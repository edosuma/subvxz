WEBVTT

00:07.674 --> 00:09.718
(crowd chatter, screaming,
cameras clicking)

00:14.806 --> 00:16.641
(lively music playing)

00:16.725 --> 00:18.393
(whoops)
Good to be back?

00:18.476 --> 00:20.812
Almost like the old days, huh?

00:20.895 --> 00:22.272
Right? Remember
that spot uptown?

00:22.355 --> 00:23.481
(chuckles)

00:23.565 --> 00:25.483
(crowd screaming)

00:25.567 --> 00:26.609
(groans)

00:26.693 --> 00:30.739
(engine revving)

00:30.822 --> 00:31.656
No! No! No, no!

00:31.740 --> 00:34.242
Stay with me!

00:34.325 --> 00:37.787
Allen, please! No!

00:39.205 --> 00:42.333
No! No, no, no, no!

00:50.550 --> 00:52.802
(siren wails and whoops)

00:52.886 --> 00:54.512
What do we got?
Drive-by shooting.

00:54.596 --> 00:56.556
Witnesses said it looks
like tonight's headliner,

00:56.639 --> 00:57.807
Cameron Gooding,
was the intended target,

00:57.891 --> 00:58.975
but his driver
got hit instead.

00:59.058 --> 01:01.436
Cameron Gooding?

01:02.562 --> 01:04.480
Cameron Gooding?

01:04.563 --> 01:06.983
You two?

01:07.066 --> 01:08.818
What, you're the only two
detectives in all of New York?

01:08.902 --> 01:10.612
Right place,
right time.

01:10.695 --> 01:11.988
Unlike your driver,
apparently.

01:12.071 --> 01:13.281
My friend.

01:13.364 --> 01:14.532
You sure
he wasn't the target?

01:14.616 --> 01:16.159
No way.

01:16.242 --> 01:18.578
He was always the good guy.

01:19.746 --> 01:22.081
Always got us home
at the end of every night.

01:22.165 --> 01:23.541
No, them bullets
were for me.

01:23.625 --> 01:25.084
Any idea who would
want you dead?

01:25.168 --> 01:27.420
Could be anyone.

01:28.588 --> 01:30.507
Maybe it was Playa Boy Shine.

01:30.590 --> 01:31.841
He called Playa Boy Shine out

01:31.925 --> 01:34.177
on his most recent album.

01:34.260 --> 01:36.221
We made amends.
Oh.

01:36.304 --> 01:37.222
What about after your scandal
broke? Any threats then?

01:37.305 --> 01:40.016
Some.

01:40.099 --> 01:42.477
Maybe you might want
to stop playing coy with us

01:42.560 --> 01:44.020
so we can figure out
who the hell it was

01:44.103 --> 01:45.522
that killed
your supposed friend.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.565
Don't you say another word!
Well, maybe

01:47.649 --> 01:49.901
you should say a word
and stop holding out!

01:50.944 --> 01:52.737
Allen was a good guy!
He didn't deserve this!

01:55.490 --> 01:57.242
It's all my fault.

01:58.451 --> 02:00.995
That should be me!

02:04.165 --> 02:05.500
That should be me.

02:05.583 --> 02:06.876
WOMAN:
Thank you again for agreeing

02:06.960 --> 02:09.545
to be a part
of our panel.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.507
Of course. Any time.

02:12.590 --> 02:14.926
A.D.A. Reagan, do
you have a minute?

02:15.009 --> 02:17.387
Oh, sure. You have
some more policy suggestions

02:17.470 --> 02:19.264
you want me to pass on
to the D.A.?

02:19.347 --> 02:20.557
Sorry. I know I can
be a little...

02:20.640 --> 02:22.225
Outspoken?

02:22.308 --> 02:25.562
No worries.

02:25.645 --> 02:27.605
You remind me a lot of myself
when I used to go here.

02:27.689 --> 02:29.566
Ramona Lewis.

02:29.649 --> 02:30.733
Nice to meet you.
Likewise.

02:30.817 --> 02:33.278
Yeah, I studied a
lot of your cases.

02:33.361 --> 02:35.947
Your career at the D.A.'s office
is something I aspire to.

02:36.030 --> 02:38.783
Well, we should talk about
you coming in for an interview.

02:40.702 --> 02:43.079
Uh, actually, I had a
different kind of favor.

02:43.162 --> 02:45.748
My best friend was murdered
a couple months ago.

02:45.832 --> 02:49.419
Oh. I'm sorry. Here in New York?

02:49.502 --> 02:51.546
She got involved with this cult
led by this guy Daniel Shapiro.

02:51.629 --> 02:53.756
And she killed herself
shortly after.

02:53.840 --> 02:54.757
I thought you said
she was murdered.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.593
Might as well have been.

02:56.676 --> 02:59.095
Shapiro convinced her
to take her own life.

02:59.178 --> 03:00.638
And your office tried to
charge him with manslaughter.

03:00.722 --> 03:02.432
Tried and failed.

03:02.515 --> 03:04.434
Well, if it's already
been investigated,

03:04.517 --> 03:06.769
there's not much
I can do to help.

03:07.854 --> 03:12.150
Then who knows how many
more lives he's gonna ruin.

03:12.233 --> 03:14.319
Please, A.D.A. Reagan,
just review the case.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.448
Her name was Yelena Page.

03:18.531 --> 03:20.533
I'll look into it.

03:23.786 --> 03:25.747
No promises.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.290
(distant siren,
indistinct chatter)

03:27.373 --> 03:28.666
Sergeant?
Boss.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.627
How's the apartment?

03:30.710 --> 03:32.128
Feels more like home
every day, sir, thank you.

03:32.211 --> 03:34.255
Good. Means a lot.

03:34.339 --> 03:36.674
I wanted to talk to you
about a rookie

03:36.758 --> 03:38.134
I assigned to your squad
last week-- Sarah Brooks.

03:38.217 --> 03:39.594
Yeah, came in with a
chip on her shoulder,

03:39.677 --> 03:40.803
but we'll make a
good cop of her yet.

03:40.887 --> 03:43.473
I don't doubt it.

03:43.556 --> 03:45.767
Um, I see she's already earned
herself a command discipline.

03:45.850 --> 03:48.269
Yeah, I visited her on post
to scratch her memo book,

03:49.395 --> 03:50.647
but she said she'd
forgotten it in her locker.
Hmm.

03:50.730 --> 03:53.483
Little harsh, isn't it?

03:53.566 --> 03:54.901
Attention to detail
is the heart of good policing.

03:54.984 --> 03:56.778
Don't start with the
platitudes, Reagan.

03:56.861 --> 03:57.695
It was her first
week on patrol.

03:57.779 --> 03:59.322
I'm a little confused, boss.

03:59.405 --> 04:01.950
You've always wanted me
to run a tight ship.

04:02.033 --> 04:04.661
Yes, but there is such a
thing as too firm a hand.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.788
Don't see how this was too firm.
It's all by the book.

04:06.871 --> 04:08.873
I wanted your side,
and I have it,

04:12.877 --> 04:14.003
but I'm ripping up the rip.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.630
CROWD (chanting):
End police violence now!

04:15.713 --> 04:17.632
All right, folks,
let's give them some space.

04:17.714 --> 04:19.341
Guys, I'm just trying
to get my kids to school.

04:19.425 --> 04:20.551
Thank you. Thank you.
MAN:
Get McKenzie off the force!

04:20.635 --> 04:21.844
Please, let us
get through.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.846
Excuse me. Excuse me.
GIRL:
Daddy!

04:23.930 --> 04:24.973
You should be
ashamed of yourself!

04:25.056 --> 04:27.392
Guys, please, please!

04:27.475 --> 04:28.726
Racist cops!
All right, all right.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.728
GIRL (on TV):
Daddy!

04:30.812 --> 04:33.564
McKENZIE (on TV):
Leave my kids alone!

04:33.648 --> 04:34.857
End police violence now!
End police violence now!

04:34.941 --> 04:38.277
End police violence now!

04:39.278 --> 04:40.989
End police violence now!
End police vi...

04:41.072 --> 04:43.116
It's been like this
since yesterday.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.705
This ain't right.

04:48.788 --> 04:49.998
GARRETT:
Someone found
his home address.

04:50.081 --> 04:52.250
What's patrol doing?

04:52.333 --> 04:53.751
Everything they can,
which isn't a lot.

04:53.835 --> 04:54.752
And what's that mean?

04:54.836 --> 04:57.672
Means you can't
use much force

04:57.755 --> 04:59.674
defending a cop accused
of excessive force.

04:59.757 --> 05:01.509
Operative word-- "accused."

05:01.592 --> 05:03.553
Which used to
mean something.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.430
"Accused" has been
replaced with "convicted"

05:05.513 --> 05:08.725
down in ye olde
public square.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.852
What happened? Did you eat
your Wheaties this morning?

05:10.935 --> 05:12.729
I just think that things have
gotten out of hand.

05:12.812 --> 05:14.022
Thank you.

05:14.105 --> 05:15.440
Welcome to our world.

05:15.523 --> 05:16.941
Pardon me, Sid,
but I'm usually

05:17.025 --> 05:18.985
the voice of reason
in your world.

05:19.068 --> 05:20.903
But when IAB,
the Bronx D.A.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.239
and the Civilian
Complaint Review Board

05:23.322 --> 05:25.074
all find no evidence
of criminality

05:25.158 --> 05:26.367
on Detective McKenzie's part...

05:26.451 --> 05:27.910
The potato keeps getting passed

05:27.994 --> 05:29.078
until they find someone
who will.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.914
GARRETT:
And they've done
exactly that.

05:31.998 --> 05:36.085
NYPD Administrative Judge
John Bradshaw informs us...

05:36.169 --> 05:38.087
His ruling on the McKenzie case.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.297
But that's good, right?
He's our guy.

05:39.380 --> 05:40.757
GARRETT:
He says

05:40.840 --> 05:42.759
McKenzie's actions may have

05:42.842 --> 05:43.926
violated department guidelines.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.763
Why the hell
would he say that?

05:46.846 --> 05:49.432
One doesn't always make
one's bones

05:49.515 --> 05:52.268
by going along
with the establishment.

05:52.351 --> 05:53.978
People tend to change
when the spotlight's on them,

05:54.854 --> 05:56.105
and he just grabbed it.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.357
GORMLEY:
You think

05:58.441 --> 06:02.612
our own guy
would hammer McKenzie?

06:02.695 --> 06:04.739
If our own guy
is now maybe his own guy.

06:10.995 --> 06:13.831
Yeah.

06:32.767 --> 06:35.812
♪ ♪

06:35.895 --> 06:38.106
A.D.A. Flynn really dropped
the ball on this Shapiro case.

06:38.189 --> 06:40.942
What'd you find?
A real botch job.

06:41.025 --> 06:42.318
It's like he opened the
milk, took one bad whiff,

06:42.401 --> 06:44.779
put it back in the fridge.

06:44.862 --> 06:46.989
Guess it's a good thing
he's no longer with us.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.617
I'll say. He missed allegations
of a pyramid scheme,

06:49.700 --> 06:52.203
dropped domestic
violence complaints,

06:52.286 --> 06:55.039
missing persons reports
from worried parents.

06:55.123 --> 06:58.000
You're saying Shapiro's
been kidnapping these girls?

06:58.084 --> 07:00.002
They usually turn up a couple of
weeks later, refusing to talk.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.338
I mean, it's all
very spooky.

07:02.421 --> 07:04.507
You speak to anyone
in his cult?

07:04.590 --> 07:07.176
Yeah, I-I poked around their
little co-op in Brooklyn,

07:08.386 --> 07:09.679
but they clammed up
when they realized who I was.

07:09.762 --> 07:11.180
You know, Ramona was right.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.849
We really failed her friend.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.976
Want to go after this guy?

07:15.059 --> 07:17.019
Yeah. But we're gonna need

07:18.437 --> 07:21.482
to get someone
in his circle to talk.

07:23.609 --> 07:26.154
I think I got just the
person for the job.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.369
(indistinct crowd chatter)

07:33.452 --> 07:35.705
(indistinct chatter)

07:40.585 --> 07:42.545
Go.

07:42.628 --> 07:43.921
Expecting that 49 later today,
Sergeant.

07:47.175 --> 07:49.218
Yes, sir, I'll get
it right to you.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.554
There a question
go with that look?

07:51.637 --> 07:54.265
No, sir.

08:03.274 --> 08:04.775
Good.

08:04.859 --> 08:06.777
What's up?

08:06.861 --> 08:07.904
We're looking for Pia Toledo.
That's what's up.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.864
Who's looking?

08:09.947 --> 08:11.073
Well, I'm Mister Rogers,

08:11.157 --> 08:12.700
and this is my neighborhood,

08:12.783 --> 08:13.784
so answer
the question.

08:19.123 --> 08:21.626
Where's Pia Toledo?

08:21.709 --> 08:24.295
Pia Toledo?
Who the hell are you?

08:24.378 --> 08:26.505
I'm Detectives Reagan.
This is Detective Baez.

08:30.801 --> 08:32.303
And you can wait outside.

08:32.385 --> 08:34.388
What's with the muscle?

08:34.472 --> 08:36.307
You worried about
some sort of retribution?

08:36.390 --> 08:38.768
I don't know about that shooting
if that's why you're here.

08:38.851 --> 08:40.937
Hmm.
Gooding allegedly
assaulted you.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.355
And from what we heard,
your career pretty much ended

08:42.438 --> 08:44.565
after the scandal broke.

08:44.649 --> 08:46.984
Yeah, I got blacklisted.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.736
Labeled as one of those girls
sleeps her way to the top.

08:48.819 --> 08:50.947
Nice world we live in, huh?

08:51.030 --> 08:52.615
But that doesn't mean
I tried to kill him.

08:52.698 --> 08:54.784
We went through his phone
and found

08:54.867 --> 08:57.787
you'd sent him a slew
of threats-- death threats.

08:57.870 --> 09:00.873
You've never heard of hyperbole?
A rapper's bread and butter?

09:00.957 --> 09:02.917
Okay. Where were you
two nights ago at 11:30 p.m.?

09:03.000 --> 09:05.253
Asleep... in this room.

09:05.336 --> 09:06.671
And is there anyone
who can verify that for you?

09:06.754 --> 09:08.839
(chuckles)
Wouldn't you like to know.

09:08.923 --> 09:10.841
The hotel's got
cameras, don't they?

09:10.925 --> 09:12.301
Yeah, and we plan
on taking a look at them.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.845
In the meantime, you worked

09:14.929 --> 09:16.806
with Dead Dove Records
for a long time.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.140
Can you think of anyone else
in Cameron Gooding's universe

09:18.224 --> 09:19.308
who might want to see him dead?

09:19.392 --> 09:20.810
Most of those players left.

09:20.893 --> 09:22.812
Why is that?

09:22.895 --> 09:24.939
After his business partner
went to prison,

09:25.022 --> 09:27.316
Gooding ran Dead Dove Records
right into the ground.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.859
You're saying
the record label is broke?

09:28.943 --> 09:32.530
Yep, and so is he.

09:32.613 --> 09:33.948
Word is, he owes all
sorts of unsavory types.

09:34.031 --> 09:36.867
Like who?
I don't know.

09:38.035 --> 09:39.954
But I'm telling you,
the king is dead.

09:43.082 --> 09:44.667
Figuratively speaking.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.210
I know you've been
undercover before,

09:46.294 --> 09:47.670
but this ain't
a one-time op.

09:47.753 --> 09:48.504
We want you to go deep.

09:48.587 --> 09:50.715
I'm ready.

09:50.798 --> 09:51.841
Are you? I mean,
you're ready to adapt,

09:51.924 --> 09:54.302
to improvise,

09:54.385 --> 09:56.012
to stay in character even
if there's a gun to your head?

09:56.095 --> 09:58.222
Well, I think so.
You see,

09:58.306 --> 10:00.975
if you hesitate like that,
you'll be made in a second.

10:01.058 --> 10:02.893
Lucky for you,
you got me to teach you.

10:04.937 --> 10:07.189
They used to call me
"the Chameleon."

10:07.273 --> 10:10.526
This is Ramona Lewis.

10:10.609 --> 10:12.528
She brought the case to Erin,
and Yelena Page,

10:12.611 --> 10:15.865
her best friend
who offed herself,

10:15.948 --> 10:18.909
thanks to this guy--
Daniel Shapiro, the ringleader.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.911
He runs a supposed
wellness group

10:20.995 --> 10:23.831
based upstate and in Brooklyn.

10:23.914 --> 10:27.501
We've identified a girl
we think is a weak link.

10:27.585 --> 10:29.378
We'd like you to go undercover
and get her to open up.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.881
Is Shapiro dangerous?

10:31.964 --> 10:32.757
We think so. There's been,
uh, several disappearances

10:32.840 --> 10:35.259
around him.

10:35.343 --> 10:38.262
Evidence suggests
he maintains control

10:38.346 --> 10:40.890
over these girls through
violence and sexual coercion.

10:40.973 --> 10:43.017
Gifts that he may very well try
to share with you.

10:44.101 --> 10:45.603
Still think you're up to this?

10:49.482 --> 10:51.650
I'm ready.

10:51.734 --> 10:52.943
(siren wails in distance)

10:53.027 --> 10:55.237
We noticed you...
(indistinct chatter)

10:55.321 --> 10:57.239
One second.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.159
Do you mind?

11:00.242 --> 11:02.912
As I was saying,

11:02.995 --> 11:03.996
we noticed you haven't canceled
any of your tour dates yet.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.456
Why not?

11:05.539 --> 11:06.874
I'm not about to
be intimidated.

11:06.957 --> 11:08.584
Or maybe you're just
so strapped for cash,

11:08.668 --> 11:10.419
you can't afford
to take a day off?

11:10.503 --> 11:11.921
What are you talking about?
Dead Dove's

11:12.004 --> 11:14.256
headphone line tanked.

11:14.340 --> 11:17.426
You've had a mass exodus
of young artists.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.677
And your penthouse is listed for
half the normal asking price.

11:18.761 --> 11:20.888
And this just, coincidentally,

11:20.971 --> 11:22.014
happens to be
your first tour since '09.

11:22.098 --> 11:23.766
So what?
You're keeping

11:23.849 --> 11:25.601
the label afloat out
of your pocket,

11:25.684 --> 11:27.603
and you're about to go down
with the ship.

11:27.686 --> 11:28.646
It's nothing I can't handle
with a little bit of hustle.

11:28.729 --> 11:30.106
DANNY:
Hustle?

11:30.189 --> 11:31.232
Like you used to do
on the street?

11:31.315 --> 11:33.943
What's that supposed to mean?
You know,

11:34.026 --> 11:34.944
like you did in your past life,
before you were a star.

11:35.027 --> 11:36.487
The stuff you rap about.

11:36.570 --> 11:38.155
Guns, drugs, money.

11:38.239 --> 11:39.657
So you think I'm dealing, huh?

11:39.740 --> 11:42.660
Come on. Give me a break.

11:42.743 --> 11:43.494
Maybe dealing with the dealers.
No.

11:43.577 --> 11:45.079
DANNY:
Well, we know
about the large

11:45.162 --> 11:46.580
sums of cash
you've been depositing.

11:46.664 --> 11:47.957
I sold a couple of my cars.

11:48.040 --> 11:48.916
So what, okay?

11:48.999 --> 11:49.708
Now I got to get back to work.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.794
Look,

11:51.877 --> 11:53.337
how many of your friends
got to die

11:54.588 --> 11:58.926
before you come clean with us?

11:59.009 --> 12:01.429
Or maybe you really didn't care
that much about Allen after all.

12:01.512 --> 12:03.431
We're trying to help you here.

12:08.060 --> 12:09.979
Just tell us who you owe.

12:10.062 --> 12:10.980
Guy that runs the block
that I came up on.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.607
Damien Ross.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.484
But I can swear to you,
he wouldn't do this.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.154
And I can swear to you,
we probably have

12:26.120 --> 12:28.038
a few outstanding warrants
on this Damien Ross.

12:28.122 --> 12:29.165
(door closes)

12:29.248 --> 12:31.000
JAMIE:
Hey.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.460
Hey.

12:34.253 --> 12:36.505
Mind if I join you?

12:36.589 --> 12:39.884
Everything good at home?

12:39.967 --> 12:41.385
Well, aside from her working
nights and me days, yeah.

12:41.469 --> 12:43.053
(chuckles)

12:44.930 --> 12:46.849
Oh, my.

12:46.932 --> 12:48.809
Run something past you, Dad?

12:49.768 --> 12:52.396
Shoot.

12:52.480 --> 12:56.025
Say you had
a higher-up

12:56.108 --> 12:57.860
who you thought was maybe
using his position to...

12:57.943 --> 12:59.862
get over with a rookie.

12:59.945 --> 13:01.363
An attractive female rookie?

13:01.447 --> 13:03.365
Yeah. And you get
the strong impression

13:03.449 --> 13:06.744
that he expected you
to look the other way.

13:07.786 --> 13:09.246
Espinoza never struck
me as the type.

13:09.330 --> 13:12.166
Didn't say it was him.

13:14.126 --> 13:15.711
No, you didn't.

13:15.794 --> 13:17.213
Our apartment,
Espinoza was the one

13:17.296 --> 13:18.839
who signed the lease over to us.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.007
Said no strings attached.

13:20.090 --> 13:21.008
And now you're feeling strings.

13:21.091 --> 13:22.510
The last couple days,

13:22.593 --> 13:24.762
he tore up a rip
that I gave her,

13:24.845 --> 13:26.222
and I saw the two of 'em
come into work in the morning.

13:26.305 --> 13:27.890
Together.

13:27.973 --> 13:30.100
In his car.

13:30.184 --> 13:32.186
Well, no crime in that.

13:32.269 --> 13:35.189
No.

13:35.272 --> 13:38.192
But something's off.

13:38.275 --> 13:40.027
And on account of the
apartment, you owe him one.

13:40.110 --> 13:42.738
Guy's been nothing
but good to me.

13:42.821 --> 13:44.949
But if he's using his authority
to seduce a young cop,

13:45.032 --> 13:46.825
I can't just look the other way.

13:48.619 --> 13:51.747
Right?

13:51.830 --> 13:53.541
Not in this day and age.

13:53.624 --> 13:55.209
On the other hand...

13:56.210 --> 13:58.379
(exhales)

13:59.380 --> 14:01.048
It's just us here, Dad.

14:01.131 --> 14:05.094
(sighs)
Well,

14:05.177 --> 14:07.137
it was me who asked IAB to
investigate Detective McKenzie.

14:07.221 --> 14:08.180
I mean, there were
legit complaints.

14:08.264 --> 14:12.101
He wasn't spotless.

14:12.184 --> 14:13.477
But absolutely no evidence
of excessive force.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.104
Doesn't seem to matter.

14:15.187 --> 14:16.855
The way the public's
gone after him,

14:16.939 --> 14:18.440
y-you'd think
he killed somebody.

14:18.524 --> 14:22.069
Yeah, tell me about it.

14:22.152 --> 14:23.779
And now a judge is inserting
himself in the process.

14:23.862 --> 14:26.323
Why?

14:26.407 --> 14:28.492
He's one of our own.
You tell me.

14:28.576 --> 14:30.744
Either to make a name
for himself

14:30.828 --> 14:32.246
or to clear the detective
once and for all.

14:32.329 --> 14:34.498
Yeah, but even if he clears him,

14:34.582 --> 14:38.961
you think the crowds
chanting "racist" are gonna stop

14:39.044 --> 14:41.088
because a cop says
a fellow cop isn't one?

14:41.171 --> 14:43.966
So there is
no "once and for all"?

14:44.049 --> 14:46.969
No. The outcome of
the investigation won't matter.

14:47.052 --> 14:51.265
Once it started,
he was tried, convicted

14:53.225 --> 14:54.893
and executed
in the court of public opinion.

14:58.981 --> 15:03.235
Think I should skip IAB?

15:03.319 --> 15:06.196
If you ask for Espinoza
to be investigated and it leaks,

15:06.280 --> 15:10.034
as it may,

15:17.583 --> 15:19.126
it won't matter
if IAB turns up nothing.

15:23.714 --> 15:25.633
♪ ♪

15:25.716 --> 15:26.717
Take those beads off.
You look like Miss Cleo.

15:26.800 --> 15:27.760
Wait, don't they wear
this kind of stuff?

15:27.843 --> 15:28.969
Too on the nose.

15:29.053 --> 15:30.554
Lose 'em.

15:30.638 --> 15:32.514
Mm.
Good.

15:32.598 --> 15:35.851
Now, you remember
your U.C. name?

15:35.934 --> 15:37.186
Jess Maitland,
transplant of Wisconsin.

15:37.269 --> 15:39.647
Father went to jail.

15:39.730 --> 15:41.565
Ran away from
my domineering mother, which,

15:41.649 --> 15:43.108
by the way,
a little close to home.

15:43.192 --> 15:44.526
Lends you authenticity.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.153
Plus, it'll help you
stay in character

15:46.236 --> 15:47.696
if there's a gun to your head.

15:47.780 --> 15:48.697
Gee, thanks.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.074
Establish trust first,

15:50.157 --> 15:51.241
then ask about Shapiro.

15:51.325 --> 15:52.368
Got it.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.662
B-But don't be too direct.

15:54.745 --> 15:57.206
Okay.
But don't be too shy,
either. Be personable.

15:57.289 --> 15:59.708
You seem more nervous than I am.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.543
Well, you bet I'm nervous.
I'm not about to have a Reagan

16:01.627 --> 16:03.545
get made and killed
on my watch.

16:03.629 --> 16:04.713
These girls, they seem harmless.

16:04.797 --> 16:05.839
Ever hear of Charles Manson?

16:05.923 --> 16:08.258
More or less.
Yeah, well,

16:08.342 --> 16:10.052
he had a bunch of brainwashed
girls around him, too.

16:10.135 --> 16:11.553
And they murdered for sport.

16:11.637 --> 16:14.348
Oh. Right.

16:14.431 --> 16:16.225
If something goes wrong,

16:16.308 --> 16:18.727
it's just you out there.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.270
I hope you're as ready
as you think you are.

16:22.648 --> 16:25.150
I am.

16:36.787 --> 16:38.789
Go get 'em.

16:45.421 --> 16:46.422
(door opens, chimes tinkle)

16:46.505 --> 16:47.589
I'm sorry.

16:47.673 --> 16:48.590
Uh...

16:48.674 --> 16:50.050
could you help me?

16:50.134 --> 16:51.719
I'm-I'm kind of new to all this.

16:51.802 --> 16:53.429
Of course, dear.

16:53.512 --> 16:56.765
What are you looking for?

16:56.849 --> 16:58.767
Well, I was told that
the-the crystals have certain,

16:58.851 --> 17:01.770
um, properties.

17:01.854 --> 17:05.733
Amethyst is good for
psychic practitioners.

17:05.816 --> 17:07.776
Malachite to connect
to the heart chakra.

17:08.736 --> 17:10.779
Moonstone...

17:10.863 --> 17:13.615
...for healing a bad romance.

17:13.699 --> 17:15.367
Depends on what
you're looking for.

17:16.367 --> 17:19.371
I'm not sure, exactly.

17:20.748 --> 17:22.624
You seem a little nervous.

17:22.708 --> 17:25.169
I am, kinda.

17:25.252 --> 17:25.961
It's okay, dear.
This is a safe space.

17:26.044 --> 17:27.296
Ruby.

17:27.378 --> 17:28.130
Jess. Nice to meet you.

17:28.213 --> 17:30.340
Are you new in town?

17:30.424 --> 17:31.800
That obvious, huh?
(chuckles softly)

17:31.884 --> 17:33.635
I came...

17:33.719 --> 17:35.012
I came here for a fresh start.

17:35.095 --> 17:37.639
Let me guess.

17:39.224 --> 17:41.310
(inhales deeply)
Boyfriend?

17:41.393 --> 17:44.772
No.

17:44.855 --> 17:46.273
It's family issues,
isn't it?

17:46.356 --> 17:48.650
Family.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.611
A deeper pain.

17:50.694 --> 17:52.321
I could tell...

17:52.404 --> 17:55.699
by your energy.

17:55.783 --> 17:59.661
Hey, do you th-think
you could help me?

17:59.745 --> 18:03.165
You didn't come here
for the crystals, did you?

18:03.248 --> 18:04.374
You came because you heard
that we help people like you.

18:04.458 --> 18:08.045
I hope so.

18:08.128 --> 18:09.379
A lot of people come here
with a bad past.

18:09.463 --> 18:12.508
We take them in,

18:12.591 --> 18:13.675
give 'em the community
they were always missing.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.385
Heal old wounds.

18:15.469 --> 18:18.722
That sounds nice.

18:18.806 --> 18:20.891
We're having
a small gathering tomorrow.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.811
Be my plus-one.

18:23.894 --> 18:26.188
Oh, I don't know.

18:26.271 --> 18:28.482
I promise you,

18:28.565 --> 18:30.859
it will be worth it.

18:35.864 --> 18:37.074
Okay.

18:37.157 --> 18:39.243
Damien Ross.

18:39.326 --> 18:41.995
Outstanding warrants
for drug possession,

18:42.079 --> 18:44.039
weapons possession
and felony assault.

18:44.122 --> 18:45.040
How'd you know where to find me?

18:45.124 --> 18:46.583
Little birdie told us.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.043
Yeah, well,
that birdie's dead.

18:48.126 --> 18:49.878
Well, it won't be by your hand.

18:49.962 --> 18:50.879
Like my partner said,
we got a whole buffet

18:50.963 --> 18:51.880
of charges against you.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.006
Don't care.

18:53.090 --> 18:54.591
Hmm.
So many, it's
hard to know

18:54.675 --> 18:55.592
which to dig into first.

18:55.676 --> 18:58.846
Still don't care.

18:58.929 --> 19:00.305
Well, how about if we
put murder on the table?

19:00.389 --> 19:01.807
Care now?

19:01.890 --> 19:03.767
Lawyer.

19:03.851 --> 19:05.727
(sighs)
I hate this dialect of perp.

19:05.811 --> 19:08.564
Gives me such a headache.

19:08.647 --> 19:09.565
Yeah. Translates
to "give me the max sentence."

19:09.648 --> 19:10.399
Look, I ain't saying anything
without one.

19:10.482 --> 19:13.402
I heard you
the first time.

19:13.485 --> 19:16.405
But, just between us,
what was it?

19:16.488 --> 19:19.116
Did you get tired of waiting
for Cameron to pay you back?

19:20.492 --> 19:22.911
You wanted to reacquaint
him with street justice?

19:22.995 --> 19:25.706
I guess you're right.
Let's go talk to the D.A.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.250
Look, look. Wait. You-you think
I tried to off Gooding?

19:28.333 --> 19:29.585
That sound like English to you?

19:30.627 --> 19:31.753
Couldn't be.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.547
Why would I try to kill Gooding?

19:33.630 --> 19:35.841
Ah, he speaks English,

19:37.217 --> 19:38.427
but he doesn't
understand English.

19:38.510 --> 19:39.845
You tried to kill Gooding

19:39.928 --> 19:43.223
because he owes you money.
That's why.

19:43.307 --> 19:46.226
(chuckles)
Exactly why I'd want him alive.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.228
Fame and talent like that,
he's the surest bet I ever made.

19:48.312 --> 19:50.898
Then why you sending muscle
to his place?

19:50.981 --> 19:52.441
I call it
protecting our investment.

19:52.524 --> 19:54.109
Or intimidation?

19:54.192 --> 19:55.777
Look, I swear.

19:55.861 --> 19:56.904
We worship Gooding
on the corner.

19:56.987 --> 19:57.988
I'd never take a shot at him.

19:58.071 --> 19:59.448
Someone did.

19:59.531 --> 20:02.075
Well, it wasn't me.

20:02.159 --> 20:03.744
If I took him out,
it'd be me the next day.

20:03.827 --> 20:05.621
And if I knew who tried this,

20:06.872 --> 20:10.208
you can bet they wouldn't be
around no more, neither.

20:12.377 --> 20:14.087
Look, that's the truth,
Detectives.

20:21.178 --> 20:23.472
(copy machine whirs)

20:23.555 --> 20:24.932
Judge ruled
on Detective McKenzie.

20:27.726 --> 20:30.020
He's recommending termination.

20:30.103 --> 20:31.438
The judge just made his bones.

20:31.521 --> 20:32.356
Recommending to who?

20:32.439 --> 20:35.400
Him.

20:35.484 --> 20:36.818
I get the potato.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.612
Well, what's he basing it on?

20:38.695 --> 20:40.322
"The preponderance
of credible evidence."

20:40.405 --> 20:41.615
Evidence which no one else
seemed to think

20:41.698 --> 20:43.700
merited a suspension.

20:43.784 --> 20:44.868
I'm not gonna ask.
Ask what?

20:44.952 --> 20:45.869
What he's gonna do.

20:45.953 --> 20:46.745
Well, that part's easy.

20:46.828 --> 20:48.330
GARRETT:
It is?

20:48.413 --> 20:49.831
We're gonna stand
behind our people,

20:49.915 --> 20:50.958
same as we always do.

20:51.041 --> 20:52.292
It's not the same.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.002
Look, if I cave on this,

20:54.086 --> 20:56.004
One PP caves with me.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.965
When I choose
to leave this place,

20:58.048 --> 21:00.008
it's gonna be
by walking out that door,

21:00.092 --> 21:01.635
not picking my way
through a pile of rubble.

21:01.718 --> 21:04.346
Not sure that's gonna
play on Broadway.

21:04.429 --> 21:08.183
You're right, Garrett.
It isn't the same.

21:08.266 --> 21:11.728
It is ten times more important
than when I took this office,

21:11.812 --> 21:14.773
before the airwaves and the
Internet became the courtroom

21:16.316 --> 21:17.776
and the public
became judge and jury.

21:23.907 --> 21:25.826
(sighs)

21:25.909 --> 21:28.203
An officer come in?

21:28.286 --> 21:30.205
Not today.

21:30.288 --> 21:31.915
Thanks.

21:31.999 --> 21:35.002
2-9 Sergeant to Central.

21:35.085 --> 21:36.878
Can you raise patrol post 16 on
the air and ascertain her 10-7?

21:36.962 --> 21:39.047
Officer is missing from
her designated meal location

21:41.633 --> 21:43.051
at this time.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.220
Disregard, Central.

21:45.303 --> 21:48.056
The officer in question
has been accounted for.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.017
Officer Brooks,
where the hell were you?

21:50.100 --> 21:51.560
I decided midafternoon pizza
wasn't such a good idea,

21:51.643 --> 21:52.561
and this place
has killer salads.

21:52.644 --> 21:53.687
You should've called
it in if you were gonna

21:53.770 --> 21:56.023
change your meal location.
Yeah, it was just

21:56.106 --> 21:57.774
down the block. I didn't think
that was such a big deal.

21:57.858 --> 22:00.068
I could've thought you were
involved in a police action.

22:00.152 --> 22:02.237
(chuckles): Geez, take it easy,
Sarge. It's just a salad.

22:02.320 --> 22:05.157
10-2 the house. You just got
yourself another one.

22:06.158 --> 22:08.535
A rip? You mean like last time?

22:10.704 --> 22:12.080
10-2 the house-- now.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.957
(sighs)

22:19.713 --> 22:22.090
(siren whooping)

22:22.174 --> 22:24.926
Tell me this
is some sort of joke.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.386
Officer Brooks wasn't present
at her reported meal location.

22:26.470 --> 22:27.429
She was 50 feet away.

22:27.512 --> 22:28.597
She still should've
called it in.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.098
She could've been in trouble.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.267
You've got something
against her?

22:32.350 --> 22:33.935
No, sir.
Then you've got
something against me.

22:34.019 --> 22:34.895
I don't follow, boss.
You didn't like

22:34.978 --> 22:36.938
the fact that I tossed your rip,

22:37.022 --> 22:38.982
wanted to find a way
to give her another one.

22:39.066 --> 22:40.859
No, that's not it at all.
What, then?

22:40.942 --> 22:42.402
She's entitled,
and it's only a matter of time

22:42.486 --> 22:44.654
before that chip
on her shoulder puts her

22:44.738 --> 22:46.490
or someone else in danger.
I put her on your squad

22:46.573 --> 22:48.116
so that you could teach
her, not toss the book

22:48.200 --> 22:50.118
at her every time
she breathes funny.

22:50.202 --> 22:52.120
I'm ripping this one up, too.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.164
You sure that's the only reason
that you put her on my squad?

22:54.247 --> 22:55.457
Excuse me?
You've never thrown out
one of my CDs before.

22:55.540 --> 22:56.666
And now you've done it twice.

22:56.750 --> 22:58.418
What exactly are you implying?

22:58.502 --> 23:00.295
I'm not implying anything.
I'm just pointing out a fact.

23:00.378 --> 23:02.172
Here's a fact:
you question me on this again,

23:02.255 --> 23:03.465
and it won't be
a rookie getting the rip.

23:04.508 --> 23:05.759
You hear me?

23:17.562 --> 23:21.817
Loud and clear.

23:21.900 --> 23:24.319
My father wasn't arrested,
but he left me, too.

23:24.402 --> 23:27.322
I struggled with it
for a long time.

23:27.405 --> 23:29.157
After I met Daniel,
everything changed.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.159
Daniel Shapiro, right?

23:31.243 --> 23:32.035
Yeah.
What's he like?

23:32.119 --> 23:35.205
He's great.

23:35.288 --> 23:37.165
A brilliant mind
and the most open heart.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.750
He founded this group

23:38.834 --> 23:41.169
to share them both.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.964
I heard he had some trouble
with his ex-girlfriend.

23:45.048 --> 23:47.968
You're talking about
Yelena Page?

23:48.051 --> 23:50.178
Yelena had a lot of bad energy.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.347
The whole case against him
is because people just

23:52.430 --> 23:55.308
don't understand what it is
that we do here.

23:55.392 --> 23:58.186
What is it that you do
do here?

23:58.270 --> 24:00.063
Well...
Why, we help each
other heal, of course.

24:01.106 --> 24:02.190
(laughs softly)

24:02.274 --> 24:05.026
Jess,

24:05.110 --> 24:06.570
this is Daniel Shapiro.

24:06.653 --> 24:09.531
A pleasure.

24:09.614 --> 24:11.199
I see you've already met Ruby,
the gem of us all.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.577
(laughs):
Please.

24:13.660 --> 24:16.163
Where are you from, Jess?
Wisconsin.

24:16.246 --> 24:18.415
Midwest girl,
born and raised.

24:18.498 --> 24:20.041
Jess lost her father, too.
He went to prison

24:20.125 --> 24:22.210
when she was young.

24:22.294 --> 24:24.212
I'm sorry to hear that.
What for?

24:24.296 --> 24:26.756
He was running a Ponzi scheme.

24:26.840 --> 24:29.676
I thought you said
that it was domestic violence.

24:29.759 --> 24:32.012
It was, the first time.

24:33.638 --> 24:36.725
Oh.
It sounds complicated.

24:36.808 --> 24:38.894
Daniel runs a meditation retreat
at our farm upstate.

24:38.977 --> 24:40.812
There's one coming up,
if you're interested.

24:40.896 --> 24:42.230
I'll think about it.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.232
We'd love to have you.

24:44.316 --> 24:45.233
I'm sure there's so much
we could learn from each other.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.360
RUBY:
Mm.

24:47.444 --> 24:49.738
WOMAN: It's so nice to see
you again, Tracy.

24:49.821 --> 24:52.240
Ah, our other newcomer.

24:54.201 --> 24:56.119
If you'll excuse me.

24:56.203 --> 24:57.954
Who's that girl?

24:58.038 --> 24:59.706
RUBY:
Tracy.

25:00.874 --> 25:03.376
She's been coming
around the shop lately.

25:09.299 --> 25:10.383
Something off about
her, if you ask me.

25:10.467 --> 25:12.260
(door opens)

25:12.344 --> 25:14.804
Detective McKenzie.

25:15.847 --> 25:17.265
Yeah.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.352
Commissioner.

25:29.277 --> 25:33.281
Sit down, please.

25:33.365 --> 25:36.201
Okay, first of all,
I'm so sorry about all this.

25:36.284 --> 25:39.371
I can take it.
My family, not so much.

25:40.372 --> 25:43.083
Nobody should have
to go through this.

25:43.166 --> 25:46.253
All due respect, boss,

25:46.336 --> 25:49.089
your initial notification to IAB
is what kicked this all off.

25:49.172 --> 25:52.968
Well, as I think you know,

25:53.051 --> 25:55.512
we have a policy
for pursuing due diligence.

25:55.595 --> 25:56.972
Well, this judge is the one
who should be investigated.

25:57.055 --> 25:58.974
(chuckles):
Well, I can't do that.

25:59.057 --> 26:00.141
It would look like
I'm strong-arming him.

26:00.225 --> 26:01.309
But he's just playing
to the peanut gallery

26:01.393 --> 26:03.687
and exaggerating my record.

26:03.770 --> 26:06.898
And any cop with a great career

26:08.233 --> 26:10.902
is bound to have
a few complaints on his sheet.

26:12.362 --> 26:14.447
Nothing I've done deserves this.

26:14.531 --> 26:16.992
What? You agree with him?

26:17.075 --> 26:19.953
Good God, no.

26:20.036 --> 26:23.164
I'm rejecting his recommendation
for termination.

26:23.248 --> 26:25.500
I'm announcing that at a press
conference tomorrow morning.

26:27.419 --> 26:29.629
That's it?

26:29.713 --> 26:31.339
Passing the buck,
that's all that is.

26:33.383 --> 26:34.718
All due respect.

26:34.801 --> 26:37.470
None taken.

26:37.554 --> 26:39.764
You got to shut this down,
once and for all.

26:39.848 --> 26:41.641
Shout it out loud
t-to city hall,

26:41.725 --> 26:44.978
to the A.G. up in Albany,

26:45.061 --> 26:47.355
to the civil courts judges:
no more going after this guy.

26:47.439 --> 26:48.690
I can't do that, Detective.
Well, you're the
police commissioner.

26:48.773 --> 26:51.359
Who can speak out
for this office

26:54.279 --> 26:58.158
but this office only.

26:58.241 --> 27:01.661
I haven't been able
to get my kids to school.

27:01.745 --> 27:04.205
And yesterday, my wife
had a bottle thrown at her.

27:04.289 --> 27:07.000
Look, you want police escorts,
you got them.

27:07.083 --> 27:10.003
Who wants to live like that?

27:10.086 --> 27:13.423
And my children seeing me on TV,

27:16.301 --> 27:19.888
every step I take
like a perp walk?

27:26.436 --> 27:28.313
They used to look at me
like I was their hero.

27:30.315 --> 27:32.233
I didn't dismiss you, Detective.

27:32.317 --> 27:36.404
I'm sorry, Commissioner,

27:36.488 --> 27:38.531
but I won't put my family
through this any longer.

27:40.158 --> 27:41.701
Let's give the public
what it wants.

27:41.785 --> 27:45.372
And what's that?

27:47.207 --> 27:48.917
Me, gone.

27:53.338 --> 27:57.300
(sets shield on desk)

27:58.343 --> 28:00.345
You walk away,
you're letting them win.

28:10.021 --> 28:12.190
They already have.

28:12.273 --> 28:13.358
(sighs)

28:28.540 --> 28:29.499
Sir?

28:31.376 --> 28:33.795
(sighs)

28:33.878 --> 28:35.255
And you're sure it was Ramona?
I double-checked

28:36.423 --> 28:38.425
the picture you showed me.

28:38.508 --> 28:40.802
Well, maybe she went down
there to dig for dirt

28:40.885 --> 28:42.345
after I blew her off
at the panel, but...

28:42.429 --> 28:44.389
You told her
that you'd look into it.

28:44.472 --> 28:46.474
I told her, "No promises,"

28:48.226 --> 28:49.769
but maybe she just heard, "No."

28:49.853 --> 28:51.646
The phone is dead.

28:51.729 --> 28:54.482
Roommate hasn't seen her
since Friday.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.192
She failed to show up for class
this morning,

28:56.276 --> 28:58.027
which, apparently,
is unlike her.

28:59.070 --> 29:00.822
Family hear anything?
Nada.

29:00.905 --> 29:02.657
Ruby was
already suspicious of her.

29:02.740 --> 29:04.409
Probably didn't take
Shapiro long to figure out

29:04.492 --> 29:05.326
she was Yelena's roommate.

29:05.410 --> 29:07.328
And where are you going?

29:07.412 --> 29:08.496
I'm gonna go look
for this Ruby girl.

29:08.580 --> 29:09.831
Come on. Not again.
Anthony,

29:09.914 --> 29:11.207
we're running out of time.

29:11.291 --> 29:13.126
Erin, we got this.

29:13.209 --> 29:15.170
We're gonna find her.

29:17.130 --> 29:19.382
I promise.

29:19.466 --> 29:21.509
♪ ♪

29:22.552 --> 29:23.511
(door opens, chimes tinkle)

29:27.807 --> 29:29.350
Jess!

29:29.434 --> 29:30.685
Wait. What's going on?

29:30.768 --> 29:33.146
Tell her, Eddie.

29:33.229 --> 29:35.482
Eddie? You're not Jess?

29:35.565 --> 29:37.358
We need to know where we
can find Daniel Shapiro.

29:37.442 --> 29:38.693
I don't understand.
You're a cop?

29:38.776 --> 29:40.069
Yes.
But...

29:40.153 --> 29:43.281
why?

29:43.364 --> 29:45.533
Why are you guys
always going after him?

29:45.617 --> 29:47.952
There's a girl missing.
You know her as Tracy.

29:48.036 --> 29:50.038
She was last seen
with Shapiro.

29:50.121 --> 29:51.331
That doesn't mean
that he did anything.

29:51.414 --> 29:52.499
Look, we don't have
time for games.

29:52.582 --> 29:54.209
Where the hell is he?

29:54.292 --> 29:55.376
He wouldn't do anything
to her. I swear.

29:55.460 --> 29:56.711
JANKO:
Ruby,

29:56.794 --> 29:58.755
I know this is hard,

30:00.298 --> 30:03.009
You lied to me.

30:03.092 --> 30:04.344
Everything you said
was a lie.
No, no.

30:04.427 --> 30:06.930
Everything Shapiro does

30:40.380 --> 30:41.923
I thought that you
could talk to her

30:42.006 --> 30:43.633
about the upcoming retreat.

30:45.969 --> 30:47.262
I told you I didn't

Fine.

Mm-hmm.

What are you looking at?

Surveillance footage of Pia's
hotel, night of the shooting.

33:08.027 --> 33:09.570
BAEZ:
But we put her on
the back burner.

33:09.654 --> 33:11.531
She was in by 9:00 p.m.

33:11.614 --> 33:12.615
and not out again
until the next morning.

33:12.699 --> 33:13.658
Except she wasn't
the only person

33:16.744 --> 33:18.454
who slept there that night.

33:18.538 --> 33:19.747
Her bodyguard?

33:19.831 --> 33:22.250
Ky Bishop.

33:22.333 --> 33:24.544
And he didn't sleep
in his own room.

33:24.627 --> 33:27.588
They're sleeping together?
Looks like.

33:27.672 --> 33:29.507
Here he is slipping out of
the back door of the hotel

33:29.590 --> 33:31.634
at 11:00 p.m.,

33:31.718 --> 33:33.469
and here is him
not returning to the hotel

33:33.553 --> 33:35.221
until 4:00 a.m.

33:35.304 --> 33:36.764
Fits the timeline
of the shooting.

33:36.848 --> 33:37.932
Sure as hell does.
You think Pia sent him

33:38.015 --> 33:40.268
to do her dirty work?

33:40.351 --> 33:42.979
Or he caught
feelings for her

33:43.062 --> 33:44.814
and tried to avenge her
honor with Gooding somehow.

33:44.897 --> 33:47.108
Sounds like a real love story.

33:47.191 --> 33:49.902
Well, the love story
just took another twist.

33:49.986 --> 33:51.904
Ky Bishop was just added
as a backstage guest

33:51.988 --> 33:53.156

tonight.

33:53.239 --> 33:54.574
What time does it start?

34:04.709 --> 34:06.919
Now.

34:07.003 --> 34:08.629
(knock on door)
Yeah?

34:08.713 --> 34:10.630
They're ready for you.

34:10.715 --> 34:13.134
(indistinct chatter)

34:14.092 --> 34:16.053
Let's do this.

34:16.137 --> 34:18.889
He's on his way.

34:38.743 --> 34:40.661
(exclaiming)

34:46.417 --> 34:48.168
There he is!
Here he comes.

34:48.252 --> 34:49.754
Police!
(screaming)

34:51.547 --> 34:52.507
Don't move! Police!
I'll take that.

34:52.590 --> 34:54.842
MAN:
No, no, no.
He's got it, he's got it.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.470
You're expecting
someone else maybe?

34:58.638 --> 35:00.473
Get him out of here.

35:00.556 --> 35:04.227
Who the hell is that?

35:04.310 --> 35:05.186
That's Pia Toledo's
bodyguard or lover.

35:05.269 --> 35:08.022
She sent him?

35:08.105 --> 35:10.107
No. No, apparently
she didn't have any idea.

35:11.234 --> 35:13.694
He wanted to avenge her?

35:13.778 --> 35:15.363
Such a stupid reason
for Allen to die.

35:15.446 --> 35:18.032
Yeah.

35:18.115 --> 35:20.493
Look, if you want,
we can give you an escort home.

35:21.452 --> 35:22.620
Guys, get onstage.

35:22.703 --> 35:24.539
My whole life,

35:24.622 --> 35:26.666
people have paid
for my mistakes.

35:28.751 --> 35:30.503
But no one ever died for one.

35:30.586 --> 35:31.546
I'm dedicating
the show tonight to Allen.

35:31.629 --> 35:32.588
You're still going on?

35:32.672 --> 35:33.548
Hell, yeah.

35:33.631 --> 35:35.591
And you two
are coming out with me

35:35.675 --> 35:38.135
so I can thank you
in front of everybody.

35:38.219 --> 35:40.221
Well, we-we...
No, we appreciate that,

35:40.304 --> 35:41.681
but we can't.
We have paperwork to do.

35:41.764 --> 35:43.349
You sure?

35:43.432 --> 35:44.934
You could help me open up.

35:45.017 --> 35:46.811
I know you know all the lyrics.

35:46.894 --> 35:49.272
(Danny sighs)

35:51.190 --> 35:53.234
In another lifetime.

36:00.658 --> 36:01.742
(cheering and applause)

36:01.826 --> 36:04.245
So, when do you leave?

36:04.328 --> 36:06.622
Day after tomorrow.
I hear the rent's

36:06.706 --> 36:07.623
even higher in San Francisco
than it is here.

36:07.707 --> 36:08.749
Is that even possible?

36:08.833 --> 36:10.835
What are you
complaining about?

36:10.918 --> 36:12.795
You got the hookup
from your CO.

36:12.879 --> 36:14.547
NICKY:
I'll be living in one of
the economically challenged

36:14.630 --> 36:16.090
neighborhoods
I'm helping, so rent

36:16.173 --> 36:17.717
will be manageable.

36:17.800 --> 36:19.302
You know which one yet?

36:19.385 --> 36:20.928
The start-up's putting me up
while I sort out

36:21.012 --> 36:22.638
a place to stay.
ERIN:
I'm hoping it will be

36:22.722 --> 36:24.098
near public transportation.

36:24.181 --> 36:25.474
I would think so.
DANNY:
Which is what,

36:25.558 --> 36:27.768
exactly, in San Francisco?

36:27.852 --> 36:29.437
One of those, uh,
Rice-A-Roni cable cars?

36:29.520 --> 36:31.814
Do you have any friends there?
NICKY:
Uh,

36:31.898 --> 36:33.274
a couple from school,
but it'll be an adjustment.

36:33.357 --> 36:35.610
A big adjustment.

36:35.693 --> 36:36.485
I mean, you have to
find a new bagel shop.

36:36.569 --> 36:38.237
New pizza parlor.

36:38.321 --> 36:39.488
And bacon, egg and cheese
on a roll.

36:39.572 --> 36:40.615
HENRY:
I hear they close

36:40.698 --> 36:41.782
the bars early, too.

36:41.866 --> 36:43.075
Hey.
HENRY:
What?

36:43.159 --> 36:44.285
I was 22 once.

36:44.368 --> 36:46.287
(chuckles)
NICKY:
Okay.

36:46.370 --> 36:48.289
I get it, guys.
It's not New York.

36:48.372 --> 36:51.292
Nicky, I think what
everybody's trying to say

36:51.375 --> 36:52.835
is congratulations
on landing a new job.

36:52.919 --> 36:54.462
(overlapping agreement)

36:54.545 --> 36:57.131
No small feat these days.

36:57.214 --> 36:59.592
Well, thank you.
What if you don't like it?

36:59.675 --> 37:01.135
Then she will move back and
live with her dear old mom

37:01.219 --> 37:02.803
till the end of her days.
(Frank chuckles)

37:02.887 --> 37:03.804
You'd hate that
more than I would.

37:03.888 --> 37:04.805
True.

37:04.889 --> 37:05.973
HENRY:
Hey, Francis and I

37:06.057 --> 37:07.266
get along fine.

37:08.267 --> 37:09.602
Don't we?

37:09.685 --> 37:10.645
Kinda.

37:10.728 --> 37:13.814
(chuckles)
JANKO:
So, now that it's

37:13.898 --> 37:16.025
actually happening,
are you more nervous or excited?

37:16.108 --> 37:17.276
Honestly, it's hard to say.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.528
When I was in Boston,
I'd walk the streets

37:19.612 --> 37:20.613
to keep my mind and my feet
moving. Made me less homesick.

37:20.696 --> 37:21.614
HENRY:
I didn't miss New York

37:21.697 --> 37:24.492
'cause I never left,

37:24.575 --> 37:25.284
which is the secret to
my long and happy life.

37:25.368 --> 37:26.994
(chuckles)
Right.

37:27.078 --> 37:29.664
DANNY:
I missed New York so much,

37:29.747 --> 37:31.791
we had Nathan's hot dogs
shipped all the way to Fallujah.

37:31.874 --> 37:33.334
I think, for me,
it was calling my mom

37:33.417 --> 37:35.836
maybe every other day.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.171
Oh. Subtle.

37:37.254 --> 37:39.215
A stack of Mad magazines
at summer camp.

37:39.298 --> 37:40.341
What?
You got bored sometimes.

37:40.424 --> 37:41.175
Baseball.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.135
Baseball?
Yeah, I always

37:43.219 --> 37:45.137
traveled with two gloves
and a ball.

37:45.221 --> 37:47.890
It was easy to scare up
a game of catch.

37:47.974 --> 37:50.017
Took me home to my own backyard.

37:50.101 --> 37:53.646
What about you, Nicky?

37:53.729 --> 37:55.106
Is organizing a Sunday potluck
too on the nose?

37:55.189 --> 37:57.692
FRANK:
Hmm.

37:57.775 --> 37:59.402
Wow, I sense the makings
of a new tradition.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.035
(laughter)
DANNY:
Yeah.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.870
Sure, come right in.

38:09.954 --> 38:11.580
Since day one, you've been
protecting Officer Brooks,

38:11.664 --> 38:12.999
giving her special treatment.
Be very careful

38:13.082 --> 38:14.250
what you say next, Reagan.

38:14.333 --> 38:15.501
You got a relationship with her,
one that's not

38:15.584 --> 38:17.920
strictly professional.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.216
More careful than that.

38:22.299 --> 38:23.884
You went to IAB?

38:23.968 --> 38:27.179
No.

38:27.263 --> 38:28.222
Look, Reagan,
I'm not sure what it is

38:28.306 --> 38:32.893
you think
you know...

38:32.977 --> 38:35.396
Officer Brooks's father was FDNY
and died on 9/11.

38:35.479 --> 38:37.773
He was also the best man
at your wedding.

38:37.857 --> 38:40.443
You conducted
your own investigation?

38:45.906 --> 38:49.577
I was afraid I'd turn up
something worse.

38:49.660 --> 38:52.913
Sarah came up rough,
made a few bad decisions.

38:52.997 --> 38:56.584
I convinced her to take the
test, figured it would--

38:56.667 --> 38:59.754
hoped that it would help
straighten her out.

38:59.837 --> 39:02.465
Then you requested she be
put here, under your command.

39:02.548 --> 39:05.009
Under yours. I put her
on your squad because I knew

39:07.136 --> 39:09.055
you would be the best person
to get through to her.

39:09.138 --> 39:11.599
Why haven't you let me
do my job?

39:11.682 --> 39:14.935
If you're too harsh,
she'll cut and run.

39:15.019 --> 39:16.103
Then we drag her back here
kicking and screaming.

39:16.187 --> 39:17.813
But you're doing her no favors,

39:17.897 --> 39:20.941
letting her off the hook
every time.

39:21.025 --> 39:24.111
I guess I've got
a soft spot for her.

39:26.072 --> 39:28.115
All the more reason I should be
the one making the decisions.

39:30.159 --> 39:32.036
You're really growing
into those stripes, aren't you?

39:33.037 --> 39:34.830
That mean I can get back
to work?

39:49.261 --> 39:51.305
Why are you still standing here?

39:53.682 --> 39:56.852
I miss anything?

39:56.936 --> 39:58.479
I've always been able to count
on hockey to distract me.

39:58.562 --> 40:00.523
Moves so fast.

40:03.025 --> 40:04.777
Meaning it's not
working tonight?

40:06.070 --> 40:07.655
Did you try to talk him
out of it?

40:07.738 --> 40:10.991
I'm the guy who started
his troubles.

40:11.075 --> 40:13.327
You can't be both arsonist
and firefighter.

40:13.410 --> 40:15.621
Notifying IAB was
the right thing to do. You...

40:15.704 --> 40:17.498
The complaints had
to be investigated.

40:17.581 --> 40:18.999
I'm not so sure.

40:19.083 --> 40:22.586
It was by the book, Dad.

40:23.587 --> 40:25.297
What good's the book
if no one else is reading it?

40:25.381 --> 40:28.676
You don't mean that.

40:28.759 --> 40:30.010
Your doubts about your boss
could've been passed up to IAB,

40:30.094 --> 40:32.054
by the book.

40:33.931 --> 40:37.184
But you didn't.

40:37.935 --> 40:40.521
Because you see what I see.

40:40.604 --> 40:42.523
No, I just took a breath.

40:42.606 --> 40:46.193
No.

40:46.277 --> 40:49.363
You hit the brakes
because you're a smart guy

40:49.446 --> 40:52.741
in a careless time
when certain accusations,

40:52.825 --> 40:57.163
by their very nature,
carry a penalty

40:59.498 --> 41:00.875
the instant that accusation
is even whispered.

41:00.958 --> 41:04.044
Whether it has merit or not

41:07.089 --> 41:10.050
becomes utterly
beside the point.

41:10.134 --> 41:13.012
I'm glad I hit the brakes.

41:13.095 --> 41:17.099
So am I,

41:17.183 --> 41:21.061
and so is your boss,
I'm sure, but...

41:21.145 --> 41:24.231
going forward,
how the hell do we do our jobs?

41:24.315 --> 41:27.067
By learning from our mistakes,
like always.

41:27.151 --> 41:28.527
You remember The Man Who Shot
Liberty Valance?

41:28.611 --> 41:29.904
Old movie?

41:29.987 --> 41:32.489
Yeah.

41:32.573 --> 41:34.617
This reporter's about to go
to press with a story

41:34.700 --> 41:38.078
based largely on bunk,

41:38.162 --> 41:42.416
and this other guy,
he challenges him.

41:42.500 --> 41:47.504
So the reporter says,
"This is the West, sir.

41:48.505 --> 41:50.841
When the legend becomes fact,
print the legend."

41:51.842 --> 41:54.970
So, like, forget
about the real facts?

41:56.013 --> 41:57.097
We got a version
of that going on.

41:58.849 --> 42:01.477
So, what do we do?

42:03.562 --> 42:06.106
(sighs)
I don't know.

42:06.190 --> 42:09.109
I don't know.

42:11.153 --> 42:17.952
But I do care.

42:18.035 --> 42:21.038
