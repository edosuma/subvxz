10:00.601 --> 10:02.567
There's your "dun-dun-dun"
moment.

10:02.569 --> 10:04.803
I got stuck
on the dedication.

10:05.705 --> 10:07.072
I got nothing left.

10:07.074 --> 10:10.208
Looks like it's all over
for Jocelyn Elderwood.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.576
You paid
for a master class,

10:11.578 --> 10:13.778
but all you got is
front-row seats

10:13.780 --> 10:17.082
to the death of an old man's
female persona.

10:17.084 --> 10:19.150
I would not have
bid on that.

10:22.121 --> 10:25.590
That was Len Stein
the Jewish lawyer.

10:25.592 --> 10:27.559
The good news is, no more
bedtimes around here.

10:27.561 --> 10:30.562
Cleveland was the only one
enforcing that stupid rule.

10:30.564 --> 10:33.765
The bad news is, he'll
probably be in jail for
14 years

10:33.767 --> 10:36.067
if he behaves himself.

10:36.069 --> 10:38.236
And you know he won't.

10:38.238 --> 10:39.404
(door slams open)

10:39.406 --> 10:42.040
Cleveland didn't kill no one.

10:42.908 --> 10:44.075
I heard what happened,

10:44.077 --> 10:45.777
and Cleveland's a lot
of things:

10:45.779 --> 10:48.747
a goof, a sap, a
wienie, a dork,

10:48.749 --> 10:51.349
a dill weed, and a
worthless fat-ass,

10:51.351 --> 10:52.584
but he ain't
no killer.

10:52.586 --> 10:53.785
Well, how do you know?

10:53.787 --> 10:57.288
I don't, but Jocelyn Elderwood
has a hunch,

10:57.290 --> 11:00.759
and a lady's intuition
is always right.

11:00.761 --> 11:04.629
You know, sometimes, Grandpa,
I wish we could just
play catch.

11:04.631 --> 11:06.131
No time for catch.

11:06.133 --> 11:08.533
Cracking this case will put
Jocelyn Elderwood back

11:08.535 --> 11:10.635
on top of the Amazon
self-publish list.

11:10.637 --> 11:13.605
And I'm gonna need my two
star pupils to help me.

11:13.607 --> 11:15.306
We're his star pupils!

11:15.308 --> 11:16.841
Oof, oof,
oof, oof!

11:19.311 --> 11:22.814
To prove Cleveland's innocent,
we're gonna have to prove--

11:22.816 --> 11:24.949
and follow me here--
he didn't do it.

11:24.951 --> 11:26.785
Cleveland can only
throw 30 miles per hour

11:26.787 --> 11:30.188
because he has
what I call "wuss arm."

11:30.190 --> 11:31.656
To simulate his throw,

11:31.658 --> 11:34.025
I'm gonna throw this egg
left-handed at Kendra.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.628
I was told there'd be soup.

11:39.965 --> 11:41.800
Still alive.

11:41.802 --> 11:43.635
See? Cleveland couldn't
have killed her.

11:43.637 --> 11:44.836
Thanks, Kendra.

11:44.838 --> 11:46.671
No problemo.

11:46.673 --> 11:48.640
Thanks for the egg, dude.

11:48.642 --> 11:49.808
(egg shell crunching)

11:49.810 --> 11:51.810
She eating the shell.

11:51.812 --> 11:52.811
She don't care.

11:52.813 --> 11:55.580
So if Dad didn't
kill her, who did?

11:55.582 --> 11:57.716
We'll find out at the morgue
when we talk to Lydia.

11:57.718 --> 12:00.852
(dramatic music plays)
Because corpses talk
the loudest.

12:00.854 --> 12:03.588
Ooh, get that down--
I can end a scene on that.

12:03.590 --> 12:05.890
As long as no one says
anything else after it.

12:10.863 --> 12:12.197
Howzit, brah?

12:12.199 --> 12:13.698
Wait, where do
I know you from?

12:13.700 --> 12:16.935
Oh-ho-ho, I was
on your jury.

12:17.903 --> 12:20.739
Ah, slept through
the first half of that trial,

12:20.741 --> 12:24.109
but when I woke up, I wanted
to prove I was
paying attention.

12:24.111 --> 12:25.944
Might as well
convict somebody.

12:25.946 --> 12:28.513
Persuaded every last
one of them.

12:28.515 --> 12:31.449
Wow, that was 19 years ago.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.885
Man, you have missed a lot.

12:33.887 --> 12:35.754
<i>Gilmore Girls </i> got cancelled.

12:35.756 --> 12:37.922
There was a show called
the  <i>Gilmore Girls.</i>

12:37.924 --> 12:40.592
What, do you collect Vaseline?

12:40.594 --> 12:41.993
(laughs) Oh.

12:47.433 --> 12:50.735
The gentleman in my cell
is not a good person.

12:50.737 --> 12:53.271
If it wasn't for the kindness
of the Aryans,

12:53.273 --> 12:55.106
I don't know what I'd do.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.741
They're a godsend.

12:56.743 --> 13:00.211
Them and... your love.

13:00.213 --> 13:03.214
(crying):
I don't tell you this
often enough, Donna,

13:03.216 --> 13:06.151
but you are a beautiful woman

13:06.153 --> 13:08.953
and a wonderful wife.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.054
What?

13:10.756 --> 13:12.624
Help, Donna!

13:12.626 --> 13:14.859
The mammaries--
let me see the mammaries!

13:17.897 --> 13:19.898
Damn!

13:19.900 --> 13:22.400
Check out the ass
on that ladybug.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.068
Oh, yeah.
Interesting.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.909
Boy, a lot can go wrong
in life, huh?

13:30.911 --> 13:32.911
Lydia was a dear
friend of mine.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.479
Could I see the body?

13:34.481 --> 13:36.147
Absolutely not.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.715
Whoops.

13:38.751 --> 13:40.952
My distressed-suede
ankle boots.

13:40.954 --> 13:43.655
All right, that's how
chapter nine ends.

13:43.657 --> 13:44.756
Now for chapter ten,

13:44.758 --> 13:46.758
"The Morgue, the Merrier."

13:46.760 --> 13:48.960
(laughs)
Nice.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.995
Now, let's creep.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.837
Mmm, oh, good,
it's P, B and J.

13:58.839 --> 14:01.506
I was worried that
the "J" might be blood.

14:01.508 --> 14:05.076
And yet you
took the chance.

14:07.479 --> 14:09.047
Aah! Death!

14:09.049 --> 14:11.783
Quiet, Rallo,
her soul is sleeping.

14:11.785 --> 14:12.951
There is

14:12.953 --> 14:14.786
a small bump
where the egg hit her.

14:14.788 --> 14:17.689
But look at all this
skin irritation.

14:19.491 --> 14:20.859
Just as I thought--

14:20.861 --> 14:23.194
her throat's swollen shut
from anaphylactic shock.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.864
She died of an allergic
reaction to something
in the soup

14:25.866 --> 14:28.967
she was eating before
the egg even hit her.

blow into your mouth.

14:39.813 --> 14:42.747
Oh, he's that kind of grandpa.

14:42.749 --> 14:45.550
I need Junior's super palate
to place this flavor.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.552
Okay, just
don't goose me.

15:01.534 --> 15:02.901
I know!

15:02.903 --> 15:04.535
Fern Stapleton.

15:04.537 --> 15:08.006
She had that bland peanut
brittle at the silent auction.

We found traces

Smash-and-grab--
classic Chris Brown.

16:06.066 --> 16:07.565
I thought about that.

16:07.567 --> 16:10.635
But this was a window,
not a lady's face. Hey,

16:10.637 --> 16:12.904
these footprints are
from Skechers Shape-Ups.

16:12.906 --> 16:16.107
Fern's off the hook--
these are too big to be
lady footprints.

16:16.109 --> 16:18.443
But what guy would
wear Shape-Ups?

16:18.445 --> 16:20.445

There it is.

16:59.719 --> 17:00.985
That's preposterous!

17:00.987 --> 17:02.353
I didn't kill my wife!

17:02.355 --> 17:03.788
I loved her...

17:03.790 --> 17:06.190

our heterosexual intercourse.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.193
Look! He's wearing Shape-Ups!

17:09.195 --> 17:11.996
He left Shape-Up footprints
in Fern Stapleton's house

17:11.998 --> 17:14.799
when he broke in
to steal her peanut oil,

17:14.801 --> 17:16.167
which he used

17:16.169 --> 17:18.136
to poison-kill Lydia!

17:18.138 --> 17:20.371
Those could have been
anyone's Shape-Up prints.

17:20.373 --> 17:23.007
Besides, I'm as allergic

18:44.257 --> 18:45.990
That's not a rash

18:45.992 --> 18:47.125
Those are hickeys.

And when your
"little buddy"
gave you CPR,

18:54.567 --> 18:56.134
I figured that's
what he was doing--

18:56.136 --> 18:58.469
make it look like you had
an allergic reaction.

hickey right now!

19:00.773 --> 19:02.106
Shut up, Cookie!

19:02.108 --> 19:04.108

Mr. Coroner here

19:06.112 --> 19:08.846

suede ankle boots.

Awful expensive shoes
on a coroner's salary.

19:12.018 --> 19:14.585

clues in this mystery.

butter sandwich.

I know, because I had some.

19:21.261 --> 19:23.161

19:23.163 --> 19:24.929
When he was
giving you CPR,

he would've got peanut
residue in your mouth,

peanuts you  <i>supposedly </i> can't
be in the same room with!

19:30.803 --> 19:33.137
(chuckling)

19:33.139 --> 19:37.508
Oh. There is
just  <i>one </i> more thing.

19:37.510 --> 19:40.311
How did you get the oil
into her soup?

19:40.313 --> 19:42.813
A spoon.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.148
(shocked groans)

19:44.150 --> 19:47.118
And, boys,  <i>there's</i>
<i>the title of our book:</i>

19:47.120 --> 19:51.122
<i>Waiter,</i>
<i>There's a Murder in My Soup.</i>

19:51.124 --> 19:53.357
Thus ends your
master class.

19:53.359 --> 19:55.326
Oh...!

19:55.328 --> 19:58.129
Yes! Yes! Yes!

19:58.131 --> 20:00.631
(quiet music playing)

20:00.633 --> 20:03.134
What a night it's been!

20:03.136 --> 20:04.135
Who done it?

20:04.137 --> 20:07.038
You done it,
Freight Train,
once again.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.472
(applause, whooping)
Well, you know what?

20:08.474 --> 20:10.308
I had some help with this one.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.176
Rallo, Cleveland Jr....

20:12.178 --> 20:13.911
(applause, cheering, whooping)

20:13.913 --> 20:17.048
...and real-life events which
led to the false imprisonment

20:17.050 --> 20:18.816
of my son Cleveland.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.351
Where is Cleveland?

20:20.353 --> 20:22.220
Still in jail!

20:22.222 --> 20:24.922
Now,  <i>that's </i> something
I should've noticed.

20:27.359 --> 20:30.228
CLEVELAND:
♪ I see trees of green

20:30.230 --> 20:33.164
♪ Red roses, too

20:33.166 --> 20:35.733
♪ I see 'em bloom

20:35.735 --> 20:38.336
♪ For me and you

20:38.338 --> 20:41.372
♪ And I think to myself

20:41.374 --> 20:44.008
(crying):
♪ What a wonderful world...

20:44.010 --> 20:46.143
Cleveland jr.:
Daddy! Daddy!

20:47.579 --> 20:49.880
First of all,
you look really pretty.

20:49.882 --> 20:52.216
Second of all,
you're free!

20:52.218 --> 20:53.684
I'm, uh...

20:53.686 --> 20:55.620
never gonna be the same.
