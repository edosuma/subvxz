01:35.190 --> 01:37.420
It says we're
still back at the Burger Hut.

01:37.430 --> 01:39.160
Told you
we should've brought a map.

01:39.160 --> 01:42.430
It's not my fault
Roman forgot the GPS.

01:42.430 --> 01:45.100
But you remembered to bring your
stupid sound gear though, right?

01:45.100 --> 01:45.870
Shh.

01:49.540 --> 01:51.270
Oh, it works now!

01:54.840 --> 01:56.140
What is it?

01:56.150 --> 01:59.150
The drama never stops.

01:59.150 --> 02:01.880
Would you quit texting your
girlfriend and tell me where we are?

02:01.880 --> 02:04.820
I would but the signal
keeps dropping.

02:04.820 --> 02:06.490
Why don't you open that?

02:06.490 --> 02:08.820
See if there's anything in
there that might help us.

02:12.660 --> 02:14.330
Just for backup!

02:14.330 --> 02:15.360
No trust.

02:17.670 --> 02:19.270
Thanks, navigator.

02:24.910 --> 02:26.570
Are we there yet?

02:26.580 --> 02:28.410
I will turn this car around.

02:30.380 --> 02:32.510
- Hey, what's that?
- What?

02:32.520 --> 02:35.780
How many times do I have
to tell you, you need glasses?

02:35.780 --> 02:38.350
The same number of times that I've
told you I'm not wearing glasses.

02:38.350 --> 02:40.150
Girls in glasses are sexy.

02:41.360 --> 02:43.390
Thanks, Roman.

02:43.390 --> 02:45.790
So is stubble
that never seems to grow out.

03:09.750 --> 03:11.490
We have reception, people.

03:16.620 --> 03:18.230
This place is weird.

03:42.950 --> 03:44.720
Sam,
what are you doing?

03:44.720 --> 03:45.990
Give me a minute.

03:49.760 --> 03:52.530
Hey, look what I found.

03:52.530 --> 03:55.530
Oh. I didn't know
you still had that.

03:55.530 --> 03:58.670
Yeah, you know my parents, they
never throw anything out, so...

03:58.670 --> 04:04.270
Well, this is good. You'll have something
to remember me by while I'm gone.

04:04.270 --> 04:06.270
Maybe you should hang on to it.
I mean, you did make it.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.570
I made it for you.

04:16.920 --> 04:18.320
Very stylish.

04:20.589 --> 04:23.390
You sure your parents are
okay with you not graduating?

04:23.390 --> 04:26.260
I am graduating. I'm just
pushing it back a semester.

04:26.260 --> 04:30.300
Right. I... I'm just saying you
picked a bad time to travel.

04:30.300 --> 04:32.570
Especially, with people you've just met.
I mean, you barely know them.

04:32.570 --> 04:34.740
I'm only gonna be gone
for six months.

04:34.740 --> 04:37.370
And you know what I'm gonna
do as soon as I get back?

04:37.370 --> 04:39.270
I'm gonna call my best friend.

04:41.710 --> 04:44.040
You wanna go, explore with me?

04:44.050 --> 04:46.350
Are you gonna do this
the whole trip?

04:46.350 --> 04:49.520
Well, I've gotta build
my sound library.

04:49.520 --> 04:51.650
I'll pass. I think I'm gonna
stick with the group.

04:51.650 --> 04:53.720
Come on. Live a little.

04:53.720 --> 04:54.960
That's the point.

05:20.950 --> 05:22.620
Is this a private party?

05:23.450 --> 05:25.050
Where is he going?

05:25.050 --> 05:28.460
Oh! You know to record
animal sex sounds.

05:28.460 --> 05:29.820
For his personal use.

05:33.430 --> 05:34.660
Everything okay?

05:35.100 --> 05:36.560
Yeah, I just

05:38.000 --> 05:39.770
wanted to talk to the lawyer.

05:39.770 --> 05:41.470
Oh.

05:41.470 --> 05:42.900
Try him again
before we leave.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.600
I've been trying for two days.

05:44.610 --> 05:46.370
All I get is a busy signal.

05:48.040 --> 05:50.780
How are we getting
into the house?

05:50.780 --> 05:53.050
I guess, there's a caretaker
or something.

05:53.050 --> 05:54.550
He'll be there.

05:59.720 --> 06:02.390
Man! I wish somebody
would give me a house.

06:03.860 --> 06:04.860
Yeah.

06:05.760 --> 06:07.030
It's pretty cool.

06:09.030 --> 06:10.530
What do your parents
think of it?

06:10.530 --> 06:12.100
You know, the Harrises.

06:12.100 --> 06:13.900
The Harrises are my parents.

06:16.670 --> 06:18.770
- I haven't told them yet.
- What!

06:18.770 --> 06:19.770
Why not?

06:20.680 --> 06:21.880
I don't know.

06:24.510 --> 06:27.650
I've asked them about my real family
before but they always got upset.

06:28.980 --> 06:31.590
I guess, I didn't want
to hurt their feelings?

06:34.920 --> 06:36.890
Well, who did you
get the house from?

06:38.590 --> 06:39.860
An aunt, I think?

06:41.660 --> 06:43.560
I wanted to talk
to the lawyer more.

06:45.930 --> 06:46.700
Are you fucking
kidding me?

06:49.540 --> 06:51.470
- Boys.
- What do you think is going on?

06:52.570 --> 06:55.610
I think the name's Jessica.

06:55.610 --> 06:57.940
Seriously? He can't
take a vacation?

06:57.950 --> 06:59.680
What does she think
he's gonna do?

06:59.680 --> 07:03.450
I don't know. I try to stay
out of Mark's love life.

07:03.450 --> 07:05.620
Except for that time when
you were Mark's love life.

07:33.550 --> 07:34.980
Radio tower feedback.

10:05.270 --> 10:07.630
Great! Signal's gone.

10:07.640 --> 10:10.100
Well, at least
we have the map.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.810
- It's not that.
- What is it?

10:12.910 --> 10:14.670
She dumped me.

10:14.680 --> 10:15.610
Aw!

10:16.810 --> 10:18.080
I'm so sorry.

10:20.380 --> 10:22.180
It's probably for the best.

10:22.180 --> 10:24.990
Maybe you're right, Sam.

10:24.990 --> 10:27.750
I'm getting sick of fighting
with her all the time anyway.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.890
Hey, we're gonna
have a great time.

10:29.890 --> 10:33.160
Uh, maybe you guys will get back
together when you get back to school.

10:34.130 --> 10:35.160
Or not.

11:01.690 --> 11:03.020
Well, this is it.

11:04.390 --> 11:06.390
So,
what do we do now?

11:06.400 --> 11:08.290
I don't know.
He's supposed to be here.

11:10.330 --> 11:11.770
Oh, shit!

11:17.440 --> 11:18.410
Sam?

11:21.040 --> 11:22.680
Uh, you must be Sam.

11:24.180 --> 11:25.910
I am. Nice to meet you.

11:27.880 --> 11:28.880
Eric.

11:30.990 --> 11:33.350
Mark, Caitlin, Roman.

11:35.690 --> 11:37.920
Okay.

11:37.930 --> 11:40.790
Let me just get this gate open
for you, and I'll follow you in.

12:38.020 --> 12:39.450
What do you think
the house will look like?

12:39.450 --> 12:41.890
It's going
to be beautiful, Sam!

12:41.890 --> 12:42.890
Uh...

12:46.060 --> 12:49.860
It's not exactly the four-bedroom,
two-bath estate we were hoping for.

12:49.870 --> 12:52.130
Well, at least
there's a gross barn,

12:52.130 --> 12:54.830
probably infested with rats,
right next door.

12:54.840 --> 12:58.070
You're always looking on
the bright side of things, Roman.

12:58.070 --> 13:00.410
Is that really it?

13:00.410 --> 13:02.080
Hmm. The driveway
keeps going up,

13:02.080 --> 13:03.980
so maybe
that's where he lives.

13:05.250 --> 13:07.250
- Who?
- Glenn.

13:07.250 --> 13:09.150
His name's Eric,
retard.

13:09.150 --> 13:11.790
He just told us his name.

13:11.790 --> 13:13.990
I guess.
He looks like a Glenn to me.

13:16.360 --> 13:17.460
Here we go.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.300
This is great, Sam!

13:30.200 --> 13:31.200
Pool!

13:32.470 --> 13:34.210
- It's a pool, buddy.
- I don't swim.

13:35.180 --> 13:36.440
It's five feet deep.

13:45.250 --> 13:47.090
Oh, let me show you
around a little.

13:49.860 --> 13:52.060
Oh, man!

13:52.060 --> 13:55.330
There's gonna be some serious late-night
skinny-dipping going on in this pool!

13:58.470 --> 13:59.500
Oh, fuck!

14:01.900 --> 14:03.400
Over there's the well.

14:04.840 --> 14:07.310
What, we have to get
our water from a well?

14:07.310 --> 14:10.580
No, you have running water
that comes from a well.

14:10.580 --> 14:13.510
Sorry, they're city boys.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.920
They're dumbasses
is what she means to say.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.980
Oh, okay.

14:17.990 --> 14:19.020
Hey, you don't
agree with that.

14:20.350 --> 14:21.550
Hey, what's in here?

14:21.560 --> 14:23.990
It's just a bunch of junk.

14:23.990 --> 14:25.490
What about the barn we passed?

14:25.490 --> 14:28.630
It might be best if you
stay out until I'm done.

14:28.630 --> 14:32.330
Everything is covered in dust
and crawling with black widows.

14:32.330 --> 14:34.500
Well, I'm convinced.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.270
I'll just get the power
turned back on for you.

14:44.450 --> 14:46.280
It's just right
around here.

14:55.390 --> 14:57.920
Hey, somebody tell us
when the lights come on!

15:29.260 --> 15:30.590
- Anything?
- Not yet!

15:39.430 --> 15:40.530
Hello?

15:56.050 --> 15:57.450
- Oh!
- Oh!

16:00.960 --> 16:03.120
So, where are
we gonna have the fire?

16:03.120 --> 16:04.520
Can we have a fire?

16:04.530 --> 16:05.960
Like a bonfire?

16:05.960 --> 16:07.490
No, like a house fire.

16:08.960 --> 16:10.400
Insurance.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.430
No, a bonfire.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.470
Don't listen to that idiot.

16:14.470 --> 16:16.170
Hey, where do we sleep?

16:16.170 --> 16:17.740
Uh, there's two bedrooms
in the back.

16:17.740 --> 16:19.410
I'm gonna take the couch.

16:20.640 --> 16:22.510
Well, I'll take
one of the bedrooms.

16:22.510 --> 16:24.680
Who's gonna join me?

16:24.680 --> 16:27.280
Sorry, big boy,
you are on your own.

16:27.280 --> 16:30.120
Sam and I are taking
the master bedroom.

16:30.120 --> 16:32.050
Oh, that's all we're gonna
be thinking about tonight.

16:32.050 --> 16:33.220
Right, Eric?

16:34.020 --> 16:35.520
Uh...

16:35.520 --> 16:37.690
There's a fire pit in the
woods behind the pool.

16:39.760 --> 16:42.660
Thanks so much
for showing us around.

16:42.660 --> 16:45.160
I'm sure
I'll have other questions.

16:45.170 --> 16:49.140
Yeah, anything you need.
My place is right down there.

16:49.140 --> 16:52.110
Hey! Do you wanna
hang out with us tonight?

16:52.110 --> 16:53.340
- Really?
- Really?

16:55.210 --> 16:57.240
Yeah. You should
totally hang out with us.

17:01.250 --> 17:02.550
Uh, okay.

17:13.630 --> 17:15.190
Are you sure
you don't want a drink?

17:15.200 --> 17:17.030
We have plenty.

17:17.030 --> 17:18.560
Oh, no.
I don't... I don't drink.

17:20.200 --> 17:24.170
I can't stand those.
They taste like cough syrup.

17:24.170 --> 17:26.640
They get a pretty
bad wrap, but...

17:26.640 --> 17:29.480
These are pretty good. A buddy in
my platoon got me hooked on 'em.

17:29.480 --> 17:31.680
You're in the military?

17:31.680 --> 17:34.180
So was my, my dad.

17:35.550 --> 17:37.420
Yeah. I was in the army.

17:39.290 --> 17:42.320
I haven't been able to kick
the bad habits yet. I'm trying though.

17:42.320 --> 17:45.430
- Do those work?
- No, not at all.

17:45.430 --> 17:48.130
I don't know, man.
It just sounds like a bunch of noise.

17:48.130 --> 17:50.330
Well, uh, it is
technically a bunch of noise

17:50.330 --> 17:53.400
but you mix it together
and it's a song.

17:53.400 --> 17:57.100
- Let me just show this part.
- Don't get too excited.

17:57.110 --> 17:59.070
Remember the time when you peed
your pants in the talent show?

17:59.070 --> 18:01.110
- Oh, in sixth grade.
- Eighth grade.

18:04.850 --> 18:06.480
I didn't have anywhere to stay
when I got back

18:06.480 --> 18:10.420
so your aunt offered me
the caretaker job,

18:10.420 --> 18:14.220
to just stay on the property until the new
owner decides what they wanna do with it.

18:16.820 --> 18:18.720
What are you gonna do with it?

18:20.130 --> 18:21.230
Hey, Eric.

18:22.800 --> 18:25.160
Are there any weird stories
from around here?

18:25.170 --> 18:27.300
You know, cults or meth
rings or something?

18:27.300 --> 18:29.700
Yeah! I mean, every town
has got a creepy story.

18:29.700 --> 18:31.470
It's a little cliche, right?

18:31.470 --> 18:34.310
Not every small town
has to be strange.

18:34.310 --> 18:36.140
Did nobody die around here?

18:36.140 --> 18:38.180
Sam's aunt, she died here.

18:39.750 --> 18:42.820
Not died, murdered.
You know what we mean.

18:42.820 --> 18:44.820
Wait. Where did she die?

18:46.750 --> 18:48.890
Don't tell me
it was in my room.

18:48.890 --> 18:51.760
I found her in a rocking chair
in the middle of the day.

18:53.430 --> 18:55.500
Just like that? Peaceful?

18:56.830 --> 18:58.630
Yeah. Peaceful.

19:00.830 --> 19:03.440
So everything in there
belongs to a dead lady?

19:03.440 --> 19:04.700
I wake up
in the middle of the night,

19:04.710 --> 19:05.810
and there's an old lady
standing over me,

19:05.810 --> 19:08.570
I'm going
to freak the fuck out.

19:08.580 --> 19:11.410
Maybe you'll wake up to the
creaking of the rocking chair!

19:12.150 --> 19:13.880
Oh!

19:13.880 --> 19:15.850
Yeah.
Maybe you'll hear creaking.

19:16.880 --> 19:19.190
You'll get out of bed.

19:19.190 --> 19:22.920
Come down the hall, being
careful not to make a sound.

19:22.920 --> 19:24.890
And you'll come
around the corner, slowly.

19:25.930 --> 19:27.190
Slowly.

19:29.230 --> 19:31.460
And what do you see?

19:31.470 --> 19:34.470
Roman, eyes closed,
lost in the moment,

19:34.470 --> 19:37.700
just stroking away!

19:37.710 --> 19:42.410
You'll scream a blood-curdling scream
that wakes the whole house up!

19:42.410 --> 19:45.440
And that's when Roman comes
all over the coffee table.

19:45.450 --> 19:47.780
Shut the fuck up.

19:47.780 --> 19:49.850
Nothing wrong
with self-satisfaction, man.

19:49.850 --> 19:51.720
I guess you would know, Mark.

19:54.690 --> 19:56.560
How long did
my aunt live here?

19:58.290 --> 20:00.530
Millie? She was here
a while, 15 years.

20:02.230 --> 20:03.860
She moved in
after your parents left.

20:04.730 --> 20:05.870
My parents?

20:06.830 --> 20:07.930
You didn't know that?

20:07.940 --> 20:10.600
Where was Sam?

20:10.610 --> 20:12.440
She was here. She lived
here until she was five.

20:12.440 --> 20:13.910
Holy shit! That's crazy.

20:14.740 --> 20:15.980
I was born here?

20:17.640 --> 20:19.610
And who were they,
Sam's parents?

20:20.910 --> 20:22.780
James and Ellen Sader.

20:23.720 --> 20:25.520
Your last name's Sader?

20:25.520 --> 20:26.650
It's Harris.

20:28.520 --> 20:31.560
- I know, I just mean...
- Everything all right, Sam?

20:31.560 --> 20:34.530
Yeah, I'm fine. It's just...
It's a lot to take in.

20:39.800 --> 20:42.240
I saw that name Sader
on the map.

20:42.240 --> 20:44.540
Sader Ridge.

20:44.540 --> 20:46.840
Sam's great-grandfather used to
own most of the land around here.

20:46.840 --> 20:49.510
- Huh.
- Wow.

20:49.510 --> 20:51.240
You know a lot
about the family?

20:52.510 --> 20:54.310
I guess.
I grew up around here.

20:55.580 --> 20:57.580
You lived near here?

20:57.590 --> 21:00.720
Yeah. Next property
over, five miles down.

21:00.720 --> 21:03.520
Sam and I used to play
in these woods.

21:03.520 --> 21:04.920
We knew each other?

21:04.930 --> 21:06.960
No way. Really?

21:06.960 --> 21:09.560
I don't remember any of this.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.030
Oh, you were just a kid.

21:15.670 --> 21:18.340
Well,
I'm gonna turn in.

21:18.340 --> 21:19.940
Still on military time.

21:25.750 --> 21:27.410
Sure you're okay, Sam?

21:27.980 --> 21:30.620
Yeah. I'm fine. Just...

21:34.050 --> 21:36.390
Was he that weird
when he was a kid?

21:36.390 --> 21:38.660
I don't remember anything
before the Harrises.

22:05.050 --> 22:08.020
The light of God
surrounds me.

22:08.020 --> 22:10.390
The love of God enfolds me.

22:16.730 --> 22:18.660
The power of God protects me.

22:19.430 --> 22:21.570
Caitlin?

22:21.570 --> 22:24.340
The presence of God
watches over me.

22:26.040 --> 22:31.040
Wherever I am, God is.
And wherever God is, all is well.

22:52.630 --> 22:54.000
It's about time.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.740
Hey! I was just gonna come
wake you up.

22:56.740 --> 22:58.900
Wow! You guys have been really
productive this morning.

22:58.910 --> 23:01.110
I'm impressed.

23:01.110 --> 23:04.080
Yeah, we gotta get a move on.
Eric said your property was pretty big.

23:04.080 --> 23:05.540
My property.

23:11.620 --> 23:12.720
- What's that?
- Ow!

23:12.720 --> 23:14.490
Sorry.

23:14.490 --> 23:15.760
God, I don't know.

23:17.420 --> 23:19.130
Oh, man, you were drunk!

23:21.530 --> 23:22.800
Oh. Hey, Eric.

23:23.700 --> 23:24.930
You can come in.

23:26.830 --> 23:28.400
Morning.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.170
What were you
doing out there, spying on us?

23:30.170 --> 23:31.570
Mark!

23:31.570 --> 23:32.870
The door was open.

23:33.870 --> 23:35.880
What's going on, Eric?

23:35.880 --> 23:38.110
Nothing. Just wanted to see how
everyone's first night went.

23:38.110 --> 23:39.480
Everything was fine.

23:39.480 --> 23:42.180
The bed was super comfy.

23:42.180 --> 23:43.620
How was
the couch, Roman?

23:43.620 --> 23:44.580
I like the couch.

23:44.590 --> 23:45.850
These are great!

23:45.850 --> 23:47.090
My specialty.

23:55.500 --> 23:58.800
I'd offer you some food but you know I
just thought it'd be the four of us.

23:58.800 --> 24:00.100
Oh, it's okay.

24:01.800 --> 24:03.070
What are you packing for?

24:03.070 --> 24:05.570
We're going on a hike.

24:05.570 --> 24:07.440
We're gonna check out Sam's
property, look for Bigfoot.

24:07.440 --> 24:09.110
You know, the ushe.

24:09.110 --> 24:10.840
See if you recognize anything?

24:10.850 --> 24:12.510
Maybe.

24:12.510 --> 24:13.950
I can show you around
if you like.

24:13.950 --> 24:16.580
I know this property
like the back of my hand.

24:16.580 --> 24:19.020
You know, the hot water
didn't come on all night.

24:19.020 --> 24:21.720
We were hoping that
could get fixed here soon.

24:21.720 --> 24:25.560
Cold shower isn't no fun unless there's
a pretty lady in there with you.

24:25.560 --> 24:28.160
Yeah, I can...
I can take a look at it while you're out.

24:33.570 --> 24:35.470
He was just trying to be nice.

24:41.210 --> 24:44.740
What's the big deal?

24:44.750 --> 24:47.710
She's just going through a lot right now.
Don't take it personally.

24:57.920 --> 24:59.830
Hey!

24:59.830 --> 25:02.160
How are you dealing
with the Jessica situation?

25:02.160 --> 25:04.100
I was trying not to think about it.
Thanks a lot, Sam.

25:04.100 --> 25:07.200
Aw! You poor baby!

25:07.200 --> 25:11.700
You're so brave and stoic
to deal with it like you have.

25:11.710 --> 25:14.240
You can't just break up with
somebody, if you've put in six months?

25:14.240 --> 25:15.980
Six months is not that long.

25:15.980 --> 25:17.980
I hate to tell you.

25:38.270 --> 25:40.230
Well, this is it.

25:41.070 --> 25:42.770
All you own ends here.

25:44.270 --> 25:45.670
Wow!

25:46.610 --> 25:48.940
Let's go check it out!

25:48.940 --> 25:51.040
- That's not her property.
- So?

25:51.050 --> 25:52.780
So it's not a good idea.
What if someone's house is over there?

25:52.780 --> 25:53.950
It'll be fine.

25:53.950 --> 25:55.780
Caitlin, no!

25:55.780 --> 25:57.180
What's the big deal?

25:58.180 --> 25:59.890
Check it out.

25:59.890 --> 26:03.190
Well, aren't we feeling
adventurous all of a sudden.

26:03.190 --> 26:05.260
Look, don't worry, Mark.
I'll protect you.

26:08.700 --> 26:11.060
Great! You hear that, girls?

26:11.070 --> 26:14.100
If something goes wrong, Roman will
make sure to record it all for posterity.

26:34.620 --> 26:35.250
Jerk!

26:45.900 --> 26:47.870
Hey, if you get
shotgun blasted in the face

26:47.870 --> 26:49.300
let us know so the
pretty ones can escape, okay?

26:53.910 --> 26:56.880
Come on, Mark. I'm sorry the trip
didn't get off to a better start.

26:57.780 --> 26:59.080
Nah, it's cool.

27:00.180 --> 27:01.810
We were probably gonna
breakup anyway.

27:01.820 --> 27:03.280
Nothing happened? Did it?

27:07.020 --> 27:08.390
What's that supposed to mean?

27:08.390 --> 27:10.020
I was just asking.

27:10.020 --> 27:12.260
Is this about
when you and I broke up?

27:12.260 --> 27:13.990
Do you really gotta keep
bringing that up?

27:14.000 --> 27:17.300
Mark, I wasn't
implying anything.

27:17.300 --> 27:20.300
Yes, I went to the classes and I talked
to the counselor. You know all this.

27:20.300 --> 27:23.700
All right. I'm sorry
I brought it up.

27:30.040 --> 27:32.380
Hey, listen, I'm sorry.

27:35.850 --> 27:37.120
Yeah, me, too.

27:38.750 --> 27:40.320
- Hey, guys!
- Come on.

27:40.320 --> 27:42.690
You gotta come
check this out!

27:51.360 --> 27:53.230
- Wow.
- Isn't it gorgeous?

27:55.740 --> 27:57.440
I could kiss you
right now, Roman.

28:39.480 --> 28:41.480
Uh, I am not spending the
night out here in the dark.

28:41.480 --> 28:43.380
You baby.

28:43.380 --> 28:45.720
- What's that sound?
- What are you afraid of?

28:45.720 --> 28:48.250
Yeah, what,
werewolves, vampires?

28:48.260 --> 28:51.960
Uh, no. Ticks and bears, you
know, shit that actually exists.

28:51.960 --> 28:54.830
Oh, I forgot ticks exist.

28:54.830 --> 28:58.160
Well, you know, the trick is to not stop
and let something eat you. Come on!

29:03.000 --> 29:04.040
Oh, fuck!

29:25.530 --> 29:26.930
- Oh. - What happened? Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

29:26.930 --> 29:28.030
Cow's shit!

29:30.230 --> 29:32.300
You don't get that
in the city.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.170
Mark?

29:39.970 --> 29:41.540
I don't hear anything.

29:41.540 --> 29:43.780
Mark!

29:44.980 --> 29:46.380
- Mark!
- Did you hear that?

29:58.930 --> 29:59.990
There!

30:02.160 --> 30:03.360
That asshole!

30:31.860 --> 30:33.490
- What's going on?
- I lost him.

30:34.860 --> 30:37.130
I looked back
and then he was gone.

30:37.130 --> 30:39.260
He's just
fucking with us.

30:39.270 --> 30:42.230
He was really freaked out. He's
never admit it but he was.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.240
Okay. Well,
if he was freaked out,

30:44.240 --> 30:45.840
then he probably just
went back to the house.

30:45.840 --> 30:47.210
What if he's not?

30:47.210 --> 30:49.110
What if he's lost?

30:49.110 --> 30:50.940
Mark isn't the type
to get lost.

30:52.380 --> 30:54.610
I'm sure
he's just back at the house.

31:08.130 --> 31:10.030
Who left the door open?

31:10.860 --> 31:12.000
Mark?

31:14.200 --> 31:15.300
Is he here?

31:18.470 --> 31:20.340
- Did you even look?
- Nope.

31:20.340 --> 31:22.570
He's not here.

31:22.580 --> 31:25.010
We haven't checked
everywhere yet.

31:25.010 --> 31:26.880
Come on, Mark.
This isn't funny.

31:26.880 --> 31:28.580
What's wrong with you?

31:28.580 --> 31:31.450
Look, Mark's a big boy, okay?

31:31.450 --> 31:34.390
Right now, he feels like a big,
stupid pussy because he got scared.

31:34.390 --> 31:37.520
So, he's just taking his time
coming back. That's it.

31:37.520 --> 31:39.930
There's nothing
to worry about.

31:39.930 --> 31:41.630
We all saw him fucking around and
running ahead of us out there.

31:41.630 --> 31:43.900
What if that wasn't him
by the fence?

31:45.930 --> 31:48.430
Didn't you guys get a weird
feeling from that place?

31:48.440 --> 31:51.370
I don't know. I mean, it was... It was weird.
But who would be out there?

31:51.370 --> 31:52.570
What's up?

31:54.370 --> 31:57.010
I fixed the hot water.

31:57.010 --> 31:58.380
We can't find Mark.
Have you seen him?

31:58.380 --> 32:00.080
Where was he last?

32:00.080 --> 32:01.950
In the woods,
by the fence.

32:01.950 --> 32:04.080
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna find him

32:04.080 --> 32:06.920
- I'm going with you.
- Caitlin!

32:06.920 --> 32:08.950
What if he missed the house coming back?
We should check out front.

32:08.960 --> 32:11.120
No! He's out there
fucking around,

32:11.130 --> 32:13.260
getting everyone all worked up
for no reason!

32:13.260 --> 32:14.930
The last thing we should do
is go get lost in the dark

32:14.930 --> 32:17.060
just because of
this shit he's pulling!

32:35.650 --> 32:37.180
I don't remember a thing.

32:37.180 --> 32:38.220
What?

32:41.120 --> 32:42.720
I don't remember this place.

32:44.560 --> 32:47.290
It was a long time ago.

32:47.290 --> 32:49.090
- Do you remember when you were five?
- Mmm.

32:56.700 --> 32:58.600
Who puts their five-year-old
kid up for adoption?

33:01.310 --> 33:02.740
Situations change.

33:04.040 --> 33:05.440
It's not unheard of.

33:07.350 --> 33:09.180
I wonder where my aunt died.

33:11.280 --> 33:13.420
- Right there.
- Really?

33:13.420 --> 33:14.990
How do you know?

33:17.360 --> 33:19.420
Oh. That's creepy.

33:20.230 --> 33:21.260
Yeah.

33:28.570 --> 33:30.270
Wonder if they're
gonna get back.

33:31.170 --> 33:32.570
She'll be fine.

34:11.210 --> 34:12.280
Roman?

35:09.370 --> 35:10.470
Roman?

35:12.410 --> 35:14.240
What are you doing out here?

35:16.210 --> 35:17.310
Roman?

35:18.880 --> 35:20.780
I can't go in there...
Anymore.

35:23.220 --> 35:24.480
What do you mean?

35:26.290 --> 35:28.190
I just can't do it.

35:29.660 --> 35:31.120
I can't do it.

35:33.430 --> 35:34.690
That poor girl.

35:38.600 --> 35:40.530
She's driving me insane.

35:40.530 --> 35:41.530
What?

35:42.640 --> 35:44.540
Are you talking about Caitlin?

35:47.270 --> 35:48.610
You can talk to me.

35:50.210 --> 35:51.540
It's gonna be okay.

35:53.250 --> 35:55.580
What's gonna
happen to her?

36:01.620 --> 36:03.590
She's not gonna
be gone forever.

36:03.590 --> 36:05.460
It's... It's just six months.

36:10.260 --> 36:12.860
I won't do it! I won't do it!

36:12.870 --> 36:14.770
I won't do it! I won't do it!

36:14.770 --> 36:17.600
- Stop it!
- I won't do it! I won't do it!

36:17.600 --> 36:18.800
- Stop!
- Sam!

36:19.740 --> 36:21.210
Guys, come here!

36:33.550 --> 36:34.750
What's wrong?

36:36.790 --> 36:39.220
What?

36:39.230 --> 36:40.890
I told you,
it got dark and I just...

36:42.430 --> 36:43.660
Everything looks
the same out there.

36:43.660 --> 36:46.430
No, I know
you're fucking with us.

36:46.430 --> 36:49.970
Dude, hanging out in the woods in the middle
of the night is not my idea of a good time.

36:49.970 --> 36:51.370
- Drink this.
- Thanks.

36:54.770 --> 36:57.480
Your little stunt
put Caitlin in danger.

36:57.480 --> 37:01.210
What if we all went looking for you?
And we all got lost?

37:01.220 --> 37:03.520
Why do you think I'm always trying
to fuck with you and this group?

37:03.520 --> 37:06.590
Because you are always trying
to fuck with me and this group!

37:06.590 --> 37:07.950
I didn't have
a flashlight...

37:07.960 --> 37:08.950
So, um...

37:11.460 --> 37:13.390
What were you
yelling about out there?

37:13.390 --> 37:16.490
- Nothing, I guess.
- Are you sure?

37:16.500 --> 37:18.460
You accidentally
tried to be funny?

37:18.470 --> 37:20.500
Maybe I'm just tired.

37:20.500 --> 37:21.770
I'm going to bed.

37:26.410 --> 37:29.240
Well, uh, I think
I'm gonna crash, too.

37:30.940 --> 37:32.380
'Night, boys.

37:41.650 --> 37:44.360
I guess, I'd better
be getting back.

37:44.360 --> 37:45.960
Hey, thanks for helping out.

37:47.530 --> 37:49.560
It was a good thing
I was here.

37:49.560 --> 37:51.430
I would've found my way back.

37:52.800 --> 37:53.800
Sure.

37:56.440 --> 37:57.570
I would have.

38:04.380 --> 38:06.480
The light
of God surrounds me.

38:07.610 --> 38:09.380
The love of God enfolds me.

38:10.750 --> 38:12.620
The power of God protects me.

38:14.690 --> 38:16.520
The presence of God
watches over me.

38:18.960 --> 38:21.290
Wherever I am, God is.

38:24.060 --> 38:26.430
And wherever God is,
all is well.

39:06.970 --> 39:08.610
Feeling better?

39:09.080 --> 39:10.480
Much. Thanks.

39:11.680 --> 39:12.740
Coffee?

39:14.510 --> 39:16.980
Oh, no. I already had
an energy drink this morning.

39:18.080 --> 39:20.090
What's going on?

39:20.090 --> 39:22.450
Oh, just seeing what you guys are up to.
Am I intruding?

39:23.120 --> 39:24.890
Don't worry about Mark.

39:24.890 --> 39:27.830
He can be that way
with people sometimes.

39:29.560 --> 39:31.360
No, it's fine. It's just...

39:34.730 --> 39:36.900
It's nice, having people
around here again.

39:39.940 --> 39:41.670
It's been so quiet since...

39:44.580 --> 39:46.480
Come on, get out of the rain.

40:05.060 --> 40:07.400
You were close with my aunt?

40:07.400 --> 40:10.470
Yeah, I was taking care
of her before she passed.

40:10.470 --> 40:12.940
I used to visit her now and
again when I was on leave.

40:13.940 --> 40:16.980
She used to send me these...

40:16.980 --> 40:20.010
These little care packages
when I was in Afghanistan.

40:20.010 --> 40:21.810
Sounds like a sweet lady.

40:21.820 --> 40:23.520
You would've liked her.

40:26.590 --> 40:28.490
Oh, it was crazy
when I found her.

40:31.190 --> 40:32.820
She seemed okay
the day before.

40:34.060 --> 40:35.760
Guess it was her time.

40:45.200 --> 40:46.910
What were my parents like?

40:47.940 --> 40:49.210
Mmm.

40:50.740 --> 40:52.440
They were parents, I guess.

41:01.520 --> 41:03.460
What about you and me?

41:04.190 --> 41:06.520
You and me?

41:06.530 --> 41:08.690
When we were kids,
what were we like?

41:10.530 --> 41:13.000
It was good.

41:13.000 --> 41:16.070
We used to run around this whole property.
This was our world.

41:17.200 --> 41:18.470
Yeah?

41:20.740 --> 41:23.610
We used to play back by the fence.
We'd play hide and seek.

41:23.610 --> 41:27.210
We'd jump over, look at Sader
Ridge on the other side.

41:27.210 --> 41:29.780
- That's Sader Ridge back there?
- Yeah. You saw it?

41:29.780 --> 41:30.980
It was beautiful.

41:34.020 --> 41:37.020
We used to look out and imagine
hiking all the way to the mountains.

41:41.990 --> 41:43.760
You were my best friend.

41:48.970 --> 41:50.270
So, what happened?

41:58.240 --> 42:00.010
So, what's the plan today?

42:02.580 --> 42:06.120
I don't know. Have fun.
It's a vacation, right?

42:08.290 --> 42:10.190
Well, I got some work to do
around here.

42:13.160 --> 42:15.730
Thanks for telling me that stuff.
I like hearing about it.

42:17.660 --> 42:19.660
Sorry I don't remember...

42:19.670 --> 42:20.270
Anything.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Way better than keys.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.200
Fuck keys!

43:32.200 --> 43:35.610
Wow. You really know how to
show a girl a good time.

43:47.650 --> 43:48.620
Ha!

43:52.660 --> 43:54.690
You can have it.

43:54.690 --> 43:55.990
There are cooler things
in here, anyway.

44:16.980 --> 44:20.390
...over here!

44:20.390 --> 44:23.150
- Please!
- You'll do what you're told!

44:23.160 --> 44:25.320
- No, stop, please!
- Shut up!

44:30.100 --> 44:32.430
Get off her!

44:32.430 --> 44:33.430
- Fuck!
- What are you doing?

44:40.370 --> 44:41.870
What the fuck?

44:45.180 --> 44:47.050
I thought...
I thought he was...

44:47.050 --> 44:48.350
You thought he was what?

44:49.920 --> 44:51.880
Oh, my fuck. That hurt.

44:51.890 --> 44:53.180
What happened?

44:53.190 --> 44:54.950
Wasn't he hurting you?

44:54.950 --> 44:56.750
What?

44:56.760 --> 44:58.460
What're you talking about?

44:58.460 --> 45:00.690
- What were you doing in there?
- We were just checking it out.

45:01.390 --> 45:03.090
I'm so sorry, Mark.

45:04.730 --> 45:05.260
It's probably just
a minor fracture.

45:08.030 --> 45:09.800
What about you?
Are you okay?

45:11.140 --> 45:12.240
I'm fine.

45:19.240 --> 45:19.840
Hey, you should
see this.

45:26.120 --> 45:27.850
Your new car!

45:28.850 --> 45:30.990
Looks kind of gross.

45:30.990 --> 45:33.830
Save your judgments until you
see the spacious interior.

45:39.730 --> 45:41.400
- See?
- Hmm.

45:41.400 --> 45:43.270
It's not so bad
on the inside.

45:43.270 --> 45:44.200
Guess not.

45:55.150 --> 45:56.750
Hey, how do you like
your new fixer-upper?

46:02.860 --> 46:04.820
Do you think it's your family?

46:04.820 --> 46:07.020
I don't know. I guess so.

46:09.930 --> 46:10.860
What're you doing in here?

46:14.030 --> 46:16.030
We're hanging out in Sam's barn.
What're you doing here?

46:18.770 --> 46:19.540
You all really
shouldn't be in here.

46:29.210 --> 46:30.780
What's the big deal?

46:41.390 --> 46:43.260
Everything okay?

46:43.260 --> 46:45.960
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I got nervous.

46:45.970 --> 46:48.400
The support beams in here
are kind of weak.

46:48.400 --> 46:50.800
I've been meaning
to take care of it.

46:50.800 --> 46:53.870
I thought you were worried
about us getting bitten by spiders.

47:29.040 --> 47:31.080
What did I really see
back there?

47:31.080 --> 47:34.610
We were just fooling around.

47:34.610 --> 47:38.180
Look, I don't care what the two of you do.
It's none of my business.

47:38.180 --> 47:41.490
And you've got to do your best
to keep it under control.

47:41.490 --> 47:44.860
This again?
Why're you always blaming me for that.

47:44.860 --> 47:47.860
- That wasn't even my fault.
- Mark!

47:47.860 --> 47:50.030
The guy was being a sleazebag
and I stuck up for you.

47:50.030 --> 47:52.530
You put him in a hospital.

47:52.530 --> 47:55.270
Yeah, I did.
And I paid for it.

47:55.270 --> 47:58.570
I never touched you.
I would never touch Caitlin.

47:58.570 --> 48:01.170
If you can't trust me,
then what the fuck am I doing here?

48:03.640 --> 48:06.180
I asked you to come out here
because we're friends.

48:06.180 --> 48:07.980
Then start acting like it.

48:28.400 --> 48:29.500
Mmm.

48:30.900 --> 48:32.140
This is delicious.

48:32.140 --> 48:34.070
It's my specialty.

48:34.070 --> 48:36.070
You said that about your eggs.

48:36.080 --> 48:36.640
Maybe I'm just good at shit,
okay?

48:38.010 --> 48:39.110
We all know that's not true.

48:41.980 --> 48:44.380
Yeah, I've seen his GPA.

48:44.380 --> 48:46.520
Hey, geniuses don't usually
get the best grades.

48:46.520 --> 48:49.090
Oh, it's okay, Mark.
You can get by on just being pretty.

49:07.670 --> 49:08.940
This is a private room.

49:10.110 --> 49:11.080
Door wasn't shut.

49:13.210 --> 49:15.050
Are you okay?

49:15.050 --> 49:16.350
Yeah, fine, just...

49:17.980 --> 49:20.020
Mark's getting on my nerves.

49:20.020 --> 49:23.090
Sorry.

49:23.090 --> 49:25.520
I mean, he would break up with his
girlfriend on this trip, wouldn't he?

49:25.530 --> 49:28.190
It wasn't his fault.

49:28.190 --> 49:30.230
You just can't get
so upset about it.

49:32.230 --> 49:34.500
And what happened
on the porch,

49:34.500 --> 49:36.670
that's between
you and me, okay?

49:36.670 --> 49:38.470
What're you talking about?

49:38.470 --> 49:41.510
The crying and...

49:41.510 --> 49:44.380
Look, I'm upset,
I'm not hysterical, okay?

49:44.380 --> 49:46.340
Can we just stop talking about it?
It's giving me a headache.

49:48.710 --> 49:50.580
Let's just try to have
a good time.

49:53.520 --> 49:56.190
Are... Are you having
a good time?

49:58.020 --> 50:00.160
I mean, is any of this
what you expected?

50:00.160 --> 50:02.060
I don't know what I expected.

50:04.760 --> 50:07.500
It's kind of weird to think
you grew up here.

50:07.500 --> 50:09.500
Yeah.

50:09.500 --> 50:11.670
You think that's you
in any of those pictures.

50:13.540 --> 50:15.170
Roman!

50:15.170 --> 50:17.140
Yeah?

50:17.140 --> 50:19.780
You remember when
Mrs. Michael set fire to her garage?

50:19.780 --> 50:22.250
- Yeah.
- Come tell that story. I can't do it.

50:23.150 --> 50:24.180
We'll talk later.

50:53.410 --> 50:54.580
Lisa?

51:11.230 --> 51:13.130
Don't.

51:15.170 --> 51:18.200
You brought this down
on my house.

51:18.200 --> 51:20.270
Who's there?

51:20.270 --> 51:21.210
Caitlin!

51:23.380 --> 51:25.440
I won't have you walking with
the doctors in my house.

51:27.250 --> 51:28.410
Please, no!

51:31.250 --> 51:32.220
Stop!

51:40.330 --> 51:43.460
Go to your room if you know what's
good for you or you're next.

51:45.700 --> 51:47.500
Daddy, please!

51:58.540 --> 51:59.740
Roman!

52:08.690 --> 52:10.490
What happened?

52:10.490 --> 52:12.590
Something's wrong
with Sam.

52:12.590 --> 52:14.530
Let's get her into the room.

52:36.820 --> 52:39.780
Well, she's sleeping soundly.

52:41.250 --> 52:42.650
And how is she?

52:42.660 --> 52:43.520
I don't know, Roman.

52:44.620 --> 52:46.460
What the fuck happened?

52:46.460 --> 52:47.290
You saw as much as I did.

52:49.230 --> 52:52.260
Her forehead's cold
but it's like she has a fever.

52:52.270 --> 52:53.900
What do you mean?

52:55.730 --> 52:58.570
She seems weak
and she won't talk

52:58.570 --> 53:01.470
and it's like she's having
bad dreams.

53:01.470 --> 53:03.910
She keeps mentioning some
prayer she heard me saying

53:03.910 --> 53:07.380
but I don't know what
she's talking about.

53:07.380 --> 53:10.450
I haven't been
to church in years.

53:10.450 --> 53:11.380
Should we take her
to see a doctor?

53:13.290 --> 53:14.850
Is there a doctor in town?

53:15.850 --> 53:18.260
Uh, no.

53:20.230 --> 53:21.530
How can there not be
a doctor in this town?

53:22.560 --> 53:24.430
Not a real one.

53:24.430 --> 53:26.630
The nearest doctor's
three hours away.

53:28.730 --> 53:31.400
I don't know, guys. Maybe we
should just let her sleep.

53:32.640 --> 53:33.800
We should probably take her
to see a doctor.

53:34.770 --> 53:36.840
She' probably just exhausted.

53:36.840 --> 53:40.540
Yeah, I mean, she's been
swamped at school lately.

53:40.550 --> 53:43.380
We probably should've waited until
after finals to come out here.

53:44.250 --> 53:46.650
Just let her sleep.

53:46.650 --> 53:50.250
If she wakes up and wants to
go home early, we'll leave.

53:50.260 --> 53:52.360
- What about the house?
- This place?

53:52.360 --> 53:54.330
She can figure
that out at home.

53:54.330 --> 53:56.360
Probably just gonna
sell it anyway.

54:01.770 --> 54:03.400
Fucking weirdo.

54:54.420 --> 54:56.320
What're you doing in here?

54:56.320 --> 54:57.450
I'm checking in on you.

54:59.520 --> 55:01.330
You were in a pretty
bad way last night.

55:08.530 --> 55:09.600
Eric...

55:13.640 --> 55:14.670
I saw...

55:16.910 --> 55:17.880
What did you see?

55:22.950 --> 55:24.850
It was so real.

55:28.820 --> 55:30.050
There's no way.

55:31.420 --> 55:32.720
Mark...

55:36.090 --> 55:37.590
Mark was...

55:42.870 --> 55:44.340
He was a monster.

55:47.710 --> 55:49.470
I don't know
what you saw, Sam,

55:51.580 --> 55:53.380
but it's real.

55:53.380 --> 55:55.480
Don't doubt that.

55:55.480 --> 55:58.480
Eric, if you know something about
this, I need you to tell me.

56:04.690 --> 56:06.860
Everything changed
when your parents died.

56:11.060 --> 56:12.530
My parents are dead.

56:18.740 --> 56:21.910
It's no wonder you don't
remember any of it.

56:21.910 --> 56:24.640
All that heavy shit happening
to someone that young.

56:26.810 --> 56:29.650
What're you talking about?

56:29.650 --> 56:31.550
Sam, your father
wasn't a good man.

56:33.450 --> 56:36.590
A lot of folks around here,
they had it out for him.

56:36.590 --> 56:38.520
They didn't like his beliefs,

56:42.490 --> 56:44.560
or the way
that he raised his children.

56:49.130 --> 56:50.130
Children?

56:59.440 --> 57:00.710
- Sam.
- Not again!

57:01.180 --> 57:03.550
Sam!

57:03.550 --> 57:06.650
You're fucking drunk?
It's 7:00 in the morning.

57:06.650 --> 57:09.920
Still... We're still drunk.
We haven't been to bed yet.

57:09.920 --> 57:11.720
- Shut the fuck up, Mark.
- Oh!

57:11.720 --> 57:16.030
- Guys.
- And Caitlin! What are you thinking?

57:16.030 --> 57:19.530
What're you doing? This is Mark.
He's an asshole. Is this what you really want?

57:19.530 --> 57:21.000
Hey, man. Sticks and stones.

57:21.000 --> 57:23.500
Guys.

57:23.500 --> 57:25.870
For years, I defended you when
people talked shit behind your back.

57:25.870 --> 57:27.100
I defended you!

57:30.180 --> 57:31.040
Maybe they were right.

57:33.110 --> 57:35.650
Maybe you are
just a fucking slut.

57:35.650 --> 57:38.150
Oh, that's real nice, Roman.
Is that your mom's necklace?

57:38.150 --> 57:39.150
Fuck you!

57:40.890 --> 57:42.590
Stop it. Leave him alone.

57:42.590 --> 57:43.450
What?

57:47.060 --> 57:48.990
Are you fucking kidding me?

57:48.990 --> 57:50.060
I didn't even touch him!

57:57.900 --> 57:59.100
What a dick!

58:01.140 --> 58:02.710
Tell me about it.

58:06.480 --> 58:09.480
Why does he have to make me feel
like shit for living my own life?

58:12.950 --> 58:15.790
I mean, who wouldn't want to
go away for six months and...

58:22.090 --> 58:23.860
Roman's your best friend.

58:28.270 --> 58:29.770
He'll get over it.

58:32.670 --> 58:35.710
Just give him some time.

58:38.110 --> 58:41.110
Oh, my God, my head hurts.

58:50.220 --> 58:51.220
Roman!

59:07.270 --> 59:10.070
Such an asshole.
Fuck, fuck!

59:13.610 --> 59:15.550
Shit. What the fuck, man?

59:17.880 --> 59:19.050
Where are you going?

59:19.050 --> 59:20.150
Out.

59:22.890 --> 59:26.120
I just... I got to get out for
a little while, that's all.

59:26.130 --> 59:28.290
You going to town?

59:28.290 --> 59:30.060
Going to see
the fucking sights.

59:31.760 --> 59:33.560
You're gonna need the key.

59:34.570 --> 59:35.630
What key?

59:36.100 --> 59:38.040
Gate's locked.

59:38.040 --> 59:39.800
Well, can you unlock it?

59:40.840 --> 59:41.840
Yeah.

59:42.870 --> 59:45.210
That's what the key is for.

59:45.210 --> 59:47.180
So, what's the problem?

59:47.180 --> 59:49.050
Just wanted you to know.

59:50.050 --> 59:52.320
Thanks. Can I have the key?

59:57.090 --> 59:58.890
It's stuck to my chain.
I'll just ride down with you and unlock it.

59:58.890 --> 01:00:01.220
Fine, whatever.

01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:03.590
Fuck, this place is so far
from anything.

01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:48.770
Caitlin?

01:02:02.110 --> 01:02:03.250
Hey, Sam.

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:08.350
How're you doing?

01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:12.720
I feel terrible.

01:02:16.030 --> 01:02:17.360
Is Roman back?

01:02:21.370 --> 01:02:22.870
How're you feeling?

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.280
Have you seen Eric?

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:35.450
Sam, I haven't left the house.

01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:38.880
Right.

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:43.850
I'm sorry about this morning.

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:47.290
It's not your fault.

01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:52.100
Just be careful.

01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:54.260
What does that mean?

01:03:01.070 --> 01:03:04.980
When Mark and I were dating,
there was one night we went to a bar,

01:03:04.980 --> 01:03:08.480
and there was a guy there
who kept hitting on me.

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:12.920
I told him to screw off, but that
wasn't good enough for him or for Mark.

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:20.990
Eventually he tried to grab me,
and Mark started hitting him.

01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:23.830
Sam, Mark told me
all this already.

01:03:23.830 --> 01:03:26.230
And frankly, I don't care.

01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:27.430
The guy was being an asshole.

01:03:28.370 --> 01:03:30.370
Mark was just defending you.

01:03:30.370 --> 01:03:33.140
Caitlin, he hit him
until he passed out.

01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:34.070
He put the guy in a hospital.

01:03:38.580 --> 01:03:40.410
What're you two talking about?

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:43.180
Just girl talk.

01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:50.020
I should probably let
the two of you sleep.

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:52.060
Sam.

01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:16.950
Where did you come from?

01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:19.280
Why are you afraid of me?

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:20.380
I only want
what's best for you.

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:33.030
What were you doing
in my room?

01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:35.870
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:39.240
You burned me
with your cigarette.

01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:41.870
Does that sound like something a man
would do to his little girl?

01:04:42.570 --> 01:04:44.110
I don't believe it.

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:49.210
No one else would either.

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:53.880
Don't you touch me.

01:04:56.450 --> 01:04:57.990
She's sick, you know.

01:04:57.990 --> 01:04:59.920
What?

01:04:59.930 --> 01:05:01.020
And getting worse every day.

01:05:03.230 --> 01:05:05.060
Won't be long now
before she's with the Lord.

01:05:05.530 --> 01:05:06.460
Who?

01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:08.130
Caitlin?

01:05:12.300 --> 01:05:14.340
Stay away from her.

01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:17.210
"But I suffer
not a woman to teach,

01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:19.310
"nor to usurp authority
over the man,

01:05:21.650 --> 01:05:22.580
"but to be in silence."

01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:39.930
Eric!

01:06:00.250 --> 01:06:01.320
Eric!

01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:07.490
You were following me?

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:12.660
Eric, something's
happening to me.

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:18.030
This used to be our place.

01:06:19.070 --> 01:06:20.570
We built a fort here.

01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:22.640
Eric, please!

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:24.510
Sam, listen...

01:06:26.310 --> 01:06:28.040
We used to play here
all the time.

01:06:28.050 --> 01:06:31.350
We'd play house or doctor.

01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:36.420
Okay, that sounds bad.

01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:38.250
But don't worry, it was
just playing the doctor.

01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:41.490
We'd fix a broken arm
or an upset stomach.

01:06:41.490 --> 01:06:45.260
We weren't a gynecologist
or anything.

01:06:45.260 --> 01:06:47.000
I'd hate to think you were
taking advantage of me.

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:52.040
No.

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:54.270
No, I would never do that.
Not then, not now.

01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:00.140
Eric, I'm not the same person
you remember.

01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:03.410
No, you are. You're...

01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:05.750
You're the same beautiful girl that
made all the problems of the world

01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:07.420
disappear with her smile.

01:07:12.490 --> 01:07:15.430
I feel like there's so much
I'm not remembering.

01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:23.500
Things are coming back
but they don't make any sense.

01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:28.200
I don't know what's real.

01:07:29.470 --> 01:07:30.370
What's in my head.

01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:34.180
It might be hard.

01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:41.180
You have to remember, Sam,
not just what you went through,

01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:43.520
you have to understand
what I went through.

01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:48.790
After everything that happened with
your family, and you were taken away,

01:07:48.790 --> 01:07:50.730
I had nothing to keep
me grounded, nothing.

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:54.800
I bounced around
different foster homes

01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:58.500
and when I was old enough,
I joined the army.

01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:00.770
I thought I would get
some direction in my life.

01:08:03.370 --> 01:08:08.240
But seeing all that death, it just
made me realize more and more

01:08:08.250 --> 01:08:09.650
that the only place I wanted
to be was with you again.

01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:17.750
I'm sorry
for what happened to you.

01:08:23.859 --> 01:08:26.300
It's getting late.

01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:28.300
You should get back
to the house.

01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:30.200
Why can't you just
tell me what you know?

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.310
May be different if you just
let it back in.

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:40.140
This isn't a stroll
down memory lane for me.

01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:44.510
There's something
seriously wrong here.

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:48.250
Eric!

01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:26.359
Eric!

01:09:43.870 --> 01:09:45.910
I can't find Sam.

01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:48.180
Didn't she say
she was looking for Eric?

01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:53.720
She's probably off
reminiscing somewhere.

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:54.720
Mark?

01:10:07.330 --> 01:10:08.430
Eric!

01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:17.940
Eric!

01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:48.370
Oh, God.

01:11:20.570 --> 01:11:22.270
I can't do it anymore.

01:11:23.810 --> 01:11:25.410
I... I won't.

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:29.550
She's so tiny.

01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:41.420
Maybe... Maybe God doesn't
want her to go yet.

01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:44.660
Maybe he's not
calling them to Heaven.

01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:47.060
Maybe...

01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:48.930
Maybe I could've saved Mom.

01:11:48.930 --> 01:11:50.500
No, no!

01:11:55.970 --> 01:11:56.970
And now, I'm gonna go to hell.

01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:03.410
Anything's better than this.

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:07.450
No!

01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:10.520
No!

01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:11.650
No!

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:20.030
Sam?

01:12:23.370 --> 01:12:24.670
Where is she?

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.940
I can't see
anything out here.

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:30.410
What if she's lost?

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:34.080
Come on.
Let's go get a flash light.

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:36.010
Mark! Sam's out here.

01:12:37.410 --> 01:12:38.780
What if she comes back?

01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:41.480
Suit yourself.

01:13:26.930 --> 01:13:28.060
Oh, my God.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.840
Oh, my God. Oh, My God.

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:35.710
Oh, God.

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:40.140
What the fuck
are you doing?

01:13:40.150 --> 01:13:43.480
This is where Sam was born.

01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:45.180
This is where she belongs. I won't
let anyone get in the way of that.

01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:47.580
Let go of her.

01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:48.750
Dig.

01:13:50.050 --> 01:13:51.850
- What?
- Dig!

01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:53.620
Mark.

01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:58.030
If you wanna help Sam, dig.

01:13:58.030 --> 01:13:59.100
There.

01:14:01.670 --> 01:14:02.830
Caitlin!

01:14:10.970 --> 01:14:12.110
Caitlin?

01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:14.140
Caitlin.

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:19.880
Caitlin.

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:22.620
"The presence of God watches over me.

01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:24.690
- "Wherever I am, God is.
- Caitlin.

01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:27.990
"And wherever God is,
all is well."

01:14:45.710 --> 01:14:48.080
Don't worry, Samantha.
It'll all be over soon.

01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:09.000
What is this?

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.000
Sam's family.

01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:12.900
You sick fuck.

01:15:16.970 --> 01:15:18.270
Caitlin!

01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:23.180
What I do, I do for Sam.

01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:28.950
No!

01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:40.100
<i> "By the power</i>
<i>of the Lord,</i>

01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:42.670
<i>"Accept him</i>
<i>and your wounds will heal."</i>

01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:46.170
<i> I don't feel good.</i>

01:15:46.170 --> 01:15:49.070
<i>I don't wanna end up like Mom.</i>
<i>She's really sick.</i>

01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:51.840
<i>She needs to go</i>
<i>to a doctor.</i>

01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:54.040
<i> Don't question your father
he knows what's best for this family.</i>

01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:55.550
<i> Who's</i>
<i>gonna help her?</i>

01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:57.680
<i> Sam. We're</i>
<i>gonna help her.</i>

01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:04.650
This is the way
it's got to be, baby girl.

01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:06.120
Only the Lord
can save you now.

01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:10.160
No! No!

01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:13.100
No! Please, no. No!

01:16:15.300 --> 01:16:16.800
You wanna wake the dead?

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:18.100
No, Lisa!

01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:24.610
"Happy shall he be,

01:16:24.610 --> 01:16:27.780
"who taketh and dasheth thy
little ones against the stones."

01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:28.640
No!

01:16:34.690 --> 01:16:36.920
Stay away from my family,
you son of a bitch.

01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:50.930
Do it, Sam.

01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:52.200
He killed her.
It's the only way.

01:16:53.970 --> 01:16:55.710
Put it down.

01:16:57.910 --> 01:17:01.610
Sam, no! Look what he did.

01:17:05.050 --> 01:17:07.750
I'll bury you here with the
rest of my rotten seed.

01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:11.020
Fuck you!

01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:39.220
<i>Eric, what are we gonna do?</i>

01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:45.090
<i> Don't worry.
I won't let anything happen to you.</i>

01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:35.200
Can I help you with something?

01:18:35.210 --> 01:18:36.940
Yeah, I'm Officer Bindara.
I'm the county sheriff.

01:18:43.450 --> 01:18:45.750
It's a long way's off.

01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:48.050
Yeah. You're telling me.

01:18:50.190 --> 01:18:52.960
We had a report from up north
that some kids were missing.

01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:55.830
One of them inherited a house
around here apparently.

01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:56.760
Did you hear
anything about this?

01:18:58.260 --> 01:19:01.200
Yeah, no one has.

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:04.870
Um, can you take a look
at these pictures for me?

01:19:04.870 --> 01:19:07.000
Tell me if any of these kids
look familiar.

01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:20.520
No.

01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:22.820
Never seen them before.

01:19:24.190 --> 01:19:25.820
Well, that figures.

01:19:27.890 --> 01:19:29.290
You, uh... You been
out in this area long?

01:19:30.460 --> 01:19:32.430
Years.
Family friend left it to me.

Well, here's my card.
