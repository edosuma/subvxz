WEBVTT

00:01.669 --> 00:03.371
WILLOW:
This is a nightmare.

00:03.403 --> 00:07.307
This is...
my world is spinning.

00:07.341 --> 00:08.541
It's not that bad,
Willow, really.

00:08.576 --> 00:11.478
740? Verbal?

00:11.512 --> 00:14.515
I'm-I'm pathetic!
Illiterate!

00:14.548 --> 00:16.984
I'm Cletus
the slack-jawed yokel.

00:17.016 --> 00:18.219
That's right.

00:18.251 --> 00:19.652
And the fact that
your 740 verbal

00:19.687 --> 00:21.222
closely resembles
my combined scores

00:21.254 --> 00:24.658
in no way compromises your
position as the village idiot.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.193
I just...

00:26.227 --> 00:29.028
Where did I go wrong?

00:29.062 --> 00:30.897
You did amazing, Willow.

00:30.931 --> 00:32.832
As usual.

00:32.865 --> 00:34.335
You guys get
your scores?
Cordelia!

00:34.368 --> 00:36.204
Willow is very sad

00:36.237 --> 00:38.139
about her academic failure.
How did you do?

00:40.473 --> 00:42.176
This is not good.
What's not good?

00:42.210 --> 00:45.179
XANDER:
Well, I'm just worried
it may hurt

00:45.213 --> 00:46.847
my standing
as campus stud

00:46.880 --> 00:48.582
when people find out
I'm dating a brain.

00:48.615 --> 00:50.350
Please. I have
some experience

00:50.384 --> 00:51.951
in covering
these things up.

00:51.984 --> 00:54.222
Well, I can see why
you'd be upset.

00:54.255 --> 00:55.756
That was
my sarcastic voice.

00:55.789 --> 00:57.725
You know, it sounds a lot
like your regular voice.

00:57.758 --> 00:59.527
I've been told that.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.027
But we should celebrate,
do something.

01:01.060 --> 01:03.097
Like, the four of us?

01:03.131 --> 01:05.031
A double date!

01:05.063 --> 01:06.266
It could have
potential.

01:06.299 --> 01:07.534
Buffy!

01:07.567 --> 01:08.769
Hey, did you get
your S.A.T. Scores?

01:11.405 --> 01:13.274
By the look on your face,
I'm guessing you and I

01:13.307 --> 01:16.277
are going to be manning
the drive-through window
side by side.

01:16.310 --> 01:17.911
They're just
test scores, right?

01:17.944 --> 01:20.513
What do they
really mean, anyway?

01:21.948 --> 01:25.253
1430!
Buffy, you kicked ass!

01:26.120 --> 01:27.221
Okay,

01:27.254 --> 01:29.055
so academic achievement

01:29.088 --> 01:31.057
gets me a little excited.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.460
Buff, that's
amazing.

01:32.492 --> 01:33.727
Let me see that.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.462
Yeah. With scores
like that,

01:35.496 --> 01:37.164
you can apply pretty much
anywhere you want.

01:37.198 --> 01:38.966
Buffy, this could, like,
change your whole future.

01:38.998 --> 01:40.901
The thought had occurred to me.

01:40.933 --> 01:42.436
Then why
the sour puss?

01:42.469 --> 01:45.173
I don't know.
I guess... my future.

01:45.206 --> 01:47.106
I never really
thought about it.

01:47.140 --> 01:48.641
I wasn't even sure
I was going to have one.

01:48.676 --> 01:50.109
Well, I think this is great.

01:50.144 --> 01:51.645
Now you can leave
and never come back!

01:53.313 --> 01:55.983
Well, I mean that
in a positive way.

01:56.015 --> 01:57.585
Get out of Sunnydale.
That's a good thing.

01:57.617 --> 02:00.554
What kind of moron would ever
want to come back here?

02:03.557 --> 02:06.126
(tires squeal)

02:06.159 --> 02:08.162
*

02:14.134 --> 02:18.138
Home... sweet... home.

02:18.171 --> 02:19.872
(laughs)

02:21.841 --> 02:24.944
(wolf howling)

02:24.978 --> 02:27.046
*

03:15.263 --> 03:17.431
SPIKE:
* And more

03:17.465 --> 03:20.433
* Much more than this

03:20.467 --> 03:24.472
* I did it my way.

03:25.473 --> 03:28.408
Drusilla! I'm home!

03:28.442 --> 03:30.877
(laughing hysterically)

03:33.713 --> 03:34.981
(sniffs)

03:36.817 --> 03:39.218
(sobbing)

03:42.756 --> 03:43.990
(sniffs)

03:50.631 --> 03:51.865
Why did you do it, baby?

03:51.899 --> 03:54.502
Why did you leave me?

03:57.003 --> 03:58.805
We were happy here.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.513
(snarls)

04:07.514 --> 04:11.752
You... stupid...
worthless... bitch!

04:14.121 --> 04:16.290
Look what you've done to me.

04:18.526 --> 04:20.927
XANDER: Come on.
It'll be fun.

04:20.961 --> 04:22.295
I don't know.

04:22.329 --> 04:24.665
I just thought we were
going to do something...

04:24.697 --> 04:26.500
you know, classy?

04:26.533 --> 04:28.235
What's classier
than bowling?

04:28.268 --> 04:31.338
Apart from everything ever?
Let's see...

04:31.372 --> 04:33.906
Oz and Willow are down.
You're the swing vote.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.942
I guarantee fun.

04:35.975 --> 04:37.009
(chuckles)

04:38.879 --> 04:40.247
Hey, those are
from the pier.

04:40.279 --> 04:42.483
Yeah. Uh, I just
got them developed.

04:42.516 --> 04:43.750
There's pictures.

04:43.783 --> 04:46.319
Of me. In your locker.

04:47.987 --> 04:49.356
I never knew I was
locker-door material.

04:51.191 --> 04:53.093
Well... just barely.

04:53.125 --> 04:55.928
Besides, I look really cute
in those pictures.

04:55.963 --> 04:59.332
Hey. So what's the verdict?
Do we bowl?

04:59.367 --> 05:00.934
We bowl.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.103
Great!
Double bowling date.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.704
I'm on Oz's team.

05:04.737 --> 05:06.807
Yeah? Well, prepare
to be crushed.

05:06.839 --> 05:09.677
Maybe we should
practice.
Yeah.

05:09.709 --> 05:12.045
They don't stand a chance.
I'm really good.

05:12.079 --> 05:13.514
Or I used to be, when they had

05:13.547 --> 05:15.815
the inflatable things
in the gutters.

05:18.351 --> 05:19.653
What's this?

05:19.687 --> 05:20.887
It's a gift.

05:20.920 --> 05:22.889
What's the occasion?

05:22.923 --> 05:24.557
Pretty much you are.

05:24.591 --> 05:26.726
Aw...

05:26.759 --> 05:29.797
(gasps) It's a little,
a PEZ witch!

05:29.829 --> 05:31.197
It's kind of a theme present.

05:31.230 --> 05:32.466
Do you like it?

05:32.500 --> 05:35.403
I like.
I-I more than like.

05:35.435 --> 05:38.305
Oz, this is probably
the sweetest...

05:38.338 --> 05:40.874
We have to find
a little PEZ werewolf,

05:40.908 --> 05:42.543
so little PEZ witch
can have a boyfriend.

05:42.576 --> 05:45.345
I don't think
they make a werewolf PEZ.

05:45.379 --> 05:47.346
You might have to settle
for a wacky cartoon dog.

05:49.249 --> 05:51.718
This is...
just so thoughtful.

05:53.052 --> 05:55.389
Well, I think
about you.

05:55.423 --> 05:58.992
Oh... I don't have
anything to give you.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.928
Yeah, you do.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.605
Buffy, this is...
this is remarkable.

06:11.639 --> 06:13.507
So is this.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.843
Where is this retreat thingy,
the Yukon?

06:15.875 --> 06:17.911
It's quite nearby,
actually.

06:17.944 --> 06:20.180
It's, um, it's the clearing at
the top of Breaker's Woods.

06:20.213 --> 06:23.750
It's the site of, um,

06:23.783 --> 06:25.685
some fascinating
Druidic rituals.

06:25.718 --> 06:27.721
Okay, but you're
just going

06:27.754 --> 06:29.221
for a few days, right?

06:29.255 --> 06:30.790
I mean, you're not
going to settle there

06:30.824 --> 06:32.793
and grow crops
or anything.

06:32.826 --> 06:35.194
What? Oh, my gear.

06:35.228 --> 06:38.432
No, no, this is...
this is basic necessities.

06:38.466 --> 06:40.600
Giles... you pack like me.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.435
Here.

06:42.470 --> 06:44.303
I suspect your mother will want

06:44.336 --> 06:46.139
to, uh, put it on
the refrigerator.

06:46.173 --> 06:48.375
Yeah. She saw these scores

06:48.408 --> 06:50.409
and her head spun around
and exploded.

06:52.178 --> 06:54.380
I've-I've been on the
Hellmouth too long.

06:54.413 --> 06:55.983
That was metaphorical, yes?

06:56.016 --> 06:57.918
Yes. She was happy.

06:59.351 --> 07:01.622
She started with
all this crazy talk

07:01.654 --> 07:02.889
about me going to college,

07:02.923 --> 07:06.158
maybe
someplace else.

07:06.192 --> 07:08.896
I know. I know, I said that you
were going to have a goat.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.663
Responsibilities and all.
I know the drill.

07:10.697 --> 07:12.632
She may be right.

07:12.665 --> 07:14.334
Yeah, no, I figured you'd...

07:14.367 --> 07:16.504
Okay.

07:16.536 --> 07:17.971
Be kind, rewind.

07:18.004 --> 07:22.074
With scores like these, Buffy,

07:22.108 --> 07:25.245
you could have
a first-rate education.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.346
I'm not suggesting that you

07:27.379 --> 07:31.018
ignore your calling, but, um...

07:31.050 --> 07:32.685
you need to look to your future.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.487
And with Faith here,

07:34.521 --> 07:38.091
it may be that
you can move on...

07:38.125 --> 07:40.159
for a time, at least.

07:40.192 --> 07:42.329
Wow.

07:42.362 --> 07:45.699
Well, let's, um, let's
discuss it when I get back.

07:45.733 --> 07:47.466
In the meantime, um,

07:47.500 --> 07:49.435
I'd like you to continue
training while I'm,

07:49.468 --> 07:51.838
while I'm gone, and, um...
please don't do anything rash.

07:51.872 --> 07:53.673
Anything rash meaning...

07:53.706 --> 07:56.843
Are you planning
on seeing Angel?

07:57.911 --> 07:59.913
Yes, actually, I am.

08:01.348 --> 08:04.216
Look, but there's not
going to be any rash.

08:04.250 --> 08:05.786
Anywhere.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.855
Okay. We're-we're friends.

08:07.887 --> 08:09.122
That's all

08:09.156 --> 08:11.124
either of us wants.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.627
Nothing's going to happen.

08:13.661 --> 08:15.295
WILLOW: Something's
going to happen.

08:15.327 --> 08:17.129
Like what?

08:17.163 --> 08:18.464
It's a mistake.

08:18.497 --> 08:19.867
It's a terrible,
fatal mistake.

08:19.899 --> 08:21.134
I see that now.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.369
It's just bowling.

08:22.401 --> 08:23.803
It's bad bowling.

08:23.836 --> 08:25.973
It's a double date,
with all of us,

08:26.005 --> 08:27.374
and they're
going to know.

08:27.406 --> 08:29.677
How are they going to know?

08:29.709 --> 08:32.546
It's a very
intimate situation.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.981
It's all sexy
with the smoke
and the sweating

08:35.014 --> 08:36.549
and the
shoe rental...

08:36.583 --> 08:38.150
You're turned on
by rented shoes?

08:38.183 --> 08:39.552
That's not the issue.

08:39.586 --> 08:40.821
Okay, well, let me
ask you this.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.221
What are they
going to know?

08:42.254 --> 08:44.658
That we're friends...
old, old friends.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.025
And maybe we've had
one or two indiscretions,

08:46.058 --> 08:47.259
but that's all past.

08:47.293 --> 08:49.562
Look. We're just
very good friends

08:49.596 --> 08:51.197
who like to hang out,

08:51.230 --> 08:52.432
and can I kiss your earlobe?

08:52.465 --> 08:54.366
No! Well, okay.

08:54.400 --> 08:55.501
No!

08:55.534 --> 08:58.071
PEZ!

08:59.538 --> 09:01.341
Maybe bowling might be
too much to handle.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.775
Man!

09:05.044 --> 09:07.114
I wish I wasn't
so attracted to you.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.948
(sighs)

09:08.981 --> 09:10.783
I wish we could
make it all stop.

09:10.817 --> 09:13.754
Any suggestions?

09:13.787 --> 09:16.724
Carnegie-Mellon has
a wonderful design curriculum.

09:16.756 --> 09:19.292
Oh, and Brown University's
history program is...

09:19.326 --> 09:22.028
You like history, right?

09:22.062 --> 09:24.030
Could we talk
about this another time?

09:24.063 --> 09:26.734
All day it's been like,
"Congratulations!" "Go away."

09:26.767 --> 09:29.036
That's not it.
It's just...

09:29.068 --> 09:31.203
you belong at a good,
old-fashioned college

09:31.238 --> 09:32.873
with-with keg parties
and boys,

09:32.905 --> 09:35.274
not here with
Hellmouths and vampires.

09:35.307 --> 09:36.543
(microwave beeping)

09:36.576 --> 09:38.245
Not really seeing
the distinction.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.947
No, you're always
talking about

09:39.980 --> 09:42.215
how you wish you could
lead a more normal life.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.584
Well, this is your chance.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.586
Yeah, it's just
not that simple.

09:46.620 --> 09:48.321
I have responsibilities.

09:48.355 --> 09:50.557
I know, I know, but I spoke with
Mr. Giles, and he said...

09:50.590 --> 09:52.725
That Faith could be Miss
Sunnydale in the slayer pageant.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.461
I know.

09:54.494 --> 09:57.397
It's time to think about
your future, Buffy--

09:57.429 --> 09:58.798
about your whole life.

09:58.831 --> 10:00.133
I mean, honestly,

10:00.167 --> 10:02.001
is there anything
keeping you here?

10:02.034 --> 10:04.037
*

10:19.152 --> 10:21.153
(owl hoots)

10:25.491 --> 10:27.027
(snorts)

10:27.059 --> 10:29.062
(slurring):
Yeah, you...

10:30.831 --> 10:33.866
You think I'm afraid of you?

10:33.900 --> 10:35.634
(scoffs)

10:37.370 --> 10:39.706
We were happy.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.374
You brainwashed her.

10:41.408 --> 10:42.909
(scoffs)
I could just...

10:48.480 --> 10:52.720
Yeah, I'll show you
who's a cool guy.

10:53.721 --> 10:55.022
You're going down.

10:57.924 --> 11:00.027
(birds singing)

11:05.664 --> 11:07.667
(sizzling)

11:09.601 --> 11:12.139
(crackling)

11:12.172 --> 11:13.373
Whoa!

11:13.405 --> 11:15.075
Aah!

11:15.107 --> 11:16.809
Gah!

11:16.844 --> 11:18.077
Aah!

11:19.511 --> 11:21.881
(screaming)

11:29.056 --> 11:30.289
Ohh!

11:32.926 --> 11:34.193
Oh...

11:40.768 --> 11:43.102
This is just too much.

11:43.135 --> 11:44.403
(door closes)

11:45.972 --> 11:47.706
Did you come in
through the back?

11:47.740 --> 11:48.942
SPIKE:
Yeah.

11:48.975 --> 11:51.043
I need a curse.

11:51.077 --> 11:52.278
A what?

11:52.312 --> 11:54.014
A curse.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.048
You know,
something nasty.

11:56.082 --> 11:58.350
Boils. I want
to give him boils

11:58.384 --> 11:59.586
all over his face.

11:59.619 --> 12:01.187
You know,
dripping pustules.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.222
Let's really go
for the gusto here.

12:03.255 --> 12:05.625
I'm hearing a lot of negative
energy, and I bet...
Leprosy!

12:05.658 --> 12:08.028
All right? A spell that
makes his parts fall off.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.261
That sounds proper.

12:09.296 --> 12:11.899
We don't carry... leprosy.

12:11.932 --> 12:14.000
Would you excuse me
a moment?

12:15.402 --> 12:16.970
Blessed be.

12:17.004 --> 12:19.405
Anything in particular
I can help you find?

12:19.438 --> 12:21.808
Yeah.
It's all here on the list.

12:21.841 --> 12:24.744
Skincrute, essence of rosethorn,
canary feathers.

12:24.778 --> 12:26.145
Aha! A love spell.

12:26.178 --> 12:28.981
Want that old lover
to come back to you?

12:30.850 --> 12:32.284
Are you sure you know
what you're doing, hon?

12:32.318 --> 12:33.886
No. Well, I mean, yes.

12:33.921 --> 12:36.789
I... I know how
to do a love spell,

12:36.823 --> 12:40.159
but this is more
of an anti-love spell.

12:40.192 --> 12:42.461
Yeah. Uh, kind of a de-lusting.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.965
The supplies are
basically the same, right?

12:44.998 --> 12:46.399
Basically.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.768
Although raven feathers
tend to breed

12:48.802 --> 12:51.238
a little more discontent
than canary.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.306
Let me just get some things...

12:53.340 --> 12:55.075
CLERK:
Okay.

12:55.107 --> 12:56.909
Mm-hmm.

12:56.943 --> 12:59.645
That will be...
$15.80 for the lot.

13:01.780 --> 13:03.615
Thanks!

13:10.490 --> 13:12.125
So, did you find a spell book?

13:12.158 --> 13:13.360
(snarls)

13:13.393 --> 13:14.561
Forget the book.

13:21.567 --> 13:23.971
I just got a better idea.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.850
MAYOR:
Oh, look at that--
every time.

13:37.884 --> 13:40.320
Cuts to the left.

13:40.352 --> 13:43.155
See? And it's not
the carpet, it's me.

13:43.190 --> 13:45.057
I swear, I would
sell my soul

13:45.091 --> 13:47.693
for a decent short
game. Of course...

13:47.726 --> 13:50.864
it's a little late for that.

13:50.898 --> 13:52.865
I don't suppose I could
offer your soul, huh?

13:52.899 --> 13:54.201
Really help me on the green.

13:57.037 --> 13:58.638
I'm just funning.

13:58.671 --> 14:01.207
So, we have
a Spike problem, do we?

14:01.240 --> 14:02.909
He's been spotted back in town.

14:02.942 --> 14:06.879
And there was an incident at
a magic shop in broad daylight.

14:06.913 --> 14:09.481
Police had a hell of a time
covering it up.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.250
(chuckles)
Well, yes.

14:11.283 --> 14:13.753
You know, he was up to all sorts
of shenanigans last year.

14:13.785 --> 14:16.088
We had a world of fun trying
to guess what he'd do next.

14:16.123 --> 14:18.225
I remember.

14:18.258 --> 14:19.591
(whistles)

14:19.625 --> 14:22.028
But I guess
we're past that now.

14:22.062 --> 14:23.730
This year is too important

14:23.763 --> 14:26.066
to let a loose cannon
rock the boat.

14:26.099 --> 14:28.400
Should I have
Mr. Trick send a...

14:28.434 --> 14:30.769
committee to deal with this?

14:30.802 --> 14:33.773
Loose cannon, rock the boat--
is that a mixed metaphor?

14:33.806 --> 14:34.774
Uh...

14:34.807 --> 14:36.676
Boats did have cannons,

14:36.709 --> 14:39.778
and a loose one
would cause it to rock.

14:39.812 --> 14:43.716
Oh, honestly. I don't know
where my mind goes these days.

14:43.750 --> 14:45.751
Why don't you take care
of that Spike problem?

14:45.784 --> 14:47.754
A committee, like you said.

14:47.787 --> 14:49.255
As good as done.

14:49.288 --> 14:51.290
That's swell. Fore!

14:53.092 --> 14:54.293
Hey!

14:58.431 --> 15:00.767
College, huh?

15:00.799 --> 15:02.601
Higher education.

15:02.634 --> 15:04.270
Kind of an intense proposition.

15:04.303 --> 15:06.739
Where do you want to go?

15:06.773 --> 15:08.575
I have no idea.

15:08.607 --> 15:10.476
My mom was the one
that got all these.

15:10.509 --> 15:14.081
She's so excited.
She can't stop talking about it.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.149
AI had a really hard time
coming up with an alibi

15:16.182 --> 15:17.817
so I could come over here.

15:19.686 --> 15:20.886
She doesn't know about me.

15:20.919 --> 15:23.755
Big no.

15:23.789 --> 15:25.958
She's having enough trouble
dealing with the slayer issue.

15:25.993 --> 15:29.828
I don't think she's ready to
process the information that...

15:29.861 --> 15:32.664
you and I are friends again.

15:32.698 --> 15:34.167
Anyway, I think
this college jones

15:34.201 --> 15:36.903
is just a reaction
to the whole slayer thing.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.138
She wants you to get out.

15:38.171 --> 15:41.774
Someplace a little
less Hellmouthy.

15:41.807 --> 15:43.976
She has a point, you know?

15:44.010 --> 15:45.778
But there are reasons
to stay, too.

15:45.812 --> 15:48.347
What are they?

15:49.481 --> 15:52.451
Um... well, you know, there's...

15:52.485 --> 15:56.255
my slayer duties, obviously.

15:56.288 --> 15:58.191
What do you think I should do?

15:58.225 --> 16:00.226
As a friend, uh...

16:02.461 --> 16:04.797
I think that you
should leave.

16:04.831 --> 16:08.500
This is a good
opportunity for you.

16:11.038 --> 16:13.105
Yeah.

16:13.139 --> 16:16.576
It's not like there's any
great thing keeping me here.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.713
Thanks for the advice.

16:21.748 --> 16:24.384
It's another perspective
to consider.

16:24.417 --> 16:25.817
Where you going?

16:25.851 --> 16:28.488
You just got here.
It's early.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.222
Yeah, well, my mom
starts worrying

16:30.256 --> 16:32.959
a lot earlier these days.

16:32.991 --> 16:34.760
I'll stop by soon.

16:41.734 --> 16:43.870
Whoa! It smells like
church in here.

16:43.903 --> 16:45.371
(sniffs) No, wait...

16:45.404 --> 16:47.005
evil church.

16:47.039 --> 16:49.741
It's just chemistry stuff.
An experiment.

16:49.775 --> 16:51.077
So you said
when you called.

16:51.110 --> 16:52.879
Why do I have
to be here?

16:52.912 --> 16:55.182
It'll help you on the exam.
You're way behind.

16:55.215 --> 16:58.017
But that's why
you love me, right?

16:58.051 --> 16:59.918
Academically dangerous?

16:59.951 --> 17:01.587
Here. Hold this.

17:01.620 --> 17:04.957
A feather. And who
will I be tickling?

17:05.692 --> 17:06.925
Shush.

17:08.894 --> 17:11.998
Okay. Bring mixture
to a boil.

17:12.030 --> 17:13.865
I assume this
won't make us late

17:13.900 --> 17:16.435
for our evening
of bowling magic?

17:16.469 --> 17:17.935
There's no magic.

17:17.970 --> 17:20.573
I mean...
Bowling, yeah.

17:20.606 --> 17:22.775
Cordelia and Oz are gonna
meet us here later.

17:22.808 --> 17:24.477
Can we turn
these lights on?

17:27.779 --> 17:29.348
Is that a spell book?

17:29.382 --> 17:30.616
No, no, no.

17:30.650 --> 17:33.519
Chemistry book.

17:33.552 --> 17:34.520
Wait a minute.

17:34.554 --> 17:35.855
This is love spell stuff.

17:35.887 --> 17:37.423
You doing a love spell?

17:37.457 --> 17:40.426
No, of course not.
This is a purely scientific...

17:41.560 --> 17:43.195
de-lusting spell.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.064
For us. I thought
it would go better

17:45.097 --> 17:46.432
if you didn't know.

17:46.465 --> 17:48.401
Are you nuts?
Or have you forgotten

17:48.434 --> 17:50.537
that I tend to have bad luck
with these sorts of spells?

17:50.569 --> 17:51.770
But you said you wished that

17:51.804 --> 17:53.038
these feelings
could just go away.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.307
Yeah, I wish
for a lot of things.

17:54.340 --> 17:55.907
I told you I wished
I was a fireman

17:55.942 --> 17:57.443
when we were in sixth grade,
but you didn't

17:57.477 --> 17:58.711
follow through on that.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.247
I can't do this anymore, Xander.

18:00.279 --> 18:03.549
I mean, this whole
"us" thing is... bleagh.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.585
So, do you really need to resort
to the black arts

18:05.617 --> 18:07.086
to keep our hormones
in check?

18:07.119 --> 18:10.056
At this point,
I'm thinking no.

18:10.088 --> 18:11.891
I'm gonna get the lights,

18:11.923 --> 18:13.893
clean this place up
before they get here

18:13.925 --> 18:16.262
and start asking questions.

18:16.296 --> 18:17.763
Xander!

18:17.797 --> 18:19.999
(grunting)
I need to borrow
the little girl.

18:20.031 --> 18:23.635
You don't mind, do you?

18:27.038 --> 18:29.308
(grunts)

18:29.342 --> 18:30.609
Are you threatening me?
(chuckles)

18:30.643 --> 18:32.077
That's not nice.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.614
We're all gonna be
very best friends.

18:37.115 --> 18:38.317
Xander!

18:41.119 --> 18:44.656
A spell. For me.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.358
You're gonna
do a spell for me.

18:46.393 --> 18:48.861
Uh, what kind of spell?

18:48.894 --> 18:52.632
A love spell!
Are you brain-dead?

18:54.334 --> 18:56.435
I'm gonna get what's mine.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.837
What's mine.

18:58.871 --> 19:01.140
Teach her to walk out on me.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.147
What are you staring at?

19:09.182 --> 19:10.349
Nothing.

19:10.383 --> 19:12.117
You can do it, right?

19:12.151 --> 19:13.553
You can make Dru love me again,

19:13.586 --> 19:14.886
make her crawl.

19:14.921 --> 19:17.390
I-I can try.

19:17.423 --> 19:19.125
What are you talking
about, trying?

19:19.157 --> 19:20.359
You'll do it.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.929
Yes, I'll do it.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.900
You lie to me,

19:27.933 --> 19:30.303
and I'll shove this through
your face. You want that?

19:30.336 --> 19:31.703
No.
Right through to your brain.

19:31.738 --> 19:34.540
No. Please, no.

19:38.778 --> 19:41.580
She wouldn't even kill me.

19:45.050 --> 19:47.052
She just left.

19:49.455 --> 19:51.891
She didn't even care
enough to cut off my head

19:51.923 --> 19:53.859
or set me on fire.

19:53.893 --> 19:56.528
I mean, is that too much to ask?

19:56.563 --> 20:00.267
You know?
Some little sign that she cared?

20:03.569 --> 20:07.038
It was that truce
with Buffy that did it.

20:07.073 --> 20:09.541
Dru said I'd gone soft.

20:09.576 --> 20:12.845
Wasn't demon enough
for the likes of her.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.681
I told her it didn't
mean anything,

20:14.713 --> 20:16.282
I was thinking of
her the whole time,

20:16.316 --> 20:18.684
but she didn't care.

20:18.718 --> 20:22.188
So, we got to Brazil,
and she was...

20:22.221 --> 20:24.723
she was just different.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.594
I gave her everything--

20:27.626 --> 20:30.563
beautiful jewels,
beautiful dresses

20:30.596 --> 20:31.963
with beautiful
girls in them,

20:31.998 --> 20:34.366
but nothing
made her happy.

20:34.401 --> 20:37.737
And she would flirt.

20:37.769 --> 20:39.605
I caught her
on a park bench,

20:39.638 --> 20:41.641
making out with
a chaos demon.

20:41.673 --> 20:43.942
Have you ever seen
a chaos demon? (scoffs)

20:43.976 --> 20:47.246
They're all slime and antlers.
They're disgusting.

20:51.817 --> 20:55.253
She only did it to hurt me.

20:55.288 --> 20:57.824
So I said,

20:57.856 --> 20:59.791
"I'm not putting up
with this anymore."

20:59.826 --> 21:02.127
and she said, "Fine."

21:02.161 --> 21:04.396
and I said, "Yeah, I've got
an unlife, you know."

21:04.431 --> 21:06.732
And then she said...

21:06.766 --> 21:09.836
sh-she said we could
still be friends.

21:11.337 --> 21:15.273
God, I'm so unhappy.

21:15.307 --> 21:16.308
There, there.

21:16.343 --> 21:17.977
I mean, friends.

21:18.009 --> 21:20.779
How could she be so cruel?

21:22.280 --> 21:23.982
(sniffles)

21:24.016 --> 21:26.085
Mmm.

21:26.117 --> 21:28.621
That smell.

21:29.855 --> 21:34.160
Your neck...

21:34.192 --> 21:36.863
I haven't had a woman in weeks.

21:36.895 --> 21:38.530
Whoa, no.
Hold it.

21:38.565 --> 21:40.633
Well, unless you count
that shopkeeper.

21:40.666 --> 21:42.602
Now... now, hold on.

21:42.634 --> 21:44.703
I-I'll do your spell
for you, and-and...

21:44.737 --> 21:46.338
and I'll get you
Drusilla back,

21:46.373 --> 21:49.541
but-but there will be
no bottle in face,

21:49.576 --> 21:53.380
a-and there will be no "having"
of any kind with me.

21:53.413 --> 21:54.881
All right?

21:54.913 --> 21:56.182
(whimpers)

21:59.218 --> 22:00.487
All right.

22:03.522 --> 22:05.692
Get started.

22:05.724 --> 22:09.628
Now, I'm not
a real witch, you know.

22:09.662 --> 22:12.565
I-I don't know if this is
gonna work right away.

22:12.598 --> 22:16.234
Well, if at first
you don't succeed...

22:16.268 --> 22:17.537
I'll kill him

22:17.569 --> 22:19.005
and you try again.

22:22.273 --> 22:25.412
This... isn't enough.

22:25.444 --> 22:27.179
What?

22:27.212 --> 22:29.548
Well, there are
other ingredients.

22:29.582 --> 22:33.085
A-And a book. I need
a spell book. This isn't it.

22:33.118 --> 22:35.688
You've got it, though.
At home?

22:35.721 --> 22:39.625
Not at home.
I left it somewhere.

22:43.061 --> 22:44.564
Where?

22:52.238 --> 22:53.605
Thank God,
you are here.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.708
Yeah. Not all of us
have dates tonight.

22:55.741 --> 22:57.209
Something's up.

23:00.378 --> 23:02.347
We were supposed
to meet in here.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.215
I don't know
what could have happened.

23:04.250 --> 23:05.951
What is all this stuff?

23:05.984 --> 23:07.886
I'm thinking
weird science.

23:07.920 --> 23:10.388
Was Willow messing with
her magic tricks again?

23:10.423 --> 23:11.891
Maybe they disappeared.

23:11.923 --> 23:14.961
Maybe she turned Xander
into something ishy.

23:14.993 --> 23:16.962
Whatever happened,
there was obviously a fight.

23:16.996 --> 23:18.597
I don't see any blood.

23:18.631 --> 23:21.267
Yeah, either they were taken,
or they ran, or maybe...

23:21.299 --> 23:23.368
You're having
too many "or's". Pick one.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.571
I don't know. I need you
guys to find Giles, okay?

23:25.605 --> 23:27.574
I'm gonna look for them.
Maybe they didn't get too far.

23:27.606 --> 23:29.375
Where is Giles?

23:29.407 --> 23:31.577
Uh, he's at a retreat in the
clearing in Breaker's Woods.

23:31.611 --> 23:33.813
Yeah, I know the spot,
but it's like a 45-minute drive.

23:33.846 --> 23:35.114
So motor.

23:39.586 --> 23:42.253
(telephone rings)

23:42.288 --> 23:43.955
Giles?

23:43.990 --> 23:45.557
JOYCE: Hi, Buffy.
You still working out?

23:45.592 --> 23:47.794
Uh, no, mom, actually...

23:47.826 --> 23:49.796
I was hoping
that we could schedule

23:49.828 --> 23:53.465
a college talk
later tonight. I admit

23:53.500 --> 23:55.334
I overreacted before.

23:55.366 --> 23:57.604
You don't have to go
all the way across the country.

23:57.636 --> 23:59.506
I, um, I picked up
some brochures

23:59.538 --> 24:01.473
from some nearby schools, okay?

24:01.508 --> 24:02.974
That's great, Mom,
but now's really not a good...

24:03.009 --> 24:04.343
SPIKE:
Hello, Joyce.

24:13.184 --> 24:15.688
So I'm strolling through
the park, looking for a meal.

24:15.721 --> 24:17.957
And I happen to walk by,
and she's making out

24:17.990 --> 24:21.027
with a chaos demon.
And so I said,

24:21.059 --> 24:23.261
"You know, I don't have
to put up with this."

24:23.295 --> 24:25.096
And she said, "Fine."

24:25.131 --> 24:28.267
So I said, "Fine,
do whatever you like."

24:28.299 --> 24:31.269
I mean, I thought we were
gonna make up, you know?

24:31.303 --> 24:33.673
Well, she sounds
very unreasonable.

24:33.705 --> 24:36.675
She is. She's out
of her mind.

24:36.709 --> 24:39.846
That's what I miss most
about her.

24:39.878 --> 24:41.881
Well, Spike, sometimes
even when two people

24:41.913 --> 24:43.214
seem right for each other,

24:43.249 --> 24:45.351
their lives just take
different paths.

24:45.384 --> 24:47.185
Like when Buffy's father
and I...

24:47.219 --> 24:50.923
No, this is different.
Our love was eternal. Literally.

24:52.659 --> 24:55.728
You got any of those
little marshmallows?

24:55.761 --> 24:57.763
Uh, let me look.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.509
(grunts, growls)

25:12.679 --> 25:13.980
Spike.
Oh, my God.

25:14.012 --> 25:15.582
Get out of here.

25:15.615 --> 25:17.316
Yeah, you're not invited.

25:17.348 --> 25:18.817
JOYCE:
He's crazy. He'll kill us.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.319
Not while I breathe.
Well, actually,
I don't breathe.

25:21.353 --> 25:22.888
Joyce, listen to me.

25:22.922 --> 25:24.222
You get out of this house

25:24.256 --> 25:25.892
or I will stake you myself.

25:25.924 --> 25:28.094
You're a very bad man.

25:28.126 --> 25:31.830
Joyce, you can't trust him.
Invite me in.

25:31.864 --> 25:33.599
You touch her
and I'll cut your head off.

25:33.633 --> 25:34.767
Yeah? You and what army?

25:34.800 --> 25:35.934
That would be me.

25:35.968 --> 25:38.170
(grunts)

25:38.203 --> 25:40.506
Angel... why don't you
come on in?

25:40.538 --> 25:42.240
JOYCE:
Oh...

25:42.273 --> 25:44.175
oh, no.

25:44.210 --> 25:45.778
You shouldn't have
come back, Spike.

25:45.811 --> 25:47.278
I do what I please.

25:47.313 --> 25:49.915
O-Okay, I'm confused again.
(grunts)

25:49.949 --> 25:51.750
Willow!

25:51.784 --> 25:53.451
You took Willow.

25:53.484 --> 25:55.453
You do me now, you'll
never find the little witch.

25:55.487 --> 25:57.088
Willow's a witch?

25:57.123 --> 25:58.590
And Xander?
Him, too.

25:58.625 --> 26:00.526
Wait, Xander's a witch? I...

26:00.558 --> 26:01.827
Where are they, huh?

26:03.394 --> 26:05.297
Doesn't work like that, peaches.

26:05.330 --> 26:07.266
And when did you become
all soul-having again?

26:07.298 --> 26:08.867
I thought
you outgrew that.

26:08.901 --> 26:11.269
Your friend's gonna
work a little magic for me.

26:11.303 --> 26:13.471
If she does my spell,
I'll let 'em both go.

26:13.505 --> 26:15.307
You're not famous for keeping
your promises, Spike.

26:15.340 --> 26:16.942
Well, you and your
great poof here

26:16.976 --> 26:19.211
want to tag along, that's fine.

26:19.244 --> 26:21.380
But you get in my way,

26:21.413 --> 26:23.414
and you kill your friends.

26:33.759 --> 26:35.994
What if they were kidnapped
by Colombian drug lords?

26:36.028 --> 26:39.766
They could be cutting off
Xander's ear right now.

26:39.798 --> 26:41.000
Or other parts.

26:41.032 --> 26:42.201
(sniffs)
(breaks squeak)

26:44.502 --> 26:45.738
Hello?

26:45.771 --> 26:47.807
(sniffing)

26:48.974 --> 26:50.608
It's Willow.

26:50.643 --> 26:52.411
She's nearby.

26:52.443 --> 26:55.447
What? You can smell her?

26:55.480 --> 26:57.415
She doesn't even wear perfume.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.652
She's afraid.

26:59.685 --> 27:01.854
CORDELIA:
Oh, my God. Is this some sort of

27:01.887 --> 27:05.290
residual werewolf thing?
This is very disturbing.

27:05.324 --> 27:07.326
I really agree.

27:11.029 --> 27:12.865
Look, I just need
a few supplies,

27:12.898 --> 27:15.134
and then I'll take you to...

27:15.166 --> 27:16.769
Oh, God.

27:16.803 --> 27:18.871
What's wrong,
not that I care?

27:18.904 --> 27:21.272
Oh, my head.
I think I'm sobering up.

27:21.307 --> 27:23.174
It's horrible.

27:23.209 --> 27:25.443
Oh, God, I wish I was dead.

27:25.477 --> 27:28.013
Well, if you close your eyes
and wish real hard...

27:28.047 --> 27:29.480
Hey, back off.
Buffy.

27:29.515 --> 27:31.549
we still need him
to find the others.

27:31.583 --> 27:34.019
Need him?
He's probably

27:34.052 --> 27:36.387
just got 'em
locked up in the factory.

27:36.422 --> 27:39.692
Well, hey, how thick
do you think I am?

27:41.160 --> 27:44.063
Fine. Can we just
get this over with?

27:49.101 --> 27:51.037
Oh, God.

27:51.069 --> 27:52.771
Now what?

27:54.773 --> 27:58.044
We killed a homeless
man on this bench.

27:58.076 --> 28:00.078
Me and Dru.

28:02.048 --> 28:04.383
Those were good times.

28:07.118 --> 28:09.188
(short chuckle)

28:09.221 --> 28:12.090
You know, he begged for mercy,

28:12.124 --> 28:14.727
and you know, that only
made her bite harder.

28:16.461 --> 28:19.397
I guess you had
to be there.

28:24.603 --> 28:27.573
Your work?

28:27.605 --> 28:30.910
Here's your list.

28:32.478 --> 28:34.445
Essence of violet,
cloves... Angel?

28:34.480 --> 28:36.548
Right.

28:36.582 --> 28:38.384
Set of runic tablets.

28:38.416 --> 28:41.788
Spike can get
the rat's eyes.

28:41.820 --> 28:44.423
I used to bring her rats.

28:44.455 --> 28:46.224
With the morning paper.

28:46.258 --> 28:48.294
Great, more moping.
That's gonna get her back.

28:48.326 --> 28:50.962
The spell's gonna get her back.

28:50.997 --> 28:52.964
Lot of trouble for somebody
who doesn't even care about you.

28:52.999 --> 28:55.134
Shut your gob.

28:55.166 --> 28:57.202
She really is just
kind of fickle.

28:57.236 --> 28:58.971
Shut up!

29:03.942 --> 29:06.979
What do you know?
It's your fault,

29:07.012 --> 29:09.748
the both of you.
She belongs with me.

29:12.018 --> 29:14.286
I'm nothing without her.

29:14.319 --> 29:16.122
Yeah, that
I'll have to agree with.

29:16.154 --> 29:18.156
You're pathetic, you know
that? You're not even

29:18.190 --> 29:20.659
a loser anymore.
You're a shell of a loser.

29:20.692 --> 29:23.662
Yeah. You're one to talk.

29:25.263 --> 29:26.597
Meaning?

29:28.099 --> 29:29.969
The last time
I looked in on you two,

29:30.001 --> 29:31.670
you were fighting to the death.

29:31.702 --> 29:33.806
Now you're back making
googly eyes at each other

29:33.839 --> 29:35.240
like nothing happened.

29:35.273 --> 29:36.741
Makes me want to heave.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.243
I don't know what
you're talking about.

29:38.277 --> 29:39.945
Oh, yeah. You're
just friends.

29:39.979 --> 29:42.280
That's right.

29:42.314 --> 29:45.284
You're not friends.

29:45.317 --> 29:47.019
You'll never be friends.

29:47.052 --> 29:50.489
You'll be in love till
it kills you both.

29:50.521 --> 29:52.858
You'll fight

29:52.892 --> 29:54.826
and you'll shag,

29:54.861 --> 29:56.996
and you'll hate each other
till it makes you quiver,

29:57.028 --> 29:59.932
but you'll never be friends.

29:59.965 --> 30:02.835
Love isn't brains,
children, it's blood.

30:02.868 --> 30:06.505
Blood screaming inside you
to work its will.

30:07.906 --> 30:09.807
I may be love's bitch,

30:09.842 --> 30:12.510
but at least I'm man enough
to admit it.

30:17.316 --> 30:19.151
Hm.

30:20.152 --> 30:22.587
Eye of rat.

30:23.923 --> 30:26.025
(grunting)

30:29.428 --> 30:31.596
(moans)

30:37.536 --> 30:39.671
Xander?

30:39.704 --> 30:41.472
Are you okay?

30:41.507 --> 30:43.910
Dizzy.

30:43.942 --> 30:47.546
Kind of nauseous, too.

30:47.578 --> 30:50.249
Do I remember
having a fight with Spike?

30:50.281 --> 30:51.583
You do.

30:55.287 --> 30:57.056
I won, right?

30:57.088 --> 30:58.757
Kicked his ass?

30:58.789 --> 31:00.692
You were real brave.

31:00.726 --> 31:02.228
Do you need to barf?

31:02.260 --> 31:04.262
No, I'll be okay.

31:06.231 --> 31:07.833
Where are we?

31:07.865 --> 31:10.402
The factory.
We're locked in the basement.

31:10.435 --> 31:12.871
That burnt-out place
in the middle of nowhere?

31:13.872 --> 31:16.442
So we're pretty much in a
"scream all you want" scenario.

31:16.474 --> 31:17.910
Pretty much.

31:17.943 --> 31:19.411
Why didn't he just kill us?

31:19.444 --> 31:21.613
He wants me
to do a love spell.

31:21.646 --> 31:22.949
What?

31:22.981 --> 31:25.084
Drusilla broke up with him.

31:25.116 --> 31:27.419
Gee, and we had all hoped
those crazy kids

31:27.452 --> 31:29.121
would make it work.

31:29.154 --> 31:30.788
He's out of control.

31:30.821 --> 31:34.692
I mean, not that he was
Joe Restraint in the old days.

31:34.726 --> 31:37.395
So what are our options?

31:37.429 --> 31:39.798
Well, I figure either

31:39.830 --> 31:42.300
I refuse to do the spell
and he kills us,

31:42.334 --> 31:45.871
or I do the spell
and he kills us.

31:45.903 --> 31:47.873
Give me a third option.

31:47.905 --> 31:51.076
He's so drunk he forgets about
us and we starve to death.

31:51.109 --> 31:52.911
That's sort of the best one.

31:52.944 --> 31:55.948
Will, we're not gonna die.

31:55.981 --> 31:58.584
If he's so drunk,
he'll get sloppy,

31:58.616 --> 32:00.919
and then I'll make my move.
Oh!

32:00.952 --> 32:03.955
As long as my move
doesn't involve standing up

32:03.990 --> 32:07.425
or using my limbs,
we'll be okay.

32:08.759 --> 32:10.496
We're not supposed to.

32:10.528 --> 32:14.266
Exemption for impending
death situation.

32:28.713 --> 32:30.215
Oh, God.

32:31.317 --> 32:33.318
Oh, God.
Oh, God, Oz.

32:33.352 --> 32:36.989
We have to get out of here.

32:38.390 --> 32:39.991
Cordy, I...

32:42.361 --> 32:44.762
Cordelia!

32:44.796 --> 32:46.531
(moans)

32:46.565 --> 32:48.166
Cordelia!

32:49.234 --> 32:51.237
I fell...

32:57.042 --> 32:58.844
Okay, Spike, we got the
stuff. Where are they?

32:58.876 --> 33:00.612
What's your hurry?

33:00.645 --> 33:03.382
My hurry is my intense desire
to get you out of my life.

33:03.414 --> 33:04.950
You tend to cause trouble.

33:04.982 --> 33:06.852
I'll be out of your life
in a few short hours.

33:06.884 --> 33:07.719
No trouble at all.

33:07.752 --> 33:09.188
Hello, Spike.

33:09.221 --> 33:10.521
(growling)

33:17.496 --> 33:19.265
No trouble at all.

33:24.702 --> 33:26.538
Lenny, how have you been?

33:26.571 --> 33:30.409
Better since you left.
You should have stayed gone.

33:30.442 --> 33:32.577
Is that right?

33:32.611 --> 33:34.880
You know, he was just leaving.
Don't you start anything.

33:34.913 --> 33:37.383
This pissant
used to work for me.

33:37.415 --> 33:38.849
The guys are in trouble.
We can't risk this.

33:38.884 --> 33:40.318
I don't think
we have a choice.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.921
You other two can
walk away from this.

33:42.953 --> 33:45.757
I die, your chums die.

33:45.790 --> 33:47.858
Sorry. We're staying.

33:47.893 --> 33:49.694
Not for long.

33:49.728 --> 33:52.029
(growling)

33:52.064 --> 33:54.599
(grunting)

34:00.306 --> 34:01.472
Aah!

34:28.065 --> 34:29.934
(grunting)

34:50.688 --> 34:52.757
(growling)

35:02.867 --> 35:04.969
Go!

35:10.175 --> 35:11.677
This should be a kick.

35:11.710 --> 35:14.179
I violently dislike you.

35:15.280 --> 35:16.514
(crash)

35:33.998 --> 35:36.101
Be careful.

35:36.134 --> 35:38.204
Yeah.
Oh, God.

35:38.237 --> 35:41.172
WILLOW:
Don't move, Cordy.
Oz went to get help.

35:42.840 --> 35:44.842
Aah!

35:59.257 --> 36:00.326
We need to get out of here.

36:00.358 --> 36:01.492
Can we get to the roof?

36:13.338 --> 36:16.041
Yeah. I heard
you'd gone soft.

36:16.074 --> 36:17.842
Sad to see it, man.

36:17.876 --> 36:18.976
Soft?

36:19.010 --> 36:20.778
Yeah, like baby food.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.583
Well, then,
let's give baby a taste.

36:39.097 --> 36:40.431
I'm all right.

36:40.465 --> 36:42.501
You're not up to
your full strength yet.

36:42.534 --> 36:44.335
(window rattling)
That window's about to go.

36:44.369 --> 36:46.070
Buffy.

36:49.106 --> 36:52.878
Baby like his supper?
Baby like his supper?

36:55.914 --> 36:58.583
Why doesn't baby have a nap?

36:58.617 --> 37:01.186
Aah!

37:01.219 --> 37:02.954
Spike, get down!

37:08.594 --> 37:10.329
Aah!

37:17.768 --> 37:20.472
(screaming)

37:20.505 --> 37:22.507
Now, that was fun.

37:24.610 --> 37:28.246
Oh, don't tell me
that wasn't fun.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.449
(chuckles)

37:30.481 --> 37:32.918
God! It's been
so long since I had

37:32.951 --> 37:35.052
a decent spot
of violence.

37:35.085 --> 37:36.855
Really puts things
in perspective.

37:38.023 --> 37:40.391
Oh, yeah. You two.

37:40.425 --> 37:42.059
Just friends.

37:42.092 --> 37:43.795
No danger there.

37:43.829 --> 37:45.396
Could we just do
the damn spell now?

37:45.431 --> 37:47.833
Oh, sod the spell.
Your friends are at the factory.

37:47.865 --> 37:49.900
I'm really glad

37:49.934 --> 37:51.503
I came here, you know?

37:51.536 --> 37:53.905
I've been all wrongheaded
about this...

37:53.938 --> 37:56.807
weeping, crawling,
blaming everybody else.

37:56.842 --> 38:00.010
I want Dru back,
I just got to be the man I was,

38:00.045 --> 38:01.347
the man she loved.

38:01.380 --> 38:02.813
I'm going to do

38:02.847 --> 38:04.248
what I should have
done in the first place.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.318
I'll find her, wherever she is,

38:06.351 --> 38:08.420
tie her up, torture her

38:08.454 --> 38:10.889
until she likes me again.

38:15.293 --> 38:18.563
Love's a funny thing.

38:20.398 --> 38:21.867
(Cordelia moans)

38:25.503 --> 38:27.072
Cordy...

38:28.639 --> 38:29.875
Please hold on.

38:29.907 --> 38:31.976
Xander?

38:34.846 --> 38:37.248
I can't see you.

38:41.686 --> 38:42.920
(exhales)

38:44.322 --> 38:46.557
Cordy!

38:49.360 --> 38:52.898
He created all things
in order that they might exist.

38:52.931 --> 38:55.333
And the generative forces
of this world are wholesome

38:55.367 --> 38:57.635
and there is no
destructive poison in them.

38:57.668 --> 39:00.038
For the dominion of Hades
is not on Earth,

39:00.070 --> 39:02.440
for righteousness is immortal.

39:04.342 --> 39:06.878
So Cordelia's going to be okay?

39:06.911 --> 39:08.313
She lost a lot
of blood.

39:08.346 --> 39:12.083
None of her vitals
were punctured.

39:12.117 --> 39:14.985
Has she talked
to Xander yet?

39:15.019 --> 39:17.688
Well, she wasn't allowed
to have visitors at first.

39:17.722 --> 39:20.125
He's going to
see her today.

39:21.559 --> 39:23.094
And Oz?

39:25.195 --> 39:27.932
I never knew there was
anything inside me

39:27.965 --> 39:30.367
that could feel
this bad.

39:32.369 --> 39:34.271
For the longest time,

39:34.304 --> 39:37.775
I didn't know
what I wanted.

39:37.809 --> 39:39.811
I wanted everything.

39:40.811 --> 39:43.380
And now...

39:43.414 --> 39:45.250
I just...

39:45.282 --> 39:48.887
I just want him
to talk to me again.

39:48.920 --> 39:51.222
Just give it some time.

39:51.255 --> 39:54.224
And be prepared
for some groveling.

39:54.259 --> 39:55.594
Oh, I'm ready.

39:55.626 --> 39:57.695
I'm all over
groveling.

39:57.728 --> 40:00.498
Good. Because, you know,
I hear sometimes it works.

40:02.300 --> 40:04.302
(monitor beeping softly)

40:06.070 --> 40:07.639
(knocking)

40:07.672 --> 40:09.675
Can I come in?

40:12.811 --> 40:15.681
They wouldn't let me
see you until now.

40:20.686 --> 40:22.688
Those are flowers.

40:28.293 --> 40:30.260
Look, Cordy,

40:30.295 --> 40:31.663
I want you
to know that I...

40:31.697 --> 40:33.831
Xander?

40:35.099 --> 40:37.001
Yeah.

40:38.704 --> 40:41.139
Stay away from me.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.451
*

41:03.161 --> 41:05.163
(crying)

41:13.304 --> 41:15.306
(footsteps)

41:17.809 --> 41:19.043
Hey.

41:22.813 --> 41:24.882
I was wondering
when you were coming.

41:26.585 --> 41:28.353
I'm not coming back.

41:33.324 --> 41:36.126
We're not friends.

41:36.161 --> 41:38.163
We never were.

41:39.597 --> 41:42.967
And I can fool Giles,

41:43.001 --> 41:45.469
and I can fool
my friends,

41:45.503 --> 41:48.574
but I can't fool myself.

41:48.606 --> 41:51.041
Or Spike, for some reason.

41:54.780 --> 41:56.847
What I want from you,
I can never have.

41:59.684 --> 42:01.485
You don't need me
to take care of you

42:01.518 --> 42:03.655
anymore.

42:03.688 --> 42:05.489
So I'm going to go.

42:05.523 --> 42:07.358
I don't accept that.

42:07.391 --> 42:10.327
You have to.

42:10.360 --> 42:11.963
Look.

42:14.800 --> 42:18.168
There's got to be some way
we can still see each other.

42:18.202 --> 42:19.436
There is.

42:24.041 --> 42:26.711
Tell me that you don't love me.

42:43.661 --> 42:46.097
*

43:15.793 --> 43:18.195
*

43:45.623 --> 43:48.025
*

43:50.829 --> 43:55.199
SPIKE (singing with radio):
* I plan each charted course

43:55.233 --> 43:57.702
* Each little step

43:57.735 --> 44:01.206
* Along the highway

44:01.239 --> 44:05.710
* And more,
much more than this *

44:05.744 --> 44:09.447
* I did it my

44:09.480 --> 44:11.849
* Way!

44:46.284 --> 44:48.686
Grr. Argh.
