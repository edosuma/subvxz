Mesrine: Part 1 - Death Instinct

05:00.669 --> 05:04.338
I was born maybe a half mile from here.

05:22.143 --> 05:24.017
Go ahead, go.

05:24.018 --> 05:26.624

<i>Algeria, 1959.</i>

05:57.307 --> 06:00.037
- I can't...
- Everything will be alright, brother.

06:00.038 --> 06:05.112
Look at me, everything will be fine.
Think about your family.

06:06.901 --> 06:12.597
Look at me.
Where is the bomb?

06:17.098 --> 06:19.069
God won't help you.

06:21.194 --> 06:26.246
- Stop! Let him go!
- Mind your own shit!

06:26.247 --> 06:30.302
- Mesrine!
- I am gonna shake him up.

06:33.577 --> 06:35.762
Talk...

06:35.763 --> 06:37.714
Look at your brother.

06:39.140 --> 06:40.947
Do you want a cigarette?

06:40.948 --> 06:44.702
Don't tell them anything, they'll kill you anyway.

06:44.703 --> 06:48.611
I like you, tell me
where is the bomb at?

06:48.612 --> 06:51.430
Nobody has to suffer.

06:52.376 --> 06:56.163
I tell you everything.

06:56.164 --> 06:57.726
Don't tell them anything!

07:01.007 --> 07:02.027
Jasmin!

07:02.627 --> 07:05.374
- Where is the bomb?
- Say nothing!

07:05.375 --> 07:09.378
- Don't tell them!
- Shut her hole!

07:09.379 --> 07:11.945
Leave her alone! That's my sister!

07:11.946 --> 07:15.891
<i>Stop!
Leave her alone!</i>

07:17.841 --> 07:20.219
I play with her for a little bit.

07:24.170 --> 07:27.807
Stop!
I kill you!

07:37.990 --> 07:40.962
Kill them!

07:51.904 --> 07:54.304
Shoot!

07:58.663 --> 08:04.175
It's your duty!

08:10.295 --> 08:12.747
No!

08:15.264 --> 08:18.447
Where did you hide the bomb, you bastards?!

09:52.912 --> 09:55.394
Father found you a job.

09:56.983 --> 09:59.216
- Really?
Yes.

09:59.217 --> 10:05.083
- At the factory.
Steelmill?  - Yes, right there.

- It was a piece of cake.

11:02.105 --> 11:07.456
- How was Algeria?
- Good. I don't feel like talking about it.

11:07.457 --> 11:12.769
- You have a nice ride. I see you're doing fine.
- I'm not complaining.

11:12.770 --> 11:15.390
I'm doing some work, you know. It's good money.

11:15.400 --> 11:18.091

- I'll tell you  everything about it.

11:20.001 --> 11:23.141

- I asked where we are going?

11:43.070 --> 11:46.865

12:40.811 --> 12:46.159
- Are you in it for the money only?
- Yeah, only when i get paid.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.510

- Paul told me a lot about you.
Thanks.  - Sit down.

17:10.885 --> 17:15.598
When are you going to stop bringing me these
wandering dogs from the streets?

17:15.599 --> 17:19.549
- It's not...
- Are you talking about me?
- No, not you.

17:19.550 --> 17:22.582

- And i asked you too, grandpa!

17:22.583 --> 17:25.125

17:25.126 --> 17:27.865
What's pissing you off?

17:31.139 --> 17:38.159
- I hope you have a big army behind you.
- My army is secret organization.

17:38.160 --> 17:42.361
Everybody recognize it
and it attacks whenever it wants to.

17:44.825 --> 17:46.351
You are just bragging, you old babbler.

17:47.052 --> 17:49.283
- If you don't know how to socialize
with older people, you shithead,

17:49.328 --> 17:50.883
then i will have to teach you some manners.

17:50.884 --> 17:53.983
And what else would you like?

17:58.639 --> 18:00.913
Are you looking for this?

18:03.589 --> 18:07.364
That's what happens when you hug old people.

18:09.668 --> 18:14.056
- Where is you respect?
- Okay, calm down.

18:23.283 --> 18:26.276
Don't be afraid I'm not a sociopath.

18:27.920 --> 18:31.632
- Yes.
- I see you're not dumb.

18:31.633 --> 18:34.410
I give you an advice,

18:34.411 --> 18:38.212
the kind you'll only get from a friend.

18:38.213 --> 18:44.201
In our bussiness you can't win.
At the end of your career if you lucky...

18:44.202 --> 18:45.943
you'll get this.

18:45.944 --> 18:50.178
If you get out of  water dry...
Are you following me?

18:51.428 --> 18:53.863
Thanks.

18:53.864 --> 18:56.275
I take your advice to my heart.

18:57.966 --> 19:01.598
If you really consider me as a friend,

19:01.599 --> 19:04.986
call me Jacques.

19:04.987 --> 19:07.973
Of course Jacques, sure.

19:19.975 --> 19:25.137
My Jacques. My lovely Jacques.

19:25.738 --> 19:27.953
Do you wanna do it again?

19:27.954 --> 19:32.776
I have a friend, but... if you'll pay me,
i'll work for you.

19:34.691 --> 19:37.516
Have you lost your mind?
What are you blabbing about?

19:37.517 --> 19:41.150
Who do you think i am?
Some sucker?

19:41.151 --> 19:45.715
I don't need your services.
I'll manage without you.

19:49.651 --> 19:52.154
Don't be so pissed.

19:54.373 --> 19:57.610
- I like you, Sarah
- I like you too.

19:57.611 --> 20:00.858
You must be careful how you talk to me.

20:03.253 --> 20:05.095
Hi.

20:09.110 --> 20:11.469
- Your boss called.
- What did he want?

20:11.470 --> 20:14.022
He said you didn't come to work for a week.

20:14.023 --> 20:15.895
- And what?
- What "what"?

20:15.896 --> 20:19.292
Father have found you a good job
and that's the way you pay him back?

20:19.293 --> 20:21.395
So what. What's your problem?

20:21.396 --> 20:24.102
Leave me alone!

20:24.103 --> 20:28.373
<i>Good man earns for his livelihood honestly!</i>

20:28.374 --> 20:32.467
<i>Keeps his family together and has a respect for them.</i>

20:37.014 --> 20:39.186
<i>Talk to your son!</i>

21:13.436 --> 21:17.698
You know, Me and your mom, we don't want you to leave.

21:17.699 --> 21:19.794
It's your house.

21:22.087 --> 21:26.525
Your mom, your mom...

21:26.526 --> 21:30.160
Speak for yourself for once.

21:30.161 --> 21:32.675
What's going on with you, Jacqui?

21:32.676 --> 21:36.865
Jacques is tired of his father being henpecked.

21:38.420 --> 21:42.831
And i am ashamed how you
collaborated with germans.

21:42.832 --> 21:49.787
And one more thing, tell me one reason
why i should be proud of my father.

21:49.788 --> 21:52.280
No, i didn't work for germans.

21:52.281 --> 21:56.288
- I was forced to.
- Nobody forced you, dad!

21:56.289 --> 21:59.283
The same way nobody forced me to go to Algeria!

21:59.284 --> 22:03.372
My god, just tell me what's going on with you.

22:03.373 --> 22:05.758
Do you have any pride?

22:16.111 --> 22:18.738
Spain, 1960.

22:30.016 --> 22:33.271
- It's nice here.
- I wouldn't lie to you.

27:10.533 --> 27:14.284

- Yes.

27:14.285 --> 27:19.260
Sofia...

27:53.059 --> 27:55.918

We got to go.
Move a bit faster.

28:20.751 --> 28:23.088
Get in.

28:24.468 --> 28:26.490
We're leaving.

Bye!

28:41.371 --> 28:44.103
What can you do in weather like this?

28:44.104 --> 28:47.088
Weather is not bothering me,
I work where it doesn't matter.

28:50.296 --> 28:53.800
- What do you need the gun for?
- You don't carry the gun?

28:53.801 --> 28:59.683

Sarah is taken, but Mado is free.

29:30.305 --> 29:32.469
Go!

29:32.470 --> 29:36.443
I wouldn't take this one.

29:36.444 --> 29:39.576
- Gentlemen, would you buy a lady a drink?
- Get lost!

29:39.577 --> 29:43.123
- What if you'd show some respect for the lady?
- Beat it! Get lost!

29:43.124 --> 29:48.521
What's that about?
Are you serving faggots in your bar?

29:48.822 --> 29:50.022
I told you to get lost!

29:53.244 --> 29:54.856
Hey, you!

29:54.857 --> 29:57.831
What kind of manners are these?

29:59.497 --> 30:02.651
What's wrong?
Anyone else wants some too? Huh?

30:07.368 --> 30:10.696
Jacques, What are you doing here?

30:10.697 --> 30:13.081
Leave him alone!

30:13.082 --> 30:17.342
- My poor boy. - What are you doing?
- Have you lost your mind?

30:18.719 --> 30:23.404
- Are selling yourself because of him?
Yeah. And you got a problem with it? He's my friend, ok?

30:24.488 --> 30:27.616
You snake! Get out of here!
I didn't ask you for anything!

30:27.617 --> 30:31.271
- My love.

30:33.100 --> 30:36.188
- I'm so sorry.
- Sweet couple.

30:36.992 --> 30:38.880
Get out of here!

30:41.494 --> 30:42.912
Get out!

30:57.211 --> 30:59.700
I'm sorry, Sarah.

31:12.526 --> 31:15.799
God!

31:45.318 --> 31:47.191
Sit in back.

32:13.097 --> 32:15.217
Your nose got bigger.

32:16.892 --> 32:22.219
It's nothing.
And how's Sarah, is she alive?

32:26.159 --> 32:32.205
Listen Jacques, i've made an agreement with Guido.
I let you have her.

32:35.183 --> 32:40.108
I fixed her smile a little bit .

32:48.349 --> 32:55.044
Ahmed, that's nice suit.

32:55.045 --> 32:58.737
- It's a classic. Isn't it Guido?
- A classic suit.

32:58.738 --> 33:03.495
- Is excellent. - Oh, yeah.
- I look in it like a real frenchman.

33:05.490 --> 33:07.970
Frenchman?

33:10.807 --> 33:14.067
You know how they call an Arab in suit like this?

33:15.041 --> 33:18.278
- Do you know it, Guido?
- No, I don't know.

33:18.279 --> 33:22.380
They say, "defendant , stand up!"

33:29.721 --> 33:31.901
good joke.

33:31.902 --> 33:36.607
Jacques, do you know what they call Arab in ashtray?

33:36.608 --> 33:38.575
No.

33:38.576 --> 33:41.440
A wastefulness. Three of them would fit in it.

33:54.985 --> 33:57.008
Good joke.

33:57.009 --> 34:02.052
- We're just joking.
- Don't be afraid.

34:03.716 --> 34:07.033
- We are not like that.
- No, we are not.

34:41.884 --> 34:45.725
You son of bitch.
I spit on people like you!

34:45.726 --> 34:51.139
Guido,  i gave you a word of a man.
I promised you!

34:51.141 --> 34:54.237
- Your arab word is worth a shit!
- Shut up!

34:54.237 --> 34:57.708
Shut up!

34:57.709 --> 35:04.036
- Come here so i can see you better.
- Look, he whiffs like girl. - Shut your hole!

35:07.308 --> 35:13.581
I would put bullet in a man's head,
but an animal like you, i finish off with knife!

35:14.792 --> 35:19.758
Did you want to sell Sarah!
For how much?

35:42.231 --> 35:44.844
Die you asshole!

36:48.080 --> 36:50.289
Well, what you got?
Flesh.

36:50.290 --> 36:54.030
- What's that?
- That's not important.

36:54.031 --> 36:57.713
- Jacques, did you get married?
- Yes, I did.

36:58.131 --> 37:00.013
- Are you married?
- I am.

37:00.014 --> 37:04.171
Heard that, Guido?
He got married.

37:04.172 --> 37:10.616
- She's pregnant.
- He got married because she is pregnant. Bravo.

37:12.705 --> 37:16.003
Enough.

37:16.004 --> 37:20.022
Hey, are you gonna serve me finally?
Pour drinks! Bitch!

37:20.023 --> 37:24.134
Move your ass! What are you doing?
Pour drinks!

37:24.135 --> 37:27.811
Hey, guys, what's the problem?

37:28.958 --> 37:31.852
And who are you?
Son of this bitch or the owner?

37:31.853 --> 37:34.277
Please, serve them.

37:35.716 --> 37:38.812
move your ass!

37:40.854 --> 37:43.102
Well, you see.

37:56.210 --> 37:59.609
Nothing's happening. Keep playing.
Everything is okay.

38:02.181 --> 38:07.121
This for disrespect
and this for your drinks.

38:12.946 --> 38:16.370
- Does it always take so long?
- Depends.

38:16.371 --> 38:19.880
- 8-10 hours, depends.
- That long?

38:19.881 --> 38:22.288
Depends, maybe even longer.

38:38.477 --> 38:42.060
- When you become father, maybe you'll settle down.
- Maybe.

38:42.061 --> 38:45.823
Lot of things change with time but me.

38:45.824 --> 38:48.826
- Only a few people change.
- It's true.

38:48.827 --> 38:54.044
- Do you remember Skazatov?  - Who is he?
- You shot him in his knees, that guy.

38:54.045 --> 38:57.520
Oh, Skazatov, i remember.

38:59.379 --> 39:02.223
And what about him?

39:02.224 --> 39:07.910
A couple days ago he came with two buddies and was asking about you.

39:07.911 --> 39:11.278
Were they tough guys?

39:12.634 --> 39:15.701
Yes they were.

39:15.702 --> 39:21.362
But without my approval they won't do anything to you.

39:21.363 --> 39:27.564
Really? So it's cool.

39:31.261 --> 39:33.629
What are they doing over there?

39:34.597 --> 39:37.159
A child.

39:39.510 --> 39:43.461
- Mister Mesrine?
- It's me. Guido, finally.

39:45.607 --> 39:47.908
You have a beautiful daughter.

39:50.553 --> 39:52.781
You the man.

39:52.782 --> 39:56.159
- How are you?
- She's beautiful.

40:06.604 --> 40:09.180
Hi.

40:23.712 --> 40:25.238
What happened?

40:27.516 --> 40:33.506
- Were you out with buddies and whores?
- Yeah, you're right.

40:35.339 --> 40:37.058
Wait.

40:38.650 --> 40:42.908
Let me finish it.
Yeah, i was with my buddies.

40:42.909 --> 40:46.876
- How about whores?
- Whores?

40:46.877 --> 40:47.877
Whores.

40:50.021 --> 40:52.951
why would i need whores when i have a woman like you?

41:18.022 --> 41:23.156
That bank looks great. Only two tellers work there,
but most importantly there's no safe.

41:23.157 --> 41:26.465
These morons keep money
under regular lock.

41:26.466 --> 41:29.517
Jacques, it's a walk in the park.

41:29.518 --> 41:32.639
- And you don't want to do it?
- No.

41:32.640 --> 41:35.019
- Why?
- Because i'm going with Guido.

41:35.020 --> 41:40.233
- I don't have any choice and you know that.
- That bank can be easily robbed.

41:40.234 --> 41:42.997
Get in, get out, the same way bunnies fuck.

41:44.564 --> 41:48.670
- Yeah, as long as bunnies won't get fucked by someone else.
- Yeah.

41:53.337 --> 41:57.211
To bunnies!
I do it!

41:58.323 --> 42:02.403
<i>Prison dÂ´Evreux, 1962.</i>

42:57.999 --> 43:01.538
- How are you?
- Dad.

43:01.539 --> 43:04.815
Did she say "dad"?

43:06.343 --> 43:10.656
My little girl. Dad.

43:10.657 --> 43:16.426
She said it.
I'm dad.

43:16.427 --> 43:19.103
Your daddy.

43:19.104 --> 43:22.287
She said it for the first time.

43:25.041 --> 43:27.582
Jacques...

43:27.583 --> 43:31.593
I don't know what to do.

43:31.594 --> 43:37.805
- What do you mean?
- I phoned your parents and they said...

43:39.710 --> 43:42.924
i should go back to Spain.

43:42.925 --> 43:46.249
What kinda crap is this? Is this why you came here?

43:46.250 --> 43:49.250
To look at me and tell me you're taking my daughter away from me?

43:51.911 --> 43:58.351
Sofia, look at me.

43:58.352 --> 44:01.789
Do you want to tell me that?

44:04.677 --> 44:09.134
I love you...

44:11.423 --> 44:13.413
...you're my wife.

44:13.414 --> 44:16.600
I need you a lot.

44:16.601 --> 44:20.705
Phone my parents,
they'll help you out. Sofia...

44:22.026 --> 44:24.458
For them you're like their own daughter.

44:26.253 --> 44:29.336
- Will you phone them?
- Yes, I will.

44:33.473 --> 44:37.155
This is my mom. Mom.

44:37.156 --> 44:40.225
She's a beauty your mom.

44:44.720 --> 44:53.463
I just got out of jail. I'm not ashamed to say
i was there for robberies.

44:55.130 --> 44:57.409
And the reason I don't have any references
it's simply because...

44:57.410 --> 45:00.400
my life was on the edge since i came back from army.

45:00.410 --> 45:04.298
And right here I'd like to  start fresh from zero.

45:06.001 --> 45:11.422
I'm doing this because of my parents, my wife
and of course for myself.

45:11.623 --> 45:13.770
But most importantly for little daughter because...

45:13.771 --> 45:15.571
... i have a little a daughter.

45:16.671 --> 45:20.949
You know, your past is not helping you.

45:20.950 --> 45:25.381
But at the same time i feel your honesty.

45:27.146 --> 45:30.976
You can start work tomorrow.

45:30.977 --> 45:35.017
- Really?
Yes.  - Thank you.

45:35.018 --> 45:37.605
- I'll show you where you'll work.
- Sure.

45:37.606 --> 45:40.805
This way, please.

45:40.806 --> 45:44.041
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

45:45.674 --> 45:49.128
Jacques, your little Bruno is a cutie.
Doesn't he cry during the night?

45:49.129 --> 45:53.214
Only rarely, but that's pretty normal.

45:53.215 --> 45:56.867
- Does he cry?
No. - You're sweet.

45:56.868 --> 46:02.405
- Just wait when his teeth start coming out...
- Anyway, we'll see.

46:02.406 --> 46:07.231
- I adore kus-kus.
- You know what, you should open a restaurant.

46:07.232 --> 46:11.580
- You're good cook.
- Besides, he already has a job with a good pay.

46:11.581 --> 46:15.856
- We don't miss anything.
- Don't get excited.

46:15.857 --> 46:19.749
Sofia, come to me, honey.

46:23.748 --> 46:26.495
- Good night.
Good night.  - Bye, bye.

46:29.115 --> 46:37.520
I have a job for you.
You wanna make some money?

46:37.521 --> 46:39.840
No, i don't.

46:39.841 --> 46:42.666
- No?
- No, i don't want to.

46:42.667 --> 46:47.219
Because of Sabrine and Bruno.
I live and support myself honestly.

46:47.220 --> 46:51.591
Alright we'll discuss it any other time.

46:53.106 --> 46:55.359
Let me know.

47:01.501 --> 47:03.951
- Jacques, you got a minute?
- Yeah, i do.

47:03.952 --> 47:09.436
- I have serious problems.
- Like what?

47:09.437 --> 47:12.228
I'll have to fire somebody.

47:12.229 --> 47:15.859
- But above all...
- I get it.

47:16.960 --> 47:19.136
- Wait...
- It's alright.

47:19.137 --> 47:23.825
- Last one to come, first one to go.
- I haven't decided yet.

47:23.826 --> 47:29.153
- Don't make anything out of it, you're good man.
- Don't worry because of me.

47:37.042 --> 47:41.060
- So, i'm ready.
Let's go.   - Jacques?

47:43.061 --> 47:45.445
- Jacques, where are you going?
- Everything's ok. I'm going out with my buddies.

47:45.446 --> 47:49.348
What buddies?
You said you're done with it.

47:49.349 --> 47:53.610
- Listen to me!
- You listen to me! I don't have time for this now.

47:53.611 --> 47:56.417
- You promised me that you won't hang out with them anymore.
- That's history.

47:56.418 --> 47:59.352
Go back to them and
that whore too!

47:59.353 --> 48:02.282
- And what's bothering you?
- Why can't you just stay home?

48:02.283 --> 48:05.159
This is the home of my parents!
I lost my job!

48:05.160 --> 48:09.402
- I don't care whose home is it!
- Quiet! You wake up Bruno!

48:09.403 --> 48:12.635
If you leave, I'll call cops!

48:17.456 --> 48:20.474
What did you say?

48:20.475 --> 48:23.348
Say it again! Repeat what you just said!

48:24.645 --> 48:28.540
Don't you ever say these words again, ok?

48:34.980 --> 48:40.760
- Come here! Open the mouth!
- So, kill me!  - Open your mouth!

48:46.762 --> 48:53.101
If i should choose between my
buddies and you, i'd choose them.

48:53.102 --> 48:55.842
Remember that.

48:55.843 --> 48:58.551
Mom!

49:03.912 --> 49:07.097
Take care of daughter.

49:15.582 --> 49:20.662
Fat Guido.
You think i can't recognize you through the mask?

49:24.852 --> 49:27.775
You're ridiculous.

49:27.776 --> 49:31.035
- Yeah, sure.
- The guy you're getting these papers for...

49:31.336 --> 49:32.836
is already dead.

49:33.036 --> 49:36.434
- You asshole.
Looser. - Shut up!

49:36.435 --> 49:38.604
Who sent you?

49:38.605 --> 49:41.115
- Chevallier?
- Shut up!

49:41.116 --> 49:43.317
This is your end.
You're finished.

49:43.318 --> 49:45.878
You've reached your goal.

49:47.277 --> 49:49.617
I found them.

49:54.895 --> 49:59.173
- Why did you do it?
Mind your own shit. Any other questions?

49:59.174 --> 50:03.394
- You killed unarmed man!
- Do you recall how you put the gun in your wife's mouth.

50:03.395 --> 50:05.383
That's something different.

50:07.026 --> 50:09.154
I break.

50:11.416 --> 50:15.916
- Do you bet more or you wanna take a break?
- Time, time, time...

50:17.938 --> 50:21.728
You don't need me to give you an advice.
You'll figure it out yourself.

50:32.530 --> 50:35.861
- Here!
- Why are you throwing away your wedding ring?

50:35.862 --> 50:39.549
- She has abandoned us. Me and three kids.
- What?

50:39.550 --> 50:41.736
Yeah.

50:43.809 --> 50:46.928
- Really?
Yeah.   - Good.

50:46.929 --> 50:51.258
You think this is more than three?

50:51.259 --> 50:53.947
Doesn't matter. Fuck Sofia.

50:55.565 --> 51:03.388
So, Who is the best?
Your friend Paul won everything.

51:43.527 --> 51:48.602
- Handsome, are you gonna buy me a drink?
He can't, he's here with me.

51:50.062 --> 51:52.003
okay then.

52:05.965 --> 52:07.909
Thanks.

52:09.057 --> 52:12.711
- What's your name?
- Jeanne.

52:12.712 --> 52:17.150
Jeanne? Funny.
And I am Tarzan.

52:21.577 --> 52:26.896
- My real name is Jacques.
- My pleasure Jacques.

52:26.897 --> 52:31.838
- What do you want to drink?
- I thought it's customary for a gentleman to ask this question.

52:31.839 --> 52:34.686
Traditions need to be changed.

52:34.687 --> 52:39.186
- I try. I'm ready for everything.
- Me too.

52:40.790 --> 52:42.918
Really?

52:42.919 --> 52:45.306
Yes.

52:49.225 --> 52:52.266
- Quiet! Nobody moves!
- Everybody put your hands on the table!

52:52.267 --> 52:56.821
- Quickly, all of you hands on the table!
- I said, hands on the table!

52:56.822 --> 53:00.124
Hey, calm her down!

53:00.125 --> 53:03.995
Move, hurry, hurry!

53:05.713 --> 53:07.787
What's your problem?!

53:11.203 --> 53:13.357
- I said, quiet!
- Quiet!

53:14.566 --> 53:16.534
- Quick, move!
- Jacques...

53:17.806 --> 53:20.212
- now you're stealing from me?
Do you have a problem with it?

53:20.213 --> 53:26.115
- You won't get too far.
- Don't worry about me.

53:27.333 --> 53:29.455
I have what i want.

53:30.852 --> 53:33.688
Here is a tip.

53:41.910 --> 53:45.169
- Dad, why isn't it working?
Sweetie,

53:45.170 --> 53:49.132
because the ball and the racket must be this way.

54:05.068 --> 54:09.263
- Are you alright?
Dad, does it hurt? - No, it's nothing, honey.

54:09.264 --> 54:11.941
I'm only injured.

54:12.264 --> 54:14.741
- I love you dad.
- I love you too.

54:23.870 --> 54:27.002
In front of my daughter!
What the hell is it!

54:27.525 --> 54:31.145
Will you stay together? Do you still want
to be with him?

54:31.146 --> 54:34.314
- To the end.
Yes, of course.

54:35.240 --> 54:40.705
If you love this woman, run away with her
and come back when everything settles down.

54:40.706 --> 54:43.379
Do you really mean it?

54:43.380 --> 54:46.835
You think they won't go after us once we cross the border?

54:46.836 --> 54:51.730
The police is trying to get you,
i won't help you with that.

54:51.731 --> 54:55.053
Yeah, but they were shooting at my daughter!
I guess there are some rules!

54:55.054 --> 55:00.839
What rules?! In this bussiness
there's only one rule, rule of the jungle.

55:00.840 --> 55:03.743
Everything has principles and moral laws.

55:03.744 --> 55:07.546
Get ready.
It will hurt.

55:18.882 --> 55:21.318
Don't twist, I almost had her.

55:23.401 --> 55:25.121
Guido!

55:28.281 --> 55:32.043
Remember in the future,
this is being used for killing people!

55:33.906 --> 55:35.814
Good.

55:51.276 --> 55:53.521
Let me, i'll help you out.

55:53.522 --> 55:56.455
Bye mom.

55:56.456 --> 56:01.021
- Come to me.
- Bye dad.

56:02.422 --> 56:05.893
- My love.

You're doing pretty good for a Frenchman.

57:45.547 --> 57:48.784
It seems you are not from around here.

You have 10 days to leave Canadian territory.

59:04.161 --> 59:05.811
Dear.

59:05.812 --> 59:08.148
How did it go at the immigration?

59:10.011 --> 59:14.369
Good, but we need more time.

59:14.370 --> 59:19.217
Next week you don't have to go back to construction job.

59:19.218 --> 59:22.742
- Why?
- I replied  to an ad from some millionaire.

59:22.743 --> 59:25.743
He's looking for a driver.
We'll go for an interview.

59:27.392 --> 59:31.101

My guardian angels.

01:00:12.459 --> 01:00:18.301
- I suppose that we are hired.
- And you have my blessing too, my son.

01:00:18.302 --> 01:00:23.243
So in that case, thanks dad.

Let's go
one, two and three.

01:00:43.723 --> 01:00:45.197
Are you alright?

01:00:45.198 --> 01:00:47.509
Slowly.

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:49.834
We are not in a hurry.

01:00:51.108 --> 01:00:53.771
Don't worry, i'm holding you.

01:00:55.826 --> 01:00:57.563
So where to, sir?

01:00:57.564 --> 01:01:00.438
- to Santlar street.
- Sure.

01:01:18.162 --> 01:01:20.074
Hello sir.

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:25.917
- Have you paid for the parking?
- I live here, here is my card.
- Good then, take care.

01:01:44.964 --> 01:01:46.215
Look.

01:01:46.216 --> 01:01:49.554
- This is from Jacques.
- From Jacques?

01:02:26.201 --> 01:02:29.517
I'm telling you for the first and  the last time,
stop mingling in to my work.

01:02:29.518 --> 01:02:32.848
- I don't want to see you here anymore!
- What? Are you going to complain?

01:02:32.928 --> 01:02:34.848
I've been working here for more than 20 years!

01:02:34.849 --> 01:02:37.511
Just go!

01:02:37.512 --> 01:02:41.695
- You'll see, you won't get out of this that easily!
- Go, just go!

01:02:42.324 --> 01:02:44.545
That's okay.

01:02:55.386 --> 01:02:58.314
My gardener gave me a notice.

01:02:58.315 --> 01:03:04.442
You talked to him with disrespect.
The whole altercation was provoked by you.

01:03:04.443 --> 01:03:07.298
- That guy is just a nobody.
- Maybe he is,

01:03:07.299 --> 01:03:11.641
but he served me loyally for 20 years.

01:03:11.642 --> 01:03:14.585
And I only knew you for three months,

01:03:14.586 --> 01:03:19.124
so with less regret i rather say goodbye to you.

01:03:19.125 --> 01:03:23.483
- I'm giving two days to leave this house.
- Sure. Come, we're leaving.

01:04:05.072 --> 01:04:08.139
<i>Jacques, we have to talk!</i>

01:04:13.198 --> 01:04:15.371
<i>Jacques!</i>

01:04:17.205 --> 01:04:19.873
<i>- Jacquesi!
- Damn!</i>

01:04:22.195 --> 01:04:23.879
What?! What!

01:04:26.131 --> 01:04:31.309
- Why are you treating me like this?
For disrespecting me, Georges.

01:04:31.310 --> 01:04:35.068
- and for disrespecting my wife.
- Tell me...

01:04:36.354 --> 01:04:38.295
what do you intend to do with me?

01:04:38.296 --> 01:04:43.169
- Jacques?!
- What? At first, you've been so nice to us,

01:04:43.170 --> 01:04:47.230
and then because of that idiot gardener,
you fired us!

01:04:47.231 --> 01:04:49.626
Are we some kind of scum?

01:04:50.786 --> 01:04:55.150
You'll pay for this.
I'll teach you some respect!

01:04:55.151 --> 01:04:58.416
- My brother will pay you.
- It's possible.

01:04:59.310 --> 01:05:03.363
In the meanwhile let me watch the TV!

01:05:47.574 --> 01:05:51.251
Jacques!

01:06:27.355 --> 01:06:29.122
Help!

01:06:33.454 --> 01:06:37.065
- Hi  Jacques. This is Jean-Paul.
- What's up?
- I don't think he'll come.

01:06:37.066 --> 01:06:40.390
We'll see about that.
I'm done talking!

01:06:46.125 --> 01:06:48.889
He thinks, he is gonna pull my leg.

01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:52.909
That old fart didn't show up with the money!
He'll pay, you'll see Jeanne.

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:26.171
That's him.

01:07:32.736 --> 01:07:34.715
Shit!

01:08:33.926 --> 01:08:36.643
- What are we going to do, Jacques?  Look.
- Shit!

01:08:39.689 --> 01:08:42.228
I have to stop.

01:08:43.001 --> 01:08:45.020
Fine, stop.

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:48.100
Get ready!

01:09:07.015 --> 01:09:09.675
No. It's too many of them.

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:57.103

It doesn't matter what. Anything.

Welcome at the prison with maximum security.

Forget about it, Frenchman.

01:17:22.453 --> 01:17:25.711
I've seen you on TV.

Long live Quebec, right?

01:17:32.290 --> 01:17:35.252
You think you can get through barb wire?

01:17:38.498 --> 01:17:43.544
Your friend Mercier is right there
where you've been tortured by Gottier.

01:17:47.562 --> 01:17:51.508
- How is he?
- How could he be, he's barely alive.

01:17:55.510 --> 01:17:59.541
See you soon, French.

01:17:59.576 --> 01:18:02.671
By the way, you looked more happier on TV.

01:19:12.219 --> 01:19:14.578
Hey!

01:19:17.438 --> 01:19:20.119
- Nice to see you again.
- You too.

Hey, hold on.
They're watching.

- Here you go.
- Thanks.

Do you know these two?

01:19:52.058 --> 01:19:55.556
- Which ones?
- The fat one with buddy.

01:19:57.136 --> 01:20:00.643
That fat one is murderer.

01:20:00.644 --> 01:20:05.442
The other one, too.
He's suspected of killing the guard.

01:20:08.604 --> 01:20:10.268
Why? Are they causing problems for you?

01:20:11.804 --> 01:20:13.800
Right now, i don't know.

01:20:15.252 --> 01:20:19.351
I think I know how we'll escape from here.

01:20:19.352 --> 01:20:22.299
We'll get through the fence.

01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:25.442
During our walk in daylight?

01:20:27.651 --> 01:20:29.819
Do you have any other ideas?

01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:34.378
Good, Jacques.
When?

01:20:36.971 --> 01:20:40.246
By the fall you'll be either outside or
you'll be dead.

01:20:41.746 --> 01:20:45.357
I'm for it. Death or freedom.

01:21:19.818 --> 01:21:22.981
Tell me honestly.
What do you want from me, Frenchman?

01:21:22.982 --> 01:21:29.220
- I need tools.
- What's in it for me?

01:21:30.652 --> 01:21:33.179
I don't have anything to offer you.

01:21:33.180 --> 01:21:35.811
Except a chance for freedom.

01:21:35.812 --> 01:21:39.938
If i'll manage to get out of here,
i'll take you with me. I'm giving you my word.

01:21:41.130 --> 01:21:44.051
You're desparate, Frenchman.
I like it.

- See you.

Did he agree?

01:21:53.670 --> 01:21:56.462
- What day is today?
- I know is monday.

01:22:06.497 --> 01:22:09.826
Jesus, Frenchman!
Do you want to get killed?!

01:22:14.179 --> 01:22:17.973
But not here and not on monday.

01:22:25.945 --> 01:22:29.857
They are always watching,
except on monday after weekend hangover.

01:24:28.844 --> 01:24:30.697
Mercier, let's go.

01:25:13.457 --> 01:25:15.782
- Are you looking out?
- Yeah.

01:25:40.181 --> 01:25:41.755
Hurry!

01:26:19.821 --> 01:26:21.498
Don't worry, everything is ok.

01:26:27.002 --> 01:26:29.468
Stop! Or i'll shoot!

01:27:08.838 --> 01:27:10.310
Come on, let's get out of here!

01:27:36.623 --> 01:27:39.157

Face to the ground!

- Jean-Paul!
- What?

01:28:10.824 --> 01:28:13.751
- They talk about us.
- Leave me alone right now!

- Jean-Paul!
Give me two minutes, damn!

01:28:42.026 --> 01:28:43.924
We're famous, Jean-Paul.

01:28:53.824 --> 01:28:57.418
Don't go out with your hands up
only if they'll capture both of us.

01:28:57.419 --> 01:28:59.687
They shoot at everybody, whoever moves.

01:29:01.677 --> 01:29:04.881
- We must be fast.
How much time do we have?

01:29:04.882 --> 01:29:06.982
30 seconds.

01:29:08.945 --> 01:29:10.767
Not enough?

01:29:13.746 --> 01:29:15.486
- Do we have a choice?
- No.

01:29:27.278 --> 01:29:29.501
I wanna see your hands!

01:29:29.502 --> 01:29:32.331
Quick on the floor!

01:29:43.646 --> 01:29:46.255
Don't move and nothing happens to you!

01:29:47.928 --> 01:29:51.306
I'm telling you, don't move!

01:29:52.701 --> 01:29:54.652

01:29:54.653 --> 01:30:00.329

Thank you ladies and gentlemen.
Take care. Stay nicely on the floor.

01:30:21.451 --> 01:30:24.337
No, not yet. That one across the street too.

- What?
Let's go!

01:30:26.407 --> 01:30:28.207

01:33:11.325 --> 01:33:12.284
Now?

Not bad. It's ok.

No, nothing is fine.
As soon as i'll get better,

01:37:42.549 --> 01:37:45.016
i'll be there right away.

01:37:46.213 --> 01:37:50.120
- No, don't organize anything.
What's going on with you, honey? Stop.

01:37:50.121 --> 01:37:54.349
Mercier is with me.
We're armed to the teeth.

01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:56.716
I'll come to get you.

01:37:56.717 --> 01:38:01.255
No, please don't do it.
Soon my jail time will be over.

01:38:01.256 --> 01:38:03.918
Hush, what are you talking about?

01:38:05.128 --> 01:38:09.432
I'll come to get you, my love.
We'll leave together and everything will stay behind us.

01:38:10.907 --> 01:38:14.788
Don't do it, Jacques.
I don't want you to come.

01:38:14.789 --> 01:38:18.200
- I'm asking you, please understand.
- I'll come to get you!

- I'll come! Stop!
- No, they know you'll come.

01:38:22.013 --> 01:38:25.360
They're waiting for you! They could kill you!

01:38:26.641 --> 01:38:28.381
They won't kill me, trust me.

01:38:28.382 --> 01:38:30.897
Soon, bye.

01:38:30.898 --> 01:38:33.861
Jacques, you must not come.

01:38:33.862 --> 01:38:38.733
I said i'll come and i really will do it, damn!

01:38:45.564 --> 01:38:48.702
- Did you hear me? I'll come.
No, Jacques...

01:38:52.099 --> 01:38:54.606
No...

01:38:56.260 --> 01:38:58.519
Calm down and be ready, you hear me?

Now try with the left hand.

01:40:20.418 --> 01:40:23.786
- Damn!
- It's harder now, isn't it?

01:40:23.787 --> 01:40:26.896
My hand is still weak.

01:40:35.730 --> 01:40:38.102
