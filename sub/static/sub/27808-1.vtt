Mesrine: Part 1 - Death Instinct

05:00.669 --> 05:04.338
I was born maybe a half mile from here.

05:22.143 --> 05:24.017
Go ahead, go.

05:24.018 --> 05:26.624

05:50.493 --> 05:53.705
<i>Algeria, 1959.</i>

05:57.307 --> 06:00.037
- I can't...
- Everything will be alright, brother.

06:00.038 --> 06:05.112
Look at me, everything will be fine.
Think about your family.

06:06.901 --> 06:12.597
Look at me.
Where is the bomb?

06:17.098 --> 06:19.069
God won't help you.

06:21.194 --> 06:26.246
- Stop! Let him go!
- Mind your own shit!

06:26.247 --> 06:30.302
- Mesrine!
- I am gonna shake him up.

06:33.577 --> 06:35.762
Talk...

06:35.763 --> 06:37.714
Look at your brother.

06:39.140 --> 06:40.947
Do you want a cigarette?

06:40.948 --> 06:44.702
Don't tell them anything, they'll kill you anyway.

06:44.703 --> 06:48.611
I like you, tell me
where is the bomb at?

06:48.612 --> 06:51.430
Nobody has to suffer.

06:52.376 --> 06:56.163
I tell you everything.

06:56.164 --> 06:57.726
Don't tell them anything!

07:01.007 --> 07:02.027
Jasmin!

07:02.627 --> 07:05.374
- Where is the bomb?
- Say nothing!

07:05.375 --> 07:09.378
- Don't tell them!
- Shut her hole!

07:09.379 --> 07:11.945
Leave her alone! That's my sister!

07:11.946 --> 07:15.891
<i>Stop!
Leave her alone!</i>

07:17.841 --> 07:20.219
I play with her for a little bit.

07:24.170 --> 07:27.807
Stop!
I kill you!

07:37.990 --> 07:40.962
Kill them!

07:51.904 --> 07:54.304
Shoot!

07:58.663 --> 08:04.175
It's your duty!

08:10.295 --> 08:12.747
No!

08:15.264 --> 08:18.447
Where did you hide the bomb, you bastards?!

09:52.912 --> 09:55.394
Father found you a job.

09:56.983 --> 09:59.216
- Really?
Yes.

09:59.217 --> 10:05.083
- At the factory.
Steelmill?  - Yes, right there.

- It was a piece of cake.

11:02.105 --> 11:07.456
- How was Algeria?
- Good. I don't feel like talking about it.

11:07.457 --> 11:12.769
- You have a nice ride. I see you're doing fine.
- I'm not complaining.

11:12.770 --> 11:15.390
I'm doing some work, you know. It's good money.

11:15.400 --> 11:18.091

- I'll tell you  everything about it.

11:20.001 --> 11:23.141

- I asked where we are going?

11:43.070 --> 11:46.865

12:40.811 --> 12:46.159
- Are you in it for the money only?
- Yeah, only when i get paid.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.510
You'll pay me.

12:48.911 --> 12:52.511

- Paul told me a lot about you.
Thanks.  - Sit down.

17:10.885 --> 17:15.598
When are you going to stop bringing me these
wandering dogs from the streets?

17:15.599 --> 17:19.549
- It's not...
- Are you talking about me?
- No, not you.

17:19.550 --> 17:22.582

- And i asked you too, grandpa!

17:22.583 --> 17:25.125

17:25.126 --> 17:27.865
What's pissing you off?

17:31.139 --> 17:38.159
- I hope you have a big army behind you.
- My army is secret organization.

17:38.160 --> 17:42.361
Everybody recognize it
and it attacks whenever it wants to.

17:44.825 --> 17:46.351
You are just bragging, you old babbler.

17:47.052 --> 17:49.283
- If you don't know how to socialize
with older people, you shithead,

17:49.328 --> 17:50.883
then i will have to teach you some manners.

17:50.884 --> 17:53.983
And what else would you like?

17:58.639 --> 18:00.913
Are you looking for this?

18:03.589 --> 18:07.364
That's what happens when you hug old people.

18:09.668 --> 18:14.056
- Where is you respect?
- Okay, calm down.

18:23.283 --> 18:26.276
Don't be afraid I'm not a sociopath.

18:27.920 --> 18:31.632
- Yes.
- I see you're not dumb.

18:31.633 --> 18:34.410
I give you an advice,

18:34.411 --> 18:38.212
the kind you'll only get from a friend.

18:38.213 --> 18:44.201
In our bussiness you can't win.
At the end of your career if you lucky...

18:44.202 --> 18:45.943
you'll get this.

18:45.944 --> 18:50.178
If you get out of  water dry...
Are you following me?

18:51.428 --> 18:53.863
Thanks.

18:53.864 --> 18:56.275
I take your advice to my heart.

18:57.966 --> 19:01.598
If you really consider me as a friend,

19:01.599 --> 19:04.986
call me Jacques.

19:04.987 --> 19:07.973
Of course Jacques, sure.

19:19.975 --> 19:25.137
My Jacques. My lovely Jacques.

19:25.738 --> 19:27.953
Do you wanna do it again?

19:27.954 --> 19:32.776
I have a friend, but... if you'll pay me,
i'll work for you.

19:34.691 --> 19:37.516
Have you lost your mind?
What are you blabbing about?

19:37.517 --> 19:41.150
Who do you think i am?
Some sucker?

19:41.151 --> 19:45.715
I don't need your services.
I'll manage without you.

19:49.651 --> 19:52.154
Don't be so pissed.

19:54.373 --> 19:57.610
- I like you, Sarah
- I like you too.

19:57.611 --> 20:00.858
You must be careful how you talk to me.

20:03.253 --> 20:05.095
Hi.

20:09.110 --> 20:11.469
- Your boss called.
- What did he want?

20:11.470 --> 20:14.022
He said you didn't come to work for a week.

20:14.023 --> 20:15.895
- And what?
- What "what"?

20:15.896 --> 20:19.292
Father have found you a good job
and that's the way you pay him back?

20:19.293 --> 20:21.395
So what. What's your problem?

20:21.396 --> 20:24.102
Leave me alone!

20:24.103 --> 20:28.373
<i>Good man earns for his livelihood honestly!</i>

20:28.374 --> 20:32.467
<i>Keeps his family together and has a respect for them.</i>

20:37.014 --> 20:39.186
<i>Talk to your son!</i>

21:13.436 --> 21:17.698
You know, Me and your mom, we don't want you to leave.

21:17.699 --> 21:19.794
It's your house.

21:22.087 --> 21:26.525
Your mom, your mom...

21:26.526 --> 21:30.160
Speak for yourself for once.

21:30.161 --> 21:32.675
What's going on with you, Jacqui?

21:32.676 --> 21:36.865
Jacques is tired of his father being henpecked.

21:38.420 --> 21:42.831
And i am ashamed how you
collaborated with germans.

21:42.832 --> 21:49.787
And one more thing, tell me one reason
why i should be proud of my father.

21:49.788 --> 21:52.280
No, i didn't work for germans.

21:52.281 --> 21:56.288
- I was forced to.
- Nobody forced you, dad!

21:56.289 --> 21:59.283
The same way nobody forced me to go to Algeria!

21:59.284 --> 22:03.372
My god, just tell me what's going on with you.

22:03.373 --> 22:05.758
Do you have any pride?

22:16.111 --> 22:18.738
Spain, 1960.

22:30.016 --> 22:33.271
- It's nice here.
- I wouldn't lie to you.

25:57.587 --> 25:59.487

27:10.533 --> 27:14.284

- Yes.

27:14.285 --> 27:19.260
Sofia...

27:53.059 --> 27:55.918

We got to go.
Move a bit faster.

28:20.751 --> 28:23.088
Get in.

28:24.468 --> 28:26.490
We're leaving.

Bye!

28:41.371 --> 28:44.103
What can you do in weather like this?

28:44.104 --> 28:47.088
Weather is not bothering me,
I work where it doesn't matter.

28:50.296 --> 28:53.800
- What do you need the gun for?
- You don't carry the gun?

28:53.801 --> 28:59.683

Sarah is taken, but Mado is free.

29:30.305 --> 29:32.469
Go!

29:32.470 --> 29:36.443
I wouldn't take this one.

29:36.444 --> 29:39.576
- Gentlemen, would you buy a lady a drink?
- Get lost!

29:39.577 --> 29:43.123
- What if you'd show some respect for the lady?
- Beat it! Get lost!

29:43.124 --> 29:48.521
What's that about?
Are you serving faggots in your bar?

29:48.822 --> 29:50.022
I told you to get lost!

29:53.244 --> 29:54.856
Hey, you!

29:54.857 --> 29:57.831
What kind of manners are these?

29:59.497 --> 30:02.651
What's wrong?
Anyone else wants some too? Huh?

30:07.368 --> 30:10.696
Jacques, What are you doing here?

30:10.697 --> 30:13.081
Leave him alone!

30:13.082 --> 30:17.342
- My poor boy. - What are you doing?
- Have you lost your mind?

30:18.719 --> 30:23.404
- Are selling yourself because of him?
Yeah. And you got a problem with it? He's my friend, ok?

30:24.488 --> 30:27.616
You snake! Get out of here!
I didn't ask you for anything!

30:27.617 --> 30:31.271
- My love.

30:33.100 --> 30:36.188
- I'm so sorry.
- Sweet couple.

30:36.992 --> 30:38.880
Get out of here!

30:41.494 --> 30:42.912
Get out!

30:57.211 --> 30:59.700
I'm sorry, Sarah.

31:12.526 --> 31:15.799
God!

31:45.318 --> 31:47.191
Sit in back.

32:13.097 --> 32:15.217
Your nose got bigger.

32:16.892 --> 32:22.219
It's nothing.
And how's Sarah, is she alive?

32:26.159 --> 32:32.205
Listen Jacques, i've made an agreement with Guido.
I let you have her.

32:35.183 --> 32:40.108
I fixed her smile a little bit .

32:48.349 --> 32:55.044
Ahmed, that's nice suit.

32:55.045 --> 32:58.737
- It's a classic. Isn't it Guido?
- A classic suit.

32:58.738 --> 33:03.495
- Is excellent. - Oh, yeah.
- I look in it like a real frenchman.

33:05.490 --> 33:07.970
Frenchman?

33:10.807 --> 33:14.067
You know how they call an Arab in suit like this?

33:15.041 --> 33:18.278
- Do you know it, Guido?
- No, I don't know.

33:18.279 --> 33:22.380
They say, "defendant , stand up!"

33:29.721 --> 33:31.901
good joke.

33:31.902 --> 33:36.607
Jacques, do you know what they call Arab in ashtray?

33:36.608 --> 33:38.575
No.

33:38.576 --> 33:41.440
A wastefulness. Three of them would fit in it.

33:54.985 --> 33:57.008
Good joke.

33:57.009 --> 34:02.052
- We're just joking.
- Don't be afraid.

34:03.716 --> 34:07.033
- We are not like that.
- No, we are not.

34:41.884 --> 34:45.725
You son of bitch.
I spit on people like you!

34:45.726 --> 34:51.139
Guido,  i gave you a word of a man.
I promised you!

34:51.141 --> 34:54.237
- Your arab word is worth a shit!
- Shut up!

34:54.237 --> 34:57.708
Shut up!

34:57.709 --> 35:04.036
- Come here so i can see you better.
- Look, he whiffs like girl. - Shut your hole!

35:07.308 --> 35:13.581
I would put bullet in a man's head,
but an animal like you, i finish off with knife!

35:14.792 --> 35:19.758
Did you want to sell Sarah!
For how much?

35:42.231 --> 35:44.844
Die you asshole!

36:48.080 --> 36:50.289
Well, what you got?
Flesh.

36:50.290 --> 36:54.030
- What's that?
- That's not important.

36:54.031 --> 36:57.713
- Jacques, did you get married?
- Yes, I did.

36:58.131 --> 37:00.013
- Are you married?
- I am.

37:00.014 --> 37:04.171
Heard that, Guido?
He got married.

37:04.172 --> 37:10.616
- She's pregnant.
- He got married because she is pregnant. Bravo.

37:12.705 --> 37:16.003
Enough.

37:16.004 --> 37:20.022
Hey, are you gonna serve me finally?
Pour drinks! Bitch!

37:20.023 --> 37:24.134
Move your ass! What are you doing?
Pour drinks!

37:24.135 --> 37:27.811
Hey, guys, what's the problem?

37:28.958 --> 37:31.852
And who are you?
Son of this bitch or the owner?

37:31.853 --> 37:34.277
Please, serve them.

37:35.716 --> 37:38.812
move your ass!

37:40.854 --> 37:43.102
Well, you see.

37:56.210 --> 37:59.609
Nothing's happening. Keep playing.
Everything is okay.

38:02.181 --> 38:07.121
This for disrespect
and this for your drinks.

38:12.946 --> 38:16.370
- Does it always take so long?
- Depends.

38:16.371 --> 38:19.880
- 8-10 hours, depends.
- That long?

38:19.881 --> 38:22.288
Depends, maybe even longer.

38:38.477 --> 38:42.060
- When you become father, maybe you'll settle down.
- Maybe.

38:42.061 --> 38:45.823
Lot of things change with time but me.

38:45.824 --> 38:48.826
- Only a few people change.
- It's true.

38:48.827 --> 38:54.044
- Do you remember Skazatov?  - Who is he?
- You shot him in his knees, that guy.

38:54.045 --> 38:57.520
Oh, Skazatov, i remember.

38:59.379 --> 39:02.223
And what about him?

39:02.224 --> 39:07.910
A couple days ago he came with two buddies and was asking about you.

39:07.911 --> 39:11.278
Were they tough guys?

39:12.634 --> 39:15.701
Yes they were.

39:15.702 --> 39:21.362
But without my approval they won't do anything to you.

39:21.363 --> 39:27.564
Really? So it's cool.

39:31.261 --> 39:33.629
What are they doing over there?

39:34.597 --> 39:37.159
A child.

39:39.510 --> 39:43.461
- Mister Mesrine?
- It's me. Guido, finally.

39:45.607 --> 39:47.908
You have a beautiful daughter.

39:50.553 --> 39:52.781
You the man.

39:52.782 --> 39:56.159
- How are you?
- She's beautiful.

40:06.604 --> 40:09.180
Hi.

40:23.712 --> 40:25.238
What happened?

40:27.516 --> 40:33.506
- Were you out with buddies and whores?
- Yeah, you're right.

40:35.339 --> 40:37.058
Wait.

40:38.650 --> 40:42.908
Let me finish it.
Yeah, i was with my buddies.

40:42.909 --> 40:46.876
- How about whores?
- Whores?

40:46.877 --> 40:47.877
Whores.

40:50.021 --> 40:52.951
why would i need whores when i have a woman like you?

41:18.022 --> 41:23.156
That bank looks great. Only two tellers work there,
but most importantly there's no safe.

41:23.157 --> 41:26.465
These morons keep money
under regular lock.

41:26.466 --> 41:29.517
Jacques, it's a walk in the park.

41:29.518 --> 41:32.639
- And you don't want to do it?
- No.

41:32.640 --> 41:35.019
- Why?
- Because i'm going with Guido.

41:35.020 --> 41:40.233
- I don't have any choice and you know that.
- That bank can be easily robbed.

41:40.234 --> 41:42.997
Get in, get out, the same way bunnies fuck.

41:44.564 --> 41:48.670
- Yeah, as long as bunnies won't get fucked by someone else.
- Yeah.

41:53.337 --> 41:57.211
To bunnies!
I do it!

41:58.323 --> 42:02.403
<i>Prison d´Evreux, 1962.</i>

42:57.999 --> 43:01.538
- How are you?
- Dad.

43:01.539 --> 43:04.815
Did she say "dad"?

43:06.343 --> 43:10.656
My little girl. Dad.

43:10.657 --> 43:16.426
She said it.
I'm dad.

43:16.427 --> 43:19.103
Your daddy.

43:19.104 --> 43:22.287
She said it for the first time.

43:25.041 --> 43:27.582
Jacques...

43:27.583 --> 43:31.593
I don't know what to do.

43:31.594 --> 43:37.805
- What do you mean?
- I phoned your parents and they said...

43:39.710 --> 43:42.924
i should go back to Spain.

43:42.925 --> 43:46.249
What kinda crap is this? Is this why you came here?

43:46.250 --> 43:49.250
To look at me and tell me you're taking my daughter away from me?

43:51.911 --> 43:58.351
Sofia, look at me.

43:58.352 --> 44:01.789
Do you want to tell me that?

44:04.677 --> 44:09.134
I love you...

44:11.423 --> 44:13.413
...you're my wife.

44:13.414 --> 44:16.600
I need you a lot.

44:16.601 --> 44:20.705
Phone my parents,
they'll help you out. Sofia...

44:22.026 --> 44:24.458
For them you're like their own daughter.

44:26.253 --> 44:29.336
- Will you phone them?
- Yes, I will.

44:33.473 --> 44:37.155
This is my mom. Mom.

44:37.156 --> 44:40.225
She's a beauty your mom.

44:44.720 --> 44:53.463
I just got out of jail. I'm not ashamed to say
i was there for robberies.

44:55.130 --> 44:57.409
And the reason I don't have any references
it's simply because...

44:57.410 --> 45:00.400
my life was on the edge since i came back from army.

45:00.410 --> 45:04.298
And right here I'd like to  start fresh from zero.

45:06.001 --> 45:11.422
I'm doing this because of my parents, my wife
and of course for myself.

45:11.623 --> 45:13.770
But most importantly for little daughter because...

45:13.771 --> 45:15.571
... i have a little a daughter.

45:16.671 --> 45:20.949
You know, your past is not helping you.

45:20.950 --> 45:25.381
But at the same time i feel your honesty.

45:27.146 --> 45:30.976
You can start work tomorrow.

45:30.977 --> 45:35.017
- Really?
Yes.  - Thank you.

45:35.018 --> 45:37.605
- I'll show you where you'll work.
- Sure.

45:37.606 --> 45:40.805
This way, please.

45:40.806 --> 45:44.041
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

45:45.674 --> 45:49.128
Jacques, your little Bruno is a cutie.
Doesn't he cry during the night?

45:49.129 --> 45:53.214
Only rarely, but that's pretty normal.

45:53.215 --> 45:56.867
- Does he cry?
No. - You're sweet.

45:56.868 --> 46:02.405
- Just wait when his teeth start coming out...
- Anyway, we'll see.

46:02.406 --> 46:07.231
- I adore kus-kus.
- You know what, you should open a restaurant.

46:07.232 --> 46:11.580
- You're good cook.
- Besides, he already has a job with a good pay.

46:11.581 --> 46:15.856
- We don't miss anything.
- Don't get excited.

46:15.857 --> 46:19.749
Sofia, come to me, honey.

46:23.748 --> 46:26.495
- Good night.
Good night.  - Bye, bye.

46:29.115 --> 46:37.520
I have a job for you.
You wanna make some money?

46:37.521 --> 46:39.840
No, i don't.

46:39.841 --> 46:42.666
- No?
- No, i don't want to.

46:42.667 --> 46:47.219
Because of Sabrine and Bruno.
I live and support myself honestly.

46:47.220 --> 46:51.591
Alright we'll discuss it any other time.

46:53.106 --> 46:55.359
Let me know.

47:01.501 --> 47:03.951
- Jacques, you got a minute?
- Yeah, i do.

47:03.952 --> 47:09.436
- I have serious problems.
- Like what?

47:09.437 --> 47:12.228
I'll have to fire somebody.

47:12.229 --> 47:15.859
- But above all...
- I get it.

47:16.960 --> 47:19.136
- Wait...
- It's alright.

47:19.137 --> 47:23.825
- Last one to come, first one to go.
- I haven't decided yet.

47:23.826 --> 47:29.153
- Don't make anything out of it, you're good man.
- Don't worry because of me.

47:37.042 --> 47:41.060
- So, i'm ready.
Let's go.   - Jacques?

47:43.061 --> 47:45.445
- Jacques, where are you going?
- Everything's ok. I'm going out with my buddies.

47:45.446 --> 47:49.348
What buddies?
You said you're done with it.

47:49.349 --> 47:53.610
- Listen to me!
- You listen to me! I don't have time for this now.

47:53.611 --> 47:56.417
- You promised me that you won't hang out with them anymore.
- That's history.

47:56.418 --> 47:59.352
Go back to them and
that whore too!

47:59.353 --> 48:02.282
- And what's bothering you?
- Why can't you just stay home?

48:02.283 --> 48:05.159
This is the home of my parents!
I lost my job!

48:05.160 --> 48:09.402
- I don't care whose home is it!
- Quiet! You wake up Bruno!

48:09.403 --> 48:12.635
If you leave, I'll call cops!

48:17.456 --> 48:20.474
What did you say?

48:20.475 --> 48:23.348
Say it again! Repeat what you just said!

48:24.645 --> 48:28.540
Don't you ever say these words again, ok?

48:34.980 --> 48:40.760
- Come here! Open the mouth!
- So, kill me!  - Open your mouth!

48:46.762 --> 48:53.101
If i should choose between my
buddies and you, i'd choose them.

48:53.102 --> 48:55.842
Remember that.

48:55.843 --> 48:58.551
Mom!

49:03.912 --> 49:07.097
Take care of daughter.

49:15.582 --> 49:20.662
Fat Guido.
You think i can't recognize you through the mask?

49:24.852 --> 49:27.775
You're ridiculous.

49:27.776 --> 49:31.035
- Yeah, sure.
- The guy you're getting these papers for...

49:31.336 --> 49:32.836
is already dead.

49:33.036 --> 49:36.434
- You asshole.
Looser. - Shut up!

49:36.435 --> 49:38.604
Who sent you?

49:38.605 --> 49:41.115
- Chevallier?
- Shut up!

49:41.116 --> 49:43.317
This is your end.
You're finished.

49:43.318 --> 49:45.878
You've reached your goal.

49:47.277 --> 49:49.617
I found them.

49:54.895 --> 49:59.173
- Why did you do it?
Mind your own shit. Any other questions?

49:59.174 --> 50:03.394
- You killed unarmed man!
- Do you recall how you put the gun in your wife's mouth.

50:03.395 --> 50:05.383
That's something different.

50:07.026 --> 50:09.154
I break.

50:11.416 --> 50:15.916
- Do you bet more or you wanna take a break?
- Time, time, time...

50:17.938 --> 50:21.728
You don't need me to give you an advice.
You'll figure it out yourself.

50:32.530 --> 50:35.861
- Here!
- Why are you throwing away your wedding ring?

50:35.862 --> 50:39.549
- She has abandoned us. Me and three kids.
- What?

50:39.550 --> 50:41.736
Yeah.

50:43.809 --> 50:46.928
- Really?
Yeah.   - Good.

50:46.929 --> 50:51.258
You think this is more than three?

50:51.259 --> 50:53.947
Doesn't matter. Fuck Sofia.

50:55.565 --> 51:03.388
So, Who is the best?
Your friend Paul won everything.

51:43.527 --> 51:48.602
- Handsome, are you gonna buy me a drink?
He can't, he's here with me.

51:50.062 --> 51:52.003
okay then.

52:05.965 --> 52:07.909
Thanks.

52:09.057 --> 52:12.711
- What's your name?
- Jeanne.

52:12.712 --> 52:17.150
Jeanne? Funny.
And I am Tarzan.

52:21.577 --> 52:26.896
- My real name is Jacques.
- My pleasure Jacques.

52:26.897 --> 52:31.838
- What do you want to drink?
- I thought it's customary for a gentleman to ask this question.

52:31.839 --> 52:34.686
Traditions need to be changed.

52:34.687 --> 52:39.186
- I try. I'm ready for everything.
- Me too.

52:40.790 --> 52:42.918
Really?

52:42.919 --> 52:45.306
Yes.

52:49.225 --> 52:52.266
- Quiet! Nobody moves!
- Everybody put your hands on the table!

52:52.267 --> 52:56.821
- Quickly, all of you hands on the table!
- I said, hands on the table!

52:56.822 --> 53:00.124
Hey, calm her down!

53:00.125 --> 53:03.995
Move, hurry, hurry!

53:05.713 --> 53:07.787
What's your problem?!

53:11.203 --> 53:13.357
- I said, quiet!
- Quiet!

53:14.566 --> 53:16.534
- Quick, move!
- Jacques...

53:17.806 --> 53:20.212
- now you're stealing from me?
Do you have a problem with it?

53:20.213 --> 53:26.115
- You won't get too far.
- Don't worry about me.

53:27.333 --> 53:29.455
I have what i want.

53:30.852 --> 53:33.688
Here is a tip.

53:41.910 --> 53:45.169
- Dad, why isn't it working?
Sweetie,

53:45.170 --> 53:49.132
because the ball and the racket must be this way.

54:05.068 --> 54:09.263
- Are you alright?
Dad, does it hurt? - No, it's nothing, honey.

54:09.264 --> 54:11.941
I'm only injured.

54:12.264 --> 54:14.741
- I love you dad.
- I love you too.

54:23.870 --> 54:27.002
In front of my daughter!
What the hell is it!

54:27.525 --> 54:31.145
Will you stay together? Do you still want
to be with him?

54:31.146 --> 54:34.314
- To the end.
Yes, of course.

54:35.240 --> 54:40.705
If you love this woman, run away with her
and come back when everything settles down.

54:40.706 --> 54:43.379
Do you really mean it?

54:43.380 --> 54:46.835
You think they won't go after us once we cross the border?

54:46.836 --> 54:51.730
The police is trying to get you,
i won't help you with that.

54:51.731 --> 54:55.053
Yeah, but they were shooting at my daughter!
I guess there are some rules!

54:55.054 --> 55:00.839
What rules?! In this bussiness
there's only one rule, rule of the jungle.

55:00.840 --> 55:03.743
Everything has principles and moral laws.

55:03.744 --> 55:07.546
Get ready.
It will hurt.

55:18.882 --> 55:21.318
Don't twist, I almost had her.

55:23.401 --> 55:25.121
Guido!

55:28.281 --> 55:32.043
Remember in the future,
this is being used for killing people!

55:33.906 --> 55:35.814
Good.

55:51.276 --> 55:53.521
Let me, i'll help you out.

55:53.522 --> 55:56.455
Bye mom.

55:56.456 --> 56:01.021
- Come to me.
- Bye dad.

56:02.422 --> 56:05.893
- My love.

More, more, more!

57:04.577 --> 57:06.663
Good!

57:43.050 --> 57:45.546
You're doing pretty good for a Frenchman.

57:45.547 --> 57:48.784
It seems you are not from around here.

57:48.785 --> 57:51.623
How long have you been here?

A month or two.

Do you like this job?

57:58.984 --> 58:02.365
I was doing better back in France.

I was robbing banks.

Because of your criminal past I have to deny
your residence application.

58:44.268 --> 58:48.480
You have 10 days to leave Canadian territory.

59:04.161 --> 59:05.811
Dear.

59:05.812 --> 59:08.148
How did it go at the immigration?

59:10.011 --> 59:14.369
Good, but we need more time.

59:14.370 --> 59:19.217
Next week you don't have to go back to construction job.

59:19.218 --> 59:22.742
- Why?
- I replied  to an ad from some millionaire.

59:22.743 --> 59:25.743
He's looking for a driver.
We'll go for an interview.

59:27.392 --> 59:31.101

Yes, I always want to be with you.

59:53.923 --> 59:57.336

- Welcome.
- So it's you, Jacques and Jeanne.

01:00:08.289 --> 01:00:11.044
My guardian angels.

01:00:12.459 --> 01:00:18.301
- I suppose that we are hired.
- And you have my blessing too, my son.

01:00:18.302 --> 01:00:23.243
So in that case, thanks dad.

01:00:39.282 --> 01:00:42.259
Let's go
one, two and three.

01:00:43.723 --> 01:00:45.197
Are you alright?

01:00:45.198 --> 01:00:47.509
Slowly.

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:49.834
We are not in a hurry.

01:00:51.108 --> 01:00:53.771
Don't worry, i'm holding you.

01:00:55.826 --> 01:00:57.563
So where to, sir?

01:00:57.564 --> 01:01:00.438
- to Santlar street.
- Sure.

01:01:18.162 --> 01:01:20.074
Hello sir.

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:25.917
- Have you paid for the parking?
- I live here, here is my card.
- Good then, take care.

01:01:44.964 --> 01:01:46.215
Look.

01:01:46.216 --> 01:01:49.554
- This is from Jacques.
- From Jacques?

01:02:26.201 --> 01:02:29.517
I'm telling you for the first and  the last time,
stop mingling in to my work.

01:02:29.518 --> 01:02:32.848
- I don't want to see you here anymore!
- What? Are you going to complain?

01:02:32.928 --> 01:02:34.848
I've been working here for more than 20 years!

01:02:34.849 --> 01:02:37.511
Just go!

01:02:37.512 --> 01:02:41.695
- You'll see, you won't get out of this that easily!
- Go, just go!

01:02:42.324 --> 01:02:44.545
That's okay.

01:02:55.386 --> 01:02:58.314
My gardener gave me a notice.

01:02:58.315 --> 01:03:04.442
You talked to him with disrespect.
The whole altercation was provoked by you.

01:03:04.443 --> 01:03:07.298
- That guy is just a nobody.
- Maybe he is,

01:03:07.299 --> 01:03:11.641
but he served me loyally for 20 years.

01:03:11.642 --> 01:03:14.585
And I only knew you for three months,

01:03:14.586 --> 01:03:19.124
so with less regret i rather say goodbye to you.

01:03:19.125 --> 01:03:23.483
- I'm giving two days to leave this house.
- Sure. Come, we're leaving.

01:04:05.072 --> 01:04:08.139
<i>Jacques, we have to talk!</i>

01:04:13.198 --> 01:04:15.371
<i>Jacques!</i>

01:04:17.205 --> 01:04:19.873
<i>- Jacquesi!
- Damn!</i>

01:04:22.195 --> 01:04:23.879
What?! What!

01:04:26.131 --> 01:04:31.309
- Why are you treating me like this?
For disrespecting me, Georges.

01:04:31.310 --> 01:04:35.068
- and for disrespecting my wife.
- Tell me...

01:04:36.354 --> 01:04:38.295
what do you intend to do with me?

01:04:38.296 --> 01:04:43.169
- Jacques?!
- What? At first, you've been so nice to us,

01:04:43.170 --> 01:04:47.230
and then because of that idiot gardener,
you fired us!

01:04:47.231 --> 01:04:49.626
Are we some kind of scum?

01:04:50.786 --> 01:04:55.150
You'll pay for this.
I'll teach you some respect!

01:04:55.151 --> 01:04:58.416
- My brother will pay you.
- It's possible.

01:04:59.310 --> 01:05:03.363
In the meanwhile let me watch the TV!

01:05:47.574 --> 01:05:51.251
Jacques!

01:06:27.355 --> 01:06:29.122
Help!

01:06:33.454 --> 01:06:37.065
- Hi  Jacques. This is Jean-Paul.
- What's up?
- I don't think he'll come.

01:06:37.066 --> 01:06:40.390
We'll see about that.
I'm done talking!

01:06:46.125 --> 01:06:48.889
He thinks, he is gonna pull my leg.

01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:52.909
That old fart didn't show up with the money!
He'll pay, you'll see Jeanne.

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:26.171
That's him.

01:07:32.736 --> 01:07:34.715
Shit!

01:08:33.926 --> 01:08:36.643
- What are we going to do, Jacques?  Look.
- Shit!

01:08:39.689 --> 01:08:42.228
I have to stop.

01:08:43.001 --> 01:08:45.020
Fine, stop.

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:48.100
Get ready!

01:09:07.015 --> 01:09:09.675
No. It's too many of them.

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:57.103
THE END OF THE RUN FOR BONNIE SCHNEIDER

One word!

It doesn't matter what. Anything.

Your stay in isolation is over.
Welcome at the prison with maximum security.

Forget about it, Frenchman.

01:17:22.453 --> 01:17:25.711
I've seen you on TV.

01:17:27.097 --> 01:17:29.898
Long live Quebec, right?

01:17:32.290 --> 01:17:35.252
You think you can get through barb wire?

01:17:38.498 --> 01:17:43.544
Your friend Mercier is right there
where you've been tortured by Gottier.

01:17:47.562 --> 01:17:51.508
- How is he?
- How could he be, he's barely alive.

01:17:55.510 --> 01:17:59.541
See you soon, French.

01:17:59.576 --> 01:18:02.671
By the way, you looked more happier on TV.

01:19:12.219 --> 01:19:14.578
Hey!

01:19:17.438 --> 01:19:20.119
- Nice to see you again.
- You too.

Hey, hold on.
They're watching.

- Here you go.
- Thanks.

01:19:49.597 --> 01:19:52.057
Do you know these two?

01:19:52.058 --> 01:19:55.556
- Which ones?
- The fat one with buddy.

01:19:57.136 --> 01:20:00.643
That fat one is murderer.

01:20:00.644 --> 01:20:05.442
The other one, too.
He's suspected of killing the guard.

01:20:08.604 --> 01:20:10.268
Why? Are they causing problems for you?

01:20:11.804 --> 01:20:13.800
Right now, i don't know.

01:20:15.252 --> 01:20:19.351
I think I know how we'll escape from here.

01:20:19.352 --> 01:20:22.299
We'll get through the fence.

01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:25.442
During our walk in daylight?

01:20:27.651 --> 01:20:29.819
Do you have any other ideas?

01:20:29.820 --> 01:20:34.378
Good, Jacques.
When?

01:20:36.971 --> 01:20:40.246
By the fall you'll be either outside or
you'll be dead.

01:20:41.746 --> 01:20:45.357
I'm for it. Death or freedom.

01:21:19.818 --> 01:21:22.981
Tell me honestly.
What do you want from me, Frenchman?

01:21:22.982 --> 01:21:29.220
- I need tools.
- What's in it for me?

01:21:30.652 --> 01:21:33.179
I don't have anything to offer you.

01:21:33.180 --> 01:21:35.811
Except a chance for freedom.

01:21:35.812 --> 01:21:39.938
If i'll manage to get out of here,
i'll take you with me. I'm giving you my word.

01:21:41.130 --> 01:21:44.051
You're desparate, Frenchman.
I like it.

- Let's go.
- See you.

01:21:49.906 --> 01:21:52.403
Did he agree?

01:21:53.670 --> 01:21:56.462
- What day is today?
- I know is monday.

01:22:06.497 --> 01:22:09.826
Jesus, Frenchman!
Do you want to get killed?!

01:22:14.179 --> 01:22:17.973
But not here and not on monday.

01:22:25.945 --> 01:22:29.857
They are always watching,
except on monday after weekend hangover.

01:24:28.844 --> 01:24:30.697
Mercier, let's go.

01:25:13.457 --> 01:25:15.782
- Are you looking out?
- Yeah.

01:25:40.181 --> 01:25:41.755
Hurry!

01:26:19.821 --> 01:26:21.498
Don't worry, everything is ok.

01:26:27.002 --> 01:26:29.468
Stop! Or i'll shoot!

01:27:08.838 --> 01:27:10.310
Come on, let's get out of here!

01:27:36.623 --> 01:27:39.157

Face to the ground!

- Jean-Paul!
- What?

01:28:10.824 --> 01:28:13.751
- They talk about us.
- Leave me alone right now!

- Jean-Paul!
Give me two minutes, damn!

01:28:42.026 --> 01:28:43.924
We're famous, Jean-Paul.

01:28:53.824 --> 01:28:57.418
Don't go out with your hands up
only if they'll capture both of us.

01:28:57.419 --> 01:28:59.687
They shoot at everybody, whoever moves.

01:29:01.677 --> 01:29:04.881
- We must be fast.
How much time do we have?

01:29:04.882 --> 01:29:06.982
30 seconds.

01:29:08.945 --> 01:29:10.767
Not enough?

01:29:13.746 --> 01:29:15.486
- Do we have a choice?
- No.

01:29:27.278 --> 01:29:29.501
I wanna see your hands!

01:29:29.502 --> 01:29:32.331
Quick on the floor!

I said don't move!

01:29:43.646 --> 01:29:46.255
Don't move and nothing happens to you!

01:29:47.928 --> 01:29:51.306
I'm telling you, don't move!

01:29:52.701 --> 01:29:54.652

01:29:54.653 --> 01:30:00.329
Stay where you are!

Thank you ladies and gentlemen.
Take care. Stay nicely on the floor.

01:30:21.451 --> 01:30:24.337
No, not yet. That one across the street too.

- What?
Let's go!

01:30:26.407 --> 01:30:28.207
You're crazy!

01:30:55.336 --> 01:30:57.498

01:30:58.681 --> 01:31:00.110
It's time.

01:33:11.325 --> 01:33:12.284
Now?

Not bad. It's ok.

No, nothing is fine.
As soon as i'll get better,

01:37:42.549 --> 01:37:45.016
i'll be there right away.

01:37:46.213 --> 01:37:50.120
- No, don't organize anything.
What's going on with you, honey? Stop.

01:37:50.121 --> 01:37:54.349
Mercier is with me.
We're armed to the teeth.

01:37:54.350 --> 01:37:56.716
I'll come to get you.

01:37:56.717 --> 01:38:01.255
No, please don't do it.
Soon my jail time will be over.

01:38:01.256 --> 01:38:03.918
Hush, what are you talking about?

01:38:05.128 --> 01:38:09.432
I'll come to get you, my love.
We'll leave together and everything will stay behind us.

01:38:10.907 --> 01:38:14.788
Don't do it, Jacques.
I don't want you to come.

01:38:14.789 --> 01:38:18.200
- I'm asking you, please understand.
- I'll come to get you!

01:38:18.201 --> 01:38:22.012
- I'll come! Stop!
- No, they know you'll come.

01:38:22.013 --> 01:38:25.360
They're waiting for you! They could kill you!

01:38:26.641 --> 01:38:28.381
They won't kill me, trust me.

01:38:28.382 --> 01:38:30.897
Soon, bye.

01:38:30.898 --> 01:38:33.861
Jacques, you must not come.

01:38:33.862 --> 01:38:38.733
I said i'll come and i really will do it, damn!

01:38:45.564 --> 01:38:48.702
- Did you hear me? I'll come.
No, Jacques...

01:38:52.099 --> 01:38:54.606
No...

01:38:56.260 --> 01:38:58.519
Calm down and be ready, you hear me?

It's over, Jacques.

01:40:06.009 --> 01:40:07.992
Now try with the left hand.

01:40:20.418 --> 01:40:23.786
- Damn!
- It's harder now, isn't it?

01:40:23.787 --> 01:40:26.896
My hand is still weak.

01:40:35.730 --> 01:40:38.102
Watch out.
