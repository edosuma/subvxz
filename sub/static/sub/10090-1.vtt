That feels so good.
I feel so relaxed.

01:32.880 --> 01:35.155
You know the help is off, Crewe.

01:35.360 --> 01:37.191
The phones are off.

01:38.280 --> 01:39.872
We're all alone.

Let's get it on, honey. Come on.

01:46.680 --> 01:49.752
- Honey.
- What?

01:49.960 --> 01:54.112
Wake up, baby. Come on.
You know it'll be good.

01:54.320 --> 01:57.869
You know how good it is.
Come on, Crewe.

01:58.080 --> 01:59.911
Get off me!

02:02.160 --> 02:04.799
Son of a bitch.

02:13.240 --> 02:14.832
Where are you going?

02:15.760 --> 02:18.957
- Splitting.
- Splitting?

02:19.160 --> 02:23.950
You split when I tell you to split,
you All-American son of a bitch.

02:24.160 --> 02:25.991
Lovely, lovely.

02:29.440 --> 02:32.113
And when you walk out, stay out.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.595
You're too expensive to be useless.

02:39.720 --> 02:40.994
Whore!

02:42.040 --> 02:48.434
- That's exactly what you are, a whore.
- I never looked at it that way before.

02:48.640 --> 02:50.517
Everybody's bought you.

02:50.720 --> 02:54.030
Colleges, the pros, your gamblers.

02:54.240 --> 02:56.470
Who bought those
beautiful caps on your teeth,

02:56.680 --> 02:59.399
the clothes you're wearing
and the bloody tan you've got?

02:59.600 --> 03:01.033
Me!

03:02.280 --> 03:05.431
Have I ever neglected to thank you,
Melissa?

03:05.640 --> 03:07.278
You has-been.

03:07.760 --> 03:09.034
Where're your keys?

03:09.240 --> 03:13.119
If I took everything back... Forget
my keys! You'd be bare-assed naked.

03:13.320 --> 03:17.233
- Where're your goddamn keys?
- Don't touch my keys.

03:20.160 --> 03:22.993
I think the love
has gone out of our relationship.

03:23.200 --> 03:24.633
Bastard.

03:26.600 --> 03:29.034
Don't you take my Masseratti.

03:29.240 --> 03:31.470
I earned it.

03:35.640 --> 03:39.428
I told you not to touch
my goddamn car!

04:13.960 --> 04:15.234
Police.

07:00.920 --> 07:06.358
- Do you have a driver's licence?
- What, are you taking a poll?

07:08.480 --> 07:11.950
Well, look what we got here.
A miniature cop.

07:14.840 --> 07:16.512
Can we see your driver's licence?

07:17.360 --> 07:18.634
What?

07:18.840 --> 07:21.149
Can we see your driver's licence?

07:21.360 --> 07:24.432
See if I can get it out.

07:29.520 --> 07:30.919
It's him all right.

07:31.120 --> 07:33.076
Why'd you dump her car in the Bay?

07:33.280 --> 07:36.078
- What?
- Why'd you dump her car in the Bay?

07:36.280 --> 07:38.840
I couldn't find a car wash.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.398
Step away from the bar.

07:51.240 --> 07:53.834
Mister, step away from the bar!

07:54.040 --> 07:56.793
Don't get pushy, cowboy.

08:00.960 --> 08:03.554
- Turn it around.
- Come on!

08:10.400 --> 08:13.233
- Hold that son of a bitch!
- Damn!

08:13.440 --> 08:17.319
Now we got you
for stealing a car, drunken driving,

08:17.520 --> 08:20.159
drunk in public and resisting arrest.

08:22.400 --> 08:26.871
- Want something else?
- Yeah. I'm going to make you taller.

09:12.160 --> 09:14.037
OK, men, let's go.

09:38.040 --> 09:39.996
Good afternoon.
Where are you from?

09:40.200 --> 09:43.749
- Palm Beach County.
- Thank you, sir. Second door down.

09:44.360 --> 09:45.634
This way, men.

09:45.840 --> 09:49.628
They gave you $10,000
for shaving off your moustache on TV?

09:52.600 --> 09:55.068
How about giving me $5,000 worth?

09:56.840 --> 10:02.198
Coming right off: There's about
twenty-five hundred, three thousand,

10:02.400 --> 10:04.038
four thousand coming up,

10:04.240 --> 10:06.515
five thousand!

10:17.400 --> 10:19.960
- Anything else, sir?
- That's it.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.719
Warden Hazen thinks
you're pretty hot stuff.

11:06.880 --> 11:09.348
But I'm Captain Knauer.

11:09.560 --> 11:13.792
I'm going to spell
things out for you. I run this prison.

11:14.440 --> 11:17.193
He sits there growing old.
I'm out here busting heads.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.991
And I run the football team.

11:20.440 --> 11:23.113
- What football team?
- My football team.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.274
Oh.

11:26.080 --> 11:28.913
Now, Hazen's going to ask you
to help coach.

11:29.120 --> 11:31.634
And you just tell him, "No way".

11:39.560 --> 11:40.879
Know something?

11:44.840 --> 11:46.831
I don't like you.

11:48.280 --> 11:50.555
You understand that?

11:50.760 --> 11:52.591
Oh, yeah.

11:55.040 --> 11:59.716
<i>Attention Cell Block 3 A. Please report

11:59.920 --> 12:02.229

<i>All men assigned to farm detail will

12:13.760 --> 12:16.911
<i>- Send him in.
- Thank you, sir.</i>

12:18.320 --> 12:22.279
- You can go in now.
- Thank you, Miss Toot.

12:36.600 --> 12:38.397
Paul Crewe.

12:39.680 --> 12:41.511
The Wrecking Crewe.

12:44.720 --> 12:47.792
- It's good to have you here.
- Thank you.

12:51.160 --> 12:55.073
Young people can learn a great deal
from a skilful football game.

12:55.280 --> 12:59.751
Offence, defence,
spirit of achievement, teamwork.

13:04.680 --> 13:06.796
You might say...

13:12.080 --> 13:16.039
...the game embodies
what has made our country great.

13:17.040 --> 13:20.191
It's a great game.
It's played by great men.

13:23.320 --> 13:29.555
We have something of a football team
here ourselves, you know.

13:31.200 --> 13:34.636
First rank, semi-pro,
South-eastern League.

13:34.840 --> 13:38.150
Runner-up, National Champions,
past five years.

13:39.520 --> 13:43.308
Mister Crewe,
what do you think of semi-pro ball?

13:43.520 --> 13:45.556
Semi-pro's a joke.

13:49.640 --> 13:55.715
Well, perhaps we could use
a few pointers from the big leagues.

13:55.920 --> 14:00.596
Captain, what do you say
to Mister Crewe here looking in,

14:00.800 --> 14:03.678
giving us the benefit
of his invaluable knowledge?

14:04.200 --> 14:09.399
That's a real good idea, Warden.
We could use all the help we can get.

14:10.280 --> 14:11.952
Well?

14:12.160 --> 14:16.199
I haven't held a football in eight
years. I'm not in very good shape.

14:16.400 --> 14:19.153
Nobody's asked you to play,
Mister Crewe.

14:19.360 --> 14:23.956
What we need is a coach. New blood.

14:24.160 --> 14:25.878
New game plan.

14:30.720 --> 14:35.475
Anybody who was pro football's
Most Valuable Player is special,

14:35.680 --> 14:38.319
and I want to have that.

14:40.120 --> 14:42.031
I'm not interested in football anymore.

14:45.920 --> 14:49.993
Mister Crewe, I don't mind saying,

14:50.760 --> 14:53.228
I pulled a lot of strings
to get you down here.

14:54.240 --> 14:55.673
I appreciate that.

14:56.240 --> 14:58.151
Look.

14:58.360 --> 15:01.477
What I want is a national title.

15:02.800 --> 15:06.679
If, perchance, you should help us
achieve that goal,

15:06.880 --> 15:11.556
I expect your stay here
with us will be very agreeable.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.274
Well?

15:18.200 --> 15:22.159
I just want to do my time,
then get out of here.

15:23.160 --> 15:24.593
Very well.

15:30.760 --> 15:35.550
All right, I'll turn you over
to the good hands of Captain Knauer.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.352
Swamp reclamation.

15:39.120 --> 15:41.839
Get him out of here.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.830
- Captain.
- Yes, sir.

15:48.040 --> 15:49.837
I'd like a word with you.

15:52.480 --> 15:57.315
For the past five years,
you've promised me the national title,

15:57.520 --> 15:59.795
<i>and every year,
you've come up short.</i>

16:00.000 --> 16:03.470
<i>- I try, sir.
- When I want an answer, I'll indicate.</i>

16:03.680 --> 16:05.477
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

16:05.680 --> 16:07.352
<i>You've asked for bonus money.</i>

16:07.560 --> 16:10.313
Certainly take their football
seriously, don't they?

16:10.760 --> 16:14.753
<i>This year you've asked for new
game uniforms. I've OK'ed them.</i>

16:15.400 --> 16:17.391
Everything you've asked for,
I've given you.

16:17.600 --> 16:20.319
Yes, sir. And I appreciate it, sir.

16:21.760 --> 16:24.149
I want that title.

16:24.360 --> 16:27.591
You'll give me that title,
or you'll be out of a job.

16:27.800 --> 16:31.156
You and all that
over-priced beef you call a team.

16:31.360 --> 16:34.033
We should be
in the Superbowl by now!

16:34.880 --> 16:38.873
<i>I've lost patience! The gravy train is
over! This year you're going to win!</i>

16:39.080 --> 16:40.399
You've lovely hair.

16:40.600 --> 16:45.435
<i>...your last chance! Prison is no
different from any other community.</i>

16:46.200 --> 16:49.112
Ever find any spiders in it?

16:49.320 --> 16:51.231
<i>...then I haven't done my job.</i>

16:51.720 --> 16:53.790
I'm not being unreasonable, am I?

16:54.680 --> 16:57.240
- No, sir.
- Then you'll give me the title?

16:57.440 --> 16:59.795
- Yes, sir.
- Good!

17:01.280 --> 17:03.669
I want that man out there.

17:03.880 --> 17:08.749
And I want you to make
that son of a bitch enthusiastic!

17:10.839 --> 17:14.469
- Ever do it standing up?
- Let's move it.

17:22.480 --> 17:26.108
- I say forget football, you do it.
- Why are you so mad?

17:26.319 --> 17:31.952
- You better start taking life seriously.
- I did exactly what you told me to do.

17:51.280 --> 17:53.794
Hey, Superstar.
Get a good night's sleep?

17:54.000 --> 17:56.150
Too bad you missed breakfast.
It was yummy!

17:57.240 --> 17:58.673
Gotta get it done.

17:58.880 --> 18:03.795
- This is make-work day.
- What's make-work day?

18:04.000 --> 18:06.230
You shovel it in
and shovel back out again.

18:06.440 --> 18:09.557
Hustle in there now.
Cover that bank.

18:09.760 --> 18:12.115
Get that wheelbarrow, Woody.

18:12.920 --> 18:14.638
Let's go. Single file.

18:14.840 --> 18:18.628
Hang it up, hang it up.
Let's get covered.

18:20.240 --> 18:23.437
All right, let's go. Come on.

18:23.640 --> 18:25.471
Get a shovel.

18:28.160 --> 18:29.559
Hey, Superstar.

18:32.120 --> 18:34.998
I got an idea. Granny.

18:41.120 --> 18:44.112
You ever work with a nigger before?

18:47.520 --> 18:49.272
Get another shovel there, boy.

18:55.880 --> 18:58.394
All right. Let's go.

19:04.080 --> 19:05.911
Heave it up!

19:07.280 --> 19:10.955
- Sitting down, boss?
- Not today, boy.

19:16.600 --> 19:20.673
- Wiping off, boss?
- Not today, boy.

19:22.360 --> 19:25.079
- Rolling one, boss?
- Not yet, boy.

19:26.280 --> 19:29.192
Now you know
how black man's work feels.

19:29.400 --> 19:30.879
How do you like it?

19:31.080 --> 19:33.230
Oh, it sort of grows on you.

19:33.440 --> 19:34.998
No talking there, Granny.

19:35.720 --> 19:40.157
- Yes, boss.
- You'll find yourselves in bad time.

19:40.360 --> 19:44.194
Yes, boss. Sorry about that, boss.

19:44.640 --> 19:47.279
What's he think this is, good time?

19:47.480 --> 19:51.837
Looky, looky, looky,
here comes cooky!

19:58.880 --> 20:03.510
Big deal. Look at him now.

20:06.200 --> 20:09.317
How do you like them apples,
Superstar?

20:12.960 --> 20:14.439
Move the line.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.956
Real friendly types
you got around here.

21:01.160 --> 21:04.869
- Might be your own fault.
- Oh, really?

21:05.080 --> 21:08.914
Most of these old boys have nothing.
Never had nothing to start with.

21:09.120 --> 21:12.749
But you, you had it all.

21:12.960 --> 21:16.396
Then you let your team-mates down,
got caught taking bribes.

21:17.200 --> 21:20.158
- I did, did I?
- I ain't saying either way.

21:20.360 --> 21:22.920
I'm just saying
you could've robbed banks, sold dope,

21:23.120 --> 21:26.635
stole your grandmother's pension,
and none of us would've minded.

21:26.840 --> 21:31.356
But shaving points off a football game,
that's un-American.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.551
You take football
real serious down here.

21:37.520 --> 21:40.796
- Mind if I ask you one question?
- Yeah, I do.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.991
Why'd you do it?

21:43.200 --> 21:47.876
- It's a long story.
- Well, I got eight years.

21:58.840 --> 22:02.150
Oh, my God.
What the hell is that?

22:02.360 --> 22:06.114
That's a member
of the warden's football team.

22:06.320 --> 22:10.074
Some of these guards are not
just everyday run-of-the-mill guards.

22:13.240 --> 22:16.437
Crewe! Granville! Front and centre.

22:16.640 --> 22:18.710
What now?

22:18.920 --> 22:23.232
That means we don't get
to finish this delicious lunch.

22:34.200 --> 22:35.553
What's he looking for?

22:36.840 --> 22:38.319
Snakes.

22:38.520 --> 22:40.795
- Snakes?
- Yeah.

22:49.720 --> 22:51.915
Take five!

23:00.720 --> 23:04.599
- Rolling one, boss?
- Not today, boy.

23:10.760 --> 23:12.159
Jeez!

23:25.640 --> 23:28.757
- Terrific.
- Football faggot!

23:31.720 --> 23:35.076
- Salt pill up here, boss?
- Go get it, boy.

23:35.880 --> 23:37.996
How long you been in this asylum,
Pop?

23:38.200 --> 23:39.792
Thirty-four years.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.116
- Thirty-four years?
- Yep.

23:42.320 --> 23:45.437
Last six and a half
right here in the swamp.

23:45.640 --> 23:49.030
Too old for reclamation,
so they made me barracks chief.

23:49.920 --> 23:52.673
Aren't you coming up
for parole soon?

23:52.880 --> 23:59.035
Thirty years ago, I made the mistake
of slugging a fish bull. Hazen.

24:00.120 --> 24:02.918
Just my luck he made warden.

24:03.120 --> 24:09.195
Sent me out here when I was 64 to die,
but I've been hanging on.

24:09.400 --> 24:14.110
We'll all be in the same place a thousand
years from now, so what the hell.

24:14.320 --> 24:17.551
Yeah. What the hell.

24:19.960 --> 24:23.794
All right, you assholes.
Back to work.

24:26.960 --> 24:28.757
Hey!

24:30.240 --> 24:33.994
This ain't no country club, Superstar.
Move your ass.

24:40.720 --> 24:44.508
No, no, son.
You've got to get off the bunk.

24:44.720 --> 24:47.632
Man, for God's sake, get up.

24:49.200 --> 24:50.838
On your feet.

24:51.040 --> 24:57.070
Listen to me. Nobody's allowed on the
bunks till five minutes before lights out.

24:58.920 --> 25:01.753
They'll put you in the oven.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.389
Man, that can kill you.

25:07.360 --> 25:10.079
Did you have any supper yet?

25:10.280 --> 25:11.713
No.

25:11.920 --> 25:14.150
Later I'll try to get you some chow.

25:14.360 --> 25:17.750
You got to eat, man,
or you'll die of mono.

25:18.360 --> 25:20.874
And they could care less.

25:29.560 --> 25:31.835
- Get off me!
- Hey, watch it, man!

25:32.040 --> 25:33.837
Where the hell you going?

25:35.240 --> 25:38.630
Twinkle, twinkle, little Superstar.

25:43.960 --> 25:45.552
- Guard.
- Yeah?

25:45.760 --> 25:49.355
I want to see the warden.

26:01.640 --> 26:03.073
Pass the salt.

26:49.640 --> 26:51.517
Boy.

28:18.160 --> 28:19.434
Come on.

28:42.960 --> 28:44.791
Go, baby!

29:25.880 --> 29:30.078
That's going to get you
twenty-four hours in the hot box, boy.

29:31.920 --> 29:34.070
I quit.

29:43.040 --> 29:44.871
What makes you so tough?

29:45.600 --> 29:48.398
I don't know. It just comes natural.

29:49.760 --> 29:51.990
That'll cost you, boy.

30:11.120 --> 30:12.838
Rise and shine.

30:13.320 --> 30:15.038
Rise and shine.

30:21.400 --> 30:24.597
Oh. It's room service.

30:24.800 --> 30:26.677
Pretty gamey.

30:29.400 --> 30:33.439
Shower and put on some clean whites.
The warden wants to see you.

30:33.640 --> 30:37.110
- The warden?
- Get on down there.

30:51.160 --> 30:52.718
Well?

30:53.360 --> 30:56.557
- What do you think of my team?
- Mean.

30:57.120 --> 30:58.997
Crude, but mean.

30:59.520 --> 31:03.433
I was depending on you, you know.

31:03.640 --> 31:08.794
Well, there's so little time left now,
it's quite a problem.

31:09.760 --> 31:13.196
They need something
before that first game.

31:15.520 --> 31:18.557
- You have to win the first game?
- Right.

31:18.760 --> 31:20.637
Well, it's relatively simple.

31:20.840 --> 31:24.594
Yeah. Get yourself a tune-up game,
you know?

31:24.800 --> 31:26.791
A what?

31:27.000 --> 31:32.279
A tune-up game, like the pros have,
with a hungry team not in your league.

31:32.480 --> 31:35.313
You bring them here
and kick the shit out of them.

31:36.240 --> 31:37.514
Well.

31:39.800 --> 31:43.588
How do you think
we'd do against the pros?

31:43.800 --> 31:46.234
- That team against the pros?
- Yeah.

31:46.440 --> 31:49.591
You'd have a real problem.

31:49.800 --> 31:54.828
Well, how do you think
we'd do against the cons?

31:56.200 --> 31:58.395
- I didn't know they had a team.
- They don't.

31:59.520 --> 32:02.512
But you've given me an inspiration.

32:02.720 --> 32:06.838
I've decided, Mister Crewe, that
you're going to put one together for me.

32:07.040 --> 32:10.191
For that little tune-up game, you know?

32:10.400 --> 32:13.392
And you're going to play quarterback.

32:14.440 --> 32:15.793
I can't.

32:16.000 --> 32:20.790
Why? They're semi-pro,
you said yourself. A big joke.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.197
That's why people like me around,
my sense of humour.

32:25.000 --> 32:30.279
Mister Crewe,
as old Mister Sam used to say,

32:30.480 --> 32:35.793
"In this institution,
to get along, you go along."

32:38.280 --> 32:40.794
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!

32:41.000 --> 32:44.959
I'm just going to do what's left
of my eighteen months quietly,

32:45.160 --> 32:46.718
and I'm out of here.

32:46.920 --> 32:50.515
Oh, yes. Eighteen months.

32:53.240 --> 32:56.152
But that is to make parole.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.753
That was before you struck
Captain Knauer.

33:03.360 --> 33:07.797
Your basic sentence
is from two to five years.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.070
You could be here a long time.

33:17.000 --> 33:21.835
If I get this team together, how long
do I have to get them organized?

33:22.040 --> 33:23.393
Four weeks.

33:25.440 --> 33:28.512
- We're talking about early parole?
- I believe we are.

33:34.920 --> 33:36.717
All right. I'll play.

33:37.920 --> 33:39.319
What? I didn't hear.

33:40.800 --> 33:43.234
- I'll play.
- Sir.

33:44.440 --> 33:46.635
I'll play, sir.

33:48.880 --> 33:53.829
History. I read you
like a book, Mister Crewe.

33:55.320 --> 33:56.673
One more thing.

33:56.880 --> 33:58.598
What is it?

33:58.800 --> 34:01.314
You keep Knauer off my back.

34:04.120 --> 34:06.588
Give us a game, Mister Crewe.

34:10.159 --> 34:12.196
I'll give you a game.

34:12.400 --> 34:13.753
"Hit and be hit".

34:13.960 --> 34:19.398
"Anyone with any experience
or desire. Prison football team sign-up".

34:19.920 --> 34:22.559
- Well, what do you think?
- No!

34:22.760 --> 34:25.558
- Maybe I'll get annihilated. Forget it.
- He's right.

34:25.760 --> 34:27.716
Now, wait a second. Hey!

34:27.920 --> 34:29.956
Here's how I look at it.

34:30.159 --> 34:32.514
Suppose you break your leg
or something.

34:32.719 --> 34:36.474
That's six weeks easy time in
the hospital. That's biscuits and gravy.

34:37.000 --> 34:40.072
Tell me something.
Would they let me play tackle?

34:40.280 --> 34:41.554
Sure.

34:41.760 --> 34:45.594
So I'd spend half the time looking
directly into Walking Boss's eyes?

34:45.800 --> 34:49.918
- Now you got it.
- I've always had a thing for him.

34:50.320 --> 34:52.754
Walking Boss
always had a thing for you.

34:52.960 --> 34:56.635
Hold it! Don't you guys know
a good thing when you see it?

34:56.840 --> 35:00.913
You get a free crack at the guards,
even a chance to kill one.

35:01.120 --> 35:03.873
- Legal!
- Bullshit! I ain't signing that damn thing.

35:04.080 --> 35:07.231
Come on, everybody.
When Rotka's right, he's right.

35:11.480 --> 35:14.119
This honky golden boy sold out
his own team-mates, didn't he?

35:14.320 --> 35:15.594
Damn sure did.

35:15.800 --> 35:17.791
- Did it once, he'll do it again.
- Right.

35:31.160 --> 35:32.434
Hi.

35:33.040 --> 35:34.314
Hi.

35:35.680 --> 35:38.638
- You know you're doing it all wrong?
- Yeah?

35:38.840 --> 35:42.150
Yeah. You'll never put
a team together with that bunch.

35:42.360 --> 35:44.590
Well, I appreciate the advice.

35:44.800 --> 35:47.314
I can help you.
I'm Nate Scarboro.

35:52.960 --> 35:56.236
- Nate Scarboro, Giants?
- Yeah.

35:56.840 --> 36:00.071
- Step into my office.
- Thank you.

36:00.760 --> 36:04.275
- I'm Paul Crewe.
- Yeah, I know.

36:05.160 --> 36:07.071
- You made All Pro, didn't you?
- Right.

36:07.280 --> 36:09.874
- Why'd you quit?
- It was simple.

36:10.000 --> 36:10.080
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:10.080 --> 36:13.390
Doc said, "Quit football or walking".
Too many knee operations.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:13.390 --> 36:13.600
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:13.600 --> 36:16.114
I figured walking was
better than sitting.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:16.114 --> 36:16.320
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:16.320 --> 36:18.390
Maybe I made the wrong choice.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:18.390 --> 36:18.600
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:18.600 --> 36:22.000
You got about 15 guys worth a damn.
The rest... How long did Hazen give you?
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to

36:22.000 --> 36:24.118
You got about 15 guys worth a damn.
The rest... How long did Hazen give you?

36:25.720 --> 36:28.359
- A month.
- Oh, you bought a bill of goods!

36:28.560 --> 36:30.312
Didn't have any choice.

36:30.880 --> 36:32.757
You don't have one black player.

36:32.960 --> 36:36.032
There are at least 15 here with
enough experience to make this club.

36:36.920 --> 36:38.353
None signed up.

36:39.480 --> 36:43.029
I played eleven years in
the league, never even got a hangnail.

36:43.240 --> 36:45.390
I'm not going to get hurt in this game.

36:45.600 --> 36:48.797
I'm getting the biggest guys I can
and surrounding myself.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.275
I've watched the guards play
for eleven years.

36:51.480 --> 36:53.596
I've seen how they won
and why they lost.

36:54.800 --> 36:58.395
I know those bums
better than they know themselves.

36:59.640 --> 37:02.757
You just got yourself a job.
Head coach.

37:05.320 --> 37:06.992
Great bunch of guys you got.

37:07.720 --> 37:10.996
"Strangled both wives with panty hose".

37:11.200 --> 37:14.749
"Triple murder
including body dismemberment".

37:14.960 --> 37:16.951
"Hacked mother with meat cleaver".

37:17.160 --> 37:18.434
Charming.

37:18.640 --> 37:21.598
Double-check the ones with two stars.
They're the most violent.

37:21.800 --> 37:23.153
Got any three-stars?

37:26.880 --> 37:29.872
Damn it, Warden,
I think this game's a big mistake.

37:30.080 --> 37:35.632
Captain, not only will you have the
chance to hone our team to a fine edge,

37:35.840 --> 37:38.957
you'll also have the opportunity
to learn a great deal about life.

37:39.160 --> 37:42.948
Why is it, do you suppose,

37:43.160 --> 37:45.515
that I can walk through this yard,

37:45.720 --> 37:48.188
surrounded by hate,

37:48.400 --> 37:50.675
and in total command?

37:50.880 --> 37:56.432
Because you've got fifteen gun turrets
all around you that say you can.

37:59.880 --> 38:01.154
Partly, partly.

38:02.080 --> 38:07.791
They could grab us right now
and slit our throats, but they don't.

38:08.000 --> 38:12.551
We get the right person, right place,
right time, we can surprise them.

38:12.760 --> 38:16.435
One game, one time. We can do it.

38:16.640 --> 38:19.279
Hey, you guys about through?
Time's almost up.

38:19.480 --> 38:20.754
OK, Pop. Hold on.

38:21.400 --> 38:24.437
You better hurry up.
What have you got for me, Sunshine?

38:25.480 --> 38:28.631
I can get you steroids, vitamins,
greenies, anything you want.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.796
I'm the best hustler in the joint.

38:31.960 --> 38:35.316
How much of what he says
can he do?

38:35.520 --> 38:37.715
He can get you laid in here.

38:37.920 --> 38:40.115
With a woman.

38:40.760 --> 38:44.309
- What more can I tell you?
- Oh, yeah?

38:44.520 --> 38:46.715
But can you get me
the guards' medical files?

38:48.240 --> 38:50.595
- What for?
- To find out who's had broken bones.

38:52.640 --> 38:55.473
Sonny Tannen, strong as an ox.
You'll love him.

38:56.680 --> 38:59.319
- That him?
- That's him.

39:03.200 --> 39:06.476
Hello, Sonny.
How'd you like to play some football?

39:06.680 --> 39:09.240
Football?

39:10.160 --> 39:11.434
Would you like that?

39:11.640 --> 39:15.474
You mean, we'd really
get to hit the guards?

39:15.680 --> 39:17.318
You like that, Sonny?

39:22.800 --> 39:25.758
Report to the practice field
tomorrow morning, nine o'clock.

39:30.880 --> 39:32.472
Cool it!

39:38.240 --> 39:39.753
- What's his name?
- Indian.

39:39.960 --> 39:44.636
- That makes sense.
- Now, don't do any ethnic jokes.

39:50.640 --> 39:53.598
- Indian, this is Paul Crewe.
- Hi.

39:53.800 --> 39:55.836
I hear you play some football.

39:56.040 --> 39:57.871
- Little bit.
- Where?

39:58.080 --> 40:00.833
- Oklahoma State.
- Oklahoma State U?

40:01.040 --> 40:03.634
- Prison.
- Yeah.

40:03.840 --> 40:07.037
First, we get you out of here
and on the football team.

40:07.240 --> 40:08.514
How?

40:13.320 --> 40:15.993
Well, we'll work on it.

40:19.840 --> 40:22.354
That pretty heavy?

40:25.200 --> 40:26.519
About 400 pounds.

40:27.320 --> 40:28.594
That's pretty heavy.

40:28.800 --> 40:32.554
George Samson Granada.
Mister Florida 1964.

40:33.720 --> 40:35.119
Paul Crewe.

40:35.320 --> 40:37.117
- You know Florida?
- Yeah.

40:37.320 --> 40:41.359
Yeah, they got tough cops here.
Small, but tough.

40:41.560 --> 40:44.358
We're getting up a football game
against the guards.

40:44.560 --> 40:49.839
Wondered if you and some of your
buddies here would like to join in.

40:50.040 --> 40:52.793
With the guards?

40:54.560 --> 40:55.834
I'd like that.

40:57.960 --> 41:00.235
- Sign him up.
- I'm way ahead of you.

41:00.440 --> 41:03.034
- See you around.
- Look forward to it.

41:07.560 --> 41:09.312
Samson, huh?

41:11.280 --> 41:13.191
- Samson.
- Don't cut your hair.

41:13.920 --> 41:15.831
What do you think?

41:16.040 --> 41:19.589
Defensively, we can hold them
to two or three touchdowns.

41:19.800 --> 41:23.759
But we need better pass receiving
and more speed to win.

41:27.720 --> 41:29.119
To win?

41:30.920 --> 41:34.595
I'm just talking about surviving.
Who's talking about winning?

41:34.800 --> 41:40.033
So am I. This isn't just
a football game to the warden.

41:40.240 --> 41:43.630
He shows you and this team up,
he's showing up all the prisoners.

41:45.400 --> 41:46.958
It's just a game.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.754
All I want is to survive it.
It's just a game.

41:51.960 --> 41:56.988
Not to him it isn't.
It's a fear and violence philosophy:

41:57.200 --> 41:59.873
A chance to be free
for a few hours,

42:00.080 --> 42:05.313
to try and be men again,
so he can destroy us.

42:06.360 --> 42:09.716
Nate, if you're thinking
about winning the game,

42:09.920 --> 42:11.558
you're as crazy as he is.

42:12.120 --> 42:13.553
Maybe so.

42:15.200 --> 42:18.317
But you spend 14 years in this tank

42:18.520 --> 42:24.277
and you realise there's only two things
they can't sweat or beat out of you.

42:24.480 --> 42:25.959
Your balls.

42:27.040 --> 42:30.749
Better hang onto them because they're
all you'll have when you get out.

42:42.120 --> 42:44.031
- Goodnight, Nate.
- Goodnight.

42:44.240 --> 42:49.439
<i>Use of toilet facilities is suspended
for two hours until repairs are complete.</i>

42:49.640 --> 42:51.198
<i>Sorry, men.</i>

43:19.560 --> 43:21.596
- Mace.
- Yeah.

43:21.800 --> 43:23.916
Follow my lead.
We're going to do this sucker.

43:24.120 --> 43:28.079
Yeah, we got a line-up, we'd jam him.

43:28.280 --> 43:31.078
Yeah, let's go
see what this boy wants.

43:32.360 --> 43:36.069
Pretty boy, we know what you want.
We don't play no ball.

43:38.280 --> 43:41.272
- Figured you did.
- We do but we don't.

43:41.480 --> 43:44.119
There it is.

43:45.440 --> 43:49.513
- Weren't you two drafted by the pros?
- The pros.

43:49.720 --> 43:53.554
I understand that, but we no longer
perform for the honkies' amusement.

43:53.760 --> 43:55.796
Hey, man, I'll play.

43:57.240 --> 43:59.117
But guarantee me that I'll start.

43:59.880 --> 44:02.633
- You got it.
- All right.

44:02.840 --> 44:05.434
What's wrong with you, nigger?
We don't fuck with them.

44:06.160 --> 44:09.038
- I'm going to play football.
- But not with them honkies.

44:09.800 --> 44:11.711
You better leave. We'll talk later.

44:13.040 --> 44:17.989
Yeah, leave. You look better
going than you did coming, anyway.

44:18.200 --> 44:20.395
What's wrong with you?

44:20.600 --> 44:22.556
I'm going to play football.

44:22.760 --> 44:25.672
- Look, brother...
- I ain't your goddamn brother.

44:25.880 --> 44:30.874
You know what, Granville? You're nothing
but a big old dumb stupid fool.

44:31.080 --> 44:35.949
Makes more sense for me to be
busting their heads, than busting yours.

44:36.160 --> 44:38.435
Oh, nigger, please. Shit.

44:39.880 --> 44:41.871
Where are they?

44:42.080 --> 44:45.197
They're not due for another
five minutes. What's the matter?

44:46.640 --> 44:48.278
We're in big trouble.

44:48.480 --> 44:51.916
I don't even know if these clowns
played high school football,

44:52.120 --> 44:54.111
and we're playing a semi-pro team.

44:54.320 --> 44:57.232
Plus, I haven't touched
a ball in seven years.

44:58.280 --> 45:01.078
Don't worry.
Once you've got it, you've got it.

45:01.280 --> 45:04.511
Throw one at that tyre over there.
It's just like making love.

45:04.720 --> 45:06.790
Once you've done it,
you never forget how.

45:14.720 --> 45:15.994
See?

45:16.200 --> 45:20.751
All right, men. We're not going to have
time to run any complicated patterns.

45:21.320 --> 45:24.073
So we're going to concentrate
on the basic plays.

45:24.280 --> 45:30.389
But we might learn a few "specialty
plays", if you know what I mean.

45:37.280 --> 45:40.829
Naturally, we're going to try to get
away with as much as possible.

45:41.040 --> 45:46.876
My executive assistant, Mr Nate
Scarboro, will be more than happy

45:47.640 --> 45:52.919
to show you just exactly how much
you can try to get away with.

45:56.640 --> 46:02.033
The one thing that you're going to have
to remember, the most important factor,

46:02.240 --> 46:05.198
is to protect your quarterback, me.

46:06.520 --> 46:09.751
Wait a minute. That's no bullshit.

46:09.960 --> 46:12.269
If anything happens to me,

46:12.480 --> 46:18.191
if I get hurt, we're going to have to live
with the fact that we had one chance,

46:18.400 --> 46:22.678
one chance in a million,
to humiliate those bastards,

46:22.880 --> 46:24.598
and we blew it.

46:26.760 --> 46:29.911
- Is that clear?
- Yeah!

46:30.120 --> 46:32.998
All right.
We're going to hurt them, right?

46:33.200 --> 46:34.713
Right!

46:34.920 --> 46:38.959
All right. We're going to kick
the shit out of them, right?

46:39.160 --> 46:41.355
- Right!
- What?

46:41.560 --> 46:42.879
Right!

46:43.080 --> 46:45.036
Right, right, all right!

46:45.240 --> 46:48.835
Now, backs and ends come with me,
the rest stay here.

46:50.800 --> 46:55.920
OK, linemen. Come on, linemen.
Come on out here.

46:57.360 --> 46:59.999
- What's the agility rating?
- Maximum is 10.

47:00.200 --> 47:04.751
All right, just hit the holes, I don't
want to hear you hit any rubber.

47:04.960 --> 47:06.837
Knees high!

47:07.040 --> 47:10.953
Come on, let's go, let's go...
That's a two.

47:11.160 --> 47:13.720
Let's go! Very good! Knees high!

47:13.920 --> 47:18.118
Seven.
Let's go! Hubba, hubba! Knees high!

47:18.320 --> 47:21.312
OK, let's move over
to the blocking dummies.

47:21.520 --> 47:25.195
Come on, Sonny. Sonny, over here.

47:26.480 --> 47:27.913
All right, Granny.

47:32.960 --> 47:36.032
- What do I give Granny?
- Six.

47:40.680 --> 47:41.954
Seven.

47:46.640 --> 47:51.395
- Would that be a ten?
- That's a ten.

47:51.600 --> 47:54.831
All right. I want
to see you really hit.

47:55.040 --> 47:57.793
On three. Hut one.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.355
Hut two. Hut three!

48:08.760 --> 48:11.911
All right.
Let's protect the passer this time.

48:15.200 --> 48:16.474
Good idea!

48:19.200 --> 48:20.952
Set!

48:21.160 --> 48:23.958
Hut one. Hut two. Hut three!

48:29.440 --> 48:33.433
- Sorry, man.
- Nice tackle.

48:35.640 --> 48:37.437
Hey, Coach.

48:37.640 --> 48:40.200
Where are all those
specialists you promised me?

48:43.280 --> 48:45.236
Jesus Christ!

48:46.000 --> 48:48.468
There he is, Connie Shokner.

48:48.880 --> 48:51.075
The very baddest cat in the joint.

48:51.280 --> 48:53.475
Even the guards are terrified of him.

48:53.680 --> 48:58.708
He killed five people on the outside
and two in here, with his bare hands.

48:58.920 --> 49:00.433
That karate's bad.

49:00.640 --> 49:04.349
- That's before he learned karate.
- Oh.

49:11.160 --> 49:12.878
What's he doing now?

49:13.080 --> 49:15.548
Nobody's ever had the guts to ask him.

49:15.760 --> 49:18.399
Paul. Paul.

49:18.960 --> 49:22.589
- I smell a rat.
- Hello, Unger.

49:23.160 --> 49:24.673
Paul.

49:24.880 --> 49:26.950
I've got something
important to ask you.

49:27.760 --> 49:29.432
I want to be manager.

49:29.640 --> 49:34.156
- Caretaker's manager.
- I'm better than him. Let me prove it.

49:34.360 --> 49:37.477
- Beat it, Unger.
- Fuck off!

49:39.880 --> 49:42.952
Paul, why don't you like me?

49:43.160 --> 49:45.833
I'm crazy about you.
I think you're terrific.

49:47.120 --> 49:52.353
Friendship is something that
should never be taken lightly, Paul.

49:54.160 --> 49:59.029
I really want people to like me,
but they never do.

50:03.000 --> 50:08.154
I'd like very much
to be your friend, Paul.

50:11.320 --> 50:15.552
Well, it would be an honour
and a privilege, Unger.

50:15.760 --> 50:18.752
Now, if you'll just excuse me.

50:18.960 --> 50:20.234
Paul.

50:21.800 --> 50:26.510
You sure about that?
I can't be manager?

50:26.720 --> 50:29.109
Caretaker's manager.

50:29.320 --> 50:33.393
If I'd have only found you sooner,
you know?

50:34.040 --> 50:38.238
Good thing he loves you. He burnt
to death five people he didn't like.

50:38.440 --> 50:40.158
Putty in my hands.

50:43.960 --> 50:46.315
Come out, boy. Come out.

50:57.680 --> 50:58.954
Hello, Mister Shokner.

51:03.640 --> 51:06.074
- Know how to play football?
- Yeah.

51:07.000 --> 51:11.039
Good. Would you like to play football
with us inmates?

51:11.720 --> 51:14.188
- No.
- Oh.

51:17.160 --> 51:18.832
We're playing the guards.

51:24.000 --> 51:25.752
Yeah. I want to play.

51:26.760 --> 51:28.557
He wants to play.

51:28.760 --> 51:30.796
Thank you, Mister Shokner.

51:31.600 --> 51:35.388
Now, remember,
nobody hits the quarterback.

51:35.600 --> 51:37.477
Blue 28!

51:39.160 --> 51:41.230
Set! Hut!

51:51.840 --> 51:54.513
He broke my fucking nose!

51:54.960 --> 51:57.793
You bastard,
you broke my fucking nose!

51:58.000 --> 51:59.592
Calm down. I'll fix it.

52:01.200 --> 52:03.475
I don't want to play this game.

52:03.680 --> 52:07.719
- He broke my nose.
- I'm going to fix it, OK? Here we go.

52:17.280 --> 52:21.193
- How does it look?
- It looks 100% better, doesn't it?

52:21.400 --> 52:23.789
- 100%.
- It does?

52:24.000 --> 52:25.433
Yeah.

52:30.120 --> 52:32.680
- He did that on purpose.
- No, he didn't.

52:33.400 --> 52:36.836
- Yes, he did.
- Tell him you...

52:39.400 --> 52:41.356
Tell him you're sorry.

52:41.560 --> 52:42.834
Please.

52:45.200 --> 52:49.876
OK. I'm sorry.

52:50.080 --> 52:52.719
OK, everybody.
Huddle up, let's go.

52:54.240 --> 52:55.514
He said sorry.

52:55.720 --> 52:57.995
- Bullshit!
- He said he was sorry.

52:58.200 --> 52:59.599
You dumb pussy!

53:01.080 --> 53:06.791
- Try it again.
- Three, twenty-five, hut, hut!

53:13.120 --> 53:16.078
All right.
What about the rest of the team?

53:16.680 --> 53:19.956
Outside of Crewe, the only one
who looks like anything is Granville.

53:20.160 --> 53:23.436
- Granville could give you real trouble.
- All right, that's all.

53:40.480 --> 53:43.438
- Well?
- It's going to be a turkey shoot.

53:43.640 --> 53:46.074
He's right, sir.
We're going to destroy 'em.

53:46.280 --> 53:48.396
It's a cinch, boss. A cinch.

53:49.320 --> 53:50.594
Cinch.

53:50.800 --> 53:52.074
Destroy 'em.

53:53.960 --> 53:56.155
Too cute.

54:00.720 --> 54:04.269
That's what you said last year before
we lost to Endicott Steel, remember?

54:06.080 --> 54:10.517
There's no sense us taking any chances,
letting ourselves get hurt.

54:10.720 --> 54:14.349
- So see what we can do about Granville.
- Yes, sir.

54:14.880 --> 54:16.950
Granville, get your ass over here.

54:25.320 --> 54:26.878
Yes, sir, Lieutenant.

54:29.640 --> 54:32.074
What the hell
you think you're doing, boy?

54:32.280 --> 54:34.032
You pick that up.

54:41.080 --> 54:42.672
Yes, sir.

54:42.880 --> 54:46.509
What is your problem, fat man?

54:46.720 --> 54:49.712
Know why you spades always
calling each other "brother"?

54:50.320 --> 54:51.594
No, sir.

54:51.800 --> 54:55.873
'Cause half of you don't know who your
daddy is, so you might be brothers.

55:06.440 --> 55:07.793
Yes, sir, Lieutenant.

55:08.440 --> 55:11.193
- You think that's funny?
- Yes, sir.

55:11.400 --> 55:13.118
You want to hit me, don't you?

55:13.880 --> 55:15.552
No, sir, Lieutenant.

55:15.760 --> 55:22.279
You're too ignorant to know when a man's
calling you a stupid, uneducated nigger.

55:27.840 --> 55:32.231
Yes, sir, Lieutenant.
May I go now, sir?

55:32.440 --> 55:35.193
Yeah, get out of my sight.

55:51.920 --> 55:54.195
Blue 48!

55:55.400 --> 55:57.311
Blue 48!

55:59.280 --> 56:01.840
Set!
Hut one!

56:08.280 --> 56:10.077
Shit.

56:13.880 --> 56:15.518
Hey, lightweight.

56:17.280 --> 56:18.759
What the hell is this?

56:18.960 --> 56:20.359
Here come the rain-clouds.

56:21.000 --> 56:22.638
What do they want?

56:24.040 --> 56:28.875
Granny tells us you need a little help.
Says you can guarantee no work detail.

56:32.560 --> 56:35.950
- Yeah.
- Guarantee special food like Granny gets?

56:36.320 --> 56:37.594
Yeah.

56:37.800 --> 56:40.155
We get to hit those guards
like Granny said?

56:40.560 --> 56:43.870
You get to hit 'em.

56:47.000 --> 56:48.718
What else can we offer them?

56:48.920 --> 56:51.309
...having a Geneva conference
about playing with us.

56:52.200 --> 56:54.111
What is this bullshit?

56:56.000 --> 56:57.274
Well, Mister Crewe.

56:58.360 --> 56:59.839
We've come to terms.

57:00.480 --> 57:02.789
Compliments from
the Greater Chicago Youth Authority.

57:03.000 --> 57:04.718
There goes the neighbourhood.

57:26.920 --> 57:28.911
You wanted to see me?

57:29.120 --> 57:30.792
Yes, sir.

57:34.080 --> 57:36.640
...especially Unger.

57:36.840 --> 57:38.398
- Unger?
- Yes.

57:38.600 --> 57:42.673
Unger has a direct pipeline
to Captain Knauer.

57:42.880 --> 57:46.759
It's impossible for me to have
a secret practice while Unger's around.

57:49.040 --> 57:52.271
I'm supposed
to reschedule the yard activities

57:52.480 --> 57:56.189
for three uninterrupted hours
of secret practice?

57:56.400 --> 57:58.834
- That right?
- Yes, sir. Right.

57:59.040 --> 58:01.076
And you will talk to Captain Knauer?

58:01.280 --> 58:05.512
- I'll speak to the captain on matters.
- Thank you, sir.

58:06.840 --> 58:08.319
Mister Crewe.

58:08.520 --> 58:11.239
Just what is it you
have up your sleeve?

58:11.760 --> 58:15.196
I'm just trying to give you
a football team, Warden.

58:15.400 --> 58:21.316
And along the way, maybe give the men
some pride and some dignity.

58:21.520 --> 58:23.988
Of course, only for a little while.

58:26.360 --> 58:31.036
I know you've got something more
bouncing around inside that head of yours.

58:33.000 --> 58:35.309
You want a game, right?

58:36.640 --> 58:40.110
My men don't have a chance in hell
of winning that game.

58:40.320 --> 58:44.836
You know it, I know it,
I just don't want them to know it.

58:45.480 --> 58:46.959
OK?

58:52.800 --> 58:56.554
Man! I ain't had steak
like this in five years!

58:57.120 --> 58:58.838
I ain't eaten inside in six!

59:03.000 --> 59:05.594
What have you done for me lately?

59:05.800 --> 59:09.588
Today may be the high point
of a long and colourful career.

59:09.800 --> 59:13.031
Three, count 'em,
three gigantic rip-offs.

59:13.240 --> 59:17.233
First, I've got a box of brand new
equipment waiting to be stashed.

59:17.440 --> 59:19.954
- Compliments of Captain Knauer?
- No less.

59:20.160 --> 59:22.435
<i>And the piece de resistance:</i>

59:22.640 --> 59:27.555
How would you like actual game films
of the guardsmen in action?

59:27.760 --> 59:31.116
- Can you do that?
- Warden's own home movies.

59:31.320 --> 59:33.356
Caretaker, you never cease
to amaze me.

59:33.760 --> 59:37.196
Never. But you said
three gigantic rip-offs.

59:37.400 --> 59:38.913
That's only two.

59:39.120 --> 59:41.998
- You don't want to ruin the surprise.
- Surprise?

59:42.200 --> 59:43.872
- There's one thing.
- What?

59:44.920 --> 59:49.277
You're going to have to perform
a personal service.

59:54.120 --> 59:55.917
What kind of personal service?

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.549
The warden's expecting you.
Won't you come this way.

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:10.910
- Thank you, Captain.
- Thank you.

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:23.155
I'm glad you're not in the swamp
anymore. That can ruin a man.

01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:24.839
Sure can.

01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:29.670
We don't have a great deal of time.
We have 15 minutes.

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:35.431
- The game films.
- Thank you. That's terrific.

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:42.955
Like I said, we only have 15 minutes.

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:05.910
Uh-uh. Won't go over the cuffs.

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:14.559
You do this very often?

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:17.513
I'm as far from Tallahassee
as you are, honey.

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:27.674
Shokner.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.551
- Shokner.
- Yep.

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:35.593
Hit him high like that,
he'll break your back.

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:40.149
Breaks your back, he's going
to break the Superstar's back.

01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:45.516
Don't worry about him. I'll get
that son of a bitch with an empi.

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:47.273
Kiai!

01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:49.710
- Ready! Set!
- Kiai!

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:52.595
- Ready! Set!
- Kiai!

01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:54.434
Take this bandage,

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.036
dip it into the plaster of Paris,

01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:01.836
wrap it around the cast,
and in 15 minutes it's hard as rock.

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:04.110
- Got it?
- Got it.

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:08.359
- This is a picture of Walking Boss.
- Yeah!

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:11.916
He once broke his right thigh-bone,
maybe you can clip it.

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:13.917
- We'll break it again!
- Got it?

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:17.396
- Got it!
- All right. We can do it!

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:20.194
Gentlemen, what we have here,
in common parlance,

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:23.756
is known as a set of brass knuckles.

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:26.315
...temporary disabilities.

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:29.592
Balls. Gut. Ribs.

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:31.631
- You got it?
- Got it!

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:34.274
...the ball is snapped,
you go into your opponent,

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:39.315
blocking him with your left arm
and bring this hand up into his chin,

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:44.071
and I'll guarantee he'll be incapacitated
for the next several moments.

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:46.589
- Got it?
- Got it!

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:49.712
All right. Here's the play
we're going to use.

01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:51.956
I don't think the guards
know this formation.

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:56.429
It's called "Incidental punishment
after the ball is blown dead".

01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:02.875
Any man you tackle gets an extra elbow,
knee, or kick in the mouth. Got it?

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:04.354
Got it!

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:12.751
I am, without a doubt,

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:17.750
the finest maker of raisin jack
in the entire joint.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:22.158
I'm going to call this batch
"Old Caretaker".

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:24.555
Do you always keep it in there?

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:28.639
Well, it seems like a logical place.

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:35.916
- Listen...
- It does get to you.

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:39.271
...you and me are buddies, ain't we?
I got you laid.

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:46.155
I got you the game film. I got you all
them monsters. I'm getting you drunk.

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:49.156
Yes, you are.

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:53.557
- There's one thing still bothers me.
- What's that?

01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:56.153
Why'd you shave them points?

01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:01.556
I told you, for the money.

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:06.759
No, no. Come on.
Give me the real reason.

01:04:08.160 --> 01:04:10.754
You really want to know, huh?

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:14.795
I never gave a shit about football,

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.639
or anything else.

01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:22.231
The only thing
I ever cared about's my old man.

01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:28.157
My old man was blind,
never saw me play.

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:34.952
Shit, I've been a professional
ever since I was 12 years old.

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:37.913
Hustling nickels and
dimes playing pool.

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:44.069
Didn't make enough money
to take care of him.

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:50.150
And I figured when I got to pro ball,
I'd make one big killing.

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:53.396
One big one.

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:57.999
Make enough money to set him up,

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:03.553
take care of him the rest of his life.

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:05.637
Then the son of a bitch died.

01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:12.954
Do you buy that?

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:17.635
Well, that's good
because it's bullshit.

01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:26.556
Why do you think I shaved points?

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.955
For the money.

01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:37.076
<i>One minute to lock-up. One minute.</i>

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:38.998
Know what my problem's
always been?

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.316
No, what?

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:45.308
I've always had my shit together.
Always.

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:50.998
My problem has been
that I couldn't lift it.

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:57.632
I've got to go home.

01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:00.798
Oh, you're going to be a party pooper?

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:05.039
It's OK. Some pro quarterbacks
drink all night long.

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:07.754
I know.

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:09.598
Goodnight.

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:15.033
Goodnight, Paul. Here,
don't you want to take one with you?

01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:17.678
<i>Lock it up!</i>

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:21.555
<i>- Lock it up!
- Lock it up now.</i>

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:24.399
<i>Lock up. Turn off radios.</i>

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:30.557
<i>- Turn off the radio.
- Lock it up!</i>

01:06:35.840 --> 01:06:38.229
Come on, boy. Move.

01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:40.112
Want to be tucked in?

01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:45.869
There's nothing I can do for you,
Crewe got to the warden.

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:50.232
Captain, if you put me back in the general
population, one of those guys'll kill me.

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:54.194
That's what happens to finks.
You've got Crewe to thank for that.

01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:56.633
He blew the whistle on you.

01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:58.997
On you specifically.

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:02.600
- You got the problem.
- I can help you!

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:07.830
Split right. Full back, dive right.
On one, ready?

01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:11.271
Go left! Go left! Go round!

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:14.718
Twenty-eight.

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:18.039
Hut!

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:21.830
Way to go, way to go!

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:41.599
- Let's go!
- Set!

01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:43.474
Hut!

01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:47.872
All right.

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:01.837
<i>General call for lock-up.</i>

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:08.036
<i>- Let's do it! That's my team!
- All prisoners return to their cells.</i>

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:11.312
<i>Shop period 5 will begin in 10 minutes.</i>

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:17.515
<i>In ten minutes, we expect all men in
shop period 5 to meet outside cell block...</i>

01:08:22.319 --> 01:08:26.279
<i>Cell block 3A
will take first call for dinner.</i>

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:34.468
<i>Dinner rotation
will start with cell block 3A.</i>

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.917
We don't know enough
about these guys.

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:41.078
Why don't we take another look
at the X-rays?

01:08:41.279 --> 01:08:44.828
The medical files are on my bed,
get them, will you?

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:48.350
- Who do you see playing flanker?
- Miller.

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:17.719
Get the goddamn key!

01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:20.319
Warden! Warden!

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:22.198
Bring that key!

01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:27.951
Come on, get him out of there.

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:29.913
Earth to earth,

01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.236
ashes to ashes,

01:09:32.439 --> 01:09:34.510
dust to dust,

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:39.032
we commend the soul
of James "Caretaker" Farrell.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.437
And now, the peace of God
which passeth all understanding,

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:48.113
shall guard your hearts and souls.

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:54.550
Unto our God and Father
be glory for ever and ever.

01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:56.991
Amen.

All right. Stand up for the warden.

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:02.518
Just so you'll know,

01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:05.792
we've posted armed guards
all along the wall

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.833
and at the public end of the field.

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:13.875
So if any of you were thinking
of mingling with the civilians

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:17.595
and wandering off with the crowd
at the end of the game,

01:11:21.160 --> 01:11:24.311
we will shoot you.

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:29.193
Have a nice game, boys.

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:40.638
See you on the field, Superstar.

01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:09.154
All right, now it's our turn.

01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:11.876
Here's a surprise from the Caretaker.

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:18.318
Come on. Come on.

01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:28.118
<i>Born free</i>

What are you dressed up for,
Hallowe'en?

01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:16.192
I figured if you get far enough ahead, you'd
let this middle-aged kid have some fun.

01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:18.755
Bullshit!

01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:20.359
- Call it.
- Heads.

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:23.836
It is a head.
You've won the toss and may elect to...

01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:25.917
How did you steal our uniforms?

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:27.874
Cute, aren't they?

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:29.832
Have a good clean game.

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:31.598
So no matter what,

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:34.629
just keep sticking it to them.

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:37.957
- Now, who are we?
- The Mean Machine.

01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:39.957
The Mean Machine.

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:41.878
Mean Machine.

01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:43.559
Mean Machine.

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:47.116
Mean Machine.

01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:52.512
Hit that dirt!

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.513
One, two, one, two.

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:20.998
<i>- Ready, go!
- Hold them out and don't let 'em score</i>

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:24.836
<i>Check them out
Hold them out and don't let 'em score</i>

01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:26.553
<i>Check them out
Hold them out</i>

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:29.274
<i>and don't let 'em score</i>

01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:31.232
Three. Twenty-five.

01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:33.358
Hut! Hut!

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:38.792
<i>Kick was blocked by Granville.</i>

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:45.513
<i>The score now is Guardsmen 6,
Mean Machine 0.</i>

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:47.753
<i>Guardsmen kick off.</i>

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:50.030
Good defence. Way to go.

01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:53.838
Here! Here!

01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:56.873
<i>At the fourth down and a prize attack.</i>

01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:59.789
<i>Mean Machine serpentines
up to the line of scrimmage.</i>

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.355
<i>Scrimmage is first and ten.</i>

01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:04.797
Tighten the line. Move it.

01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:09.919
All right, here come the bad guys.
Pick 'em up.

01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:13.796
Set!
Hut!

01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:21.234
<i>...in the end zone for two points
and a slashing tackle by number 61.</i>

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.554
- Bogdanski?
- Bogdanski.

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:27.398
Who's supposed to stop him?

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.591
- I am.
- Right.

01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:31.756
<i>...goes out there in front of him.</i>

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:34.872
<i>A free kick. Charlie Blue Eyes kicks.</i>

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:39.676
<i>Taken at the Guards' 40.</i>

01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:44.271
<i>And he goes down
for an 18-yard drop back.</i>

01:16:57.160 --> 01:17:01.119
<i>He's dropped for a five-yard loss,
by number 66, Wilbur Gillan.</i>

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:07.078
<i>...and he's fumbled.</i>

01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:12.034
<i>A Machine ball on their own 32.</i>

01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:14.071
<i>He's making the pass.</i>

01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:17.352
<i>He's hit by a vicious
diving tackle by Bogdanski.</i>

01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:28.873
<i>It's going to be a penalty for
Bogdanksi for hitting before the pass.</i>

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:34.434
<i>So ladies and gentlemen, that
signals the end of the first quarter.</i>

01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:40.036
<i>...Mean Machine nothing.</i>

01:17:42.440 --> 01:17:44.396
<i>Ball goes back to Crewe,
he's waiting to pass...</i>

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:55.794
<i>Scores!</i>

01:17:56.760 --> 01:17:58.159
Damn!

01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:11.799
Settle down. Good hands. Here we go.

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:16.073
Loose showboat on the centre snap.
We're going to fake it. Ready?

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:22.388
And the Mean Machine will now line up
for the touchdown attempt.

01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:35.435
<i>That makes the score eight to seven
in favour of the Guardsmen.</i>

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.719
Listen, guys. If they fake
the Walking Boss, cover me.

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:45.791
- I gotta get that bastard.
- Bury that son of a bitch.

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:51.080
<i>First and ten on their own 31.</i>

01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:56.115
<i>Wilhelm Knauer. He's dropped
for a two-yard loss on the 29-yard line.</i>

01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:01.115
Give me the brass knuckles.

01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:16.518
Take a good whiff.
Take a good whiff. How many fingers?

01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:18.756
- Three.
- Great.

01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:23.830
If that Levitt comes up the middle
again, I'm going to clothesline him.

01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:25.314
Now's the time.

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:30.799
- Four three Mau Mau. Ready?
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:39.119
Receiver. Set! Hut!

01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:41.276
<i>Ball goes to Knauer...</i>

01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:48.109
<i>Levitt was clotheslined,
and he is not moving.</i>

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:52.272
I think I broke his fucking neck.

01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:03.232
I think he broke his fucking neck.

01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:06.000
I told you I broke his fucking neck.

01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:10.511
I think he broke his fucking neck.

01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:14.156
Sonny, if Knauer drops back
to punt, nail him.

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:16.796
You bet your ass. I'll get him.

01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.558
We need the ball.

01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:24.313
<i>A little bit of safety here.
A timid or chicken kind of football.</i>

01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:28.911
<i>Ball goes to Knauer
and he's smashed down.</i>

01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:36.433
Give me a break, OK?

01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:41.191
Did you see that? Are you blind?
You're supposed to be impartial.

01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:45.029
Shit! Might as well be
a goddamn try-out for you.

01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:51.753
Third and long.
He likes to throw on the flat.

01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:35.833
<i>And the half ends with the score:
Guardsmen 15, Mean Machine 13.</i>

01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:38.395
<i>We'll have the half-time statistics
for you in a few moments,</i>

01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:43.674
but right now it's time
for our gala half-time activities.

01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:47.393
- Any suggestions, sir?
- Give your team a pep talk!

01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:49.750
Yes, sir.

01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:53.396
<i>You've got to be a football hero</i>

01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:56.797
<i>To get along with a beautiful girl</i>

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.834
<i>You gotta be a touchdown getter
you bet</i>

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:03.793
<i>If you want to get a baby to pet</i>

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:08.596
Hey, Crewe!
What kind of football you call that?

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:10.358
Same kind you're playing.

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:14.269
We've let you mothers slide,
now we're going to hang you out to dry.

01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:16.596
Hey, Wilhelm. Hang loose.

01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:23.353
Those bastards were good.

01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:25.755
- Come on, damn it.
- Let's go.

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:37.995
Call yourselves a football team?
Bunch of candy-asses.

01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:40.555
They're laughing at you next door.
Listen.

01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:47.156
What about Mawabe!
He's a bigshot, man...

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:04.669
Just what the hell
do you think you're doing?

01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:07.155
You wanted a game, you got one.

01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:08.793
I never mentioned winning.

01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:11.271
You never said
anything about losing, either.

01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:15.633
I'll spell it out.

01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:18.633
We've got Unger in custody.

01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:22.150
- He's confessed to killing Caretaker.
- What?

01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:24.510
He said you knew all about it.

01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:26.870
But you didn't notify Captain Knauer.

01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:30.789
And that makes you an accessory.

01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:37.029
- You're full of crap.
- You sent Caretaker to that cell.

01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:39.955
You are an accessory to murder.

01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:44.395
You could be looking at twenty years,
and counting.

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:47.353
Bullshit! There's no way
that would stick in court.

01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:53.715
No? Mister Crewe, you could be in this
institution until you're old and grey,

01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:58.391
or until you're dead, whichever's
first, I can promise you that.

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:04.516
You're going to lose the game.
And I want a 21-point spread.

01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:08.399
I can't do that.

01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:13.679
Of course you can.

01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:16.476
You've done it before.

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:23.711
If I give you the 21 points,

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:27.916
will you call off the dogs?

01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:33.749
The dogs?

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:38.795
If you've got the game in the bag,
you tell your guys to coast.

01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:43.876
I don't want any of my men hurt.

01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:50.675
You have my word.

01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:53.269
Once we get the 21 points.

01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:00.192
You know, there's only one thing
I'm sorry about.

01:25:00.400 --> 01:25:01.674
What's that?

01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:04.269
That you're not playing,
knocking heads.

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:09.958
I'm afraid I'm a little
too old for that.

01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:13.755
No. You never had the guts
to begin with.

01:25:21.200 --> 01:25:25.193
You're playing like a bunch of girls.
Every one of you. Candy-asses.

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:29.229
You know who's beating you out there?

01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:32.113
Scum's beating you out there. Scum.

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:34.914
And that's the lowest
part of the world.

01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:38.032
Those are the criminals
and rapists. The murderers.

01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:39.912
You're supposed
to represent law and order.

01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:43.678
- You're supposed to...
- Listen to this shit.

01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:45.393
He thinks he's Rockne.

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:47.238
You're letting the flag down.

01:25:47.440 --> 01:25:51.319
Go out there and do something about it.
Offence and defence play together.

01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:54.432
Let's go now. Come on!

01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:14.516
- You're guaranteed a 21-point spread.
- What?

01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:17.678
Because of your performance,
I was forced to make a deal.

01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:20.596
In the second half we can beat them.

01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:24.429
I don't care what you think.
You'll do as I told you.

01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:26.358
Mister Crewe will do the same.

01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:27.874
Yes, sir.

01:26:30.200 --> 01:26:33.875
When you and your mental midgets
are 21 points ahead,

01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:38.392
I want you to inflict as much painful
damage on the prisoners as possible.

01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:43.437
So you understand,
before this game is over,

01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:49.158
I want every prisoner in this institution
to know what I mean by power,

01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:51.590
and who controls it.

01:26:53.160 --> 01:26:55.993
Do we understand each other?

01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:58.555
Yes, sir.

01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:05.354
<i>It's 15- 13</i>

01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:11.556
<i>and the second half of a surprisingly
close ball game is about to begin.</i>

01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:17.711
<i>...ball goes down
and is taken by number 36.</i>

01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:28.193
Set! Hut!

01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:31.676
<i>...goes straight back, he's getting good
protection and is looking for the receiver.</i>

01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:34.269
Throw the ball, man.
I'm open. Crewe!

01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:36.194
Crewe!

01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:40.238
Crewe!

01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:44.111
Crewe! Oh, shit!

01:27:46.680 --> 01:27:50.468
- I own that hamburger. Pass it.
- I was open. Can't you see?

01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:52.113
Enough. I'm calling the plays.

01:27:56.680 --> 01:27:58.193
Hut!

01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:15.435
<i>First and ten for the Guards
in opposition territory.</i>

01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:17.437
All right. No sweat.

01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:19.790
<i>Crewe has been poor
in this last series of plays.</i>

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.991
<i>Something seems
to have happened to him.</i>

01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:25.670
<i>That last pass wasjust not
a Paul Crewe pass.</i>

01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:28.755
Come on, we'll get it back.

01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:37.673
<i>Touchdown!</i>

01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:46.837
Stick it to 'em. He's going to choke.

01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:55.238
<i>Paul Crewe looking to pass.
Gets a pass off and it's short.</i>

01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:57.715
<i>It's short and it's picked off
by number 21.</i>

01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:02.158
We got it! We got it!

01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:06.553
<i>It's another touchdown for the Guards,
bringing their score to 28,</i>

01:29:06.760 --> 01:29:08.591
<i>to thirteen for the Mean Machine.</i>

01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:12.711
- What's happening?
- I'm having a bad day.

01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:16.276
- Bad day?
- Yes. Have you never had one?

01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:18.789
Get off my back.

01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:25.392
Set! Hut!

01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:30.952
<i>- Ball snaps back and there's a fumble...
- Fumble, fumble!</i>

01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:34.197
- What is that?
- You call yourself good!

01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:37.836
Why did you change uniform?
Bullshit.

01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:44.717
Paul Crewe
is taking himself out of the ball game.

01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:49.109
<i>Paul Crewe is limping badly.
He's limping off the field.</i>

01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:52.153
Pop Steadman's
bringing him to the bench.

01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:55.511
<i>We may have seen
the last of Paul Crewe for today.</i>

01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:10.793
Let's get this shoe off
and look at that ankle.

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:14.390
I could give him one of my empis.
I'd knock his head off.

01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:16.318
I could be inside making wallets.

01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:21.310
Doesn't feel broken. Somebody
step on it or did you twist it?

01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:24.592
- Twisted it.
- Golden boy? Superstar?

01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:28.790
To think we fought Granny for this crap.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.309
Really sold us out, didn't you, Crewe?

01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:34.273
Anybody can see
he's throwing the game.

01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:36.630
<i>Pull 'em down, go, let's go.</i>

01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:39.399
Let's go.

01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:43.229
<i>...at the line of scrimmage.
Less than an inch for a touchdown.</i>

01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:46.477
<i>The ball is going back to Keller...</i>

01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:51.558
<i>A touchdown for the Guards,
making the score 35 to 13.</i>

01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:57.869
<i>With 5 minutes 58 left in the third
quarter, which has been all Guardsmen,</i>

01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:05.512
<i>the score is 35 for the Guardsmen
and 13 for the Mean Machine.</i>

01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:08.034
No point.

01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:10.596
<i>With 5.58 left in the third period,</i>

01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:15.396
<i>the score remains 35 for the Guardsmen
and 13 for the Mean Machine.</i>

01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:21.836
Kill that Indian mother! Get that
Indian by the boots! Get him over!

01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:28.829
Good blocking.
Keep it up. Keep it up.

01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:30.314
Come on now.

01:31:31.480 --> 01:31:35.678
<i>Guards'ball, third and two
on their own 37-yard line.</i>

01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:40.318
<i>Knauer takes the pass
and throws it to Levitt...</i>

01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:45.594
<i>...Levitt takes the ball and he's going
to the Mean Machine 30-yard line...</i>

01:31:46.880 --> 01:31:50.077
...on me.
Jesus Christ! Another injury.

01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:52.555
Come on.

01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:57.959
<i>...number 74, Shop Steward, is badly
hurt, bleeding badly from the mouth.</i>

01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:01.709
<i>...ball goes back to Knauer, who
hands off 11 for another long gain.</i>

01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:04.312
<i>...another injury...</i>

01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:10.950
<i>...and it's Sonny Tannen.
He seems to be badly shaken up.</i>

01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:17.870
Crybaby son of a bitch!

01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:22.951
Time! Another man down.

01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:34.990
Superstar, what kind of deal did you
make this time? What did Hazen promise?

01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:40.749
They're killing those guys out there
and you don't even care.

01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:51.273
He's right, Crewe.
You fooled the hell out of me.

01:32:51.480 --> 01:32:53.596
I trusted you
and you let me down.

01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:59.755
I know you don't give a shit about nothing,
but I didn't think you'd sell us out.

01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:04.752
Granny,
better get back in there.

01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:12.512
Four three inside flank.
Ready? Break.

01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:17.670
<i>Ball's on the Mean Machine
48-yard line.</i>

01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:21.156
<i>...ball's gone to Knauer,
he hands off 44...</i>

01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:23.999
<i>...he's picking one up...</i>

01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:36.757
- What is it?
- Broken collarbone.

01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:38.916
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:44.114
<i>Officials are trying to break up that
fight, getting pretty rough in there.</i>

01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:52.709
<i>Granny Granville is hurt. He's holding
his shoulder and appears to be badly hurt.</i>

01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:56.674
<i>Probably a broken bone,
but he is on his feet.</i>

01:33:58.880 --> 01:34:00.836
Satisfied now?

01:34:04.960 --> 01:34:06.234
Jesus, Sonny!

01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:11.275
<i>The officials will assess the penalty.
15 yards for unsporting conduct.</i>

01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:17.837
- Hey, Pop.
- Yeah?

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:22.549
That time you hit Hazen in the mouth,
was it worth it?

01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:27.234
Was it worth 30 years?

01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:29.556
Yeah. For me it was.

01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:35.314
Well, give me my goddamn shoe.

01:34:41.640 --> 01:34:42.914
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:48.956
<i>Paul Crewe, number 22, is going back
into the game for the Mean Machine.</i>

01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:54.951
All right. New quarterback. Shok, you're
on the bench. Move over. Here we go.

01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:59.349
- Makes no difference where you go.
- Fuck you.

01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:01.790
Look who's back.
It's the baby boy.

01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:09.552
- Set!
- Set, my ass.

01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:12.958
What is he trying to pull?

01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:15.994
- Hut!
- Uh-uh.

01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:19.431
Get that Superstar.

01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:21.915
<i>Behind the line of scrimmage
for a six-yard goal.</i>

01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:30.109
Show 'em who's boss.
Get them. They ain't shit.

01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:34.872
That's how it is?

01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:38.993
<i>They're in a huddle now. There's
the gun ending the third quarter.</i>

01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:43.072
That's the quarter.
Let's change ends.

01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:50.071
<i>Ball goes to Crewe. He's going to
pass on fourth and long-yard it.</i>

01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:52.077
<i>...holds the ball
and goes up the middle.</i>

01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:53.554
<i>Crewe goes up the middle...</i>

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:00.752
That's it, Paul.

01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:06.748
<i>- The line is set...
- Hut!</i>

01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:11.909
<i>...he's going up the centre.</i>

01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:17.438
Shotgun left. Shotgun.

01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:22.356
Hut! Hut!

01:36:23.200 --> 01:36:26.875
<i>Crewe's looking for a receiver.</i>

01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:35.754
Where's he going?

01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:39.471
<i>There's a figure that graced
the Polo Grounds for years.</i>

01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:43.954
What are you guys so surprised about?

01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:46.594
I'm not letting you have all the fun.

01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:50.233
Bootleg on one.
Ready? Break.

01:36:51.040 --> 01:36:54.919
OK. Come on.
Looks good. Keep it alive.

01:36:57.120 --> 01:36:58.599
Set!

01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:02.638
Hut!

01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:12.274
<i>There's a first down
on the 20-yard line.</i>

01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:16.794
Your confidence back?

01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:20.359
- Get Scarboro.
- Son of a bitch.

01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:27.758
<i>Ball goes back to Crewe,
he's waiting to pass...</i>

01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:44.238
<i>...by Bogdanski. Bogdanski hit
Nate Scarboro a cheap shot.</i>

01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:46.396
<i>A reprehensible action.</i>

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:48.752
Cheap shot!

01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:53.117
Let me at the son of a bitch.

01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:58.870
Old Double O
is down and seems badly hurt.

01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:01.757
How is it, Nate?

01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:06.670
I love it. After all these years,
my first touchdown.

01:38:07.480 --> 01:38:10.119
It's got to be his knee.
I heard it pop.

01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:13.879
- Get him up.
- You'll be OK. Hang in there.

01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:23.555
Hey, Paul. You've got to do it.

01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:28.878
- Screw Hazen!
- Don't worry. He'll get his.

01:38:31.080 --> 01:38:32.798
<i>Good old Nate Scarboro.</i>

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.878
One of the most beloved men
this institution has had.

01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:50.632
<i>The extra point kick is good.</i>

01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:53.718
<i>Tightening that score now
to 35 to 20.</i>

01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:59.358
Blue Eyes can kick the ball ten yards,
can someone fall on it?

01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:02.472
- Right on.
- Then let's go!

01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:11.152
<i>Charlie Blue Eyes approaches the ball
and kicks...</i>

01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:13.555
<i>It's an on-side kick...</i>

01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:22.432
<i>And it's recovered
for the Mean Machine.</i>

01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:28.039
Shut up. Shut up!

01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:30.071
You're stinking the place up.

01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:33.717
- Can we take 'em?
- Yeah!

01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:41.232
Split right. On two. Ready?

01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:51.153
Set!

01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:54.078
Hut!

01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:57.875
<i>Ball goes back to Crewe.
Crewe hands off to number 30...</i>

01:40:05.400 --> 01:40:08.153
<i>...23 yards.
Crewe's down on the ten-yard line.</i>

01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:10.032
A beautiful piece of razzle-dazzle.

01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:16.073
<i>Paul Crewe reached into
his bag of tricks that time, folks.</i>

01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:33.797
<i>Charlie Blue Eyes splits the uprights
and that makes it 35 to 27.</i>

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.719
- How we doing?
- Fine.

01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:39.275
There you go, Nate.

01:40:39.480 --> 01:40:42.950
I heard you were on your way in.

01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:48.832
Hey, did they tell you
about my touchdown?

01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:53.431
<i>We repeat, with five minutes and
four seconds left in the fourth quarter,</i>

01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:56.074
<i>there is now only
an eight-point difference.</i>

01:41:00.720 --> 01:41:03.837
- Here we go.
- Can you drop-kick from here?

01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:06.110
- I could try.
- Drop-kick?

01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:09.110
It's fourth and four
and we're going to drop-kick.

01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:13.029
Shotgun.
Drop-kick, on one. Ready?

01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:20.435
<i>...he's got to come up
with something different.</i>

01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:24.630
<i>Ball goes back to
Charlie Blue Eyes...</i>

01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:31.591
I haven't seen one
of those in years.

01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:35.074
- What was that?
- A drop-kick.

01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:38.511
- How much does that count?
- Three points.

01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:41.957
For that? Bullshit!

01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:46.832
<i>The score stands Guards 35,
Mean Machine 30.</i>

01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:50.316
<i>Fourth and 21
for the Mean Machine on their own 39.</i>

01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:53.034
<i>Crewe is feigning...</i>

01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:55.708
<i>...and he dumps off another pass.</i>

01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:07.269
<i>...Bogdanski saves a touchdown.</i>

01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:10.995
Bogdanski is really wreaking havoc
on that Mean Machine team.

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.434
Quiet down.
Now, listen to me.

01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:20.795
We're going to let Bogdanski come right
through. Nobody touch him. Got it?

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:25.676
I want to try something.
If it works, everybody hit him. Right?

01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:30.874
- Right.
- Split right. All curl, on one. Ready?

01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:32.914
Red left!

01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:36.039
Blue 69!

01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:38.596
Blue 69!

01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:41.792
Set!

01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:49.111
<i>...throws the ball
directly at Bogdanski's groin.</i>

01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:55.355
- Get off him.
- That's bullshit!

01:42:57.600 --> 01:43:00.114
<i>They're unravelling the tangle now,</i>

01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:03.676
and there's a penalty against
the Mean Machine for roughness,

01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:09.113
<i>and that pass sure didn't look like
it was an accident.</i>

01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:13.878
Bogdanski is staggering,
but he is up and on his feet.

01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:19.552
OK. We've got fifteenth.
Let's huddle up on the ball. Huddle up.

01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:27.514
Unbelievable.

01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:38.031
Hey, Bog.
Get out of here.

01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:40.435
- Come on.
- I know what I'm doing.

01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:44.474
- Worked once, got to work again. Right?
- Right.

01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:48.958
All right.
One more time, on two. Ready?

01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:53.119
<i>It's third and 32
for the Mean Machine.</i>

01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:01.469
Set!
Hut!

01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:03.910
<i>Ball goes back to Crewe...</i>

01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:08.034
Crewe hits Bogdanski with the ball
right in the...

01:44:08.240 --> 01:44:10.629
<i>...in the nether regions.</i>

01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:14.469
<i>Once again, Bogdanski is down,
the Mean Machine is dirty.</i>

01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:32.438
- He's not breathing.
- Do something. Try mouth-to-mouth.

01:44:33.040 --> 01:44:36.794
- You want to?
- No way.

01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:38.679
Ambulance. Help!

01:44:40.520 --> 01:44:45.878
<i>They are taking Bogdanski
off the field in an ambulance.</i>

01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:11.875
He pushed him!

01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:19.636
You can't see,
you blind son of a bitch.

01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:24.118
Hey, Walking Boss,
here's your crying towel.

01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:27.198
You big fat-assed son of a bitch.

01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:30.790
Go get off and stay off.

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:32.433
First down.

01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:34.554
Time out.

01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:36.352
Jesus!

01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:41.678
- Scooter, you want to hit somebody?
- Yeah.

01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:44.792
All right. Tackle eligible.

01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:46.831
Mawabe, talk to me.

01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:49.508
- What are you doing?
- One step off the line.

01:45:49.720 --> 01:45:51.950
- I'll step on the line.
- Right. On one. Ready?

01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:57.188
Machine's ball, first and ten
on the Guards' 31-yard line.

01:45:57.400 --> 01:45:58.833
Blue 28!

01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:01.952
<i>...less than one minute
57 seconds left.</i>

01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:04.278
Hut!

01:46:11.480 --> 01:46:13.198
Protest that play!

01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:24.953
Crewe, call time.

01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:28.876
Time. Time.
Time, ref. Time.

01:46:29.080 --> 01:46:31.878
<i>First and goal on the one-yard line,</i>

01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:34.036
as Crewe calls time out, with...

01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:37.152
<i>...40 seconds left on the clock.</i>

01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:39.828
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:43.430
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:45.358
Mean Machine!

01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:50.234
Quiet down. Split right...
Joe Jack!

01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:53.273
Split right, sweep left.
On one. Ready?

01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:58.397
Blue 28! Blue 28!

01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:00.352
Set! Hut!

01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:10.034
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is really a ball game.</i>

01:47:10.240 --> 01:47:12.276
This is a great ball team.

01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:16.439
<i>They're giving these Guardsmen
the fight of their lives.</i>

01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:23.156
Split right, roll out right,
option pass. Be waiting, Mace.

01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:25.396
On two, on two. Ready?

01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:28.558
<i>- Second and goal.
- Blue 20.</i>

01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:33.429
Blue 20. Set! Hut!

01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:36.399
<i>Crewe feigns the pass...</i>

01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:40.072
<i>...and he throws...</i>

01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:43.909
...stopping the clock again
with 16 seconds left.

01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:49.229
Flip right, dive left, Indian.

01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:52.000
Now, if we don't make it,
everybody yell time.

01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:54.031
Everybody yell time.
On one. Ready?

01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:03.719
Blue 29! Blue 29!
Set!

01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:07.154
<i>Ball goes back to Crewe...</i>

01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:13.396
Time! Time!

01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:16.479
Crewe calls for his third
and last time out

01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:18.955
<i>with seven seconds left on the clock.</i>

01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:21.670
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:25.432
Where the hell's he going?

01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:27.959
Let's find out.

01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:33.197
<i>Crewe has taken his last time out
and he's heading toward the bench.</i>

01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:38.315
<i>He's heading toward the bench
followed by his entire offensive unit.</i>

01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:40.759
<i>Most unusual...</i>

01:48:41.800 --> 01:48:45.156
<i>I don't know what they're doing,
it's silent as a church.</i>

01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:49.789
<i>It looks more like a prayer meeting
than a huddle.</i>

01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:52.230
<i>Whatever happens,
regardless of the outcome,</i>

01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:55.477
<i>this has been one fantastic showing.</i>

01:48:55.680 --> 01:48:58.399
We've come too far together
to stop now.

01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:01.797
For Granny, for Nate,

01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:08.274
for Caretaker, let's do it.

01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:18.389
Mean Machine!

01:49:21.240 --> 01:49:22.832
Mean Machine!

01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:28.513
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:43.318
- Hold it down!
- Cool it!

01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:47.154
Set!

01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:50.431
Hut!

01:51:17.160 --> 01:51:21.551
<i>Thirty-six, thirty-five,
in favour of the Mean Machine.</i>

01:51:29.800 --> 01:51:31.074
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:33.350
<i>like the fabled phoenix of old...</i>

01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:47.229
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:50.830
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

01:51:51.040 --> 01:51:54.555
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:56.751
Mean Machine! Mean Machine!

01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:26.029
- You know, you guys ain't half bad.
- You're right.

01:52:27.680 --> 01:52:29.113
Fuck you, boy.

01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:32.114
Not today, boss.

01:52:40.040 --> 01:52:42.713
History.

01:52:42.920 --> 01:52:46.993
We stopped 'em. We are number one!

01:52:55.960 --> 01:52:59.111
Where's your goddamn
power theory now?

01:52:59.320 --> 01:53:01.231
He's trying to escape.

01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:04.079
- Oh, shit!
- Officer!

01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:06.191
- Crewe!
- I'm talking to you!

01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:10.074
Crewe!

01:53:10.280 --> 01:53:12.589
He's trying to escape. Shoot him!

01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:16.158
- Crewe!
- You going to let him escape? Shoot.

01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:19.033
- Shoot him, you... Shoot him!
- Crewe!

01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:24.473
- Crewe!
- Kill him! Kill that son of a bitch!

01:53:24.680 --> 01:53:26.272
Shoot him!

01:53:45.640 --> 01:53:47.870
Game ball.

01:54:02.200 --> 01:54:04.475
Stick this in your trophy case.

01:54:10.680 --> 01:54:13.194
I knew you could do it!
