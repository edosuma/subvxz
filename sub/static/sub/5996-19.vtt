WEBVTT

00:01.468 --> 00:03.570
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 All right, let's recap
 this bad boy.

00:03.604 --> 00:05.406
Jane and her family were
 living at the Marbella

00:05.439 --> 00:07.775
because their house
 flooded, but

00:07.808 --> 00:11.145
she and Michael had signed the
 lease for a house of their own,

00:11.179 --> 00:14.115
and they planned to move in
 after they got married.

00:14.148 --> 00:15.283
Meanwhile, Rafael

00:15.316 --> 00:17.251
had requested more time
 with his son.

00:17.285 --> 00:20.121
I want to be the man
most present in Mateo's life.

00:20.154 --> 00:22.123
And speaking of family bonds,

00:22.156 --> 00:24.458
Rafael's brother, Derek,
 was back in town,

00:24.492 --> 00:26.594
and at first,
 Rafael didn't trust him.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.162
Did you know our mother
was a crime lord?

00:28.196 --> 00:29.563
There's got to be something
on his boat.

00:29.597 --> 00:30.431
Good, so search his boat.

00:30.464 --> 00:31.599
But it turned out

00:31.632 --> 00:32.833
Derek was telling

00:32.866 --> 00:34.668
the truth, and, oh, yeah,

00:34.702 --> 00:36.404
Petra's long lost twin
 showed up.

00:36.437 --> 00:37.571
My long lost sister.

00:37.605 --> 00:39.073
And, well, she was slightly

00:39.107 --> 00:40.308
less polished than Petra.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.543
Did you steal a wallet?
No.

00:42.576 --> 00:43.811
I stole three wallets.

00:43.844 --> 00:45.679
And she was also
 kind of crushing

00:45.713 --> 00:47.315
on Rafael.
Leaping lizards!

00:47.348 --> 00:48.682
I know, straight out of

00:48.716 --> 00:50.551
a telenovela, right?
 Well, imagine this.

00:50.584 --> 00:52.620
Jane's father had
 just broken up

00:52.653 --> 00:54.455
with her mother,
 Xiomara,

00:54.488 --> 00:56.090
and now he was hooking up

00:56.124 --> 00:57.158
with the head writer
 on his show.

00:57.191 --> 00:58.692
And speaking of plot twists,

00:58.726 --> 01:01.195
remember our crime lord,
 Sin Rostro?

01:01.229 --> 01:02.230
Well, she was killed

01:02.263 --> 01:04.098
by the crime lord, Mutter.

01:04.132 --> 01:05.465
I know, I know, a lot of

01:05.498 --> 01:06.800
crime lords to keep track of.

01:06.834 --> 01:09.170
Anyway, one's dead,
 one's on the run,

01:09.203 --> 01:10.538
and Detective Michael
 is on the case.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.273
At least I hope he is.

01:12.306 --> 01:14.675
Anyway, let's dive in.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.544
Like many girls
 at the age of seven,

01:16.577 --> 01:18.279
Jane Gloriana Villanueva

01:18.312 --> 01:20.681
saved her money
 in a piggy bank.

01:20.714 --> 01:23.684
However, unlike many girls
 at the age of seven,

01:23.717 --> 01:26.554
Jane Gloriana Villanueva
 never spent said money.

01:26.587 --> 01:27.621
Jane...

01:27.655 --> 01:29.290
it's not gonna
fit any more.

01:29.323 --> 01:30.424
And the whole point

01:30.458 --> 01:31.592
of saving money is so one day

01:31.625 --> 01:33.261
you can buy something.
No...

01:33.294 --> 01:34.528
the whole point of saving

01:34.562 --> 01:35.596
is so that you have money

01:35.629 --> 01:37.231
in case of an emergency.

01:37.265 --> 01:38.532
Not when you're seven.

01:38.566 --> 01:40.268
You don't have to worry
about money, okay.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.336
Please, just buy anything.

01:43.604 --> 01:46.540
Fine, another piggy bank.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.376
Yes, from a very early age

01:48.409 --> 01:50.244
Jane had her
 priorities straight.

01:50.278 --> 01:53.647
And to this day,
 they haven't changed.

01:53.681 --> 01:55.816
Ooh, okay, these are
reasonably priced.

01:55.849 --> 01:57.251
Which one do you think:

01:57.285 --> 02:00.888
the cute giraffe
or the classic stripe?

02:02.790 --> 02:05.226
Oh, it's got to
be the giraffe, right?
Oh.

02:05.259 --> 02:07.528
I feel like that could
be Mateo's spirit animal.

02:07.561 --> 02:09.363
Big eyes, gentle.

02:09.396 --> 02:12.600
Totally, plus it can spark
a lifelong interest in zoology,

02:12.633 --> 02:13.901
or African studies.

02:13.934 --> 02:16.670
That's a lot to put
on a rug, but sure.

02:16.704 --> 02:17.771
All right.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.373
It's going in the cart.

02:21.275 --> 02:23.411
Oh, that's a little more

02:23.444 --> 02:26.347
than I was planning
on spending.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.282
You know what, I'm just
gonna put it back.

02:28.316 --> 02:29.383
No, don't.

02:29.417 --> 02:31.385
Come on, we have
two incomes now,

02:31.419 --> 02:33.221
and it's our first
home together...

02:33.254 --> 02:34.888
it should be special.

02:34.922 --> 02:37.691
Plus, what about Mateo's
zoology career, huh?

02:37.725 --> 02:40.828
Yeah, okay.

02:40.861 --> 02:43.564
I'll just leave it in my cart
overnight and think about it.

02:43.597 --> 02:44.865
Of course, you will.

02:46.267 --> 02:47.968
Aw, isn't this nice?

02:48.001 --> 02:49.403
Things are so good.

02:49.437 --> 02:50.404
(doorbell rings)

02:50.438 --> 02:51.705
Alas...

02:51.739 --> 02:53.407
knowing telenovela structures
 as I do,

02:53.441 --> 02:54.908
I'm a little worried.

02:54.942 --> 02:56.377
Room service.

02:56.410 --> 02:57.911
My two favorite words.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.380
Uh, right here is good.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.982
Coffee's hot
and here's your paper.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.252
Thank you very much.

03:11.392 --> 03:12.993
Oh, my God.
What is it?

03:13.026 --> 03:14.995
Yeah... I don't mean

03:15.028 --> 03:17.331
to sound smug,
 but I did see

03:17.365 --> 03:19.233
this coming.

03:27.908 --> 03:29.910
"Detective Cordero had
a conflict of interest

03:29.943 --> 03:31.579
right from the start"?

03:31.612 --> 03:33.414
Are they talking about me?
I-it must be.

03:33.447 --> 03:34.748
"His connection
to the Solano family

03:34.782 --> 03:37.451
compromised the entire
investigation,"

03:37.485 --> 03:39.387
said one source.
That's ridiculous.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.654
Your relationship with Rafael

03:40.688 --> 03:42.356
is what helped you
set up the sting.

03:42.390 --> 03:43.724
That's not how they see it.
They said that I got

03:43.757 --> 03:45.393
Sin Rostro killed,
let Mutter get away,

03:45.426 --> 03:47.528
and I'm quoting,
"Left a giant mess behind

03:47.561 --> 03:49.397
with no leads and no arrests."

03:49.430 --> 03:51.265
I don't understand.
Where is all this coming from?

03:51.299 --> 03:52.333
A mole in the police department.

03:52.366 --> 03:53.567
It has to be.
But why?

03:53.601 --> 03:54.668
I don't know.
I got to get down there.

03:55.703 --> 03:57.271
Oh...

03:57.305 --> 03:59.473
This is going
to blow over.
Mm-hmm.

03:59.507 --> 04:01.942
Remember, today's news
is tomorrow's trash.

04:01.975 --> 04:03.010
Yeah, I know, you're right.

04:03.043 --> 04:04.011
Okay.

04:04.044 --> 04:06.514
You're right.

04:12.453 --> 04:17.291
Yeah, unfortunately, they still
 have to get through today.

04:17.325 --> 04:19.327
How the hell did they know
about my boat?

04:19.360 --> 04:20.560
What are you talking about?

04:20.594 --> 04:22.262
It's in the article, man.

04:27.801 --> 04:29.670
Uh-oh.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.840
You were the only one who knew.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.375
I didn't tell anyone.

04:34.408 --> 04:35.909
Technically, untrue,
 by the way.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.779
Actually, completely untrue.

04:38.812 --> 04:41.615
PETRA:
 Are they ever going
 to let this die?

04:41.649 --> 04:43.717
They mentioned the Marbella
four times.

04:43.751 --> 04:45.319
I mean,

04:45.353 --> 04:47.020
you have a few murders
in your hotel and...
Hey,

04:47.054 --> 04:50.023
uh... you want to, maybe,
change a diaper?

04:50.057 --> 04:51.925
No, no thanks, I changed one
a few days ago.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.461
But I'll hold
the other one

04:53.494 --> 04:55.763
while you do it.
Great, thanks.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.667
Yeah, no problem.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.435
Honestly, I feel so much better.

05:01.469 --> 05:02.803
Those pills...

05:02.836 --> 05:04.672
Ah, yes,
 thanks to modern medicine

05:04.705 --> 05:07.408
Petra's great depression
 has lifted.

05:07.441 --> 05:08.942
Well, I am glad
they're working.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.411
Me, too.
(chuckles)

05:10.444 --> 05:12.446
I mean, now I-I

05:12.480 --> 05:15.749
can accept that I'm just not
one of those maternal moms,

05:15.783 --> 05:17.017
and I'm fine with that.

05:17.050 --> 05:19.553
They're cute in small doses.

05:19.587 --> 05:21.088
Aren't you, Anna?

05:21.121 --> 05:22.856
Elsa.

05:23.891 --> 05:26.126
Oh.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.362
Anyway, let's talk
about their trust funds.

05:28.396 --> 05:30.964
Yup, Petra is definitely
 back to her old self.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.900
I have a copy of the
estate plan in my bag.

05:32.933 --> 05:35.869
Mm. And is it
the same as Mateo's?

05:38.071 --> 05:39.440
Of course.

05:39.473 --> 05:40.608
I mean, they're siblings.

05:40.641 --> 05:42.042
ANEZKA:
Hello to you.

05:42.075 --> 05:44.011
And speaking of siblings...

05:44.044 --> 05:45.846
Hi, Anezka.
Good morning.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.381
Oh, right.

05:47.415 --> 05:48.849
Somebody's crushing hard,

05:48.882 --> 05:50.050
but, come on,

05:50.083 --> 05:51.919
is anybody shipping these two?

05:55.823 --> 05:57.057
Off to work?

05:59.560 --> 06:00.994
Yes.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.730
Oh, I just loving dress.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.932
I feel like... real princess.

06:04.965 --> 06:06.133
Mm, 'kay,

06:06.166 --> 06:07.768
relax, it's just
a waitress uniform.

06:07.801 --> 06:08.769
Petra...

06:08.802 --> 06:10.137
be nice.

06:11.171 --> 06:13.641
(moans softly)

06:16.844 --> 06:18.879
How is the waitressing going?

06:18.912 --> 06:21.615
Scott says she's
doing a great job.

06:21.649 --> 06:22.950
You are wasting this?

06:22.983 --> 06:24.885
Where I am coming from,

06:24.918 --> 06:26.520
people are killing for this.

06:26.554 --> 06:28.789
Yeah, she's not
 doing a great job.

06:28.822 --> 06:31.992
No problem, we do
serve large portions.

06:32.025 --> 06:33.427
Thank you.

06:33.461 --> 06:36.063
But she is the boss's sister.

06:36.096 --> 06:38.532
Seriously, I have
never been more bitter

06:38.566 --> 06:40.901
about pooling tips.
I know,
she's a disaster.

06:40.934 --> 06:42.570
Thank you for
covering my tables.

06:42.603 --> 06:45.473
I just cleared newspapers
from the lobby,

06:45.506 --> 06:46.607
hospitality, the gym...

06:46.640 --> 06:47.741
What are you two doing?

06:47.775 --> 06:49.409
Stay on top of your tables.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.847
Settle down, Vests,
just 'cause you can't fire her

06:53.881 --> 06:55.182
doesn't mean you have
to take it out on us.

06:55.215 --> 06:57.084
He can't exactly fire Jane,

06:57.117 --> 06:58.819
either.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.554
Damn, Daniel.

07:00.588 --> 07:01.822
Back at it again with the vests.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.692
(laughs)

07:04.725 --> 07:05.893
(groans)

07:05.926 --> 07:07.928
I'm just frustrated.

07:07.961 --> 07:10.097
Work has been miserable lately.
Plus, you're on

07:10.130 --> 07:11.832
day three without
your kid, right?

07:11.865 --> 07:13.801
But you get him
back tomorrow?

07:13.834 --> 07:15.068
Ah, the heart of it.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.570
Yeah.

07:16.604 --> 07:17.905
Trust me, I get it.

07:17.938 --> 07:19.573
Shared custody's hard.

07:19.607 --> 07:20.808
(sighs)

07:20.841 --> 07:22.209
It sure is...

07:22.242 --> 07:25.045
which is why
 when this happened,

07:25.078 --> 07:27.214
it felt like
 a stroke of good luck.

07:27.247 --> 07:29.082
(laughs)
Hey!

07:29.116 --> 07:31.952
I thought Rafael
was taking him to the zoo.

07:31.985 --> 07:35.789
Um, Mr. Solano had to work last
minute so we're going for

07:35.823 --> 07:37.057
a walk, and then
I'm gonna make him

07:37.090 --> 07:38.559
dinner and put him down.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.260
Oh, well, I'm done with
my shift. I'll take him.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.261
Are you sure?

07:41.294 --> 07:42.963
Of course!

07:42.996 --> 07:45.232
I've been craving some extra
time with Mr. Sweetface.

07:45.265 --> 07:47.668
Hi, you, baby.
(smooching)

07:47.701 --> 07:48.836
Oh, I'm just annoyed because

07:48.869 --> 07:49.970
we said that we'd
call each other

07:50.003 --> 07:51.104
before we called a sitter.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.205
(growls faintly)

07:52.239 --> 07:53.707
Yeah, wait, what
are you doing?

07:53.741 --> 07:55.843
Uh, do you think I could
be a silent movie star?

07:55.876 --> 07:57.244
(laughs)
You?

07:57.277 --> 07:58.746
Silent?

07:58.779 --> 08:01.081
Ha, ha, in Rogelio's show
there's this part,

08:01.114 --> 08:04.585
a 1920s lounge singer
with an amazing voice

08:04.618 --> 08:05.953
who's a silent
movie star,

08:05.986 --> 08:08.055
but no one can
ever hear her.

08:08.088 --> 08:10.123
Oh, that's like
Little Mermaid tragic.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.124
But then she gets
to sing a song

08:11.158 --> 08:12.125
at the end of the episode.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.895
Oh, my God, stop.

08:14.928 --> 08:15.896
Right?

08:15.929 --> 08:17.230
So what do you think?

08:17.264 --> 08:18.666
Should I ask your dad
if I can audition?

08:19.900 --> 08:21.635
(laughing):
I don't know if

08:21.669 --> 08:23.604
that's a yes or a no.

08:23.637 --> 08:24.738
It means...

08:24.772 --> 08:26.006
go for it.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.040
I mean, you and Dad are

08:27.074 --> 08:28.108
in a much better place, right?

08:28.141 --> 08:30.043
Plus, Dad's been
in a really

08:30.077 --> 08:31.178
good mood lately.

08:31.211 --> 08:32.679
True, for the record.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.586
Rogelio was in
 a really good mood,

08:38.619 --> 08:40.587
and here's why.

08:40.621 --> 08:43.924
Yeah, okay, that music
is approved, mm-hmm.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.726
Move on.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.961
It is very sexy
when you approve things.

08:47.995 --> 08:50.898
I got to go, and this
isn't happening again.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.300
Yes, this is what you said
the last 12 times.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.102
Whatever.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.704
I'm late for casting.

08:56.737 --> 08:58.071
We still don't have
an Eleanor Roosevelt.

08:58.105 --> 08:59.707
Good luck, and remember,

08:59.740 --> 09:02.910
we want to capture
Eleanor's inner beauty

09:02.943 --> 09:04.778
but on the outside.

09:04.812 --> 09:06.113
See you later.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.048
Again, this isn't
happening again.

09:08.081 --> 09:12.953
Again, that's what she said
 the last 12 times.

09:14.021 --> 09:15.155
What do you think, Mateo?

09:15.188 --> 09:16.323
Do we need the rug?

09:16.356 --> 09:19.159
It really ties
the room together.

09:21.061 --> 09:22.029
(coos)

09:22.062 --> 09:24.598
Is that a yes or a no, hmm?

09:24.632 --> 09:25.666
Hmm?
(doorbell rings)

09:25.699 --> 09:27.334
Oh, who is there?

09:31.104 --> 09:32.339
I'm sorry to bother you.

09:32.372 --> 09:34.307
Just here to get my son.

09:34.341 --> 09:35.809
What's wrong?

09:35.843 --> 09:37.310
It's my day to have Mateo.

09:37.344 --> 09:38.311
I know...

09:38.345 --> 09:39.947
but I saw him with Chepa

09:39.980 --> 09:41.649
and we agreed
that if something came up,

09:41.682 --> 09:43.183
we'd call each other.
Why didn't you call me?

09:43.216 --> 09:44.818
Because it was my day, and,

09:44.852 --> 09:46.219
frankly, I just really
didn't want the judgment.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.021
There's no judgment.
I mean, if you're

09:48.055 --> 09:49.923
feeling guilty
I'm not feeling guilty.

09:49.957 --> 09:50.958
because you requested more time
and you're not with him...

09:50.991 --> 09:53.360
There it is,
that's the judgment.
Stating a fact

09:53.393 --> 09:55.595
is not judgment.
I just don't need to feel
constantly guilted, okay?

09:57.230 --> 09:59.933
I want to say something
without you getting mad.

09:59.967 --> 10:02.169
Well, the implication that
you can't express your opinion

10:02.202 --> 10:04.838
without me getting mad
is making me mad.
I-I just...

10:04.872 --> 10:06.707
don't want to start this whole
thing and have you spin out.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.709
Is this you trying
to not make me mad?

10:08.742 --> 10:09.910
I think some sort
of custody arrangement

10:09.943 --> 10:11.111
might be good for us.

10:11.144 --> 10:13.914
With lawyers?

10:13.947 --> 10:16.249
Because they make
things contentious.
That's why

10:16.283 --> 10:18.318
I was thinking that
we use a mediator.

10:18.351 --> 10:19.953
You know,
keep things friendly,

10:19.987 --> 10:21.722
so everything is established.

10:21.755 --> 10:23.256
You know, all the rules.

10:24.992 --> 10:27.695
Things are getting more
complicated the older he gets.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.362
Exactly.

10:29.396 --> 10:31.131
It would just be nice to have
everything on paper 'cause

10:31.164 --> 10:35.068
I don't feel that this
gray area is helping us or him.

10:35.102 --> 10:37.938
Yeah.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.239
Okay, let's do it.

10:39.272 --> 10:40.273
Great.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.275
I'll set it up.
Thank you.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.343
Thank you.

10:43.376 --> 10:44.978
It's a good idea.

10:45.012 --> 10:46.947
Geez, even the suggestion
 of mediation

10:46.980 --> 10:48.148
is making things better.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.683
So, I'll drop him off tomorrow?

10:49.717 --> 10:50.684
Mm-hmm, good-bye,

10:50.718 --> 10:52.820
Mr. Sweetface, I love you.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.087
Want to come to Daddy?
MATEO: Mom-mom.

10:54.121 --> 10:55.889
Oh, come here, buddy.
Oh.

10:55.923 --> 10:58.225
Hey, you can let go.
(Mateo cries)

10:58.258 --> 11:00.093
Okay.
All right.
(grunts)

11:00.127 --> 11:01.895
Hey, little man,
it's okay.

11:01.929 --> 11:03.063
(Mateo crying)

11:03.096 --> 11:04.197
Separation anxiety kicks
in at this age.

11:04.231 --> 11:05.899
Bye.

11:05.933 --> 11:09.069
(Mateo crying)

11:10.738 --> 11:13.440
Yup, it's separation anxiety,
 all right.

11:13.473 --> 11:15.776
(sighs)

11:15.809 --> 11:17.945
Come on,
 you deserve it, Jane.

11:17.978 --> 11:20.380
Let's do this!

11:20.413 --> 11:22.783
(squeals)
Okay, I did it.

11:22.816 --> 11:24.918
Hi, sorry, I just bought
the stuff for Mateo's bedroom.

11:24.952 --> 11:27.220
Let the zoology passion begin.

11:29.222 --> 11:30.190
Are you okay?

11:30.223 --> 11:32.459
I got fired.

11:32.492 --> 11:36.063
Oh, dear, I'm... speechless.

11:36.096 --> 11:38.298
(dramatic piano music plays)

11:53.180 --> 11:54.882
How can they
do this to you?

11:54.915 --> 11:56.349
I mean, you're the reason
why Sin Rostro isn't still

11:56.383 --> 11:57.751
out there
terrorizing people.

11:57.785 --> 11:59.219
That's not how the
department sees it.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.388
The article embarrassed them,
they needed a fall guy.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.390
Oh, Michael.
Technically,
I'm on six months

12:03.423 --> 12:05.092
unpaid leave pending
further investigation

12:05.125 --> 12:06.393
but it feels like a formality.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.962
I can't believe
they're doing this to you.

12:08.996 --> 12:11.398
(sighs)

12:11.431 --> 12:14.201
I can't believe
I'm unemployed.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.036
We just signed
a new lease.

12:16.069 --> 12:20.173
Yeah, well, maybe we'll
just back out of it.

12:20.207 --> 12:21.341
No.

12:21.374 --> 12:22.943
No way, you love that house.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.044
I love that house.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.979
It's a miracle
we even got it.

12:26.013 --> 12:28.181
I'll just... I'll-I'll
find another job.

12:28.215 --> 12:30.150
I'll start making
calls tomorrow.
Yeah.

12:30.183 --> 12:31.184
Okay.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.552
In the meantime, I'll pick up

12:32.585 --> 12:33.787
some extra shifts at work.

12:33.821 --> 12:34.922
I thought you were hating it.

12:34.955 --> 12:36.456
No, it's actually been...

12:36.489 --> 12:38.058
kind of fun lately.

12:38.091 --> 12:42.429
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Yeah, not technically true,
 or, like, true at all.

12:42.462 --> 12:44.064
I'll talk to Scott.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.165
More shifts?

12:46.867 --> 12:48.235
Absolutely.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.137
Oh, really?
Thank you, Scott.

12:50.170 --> 12:51.204
In fact,

12:51.238 --> 12:52.906
I have the perfect job for you.

12:53.941 --> 12:57.277
You can train Anezka.

12:57.310 --> 12:58.478
I asked you to
hold the onions

12:58.511 --> 13:00.380
but there are
onions on here.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.049
You're right.

13:02.082 --> 13:04.284
So sorry.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.086
Oh, oh.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.057
Oh...

13:14.361 --> 13:16.196
You know, I-I do teach
all day long.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.430
You'll be great.

13:17.464 --> 13:19.032
Okay, yes.

13:19.066 --> 13:21.134
Yes.

13:21.168 --> 13:24.537
I could do this. Hmm.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.039
Hi.
(screams)

13:26.073 --> 13:27.240
(glasses break)

13:32.245 --> 13:33.346
Cut!

13:46.459 --> 13:48.228
Xiomara, hi!
Hi!

13:48.261 --> 13:49.229
What a pleasant
surprise.

13:49.262 --> 13:50.563
Come!

13:50.597 --> 13:52.365
Join me for a shoe shine.

13:54.201 --> 13:56.103
So, what brings you
to the set

13:56.136 --> 13:58.972
of the world's
favorite telenovela?

13:59.006 --> 14:03.110
Well, I...
I have a favor to ask,

14:03.143 --> 14:04.644
and you can
totally say no.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.379
Go on.

14:06.413 --> 14:08.916
Is there any way that
I can audition for the part

14:08.949 --> 14:11.084
of the silent movie
star lounge singer?

14:11.118 --> 14:13.286
I wouldn't expect any
preferential treatment.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.487
Don't be ridiculous,

14:14.521 --> 14:17.357
I'm a huge proponent
of nepotism.

14:17.390 --> 14:18.358
There's no need
to audition.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.193
The part is yours.
Really?!

14:20.227 --> 14:21.528
Of course!

14:21.561 --> 14:22.896
Rogelio, they're
ready for you.
Terrific.

14:22.930 --> 14:24.197
Now, I must go
and make love

14:24.231 --> 14:26.533
to the gorgeous
Eleanor Roosevelt.

14:26.566 --> 14:28.668
#AnActorsLife.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.137
Boom!

14:30.170 --> 14:31.371
(chuckles)

14:34.474 --> 14:36.209
(talking low, indistinctly)

14:36.243 --> 14:38.111
(sniffs)
(talks indistinctly)

14:39.980 --> 14:41.014
(sneezes)

14:41.048 --> 14:42.349
There you go.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.583
Yummy!

14:43.616 --> 14:44.952
I'm not eating that!
Of course not.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.253
We'll make you another one.

14:46.286 --> 14:48.989
Sorry about that--
she's just training.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.457
Okay, sneezes are
another thing.

14:50.490 --> 14:53.660
If you have to sneeze,
sneeze away from the food.

14:53.693 --> 14:56.329
Also, maybe try to smile.

14:56.363 --> 14:57.497
Why would I smile?

14:57.530 --> 14:58.531
I working.

14:58.565 --> 14:59.967
Right, you want people

15:00.000 --> 15:01.634
to feel welcome.
They're your guests.

15:01.668 --> 15:03.503
Okay, I make smile.

15:03.536 --> 15:05.038
Okay.

15:06.974 --> 15:09.943
Well, maybe try
a little more relaxed.

15:09.977 --> 15:12.145
Oops, no,
it was better before.

15:12.179 --> 15:14.147
A-and be conscious
of your body language.

15:14.181 --> 15:15.682
The best servers are invisible,

15:15.715 --> 15:17.650
floating from one table
to the next,

15:17.684 --> 15:20.387
and remember, the customer
is always right.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.389
No one is always right...

15:22.422 --> 15:23.957
except Czar.

15:23.991 --> 15:26.093
Okay...

15:26.126 --> 15:28.261
let's pretend every
customer is the Czar.

15:28.295 --> 15:31.264
Now take this to the kitchen
and ask them for a new one.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.000
(phone whooshes)

15:33.033 --> 15:34.701
Oh, God.

15:37.537 --> 15:41.141
Oh, Alba, I know you meant
 that as a nice gesture but...

15:41.174 --> 15:43.076
WOMAN:
Excuse me?

15:43.110 --> 15:44.477
Could we get more iced tea?

15:44.511 --> 15:46.279
Mm-hmm.
I told you Evan's

15:46.313 --> 15:47.981
on the wait list?
You did.

15:48.015 --> 15:50.117
So, I offered this guy $1,200

15:50.150 --> 15:51.985
to help him write
his supplemental essay,

15:52.019 --> 15:53.286
to just push him
over the top,

15:53.320 --> 15:55.388
and suddenly
it's not enough.

15:55.422 --> 15:58.125
And maybe it was because
 she missed Mateo so much,

15:58.158 --> 16:00.093
or because she was
 stressed out about money,

16:00.127 --> 16:01.528
or because she was responsible
 for training a woman

16:01.561 --> 16:03.163
who was currently
 pulling ice cubes

16:03.196 --> 16:04.164
out of a customer's glass

16:04.197 --> 16:05.332
with her fingers.

16:05.365 --> 16:06.466
Excuse me.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.202
(ragtime music plays)

16:30.090 --> 16:32.492
And then I pitched myself
as a grad student and a T.A.

16:32.525 --> 16:35.728
and I said I'd do it for a
thousand, and she said yes!

16:35.762 --> 16:36.763
Seriously?!

16:36.796 --> 16:38.198
I know!

16:38.231 --> 16:39.599
Who knew there was
this crazy business?

16:39.632 --> 16:40.767
Helping people with
their college essays?

16:40.800 --> 16:42.135
Are you kidding me?!

16:42.169 --> 16:43.503
That's like a fun Saturday.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.338
Only for you, Jane.
 Only for you.

16:45.372 --> 16:48.808
And best of all, I get to
do it at home with Mateo.

16:48.841 --> 16:50.343
I can't believe it.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.779
And you got the part in Tiago.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.647
Things are looking swell,
I tell ya.

16:55.648 --> 16:56.616
I was doing, like,

16:56.649 --> 16:57.617
a '20s thing, there.

16:57.650 --> 17:00.353
Oh... ha.

17:00.387 --> 17:03.123
What's going on?

17:03.156 --> 17:06.159
Your father's sleeping
with Dina.

17:06.193 --> 17:07.194
Writer Dina?

17:07.227 --> 17:08.694
What? No.

17:08.728 --> 17:09.796
How do you know?

17:09.829 --> 17:11.531
He did the sex sniff.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.532
Okay, I don't know what
you're talking about

17:13.566 --> 17:14.834
and I don't want to.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.636
Too late, I do.

17:16.669 --> 17:18.671
(sniffs)

17:21.574 --> 17:24.577
(sniffs)

17:26.546 --> 17:29.249
(sniffs)

17:29.282 --> 17:31.551
Sorry, not in the mood.

17:33.820 --> 17:36.389
Seriously, I didn't
need to know that.

17:36.423 --> 17:39.359
I just... I didn't think
he'd move on so quickly.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.094
I know, Mom.

17:41.128 --> 17:43.130
Is it gonna be too hard
to work with him?
No...

17:43.163 --> 17:44.297
No.

17:44.331 --> 17:45.465
I'm just absorbing.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.267
I'll be fine.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.269
Exes work together all the time.

17:49.302 --> 17:51.771
Which brings us here, now.

17:59.546 --> 18:01.848
Okay, so let's start.

18:01.881 --> 18:03.416
Can I get a little history?

18:03.450 --> 18:04.817
Oh.

18:04.851 --> 18:05.852
(both chuckle)

18:05.885 --> 18:08.421
Um, well, it started, uh...

18:08.455 --> 18:11.658
Actually, sorry, I can't
 hear this for the 99th time.

18:11.691 --> 18:14.461
(ragtime music plays)

18:32.479 --> 18:34.447
(dramatic piano music plays)

18:39.486 --> 18:41.488
(cheerful piano music plays)

18:57.904 --> 18:59.606
We're planning on being
true co-parents.

18:59.639 --> 19:00.607
That's right.

19:00.640 --> 19:01.774
That's great.

19:01.808 --> 19:02.909
We should hammer out

19:02.942 --> 19:04.244
the hypothetical details,

19:04.277 --> 19:05.345
just in case.

19:05.378 --> 19:07.380
Of course.
Okay.
Okay, then.

19:07.414 --> 19:09.316
Let's dive into
the nitty-gritty.

19:09.349 --> 19:10.950
Hypothetical nitty-gritty.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.752
Great.
 Great!

19:14.687 --> 19:17.390
I assure you,
Xiomara is a brilliant actress.

19:17.424 --> 19:18.758
We ran lines together

19:18.791 --> 19:20.293
all the time.
Has she acted

19:20.327 --> 19:21.294
in Spanish before?

19:21.328 --> 19:22.362
No.

19:22.395 --> 19:23.596
Has she acted on camera before?

19:23.630 --> 19:24.664
No.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.433
(laughs)

19:26.466 --> 19:28.401
What?
I see what's
happening here.

19:28.435 --> 19:31.904
Someone's a little jelly.

19:31.938 --> 19:33.240
Jelly?

19:33.273 --> 19:34.241
You know,

19:34.274 --> 19:35.275
the green-eyed monster?

19:35.308 --> 19:36.343
What?!

19:36.376 --> 19:38.311
I'm not jealous.
I'm pissed.

19:38.345 --> 19:39.779
(record scratches)
This bar should be on
the other side of set.

19:39.812 --> 19:41.381
We discussed this.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.550
You are not allowed
to hire anyone

19:43.583 --> 19:44.784
without consulting me first.

19:44.817 --> 19:47.487
So your ex-girlfriend
better be great.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.888
EILEEN:
 Great...

19:48.921 --> 19:50.690
so...

19:50.723 --> 19:53.326
you'll each have him every other
Christmas until he's 18,

19:53.360 --> 19:54.661
and then Mateo can choose.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.429
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Can I just say,

19:56.463 --> 19:58.298
these two don't seem
 nearly as relaxed

19:58.331 --> 19:59.666
as they did when we left.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.534
Right, but...
I know,

20:01.568 --> 20:02.969
I know, it's just hypothetical,

20:03.002 --> 20:04.271
you're going to do
them together.

20:04.304 --> 20:06.239
Got it. Okay,

20:06.273 --> 20:07.740
on to summer vacations?

20:07.774 --> 20:08.741
Okay.
Okay.

20:08.775 --> 20:09.776
How many days

20:09.809 --> 20:11.444
will you each allow the other

20:11.478 --> 20:12.579
to take Mateo on vacation?

20:12.612 --> 20:14.747
A week.
A month.

20:14.781 --> 20:16.383
A month?
A week?

20:16.416 --> 20:18.951
Uh-oh, those are not
 the same things.

20:18.985 --> 20:20.620
What-what if I want
to take Mateo to Europe?

20:20.653 --> 20:21.921
For a month?!

20:21.954 --> 20:23.523
No way!

20:23.556 --> 20:25.292
I-I can't go that long
without seeing him.

20:25.325 --> 20:26.693
Anyway, wait,

20:26.726 --> 20:28.561
t-t-this is just all
hypothetical.

20:28.595 --> 20:29.996
No, actually, this
is not hypothetical.

20:30.029 --> 20:31.831
This is something that
I really want to do someday.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.266
Are you serious?
Yes!

20:33.300 --> 20:34.734
One of the only positive

20:34.767 --> 20:36.403
childhood memories I have
is the month I'd spend

20:36.436 --> 20:37.236
with my father travelling
in the summer.

20:37.270 --> 20:39.672
So then travel with him
for a week,

20:39.706 --> 20:40.907
ten days.
It's too short.

20:40.940 --> 20:43.676
I just can't agree to a month.
But this is important to me.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.011
Yeah, well, it's important
to me to see my son.

20:45.044 --> 20:45.712
Our son!

20:45.745 --> 20:47.814
How about we all take a breath

20:47.847 --> 20:50.049
and see if we can agree on...
Please,

20:50.082 --> 20:51.050
just stay out of this.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.652
No, I can't.

20:52.685 --> 20:53.653
You're actually paying me

20:53.686 --> 20:54.754
not to stay out of it.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.330
Look, you've only
had one meeting.

21:03.363 --> 21:04.797
You can't go in there
thinking you're gonna be

21:04.831 --> 21:06.833
the most agreeable couple ever
and it'll be easy.

21:06.866 --> 21:09.669
I never expected that.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.003
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 I beg to differ.

21:11.037 --> 21:12.339
Just keep in mind that you both

21:12.372 --> 21:13.340
want what's best for Mateo.

21:13.373 --> 21:14.474
That's the priority.

21:14.507 --> 21:15.742
You're right.

21:15.775 --> 21:16.743
Thanks.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.711
Good luck with your interview!

21:18.745 --> 21:22.915
Oh, it's okay.

21:24.451 --> 21:25.818
(Mateo crying)

21:25.852 --> 21:28.455
Remember, Jane,

21:28.488 --> 21:31.023
separation anxiety
 is totally normal.

21:31.057 --> 21:32.359
Yeah, I know.

21:32.392 --> 21:34.093
Bye-bye, baby, bye.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.329
(Mateo continues crying)

21:37.664 --> 21:40.767
And from her baby...

21:40.800 --> 21:43.970
Nice clear voice and smile.

21:44.003 --> 21:45.772
...to her babysitting job.

21:45.805 --> 21:48.508
Is there anything else
I be getting for you?

21:48.541 --> 21:50.343
No, that'll be all.
Thank you, Anezka.

21:55.515 --> 21:56.916
Scott said she was doing great.

21:56.949 --> 21:59.018
She's gonna be great,
if it kills me.

21:59.051 --> 22:00.453
How are the girls?

22:00.487 --> 22:02.121
Oh, they're-they're good.

22:02.154 --> 22:05.057
Apparently, very well taken
care of if Rafael should die.

22:05.091 --> 22:06.459
Hmm?

22:06.493 --> 22:08.060
Oh, th-their trusts.

22:08.094 --> 22:10.397
You know, you went through
this process, didn't you?

22:10.430 --> 22:13.833
Of course, took forever.

22:13.866 --> 22:15.968
I know,
it's really overwhelming.

22:16.002 --> 22:17.670
It's a lot of money to manage.

22:17.704 --> 22:18.971
It certainly is.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.139
You're the one
managing it, right?

22:20.172 --> 22:21.674
Oh, yeah.
You?

22:21.708 --> 22:22.975
Who else?
(chuckles)

22:25.845 --> 22:27.480
Thank you, Anezka.

22:31.618 --> 22:32.819
That's not your order, is it?

22:32.852 --> 22:34.621
Not even close.
I'll fix it.

22:42.128 --> 22:43.696
Oh, dear.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.732
Looks like Rafael
 doesn't trust Petra

22:45.765 --> 22:47.500
with the... trust.

22:47.534 --> 22:48.668
ROGELIO:
 Trust me.

22:48.701 --> 22:50.002
You're going to be great.

22:50.036 --> 22:51.604
Just stay on your mark,

22:51.638 --> 22:52.939
and deliver your line

22:52.972 --> 22:53.873
just like we rehearsed.

22:53.906 --> 22:55.107
Got it, I'm ready.

22:55.141 --> 22:57.043
(whispering):
Yes.

22:57.076 --> 22:58.745
And... action!

23:27.106 --> 23:29.542
Enchanté.

23:33.646 --> 23:35.815
Men aren't really my deal.

23:35.848 --> 23:37.049
Cut!

23:37.083 --> 23:38.618
Oh, oh, my God,

23:38.651 --> 23:39.886
I said that in English.
I'm so sorry.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.454
No, it's fine,
don't worry, it's fine.

23:41.488 --> 23:42.822
First take, first take.

23:42.855 --> 23:44.156
Remember...

23:44.190 --> 23:45.892
And then I say...

23:47.727 --> 23:49.862
And then I get the idea
for the New Deal.

23:49.896 --> 23:51.564
Are you ready?
Got it, I'm ready.

23:52.632 --> 23:53.733
Let's go again.

23:53.766 --> 23:54.801
(Rogelio clears throat)
And...

23:54.834 --> 23:55.968
action!

23:57.870 --> 23:59.706
Enchanté.

24:05.244 --> 24:06.679
Cut!
God, I'm so sorry,

24:06.713 --> 24:07.747
I forgot, I-I was trying

24:07.780 --> 24:08.981
not to say it in English

24:09.015 --> 24:10.550
and I-and I-I
completely blanked.

24:10.583 --> 24:11.718
ROGELIO:
It's fine, it's fine.

24:11.751 --> 24:13.452
Let's go again.

24:15.788 --> 24:17.123
Cut!

24:17.156 --> 24:18.190
You're off your mark.

24:22.662 --> 24:23.630
Stop looking at the camera.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.004
Just...

24:32.038 --> 24:33.472
read it off my chest.

24:36.743 --> 24:39.812
I don't think acting
is really her deal.

24:41.614 --> 24:42.582
I'm so sorry.

24:42.615 --> 24:43.883
I know I was terrible.

24:43.916 --> 24:46.152
I-it's just
the cameras threw me,

24:46.185 --> 24:47.654
a-and the pressure.

24:47.687 --> 24:49.589
Don't worry.
This always happens.

24:49.622 --> 24:51.157
We'll fix it in post.

24:51.190 --> 24:52.992
Okay.

24:53.025 --> 24:54.026
Thank you.

24:55.061 --> 24:56.028
I'll see you tomorrow.

24:56.062 --> 24:57.129
Yes.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.865
She read off your chest.

24:58.898 --> 25:00.767
How are you gonna fix that
in post?

25:00.800 --> 25:02.902
I don't know, special effects.

25:02.935 --> 25:04.837
I mean, I saw
 Jurassic World.

25:04.871 --> 25:06.839
Are there really dinosaurs?

25:06.873 --> 25:08.575
No.

25:10.677 --> 25:12.979
How hard can it be
to raise her eye line

25:13.012 --> 25:14.246
just a couple of inches?

25:14.280 --> 25:16.215
JANE:
 All right, let's do this.

25:16.248 --> 25:18.618
Ready, Evan?

25:22.955 --> 25:24.557
Okay...

25:24.591 --> 25:26.926
so, to get off a college
wait list, you really want

25:26.959 --> 25:29.261
your supplemental materials
to communicate something

25:29.295 --> 25:31.230
that you didn't put
in your actual essay.

25:31.263 --> 25:33.766
What are your priorities,
your passions?

25:35.802 --> 25:39.005
I mean, I like helping
homeless people, and, like,

25:39.038 --> 25:43.576
poor people, and...
blind people.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.613
And that's your passion?

25:46.646 --> 25:49.716
No, honestly,
it doesn't matter to me.

25:49.749 --> 25:51.217
You can write whatever you want.

25:51.250 --> 25:52.785
Excuse me?

25:52.819 --> 25:54.153
Yeah, I'll just give you some

25:54.186 --> 25:55.588
notes whenever you're done.

25:58.958 --> 26:02.194
Mrs. Hutchinson,
I'm so sorry to bother you,

26:02.228 --> 26:04.330
but there's been
a little misunderstanding.

26:04.363 --> 26:08.067
Um, Evan seems to think
that I'm going

26:08.100 --> 26:09.702
to write the essay for him.

26:09.736 --> 26:12.104
Of course, you're going
to write the essay for him.

26:12.138 --> 26:15.007
Why else would I pay you
a thousand dollars?

26:16.242 --> 26:18.010
(quietly):
Oh.

26:22.381 --> 26:24.116
I can't believe
he's already asleep.

26:24.150 --> 26:25.217
He was happy and

26:25.251 --> 26:28.688
easy and adorable, if it helps.

26:28.721 --> 26:30.289
No, it doesn't.

26:31.758 --> 26:34.126
So... are you gonna
write the essay?

26:34.160 --> 26:35.862
No, definitely not.

26:35.895 --> 26:37.263
It's against
my school's honor code,

26:37.296 --> 26:39.098
and my own personal
code of ethics.

26:39.131 --> 26:40.667
I just meant,
it's a lot of money.

26:40.700 --> 26:41.934
(door opens)
Shh.

26:41.968 --> 26:43.870
Hi, hey.

26:43.903 --> 26:44.971
Hi.

26:47.139 --> 26:48.875
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Looks like somebody
 could use a drink...

26:48.908 --> 26:51.243
or... a nice, long talk.

26:51.277 --> 26:53.746
The interview
was just a courtesy.

26:53.780 --> 26:56.883
My reputation is ruined,
no one's getting near me.

26:56.916 --> 26:59.151
Hey, it's your
first day looking.

26:59.185 --> 27:01.954
You'll find something
and we're okay for now.

27:01.988 --> 27:03.255
You're gonna make up my salary

27:03.289 --> 27:04.891
with your new essay
writing business?

27:04.924 --> 27:06.826
If I need to, yes.

27:10.196 --> 27:12.298
I thought I'd talk
to your dad, actually.

27:12.331 --> 27:14.100
See if he can ask his
P.R. people for advice.

27:14.133 --> 27:16.903
Help... contain the damage.

27:16.936 --> 27:19.972
Maybe change the perception
of me out there.

27:20.006 --> 27:21.774
Unfortunately,
my publicist said

27:21.808 --> 27:23.676
that the best thing to do
is just wait it out.

27:23.710 --> 27:24.977
Really?

27:25.011 --> 27:26.312
You address things
with the press,

27:26.345 --> 27:28.781
you'll just fan the flames
and extend the story.

27:28.815 --> 27:30.316
I'm sorry, bro.

27:30.349 --> 27:31.317
Oh, it's okay.

27:31.350 --> 27:33.252
Thank you for asking.

27:33.285 --> 27:34.353
Come in.

27:36.222 --> 27:38.357
You don't have
a lock on your door.

27:38.390 --> 27:40.359
Rogelio, you just had
a serious run-in

27:40.392 --> 27:41.928
with a mentally
ill stalker.

27:41.961 --> 27:43.830
You have to be
more careful.

27:43.863 --> 27:46.933
I know, it's just
all the locks, well...

27:46.966 --> 27:49.368
that's how she kept
me prisoner, so...

27:49.401 --> 27:50.803
DINA:
So what?

27:50.837 --> 27:52.071
You still need locks.

27:52.104 --> 27:53.973
Come here, I want you
to watch something.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.141
Okay, I'll leave
you to work.

27:55.174 --> 27:56.943
Just be careful,
that's all.

27:56.976 --> 27:58.477
Enchanté.

27:58.510 --> 28:00.012
Don't speak.

28:00.046 --> 28:01.413
Just watch.

28:01.447 --> 28:03.049
(speaking Spanish)

28:06.185 --> 28:09.088
I-I don't understand.

28:09.121 --> 28:10.489
Is this the best you can do?

28:10.522 --> 28:12.491
I mean, what about
the dinosaurs?

28:12.524 --> 28:15.928
That was
a $150 million movie.

28:15.962 --> 28:17.263
We don't have that budget.

28:20.432 --> 28:21.801
Okay.

28:21.834 --> 28:25.071
Yes, you were right.

28:25.104 --> 28:26.505
I will tell her.

28:26.538 --> 28:28.074
No, no, don't say that.

28:28.107 --> 28:30.342
Let's just see
what Jane counters with.

28:30.376 --> 28:32.945
I really don't want to
move off the one month.

28:32.979 --> 28:35.347
Okay, thanks, Eileen.

28:35.381 --> 28:38.017
Wow, you're not just
automatically giving Jane

28:38.050 --> 28:39.518
everything she wants;
I'm in shock.

28:39.551 --> 28:40.920
What's that supposed to mean?

28:40.953 --> 28:42.388
Are we both really
going to pretend

28:42.421 --> 28:44.156
that Mateo's trust
and the twins' trust

28:44.190 --> 28:45.892
are exactly the same?

28:45.925 --> 28:49.762
If you die, Jane
controls Mateo's trust,

28:49.796 --> 28:50.830
but I don't control the twins'.

28:50.863 --> 28:52.464
Some lawyer does.

28:53.499 --> 28:55.835
Yes, that's correct.

28:55.868 --> 28:57.369
Look...

28:57.403 --> 28:59.205
even though you and I
are in a good place now,

28:59.238 --> 29:01.373
it hasn't always
been that way.

29:01.407 --> 29:04.243
I mean, you've done some things.

29:04.276 --> 29:06.312
(upbeat music plays)

29:13.052 --> 29:16.288
Sorry, sorry, I forgot people
 don't want to read TV.

29:16.322 --> 29:19.425
Yes, I know, okay, but...

29:19.458 --> 29:22.294
well, things are different
now, aren't they?

29:22.328 --> 29:25.231
Very different, and I like
the place that we're in...

29:26.598 --> 29:28.868
...but if you're asking me
if I trust you

29:28.901 --> 29:31.570
as much as I trust Jane...

29:31.603 --> 29:32.905
the answer is no.

29:32.939 --> 29:35.041
And you can understand

29:35.074 --> 29:37.509
why, right?

29:39.045 --> 29:40.880
So, why'd you come back?

29:40.913 --> 29:42.581
Extreme financial duress.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.016
That's not important.

29:44.050 --> 29:45.317
What's important is

29:45.351 --> 29:47.553
getting you into college,
so come on.

29:47.586 --> 29:49.588
Tell me a little
something about you.

29:49.621 --> 29:50.589
What do you like?

29:50.622 --> 29:51.290
I told you.

29:51.323 --> 29:52.558
I like helping homeless people

29:52.591 --> 29:54.260
and poor people, and...

29:54.293 --> 29:55.527
And blind people, right.

29:55.561 --> 29:58.197
Besides that.

30:00.466 --> 30:02.434
(sighs)

30:04.036 --> 30:05.905
You're into drumming?
Okay, I'm not

30:05.938 --> 30:07.173
"into" drumming.

30:07.206 --> 30:08.307
Drumming is my life.

30:08.340 --> 30:09.575
That's why I want
to study music.

30:09.608 --> 30:12.011
And there it was, a priority.

30:12.044 --> 30:14.213
Perchance even... a passion.

30:14.246 --> 30:16.548
Okay, now we're talking.

30:16.582 --> 30:17.950
No, stop, please.

30:17.984 --> 30:19.418
I know why you're firing me.

30:19.451 --> 30:21.220
I blew it.
I'd still like

30:21.253 --> 30:23.055
to use your voice
for the song, though.

30:23.089 --> 30:24.490
Of course.

30:24.523 --> 30:26.358
Actually, this is all

30:26.392 --> 30:28.094
probably for the best.

30:28.127 --> 30:30.062
It's a little hard for me
to be around you and Dina,

30:30.096 --> 30:31.197
anyway.
What?

30:31.230 --> 30:32.198
Rogelio,

30:32.231 --> 30:34.066
come on, it's obvious.

30:34.100 --> 30:38.304
Look, it's very, very casual.

30:38.337 --> 30:40.039
I don't think so.

30:40.072 --> 30:42.208
I think you like her a lot.

30:42.241 --> 30:43.309
That's ridiculous.

30:43.342 --> 30:44.343
Dina's a writer.

30:44.376 --> 30:46.612
She wears hoodies and jeans.

30:46.645 --> 30:48.347
She's not nearly glamorous,

30:48.380 --> 30:51.383
charismatic or TMZable enough
for me to be with.

30:52.384 --> 30:55.054
If you say so.

30:55.087 --> 30:57.623
(chuckles)

30:57.656 --> 31:00.960
(speaking low, indistinctly)

31:00.993 --> 31:02.494
DINA:
So, like, more singers...

31:02.528 --> 31:05.597
(gentle guitar music plays)

31:08.200 --> 31:10.202
(fast-paced piano music)

31:12.304 --> 31:14.306
*

31:18.577 --> 31:20.479
No, you take.
Stop, stop.
No, but is...

31:20.512 --> 31:22.081
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Looks like the Czech is

31:22.114 --> 31:23.249
having issues with the check.

31:23.282 --> 31:24.951
Everything okay here?

31:24.984 --> 31:25.985
Customer overpay.

31:26.018 --> 31:27.019
I didn't overpay.

31:27.053 --> 31:29.388
I'm good,
thank you, good-bye.

31:29.421 --> 31:31.090
But...
Thank you.
Have a nice day.

31:31.123 --> 31:33.592
But...
Anezka, remember,

31:33.625 --> 31:37.496
the customer
is always right.

31:37.529 --> 31:42.034
So sorry, Jane, it's
just he pay too much.

31:43.069 --> 31:45.171
Oh, my God.

31:45.204 --> 31:46.172
No, he didn't.

31:46.205 --> 31:47.239
You got a tip.

31:47.273 --> 31:48.340
What?

31:48.374 --> 31:49.175
For good service.

31:49.208 --> 31:51.177
I did?

31:51.210 --> 31:52.444
Yes.

31:52.478 --> 31:53.445
Yes, you did!

31:53.479 --> 31:56.048
You got a tip!

31:56.082 --> 31:57.249
I got a tip.
Uh-huh.

31:57.283 --> 31:58.317
I got tip!
(both laughing)

31:58.350 --> 31:59.651
It was only 3.5%,

31:59.685 --> 32:01.453
but still, a tip, a tip!

32:01.487 --> 32:02.621
Jane, there's a woman out there

32:02.654 --> 32:03.622
who wants to speak with you.

32:03.655 --> 32:05.091
Oh, okay.

32:05.124 --> 32:06.658
Be right back.

32:06.692 --> 32:08.660
Marry the salt shakers.

32:10.229 --> 32:14.000
Do you, salt,
take you, salt...

32:14.033 --> 32:15.601
What, no, stop.
(laughs)

32:15.634 --> 32:17.970
On the other hand,
 it'll keep her out of trouble.

32:18.004 --> 32:21.173
Actually,
finish the ceremony.

32:23.042 --> 32:24.343
Hi, there.

32:24.376 --> 32:25.511
The essay's a disaster.

32:25.544 --> 32:26.545
It's all about drumming.

32:26.578 --> 32:28.147
Evan wants to be a musician,

32:28.180 --> 32:29.281
it's his passion.

32:29.315 --> 32:30.416
It's a hobby.

32:30.449 --> 32:31.483
He loves music.

32:31.517 --> 32:32.751
So, he can love it,

32:32.784 --> 32:33.986
it's not a career.

32:34.020 --> 32:35.154
He's applying to

32:35.187 --> 32:36.622
the university's
economics program.

32:36.655 --> 32:39.691
Trust me, I know
what's best for my son,

32:39.725 --> 32:42.294
and I'm the one paying you
to write the essay

32:42.328 --> 32:44.096
to get him in.

32:44.130 --> 32:47.299
Remember, Jane,
 the customer is always right.

32:47.333 --> 32:49.368
Got it, I'll rewrite the essay.

32:49.401 --> 32:51.237
Thank you.

32:51.270 --> 32:53.439
(sighs)

32:53.472 --> 32:54.440
I float.

32:54.473 --> 32:56.008
You no hearing me.

32:56.042 --> 32:57.076
Good job, Anezka.

32:59.078 --> 33:01.280
Everything being okay?

33:01.313 --> 33:03.582
Yeah, it's just, uh...

33:03.615 --> 33:06.118
this mom is getting
in the way of her kid.

33:06.152 --> 33:09.488
And just like that,
 Jane realized something.

33:11.357 --> 33:14.226
I don't want to be the kind of
mom who gets in her kid's way,

33:14.260 --> 33:17.729
and travelling Europe
for a month,

33:17.763 --> 33:19.331
while totally over the top,

33:19.365 --> 33:22.201
well, it would be pretty

33:22.234 --> 33:24.470
cool for him, and even
though I can't imagine it,

33:24.503 --> 33:27.739
I don't want to
stand in his way.

33:27.773 --> 33:30.476
And it's important to you, so...

33:30.509 --> 33:32.078
Thank you.

33:32.111 --> 33:33.112
Now, let's talk about

33:33.145 --> 33:34.613
what's important to me because

33:34.646 --> 33:36.815
I'm gonna need a whole bunch
of Easters in a row

33:36.848 --> 33:38.217
if you're taking
him for a month.

33:38.250 --> 33:41.120
Yeah, okay.

33:41.153 --> 33:43.189
I think I can work with that.

33:44.656 --> 33:46.658
So, how did it work
out with Xiomara?

33:46.692 --> 33:48.527
She was great, a class act.

33:48.560 --> 33:49.628
Good.

33:49.661 --> 33:51.497
Funny thing, she kind of

33:51.530 --> 33:54.233
knew we were a thing, though.

33:54.266 --> 33:55.634
What?
Somehow,

33:55.667 --> 33:56.835
she sniffed it out.

33:56.868 --> 33:58.170
(sniffs)

33:58.204 --> 33:59.238
Did you tell her we're not?

33:59.271 --> 34:01.307
Of course, but, I mean,

34:01.340 --> 34:04.110
we kind of are though, right?

34:04.143 --> 34:05.644
What?
We've been
seeing each other

34:05.677 --> 34:08.380
every night, sexually,
things are stupendous...

34:08.414 --> 34:09.447
Stop, stop.

34:09.481 --> 34:13.752
This... is just casual, Rogelio.

34:16.155 --> 34:17.822
Good.

34:17.856 --> 34:19.391
I was just testing you,

34:19.425 --> 34:21.427
making sure you were not

34:21.460 --> 34:24.663
overly invested in me because
that can get uncomfortable.

34:24.696 --> 34:25.697
Oh.

34:25.731 --> 34:28.134
Well, don't worry, I'm not.

34:28.167 --> 34:29.168
Phew!

34:29.201 --> 34:30.302
Good.

34:33.804 --> 34:36.574
I feel good
about this.
So do I.

34:36.608 --> 34:38.310
(exhales)
I really think
as long as we both

34:38.344 --> 34:40.112
prioritize Mateo,
then we'll be fine.

34:40.146 --> 34:41.679
I totally agree.

34:41.713 --> 34:43.681
(laughs)

34:43.715 --> 34:44.716
Come on.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.284
(Jane laughs)

34:46.318 --> 34:49.188
(piano music plays)

35:03.235 --> 35:04.703
I got first tip!

35:04.736 --> 35:05.704
All because of Jane.

35:05.737 --> 35:07.873
Oh, I just loving Jane.

35:07.906 --> 35:09.208
Okay, enough about Jane already!

35:11.377 --> 35:12.844
You being okay?

35:12.878 --> 35:16.415
Yeah... yeah, no, I'm fine.

35:16.448 --> 35:18.717
I'm sorry.

35:18.750 --> 35:20.319
Jane's great.

35:20.352 --> 35:21.420
What?

35:21.453 --> 35:22.854
Nothing, we just...

35:22.888 --> 35:26.325
we have a complicated history,

35:26.358 --> 35:29.228
which mostly involves
me being horrible

35:29.261 --> 35:31.563
and Jane being a perfect
human being and sometimes...

35:31.597 --> 35:34.633
sometimes, it just
gets to be too much.

35:34.666 --> 35:38.504
What is this
complicated history?

35:38.537 --> 35:41.907
For one she... she got
accidentally, artificially

35:41.940 --> 35:44.876
inseminated, which led to...

35:53.219 --> 35:55.354
Bye. Bye.

35:55.387 --> 35:58.524
Mommy would love to play with
you, but she's got to work.

36:00.226 --> 36:01.460
Bye, bye, baby.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.229
(door closes, Mateo crying)

36:03.262 --> 36:05.731
(sighs)

36:05.764 --> 36:09.735
Well, I not thinking
Jane is perfect, not at all.

36:09.768 --> 36:11.903
Rafael does.

36:11.937 --> 36:15.374
Well... maybe that is being

36:15.407 --> 36:18.176
something that will change.

36:23.982 --> 36:28.587
Uh-oh, I think someone's
 wheels being turning...

36:28.620 --> 36:31.623
and to be fair,
 Jane is certainly not feeling

36:31.657 --> 36:33.492
so perfect at the moment.

36:40.599 --> 36:42.701
(sighs)

36:48.507 --> 36:50.576
(sighs)

37:03.489 --> 37:04.890

 Are you okay?

37:17.002 --> 37:18.270
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Only this time, Jane could

37:18.304 --> 37:19.438
no longer be silent.

37:19.471 --> 37:20.939
No, I'm not.

37:20.972 --> 37:24.476
(crying):
I'm writing this essay
on priorities

37:24.510 --> 37:26.545
and mine...

37:26.578 --> 37:29.515
they feel all wrong.

37:34.920 --> 37:38.924
I'm sorry.
No, no, no,
what's going on?

37:38.957 --> 37:42.494
I just... Rafael and I
have a custody plan,

37:42.528 --> 37:44.963
and it's good
and it works,

37:44.996 --> 37:49.034
but it means half the time,
Mateo's somewhere else.

37:49.067 --> 37:50.702
(crying):
Half the time,

37:50.736 --> 37:52.571
my heart is
somewhere else,

37:52.604 --> 37:55.040
and I just want
the time that

37:55.073 --> 37:57.376
I have with him to
be with him, you know,
Mm-hmm.

37:57.409 --> 38:00.446
and not just working so
that we can afford this house.

38:00.479 --> 38:02.047
Yeah, I get it.

38:02.080 --> 38:05.050
Why didn't you tell me
how you were feeling?

38:05.083 --> 38:08.587
I didn't want you to
feel bad, or pressured.

38:08.620 --> 38:10.856
Isn't that the whole perk
of this marriage thing?

38:10.889 --> 38:13.058
We share the pain
and the pressure.

38:14.493 --> 38:15.994
That's the whole perk?

38:16.027 --> 38:18.029
Well, okay, one of them.

38:20.632 --> 38:21.900
You don't have
to take on this

38:21.933 --> 38:23.769
whole thing
alone, anymore.

38:23.802 --> 38:27.473
So, tell that crazy lady you're
not writing her kid's essay,

38:27.506 --> 38:30.342
and we don't
have to give up

38:30.376 --> 38:31.477
the house yet, either,

38:31.510 --> 38:32.878
because I got a job.

38:32.911 --> 38:34.346
You did?

38:34.380 --> 38:36.515
A very, very temporary
job for now...

38:36.548 --> 38:37.716
because I'm not gonna sit around

38:37.749 --> 38:39.485
and wait for my name
to be cleared...

38:39.518 --> 38:42.053
so, I am working for
your father, actually.

38:42.087 --> 38:43.355
What?

38:43.389 --> 38:44.590
I'm his new chief of security.

38:44.623 --> 38:46.725
His situation
needs upgrades,

38:46.758 --> 38:48.594
systems in place...

38:48.627 --> 38:50.128
You're trying to make it
sound cool, aren't you?

38:50.161 --> 38:51.997
Yeah, a little bit.

38:52.030 --> 38:55.000
But who cares?

38:55.033 --> 38:58.637
You and Mateo are my priority.

38:58.670 --> 39:01.740
(romantic piano music plays)

39:13.519 --> 39:15.987
Don't act all shocked,
I just gave you that shift,

39:16.021 --> 39:17.055
I'm not taking it back.

39:17.088 --> 39:18.824
Scott, come on.

39:18.857 --> 39:21.427
I just need a little
more time with my son.

39:21.460 --> 39:22.694
Well, too bad.

39:22.728 --> 39:23.962
RAFAEL:
Really?

39:23.995 --> 39:25.697
'Cause I think
we can make it work.

39:27.032 --> 39:30.802
Oh, uh, of course,
of course, Mr. Solano.

39:30.836 --> 39:32.438
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Rogelio's right, huh?

39:32.471 --> 39:34.873
This nepotism thing's
 not half bad.

39:36.575 --> 39:39.545
Uh-oh, I don't like
 that look in her eyes.

39:42.113 --> 39:44.783
Huh, that's weird.

39:44.816 --> 39:46.452
That's where Jane
 goes to school.

39:58.063 --> 40:00.999
I'm sorry, I
 can't bear to watch this.

40:01.032 --> 40:03.401
(tape fast-forwarding)

40:14.780 --> 40:16.047
Anezka, no, you can't put an ad

40:16.081 --> 40:17.749
for that in the
 school newspaper!

40:17.783 --> 40:19.918
Jane could get in big trouble!

40:23.722 --> 40:25.123
I signed the estate plan.

40:25.156 --> 40:28.560
An independent trustee is fine.

40:28.594 --> 40:30.596
Thank you, and look...

40:30.629 --> 40:33.098
you have changed.

40:34.065 --> 40:35.801
I know that.

40:35.834 --> 40:38.804
It's just a-a process.

40:38.837 --> 40:43.241
Yeah, yeah, it is.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.477
And frankly, I think I've made
more improvements than you.

40:45.511 --> 40:46.945
Wait, what?
When you're up
against it,

40:46.978 --> 40:49.481
you still lie,

40:49.515 --> 40:52.818
instead of just coming clean,
facing the consequences.

40:52.851 --> 40:54.553
(sighs)

40:54.586 --> 40:56.688
I hope you change that soon.

40:56.722 --> 40:58.156
Damn, Petra!

41:05.964 --> 41:07.699
What's up?

41:11.537 --> 41:13.038
I told the police
about the boat.

41:13.071 --> 41:16.041
It was early on.

41:16.074 --> 41:18.176
It was before I knew you,
before I trusted you.

41:18.209 --> 41:21.012
But now I do,

41:21.046 --> 41:24.550
and I'm sorry I did it, but I-I
just don't want to lie about it.

41:24.583 --> 41:28.086
Well, I... really
appreciate you telling me.

41:28.119 --> 41:30.556
It's better to be honest.

41:39.931 --> 41:41.166
It's a go.

41:41.199 --> 41:42.868
Let's take him down.

41:42.901 --> 41:46.605
Oh, dear, I wish
 I'd never heard that.
