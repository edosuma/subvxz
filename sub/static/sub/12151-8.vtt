00:01.929 --> 00:03.049
Previously:

00:03.729 --> 00:06.679
Prophecies mention a Tro-Clon
that brings about ruination.

00:07.330 --> 00:10.380
Imagine what could have happened
if you'd slept with Darla.

00:10.929 --> 00:13.390
- You know I'd never do that.
- Hello, lover.

00:13.929 --> 00:14.869
- Darla.
- Darla.

00:15.130 --> 00:16.109
- Darla.
- This is impossible.

00:16.329 --> 00:17.800
Tell me about it, Daddy.

00:18.129 --> 00:19.850
You slept with her?

00:20.530 --> 00:22.600
How are you feeling?

00:24.730 --> 00:27.780
Get away! You'll be all right.
I'll kill her for this.

00:28.929 --> 00:31.699
You're gonna have to find her first.

00:32.530 --> 00:34.850
Go on. Do it.

00:35.530 --> 00:38.649
- Do it! Do it!
- The child, it has a soul.

00:39.130 --> 00:40.810
- No, it doesn't.
- It does.

00:40.929 --> 00:43.210
Whatever this thing is,
it's arriving about...

00:43.929 --> 00:46.460
...three, two, now.

00:51.130 --> 00:52.530
Just tell me where he is.

01:29.530 --> 01:32.060
- We found them.
- Go.

01:39.730 --> 01:43.489
Is your mother home, young lady?
You take us to her.

01:43.930 --> 01:47.480
Father said not to let strangers
in while he's away.

01:48.129 --> 01:50.730
We're not strangers.
You're Sarah, aren't you?

01:52.329 --> 01:55.170
We know about you.
You're the apple of your father's eye.

01:55.329 --> 01:57.219
Would strangers know that?

01:58.329 --> 02:01.810
So, lass, may two friends enter?

02:04.930 --> 02:06.299
- Is that a yes, then?
- Yes.

02:06.730 --> 02:07.739
Ah, lovely.

02:08.530 --> 02:12.110
Such a good girl. Remind me
to give you a special treat.

02:22.330 --> 02:24.650
They're trapped inside.

02:25.930 --> 02:29.439
- Your mom make you that dress?
- What's all the fuss--?

02:30.129 --> 02:32.520
- Evening to you, ma'am.
- Good evening.

02:46.330 --> 02:49.069
Burn it down if you have to.

02:52.930 --> 02:56.580
We can only stay a moment.
We have a message for your husband.

02:57.129 --> 02:58.780
You know my Daniel?

03:01.930 --> 03:04.460
What is his message?

03:04.930 --> 03:07.599
I'll give it to Sarah.

03:10.930 --> 03:12.090
On my signal.

03:12.729 --> 03:16.560
Close your eyes.
I have a surprise for you.

03:21.129 --> 03:23.689
Tell your husband, Mr. Holtz....

03:25.330 --> 03:27.360
Never mind, I'll tell him myself.

03:31.930 --> 03:34.389
Where are they?

03:56.530 --> 03:59.229
They're at my house.

04:10.930 --> 04:14.300
Can't something be done
about that horrible noise?

04:15.729 --> 04:18.750
- I think it wants its mother.
- Let's send it to her.

04:19.329 --> 04:21.120
Do you want to do it,
or should I?

05:47.529 --> 05:50.199
Are you going to do it...

05:51.730 --> 05:53.379
...or am I?

07:06.850 --> 07:09.620
I know it seems like
only a moment to you...

07:09.850 --> 07:13.680
...but 227 years have passed
since our agreement.

07:14.649 --> 07:16.470
Empires have risen and fallen.

07:16.449 --> 07:19.079
Mankind has harnessed
the power of the sun...

07:20.050 --> 07:23.069
...walked on the moon
and turned arid deserts green.

07:23.649 --> 07:28.529
What of England? Has it survived
the years and destruction?

07:29.649 --> 07:31.470
Yes.

07:32.050 --> 07:36.509
It went through a rough patch 60 years
ago, but it's mostly unchanged.

07:37.449 --> 07:42.720
Warm beer, boiled meat, bad teeth.
That's why I moved to L.A.

07:43.449 --> 07:46.329
Have you followed this history?
American Revolution...

07:47.050 --> 07:49.889
...Manifest Destiny, westward
expansion, the Beach Boys?

07:50.649 --> 07:52.399
I understand enough.

07:53.649 --> 07:58.879
One thing baffles me. These visions,
wars, the weapons of destruction.

08:00.250 --> 08:03.660
How is it no one has killed
Angelus or Darla?

08:05.050 --> 08:10.069
That's why I brought you here. Because
your fate and their fate are entwined.

08:10.449 --> 08:13.399
Then let's go. Let's finish this.
I want Angelus.

08:14.050 --> 08:18.439
I know. I want him too,
but we're going to do it right.

08:19.449 --> 08:22.009
I haven't waited two and a half
centuries to mess it up.

08:22.449 --> 08:24.519
You've been tracking him?

08:25.449 --> 08:28.540
Yes, but not in the way
that you imagine.

08:29.050 --> 08:32.740
There are other dimensions
where time behaves differently.

08:33.250 --> 08:36.090
I have an ability to navigate
those dimensions.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.409
- And is that why you haven't aged?
- Yes.

08:39.850 --> 08:43.429
That, and I've had a little work done,
mostly around the eyes.

08:44.649 --> 08:48.509
Now, get some rest.
You're going to need it.

08:55.570 --> 08:57.600
- You figure out a way to do it?
- No.

08:57.970 --> 08:59.759
I was thinking about the last time
you were here.

09:00.370 --> 09:04.129
That. Kind of hard to forget.

09:04.570 --> 09:06.289
I know. I've tried.

09:06.970 --> 09:09.850
You came in here all,
"The world's a lonely place."

09:10.570 --> 09:14.049
- I'd had a bad day.
- So you threw me through those doors...

09:14.769 --> 09:17.789
...pushed me onto the bed
and took what you wanted?

09:18.370 --> 09:21.350
Seemed like the thing to do
at the time.

09:23.769 --> 09:25.279
Come in.

09:27.970 --> 09:31.519
Sorry. We've had a breakthrough
with the scroll translations.

09:32.169 --> 09:34.870
Some verbs Wes was using
were problematic...

09:35.169 --> 09:38.929
...because of the Nyazian trick
of converting nouns and verbs...

09:39.370 --> 09:41.019
...which he discovered by--

09:41.769 --> 09:45.070
Sorry. I'll shut up so he can
tell you what he found.

09:45.370 --> 09:48.700
The Tro-Clon isn't a person.
It's a confluence of events.

09:49.570 --> 09:54.139
It not only involves you, Darla and the
child, but other things we don't know.

09:54.970 --> 09:58.230
Doesn't it mean the kid
isn't this evil thing we feared?

09:58.570 --> 10:01.549
Not necessarily. There are
a few Nyazian phrases...

10:02.169 --> 10:05.009
...related to its birth
that I haven't completed.

10:05.769 --> 10:08.889
- It's important you do.
- We need to know what's in the oven.

10:09.370 --> 10:13.090
I know one thing about it.
Something's protecting it.

10:14.169 --> 10:18.000
- How do you know that?
- Because I can't get rid of it.

10:18.970 --> 10:20.269
Sorry I asked.

10:20.769 --> 10:23.789
If I shot this in your stomach,
it wouldn't do anything?

10:24.970 --> 10:27.570
- Fire away.
- No one's firing anything.

10:27.970 --> 10:31.659
Angel's right. Something wants
this thing to come to term.

10:32.169 --> 10:35.889
- After it's born, chop its head off.
- What if it doesn't have one?

10:36.370 --> 10:39.350
- We'll need a big mallet.
- A net. Or a flamethrower.

10:39.970 --> 10:42.809
Flamethrower?
There'll be no throwing of flames.

10:43.570 --> 10:45.889
Not until we know what's going on.

10:46.570 --> 10:50.960
If anybody has a problem with that,
they should leave now.

10:53.769 --> 10:55.590
Not you.

10:59.769 --> 11:03.139
Come on, guys. How about it?

11:08.169 --> 11:10.379
- Cordy?
- You want me to protect...

11:10.570 --> 11:13.980
...the vampire bitch who bit me
and her evil love child?

11:17.769 --> 11:18.679
Okay, I'm in.

11:18.970 --> 11:20.049
Ow!

11:20.169 --> 11:23.049
You're a vampire. A punch in
the nose shouldn't hurt that much.

11:23.769 --> 11:27.629
Not, "Ow, her nose."
She's having contractions.

11:58.929 --> 12:01.279
- Morning, Ms. Morgan.
- Morning.

12:05.529 --> 12:07.879
Could you take this to Pinderhook
in Demon Resources for me?

12:08.529 --> 12:09.970
Sure.

12:12.730 --> 12:13.779
Uh....

12:13.929 --> 12:18.990
Ms. Morgan, I hate to bother you,
but I've admired you for a while and--

12:19.929 --> 12:24.389
- I don't date guys from the mailroom.
- Me neither.

12:25.929 --> 12:28.700
I just thought you should know
about this.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.299
Wait.

12:45.730 --> 12:49.659
You weasel. You think you can blackmail
your way onto me on my desk--

12:50.529 --> 12:52.070
No. You got it all wrong.

12:52.330 --> 12:55.629
I respect you way too much
to be attracted to you.

12:55.929 --> 12:59.049
It's just, down in the mailroom,
I see a lot, you know?

13:00.129 --> 13:02.409
Different factions in the firm.

13:02.529 --> 13:06.289
There comes a time
when a guy has to choose a side.

13:07.330 --> 13:12.350
And is that disk your way of telling
me you're choosing my side?

13:13.330 --> 13:15.580
Who are we allied against,
you and I?

13:15.730 --> 13:18.570
- Who is this common foe?
- I'd rather not--

13:19.330 --> 13:23.860
If you don't tell me right now,
I am gonna have your skin peeled off...

13:24.730 --> 13:27.399
...and stapled back on inside out.

13:27.730 --> 13:29.029
Mr. Park.

13:29.529 --> 13:31.419
Gavin.

13:34.330 --> 13:37.000
Remember those exterminators
he sent to Angel's hotel?

13:37.330 --> 13:40.490
They don't kill bugs,
they plant them.

13:42.129 --> 13:43.250
Hm.

13:53.730 --> 13:56.149
Good, That's it,
Where's your weight?

13:56.730 --> 13:59.049
Balls of your feet?
Don't forget to follow,

13:59.129 --> 14:00.320
Oh, God! You said....

14:00.929 --> 14:05.809
"Ke-yi, ha, yawa, ow. "
Someone doing an incantation?

14:06.330 --> 14:09.700
No. Angel started training Female 1
in martial arts.

14:10.529 --> 14:13.299
- I think she got in a lucky punch.
- Hm.

14:14.129 --> 14:17.679
- Any tech problems?
- Just a couple. Don't sweat it, though.

14:18.330 --> 14:23.039
That is a transcription
of everything up to last week.

14:24.929 --> 14:26.090
How about that?

14:26.730 --> 14:30.379
I just asked myself, "If I were
a cockroach, where would I hide?"

14:30.929 --> 14:34.720
And there you are! Did you really
think you could blackmail me?

14:35.129 --> 14:38.080
Blackmail? No one cares.

14:38.730 --> 14:42.029
Bumping uglies with an old man
who body-jumped into a vampire...

14:42.929 --> 14:45.809
...is the closest you've been
to a relationship in years.

14:46.529 --> 14:49.299
This is about something else.

14:49.529 --> 14:51.210
Thank you, Cyril.

14:51.929 --> 14:53.820
You're welcome, sir.

14:54.330 --> 14:56.289
What was that crap
about choosing sides?

14:56.730 --> 14:59.289
He did. He's on mine.

15:00.929 --> 15:04.580
Is this your convoluted, pathetic way
of asking for my help?

15:05.730 --> 15:09.590
Because you sure need it.
You're understaffed, underfunded...

15:10.529 --> 15:14.289
...and clearly undertalented.
So, what have we learned here?

15:14.730 --> 15:17.080
We? There is no we.

15:17.730 --> 15:20.120
It was time you understood
the full scope...

15:20.730 --> 15:23.399
...of what I've been doing
these past few months.

15:23.730 --> 15:27.590
Who is this unidentified
pregnant female?

15:30.330 --> 15:33.769
I don't know. We lost audio
for a couple of days last week.

15:34.529 --> 15:37.830
- I can pull the tape.
- See? Need me.

15:50.129 --> 15:53.460
- Darla?
- Impossible. Vampires can't give birth.

15:54.330 --> 15:56.649
Tell me about it.

15:58.529 --> 16:00.529
- Yeah?
- Linwood, it's Lilah.

16:00.929 --> 16:04.049
You're not gonna believe
what I'm looking at.

16:06.929 --> 16:09.419
How long since the last contraction?

16:09.929 --> 16:13.259
About 20 minutes.
They're still real irregular.

16:13.529 --> 16:16.940
- Something's wrong. The pain....
- You like pain.

16:17.730 --> 16:20.820
This is different.
I want it out. Now!

16:21.330 --> 16:24.169
That's what's happening.
The first stage of labor.

16:24.929 --> 16:27.419
That's good, right?
How long does it last?

16:27.929 --> 16:30.460
It varies.
The whole thing, maybe 18 hours.

16:30.929 --> 16:34.860
Eighteen hours?
No, that's too long.

16:36.929 --> 16:41.070
All right, okay.
Easy. Just lie down.

16:42.330 --> 16:44.539
I'll be right back.

16:46.529 --> 16:50.220
We gotta figure out what's inside
of her before it skitters out.

16:51.330 --> 16:55.720
We should get a demony doctor who
knows how her vampire girl-parts work.

16:56.129 --> 16:59.360
- You know what I'm saying.
- Didn't she try that shaman thing?

17:00.330 --> 17:01.490
Yeah, she did.

17:01.529 --> 17:05.180
I don't suppose she ever went
to a normal doctor or a hospital?

17:06.329 --> 17:10.579
There's an idea. A hospital.
Oh, wait. They don't admit vampires.

17:11.130 --> 17:14.539
- Who says we have to admit?
- We don't need the right doctor.

17:15.329 --> 17:16.380
We just need the right equipment.

17:22.130 --> 17:26.589
I don't care. Just find somebody
who can answer the bloody question.

17:27.529 --> 17:30.299
Heads will roll if the senior partners
hear of this.

17:30.529 --> 17:32.670
They won't.
That's why we came to you.

17:33.529 --> 17:35.950
Darla, pregnant. How'd we miss it?

17:36.529 --> 17:39.549
I'm sequestering the psychics
in the conference room.

17:40.130 --> 17:42.089
We'll get to the bottom of this.

17:42.529 --> 17:44.849
A man works hard...

17:44.930 --> 17:48.299
...builds something, waters it...

17:49.130 --> 17:52.500
...grows rich and powerful...

17:53.329 --> 17:56.490
...leaves his wife
for a younger beauty.

17:56.930 --> 18:01.880
These are the reasons
we take certain blood oaths.

18:03.529 --> 18:07.220
And to have it all vanish because....

18:09.529 --> 18:13.319
I can't stress enough. There's
no way we could have foreseen this.

18:13.730 --> 18:16.640
She's right, sir.
No one could have known.

18:26.329 --> 18:28.859
Hi, you've reached the Tittles,

18:29.329 --> 18:33.119
- For Christine, press one,
- For Bentley, press two,

18:34.130 --> 18:37.180
Or to speak to or worship
Master Tarfall...

18:37.730 --> 18:41.589
...Underlord of Pain, press three,

18:42.529 --> 18:46.430
Master, it's happened. The thing
you have foreseen has come to be.

18:47.329 --> 18:49.930
We must tell the others.

19:28.650 --> 19:31.210
Another step, and it'll be your last.

19:32.250 --> 19:35.619
If you haven't come for a fight,
you're in the wrong place.

19:35.849 --> 19:38.900
A fight's exactly
what I'm looking for.

19:41.849 --> 19:44.660
Then be a man and show your face.

19:46.049 --> 19:48.470
I'm not a man.

19:53.250 --> 19:55.779
What I mean is....

19:56.250 --> 20:00.779
- You're not human.
- But masculine. You get that, right?

20:01.650 --> 20:04.490
You'll get more than a fight
if you don't leave.

20:05.250 --> 20:08.130
Fine. My mistake.

20:09.450 --> 20:12.680
I thought you might want help
killing Angelus and Darla.

20:13.049 --> 20:15.930
I don't need your help.
I'll kill them myself.

20:16.650 --> 20:21.069
Not to rain on your parade,
but, no, you won't.

20:22.049 --> 20:24.890
You'll die a bitter man
and never see them again.

20:25.049 --> 20:27.440
- You don't know that.
- I kind of do.

20:28.650 --> 20:30.609
It'll be over 200 years...

20:31.049 --> 20:35.019
...before you get another chance
to confront Angelus or Darla.

20:35.250 --> 20:39.670
Is this where the demon offers the
broken man a chance to change that?

20:41.250 --> 20:44.799
I'll take you to them,
two centuries into the future.

20:45.450 --> 20:48.710
- Through black magic and sorcery.
- No, on a mule cart.

20:49.049 --> 20:52.170
Of course through black magic
and sorcery. I'm a demon.

20:53.250 --> 20:55.710
- What do you want from me?
- Your word.

20:56.250 --> 21:01.339
I want your word that when the time
comes, you will show them no mercy.

21:09.450 --> 21:13.700
I don't mean to be pushy,
but this is a limited time offer.

21:14.250 --> 21:17.369
Say yes, and I'll take you
to them this very hour.

21:18.450 --> 21:23.789
Say no, and realize the one chance
to avenge your wife and children...

21:24.450 --> 21:27.930
...has slipped away forever.

21:35.849 --> 21:37.990
How you feeling?

21:38.250 --> 21:43.619
I haven't had blood in a day, and your
spawn is trying to rip its way out.

21:44.849 --> 21:47.450
Paging Dr. Angel.

21:50.849 --> 21:55.309
I sent Gunn for an ultrasound
machine so we can look inside Darla.

21:56.250 --> 21:58.880
- Is this a classroom?
- It's a teaching hospital.

21:59.250 --> 22:00.900
How are you feeling, Darla?

22:03.450 --> 22:05.170
Something wrong?

22:05.849 --> 22:10.200
- I think the contractions have stopped.
- Is that bad?

22:12.450 --> 22:14.910
- Do you mind if I--?
- I won't bite.

22:15.450 --> 22:18.539
No, but that thing inside might.

22:25.650 --> 22:29.650
It may have been Braxton-Hicks
contractions. A form of false labor.

22:30.450 --> 22:33.640
- False?
- As in, not ready to come out yet.

22:34.650 --> 22:38.160
I'm way past ready.
I'd cut it out if I could.

22:39.450 --> 22:43.839
- Here you go. One ultrasound machine.
- Darla, up on the table.

22:44.849 --> 22:47.339
Don't you wanna see what's inside?

23:02.250 --> 23:04.849
You've kept me here long enough.
Where are they?

23:05.250 --> 23:08.549
- It's not that simple.
- I'm tired of waiting!

23:10.650 --> 23:14.160
Like I said, it's not that simple.

23:15.450 --> 23:18.680
You think I'd transport you
two and a half centuries...

23:19.049 --> 23:23.089
...if I could walk up to Angelus
and stake him myself? Please.

23:23.849 --> 23:28.200
There are rules and forces at work
far greater than either of us.

23:31.650 --> 23:36.180
Boy, you vengeful types aren't
real good at playing with others.

23:42.450 --> 23:45.049
It's my street face.

23:47.250 --> 23:51.319
Now, put that on.
I've lined up some men to help us.

23:52.529 --> 23:58.259
Are you now
or have you ever been a vampire?

23:59.730 --> 24:02.049
Are any of your friends vampires?

24:02.730 --> 24:04.240
Seven of Cups.

24:04.529 --> 24:06.180
Queen of Swords.

24:06.329 --> 24:08.579
Jack of Wands.

24:09.329 --> 24:12.559
Thank you for coming.
And correct me if I'm wrong...

24:12.930 --> 24:16.160
...but the role of a psychic
is to be psychic.

24:17.130 --> 24:19.130
To predict the future...

24:19.529 --> 24:22.829
...so Wolfram and Hart isn't
in this kind of predicament.

24:23.730 --> 24:25.900
I can't apologize enough, sir.

24:26.130 --> 24:28.869
You're right, you can't.

24:30.329 --> 24:32.190
I'm not without compassion.

24:32.730 --> 24:37.119
I'll give you a chance to save
your job and your skin.

24:41.130 --> 24:45.059
No, you're not.
You're gonna have me killed.

24:45.930 --> 24:49.549
Why couldn't you have had
such foresight when we needed it?

24:52.529 --> 24:55.089
We are telling the truth.

24:55.529 --> 24:57.210
Thank you.

24:57.930 --> 25:01.619
Intelligence is coming in.
No one knows how Darla got pregnant.

25:02.730 --> 25:05.569
There's a prophecy
involving a vampire birth...

25:05.730 --> 25:08.329
... but the scroll it' s recorded on
is missing.

25:09.329 --> 25:12.170
Do you have any idea
how many groups and cults...

25:12.329 --> 25:14.859
...would kill to get their hands
on this baby?

25:15.329 --> 25:18.349
- We gotta get it before anybody knows.
- And we will.

25:19.529 --> 25:24.099
We need to get it, dissect it
and find out what it means.

25:24.930 --> 25:26.160
Berlin on the phone.

25:26.730 --> 25:30.839
If they've heard about this in Berlin,
Muncie can't be far behind.

25:31.529 --> 25:34.759
If the senior partners are looking
to assign blame...

25:35.130 --> 25:37.829
...the buck stops here,
you understand me?

25:38.730 --> 25:39.960
Not exactly, sir.

25:39.930 --> 25:44.880
If the partners are looking to place
blame, I'll have to step forward.

25:45.930 --> 25:47.259
That's inspiring, sir.

25:47.730 --> 25:51.240
Yes. I'll step forward and blame you.

25:51.930 --> 25:57.160
Darla was resurrected on your watch.
I can think of no better scapegoat.

26:02.730 --> 26:05.960
You think this is over?
Watch and learn, rookie.

26:33.930 --> 26:35.259
Yes?

26:37.529 --> 26:39.700
I understand.

27:11.930 --> 27:15.049
Well, then, let's take a look,
shall we?

27:17.930 --> 27:20.140
I haven't studied
one of these for a while.

27:20.329 --> 27:23.380
- Isn't that a head?
- I think it is.

27:23.930 --> 27:27.339
- Or is that the head?
- Maybe you're both right.

27:29.930 --> 27:33.549
It's not like I'm suggesting
it's an evil two-headed thing.

27:37.130 --> 27:39.230
I see it.

27:39.529 --> 27:40.930
My little parasite.

27:41.930 --> 27:45.299
- Oh, my....
- What is it?

27:46.130 --> 27:48.380
- It's human.
- Human, as in humanoid?

27:48.529 --> 27:51.089
As in cannibalistic,
underground dwellers?

27:51.529 --> 27:52.829
No.

27:53.329 --> 27:56.140
Human as in.... A boy.

27:56.930 --> 27:58.369
- A boy?
- A boy.

28:00.529 --> 28:04.150
A boy. You're carrying a boy.

28:05.329 --> 28:06.490
Great.

28:08.329 --> 28:11.980
I'm gonna have a son.
I'm gonna have a son.

28:12.529 --> 28:17.480
Guys, as fascinating as an ultrasound
image may appear, you should--

28:18.529 --> 28:21.019
Me, a father...

28:21.529 --> 28:24.130
...to a son.
Do you know what that means?

28:24.529 --> 28:27.829
- We're surrounded by vampires?
- No, it's a human boy--

28:32.930 --> 28:36.259
We are surrounded by vampires.

28:38.329 --> 28:43.250
- So who has a plan?
- "Don't let them kill us" sounds good.

28:44.329 --> 28:46.859
Behold the Miracle Child.

28:47.329 --> 28:49.119
The Miracle Child.

28:49.730 --> 28:53.099
- For his time has come.
- The Miracle Child.

28:53.930 --> 28:55.750
The Miracle Child.

28:56.329 --> 28:59.069
Praise be. Praise be.

28:59.329 --> 29:00.660
Praise be.

29:10.650 --> 29:14.509
The buildings are taller,
the machines more powerful.

29:15.450 --> 29:19.559
And you can get really great
Thai food at 2 in the morning.

29:20.250 --> 29:23.269
People today are the same
as they were in your day.

29:23.849 --> 29:27.329
They drink, they fight,
they work hard, they fall in love.

29:28.049 --> 29:32.049
- They have families.
- Yes, they still have families.

29:32.849 --> 29:37.029
I hope these men you've hired
are ruthless bastards.

29:41.849 --> 29:45.039
- Go away!
- It's Sahjhan.

29:46.049 --> 29:48.930
This is where we'll get your men.

29:50.849 --> 29:53.380
Very exclusive.

30:02.849 --> 30:04.990
These aren't men.

30:05.849 --> 30:09.849
Once again, gender, not species.
I should have said minions.

30:12.450 --> 30:15.289
Have you seen Grappler demons fight?

30:16.650 --> 30:21.069
Not the sharpest pencils in the box
but merciless in battle.

30:22.049 --> 30:26.259
Okay, guys, over here.
Time to meet the new jefe,

30:26.849 --> 30:29.759
And, Flarmar, leave the head
in the ring, okay?

30:31.049 --> 30:34.809
- Ready to command your troops?
- Any other surprises I should know?

30:36.450 --> 30:40.839
I'm all for being worshipped,
but what the hell is going on?

30:41.849 --> 30:43.990
- What do you want?
- To protect the Miracle Child.

30:44.250 --> 30:47.619
That's good.
We're here for the same thing.

30:50.250 --> 30:51.789
Die!

31:03.450 --> 31:07.799
As it has been prophesied
by our great potentate, Ul-Thar...

31:08.849 --> 31:12.109
...we vow our lives
to protect this special child.

31:13.049 --> 31:15.299
Hear that? Our kid, special.

31:15.450 --> 31:19.240
Let's kill the humans and use
their blood to nourish the mother...

31:20.250 --> 31:22.670
- ...and her Miracle Child.
- Miracle Child.

31:23.250 --> 31:26.059
Guess I'm getting dinner after all.

31:29.930 --> 31:33.019
This should provide your ops
unit with a tactical base.

31:33.529 --> 31:37.009
Plan and elevation drawings
of every floor in Angel's hotel.

31:37.730 --> 31:41.660
I have surveillance capabilities
to monitor the engagement from here.

31:42.529 --> 31:45.900
Excellent. I'm confident
my men will capture the target.

31:46.730 --> 31:50.940
The larger question revolves around
the extraction of the target's cargo.

31:51.529 --> 31:54.619
- Getting the baby from Darla.
- Of course.

31:55.130 --> 31:58.750
- For that we've called in an expert.
- You flatter me, sir.

31:59.329 --> 32:04.279
May I introduce Dr. Fetvanovich
from our office in the Balkans?

32:05.329 --> 32:07.400
- How do you do?
- He is a specialist...

32:07.730 --> 32:12.299
...in paranormal obstetrics. We are
very fortunate he's consented to help.

32:13.130 --> 32:17.700
It is I who feel fortunate.
A vampire birth is...

32:19.130 --> 32:21.269
...unprecedented.

32:22.130 --> 32:26.799
I look forward to dissecting
both the mother and the child.

32:29.930 --> 32:31.609
You might wanna join the fight.

32:31.730 --> 32:35.279
Sorry. I'm gonna have to be
Switzerland and sit this one out.

32:36.529 --> 32:39.619
You said you were just gonna
kill the humans, right?

32:40.730 --> 32:42.480
Yes, just the humans.

32:43.130 --> 32:45.450
We will nourish you,
slice you open...

32:46.130 --> 32:49.319
...wear your entrails as a belt
and eat your eyeballs...

32:49.730 --> 32:51.450
...before we worship
the Miracle Child.

32:52.130 --> 32:54.549
- Miracle Child.
- Okay, I'm in.

32:55.130 --> 32:58.220
Gunn, we'll hold them off.
The rest of you, get Darla to the car.

32:58.730 --> 33:01.990
I'd rather fight.
Show these youngsters real carnage.

33:02.329 --> 33:04.289
That's thoughtful, but go.

33:04.730 --> 33:07.049
Charles, do you have
an extra dagger?

33:07.730 --> 33:09.450
- This okay?
- Perfect.

33:10.130 --> 33:12.019
On my count of three. One, two--

33:12.529 --> 33:16.150
You make one move, and I'll slice
the Miracle Kid into triplets.

33:16.730 --> 33:18.619
It's always the quiet ones.

33:19.130 --> 33:20.460
Wait!

33:20.930 --> 33:23.529
They don't know
the knife can't hurt the baby.

33:23.930 --> 33:28.180
They do now.
Vampires have great hearing.

33:31.130 --> 33:33.059
Here we go.

33:49.130 --> 33:50.460
Everybody out!

34:18.530 --> 34:19.900
All clear.

34:20.929 --> 34:23.250
We're clear, Alpha, move in,

34:24.530 --> 34:26.349
Let's go, men.

34:27.530 --> 34:29.739
Upstairs. Go!

34:30.530 --> 34:32.599
Alpha Team, move out.

34:33.530 --> 34:35.039
Delta Team, behind me.

34:35.329 --> 34:37.329
Lobby secured, sir.

34:39.530 --> 34:41.599
Let's set up out here.

34:41.929 --> 34:43.929
Oh, and get a hose.

34:44.329 --> 34:47.280
I'm afraid there might be some blood.

34:48.530 --> 34:51.969
And you can set the baby's cage
next to Mama's.

35:00.849 --> 35:02.989
- I think we lost them.
- Anybody hurt?

35:03.250 --> 35:05.639
Nothing Band-Aids
and ice cream can't fix.

35:06.250 --> 35:08.710
- I'm good.
- Darla? Darla, everything okay?

35:09.849 --> 35:11.110
Yeah, fine.

35:12.250 --> 35:15.090
- You all right?
- It's nothing.

35:16.449 --> 35:18.519
It's the kid, isn't it?

35:18.849 --> 35:21.340
Seeing him on the monitor?

35:21.849 --> 35:26.239
No, I'm just disappointed
the vamp cult didn't kill all of you.

35:27.849 --> 35:32.099
So where are we going? I'm famished,
and we know how ugly that can get.

35:32.650 --> 35:34.650
- Where are we going?
- Somewhere safe.

35:35.050 --> 35:37.150
Where's safe? Hotel's definitely out.

35:38.050 --> 35:39.840
- How about--?
- Vegas? Sorry.

35:39.849 --> 35:42.199
Too high-profile.
But we need to get out.

35:42.849 --> 35:45.380
- Actually--
- I hate it when you say that.

35:45.849 --> 35:48.239
"Actually" means
your oversized brain...

35:48.849 --> 35:51.900
...thought of something
we failed to consider, right?

35:52.449 --> 35:56.170
Just other people know more about
this kid's importance than we do.

35:57.250 --> 36:00.159
The only thing that can help us
is at the hotel.

36:00.250 --> 36:03.940
We can't protect your child
unless we get the scrolls.

36:05.650 --> 36:08.280
Okay then, quick stop.

36:59.650 --> 37:02.670
- Is this man with you?
- Where's Angelus?

37:05.650 --> 37:09.440
Who is this pirate with the sword,
and what is he doing there?

37:09.849 --> 37:14.590
I don't know, sir. But he called
Angel by his old name, Angelus.

37:15.250 --> 37:18.090
- I need better audio.
- Any second.

37:18.849 --> 37:20.320
- Hand over the vampires,
- He's covered, sir,

37:20.650 --> 37:22.679
This has gone on long enough.

37:23.050 --> 37:27.159
I don't care who that man is,
take him out. Take him out now.

37:27.849 --> 37:30.480
- Over.
- Take him out!

37:32.050 --> 37:34.369
This should be sweet.

37:37.449 --> 37:39.769
- Picture!
- I'm working on it, sir.

37:40.449 --> 37:43.469
Stop it! Gentlemen, please!

37:44.050 --> 37:47.280
- Burke's never lost.
- It'll be over in just a second.

37:50.050 --> 37:52.579
That should do it.

37:53.650 --> 37:55.900
Anybody there?

37:57.250 --> 37:59.139
Over?

38:09.010 --> 38:13.820
- Why are you stopping here?
- It's a few blocks. I'll go on foot.

38:14.409 --> 38:18.099
- Who says you get to be wheelman?
- Who says it has to be a man?

38:18.610 --> 38:20.260
- The scrolls?
- In the office.

38:21.010 --> 38:23.889
If I'm not back in five,
leave without me.

38:25.809 --> 38:28.690
- Leave to where?
- Anywhere. Somewhere safe.

38:29.409 --> 38:31.019
Angel?

38:31.210 --> 38:32.650
Yeah?

38:36.010 --> 38:38.610
Just get out of here.

39:31.210 --> 39:33.099
Angelus.

39:37.210 --> 39:39.769
I've been looking for you.

39:42.610 --> 39:45.030
- He said five.
- It's been six and a half.
