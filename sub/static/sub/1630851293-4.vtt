00:31.000 --> 00:32.000
WELCOME TO THE SHOW, STILL

00:32.000 --> 00:33.000
TAKING PLACE IN THIS BLANK VOID,

00:33.000 --> 00:34.000
NOW, SADLY, APPROACHING ITS

00:34.000 --> 00:36.000
FIRST BIRTHDAY.

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
AND, LIKE MOST ONE-YEAR-OLDS,

00:38.000 --> 00:39.000
IT DOESN'T REALLY DO MUCH OTHER

00:39.000 --> 00:40.000
THAN TERRIFY YOU WHEN IT'S

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
QUIET AND VAGUELY SMELL LIKE

OLD MILK.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
IT'S BEEN A WILD WEEK,

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
FROM ANDREW CUOMO'S SCANDALS

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
CONTINUING TO GROW, TO EIGHT

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
MODERATE DEMOCRATS KILLING A

$15 MINIMUM WAGE -- WITH

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
KYRSTEN SINEMA DOING IT

IN A PARTICULARLY DICKISH WAY --

OH, THUMBS DOWN!

00:54.000 --> 00:56.000
FUN!

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
TO THE FACT THAT

00:57.000 --> 00:58.000
THE MILWAUKEE BUCKS RECENTLY

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
STARTED WELCOMING LIMITED

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
NUMBERS OF FANS BACK INTO

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
THEIR ARENA, AND DID IT LIKE

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
THIS.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
>> THE HAND SANITIZER CAM!

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
LET'S GET THOSE HANDS CLEAN!

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
YOU MIGHT HAVE TO WASH YOUR HAIR

01:10.000 --> 01:10.000
IT.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
RIGHT ON THE HOODIE.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
GREAT JOB, BANGO, HE'S, LIKE,

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
GIVE ME ALL THE HAND SANITIZER,

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
KEEP ME CLEAN!

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
I DON'T KNOW IF WE WANT TO

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
RECOMMEND THAT, LET'S NOT DO

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
THAT.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000

01:20.000 --> 01:21.000
LET'S NOT DO ANY OF THAT!

01:21.000 --> 01:23.000
BECAUSE GETTING BUKKAKED BY

01:24.000 --> 01:25.000
A CARTOON SQUIRT BOTTLE HAS TO

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
BE THE MOST AWKWARD WAY TO WIND

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
UP ON A JUMBOTRON, RIGHT AFTER

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
BEING FEATURED ON THE KISS CAM

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
WITH YOUR SIBLING, AND BEING

01:30.000 --> 01:31.000
PROPOSED TO ON A FIRST DATE.

01:31.000 --> 01:32.000
NO, ERIC!

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
FOR VARIOUS REASONS, NO!

01:34.000 --> 01:35.000
AND WHY IS EVERYONE BOOING ME?

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
WE JUST MET!

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
PRETTY MUCH DO AWAY WITH

01:44.000 --> 01:45.000
GOVERNMENT COVID RESTRICTIONS.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
>> TEXAS GOVERNOR GREG ABBOTT

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
SAYS FALLING HOSPITALIZATIONS

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
AND INCREASED VACCINATIONS MEAN

01:51.000 --> 01:51.000
NO

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
STATE MANDATES ARE NO LONGER

01:53.000 --> 01:54.000
NEEDED, AND IT'S UP TO

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES

01:55.000 --> 01:57.000
TO BEHAVE RESPONSIBLY.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
>> ALL BUSINESSES OF ANY TYPE

02:00.000 --> 02:00.000
NO

02:00.000 --> 02:04.000
ARE ALLOWED TO OPEN 100%

02:04.000 --> 02:04.000
NO

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
ALSO, I AM ENDING THE STATEWIDE

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
MASK MANDATE.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
>> John: WELL, THAT'S FUCKING

02:12.000 --> 02:12.000
NO

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
STUPID.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
LIFTING ALL RESTRICTIONS IS

02:15.000 --> 02:16.000
RIDICULOUS WHEN WE'RE STILL

02:16.000 --> 02:17.000
NO

02:17.000 --> 02:18.000
IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC --

02:18.000 --> 02:18.000
AS EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
INSTEAD OF FORCING PEOPLE TO

02:20.000 --> 02:21.000
KISS, WE'RE SQUIRTING THEM

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
WITH CARTOON EJACULATE.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
AND THE THING IS, LEAVING IT UP

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
TO INDIVIDUALS TO "BEHAVE

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
NO

02:28.000 --> 02:29.000
RESPONSIBLY" IS LIKELY TO CAUSE

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
IMMEDIATE PROBLEMS.

02:30.000 --> 02:30.000
NO

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
BECAUSE WHILE BUSINESSES CAN

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
STILL REQUIRE PEOPLE TO WEAR

02:32.000 --> 02:33.000
NO

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
MASKS, THE LACK OF A STATEWIDE

02:34.000 --> 02:39.000
MANDATE COULD MAKE THINGS

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
DIFFICULT FOR THEM, AS THIS

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
BAR OWNER WILL TELL YOU.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
>> YOU KNOW, WE'RE VERY USED

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
TO MAKING PEOPLE DO WHAT THEY

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
DON'T WANT TO DO.

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN I.D.,

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
YOU CAN'T DRIVE DRUNK.

02:46.000 --> 02:46.000
THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE, WITHOUT

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
A MANDATE FROM THE GOVERNMENT,

02:47.000 --> 02:49.000
MAKES IT SEEM LIKE AN OPTIONAL

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
THING, AND SOMETHING THEY WANT

02:50.000 --> 02:51.000
TO ARGUE ABOUT.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
THE STATE ITSELF COULD GIVE US

02:53.000 --> 02:54.000
THE COVER TO SAY, IT'S NOT ME,

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
IT'S THEM.

02:57.000 --> 02:58.000
>> John: YEAH, THAT MAKES SENSE!

02:58.000 --> 02:59.000
ALTHOUGH I WILL SAY, CBS REALLY

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
DIDN'T HAVE TO TELL US HE WAS

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
THE OWNER OF A BAR CALLED

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
"THE COTTONMOUTH CLUB."

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
GIVEN THAT HAT, THERE WERE

03:04.000 --> 03:06.000
REALLY ONLY THREE OPTIONS:

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
BAR OWNER, SKA BAND HYPE MAN,

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
AND SPACE MECHANIC.

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
THAT'S IT.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
AND WHILE I DO TAKE HIS LARGER

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
POINT, THAT IT'S SHITTY TO

03:15.000 --> 03:16.000
MAKE BAR AND RESTAURANT

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
EMPLOYEES RESPONSIBLE FOR

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
ENFORCING PUBLIC SAFETY, I'M

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
GUESSING HE PERSONALLY HAS

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
THE CONFIDENCE TO DO THAT, GIVEN

03:21.000 --> 03:21.000
THAT HE WENT ON CBS THIS MORNING

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
IN "THE FULL PHARRELL"

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
MEANWHILE, THIS WEEK THE FEDERAL

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN BUSY.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
IN ADDITION TO THE SENATE

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
FINALLY PASSING THE COVID RELIEF

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
BILL, THE FBI DIRECTOR GAVE SOME

03:30.000 --> 03:31.000
SIGNIFICANT TESTIMONY.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.000
>> IN HIS FIRST APPEARANCE

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
BEFORE CONGRESS SINCE THE

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
JANUARY 6TH INSURRECTION,

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
FBI DIRECTOR CHRISTOPHER WRAY

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
WAS SPECIFIC AND BLUNT ABOUT

03:39.000 --> 03:42.000
WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
>> QUITE A NUMBER OF WHAT WE

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
WOULD CALL SORT OF "MILITIA

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
VIOLENT EXTREMISTS" --

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
PROUD BOYS OR THE OATH KEEPERS.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
WE'VE ALREADY IDENTIFIED

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
INDIVIDUALS WHO ADVOCATE FOR

03:51.000 --> 03:51.000
WHAT YOU WOULD CALL

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
WHITE SUPREMACY.

03:53.000 --> 03:54.000
>> AND WHAT OF THE CONSPIRACIES

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
CLAIMING THAT IT WAS REALLY

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
LEFT WING RADICALS POSING AS

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
TRUMP SUPPORTERS WHO ATTACKED

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
THE CAPITOL?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.000
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY EVIDENCE THAT

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
THE CAPITOL ATTACK WAS ORGANIZED

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
BY "FAKE TRUMP PROTESTERS?"

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
>> WE HAVE NOT SEEN EVIDENCE OF

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
THAT.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
>> John: YEAH, OF COURSE YOU

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
HAVEN'T, BECAUSE IT'S NOT

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
FUCKING TRUE.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
AND DESPITE EVERYTHING,

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
IT'S STILL AMAZING THAT HE HAS

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
TO DEBUNK A CONSPIRACY THEORY

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
THAT'S SO CLEARLY FALSE.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.000
IT'D BE LIKE HAVING TO SWEAR

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
UNDER OATH THAT THREE LEMURS

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
IN A TRENCH COAT DIDN'T COMMIT

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
THE OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBING.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
OF COURSE THEY DIDN'T, AND

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
ANYONE WHO SUGGESTED THEY DID

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
CLEARLY HAS SOME SIGNIFICANTLY

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
BIGGER PROBLEMS.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.000
NOW THAT TESTIMONY WAS PRETTY

04:28.000 --> 04:30.000
NEWSWORTHY.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
BUT WHILE SOME NETWORKS

04:31.000 --> 04:32.000
TOOK THE HEARINGS LIVE, FOX,

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
UNSURPRISINGLY, BARELY

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
COVERED IT.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
IN FACT, ACROSS CONSERVATIVE

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
MEDIA, YOU'D HARDLY KNOW IT HAD

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
HAPPENED.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO BUSY WITH

04:41.000 --> 04:41.000
THIS.

04:41.000 --> 04:44.000
>> DR. SEUSS GETTING CANCELED.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
THE CHILDREN'S BOOK PUBLISHER

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
SAYS IT WILL STOP RELEASING SIX

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
OF HIS BOOKS.

04:49.000 --> 04:50.000
>> THE CANCEL CULTURE GOING

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
AFTER DR. SEUSS TONIGHT.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
>> DR. SEUSS BOOKS ARE NOW TOO

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
INSENSITIVE AND EVEN RACIST FOR

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
THIS MOB.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
>> THEY ARE BANNING DR. SEUSS

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
BOOKS.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
HOW MUCH MORE DO YOU NEED TO SEE

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
BEFORE ALL OF AMERICA WAKES UP

05:09.000 --> 05:12.000
AND GOES, "THIS IS FASCISM"?

05:12.000 --> 05:17.000
>> John: OH, I DON'T KNOW,

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
UH, A LOT MORE?

05:18.000 --> 05:19.000
BECAUSE THE BOOKS WEREN'T

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
"BANNED."

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
DR. SEUSS ENTERPRISES DECIDED TO

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
STOP PRINTING SIX OF THEM.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
AND A COMPANY DECIDING WHICH OF

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
ITS OWN BOOKS IT WILL OR WON'T

05:25.000 --> 05:25.000
PRINT IS AN EXAMPLE OF FREE

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
ENTERPRISE, NOT FASCISM.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
IT'D MAKE AS MUCH SENSE TO

05:28.000 --> 05:28.000
ARGUE, "THEY'RE BANNING

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
UNICYCLES.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.000
HOW MUCH MORE DO YOU NEED TO SEE

05:32.000 --> 05:32.000
BEFORE AMERICA WAKES UP AND

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
SAYS, THIS IS

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
TRANSCENDENTALISM?"

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
THE FIRST THING ISN'T EVEN TRUE,

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
AND I'VE GOT NO IDEA HOW YOU GOT

05:38.000 --> 05:40.000
FROM THERE TO THE SECOND PART.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
AND GIVEN HOW STRONGLY ALL THOSE

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
COMMENTATORS WERE DEFENDING

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
THOSE BOOKS, IT'S WORTH KNOWING

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
WHAT, EXACTLY, THEY'RE

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
DEFENDING.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.000
BECAUSE THE IMAGES IN QUESTION

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
INCLUDE THIS OLD-TIMEY

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
CARICATURE OF "A CHINESE MAN

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
WHO EATS WITH STICKS," ACTUALLY

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
TONED DOWN FROM THE ORIGINAL,

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
WHERE HE WAS LITERALLY YELLOW,

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
AND CALLED THIS, AND THERE'S

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
ALSO DRAWINGS THAT RESEMBLE

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
MONKEYS, REPRESENTING PEOPLE

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
FROM AFRICA.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
AND ARE THESE THINGS WE REALLY

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
WANT TO FIGHT FOR KIDS TO SEE?

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
TO BE HONEST, I'M SQUEAMISH

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
ABOUT SHOWING THEM TO YOU RIGHT

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
NOW, AND JUST THREE MINUTES AGO,

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
I WAS HAPPY TO SUBJECT YOU TO

06:12.000 --> 06:15.000
A BASKETBALL ARENA JIZZ STORM.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
THE POINT IS, THESE IMAGES ARE

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
ROUGH, WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY,

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
FOR THE MOST PART, FOX DIDN'T

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
ACTUALLY SHOW THEM.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
INSTEAD, OFTEN FOCUSING ON BOOKS

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
THAT AREN'T EVEN BEING

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
QUESTIONED.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
TUCKER CARLSON FOCUSED A WHOLE

06:26.000 --> 06:28.000
SEGMENT ON "THE SNEETCHES" --

06:28.000 --> 06:29.000
WHICH ISN'T BEING PULLED -- SO

06:29.000 --> 06:30.000
HE COULD PLAY HIS FAVORITE GAME:

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
LIBERALS ARE THE REAL RACISTS.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
>> FOR 60 YEARS, AMERICAN

06:33.000 --> 06:34.000
CHILDREN HAVE READ

06:34.000 --> 06:35.000
"THE SNEETCHES" AND BOOKS

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
LIKE IT, AND THAT'S ONE OF THE

06:37.000 --> 06:38.000
REASONS WE HAVE THE COUNTRY WE

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
HAVE TODAY.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
THE STORY IS A PLEA FOR

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
COLORBLINDNESS, AND THAT'S WHY

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
THE FORCES OF WOKENESS HATE IT

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
AND DR. SEUSS.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
WHEN THE PEOPLE IN CHARGE CANCEL

06:49.000 --> 06:51.000
DR. SEUSS, WHAT THEY'RE REALLY

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
TRYING TO ELIMINATE IS A VERY

06:53.000 --> 06:55.000
SPECIFIC KIND OF MID-CENTURY

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
AMERICAN CULTURE, A CULTURE THAT

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
CHAMPIONED MERITOCRACY AND

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
COLORBLINDNESS.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
>> John: FIRST, SHUT THE FUCK

07:01.000 --> 07:01.000
UP, TUCKER, YOU FEAR-MONGERING

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
LACROSSE INJURY.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
SECOND, IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD TO

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
CLAIM THAT MID-CENTURY AMERICAN

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
CULTURE CHAMPIONED

07:07.000 --> 07:09.000
COLORBLINDNESS WHEN SIGNS

07:09.000 --> 07:10.000
FROM THE TIME EXPLICITLY

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
DEMANDED THE OPPOSITE.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.000
IN FACT, TO THE EXTENT ANYONE IS

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
TRYING TO ELIMINATE SOME PARTS

07:17.000 --> 07:18.000
OF AMERICAN CULTURE, IT'S THE

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
PARTS THAT PERPETUATE RACISM,

07:19.000 --> 07:21.000
XENOPHOBIA, AND BIGOTRY.

07:21.000 --> 07:22.000
BUT IT'S NOT HARD TO SEE WHY

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
TUCKER WOULD BE SO ANXIOUS TO

07:24.000 --> 07:26.000
TALK ABOUT DR. SEUSS THIS WEEK.

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
BECAUSE IF HE'D TALKED ABOUT

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
CHRISTOPHER WRAY'S TESTIMONY

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
ABOUT WHITE SUPREMACISTS

07:31.000 --> 07:32.000
PARTICIPATING IN THE ATTACK

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
ON THE CAPITOL, IT WOULD'VE

07:34.000 --> 07:34.000
CONTRADICTED WHAT HE'S BEEN

07:34.000 --> 07:35.000
TELLING HIS VIEWERS FOR WEEKS

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
NOW, LIKE, "THERE'S NO EVIDENCE

07:36.000 --> 07:38.000
THAT WHITE SUPREMACISTS WERE

07:38.000 --> 07:39.000
RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT HAPPENED

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
ON JANUARY 6TH.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.000
THAT'S A LIE."

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
SO INSTEAD, TUCKER AND

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
CONSERVATIVE MEDIA FELL BACK ON

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
THEIR CLASSIC PLAYBOOK OF

07:46.000 --> 07:47.000
DISTRACTING FROM IMPORTANT

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
IT'S INCREDIBLY LAZY AND

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
DEPRESSINGLY EFFECTIVE.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
AND THE THING IS, NO MATTER HOW

MANY TIMES I SEE THEM DO IT,

IT NEVER FAILS TO LEAVE ME

09:29.000 --> 09:30.000
THE THING THAT WOULD ABSOLUTELY

09:30.000 --> 09:31.000
HAPPEN TO ME IF AT&T EXECUTIVES

09:31.000 --> 09:31.000
EVER FIND OUT WHAT I'VE BEEN

LOOK IT UP ONLINE?

HOW?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
WITH THEIR INTERNET PLAN?

09:37.000 --> 09:37.000
AND THEN CALL SOMEONE?

09:37.000 --> 09:39.000
USING AT&T?

09:39.000 --> 09:40.000
I THINK I'M FINE.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
UNEMPLOYMENT CAN BE A TRAUMATIC

EVENT FOR ANYONE, EVEN PUPPETS.

PINK OIL AND A JAR OF JAM?

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
I SEE YOU, ELMO'S MOM!

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
BUT EVEN FOR THE NON-PUPPET

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
POPULATION, UNEMPLOYMENT IS AN

10:44.000 --> 10:46.000
ESPECIALLY PERTINENT TOPIC RIGHT

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
NOW.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
IT'S BEEN ALMOST EXACTLY A YEAR

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
SINCE THE PANDEMIC HIT, AND TENS

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LOST THEIR

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
JOBS -- MANY OF WHOM FILED FOR

10:53.000 --> 10:55.000
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE, OR

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
"UNEMPLOYMENT."

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
OUR CURRENT SYSTEM WAS CREATED

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
IN THE 1930s.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
AND THE BASIC IDEA WAS, LIKE

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
MOST INSURANCE, TO GATHER FUNDS,

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
PARTICULARLY IN GOOD TIMES, SO

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
THERE'D BE MONEY AVAILABLE TO

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
DISBURSE IN BAD TIMES.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
AND TO PAY FOR ALL OF THIS,

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
STATES WOULD TAX EMPLOYERS.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
THE CONCEPT WAS ENTHUSIASTICALLY

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
PROMOTED AT THE TIME, WITH

11:15.000 --> 11:17.000
EDUCATIONAL FILMS LIKE THIS.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
>> TO SHOW HOW JOB INSURANCE

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
WORKS, LET'S INTRODUCE STEVE,

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
A LOUISIANA WORKER WHO HAS JUST

11:22.000 --> 11:24.000
LOST HIS JOB.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
NOW EACH WEEK, THE LETTER

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
CARRIER BRINGS STEVE A CHECK

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
FOR HALF THE NORMAL WEEKLY WAGE

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
HE USED TO EARN.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
THE MAXIMUM IS $15, THE MINIMUM

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
IS $5, OR THREE-FOURTHS OF HIS

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
EARNINGS.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.000
JOB INSURANCE, THIS IS THE WAY

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
THE STATE OF LOUISIANA IS DOING

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
ITS PART IN THE NATIONWIDE

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
CRUSADE AGAINST UNEMPLOYMENT,

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
FEAR, AND INSECURITY.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
>> John: YES!

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
ATTA BOY, STEVE!

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
THAT NEWSREEL, OF COURSE, FROM

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
THE MAKERS OF SUCH CLASSICS AS

11:50.000 --> 11:52.000
"AMELIA EARHEART: THE WOMAN WHO

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
WILL NEVER DIE," AND "HOW TO

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
FIGHT THE NAZIS EVEN THOUGH,

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
GIVEN THIS ERA'S PREVALENT

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
ANTI-SEMITISM, YOU MOSTLY LIKELY

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
AGREE WITH A LOT OF WHAT THEY'RE

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
SAYING."

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
BUT UNEMPLOYMENT WASN'T JUST

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
CREATED TO SAVE OUR NATION'S

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
STEVES FROM FEAR AND INSECURITY.

12:04.000 --> 12:07.000
ECONOMISTS GENERALLY AGREE THAT

12:07.000 --> 12:08.000
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE IS

12:08.000 --> 12:10.000
ACTUALLY ONE OF THE MOST

12:10.000 --> 12:13.000
EFFECTIVE POLICIES FOR

12:13.000 --> 12:14.000
RECOVERING FROM A RECESSION.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
WHICH MAKES SENSE.

12:16.000 --> 12:16.000
BECAUSE WHEN YOU GIVE THE

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
UNEMPLOYED MONEY, THEY TEND

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
NOT TO HOARD IT OFFSHORE

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
IN THE CAYMANS.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
THEY SPEND IT ON SHIT THEY NEED.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
IN FACT, ANALYSIS FROM PAST

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
RECESSIONS SHOWS, EVERY DOLLAR

12:25.000 --> 12:26.000
SPENT ON UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
BOOSTED ECONOMYWIDE SPENDING BY

12:28.000 --> 12:36.000
AS MUCH AS $2.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
SO IT'S A VITAL SOCIAL SAFETY

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
NET AND HAS MASSIVE

12:40.000 --> 12:41.000
MACROECONOMIC EFFECTS.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
BUT DESPITE THAT, OVER THE

12:42.000 --> 12:43.000
YEARS, OUR SYSTEM HAS BADLY

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
BROKEN DOWN.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.000
SOMETHING THAT BECAME PAINFULLY

12:45.000 --> 12:46.000
CLEAR THIS TIME LAST YEAR WHEN

12:46.000 --> 12:46.000
IT WAS OVERWHELMED BY NEW

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
CLAIMS.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
WE FEATURED STORIES ON THIS SHOW

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
OF PEOPLE HAVING TO CALL

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
50 TIMES A DAY JUST TO MAKE AN

12:51.000 --> 12:52.000
UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIM.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
BUT THAT WAS THE TIP OF THE

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
ICEBERG.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
>> KENTUCKY RESIDENTS POURED

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
INTO THE CAPITAL FOR THEIR FIRST

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
CHANCE TO GET AN IN-PERSON

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
SHE STOOD IN LINE YESTERDAY JUST

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
DAYS AFTER GIVING BIRTH.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.000
>> I MEAN, I'VE CALLED, I'VE

13:11.000 --> 13:12.000
EMAILED.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.000
I DID EVERYTHING I POSSIBLY

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
COULD.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.000
AND STILL, NOTHING.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.000
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.000
WAITING IN LINE FOR UNEMPLOYMENT

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
JUST AFTER GIVING BIRTH IS

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
ALREADY APPALLING.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.000
BUT THE VERY PHRASE "POP-UP

13:25.000 --> 13:28.000
UNEMPLOYMENT OFFICE" IS TRULY

13:28.000 --> 13:28.000
ALARMING.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.000
MUCH LIKE "EMERGENCY

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
CREMATORIUM" OR "ELEPHANT

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
FORCEPS," IT SUGGESTS THINGS

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
HAVE GONE TERRIBLY WRONG AND

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
ARE ABOUT TO GET SIGNIFICANTLY

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
WORSE.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
NOW, SOME OF LAST YEAR'S CHAOS

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
WAS BECAUSE STATES' ANTIQUATED

13:38.000 --> 13:40.000
SYSTEMS WERE SIMPLY OVERWHELMED.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
BUT IT'S A MISTAKE TO THINK OF

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
THIS MERELY AS A TECHNOLOGICAL

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
PROBLEM.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
BECAUSE THE SYSTEM UNDERNEATH

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
THAT SHITTY TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN

13:49.000 --> 13:49.000
BROKEN FOR YEARS NOW, AND

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
SOMETIMES DELIBERATELY.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
A QUICK WAY TO MEASURE THE

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
HEALTH OF A STATE'S SYSTEM IS

13:54.000 --> 13:55.000
THROUGH ITS "RECIPIENCY RATE" --

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
THAT IS BASICALLY, THE

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
PERCENTAGE OF UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
THAT ACTUALLY RECEIVE BENEFITS.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
NOW, IT WILL NEVER BE 100%

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
IN THIS COUNTRY, BECAUSE --

14:03.000 --> 14:05.000
RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY -- NOT

14:05.000 --> 14:06.000
EVERYONE OUT OF WORK IS

14:06.000 --> 14:07.000
ELIGIBLE.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.000
GENERALLY, ONLY THOSE WHO ARE

14:08.000 --> 14:11.000
LAID OFF ARE.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
AND THAT IS JUST OVER

14:12.000 --> 14:13.000
HALF THE UNEMPLOYED.

14:13.000 --> 14:14.000
THE REST -- LIKE THOSE FRESH

14:14.000 --> 14:15.000
OUT OF SCHOOL, OR WHO QUIT

14:15.000 --> 14:16.000
VOLUNTARILY, OR WHO WERE

14:16.000 --> 14:17.000
FIRED -- ARE GENERALLY NOT

14:17.000 --> 14:18.000
COVERED.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.000
THAT IS WHY, EXPERTS SAY THAT

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
UNDER OUR CURRENT SYSTEM,

14:20.000 --> 14:21.000
A GOOD RULE OF THUMB IS THAT

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
A STATE'S RECIPIENCY RATE SHOULD

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
BE AROUND 50%.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
THE PROBLEM IS, NATIONALLY,

14:27.000 --> 14:28.000
EVEN BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC,

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
WE WERE AT JUST 28%.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.000
AND IN SOME STATES,

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
LIKE NORTH CAROLINA AND FLORIDA,

14:33.000 --> 14:35.000
IT WAS AROUND 10%!

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
JUST THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT

14:37.000 --> 14:38.000
MEANS: OUT OF EVERY TEN

14:38.000 --> 14:40.000
UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE IN THOSE

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
STATES, ONLY ONE IS ACTUALLY

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
RECEIVING BENEFITS.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.000
IF YOU BOARDED AN AIRPLANE AND

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
LEARNED THAT ONLY ONE IN TEN

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
SEATS HAD AN OXYGEN MASK,

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
YOU'D WONDER "WHO DESIGNED THIS

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
SYSTEM?," "WHY DID THEY MAKE IT

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
THIS WAY?"

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
AND "HOW DO I GET OUT OF HERE

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
RIGHT FUCKING NOW?"

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
SO GIVEN THAT, TONIGHT, LET'S

14:58.000 --> 14:59.000
LOOK AT OUR CURRENT UNEMPLOYMENT

14:59.000 --> 15:00.000
SYSTEM.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
AND THE FIRST THING TO KNOW IS,

15:02.000 --> 15:03.000
IT IS NOT ONE SYSTEM.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
FROM THE VERY START, STATES WERE

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
GIVEN HUGE LATITUDE IN RUNNING

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
MEANING WE ESSENTIALLY HAVE

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
53 COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SYSTEMS,

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
ONE FOR EACH STATE, PLUS D.C.,

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
PUERTO RICO, AND

15:14.000 --> 15:15.000
THE VIRGIN ISLANDS.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
AND NOT ONLY IS THAT

15:17.000 --> 15:18.000
INEFFICIENT, IT MEANS THE LEVEL

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
OF BENEFITS VARY WILDLY.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.000
>> MASSACHUSETTS PAYS THE MOST,

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
UP TO $1234 A WEEK.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
FLORIDA'S MAXIMUM?

15:26.000 --> 15:28.000
$275 A WEEK.

15:28.000 --> 15:30.000
>> John: THAT IS A HELL OF

15:30.000 --> 15:31.000
A DIFFERENCE.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
IT'S SOMETHING PEOPLE MIGHT WANT

15:32.000 --> 15:33.000
TO FACTOR IN IF THEY'RE

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
CONSIDERING MOVING SOMEWHERE.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
"WELL, THE CLIMATE SEEMS NICER,

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
AND THE SCHOOLS SEEM DECENT --

15:38.000 --> 15:40.000
BEFORE I GO, LET ME JUST GOOGLE,

15:40.000 --> 15:42.000
IF I LOSE MY JOB, WILL THIS

15:42.000 --> 15:44.000
STATE LET ME STARVE?"

15:44.000 --> 15:45.000
AND IT'S NOT JUST WHERE YOU LIVE

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
THAT DETERMINES YOUR BENEFITS.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
IT ALSO MATTERS WHAT YOU DO.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.000
BECAUSE MANY PART-TIME WORKERS,

15:50.000 --> 15:51.000
PLUS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
GIG WORKERS TYPICALLY DON'T

15:53.000 --> 15:59.000
QUALIFY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.000
WHICH IS ABSURD, GIVEN THAT

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
THOSE JOBS MAKE UP A SIGNIFICANT

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
PORTION OF OUR MODERN WORKFORCE.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.000
AND INCIDENTALLY, BLACK WORKERS

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
ARE OVERREPRESENTED IN THOSE

16:06.000 --> 16:07.000
TYPES OF JOBS, JUST AS THEY'RE

16:07.000 --> 16:08.000
OVERREPRESENTED IN THE STATES

16:08.000 --> 16:12.000
WITH THE LEAST-GENEROUS

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
BENEFITS, WHICH MIGHT EXPLAIN

16:14.000 --> 16:16.000
WHY BLACK WORKERS ARE MORE

16:16.000 --> 16:17.000
LIKELY TO BE UNEMPLOYED, BUT

16:18.000 --> 16:18.000
LESS LIKELY TO GET UNEMPLOYMENT

16:18.000 --> 16:19.000
BENEFITS.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
AND INEQUITY WAS BAKED INTO

16:21.000 --> 16:22.000
THE SYSTEM FROM THE VERY

16:22.000 --> 16:23.000
BEGINNING.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
IN THE 1930s, AGRICULTURAL AND

16:24.000 --> 16:24.000
DOMESTIC WORKERS WERE INITIALLY

16:24.000 --> 16:26.000
PURPOSELY EXCLUDED, MEANING THAT

16:26.000 --> 16:28.000
65% OF BLACK WORKERS WEREN'T

16:28.000 --> 16:31.000
COVERED BY THE PROGRAM.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.000
IT SEEMS IN THE U.S., YOU CAN

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
BASICALLY POINT TO ANYTHING,

16:34.000 --> 16:35.000
ASK "HOW IS THAT RACIST," AND

16:35.000 --> 16:35.000
GET A SPECIFIC, HISTORICAL

16:35.000 --> 16:36.000
ANSWER.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.000
FREEWAYS?

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
DEMOLISHED BLACK COMMUNITIES.

16:39.000 --> 16:40.000
MICKEY MOUSE?

16:40.000 --> 16:41.000
BASED ON MINSTREL SHOWS.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
THIS TODDLER?

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
WELL, HIS NAME IS KENDALL,

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
SO IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
THE POINT IS, IN MANY STATES,

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
FOR MYRIAD REASONS, YOU MAY NOT

16:50.000 --> 16:52.000
BE ABLE TO GET UNEMPLOYMENT,

16:53.000 --> 16:54.000
AND EVEN IF YOU DO, IT MAY NOT

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
BE ENOUGH TO LIVE ON.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
THAT IS SOMETHING THE FEDERAL

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
GOVERNMENT SEEMED TO ACKNOWLEDGE

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
WAS A PROBLEM LAST YEAR, WHEN

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
IT SUDDENLY TEMPORARILY EXPANDED

17:02.000 --> 17:03.000
UNEMPLOYMENT TO COVER MORE

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
WORKERS, AND BOOSTED BENEFITS

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
BY $600 ACROSS THE BOARD.

17:08.000 --> 17:09.000
SO HOW DID OUR SYSTEM GET THIS

17:10.000 --> 17:11.000
SHITTY?

17:12.000 --> 17:12.000
AND WHOSE FAULT IS IT?

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
IS IT ELMO'S?

17:14.000 --> 17:15.000
THE ANSWER'S NOT DEFINITELY "NO"

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
YET.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
BUT THE TRUTH IS, A LOT OF THE

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
SYSTEM'S SHORTCOMINGS WERE THE

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
RESULT OF DELIBERATE CHOICES.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
FOR ONE, REMEMBER, BUSINESSES

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
FUND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE,

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
THROUGH TAXES THAT GO INTO

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
STATE TRUST FUNDS.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.000
AND AFTER THE LAST FINANCIAL

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
CRISIS DRAINED THOSE FUNDS,

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
STATES NEEDED TO RESTORE THEM.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
BUT RATHER THAN DO THE SENSIBLE

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
THING -- RAISE TAXES TO GET MORE

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
MONEY COMING IN -- MANY OPTED TO

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
INSTEAD JUST CUT BENEFITS AND

17:40.000 --> 17:41.000
MAKE THEM HARDER TO GET.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
AND AS THEY DID THIS, SOME IN

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
THE NATIONAL MEDIA CHEERED THEM

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
ON, LIKE SENTIENT PLANTATION

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
WEDDING, LAURA INGRAHAM.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.000
>> IT'S SIMPLE HUMAN NATURE THAT

17:50.000 --> 17:51.000
PEOPLE ARE A LITTLE LESS

17:51.000 --> 17:52.000
MOTIVATED AS LONG AS THERE'S

17:52.000 --> 17:53.000
A CHECK COMING IN.

17:53.000 --> 17:56.000
YOU KNOW WHAT MY MOM USED TO

17:56.000 --> 17:57.000
SAY -- GOD REST HER SOUL -- WHEN

17:57.000 --> 17:58.000
YOU'RE HUNGRY, YOU'LL FIGURE OUT

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
A WAY TO EAT.

18:00.000 --> 18:04.000
RIGHT?

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
HUNGER BRINGS DRIVE, HUNGER

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
FOR OPPORTUNITY, HUNGER

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
FOR A PAYCHECK, HUNGER FOR

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
ACTUAL FOOD, HUNGER FOR A

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
LIFESTYLE, A WAY OF LIFE.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
BOY, YOU FIND IT WHEN THERE'S

18:16.000 --> 18:16.000
NO HELPING HAND.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.000
>> John: WOW.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
"WHEN YOU'RE HUNGRY, YOU'LL

18:20.000 --> 18:25.000
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO EAT."

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
WELL, SOMETIMES, LAURA.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
THE PROBLEM IS, SOMETIMES NOT!

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
AND THEN IT'S A TRAGEDY.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
THERE'S A REASON THAT FAMINES

18:32.000 --> 18:33.000
AREN'T GENERALLY REFERRED TO AS

18:33.000 --> 18:34.000
"A LACK OF CAN-DO ATTITUDE."

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
AND THAT KIND OF RHETORIC

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
HAS BECOME PRETTY POPULAR.

18:37.000 --> 18:37.000
YOUR MOST RACIST UNCLE HAS

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
UNDOUBTEDLY SAID SOMETHING

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
SIMILAR, PROBABLY TO A WAITRESS

18:39.000 --> 18:40.000
AT RED LOBSTER, COMPLETELY

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
RUINING MOTHER'S DAY.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.000
AND THAT SPEAKS TO THE KIND OF

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
ATTITUDES TOWARD THE

18:45.000 --> 18:46.000
UNEMPLOYED -- RANGING FROM

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
SIMMERING CONTEMPT TO A CALLOUS

18:48.000 --> 18:49.000
DISREGARD -- THAT LIE BENEATH

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
MANY STATES' AGGRESSIVE POLICY

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
CHANGES OVER THE PAST DECADE.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
STARTING IN 2012, TENNESSEE

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
PASSED LAWS MAKING THE PROCESS

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
TO APPLY FAR MORE DIFFICULT.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
ONE JUSTIFICATION BEING THAT

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
SOMEHOW, LOADS OF PEOPLE

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
INELIGIBLE FOR BENEFITS WERE

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
STILL GETTING THEM.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.000
WHICH IS NONSENSE, BUT SOMETHING

19:07.000 --> 19:08.000
THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR BACK

19:08.000 --> 19:09.000
THEN, RON RAMSEY, CERTAINLY

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
BELIEVED.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
>> IF YOU WERE FIRED FROM YOUR

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
JOB FOR JUST CAUSE, MAYBE EVEN

19:14.000 --> 19:15.000
FOR STEALING FROM YOUR EMPLOYER

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
OR CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM, YOU

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO DRAW

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
UNEMPLOYMENT.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
>> YOU DON'T GET UNEMPLOYMENT

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
INSURANCE IF YOU'RE FIRED WITH

19:20.000 --> 19:21.000
CAUSE NOW.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
>> THE LAW SAYS THEY'RE NOT

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
SUPPOSED TO, BUT, BUDDY, LET ME

19:25.000 --> 19:26.000
ASSURE YOU, NINE TIMES OUT OF

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
TEN, THEY GET THEIR WORKERS

19:27.000 --> 19:28.000
COMP, OR THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.000
I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT'S

19:29.000 --> 19:29.000
THE CASE.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.000
>> NINE TIMES OUT OF TEN?

19:30.000 --> 19:31.000
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT,

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
OKAY.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.000
THAT WAS -- THAT WAS A

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
RON RAMSEY BLANKET STATEMENT

19:34.000 --> 19:37.000
THERE, BUT THERE ARE PLENTY OF

19:37.000 --> 19:38.000
EXAMPLES THAT THEY GET IT.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
>> John: OH, YEAH!

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
DON'T WORRY -- THAT'S JUST

19:41.000 --> 19:41.000
A CLASSIC RON RAMSEY BLANKET

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
STATEMENT.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
AND YOU KNOW YOU'RE IN GOOD

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
HANDS WHEN A GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
LIES ENOUGH TO WARRANT

19:48.000 --> 19:49.000
A FUCKING TRADEMARK.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.000
NOW RAMSEY ALSO ARGUED FOR

19:51.000 --> 19:52.000
DRUG-TESTING THE UNEMPLOYED,

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
SAYING, I DON'T THINK WE NEED

19:54.000 --> 19:54.000
TO BE SUPPORTING THAT LIFESTYLE

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
WITH GOVERNMENT MONEY.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
WHICH IS NOT JUST AN OBVIOUS

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
ATTEMPT TO STIGMATIZE, IT ALSO

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
IGNORES THAT DRUGS ARE ACTUALLY

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
HELPFUL IN SOME JOBS.

20:05.000 --> 20:06.000
LIKE, FOR INSTANCE, THIS ONE.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.000
HOW DO YOU THINK I TALK THIS

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
FAST ABOUT THINGS THIS

20:08.000 --> 20:09.000
DEPRESSING?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
WHAT DO YOU EVEN THINK THIS

20:10.000 --> 20:10.000
WHITE VOID IS MADE OUT OF?

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
I'M SURROUNDED BY WEAPONS-GRADE

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
COCAINE.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.000
AND IT WASN'T JUST TENNESSEE --

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
LOTS OF STATES PUT IN NEW,

20:18.000 --> 20:19.000
ONEROUS REQUIREMENTS, TO MAKE

20:19.000 --> 20:20.000
SURE THAT PEOPLE GETTING

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
BENEFITS "DESERVED" THEM.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
FOR INSTANCE, NEBRASKA STARTED

20:24.000 --> 20:25.000
REQUIRING FIVE "WORK SEARCH"

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
ACTIVITIES PER WEEK, WHICH COULD

20:27.000 --> 20:28.000
INCLUDE ATTENDING A RESUME

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
WRITING CLASS OR TAKING

20:30.000 --> 20:31.000
A CIVIL SERVICE EXAM,

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
BUT AT LEAST TWO OF WHICH

20:32.000 --> 20:33.000
HAD TO BE APPLICATIONS FOR

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
SUITABLE WORK.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
BUT IF THERE AREN'T TWO SUITABLE

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
WORK OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOU TO

20:38.000 --> 20:39.000
APPLY FOR THAT WEEK, YOU'RE SHIT

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
OUT OF LUCK.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.000
AND THE PROBLEM IS, EACH

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT LIKE THAT

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
INCREASES THE CHANCES THAT

20:45.000 --> 20:46.000
SOMEONE'S GOING TO MAKE A

20:46.000 --> 20:47.000
MISTAKE, OR FAIL TO CHECK A BOX,

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
AND GET DENIED BENEFITS THEY

20:49.000 --> 20:50.000
NEED.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.000
AND AS THEY WERE DOING THIS,

20:52.000 --> 20:52.000
STATES WERE ALSO AGGRESSIVELY

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
TARGETING FRAUD.

20:54.000 --> 20:54.000
WHICH ISN'T, IN ITSELF,

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
A BAD IDEA.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
STATES DO LOSE MONEY TO FRAUD.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
BEFORE THE PANDEMIC HIT, IT

21:00.000 --> 21:01.000
WASN'T A LOT -- AN AVERAGE OF

21:01.000 --> 21:02.000
3%.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
BUT THAT ACTUALLY SURGED LAST

21:04.000 --> 21:07.000
YEAR, WHEN ORGANIZED CRIMINALS

21:07.000 --> 21:08.000
TARGETED UNEMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS,

21:08.000 --> 21:10.000
AND CALIFORNIA ALONE SAID IT

21:10.000 --> 21:17.000
LOST $11 BILLION.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.000
BUT THE THING IS,

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
YOU HAVE TO BE VERY PRECISE

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
IN HOW YOU GO AFTER FRAUD.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
BECAUSE IF A CLAIM IS WRONGLY

21:22.000 --> 21:24.000
FLAGGED, IT CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY

21:24.000 --> 21:24.000
DELAYED, AND INNOCENT PEOPLE

21:24.000 --> 21:26.000
THEN GET HURT.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.000
THAT IS SOMETHING KENTUCKY'S

21:28.000 --> 21:28.000
GOVERNOR RECENTLY FOUND WHEN HE

21:28.000 --> 21:29.000
SHARED WHAT HE CLEARLY THOUGHT

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
WAS A PRETTY FLAGRANT EXAMPLE.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.000
>> WE HAD SOMEONE APPLY FOR

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
UNEMPLOYMENT FOR TUPAC SHAKUR

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
HERE IN KENTUCKY.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
AND THAT PERSON PROBABLY THOUGHT

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
THEY WERE BEING FUNNY.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.000
THEY PROBABLY DID.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.000
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT,

21:39.000 --> 21:41.000
BECAUSE OF THEM, WE'VE GOTTA GO

21:41.000 --> 21:42.000
THROUGH SO MANY OTHER CLAIMS.

21:42.000 --> 21:47.000
>> John: OKAY.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.000
HE MADE A VERY CONFIDENT,

21:48.000 --> 21:49.000
PUBLIC EXAMPLE OF

21:49.000 --> 21:49.000
THAT, BECAUSE HE KNEW: NO ONE

21:49.000 --> 21:50.000
COULD BE CALLED TUPAC SHAKUR,

21:50.000 --> 21:52.000
RIGHT?

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
THAT IS JUST NOT A NAME PEOPLE

21:53.000 --> 21:53.000
HAVE.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.000
EXCEPT, OF COURSE, FAMOUSLY,

21:54.000 --> 21:55.000
THIS GUY BUT WE ALL KNOW, HE'S

21:55.000 --> 21:56.000
LIVING IN THE FALKLAND ISLANDS

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
RIGHT NOW.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
NO ONE ELSE COULD HAVE THAT

21:58.000 --> 22:00.000
NAME.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.000
IT'S ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE.

22:02.000 --> 22:02.000
I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT'S COMING

22:02.000 --> 22:03.000
NEXT.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
>> I OWE SOMEBODY AN APOLOGY

22:05.000 --> 22:08.000
TONIGHT.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
LAST NIGHT, I SPENT A LITTLE BIT

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
OF TIME TALKING ABOUT FRAUDULENT

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
CLAIMS HOLDING US UP.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
I MENTIONED AN INDIVIDUAL WHO

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
FILED IN THE NAME OF

22:17.000 --> 22:18.000
TUPAC SHAKUR.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
I DIDN'T KNOW, AND IT'S MY

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
FAULT, THAT WE HAVE A KENTUCKIAN

22:23.000 --> 22:25.000
WHO GOES BY MALIK, WHOSE NAME IS

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
TUPAC SHAKUR.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
I TALKED TO HIM ON THE PHONE

22:29.000 --> 22:30.000
TODAY, I APOLOGIZED.

22:30.000 --> 22:36.000
>> John: YEAH, I BET YOU DID.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
AND I WILL SAY, THAT'S YET

22:38.000 --> 22:38.000
ANOTHER EXAMPLE THAT NOTHING

22:38.000 --> 22:39.000
GOOD CAN EVER COME FROM

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
A MIDDLE-AGED WHITE MAN KNOWING

22:40.000 --> 22:41.000
ANYTHING ABOUT RAP.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
PERIOD.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
WE JUST CAN'T HANDLE IT.

22:43.000 --> 22:48.000
THAT'S HOW YOU GET MACKLEMORE.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.000
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING, "HEY,

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
WHAT'S SO BAD ABOUT

22:52.000 --> 22:52.000
MACKLEMORE?,"

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
YOU'RE VERY MUCH PART OF

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
THE PROBLEM HERE.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
AND SOME MISTAKES HAPPENED

22:55.000 --> 22:56.000
ON A MUCH BIGGER SCALE.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
MICHIGAN ROLLED OUT A NEW SYSTEM

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
IN 2013, WHICH FLAGGED TENS OF

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
THOUSANDS OF CASES FOR FRAUD.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
UNFORTUNATELY, A REVIEW

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
FOUR YEARS LATER FOUND IT HAD

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
A 70% ERROR RATE.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
MEANING THEY'D FALSELY ACCUSED

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
MORE THAN 40,000 PEOPLE OF

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
FRAUDULENTLY CLAIMING BENEFITS,

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
AND HAD BEEN WRONGFULLY

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
RECOUPING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
MONEY FROM MANY OF THEM.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
AND THE PROBLEM WITH THE WORD

23:14.000 --> 23:17.000
"RECOUP" THERE IS, IT SOUNDS

23:17.000 --> 23:19.000
KIND OF BLOODLESS, UNTIL YOU

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
REALIZE THAT THOSE PEOPLE WERE

23:20.000 --> 23:21.000
REQUIRED TO REPAY THEIR BENEFITS

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
AT A 400% PENALTY.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
WHICH IS JUST BRUTAL.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
IT'S LIKE A HOSPITAL MISTAKENLY

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
THINKING A PATIENT WROTE A BAD

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
CHECK, AND DECIDING TO "RECOUP"

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
THEIR FUCKING HIP REPLACEMENT.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.000
HEY!

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG, AND

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
I REALLY NEEDED THAT!

23:36.000 --> 23:37.000
AND IF YOU WANT TO SEE HOW ALL

23:38.000 --> 23:39.000
OF THIS -- POOR TECHNOLOGY, DEEP

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
BENEFIT CUTS, AND ABSURD

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS -- CAN

23:43.000 --> 23:44.000
COME TOGETHER TO BREAK A VITAL

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
SOCIAL PROGRAM, LOOK NO FURTHER

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
THAN FLORIDA.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
AMERICA'S VESTIGIAL TAIL.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
FLORIDA'S PREVIOUS GOVERNOR,

23:53.000 --> 23:54.000
AND SLENDERMAN UNDERSTUDY

23:54.000 --> 23:56.000
RICK SCOTT, TOOK A HATCHET

23:56.000 --> 23:57.000
TO THE STATE'S PROGRAM

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
WHILE IN POWER.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.000
WHEN HE WAS SWORN IN, EMPLOYERS

23:59.000 --> 24:00.000
THAT YEAR PAID AN AVERAGE OF

24:00.000 --> 24:02.000
$319 PER EMPLOYEE IN

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
UNEMPLOYMENT TAXES.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.000
BY THE TIME HE LEFT OFFICE,

24:05.000 --> 24:07.000
THEY WERE PAYING JUST $50 PER

24:07.000 --> 24:09.000
EMPLOYEE -- THE LOWEST IN THE

24:09.000 --> 24:10.000
COUNTRY, AND LESS THAN ONE-FIFTH

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
THE NATIONAL AVERAGE.

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
AND TO BALANCE THOSE CUTS OUT --

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
AS SCOTT PROUDLY TOLD A

24:15.000 --> 24:18.000
CONFERENCE OF YOUNG REPUBLICANS

24:18.000 --> 24:19.000
IN 2019 -- HE FOUND WAYS TO KEEP

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
A LOT OF FLORIDIANS OFF

24:21.000 --> 24:22.000
UNEMPLOYMENT.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.000
>> ABOUT 22 MILLION PEOPLE LIVE

24:23.000 --> 24:27.000
IN FLORIDA.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
HOW MANY PEOPLE TODAY, THROW OUT

24:29.000 --> 24:30.000
A GUESS, HOW MANY PEOPLE WHEN I

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
LEFT OFFICE WERE ON UNEMPLOYMENT

24:32.000 --> 24:33.000
BENEFITS?

24:33.000 --> 24:36.000
TEN MILLION IS ONE.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
ANYBODY ELSE?

24:38.000 --> 24:46.000
61,000.

24:46.000 --> 24:47.000
[SCATTERED APPLAUSE]

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
>> John: WOW, THAT IS SOME

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
NERVOUS APPLAUSE.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
EVEN IN THAT ROOM, YOU CAN FEEL

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
PEOPLE THINKING, "WAIT, 61,000?

24:53.000 --> 24:55.000
OUT OF 22 MILLION?

24:56.000 --> 24:57.000
OH, THAT FEELS WAY TOO LOW.

24:57.000 --> 25:00.000
IS WHAT HE DID TERRIBLE?

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
ARE WE ALL TERRIBLE?

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
AW, NEVER MIND, WE'RE

25:03.000 --> 25:06.000
CLAPPING NOW.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
OKAY, I DO FEEL BETTER WHEN WE

25:08.000 --> 25:09.000
CLAP."

25:09.000 --> 25:10.000
TO ACHIEVE THOSE NUMBERS, SCOTT

25:10.000 --> 25:11.000
EMPLOYED ALL THE TACTICS YOU'VE

25:11.000 --> 25:12.000
SEEN.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
HE STARTED REQUIRING PEOPLE

25:14.000 --> 25:14.000
DOCUMENT CONTACTS WITH FIVE

25:14.000 --> 25:16.000
EMPLOYERS PER WEEK, REDUCED

25:16.000 --> 25:17.000
TOTAL BENEFITS BY SLASHING

25:17.000 --> 25:17.000
THE NUMBER OF WEEKS YOU COULD

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
RECEIVE THEM, AND THREW IN SOME

25:19.000 --> 25:20.000
EXTRA OBSTACLES, LIKE REQUIRING

25:20.000 --> 25:21.000
APPLICANTS TO COMPLETE A

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
45-QUESTION "SKILLS ASSESSMENT,"

25:23.000 --> 25:24.000
TESTING THEIR READING, MATH, AND

25:24.000 --> 25:27.000
RESEARCH SKILLS -- A POLICY SO

25:28.000 --> 25:28.000
CLEARLY MEANT TO IMPEDE ACCESS,

25:28.000 --> 25:29.000
THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR'S

25:29.000 --> 25:30.000
CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION DETERMINED

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
IT VIOLATED FEDERAL

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
NONDISCRIMINATION LAW.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
THE STATE ALSO FORCED EVERYONE

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
TO FILE ONLINE, AND ROLLED OUT

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
AN EXPENSIVE NEW CLAIMS SYSTEM,

25:38.000 --> 25:39.000
WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY PLAGUED

25:39.000 --> 25:40.000
WITH GLITCHES.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
AND DESPITE ALL OF HIS

25:42.000 --> 25:45.000
REASSURANCES AT THE TIME THAT

25:45.000 --> 25:46.000
THEY'D BE FIXED, THEY CLEARLY

25:46.000 --> 25:49.000
WEREN'T, BECAUSE THE SYSTEM

25:49.000 --> 25:50.000
CRASHED SO BADLY LAST YEAR, THEY

25:50.000 --> 25:51.000
HAD TO SUDDENLY SHIFT TO PAPER

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
APPLICATIONS -- WHICH, IN THE

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC, BROUGHT A

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
WHOLE DIFFERENT SET OF PROBLEMS.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
>> IT WAS NEAR BEDLAM AT THE

25:58.000 --> 25:59.000
JOHN F. KENNEDY LIBRARY IN

25:59.000 --> 26:00.000
HIALEAH.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
A CROWD IN UNCOMFORTABLY CLOSE

26:02.000 --> 26:03.000
QUARTERS SHOVED ITS WAY FORWARD

26:03.000 --> 26:05.000
WITH PEOPLE DESPERATE TO GET

26:05.000 --> 26:07.000
THEIR HANDS ON ONE OF THESE,

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
AN APPLICATION FOR UNEMPLOYMENT

26:08.000 --> 26:09.000
BENEFITS.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.000
>> I AM SO SCARED.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.000
I'M SCARED FOR MY LIFE.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.000
JUST FOR AN APPLICATION.

26:16.000 --> 26:17.000
>> John: YEAH, I'M SCARED FOR

26:17.000 --> 26:18.000
YOUR LIFE, TOO, JUST WATCHING

26:18.000 --> 26:19.000
THAT.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
AND IT'S A TESTAMENT TO BOTH

26:21.000 --> 26:22.000
THIS PANDEMIC AND FLORIDA'S

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
RIDICULOUS SYSTEM THAT I FEEL

26:23.000 --> 26:24.000
THE SAME WHITE-KNUCKLE TERROR

26:31.000 --> 26:32.000

26:32.000 --> 26:33.000
ALTHOUGH, TO BE HONEST, IT'S

26:33.000 --> 26:34.000

26:34.000 --> 26:35.000

26:35.000 --> 26:37.000

26:37.000 --> 26:39.000
UNEMPLOYMENT THERE, TOO.

26:39.000 --> 26:41.000
AND WHILE YOU COULD ARGUE THAT

26:41.000 --> 26:42.000
THIS WAS JUST INCOMPETENCE,

26:42.000 --> 26:43.000
YOU COULD ALSO ARGUE IT WAS

26:44.000 --> 26:45.000
COMPLETELY DELIBERATE.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.000

26:46.000 --> 26:48.000

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000

26:51.000 --> 26:52.000

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
ROADBLOCKS ALONG THE WAY SO

26:57.000 --> 26:58.000

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
WITH IT.

26:59.000 --> 27:01.000
I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT."

27:01.000 --> 27:02.000

27:02.000 --> 27:04.000

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
CONSTRUCTED, YOU KNOW, IT WAS

27:06.000 --> 27:07.000
DEFINITELY DONE IN A WAY TO LEAD

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000

27:09.000 --> 27:09.000

27:14.000 --> 27:15.000

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000

27:18.000 --> 27:19.000

27:19.000 --> 27:20.000

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000

27:22.000 --> 27:23.000

27:23.000 --> 27:24.000

27:25.000 --> 27:28.000
FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED MESSENGER.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.000
BECAUSE BEFORE YOU GIVE DESANTIS

27:30.000 --> 27:31.000

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
WORTH KNOWING A STATE

27:32.000 --> 27:33.000

27:33.000 --> 27:35.000

27:35.000 --> 27:39.000

27:46.000 --> 27:47.000

28:23.000 --> 28:25.000

28:25.000 --> 28:26.000
AND THE INFURIATING THING IS HOW

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
COMPLETELY PREVENTABLE IT IS.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.000
WE COULD HELP HER.

28:29.000 --> 28:31.000
IT'D BE BETTER FOR HER.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.000
IT'D ACTUALLY BE BETTER

28:32.000 --> 28:34.000
FOR THE BROADER ECONOMY.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.000
AND YET WE'RE ACTIVELY CHOOSING

28:35.000 --> 28:41.000
NOT TO DO IT.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.000
WHICH IS A FUCKING DISGRACE.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.000
SO HOW CAN WE FIX THIS SHIT

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
GOING FORWARD?

28:44.000 --> 28:45.000
WELL, FIRST, THERE CAN NO LONGER

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
BE ANY ARGUMENT THAT OUR CURRENT

28:46.000 --> 28:47.000
SYSTEM IS BROKEN.

28:47.000 --> 28:48.000
AGAIN, THE GOVERNMENT'S ACTIONS

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
LAST YEAR -- RAISING PAYMENTS,

28:50.000 --> 28:51.000
AND SCRAMBLING TO MAKE SURE THE

28:51.000 --> 28:53.000
SYSTEM COVERED MORE WORKERS --

28:53.000 --> 28:55.000
IS A PRETTY PUBLIC ADMISSION

28:55.000 --> 28:57.000
THAT IT WAS FUCKED.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
SO NOW YOU'VE GOT TO FIX IT.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
IN THE VERY SHORT TERM, STATES

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
NEED FUNDING TO UPGRADE THEIR

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
BROKEN TECHNOLOGY.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.000
THEY ALSO NEED TO REMOVE A LOT

29:04.000 --> 29:06.000
OF THE STUPID OBSTACLES THAT

29:06.000 --> 29:07.000
PREVENT APPLICANTS WHO NEED HELP

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
FROM GETTING IT.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.000
BUT IN THE LONG TERM, WE NEED

29:11.000 --> 29:13.000
SOME BIG CHANGES.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.000
MANY EXPERTS AGREE, IF THE U.S.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
GOT A DO-OVER, IT'D BE MUCH

29:16.000 --> 29:18.000
BETTER TO GO WITH ONE FEDERAL

29:18.000 --> 29:20.000
SYSTEM THAN 53 SEPARATE ONES.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.000
SO WE SHOULD PROBABLY DO THAT.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT WOULD

29:24.000 --> 29:25.000
STOP STATES FROM BEING ABLE TO

29:26.000 --> 29:27.000
SLASH THEIR PROGRAMS IN THE NAME

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
OF BEING "PRO-BUSINESS," AND
