WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:03.235
<i>[man] We'd like to congratulate
Russell Cartwright</i>

00:03.270 --> 00:05.205
<i>on being this year's
grant recipient.</i>

00:05.239 --> 00:08.108
Rusty? It's Dana.
We met at orientation.

00:08.141 --> 00:09.876
Did you know that
I've had a crush on you
since we met?

00:09.910 --> 00:12.145
I liked you even when
you were the Anchor.

00:12.179 --> 00:14.114
Maybe I could buy you
a cup of coffee?

00:15.950 --> 00:18.585
Are you freaking
kidding me? You bl.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.720
There's nothing you can say.
We were all friends again.

00:20.755 --> 00:23.023
- Why did you have
to screw it up?
- You screwed it up

00:23.057 --> 00:24.891
<i>by getti back
together with Cappie.</i>

00:24.925 --> 00:28.228
I'm not going to apologize
for doing what I had to do
for my house.

00:28.262 --> 00:30.497
My house would
never ask me to screw
with people's lives.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.832
No, you're just
a bunch of losers
while the rest of us,

00:32.867 --> 00:35.335
including your girlfriend,
have real lives.

00:35.369 --> 00:38.171
When am I supposed to compromise
what I want for a relationship?

00:38.205 --> 00:40.740
[sighs] This is gonna be
trickier than I thought.

00:43.310 --> 00:45.178
Thanks for breakfast, Cap.

00:45.212 --> 00:48.348
- Who says guys can't cook?
- Oh, wow. This is amazing!

00:48.382 --> 00:51.251
Oh, yeah, it's just
this little something
I threw together

00:51.285 --> 00:53.420
called Fruity Cocoa
Cinnamon Sugar Frosted

00:53.454 --> 00:56.523
Honey Marshmallow
Berry Waffle Pops
with Clusters.

00:56.557 --> 00:59.526
I was talking about this
article on Paula Baker's bill
limiting carbon emissions.

00:59.560 --> 01:02.328
- I worked on that bill as
an intern at her office.
- "Worked on"?

01:02.363 --> 01:04.197
OK, I made copies of it,

01:04.230 --> 01:06.266
but something I was a part of
is actually going

01:06.300 --> 01:08.902
to the President of the
United States to become a law!

01:10.337 --> 01:12.906
I painted flames on my turtle.

01:12.940 --> 01:15.208
- That's pretty.
- He's not supposed
to be pretty.

01:15.242 --> 01:18.478
He's supposed to be
awesome and intimidating.

01:18.512 --> 01:22.715
Aren't you, Little
Earnhardt, Junior...

01:22.750 --> 01:24.250
Jr.

01:24.285 --> 01:28.555
The KT 500 is about to begin.
Turtles, to your starting gates!

01:30.491 --> 01:33.159
I glued nunchucks on mine
and named him Michelangelo.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.995
Yeah? Well, we're gonna kick
your Teenage Mutant Ninja ass.

01:36.030 --> 01:39.699
- [indistinct shouting]
- It'd be so awesome to be there

01:39.733 --> 01:42.102
and be a part of the
process, making laws.

01:42.136 --> 01:46.439
You know, I thought you had
a bad time in Washington.

01:46.474 --> 01:49.175
Fetching coffee,
making copies. They
called you Elle Woods.

01:49.210 --> 01:51.177
Yes, I remember, thank you.

01:51.212 --> 01:53.446
But just because some people
in Paula's office

01:53.481 --> 01:55.915
saw me as a vapid sorority girl
doesn't mean I should give up.

01:55.950 --> 01:58.451
It means I have to work harder
to prove that's not me.

01:58.486 --> 02:00.720
Good for you. You know
who else won't give up?

02:01.589 --> 02:03.790
Little Earnhardt Junior, Jr.

02:04.925 --> 02:07.861
I need to focus on my future.

02:07.895 --> 02:11.397
I mean, graduation's coming up
and then... and then...

02:15.903 --> 02:17.704
I think the turtle race
is about to start.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.305
- Don't wanna miss
that green flag.
- Uh-uh.

02:21.775 --> 02:24.511
[cheering and yelling]

02:26.000 --> 02:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:43.164 --> 02:45.965
Sweet Mother of Mary
Elizabeth Mastrantonio,

02:46.000 --> 02:48.635
is that the new Magtromex
digital microscope?

02:48.669 --> 02:50.970
- I didn't even know
it was out yet!
- Pretty great, huh?

02:51.005 --> 02:53.540
I knew, thanks to your
grant money, the new
lab'd be hooked up,

02:53.574 --> 02:55.175
but this is like your
own personal Bat Cave!

02:55.209 --> 02:57.944
And you can use any of it
whenever you want.

02:59.446 --> 03:00.980
I may take you up on that.

03:01.015 --> 03:03.283
Especially since I'm funding
my own research now,

03:03.317 --> 03:04.984
and not saving as much
as I'd hoped,

03:05.019 --> 03:07.854
although I did award myself the
first annual Kettlewell Prize.

03:07.888 --> 03:10.423
- Congratulations?
- It's underfunded.

03:10.457 --> 03:13.660
Looks like I'll be
entering the work force.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.261
Good morning, Cartwright.

03:15.296 --> 03:17.530
Hello, person who's wasting
Cartwright's time.

03:17.565 --> 03:20.533
Actually, I've made some
pretty good progress so far.

03:20.568 --> 03:23.236
I got the wire to re-conduct
for five minutes.

03:23.270 --> 03:25.371
[Dale] You must be proud
of your little protege.

03:25.406 --> 03:28.074
But you know what they say:
Behind every great man...

03:28.108 --> 03:31.077
- ...is a great roommate.
- You're still here?

03:31.111 --> 03:34.280
You need to dig up a jacket
and tie by tonight.

03:34.315 --> 03:37.617
- What for?
- It's time for your moment
in the sun, Cartwright.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.319
It seems that, um,

03:39.353 --> 03:42.455
someone talked up our
Gary Wyatt Grant winner

03:42.489 --> 03:43.690
at the department meeting.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.258
The dean of the
Engineering school

03:45.292 --> 03:47.860
wants to meet CRU's
new wunderkind.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.262
The dean wants to meet me?

03:51.632 --> 03:53.533
[Dale] What about the winner
of the Kettlewell Prize?

03:53.567 --> 03:55.134
Would the dean
like to meet him?

03:57.371 --> 03:58.605
He will.

03:58.606 --> 04:08.606
<font color="#ffff00">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

04:12.703 --> 04:15.338
Ash, there's lipstick
on this glass.

04:15.372 --> 04:17.740
Eight hour no-smear
is such a sham.

04:17.774 --> 04:19.242
I'm not wearing any.

04:19.276 --> 04:21.244
You said you were going
to hire a new hasher.

04:21.278 --> 04:24.414
OK, I'm still a little gun-shy
from the whole Fisher fiasco,

04:24.448 --> 04:27.250
but I will get to it.
Eventually.

04:27.284 --> 04:29.452
[clears throat]

04:29.486 --> 04:32.221
Abby, if you have to go to
the bathroom, you can just go.

04:32.256 --> 04:34.924
No, I'll do it. I'd be happy
to find us a new hasher.

04:40.764 --> 04:43.332
Ash, just let her, please.

04:44.968 --> 04:48.638
- OK, fine. Thanks, Abby.
- Great! I'll start
making flyers!

04:50.174 --> 04:52.241
You know, sometimes
I really like her,

04:52.276 --> 04:54.644
and sometimes I feel
like she might try to
kill us in our sleep.

04:54.678 --> 04:57.013
Forget about that.
I have an important
question to ask.

04:57.047 --> 04:59.215
- OK.
- Would you rather...

05:00.884 --> 05:05.121
have a potato chip
from this bag... Mmm!
Crunchy, crunchy, crunchy...

05:05.155 --> 05:07.190
or from that bag that's red?

05:07.224 --> 05:10.660
OK, obviously,
you want me to pick
the crunchy one. Why?

05:10.694 --> 05:12.595
It's for my retail
marketing class.

05:12.629 --> 05:16.199
My theory is that people'd
rather go for crunch
than what the bag looks like.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.668
I'll put you down in the
"prefers crunch" category.

05:18.702 --> 05:22.038
I'm so happy that
you decided to go into
marketing after college.

05:22.072 --> 05:24.941
I'm actually thinking about
going back to Washington.

05:24.975 --> 05:27.877
- That's great!
- I brought it up
with Cappie.

05:27.911 --> 05:30.947
You and Cappie actually
had a conversation
about graduation?

05:30.981 --> 05:33.282
I wouldn't actually
call it a conversation.

05:33.317 --> 05:35.551
We haven't talked about it
since we got back together.

05:35.586 --> 05:36.986
He hasn't even said the word.

05:38.121 --> 05:40.423
Well, you have to live
your own life, Casey.

05:40.457 --> 05:43.292
You have to go after what you
want and not worry about him.

05:43.327 --> 05:45.895
I don't know where to begin
if I go back to Washington.

05:45.929 --> 05:49.765
Paula Baker's office
saw me as Elle Woods,
so that's not an option.

05:49.800 --> 05:52.735
There's someone you could talk
to who knows about Washington,

05:52.769 --> 05:56.038
whose dad was a senator,
who's...

05:56.073 --> 05:59.141
OK, we need a new hasher, stat!

05:59.176 --> 06:02.178
I just found some leftovers in
the fridge. They're Frannie's.

06:08.185 --> 06:10.319
I can't believe I'm here.
I keep thinking about

06:10.354 --> 06:12.321
all the Ph.D's that
walked through that door.

06:12.356 --> 06:15.124
Stay focused. You're meeting
the dean of the department,

06:15.158 --> 06:17.260
<i>not Justin Guarini
from the American Idols.</i>

06:17.294 --> 06:19.662
It's OK. I prepared
an amusing anecdote

06:19.696 --> 06:21.564
to tell the dean
how I got my inspiration

06:21.598 --> 06:23.733
from watching my fraternity
brothers shoot pool.

06:23.767 --> 06:25.868
No, you didn't.
Don't talk about
your frat house

06:25.903 --> 06:27.603
or toga parties
or beer bongs...

06:27.638 --> 06:29.405
I'm not gonna embarrass...

06:30.541 --> 06:32.675
- [man] Hello, Milton.
- [chuckling]

06:32.709 --> 06:34.143
This must be our
new wunderkind.

06:34.177 --> 06:35.945
Dr. Lundquist,
Rusty Cartwright.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.813
It's such a real honor
to meet you, sir.

06:37.848 --> 06:39.415
Please, I'm the one
who should be honored.

06:39.449 --> 06:41.617
Your self-healing wire is
the talk of the department.

06:41.652 --> 06:44.587
- Thank you, sir.
- I'm always interested
in where ideas come from.

06:44.621 --> 06:46.756
Where did you get
the inspiration
for your breakthrough?

06:46.790 --> 06:51.227
Ah, from these balls.
They weren't actually mine.

06:51.261 --> 06:53.429
I was holding on
to someone else's.

06:53.463 --> 06:54.864
They were my brother's balls.

06:54.898 --> 06:56.799
The balls of my
fraternity brothers.

06:57.701 --> 06:59.902
They were pool balls, sir.

06:59.937 --> 07:03.973
- Combo shot led me
to use the cross-linker.
- Fascinating.

07:04.007 --> 07:08.110
You know, your discovery
could mean big things
for CRU, very big things:

07:08.145 --> 07:10.646
Attracting higher enrollment,
increased endowments.

07:10.681 --> 07:14.483
It lets us say, "Suck it, MIT.
We got Rusty Cartwright."

07:14.518 --> 07:16.085
- [laughter]
- Wow!

07:16.119 --> 07:19.188
I need to tell the trustees
about our major breakthrough

07:19.222 --> 07:21.090
at the budget meeting
next month.

07:21.124 --> 07:23.459
Think you could have some
patent-ready diagrams by then?

07:23.493 --> 07:26.028
Aw, that's a little fast.
We just started working...

07:26.063 --> 07:28.631
He's being modest.
He was just telling me

07:28.665 --> 07:31.367
he's making real progress,
weren't you, Cartwright?

07:31.401 --> 07:33.369
Ha! I knew we could
count on our wunderkind.

07:33.403 --> 07:35.871
Now, let me introduce
the department heads.

07:35.906 --> 07:39.108
They are dying to meet
their future colleague.
[chuckles]

07:40.210 --> 07:42.378
[murmuring, laughing]

07:45.282 --> 07:49.118
- What is going on here?
- We're here for the hasher job.

07:49.152 --> 07:50.720
Hey, you're Ashleigh, right?

07:51.822 --> 07:54.824
- I'm Hunter.
- Oh, hell no.

07:57.194 --> 07:59.428
<i>What is going on here?
It looks like GQ</i>

07:59.463 --> 08:02.798
<i>crashed into Men's Health
and spilled hot guys
all over our living room.</i>

08:02.833 --> 08:05.968
Oh, apparently the word
was out about you and
the last hasher hooking up,

08:06.003 --> 08:07.303
so a lot of the guys
want the job.

08:07.337 --> 08:09.672
These are the ones
I really want...

08:09.706 --> 08:11.007
for the job.

08:11.041 --> 08:14.176
Just because you have issues
doesn't mean the rest of us

08:14.211 --> 08:16.112
shouldn't have our chance
at a hasher hookup.

08:16.146 --> 08:18.347
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Casey.

08:18.382 --> 08:20.416
She's not here right now.

08:20.450 --> 08:22.418
I suppose I can
talk to you, then.

08:22.452 --> 08:24.420
I'm here about the flier.

08:24.454 --> 08:27.256
The hasher job.
Uh, I do have experience.

08:27.290 --> 08:28.891
I waited tables at Bible camp.

08:28.925 --> 08:32.428
And back home
I cleaned up, uh,
actual pigsties.

08:32.462 --> 08:36.164
Oh, you're Rusty's
funny friend, Kyle.

08:36.198 --> 08:38.801
Dale. Once again, Dale.

08:38.835 --> 08:41.303
Uh, I have a reference
here from my boss

08:41.337 --> 08:43.706
one summer at Tacos and Donuts.

08:43.740 --> 08:45.508
It was only
for a couple of weeks.

08:45.542 --> 08:48.177
They needed
replacement dishwashers
after this INS raid,

08:48.211 --> 08:51.147
- but they let on that...
- You're hired.

08:51.181 --> 08:52.848
[all gasp and murmur]

08:52.883 --> 08:54.583
- Congratulations.
- Great.

08:57.654 --> 09:00.656
- Professor Hastings.
- Ah, the wunderkind.

09:00.691 --> 09:02.925
- Beats being the Anchor,
doesn't it?
- That was amazing.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.794
I'm practically
on a first-name basis

09:04.828 --> 09:07.630
with three doctoral candidates
and a Nobel Prize winner.

09:07.664 --> 09:11.734
Do you think we can be
patent-ready in a month
like we promised Teddy?

09:11.768 --> 09:15.738
- Ted? Dr. Lundquist?
- You're going to have to be.

09:15.772 --> 09:17.573
You're in the big leagues
now, Cartwright.

09:17.607 --> 09:20.476
But just to be sure,
I thought you might be able
to use some help.

09:20.510 --> 09:22.812
So I arranged for
an outstanding student

09:22.846 --> 09:25.481
from my advanced physics class
to assist you.

09:25.515 --> 09:29.351
Really? An assistant, huh?
I've never had
an assistant before.

09:29.386 --> 09:32.421
Ah, here she is now.
Cartwright, meet Stockwell.

09:34.658 --> 09:36.292
Hey, Dana.

09:36.326 --> 09:38.828
Actually, we know each other.

09:38.862 --> 09:41.063
Is she asking me?

09:41.098 --> 09:43.299
The way her inflection
went up at the end there,

09:43.333 --> 09:46.335
- it sounded like a question.
- We kinda met before.

09:46.369 --> 09:47.737
[sighs]

09:50.807 --> 09:54.110
Oh, I get that you want
to work in Washington.
The question is "Why?"

09:54.144 --> 09:55.444
What do you mean?

09:55.479 --> 09:58.114
DC's a dark and vile place
full of bad, selfish people

09:58.148 --> 10:00.583
who have no interest
in anything but corruption
and blind power.

10:00.617 --> 10:02.284
I don't believe
it's all like that.

10:03.253 --> 10:05.588
- Hey, Casey!
- Hi! Dale.

10:05.622 --> 10:08.758
[groans] Ashleigh waits
a month to find a new hasher,

10:08.792 --> 10:11.627
- and then hires Bible Boy.
- Wow, you're unpleasant.

10:11.661 --> 10:13.329
Anyway, I prepared
a shopping list.

10:13.363 --> 10:15.364
If there's anything special
you'd like, let me know.

10:15.398 --> 10:17.900
I was thinking
I might whip up a batch
of my Aunt Gertie's

10:17.934 --> 10:20.603
- award-winning vinegar pie
just for you.
- Great.

10:20.637 --> 10:23.005
- That sounds disgusting.
- Wasn't offering any to you.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.741
Anyway, have
a blessed day, Case.

10:27.277 --> 10:29.879
Guess Ashleigh and I won't be
fighting over this one.

10:29.913 --> 10:33.315
So, let's assume,
for a second, that Washington
isn't all a cesspool.

10:33.350 --> 10:34.650
What do you want to do there?

10:34.684 --> 10:36.685
Be a lobbyist,
work for a federal agency,

10:36.720 --> 10:39.588
- play for the Redskins?
- Lobbyist could be
interesting.

10:39.623 --> 10:42.892
OK. So you want to be a whore?
That's what most of them are.

10:42.926 --> 10:45.928
You have to wine and dine
politicians, sometimes more.

10:45.962 --> 10:48.831
It wouldn't be
like that. I'd work for
an environmental group.

10:48.865 --> 10:51.233
So you'd be a
green whore? How PC.

10:51.268 --> 10:53.435
[gasps] Maybe they could
pay you in weed.

10:53.470 --> 10:57.640
The truth is, I really
want to work on new
legislation, making laws.

10:57.674 --> 10:59.308
Unless you're
running for office,

10:59.342 --> 11:01.443
and that 16-year-old
you slept with

11:01.478 --> 11:04.613
or the Psi Phi Pi brownies
could be teensy problems.

11:04.648 --> 11:07.316
- You should probably
start in Congress.
- How do I do that?

11:07.350 --> 11:09.785
I might know someone
you could talk to,
but you'd owe me.

11:09.820 --> 11:12.188
Seriously
you wouldn't do me
a favor this one time

11:12.222 --> 11:14.790
- without expecting
something in return?
- Nope.

11:14.825 --> 11:17.560
That's your first lesson.
Welcome to politics.

11:23.507 --> 11:25.775
Hey, could you hand me
the microthermometer?

11:25.809 --> 11:28.477
You ever check the throughput
on this fraction collector?

11:28.512 --> 11:30.379
Yes. The microthermometer,
please?

11:30.413 --> 11:32.648
You should probably
check it again.

11:32.682 --> 11:34.316
You know, you're the assistant.

11:34.351 --> 11:35.918
You're supposed to assist me.

11:35.952 --> 11:38.854
Oh, right, because
you're Mr. Wunderkind.

11:38.889 --> 11:40.322
Big whoop.

11:40.357 --> 11:43.125
Well, according to the dean,
it's a fairly large whoop.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.560
[scoffs]

11:44.594 --> 11:46.896
Look, I realize
this is awkward,

11:46.930 --> 11:50.065
- but we're just gonna
have to work through it.
- Why is it awkward?

11:50.100 --> 11:53.302
Because you said you liked me,
and I didn't remember you.

11:53.336 --> 11:54.870
Then I asked you out,
and you blew me off.

11:54.905 --> 11:59.642
Oh! Right. No. Now I see
why it's awkward, for you.

12:01.044 --> 12:03.746
Hey, this is a
big deal for me, OK?

12:03.780 --> 12:05.781
It wasn't too long ago
I was the Anchor

12:05.816 --> 12:08.384
- and now I'm about to
have my name on a patent.
- [scoffs]

12:08.418 --> 12:10.920
I appreciate your help,

12:10.954 --> 12:12.588
but we have to focus
and work quickly

12:12.622 --> 12:14.356
if we're going to
get this done on time,

12:14.391 --> 12:16.458
and it would be great
if we could get along.

12:16.493 --> 12:18.260
Are you trying
to ask me out again?

12:18.295 --> 12:19.962
You want me to
ask you out again?

12:19.996 --> 12:22.198
Well, it wouldn't be
appropriate, would it?

12:22.232 --> 12:25.067
- I mean, I am your assistant.
- Right.

12:25.101 --> 12:28.604
- So could you hand me
the microthermometer?
- [scoffs]

12:28.638 --> 12:30.172
Will you please
stop doing that?

12:38.014 --> 12:40.416
If anybody knows his way
inside the Beltway it's Joel.

12:40.450 --> 12:42.685
He did a lot of heavy lifting
on the Hill for my father.

12:42.719 --> 12:44.486
He worked for your father?

12:44.521 --> 12:47.590
Just because he worked
for my dad doesn't
make him a slimeball.

12:47.624 --> 12:49.058
He's a do-gooder.

12:50.994 --> 12:54.530
Rebecca! Hey.

12:54.564 --> 12:56.565
- How's your dad?
- Oh, you know,

12:56.600 --> 12:58.868
trying to fall back
in love with my mom

12:58.902 --> 13:01.804
by never being in
the same state with her.

13:01.838 --> 13:04.440
Oh, this is my...

13:04.474 --> 13:08.210
Casey. She wants to work
in the cesspool
of lies and greed

13:08.245 --> 13:10.446
known as Washington.
I tried to talk her
out of it.

13:10.480 --> 13:11.680
Maybe she'll listen to you.

13:11.715 --> 13:13.716
I happen to think
politics gets a bad rap.

13:13.750 --> 13:15.384
A lot of good
comes out of Washington.

13:15.418 --> 13:18.787
- You want to barf, right?
- Same old Rebecca.

13:18.822 --> 13:21.457
So, tell me what
you've been doing, Casey.

13:21.491 --> 13:23.826
What makes you think
that you want to work in DC?

13:23.860 --> 13:27.396
Well, I just feel like I
have something to contribute.

13:27.430 --> 13:29.531
It's why I kind of ran
for ZBZ President,

13:29.566 --> 13:30.900
and why I've been
working on Panhellenic,

13:30.934 --> 13:33.202
and why I interned
for Paula Baker.

13:33.236 --> 13:35.204
It sounds like you're
on the right track,

13:35.238 --> 13:38.207
although it never hurts
to have more experience
for those Hill jobs.

13:38.241 --> 13:40.676
- Like working on a campaign?
- Among other things.

13:40.710 --> 13:42.544
We always need help
with voter registration.

13:42.579 --> 13:44.613
We're trying to target
more college students,

13:44.648 --> 13:46.015
get them involved
in the process.

13:46.049 --> 13:47.750
Is that something
you'd be interested in?

13:47.784 --> 13:49.685
Getting signatures?
I can do that.

13:49.719 --> 13:51.553
Great. I'll get the forms.

13:52.889 --> 13:54.423
This is exciting.

13:54.457 --> 13:57.960
Do little cartoon birds
hold up your robe for you
every morning?

14:04.034 --> 14:05.901
Hey, Ashleigh,
I got a question.

14:05.936 --> 14:07.970
Yes, Dale,
I've heard the good word.

14:08.004 --> 14:09.905
Uh, not my question,
but glad to hear it.

14:09.940 --> 14:12.875
I thought it'd be nice to
spruce up dinner tonight,

14:12.909 --> 14:16.245
and since I did take
a napkin folding class
at Christian manners camp,

14:16.279 --> 14:19.848
I was wondering, would you
prefer the bird of paradise
or the goblet fan fold?

14:19.883 --> 14:21.984
[chuckles] Good one.

14:24.521 --> 14:26.522
Oh! Um...

14:26.556 --> 14:28.190
the bird?

14:29.659 --> 14:30.960
Excellent choice.

14:37.734 --> 14:40.202
Billy Graham Cracker
has got to go.

14:40.236 --> 14:42.471
What do you mean?
The house is already cleaner,

14:42.505 --> 14:44.606
the pantry is stocked
for the first time in weeks

14:44.641 --> 14:46.141
and, look, he made
a little bird.

14:46.176 --> 14:48.610
He put psalms
in the cereal boxes,

14:48.645 --> 14:51.146
and instead of pouring
the pretzels into bowls

14:51.181 --> 14:52.982
he lays them out
in little crosses.

14:53.016 --> 14:55.617
Yeah, so, he's
a little religious.

14:55.652 --> 14:58.721
I think what we're trying to say
is, although we understand

14:58.755 --> 15:00.656
how Dale suits you
and your issue,

15:00.690 --> 15:02.558
the house would be
much better served

15:02.592 --> 15:04.893
with someone that's more
in sync with the rest of us,

15:04.928 --> 15:07.830
someone that's more
responsive to our needs...

15:07.864 --> 15:10.299
Someone hotter that we can
totally hook up with.

15:10.333 --> 15:12.768
Someone... not Dale.

15:14.204 --> 15:15.204
No.

15:16.239 --> 15:17.573
[sighs]

15:20.910 --> 15:23.445
Have you registered
to vote? How about you?

15:23.480 --> 15:25.247
- [boy] No, thanks.
- It's your civic duty.

15:25.281 --> 15:26.448
[boy 2] Nah, I'm good.

15:27.283 --> 15:29.318
Hey, Case.
How's it going?

15:29.352 --> 15:32.121
Not great. People
either don't know why
they should register,

15:32.155 --> 15:33.322
don't know why they
should register now

15:33.356 --> 15:35.357
or they think I'm
a front for Scientology.

15:35.392 --> 15:38.193
It was so much easier
getting signatures
for the Undie Run.

15:38.228 --> 15:41.997
You're telling me
college students are more into
getting naked than voting?

15:42.032 --> 15:43.932
- I'm shocked.
- [chuckles]

15:43.967 --> 15:47.636
Oh, hey, Rebecca
told me about your plans
to work in Washington.

15:47.670 --> 15:49.838
You're not the only one
with political aspirations.

15:49.873 --> 15:52.541
- I think that's great, Case.
- Thank you, Evan.

15:52.575 --> 15:55.644
I'm glad to see
that your personal life
is not holding you back.

15:55.678 --> 15:57.746
Thank you, Evan.

15:57.781 --> 16:00.616
- I think you're
both delusional.
- [Evan] Could be.

16:00.650 --> 16:03.218
- OK, I gotta get
to class. See you later?
- OK.

16:06.689 --> 16:09.124
Wow, looks like you and
Evan are going strong.

16:09.159 --> 16:11.627
- Are we really
gonna do this?
- Apparently not.

16:11.661 --> 16:13.629
Good. We need to talk about
your sales technique.

16:13.663 --> 16:16.231
- What's wrong with it?
- Are you kidding?

16:16.266 --> 16:18.500
Politics is all about
scare tactics.

16:18.535 --> 16:20.169
Didn't you learn anything
from the Bush years?

16:23.907 --> 16:25.908
Watch and learn.

16:25.942 --> 16:27.576
You're telling me if
I don't register to vote

16:27.610 --> 16:30.112
they're gonna bring back the
draft, and they're taking girls?

16:30.146 --> 16:32.514
- [all gasp]
- Where do I sign?

16:35.952 --> 16:40.122
Impressive. And thank you again
for introducing me to Joel.

16:40.156 --> 16:42.925
You should thank me.
After the election
he's going back to DC

16:42.959 --> 16:45.260
- as the representative's
chief of staff...
- Oh.

16:45.295 --> 16:47.362
Which means he's in charge
of hiring legislative aides.

16:47.397 --> 16:50.699
Which means if I impress
him, then I could get
one of those jobs.

16:50.733 --> 16:53.402
And Cappie could open up
a DC chapter of Kappa Tau.

16:53.436 --> 16:55.804
- We haven't
talked about it.
- Good luck with that.

16:57.974 --> 17:00.542
All right, you try these guys.

17:00.577 --> 17:03.178
Hey, uh, register to vote,

17:03.213 --> 17:06.714
or they, uh, might outlaw porn.

17:14.124 --> 17:16.558
[rock music playing]

17:16.593 --> 17:20.028
Go! Come on!

17:20.063 --> 17:22.231
Have any of you guys
seen my project notebook?

17:22.232 --> 17:24.398
You're missing all
the excitement, Spitter.

17:24.434 --> 17:26.234
There's the crowds,
the crashes.

17:26.269 --> 17:28.904
It's even better
than last year's
record-setting pace.

17:28.938 --> 17:31.540
I think my turtle died.

17:34.010 --> 17:35.077
No, just pooped.

17:35.111 --> 17:37.546
Maybe the lighter weight
will speed him up.

17:37.580 --> 17:39.214
Less wind resistance.

17:39.249 --> 17:41.750
Or maybe that's just
part of his strategy,

17:41.784 --> 17:45.888
like James Bond,
so everyone behind him'll
spin out on his poop slick.

17:45.922 --> 17:47.289
See what you're missing?

17:47.323 --> 17:49.892
Hey, actually, I was
gonna ask you something.

17:49.926 --> 17:52.361
Has Casey mentioned
anything to you
about me and her

17:52.395 --> 17:55.764
- or... the "G" word?
- [groans]

17:55.798 --> 17:57.266
I don't think it's appropriate

17:57.300 --> 17:59.535
to talk about that part
of my sister's anatomy.

17:59.569 --> 18:02.104
No, I'm talking
black gowns, tassels...

18:02.138 --> 18:04.806
Seriously, Cap, I don't
want to talk about that.

18:06.342 --> 18:08.544
- Oh, you mean graduation?
- Yeah, that.

18:08.578 --> 18:10.212
I never understood the appeal.

18:10.246 --> 18:12.948
Why would I want to leave? My
favorite coffee place is here,

18:12.982 --> 18:16.552
my friends are here.
The weather
never seems to change.

18:16.586 --> 18:18.220
It won't always be that way.

18:18.254 --> 18:20.722
Yeah, yeah, I know.
The sun will
eventually burn out,

18:20.757 --> 18:22.691
leaving the Earth
a cold, lifeless cinder,

18:22.725 --> 18:24.426
but I figure by then
I' get a scarf.

18:24.460 --> 18:26.895
I mean, your friends
won't always be here.

18:26.930 --> 18:28.564
People are going to move on.

18:28.598 --> 18:31.900
Remember how you felt
losing Wade, almost Heath?

18:31.935 --> 18:35.470
- [sighs]
- Casey's gonna graduate in May.

18:35.505 --> 18:37.773
Thought you talked
about this before
you got back together.

18:37.807 --> 18:39.374
- Well...
- Oh, there it is.

18:39.409 --> 18:41.944
- [clattering]
- [murmuring]

18:42.812 --> 18:43.912
Sorry.

18:45.915 --> 18:47.549
- That's the thing, we didn't.
- [cell phone rings]

18:47.584 --> 18:48.750
One second, one second.

18:50.186 --> 18:53.155
Hi, Professor Hastings. Yeah,
I was just on my way back...

18:53.189 --> 18:54.590
Yeah.

18:55.725 --> 18:57.726
You're kidding me.
It's gonna happen?

18:57.760 --> 19:00.629
OK, I'll be back.
Sure. OK.

19:00.663 --> 19:03.265
- Good news?
- There's gonna be
an article about me,

19:03.299 --> 19:05.234
with photos, interviews,
the whole deal.

19:05.268 --> 19:08.604
The university
is sending a photographer
to take my picture today.

19:08.638 --> 19:12.507
<i>- I'm gonna be in EW.
- EW?</i>

19:12.542 --> 19:14.743
<i>- Spitter's gonna be in
Entertainment Weekly.
- [cheering]</i>

19:14.777 --> 19:17.613
<i>- Awesome.
- Uh, Engineering Weekly.</i>

19:17.647 --> 19:20.782
- Oh. Never mind.
- Mmm.

19:22.452 --> 19:25.854
- Still, good.
- All right, I gotta get going.

19:30.890 --> 19:32.791
- [Dale] You look good
for the photo.
- [Rusty] Thanks.

19:32.826 --> 19:35.561
<i>You know who else
has been in EW?
People like Carl Sagan,</i>

19:35.595 --> 19:38.831
Stephen Hawking,
and now Rusty Cartwright.

19:38.865 --> 19:41.967
- It's hard to believe.
- Yes, it is.

19:42.002 --> 19:44.970
Hey, so how's that new
hasher job going for you?

19:45.005 --> 19:47.873
It's good.
It's amazing what slobs

19:47.907 --> 19:50.642
sorority girls can be,
but it's good.

19:50.677 --> 19:53.178
I thought Ashleigh was
never gonna hire anybody

19:53.213 --> 19:56.248
- after the whole Fisher thing.
- Who's Fisher?

19:56.282 --> 19:59.118
He's the guy who had
the job before you
when they were dating.

19:59.152 --> 20:00.786
They had an
intimate relationship?

20:00.820 --> 20:03.555
Until they broke up,
and then she fired him.

20:04.791 --> 20:06.825
- What?!
- I'm sorry I'm late.

20:07.761 --> 20:09.661
Oh, wow.

20:09.696 --> 20:11.463
Um, I'll catch up
with you later.

20:13.666 --> 20:16.535
- Have you been
waiting long?
- Uh... no.

20:16.569 --> 20:18.871
I just got hair...
here. [laughs]

20:18.905 --> 20:21.340
Go ahead and laugh, but
I'll be the one laughing

20:21.374 --> 20:23.976
<i>when my ex-partner
sees this in EW.</i>

20:24.010 --> 20:26.245
This is how I would've
looked 20 years ago

20:26.279 --> 20:27.980
if I got the credit I deserved
for our miniature hard drive.

20:28.014 --> 20:30.582
- You would've had a toupee?
- I would've had my hair!

20:30.617 --> 20:32.818
Along with everything else
he got instead of me:

20:32.852 --> 20:34.820
The success,
the respect of our peers,

20:34.854 --> 20:36.422
the Victoria's Secret model.

20:36.456 --> 20:38.357
This is just
the beginning for us.

20:38.391 --> 20:39.925
<i>First EW,
then Charlie Rose,</i>

20:39.959 --> 20:42.094
<i>and after that,
who knows? Nova?</i>

20:42.128 --> 20:45.264
We don't even have
a wire that lasts longer
than five minutes.

20:45.298 --> 20:48.567
Then I suggest you
make that happen ASAP.

20:48.601 --> 20:51.603
Everyone's counting
on you, Cartwright.

20:51.638 --> 20:54.106
[woman] OK, guys, let's
get ready for the picture.

20:57.677 --> 20:59.211
Move in a little closer.

21:03.850 --> 21:06.251
Thanks. Hey, Casey.

21:06.286 --> 21:08.921
Whoa! Are those all
new voter registrations?

21:08.955 --> 21:11.190
Uh, yep. Um,
and I already edited out

21:11.224 --> 21:14.960
all the Eileen Dovers
and Ivana Nailors.

21:14.994 --> 21:16.728
So they're pretty much
good to go.

21:16.763 --> 21:18.664
- Wow, you're really
good at this.
- Thanks!

21:18.698 --> 21:21.867
It's amazing what you can
accomplish when you speak to
what's important to people.

21:21.901 --> 21:24.803
It's kind of how I felt
working for Paula Baker
on the carbon emissions bill.

21:24.838 --> 21:26.438
I didn't know you worked
on the Baker bill.

21:26.473 --> 21:29.541
Yeah. Um...

21:29.576 --> 21:32.678
Well, I was just happy
to see it made it out
of conference committee

21:32.712 --> 21:34.813
without a lot of amendments.

21:36.883 --> 21:39.118
Oh, me, too. It's a good
piece of legislation.

21:39.152 --> 21:42.121
Let me know if you
want to do some more
campus registrations.

21:42.155 --> 21:45.891
Actually, I had this idea
to get a lot of new
student voters all at once.

21:45.925 --> 21:48.093
There's this bar
near campus called Dobler's...

21:48.128 --> 21:50.629
I went to law school
at CRU. I'm familiar
with Dobler's,

21:50.663 --> 21:52.297
perhaps too familiar.

21:52.332 --> 21:55.634
I was thinking
that we could throw a big
voter registration party

21:55.668 --> 21:59.438
with this organization called
Do Something, that promotes
students getting involved.

21:59.472 --> 22:02.241
We could offer a free cover
for every new voter.

22:02.275 --> 22:05.110
You know, that is
a really good idea.

22:05.145 --> 22:06.778
If you could pull that off,
it'd be great.

22:06.813 --> 22:08.647
Better than great,
it'd be fantastic.

22:08.681 --> 22:12.284
- Maybe even impressive?
- Are you kidding? Big time.

22:16.656 --> 22:20.125
So, Dale, um... Hi.

22:20.160 --> 22:22.928
- Ooh, shiny.
- Drop the act, Ashleigh.

22:22.962 --> 22:26.398
- I know what this is all about.
- You do?

22:26.432 --> 22:28.867
I know the real reason
you hired me.

22:29.936 --> 22:31.670
- Oh.
- [sighs]

22:31.704 --> 22:33.605
Dale, I don't know
what to say. I...

22:33.640 --> 22:36.208
Well, I heard about
what happened
with my predecessor,

22:36.242 --> 22:38.343
and it's pretty clear to me
that you expect the hasher

22:38.378 --> 22:40.145
to be your personal concubine.

22:41.681 --> 22:44.283
- Wait, what?
- [sighs]

22:44.317 --> 22:48.554
Well, despite
what you may have heard
about my recent... lapse,

22:48.588 --> 22:50.956
I'm not that kind of guy
anymore, OK?

22:50.990 --> 22:53.158
I can't be your new
hasher boy-toy.

22:53.193 --> 22:56.094
[laughs] Oh, my God,
you're such a riot.

22:56.129 --> 22:57.729
You're like Dane Cook,
but funny.

22:57.764 --> 22:59.631
Sexual harassment
is no laughing matter.

22:59.666 --> 23:02.334
I felt your yearning looks
as I leave a room,

23:02.368 --> 23:04.403
the accidental
physical contact.

23:04.437 --> 23:07.773
- Seriously?
- I need a secure job
to fund my project.

23:07.807 --> 23:10.242
I can't afford
to be your plaything

23:10.276 --> 23:13.178
and be tossed aside once
you inevitably desire

23:13.213 --> 23:15.180
a new carnal conquest.

23:15.215 --> 23:17.849
You know, I'm sorry,
Ashleigh, I quit.

23:24.057 --> 23:25.757
[snoring]

23:25.792 --> 23:27.659
- Dana.
- [gasping]

23:27.694 --> 23:29.861
You were sleeping.
Why aren't you working?

23:29.896 --> 23:33.265
OK, first of all, it's rude
to speak in that tone of voice

23:33.299 --> 23:34.666
to someone who just woke up.

23:34.701 --> 23:36.735
Sorry, but we're on
a tight schedule here.

23:36.769 --> 23:39.104
There's a lot of people
waiting for me to finish this.

23:39.138 --> 23:41.006
Uh... Yeah,

23:41.040 --> 23:44.042
I, uh, I hate to break it
to you, but I don't actually

23:44.077 --> 23:46.044
think that's gonna
happen any time soon.

23:46.079 --> 23:48.480
- [sighs] What are you
talking about?
- I checked your work,

23:48.514 --> 23:50.682
and it looks like you're
heading for a dead end.

23:50.717 --> 23:53.218
With the current formulation,
maybe we can push the wire

23:53.253 --> 23:56.221
to reconduct for 20 minutes,
half hour tops.

23:56.256 --> 23:58.390
But the decay'll accelerate
and then it's dead.

23:58.424 --> 24:01.360
No offense,
but I don't think you know
what you're talking about.

24:01.394 --> 24:03.228
I think I know
as much as you do,

24:03.263 --> 24:06.031
and you might see that if you
weren't so cocky all the time.

24:06.065 --> 24:09.234
I am not being cocky.
I did win a major grant
for this.

24:09.269 --> 24:11.336
- [scoffs]
- OK, that sounded cocky,

24:11.371 --> 24:13.071
but you just said
my wire won't work.

24:13.106 --> 24:16.975
Not unless you plan to keep
the environmental temperature
at absolute zero.

24:17.010 --> 24:20.712
A patentable prototype
at room temperature?
Ch-yeah, right!

24:20.747 --> 24:22.981
You're gonna have to
start out with a new formula.

24:23.016 --> 24:25.317
Now this doesn't have
anything to do

24:25.351 --> 24:26.585
with you being mad at me

24:26.619 --> 24:28.887
for forgetting your name
at first, right?

24:28.921 --> 24:30.355
What?! Oh, my God!

24:30.390 --> 24:33.091
I was just asking.
That was out of line.

24:33.126 --> 24:36.128
But if this is about that,
I said I was sorry.

24:36.162 --> 24:39.464
- I wanted
to go out with you.
- I'm out of here.

24:41.034 --> 24:44.836
But, um, if you can climb off
your ginormous ego
for five minutes,

24:44.871 --> 24:47.973
which is about how long
your stupid wire's
ever gonna last,

24:48.007 --> 24:49.408
you might wanna check my notes.

24:49.442 --> 24:51.176
It's all in there
in black and white.

24:51.210 --> 24:53.512
Later, dunderkind.

25:00.486 --> 25:02.554
[snoring]

25:11.464 --> 25:13.265
Wow, someone's in a good mood.

25:13.299 --> 25:17.069
Um, yeah, well, I think
I might have some pretty
exciting news.

25:17.103 --> 25:19.338
Things have been getting
pretty exciting here, too.

25:19.372 --> 25:21.907
I think Earnhardt is
gonna try and make his move

25:21.941 --> 25:23.442
coming into this next turn.

25:23.476 --> 25:25.077
Yeah, it's a nail-biter,
all right.

25:25.111 --> 25:28.547
Listen, I had this idea
for a voter registration
party at Dobler's.

25:28.581 --> 25:30.649
- Well, that is exciting.
- No, that's not it.

25:30.683 --> 25:33.685
But, if it goes well
and if this congresswoman
gets re-elected,

25:33.720 --> 25:35.821
I might have a shot
at a job in Washington
in the fall.

25:35.855 --> 25:37.923
And not just making copies,

25:37.957 --> 25:40.992
but a real job
as a legislative aide.

25:42.161 --> 25:43.762
Well, you know what they say:

25:43.796 --> 25:46.264
When life gives you
legislatives,

25:46.299 --> 25:47.632
make legislative aide.

25:47.667 --> 25:49.701
- [chuckles]
- That's great, Case.

25:50.837 --> 25:54.306
Anyway, um, that's really soon.

25:54.340 --> 25:58.143
So... I think, maybe,
we should talk about,

25:58.177 --> 26:00.779
you know, the future.

26:02.248 --> 26:04.182
And I was wondering
what you were thinking

26:04.217 --> 26:07.786
about you and me and, um...

26:09.055 --> 26:11.123
graduation?

26:11.157 --> 26:12.958
So, what do you think?

26:18.030 --> 26:19.564
I like turtles.

26:21.434 --> 26:24.569
- What?
- Listen, Case, I know
it may not seem like it,

26:24.604 --> 26:27.305
but I have given this a lot
of thought, and I have a plan.

26:27.340 --> 26:29.374
You do? That's great.
What is it?

26:29.409 --> 26:33.011
We'll figure it out
when the time comes.

26:33.045 --> 26:34.679
- That's your plan?
- Yeah.

26:34.714 --> 26:36.715
That's not a plan.
That is a plan
to make a plan.

26:36.749 --> 26:39.117
- Which is a plan, is it not?
- You don't even have a major.

26:39.152 --> 26:41.720
I just don't see the need
to hash out all the details

26:41.754 --> 26:43.989
before it's
absolutely necessary.

26:44.023 --> 26:46.992
If you'll excuse me,
I thjnk Earnhardt
blew out a left rear claw.

26:47.026 --> 26:49.127
I think I need to get him
into the pit crew.

26:51.531 --> 26:53.665
[snoring]

27:02.215 --> 27:03.882
Uh, Ash said to give you this.

27:03.916 --> 27:06.752
Dale's last, and only,
hasher check.

27:06.786 --> 27:08.086
Why couldn't he come himself?

27:08.121 --> 27:09.821
He said he wanted to, quote,

27:09.856 --> 27:13.291
"avoid even the appearance
of impropriety,"

27:13.326 --> 27:14.760
whatever that means.

27:14.794 --> 27:17.162
Yeah... Oh, hey, um,
I don't know if you heard,

27:17.196 --> 27:20.832
but I am throwing this
voter registration party
at Dobler's tonight.

27:20.867 --> 27:24.836
<i>- You should come.
- I can't. I'm being
interviewed by EW tonight.</i>

27:24.871 --> 27:27.239
<i>- Oh!
- Engineering Weekly.</i>

27:27.273 --> 27:30.575
Oh, yeah. Got it.
But that's, like,
a really big deal, right?

27:30.610 --> 27:32.444
You should be proud.

27:33.546 --> 27:36.047
Yeah, sure. Here,
let's sit for a second.

27:36.082 --> 27:39.785
[sighs] It's just, uh,
I have this assistant

27:39.819 --> 27:42.988
who thinks I'm heading
down a blind alley
with my wire,

27:43.022 --> 27:45.424
so I'm not feeling all
that proud right now.

27:46.592 --> 27:48.927
Hey, but this party of
yours sounds impressive.

27:48.961 --> 27:51.329
Yeah, I'm hoping
it'll get me a job in DC,

27:51.364 --> 27:53.765
but it's causing this weirdness
between me and Cappie,

27:53.800 --> 27:55.834
and I don't know
if it's even worth it

27:55.868 --> 27:58.837
'cause Rebec says
everyone in Washington
is a slimeball.

27:58.871 --> 28:01.239
- Why are you
listening to Rebecca?
- Good point.

28:02.241 --> 28:03.508
But what about Cappie?

28:03.543 --> 28:06.011
Maybe Cappie will surprise you.

28:06.045 --> 28:07.579
Maybe.

28:07.613 --> 28:10.515
And maybe you should be more
excited about this interview.

28:10.550 --> 28:14.519
- You've worked hard. Enjoy it.
- I know.

28:14.554 --> 28:16.421
- Look at us.
- [chuckles]

28:16.456 --> 28:18.690
The Cartwrights
are kicking ass.

28:18.724 --> 28:20.325
Yes, we are.

28:26.299 --> 28:30.569
Hey! So, who's
the hottie I saw you
talking to downstairs?

28:30.603 --> 28:32.971
That would be Hunter,
our new hasher.

28:33.005 --> 28:36.107
His name's Hunter?
Seriously?

28:36.142 --> 28:40.312
- What happened to Bible Boy?
- He didn't want to be
my sexual plaything.

28:40.346 --> 28:41.813
Ash, has it really
come to that?

28:41.848 --> 28:45.984
So Hunter's all yours.
You can kiss him, jump on him,

28:46.018 --> 28:47.686
roll him in bread crumbs
for all I care,

28:47.720 --> 28:50.388
'cause I am done with
the whole Fisher thing.

28:50.423 --> 28:54.059
OK, that new hasher
has got to go.

28:54.093 --> 28:56.161
You're kidding, right?

28:56.195 --> 28:58.730
He is smokin' hot! I thought
that's what everybody wanted.

28:58.764 --> 29:01.700
We thought so, too,
but we get a bad
feeling about him.

29:01.734 --> 29:04.102
- He seems kinda pervy.
- We want Dale back.

29:04.136 --> 29:06.338
He's weird and judgey,
but we trust him.

29:06.372 --> 29:08.840
Well, I can't get
Dale back. He quit.

29:08.875 --> 29:10.275
I brought you ladies
some towels

29:10.309 --> 29:12.277
in case you want to
take a shower later.

29:14.847 --> 29:16.314
Thank you.

29:25.758 --> 29:27.559
- I'll call Dale.
- Yeah.

29:30.129 --> 29:32.197
[rock music playing]

29:35.301 --> 29:38.036
Well... I'm impressed.

29:38.070 --> 29:39.905
You actually made
registering to vote

29:39.939 --> 29:42.240
not seem like a total
boring waste of time.

29:42.275 --> 29:45.176
Yeah, I hope Joel feels
the same way, mostly.

29:45.211 --> 29:48.280
- Have you seen him yet?
- No, but here's your boyfriend.

29:48.314 --> 29:49.881
Rebecca. Hey, Case.

29:49.916 --> 29:52.050
- Hey.
- Can I get you a drink?

29:52.084 --> 29:54.920
I can't. Working.
I would love a water.

29:54.954 --> 29:56.521
Water. OK, sure.

29:58.991 --> 30:00.592
That was awkward.
What's up?

30:00.626 --> 30:03.662
- Um, are we really
going to do this?
- Yeah.

30:03.696 --> 30:06.798
Fine. Um, I told him
about Washington,

30:06.832 --> 30:09.834
!nd that we should
talk about graduation.

30:09.869 --> 30:12.470
- What did he say?
- "I like turtles."

30:12.505 --> 30:16.374
Oh. Well,
what'd you expect?

30:16.409 --> 30:19.644
That's our...
uh, your Cappie.

30:24.884 --> 30:27.819
- Great turnout, Casey.
I'm impressed.
- Thanks, Joel.

30:27.853 --> 30:30.655
With these demos,
we can really address
a solid voting block.

30:30.690 --> 30:33.124
Yawn. Wonk talk.
That's my cue.

30:38.598 --> 30:41.266
This place is packed.
Casey must be really happy.

30:41.300 --> 30:45.737
She would be, but she tried
to talk to Cappie about working
in Washington after graduation,

30:45.771 --> 30:47.806
and he just wants
to talk about turtles.

30:50.843 --> 30:51.843
Of course.

30:58.884 --> 31:01.152
I knew you'd find a way
to blow it.

31:01.187 --> 31:04.155
You know,
talking to yourself
is a sign of insanity.

31:04.190 --> 31:05.690
It's turning out
just like I said:

31:05.725 --> 31:07.492
Casey's gonna leave you
after graduation,

31:07.526 --> 31:10.161
and what will you have
left here? Turtles.

31:11.530 --> 31:13.365
Oh, here you go. [laughs]

31:13.399 --> 31:15.033
Um, it's going
really, really well.

31:15.067 --> 31:17.235
Actually, I was thinking about,

31:17.269 --> 31:20.639
um, doing a bunch of these
at college campuses
all over the district.

31:20.673 --> 31:23.608
That sounds interesting.
I'd like to talk more
about that with you.

31:23.643 --> 31:26.678
Why don't you come back
to my apartment later
for a debriefing.

31:30.783 --> 31:33.618
Casey, if you want to
talk about Washington

31:33.653 --> 31:35.220
we should talk
about Washington.

31:35.254 --> 31:37.656
It's OK. I don't think
it's going to be an issue.

31:42.928 --> 31:45.997
So, on behalf of ZBZ,
I'd like you to know

31:46.032 --> 31:48.800
that we would really...
You want to close
the front door?

31:48.834 --> 31:51.002
No, I prefer to leave it open,
if you don't mind.

31:51.037 --> 31:54.472
Great. Anyway,
I would really like it

31:54.507 --> 31:56.207
if you would consider
coming back.

31:56.242 --> 31:58.009
Are you asking for
the house or for you?

31:58.044 --> 32:00.345
For the house.
Definitely the house.

32:00.379 --> 32:04.749
We need you, Dale, and not
some flashy hunkazoid
in a cashmere V-neck.

32:04.784 --> 32:06.885
If you were a chip,
you would be
the crunchy kind

32:06.919 --> 32:08.720
in a plain, honest bag.

32:08.754 --> 32:11.256
I'm saying,
I like your package.

32:15.127 --> 32:16.928
[sighs]

32:16.962 --> 32:20.632
Obviously, there would
have to be some ground rules.

32:20.666 --> 32:22.867
You'd have to take a
sexual harassment seminar

32:22.902 --> 32:24.536
and agree to sign a contract

32:24.570 --> 32:27.272
swearing not to make
any unwanted advances.

32:28.541 --> 32:31.643
I will do that.
So, are we good?

32:31.677 --> 32:33.745
You'll come back
and be our hasher?

32:34.814 --> 32:36.781
[exhales] Let me sleep on it.

32:37.917 --> 32:39.117
Alone.

32:45.091 --> 32:47.892
Ah, this must be
our young Einstein now.

32:47.927 --> 32:51.229
<i>Cartwright,
this is David Fanning
from Engineering Weekly.</i>

32:51.263 --> 32:54.099
- Hello.
- Can't wait to hear all
about this wire of yours

32:54.133 --> 32:55.967
that's going
to change the world.

32:57.036 --> 32:58.103
Can we go off the record?

32:58.137 --> 33:00.672
Well, we haven't gone
on the record yet.

33:00.706 --> 33:02.207
What are you doing, Cartwright?

33:02.241 --> 33:05.243
Dana thinks we may have
found a problem
with our new formula.

33:05.277 --> 33:07.512
That's interesting, and
something we should talk about

33:07.546 --> 33:10.782
after we're interviewed
by a national
science publication.

33:10.816 --> 33:13.885
- Back on the record.
- Off the record.

33:13.919 --> 33:15.553
She thinks we're heading
for a dead end,

33:15.588 --> 33:17.322
which means
a patentable prototype

33:17.356 --> 33:19.858
might not be possible
for years, if at all.

33:19.892 --> 33:22.093
That's ridiculous.
Back on the record.

33:22.128 --> 33:24.129
- Off the record.
- [Dictaphone beeps]

33:24.163 --> 33:25.897
I think she may be right.

33:25.931 --> 33:28.700
I think we should cancel
this interview, tell the dean.

33:28.734 --> 33:31.936
Are you insane?
Opportunities for
recognition like this

33:31.971 --> 33:33.404
come around once in a lifetime,

33:33.439 --> 33:35.240
twice only if you're
very, very lucky.

33:35.274 --> 33:37.142
I'm not about to let
this one pass me by.

33:37.176 --> 33:40.044
I don't understand.
Am I supposed to pretend
that everything's OK

33:40.079 --> 33:43.448
so you can get back at your
ex-partner who screwed you over
20 years ago?

33:43.482 --> 33:45.817
- So you do understand.
- [groans]

33:45.851 --> 33:47.886
Sorry. The brilliant ones
are always a little off.

33:47.920 --> 33:49.487
It's not easy
being the wunderkind.

33:49.522 --> 33:51.456
Oh, please stop
calling me that.

33:53.225 --> 33:56.895
Look, I got this wire
to self-heal,

33:56.929 --> 33:59.164
turn on a light bulb
for five minutes.

33:59.198 --> 34:01.132
So far that's all it does.

34:01.167 --> 34:03.334
Maybe one day it will
change the world,

34:03.369 --> 34:05.103
and I really hope
I'm the one to do that,

34:05.137 --> 34:08.840
but right now,
it just has potential.

34:09.675 --> 34:11.976
Potential, like me, I hope.

34:12.011 --> 34:14.245
So if you don't mind,
I'd rather not do this

34:14.280 --> 34:16.114
because I don't feel
like a genius,

34:16.148 --> 34:19.250
I'm not a wunderkind,
I'm not a wunder-anything.

34:19.284 --> 34:22.853
And in case there's
any way you didn't know,
that's not his hair.

34:25.558 --> 34:27.759
Is that on or off threcord?

34:30.094 --> 34:32.764
- Right.
- [rock music plays]

34:32.797 --> 34:35.033
I've been thinking about
what you'll owe me.

34:35.067 --> 34:38.303
If you become president,
I want ambassadorship
to France...

34:38.337 --> 34:40.505
- ...or a battleship.
- You might have been right

34:40.539 --> 34:43.608
about politics being scummy.
I think Joel hit on me.

34:43.641 --> 34:46.777
He asked me to his place
for a "debriefing."

34:46.812 --> 34:49.414
[groans] That was
my dad's line.

34:49.447 --> 34:51.748
I didn't think Joel
was like that.

34:51.784 --> 34:53.318
Why are all guys
so disappointing?

34:53.351 --> 34:55.520
Damn it, I really
wanted that job.

34:55.554 --> 34:59.257
- Well, if you really
want the job...
- No, uh-uh.

34:59.291 --> 35:00.792
I'm going to get to Washington,

35:00.826 --> 35:02.527
but I'll be damned if
I get there that way.

35:02.561 --> 35:05.530
Shouldn't you be telling
that to the slimeball?

35:05.564 --> 35:07.165
You're right.

35:09.869 --> 35:12.704
Hey. Let me tell you
something, Joel.

35:12.738 --> 35:15.306
Slimeballs like you are
the reason why politics suck.

35:15.341 --> 35:17.809
Everybody's in it
for what they can get.
You know what?

35:17.843 --> 35:19.777
You're not getting me.
I am not having sex
with you.

35:19.812 --> 35:23.147
So are we all still
going back to your apartment
for the debriefing?

35:25.084 --> 35:27.352
Wait, you're going back
to his apartment, too?

35:27.386 --> 35:30.154
All of you?

35:30.189 --> 35:33.725
Please say you're planning
some really weird orgy.

35:39.025 --> 35:40.093
Maybe he thought it was funny.

35:40.127 --> 35:42.128
Yeah, I'm sure he thought
it was hysterical.

35:43.630 --> 35:45.031
- I blame you.
- Me? What did I do?

35:45.065 --> 35:46.766
You're the one
who put it in my head

35:46.800 --> 35:48.534
that everyone in politics
is a slimeball.

35:48.569 --> 35:51.504
- I didn't tell you
to call him one.
- Yes, you did.

35:51.538 --> 35:54.340
Uh, thought you guys
might like a healthy snack,

35:54.375 --> 35:56.509
so I threw together a crudite,

35:56.543 --> 36:00.380
- beef sticks and
Cheesaritos for Cappie.
- Thanks, Daley.

36:00.414 --> 36:02.982
Great, he's back.

36:05.853 --> 36:08.788
I really thought
I had that job.

36:08.822 --> 36:13.292
- Clearly, I don't belong there.
- You know what?

36:13.327 --> 36:16.195
- Yes, you do.
- Well, what am I
supposed to do now?

36:16.230 --> 36:18.064
I'll tell you
what you're gonna do.

36:18.098 --> 36:20.299
You're gonna go talk
to that guy and you're
gonna get that job back.

36:20.334 --> 36:22.235
I can't, I am too humiliated.

36:22.269 --> 36:25.471
You're Casey Cartwright.
You can do anything you want.

36:25.506 --> 36:29.609
That's how I know
you're gonna go to Washington,
and you're gonna be amazing.

36:29.643 --> 36:32.078
OK, even if I could,
what about us?

36:32.112 --> 36:33.846
- What about...
- Graduation?

36:34.848 --> 36:36.282
Oh, my God, he said it.

36:36.316 --> 36:38.951
You'll never leave here.
You love it too much.

36:38.986 --> 36:40.586
That's true, I do love it here.

36:40.621 --> 36:42.288
But I don't think
I could be anywhere

36:42.322 --> 36:43.689
that didn't have you.

36:47.060 --> 36:49.429
- Aww!
- [Cappie] We'll be fine.

36:49.463 --> 36:51.564
So go get that job.

36:51.598 --> 36:54.367
I'd kiss you for luck, but
I've got beef stick breath.

37:10.451 --> 37:12.018
You wanted to see me?

37:22.663 --> 37:25.865
That was quite a little
stunt you pulled.

37:25.899 --> 37:29.802
When the dean heard
about it, he wanted to
have us both expelled...

37:29.837 --> 37:31.304
from the country!

37:31.338 --> 37:34.106
Fortunately, I reminded him
that I have tenure,

37:34.141 --> 37:35.975
and that you're the
Gary Wyatt Grant winner,

37:36.009 --> 37:38.711
so we're both safe.
For now.

37:40.214 --> 37:41.514
Thanks.

37:41.548 --> 37:44.350
I realize that
my first impression
was right about you.

37:44.384 --> 37:47.119
- What was that?
- That you lack drive, ambition.

37:47.154 --> 37:49.121
It isn't just about
the science, you know.

37:49.156 --> 37:51.524
You're never gonna
get anywhere with that
"aww, shucks" attitude.

37:51.558 --> 37:55.862
Trust me, nobody's
gonna toot your horn if
you can't do it yourself.

37:55.896 --> 37:59.465
Maybe you're right.
I just couldn't pretend
I deserve it.

37:59.500 --> 38:02.034
I hope I'll get another chance
when the time is right.

38:02.069 --> 38:04.504
But if I don't, I'm not gonna
let it rule my life.

38:20.087 --> 38:23.422
Try reversing the polarity
on the capacitors.

38:24.424 --> 38:25.691
Excuse me?

38:35.369 --> 38:38.070
- Casey?
- I just want you
to know how sorry I am

38:38.105 --> 38:40.039
about the misunderstanding
last night, really sorry.

38:40.073 --> 38:42.441
If there's any way you could
forget that it happened,

38:42.476 --> 38:45.177
that'd be great. And I hope
you'll still consider me

38:45.212 --> 38:47.713
for a legislative aide job
in Washington,

38:47.748 --> 38:49.582
because I know that
I would be great at it.

38:49.616 --> 38:52.585
But I am sorry.
I already said that,
but I am sorry.

38:52.619 --> 38:57.957
First off... there's
no need to apologize.
I should have been clearer.

38:59.326 --> 39:03.129
And I think there may have been
another misunderstanding.

39:03.163 --> 39:05.698
You were never
gonna be considered for
a legislative aide job.

39:05.732 --> 39:09.869
- Oh.
- You're an incredibly smart
and resourceful person,

39:09.903 --> 39:12.271
and someday you're gonna
do great in Washington.

39:12.306 --> 39:15.474
But we mostly hire people
with postgraduate degrees
for those jobs.

39:15.509 --> 39:18.444
With a bachelor's degree
you could maybe
cover the phones

39:18.478 --> 39:22.348
- or answer constituent
correspondence...
- But I want to do more.

39:22.382 --> 39:25.451
Then you're gonna need
more experience
or more education,

39:25.485 --> 39:28.354
maybe in local government.

39:28.388 --> 39:30.957
Have you thought about
graduate school?
What about law school?

39:30.991 --> 39:34.627
I thought about law school,
but it was kind of
for a boyfriend, though.

39:34.661 --> 39:37.964
Well, maybe you should really
consider it for yourself.

39:37.998 --> 39:41.267
I will. Um, thanks.

39:41.301 --> 39:44.437
I still know some people
in law school here.

39:44.471 --> 39:48.741
Deadlines are coming up,
so if you decide to apply
and want some help...

39:48.775 --> 39:52.311
- And that is not
a come-on, by the way.
- [laughs]

39:52.346 --> 39:57.450
Thanks. I'd welcome that.
The help, not the come-on.

39:58.919 --> 39:59.919
OK.

40:07.194 --> 40:09.395
So, you really botched it
with the dean, huh?

40:09.429 --> 40:10.863
You heard about that?

40:10.897 --> 40:13.199
Nerd Twitter's
all atwitter about it.

40:15.035 --> 40:17.870
So I guess
now the pressure's off,
you don't need me anymore?

40:17.904 --> 40:21.741
Actually, I'd really
like you to stay.
I mean, if you want.

40:21.775 --> 40:25.344
I read your notes.
I think you were right
about the dead end.

40:25.379 --> 40:28.681
And if I'm going to have
to work up a new formula,

40:28.715 --> 40:30.683
I could really use your help.

40:30.717 --> 40:32.652
Maybe you're not
as big of a jerk
as I thought you were.

40:32.686 --> 40:35.321
- Thanks.
- I said "maybe."

40:35.355 --> 40:38.758
Um, OK, so where do we start?

40:38.792 --> 40:41.894
Professor Hastings
thinks we should try
reversing the polarity

40:41.928 --> 40:45.031
- on the capacitors.
- He's probably right.

40:46.400 --> 40:47.900
Oh, hand me that cooling fan.

40:59.279 --> 41:01.480
<i>[video game beeping]</i>

41:03.083 --> 41:07.253
Oh, it's over? [sighs]
I can't believe I missed
the whole turtle race.

41:07.287 --> 41:10.656
Relax, Spitter,
I believe there's still
a straggler or two.

41:10.691 --> 41:13.492
Oh, hey, how did your,
um, interview go?

41:13.527 --> 41:15.961
- When is the magazine
coming out?
- That's not gonna happen.

41:15.996 --> 41:18.698
Not yet. I decided
that when it does happen,

41:18.732 --> 41:20.499
I want it to be the right way.

41:20.534 --> 41:24.704
Well, I've made a decision, too.
I'm gonna go to law school.

41:24.738 --> 41:26.706
That's great, Case.

41:26.740 --> 41:29.642
And I've made a pretty
big decision myself.

41:31.011 --> 41:32.011
Check this out.

41:33.547 --> 41:35.848
This is a form
for declaring a major.

41:37.350 --> 41:40.019
Oh, my God,
you declared a major?

41:40.053 --> 41:41.954
That's amazing.

41:41.988 --> 41:45.357
- Wait, this is blank.
- Well, baby steps, Russ.

41:45.392 --> 41:48.627
You know what they say
about slow and steady.

41:54.101 --> 41:57.369
And it's down to the wire!
No telling how this one
will end.

41:57.404 --> 42:02.708
And... Earnhardt takes
the checkered flag! Whoo!
