WEBVTT

00:09.296 --> 00:11.092
I cannot square
the man that I married

00:11.122 --> 00:12.733
with everything
that I've learned.

00:12.763 --> 00:15.902
Does the name Jakob Negrescu
mean anything to you?

00:17.152 --> 00:20.022
Elena, who is she?
No, it...

00:21.659 --> 00:24.388
They were laundering money
on a massive scale

00:25.701 --> 00:26.916
and I was helping them.

00:27.268 --> 00:28.536
He says he won't see you.

00:33.061 --> 00:35.631
I found him.
I found John Brandeis.

00:36.247 --> 00:38.853
No one fucks me over. No one.

00:39.426 --> 00:41.996
Georgina Clios, you're under arrest.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:50.993 --> 00:53.021
I know what you're trying to do!

01:06.415 --> 01:10.429
Stop It! Stop It!
Stop It! Stop It!

01:25.406 --> 01:29.068
<i>You and I are cut from the same ice</i>

01:29.223 --> 01:32.871
<i>Sincerity made us the perfect heist</i>

01:33.035 --> 01:36.711
<i>Burning all the gold to sapphire skies</i>

01:36.741 --> 01:40.345
<i>But the breeze is cold in paradise</i>

01:40.375 --> 01:44.171
<i>I can feel the whispers in the street</i>

01:44.201 --> 01:47.532
<i>Every night I shiver in my sleep</i>

01:47.562 --> 01:53.983
<i>No reality, cause it's all a dream</i>

01:54.993 --> 01:58.698
<i>Was it love? It was wild
Brought me to my knees</i>

01:58.728 --> 02:02.106
<i>Sparking fires,
sparring wars with expensive things</i>

02:02.136 --> 02:05.833
<i>I tiptoe right round my baby</i>

02:05.863 --> 02:09.622
<i>All this world is mad, mad crazy</i>

02:10.025 --> 02:13.800
<i>Was it love? It was wild
Brought me to my knees</i>

02:13.830 --> 02:17.138
<i>Sparking fires,
sparring wars with expensive things</i>

02:17.168 --> 02:20.724
<i>I tiptoe right round my baby</i>

02:20.754 --> 02:24.767
<i>All this world is mad, mad crazy</i>

02:31.081 --> 02:32.659
Cold night.

02:33.490 --> 02:36.729
Localized power cut, I'm afraid.
Sorry about that.

02:38.489 --> 02:40.841
Seems there was a
bureaucratic oversight

02:40.871 --> 02:44.531
and they forgot to return your
clothes after you were searched.

02:47.137 --> 02:48.066
Here we are.

02:50.660 --> 02:52.632
Can I ask someone to fetch you a coffee

02:58.874 --> 03:00.944
or do you want to phone
your family, of course?

03:15.529 --> 03:16.543
Adam!
Hello?

03:20.103 --> 03:22.877
Irina.
Yes, Georgina.

03:23.441 --> 03:25.596
Everything alright?
I've been arrested.

03:26.525 --> 03:28.215
Darling, what a nightmare.

03:28.941 --> 03:31.181
It was Jukes.
I can't get a hold of my lawyer.

03:31.211 --> 03:34.012
I've been here all night.
I'll get a lawyer down there right away.

03:34.042 --> 03:34.955
The very best!

03:35.702 --> 03:36.871
Stay strong.

03:42.051 --> 03:42.910
What's gong on?

03:42.940 --> 03:45.065
Jukes arrested Georgina.
What?

03:45.417 --> 03:47.192
She spent last night in a cell.

03:47.222 --> 03:48.854
We need to
get down to the Station.

03:49.046 --> 03:50.807
that will only
make things worse.

03:51.525 --> 03:54.145
I'll arrange for representation.
Anyway...

03:54.736 --> 03:56.314
I promised to see Christos.

03:56.344 --> 03:59.355
Go see Christos, if you want.
I'm going to the station.

04:01.073 --> 04:04.073
Constantine's off-book
art market transactions

04:04.103 --> 04:07.524
all involve Brandeis.
Now we have bank statements

04:07.554 --> 04:10.355
It's building to a strong case.
Against Brandeis, perhaps.

04:10.385 --> 04:11.439
Not enough to charge her.

04:11.469 --> 04:13.707
I haven't interrogated her yet.
You will not, Jukes.

04:14.341 --> 04:16.594
Put your efforts
into catching Brandeis.

04:16.624 --> 04:19.827
but you can't go after people like
her just because they piss you off.

04:20.237 --> 04:21.349
A strip search?

04:22.237 --> 04:23.237
For fraud?

04:23.267 --> 04:25.561
It was all done perfectly
correctly by a female officer.

04:25.591 --> 04:26.992
And playing games in the night?

04:27.711 --> 04:30.359
Yes, I've heard.
She could sue us for that.

04:30.389 --> 04:32.253
Look, she's tired,
she's strung out.

04:32.283 --> 04:34.225
If I talk to her now...
Let her go!

04:34.732 --> 04:36.225
And walk carefully, Jukes.

04:36.777 --> 04:40.101
Remember, you have no authority
here without my approval.

04:43.017 --> 04:44.195
What's going on?
Madame Clios...

04:44.225 --> 04:46.237
Madame Clios!
What's going on?

04:56.976 --> 04:57.709
Let's go.

05:03.272 --> 05:04.258
Are you alright?

05:08.194 --> 05:09.701
I came as soon as I heard.

05:12.208 --> 05:13.068
You're out now.

05:14.068 --> 05:15.293
That's the important thing.

05:16.813 --> 05:17.404
Yeah.

05:22.686 --> 05:24.249
They arrested her, can you believe it?

05:25.172 --> 05:27.763
I wonder if she's out yet?
Who did you call in?

05:27.793 --> 05:29.749
No one!
No one?

05:30.067 --> 05:31.616
I was getting around to it.

05:32.736 --> 05:35.637
Of course, it's possible
they do have something on her.

05:37.031 --> 05:41.809
No one must really know how involved
she was in Constantine's business.

05:41.955 --> 05:43.251
She's one of us.

05:44.406 --> 05:45.054
Really?

05:47.087 --> 05:47.932
Listen...

05:50.805 --> 05:55.087
I know I was a pain last time
you visited and I'm sorry.

05:55.117 --> 05:57.460
I was going
through a hard time but

05:58.643 --> 05:59.418
it's better now.

06:01.094 --> 06:03.488
And besides, there's someone
here who's really helpful.

06:04.861 --> 06:06.847
Who?
Just a friend.

06:07.072 --> 06:08.058
Yeah, right.

06:09.298 --> 06:11.312
That's wonderful, of course.

06:14.516 --> 06:15.431
Feeling better?

06:20.108 --> 06:22.643
Do you know what I was
thinking about in that cell?

06:23.749 --> 06:24.369
No.

06:25.129 --> 06:25.960
My father.

06:28.861 --> 06:30.129
He ripped people of

06:30.876 --> 06:32.016
a thousand ways

06:32.763 --> 06:34.073
and I was a part of the con.

06:34.786 --> 06:35.744
He used me.

06:37.124 --> 06:39.279
It made him seem more wholesome
to have a little girl.

06:41.054 --> 06:42.617
I came all the way to Europe
to get away from him.

06:45.902 --> 06:49.042
But there I was,
sitting in a jail cell,

06:51.240 --> 06:52.127
just like him.

06:52.859 --> 06:54.550
He should never
have done that to you.

06:54.580 --> 06:55.421
Jukes?

06:57.745 --> 06:59.139
This one's on Constantine.

07:00.435 --> 07:03.322
Constantine did this to me.
He did it to all of us.

07:03.900 --> 07:04.463
Anyway...

07:07.732 --> 07:09.282
Well, I'm going to
do something about it.

07:14.620 --> 07:15.634
Thanks for the tea.

07:16.366 --> 07:19.084
Where are you going?
I'm going to get some answers.

07:38.490 --> 07:40.955
Hey, Georgie! Do you want to co...

07:42.504 --> 07:43.194
The vault

07:44.025 --> 07:46.447
That statement wasn't there
before yesterday. You planted it.

07:47.177 --> 07:49.431
Yes, there was a good reason.

07:49.741 --> 07:51.008
You wanted to get me arrested

07:51.755 --> 07:53.008
and take my paintings.

07:53.038 --> 07:55.121
I know it looks bad but
it wasn't like that.

07:55.544 --> 07:56.163
Ok.

07:57.037 --> 07:57.966
So, where are they?

07:59.211 --> 08:01.042
Remember,
I know what you do, Robert.

08:02.155 --> 08:03.775
Why don't you come inside
and I'll show you.

08:10.310 --> 08:12.944
When I heard about the warrant,
I knew I had to do something about

08:12.974 --> 08:14.423
the Brandeis paintings.

08:15.761 --> 08:16.817
You switched them.

08:17.493 --> 08:18.718
No, not quite.

08:21.245 --> 08:22.654
There wasn't much time.

08:23.823 --> 08:27.175
I didn't want t,
pin them too securely.

08:28.900 --> 08:32.054
in case I damage
the paintings underneath.

08:33.379 --> 08:35.619
But I needed to
throw them off your scent

08:36.948 --> 08:40.879
and so, I left the bank
statements as a smoking gun,

08:42.731 --> 08:44.929
so that they wouldn't look at the

08:45.717 --> 08:47.055
paintings

08:47.802 --> 08:48.746
too closely.

08:52.077 --> 08:53.162
Your Sheila

08:55.739 --> 08:57.782
I couldn't just walk out
of the vault with them,

08:57.812 --> 08:59.444
so I decided to

09:00.556 --> 09:01.711
hide them.

09:02.902 --> 09:03.578
You see,

09:05.339 --> 09:07.973
I was trying to
lay a trail to Brandeis

09:09.198 --> 09:12.466
and shift attention
away from you.

09:21.333 --> 09:22.361
that was smart..

09:24.624 --> 09:25.370
and it worked,

09:26.398 --> 09:29.722
So, do you think
you can trust me again?

09:40.406 --> 09:41.420
I'm sorry.

09:42.730 --> 09:43.772
It was a bad night.

09:46.005 --> 09:46.582
You...

09:46.892 --> 09:49.498
have no idea ho
humiliating that was for me.

09:50.329 --> 09:51.709
I'm sorry, Georgie.

09:52.012 --> 09:54.519
Didn't think Jukes would arrest yo.
Had no idea he'd go that far.

09:54.549 --> 09:57.273
if we don't stop him, that's going
to be the next few years of my life.

09:57.303 --> 09:58.273
What do you want to do?

09:58.893 --> 10:00.090
The only way
to get me out of this mess

10:00.120 --> 10:01.921
is to make sure that
Brandeis takes the fall.

10:02.895 --> 10:05.628
So, we make him real.
But then what?

10:36.641 --> 10:37.712
Is that going to work?

10:38.810 --> 10:39.740
Yes, listen...

10:40.106 --> 10:42.416
If Brandeis donates a painting,
it will cause a stir

10:42.789 --> 10:46.014
Art world recluse
turns up to gallery unveiling.

10:46.044 --> 10:48.719
It'll be all over the papers.
Jukes sees his photo,

10:49.202 --> 10:51.442
is on his trail
and leaves us alone.

10:51.780 --> 10:54.738
Are you sure you want to
sacrifice the Sheila to the cause?

10:54.768 --> 10:56.794
It's a lot of money to lose.
It's worth millions.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.512
I could help you sell it.
Robert, breathe!

10:59.491 --> 11:00.336
It'll be worth it.

11:00.366 --> 11:01.533
Well, what about
one of the other works?

11:01.563 --> 11:03.026
No. it had to be that one.

11:03.056 --> 11:05.829
I know that Sonia Roche is dying
to get her hands on a Sheila.

11:06.188 --> 11:06.780
Alright.

11:08.714 --> 11:09.743
Do you speak Italian?

11:10.489 --> 11:13.123
I'm afraid I don't.
Then let's hope he speaks French

11:14.545 --> 11:18.109
Let's use the Hotel King Phillipe.
Oh, he'll love that!

11:19.053 --> 11:19.983
Monsieur Luigi...

11:49.035 --> 11:50.261
Hello.
Hi.

11:55.240 --> 11:58.845
Well, actually, Sonia, Mr. Brandeis
is a great admirer of the work you're

12:02.542 --> 12:05.880
We would consider that an
extraordinarily generous gesture.

12:06.458 --> 12:07.387
Sixteen.

12:14.676 --> 12:15.550
Follow me.

12:22.184 --> 12:24.367
You'll forgive the formality,
Robert, but

12:24.691 --> 12:26.508
you never can tell these days.

12:43.356 --> 12:48.314
Between you and me, Sonia, Mr. Brandeis
is looking to get a bit more recognition

12:48.344 --> 12:49.540
for his philanthropy.

12:49.723 --> 12:52.455
A public unveiling would be perfect.

12:52.485 --> 12:54.822
I'd be happy to discuss
that with him directly.

12:55.329 --> 12:58.653
Mr. Brandeis has designated me
his intermediary.

13:00.678 --> 13:01.537
Sophie...

13:06.438 --> 13:09.128
Pardon me for being blunt, Robert,

13:09.158 --> 13:12.586
but you're a fringe operator
with a certain reputation.

13:13.093 --> 13:16.727
I wouldn't invite you to a party.
Why would Brandeis?

13:16.757 --> 13:18.713
He has his peculiarities.

13:20.707 --> 13:22.143
I have to warn you Sonia,

13:22.173 --> 13:25.664
Mr. Brandeis has attached 2
requirements to the donation.

13:26.538 --> 13:29.650
I am one and the other...

13:29.872 --> 13:33.901
is that the unveiling needs
to happen tomorrow afternoon.

13:37.070 --> 13:40.309
And I'm afraid it's
take it or leave it.

13:48.327 --> 13:49.130
How'd it go?

13:50.905 --> 13:51.651
She nibbled,

13:52.844 --> 13:54.210
just as you predicted.

14:01.889 --> 14:04.199
You still coming out
to this old place?

14:05.354 --> 14:07.481
Why, it's happy memories, of course.

14:10.678 --> 14:12.016
Constantine hated it.

14:13.038 --> 14:14.291
It belonged to me parents.

14:14.925 --> 14:16.179
They didn't come from money.

14:17.404 --> 14:19.136
I used to love it as a child.

14:19.770 --> 14:21.587
Constantine never
could understand it.

14:21.929 --> 14:23.493
I suppose some small part of me

14:23.523 --> 14:26.140
wanted to hold onto
what life was like before him.

14:27.281 --> 14:30.042
Is that why you
used to bring me here?

14:30.267 --> 14:32.493
Perhaps you reminded me
of life before him too.

14:35.650 --> 14:39.242
An old house, that's me now.
You've gone up in the world.

14:39.622 --> 14:41.186
Well, not as much as you.

14:42.164 --> 14:44.756
I'm rapidly falling back to nothing.
Come on.

14:44.786 --> 14:47.277
It's true. The kids,
they don't need me anymore

14:48.234 --> 14:52.080
Only thing in my life that's
always here for me is this place.

14:52.250 --> 14:55.403
You're in a self-pity
that struggles with you.

14:55.558 --> 14:58.910
You should do something. You
should get the Villa Carmella back.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.516
Oh, you think it's that simple?

15:00.762 --> 15:04.452
She'll never give it back. Not the
villa, not the art, not my daughter.

15:05.030 --> 15:07.255
Why do you invite me here,
now, truly?

15:08.480 --> 15:10.016
Why am I here?

15:11.034 --> 15:12.541
I never brought Adriana here.

15:13.794 --> 15:14.724
Do you know why?

15:16.597 --> 15:17.062
No.

15:18.315 --> 15:19.963
I think she was conceived upstairs.

15:24.773 --> 15:25.717
Adriana?

15:30.879 --> 15:32.414
I want my life back.

15:35.118 --> 15:36.034
You have to help me.

15:58.049 --> 16:00.049
Alright, see you later.
Sonia!

16:00.936 --> 16:01.598
Hi, Sonia.

16:03.651 --> 16:04.510
I knew you'd come.

16:12.285 --> 16:13.468
Jukes.
Anderton.

16:13.735 --> 16:16.073
Looks like Brandeis is
in town at Gallery Roche.

16:17.285 --> 16:20.186
He's unveiling a donation,
some sort of impromptu thing.

16:20.383 --> 16:23.116
My invitation arrived this morning.
I'm here now.

16:23.501 --> 16:24.233
Right.

16:43.407 --> 16:44.013
Madame Roche...

16:45.182 --> 16:49.069
Mr. Brandeis, such
a pleasure to meet you

16:49.099 --> 16:52.154
and to be able to thank you
for your wonderful donation.

16:52.195 --> 16:53.180
Christophe, here!

16:53.490 --> 16:54.194
May I?

16:57.081 --> 16:57.912
Smile.

17:07.397 --> 17:08.778
This is who I want.

17:10.791 --> 17:13.511
I present... Sheila.

17:14.117 --> 17:16.159
Such expressive use of the line!

17:16.990 --> 17:19.609
It's absolutely perfect in the space.
Would you agree?

17:47.985 --> 17:51.098
Georgina! Oh, darling!

17:53.217 --> 17:56.119
Oh, it's so good to see you
back in the thick of things again.

17:56.302 --> 17:58.513
Absolutely awful what happened...

17:58.921 --> 18:01.189
Outrageous to take your collection.

18:01.576 --> 18:03.942
Unbelievable what
you're going through!

18:04.562 --> 18:05.154
Thank you.

18:06.478 --> 18:08.604
If there is anything at all
that I can do...

18:08.823 --> 18:09.555
Shit!

18:09.710 --> 18:10.837
Are you alright?

18:12.626 --> 18:14.654
Excuse me, gentlemen,
it's time to go.

18:14.915 --> 18:16.323
Sorry?
Now, yes, now

18:17.534 --> 18:19.858
Robert, what are you doing?
I'm sorry but I was just...

18:19.888 --> 18:22.732
Get Carlsson out the side entrance
and see if you can delay Jukes.

18:22.762 --> 18:24.718
Police! Quiet, everyone!

18:26.306 --> 18:29.855
Silence!
John Brandeis!

18:30.714 --> 18:33.320
I'm looking for John Brandeis!
(Lucas, it's Robert. They're on their way

18:34.151 --> 18:35.559
We know he's here.

18:36.325 --> 18:37.818
Brandeis!

18:38.198 --> 18:40.733
Then I will take the name, address

18:40.763 --> 18:43.367
and identification of
everyone in this room.

18:48.697 --> 18:50.584
Alain, downstairs.
Upstairs!

18:58.889 --> 19:00.748
Get that camera out of my face!

19:00.778 --> 19:03.005
This is what I sell.
Later

19:03.035 --> 19:04.907
Yes, where, where?

19:08.233 --> 19:10.463
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

19:11.381 --> 19:12.119
Hold this.

19:35.214 --> 19:35.656
Wait!

19:43.706 --> 19:44.148
Let's go!

19:47.706 --> 19:48.870
Alright, alright!

19:50.766 --> 19:52.552
Move! Here we go.

20:08.338 --> 20:09.797
You don't have a light, do you?

20:09.977 --> 20:12.141
What the hell do
you think you're doing?

20:12.171 --> 20:13.387
Brandeis!

20:14.001 --> 20:15.805
John Brandeis!

20:15.835 --> 20:17.805
He donated the Sheila painting.
Where is he?

20:17.835 --> 20:19.608
Mr. Brandeis? He isn't here.

20:19.772 --> 20:20.788
Apparently not.

20:20.818 --> 20:23.739
Then, I think we
can assume he has left.

20:30.083 --> 20:31.665
Oh, Madame Clios!

20:32.911 --> 20:34.616
Meet with Brandeis, did you?

20:35.420 --> 20:38.732
I came to an unveiling,
just like everyone else.

20:38.762 --> 20:40.518
Well, I was invited.

20:40.879 --> 20:44.059
Oh, are you Anderton's plus one?
That's sweet.

20:44.415 --> 20:47.153
He;s checking the provenance
of your collection for me.

20:47.817 --> 20:48.341
Boss?

20:50.770 --> 20:53.557
We tracked him to Hotel King Phillipe.
Good work.

20:55.048 --> 20:59.164
Squad, with me! He's not here.
Let's go! Let's go!

21:02.410 --> 21:04.000
You could stay for a drink.

21:20.352 --> 21:22.794
Ah, Gaspardi Litvinov.

21:22.975 --> 21:25.909
Looking for a private game?
As it happens,

21:26.237 --> 21:27.712
I'm here to do business.

21:35.514 --> 21:37.087
There is something I want

21:39.060 --> 21:40.682
and I think you
can get it for me.

21:45.207 --> 21:45.764
What is it?

21:46.846 --> 21:47.355
Elena.

21:48.396 --> 21:50.101
Constantine Clios' hard drive.

21:50.131 --> 21:54.248
It contains sensitive information but
now it is locked up in a police station.

21:57.691 --> 22:01.036
I have my own problems
with the police right now.

22:03.806 --> 22:04.462
Delormes?

22:06.380 --> 22:08.429
You're well informed, my friend.

22:13.713 --> 22:17.927
Perhaps together, we can
resolve my problem and yours.

22:38.603 --> 22:39.308
Excuse me...

22:40.521 --> 22:41.049
Monsieur?

22:41.079 --> 22:44.308
Officer Jukes, Interpol.
Mr. John Brandeis, please.

22:44.652 --> 22:48.333
Mr. Brandeis, Mr. John Brandeis!
Open the door!

22:51.029 --> 22:52.931
Police, don't move!
Police, don't...

23:27.320 --> 23:27.926
Boss...

23:28.664 --> 23:29.664
Come and look at this.

23:31.582 --> 23:34.303
Brazil! Call the airport, now!
Yes, sir.

23:38.751 --> 23:41.570
Hello. Miss, I would like to check on
an outbound flight for...

23:41.600 --> 23:44.324
Monsieur, no telephone calls.
Thank you.

23:50.558 --> 23:51.705
There you are.

23:53.427 --> 23:56.312
They're saying the flight left
on schedule, 45 minutes ago.

23:56.492 --> 23:57.345
Looks like he's gone.

23:59.404 --> 24:00.027
Shit!

24:06.584 --> 24:08.256
Good Lord?
Uh-huh.

24:12.989 --> 24:14.316
Yeah, uh-huh...

24:17.767 --> 24:19.603
Great. So...

24:20.013 --> 24:21.701
He made his flight.

24:23.259 --> 24:24.373
The, we did it.

24:34.765 --> 24:36.224
I wonder what he's thinking.

24:38.406 --> 24:40.767
How he managed to
get away with it for so long.

24:46.832 --> 24:48.717
What are you doing in here, anyway?

24:51.129 --> 24:53.949
i thought since the room wasn't
being used anymore, I could...

24:54.621 --> 24:55.703
take it over.

24:56.104 --> 24:57.399
Make it my book again.

24:59.367 --> 25:03.596
Problem is, I'm not sure I can work
with him disapproving over my shoulder.

25:08.346 --> 25:09.542
Then, he goes.

25:12.673 --> 25:13.641
Are you sure?

25:16.042 --> 25:16.747
Yeah.

25:36.582 --> 25:38.474
Here!
Yes, I've seen it.

25:38.504 --> 25:40.319
What the fuck you
think you were doing?

25:40.349 --> 25:42.763
Storming like that
into a gallery as if it was some

25:42.793 --> 25:45.189
terror cell.
I had reason to believe...

25:45.219 --> 25:47.403
You overreached yourself.

25:47.433 --> 25:48.570
Got me that close!

25:48.600 --> 25:50.446
There is no extradition
where Brandeis went.

25:50.476 --> 25:52.051
So we talk to the Brazilians.

25:52.081 --> 25:54.085
It's over, Jukes.

25:54.416 --> 25:57.018
If you want to keep investigating
Constantine Clios,

25:57.048 --> 26:00.282
you better find another angle
or find another job.

26:15.657 --> 26:16.161
Boss?

26:18.858 --> 26:20.892
Call Georgina Clios.
Yeah.

26:48.561 --> 26:52.251
Hello?
Hey, Adriana, good morning.

26:52.281 --> 26:54.051
Jakob!
Yes, it's me.

26:54.430 --> 26:56.795
I haven't seen you since the gala.
Mm-hm.

26:57.867 --> 26:59.870
Would you like to come to my club tonight?

28:09.080 --> 28:09.585
What?

30:06.947 --> 30:07.863
Oh, shit!

30:22.711 --> 30:23.738
What's that?

30:24.747 --> 30:27.097
That's my Mom's when
she married my Dad.

30:27.317 --> 30:29.383
Oh, no! Try it on!

30:29.777 --> 30:32.361
Oh, I can't! She'll come up.
Come on, Adriana!

30:33.190 --> 30:35.019
I bet you look great in this.

30:36.309 --> 30:37.507
Sophie, no!

30:40.188 --> 30:41.150
Come on, do it.

30:49.996 --> 30:51.525
Ok, honey.

30:52.992 --> 30:53.433
Wait...

30:54.031 --> 30:55.182
Come on.

30:58.414 --> 31:01.016
Ok, what are we doing tonight?

31:01.174 --> 31:02.971
I want to have some fun.

31:03.001 --> 31:06.454
Well there's somewhere
I think I can get us into.

31:06.484 --> 31:08.819
Yeah?
Special invitations.

31:09.627 --> 31:11.740
And it's this older guy's place.

31:12.386 --> 31:14.231
Insane there.
What older guy?

31:14.261 --> 31:18.142
You'll meet him. It'll be fun.
Yeah, it better be.

31:20.347 --> 31:21.120
Ok.

31:36.828 --> 31:37.600
Mum?

31:39.967 --> 31:41.039
What are you doing?

31:42.442 --> 31:44.760
I'm sorry, we were
just messing around...

31:44.790 --> 31:45.722
It was my fault, ma'am

31:45.752 --> 31:47.425
Clio...
No, I wanted to put it on.

31:47.455 --> 31:48.687
Sophie's being loyal.

31:51.627 --> 31:52.573
Do I look like you?

31:53.799 --> 31:56.165
I mean when you married Dad.

31:58.908 --> 32:00.864
Yes, very young.

34:13.641 --> 34:14.699
You played me.

34:15.297 --> 34:16.922
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

34:18.089 --> 34:20.817
I was meant to go charging
into the Gallery, wasn't I?

34:21.463 --> 34:23.228
And Brandeis, what,

34:23.764 --> 34:25.813
sneaks out the back into a waiting car,

34:26.571 --> 34:28.525
leaves the country
with a false passport

34:28.857 --> 34:30.623
and flies straight back
with a real one?

34:31.585 --> 34:33.114
Oh, wow!

34:33.596 --> 34:37.128
You must be imagining him
sitting in some cafe in Nice,

34:37.158 --> 34:39.935
Laughing his ass off, reading
about your fuckup in the paper.

34:41.306 --> 34:43.341
You know about
the false passport, then.

34:43.371 --> 34:44.540
Just a guess.

34:46.322 --> 34:49.902
I suppose i shouldn't be
surprised, given your origins.

34:52.172 --> 34:54.554
The investigation into the bank
will be ongoing.

34:55.373 --> 34:56.382
Anything else?

34:59.820 --> 35:03.400
We've decided not to pursue charges
against you for the time being.

35:03.430 --> 35:06.880
Although, if any
fresh evidence presents itself...

35:09.040 --> 35:09.845
you can go.

35:14.607 --> 35:16.736
What is it?
The collection...

35:17.414 --> 35:19.858
my paintings...
I want them returned...

35:20.946 --> 35:23.375
In due course.
immediately!

35:24.952 --> 35:25.645
Or...

35:26.403 --> 35:29.257
Perhaps, you rather
I sue for mistreatment.

35:34.492 --> 35:36.952
you can keep the Lorraine.
It's a fake, anyway.

35:37.898 --> 35:39.933
Brandeis screwed us too.
What?

35:40.721 --> 35:41.998
Didn't Jeffrey notice?

35:43.954 --> 35:45.735
He always did have a terrible eye.

35:47.011 --> 35:48.667
Hang it on your wall, if you like.

35:49.770 --> 35:51.663
It will be returned,
along with the rest.

35:52.971 --> 35:55.920
Fine, now you can go.

36:18.373 --> 36:20.250
God, I thought you said
it wouldn't be a problem.

36:20.486 --> 36:22.931
I'm trying. I texted him.
He hasn't answered yet.

36:23.921 --> 36:25.704
Ok, we should go and
find Dominic instead.

36:25.734 --> 36:27.596
No, I'll tweet him
that we're here.

36:32.924 --> 36:33.996
Adriana!

37:25.616 --> 37:28.691
Well, actually, your mother has
forbidden me from seeing you, so

37:30.116 --> 37:33.143
Oh, you know how she's
just overprotective sometimes.

37:33.853 --> 37:35.098
And besides,

37:35.256 --> 37:36.943
I'm old enough to handle myself.

37:36.973 --> 37:38.016
So I see.

37:40.548 --> 37:42.425
Anything you want, you ask.

37:43.197 --> 37:43.923
Anything.
Thanks.

37:45.752 --> 37:48.133
Any thing we want.

37:48.163 --> 37:51.458
Shut up, ok? He's your genie.
Genie?

37:51.488 --> 37:53.901
Grants you a wish and all
you have to do his rub his lamp.

37:53.931 --> 37:55.872
I told you, it's not like that.
Uh-huh.

37:57.699 --> 37:58.646
Oh, thanks.

38:05.016 --> 38:06.041
Is something up?

38:06.817 --> 38:09.860
No, just thought you
might want to celebrate.

38:10.160 --> 38:11.311
Come on in!

38:48.356 --> 38:50.169
We should take Leflic
for a ride more often.

38:50.199 --> 38:51.683
We absolutely should.

38:51.713 --> 38:54.112
To Leflique
Leflique!

38:55.954 --> 38:58.162
Are we ok?
What do you mean?

38:58.192 --> 38:59.423
I mean...

39:00.307 --> 39:02.814
are we ok.
Yeah, of course we are.

39:03.003 --> 39:04.901
We didn't even toast
to Jukes, the bastard.

39:04.931 --> 39:05.942
the bastard.

39:05.972 --> 39:08.197
Wish I could have seen his face.
And...

39:08.227 --> 39:11.915
to Egon Sheila.
And his expressive use of line.

39:15.965 --> 39:18.898
She...
Mm. Adam!

39:19.214 --> 39:23.235
Celebrating something?
Oh, every day's an escapade.

39:23.440 --> 39:26.357
I think I mentioned Robert before.
We met at the Institute.

39:27.646 --> 39:29.365
Pleased to meet you.
Yes, you too.

39:29.395 --> 39:33.039
Georgina has mentioned you, I think.
Come, join us!

39:38.058 --> 39:39.887
Well, it's getting late, so

39:39.917 --> 39:44.270
I thought maybe I should be heading off.
Oh, ok.

39:45.940 --> 39:48.842
Ah, nice to meet you.
Good night, Georgie.

39:49.945 --> 39:51.869
You both have a great night.

40:38.581 --> 40:40.221
What the fuck, man!
Stop!

40:55.745 --> 40:58.496
Sophie, we have to go now.
He's being a fucking asshole, right?

40:58.526 --> 41:00.326
He deserved to be thrown out.

41:00.767 --> 41:02.423
It's our night.
Don't let him ruin it.

41:02.818 --> 41:05.026
Oui, oui, passport!

41:22.341 --> 41:23.855
Little fuck.

41:31.891 --> 41:35.077
I can't believe he's out of my life.

41:35.707 --> 41:36.527
Dad?

41:37.284 --> 41:38.246
No,

41:39.492 --> 41:40.328
Jukes.

41:42.670 --> 41:43.269
Well...

41:48.961 --> 41:50.696
I've got something I've gotta do.

41:53.294 --> 41:54.745
Georgina!
Yeah?

41:55.186 --> 41:56.826
When the book's done,

41:57.520 --> 41:58.939
I'm going to dedicate it to you.

43:44.897 --> 43:48.398
<i>Was it love? It was wild
Brought me to my knees</i>

43:48.428 --> 43:51.993
