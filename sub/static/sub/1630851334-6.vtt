WEBVTT

00:28.737 --> 00:29.863
Go away.

00:47.797 --> 00:49.299
What should we do?

00:50.258 --> 00:51.718
Begin the next game.

00:57.891 --> 00:58.975
Sir, let me help.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.372
Thanks so much.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.167
You look great, sir.

01:28.254 --> 01:31.758
Attention.
The fourth game is about to begin.

01:32.509 --> 01:34.511
Please follow the staff's instructions

01:34.594 --> 01:36.805
and swiftly make your way
towards the game hall.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.058
Let me repeat the instructions.

01:40.558 --> 01:43.103
The fourth game is about to begin.

01:43.186 --> 01:45.355
Please follow the staff's instructions

01:45.438 --> 01:47.982
and swiftly make your way
towards the game hall.

02:12.340 --> 02:14.342
Players,
what you witness before you

02:14.425 --> 02:17.679
is what remains of those who broke
the rules for their own benefit.

02:17.762 --> 02:22.016
They tainted the pure and fair ideology
everything here has been built upon.

02:22.725 --> 02:25.520
Each and every one of you
is considered an equal

02:25.603 --> 02:27.272
within the walls of this facility.

02:27.355 --> 02:29.649
You must be guaranteed
the same opportunities

02:29.732 --> 02:33.236
without being disadvantaged
or facing any kind of discrimination.

02:33.319 --> 02:38.241
We truly apologize for allowing
such an unacceptable incident to occur.

03:07.270 --> 03:10.398
EPISODE 6
GGANBU

03:10.899 --> 03:13.151
ROUND 6
LIST OF WINNERS

03:16.571 --> 03:17.530
NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT

03:56.945 --> 03:58.196
Front Man speaking.

04:00.198 --> 04:02.617
Yes. A minor disturbance took place.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.161
But it's being addressed.

04:05.828 --> 04:07.288
No need to worry.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.582
We'll make sure
there's no trace of the disturbance

04:09.666 --> 04:12.043
by the time the VIPs arrive.

04:13.962 --> 04:17.257
Yes, sir. The game will begin on time,
in line with the schedule.

04:36.651 --> 04:38.152
What's wrong? Are you sad?

04:39.028 --> 04:41.781
Why? Is your connection dead?

04:45.159 --> 04:47.161
I'll kill that little slut.

04:48.121 --> 04:51.749
Players,
welcome to the fourth game.

04:52.458 --> 04:56.045
For this game, you will be playing
in teams of two.

04:56.129 --> 04:59.549
Please look around and find someone
you wish to play with.

04:59.632 --> 05:01.843
When two people agree to play together,

05:01.926 --> 05:04.429
shake hands to show
you have become partners.

05:04.512 --> 05:06.597
Let me repeat the instructions.

05:07.223 --> 05:10.518
For this game, you will be playing
in teams of two.

05:11.102 --> 05:14.439
Please look around and find someone
you wish to play with.

05:14.522 --> 05:16.858
When two people agree to play together,

05:16.941 --> 05:19.402
shake hands to show
you have become partners.

05:19.485 --> 05:21.487
There can only be two players per team.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.698
You will have ten minutes
to find your partner.

06:00.151 --> 06:01.361
Hey, handsome.

06:02.153 --> 06:03.696
Let's do this, huh?

06:04.781 --> 06:05.990
I'm better than you think.

06:06.574 --> 06:08.451
And I'm stronger than most guys too.

06:10.078 --> 06:13.373
Guess what? I know how to con
just about anybody I see.

06:14.040 --> 06:17.126
I'm not a genius,
but I still got it work out. Huh?

06:21.506 --> 06:23.257
Hey, let me play with you.

06:23.341 --> 06:25.551
Then I'll be your dream girl
all night long.

06:27.637 --> 06:30.890
I'll do anything you tell me.
I'm not a regular girl.

06:30.973 --> 06:32.141
Hmm?

06:32.225 --> 06:33.267
Hmm?

06:38.773 --> 06:41.859
You're pretending that you do not want me
on your team. Is that it?

06:42.443 --> 06:43.653
Why? Can't decide?

06:43.736 --> 06:45.530
Want me to choose instead, huh?

06:45.613 --> 06:47.407
Stop embarrassing yourself.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.325
No one will want to play
with you like this.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.703
And you should all be honest.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.666
You don't want a girl to team up with
or an old guy.

06:56.749 --> 06:58.709
Of course we don't. We could die.

06:59.460 --> 07:01.295
We already almost die
in the previous round.

07:01.379 --> 07:02.422
This man is right.

07:03.256 --> 07:06.968
And it was Adam's rib the Lord used
to make Eve after all.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.346
And that's the reason
that we're choosing men.

07:11.764 --> 07:14.767
-They played different roles than women.
-You idiot.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.395
We're not playing in Eden right now.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.648
Uh, hold on a second.

07:25.695 --> 07:28.030
Why? You want a girl?

07:40.585 --> 07:42.628
You're all idiots.

07:43.546 --> 07:48.009
You two, you're making a big mistake,
and you're going to regret it.

07:52.722 --> 07:55.516
-Sang-woo, let's--
-Ali, let's join forces.

07:56.934 --> 08:00.521
Most of these games here,
you need to be strong or smart to win.

08:01.439 --> 08:03.107
And I think if we're a team, we'll…

08:03.900 --> 08:05.860
we'll beat a lot of the others out there.

08:12.700 --> 08:14.911
Uh, uh, no, no, no, no, no.

08:14.994 --> 08:16.496
Uh, it's okay, really, it's…

08:16.579 --> 08:18.915
Uh, you two will make
a great team together.

08:18.998 --> 08:20.541
I'll find someone to play with.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.678
Let's make this work.

08:51.822 --> 08:52.949
Sir…

08:53.908 --> 08:55.159
Sorry, but, um…

08:56.369 --> 08:57.662
You know it's just, um…

08:58.329 --> 09:00.873
-Uh…
-You should go put this on.

09:04.293 --> 09:06.212
Just in case people here…

09:07.421 --> 09:11.425
Well, they might look down on you
for missing it.

09:33.948 --> 09:34.824
You and me…

09:34.907 --> 09:36.117
We'll be the best team.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.332
Hey.

09:46.085 --> 09:47.295
Wanna do this?

09:50.548 --> 09:51.882
Why should I?

09:52.550 --> 09:55.386
I can't picture you going around here
and begging these jerks.

09:55.469 --> 09:56.721
Hmm? Embarrassing.

09:56.804 --> 09:59.557
What matters is winning.
Embarrassing or not.

09:59.640 --> 10:00.933
Then play with me.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.727
I'll make sure that you win.

10:02.810 --> 10:03.853
What will you do?

10:03.936 --> 10:05.187
Whatever it takes.

10:08.024 --> 10:09.525
What do you see in me?

10:09.609 --> 10:11.527
Well, I wanted to ask you that.

10:13.779 --> 10:17.033
You were someone who looked like
they would come with me.

10:18.284 --> 10:19.452
That's how I feel.

10:29.837 --> 10:32.798
I promise, okay?
There's no option left here.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.759
I teach Math at a high school.

10:34.842 --> 10:37.219
And I can run too. Soccer every day.

10:38.971 --> 10:42.183
Everyone was asking,
but I held out so you and I could win.

10:42.266 --> 10:44.185
'Cause you and me would be great together.

10:46.103 --> 10:48.356
The… the thing is…

10:48.439 --> 10:50.816
…we don't know which game
we're playing, so…

10:50.900 --> 10:53.319
Hey, choose me so it can just be done.

10:54.153 --> 10:57.448
At this rate, nobody will be left for you,
and you won't continue.

10:58.407 --> 10:59.283
You know,

10:59.367 --> 11:02.912
since the man who'd been cheating
is gone, there's an uneven number.

11:03.496 --> 11:06.207
Once everyone is in pairs,
there'll be one person.

11:07.541 --> 11:08.959
And what happens to that one?

11:09.043 --> 11:10.169
What do you think?

11:10.252 --> 11:12.171
They'll be out and they'll get killed.

11:13.047 --> 11:14.882
I would guess that old man there.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.267
Stop dragging this out.

11:26.268 --> 11:27.311
Let's play together.

11:43.577 --> 11:44.578
Hey, old man.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.123
Wanna do this together?

11:49.917 --> 11:52.086
The time for finding
a partner is now over.

11:52.169 --> 11:55.089
You guys,
you're all making a big mistake.

11:55.172 --> 11:58.175
Do you really think you can win
without me on your team?

11:59.468 --> 12:01.554
It's me, Han Mi-nyeo!

12:01.637 --> 12:06.559
I've made suckers out of everyone there is
from Dongducheon to Gangnam!

12:06.642 --> 12:07.727
Guys…

12:10.771 --> 12:13.399
What if you have to play Gonggi
or Elastics?

12:13.482 --> 12:14.692
I'm an expert in those.

12:14.775 --> 12:18.112
Babe, please, play with me.
Boys aren't very good at those.

12:18.195 --> 12:19.989
-Hey. Get off.
-Come back!

12:21.532 --> 12:23.993
-Hey, come on, be my partner.
-Oh.

12:24.076 --> 12:25.953
Let's show everyone with a dick
they're wrong!

12:26.036 --> 12:27.705
-Let her go.
-After us, we need to stick together.

12:27.788 --> 12:29.915
-My gosh!
-I work well with women too!

12:29.999 --> 12:32.543
-I'll be really good! I'll be--
-Stop it!

12:35.212 --> 12:37.673
-Hey, don't trust this scumbag.
-Okay, okay.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.676
He's a jerk. He's just gonna throw you
under the bus.

12:40.760 --> 12:41.719
-Okay, sure.
-Look at me.

12:41.802 --> 12:43.971
-That dead doctor and him worked together.
-Okay.

12:44.054 --> 12:45.097
He played you.

12:45.181 --> 12:49.059
He just wanted to save his own ass,
so he kept it secret from you all.

12:49.143 --> 12:50.644
Tell me if I'm wrong, you jerk!

12:50.728 --> 12:52.188
He was with him, guards!

12:52.271 --> 12:53.647
-Hey.
-He deserves to die too!

12:53.731 --> 12:55.399
Let… let go, bitch!

13:18.047 --> 13:19.590
What? Hey, hold on a second.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.218
Why is the room empty?

13:22.968 --> 13:24.512
I still need a partner.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.680
Hold on. Where did they go?

13:26.764 --> 13:28.474
Who… who took my partner?

13:28.557 --> 13:31.352
What's going on here? You can't do this!

13:31.435 --> 13:32.728
Hey, I need a partner!

13:32.812 --> 13:34.939
Let me go! Please!

13:35.022 --> 13:37.483
Bring my partner here, you jerks!

13:37.566 --> 13:39.735
Where's my partner?

13:40.528 --> 13:43.030
I'm so sick of that whore.

13:43.113 --> 13:45.324
It's nice to think
she won't be in my way again.

13:45.407 --> 13:47.326
And, uh…

13:48.452 --> 13:50.204
what she said about you in there,

13:50.913 --> 13:52.373
you working with the doctor…

13:52.873 --> 13:54.250
It's nothing.

13:55.167 --> 13:57.545
That brat was so desperate,
she said whatever she could.

13:58.546 --> 14:02.049
Attention.
All players, please follow the staff

14:02.132 --> 14:04.176
to your designated positions for the game.

14:19.650 --> 14:20.818
Ali.

14:20.901 --> 14:23.988
Look at me. No one can stop us
if we work together.

14:25.114 --> 14:28.659
I think you and I
could really win the money.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.036
All right, let's do this and get out.

14:31.912 --> 14:34.874
That money is ours
to give to both our families.

14:35.499 --> 14:36.333
Let's do it.

14:40.129 --> 14:42.798
You know, when I was a kid,

14:43.591 --> 14:46.552
I live in a neighborhood just like this.

14:46.635 --> 14:47.970
So did I.

14:48.470 --> 14:49.430
And you know something?

14:49.513 --> 14:51.265
-Our alleyway looked very similar.
-Really?

14:56.395 --> 14:58.314
Players,
please take one bag each

14:58.397 --> 15:00.024
from the staff member before you.

15:05.362 --> 15:08.699
There should be a set of ten marbles
in each bag.

15:09.199 --> 15:10.910
Please check to confirm the number.

15:14.204 --> 15:15.664
It's marbles.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.958
Old man, we're gonna be playing with this.

15:18.459 --> 15:20.586
-Hmm.
-Are you familiar with it?

15:21.712 --> 15:23.422
Ah, yes, very familiar.

15:24.131 --> 15:26.592
Used to have a lot as a kid. Ah!

15:26.675 --> 15:29.011
Oh, yes, back in the day.

15:30.179 --> 15:32.890
And you know, I was pretty good.

15:33.557 --> 15:35.476
Not too bad myself.

15:35.559 --> 15:36.769
-Ah, that's good news.
-Yeah.

15:36.852 --> 15:39.146
I'm glad it's not just about our strength.

15:39.688 --> 15:42.524
That means you and I are…

15:43.233 --> 15:45.235
gganbu now, pretty great.

15:45.319 --> 15:46.612
Gganbu, huh?

15:47.196 --> 15:50.950
I thought you said you played this before.
Gganbu, come on, you know.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.159
It's a good friend.

15:52.242 --> 15:54.286
One who you trust a lot.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.080
You share things with them, you see?

15:56.163 --> 15:58.082
-Ah!
-Your marbles, everything.

15:58.165 --> 16:00.501
A gganbu. I remember now.

16:00.584 --> 16:03.295
I had one in my town too.
Used to do everything with him.

16:03.379 --> 16:06.340
Okay, we are gganbu.

16:06.423 --> 16:08.008
Yes.

16:10.302 --> 16:13.430
Should we do this to make it official?

16:14.640 --> 16:16.308
Yeah, buddy. Like this.

16:18.268 --> 16:20.854
-You and me, sir… Oh, no, gganbu, man.
-Yeah? Mm.

16:20.938 --> 16:23.232
We'll go around this whole town,
and take all the marbles.

16:27.987 --> 16:31.865
In this game,
using your set of ten marbles,

16:31.949 --> 16:35.285
you will play the game of your choice
with your partner.

16:35.369 --> 16:39.415
The player who manages to take
all ten marbles from their partner wins.

16:40.749 --> 16:42.543
Let me repeat the instructions.

16:43.419 --> 16:45.629
Using your set of ten marbles,

16:45.713 --> 16:48.257
play the game of your choice
with your partner.

16:48.340 --> 16:52.636
The player who manages to take
all ten marbles from their partner wins.

16:52.720 --> 16:54.638
Oh, boy.

16:55.264 --> 16:57.474
Shit, man.

17:05.566 --> 17:06.483
Sang-woo.

17:11.780 --> 17:12.948
How pretty.

17:14.491 --> 17:16.952
Sir, excuse me.

17:18.579 --> 17:21.331
You will have 30 minutes for this game.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.250
Let the game begins.

17:23.917 --> 17:25.669
Uh, sir, come back.

17:50.402 --> 17:51.278
Let's start.

17:52.362 --> 17:55.115
That means one of us ends up dead,
doesn't it?

17:55.199 --> 17:58.535
So both of us should do nothing then?
So we should just die?

18:00.662 --> 18:02.831
Or one of us dies so the other can go on.

18:06.418 --> 18:08.087
You haven't played before, right?

18:13.550 --> 18:16.637
Since the Korean War,
nothing has been this sad.

18:17.721 --> 18:18.639
Tragic.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.517
What should we play then?

18:22.017 --> 18:23.560
Wow. You're so cold.

18:24.561 --> 18:25.771
As cold as ice.

18:27.856 --> 18:30.734
So you a spy from the North or what?

18:30.818 --> 18:32.528
Hey, stop the dumbshit, girl.

18:34.196 --> 18:35.781
What game are we gonna play?

18:39.451 --> 18:40.786
You tell me.

18:42.412 --> 18:44.665
These boomers know all these games.

18:46.917 --> 18:49.044
Ten marbles,
then we can create our own game.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.214
Hmm. I'll try to come up with one.

18:55.342 --> 18:57.136
We must be close.

18:57.761 --> 19:00.639
Yes, it was somewhere around here, huh.

19:02.432 --> 19:06.103
Come on, let's play. Sir, we need to, huh?
Come, let's play this right now.

19:06.186 --> 19:08.105
This is so strange.

19:08.814 --> 19:12.401
It should be here. This is the alley.

19:12.901 --> 19:16.071
Where… My house, where did it go?

19:16.155 --> 19:17.364
Sir, come back.

19:21.702 --> 19:26.498
So you guess if I'm holding even or odd.
Which one you think is in here.

19:26.582 --> 19:27.916
That all makes sense to you?

19:28.500 --> 19:29.751
Even or odd?

19:31.170 --> 19:32.254
What's that?

19:34.840 --> 19:37.634
Odd is like one, three, five.

19:39.386 --> 19:42.181
And even is two, four, six.

19:43.390 --> 19:44.349
Understand?

19:47.102 --> 19:51.523
Just think it through.
Then you wager a few of your own.

19:53.859 --> 19:54.860
Odd.

20:04.786 --> 20:05.829
Open your hand.

20:13.503 --> 20:14.755
Ah, shit.

20:15.339 --> 20:18.091
I should have added another one.

20:21.136 --> 20:22.930
Stop giggling, asshole.

20:23.889 --> 20:27.142
Hey, old man,
who are you calling asshole, huh?

20:27.726 --> 20:31.104
You really think I'm your minion
just 'cause I call you "boss" a few times?

20:31.188 --> 20:33.273
-You wanna die, you bastard?
-You wanna show me?

20:33.357 --> 20:35.651
Ooh! So, how are you gonna do it?

20:35.734 --> 20:40.113
Hmm? You can't resort to violence,
you puny little idiot dog.

20:45.786 --> 20:48.789
Sir, we have to play now.
We gotta start right now.

20:49.623 --> 20:50.666
Play what?

20:51.708 --> 20:53.669
With our marbles. Let's go.

20:54.711 --> 20:55.712
Why should I?

20:56.505 --> 20:58.799
Look around you. Everybody else is too.

21:01.593 --> 21:03.178
We gotta do this.

21:03.929 --> 21:04.972
No.

21:06.056 --> 21:08.892
That game is for little children.

21:10.102 --> 21:12.562
No. Sir, come back here.

21:15.899 --> 21:17.109
So let's…

21:18.151 --> 21:19.945
end the game in one round.

21:23.532 --> 21:26.201
All or nothing. A simple bet.

21:29.663 --> 21:32.749
Don't tell me that you would
rather do what they are?

21:33.709 --> 21:35.502
Watch.

21:36.461 --> 21:38.922
-Bullseye! Yes.
-Ah, damn it.

21:41.425 --> 21:43.135
-My turn.
-Okay.

21:43.844 --> 21:45.137
Playing what then?

21:45.220 --> 21:47.014
Why are you in such a hurry?

21:48.015 --> 21:49.641
You're just dying to kill me, huh?

21:54.563 --> 21:56.356
We're just playing one round here.

21:57.816 --> 21:59.192
And we got time left too.

22:00.485 --> 22:01.903
Let's wait till the end.

22:02.529 --> 22:04.406
What are we gonna do before then?

22:05.532 --> 22:06.450
Talk.

22:06.950 --> 22:08.493
About what, though?

22:10.037 --> 22:12.456
Things we never told anybody about
I guess.

22:15.292 --> 22:17.377
One of us is gonna die here, so…

22:19.171 --> 22:20.964
doesn't matter what we tell each other.

22:21.631 --> 22:23.842
No one can really embarrass
themselves anymore.

22:24.718 --> 22:25.594
Okay?

22:27.637 --> 22:29.097
Even.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.485
What's your wager?

22:44.654 --> 22:45.697
Two.

23:04.091 --> 23:05.133
You're up now.

23:07.803 --> 23:09.304
I don't want to do this with you, sir.

23:09.971 --> 23:10.806
Can I stop?

23:11.973 --> 23:13.600
I would like to play with someone else--

23:13.683 --> 23:15.477
Shut up and keep playing with me. Come on.

23:16.103 --> 23:18.188
Sir, he's not in his right mind, sir.

23:18.271 --> 23:19.648
I think he's got dementia.

23:20.273 --> 23:21.733
That does mean that he's out or…

23:21.817 --> 23:24.194
He's not gonna play.
So that means he forfeited, right? Huh?

23:25.695 --> 23:26.947
Ah, shit.

23:30.450 --> 23:32.911
Just one little game, okay?
Here, it'll be…

23:32.994 --> 23:34.830
It'll be so much fun, sir.

23:34.913 --> 23:37.416
No. I'd better go home now.

23:38.667 --> 23:43.713
I know my house is nearby.
It's somewhere down this alley.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.800
Shit! Goddamn it!

23:46.883 --> 23:49.594
Will you please just pull yourself
together, old man?

23:50.095 --> 23:52.931
They'll kill us both
if we don't get started soon!

23:53.932 --> 23:56.810
You got that thing in your head,
so I bet you don't care what happens here,

23:56.893 --> 23:59.229
but I won't just sit here and die, okay?

23:59.312 --> 24:00.730
Listen, I can't die!

24:00.814 --> 24:02.941
I need to get out of here.

24:03.024 --> 24:04.693
Don't yell at me.

24:06.153 --> 24:08.780
All right, I will, but don't yell.

24:14.661 --> 24:19.374
…12, 13, 14, 15. Bam, okay.

24:22.043 --> 24:23.545
We're playing something else.

24:24.087 --> 24:26.339
No way. I'm not gonna stop now.

24:27.799 --> 24:30.135
We already did things how you suggested.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.180
I should get a chance to choose.

24:34.681 --> 24:36.308
No.

24:39.144 --> 24:40.270
Goddamn it.

24:42.022 --> 24:44.357
You people said we're equals.
What is this?

24:44.441 --> 24:47.110
I think we should play
a new game here, huh?

24:48.904 --> 24:50.155
Request accepted.

24:57.621 --> 24:59.247
What do you wanna play then, huh?

25:01.625 --> 25:02.459
Even.

25:08.757 --> 25:10.550
Do it. Show me.

25:40.872 --> 25:42.207
You asshole.

25:45.335 --> 25:46.836
You gotta be cheating.

25:47.420 --> 25:49.756
Uh, Sang-woo, why would I do that to you?

25:49.839 --> 25:51.716
How are you winning like this every round?

25:51.800 --> 25:53.426
You keep beating me. How's that?

25:54.803 --> 25:56.721
The odds should be 50-50.
That means you're cheating!

25:57.305 --> 25:59.808
I didn't. No!
Sir, I wouldn't do that to you.

26:00.559 --> 26:03.436
You jerk! You pretended not to know
how this works!

26:03.520 --> 26:05.313
You said you haven't done this before!

26:05.397 --> 26:08.316
How did you do it, huh? Spill it!

26:15.991 --> 26:17.993
Why did you come here from the North?

26:18.702 --> 26:20.370
I thought things were good over here.

26:24.708 --> 26:25.667
And so?

26:26.835 --> 26:27.836
Were you right?

26:34.259 --> 26:36.636
Your family, are they here with you?

26:40.390 --> 26:41.725
Just my brother.

26:42.517 --> 26:43.852
Your parents?

26:48.773 --> 26:52.027
My father got shot trying to swim
across the border and drowned.

26:52.110 --> 26:53.278
Our mother…

26:55.280 --> 26:58.992
she was hiding in China and got sent back
once the immigration agents found her.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.122
Where is your brother now then?

27:08.293 --> 27:09.586
In a shelter.

27:13.923 --> 27:15.050
Even.

27:24.517 --> 27:27.937
Odd. Even. Odd. Even.

27:28.730 --> 27:30.065
So did I win?

27:32.108 --> 27:33.318
What's your wager?

27:39.532 --> 27:40.867
Oh…

27:49.959 --> 27:51.878
We take turns throwing marbles

27:51.961 --> 27:55.256
till you make a shot that lands
in the hole I dug over there.

27:55.924 --> 27:56.758
Then what happens?

27:56.841 --> 28:00.428
What happens is that person
gets to take everything on the ground.

28:01.137 --> 28:02.847
Ah…

28:02.931 --> 28:05.809
You mean, you want a way
to turn this around, huh.

28:05.892 --> 28:08.561
-What? You scared?
-Not a chance.

28:09.145 --> 28:10.647
I'm not worried at all.

28:12.440 --> 28:15.819
I'm pretty good
at getting things in the holes, huh.

28:16.403 --> 28:18.279
You sure about this, hmm?

28:23.243 --> 28:27.038
If you win the money and get out of here,
what's your plan then?

28:28.123 --> 28:30.625
I did this to get a house
where I could be with my brother first.

28:30.709 --> 28:32.168
Then I'll get our mother out of the North.

28:33.670 --> 28:37.382
Hey, with a price that big,
you can do a whole lot more than that.

28:38.133 --> 28:39.509
You gotta want something else too.

28:40.260 --> 28:41.678
Is there anywhere you wanna go?

28:44.264 --> 28:45.515
Jeju Island.

28:45.598 --> 28:46.850
Jeju Island?

28:49.394 --> 28:50.812
There was a thing about it on TV.

28:51.396 --> 28:53.940
It looked exotic.
It didn't look like Korea at all.

28:54.023 --> 28:55.316
Hey.

28:56.025 --> 28:57.986
Don't you think
you should dream bigger, huh?

28:58.528 --> 29:02.282
Do Hawaii. Hold on, go to the Maldives
for a while instead.

29:02.365 --> 29:03.950
And have a mojito too.

29:05.952 --> 29:07.162
Mojito?

29:07.245 --> 29:08.830
Like the movie.

29:08.913 --> 29:10.498
Lee Byung-hun's in it.

29:11.499 --> 29:13.626
"Go to mojito
and have a glass of Maldives."

29:14.461 --> 29:15.545
Really?

29:17.380 --> 29:19.507
Oh, no, we gotta fix that then.

29:19.591 --> 29:20.759
Well, once we're out of here,

29:20.842 --> 29:24.012
we'll have a girls' night out
and make mojitos and everything, okay?

29:30.143 --> 29:31.352
Oh.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.565
We can't both get out of here.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.205
God, I'm so sorry, Ali.

29:51.831 --> 29:53.208
I know you won't cheat.

29:54.167 --> 29:56.294
But I can't die this way, I beg you.

29:57.378 --> 29:59.047
They'll kill my family

30:00.799 --> 30:02.675
if I don't get out of here.

30:02.759 --> 30:05.678
Sorry, Sang-woo. No.

30:07.055 --> 30:08.306
I'm so sorry.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.975
I have to think of my family.

30:11.559 --> 30:12.894
Hey, Ali. Hey.

30:13.478 --> 30:14.938
Hey, come on, if you help me,

30:15.021 --> 30:16.940
then there's a way
that both of us could live.

30:18.066 --> 30:20.068
You only got this far 'cause I was there.

30:21.528 --> 30:23.696
Like when I gave the bus fare to you and…

30:23.780 --> 30:25.949
I'm the one who got the team
through Tug-of-War,

30:26.032 --> 30:28.159
we kept watch at night together.

30:28.243 --> 30:29.536
And just before this begin,

30:29.619 --> 30:31.746
you and I swore
that we leave here together, right, Ali?

30:33.414 --> 30:35.333
Listen, Ali, please.

30:35.416 --> 30:38.211
Trust me, help me
and I'll make sure we get out of here.

30:39.212 --> 30:40.088
Huh?

30:42.799 --> 30:44.342
Okay. What do we do?

30:45.176 --> 30:47.929
What is it? It might be odd.

30:50.223 --> 30:52.851
On the other hand, it could be even.

30:55.395 --> 30:57.689
-That must be it.
-Come on, hurry up and go.

30:58.815 --> 30:59.941
Odd.

31:12.287 --> 31:15.456
Look at that. I won again.

31:16.124 --> 31:17.500
How many are in yours?

31:17.584 --> 31:19.377
Uh…

31:21.713 --> 31:23.673
Oh, shit.

31:25.008 --> 31:26.092
Oh, shit.

31:40.648 --> 31:42.692
I, uh…

31:43.276 --> 31:44.611
I still have one.

31:44.694 --> 31:46.279
I still have one more.

32:16.935 --> 32:18.061
Yeah!

32:20.730 --> 32:22.106
Goddamn it.

32:22.857 --> 32:24.233
Okay, here's what I think.

32:24.317 --> 32:27.403
I think there are gonna be teams out there
who can't decide the winner either.

32:27.987 --> 32:29.364
Mm. Why not?

32:30.073 --> 32:31.491
Think about how you win.

32:31.574 --> 32:35.203
Remember the rules. Thirty minutes
to determine who will win or lose.

32:37.038 --> 32:38.122
So think about it.

32:38.206 --> 32:40.875
Some teams aren't gonna have a winner
when time is finally up, right?

32:40.959 --> 32:43.753
You win and you lose,
and things just keep going on like that.

32:43.836 --> 32:45.880
That means not every team
will have a winner.

32:45.964 --> 32:47.840
What will they do?
Eliminate all those teams?

32:48.341 --> 32:50.718
Makes no sense.
They have to decide who won. Don't they?

32:52.011 --> 32:52.845
Yeah.

32:53.680 --> 32:57.100
We'll play again.
We'll be working together.

32:58.226 --> 33:00.436
We're teammates.
So we'll just add up everything.

33:00.520 --> 33:03.106
Our team will go play other teams
with all 20.

33:05.066 --> 33:06.609
You and I can play as a team

33:07.652 --> 33:09.737
just like we planned to from the start.

33:11.781 --> 33:13.408
You and I will get out of here.

33:20.373 --> 33:22.750
Player 414, eliminated.

33:24.752 --> 33:26.045
Is that what you want?

33:27.213 --> 33:28.715
You want them to do that to me?

33:32.385 --> 33:34.012
Player 2, eliminated.

33:34.095 --> 33:36.806
You ever have to see anyone die
before those?

33:38.683 --> 33:41.644
Once, we have this plague
go through my town when I was a kid.

33:44.188 --> 33:47.316
As time went on, more and more towns
got sick and died.

33:49.110 --> 33:52.321
Soldiers started carrying the dead
into piles and lit them on fire.

33:53.322 --> 33:56.576
That's how my grandpa, grandma
and older brother all died.

33:57.785 --> 33:59.037
They burned together.

34:00.079 --> 34:03.332
Damn. Your stories are
a bit too dark even for me.

34:05.585 --> 34:06.502
And you?

34:07.420 --> 34:08.504
What have you seen?

34:13.634 --> 34:15.845
Player 130, eliminated.

34:16.345 --> 34:17.722
First body I saw…

34:18.639 --> 34:19.599
my mother's.

34:21.017 --> 34:23.102
One day, I came back from school,

34:24.228 --> 34:26.522
and my mom was lying there,
dead on the floor.

34:28.649 --> 34:29.859
And next to her…

34:31.402 --> 34:33.654
was my so-called dad with a knife.

34:35.865 --> 34:37.617
The next body that I saw…

34:40.453 --> 34:41.746
that was my dad's.

34:44.082 --> 34:46.501
And the person standing there
holding the knife…

34:47.085 --> 34:48.211
that was me.

34:50.671 --> 34:52.757
He was a goddamn pastor too.

34:56.302 --> 34:58.096
And when he hit her and…

34:59.806 --> 35:03.017
did the things he did to me,
he would talk to God.

35:04.769 --> 35:07.063
He'd always ask for forgiveness.

35:07.814 --> 35:10.525
He didn't pray on that day
after he killed her.

35:13.736 --> 35:15.822
I was too mad he even forgot, I guess.

35:28.167 --> 35:30.253
Player 40, eliminated.

35:38.427 --> 35:39.470
Even.

35:41.639 --> 35:44.058
No, hold on. That's not what…
Wait a minute.

35:44.142 --> 35:46.394
Just give me a second.

35:48.437 --> 35:49.480
Odd.

35:50.773 --> 35:51.899
Odd.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.332
Which one did you just say?

36:14.297 --> 36:15.173
What?

36:17.675 --> 36:19.051
Can you repeat…

36:20.052 --> 36:22.346
what you said just now?

36:26.767 --> 36:27.894
Even.

36:29.395 --> 36:30.688
I said…

36:31.355 --> 36:32.398
even.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.321
Oh.

36:39.572 --> 36:41.324
I lost this one.

36:52.418 --> 36:53.377
Oh.

37:04.972 --> 37:08.142
We both can win this round? Are you sure?

37:08.226 --> 37:09.518
Hmm.

37:10.478 --> 37:11.479
You're positive?

37:11.562 --> 37:14.565
Just hear me out first
and then turn me down if you like.

37:15.650 --> 37:17.276
I mean it. Here.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.404
Let me just give you this
to hold on to, okay?

37:22.240 --> 37:24.659
So you won't have any guilt
around my death.

37:25.868 --> 37:26.994
Your plan…

37:28.120 --> 37:29.330
what is it?

37:30.414 --> 37:32.416
Player 68, eliminated.

37:32.500 --> 37:34.502
Well, it will depend
on who we're going against.

37:34.585 --> 37:36.963
We need to know which teams will be here
after the round ends.

37:37.964 --> 37:39.507
We better split up to get an idea

37:39.590 --> 37:41.509
how all the other teams are doing
to be prepared.

37:42.218 --> 37:44.470
Let's look for one
that seem too young or old,

37:44.553 --> 37:47.223
and check only teams that are still
playing games at this point.

37:48.224 --> 37:50.017
-Young or old?
-Yeah.

37:50.101 --> 37:51.435
That's what we need.

37:52.687 --> 37:54.105
Like someone who looks your same age

37:54.188 --> 37:56.983
or someone who seems like
they're older than 50.

37:59.318 --> 38:02.154
You go up a few blocks from here,
then meet up back up with me later, okay?

38:02.238 --> 38:03.322
Okay, Sang-woo.

38:09.662 --> 38:11.539
-Ali.
-Huh?

38:12.790 --> 38:13.833
Your pouch there.

38:15.710 --> 38:17.336
It's too dangerous to keep it out.

38:18.212 --> 38:20.131
These people are bound to go crazy
before the end.

38:20.214 --> 38:21.590
Who knows what'll happen then?

38:22.717 --> 38:25.094
Lose it and we'll both die. You got that?

38:27.013 --> 38:29.181
Here. I'll make sure that it's safe, okay?

38:49.285 --> 38:51.787
What are you gonna do
if you win all that money and get out?

38:52.747 --> 38:54.206
I don't know what I would do.

38:56.876 --> 38:58.377
Someone was waiting

38:59.211 --> 39:00.963
at the prison the day I got out.

39:01.922 --> 39:04.759
I thought he was a creditor
who came to collect my dad's debt.

39:04.842 --> 39:06.594
But he pulled out a card.

39:07.219 --> 39:08.763
That weird card.

39:10.514 --> 39:13.309
I had nowhere else to go, so I…

39:15.311 --> 39:19.065
never thought about what I'd do
if I got the money.

39:22.526 --> 39:23.944
Go with you to Jeju Island?

39:30.076 --> 39:31.118
Sorry.

39:31.702 --> 39:33.329
I forgot again.

39:33.412 --> 39:36.374
Player 229, eliminated.

39:40.294 --> 39:42.129
Oh, damn it.

39:43.381 --> 39:44.632
Fuck.

39:45.633 --> 39:48.344
Goddamn it.

40:18.833 --> 40:20.751
I thought that was in. Damn it.

40:23.170 --> 40:24.380
So you're all out?

40:27.675 --> 40:28.801
Look at that.

40:30.594 --> 40:31.720
One more right here.

40:36.725 --> 40:39.145
Deok-su.

40:41.147 --> 40:42.565
Nice knowing you.

41:13.512 --> 41:15.973
That blue that went in,
that's mine, asshole!

41:16.056 --> 41:17.433
Shit.

41:17.516 --> 41:19.518
It was nice knowing you, you shithead.

41:27.735 --> 41:29.069
Damn it!

41:32.865 --> 41:34.450
Okay.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.369
Oh. Oh.

41:39.788 --> 41:40.789
You are all assholes!

41:45.211 --> 41:48.380
Player 278, eliminated.

41:51.425 --> 41:53.552
Done.

41:55.554 --> 41:56.514
Here.

41:57.515 --> 41:58.349
How's that?

41:58.432 --> 41:59.934
It feels safer like that, doesn't it?

42:02.978 --> 42:03.979
Yeah.

42:04.063 --> 42:07.107
When the timer says three minutes,
come and meet up with me here.

42:07.191 --> 42:08.567
Then I'll tell you what we do next.

42:13.113 --> 42:14.114
Odd.

42:20.162 --> 42:22.581
One, two, three.

42:23.832 --> 42:26.001
One, two, three.

42:27.586 --> 42:30.422
We've got three each.

42:32.091 --> 42:35.636
Yeah, but, um, what was your guess?

42:37.304 --> 42:38.222
Huh?

42:40.182 --> 42:44.311
Oh, yeah. But which one did I guess?

42:46.230 --> 42:47.982
You said even was your guess.

42:48.816 --> 42:49.817
Did I…

42:50.818 --> 42:52.152
Did I say that?

42:55.656 --> 42:56.574
Yeah.

43:01.370 --> 43:02.496
That means…

43:03.664 --> 43:05.499
that I lost again.

43:13.841 --> 43:16.594
Player 43, eliminated.

43:19.680 --> 43:21.599
-A team of older people.
-No, wait.

43:22.891 --> 43:24.977
Player 85, eliminated.

43:25.060 --> 43:27.438
No, no, no, no, no.

43:27.521 --> 43:29.356
Three youngsters.

43:29.440 --> 43:31.066
Oh, get out of the way.

43:31.150 --> 43:33.193
Two old people.

43:42.536 --> 43:45.122
Player 276, eliminated.

44:06.810 --> 44:08.145
Come on. It's your turn.

44:08.228 --> 44:09.188
Huh?

44:10.356 --> 44:12.191
Oh. Right.

44:13.484 --> 44:14.360
Here.

44:26.830 --> 44:27.748
Odd.

44:29.917 --> 44:30.918
Oh.

44:31.585 --> 44:34.171
Hold on. What's today's date?

44:35.839 --> 44:37.966
My son has his birthday soon.

44:38.676 --> 44:41.470
What day is it? The 24th?

44:43.138 --> 44:46.350
I was going to buy him a toy robot
for his birthday.

44:46.934 --> 44:51.063
This year, I need to get him a gift.
I completely forgot last year.

44:51.772 --> 44:55.567
I better do that soon.
I can't forget again.

45:00.989 --> 45:02.199
Oh.

45:03.325 --> 45:04.576
My hand.

45:05.911 --> 45:09.248
What was your guess? A-Again?

45:12.292 --> 45:13.460
Odd.

45:13.544 --> 45:14.962
Oh.

45:15.713 --> 45:16.797
Oh.

45:36.108 --> 45:37.276
I have 20 marbles.

45:38.152 --> 45:39.528
The rule said we could play

45:40.237 --> 45:42.906
whatever game to get our opponent
to give us theirs,

45:42.990 --> 45:45.451
and the players cannot acquire them
using violence.

45:47.327 --> 45:49.621
Well, I made absolutely sure
no harm was done.

45:56.462 --> 45:59.173
You have three minutes
until the game is over.

45:59.256 --> 46:01.300
Three minutes remaining.

46:17.107 --> 46:19.902
Player 158, eliminated.

46:22.780 --> 46:23.822
Let's do this.

46:36.293 --> 46:38.212
Whoever throws one over there

46:38.295 --> 46:41.048
and makes the shot that comes closest
to the wall, wins.

46:41.882 --> 46:43.008
How's that?

46:49.431 --> 46:50.724
It's Sae-byeok.

46:51.600 --> 46:52.434
What is?

46:53.018 --> 46:53.977
My name.

46:55.562 --> 46:56.438
Kang Sae-byeok.

46:58.398 --> 46:59.525
Sae-byeok.

47:00.818 --> 47:01.693
Pretty.

47:03.695 --> 47:04.571
And you?

47:04.655 --> 47:05.739
Ji-yeong.

47:06.740 --> 47:08.075
Your family name?

47:10.911 --> 47:12.704
Don't have one. That's it.

47:17.751 --> 47:19.336
Who should go first then?

47:19.419 --> 47:20.504
It should be your turn.

47:21.672 --> 47:23.298
Since your number is lower.

47:29.388 --> 47:33.392
Let me see. Darn it.
I'm out of marbles.

47:34.977 --> 47:36.061
Mm.

47:38.939 --> 47:40.357
What should I do, huh?

47:41.859 --> 47:43.652
I'd love to keep playing.

47:46.154 --> 47:49.157
Hey. Would you let me

47:49.867 --> 47:52.661
borrow one from you? Just for a while.

47:56.915 --> 47:58.208
Sir, I'm sorry.

48:00.961 --> 48:03.881
-Player 70, eliminated.
-Oh.

48:04.840 --> 48:06.008
Look at that.

48:07.009 --> 48:09.303
Forgot I had another one here.

48:12.681 --> 48:14.725
Not out yet.

48:14.808 --> 48:16.143
One more to go.

48:23.191 --> 48:25.193
Two, four, six, eight.

48:25.277 --> 48:28.071
Two, four, six, eight. Nineteen.

48:28.155 --> 48:29.531
Nineteen.

48:30.866 --> 48:33.660
Uh… Sir, wait. Hold on a second.

48:34.244 --> 48:35.203
Sir, come back!

49:15.452 --> 49:16.703
Hey, what are you doing?

49:20.165 --> 49:21.500
I lost. You won.

49:21.583 --> 49:23.877
Stop. Why the hell
would you try to do that?

49:24.711 --> 49:27.089
Hey, butter fingers, what else can I say?

49:28.799 --> 49:29.925
What you said

49:31.176 --> 49:33.053
making sure that I won.
Is that what this is?

49:35.806 --> 49:37.808
You think I'll be thankful
that you did this, huh?

49:38.517 --> 49:39.643
Take another throw.

49:39.726 --> 49:41.812
And I still wouldn't be able to win.

49:42.688 --> 49:45.023
Ugh. Just let me lose
this thing in style, okay?

49:45.107 --> 49:48.151
Ji-yeong, that's bullshit!
Stop acting cool and just do a real throw!

49:51.321 --> 49:52.531
I have nothing.

49:53.198 --> 49:54.241
What?

49:55.617 --> 49:57.703
You got a reason to get out of this place,

50:00.163 --> 50:01.164
but I don't.

50:05.711 --> 50:07.212
I thought hard about what I'd do.

50:09.297 --> 50:12.175
If I were the one who got out
since you asked me earlier.

50:14.261 --> 50:17.180
No matter how hard I thought, though,
I got nothing.

50:21.309 --> 50:23.645
The one who should have a reason
to get back out there…

50:24.813 --> 50:25.897
that's what's right.

50:31.653 --> 50:34.364
You can do it. Don't die in here, okay?

50:35.073 --> 50:36.283
And go…

50:38.243 --> 50:39.745
And go meet your mother.

50:41.371 --> 50:42.873
Go get your brother too.

50:43.790 --> 50:46.877
And go to Jeju Island.

50:51.548 --> 50:52.632
Sang-woo.

50:53.675 --> 50:56.386
Sang-woo, where are you?

50:56.470 --> 50:59.306
Sang-woo? Sang-woo, hello?

51:00.182 --> 51:01.808
I'm done with this side.

51:03.060 --> 51:04.227
Sang-woo!

51:06.563 --> 51:07.689
Sang-woo!

51:49.189 --> 51:51.691
Player 199, eliminated.

52:00.867 --> 52:02.119
Kang Sae-byeok!

52:09.960 --> 52:11.169
I'm honored…

52:13.463 --> 52:15.006
that we were partners.

52:19.469 --> 52:21.888
Player 240, eliminated.

52:34.860 --> 52:38.655
Sir, please. Let's just…
let's just play one more time, huh?

52:38.738 --> 52:40.407
Come on, one more round.

52:41.575 --> 52:42.576
Oh.

52:42.659 --> 52:43.952
Oh, shit.

52:44.035 --> 52:45.245
It's this one.

52:48.290 --> 52:49.666
Yes, this is it.

52:50.417 --> 52:52.544
My wife and I had this one here.

52:53.420 --> 52:56.256
I raised my son right in here.

52:57.674 --> 53:03.263
Yes. I even had a nice little pond
right here in the front yard.

53:03.346 --> 53:05.765
Sir, please,
you have one marble left.

53:05.849 --> 53:07.851
We're running out of time, sir.

53:08.935 --> 53:12.355
And I, I would come home from work,

53:13.315 --> 53:17.861
and see my son, his friends
were always here and they would all play,

53:17.944 --> 53:19.905
and they wouldn't even know I was here.

53:19.988 --> 53:21.448
You need to get it together!

53:21.531 --> 53:24.034
Get it together and play with me again
right now, understood?

53:24.117 --> 53:27.913
I would hide and I'd go
just behind the utility pole there

53:27.996 --> 53:31.166
and take a peek at all of them playing
and just watching.

53:31.750 --> 53:34.419
They would always have so much fun.

53:34.502 --> 53:35.879
Sir, please.

53:37.339 --> 53:39.216
Try to snap out of it, sir.

53:42.344 --> 53:44.971
Oh, God. Sir, I'm begging you.

53:49.768 --> 53:54.981
Why don't we do one more and bet it all?

53:58.777 --> 53:59.653
What?

54:00.237 --> 54:02.530
Everything that I still got,

54:03.448 --> 54:05.742
and everything that you'd…

54:08.286 --> 54:09.913
You can't possibly mean that.

54:10.705 --> 54:13.250
You're gonna take yours and bet it all,

54:13.333 --> 54:17.337
and I'll do the same
with everything that I still got here.

54:17.963 --> 54:20.966
Okay? Keeps everything fair.

54:21.549 --> 54:24.678
I'll wager all I got just to get your one?

54:26.930 --> 54:28.515
What kind of nonsense is this?

54:29.808 --> 54:31.351
There's no sense at all!

54:33.144 --> 54:34.145
So then…

54:35.563 --> 54:38.066
that's what you did this whole time.

54:39.359 --> 54:43.571
Does tricking your friend like that
make sense to you?

55:15.186 --> 55:16.396
Take it.

55:19.274 --> 55:20.650
It's yours anyway.

55:24.154 --> 55:25.322
We are…

55:26.323 --> 55:27.782
gganbu, aren't we?
