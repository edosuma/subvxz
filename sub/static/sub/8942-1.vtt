02:39.826 --> 02:42.828
Alan, every ten-year-old
is afraid of something.

02:42.829 --> 02:45.498
The kid's afraid of
tuna-fish sandwiches.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.375
Mercury levels in the tuna.

02:47.376 --> 02:49.418
Whatever.

02:49.419 --> 02:52.755
Alan, the world is a frightening
place to him right now.

02:52.756 --> 02:55.129
I think we could be a
little more supportive.

02:55.258 --> 02:57.927
Supportive? I'm the most
supportive father on earth,

02:57.928 --> 03:00.179
but I'm running out of
supportive things to do.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.640
I signed him up for Little
League, he drove everybody crazy

03:02.641 --> 03:04.975
with statistics about how
you can develop tumors

03:04.976 --> 03:07.144
from being hit in the
head with a ball.

03:07.270 --> 03:11.691
Did you know that shin splints can
lead to blood clots in the legs?

03:11.692 --> 03:15.945
Claire, he brought in a medical journal.
Nobody wanted to play after that.

03:15.946 --> 03:20.447
And now I'm building him a tree
house, in a tree he refuses to climb.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.994
You know he hates heights.

03:23.745 --> 03:27.995
I don't know. I just want
to be a good father.

03:28.417 --> 03:31.166
But you are a good father.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.636
I'm OK! I'm OK!

03:43.473 --> 03:45.266
Aah! No, I'm not!

03:54.943 --> 03:56.152
Hey. Rich!

03:57.487 --> 03:58.571
Well?

03:58.572 --> 03:59.947
You like it?

03:59.948 --> 04:01.445
Uh, yeah, it's great, Dad.

04:01.616 --> 04:04.990
Hey, how about bringing
me up that bag of nails?

04:06.997 --> 04:08.574
No, come on up!

04:08.665 --> 04:11.000
Look. Solid as a rock.

04:11.001 --> 04:15.172
Dad, eight percent of all household
accidents involve ladders.

04:15.173 --> 04:17.757
Another three percent
involve trees.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.586
We're looking at 11
percent probability here.

04:20.719 --> 04:24.719
Fine. Just put the bag
in the bucket, OK?

04:36.902 --> 04:38.194
- Rich.
- Huh?

04:38.612 --> 04:40.814
Ow!

04:41.948 --> 04:43.449
Oh! Oh!

04:43.450 --> 04:46.035
Dad! Do you have
feeling in your toes?

04:46.036 --> 04:48.204
Yes, I have feeling in my toes.

04:48.205 --> 04:49.955
Oh, Alan, honey, are you OK?

04:49.956 --> 04:51.081
Yeah, I'm fine.

04:51.082 --> 04:53.501
Fine. Oh!

04:54.002 --> 04:55.749
Can't argue with statistics, Dad.

04:56.213 --> 04:59.215
Statistics. Here's
something you can do,

04:59.216 --> 05:02.593
go down to Gutman's Hardware
Store, buy a pound of these.

05:02.594 --> 05:03.719
But, Dad...

05:03.720 --> 05:06.680
Son, you can't live your
life based on statistics.

05:06.681 --> 05:08.679
You've gotta take some chances.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.226
Now come on, buddy.

05:10.227 --> 05:12.225
You can do this.

05:17.818 --> 05:22.524
This is not good.
Definitely not good.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.601
- All right!
- Whoa! Good one!

05:52.602 --> 05:55.354
You went further that time.

05:55.355 --> 05:58.650
- All right! Way to go, dude!
- All right, line it up.

06:03.613 --> 06:06.448
Hey, guys, look, it's Richie Tyler.

06:06.449 --> 06:11.287
Hey, check out his clothes. Hey,
Tyler, where you going, the moon?

06:11.288 --> 06:12.955
Get cable in that thing, Tyler?

06:12.956 --> 06:16.667
Hey, what's the
matter, you chicken?

06:16.668 --> 06:19.542
What's the matter, wuss,
forgot your training wheels?

06:46.823 --> 06:48.240
Uhh!

06:53.496 --> 06:54.913
Uhh!

07:28.406 --> 07:30.449
No cranial damage.

07:47.008 --> 07:49.461
Oh!

08:10.240 --> 08:12.491
Hello?

08:56.286 --> 08:59.246
Welcome to the library, young man.

08:59.247 --> 09:03.459
Don't tell me. You're
here for a special book.

09:03.460 --> 09:06.795
- Mister...
- Stop, stop, stop. Allow me to guess.

09:06.796 --> 09:09.965
I have a talent for
guessing what people need.

09:09.966 --> 09:13.427
You're in need of...

09:13.428 --> 09:15.304
a fantasy.

09:15.305 --> 09:17.598
Brave knights,

09:17.599 --> 09:21.935
mythical fairies,
ferocious dragons.

09:21.936 --> 09:23.312
Look, all I want is...

09:23.313 --> 09:24.605
Adventure!

09:24.606 --> 09:29.068
Of course. You're a boy
who loves adventure!

09:29.069 --> 09:31.320
Brimming with wicked demons,

09:31.321 --> 09:32.905
cutthroat pirates...

09:32.906 --> 09:34.656
No, no, that's not it.

09:34.657 --> 09:36.905
Horror!

09:38.244 --> 09:42.498
Horror! Evil demons!

09:42.499 --> 09:46.085
Wretched monsters! Haunted houses!

09:46.086 --> 09:49.171
Graveyards!

09:49.172 --> 09:51.090
Yes.

09:51.841 --> 09:54.802
It's horror for you, boy.

09:54.803 --> 09:57.846
I'm sure of it.

09:57.847 --> 09:59.390
Your library card, please.

09:59.849 --> 10:01.517
I don't have one.

10:01.518 --> 10:04.016
You do now.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.400
Sign here.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.445
Richard Tyler.

10:13.446 --> 10:17.696
Consider this your passport

10:18.201 --> 10:23.407
to the wonderful, quite
unpredictable world of books.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.290
But I don't want any books.

10:25.291 --> 10:29.128
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I only came in here 'cause of the storm.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.797
You mean you don't need...

10:31.840 --> 10:33.006
Oh.

10:33.007 --> 10:35.710
I see.

10:41.516 --> 10:43.844
Is there a phone where
I can call my parents?

10:44.769 --> 10:46.516
Through there.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.232
Proceed in a
northeasterly direction

10:50.233 --> 10:57.030
until you get to the rotunda, and from there
head west through the fiction section.

10:57.031 --> 11:02.783
And you'll find it. A public
telephone. You can't miss it.

11:13.506 --> 11:16.425
Don't be afraid, boy.
If you lose your way,

11:16.426 --> 11:21.632
merely direct yourself
back to the exit sign.

11:58.009 --> 12:00.553
Wow!

12:33.336 --> 12:35.880
Jeez!

12:47.058 --> 12:48.601
Whoa! Oh!

13:02.824 --> 13:04.199
Hello?

13:18.840 --> 13:20.212
Uh-oh.

13:30.893 --> 13:33.596
Huh?

13:47.910 --> 13:49.703
Oh! Uhh!

14:11.559 --> 14:12.806
Uhh!

14:13.603 --> 14:16.188
Help!

14:16.189 --> 14:19.814
Mister, mister, where's the exit?

14:23.905 --> 14:25.823
Help!

14:37.085 --> 14:38.794
Wha...

14:41.839 --> 14:44.216
Huh?

14:44.217 --> 14:48.138
I'm... I'm a cartoon!

14:48.638 --> 14:52.888
You... are an illustration.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.811
Who... who are you?

14:57.105 --> 14:59.898
I am the Pagemaster,

14:59.899 --> 15:04.696
keeper of the books and
guardian of the written word.

15:06.406 --> 15:09.408
You're the guy from up there!

15:09.409 --> 15:11.159
Where are the others?

15:11.160 --> 15:17.499
Why, they're here,
of course! And all around.

15:17.500 --> 15:20.001
Maybe you can show me the way out?

15:20.002 --> 15:22.379
Follow me.

15:22.380 --> 15:24.965
I-Is that the way?

15:24.966 --> 15:27.669
Oh, the only way.

15:29.679 --> 15:35.100
Fiction, A to Z!
Where all is possible!

15:35.101 --> 15:42.059
Where a boy's imagination can take
root and grow to incredible heights!

15:48.197 --> 15:52.701
Where a boy's courage is a wind
that moves him to discovery!

16:00.209 --> 16:04.004
And where your journey begins!

16:04.005 --> 16:05.130
Uhh!

16:05.131 --> 16:06.715
Whoa!

16:06.716 --> 16:10.760
To find your way home,
you must face three tests,

16:10.761 --> 16:14.682
horror, adventure and fantasy.

16:16.058 --> 16:19.561
And remember this, when in doubt,

16:19.562 --> 16:22.606
look to the books!

16:23.316 --> 16:24.900
Aah! How do you stop this thing?

16:24.901 --> 16:28.111
<i>I am the ghost of Christmas past...</i>

16:28.112 --> 16:30.610
<i>All the pirates shared a grave.</i>

16:38.122 --> 16:41.791
<i>Due to the storm, all lines have
been temporarily disconnected.</i>

16:41.792 --> 16:43.752
<i>Please try your call again later.</i>

16:43.753 --> 16:46.957
Oh! Ow!

16:49.091 --> 16:52.719
This is not good.
Definitely not good at all.

16:54.931 --> 16:59.768
Where's the son of a sea biscuit
knocked me from me crow's nest?

16:59.769 --> 17:02.893
Where's he be? Where's he be?

17:03.231 --> 17:09.655
So here be the lubber who knocked me on
me poop deck, and with no apologies too!

17:13.115 --> 17:15.317
You fiction or nonfiction?

17:15.576 --> 17:17.993
I'm... Richard. Richard Tyler.

17:17.994 --> 17:21.330
- What kind of a book would that be?
- Uh, I'm not a book.

17:21.332 --> 17:24.626
Got any proof?

17:24.627 --> 17:26.962
See? Here's my name!

17:28.214 --> 17:30.423
A library card!

17:30.424 --> 17:34.128
Oh, begging your pardon, lad.
I didn't know you was a customer!

17:35.012 --> 17:37.889
Uh, look, all I wanna
do is get outta here.

17:37.890 --> 17:42.561
Of course you do, matey! We all do.

17:42.562 --> 17:46.517
But this is a library, mate.
Not everything's as it seems.

17:48.401 --> 17:52.862
<i>Look to the books.
Look to the books.</i>

17:56.075 --> 17:58.076
You... you said you
knew the way out?

17:58.077 --> 18:02.247
I know these waters like
the back of me hook!

18:04.000 --> 18:05.622
Uh... Uh...

18:06.794 --> 18:07.919
This way.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.754
I gotta get home.

18:09.755 --> 18:12.757
My parents are probably
worried sick about me.

18:12.758 --> 18:16.177
Well, I'm afeared
I've been dry-docked

18:16.178 --> 18:19.306
in this library far longer
than I'd like to remember.

18:19.307 --> 18:23.059
As I sees it, you with your library
card are me ticket out of here!

18:23.060 --> 18:24.728
Is it a deal, matey?

18:24.729 --> 18:26.521
Ooh, I'm naked.

18:26.522 --> 18:29.357
Uh, yeah, I guess so.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.861
That's the spirit, lad!

18:32.862 --> 18:34.863
Can we get going now?

18:34.864 --> 18:38.283
Aye aye! Let's scale this
mast and get our bearings!

18:38.284 --> 18:44.205
Mast? That's a ladder. I kind
of have this thing about heights.

18:44.206 --> 18:48.918
Huh. I'll take care of that.

18:48.919 --> 18:51.463
<i>Mysterious Island. Yes.</i>

18:51.464 --> 18:52.797
<i>Kidnapped.</i>

18:52.798 --> 18:57.218
Ah, here we be! 20,000
<i>Leagues Under the Sea.</i>

18:57.219 --> 19:00.423
Ah, the squid, yes, that's it!

19:03.351 --> 19:05.393
It's a giant squid!

19:07.063 --> 19:08.264
Ah!

19:09.815 --> 19:11.107
Whoa!

19:11.525 --> 19:12.651
Ohh!

19:12.652 --> 19:14.027
Jump, boy!

19:14.028 --> 19:15.904
It's jump for your life!

19:17.448 --> 19:19.070
Ohh!

19:20.159 --> 19:21.409
Uhh!

19:29.460 --> 19:32.459
Let go of my face! I can't breathe!

19:35.800 --> 19:41.257
What are you doing, grabbing me like
that and messing up my pantyhose?

19:42.473 --> 19:46.267
Hmph! Now I gotta straighten out
my <i>Little Mermaid</i> underwear.

19:46.268 --> 19:48.395
Who... who are you?

19:48.396 --> 19:50.980
I'm Fantasy. Oh!

19:52.400 --> 19:55.399
I'm Fantasy! What is this?

19:55.820 --> 19:56.945
Hm.

19:56.946 --> 19:58.988
It's a library card.

19:58.989 --> 20:00.949
I'm a book, honey. I can read.

20:00.950 --> 20:03.702
Now tell me,

20:03.703 --> 20:07.539
what's the one thing you wish for
more than anything in the world?

20:07.540 --> 20:09.663
Anything in the world?

20:09.709 --> 20:11.793
L-I'd like to get out of here.

20:11.794 --> 20:16.798
I'll grant your wish, child. But you
must do me one small kindness in return.

20:16.799 --> 20:18.758
You gotta check me outta here!

20:18.759 --> 20:21.594
That's it? OK, let's go!

20:21.595 --> 20:24.305
Do I have to click my
heels or something?

20:24.306 --> 20:27.600
Honey, you in the wrong story.

20:27.601 --> 20:31.229
That was a close one, lad. Lad?

20:31.230 --> 20:35.984
Hold on there, missis!
The lad's with me!

20:35.985 --> 20:39.279
- You know that short story?
- Yeah, he's adventure.

20:39.280 --> 20:41.656
Honey, that's what they all say.

20:41.657 --> 20:45.285
I heard that! I'll have
you know I'm a classic!

20:45.286 --> 20:48.204
Mm-hm. A classic... misprint.

20:48.205 --> 20:53.710
Why, you old sea serpent! I'll rip out
your pages and use them for... Oh, no!

20:53.711 --> 20:55.211
Do something!

20:55.212 --> 20:56.337
Hm.

21:00.176 --> 21:06.014
Oops! I forgot. My wand doesn't always
work outside the fantasy section.

21:06.015 --> 21:08.933
You mean you can't
wish us to the exit?

21:08.934 --> 21:13.438
That overdue shrew's never
even seen the exit.

21:13.439 --> 21:15.231
More than you have, shorty!

21:15.232 --> 21:19.110
In fact, the exit's just beyond
my fantasy section. Hmph!

21:19.111 --> 21:21.112
Then what are ye doing
in these parts?

21:21.113 --> 21:23.573
There a witches' convention
around here, maybe?

21:23.574 --> 21:27.869
Look, I was misshelved.

21:27.870 --> 21:33.124
But that's over, now that young Prince
Charming here has come to check me out.

21:33.125 --> 21:36.211
My good eye, he is.
The lad's checking me out!

21:36.212 --> 21:39.214
Come on, boy, we're wasting
time chumming off this dinghy.

21:39.215 --> 21:41.090
It's on to the exit for us!

21:41.091 --> 21:45.678
If he thinks the exit's in that direction,
you know it's got to be in this one!

21:45.679 --> 21:48.681
Don't listen to her, mate. She's
not sailing with a full crew!

21:48.682 --> 21:51.101
Ah-ah-ah!

21:53.062 --> 21:55.688
Fantasy! She's a bloody nightmare.

21:55.689 --> 21:59.275
Let's leave him. He doesn't
even know where we are now!

21:59.276 --> 22:02.403
Bilge water! Of course I
know where we are! We're...

22:02.404 --> 22:06.491
<i>Hound of the Baskervilles.</i>
We're in Baskervilles.

22:06.492 --> 22:07.784
Have a look-see!

22:07.785 --> 22:09.577
Hm. Huh?

22:16.585 --> 22:18.711
Hey, this way! Through here!

22:18.712 --> 22:20.839
Nice doggy! Good doggy!

22:20.840 --> 22:22.417
Hurry!

22:35.938 --> 22:37.605
Oh, baby.

22:37.606 --> 22:39.858
Are we still in the library?

22:39.859 --> 22:42.610
Aye, lad. The horror section.

22:42.611 --> 22:44.863
It looks pretty scary.

22:44.864 --> 22:49.410
That it does. Just stay close to me and...
and you got nothing to worry about.

22:49.535 --> 22:51.203
Mm-hm.

23:05.175 --> 23:08.504
There it is! The exit!

23:16.645 --> 23:20.648
Looks like the only way to reach the
exit is through that there house.

23:20.649 --> 23:22.817
No way I'm going in there.

23:22.985 --> 23:26.487
It's your only chance, boy.
It's just a house.

23:26.488 --> 23:31.194
Yeah, but 70 percent of all
accidents are household-related.

23:37.583 --> 23:42.209
Dr. Jekyll. Mr. Hyde.
Must be a duplex.

23:42.338 --> 23:43.630
Whoa!

23:44.006 --> 23:47.210
Go ahead, matey. I'm...
I'm right behind ye.

23:52.264 --> 23:54.011
Well? Ring the bell.

24:00.230 --> 24:01.522
Ohh!

24:03.233 --> 24:06.194
- Good catch!
- Here, take it.

24:06.195 --> 24:09.572
Isn't he sweet?

24:09.573 --> 24:12.241
Oh, I scared you.

24:12.242 --> 24:13.785
I'm sorry!

24:13.786 --> 24:16.162
You mustn't judge a
book by its cover.

24:16.163 --> 24:19.287
Look, he's smiling!

24:21.001 --> 24:22.669
That's a smile?

24:22.670 --> 24:24.295
All right, teatime's over.

24:24.296 --> 24:27.674
Let's start navigating this house.

24:27.675 --> 24:30.551
Huh? No, wait! Don't go in there!

24:30.552 --> 24:32.846
It's scary inside!

24:33.013 --> 24:35.723
Ha! I ain't afeared of nothing!

24:35.724 --> 24:36.891
I'm afraid.

24:36.892 --> 24:37.976
Of what?

24:37.977 --> 24:40.103
Or, of...

24:40.104 --> 24:42.146
And... Aah!

24:42.147 --> 24:44.232
And...

24:44.233 --> 24:46.356
And...

24:47.611 --> 24:49.779
Uh, I know how you feel.

24:49.780 --> 24:53.741
Horror always has sad endings.

24:53.742 --> 24:56.160
I come from a world
of happy endings.

24:56.161 --> 24:57.954
Why don't you come with us?

24:57.955 --> 25:00.999
Yeah! And maybe you could
help us through the house.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.623
Through the house? Hm.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.288
Uh.

25:05.587 --> 25:06.921
You can do it.

25:06.922 --> 25:08.715
'Kay.

25:10.634 --> 25:11.759
Friend?

25:15.389 --> 25:17.057
Oops!

25:19.435 --> 25:21.103
Come on!

25:26.942 --> 25:28.143
Hm?

25:38.120 --> 25:41.119
He-hello?

25:42.374 --> 25:45.123
A-anybody home?

25:55.345 --> 25:57.639
What was that?

26:00.309 --> 26:02.852
Nevermore!

26:02.853 --> 26:04.851
Get me out of here!

26:13.489 --> 26:16.659
May I assist you in some way?

26:17.493 --> 26:20.453
Oh. Hello there, Mr...?

26:20.454 --> 26:24.079
Doctor. Dr. Jekyll.

26:26.126 --> 26:30.505
Well, sir, we did ring the bell.

26:30.506 --> 26:32.924
It's all my fault. I was
trying to help them

26:32.925 --> 26:35.343
find their way to the
other side of the house.

26:35.344 --> 26:37.762
The other side?

26:37.763 --> 26:43.684
My boy, I derive no pleasure in telling
you that you are in extreme danger.

26:43.685 --> 26:46.104
- Danger?
- Even as we speak.

26:46.105 --> 26:52.904
Lurking in this very room, waiting
to strike, are forces of evil.

26:57.324 --> 26:59.822
Wait for me! Wait for me!

27:05.249 --> 27:10.751
Every man is possessed
of both good... and evil.

27:12.422 --> 27:14.674
Oh, yes.

27:14.675 --> 27:17.970
But enough of that.
Anyone care for a drink?

27:18.220 --> 27:19.421
Hm?

27:25.978 --> 27:27.225
Ah.

27:27.688 --> 27:30.983
I'll have a go with you, doc.

27:31.817 --> 27:33.067
Ooh!

27:33.068 --> 27:35.316
Stay back! This is a man's drink!

27:37.072 --> 27:39.240
Can I have the olive?

27:39.241 --> 27:40.488
Oh!

27:40.576 --> 27:41.826
Uh-oh.

27:41.827 --> 27:43.779
Now look what you've done!

27:46.039 --> 27:47.206
Whoa!

27:47.207 --> 27:48.454
Ooh!

27:50.043 --> 27:55.090
No! No, no! Don't drink it!
Don't, don't!

28:25.579 --> 28:27.702
Dr... Jekyll?

28:27.748 --> 28:30.082
Dr. J?

28:30.083 --> 28:35.004
My name is... Mr. Hyde!

28:39.635 --> 28:41.677
Easy, there!

28:55.984 --> 28:58.486
The stairs, mateys, the stairs!

28:58.487 --> 28:59.779
Ahh!

29:01.448 --> 29:04.367
Help, master! Don't leave me!

29:04.368 --> 29:08.496
This is no way to treat a
library book. Sanctuary!

29:08.497 --> 29:10.244
Sanctuary!

29:15.712 --> 29:18.005
Sanctuary!

29:18.006 --> 29:20.007
Honey, you got to help him!

29:20.008 --> 29:21.384
But I... I...

29:21.385 --> 29:22.882
Oh!

29:24.930 --> 29:28.179
At least this wand is
good for something.

29:33.855 --> 29:35.432
Come on!

29:37.025 --> 29:38.693
Which way?

29:38.694 --> 29:41.028
Down. Definitely down.

29:41.029 --> 29:44.904
No, up. Definitely up! Up, up, up!

29:45.117 --> 29:46.569
Come on!

30:03.176 --> 30:05.344
What's going on?

30:05.345 --> 30:08.472
Ghost stories.

30:10.726 --> 30:12.098
Ha ha!

30:13.270 --> 30:15.598
Get me outta here!

30:18.066 --> 30:20.067
Aah!

30:20.068 --> 30:21.986
Close the door!

30:23.322 --> 30:24.614
Whoa!

30:25.449 --> 30:28.277
Down there? I... I can't.

30:29.244 --> 30:32.747
Come on, boy! Even
books have spines.

30:32.748 --> 30:34.248
Come, master!

30:34.249 --> 30:36.076
I can do this. I can do this.

30:38.420 --> 30:39.997
Aah!

30:40.172 --> 30:41.624
Uhh! Uhh!

30:45.886 --> 30:48.846
<i>Reach deep within
yourself, Richard.</i>

30:48.847 --> 30:50.431
<i>Seize the courage.</i>

30:50.432 --> 30:51.929
Uhh! Uhh!

30:52.684 --> 30:54.727
Whoa!

30:54.728 --> 30:59.023
- Yay! You did it! You did it!
- Grand, boy!

31:02.611 --> 31:04.484
Hooray, hooray, hooray.

31:05.405 --> 31:07.653
Wow.

31:17.125 --> 31:22.172
Do ya smell it?
Breathe it in, mateys.

31:24.466 --> 31:25.925
Ha ha!

31:25.926 --> 31:29.178
The land of adventure!

31:29.179 --> 31:31.677
Look! There's the exit!

31:48.490 --> 31:51.239
Hey! Wait for me!

31:53.495 --> 31:54.829
Ha ha ha!

31:54.830 --> 31:58.124
Home, sweet home!

31:58.125 --> 32:02.000
There's only room for one up here.

32:03.547 --> 32:07.251
From now on, it'll
be smooth sailin'!

32:10.011 --> 32:11.720
What are ya laughin' at?

32:14.182 --> 32:15.508
Whoa!

32:16.143 --> 32:17.390
Uhh!

32:18.103 --> 32:19.771
A boat!

32:21.940 --> 32:24.316
Is it... safe?

32:24.317 --> 32:29.023
I wrote the book on sailin'. In
fact, I am the book on sailin'.

32:30.907 --> 32:32.575
I'm impressed.

32:35.120 --> 32:37.371
We're sinking. We're going down!

32:37.372 --> 32:39.039
Somebody do something!

32:43.879 --> 32:45.331
Thank you.

32:45.714 --> 32:48.417
Shove off, lads!

32:54.890 --> 32:58.017
Jeez, the water looks
kind of choppy.

32:58.018 --> 33:01.597
Maybe we should've stayed
back there where it was safe.

33:10.197 --> 33:11.865
Whalin' men.

33:13.617 --> 33:16.696
It's Cap'n Ahab, it is!

33:19.748 --> 33:21.957
Another guy with a peg leg.

33:21.958 --> 33:26.086
Mm-hm. Seems to be a fashion
statement around here.

33:26.087 --> 33:29.423
- Did you see it?
- See what?

33:29.424 --> 33:32.301
The devil of the deep.
The white whale.

33:32.302 --> 33:34.470
- Hm?
- Moby Dick!

33:37.641 --> 33:40.936
Thar she blows!

33:43.438 --> 33:48.108
I grin at thee,
thou grinning whale!

33:48.109 --> 33:50.152
He's possessed!

33:50.153 --> 33:51.605
He's insane!

33:51.655 --> 33:53.949
He's my kind of guy!

33:56.785 --> 33:58.118
Look!

33:58.119 --> 34:00.037
It's headed straight for them!

34:00.121 --> 34:03.541
Thou damned whale!

34:03.542 --> 34:06.835
Thus, I give up the spear!

34:13.802 --> 34:16.050
So, you think I scared it?

34:16.179 --> 34:20.849
He shouldn't swim right after
eating, you know. He'll get cramps.

34:20.850 --> 34:22.677
Where did he go?

34:23.520 --> 34:24.812
Aah!

34:25.355 --> 34:28.357
Row! Row for your lives!

34:51.630 --> 34:54.710
Guys! Where are you?

35:06.021 --> 35:09.976
Adventure? Boy, am I
ever glad to see you.

35:13.903 --> 35:15.237
Huh?

35:15.238 --> 35:17.657
All right, all right!

35:17.699 --> 35:19.408
Where's Horror?

35:19.409 --> 35:22.032
And Fantasy?

35:26.333 --> 35:28.375
Where are they?

35:28.376 --> 35:30.878
I searched for 'em as
much as I could, mate.

35:30.879 --> 35:35.550
I'm afraid... I'm afraid they've
gone below with Davy Jones.

35:35.675 --> 35:38.424
No. It can't be.

35:46.353 --> 35:49.438
You guys are the only
friends I've ever had.

35:53.234 --> 35:55.937
She's a cruel sea, lad.

35:58.156 --> 36:01.033
They gotta be out there.

36:01.034 --> 36:03.487
Horror!

36:04.496 --> 36:06.039
Fantasy!

36:08.458 --> 36:10.251
Sharks!

36:12.754 --> 36:15.833
We may be joining them other
two sooner than you think.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.299
Hey, look!

36:20.387 --> 36:23.722
Help, help! Over here!

36:23.723 --> 36:27.017
Careful, mate. Not all
sharks are in the water.

36:27.018 --> 36:29.641
Get us out of here!

36:29.896 --> 36:31.939
This way! Help!

36:37.237 --> 36:40.364
It's a good thing you
guys came along.

36:40.365 --> 36:45.285
Ohh! We're missing two others
about his size. Did you see 'em?

36:45.286 --> 36:47.739
He's all the catch we've had today.

36:58.883 --> 37:00.380
Huh?

37:21.114 --> 37:22.823
I knew it! It's him!

37:22.824 --> 37:24.074
Who?

37:24.075 --> 37:28.530
The meanest, black-hearted pirate
that ever sailed the seven seas.

37:28.663 --> 37:30.748
Long John Silver!

37:36.087 --> 37:38.210
Just set your keel down, mate.

37:38.298 --> 37:40.796
John Silver's expecting
live company.

37:47.515 --> 37:48.762
Uhh!

37:54.147 --> 37:59.151
Give the word, Cap'n Silver, sir, and
I'll show you the color of his insides.

37:59.152 --> 38:01.696
Red! Red! They're red!

38:02.405 --> 38:05.699
Stow your cutlass, Tom Morgan.

38:05.700 --> 38:08.619
I want a better look
at his outsides first.

38:08.620 --> 38:10.621
Long John Silver!

38:10.622 --> 38:12.790
Aye, lad, the very same.

38:12.791 --> 38:18.623
Well, seeing as how me men plucked you out
of the water like a drownin' field rat,

38:18.713 --> 38:21.840
you'll be joinin' our happy family

38:21.841 --> 38:25.090
as our new cabin boy.

38:25.136 --> 38:28.722
Thanks, but I already
have a family.

38:28.723 --> 38:30.641
I really should be
getting home now.

38:30.642 --> 38:33.436
Oh, I think you are home.
Heh heh heh heh.

38:34.270 --> 38:39.852
John Silver! Touch one hair on that boy's
head, and you'll be answerin' to me!

38:41.820 --> 38:44.773
Well, come aboard, matey! Ha ha.

38:46.115 --> 38:47.407
Uhh!

38:50.245 --> 38:54.581
You wouldn't happen to be going
after me treasure, would you, now?

38:54.582 --> 38:57.751
You ain't got any treasure
worth goin' after!

38:57.752 --> 38:59.920
- No treasure?
- No treasure?

38:59.921 --> 39:03.173
He's lyin'! There's plenty
of treasure for all of ya!

39:03.174 --> 39:04.341
Search him!

39:04.342 --> 39:06.343
The boy, too.

39:16.396 --> 39:17.479
Hm.

39:17.480 --> 39:18.897
Why, looky here.

39:19.023 --> 39:21.191
Here he be, Cap'n.

39:21.192 --> 39:23.443
What might this here be?

39:23.444 --> 39:25.612
Money! It's yours! Keep it!

39:25.613 --> 39:29.241
- Money, he says!
- Keep it, he says!

39:32.453 --> 39:36.164
- Hm. Library card.
- Library card?

39:36.165 --> 39:38.750
A cabin boy don't
need no library card.

39:42.463 --> 39:45.007
I'd like to get out of here!

39:47.051 --> 39:50.304
Land ho!

39:50.305 --> 39:53.930
Land ho!

39:55.810 --> 39:57.933
There she be, mateys!

39:58.104 --> 40:00.477
Treasure Island!

40:15.330 --> 40:19.291
Stay on your toes, mate. When they go
for the gold, we'll make our break.

40:19.292 --> 40:20.959
Quit your squawkin'!

40:20.960 --> 40:23.295
Look to the map. What's it say?

40:23.296 --> 40:27.421
It's, uh, in the middle,
by the waterfall.

40:27.926 --> 40:30.719
No, it's east by some broccoli.

40:30.720 --> 40:32.721
- Give me that!
- Broccoli.

40:32.722 --> 40:36.017
You half-wits!
It's west, by a tree!

40:37.185 --> 40:39.519
East, by broccoli!

40:39.520 --> 40:42.644
They're all idiots.

40:45.401 --> 40:48.946
What sort of way is
that for bones to lie?

40:48.947 --> 40:51.073
It ain't natural.

40:51.074 --> 40:54.242
This island's haunted.
It's accursed, it is!

40:54.243 --> 40:56.662
Oh, you're all yellow dogs.

40:56.663 --> 41:01.118
Open your eyes. The bones is the compass
pointin' the way to the doubloons.

41:09.550 --> 41:11.878
It's gone!

41:12.720 --> 41:14.721
Dig deeper, boys!

41:14.722 --> 41:19.059
I say, dig deeper!
Find the treasure!

41:19.060 --> 41:23.730
One gold piece. This is
your treasure, is it?

41:23.731 --> 41:26.400
Let's kill him and eat his parrot.

41:26.401 --> 41:28.068
Stand by for trouble.

41:28.069 --> 41:31.571
We mighta known you'd
double-cross us.

41:32.782 --> 41:36.368
Throw down your
weapons, John Silver!

41:36.369 --> 41:39.955
Why, you pack of back-bitin' dogs!

41:39.956 --> 41:42.958
You'll be regrettin'
this, George Merry.

41:42.959 --> 41:47.539
Save your speeches.
Dead men don't bite.

41:51.092 --> 41:55.595
16 men on a dead man's stomach...

41:55.596 --> 41:57.931
No! No! Chest! Chest!

41:57.932 --> 41:59.433
Chest! Chest!

42:01.436 --> 42:05.939
Yo, ho, ho and a bottle of rum!

42:05.940 --> 42:08.814
Evil spirits.

42:09.360 --> 42:10.902
Sanctuary!

42:12.280 --> 42:13.447
Ohh.

42:13.448 --> 42:15.782
Horror! You're alive!

42:15.783 --> 42:18.702
Not for long. Hee hee hee hee hee!

42:18.703 --> 42:20.155
Aah!

42:20.288 --> 42:21.865
Ohh!

42:22.707 --> 42:24.159
Ohh-Ohh!

42:24.167 --> 42:26.085
Ahchoo!

42:31.841 --> 42:33.213
Fantasy!

42:33.634 --> 42:39.264
Naturally. Well, who were you
expecting, honey, the tooth fairy?

42:39.265 --> 42:40.512
Get them!

42:41.517 --> 42:43.845
Ha ha! At last, a good fight!

42:44.145 --> 42:45.312
Aah!

42:45.313 --> 42:46.560
Uhh!

42:46.939 --> 42:48.857
Get me outta here!

42:58.451 --> 43:00.243
Hey!

43:00.244 --> 43:01.912
Why, you...

43:10.088 --> 43:11.380
Uhh!

43:15.426 --> 43:18.428
Get the boat, boy. We're
gonna be shovin' off.

43:18.429 --> 43:20.097
I'm not going with you.

43:20.098 --> 43:22.432
The sword, honey. Get the sword.

43:22.433 --> 43:26.770
Don't even think it, boy.
He ain't got the heart.

43:29.190 --> 43:30.733
Hyah! Uhh!

43:32.318 --> 43:33.860
Stay back!

43:33.861 --> 43:35.862
Avast there, laddie.

43:35.863 --> 43:39.157
Somebody could get hurt with
that blade you got thar.

43:39.158 --> 43:40.951
Be careful, master.

43:40.952 --> 43:43.120
In the boat.

43:43.121 --> 43:47.207
Huh? Easy now, matey.
Easy. I'm goin'.

43:47.208 --> 43:50.919
Right ye are.
Into the boat, aye aye.

43:50.920 --> 43:54.670
Ye be a hard lad, Richard Tyler.

44:01.764 --> 44:04.558
Good sailin' to ya, shipmate.

44:04.559 --> 44:08.270
<i>15 men on a dead man's chest</i>

44:08.271 --> 44:11.600
<i>Yo, ho, ho and a bottle of rum</i>

44:13.901 --> 44:15.986
- Way to go, honey.
- Yes!

44:17.697 --> 44:21.322
Whew. Oh, I wish my
dad coulda seen me.

44:21.325 --> 44:23.698
Boy, I thought you two were goners.

44:23.786 --> 44:25.162
We almost were,

44:25.163 --> 44:28.498
until this enchanting fellow
discovered he could float.

44:28.499 --> 44:31.501
It's hollow.

44:34.338 --> 44:35.922
- Who's there?
- Adventure!

44:35.923 --> 44:37.382
Adventure who?

44:37.383 --> 44:41.963
What do you mean, Adventure who?
Open the blasted door, you dog-eared...

44:42.263 --> 44:43.510
Aah!

44:45.558 --> 44:47.431
Perfect timing.

44:48.519 --> 44:51.021
I was just thanking these
guys for saving us.

44:52.440 --> 44:56.359
I coulda taken the lot of 'em with
one hand tied behind me back!

44:56.360 --> 44:59.484
That's just his way
of saying thanks.

45:02.033 --> 45:04.452
You're welcome!

45:08.289 --> 45:09.664
Ahoy, matey!

45:09.665 --> 45:13.085
Aye, we're lusty adventurous men.

45:13.252 --> 45:16.713
Go away. You don't know
what you're talkin' about.

45:16.714 --> 45:19.883
L-I know I'm not your
favorite kind of book,

45:19.884 --> 45:21.635
but I could be just like you.

45:21.636 --> 45:23.511
You'll never be Adventure!

45:23.512 --> 45:25.972
Ye ain't got the spine for it.

45:25.973 --> 45:28.475
And take that stupid thing off!

45:28.476 --> 45:30.393
Sorry.

45:30.394 --> 45:32.392
Thinks he can be a pirate!

45:47.787 --> 45:52.959
<i>Seize the courage, Richard,
then you will reach the exit.</i>

45:53.334 --> 45:55.787
I'll never get home.

45:56.337 --> 45:58.414
You did good, honey.

46:00.007 --> 46:04.344
I lost the library card.
I can't check anybody out.

46:04.345 --> 46:06.388
We'll never get to the exit now.

46:06.389 --> 46:09.763
Honey, never say "never"
around Fantasy,

46:09.850 --> 46:14.145
because sometimes you've got to
fight to make a wish come true.

46:14.146 --> 46:17.357
So come on. Don't quit on me now.

46:17.358 --> 46:19.026
Yeah.

46:20.361 --> 46:23.154
Huh! That crazy hunchbook. Ahh.

46:23.155 --> 46:25.733
You don't see me
pretending to be Horror.

46:35.334 --> 46:39.921
Why are you sittin' around like a
bunch of 0l' wenches at teatime?

46:39.922 --> 46:41.548
Pick one.

46:41.549 --> 46:42.921
Mmm...

46:43.634 --> 46:45.051
That one.

46:46.387 --> 46:48.013
My library card!

46:48.014 --> 46:51.599
I wrestled it away from three sharks
who was eyein' it for breakfast.

46:51.600 --> 46:54.144
At no small threat
to me life, neither.

46:54.228 --> 46:55.600
Mm-hm.

46:55.730 --> 46:58.940
Where's Horror? Wasn't he with you?

46:58.941 --> 47:02.987
He was, but he, uh... I mean,
I sort of, uh... He, uh...

47:03.237 --> 47:05.071
What did you say to him now?

47:05.072 --> 47:08.196
Well, I, uh... I, uh...
I just, uh, uh...

47:08.451 --> 47:09.576
I'll go find him.

47:09.577 --> 47:12.872
Yeah, you better go find him.
And be quick about it!

47:14.165 --> 47:16.958
Horror!

47:16.959 --> 47:19.794
Horror!

47:19.795 --> 47:21.588
Horror!

47:21.589 --> 47:23.923
Horror.

47:33.142 --> 47:36.144
Hang on, mate! I'm coming!

47:38.814 --> 47:43.815
You're lucky I was published
with a thick hide!

47:43.944 --> 47:45.145
Hm?

47:48.657 --> 47:51.201
Come back, ya jellyfish!

47:56.457 --> 47:59.584
Speak to me, mate.

47:59.585 --> 48:05.918
Ye had a good heart and ye
was braver than ye knew.

48:06.342 --> 48:13.056
I... I'd walk the plank if I
thought it would bring ye back.

48:13.057 --> 48:15.308
That's beautiful.

48:15.309 --> 48:16.476
Huh?

48:16.477 --> 48:18.600
This is too cute.

48:19.313 --> 48:20.480
Uhh!

48:20.481 --> 48:21.815
Are you OK?

48:21.816 --> 48:24.025
Thanks to my friend here.

48:24.026 --> 48:26.604
Get off me!

48:27.321 --> 48:28.613
Did you see that?

48:28.614 --> 48:29.906
See what?

48:29.907 --> 48:32.158
My wand! It's blinkin'!

48:32.159 --> 48:33.952
That can only mean one thing.

48:33.953 --> 48:35.078
The exit!

48:35.079 --> 48:37.497
- The checkout!
- A happy ending.

48:37.498 --> 48:38.745
Ohh!

48:46.215 --> 48:48.042
Let's go! Come on!

48:48.676 --> 48:52.846
Are you sure that swizzle stick
of yours is workin' right?

48:52.847 --> 48:53.930
Hm.

48:53.931 --> 48:56.975
I don't know. Maybe
we should test it.

49:03.858 --> 49:07.688
You've gone overboard, missis!

49:24.211 --> 49:28.712
<i>Whatever you imagine</i>

49:29.884 --> 49:33.759
<i>Is where your heart can go</i>

49:34.388 --> 49:37.015
<i>There are worlds
filled with treasure</i>

49:37.016 --> 49:39.601
<i>Time without measure</i>

49:39.602 --> 49:46.777
<i>To learn whatever you
may need to know</i>

49:48.360 --> 49:49.694
<i>Imagine</i>

49:49.695 --> 49:50.862
<i>Imagine</i>

49:50.863 --> 49:53.490
<i>You and I could fly...</i>

49:53.491 --> 49:56.661
- Look! Mother Goose!
- Hey, girl!

49:57.495 --> 50:03.208
<i>And leave all our doubts
and fears behind...</i>

50:03.209 --> 50:06.544
Hello, my little baby. Hi!

50:06.545 --> 50:11.090
<i>You see, that's just
what can happen</i>

50:11.091 --> 50:15.171
<i>If you look inside your mind</i>

50:15.429 --> 50:19.849
<i>There's no limit to the wonders</i>

50:19.850 --> 50:24.601
<i>You can find</i>

50:25.147 --> 50:30.818
<i>Whatever you imagine</i>

50:30.819 --> 50:35.532
<i>Can make your life brand-new</i>

50:35.533 --> 50:37.825
<i>There are miracles waiting</i>

50:37.826 --> 50:41.037
<i>So keep concentrating</i>

50:41.038 --> 50:47.085
<i>And I promise you that if you do</i>

50:49.255 --> 50:55.635
<i>Whatever you imagine can come true</i>

50:55.636 --> 50:57.634
Wait for me!

51:01.141 --> 51:05.517
Hey! Come here!
Those are my glasses!

51:06.772 --> 51:08.856
Hey! Don't go up there!

51:08.857 --> 51:12.687
What's the matter? Is
Adventure afraid to go in?

51:13.028 --> 51:17.529
What? I live for moments like this.

51:28.877 --> 51:32.046
Look! There it is! The exit!

51:37.928 --> 51:40.222
Me sword! Uhh!

51:50.357 --> 51:53.185
Earthquake!

52:33.901 --> 52:36.775
Quick! Find page 1,001.

52:38.822 --> 52:40.073
<i>Arabian Nights?</i>

52:40.074 --> 52:41.616
That's it!

52:41.617 --> 52:42.909
Ohh!

52:45.746 --> 52:47.948
Get the boy!

53:02.513 --> 53:05.890
Come on! The exit's up there!

53:22.449 --> 53:23.866
We're gonna make it!

53:23.867 --> 53:27.162
- Hooray! We're gonna make...
- Aah! My wand!

53:28.622 --> 53:31.917
Oh, baby. I wish that
hadn't happened.

53:55.983 --> 53:58.276
Come on, guys! The exit!

54:00.320 --> 54:01.988
This way, guys!

54:11.665 --> 54:12.957
Aah!

54:15.627 --> 54:18.250
We're almost there!

54:27.473 --> 54:29.550
We made it!

54:32.019 --> 54:33.766
Guys?

54:37.608 --> 54:39.902
This dragon is history!

54:40.027 --> 54:42.104
Don't try to stop me!

54:44.448 --> 54:46.241
Be careful.

54:46.325 --> 54:48.243
Huh? Hm.

54:54.374 --> 54:56.827
You really are a classic.

55:04.259 --> 55:05.676
Mmm!

55:08.972 --> 55:11.891
How would you like to
curl up with a good book?

55:14.228 --> 55:16.395
Oh, me binding!

55:16.396 --> 55:19.023
In your dreams!

55:19.024 --> 55:20.271
Ooh!

55:20.442 --> 55:23.270
Adventure, up here!

55:23.570 --> 55:26.989
Go on, lad! Save yourself!

55:26.990 --> 55:30.368
You think a bag of hot air
is enough to stop me?

55:30.369 --> 55:34.745
Dragon? He's more like
a dragonfly, he is!

55:34.998 --> 55:36.450
Look out!

55:47.594 --> 55:48.886
Uhh.

55:49.763 --> 55:51.806
Happy birthday.

56:10.033 --> 56:14.113
Hang on, guys! I'm coming!

56:15.080 --> 56:16.372
A sword.

56:34.808 --> 56:36.510
Yes!

56:42.774 --> 56:46.228
Ha ha! That's it, boy!
Go for the gizzard!

56:48.780 --> 56:50.823
Bite him, bite him!

56:56.455 --> 56:57.702
Aah!

56:59.708 --> 57:01.000
Yah!

57:03.211 --> 57:06.836
- Watch out for his tail!
- You've got him on the run!

57:07.007 --> 57:08.254
Aah!

57:17.935 --> 57:20.144
I'm not scared of you!

57:20.145 --> 57:21.392
Aah!

57:26.610 --> 57:28.812
Aah!

57:32.240 --> 57:33.692
Huh?

57:38.288 --> 57:39.538
Aah!

57:42.751 --> 57:45.211
I gotta get out of here.

57:47.214 --> 57:49.792
Aah!

57:51.510 --> 57:53.462
Fantasy's wand!

57:57.808 --> 58:01.686
This is not good.
Definitely not good at all.

58:01.687 --> 58:02.853
Uh-oh.

58:02.854 --> 58:06.357
<i>Look to the books.
Look to the books.</i>

58:06.358 --> 58:08.442
Look to the books.

58:08.443 --> 58:10.194
Look to the books!

58:10.195 --> 58:13.319
<i>Alice in Wonderland.</i>

58:14.408 --> 58:16.784
Off with his head!

58:16.785 --> 58:18.202
Sheesh!

58:19.496 --> 58:20.948
Mnh-mnh.

58:22.040 --> 58:23.457
Mnh-mnh.

58:24.001 --> 58:26.544
<i>Jack and the Beanstalk.</i>

58:26.545 --> 58:28.964
Yeah! This is it!

58:39.474 --> 58:43.850
I hate heights!

58:47.983 --> 58:49.275
Aah!

58:49.735 --> 58:51.610
Matey!

58:51.611 --> 58:53.404
He's alive!

58:53.405 --> 58:54.652
Aah!

58:56.366 --> 58:58.034
Come on, guys!

58:59.286 --> 59:00.411
Uhh!

59:16.178 --> 59:17.344
Whew.

59:17.345 --> 59:19.305
Are you all right?

59:19.306 --> 59:21.057
Wh... wha...

59:21.058 --> 59:23.886
Master, you saved us!

59:24.019 --> 59:26.688
That ya did, matey.

59:29.191 --> 59:32.568
Baby, you're the greatest.

59:32.569 --> 59:33.986
Mm-wah!

01:00:01.014 --> 01:00:02.841
Who's there?

01:00:06.686 --> 01:00:09.514
The Pagemaster.

01:00:09.731 --> 01:00:12.650
Hey! How'd you get here?

01:00:12.859 --> 01:00:17.029
Quit it! We're in the
presence of the Pagemaster.

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:21.325
I know who he is! He's the
guy who did all this to me!

01:00:21.326 --> 01:00:24.203
Do you have any idea
what I've been through?

01:00:24.204 --> 01:00:25.871
Tell me.

01:00:25.872 --> 01:00:29.542
I was nearly torn apart
by a crazy doctor.

01:00:29.543 --> 01:00:33.003
I was made a slave by a
bunch of mangy pirates,

01:00:33.004 --> 01:00:37.508
and eaten, got that, eaten
by a fire-breathing dragon!

01:00:37.509 --> 01:00:41.554
He don't mean it, my
Pagemaster. He don't mean it.

01:00:41.555 --> 01:00:47.888
Not to mention being tossed, squashed
and scared practically to death.

01:00:49.062 --> 01:00:51.230
Yet you stand before me.

01:00:52.232 --> 01:00:55.276
Well... yeah.

01:00:55.277 --> 01:00:59.196
Think, boy! What kind of an
adventure would you have had

01:00:59.197 --> 01:01:02.741
if I'd brought you here
with the turn of a page?

01:01:10.041 --> 01:01:12.289
You prevailed over evil.

01:01:15.213 --> 01:01:19.008
Ah, you looked Moby
Dick in the eye, boy.

01:01:21.303 --> 01:01:28.309
Ah, you had pirates tough, me lad, and
don't no one speak any different.

01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:30.811
If I had brought you
here from the start,

01:01:30.812 --> 01:01:35.313
you never would have found the
courage to face your own fears.

01:01:43.909 --> 01:01:49.866
And in doing so, you
triumph here and always.

01:01:54.294 --> 01:01:56.837
Hey, is that... That's me!

01:01:56.838 --> 01:01:59.840
That was you.

01:01:59.841 --> 01:02:02.426
I'm ready to go home now.

01:02:05.263 --> 01:02:08.342
I mean, we're ready.

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:14.146
The world awaits.

01:02:14.147 --> 01:02:15.481
Whoa!

01:02:15.482 --> 01:02:17.983
Godspeed to you, boy!

01:02:17.984 --> 01:02:20.687
Wait for me!

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.577
Aah!

01:02:58.024 --> 01:03:00.647
You took quite a spill, young man.

01:03:01.528 --> 01:03:03.230
Huh?

01:03:05.031 --> 01:03:07.233
Are you all right?

01:03:16.751 --> 01:03:18.919
Careful! You'll slip again!

01:03:22.966 --> 01:03:25.926
Hey, wait a minute! Wait a minute!

01:03:25.927 --> 01:03:28.721
Wait! Uh, I forgot something.

01:03:28.763 --> 01:03:31.261
Here.

01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:38.185
I'm afraid you can
only check out two.

01:03:39.232 --> 01:03:41.981
Horror? But I promised him.

01:03:43.361 --> 01:03:45.905
You promised whom?

01:03:46.573 --> 01:03:50.027
- Look, I need... Just this once?
- Shh.

01:03:51.411 --> 01:03:55.115
I have a talent for
guessing what people need.

01:03:57.083 --> 01:03:59.581
Just this once.

01:04:01.212 --> 01:04:02.459
Shh.

01:04:54.682 --> 01:04:56.759
Yes!

01:05:02.273 --> 01:05:06.148
Good. That was definitely good.

01:05:09.864 --> 01:05:13.826
I can't imagine where he could be.
Maybe we should call the police.

01:05:13.827 --> 01:05:15.700
Alan!

01:05:17.914 --> 01:05:19.866
He's home.

01:05:24.504 --> 01:05:26.505
Alan.

01:05:26.506 --> 01:05:28.132
It's impossible.

01:05:37.016 --> 01:05:38.638
Rich?

01:05:51.030 --> 01:05:53.157
We probably should
put him in his bed.

01:05:53.158 --> 01:05:55.531
Let's let him sleep
up here tonight.

01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:12.260
Love you, Richie.

01:06:27.275 --> 01:06:29.273
Good night, son.

01:06:40.371 --> 01:06:45.327
It's dark out here. I wish
there was a night-light.

01:06:45.376 --> 01:06:48.125
Honey, wish granted.

01:06:48.546 --> 01:06:50.623
Ooh.

01:06:54.093 --> 01:06:56.387
Hooray! Hooray!

01:06:57.472 --> 01:07:00.390
Breathe it in, mateys.

01:07:00.391 --> 01:07:04.971
This be the land of adventure.
You can lay to that.

01:07:11.736 --> 01:07:14.780
Come here, handsome.
Why you cryin'?

01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:18.781
Because I have friends.

01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:23.872
That you do, matey.

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:27.167
Aye, that you do.

01:07:27.168 --> 01:07:28.377
Ahem.

01:07:28.378 --> 01:07:31.797
You know what would make
this a happy ending?

01:07:31.798 --> 01:07:33.715
A kiss.

01:07:33.716 --> 01:07:35.300
OK.

01:07:38.513 --> 01:07:40.889
I meant from her!

01:07:45.353 --> 01:07:47.772
<i>When this world</i>

01:07:48.606 --> 01:07:50.524
<i>The real-life world</i>

01:07:50.525 --> 01:07:52.150
<i>You're livin' in</i>

01:07:52.151 --> 01:07:54.979
<i>Just gets too much</i>

01:07:55.989 --> 01:08:00.659
<i>For you to take</i>

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:03.329
<i>When you find</i>

01:08:03.663 --> 01:08:07.868
<i>Too many troubles on your mind</i>

01:08:08.167 --> 01:08:10.711
<i>And feel just like</i>

01:08:11.004 --> 01:08:14.128
<i>There's no escape</i>

01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:17.175
<i>And it seems your heart's forgotten</i>

01:08:17.176 --> 01:08:20.554
<i>How to believe</i>

01:08:20.555 --> 01:08:23.348
<i>Turn a page in your soul</i>

01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:27.895
<i>Mmm, there's a place you can go</i>

01:08:28.438 --> 01:08:32.189
<i>Close your eyes and let your heart</i>

01:08:32.191 --> 01:08:33.567
<i>Fly free</i>

01:08:33.568 --> 01:08:36.237
<i>Fly free</i>

01:08:36.571 --> 01:08:40.116
<i>Dream away, dream away</i>

01:08:40.658 --> 01:08:44.161
<i>Let imagination light your way</i>

01:08:44.162 --> 01:08:45.953
<i>Take you as far</i>

01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:49.791
<i>As your heart can see</i>

01:08:49.792 --> 01:08:51.710
<i>Dream</i>

01:08:51.711 --> 01:08:55.415
<i>Dream away, dream away</i>

01:08:56.381 --> 01:09:00.926
<i>To a place where hope is shining</i>

01:09:00.928 --> 01:09:02.595
<i>Find your silver lining</i>

01:09:02.596 --> 01:09:04.973
<i>Find your silver lining</i>

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:06.683
<i>Everything you need</i>

01:09:06.684 --> 01:09:08.225
<i>Everything is...</i>

01:09:08.227 --> 01:09:14.981
<i>Just a dream away</i>

01:09:18.529 --> 01:09:20.781
<i>Ooh</i>

01:09:20.782 --> 01:09:22.573
<i>Remember when</i>

01:09:22.575 --> 01:09:24.242
<i>Remember when</i>

01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:27.203
<i>A dream could take you anywhere</i>

01:09:27.205 --> 01:09:28.580
<i>Anywhere you want to</i>

01:09:28.581 --> 01:09:31.291
<i>Just a wish</i>

01:09:31.292 --> 01:09:34.502
<i>Anything could be</i>

01:09:34.504 --> 01:09:40.759
<i>When the farthest star was one
more star you could reach</i>

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:43.595
<i>Take a look in your heart</i>

01:09:43.595 --> 01:09:48.600
<i>'Cause that's where
dreams always start</i>

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:51.185
<i>Anything is real</i>

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:53.270
<i>If you just believe</i>

01:09:53.272 --> 01:09:54.856
<i>Believe, believe</i>

01:09:54.857 --> 01:09:56.942
<i>Ohh, Ohh, ohh</i>

01:09:56.943 --> 01:10:00.946
<i>Dream away, dream away</i>

01:10:00.947 --> 01:10:04.449
<i>Let imagination light your way</i>

01:10:04.450 --> 01:10:06.284

01:10:28.558 --> 01:10:33.104
<i>Just a dream away</i>

01:10:33.312 --> 01:10:38.564
<i>All it takes is faith to
make your dreams come true</i>

01:10:38.693 --> 01:10:40.610
<i>Oh, oh</i>

01:10:40.611 --> 01:10:42.237
<i>And somewhere in this world</i>

01:10:42.238 --> 01:10:44.156
<i>There'll be somebody</i>

01:10:44.157 --> 01:10:47.951
<i>To share your dreams</i>

01:10:47.952 --> 01:10:51.998
<i>With you</i>

01:10:52.457 --> 01:10:54.830
<i>Hey</i>

01:10:57.670 --> 01:10:59.963
<i>Yeah, oh, yeah</i>

01:10:59.964 --> 01:11:01.047

<i>Oh, yeah, oh</i>

01:11:03.009 --> 01:11:07.179
<i>Dream away, dream away</i>

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:10.599
<i>Let imagination light your way</i>

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.517

<i>There are dreams to awaken</i>

01:12:31.222 --> 01:12:34.099

<i>There are worlds
filled with treasure</i>

<i>Time without measure</i>

01:12:57.790 --> 01:12:59.875

<i>You and I</i>

01:13:11.178 --> 01:13:15.599
<i>Could fly past the sun</i>

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:20.979
<i>And leave all our doubts and fears</i>

01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:24.524
<i>Behind us</i>

01:13:24.525 --> 01:13:29.321
<i>You see, that's just
what can happen</i>
