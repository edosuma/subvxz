01:10.737 --> 01:12.796
Ugh!

01:12.872 --> 01:15.636
Large caliber, .45, I'd say.

01:15.708 --> 01:17.699
Fired within half a meter.

01:19.546 --> 01:22.538
All of them executed
in the same fashion.

01:22.615 --> 01:25.209
Jojo, how many did you say?

01:25.285 --> 01:28.186
[Speaking French]

01:28.254 --> 01:29.619
Ten, maybe.

01:29.689 --> 01:32.317
It's very brave of you
to come forward.

01:35.595 --> 01:36.892
It's gonna be dark soon.

01:36.963 --> 01:38.658
Well, then,
let's not waste time.

01:38.731 --> 01:42.724
We've still got to examine
that site on the opposite bank.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.935
Looks to be another mass grave.

02:04.858 --> 02:06.951
Oh, my God.

05:20.586 --> 05:24.420
Tim, Roger wants to see
you ASAP.

05:24.490 --> 05:27.288
That was quick.

05:28.861 --> 05:30.886
Nice working with you.

05:35.535 --> 05:36.729
- Bob.
- Yeah?

05:36.803 --> 05:38.964
You need a new cameraman?

05:39.038 --> 05:42.496
I'm just joking, Tim.
Seriously.

05:42.575 --> 05:46.136
<i>A crocodile attack has claimed</i>
<i>the life of world-renowned...</i>

05:46.212 --> 05:49.739
You can't be serious about
Porter. The guy's a parasite.

05:49.816 --> 05:52.284
Not now.
We'll talk about it later.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.343
You know Aviva Masters?

05:55.888 --> 05:59.153
Sure. The animal reporter.

06:01.527 --> 06:04.018
Sorry. I didn't mean that
to sound condescending.

06:04.097 --> 06:09.262
I liked your piece on feline
leukemia. My mom, she has a cat.

06:10.870 --> 06:13.202
Been following
the Catherine Andrews story?

06:13.272 --> 06:15.467

06:15.541 --> 06:17.873
<i>... a scene of unspeakable carnage.</i>

06:17.944 --> 06:20.936
It's a Grimm's fairy tale.

06:21.013 --> 06:23.607
- comes in the night...
- Gustave?

06:23.683 --> 06:27.244
Gustave. It's what the locals
call him. He's a legend.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.311
Mm.

06:31.324 --> 06:33.417
Want me to produce a story
on this crocodile?

06:33.493 --> 06:35.427
Yeah, and I want you to capture it.

06:35.495 --> 06:37.292
[Laughs]

06:40.600 --> 06:41.999
What?

06:42.068 --> 06:44.127
Matt Collins is a top croc expert.

06:44.203 --> 06:46.364
He's designed and built
a special steel cage.

06:46.439 --> 06:48.737
He says he can
take Gustave alive.

06:48.808 --> 06:50.969
<i>They show signs</i>
<i>of remarkable intelligence.</i>

06:51.043 --> 06:54.479
The Burundi government has
approved a limited expedition.

06:54.547 --> 06:56.947
So I want you to go in light,
stake out his swamp,

06:57.016 --> 06:59.917
and bag this crocodile
in time for sweeps.

06:59.986 --> 07:03.945
Network News Channel will finance the
hunt in exchange for exclusive rights.

07:04.023 --> 07:06.548
- Rog, Burundi's a war zone.
- You'll be fine.

07:06.626 --> 07:08.423
For the moment
there's a ceasefire.

07:08.494 --> 07:12.021
My contact assured me as long as
you keep out of local politics,

07:12.098 --> 07:13.759
he can guarantee your safety.

07:13.833 --> 07:15.892
We'll have to pick up
a local guide,

07:15.968 --> 07:18.903
but, beyond that, I'm thinking
we just take a skeleton crew,

07:18.971 --> 07:20.461
you, me, and a cameraman.

07:20.540 --> 07:23.065
No offense, but this ain't
my sort of thing.

- Aviva.

Could you give us a minute?

07:32.251 --> 07:35.220

- You too.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.200

07:53.272 --> 07:55.968
And you wanna show the world

08:02.648 --> 08:03.910

That's where we're gonna be.
It's gorgeous.

08:54.066 --> 08:56.000
It is if you're
high enough above it.

08:56.068 --> 08:58.662
Burundi's the poorest country

08:58.738 --> 09:01.605
The last 40 years, a civil war
between the Hutu and Tutsi,

09:01.674 --> 09:04.802

Roger's tapping that ass?

She got a nice ass.
He has the tappin' apparatus.

09:29.835 --> 09:31.826
I think he is.

You have rooms at the hotel.
You are already checked in.

10:53.419 --> 10:57.412
We need to meet a guide.
We have to leave immediately.

10:57.490 --> 11:00.288
This is Africa, my brother.
Nothing happens immediately.

11:00.359 --> 11:02.350
Besides, your transport was required

11:02.428 --> 11:04.157
for a brief military operation

11:04.230 --> 11:05.993
and not all of the fuel
was delivered.

- That's hard to say, ma'am.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.696
But the accommodations
are most comfortable.

11:10.770 --> 11:13.261
Rog, your pal says we gotta
wait around indefinitely.

11:13.339 --> 11:16.137
I mean, why should you hold up
your end of the deal?

11:16.208 --> 11:18.335
- He's not legit.
- Sir, you misunderstand me.

11:18.411 --> 11:20.311
It's just a matter of time...

11:20.379 --> 11:22.313
We can hook up
with Roberts in the Sudan.

11:22.381 --> 11:24.440
- By the end of the week.
- Or... we pull out.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.315
- Tomorrow.
- Hold on, Roger.

11:28.320 --> 11:31.289

[Aviva] Nice.

This croc is big, really big,
maybe up to nine meters.

12:02.722 --> 12:06.385
- 25, even 30 feet.
- Nine meters? One fat bastard.

12:06.459 --> 12:08.950
They'll grow indefinitely
depending on food intake.

12:09.028 --> 12:10.518
And they can live over 100 years.

12:10.596 --> 12:12.120
- Like dinosaurs.
- Older.

12:12.198 --> 12:15.167
They haven't changed much since
the Triassic. Why should they?

12:15.234 --> 12:17.998
They're the most efficient
killing machines on the planet.

12:18.070 --> 12:20.504
- Apart from Homo sapiens.
- What are these marks?

12:20.573 --> 12:22.473
Scar tissue.
He's been shot many times.

12:22.541 --> 12:26.238
Gustave.
Motherfucker's bulletproof?

12:26.312 --> 12:30.510
- Gustave. He take my cousin.
- Are you sure it was him?

12:30.583 --> 12:32.551
Everybody knows this Gustave.

12:32.618 --> 12:35.246
He killed hundreds.

Hundreds? Yeah, right, man.

12:38.290 --> 12:40.349
- [Aviva] It'd make the news.
- Why would it?

Thousands have died here.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.392

- What...?

12:44.463 --> 12:46.488
This crocodile's like O.J. Simpson.

12:46.565 --> 12:48.624
He messed up
when he killed that white woman.

12:48.701 --> 12:52.762
Which, let's face it, is the
only reason you people are here.

12:52.838 --> 12:56.103
For you, this monster
is entertainment.

12:56.175 --> 12:59.440
- But here we know better.
- Do we really need that?

12:59.512 --> 13:01.480
You can never be
too careful, ma'am.

13:01.547 --> 13:04.539
You'll travel through territory
controlled by Little Gustave.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.108
- Little Gustave?
- He rules the Upper Rusizi.

13:07.186 --> 13:08.813
Got his name from the crocodile.

13:08.888 --> 13:10.822
It's hard to say

But don't worry, these guys will

Nice chatting with you.

14:49.688 --> 14:51.815
Are you working on my lead-ins?

14:51.891 --> 14:54.621
No. Working on the real story,
the HMO scandal.

14:54.693 --> 14:56.251
You wouldn't believe the shit...

14:56.328 --> 15:00.560
Right, right.
This isn't a real story.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.928
Well... let's face it,
catching a killer croc,

15:06.005 --> 15:09.099
it ain't the makings
of a Pulitzer Prize.

15:09.174 --> 15:11.438
Like the Porter story you just blew?

15:12.544 --> 15:15.707
Question your assumptions, Tim.

15:15.781 --> 15:18.716
Isn't that the first thing
they teach you?

15:18.784 --> 15:21.378
Where did you learn that,
modeling school?

15:21.453 --> 15:24.479
No, Columbia School
of Journalism.

15:24.556 --> 15:27.957
You are such an asshole,
aren't you?

15:29.428 --> 15:30.656
Well...

15:35.100 --> 15:36.294
[shouting]

15:55.554 --> 15:58.682
- What the hell's going on?
- Some guys were shooting at us.

16:13.372 --> 16:16.899
Who are those guys?
I thought there was a ceasefire.

16:16.976 --> 16:20.070
This is a war zone.
People shoot at each other.

Roger sends his regards...

18:02.247 --> 18:05.341
I received word this morning
there has been another attack.

18:05.417 --> 18:09.012
A little girl was killed
in a village 30km north.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.522
- Say we get moving.
- The rapids are too rough.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.956
We'll have to drive.

18:14.026 --> 18:17.792
Problem is, the village is close
to Little Gustave's territory.

18:17.863 --> 18:19.228
- The warlord?
- Uh-huh.

18:19.298 --> 18:22.392
We'll go see him, explain
we're a scientific expedition

18:22.468 --> 18:24.595
with no interest in politics.

18:24.670 --> 18:28.606
Nobody sees Little Gustave.
Except those he means to kill.

18:28.674 --> 18:31.507
- So, what do we do?
- We take our chances.

18:31.577 --> 18:33.977
We leave first thing
in the morning.

19:00.939 --> 19:03.669
Are you looking for something?

19:03.742 --> 19:06.905
- You're a poacher.
- No, I'm a licensed hunter.

19:06.979 --> 19:10.073
I started this expedition to save
Gustave from people like you.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.310
It's a wonder
there are any crocs left.

19:12.384 --> 19:14.682
You may be grateful
for my skills.

19:14.753 --> 19:16.812
We're after a man-eater.

19:16.889 --> 19:20.256
There are more than enough
human beings on this planet.

19:20.325 --> 19:23.294
The crocodile is exceptional,

19:23.362 --> 19:26.229
a creature of far greater value.

19:26.298 --> 19:28.664
You don't seem stupid,
so you must be insane.

19:28.734 --> 19:31.362
This croc cannot be taken alive.

19:33.739 --> 19:35.730
I'll call the whole thing off.

19:35.807 --> 19:38.708
I'll pack up my gear
and send the Americans home

19:38.777 --> 19:41.109
before I allow you
to harm this animal.

19:42.247 --> 19:44.238
Do you understand me?

19:45.851 --> 19:49.184
Sir, I'm only your humble guide.

19:57.362 --> 20:00.695
Not even Gustave can bite
through this reinforced steel.

20:00.766 --> 20:03.633
Once inside, his weight
will activate a pressure plate,

20:03.702 --> 20:05.966
triggering a spring-Ioaded door.

20:06.038 --> 20:09.474
Dr. Collins has designed this
trap so that no harm can come

20:09.541 --> 20:11.532
to this extraordinary creature...

20:29.728 --> 20:32.026
- Cut! Cut.
- What?

20:32.097 --> 20:34.031
Still a little chipper.

20:34.099 --> 20:36.829
Oh! You know, this is
starting to get abusive.

20:36.902 --> 20:40.065
Dial it down. We're not shooting
a toothpaste commercial.

20:40.138 --> 20:42.231
Not all of us can be
clinically depressed.

20:42.307 --> 20:44.207
Oh, shit! There's Gustave!

20:44.276 --> 20:47.143
Oh, shit! Shit!

20:47.212 --> 20:48.907
I got it right here!

20:48.981 --> 20:51.245
- Funny, man.
- Let's do it again.

20:51.316 --> 20:54.149
I got both of y'all, too.
Aviva, it's Gustave!

20:54.219 --> 20:57.211
It's Gu...
He's waving at you!

[African music]

21:59.951 --> 22:02.681
These people! It's unbelievable.

22:02.754 --> 22:05.518
Already back in the river
like nothing's happened.

22:05.590 --> 22:08.457
The river's their source of food,
their only water.

22:08.527 --> 22:10.859
- Their life.
- Life is right.

22:10.929 --> 22:15.229
Y'all ever seen <i>Jaws,</i> the movie?
Might wanna check that out.

22:18.003 --> 22:19.595
That to warn the villagers?

22:19.671 --> 22:22.834
They kept him tied out there
as an offering to the croc.

22:22.908 --> 22:25.240
That's not terribly effective.

22:25.310 --> 22:28.643
I'm all for tradition,
but I can't leave him like that.

22:30.749 --> 22:33.479
That is one ugly-ass dog.

22:39.624 --> 22:44.493
- [Dog barks]
- Oh, look at you.

22:44.563 --> 22:47.088
Oh.

22:47.165 --> 22:51.033
Hi, little guy.

22:54.072 --> 22:55.903
Don't be scared.
Don't be scared.

[African music]

23:04.082 --> 23:06.482
[Krieg] There's a shaman
who lives near here.

23:06.551 --> 23:08.143
We'll have to ask
for his blessing

23:08.220 --> 23:10.381
if we want the villagers
to help us.

23:10.455 --> 23:14.516
Tonight the feast
is for gratitude, luck.

23:14.593 --> 23:16.424
This is delicious.
What is this?

23:17.696 --> 23:19.891
<i>Nyama ni nyama tu,</i> in Swahili.

23:19.965 --> 23:22.331
It means "all meat is meat".

23:22.401 --> 23:23.800
In other words, don't ask.

23:26.004 --> 23:27.130
[Music ends]

23:27.205 --> 23:28.729

23:34.780 --> 23:38.580

- For what?

23:38.650 --> 23:41.881
To perform
one of your native songs.

23:45.023 --> 23:48.481
No, no. We no sing. Drink.

23:49.528 --> 23:51.928
- [Tim] Eat.
- And eat.

24:00.405 --> 24:02.737
They're staring.

24:11.516 --> 24:15.350
<i># How sweet the sound...</i>

24:15.420 --> 24:17.854
Why did you go and pick
a Negro spiritual?

24:17.923 --> 24:20.391

- In Africa?

24:20.459 --> 24:25.692
<i># A wretch like me</i>

24:25.764 --> 24:29.131
This is it. I can't believe
you're gonna make me do this.

- <i>#... was lost</i>
- Good, huh?

24:31.670 --> 24:35.902
- <i># But now I'm found</i>
- Yeah.

24:35.974 --> 24:38.306
- <i># I was blind...</i>
- You know what?

24:38.376 --> 24:42.278
Let's just remix.
Can you give me a beat?

24:42.347 --> 24:44.838
A one, two, three. Go.

24:53.758 --> 24:55.749

25:30.095 --> 25:33.428
Gwanyana is one of
the village elders,

25:33.498 --> 25:36.729
a sort of priest shaman.

25:36.801 --> 25:40.259
He is performing a rite
for the soul of the little girl.

25:45.277 --> 25:47.370
He says Kirunga came again.

25:47.445 --> 25:50.243
Kirunga is like a bad spirit.

25:50.315 --> 25:55.218
Evil men call to him,
men like Little Gustave.

25:55.287 --> 25:59.348
The good people are weak.
They are the ones who suffer.

25:59.424 --> 26:02.985
They live in fear.
Kirunga surrounds them.

26:03.061 --> 26:05.529
Little Gustave rules the land.

26:05.597 --> 26:08.191
The crocodile rules the water.

[Breathing heavily]

Hey!

Hey! Hey!

26:22.781 --> 26:24.976
Hey. Naughty By Nature, right?

26:28.420 --> 26:32.015
This is some good shit. Yeah.
I'll have a nickel bag of that.

26:32.090 --> 26:33.853
- It's meant to be a blessing.
- It is.

26:33.925 --> 26:38.021
One more hit? One more hit?
No? OK.

26:38.096 --> 26:40.894

If you'll excuse me.

Hey!

26:56.348 --> 26:57.781
What's he saying?

26:57.849 --> 27:00.409
He says that
we'll find what we seek.

27:02.988 --> 27:06.321
Then we'll find death.

27:12.697 --> 27:16.861
You, me, all,

27:16.935 --> 27:18.459
we make Kirunga.

27:31.750 --> 27:33.877
[Krieg] I think I know
where Gustave might be.

27:33.952 --> 27:36.250
Recent attacks are focused
around a small island

27:36.321 --> 27:39.950
in Kibira Wetlands, a swamp
a few miles to the northeast.

27:40.025 --> 27:42.186
We need a lot of hands,
a lot of help.

27:42.260 --> 27:44.820
Half of you on this side
and half on the other side.

27:44.896 --> 27:48.229
Why carry the cage?
Let's take this road.

27:48.299 --> 27:51.132
Suicide. The shaman says
it's under the control

27:51.202 --> 27:52.863
- of Hutu militia.
- Little Gustave?

27:52.937 --> 27:54.734
The shaman has been
a thorn in his side,

27:54.806 --> 27:57.900
trying to get the village
to stand up to the warlords.

27:57.976 --> 28:00.706
Isn't that why we have
these guys, to protect us?

28:00.779 --> 28:03.907
They can't stop a landmine.
Plus, the militia carry rockets.

28:03.982 --> 28:06.416
Most of them are teenagers,
high on amphetamines.

28:06.484 --> 28:08.679
They'd kill you
for that watch you're wearing.

28:08.753 --> 28:13.713
Come on, lift! We need
more people on the side here.

28:13.792 --> 28:15.817

- Hey, what are you doing?

water, leading to the cage.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.791
Never had much luck with croc bait.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.588
You'll see, from two kilometers,

31:02.660 --> 31:05.094
Gustave will come running
with a hard-on.

31:07.966 --> 31:11.333
Tranquilizer darts won't work.
They can't penetrate his scales.

31:11.402 --> 31:12.994
I'd never use tranqs.

31:13.071 --> 31:16.268
Too much danger of overdosing
and drowning the animal.

I'd never say this in front
of a bunch of white people,

Civil war, genocide, all those bodies
floating in the water.

for human flesh.

This boy is shot.

We can't find our cameraman.

What? We need to find Steven
and get Jojo to a doctor.

1:15:15.511 --> 1:15:18.480
It will be best to recover
your equipment now.

1:15:18.547 --> 1:15:20.708
Anything of value
does tend to disappear.

1:15:20.782 --> 1:15:24.479
[Aviva] I don't care about the
tape anymore. It doesn't matter.

1:15:24.553 --> 1:15:26.851
I just wanna find Steven.

1:15:32.027 --> 1:15:35.155
You are a very perceptive man,
Mr. Manfrey.

1:15:35.230 --> 1:15:38.996
It's best if we are honest
with one another.

- What do you mean?
- [Speaks Swahili]

1:15:43.071 --> 1:15:46.472
I was photographed
in a rather compromising position.

1:15:46.542 --> 1:15:47.873
Where is the computer?

1:15:47.943 --> 1:15:50.070
He works for Little Gustave too.

1:15:50.145 --> 1:15:52.443

1:15:52.514 --> 1:15:55.108
So many of us here
lead double lives.

I'm just another functionary,

1:16:00.756 --> 1:16:02.383
He is little Gustave.

1:16:02.457 --> 1:16:04.448
Very few people are aware of that.

1:16:07.663 --> 1:16:11.155
We lost the laptop. Besides,
you weren't even recognizable.

can never stop worrying.

we have to get Jojo to a hospital.

1:16:19.908 --> 1:16:22.376
Isn't that tragic?

1:16:22.444 --> 1:16:25.777

die every day here in Africa.

- Why would we tell you, Harry?
