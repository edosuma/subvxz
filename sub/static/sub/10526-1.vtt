WEBVTT

00:12.012 --> 00:14.145
[eagle screeches]

00:55.556 --> 00:59.730
[man] Alex Russo, you kneel
before the Crystals of Justice

00:59.730 --> 01:02.663
where you are charged
with treason for attempting

01:02.663 --> 01:05.336
to destroy the mortal world.

01:05.336 --> 01:07.468
I'm telling you,

01:07.468 --> 01:09.670
- you have the wrong wizard.
- Silence!

01:09.670 --> 01:12.443
OK, I am right here.
You do not have to yell.

01:13.744 --> 01:16.777
What I was trying
to say is that, OK,

01:16.777 --> 01:19.610
maybe some bad things
happened,

01:19.610 --> 01:22.213
and maybe it was
because of me,

01:22.213 --> 01:25.116
but that doesn't mean
it was my fault.

01:25.116 --> 01:26.657
I'd make a terrible lawyer.

01:26.657 --> 01:28.589
[woman] Your fate
has been decided.

01:28.589 --> 01:31.692
The Crystal Cavern of Justice
hereby find you guilty!

01:31.692 --> 01:35.166
Wait! No! Isn't there some way
we can replay what happened

01:35.166 --> 01:37.168
so you would know
I'm innocent?

01:37.168 --> 01:38.569
Well, almost innocent.

01:38.569 --> 01:41.532
[man 2] You're not speaking
of the Time Vortex, are you?

01:41.532 --> 01:45.105
Well, if that's what you call
a rewind button, then yeah.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.106
[man] Very well.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.278
We will send you back

01:47.278 --> 01:49.210
to the moment
this incident began.

01:49.210 --> 01:51.642
All right. Well, get your
popcorn and licorice

01:51.642 --> 01:54.685
because you're going to like
how this got started.

02:02.793 --> 02:04.155
[horror film music]

02:04.155 --> 02:07.198
- [woman screaming]
- [laughs]

02:07.198 --> 02:08.699
I just love drive-in movies.

02:08.699 --> 02:10.830
You can yell at the screen
and nobody cares.

02:10.830 --> 02:12.733
[yells] Hey, genius,
the walls are oozing maggots!

02:12.733 --> 02:14.665
Why are you taking a shower?

02:16.267 --> 02:18.609
Alex...

02:21.772 --> 02:23.674
Your own
personal drive-in?!

02:23.674 --> 02:25.376
Get rid of it now.

02:25.376 --> 02:27.578
Come on, Dad.
I can get you your own car

02:27.578 --> 02:28.879
and you can
watch the movie with us.

02:28.879 --> 02:30.351
I can get you a churro truck.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.425
Lose it.

02:34.425 --> 02:35.656
Fine.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.259
And whose car was that?

02:38.259 --> 02:40.291
I don't know, but there's
some guy out on Waverly Place

02:40.291 --> 02:41.892
who's been looking for his car
for about an hour.

02:41.892 --> 02:43.664
- Show me some love, Harper.
- Yeah.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.296
Harper, don't high-five her.

02:45.296 --> 02:47.638
What she did was wrong
and unbelievably selfish.

02:47.638 --> 02:49.800
Well, we left the guy
half a pack of licorice.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.342
No, we didn't.

02:52.543 --> 02:55.175
Dad, what's the big deal? I've
always done stuff like this.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.608
Right, but now that you're
the family wizard,

02:57.608 --> 03:01.552
it's time to stop
using magic for selfish reasons.

03:01.552 --> 03:02.683
Now give me that popcorn.

03:04.615 --> 03:06.957
Thank you so much, Mason.

03:06.957 --> 03:08.859
OK, you and Alex
can hang up the banner.

03:08.859 --> 03:11.522
Harper, get the ice cream cake
out of the freezer.

03:11.522 --> 03:13.564
Jerry, stop eating
popcorn off the floor.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.697
Wait, did you say party?
For who?

03:18.729 --> 03:20.671
I have a fair inkling.

03:20.671 --> 03:23.534
Another party for Justin?!

03:23.534 --> 03:26.707
We're just so excited about
him taking over WizTech.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.709
[giggles]
It's a big deal.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.681
Yeah. I guess you're right.

03:30.681 --> 03:32.643
It's not like, you know,
actually winning

03:32.643 --> 03:35.646
the family competition
and becoming the full wizard.

03:35.646 --> 03:37.648
Since nobody
ever threw me a party.

03:37.648 --> 03:40.551
Hey, I didn't get a party
or get to become a wizard.

03:40.551 --> 03:43.654
I just got these all-you-can-eat
bologna scraps.

03:45.596 --> 03:47.758
Mmmm. Maybe I am the winner.

03:47.758 --> 03:51.462
Come on, everybody.
We've got a lot of work to do.

03:51.462 --> 03:52.633
Justin's going to be here soon.

03:57.308 --> 03:59.370
All right, I'm done.
Where's my magazine?

03:59.370 --> 04:01.872
Mason, rub my shoulders.
That was hard work.

04:01.872 --> 04:04.675
Hey! I just told you,

04:04.675 --> 04:06.747
magic is not
for getting what you want

04:06.747 --> 04:08.319
or using it
for selfish reasons.

04:08.319 --> 04:09.880
Mason, stop rubbing
her shoulders!

04:09.880 --> 04:12.823
That's right, mija.
You should use your magic

04:12.823 --> 04:14.725
to make other people's
lives easier.

04:14.725 --> 04:16.726
I know a pretty Latina
who would love

04:16.726 --> 04:18.689
to never have to do
laundry again.

04:19.690 --> 04:20.731
Theresa.

04:20.731 --> 04:23.794
Sorry. Your father's right.
It's time to grow up.

04:23.794 --> 04:27.398
"Grow up?" Everybody
knows people who grow up

04:27.398 --> 04:29.700
too fast are miserable.
I mean, look at Harper.

04:29.700 --> 04:31.542
She's been doing
her parents' laundry

04:31.542 --> 04:32.703
since she was
in the second grade.

04:32.703 --> 04:35.746
Oh, see, the laundry
I didn't mind so much.

04:35.746 --> 04:37.608
It was rotating the tires
on the minivan that just...

04:37.608 --> 04:39.650
[blows raspberry]
...really got to me.

04:44.355 --> 04:46.717
Where's Justin?
He should've been here by now.

04:46.717 --> 04:47.718
You mean he's not here?

04:47.718 --> 04:49.390
I'm so bored I thought
he was here

04:49.390 --> 04:50.921
telling one of his nerdy stories

04:50.921 --> 04:53.324
that always ends with
"Hey, wake up, everybody!"

04:56.967 --> 05:00.501
I'm so sorry for the intrusion.
I'm Justin's friend Dominic.

05:00.501 --> 05:01.972
He asked me
to give you a message.

05:01.972 --> 05:05.606
He is too busy at WizTech
and unfortunately cannot come.

05:05.606 --> 05:06.937
OK. Give us the message.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.881
Uh... that was the message.

05:10.881 --> 05:12.343
OK. Can we start from the top?

05:12.343 --> 05:13.614
Because this guy
is all over the place.

05:14.615 --> 05:16.517
So is Justin all right?

05:16.517 --> 05:18.919
Oh, yes, Mrs. Russo.
Justin is fine.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.621
It's just more difficult
for someone

05:20.621 --> 05:22.693
with his spectacular talents
to get away.

05:22.693 --> 05:24.825
Now, I don't usually use
the word "spectacular,"

05:24.825 --> 05:27.598
but in Justin's case,
spectacular.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.431
Justin isn't coming?

05:30.431 --> 05:32.062
What are we gonna do
with the ice cream cake.

05:32.062 --> 05:34.435
Oh, I'm sure you'll
think of something, Jerry.

05:35.766 --> 05:38.939
Excuse me,
you must be Alex Russo.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.741
You're quite famous
in the wizard world

05:40.741 --> 05:44.675
but I had no
idea you were so... beautiful.

05:44.675 --> 05:47.478
Oh, come on.
I'm not that famous.

05:47.478 --> 05:51.882
Dominic. Nice to meet you, mate.
I'm Mason Greyback.

05:51.882 --> 05:54.955
Perhaps you've heard of me,
Alex's werewolf boyfriend.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.988
Boyfriend? You're a lucky man.

05:57.988 --> 06:01.592
Yes, I am. A lucky werewolf.

06:01.592 --> 06:02.593
[growls]

06:04.595 --> 06:08.639
Well, it seems like I've made
this awkward, forgive me.

06:08.639 --> 06:09.700
It was an honor meeting you,
Alex.

06:09.700 --> 06:11.842
So long, everyone.

06:11.842 --> 06:13.003
Werewolf.

06:16.977 --> 06:20.711
Boy, he was the most
polite wizard I have ever met.

06:20.711 --> 06:22.753
And easy on the eyes.

06:22.753 --> 06:25.416
Reminded me of a young me.

06:26.717 --> 06:28.959
You know, I think
he was into you, Alex.

06:28.959 --> 06:30.721
Oh. No, no, no, no.

06:30.721 --> 06:33.724
Yeah. No, no, no, no.

06:33.724 --> 06:35.566
I can't believe Justin's
not coming.

06:35.566 --> 06:37.828
I wanted him to be here
for my big announcement.

06:37.828 --> 06:41.532
A while ago, I got an invitation
from my cousin, Carmela,

06:41.532 --> 06:45.436
in Italy, inviting us
to a Russo family reunion.

06:45.436 --> 06:46.737
It's OK, Dad.
What's your announcement?

06:47.738 --> 06:48.879
That was the announcement.

06:48.879 --> 06:51.682
Oh, great, now Dad's
all over the place.

06:51.682 --> 06:54.785
Aww, Jerry, you're taking me
on a romantic trip to Italy,

06:54.785 --> 06:56.146
- I love you.
- Well...

06:56.146 --> 06:58.649
Actually, I'm taking
the whole family.

06:58.649 --> 07:00.891
Why? They don't know
we have kids.

07:02.453 --> 07:04.725
But, Theresa,
it's a family reunion.

07:04.725 --> 07:08.629
Or should I say
[accent] riunione di famiglia?

07:08.629 --> 07:10.631
Please don't do that, Dad.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.633
It's almost as annoying
as when you say

07:12.633 --> 07:14.565
[bad accent]
"mootsa-rella."

07:14.565 --> 07:17.668
Well, you guys have fun.

07:17.668 --> 07:21.071
I'll just stay here
and read or something.

07:21.071 --> 07:24.745
Yeah, and I'll just stay here
and chew up the furniture.

07:24.745 --> 07:26.747
This couch looks
pretty fruity.

07:28.819 --> 07:30.050
You guys are family, too.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.623
I got tickets for all
of us to go.

07:32.623 --> 07:34.655
- [gasps]
- All right!

07:34.655 --> 07:36.627
Tickets? Dad, if you want
to go to Italy,

07:36.627 --> 07:38.058
I can be our travel agent.

07:38.058 --> 07:40.030
No time for that
travel confusion.

07:40.030 --> 07:42.032
Show me the door to
our Italian reunion.

07:48.739 --> 07:51.602
OK, I don't know how to say
"Wizard Speed Pass" in Italian,

07:51.602 --> 07:54.104
so I'm just going to go with
"Mamma Mia!"

07:54.104 --> 07:55.676
Or at least I think
that's Italian.

07:59.079 --> 08:02.613
[Max] A door to Japan? How cool.

08:03.914 --> 08:06.657
It's Italy.

08:06.657 --> 08:08.759
I don't know all the towns
in Japan, dude.

08:09.820 --> 08:11.892
Alex, you're not going to
turn this trip

08:11.892 --> 08:13.924
into one of your
selfish shortcuts.

08:13.924 --> 08:16.767
I want us to experience
the whole journey.

08:16.767 --> 08:18.669
Getting there is half the fun.

08:18.669 --> 08:21.101
Now, get rid of this thing.

08:24.735 --> 08:27.137
Whoa.

08:27.137 --> 08:29.079
Did you just see that girl?

08:29.079 --> 08:30.711
Alex, I have to get
her number first.

08:30.711 --> 08:33.614
Max, get back here!

08:33.614 --> 08:35.515
Would you please grow up?!

08:35.515 --> 08:36.717
Max!

08:41.020 --> 08:44.655
OK, let's just find Max
and go home.

08:44.655 --> 08:45.856
So we can fly back here.

08:47.658 --> 08:51.261
Wow! Look at this place.

08:51.261 --> 08:54.164
Oh. It's beautiful.

09:00.170 --> 09:02.813
Your family lives here?

09:02.813 --> 09:05.275
Villa di Russo.

09:05.275 --> 09:09.049
I don't know who "Villa di" is,
but Russo is definitely me.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.982
I don't think
he's mad at you anymore.

09:11.982 --> 09:15.886
Oh, don't be fooled. He's happy
anywhere there's cheese hanging.

09:17.788 --> 09:18.959
Man. I lost her.

09:18.959 --> 09:21.592
I didn't even get her name,
but she looked like a Tomiko.

09:22.893 --> 09:25.636
Tomiko! Tomiko!

09:25.636 --> 09:29.740
Max. Forget the girl.
We've got girls back home.

09:29.740 --> 09:31.602
Yeah, but there's
no Italians in New York, Mom.

09:32.743 --> 09:35.045
Oh, come on. Can't we
stay a little longer?

09:35.045 --> 09:36.677
This is the first time
Alex's magic

09:36.677 --> 09:38.048
took me somewhere
that didn't scared me.

09:38.048 --> 09:41.151
No. We're not coming
to Italy this way.

09:41.151 --> 09:44.084
We're going to experience
a family trip the real way.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.617
You mean on a discount flight
in cramped seats

09:46.617 --> 09:47.988
with bad food
and an obnoxious kid

09:47.988 --> 09:50.120
in front of you saying,
"peek-a-boo, peek-a-boo."

09:52.693 --> 09:53.694
Ciao, bella.

09:55.626 --> 09:58.298
Are you here for a tour
of the Russo vineyard?

09:58.298 --> 10:01.131
Well... I, uh...

10:01.131 --> 10:03.303
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

10:03.303 --> 10:05.375
We're not
here for the tour, paisan.

10:05.375 --> 10:06.376
Go back to work.

10:07.678 --> 10:09.609
And put a shirt on!

10:09.609 --> 10:10.811
All right, let's go.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.943
OK, fine. But you'll only have
yourself to blame

10:12.943 --> 10:15.646
when that peek-a-boo kid
uses your lap for a barf bag.

10:18.719 --> 10:22.693
All right, is everybody here?

10:22.693 --> 10:24.695
Good. Now, Alex,

10:24.695 --> 10:26.396
- get rid of this thing.
- OK.

10:28.628 --> 10:32.863
Hmm... The spell I need
is like things in my bedroom.

10:32.863 --> 10:35.966
It's buried under the dirty
clothes of my mind.

10:35.966 --> 10:38.208
You see? Justin would
never do a spell

10:38.208 --> 10:39.940
that he didn't know
how to undo.

10:41.171 --> 10:42.743
Oh, I get it.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.675
I get this whole
"grown-up" thing now.

10:44.675 --> 10:46.717
You think Justin should've been
the family wizard.

10:46.717 --> 10:49.419
Honey, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it that way.

10:49.419 --> 10:51.952
No. I'm sorry I'm not the
grown-up family wizard

10:51.952 --> 10:53.053
you want me to be.

10:55.125 --> 10:57.057
Well, up until then,

10:57.057 --> 10:58.959
that was the best five-minute
vacation I've ever had.

11:16.907 --> 11:18.148
[clears throat]

11:18.148 --> 11:20.851
Excuse me,
is this Jumbotron taken?

11:20.851 --> 11:23.383
Dominic?
What are you doing here?

11:23.383 --> 11:26.186
My night job is cleaning
the back of the Jumbotron.

11:27.457 --> 11:29.159
You being here
is just a bonus.

11:29.159 --> 11:33.063
Look, you seem really nice,
but I have a boyfriend.

11:33.063 --> 11:34.725
And to be honest

11:34.725 --> 11:36.396
I don't think I'd be really
good company right now.

11:36.396 --> 11:40.000
Unless you're a fan of big,
sloppy emotional meltdowns.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.371
You know, I was just saying
this morning,

11:41.371 --> 11:43.934
I haven't seen a big,
sloppy emotional meltdown

11:43.934 --> 11:46.807
in a while.
Let's see what you got.

11:48.779 --> 11:50.881
Ah, a smile.

11:52.442 --> 11:54.885
Have you ever considered
joining the Wizard Council?

11:54.885 --> 11:56.817
The Wizard Council?

11:56.817 --> 11:58.919
Isn't that for old geezers
who wear robes

11:58.919 --> 12:00.350
because they're
tired of shopping?

12:00.350 --> 12:01.792
[laughs]

12:01.792 --> 12:03.393
I just believe
you have the potential

12:03.393 --> 12:07.457
to be the most powerful wizard
of your generation.

12:07.457 --> 12:10.730
Trust me. You have no idea
what you're truly capable of.

12:12.132 --> 12:14.364
Well, if you ask my family,

12:14.364 --> 12:18.408
I'm not capable of anything
except refusing to grow up.

12:18.408 --> 12:20.040
They're mortals.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.072
They can't understand
wizards with your power.

12:22.072 --> 12:24.875
Besides, if their opinions
really bothers you,

12:24.875 --> 12:27.077
you're powerful enough
to create your own spell

12:27.077 --> 12:29.749
to smooth out
your little edges.

12:31.782 --> 12:33.383
Why are you telling me this?

12:33.383 --> 12:37.828
Because where everyone else
sees trouble,

12:37.828 --> 12:39.189
I see magic.

12:40.891 --> 12:42.192
And beauty.

12:43.433 --> 12:46.837
OK, now you're just flirting.

12:46.837 --> 12:48.338
Yeah, a little bit.

12:48.338 --> 12:50.470
Here. It's a small gift.

12:50.470 --> 12:51.872
Oh, no.
I can't take that.

12:51.872 --> 12:53.403
It's simply
a friendship bracelet.

12:58.378 --> 13:00.110
Everything OK up here?

13:00.110 --> 13:02.782
Oh, yeah. Mason, sorry.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.254
I just had to get away
from home, you know.

13:04.254 --> 13:06.256
And I just came
to check on her.

13:06.256 --> 13:07.858
I apologize
if I've overstepped.

13:07.858 --> 13:10.961
You have, mate,
and I'm here now.

13:10.961 --> 13:12.262
Werewolf.

13:13.824 --> 13:14.865
Good-bye, Alex.

13:14.865 --> 13:16.496
Bye.

13:16.496 --> 13:18.228
Werewolf.

13:22.132 --> 13:25.035
I do not like that guy.

13:25.035 --> 13:27.107
Anything I should be
worried about?

13:27.107 --> 13:28.438
Not a thing.

13:28.438 --> 13:31.541
Good. Well, I've got a surprise
to cheer you up.

13:31.541 --> 13:33.113
I thought we would have
a little picnic.

13:33.113 --> 13:37.817
Don't say Italian, 'cause I've
had enough of that, today.

13:37.817 --> 13:42.822
No. I was thinking
something sophisticated...

13:43.854 --> 13:44.895
...poached salmon.

13:44.895 --> 13:48.458
Oh, Mason.
That's so sweet.

13:48.458 --> 13:50.600
But can I make a little tweak?

13:50.600 --> 13:52.832
Of course, darling.

13:55.605 --> 13:58.608
Check it out, finger food
feast. I call the wing.

13:58.608 --> 14:01.511
No, Alex! Alex, you know
this food is bad for you.

14:01.511 --> 14:03.213
Besides,
I cooked that salmon,

14:03.213 --> 14:05.275
two hours
over a hot poacher.

14:05.275 --> 14:08.578
Why? You know it only
takes me like two seconds.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.923
I see. So, this is how
it's going to be from now on.

14:12.923 --> 14:14.584
What?

14:14.584 --> 14:18.228
Just you, me and your wand.

14:18.228 --> 14:21.391
Just using your magic selfishly
no matter who it hurts.

14:22.993 --> 14:26.596
Mason, where are you going?
I did all this for us.

14:26.596 --> 14:28.568
So did I.

14:38.248 --> 14:40.550
So you turned Mason's
classy picnic

14:40.550 --> 14:42.452
into a county fair fry-fest?

14:42.452 --> 14:45.055
Well, everybody knows
that my favorite food

14:45.055 --> 14:46.656
comes in
cardboard containers

14:46.656 --> 14:48.558
with some kind
of dipping sauce.

14:48.558 --> 14:50.220
Ew.

14:50.220 --> 14:55.425
Oh, Hi, Alex. Can you tell me
what's wrong with this picture?

14:57.167 --> 14:59.299
Everything you're wearing
is from the nineties.

14:59.299 --> 15:00.430
[laughing]

15:00.430 --> 15:03.633
Oh, but if you guys wear it,
it's "vintage."

15:03.633 --> 15:06.206
Have you figured out how
to get rid of this thing yet?

15:06.206 --> 15:08.478
Uh, no.
I've been a little busy.

15:08.478 --> 15:10.941
But don't worry,
I'll figure it out something

15:10.941 --> 15:12.442
before Max can use it again.

15:12.442 --> 15:13.944
[door opens]

15:13.944 --> 15:17.517
Hey, who wants to help me
make a hot tub out of this?

15:19.489 --> 15:22.492
I bet I know how he's going
to make the bubbles.

15:22.492 --> 15:26.326
Max, stop going to Italy.
And, Alex, you...

15:26.326 --> 15:28.498
I know, I know. Grow up.

15:28.498 --> 15:31.601
You're right, Pop.
I'll just take this back.

15:31.601 --> 15:34.434
Max, you forgot the barrel!

15:34.434 --> 15:35.565
Max!

15:35.565 --> 15:39.339
He's not coming back, is he?

15:39.339 --> 15:42.212
Theresa, we have to
find Max again!

15:42.212 --> 15:45.515
What?!
I was about to make dinner.

15:45.515 --> 15:47.947
It's just Italy,
we'll be right back.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.089
Hey, are you OK?

16:00.590 --> 16:03.994
It's just that, I thought once
I became the family wizard,

16:03.994 --> 16:07.067
all of this pressure
would be off of me.

16:07.067 --> 16:11.101
But no, it's like everybody
still wants me to change.

16:11.101 --> 16:13.403
Well, that doesn't make
a lot of sense.

16:13.403 --> 16:14.644
It's who you are
in the first place

16:14.644 --> 16:16.076
that made you
the family wizard

16:16.076 --> 16:19.579
I know,
but maybe growing up

16:19.579 --> 16:22.382
would make me
a better person.

16:22.382 --> 16:24.284
I mean, I can't even say
anything nice

16:24.284 --> 16:26.586
about my best friend's
hideous clambake outfit.

16:26.586 --> 16:29.619
I'm sorry, Harper.
I held off as long as I could.

16:29.619 --> 16:31.191
But you see?
That's what I mean.

16:31.191 --> 16:33.063
You making fun
of my outfit is you.

16:33.063 --> 16:35.365
And me loving
this outfit is me.

16:35.365 --> 16:37.597
People should appreciate you
for who you are,

16:37.597 --> 16:39.099
not for what
they think you should be.

16:41.271 --> 16:44.734
Right. And I am
a powerful wizard

16:44.734 --> 16:47.207
who can change if I want to.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.639
Just smooth out
my little edges.

16:49.639 --> 16:51.781
Wait, hold up.
OK, so, after my great speech,

16:51.781 --> 16:53.583
you're still going to change
your personality with magic?

16:53.583 --> 16:55.685
Just the parts
that nobody likes.

16:55.685 --> 16:57.547
So, you're going to change
your whole personality?

16:59.389 --> 17:01.091
I owed you
for the clambake comment.

17:01.091 --> 17:03.093
- All right.
- Yeah, that's good.

17:04.394 --> 17:06.626
Selfish, mean and tired
of rejection.

17:06.626 --> 17:09.529
Take these parts
to a place of reflection.

17:11.601 --> 17:12.632
Alex, are you OK?

17:12.632 --> 17:16.435
I think so. Did it work?

17:16.435 --> 17:18.407
I don't know.
You look the same.

17:18.407 --> 17:19.809
Here, let me test you.

17:19.809 --> 17:21.641
What do you think
of my clambake outfit?

17:21.641 --> 17:23.542
Mm.
It's horrible...

17:24.814 --> 17:26.675
...that you didn't
make me one.

17:26.675 --> 17:27.646
Oh, it worked!

17:27.646 --> 17:29.679
I'm totally nice! [exclaims]

17:30.720 --> 17:32.582
Wait.

17:32.582 --> 17:34.324
If you still have
all your good parts,

17:34.324 --> 17:35.555
where did all
your bad parts go?

17:35.555 --> 17:39.459
Hey! Let me out of here,
you ugly hags!

17:39.459 --> 17:42.192
And I found my bad parts.

17:42.192 --> 17:44.634
Oh, come on.
She doesn't seem that bad.

17:44.634 --> 17:48.138
I can smell that nasty outfit
all the way from here!

17:48.138 --> 17:49.599
Oh, I am not
afraid of you!

17:49.599 --> 17:51.801
Well, come and get me,
lobster girl!

17:51.801 --> 17:55.445
Harper,
don't let me taunt you.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.608
Hey, maybe she's
like a bird.

17:58.608 --> 18:00.480
She'll be quiet
if we cover her up.

18:00.480 --> 18:05.385
- Hey! Take this off!
- [banging]

18:08.618 --> 18:14.464
Oh, Alex. You have no idea
what you've started.

18:26.536 --> 18:27.577
Did you find Max?

18:27.577 --> 18:28.678
No.

18:30.440 --> 18:33.413
But I found out where
my cousins keep their cannolis.

18:33.413 --> 18:35.685
Jerry, you're supposed to be
looking for your son,

18:35.685 --> 18:36.686
not dessert.

18:37.547 --> 18:39.649
Let me have a bite of that.
Come on.

18:39.649 --> 18:42.392
- Oh, Max!
- Where?

18:43.723 --> 18:46.496
Oh! Mmm.

18:46.496 --> 18:49.799
Let's just go home and try to
lure Max back with this cannoli.

18:49.799 --> 18:51.801
- OK.
- What I'm saying.

18:51.801 --> 18:54.234
There's not
going to be any left.

18:54.234 --> 18:57.337
- Let's get a couple to go.
- OK.

18:57.337 --> 19:00.570
[Italian accent]
Where are you going? Thieves!

19:00.570 --> 19:04.544
Buon giorno.
We're just looking for our son.

19:04.544 --> 19:05.715
We're not stealing.

19:11.521 --> 19:14.924
Carmela? Cousin Carmela?
[laughs]

19:14.924 --> 19:16.356
Jerry Russo!

19:16.356 --> 19:19.489
Bianca, Gino,
put your wands down.

19:20.760 --> 19:25.695
Geraldo! Cugino Geraldo!

19:25.695 --> 19:30.440
Look at you. You still have
a baby face. It's so smooth.

19:30.440 --> 19:33.543
That's just the grease
from the cannoli.

19:33.543 --> 19:34.844
Carmela, this is my wife,
Theresa.

19:34.844 --> 19:38.308
- Oh, Theresa!
- Nice to meet... too tight.

19:38.308 --> 19:42.412
Too thin. This one
is like a breadstick.

19:42.412 --> 19:44.914
Hey, Geraldo,
what are you doing here?

19:44.914 --> 19:46.956
The reunion
isn't for month, huh?

19:46.956 --> 19:49.319
Oh, who cares? Let's eat.

19:49.319 --> 19:54.264
[calling in Italian]

19:54.264 --> 19:55.625
[speaking Italian]

19:55.625 --> 19:57.327
Benvenuto!

19:57.327 --> 19:58.598
Max.

19:58.598 --> 20:01.631
Sorry. I just love
meeting people. Hi, Max Russo.

20:01.631 --> 20:04.634
We have been looking
all over for you.

20:04.634 --> 20:07.607
This is our son, Max.
I'm sorry.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.909
He saw a pretty girl
through the Wizard Speed Pass

20:09.909 --> 20:10.910
and came to find her.

20:10.910 --> 20:13.583
You have a Wizard Speed Pass?

20:13.583 --> 20:15.685
Ohh-ho-ho-ho.

20:15.685 --> 20:19.549
Only the most powerful wizards
can create those.

20:19.549 --> 20:22.822
Ah, but your family wizard,
Alex Russo.

20:22.822 --> 20:25.325
Yes. Alex is very powerful,

20:25.325 --> 20:29.699
and very
[accent] irresponsible!

20:29.699 --> 20:32.231
[scoffs] Just 'cause you
say it loud and weird

20:32.231 --> 20:33.903
doesn't make it Italian,
Jerry.

20:35.535 --> 20:37.637
[chuckling]

20:37.637 --> 20:39.509
There's that girl.
I have to meet her.

20:39.509 --> 20:41.641
She might be the future
Mrs. Max Russo.

20:41.641 --> 20:44.344
Mrs. Russo!
Mrs. Russo!

20:44.344 --> 20:47.317
[laughs]
Your son likes Francesca?

20:47.317 --> 20:50.520
[all laughing]

20:50.520 --> 20:51.981
What's so funny?

20:51.981 --> 20:56.726
Francesca is his cousin!
[laughs]

20:56.726 --> 20:58.628
Eww.

20:58.628 --> 21:01.391
Theresa, did Geraldo
ever tell you

21:01.391 --> 21:04.564
that we were wizards
in training at the same time?

21:04.564 --> 21:06.666
We had so much fun.

21:06.666 --> 21:09.539
Geraldo, remember
I used to tickle you?

21:09.539 --> 21:11.971
[laughing]

21:11.971 --> 21:13.673
Stop, stop!
Get the breadstick.

21:13.673 --> 21:15.274
Get the breadstick.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.447
No. No, oh no.

21:17.447 --> 21:19.479
[screaming]

21:25.455 --> 21:27.457
So, what do you
think about

21:27.457 --> 21:29.489
taking accordion
lessons with me?

21:29.489 --> 21:31.391
[Alex] Well, why wouldn't I?
You're my best friend.

21:33.493 --> 21:36.696
It's like a dream come true.

21:36.696 --> 21:37.997
OK. I'm ready!

21:37.997 --> 21:40.430
What do you think?

21:40.430 --> 21:42.402
I think it's
missing something.

21:43.603 --> 21:46.706
Come here. Oh.

21:46.706 --> 21:48.408
Oh, this is the best
day of my life.

21:48.408 --> 21:49.809
Oh, I'm so happy
you're happy.

21:49.809 --> 21:52.041
Thank you, Alex.
You're such a good friend.

21:52.041 --> 21:53.383
Now, take it off.

21:53.383 --> 21:54.684
Why?

21:54.684 --> 21:55.715
Because even though I love

21:55.715 --> 21:57.086
that you finally
appreciate something

21:57.086 --> 21:58.848
I like to do,
it's just not you.

21:58.848 --> 22:00.620
And I don't need it to be.

22:01.621 --> 22:02.722
Thank you.

22:02.722 --> 22:05.555
Besides, I can pull off
a clambake outfit.

22:05.555 --> 22:07.457
On you,
it just looks stupid.

22:08.928 --> 22:11.100
[glass shatters]

22:11.100 --> 22:12.502
What was that?

22:12.502 --> 22:13.863
[sighs] Something I think

22:13.863 --> 22:16.105
is going to take up
the rest of the day.

22:16.105 --> 22:17.737
Harper, grab the fishing net.

22:17.737 --> 22:19.669
We might need it to catch me.

22:26.776 --> 22:28.748
Yup. I broke out.

22:28.748 --> 22:30.650
OK, where would
a bad Alex go?

22:30.650 --> 22:35.755
Usually, only as far as the
couch, but that door is open.

22:38.057 --> 22:39.489
What are you doing?

22:40.560 --> 22:41.561
You know, I really
should have

22:41.561 --> 22:42.892
made a shawl
out of this net.

22:44.093 --> 22:47.036
[speaking Italian]

22:47.036 --> 22:50.099
Carmela, this cheese
is amazing.

22:50.099 --> 22:52.902
Papa Fabrizio makes it.

22:52.902 --> 22:54.644
Ehh.

22:56.746 --> 22:59.509
We need find me
before I do something bad...

23:00.850 --> 23:03.983
Hi, Mom and Dad.
Guess what? I've changed.

23:03.983 --> 23:06.716
Yeah, into
a third grade art project.

23:08.618 --> 23:09.859
No, no, no.
Not that, Dad.

23:09.859 --> 23:12.161
Guess what? All the part of me

23:12.161 --> 23:13.993
that has all of those
bad things is gone.

23:13.993 --> 23:18.468
Yup. Gone.
Nowhere to be seen.

23:18.468 --> 23:19.499
Unless of course
you've seen it.

23:19.499 --> 23:23.102
Mom, Dad, from now on
I promise to be

23:23.102 --> 23:25.575
the unselfish grown-up
you expect me to be.

23:27.577 --> 23:28.708
I don't believe her.

23:28.708 --> 23:31.441
Me neither.

23:31.441 --> 23:34.413
Seriously, why are you
wearing a clambake outfit?

23:34.413 --> 23:36.115
Because my best friend
asked me to.

23:36.115 --> 23:38.688
Dad, sometimes
you need to do things

23:38.688 --> 23:39.849
to make others happy.

23:41.451 --> 23:42.722
[both laugh]

23:42.722 --> 23:44.524
Now, I definitely
don't believe her.

23:44.524 --> 23:48.758
Look, I still don't like
the way we got here,

23:48.758 --> 23:51.030
but they're feeding us.

23:51.030 --> 23:53.533
So you might as well
meet the family.

23:53.533 --> 23:56.205
Everyone, I'd like you to meet
our friend Harper,

23:56.205 --> 23:58.738
and our family wizard, Alex!

23:58.738 --> 24:00.740
[all] Ohh.

24:00.740 --> 24:04.744
So cute.
Pooka-pooka-pooka!

24:04.744 --> 24:06.476
Just like your father!

24:06.476 --> 24:08.217
[Alex]
Why is she tickling me?

24:08.217 --> 24:10.019
Pooka-pooka-pooka!

24:14.854 --> 24:17.557
Excuse me,
I'm looking for a girl

24:17.557 --> 24:19.729
that's about this tall
and this beautiful...

24:26.095 --> 24:27.737
Hey it's you.

24:27.737 --> 24:29.038
[speaking Italian]

24:29.038 --> 24:30.670
You know my name?

24:30.670 --> 24:33.743
Or, wait, does it just take that
long to say my name in Italian?

24:33.743 --> 24:36.906
[speaking Italian]

24:36.906 --> 24:38.778
I don't understand
what you're saying right now.

24:38.778 --> 24:40.880
I'll try the language
of love with you.

24:42.552 --> 24:45.054
[speaking Italian]

24:45.054 --> 24:46.756
OK, maybe you don't
speak that language.

24:46.756 --> 24:49.258
[speaking Italian]

24:49.258 --> 24:52.021
Oh, Max. I'll save you.

24:52.021 --> 24:53.763
[laughs] Not really.

24:55.995 --> 24:59.569
[continues in Italian]

25:03.773 --> 25:07.737
Thanks, Alex. They kiss
really weird here.

25:07.737 --> 25:11.210
All right.
I'm safe in a bracelet. Thanks.

25:11.210 --> 25:15.645
Safe or trapped?
[chuckles]

25:15.645 --> 25:17.617
By that evil chuckle,
I'm going to go with "trapped."

25:21.050 --> 25:26.856
And this is where we press the
finest grapes in all of Tuscany.

25:26.856 --> 25:30.930
That looks like hard work.

25:30.930 --> 25:34.003
Please. Stomping your feet
isn't hard work.

25:35.635 --> 25:39.008
Filling bread rolls
with cold cuts all day.

25:39.008 --> 25:41.871
That's hard work.

25:41.871 --> 25:45.645
Geraldo,
why don't you try it?

25:45.645 --> 25:47.316
Oh, no. No, thanks.

25:47.316 --> 25:51.550
- Pooka-pooka-pooka!
- [laughing] OK. OK.

25:51.550 --> 25:52.682
[laughs]

25:52.682 --> 25:55.585
- You too, Theresa.
- Oh, no, no, no. I'm OK.

25:55.585 --> 25:57.687
- Get in.
- No, no, no.

25:57.687 --> 25:59.659
- Theresa, get in.
- No thank you.

25:59.659 --> 26:00.289
Get in!

26:01.731 --> 26:03.733
Si, senora.

26:03.733 --> 26:06.135
It's nice to appreciate
my mom and dad

26:06.135 --> 26:07.737
doing something together.

26:07.737 --> 26:08.698
Old me would've just
been thinking

26:08.698 --> 26:10.870
of ways to make fun of them.

26:10.870 --> 26:12.772
- Oh.
- Oh.

26:12.772 --> 26:16.075
- Oh, it's so squishy.
- Ohh.

26:16.075 --> 26:19.779
Ugh. And the worst part is,
I kind of like it.

26:21.110 --> 26:22.752
Thanks a lot, Jerry.

26:22.752 --> 26:24.183
You know what
this reminds me of?

26:24.183 --> 26:25.785
The time
the bathtub backed up

26:25.785 --> 26:27.687
and you made us take showers
in there anyway.

26:27.687 --> 26:30.690
Don't blame me.
You were the one who said,

26:30.690 --> 26:32.992
"Oh, handsome vineyard guy,

26:32.992 --> 26:36.065
you're so strong,
the way you squash those grapes.

26:36.065 --> 26:39.368
[scoffs]
I never said that.

26:39.368 --> 26:42.702
- Oh, yes, you did.
- Oh, please.

26:44.003 --> 26:45.775
- [gasps]
- You imagined it.

26:45.775 --> 26:48.107
Oh. Oh, really?

26:48.107 --> 26:49.839
Your insecurities imagined it.

26:49.839 --> 26:50.910
Aha!

26:50.910 --> 26:52.682
Oooh.

26:52.682 --> 26:56.686
Hey, you know, they should
really have machines for this,

26:56.686 --> 26:58.387
- don't you think?
- Oh!

26:58.387 --> 27:01.290
You know what?
Yes, I do.

27:04.053 --> 27:06.095
[shouting]

27:06.095 --> 27:08.197
I would never
disrespect you like that!

27:08.197 --> 27:10.399
- Oh, honey, wait.
- What?

27:10.399 --> 27:12.862
You love me so much
you got so jealous?

27:12.862 --> 27:14.864
- Oh, honey...
- Good!

27:17.206 --> 27:19.769
Awww. They found
a way to make it worse

27:19.769 --> 27:22.341
for themselves
without my help.

27:22.341 --> 27:24.744
Changing me was great.

27:24.744 --> 27:26.645
[yelling]

27:30.820 --> 27:31.821
[laughing]

27:40.760 --> 27:43.332
My cousins!
Where did they go?

27:43.332 --> 27:46.395
Oh, no. Harper,
do you think my bad side

27:46.395 --> 27:48.437
could've done something
terrible to my parents?

27:48.437 --> 27:50.039
Hmm, let's see.

27:50.039 --> 27:52.671
All of your bad
is concentrated into one you.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.303
Do you want to finish
where that's going?

27:54.303 --> 27:56.145
I get it, I did it.

28:03.753 --> 28:05.014
Where are we?

28:05.014 --> 28:07.787
Dad. You're not
going to like this.

28:07.787 --> 28:12.461
Oh, it's just Alex. Thank you
for cleaning me up, mija.

28:12.461 --> 28:15.224
Now, get me out of here.
It's stuffy.

28:15.224 --> 28:18.697
What's your hurry? Handsome
vineyard guy waiting for you?

28:18.697 --> 28:21.430
What are you talking about?

28:21.430 --> 28:24.433
You're the one who had to prove
what a big macho man you were

28:24.433 --> 28:25.805
with your cold cuts.

28:25.805 --> 28:27.837
[exclaims]
They're delicious!

28:27.837 --> 28:29.779
[Alex] Hey, hey, hey, hey.

28:29.779 --> 28:31.781
I can't concentrate
on the evil plan

28:31.781 --> 28:34.283
we have going here if you
two are flappin' your yappers.

28:34.283 --> 28:35.384
Evil plan?

28:35.384 --> 28:36.385
You remember when I said,

28:36.385 --> 28:37.716
"You're not going to like this?"

28:37.716 --> 28:39.789
This is what
I was talking about.

28:40.790 --> 28:42.051
Who's "we?"

28:42.051 --> 28:45.724
[chuckles]
Excellent, Alex.

28:47.456 --> 28:49.358
Hello, Russos.

28:49.358 --> 28:52.161
Hey, it's that guy.
Hey, did you ever remember

28:52.161 --> 28:53.803
that message from Justin?

29:03.442 --> 29:05.274
Just as I thought.

29:07.276 --> 29:10.279
[Jerry] Alex, you don't
have to do this.

29:11.350 --> 29:13.182
So, what's next?

29:13.182 --> 29:15.454
How would my partner
like a little road trip

29:15.454 --> 29:17.456
to the Tower of Pisa?

29:25.464 --> 29:27.536
Dominic is evil?

29:27.536 --> 29:30.039
Is it weird he's even
more attractive now?

29:31.971 --> 29:33.772
Harper. He took my family.

29:33.772 --> 29:35.774
Oh yeah, right.
I won't date him.

29:41.150 --> 29:43.482
Even as a young wizard
I knew that some day

29:43.482 --> 29:46.785
my dreams, though disturbing,

29:46.785 --> 29:48.317
would come true.

29:48.317 --> 29:51.560
...and so, from this high
vantage point, we will launch

29:51.560 --> 29:53.522
the final steps to my plan

29:53.522 --> 29:55.925
to rid the world of mortals
and then...

29:55.925 --> 29:59.829
you know, it's really kind of
killer on the calves.

29:59.829 --> 30:03.002
That's a nice story, can we
get to what this thing does?

30:03.002 --> 30:06.805
Right. This device...
[laughs]

30:06.805 --> 30:08.477
...replicates spells.

30:08.477 --> 30:11.510
Once energized with
sufficient wizard power,

30:11.510 --> 30:14.213
it will cast a spell
repeatedly across Earth.

30:14.213 --> 30:17.546
I call it the
"Dominic One Thousand."

30:18.587 --> 30:20.549
Is that too self-centered?

30:20.549 --> 30:23.853
You're asking the wrong girl.

30:23.853 --> 30:26.225
I designed the
Dominic One Thousand

30:26.225 --> 30:27.596
to imprison every mortal,

30:27.596 --> 30:30.559
thereby paving the way
for a new Wizard World

30:30.559 --> 30:32.001
that I will rule.

30:32.001 --> 30:34.603
- Uh, that last part again?
- That we will rule.

30:34.603 --> 30:37.436
All that is needed
is a spell cast

30:37.436 --> 30:42.471
by our generation's most
powerful wizard, Alex Russo.

30:42.471 --> 30:45.174
All right.
Well, then let me at it.

30:45.174 --> 30:47.576
No offense,
you're just a knock-off.

30:47.576 --> 30:49.378
You don't have
all of her powers.

30:49.378 --> 30:51.350
I have enough powers
to scorch a hole

30:51.350 --> 30:52.952
in your little
purple jacket there.

30:54.383 --> 30:55.854
Point taken.

30:55.854 --> 30:59.628
All right. So, what if your "all
powerful" Alex doesn't come?

30:59.628 --> 31:02.631
Oh, she'll come...

31:05.364 --> 31:07.136
...to save her family.

31:09.598 --> 31:13.442
Wait, wait, wait. I'm confused.
Are we tiny or are they giants?

31:19.508 --> 31:21.580
So if it's called
the Leaning Tower of Pisa,

31:21.580 --> 31:23.012
where is all the pizza?

31:23.012 --> 31:24.613
What?

31:29.188 --> 31:31.660
[whispers] Alex, you need
to come up with a plan.

31:31.660 --> 31:33.662
I'm not good
with heights.

31:33.662 --> 31:36.465
Or substandard architecture.

31:36.465 --> 31:40.229
You're fine, Harper. Just don't
look down, it'll make you dizzy.

31:40.229 --> 31:43.332
Too late. Dizzy. Going down.

31:43.332 --> 31:45.274
Wait, Harper! [screams]

31:50.509 --> 31:53.983
Oh. All right then.
Ha ha.

31:53.983 --> 31:57.316
So, this is the top
of the Tower of Pisa.

31:57.316 --> 31:58.687
Whoo. Would you
check out that view.

31:58.687 --> 32:02.291
That is breathtaking.
My breath has been taken

32:02.291 --> 32:03.522
- from my lungs.
- [Alex] I know, right?

32:03.522 --> 32:05.094
We should post this
on Wiz-agram.

32:05.094 --> 32:06.325
- We should.
- Can you take a picture?

32:06.325 --> 32:08.297
[Harper] Yeah, let's do that.

32:12.661 --> 32:14.463
Ready? Say, "cheese."

32:14.463 --> 32:16.705
- Harper, run!
- [screams]

32:18.537 --> 32:21.640
Yes. [laughs]

32:21.640 --> 32:24.473
Harper has joined
your family in captivity.

32:24.473 --> 32:26.675
You let them go right now
or I'll...

32:26.675 --> 32:30.579
You'll what? Don't forget,
I have all the bad.

32:30.579 --> 32:33.452
Yeah, well...

32:33.452 --> 32:35.954
I look really cute
in that outfit.

32:35.954 --> 32:38.187
I know. I wasn't really sure
about the boots at first but...

32:38.187 --> 32:39.628
Focus on the mission.

32:40.689 --> 32:43.162
Yeah, I heard all about
your mission.

32:43.162 --> 32:45.464
Clear out the mortal world
so that you can make room

32:45.464 --> 32:47.296
to rule all evil wizards.

32:47.296 --> 32:49.498
Good. You're up to speed.
Now, for that spell...

32:49.498 --> 32:50.599
Never.

32:50.599 --> 32:53.202
Why would you
underestimate me, Alex?

32:53.202 --> 32:56.745
Perhaps you remember
my very determined uncle.

32:56.745 --> 32:58.307
He had wings.

32:58.307 --> 32:59.608
Gorog.

32:59.608 --> 33:02.311
I came to finish
what you took from my uncle.

33:02.311 --> 33:05.284
But where he failed,
I will succeed.

33:05.284 --> 33:07.286
My own wizard empire
right here on Earth!

33:07.286 --> 33:08.757
- [bell tolls]
- Ow!

33:08.757 --> 33:11.390
Why are these stupid bells here!

33:11.390 --> 33:14.063
Maybe to knock
some sense into you

33:14.063 --> 33:15.524
because I'm never
doing that spell.

33:15.524 --> 33:18.367
My family is more important
than anything.

33:18.367 --> 33:19.728
Now give me the bracelet.

33:19.728 --> 33:23.102
You're so stubborn
with that spell.

33:23.102 --> 33:25.334
Perhaps if I fill up
one more charm,

33:25.334 --> 33:27.336
it will convince you.

33:27.336 --> 33:30.279
[mimics howling]

33:31.480 --> 33:33.312
Mason!

33:33.312 --> 33:34.713
No!

33:40.189 --> 33:42.651
Mason. You're OK.

33:42.651 --> 33:44.353
Get tired of Dominic already?

33:44.353 --> 33:47.356
What? I don't care about him.

33:47.356 --> 33:49.758
He's some crazy wizard
who's weaving some sort of

33:49.758 --> 33:51.200
wicked web
to take over the world.

33:51.200 --> 33:53.562
Well, you're some kind of
wicked web weaver yourself.

33:55.134 --> 33:56.165
What are you talking about?

33:56.165 --> 33:58.036
I saw you at the villa
with Dominic,

33:58.036 --> 33:59.338
you two looked quite chummy.

33:59.338 --> 34:01.270
No. That's what I'm trying
to tell you.

34:01.270 --> 34:04.443
Dominic tricked me into
casting out my bad side.

34:04.443 --> 34:05.514
That's who you saw.

34:05.514 --> 34:07.246
There's another me
walking around.

34:07.246 --> 34:08.246
And I have to
get you out of here

34:08.246 --> 34:09.818
before she finds you.
Let's go.

34:12.081 --> 34:15.284
I knew I wasted time
with that hug.

34:15.284 --> 34:16.425
Two Alexes?

34:16.425 --> 34:18.226
Mason, get away from her.

34:18.226 --> 34:19.188
She's with Dominic,
and they're trying

34:19.188 --> 34:20.389
to take over the world.

34:20.389 --> 34:21.790
Nice try, me.

34:21.790 --> 34:23.732
Mason, she's the bad one.
Let's go.

34:23.732 --> 34:25.194
No! Don't listen to her.

34:25.194 --> 34:27.366
I'm the good one.
She's the bad one.

34:30.268 --> 34:32.201
Well, isn't this
a sticky wicket.

34:33.641 --> 34:35.603
Mason, please believe me.

34:35.603 --> 34:37.806
She's trying
to trick you.

34:37.806 --> 34:39.748
She doesn't even know
how I dress.

34:43.382 --> 34:45.484
That is something Harper
would wear.

34:45.484 --> 34:46.585
No, no, no, no.

34:46.585 --> 34:48.817
I'm wearing it because
Harper asked me to.

34:48.817 --> 34:50.619
OK, that doesn't even
sound like me.

34:57.396 --> 35:00.599
Thank goodness.
I hope you and Dominic rot.

35:00.599 --> 35:02.171
Mason, no!

35:13.682 --> 35:15.344
Where are we?

35:15.344 --> 35:17.616
The Leaning Tower Of Pisa.

35:17.616 --> 35:20.689
Oh. Very romantic.

35:20.689 --> 35:21.820
[Dominic] I think so.

35:24.623 --> 35:26.195
Dominic.

35:28.797 --> 35:31.460
Oh, no.

35:31.460 --> 35:35.334
Aww.
You picked the wrong Alex.

35:39.408 --> 35:43.912
Oh. Now, this is what I call
a "take over the world" look.

35:43.912 --> 35:46.375
As for you...

35:50.549 --> 35:52.851
Max, who joined us over there?

35:52.851 --> 35:54.483
Hey, it's Mason.

36:00.829 --> 36:06.565
What have I done? I can't even
"grow up" when I try to grow up.

36:06.565 --> 36:09.638
I don't even deserve
to be the family wizard.

36:09.638 --> 36:11.740
Justin does.

36:13.302 --> 36:15.374
And he'd know what to do.

36:15.374 --> 36:17.546
Beep, beep, boop, beep, beep...

36:17.546 --> 36:19.748
[woman] Professor Justin
Vincenzo Pepe Russo is...

36:19.748 --> 36:21.380
[groans]

36:40.429 --> 36:43.372
[Harper] People should
appreciate you for who you are,

36:43.372 --> 36:45.904
not for what they think
you should be.

36:47.376 --> 36:49.578
Harper's right.

36:49.578 --> 36:51.940
Everybody should just
get over it.

36:53.412 --> 36:57.386
I'm not perfect.
I'm just a wizard

36:57.386 --> 37:01.250
who has to save the world,
again. Uhh!

37:05.494 --> 37:08.927
OK, Dominic wants a spell?

37:08.927 --> 37:11.400
I'll give him a spell...

37:11.400 --> 37:14.232
...with a little bit
of a surprise.

37:22.311 --> 37:25.314
OK, I'm here to get
my family back. Let's do this.

37:25.314 --> 37:27.346
Excellent.

37:27.346 --> 37:31.780
Aw, she's here to save
the family. How sweet. Ugh.

37:32.781 --> 37:34.683
Dominic, give me the bracelet,

37:34.683 --> 37:36.785
and I'll do the spell
for your machine.

37:36.785 --> 37:40.529
Agreed. Give it to her.

37:41.860 --> 37:45.294
Wait. I know me.

37:45.294 --> 37:46.695
We'll give her the bracelet

37:46.695 --> 37:48.897
and she'll flash out
without doing the spell.

37:48.897 --> 37:52.841
Right. Spell first
then the bracelet.

37:52.841 --> 37:55.504
Nice try,
but I know me, too.

37:55.504 --> 37:58.407
I'll do the spell and you'll
keep my family anyway.

37:58.407 --> 37:59.708
No bracelet, no spell.

37:59.708 --> 38:02.280
- Spell first!
- Bracelet first.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.982
- Spell first!
- Bracelet first.

38:03.982 --> 38:05.484
- Spell first!
- Not doing anything...

38:05.484 --> 38:08.317
Spell first! Spell first!

38:08.317 --> 38:10.859
- Stop it!
- [bell tolls]

38:10.859 --> 38:13.021
Tower of Pisa that hurt!

38:14.763 --> 38:16.665
Alex will cast the spell
at the same time

38:16.665 --> 38:18.697
Bad Alex gives you
the bracelet, agreed?

38:18.697 --> 38:20.529
That's a good idea.

38:20.529 --> 38:22.431
Well, why didn't you think
of it first?

38:22.431 --> 38:25.334
[mocking]

38:25.334 --> 38:27.776
One wave, two waves,
three waves, four.

38:27.776 --> 38:29.077
Every mortal be no more.

38:35.784 --> 38:40.389
Excellent. The world will now
be wiped clean of mortals.

38:40.389 --> 38:41.650
- [laughs]
- [bell tolls]

38:41.650 --> 38:43.321
[grunts]

38:43.321 --> 38:45.554
And then we wipe it
clean of bells.

39:03.071 --> 39:05.444
Was this how you
wanted it to work?

39:05.444 --> 39:09.418
OK, the Leaning Tower of Pisa
may not have been

39:09.418 --> 39:10.379
the ideal place

39:10.379 --> 39:12.951
for my Dominic One Thousand,
but it's working.

39:14.523 --> 39:18.457
Every mortal will be imprisoned
in these beads.

39:18.457 --> 39:21.690
Are you sure you don't want
a bucket or something?

39:21.690 --> 39:23.361
The bracelet, please.

39:26.765 --> 39:29.938
You know, Alex,
now is the time to join us.

39:29.938 --> 39:33.442
With your powers, we can rule
more than just this world.

39:33.442 --> 39:36.104
Thank you for remembering
I'm a powerful wizard.

39:36.104 --> 39:38.447
Powerful enough
that I can undo

39:38.447 --> 39:41.109
- any spell I create.
- No!

39:41.109 --> 39:43.081
The mortals who were gone
before, can now...

39:50.118 --> 39:52.661
What are you doing?
I was about to fix everything

39:52.661 --> 39:55.093
before you guys
swirled me out of there.

39:55.093 --> 39:56.595
Well, if you're looking
for someone to blame,

39:56.595 --> 39:59.067
you can just point your fingers
at yourself.

39:59.067 --> 40:01.169
If you had fingers,
I mean.

40:01.169 --> 40:02.671
[man] Told you it was too soon.

40:02.671 --> 40:04.002
[man 2] It wouldn't
have mattered.

40:04.002 --> 40:05.974
[woman]
She's obviously stalling.

40:05.974 --> 40:07.175
Don't you understand?

40:07.175 --> 40:09.538
The spell replicator
is still capturing mortals.

40:09.538 --> 40:13.512
You have to let me go,
so I can save the world, again.

40:15.013 --> 40:17.516
There he is! Grab him, get him!

40:20.188 --> 40:23.051
[man 2] Dominic, the Crystals
of Justice recognize you

40:23.051 --> 40:25.193
as an esteemed
member of Wiztech.

40:25.193 --> 40:26.695
Do you have any testimony?

40:26.695 --> 40:29.197
I most certainly do.

40:29.197 --> 40:33.832
Alex Russo had no intention
to undo her spell.

40:33.832 --> 40:37.005
She is a powerful,
but selfish wizard.

40:37.005 --> 40:39.167
Why does everybody
keep saying that?

40:39.167 --> 40:41.209
So powerful that she put me
under her spell

40:41.209 --> 40:43.441
to take the blame
for her crime.

40:43.441 --> 40:45.073
Spell?! He's lying!

40:45.073 --> 40:46.915
You need look no further
than the fact

40:46.915 --> 40:49.177
that she extracted her
own evil personality

40:49.177 --> 40:52.751
and cast the spell
into the Dominic One Thous...

40:52.751 --> 40:54.753
Alex One Thousand.

40:55.754 --> 40:58.527
That's what she called it.

40:58.527 --> 41:00.188
[woman] Alex Russo,
do you deny this?

41:00.188 --> 41:03.191
He's twisting things.
He set me up.

41:03.191 --> 41:04.633
- [man 2] Silence!
- [gavel pounding]

41:04.633 --> 41:07.465
[man] The evidence
against you is overwhelming.

41:07.465 --> 41:11.640
After careful deliberation,
we, the Crystals of Justice,

41:11.640 --> 41:13.802
find you guilty as charged

41:13.802 --> 41:17.706
and sentence you
to no dessert for a week!

41:17.706 --> 41:21.750
Oh. Well,
that's not that bad.

41:21.750 --> 41:25.614
[man] Oh, no, sorry. I was
reading the wrong subsection.

41:25.614 --> 41:27.055
It's actually death.

41:27.055 --> 41:30.058
Death by chocolate?

41:30.058 --> 41:33.121
- [woman] No! Death by death!
- [gavel pounding]

41:33.121 --> 41:37.165
What?! No!
It's Dominic you want, not me!

41:37.165 --> 41:40.699
You will be incarcerated until
your sentence is carried out.

41:40.699 --> 41:43.632
Wait! No! Please!
You have to believe me!

41:44.272 --> 41:46.104
I didn't do anything!

41:46.104 --> 41:48.106
He has my family!

41:54.883 --> 41:56.284
I hope you got
a last glimpse of Alex

41:56.284 --> 41:57.616
before she meets her end.

41:57.616 --> 41:59.618
You won't get away with this!

41:59.618 --> 42:01.119
Already have.

42:01.119 --> 42:04.893
[laughing] You have
a girl's bracelet on!

42:04.893 --> 42:06.855
No! It's a uni-bracelet.

42:08.296 --> 42:10.128
Dominic, if you had a spine,
you'd let me out of here,

42:10.128 --> 42:12.530
so you and I can
settle this like gentlemen.

42:24.673 --> 42:27.145
[TV] This just in,
it's been reported

42:27.145 --> 42:28.747
that people around the world

42:28.747 --> 42:30.318
have been
mysteriously disappearing.

42:30.318 --> 42:33.652
As of now,
there is no official...

42:41.890 --> 42:46.735
Uhh... In other news...

42:46.735 --> 42:50.338
This is bad. We should eat.

42:57.676 --> 42:59.107
Why did I choose
the Tower of Pisa?

42:59.107 --> 43:02.150
I'm wondering the same thing,
dude.

43:02.150 --> 43:05.183
Nonetheless,
Alex is now doomed.

43:05.183 --> 43:09.287
And best of all, her loved ones
had a front row seat

43:09.287 --> 43:10.689
to her conviction.

43:12.260 --> 43:15.223
Dominic, one of those charms
is broken.

43:18.196 --> 43:20.929
- Mason.
- Yep.

43:29.607 --> 43:31.009
[sighs] This is ridiculous.

43:31.009 --> 43:32.140
I've got to try
to get out of here.

43:32.140 --> 43:35.213
Hello!
Hello!

43:40.088 --> 43:42.090
I'm going to use magic
to blow this door down,

43:42.090 --> 43:43.121
so you better stand back.

43:43.121 --> 43:45.093
And let me apologize
in advance

43:45.093 --> 43:47.095
for the mess I make.

43:47.095 --> 43:49.798
I am really nice.

43:55.263 --> 43:59.207
Double-decker bus,
that was close!

43:59.207 --> 44:02.270
Mason, I'm so glad
you're here.

44:02.270 --> 44:04.242
Look, I just want to say
I'm so sorry

44:04.242 --> 44:06.244
for ruining your picnic
and being selfish

44:06.244 --> 44:07.145
- and immature...
- Alex,

44:07.145 --> 44:08.416
there's no time
for that now.

44:08.416 --> 44:12.250
You must save humanity from
Dominic and, well, you.

44:12.250 --> 44:16.725
But I can't. I can't get out.
This dungeon is magic-proof.

44:16.725 --> 44:19.828
Well, then, let's find out
if it's werewolf-proof.

44:21.189 --> 44:23.091
[growls]

44:34.272 --> 44:35.804
Thank you.

44:35.804 --> 44:38.947
If you're really grateful,
you'd scratch behind my ears.

44:38.947 --> 44:41.149
Oh. That's the spot.
All right.

44:41.149 --> 44:42.781
- Come on, we gotta go.
- Oh.

44:42.781 --> 44:45.253
...And more people
are mysteriously disappearing

44:45.253 --> 44:46.715
around the globe.

44:46.715 --> 44:50.258
The government asks that
everyone remain calm

44:50.258 --> 44:51.860
[sobbing]
and in there houses.

44:53.862 --> 44:55.323
And now for the sports.

44:55.323 --> 45:00.198
Antonio, por favor tell all
the workers to come inside.

45:01.199 --> 45:02.200
[gasps]

45:03.902 --> 45:05.333
Ehh!

45:06.805 --> 45:10.138
Tall, skinny guy,
girl in a bikini,

45:10.138 --> 45:12.340
Italian newscaster...

45:12.340 --> 45:14.242
Ryan Gosling?

45:19.117 --> 45:21.119
Hey, guys. Don't mind me,

45:21.119 --> 45:22.951
I just dropped by
to give myself a beat down.

45:22.951 --> 45:25.924
Alex?! How did you get out?

45:25.924 --> 45:27.255
Take a guess.

45:28.356 --> 45:30.198
Dominic, it's over.

45:30.198 --> 45:31.329
You're not
gonna take over the world

45:31.329 --> 45:34.132
because I'm here
to save it, again.

45:34.132 --> 45:37.265
You're not going to be able
to save it this time.

45:37.265 --> 45:39.167
Oh, yeah?

45:43.942 --> 45:46.174
- Here...
- No, I got it. I got it.

45:46.174 --> 45:47.345
You're ruining my moment.

46:02.861 --> 46:05.033
Get her out of here before
she stops the Replicator!

46:05.033 --> 46:06.494
I'm not going anywhere.

46:06.494 --> 46:10.268
You will to protect your
family... and your home.

46:11.339 --> 46:14.142
Oh, no. Mason,
I'll be right back.

46:14.142 --> 46:17.475
No worries, love. I'll just
stay here and have a snack.

46:23.051 --> 46:24.913
What am I up to?

46:24.913 --> 46:27.956
It's kind of hard chasing me
without my sneaky side.

46:40.468 --> 46:42.800
Oh, I wish I could
just rest here.

46:53.441 --> 46:55.513
OK, maybe I don't care
about the kitchen,

46:55.513 --> 46:57.415
but now you've
messed with my couch.

47:09.297 --> 47:10.358
That's weird, right?

47:10.358 --> 47:12.130
It's really weird.

47:21.039 --> 47:23.111
Hey!

47:23.111 --> 47:26.314
You are a very ugly side of me
and it is time to go.

47:26.314 --> 47:27.315
Sure.

47:30.218 --> 47:33.051
[groans] Why didn't I see
myself doing that?

47:39.958 --> 47:41.189
Watch out for the bars.

47:41.189 --> 47:44.262
Don't get cute.
I'm the cute one.

47:57.075 --> 47:58.476
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

48:07.055 --> 48:09.087
You're right.
This is fun.

48:14.622 --> 48:17.525
[both grunting]

48:27.275 --> 48:28.306
[grunts]

48:37.445 --> 48:39.187
[grunts]

48:55.163 --> 48:57.105
Psst. Over here.

49:02.040 --> 49:04.172
[exhales]

49:04.172 --> 49:07.315
I didn't think it'd be
that hard to kick my own butt.

49:19.187 --> 49:21.489
Always underestimating me.

49:21.489 --> 49:23.691
[grunting]

49:29.067 --> 49:30.698
[chuckling]

49:34.342 --> 49:36.704
Mason! Mason, wake up!

49:36.704 --> 49:38.346
I'm so sorry.

49:38.346 --> 49:40.008
What did you do?

49:40.008 --> 49:41.249
I put your dog down.

49:42.480 --> 49:44.282
This is for Mason.

49:45.583 --> 49:46.584
Guess who?

49:46.584 --> 49:50.288
I'm back?
Darn I'm good.

49:51.219 --> 49:52.660
Drop it.

49:55.393 --> 49:56.724
And I'll take the bracelet.

50:01.329 --> 50:03.271
Oh. Finish her.

50:18.015 --> 50:20.418
OK, that definitely
got rid of me.

50:20.418 --> 50:21.549
I think.

50:21.549 --> 50:25.153
All right. Now time
to get rid of this.

50:26.224 --> 50:27.595
Alex!

50:27.595 --> 50:30.158
Don't you think your time
would be better served

50:30.158 --> 50:31.559
saving your family?

50:31.559 --> 50:33.731
Hey, I think I can
see Tokyo from here.

50:54.522 --> 50:55.683
Are you guys all right?

50:55.683 --> 50:57.225
- Yeah, we're OK.
- Good job, mija.

50:57.225 --> 50:59.187
Got a little steamy
in my bead.

50:59.187 --> 51:04.232
Clearly I can't defeat
the great Alex Russo.

51:06.534 --> 51:08.836
But think of the world
I am creating.

51:08.836 --> 51:10.568
It needs you.

51:14.302 --> 51:15.303
I need you.

51:17.345 --> 51:21.179
[screaming]

51:25.313 --> 51:27.655
No surprise. You all knew
I did not like him.

51:29.086 --> 51:32.220
Mason!
I was so scared I lost you.

51:34.322 --> 51:37.225
[mocking] Mason!
I was so scared I lost you.

51:37.225 --> 51:40.528
Ugh. Wouldn't it be nice
if I was this determined

51:40.528 --> 51:43.671
in everyday stuff?

51:43.671 --> 51:45.473
Haven't we had
enough of this?

51:45.473 --> 51:47.435
Can we just call it a day
and get back together.

51:47.435 --> 51:50.778
No way. Dominic went bye-bye,

51:50.778 --> 51:53.411
so that leaves more room
at the top for just me.

51:55.383 --> 51:57.145
And thanks to this,

51:57.145 --> 51:59.287
I'm going to
take over the world.

51:59.287 --> 52:01.389
You're really bad.

52:05.323 --> 52:06.694
I have no choice.

52:06.694 --> 52:09.227
Oh. Just as I thought.

52:09.227 --> 52:11.859
Too good for your own good.

52:14.232 --> 52:16.634
No one wins if we both
lose everything.

52:16.634 --> 52:19.367
What do you mean
lose everything?

52:23.271 --> 52:25.713
By all my power is to go.

52:25.713 --> 52:27.315
No. No, no, no.
You can't!

52:27.315 --> 52:28.546
Alex, what are you doing?

52:28.546 --> 52:31.379
She's casting the spell
to cancel all her powers.

52:31.379 --> 52:34.182
A wizard's essence,
spirit and soul

52:34.182 --> 52:35.583
will be nothing
but a lump of coal.

52:35.583 --> 52:37.325
- Alex, stop! Don't do it!
- Honey, don't do it!

52:37.325 --> 52:39.227
By all the power
vested in me

52:39.227 --> 52:41.659
my power be wrested out
and forever free.

53:06.214 --> 53:09.357
[man] Alex Russo, once again,

53:09.357 --> 53:12.720
you've shown immense bravery
in saving the world.

53:12.720 --> 53:17.194
Consequently, your guilty
verdict is hereby overturned.

53:17.194 --> 53:19.597
- [sighs]
- [chuckles] All right.

53:19.597 --> 53:22.800
[man 2] However, we cannot
ignore the fact that this,

53:22.800 --> 53:24.732
as in every time in the past,

53:24.732 --> 53:26.404
you were involved
in bringing the world

53:26.404 --> 53:27.605
to the brink of disaster.

53:27.605 --> 53:29.537
Oh, come on.
This was a good moment.

53:29.537 --> 53:32.380
We don't need
to dig up the past.

53:32.380 --> 53:34.412
How about you just
give me back my magic,

53:34.412 --> 53:36.444
and we can all go home
with a warm feeling?

53:36.444 --> 53:38.686
[woman] We have been patient,

53:38.686 --> 53:41.218
but you have failed to show
the maturity and responsibility

53:41.218 --> 53:43.551
needed to handle
being the family wizard.

53:43.551 --> 53:44.822
Therefore, we have decided

53:44.822 --> 53:47.295
that it is in the best interest
of the Wizard World

53:47.295 --> 53:49.497
that your powers
not be reinstated.

53:49.497 --> 53:51.399
Wait. Wait, please.

53:51.399 --> 53:53.801
I've been trying
to help her grow up.

53:53.801 --> 53:57.435
Just give her
another chance to change.

53:58.906 --> 54:00.268
No.

54:02.510 --> 54:05.573
I'm tired of everybody
wanting me to grow up,

54:05.573 --> 54:07.375
or to change,

54:07.375 --> 54:10.518
or to not be selfish.

54:10.518 --> 54:14.622
No one is happy
for just who I am,

54:14.622 --> 54:16.654
except for one person.

54:17.855 --> 54:20.027
This is so embarrassing.
She's talking about me.

54:21.859 --> 54:22.860
Harper.

54:24.292 --> 54:27.395
I'm sorry, dude. I thought
she was gonna say you.

54:33.371 --> 54:38.376
You're the only one that
accepts me with all my flaws.

54:38.376 --> 54:40.277
And I know that I have
a lot of them.

54:40.277 --> 54:41.879
[chuckles]

54:41.879 --> 54:43.611
And even though that
there have been times

54:43.611 --> 54:47.315
where you wanted me to change
and I didn't,

54:47.315 --> 54:49.357
you stood by me anyway.

54:51.659 --> 54:55.623
So it's OK if you
don't give me my magic.

54:55.623 --> 54:57.825
My best friend Harper
is my magic.

54:57.825 --> 55:00.368
Oh, Alex.

55:04.802 --> 55:07.735
I am so proud of you, honey.

55:07.735 --> 55:10.077
Even though you don't have
your powers,

55:10.077 --> 55:12.540
you still deserve
to be the family wizard.

55:13.581 --> 55:15.312
Here.

55:17.915 --> 55:20.418
All right.
Let's go home.

55:22.390 --> 55:23.891
[man] Perhaps...

55:23.891 --> 55:26.023
...the appreciation
you have for others

55:26.023 --> 55:28.556
is in itself very mature.

55:28.556 --> 55:30.498
It seems you have
other qualities

55:30.498 --> 55:32.360
that can make
a great family wizard.

55:32.360 --> 55:34.702
[man 2] I don't like
where this is going.

55:34.702 --> 55:37.605
[woman] There still may be
hope for you, Alex Russo.

55:37.605 --> 55:41.669
We grant you
one more chance.

55:57.855 --> 56:00.428
I have my magic back.

56:00.428 --> 56:02.830
Thank you.

56:02.830 --> 56:04.932
I'll see you the next
time I mess up.

56:09.737 --> 56:13.000
Carmela, grazie for this
beautiful family reunion.

56:13.000 --> 56:16.704
Please come visit us anytime.
[laughs]

56:16.704 --> 56:19.577
- Except you.
- [men laughing]

56:20.948 --> 56:22.810
Can I come back
and visit you sometime?

56:22.810 --> 56:27.084
[speaking Italian]

56:27.084 --> 56:30.918
"Stupido."
Wearing her down.

56:33.591 --> 56:35.392
Alex, before you go,

56:35.392 --> 56:38.426
please give some advice
to Bianca and Gino.

56:38.426 --> 56:39.967
They're our wizards
in training.

56:39.967 --> 56:42.399
Mmm. Yep.

56:42.399 --> 56:44.131
All right.
Look, guys,

56:44.131 --> 56:46.534
there's gonna be a lot
of work ahead of you.

56:46.534 --> 56:48.576
And it won't
really be easy.

56:48.576 --> 56:51.679
And one day, only one
of you will get to become

56:51.679 --> 56:54.081
the family wizard,
but until then,

56:54.081 --> 56:55.943
the most important thing
to remember is...

56:57.414 --> 57:00.017
...have as much ridiculous fun
with magic as you can.

57:00.017 --> 57:02.089
[yelling in Italian]

57:04.992 --> 57:07.695
All right. Guys,
this has been a great trip

57:07.695 --> 57:09.156
but there's no place
like home.

57:09.156 --> 57:10.157
Let's go.

57:11.428 --> 57:12.900
Uhh, hang on, Harper.

57:14.462 --> 57:16.033
[Theresa]
What happened in here?!

57:16.033 --> 57:18.135
The kitchen!
My couch!

57:18.135 --> 57:19.467
[Jerry] Alex!

57:19.467 --> 57:21.869
I think we should
stay in Italy a while.

57:28.045 --> 57:30.978
- [laughing]
- You say, "Here we go."

57:30.978 --> 57:32.079
What?

57:32.079 --> 57:34.221
- You say, "Oh, here we go."
- Oh.

57:34.221 --> 57:35.222
[man] Action!

57:35.222 --> 57:37.054
[laughing]

57:37.054 --> 57:38.726
[man] Action!

57:38.726 --> 57:40.758
[laughing]

57:40.758 --> 57:41.789
[man] Action!

57:41.789 --> 57:44.161
I still don't like
the way we got here.

57:44.161 --> 57:45.893
But they're feeding us.

57:47.094 --> 57:48.195
[laughing]

57:48.195 --> 57:52.640
[mumbling in fake Italian]

57:52.640 --> 57:54.742
Your own personal drive-in?!

57:54.742 --> 57:58.245
- [laughing]
- What? What did I do?

57:58.245 --> 57:59.777
Come on, Dad.
I-I...

57:59.777 --> 58:01.979
I spit popcorn.
I'm sorry. OK.

58:01.979 --> 58:04.081
I don't know how to say
[in accent] wizard...

58:04.081 --> 58:05.953
[laughing]

58:05.953 --> 58:09.216
I got an invitation
from my cousin, Carmela,

58:09.216 --> 58:13.120
in Italy, inviting us
to a Re-usso...

58:13.120 --> 58:14.191
[laughing]

58:14.191 --> 58:15.663
Russo.

58:15.663 --> 58:20.027
I got an invitation in Italy
for a Re-usso family reunion.

58:20.027 --> 58:21.829
[laughing]

58:22.800 --> 58:24.001
A while ago,

58:24.001 --> 58:27.134
I got an invitation
from my cousin, Carmela,

58:27.134 --> 58:28.275
in Italy...

58:28.275 --> 58:32.209
I got an invitation
from my cousin, Carmela,

58:32.209 --> 58:35.242
in Italy, inviting us
to a Re-usso...

58:36.113 --> 58:37.815
I'm not doing it!
