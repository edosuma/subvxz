WEBVTT

00:08.225 --> 00:10.706
What?

00:10.749 --> 00:13.013
Baby, are you watching Real Housewives?

00:14.710 --> 00:17.365
I was gonna change the channel,
but then somebody

00:17.408 --> 00:20.194
threw a glass of wine
and somebody flipped a table

00:20.237 --> 00:23.066
and two hours later,
I'm Team Teresa.

00:23.110 --> 00:24.981
Well, I'm Team Brandi.

00:25.025 --> 00:27.723
She could get hit by a table
and keep on drinking.

00:29.725 --> 00:30.856
Where's Malcolm?

00:30.900 --> 00:32.641
Oh, he's on a date
with Sofia.

00:32.684 --> 00:34.643
Again?

00:34.686 --> 00:36.384
Wow, this is getting serious.

00:36.427 --> 00:38.081
I can't believe I still
haven't met that girl.

00:40.431 --> 00:42.085
And I can't believe
Teresa thinks she can

00:42.129 --> 00:43.695
flip over that giant...

00:43.739 --> 00:46.089
Oh, no, she did it.

00:48.309 --> 00:49.701
Oh, hey, guys.

00:49.745 --> 00:51.268
Tina, did we order
two white people?

00:52.313 --> 00:55.272
Uh, no, uh, I did.

00:55.316 --> 00:57.100
But don't worry,
I'll take 'em to go.

00:57.144 --> 00:59.407
So what's going on?

00:59.450 --> 01:01.104
Marty invited us
to trivia night

01:01.148 --> 01:02.932
down at Ernie's Hot Spot.

01:02.975 --> 01:05.848
These Pasadena peeps
can't wait to play.

01:05.891 --> 01:09.721
Who are the Johnsons?

01:09.765 --> 01:11.636
Let me grab my jacket
and we'll go.

01:11.680 --> 01:13.029
Well, how about you guys?
You want to join us?

01:13.073 --> 01:15.771
Uh, thanks,
but I'm gonna stay in.

01:15.814 --> 01:18.817
I already took my bra off.

01:18.861 --> 01:21.820
Calvin, you want to come?Are you kidding me?

01:21.864 --> 01:23.779
The last thing I want to do
is sit around

01:23.822 --> 01:25.215
with a bunch of eggheads

01:25.259 --> 01:28.131
racing to answer "what's the
biggest lake in Africa?"

01:28.175 --> 01:29.611
ALL:
Lake Victoria.

01:30.873 --> 01:32.918
Trivia isn't exactly
my dad's thing.

01:32.962 --> 01:35.660
The only facts he knows
are the ones that he makes up.

01:35.704 --> 01:38.228
And a lot of the times
he's wrong about those.

01:38.272 --> 01:42.145
Ho, ho. So y'all think
y'all smarter than me?

01:42.189 --> 01:45.148
Ha. Smart enough not to
answer that question out loud.

01:45.192 --> 01:47.933
Well, you don't know
what I know.

01:47.977 --> 01:51.067
I know stuff that I don't know
that I know I know.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.416
Well, so you're in?

01:52.460 --> 01:53.722
Hell yeah I'm in.

01:53.765 --> 01:56.768
And, uh, for your
information, Tina,

01:56.812 --> 01:58.596
penguins can fly.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.685
They just cool where they at.

02:03.601 --> 02:05.560
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

02:05.603 --> 02:06.865
♪ Welcome to the hood.

02:13.089 --> 02:16.266
Come on, Dad, think.
We need your answer.

02:16.310 --> 02:17.528
Okay, hold on, hold on, now.

02:17.572 --> 02:20.314
You want to get this
right, don't you?

02:22.446 --> 02:25.145
I'm gonna order
the buffalo wings.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.279
I'm guessing this
is a slightly

02:29.323 --> 02:31.716
different crowd than
your dart night.

02:31.760 --> 02:34.110
Sure is.
A lot younger.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.199
More man buns.

02:36.243 --> 02:38.332
And I heard some clown
order a gin and juice

02:38.375 --> 02:40.464
with no gin.

02:40.508 --> 02:43.511
Where is my juice? I
ordered it ten minutes ago.

02:45.382 --> 02:48.951
All right! Welcome to trivia
night at Ernie's Hot Spot,

02:48.994 --> 02:51.083
sponsored by
Carla's Fluff and Fold.

02:51.127 --> 02:54.913
Tell her I sent you
and get one free fluff.

02:54.957 --> 02:57.220
Okay, y'all know how it works.

02:57.264 --> 02:59.570
I spin the wheel
and read the questions,

02:59.614 --> 03:02.965
you write down the answers
and order at least three drinks.

03:04.532 --> 03:08.057
"Astronomy." "Shakespeare."
"Foreign Films."

03:08.100 --> 03:10.407
Shouldn't those all be
under one category

03:10.451 --> 03:11.495
called "Who Cares?"

03:12.844 --> 03:14.890
Dad, I like all those things.

03:14.933 --> 03:16.674
I know.
Who cares?

03:16.718 --> 03:18.372
ERNIE:
Okay,

03:18.415 --> 03:20.417
first category is...

03:23.377 --> 03:25.466
Ooh, "World Flags."

03:25.509 --> 03:26.771
Okay,
here we go.

03:26.815 --> 03:29.470
What is the only country

03:29.513 --> 03:32.473
whose flag has five sides?

03:32.516 --> 03:34.866
I got this one.

03:34.910 --> 03:36.607
Stop sign.

03:39.654 --> 03:42.309
Uh, Dad, that's an octagon.

03:42.352 --> 03:44.920
I don't care what kind
of government it is.

03:46.965 --> 03:48.532
Okay, I know this one.

03:48.576 --> 03:49.751
It's on the tip of my tongue.

03:49.794 --> 03:51.492
I know it definitely starts
with an "L".

03:51.535 --> 03:53.885
It's Nepal.Or ends with an "L".

03:53.929 --> 03:57.454
Don't worry, sweetie, you were
about to get it.

03:57.498 --> 03:59.891
You weren't.

03:59.935 --> 04:01.893
Okay, everybody, boards up.

04:01.937 --> 04:03.373
The correct answer

04:03.417 --> 04:05.854
is Nepal.Yes!

04:05.897 --> 04:07.464
And for everybody
who got that right,

04:07.508 --> 04:10.989
hike your way to the bar
and buy yourself a Fuzzy Nepal.

04:12.339 --> 04:14.297
Okay, good warm-up.
Just got to focus.

04:14.341 --> 04:15.603
Which would be so much easier

04:15.646 --> 04:17.518
if I had
my juice!

04:17.561 --> 04:18.954
ERNIE:
Okay...

04:22.305 --> 04:23.350
Ooh!

04:23.393 --> 04:24.960
Chemistry.Yes!

04:25.003 --> 04:28.268
Pb is the chemical symbol

04:28.311 --> 04:30.531
for what common element?

04:30.574 --> 04:32.184
Ah, I know this one.

04:32.228 --> 04:34.622
Plubonium.

04:34.665 --> 04:36.319
Final answer.

04:36.363 --> 04:37.712
Seriously, Dad?
That's not even a...

04:37.755 --> 04:39.931
I said final answer.

04:39.975 --> 04:42.194
Gu-Guys, this is all me.
Just give me a second.

04:42.238 --> 04:44.632
Pb. Pb.

04:44.675 --> 04:47.025
PB and J.
Aw, great.

04:47.069 --> 04:49.071
Now I'm hungry, too.

04:50.594 --> 04:51.943
It's lead.

04:51.987 --> 04:52.944
Boards up.

04:52.988 --> 04:56.470
The correct answer is lead.

04:56.513 --> 04:58.210
Yeah.
Nice, Marty.

04:58.254 --> 04:59.821
All right.
You and me got this.Yeah.

04:59.864 --> 05:01.779
Hey, we're here, too.

05:01.823 --> 05:03.825
Yeah, I know, but I still
think we can win.

05:07.959 --> 05:09.744
Hey, Ma.

05:09.787 --> 05:12.834
Hey. Did you have a good time
with Sofia?

05:12.877 --> 05:14.836
Yes, I did.
It was great.

05:14.879 --> 05:17.534
Oh. How long have you two
been seeing each other?

05:17.578 --> 05:19.536
Uh, I don't know.
Maybe like two...

05:19.580 --> 05:21.669
73 days!

05:25.542 --> 05:27.892
When am I gonna
finally meet this girl?

05:27.936 --> 05:29.938
Look, I don't know, Ma.
Uh, soon, okay?

05:29.981 --> 05:31.374
Well, what's the problem?

05:31.418 --> 05:33.942
You act like you're afraid
to introduce her to me.

05:33.985 --> 05:36.205
I'm sorry if I wasn't
clear on that, Ma.

05:36.248 --> 05:37.728
I am terrified.

05:37.772 --> 05:39.643
Oh, uh...

05:39.687 --> 05:41.123
Malcolm, why?

05:41.166 --> 05:43.081
Because every time
I bring a girl home,

05:43.125 --> 05:45.388
you grill her like she knows
who shot Tupac.

05:45.432 --> 05:47.390
Oh, please.

05:47.434 --> 05:49.218
All moms ask questions.

05:49.261 --> 05:51.699
Oh, really?
Do all moms open with,

05:51.742 --> 05:53.396
"Hey, I'm Tina.
Do you want

05:53.440 --> 05:55.355
and are you able to have kids?"

05:57.008 --> 06:00.185
Well, what can I say?
I'm a people person.

06:00.229 --> 06:02.753
I want her to make me
more people.

06:07.541 --> 06:08.846
Hey, Dave.

06:08.890 --> 06:10.631
Hey, Calvin.

06:12.546 --> 06:14.983
Congrats on the, uh,
big trivia win last night.

06:15.026 --> 06:17.551
Yeah.
You too.

06:19.683 --> 06:21.032
Marty was on fire.

06:21.076 --> 06:23.905
So was Gemma.Yeah.

06:23.948 --> 06:27.430
Did you see how smug he was?She was being such a show-off!

06:27.474 --> 06:29.998
I mean, just because
I didn't go to college,

06:30.041 --> 06:31.521
he thinks he's smarter than me?

06:31.565 --> 06:33.654
Well, technically,
it's not "smarter than me,"

06:33.697 --> 06:36.657
it's "smarter than I."

06:36.700 --> 06:39.877
But yours sounds
way more right.

06:39.921 --> 06:41.705
All I know is
that game wasn't fair.

06:41.749 --> 06:44.708
It was rigged for
book-smart nerds like Marty.

06:44.752 --> 06:47.276
I regret the day
he learned to read.Yeah.

06:47.319 --> 06:50.627
You know, the only reason that
Gemma beat me to those answers

06:50.671 --> 06:52.673
is because I always
overthink things.

06:53.935 --> 06:56.633
Or do I?

06:56.677 --> 06:58.026
I mean, they may have
book smarts,

06:58.069 --> 06:59.462
but we've got street smarts.

06:59.506 --> 07:01.159
Yeah, you know what,
of we had another chance,

07:01.203 --> 07:03.292
we would bust a cat
in their ass.

07:06.817 --> 07:09.429
It's-it's a "cap," Dave,
not a cat.

07:12.388 --> 07:15.086
That does seem a lot easier.

07:16.523 --> 07:18.263
But like you said,

07:18.307 --> 07:20.265
what if we had another chance?

07:20.309 --> 07:22.137
You mean go back
to Ernie's next week?

07:22.180 --> 07:23.530
No. No, no, no.

07:23.573 --> 07:24.618
I got a better idea.

07:24.661 --> 07:26.489
We're gonna level
the playing field.

07:27.577 --> 07:29.971
Oh, I see where you're going.You do?

07:30.014 --> 07:32.103
Not at all, but I trust you.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.935
So, do you eat sushi a lot?Not often.

07:37.979 --> 07:41.286
But I did once swallow
Marty's goldfish on a dare.

07:42.505 --> 07:44.986
Oh, my...

07:46.509 --> 07:48.206
Oh, my goodness.

07:48.250 --> 07:50.426
Malcolm,
what are you doing here?

07:50.470 --> 07:54.038
You mean eating at the place
I told you I would be?

07:54.082 --> 07:56.780
You did?

07:56.824 --> 07:59.435
That must be why
I'm in the mood for sushi.

08:02.264 --> 08:04.658
Ah... So, uh,

08:04.701 --> 08:07.878
aren't you gonna introduce me?

08:07.922 --> 08:10.315
Mom, this is Sofia.
Sofia...

08:10.359 --> 08:11.752
prepare yourself.

08:13.797 --> 08:15.538
It's nice to meet you,
Mrs. Butler.

08:15.582 --> 08:17.671
So nice to meet you, too.

08:17.714 --> 08:19.673
Scoot over, Malcolm.

08:21.022 --> 08:24.547
Uh, Ma, this is awkward.

08:24.591 --> 08:26.157
Ew, so is eating with sticks.

08:26.201 --> 08:28.420
A sister's gonna need
a fork up in here.

08:31.162 --> 08:33.338
Thanks for
helping us, Marty.

08:33.382 --> 08:35.210
Yeah, us two dummies,

08:35.253 --> 08:36.603
we tried everything,

08:36.646 --> 08:38.909
but we couldn't get
the Wi-Fi to work.

08:40.694 --> 08:43.566
Routers can be pretty
complicated, especially when

08:43.610 --> 08:45.350
you haven't plugged them in.

08:46.438 --> 08:49.920
Oh. Hey, guys.

08:49.964 --> 08:51.139
What are you
all doing?

08:51.182 --> 08:52.793
Well, one of us
is plugging in your router

08:52.836 --> 08:54.708
and the other two are
acting super sketchy.

08:57.145 --> 08:58.842
Dave, what's going on?

08:58.886 --> 09:00.627
It's rematch time!

09:01.889 --> 09:04.761
You two are going down.

09:06.197 --> 09:09.287
Welcome to Trivia Night,
Home Edition.

09:11.376 --> 09:13.465
Sponsored by

09:13.509 --> 09:15.163
Calvin made me do it.

09:22.605 --> 09:25.303
All right, it is game time.

09:25.347 --> 09:27.262
Calvin and Dave versus

09:27.305 --> 09:28.829
Gemma and Marty.

09:28.872 --> 09:30.308
Tonight's drink
specials are

09:30.352 --> 09:32.572
make it yourself.
This ain't my house.

09:32.615 --> 09:34.443
Dad,

09:34.486 --> 09:36.445
why are you doing this?

09:36.488 --> 09:39.666
To prove that me and Dave
are just as smart as you two.

09:39.709 --> 09:42.364
Oh, so you two actually think
you can beat us?

09:42.407 --> 09:44.584
Yeah, the guys who
were both convinced

09:44.627 --> 09:47.978
the tallest peak in California
was Space Mountain.

09:48.022 --> 09:50.502
Uh, hello?

09:50.546 --> 09:53.680
You start on land
and end in space.

09:55.899 --> 09:58.380
All right, then.
You asked for it.

09:58.423 --> 09:59.947
Let's do this.

09:59.990 --> 10:02.036
Ha. Okay.

10:02.079 --> 10:03.994
Before you get too cocky,

10:04.038 --> 10:05.735
we added a couple
of new categories

10:05.779 --> 10:08.085
about some actual
important knowledge.

10:08.129 --> 10:10.348
Yeah.Okay. Uh...

10:10.392 --> 10:13.395
"Making Ends Meet."

10:13.438 --> 10:16.137
"Tools and Their Uses."

10:16.180 --> 10:18.182
"Famous Daves"?

10:18.226 --> 10:19.706
And I'll be one

10:19.749 --> 10:22.186
after I lay
the snackdown.

10:23.405 --> 10:25.407
Dave, it's "smackdown."

10:25.450 --> 10:26.669
No, no, no, I know.

10:26.713 --> 10:27.757
I was just gonna
put some food out.

10:30.455 --> 10:32.327
So, Sofia, you're a teacher.

10:32.370 --> 10:33.763
That means you must
like children.

10:33.807 --> 10:35.504
Oh, yes, I love 'em.

10:35.547 --> 10:37.288
They're like little
gifts from God.

10:37.332 --> 10:40.552
Ooh, a two-for-one answer.

10:40.596 --> 10:43.164
Oh. You got to keep this
one around, Malcolm.

10:45.166 --> 10:46.820
I'm trying to.

10:48.735 --> 10:51.172
So tell me about your family.
Do they live in town?

10:51.215 --> 10:52.608
Yes.
Boyle Heights.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.741
Oh. It must be nice
to have them nearby.

10:54.784 --> 10:56.003
Do you see them a lot?

10:56.046 --> 10:58.222
All the time.
In fact, Malcolm and I

10:58.266 --> 11:00.050
just had dinner
with them last week.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.751
Is that right?

11:06.013 --> 11:08.276
So you all just met last week?

11:08.319 --> 11:10.452
Can a brother get
some sake up in here?

11:12.280 --> 11:13.716
Oh, no, that's not
when they met.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.544
We all went to a Lakers game
last month.

11:18.547 --> 11:21.289
Well, isn't that nice?

11:21.332 --> 11:23.900
You know, everybody
just meeting and greeting

11:23.944 --> 11:25.554
and going to games.

11:25.597 --> 11:28.296
Ain't nobody met my ass.

11:29.776 --> 11:31.342
All right, look, Ma,
I can explain.

11:31.386 --> 11:33.736
No, no, no, no.
Don't bother.

11:33.780 --> 11:35.303
I've heard plenty.

11:35.346 --> 11:38.349
Sofia, enjoy the rest
of your evening, and Malcolm,

11:38.393 --> 11:39.699
you're dead to me.

11:42.310 --> 11:46.009
Okay, the category
is "Making Ends Meet."

11:47.358 --> 11:49.317
"You just moved,

11:49.360 --> 11:51.885
"you're trying to get
your lights on,

11:51.928 --> 11:54.496
"but you got bad credit.

11:56.237 --> 11:57.499
What do you do?"

11:58.543 --> 12:00.284
Put the bill
in your baby's name.

12:02.025 --> 12:04.245
Correct!Yes! Yes.

12:04.288 --> 12:06.856
What kind
of trivia question is that?

12:06.900 --> 12:08.162
A good one.

12:09.163 --> 12:10.686
One that
someone might

12:10.730 --> 12:12.775
actually use
in their life.

12:12.819 --> 12:15.299
Wait a minute, is that
why my credit history

12:15.343 --> 12:17.345
goes back to
when I was five?

12:19.521 --> 12:21.479
ERNIE:
Okay.

12:21.523 --> 12:24.221
So the score
is Calvin and Dave: eight,

12:24.265 --> 12:26.267
Gemma and Marty: three.

12:26.310 --> 12:30.053
And still zero dollars
in my tip jar.

12:30.097 --> 12:33.187
Okay. Dave, can I talk to you
in the kitchen for a second?

12:33.230 --> 12:34.797
Yeah, but we're right
in the middle...

12:34.841 --> 12:36.103
Wrong answer.

12:40.281 --> 12:42.239
I can't believe you.

12:42.283 --> 12:44.502
I know. I totally pulled
"Davy Crockett"

12:44.546 --> 12:46.809
out of my butt back there.

12:46.853 --> 12:49.029
That's not what
I'm talking about.

12:49.072 --> 12:51.031
I'm talking about
how important it is

12:51.074 --> 12:53.120
for you to prove
that you're smarter than me.

12:53.163 --> 12:54.904
No, it's not. And...

12:54.948 --> 12:58.255
technically,
it's "smarter than I."

13:00.083 --> 13:02.390
Maybe, when you're using "than"
as a conjunction

13:02.433 --> 13:03.870
with an implied "am."

13:03.913 --> 13:06.307
But I just used it
as a preposition.

13:09.658 --> 13:12.966
Okay, I owe Calvin an apology.

13:13.009 --> 13:16.230
So I'm better at trivia
than you. Big deal.

13:16.273 --> 13:18.188
Why are you being so insecure?

13:18.232 --> 13:20.321
I'm not insecure.
I'm the most secure.

13:20.364 --> 13:22.714
I-I'm the securest.

13:22.758 --> 13:24.194
Ugh.

13:24.238 --> 13:26.196
And I know that's not a word.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.416
That's just how secure I am.

13:30.244 --> 13:33.203
Fine, don't admit it to me, but
at least admit it to yourself:

13:33.247 --> 13:35.292
you're being a giant baby.

13:37.164 --> 13:40.167
Well, you see,
that's why you're losing.

13:40.210 --> 13:42.560
A giant baby is just
a normal-sized adult.

13:52.048 --> 13:53.006
Hey.

13:53.049 --> 13:55.965
Ah. Look who's home early.

13:56.009 --> 13:58.054
I thought maybe you'd be out
getting a family portrait

13:58.098 --> 13:59.839
with Sofia's parents.

14:01.884 --> 14:03.886
Ma, will you stop?

14:03.930 --> 14:05.932
You met her parents, Malcolm.

14:05.975 --> 14:09.283
More than once, but you wouldn't
let her meet me?

14:09.326 --> 14:11.502
Your father I get, but me?

14:13.417 --> 14:15.245
Do I really embarrass you
that much?

14:15.289 --> 14:17.204
Ma, you asked Sofia
if she'll be wearing white

14:17.247 --> 14:18.945
on her wedding day.

14:18.988 --> 14:21.948
Malcolm, I'm sorry
that you feel the need

14:21.991 --> 14:23.950
to protect your girlfriends
from me.

14:23.993 --> 14:26.343
I didn't realize
I was such a horrible mother.

14:29.303 --> 14:31.871
Look, Ma, I'm not just
protecting them.

14:31.914 --> 14:33.873
I'm also protecting you.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.309
From what?

14:35.352 --> 14:37.354
Every time I introduce you
to a girl,

14:37.398 --> 14:39.139
you get so invested.

14:39.182 --> 14:41.315
You get to know them,
you get close to them,

14:41.358 --> 14:43.317
and when it doesn't work out,
it breaks your heart.

14:43.360 --> 14:46.320
That is not true.

14:46.363 --> 14:47.799
Oh, really?

14:47.843 --> 14:49.889
When I broke up with Jessica,
you kept

14:49.932 --> 14:53.066
sneaking out to see her
for three more weeks.

14:53.109 --> 14:55.198
I just needed more time, okay?

14:57.157 --> 14:59.681
Look, Ma, you know I love you.

14:59.724 --> 15:02.118
But it's hard enough for me
to get over a girl.

15:02.162 --> 15:04.729
I don't want to have to worry
about you getting over her, too.

15:04.773 --> 15:07.471
I guess I just keep hoping
every girl you bring home

15:07.515 --> 15:09.169
is gonna be the one.

15:09.212 --> 15:11.911
Ah, don't worry about it.
One of them will be.

15:13.434 --> 15:15.305
Hey, maybe Sofia.
We'll see.

15:16.393 --> 15:18.918
Okay.

15:18.961 --> 15:21.398
Well, as long
as it's not that Jessica.

15:21.442 --> 15:24.706
No, that bougie skank
totally ghosted me.

15:26.403 --> 15:29.450
Okay, we are neck and neck

15:29.493 --> 15:34.498
after an epic collapse
from Calvin and Dave.

15:34.542 --> 15:36.587
What the hell is with you?

15:36.631 --> 15:38.720
You just blew
four answers in a row.

15:38.763 --> 15:40.504
In a question
about "Famous Daves,"

15:40.548 --> 15:43.333
you answered Stephen King.

15:43.377 --> 15:45.292
Well, I'm sorry, Calvin.

15:45.335 --> 15:47.511
I guess I'm just
not that smart.

15:47.555 --> 15:50.950
And I'm totally okay with it.

15:50.993 --> 15:52.516
You're an idiot.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.475
Exactly.

15:54.518 --> 15:56.042
Okay, am I missing
something?

15:56.085 --> 15:58.348
I am. Tips in my jar.

16:00.568 --> 16:02.265
Here's a quarter.

16:02.309 --> 16:03.527
Spin the damn wheel.

16:03.571 --> 16:07.879
Okay, we are all tied up,

16:07.923 --> 16:10.839
and apparently, since I'm
doing this for a quarter,

16:10.882 --> 16:12.362
this will be

16:12.406 --> 16:14.277
our last question.

16:17.759 --> 16:19.152
Ooh. "Auto Parts."

16:19.195 --> 16:21.023
MARTY:
Come on.
That's not fair.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.416
He's a mechanic.

16:22.459 --> 16:24.418
Ah, guys, do you want
to call it now,

16:24.461 --> 16:26.986
or do you want to go
through the humiliation?

16:28.465 --> 16:31.599
I'm just kidding.
I want to see the humiliation.

16:32.861 --> 16:36.821
Okay. "In a car's
engine's cylinders,

16:36.865 --> 16:38.823
the valves..."

16:38.867 --> 16:42.436
Lets the fuel in
and the exhaust out.

16:42.479 --> 16:43.437
Final answer.

16:43.480 --> 16:46.179
Incorrect.What?

16:46.222 --> 16:49.660
I did not finish
asking the question.

16:49.704 --> 16:52.359
"In a car engine's
cylinders,

16:52.402 --> 16:55.884
"the valves let the fuel in
and the exhaust out.

16:55.927 --> 16:58.887
This part moves the valves."

16:58.930 --> 17:00.497
MARTY:
Okay, okay, okay.

17:00.541 --> 17:02.151
Okay. I can figure this out.

17:02.195 --> 17:05.676
Um, the spark plugs
ignite the fuel,

17:05.720 --> 17:08.375
which fires the pistons,
which turns

17:08.418 --> 17:11.291
the crankshaft, which is
attached to the timing belt,

17:11.334 --> 17:14.250
which turns the camshaft.

17:14.294 --> 17:16.426
Correct!Yes!

17:18.298 --> 17:21.997
Marty and Gemma win,
and I am out of here.

17:25.827 --> 17:28.786
Well, looks like you were wrong.

17:28.830 --> 17:30.571
Clearly, I have
nothing to prove.

17:30.614 --> 17:34.749
Which, if you think about it,
proves I was right.

17:34.792 --> 17:36.794
You know what
it proves to me?

17:36.838 --> 17:38.709
That you're sleeping alone
tonight.

17:41.408 --> 17:42.757
Wait. I take it back.

17:42.800 --> 17:45.194
I was wrong
about being right.

17:45.238 --> 17:48.371
Well, Dad,
I guess I win again.

17:48.415 --> 17:50.678
Well, that's only 'cause I hit
the buzzer too fast.

17:50.721 --> 17:52.158
You know what I mean?

17:52.201 --> 17:54.247
The problem
is my cat-like reflexes.

17:55.639 --> 17:57.032
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.730
Heads up.Hey... Oh, hey...

18:01.254 --> 18:03.734
You saw how I blocked that,
right? I blocked that.

18:03.778 --> 18:06.302
Come on, Dad,
what's really going on here?

18:06.346 --> 18:10.611
Look, son, just because
you know a few random facts

18:10.654 --> 18:14.876
and have a degree, i-it's not
all the smart that you need.

18:14.919 --> 18:16.138
What are you talking about?

18:16.182 --> 18:18.445
Not everybody gets
to go to college.

18:18.488 --> 18:19.924
I mean, I was
gonna go,

18:19.968 --> 18:21.578
but then your grandfather
got sick

18:21.622 --> 18:25.495
and I had to go to work
at his shop.

18:25.539 --> 18:27.410
I-Is that what this is about?

18:27.454 --> 18:30.631
Dad, I-I don't think
I'm smarter than you.

18:30.674 --> 18:31.501
You don't?

18:31.545 --> 18:33.068
No.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.201
How do you think
I knew all that car stuff?

18:35.244 --> 18:37.072
When I was a kid,
I followed you around,

18:37.116 --> 18:38.639
soaking up everything you said.

18:38.682 --> 18:39.640
And then, because of
all your hard work,

18:39.683 --> 18:41.032
I got to go to college,

18:41.076 --> 18:43.122
where I learned
half of it was wrong.

18:45.559 --> 18:47.517
Well,

18:47.561 --> 18:50.346
thanks to me,
you got out of kindergarten

18:50.390 --> 18:52.305
with an 800 credit score, so...

18:54.568 --> 18:58.572
Seriously, Dad, I'm only
where I am because of you.

18:58.615 --> 19:00.313
So thanks.

19:00.356 --> 19:02.315
You're welcome, son.

19:04.665 --> 19:06.362
Well, would you look at that?

19:06.406 --> 19:08.930
Looks like there are
no losers tonight.

19:11.237 --> 19:13.804
Well, looks like
I'm sleeping on the couch.

19:15.676 --> 19:17.678
I stand corrected.

19:27.122 --> 19:28.384
Hey.

19:33.041 --> 19:35.478
I thought of another
trivia question.

19:35.522 --> 19:38.699
"Which famous Dave acted
like a total idiot tonight?"

19:42.268 --> 19:45.445
Me.

19:45.488 --> 19:47.447
Or I.

19:47.490 --> 19:50.101
I honestly don't know.

19:50.145 --> 19:52.887
Can you please just tell me
why it was so important

19:52.930 --> 19:54.541
to prove you're smarter than me?

19:54.584 --> 19:56.630
Gemma, don't pretend
like you don't know.

19:56.673 --> 19:57.805
Know what?

19:57.848 --> 19:59.415
Well, that everyone thinks

19:59.459 --> 20:02.244
that you're so accomplished
and smart and...

20:03.637 --> 20:05.639
...I'm just some hot
trophy husband.

20:08.119 --> 20:10.078
What are you talking about?

20:10.121 --> 20:13.995
Sweetie, you're the most
amazing man I know.

20:14.038 --> 20:15.301
Really?

20:15.344 --> 20:18.304
Yeah. You've got
this great big heart,

20:18.347 --> 20:20.610
you make me laugh
all the time,

20:20.654 --> 20:22.395
and how can you not
think you're smart,

20:22.438 --> 20:24.962
Mr. Treasurer
of the Kalamazoo juggling team?

20:27.313 --> 20:29.619
I kept the budget low
and the juggling clubs high.

20:31.665 --> 20:33.884
You know, you may have
lost trivia,

20:33.928 --> 20:37.018
but if you go light
some candles in the bedroom,

20:37.061 --> 20:39.238
you might win
something else instead.

20:40.674 --> 20:43.329
Are you talking about what
I think you're talking about?

20:44.721 --> 20:47.724
Correct.

20:47.768 --> 20:49.639
All right.

20:51.119 --> 20:53.426
Uh, uh...

20:53.469 --> 20:56.037
We are talking about sex, right?

20:56.080 --> 20:57.604
Yes.

21:00.215 --> 21:02.739
It's a good thing he's hot.
