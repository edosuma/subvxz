IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:07.375 --> 00:11.145
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:11.145 --> 00:13.281
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:13.281 --> 00:15.116
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:15.116 --> 00:16.617
ARE MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:16.617 --> 00:18.719
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:18.719 --> 00:21.389
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:29.330 --> 00:32.166
- AH! IT HURTS, COACH.

00:32.166 --> 00:34.435
- IT'S JUST A CRAMP.

00:34.435 --> 00:36.604
HOLD IT, LET ME SEE.

00:36.604 --> 00:38.839
LET ME WORK ON IT.

00:38.839 --> 00:41.209
LOOSEN UP A LITTLE BIT,
COME ON.

00:41.209 --> 00:42.676
RELAX.

00:42.676 --> 00:44.212
YOU CAN'T PERFORM
WHEN YOU'RE TENSE.

00:44.212 --> 00:45.479
ALL RIGHT?

00:45.479 --> 00:48.316
LOOSEN UP A LITTLE BIT,
COME ON!

00:48.316 --> 00:49.550
[grunts]

00:49.550 --> 00:51.219
HEY!

00:51.219 --> 00:52.520
CAN'T THAT WAIT?

00:52.520 --> 00:56.557
- I'LL COME BACK.
- YEAH, DO THAT.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.092
ALL RIGHT? WE GOOD?

00:58.092 --> 01:00.328
THEN BACK TO WORK.
COME ON!

01:06.234 --> 01:09.337
[car alarm beeps]

01:09.337 --> 01:10.571
UNH!

01:10.571 --> 01:12.106
[screams]

01:12.106 --> 01:13.174
[stabbing]

01:13.174 --> 01:17.145
[screams]

01:17.145 --> 01:19.247
[moans]

01:19.247 --> 01:21.615
[whimpering]

01:26.187 --> 01:28.289
- WOW.

01:28.289 --> 01:29.623
WHOA.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.859
OLIVIA.

01:31.859 --> 01:34.428
[chuckles] IT'S A LITTLE EARLY
FOR VALENTINE'S DAY--

01:34.428 --> 01:36.697
- LOOK, HE AND I DECIDED
THAT WE WEREN'T QUITE READY

01:36.697 --> 01:38.732
FOR THE WHOLE VALENTINE'S DAY
DINNER THING, SO--

01:38.732 --> 01:41.435
- SO YOU WENT
FOR THE CASUAL PRE-DINNER THING.

01:41.435 --> 01:44.138
I GET THAT.
SORRY TO PULL YOU OUT.

01:44.138 --> 01:46.740
THIS IS ALEXEI BELYAKOV,

01:46.740 --> 01:48.709
BOY'S GYMNASTICS COACH.

01:48.709 --> 01:51.912
STABBED WITH AN ICE PICK.
HE BLED A LOT.

01:51.912 --> 01:53.581
LUCKY FOR THE VIC,
EMTs GOT HERE QUICK,

01:53.581 --> 01:54.915
OR WE'D BE CALLING WARNER.

01:54.915 --> 01:56.917
- AND THIS IS
OUR CASE BECAUSE...

01:56.917 --> 01:58.919
HE WAS STABBED
IN A BAD PLACE?

01:58.919 --> 02:01.755
- UH, BOTH OF THEM.

02:01.755 --> 02:04.858
- UH, ANY CHANCE THAT CSU
CAN GET PRINTS ON THE WEAPON?

02:04.858 --> 02:08.362
- THEY'LL HAVE TO WAIT TILL
THE COACH GETS OUT OF SURGERY.

02:12.333 --> 02:15.336
[dramatic music]

02:15.336 --> 02:23.411
*

02:59.380 --> 03:00.381
- DID YOU SEE
YOUR ATTACKER'S FACE?

03:00.381 --> 03:01.449
- NO.

03:01.449 --> 03:03.451
I WAS PUTTING MY BAG
IN THE TRUNK.

03:03.451 --> 03:06.454
HE CAME FROM BEHIND,
SLAMMED THE HOOD.

03:06.454 --> 03:08.289
- HE? YOU SURE
IT WAS A MAN?

03:08.289 --> 03:09.557
- I'M POSITIVE.

03:09.557 --> 03:11.925
HE HAD ON WORK GLOVES, BOOTS.

03:11.925 --> 03:14.362
SOME KIND OF OLIVE COVERALL.

03:14.362 --> 03:18.432
- AN ATTACK LIKE THIS,
UH, COULD BE REVENGE.

03:18.432 --> 03:20.701
- YEAH, MAYBE SOMETHING
IN YOUR PERSONAL LIFE?

03:20.701 --> 03:22.570
- I'M HAPPILY MARRIED.

03:22.570 --> 03:25.773
AND I'M ON GOOD RELATIONS
WITH ALL OF MY EX-WIVES.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.308
- WAIT. ALL?

03:27.308 --> 03:28.409
- THREE.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.278
I'M A ROMANTIC.

03:30.278 --> 03:33.314
- YOU EVER BEEN ROMANTIC
WITH SOMEONE YOU SHOULDN'T?

03:33.314 --> 03:35.549
- I LEARNED THAT LESSON
FOUR YEARS AGO.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.752
A STUDENT'S FATHER ACCUSED ME
OF BEING INVOLVED WITH HIS WIFE.

03:38.752 --> 03:41.589
- AND WERE YOU?

03:41.589 --> 03:43.757
DID HE ATTACK YOU?
- NO.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.593
HE TRIED TO RUIN ME.

03:45.593 --> 03:46.960
IN THE DIVORCE TRIAL,

03:46.960 --> 03:48.429
HE ACCUSED ME
OF MOLESTING HIS SON.

03:48.429 --> 03:50.498
AND SHE ACCUSED HIM.
[coughs]

03:50.498 --> 03:51.932
I WAS A PAWN.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.401
- ANY OTHER PARENTS
THREATEN YOU?

03:53.401 --> 03:56.337
- [sighs] A STUDENT
LAST YEAR. EDDIE.

03:56.337 --> 03:57.805
I HAD TO CUT HIM.

03:57.805 --> 04:00.774
I TOLD HIS MOTHER
I CAN'T SPIN STRAW INTO GOLD.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.009
- AND THE FATHER?

04:02.009 --> 04:05.379
- CAME IN,
THREW FURNITURE AROUND.

04:08.282 --> 04:10.651
- THESE RUSSIANS,
THEY'RE ALL LIARS.

04:10.651 --> 04:13.654
MAYBE--
MAYBE I KICKED A CHAIR.

04:13.654 --> 04:15.689
- YOU WERE MAD
'CAUSE ALEXEI CUT YOUR SON.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.325
- HE PLAYED US.

04:17.325 --> 04:18.659
AND WHEN
HE WANTED OUR MONEY,

04:18.659 --> 04:20.328
HE SAID EDDIE
HAD OLYMPIC POTENTIAL.

04:20.328 --> 04:22.830
THEN HE CHARGED US A FORTUNE
FOR PRIVATE LESSONS.

04:22.830 --> 04:25.466
- I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT COACH ALEXEI.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.601
- WELL, WHY NOT, EDDIE?

04:27.601 --> 04:29.770
'CAUSE HE CUT YOU?

04:29.770 --> 04:33.841
YOU KNOW, ALL THAT WORK,
PRIVATE SESSIONS.

04:33.841 --> 04:37.311
CAN YOU
TELL ME ABOUT THOSE?

04:37.311 --> 04:39.313
- HE WOULD PRACTICE WITH ME
ON THE BARS

04:39.313 --> 04:42.316
AND HELP ME
WITH MY STRETCHING.

04:42.316 --> 04:44.518
- STRETCHING.

04:44.518 --> 04:48.322
SO WHEN HE TOUCHED YOU,
DID THAT EVER MAKE YOU FEEL...

04:48.322 --> 04:49.690
UNCOMFORTABLE?

04:49.690 --> 04:53.427
- UH, WHAT, LIKE THAT?

04:53.427 --> 04:56.464
HE WASN'T THAT WAY.

04:56.464 --> 04:57.498
NOT WITH ME.

04:57.498 --> 05:00.568
- WAS HE THAT WAY
WITH OTHER KIDS?

05:00.568 --> 05:01.869
- I DON'T KNOW.

05:01.869 --> 05:05.439
HE HAD A LOT
OF PRIVATE SESSIONS.

05:05.439 --> 05:07.708
- COACH ALEXEI'S NOT GAY.
- MAYBE NOT.

05:07.708 --> 05:09.410
BUT HE'S PRETTY HANDS-ON.

05:09.410 --> 05:11.011
- YOU SAW THAT?
- I HEARD ABOUT IT.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.546
THIS GUY AT THE GYM,
WHEN EDDIE GOT CUT,

05:12.546 --> 05:15.383
SAID EDDIE WAS BETTER OFF
AWAY FROM THE COACH.

05:15.383 --> 05:17.084
- ANOTHER PARENT?
- NO, A YOUNG GUY.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.552
KIND OF LANKY.

05:18.552 --> 05:22.055
IN A JUMPSUIT.
PROBABLY WORKED MAINTENANCE.

05:22.055 --> 05:24.492
- JOHN DUBCEK.

05:24.492 --> 05:28.896
VANDALISM, POSSESSION,
DISORDERLY CONDUCT, BAR FIGHTS.

05:28.896 --> 05:33.033
BUT NOTHING
IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS.

05:33.033 --> 05:36.704
- STRAIGHTENED MYSELF OUT.
- TILL LAST NIGHT.

05:36.704 --> 05:39.440
ALEXEI ALMOST BLED OUT.
YOU COULD HAVE KILLED HIM.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.443
- UH, I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

05:42.443 --> 05:44.077
- HOW LONG YOU BEEN WORKING
AT THAT GYM?

05:44.077 --> 05:45.679
YOU SEE HIM EVERY DAY.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.782
- I--
I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE.

05:48.782 --> 05:51.485
- WE'RE GONNA FIND YOUR PRINTS
ON THAT WEAPON.

05:51.485 --> 05:52.853
- N-NO, YOU WON'T.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.122
- WHY, 'CAUSE YOU
WERE WEARING GLOVES?

05:55.122 --> 05:58.792
HIS BLOOD IS ON THEM.
ON YOUR BOOTS TOO.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.961
YOU KNOW,
AND I DON'T GET IT.

06:00.961 --> 06:05.065
YOUR BOSS, YOUR PAROLE OFFICER,
THEY VOUCH FOR YOU.

06:05.065 --> 06:08.602
- THIS COACH, WE HEARD
HE'S REAL ARROGANT, OKAY?

06:08.602 --> 06:10.971
SO WHAT DID HE DO TO YOU?
TREAT YOU BAD?

06:10.971 --> 06:12.673
BOTHER YOUR GIRLFRIEND
OR SOMETHING?

06:12.673 --> 06:15.008
- GIRLFRIEND?
I DON'T HAVE TIME.

06:15.008 --> 06:17.411
I WORK TWO JOBS,
AND I TAKE CARE OF MY MOM.

06:17.411 --> 06:20.080
- AND YOU LIVE
WITH YOUR MOM, RIGHT?

06:20.080 --> 06:22.683
YOUR BOSS TOLD US
THAT SHE WAS SICK.

06:22.683 --> 06:25.419
- SHE'S OKAY.
SHE'S NOT GONNA DIE.

06:25.419 --> 06:28.456
- YOU WANT TO BE THERE FOR HER?
YOU GOTTA HELP YOURSELF OUT.

06:28.456 --> 06:31.024
- COME ON, ALEXEI,
WHAT DID HE DO TO YOU?

06:31.024 --> 06:32.760
HE DISRESPECTED YOU,
HE YELLED AT YOU,

06:32.760 --> 06:34.595
HE'S COMPLAINING ABOUT YOU
TO HIS BOSS--

06:34.595 --> 06:35.929
- WHAT HE DOES,

06:35.929 --> 06:39.500
HE WOULDN'T TRY WITH ME.

06:39.500 --> 06:43.403
- WHAT HE DOES TO WHO,
JOHNNY?

06:47.908 --> 06:50.143
- THIS JANITOR
SAID I ABUSE MY STUDENT?

06:50.143 --> 06:51.912
HE'S PSYCHO.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.815
- JOHNNY DUBCEK SAYS
THAT HE SAW SOMETHING WRONG.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.216
WHY WOULD HE SAY THAT?

06:56.216 --> 06:58.652
- BECAUSE HE'S A JANITOR.
AN IDIOT!

06:58.652 --> 07:00.688
- SO YOU DON'T TAPE
YOUR SESSIONS?

07:00.688 --> 07:03.824
- OF COURSE I TAPE SESSIONS.
FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE STUDENT.

07:03.824 --> 07:06.660
A KID HAS A PROBLEM
WITH DISMOUNT? FILM IT.

07:06.660 --> 07:09.096
- OKAY, SO THIS RUBDOWN
THAT JOHNNY SAW YOU TAPING--

07:09.096 --> 07:10.764
WHO DOES THAT BENEFIT?

07:10.764 --> 07:12.900
- ME.
I STARTED FILMING EVERYTHING

07:12.900 --> 07:14.602
SINCE I WAS ACCUSED.

07:14.602 --> 07:17.605
TO SHOW I HAVE
NOTHING TO HIDE.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.177
- ANYBODY LEARN ANYTHING?

07:24.177 --> 07:27.515
- YEAH, 90 HOURS OF TAPE,
AND SO FAR HIS ONLY CRIME

07:27.515 --> 07:29.016
IS BORING ME TO DEATH.

07:29.016 --> 07:30.918
- LOOK, WE TALKED
TO A LOT OF HIS STUDENTS,

07:30.918 --> 07:32.152
BOTH FORMER AND CURRENT.

07:32.152 --> 07:33.587
I MEAN,
NOBODY LIKES THE GUY,

07:33.587 --> 07:35.155
BUT NOBODY
CALLED HIM A PREDATOR.

07:35.155 --> 07:39.192
- WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE
WE OWE THE COACH AN APOLOGY.

07:39.192 --> 07:42.696
- CAPTAIN, DUBCEK BELIEVES
WHAT HE TOLD US.

07:42.696 --> 07:44.532
- LOOK, THE COACH DOES
PUT HIS HANDS ON THESE KIDS,

07:44.532 --> 07:46.667
AND MAYBE DUBCEK
MISCONSTRUED.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.536
- AND STABBED THE GUY
IN THE TESTICLES?

07:48.536 --> 07:50.103
SOMETHING SET HIM OFF.

07:50.103 --> 07:52.139
- WELL, HE'S GOT ONE LAST CHANCE
TO TELL US WHAT.

07:52.139 --> 07:55.042
HE'S BEEN ARRAIGNED.
HE'S ON HIS WAY TO RIKERS NOW.

08:02.149 --> 08:04.217
- PRISONER VAN HAS ARRIVED
AT THE FACILITY.

08:04.217 --> 08:08.021
SIX MALE PRISONERS.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.164
- [grunting]

08:17.164 --> 08:18.932
- HEY, I NEED HELP!
HE'S CHOKING HIM!

08:18.932 --> 08:20.067
- LET HIM GO!

08:20.067 --> 08:22.002
- PULL HIM OFF!
PULL HIM OFF!

08:22.002 --> 08:23.637
[indistinct chatter]

08:23.637 --> 08:24.738
- I GOT HIM.

08:24.738 --> 08:26.173
WATCH HIS HEAD.
WATCH HIS HEAD.

08:26.173 --> 08:27.575
PUT HIM ON THE DECK.

08:27.575 --> 08:30.811
- [panting]

08:34.848 --> 08:36.116
- IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.685
I TOLD THEM NOT
TO PUT ME IN WITH THAT!

08:37.685 --> 08:39.152
- PUT HIM IN THE CAR.
- WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

08:39.152 --> 08:40.654
- DUBCEK WENT NUTS
ON THE TRUCK,

08:40.654 --> 08:42.255
TRIED TO KILL
THE INMATE NEXT TO HIM.

08:42.255 --> 08:44.291
- WHAT WAS HE SAYING,
"DON'T PUT ME IN WITH THAT"?

08:44.291 --> 08:46.126
- WHEN WE HAD HIM AT
THE COURTHOUSE LOADING HIM IN,

08:46.126 --> 08:47.127
HE SAID HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE
IN THE TRUCK WITH THIS PRISONER.

08:47.127 --> 08:48.696
- THE PRISONER THREATEN HIM?

08:48.696 --> 08:50.230
- NAH, SOME PEDOPHILE ARRAIGNED
FOR TOUCHING BOY SCOUTS.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.899
- PEDOPHILE?
- UH-HUH.

08:51.899 --> 08:54.034
- IS THERE ANY CHANCE
I CAN TALK TO JOHNNY?

08:54.034 --> 08:57.705
- NOT HERE.
TRY ARRAIGNMENT.

09:00.207 --> 09:03.611
- TWO VIOLENT ASSAULTS
IN THREE DAYS, MR. DUBCEK.

09:03.611 --> 09:04.712
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU,

09:04.712 --> 09:06.580
BUT I BETTER NOT
SEE YOU HERE AGAIN.

09:06.580 --> 09:08.682
THE DEFENDANT IS REMANDED
BACK TO RIKERS.

09:08.682 --> 09:09.917
[gavel thumps]

09:09.917 --> 09:13.721
- I'M SORRY, MOM.

09:13.721 --> 09:15.723
- WE'RE NOT GETTING
TO HIM FOR A WHILE.

09:15.723 --> 09:17.691
- YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IN JOHNNY'S MIND,

09:17.691 --> 09:19.727
HE'S GONE OFF
ON TWO PEDOPHILES.

09:19.727 --> 09:23.030
THINK THE MOTHER
KNOWS WHY?

09:23.030 --> 09:24.164
- JOHNNY'S BEEN
CLEAN AND SOBER,

09:24.164 --> 09:26.366
NO TROUBLE, NO--
NO FIGHTS

09:26.366 --> 09:27.901
SINCE HE WAS A TEENAGER.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.170
- LOT OF BOYS GO THROUGH TROUBLE
DURING THAT TIME.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.139
- MM.
- WAS HIS FATHER AROUND MUCH?

09:32.139 --> 09:34.074
- NO, JOHNNY'S FATHER
DIED WHEN HE WAS TEN.

09:34.074 --> 09:37.711
- ANY OTHER MEN
IN JOHNNY'S LIFE AFTER THAT?

09:37.711 --> 09:39.212
- WELL, A FEW YEARS LATER,

09:39.212 --> 09:41.982
IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD HOUSE,
CLINTON,

09:41.982 --> 09:44.685
THIS COACH
TOOK AN INTEREST

09:44.685 --> 09:46.687
IN JOHNNY.

09:46.687 --> 09:49.723
HE EVEN MANAGED TO GET JOHNNY
INTO THE OPEN AIR CAMP UPSTATE.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.625
- DID JOHNNY
LIKE IT UP THERE?

09:51.625 --> 09:54.161
- NOT SO MUCH.

09:54.161 --> 09:57.865
COACH SCHULTZ SAID THAT
JOHNNY WAS VERY HOMESICK.

09:57.865 --> 10:01.401
AND WHEN HE GOT HOME FROM CAMP,
HE JUST WASN'T THE SAME.

10:01.401 --> 10:05.706
I COULDN'T EVEN DRAG HIM
TO CLINTON HOUSE.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.407
- SO WE TALKED
TO JOHNNY DUBCEK.

10:07.407 --> 10:10.310
HE ADMITTED ALL HE SAW
WAS COACH ALEXEI

10:10.310 --> 10:11.845
HELPING A STUDENT STRETCH.

10:11.845 --> 10:14.047
- ALL RIGHT,
SO HE OVERREACTED.

10:14.047 --> 10:17.084
DOES JOHNNY HAVE A HISTORY
OF BEING ASSAULTED?

10:17.084 --> 10:20.087
- MOM SAYS SOMETHING WENT ON
ONE SUMMER WITH A CAMP COACH.

10:20.087 --> 10:21.889
- OKAY,
SO WE'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE.

10:21.889 --> 10:24.057
SOMEBODY
SUFFERS A SEXUAL ABUSE,

10:24.057 --> 10:27.094
THEN THEY MANAGE TO FUNCTION
UNTIL THERE'S A TRIGGER.

10:27.094 --> 10:29.429
HE SEES COACH ALEXEI
TOUCH A BOY,

10:29.429 --> 10:31.164
AND IT SETS HIM OFF.

10:31.164 --> 10:33.701
- THEN HE'S CHAINED
TO A PEDOPHILE?

10:33.701 --> 10:35.669
YOU WANT TO SET OFF
PTSD IN SOMEONE,

10:35.669 --> 10:37.705
COULDN'T HAVE
PLANNED IT BETTER.

10:37.705 --> 10:39.907
- WELL, THAT'S ALL SOMETHING
HIS DEFENSE CAN BRING UP,

10:39.907 --> 10:41.842
AND I'LL MAKE SURE THE D.A.
PASSES THAT ALONG.

10:41.842 --> 10:43.443
- HOLD ON.
THAT'S IT?

10:43.443 --> 10:47.347
WHAT ABOUT THIS CAMP COACH?
- IT'S MARTIN SCHULTZ.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.717
HE WORKED
IN A CLINTON NEIGHBORHOOD HOUSE.

10:49.717 --> 10:51.384
IN THE SUMMERS,
HE RAN OPEN AIR CAMP.

10:51.384 --> 10:54.121
HE TOOK INNER-CITY KIDS
UP TO THE ADIRONDACKS.

10:54.121 --> 10:57.925
- DID DUBCEK ACCUSE HIM,
OR IS ALL OF THIS INFERENCE?

10:57.925 --> 11:00.694
- DUBCEK WAS PRETTY SHUT DOWN.
- SO THAT'S A NO.

11:00.694 --> 11:02.830
AND IF SCHULTZ HAD A RECORD,
YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD ME.

11:02.830 --> 11:05.432
- LIKE FATHER GEOGHAN
OR SANDUSKY?

11:05.432 --> 11:06.800
YOU KNOW HOW IT GOES.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.435
EVEN WHEN PEOPLE
TRY TO COME FORWARD,

11:08.435 --> 11:09.970
IT ALWAYS GETS HUSHED UP.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.139
- OR IT'S ALL JUST
A MISUNDERSTANDING,

11:12.139 --> 11:13.406
LIKE COACH ALEXEI.

11:13.406 --> 11:15.308
- OKAY, THIS SCHULTZ--

11:15.308 --> 11:18.411
LET'S AT LEAST SEE
IF HE'S STILL WORKING WITH KIDS.

11:19.947 --> 11:22.115
WE WANTED TO ASK YOU
ABOUT ONE OF YOUR OLD KIDS,

11:22.115 --> 11:25.185
JOHNNY DUBCEK.
- DUBCEK?

11:25.185 --> 11:27.320
I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH KIDS
FOR 50 YEARS NOW.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.156
I DON'T KNOW,
I--WHEN WAS THIS?

11:29.156 --> 11:30.724
- IT WAS THE EARLY '90s.

11:30.724 --> 11:32.459
YEAH, HIS DAD DIED
WHEN HE WAS TEN.

11:32.459 --> 11:33.894
YOU KNEW HIM
FROM CLINTON HOUSE.

11:33.894 --> 11:36.063
HE HAS BLUE EYES,
LIGHT BROWN HAIR.

11:36.063 --> 11:38.265
- OH, JOHNNY,
BIG METS FAN.

11:38.265 --> 11:41.068
HE USED TO WEAR
THIS RATTY, ORANGE T-SHIRT

11:41.068 --> 11:42.369
EVERY DAY TO CAMP.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.071
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

11:44.071 --> 11:48.041
THE OTHER KIDS TEASED HIM
SOMETHING FIERCE.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.443
YOU'RE COPS.
- MM-HMM.

11:50.443 --> 11:53.981
- YEAH, HE DO SOMETHING WRONG?
- HE ASSAULTED A COUPLE OF MEN.

11:53.981 --> 11:56.817
HE'S GOING AWAY
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

11:56.817 --> 11:59.452
- ANYTHING I CAN DO?
- WELL, WE'RE NOT SURE.

11:59.452 --> 12:02.155
WE'RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND
THE BOY WHO BECAME THE MAN.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.491
- OH, THAT'S ALWAYS
THE TOUGH ONE, ISN'T IT?

12:04.491 --> 12:07.160
HE COULD HAVE GONE
EITHER WAY.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.763
UH, THE KID HAD
A LOT OF POTENTIAL.

12:09.763 --> 12:10.998
- YEAH, HIS MOM
WAS TELLING US

12:10.998 --> 12:14.367
THAT HE WAS
A STRAIGHT-A STUDENT...

12:14.367 --> 12:15.803
TILL HE WENT TO CAMP HERE.

12:15.803 --> 12:19.406
- HEY, LISTEN,
YOU MIND GOING INSIDE?

12:19.406 --> 12:22.342
THIS COLD MAKES
MY JOINTS STIFF, HUH?

12:22.342 --> 12:24.845
COME ON IN.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.914
HOT CHOCOLATE.

12:26.914 --> 12:30.350
GOOD FOR THE SOUL.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.519
- SO BACK TO JOHNNY.
- MM-HMM.

12:32.519 --> 12:35.388
- DID HE EVER CONFIDE IN YOU
ABOUT SOMEBODY HERE AT THE CAMP

12:35.388 --> 12:37.490
ABUSING HIM?

12:37.490 --> 12:39.793
- STOP RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE.

12:42.062 --> 12:43.563
NOW, I KNOW THESE DAYS

12:43.563 --> 12:47.100
EVERYONE'S GONNA BE
ASKING THESE QUESTIONS.

12:47.100 --> 12:51.138
BUT I DON'T TOLERATE
DEVIANCE.

12:51.138 --> 12:54.007
AND IF I HAD SEEN
A COUNSELOR

12:54.007 --> 12:55.508
LOOK SIDEWAYS AT A KID,
I WOULD HAVE KNOCKED HIM

12:55.508 --> 12:56.877
ON HIS ASS
AND PUT HIM ON THE BUS

12:56.877 --> 12:59.412
BEFORE HE KNEW
WHAT HIT HIM.

12:59.412 --> 13:01.281
- WELL, I GET THAT,
MR. SCHULTZ.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.250
- CALL ME MARTIN.

13:03.250 --> 13:06.119
MR. SCHULTZ WAS MY FATHER.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.520
- DO ALL THE KIDS
CALL YOU MARTIN?

13:07.520 --> 13:09.522
- YEAH. THEY HAVE
ENOUGH AUTHORITY FIGURES

13:09.522 --> 13:10.891
IN THEIR LIVES.

13:10.891 --> 13:14.527
- SO YOU'RE THEIR FRIEND.

13:14.527 --> 13:18.498
- COUNSELOR, COACH.

13:18.498 --> 13:21.134
SURROGATE FATHER.

13:21.134 --> 13:24.071
I TRY TO CHANGE
THESE KIDS' LIVES.

13:24.071 --> 13:27.841
I WISH I COULD HAVE DONE MORE
FOR JOHNNY AND...

13:27.841 --> 13:31.611
SOME OF THE OTHER KIDS
I COULDN'T SAVE.

13:31.611 --> 13:36.116
FATHERLESS KIDS.

13:36.116 --> 13:38.385
TRY AS YOU MIGHT,
YOU CAN NEVER FILL THAT HOLE.

13:38.385 --> 13:41.088
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
DETECTIVE?

13:41.088 --> 13:43.223
- EXCUSE ME?

13:43.223 --> 13:45.893
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, HONEY.

13:45.893 --> 13:49.529
YOU'VE DONE GOOD.

13:49.529 --> 13:53.600
I MEAN, YOU COULD HAVE GONE
THE OTHER WAY TOO, HMM?

14:02.509 --> 14:04.878
- CAPTAIN,
HE'S A SOCIOPATH.

14:04.878 --> 14:06.613
HE'S GOT
THIS AVUNCULAR MANNER,

14:06.613 --> 14:08.648
AND HE SPENT THE WHOLE TIME
READING US.

14:08.648 --> 14:11.618
- AND YOU GOT ALL THIS
FROM A CUP OF HOT CHOCOLATE?

14:11.618 --> 14:14.187
- LOOK, EVERYTHING HE DOES
IS PREMEDITATED.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.655
EVERY WORD, EVERY LOOK.

14:15.655 --> 14:19.059
- SO YOU'RE TELLING ME
HE DIDN'T CONFESS?

14:19.059 --> 14:21.394
WELL, IF THIS GUY
HAS WORKED WITH KIDS

14:21.394 --> 14:24.164
FOR OVER 50 YEARS
AND THERE'S NOT ONE COMPLAINT--

14:24.164 --> 14:26.033
- BECAUSE HE KNOWS
WHO TO PICK.

14:26.033 --> 14:29.136
HE FINDS SINGLE MOTHERS
WHO ARE OVERBURDENED AT BEST,

14:29.136 --> 14:31.438
GRATEFUL THAT A MAN
HAS TAKEN INTEREST

14:31.438 --> 14:33.140
IN THEIR LOST BOYS.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.541
AND THERE MAY NOT BE
ANY COMPLAINTS,

14:34.541 --> 14:37.544
BUT THERE IS PLENTY
OF DAMAGE IN HIS WAKE.

14:37.544 --> 14:40.347
I MEAN, SO FAR I'VE FOUND
A DOZEN OF HIS KIDS

14:40.347 --> 14:43.483
NOW IN PRISON FOR ASSAULT,
FOR RAPE, MURDER.

14:43.483 --> 14:46.586
- BUT MOST SURVIVORS
DON'T BECOME ABUSERS.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.621
THEY'RE USUALLY
SHAMED INTO SILENCE.

14:48.621 --> 14:51.491
SO WHATEVER SCHULTZ DID
TO THOSE MEN

14:51.491 --> 14:55.929
WHEN THEY WERE BOYS...

14:55.929 --> 15:00.233
HE'S GROUND ZERO
FOR A SECOND GENERATION EPIDEMIC

15:00.233 --> 15:02.669
OF ASSAULT AND MURDER.

15:02.669 --> 15:04.671
- OKAY,
THIS ISN'T GONNA BE EASY.

15:04.671 --> 15:07.975
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND VICTIMS
WHO WILL COME FORWARD.

15:07.975 --> 15:10.443
- YOU'VE GOT A WHOLE BUNCH
RIGHT HERE, CAPTAIN.

15:10.443 --> 15:11.979
- CONVICTED FELONS.

15:11.979 --> 15:13.446
THEY'RE UNRELIABLE WITNESSES.

15:13.446 --> 15:15.082
- MAYBE INDIVIDUALLY,

15:15.082 --> 15:17.617
BUT THERE IS
A CLEAR PATTERN HERE.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.619
AND IF WE CAN PROVE
THAT ALL OF THESE VIOLENT MEN

15:19.619 --> 15:23.256
HAVE ONE ABUSER IN COMMON,
MARTIN SCHULTZ,

15:23.256 --> 15:25.158
WE'VE GOT A SHOT
AT TAKING HIM DOWN.

15:25.158 --> 15:27.427
- YEAH, BUT THE PROBLEM IS,
PRISONERS DON'T WANT TO ADMIT

15:27.427 --> 15:29.229
THEY WERE ABUSED.

15:29.229 --> 15:30.463
THEY DON'T WANT
TO BE LABELED AS VICTIMS.

15:30.463 --> 15:31.564
IT MAKES THEM TARGETS.

15:31.564 --> 15:34.601
- WE ONLY NEED ONE TO START.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.503
REGGIE RHODES, OKAY?

15:36.503 --> 15:38.238
AND HE'S NOT GONNA BE WORRIED
ABOUT BEING A TARGET

15:38.238 --> 15:41.241
BECAUSE HE'S ON DEATH ROW
IN OHIO.

15:41.241 --> 15:44.411
HE'S SENTENCED
TO DIE IN TEN DAYS.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.651
- YEAH, I KNEW JOHNNY.
FROM THE PROJECTS.

15:51.651 --> 15:53.320
- AND CAMP.

15:53.320 --> 15:56.523
MARTIN SCHULTZ?
CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT MARTIN?

15:56.523 --> 15:58.558
- NO, MA'AM,
I'D RATHER NOT.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.493
- WE UNDERSTAND THAT, REGGIE,
BUT HE'S STILL UP THERE

16:00.493 --> 16:02.462
AT THAT CAMP
WITH OTHER BOYS.

16:02.462 --> 16:05.298
- WHY DO THEY CARE NOW?
THEY NEVER CARED BEFORE.

16:05.298 --> 16:08.068
- BECAUSE WE'RE
JUST FINDING OUT NOW...

16:08.068 --> 16:10.003
ABOUT WHAT HE DID
TO THOSE BOYS.

16:10.003 --> 16:13.073
AND IF THAT MAN IS GOING
TO BE PUNISHED FOR WHAT HE DID,

16:13.073 --> 16:16.643
THEN WE NEED SOMEBODY
BRAVE ENOUGH TO COME FORWARD.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.678
- I CAN'T.

16:18.678 --> 16:20.480
I DON'T WANT
TO THINK ABOUT HIM.

16:20.480 --> 16:24.051
I DON'T WANT
TO THINK ABOUT ANY OF THEM.

16:24.051 --> 16:27.020
- THEM?
- THE MAN YOU MURDERED.

16:27.020 --> 16:30.123
AT TRIAL, THEY SAID
HE WAS A STRANGER.

16:30.123 --> 16:32.425
YOU WERE JUST ROBBING HIM
IN HIS HOUSE.

16:32.425 --> 16:37.230
IS THERE MORE
TO IT THAN THAT?

16:39.799 --> 16:43.603
- DOESN'T MATTER.
I DID KILL HIM.

16:43.603 --> 16:47.074
AND I CAN'T
TAKE THAT BACK.

16:47.074 --> 16:49.376
I'M TRYING TO STAY
AT PEACE.

16:49.376 --> 16:53.012
NOW GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE NOW!

17:04.324 --> 17:05.725
- SO HOW DOES THIS
CROSS YOUR DESK?

17:05.725 --> 17:07.827
- BECAUSE WE ARE TRACKING
A CAREER PEDOPHILE,

17:07.827 --> 17:10.597
MARTIN SCHULTZ,
AND WE BELIEVE THAT REGGIE

17:10.597 --> 17:13.300
IS ONE OF A DOZEN VICTIMS
WHO WENT ON

17:13.300 --> 17:15.468
TO COMMIT VIOLENT CRIMES
THEMSELVES.

17:15.468 --> 17:18.105
- SO ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT A DEATH PENALTY CASE HERE

17:18.105 --> 17:19.739
OR ME DOING SVU'S JOB?

17:19.739 --> 17:21.608
- A LITTLE OF BOTH.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.643
- SO YOU'RE ASKING ME
FOR A FAVOR.

17:23.643 --> 17:27.780
SO...YOU'RE NOT ANGRY
WITH ME ANYMORE?

17:29.249 --> 17:31.551
- I WAS NEVER ANGRY.
- NO?

17:31.551 --> 17:33.320
YOU HAD A RIGHT TO BE.

17:33.320 --> 17:37.524
I BLEW UP YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH DAVID HADEN.

17:37.524 --> 17:40.327
- OKAY, I WAS ANGRY.

17:40.327 --> 17:43.396
BUT I ALSO KNEW YOU THAT YOU
WERE DOING RIGHT BY YOUR CLIENT.

17:46.433 --> 17:50.370
BAYARD, JUST TAKE A LOOK
AT REGGIE'S CASE.

17:50.370 --> 17:51.771
OKAY?
THE D.A. SAID

17:51.771 --> 17:55.775
THAT THIS WAS A ROBBERY
GONE BAD, BUT NOTHING WAS TAKEN,

17:55.775 --> 17:59.546
AND THE MAN THAT HE MURDERED
HAD TWO PRIOR SOLICITATIONS

17:59.546 --> 18:03.650
FOR YOUNG BLACK MEN.

18:03.650 --> 18:08.355
- AND THIS NEVER
CAME OUT AT TRIAL?

18:08.355 --> 18:11.358
AND REGGIE NEVER REFERENCED
A SEXUAL RELATIONSHIP?

18:11.358 --> 18:15.562
- PROBABLY TOO ASHAMED
TO ADMIT IT.

18:16.896 --> 18:21.401
IF WE DON'T HELP HIM,
HE DIES IN NINE DAYS.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.408
- SO IF I TALK TO YOU,

18:28.408 --> 18:31.344
MR. ELLIS WILL HELP
WITH MY DEFENSE?

18:31.344 --> 18:33.446
- I READ THE TRANSCRIPT
OF YOUR TWO-DAY TRIAL.

18:33.446 --> 18:34.847
I'LL HELP EITHER WAY.

18:34.847 --> 18:38.318
- BUT MY LAST LAST ATTORNEY,
MR. AMIRI,

18:38.318 --> 18:39.919
HE SAID IT WAS TOO LATE.
- IT'S NOT.

18:39.919 --> 18:41.421
THE GOVERNOR
CAN GRANT CLEMENCY

18:41.421 --> 18:43.290
IF THE PAROLE BOARD
RECOMMENDS IT.

18:43.290 --> 18:44.624
DID MR. AMIRI
EVER TELL YOU THAT?

18:44.624 --> 18:47.694
- I TALKED TO HIM SO LONG AGO,
I DON'T RECALL.

18:47.694 --> 18:49.496
I'D LIKE TO TALK
TO THE GOVERNOR,

18:49.496 --> 18:50.930
IF THAT'S POSSIBLE.

18:50.930 --> 18:53.900
- IT WOULD BE MORE LIKE
MR. ELLIS WOULD SPEAK FOR YOU

18:53.900 --> 18:56.569
TO THE PAROLE BOARD.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.538
- ABOUT WHAT?
- REGGIE, YOU MURDERED A MAN.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.907
AND YOU MAY NEVER
GET OUT OF PRISON.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.909
BUT IF SOMETHING
HAPPENED TO YOU,

19:02.909 --> 19:05.378
SOMETHING BAD
WHEN YOU WERE A KID,

19:05.378 --> 19:08.248
THE JURY SHOULD
HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT.

19:08.248 --> 19:12.252
- REGGIE,
BEFORE THE TRIAL,

19:12.252 --> 19:15.922
DID ANYBODY EVER ASK YOU
ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD?

19:15.922 --> 19:18.458
ANYBODY EVER ASK YOU
ABOUT THAT CAMP?

19:18.458 --> 19:20.393
- I MET THE LAWYER
A DAY BEFORE.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.362
WE DIDN'T TALK MUCH
ABOUT ANYTHING.

19:22.362 --> 19:25.765
- THERE'S STILL TIME.
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.

19:25.765 --> 19:29.602
WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT NOW,
OKAY?

19:31.404 --> 19:33.540
REGGIE,
WE NEED YOU TO TELL US

19:33.540 --> 19:36.709
WHAT HAPPENED
AT MARTIN'S CAMP.

19:36.709 --> 19:38.578
- THE SOCIAL WORKER IN THE GROUP
USED TO ALWAYS TRY

19:38.578 --> 19:41.348
TO GET ME
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

19:41.348 --> 19:43.616
- I KNOW IT'S DIFFICULT,
REGGIE.

19:43.616 --> 19:46.453
BUT THE PAROLE BOARD HAS
TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

19:46.453 --> 19:51.491
- IT'S TOO LATE.
I'M LETTING IT GO.

19:51.491 --> 19:52.792
I FORGIVE EVERYONE
FOR EVERYTHING.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.661
I EVEN FORGIVE MY MAMA.

19:54.661 --> 19:57.297
- FORGIVE HER FOR WHAT?

19:57.297 --> 20:01.368
- FOR SENDING ME BACK
TO MARTIN'S CAMP.

20:05.338 --> 20:06.806
- DOES HE HAVE A CHANCE?
[buzzer]

20:06.806 --> 20:08.575
- AFTER THE DEFENSE HE HAD,

20:08.575 --> 20:11.411
IF OHIO EXECUTES HIM,
IT'S STATE-SANCTIONED MURDER.

20:11.411 --> 20:13.480
YOU HAVE ANY VACATION DAYS
ACCUMULATED?

20:13.480 --> 20:16.416
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.
50, 60 WEEKS.

20:16.416 --> 20:17.917
- WELL, GOOD,
YOU'RE IN LUCK.

20:17.917 --> 20:20.487
CLEVELAND'S LOVELY
THIS TIME OF YEAR.

20:20.487 --> 20:22.689
AND I'M GOING
TO NEED YOUR HELP.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.627
- RHODES...

20:27.627 --> 20:29.529
REGGIE RHODES.

20:29.529 --> 20:30.830
- HE'S ONE
OF YOUR DEATH ROW CLIENTS.

20:30.830 --> 20:31.831
- FOUND GUILTY OF KILLING
CHARLES DANFORTH,

20:31.831 --> 20:33.533
FATHER OF THREE.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.502
REPEATEDLY SMASHED HIS HEAD
AGAINST A STOVE.

20:35.502 --> 20:38.605
JURY WAS OUT 40 MINUTES.
WHAT IS IT I CAN DO FOR YOU?

20:38.605 --> 20:40.940
- YOU'VE YET TO GO TO THE PAROLE
BOARD TO ASK FOR CLEMENCY.

20:40.940 --> 20:43.310
- RHODES WAS THE ONLY WITNESS
FOR THE DEFENSE.

20:43.310 --> 20:45.512
HE LIED ON THE STAND,
SAID HE WASN'T AT THE SCENE.

20:45.512 --> 20:48.047
THE VICTIM'S BLOOD
WAS FOUND ON HIS SHOES.

20:48.047 --> 20:50.350
AND FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
HE TOLD ME HE DID IT.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.984
- DID HE ALSO TELL YOU
THAT HE MET

20:51.984 --> 20:53.386
HIS ORIGINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY
THE DAY BEFORE THE TRIAL

20:53.386 --> 20:55.388
AND THAT LAWYER
WAS SUBSEQUENTLY DISBARRED?

20:55.388 --> 20:58.658
- A DEFENDANT IS
ONLY ENTITLED TO COUNSEL,

20:58.658 --> 21:01.494
NOT QUALITY OF COUNSEL.

21:01.494 --> 21:04.364
- MR. AMIRI,
WE'VE ALSO BECOME AWARE

21:04.364 --> 21:06.533
THAT MR. RHODES
WAS A VICTIM

21:06.533 --> 21:08.568
OF SEXUAL ABUSE
AS A CHILD.

21:08.568 --> 21:10.370
- I'M SURE IT'S TRUE
FOR HALF OF MY CASES.

21:10.370 --> 21:11.971
BUT THE GOVERNOR
DOESN'T PARDON MURDERERS

21:11.971 --> 21:13.806
'CAUSE THEY HAD
A BAD CHILDHOOD.

21:13.806 --> 21:16.443
- LOOK, IT TOOK ME 15 MINUTES
TO FIND OUT THAT THE DECEASED

21:16.443 --> 21:18.411
HAD A RECORD FOR SOLICITATION
OF YOUNG MEN.

21:18.411 --> 21:20.680
I NEED TO PROVE
THAT THE ORIGINAL DEFENSE LAWYER

21:20.680 --> 21:23.516
NEGLECTED TO TELL THE JURY
ABOUT MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES,

21:23.516 --> 21:24.817
PERIOD.

21:24.817 --> 21:27.787
- MR. ELLIS,
WHAT WE DO IS TRIAGE.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.889
I'VE GOT PEOPLE ON DEATH ROW
FOR CRIMES THEY DIDN'T COMMIT.

21:29.889 --> 21:32.392
YOU THINK YOU CAN COME IN
AND DO A BETTER JOB,

21:32.392 --> 21:33.693
HAVE AT IT.

21:33.693 --> 21:37.029
- THANK YOU.

21:37.029 --> 21:40.032
THAT'S ALL
I WANTED TO HEAR.

21:42.902 --> 21:44.571
REGGIE, WE NEED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED

21:44.571 --> 21:46.038
THAT NIGHT
AT CHARLES DANFORTH'S HOUSE.

21:46.038 --> 21:48.408
- I CAN'T GO BACK
TO THAT PLACE, MAN.

21:48.408 --> 21:50.810
- THE JURY WAS TOLD THAT YOU
HAD NEVER MET DANFORTH BEFORE.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.745
AND THAT NIGHT,

21:52.745 --> 21:55.482
HE JUST HAPPENED TO HIRE YOU
FOR AN ODD JOB?

21:55.482 --> 21:58.918
- REGGIE, WE KNOW
THAT HE HIRED OTHER YOUNG MEN,

21:58.918 --> 22:01.854
AND IT WASN'T
FOR ODD JOBS.

22:03.756 --> 22:07.560
HOW DID YOU END UP
IN HIS HOME?

22:07.560 --> 22:10.096
- REGGIE, YOU'VE GOT
TO HELP YOURSELF HERE.

22:10.096 --> 22:12.899
- WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?
IT'S OVER.

22:12.899 --> 22:14.901
- THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN TELL THIS WOMAN

22:14.901 --> 22:17.036
THAT SHE HASN'T HEARD.

22:17.036 --> 22:19.439
THERE'S NOTHING YOU COULD SAY
THAT WOULD MAKE YOU

22:19.439 --> 22:23.643
ANY LESS OF A MAN
IN MY EYES.

22:26.979 --> 22:30.683
WHY DON'T I GIVE YOU AND
MS. BENSON SOME TIME TOGETHER?

22:34.787 --> 22:37.490
- YOU NEED A BREAK?
HOW ABOUT SOME WATER?

22:37.490 --> 22:41.494
- NO, THANK YOU, MA'AM.

22:41.494 --> 22:43.430
- REGGIE, YOU SAID BEFORE
THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT TO TALK

22:43.430 --> 22:44.831
ABOUT ANY OF THEM.

22:44.831 --> 22:47.967
MARTIN...

22:47.967 --> 22:52.171
HE WASN'T THE FIRST.

22:52.171 --> 22:55.708
HOW OLD WERE YOU
WHEN IT STARTED?

23:01.548 --> 23:05.485
- WELL, THE FIRST TIME
I CAN REMEMBER...

23:05.485 --> 23:09.388
FIVE, MAYBE SIX.

23:13.493 --> 23:15.562
SEE, MY UNCLE...

23:15.562 --> 23:19.566
MY UNCLE
PUT HIS MOUTH ON ME.

23:19.566 --> 23:22.735
AND HE SAID, UM,

23:22.735 --> 23:25.137
"NOW YOU'RE A BIG BOY,

23:25.137 --> 23:28.641
AND THIS IS WHAT BIG BOYS
DO WITH MEN."

23:31.511 --> 23:35.482
- AFTER HIS UNCLE, IT WAS
HIS MOTHER'S BOYFRIEND, OR PIMP.

23:35.482 --> 23:38.785
AND AT TEN,
IT WAS A TEACHER IN SCHOOL.

23:38.785 --> 23:40.853
I MEAN,
PREDATORS HAVE RADAR.

23:40.853 --> 23:42.589
- AND SCHULTZ?
- THREE SUMMERS.

23:42.589 --> 23:45.958
AND BY THE END, SCHULTZ WAS
PASSING HIM AROUND TO OTHER MEN.

23:45.958 --> 23:47.694
SO REGGIE DROPS
OUT OF SCHOOL,

23:47.694 --> 23:50.096
HE HITCHHIKES,
AND ENDS UP HERE IN CLEVELAND.

23:50.096 --> 23:52.699
- WHERE HE MEETS DANFORTH?
- THROUGH A MUTUAL FRIEND.

23:52.699 --> 23:55.502
DANFORTH PAYS HIM FOR SEX
FOR OVER A YEAR.

23:55.502 --> 23:56.703
- THE "ODD JOBS."

23:56.703 --> 23:58.605
- UNTIL ONE NIGHT,
REGGIE COMES OVER.

23:58.605 --> 24:00.873
AFTER DANFORTH
IS FINISHED WITH HIM,

24:00.873 --> 24:04.043
THE DOOR OPENS,
AND THREE OTHER MEN

24:04.043 --> 24:06.779
WALK INTO THE GARAGE.

24:06.779 --> 24:09.582
THEY WORK HIM OVER
ALL NIGHT.

24:09.582 --> 24:11.183
THE NEXT DAY,
REGGIE COMES BACK

24:11.183 --> 24:13.219
AND KILLS DANFORTH.

24:13.219 --> 24:15.955
- DID HE EVER TELL
HIS ORIGINAL LAWYER THAT STORY?

24:15.955 --> 24:17.256
- HE SAYS
THAT THE LAWYER TOLD HIM

24:17.256 --> 24:19.559
THAT THE JURY
DIDN'T NEED TO HEAR THAT.

24:19.559 --> 24:22.862
HE SAID IT WAS BETTER TO SAY
THAT HE WASN'T THERE AT ALL.

24:24.597 --> 24:26.599
- THAT LAWYER'S DECEASED.

24:26.599 --> 24:28.568
BUT THE PAROLE BOARD'S
GONNA WANT CONFIRMATION,

24:28.568 --> 24:29.802
SO WE'RE
ON TWO TRACKS NOW.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.270
REGGIE'S RELATIONSHIP
WITH DANFORTH--

24:31.270 --> 24:34.741
- AND WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM
GROWING UP.

24:37.209 --> 24:40.112
- MY UNCLE ABUSED ME FIRST.

24:40.112 --> 24:44.150
UNTIL I--YOU KNOW...

24:44.150 --> 24:46.553
- YEAH, I KNOW.

24:46.553 --> 24:48.655
AFTER YOU MATURED,
HE MOVED ON TO REGGIE.

24:48.655 --> 24:51.658
- I WAS JUST GLAD
IT WASN'T ME ANYMORE.

24:51.658 --> 24:53.626
I WOULD STAY AT THE LIBRARY
UNTIL CLOSE

24:53.626 --> 24:56.128
AND JUST BURY
MY HEAD IN MY BOOKS.

24:56.128 --> 24:59.832
- BUT YOU'RE LUCKY YOU GOT OUT.
YOUR BROTHER'S ON DEATH ROW.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.601
- I PRAY FOR HIM
EVERY DAY.

25:01.601 --> 25:03.536
- 'CAUSE YOU KNOW
WHAT HE WENT THROUGH...

25:03.536 --> 25:07.306
THAT IT WAS MORE
THAN JUST YOUR UNCLE.

25:07.306 --> 25:09.275
- I KNOW.

25:09.275 --> 25:13.580
- KASSANDRA, YOU COULDN'T
PROTECT HIM GROWING UP.

25:13.580 --> 25:17.784
HELP HIM NOW.

25:17.784 --> 25:19.619
- REGGIE...
REGGIE RHODES?

25:19.619 --> 25:21.120
GOOD GOD ALMIGHTY.

25:21.120 --> 25:22.555
WHEN HE SHOWED UP
AT THIS CAMP,

25:22.555 --> 25:24.323
HE DIDN'T EVEN
HAVE A TOOTHBRUSH.

25:24.323 --> 25:26.225
A PAIR OF SHORTS,

25:26.225 --> 25:27.960
A PAIR OF OLD,
HIGH-TOP, DIRTY SNEAKERS.

25:27.960 --> 25:31.964
HIS MOTHER
WAS A CRACK ADDICT, OR WORSE.

25:31.964 --> 25:33.666
- ANYTHING ELSE
YOU REMEMBER ABOUT HIM?

25:33.666 --> 25:35.902
- A 12-YEAR-OLD KID
WITH A RAP SHEET

25:35.902 --> 25:37.236
AS LONG AS YOUR ARM.

25:37.236 --> 25:39.338
BUT UNDERNEATH,
HE'S A SWEET KID.

25:39.338 --> 25:41.007
SWEET KID.

25:41.007 --> 25:45.277
UNTIL HE FOUND ME,
NOBODY EVER LOOKED OUT FOR HIM.

25:45.277 --> 25:47.013
- ANYTHING MORE, MARTIN?

25:47.013 --> 25:49.348
- NO, PABLO, YOU GOT HOMEWORK
FOR TOMORROW, RIGHT?

25:49.348 --> 25:53.786
WELL, GET UPSTAIRS
AND GET GOING.

25:53.786 --> 25:56.889
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS WERE WORKING
ON THE JOHNNY DUBCEK CASE.

25:56.889 --> 26:00.727
- YEAH, THE BOYS, THEY BOTH
WENT TO SETTLEMENT HOUSE

26:00.727 --> 26:02.061
AND YOUR CAMP.

26:02.061 --> 26:03.730
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

26:03.730 --> 26:07.767
WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO
WITH THE PRICE OF COFFEE?

26:07.767 --> 26:10.236
ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY
THIS CAMP HAD SOMETHING TO DO

26:10.236 --> 26:12.104
WITH THOSE BOYS' BEHAVIOR?

26:12.104 --> 26:15.207
- REGGIE RHODES TOLD DETECTIVES
THAT HE WAS RAPED

26:15.207 --> 26:17.610
HERE AT THIS CAMP,
THREE SUMMERS IN A ROW.

26:17.610 --> 26:20.379
- YEAH, THE GUY BASHES
SOMEONE'S HEAD IN.

26:20.379 --> 26:22.682
HE'S ABOUT TO GET
THE NEEDLE FOR IT.

26:22.682 --> 26:25.952
NATURALLY, HE'S GOING TO LOOK
FOR SOME WAY TO SAVE HIS HIDE.

26:25.952 --> 26:29.021
- MARTIN, NO ONE'S
SAYING IT WAS YOU,

26:29.021 --> 26:31.057
BUT YOU TOLD US,
ANY WHIFF OF TROUBLE,

26:31.057 --> 26:32.759
AND YOU'D KICK
THE COUNSELOR OUT.

26:32.759 --> 26:36.162
SO ANYTHING HAPPEN
WHILE REGGIE WAS HERE?

26:36.162 --> 26:39.165
- YOU WANT ME TO LIE?

26:39.165 --> 26:41.400
- IT'S PAST THE STATUTE
OF LIMITATIONS.

26:41.400 --> 26:46.038
SO THIS CAMP, YOU...

26:46.038 --> 26:49.275
YOU KNOW, WE COULD ENSURE
THERE'D BE NO LIABILITY.

26:55.247 --> 26:57.750
- GET THE HELL
OUT OF HERE!

26:57.750 --> 27:00.687
I DON'T WANT THAT BOY UPSTAIRS
TO HEAR ANY OF THIS!

27:00.687 --> 27:01.788
GO ON!

27:01.788 --> 27:05.391
GET OUT!

27:17.069 --> 27:18.404
- MS. LATHROP, YOU WERE
THE ASSISTANT PROSECUTOR

27:18.404 --> 27:19.872
IN THE CASE
AGAINST REGGIE RHODES?

27:19.872 --> 27:21.307
- IT WAS MY FIRST MURDER TRIAL
AS LEAD COUNSEL.

27:21.307 --> 27:23.342
- SO YOU HAD A LOT
RIDING ON THIS CASE.

27:23.342 --> 27:25.912
- FRANKLY, IT WAS A GOOD ONE
TO CUT MY TEETH ON.

27:25.912 --> 27:27.446
AND I WAS SUPERVISED

27:27.446 --> 27:29.749
BY THE LEAD PROSECUTOR,
JIM HARRISON.

27:29.749 --> 27:31.818
YOU'RE PREPARING
RHODES'S CLEMENCY HEARING?

27:31.818 --> 27:34.453
- MM-HMM. AND WE FOUND
MITIGATING CIRCUMSTANCES

27:34.453 --> 27:36.388
THAT WE THINK THE JURY
SHOULD HAVE HEARD.

27:36.388 --> 27:38.290
- LIKE WHAT?
IT WAS OPEN AND SHUT.

27:38.290 --> 27:39.959
- WELL, FOR ONE,
THAT DANFORTH

27:39.959 --> 27:42.394
MAY HAVE BEEN PAYING RHODES
FOR SEX.

27:42.394 --> 27:43.429
- IS THAT WHAT
HE'S TELLING YOU NOW?

27:43.429 --> 27:45.097
EVERYBODY HAS A STORY.

27:45.097 --> 27:46.432
- WELL, WE THINK REGGIE
MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABUSED

27:46.432 --> 27:48.034
THE NIGHT
BEFORE HE KILLED DANFORTH.

27:48.034 --> 27:49.468
IF YOU HAVE ANY WAY
TO CORROBORATE THAT--

27:49.468 --> 27:51.103
- I DON'T.
- WELL, YOU DO KNOW

27:51.103 --> 27:53.940
THAT DANFORTH HAD A RECORD
FOR SOLICITATION.

27:53.940 --> 27:57.777
- THAT WAS PUBLIC INFORMATION.
- SO THE DEFENSE KNEW ABOUT IT?

27:57.777 --> 27:58.878
- OF COURSE.
I WAS PREPARED

27:58.878 --> 28:02.048
FOR HIM TO BRING IT UP.
HE NEVER DID.

28:04.216 --> 28:06.819
THERE ARE PEOPLE ON DEATH ROW
THAT DESERVE CLEMENCY,

28:06.819 --> 28:10.890
BUT REGGIE RHODES--
HE DESERVES TO DIE.

28:13.425 --> 28:15.227
- SHE SEEM
A BIT DEFENSIVE TO YOU?

28:15.227 --> 28:16.996
- I THINK
SHE WAS HELPFUL.

28:16.996 --> 28:18.798
SHE TOLD US THAT REGGIE'S LAWYER
KNEW DANFORTH HAD A RECORD

28:18.798 --> 28:20.266
AND DIDN'T USE IT.

28:20.266 --> 28:21.801
THAT SPEAKS OF NEGLIGENCE.

28:21.801 --> 28:25.171
- IS THAT ENOUGH?

28:28.274 --> 28:31.177
- THE FIRST SUMMER
REGGIE CAME HOME FROM CAMP,

28:31.177 --> 28:33.279
I WAS HELPING
WITH HIS LAUNDRY,

28:33.279 --> 28:37.483
AND HIS...

28:37.483 --> 28:39.118
[sighs]

28:39.118 --> 28:41.520
HIS UNDERWEAR
WAS STAINED WITH BLOOD.

28:41.520 --> 28:46.492
MAMA SAW IT,
AND SHE DIDN'T EVEN SAY A WORD.

28:46.492 --> 28:48.460
SHE JUST PUT IT
IN THE WASH.

28:48.460 --> 28:50.296
- AND WHEN WAS THIS?
- REGGIE WAS 13.

28:50.296 --> 28:52.765
I WAS 17,
HOME VISITING.

28:52.765 --> 28:54.000
- AND YOU WEREN'T LIVING
WITH YOUR MOTHER?

28:54.000 --> 28:57.303
- NOT AT THAT TIME.
I FELT SORRY FOR REGGIE.

28:57.303 --> 28:59.305
BUT MAMA WAS USING,

28:59.305 --> 29:01.874
AND I COULDN'T FIGHT HER
AND HER BOYFRIEND.

29:01.874 --> 29:04.977
- DID YOU TELL REGGIE'S
DEFENSE LAWYER ABOUT THIS?

29:04.977 --> 29:06.445
- YEAH, I CALLED HIM
OUTSIDE THE COURTHOUSE.

29:06.445 --> 29:09.448
AND BEFORE I COULD
GET TEN WORDS IN,

29:09.448 --> 29:12.484
HE TOLD ME
TO SHUT THE "F" UP,

29:12.484 --> 29:15.487
THAT THE JURY
DID NOT NEED TO KNOW

29:15.487 --> 29:17.489
THAT REGGIE WAS A HOMO.

29:17.489 --> 29:19.291
- THANK YOU, MS. SMITH.

29:19.291 --> 29:23.062
- MR. ELLIS, THIS HISTORY
OF ABUSE IS HORRIBLE.

29:23.062 --> 29:24.864
AND THE FACT THAT
MR. RHODES'S ORIGINAL COUNSELOR

29:24.864 --> 29:27.466
NEVER BROUGHT IT
TO THE ATTENTION OF THE JURY

29:27.466 --> 29:29.035
ONLY COMPOUNDS
THE NEGLIGENCE.

29:29.035 --> 29:30.302
- WELL, THANK YOU,
MS. BROOKS.

29:30.302 --> 29:32.338
HERE ARE
OUR SWORN AFFIDAVITS

29:32.338 --> 29:34.040
FROM SEVEN
OF THE ORIGINAL JURORS,

29:34.040 --> 29:36.175
STATING THAT,
HAD THEY KNOWN THIS HISTORY,

29:36.175 --> 29:39.211
THEY WOULD NOT HAVE SENTENCED
REGGIE RHODES TO DEATH.

29:39.211 --> 29:40.546
- EVEN THOUGH YOUR CLIENT
NOW ADMITS TO THE MURDER

29:40.546 --> 29:42.348
HE PREVIOUSLY DENIED?

29:42.348 --> 29:44.383
- OH, YES, THEY ALL AGREED THAT,
GIVEN THIS LEVEL

29:44.383 --> 29:45.852
OF DEFENSE NEGLIGENCE,
IT WOULD BE

29:45.852 --> 29:47.486
A GRAVE MISCARRIAGE
OF JUSTICE

29:47.486 --> 29:50.156
FOR THE STATE
TO EXECUTE REGGIE RHODES.

29:50.156 --> 29:53.325
- THANK YOU, COUNSELOR.
WE WILL RULE WITHIN 24 HOURS.

29:53.325 --> 29:56.162
THIS CONCLUDES
THE HEARING.

29:56.162 --> 29:57.830
- GOOD JOB, ELLIS.

29:57.830 --> 29:59.398
YOU BROUGHT UP ENOUGH
TO GET THE CASE RETRIED.

29:59.398 --> 30:01.167
- WELL, ONE STEP AT A TIME.

30:01.167 --> 30:03.602
LET'S JUST FOCUS
ON THE STAY OF EXECUTION.

30:03.602 --> 30:06.839
- WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

30:06.839 --> 30:09.876
- WE WAIT, REGGIE.

30:15.547 --> 30:18.517
- HEY, YOU'RE BOTH HERE.
THAT MUST MEAN GOOD NEWS.

30:18.517 --> 30:24.090
- THEY VOTED FIVE TO FOUR
AGAINST US.

30:24.090 --> 30:25.591
- I'M SORRY, REGGIE.

30:25.591 --> 30:28.360
- BUT I THOUGHT--
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

30:28.360 --> 30:29.528
- I DON'T KNOW, REGGIE,

30:29.528 --> 30:32.831
BUT WE'RE GONNA TRY
AND FIND OUT.

30:34.566 --> 30:37.870
- MM.

30:39.371 --> 30:42.074
- THE PAROLE BOARD
SAYS IN THEIR OWN DECISION

30:42.074 --> 30:44.911
THAT REGGIE'S DEFENSE WAS
UNCONSTITUTIONALLY DEFICIENT.

30:44.911 --> 30:47.146
THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.
- KEEP READING.

30:47.146 --> 30:49.648
- AND THEN THEY VOTE
FIVE TO FOUR,

30:49.648 --> 30:51.984
"THAT THE NEGLIGENT DEFENSE
DOESN'T RISE TO THE LEVEL

30:51.984 --> 30:55.087
OF INVALIDATING THE SANCTITY
OF A JURY'S DECISION."

30:55.087 --> 30:56.923
WHAT AM I MISSING?

30:56.923 --> 30:59.959
- FOUR VOTES.
NO OFFENSE, EX-COPS. C.O.s.

30:59.959 --> 31:03.395
- I SAW THEM ROLLING THEIR EYES
WHEN THE SISTER WAS TESTIFYING.

31:03.395 --> 31:06.933
BUT THE FIFTH VOTE,
THE CHAIR.

31:06.933 --> 31:08.367
SHE WAS ASKING
ALL THE RIGHT QUESTIONS.

31:08.367 --> 31:09.668
- OH, YES, SHE DID,

31:09.668 --> 31:12.204
WHICH MAKES IT HARDER
TO ACCUSE HER OF BIAS.

31:12.204 --> 31:13.572
- BIAS?

31:13.572 --> 31:15.975
SHE'S THE FORMER HEAD
OF SOCIAL SERVICES.

31:15.975 --> 31:17.944
- SHE ALSO SHOULD
HAVE RECUSED HERSELF.

31:17.944 --> 31:20.212
I GOT AN OFF-THE-RECORD CALL
THIS MORNING.

31:20.212 --> 31:23.382
MS. BROOKS IS MARRIED
TO JIM HARRISON.

31:25.484 --> 31:28.120
- THE LEAD PROSECUTOR

31:28.120 --> 31:30.222
WHO SUPERVISED
D.A. LATHROP

31:30.222 --> 31:35.327
AS SHE "CUT HER TEETH"
ON REGGIE'S TRIAL.

31:35.327 --> 31:39.165
OH, MY GOD.

31:39.165 --> 31:40.632
THIS WAS RIGGED.

31:40.632 --> 31:43.602
- IT'S BEEN RIGGED
AGAINST REGGIE FROM THE GET.

31:43.602 --> 31:45.171
- SO THAT'S IT?

31:45.171 --> 31:49.108
- NO, THERE MAY BE
JUST ONE LAST SHOT.

31:56.282 --> 31:58.184
- PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT?

31:58.184 --> 32:01.387
PROSECUTORS MAKE MISTAKES,
CAN BE NEGLIGENT.

32:01.387 --> 32:03.322
BUT IN THIS CASE,
YOU'RE ALLEGING

32:03.322 --> 32:06.058
THAT THEY INTENTIONALLY
WITHHELD EVIDENCE?

32:06.058 --> 32:07.659
- YES, IF THE PROSECUTORS
KNEW ABOUT REGGIE'S ABUSE

32:07.659 --> 32:09.561
AND HID THAT
FROM THE DEFENSE,

32:09.561 --> 32:11.663
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.

32:11.663 --> 32:13.365
- 20 YEARS,
AND IT'S NEVER COME OUT?

32:13.365 --> 32:15.534
RHODES IS SENTENCED
TO DIE IN FIVE DAYS.

32:15.534 --> 32:17.736
FORGIVE ME, COUNSELOR,

32:17.736 --> 32:20.672
BUT ISN'T THIS THE DEFINITION
OF A HAIL MARY?

32:20.672 --> 32:22.608
- AND AS THE PAROLE BOARD
JUST AFFIRMED,

32:22.608 --> 32:26.612
THE DEFENSE WAS
UNCONSTITUTIONALLY INCOMPETENT.

32:26.612 --> 32:28.580
- I WON'T GRANT
A STAY OF EXECUTION.

32:28.580 --> 32:30.482
YOU CAN HAVE THE FILES...

32:30.482 --> 32:32.551
TILL NOON TOMORROW.

32:32.551 --> 32:34.486
- YOUR HONOR, IT'S 5:00 P.M.
THAT'S LESS THAN 24 HOURS.

32:34.486 --> 32:37.556
- YOUR CLIENT
HAS HAD 20 YEARS.

32:37.556 --> 32:39.625
TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT.

32:39.625 --> 32:42.961
- YES.
THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.

32:46.232 --> 32:47.766
- BAYARD, LOOK AT THIS.

32:47.766 --> 32:50.202
LOOK AT THIS.

32:50.202 --> 32:52.704
THESE ARE THE CRIME SCENE PHOTOS
THAT WERE SHOWN TO THE JURY.

32:52.704 --> 32:56.108
THESE I JUST FOUND.
THEY'RE WIDER SHOTS.

32:56.108 --> 33:00.612
LOOK AT THE BLOODY FOOTPRINTS,
AND LOOK AT THE BARE SPOT.

33:00.612 --> 33:03.082
IT'S MISSING
EVIDENCE SHADOWS.

33:03.082 --> 33:04.550
THEY SANITIZED
THE CRIME SCENE.

33:04.550 --> 33:07.153
- I'LL KEEP GOING,
YOU GO SEE IF REGGIE REMEMBERS

33:07.153 --> 33:09.588
WHAT WAS ON THE FLOOR.

33:09.588 --> 33:11.390
- YEAH,
DANFORTH TOOK PICTURES.

33:11.390 --> 33:13.525
THAT'S WHY I WENT BACK
THE NEXT DAY TO TELL HIM

33:13.525 --> 33:15.327
TO GIVE THEM BACK.

33:15.327 --> 33:18.497
- SO THE MEN TOOK POLAROIDS
THE NIGHT THEY WORKED YOU OVER?

33:18.497 --> 33:20.166
- YOU KNOW,
I HEARD CLICKS.

33:20.166 --> 33:22.168
I SEEN FLASHES.

33:22.168 --> 33:24.170
I SAID, "STOP IT."

33:24.170 --> 33:26.538
I SAID,
"NO MORE PICTURES."

33:26.538 --> 33:30.142
THEN I WENT BACK TO DANFORTH.
I TRIED TO GRAB THEM FROM HIM.

33:30.142 --> 33:31.643
THEY FELL
ALL OVER THE FLOOR.

33:31.643 --> 33:35.147
I LOOKED AT THE PICTURES,
AND I GOT SO MAD.

33:35.147 --> 33:39.485
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY
TAKING PICTURES OF ME.

33:39.485 --> 33:44.190
NOT ANYMORE.

33:44.190 --> 33:49.561
- REGGIE, DID SOMEBODY ELSE
TAKE PICTURES OF YOU?

33:49.561 --> 33:52.631
- [scoffs]
PICTURES AND MOVIES.

33:52.631 --> 33:56.302
THEY SAID THEY'D SHOW EVERYBODY
IF I TOLD.

33:56.302 --> 33:59.605
- IT WAS HUMILIATING.

33:59.605 --> 34:02.641
COACH SCHULTZ...

34:02.641 --> 34:05.511
VIDEOTAPED ME AND HIM
IN HIS BASEMENT.

34:05.511 --> 34:10.282
[sniffs] HE SAID IF I TOLD,
HE'D SHOW EVERYBODY.

34:13.785 --> 34:15.621
WHAT?

34:15.621 --> 34:20.226
- WELL, IT MIGHT EXPLAIN
WHY YOU WENT OFF ON COACH ALEXEI

34:20.226 --> 34:23.595
WHEN YOU SAW HIM
VIDEOTAPING THOSE BOYS.

34:25.297 --> 34:27.566
- I DON'T--
I DON'T WANT ANYONE TO KNOW.

34:27.566 --> 34:30.436
I DON'T WANT
ANYONE TO KNOW.

34:30.436 --> 34:33.272
- IF SCHULTZ TAPED JOHNNY,
EVEN IF HE LETS US USE IT,

34:33.272 --> 34:34.606
THE STATUTE'S RUN OUT.

34:34.606 --> 34:36.208
- BUT NOT ON POSSESSION
OF CHILD PORN.

34:36.208 --> 34:37.676
LOOK, SCHULTZ
REMEMBERED DETAILS,

34:37.676 --> 34:39.611
I MEAN,
WHAT THE BOYS WORE.

34:39.611 --> 34:41.180
IT'S LIKE HE'S BEEN REPLAYING
A HIGHLIGHT REEL.

34:41.180 --> 34:42.814
I BET HE STILL HAS
THOSE TAPES.

34:42.814 --> 34:44.516
- LET'S CALL THE D.A. AND GET
A WARRANT BEFORE HE STARTS

34:44.516 --> 34:46.552
TAPING THE KID
HE'S GOT UP THERE NOW.

34:46.552 --> 34:49.555
- WITH JUST THREE DAYS TO GO
BEFORE THE EXECUTION,

34:49.555 --> 34:52.424
ACTIVIST ATTORNEY BAYARD ELLIS
HAS FILED A MOTION

34:52.424 --> 34:55.327
ALLEGING
PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT.

34:56.695 --> 35:01.533
- DAMN, LOOKS LIKE
HE GOT RID OF EVERYTHING.

35:01.533 --> 35:03.835
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE VIDEOS THAT WERE IN HERE?

35:03.835 --> 35:05.637
- COACH TOLD ME
NOT TO SAY.

35:05.637 --> 35:09.575
- PABLO, CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

35:09.575 --> 35:12.211
COME ON.

35:15.214 --> 35:17.183
- MS. LATHROP, REGGIE RHODES
WAS THE FIRST HOMICIDE

35:17.183 --> 35:18.884
YOU TRIED
AS A LEAD PROSECUTOR,

35:18.884 --> 35:20.652
AND IT WAS
A DEATH PENALTY CASE.

35:20.652 --> 35:22.521
SOUNDS LIKE
A LOT OF PRESSURE.

35:22.521 --> 35:24.756
- IT WAS A PARTICULARLY
BRUTAL MURDER.

35:24.756 --> 35:26.825
IT WAS MY DUTY TO SEE
THAT JUSTICE WAS DONE

35:26.825 --> 35:29.561
FOR THE VICTIM
AND FOR HIS FAMILY.

35:29.561 --> 35:31.563
- AND GIVEN THAT THE DEFENDANT'S
LIFE WAS AT STAKE,

35:31.563 --> 35:33.765
YOU OF COURSE
FAMILIARIZED YOURSELF

35:33.765 --> 35:35.634
WITH ALL ASPECTS
OF THIS CASE?

35:35.634 --> 35:37.503
- WELL,
I HAD A SUPERVISOR,

35:37.503 --> 35:38.704
BUT I LIVED WITH IT
EVERY DAY

35:38.704 --> 35:40.439
UNTIL I GOT
THAT CONVICTION.

35:40.439 --> 35:42.541
SO...[chuckles]
YES, COUNSELOR,

35:42.541 --> 35:45.611
I WOULD SAY THAT I KNOW
THE FACTS AS WELL AS ANYONE.

35:45.611 --> 35:47.479
AND THE LAW.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.848
- PLEASE DON'T TELL HIM
I SHOWED YOU THIS.

35:49.848 --> 35:52.318
- MARTIN ASKED YOU
TO BURN THESE?

35:52.318 --> 35:53.785
- THE DAY
AFTER YOU GUYS WERE HERE.

35:53.785 --> 35:55.687
HE HAD BOXES OF THEM.

35:55.687 --> 35:58.190
YOU KNOW,
OLD SPORTS TAPES.

35:58.190 --> 35:59.491
- BOXES.

35:59.491 --> 36:02.561
WELL, THAT WOULD
HAVE TAKEN A LONG TIME.

36:02.561 --> 36:06.198
- THE FIRE WENT OUT.
I DIDN'T GET TO THEM ALL.

36:07.566 --> 36:09.435
- AND I'M SURE YOU
THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED

36:09.435 --> 36:11.603
BOTH THE VICTIM AND THE
DEFENDANT'S PERSONAL HISTORIES.

36:11.603 --> 36:13.772
- I'M A PROSECUTOR,
NOT A SOCIAL WORKER.

36:13.772 --> 36:15.441
BUT I DID MY JOB.

36:15.441 --> 36:17.709
- SO YOU WERE AWARE THAT,
AS A YOUNG BOY,

36:17.709 --> 36:20.912
REGGIE RHODES WAS SERIALLY
ABUSED BY A NUMBER OF ADULT MEN.

36:20.912 --> 36:22.881
- NEITHER HE NOR HIS DEFENSE
ATTORNEY BROUGHT THAT UP.

36:22.881 --> 36:24.750
- WELL, MS. LATHROP,
AT THE TRIAL, YOU TOLD THE JURY

36:24.750 --> 36:26.885
THAT THIS WAS A MURDER
BETWEEN STRANGERS.

36:26.885 --> 36:30.289
A ROBBERY GONE BAD,
CORRECT?

36:30.289 --> 36:31.923
- AND THE JURY AGREED
WITH ME.

36:31.923 --> 36:33.759
THEY HANDED DOWN
THE APPROPRIATE SENTENCE.

36:33.759 --> 36:35.394
- WERE YOU AWARE
OF A PRIOR RELATIONSHIP

36:35.394 --> 36:37.829
BETWEEN MR. RHODES
AND THE VICTIM?

36:37.829 --> 36:40.566
- I DON'T RECALL
EVER HEARING THAT.

36:40.566 --> 36:42.634
- AND YET DETECTIVES WERE ABLE
TO TRACK REGGIE RHODES DOWN

36:42.634 --> 36:44.870
BECAUSE THE VICTIM'S WIFE
I.D.'D HIM AS SOMEONE

36:44.870 --> 36:48.274
THE HUSBAND OFTEN HIRED
AS A HANDYMAN.

36:48.274 --> 36:51.410
- IT'S BEEN 20 YEARS,
BUT MY MEMORY

36:51.410 --> 36:54.546
IS THAT FORENSIC EVIDENCE
LED TO HIS BEING APPREHENDED.

36:54.546 --> 36:58.417
- FORENSIC EVIDENCE.
THAT WOULD INCLUDE FOOTPRINTS?

36:58.417 --> 37:00.819
- HEY. HEY!

37:00.819 --> 37:04.690
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU PEOPLE
DOING HERE, HUH?

37:04.690 --> 37:06.525
GET OFF MY PROPERTY!

37:06.525 --> 37:08.827
- GOT A WARRANT
TO SEARCH YOUR CRIB, COACH.

37:08.827 --> 37:13.899
- THIS IS FOR MY HOUSE!
YOU GOT NO BUSINESS IN MY SHED!

37:13.899 --> 37:15.567
THIS IS AN ILLEGAL SEARCH!

37:15.567 --> 37:17.603
ANYTHING YOU FIND IN THERE
WILL BE INADMISSIBLE.

37:17.603 --> 37:21.340
- YOU NEED YOUR READING GLASSES.
IT SAYS PROPERTY, NOT HOUSE.

37:23.909 --> 37:27.346
- I GIVE YOU ONE THING TO DO,
AND YOU CAN'T EVEN FINISH THAT.

37:27.346 --> 37:28.814
- MARTIN, I'M SORRY.
I TRIED.

37:28.814 --> 37:30.649
- YOU SOLD ME OUT,
YOU LITTLE BASTARD.

37:30.649 --> 37:32.451
HEY, HEY.

37:32.451 --> 37:34.686
YOU CAN'T TALK
TO HIM UNLESS I'M PRESENT.

37:34.686 --> 37:37.623
HE'S 13.
IT WOULD BE INADMISSIBLE.

37:37.623 --> 37:41.993
IT WON'T STAND UP!
I'M HIS LEGAL GUARDIAN!

37:41.993 --> 37:44.630
- NOT FOR LONG. YOU'RE
UNDER ARREST, MR. SCHULTZ.

37:44.630 --> 37:47.833
- YOU THINK YOU'RE PROTECTING
THESE KIDS BY ARRESTING ME?

37:47.833 --> 37:50.569
YOU IDIOTS.

37:50.569 --> 37:55.073
I'M THE ONLY FATHER
THEY EVER HAD!

37:55.073 --> 37:57.909
- YES, I SEE THE BARE PATCH
AND THE BLOODY FOOTPRINT.

37:57.909 --> 37:59.611
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT MIGHT HAVE CAUSED IT.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.780
- DID ANY DETECTIVES
EVER TELL YOU

38:01.780 --> 38:03.749
ABOUT POLAROIDS
FOUND ON THE KITCHEN FLOOR?

38:03.749 --> 38:06.585
INCRIMINATING PHOTOGRAPHS
OF MR. DANFORTH

38:06.585 --> 38:08.354
AND OTHER MEN
HAVING SEX WITH REGGIE?

38:08.354 --> 38:09.755
- THE POLICE
NEVER TOLD ME THAT.

38:09.755 --> 38:11.089
- BECAUSE IF HE HAD,
YOU WOULD HAVE TURNED THAT

38:11.089 --> 38:12.658
OVER TO THE DEFENSE.
- OF COURSE.

38:12.658 --> 38:14.493
- SO JUST TO RECAP,

38:14.493 --> 38:16.528
YOU DIDN'T INVESTIGATE
MR. DANFORTH'S CRIMINAL HISTORY

38:16.528 --> 38:17.863
OF SOLICITING YOUNG MEN.

38:17.863 --> 38:20.632
YOU KNEW NOTHING
ABOUT MR. RHODES'S HISTORY

38:20.632 --> 38:22.901
OF SEXUAL ABUSE,
AND YOU KNEW NOTHING

38:22.901 --> 38:26.505
ABOUT MR. DANFORTH
PAYING MR. RHODES FOR SEX?

38:26.505 --> 38:28.073
- TO THE BEST
OF MY RECOLLECTION.

38:28.073 --> 38:29.641
- AND YOU DID NOT
INTENTIONALLY HIDE

38:29.641 --> 38:31.710
ANY OF THIS INFORMATION
FROM THE DEFENSE?

38:31.710 --> 38:33.745
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

38:33.745 --> 38:36.682
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT
THERE WAS SOME NEGLIGENCE

38:36.682 --> 38:38.350
DUE TO MY INEXPERIENCE?

38:38.350 --> 38:39.718
IN HINDSIGHT, YES.

38:39.718 --> 38:42.821
BUT I WOULD NEVER
PURPOSEFULLY WITHHOLD EVIDENCE

38:42.821 --> 38:46.057
TO PUT A MAN
ON DEATH ROW.

38:53.899 --> 38:57.736
- MS. LATHROP,
ARE THESE YOUR NOTES?

38:57.736 --> 39:00.138
- I DON'T IMMEDIATELY
RECOGNIZE THEM.

39:00.138 --> 39:03.008
- IS THIS YOUR HANDWRITING?
- YES.

39:03.008 --> 39:05.611
- CAN YOU READ WHAT'S
ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE ENVELOPE?

39:05.611 --> 39:07.713
- "TO MR. HARRISON
FROM M.L."

39:07.713 --> 39:09.681
- M.L.
MARNIE LATHROP.

39:09.681 --> 39:11.917
AND THE NEXT LINE?

39:11.917 --> 39:13.685
- "FYEO."

39:13.685 --> 39:16.054
- FOR YOUR EYES ONLY.

39:16.054 --> 39:18.590
IN OTHER WORDS, NOT TO
BE SHARED WITH THE DEFENSE.

39:18.590 --> 39:21.693
AND NOW...

39:21.693 --> 39:24.630
ON THIS PAGE.

39:26.565 --> 39:29.468
STILL YOUR HANDWRITING?

39:29.468 --> 39:32.438
CAN YOU READ WHAT IT SAYS
FOR THE COURT?

39:32.438 --> 39:34.740
- YOUR HONOR, I'M NOT
COMFORTABLE USING THIS LANGUAGE.

39:34.740 --> 39:36.041
- YOU WROTE IT,

39:36.041 --> 39:37.576
AND NOW YOU'RE NOT
COMFORTABLE READING IT?

39:37.576 --> 39:40.646
- READ IT, MS. LATHROP.

39:44.550 --> 39:48.687
- "FURTHER NOTES
ON THE FAGGOT SQUAD."

39:48.687 --> 39:51.623
- GO ON.

39:51.623 --> 39:53.692
- "REGGIE RHODES'S
'ODD JOBS' FOR DANFORTH

39:53.692 --> 39:57.028
MAY REFER TO SEXUAL FAVORS."

39:57.028 --> 40:02.000
- AND AT THE BOTTOM?

40:02.000 --> 40:05.737
- "ENCLOSED ENVELOPE CONTAINS
PHOTOS FOUND AT SCENE.

40:05.737 --> 40:09.107
SEXUALLY EXPLICIT IMAGES
OF VICTIM AND DEFENDANT."

40:09.107 --> 40:12.711
- DOES THIS JOG YOUR MEMORY
ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

40:12.711 --> 40:15.647
THE LEAD DETECTIVE MENTIONED
POLAROIDS AT THE SCENE?

40:15.647 --> 40:18.216
- I HAVE NO IDEA
HOW THESE--

40:18.216 --> 40:20.719
- WOULD YOU OPEN THIS AND SHOW
THESE PHOTOS TO THE COURT?

40:20.719 --> 40:22.588
- NO. NO, I COULDN'T--

40:22.588 --> 40:24.623
- JUST LIKE YOU COULDN'T
SHOW THEM TO THE DEFENSE.

40:24.623 --> 40:25.891
- NO. THAT'S NOT
WHAT I WAS SAYING.

40:25.891 --> 40:30.496
- EVEN WHEN THIS BECAME
A DEATH PENALTY CASE!

40:30.496 --> 40:33.064
YOU DIDN'T SHARE
THESE WITH ANYONE

40:33.064 --> 40:37.569
BUT YOUR SUPERVISOR,
DID YOU?

40:40.171 --> 40:42.841
- NO.

40:50.616 --> 40:53.852
- THANK YOU.
NO FURTHER QUESTIONS.

40:56.622 --> 40:58.624
- NEVER IN 30 YEARS
ON THE BENCH HAVE I SEEN

40:58.624 --> 41:02.928
A MORE BLATANT EXAMPLE
OF PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT.

41:02.928 --> 41:06.698
I AM GOING TO GRANT A STAY
OF EXECUTION FOR MR. RHODES.

41:06.698 --> 41:10.502
HIS DEATH WARRANT IS DUE
TO EXPIRE IN TWO DAYS.

41:10.502 --> 41:13.138
I STRONGLY ADVISE
THE COUNTY PROSECUTORS

41:13.138 --> 41:16.842
TO ALLOW THAT WARRANT
TO LAPSE.

41:19.210 --> 41:23.148
[buzzer]

41:23.148 --> 41:26.518
- SO THIS TIME WE WON?
- A STAY OF EXECUTION.

41:26.518 --> 41:28.620
- WE WON, REGGIE.

41:28.620 --> 41:30.589
AND THE STATE WILL BE
LOOKING AT YOUR CASE.

41:30.589 --> 41:33.158
AND WE MAY EVEN
GET YOU A NEW TRIAL.

41:33.158 --> 41:34.693
- IN THE MEANTIME,
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU TRANSFERRED

41:34.693 --> 41:37.829
TO A DIFFERENT PRISON.

41:39.731 --> 41:41.600
- THANK YOU!

41:41.600 --> 41:43.669
- [chuckles]

41:43.669 --> 41:47.138
- [laughs]

42:39.591 --> 42:42.594
