01:17.324 --> 01:19.059
Now, we know who's stronger.

01:57.365 --> 02:00.366
Why don't
you take a seat?

02:00.368 --> 02:01.836
Be with you in a minute.

02:12.347 --> 02:13.912
Damn, I missed that booty.

02:13.914 --> 02:15.079
Yeah?

02:15.081 --> 02:16.116
It missed you.

02:20.521 --> 02:24.422
So what will it be tonight?

02:24.424 --> 02:25.958
I got a new pair of handcuffs.

02:25.960 --> 02:28.160
Are those
handcuffs for you?

02:28.162 --> 02:31.529
Or for me?

02:31.531 --> 02:32.633
Whatever you like.

02:52.487 --> 02:54.452
Yeah?

02:54.454 --> 02:54.955
Yeah.

03:14.208 --> 03:15.241
Nobody move.

03:15.243 --> 03:16.308
Don't move.

03:16.310 --> 03:18.077
What the fuck?

03:18.079 --> 03:20.112
You got a hearing
problem, Biggs?

03:20.114 --> 03:21.649
My brother said
don't fucking move.

03:27.020 --> 03:27.321
Shit.

03:31.726 --> 03:34.660
Get dressed.

03:34.662 --> 03:36.394
What about my money?

03:36.396 --> 03:37.495
You will get it later.

03:37.497 --> 03:38.262
Fuck that.

03:38.264 --> 03:39.231
I want it now.

03:39.233 --> 03:40.035
Shut up and get dressed.

03:43.904 --> 03:47.072
This is fucking bullshit.

03:47.074 --> 03:47.575
Asshole.

03:50.877 --> 03:52.911
What the fuck, Jon?

03:52.913 --> 03:55.447
You better have a
good reason for this.

03:55.449 --> 03:56.682
We do.

03:56.684 --> 03:59.986
Half our product is
in federal lockup.

03:59.988 --> 04:02.387
And five of our
boys are in custody.

04:02.389 --> 04:03.956
What?

04:03.958 --> 04:06.424
And you think I had
something to do with that?

04:06.426 --> 04:07.392
No.

04:07.394 --> 04:08.795
You don't have the balls.

04:08.797 --> 04:10.796
But someone in
Bruno's family does.

04:10.798 --> 04:13.833
And I bet you know who.

04:13.835 --> 04:15.666
Go fuck yourself, Lee.

04:15.668 --> 04:18.269
Bruno's boys have
a real respect.

04:18.272 --> 04:20.572
I wouldn't be surprised
if your old man was

04:20.575 --> 04:21.976
talking to the feds himself.

04:25.246 --> 04:26.578
Watch it, Biggs.

04:26.580 --> 04:27.912
Look at you guys.

04:27.914 --> 04:29.549
His family is so dysfunctional.

04:29.551 --> 04:32.850
He has got two of you believing
you're actually brothers.

04:32.852 --> 04:34.686
You going to
keep talking shit?

04:34.688 --> 04:37.355
Or do I have to
make sure you can't?

04:37.357 --> 04:38.090
All right.

04:38.092 --> 04:39.391
All right.

04:39.393 --> 04:43.461
Listen, word is that someone
been tipping off the feds

04:43.463 --> 04:45.297
from inside your family.

04:45.299 --> 04:46.299
Who?

04:46.301 --> 04:48.033
How the fuck would I know?

04:48.035 --> 04:49.600
Maybe it's that weasel Ricky.

04:49.602 --> 04:51.002
He looks like a rat.

04:51.004 --> 04:53.605
OK, Jon, I've had enough
of this fucking shit.

04:53.607 --> 04:55.340
I don't fucking
know, all right?

04:55.342 --> 04:56.742
But it's not us.

04:56.744 --> 04:59.977
Don't fucking move.

04:59.979 --> 05:01.580
Guns on the bed,
or I swear to god,

05:01.582 --> 05:03.084
I'll blow this guy's
fucking head off.

05:12.492 --> 05:14.028
Sorry, sweetheart, you too.

05:19.133 --> 05:19.898
That a girl.

05:19.900 --> 05:22.300
Now, your wallets.

05:22.302 --> 05:24.836
Put your fucking
wallets on the bed now.

05:24.838 --> 05:26.807
Fucking crack whore.

05:29.544 --> 05:30.445
Sure can pick them, huh, B?

05:34.614 --> 05:35.581
Thank you.

05:35.583 --> 05:37.850
Now, back the fuck up.

05:37.852 --> 05:39.087
I said back up.

06:01.109 --> 06:03.109
Nice piece.

06:03.111 --> 06:03.411
Thanks.

06:10.484 --> 06:10.984
See ya.

06:56.763 --> 06:57.264
Fuck.

07:22.689 --> 07:25.157
Fuck yeah.

07:25.159 --> 07:27.562
That's what you get when
you mess with Bruno's boy.

07:40.640 --> 07:42.143
You want some more, Jon?

08:06.900 --> 08:08.167
Whoo.

08:08.169 --> 08:10.038
That's what you get
for messing with us.

08:13.140 --> 08:14.509
Now, tell me what
I want to know.

08:18.712 --> 08:20.778
You want to know?

08:20.780 --> 08:23.050
Talk to your daddy,
you fucking pussy.

08:28.054 --> 08:30.989
You idiot, what's Bruno
gonna do if he finds

08:30.991 --> 08:34.491
out you killed one of his men?

08:34.494 --> 08:34.995
Fuck Bruno.

08:57.118 --> 08:59.551
Our boys were picked
up at the exchange.

08:59.553 --> 09:03.722
There's nothing we could do.

09:03.724 --> 09:06.592
Did I ever tell you that
you two are the toughest

09:06.594 --> 09:07.462
fighters I ever raised?

09:10.029 --> 09:11.429
Every time I sent
you in the ring,

09:11.431 --> 09:15.099
I was afraid that neither
of you would come out.

09:15.101 --> 09:17.703
But every time you fought, you...

09:17.705 --> 09:20.005
you came out stronger.

09:20.007 --> 09:21.674
Are you listening?

09:21.676 --> 09:22.907
There's a rat in the family.

09:22.909 --> 09:24.309
And Bruno.

09:24.311 --> 09:27.112
You're the one who
started trouble with Bruno.

09:27.114 --> 09:29.514
They made trouble with us.

09:29.516 --> 09:33.318
I just thought the family
needs to show strength.

09:33.320 --> 09:35.353
You don't know what
this family needs.

09:35.355 --> 09:38.089
So I'm supposed to let
these assholes disrespect us?

09:38.091 --> 09:40.127
You're supposed
to do as I say.

09:47.601 --> 09:51.471
The FBI, a rat in the
family, and now this.

09:54.274 --> 09:56.875
What's gonna happen
when I'm gone?

09:56.877 --> 10:00.780
The men will follow
who they respect.

10:00.782 --> 10:02.981
And who do you
think they respect?

10:02.983 --> 10:03.484
You?

10:08.689 --> 10:09.457
That's respect.

10:29.276 --> 10:34.579
I've decided to formally
make Jon successor.

10:34.581 --> 10:36.681
I'm gonna make an
announcement tomorrow.

10:36.683 --> 10:37.482
Jon?

10:37.484 --> 10:38.949
Why?

10:38.951 --> 10:40.218
He's respected.

10:40.220 --> 10:41.586
I've been building
this business.

10:41.588 --> 10:42.420
That's enough.

10:42.422 --> 10:42.987
Me.

10:42.989 --> 10:43.889
I've done it.

10:43.891 --> 10:44.790
And for what?

10:44.792 --> 10:46.324
To be second in command?

10:46.326 --> 10:47.595
You will do as you're told.

10:50.998 --> 10:54.466
Whatever you say, Father.

10:54.468 --> 10:54.769
Lee.

10:58.305 --> 10:59.507
He's always been a prick.

11:03.075 --> 11:06.944
He's strong, but...
but dangerous.

11:06.946 --> 11:08.316
Punching will only
get you so far.

11:11.918 --> 11:15.756
You need good
footwork, good balance.

11:19.926 --> 11:23.227
I'm relying on you, Jon.

11:23.229 --> 11:24.796
Lee is family.

11:24.798 --> 11:29.400
He's gonna need you to
guide him, carry him.

11:29.402 --> 11:33.872
Otherwise, everything I've
built, this life I provided

11:33.874 --> 11:35.409
will all be for nothing.

11:39.680 --> 11:41.981
Make a... an old man proud.

11:41.983 --> 11:43.818
And get this family
back on track.

11:47.287 --> 11:48.756
Now, get the fuck out of here.

12:04.138 --> 12:07.005
Well, that's one way to go.

12:07.007 --> 12:09.440
Detective Stern.

12:09.442 --> 12:13.511
Could you give us a moment?

12:13.513 --> 12:16.247
Bersetti, it's been a while.

12:16.249 --> 12:17.683
How's your son doing?

12:17.685 --> 12:19.217
He's an asshole.

12:19.219 --> 12:22.521
Well, like father, like son.

12:22.523 --> 12:24.790
Holy shit.

12:24.792 --> 12:26.891
Is that Mark Biggs under there?

12:26.893 --> 12:28.660
It sure is, Paul.

12:28.662 --> 12:29.928
No forced entry.

12:29.930 --> 12:31.596
No shell casings.

12:31.598 --> 12:32.731
No bullet holes.

12:32.733 --> 12:34.332
Listen, I didn't ask
you here to investigate

12:34.334 --> 12:36.367
my crime scene, OK?

12:36.369 --> 12:37.602
So what's the point?

12:37.604 --> 12:39.371
Well, the point is
the manager showed

12:39.373 --> 12:40.639
me some surveillance footage.

12:40.641 --> 12:44.543
And guess who was caught
fleeing the scene?

12:44.545 --> 12:45.243
What the fuck?

12:45.245 --> 12:46.145
Yeah.

12:46.147 --> 12:47.011
That's not their style.

12:47.013 --> 12:48.413
Just look into it.

12:48.415 --> 12:50.116
If there's some infighting
going on between Bruno

12:50.118 --> 12:53.184
and the old men, that
would be some big news.

12:53.186 --> 12:54.019
Yeah.

12:54.021 --> 12:54.388
I'll look into it.

13:05.231 --> 13:06.330
I'm telling you, Lee.

13:06.332 --> 13:07.601
I'm not a fucking rat.

13:12.840 --> 13:15.843
That's exactly what a
fucking rat would say.

13:18.912 --> 13:19.814
String him up.

13:53.247 --> 13:55.679
You know he wouldn't
approve of this.

13:55.681 --> 13:57.080
Come on, Jon.

13:57.082 --> 13:58.949
What do you want me to do?

13:58.951 --> 14:00.218
Ask him nicely?

14:00.220 --> 14:03.788
Teach him a lesson in the ring?

14:03.790 --> 14:05.393
There's only one way
to get the truth.

14:09.196 --> 14:12.131
And you know that.

14:12.133 --> 14:14.032
We all know the rules.

14:14.034 --> 14:19.170
Never, under any circumstances,
rat on your family.

14:19.172 --> 14:21.506
Lee, please, it's not me, man.

14:21.508 --> 14:23.174
I fucking swear to you.

14:23.176 --> 14:24.709
It could be anybody.

14:24.711 --> 14:26.444
Why me?

14:26.446 --> 14:27.478
You gotta listen, man.

14:27.480 --> 14:29.014
Why the fuck would I do this?

14:29.016 --> 14:30.649
Jon, tell him.

14:30.651 --> 14:32.383
Not like this.

14:32.385 --> 14:33.718
Back off, Jon.

14:33.720 --> 14:34.987
He's either the rat or
he knows who the rat is.

14:34.989 --> 14:35.987
Holy shit.

14:35.989 --> 14:36.954
Just get me down from this...

14:36.956 --> 14:39.290
Shut the fuck up, Ricky.

14:39.292 --> 14:42.426
Like I said, not look like this.

14:42.428 --> 14:43.263
We got a problem.

14:59.479 --> 15:02.146
You motherfucking,
cocksucking,

15:02.148 --> 15:05.351
backstabbing pieces of shit.

15:05.353 --> 15:06.650
Which one of you
two rat fucks is

15:06.652 --> 15:08.252
gonna explain to
me how the fucking

15:08.254 --> 15:10.454
feds crushed our fucking party?

15:10.456 --> 15:12.490
Your guess is as good as ours.

15:12.492 --> 15:15.193
For all we know,
you tipped them off.

15:15.195 --> 15:16.493
Right.

15:16.495 --> 15:19.497
And why the fuck is
that asshole tied up?

15:19.499 --> 15:21.466
Are you two fucks
into some sick bondage

15:21.468 --> 15:22.833
shit or something like that?

15:22.835 --> 15:25.437
Don't answer that.

15:25.439 --> 15:27.805
You owe me a shipment of guns.

15:27.807 --> 15:31.041
You owe me retribution
for the men I lost.

15:31.043 --> 15:31.743
You know what?

15:31.745 --> 15:32.743
Fuck this.

15:32.745 --> 15:35.613
I want to speak to
the old man, now.

15:35.615 --> 15:38.349
He doesn't want to see you.

15:40.854 --> 15:44.054
What my brother means to
say is, if you have a problem,

15:44.056 --> 15:44.925
deal with us.

15:48.963 --> 15:52.698
Jon, Jon.

15:52.700 --> 15:57.135
Jon, Jon, go fuck yourself.

15:57.137 --> 16:00.939
Then, go fuck your brother.

16:00.941 --> 16:01.441
Fuck.

16:10.182 --> 16:11.784
Drop them.

16:11.786 --> 16:12.817
Tell them.

16:12.819 --> 16:15.987
Didn't I told you
to go fuck yourself?

16:15.989 --> 16:18.290
Tell them.

16:18.292 --> 16:18.792
Drop them.

16:26.133 --> 16:27.531
Fuckers.

16:27.533 --> 16:30.535
You'll get your shipment
at next week's exchange.

16:30.537 --> 16:32.905
But this wasn't us.

16:32.907 --> 16:35.676
In the meantime, I suggest
you show a bit more respect.

16:38.411 --> 16:39.479
You can go now.

16:44.118 --> 16:46.918
Motherfucker, cocksuckers.

16:46.920 --> 16:47.854
Let's fucking go.

17:07.406 --> 17:10.642
I was expecting at
least a phone call.

17:10.644 --> 17:12.911
It's been a busy day.

17:12.913 --> 17:14.213
Yeah.

17:14.214 --> 17:15.949
Your boys got picked
up by the feds.

17:19.852 --> 17:22.654
Any idea how?

17:22.656 --> 17:23.454
No.

17:23.455 --> 17:25.424
Do you?

17:25.425 --> 17:26.527
I'm looking into it.

17:29.428 --> 17:32.396
Nothing you want to talk about?

17:32.398 --> 17:35.000
Not with you.

17:35.002 --> 17:37.402
Watch your back, Jon.

17:37.404 --> 17:38.403
Yeah.

17:38.405 --> 17:39.773
Eyes on the back of my head.

17:53.119 --> 17:53.620
Hey, Jon.

17:58.859 --> 18:02.694
Hey, Jon, a four
letter word for something

18:02.696 --> 18:05.933
- bad to be thrown at you?
- A book?

18:37.930 --> 18:40.098
Is there
a problem, Chloe?

18:40.100 --> 18:41.499
No ma'am.

18:41.501 --> 18:43.204
Let's take it again
from the top, ladies.

18:54.313 --> 18:55.312
Ready?

18:55.314 --> 18:55.815
And.

19:39.425 --> 19:40.424
See you tomorrow, Chloe.

19:40.426 --> 19:42.460
Bye.

19:42.462 --> 19:45.562
Here comes trouble.

19:45.564 --> 19:47.231
You look like shit.

19:47.233 --> 19:49.634
That bad, huh?

19:49.636 --> 19:52.103
Listen, I'm just going
to go to bed now.

19:52.105 --> 19:53.271
No.
Come on.

19:53.273 --> 19:54.672
You have to practice.

19:54.674 --> 19:56.540
I'm really not in
the mood tonight.

19:56.542 --> 19:57.945
That's when you need
to do it the most.

20:06.587 --> 20:09.223
Now, where did we leave off?

20:12.292 --> 20:13.692
Oh, right.

20:13.694 --> 20:16.627
Arabesque.

20:16.629 --> 20:18.229
Arabesque.

20:18.231 --> 20:19.763
We'll start here.

20:19.765 --> 20:22.032
Move to here like so.

20:22.034 --> 20:22.700
Finish.

20:22.702 --> 20:26.070
And then arabesque.

20:26.072 --> 20:26.904
Come on.

20:26.906 --> 20:27.575
You were getting really good.

20:30.409 --> 20:32.176
Ready?

20:32.178 --> 20:36.850
1, 2, 3.

20:42.522 --> 20:44.688
We might need to
work on your balance.

20:44.690 --> 20:45.757
My balance is just fine.

20:45.759 --> 20:47.291
The floor is slippery.

20:47.293 --> 20:50.028
Take your socks and shoes off.

20:50.030 --> 20:52.366
Or it could get you
a pair of these.

21:02.676 --> 21:05.710
Starting in fifth position.

21:05.712 --> 21:06.810
Tummy tight.

21:06.812 --> 21:08.146
Shoulders down.

21:08.148 --> 21:09.114
Chin up.

21:09.116 --> 21:11.116
Long neck.

21:11.118 --> 21:12.986
And lift.

21:17.057 --> 21:19.223
Much better.

21:19.225 --> 21:21.424
You know, you're pretty
cute when you dance.

21:21.426 --> 21:22.896
You should see me boxing.

21:26.367 --> 21:28.934
Southpaw.

21:28.936 --> 21:30.734
Tricky.

21:30.736 --> 21:33.104
Watch out for this guy.

21:33.106 --> 21:34.504
He's a southpaw.

21:34.506 --> 21:35.676
He has a mean right hook.

21:41.113 --> 21:43.348
You know, Bruno isn't
happy about today.

21:43.350 --> 21:47.118
That's the least of
our problems right now.

21:47.120 --> 21:49.255
The Old Man is turning
the family over to Jon.

21:52.525 --> 21:55.460
So what now?

21:55.462 --> 21:58.329
I'm handling it.

21:58.331 --> 21:58.831
Yeah.

22:01.600 --> 22:02.735
This is the guy?

22:10.976 --> 22:13.246
Hey, don't fuck
around with this guy.

22:43.709 --> 22:44.408
Come on.

22:44.410 --> 22:44.777
Let's go.

23:34.025 --> 23:36.828
As tough as bricks, huh?

23:36.830 --> 23:38.232
Not tough enough.

23:41.334 --> 23:43.867
Set up a meeting
with Bruno tonight.

23:43.869 --> 23:46.471
We'll keep it between us.

23:46.473 --> 23:48.039
You want to learn
about the business?

23:48.041 --> 23:49.507
I'll teach you
about the business.

23:49.509 --> 23:51.242
But for tonight, I want
you to wait outside.

23:51.244 --> 23:53.278
Because I got to talk business
with these mooks and I

23:53.280 --> 23:54.244
don't trust them.

23:54.246 --> 23:55.646
You think you could
do that for me?

23:55.648 --> 23:57.749
You already have
bodyguards, Bruno.

23:57.751 --> 23:59.716
When are you gonna
let me sit-in on this?

23:59.718 --> 24:01.018
You know, learn the business?

24:01.020 --> 24:02.186
When you stop being
a little fucking shit.

24:02.188 --> 24:03.386
Where were you
when this happened?

24:03.388 --> 24:04.588
Huh?

24:04.590 --> 24:07.959
Stop fucking around and
just do what you're told.

24:07.961 --> 24:10.461
You understand?

24:10.463 --> 24:11.999
You want to learn
about the business.

24:18.103 --> 24:20.437
Why am I explaining
myself to you, Angelo?

24:20.439 --> 24:21.705
This is unacceptable.

24:21.707 --> 24:22.874
Period.

24:22.876 --> 24:24.408
What do you
expect me to do?

24:24.410 --> 24:27.912
Hand over that rat fuck Lee,
so I can poke his eye out.

24:27.914 --> 24:28.780
Come on, Bruno.

24:28.782 --> 24:30.947
It's not that bad.

24:30.949 --> 24:31.517
Please, sit down.

24:42.262 --> 24:45.264
It's not easy, being
strong for them, my boys.

24:48.769 --> 24:50.201
They see me as a father.

24:50.203 --> 24:53.538
You know what
that's like, Bruno.

24:53.540 --> 24:56.072
How old is your nephew now?

24:56.074 --> 24:59.376
Old enough to stop
fucking around so much.

24:59.378 --> 25:02.512
Come on.
He's... he's young still.

25:02.514 --> 25:06.117
It's up to the fathers to
keep their sons in check.

25:06.119 --> 25:09.419
We got to stay strong, keep
them from falling apart.

25:09.421 --> 25:11.489
They're already
falling apart, Angelo.

25:11.491 --> 25:12.589
They have no respect.

25:12.591 --> 25:14.125
None.

25:14.127 --> 25:15.893
We have kept the peace.

25:15.895 --> 25:17.628
But those boys of yours...

25:17.630 --> 25:18.428
no, Angelo.

25:18.430 --> 25:19.763
No.

25:19.765 --> 25:23.901
I admit, Lee's a
bit of a hothead.

25:23.903 --> 25:26.805
But I can't give up on him now.

25:26.807 --> 25:30.907
You got to give these boys
some time to learn the ropes.

25:30.909 --> 25:33.645
Time, Angelo?

25:33.647 --> 25:37.115
One of my best men is
dead, because of them.

25:37.117 --> 25:39.617
You have five of yours
going to the big house.

25:39.619 --> 25:42.020
I have no product to move.

25:42.022 --> 25:44.489
You have a rat
talking to the feds.

25:44.491 --> 25:47.626
And that fuck Lee, that
loose cannon of yours,

25:47.628 --> 25:51.229
tried to take my
fucking eye out.

25:51.231 --> 25:54.965
It's a good look on
you, the... the eye patch.

25:54.967 --> 25:55.867
Good, huh?

25:55.869 --> 25:56.768
It's making you laugh?

25:56.770 --> 25:58.135
You think this is funny?

25:58.137 --> 25:59.940
Why don't I just buy
myself a fucking parrot?

26:08.447 --> 26:14.652
All I'm saying is, a
loose cannon, once tamed,

26:14.654 --> 26:15.522
is a valuable weapon.

26:18.824 --> 26:21.325
You can't let him
get away with this.

26:21.327 --> 26:22.225
No.

26:22.227 --> 26:22.926
No.

26:22.928 --> 26:23.828
No.

26:23.830 --> 26:26.763
He won't.

26:26.765 --> 26:28.299
I'll see to it.

26:28.301 --> 26:30.200
I'll make sure you're
fairly compensated

26:30.202 --> 26:33.703
for the loss of product...

26:33.705 --> 26:35.676
and your... and your man, Biggs.

26:40.746 --> 26:42.245
He was a good kid.

26:42.247 --> 26:45.316
You're a fair man, Angelo.

26:45.318 --> 26:48.152
But if you leave
the family to Lee,

26:48.154 --> 26:50.187
I don't see how I
can keep the peace.

26:50.189 --> 26:53.892
Bruno, my family's
going to Jon.

26:53.894 --> 26:55.693
The fucking lughead?

26:55.695 --> 26:56.726
He can't even speak?

26:56.728 --> 26:57.861
Does he speak?

26:57.863 --> 26:59.396
Can he handle this?

26:59.398 --> 27:02.133
Are you trying to tell me that
he can handle all of this?

27:02.135 --> 27:05.136
Jon is stronger
than you think.

27:05.138 --> 27:06.604
He'll keep Lee in check.

27:06.606 --> 27:07.137
No.

27:07.139 --> 27:07.871
No, Angelo.

27:07.873 --> 27:08.705
No.
No.

27:08.707 --> 27:09.208
No.

27:28.328 --> 27:29.926
Would you get off
the fucking thing?

27:29.928 --> 27:31.662
It's time to go.

27:31.664 --> 27:33.097
It's for you.

27:33.099 --> 27:34.234
Who the fuck is this?

28:08.100 --> 28:09.200
Hey, Bruno.

28:09.202 --> 28:10.734
How's the eye?

28:10.736 --> 28:13.239
Give me a reason not to shoot
you right here, right now.

28:16.708 --> 28:17.610
Watch it, Curly.

28:28.321 --> 28:33.390
I've got nothing to discuss
with you, you rat prick fuck.

28:33.392 --> 28:35.992
I should be talking
with your brother Jon.

28:35.994 --> 28:40.196
I hear he's got a better shot at
being the new top dog than you.

28:40.198 --> 28:42.265
And where did you hear that?

28:42.267 --> 28:45.470
A little bird told me.

28:45.472 --> 28:48.173
Convince me not to blow
your fucking head off.

28:48.175 --> 28:49.574
Go ahead.

28:49.576 --> 28:51.344
You're going to regret
it in the morning.

29:10.263 --> 29:12.562
I think you broke my finger.

29:12.564 --> 29:13.496
Jeez.

29:13.498 --> 29:15.032
I didn't know you
were so fragile.

29:15.034 --> 29:17.701
Where did you learn
to punch like that?

29:17.703 --> 29:19.272
There's a lot you
don't know about me.

29:23.042 --> 29:25.909
You know, we still haven't
talked about you moving in.

29:25.911 --> 29:28.878
I don't know why you're
still living in this dump.

29:28.880 --> 29:29.748
I like it here.

29:42.794 --> 29:47.297
So you tell me what's running
through that big head of yours?

29:47.299 --> 29:48.635
I don't have a big head.

29:51.603 --> 29:52.838
I was offered something today.

29:55.907 --> 29:57.577
What do you mean offered?

30:00.914 --> 30:03.580
Jesus, Jon, I thought
we talked about this.

30:03.582 --> 30:04.013
Just relax.

30:04.015 --> 30:04.915
OK?

30:04.917 --> 30:05.817
I'm not going to do it?

30:05.819 --> 30:06.818
Did you tell him that?

30:06.820 --> 30:07.551
Not yet.

30:07.553 --> 30:07.920
But I will.

30:12.792 --> 30:14.457
- Right.
- Look.

30:14.459 --> 30:16.626
I just need to figure out
the right way to tell him.

30:16.628 --> 30:17.427
OK?

30:17.429 --> 30:18.995
How about, no, sorry, Dad?

30:18.997 --> 30:21.467
I'm not gonna become a
criminal overlord for you.

30:26.673 --> 30:29.406
You promised me you were
gonna move on from this.

30:29.408 --> 30:31.274
You had a way out.

30:31.276 --> 30:32.777
We had a plan.

30:32.779 --> 30:35.046
Look, I am.
I have.

30:35.048 --> 30:38.950
It's... it's complicated.
he's my father.

30:38.952 --> 30:40.384
He's not your father.

30:40.386 --> 30:40.921
He's a criminal.

30:44.157 --> 30:45.557
I should probably go.

30:45.559 --> 30:46.089
Come on.

30:46.091 --> 30:47.357
Don't.

30:47.359 --> 30:51.328
We've talked about
this 100 times, Jon.

30:51.330 --> 30:52.965
You can make your own decisions.

30:56.034 --> 30:57.536
See you later, OK?

31:39.946 --> 31:40.978
Yeah?

31:40.980 --> 31:44.147
Hey, it's Ricky.

31:44.149 --> 31:45.619
I don't know how
to put this, but...

31:51.690 --> 31:52.522
What?

31:52.524 --> 31:54.291
It's the old man.

31:54.293 --> 31:56.396
He's... he's dead, Jon.

32:18.851 --> 32:20.519
He would've wanted
you to have it.

32:28.360 --> 32:31.728
Still can't believe he's gone.

32:31.730 --> 32:35.535
He was right, you know?
About me.

32:39.038 --> 32:39.939
I never listen.

32:43.109 --> 32:45.912
Truth is, if it
weren't for him...

32:51.716 --> 32:54.117
at least I still
have you, brother.

32:54.119 --> 32:55.088
Or should I say boss?

32:59.558 --> 33:03.359
Has a nice ring
to it, doesn't it?

33:03.361 --> 33:05.628
It's going to take
some getting used to.

33:05.630 --> 33:09.433
Jon, this is a good
opportunity for us, right?

33:09.435 --> 33:10.337
It's time for a change.

33:14.373 --> 33:16.408
Right now, we just
need to lay low.

33:23.649 --> 33:25.384
Hey, you're the boss.

33:28.186 --> 33:29.587
Save your speech for tonight.

33:29.589 --> 33:30.421
We have to celebrate.

34:18.036 --> 34:19.837
What's going on?

34:19.839 --> 34:23.040
Father, he stole a
necklace and then pushed me.

34:23.042 --> 34:24.007
He's lying.

34:24.009 --> 34:25.007
Shut up.

34:25.009 --> 34:25.842
That's enough.

34:25.844 --> 34:27.513
Get in the ring, both of you.

34:47.799 --> 34:49.735
It's turning out
to be quite the week.

34:55.308 --> 34:56.909
You have my condolences.

35:03.181 --> 35:07.050
Have you given any more
thought to our discussion?

35:07.052 --> 35:10.219
Or are you enjoying
being the big boss now?

35:10.221 --> 35:12.989
It's not like that.

35:12.991 --> 35:13.491
I know.

35:13.493 --> 35:15.525
I get it.

35:15.527 --> 35:16.826
But pretty soon,
you're gonna have

35:16.828 --> 35:19.762
to make the tough decisions.

35:19.764 --> 35:21.167
I can only hold out for so long.

35:24.804 --> 35:25.104
I know.

35:46.192 --> 35:49.692
You ever think about
doing something else?

35:49.694 --> 35:51.661
What do you mean
doing something else?

35:51.663 --> 35:53.163
Like what?

35:53.165 --> 35:54.398
Driving a taxi?

35:54.400 --> 35:56.266
Are you
fucking kidding me?

35:56.268 --> 35:57.634
You're already driving a taxi.

35:57.636 --> 35:58.634
Shut the fuck up.

35:58.636 --> 35:59.869
Fuck.

35:59.871 --> 36:00.806
That's the best you
can come up with?

36:25.964 --> 36:27.530
Don't worry.

36:27.532 --> 36:28.902
I have a special
night planned for you.

38:49.607 --> 38:50.109
Jon.

38:55.013 --> 38:59.983
I have something
to say to you.

38:59.985 --> 39:04.621
This is a special day.

39:04.623 --> 39:08.194
My brother deserves
a special welcome.

39:12.098 --> 39:15.665
To the man I could never be.

39:15.667 --> 39:16.666
- To Jon.
- To Jon.

39:16.668 --> 39:17.170
Jon.

39:20.272 --> 39:22.672
Speech.

39:22.674 --> 39:23.306
Speech.

39:23.308 --> 39:24.007
Speech.

39:24.009 --> 39:25.275
Speech, speech, speech.

39:25.277 --> 39:26.677
Jon, speech.

39:26.679 --> 39:28.677
Speech, come on.

39:40.659 --> 39:44.628
Right after I take a piss.

39:44.630 --> 39:45.628
Whoo.

39:45.630 --> 39:46.132
Yeah.

40:47.558 --> 40:49.559
Hey, get up.

40:52.565 --> 40:54.530
Let's go.

40:54.532 --> 40:56.034
Fuck, you're drunk.

41:22.895 --> 41:24.895
Chloe?

41:24.897 --> 41:25.929
Chloe?

41:25.931 --> 41:27.797
Jon, where are you?

41:27.799 --> 41:30.266
I've been trying to
reach you all day.

41:30.268 --> 41:32.569
I'm at this...

41:32.571 --> 41:34.103
I'm at this party.

41:34.105 --> 41:35.873
Are you at the club?

41:35.875 --> 41:37.674
There were these drugs.

41:37.676 --> 41:39.675
Don't let me
keep you from your party.

41:39.677 --> 41:40.313
No.
Wait.

44:15.000 --> 44:15.699
Shit.

44:15.701 --> 44:16.101
It's Jon.

44:59.478 --> 45:02.645
Come on.

45:02.647 --> 45:05.849
Bruno, what a fucking
piece of shit.

45:10.822 --> 45:12.725
We need to get out of here.

45:32.743 --> 45:33.411
What are you doing?

45:39.918 --> 45:40.683
Fuck.

45:43.221 --> 45:44.554
Sorry, Jon.

45:44.556 --> 45:46.625
It wasn't supposed
to happen this way.

45:51.261 --> 45:52.430
You mother fucker.

45:55.132 --> 45:58.536
after Everything
I did, he picks you.

46:09.147 --> 46:11.614
For fuck's sake, give it up.

47:10.342 --> 47:12.675
Ms. Pereira

47:12.677 --> 47:14.210
Yes?

47:14.212 --> 47:16.145
Detective Bersetti.

47:16.147 --> 47:19.482
I was hoping we could
have a conversation.

47:19.484 --> 47:20.282
OK.

47:20.284 --> 47:22.351
Privately.

47:22.353 --> 47:25.288
Do you have like a
warrant or something?

47:25.290 --> 47:27.023
I want to talk
to you about Jon.

47:43.976 --> 47:44.741
Good.

47:44.743 --> 47:45.808
You're awake.

47:45.810 --> 47:47.446
You've been out for
almost a day now.

47:52.784 --> 47:55.351
The bullets missed
all vital organs.

47:55.353 --> 47:56.721
But you lost a lot of blood.

47:59.456 --> 48:01.690
Look, I've given you some
morphine for the pain.

48:01.692 --> 48:03.293
But if you feel
like you need more,

48:03.295 --> 48:05.531
just call the nurse there
on the back of the bed.

48:07.998 --> 48:10.266
There's a few police officers
here who want to speak

48:10.268 --> 48:11.402
when you you feel up to it.

48:14.572 --> 48:16.373
Can you give me a minute?

48:16.375 --> 48:17.643
I'll see what I can do.

48:31.255 --> 48:33.956
So is he dead?

48:33.958 --> 48:35.190
I don't know.

48:35.192 --> 48:36.661
I don't think so.

48:42.534 --> 48:44.366
Ms. Pereira I need to
know if you've spoken

48:44.368 --> 48:45.870
to Jon in the last 48 hours.

48:48.672 --> 48:50.940
Detective Bersetti,
can you just

48:50.942 --> 48:53.576
tell me what this is about?

48:53.578 --> 48:57.846
There was a shooting
last night, at a nightclub.

48:57.848 --> 48:59.882
Gang related.

48:59.884 --> 49:02.288
We have reason to believe
Jon was one of the shooters.

49:05.290 --> 49:08.791
We don't know exactly
what happened.

49:08.793 --> 49:10.561
And the facts are
still thin, but...

49:14.364 --> 49:17.266
That can't be true.

49:17.268 --> 49:18.634
Jon's not a killer.

49:18.636 --> 49:20.036
I need you to understand...

49:20.038 --> 49:21.704
I'd like you to leave.

49:21.706 --> 49:22.538
I'm sorry?

49:22.540 --> 49:23.739
I can't help you.

49:23.741 --> 49:25.275
And if you don't
have a warrant, then,

49:25.277 --> 49:26.478
please, just leave me alone.

49:36.520 --> 49:38.788
You don't remember your name?

49:38.790 --> 49:40.824
You think we're
stupid, don't you?

49:40.826 --> 49:43.626
All you guys end up in
here say the same shit.

49:43.628 --> 49:44.826
Come on, buddy.

49:44.828 --> 49:47.329
Give us something
to work with here.

49:47.331 --> 49:49.465
I told you everything already.

49:49.467 --> 49:50.536
The nerve of this asshole.

49:52.837 --> 49:55.471
Look, can you call
the doctor for me?

49:55.473 --> 49:57.641
I feel really dizzy.

49:57.643 --> 49:59.342
Dizzy?

49:59.344 --> 50:00.842
OK.

50:00.844 --> 50:01.777
We'll be back.

50:01.779 --> 50:03.980
See if you can
remember anything.

50:03.982 --> 50:07.516
And
you're sure he's dead?

50:07.518 --> 50:10.320
What about the men loyal to Jon?

50:10.322 --> 50:12.188
They're gonna want
revenge on Bruno.

50:12.190 --> 50:14.155
Then, we'll let them try.

50:14.157 --> 50:16.192
It's time to clean house.

50:16.194 --> 50:19.795
Bruno can do that for us.

50:23.034 --> 50:25.168
Yeah?

50:25.170 --> 50:25.934
Where?

50:30.040 --> 50:30.676
I'll call you back.

50:52.130 --> 50:52.829
Oh, shit.

50:52.831 --> 50:53.529
That's it.

50:53.531 --> 50:54.230
That's it.

50:54.232 --> 50:55.032
He's done.

53:26.717 --> 53:29.953
So I was looking
at your chart and...

53:29.955 --> 53:30.855
holy shit.

53:32.991 --> 53:34.556
You
said Jon wouldn't

53:34.558 --> 53:37.192
go down without a fight, but
you didn't say he knows kung fu.

53:37.194 --> 53:40.862
Listen, smartass, you
need to clean this up fast.

53:40.864 --> 53:42.665
He's not the type of
person that stays down.

53:42.667 --> 53:45.034
Then, you should've shot
him in the fucking head.

53:45.036 --> 53:47.103
Idiot.

53:47.105 --> 53:48.704
Just because we
have an arrangement,

53:48.706 --> 53:50.572
it doesn't mean I have to
do all your dirty work.

53:50.574 --> 53:51.806
No, Bruno.

53:51.808 --> 53:53.608
If you don't do my
dirty work, then we

53:53.610 --> 53:57.612
don't have an arrangement.

53:57.614 --> 53:59.516
Cocksucker.

53:59.518 --> 54:04.253
You, you, clean this up.

54:04.255 --> 54:05.221
I'm fucking hungry.

54:05.223 --> 54:06.621
I got to go eat something.

54:06.623 --> 54:07.590
Bruno, wait.

54:07.592 --> 54:10.527
You don't have to do this.

54:10.529 --> 54:12.362
I don't?

54:12.364 --> 54:16.232
When Lee finds out
what you're about to do...

54:16.234 --> 54:20.735
Ricky, you pathetic rat
fuck, who do you think

54:20.737 --> 54:21.971
was on the phone?

54:21.973 --> 54:23.371
Hmm?

54:23.373 --> 54:29.378
Your new boss is cleaning house,
making way for a joint venture.

54:29.380 --> 54:31.848
Jon won't let that happen.

54:31.850 --> 54:33.882
Jon's dead before
your body's cold.

54:33.884 --> 54:35.583
Lee might've fucked up,
but we're gonna find him.

54:35.585 --> 54:37.152
And we're gonna kill them.

54:37.154 --> 54:38.790
Make sure you give
him my regards.

54:41.592 --> 54:42.224
No.

54:42.226 --> 54:42.925
Wait.

54:42.927 --> 54:44.460
I can help you find him.

54:44.462 --> 54:45.864
I know where he's gonna go.

54:49.167 --> 54:52.534
Just don't kill me.

54:52.536 --> 54:54.203
You fucking rat.

54:54.205 --> 54:57.040
Selling out your
own brother, huh?

54:57.042 --> 54:57.605
Go ahead.

54:57.607 --> 54:58.773
I'm listening.

54:58.775 --> 55:01.277
There was a girl.

55:01.279 --> 55:05.081
She's a dancer.

55:53.130 --> 55:56.264
You want to learn
about the business?

55:56.266 --> 55:57.067
Come with me.

55:57.069 --> 55:58.567
Let's go.

55:58.569 --> 56:02.739
Ricky, I
got to thank you.

56:02.741 --> 56:05.241
You've been a big help.

56:05.243 --> 56:06.375
Good boy.

56:06.377 --> 56:09.844
All you had to do was
rat out your family.

56:09.846 --> 56:12.415
So you're not gonna kill me?

56:12.417 --> 56:15.217
I won't.

56:15.219 --> 56:15.721
Tony will.

56:18.322 --> 56:21.757
I fucking hate rats.

56:21.759 --> 56:22.259
No.

56:36.406 --> 56:37.040
No.

56:37.042 --> 56:37.308
Wait.

56:46.884 --> 56:49.250
Now, let's finish
this fucking thing.

56:49.252 --> 56:49.754
Hmm?

01:04:03.955 --> 01:04:05.788
Chloe.

01:04:05.790 --> 01:04:06.554
Chloe.

01:04:06.556 --> 01:04:07.355
Jon?

01:04:07.357 --> 01:04:08.757
What are you doing here?

01:04:08.759 --> 01:04:09.427
I'll explain later.

01:04:47.297 --> 01:04:48.398
I'm sorry.

01:04:51.868 --> 01:04:52.369
You're sorry?

01:04:57.273 --> 01:04:58.672
Is everything all
right back there?

01:04:58.674 --> 01:05:03.179
Mind your own
fucking business.

01:05:03.181 --> 01:05:04.045
This is all your fault.

01:05:05.281 --> 01:05:07.983
All you can say is
your fucking sorry?

01:05:07.985 --> 01:05:09.918
Who am I kidding?

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:13.520
I did this to myself.

01:05:13.522 --> 01:05:15.523
We both know what you are.

01:05:15.525 --> 01:05:17.659
Look, I can fix this.

01:05:17.661 --> 01:05:18.425
How?

01:05:18.427 --> 01:05:20.161
You're gonna kill people?

01:05:20.163 --> 01:05:21.730
I'm done with all this.

01:05:21.732 --> 01:05:22.529
No, Jon.

01:05:22.531 --> 01:05:24.300
I'm done with all of this.

01:05:24.302 --> 01:05:25.036
You can let me out here.

01:05:30.875 --> 01:05:32.007
Don't.

01:05:32.009 --> 01:05:32.709
It's over.

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:37.547
And don't come looking for me.

01:05:42.286 --> 01:05:45.688
Where to?

01:05:45.690 --> 01:05:46.557
Just drive.

01:06:00.304 --> 01:06:04.239
Hey, listen, I usually
last longer than that.

01:06:04.241 --> 01:06:06.608
It's OK.

01:06:06.610 --> 01:06:09.110
I'll take it as a compliment.

01:06:09.112 --> 01:06:12.280
Besides, I charged you
for the full hour anyway.

01:06:14.118 --> 01:06:14.849
Fuck off.

01:06:14.851 --> 01:06:15.319
Wrong room.

01:06:31.268 --> 01:06:33.835
Oh, shit.

01:06:33.837 --> 01:06:34.339
Fuck.

01:06:40.143 --> 01:06:41.576
Wow.

01:06:41.578 --> 01:06:43.911
First Biggs, now Tony?

01:06:43.913 --> 01:06:45.850
Any of Bruno's guys
you haven't fucked?

01:06:55.525 --> 01:06:58.092
I think this was mine.

01:06:58.094 --> 01:07:00.895
You gonna kill all my clients?

01:07:00.897 --> 01:07:03.465
Get out.

01:07:03.467 --> 01:07:04.869
And don't come back this time.

01:07:08.304 --> 01:07:10.271
Good luck.

01:07:10.273 --> 01:07:11.842
Hope you last longer
with this guy.

01:07:15.578 --> 01:07:19.114
My fucking nose.

01:07:19.116 --> 01:07:21.349
Hey, Tony.

01:07:21.351 --> 01:07:25.654
Let's talk about
your Uncle Bruno.

01:07:25.656 --> 01:07:26.788
I'm starving.

01:07:26.790 --> 01:07:28.523
I haven't eaten all night.

01:07:28.525 --> 01:07:29.724
One bag of money.

01:07:29.726 --> 01:07:31.159
All this shit for
one bag of money.

01:07:31.161 --> 01:07:31.826
Go get the money.

01:07:31.828 --> 01:07:33.228
Go.

01:07:33.230 --> 01:07:35.663
Back in your father's time, back
in my father's time, carloads,

01:07:35.665 --> 01:07:37.232
truckloads full of money.

01:07:37.234 --> 01:07:38.599
Money for everyone.

01:07:38.601 --> 01:07:40.001
And we used to eat
well back then.

01:07:40.003 --> 01:07:42.003
Steak and lobster for
everybody, not these ham

01:07:42.005 --> 01:07:43.739
and cheese sandwiches
we eat in this shithole

01:07:43.741 --> 01:07:45.773
in this fucking place.

01:07:45.775 --> 01:07:48.444
What the fuck's the problem?

01:07:48.446 --> 01:07:49.545
Bag's fucking heavy.

01:07:49.547 --> 01:07:50.512
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:07:50.514 --> 01:07:51.545
Hurry the fuck up.

01:07:51.547 --> 01:07:52.313
We got to go.

01:07:52.315 --> 01:07:53.081
Give him a hand.

01:07:53.083 --> 01:07:53.849
Let's go.

01:07:53.851 --> 01:07:54.516
The bag's heavy.

01:07:54.518 --> 01:07:55.449
My balls are heavy.

01:07:55.451 --> 01:07:56.317
There's two of you.

01:07:56.319 --> 01:07:57.386
Let's go.

01:07:57.388 --> 01:07:59.054
Unbelievable.
Unbelievable.

01:08:01.157 --> 01:08:01.958
Who the fuck is this now?

01:08:04.561 --> 01:08:07.029
I can't even eat my
fucking sandwich in peace.

01:08:07.031 --> 01:08:07.862
God dammit.

01:08:07.864 --> 01:08:09.096
Just a bunch of fucking idiots.

01:08:09.098 --> 01:08:10.967
Everyone's a fucking
idiot around here.

01:08:22.145 --> 01:08:25.613
How long are these cocksuckers
gonna make me wait?

01:08:25.615 --> 01:08:27.118
Un-fucking-believable.

01:08:39.996 --> 01:08:41.595
All this time you make
me wait, I could've

01:08:41.596 --> 01:08:43.700
finished my fucking sandwich.

01:08:52.575 --> 01:08:55.510
Lee, what the fuck is going on?

01:08:55.511 --> 01:08:56.581
Lee, what the fuck?

01:09:02.919 --> 01:09:03.220
Fucker.

01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:10.492
You're supposed to be
dead, mother fucker.

01:09:10.493 --> 01:09:12.827
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

01:09:12.828 --> 01:09:15.462
I knew your brother
couldn't get the job done.

01:09:15.464 --> 01:09:18.300
Where is he?

01:09:18.301 --> 01:09:19.167
I don't know.

01:09:19.169 --> 01:09:20.600
And I don't give a fuck.

01:09:20.603 --> 01:09:23.470
Last chance.

01:09:23.473 --> 01:09:24.773
Fuck you.

01:09:24.774 --> 01:09:26.308
Show me what you got.

01:09:26.310 --> 01:09:27.210
You fucking...

01:09:48.331 --> 01:09:48.832
Nice night.

01:09:51.634 --> 01:09:53.236
You look like shit.

01:09:57.106 --> 01:09:58.676
Did you bring
what I asked for?

01:10:13.190 --> 01:10:15.593
You know, I can still
help you, if you help me.

01:10:18.695 --> 01:10:19.764
I'm not a rat.

01:10:22.232 --> 01:10:24.165
Someone
will eventually crack.

01:10:24.167 --> 01:10:26.768
They always do.

01:10:26.770 --> 01:10:29.238
You don't understand.

01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:30.641
You don't rat on family.

01:10:33.377 --> 01:10:34.344
You sure about that?

01:10:48.859 --> 01:10:50.692
The old man's been giving
up family members for years

01:10:50.694 --> 01:10:53.895
to protect himself.

01:10:53.897 --> 01:10:57.399
You want to follow his
teachings, do the same.

01:10:57.401 --> 01:10:58.100
Save yourself.

01:10:58.102 --> 01:10:59.701
Why?

01:10:59.703 --> 01:11:01.568
It doesn't matter.

01:11:01.570 --> 01:11:03.572
His life's over.

01:11:03.574 --> 01:11:06.507
Yours isn't.

01:11:06.509 --> 01:11:08.844
You want to end up like him?

01:11:08.846 --> 01:11:10.214
Or you want a chance
to start over?

01:11:14.485 --> 01:11:16.818
What's it gonna be, Jon?

01:11:25.361 --> 01:11:26.029
Is it finished?

01:11:31.101 --> 01:11:34.068
It's finished.

01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.970
Jon.

01:11:34.972 --> 01:11:36.371
It's over.

01:11:36.373 --> 01:11:37.605
Cops are on their way.

01:11:37.607 --> 01:11:38.939
I gave them everything.

01:11:38.941 --> 01:11:41.208
You didn't give me any choice.

01:11:41.210 --> 01:11:42.976
You had a choice.

01:11:42.978 --> 01:11:45.512
You could have died, like
you were supposed to.

01:11:45.514 --> 01:11:48.315
And now, you give up the family?

01:11:48.317 --> 01:11:50.184
You filthy rat.

01:11:50.186 --> 01:11:51.385
Me?

01:11:51.387 --> 01:11:53.220
Rat.

01:11:53.222 --> 01:11:55.759
You killed him, didn't
you, the Old Man?

01:11:58.861 --> 01:12:01.596
You tried to kill me.

01:12:01.598 --> 01:12:03.364
For what?

01:12:03.366 --> 01:12:06.601
To have the family for yourself.

01:12:06.603 --> 01:12:08.903
It didn't belong to you.

01:12:08.905 --> 01:12:10.807
It wasn't yours to take.

01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:19.213
It's time to settle this.

01:12:19.215 --> 01:12:21.449
Just the two of us.

01:12:21.451 --> 01:12:22.783
Right.

01:12:22.785 --> 01:12:26.387
Just the two of us.

01:12:26.389 --> 01:12:27.290
You know where I'll be.

01:13:01.525 --> 01:13:03.027
Now, we know who's stronger.

01:13:29.352 --> 01:13:32.356
True victory means
never staying down.

01:14:18.235 --> 01:14:19.234
Look at you.

01:14:21.538 --> 01:14:22.973
Always ready for a fight.

01:14:26.476 --> 01:14:29.043
How does it feel to
betray your own family?

01:14:29.045 --> 01:14:31.014
It's too bad you
can't ask the Old Man.

01:14:46.029 --> 01:14:47.298
Did your cop
friend give you this?

01:14:50.433 --> 01:14:52.600
It's all bullshit, Lee.

01:14:52.602 --> 01:14:54.534
He lied to us.

01:14:54.536 --> 01:14:55.537
We were kids.

01:14:55.539 --> 01:14:56.173
He used us.

01:14:59.176 --> 01:15:00.410
I'm done with this bullshit.

01:15:03.713 --> 01:15:06.514
You can't turn
your back on this.

01:15:06.516 --> 01:15:08.582
I already have.

01:15:08.584 --> 01:15:09.386
You should too.

01:15:25.668 --> 01:15:27.004
Get in the fucking ring.

01:15:36.879 --> 01:15:38.479
We're not kids anymore.

01:15:38.481 --> 01:15:39.814
No.

01:15:39.816 --> 01:15:40.451
No, we are.

01:16:02.739 --> 01:16:04.208
You should have let me leave.

01:16:10.547 --> 01:16:11.415
Be a sport, Jon.

01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:19.320
Didn't see that coming.

01:16:19.322 --> 01:16:20.887
That's good.

01:17:47.410 --> 01:17:47.710
Whoo.

01:17:51.548 --> 01:17:53.146
I'm going to teach
you how to stay

01:17:53.148 --> 01:18:07.764
down, like I taught our father.

01:18:54.110 --> 01:18:55.612
Stay the fuck down.

01:20:07.284 --> 01:20:10.752
Stay down.

01:20:10.754 --> 01:20:13.520
Fuck you.

01:20:13.522 --> 01:20:17.358
Never take what isn't yours.

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:21.762
Always do what is
best for the family.

01:20:21.764 --> 01:20:25.468
Never, under any
circumstances, rat on your own.

01:20:29.105 --> 01:20:30.206
It's all bullshit.

01:21:09.879 --> 01:21:10.614
You can keep it.

01:21:47.984 --> 01:21:48.485
Fuck.

01:22:24.254 --> 01:22:25.022
Still breathing, I see.

01:22:29.058 --> 01:22:30.560
I saw you on the news.

01:22:33.995 --> 01:22:37.363
Congratulations.

01:22:37.365 --> 01:22:40.634
Just a little promotion.

01:22:40.636 --> 01:22:43.307
It was one of the biggest
busts in the city's history.

01:22:49.111 --> 01:22:51.778
Did you find her?

01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:53.649
She really doesn't
want to be found.

01:22:56.119 --> 01:23:02.392
And frankly, she's tied to just
about every crime committed.

01:23:06.562 --> 01:23:12.636
We'll look the other
way, only if you're done.
