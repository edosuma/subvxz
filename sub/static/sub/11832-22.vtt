00:05.180 --> 00:07.060
- Hello.
- Hey, Rabbi.

00:07.060 --> 00:09.010
He's in his office,
you can go right in.

00:17.230 --> 00:19.060
- Rabbi.

00:19.060 --> 00:21.090
I just got off the phone
with the D.A.

00:21.090 --> 00:22.130
They're going
to be putting the girl's

00:22.130 --> 00:24.010
treating doctor up there.

00:24.010 --> 00:25.210
That's good news.
- It is.

00:25.210 --> 00:28.150
- It probably means there's
nothing conclusive he could say.

00:28.150 --> 00:30.170
It brings it down to her word
against yours.

00:30.170 --> 00:32.130
- I see.

00:32.130 --> 00:36.120
Eugene, would you mind
meeting with my board?

00:36.120 --> 00:38.180
- Your board?
- At the temple.

00:38.180 --> 00:40.190
They are paying the legal fees
and--

00:40.190 --> 00:42.070
- Why do they want to meet?

00:42.070 --> 00:43.210
- They'd like an assessment
of the case.

00:43.210 --> 00:46.200
They're no doubt
worried about damage control.

00:46.200 --> 00:50.070
If the synagogue's
rabbi is convicted of rape,

00:50.070 --> 00:52.070
I'm sure they'll want
to be prepared.

00:52.070 --> 00:54.110
- How do you feel
about me meeting with them?

00:54.110 --> 00:57.040
- I'm okay with it.
They've stuck by me, so--

01:01.160 --> 01:05.190
How are you assessing the case?

01:05.190 --> 01:08.030
- It's he said, she said, rabbi.

01:08.030 --> 01:11.030
You two were the only witnesses.

01:11.030 --> 01:12.230
You two and God.

01:15.130 --> 01:18.130
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

01:18.130 --> 01:26.110
♪ ♪

02:04.080 --> 02:06.030
- The likelihood is,
the girl will testify

02:06.030 --> 02:07.180
and then they'll rest.
I'll call you.

02:07.180 --> 02:09.050
After that, we close.

02:09.050 --> 02:12.000
This should be over
in a couple of days.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.100
I have to warn you,

02:13.100 --> 02:15.150
since this thing
is getting some publicity,

02:15.150 --> 02:17.170
the room will probably be full.

02:17.170 --> 02:19.220
You might want to convey
that to your congregation,

02:19.220 --> 02:22.120
because if they really plan
to turn out to support you,

02:22.120 --> 02:24.100
they better get there early.

02:24.100 --> 02:28.000
- I can't testify, Mr. Young.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.130
- Excuse me?

02:29.130 --> 02:36.020
- The truth here,
it could be very damning.

02:36.020 --> 02:38.100
- I thought you said
you were innocent.

02:38.100 --> 02:41.060
- I am.
I didn't rape her.

02:41.060 --> 02:46.180
But the sex--it may be--

02:46.180 --> 02:50.040
it was a little forcible.

02:50.040 --> 02:51.180
- Forcible?

02:51.180 --> 02:56.100
- It was consensual, but--

02:56.100 --> 02:57.120
- Forcible?

03:00.140 --> 03:02.190
Why don't you tell me
exactly what happened?

03:05.090 --> 03:09.170
- We had been having
a relationship

03:09.170 --> 03:13.090
and it was ending,
at her urging.

03:13.090 --> 03:15.100
It was the second time
she had come to my office

03:15.100 --> 03:17.160
for the purpose
of breaking it off.

03:17.160 --> 03:22.020
The first time
there were tears on both sides.

03:22.020 --> 03:25.100
And anger.

03:25.100 --> 03:29.080
We had an argument
which led, ultimately,

03:29.080 --> 03:32.210
to a rather passionate
session of lovemaking,

03:32.210 --> 03:37.010
followed by a mutual decision
to continue the relationship.

03:37.010 --> 03:39.020
That was the first time.

03:39.020 --> 03:42.050
This time, again,
she came to break it off,

03:42.050 --> 03:43.230
again we argued.

03:43.230 --> 03:46.170
And again,

03:46.170 --> 03:52.200
we began to kiss, fondle.

03:52.200 --> 03:57.060
At which point,
she reiterated it was wrong.

03:57.060 --> 04:00.050
But, Mr. Young,
she was the kind of person

04:00.050 --> 04:05.010
who liked sex more
when it was, well--

04:05.010 --> 04:07.160
And it was my belief,
the purpose of these breakups,

04:07.160 --> 04:10.120
it was to occasion my rage,

04:10.120 --> 04:13.000
because it excited her.

04:13.000 --> 04:18.000
The sex was
of a slightly forcible nature,

04:18.000 --> 04:20.070
even though
I remain absolutely convinced

04:20.070 --> 04:21.149
it was not only to her liking,

04:21.149 --> 04:24.040
but exactly what she wanted.

04:27.060 --> 04:29.050
- The jury
cannot hear that story.

04:29.050 --> 04:30.160
- Tell me about it.
- So he's guilty.

04:30.160 --> 04:31.230
Rabbi rapist.

04:31.230 --> 04:33.170
- In his mind,
he thinks she consented.

04:33.170 --> 04:35.020
- You know, there are thousands
and thousands

04:35.020 --> 04:36.110
of model rabbis out there.

04:36.110 --> 04:37.130
Why is it the ones
that come in here

04:37.130 --> 04:39.060
are all criminals?

04:39.060 --> 04:40.210
- Because we're criminal defense
attorneys, Ellenor.

04:40.210 --> 04:42.120
- Look, you haven't lost,
Eugene.

04:42.120 --> 04:44.080
Their case is only her word.

04:44.080 --> 04:46.150
You cross her good,
you've got reasonable doubt.

04:46.150 --> 04:48.070
- You want somebody
to second chair?

04:48.070 --> 04:50.090
- No.
Girl's 23.

04:50.090 --> 04:54.030
I don't want the jury to see
an army going against her.

04:54.030 --> 04:55.160
But the strategy's changed
a little.

04:55.160 --> 04:57.170
I could use some legwork.

04:57.170 --> 04:59.130
Chase down some old boyfriends.

04:59.130 --> 05:03.160
Jimmy?
- Whatever you need.

05:03.160 --> 05:05.130
- Thank you for meeting with us.

05:05.130 --> 05:06.140
- No problem.

05:06.140 --> 05:08.020
- Obviously, this matter

05:08.020 --> 05:10.080
is of significant concern
to the synagogue.

05:10.080 --> 05:13.070
And let me preface my remarks
by representing--

05:13.070 --> 05:15.110
- Enough with the preface.
The men works on an hourly.

05:15.110 --> 05:16.180
We pay for your prefaces.

05:16.180 --> 05:17.220
- Sam--
- Never mind.

05:17.220 --> 05:18.230
We're all busy people here.

05:18.230 --> 05:20.170
Say what you have to say.

05:20.170 --> 05:23.110
He's so damn worried all
the time about being delicate.

05:23.110 --> 05:24.190
Forgive me, rabbi.

05:24.190 --> 05:26.100
- It's all right, Sam.

05:26.100 --> 05:29.110
- Well, the fact of the matter
is, it is delicate.

05:29.110 --> 05:30.130
It goes without saying.

05:30.130 --> 05:32.020
The sordidness
of a trial

05:32.020 --> 05:34.130
would be very unfortunate
for this synagogue.

05:34.130 --> 05:36.100
We're anticipating a civil
suit as well.

05:36.100 --> 05:38.060
Since the event
in question

05:38.060 --> 05:40.010
took place
in the rabbi's office,

05:40.010 --> 05:41.160
she's already hired an attorney
who's made overtures.

05:41.160 --> 05:43.130
- The whole thing's a setup
for a civil suit.

05:43.130 --> 05:44.160
The girl is a liar.

05:44.160 --> 05:46.040
She's looking for money.

05:46.040 --> 05:47.230
As much
as we object on principle,

05:47.230 --> 05:50.110
we'll give it to her, so long
as it buys her silence.

05:50.110 --> 05:51.180
On the criminal suit as well.

05:51.180 --> 05:53.120
- You can't do that.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.020
- Technically no, of course not.

05:55.020 --> 05:56.140
But rape victims
change their minds

05:56.140 --> 05:58.010
about testifying all the time.

05:58.010 --> 06:00.070
- Why not just approach the girl
on your own?

06:00.070 --> 06:01.110
- Because I would assume

06:01.110 --> 06:03.020
that the threat
of cross-examination

06:03.020 --> 06:04.090
at the criminal trial

06:04.090 --> 06:05.220
would factor
into any negotiation.

06:05.220 --> 06:08.120
You are the only one
who can make that threat.

06:08.120 --> 06:10.070
- As well as make good on it.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.230
- What you're asking me
to do is illegal.

06:12.230 --> 06:20.190
- The legality
turns on the execution.

06:20.190 --> 06:22.010
- Let's cut to it.

06:22.010 --> 06:24.040
The man
is an enormously popular rabbi,

06:24.040 --> 06:25.130
central to our fundraising.

06:25.130 --> 06:27.110
We do not want that girl
telling her story

06:27.110 --> 06:30.100
in a courtroom
or any other public venue.

06:30.100 --> 06:33.080
We have a settlement fund.

06:33.080 --> 06:35.140
- I can't bribe a witness
in a criminal prosecution.

06:35.140 --> 06:37.130
- Don't be naive with me,
Mr. Young.

06:37.130 --> 06:39.180
You know exactly what you can
do, you know what you can't.

06:39.180 --> 06:41.040
You're the man's defense
attorney.

06:41.040 --> 06:43.010
You have a duty
to explore every option.

06:43.010 --> 06:44.170
- I don't like this one.
- Why?

06:44.170 --> 06:46.150
Where's your concern?

06:46.150 --> 06:48.110
If it lies with Rabbi Jacobs,

06:48.110 --> 06:51.060
you'll do it because it may
spare him criminal prosecution.

06:51.060 --> 06:52.110
If it lies with you,

06:52.110 --> 06:53.190
again,

06:53.190 --> 06:55.050
we are not asking you
to do anything

06:55.050 --> 06:57.170
that you cannot find
a way to do legally.

06:57.170 --> 07:00.140
If it lies with the girl, well,

07:00.140 --> 07:02.170
if this goes to trial,

07:02.170 --> 07:05.130
we all know what you'll be
doing to the girl.

07:05.130 --> 07:10.000
Don't we, Mr. Young?

07:10.000 --> 07:11.150
- Please.

07:11.150 --> 07:13.150
I apologize for Stewart.

07:13.150 --> 07:15.150
The skills needed
to be a board president

07:15.150 --> 07:17.200
differ from those needed
to be a rabbi.

07:17.200 --> 07:20.130
- You're the one
charged with rape.

07:20.130 --> 07:23.130
- And you now
consider me guilty, don't you?

07:23.130 --> 07:24.140
- I think
if you tell your story,

07:24.140 --> 07:26.110
you'll get convicted.

07:26.110 --> 07:28.190
Does the board know your story?
- No.

07:28.190 --> 07:31.130
I told them it was consensual,
which I maintain it was.

07:31.130 --> 07:35.110
I don't think
they need to know more.

07:35.110 --> 07:38.180
Eugene,
you just said

07:38.180 --> 07:40.160
if I testify,
I'll be convicted.

07:40.160 --> 07:43.150
What if I don't testify?

07:43.150 --> 07:46.130
- I don't like your chances.

07:46.130 --> 07:52.080
- So, could you at least
meet with her civil attorney?

07:52.080 --> 07:54.090
- I'm not comfortable
with this at all.

07:54.090 --> 07:55.120
- Neither am I.

07:55.120 --> 07:56.150
But, see,
a man's freedom

07:56.150 --> 07:58.080
is on the line here.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.140
His life, even.

07:59.140 --> 08:01.170
This is a very beloved rabbi.

08:01.170 --> 08:03.230
- I thought you couldn't
do this in rape cases.

08:03.230 --> 08:05.180
Dig up old boyfriends
of the victim.

08:05.180 --> 08:07.000
I thought there were laws

08:07.000 --> 08:08.180
against putting
the victim on trial.

08:08.180 --> 08:10.230
- We don't plan to do that.

08:10.230 --> 08:12.170
- I'll tell you this.

08:12.170 --> 08:14.060
Terri is not a liar.

08:14.060 --> 08:16.020
She is not going
to make something like this up.

08:16.020 --> 08:21.020
If she says she was raped,
then I believe she was.

08:21.020 --> 08:24.170
- It's possible
there was a misunderstanding.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.200
- A misunderstanding?

08:25.200 --> 08:29.130
About a rape?

08:29.130 --> 08:32.140
- We got some information.

08:32.140 --> 08:34.159
Ms. Reynolds,
maybe

08:34.159 --> 08:38.159
she liked sex
on the rougher side.

08:38.159 --> 08:41.080
- Are you suggesting maybe
she wanted to be raped?

08:41.080 --> 08:43.130
- No.

08:43.130 --> 08:46.190
I'm suggesting rough sex.

08:46.190 --> 08:51.100
He thought she'd like that.

08:51.100 --> 08:54.100
Would it be possible
for him to think that?

09:00.120 --> 09:01.190
- Can I help you?

09:01.190 --> 09:02.220
- We're here
to see Eugene Young.

09:02.220 --> 09:04.210
- Scott, hi.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.230
- Hi, Eugene.

09:08.180 --> 09:10.100
- This should be you
and me alone.

09:10.100 --> 09:13.040
I don't really think
I should have contact with her.

09:13.040 --> 09:14.140
- Okay.

09:14.140 --> 09:15.170
- We can go
in the conference room.

09:15.170 --> 09:17.000
Lucy.

09:17.000 --> 09:20.050
- Sure.

09:20.050 --> 09:21.180
- I'll just be a few minutes.

09:21.180 --> 09:24.010
- Okay.

09:24.010 --> 09:26.110
- Can I get you some coffee
or something?

09:26.110 --> 09:29.160
- I'm fine, thank you.

09:29.160 --> 09:31.180
- Thanks for coming in.

09:31.180 --> 09:34.060
- I'm a little suspect
of the timing, Eugene.

09:34.060 --> 09:36.080
A day before the criminal
trial gets underway?

09:36.080 --> 09:38.180
- This is only
about the civil litigation.

09:38.180 --> 09:40.170
Let's be clear on that.

09:40.170 --> 09:43.080
- Okay.

09:43.080 --> 09:45.090
- We're offering
$1.2 million sealed,

09:45.090 --> 09:46.220
no admission of liability.

09:46.220 --> 09:48.230
Conditioned on a complete
and total gag agreement.

09:48.230 --> 09:50.210
If she ever tells her story
in any public forum,

09:50.210 --> 09:52.110
the deal is off.

09:52.110 --> 09:54.040
- What about her testimony
at the criminal trial?

09:54.040 --> 09:55.170
- Look, I'm only talking
about the civil litigation--

09:55.170 --> 09:57.050
- I understand.

09:57.050 --> 09:58.120
But if she testifies
at the criminal trial,

09:58.120 --> 09:59.160
her story would then get out.

09:59.160 --> 10:01.150
- Right.

10:01.150 --> 10:05.070
I hadn't thought of that.

10:05.070 --> 10:07.070
The offer
would be revoked, I guess.

10:07.070 --> 10:09.150
- You hadn't thought of that?

10:09.150 --> 10:11.110
- Look, I'm not asking you
to advise your client

10:11.110 --> 10:13.030
on the criminal trial,

10:13.030 --> 10:15.190
but me and you, off the record,
doesn't leave the room?

10:15.190 --> 10:17.100
- Go ahead.

10:17.100 --> 10:19.030
- Young black woman
up against a respected rabbi.

10:19.030 --> 10:20.160
No witnesses.
- Vaginal bruising.

10:20.160 --> 10:21.160
- Inconclusive.
They're not even

10:21.160 --> 10:23.120
calling the doctor up.

10:23.120 --> 10:27.110
Plus, there's some evidence
she likes it a little rough.

10:27.110 --> 10:28.210
- What?

10:28.210 --> 10:30.010
- We talked
to some old boyfriends and--

10:30.010 --> 10:31.230
- Rape shield, Eugene.

10:31.230 --> 10:33.190
- Rape shield goes to putting
the victim's character on trial.

10:33.190 --> 10:35.090
This goes to a how issue.

10:35.090 --> 10:36.210
I think I can get
around rape shield and then--

10:36.210 --> 10:38.100
- Eugene, this is absolutely--
- Scott, listen.

10:38.100 --> 10:40.060
This is going to be one ugly,
mean trial,

10:40.060 --> 10:42.140
where she could come out with
nothing more than a nightmare.

10:42.140 --> 10:43.230
Now, there's more
than $1 million

10:43.230 --> 10:47.170
on the table.

10:47.170 --> 10:50.200
- If she suddenly changes
her mind about testifying,

10:50.200 --> 10:52.040
they'll just subpoena her.

10:52.040 --> 10:54.070
- Maybe.
Maybe not.

10:58.090 --> 11:00.030
- Go talk to her.

11:25.130 --> 11:27.040
- What's going on?

11:27.040 --> 11:28.220
- They're in my office
discussing the offer.

11:28.220 --> 11:30.200
- Which offer
could get you disbarred.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.170
- I was careful
I didn't cross the line.

11:32.170 --> 11:33.170
- Are you sure?
Because if

11:33.170 --> 11:34.210
she suddenly tells a DA

11:34.210 --> 11:36.070
she doesn't want to prosecute,

11:36.070 --> 11:37.230
we can expect a SWAT team
to show up here.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.230
- I walked the line.

11:46.130 --> 11:48.220
- Your offer is rejected.
She was raped,

11:48.220 --> 11:51.000
and she's not gonna
pretend otherwise,

11:51.000 --> 11:52.110
even for $1 million.

11:52.110 --> 11:53.210
Now, I'm going
to bring her through.

11:53.210 --> 11:55.010
I don't want you speaking
to her.

11:55.010 --> 11:57.010
- I wasn't planning to.

12:13.040 --> 12:15.030
- So I guess the theory
she's trying to get some money,

12:15.030 --> 12:16.050
that's shot?

12:16.050 --> 12:17.200
- It can still be argued.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.060
The jury won't know
anything about this offer.

12:19.060 --> 12:21.060
Settlement discussions
are inadmissible.

12:21.060 --> 12:23.050
- Can you still argue it
knowing it isn't true?

12:23.050 --> 12:24.180
- We don't know anything,
Rebecca, it could be she

12:24.180 --> 12:26.000
turned down $1 million

12:26.000 --> 12:27.140
because she was looking
for $2 million.

12:27.140 --> 12:30.180
We don't know anything.

12:30.180 --> 12:32.170
- One boyfriend said she liked
to get a little physical.

12:32.170 --> 12:33.230
He didn't use the word rough--

12:33.230 --> 12:34.230
- What about the other
boyfriend?

12:34.230 --> 12:36.160
There were two names.

12:36.160 --> 12:38.180
- He threatened to call
the police if I didn't leave.

12:38.180 --> 12:40.200
- Well, I got something, anyway.

12:40.200 --> 12:42.030
I'm due at a pretrial.

12:42.030 --> 12:43.150
- You sure
you don't want a backup?

12:43.150 --> 12:45.080
- I'm fine.

13:05.140 --> 13:08.040
- They're bringing
in a hired gun DA.

13:08.040 --> 13:09.230
We've been up
against him before.

13:09.230 --> 13:11.220
He's tough.

13:11.220 --> 13:14.060
- Any good news?
- Well, actually, yes.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.160
I just came from the pretrial
conference.

13:16.160 --> 13:18.120
I told the judge
if they introduce any evidence

13:18.120 --> 13:20.080
of vaginal bruising,

13:20.080 --> 13:24.170
that we'd be offering evidence
of her sexual preferences.

13:24.170 --> 13:27.080
They tried to get it excluded
on the rape shield.

13:27.080 --> 13:28.220
The judge said he might hear it,

13:28.220 --> 13:30.150
depending on our offer of proof.

13:30.150 --> 13:32.070
Bottom line,

13:32.070 --> 13:33.220
I don't think the DA
will go near the medicals.

13:33.220 --> 13:37.160
It was inconclusive
to begin with.

13:37.160 --> 13:38.160
That's good.

13:41.200 --> 13:45.090
- Are we ready, Mr. Young?

13:45.090 --> 13:46.170
- We're ready.

13:58.170 --> 14:01.100
[reporters clamoring]

14:01.100 --> 14:03.110
- You trying to bribe my sister?
- Get away from me.

14:03.110 --> 14:04.220
- You trying to bribe
my sister, Counsel?

14:04.220 --> 14:06.080
- Okay, let's go.
- You rape her and then

14:06.080 --> 14:07.210
you buy her off?
That's what you think?

14:07.210 --> 14:12.000
- Let's go.
- Get off me, man.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.170
- We had first met
at a drug counseling center

14:14.170 --> 14:16.040
where we both volunteered.

14:16.040 --> 14:17.180
We became friends.

14:17.180 --> 14:20.180
We'd get coffee
sometimes after work.

14:20.180 --> 14:23.090
- And at some point
you became more than friends?

14:23.090 --> 14:25.010
- Yes.

14:25.010 --> 14:27.130
After a few months,
he asked me to go to a movie.

14:27.130 --> 14:31.000
We talked about movies
a lot, so, one time,

14:31.000 --> 14:32.210
he asked if I'd join him.

14:32.210 --> 14:34.120
I said, half joking, you know,

14:34.120 --> 14:37.020
"People will think
we're dating."

14:37.020 --> 14:40.070
And then he asked,
actually he said,

14:40.070 --> 14:42.080
that he would like that.

14:42.080 --> 14:44.110
To date.
- And your response?

14:44.110 --> 14:46.040
- I said, "Hello?

14:46.040 --> 14:50.130
You're old enough to be
my father's minister."

14:50.130 --> 14:53.190
More and more, I don't know.

14:53.190 --> 14:55.150
I became infatuated.

14:55.150 --> 14:58.000
At first, I thought,
just with his wisdom,

14:58.000 --> 14:59.170
but then, with him.

14:59.170 --> 15:02.150
And by six months,
we were dating.

15:02.150 --> 15:05.210
- Was the relationship physical?
- Yes.

15:05.210 --> 15:07.230
And it was passionate.

15:07.230 --> 15:12.040
- But, at some point,
things changed.

15:12.040 --> 15:13.060
- I met somebody.

15:13.060 --> 15:15.170
Somebody my own age.

15:15.170 --> 15:17.130
And I--

15:17.130 --> 15:20.000
Well, I fell in love with him.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.230
- Did you tell this
to Rabbi Jacobs?

15:21.230 --> 15:23.030
- Yes.

15:23.030 --> 15:24.150
I went to his office.

15:24.150 --> 15:25.220
And, by this time,

15:25.220 --> 15:27.150
I know he was very much
in love with me.

15:27.150 --> 15:29.060
- Objection.
- Overruled.

15:29.060 --> 15:32.230
- How did you know this?
- Well, he told me, many times.

15:32.230 --> 15:35.220
Plus, he seemed
to be becoming more obsessive.

15:35.220 --> 15:37.110
- Objection.
- Overruled.

15:37.110 --> 15:39.120
- How did he seem more
obsessive?

15:39.120 --> 15:42.020
- Well, he would want
to see me more and more often,

15:42.020 --> 15:46.080
and he'd call
sometimes three times a day.

15:46.080 --> 15:48.050
- Turning your attention

15:48.050 --> 15:50.060
back to that night...
- Yes.

15:50.060 --> 15:52.200
I went to his office
to tell him.

15:52.200 --> 15:55.050
It had to be over.

15:55.050 --> 15:57.060
He became enraged.

15:57.060 --> 15:59.020
We started shouting
at one another.

15:59.020 --> 16:00.040
- You were yelling as well?

16:00.040 --> 16:01.120
- Oh, yes.

16:01.120 --> 16:03.040
I had some issues.

16:03.040 --> 16:06.160
But when I made it clear
I was really leaving,

16:06.160 --> 16:09.140
he just grabbed me

16:09.140 --> 16:13.110
and he said something
like, "Stop the game."

16:13.110 --> 16:14.180
- Stop the game?

16:14.180 --> 16:16.160
- He thought
that I was trying

16:16.160 --> 16:19.030
to work him up
into some anger

16:19.030 --> 16:21.020
because he thought
that I thought

16:21.020 --> 16:22.050
it made him a better lover.

16:22.050 --> 16:24.030
It was ridiculous.

16:24.030 --> 16:26.140
- When you say he grabbed you--

16:26.140 --> 16:27.230
- By the arms.

16:27.230 --> 16:32.020
I said, "Let go of me,"
but he wouldn't.

16:32.020 --> 16:37.180
He starts forcing his tongue
into my mouth.

16:37.180 --> 16:39.140
I told him no.

16:39.140 --> 16:46.070
Then,
he pushed me onto the ground

16:46.070 --> 16:49.020
and he's pushing my dress
up--

16:49.020 --> 16:50.200
- Were you trying to get away?

16:50.200 --> 16:52.020
- Yes.

16:52.020 --> 16:54.000
I'm telling him to get off.

16:54.000 --> 17:00.080
Then,
he--he has me by the wrists,

17:00.080 --> 17:06.030
and he's using his knees
to push my thighs apart.

17:06.030 --> 17:10.050
And then, he was in me.

17:10.050 --> 17:13.020
He was pushing himself
inside of me.

17:13.020 --> 17:15.050
- Did you yell for help?

17:15.050 --> 17:18.000
- I don't really remember.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.140
All I remember thinking,

17:20.140 --> 17:24.060
my God, this is one
of the kindest,

17:24.060 --> 17:28.140
most gentle people
I've ever met.

17:28.140 --> 17:33.100
And then, being raped by him.

17:33.100 --> 17:35.190
The man was raping me.

17:42.010 --> 17:45.000
[reporters clamoring]

17:54.150 --> 17:57.070
- Okay, I got to pick
that testimony apart.

17:57.070 --> 17:59.030
Where was she wrong?

17:59.030 --> 18:02.070
- I don't believe she was.

18:02.070 --> 18:05.020
I mean,
in her mind,

18:05.020 --> 18:07.000
I assume that's what happened.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.080
But she didn't scream,
Mr. Young,

18:08.080 --> 18:11.030
she didn't say
get off me.

18:11.030 --> 18:12.210
She said things like,
"This is wrong.

18:12.210 --> 18:14.030
Don't do this."

18:14.030 --> 18:15.220
- The difference
in your mind being?

18:15.220 --> 18:18.190
- For much of our history,
in the throes of making love,

18:18.190 --> 18:20.100
we would both say
things like this.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.110
We shouldn't be doing this,
what are we doing?

18:22.110 --> 18:24.180
We went to the head
versus heart conflict.

18:24.180 --> 18:27.080
If you see it in a movie,
it's romantic even.

18:27.080 --> 18:29.010
- Well, this is no movie,

18:29.010 --> 18:31.080
and it's not
coming off romantic.

18:35.220 --> 18:39.110
- I didn't rape her, Mr. Young.
It is possible

18:39.110 --> 18:41.020
that she really
didn't want to make love

18:41.020 --> 18:46.020
and that I was wrong,
but I--we talked after.

18:46.020 --> 18:47.160
And when she was saying
it was wrong,

18:47.160 --> 18:50.080
she was saying,
"We shouldn't have done that."

18:50.080 --> 18:52.160
Not <i>you; we.</i>

18:52.160 --> 18:54.200
And she didn't run out.

19:02.130 --> 19:05.130
I can't believe
this is happening.

19:15.020 --> 19:18.140
- Would you like to explore
a lesser charge?

19:18.140 --> 19:22.130
Maybe we could plead
some kind of assault?

19:22.130 --> 19:27.090
- I'm innocent, Mr. Young.

19:27.090 --> 19:30.230
I'm innocent.

19:30.230 --> 19:33.170
- So why not just
have him tell his story?

19:33.170 --> 19:35.040
- "I thought
she really wanted it;

19:35.040 --> 19:37.040
resisting was part of the game"?

19:37.040 --> 19:39.080
He'd be convicted
before he gets out of the chair.

19:39.080 --> 19:41.150
- So what are you going to do?

19:41.150 --> 19:47.050
- I just have to go at her,
whack her credibility.

19:47.050 --> 19:48.230
What?

19:48.230 --> 19:50.100
- She told the truth.

19:50.100 --> 19:52.030
You pretty much know
she told the truth,

19:52.030 --> 19:53.210
and you're going
to get up tomorrow

19:53.210 --> 19:55.140
and do everything you can
to make her look like a liar?

19:55.140 --> 19:56.230
- I don't have much choice.

19:56.230 --> 19:58.140
How about she's entitled
to her story?

19:58.140 --> 20:00.000
He's entitled to his.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.220
Let the jury decide.

20:01.220 --> 20:04.050
- [laughs]

20:04.050 --> 20:07.110
- Do you even see the perversity
of what you're about to do?

20:07.110 --> 20:08.180
- Look, we're having dinner
for lunch.

20:08.180 --> 20:10.050
If we're going to fight,

20:10.050 --> 20:12.000
can we at least argue
about something new?

20:12.000 --> 20:13.170
Why does it always have
to be about what I do?

20:13.170 --> 20:15.090
- Do you take stock
of what you do?

20:15.090 --> 20:16.200
- I don't get
to take stock of it,

20:16.200 --> 20:18.230
not on a case-by-case basis.

20:18.230 --> 20:20.190
I have a client
charged with a crime.

20:20.190 --> 20:22.060
I take stock of the best way

20:22.060 --> 20:24.030
to prevent his getting
convicted of that crime.

20:24.030 --> 20:25.130
Here it's simple,

20:25.130 --> 20:27.090
attack the credibility
of the eyewitness.

20:27.090 --> 20:29.050
- A good man
would quit before doing

20:29.050 --> 20:31.180
what you're about to do.

20:31.180 --> 20:33.180
I'm sorry, it's true.

20:33.180 --> 20:35.030
She's 23 years old.

20:35.030 --> 20:36.100
She was raped by a rabbi.

20:36.100 --> 20:38.000
- Could you
keep your voice down?

20:38.000 --> 20:39.080
- Do you have any idea
how hard it must have been

20:39.080 --> 20:40.210
to come forward?

20:40.210 --> 20:42.100
Now, she's about
to be brutalized in a witness--

20:42.100 --> 20:43.150
- I'm not going
to brutalize anybody.

20:43.150 --> 20:44.220
- Of course you are.

20:44.220 --> 20:46.160
If you think that's the best way

20:46.160 --> 20:48.080
to prevent a conviction,
that's exactly what you do,

20:48.080 --> 20:51.140
and I'm telling you,
a good man would quit first.

20:51.140 --> 20:53.070
- I think it would be nice
to go to dinner.

20:53.070 --> 20:54.160
We go out, and you start.

20:54.160 --> 20:56.030
You start right back in again.

20:56.030 --> 20:57.210
You come--I'm a defense
attorney, Sharon.

20:57.210 --> 20:59.090
- The problem, Eugene,
is you keep saying you don't

20:59.090 --> 21:00.170
have a choice,
you have a choice.

21:00.170 --> 21:02.040
- And what's my choice:
quit my job?

21:02.040 --> 21:03.160
And do what, do what?

21:03.160 --> 21:05.020
And here's a flash,

21:05.020 --> 21:06.100
I'm well respected
in that courtroom.

21:06.100 --> 21:08.020
You know why?
Because I'm good.

21:08.020 --> 21:10.080
A judge sees Eugene Young walk
into his court

21:10.080 --> 21:11.190
and he knows
a good lawyer's in the room.

21:11.190 --> 21:13.110
And I mean,
I may not get respect from you,

21:13.110 --> 21:16.220
but I get it from them,
and I get it in that room.

21:16.220 --> 21:19.170
- Is that why you asked me
out to dinner tonight?

21:19.170 --> 21:20.170
To get my respect?

21:20.170 --> 21:24.090
- I asked you out because--

21:24.090 --> 21:28.070
Do you think these cases
are easy for me, Sharon?

21:28.070 --> 21:34.050
Some times--some times are
harder than others to be alone.

21:34.050 --> 21:39.050
That's--

21:39.050 --> 21:40.190
Let's just eat.

21:51.060 --> 21:54.200
- I remember the day
you graduated from law school.

21:54.200 --> 21:58.120
The smile on your face,
the plans in your heart.

21:58.120 --> 22:01.080
You remember that day, Eugene?

22:01.080 --> 22:04.110
We danced all night.

22:04.110 --> 22:09.170
When was the last time
you danced?

22:09.170 --> 22:11.040
It's not just

22:11.040 --> 22:15.120
that you don't
have the time anymore.

22:15.120 --> 22:18.170
There's no dance in you anymore.

22:18.170 --> 22:21.190
You're beginning
to rot a little inside.

22:21.190 --> 22:23.090
Maybe they don't tell you
that at work,

22:23.090 --> 22:28.040
maybe they don't see it,
but I see it.

22:28.040 --> 22:32.090
I know the man
I fell so in love with.

22:32.090 --> 22:37.090
I remember the
why you became a lawyer.

22:37.090 --> 22:39.020
The plans in your heart.

22:43.110 --> 22:45.130
- Can we please just eat?

22:49.120 --> 22:50.230
- Sure.

23:04.230 --> 23:07.130
- Mr. Young.

23:07.130 --> 23:09.090
- Ms. Reynolds,
my name is Eugene Young.

23:09.090 --> 23:10.160
I represent the defendant.

23:10.160 --> 23:13.080
- Yes, I know who you are.

23:13.080 --> 23:14.140
- A lot of people in this room.

23:14.140 --> 23:15.180
Stakes are high, I guess.

23:15.180 --> 23:17.150
A respected
rabbi is faced

23:17.150 --> 23:19.130
with losing his freedom,
his whole life,

23:19.130 --> 23:21.110
on the word of one witness, you.

23:21.110 --> 23:24.030
So I need
to ask you some questions.

23:24.030 --> 23:26.010
Are you a person of your word,
Ms. Reynolds?

23:26.010 --> 23:27.140
- Yes.

23:27.140 --> 23:29.030
- Do you consider yourself
an honorable person?

23:29.030 --> 23:30.190
- Objection.
- That's an unfair question?

23:30.190 --> 23:32.160
A defendant is allowed
to confront his accuser,

23:32.160 --> 23:34.140
but the question as to whether

23:34.140 --> 23:36.100
the accuser is honorable,
that's off-limits?

23:36.100 --> 23:38.130
- Counsel is trying
to intimidate the witness.

23:38.130 --> 23:40.040
- All right.
Mr. Bullock,

23:40.040 --> 23:42.200
I'll give defense counsel
some latitude here.

23:42.200 --> 23:46.120
Mr. Young, do not abuse it.

23:46.120 --> 23:51.050
- The question was,

23:51.050 --> 23:53.160
do you consider yourself
an honorable person?

23:53.160 --> 23:54.210
- Yes, I do.

23:54.210 --> 23:56.080
- Are you honest with people?

23:56.080 --> 23:57.220
- I believe I am.

23:57.220 --> 24:00.140
- In the 11 months
you were romantically involved

24:00.140 --> 24:01.160
with my client,

24:01.160 --> 24:03.150
you ever tell anybody?

24:03.150 --> 24:05.050
- Did I ever tell anybody?

24:05.050 --> 24:07.120
- Yes, your parents,
your brothers, best friend?

24:07.120 --> 24:10.020
Did you ever tell anybody
you were seeing Rabbi Jacobs?

24:10.020 --> 24:11.220
- No,
because if it ever came out,

24:11.220 --> 24:13.170
it would have meant
his losing his synagogue.

24:13.170 --> 24:15.130
- Did you ever
conceal it from anybody?

24:15.130 --> 24:18.200
Ever say, like you were going
to the movies with friends,

24:18.200 --> 24:20.200
and in actuality, you were going
to see my client?

24:20.200 --> 24:22.020
Did you ever say anything
like that?

24:22.020 --> 24:23.190
- I'm sure I did.

24:23.190 --> 24:25.140
- That would be a lie,
wouldn't it, Ms. Reynolds?

24:25.140 --> 24:27.150
- I wouldn't deny concealing
the affair, so did he.

24:27.150 --> 24:31.010
- What about this young man
you say you fell in love with?

24:31.010 --> 24:33.080
When you first began dating him,
did you tell him

24:33.080 --> 24:35.210
that you were in a relationship
with somebody else?

24:35.210 --> 24:37.130
- No, I didn't tell him.

24:37.130 --> 24:38.190
- That's one
of the bigger lies, isn't it?

24:38.190 --> 24:40.070
To be involved

24:40.070 --> 24:42.040
with two different people
at the same time--

24:42.040 --> 24:43.190
- Your Honor, if he's going
to go this far off, I think he--

24:43.190 --> 24:45.050
- A witness,
by taking the stand,

24:45.050 --> 24:46.170
puts her reputation
for truth in issue.

24:46.170 --> 24:48.040
- I'm going to rein you in,
Mr. Young.

24:48.040 --> 24:49.140
You made your point.

24:49.140 --> 24:51.130
Ms. Reynolds,
you say you met my client

24:51.130 --> 24:53.000
at a drug counseling program

24:53.000 --> 24:54.140
in which you both were
volunteers.

24:54.140 --> 24:56.070
Truth is,
you knew of him

24:56.070 --> 24:57.080
before then, correct?

24:57.080 --> 24:58.210
- Yes.
- In fact,

24:58.210 --> 25:00.080
one of the reasons
you went there to volunteer

25:00.080 --> 25:01.190
was because
Rabbi Jacobs was there

25:01.190 --> 25:03.000
and you wanted to meet him.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.110
- Yes, I don't deny that.

25:04.110 --> 25:06.040
He's a pretty famous rabbi,

25:06.040 --> 25:08.200
and I knew people who knew him,
and I wanted to meet him.

25:08.200 --> 25:10.040
- Well, that isn't quite

25:10.040 --> 25:11.150
the impression
you gave you the jury.

25:11.150 --> 25:13.060
From your direct testimony,

25:13.060 --> 25:15.030
it seemed like you happened
to meet him at a place

25:15.030 --> 25:16.130
you both worked.

25:16.130 --> 25:18.060
When the truth is
you went to this place,

25:18.060 --> 25:19.160
motivated to meet him.

25:19.160 --> 25:21.030
That's what really happened,
right?

25:21.030 --> 25:22.140
- I suppose.

25:22.140 --> 25:24.050
- Your Honor,
with this room being so crowded,

25:24.050 --> 25:26.040
it's kind of hot.

25:26.040 --> 25:28.120
With the court's permission,
I'd like to take off my jacket.

25:28.120 --> 25:29.210
- Permission granted.

25:29.210 --> 25:31.030
- Are you comfortable,
Ms. Reynolds?

25:31.030 --> 25:32.130
- I'm fine.

25:32.130 --> 25:34.160
- Because this may take a while.

25:39.160 --> 25:41.180
- Hey.

25:41.180 --> 25:43.130
How's it going?

25:43.130 --> 25:45.110
- He's just getting started.
He's going to town,

25:45.110 --> 25:47.150
Bobby, he's got that look
in his eye.

25:47.150 --> 25:50.060
- Did you ever tell my client
you wanted to be wealthy?

25:50.060 --> 25:52.070
- Doesn't everybody?
- Did you ever say to him

25:52.070 --> 25:53.220
that you'd have to marry money,

25:53.220 --> 25:56.010
since you had two years
junior college it was unlikely

25:56.010 --> 25:57.220
that you'd ever have
the kind of career

25:57.220 --> 26:00.040
that would make you rich,
did you say something like that?

26:00.040 --> 26:01.120
- I certainly never said

26:01.120 --> 26:02.230
that I would marry somebody
just for money.

26:02.230 --> 26:04.160
- Did you say for you ever
to be rich,

26:04.160 --> 26:06.070
that you would have
to marry into money?

26:06.070 --> 26:07.200
- You're taking that
out of context.

26:07.200 --> 26:09.180
- The question simply is,
did you say it?

26:09.180 --> 26:11.070
- Yes, I may have said
that once, but--

26:11.070 --> 26:12.080
- Thank you.
By the way,

26:12.080 --> 26:13.210
this new boyfriend of yours--

26:13.210 --> 26:15.160
- We're not together anymore.
- Thank you.

26:15.160 --> 26:17.050
That wasn't my question.

26:17.050 --> 26:19.000
Was he from a wealthy family?

26:19.000 --> 26:20.230
- That wasn't the reason
I fell in love with him.

26:20.230 --> 26:23.050
- I'll take that as a yes.
Wealthy family.

26:23.050 --> 26:24.180
- I really have to object.

26:24.180 --> 26:26.170
What does any of this have
to do with the rape?

26:26.170 --> 26:28.050
- I'll get there if you let me.

26:28.050 --> 26:30.000
- Speed it up.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.060
- You wanted to marry my client,
didn't you, Ms. Reynolds?

26:32.060 --> 26:34.040
- There was a time I did.

26:34.040 --> 26:36.080
- And you were frustrated over
the whole intermarriage issue,

26:36.080 --> 26:38.010
as you previously testified,

26:38.010 --> 26:39.150
you two even fought about it,
isn't that right?

26:39.150 --> 26:41.000
- Yes.
- And you said

26:41.000 --> 26:42.110
while this alleged rape
was taking place,

26:42.110 --> 26:44.050
you don't remember screaming.

26:44.050 --> 26:46.030
Truth is, you didn't scream,
isn't that right?

26:46.030 --> 26:48.000
- I don't remember screaming.

26:48.000 --> 26:49.140
That was my testimony.

26:49.140 --> 26:51.130
- Well, there were other people
working in the building,

26:51.130 --> 26:53.130
none of whom heard you scream.

26:53.130 --> 26:55.230
Wouldn't it be more probable
than not that you didn't scream,

26:55.230 --> 26:56.230
wouldn't you agree?

26:56.230 --> 26:58.110
- I suppose.

26:58.110 --> 27:02.170
- And you said
that he had your hands pinned

27:02.170 --> 27:05.140
with his hands.

27:05.140 --> 27:08.110
How did he get himself
inside of you?

27:08.110 --> 27:13.030
- He then
freed one of his hands to--

27:13.030 --> 27:14.200
I guess, guide himself.

27:14.200 --> 27:16.150
- So, you had a hand free.

27:16.150 --> 27:18.230
- Well, he still had me kind
of pinned with his shoulder.

27:18.230 --> 27:20.100
- His shoulder?
This is the first

27:20.100 --> 27:22.010
I'm hearing of a shoulder.

27:22.010 --> 27:24.090
Your police statement,
the statement to the doctor,

27:24.090 --> 27:25.180
even your direct testimony,

27:25.180 --> 27:27.060
you never made mention
of a shoulder.

27:27.060 --> 27:29.190
- He had me pinned
using his hands,

27:29.190 --> 27:32.000
then he released with one hand,

27:32.000 --> 27:33.100
and pushed down
with his shoulder.

27:33.100 --> 27:37.020
- How did he get your underwear
off?

27:37.020 --> 27:39.200
- I wasn't wearing underwear.

27:39.200 --> 27:42.140
- You weren't wearing underwear?

27:42.140 --> 27:44.190
- Well, I had
to this rather thin knit dress

27:44.190 --> 27:46.030
and the panty lines show and--

27:46.030 --> 27:47.160
- You went there
to break up with him

27:47.160 --> 27:48.220
but you didn't want
your panty line to show?

27:48.220 --> 27:50.160
- Objection.
- Withdrawn.

27:50.160 --> 27:52.190
After you finish having sexual
relations with my client--

27:52.190 --> 27:54.030
- It was a rape.

27:54.030 --> 27:55.190
It wasn't sexual relations.

27:55.190 --> 27:58.000
- After it was over,
what did you do then?

27:58.000 --> 27:59.060
- I went home.

27:59.060 --> 28:01.000
- You didn't run
out of the room,

28:01.000 --> 28:02.150
or did the two of you talk?

28:02.150 --> 28:03.210
- We talked.

28:03.210 --> 28:05.200
I told him
what he did was wrong.

28:05.200 --> 28:07.140
That he raped me.

28:07.140 --> 28:09.030
And then I left.

28:09.030 --> 28:10.130
- So you didn't run
out of the building?

28:10.130 --> 28:11.160
- No.

28:11.160 --> 28:13.010
- And you went home?
- Yes.

28:13.010 --> 28:15.160
- Did you call the police?
- Not at first.

28:15.160 --> 28:18.170
Because I thought,
"Who's ever gonna believe me?

28:18.170 --> 28:20.130
My word against his?"

28:20.130 --> 28:22.040
- Why didn't you think your word
would count for anything,

28:22.040 --> 28:23.100
Ms. Reynolds?

28:23.100 --> 28:24.150
Is there something wrong
with your word?

28:24.150 --> 28:26.060
- No, there isn't.

28:26.060 --> 28:27.230
- Did you ever go to a doctor
for an examination?

28:27.230 --> 28:29.060
- Yes.

28:29.060 --> 28:31.210
- He find any bruising
on your wrists?

28:31.210 --> 28:33.140
- No, but--
- He find any bruising

28:33.140 --> 28:36.030
on your thighs,
where my client supposedly

28:36.030 --> 28:39.080
pushed against you
with his knee?

28:39.080 --> 28:40.110
- No.

28:40.110 --> 28:43.000
I didn't have any bruises there.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.210
- Did you leave any marks
on Rabbi Jacobs?

28:45.210 --> 28:47.110
- Did I leave any marks?

28:47.110 --> 28:48.230
- Well, you had a hand free,
did you scratch him,

28:48.230 --> 28:50.110
or hit him, anything?

28:50.110 --> 28:51.210
- No.

28:51.210 --> 28:52.210
- You didn't do any
of those things?

28:52.210 --> 28:54.140
- I just tried to push him off.

28:54.140 --> 28:56.020
- Well, this wasn't a rape,
was it, Ms. Reynolds?

28:56.020 --> 28:57.170
- Yes, it was.
- You were angry at my client

28:57.170 --> 28:59.060
for refusing to consider
marrying you, weren't you?

28:59.060 --> 29:00.180
- As I said,
we fought some, but--

29:00.180 --> 29:02.120
- This is payback time,
isn't it, Ms. Reynolds?

29:02.120 --> 29:03.160
- What?
- Objection.

29:03.160 --> 29:04.230
- Have you hired
a civil attorney

29:04.230 --> 29:06.050
to sue both the rabbi
and the temple?

29:06.050 --> 29:07.160
- Objection.
- Goes to motive.

29:07.160 --> 29:09.140
- I'll allow it.

29:09.140 --> 29:10.220
- Is that your attorney
sitting right there,

29:10.220 --> 29:12.140
Ms. Reynolds?
- Yes.

29:12.140 --> 29:14.200
- He's representing you
in a lawsuit against the temple.

29:14.200 --> 29:16.070
- You know this isn't
about money.

29:16.070 --> 29:17.180
- Move to strike, nonresponsive.

29:17.180 --> 29:19.070
- Sustained.

29:19.070 --> 29:21.070
- Did you once date a man
named Michael Anderson?

29:21.070 --> 29:22.160
- Yes.

29:22.160 --> 29:24.060
- You ended that relationship?
- Yes.

29:24.060 --> 29:26.090
- Was one of the reasons
his lack of career ambition?

29:26.090 --> 29:27.210
- I told him that, yes, as in--

29:27.210 --> 29:29.110
- Thank you,
you answered the question.

29:29.110 --> 29:30.190
- There were a lot
of different reasons--

29:30.190 --> 29:33.230
- You answered the question.

29:33.230 --> 29:36.060
Is this a picture of you
in your high school yearbook?

29:36.060 --> 29:37.200
- Yes.

29:37.200 --> 29:41.010
- Could you read the caption
under "life goals"?

29:41.010 --> 29:42.170
- "To be rich,

29:42.170 --> 29:44.220
to be happy, to travel."

29:44.220 --> 29:47.130
- Do you have a friend
by the name of Susan Levine?

29:47.130 --> 29:48.200
- Yes.
- In fact,

29:48.200 --> 29:50.220
you told her
about your relationship

29:50.220 --> 29:53.020
with Rabbi Jacobs, didn't you?

29:53.020 --> 29:57.150
- Oh, I did tell her
at the very beginning, I forgot.

29:57.150 --> 29:58.210
It was under another context,

29:58.210 --> 30:00.080
it was when we first
started seeing--

30:00.080 --> 30:02.100
- So, you did tell somebody else
about it.

30:02.100 --> 30:04.220
That previous statement,
under oath, that was a lie.

30:04.220 --> 30:06.130
- It was a mistake.
- Got it.

30:06.130 --> 30:08.020
I guess mistakes happen.

30:08.020 --> 30:10.190
Is that the only mistake
so far in your testimony?

30:10.190 --> 30:11.220
- Yes.

30:11.220 --> 30:16.050
- Lucky I caught it, I guess.

30:16.050 --> 30:18.050
I'm done for now.

30:27.090 --> 30:29.180
- Ms. Reynolds,
when you went to the doctor,

30:29.180 --> 30:31.110
did he find any bruising?

30:31.110 --> 30:34.220
- Yes.
He found some vaginal bruising.

30:34.220 --> 30:36.220
- Thank you.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
- Did the doctor
find that bruising

30:47.000 --> 30:51.080
to be conclusive
of nonconsensual intercourse?

30:51.080 --> 30:52.200
- No.

30:52.200 --> 30:54.140
- Thank you.

31:01.010 --> 31:02.100
- Your Honor,
the Commonwealth

31:02.100 --> 31:03.210
would like to call
one more witness

31:03.210 --> 31:05.160
who is not on our list.

31:05.160 --> 31:07.050
- Objection.

31:15.040 --> 31:17.090
- Sheila Keenan.

31:17.090 --> 31:20.010
Three years ago she was raped
by Rabbi Jacobs.

31:20.010 --> 31:21.150
There was an out-of-court
settlement,

31:21.150 --> 31:24.130
coupled with an agreement
for her to keep silent.

31:24.130 --> 31:26.080
I would like
to call her to rehabilitate

31:26.080 --> 31:29.090
Ms. Reynolds' testimony.

31:29.090 --> 31:30.080
- Mr. Young.

31:34.010 --> 31:35.120
Mr. Young.

31:35.120 --> 31:37.030
- Uh...

31:37.030 --> 31:40.130
- Your Honor, a prior bad acts
in a criminal case,

31:40.130 --> 31:42.060
that's not even close
to being admissible.

31:42.060 --> 31:43.180
- I will be offering
to show pattern--

31:43.180 --> 31:45.040
- What pattern, two?

31:45.040 --> 31:46.220
Even if two made a pattern--
- May I finish?

31:46.220 --> 31:48.200
- We don't need
to hear you finish.

31:48.200 --> 31:50.180
That witness
would be so prejudicial, she--

31:50.180 --> 31:52.110
- I understand you don't like
this, but that does not mean--

31:52.110 --> 31:55.000
- I don't like it either,
Mr. Bullock.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.140
The only thing
we'd accomplish

31:56.140 --> 31:58.150
by bringing in that witness
is a guaranteed appeal.

31:58.150 --> 32:01.000
Even if you got a conviction,
it would just be overturned.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.160
- Not necessarily.

32:02.160 --> 32:04.060
If we limit the scope
of the questions, there's no--

32:04.060 --> 32:06.070
- Sorry, no chance.

32:06.070 --> 32:10.120
Is that it?

32:10.120 --> 32:11.120
Good.

32:11.120 --> 32:13.010
We close tomorrow afternoon.

32:21.140 --> 32:23.050
- You weren't going
to tell me that little detail?

32:23.050 --> 32:24.160
- Pursuant to the court
settlement,

32:24.160 --> 32:26.060
she's not allowed
to speak to anybody.

32:26.060 --> 32:27.150
- You were allowed to tell me.
You left that out.

32:27.150 --> 32:29.140
- I didn't rape her, either.

32:29.140 --> 32:31.010
Things just got out of control.

32:31.010 --> 32:33.050
- How much did you pay
this Keenan woman?

32:33.050 --> 32:34.110
- I'm not sure.

32:34.110 --> 32:36.130
- You're not sure?

32:36.130 --> 32:39.080
- The synagogue handled it.

32:39.080 --> 32:40.190
- Next on the agenda is--

32:40.190 --> 32:43.150
- I guess I am naive
after all, Mr. Lewis.

32:43.150 --> 32:45.010
I didn't think
it was board business

32:45.010 --> 32:46.100
to buy off rape victims.

32:46.100 --> 32:48.040
How deep does that fund go,
Mr. Lewis?

32:48.040 --> 32:50.020
- Now hold on--
- No, you hold on.

32:50.020 --> 32:51.150
I'm sure
he's a good rabbi,

32:51.150 --> 32:54.030
fills the seats,
generates a good cash flow,

32:54.030 --> 32:56.000
you get to use
the best wood for your pews,

32:56.000 --> 32:57.200
build the fanciest
temple in town,

32:57.200 --> 32:59.130
and when he commits
a crime or two,

32:59.130 --> 33:01.020
you can pay top dollar
to get him off,

33:01.020 --> 33:02.090
but here's what you don't know--

33:02.090 --> 33:04.170
- Mr. Young--
- Shh.

33:04.170 --> 33:07.010
I'm talking now.

33:07.010 --> 33:10.000
When it's me you hire,
you tell me the truth.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.050
You tell me everything
you think I might want to know.

33:12.050 --> 33:14.030
You hide facts for me, I quit.

33:14.030 --> 33:16.000
You got that?

33:16.000 --> 33:18.180
You understand me?

33:18.180 --> 33:21.140
- Are you finished?

33:21.140 --> 33:23.000
I'm an attorney, myself,
Mr. Young,

33:23.000 --> 33:24.210
so please don't lecture me.

33:24.210 --> 33:28.040
When you take on a case,
you take on a duty.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.190
You have no rights,
Mr. Young.

33:29.190 --> 33:32.070
The client has no obligation
to tell you everything.

33:32.070 --> 33:34.100
What he decides
to tell you is his choice alone.

33:34.100 --> 33:36.200
You take what he gives you,
and you make the best of it.

33:36.200 --> 33:38.040
We gave you your hand,
Mr. Young,

33:38.040 --> 33:39.180
you've played it very nicely.

33:39.180 --> 33:41.030
And don't barge
in here threatening to quit,

33:41.030 --> 33:42.220
because the judge
would never let you out.

33:42.220 --> 33:45.090
- I could quit just the same
and take the contempt finding.

33:45.090 --> 33:46.170
- It's not in your character
to quit.

33:49.140 --> 33:53.020
You don't think
we bothered to check you out?

33:53.020 --> 33:54.080
Now, please.

33:54.080 --> 33:56.090
Attend to your closing argument.

33:56.090 --> 33:57.180
From where I sit,

33:57.180 --> 33:59.040
this whole trial
comes down to summations,

33:59.040 --> 34:01.000
and I guarantee you

34:01.000 --> 34:02.190
Gavin Bullock is working on his.

34:12.219 --> 34:14.159
- You think you did good
in there, Counsel?

34:14.159 --> 34:15.230
You think you did good in there?

34:15.230 --> 34:17.080
- I asked you
to get away from me.

34:17.080 --> 34:18.170
- I won't be staying
away from you.

34:18.170 --> 34:20.040
Go in there
and give your closing now.

34:20.040 --> 34:21.139
- You want to take a shot at me?
- Yeah.

34:21.139 --> 34:23.020
I want to take it right now.
- Come on!

34:23.020 --> 34:24.199
- Eugene, Eugene, Eugene.
- Interrogate me!

34:24.199 --> 34:26.100
- For God's sake,
this isn't time

34:26.100 --> 34:27.230
for you to lose your focus.

34:27.230 --> 34:29.090
- What are you doing here?
- You got to go in there

34:29.090 --> 34:30.159
and hit a home run,
if you don't--

34:30.159 --> 34:31.179
- Are you checking up on me,
Jimmy?

34:31.179 --> 34:34.050
- Yeah, Eugene, I am.

34:34.050 --> 34:36.090
- You can tell Bobby I'm ready.

34:41.170 --> 34:43.110
- Mr. Young.

34:48.030 --> 34:50.040
- When this trial began,
I think a lot of people

34:50.040 --> 34:53.010
wanted to believe Terri Reynolds
for two reasons.

34:53.010 --> 34:56.179
First, it's become kind of
a pastime in this country

34:56.179 --> 34:59.040
to watch people fall
from high places.

34:59.040 --> 35:01.020
It's almost
as if it's a spectator sport

35:01.020 --> 35:02.150
as far as the media goes,

35:02.150 --> 35:06.090
and here, you have one
of the most respected rabbis

35:06.090 --> 35:07.170
in New England.

35:07.170 --> 35:09.110
A rabbi's rabbi, if you will.

35:09.110 --> 35:12.010
For him to be accused of rape,

35:12.010 --> 35:16.200
there's just something delicious
about that, isn't there?

35:16.200 --> 35:21.170
Second, there's something
so seemingly

35:21.170 --> 35:24.150
innocent about Terri Reynolds,
and good.

35:24.150 --> 35:27.040
And good people
don't make up lies like this.

35:27.040 --> 35:29.100
We all want to believe that.
I want to believe it.

35:29.100 --> 35:31.050
She could be your daughter,
your sister.

35:31.050 --> 35:34.010
She's just not going to make
something like this up.

35:34.010 --> 35:35.100
Well,
I'm not going to stand up here

35:35.100 --> 35:37.110
and tell you
I know Terri Reynolds.

35:37.110 --> 35:38.190
I don't.

35:38.190 --> 35:40.130
Neither does
the district attorney.

35:40.130 --> 35:41.170
He doesn't know her.

35:41.170 --> 35:43.080
Nor do any of you.

35:43.080 --> 35:46.150
All you get to do here
is weigh her credibility.

35:46.150 --> 35:48.160
And here's what the evidence
tells you about that,

35:48.160 --> 35:53.020
and by evidence,
I mean her very own testimony.

35:53.020 --> 35:54.100
She is a woman

35:54.100 --> 35:56.030
who admittedly wants
to be wealthy,

35:56.030 --> 35:57.230
going all the way
back to high school,

35:57.230 --> 36:00.220
when she listed
as a life goal to be rich.

36:00.220 --> 36:03.040
She's a woman
who wanted to marry my client,

36:03.040 --> 36:05.050
testified she was
angry with him.

36:05.050 --> 36:06.160
Well, one way
to punish him

36:06.160 --> 36:09.000
and to get rich
at the same time, cry rape.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.190
She's already got the civil
attorney in place.

36:11.190 --> 36:14.050
A criminal conviction here,

36:14.050 --> 36:17.080
that's money
in the bank, isn't it?

36:17.080 --> 36:19.180
The evidence
on her truthfulness:

36:19.180 --> 36:21.070
She's in love
with one man,

36:21.070 --> 36:22.200
but doesn't tell him,
"By the way,

36:22.200 --> 36:24.170
I'm seeing somebody else."

36:24.170 --> 36:27.130
She testified
that she didn't tell anybody

36:27.130 --> 36:30.080
about her relationship
with the Rabbi Jacobs, and then,

36:30.080 --> 36:32.230
when confronted about the truth
about telling her friend,

36:32.230 --> 36:34.210
she says, "Oh, yeah,
I forgot about that."

36:34.210 --> 36:36.160
Is she truthful?
I don't know.

36:36.160 --> 36:38.110
Like I said, I don't know her.

36:38.110 --> 36:42.130
Neither do any of you.

36:42.130 --> 36:45.140
What about the facts
of the case itself?

36:45.140 --> 36:48.130
She's being raped;
she doesn't scream.

36:48.130 --> 36:50.110
No screams, no bruises,

36:50.110 --> 36:52.210
no calling the police,
no fleeing the scene:

36:52.210 --> 36:54.160
does this sound
like a rape to you?

36:54.160 --> 36:56.070
Would she make it up after,

36:56.070 --> 36:58.150
as a scheme, just to get rich?

36:58.150 --> 37:00.120
I don't know.

37:00.120 --> 37:03.090
As I said, a part of us
wants to believe her,

37:03.090 --> 37:04.150
but when we examine the facts,

37:04.150 --> 37:05.150
can we?

37:05.150 --> 37:07.120
I don't know.

37:07.120 --> 37:09.100
I don't know her.

37:09.100 --> 37:10.190
In fact,

37:10.190 --> 37:12.160
if there's
one uncontroverted truth

37:12.160 --> 37:14.060
that we can be certain of,

37:14.060 --> 37:19.110
it's that none
of us here knows her.

37:19.110 --> 37:21.000
That we know.

37:24.060 --> 37:26.070
That,

37:26.070 --> 37:27.230
and that she wants to be rich.

37:41.120 --> 37:45.100
- It's not easy
being a rape victim these days.

37:45.100 --> 37:48.100
Because the trial system,

37:48.100 --> 37:52.000
it's no longer
about arriving at the truth.

37:52.000 --> 37:55.110
Believe it or not,
that used to be the idea.

37:55.110 --> 37:58.220
It's about winning and losing.

37:58.220 --> 38:00.090
Now, I'm here to win,
I admit it,

38:00.090 --> 38:03.130
and so is defense counsel.

38:03.130 --> 38:08.140
Winning means that if
you don't have the facts,

38:08.140 --> 38:10.210
you attack the one who does.

38:10.210 --> 38:12.110
This is
why Mr. Young

38:12.110 --> 38:15.080
has focused himself
on getting Terri Reynolds.

38:15.080 --> 38:19.080
He can't offer any testimonial
or physical evidence

38:19.080 --> 38:21.100
to dispute what she says,

38:21.100 --> 38:26.050
so he'll just get her.

38:26.050 --> 38:28.150
We're talking about a rape,
ladies and gentlemen,

38:28.150 --> 38:32.100
and he's dredging up
her high school yearbook.

38:32.100 --> 38:34.020
We're talking
about a man

38:34.020 --> 38:37.230
physically forcing himself
inside a young woman,

38:37.230 --> 38:42.010
and he's serving up
her career ambitions.

38:42.010 --> 38:43.160
He has no defense.

38:43.160 --> 38:46.050
He put on no defense.

38:46.050 --> 38:48.020
He chose, instead,

38:48.020 --> 38:50.150
to rape her again,
in this courtroom,

38:50.150 --> 38:53.120
and he's asked you
to be a part of it.

38:53.120 --> 38:55.160
Now, this has got to stop.

38:55.160 --> 38:58.090
She was raped,
for God's sake.

38:58.090 --> 39:00.190
He pinned her to the ground

39:00.190 --> 39:04.130
and performed a vile act
of violence against her.

39:04.130 --> 39:09.060
That is her testimony,
and it goes uncontradicted.

39:09.060 --> 39:11.080
You listened to her.

39:11.080 --> 39:14.040
Did she sound like a liar?

39:14.040 --> 39:20.050
Did she seem like someone
who was only looking for money?

39:20.050 --> 39:23.190
Defense counsel is right
about one thing.

- I did no such thing.
- Oh, come on.

40:11.100 --> 40:13.220
He says we can't offer
testimonial evidence,

40:13.220 --> 40:16.040
he says the rapist gets
to sit quietly in his chair,

40:16.040 --> 40:17.220
he says we put on no defense.
- You didn't.

40:17.220 --> 40:20.000
- He was commenting
on the defendant not testifying,

40:20.000 --> 40:21.060
which he isn't allowed to do.

40:21.060 --> 40:22.170
- I am allowed
to say he put on--

40:22.170 --> 40:24.120
- The defendant has the right--
- All right.

40:24.120 --> 40:27.040
- It's grounds for a mistrial.
- You want a mistrial?

40:27.040 --> 40:29.100
- I want a stronger instruction
than the one you gave.

40:29.100 --> 40:30.130
- Come on.

40:30.130 --> 40:31.140
I gave an instruction.

If I gave it any stronger,

I'd have been
hanging out a flag.

what the hell was that?

gives you the right to claim

40:37.230 --> 40:39.130

- Counsel.

40:44.110 --> 40:46.180
I think
you're overreacting here.

40:46.180 --> 40:48.170
Maybe you should take a walk
around the building,

that's got you this angry.

40:52.150 --> 40:54.130
He argued
that my client didn't testify.

40:54.130 --> 40:56.030

I don't believe
he crossed the line.

40:58.030 --> 41:00.220
I believe I protected you
with an instruction.

You made your objection
on the record,

Richard Jacobs, not guilty.

- The jury reached its decision.

42:50.200 --> 42:52.020
I'm satisfied justice--

42:52.020 --> 42:53.080
- There's some speculation

42:53.080 --> 42:54.150
that she was trying
to get pregnant.

42:54.150 --> 42:55.190
Do you have an opinion on that?

- No.

what about Rabbi Jacobs?
