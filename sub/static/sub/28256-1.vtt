01:02.395 --> 01:04.061
<i>It's simple at first.</i>

01:04.063 --> 01:06.529
<i>Home is the only place
you know.</i>

01:06.531 --> 01:08.600
<i>And everyone there
is your family.</i>

01:10.203 --> 01:12.735
<i>My first home
was full of cats.</i>

01:13.972 --> 01:15.338
<i>And I'm a dog.</i>

01:18.510 --> 01:21.845
<i>Cats had sharp claws
and made a funny tummy sound</i>

01:21.847 --> 01:23.246
<i>when they were happy.</i>

01:27.118 --> 01:30.220
<i>The kittens had a mother cat.</i>

01:30.222 --> 01:32.424
<i>And I had a mother dog.</i>

01:37.162 --> 01:41.201
<i>I couldn't imagine that
life could get any better.</i>

01:45.837 --> 01:48.774
<i>As I grew, we made
a home together.</i>

01:51.376 --> 01:53.609
<i>We were happy</i>

01:53.611 --> 01:54.813
<i>for a while.</i>

01:59.284 --> 02:01.285
Oh, wow.
Look at all of 'em.

02:01.287 --> 02:02.553
You didn't tell me
there were so many.

02:02.555 --> 02:03.621
Just grab 'em!

02:05.290 --> 02:06.356
- Hey!
- Found one. I got one over here.

02:06.358 --> 02:07.525
Geez, they're fast.

02:07.527 --> 02:09.192
I got one.

02:09.193 --> 02:11.294
- Over there. Over there.
- Come here.

02:11.296 --> 02:13.463
Hey, hey. There's dogs here, too.

02:13.465 --> 02:15.566
Brother!

02:15.568 --> 02:16.836
A whole bunch
of 'em back here.

02:19.170 --> 02:21.272
- Got another one.
- Sister!

02:21.274 --> 02:23.173
Got it.

02:24.643 --> 02:25.878
There's
a full-grown pit bull.

02:32.116 --> 02:33.986
Here we go.

02:35.722 --> 02:36.689
Easy.

02:38.390 --> 02:39.658
Easy.

02:45.997 --> 02:47.099
Got her.

02:47.599 --> 02:48.832
Mother!

02:50.635 --> 02:52.204
- I'm going out.
- Come on.

02:53.139 --> 02:54.340
Get a bigger crate.

02:59.144 --> 03:00.847
Coming out.

03:07.986 --> 03:10.853
Mother?

03:15.193 --> 03:17.462
<i>I never saw her again.</i>

03:38.783 --> 03:40.518
<i>I don't know what
would have happened to me</i>

03:40.520 --> 03:41.818
<i>without Mother Cat.</i>

03:55.835 --> 03:57.403
<i>And day by day,</i>

04:00.004 --> 04:01.540
<i>little by little,</i>

04:02.875 --> 04:05.645
<i>Mother Cat became my mother.</i>

04:13.852 --> 04:16.320
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:16.322 --> 04:18.725
It's just here.

04:20.425 --> 04:23.728
Okay. We left work early
so we could be basically,

04:23.730 --> 04:25.596
what, breaking and entering?

04:25.598 --> 04:27.264
It's not breaking
and entering, Olivia.

04:27.266 --> 04:29.533
It's criminal trespass.
There's a difference.

04:29.535 --> 04:32.469
Okay, so, like, two years
in prison instead of six. Got it.

04:32.471 --> 04:34.271
- I'm good, I'm good.
- Anyway, come on.

04:34.273 --> 04:37.541
Can't say that a guy
rescuing kittens isn't hot.

04:37.543 --> 04:40.409
Oh, I'm not saying that.
I'm just saying you're not hot.

04:40.411 --> 04:43.247
Oh, thanks. Here.

04:43.249 --> 04:45.582
- Come on. They're under here.
- Okay. Seriously?

04:45.584 --> 04:47.450
Lucas, I'm not going
in that hole.

04:47.452 --> 04:49.252
Well, you're
the animal rescue volunteer.

04:49.254 --> 04:50.553
- Okay.
- You don't have to crawl in.

04:50.555 --> 04:53.257
Just take a look.

04:53.259 --> 04:55.591
- Wow. There's so many of 'em.
- Yeah.

04:55.593 --> 04:57.760
Apparently,
Animal Control came,

04:57.762 --> 04:59.829
but they didn't get 'em all.

04:59.831 --> 05:02.565
And now, the builder says he's
gonna tear down the whole block,

05:02.567 --> 05:05.002
cats or no cats.

05:05.004 --> 05:08.171
<i>Men took my dog family,
but this man named Lucas was different.</i>

05:08.173 --> 05:10.207
- <i>He came every day...</i>
- Hey.

05:10.209 --> 05:12.245
<i>And the cats trusted him.</i>

05:14.579 --> 05:16.781
Come on.

05:16.783 --> 05:19.117
<i>And before I could even
think, my paws were moving.</i>

05:19.817 --> 05:20.819
Wait!

05:23.956 --> 05:26.656
Lucas!
Look, a puppy!

05:26.658 --> 05:27.794
Oh, my God.

05:30.295 --> 05:33.699
Hey. What are you doing
here, baby... Girl?

05:34.365 --> 05:36.699
Hey.

05:36.701 --> 05:38.469
<i>And he
tasted good, too.</i>

05:38.471 --> 05:40.603
She is really cute.

05:40.605 --> 05:42.738
- Hi.
- Hey.

05:42.740 --> 05:45.509
It will not be hard
finding you a home.

05:45.511 --> 05:47.510
Well, wait.

05:47.512 --> 05:49.445
I mean,
you saw how she ran right to me.

05:49.447 --> 05:51.781
Maybe that's a sign that her
home's supposed to be with me.

05:51.783 --> 05:54.683
Lucas, you cannot
take care of a dog, okay?

05:54.685 --> 05:58.154
What do you do when you
go to school or the VA?

05:58.156 --> 06:00.192
Listen, I actually
live with my mom.

06:02.226 --> 06:04.495
It's not how it sounds.
It... She's a veteran.

06:04.497 --> 06:06.562
You might have
seen her at the VA.

06:06.564 --> 06:08.197
- Terri Ray?
- Yeah.

06:08.199 --> 06:10.466
Well, she isn't able
to hold down a job just yet,

06:10.468 --> 06:13.437
so, she's at home
even when I'm not.

06:13.439 --> 06:17.106
Listen, maybe a puppy
would be good for her, too.

06:17.108 --> 06:19.608
<i>Nothing had ever felt
as good as being held by him.</i>

06:19.610 --> 06:21.611
She does really seem
to like you a lot.

06:23.115 --> 06:24.584
What do you see in him
that I don't, puppy?

06:28.853 --> 06:31.021
Hey, you!
Get out of there!

06:31.023 --> 06:32.154
- Go, go, go.
- Go, go. Keep going.

06:32.156 --> 06:33.723
Private property!

06:38.930 --> 06:40.397
- I'll see you later, okay?
- All right.

06:40.399 --> 06:41.768
- Yeah. Bye.
- Call me.

06:49.675 --> 06:51.541
Whoa! Oh!

06:51.543 --> 06:55.211
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

06:55.213 --> 06:58.582
I think I'm gonna
call her Bella.

06:58.584 --> 07:00.584
Honey, you know
we can't have a puppy.

07:00.586 --> 07:02.084
Our lease says no pets.

07:02.086 --> 07:04.187
They say a dog
is good for depression.

07:04.189 --> 07:08.692
- Who says that?
- Oh, I'm pretty sure somebody says that.

07:10.362 --> 07:11.762
Is this gonna be one
of those things

07:11.764 --> 07:13.997
I say is a terrible idea
and you do it, anyway?

07:13.999 --> 07:16.701
Yeah. And who do you suppose
I learned that from?

07:20.372 --> 07:22.808
<i>Lucas and I
played the best games.</i>

07:24.242 --> 07:27.010
Bella, get the ball.

07:27.012 --> 07:28.548
<i>We played Get the Ball.</i>

07:35.922 --> 07:36.986
Stop.

07:36.988 --> 07:38.421
<i>We played Stop.</i>

07:38.423 --> 07:41.026
Stop, Bella.
I have to study.

07:44.663 --> 07:45.664
Here.

07:47.466 --> 07:48.733
Have my blanket.

07:51.536 --> 07:54.605
<i>It smelled amazing.
Just like Lucas.</i>

07:59.411 --> 08:01.745
<i>We played Don't Chew Shoes.</i>

08:01.747 --> 08:03.883
Bella. Don't chew shoes.

08:14.158 --> 08:17.159
<i>And there was
my favorite game of all.</i>

08:18.598 --> 08:20.964
What? What do you want?

08:20.966 --> 08:22.802
I'm trying to...

08:24.836 --> 08:26.235
Oh.

08:26.237 --> 08:31.808
Do you want
a tiny piece of cheese?

08:31.810 --> 08:33.708
<i>Tiny Piece of Cheese
filled me</i>

08:33.711 --> 08:35.712
- <i>with such a strong feeling.</i>
- There you go.

08:35.714 --> 08:39.549
<i>Like I was safe and happy
and warm, all at once.</i>

08:39.551 --> 08:41.482
<i>It was love.</i>

08:41.485 --> 08:43.652
I've gotta go, gotta go,
gotta go, gotta go!

08:43.654 --> 08:45.357
I'm so late.

08:49.193 --> 08:52.061
Gotta go to work.
Bye, Bella.

08:52.063 --> 08:54.998
<i>The one game I
didn't like was Go to Work.</i>

08:55.000 --> 08:57.133
Be good.

08:57.135 --> 08:59.069
<i>My Lucas blanket
kept me company,</i>

08:59.071 --> 09:02.408
<i>but it wasn't the same
as the real Lucas.</i>

09:05.009 --> 09:07.176
- <i>I still had my cat family.</i>
- Slow down there.

09:07.178 --> 09:09.278
<i>And Lucas became</i>

09:09.280 --> 09:10.379
- <i>part of that family, too.</i>
- No, this is not for you, Bella.

09:10.381 --> 09:11.082
This is for the cats.
Come here.

09:14.119 --> 09:15.450
See 'em?

09:15.452 --> 09:17.653
Mother Cat!

09:17.655 --> 09:20.656
<i>I love Mother Cat,
and I love being Bella.</i>

09:22.660 --> 09:25.027
Come on.
We're going home.

09:25.029 --> 09:26.329
As you were, cats.

09:26.331 --> 09:27.564
- See you tomorrow.
- All right.

09:27.566 --> 09:29.833
Bedtime, Bella. Come on.

09:29.835 --> 09:32.736
<i>And at the end of
every day, we played...</i>

09:32.738 --> 09:34.872
Sit. You ready for your

09:34.874 --> 09:37.543
- tiny piece of cheese?
- <i>...Tiny Piece of Cheese.</i>

09:45.283 --> 09:47.485
All right. On your blanket.
Come on.

09:54.293 --> 09:56.026
Night, Bella.

09:56.028 --> 09:59.731
<i>Lucas was my person,
and I was his dog.</i>

10:01.399 --> 10:03.802
<i>I was home.</i>

10:05.370 --> 10:06.770
<i>Whenever Lucas was playing</i>

10:06.772 --> 10:08.238
- <i>Go to Work...</i>
- Good girl.

10:08.240 --> 10:10.406
<i>...I would take
Mom for a walk.</i>

10:10.408 --> 10:13.009
- What is it, honey?
- It's that squirrel again!

10:13.011 --> 10:14.676
I have to have
that squirrel.

10:14.678 --> 10:16.512
It's getting away!

10:16.514 --> 10:18.515
- Bella. No, Bella.
- Oh, it's right there!

10:18.517 --> 10:19.748
Come on, girl.
No squirrel chasing.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.785
Come on, Bella.
Come on, girl.

10:21.787 --> 10:23.420
<i>I loved Mom,
but she just didn't understand</i>

10:23.422 --> 10:24.923
- <i>how to hunt squirrels.</i>
- Good.

10:26.357 --> 10:28.257
Nice dog.

10:28.259 --> 10:30.962
Sorry. Didn't mean
to startle you.

10:31.897 --> 10:34.131
I'm Gunter Beckenbauer.

10:34.133 --> 10:35.835
Those are
my houses there.

10:37.936 --> 10:39.469
What do you want,
Mr. Beckenbauer?

10:39.471 --> 10:42.137
Oh, please,
call me "Gunter."

10:42.139 --> 10:43.906
<i>I knew that smell.</i>

10:43.908 --> 10:46.008
- <i>And I knew this wasn't good.</i>
- Look.

10:46.010 --> 10:47.743
I know it's your son
who's been calling

10:47.745 --> 10:49.579
the county building authority
about the stupid cats,

10:49.581 --> 10:51.648
which I got rid of.

10:51.650 --> 10:53.249
I've lost
the whole summer now,

10:53.251 --> 10:54.783
so, could you please
just ask him to back off?

10:54.785 --> 10:57.087
My son isn't gonna back off,
Mr. Beckenbauer,

10:57.089 --> 10:59.289
because there are still cats
living there.

10:59.291 --> 11:00.791
Animal Control
says there's not.

11:00.793 --> 11:03.028
Animal Control is lying,
and so are you.

11:05.596 --> 11:07.631
What kind of dog
is that? Pit bull?

11:07.633 --> 11:11.470
We don't know. We found her living
with the cats you say aren't there.

11:12.671 --> 11:15.070
What I'm trying to say, lady,

11:15.072 --> 11:18.276
is that you and your boy do
not want to go to war with me.

11:22.514 --> 11:25.415
War? What do you
know about war?

11:25.417 --> 11:26.983
Okay.

11:26.985 --> 11:28.651
But let the record
show that I tried

11:28.653 --> 11:31.021
to settle this friendly,
and you're the one pushing it.

11:31.023 --> 11:35.324
No, the record shows that you came
here and said we were going to war.

11:38.429 --> 11:40.530
Come on, Bella, relax.

11:40.532 --> 11:44.070
Relax.
Let's go do your business.

11:46.837 --> 11:49.738
What is it? Cold, wet.

11:49.740 --> 11:51.141
Ice cream!

11:51.143 --> 11:53.376
- Ice cream is falling from the sky!
- Bella.

11:53.378 --> 11:55.811
It's snow.

11:55.813 --> 11:59.681
It's just snow.
Now, do your business.

12:10.528 --> 12:12.195
What? What?

12:21.907 --> 12:23.442
Go on, go on.

12:24.375 --> 12:25.809
Come on, go on. Go on.

12:27.312 --> 12:28.677
Go on.

12:36.254 --> 12:38.321
Go on. Yeah.

12:38.323 --> 12:41.291
- <i>I loved Snow Do Your Business.</i>
- Go on.

12:48.633 --> 12:50.867
- Yay! Lucas is home!
- Hello.

12:50.869 --> 12:52.301
Hi. Hey.

12:52.303 --> 12:54.070
<i>When Lucas came home,</i>

12:54.072 --> 12:58.041
- <i>I felt joy in my whole body.</i>
- Hello. Hello.

12:58.043 --> 13:00.377
- What's that?
- I don't know.

13:00.379 --> 13:02.014
It was taped to the door.

13:06.717 --> 13:08.151
Oh, no.

13:08.153 --> 13:09.953
It's the landlord.

13:09.955 --> 13:12.055
He's coming tomorrow
to check the faucet.

13:12.057 --> 13:14.724
But I have therapy
and you have to work.

13:14.726 --> 13:17.060
What will we do with Bella?

13:17.062 --> 13:19.932
She can't be in the house
when he's here.

13:22.701 --> 13:24.637
Just stick to the plan.

13:26.404 --> 13:28.872
If they see her,
you're gonna get fired.

13:28.874 --> 13:30.909
Don't worry.

13:41.219 --> 13:43.155
All clear. Hurry up.

13:46.457 --> 13:49.127
<i>That day,
I got to do Go to Work.</i>

13:59.638 --> 14:03.172
Bella. Okay,
stay here. Stay.

14:03.174 --> 14:05.541
<i>I didn't like Stay.</i>

14:05.543 --> 14:07.679
No barks. Understand?

14:11.316 --> 14:13.217
I'll come check on you
in a little while.

14:13.219 --> 14:15.151
You can't get caught, okay, Bella?

14:15.153 --> 14:17.520
Wait, hold on.
Where are you going?

14:17.522 --> 14:18.958
No barks.

14:22.961 --> 14:25.460
I definitely do not
get this game.

14:31.470 --> 14:33.205
Lucas?

14:39.510 --> 14:41.677
PT reports
he's not responding,

14:41.679 --> 14:44.046
and recommends going
to twice a day.

14:44.048 --> 14:46.681
Okay, well, we can try, but if he...

14:48.186 --> 14:50.520
Um, Dr. Gann,

14:50.522 --> 14:52.756
would you excuse me?

14:57.662 --> 14:59.732
- Hey, Valerie, I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

15:03.067 --> 15:04.934
Yes, I was barking,
but it worked.

15:04.936 --> 15:06.368
- Here you are.
- No.

15:06.370 --> 15:07.538
Is that the game?

15:08.340 --> 15:09.705
Bella?

15:09.707 --> 15:11.842
- Oh, my gosh, she's gotten so big.
- Olivia!

15:11.844 --> 15:13.877
- Hi.
- Do you know

15:13.879 --> 15:16.879
anybody here who could watch her,
just for an hour or so, until my break?

15:16.881 --> 15:18.383
Just an hour.

15:19.884 --> 15:23.018
Okay, fine, but you know
you only ever talk to me

15:23.020 --> 15:24.689
when you have
animal issues, right?

15:27.259 --> 15:29.693
Am I interrupting something?

15:29.695 --> 15:34.031
Now, this could not possibly be a
dog in the VA against all the regs.

15:34.033 --> 15:36.331
I know, Teo. We can't
leave Bella home today.

15:36.333 --> 15:38.834
If the landlord catches us with a
dog, we could get evicted.

15:38.836 --> 15:40.170
Now, I understand.

15:40.172 --> 15:42.171
The game is Crowd
in a Small Room.

15:42.173 --> 15:43.609
Bella, huh?

15:45.009 --> 15:46.709
You know what?

15:46.711 --> 15:49.244
I've got this.

15:49.246 --> 15:52.080
Everybody? Everybody?

15:52.082 --> 15:54.751
Thought I'd bring a special
guest to today's meeting.

15:54.753 --> 15:56.618
I'd like you to
meet the lovely Bella.

15:56.620 --> 15:58.454
- Hi, Bella.
- Great. That's great.

15:58.456 --> 16:00.323
- Look at that.
- How long you been sober?

16:01.458 --> 16:03.292
That long, huh?

16:03.294 --> 16:05.197
It was a good idea, man.

16:07.097 --> 16:08.797
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

16:08.799 --> 16:10.499
- It'll only happen once in a while.
- Yeah.

16:10.501 --> 16:12.502
<i>After that,
I really liked Go to Work.</i>

16:12.504 --> 16:14.671
- Looks like she likes being here.
- I think she does, too.

16:14.673 --> 16:16.272
I just have no motivation.

16:16.274 --> 16:19.108
Like, I know it would be
good for me, but...

16:19.110 --> 16:21.645
<i>I could always feel
Mom's sadness going away</i>

16:21.647 --> 16:25.815
<i>when I comforted her,
like Mother Cat comforted me.</i>

16:25.817 --> 16:28.785
Mack, what's it
been like with you?

16:28.787 --> 16:30.990
It's, uh... It's like...

16:32.323 --> 16:35.090
It's, like,
pain all the time.

16:35.092 --> 16:36.592
- <i>But she wasn't the only one...</i>
- Every morning.

16:36.594 --> 16:38.294
<i>...who needed me.</i>

16:38.296 --> 16:40.532
<i>Mack was the most sad.</i>

16:44.336 --> 16:46.569
That's real. That's real talk.

16:46.571 --> 16:48.337
You know? Hey, girl.

16:48.339 --> 16:50.809
I'm gonna
bring her again tomorrow.

16:54.145 --> 16:55.611
Look who's here!

16:57.182 --> 17:00.150
<i>Now, I have
lots of new friends.</i>

17:00.152 --> 17:03.219
- Come on, Bella.
- Look at that.

17:03.221 --> 17:06.721
<i>Drew took me on rides
in his small car.</i>

17:06.723 --> 17:08.490
Bella, open.

17:08.492 --> 17:11.529
<i>Steve had
really delicious spoons.</i>

17:14.999 --> 17:18.166
<i>Some of my friends
had tags, just like me.</i>

17:19.371 --> 17:20.439
Aw, good girl.

17:21.873 --> 17:23.305
Bella!

17:23.307 --> 17:24.473
Bella, get down.

17:24.476 --> 17:26.375
We're doing laundry. Down.

17:26.377 --> 17:28.880
<i>I really liked
Doing Laundry.</i>

17:31.717 --> 17:34.284
<i>And everyone played
a game called Dr. Gann.</i>

17:34.286 --> 17:35.551
Doctor! Ha!

17:35.553 --> 17:37.519
- Dr. Gann.
- Hey, let's go.

17:37.521 --> 17:38.821
- Hey, Dr. Gann.
- Good morning. How are you?

17:38.823 --> 17:42.158
Dr. Gann.
In you go. In you go!

17:42.160 --> 17:44.026
Were
you going in, or...

17:44.028 --> 17:46.830
- Appreciate it. Thank you.
- Your turn.

17:46.832 --> 17:48.398
- Oh, shoot.
- Okay, no...

17:48.400 --> 17:50.533
- Take your time. Okay.
- Thank you.

17:50.535 --> 17:52.200
All right. Good morning.

17:52.202 --> 17:53.569
- Good morning, Doc.
- Good morning, everyone.

17:53.571 --> 17:54.770
- Morning, Dr. Gann.
- Good morning, Doc.

17:54.772 --> 17:55.640
- Morning.
- What's up, Doc?

17:57.775 --> 17:58.877
Okay.

18:10.355 --> 18:12.087
Everything all right?

18:17.061 --> 18:18.228
Bye, Doc.

18:22.299 --> 18:24.834
- Good girl.
- What a good girl.

18:24.836 --> 18:26.536
Let's do that again!

18:26.538 --> 18:28.240
- So smart.
- Good girl.

18:30.942 --> 18:32.478
I had fun last night.

18:34.278 --> 18:36.546
Me, too.

18:36.548 --> 18:39.015
<i>Now, whenever Lucas and I
went looking for that squirrel,</i>

18:39.017 --> 18:40.616
- <i>Olivia came, too.</i>
- Next time, all right?

18:40.618 --> 18:42.086
So, there's gonna be
a next time? Got it.

18:47.692 --> 18:49.560
All right, let's go.

18:50.595 --> 18:52.594
- Take Bella?
- Yeah.

18:52.596 --> 18:53.930
- I'm gonna call the rescue.
- Yeah.

18:53.932 --> 18:54.967
Hey!

18:55.933 --> 18:58.433
Wait! Stop!

18:58.435 --> 19:00.068
What the hell you doing?

19:00.070 --> 19:02.270
There are still cats living there.
You can't do this.

19:02.272 --> 19:04.009
- We've got a permit.
- That doesn't matter.

19:08.646 --> 19:12.014
- You kidding me?
- Hey!

19:12.016 --> 19:14.350
- I have had enough of you, you crazy...
- They're on it.

19:14.352 --> 19:17.085
Can I talk to you for a minute?

19:17.087 --> 19:18.621
Why you screwing
with my life?

19:18.623 --> 19:20.155
How did you
even get a permit?

19:21.492 --> 19:24.160
Property's certified.
No cats.

19:24.162 --> 19:26.629
- Hey.
- I'm live-streaming, cat killer.

19:26.631 --> 19:28.064
There are no cats!

19:32.403 --> 19:33.736
Mother Cat!

19:35.306 --> 19:36.471
Where are you going?

19:36.473 --> 19:38.841
No cats?

19:38.843 --> 19:40.942
The rescue organization that I work
with just called the Building Commission

19:40.944 --> 19:42.010
to have your permit yanked.

19:42.012 --> 19:43.411
Like they move that fast.

19:43.413 --> 19:45.347
They do when
our board member calls.

19:45.349 --> 19:46.650
She's a county commissioner.

19:46.652 --> 19:47.950
Hey, Gunter.

19:47.952 --> 19:49.952
Yeah.

19:49.954 --> 19:51.155
It's about your permit.

19:55.926 --> 19:58.126
Who on earth
could that be?

19:58.128 --> 19:59.932
I don't know.
I'll get it.

20:04.469 --> 20:06.702
Excuse me.

20:06.704 --> 20:08.671
There's been a complaint that you
may be harboring a dangerous animal.

20:08.673 --> 20:10.706
A complaint? From who?

20:10.708 --> 20:14.142
As you may know, pit bulls are
illegal in the City of Denver.

20:14.144 --> 20:17.313
As long as it's on your
property, we can't touch it.

20:17.315 --> 20:20.048
- I remember him.
- I am informing you

20:20.050 --> 20:23.818
that if that dog gets
picked up on the street,

20:23.820 --> 20:25.122
it will be impounded.

20:26.691 --> 20:28.192
Have a nice night.

20:33.798 --> 20:36.231
Okay, Bella,
this is very important.

20:36.233 --> 20:38.167
We're gonna try this again.

20:38.169 --> 20:40.339
Okay. You ready?

20:40.971 --> 20:42.007
And...

20:43.875 --> 20:45.042
Go home.

20:47.045 --> 20:48.080
That's it, Bella.

20:49.013 --> 20:50.115
Go home.

20:51.082 --> 20:52.217
Yep.

20:58.323 --> 21:02.257
Best game ever!

21:02.259 --> 21:06.863
<i>Doing Go Home meant I should
put my head right here.</i>

21:06.865 --> 21:08.631
Yes! You did it!

21:08.633 --> 21:11.699
You did Go Home.
Well done.

21:11.701 --> 21:14.970
- That was impressive.
- Good job, Bella.

21:14.972 --> 21:17.105
- Good girl.
- Wow.

21:17.107 --> 21:19.574
So, now,
if we take Bella off the property

21:19.576 --> 21:24.146
and Animal Control tries to take
her, we just say, "Go home."

21:24.148 --> 21:26.784
<i>I loved making Lucas happy.</i>

21:33.625 --> 21:35.591
That squirrel!

21:35.593 --> 21:37.129
<i>I had to have that squirrel.</i>

21:40.565 --> 21:42.134
Squirrel, squirrel, squirrel!

21:46.904 --> 21:48.072
Bella?

21:49.273 --> 21:50.274
Bella!

21:51.308 --> 21:52.510
Bella!

22:04.756 --> 22:07.059
Bella!

22:13.865 --> 22:16.500
Bella, I've been looking
all over for you.

22:17.269 --> 22:19.468
Bad dog.

22:19.470 --> 22:23.471
Bella, you can never,
ever do that again.

22:23.473 --> 22:25.910
I don't care about the window,
but you cannot run away.

22:28.779 --> 22:31.479
Hold it right there, pal.

22:31.481 --> 22:33.449
I'm impounding
that animal.

22:33.451 --> 22:36.352
- No, you are not.
- Yes, I am, and that's my backup.

22:36.354 --> 22:39.322
This is a pit bull.
And this is a legal impoundment.

22:39.324 --> 22:41.460
If he resists,
you arrest him.

22:42.660 --> 22:44.293
Go home, Bella.

22:44.295 --> 22:45.929
Bella, go home.

22:45.931 --> 22:48.400
- Go home, Bella.
- <i>But you need me.</i>

22:49.366 --> 22:50.932
Bella.

22:50.934 --> 22:53.268
Bella, please, go home.

22:53.270 --> 22:54.970
Bella, please.
Go home, Bella.

22:54.972 --> 22:56.305
That's right.

22:56.307 --> 22:58.207
- Easy does it.
- Bella, go home.

22:58.209 --> 22:59.676
Easy. There we go.

22:59.678 --> 23:01.477
Don't do that.

23:01.479 --> 23:03.613
- Sir.
- Come on.

23:03.615 --> 23:06.315
Sir, let go, now.

23:06.317 --> 23:07.719
You need to let him
have the dog.

23:09.420 --> 23:11.189
Not with that on her.

23:15.693 --> 23:17.826
Let go.

23:17.828 --> 23:20.298
Chuck, let him do it.

23:25.603 --> 23:26.736
It's okay, Bella.

23:26.738 --> 23:28.871
It's okay. It's okay.
I got you.

23:28.873 --> 23:31.607
Follow me.

23:31.609 --> 23:34.445
It's okay. I got you,
baby. It's okay.

23:36.713 --> 23:39.248
It's okay.

23:39.250 --> 23:41.651
Bella, I screwed up.

23:41.653 --> 23:43.020
I'm so sorry.

23:48.894 --> 23:50.992
- All right.
- <i>All of a sudden,</i>

23:50.994 --> 23:52.594
- <i>I smelled so many other dogs.</i>
- You're okay. It's all right.

24:02.941 --> 24:05.607
I will come get you,
Bella. Understand?

24:05.609 --> 24:08.744
I'm sorry I didn't do
Go Home, Lucas.

24:08.746 --> 24:11.145
- I will not let them hurt you.
- Okay, that's enough.

24:11.147 --> 24:12.650
Step away, please.

24:14.051 --> 24:15.485
Step away.

24:15.487 --> 24:17.788
Please.

24:31.935 --> 24:33.637
Lucas?

24:48.752 --> 24:51.956
<i>It was so loud,
and all the dogs were so sad.</i>

24:54.759 --> 24:55.826
Okay.

24:57.327 --> 24:59.661
In you go.

24:59.663 --> 25:02.500
<i>I thought if I did Good Dog,
they'd let me go back to Lucas.</i>

25:06.837 --> 25:08.138
<i>I did Sit.</i>

25:09.941 --> 25:11.675
<i>I did Sit some more.</i>

25:13.144 --> 25:14.546
<i>I did No Barks.</i>

25:16.615 --> 25:18.517
<i>I did Lots of Barks.</i>

25:21.484 --> 25:24.255
<i>I really needed
my Lucas blanket.</i>

25:26.324 --> 25:28.593
<i>I should have done Go Home.</i>

25:37.669 --> 25:38.703
Come on.

25:39.837 --> 25:41.770
Hello.

25:41.772 --> 25:43.605
Hang on.

25:43.607 --> 25:45.341
Aw, you don't seem like

25:45.343 --> 25:48.043
such a dangerous animal to
me, sweet girl, hmm?

25:48.045 --> 25:50.081
Come on. Come on.

25:53.884 --> 25:55.951
- Hey!
- Lucas!

25:55.953 --> 25:58.321
- Hi. Hi.
- I'm ready to do Go Home.

25:58.323 --> 25:59.822
Hey. See, I'm here.

25:59.824 --> 26:01.390
- I'm here.
- Well, there's question one.

26:01.392 --> 26:02.958
She's obviously your dog.

26:02.960 --> 26:05.661
Good girl. I know.
I know. Good girl.

26:05.663 --> 26:08.029
All right. There you go.

26:08.031 --> 26:09.865
So, you've paid the fine.

26:09.867 --> 26:12.567
I just need to give you
the discharge information.

26:12.569 --> 26:16.037
In Denver, all that's required for
a dog to be classified as a pit bull

26:16.039 --> 26:20.375
is for three Animal Control
officers to certify that it is.

26:20.377 --> 26:22.745
And Bella has been
certified pit bull.

26:22.747 --> 26:24.747
What does
"certified pit" mean?

26:24.749 --> 26:26.817
It means if they pick her up
again, she'll be euthanized.

26:28.787 --> 26:31.353
- What?
- That's the law.

26:31.355 --> 26:34.556
Pit bull's a pretty loose description.
It's like saying "hound dog."

26:34.558 --> 26:38.059
So, the City Council essentially voted
that a dog can be banned from the city

26:38.061 --> 26:39.362
because of how it looks.

26:39.364 --> 26:41.197
That's basically
racism for dogs.

26:41.199 --> 26:43.032
I know. It's stupid.

26:43.034 --> 26:45.601
I mean, Bella is the most
gentle dog in the world.

26:45.603 --> 26:47.736
You should see her at the
hospital with the veterans.

26:47.738 --> 26:49.371
I mean, they love her.

26:49.373 --> 26:51.105
What about if we move?

26:51.107 --> 26:53.574
Like, Golden or somewhere
out of the city limits?

26:53.576 --> 26:55.510
That works.

26:55.512 --> 26:56.845
Meanwhile, do you have someone
who can look after her?

26:56.847 --> 26:58.381
My aunt and uncle,
they live in Farmington.

26:58.383 --> 27:00.548
- Maybe they could help us.
- New Mexico?

27:00.550 --> 27:02.119
It's like 400 miles.

27:03.953 --> 27:08.259
I'm really ready to do
Go Home now.

27:11.128 --> 27:14.997
All right, here we go.
Got your dinosaur.

27:14.999 --> 27:16.201
What else do we have?

27:22.173 --> 27:23.971
It's so good
of you to do this.

27:23.973 --> 27:25.674
We're just happy to help.

27:25.676 --> 27:27.144
Olivia's such a sweetheart.

27:27.978 --> 27:29.612
Well, this is it.

27:29.614 --> 27:31.016
I'll be in the car.

27:33.417 --> 27:36.151
Why is everyone so sad?

27:36.153 --> 27:38.056
We're all home, now.

27:39.324 --> 27:41.493
Bella, I'm so sorry.

27:44.162 --> 27:46.228
See you soon.

27:46.230 --> 27:49.065
Okay, I'll sneak out
the back window.

27:49.067 --> 27:52.537
At least there's
no screen on that one.

27:55.740 --> 27:56.875
Hey.

27:58.742 --> 28:01.178
Here, I got ya, I got ya.

28:02.814 --> 28:04.345
Hello.

28:04.347 --> 28:06.614
Stop.

28:06.616 --> 28:11.452
Backup can't possibly get here
fast enough to help you.

28:11.454 --> 28:15.524
We understand the little game
that you're playing here.

28:15.526 --> 28:17.159
It's Gunter, isn't it?

28:17.161 --> 28:19.161
You work for him?

28:19.163 --> 28:21.462
Maybe you're just buddies.

28:21.464 --> 28:23.231
Now, you're gonna
let my son

28:23.233 --> 28:26.401
walk to that car
to say goodbye to his dog

28:26.403 --> 28:28.707
without any
interference from you.

28:29.740 --> 28:30.775
Copy?

28:32.143 --> 28:33.178
Copy.

28:38.516 --> 28:41.352
Go on, Bella.
That's it.

28:43.019 --> 28:44.288
Hey.

28:48.326 --> 28:50.959
You're such
a good girl, Bella.

28:50.961 --> 28:55.663
I know you won't understand,
but I'm not abandoning you.

28:55.665 --> 28:57.701
I just have to send you
somewhere safe.

28:58.568 --> 29:00.736
Where are we going?

29:00.738 --> 29:03.672
Why can't I ride
in the front with you?

29:03.674 --> 29:05.507
Here.

29:05.509 --> 29:07.042
You gotta have your blanket.

29:07.044 --> 29:09.545
Why did he bring
my Lucas blanket?

29:09.547 --> 29:11.080
It should be on the bed.

29:11.082 --> 29:15.651
I promise, very soon,
you'll get to go home.

29:26.063 --> 29:29.834
Lucas said, "Go home,"
but then he shut the door.

29:39.576 --> 29:41.242
<i>I need Lucas!</i>

29:41.244 --> 29:44.478
Please! No!

30:06.537 --> 30:08.937
<i>His scent was fading.</i>

30:08.939 --> 30:12.410
<i>I was getting farther
and farther away.</i>

30:22.420 --> 30:24.819
<i>I smelled my Lucas blanket
to feel better,</i>

30:24.821 --> 30:27.625
<i>but it wasn't Lucas.</i>

30:53.416 --> 30:54.482
Sit.

30:57.354 --> 30:58.990
Bella,
come here.

31:00.324 --> 31:02.423
Yes.

31:02.425 --> 31:04.528
Oh, you're so pretty.
Yes, you are.

31:09.199 --> 31:11.033
<i>These people were nice.</i>

31:11.035 --> 31:15.202
<i>They took care of me,
but they weren't my family.</i>

31:15.204 --> 31:16.638
<i>This wasn't home.</i>

31:19.977 --> 31:21.709
Hello?

31:21.711 --> 31:24.246
Hey, how is everything?

31:24.248 --> 31:27.415
Oh, she's fine. Yeah. Really?

31:27.417 --> 31:30.587
Okay. All right.
See you tomorrow, then.

31:33.490 --> 31:35.856
Guess what?

31:35.858 --> 31:38.227
They found
a nice place in Golden,

31:38.229 --> 31:41.529
and they're coming
to get you tomorrow.

31:41.531 --> 31:44.667
I bet you're ready to go home.
You're a good dog, Bella.

31:44.669 --> 31:46.401
<i>Jose said, "Go home."</i>

31:46.403 --> 31:47.568
- You're a good dog.
- <i>But how?</i>

31:47.570 --> 31:48.705
Good night.

31:50.107 --> 31:52.042
<i>That feeling
came again.</i>

31:53.676 --> 31:55.913
<i>I was supposed
to be with Lucas.</i>

31:59.316 --> 32:02.854
<i>I had to find a way
to get to him.</i>

32:13.564 --> 32:15.229
<i>I didn't know
what that loud thing was,</i>

32:15.231 --> 32:18.603
<i>but Jose sure liked to take it
for walks around the yard.</i>

32:24.508 --> 32:27.511
<i>But I do remember that
from Snow Do Your Business.</i>

32:35.952 --> 32:37.288
Wait.

32:48.298 --> 32:49.299
Yes!

32:57.642 --> 32:59.106
I'm doing it!

32:59.108 --> 33:01.778
I'm doing Go Home!

33:43.053 --> 33:47.191
<i>I could tell that Go Home
was very far away.</i>

33:55.199 --> 33:58.269
<i>But I knew that I was going
in the right direction.</i>

34:05.843 --> 34:09.844
<i>The feeling now was a pull,
like I was on a leash</i>

34:09.847 --> 34:13.514
<i>and being told
how to do Go Home.</i>

34:13.516 --> 34:18.321
<i>And if I kept going,
I knew I would see Lucas again.</i>

34:35.405 --> 34:39.842
<i>By that first night,
I was so tired.</i>

34:39.844 --> 34:42.543
<i>And there were so many
strange smells.</i>

34:50.186 --> 34:51.154
What's that?

34:54.625 --> 34:57.561
It looks like a cat,
but it smells like a dog.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.902
I hope it doesn't come back.

35:13.777 --> 35:15.510
<i>It was breakfast time,</i>

35:15.512 --> 35:18.048
<i>but I couldn't find
a bowl of food anywhere.</i>

35:20.717 --> 35:22.751
It's not in a bowl,

35:22.753 --> 35:23.921
but I'll take it.

35:26.590 --> 35:28.826
This breakfast is really fast!

35:35.766 --> 35:37.802
I need breakfast!

35:42.639 --> 35:45.443
This breakfast was harder
to hunt than that squirrel.

35:53.983 --> 35:57.788
<i>I was hungrier
than I'd ever been.</i>

35:59.856 --> 36:01.488
People.

36:01.490 --> 36:03.561
There are people down there.

36:23.112 --> 36:24.381
A pack.

36:26.751 --> 36:29.784
Maybe I shouldn't
bother them.

36:29.786 --> 36:31.154
But I'm so hungry.

36:35.525 --> 36:38.726
One Tooth is big.

36:38.728 --> 36:42.265
To be polite, I'll carefully sniff
where the other dogs have marked.

36:50.206 --> 36:51.340
What?

36:51.342 --> 36:53.878
Oh, Crazy Hair is in charge.

36:54.911 --> 36:56.012
Thanks.

36:57.813 --> 36:59.648
<i>This was a great pack.</i>

36:59.650 --> 37:01.749
<i>They knew just where to go
to get the best chicken.</i>

37:01.751 --> 37:03.954
Hey. There you are.

37:05.556 --> 37:07.990
Yeah, today's
special. Chicken.

37:07.992 --> 37:09.291
You like that. You like...

37:09.293 --> 37:10.693
I love
this chicken guy.

37:10.695 --> 37:13.461
Okay, very good.
That's it. That's it.

37:13.463 --> 37:15.432
You can go now, okay? Go.

37:19.969 --> 37:22.170
Coming.

37:22.172 --> 37:24.972
<i>One Tooth was a brave hunter,</i>

37:24.974 --> 37:28.010
<i>who wasn't afraid of anything.</i>

37:28.012 --> 37:30.280
<i>It was exciting
to learn to hunt from him.</i>

37:33.884 --> 37:35.717
- <i>This pack was so much fun.</i>
- Hello.

37:35.719 --> 37:37.786
Hi, sweethearts.

37:37.788 --> 37:39.954
Oh, and who are you?
Are you new?

37:39.956 --> 37:42.257
There you go,
sweethearts. Yeah.

37:42.259 --> 37:45.526
Please go home now.
Go on home now. Go on home.

37:45.528 --> 37:47.461
How did she know
I was doing Go Home?

37:47.463 --> 37:48.465
Go home!

37:53.903 --> 37:56.371
- <i>It was a wonderful day.</i>
- Good boy, Sarge.

37:56.373 --> 37:58.206
But where's One Tooth going?

37:58.208 --> 37:59.309
All right, in you go. Come on.

38:07.617 --> 38:09.120
And Shaggy Butt, too?

38:11.221 --> 38:14.659
Guess that just leaves
you and me, Crazy Hair.

38:16.193 --> 38:18.059
Oh, wait.

38:18.061 --> 38:20.163
Everyone in this pack
has their own people.

38:24.534 --> 38:28.536
<i>Crazy Hair wanted me to go with
him, to be part of his family.</i>

38:28.538 --> 38:31.775
<i>It seemed nice in there,
with lots of good smells.</i>

38:33.943 --> 38:36.246
<i>I could be happy here.</i>

38:37.481 --> 38:38.916
<i>But they didn't need me.</i>

38:41.751 --> 38:44.318
<i>Mom needed me.</i>

38:44.320 --> 38:46.755
<i>Lucas needed me.</i>

38:46.757 --> 38:49.523
<i>And I needed them.</i>

38:52.929 --> 38:55.496
Lucy! There you are.

38:55.498 --> 38:59.135
<i>So, I had to keep
doing Go Home.</i>

39:19.989 --> 39:23.525
<i>Now, I knew that to hunt I needed
to go where there were people</i>

39:23.527 --> 39:27.197
<i>and do what
One Tooth taught me.</i>

39:57.527 --> 39:59.396
<i>I smelled blood.</i>

40:02.065 --> 40:05.432
<i>It was the largest animal
I had ever seen.</i>

40:05.434 --> 40:08.269
<i>And something very bad
had happened to her.</i>

40:08.271 --> 40:10.373
Come on!
Whoo! Through here.

40:11.442 --> 40:13.141
I see it. Go.

40:13.143 --> 40:14.708
Thing's gotta be
worth a thousand bucks.

40:14.710 --> 40:16.543
Oh, at least. Beautiful.

40:16.545 --> 40:18.079
What do you figure?
About 125 pounds?

40:18.081 --> 40:19.847
Oh, yeah.

40:19.849 --> 40:20.884
- Hey, let's get a selfie.
- Yeah, you bet.

40:29.059 --> 40:30.358
Okay, ready?

40:30.360 --> 40:32.528
- Yeah.
- Here.

40:32.530 --> 40:35.563
Wow. She's beautiful.

40:35.565 --> 40:37.432
Yeah,
that one's going up on the wall.

40:37.434 --> 40:38.532
Yeah.

40:38.534 --> 40:40.334
What is that?

40:40.336 --> 40:43.271
<i>It kind of looks
like a cat.</i>

40:43.273 --> 40:46.911
<i>I hoped the cat would leave with me
and not get caught by those bad men.</i>

40:49.445 --> 40:53.115
<i>That cat didn't smell
like any cat I ever knew.</i>

40:53.117 --> 40:55.286
<i>Was it following me?</i>

40:57.954 --> 41:00.123
<i>Yep, it was following me.</i>

41:04.827 --> 41:09.097
<i>And suddenly, I realized
it wasn't a full-grown cat.</i>

41:09.099 --> 41:11.465
<i>It was still just a kitten.</i>

41:11.467 --> 41:13.901
<i>A really big kitten.</i>

41:13.903 --> 41:16.907
Come on,
Big Kitten. This way.

41:28.952 --> 41:32.189
<i>That big animal must have
been this kitten's mother.</i>

41:34.724 --> 41:36.758
<i>Big Kitten made me
think of Mother Dog</i>

41:36.760 --> 41:39.797
<i>and how sad I was
when she was taken away.</i>

41:42.632 --> 41:45.603
<i>She needed someone
to take care of her.</i>

42:09.460 --> 42:12.396
<i>Big Kitten's mother
couldn't feed her anymore,</i>

42:13.130 --> 42:15.332
<i>so, I did.</i>

42:27.143 --> 42:30.514
<i>I was Big Kitten's
Mother Cat now.</i>

42:41.523 --> 42:44.358
<i>Big Kitten needed to eat,
and so did I.</i>

42:44.360 --> 42:46.793
<i>So, I did what
any mother would do.</i>

42:46.795 --> 42:47.998
<i>I went hunting.</i>

42:54.103 --> 42:56.338
Sorry, baby!

43:13.123 --> 43:15.356
Hey! Hey! Drop it!

43:15.358 --> 43:17.258
Oh!

43:42.418 --> 43:46.155
<i>Many nights, Big Kitten
would wander off on her own.</i>

43:54.331 --> 43:57.766
<i>I would sleep
and dream of home.</i>

43:57.768 --> 44:00.838
You ready for your
tiny piece of cheese?

44:03.005 --> 44:06.175
Here you go. Good girl.

44:07.643 --> 44:09.612
<i>You're such a good dog, Bella.</i>

44:18.688 --> 44:22.023
<i>As time passed
and Big Kitten got bigger,</i>

44:22.025 --> 44:28.295
<i>she still didn't seem to
understand how to do Go Home.</i>

44:28.297 --> 44:30.097
<i>So, when she tried
to take me away from it,</i>

44:30.099 --> 44:32.168
<i>I would always
have to bring her back.</i>

44:36.639 --> 44:40.710
<i>Whenever Big Kitten went out at
night, someone gave her food.</i>

44:44.347 --> 44:46.280
<i>Cats love fish,</i>

44:46.282 --> 44:48.218
<i>but I wish someone
would give her chicken.</i>

44:57.360 --> 44:59.730
<i>We kept each other warm.</i>

45:02.498 --> 45:04.500
<i>We were family now.</i>

45:16.211 --> 45:18.545
<i>I had been smelling
something all morning.</i>

45:19.750 --> 45:23.086
<i>Something like dog.</i>

45:27.291 --> 45:29.123
<i>First, I heard them.</i>

45:32.862 --> 45:35.031
<i>Then I saw them.</i>

45:38.969 --> 45:41.068
<i>Their eyes were cold.</i>

45:45.876 --> 45:47.175
<i>They were hunting us.</i>

45:53.016 --> 45:55.586
<i>And I had
to protect Big Kitten.</i>

46:37.427 --> 46:40.226
Hey! Get out!
Get out of here!

46:40.228 --> 46:41.362
Scram! Get out!

46:47.369 --> 46:49.135
Hey, check it out.

46:49.137 --> 46:52.206
- Is that a bobcat?
- No, no, it's a cougar.

46:52.208 --> 46:53.343
It's a young cougar.

46:55.644 --> 46:56.878
<i>Big Kitten
was afraid of the men.</i>

46:56.880 --> 46:58.780
Whoa.
That's really fast.

46:58.782 --> 47:01.014
<i>But I decided to see
if they would give us food.</i>

47:02.652 --> 47:04.684
Pretty scared to me.

47:04.686 --> 47:06.454
I've never seen a cougar
in the wild before.

47:06.456 --> 47:09.423
I mean, this thing was huge.
It was like 10 feet long.

47:09.425 --> 47:11.025
- Easy, 12.
- Yeah.

47:11.027 --> 47:14.798
Hey. Let's see if your name
is on your tag, huh?

47:15.764 --> 47:16.732
Who's a good girl?

47:19.135 --> 47:21.769
- She's a cutie.
- She is.

47:21.771 --> 47:23.637
Want some ham?

47:23.639 --> 47:25.472
There's your ham. There you go.
Sit. Oh, good girl.

47:25.474 --> 47:27.041
Her name is Bella.

47:27.043 --> 47:28.775
Give me a paw. Good girl.
There you go.

47:28.777 --> 47:30.845
And there's a telephone number.
"Lucas Ray."

47:30.847 --> 47:32.347
Lucas?

47:32.349 --> 47:34.518
I'm gonna call the guy.

47:36.853 --> 47:38.686
Hey, guys, I think there's
something moving out there.

47:38.688 --> 47:40.454
Okay, it's going
to voice mail.

47:40.456 --> 47:42.490
<i>Hi.
You've reached Lucas Ray...</i>

47:42.492 --> 47:44.291
- That's him!
- <i>Assistant case manager</i>

47:44.293 --> 47:46.494
<i>at McLaren VA Hospital.
Please leave a message.</i>

47:46.496 --> 47:48.762
<i>If you're calling
about my lost dog Bella...</i>

47:48.764 --> 47:51.132
Man, she's kind
of freaking out.

47:51.134 --> 47:54.802
<i>Please, leave your number
or call Olivia at 612-589-1743...</i>

47:54.804 --> 47:55.806
What?

47:59.442 --> 48:01.342
- Cougar! Get in the truck!
- Oh, God.

48:01.344 --> 48:02.909
I'm here, Lucas.

48:02.911 --> 48:04.347
I'm here. I'm here.

48:40.416 --> 48:42.452
It's Snow Do Your Business!

50:11.373 --> 50:13.676
She acted
like that was easy.

51:04.827 --> 51:06.196
A dog!

51:12.702 --> 51:14.905
It's been so long
since I played with a dog.

51:21.710 --> 51:23.744
Dutch, what are
you barking at?

51:23.746 --> 51:24.748
Hey.

51:27.851 --> 51:30.153
- Be quiet. Come on!
- Shut up!

51:35.090 --> 51:36.159
Dutch!

51:36.858 --> 51:37.960
You stupid mutt!

51:39.161 --> 51:40.394
Dutch!

51:44.333 --> 51:45.302
Get out of there!

51:54.777 --> 51:55.811
Dutch!

52:44.728 --> 52:47.496
<i>I could smell
the fear of the other dog.</i>

52:53.168 --> 52:55.804
He must be down here.
These are his dogs.

52:58.608 --> 53:00.544
- Here! Here!
- Come on.

53:03.780 --> 53:05.612
Is he breathing?

53:05.614 --> 53:08.414
Call 911.

53:08.416 --> 53:09.818
Okay, head up.

53:11.487 --> 53:13.220
- Is he gonna make it?
- Yeah.

53:13.222 --> 53:14.454
You saved his life.

53:14.456 --> 53:16.990
What about the dogs?
These are his.

53:16.992 --> 53:19.325
I mean,
I guess that's up to you guys.

53:19.327 --> 53:21.498
We can call Animal Control for
you, but we can't wait for them.

53:23.632 --> 53:25.401
Sorry, guys. Good luck.

53:27.003 --> 53:28.271
I guess
they go with us.

53:29.873 --> 53:31.537
Come on, dogs.

53:31.539 --> 53:32.807
Big Kitten!

53:32.809 --> 53:34.974
Come on.
Come on.

53:34.976 --> 53:37.513
- Don't take me away from her.
- She needs me.

53:40.583 --> 53:43.684
Come on, dogs. Come on.

53:43.686 --> 53:45.088
No.

53:46.521 --> 53:49.326
Come on. Come on.

53:52.961 --> 53:54.597
Please.

54:00.402 --> 54:02.838
Dutch, come here.

54:04.541 --> 54:07.541
Come on, girl.
You can trust us.

54:07.543 --> 54:10.380
Why do I get the feeling
you're secretly enjoying this?

54:11.146 --> 54:13.046
I like dogs.

54:13.048 --> 54:14.682
We need to feed
this girl more, though.

54:14.684 --> 54:17.617
- You can see her ribs.
- Out.

54:17.619 --> 54:19.954
Hey, no, no, no, no.
No. Don't scratch.

54:19.956 --> 54:21.054
What's your name?

54:21.056 --> 54:23.523
Molly? Ellie?

54:23.525 --> 54:24.791
Let me out.

54:24.793 --> 54:27.193
- Blanche.
- Blanche?

54:27.195 --> 54:28.729
You gotta
be kidding me.

54:28.731 --> 54:30.563
My mother's dog
was named Blanche.

54:30.565 --> 54:34.101
Well, that explains a lot.

54:35.438 --> 54:37.204
See?
He likes it here.

54:37.206 --> 54:40.074
Gavin, we have to
give the guy his dogs back.

54:40.076 --> 54:42.309
I like
<i>The Golden Girls.</i>

54:42.311 --> 54:45.981
<i>Ever so faintly,
I could smell Big Kitten on the wind.</i>

54:47.282 --> 54:49.782
<i>She was waiting for me.</i>

54:49.784 --> 54:55.054
<i>And beyond her,
Lucas and Go Home.</i>

54:55.056 --> 54:58.727
Beatrice?
Millie? Sophie?

54:59.728 --> 55:01.461
Sadie?

55:01.463 --> 55:02.666
Chloe?

55:03.867 --> 55:04.834
Bella.

55:07.202 --> 55:09.769
Bella.

55:09.771 --> 55:13.574
Bella! See? See, I told you.
It's Bella. That's a good dog.

55:13.576 --> 55:15.642
- How did he know my name?
- Your name is Bella.

55:15.644 --> 55:18.012
When we get back to the city,
yeah, I'm gonna get you

55:18.014 --> 55:19.445
a tag with your name on it.

55:19.447 --> 55:21.648
I am. Yes, I am.

55:21.650 --> 55:23.987
Gavin.

55:37.465 --> 55:40.036
<i>Dutch liked it here,
and so did I.</i>

55:42.672 --> 55:44.474
<i>We had food
whenever we needed it.</i>

55:46.208 --> 55:47.210
Want a snack?

55:48.744 --> 55:50.947
<i>We were
inside and warm.</i>

55:55.583 --> 55:58.818
<i>Dutch and I had a
soft spot to sleep on.</i>

55:58.820 --> 56:00.356
<i>And each other.</i>

56:03.291 --> 56:06.362
<i>It started to feel like home.</i>

56:17.673 --> 56:20.076
- Hey.
- Hey.

56:22.244 --> 56:23.811
What's this?

56:23.813 --> 56:26.115
To celebrate you
finishing your novel.

56:30.585 --> 56:32.087
Hey. Come here.

56:34.523 --> 56:38.092
Did you put our phone number
on their dog tags?

56:38.094 --> 56:40.797
Well, whose number would I put on it?

56:48.704 --> 56:51.738
<i>This smell was familiar.</i>

56:51.740 --> 56:52.840
You helping me?

56:52.842 --> 56:54.974
You like doing laundry, Bella?

56:54.976 --> 56:56.844
- Hello.
- <i>Doing Laundry? I knew that game.</i>

56:56.846 --> 56:58.311
Guess you do, huh?

56:58.313 --> 56:59.516
Yeah.

57:03.485 --> 57:04.918
What is it?

57:04.920 --> 57:07.854
Uh, can you
excuse me, please?

57:07.856 --> 57:10.391
That guy from the avalanche...
His sister.

57:10.393 --> 57:12.128
He's out of the hospital.

57:14.929 --> 57:16.598
I'm sorry, I...

57:17.733 --> 57:19.702
Yes, I'm sure he is.

57:38.119 --> 57:40.887
<i>Dutch had definitely
been here before.</i>

57:40.889 --> 57:43.292
<i>He had marked just about
everything in the yard.</i>

57:44.559 --> 57:45.628
Easy, Dutch. Easy.

57:48.898 --> 57:51.965
Hello? Mr. Kurch?

57:51.967 --> 57:54.401
- Come on, Bella.
- Mr. Kurch? Hello?

57:54.403 --> 57:55.405
Back here.

57:59.208 --> 58:01.778
Aw! Geez! Oh, Dutch.

58:02.311 --> 58:03.744
Get down!

58:03.746 --> 58:05.579
Well, Dutch is just
happy to see you.

58:05.581 --> 58:08.648
I got 11 freaking fractures,
and the dog's jumping all over me.

58:08.650 --> 58:10.983
Get off of me,
stupid dog!

58:10.985 --> 58:12.920
<i>Dutch was
happy to see this man,</i>

58:12.922 --> 58:15.456
<i>but what kind of a man
wouldn't be happy to see Dutch?</i>

58:15.458 --> 58:17.657
I'm Taylor. This is Gavin.

58:17.659 --> 58:18.892
We're the ones
who dug you out.

58:18.894 --> 58:20.793
I don't remember
any of that.

58:20.795 --> 58:24.498
All I know is my sister says
you're bringing the dog over,

58:24.500 --> 58:25.869
which is ridiculous.

58:26.601 --> 58:28.302
Ridiculous?

58:28.304 --> 58:30.103
I don't understand you.

58:30.105 --> 58:33.273
Do I look like I can
take care of a dog?

58:33.275 --> 58:34.809
But they're your dogs.

58:34.811 --> 58:37.514
Dogs? I never even seen
that other one before.

58:39.681 --> 58:41.347
Bella's not yours?

58:41.349 --> 58:43.150
But she was trying
to dig you out.

58:43.152 --> 58:44.420
I'm not taking either one.

58:46.521 --> 58:49.021
But you have to
take Dutch at least.

58:49.023 --> 58:50.858
Whatever you're doing
with that other one,

58:50.860 --> 58:52.228
do the same thing with Dutch.

58:57.298 --> 58:58.300
Come on, dogs.

59:00.168 --> 59:02.302
Let's go, Dutch.
Come on.

59:02.304 --> 59:03.306
Come on.

59:05.141 --> 59:08.244
- Come on.
- That man belongs alone.

59:15.318 --> 59:16.684
Come here.

59:16.686 --> 59:18.117
Come here, Bella.

59:18.119 --> 59:19.220
- Good girl.
- Hey.

59:21.489 --> 59:24.490
So, now, we have two big,
slobbery dogs.

59:24.492 --> 59:26.726
Just like I've always wanted.

59:26.728 --> 59:29.597
Oh, they're good dogs.

59:29.599 --> 59:31.699
- Yeah, they are.
- Hey, come here.

59:31.701 --> 59:33.766
- Come here, Bella. Come here.
- There you are.

59:33.768 --> 59:35.370
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

59:38.173 --> 59:41.541
<i>The snow was gone,
but I knew where I was.</i>

59:41.543 --> 59:44.280
<i>I was near the last place
I saw Big Kitten.</i>

59:45.280 --> 59:47.780
<i>And suddenly, I felt it.</i>

59:47.782 --> 59:53.920
<i>The pull of that invisible
leash, stronger than ever.</i>

59:53.922 --> 59:56.090
You know what we should do?
Go to the pet store.

59:56.092 --> 59:57.260
We need to get dog food.

59:59.362 --> 01:00:01.862
<i>Dutch
wanted me to stay.</i>

01:00:01.864 --> 01:00:04.865
- <i>To be part of this new family.</i>
- Hey, hey! Hey, dogs! No, no, no.

01:00:04.867 --> 01:00:06.934
No, that's too far.

01:00:06.936 --> 01:00:09.034
- Come on!
- Come here.

01:00:09.036 --> 01:00:10.037
- <i>It would have been so easy.</i>
- Dogs! Hey, Dutch.

01:00:10.039 --> 01:00:12.539
- Dutch.
- Come on.

01:00:12.541 --> 01:00:15.409
- Hey, dogs.
- Come. Bella.

01:00:15.411 --> 01:00:16.445
Dutch.

01:00:17.612 --> 01:00:19.045
Dutch.

01:00:19.047 --> 01:00:20.780
- Bella, come on.
- There we go.

01:00:20.782 --> 01:00:23.284
<i>Dutch had
finally gone home,</i>

01:00:23.286 --> 01:00:24.617
- <i>to a home he deserved.</i>
- All right. Good boy, Dutch.

01:00:24.619 --> 01:00:27.287
- Hey, come on, Bella.
- Come here.

01:00:27.289 --> 01:00:28.789
- Bella, come on.
- There you go. Stay. Stay.

01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:30.758
Bella!

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.925
- Wait, Bella. Bella!
- Come here. Come here.

01:00:32.927 --> 01:00:34.130
Bella.

01:00:35.264 --> 01:00:36.496
Bella, come!

01:00:36.498 --> 01:00:38.498
Bella!

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:41.434
<i>Dutch had found
his Lucas.</i>

01:00:41.436 --> 01:00:43.170
- Come on. Come on, Bella.
- Bella.

01:00:43.172 --> 01:00:46.507
<i>Now,
I needed to find mine.</i>

01:00:46.509 --> 01:00:47.610
Bella!

01:01:28.351 --> 01:01:30.282
<i>I was hungry again.</i>

01:01:30.284 --> 01:01:32.318
<i>And I missed Big Kitten.</i>

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:33.822
<i>And Dutch.</i>

01:01:35.556 --> 01:01:39.191
<i>I had to find people places,
so I could eat,</i>

01:01:39.193 --> 01:01:42.097
<i>even though they were
out of my way to do Go Home.</i>

01:01:49.871 --> 01:01:51.804
<i>I looked all over town,</i>

01:01:51.806 --> 01:01:54.109
<i>but all the good hunting
places were closed.</i>

01:01:55.543 --> 01:01:57.846
Wait, is that...

01:01:59.514 --> 01:02:00.583
Chicken!

01:02:08.891 --> 01:02:10.193
<i>And there it was.</i>

01:02:11.327 --> 01:02:13.162
<i>Like they knew I was coming.</i>

01:02:17.231 --> 01:02:19.201
Hey! Hey!

01:02:20.135 --> 01:02:21.170
Stop the dog!

01:02:26.208 --> 01:02:27.740
Hey! Stop that dog!

01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:37.351
Get him! I got him! Hey!

01:02:43.025 --> 01:02:46.295
Food on the floor
is always for the dog!

01:02:49.297 --> 01:02:50.799
Chicken, chicken, chicken!

01:02:55.637 --> 01:02:57.972
<i>It was delicious.</i>

01:02:57.974 --> 01:03:00.474
<i>Big Kitten
would have loved it.</i>

01:03:00.476 --> 01:03:03.911
Hey, maybe you could
use some of this, huh?

01:03:03.913 --> 01:03:05.148
Little water there?

01:03:06.782 --> 01:03:07.784
Attagirl.

01:03:09.217 --> 01:03:11.619
Attagirl.

01:03:11.621 --> 01:03:13.519
Good, baby.

01:03:13.521 --> 01:03:15.521
It's all right. Hey.

01:03:15.523 --> 01:03:18.425
Yeah, you're beautiful.
Yeah.

01:03:18.427 --> 01:03:20.193
Hey, what's this here?

01:03:20.195 --> 01:03:23.463
Yeah, let's see.
Yeah, dog tag.

01:03:23.465 --> 01:03:25.566
It's Bella.

01:03:25.568 --> 01:03:27.967
Yeah, they gave me
a dog tag, too.

01:03:27.969 --> 01:03:29.735
He knew my name.

01:03:29.737 --> 01:03:31.537
- Have I seen him before?
- Even without the tags,

01:03:31.539 --> 01:03:36.342
they got my biometric
data on file.

01:03:36.344 --> 01:03:37.577
Come on.

01:03:37.579 --> 01:03:38.979
Attagirl.

01:03:38.981 --> 01:03:41.617
- No.
- Attagirl.

01:03:45.786 --> 01:03:47.354
<i>His name was Axel,</i>

01:03:47.356 --> 01:03:49.292
<i>and he always
had me on a leash.</i>

01:03:53.362 --> 01:03:55.427
- Aw! Hi, sweet girl.
- Hi.

01:03:55.429 --> 01:03:58.465
You are so sweet.

01:03:58.467 --> 01:04:00.266
- Here you go.
- Bye.

01:04:00.268 --> 01:04:01.236
Thank you.

01:04:07.108 --> 01:04:08.407
Whoo-wee.

01:04:08.409 --> 01:04:11.278
Good for business, Bella.

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.246
<i>Something
about him was familiar.</i>

01:04:13.248 --> 01:04:14.884
Oh.

01:04:18.353 --> 01:04:22.021
<i>Axel was sad
the way Mack was sad.</i>

01:04:22.023 --> 01:04:24.460
<i>The way Mom was sad.</i>

01:04:28.329 --> 01:04:31.697
<i>I wanted to go have fun
like I did with the pack,</i>

01:04:31.699 --> 01:04:35.034
<i>but Axel didn't understand
that dogs need to play.</i>

01:04:35.036 --> 01:04:37.672
Shh. Easy, girl.

01:04:40.541 --> 01:04:41.974
<i>We kept
each other warm.</i>

01:04:41.976 --> 01:04:43.543
Good dog.

01:04:43.545 --> 01:04:45.380
<i>He made sure
I was never hungry.</i>

01:04:46.514 --> 01:04:48.550
Good dog, Bella.

01:04:57.059 --> 01:04:58.961
<i>Slowly,
the air got warmer.</i>

01:05:02.998 --> 01:05:06.101
<i>But Axel got
sadder and sadder.</i>

01:05:14.876 --> 01:05:18.880
<i>I didn't think Axel would ever
take me off the leash.</i>

01:05:41.103 --> 01:05:43.804
<i>I didn't like being chained.</i>

01:05:43.806 --> 01:05:46.472
<i>It didn't feel right.</i>

01:05:46.474 --> 01:05:50.813
<i>I didn't know how to help Axel
and still take care of myself.</i>

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:54.715
<i>I needed to do Go Home.</i>

01:05:54.717 --> 01:05:56.249
I love you.

01:05:56.251 --> 01:05:57.787
It's just me and you.

01:06:00.889 --> 01:06:04.090
You're the only friend
I've got.

01:06:04.092 --> 01:06:06.092
I love you, Bella.

01:06:06.094 --> 01:06:08.461
I love you.

01:06:08.463 --> 01:06:09.764
It's you and me, Bella.

01:06:10.465 --> 01:06:11.467
You and me.

01:06:15.637 --> 01:06:19.237
Bella,
I love you.

01:06:19.239 --> 01:06:21.608
I love you, Bella.

01:06:21.610 --> 01:06:22.745
I love you.

01:06:33.922 --> 01:06:38.157
<i>I laid with Axel while the
heat slowly drained away from him,</i>

01:06:38.159 --> 01:06:40.760
<i>until there was no more Axel</i>

01:06:40.762 --> 01:06:43.398
<i>and he was no longer sad.</i>

01:07:03.485 --> 01:07:05.617
<i>I sat, being a good dog,</i>

01:07:05.619 --> 01:07:07.922
<i>thinking someone
would come for me.</i>

01:07:13.362 --> 01:07:14.963
<i>Nobody came.</i>

01:07:19.768 --> 01:07:22.003
<i>Being a good dog didn't work.</i>

01:07:38.454 --> 01:07:41.590
<i>It was as if the whole world
had forgotten me.</i>

01:07:43.291 --> 01:07:45.960
<i>But I couldn't give up.</i>

01:07:55.704 --> 01:07:57.440
<i>I was so thirsty.</i>

01:08:00.275 --> 01:08:02.644
<i>I needed water.</i>

01:08:44.786 --> 01:08:46.988
<i>Okay, Bella,
this is very important.</i>

01:08:48.323 --> 01:08:49.656
You ready? All right.

01:08:49.658 --> 01:08:50.993
Go home.

01:08:52.225 --> 01:08:54.194
That's it.

01:08:55.497 --> 01:08:56.895
Go home, Bella.

01:08:56.898 --> 01:08:58.631
<i>Go home.</i>

01:08:58.634 --> 01:08:59.899
Come on,
there's a cool path down here.

01:08:59.902 --> 01:09:01.834
Hey, wait! Wait for me!

01:09:01.836 --> 01:09:04.673
- Hurry up. You're always slow.
- No, I'm not.

01:09:09.243 --> 01:09:11.479
Hey, look. A dog.

01:09:12.814 --> 01:09:14.182
People.

01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:20.553
- What's the matter with it?
- I don't know.

01:09:20.555 --> 01:09:21.988
Careful it doesn't
have rabies.

01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:24.057
Doesn't have rabies,
you moron.

01:09:24.059 --> 01:09:26.625
It's stuck. Good dog.

01:09:26.627 --> 01:09:28.894
Good dog.

01:09:28.895 --> 01:09:30.032
It's chained to something.

01:09:39.407 --> 01:09:40.840
- What... What is it?
- There's a body over there.

01:09:40.841 --> 01:09:42.241
No way.

01:09:42.243 --> 01:09:44.343
- The dog's chained to it.
- Is he dead?

01:09:44.345 --> 01:09:45.346
I think so.

01:09:47.649 --> 01:09:48.783
What are
you gonna do?

01:09:49.783 --> 01:09:50.752
Good dog.

01:09:59.226 --> 01:10:01.162
<i>Water never
tasted so good.</i>

01:10:12.739 --> 01:10:16.910
<i>I knew now that my journey was
much longer than I'd ever imagined.</i>

01:10:16.912 --> 01:10:18.678
<i>Two winters.</i>

01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:22.048
<i>How many more winters
would there be?</i>

01:10:22.050 --> 01:10:24.220
<i>And how many more
could I take?</i>

01:10:39.234 --> 01:10:41.968
<i>Their smell was everywhere.</i>

01:10:49.144 --> 01:10:50.679
<i>They were
hunting me again.</i>

01:10:57.219 --> 01:10:59.018
<i>I knew they would come.</i>

01:11:01.722 --> 01:11:04.589
<i>But I wasn't gonna let them
think I was afraid.</i>

01:13:07.180 --> 01:13:08.783
Is that...

01:13:30.137 --> 01:13:32.138
It is Big Kitten.

01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:34.510
And she's a big,
big kitten now.

01:14:17.217 --> 01:14:20.521
<i>It felt so good
to be together again.</i>

01:14:22.323 --> 01:14:25.057
<i>And I could tell
Big Kitten felt the same.</i>

01:14:48.716 --> 01:14:52.285
<i>I knew Lucas would be
excited to meet Big Kitten.</i>

01:14:52.287 --> 01:14:55.423
<i>And we would all
sleep together in the bed.</i>

01:14:59.327 --> 01:15:03.131
<i>Lucas was definitely
gonna need a bigger bed.</i>

01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:08.402
Now,
that's a new smell.

01:15:17.679 --> 01:15:19.715
I don't know what those are,
and I don't want to know.

01:15:28.655 --> 01:15:29.725
Big Kitten!

01:15:53.948 --> 01:15:55.981
There it is.

01:15:55.983 --> 01:15:58.253
Go Home and Lucas.

01:16:06.394 --> 01:16:09.161
<i>Big Kitten wanted me
to follow her,</i>

01:16:09.163 --> 01:16:10.731
<i>and I wanted her to follow me.</i>

01:16:23.778 --> 01:16:26.912
<i>I knew then that Big Kitten
would not be coming home with me</i>

01:16:26.914 --> 01:16:27.983
<i>to sleep on the bed.</i>

01:16:38.525 --> 01:16:42.063
I will always be
your mother cat.

01:16:56.912 --> 01:16:58.480
<i>I loved Big Kitten.</i>

01:17:00.582 --> 01:17:02.415
<i>But I knew I would
never see her again.</i>

01:18:10.283 --> 01:18:12.951
Oh! A dog!

01:18:12.953 --> 01:18:14.920
Puppy, come here!
Come here, puppy!

01:18:14.922 --> 01:18:17.322
Come here! Come here, puppy!

01:18:17.324 --> 01:18:18.559
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:18:19.527 --> 01:18:21.660
Just stop. Please.

01:18:21.662 --> 01:18:23.795
What's happening?

01:18:23.797 --> 01:18:25.430
- Come on.
- Please stop.

01:18:25.432 --> 01:18:27.465
- Here, boy.
- Come here.

01:18:27.467 --> 01:18:28.737
Come here, girl. Come here.

01:19:08.877 --> 01:19:10.942
Come here, baby.

01:19:13.948 --> 01:19:17.786
<i>It hurt so much,
but I had to keep going.</i>

01:19:30.265 --> 01:19:33.401
<i>The streets and the houses
started to look familiar.</i>

01:19:39.306 --> 01:19:41.408
<i>I finally did
what Lucas told me.</i>

01:19:42.210 --> 01:19:45.247
<i>I did Go Home.</i>

01:19:57.891 --> 01:19:59.959
Lucas! Mom!

01:19:59.961 --> 01:20:02.097
- Who's there?
- Lucas!

01:20:03.463 --> 01:20:04.897
Oh, oh.

01:20:04.899 --> 01:20:06.799
Okay, you can't be
in here. Come on.

01:20:06.801 --> 01:20:08.233
Come on. Right,
let's go outside.

01:20:08.235 --> 01:20:10.602
<i>Everything
was different.</i>

01:20:10.604 --> 01:20:11.937
Come on. Come on.

01:20:11.939 --> 01:20:13.304
I'll give you a treat
if you come outside.

01:20:13.306 --> 01:20:15.441
Lucas? Mom?

01:20:15.443 --> 01:20:17.043
Goodness.

01:20:17.045 --> 01:20:19.777
Where were they?

01:20:19.779 --> 01:20:22.982
There's a stray dog that just
pushed its way into my house.

01:20:22.984 --> 01:20:27.489
<i>I could smell they had
been gone for a long, long time.</i>

01:20:34.561 --> 01:20:39.000
<i>I tried so hard,
and I'd come so far.</i>

01:20:40.835 --> 01:20:44.105
<i>I just couldn't
take another step.</i>

01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:55.414
Mother Cat?

01:20:55.416 --> 01:20:57.552
How did you
get so small?

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:07.395
- Call about a stray dog?
- I did.

01:21:09.596 --> 01:21:10.865
- You.
- You.

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:24.346
<i>Mother Cat watched me
leave, just like Big Kitten did.</i>

01:21:28.750 --> 01:21:30.952
<i>I guess that's how
cats say goodbye.</i>

01:21:41.695 --> 01:21:45.233
<i>There was just one more place
to look for Lucas.</i>

01:21:46.935 --> 01:21:48.834
- That's good.
- Later.

01:21:48.836 --> 01:21:51.072
- See you.
- Bye.

01:22:03.716 --> 01:22:05.584
- Dogs?
- Yeah, that's a good boy.

01:22:05.586 --> 01:22:07.255
I used to
be the only one.

01:22:10.625 --> 01:22:12.058
- Um, Olivia?
- What?

01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:13.892
I think a stray dog
just came through.

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:22.366
The alarm goes off,
I get up.

01:22:22.368 --> 01:22:23.637
I got somewhere to go.

01:22:24.505 --> 01:22:25.940
I like the job.

01:22:36.518 --> 01:22:37.484
No way.

01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:43.789
Can't be.

01:22:51.733 --> 01:22:52.734
Bella?

01:22:54.269 --> 01:22:57.072
It is her! Come here!
Come here, girl.

01:23:00.541 --> 01:23:02.010
What happened to you, girl?

01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:08.350
What? What is it?

01:23:11.485 --> 01:23:13.520
- No.
- Lucas?

01:23:15.655 --> 01:23:16.658
It can't be.

01:23:17.324 --> 01:23:18.824
Bella!

01:23:36.109 --> 01:23:38.512
Lucas, Lucas, Lucas!

01:23:40.681 --> 01:23:43.650
Bella,
Bella! You're alive.

01:23:48.890 --> 01:23:50.522
I can't believe it.

01:23:50.524 --> 01:23:52.391
Bella, where have you
been all this time?

01:23:52.393 --> 01:23:54.992
- Is that Bella?
- Yeah, it is. It really is.

01:23:54.994 --> 01:23:56.628
Bella!

01:23:56.630 --> 01:23:58.630
Oh, my God. It's been
like two and a half years.

01:23:58.632 --> 01:24:01.968
- Hi.
- Lucas! Olivia! Mom!

01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:03.568
I did Go Home!

01:24:03.570 --> 01:24:05.573
- She came home.
- I know, I know.

01:24:15.182 --> 01:24:16.883
Can you call the vet,
tell him we're on the way?

01:24:16.885 --> 01:24:19.085
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I'll get the car.

01:24:19.087 --> 01:24:22.223
Lucas? Lucas, there's an officer outside
who says you have to bring that dog out.

01:24:24.192 --> 01:24:25.193
I'm so sorry.

01:24:26.661 --> 01:24:27.662
Come on.

01:24:28.695 --> 01:24:29.697
You kidding?

01:24:31.131 --> 01:24:32.630
All right, everybody.

01:24:32.632 --> 01:24:35.034
No big deal.
Nothing to worry about.

01:24:35.036 --> 01:24:36.968
I'm just here
for that pit bull.

01:24:36.970 --> 01:24:39.303
And if any
of you interfere,

01:24:39.305 --> 01:24:41.840
these officers,
they will arrest you.

01:24:41.842 --> 01:24:43.875
We don't want any trouble,

01:24:43.877 --> 01:24:47.545
but we have to
take that animal.

01:24:47.547 --> 01:24:49.682
I thought I'd see why
half the department

01:24:49.684 --> 01:24:52.817
is out here on a routine
Animal Control call.

01:24:52.819 --> 01:24:54.887
Anybody want to fill me in?

01:24:54.889 --> 01:24:58.322
Captain, I'm here for a confiscation,
and some of these people,

01:24:58.324 --> 01:25:01.093
they're trying to turn it
into some kind of a situation.

01:25:01.095 --> 01:25:05.196
It's obstruction,
harboring a dangerous animal,

01:25:05.198 --> 01:25:07.098
and disobeying
a lawful order.

01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:09.567
Uh-huh.

01:25:09.569 --> 01:25:13.207
Well, which one of you is
responsible for this crime spree?

01:25:16.444 --> 01:25:18.546
I thought it might be
something like that.

01:25:20.713 --> 01:25:22.380
That a pit bull?

01:25:22.382 --> 01:25:24.083
Doesn't look like
a pit bull to me.

01:25:24.085 --> 01:25:27.585
She's my dog, sir,
and she's hurt.

01:25:27.587 --> 01:25:29.053
I'm taking her to the vet.

01:25:29.055 --> 01:25:30.755
Well, I'm sorry to tell you
that Chuck's right.

01:25:30.757 --> 01:25:33.090
We have to take your dog
in to the shelter.

01:25:33.092 --> 01:25:35.259
All right.

01:25:35.261 --> 01:25:37.161
But to do so,
you've got to go through

01:25:37.163 --> 01:25:39.565
the 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine
Division, United States Marine Corps.

01:25:39.567 --> 01:25:41.266
1st Infantry, Army.

01:25:41.268 --> 01:25:44.070
82nd Airborne Division,
U.S. Army.

01:25:44.072 --> 01:25:45.905
6th Fleet, United States Navy.

01:25:45.907 --> 01:25:48.639
101st Airborne,
Screaming Eagles.

01:25:48.641 --> 01:25:51.977
4th Infantry Division,
United States Army.

01:25:51.979 --> 01:25:53.780
You really want
this thing to escalate?

01:25:54.615 --> 01:25:55.617
Do you?

01:25:57.751 --> 01:26:01.086
Ma'am, my job is
to enforce the law,

01:26:01.088 --> 01:26:03.955
and the law says
I've got to impound this dog.

01:26:03.957 --> 01:26:06.424
Now, if that means
Tasers and pepper spray,

01:26:06.426 --> 01:26:08.160
then that's what it means.

01:26:08.162 --> 01:26:10.129
Under Denver city
ordinance 8-...

01:26:10.131 --> 01:26:11.332
Wait.

01:26:14.001 --> 01:26:15.267
He said "Denver."

01:26:15.269 --> 01:26:16.237
That's right.

01:26:17.436 --> 01:26:18.870
But this isn't Denver.

01:26:18.872 --> 01:26:21.505
- This is federal property.
- It's what?

01:26:21.507 --> 01:26:23.776
The VA Hospital
is federal property.

01:26:23.778 --> 01:26:27.812
It isn't technically a part
of the City of Denver.

01:26:27.814 --> 01:26:29.781
So, that's it, Captain.

01:26:29.783 --> 01:26:31.519
There doesn't have to be a fight,
'cause you don't have jurisdiction.

01:26:32.752 --> 01:26:33.720
Hmm.

01:26:36.157 --> 01:26:39.023
So, where did you two serve?

01:26:39.025 --> 01:26:40.561
- Basra.
- Kabul.

01:26:41.462 --> 01:26:42.864
Hue, Tet Offensive.

01:26:45.198 --> 01:26:48.800
All right. Show's over.
Let's pack it up.

01:26:48.802 --> 01:26:50.669
Yeah.

01:26:50.671 --> 01:26:53.606
If I see this dog leave the
premises, I will pull your car over.

01:26:53.608 --> 01:26:55.540
No, you won't.

01:26:55.542 --> 01:26:58.177
Chuck, I get more
complaints about you

01:26:58.179 --> 01:27:02.214
than all the other
ACOs combined.

01:27:02.216 --> 01:27:04.552
Turn that vehicle in.
I'm pulling you out of the field.

01:27:06.354 --> 01:27:11.359
And nobody is pulling
anyone over for a dog.

01:27:12.827 --> 01:27:14.028
Got it?

01:27:14.795 --> 01:27:15.829
Good.

01:27:20.466 --> 01:27:22.733
Oh, my gosh, Bella,
we missed you so much.

01:27:22.735 --> 01:27:24.736
I don't understand
what just happened,

01:27:24.738 --> 01:27:27.241
but I'm pretty sure
it was good.

01:27:38.118 --> 01:27:40.885
Oh, look what
I found in the chest.

01:27:40.887 --> 01:27:42.353
I totally forgot.

01:27:42.355 --> 01:27:44.290
- Come here.
- Remember this, Bella?

01:27:44.292 --> 01:27:47.558
My Lucas blanket!

01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:50.428
- I wanted to try something.
- Yeah.

01:27:50.430 --> 01:27:53.365
This was her favorite thing
when she was little.

01:27:53.367 --> 01:27:57.268
But after all she's been through,
I don't know if she'll remember.

01:27:57.270 --> 01:28:00.873
Bella, do you want...

01:28:00.875 --> 01:28:05.309
- A tiny piece of cheese.
- ...a tiny piece of cheese?

01:28:07.814 --> 01:28:08.983
She does remember.

01:28:11.719 --> 01:28:13.619
She's an amazing dog.

01:28:13.621 --> 01:28:15.422
She really is.

01:28:24.265 --> 01:28:26.598
<i>I was really home</i>

01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:29.037
<i>with Lucas, and Olivia, too.</i>

01:28:31.438 --> 01:28:34.639
<i>I was where I needed to be.</i>

01:28:45.552 --> 01:28:48.454
<i>And Big Kitten was
where she needed to be.</i>

01:29:12.313 --> 01:29:14.012
<i>I finally understood</i>

01:29:14.014 --> 01:29:16.113
<i>that the invisible leash
that led me to Lucas</i>

01:29:16.115 --> 01:29:18.150
<i>was made of love.</i>

01:29:18.152 --> 01:29:20.518
<i>He was my person.</i>

01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:23.523
<i>And I was his dog.</i>
