WEBVTT

00:00.017 --> 00:01.347
Look, guys, he's just a kid.

00:01.418 --> 00:02.407
He's a prince.

00:02.485 --> 00:03.475
He's a target.

00:05.656 --> 00:06.680
There he is.

00:07.391 --> 00:08.756
The King says he's gonna play.

00:08.826 --> 00:09.850
You know, it sounds like...

00:09.927 --> 00:12.157
maybe you ought to be protecting
him from his father, too.

00:14.698 --> 00:17.223
I want you to give me asylum.
Political asylum.

00:20.037 --> 00:21.095
He's been kidnapped.

00:21.172 --> 00:23.766
And you are, at least,
partly responsible.

00:25.176 --> 00:26.268
They're gonna kill him.

01:43.521 --> 01:45.955
Come on, Joey, you can do it.

01:47.124 --> 01:49.558
Yeah. Let's go. Let's go. Come
on, let's get it over with.

02:11.182 --> 02:12.376
Hey, batter, batter.

02:12.450 --> 02:13.712
Hey, batter, batter.

02:18.622 --> 02:20.920
Come on, Danny.

02:20.992 --> 02:23.358
Come on.
Go, Danny, go.

02:25.196 --> 02:26.185
Where's he going?

03:10.741 --> 03:12.572
Danny, Danny!

03:13.044 --> 03:14.375
Danny!

03:18.049 --> 03:19.641
I'm sorry, Danny.

03:19.984 --> 03:22.111
But you gotta learn
to stop running away.

03:22.186 --> 03:24.586
Hey, it's in my blood.

03:25.423 --> 03:27.220
That's just it. Your blood.

03:28.225 --> 03:31.422
This way, Your Highness.
Back to the game.

03:51.816 --> 03:53.875
Not like that, Benny!

03:56.053 --> 03:57.918
Like that. Okay?

03:58.456 --> 03:59.923
Come on, you gotta
keep your head in.

03:59.990 --> 04:01.617
Don't bail out
on the inside fastball...

04:01.692 --> 04:03.159
or else you'll never hit it.

04:03.227 --> 04:05.593
You try it, okay?
Okay, Mr. Calvin.

04:08.232 --> 04:09.221
Benny!

04:09.967 --> 04:11.332
Benny.

04:11.402 --> 04:12.391
Yeah.

04:13.104 --> 04:15.072
Hey, all right! That's it.

04:15.139 --> 04:16.401
That's the way.

04:16.774 --> 04:18.241
All right, keep it going,
keep it going.

04:18.309 --> 04:19.367
Everybody's gonna come in...

04:19.442 --> 04:21.172
for some batting practice, okay?

04:23.247 --> 04:24.908
Nice hit, T.C.
Hey.

04:24.982 --> 04:27.644
You really took that
eight-year-old kid downtown.

04:27.718 --> 04:30.209
Oh, come on, man. I was
just trying to teach Benny...

04:30.287 --> 04:32.585
how to hang in there,
against the hard stuff, and...

04:32.656 --> 04:35.454
Of course. Bet you it
felt good though, huh?

04:38.796 --> 04:40.525
You know, he would
hang in there better...

04:40.598 --> 04:42.589
if he had some rubber
cleats instead of sneakers.

04:42.666 --> 04:44.133
Don't have any cleats.

04:44.201 --> 04:46.192
Folks can't afford them.

04:46.270 --> 04:49.535
And each kid's gotta provide
his own cleats and cup.

04:49.607 --> 04:51.074
League rules.

04:56.547 --> 04:57.912
I got it. I got it.

04:58.115 --> 04:59.173
You're spying.

05:00.818 --> 05:02.285
What are you talking about?

05:02.353 --> 05:04.218
I'm having a nice afternoon
in the park...

05:04.288 --> 05:06.347
watching some kids
play ball with my friend.

05:06.423 --> 05:08.323
Hey, when you're done,
let's shag some flies.

05:08.392 --> 05:10.690
You're spying.
T.C.

05:10.794 --> 05:13.763
You're spying
for them Jororo guys.

05:13.831 --> 05:16.299
I am not spying
for those Jororo guys.

05:16.367 --> 05:17.891
Well, then, how come
their whole team...

05:17.968 --> 05:19.731
is staying at Robin's Nest
and you're here?

05:19.803 --> 05:21.862
The whole team is not
staying at Robin's Nest.

05:21.939 --> 05:23.463
Just the center fielder.
The prince.

05:23.541 --> 05:24.530
The prince?

05:24.608 --> 05:26.633
The rest of the team is
staying at a hotel in Waikiki.

05:26.710 --> 05:28.143
Robin just thought
it'd be better...

05:28.212 --> 05:31.181
because of what almost happened
to his dad a couple of years ago...

05:31.248 --> 05:34.081
if the kid stayed out at the
estate, and it'd be safer.

05:34.718 --> 05:35.946
Yeah. And convenient.

05:36.020 --> 05:39.080
Especially since my All-Stars
are playing those guys...

05:39.156 --> 05:42.455
in the International Goodwill
Tournament next Saturday.

05:42.526 --> 05:44.323
Hey, those guys beat Taiwan.

05:44.395 --> 05:46.886
Well, they certainly don't
need any help from me.

05:46.964 --> 05:49.057
Besides, I haven't
even met the prince yet.

05:49.133 --> 05:51.294
Well, you will. 'Cause
you're his bodyguard.

05:51.368 --> 05:53.336
I am not
his bodyguard, T.C.

05:53.404 --> 05:54.962
He's got his own security.

05:55.039 --> 05:56.336
Listen, I have nothing...

05:56.407 --> 06:00.400
repeat, nothing to do with
the Jororo team or the prince.

06:02.146 --> 06:03.738
Everybody, stop.

06:03.881 --> 06:06.475
Stop, everybody.
Come here, come here.

06:07.284 --> 06:10.549
Everybody, quit playing until he leaves.

06:10.621 --> 06:12.748
You leave. Out!
Leave.

06:12.823 --> 06:14.688
You really believe I'd spy?

06:14.758 --> 06:19.092
I don't want to hear it.
Turncoat! Traitor!

06:19.163 --> 06:23.099
Why don't you go on back to your
rich boys, your prince, your cleats-

06:23.167 --> 06:24.156
Okay.

06:24.668 --> 06:28.160
Okay, if that's what
you really want, I'll go.

06:29.206 --> 06:32.039
I mean, if you really think
I would stoop so low...

06:32.109 --> 06:34.976
as to spy on my best friend's
Youth League team...

06:35.045 --> 06:38.139
in favor of strangers,
of foreigners...

06:39.049 --> 06:40.516
then I'll leave.

06:40.951 --> 06:42.919
I just want you
to know, T.C...

06:42.987 --> 06:46.946
that it's going to be a long time
before I'm able to forget this.

06:47.925 --> 06:51.486
I just thought we knew each
other a little better, that's all.

06:54.098 --> 06:55.190
Bye, guys.

06:55.266 --> 06:56.665
Bye. See you later.

06:56.734 --> 06:58.634
<i>I love baseball.</i>

07:04.508 --> 07:06.476
All right!
What are you guys looking at?

07:06.543 --> 07:09.239
Get back out there in
the field and play ball.

07:15.886 --> 07:18.411
Thomas, what is the
bird's-eye view on this caper?

07:18.489 --> 07:19.513
Huh?

07:19.590 --> 07:23.026
Who's gonna win? I got a lot
of big bucks on this game.

07:24.561 --> 07:26.188
Jororo, 3-to-1.

07:26.330 --> 07:28.992
Whoa! I thank you and
Ice Pick thanks you.

07:29.066 --> 07:30.055
Hey!

07:30.234 --> 07:33.397
Rick! Come on, I was just
kidding. I made it up.

07:34.471 --> 07:35.460
Fool.

07:35.539 --> 07:37.734
<i>It's funny how when
you get a bunch of adults...</i>

07:37.808 --> 07:38.866
<i>around a kid's game...</i>

07:38.942 --> 07:41.103
<i>it all of a sudden
is not a game anymore.</i>

07:41.178 --> 07:44.204
<i>And then when you have a kid who
happens to be a prince involved...</i>

07:44.281 --> 07:47.478
<i>they really start playing for
keeps. Security guards. Tutors.</i>

07:47.551 --> 07:49.712
<i>I hoped all this wouldn't go
to His Highness's head.</i>

07:49.787 --> 07:51.550
<i>I mean, I wondered
if little Danny played...</i>

07:51.622 --> 07:53.419
<i>with a batting helmet
or a crown.</i>

07:53.490 --> 07:54.923
<i>Or if things
didn't go his way...</i>

07:54.992 --> 07:57.722
<i>would he just take
his country and go home?</i>

08:00.331 --> 08:03.198
Hey! You must
be... I mean, Your Highness.

08:03.267 --> 08:05.997
That's lame, man.
My name's Danny.

08:07.671 --> 08:09.935
You live here?
Yeah.

08:10.941 --> 08:12.408
Quite a place, huh?

08:12.476 --> 08:13.602
Big deal.

08:13.677 --> 08:17.272
You could fit this dump in
one corner of my backyard.

08:18.015 --> 08:19.004
Oh.

08:19.216 --> 08:21.013
Well, it's nice
meeting you, Danny.

08:21.085 --> 08:22.313
Good luck with your game.

08:22.386 --> 08:24.115
Hey, wait a second.

08:24.288 --> 08:27.223
Isn't this an Al Kaline glove? Yeah.

08:27.291 --> 08:29.054
Well, so is mine.

08:29.360 --> 08:32.260
Hey, that's great.
He gave it to me himself.

08:32.830 --> 08:34.229
He did?
Yeah.

08:34.298 --> 08:38.394
Al was in Jororo last year, stopped
by the palace and laid it on me.

08:38.534 --> 08:40.559
Well, then you're
a Tiger fan, huh?

08:40.636 --> 08:43.400
Twins. You want to shag some flies?

08:43.807 --> 08:45.035
It's getting to be a drag...

08:45.109 --> 08:47.600
throwing this against
the pitchback all day.

08:47.678 --> 08:49.578
Thanks. Maybe some
other time, Danny.

08:49.646 --> 08:52.809
Look, if you're bugged at
what I said about your pad...

08:52.883 --> 08:54.248
I'm sorry, okay?

08:54.685 --> 08:57.586
I guess everybody's got to
make do with what they've got.

08:57.654 --> 09:00.020
No offense, okay?
Fine.

09:00.224 --> 09:03.660
Fine, except, this isn't my pad.

09:03.727 --> 09:06.525
My pad is out back.
I just kind of work here.

09:06.597 --> 09:08.792
Then you're not Robin Masters?

09:10.634 --> 09:11.623
No.

09:11.869 --> 09:13.530
I'm Thomas Magnum.

09:13.604 --> 09:14.593
Oh.

09:15.839 --> 09:17.568
Well, how about it?

09:17.708 --> 09:19.938
Will you shag some flies anyway?

09:20.344 --> 09:22.608
Okay, hop in.
Except, let's go out back.

09:22.679 --> 09:25.045
I know a place where
there's a lot less trees.

09:25.115 --> 09:27.447
Thanks, Magnum.
You're all right.

09:32.523 --> 09:34.787
Hey, listen, you sure
nobody's going to miss you?

09:34.858 --> 09:36.257
You kidding?

09:36.593 --> 09:38.117
<i>I'll call the
police immediately...</i>

09:38.195 --> 09:39.719
and alert them to
the lad's disappearance.

09:39.797 --> 09:41.025
Wait.

09:41.165 --> 09:43.759
Hold it till my men search
the grounds completely.

09:43.834 --> 09:46.701
I don't want this leaking
to the press prematurely.

09:46.770 --> 09:49.864
I mean, all Jororo needs is
another international incident.

09:49.940 --> 09:51.931
Mr. Russler, while I
realize that your position...

09:52.009 --> 09:54.068
as head of security
for the Jororo delegation...

09:54.144 --> 09:56.704
entails other
peripheral considerations...

09:56.780 --> 09:59.943
mine here, as head of security
at Robin's Nest, does not.

10:00.017 --> 10:01.678
I am notifying the police.

10:01.752 --> 10:04.186
Higgins, please. I don't
want to pull rank on you.

10:04.254 --> 10:06.188
Then don't. You have
absolutely no-

10:06.256 --> 10:08.690
Hey, guys, guys.

10:09.126 --> 10:10.718
Look, I'm just
a baseball coach...

10:10.794 --> 10:12.125
but I know Danny pretty good...

10:12.196 --> 10:14.027
and I think you're both overreacting.

10:14.097 --> 10:16.258
The kid runs away all the
time and we always find him.

10:16.333 --> 10:19.063
All the more reason a tighter
rein should be kept on him.

10:19.136 --> 10:21.001
Look, you stick to
the hit and run...

10:21.071 --> 10:22.231
and you, Miss Peardon...

10:22.306 --> 10:24.069
to the biology
and practical math.

10:24.141 --> 10:25.733
And perhaps you,
Mr. Russler...

10:25.809 --> 10:27.572
should apply yourself
to current events.

10:27.644 --> 10:29.111
Like what?

10:31.949 --> 10:33.246
Magnum.

10:33.317 --> 10:34.579
Danny.

10:34.651 --> 10:36.778
Hello, Russler.
It's been a long time.

10:36.854 --> 10:38.617
Magnum, explain yourself.

10:38.689 --> 10:39.713
Explain what?

10:39.790 --> 10:41.314
Explain what you were
doing with the prince.

10:41.391 --> 10:42.983
Where the hell were you?

10:43.060 --> 10:44.084
Shagging flies.

10:44.161 --> 10:46.152
Magnum, your entomological
proclivities...

10:46.230 --> 10:47.424
are not at issue.

10:47.498 --> 10:51.332
Rather, your callous disregard for
the safety and security of this lad is.

10:51.401 --> 10:54.461
Higgins, we were chasing
fly balls. Baseball.

10:54.538 --> 10:56.199
I thought you said
it was all right.

10:56.273 --> 10:57.604
I was wrong.

10:57.941 --> 10:58.999
Okay.

10:59.076 --> 11:01.476
Miss Peardon, will you
see Danny to his room?

11:01.545 --> 11:02.807
Danny.

11:03.413 --> 11:05.176
See you at practice, kid.

11:05.249 --> 11:06.409
Maybe.

11:06.517 --> 11:08.542
Thanks for the catch.
Sure.

11:11.655 --> 11:13.555
Mr. Lum, I believe the
rest of your team's...

11:13.624 --> 11:15.114
waiting for you at the hotel.

11:20.330 --> 11:22.423
I'm sorry.
He didn't explain.

11:22.499 --> 11:24.194
Okay, I'll explain.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.835
There've been repeated threats
on the prince's security...

11:27.905 --> 11:29.395
during his stay here
in Hawaii...

11:29.473 --> 11:32.931
and I've only got two men to
keep an eye on the little...

11:33.443 --> 11:35.570
I don't need you
to make my job any harder.

11:35.646 --> 11:37.341
Like he did last time?

11:38.048 --> 11:39.538
As I recall...

11:40.017 --> 11:44.181
Magnum was quite instrumental in thwarting
the assassination of the lad's father.

11:44.855 --> 11:47.415
Okay. This time don't do me any favors.

11:47.624 --> 11:49.387
I can take care of
the situation myself.

11:49.459 --> 11:50.687
What situation?

11:50.794 --> 11:53.786
Look, I was playing catch
with the kid in a secure area.

11:53.864 --> 11:56.025
I think you're
overreacting just a bit.

11:56.099 --> 11:57.691
I mean, after all, he is a kid.

11:58.135 --> 11:59.966
Actually, Magnum, he's a prince.

12:00.037 --> 12:01.834
Wrong. He's a target.

12:08.345 --> 12:10.074
<i>Russler may have been right.</i>

12:10.147 --> 12:11.512
<i>Maybe Danny was a target...</i>

12:11.582 --> 12:13.550
<i>but it was pretty hard
to imagine...</i>

12:13.617 --> 12:15.278
<i>someone taking
potshots at a kid...</i>

12:15.352 --> 12:18.753
<i>whose only crime was having
a parent somebody didn't like.</i>

12:18.822 --> 12:20.050
<i>I don't know.</i>

12:20.123 --> 12:24.025
<i>Maybe if I had to live like that,
maybe I'd be trying to run away, too.</i>

12:24.094 --> 12:26.927
Magnum, what have you
done with him this time?

12:27.297 --> 12:28.730
What are you talking about?

12:28.799 --> 12:30.460
I haven't done
anything with him.

12:30.534 --> 12:32.525
I've been working
on my surf ski, alone.

12:32.603 --> 12:35.003
Great! Turn this place upside down.

12:35.772 --> 12:38.400
Go ahead. This time
you can call the cops.

12:38.475 --> 12:41.467
Danny Lin's gone again.
This time it's for real.

12:41.545 --> 12:43.206
Well, I'll check the south lawn.

12:43.280 --> 12:46.147
Wait a minute, Magnum. You're
not going to check anything.

12:46.216 --> 12:48.309
You're gonna stay
the hell out of this.

12:59.528 --> 13:01.519
<i>Despite what Russler told me...</i>

13:01.597 --> 13:04.862
<i>I promised Higgins I'd help
search the grounds for Danny.</i>

13:04.934 --> 13:09.166
<i>He was kind of upset that I seemed to be
taking the whole situation so easily.</i>

13:09.238 --> 13:11.866
<i>But when your little voice is
telling you that just maybe...</i>

13:11.941 --> 13:16.002
<i>everyone's overreacting to
another princely prank, why panic?</i>

13:16.578 --> 13:18.705
<i>Because the punchline
can't be too far away.</i>

13:26.121 --> 13:28.282
I hope that's not my last beer.

13:28.357 --> 13:29.415
No.

13:29.491 --> 13:31.254
You have another
half bottle left.

13:31.327 --> 13:33.295
It was kind of flat, though.

13:33.462 --> 13:35.430
Kind of like this chili.

13:36.131 --> 13:37.996
That chili was from...

13:39.568 --> 13:42.093
last Tuesday.
I hope it's all right.

13:42.338 --> 13:45.739
That's okay. I haven't
had chili in years.

13:46.675 --> 13:49.041
Louise Peardon says
it's not good for me.

13:49.111 --> 13:50.635
She's always on my case.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.609
All right!
What?

13:53.682 --> 13:55.650
Hrbek just doubled in two.

13:56.151 --> 13:58.176
Twins, two.
Tigers, zippola.

13:58.654 --> 14:00.315
What inning?
First.

14:04.460 --> 14:06.724
Well, there's still
a long way to go.

14:11.133 --> 14:12.532
Okay, Danny.

14:13.035 --> 14:14.832
You want to tell me
what you're doing here?

14:14.903 --> 14:17.531
Louise Peardon said you were
a private investigator.

14:17.606 --> 14:19.005
You figure it out.

14:19.074 --> 14:20.166
Danny.

14:20.242 --> 14:23.336
Did it ever occur to you, you're
making a lot of people uptight?

14:23.412 --> 14:26.006
A lot of people are
making me uptight.

14:26.181 --> 14:28.081
It's like I'm in jail
or something.

14:28.150 --> 14:31.916
I'm in Hawaii and I can't even
stay at the hotel with my teammates.

14:31.987 --> 14:33.818
I'm stuck here
with my hag tutor...

14:33.889 --> 14:37.120
and Dr. FBI.
Give me a break.

14:41.864 --> 14:43.627
What are you going to do?

14:43.699 --> 14:46.532
Turn me in for watching a
ball game and having a beer?

14:46.635 --> 14:48.330
You're not supposed
to drink beer.

14:49.505 --> 14:51.735
Okay, okay.
Just checking.

14:52.441 --> 14:54.807
And I am going to tell them
where you are. It's only fair.

14:54.877 --> 14:57.004
Don't talk to me
about fair, Magnum.

14:57.079 --> 14:58.774
I'm the Prince of Jororo.

14:58.847 --> 15:00.610
Born lucky, I guess.

15:03.052 --> 15:06.385
Danny, you can't keep
running away from it.

15:06.688 --> 15:09.316
Besides, where are you
going to run to?

15:09.491 --> 15:12.790
Someplace where nobody
wants to blow my head off.

15:13.595 --> 15:15.563
What about
Haight-Ashbury?

15:15.864 --> 15:18.560
You think the flower
children would take me in?

15:18.634 --> 15:20.226
Flower children?

15:20.302 --> 15:21.963
Sure, the hippies.

15:23.238 --> 15:24.227
Danny.

15:24.973 --> 15:27.066
There aren't any
hippies anymore.

15:27.743 --> 15:29.836
There aren't?
No. I mean...

15:30.012 --> 15:32.310
where do you get all this stuff?

15:32.648 --> 15:34.240
Flower children?
Your slang?

15:34.316 --> 15:35.840
You don't talk like a prince.

15:35.918 --> 15:38.011
It all went out of style
a long time ago.

15:38.087 --> 15:42.956
Hey, when you grow up alone in a
palace in Jororo with six color TV's...

15:43.258 --> 15:45.123
you make do with what you get.

15:45.194 --> 15:48.425
<i>The Mod Squad, Welcome
Back, Kotter, Shindig.</i>

15:48.931 --> 15:52.833
You mean, you learned to talk
like that from television reruns.

15:55.571 --> 15:58.335
Will you let me watch the
rest of the game with you?

15:58.407 --> 16:01.274
Sure. But I'm going to let
them know where you are.

16:01.944 --> 16:04.845
That won't be necessary.
Okay, Danny...

16:08.050 --> 16:09.608
up to your room.

16:13.422 --> 16:15.754
Magnum, from here on in, the
prince is off limits to you.

16:15.824 --> 16:16.984
Stay away from him.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.287
Stay away from him!

16:18.360 --> 16:21.261
Yeah, you're the big kid.
And Miss Peardon...

16:21.330 --> 16:24.822
next time, try not to fall for
the dummy-in-the-bed trick.

16:24.900 --> 16:27.460
Hey, let me know
what the score was.

16:27.536 --> 16:29.163
Yeah, sure, Danny.

16:30.706 --> 16:32.298
Magnum.

16:33.675 --> 16:36.007
I'll tell you what the score is.

16:36.245 --> 16:38.805
We just got a kidnap
threat from the opposition.

16:38.881 --> 16:41.008
They said they're going
to get him, here in Hawaii.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.449
Well, no one's going to
kidnap him in my room.

16:43.519 --> 16:45.146
Thanks.
I appreciate that.

16:45.220 --> 16:47.017
Look, he's either safe on
the estate, or he isn't.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.057
If he's safe in the main
house, he's safe here.

16:49.124 --> 16:50.648
It's the game I'm worried about.

16:50.726 --> 16:52.023
Well, then, pull him.

16:52.094 --> 16:55.188
Daddy says no.
National honor, pride.

16:55.330 --> 16:57.662
Oh, come on!
He's a 12-year-old kid.

16:57.733 --> 16:59.963
Whose security
I'm paid to guarantee.

17:00.035 --> 17:01.696
Then how come you're
losing him all the time.

17:01.770 --> 17:03.704
Well, maybe you'd like to.
- Magnum!

17:03.772 --> 17:06.935
Okay. Okay, Russler,
do your job! Whatever it is.

17:07.009 --> 17:08.499
Magnum, really.

17:11.246 --> 17:13.214
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

17:13.281 --> 17:15.807
Just remember that security
here is my problem, too.

17:15.884 --> 17:18.647
Now if you want to let me know what's
going on, then maybe I can help.

17:18.720 --> 17:20.847
Otherwise, you got no right
to come in here...

17:20.923 --> 17:24.188
and come down on me for watching
a ball game with a little kid.

17:24.259 --> 17:26.750
At least, these guys are
grownups pretending they're kids.

17:26.828 --> 17:28.021
You've got it
the other way around.

17:28.096 --> 17:30.656
<i>Whitaker lines one
into the gap in right center field.</i>

17:30.732 --> 17:31.756
<i>Trammell scores easily.</i>

17:31.833 --> 17:34.063
<i>Here comes Herndon rounding
second and now rounding third.</i>

17:34.136 --> 17:37.731
<i>Here comes the relay. It's going
to be close. It's not in time!</i>

17:37.806 --> 17:41.867
Good for the Tigers, bad for the
Yankees. Thanks a lot, Minnesota.

17:43.645 --> 17:45.510
Go away. We're closed.

17:46.848 --> 17:48.907
Mr. Calvin,
it's me, Benny.

17:49.585 --> 17:50.984
What are you doing here?

17:51.053 --> 17:53.886
We got a practice game against
that Jororo team tomorrow.

17:53.956 --> 17:56.789
You should be at home
getting your school work out.

17:56.858 --> 17:58.325
Yeah, I know.

18:02.731 --> 18:06.599
Look, you're worried about the inside fastball,
just give me a few minutes here...

18:06.668 --> 18:08.602
and we'll go out back
and I'll throw you some.

18:08.670 --> 18:10.501
No, it's not the fastball.

18:10.572 --> 18:13.769
I think I can hit
anybody now, even you.

18:14.176 --> 18:16.406
I just don't think
I can play anymore.

18:16.478 --> 18:18.912
Why? Are you sick? You
got into trouble in school?

18:18.981 --> 18:20.039
No.

18:21.750 --> 18:24.810
What? What is it
you want to tell me, Benny?

18:26.054 --> 18:28.113
If you want to watch
the game, that's fine.

18:28.190 --> 18:31.284
Just be quiet. I got a truckload
of paperwork to get out and...

18:31.360 --> 18:32.554
I quit.

18:37.666 --> 18:38.894
What?

18:38.967 --> 18:40.400
You quit? What do you mean you quit?

18:40.469 --> 18:43.165
You haven't missed a game or
a practice in over three years.

18:43.238 --> 18:47.334
I know, but my folks need me to
help out with my brothers and sister.

18:47.409 --> 18:50.845
I got to get an extra job
after school and on weekends.

18:50.912 --> 18:54.177
And there just isn't going to be
any time for me to play on the team.

18:54.249 --> 18:55.511
Do your folks know this?

18:55.584 --> 18:59.384
Uh-huh. They're sorry, but
the family's got to come first.

18:59.454 --> 19:01.820
I thought you had a job
at Wong's Grocery Store?

19:01.890 --> 19:05.519
I do, but I got to take on a
paper route starting tomorrow.

19:06.061 --> 19:07.619
Or we're not going to make it.

19:20.142 --> 19:21.268
You know...

19:22.077 --> 19:25.979
I don't think you're going to make it
unless you have a chance to be a kid.

19:26.048 --> 19:27.982
You know when
I was growing up...

19:28.050 --> 19:32.009
I knew a lot of kids that had to
work to help their families out.

19:32.921 --> 19:34.320
I was lucky.

19:34.690 --> 19:37.158
I had a coach that
didn't want me to miss...

19:37.225 --> 19:39.193
the best part of being a kid.

19:39.494 --> 19:41.553
That was playing
with your friends...

19:41.630 --> 19:44.463
doing something that was fun
and sharing it with your buddies.

19:44.533 --> 19:47.366
Now there's gonna be plenty of
time for work and responsibility...

19:47.436 --> 19:50.405
and you're going to get
your share of it. Believe me.

19:50.672 --> 19:53.368
Well, Mr. Calvin,
what am I going to do?

19:53.942 --> 19:55.136
Well...

19:55.277 --> 19:58.303
first of all, you're going to
have to stop looking so disgusted.

19:58.380 --> 20:01.508
And then second, you're going to have
to stay late after practice tomorrow...

20:01.583 --> 20:03.551
and help me get rid
of some newspapers.

20:03.618 --> 20:06.143
You mean that, bro?
Heck, yeah, bro.

20:06.221 --> 20:08.189
We take the van,
throw the kind...

20:08.256 --> 20:10.315
be through in no time,
like that.

20:14.796 --> 20:16.161
Okay, guys.

20:48.563 --> 20:50.087
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

20:50.165 --> 20:52.827
<i>Russler told me
to stay away from the kid.</i>

20:52.901 --> 20:54.892
<i>Well, I was, sort of.</i>

20:55.303 --> 20:58.295
<i>But I really wanted to see
the practice game.</i>

20:58.707 --> 21:00.834
<i>Besides,
despite the tough-guy image...</i>

21:00.909 --> 21:03.002
<i>Danny tried to project,
underneath it...</i>

21:03.078 --> 21:05.842
<i>was a little kid
I kind of liked a lot.</i>

21:06.081 --> 21:08.208
<i>And I was worried about him.</i>

21:08.283 --> 21:10.945
<i>And about more than
just his batting average.</i>

21:25.150 --> 21:26.879
Here we go.

21:31.790 --> 21:32.848
One!

21:32.924 --> 21:33.913
Strike one!

21:35.560 --> 21:37.050
Nice day, huh?
Uh-huh.

21:37.696 --> 21:40.392
It's great to see those
kids out there in the sun...

21:40.465 --> 21:43.161
having a good time,
playing their hearts out...

21:43.234 --> 21:45.998
having good, clean,
innocent fun.

21:46.071 --> 21:47.060
Yeah.

21:47.238 --> 21:48.500
It's really very nice.

21:48.573 --> 21:50.438
I mean, it's really refreshing.

21:51.443 --> 21:52.933
Especially
in this day and age...

21:53.011 --> 21:55.138
when kids can get into
all sorts of stuff...

21:55.213 --> 21:56.703
that can get them into trouble. Uh-huh.

21:56.781 --> 21:58.214
Like gambling.
Uh-huh.

21:58.283 --> 22:00.478
Rick, there is nobody out
there over 12 years old...

22:00.552 --> 22:01.712
and you're acting
as a bookie for-

22:01.786 --> 22:02.946
Hey, don't even say it.

22:02.992 --> 22:04.716
You know, I really resent this, Thomas.

22:04.789 --> 22:07.519
For your information, Ice Pick
and I got a gentleman's wager.

22:07.592 --> 22:09.719
And furthermore, we both
agreed that whoever wins...

22:09.794 --> 22:11.819
kicks into
the Oahu Orphans Home.

22:11.896 --> 22:13.329
And one other thing...

22:13.398 --> 22:15.662
this is a recipe
for Veal Marsala...

22:15.734 --> 22:17.361
for my mother back in Chicago.

22:24.242 --> 22:25.266
Strike two.

22:25.343 --> 22:28.335
Come on, Danny, you can do it.

22:31.349 --> 22:33.180
Come on, let's go, pitcher.

22:36.020 --> 22:38.511
Come on! Get it.
Get it! Pick it up!

22:43.862 --> 22:44.851
Out!

22:45.230 --> 22:47.095
That tag was high, man.

22:47.265 --> 22:48.755
Don't push me.

22:58.643 --> 23:01.134
Hey. Easy.

23:02.514 --> 23:04.539
Hold it.
Easy.

23:04.616 --> 23:06.777
He kicked my legs out
from under me.

23:06.851 --> 23:08.819
This dummy tagged me
in the face.

23:08.887 --> 23:10.616
I think he broke
a tooth or something.

23:10.688 --> 23:12.781
Hey. Come on,
you guys, now.

23:13.558 --> 23:15.116
There's no call for
you guys to be fighting.

23:15.193 --> 23:16.387
This is just a practice game.

23:16.461 --> 23:19.430
Yeah? Well, tell him to lighten
up with his flying elbow.

23:19.497 --> 23:21.465
The only thing flying
was your feet.

23:21.533 --> 23:23.524
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey!

23:23.601 --> 23:25.501
All right, that's it. Benny,
you're out of the game.

23:25.570 --> 23:26.901
And that goes for you, Danny.

23:29.207 --> 23:30.799
Hey, only one thing.

23:31.109 --> 23:33.304
Why don't you two
shake hands first?

23:43.121 --> 23:46.488
I think you two need to go over there
and sit on the grass for a while.

23:46.558 --> 23:48.753
Together?
You heard him.

24:02.674 --> 24:04.335
Boys will be boys.

24:13.852 --> 24:15.376
Strike one!

24:15.587 --> 24:17.418
I remember once,
back in Chicago...

24:17.488 --> 24:19.353
we were playing
stickball under the "L."

24:19.424 --> 24:20.857
And me and this guy,
Eddie Spivak...

24:20.925 --> 24:23.587
we get into it as to who was
going to play on the tracks or not.

24:23.661 --> 24:25.026
Pretty soon this...

24:27.065 --> 24:29.090
Go. Go. Go! Go!

24:41.479 --> 24:43.344
That's it.
Jororo wins.

24:44.282 --> 24:46.546
You think they could win
like this on Saturday?

24:46.618 --> 24:47.744
Who knows, Rick?

24:47.819 --> 24:49.252
The beauty of baseball is...

24:49.320 --> 24:51.811
that an infinite variety
of things can happen...

24:51.890 --> 24:53.585
at any given time.

24:54.192 --> 24:56.524
Um, does that mean
Ice Pick could lose?

24:58.463 --> 24:59.930
Good game.
Thanks, T.C.

24:59.998 --> 25:01.465
Oh, hey, thanks.

25:01.532 --> 25:03.090
Hey, maybe we'll get you Saturday.

25:03.167 --> 25:06.136
Better not, or the King
might probably cut me.

25:06.204 --> 25:10.106
Hey, I hope not like the San
Francisco Giants did to you in '74.

25:10.174 --> 25:13.666
No, like Robespierre
did to Louis XV in '89.

25:14.412 --> 25:16.903
He couldn't hit
a curve ball, either.

25:16.981 --> 25:18.573
They take their Youth League...

25:18.650 --> 25:20.140
pretty seriously in Jororo.

25:20.218 --> 25:22.243
I feel more pressure
in coaching these kids...

25:22.320 --> 25:24.686
than I did trying to
make it in the majors.

25:24.756 --> 25:26.417
Just a game, right?
Right.

25:26.491 --> 25:27.583
Nice game, guys.

25:27.659 --> 25:29.320
Hiya, Magnum.
Here have a drink.

25:29.394 --> 25:30.418
Oh, thank you.

25:30.495 --> 25:32.622
Both teams are going over to
Ala Moana Park for a luau...

25:32.697 --> 25:34.756
and then to the
Aloha Arcade Center.

25:34.832 --> 25:36.561
You're welcome to join us.

25:36.634 --> 25:39.432
Thanks, I'd like to, but I gotta
do some work back at the estate.

25:39.504 --> 25:41.335
Okay. I guess I'll see
you back there later.

25:41.406 --> 25:42.532
Okay.
Let's go, guys.

25:42.607 --> 25:44.404
I challenge you to
a game of Rockets and Robots.

25:44.475 --> 25:48.206
Sure, sounds great. Hey,
coach, you know he's a prince?

25:48.279 --> 25:49.473
Hey, man.

25:49.547 --> 25:51.640
Okay, okay, I won't mention it anymore.

25:51.716 --> 25:52.944
Appreciate it.

25:53.017 --> 25:55.611
Just show me how you roast
marshmallows at the luau.

25:55.687 --> 25:57.484
I've never done that before.

25:57.555 --> 26:00.023
Sure, Prince...
I mean, Danny. Sure.

26:00.091 --> 26:01.718
Then we'll hit the arcade. All right.

26:01.793 --> 26:03.852
I don't think so, Danny.

26:03.928 --> 26:06.692
I'm sorry, but I'm not taking
any unnecessary chances.

26:06.764 --> 26:08.561
His Highness has
to go back to the estate.

26:17.908 --> 26:19.500
<i>I still
know what you're thinking.</i>

26:19.577 --> 26:21.738
<i>Since when would I turn down
a free luau...</i>

26:21.812 --> 26:23.803
<i>to do some work
back at the estate?</i>

26:23.881 --> 26:25.508
<i>And since when
would I be worrying...</i>

26:25.583 --> 26:28.416
<i>about something that everybody
in no uncertain terms...</i>

26:28.486 --> 26:29.885
<i>told me wasn't my case?</i>

26:30.387 --> 26:31.820
<i>Almost everybody.</i>

26:31.889 --> 26:34.722
<i>Everybody,
except my little voice.</i>

26:34.959 --> 26:38.827
<i>Only thing was, I couldn't
understand what it was saying.</i>

26:49.773 --> 26:51.764
Ambush! Stay down.

27:54.786 --> 27:55.878
<i>One of the nice things...</i>

27:55.954 --> 27:57.387
<i>about living in paradise
is that...</i>

27:57.455 --> 28:00.288
<i>no matter how tough
or confusing things get...</i>

28:00.358 --> 28:02.383
<i>you can always escape
into the water.</i>

28:02.527 --> 28:04.461
<i>Its warmth goes
right through you...</i>

28:04.529 --> 28:06.360
<i>cleansing away your troubles...</i>

28:06.431 --> 28:09.491
<i>sometimes making you feel
just like a kid again.</i>

28:09.768 --> 28:12.760
<i>Except in Danny's case,
he was a kid.</i>

28:13.405 --> 28:17.034
<i>A 12-year-old who not only wasn't
getting much of a shot at being a kid...</i>

28:17.108 --> 28:21.044
<i>he also wasn't getting a hell of a lot
of chances of making it to 13 either.</i>

28:21.112 --> 28:22.704
<i>And even if he did...</i>

28:22.781 --> 28:26.615
<i>I wondered whether a childhood spent
dodging bullets instead of fastballs...</i>

28:26.684 --> 28:28.879
<i>wouldn't make Danny into one
of those two-bit dictators...</i>

28:28.953 --> 28:31.353
<i>who like to push his people
around just to get even.</i>

28:31.423 --> 28:32.583
Magnum.

28:34.492 --> 28:36.392
Hey, Danny, how you doing?

28:36.461 --> 28:39.089
Me? Never been better.
We gotta rap.

28:39.898 --> 28:41.525
Beat it, Russler.

28:43.234 --> 28:45.395
Come on, pal, we made a deal.

28:45.470 --> 28:46.459
Mmm-hmm.

28:52.477 --> 28:55.446
His Highness says he isn't going
to play in the game tomorrow...

28:55.513 --> 28:58.004
unless he gets
to talk to you first.

28:59.884 --> 29:01.749
Maybe that's not
such a bad idea.

29:04.489 --> 29:05.751
Maybe you're right.

29:05.824 --> 29:09.885
Only I really don't have any choice in
the matter, and neither does the kid.

29:09.961 --> 29:11.553
The King says he's gonna play.

29:11.629 --> 29:12.926
You know it sounds like...

29:12.997 --> 29:15.932
maybe you ought to be protecting
him from his father, too.

29:16.000 --> 29:19.060
Yeah, right again. Except
then, who'd protect me?

29:19.804 --> 29:22.398
Talk to him, Magnum.
Please.

29:23.541 --> 29:25.099
Okay, I'll talk to him.

29:25.610 --> 29:28.875
But, don't expect me to
try to convince him to play.

29:36.554 --> 29:38.215
Hey, Danny, look...

29:38.490 --> 29:41.084
I know stuff like
what happened yesterday...

29:41.159 --> 29:43.525
is kind of difficult
to deal with, you know...

29:43.595 --> 29:44.857
and to accept, and...

29:44.929 --> 29:47.454
Hey, hey. It comes
with the territory.

29:47.665 --> 29:50.156
I mean, I already heard
all that from them.

29:50.235 --> 29:51.725
I guess they want me
to get used...

29:51.803 --> 29:53.430
to having dudes
trying to off me.

29:53.505 --> 29:56.804
So I don't need to hear the
same jive from you, okay?

29:57.408 --> 29:58.466
Okay.

29:59.043 --> 30:01.773
Now, I asked them
to let me talk to you...

30:01.846 --> 30:04.007
because you're the only
person around here...

30:04.082 --> 30:05.845
that makes any sense.

30:05.984 --> 30:08.282
I think you may be the
only person around here...

30:08.353 --> 30:09.843
who's really my friend.

30:09.921 --> 30:12.219
And I know you're the
only person around here...

30:12.290 --> 30:14.258
with an Al Kaline glove.

30:14.792 --> 30:16.760
You gotta help me, Magnum.

30:16.828 --> 30:17.988
Please.

30:18.062 --> 30:19.154
What do you want me to do?

30:19.898 --> 30:21.661
I want you to give me asylum.

30:21.733 --> 30:24.725
What? You know, political asylum.

30:24.836 --> 30:27.134
I read about it
in a magazine once.

30:27.205 --> 30:30.368
That'd solve all my problems. Asylum.

30:30.441 --> 30:33.137
That's the ticket, Magnum.
Can you do it?

30:33.211 --> 30:35.304
Danny, I can't give you asylum.

30:35.380 --> 30:38.406
Sure you can,
right here at the estate.

30:38.583 --> 30:40.346
I know it's kind of small,
but...

30:40.418 --> 30:43.353
But it's not a country.

30:43.988 --> 30:45.512
I am not a country.

30:45.590 --> 30:49.686
I can't give you asylum here.
I can't even get asylum here.

30:49.961 --> 30:51.792
What are you talking about?

30:51.863 --> 30:53.455
I thought we were pals.

30:53.531 --> 30:56.227
I thought you understood
what's happening.

30:56.301 --> 30:57.461
Danny...

30:58.636 --> 31:01.867
I'll talk to Russler, and
maybe he can talk to your dad.

31:01.940 --> 31:05.137
And what?
And what's my dad going to do?

31:05.476 --> 31:08.309
He's the one who sent
me to this damn game.

31:08.613 --> 31:09.978
Then don't play.

31:10.048 --> 31:12.448
I got to.
They're making me.

31:13.051 --> 31:16.043
The only chance I've got
is for you to hide me out.

31:16.120 --> 31:17.712
I can't do that.

31:17.789 --> 31:21.350
Then I'm history,
walking history.

31:22.260 --> 31:23.693
I'll be just another chapter...

31:23.761 --> 31:27.162
in one of those dumb books
Louise Peardon makes me read.

31:27.932 --> 31:31.424
"Prince Danny Lin.
Assassinated, July."

31:33.271 --> 31:34.533
Forget it!

31:34.872 --> 31:36.840
I should've known better.

31:37.709 --> 31:40.678
Thanks for nothing.
Russler.

31:42.614 --> 31:44.639
<i>I sure wish I was the prince.</i>

31:44.716 --> 31:47.310
What? What are you
talking about, Benny?

31:47.385 --> 31:49.910
I'm just thinking that
if I had my own country...

31:49.988 --> 31:52.456
I wouldn't have to be
doing this menial labor.

31:52.523 --> 31:53.888
Who's doing menial labor?

31:54.826 --> 31:58.455
I mean, me and you. I'd give
you special compensation.

31:58.796 --> 32:00.787
You mean dispensation?

32:00.865 --> 32:02.423
Yeah, something like that.

32:02.500 --> 32:06.436
You know, so you won't have to bust your
butt so bad on this small-time stuff.

32:06.504 --> 32:08.028
Hey, wait a minute.
Watch your language.

32:08.106 --> 32:09.471
And what's wrong with my work?

32:09.540 --> 32:11.804
Well, any work? I mean
work's good for you.

32:11.876 --> 32:13.741
I thought you said I
was supposed to be a kid.

32:13.811 --> 32:17.770
Oh, yeah, sure. But work's a part
of it. It's just not all of it.

32:19.817 --> 32:21.307
Not like that!

32:21.386 --> 32:24.617
You gotta get more wrist
into it. Get more zip on it.

32:24.689 --> 32:26.554
Get those suckers right
up there on the porch...

32:26.624 --> 32:27.989
where the people
don't have to...

32:28.059 --> 32:30.391
walk outside to the
sidewalk and get them.

32:30.461 --> 32:33.362
And then they don't get all
wet when the sprinklers come on.

32:33.431 --> 32:35.160
Hey, now.
That's better.

32:35.233 --> 32:37.861
There you go. Now you
got the hang of it.

32:42.707 --> 32:45.904
Benny, you don't want to
be somebody else, do you?

32:46.277 --> 32:47.869
Well...
Well what?

32:48.046 --> 32:51.482
Man, you've got to be happy being
who you are, not who you aren't.

32:51.549 --> 32:54.780
You gotta work at being the
best possible Benny R. Lee...

32:54.852 --> 32:56.547
you can possibly be.

32:56.621 --> 32:59.590
I mean, you'll find that most folks
generally have more problems than...

32:59.657 --> 33:01.784
you've ever even thought of.

33:02.093 --> 33:03.390
I'll tell you something, Benny.

33:03.461 --> 33:05.019
You're really lucky to be you.

33:10.134 --> 33:12.227
All right, Benny, let her rip.

33:14.105 --> 33:16.733
Not that way, man!

33:16.808 --> 33:19.402
I told you, you gotta
get more wrist into it.

33:19.477 --> 33:20.842
Where's the next house?

33:20.912 --> 33:21.970
On the corner.

33:22.046 --> 33:23.513
Okay, give me
one of those papers.

33:23.581 --> 33:26.243
I'm gonna show you how I used
to do it when I was a kid.

33:26.317 --> 33:28.376
Of course, we had to
do it on a bicycle...

33:28.453 --> 33:29.715
but anyway...

33:36.361 --> 33:40.092
"After 39 days of
being surrounded and starved out..."

33:40.164 --> 33:42.359
"by the hideously painted
cannibals..."

33:42.433 --> 33:45.061
"our major finally
agreed to surrender."

33:45.636 --> 33:47.297
"The seven of us
that were left..."

33:47.372 --> 33:49.738
"were taken to the encampment
of their leader..."

33:49.807 --> 33:53.334
"who was quite insistent that we
all be cooked to a slow boil."

33:54.045 --> 33:55.376
Wait, lads.

33:56.514 --> 33:59.540
Now, pay attention.
This is the meaty part.

34:02.353 --> 34:05.811
"However, our major,
Lord Tewksbury..."

34:05.890 --> 34:08.484
"who also happened to be
the ninth Earl of Whitney..."

34:08.559 --> 34:11.027
"protested this
summary simmering..."

34:11.094 --> 34:13.996
"and challenged the cannibal
king to a fight to the death."

34:14.831 --> 34:17.562
"The prize being,
if he won, our freedom."

34:18.136 --> 34:19.933
"Fortunately,
the king was convinced..."

34:20.004 --> 34:22.699
"that a battle between two
soldiers of royal blood..."

34:22.774 --> 34:26.676
"would be a true test of the
superiority of our respective races."

34:27.078 --> 34:29.706
"As the punji sticks were
sharpened... Oh, Higgins."

34:29.781 --> 34:31.873
"And honed to a
fine point... Higgins."

34:31.949 --> 34:34.440
"the Major and the King
readied themselves for the fight."

34:34.518 --> 34:35.884
Higgins.
What is it, Magnum?

34:35.953 --> 34:37.887
You got a minute?
I've got plenty of them.

34:37.955 --> 34:40.719
Unfortunately, they're reserved
for my memoirs, not you.

34:40.792 --> 34:43.226
Sorry, don't let me
get in the way.

34:43.327 --> 34:44.692
This Major Tewksberg...

34:44.762 --> 34:47.731
did he really fight a duel with
cannibals with punji sticks?

34:47.799 --> 34:48.891
Tewksbury.

34:48.966 --> 34:49.955
Whatever.

34:50.034 --> 34:51.728
It's just that...

34:51.803 --> 34:54.498
they don't have
punji sticks in Africa.

34:57.775 --> 34:59.208
What did you want, Magnum?

35:00.845 --> 35:02.642
Well, I guess
I wanted some advice.

35:02.713 --> 35:05.238
I'm sorry, Magnum. My
knowledge of shagging flies...

35:05.316 --> 35:08.479
goes only from the common
house variety to the tsetse.

35:08.553 --> 35:10.487
I've long since given up
trying to understand...

35:10.555 --> 35:12.921
what you Yanks find
so fascinating about a game...

35:12.990 --> 35:16.153
in which most of the time is spent
inserting a digit in one's nostrils

35:16.227 --> 35:17.558
or scratching one's-

35:17.628 --> 35:19.220
Higgins, please.

35:23.534 --> 35:25.399
It's good for my cold.

35:30.441 --> 35:32.375
What's on your mind, Magnum?

35:33.010 --> 35:34.170
Danny.

35:34.745 --> 35:36.372
Quite a brave lad.

35:36.581 --> 35:39.846
Russler informs me that he's
going to play in the game tomorrow.

35:39.917 --> 35:41.077
Good show.

35:41.152 --> 35:43.518
Evidently, His Highness has
a renewed sense of his duty.

35:43.588 --> 35:44.680
I don't think so.

35:44.755 --> 35:46.916
The kid just asked for my
help in getting him out of it.

35:46.991 --> 35:49.323
I turned him down.
As well you should.

35:49.393 --> 35:51.327
The duties and
responsibilities of royalty...

35:51.395 --> 35:53.488
are something that neither
you nor I can alter.

35:53.564 --> 35:56.055
Higgins, in all likelihood,
some more of those crazies...

35:56.133 --> 35:58.567
are gonna try and get at Danny
at the ball game tomorrow.

35:58.636 --> 36:00.399
Now, there's only so much
that Russler...

36:00.471 --> 36:02.996
or any 800 cops can do about it.

36:04.008 --> 36:06.238
I mean, he shouldn't be playing.

36:08.112 --> 36:10.546
Damn it, Higgins.
He asked for my help.

36:14.485 --> 36:16.385
He asked me for asylum.

36:18.289 --> 36:19.847
He wasn't even sure
what it meant.

36:22.293 --> 36:24.761
Go on, Higgins. You got one
of those stories for this one?

36:24.829 --> 36:26.387
What about Major Tewksberg?

36:26.464 --> 36:28.091
Did royal duty prevail?

36:29.267 --> 36:30.757
Actually, yes.

36:31.802 --> 36:34.930
Unfortunately,
it was the cannibal king's.

36:35.172 --> 36:37.538
Major Tewksbury
never knew what hit him.

36:37.608 --> 36:40.771
I remember him turning to me just
before the joust and saying...

36:42.446 --> 36:44.311
What's that?
Matilda.

36:45.816 --> 36:47.306
Sounds like a horse to me.

36:47.385 --> 36:50.115
Actually, it is.
It's Agatha's polo pony.

36:50.254 --> 36:52.279
I promised I'd mind it
for her while she...

36:53.591 --> 36:55.320
My God, it's loose.

37:14.946 --> 37:16.709
<i>We're not
going to find him, man.</i>

37:16.781 --> 37:19.944
Sure we are. Let's go down
towards Waimanelo Beach.

37:20.618 --> 37:23.781
You know, there's only so many places on
this island where a 12-year-old kid...

37:23.854 --> 37:26.015
can ride a horse
without somebody seeing him.

37:26.090 --> 37:28.991
Yeah, and I think we flew
over just about all of them.

37:29.060 --> 37:31.858
Plus the whole town's been up
half the night looking for him.

37:31.929 --> 37:34.659
Yeah, including those bozos
who tried to kidnap him.

37:34.732 --> 37:36.165
What is that?

37:36.667 --> 37:40.159
A whole lot of favors.
Just in case.

37:44.008 --> 37:46.169
You know, I gotta give
it to the little sucker.

37:46.243 --> 37:49.212
Bed sheets out the windows.
Sabotaging all the cars.

37:49.280 --> 37:50.508
Yeah.
Pretty smart.

37:50.581 --> 37:52.071
A real genius.

37:53.117 --> 37:54.482
Well, if he had half a brain...

37:54.552 --> 37:55.849
he wouldn't still be
on that horse.

38:00.358 --> 38:01.347
Uh-oh.

38:02.693 --> 38:04.058
There he is.

38:11.602 --> 38:13.627
Can you put it down
in front of him?

38:13.704 --> 38:14.796
Yeah, I think so.

38:30.454 --> 38:32.251
Whoa. All right, kid.

38:49.587 --> 38:52.215
I hope you guys aren't
too mad. I mean...

38:52.271 --> 38:55.418
he said it was his personal
pony from the Royal Stables.

38:55.493 --> 38:57.085
And you believed him?

38:57.161 --> 39:00.221
Sure. He's a prince.
He got everything.

39:00.498 --> 39:03.160
He even gave me a pair
of new baseball shoes.

39:03.234 --> 39:05.361
Which we are going to return.

39:05.603 --> 39:08.436
How long do you think you could
get away riding that horse?

39:08.506 --> 39:10.371
But I've
never been on one before.

39:10.441 --> 39:12.568
I guess I just wanted to try.

39:14.312 --> 39:16.280
Is Danny in big trouble?

39:16.380 --> 39:18.575
If we don't find him,
he will be.

39:18.950 --> 39:21.942
Do you have any idea
where he might have gone?

39:22.220 --> 39:25.883
Gee, I don't know.
We just traded places.

39:27.225 --> 39:28.749
Has his father been notified?

39:28.826 --> 39:30.657
Yes. The King has
prevailed upon us...

39:30.728 --> 39:33.561
to do everything in our
power to find his son.

39:33.631 --> 39:36.259
Which right now doesn't
look like a whole lot.

39:36.334 --> 39:37.858
I beg your pardon.

39:37.935 --> 39:40.802
Every law enforcement agency
on this island is looking for-

39:40.872 --> 39:44.330
For a 12-year-old Oriental
kid wearing jeans and t-shirt.

39:44.575 --> 39:47.373
Come on, you guys!
What are we waiting for?

39:47.612 --> 39:48.977
For a note.

39:49.313 --> 39:52.612
Undoubtedly, we'll receive
a ransom note in due time.

39:52.683 --> 39:54.207
They'll probably request...

39:54.285 --> 39:57.118
a release of political
prisoners, the usual.

39:57.455 --> 40:00.788
What're you going to do,
Louise? Grade it for grammar?

40:01.158 --> 40:04.218
I don't understand how all of you
can be so cavalier about Danny.

40:04.295 --> 40:05.284
He's gone!

40:05.363 --> 40:07.126
Hold it, both of you.

40:07.632 --> 40:09.532
The one thing we've got going
for us is the fact...

40:09.600 --> 40:11.591
that the opposition doesn't
know where he is either.

40:11.669 --> 40:13.296
Or that he's gone.

40:13.604 --> 40:15.299
Unless there's a leak.

40:24.715 --> 40:27.650
Did Danny tell you
of anything special...

40:27.718 --> 40:29.583
that he wanted to do
when you talked to him?

40:29.654 --> 40:32.145
Like go to a ballgame?
Or the beach?

40:32.290 --> 40:33.518
A movie?

40:33.891 --> 40:35.722
Think, lad. Think.

40:41.632 --> 40:43.099
I don't know.

40:43.234 --> 40:45.031
One thing he did ask me...

40:45.102 --> 40:48.299
if I knew where he could
get $20 worth of quarters.

40:56.080 --> 40:58.071
<i>In my dad's
day, it was pool halls.</i>

40:58.149 --> 41:00.913
<i>Me, I sometimes hung out
in pinball arcades.</i>

41:00.985 --> 41:04.853
<i>And these days, a lot of kids lose
themselves in computer explosions...</i>

41:04.922 --> 41:06.651
<i>of lights and sounds.</i>

41:06.958 --> 41:08.619
<i>But whatever your game...</i>

41:08.693 --> 41:12.151
<i>you could always count on one
thing in places like these.</i>

41:12.229 --> 41:16.063
<i>You could, in the space of a couple
of hours, temporarily escape...</i>

41:16.133 --> 41:18.829
<i>and forget the problems
of the outside world.</i>

41:18.903 --> 41:20.871
Hey, I don't remember nothing.

41:20.938 --> 41:23.338
This place is full of kids
that look like him.

41:23.407 --> 41:25.637
And ask for change of twenties?

41:27.511 --> 41:31.709
Yeah, I remember him now, but
you guys are too late. He's gone.

41:31.782 --> 41:33.807
His dad and his uncle
came and got him.

41:33.884 --> 41:34.908
What?

41:34.986 --> 41:36.510
Yeah, he was a real funny dude.

41:36.587 --> 41:38.646
He kept yelling
they were kidnapping him.

41:38.723 --> 41:41.487
If I had a kid that spent all
his money in a place like this...

41:41.559 --> 41:43.993
Thanks.
I'd bust his chops, too.

41:48.666 --> 41:50.759
He's been kidnapped.
I know.

41:50.935 --> 41:53.529
We just received the phone
call, a list of demands.

41:53.604 --> 41:54.935
They're gonna kill him.

41:55.006 --> 41:57.839
They said if we don't
cooperate with them...

41:57.908 --> 41:59.773
they're gonna send us his ear.

41:59.844 --> 42:02.506
Miss Peardon, we are
conversant with the details.

42:02.580 --> 42:04.878
Perhaps you'd like to
go inside and lie down.

42:04.949 --> 42:06.541
Has the King been notified?

42:06.617 --> 42:08.244
The operator is
placing the call now.

42:08.319 --> 42:10.719
However, we've had some
difficulty making the connection.

42:10.788 --> 42:14.315
Well, maybe I can speed it up.
He and I have a lot to talk about.

42:14.392 --> 42:16.223
And so do you, Louise.

42:17.228 --> 42:20.664
Maybe you'll tell him about those
bed sheets hanging out the window.

42:21.766 --> 42:23.324
What are you suggesting?

42:23.401 --> 42:26.734
Why it's been so impossible
for me to protect that kid.

42:27.738 --> 42:29.330
I'm his teacher.

42:29.540 --> 42:31.974
And a suspect.
Come on, Louise.

42:33.310 --> 42:35.005
Thanks.
Yeah.

42:37.548 --> 42:40.016
I understand his sentiments
perfectly, Magnum.

42:40.084 --> 42:42.518
You see, he's a man
who's about to lose his job.

42:42.586 --> 42:45.111
Perhaps the last
he'll ever have in the field.

42:45.189 --> 42:49.182
After all, going from the CIA to
Jororo is hardly upward mobility.

42:49.660 --> 42:52.390
And you are, at least,
partly responsible.

42:52.463 --> 42:53.487
Me?

42:54.165 --> 42:56.099
Me, responsible?
Partly.

42:56.467 --> 42:59.959
You see, if you hadn't encouraged the
prince in his delusions, perhaps...

43:00.037 --> 43:01.504
Perhaps what?

43:01.672 --> 43:05.369
Perhaps he would have accepted
being a sitting duck in center field?

43:05.443 --> 43:07.604
Where did Ray Lum go?
What?

43:07.845 --> 43:09.403
Ray Lum, the coach.
Where'd he go?

43:09.480 --> 43:10.674
He went back to the hotel.

43:10.748 --> 43:13.012
He said he wanted to be
with the team.

43:15.553 --> 43:16.747
Magnum?

43:17.822 --> 43:19.289
Magnum, where are you going?

43:19.356 --> 43:20.846
To shag a fly.

43:24.228 --> 43:26.662
<i>Except this one
was hit over my head...</i>

43:26.730 --> 43:29.961
<i>and the only hope I had was
getting back on it in time.</i>

43:31.402 --> 43:33.996
<i>I just wished I'd had a
better jump. For instance...</i>

43:34.071 --> 43:36.699
<i>if I'd remembered that Ray Lum
was the only other person...</i>

43:36.774 --> 43:40.642
<i>who knew we were headed back to the estate
the day they made the attempt on Danny...</i>

43:40.711 --> 43:44.613
<i>or that the kidnappers had to be alerted
to the fact that Danny was gone...</i>

43:44.682 --> 43:46.912
<i>and possibly
in a video arcade...</i>

43:55.359 --> 43:59.227
<i>At any rate, it was worth the trip
downtown to his hotel to ask him about it.</i>

43:59.296 --> 44:02.424
<i>But as it turned out,
I didn't have to.</i>

44:05.936 --> 44:09.667
<i>That's because Ray grooved me a
high fat one right down the middle.</i>

44:09.740 --> 44:13.540
Wait a minute!
Never mind. Thanks.

44:14.612 --> 44:18.173
<i>Maybe that's the reason the San
Francisco Giants cut him back in '74.</i>

45:32.590 --> 45:35.218
<i>I know what you're thinking.
The odds weren't great.</i>

45:35.292 --> 45:37.886
<i>There very well might be
a half-dozen terrorists...</i>

45:37.962 --> 45:40.396
<i>with itchy trigger fingers
in that hangar.</i>

45:40.998 --> 45:43.125
<i>But I had two things
going for me.</i>

45:43.334 --> 45:44.961
<i>One was surprise.</i>

46:00.384 --> 46:02.477
<i>Of course, surprise wasn't going
to do me a lot of good...</i>

46:02.553 --> 46:05.078
<i>with them taxiing
straight to Jororo with Danny.</i>

46:24.942 --> 46:27.240
<i>My options
suddenly got very limited.</i>

46:27.311 --> 46:28.801
<i>If I got to the plane in time...</i>

46:28.879 --> 46:30.938
<i>I could try and bring it down
with the Uzi...</i>

46:31.015 --> 46:33.347
<i>but then,
I might also bring down Danny.</i>

46:34.451 --> 46:37.045
<i>Suddenly I knew how
William Tell must have felt.</i>

47:17.895 --> 47:21.058
Operator, get me the Coast
Guard. This is an emergency.

47:24.068 --> 47:27.697
Hey, don't bother. I'm okay.
Nice try, though.

47:27.771 --> 47:29.796
You almost bought it there.

47:30.507 --> 47:31.633
You!

47:31.709 --> 47:34.769
Jumped out the rear cargo door
before they took off.

47:35.713 --> 47:38.045
Danny.
Magnum.

47:42.336 --> 47:44.861
Wait a second.
What are you going to do?

47:44.938 --> 47:47.498
Something I should've done
a long time ago.

47:47.574 --> 47:49.974
No! No!
You can't do this to me!

47:50.043 --> 47:52.204
Who says!
I'm a prince!
