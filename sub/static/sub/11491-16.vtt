00:07.420 --> 00:10.620
CHELSEA: First box goes in my car, the other in the truck.

00:12.880 --> 00:14.720
Guess that's it.

00:14.720 --> 00:16.090
You got everything?

00:16.090 --> 00:17.560
I think so.

00:17.560 --> 00:18.900
I, uh, left the house keys

00:18.900 --> 00:20.430
and the garage clicker by the nightstand.

00:20.430 --> 00:22.080
Thanks.

00:22.450 --> 00:25.440
so you still plan to...move in with your dad?

00:25.480 --> 00:26.630
Just for a while.

00:27.440 --> 00:30.660
- You gonna be okay? - Me? Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:30.690 --> 00:32.750
I mean, I am gonna miss the cat.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.230
You hate Sir Lancelot.

00:35.270 --> 00:37.780
I did at first, but over time I came to find...

00:37.820 --> 00:39.230
Yeah, you're right. I hate that thing.

00:40.640 --> 00:42.690
I put in a change of address at the post office,

00:42.730 --> 00:45.190
but here's my dad's address just in case.

00:45.220 --> 00:47.250
I might be open to a trade.

00:47.280 --> 00:49.610
I'll keep the cat, you take Alan.

00:49.640 --> 00:51.400
Still got his carrier.

00:52.270 --> 00:53.820
Take care of yourself, Charlie.

00:53.850 --> 00:55.300
You do the same.

00:58.850 --> 01:01.710
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

01:01.740 --> 01:03.500
Me, too.

01:12.930 --> 01:15.080
Well, she's gone.

01:15.610 --> 01:17.540
You handled that very maturely.

01:17.580 --> 01:19.200
What are you gonna do?

01:19.240 --> 01:20.680
We tried.

01:20.720 --> 01:22.930
Didn't work. Life goes on. Mmm.

01:22.960 --> 01:24.460
You want a drink?

01:24.490 --> 01:26.910
Nah. Drinking isn't gonna solve anything.

01:28.970 --> 01:30.400
What-what are you doing?

01:30.430 --> 01:31.590
Nothing.

01:32.230 --> 01:33.000
Really?

01:33.040 --> 01:34.630
Doesn't look like nothing.

01:35.270 --> 01:37.060
Where you going?

01:37.910 --> 01:39.630
Out for a swim.

01:39.670 --> 01:41.570
You never go in the water.

01:41.610 --> 01:43.690
That's 'cause I'm not a good swimmer.

01:45.850 --> 01:47.090
You don't think he's gonna...

01:47.120 --> 01:48.380
I don't know.

01:51.340 --> 01:52.490
Charlie, stop this!

01:52.520 --> 01:53.910
Charlie, come back!

01:53.940 --> 01:55.090
It's not that bad!

01:55.130 --> 01:56.950
Come on, Charlie, you still got your family!

01:56.990 --> 01:59.170
Very smart; now he's sprinting.

01:59.890 --> 02:03.890
Damn it, Charlie, get out of that water!

02:03.930 --> 02:05.430
We need to go after him.

02:05.460 --> 02:06.770
Well, don't look at me.

02:06.800 --> 02:08.419
I just ate; I got to wait a half an hour.

02:09.460 --> 02:11.270
Well, I just took a shower and washed my hair.

02:11.300 --> 02:12.470
And this is leave-in conditioner.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.350
Well, what about Jake? Jake's at his mother's.

02:14.350 --> 02:15.290
I wish you give him a call.

02:15.290 --> 02:16.970
There's no time!

02:17.000 --> 02:20.290
Water's really cold.

02:21.860 --> 02:24.950
Just so you know, we were about to come get you!

ALAN: Charlie?

02:57.050 --> 02:58.740
You awake?

02:59.740 --> 03:01.330
Come on, man.

03:02.090 --> 03:03.750
It's time to get up.

03:07.990 --> 03:09.690
Charlie?

03:11.940 --> 03:13.210
What?

03:18.280 --> 03:20.000
I- I didn't see you there.

03:20.530 --> 03:23.890
She was the best thing that ever happened to me, Alan.

03:23.930 --> 03:25.150
I understand.

03:25.180 --> 03:27.270
But you've been up here for two days.

03:27.300 --> 03:29.610
It's time to move on with your life.

03:29.640 --> 03:32.280
There's no life to move on with.

03:32.310 --> 03:33.290
Oh, sure there is.

03:33.330 --> 03:37.960
You've got money, a beautiful home, good looks, all your hair.

03:38.000 --> 03:38.910
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:38.940 --> 03:40.640
I have all the things you don't.

03:41.310 --> 03:44.600
That wasn't really the point I was trying to make, but, uh...

03:45.550 --> 03:49.350
Come on. Come on.

03:49.380 --> 03:50.870
Where are we going?

03:50.900 --> 03:53.050
We are going to get you cleaned up.

03:53.090 --> 03:53.790
No.

03:53.820 --> 03:55.160
No, I can't go in there.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.310
Reminds me too much of Chelsea.

03:57.340 --> 03:58.760
The bathroom?

03:58.790 --> 04:02.590
That's where she used to brush her hair and floss her teeth

04:02.630 --> 04:04.980
and tinkle like a princess.

04:06.100 --> 04:07.080
Okay.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.450
***

04:11.330 --> 04:13.760
I may need a new ficus.

04:17.360 --> 04:19.230
I'm glad you came with me.

04:20.079 --> 04:22.160
You needed to get out of the house.

04:22.190 --> 04:25.460
No, what I need is to be loved again.

04:25.490 --> 04:27.260
Uh, well, I think a good first step

04:27.290 --> 04:29.900
is to stop urinating in the potted plants.

04:31.330 --> 04:33.790
Jake, your dad's here!

04:34.810 --> 04:39.040
Charlie, I was so sorry to hear about you and Chelsea.

04:39.080 --> 04:40.410
Thank you.

04:40.450 --> 04:42.000
I know that breakups can be

04:42.030 --> 04:43.970
very difficult.

04:44.010 --> 04:46.110
Unless you're kicking out your husband of 12 years.

04:46.140 --> 04:48.290
That seemed remarkably easy.

04:48.320 --> 04:50.050
It was.

04:51.520 --> 04:54.400
You know the part that I don't understand, Judith,

04:54.430 --> 04:57.550
is how somebody can tell you that they love you one day,

04:57.590 --> 05:01.320
then turn around and break your heart the next.

05:01.350 --> 05:03.320
Well, relationships are complicated.

05:03.360 --> 05:05.120
People drift apart.

05:05.160 --> 05:06.210
Nobody's to blame.

05:06.250 --> 05:07.410
You blamed me.

05:08.140 --> 05:09.800
It was your fault.

05:10.710 --> 05:12.570
I tried to change,

05:12.610 --> 05:15.310
tried to become the man she wanted me to be,

05:15.350 --> 05:17.460
but it wasn't enough.

05:17.490 --> 05:19.690
Oh, I'm sure there's a part of her

05:19.720 --> 05:21.360
that still loves you very much.

05:21.840 --> 05:23.880
Is there a part of you that still loves me very much?

05:23.920 --> 05:25.150
No.

05:27.630 --> 05:29.210
What's wrong with him?

05:29.250 --> 05:31.720
Your uncle's very upset about his breakup.

05:31.750 --> 05:33.690
Oh, yeah, that sucks.

05:33.720 --> 05:34.500
Can I drive?

05:35.660 --> 05:36.860
Sure. Cool.

05:36.890 --> 05:38.610
Let's go, crybaby.

05:50.290 --> 05:51.960
Hey.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.460
Yeah, hey, kind of busy here.

05:55.780 --> 05:56.840
I can see that.

05:56.870 --> 05:58.710
Hi, I'm Jake's Uncle Charlie.

05:58.740 --> 05:59.450
Nicole.

05:59.490 --> 06:00.830
So what's the deal, Nicole?

06:00.860 --> 06:02.650
Are you tutoring our little genius here?

06:03.200 --> 06:04.890
No, we're dating.

06:04.930 --> 06:06.540
Oh. Dating?

06:06.570 --> 06:07.180
Uncle Charlie?

06:07.220 --> 06:08.260
Hang on.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.230
Listen, Nicole, I love this kid,

06:12.270 --> 06:13.670
and I don't want to see him get hurt.

06:13.710 --> 06:15.460
I'm not gonna hurt him.

06:15.500 --> 06:18.030
Oh, really? So you like him just the way he is?

06:18.060 --> 06:19.710
You don't want to change him at all?

06:19.750 --> 06:20.360
Uncle Charlie...

06:20.400 --> 06:22.050
I got your back here, buddy.

06:23.380 --> 06:25.110
'Cause let me tell you something.

06:25.140 --> 06:27.230
This here is a lump of clay.

06:28.390 --> 06:31.620
And you know what it's gonna be five, ten, 20 years from now?

06:31.660 --> 06:34.490
A larger, more bitter lump of clay.

06:34.520 --> 06:35.770
Come on, let's go.

06:35.810 --> 06:37.250
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm not done.

06:37.290 --> 06:39.550
So if you're gonna dump him, dump him now.

06:39.580 --> 06:40.960
Don't wait till he falls in love with you

06:40.990 --> 06:42.440
and asks you to marry him and have his children!

06:45.590 --> 06:47.460
Okay, enjoy yourselves!

06:51.800 --> 06:53.930
Are you out of your mind?

06:53.960 --> 06:55.540
I mean well.

06:56.830 --> 06:59.220
You think maybe it's time to go back to your shrink?

06:59.260 --> 07:01.720
Why? She's just another woman that wants to change me.

07:01.750 --> 07:02.940
Well, you have to do something.

07:02.970 --> 07:04.070
No, no.

07:04.840 --> 07:06.320
If I can't have Chelsea,

07:06.360 --> 07:07.420
I don't want to live.

07:07.450 --> 07:08.750
W- Where you going?

07:08.780 --> 07:10.040
Strip club.

07:12.600 --> 07:13.860
Ah, yes.

07:13.900 --> 07:15.560
Death by lap dance.

07:44.230 --> 07:45.430
Hey, Lord.

07:45.460 --> 07:46.630
It's Charlie.

07:47.580 --> 07:50.560
I know it seems like I only call on you when my ass is on fire,

07:51.660 --> 07:53.780
but, well, let's face it,

07:53.810 --> 07:55.190
that's how you made me.

07:56.510 --> 08:01.150
Anyway, I'm just hurting real bad since Chelsea left,

08:01.160 --> 08:03.060
I was kinda of hoping that maybe you could

08:03.100 --> 08:04.990
take away some of that pain.

08:05.590 --> 08:07.560
Even with the help of your blessed wine,

08:07.590 --> 08:09.200
I can't get through the day.

08:09.240 --> 08:11.610
Even your blessed vodka's stopped working.

08:13.230 --> 08:17.260
So, anything you can do would be much appreciated.

08:17.740 --> 08:19.500
WOMAN: Hey.

08:19.530 --> 08:21.570
You got a light?

08:22.210 --> 08:24.100
I like a little buzz before I pray.

08:24.140 --> 08:25.580
Gets me closer to God.

08:26.990 --> 08:29.010
(whispers): Thanks.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.840
Come on, Charlie, answer the phone.

08:37.870 --> 08:39.110
Ugh, damn it.

08:39.140 --> 08:39.710
Voice mail.

08:39.750 --> 08:41.580
Uh, Charlie, it's me again.

08:41.610 --> 08:42.710
It has been three days.

08:42.740 --> 08:44.570
Please call and let us know you're okay.

08:46.060 --> 08:47.420
I think we should call the police.

08:47.450 --> 08:48.760
Nah, he'll turn up.

08:48.790 --> 08:51.150
May be broke and riddled with gonorrhea,

08:51.190 --> 08:52.970
but he'll find his way home.

08:53.010 --> 08:55.900
No, I-I don't think this is a typical bender.

08:55.930 --> 08:57.270
He really cared for Chelsea.

08:57.310 --> 08:59.500
You know, he put her in his will.

08:59.950 --> 09:02.150
Anything happens to him, she gets everything.

09:02.180 --> 09:03.250
Really?

09:03.290 --> 09:06.870
So, like if he swam out in the ocean and drowned, for instance,

09:06.910 --> 09:08.040
she gets the house?

09:08.070 --> 09:09.790
The house, the Mercedes,

09:09.830 --> 09:11.870
the bank accounts, music royalties.

09:11.910 --> 09:13.670
Man, I just can't catch a break.

09:15.360 --> 09:17.470
Hey, look what someone threw away.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.790
Uh, put that back outside.

09:20.830 --> 09:22.380
And wash your hands.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.260
Welcome to your new home, baby.

09:29.080 --> 09:30.820
Hey, everybody.

09:30.850 --> 09:32.520
I want you to meet the love of my life,

09:32.550 --> 09:34.180
Mrs. Charlie Harper.

09:36.110 --> 09:38.720
Better put me down. I'm not wearing panties.

09:39.830 --> 09:42.290
I told you he'd come home with gonorrhea.

09:43.490 --> 09:45.270
All right, who's who?

09:45.910 --> 09:47.530
Well, this is my brother Alan.

09:47.560 --> 09:48.810
Alan, Betsy.

09:48.840 --> 09:50.030
Hello, brother.

09:50.800 --> 09:52.220
Call me Alan.

09:52.250 --> 09:53.410
Okay.

09:53.450 --> 09:55.550
He doesn't look like such a mooch.

09:56.530 --> 09:58.230
Okay, well, this is my mom Evelyn,

09:58.230 --> 10:00.980
and she doesn't look like such an Antichrist.

10:01.020 --> 10:03.340
Hi, Mom.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.870
Call me Mrs. Harper.

10:07.410 --> 10:08.780
This is my housekeeper Berta.

10:08.780 --> 10:10.970
Don't call me at all.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.340
And lastly, this is Jake.

10:13.950 --> 10:16.830
Oh, are you my son?!

10:17.600 --> 10:20.210
I'll be whatever you want me to be.

10:21.820 --> 10:23.250
Um, actually, he's my son.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.270
Butt out, Dad.

10:25.510 --> 10:27.910
Well, you've met everybody.

10:27.950 --> 10:31.010
Why don't we go upstairs and continue the honeymoon.

10:31.040 --> 10:33.060
(gasps) We have an upstairs?

10:33.100 --> 10:34.610
CHARLIE: Yep.

10:34.650 --> 10:36.290
Are there people up here, too?

10:40.650 --> 10:42.250
I like her.

10:46.660 --> 10:49.070
Hey, Dad. Mm-hmm?

10:49.110 --> 10:51.830
Do I call Uncle Charlie's new wife Betsy or Aunt Betsy?

10:51.860 --> 10:53.850
I guess either one's okay.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.330
I'm gonna go with Aunt Betsy.

10:55.370 --> 10:56.290
Fine.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.680
Aunt Betsy made a lot of noise last night.

11:01.260 --> 11:02.870
Uh, yeah, yeah, she did.

11:02.900 --> 11:04.450
Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining.

11:06.610 --> 11:08.500
Good morning, family.

11:08.500 --> 11:09.690
Morning.

11:09.720 --> 11:10.650
How we doing today?

11:10.680 --> 11:12.090
Good. Good.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.010
Will Aunt Betsy be joining us

11:14.040 --> 11:16.090
or is she taking a hot, soapy shower?

11:17.040 --> 11:19.020
She'll be right down.

11:19.900 --> 11:22.680
So, based on this latest turn of events,

11:22.710 --> 11:25.600
would it be fair to say you're over Chelsea?

11:26.850 --> 11:28.850
Oh, absolutely.

11:28.880 --> 11:30.860
Betsy and I are soul mates.

11:30.900 --> 11:32.800
Soul mates. Uh-huh.

11:32.830 --> 11:34.530
So, where'd you meet your soul mate?

11:34.560 --> 11:35.450
Guess.

11:35.480 --> 11:37.000
Strip club?

11:37.030 --> 11:38.200
Wrong.

11:39.530 --> 11:41.240
Massage parlor?

11:41.280 --> 11:42.090
Wrong.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.450
Okay, I give up.

11:45.480 --> 11:48.090
Betsy and I met in church.

11:48.130 --> 11:49.990
So what, she's a nun?

11:50.020 --> 11:52.840
No, she's a stripper and part-time masseuse.

11:53.640 --> 11:56.350
See, I drove to the strip club, but the parking lot was full

11:56.390 --> 11:58.930
so I circled the block looking for a spot

11:58.970 --> 12:02.170
and found one right in front of this little church.

12:02.210 --> 12:04.010
And for some reason- I don't know why-

12:04.050 --> 12:05.280
I got out of my car,

12:05.310 --> 12:07.320
walked into the church and started praying.

12:07.350 --> 12:09.360
Are you saying God sent you Betsy?

12:09.400 --> 12:11.400
I think he did. Oh, Dad,

12:11.440 --> 12:13.090
we gotta get our asses to church.

12:14.390 --> 12:16.840
Then when I'm done, I get up to leave

12:16.880 --> 12:18.920
and she appears in front of me

12:18.950 --> 12:21.660
like some kind of vanilla-scented angel.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.570
Mmm, vanilla.

12:23.610 --> 12:25.220
So, we got to talking.

12:25.220 --> 12:27.710
Turns out she's going through a difficult time as well.

12:27.740 --> 12:28.690
Next thing I know,

12:28.720 --> 12:30.510
we're cleaning out her locker at the strip club

12:30.550 --> 12:32.280
and driving to Vegas.

12:32.310 --> 12:33.680
Where you got married.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.930
I understand your skepticism,

12:35.960 --> 12:38.210
but I'm telling you this girl is special.

12:38.250 --> 12:40.710
She's really sweet and spiritual.

12:40.740 --> 12:41.860
BETSY: Charlie?

12:41.900 --> 12:43.170
In here, baby.

12:43.900 --> 12:45.240
Good news, bad news.

12:45.280 --> 12:47.250
I got my period.

12:47.290 --> 12:48.530
Oh, that's okay.

12:48.570 --> 12:49.440
We can take a break.

12:49.470 --> 12:50.770
We don't have to.

12:50.800 --> 12:54.010
There's more than one way to skin a cat.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.540
Oh, you are so wonderful.

12:56.580 --> 12:58.400
What are the other ways?

12:58.440 --> 12:59.770
Shh! Uh...

12:59.800 --> 13:02.480
Charlie, uh, can I talk to you in private for a minute?

13:02.520 --> 13:03.270
Sure.

13:03.310 --> 13:04.990
Bets, coffee's right there.

13:05.030 --> 13:06.260
You just make yourself at home.

13:06.300 --> 13:06.970
Okay.

13:07.370 --> 13:08.390
Morning, son.

13:08.420 --> 13:10.210
Morning, Mom.

13:10.840 --> 13:13.110
So, I was gonna do a little topless sunbathing later.

13:13.150 --> 13:14.310
You're welcome to join me.

13:17.040 --> 13:19.290
Okay, not to put too fine a point on it,

13:19.330 --> 13:21.440
but you're out of your mind.

13:22.140 --> 13:23.340
You need to call a lawyer

13:23.370 --> 13:25.290
and get this marriage annulled immediately.

13:25.330 --> 13:27.370
I knew you wouldn't understand.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.150
Oh, I understand, I understand.

13:29.190 --> 13:30.890
You're still reeling from losing Chelsea

13:30.930 --> 13:32.090
and you're trying to fill the void

13:32.120 --> 13:33.960
with a menstruating pole dancer.

13:33.990 --> 13:36.850
Hey, hey, hey, that's my wife you're talking about.

13:36.880 --> 13:38.970
Oh, damn it, Charlie, you don't know anything about her.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.280
I know I love her and she loves me for exactly who I am.

13:42.320 --> 13:43.670
She doesn't want to change me.

13:43.700 --> 13:44.640
Oh, stop it.

13:47.100 --> 13:50.010
<i>Okay, you get one of those.</i>

13:50.050 --> 13:53.190
Next time, that hand comes back a bloody stump.

13:53.560 --> 13:55.230
Charlie, please, I'm begging you.

13:55.260 --> 13:57.440
No, I'm doing the right thing.

13:58.320 --> 14:01.100
You're lucky you're not a girl.

14:01.140 --> 14:04.120
Having a hoochie is like owning a vintage car.

14:04.160 --> 14:05.820
A lot of maintenance and once a month

14:05.820 --> 14:07.810
you gotta put down an oil pan.

14:12.060 --> 14:14.450
Okay, I may have made a mistake.

14:20.850 --> 14:22.570
Chelsea?

14:24.760 --> 14:26.740
Hey, Charlie. What are you doing here?

14:26.770 --> 14:28.010
I need to see your daughter.

14:28.040 --> 14:29.630
I'm sorry, she's not here.

14:29.670 --> 14:32.630
Hi, Charlie, what's going on? Ed.

14:32.660 --> 14:34.620
You know when she'll be back?

14:34.660 --> 14:35.810
I'm not sure.

14:35.850 --> 14:37.670
She just took Skipper for a walk.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.150
You're welcome to come in and wait.

14:39.180 --> 14:40.320
Thank you.

14:42.750 --> 14:44.410
What are you doing?

14:44.440 --> 14:46.080
I'm just trying to be polite.

14:46.110 --> 14:49.140
Did you ever consider that maybe she doesn't want to see him?

14:49.170 --> 14:50.720
Watch your tone, mister.

14:52.830 --> 14:54.460
Sit, please.

14:55.980 --> 14:58.940
Sorry the place is a mess, we're still decorating.

14:58.970 --> 15:01.060
I'm decorating, he's critiquing.

15:01.090 --> 15:03.960
What, I can have opinions.

15:03.960 --> 15:07.420
He wants me just to shup up and be pretty.

15:09.480 --> 15:10.410
So, listen,

15:10.440 --> 15:12.800
I'm sorry things didn't pan out with you and Chels.

15:12.830 --> 15:14.210
Me, too.

15:14.250 --> 15:16.640
Relationships can be a lot of work.

15:16.680 --> 15:19.700
Even if you've known someone for 40 years.

15:19.730 --> 15:20.690
That's right.

15:20.720 --> 15:23.250
People get set in their pigheaded ways.

15:24.700 --> 15:26.930
You want to get something off your chest, hmm,

15:26.970 --> 15:28.660
I'm right here.

15:29.340 --> 15:32.050
You really want to open this kettle of fish now?

15:32.080 --> 15:33.920
Oh, yeah, let's open it up, open it up.

15:33.950 --> 15:35.390
Okay.

15:35.910 --> 15:39.180
I'm just saying that two grown men should be able to pick out

15:39.210 --> 15:42.870
a club chair without it turning into Iwo freakin' Jima!

15:42.900 --> 15:45.120
Well, I'm not the one that thinks that everything

15:45.160 --> 15:48.640
he sits his ass on has to be made out of leather.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.240
Lucky for you!

15:52.690 --> 15:54.030
CHELSEA: Come on, Skipper.

15:55.440 --> 15:58.440
Charlie? I'm sorry to drop in like this.

15:58.470 --> 15:59.970
I just really needed to see you.

16:00.010 --> 16:01.970
Okay, what's going on?

16:02.000 --> 16:03.980
Uh, well...

16:04.010 --> 16:05.490
Uh, why don't we go in the other room

16:05.530 --> 16:07.820
and leave these two alone? Fine, fine.

16:07.850 --> 16:10.710
There's no law that says we can't order the area rug later

16:10.740 --> 16:12.470
and get two club chairs.

16:12.500 --> 16:13.600
You see, right there.

16:13.630 --> 16:15.390
That's why I love you.

16:18.040 --> 16:19.450
What are you doing here?

16:20.070 --> 16:21.760
Okay, well,

16:21.760 --> 16:24.150
I don't know how to say this,

16:24.190 --> 16:26.780
except just to say it.

16:27.230 --> 16:30.290
I still love you very much, and I miss you like crazy.

16:30.330 --> 16:31.820
I miss you too, Charlie.

16:31.860 --> 16:33.440
Then what are we doing?

16:33.480 --> 16:35.030
Taking some time to figure out

16:35.060 --> 16:36.510
if we're meant to be together.

16:36.550 --> 16:38.100
And how the hell are we supposed to do that?

16:38.370 --> 16:39.320
I don't know.

16:39.360 --> 16:41.720
I guess we should start dating other people.

16:42.650 --> 16:44.300
What?!

16:45.100 --> 16:48.350
I'm not ready to see other people.

16:49.350 --> 16:52.680
I don't know that I am either, but I think we have to try.

16:52.710 --> 16:56.050
Chelsea, I can't even think about dating right now.

16:56.890 --> 16:57.740
Can I tell you something

16:57.780 --> 16:59.680
I've learned about myself since we split up?

16:59.720 --> 17:02.510
Sure, but first, marry me. No.

17:02.540 --> 17:03.700
Okay, just checking.

17:03.740 --> 17:06.060
Probably some legal complications, anyway.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.190
What? Nothing, nothing.

17:08.220 --> 17:08.960
Go ahead.

17:08.990 --> 17:11.589
I've learned that I shouldn't have tried to change you.

17:11.619 --> 17:13.750
What you need is someone who loves you for you.

17:13.780 --> 17:17.030
No, no, no, no, no, no. I need to be changed.

17:17.069 --> 17:19.290
There's something seriously wrong with me.

17:19.319 --> 17:22.319
Please, Chelsea, take me back and turn me into someone else.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.500
That wasn't a very good argument, was it?

17:26.540 --> 17:27.310
Nope.

17:27.990 --> 17:31.330
Well, that's the best I got.

17:32.960 --> 17:36.610
Okay, I guess I should get going.

17:38.410 --> 17:40.070
I'm really sorry.

17:40.510 --> 17:41.960
That's all right.

17:41.960 --> 17:44.270
Say goodbye to your dad for me.

17:44.690 --> 17:46.130
I will.

17:46.170 --> 17:48.220
They're a really cute couple.

17:48.250 --> 17:49.530
I guess.

17:49.570 --> 17:51.290
It's a little weird for me.

17:51.330 --> 17:54.070
Well sure, you're probably used to seeing your dad

17:54.100 --> 17:56.880
with your mom and not a big, handsome black guy.

17:57.720 --> 18:00.100
He is handsome.

18:06.300 --> 18:07.880
Hey, Chels...

18:08.580 --> 18:12.100
I just want you to know that if by chance you should

18:12.140 --> 18:14.840
do something crazy and stupid

18:14.870 --> 18:18.200
like running off and marrying some stranger,

18:19.480 --> 18:23.060
I would forgive you and take you back with open arms.

18:23.090 --> 18:23.920
Good to know.

18:23.950 --> 18:26.300
Seriously, I wouldn't hold it against you at all.

18:27.910 --> 18:29.310
Thank you.

18:30.190 --> 18:31.520
All right then.

18:33.460 --> 18:34.390
Good-bye.

18:34.430 --> 18:35.770
Bye.

18:42.970 --> 18:44.320
TOM (giggling): Stop it, Ed!

18:44.360 --> 18:46.440
Your beard tickles!

18:47.520 --> 18:50.370
Come on, Skipper, time for another walk.

19:01.560 --> 19:03.640
Uh, Charlie, we've got a little problem.

19:03.670 --> 19:04.550
What's up?

19:04.560 --> 19:06.330
This is Besty's husband.

19:06.370 --> 19:08.300
Hello.

19:09.100 --> 19:10.780
Want to catch me up?

19:10.820 --> 19:11.640
Really?

19:11.670 --> 19:14.070
Calling him Betsy's husband didn't do the trick?

19:14.550 --> 19:15.810
I don't understand.

19:15.850 --> 19:17.440
She never said anything about being married.

19:17.470 --> 19:19.340
She never does.

19:19.380 --> 19:20.780
This has happened before?

19:20.820 --> 19:22.510
Oh, yes. Any time I find her wedding ring

19:22.550 --> 19:23.740
inside her empty diaphragm case,

19:23.780 --> 19:26.490
I know she's off on one of her little adventures.

19:27.580 --> 19:29.270
I don't believe this.

19:29.310 --> 19:30.540
Why do you put up with it?

19:30.570 --> 19:31.500
Hey, look at me.

19:31.530 --> 19:33.050
I'd rather share a girl like Betsy

19:33.080 --> 19:34.390
than have an exclusive relationship

19:34.420 --> 19:36.980
with a box of old porn magazines.

19:37.020 --> 19:38.320
I hear you.

19:38.360 --> 19:39.880
That would be sad.

19:40.550 --> 19:41.650
BETSY: Hey, baby.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.090
Hey. Hey.

19:43.790 --> 19:46.440
Charlie, I'm really sorry.

19:46.470 --> 19:49.310
I was less than honest with you.

19:49.640 --> 19:53.890
Sure, let's call it less than honest.

19:54.800 --> 19:57.080
I did enjoy our honeymoon.

19:57.110 --> 19:58.970
Me, too.

19:59.010 --> 20:00.850
We stayed at Bellagio.

20:00.880 --> 20:02.890
Nice!

20:04.330 --> 20:06.010
We should go.

20:08.720 --> 20:11.390
Bye. Bye.

20:12.690 --> 20:15.920
I'll make it up to you in the car.

20:15.960 --> 20:19.260
Oh, Betsy, I'm the luckiest guy in the world.

20:22.950 --> 20:24.610
How about that?

20:25.350 --> 20:27.500
I guess I'm not married.

20:27.540 --> 20:29.190
I guess not.

20:29.800 --> 20:31.730
You know what that means.

20:31.770 --> 20:33.740
Going back to church?

20:37.520 --> 20:41.320
That means I just got three days of unbelievable sex

20:41.360 --> 20:43.790
with no obligations and no commitment.

20:44.440 --> 20:46.940
Please don't make me slap you again.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.360
Nah, go ahead.

20:49.390 --> 20:51.720
I think I got one more coming.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.120
That's all right.

20:53.160 --> 20:55.060
I'm happy that things worked out for you.

20:55.430 --> 20:56.560
Again.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.110
Thanks.

20:58.580 --> 21:02.280
Oh, hey, did I tell you I won 18 grand in Vegas?

21:03.860 --> 21:06.600
(loud smacking) CHARLIE: Ouch!
