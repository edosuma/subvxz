WEBVTT

00:03.420 --> 00:05.671
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:06.214 --> 00:07.840
- Where's Mon?
- She's at home...

00:08.007 --> 00:10.843
...putting up decorations
for Rachel's birthday party tonight.

00:11.052 --> 00:13.220
- And you're not helping?
- I tried...

00:13.388 --> 00:17.307
...but apparently singing "I Will Survive"
in a helium voice, not helping.

00:19.728 --> 00:21.770
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey.

00:22.188 --> 00:24.231
Happy birth...

00:24.399 --> 00:27.067
Shh. Don't say that loud.
Gunther's gonna want to hug me.

00:29.738 --> 00:31.947
Uh, good news, everyone.
We finally found a nanny.

00:32.115 --> 00:37.119
- This is Molly. Molly, Chandler, Joey.
- Hi.

00:37.287 --> 00:39.747
Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy.

00:39.956 --> 00:43.375
You're damn right I am. I've been
waiting for a cookie for seven minutes.

00:44.586 --> 00:46.920
Okay. You know what,
I'm just gonna take her outside.

00:47.088 --> 00:49.423
- No, you stay. I'll do it.
- Okay. Thank you.

00:49.591 --> 00:53.010
- Nice to meet you guys.
- Yeah, you too.

00:53.178 --> 00:55.846
- Wow, Molly's just great.
- Yeah.

00:56.056 --> 00:59.058
Yes, bravo on the hot nanny.

00:59.517 --> 01:02.561
- What? You really think she's hot?
- Are you kidding?

01:02.729 --> 01:06.065
If I wasn't married,
she'd be rejecting me right now.

01:08.318 --> 01:09.443
Joey?

01:09.694 --> 01:11.487
How do you think she's doing?

01:13.656 --> 01:16.116
Am I the only one that doesn't think
she's hot? Ross?

01:16.326 --> 01:20.913
- Ah, I mean, she's not unattractive, but...
- Right.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.499
...but hot? Ah...

01:23.917 --> 01:25.751
Thank you. Ha, ha.

01:28.004 --> 01:29.296
Now that Rachel's gone?

01:29.506 --> 01:32.049
So hot,
I cried myself to sleep last night.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.105
Hey, Mike, what's the capital of Peru?

02:28.273 --> 02:30.899
- Lima.
- No.

02:32.902 --> 02:35.863
It starts with a V and ends with an X.

02:36.030 --> 02:39.908
And hopefully with a T-O
in the middle.

02:40.451 --> 02:43.787
You know, come to think of it,
the capital of Peru is "Vtox."

02:46.166 --> 02:47.499
- Oh, God!
- What?

02:47.667 --> 02:49.960
Okay. I don't want to freak you out
or anything...

02:50.128 --> 02:52.004
...but I just saw a rat in your cupboard.

02:52.213 --> 02:54.673
Oh, yeah. No, that's Bob.

02:56.509 --> 02:58.343
Well, he's your pet rat?

02:58.553 --> 03:01.180
Well, not so much a pet as,
you know, an occasional visitor...

03:01.347 --> 03:06.810
...who I put food out for.
You know, kind of like Santa.

03:07.562 --> 03:11.273
Except Santa doesn't poop
on the plate of cookies.

03:11.608 --> 03:14.526
You can't keep a rat in your apartment.
They're extremely unsanitary.

03:14.694 --> 03:17.696
I mean, they transmit leptospirosis
and hantavirus.

03:17.906 --> 03:19.448
- What are those?
- I don't know...

03:19.616 --> 03:22.075
...but they don't sound
like spa treatments.

03:22.243 --> 03:24.786
- You have to get rid of it.
- Okay, fine.

03:24.954 --> 03:27.247
If it means that much to you,
I'll get rid of Bob.

03:27.457 --> 03:29.124
Thank you.

03:29.292 --> 03:33.045
It's so weird you think he's so gross,
yet you're willing to eat his crackers.

03:40.595 --> 03:42.471
- Hello.
- Hello.

03:42.639 --> 03:45.349
Gavin, I just want to say
thank you again...

03:45.558 --> 03:48.560
...for watching Emma yesterday
during the presentation.

03:48.728 --> 03:50.604
I really owe you an apology.

03:50.897 --> 03:53.649
- For what?
- When we first met, you know...

03:53.816 --> 03:57.319
...I thought you were pompous
and arrogant and obnoxious.

03:57.570 --> 04:00.197
Is this your first apology?

04:00.365 --> 04:03.617
No, I just mean, you know,
first impressions don't mean anything.

04:03.785 --> 04:08.705
And I think you're a really good guy.
And I'm sorry that I misjudged you.

04:08.873 --> 04:11.250
- Morning.
- Hello.

04:11.417 --> 04:14.586
But you know what?
Hey, new day, new leaf.

04:14.754 --> 04:18.423
I am just really, really happy...

04:19.676 --> 04:22.719
I'm sorry. Obviously, Heather's ass
has something more important to say...

04:22.887 --> 04:25.681
...so I'll just wait till it's finished.

04:26.140 --> 04:28.100
- What?
- I was giving you an apology...

04:28.268 --> 04:30.269
...and you were totally checking her out.

04:30.478 --> 04:34.439
I wasn't checking her out. I'm in fashion.
I was looking at her skirt.

04:34.607 --> 04:39.236
Or was it pants? I didn't really see
what happened below the ass area.

04:40.154 --> 04:42.698
Wow, you are really...
You're really a creep.

04:42.865 --> 04:44.992
What do you even care
if I was looking at her?

04:45.159 --> 04:46.493
Are you jealous?

04:46.703 --> 04:48.370
Oh, yeah. I'm jealous.

04:48.538 --> 04:51.873
"Oh, Gavin. Please,
please look at my ass."

04:53.167 --> 04:55.669
Stop looking at my ass.

04:55.837 --> 04:58.588
I mean, I just think
you are totally inappropriate. Okay?

04:58.756 --> 05:02.134
This is a work environment.
She's your subordinate.

05:02.343 --> 05:05.846
But it was okay when you
slept with your old assistant, Tag?

05:06.014 --> 05:09.266
That is totally different for two reasons.

05:09.434 --> 05:12.894
One, I didn't know that you knew that.

05:14.188 --> 05:17.816
And two, I wasn't some creep
staring at his ass.

05:17.984 --> 05:22.446
We had a... We had a deep,
meaningful relationship.

05:23.197 --> 05:25.949
Huh. What was Tag's last name?

05:26.159 --> 05:27.868
It was...

05:29.662 --> 05:31.538
Oh, my God.

05:31.706 --> 05:35.250
He didn't have a last name.

05:35.418 --> 05:41.089
It was just Tag, you know,
like Cher or...

05:41.466 --> 05:43.925
...you know, Moses.

05:45.386 --> 05:47.804
But it was a deep,
meaningful relationship.

05:48.014 --> 05:51.016
You know what? My first impression
of you was absolutely right.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.977
You are arrogant. You are pompous.
Morgan! Morgan!

05:54.145 --> 05:56.938
- Tag's last name was Morgan! Ha!
- It was Jones.

05:57.148 --> 05:59.775
What are you, his boyfriend?

06:03.863 --> 06:07.783
- Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.
- You mean when you were a baby?

06:08.368 --> 06:09.951
Sure.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.414
Would you stop staring at her?

06:15.333 --> 06:17.125
I wasn't staring.

06:17.293 --> 06:19.711
I was leering.

06:20.254 --> 06:22.130
What's the big deal with her?

06:22.298 --> 06:25.384
Maybe she's attractive
in an obvious kind of way.

06:25.593 --> 06:28.887
Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.681
You know, when it's right there
in your face.

06:31.849 --> 06:34.643
Me, I like to have to work
to find someone attractive.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.645
Makes me feel like I earned it.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.940
Looks like Joey's doing all right
with her.

06:40.358 --> 06:42.567
Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys
to back off...

06:42.735 --> 06:45.862
...and let Joey get the girl for once.

06:47.156 --> 06:50.826
- I'm gonna take her to the apartment.
- Okay, I'll be home right after work.

06:50.993 --> 06:53.412
- Okay.
- Okay, bye, Emma-wemma-demma.

06:53.579 --> 06:57.040
I lovey-wovey-dove you.

06:57.208 --> 06:58.542
- Bye.
- Bye.

06:58.709 --> 07:01.169
They've elected me to talk to you
about the baby talk.

07:01.337 --> 07:03.713
It's not so good.

07:03.965 --> 07:06.133
I think it's sweet.

07:06.342 --> 07:08.468
Bye, Emma-wemma!

07:10.304 --> 07:15.308
Hey, listen, Joey. About Molly, I would
really prefer if you didn't go after her.

07:15.518 --> 07:16.560
Why not?

07:16.727 --> 07:18.562
Because it took months
to find a good nanny.

07:18.729 --> 07:22.566
And I wouldn't want anything to,
you know, drive her away.

07:22.775 --> 07:24.818
So you think I'm just
gonna sleep with her...

07:24.986 --> 07:28.280
...and never call her again, and
things are gonna get uncomfortable?

07:28.448 --> 07:30.574
Yeah, that sounds about right.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.785
Come on, there are plenty
of other women out there, okay?

07:33.953 --> 07:38.915
Just forget about her, okay?
She's off-limits.

07:39.125 --> 07:42.252
Oh, man. What'd you have to go
and say that for?

07:42.420 --> 07:46.131
Now that you told me I can't have her,
makes me want her even more!

07:46.924 --> 07:49.551
- What are you, a child?
- Yes.

07:49.760 --> 07:52.179
Look, Joey, come on now.
For me, please.

07:52.346 --> 07:57.267
Just try to focus your sexual energy
on someone else.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.394
Fine.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.361
Take me home.

08:13.618 --> 08:16.036
- Hey, Mikey.
- Hey, Pheeb.

08:16.245 --> 08:18.663
- What are you doing?
- Setting rattraps.

08:18.873 --> 08:23.460
- To kill Bob?
- No. No, to test his neck strength.

08:23.669 --> 08:26.922
But no, I don't want to kill him.
I thought we were gonna capture him...

08:27.089 --> 08:29.716
...and, you know,
set him free in the countryside...

08:29.884 --> 08:31.801
...where he could meet
a friendly possum...

08:31.969 --> 08:34.888
...and a wisecracking owl.

08:35.181 --> 08:38.933
- Okay, okay. I'll throw away the traps.
- All right, I'll find Bob. I'll get him.

08:39.101 --> 08:43.230
Bob? Bob?

08:43.397 --> 08:45.815
Robert?

08:47.485 --> 08:49.194
Wait, I think I hear him.

08:50.988 --> 08:56.117
Oh, my God! Bob had babies!
Bob's a mom!

08:56.285 --> 08:57.869
We'll have to think of a new name.

08:58.037 --> 09:00.497
Oh, I don't know,
I kind of like "Bob" for a girl.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.415
No, no. I mean, I'm not sure that we...

09:05.586 --> 09:09.506
Oh, my God. We killed Bob?

09:09.674 --> 09:12.342
Well, maybe it wasn't Bob.
Maybe it was a mouse.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.886
Susie?

09:19.141 --> 09:21.142
What's up?

09:22.353 --> 09:24.479
Seriously, dude. Three years ago.

09:26.315 --> 09:29.276
Listen, can you do me a favor?
I'm gonna be out today.

09:29.485 --> 09:30.860
Can you keep an eye on Joey...

09:31.028 --> 09:33.613
...make sure nothing happens
between him and Molly?

09:33.823 --> 09:35.949
- You don't trust him?
- Well, no.

09:36.158 --> 09:38.868
Some woman who sounded
a lot like Joey called earlier...

09:39.036 --> 09:42.914
...and asked for her daughter,
uh, the "hot nanny."

09:43.666 --> 09:46.376
Is this really your long-term plan,
for me to run interference?

09:46.544 --> 09:50.213
Because I could get a job any day now.

09:50.381 --> 09:53.967
You do appear right on the cusp
of something.

09:54.135 --> 09:57.345
Look, come on, man. I'm sure
he'll lose interest in a week or two...

09:57.555 --> 10:00.015
...but for now, could you please
just do this for me?

10:00.224 --> 10:02.100
Fine, but don't blame me
if it doesn't work.

10:02.268 --> 10:04.894
Because you know once Joey
sets his mind on something...

10:05.062 --> 10:08.523
...more often than not,
he's going to have sex with it.

10:09.942 --> 10:12.652
Well, I mean,
we've gotta do something. Okay?

10:12.820 --> 10:16.323
Nannies like her don't grow on trees.

10:18.993 --> 10:21.202
- Picturing that tree?
- I am, yes.

10:28.794 --> 10:31.046
Where you going, Joe?

10:35.426 --> 10:37.135
For a walk.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.304
Oh, you mind if I join you?

10:39.555 --> 10:44.851
Actually, uh, I'd rather be alone. You know,
I really need to organize my thoughts.

10:46.103 --> 10:48.355
Your thoughts?

10:48.648 --> 10:50.357
Plural?

10:51.567 --> 10:55.070
All right, fine. I only have one thought.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.906
It's about the hot nanny. I gotta see her.

10:58.908 --> 11:02.452
- I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
- Now you're telling me I can't see her?

11:02.620 --> 11:07.123
You guys are killing me.
She's forbidden fruit. It's like, like...

11:07.291 --> 11:11.086
Like she's the princess
and I'm the stable boy.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.673
Why are you doing this, huh?

11:14.840 --> 11:17.092
Did Ross tell you not to let me
go over there?

11:17.301 --> 11:20.011
Yes, as a matter of fact, he did.
So I can't let you go.

11:20.221 --> 11:24.057
Huh. Interesting.
Now there are obstacles.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.728
Hot nanny and me against the world.

11:28.896 --> 11:31.022
This is the stuff great novels
are made of.

11:31.232 --> 11:33.817
- Great novels?
- Fine. Mediocre porn.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.824
- Gavin Mitchell's office.
- Rachel Green's office.

11:40.991 --> 11:42.534
Give me that phone.

11:43.994 --> 11:47.414
Hello, this is Rachel Green.
How can I help you?

11:47.581 --> 11:52.752
Uh-huh. Okay, then.
I'll pass you back to your son.

11:53.921 --> 11:56.756
Hey, Mom. No, that's just my secretary.

11:59.719 --> 12:02.846
Um, excuse me, Gavin.
I have a question I need to ask you.

12:03.013 --> 12:06.057
Mom, I'll call you later. Yeah.

12:06.350 --> 12:09.728
- Yes?
- If you like looking at butts so much...

12:09.895 --> 12:13.356
...why don't you just go
look in a mirror?

12:14.233 --> 12:15.650
Thank God you finally said that.

12:15.818 --> 12:19.112
I saw you make a note on your pad
three hours ago.

12:22.158 --> 12:24.534
- Man, I really bug you. Don't I?
- Oh, no. Please...

12:24.702 --> 12:26.536
...I don't care about you
enough to bug me.

12:26.704 --> 12:30.206
In fact, from now on,
I'm going to take the high road...

12:30.374 --> 12:33.877
...and I'm going to be very, very nice
to you, you mama's boy...

12:34.044 --> 12:35.378
...starting right now.

12:37.673 --> 12:39.090
- Hey, Rach.
- Hi.

12:39.258 --> 12:41.092
- Ready for your birthday lunch?
- I am.

12:41.260 --> 12:44.345
But first, Monica,
I would like to introduce you...

12:44.513 --> 12:47.682
...to my very talented colleague
and more importantly...

12:47.850 --> 12:50.685
...my wonderful friend, Gavin Mitchell.

12:50.895 --> 12:52.687
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.

12:52.855 --> 12:54.397
Are you coming to Rachel's party?

12:54.607 --> 12:57.984
Oh, no, no, no. Gavin can't.
He already has plans...

12:58.152 --> 13:00.612
...most likely with his mother.

13:01.238 --> 13:05.533
I don't mind. I'll cancel them. I would
never miss my secretary's birthday.

13:07.620 --> 13:11.790
Why did you invite him?
I can't stand that guy.

13:11.999 --> 13:14.459
- You were being so nice to him.
- I was faking it.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.461
Can't you tell when I'm being fake?

13:17.713 --> 13:20.089
Hey, Mr. Phillips. Nice suit.

13:20.257 --> 13:23.218
- Right there. That was so fake!
- Shh!

13:32.520 --> 13:34.562
Oh, hi.

13:34.730 --> 13:36.773
I still can't believe you invited Gavin.

13:36.941 --> 13:39.734
I mean, he is just the last person
I want to see.

13:39.985 --> 13:43.530
You're welcome for the party.
I'm glad you're having a good time.

13:43.697 --> 13:47.408
God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course
he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me.

13:47.576 --> 13:49.619
- Does he?
- What?

13:50.079 --> 13:53.122
Maybe he keeps bothering you
so much because he likes you.

13:53.290 --> 13:56.000
It's like in first grade
when Skippy Lange would push me...

13:56.168 --> 13:58.628
...because he secretly
had a crush on me.

13:58.796 --> 14:02.048
Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you?

14:02.216 --> 14:05.510
Honey, all those boys had a bet
to see if he could knock you over.

14:07.555 --> 14:10.640
- She's out. I'm gonna take her home.
- Oh, okay. Thank you.

14:10.808 --> 14:12.851
Bye, sweetheart.

14:16.021 --> 14:18.565
Do you see what all the guys see in her?

14:18.732 --> 14:21.276
Wouldn't kick her out of bed.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.236
No more vodka for me.

14:25.114 --> 14:27.574
Hey, Rach. So can I sing
"Happy Birthday" to you now?

14:27.741 --> 14:30.159
- Yeah, sure.
- Oh. All right.

14:30.327 --> 14:31.494
Happy birth...

14:32.955 --> 14:35.039
See you later.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.792
Hey, Rach. Somebody got you shoes.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.168
Give me.

14:40.296 --> 14:45.758
- Wow. Wow. Oh, my God!
- Careful! Careful!

14:45.968 --> 14:48.303
These are my rat babies!

14:51.056 --> 14:54.475
Yeah. We have rat babies now.

14:56.020 --> 14:59.689
Oh, you brought rats
to my birthday party?

14:59.899 --> 15:02.817
So this is what a stroke feels like.

15:03.027 --> 15:05.361
Well, I had to bring them.
We killed their mother.

15:05.529 --> 15:07.780
They're our responsibility now.

15:07.948 --> 15:09.908
You know, they require constant care.

15:10.075 --> 15:11.910
You should know that, Rachel,
you're a mother.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.623
Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?

15:16.832 --> 15:18.791
No. Seven rats.

15:20.377 --> 15:22.670
I think we should take them home.
We need to feed them.

15:22.838 --> 15:25.632
Wait, you're gonna leave my party
to take care of a box of rats?

15:25.841 --> 15:28.217
Well, I'm sorry, Rachel,
but I'm not like you. Okay?

15:28.385 --> 15:31.054
Not everyone can afford help.

15:38.479 --> 15:40.396
Hey, where the hell are Joey and Molly?

15:40.564 --> 15:42.065
I asked you to watch them.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.776
I'm sorry. I got a little preoccupied.

15:45.903 --> 15:48.947
Look, we have to stop them
before something happens.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.950
Right behind you, big guy.

15:53.744 --> 15:56.037
So you see, Molly,
what people don't understand...

15:56.246 --> 15:59.916
...is that acting is a discipline.
It takes a lot of hard work.

16:00.125 --> 16:03.002
- So where'd you study?
- Oh, I didn't go to college.

16:03.212 --> 16:09.092
- No, where'd you study acting?
- Molly, people don't study acting.

16:11.971 --> 16:15.765
Molly, uh, do you mind giving us
just a minute?

16:15.975 --> 16:18.226
- Sure. I'll go check on Emma.
- Thanks.

16:20.187 --> 16:23.231
Will the stable boy
never get the princess?

16:23.565 --> 16:27.735
What do you think you were gonna do,
have sex with her here on my couch?

16:27.945 --> 16:31.155
No. The leather sticks to my ass.

16:32.491 --> 16:35.535
This isn't fair. What makes you think
I'm gonna sleep with her...

16:35.703 --> 16:37.286
...and then blow her off, huh?

16:37.454 --> 16:41.708
Can't you guys open your minds to
the possibility that I actually like her...

16:41.875 --> 16:43.876
...and might want something real?

16:45.462 --> 16:50.466
Look, the truth is I haven't felt
this way about anyone since Rachel.

16:50.634 --> 16:53.970
Okay?
I didn't think I could ever love again.

16:54.930 --> 16:56.431
- Come on.
- Joe.

17:02.771 --> 17:04.646
Hi. Is Molly here?

17:04.815 --> 17:07.025
Uh, yeah, yeah. Come on in. Molly?

17:07.526 --> 17:12.739
- Hey. Guys, this is Tabitha.
- Hey.

17:14.282 --> 17:16.992
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

17:26.170 --> 17:31.340
Uh, well, Joey, I guess
we have no problem.

17:32.426 --> 17:36.304
It's like my favorite fairy tale come true.

17:37.639 --> 17:41.017
The princess, the stable boy
and the lesbian.

17:44.480 --> 17:46.773
Okay. Okay,
you start preparing the formula...

17:46.940 --> 17:48.649
...and I'll start changing the box.

17:48.817 --> 17:51.944
And then we gotta put them
straight to bed.

17:52.154 --> 17:54.030
When did we become
one of those couples...

17:54.198 --> 17:56.699
...whose lives revolve around their rats?

17:58.327 --> 18:01.037
Well, you know what?
They're our responsibility now.

18:01.246 --> 18:04.749
Okay, fine.
These rats are our responsibility.

18:04.958 --> 18:07.335
What happens when they mate
and there are hundreds?

18:07.544 --> 18:10.505
Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.

18:10.839 --> 18:13.299
Yeah, uh, not such a problem with rats.

18:13.467 --> 18:16.886
No, they're more of a "love the one
you're with" kind of animal.

18:17.679 --> 18:19.764
No. Really?

18:19.932 --> 18:23.392
Oh, my... Get off your sister! Ew.

18:25.062 --> 18:27.605
Oh, my God. What are we gonna do?

18:27.773 --> 18:30.900
- The... We have seven rats.
- Uh-huh.

18:31.068 --> 18:33.694
So, what if each of them
has seven rats...

18:33.862 --> 18:37.824
...and then each of those
have seven rats? That's like...

18:40.911 --> 18:44.038
That's math I can't even do.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.999
What are we gonna do?

18:47.209 --> 18:49.627
Well, I know this is gonna
sound crazy...

18:49.795 --> 18:56.384
...but we could
not let the box of rats ruin our lives.

18:58.428 --> 19:02.014
Yeah, okay. I guess you're right.

19:02.182 --> 19:05.518
All right, so we should just
give them away.

19:06.145 --> 19:11.649
But to nice families with children
and reduced-fat Wheat Thins.

19:11.817 --> 19:14.193
Those were Bob's favorites.

19:14.361 --> 19:16.279
It's gonna be okay.

19:17.573 --> 19:21.367
- You must think I'm crazy.
- No, I think you're sweet.

19:21.535 --> 19:23.035
Good.

19:23.537 --> 19:24.787
This is just so hard.

19:24.955 --> 19:28.374
It's hard for me to let them go.

19:28.542 --> 19:31.711
I guess it just brings back memories,
you know...

19:32.671 --> 19:37.550
...from when I gave birth to my brother's
triplets and I had to give them up.

19:43.557 --> 19:45.975
I haven't told you about that yet, have I?

19:55.986 --> 19:58.279
- Hey.
- Hi.

19:58.447 --> 20:01.741
Thanks for the party, honey.
Should I help you clean up?

20:01.909 --> 20:06.078
No way. You had your party.
Now I have mine.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.459
- Is everything all right?
- I just get bummed...

20:11.627 --> 20:13.127
...when my birthday's over.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.922
Well, at least you have one thing
to be happy about.

20:16.089 --> 20:18.424
- Mm?
- That jerk, Gavin, from your office...

20:18.592 --> 20:19.967
...didn't show up.
- Ah.

20:20.135 --> 20:22.220
Yeah, I hate him.

20:24.806 --> 20:27.934
We weren't talking about you.
We were...

20:28.101 --> 20:31.729
No. No way to recover. No. Okay.

20:33.649 --> 20:37.109
- Fun party.
- Well, it was.

20:37.277 --> 20:40.071
And you would have seen it
if you didn't show up at...

20:40.239 --> 20:45.743
Nine-thirty? God.
Ugh, this party was lame.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.829
Again, you're welcome.

20:48.997 --> 20:53.709
- Look, I'll just give you this and go.
- Oh, you bought me a present. Why?

20:54.878 --> 20:58.589
Let me explain how birthday parties
usually work. There are presents...

20:58.757 --> 21:01.592
...and a cake,
perhaps a fourth or fifth person.

21:03.971 --> 21:05.888
Okay, I, uh...

21:06.098 --> 21:09.433
I got you the present to make up
for being such a jerk to you.

21:09.601 --> 21:15.189
Aw. Well, okay. Well, that's very nice.
And you wrote a card.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.567
- "From Gavin."
- I really mean it.

21:22.364 --> 21:25.658
Oh. Oh.

21:25.826 --> 21:27.368
Oh, it's beautiful.

21:27.577 --> 21:29.787
- If you don't mind? Let me.
- No.

21:32.082 --> 21:35.334
Well, what do you know, it fits.

21:37.337 --> 21:41.757
See, Gavin. You're capable of being
a nice guy.

21:41.925 --> 21:44.010
Why do you give me such a hard time?

21:45.262 --> 21:46.804
I'm not sure.

21:47.097 --> 21:52.018
Well, Monica seems to think
it's because you have feelings for me.

21:52.227 --> 21:54.312
I do have feelings for you.

21:56.189 --> 21:59.358
- You do?
- Yes. I feel that you're a little annoying.

22:00.819 --> 22:02.153
See, why? Gavin, why?

22:02.404 --> 22:06.449
Right when I'm about to change
my opinion of you, you go and you...

22:10.203 --> 22:12.538
And you do that.

22:30.557 --> 22:35.686
First I was afraid, I was petrified

22:39.816 --> 22:41.150
- Hey.
- Hi.

22:41.318 --> 22:43.110
Listen, um, I think I left something here.

22:43.362 --> 22:46.614
Oh. Uh, well, somebody left this.
Is this yours?

22:46.782 --> 22:48.991
Oh. No, but I like it.

22:50.702 --> 22:53.162
No, I think I left one of my rat babies.

22:53.372 --> 22:57.792
Oh. Uh, well, no. I haven't seen it,
but if I do, I'll let you know.

22:57.959 --> 23:01.253
Aah! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby!
Rat baby!

23:02.839 --> 23:03.881
Maybe that's him.
