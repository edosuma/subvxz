00:01.402 --> 00:03.313
MITCH: A year ago the animals
started acting strangely,

00:03.337 --> 00:04.572
but no one noticed...

00:04.605 --> 00:05.439
(growls)

00:05.473 --> 00:06.740
until they began attacking...

00:06.774 --> 00:08.576
coordinating...

00:08.609 --> 00:09.577
evolving.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.479
The animals were mutating,

00:11.512 --> 00:13.390
and it was happening faster
than anyone expected.

00:13.414 --> 00:15.449
The government came
up with a plan.

00:15.483 --> 00:18.052
PSA NARRATOR: Thanks
to the Noah Objective,

00:18.086 --> 00:19.120
in six to ten years,

00:19.153 --> 00:20.454
the world's animal population

00:20.488 --> 00:22.723
will be thriving once again.

00:22.756 --> 00:25.059
Killing the animals?
Play God and repopulate

00:25.093 --> 00:27.328
the planet? This is ridiculous.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.738
MITCH: But messing
with Mother Nature

00:28.762 --> 00:30.598
could be catastrophic.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.476
So, a group of us are
trying to save the animals.

00:32.500 --> 00:34.802
Jackson Oz and Abraham Kenyatta,

00:34.835 --> 00:36.470
animal experts.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.072
Chloe Tousignant,

00:38.106 --> 00:39.273
an intel operative.

00:39.307 --> 00:41.075
Jamie Campbell,

00:41.109 --> 00:42.510
a reporter who's been

00:42.543 --> 00:43.544
following this story

00:43.577 --> 00:45.079
found me, Mitch Morgan,

00:45.113 --> 00:47.781
a veterinary pathologist.

00:47.815 --> 00:50.384
Together,
we're going to find a cure

00:50.418 --> 00:51.485
for the animals.

00:51.519 --> 00:53.654
Time is running out.

00:54.688 --> 00:56.757
ABRAHAM: Previously on Zoo...

00:56.790 --> 00:58.226
Hey,

00:58.259 --> 00:59.793
what is that? You all right?

00:59.827 --> 01:01.138
Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, it's nothing.

01:01.162 --> 01:02.563
It's a dog bite. It's fine.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.165
You were born O negative,

01:04.197 --> 01:05.666
but it changed recently.

01:05.699 --> 01:07.244
The mutation isn't
contagious, all right?

01:07.268 --> 01:08.569
It can't spread to humans.

01:08.602 --> 01:10.804
Maybe we don't know
as much as we thought.

01:10.838 --> 01:12.240
JACKSON: Whose plane is this?

01:12.273 --> 01:13.741
ELEANOR: An interested
third party.

01:13.774 --> 01:15.243
Do we have an
official assignment?

01:15.276 --> 01:16.477
ELEANOR: Start in Argentina.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.212
Meet with Dr. Vickers.

01:18.246 --> 01:20.181
See if this animal he's
hunting can help you.

01:20.214 --> 01:21.391
DARIELA: The animal
we're tracking did this?

01:21.415 --> 01:23.417
DR. VICKERS: An animal
with a Phase Two mutation

01:23.451 --> 01:24.652
inflicted these wounds.

01:24.685 --> 01:25.729
It's the pivotal link
in the next phase

01:25.753 --> 01:26.720
of the mutation.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.389
(groaning)

01:34.295 --> 01:35.263
You're the team?

01:35.296 --> 01:36.197
We're here to help.

01:36.230 --> 01:37.365
A little late.

01:37.398 --> 01:38.832
It's me, it's Jamie.

01:38.866 --> 01:40.601
I have the leopard;
I have the cure.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.470
Jamie's alive.
ELEANOR: I'm sending choppers

01:42.503 --> 01:43.871
and a team to New Brunswick

01:43.904 --> 01:45.306
to get Ms.
Campbell and the cure.

01:45.339 --> 01:46.474
Jamie!

01:46.507 --> 01:47.475
Let's go!

01:47.508 --> 01:48.609
We can't leave her here!

That killed my entire team.

05:56.557 --> 05:57.858
And Dr. Vickers?

05:57.891 --> 05:58.726
Him, too.

05:58.759 --> 06:01.161
Did Vickers know what
he was looking for?

06:01.194 --> 06:02.996
That the Phase Two
animal was a man?

06:03.030 --> 06:04.732
That look like a man to you?

06:04.765 --> 06:06.767
(choking)

06:06.800 --> 06:07.901
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, hey!

06:07.935 --> 06:08.969
Easy, Lara Croft.

06:09.002 --> 06:09.970
You need to stand back.

06:10.003 --> 06:11.805
This thing killed six rangers.

06:11.839 --> 06:13.407
One of them was my best friend.

06:13.441 --> 06:14.851
His first daughter
just about to be born,

06:14.875 --> 06:16.453
so if you think I'm
gonna show this thing

06:16.477 --> 06:17.545
any kindness at all...

06:17.578 --> 06:19.046
He's dying. Good.

06:19.079 --> 06:20.189
He can't get dead enough for me.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.849
Look,
we're sorry about your team,

06:21.882 --> 06:23.884
but this man,
we haven't seen anything

06:23.917 --> 06:24.952
like him before.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.487
CHLOE: No one has. Lieutenant,

06:26.520 --> 06:28.589
we need to take him back with
us, alive,

06:28.622 --> 06:29.657
so lower your weapon.

06:32.593 --> 06:35.463
We have to get him
back to the plane.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.833
What about my squad?

06:39.867 --> 06:41.478
I'll put in a request
for a recovery team.

06:41.502 --> 06:42.803
Request?

06:42.836 --> 06:43.804
I'll bury them myself.

06:43.837 --> 06:44.938
There's no time for that.

06:44.972 --> 06:46.173
I'm not asking for permission.

06:46.206 --> 06:48.008
I'll stay and help
her bury them.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.878
If that poor man has the
same mutation as the animals,

06:50.911 --> 06:52.713
you have to find out why.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.716
(mutated man gurgles)

06:59.887 --> 07:01.130
CHLOE (whispering): You see that?
JACKSON: Yeah.

07:01.154 --> 07:02.523
The scarring looks like...

07:02.556 --> 07:03.624
Yeah. Looks like my arm.

07:03.657 --> 07:05.826
Yeah, I know.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.833
You two want to
share with the class?

07:12.866 --> 07:15.503
Yeah, we were just, um,

07:15.536 --> 07:17.805
looking at where you patched him
up, unbelievable.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.673
He heals quick.

07:22.676 --> 07:24.678
Okay, fine, keep your secrets.

07:24.712 --> 07:27.080
I'm more concerned about him.

07:28.816 --> 07:32.553
His heart rate is
holding steady at 170.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.688
It's twice what it should be.

07:34.722 --> 07:37.090
Respiration is off the
charts for a human being.

07:37.124 --> 07:40.193
The way he's changing,
the heightened metabolism,

07:40.227 --> 07:41.562
accelerated healing...

07:41.595 --> 07:43.564
We saw that in other animals.

07:43.597 --> 07:47.535
Yeah, mutation made them
better, stronger, right?

07:47.568 --> 07:50.571
Him...

07:50.604 --> 07:52.573
it's like he's...

07:52.606 --> 07:54.708
turning into the
perfect predator.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.196
(birds cawing)

08:38.051 --> 08:40.053
(beetles chittering)

08:53.133 --> 08:55.603
(gasps)

08:57.605 --> 09:00.574
No, no, no, no, no, no.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.785
CHLOE: And do you
have any update

09:11.819 --> 09:14.021
on the compound? Not yet,

09:14.054 --> 09:16.323
but I expect to send a team
to look for Jamie soon.

09:16.356 --> 09:18.058
We're just stretched
so thin right now.

09:18.091 --> 09:19.059
I-I was lucky

09:19.092 --> 09:20.794
to be able to task the rangers

09:20.828 --> 09:21.995
to accompany Dr. Vickers.

09:22.029 --> 09:24.031
Have you located him?

09:24.064 --> 09:27.300
He's dead. The Phase Two animal
he was chasing killed him

09:27.334 --> 09:29.202
and the rangers, too.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.838
Were you able to
secure the animal?

09:32.840 --> 09:35.643
No, there was no sign of
it by the time we arrived.

09:35.676 --> 09:37.678
It took weeks for Vickers
to get this close.

09:37.711 --> 09:38.679
I'd like to keep

09:38.712 --> 09:39.680
the team in Patagonia.

09:39.713 --> 09:40.681
Continue the search.

09:40.714 --> 09:41.749
It's too dangerous

09:41.782 --> 09:42.792
without a military escort.

09:42.816 --> 09:44.818
With all due respect, Eleanor,

09:44.852 --> 09:47.320
just walking out the front
door is a risk these days.

09:47.354 --> 09:49.089
I'll take my chances out here

09:49.122 --> 09:50.223
with the rest of my team.

09:50.257 --> 09:51.224
Fair enough.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.693
Thank you.

09:53.661 --> 09:56.196
Why didn't you tell
Eleanor about the...

09:56.229 --> 09:57.898
man we found out there?

09:57.931 --> 10:00.100
He has a Phase Two mutation.
So could you.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.970
If I tell her the
truth, he disappears

10:03.003 --> 10:05.639
into a government lab,
and we never see him again.

10:05.673 --> 10:07.340
Chloe,
we have to be honest with...

10:07.374 --> 10:10.711
Studying him might be our only
chance to understand this.

10:10.744 --> 10:13.814
There's only one thing that matters now...
finding a cure.

10:13.847 --> 10:15.983
I'm sorry,
but I'm not going to lose you.

10:16.016 --> 10:18.852
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, shh.

10:18.886 --> 10:21.054
We don't know what's
going to happen to me.

10:21.088 --> 10:23.390
Well, you saw the scar
tissue, Jackson.

10:23.423 --> 10:27.127
You said it yourself.
It's just like your arm.

10:27.160 --> 10:30.263
If we can figure out
what happened to him,

10:30.297 --> 10:33.166
then we can stop it
from happening to you.

10:42.275 --> 10:45.979
(raspy panting)

10:46.013 --> 10:50.784
His arm looks like
it was bitten off.

10:50.818 --> 10:52.419
More like it was gnawed.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.723
Whatever happened,
it wasn't fast.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.725
It wasn't clean.
It probably hurt like hell.

10:57.758 --> 10:59.092
(door opens)

11:00.293 --> 11:01.862
Son of a bitch.

11:01.895 --> 11:04.431
Why is this thing still alive?

11:04.464 --> 11:06.266
Okay, so I got a hit
on his fingerprints.

11:06.299 --> 11:09.169
He's a doctor from Hungary
working with the Red Cross.

11:09.202 --> 11:10.904
Janos Kovacs.

11:10.938 --> 11:11.905
Kovacs?

11:11.939 --> 11:13.741
Do you know him?

11:13.774 --> 11:17.177
Yeah. I-I mean, not well,
but we worked the same

11:17.210 --> 11:18.178
refugee camp

11:18.211 --> 11:19.880
in Egypt a few years back.

11:19.913 --> 11:22.149
According to his visa,
he arrived five weeks ago.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.417
Was headed for a
village called Ydermo.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.153
Well,

11:26.186 --> 11:28.355
then that's where we start.
Don't bother.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.958
My team was there two days ago.
Everyone's dead.

11:30.991 --> 11:32.159
Massacred by

11:32.192 --> 11:33.761
this thing Kovacs turned into.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.428
Well, it's our only lead.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.364
You all are insane.

11:37.397 --> 11:38.942
What if there are more
like him out there?

11:38.966 --> 11:40.300
She has a point.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.302
We don't know what
we're walking into.

11:42.335 --> 11:45.172
We should wait until Mitch
has finished his tests,

11:45.205 --> 11:47.374
so we know more about
this new mutation.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.242
MITCH: Why am I not surprised

11:49.276 --> 11:50.911
you want to stay on the plane?

11:50.944 --> 11:52.112
Excuse me?

11:52.145 --> 11:54.447
You heard me.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.850
You know,

11:56.884 --> 11:59.452
sometimes what's out
there is worth the risk.

11:59.486 --> 12:02.255
But if you want to hang
back, take a bubble bath,

12:02.289 --> 12:03.957
that's cool with me.

12:03.991 --> 12:05.325
Just stay out of my way, okay?

12:05.358 --> 12:07.427
Bubble bath? Yes.

12:07.460 --> 12:09.329
This is how, out of anger,

12:09.362 --> 12:11.865
you'd characterize me...
As a man that has

12:11.899 --> 12:15.302
been taking bubble baths since we've
begun this? Metaphorically-speaking, yeah,

12:15.335 --> 12:17.513
I'm comfortable with that characterization.
Okay, guys, enough. We need

12:17.537 --> 12:20.908
to find the animal responsible
for transferring the mutation.

12:20.941 --> 12:23.376
Lieutenant Marzan,
you'll take Jackson and Abe to Ydermo.

12:23.410 --> 12:26.213
Is that an order?
'Cause I don't see stripes on your sleeve.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.981
I don't need stripes.
I have a plane.

12:28.015 --> 12:29.382
The quicker we get what we need,

12:29.416 --> 12:31.018
the quicker you get
back to Sao Paolo.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.159
JACKSON: We're in the valley.

12:39.192 --> 12:41.061
Shouldn't the
fauna be more lush?

12:41.094 --> 12:42.796
We humped through here on foot.

12:42.830 --> 12:44.364
It's all like this.

12:46.566 --> 12:48.869
So what's up between
you and the scientist?

12:51.204 --> 12:54.875
We left a member
of our team behind.

12:54.908 --> 12:56.243
He blames me.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.278
Is he right to?

13:07.587 --> 13:09.556
What the hell kind
of rain is this?

13:16.997 --> 13:18.899
That's not rain.

13:27.207 --> 13:30.410
DARIELA: Trail gets
hairy from here on.

13:30.443 --> 13:33.546
We walk the rest
of the way on foot.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.415
(insects trilling)

13:45.893 --> 13:49.062
(screeching)

13:49.096 --> 13:51.064
I think it's acidic. Acid rain?

13:51.098 --> 13:52.565
ABRAHAM: Probably

13:52.599 --> 13:54.134
explains the dying fauna.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.936
JACKSON: Sure, but how?

13:55.969 --> 13:58.271
Not a lot of sources of
chemical pollution up here.

13:58.305 --> 14:00.207
ABRAHAM: Look at this.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.641
Is that ice?

14:01.674 --> 14:03.610
It's nowhere near freezing.

14:03.643 --> 14:06.479
Doesn't make sense.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.949
Nothing has since we've arrived.

14:08.982 --> 14:12.152
(man speaking Spanish)

14:12.185 --> 14:13.086
Stand back!

14:13.120 --> 14:14.554
I said stand back!

14:14.587 --> 14:16.423
Drop your weapon!
(Spanish continues)

14:16.456 --> 14:17.891
I said drop the weapon!

14:17.925 --> 14:19.927
Drop the weapon! Hey, hey!

14:19.960 --> 14:21.394
No habla Español.

14:21.428 --> 14:22.595
No habla Español.

14:22.629 --> 14:25.198
Do you speak English? English?

14:25.232 --> 14:27.267
You.

14:28.268 --> 14:30.337
You take the bodies?

14:33.306 --> 14:36.176
(birds singing)

14:36.209 --> 14:37.510
(labored breathing)

14:37.544 --> 14:40.313
(whispering): Kovacs...
can you hear me?

14:40.347 --> 14:42.615
(monitor beeping)

14:49.222 --> 14:50.390
I don't think he's gonna

14:50.423 --> 14:53.026
answer you.

14:53.060 --> 14:55.228
Pretty sure he can't.

14:57.164 --> 15:00.667
His physiology, biochemistry...
It's all changing.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.335
How?

15:02.369 --> 15:05.205
Well, his brain's only
lighting up around

15:05.238 --> 15:08.341
the basal ganglia.
It's the most primitive part of the brain.

15:08.375 --> 15:09.977
It's responsible
for our survival,

15:10.010 --> 15:12.612
instinct, aggression.

15:12.645 --> 15:15.282
Conversation, not so much.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.350
But the parts of his brain
that make him human...

15:17.384 --> 15:19.019
They're still there?

15:19.052 --> 15:21.021
Mm-hmm.

15:21.054 --> 15:23.690
It's like they're switched
off, though.

15:23.723 --> 15:26.259
And can we switch 'em back on?

15:30.397 --> 15:34.301
Uh, actually, yeah,
there might be a way.

15:34.334 --> 15:35.668
JACKSON: You should use tranqs.

15:35.702 --> 15:37.704
Whatever animal we
find we may need alive.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.572
Yeah, I've had this
conversation before.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.141
Not gonna happen.

15:41.174 --> 15:43.676
(birds singing)

15:47.747 --> 15:50.417
(screeching)

15:50.450 --> 15:53.353
Is it just me,
or are they following us?

16:00.227 --> 16:03.330
When we were here before,
there were more bodies.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.332
A lot more. Tomas,

16:05.365 --> 16:06.733
what happened here?

16:06.766 --> 16:09.369
First, rain like blood.

16:09.402 --> 16:11.471
Poison the water, food.

16:11.504 --> 16:14.241
Then come the Devil.

16:14.274 --> 16:15.608
Kill everyone.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.110
The Devil?

16:17.144 --> 16:18.611
Is he talking about...?

16:18.645 --> 16:19.679
Kovacs.

16:21.514 --> 16:24.651
Hey, Tomas, there was a
man, okay, a doctor. No.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.653
No doctor. We wait. He no come.

16:26.686 --> 16:30.523
Kovacs never arrived. Rafiki,

16:30.557 --> 16:34.161
does this look like
an elephant bite?

16:34.194 --> 16:35.628
It does.

16:35.662 --> 16:38.431
And those look like the
marks on Kovacs' body.

16:38.465 --> 16:39.766
This could lead to the cure.

16:39.799 --> 16:42.102
Could he have been
bitten by an elephant?

16:42.135 --> 16:44.637
Elephante. Elephant?

16:44.671 --> 16:46.806
In Patagonia? Sí.

16:46.839 --> 16:48.508
Elephante. Where?

16:48.541 --> 16:50.277
Come. I show.

16:50.310 --> 16:51.811
This is crazy.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.513
(radio static)

16:53.546 --> 16:56.716
What the hell?!

16:56.749 --> 17:00.387
Unknown caller. Say again. Over.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.689
Unknown caller.
I do not copy. Come on!

17:02.722 --> 17:04.790
Not copy! Say again. Over.

17:04.824 --> 17:06.569
Come on. It could just be interference.
Let's go.

17:06.593 --> 17:09.128
This radio operates on my
squad's secure channel.

17:09.162 --> 17:11.164
Only another team
radio can access it.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.665
Okay,
so where are the other radios?

17:12.699 --> 17:16.103
We buried them along with
the rest of her squad.

17:16.136 --> 17:17.704
(garbled radio transmission)

17:17.737 --> 17:20.272
Who the hell is this!?

17:27.847 --> 17:29.749
(birds cawing)

17:39.359 --> 17:41.128
(wolf howling)

17:50.570 --> 17:53.140
(sighs)

18:04.817 --> 18:06.653
(howling continues)

18:06.686 --> 18:08.588
(barking)

18:17.330 --> 18:19.199
(groans)

18:24.571 --> 18:27.307
(groaning)

18:33.746 --> 18:36.516
(sighs)

18:43.256 --> 18:45.392
(groans)

18:47.860 --> 18:49.929
(howling continues)

18:49.962 --> 18:53.166
(garbled radio transmission)

18:53.200 --> 18:55.535
I'm heading back to the hostel.

18:55.568 --> 18:56.712
Look, we have to find the
elephant that bit Kovacs.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.271
Stop calling him that!

18:58.305 --> 19:00.273
That thing is not Kovacs.

19:00.307 --> 19:02.842
I knew Kovacs. He's long gone.
But this...?

19:02.875 --> 19:04.677
If one of my guys is alive,

19:04.711 --> 19:06.879
the last thing I'm doing is
chasing down some elephant.

19:08.281 --> 19:10.617
Look, I was there with you.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.753
I still have the blood and
dirt under my fingernails.

19:13.786 --> 19:16.423
Those men we put under
the ground are dead.

19:16.456 --> 19:19.359
I don't have time for this.

19:19.392 --> 19:22.295
Are you going to
give me the keys?

19:22.329 --> 19:24.597
Or am I going to have
to take them from you?

19:30.470 --> 19:31.571
If you don't want

19:31.604 --> 19:33.473
to give her the keys, rafiki,

19:33.506 --> 19:35.174
you can give them to me.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.851
We'll meet you at the main road.

19:44.884 --> 19:47.420
You be careful.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.790
You didn't have
to do that for me.

19:50.823 --> 19:53.260
Actually, I did it for him.

19:53.293 --> 19:56.896
You looked pretty serious
about getting the keys.

19:56.929 --> 19:59.466
I'll drive. (laughs)

20:12.612 --> 20:15.282
Hey. Hey!

20:15.315 --> 20:17.484
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

20:17.517 --> 20:18.851
Officer!

20:18.885 --> 20:20.687
Officer, help.

20:20.720 --> 20:21.921
Officer.

20:22.622 --> 20:25.458
(snarling)

20:25.492 --> 20:27.394
(gasps)

20:27.427 --> 20:29.329
(raccoons squealing)

20:31.564 --> 20:34.000
(muttering)

20:36.369 --> 20:37.837
(grunts)

20:52.385 --> 20:55.021
Oh, please, please,
please, please, please.

20:55.054 --> 20:56.889
(engine clicking)

20:56.923 --> 20:58.525
Oh, come on.

20:58.558 --> 21:00.593
(whining): Oh, come on.

21:00.627 --> 21:02.929
No, no, no, no, no, God.

21:02.962 --> 21:05.498
(groaning)

21:08.401 --> 21:10.069
You're okay.

21:10.102 --> 21:12.905
You're okay.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.941
Caraquet.

21:14.974 --> 21:17.677
Caraquet.

21:17.710 --> 21:20.347
Caraquet.

21:20.380 --> 21:24.016
So the plan is to
stimulate the neocortex.

21:24.050 --> 21:25.952
That's the most evolved
part of the brain.

21:25.985 --> 21:27.387
That's the part of the brain

21:27.420 --> 21:29.556
responsible for speech?

21:29.589 --> 21:31.358
More precisely,
the part that makes us human.

21:31.391 --> 21:33.092
Language,

21:33.125 --> 21:34.494
social structure,

21:34.527 --> 21:36.696
self-control, empathy.

21:36.729 --> 21:37.964
Putting the toilet seat down.

21:37.997 --> 21:40.066
All the things we
know we should do

21:40.099 --> 21:42.435
to be productive
members of society.

21:42.469 --> 21:44.804
All thanks to the neocortex.

21:44.837 --> 21:46.473
Will it hurt him?

21:49.942 --> 21:51.110
No, he'll be fine.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.513
Just a small electronic pulse,

21:53.546 --> 21:55.348
kind of like a static shock.

21:59.786 --> 22:02.755
What? Is there something
you're not telling me?

22:04.491 --> 22:06.125
Kovacs proves that the mutation

22:06.158 --> 22:07.794
has spread to humans.

22:07.827 --> 22:08.995
Finding a new cure

22:09.028 --> 22:10.930
is more important than ever.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.499
(groaning)

22:12.532 --> 22:14.634
Isabel... bella.

22:21.107 --> 22:22.942
What is that?

22:26.112 --> 22:28.581
I think he's... crying.

22:29.782 --> 22:32.051
(choking)

22:32.084 --> 22:34.554
He's crashing. What did you do?

22:34.587 --> 22:35.864
I didn't even
start the test yet.

22:35.888 --> 22:37.790
What's happening?
We've got to cut him loose.

22:37.824 --> 22:39.759
We can't lose him.
Turn him over on his side.

22:39.792 --> 22:40.960
He's going to choke.

22:40.993 --> 22:42.762
Come on, over.

22:42.795 --> 22:44.664
(gasping)

22:45.932 --> 22:47.400
(groaning)

22:48.468 --> 22:50.437
(grunts)

23:13.225 --> 23:14.827
If one of my guys is effected,

23:14.861 --> 23:17.196
changed like Kovacs,
I'm putting him down.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.998
End of discussion.

23:19.031 --> 23:21.468
Let's hope it does
not come to that.

23:24.637 --> 23:25.805
The body.

23:25.838 --> 23:28.708
This is where we buried Ward.

23:28.741 --> 23:29.976
He's gone.

23:31.811 --> 23:34.180
There are no tracks
around the grave.

23:34.213 --> 23:36.816
No signs to say that
was dragged out,

23:36.849 --> 23:38.150
or walked away.

23:38.184 --> 23:39.552
It's like he just...

23:39.586 --> 23:41.588
Disappeared.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.726
Trotter?

23:46.759 --> 23:49.028
Trotter, if you can hear
me, stay in the cockpit.

23:49.061 --> 23:50.630
Lock the door.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.709
Screw this.

24:02.742 --> 24:03.752
I think we should
go check the bar.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.044
Why?

24:05.077 --> 24:06.879
Well, I don't know,
wasn't alcohol invented

24:06.913 --> 24:08.147
for times like this?

24:29.769 --> 24:31.771
(sighs)

24:33.540 --> 24:35.207
(door closes)

24:43.249 --> 24:46.519
I'm sorry we couldn't
find anything.

24:46.553 --> 24:49.589
Ward was going to name
his daughter Hermione.

24:49.622 --> 24:51.991
She's due any day now.

24:52.024 --> 24:53.225
Hermione.

24:53.259 --> 24:56.195
That's a terrible name.

24:56.228 --> 24:59.632
He loved Harry Potter.

24:59.666 --> 25:01.801
She's a character
in Harry Potter.

25:01.834 --> 25:05.805
Girl wizard or witch...
whatever.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.907
Ward said he wanted
that for his daughter.

25:07.940 --> 25:09.842
That she be a witch?

25:11.644 --> 25:13.279
That she have magic in her.

25:13.312 --> 25:14.847
Magic.

25:14.881 --> 25:17.617
How come you've been
acting so nice to me,

25:17.650 --> 25:19.018
Bubble Bath?

25:19.051 --> 25:21.821
Well, I find,
all things considered,

25:21.854 --> 25:24.591
it's easier being
nice, than not nice.

25:24.624 --> 25:27.794
(screeching overhead)

25:27.827 --> 25:28.961
Did you see...?

25:30.730 --> 25:31.998
It's Ward's body.

25:33.265 --> 25:35.301
DARIELA: 150 yards out.

25:36.335 --> 25:37.637
2:00.

25:37.670 --> 25:38.838
Faster.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.740
Faster, we're losing him!

25:44.844 --> 25:46.946
I see something.

25:46.979 --> 25:48.214
What is that?

25:51.851 --> 25:53.953
(screeching)

26:00.259 --> 26:01.794
DARIELA: Oh, my God.

26:01.828 --> 26:03.708
ABRAHAM: It looks like
they're stockpiling food.

26:05.164 --> 26:06.699
But why?

26:06.733 --> 26:08.234
I don't know.

26:08.267 --> 26:09.936
Vultures are not hoarders.

26:09.969 --> 26:13.606
They eat their fill and move on.

26:13.640 --> 26:17.143
(bird screeching)

26:17.176 --> 26:18.611
Is that ice?

26:22.649 --> 26:24.116
Dariela, no!

26:26.185 --> 26:27.920
(screeching)

26:34.026 --> 26:35.026
(gunshots)

26:39.065 --> 26:40.967
(yelling)

26:41.834 --> 26:43.636
(grunts)

26:43.670 --> 26:44.804
We have to go.

26:44.837 --> 26:46.673
We have to go!

26:55.715 --> 26:57.650
Why did you do that?

26:57.684 --> 26:58.751
For this.

27:09.295 --> 27:12.331
One more step.

27:12.364 --> 27:15.101
Just one more step.

27:15.134 --> 27:17.670
Put your foot in
front of the other,

27:17.704 --> 27:19.972
and then repeat.

27:20.006 --> 27:21.708
Like, a million more times.

27:21.741 --> 27:23.843
(chittering)

27:26.746 --> 27:28.781
Just a critter.

27:31.417 --> 27:33.720
Yeah, just a critter

27:33.753 --> 27:35.263
says the woman who saw a
raccoon family eat dinner

27:35.287 --> 27:37.690
on a police officer's chest.

27:37.724 --> 27:39.391
(louder chittering)

27:41.728 --> 27:42.962
(gasping) Help me.

27:42.995 --> 27:44.964
Help me.

27:48.768 --> 27:50.903
Come, mira.

27:56.142 --> 27:57.376
Elefante?

27:57.409 --> 27:59.011
Sí.

27:59.045 --> 28:00.246
This way.

28:17.997 --> 28:20.366
(exhales)

28:34.446 --> 28:37.116
Damn.

28:37.149 --> 28:40.019
(sighs)

28:43.823 --> 28:46.025
(groans)

28:56.936 --> 29:00.039
Isabella...

29:00.072 --> 29:02.408
(speaking Hungarian)

29:02.441 --> 29:04.210
Kovacs.

29:04.243 --> 29:07.346
(speaking Hungarian), Isabella.

29:11.317 --> 29:13.953
A man couldn't bite off
his own arm to get free...

29:16.222 --> 29:18.557
but a man with the Phase
Two mutation could.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.359
(elephant growling)

29:22.061 --> 29:24.797
Elefante.

29:24.831 --> 29:27.466
(growling)

29:28.600 --> 29:29.969
(breathing heavily)

29:32.872 --> 29:34.506
We need to get his blood.

29:36.508 --> 29:38.978
No, no.

29:39.011 --> 29:40.346
No good, no good.

29:40.379 --> 29:41.480
(bellowing)

29:41.513 --> 29:43.249
No choice.

30:05.137 --> 30:06.839
Mitch.

30:16.382 --> 30:18.284
He's alive.

30:18.317 --> 30:19.351
(power clicking)

30:22.421 --> 30:25.524
Son of a bitch is
just toying with us.

30:25.557 --> 30:27.559
(Kovacs howls)

30:30.429 --> 30:32.431
(elephant growling)

30:53.085 --> 30:55.087
(bellowing)

30:58.190 --> 31:00.226
Go! Go! Go!

31:01.227 --> 31:04.163
Run!

31:04.196 --> 31:05.932
Damn it.

31:05.965 --> 31:07.967
(bellowing)

31:15.007 --> 31:17.476
(tires screeching)

31:20.679 --> 31:22.048
(elephant bellowing)

31:22.081 --> 31:23.149
That was an elephant.

31:23.182 --> 31:25.484
I think it's behind us.

31:26.618 --> 31:28.287
Come on, come on.

31:29.255 --> 31:30.489
Stop!

31:33.092 --> 31:34.426
We got to run.

31:34.460 --> 31:35.461
Come on!

31:35.494 --> 31:36.929
Come on, rafiki!

31:36.963 --> 31:38.097
Go, go, go!

31:38.130 --> 31:39.932
Come on.

31:39.966 --> 31:41.600
Tomas.

31:41.633 --> 31:43.169
DARIELA: Hey! Tomas! Tomas!

31:43.202 --> 31:44.636
(bellowing)

31:44.670 --> 31:45.671
Tomas!

31:50.142 --> 31:51.210
No!

31:51.243 --> 31:54.146
Ayúdame!

31:55.414 --> 31:58.217
(groans)

31:58.250 --> 32:00.186
Oh!

32:00.219 --> 32:02.354
Come on, come on!

32:03.555 --> 32:05.491
Go! Go, go!

32:05.524 --> 32:07.126
Get in the car!

32:07.159 --> 32:08.260
Get in, get in, get in!

32:10.762 --> 32:13.532
Go, go, go!

32:13.565 --> 32:15.101
Come on, Abe,
let's get out of here!

32:18.304 --> 32:20.139
(elephant groans)

32:20.172 --> 32:22.008
How did an African
elephant find its way

32:22.041 --> 32:23.009
to Patagonia?

32:23.042 --> 32:24.143
I don't know, Abe.

32:24.176 --> 32:26.312
You want to jump
out and ask him?

32:38.757 --> 32:40.559
(Kovacs growls)

32:40.592 --> 32:41.960
(elephant bellowing)

32:46.365 --> 32:47.399
(Kovacs grunts)

32:54.740 --> 32:57.176
(Kovacs grunts)

32:57.209 --> 32:58.577
Get out!

32:58.610 --> 33:00.479
Watch out!

33:03.115 --> 33:04.450
Quick, out of the way!

33:04.483 --> 33:05.351
(Kovacs grunts)

33:05.384 --> 33:06.352
Go!

33:06.385 --> 33:07.519
(Kovacs groans)

33:09.755 --> 33:12.324
(Kovacs groans)

33:12.358 --> 33:14.493
(growling)

33:17.429 --> 33:19.331
Next time you're the bait.

33:19.365 --> 33:20.666
You're welcome.

33:20.699 --> 33:22.601
(Kovacs growling)

33:22.634 --> 33:25.504
(elephant bellowing)

33:27.106 --> 33:28.340
These aren't working!

33:28.374 --> 33:29.475
We need a new plan.

33:29.508 --> 33:30.508
I have an idea.

33:32.144 --> 33:33.388
(phone ringing) You're
lucky to be alive.

33:33.412 --> 33:34.613
I'm fine, Doc.

33:34.646 --> 33:36.148
Abraham. Chloe.

33:36.182 --> 33:38.184
Tell Trotter to get
the plane moving now.

33:38.217 --> 33:39.485
What? Now!

33:39.518 --> 33:41.387
Please tell me
you're okay to fly.

33:41.420 --> 33:43.422
I'm always okay to fly. Good.

33:43.455 --> 33:44.423
We're good to fly.

33:44.456 --> 33:45.724
Good.

33:45.757 --> 33:47.693
Tell him to start
takeoff procedures.

33:47.726 --> 33:49.261
But we're not
leaving without you.

33:49.295 --> 33:50.362
You better not.

33:50.396 --> 33:51.697
Open the cargo ramp

33:51.730 --> 33:53.599
and tell Trotter to
be ready to floor it.

33:53.632 --> 33:57.169
Are you...
Okay, just don't miss.

33:57.203 --> 34:00.406
(tires squealing)

34:07.446 --> 34:08.614
I'm out.

34:08.647 --> 34:10.681
Come on, he's gaining on us.

34:19.858 --> 34:21.760
Is that an elephant?

34:22.828 --> 34:24.763
Faster, Abe, faster.

34:24.795 --> 34:26.364
You got this, come on.

34:28.766 --> 34:30.536
Go, go.

34:35.474 --> 34:37.376
Yeah, come on.
Come on, it's now or never.

34:37.409 --> 34:39.178
Okay, hold on!

34:40.446 --> 34:41.713
(engine revving)

34:41.746 --> 34:44.583
Faster, come on. Abe, faster!

34:45.717 --> 34:47.286
(metal crunching) (grunting)

34:48.853 --> 34:50.856
(tires squealing)

34:53.359 --> 34:55.293
Trotter, go.

34:55.327 --> 34:56.328
(whooping)

34:56.362 --> 34:57.496
We did it!

35:06.305 --> 35:08.307
(elephant bellowing)

35:16.215 --> 35:17.459
JAMIE: You scared
the hell out of me.

35:17.483 --> 35:18.617
LOGAN: Sorry.

35:18.650 --> 35:20.386
The name is Logan. I'm Jamie.

35:22.788 --> 35:26.458
Logan... use your armpits.

35:26.492 --> 35:28.160
For what?

35:28.194 --> 35:31.197
Tuck your fingers
under your armpits.

35:31.230 --> 35:32.631
When your body's freezing,

35:32.664 --> 35:33.932
it focuses all its energy

35:33.965 --> 35:35.701
to keep your vital organs warm,

35:35.734 --> 35:39.405
so your torso stays toasty.

35:43.375 --> 35:44.710
Thanks.

35:44.743 --> 35:47.346
So were you just
chilling in the woods,

35:47.379 --> 35:49.315
waiting for someone to
scare the bejeezus out of?

35:49.348 --> 35:50.549
Yeah.

35:51.817 --> 35:53.919
You got me.

35:53.952 --> 35:56.188
I was about to give up, too.

35:56.222 --> 35:59.258
Lucky for me that
you came along.

35:59.291 --> 36:02.394
You made it all... worthwhile.

36:02.428 --> 36:07.533
Well,
I'm happy to be of service.

36:07.566 --> 36:09.268
Thank you for the coat.

36:09.301 --> 36:10.736
Sure.

36:10.769 --> 36:11.970
Some kind of gentleman

36:12.003 --> 36:13.405
I'm turning out to be, right?

36:13.439 --> 36:14.706
It's the man who's supposed

36:14.740 --> 36:17.476
to give up his
coat for the lady.

36:18.910 --> 36:20.579
Not vice versa.

36:22.781 --> 36:24.750
We're gonna die out
here, aren't we?

36:24.783 --> 36:26.218
Oh, no.

36:26.252 --> 36:27.586
No, no, no, no, no.

36:27.619 --> 36:29.821
No one's dying out here.

36:29.855 --> 36:32.391
We made it this far,

36:32.424 --> 36:34.226
we're gonna make it
the rest of the way.

36:35.761 --> 36:37.263
Rest of the way to what?

36:37.296 --> 36:39.831
Look around,
there's nothing out here.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.235
Hey.

36:44.636 --> 36:46.472
See this?

36:46.505 --> 36:48.440
This is where we're going.

36:49.708 --> 36:51.943
There's shelter.

36:51.977 --> 36:53.479
There's hope.

36:53.512 --> 36:54.680
And if we're lucky,

36:54.713 --> 36:57.249
there's a hell of
a lot of vodka...

36:57.283 --> 36:58.517
in Caraquet.

37:05.724 --> 37:07.034
ABRAHAM: There were
bodies everywhere.

37:07.058 --> 37:08.794
Stacked like firewood.

37:08.827 --> 37:10.929
Never before have I
seen a wake this large

37:10.962 --> 37:12.564
descend from above the clouds.

37:12.598 --> 37:14.800
What were they doing up there?

37:14.833 --> 37:16.768
I think they were responsible
for the blood rain

37:16.802 --> 37:18.036
that drove the villagers away.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.938
How is that possible?

37:19.971 --> 37:21.640
As much as I hate to admit it...

37:21.673 --> 37:22.841
he's right.

37:22.874 --> 37:24.810
Ran some tests on the rain

37:24.843 --> 37:26.778
while I was waiting for
the results on that, uh,

37:26.812 --> 37:28.380
elephant blood you brought back.

37:28.414 --> 37:30.916
So the vultures are
responsible for the rain?

37:30.949 --> 37:32.384
This blood rain

37:32.418 --> 37:33.719
is highly acidic,

37:33.752 --> 37:35.321
and the protein structure

37:35.354 --> 37:36.864
matches the corrosive
bile that vultures

37:36.888 --> 37:38.065
have in their digestive tract.

37:38.089 --> 37:40.992
How did the bile
get into the brain?

37:41.026 --> 37:42.661
The frozen feather.

37:42.694 --> 37:44.996
It's cold at 40,000 feet.

37:45.030 --> 37:47.032
The vultures feed,
they fly above the cloud cover.

37:47.065 --> 37:49.468
And that high up,
they can seed the clouds

37:49.501 --> 37:51.370
with acidic bile.

37:51.403 --> 37:52.780
But they were
stockpiling human bodies.

37:52.804 --> 37:53.872
So you're saying that...

37:53.905 --> 37:54.940
The red color?

37:54.973 --> 37:56.007
It's blood.

37:56.041 --> 37:57.042
Human blood.

38:00.045 --> 38:01.780
So not only did they
feed on the villagers,

38:01.813 --> 38:04.483
but they poisoned
their water supply,

38:04.516 --> 38:06.785
destroyed their crops.

38:10.422 --> 38:13.058
This is a whole new level
aberrant aggressive behavior.

38:35.046 --> 38:37.048
(metal rattles)

38:41.987 --> 38:45.624
"My dear, sweet Hermione."

38:47.526 --> 38:51.497
"I can only pray that you
never have to read this.

38:51.530 --> 38:55.734
"That your young life will,
of course, include me.

38:55.767 --> 38:59.037
"But if you are reading this,

38:59.070 --> 39:02.941
it is because..."

39:05.010 --> 39:07.546
(sighs heavily)

39:08.947 --> 39:10.124
JACKSON: Well,
how about the elephant

39:10.148 --> 39:11.783
blood that I brought back in?

39:11.817 --> 39:13.084
Unremarkable.

39:13.118 --> 39:14.820
We've seen plenty

39:14.853 --> 39:17.489
of animals with the same
mutation, right?

39:17.523 --> 39:19.066
If there was something
special about the elephant,

39:19.090 --> 39:20.726
I could attribute
that mutation transfer

39:20.759 --> 39:22.428
to that, but it's...

39:22.461 --> 39:23.505
But it isn't about the elephant.

39:23.529 --> 39:25.063
It's about the man.

39:25.096 --> 39:27.966
So you're saying that
there's something

39:27.999 --> 39:30.168
specific about
Kovacs' genetic makeup

39:30.201 --> 39:33.739
that made it possible for
the mutation to occur in him.

39:33.772 --> 39:35.441
MITCH: Yeah,
that's what it looks like.

39:35.474 --> 39:36.942
Now, I think it's gonna take

39:36.975 --> 39:39.144
a little time to figure
out what that is exactly.

39:39.177 --> 39:40.011
Fine.

39:40.045 --> 39:41.580
Then you run more tests.

39:41.613 --> 39:43.114
We have him, we have a chance.

39:43.148 --> 39:45.150
We can study him and
maybe (door opens)

39:45.183 --> 39:46.952
learn how to reverse it.

39:46.985 --> 39:49.555
You let that thing loose again?

39:49.588 --> 39:51.557
Dariela, now is not the time.

39:51.590 --> 39:54.001
Instead of putting it down,
you let it loose again... I'm sorry

39:54.025 --> 39:56.003
about your friends,
but they died in the line of duty.

39:56.027 --> 39:57.128
And right now, there's only

39:57.162 --> 39:58.464
one person that matters.

39:58.497 --> 39:59.765
Janos Kovacs.

39:59.798 --> 40:01.075
Stop saying that.
That's not him.

40:01.099 --> 40:02.601
Yes, it is.

40:02.634 --> 40:03.869
He's still in there!

40:03.902 --> 40:05.604
No, he's not.
