our county's best interest,

00:05.664 --> 00:07.887
and my fathers profit margins.

00:07.888 --> 00:11.563
Trust me I'll choose
Absaroka every time.

00:11.564 --> 00:13.635
You can never tell when
he's telling the truth.

00:13.636 --> 00:16.919
- So where you been?
- San Francisco, Denver.

00:16.920 --> 00:18.604
Denver? What did you do in Denver?

00:18.605 --> 00:21.136
Has there been any hit on that
name I gave you awhile back?

00:21.137 --> 00:24.447
Anybody looks in to this Henry
Standing Bear guy I'll call you.

00:24.448 --> 00:28.213
Wasn't your job to kill
that man, it was mine to do.

00:28.214 --> 00:30.095
That was my right.

Walt. Uh, it's Ferg here.

01:55.433 --> 01:58.124
Ruby stepped away, so
I am Manning the radio.

01:58.125 --> 02:00.738
How are the, uh, repossessions going?

02:00.739 --> 02:02.406
Still waiting for Branch.

02:02.407 --> 02:04.692
He was supposed to meet
me here 30 minutes ago.

02:04.693 --> 02:06.723
See if you can track him down.

02:06.724 --> 02:09.193
Uh, oh, here he is.

02:09.193 --> 02:12.795
I mean, here's a note that
was left on Ruby's desk.

02:12.796 --> 02:15.904
"Branch called. Guess he's sick"?

02:15.905 --> 02:16.914
[Radio static]

02:16.915 --> 02:19.213
Either that... or he didn't
want to be throwing people

02:19.214 --> 02:21.460
out of their homes with an
election around the corner.

02:21.461 --> 02:23.681
[Clatters]

02:23.850 --> 02:26.044
My whole life is in this
place. This is my home, man.

02:26.045 --> 02:27.854
If you could just give
me a couple of days,

02:27.855 --> 02:31.086
I'll have the money a-and
you wouldn't have to do this.

02:31.087 --> 02:34.575
Already had your 60 days
to pay under the law.

02:34.576 --> 02:36.907
Told you that 30 days ago.

02:36.908 --> 02:38.299
And here we are again.

02:38.300 --> 02:41.399
This isn't up to me, Mr. Murphy. I don't
want to be here any more than you do.

02:41.400 --> 02:43.210
I'm good for it. Ask anybody.

02:43.211 --> 02:46.274
Hell, ask your deputy,
Branch. Me and him go way back.

02:46.275 --> 02:48.158

[Radio static] Ferg: Walt, you there?

03:00.592 --> 03:01.715
[Grunts]

03:01.716 --> 03:03.550
Go ahead, Ferg.

03:03.551 --> 03:07.970
A trucker called and reported
an abandoned horse off Route 18.

03:07.971 --> 03:11.849
Said it's been running around the farm
fields out there and tearing up the crops.

03:11.850 --> 03:16.270
Vic is out on another call right
now, so you want me to head out there?

03:16.271 --> 03:18.902
No. I need you to
stay and mind the shop.

03:18.903 --> 03:22.251
Okay. Want me to call Branch,
see if he's feeling any better?

03:22.252 --> 03:28.152
I'll take care of it. I have
another job in mind for Branch.

03:33.988 --> 03:35.923

04:03.303 --> 04:07.203
She's dragging a man behind her.

04:07.322 --> 04:08.871
Is he alive?

04:08.872 --> 04:10.097
[Radio static]

04:10.098 --> 04:12.498
I hope not.

04:17.865 --> 04:20.781
She tries to jump that fence,
she'll get all tripped up.

04:20.783 --> 04:22.299
Could kill her.

04:22.300 --> 04:27.520
Keep her on course. We
just got one shot at this.

05:32.623 --> 05:34.483

05:36.596 --> 05:38.756
Come on.

05:44.415 --> 05:46.455
[Sighs]

06:01.649 --> 06:04.401
Bullet went all the way
through his neck. No slug.

06:04.402 --> 06:06.357
Whoever shot him was
probably at close range.

06:06.358 --> 06:09.078
- Who is he?
- It's tough to tell.

06:09.079 --> 06:12.099
His back pockets are torn,
so no wallet. Nothing.

06:12.100 --> 06:15.759
I'll roll a fresh set of prints, send
to the DMV, see if we can't identify him.

06:15.760 --> 06:17.653
I see you made a full recovery.

06:17.654 --> 06:19.895
Better, thanks.

06:19.896 --> 06:22.779
Ferg called. Said a guy
was dragged by a horse.

06:22.780 --> 06:24.419
Wild horse.

06:24.420 --> 06:26.997
Got a heavy winter coat, no shoes.

06:26.998 --> 06:29.465
My guess, he's just been herd torn.

06:29.466 --> 06:32.451
That's a pretty nice
saddle for a wild horse.

06:32.452 --> 06:36.013
Vic: So you figure he was
riding the horse and he got shot?

06:36.014 --> 06:38.882
Gunshot goes off, spooks
the horse, he runs.

06:38.883 --> 06:41.611
Victim falls off, gets
tangled in the ropes?

06:41.612 --> 06:44.226
That knot's a bowline.

06:44.227 --> 06:46.395
Someone tied him to the saddle.

06:46.396 --> 06:48.443
Why shoot somebody and
then tie him to a horse?

06:48.444 --> 06:49.985
It seems like overkill.

06:49.986 --> 06:53.030
Murderer probably wanted
to get rid of the body.

06:53.031 --> 06:54.774
That's where the trail ends.

06:54.775 --> 06:56.738
Let's see where it started.

06:56.739 --> 07:00.579
Vic, get that horse to the vet.

07:03.107 --> 07:04.313
Hey, Walt.

07:04.314 --> 07:07.186
I guess I'll take the
body to Doc Bloomfield's.

07:07.187 --> 07:10.714
Only if you're feeling up to it.

07:10.715 --> 07:12.045
Good.

07:12.046 --> 07:14.684
After that, pay a visit to
your buddy Travis Murphy.

07:14.685 --> 07:17.051
Travis? Why?

07:17.052 --> 07:20.673
You need to take
possession of his property.

07:20.674 --> 07:23.725
[Camera shutter clicks]

07:23.726 --> 07:27.044
You seem more than usually
irritated with Branch.

07:27.045 --> 07:32.945
He's so focused on the election,
he's barely doing his job.

07:34.259 --> 07:37.499
The trail is lost here.

07:37.892 --> 07:40.925
There are at least a
dozen other hoof prints.

07:40.926 --> 07:43.446
What is this?

07:46.370 --> 07:49.010
It's an arena.

07:49.832 --> 07:53.672
Looks like the rodeo's in town.

07:59.344 --> 08:01.612
Durant's got a big rodeo
arena right in town.

08:01.613 --> 08:05.299
Why come all the way out
here just to put on a rodeo?

08:05.300 --> 08:10.471
Do it in town, you got to deal
with permits, rules, insurance...

08:10.472 --> 08:13.352

08:13.535 --> 08:15.217
Come out here, and anything goes.

08:15.218 --> 08:16.833
Yeah.

08:16.834 --> 08:18.462
I can see that.

08:18.463 --> 08:22.266
All this land's owned by the same guy
who owns the illegal rodeo grounds.

08:22.267 --> 08:24.933
Yeah. Only it's not a
guy, it's a company...

08:24.934 --> 08:28.053
Uh, Beltro Corporate Farms LLC.

08:28.054 --> 08:30.655
Sugar beets, corn, and alfalfa.

08:30.656 --> 08:33.537
Corporations came out
here about 15 years ago.

08:33.538 --> 08:36.287
Bought up all the family operations.

08:36.288 --> 08:40.607
Hard to tell who owns what these days.

08:52.392 --> 08:55.378
Hey, you got a second?

08:55.379 --> 08:59.099
Weston: Can I help you folks?!

08:59.781 --> 09:01.086
You the Foreman here?

09:01.087 --> 09:03.727
No. Cal Weston.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.114
Just a hired hand.

09:06.115 --> 09:09.580
Dealing with the corporate
bosses ain't my strong suit.

09:09.581 --> 09:11.466
It's tough explaining
farming to fellas that

09:11.467 --> 09:13.343
never held a spade before in their life.

09:13.344 --> 09:15.209
Titus Griffin's the Foreman.

09:15.210 --> 09:16.672
Is he around?

09:16.673 --> 09:20.035
Uh, I haven't seen him this morning.

09:20.036 --> 09:21.719
We're pretty low on supplies.

09:21.720 --> 09:26.040
He might've gone into town to restock.

09:26.090 --> 09:28.091
Is there some kind of problem?

09:28.092 --> 09:32.812
Got evidence of an illegal rodeo that
was held on the property last night.

09:32.813 --> 09:36.149
You or any of the workers
happen to know about that?

09:36.150 --> 09:37.734
No.

09:37.735 --> 09:39.152
I had no idea.

09:39.153 --> 09:41.404
I live in town, and I left around 7:00.

09:41.405 --> 09:44.073
I didn't see anything
out of the ordinary.

09:44.074 --> 09:46.640
I can't speak for the workers
that live in the barracks, though.

09:46.641 --> 09:50.496
But Titus lives on site. He probably has a
better idea of how they spent the evening.

09:50.497 --> 09:53.082
We need to talk to Titus immediately.

09:53.083 --> 09:55.569
Have him call the
station when he gets back.

09:55.570 --> 09:58.171
We also need to alert the
company about the rodeo.

09:58.172 --> 09:59.756
Think you can get their number for us?

09:59.757 --> 10:03.177
Sure. I'll be right back.

10:06.199 --> 10:10.115
Conveniently left out the part
about the guy being murdered.

10:10.116 --> 10:12.556
[Clears throat]

10:12.557 --> 10:15.609
Murder most likely
happened at the rodeo.

10:15.610 --> 10:18.645
I'm sure some of these
workers were there.

10:18.646 --> 10:24.546
If news of the crime spreads, evidence
and witnesses start to disappear.

10:24.837 --> 10:27.317
We need to talk to the
Foreman before word gets out.

10:27.318 --> 10:29.944
He may be able to put
us onto some suspects.

10:29.945 --> 10:34.475
Doesn't look like we'll
be in short supply.

10:53.405 --> 10:55.542
Hey, brother. Been a long time.

10:55.543 --> 10:58.338
- Yeah, it has.
- We missed you at the last reunion.

10:58.339 --> 10:59.589
Mm-hmm.

10:59.590 --> 11:02.173
I had no idea you were
camped out here in a trailer.

11:02.174 --> 11:04.324
Yeah, well, I'm not
big on material things.

11:04.325 --> 11:07.180
Stuff like that just kind of holds
you back, you know what I'm saying?

11:07.181 --> 11:11.229
Plus, it makes it easier when I need to
pack up and hit the old rodeo circuit.

11:11.230 --> 11:13.429
- So you still ride?
- Yeah, man.

11:13.430 --> 11:16.115
Hell yeah. I'm surprised
you gave it up that easy.

11:16.116 --> 11:20.225
Yeah, well, we all got
to grow up sometime.

11:20.226 --> 11:24.224
Think you know why I'm here, Travis.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.685
Yeah. [Sighs]

11:28.366 --> 11:30.946
Look, I, uh...

11:32.378 --> 11:35.169
I don't have the money
to pay the bank right now.

11:35.170 --> 11:40.271
I got injured in the ring and
had to sit out for a few months.

11:40.272 --> 11:42.417
You know how it is.

11:42.418 --> 11:45.035
But look, man, I-I'm
back in the saddle now.

11:45.036 --> 11:48.152
And there's a few local venues
that I'm looking to hit up.

11:48.153 --> 11:51.374
Two more days, man. I guarantee
you I'll have the money.

11:51.375 --> 11:55.128
You think you could talk to that hard
ass boss of yours, buy me some time?

11:55.129 --> 11:56.479
[Sighs]

11:56.480 --> 11:57.964
Yeah.

11:57.965 --> 12:01.635
I can float you the cash till
you get back on your feet.

12:01.636 --> 12:04.304
I don't want your charity, man.

12:04.305 --> 12:06.355
That's not what this is.

12:06.356 --> 12:08.105
I help you...

12:08.106 --> 12:09.909
You help me.

12:09.910 --> 12:14.472
Walt mentioned there's an illegal
rodeo that's been operating in the area.

12:14.473 --> 12:18.516
You hear when the
next one's happening...

12:18.517 --> 12:21.637
Maybe give me a call.

12:22.557 --> 12:24.477
Yeah.

12:28.296 --> 12:30.880
An illegal rodeo? [Chuckles]

12:30.881 --> 12:36.119
I've been the Beltro Corporate Manager for
this area of Wyoming for going on 10 years.

12:36.120 --> 12:38.338
<i>We never had that problem before.</i>

12:38.339 --> 12:42.843
I'm afraid this case is a bit more
complicated than that, Mr. Frier.

12:42.844 --> 12:46.024
Man was found murdered.

12:46.158 --> 12:47.777
My God.

12:47.778 --> 12:50.538
[Breathes heavily]

12:51.346 --> 12:53.146
Oh.

12:54.405 --> 12:56.516
That's, uh, Titus Griffin.

12:56.517 --> 12:58.109
He, uh...

12:58.110 --> 13:00.591
He's one of our foremen.

13:00.592 --> 13:02.646
What happened to him?

13:02.647 --> 13:05.314
You know if he had any
family? Wife or children?

13:05.315 --> 13:07.450
No. He, uh...

13:07.451 --> 13:10.510
He lived alone at the company house.

13:10.511 --> 13:14.258
He devoted most of his
time to running the farm.

13:14.259 --> 13:16.159
Paid off, too.

13:16.160 --> 13:17.304
I mean, his...

13:17.305 --> 13:21.752
His property's one of the
highest-grossing farms Beltro owns.

13:21.753 --> 13:24.033
I wish I had 10 men like him.

13:24.034 --> 13:25.969
Always made me look good.

13:25.970 --> 13:27.246
[Sighs]

13:27.247 --> 13:29.581
Sometimes, uh...

13:29.582 --> 13:32.206
What makes a man
profitable to a company...

13:32.207 --> 13:34.500
Doesn't make him
popular with his workers.

13:34.501 --> 13:36.714
You ever have a problem
with any of the laborers?

13:36.715 --> 13:39.478
He took a hard line with them.

13:39.479 --> 13:42.064
That's what you do when you're the boss.

13:42.065 --> 13:44.120
I mean...

13:44.121 --> 13:47.601
All your deputies like you?

13:47.820 --> 13:50.310
Any men that work under
Titus have a record?

13:50.311 --> 13:51.291
Well...

13:51.292 --> 13:54.058
Field hands don't really
come with references.

13:54.059 --> 13:57.061
- You mean they're illegal?
- No, no. [Chuckles]

13:57.062 --> 14:00.315
No, the company has a policy,
strictly forbids that.

14:00.316 --> 14:03.415
I just... I mean, the men are seasonal.

14:03.416 --> 14:06.388
And with a transient
labor force you're never...

14:06.389 --> 14:09.493
Exactly sure what you're getting.

14:09.494 --> 14:12.434
Yeah. Appreciate it.

14:12.949 --> 14:17.766
Uh, we need to question all
the men that work under Titus.

14:17.767 --> 14:19.959
I'll... I'll fax you
over a list right away.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.650
Thank you. Sorry.

14:21.651 --> 14:23.489
Walt.

14:23.490 --> 14:25.131
So, I just got off with the vet.

14:25.132 --> 14:29.109
Um, he says the horse
is gonna be fine but,

14:29.110 --> 14:32.447
he wants to know what
you want to do with it.

14:32.448 --> 14:34.349
<i>What I want to do with it?</i>

14:34.350 --> 14:37.216
Yeah, he can only afford to keep
it there a couple days, and...

14:37.217 --> 14:40.543
He can try to find her a new home but...

14:40.544 --> 14:43.158
Given what that horse
has been through...

14:43.159 --> 14:47.671
She may never be okay
for someone to ride.

14:47.672 --> 14:49.060
I'll handle it.

14:49.061 --> 14:51.461
[Door opens]

14:51.657 --> 14:54.452
How'd the high-school reunion go?

14:54.453 --> 14:56.076
Talked to Travis.

14:56.077 --> 14:59.123
He managed to come up
with the money he owes.

14:59.124 --> 15:00.666
You're welcome.

15:00.667 --> 15:04.447
Victim's name is Titus Griffin.

15:04.862 --> 15:07.732
Ferg, see if you can
track down his next of kin.

15:07.733 --> 15:11.686
Titus Griffin, as in
the Foreman for the farm?

15:11.687 --> 15:15.416
Seems odd that the boss would be in
an illegal rodeo, don't you think?

15:15.417 --> 15:19.443
Maybe Titus tried to put a stop to it.

15:19.444 --> 15:23.796
Beltro will be sending a list of all the
men that worked under Titus at the farm.

15:23.797 --> 15:27.053
Vic, I'm gonna need you and Branch
to head out there and question them.

15:27.054 --> 15:29.218
I seriously doubt that those
guys are gonna talk to us

15:29.219 --> 15:31.993
about an illegal rodeo
where their boss was killed.

15:31.994 --> 15:35.159
We could just go to the rodeo.

15:35.160 --> 15:37.427
Talked to one of my sources.

15:37.428 --> 15:41.628
There's gonna be another one tonight.

15:44.204 --> 15:46.244
[Music]

15:57.366 --> 16:00.366
[Cheers and applause]

16:09.510 --> 16:11.430
Shit.

16:14.228 --> 16:16.448
Vámonos.

16:25.700 --> 16:31.600
See if you can find anyone who
saw or spoke with Titus last night.

16:35.188 --> 16:37.228
[Music]

16:41.276 --> 16:44.276
[Cheers and applause]

16:53.993 --> 16:55.747
I saw your shooting.

16:55.748 --> 16:58.988
That was really impressive,
especially from this distance.

16:58.989 --> 17:01.060
Thank you. Very kind of you to say.

17:01.061 --> 17:03.476
Did you, uh, do that trick last night?

17:03.477 --> 17:05.278
<i>I do the same trick every night.</i>

17:05.279 --> 17:07.652
If you're watching.

17:07.653 --> 17:09.752
[Laughs]

17:10.411 --> 17:13.420
Where did you get your
holster? [Chuckles softly]

17:13.421 --> 17:14.973
Wow.

17:14.973 --> 17:16.574
<i>I am...</i>

17:16.575 --> 17:19.085
<i>Really into leather.</i>

17:19.086 --> 17:22.374
A local man, Javier
Hemendez, made it for me.

17:22.375 --> 17:26.348
You wouldn't happen to, uh,
have his number, by chance?

17:26.348 --> 17:29.579
I may want to get a holster of my own.

17:29.580 --> 17:34.860
I don't have his number,
but I can give you mine.

17:42.491 --> 17:45.491
[Cheers and applause]

18:00.050 --> 18:02.757
<i>- You look like the man in charge.
- What do you want?</i>

18:02.758 --> 18:05.663
I want to know who's
running this operation.

18:05.664 --> 18:08.269
I'm looking to ride.

18:08.270 --> 18:10.169
[Chuckling] Orale!

18:10.170 --> 18:13.501
¿Has oído? Tenemos una celebridad.

18:13.502 --> 18:16.851
Branch Connally for
Sheriff quiere montar!

18:16.852 --> 18:19.072
[Laughter]

18:19.363 --> 18:20.864
We see your signs.

18:20.865 --> 18:23.085
[Laughter]

18:23.497 --> 18:25.297
Oh!

18:25.341 --> 18:27.921
You're famous!

18:30.691 --> 18:32.626
[Groans]

18:32.627 --> 18:35.126
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

18:35.127 --> 18:37.203
Hello, Bob.

18:37.204 --> 18:39.666
Walt. What... what
are you doing out here?

18:39.667 --> 18:41.501
I could ask you the same thing, Bob.

18:41.502 --> 18:44.907
Now, I know this place isn't aboveboard,
but my girlfriend really wanted to come,

18:44.908 --> 18:47.140
and she's hard to say no to, you know?

18:47.141 --> 18:49.559
- Girlfriend?
- Yeah. Her name's Yelena.

18:49.560 --> 18:53.400
Met her at work. She comes in,
cleans the flower shop every week.

18:53.401 --> 18:54.656
[Exhales sharply]

18:54.657 --> 18:55.970
Anyway...

18:55.971 --> 18:58.830
She's friends with a bunch of the
farmers who compete in these events.

18:58.831 --> 19:00.854
She likes to come out and
cheer them on, you know?

19:00.855 --> 19:03.586
Were you here last night?

19:03.587 --> 19:05.942
This gonna get me in trouble?

19:05.943 --> 19:09.171
You see this man last night?

19:09.172 --> 19:14.090
Yeah. Yep, he was here. Be kind
of hard to forget. He shot a guy.

19:14.091 --> 19:15.057
What?

19:15.058 --> 19:17.408
He was doing all these trick
shots, you know, like...

19:17.409 --> 19:21.324
Shooting cigars out of
people's mouths from horseback.

19:21.325 --> 19:23.302
He ended up shooting one of them.

19:23.303 --> 19:25.129
The man he shot, he die?

19:25.130 --> 19:27.874
I don't know. Everybody cleared
out of here pretty quick.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.744
I assumed they sent
him to the rodeo doc.

19:29.745 --> 19:32.703
Oh, Yelena, I want you to meet Walt
Longmire, a very dear friend of mine.

19:32.704 --> 19:35.688
Nice to meet you. We should go Roberto,
they're saying the Sheriff is here.

19:35.689 --> 19:38.157
Oh, you're so sweet when you're worried.

19:38.158 --> 19:39.196
I love you.

19:39.197 --> 19:42.195
Looks like my campaign
advertising is working.

19:42.196 --> 19:44.056
Bob!

19:44.623 --> 19:48.643
Where do I find this rodeo doctor?

19:50.371 --> 19:53.848
Walt: Wyoming State Medical School.

19:53.849 --> 19:57.669
Practicing medicine without a license.

19:57.670 --> 19:59.648
[Sighs]

19:59.649 --> 20:02.392
- That's a felony, Paul.
- Oh, come on.

20:02.393 --> 20:04.162
Look, someone has to
look after those guys,

20:04.163 --> 20:06.746
and no legit doctor is going
anywhere near that rodeo.

20:06.747 --> 20:09.939
I don't see why this is such a big deal.

20:09.940 --> 20:14.571
Man named Titus Griffin was
murdered at that rodeo last night.

20:14.572 --> 20:16.988
That's a pretty big deal.

20:16.989 --> 20:20.188
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:20.189 --> 20:21.836
What does that have to do with me?

20:21.837 --> 20:25.105
He supposedly shot
someone during an event.

20:25.106 --> 20:27.613
- You treat anyone with a gunshot wound?
- Yeah, yeah.

20:27.614 --> 20:30.693
Uh, a Mexican guy... Javier Hemendez.

20:30.694 --> 20:32.593
Did Javier live?

20:32.594 --> 20:35.169
Yeah, he was lucky. Bullet
caught him in the cheek,

20:35.170 --> 20:37.719
passed clear through...
only took out two teeth.

20:37.720 --> 20:40.676
Listen, I wanted to take him
to the hospital, but Titus...

20:40.677 --> 20:43.266
He gave me a wad of cash, he
told me to keep my mouth shut.

20:43.267 --> 20:44.212
Titus paid you?

20:44.213 --> 20:46.891
Yeah, Titus pays everyone. He's
the guy who puts on the rodeo.

20:46.892 --> 20:49.776
Most of the competitors, they
work for him back at the farm.

20:49.777 --> 20:52.545
People pay big money to see
these guys almost kill themselves.

20:52.546 --> 20:55.598
Vic: So, Titus works those guys
hard in the fields all day long,

20:55.599 --> 20:58.004
and then he uses them
in his backwoods rodeo?

20:58.005 --> 21:02.205
Lovely. He sounds like a real Prince.

21:02.558 --> 21:05.508
The man that Titus
shot, Javier Hemendez...

21:05.509 --> 21:07.752
I heard his name before.

21:07.753 --> 21:10.474
A sharpshooter at the
rodeo told me about him.

21:10.475 --> 21:12.982
The shooter had a gun belt
with the same symbol on it.

21:12.983 --> 21:15.941
He said Javier Hemendez made it for him.

21:15.942 --> 21:18.410
So Titus shoots Javier in the face...

21:18.411 --> 21:22.145
Then ends up dead and
tied to Javier's saddle.

21:22.146 --> 21:25.393
I think we ought to find Javier.

21:25.394 --> 21:29.272
He's on the list of workers
that Beltro sent over.

21:29.273 --> 21:31.635
Vic, let's go.

21:31.636 --> 21:33.381
Not you, Branch.

21:33.382 --> 21:37.462
Had enough exposure for one evening.

21:43.436 --> 21:45.356
Yeah.

21:51.177 --> 21:52.842
Hey.

21:52.843 --> 21:55.847
I need to speak with you privately.

21:55.848 --> 22:01.188
Vic, I'll meet you outside.
I'll just be a minute.

22:04.908 --> 22:06.948
[Sighs]

22:08.711 --> 22:12.861
Did you know Detective
Fales was in town?

22:12.862 --> 22:16.251
You sure? You saw him here?

22:16.252 --> 22:20.705
He came into the Red
Pony, asking for me.

22:20.706 --> 22:25.266
He's expecting to
speak with me tomorrow.

22:25.450 --> 22:29.045
I guess we knew this day was coming.

22:29.046 --> 22:31.368
You need a lawyer?

22:31.369 --> 22:35.546
What I need is for you to tell me
everything that you told Detective Fales.

22:35.547 --> 22:41.447
<i>The slightest contradiction in
our stories, and he will notice.</i>

22:48.300 --> 22:49.989
Cal.

22:49.990 --> 22:53.618
Appreciate you coming in from
town. Sorry to get you out of bed.

22:53.619 --> 22:56.134
I heard what happened to Titus.

22:56.135 --> 22:58.076
Why didn't you tell me?

22:58.077 --> 22:59.818
We were still piecing things together.

22:59.819 --> 23:02.153
There's a man works here
we need to talk to...

23:02.154 --> 23:03.791
Javier Hemendez.

23:03.792 --> 23:05.955
Yeah. He lives in the barracks.

23:05.956 --> 23:07.660
You think...

23:07.661 --> 23:09.938
You think Javier might've killed him?

23:09.939 --> 23:11.338
That surprise you?

23:11.339 --> 23:15.962
Come to think of it, he showed up to
work yesterday with a bandage on his face.

23:15.963 --> 23:19.196
I guess nothing should
surprise me from them anymore.

23:19.197 --> 23:22.197
- "Them"?
- Illegals.

23:22.522 --> 23:26.584
Louie, uh, Frier told me that hiring
illegals is against company policy.

23:26.585 --> 23:28.907
I'm sure that's what he told you.

23:28.908 --> 23:31.725
But hiring illegals is
how he makes his money.

23:31.726 --> 23:33.510
Pays them nothing, and
if they don't like it,

23:33.511 --> 23:35.779
what are they gonna do, call the police?

23:35.780 --> 23:37.332
How does Titus feel about all this?

23:37.333 --> 23:38.950
Oh, he knew.

23:38.951 --> 23:42.304
Probably why he pushed
them harder than he should.

23:42.305 --> 23:45.536
Javier's a type of man
who would take revenge?

23:45.537 --> 23:51.437
Push any man too hard, sooner or
later, they're gonna push back.

23:58.804 --> 24:01.854
They were all here when I left.

24:01.855 --> 24:06.715
Couldn't have been more
than three hours ago.

24:07.655 --> 24:11.975
Got any idea where they could've gone?

24:25.354 --> 24:26.775
I thought we said tomorrow.

24:26.776 --> 24:28.016
[Chuckles]

24:28.017 --> 24:30.060
We did.

24:30.061 --> 24:32.387
But I kind of lost track of time.

24:32.388 --> 24:33.604
Easy to do in here.

24:33.605 --> 24:35.652
Can I at least offer
you one on the house?

24:35.653 --> 24:39.061
- You have been very patient.
- No, no. I'm... I'm good.

24:39.062 --> 24:43.521
I actually want to talk to you
about your friend Walt Longmire.

24:43.522 --> 24:49.204
I'm not sure if you know this, but the
man that killed his wife was murdered.

24:49.205 --> 24:52.596
Turns out he was some meth head.

24:52.597 --> 24:55.177
[Clears throat]

24:56.675 --> 24:57.879
<i>I had heard that.</i>

24:57.880 --> 25:01.750
We think we got someone on the hook.

25:01.751 --> 25:02.672
Who?

25:02.673 --> 25:06.075
Not at Liberty to say, and
in [Chuckling] the meantime,

25:06.076 --> 25:10.575
the prosecution's making
me jump through hoops!

25:10.576 --> 25:13.800
They want to make sure the defense...

25:13.801 --> 25:17.994
Can't point to anyone else as a suspect.

25:17.995 --> 25:20.235
Like your friend the Sheriff.

25:20.236 --> 25:21.484
Due diligence.

25:21.485 --> 25:25.240
So I was hoping you could help me out.

25:25.241 --> 25:27.952
I hear you two are close.

25:27.953 --> 25:29.265
What would you like to know?

25:29.266 --> 25:31.965
Walt went to Denver...

25:31.966 --> 25:34.588
A few months after his wife's murder.

25:34.589 --> 25:36.639
Were you aware of that?

25:36.640 --> 25:39.187
It was around June, if I'm not mistaken.

25:39.188 --> 25:41.924
Since we're on the subject.

25:41.925 --> 25:46.414
<i>Would you mind telling
me why you were in Denver?</i>

25:46.415 --> 25:49.895
Gas-station receipts show...

25:49.909 --> 25:55.609
You were there the same
weekend, then again a week later.

25:56.284 --> 25:59.644
I went to help a friend.

26:12.105 --> 26:14.089
<i>Which friend?</i>

26:14.090 --> 26:16.206
Ada Black Kettle.

26:16.207 --> 26:21.842
She's 80, lives alone. I try
to check in on her when I can.

26:21.843 --> 26:26.220
Did you see Walt when
you were in Denver?

26:26.221 --> 26:28.117
I did.

26:28.118 --> 26:30.256
He was there following
up on his wife's case,

26:30.257 --> 26:34.855
making sure the Denver
P.D. was doing its job.

26:34.856 --> 26:37.761
Well, I'm sorry I wasn't assigned,

26:37.762 --> 26:41.422
to her case back then, but...

26:41.549 --> 26:43.288
I'm here now.

26:43.289 --> 26:47.923
Once a case is in my head,
I just can't let it go.

26:47.924 --> 26:52.184
My ex-wife used to call me obsessive.

26:53.122 --> 26:54.963
You sure you do not want a beer?

26:54.964 --> 26:56.764
No.

26:56.872 --> 27:01.132
You look like you've had a long day.

27:01.176 --> 27:04.836
Why don't you have that one?

27:07.951 --> 27:11.505
Henry, it's me. Give me a
call back when you get this.

27:11.506 --> 27:14.792
Hey, Walt. You wanted to see me?

27:14.793 --> 27:17.367
Yeah. Uh, take a seat.

27:17.368 --> 27:21.664
You mentioned your girlfriend knew
some of the competitors from the rodeo.

27:21.665 --> 27:24.161
All those men have disappeared
from the farm where they work.

27:24.162 --> 27:26.066
You think Yelena might
know where they went?

27:29.585 --> 27:32.501
We got a good thing going.

27:32.502 --> 27:34.558
Feel kind of weird asking
her something like that,

27:34.559 --> 27:37.558
especially when it's gonna
get her friends in trouble.

27:37.559 --> 27:42.121
Bob, I don't really care if these men are
here illegally. That's a federal matter.

27:42.122 --> 27:46.527
I'm just trying to solve a murder case.

27:46.528 --> 27:49.113
That company Yelena's friends work for,

27:49.114 --> 27:52.239
is bound to notice half their
workers missing, and when they do,

27:52.240 --> 27:55.268
they can call immigration
and have them deported.

27:55.269 --> 28:00.823
If you help me find them first, I might
be able to stop that from happening.

28:00.824 --> 28:04.275
I imagine that would make
Yelena pretty grateful.

28:04.276 --> 28:06.846
You really think she'll see it that way?

28:06.847 --> 28:07.798
[Knock on door]

28:07.799 --> 28:10.230

28:10.231 --> 28:12.691
Uh, can I...

28:13.854 --> 28:17.094
Women love a hero, Bob.

28:19.341 --> 28:20.690
The bank just called.

28:20.691 --> 28:25.420
They want to know why we haven't taken
possession of Travis Murphy's trailer yet.

28:25.421 --> 28:27.245
He hasn't made his payment.

28:27.246 --> 28:28.627
Travis? That can't be.

28:28.628 --> 28:31.547
Man will say or do just about
anything to keep his home.

28:31.548 --> 28:34.168
Can't cut corners in this job
just because someone's a friend.

28:34.169 --> 28:37.163
I was just trying to give
somebody the benefit of the doubt.

28:37.164 --> 28:38.794
Won't happen again.

28:38.795 --> 28:39.994
Take the damn trailer.

28:39.995 --> 28:43.421
No. You want to be Sheriff, you do it.

28:43.422 --> 28:45.656
- Vic.
- What? What did I do?

28:45.657 --> 28:50.097
Go with him. Make sure he gets it done.

28:52.479 --> 28:56.747
Managed to sweet-talk her. Here you go.

28:56.748 --> 28:58.616
Ferg. With me.

28:58.617 --> 29:01.017
Thanks, Bob.

with a bandage on his cheek...

29:15.468 --> 29:18.708
Fair bet that's Javier.

29:21.052 --> 29:24.553
Ferg: I see him. So, what's the plan?

29:24.554 --> 29:30.454
I never thought I'd say this, but I
think I got to be more like Branch.

30:14.524 --> 30:18.944
Titus Griffin was shot two nights ago and
tied to a saddle with the same insignia.

30:18.945 --> 30:22.114
I understand he shot you
in the face that same night.

30:22.115 --> 30:24.283
Did you return the favor?

30:24.284 --> 30:28.235
No, no, no, no. This was an accident.

30:28.236 --> 30:31.555
We do it lots of times
before, nothing happened.

30:31.556 --> 30:34.465
I did not kill him.

30:34.466 --> 30:36.654
Why run away from Beltro Farm, then?

30:36.655 --> 30:38.752
Well, I did not run.

30:38.753 --> 30:42.320
A man come to the farm, tell us to go.

30:42.321 --> 30:44.392
But we cannot leave Wyoming.

30:44.393 --> 30:45.603
Why?

30:45.604 --> 30:47.252
Beltro...

30:47.253 --> 30:51.883
They tell us we can come
here with our families...

30:51.884 --> 30:54.284
From Mexico.

30:54.296 --> 30:58.376
They promise us a house and papers.

30:58.682 --> 31:03.602
But when we get here,
they give us no papers.

31:05.080 --> 31:08.980
Beltro tell us we have to pay...

31:09.627 --> 31:12.051

31:12.052 --> 31:13.386
For the food.

31:13.387 --> 31:15.425
Why not just run away?

31:15.426 --> 31:18.937
They split our... our families up.

31:18.938 --> 31:22.046
They send them to work on other farms.

31:22.047 --> 31:26.097
They tell us if we
don't do as they say...

31:26.098 --> 31:28.963
We will never see them again.

31:28.964 --> 31:30.533
No one help us.

31:30.534 --> 31:32.874
Only Titus.

31:35.120 --> 31:38.122
Titus didn't seem like
the kind of man would help.

31:38.123 --> 31:40.787
Everything we heard,
he wasn't a good man.

31:40.788 --> 31:43.066
No. You are wrong.

31:43.067 --> 31:44.599
He was our friend.

31:44.600 --> 31:48.075
He bought a saddle from
me so I can make money.

31:48.076 --> 31:52.966
All the money from his rodeo,
he gave to us to pay our debts.

31:52.967 --> 31:57.407
He promised even to turn the company in.

31:58.076 --> 32:01.341
You saying Titus was building
a case against Beltro?

32:01.342 --> 32:03.914
We tell him no.

32:03.915 --> 32:06.064

32:06.065 --> 32:08.885
They are bad men.

Before you do anything,
just give me a chance...

I need you to come
down off those steps.

32:27.913 --> 32:30.718
- You ain't even gonna hear me out?
- Just to have you lie to me again?

32:30.719 --> 32:32.525
- Branch, listen.
- No, thanks.

Branch, that's my home.

in the investigation?

I'm afraid your company's got
a big problem on its hands.

33:40.414 --> 33:43.868
Seems a fair number of the workers
from Titus' farm have gone missing.

33:43.869 --> 33:47.633

them, and they cleared out.

And, uh, they had some
interesting things to tell me.

33:59.262 --> 34:02.986
Particularly how Beltro
trafficked them to The States.

34:02.987 --> 34:05.759
Tore their families apart, and...

34:05.760 --> 34:08.027
Forced them into indentured servitude.

34:09.600 --> 34:12.388
That's some accusation.

34:12.389 --> 34:14.974
Of course, consider the source.

34:14.975 --> 34:16.597
What's more interesting to me, though,

34:16.598 --> 34:21.040
is that none of those men
had a reason to kill Titus.

34:21.041 --> 34:23.690
Turns out he's a big advocate for them.

34:23.692 --> 34:29.134

to help supplement their wages.

something to do with his death?

to make a company bad.

40:55.164 --> 41:01.044
The first warrior looked out
on the land that was his home.

41:01.783 --> 41:04.723
He saw the hills...

41:04.846 --> 41:07.426
And the stars.

41:08.565 --> 41:11.385
And he was happy.

41:12.992 --> 41:14.911
For giving him this home,

41:14.912 --> 41:16.949
the first warrior told
the great spirit that he

41:16.950 --> 41:21.870
would fight and win many
battles in his honor.

41:25.914 --> 41:28.674
Time to go home.

41:30.661 --> 41:33.923
But the great spirit said, "no".

41:33.924 --> 41:37.102
"Do not fight for me".

41:37.103 --> 41:40.283
"Fight for your tribe".

41:40.475 --> 41:44.555
"Fight for the family born to you".

41:45.719 --> 41:49.679
"Fight for the brothers you find".

42:03.454 --> 42:07.834
"Fight for them," the great spirit said.

42:08.442 --> 42:11.802
"For they are your home".

42:13.073 --> 42:15.113
