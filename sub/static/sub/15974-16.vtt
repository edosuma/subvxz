Is it me, or is this
an incredibly slow news day?

02:32:43.460 --> 02:32:45.690
It's very slow.

02:32:45.762 --> 02:32:47.856
It's excruciatingly slow.

Yet here we are.

the games to start.

What time does the first

In seven hours.

I don't have
a favorite shirt.

02:33:16.927 --> 02:33:19.259
-- The white J. Press. --
That's not my favorite shirt.

02:33:19.329 --> 02:33:21.491
The white J. Press

-- How did you lose it?

02:33:28.705 --> 02:33:30.571
-- I didn't lose it. -- Then how
come you can't you find it?

02:33:30.640 --> 02:33:32.540

02:33:47.624 --> 02:33:48.887
You went to
a woman's apartment,

02:33:48.959 --> 02:33:50.723
and there you had wine,
and there you had sex.

So here's the thing.</i>

02:34:04.374 --> 02:34:07.400
Natalie's invited me to spend Easter
at her parents' house in Ohio.

02:34:07.477 --> 02:34:10.003
It would be three days and two
nights that would include

02:34:10.080 --> 02:34:13.448
various family and holiday-oriented events
such as dinners and trips to church.

02:34:13.517 --> 02:34:15.076
Now...I'm Jewish.

02:34:15.152 --> 02:34:16.085
No kidding?

02:34:16.153 --> 02:34:17.985
Right...
and I need some guidance

02:34:18.055 --> 02:34:20.854
'cause I don't mind telling you, I'm
feeling just a little anxious about this.

02:34:20.924 --> 02:34:23.256
Number one -- is it too
early in our relationship

02:34:23.326 --> 02:34:25.317
for me to be spending
three days at her parents'?

02:34:25.395 --> 02:34:28.456
I mean, it's not like I'm
Pacino going back to Corleone

02:34:28.532 --> 02:34:30.899
and bringing gifts to
Appolonia's family.

02:34:30.967 --> 02:34:32.833
And number two --
I'm Jewish.

02:34:33.804 --> 02:34:35.863
<i>And her family is, you know,
incredibly not.</i>

02:34:35.939 --> 02:34:38.340
Which isn't, by the way,
any sort of a problem for me,

02:34:38.408 --> 02:34:40.467
but I do think it might be
a problem for them,

02:34:40.544 --> 02:34:44.105
because, after all, there are those who
think I killed their lord, Jesus Christ.

02:34:44.181 --> 02:34:47.674
<i>Not me directly, mind you. I didn't
drive the getaway car or anything.</i>

02:34:47.751 --> 02:34:51.051
In fact, my family's from Latvia,
so we've got a pretty solid alibi,

02:34:51.121 --> 02:34:52.953
but anyway, Isaac,
what do you think?

02:34:53.023 --> 02:34:57.358
-- Oh, my God, were you talking to me all
that time? -- You want me to start again?

02:34:57.427 --> 02:35:00.590
Yeah, but first, could you just hit me over the
head with that blunt instrument over there?

02:35:00.664 --> 02:35:03.031
Jeremy, is there
any news to report?

02:35:03.100 --> 02:35:03.896
On what?

02:35:03.967 --> 02:35:04.934
On the news.

any news to report?

I gotta tell you,
there really isn't.

of work to do.

about it later?

every/body's personal problems.

-- Just a little.
-- It's an office, after all.

02:35:23.019 --> 02:35:24.043
That's right.

02:35:24.121 --> 02:35:25.782
You're our boss,
not our bartender.

02:35:25.856 --> 02:35:27.756
We shouldn't be leaning
on you like this.

02:35:27.824 --> 02:35:29.724
Just so long as we're
professional.

I'm surprised I could
muster up that much.

late show at Rainbow and Stars,

which he loves.

a pet fish that died.

02:35:53.016 --> 02:35:54.780
And what does that have to do
with Gordon standing me up?

02:35:54.851 --> 02:35:56.842

you were finished.

For many reasons, I suppose,
not the least of which

02:39:11.548 --> 02:39:13.175
[Dialing]

02:39:13.249 --> 02:39:16.708
[Slurping]

02:39:16.786 --> 02:39:18.880
How exactly did the shirt
get left behind?

02:39:18.955 --> 02:39:20.616
We don't really have to
talk about this, do we?

02:39:20.690 --> 02:39:21.657
-- I think we do.
-- Yeah?

02:39:21.725 --> 02:39:23.284
-- I think it's good for you.
-- Thanks.

02:39:23.360 --> 02:39:25.852
-- How did the shirt get left behind?
-- I spilled wine.

02:39:25.929 --> 02:39:28.557
-- She offered to throw it in the laundry.
-- <i>I</i> told her not <i>to go to</i> any trouble.

02:39:28.631 --> 02:39:30.622
-- “Oh, it's no trouble.“ -- But
then morning comes around --

02:39:30.700 --> 02:39:32.725
And you don't feel like sticking around
for the shirt to get out of the drier.

02:39:32.802 --> 02:39:34.270
So I put my jacket on
over my T-shirt...

02:39:34.337 --> 02:39:36.135
-- <i>Slink</i> on <i>home.</i>
-- <i>I didn't slink.</i>

02:39:36.206 --> 02:39:38.197
-- <i>What time was it?</i>
-- <i>It was about 6:00 A.M.</i>

02:39:38.274 --> 02:39:39.799
-- It was just getting light outside?
-- Yeah.

02:39:39.876 --> 02:39:41.310
-- <i>Jacket over the T-shirt?</i>
-- <i>Like I said.</i>

02:39:41.378 --> 02:39:43.073
-- <i>You slinked.</i>
-- <i>Danny...</i>

02:39:43.146 --> 02:39:44.614
You slinked, my young friend.

02:39:44.681 --> 02:39:47.116
And I've never felt closer
to you in my entire life.

02:39:47.183 --> 02:39:49.709
<i>Dana: I'll tell you
why I-l called,</i>

02:39:49.786 --> 02:39:52.653
and this is gonna
sound silly.

02:39:52.722 --> 02:39:54.451
Abort, Dana.

02:39:56.192 --> 02:39:58.957
There was no reason
for this call.

02:39:59.028 --> 02:39:59.961
[Laughs]

02:40:00.029 --> 02:40:02.088
There was absolutely
no reason.

02:40:02.165 --> 02:40:05.533
This is a call in the middle
of the day to say hello...

02:40:05.602 --> 02:40:08.435
[Chuckles] 'cause
that's the cut of my jib.

02:40:08.505 --> 02:40:09.995
Would you please?

02:40:12.041 --> 02:40:15.067
That would be great.

02:40:15.145 --> 02:40:18.945
That would be...
really good.

02:40:19.015 --> 02:40:20.608
[Whispering]
This is really good.

02:40:21.718 --> 02:40:23.618
That's really good.

02:40:23.686 --> 02:40:27.054
Well...mm-hmm.
I'll see you later.

02:40:27.123 --> 02:40:28.147
[Chuckles] Goodbye.

02:40:28.224 --> 02:40:29.123
[Receiver hangs up]

02:40:29.192 --> 02:40:31.661
He's coming by tonight
for the show,

02:40:31.728 --> 02:40:33.287
then we're gonna go out.

02:40:33.363 --> 02:40:36.355
The tone in his voice --
uh! -- his tone of voice --

02:40:36.433 --> 02:40:38.231
it was all I needed to hear.

02:40:38.301 --> 02:40:39.860
I could tell right away.

02:40:39.936 --> 02:40:41.461
-- I'm glad.
-- [Laughing]

02:40:41.538 --> 02:40:42.869
You see
what I'm talking about?

02:40:42.939 --> 02:40:44.031
-- Communication...
-- Yes.

02:40:44.107 --> 02:40:45.336
-- Between two people.
-- Yes.

02:40:45.408 --> 02:40:47.467
"The cut of my jib" --
I've never said that before.

02:40:47.544 --> 02:40:49.478
-- It sounded good.
-- [ Chuckling]

02:40:49.546 --> 02:40:51.173
Jeremy's still at it
with the eggnog?

02:40:51.247 --> 02:40:53.011
He badly wants to be
accepted by my parents.

02:40:53.082 --> 02:40:54.607
-- Yes. -- Come to
think of it, so do I.

02:40:54.684 --> 02:40:55.674
Sure.

02:40:55.752 --> 02:40:57.914
Look, an editing machine --
we can work.

02:40:57.987 --> 02:40:59.216
His tone of voice --

02:40:59.289 --> 02:41:01.223
You guys will have
a great time tonight.

02:41:01.291 --> 02:41:03.055
Things are very good
right now.

02:41:03.126 --> 02:41:04.287
That's right.

02:41:04.360 --> 02:41:06.829
I was feeling strange, and now
I'm not feeling strange anymore.

02:41:06.896 --> 02:41:08.091
Good. North Carolina.

02:41:08.164 --> 02:41:09.325
I still feel strange.

02:41:09.399 --> 02:41:11.493
-- I know.
-- Why do I feel strange?

02:41:11.568 --> 02:41:13.798
-- I have a theory. -- You
have a theory <i>about this?</i>

02:41:13.870 --> 02:41:15.235
I have a theory about why
you're feeling strange.

02:41:15.305 --> 02:41:17.364
I know you do,
but I choose not to hear it.

02:41:17.440 --> 02:41:18.566
Well, life's not quite
like that, is it, though?

02:41:18.641 --> 02:41:20.473
-- No, it's not.
-- Here's my theory --

02:41:20.543 --> 02:41:22.068
-- Yes?
-- You don't like Gordon.

02:41:22.145 --> 02:41:24.739
VVell, that's an interesting theory,
and you'd be completely right

02:41:24.814 --> 02:41:26.646
except for the fact
that you're totally wrong.

02:41:26.716 --> 02:41:27.740
Dana...

02:41:27.817 --> 02:41:29.012
Natalie...

02:41:29.085 --> 02:41:30.985
This is you and me talking,
Dana. I'm not other people.

02:41:31.054 --> 02:41:32.317
This is our little
coven of women.

02:41:32.388 --> 02:41:34.254
"Coven" is
a group of witches.

02:41:34.324 --> 02:41:36.793
I thought a coven
was just a group.

02:41:36.860 --> 02:41:38.487
It's a group of witches.

02:41:38.561 --> 02:41:40.393
All right, then this is
our little something else.

02:41:40.463 --> 02:41:42.397
And also because a coven
is more than two.

02:41:42.465 --> 02:41:43.591
-- A coven is more than two?
-- Yes.

02:41:43.666 --> 02:41:44.997
-- Are you sure?
-- Yes.

02:41:45.068 --> 02:41:45.864
-- Are you absolutely sure?
-- Yes.

02:41:45.935 --> 02:41:47.835
Then, thank you,
William Safire.

02:41:47.904 --> 02:41:49.702
I'm just saying, if you're
gonna misuse a word,

02:41:49.772 --> 02:41:51.672
-- you should do it properly.
-- You don't like Gordon.

02:41:51.741 --> 02:41:52.867
Listen, that's not true.

02:41:52.942 --> 02:41:54.432
<i>It is true,
and you happen to be</i>

02:41:54.511 --> 02:41:55.979
the only one
who doesn't know it.

02:41:56.045 --> 02:41:57.103
I like Gordon a lot.

02:41:57.180 --> 02:41:58.909
I love Gordon.
I'm telling you --

02:41:58.982 --> 02:42:02.145
And I'm telling you that when you use
that word in a romantic context,

02:42:02.218 --> 02:42:04.744
you have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

02:42:06.689 --> 02:42:09.056
Well, now...

02:42:09.125 --> 02:42:11.355
[Sighs]

02:42:11.427 --> 02:42:14.556
The box-and-one.

02:42:14.631 --> 02:42:17.566
[Sighs]

02:42:17.634 --> 02:42:19.898
That was a lousy thing
to say about Gordon.

02:42:19.969 --> 02:42:22.700
I didn't say it about Gordon.
I said it about you.

02:42:22.772 --> 02:42:23.796
Let's work.

02:42:23.873 --> 02:42:25.898
That'd be fine.

02:42:26.809 --> 02:42:29.073
[Sighs]

02:42:30.780 --> 02:42:32.214
I'm calling him again.

02:42:32.282 --> 02:42:33.909
To hear his tone of voice?

02:42:33.983 --> 02:42:36.247
-- That's right.
-- Imagine my surprise.

02:42:36.319 --> 02:42:37.753
I'd like some privacy.

02:42:37.820 --> 02:42:39.413
-- I'll go get some Fritos.
-- Thank you.

02:42:39.489 --> 02:42:41.287
-- Would you like any Fritos?
-- No, I'm fine.

02:42:41.357 --> 02:42:42.449
I'll be the judge of that.

02:42:42.525 --> 02:42:43.720
Apparently you will be.

02:42:43.793 --> 02:42:45.192
This is one of those moments

02:42:45.261 --> 02:42:46.922
I'm compelled to tell you
how wonderful you are.

02:42:46.996 --> 02:42:48.862
Every once in a while,
I'm reminded

02:42:48.932 --> 02:42:51.424
how lucky I am to be dating
a solid, mature man.

02:42:54.737 --> 02:42:57.502
Jeremy, swallow the eggnog.

02:42:57.574 --> 02:42:59.668
I just can't.

02:43:06.115 --> 02:43:08.209
Anybody remember Salanio
and Salerio?

02:43:08.284 --> 02:43:09.445
-- Yes.
-- Chris?

02:43:09.519 --> 02:43:10.611
Salanio and Salerio?

02:43:10.687 --> 02:43:13.156
-- From “The Merchant
of Venice.“ -- Yes.

02:43:13.222 --> 02:43:15.213
-- "Yes" you remember them?
-- Yes.

02:43:15.291 --> 02:43:16.588
-- Elliott?
-- What?

02:43:16.659 --> 02:43:19.890
She wants to know
if you remember them.

02:43:19.963 --> 02:43:21.294
I don't believe I do.

02:43:21.364 --> 02:43:22.661
<i>They brought news</i> --

02:43:22.732 --> 02:43:24.427
news of Antonio and his ship

02:43:24.500 --> 02:43:27.299
and the state of
Shylock's loan to Bassanio.

02:43:27.370 --> 02:43:30.169
They helped to keep
the audience up to date.

02:43:30.239 --> 02:43:33.732
The Ventfcefli, they were
called -- the little winds.

02:43:33.810 --> 02:43:37.940
Man, this is about as bored
as I have ever been in my life.

02:43:38.014 --> 02:43:40.278
Jeremy, good Jeremy,
what ho?

02:43:40.350 --> 02:43:42.114
-- "What ho?"
-- What news, Jeremy?

02:43:42.185 --> 02:43:44.483
Why is she
speaking like this?

02:43:44.554 --> 02:43:46.079
She thinks she's
Sacco and Vanzetti.

02:43:46.155 --> 02:43:47.850
Salanio and Salerio.

02:43:47.924 --> 02:43:49.358
The little winds.

02:43:49.425 --> 02:43:50.915
-- <i>The Venticelli.
Yes.</i>

02:43:50.994 --> 02:43:54.931
All right...well, Dana's having
second thoughts about Gordon.

02:43:54.998 --> 02:43:59.128
Dana thinks it's because Gordon stood her up
last night under suspicious circumstances,

02:43:59.202 --> 02:44:01.603
but Natalie thinks it's because
Dana really likes Casey.

02:44:01.671 --> 02:44:05.437
Casey's a little out of sorts because sometime
last week, he spent the night with someone.

02:44:05.508 --> 02:44:08.569
Casey thinks it's because it was too
soon after his marriage broke up,

02:44:08.645 --> 02:44:10.443
but Dan thinks it's because
Casey's in love with Dana.

02:44:10.513 --> 02:44:11.981
That's pretty much it.

02:44:12.048 --> 02:44:15.484
VVould it be wrong for you guys
just to make up a news story?

02:44:15.551 --> 02:44:17.178
It would be
fundamentally wrong.

02:44:17.253 --> 02:44:20.188
Can any of you tell me anything
about the host wafer?

02:44:21.958 --> 02:44:23.084
[Rattles]

02:44:23.159 --> 02:44:26.026
-- So you made her breakfast?
-- No.

02:44:26.095 --> 02:44:27.927
-- You didn't make her breakfast?
-- fjust left.

02:44:27.997 --> 02:44:29.624
-- <i>'Cause you were uncomfortable.</i>
-- Yeah.

02:44:29.699 --> 02:44:30.791
-- Something wasn't right.
-- <i>Yes.</i>

02:44:30.867 --> 02:44:32.028
You could have fried
her an egg, dude.

02:44:32.101 --> 02:44:33.626
Danny...

02:44:33.703 --> 02:44:36.297
Haven't you noticed there's a
question I haven't asked you yet?

02:44:36.372 --> 02:44:38.033
Yes.

02:44:38.107 --> 02:44:39.302
I haven't asked you
who it was.

02:44:39.375 --> 02:44:40.570
No, you haven't.

02:44:40.643 --> 02:44:41.906
I haven't asked you her name.

02:44:41.978 --> 02:44:43.173
I appreciate it.

02:44:43.246 --> 02:44:44.475
Do you know why
I haven't asked?

02:44:44.547 --> 02:44:46.515
It was, like, a week ago, Danny.
Uh, can we drop it?

02:44:46.582 --> 02:44:48.744
I haven't asked, because
that's not what men do.

02:44:48.818 --> 02:44:50.343
-- And it's really not.
-- We <i>don't ask.</i>

02:44:50.420 --> 02:44:53.014
We don't tell. We don't do a lot
of things that women think we do.

02:44:53.089 --> 02:44:55.319
-- That's what makes us men.
-- Was it Victoria?

02:44:55.391 --> 02:44:57.325
-- Who's Victoria?
-- From your building.

02:44:57.393 --> 02:44:59.054
-- That's Leslie.
-- Was it Leslie?

02:44:59.128 --> 02:45:01.654
I'm not gonna
tell you her name.

02:45:01.731 --> 02:45:05.929
We can do this the hard way,
or we can do this the easy way.

02:45:06.002 --> 02:45:07.231
What's the hard way?

02:45:07.303 --> 02:45:09.601
I don't know, but the easy way
is you telling me her name.

02:45:09.672 --> 02:45:10.605
<i>Danny...</i>

02:45:10.673 --> 02:45:12.368
-- What's the big deal?
-- It's not a big deal.

02:45:12.442 --> 02:45:14.206
That's why I'm not
gonna tell you her name.

02:45:14.277 --> 02:45:16.541
Just whisper it in my ear,
come on.

02:45:16.612 --> 02:45:18.410
Oh, you know <i>that's</i>
not gonna happen.

02:45:18.481 --> 02:45:20.882
If it's easier, you could write
it down on a piece of paper.

02:45:20.950 --> 02:45:22.440
Why would that be easier?

02:45:22.518 --> 02:45:24.646
Maybe the name's
difficult to pronounce.

02:45:24.721 --> 02:45:26.746
The name's not difficult
to pronounce.

02:45:26.823 --> 02:45:28.951
Now we're getting somewhere.

02:45:29.025 --> 02:45:29.958
Can I ask you a question?

02:45:30.026 --> 02:45:31.016
Is it about
the box-and-one?

02:45:31.094 --> 02:45:32.061
-- Yes.
-- Sure.

02:45:32.128 --> 02:45:33.562
Do you think Casey's
been seeing Sally?

02:45:33.629 --> 02:45:35.256
-- No.
-- You don't?

02:45:35.331 --> 02:45:36.856
-- No. -- You don't think
he's been seeing Sally?

02:45:36.933 --> 02:45:38.025
-- No.
-- Just like that?

02:45:38.101 --> 02:45:39.466
What do you mean?

02:45:39.535 --> 02:45:41.469
I mean it seems like you didn't
have to think about it at all.

02:45:41.537 --> 02:45:43.062
-- You didn't have to consider it.
-- I didn't.

02:45:43.139 --> 02:45:44.766
-- Why not? -- 'Cause I
know he's not seeing Sally.

02:45:44.841 --> 02:45:45.808
How do you know?

02:45:45.875 --> 02:45:46.967
'Cause if he was, I'd know.

02:45:47.043 --> 02:45:49.512
-- That's what I thought, too.
-- Yeah.

02:45:49.579 --> 02:45:50.944
I thought if he was,
I'd know.

02:45:51.013 --> 02:45:53.448
But then I thought,
Casey's very discreet.

02:45:53.516 --> 02:45:54.745
He's extremely discreet.

02:45:54.817 --> 02:45:56.808
Discretion is very
big with Casey.

02:45:56.886 --> 02:46:00.618
Very big. And then I also thought,
why wouldn't he be seeing Sally?

02:46:00.690 --> 02:46:02.852
Sally is maybe
the best-looking woman --

02:46:02.925 --> 02:46:04.552
I don't know -- in the world.

02:46:04.627 --> 02:46:07.426
He's just gotten done with
a 10-year marriage to --

02:46:07.497 --> 02:46:09.431
now, don't get me wrong,
'cause she's an old friend --

02:46:09.499 --> 02:46:10.989
a pretty hideous Wench.

02:46:11.067 --> 02:46:14.162
Wouldn't you be seeing Sally?
I'd be seeing Sally.

02:46:14.237 --> 02:46:15.727
He's not seeing Sally.

02:46:15.805 --> 02:46:17.967
Sally's body is ridiculous.

02:46:18.040 --> 02:46:19.769
You have a very
good body, Dana.

02:46:19.842 --> 02:46:20.968
-- <i>Bet your ass</i> I <i>do.</i>
-- <i>That's right.</i>

02:46:21.043 --> 02:46:21.976
And you do, too.

02:46:22.044 --> 02:46:23.170
Tell me about it.

02:46:23.246 --> 02:46:25.237
But that woman's body
is over the line.

02:46:25.314 --> 02:46:26.247
He's not seeing Sally.

02:46:26.315 --> 02:46:28.181
Then he's out of his mind.

02:46:28.251 --> 02:46:29.275
You really like my body?

02:46:29.352 --> 02:46:30.717
She'd be receptive
to his advances.

02:46:30.787 --> 02:46:31.811
She's made that quite known.

02:46:31.888 --> 02:46:33.413
I'll grant you that.

02:46:33.489 --> 02:46:35.651
She is "Sally the willing."

02:46:35.725 --> 02:46:38.353
You know how I know
Casey isn't seeing Sally?

02:46:38.427 --> 02:46:39.690
HOW?

02:46:39.762 --> 02:46:41.287
Because he really
cares about you.

02:46:41.364 --> 02:46:43.196
And he knows it would
hurt your feelings.

02:46:48.938 --> 02:46:51.270
<i>Dan: I, for example, have had,
from time to time,</i>

02:46:51.340 --> 02:46:53.308
trouble pronouncing
the name "Moira."

02:46:53.376 --> 02:46:55.242
<i>Also, we know someone
named "Kirsten,"</i>

02:46:55.311 --> 02:46:57.143
and some people pronounce
it "Keersten."

02:46:57.213 --> 02:46:58.647
It's not Kirsten.
It's not Moira.

02:46:58.714 --> 02:47:01.046
-- Jane's an easy name to pronounce.
-- It's not Jane.

02:47:01.117 --> 02:47:02.607
-- <i>80's Pam.</i>
-- <i>You know what?</i>

02:47:02.685 --> 02:47:05.177
I have an idea. Let's talk
about this a lot more.

02:47:05.254 --> 02:47:07.018
I have literally
nothing to do.

02:47:07.089 --> 02:47:08.853
Get a score on
Michigan/Michigan State.

02:47:08.925 --> 02:47:10.017
84-66, Michigan.

02:47:10.092 --> 02:47:11.150
Look at that.

02:47:11.227 --> 02:47:12.160
Hey, Sally.

02:47:12.228 --> 02:47:13.696
Sally had the score.

02:47:13.763 --> 02:47:14.992
What's going on?

02:47:15.064 --> 02:47:16.361
Oh, virtually nothing.

02:47:16.432 --> 02:47:17.763
Sally was right there
with the score.

02:47:17.834 --> 02:47:19.495
You got a problem
with me today, Dan?

02:47:19.569 --> 02:47:20.764
You're 19 feet tall.

02:47:20.837 --> 02:47:22.566
Why are you wearing heels?

02:47:22.638 --> 02:47:24.572
Are you feeling diminutive?

02:47:24.640 --> 02:47:27.132
No...but now I have
to look up that word.

02:47:29.512 --> 02:47:31.207
-- Casey... [Clears
throat] -- Yeah?

02:47:31.280 --> 02:47:32.907
-- I, um, can't find it.
-- You can't find it?

02:47:32.982 --> 02:47:33.915
-- The thing.
-- Yeah.

02:47:33.983 --> 02:47:35.382
You know what
I'm talking about?

02:47:35.451 --> 02:47:37.044
-- Yeah.
-- Can't find it anywhere.

02:47:37.119 --> 02:47:39.019
-- It's okay.
-- I'll keep looking.

02:47:39.088 --> 02:47:40.556
You know, if --
if it turns up.

02:47:40.623 --> 02:47:43.615
Maybe it got mixed up
with someone else's laundry.

02:47:43.693 --> 02:47:45.092
Yeah, it's no big deal.

02:47:45.161 --> 02:47:46.651
Maybe I'll see you later.

02:47:46.729 --> 02:47:48.629
I'll be here or on the air.

02:47:48.698 --> 02:47:50.257
I'll be here or there.

02:47:50.333 --> 02:47:52.734
-- I know.
-- Yeah, of course.

02:47:52.802 --> 02:47:54.429
Have a good show.

02:48:02.912 --> 02:48:05.381
Okay, you only think you know
what she was talking about.

02:48:05.448 --> 02:48:07.712
I have a hunch I cracked
her code, yes.

02:48:07.783 --> 02:48:10.582
She was talking about a pair of
cross-country skis that she borrowed.

02:48:10.653 --> 02:48:12.178
That may have gotten mixed up
in the laundry.

02:48:12.255 --> 02:48:13.916
Yes.

02:48:13.990 --> 02:48:15.754
While I applaud
your initiative,

02:48:15.825 --> 02:48:17.953
while I like that
you're moving forward,

02:48:18.027 --> 02:48:20.655
and while I admire your having
climbed Mt. Sally --

02:48:20.730 --> 02:48:21.663
Danny...

02:48:21.731 --> 02:48:23.358
This is a recipe
for disaster.

02:48:23.432 --> 02:48:25.025
-- It's no big deal.
-- Moreover...

02:48:25.101 --> 02:48:26.933
-- What?
-- You shouldn't tell Dana.

02:48:27.003 --> 02:48:29.097
Well, of course I'm not
gonna tell Dana.

02:48:29.171 --> 02:48:30.468
I mean, Dana
shouldn't find out.

02:48:30.539 --> 02:48:31.597
-- I know.
-- Do you?

02:48:31.674 --> 02:48:33.335
Yes.

02:48:38.547 --> 02:48:40.447
What is it, Jeremy?

02:48:40.516 --> 02:48:42.484
Interesting thing --

02:48:42.551 --> 02:48:44.610
did you know that the word “Easter“
never appears in the Bible?

02:48:44.687 --> 02:48:46.621
-- <i>Is that right?</i>
-- <i>The Bible is absent</i>

02:48:46.689 --> 02:48:49.522
any mention of a celebration
of the Resurrection of Christ,

02:48:49.592 --> 02:48:50.957
save for one verse --

02:48:51.027 --> 02:48:53.428
Acts 12, Verse 4, and that's
only in the King James Bible,

02:48:53.496 --> 02:48:56.124
where the word "Passover"
was mistranslated as Easter.

02:48:56.198 --> 02:48:58.895
However, in the new King
James, the American standard,

02:48:58.968 --> 02:49:00.834
and even the new
international version,

02:49:00.903 --> 02:49:03.099
the word is translated
correctly as "Passover."

02:49:03.172 --> 02:49:04.640
Now, that's a relief.

02:49:04.707 --> 02:49:06.004
I did a search on the word
"Resurrection."

02:49:06.075 --> 02:49:07.338
-- Excellent.
-- Want to hear more?

02:49:07.410 --> 02:49:08.468
-- Not at all.
-- Can <i>I ask</i> a question?

02:49:08.544 --> 02:49:09.568
Sure.

02:49:09.645 --> 02:49:12.239
Jesus said, "Behold
my hands and my feet,

02:49:12.315 --> 02:49:13.805
"that it is myself.

02:49:13.883 --> 02:49:17.945
"Handle me and see, for a spirit
hath not flesh and bones,

02:49:18.020 --> 02:49:19.419
as ye see me have."

02:49:19.488 --> 02:49:21.320
What's your question?

02:49:21.390 --> 02:49:24.257
This relates to
the bunny rabbit how?

02:49:25.328 --> 02:49:26.420
Get out.

02:49:26.495 --> 02:49:28.327

Uh, any of them gonna be holding
basketballs when they do it?

02:49:55.291 --> 02:49:56.725
Probably not.

02:49:56.792 --> 02:49:58.191
Well, you're here early.

02:49:58.260 --> 02:50:01.355

Dana in action.

I know she thinks
I'm in love with her,

02:50:47.143 --> 02:50:48.907
and that's all fine
as long as it's fun and games.

02:50:48.978 --> 02:50:51.072
But I want you to know
Dana's important to me.

02:50:51.147 --> 02:50:53.411
