00:06.131 --> 00:09.384
NETFLIX PRESENTS

00:37.996 --> 00:39.748
Hurry up, Gus. Hurry.

00:41.666 --> 00:43.877
-I'm coming!
-Hold on! Don't rush!

00:43.960 --> 00:47.922
-Good morning, Copi!
-Good morning, Mr. Manuel! Ms. Cuca!

00:48.631 --> 00:50.508
-Morning!
-Good morning!

00:52.177 --> 00:53.219
Be careful, kids.

00:56.181 --> 00:57.640
Careful, Copi!

00:57.724 --> 01:00.351
-That girl's full of energy!
-Sorry, coming through.

01:00.435 --> 01:02.062
Get your balloons here!

01:02.145 --> 01:03.313
Sorry, sir!

01:03.396 --> 01:05.732
-Please let me through.
-Watch it, little girl!

01:05.815 --> 01:07.358
Good morning, Mr. Old Man.

01:15.784 --> 01:17.827
Hey, don't litter!

01:20.830 --> 01:23.249
Watch out, Copi!
It's getting away from you!

01:24.000 --> 01:25.251
And it got away from you.

01:25.335 --> 01:26.753
Hey. Careful, girl!

01:26.836 --> 01:28.421
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

01:29.631 --> 01:31.549
I can't control it!

01:35.637 --> 01:37.055
My undies!

01:39.349 --> 01:40.517
Cut the string.

01:43.061 --> 01:44.813
Gus, cut it!

01:45.313 --> 01:46.648
-Hey, little girl--
-Xico!

01:52.195 --> 01:54.197
Well done, Xico! Yikes!

01:55.907 --> 01:57.117
Ouch.

02:06.167 --> 02:07.502
Nana Petra.

02:07.585 --> 02:08.962
Would you mind telling me

02:09.045 --> 02:13.967
why Mr. Rodolfo's underwear
is flying all over town?

02:18.847 --> 02:19.848
It's just that--

02:19.931 --> 02:21.474
No excuses, Copi.

02:21.558 --> 02:24.727
Now what are you going to do
to clean up this mess?

02:25.645 --> 02:26.646
I know!

02:27.438 --> 02:28.565
We'll do a challenge.

02:28.648 --> 02:31.401
You challenge our patience
enough already, young lady.

02:31.484 --> 02:33.153
A different kind of challenge.

02:34.279 --> 02:35.238
Thank goodness.

02:35.321 --> 02:38.908
As long as it isn't
one of your newfangled words,

02:38.992 --> 02:41.828
like "chill" or "cheesy."
I don't like them.

02:41.911 --> 02:43.371
What will the challenge be?

02:43.454 --> 02:47.041
Let's all pitch in
and clean this place up together!

02:47.750 --> 02:49.711
I forgot I have to go feed my cow.

02:54.924 --> 02:58.928
-See, Copi? It's just you and me.
-It's not just us, you silly.

02:59.012 --> 03:02.015
Isn't it? Other than you and me,
who else is here?

03:02.098 --> 03:03.433
Well, Xico is!

03:09.689 --> 03:10.523
Hey!

03:25.205 --> 03:28.750
What a peaceful town!
That's God's honest truth.

03:58.571 --> 04:03.117
Like I said before,
my dear prospective investors,

04:03.201 --> 04:08.373
this project is a gold mine.

04:08.456 --> 04:10.458
How surprising.

04:10.541 --> 04:12.252
Very surprising.

04:12.919 --> 04:16.422
You claimed there was more to it
than just gold, sir.

04:16.506 --> 04:19.008
To be precise, you mentioned--

04:19.092 --> 04:24.555
Minerals, natural gas, even diamonds!

04:24.639 --> 04:29.519
And how will we get
to these wonders, sir, if I may ask?

04:29.602 --> 04:34.232
By blowing up the mountain
with gunpowder and dynamite,

04:34.315 --> 04:38.569
and exploiting
its gas fields through fracking.

04:38.653 --> 04:42.365
Fracking? I've heard of fracking, but…

04:42.448 --> 04:44.993
You don't know what fracking is?

04:45.076 --> 04:47.829
No, he doesn't.

04:47.912 --> 04:51.541
Fracking, my dear Mr. Wang,

04:52.292 --> 04:55.044
is the future!

04:59.507 --> 05:02.260
It's quite a simple procedure.

05:02.343 --> 05:06.723
We drill a hole 15,000 ft. deep.

05:09.559 --> 05:14.272
Through this hole we inject a mixture
into the bowels of earth.

05:14.355 --> 05:18.901
A million gallons of water loaded with
methanol, benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene!

05:21.112 --> 05:23.990
Next, we get rid of
whatever is in the way.

05:24.073 --> 05:27.452
And then,
we do away with everything we don't need!

05:29.245 --> 05:33.166
And that's how we persuade Mother Nature,
that greedy old hag,

05:33.249 --> 05:37.211
to give up the riches
she hides in her depths!

05:39.547 --> 05:44.677
And tell us, where is this place
that we'll be investing in?

05:46.429 --> 05:50.266
That insignificant little mountain

05:50.350 --> 05:53.728
can be found… here.

05:53.811 --> 05:57.315
DEPOSITS OF RARE MINERALS
HEIGHT: 3 MILES

06:31.599 --> 06:33.017
What is it, Mother dear?

06:33.601 --> 06:35.395
Who's making you angry?

06:45.363 --> 06:48.074
What's that?
Why are the bells ringing, Grandma?

06:48.157 --> 06:52.412
Because Mr. Manuel
is summoning the townspeople to a meeting.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.580
-Now?
-Yes. It's odd.

06:54.664 --> 06:57.375
Copi, bring me my shawl, please.

07:02.964 --> 07:07.969
Xico…

07:13.182 --> 07:14.267
Xico…

07:16.310 --> 07:17.186
Xico!

07:18.020 --> 07:19.981
Hurry, before it starts to rain!

07:53.222 --> 07:57.560
People of San Jaime de las Jaibas!

07:57.643 --> 08:01.981
We've gathered here
to announce some wonderful news.

08:02.064 --> 08:08.029
Progress has finally come
to our beloved town, see?

08:08.112 --> 08:09.530
What a thrill, honestly.

08:13.075 --> 08:18.956
Ever since you elected me
Mayor of San Jaime de las Jaibas,

08:19.040 --> 08:22.627
my dear Jaiminos of the Crabs,

08:22.710 --> 08:26.547
I have worked tirelessly
for the well-being

08:26.631 --> 08:32.053
of our cherished
and dearly beloved community.

08:32.136 --> 08:33.012
Oh, ma'am?

08:33.554 --> 08:35.389
…true solidarity…

08:37.767 --> 08:41.020
Why does our town have "jaibas"
in its name?

08:41.938 --> 08:45.566
Because "jaibas" means "crabs,"
and eons ago, this entire land

08:45.650 --> 08:48.653
used to be at the bottom of the sea.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.032
When? Twenty years ago?

08:53.115 --> 08:55.368
No, you ignorant child.

08:55.451 --> 08:59.038
"Eons" means millions of years ago.

08:59.121 --> 09:00.289
Millions of years?

09:00.915 --> 09:03.417
Say, how old were you back then?

09:08.589 --> 09:10.174
…which is why the time has come

09:10.258 --> 09:14.428
to partake of the wealth hidden
in the depths of that mountain,

09:15.179 --> 09:17.473
to claim it as our own.

09:17.557 --> 09:18.474
What?

09:18.558 --> 09:22.395
What on earth
are you talking about, Manuel?

09:22.478 --> 09:27.817
The mountain is already ours.
And it is our greatest wealth.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.194
Yes, Nana Petra, yes.

09:30.278 --> 09:35.116
But the issue here is that the mountain is

09:35.199 --> 09:37.368
full of gold!

09:37.910 --> 09:39.829
That could come in handy, no?

09:41.497 --> 09:44.625
And these esteemed gentlemen

09:44.709 --> 09:48.921
have graciously agreed to help us
capitalize on the mountain's wealth.

09:49.005 --> 09:54.760
It was already ours,
but now it'll be more so than ever.

09:54.844 --> 09:56.012
What do you think?

09:56.095 --> 09:58.180
I wouldn't mind a little gold.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.974
Neither would I.

10:00.057 --> 10:03.102
I could even put up
that zip line I always wanted.

10:04.228 --> 10:07.565
What's wrong with you?

10:07.648 --> 10:10.443
How dare you even consider it!

10:10.526 --> 10:16.115
Look, Grandma,
if you want to represent the opposition,

10:16.198 --> 10:17.783
go to Congress.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.535
And you can go to--

10:19.619 --> 10:20.578
Granny!

10:22.246 --> 10:25.708
How long would it take
to extract that gold?

10:26.751 --> 10:31.380
It would be a matter of weeks,
my dear and esteemed Jamaicans.

10:31.464 --> 10:35.301
-Jaiminos of the Crabs.
-Sounds the same to me.

10:35.384 --> 10:38.012
And how much would each of us get?

10:38.095 --> 10:41.766
Well, we'd have to do some calculations,

10:41.849 --> 10:45.061
increase the variables,
decrease the weighted elements,

10:45.144 --> 10:46.896
add the risk percentage,

10:46.979 --> 10:50.066
and divide it
by the number you were thinking of.

10:51.442 --> 10:55.571
Yes, I can picture myself
all dolled up, Policarpo!

10:55.655 --> 11:00.117
And how are you planning
to get all that from our mountain?

11:00.201 --> 11:03.579
Look, that's easy,
my dear gray-haired woman.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.915
We're using fracking!

11:05.998 --> 11:08.042
Hey, wait a minute.

11:08.542 --> 11:11.796
I've read a lot
about fracking, and it's not good at all.

11:11.879 --> 11:15.508
Don't worry.
It's not that bad either, little girl.

11:15.591 --> 11:19.595
Actually, the process
is quite environmentally friendly.

11:19.679 --> 11:23.432
The worst thing
it could do is destroy your crops,

11:23.516 --> 11:24.934
poison your cattle,

11:25.017 --> 11:27.937
and cause a couple of earthquakes.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.605
Now I don't get it.

11:30.314 --> 11:34.193
But very mild ones… very mild.

11:34.276 --> 11:38.781
-Just remember, Jaiminians--
-Jaiminos of the Crabs.

11:39.365 --> 11:43.786
Just remember, there are two types
of people in this world,

11:43.869 --> 11:50.668
those who get everything they want
and those who never even dare to try.

11:51.836 --> 11:54.046
Well, I'm someone who knows what he wants.

11:54.130 --> 11:58.551
But remember,
my dear Jaiminos of the Crabs,

11:58.634 --> 12:02.346
I came up with this great idea.

12:02.430 --> 12:07.351
So, when I run for state governor,

12:07.435 --> 12:09.979
don't forget your beloved…

12:10.062 --> 12:11.522
I mean,

12:11.605 --> 12:13.149
dearly beloved Manuel.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.317
-Long live Mr. Manuel!
-Mr. Manuel!

12:15.818 --> 12:17.153
You're the best!

12:17.653 --> 12:19.530
Long live rock and roll!

12:28.289 --> 12:30.624
You look after our interests,

12:30.708 --> 12:35.671
and we'll look after yours
as if they were ours.

12:39.633 --> 12:43.262
Wait!

12:44.138 --> 12:46.891
Wait! You don't know what…

12:52.938 --> 12:54.774
Mr. Old Man!

12:54.857 --> 12:55.858
We need to talk.

12:55.941 --> 12:59.737
My dear Petra, darling, not now.

13:00.237 --> 13:06.368
Can't you see
I'm all stiff, gray, and rusty?

13:06.452 --> 13:10.706
I think
I'd better go home and get some rest

13:10.790 --> 13:14.919
because I've been working all day.

13:15.002 --> 13:18.798
Cuca, help me. I beg you.

13:19.381 --> 13:23.719
And rob my son of his chance
to become the governor of the state

13:23.803 --> 13:27.056
over a mere mountain?

13:27.139 --> 13:31.143
Oh, Petra, always so idealistic.

13:47.243 --> 13:51.163
Come on. There are other ways,
but we have to open them.

13:51.247 --> 13:52.915
Right, Xico?

14:00.172 --> 14:02.675
Ways? Open them?

14:02.758 --> 14:05.302
Come on. I'm waiting!

14:32.913 --> 14:35.791
Tell me right now, my dear Manuel,

14:35.875 --> 14:40.462
what's all this craziness you're scheming?

14:40.546 --> 14:43.883
What's there to say, Mom?
Mommy, my darling mom.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.052
Just tell me you're not thinking

14:47.136 --> 14:50.848
of blowing up the mountain
like those men said.

14:50.931 --> 14:54.226
Mom! I'd never, Ma!

14:54.310 --> 14:59.398
They're barely scratching it,
a little here, a little there.

14:59.481 --> 15:01.859
No one will even notice.

15:02.651 --> 15:05.571
Will you give me your word
as the good boy you are?

15:05.654 --> 15:08.657
Have I ever lied to you, Mommy?

15:08.741 --> 15:11.827
Me? You know me, Mom.

15:13.203 --> 15:17.124
Okay. In that case, I'll sleep soundly.

15:22.755 --> 15:26.467
Good night, Mommy, may you rest…

15:27.343 --> 15:29.428
in peace.

15:43.442 --> 15:46.695
Grandma, what ways were you talking about?

15:50.324 --> 15:52.826
Why must we open the ways?

15:54.536 --> 15:55.788
And one more thing,

15:55.871 --> 15:59.208
why do you talk
to the mountain as if it were a person?

16:05.214 --> 16:07.591
I've seen you do it… many times.

16:09.635 --> 16:13.222
Copi, I'm old and weary.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.349
Can we go to bed?

16:15.432 --> 16:16.517
You see, Xico?

16:16.600 --> 16:18.644
Another question with no answer.

16:18.727 --> 16:19.853
What are you saying?

16:20.521 --> 16:23.857
That you hide stuff from me
when it suits you.

16:23.941 --> 16:27.861
Copi, I promise,
you'll understand one day.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.113
Yeah, right.

16:29.196 --> 16:31.281
Just like someday I'll understand

16:31.365 --> 16:34.493
that my mom left
and never came back for me.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.838
Give her time, Xico. Give her time.

18:31.443 --> 18:32.402
Copi!

18:32.486 --> 18:34.113
Gus, what are you doing here?

18:34.196 --> 18:36.156
I got up early for school.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.659
Come on. We're on vacation.

18:38.742 --> 18:41.078
Guess what, I heard a noise
and peeked out the window.

18:41.161 --> 18:43.914
-And I saw Nana Petra--
-Nana Petra!

18:44.540 --> 18:48.460
-I lost track of her because of you.
-Why me? How is this my fault?

18:56.885 --> 18:57.970
Let's go.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.434
Mr. Old Man.

19:04.518 --> 19:06.186
Password?

19:06.854 --> 19:09.731
It's Petra. Open up, please.

19:17.656 --> 19:21.869
Well, look at you!
Gorgeous and dazzling as ever!

19:23.078 --> 19:27.124
Oh, stop, Mr. Old Man.
I'm not in the mood for your banter.

19:27.207 --> 19:29.126
The mountain is in danger.

19:29.209 --> 19:31.378
Our Mother dear?

19:31.461 --> 19:35.299
You know there's always
someone evil and greedy out there.

19:35.924 --> 19:41.054
But the last time it was in danger
was when your--

19:43.348 --> 19:48.103
We have to open the ways again,
reunite the three stones,

19:48.896 --> 19:51.148
and find the messenger.

19:51.231 --> 19:54.651
Goodness gracious, Petra,
you may be only as old as you feel,

19:54.735 --> 19:57.070
but even so,
we're too old for such antics.

19:58.488 --> 20:02.075
But we're the guardians
of the stones, Mr. Old Man.

20:02.159 --> 20:03.869
Hey, what are they talking about?

20:04.578 --> 20:07.956
The stones are fine, that's right.

20:08.957 --> 20:15.547
That is, assuming she'll be willing
to unite her stone with ours.

20:15.631 --> 20:20.928
As to the ways, well,
you're the one who can open them.

20:21.011 --> 20:25.015
But this business
of finding the messenger,

20:25.098 --> 20:28.602
I have to be honest with you,
that's where I draw the line.

20:29.311 --> 20:34.608
If I must,
I will go into the mountain to find him.

20:36.526 --> 20:42.616
Must I remind you about repercussions,
my sweet Petra?

20:42.699 --> 20:47.788
Go out there, and you'll end up
like your daughter Lupita.

20:47.871 --> 20:50.916
The mountain claimed her,

20:50.999 --> 20:55.712
and the mountain has her.

20:55.796 --> 20:57.172
We must do something.

20:57.256 --> 21:03.262
Well, you know I'm in,
but I can't say if she will be.

21:04.763 --> 21:07.933
Hey, Copi,
what do they mean, your mom-- Copi!

21:14.064 --> 21:15.857
Xico, hurry!

21:53.270 --> 21:58.608
We're about to begin
the mother of all excavations.

21:58.692 --> 22:02.863
We just need to get to the site
that will serve as our headquarters.

22:03.447 --> 22:05.282
And that will be?

22:05.365 --> 22:08.994
A place no one cares about.

22:15.542 --> 22:16.752
Petra.

22:16.835 --> 22:17.961
Cuca.

22:19.796 --> 22:21.757
What are you doing at my place?

22:21.840 --> 22:28.597
Maybe I was confined to hell for my sins,
and this is my penance.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.515
Why don't you ever bathe?

22:30.599 --> 22:33.685
Look who should talk!
Why don't you ever iron?

22:33.769 --> 22:34.603
Enough!

22:34.686 --> 22:36.480
Your face, I mean.

22:36.563 --> 22:40.067
We are the guardians of the stones.

22:40.150 --> 22:41.443
What do I care?

22:41.526 --> 22:45.989
There must be harmony between us
to bring the stones together.

22:46.073 --> 22:48.408
I find myself short on harmony
in his presence.

22:48.492 --> 22:52.245
The mountain is in danger. You know it.

22:52.329 --> 22:56.166
And I need not remind you
whose fault that is.

23:02.714 --> 23:04.216
We need your stone, Cuca.

23:04.299 --> 23:06.009
I told you, Petra,

23:06.093 --> 23:10.263
my little Manuel's political aspirations
are much more important than--

23:10.347 --> 23:13.642
Nana Petra, Copi is gone!
She went to the mountain!

23:13.725 --> 23:16.937
-What? Why?
-She went to look for her mom!

23:21.691 --> 23:23.235
What do you see, doggy?

23:41.002 --> 23:42.879
What are you saying, son?

23:42.963 --> 23:46.258
We overheard you and Mr. Old Man.

23:46.341 --> 23:50.554
He said your daughter
is trapped inside the mountain.

23:50.637 --> 23:54.224
And before I could say anything,
Copi ran off with Xico.

23:55.225 --> 23:56.852
Cuca, your stone.

23:56.935 --> 24:00.605
I already lost my daughter.
I won't lose my granddaughter too.

24:00.689 --> 24:03.150
Give me your stone. Come on, hurry.

24:04.568 --> 24:05.735
Finally.

24:05.819 --> 24:09.406
Not so tough after all, are you?

24:09.990 --> 24:12.117
Is that a trilobite?

24:12.200 --> 24:13.702
Yes.

24:14.286 --> 24:20.959
From when San Jaime de las Jaibas
was under the sea.

24:21.793 --> 24:22.627
And?

24:23.753 --> 24:25.672
The only one who can make them work

24:25.755 --> 24:28.925
and do what they were made to do
is the messenger.

24:29.009 --> 24:30.927
I'll go look for him.

24:31.011 --> 24:32.179
Petra,

24:33.013 --> 24:38.018
you know as well as I you'd never make it
to the center of the mountain alive.

24:38.101 --> 24:41.521
You're too old, my dear Petra.

24:41.605 --> 24:44.483
But someone must take the stones there.

24:44.566 --> 24:45.734
I'll go.

24:45.817 --> 24:48.153
Copi and Xico are my friends.

24:48.236 --> 24:49.070
No, Gus.

24:49.988 --> 24:51.448
It's too dangerous.

24:51.531 --> 24:54.826
But without the stone,
they won't find the way, right?

24:54.910 --> 24:58.163
First, we have to take
the stone to the messenger.

24:58.246 --> 25:00.165
Don't worry, Nana Petra.

25:00.248 --> 25:01.500
I got this.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.418
Gus, wait!

25:04.753 --> 25:08.089
Don't worry, my dear Petra.

25:08.173 --> 25:13.136
Youth is strong.
You can help them in your own way.

25:13.762 --> 25:16.473
By opening the ways for them.

25:20.644 --> 25:23.438
History is repeating itself.

26:23.999 --> 26:27.752
Mother, mountain of mine, I beseech thee.

26:27.836 --> 26:31.256
I beg you to open your ways
and let these children travel unharmed,

26:31.339 --> 26:35.969
that they may find the messenger within.

26:54.321 --> 26:58.533
They're coming to you
with love and respect.

26:59.200 --> 27:04.122
Watch over them as we watch over you.

27:12.213 --> 27:14.716
The entrance
to the mountain must be around here.

27:14.799 --> 27:16.217
It's the only way in.

27:19.179 --> 27:20.180
What's that?

27:25.268 --> 27:28.772
Xico, are you cold, boy? You're blue.

27:29.689 --> 27:32.984
To enter the mountain
you have come, I see.

27:33.860 --> 27:38.198
Don't even think about fooling me.
You are Copi, and he is Xico.

27:38.281 --> 27:39.741
Allow me to introduce myself.

27:39.824 --> 27:42.160
Tochtli I am, and I'm a rabbit.

27:42.243 --> 27:45.497
If you wish to silence me,
go ahead and have at it.

27:47.082 --> 27:51.503
You're a rabbit that talks?

27:51.586 --> 27:53.630
Talks in verse, mind you.

27:53.713 --> 27:55.715
Xico? You can talk too?

27:56.383 --> 27:58.885
Can I? Yes indeed, I can talk!

27:58.968 --> 28:02.055
Just like you.
And I don't make a fuss about it.

28:02.639 --> 28:05.266
It's great
to understand your speech, buddy.

28:05.350 --> 28:07.227
This is no witchcraft.

28:07.310 --> 28:11.606
You yourself made it happen.
Some part of you has brought you here,

28:11.690 --> 28:14.109
to the far end you were looking for.

28:14.192 --> 28:16.986
I don't understand anything he says.

28:17.070 --> 28:20.657
I'm here to look for my mom.
She's trapped in the mountain.

28:23.785 --> 28:27.872
Let's go, let's go, it is indeed
my purpose to pave the way for you.

28:27.956 --> 28:30.875
'Tis a good day to fulfill destinies.

28:30.959 --> 28:32.544
Wait. I'm going with you.

28:37.465 --> 28:39.050
What are you doing here?

28:40.260 --> 28:43.054
Nana Petra asked me to give you this.

28:43.638 --> 28:47.392
Machinery is on its way,
and only the messenger can help us.

28:47.475 --> 28:50.061
I bet he can tell us where my mom is, too!

28:51.396 --> 28:55.984
They're th-- the sto-- the stones!

28:56.067 --> 28:57.569
The stones?

28:57.652 --> 29:00.488
Yes, the very stones!

29:02.198 --> 29:04.200
Oh, a talking rabbit!

29:04.284 --> 29:07.203
-And he talks in rhymes.
-What? You can talk too?

29:23.928 --> 29:25.430
Quick!

29:25.513 --> 29:28.224
You have to run, make haste!
Of ways there is but one,

29:28.308 --> 29:31.019
and it had better not go to waste!

29:35.857 --> 29:37.108
Aren't you coming, Tochtli?

29:37.192 --> 29:41.529
Don't make the same old mistake.
I am a rabbit. Not a snake.

29:41.613 --> 29:44.699
I tell fortune in the moon's belly button.

29:52.040 --> 29:54.250
-It's closing.
-Let's go, then!

30:20.735 --> 30:22.237
Wow!

30:46.845 --> 30:49.848
Wow, where are we?

30:50.473 --> 30:52.767
Inside the mountain.

30:54.561 --> 30:56.437
I know, Xi-- co.

30:56.521 --> 30:58.982
Sorry, I'm still not used to you talking.

30:59.065 --> 31:00.775
Xico, you're green!

31:00.859 --> 31:03.653
Don't worry, Xico.
It must be the light in here.

31:04.153 --> 31:05.321
It's kind of weird.

31:05.405 --> 31:06.406
Stop right there.

31:06.489 --> 31:07.699
Who goes there?

31:09.117 --> 31:10.785
-Who was that?
-The tree.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.161
-The tree?
-The tree?

31:12.245 --> 31:14.998
You better start getting used to all this.

31:40.899 --> 31:43.943
You aren't made of stone
like all the other trees.

31:44.027 --> 31:49.115
Actually… I'm the only one
who hasn't turned into stone.

31:50.033 --> 31:51.910
That's what happened to the others?

31:54.829 --> 32:01.628
They're dying little by little.
All of the trees are turning into stone.

32:04.380 --> 32:08.301
And the closer the machines
approach to destroy the forest,

32:08.384 --> 32:10.386
the more threatened they feel.

32:10.470 --> 32:12.639
What a smart dog.

32:12.722 --> 32:15.224
Mr. Tree, I've come looking for my mom.

32:15.308 --> 32:18.227
-And for the messenger.
-We've brought these stones.

32:19.938 --> 32:20.772
I see.

32:21.272 --> 32:22.398
Well, well.

32:23.566 --> 32:27.862
I never thought someone
would be coming back so soon.

32:27.946 --> 32:31.699
Welcome, stonebearers.

32:32.450 --> 32:35.370
-What's wrong?
-Are you crying?

32:35.453 --> 32:39.666
There's a time for tears
and a time for laughter.

32:39.749 --> 32:41.209
Now we cry,

32:41.292 --> 32:45.588
but maybe with your arrival,
we'll laugh once again.

32:46.214 --> 32:49.717
Here. When you find the messenger,

32:49.801 --> 32:52.220
he'll tell you what to do with them.

32:53.388 --> 32:57.225
To find-- Oh no! They're here.

33:01.187 --> 33:04.273
Not again! No.

33:05.900 --> 33:07.068
Run!

34:13.676 --> 34:15.011
You don't waste any time.

34:15.094 --> 34:18.639
There are three things you mustn't waste.

34:18.723 --> 34:20.558
-Time.
-Power.

34:20.641 --> 34:23.728
And money.

34:36.783 --> 34:41.954
Welcome to the future,
my dear and esteemed chubby friend.

34:56.427 --> 34:58.054
Oh, Nana Petra.

34:58.137 --> 35:00.014
I can't find Gus anywhere.

35:00.098 --> 35:02.725
I thought maybe he was with Copi.

35:04.685 --> 35:07.105
Carmen, we need to talk.

35:21.452 --> 35:25.123
That was a serious tremor, bros.

35:33.756 --> 35:38.761
What's up? What's happenin'?
Why are you staring at me? Am I that ugly?

35:39.387 --> 35:42.390
-You're hideous.
-Shut up.

35:42.473 --> 35:47.061
-You look like a rat.
-I said, shut up! He's an opossum.

35:47.145 --> 35:50.022
I'm Tlacuache… and proud of it!

35:53.985 --> 35:55.987
Look, gentleman. Listen, little lady.

35:56.070 --> 36:02.660
Introducing, presenting… Tlacuache,
the one and only Mexican marsupial.

36:02.743 --> 36:05.663
Not a knockoff, not a fake.

36:05.746 --> 36:10.084
Complete with bald tail and belly pouch.

36:10.168 --> 36:12.253
It always comes in handy.

36:12.336 --> 36:15.506
Look! Buy now!
Take home a Tlacuache of your own!

36:15.590 --> 36:19.802
And remember,
if it's made in Mexico, it's well made.

36:23.890 --> 36:27.226
Oh, sorry,
once a salesman, always a salesman.

36:28.686 --> 36:31.647
So, tell me, dudes.
What brings you kids here?

36:36.194 --> 36:38.529
We're here to find the messenger.

36:38.613 --> 36:39.614
And my mom.

36:39.697 --> 36:42.408
-With these stones.
-And these tears from the tree.

36:42.491 --> 36:43.951
Wow!

36:44.035 --> 36:46.537
You're super prepared.

36:46.621 --> 36:51.792
Oh, the famous stones
that find their way to each other.

36:52.585 --> 36:55.046
Tears from the Ahuehuete tree.

36:55.129 --> 36:57.256
Great against the evil eye.

36:57.757 --> 36:59.550
And a Xoloitzcuintle dog.

37:00.301 --> 37:01.844
-A purple one.
-Purple?

37:02.428 --> 37:04.096
I'm purple now?

37:05.973 --> 37:07.642
You know what, dudes?

37:07.725 --> 37:09.894
You better get inside.

37:09.977 --> 37:13.606
Things are about
to get pretty heavy out here.

37:15.816 --> 37:20.112
And besides, it seems to me
that walls have ears here.

37:28.746 --> 37:31.249
Go on in, kids.

37:34.877 --> 37:39.090
Oh, how could you
let this happen, Nana Petra?

37:39.173 --> 37:41.133
I couldn't avoid it.

37:41.217 --> 37:44.845
You couldn't avoid it? They're just kids.

37:44.929 --> 37:47.848
And what's
all this nonsense you're talking about?

37:47.932 --> 37:52.728
I'm not asking you to understand, Carmen.
I'm asking you to trust me.

37:58.859 --> 38:01.237
You sent my son
and your granddaughter out there!

38:01.320 --> 38:03.906
I can't believe it, Nana Petra!

38:03.990 --> 38:07.118
Especially after what happened
to your son-in-law, Juan,

38:07.201 --> 38:08.286
and to Lupita!

38:08.828 --> 38:13.749
Show some compassion,
for goodness sake, my dear Carmen.

38:13.833 --> 38:15.668
I'm very sorry, Mr. Old Man.

38:15.751 --> 38:19.964
Do you think those companies
think twice before destroying everything?

38:20.047 --> 38:22.591
They'll take down anything to make money.

38:22.675 --> 38:25.678
They destroy entire communities.
They kill people!

38:25.761 --> 38:31.726
But we've beaten them before, Carmen.
Always, throughout the years.

38:31.809 --> 38:36.355
But Nana Petra, those people are armed
and willing to do anything!

38:37.356 --> 38:41.569
Need I remind you?
Juan and Lupita are dead.

38:46.490 --> 38:48.492
Where are you going, Carmen?

38:48.576 --> 38:51.579
You can stay here
and keep talking about your nonsense.

38:51.662 --> 38:54.999
Messengers, guardians, magic stones.

38:55.082 --> 38:57.626
I'm going to look for my son and for Copi.

39:01.464 --> 39:04.091
What should we do now, Petra?

39:04.175 --> 39:09.430
What do you mean, Mr. Old Man?
Follow her, of course. She can't go alone.

39:09.513 --> 39:12.641
The brave charge forward and die.

39:12.725 --> 39:17.021
Cowards stay back and survive.

39:17.104 --> 39:20.358
And, look, there aren't many of us left.

39:20.441 --> 39:24.403
Move it. I'm not waiting
for you to stop blabbering.

39:26.113 --> 39:29.408
Come on in. Make yourselves at home, guys.

39:29.992 --> 39:31.660
Want to see my treasures?

39:31.744 --> 39:32.870
Look around.

39:32.953 --> 39:39.752
Sorry, dudes. I don't clean up much.
Being a shaman doesn't pay too well.

39:39.835 --> 39:43.589
This boot walked through the whole desert.

39:45.966 --> 39:48.052
This hat flew from Africa.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.514
A lazy boy's journal.

39:55.518 --> 39:57.061
These undies…

39:58.729 --> 40:00.898
if only they could talk.

40:03.150 --> 40:06.695
Oh, the little Xoloitzcuintle
got serious now.

40:07.446 --> 40:09.949
Come on, bro. Don't look at me like that.

40:11.909 --> 40:14.578
Well, I know I'm ugly as heck,

40:14.662 --> 40:17.331
but do you know who I am?

40:17.415 --> 40:20.418
The Mexican Prometheus, bros.

40:20.501 --> 40:25.131
I'm the one who stole fire
from the gods to give it to man.

40:25.214 --> 40:31.637
It's true. I stole fire using my tail.
That's why it's all scorched. Look.

40:32.138 --> 40:35.474
And that's why I still collect things now.

40:36.642 --> 40:39.061
The habit stuck, you bet.

40:41.605 --> 40:45.234
And what about you, bud?
You know who you are, right?

40:45.317 --> 40:47.278
-Yes, I'm Xico.
-Right.

40:47.361 --> 40:49.572
And I'm a Xoloitzcuintle dog.

40:50.489 --> 40:53.868
You have no idea who you are, huh?

40:54.743 --> 40:59.957
Look, man, I'll be straight with you,
I'll tell you who you are.

41:07.590 --> 41:08.757
Take a look, kid.

41:08.841 --> 41:11.177
This is you.

41:11.260 --> 41:14.597
You come from an ancient breed, friend.

41:16.557 --> 41:19.935
It was Xólotl, the god of twilight,

41:20.019 --> 41:25.232
master of the evening star
and the underworld, who created you.

41:29.236 --> 41:31.947
Your great-great-great-great-grandfather

41:32.740 --> 41:35.534
Your great-great-great-great-grandfather

41:37.786 --> 41:42.416
Xólotl created you
from a splinter of the bone of life.

41:44.168 --> 41:46.086
That's why you're so skinny.

41:46.170 --> 41:47.004
Hey!

41:47.087 --> 41:49.548
Your great-great-great-great-grandfather

41:50.299 --> 41:53.052
Your great-great-great-great-grandfather

41:54.220 --> 41:55.471
No biggie.

41:55.554 --> 41:58.432
You're magical. And you are a healer.

41:58.516 --> 42:02.811
Companion to the living under the sun
and to the dead in darkness.

42:02.895 --> 42:05.147
Your great-great-great-great-grandfather

42:05.231 --> 42:06.065
Me?

42:06.148 --> 42:08.734
Your great-great-great-great-grandfather

42:09.568 --> 42:12.363
Your great-great-great-great-grandfather

42:12.947 --> 42:15.783
Your great-great-great-great-grandfather

42:16.492 --> 42:19.245
And that's how you came to Earth

42:19.328 --> 42:22.790
To carry out your great mission!

42:34.134 --> 42:37.096
So, you're my magical guardian, doggy.

42:37.179 --> 42:38.472
Whoa there.

42:38.556 --> 42:40.182
What do you mean, "doggy"?

42:40.266 --> 42:45.437
He's no French poodle, my friend.
He's a Xoloitzcuintle, girl.

42:45.521 --> 42:46.897
So, show some respect

42:46.981 --> 42:51.068
to the one who'll help you
cross the Mictlán when you bite the dust.

42:53.028 --> 42:57.032
Which, of course,
is still a ways off, huh?

42:59.076 --> 43:02.538
Well, thanks for defending me,
but we're in a hurry.

43:02.621 --> 43:04.582
Show us which way to go.

43:05.666 --> 43:07.960
That depends, brother.

43:08.043 --> 43:10.879
Are you going in or out?

43:10.963 --> 43:12.006
Going up

43:12.548 --> 43:13.632
or going down?

43:14.300 --> 43:17.928
-We're looking for the messenger.
-We're looking for my mom.

43:18.637 --> 43:21.974
Why don't we go looking for both?

43:22.975 --> 43:24.977
Look here, you little brats.

43:25.477 --> 43:26.729
Is there a messenger?

43:27.229 --> 43:28.772
Yes.

43:29.398 --> 43:32.818
But to find him, you must walk a long way.

43:32.901 --> 43:36.155
A very long way
until you reach the core of the mountain.

43:37.406 --> 43:41.076
It's like walking
to the center of the universe.

43:41.619 --> 43:42.661
There's a woman.

43:43.370 --> 43:45.080
Yes!

43:45.164 --> 43:48.792
But I have to warn you,
I don't know if she's your mommy or not.

43:48.876 --> 43:50.210
How do we get there?

43:51.170 --> 43:54.423
You have to walk a long way.
A very long way.

43:54.965 --> 43:57.551
Until you reach the core of the mountain.

43:57.635 --> 44:01.930
It's like walking
to the center of the universe.

44:05.559 --> 44:06.769
To the same place?

44:06.852 --> 44:09.063
Of course, my horse.

44:09.146 --> 44:10.939
Then why all the mystery?

44:11.023 --> 44:16.236
Well, there's style to consider.
More groove, more production value.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.279
Get it?

44:21.825 --> 44:22.660
What is that?

44:22.743 --> 44:26.789
The men are blowing up the mountain.

44:26.872 --> 44:29.958
-How do you know?
-He's magical.

44:31.710 --> 44:33.754
-Tlacuache!
-Is he dead?

44:33.837 --> 44:35.881
No, that's what they do.

44:35.964 --> 44:38.634
When they're in danger, they play dead.

44:42.137 --> 44:43.639
Shoo!

44:57.903 --> 45:00.030
Oh snap! Now what? Where to?

45:00.114 --> 45:02.700
Don't talk like that, really.

45:02.783 --> 45:04.743
You sound like Tlacuache.

45:04.827 --> 45:08.580
Well, you sound like Ms. Cuca,
prim and proper.

45:08.664 --> 45:11.417
-Hey!
-You guys, it's that way!

45:28.851 --> 45:31.186
Sir, my dear partners,

45:31.270 --> 45:34.356
I mean, my dearest partners,
we have a problem.

45:34.440 --> 45:37.317
That gray-haired woman is hardheaded.

45:37.401 --> 45:39.319
I knew she would be.

45:39.403 --> 45:42.281
Sir, in this town, I'm the law.

45:42.364 --> 45:46.493
And if she makes a fuss, I'll arrest her
for obstructing the march of progress.

45:46.577 --> 45:47.995
How do you like that?

45:53.709 --> 45:58.589
Tell me, old lady, what is it now?

45:59.298 --> 46:04.678
What part of you respecting
our sacred mountain don't you get?

46:04.762 --> 46:08.056
We could negotiate, my good lady.

46:08.599 --> 46:09.892
Name your price.

46:09.975 --> 46:15.063
In return we want no meddling from you
while we mine the mountain's riches.

46:15.147 --> 46:17.733
My price? I'm not a broom.

46:17.816 --> 46:21.820
Ma'am, what my partner evidently means

46:21.904 --> 46:24.531
is that in your town you're an influencer.

46:24.615 --> 46:28.327
Hey, don't insult the lady.

46:28.410 --> 46:30.746
She has my utmost respect.

46:32.539 --> 46:35.751
What I mean
is that you have influence over people.

46:35.834 --> 46:39.254
And if you step down, ma'am,
everyone else will follow your lead.

46:39.338 --> 46:42.132
But, Mr. Manuel,
you're the voice of authority.

46:42.216 --> 46:43.884
You can't allow this.

46:45.636 --> 46:51.308
I'm afraid your voice of authority
has signed over his authorization.

46:52.476 --> 46:55.437
We'll let the entire community know,
Mr. Manuel.

46:55.521 --> 46:59.983
And we'll sue you
for destroying our natural resources.

47:00.067 --> 47:03.237
Get on with the fracking and the dynamite.

47:03.320 --> 47:05.405
There are two kids inside the mountain!

47:06.532 --> 47:07.866
You're lying.

47:07.950 --> 47:09.284
No, I swear.

47:09.368 --> 47:10.869
-You're lying.
-I'm not.

47:10.953 --> 47:12.746
-The truth, now!
-That's the truth!

47:12.830 --> 47:14.790
-I don't believe you.
-You must.

47:14.873 --> 47:16.416
Go on, try harder!

47:16.500 --> 47:19.002
-I don't know what else to say.
-The truth!

47:19.086 --> 47:22.506
Two children are in there,
and one of them is my son!

47:22.589 --> 47:26.510
Manuel, Gus and Copi
are inside the mountain.

47:26.593 --> 47:28.345
Gus and Copi?

47:28.428 --> 47:29.388
And Xico.

47:33.475 --> 47:37.020
I'll try my best to delay the drilling.

47:37.104 --> 47:39.231
What did you say? Speak up.

47:40.232 --> 47:43.360
I'm convincing them to delay that lawsuit.

47:43.443 --> 47:44.987
Coward!

47:47.489 --> 47:51.952
I'm sorry, Nana Petra,
but today you went too far.

47:52.035 --> 47:55.789
Did I say "too far"?
Way beyond the limits of far.

47:56.832 --> 48:00.294
You always had a way with words, Manuel.

48:01.003 --> 48:04.089
We'll see if you keep it up

48:04.172 --> 48:08.176
when Copi and Gus remain missing.

48:08.260 --> 48:10.178
That's a different story.

48:10.262 --> 48:14.141
What you did today
is called disrespecting authority.

48:14.224 --> 48:16.727
Though those kids' safety is in my hands.

48:16.810 --> 48:19.855
There's a rescue team searching the area.

48:20.856 --> 48:23.358
Performing a very thorough search…
of that area.

48:27.988 --> 48:30.824
You just don't understand, Manuel.

48:30.908 --> 48:34.328
You never have.

48:41.209 --> 48:42.586
Gus, come on!

49:16.620 --> 49:20.040
I can't go any farther. It's too hot.

49:20.123 --> 49:23.752
-We're in a desert.
-Yes, but inside a mountain?

49:25.128 --> 49:27.089
Watch out! Behind you!

49:29.883 --> 49:32.427
Who are you? Why are you following us?

49:32.511 --> 49:33.720
I'm Xappan.

49:33.804 --> 49:37.349
Tell me where you're going.
Tell me before I kill you.

49:37.432 --> 49:39.643
We're looking for my mom!

49:39.726 --> 49:40.769
We're on a mission!

49:40.852 --> 49:43.105
And with the stones,
we'll save the mountain!

49:43.188 --> 49:44.481
The stones!

49:44.564 --> 49:47.651
Gods made this mountain,

49:47.734 --> 49:50.070
and for that it must be destroyed.

49:50.696 --> 49:53.532
Even gods must pay the price of treason.

50:00.163 --> 50:01.039
Run!

50:10.007 --> 50:12.175
Xico, you were very brave.

50:14.302 --> 50:15.470
Oh wow!

50:15.554 --> 50:17.889
Look, now he's orange.

50:17.973 --> 50:19.391
I know.

50:19.474 --> 50:22.019
Your dog is radioactive.

50:22.519 --> 50:25.230
I told you, Xico is magical.

50:25.313 --> 50:28.066
You know I can hear you, right?

50:28.150 --> 50:31.361
Come on, we need to stay hydrated
if we want to keep going.

50:57.179 --> 50:59.306
I'm so tired.

51:04.478 --> 51:06.271
Something here doesn't…

51:09.316 --> 51:10.692
feel right.

51:11.902 --> 51:13.445
Copi!

51:15.113 --> 51:16.573
Revenge!

51:20.368 --> 51:21.870
Nana Petra.

51:21.953 --> 51:24.164
Petra, my darling.

51:24.247 --> 51:25.373
My little girl.

51:25.457 --> 51:27.501
No, Copi!

51:33.256 --> 51:35.383
There's nothing you can do.

51:40.180 --> 51:42.516
Something hurts inside my chest.

51:42.599 --> 51:45.185
And I feel dizzy.

51:52.526 --> 51:55.487
Xico, she has a really high fever.

51:55.570 --> 51:59.866
-You'll be okay, Copi, I promise.
-We need to do something, but what?

52:00.951 --> 52:05.205
Take care of her. I'll find the messenger.
I'm sure he can help cure Copi.

52:06.706 --> 52:08.208
Nana Petra.

52:09.584 --> 52:10.502
Carmen…

52:11.378 --> 52:12.671
It was as if…

52:12.754 --> 52:15.549
Petra Padilla,
Espiridión García, Carmen López.

52:16.550 --> 52:19.427
You're free to go.
Someone's posted your bail.

52:19.511 --> 52:20.804
But who?

52:22.430 --> 52:23.431
Petra.

52:24.850 --> 52:25.767
Cuca.

52:26.351 --> 52:28.395
What made you change your mind?

52:28.478 --> 52:33.275
If we can't tell right from wrong
at our age…

52:34.192 --> 52:36.570
We have a lot to do. Hurry!

52:44.411 --> 52:46.872
Quick! We must warn the townspeople

52:46.955 --> 52:50.667
about the true intentions
of those evildoers!

52:56.047 --> 52:57.215
Let's go!

52:57.299 --> 52:58.175
Okay!

52:58.258 --> 52:59.593
BACK IN 10 MINUTES

53:19.237 --> 53:21.198
Xico…

53:24.618 --> 53:26.453
Xico…

53:44.346 --> 53:47.140
Everything is ready to start fracking!

54:21.883 --> 54:24.636
This is the moment
we've all been waiting for.

54:24.719 --> 54:30.934
The moment when millions and millions
of gallons of methanol and ethylbenzene

54:31.017 --> 54:33.728
will fracture the mountain rock,

54:33.812 --> 54:40.318
so drillers can break through and slide in
like a hot knife through butter.

54:41.987 --> 54:47.242
Mr. Frevler, you never said
they'd use that much dynamite.

54:47.325 --> 54:51.496
Frankly, my dear friend,
I couldn't care less.

54:52.080 --> 54:54.457
-Hey, over here!
-Go away! You're not welcome.

54:54.541 --> 54:56.793
Supernatural spirits!

54:56.876 --> 55:00.130
Spirits don't exist!

55:00.213 --> 55:01.089
Sir!

55:01.172 --> 55:02.340
We're here to protest!

55:02.924 --> 55:05.552
Sir, are you sure? Because…

55:06.177 --> 55:09.472
Prepare for injection!

55:09.556 --> 55:10.890
Inject!

55:24.946 --> 55:25.780
Copi…

55:31.161 --> 55:34.205
I failed you, my little girl.

56:05.070 --> 56:06.696
Xico…

56:11.910 --> 56:13.078
Xico…

56:20.043 --> 56:21.336
Xico…

56:26.091 --> 56:27.467
Xico…

56:30.553 --> 56:31.888
Wake up, Xico.

56:34.599 --> 56:37.143
Your journey isn't over.

56:37.227 --> 56:40.939
Hey, I know that voice.

56:41.022 --> 56:43.066
It was me who called you, Xico.

56:43.817 --> 56:46.069
I asked you to come here.

56:46.611 --> 56:48.488
What about Copi? I need to help her!

56:50.323 --> 56:53.076
First, you must help us.

56:53.993 --> 56:57.163
I… I've seen you before.

56:57.831 --> 56:59.124
You're…

57:00.291 --> 57:02.752
Yes, Copi is my daughter.

57:03.545 --> 57:05.463
Lupita!

57:08.341 --> 57:09.717
"Lupita."

57:11.177 --> 57:13.638
It's been so long since I heard my name.

57:14.556 --> 57:17.684
What are you doing here?
Why did you leave?

57:17.767 --> 57:19.352
I didn't leave, Xico.

57:19.436 --> 57:20.895
I never left.

57:21.479 --> 57:26.025
I've been here, as an assurance,
but men always come back.

57:26.818 --> 57:31.322
With their machines and weapons,
with their ingrained ambition,

57:31.406 --> 57:33.450
bringing death and destruction.

57:38.788 --> 57:39.873
Get out of here!

57:40.915 --> 57:42.542
We don't want you here!

57:42.625 --> 57:47.130
Out!

57:47.213 --> 57:48.381
Juan!

57:48.465 --> 57:49.382
No!

57:49.466 --> 57:50.717
Juan!

57:50.800 --> 57:52.051
Lupita…

57:52.552 --> 57:54.304
take care of our little Copi.

58:08.485 --> 58:10.820
This can't happen again.

58:11.571 --> 58:15.158
Men will try to destroy
the mountain again.

58:20.121 --> 58:21.414
I have to go.

58:22.040 --> 58:24.292
For her, for everyone.

58:28.379 --> 58:31.299
I'll stay with you
to protect the mountain.

58:35.261 --> 58:38.181
Copi's dad… Was he killed?

58:38.264 --> 58:40.767
Yes, for defending the mountain.

58:41.935 --> 58:42.769
And now…

58:47.065 --> 58:51.319
All of this happened
because I couldn't find the messenger?

58:51.402 --> 58:52.820
No, Xico.

58:52.904 --> 58:55.782
What you see is the future.

58:55.865 --> 58:59.160
This is what awaits the world
if you don't fulfill your mission.

58:59.744 --> 59:02.789
But I'm just a Xoloitzcuintle dog.

59:02.872 --> 59:05.959
Not even a large dog.
I'm skinny and small.

59:07.418 --> 59:09.963
You're much more than that.

59:14.259 --> 59:15.093
I am?

59:15.176 --> 59:19.430
You must hurry back to Copi and Gus.

59:19.514 --> 59:21.599
But I don't know how to save her.

59:22.392 --> 59:24.143
The tears, Xico.

59:24.644 --> 59:29.482
Above all, remember:
The solution is inside you… within you.

59:32.777 --> 59:36.489
But how will I get all the way up there?

59:45.999 --> 59:49.085
Please, help me save Copi.

59:51.170 --> 59:54.716
-Aren't you coming with me?
-That decision isn't mine to make.

59:54.799 --> 59:55.925
Take care of Copi.

1:00:01.723 --> 1:00:03.516
Always look out for her, Xico.

1:00:38.760 --> 1:00:44.140
We have to hurry before it's too late.
I know a friend who could help us.

1:00:48.561 --> 1:00:51.564
Oh no, bro! That's enough, bro!

1:00:52.231 --> 1:00:54.275
Tlacuache, we need you!

1:00:54.359 --> 1:00:57.278
Xico! You scared me, dude!

1:00:57.362 --> 1:00:59.697
Of course I'll help, dude.
I'm here for you.

1:01:42.281 --> 1:01:44.909
Hang in there, Copi. Come on.

1:01:44.992 --> 1:01:46.619
Go on, have some water.

1:02:07.890 --> 1:02:10.393
The charges are primed and ready.

1:02:11.352 --> 1:02:13.354
Come on, move those machines!

1:02:13.438 --> 1:02:15.189
Right this way, come on!

1:02:15.690 --> 1:02:16.649
Hurry!

1:02:16.733 --> 1:02:20.486
What are you waiting for? To the right!
To the right! There you go.

1:02:21.863 --> 1:02:22.697
That's it!

1:02:22.780 --> 1:02:25.533
-Hey, keep going. Don't stop!
-Go on!

1:02:51.225 --> 1:02:55.062
Have faith, Carmen.
A miracle can still happen.

1:02:55.980 --> 1:02:58.024
Why are they taking so long?

1:03:00.318 --> 1:03:03.362
You're my biggest disappointment.

1:03:03.905 --> 1:03:05.740
I want you to know that.

1:03:17.543 --> 1:03:20.922
For our mountain!

1:03:21.005 --> 1:03:22.006
Yes!

1:03:23.883 --> 1:03:25.676
There will be a reckoning!

1:03:30.556 --> 1:03:35.561
Copi needs you. Xappan poisoned her.
We have Ahuehuete's tears.

1:03:36.854 --> 1:03:39.482
Look, the mountain is dying.

1:03:54.580 --> 1:03:55.581
Xico.

1:04:02.046 --> 1:04:04.257
The tears, quick!

1:04:04.841 --> 1:04:06.050
Yes, here they are.

1:04:14.684 --> 1:04:15.643
What now?

1:04:20.106 --> 1:04:23.234
Wait. The key ingredient.

1:05:17.204 --> 1:05:18.080
Xico?

1:05:20.583 --> 1:05:22.668
Copi, you're okay!

1:05:23.210 --> 1:05:24.211
Yeah!

1:05:50.738 --> 1:05:54.283
More acid!

1:06:01.791 --> 1:06:03.668
You survived.

1:06:03.751 --> 1:06:07.463
Now, I'll finish all of you!

1:06:52.008 --> 1:06:52.967
Xico!

1:07:13.320 --> 1:07:14.155
No!

1:07:37.887 --> 1:07:38.971
Blue Buck!

1:07:39.555 --> 1:07:41.724
It's too late, isn't it, bro?

1:07:44.185 --> 1:07:45.019
No.

1:07:46.645 --> 1:07:48.105
It's not too late yet.

1:07:49.315 --> 1:07:52.485
We can still find the messenger.

1:07:52.568 --> 1:07:55.613
We did all we could to find him.

1:07:55.696 --> 1:07:58.407
And we didn't find my mom either.

1:07:59.742 --> 1:08:01.619
We failed at everything.

1:08:02.870 --> 1:08:06.373
Finding the messenger wasn't the mission.

1:08:06.957 --> 1:08:12.838
You had to accompany him
on his journey to find himself.

1:08:13.422 --> 1:08:14.298
Me?

1:08:14.381 --> 1:08:18.803
Take your rightful place
in this story, Xico,

1:08:18.886 --> 1:08:20.805
and complete your mission.

1:09:01.887 --> 1:09:04.431
The stones, now! It's time!

1:09:28.247 --> 1:09:32.376
They did it!

1:09:32.459 --> 1:09:34.837
They did it, Mr. Old Man!

1:09:35.421 --> 1:09:37.548
Nature is reacting!

1:09:37.631 --> 1:09:38.591
The mountain…

1:09:40.634 --> 1:09:42.344
Kill them!

1:10:07.578 --> 1:10:08.412
Run!

1:11:30.828 --> 1:11:33.914
Don't you dare run away, underlings!
Come back!

1:11:35.457 --> 1:11:37.501
Where do you think you're going?

1:11:37.584 --> 1:11:40.754
I pay you good money for this!

1:11:47.386 --> 1:11:49.888
Get back here right now!

1:11:50.431 --> 1:11:52.141
What is this?

1:11:53.183 --> 1:11:54.643
What's happening?

1:11:54.727 --> 1:11:57.563
Let me go! I'm a very important man!

1:11:57.646 --> 1:11:59.982
Very important.

1:12:00.065 --> 1:12:01.317
Insect!

1:12:01.400 --> 1:12:03.110
You insects!

1:12:03.193 --> 1:12:04.987
-I'm a millionai--
-No!

1:12:20.085 --> 1:12:22.212
Die, you cursed mountain!

1:12:22.755 --> 1:12:24.381
You can't beat me!

1:12:30.637 --> 1:12:32.431
Lousy villagers!

1:12:32.514 --> 1:12:39.355
I know no fear,
which is what makes me powerful.

1:12:43.275 --> 1:12:44.651
Take cover!

1:12:47.321 --> 1:12:49.073
No!

1:13:24.608 --> 1:13:30.197
Today, mankind has once again
threatened our delicate balance.

1:13:30.280 --> 1:13:35.828
A few of the bravest heroes
acted to interfere and saved us.

1:13:36.495 --> 1:13:40.582
We must honor the courage
of these young ones.

1:13:42.835 --> 1:13:44.002
Nana Petra!

1:13:45.671 --> 1:13:46.672
Copi!

1:13:53.429 --> 1:13:57.266
Those who behaved badly
received their punishment.

1:13:57.349 --> 1:14:01.145
Those who acted bravely
will reap the rewards.

1:14:01.228 --> 1:14:04.815
And we've all learned a lesson.

1:14:07.359 --> 1:14:11.488
Only one person
has not paid for his wrongdoing.

1:14:12.072 --> 1:14:14.158
You betrayed your own people

1:14:14.241 --> 1:14:16.994
and the land
that has fed and sheltered you.

1:14:17.077 --> 1:14:19.496
Your son deserves a punishment.

1:14:19.580 --> 1:14:21.248
Sir, please don't.

1:14:21.331 --> 1:14:23.000
He has betrayed you.

1:14:23.083 --> 1:14:25.794
You, guardian of the stones.

1:14:25.878 --> 1:14:27.880
The failure is mine,

1:14:27.963 --> 1:14:31.550
for I did not teach my son
to do the right thing.

1:15:02.581 --> 1:15:04.082
Lupita?

1:15:07.044 --> 1:15:07.878
Mom?

1:15:11.507 --> 1:15:12.549
Mommy!

1:15:15.010 --> 1:15:15.844
Xico.

1:15:17.095 --> 1:15:21.058
Come, take your place
and shine as you deserve.

1:15:21.767 --> 1:15:22.601
Come.

1:15:28.565 --> 1:15:29.525
Xico!

1:15:30.067 --> 1:15:32.027
Come here, buddy.

1:15:35.822 --> 1:15:37.616
I proudly say to you,

1:15:37.699 --> 1:15:39.952
you have triumphed, sweet Xico.

1:15:40.452 --> 1:15:44.206
It is true that love and friendship
always defeat evil schemes.

1:15:46.041 --> 1:15:47.042
They did it!

1:16:02.307 --> 1:16:07.479
He who listens to nature
learns to see in darkness.

1:16:07.563 --> 1:16:11.483
And he who can see in darkness

1:16:11.567 --> 1:16:14.528
will find his way to the light.

1:16:35.340 --> 1:16:39.052
Xolo, Xolo, Xoloitzcuintle
Xico, Xico, Mexico

1:16:39.136 --> 1:16:42.806
We share this land you and I have

1:16:42.889 --> 1:16:46.560
Xolo, Xolo, Xoloitzcuintle
Xico, Xico, Mexico

1:16:46.643 --> 1:16:50.314
Wherever you go
You'll bring a seed of peace

1:16:54.276 --> 1:16:57.863
I'll tell you a magical story

1:16:57.946 --> 1:17:01.658
About a dog that was a pet in Aztec times

1:17:01.742 --> 1:17:05.412
Since then, he's been
A faithful, inseparable friend

1:17:05.495 --> 1:17:08.749
Beyond this life, he guided us

1:17:09.249 --> 1:17:12.961
And throughout time, his spirit

1:17:13.045 --> 1:17:16.757
Has accompanied our people

1:17:16.840 --> 1:17:20.344
That's why he's here for you

1:17:20.427 --> 1:17:24.097
To have fun, to imagine

1:17:24.181 --> 1:17:27.934
Xolo, Xolo, Xoloitzcuintle
Xico, Xico, Mexico

1:17:28.018 --> 1:17:31.605
He likes to cross borders
He fills our hearts with joy

1:17:31.688 --> 1:17:35.400
Xolo, Xolo, Xoloitzcuintle
Xico, Xico, Mexico

1:17:35.484 --> 1:17:39.112
Takes our ideas to the rest of the world

1:17:39.196 --> 1:17:42.908
Xolo, Xolo, Xoloitzcuintle
Xico, Xico, Mexico

1:17:42.991 --> 1:17:46.620
We share this land you and I have

1:17:46.703 --> 1:17:50.374
Xolo, Xolo, Xoloitzcuintle
Xico, Xico, Mexico

1:17:50.457 --> 1:17:54.169
Wherever you go
You'll bring a seed of peace

1:18:01.843 --> 1:18:05.389
I'll tell you a magical story

1:18:05.472 --> 1:18:09.142
About a dog that was a pet in Aztec times

1:18:09.226 --> 1:18:13.021
And throughout time, his spirit

1:18:13.105 --> 1:18:16.817
Has accompanied our people

1:18:16.900 --> 1:18:20.404
That's why he's here for you

1:18:20.487 --> 1:18:22.239
To have fun…

1:22:53.677 --> 1:22:54.594
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

1:22:54.678 --> 1:22:57.389
We thank Mother Earth
