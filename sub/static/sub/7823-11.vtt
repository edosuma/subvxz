01:29.900 --> 01:31.470
FROGGIE, I'M HOME!

01:38.110 --> 01:39.610
HI, LITTLE FELLA.

01:39.680 --> 01:41.380
GOT SOME NICE,
JUICY FLIES FOR YOU.

01:42.650 --> 01:43.590
GEEZ, LOUISE!

01:43.650 --> 01:45.320
LOOK AT THIS MESS!

01:45.380 --> 01:47.310
I TOLD THAT BOY A BILLION TIMES

01:47.390 --> 01:48.590
TO PICK UP HIS JU...

01:48.650 --> 01:50.150
DAMN!

01:50.220 --> 01:52.250
SON-OF-A-..!

01:52.320 --> 01:54.620
doll repeatedly:
I like to play
with you.

01:54.690 --> 01:55.820
( <i>groans )</i>

01:55.890 --> 01:57.160
MY BACK.

01:57.230 --> 01:59.500
THERE GOES MY BACK AGAIN.

( <i>grunting )</i>

02:02.170 --> 02:03.640
( <i>grunting )</i>

02:03.700 --> 02:04.730
D-OH!

02:04.800 --> 02:07.670
GO GET HELP, BOY.

02:11.540 --> 02:14.910
( <i>doll voice weakened by time )
I like to play with you.</i>

02:14.980 --> 02:17.150
( <i>grunts )</i>

02:17.220 --> 02:20.020
OH, MAGGIE, MY POOR BACK.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.420
( <i>doll voice barely audible )</i>

02:28.830 --> 02:29.430
( <i>gasping )</i>

02:29.500 --> 02:30.300
DAD!

02:30.360 --> 02:32.690
HOMER, WHAT HAPPENED?!

02:32.770 --> 02:34.700
THE BOY.

02:34.770 --> 02:36.640
BRING ME THE BOY.

02:36.700 --> 02:39.070
BART, IF YOU HAD
CLEANED YOUR ROOM
WHEN I ASKED YOU TO

02:39.140 --> 02:42.380
YOUR FATHER'S TRICK BACK
WOULD STILL BE ALIGNED.

02:42.440 --> 02:44.980
SO YOU PICK UP THIS MESS
RIGHT NOW!

02:46.180 --> 02:47.580
CLUMSY HOMER.

02:47.650 --> 02:50.050
EVERYTHING'S ALWAYS MY FAULT.

02:50.120 --> 02:53.320
IF HE'D JUST WATCH
WHERE HE WAS GOING...

02:53.390 --> 02:54.390
HELLO.

02:54.450 --> 02:55.980
WHAT HAVE WE HERE?

02:56.050 --> 02:58.020
A CHERRY BOMB!

02:58.090 --> 03:00.160
I THOUGHT I BLEW
ALL YOU GUYS UP.

03:02.260 --> 03:03.770
PEOPLE, PEOPLE!

03:03.830 --> 03:05.600
NO ROUGHHOUSING
ON THE MONKEY BARS.

03:05.660 --> 03:07.130
YOU THERE.
TUCK IN YOUR SHIRT.

03:07.200 --> 03:09.040
WATCH IT, I SAW THAT.

03:09.100 --> 03:12.770
YOU HAVE CERTAINLY HAVE DONE
AWFULLY WELL FOR YOURSELF,
SPANKY.

03:12.840 --> 03:15.010
MOTHER, DON'T
CALL ME SPANKY

03:15.070 --> 03:16.300
ON SCHOOL GROUNDS.

03:16.380 --> 03:17.710
WOW!
A CHERRY BOMB.

03:17.780 --> 03:19.680
WHAT WILL YOU
DO WITH IT, BART?

03:19.750 --> 03:21.080
WATCH OUT-- IT'S SKINNER.

03:21.150 --> 03:21.950
UH-OH.

03:23.150 --> 03:25.550
<i>GOOD MORNING,
MR. SKINNER!</i>

03:25.620 --> 03:26.690
MORNING, BOYS.

03:26.750 --> 03:28.790
WHY HAVEN'T YOU
INTRODUCED ME

03:28.850 --> 03:30.880
TO ANY OF YOUR STUDENTS, SPANKY?

03:30.960 --> 03:31.860
( <i>giggling )</i>

03:31.920 --> 03:32.880
WELL?

03:32.960 --> 03:34.800
MOTHER,
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET

03:34.860 --> 03:37.470
MILHOUSE, LEWIS, RICHARD

03:37.530 --> 03:39.670
AND.. BART SIMPSON.

03:39.730 --> 03:42.300
THIS IS THE BART SIMPSON
YOU'RE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT?

03:42.370 --> 03:43.340
MM-HMM.

03:43.400 --> 03:44.970
BUT HE LOOKS SO SWEET.

03:45.040 --> 03:46.140
I AM, MA'AM.

03:46.210 --> 03:47.580
SIMPSON!
LET'S MOVE ON NOW, MOTHER.

03:47.640 --> 03:48.410
SHALL WE?

03:49.140 --> 03:50.140
BYE, SPANKY.

03:50.210 --> 03:50.880
( <i>giggling )</i>

03:52.280 --> 03:54.120
SO YOU'RE GONNA
FLUSH IT?

03:54.180 --> 03:56.050
WHAT CAN I SAY?
I GOT A WEAKNESS
FOR THE CLASSICS.

03:56.110 --> 04:00.080
I THINK I NEED TO MAKE A
STOP AT THE LITTLE GIRLS' ROOM.

04:00.150 --> 04:02.320
OKAY, MOTHER, THIS WAY.

04:04.020 --> 04:05.450
HAH-HAH-HAH!

04:05.520 --> 04:07.050
SO LONG, SUCKER.

04:07.130 --> 04:09.530
( <i>explosion )</i>

04:09.600 --> 04:10.600
( <i>laughing )</i>

04:10.660 --> 04:12.820
( <i>screaming )</i>

04:12.900 --> 04:14.500
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE...

04:14.570 --> 04:15.670
Mother:
<i>SPANKY?</i>

04:15.730 --> 04:16.690
MOTHER?

04:16.769 --> 04:18.470
Homer:
<i>OH, MARGE?</i>

04:18.540 --> 04:19.839
<i>I STILL HURT.</i>

04:19.910 --> 04:21.810
MARGE?!

04:21.870 --> 04:23.030
MARGE!

04:23.110 --> 04:26.680
HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE
TO FLUFF YOUR PILLOW?

04:26.750 --> 04:29.550
ACTUALLY, COULD YOU MAKE ME
A GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH?

04:29.620 --> 04:31.220
WELL, OKAY.

04:31.280 --> 04:33.280
MAKE SURE
IT'S SQUISHED FLAT
AND CRUNCHY OUTSIDE.

04:33.350 --> 04:34.990
I KNOW HOW YOU LIKE 'EM, HOMER.

04:35.050 --> 04:37.580
AND MAYBE SOME OF
THOSE LITTLE WIENERS
THAT COME IN A CAN?

04:37.660 --> 04:40.730
AND SOME FRUIT COCKTAIL
IN HEAVY SYRUP.

04:40.790 --> 04:41.620
( <i>growls )</i>

04:44.330 --> 04:46.570
Homer:
MARGE?

04:46.630 --> 04:48.400
MARGE?!

04:48.470 --> 04:49.740
MARGE!!

04:49.800 --> 04:51.340
GET THE DOOR!

04:51.400 --> 04:52.100
( <i>growls )</i>

04:54.710 --> 04:57.350
PRINCIPAL SKINNER!

04:57.410 --> 04:59.380
HELLO MRS. SIMPSON.
I'M AFRAID THERE'S BEEN

04:59.440 --> 05:00.910
A VERY DISTURBING INCIDENT
AT SCHOOL TODAY.

05:00.980 --> 05:03.150
I'M OUT OF HERE, MAN.

05:03.220 --> 05:05.020
PRINCIPAL SKINNER'S HERE.

05:05.080 --> 05:06.980
HELLO,
PRINCIPAL SKINNER.

05:07.050 --> 05:08.910
I'D GET UP,
BUT THE BOY CRIPPLED ME.

05:08.990 --> 05:11.090
I UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY.

05:11.160 --> 05:13.490
THE DISTURBING INCIDENT
HAPPENED THIS MORNING,
WHEN YOUR SON

05:13.560 --> 05:16.860
FLUSHED AN EXPLOSIVE DEVICE
DOWN THE BOYS LAVATORY.

05:16.930 --> 05:18.600
THAT OLD GAG.

05:18.660 --> 05:20.760
UNFORTUNATELY, AT THE SAME
MOMENT, MY MOTHER WAS IN
THE GIRLS LAVATORY

05:20.830 --> 05:22.490
MAKING USE OF THE FACILITIES.

05:22.570 --> 05:23.370
OH, DEAR.

05:23.440 --> 05:24.810
MR. AND MRS. SIMPSON

05:24.870 --> 05:26.840
WE'VE TRANSCENDED
INCORRIGIBLE.

05:26.910 --> 05:29.810
I DON'T THINK SUSPENSION
OR EXPULSION WILL DO THE TRICK.

05:29.880 --> 05:32.010
I THINK IT BEHOOVES US ALL
TO CONSIDER...

05:32.080 --> 05:33.180
DEPORTATION.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.420
DEPORTATION?

05:34.480 --> 05:36.750
KICK BART OUT
OF THE COUNTRY?

05:36.820 --> 05:38.450
HEAR HIM OUT, MARGE.

05:38.520 --> 05:40.720
PERHAPS I WAS BEING A TAD GLIB.

05:40.790 --> 05:42.090
LET ME EXPLAIN.

05:42.150 --> 05:45.420
OUR SCHOOL PARTICIPATES IN
A FOREIGN EXCHANGE PROGRAM.

05:45.490 --> 05:47.630
NORMALLY, A STUDENT IS SELECTED
ON THE BASIS OF

05:47.690 --> 05:49.620
ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE
OR INTELLIGENCE

05:49.700 --> 05:51.030
BUT IN BART'S CASE

05:51.100 --> 05:53.300
I'M PREPARED
TO MAKE A BIG EXCEPTION.

05:53.370 --> 05:54.870
AND IF YOU'RE WILLING
TO PLAY ALONG

05:54.930 --> 05:56.890
HE CAN SPEND
THE NEXT THREE MONTHS

05:56.970 --> 05:58.740
STUDYING FAR, FAR AWAY.

05:58.800 --> 05:59.800
SOUNDS GREAT!

05:59.870 --> 06:01.310
ALTHOUGH A KID
CAN'T LEARN MUCH

06:01.370 --> 06:02.700
IN JUST THREE MONTHS.

06:02.770 --> 06:05.140
YOU DIDN'T EVEN ASK
WHERE BART WOULD BE GOING.

06:05.210 --> 06:07.650
ACTUALLY, HE'D BE STAYING
IN FRANCE IN A LOVELY CHATEAU

06:07.710 --> 06:09.270
IN THE HEART OF THE
WINE COUNTRY.

06:09.350 --> 06:11.020
BART DOESN'T SPEAK FRENCH.

06:11.080 --> 06:12.680
OH, WHEN HE IS TOTALLY IMMERSED
IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE,

06:12.750 --> 06:14.490
THE AVERAGE CHILD
CAN BECOME FLUENT IN WEEKS.

06:14.550 --> 06:15.610
YEAH, BUT WHAT ABOUT BART?

06:15.690 --> 06:17.790
HE'LL PICK UP ENOUGH TO GET BY.

06:17.860 --> 06:19.730
THE WHOLE THING
WON'T COST YOU A DIME

06:19.790 --> 06:21.730
AS LONG AS YOU'RE WILLING
TO TAKE IN A STUDENT
OF YOUR OWN.

06:21.790 --> 06:23.020
WAIT A MINUTE, SKINNER.

06:23.100 --> 06:25.530
HOW DO WE KNOW
SOME PRINCIPAL OVER IN FRANCE

06:25.600 --> 06:28.140
ISN'T PULLING THE SAME SCAM
YOU ARE?

06:28.200 --> 06:30.140
FOR ONE THING,
YOU WOULDN'T BE GETTING
A FRENCH BOY.

06:30.200 --> 06:31.710
YOU WOULD BE GETTING
AN ALBANIAN.

06:31.770 --> 06:33.540
YOU MEAN ALL WHITE
WITH PINK EYES?

06:33.610 --> 06:35.710
NO, NO, NO.
A STUDENT FROM ALBANIA.

06:35.770 --> 06:38.040
IT'S A COUNTRY ON
THE ADRIATIC SEA.

06:38.110 --> 06:40.920
WELL, GOING TO FRANCE
SOUNDS LIKE A FANTASTIC
OPPORTUNITY.

06:40.980 --> 06:43.150
BUT I THINK BART
SHOULD HAVE A SAY IN THIS.

06:43.220 --> 06:44.820
THE LIFE OF A FROG.

06:44.880 --> 06:46.780
THAT'S THE LIFE FOR ME.

06:46.850 --> 06:50.560
BART, HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO SPEND THE NEXT THREE MONTHS

06:50.620 --> 06:52.420
LIVING IN FRANCE?

06:52.490 --> 06:53.930
FRANCE?

06:53.990 --> 06:55.450
WOW!

06:55.530 --> 06:58.030
HE MAKES <i>ME CRAZY
12 MONTHS A YEAR.</i>

06:58.100 --> 07:00.170
AT LEAST YOU GET
THE SUMMER OFF.

07:00.230 --> 07:02.240
I'D GET TO TAKE A PLANE
THERE, WOULDN'T I, MOM?

07:02.300 --> 07:03.200
YES, BART.

07:03.270 --> 07:04.240
WOW. AND ONE BACK?

07:04.300 --> 07:05.430
MM-HMM.

07:05.500 --> 07:09.130
BART SEEMS VERY ENTHUSIASTIC
ABOUT THE IDEA.

07:09.210 --> 07:10.080
YES!
YES!

07:10.140 --> 07:11.110
BABY!

07:11.180 --> 07:12.210
WAY TO GO!

07:12.280 --> 07:13.710
BON VOYAGE, BOY!

07:18.850 --> 07:21.760
GOOD-BYE,
MY SPECIAL, LITTLE GUY.

07:21.820 --> 07:23.820
YOU WILL WRITE US,
WON'T YOU?

07:23.890 --> 07:24.830
ALL THE TIME.

07:24.890 --> 07:26.630
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT FRANCE?

07:26.690 --> 07:27.760
I'M GOING
AND YOU'RE NOT.

07:27.830 --> 07:29.460
I'LL MISS YOU, SON.

07:29.530 --> 07:32.500
AND LISTEN, WHILE YOU'RE
SEEING ALL THOSE
GREAT SIGHTS,

07:32.560 --> 07:36.290
ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT YOU'RE
REPRESENTING YOUR COUNTRY.

07:36.370 --> 07:37.940
I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS

07:38.000 --> 07:39.130
DON'T MESS UP FRANCE

07:39.200 --> 07:40.300
THE WAY YOU MESSED UP
YOUR ROOM.

07:40.370 --> 07:41.710
OKAY, DAD.

07:41.770 --> 07:43.900
IS ONE OF YOU GOING TO BE
ON THE CHARTER FLIGHT?

07:43.980 --> 07:45.880
- YES, SIR.
- MM-HMM. COME ALONG.

07:45.940 --> 07:47.840
BYE.
BYE, BART.
BE GOOD.

07:49.080 --> 07:49.880
UMPH!

07:57.820 --> 08:00.850
( <i>speaking Albanian )</i>

08:01.990 --> 08:06.790
( <i>speaking Albanian )</i>

08:21.780 --> 08:23.480
HEY, MAN, WATCH IT!

08:27.290 --> 08:28.320
OH!

08:28.390 --> 08:30.630
HEY, MAN, IT'S ME, BART SIMPSON.

08:30.690 --> 08:32.760
- OKAY, KID, LET'S GO.
- HEY!

08:32.820 --> 08:35.419
Bart:
♪ EVERY LITTLE BREEZE
SEEMS TO WHISPER LOUISE ♪

08:35.490 --> 08:39.659
♪ BIRDS IN THE TREES

♪ LA-LA-LA-LA, LA-LA-LA-LA... ♪

08:42.429 --> 08:43.429
OOH-LA-LA!

08:43.500 --> 08:45.410
HOW MUCH LONGER, SIR?

08:45.470 --> 08:47.840
THIS IS WHERE
WE'RE GOING, RIGHT?

08:47.910 --> 08:50.380
"SHAT-OH MAH-SUN?"

09:01.750 --> 09:03.950
EW, WHAT A DUMP!

09:05.960 --> 09:10.800
Lisa:
YOU KNOW, IN ALBANIA
THE UNIT OF CURRENCY IS CALLED

09:10.860 --> 09:11.890
THE <i>LEK.</i>

09:11.960 --> 09:14.330
YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING!
THE LEK.

09:14.400 --> 09:15.500
AND THE NATIONAL FLAG

09:15.570 --> 09:17.200
IS A TWO-HEADED EAGLE
ON A RED FIELD.

09:17.270 --> 09:19.670
GIVE ME THE OLD
STARS AND STRIPES.

09:19.740 --> 09:22.340
AND THE MAIN EXPORT IS
FURIOUS POLITICAL THOUGHT.

09:22.410 --> 09:23.780
POLITICAL WHAT?

09:23.840 --> 09:25.750
P.A.:
Trans Albanian Airlines
Flight number 2

09:25.810 --> 09:27.210
is now arriving.

09:27.280 --> 09:29.380
Man:
WELCOME TO YOUR NEW HOME.

09:29.450 --> 09:30.790
ESCAPE IS IMPOSSIBLE.

09:30.850 --> 09:32.220
MY NAME
IS CESAR.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.980
THIS IS MY NEPHEW,
UGOLIN.

09:34.050 --> 09:36.410
YOU MAY FIND LIFE HERE
AT THE CHATEAU HARD

09:36.490 --> 09:39.190
BUT IF YOU SHUT UP
AND DO EXACTLY WHAT WE SAY

09:39.260 --> 09:41.230
THE TIME WILL PASS
MORE QUICKLY.

09:41.290 --> 09:42.920
HE'S RIGHT, YOU KNOW.

09:42.990 --> 09:44.460
WELL, OKAY, SIR.

09:47.900 --> 09:48.670
ADIL?

09:48.730 --> 09:50.560
MOTHER?

09:50.640 --> 09:53.370
WELL, I GUESS FOR
THE NEXT FEW MONTHS, YES.
I WILL BE YOUR MOTHER.

09:53.440 --> 09:55.780
AND THIS MUST BE LISA

09:55.840 --> 09:57.180
AND MAGGIE

09:57.240 --> 09:59.780
AND YOU MUST BE
MY NEW FATHER, HOMER.

10:01.280 --> 10:03.750
AFFECTIONATE LITTLE ALBANIAN,
ISN'T HE?

10:15.930 --> 10:17.470
HEY C'MON GUYS.
QUIT BEING SO GRABBY.

10:17.530 --> 10:18.700
( <i>growling )</i>

10:18.760 --> 10:19.690
SORRY, MAN.

10:19.760 --> 10:21.160
BE MY GUEST.

10:21.230 --> 10:24.230
Principal:
YOU MAY FIND HIS ACCENT
PECULIAR.

10:24.300 --> 10:26.300
CERTAIN ASPECTS OF HIS CULTURE
MAY SEEM...ABSURD..

10:26.370 --> 10:28.910
OR OBSCENE AND OFFENSIVE...

10:28.970 --> 10:31.000
BUT I URGE YOU ALL
TO GIVE LITTLE ADIL

10:31.080 --> 10:32.980
THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.

10:33.040 --> 10:34.340
IN THIS WAY,

ALTHOUGH I HAVE ONLY BEEN
IN YOUR COUNTRY
A FEW DAYS

10:47.960 --> 10:50.360
I HAVE ALREADY FOUND AMERICANS

TO BE MOST TRUSTING.

10:52.060 --> 10:53.620
ALTHOUGH OFFICIALLY

10:53.700 --> 10:55.570
I AM REQUIRED TO HATE YOU

I WANT YOU TO KNOW,
I DO NOT FEEL IT IN MY HEART.

WHERE FIVE PERCENT
OF THE PEOPLE

11:19.020 --> 11:21.120
CONTROL 95% OF THE WEALTH?

11:21.190 --> 11:22.690
I'M DEFENDING A COUNTRY

11:22.760 --> 11:24.930
WHERE PEOPLE CAN THINK,
ACT AND WORSHIP
ANY WAY THEY WANT.

11:25.000 --> 11:25.600

CAN, TOO.

11:27.500 --> 11:28.900
PLEASE KIDS.

11:28.970 --> 11:30.470
STOP FIGHTING.

11:30.540 --> 11:33.210
MAYBE LISA'S RIGHT
ABOUT AMERICA

11:33.270 --> 11:35.010
BEING THE LAND OF OPPORTUNITY,
AND MAYBE ADIL

11:35.070 --> 11:36.970
HAS A POINT ABOUT THE MACHINERY
OF CAPITALISM

11:37.040 --> 11:38.650
BEING OILED WITH THE BLOOD
OF THE WORKERS.

11:38.710 --> 11:40.350
YOUR FATHER IS RIGHT.

11:40.410 --> 11:42.120
WE SHOULD NOT FIGHT.

11:42.180 --> 11:43.220

11:43.280 --> 11:44.720
WELL, OKAY.

YOU KNOW, MARGE.
THIS IS THE WAY

11:57.230 --> 11:58.500
I'VE ALWAYS
WANTED IT TO BE.

WE'VE ALWAYS
BLAMED OURSELVES

12:14.510 --> 12:16.140
SHE'LL GET OVER IT.

IF SHE DOESN'T,
WE CAN ALWAYS EXCHANGE HER.

YES, THANK YOU, FATHER.

12:55.720 --> 12:57.660
YOU CAN CALL ME "DAD."

12:57.720 --> 12:59.650
ALL RIGHT, DAD.

12:59.720 --> 13:02.290
AW, YOU CALLED ME DAD.

13:02.360 --> 13:06.400
DAD, DO YOU THINK I COULD
COME VISIT YOU AT THE
NUCLEAR POWER PLANT?

13:06.460 --> 13:07.590
YOU WANT TO SEE WHERE I WORK?

13:07.670 --> 13:09.100
OH YES, VERY MUCH.

13:09.170 --> 13:12.440
NONE OF MY BIOLOGICAL KIDS
EVER WANTED TO SEE ME AT WORK.

13:12.500 --> 13:13.930
THEN, I CAN GO?

13:14.010 --> 13:16.840
I'LL HAVE TO PULL STRINGS
WITH THE BOYS IN SECURITY

13:16.910 --> 13:18.510
BUT SURE, YOU BET.

13:18.580 --> 13:20.980
EXCELLENT.

13:21.050 --> 13:22.620

13:24.380 --> 13:26.580
BETWEEN YOUR THUMB

13:26.650 --> 13:28.660
AND GENTLY TWIST IT OFF

13:28.720 --> 13:30.560
AND DROP IT
IN THE BUCKET.

13:30.620 --> 13:32.290
NOW YOU DO IT.
