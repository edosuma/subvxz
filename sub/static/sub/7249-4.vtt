00:02.294 --> 00:04.003
Previously on Gilmore Girls:

00:04.086 --> 00:06.548
Max has asked me to marry him.

00:06.632 --> 00:07.674
Yeah, I figured.

00:09.301 --> 00:10.511
Goodness.

00:11.345 --> 00:14.014
- You should elope and get it over with.
- No one asked you.

00:14.097 --> 00:15.641
My parents are sending me to Korea.

00:15.724 --> 00:18.101
Guess who doesn't possess
his own set of keys yet.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.311
I'm guessing it's you.

00:19.478 --> 00:21.855
They won't tell me when I'm coming back.

00:21.939 --> 00:24.900
I'm trying really hard
not to read too much into this.

00:24.983 --> 00:26.318
I just thought you should know.

00:26.401 --> 00:29.655
My parents brought the suitcase
that I'm supposed to take on my trip.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.990
- We're getting married, Lorelai.
- I know.

00:32.031 --> 00:35.327
That means we're taking two separate
lives and melding them together.

00:35.410 --> 00:37.955
- How do you think that's going to work?
- I don't know.

00:38.038 --> 00:41.375
- Have you given it any thought at all?
- Not really.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.919
People can evolve together,
don't you think?

00:44.002 --> 00:45.003
Maybe.

00:45.212 --> 00:46.672
- Pack.
- What?

00:46.713 --> 00:48.799
- Pack.
- What's going on?

00:48.882 --> 00:50.300
We are hitting the road.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.719
- Are you and Max getting married?
- No.

00:52.803 --> 00:54.763
So, are we almost there?

00:54.847 --> 00:58.350
We're almost there and nowhere near it.
All that matters is we're going.

00:58.433 --> 01:01.144
- Practically gone already.
- Look out, world.

01:04.815 --> 01:07.818
No music.
I can't believe we forgot to bring tunes.

01:07.901 --> 01:10.904
Do you realize neither of us
has the vaguest idea where we are?

01:10.988 --> 01:14.575
- What is a road trip without tunes?
- The sun is directly behind us.

01:14.658 --> 01:18.245
I've never been in this car for a long period
of time without playing AC/DC.

01:18.328 --> 01:20.831
- I don't know where it's going.
- I need Highway to Hell.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.124
It's right out the windshield.

01:22.207 --> 01:24.459
The radio's only playing Top 40
and Christian rock.

01:24.543 --> 01:27.754
'Christian rock. ' There's an oxymoron.
I need my tunes!

01:27.838 --> 01:31.216
- Stop complaining about the tunes.
- Stop complaining about our location.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.635
My complaint is legitimate.
Yours is infantile.

01:33.719 --> 01:35.053
Okay, you're right.

01:35.137 --> 01:36.847
Nonstop Country...

01:38.390 --> 01:41.226
Yes, country music. Must be my lucky day.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.896
- We have to figure out where we're going.
- No, we don't.

01:43.937 --> 01:46.648
- Mom.
- The point of this is to be spontaneous...

01:46.732 --> 01:50.861
to drive and land someplace we've
never been and never expected to be.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.738
- Sounds risky.
- Sounds exciting.

01:52.821 --> 01:54.573
Serendipity has never been kind to us.

01:54.656 --> 01:57.451
Yes, but I talked to Serendipity
on the phone last night.

01:57.534 --> 02:00.037
She feels bad
about how she's treated us in the past.

02:00.120 --> 02:03.415
We had a nice chat.
It's all gonna be different now.

02:03.457 --> 02:06.960
What did that sign say?
It said 'Don't' or 'Death' on it.

02:07.044 --> 02:09.045
- Relax.
- We're doomed.

02:09.128 --> 02:12.925
- Wrong. We're being guided by fate.
- I think we're lost.

02:13.008 --> 02:15.385
We can't be lost.
We don't know where we're going.

02:15.469 --> 02:18.305
You're going to stop
before we drive into the Atlantic Ocean?

02:18.388 --> 02:20.891
- I'll try.
- At least we'll know where we are.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.935
Unless it's the Pacific.

02:25.479 --> 02:29.483
Coming up, a three-song superset
from Hootie & the Blowfish.

02:31.000 --> 02:37.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:28.584 --> 03:31.503
- You know what? I love road food.
- I love it, too.

03:31.587 --> 03:34.339
What could be better
than the food at Haden's Nut House?

03:34.381 --> 03:37.217
- Unless you don't like nuts.
- As if those people exist.

03:37.301 --> 03:39.344
If I was in a rock band, touring and stuff...

03:39.428 --> 03:42.264
I'd make the driver stop
at every Haden's Nut House we passed.

03:42.347 --> 03:45.267
Wow, your Behind the Music
is gonna be really wild.

03:45.767 --> 03:48.812
Okay, so if we continue
on the way we've been going...

03:48.896 --> 03:50.564
- Who are you calling?
- Sookie.

03:50.647 --> 03:51.732
Now?

03:51.815 --> 03:55.319
I didn't get to call her before we left,
so she doesn't know about the...

03:56.653 --> 03:59.656
- You okay?
- I guess. It's just...

04:00.073 --> 04:01.450
Hi, Sookie, it's me.

04:01.617 --> 04:03.660
Hi, sweetie. You on your way in?

04:03.744 --> 04:05.245
No, not yet.

04:05.329 --> 04:08.457
Actually, I'm gonna be out of town
for a couple of days.

04:08.707 --> 04:11.251
- What?
- Yeah, Rory and I decided to hit the road.

04:11.335 --> 04:14.046
But how can you do that?
You're supposed to be getting...

04:14.129 --> 04:17.507
- The engagement is off, Sookie.
- What? What happened?

04:17.591 --> 04:19.510
It's a long story.

04:19.593 --> 04:23.722
I don't really want to go into all the whats
and whys and gory details right now...

04:23.764 --> 04:27.226
but you should know we all still love Max.
To figure out what happened...

04:27.309 --> 04:30.229
you'd have to dig up Freud
and have him work on me full-time.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.773
- Honey, I'm so sorry.
- Thanks.

04:32.940 --> 04:36.568
So, I hope you didn't get too far
on that cake.

04:36.610 --> 04:40.864
No, that's one thing
you can be thankful about.

04:41.073 --> 04:42.783
You caught me in plenty of time.

04:42.866 --> 04:45.577
Good. I know the kind of work
you were gonna put into it.

04:45.619 --> 04:49.581
I would've killed myself if you'd
gone to all that craziness for nothing.

04:49.665 --> 04:53.585
I've been so busy lately,
I actually forgot about it.

04:53.627 --> 04:57.422
Listen, do me a favor. Mention canceling
the wedding to Miss Patty, will you?

04:57.464 --> 04:59.049
That way, by the time we get back...

04:59.132 --> 05:01.301
The whole town will know within the hour.

05:01.385 --> 05:05.264
Hopefully, they will all have chatted it
out of their systems before we get home.

05:05.347 --> 05:07.516
Consider it done. So where are you going?

05:07.599 --> 05:10.310
- We have no idea.
- My favorite kind of trip.

05:10.727 --> 05:14.022
Thanks. I'll talk to you soon.
Call the cell if you need anything.

05:14.106 --> 05:16.275
- Okey-dokey. Bye-bye.
- Bye.

05:17.442 --> 05:21.113
You were a good cake, Clyde.
I never should have named you.

05:23.949 --> 05:25.576
That had better not be a map.

05:25.659 --> 05:28.704
Sorry, but I'm openly defying
your no-map policy.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.915
Mom, it's gonna be dark
in a couple of hours.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.458
I don't want to sleep in the car.

05:33.542 --> 05:36.461
My sense of adventure
did not translate to my offspring.

05:36.545 --> 05:38.505
To the best of my map-reading abilities...

05:38.589 --> 05:40.841
we're headed toward
Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

05:40.924 --> 05:42.467
- Portsmouth?
- What?

05:42.593 --> 05:46.346
I actually have a friend in Portsmouth,
Donald something-or-other-stein.

05:46.430 --> 05:47.848
Close, personal friend?

05:47.931 --> 05:51.518
Donald moved there a couple of years ago
and opened a B & B.

05:51.602 --> 05:54.188
No, it's actually
supposed to be pretty cool.

05:54.271 --> 05:55.480
- A cool B & B?
- Yes.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.983
That's like saying
'an understated Nicolas Cage movie. '

05:58.066 --> 06:01.778
I myself am not usually a fan of B & B,
but Donald's place is different.

06:01.820 --> 06:03.822
- Captain Corelli's Mandolin.
- I'm serious.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.033
'Bella bambina at two o'clock!'

06:06.116 --> 06:09.995
Every room is decorated in a different
weird style from a different century.

06:10.078 --> 06:12.039
- That is kind of cool.
- Okay, let's go.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.332
- Let's call.
- Let's go.

06:13.415 --> 06:15.250
- Let's call.
- Sense of adventure.

06:15.334 --> 06:16.543
Let's go.

06:25.219 --> 06:26.887
- Hello, there.
- Hi.

06:26.970 --> 06:29.473
- Would you like to ring the bell?
- What?

06:29.556 --> 06:32.809
Would you like to ring the bell,
you or your daughter?

06:32.851 --> 06:34.019
I don't understand.

06:34.102 --> 06:36.313
I'm not usually sitting here
when guests arrive...

06:36.396 --> 06:39.024
so people ring the bell,
and they love to ring the bell.

06:39.107 --> 06:41.151
You didn't get to ring the bell.

06:42.277 --> 06:43.612
Well done.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.281
Do you have a room available?

06:46.365 --> 06:48.450
We most certainly do,
you lucky, pretty things.

06:48.534 --> 06:50.786
- See? They have a room.
- Good.

06:50.994 --> 06:52.996
Does Donald happen to be here?

06:53.080 --> 06:56.500
No, I bought this place from Donald
last year. It's my place now.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.669
- I'm Ladawn.
- Hi.

06:58.877 --> 07:02.339
Yes, I noticed it was a little different.
Actually, very different.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.508
- Did you see it before?
- Pictures.

07:04.591 --> 07:07.511
It was wacky, just like Donald.

07:07.719 --> 07:11.181
It was fun, you know,
but just a little too...

07:11.265 --> 07:12.683
It was just too eclectic.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.561
I don't care for eclectic.
I don't think B & Bers do, either.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.771
No, you wouldn't want anything
out of the normal.

07:17.855 --> 07:21.692
Okay, Room Number 3 is all yours.
Welcome to The Cheshire Cat.

07:22.109 --> 07:25.988
Nice name. I'm gonna consult
with my daughter for just one second.

07:28.407 --> 07:31.660
- We must leave this place immediately.
- And sleep where?

07:31.743 --> 07:35.539
- A hollow tree, a riverbank, I don't care.
- Mom, I'm tired and I'm starving.

07:35.622 --> 07:38.709
She's named the place
after an Alice In Wonderland character.

07:38.792 --> 07:42.588
- This is my worst nightmare.
- And dying of exposure in a jeep is mine.

07:43.797 --> 07:44.965
Okay.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.887
Point the way to Room 3.

07:49.928 --> 07:53.765
I'll take you there myself.
Let me just grab your bags.

07:54.391 --> 07:57.311
- We can do that.
- No, you are my guests.

07:57.394 --> 08:01.190
I won't hear of it. There you go.

08:03.275 --> 08:05.777
You want to ring the bell?
You haven't rung the bell.

08:05.861 --> 08:08.530
- Maybe some other time.
- Follow me.

08:13.619 --> 08:15.370
Watch out for Sammy.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.877
That's either Sammy
or the cat that ate Sammy.

08:34.306 --> 08:35.640
What is it, dear?

08:36.517 --> 08:38.519
- There's just a lot...
- A lot of flowers.

08:38.602 --> 08:40.604
- Like a ton of flowers.
- Plethora of flowers.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.648
A load of flowers.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.943
Thank you.
I get so many compliments on this room.

08:46.527 --> 08:49.696
- Are they moving?
- It looks like it, doesn't it?

08:49.780 --> 08:53.867
There's foil in the paper,
and it gives it that illusion. Isn't it terrific?

08:53.992 --> 08:57.454
- Unbelievable.
- B & Bers love a peaceful setting...

08:57.538 --> 09:00.040
so that they can unwind
from their hectic lives.

09:00.123 --> 09:03.335
- What business are you in, dear?
- Me? Publishing.

09:04.169 --> 09:05.796
How interesting!

09:06.296 --> 09:09.758
If you need anything,
you just ring down or come down...

09:09.842 --> 09:11.677
'cause I love company.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.638
I didn't want to forget
to give you our activity list.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.849
Never a dull moment around here.

09:16.932 --> 09:19.184
- Thanks, Ladawn.
- Yes, thank you.

09:20.018 --> 09:22.646
I think we just found the first room
in world history...

09:22.729 --> 09:26.650
that would have made Liberace say,
'Whoa, step back. No one's that gay. '

09:27.734 --> 09:31.363
Look. This is a book
that past guests have written in.

09:32.406 --> 09:34.700
'This room made my soul soar. '

09:35.284 --> 09:39.538
- All right, enough grossness. Let's go eat.
- Food. I'm starving.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.795
- What?
- Dentists.

09:46.879 --> 09:49.798
Boston dentists.
Cocktail hour at The Cheshire Cat.

09:49.882 --> 09:51.717
- So?
- So our exit is blocked.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.886
- Let's just rush past them.
- Too risky.

09:53.969 --> 09:55.012
They're not assassins.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.556
If they catch us,
they'll clamp on us like leeches.

09:57.598 --> 09:59.975
And you know what that means: Chitchat.

10:00.142 --> 10:03.562
Stomach-churning, mind-numbing,
soul-deadening chitchat.

10:03.604 --> 10:06.982
Mom, I'm starving.
I'm going down there. You can stay here.

10:07.399 --> 10:08.734
- You're that hungry?
- Yes.

10:08.775 --> 10:10.694
Hungry enough
to answer a hundred probing...

10:10.777 --> 10:13.280
but only slightly different
from each other questions...

10:13.363 --> 10:16.867
about Chilton, life in a small town,
and your hunky boyfriend?

10:23.624 --> 10:25.667
- I struck gold.
- What is it?

10:25.751 --> 10:27.920
- Certs.
- Let me catch my breath.

10:28.003 --> 10:31.381
I cannot, for the life of me,
remember the last time I bought Certs.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.926
- Which would make those really old.
- Fuzzy.

10:39.389 --> 10:41.850
- Perfect.
- A nice capper to the day.

10:41.934 --> 10:45.979
In three hours, they've participated in
every inane B & B group activity known.

10:46.063 --> 10:48.524
Let's just hope they finish
with a mass suicide.

10:48.607 --> 10:50.067
We get cranky when we're hungry.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.236
Plus, we're above everyone else
on the planet.

10:52.277 --> 10:53.445
Clearly.

10:53.529 --> 10:55.405
- So, what do you want to do?
- I don't know.

10:55.489 --> 10:57.282
We could go to sleep.

10:57.366 --> 10:59.618
- It's 8:23.
- Good Lord!

10:59.660 --> 11:02.037
- I'm not really sleepy.
- Me, neither.

11:02.538 --> 11:04.122
- We could sing.
- Sing?

11:04.206 --> 11:07.125
We could sing Anarchy in the UK
at the top of our lungs.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.920
That would be good. Or we could talk.

11:12.047 --> 11:14.341
- What about?
- I don't know.

11:15.384 --> 11:16.468
Max?

11:17.636 --> 11:18.971
- No.
- Why?

11:19.012 --> 11:20.806
Because I don't want to.

11:21.932 --> 11:23.058
You said we could talk.

11:23.141 --> 11:25.602
I thought you meant about makeup
or something.

11:25.686 --> 11:26.895
When have we ever done that?

11:26.979 --> 11:29.439
Never, that's why I thought
now would be a good time.

11:29.481 --> 11:31.483
- I just need to know...
- Good night, Rory.

11:31.525 --> 11:32.901
- But...
- Good night.

11:35.946 --> 11:38.323
Are you sure that
you're not just running scared?

11:38.365 --> 11:40.617
- Because I think you really love him...
- Enough!

11:40.701 --> 11:43.495
...but you're just freaked out
and don't know what to do.

11:43.537 --> 11:46.623
Because you did this before,
with Max, in fact.

11:46.915 --> 11:48.625
Rory, I don't want to talk about this.

11:48.709 --> 11:51.670
I thought by saying 'enough,'
and turning off the light...

11:51.712 --> 11:53.547
you would get the message.
Apparently not.

11:53.630 --> 11:55.340
The skywriter will be here in a minute.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.467
- I'm asking you a question.
- I'm a grown woman.

11:57.509 --> 11:59.636
Says the woman
with the Hello Kitty waffle iron.

11:59.720 --> 12:03.640
I have the right not to be quizzed on
my social life by my 16-year-old daughter.

12:03.724 --> 12:05.184
I thought I was your best friend.

12:05.225 --> 12:09.188
At a U2 concert, you are.
But now, you're my 16-year-old daughter...

12:09.229 --> 12:11.231
and I do not want to have
this conversation.

12:11.315 --> 12:12.649
- I do.
- Well, tough.

12:12.733 --> 12:16.236
Everything was planned.
Everyone was excited, including you.

12:16.320 --> 12:19.281
- And then, all of a sudden, you're out.
- I changed my mind.

12:19.364 --> 12:23.243
- This is our life that you just tossed off.
- I didn't just toss off anything.

12:23.327 --> 12:25.829
We had plans.
We made space in the closet.

12:25.954 --> 12:29.958
Just because we moved a couple of boxes
isn't reason enough for me to get married.

12:30.042 --> 12:32.211
Max was counting on this.
I was counting on this.

12:32.294 --> 12:35.339
Stop it! We're not gonna have this fight
in a flowery bedroom...

12:35.380 --> 12:37.716
with dentists singing in the background!

12:37.758 --> 12:40.260
- It's too David Lynch.
- I think you love him.

12:40.344 --> 12:43.388
- Rory, go to sleep!
- You love him, and you got scared...

12:43.472 --> 12:46.225
and you ran, but you're really
going to regret it, and soon.

12:47.226 --> 12:48.352
Fine!

12:49.478 --> 12:50.604
Good night.

13:03.575 --> 13:04.868
I'm sure.

13:08.121 --> 13:09.915
I wish I did love him.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.545
You have no idea how much.

13:32.229 --> 13:34.731
- What's with the face?
- They're taller.

13:35.107 --> 13:37.192
- Not this again.
- There's more of them.

13:37.276 --> 13:41.238
Mom, the flowers on the wallpaper
are not growing or reproducing.

13:43.365 --> 13:45.909
Wait, you weren't writing in this thing,
were you?

13:45.993 --> 13:47.786
Maybe some random thoughts.

13:50.372 --> 13:53.208
- 'Satanic forces are at work here. ' Mom.
- What?

13:53.292 --> 13:55.502
What? We cannot write that in here.

13:56.295 --> 13:57.421
Here.

13:57.838 --> 14:01.133
'Sat and forever am at work here. '

14:01.592 --> 14:03.093
That doesn't make any sense.

14:03.177 --> 14:05.596
It doesn't invoke the Dark Prince,
so it's preferable.

14:05.637 --> 14:06.805
Whatever.

14:06.889 --> 14:08.265
- Hey.
- What?

14:08.390 --> 14:10.434
- Last night.
- We're good.

14:10.726 --> 14:11.727
Okay.

14:11.810 --> 14:13.187
- You know what isn't good?
- What?

14:13.270 --> 14:14.855
- I ate the fuzzy Certs.
- Gross.

14:14.938 --> 14:18.483
- They tasted like keys.
- Okay, enough. I have got to eat.

14:18.734 --> 14:22.446
- You think the coast is clear downstairs?
- Let's check the schedule.

14:23.322 --> 14:26.992
'Early morning nature walk: 7:30,
regional history talk: 8:15... '

14:28.243 --> 14:30.204
We're in luck. Breakfast just ended.

14:30.287 --> 14:32.664
The arts-and-crafts workshop
begins in 13 minutes.

14:32.748 --> 14:34.541
- A window.
- Must be when they shower.

14:34.625 --> 14:36.001
Grab your bag!

14:37.586 --> 14:39.004
Go.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.430
Hello, strangers.

14:49.681 --> 14:52.434
We've all been so worried about you two.

14:54.770 --> 14:57.689
- What are you people doing?
- We're watching hummingbirds.

14:57.773 --> 14:59.983
They're still out there,
if you want to scooch in.

15:00.067 --> 15:01.360
They're the darnedest things.

15:01.401 --> 15:04.655
Flap their wings 100 times a second.
It's an engineering marvel.

15:04.696 --> 15:06.281
That was not on the freaking list.

15:06.365 --> 15:08.700
We don't put things like this
on the freaking list...

15:08.742 --> 15:11.829
because the delights of nature
aren't on any time schedule.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.038
Lordy.

15:13.121 --> 15:15.999
So push in some chairs.
We're gonna make some fresh scones.

15:16.083 --> 15:20.128
They're for tea this afternoon. I just
put out the first test batch. Have a taste.

15:20.212 --> 15:23.382
- A taste would not be bad.
- Maybe just a quick taste.

15:25.300 --> 15:29.429
So, Ladawn says you're in publishing.

15:30.222 --> 15:32.349
Publishing? You're in publishing?

15:32.391 --> 15:34.226
- Yes, I am.
- Books?

15:34.309 --> 15:36.562
You should find a field
with less paperwork.

15:36.645 --> 15:37.855
Good one.

15:38.564 --> 15:40.649
You have two. I still have one.

15:40.732 --> 15:42.192
So, publishing?

15:42.651 --> 15:44.236
Yes, I do publish.

15:45.028 --> 15:47.406
Kind of a dry line of work,
not much to talk about.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.575
Nonsense. It's fascinating.

15:49.950 --> 15:52.077
What kind of books do you publish?

15:52.911 --> 15:55.080
Mainly youth-oriented ones.

15:55.164 --> 15:56.915
- Children's books?
- Sure.

15:56.999 --> 15:59.126
- Any that we've heard of?
- Probably not.

15:59.209 --> 16:02.629
No, wait, please give me some titles.
I'll write them down.

16:02.713 --> 16:04.923
And then when I get home,
I'll look them up.

16:05.007 --> 16:07.301
- Do you have your Space Pen?
- Do you have to ask?

16:07.384 --> 16:09.678
- He loves his Space Pen.
- They write underwater.

16:09.761 --> 16:12.097
- Cool.
- What are the titles?

16:13.307 --> 16:15.976
There's Goodnight Spoon...

16:16.059 --> 16:18.770
and The Horse That Wanted To Bark.

16:19.062 --> 16:21.231
I think I've read that to my grandson.

16:21.315 --> 16:23.942
The horse learns to bark, and then he...

16:23.984 --> 16:25.861
What happens at the end?

16:25.944 --> 16:27.154
He dies.

16:28.322 --> 16:32.242
But he learned to bark, though,
so it's actually an upper.

16:33.452 --> 16:36.788
- So, where are your offices?
- They're in the...

16:38.373 --> 16:40.918
The building with the... Over on the road.

16:40.959 --> 16:43.128
Would you guys excuse me
for just a second?

16:43.212 --> 16:45.797
I have to make an important call
concerning publishing.

16:45.881 --> 16:49.218
Fine, that'll give us a chance
to get to know your lovely daughter.

16:49.301 --> 16:52.346
She's so quiet, but we'll change all that.

16:53.889 --> 16:56.767
Mom, you promised not to do
any business while on vacation.

16:56.808 --> 17:00.979
Honey, publishing waits for no man.
Got to keep the presses pressing.

17:03.815 --> 17:05.901
Tell us about your school.

17:08.487 --> 17:09.946
Hey, Sookie, it's me.

17:10.155 --> 17:13.617
- Hey, sweetie, how's the trip going?
- It's fine. Where are you?

17:13.700 --> 17:16.203
Luke's got a nice little show going on here.

17:16.286 --> 17:19.373
- You've been sitting there for two hours.
- I want one more coffee.

17:19.455 --> 17:20.707
You've had eight refills.

17:20.790 --> 17:24.627
In France, when you sit and order, you can
have the table as long as you want it.

17:24.670 --> 17:27.964
- I bet you know what I'm gonna say next.
- That we're not in France?

17:28.006 --> 17:29.716
Give or take a profanity.

17:29.800 --> 17:32.135
Fine, I'll go. Can I have my check?

17:34.304 --> 17:36.974
How's the spreading of the news going?

17:37.015 --> 17:39.852
It worked just like you wanted,
with one notable exception.

17:39.893 --> 17:40.936
Who? What?

17:41.019 --> 17:43.772
He's such a loner lately,
the news hasn't gotten to him.

17:43.856 --> 17:45.274
Is there any way to speed this up?

17:45.357 --> 17:48.986
Sorry, I'm figuring out the tip,
and I've always been terrible at Math.

17:49.027 --> 17:50.779
What's 6% of $4.43?

17:51.697 --> 17:55.409
Could you just tell him now,
so I can cross this off my list?

17:56.326 --> 17:58.328
He's coming over. Hang on.

18:00.622 --> 18:02.624
Have you heard the latest news?

18:02.708 --> 18:05.586
- Kind of sad, Lorelai and Max.
- What about them?

18:05.752 --> 18:08.380
- The wedding's off.
- What? What happened?

18:08.463 --> 18:11.258
I don't really know. It was kind of sudden.

18:11.341 --> 18:15.762
- This is actually her now.
- Tell her I'm sorry. That's tough.

18:15.929 --> 18:17.806
- He says he's sorry.
- Thanks.

18:17.973 --> 18:20.392
- Talk to you later. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.105
- What's this?
- Refill number 9.

18:25.189 --> 18:26.523
I thought you said I had to go.

18:26.565 --> 18:27.900
- You can hang a bit.
- Really?

18:27.983 --> 18:30.819
Welcome to France.
Coffee's on the house, though.

18:30.903 --> 18:33.071
Thanks, or should I say gracias?

18:33.155 --> 18:36.241
In fact, everyone's coffee
is on the house today.

18:36.909 --> 18:39.536
- Like your hat.
- Thank you.

18:40.537 --> 18:42.498
We have a son just a bit older than you.

18:42.581 --> 18:46.418
- He's not good enough for her.
- He's a freshman at Brown.

18:46.502 --> 18:49.129
- He majors in MTV.
- You're horrible.

18:49.630 --> 18:52.382
Honey, we don't even know
if she's on the market.

18:52.466 --> 18:55.302
I'm not on the market.
I'm definitely off the market.

18:55.385 --> 18:58.013
- She has a boyfriend.
- Isn't that cute?

18:58.514 --> 19:01.141
Mom, I saved you a scone.
You love me, right?

19:01.225 --> 19:04.228
Sorry, everybody,
I'm gonna have to drag her away now.

19:04.311 --> 19:08.482
- It was so nice talking to you.
- Lovely talking to you, dear.

19:09.024 --> 19:10.526
She's so cute.

19:10.692 --> 19:13.237
- I now have abandonment issues.
- I had to make a call.

19:13.278 --> 19:14.821
- You left me hanging.
- I owe you one.

19:14.905 --> 19:17.866
- Bigtime.
- You're out now. What do you want to do?

19:17.950 --> 19:18.951
- Kill you.
- And?

19:19.034 --> 19:21.620
- I don't know.
- Bounce tennis balls off of Sammy?

19:21.703 --> 19:23.455
- Seriously?
- I'm not sure.

19:23.497 --> 19:26.959
- Pull out the map you're hiding.
- I'm not hiding a map.

19:28.669 --> 19:30.963
I didn't wanna
drive around aimlessly again today.

19:31.046 --> 19:32.297
I got it.

19:32.881 --> 19:34.299
What's near?

19:37.344 --> 19:40.347
- Concord.
- What is that? Like, look at grapes?

19:40.472 --> 19:42.599
- Manchester.
- Been there, done that.

19:42.641 --> 19:45.227
- You've never been there.
- I feel like I have.

19:45.310 --> 19:47.271
- Salem.
- Witches and stonings.

19:47.354 --> 19:49.773
- There's something there.
- Boston, Newton, Needham.

19:49.815 --> 19:52.818
- Go back.
- What? Boston? Newton?

19:53.277 --> 19:56.321
- I know where we're going.
- Where are we going?

19:56.822 --> 19:58.282
You will love it.

19:58.323 --> 20:02.494
If you tell me where we're going,
I can chart a course, and I can...

20:02.619 --> 20:04.371
You're folding it wrong.

20:04.454 --> 20:05.914
- Is it smaller?
- Yes.

20:05.998 --> 20:08.208
Then it's not wrong. Let's go.

20:11.211 --> 20:14.047
I will get you a new one
when we get there.

20:14.173 --> 20:15.883
Where are we going?

20:21.513 --> 20:24.641
- I don't believe it.
- Believe it, because there it is.

20:24.683 --> 20:27.019
- Harvard University.
- It's really real.

20:27.102 --> 20:29.771
- It looks just like the pictures.
- It's beautiful.

20:29.855 --> 20:33.317
- What are we doing here?
- We are beholding your future.

20:33.442 --> 20:35.777
- It's big.
- You have a big future.

20:35.861 --> 20:38.989
I can't believe it.
I'm actually standing outside of Harvard.

20:39.031 --> 20:40.949
- Come on.
- Wait, come where?

20:41.033 --> 20:42.868
- Inside.
- We can't go inside.

20:42.910 --> 20:44.703
Why? Is there a force field around here?

20:44.745 --> 20:46.288
- This is Harvard.
- I know.

20:49.082 --> 20:51.001
You can't just go inside. You need a guide.

20:51.043 --> 20:52.252
I'll be your guide.

20:52.336 --> 20:56.548
- What do you know about Harvard?
- I know this: Look, there's Harvard.

20:56.924 --> 20:58.884
Don't you want to see it?

20:58.926 --> 21:01.512
The place where you'll be living
and studying...

21:01.595 --> 21:04.181
and developing very naive
but pretentious world views...

21:04.223 --> 21:06.600
that will come crashing down
the minute you graduate?

21:06.683 --> 21:08.894
- Yeah, I do.
- So?

21:09.520 --> 21:14.483
Come on, you know you want to.
All the other kids are doing it.

21:23.784 --> 21:26.954
- Harvard is over 300 years old.
- Founded in 1636.

21:27.037 --> 21:30.040
That means almost everyone
who ever went to Harvard is dead now.

21:30.082 --> 21:32.334
- You sure you still wanna go here?
- Yes, I'm sure.

21:32.417 --> 21:35.671
They developed the pacemaker here.

21:35.921 --> 21:38.465
Also discovered how electromagnetism
and radioactivity...

21:38.549 --> 21:40.384
are two manifestations
of the same force...

21:40.425 --> 21:42.594
and postulated existence
of a charmed quark.

21:42.678 --> 21:45.222
- I was wondering who did that.
- The smarties at Harvard.

21:45.264 --> 21:46.682
Holy smokes.

21:46.932 --> 21:50.602
They get an average of 18,000 applicants
every year, and only 2,000 get in.

21:50.686 --> 21:52.187
- Those are not good odds.
- Mom.

21:52.271 --> 21:53.730
No, you're different.

21:53.814 --> 21:56.900
'Past graduates: Henry James. '
Isn't that a beer?

21:56.942 --> 21:59.903
- And a novelist. Go on.
- 'John Adams. ' That's a beer.

21:59.945 --> 22:02.447
Our second President.
He's very in right now.

22:02.531 --> 22:05.242
'W.E.B. DuBois, Yo-Yo Ma. '

22:05.784 --> 22:07.619
- Cool! Fred Gwynne.
- Who?

22:07.703 --> 22:10.122
Herman Munster. Now I'm impressed.

22:10.622 --> 22:12.708
- Want something?
- A nice, cool Henry James.

22:12.791 --> 22:14.126
- Or some coffee?
- Or some coffee.

22:14.168 --> 22:16.461
I'm ordering coffee at Harvard.

22:18.797 --> 22:21.758
There's people looking for roommates,
tons of them.

22:21.800 --> 22:24.803
'Wanted: Girl to share
a two-bedroom apartment on Trowbridge.

22:24.887 --> 22:28.015
'Quiet street, quiet building,
so quiet roomie a must. '

22:28.098 --> 22:31.018
Join a convent and cloister yourself,
you loser.

22:31.101 --> 22:33.979
Mom, it's gonna be two years
before I go to Harvard.

22:34.021 --> 22:36.815
These people will have roommates
or have graduated by then.

22:36.857 --> 22:37.983
Who says these are for you?

22:38.066 --> 22:39.359
- Who are they for?
- Me.

22:39.443 --> 22:42.154
If you're here, I'd need a room nearby
so I can come visit.

22:42.196 --> 22:45.991
- How often are you gonna visit?
- I don't know. Every other day.

22:46.074 --> 22:48.076
Too much? What's too much?

22:53.665 --> 22:56.752
- Man, there are a lot of postings here.
- Yeah, there sure are.

22:56.835 --> 22:58.670
Are you looking for a place to live?

22:58.754 --> 23:00.756
- Maybe.
- There's a lot of choices.

23:00.839 --> 23:02.716
Something for everybody.

23:02.841 --> 23:06.386
Unless you're an existentialist
and can't figure out what you want.

23:06.470 --> 23:07.846
Good point.

23:08.180 --> 23:11.433
I think we have a class together.
Contract Law. Prof. Shefferson?

23:11.517 --> 23:13.477
- Yeah, Sheff's class.
- Right.

23:13.519 --> 23:16.980
- I've been meaning to say hi to you.
- Really? Hi.

23:18.941 --> 23:20.692
So, do you like the class?

23:20.776 --> 23:23.695
- It's not too bad.
- He's kind of got a monotone voice.

23:23.779 --> 23:27.991
- If I don't caff up, he puts me to sleep.
- I'm caffing up now, just for the hell of it.

23:28.033 --> 23:31.829
Okay. So I'll see you in class,
and maybe at that Phi Kap party tonight?

23:31.870 --> 23:32.913
Peachy.

23:32.996 --> 23:34.873
- Cool. Bye.
- Bye.

23:37.125 --> 23:39.378
I think I'm gonna like college.

23:39.419 --> 23:42.047
- I used 'existentialist' in a sentence.
- I heard.

23:42.130 --> 23:45.217
- I've always wanted to do that.
- It was very impressive.

23:49.346 --> 23:50.556
Oh, my!

23:51.723 --> 23:54.059
- What's this?
- It's the library.

23:55.018 --> 23:57.771
It's the biggest library I've ever seen.

23:57.855 --> 23:59.273
- Brace yourself.
- What?

23:59.356 --> 24:02.609
- This is just one of the libraries.
- One of the libraries?

24:02.693 --> 24:06.405
'This building is one component
of a 13 million-volume collection...

24:06.446 --> 24:08.532
'housed in more than
90 different libraries.

24:08.574 --> 24:13.245
'It's the oldest library in the US, and
the largest academic library in the world. '

24:13.829 --> 24:15.873
- Breathe.
- I'm a failure.

24:15.914 --> 24:17.666
- What?
- I am stupid.

24:17.749 --> 24:20.419
- Stop.
- I'm uninformed, ignorant, and...

24:20.460 --> 24:23.839
I can't even think of a second synonym
for 'uninformed. '

24:23.922 --> 24:25.424
- I suck.
- Honey.

24:25.632 --> 24:27.634
Thirteen million volumes?

24:27.968 --> 24:31.597
I've read 300 books in my entire life,
and I'm already 16?

24:31.680 --> 24:34.224
You know how long I would need
to read 13 million books?

24:34.308 --> 24:37.895
You don't have to read every one of them.
Tuesdays With Morrie. Skip that.

24:37.978 --> 24:39.980
Who Moved My Cheese?
Stuff you already know.

24:40.063 --> 24:42.900
But every kid coming to Harvard
is inevitably reading books.

24:42.941 --> 24:46.778
Different books. I want to be able to
converse intelligently with each of them.

24:46.862 --> 24:48.822
I can't do that unless I read books.

24:48.906 --> 24:50.908
At least a few
from every genre and subgenre.

24:50.991 --> 24:52.576
Come on, I'm getting you out of here.

24:52.659 --> 24:53.869
- I sleep too much.
- You don't.

24:53.952 --> 24:56.371
- I've been frittering away my life.
- You don't fritter.

24:56.455 --> 24:57.623
- Did I mention I suck?
- Yes.

24:57.706 --> 24:59.291
- Well, I do.
- No.

25:03.003 --> 25:05.130
This is a dorm? Not bad.

25:05.214 --> 25:08.759
- Pretty, actually.
- Let's see what it looks like on the inside.

25:08.842 --> 25:11.678
It says 'residents only' in plain English.

25:13.847 --> 25:15.307
We're gonna get in trouble.

25:15.349 --> 25:17.809
You're such a worrywart. Get in character.

25:17.893 --> 25:19.603
- Hey, there!
- Hi.

25:19.770 --> 25:21.647
I'm Angie. This is Trish.

25:22.814 --> 25:24.608
- How's it going?
- Not bad.

25:24.650 --> 25:27.653
Cool. We're just kind of hanging out
between classes.

25:27.694 --> 25:29.196
We got Sheff next.

25:29.279 --> 25:32.241
So, we'll probably see you
at the Phi Alpha Beta thing tomorrow?

25:32.324 --> 25:33.367
Maybe.

25:33.450 --> 25:36.662
Yeah, we're not sure, either.
They can be so totally lame.

25:36.703 --> 25:39.164
- Gag me.
- Yeah. See you.

25:40.958 --> 25:42.960
You do realize your college kid jargon...

25:43.043 --> 25:45.754
comes from Happy Days
and the Valley Girl song.

25:46.380 --> 25:48.298
- Looky-looky here.
- What are you doing?

25:48.340 --> 25:50.092
I wanna see a room. Hello?

25:50.175 --> 25:52.427
They have pictures of their rooms
on their website.

25:52.511 --> 25:54.137
I prefer reality, thank you.

25:54.221 --> 25:56.223
Hello? The coast is clear.

25:56.306 --> 25:58.600
- The coast is not clear.
- Susie!

25:59.059 --> 26:02.604
We're now officially breaking and entering.
Why are you saying that?

26:02.688 --> 26:04.064
It's our cover if we get caught.

26:04.147 --> 26:08.277
Plus, there's a 30% chance
the girl living in this room is named Susie.

26:08.360 --> 26:10.487
- Tiny.
- It is tiny.

26:10.571 --> 26:13.282
Your Oxford English Dictionary
will need a room of its own.

26:13.365 --> 26:16.326
- It'll fit somewhere.
- One window, brick wall.

26:16.493 --> 26:19.580
- You'll need a better view.
- This isn't my room, to begin with.

26:19.663 --> 26:23.167
At least there's two beds,
somewhere for me to sleep.

26:23.208 --> 26:25.711
- That'd be my roommate's bed.
- You don't want a roomie.

26:25.752 --> 26:28.046
- I don't have a choice.
- They force someone on you?

26:28.130 --> 26:30.048
It's all part of the socializing experience.

26:30.132 --> 26:31.967
- If it's a lemon?
- Then I'm stuck with it.

26:32.050 --> 26:34.595
- Hare Krishna banging a tambourine.
- I'll use earplugs.

26:34.678 --> 26:37.514
- Serial murderer.
- I'll sleep with a gat strapped to my ankle.

26:37.556 --> 26:40.058
- Someone who likes Linkin Park?
- Then I'll drop out.

26:40.100 --> 26:43.520
Look, I had these same pants
in high school!

26:43.562 --> 26:45.480
- Can we go now, please?
- I'm in again.

26:45.564 --> 26:46.648
- Mom.
- Okay.

26:46.732 --> 26:48.650
Let me take a picture with you at the desk.

26:48.734 --> 26:50.027
- What?
- Really get into it.

26:50.068 --> 26:52.738
- Pretend like you're studying.
- Okay.

26:55.157 --> 26:56.658
What, you're writing in the air?

26:56.742 --> 26:59.244
- Can we just take the picture?
- Okay.

26:59.870 --> 27:01.121
Let's go.

27:03.874 --> 27:05.250
Hey, Susie.

27:16.929 --> 27:21.475
- God, these classrooms are huge.
- The better to fit those big Harvard brains.

27:25.938 --> 27:28.857
'Mortal have you been born,
to mortals have you given birth.

27:28.941 --> 27:30.776
'Reckon on everything,
expect everything. '

27:30.859 --> 27:33.695
- What sort of thought is this?
- Depressing?

27:34.780 --> 27:39.618
On the surface, maybe. But go underneath.
What is he postulating beyond fatalism?

27:39.660 --> 27:41.912
- Are we allowed to be hearing this?
- I don't know.

27:41.954 --> 27:44.915
They won't charge $100
just for listening to part of the class?

27:44.957 --> 27:48.794
I don't think Harvard would
nickel-and-dime people like that.

27:48.961 --> 27:50.337
I'm gonna find the ladies' room.

27:50.420 --> 27:52.923
Sneak a smoke, see if anyone
slipped aspirin in my Coke.

27:52.965 --> 27:55.884
Okay, Rizzo.
I'd like to listen a little bit more.

27:55.968 --> 27:57.803
- I'll be back.
- I'll be here.

27:57.928 --> 28:02.599
The Stoics believed the greatest happiness
resulted from leading a virtuous life.

28:03.684 --> 28:06.436
- In or out?
- Excuse me?

28:06.478 --> 28:09.690
If you're going to take the class,
you have to take a seat.

28:10.983 --> 28:12.359
Okay, sorry.

28:15.571 --> 28:17.990
Okay, where were we?

28:57.487 --> 29:00.949
That's an interesting point,
but I'm not sure I agree with you.

29:01.033 --> 29:04.077
That's because Stoicism
was not about giving up things...

29:04.161 --> 29:06.705
- of money and luxuries and stuff.
- That's right.

29:06.788 --> 29:08.540
By the time he was in his early 40s...

29:08.582 --> 29:11.126
Seneca had earned enough money
to acquire villas, farms.

29:11.210 --> 29:14.004
He ate well. He loved expensive furniture.

29:14.046 --> 29:17.049
But he didn't consider that
a non-philosophical way to live.

29:17.090 --> 29:18.884
It's all kind of relative, though.

29:18.926 --> 29:20.594
- Here we go.
- What?

29:20.677 --> 29:23.096
Can't get through a class
without debating relativism.

29:23.180 --> 29:26.308
I just meant luxury to some
is not necessarily luxury to others.

29:26.391 --> 29:29.061
- A better subject for another time.
- Sorry.

29:29.102 --> 29:32.397
No, your point is well-taken,
but it's different than what's at hand.

29:32.439 --> 29:35.150
What we're talking about
is Seneca's choosing the better...

29:35.234 --> 29:38.820
more comfortable of two options
while remaining a Stoic.

29:39.655 --> 29:43.033
- Thanks, this was fun.
- All right, for your next meeting...

29:43.075 --> 29:45.994
we'll be reading
Marcus Aurelius' Meditations.

29:46.161 --> 29:47.454
- Did you see me?
- Yes.

29:47.538 --> 29:49.248
- I was in college.
- It was amazing.

29:49.289 --> 29:52.084
- Did I look like I belonged?
- Completely. You're a natural.

29:52.125 --> 29:54.920
I can't even believe how it happened.
I just got swept up.

29:55.003 --> 29:57.297
The teacher asked a question,
and before I knew it...

29:57.381 --> 29:59.925
- You were blowing them away.
- I don't know about that...

30:00.008 --> 30:03.095
- but I was talking and I couldn't stop.
- I know that feeling.

30:03.178 --> 30:06.223
College is gonna be amazing. I can't wait.

30:06.640 --> 30:09.935
I love college. I love Harvard.
I love fatalism.

30:21.155 --> 30:22.781
Please, we can carry the bags.

30:22.865 --> 30:24.908
- Nonsense.
- But they're so heavy.

30:24.992 --> 30:27.870
I'll just get them down the stairs for you.

30:27.953 --> 30:30.080
Let me catch my breath here.

30:31.123 --> 30:32.583
Sammy's AWOL?

30:33.458 --> 30:36.170
Sammy. It's the first time
she hasn't been on the stairs.

30:36.253 --> 30:37.337
- My Sammy?
- Yes.

30:37.421 --> 30:40.465
- She's rarely ever on the stairs.
- No, she's always right there.

30:40.549 --> 30:43.218
No, she has her favorite place,
but not on the stairs.

30:43.302 --> 30:46.096
There's not been one moment
she hasn't been right there.

30:46.138 --> 30:49.516
On the stairs?
No, she's hardly ever on the stairs.

30:49.600 --> 30:51.935
'Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown. '

30:56.899 --> 30:59.985
Everything's on your card.
I hope you enjoyed your stay.

31:00.068 --> 31:01.945
- Did you enjoy your stay?
- Very much.

31:01.987 --> 31:03.071
Very much?

31:03.155 --> 31:05.949
- I sat and forever am at work here.
- What?

31:06.909 --> 31:09.077
- It was great.
- There you go.

31:09.161 --> 31:12.664
Drive safely and tell all your friends
about The Cheshire Cat.

31:12.748 --> 31:13.874
You bet we will.

31:13.957 --> 31:16.919
- Now I'll do my favorite part of the job.
- What's that?

31:17.002 --> 31:19.630
Read what you wrote in our guest book.

31:19.713 --> 31:21.256
Give us a five-minute head start?

31:21.340 --> 31:23.217
- Beg pardon?
- Thank you.

31:34.353 --> 31:36.980
- Know what I love most about Harvard?
- No, what?

31:37.064 --> 31:38.941
They don't sell giant foam fingers.

31:39.024 --> 31:41.485
No, they've got class out the wazoo.

31:42.361 --> 31:44.822
- Home.
- Feel like we've been gone a long time.

31:44.863 --> 31:48.116
It's weird. Every time I leave town,
even for just a little while...

31:48.200 --> 31:50.661
I always expect
everything to look different.

31:50.744 --> 31:53.205
- And it never does.
- It never does.

32:05.467 --> 32:06.844
Need a hug?

32:08.345 --> 32:09.805
Patty's good.

32:20.732 --> 32:22.568
So, what about dinner?

32:22.651 --> 32:25.487
It should be something healthy,
since we've been eating junk.

32:25.571 --> 32:27.698
We had lettuce on our burgers last night.

32:27.739 --> 32:29.741
- We picked it off.
- But it left its essence.

32:29.825 --> 32:32.077
- Lettuce essence on our burgers?
- Definitely.

32:32.161 --> 32:34.705
- That satisfied our vegetable requirement?
- For the week.

32:34.788 --> 32:37.374
We can't argue with cold, hard facts.

32:39.376 --> 32:40.460
What?

32:42.546 --> 32:44.715
- I forgot about that.
- Me, too.

32:47.551 --> 32:49.428
Everything's the same.

33:28.592 --> 33:31.678
This is Sever Hall,
one of the oldest buildings at Harvard.

33:31.762 --> 33:33.764
- Focus the picture, Lorelai.
- It is focused.

33:33.805 --> 33:35.933
- That's how it came out.
- It's hurting my eyes.

33:35.974 --> 33:39.311
- Just be a little arty.
- She doesn't know how to use a camera.

33:39.353 --> 33:42.898
- I've only had it six years.
- It's like I have glaucoma.

33:44.107 --> 33:45.108
What's that?

33:45.192 --> 33:47.736
- That is a Harvard squirrel.
- Good grief.

33:47.820 --> 33:48.946
Sitting on a Harvard rock.

33:49.029 --> 33:52.032
- Doesn't he look smart?
- He looks dirty. Next.

33:53.033 --> 33:56.119
- That's Rory's dorm and part of my finger.
- It's not my dorm yet.

33:56.161 --> 33:58.121
We saw a dorm
and figured it might be mine.

33:58.163 --> 34:01.500
- Why do you insist on taking slides?
- I like slides.

34:01.542 --> 34:04.169
But prints are so much easier
and faster to get through.

34:04.253 --> 34:06.213
That's what I hate about prints.

34:06.296 --> 34:09.299
You give people this big pile of pictures
you're so proud of.

34:09.382 --> 34:12.177
They flip through them fast
without really seeing them...

34:12.219 --> 34:14.513
or letting you narrate,
like you can with slides.

34:14.554 --> 34:17.516
- I stopped her from adding music.
- I'm eternally grateful.

34:17.558 --> 34:20.893
I like the bigness of slides, too.
Makes you feel like you're there.

34:20.978 --> 34:24.273
This one makes me feel
just like I'm in your finger.

34:25.148 --> 34:27.860
You're just jealous
'cause we didn't invite you along.

34:27.900 --> 34:28.944
Next time.

34:29.027 --> 34:31.321
Next time you go,
you're going to do it properly...

34:31.362 --> 34:34.366
- with a scheduled visit and guide.
- I told her about the guide.

34:34.449 --> 34:36.493
Why go out of town
so soon before your wedding?

34:36.577 --> 34:38.536
Didn't your fiancé mind?

34:41.039 --> 34:44.208
You act as if this coming weekend
is just business as usual...

34:44.293 --> 34:46.210
and not the most important day
of your life.

34:46.253 --> 34:47.337
Mom.

34:49.672 --> 34:50.757
What?

34:50.882 --> 34:53.886
- It's about this weekend, Mom.
- Yes?

34:56.013 --> 34:57.931
I should have told you before.

34:58.015 --> 35:00.017
Oh, my God. You didn't.

35:01.101 --> 35:02.394
- What?
- You did!

35:02.477 --> 35:04.438
- I did what?
- You eloped.

35:04.730 --> 35:07.566
I knew you'd do anything
to keep me out of this wedding.

35:07.649 --> 35:10.527
- Mom, that's not...
- That is just cruel, Lorelai.

35:10.569 --> 35:13.113
A mother waits and plans for this day,
even your mother.

35:13.197 --> 35:14.781
- Yes, but...
- I bought a new dress.

35:14.865 --> 35:16.283
- Got my hair done.
- It looks nice.

35:16.366 --> 35:19.036
And you just waltz in here,
torture me for hours...

35:19.077 --> 35:22.372
with these ridiculous slides,
only to let me know at the last minute...

35:22.414 --> 35:26.168
Mom, Max and I are not together anymore.
The wedding is off.

35:27.211 --> 35:30.005
- The wedding's off?
- Yes.

35:30.422 --> 35:32.883
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

35:38.347 --> 35:40.390
- Who called it off?
- I did.

35:44.937 --> 35:47.523
You're thinking you're not surprised.

35:48.982 --> 35:50.317
No, I wasn't.

35:50.400 --> 35:53.445
You're thinking,
'Yes, I won that $5 from Dad. '

35:53.946 --> 35:57.783
- Who would like dessert?
- What are you thinking? Just tell me.

35:59.159 --> 36:02.371
I was thinking,
I guess I have to return your gift.

36:03.664 --> 36:05.582
- My gift?
- That's right.

36:06.375 --> 36:09.211
You'll have to return my gift.
That's what you were thinking?

36:09.294 --> 36:10.587
That's right.

36:10.629 --> 36:12.506
- That's it?
- That's it.

36:17.761 --> 36:19.805
So you got me a gift already?

36:19.888 --> 36:23.600
You were getting married. Gifts are
expected. It's the proper thing to do.

36:23.642 --> 36:26.436
- So, how does ice cream sound?
- Ice cream sounds great.

36:26.478 --> 36:28.856
- What'd you get me, Mom?
- I'm not gonna tell you.

36:28.939 --> 36:30.941
- Why? It's for me.
- You're not getting it now.

36:30.983 --> 36:32.693
Iced tea spoons, right?

36:32.776 --> 36:35.404
Because nobody really needs
iced tea spoons ever.

36:35.487 --> 36:37.364
You'd probably use them
if you remembered...

36:37.447 --> 36:40.450
but nobody does. They're never
with the everyday silverware.

36:40.534 --> 36:42.327
Out of sight, out of mind.

36:42.369 --> 36:45.038
So people just grab
a regular everyday spoon to stir.

36:45.122 --> 36:48.500
- And you know what? They work fine.
- It wasn't iced tea spoons.

36:49.751 --> 36:51.295
Corn-on-the-cob holder thingies?

36:51.336 --> 36:54.047
- Sterling silver corn-on-the-cob holders?
- No.

36:54.506 --> 36:55.632
What?

36:56.091 --> 36:58.010
- The tiny forks.
- What tiny forks?

36:58.051 --> 37:01.847
The ones with tiny prongs and handles,
that I assume are used to eat tiny food?

37:01.889 --> 37:04.975
- They're for lobster tails.
- So you did get the tiny forks.

37:05.058 --> 37:08.854
You know what? I'm not returning the gift.
I'm going to put it away.

37:08.896 --> 37:11.190
You won't know what it is
until you do get married.

37:11.273 --> 37:12.316
- Tell me now.
- Sorry.

37:12.399 --> 37:15.527
I may never get married.
I may be a free spirit my whole life...

37:15.611 --> 37:18.655
or fall for a separated Catholic guy
like Katherine Hepburn did...

37:18.739 --> 37:20.741
and not get to go to his funeral
when he dies.

37:20.824 --> 37:22.993
- Then you'll never know what I got.
- I must know.

37:23.035 --> 37:24.203
- No.
- This is torture.

37:24.286 --> 37:26.288
- Tough.
- Okay, fine. Forget it.

37:26.371 --> 37:29.791
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- I'm going to the kitchen.

37:33.712 --> 37:36.048
- Oh, God. You scared me.
- Come on, tell me.

37:36.089 --> 37:37.883
- Lorelai, get away.
- Tell me now.

37:37.925 --> 37:39.718
- I'm serious, get away.
- Please tell me.

37:39.760 --> 37:40.886
This is not funny.

37:42.513 --> 37:45.474
- Am I too far from the curb?
- You're within 5 feet.

37:45.557 --> 37:47.100
- Close enough for jazz.
- What?

37:47.184 --> 37:48.685
- Look it up?
- You got it.

37:50.229 --> 37:52.314
- Oh, my God. Lane!
- I'm back!

37:52.397 --> 37:53.357
I see.

37:53.440 --> 37:56.527
- Did you ever think this day would come?
- I had hopes, dreams.

37:56.610 --> 37:59.238
I escaped from Korea. I'm home.
Hi, Lorelai.

37:59.321 --> 38:01.698
- Welcome home, sweetie.
- It's so amazing to be back.

38:01.740 --> 38:03.742
When I got off the plane,
I kissed the tarmac.

38:03.784 --> 38:05.911
- Like the Pope.
- It was hot, I burned my lips.

38:05.994 --> 38:07.746
That's why the Pope always looks grumpy.

38:07.788 --> 38:09.248
- I'm back.
- I know.

38:09.289 --> 38:11.875
- Did you get my letters?
- The first one was intense.

38:11.917 --> 38:13.919
- Which one was that?
- The one that said:

38:14.002 --> 38:16.880
'Korea equals death,'
with a bunch of exclamation points...

38:16.964 --> 38:20.926
- and your sad face plastered all over it.
- That was a tad dramatic.

38:20.968 --> 38:22.719
- Was it awful?
- It wasn't.

38:22.761 --> 38:24.596
- Really?
- Some of it was great.

38:24.680 --> 38:25.681
No way.

38:25.764 --> 38:29.601
The food's not so bad, and then my
cousins were actually pretty interesting.

38:29.685 --> 38:32.271
And the best part,
Korea is bootleg heaven.

38:32.354 --> 38:33.772
I totally scored in Seoul.

38:33.856 --> 38:36.900
Elvis Costello at the Marquee in 1978...

38:36.984 --> 38:40.320
a barely coherent
Nico doing Doors songs in 1974...

38:40.404 --> 38:41.905
and an even more barely coherent...

38:41.947 --> 38:44.950
Iggy Pop doing David Bowie songs naked
in 1981.

38:45.033 --> 38:46.660
How did you get them past customs?

38:46.743 --> 38:49.246
I strapped them to my body,
like in Midnight Express.

38:49.329 --> 38:51.373
- Cool.
- I'll be in Luke's.

38:53.750 --> 38:57.921
- It was just an open-ended plane ticket?
- Just to save money. I kind of overreacted.

38:57.963 --> 38:59.631
Kind of? You did everything...

38:59.715 --> 39:02.259
but drown yourself
tied to the Statue of Liberty.

39:05.804 --> 39:08.974
- Lewis and Clark have returned.
- Which one are you?

39:09.057 --> 39:11.977
I don't know.
Which one had to paddle the canoe?

39:12.477 --> 39:14.438
- Coffee?
- You have to ask?

39:17.274 --> 39:19.276
Sorry about what happened, the wedding...

39:19.359 --> 39:22.988
It's okay.
I'm fine. I want everyone to know that.

39:23.197 --> 39:26.658
- I've been feeling like a jerk.
- Why?

39:26.700 --> 39:30.162
The way I had to come down on Max,
I don't know. I was being a...

39:30.204 --> 39:32.706
What's that word you use?
'Pickle-schnitz'?

39:32.789 --> 39:34.917
- Schnickelfritz?
- Yeah, that's it.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.127
Luke, it's okay. You already apologized.

39:37.169 --> 39:39.755
- I've been feeling kind of guilty.
- Don't.

39:39.838 --> 39:41.673
You are great, Luke.

39:41.715 --> 39:44.426
Just making me that chuppah alone...

39:44.927 --> 39:48.972
The chuppah.
I left that stupid chuppah on your lawn.

39:49.056 --> 39:50.390
- It's okay.
- What an idiot.

39:50.474 --> 39:51.975
Really, it's okay.

39:52.059 --> 39:55.354
This enormous reminder
sitting on your lawn, mocking you.

39:55.395 --> 39:56.772
I didn't see it mock, I promise.

39:56.855 --> 40:01.068
I'll take it down in the morning. No,
I'll take it down now. We're closing early.

40:01.151 --> 40:02.194
Chew it or lose it.

40:02.277 --> 40:04.613
Luke, it's okay, really.

40:06.615 --> 40:08.700
I think I'm gonna keep it.

40:08.784 --> 40:10.202
- What?
- Yeah.

40:10.285 --> 40:13.038
It's beautiful.
You made it for me, and it doesn't...

40:13.080 --> 40:17.584
have to be a wedding chuppah.
It can be a beautiful archway in our yard.

40:17.751 --> 40:20.337
- I'll grow stuff on it.
- Well, okay.

40:21.547 --> 40:24.633
I'll help you move it around the yard,
wherever you want it to be.

40:24.716 --> 40:25.926
That would be good.

40:27.594 --> 40:29.388
So, where'd you guys go?

40:29.471 --> 40:31.098
We drove around a little...

40:31.181 --> 40:35.394
- hit a B & B, and took a tour of Harvard.
- Harvard?

40:35.435 --> 40:37.896
- Interesting.
- It was amazing.

40:37.938 --> 40:41.650
Seeing Rory there, in a dorm room,
in a classroom...

40:42.234 --> 40:44.653
- She fit.
- I can see her fitting there.

40:44.736 --> 40:46.488
She was right at home.

40:46.947 --> 40:48.949
So, how are you taking that?

40:49.032 --> 40:51.451
- Taking what?
- Seeing her fit.

40:52.035 --> 40:53.537
I loved it...

40:55.289 --> 40:58.041
- and I hated it.
- That seems about right.

40:58.167 --> 41:00.252
Man, these past few days...

41:00.836 --> 41:04.715
So many thoughts about my life then...

41:04.756 --> 41:06.884
my life now, what I missed.

41:06.925 --> 41:09.761
Thoughts about what I'll never have...

41:10.387 --> 41:13.432
- and what I want to have.
- That's a lot of thoughts.

41:13.515 --> 41:16.185
You're not kidding.
So, can I ask you a question?

41:16.268 --> 41:19.897
- Ever set up a line of credit at a bank?
- No.

41:19.938 --> 41:22.232
You don't pay for everything
with cash on hand?

41:22.274 --> 41:23.901
What's all this about?

41:23.984 --> 41:26.904
- I think it's time to make a move.
- Meaning?

41:26.945 --> 41:30.157
I'm diving in. Sookie and I
are finally gonna open that inn.

41:30.240 --> 41:32.493
- Yeah, I know.
- No, I mean now.

41:32.576 --> 41:35.954
We've been talking and dreaming about it.
It's time to get going on it.

41:35.996 --> 41:38.499
- Well, if the time is right...
- It is.

41:39.041 --> 41:41.210
You think I can hack
being a business owner?

41:41.293 --> 41:43.378
- I think you can hack anything.
- Really?

41:43.462 --> 41:46.298
Yeah, you know
all the creative stuff to the job...

41:46.381 --> 41:49.384
you can manage,
and I've seen you try to add numbers...

41:49.468 --> 41:51.595
so I'd get an accountant, first thing.

41:51.637 --> 41:53.680
- Okay, yes.
- How far along are you?

41:53.764 --> 41:55.766
- This far.
- Well, listen...

41:56.475 --> 42:01.104
I'm no financial genius,
but we can sit down sometime.

42:01.813 --> 42:04.942
You can pick my brain
on the few things I do know about.

42:04.983 --> 42:06.610
- Really?
- I've been around some.

42:06.693 --> 42:08.111
Can I ask you stupid questions?

42:08.153 --> 42:11.073
- There is no such thing.
- How does ink come out of pens?

42:11.156 --> 42:13.492
All right, there is such a thing.

42:13.575 --> 42:16.829
But you're going to avoid that
when we sit down, right?

42:22.167 --> 42:23.377
Thank you.

42:23.836 --> 42:27.631
Let me know when you need help with
the thing that's not a chuppah anymore.

42:27.673 --> 42:29.007
I will.

42:36.515 --> 42:39.226
Fill me in. What've you been up to?
I must know everything.

42:39.309 --> 42:43.146
- I've been to Harvard.
- No way. Oh, my God! How? When?

42:43.188 --> 42:46.233
We just got back.
Mom, is it okay if I go to Lane's for a bit?

42:46.316 --> 42:49.361
Yeah. I'll meet you back at the house.

42:49.862 --> 42:52.698
Harvard? That is so cool.
What did you see?

42:52.781 --> 42:56.285
Harvard Yard, classrooms,
where I might live next year.

42:56.368 --> 42:57.953
- How was it?
- Needs a spruce.

42:58.036 --> 42:59.371
I'll help you spruce.

43:10.382 --> 43:12.759
Sookie, hey, it's me. We're back.

43:13.385 --> 43:15.846
It was good, but first things first.

43:15.888 --> 43:18.765
I want to start moving on the inn thing.

43:19.683 --> 43:23.187
I mean, take serious steps.
We're ready, don't you think?

43:24.062 --> 43:27.399
Oh, good.
Meet me early at work tomorrow.

43:31.028 --> 43:33.197
I know. I'm excited, too.

44:12.820 --> 44:13.821
