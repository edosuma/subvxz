00:29.567 --> 00:31.067
YOU GUYS WERE GONNA

00:31.067 --> 00:32.533
WHEN HE GOT HOME FROM WORK,

00:32.533 --> 00:34.133
SO I THOUGHT I'D WAIT
FOR HIM OVER HERE.

00:34.133 --> 00:37.567
IS THAT OKAY?
- OH, YEAH, SURE. YEAH.

00:40.533 --> 00:44.233
SO WHEN DID ROBERT SAY
HE WAS GONNA COME HOME?

00:44.233 --> 00:46.767
- ABOUT AN HOUR.

00:53.400 --> 00:56.200
ARE YOU EXCITED ABOUT
FONDUE DATE NIGHT?

01:05.367 --> 01:08.400
FOR AMY'S FIRST ANNUAL
FONDUE NIGHT.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.600
IT'S GONNA BE JUST
THE THREE BARONE COUPLES,

01:10.600 --> 01:11.833
LIKE A TRIPLE DATE.

01:11.833 --> 01:14.367
- HEY...

01:14.367 --> 01:17.700
HEY, A DATE WITH MY PARENTS.

01:17.700 --> 01:21.200
- I KNOW YOU THINK IT'S CORNY,
BUT IT'LL BE FUN, REALLY.

01:21.200 --> 01:24.200
FONDUE DATE NIGHT.
- YEAH.

01:24.200 --> 01:26.067
YEAH, FUN.

01:26.067 --> 01:27.133

01:27.133 --> 01:28.700
I'LL TALK TO ROBERT ABOUT IT

01:28.700 --> 01:32.100
WHEN HE GETS HERE
IN 58 MINUTES.

01:33.633 --> 01:35.200
- OH, MAY I?

01:35.200 --> 01:38.700

01:38.700 --> 01:41.700
OH, LOOK, THIS ONE

SO FROM NOW ON,

01:54.633 --> 01:57.100

02:00.000 --> 02:01.200
THERE HE IS!

02:01.200 --> 02:02.800

- HELLO, THERE.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.533
- MISSED YOU.
- YEAH, WHAT'S UP?

02:04.533 --> 02:07.167
WE'VE BEEN WAITING
AN HOUR AND 11 MINUTES.

02:08.333 --> 02:09.933
- AMY, MA WANTED ME
TO REMIND YOU THAT

02:09.933 --> 02:11.933
YOU'LL BE MAKING THE SALAD
FOR THE DINNER TONIGHT.

02:11.933 --> 02:14.100
- OH, I FORGOT.
I BETTER GO.

02:14.100 --> 02:17.767
DARN.

02:17.767 --> 02:19.133
- SEE YOU LATER, YOGI.

02:19.133 --> 02:24.600
AND, RAY, I'LL SEE YOU
AT FONDUE.

02:24.600 --> 02:27.933
- OKAY, YEAH.

02:27.933 --> 02:29.100
- SHE'S SUCH A CUTIE PIE.

02:29.100 --> 02:30.267
[both groan]

02:30.267 --> 02:32.067
OH, IT'S
THE SECOND HALF ALREADY?

02:32.067 --> 02:34.567
- YEAH, MAN, YOU'RE MISSING
SOME GREAT BASKETBALL.

02:36.200 --> 02:38.533
ACTUALLY, I KIND OF
MISSED SOME TOO.

02:38.533 --> 02:42.867
I WAS--ME AND AMY,
WE HAD A NICE LONG...

02:42.867 --> 02:45.667
CHAT.

02:45.667 --> 02:47.200
- ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S REALLY NICE.

02:47.200 --> 02:48.700
WHAT DID YOU GUYS
TALK ABOUT?

02:48.700 --> 02:52.033
- OH, GOSH, PRETTY MUCH
EVERYTHING, I THINK, YEAH.

02:52.033 --> 02:53.633
- YEAH, AMY'S GREAT, HUH?

02:53.633 --> 02:57.033
- YEAH, AMY'S GREAT.
SHE'S GREAT. YEAH.

02:58.700 --> 03:02.767
KIND OF LIKE
A LITTLE LADY CHATTERLEY.

03:04.133 --> 03:07.100
- LADY CHATTERLEY?
- YEAH.

03:07.100 --> 03:09.033
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

03:09.033 --> 03:10.333
- OH, YOU KNOW,
LIKE SHE ALWAYS--

03:10.333 --> 03:12.433
SHE ALWAYS WANTS TO KNOW
HOW EVERYBODY IS,

03:12.433 --> 03:15.900
AND SHE GETS REAL EXCITED
ABOUT FONDUE DATE NIGHT.

03:15.900 --> 03:18.733
AND SHE TOLD ME ABOUT
THIS INTERESTING SALESGIRL

03:18.733 --> 03:21.400
THAT SOLD HER A SWEATER
AND--AND--AND, YOU KNOW,

03:21.400 --> 03:25.133
WHATEVER; IT'S ALL GOOD STUFF;
IT'S ALL GOOD.

03:25.133 --> 03:28.067
- ARE YOU SAYING THAT
AMY TALKS TOO MUCH?

03:33.100 --> 03:35.467
- NO, ROBERT, I LOVE AMY.

03:37.367 --> 03:39.100
- WOW, ARE YOU A LIAR.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.433
YOU KNOW,
I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

03:42.433 --> 03:45.067
I GOT SOMETHING GOOD,
AND YOU CAN'T STAND IT.

03:45.067 --> 03:46.300
YOU NEVER COULD.

03:46.300 --> 03:47.500
REMEMBER WHEN
I MADE THAT DIORAMA

03:47.500 --> 03:49.533
IN MR. CAROLAN'S
HISTORY CLASS?

03:49.533 --> 03:50.733
- WHAT?

03:50.733 --> 03:53.300
- EVERYBODY SAID
HOW GREAT IT WAS, EVERYBODY!

03:55.333 --> 03:57.100
I WON A PRIZE, REMEMBER?

03:57.100 --> 03:58.733
BUT YOU SAID IT STUNK.

03:58.733 --> 04:01.767
- YOU HAD GEORGE WASHINGTON
FIGHTING A DINOSAUR.

04:01.767 --> 04:04.600
- IT WAS A DRAGON, RAYMOND!

04:04.600 --> 04:10.267
A DRAGON THAT REPRESENTED
YEARS OF BRITISH TYRANNY!

04:11.767 --> 04:13.133
WHICH JUST GOES TO SHOW

04:13.133 --> 04:15.133
HOW STUPID YOU WERE
THEN AND NOW.

04:15.133 --> 04:16.400
- ROBERT, I DIDN'T--

04:16.400 --> 04:17.800
- EVERYBODY THINKS
MY WIFE IS GREAT.

04:17.800 --> 04:20.133
EVERYBODY!

04:23.800 --> 04:26.067
SO YOU HAVE TO TELL ME THAT
SHE'S A LADY CHATTERBOX

04:26.067 --> 04:27.367
WHO WON'T SHUT UP?

04:27.367 --> 04:29.800
I KNOW HOW IT GOES.

04:29.800 --> 04:33.200
JEALOUS ASS.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.767
- COME ON--

04:34.767 --> 04:37.000
- JEAL-ASS!

04:37.000 --> 04:38.433
YES!

04:38.433 --> 04:41.500
- STOP IT! NO!
COME ON, DON'T GO, ROBERT!

04:41.500 --> 04:44.400
STAY! COME STAY
AND WATCH THE GAME!

04:44.400 --> 04:45.733
COME ON.

04:45.733 --> 04:47.767
YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING BAD
ABOUT MY WIFE, YOU CAN!

04:47.767 --> 04:50.100
I DON'T CARE!

04:50.100 --> 04:52.633
AH, COME ON!

04:52.633 --> 04:53.767
SAY IT! SAY IT!

04:53.767 --> 04:56.733
SHE'S A BAD COOK,
AND SHE'S MEAN!

04:58.967 --> 05:01.667
HEY, HI...ONE SECOND,
ONE SECOND.

05:01.667 --> 05:03.700
AND YOU MAY
THINK THAT, ROBERT.

05:03.700 --> 05:05.467
YOU'D BE DEAD WRONG!

05:05.467 --> 05:07.600
DEAD WRONG!

05:07.600 --> 05:12.133
DEBRA IS A CARING,
BEAUTIFUL, SKINNY PERSON!

05:15.800 --> 05:18.433
SO HOW'S IT GOING?

05:24.933 --> 05:28.600
LOOK, I SAVED YOU THIS CHIP.
IT LOOKS LIKE A HEART.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.367
- HI, HONEY.

05:43.367 --> 05:44.300
- HEY.

05:44.300 --> 05:45.967
- YOU'VE BEEN QUIET ALL NIGHT.

05:45.967 --> 05:47.200
ARE YOU OKAY?

05:47.200 --> 05:48.233
- YEAH, I'M FINE.

05:48.233 --> 05:49.267
EVERYTHING OKAY WITH YOU?

05:49.267 --> 05:51.400
- FINE AND DANDY.

05:51.400 --> 05:54.033
- OOH, DID I SHOW YOU
THIS SWEATER I GOT?

05:57.333 --> 05:58.633
- IT'S NICE.

05:58.633 --> 06:00.267
- THE SALESGIRL
I BOUGHT IT FROM, BRIGID,

06:00.267 --> 06:02.000
SHE WAS SO SWEET AND SMART.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.500
SHE'S TAKING SOME TIME OFF
OF SCHOOL TO MAKE SOME MONEY,

06:04.500 --> 06:05.833
BUT I REALLY HOPE
SHE FINISHES,

06:05.833 --> 06:07.200
BECAUSE SHE'S REALLY GREAT--

06:07.200 --> 06:09.633
- AND THEN YOU
BOUGHT THE SWEATER; GOT IT.

06:11.733 --> 06:13.300
I'M SORRY.

06:13.300 --> 06:16.267
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW,
I KIND OF DID HAVE A BAD DAY.

06:16.267 --> 06:18.267
- OH? WHAT HAPPENED?

06:18.267 --> 06:21.300
- OH, NOTHING;
IT'S JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER DAY,

06:21.300 --> 06:24.567
DEALING WITH
THE SCUM OF THE EARTH.

06:24.567 --> 06:29.467
- WELL, AT LEAST
YOU GET TOMORROW OFF.

06:29.467 --> 06:32.567
AND THEN, HEY,
FONDUE DATE NIGHT.

06:33.733 --> 06:35.333
THAT'LL BE FUN...

06:35.333 --> 06:37.467
DUE!

06:39.167 --> 06:41.533
- YEAH, YOU KNOW,
I WAS THINKING,

06:41.533 --> 06:45.033
MAYBE FONDUE DATE NIGHT IS NOT
SUCH A GOOD IDEA RIGHT NOW.

06:45.033 --> 06:46.533
- REALLY?

06:46.533 --> 06:48.533
EVERYBODY ELSE IS
EXCITED ABOUT IT, EVEN RAY.

06:48.533 --> 06:52.133
- AMY, WHY DO YOU
EVEN BOTHER WITH HIM?

06:52.133 --> 06:54.067
- I KNOW HE DOESN'T
LIKE TO OPEN UP,

06:54.067 --> 06:56.400
BUT LITTLE BY LITTLE,

06:56.400 --> 06:59.467
I THINK
I'M CRACKING HIS SHELL.

07:00.600 --> 07:02.033
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:02.033 --> 07:05.433
THERE'S A SWEET PERSON
INSIDE.

07:06.667 --> 07:08.167
OH, LISTEN...

07:08.167 --> 07:10.900
I KNOW YOU AND RAYMOND
HAVE HAD YOUR PROBLEMS--

07:10.900 --> 07:13.133
- HE SAID YOU TALK TOO MUCH!

07:15.733 --> 07:19.067
- WHAT?

07:19.067 --> 07:22.433
- HE CALLED YOU
LADY BLABBERMOUTH.

07:25.100 --> 07:27.400
- HE DID?

07:27.400 --> 07:29.467
- LOOK, AMY, I'M SORRY.

07:29.467 --> 07:33.467
I'VE KNOWN RAYMOND
FOR A LONG TIME, AND...

07:33.467 --> 07:37.333
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT A JEAL-ASS IS?

07:39.967 --> 07:42.600
- NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,

07:42.600 --> 07:44.300
WHILE WE WERE TALKING
THIS AFTERNOON,

07:44.300 --> 07:46.133
HE DID EXCUSE HIMSELF
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM,

07:46.133 --> 07:48.433
LIKE, FIVE TIMES.

07:48.433 --> 07:51.800
I THOUGHT HE HAD
A TUMMY PROBLEM.

07:51.800 --> 07:53.133
- IT'S NOT HIS TUMMY.

07:53.133 --> 07:56.967
HE HAS NO SOUL.

07:56.967 --> 07:59.767
- SO HE JUST WANTED ME
TO GO AWAY?

08:02.133 --> 08:05.133
THAT IS KIND OF...

08:06.800 --> 08:09.133
JERKY.

08:11.300 --> 08:14.433
- I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

08:16.567 --> 08:18.367
BUT HEY, YOU KNOW,
THIS IS GOOD.

08:18.367 --> 08:21.300
TOMORROW NIGHT,
MORE CHEESE FOR US.

08:21.300 --> 08:23.633
- NO, NO, EVERYBODY'S COMING.

08:23.633 --> 08:26.700
I'M JUST NOT GONNA LET
RAY'S OPINION AFFECT ME.

08:26.700 --> 08:28.767
- OKAY, GOOD, GOOD.

08:28.767 --> 08:31.300
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:31.300 --> 08:33.233
DON'T EVEN TALK TO HIM.

08:33.233 --> 08:36.167
IN FACT,
JUST STAY QUIET ALL NIGHT.

08:36.167 --> 08:39.900
WE WON'T EVEN GIVE HIM A CHANCE
TO THINK THAT WAY ABOUT YOU.

08:39.900 --> 08:42.033
HUH?

08:49.067 --> 08:51.367
- ROBERT...

08:51.367 --> 08:55.067
WHEN I WAS JUST
TELLING YOU MY SWEATER STORY,

08:55.067 --> 08:58.033
AND YOU TOLD ME TO...

09:00.433 --> 09:03.900
WAS THAT BECAUSE YOU
THINK I TALK TOO MUCH?

09:03.900 --> 09:06.267
- NO, NO.

09:06.267 --> 09:08.567
THAT'S BECAUSE
RAYMOND BROUGHT IT UP,

09:08.567 --> 09:10.767
YOU KNOW, AND I DIDN'T WANT HIM
TO THINK THAT HE WAS RIGHT.

09:10.767 --> 09:14.600
'CAUSE YOU KNOW,
LIKE YOU SAID, "JERKY."

09:15.767 --> 09:17.133
AND I LOVE THIS NEW SWEATER.

09:17.133 --> 09:18.900
IT'S A GREAT SWEATER.

09:18.900 --> 09:20.933
GREAT STORY ABOUT
THE SWEATER.

09:20.933 --> 09:23.667
I'M STEALING THAT STORY!

09:25.567 --> 09:27.933
OKAY, W-W-WAIT,
AMY, AMY. WAIT.

09:27.933 --> 09:31.733
AMY!

09:31.733 --> 09:33.433
[door closes]

09:33.433 --> 09:36.500
THE ONE TIME I GET A WORD IN.

09:43.867 --> 09:46.833
- OKAY, WE HAVE TWO
DIFFERENT KINDS OF CHEESES,

09:46.833 --> 09:49.600
AND THE CHOCOLATE
IS FOR ALL THE FRUIT.

09:49.600 --> 09:51.667
- MOVE IT, LADY,
I'M GOING IN.

09:53.500 --> 09:54.833
- HELLO.

09:54.833 --> 09:56.333
- OH, HI.
- HI.

09:56.333 --> 09:59.700
- OH, AMY, EVERYTHING
SMELLS GREAT.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.933
- THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

10:01.933 --> 10:04.633
- MARIE, HERE IS THE GARLIC
TOAST I MADE FOR DIPPING.

10:04.633 --> 10:06.233
- OH, THANK YOU.

10:06.233 --> 10:07.700
- HEY, MAN.

10:10.233 --> 10:12.800
LISTEN...AGAIN,
ABOUT BEFORE...

10:12.800 --> 10:14.433
I'M SORRY.

10:14.433 --> 10:16.567
- OH, YOU DON'T HAVE TO
APOLOGIZE TO ME.

10:16.567 --> 10:19.167
- RAY, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

10:30.267 --> 10:32.900
- 'SUP, SIS?

10:32.900 --> 10:35.167
- LISTEN, RAY,
ROBERT TOLD ME

10:35.167 --> 10:36.467
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
YESTERDAY,

10:36.467 --> 10:38.867
AND I JUST WANT TO
LET YOU KNOW THAT...

10:38.867 --> 10:40.300
YOU'RE RIGHT.

10:40.300 --> 10:42.533
I SHOULD HAVE REALIZED
YOU'RE JUST A GUY,

10:42.533 --> 10:45.533
AND GUYS JUST WANT
TO RELAX AND WATCH TV,

10:45.533 --> 10:47.333
AND I SHOULD HAVE
LEFT YOU ALONE.

10:47.333 --> 10:50.033
- AMY, WILL YOU MARRY ME?

10:56.500 --> 10:59.467
- YOU KNOW, LISTEN, AMY--
- OH, NO, NO, RAY.

10:59.467 --> 11:01.267
I DON'T WANT THINGS
TO BE WEIRD BETWEEN US,

11:01.267 --> 11:02.933
SO I'M SORRY.

11:02.933 --> 11:06.467
- OH, WELL...

11:06.467 --> 11:08.367
ME TOO.

11:08.367 --> 11:10.633
- GREAT.
LET'S SIT AND EAT.

11:10.633 --> 11:11.567
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

11:11.567 --> 11:15.033
I DON'T MIND IF I "FON-DO."

11:17.733 --> 11:19.767
I GOT A CHEESE ONE.

11:19.767 --> 11:21.500
- WAIT A MINUTE!

11:23.367 --> 11:26.800
THAT'S IT?
- IT'S FINE, ROBERT.

11:26.800 --> 11:29.433
- LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

11:29.433 --> 11:32.000
RAYMOND INSULTS YOU,
BUT YOU GET MAD AT ME,

11:32.000 --> 11:34.167
AND THEN YOU APOLOGIZE TO HIM?

11:34.167 --> 11:37.000
WHAT, ARE YOU TAKING
LESSONS FROM MY MOM?

11:37.933 --> 11:41.300
WHO I LOVE?

11:44.433 --> 11:46.000
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:46.000 --> 11:47.600
- I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT'S GOING ON.

11:47.600 --> 11:50.167
YESTERDAY, POOR RAYMOND
HAD TO WATCH A BASKETBALL GAME

11:50.167 --> 11:51.733
WHILE AMY DARED
TO SIT NEXT TO HIM.

11:51.733 --> 11:53.667
AND THEN THE MINUTE SHE LEAVES,
HE TELLS ME THAT

11:53.667 --> 11:55.400
SHE HAD THE NERVE
TO TALK TO HIM

11:55.400 --> 11:57.233
ABOUT THINGS
THAT DIDN'T INTEREST HIM!

11:57.233 --> 11:59.167
CALLED HER BOXY CHATTERHEAD!

11:59.167 --> 12:01.700
- RAY!
- RAYMOND!

12:01.700 --> 12:05.200
WHY WOULD YOU CALL AMY
A BOXY CHATTERHEAD?

12:05.200 --> 12:08.967
- IT'S LADY CHATTERLEY!
IT'S FROM A BOOK!

12:08.967 --> 12:11.033
- YOU KNOW, IT'S OKAY.

12:11.033 --> 12:13.233
TO BE FAIR,
RAY IS A SPORTS WRITER.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.500
IT'S KIND OF LIKE I WAS
BOTHERING HIM AT WORK.

12:15.500 --> 12:20.000
- OH, AMY, NO.
RAY DOESN'T WORK.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.367
RAY, APOLOGIZE TO AMY
RIGHT NOW.

12:22.367 --> 12:24.233
- EXCUSE ME, THIS IS
BETWEEN ME AND AMY,

12:24.233 --> 12:26.733
AND WE'RE FINE WITH IT.

12:26.733 --> 12:29.400
AMY, KUDOS ON THE FONDUE.

12:35.167 --> 12:37.333
- THIS IS NOT BETWEEN
YOU AND AMY.

12:37.333 --> 12:38.767
WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

12:38.767 --> 12:40.167
YOU NEVER LISTEN, EVER!

12:40.167 --> 12:41.667
- NEVER, EVER!

12:41.667 --> 12:44.367
- OH, DON'T TRY TO
LAY IT ALL ON RAY, ROBERT.

12:44.367 --> 12:46.000
LAST NIGHT,
YOU MADE IT VERY CLEAR

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
THAT YOU THINK
I TALK TOO MUCH.

12:48.000 --> 12:51.000
OH, DUDE.

12:54.267 --> 12:56.667
- YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO SHOULD BE IN TROUBLE!

12:56.667 --> 12:58.100
- YEAH, RAY!

12:58.100 --> 12:59.867
- YOU KNOW,
YOU WOULDN'T THINK IT,

12:59.867 --> 13:03.300
BUT THIS CHOCOLATE AND SALAMI
IS A GREAT COMBO.

13:08.367 --> 13:11.533
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S ALL JUST RELAX.

13:11.533 --> 13:13.300
I THINK WE'RE MAKING
TOO BIG OF A DEAL OF THIS.

13:13.300 --> 13:14.833
- NO, AMY, I HAVE BEEN
PUTTING UP WITH THIS

13:14.833 --> 13:16.233
FOR 15 YEARS.

13:16.233 --> 13:17.533
I AM NOT GONNA LET HIM
DO THIS TO YOU TOO.

13:17.533 --> 13:19.433
YOU KNOW, WHEN I NEED
TO TALK TO RAY

13:19.433 --> 13:22.267
ABOUT MY FEELINGS
OR OUR CHILDREN,

13:22.267 --> 13:24.467
I KNOW I HAVE UNTIL
THE COMMERCIAL'S OVER.

13:24.467 --> 13:26.400
THAT GIVES ME 30 SECONDS.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.267
AND IF THERE'S A GIRL
IN THE COMMERCIAL

13:28.267 --> 13:29.600
OR A TRUCK WITH BIG WHEELS

13:29.600 --> 13:33.767
OR, GOD FORBID,
A MONKEY, FORGET IT!

13:38.233 --> 13:39.800
- COME ON, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

13:39.800 --> 13:42.900
- LOOK, RAY, WE'RE NOT
ASKING FOR THAT MUCH.

13:42.900 --> 13:44.700
IT'S JUST TALKING
AND LISTENING--WATCH.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.733
HELLO, ROBERT.
- OH, HELLO THERE, DEBRA.

13:46.733 --> 13:48.667
- HOW'S IT GOING?
- NOT SO GOOD.

13:48.667 --> 13:53.233
I'VE GOT A BROTHER WHO LACKS
EVEN RUDIMENTARY SOCIAL SKILLS.

13:53.233 --> 13:54.733
- I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

13:54.733 --> 13:56.100
- WELL, THANKS FOR ASKING.

13:56.100 --> 13:57.833
AND BY THE WAY,
THOSE ARE LOVELY EARRINGS.

13:57.833 --> 14:01.200
- SEE?
- YEAH.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.333
- OH, THAT WAS VERY GOOD!

14:03.333 --> 14:07.067
RAYMOND,
DO IT WITH ME NOW.

14:07.067 --> 14:10.100
HELLO, RAYMOND.
- HELLO, MOTHER.

14:10.100 --> 14:13.433
OH, LOOK, MOM,
A BEAR IN PANTS.

14:15.467 --> 14:17.433
- YES, YOUR BROTHER
IS QUITE HAIRY.

14:17.433 --> 14:20.067
- NO, MA, HE'S NOT
DOING IT RIGHT.

14:20.067 --> 14:22.333
- YES, YES, HE IS, MA.
HE'S ALSO UGLY.

14:22.333 --> 14:25.400
HE SHOULD REALLY WEAR
A WELDER'S MASK.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.600
- WHY DON'T I WELD
YOUR MOUTH TO YOUR ASS

14:27.600 --> 14:29.400
AND MAKE A DOUGHNUT
OUT OF YOU?

14:29.400 --> 14:30.533
- YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO WELD!

14:30.533 --> 14:32.333
- I'M A DAMN FINE WELDER!

14:32.333 --> 14:33.733
- OH, YOU STINK AT EVERYTHING!

14:33.733 --> 14:35.567
[both shouting]

14:35.567 --> 14:37.500
- DO NOT FIGHT!

14:37.500 --> 14:39.933
THIS IS NOTHING
TO FIGHT ABOUT!

14:39.933 --> 14:42.600
- RAY, JUST APOLOGIZE
TO AMY.

14:42.600 --> 14:43.500
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.367
WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT IT.

14:45.367 --> 14:47.200
AND NOW IT JUST SEEMS
LIKE EVERYBODY'S USING IT

14:47.200 --> 14:48.533
AS AN EXCUSE TO ATTACK HIM.

14:48.533 --> 14:50.367
- YEAH, YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT!

14:50.367 --> 14:53.033
THESE JACKALS, THEY POUNCE
AS SOON AS THEY SMELL BLOOD.

14:53.033 --> 14:54.500
THEY LOVE IT
WHEN I'M MISERABLE.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.267
FOR ALL I KNOW, YOU GUYS
HAVE BEEN SENDING HER IN

14:56.267 --> 14:58.000
EVERY DAY ON PURPOSE
JUST TO ANNOY ME.

15:06.033 --> 15:08.200
- OH, AMY.

15:11.733 --> 15:14.733
- EVEN I KNOW
YOU GOT TO GO IN THERE.

15:31.600 --> 15:32.567
- HEY.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.700
WH-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:37.233 --> 15:40.167
- JUST HAVING SOME COOKIES.

15:42.533 --> 15:45.600
- LISTEN, I DIDN'T MEAN
WHAT I SAID IN THERE, REALLY.

15:45.600 --> 15:47.600
I WAS JUST--YOU KNOW,
I'M MAD AT THOSE GUYS,

15:47.600 --> 15:49.500
AND I'M SORRY.

15:50.933 --> 15:54.000
- IT'S OKAY. I'M FINE.

15:54.000 --> 15:58.167
- LISTEN, YOU DEFINITELY HAVE
A RIGHT TO BE MAD AT ME.

15:58.167 --> 15:59.400
- OH, I DO?

15:59.400 --> 16:03.100
I DO? WELL, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH, RAY.

16:03.100 --> 16:05.633
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

16:05.633 --> 16:07.367
- LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, MISTER.

16:07.367 --> 16:10.433
YOU ARE A FRUSTRATING PERSON!

16:10.433 --> 16:12.533
ALL THIS TIME, I'VE BEEN
TRYING TO TALK TO YOU,

16:12.533 --> 16:14.733
AND IT'S LIKE I'M BANGING
MY HEAD AGAINST THE WALL!

16:14.733 --> 16:16.433
I KEEP THINKING,
"WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

16:16.433 --> 16:18.200
WHY CAN'T I
GET THROUGH TO HIM?"

16:18.200 --> 16:20.433
AND NOW I REALIZE THAT
MAYBE IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

16:20.433 --> 16:22.500
MAYBE IT'S JUST THAT
YOU'RE BORING!

16:22.500 --> 16:24.767
- [gasps]

16:28.767 --> 16:31.100
- YOU KNOW, DEBRA SAYS
YOU'RE LIKE THIS

16:31.100 --> 16:33.033
BECAUSE YOU
DON'T WANT TO TALK.

16:33.033 --> 16:37.200
BUT I THINK MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
YOU'VE GOT NOTHING TO SAY!

16:38.133 --> 16:39.933
- I DO TOO HAVE STUFF TO SAY.

16:39.933 --> 16:41.333
- OH, YEAH? GO AHEAD.

16:41.333 --> 16:44.033
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- COME ON, TALK!

16:44.033 --> 16:45.933
COME ON, TALK!
RIGHT NOW!

16:45.933 --> 16:50.600
AND I WANT SOMETHING MORE THAN
HOT DOGS AND FOOTBALL KICKING!

16:50.600 --> 16:52.000
- [mumbles]

16:52.000 --> 16:54.367
- OH, INTERESTING CONVERSATION!

16:54.367 --> 16:57.333
WHAT ELSE DO YOU HAVE TO SAY,
MR. FASCINATING?

16:57.333 --> 16:59.467
- THIS IS A LOT OF PRESSURE!

16:59.467 --> 17:02.367
- THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

17:09.067 --> 17:10.600
I'M SORRY.

17:10.600 --> 17:13.767
I DIDN'T MEAN IT.
I WAS JUST LASHING OUT.

17:13.767 --> 17:15.133
OH, I STINK AT THIS.

17:15.133 --> 17:16.767
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS.

17:16.767 --> 17:19.533
- GOOD JOB.

17:19.533 --> 17:22.167
- YOU WANT A TISSUE?
- I'M NOT CRYING!

17:24.000 --> 17:27.300
- LOOK, RAY...

17:27.300 --> 17:30.267
I KNOW I TRY TOO HARD...

17:30.267 --> 17:33.200
TALKING ABOUT
EMOTIONS AND STUFF.

17:33.200 --> 17:35.433
IT'S JUST THAT
I WANT TO BE CLOSE

17:35.433 --> 17:37.767
TO EVERYONE IN THIS FAMILY.

17:39.133 --> 17:41.300
- WHY?

17:46.767 --> 17:49.033
- BECAUSE I LOVE YOU GUYS.

17:50.100 --> 17:51.433
BUT I MEAN,
FOR GOSH SAKES,

17:51.433 --> 17:53.767
I KNOW FRANK
BETTER THAN I KNOW YOU--

17:53.767 --> 17:58.700
ALL HIS SIGHTS
AND SOUNDS AND SMELLS.

17:58.700 --> 18:01.233
BUT AT LEAST I KNOW
HE'S COMFORTABLE WITH ME.

18:01.233 --> 18:03.833
I FEEL CLOSER TO HIM NOW.

18:03.833 --> 18:07.000
- YEAH, DON'T GET TOO CLOSE.

18:07.000 --> 18:10.300
WE LOST A CANARY ONCE.

18:10.300 --> 18:12.933
- YOU'RE ALWAYS SO FUNNY.

18:12.933 --> 18:14.800
YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:14.800 --> 18:16.200
IT'S TAKEN SOME TIME,

18:16.200 --> 18:18.667
BUT EVEN ROBERT
HAS STARTED OPENING UP TO ME.

18:18.667 --> 18:20.200
LIKE, HE FINALLY TOLD ME

18:20.200 --> 18:23.200
WHY HE SLEEPS WITH
A TENNIS RACKET UNDER HIS BED.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.033
- HE STILL DOES THAT?

18:25.033 --> 18:26.900
- FOR THE BURGLARS.

18:26.900 --> 18:29.200
- THAT'S WHAT
HE TOLD YOU IT'S FOR?

18:29.200 --> 18:32.200
NO, NO, NO, THAT'S...

18:32.200 --> 18:36.400
THAT'S HIS GHOST SWATTER.

18:36.400 --> 18:38.500
- WHAT?
- YES! YES!

18:38.500 --> 18:41.267
EVER SINCE WE WERE KIDS,
HE WOULD--LISTEN TO THIS.

18:41.267 --> 18:43.367
ONE TIME, HE WAS ABOUT 12,

18:43.367 --> 18:45.300
AND HE THOUGHT HE HEARD
SOMETHING IN THE ATTIC.

18:45.300 --> 18:46.767
AND SO OF COURSE,
I'M MAKING FUN OF HIM.

18:46.767 --> 18:48.433
SO TO PROVE
THAT HE'S NOT SCARED,

18:48.433 --> 18:50.833
HE WENT UP THERE
WITH HIS "GHOST SWATTER,"

18:50.833 --> 18:53.500
SO I TOOK A BROOM AND I WENT,
"BOOM, BOOM, BOOM,"

18:53.500 --> 18:55.400
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,
TWO GIANT LEGS

18:55.400 --> 18:58.467
COME CRASHING THROUGH
THE CEILING--BOOM!

18:58.467 --> 18:59.700
- JUST HIS LEGS?

18:59.700 --> 19:03.067
- YEAH, WELL, HE FELL
ON A BEAM--"AAH!"

19:04.600 --> 19:06.800
AND IT'S JUST TWO GIANT LEGS
JUST STICKING THERE,

19:06.800 --> 19:11.267
AND THEY WERE STILL
TRYING TO RUN--"AAH!"

19:11.267 --> 19:12.800
- WAS HE INJURED?

19:12.800 --> 19:15.533
- WELL, YOU TELL ME.

19:16.400 --> 19:19.567
- OH, RAY!
[laughs]

19:20.800 --> 19:23.400
- AMY, IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

19:23.400 --> 19:25.367
- YEAH, EVERYTHING'S
FINE, ROBERT.

19:25.367 --> 19:27.367
AMY AND I,
WE WERE JUST TALKING.

19:27.367 --> 19:30.333
- YEAH, WE WERE.
Ray: UH-HUH.

19:30.333 --> 19:32.600
- OH, GREAT.
WELL, THAT'S VERY NICE.

19:32.600 --> 19:34.467
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

19:34.467 --> 19:38.400
OH, PLEASE, BY ALL MEANS,
DON'T LET ME INTERRUPT.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.567
WHY AREN'T YOU TALKING?

19:51.100 --> 19:52.533
WHAT WERE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

19:52.533 --> 19:54.467
- NOTHING.
SHUT UP, REALLY.

19:54.467 --> 19:56.067
- WHAT WERE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, AMY?

19:56.067 --> 19:59.567
- FONDUE DATE NIGHT.

20:06.367 --> 20:08.433
- WAS THIS ABOUT ME?
WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM?

20:08.433 --> 20:10.300
YOU TOLD HIM STUFF ABOUT ME?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

20:10.300 --> 20:11.700
- NOTHING, ROBERT.

20:11.700 --> 20:13.900
- HE GOT STUFF OUT OF YOU.
I KNOW HIM!

20:13.900 --> 20:15.233
- ROBERT, WE WERE JUST--

20:15.233 --> 20:16.867
- HEY, COME ON, AMY,
WE SHOULD GET IN THERE.

20:16.867 --> 20:18.700
DAD'S PROBABLY GOT
THE FONDUE POT ON HIS HEAD

20:18.700 --> 20:20.000
LIKE WINNIE THE POOH.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.267
- YEAH, COME ON, ROBERT.
I'M HUNGRY.

20:21.267 --> 20:22.833
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!
DON'T LIE TO ME!

20:22.833 --> 20:25.200
IS THIS ABOUT HOW I EAT MY FOODS
IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER?

20:25.200 --> 20:27.767
BECAUSE I HAVE
A VERY GOOD REASON FOR THAT!

20:27.767 --> 20:31.367
- I DIDN'T KNOW YOU DO THAT.
- I DON'T!

20:32.700 --> 20:35.133
AMY, I DON'T WANT YOU
TALKING TO HIM.

20:35.133 --> 20:37.400
DID YOU TELL HIM
ABOUT MY PEDICURES?

20:38.433 --> 20:41.500
- NO, ROBERT.
- [gasps]

20:46.767 --> 20:49.567
Ray: ROBERT PAINTS
HIS FEET LIKE A LADY!

20:51.733 --> 20:54.100
Frank: HOLY CRAP!

21:00.767 --> 21:02.167
- THIS COMMERCIAL'S FUNNY.

21:02.167 --> 21:05.500
RIGHT, WATCH.
WATCH WHAT THE CAT DOES.

21:05.500 --> 21:07.133
[both laughing]

21:07.133 --> 21:09.433
- HE HIGH-FIVES A DOG.
THAT'S FUNNY.

21:09.433 --> 21:13.133
THOSE TWO DON'T
USUALLY GET ALONG.

21:13.133 --> 21:16.000
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST
SLEEP WITH HIM ALREADY?

21:25.733 --> 21:28.433
- I'VE BEEN SITTING HERE
ALL NIGHT TOO, YOU KNOW.

21:35.467 --> 21:38.033
- OH LOOK, THIS ONE'S
GOT A MONKEY IN IT.
