02:18.700 --> 02:21.093
Sometimes I stand looking at my wife

02:22.126 --> 02:24.484
without her knowing I'm here.

02:26.217 --> 02:30.866
The first time she
entered that room she said,

02:31.040 --> 02:33.500
"Oh, how nice. I feel at home here. "

02:34.998 --> 02:38.082
We hadn't known each other long.

02:38.258 --> 02:40.446
We met at a bishops' conference In Trondheim.

02:40.620 --> 02:43.512
She was there as a journalist.

02:44.512 --> 02:48.597
I told her about the parsonage out here.

02:49.503 --> 02:53.517
I ventured to suggest a visit

02:53.694 --> 02:55.247
when the conference was over.

02:56.921 --> 03:01.174
On the way, I asked her to marry me.

03:02.210 --> 03:08.990
She didn't answer, but when
we entered the room she said,

03:09.427 --> 03:12.014
"Oh, how nice. I feel at home here. "

03:14.650 --> 03:19.594
Since then we've lived a quiet,
happy Iife at the parsonage.

03:20.039 --> 03:23.192
Eva has, of course, told
me about her earlier life.

03:24.031 --> 03:28.783
After leaving school she went on to college

03:28.953 --> 03:33.807
got engaged to a doctor and
lived with him for several years.

03:35.373 --> 03:38.957
Wrote two small books.

03:39.398 --> 03:43.378
Came down with tuberculosis,
broke offthe engagement

03:43.556 --> 03:48.639
and moved from Oslo to a small
town In the south of Norway

03:48.980 --> 03:51.963
where she began to work as a journalist.

03:53.071 --> 03:57.392
This is the first of her
books. I like it so much.

03:58.061 --> 03:59.920
She has written,

04:01.853 --> 04:07.104
"One must learn to live.
I practice every day.

04:07.274 --> 04:11.493
" My biggest obstacle
is I don't know who I am.

04:11.665 --> 04:13.355
"I grope blindly.

04:14.127 --> 04:17.144
"If anyone loves me as I am

04:17.320 --> 04:20.608
"I may dare at last to look at myself.

04:21.676 --> 04:26.656
" For me, that possibility is fairly remote."

04:31.790 --> 04:35.441
I'd like to tell her just for once

04:35.614 --> 04:39.594
that she is loved whole-heartedly

04:40.704 --> 04:43.563
but I can't say it in such a way

04:43.732 --> 04:48.019
that she'd believe me. I
can't find the right words.

05:15.166 --> 05:18.127
I've written to Mama. Am I interrupting?

05:18.293 --> 05:24.077
- No, no. Come in. I'll turn offthe radio.
- I can come back later.

05:24.247 --> 05:26.505
No, please read me the letter.

05:27.739 --> 05:32.389
" Dearest Mama, I was in town
yesterday and ran into Agnes

05:32.564 --> 05:36.283
"who was on a visit to her parents.

05:36.453 --> 05:38.643
"She told me Leonardo had died.

05:39.516 --> 05:45.029
"I know what a terrible
blow this must be to you.

05:45.205 --> 05:47.292
"I'm wondering now if you'd
like to come and visit us

05:47.467 --> 05:50.983
"for a few days or weeks.

05:51.991 --> 05:55.178
"So that you won't say no right off

05:55.351 --> 05:58.310
"the parsonage is very spacious.

05:58.477 --> 06:01.800
"You'll have your own
room with all conveniences.

06:02.401 --> 06:06.414
"We have a piano and you
can practice all you want to.

06:06.593 --> 06:09.811
"It would make a change from a hotel.

06:10.418 --> 06:12.777
" Do say you'll come!

06:12.947 --> 06:16.995
"We'll make a fuss over you and spoil you.

06:17.170 --> 06:20.187
"It's ages since we last met.

06:20.364 --> 06:22.257
"7 years this October!

06:22.758 --> 06:25.719
" Much love from Viktor and Eva."

06:25.885 --> 06:27.780
- That's fine.
- Are you sure?

07:23.998 --> 07:29.079
- Mama darling!
- Eva! Well, here I am!

07:29.255 --> 07:33.768
- I'm so glad you're here.
- Yes,just fancy. It was a long trip.

07:33.944 --> 07:38.731
- Yes, I know.
- How beautiful it is here!

07:38.901 --> 07:42.089
- Do stay a long time.
- Indeed I will.

07:42.261 --> 07:47.376
- I can't believe you're here.
- Let's go for a nice long walk.

07:47.546 --> 07:51.595
- What heavy bags! Have you brought all your music?
- Yes,

07:51.775 --> 07:54.666
I'm staying for good! -It would be nice.

07:54.835 --> 07:58.351
- You'll give me some lessons,won't you?
- Yes.

07:58.527 --> 08:01.043
Where's Viktor? -He's not
at home for the moment.

08:01.221 --> 08:04.805
We didn't think you'd come so early.

08:05.613 --> 08:07.767
- This is your room.
- Oh, isn't it nice!

08:08.805 --> 08:13.161
And what a beautiful
view. -The bathroom's here.

08:14.594 --> 08:21.070
- How nice and up-to-date. -I
hope one wardrobe is enough.

08:21.246 --> 08:24.930
Everything's fine. I really am very tired.

08:25.104 --> 08:29.857
I sat with Leonardo the last day and night.

08:30.027 --> 08:33.147
He was in bad pain and was
given shots every two hours.

08:33.952 --> 08:38.672
Now and then he cried because it hurt.

08:38.845 --> 08:40.273
He wasn't afraid of dying.

08:41.239 --> 08:46.218
Outside the hospital they
were drilling and hammering.

08:46.395 --> 08:51.374
The sun was blazing down
and there were no awnings.

08:51.917 --> 08:57.100
We tried to get another room but
many wards were closed for repairs.

08:58.138 --> 09:01.688
Towards evening the noise stopped
and I could open the window.

09:01.863 --> 09:06.976
The heat outside was like a
wall, and not a breath of wind.

09:08.980 --> 09:12.870
In the evening the doctor
came. He's an old friend.

09:14.368 --> 09:17.022
He said it wouldn't be long now.

09:17.994 --> 09:24.006
Leonardo would get a shot every half
- hour so he could die without pain.

09:25.243 --> 09:28.001
Then the doctor left and
the ward nurse came in.

09:30.136 --> 09:32.927
She said I should eat, but I wasn't hungry.

09:34.259 --> 09:36.689
The smell was making me sick.

09:39.053 --> 09:41.479
Leonardo dozed off

09:43.010 --> 09:48.157
then woke up and asked
me to go out of the room.

09:49.228 --> 09:53.152
He rang for the night nurse
and she came in with a shot.

09:55.485 --> 09:59.771
A minute or two later she came out and said

10:01.172 --> 10:02.896
Leonardo was dead.

10:08.191 --> 10:10.516
I sat with him all night.

10:11.882 --> 10:14.741
He had been my friend for 18 years.

10:14.910 --> 10:20.331
We had lived together for thirteen
and had never had an angry word.

10:22.294 --> 10:25.345
For two years he had known he was
ill and that there was no hope.

10:26.953 --> 10:30.810
As often as I could I went to
see him at his villa near Naples.

10:32.974 --> 10:38.259
He was kind and thoughtful
and happy about my success.

10:39.124 --> 10:43.516
We talked and joked and played chamber music.

10:45.081 --> 10:50.090
He hardly ever spoke of his illness
and he wouldn't have liked me to ask.

11:30.917 --> 11:33.937
One day he gave me a long look

11:35.212 --> 11:37.865
then laughed and said:

11:39.832 --> 11:43.658
"This time next year I'll be gone

11:44.891 --> 11:49.472
"but I'll always be with you.
I'll always think of you."

11:52.874 --> 11:57.230
It was sweet of him to say so

11:57.398 --> 11:59.189
but he was apt to be rather theatrical.

12:00.391 --> 12:02.976
I can't say I go around grieving.

12:03.717 --> 12:07.402
Of course he's left a gap,
but it's no good fretting.

12:07.575 --> 12:10.626
Do you think I've changed much?

12:10.802 --> 12:14.850
- You're just the same.
- I dye my hair of course.

12:15.026 --> 12:17.851
Otherwise I'm the same, don't you think?

12:18.020 --> 12:22.410
I bought this outfit in
Z'rich. Saw it in a window

12:22.578 --> 12:26.469
went in and tried it on and it fit perfectly.

12:26.638 --> 12:30.652
- Don't you think it's nice?
- Yes, very.

12:30.828 --> 12:34.877
Will you help me with this
case? My back's giving me hell.

12:36.150 --> 12:40.075
Have you a board to put under the mattress?

12:40.242 --> 12:43.599
We put one there yesterday.

12:44.201 --> 12:49.746
Eva dear, what is it? Have
I said something wrong?

12:49.922 --> 12:52.576
I'm just so glad to see you.

12:53.979 --> 12:57.530
Give me a nice squeezy hug, as
you did when you were little.

12:58.837 --> 13:02.454
I've done nothing but chattered about myself.

13:02.861 --> 13:06.785
Tell me about you. How are things?

13:06.953 --> 13:12.068
- Oh, fine.
- Don't you lead a very isolated life?

13:12.241 --> 13:17.220
- No, we have our parish work.
- Yes, of course.

13:17.398 --> 13:22.377
I often play the organ. Last
month I had a musical evening.

13:22.555 --> 13:27.909
I played and talked about each piece.

13:28.077 --> 13:32.022
- I hope you'll play for me.
- I'd love to.

13:32.200 --> 13:34.522
I gave five school concerts in Los Angeles.

13:34.695 --> 13:37.746
3,000 children each time.

13:37.923 --> 13:43.208
I played and talked to
them. I was a huge success.

13:43.378 --> 13:45.703
There's something I have to tell you.

13:46.571 --> 13:48.157
Helena is here.

13:57.946 --> 14:00.033
You should have told me.

14:01.140 --> 14:04.894
If I had, you wouldn't have come.

14:05.065 --> 14:07.220
I'm sure I would have.

14:07.393 --> 14:09.288
And I'm sure you wouldn't.

14:10.087 --> 14:15.635
Isn't Leonardo's death enough?
Why drag poor Lena here too?

14:15.810 --> 14:18.736
She's been here for the last two years.

14:19.635 --> 14:23.888
Viktor and I asked her if
she'd like to live with us.

14:25.623 --> 14:29.140
- I wrote to you.
- I never got the letter.

14:29.313 --> 14:31.278
Or else you never bothered to read it.

14:32.776 --> 14:36.722
- Aren't you being rather unfair?
- Yes. I'm sorry.

14:39.429 --> 14:42.649
I'm not up to seeing her.
At any rate not today.

14:43.751 --> 14:48.176
Helena is a wonderful person.

14:48.343 --> 14:54.093
She's longing to see you. -It
seemed so nice for her at that home.

14:54.264 --> 14:58.415
- I wanted her with me.
- Are you sure she's better off here?

14:58.588 --> 15:02.239
Yes. And I have someone to look after.

15:03.344 --> 15:10.058
Has she... I mean is she... Is she worse?

15:10.595 --> 15:14.278
Oh yes, she's worse.
It's part of the disease.

15:18.513 --> 15:20.169
Come along then, let's go and see her.

15:23.403 --> 15:26.091
- Are you sure?
- I have no choice.

15:28.792 --> 15:32.014
Some people are so naive.

15:32.817 --> 15:36.207
- You mean me?
- If the shoe fits.

15:50.646 --> 15:53.130
Dear Lena!

15:54.904 --> 15:59.622
I've thought of you so often, every day.

16:05.814 --> 16:09.037
Helena is afraid of giving you her cold.

16:09.208 --> 16:13.325
I haven't had a cold for twenty years.

16:15.195 --> 16:18.384
What a lovely room you have!

16:18.556 --> 16:20.541
I have the same view from my room.

16:31.727 --> 16:34.653
Helena wants you to take her head

16:34.821 --> 16:38.438
in your hands. -Like that?

16:42.040 --> 16:45.895
I'm so glad Eva's looking after you.

16:46.061 --> 16:50.612
I thought you were still at that
home. I would have come to visit.

16:50.788 --> 16:52.873
But it's much better like this, isn't it?

16:53.978 --> 16:56.169
Now we can be together every day.

16:58.835 --> 17:04.348
- Are you in pain?
- No.

17:07.319 --> 17:18.857
- How nicely you've done your hair.
- It's in your honor.

17:19.496 --> 17:24.713
Suppose I read aloud to
you? Would you like that?

17:26.083 --> 17:30.630
And we can go for a drive. I've
never been around here before.

17:35.628 --> 17:38.850
- What?
- Helena says you must be awfully tired

17:39.021 --> 17:41.210
and not to make any more effort today.

17:51.093 --> 17:53.648
Well done, Mama.

17:53.820 --> 17:58.009
- Doesn't Lena have a
wristwatch? I'll give you mine.

17:58.180 --> 18:00.405
It was a gift from an admirer

18:00.577 --> 18:03.627
who said I was always late.

18:04.834 --> 18:09.017
Will Lena be having dinner
with us? -No, she's on a diet.

18:09.956 --> 18:14.573
She ate far too much at the hospital.

18:20.402 --> 18:22.228
Why do I feel like I have a temperature?

18:23.463 --> 18:25.084
Why do I want to cry?

18:26.523 --> 18:31.570
I'm to be put to shame, that's the idea.

18:31.744 --> 18:35.499
Then a guilty conscience.
Always a guilty conscience!

18:38.232 --> 18:42.155
I was in such a hurry to get
here. What was I expecting?

18:42.323 --> 18:46.475
What was I longing for so desperately?

18:47.711 --> 18:50.569
This extraordinary mother!

18:51.371 --> 18:55.419
You should have seen her
when I told her Lena was here.

18:55.594 --> 18:59.984
She actually managed to produce a smile

19:00.151 --> 19:02.443
despite her surprise and alarm.

19:03.213 --> 19:08.430
And as we stood outside Lena's
door: an actress before her entrance,

19:08.600 --> 19:12.788
scared but in control.
The performance was superb.

19:14.225 --> 19:16.778
Why on earth did she come here?

19:16.952 --> 19:21.773
What did she expect of a meeting
after 7 years? What did she expect?

19:21.941 --> 19:27.363
- I wonder.
- And what did I expect? Does one never stop hoping?

19:27.527 --> 19:31.351
- I don't think so.
- Always mother and daughter!

19:32.052 --> 19:35.807
No use starting to cry. Damn it!

19:37.341 --> 19:40.268
There she sat, gazing
at me with her big eyes.

19:43.062 --> 19:46.986
I held her face and felt the disease

19:47.155 --> 19:49.808
twitching at her throat muscles.

19:51.576 --> 19:53.041
Damn it!

19:55.271 --> 19:57.924
To think I can't carry her to my bed

19:58.099 --> 20:00.287
and comfort her as I did when she was three.

20:08.441 --> 20:11.133
That soft, torn body

20:13.501 --> 20:15.123
that's my Lena!

20:20.453 --> 20:22.211
Don't cry, for Christ's sake.

20:23.081 --> 20:26.266
A writer whose name I've forgotten said,

20:26.441 --> 20:29.364
" It's like a ghost falling on top of you

20:29.534 --> 20:32.290
"when you open the door to the nursery

20:32.459 --> 20:35.576
"having long since
forgotten it is the nursery."

20:37.052 --> 20:41.873
- Do you think I'm grown up?
- I guess being grown up is being able

20:42.042 --> 20:48.789
to handle your dreams and hopes.
Not longing. -Do you think so?

20:50.023 --> 20:52.213
Maybe you stop being surprised.

20:53.850 --> 20:57.898
How sensible you look, with your old pipe.

20:58.074 --> 21:03.223
- You're quite grown up.
- I wonder. I'm surprised every day.

21:03.397 --> 21:06.353
- At what?
- At you.

21:06.522 --> 21:11.276
And I have the most
unreasonable dreams and hopes.

21:11.448 --> 21:14.770
And a longing too, come to that.

21:14.939 --> 21:17.423
- Longing?
- Yes. I long for you.

21:18.097 --> 21:20.991
Those are very pretty words.

21:21.160 --> 21:23.383
Words that don't mean anything real.

21:24.254 --> 21:26.874
I was brought up with beautiful words.

21:27.045 --> 21:31.561
Mama is never furious or
disappointed or unhappy

21:31.737 --> 21:35.855
she is "pained". You have a
lot of words like that too.

21:36.993 --> 21:39.453
It's a kind of occupational disease.

21:40.553 --> 21:44.133
If you long for me when I'm here,

21:44.311 --> 21:47.566
I begin to be suspicious.
- You know what I mean.

21:47.737 --> 21:53.250
No. If I knew, it would never
enter your head to say so.

21:54.125 --> 21:57.516
I must see to the veal roast.

21:57.684 --> 22:01.437
Mama thinks I'm a hopeless cook.

22:01.610 --> 22:05.229
- Mama thinks you're a...
- ...wonderful cook. Thank you!

22:07.131 --> 22:10.148
And she's to have decaffeinated coffee.

22:11.456 --> 22:16.433
I'll cut my visit short.
I can manage four days.

22:16.612 --> 22:19.164
Then I'll go to Africa
as I originally planned.

22:24.728 --> 22:29.049
This hurts, Charlotte.
It hurts. Hurts. Hurts.

22:29.817 --> 22:35.295
I've often wondered why she
sleeps badly. Now I know.

22:35.471 --> 22:40.292
If that woman slept normally,
her vitality would crush everyone.

22:40.460 --> 22:45.438
Her insomnia is nature's way
of using up the surplus energy.

22:46.714 --> 22:52.398
I'll put on my red dress just to spite Eva.

22:52.570 --> 22:55.757
I'm sure she thinks I
ought to be in mourning.

22:56.362 --> 23:00.977
See how carefully she dresses for dinner.

23:01.151 --> 23:08.038
Her dress will be a discreet
reminder that she's a lonely widow.

23:09.435 --> 23:16.013
I'm angry the whole time. Viktor
and Eva have been sweet to me.

23:16.188 --> 23:21.633
Viktor's a kindly soul.
Lucky for Eva, the cry-baby.

23:21.807 --> 23:24.362
I don't suppose the shower works.

23:25.567 --> 23:26.688
Yes, it does!

23:40.603 --> 23:44.358
- What a lovely dress!
- Does it suit me?

23:44.529 --> 23:48.475
One day I met a friend who said,

23:48.654 --> 23:51.172
"I've just come from a fashion show.

23:51.347 --> 23:54.138
"There was a divine red dress
which is absolutely you!"

23:54.308 --> 23:58.459
To your health, Charlotte. We're
delighted to have you with us.

24:28.137 --> 24:31.325
Eva, see if I left my glasses on the table.

24:40.810 --> 24:41.966
Thank you, darling.

25:48.139 --> 25:53.083
That was my agent, he's so sweet.
The only friend I have left.

25:53.258 --> 25:58.183
You remember him. Old Paul. We've
worked together now for 30 years.

25:59.445 --> 26:05.890
What a fine old instrument! What
a lovely tone! And just tuned.

26:06.067 --> 26:07.996
Now I'm really happy.

26:09.495 --> 26:12.512
I didn't need to worry.
- What do you mean, Mama?

26:12.686 --> 26:16.736
I was nervous of seeing you
again after so many years.

26:16.912 --> 26:19.305
I nearly didn't come.

26:19.474 --> 26:23.057
This peculiar coffee is a bore

26:23.232 --> 26:25.023
but what can I do when I can't sleep?

26:26.459 --> 26:29.317
I see you're working on the Chopin preludes.

26:29.482 --> 26:32.207
Play something. -Not now.

26:32.380 --> 26:37.857
Don't be childish. You'd
give me great pleasure.

26:38.035 --> 26:41.824
But you wanted your mother to hear you.

26:41.994 --> 26:46.609
But it's all a sham. I have no technique.

26:46.784 --> 26:51.670
I haven't even bothered
to learn the fingering.

26:51.840 --> 26:54.824
Darling, no more excuses. Come on now, play.

28:49.194 --> 28:50.749
Eva, my dearest.

28:52.356 --> 28:55.474
- Is that all?
- I was just so moved.

28:56.714 --> 28:58.899
- Did you like it?
- I liked you.

29:00.107 --> 29:04.154
- I don't follow.
- Play something else.

29:04.331 --> 29:07.016
- What was wrong?
- Nothing.

29:07.924 --> 29:11.314
You didn't like my interpretation.

29:11.482 --> 29:16.405
- We all have our own.
- Exactly. I want to know yours.

29:17.469 --> 29:23.615
- You're cross.
- No, I'm upset. You won't tell me your idea

29:23.791 --> 29:27.113
of this prelude. -All right, if you insist.

29:28.614 --> 29:32.370
Your technique wasn't at all
bad though you might have taken

29:32.539 --> 29:36.588
more interest in Cortot's fingering.

29:36.764 --> 29:41.618
But let's just talk about the conception.

29:42.285 --> 29:46.764
Chopin was emotional, but not mawkish.

29:46.943 --> 29:49.903
Feeling is very far from sentimentality.

29:50.070 --> 29:56.216
The prelude tells of pain, not reverie.

29:56.390 --> 30:00.178
You have to be calm, clear and harsh.

30:00.347 --> 30:02.243
Take the first bars now.

30:05.103 --> 30:08.258
It hurts, but he doesn't show it.

30:09.728 --> 30:11.811
Then a short relief.

30:14.984 --> 30:19.464
But it evaporates at once,

30:19.640 --> 30:21.965
and the pain is the same.

30:26.327 --> 30:28.788
Total restraint the whole time.

30:29.787 --> 30:33.836
Chopin was proud, passionate,

30:34.011 --> 30:39.228
tormented and very manly. He
wasn't a mawkish old woman.

30:39.400 --> 30:43.582
This prelude must be
made to sound almost ugly.

30:43.757 --> 30:46.979
It is never ingratiating.
It should sound wrong.

30:47.152 --> 30:50.599
You have to battle your way
through it and emerge triumphant.

30:51.439 --> 30:54.198
Like this.

33:29.481 --> 33:30.704
I see.

33:33.070 --> 33:38.393
- Don't be cross with me.
- Why should I be? On the contrary.

33:38.562 --> 33:41.749
For 45 years I've worked
at these terrible preludes.

33:42.520 --> 33:46.501
They still contain a lot of secrets.

33:48.308 --> 33:50.928
When I was little, I admired you enormously.

33:51.702 --> 33:54.718
Then I got pretty tired
of you and your pianos.

33:56.391 --> 33:59.612
Now I admire you again,
but in a different way.

34:00.713 --> 34:03.697
- Then there's some hope.
- Yes, I guess so.

34:17.746 --> 34:21.228
- Where are you?
- I'm up here, Mama.

34:30.119 --> 34:33.908
I've changed, so we can
go for a walk if you like.

34:34.610 --> 34:37.831
- Is this the nursery?
- Yes, it's Erik's room.

34:39.368 --> 34:44.654
- Fancy letting it stay like this!
- We've often talked of altering it.

34:44.822 --> 34:51.934
Sometimes I come and sit here
and let my thoughts wander.

34:52.109 --> 34:56.293
- Let's go.
- Wait, Mama! Feel the nice atmosphere in here.

34:59.559 --> 35:03.211
Erik drowned the day
before his fourth birthday.

35:03.383 --> 35:04.972
But you know that.

35:05.647 --> 35:09.798
It was too much for Viktor.

35:09.971 --> 35:12.862
I grieved a lot, outwardly.

35:13.031 --> 35:16.321
Deep inside, I felt he was still alive,

35:17.324 --> 35:19.614
that we were living close to each other.

35:21.114 --> 35:24.664
All I have to do is
concentrate, and he's there.

35:25.573 --> 35:31.459
Sometimes, as I'm falling asleep
I can feel him breathing on my face

35:31.627 --> 35:34.245
and touching me with his hand.

35:35.219 --> 35:38.939
He's living another life,
but we can reach one another.

35:39.112 --> 35:42.265
There's no dividing line,
no insurmountable wall.

35:43.668 --> 35:48.920
I wonder what the reality looks
like where my little boy is living.

35:49.092 --> 35:52.175
I know it can't be described.

35:52.351 --> 35:56.003
It's a world of liberated feelings.

35:56.974 --> 35:58.458
Do you know what I mean?

35:59.501 --> 36:02.982
To me, man is a tremendous creation,

36:03.160 --> 36:06.085
an inconceivable thought.

36:06.254 --> 36:10.439
In man is everything, from
the highest to the lowest.

36:10.612 --> 36:14.763
Man is God's image, and
in God there is everything.

36:15.968 --> 36:21.478
So human beings are
created, but also the demons

36:21.655 --> 36:26.669
and the saints, the prophets
and artists and iconoclasts.

36:26.845 --> 36:29.895
Everything exists side by side.

36:30.071 --> 36:34.994
It's like huge patterns
changing all the time.

36:35.163 --> 36:40.107
In the same way, there must
also be countless realities

36:40.284 --> 36:43.730
not only the reality we
perceive with our dull senses

36:43.910 --> 36:50.794
but a tumult of realities arching
above each other inside and outside.

36:51.860 --> 36:55.149
It's just fear and priggishness
to believe in limits.

36:56.351 --> 37:01.103
There are no limits. Neither to thoughts

37:01.273 --> 37:02.996
nor to feelings.

37:04.499 --> 37:10.284
It's anxiety that sets limits.

37:10.456 --> 37:14.708
When you play the slow movement
of the Hammerklavier sonata

37:14.879 --> 37:20.164
you must feel you're living
in a world without limitations

37:20.334 --> 37:25.382
in an activity you can
never see through or explore.

37:27.619 --> 37:30.442
Let's go for a walk before it gets too dark.

37:55.594 --> 37:59.382
I thought I heard Helena calling. Excuse me.

38:02.113 --> 38:06.729
I think Eva is awfully unhappy.

38:06.905 --> 38:11.826
I'm appalled when I hear her
holding forth. It's so neurotic.

38:11.994 --> 38:14.920
Just a moment, Charlotte

38:15.087 --> 38:19.340
and I'll try to explain how I view my wife.

38:21.872 --> 38:26.885
When I asked Eva to marry me,
she said she didn't love me.

38:27.061 --> 38:30.951
- What do you mean?
- I asked if she loved someone else.

38:31.753 --> 38:36.040
She said she had never loved anyone,

38:36.210 --> 38:38.898
that she was incapable of loving.

38:43.061 --> 38:50.343
Eva and I lived here for several
years. Then Erik was born.

38:50.946 --> 38:57.353
We'd given up hope of a child of
our own and talked of adopting one.

38:57.531 --> 39:04.008
With her pregnancy, Eva
underwent a complete change.

39:04.185 --> 39:09.696
She became cheerful, gentle and outgoing.

39:11.002 --> 39:14.122
She got lazy and couldn't be bothered

39:14.297 --> 39:18.244
with her parish work or her piano-playing.

39:18.421 --> 39:20.780
She would sit by that window
gazing at the play of light

39:20.950 --> 39:24.103
over the fell and the fjord.

39:27.005 --> 39:29.057
We were suddenly very happy.

39:30.265 --> 39:33.746
I'm much older than Eva.

39:33.922 --> 39:37.349
I felt as if a gray film
were settling over life.

39:37.517 --> 39:42.597
I felt as if I could look back and say,

39:42.772 --> 39:46.594
"Well, well, so that was my life,
that's how it all turned out."

39:52.118 --> 39:57.006
But suddenly things were different.

40:01.133 --> 40:07.077
Please forgive me, but
it's still rather hard to...

40:12.209 --> 40:18.924
Yes. We had some years
that were very rich. Erik.

40:23.188 --> 40:27.167
You should have seen Eva.

40:27.344 --> 40:30.430
At the time of Erik's birth

40:30.605 --> 40:33.894
I was recording all the Mozart sonatas.

40:34.063 --> 40:36.786
- I hadn't one day free.
- No.

40:36.958 --> 40:39.850
We invited you over and over again.

40:41.782 --> 40:45.400
When Erik drowned, that
gray film got even grayer.

40:46.639 --> 40:50.824
For Eva it was different.

40:50.996 --> 40:56.883
- Different?
- Her feeling lives, uncorroded.

40:57.048 --> 40:58.637
Or so it seems anyway.

41:00.410 --> 41:07.883
If she feels that her
son is alive and near her,

41:09.091 --> 41:11.485
well, perhaps that's how it is.

41:12.319 --> 41:15.336
She seldom speaks of it.

41:15.512 --> 41:17.904
I guess she's afraid it might upset me

41:18.074 --> 41:19.730
as indeed it would.

41:21.034 --> 41:23.892
But what she says sounds true enough.

41:25.326 --> 41:29.612
- I believe her.
- Yes, you're a minister.

41:30.415 --> 41:36.629
- My faith lives on her terms.
- I'm sorry if I hurt you.

41:36.802 --> 41:40.624
It doesn't matter. Unlike you and Eva,

41:40.794 --> 41:44.275
I'm diffuse and uncertain. It's my own fault.

41:44.451 --> 41:48.070
I think I'll take a good dose
of sleeping pills tonight.

41:52.634 --> 41:56.650
It's so peaceful here, only the
hiss of the rain on the roof.

41:57.824 --> 42:01.045
- Do you have all you need?
- Couldn't be better.

42:01.216 --> 42:05.199
Cookies and mineral water, tape recorder,

42:05.375 --> 42:09.061
two detective novels, my blindfold and ear
- plugs

42:09.234 --> 42:12.386
and my travel blanket.

42:12.561 --> 42:16.007
Like to taste my delicious Swiss chocolate?

42:16.186 --> 42:20.802
- You can have two pieces.
- I don't like chocolate.

42:20.978 --> 42:24.765
I seem to remember you were
crazy about candy as a child.

42:25.567 --> 42:30.782
- Helena liked it. I didn't.
- Good, all the more for me.

42:30.956 --> 42:33.609
- Good night, Mama.
- Good night, my pet.

42:33.784 --> 42:38.330
Viktor is a delightful person.
You must take care of him.

42:38.507 --> 42:44.358
- I do.
- Are you happy together?

42:44.528 --> 42:47.973
Do you get on well?
- Viktor is my best friend.

42:48.153 --> 42:50.943
I can't imagine life without him.

42:52.044 --> 42:56.094
- He said you didn't love him.
- Did he say that?

42:56.270 --> 43:01.023
- Yes. Why?
- Oh,just rather surprising.

43:01.193 --> 43:02.815
Was it a secret?

43:04.419 --> 43:08.604
But he shouldn't have said it?
- He's not the confiding sort.

43:08.777 --> 43:13.665
- We were talking about you.
- If you want to know anything, ask me.

43:13.833 --> 43:18.052
I'll answer truthfully.
- Now, don't get upset.

43:18.223 --> 43:22.377
A mother naturally
worries about her daughter.

43:22.549 --> 43:26.767
We spoke of you with the greatest affection.

43:26.939 --> 43:30.591
If only you'd leave people alone!

43:30.764 --> 43:33.883
I've left you alone far too long.

43:34.057 --> 43:39.273
- You're right.
- Give me a hug. Promise you're not angry.

43:39.445 --> 43:42.031
- I'm not.
- I love you, don't you see.

43:42.207 --> 43:43.568
I love you too.

43:44.835 --> 43:47.919
It's not much fun being alone always.

43:49.092 --> 43:51.113
I envy you and Viktor.

43:51.987 --> 43:57.466
Now that Leonardo's dead,
I'm so awfully lonely.

43:57.642 --> 44:00.261
Don't you see? -Yes.

44:00.437 --> 44:04.191
I'll begin to weep with
self-pity in a minute.

44:04.361 --> 44:07.117
This book isn't at all bad.

44:07.289 --> 44:10.610
It's by Adam Kretzinsky.
Have you heard of him?

44:11.247 --> 44:14.763
I met him in Madrid. Mad as a hatter.

44:14.940 --> 44:18.093
I couldn't defend myself. In fact, I didn't.

44:19.098 --> 44:22.920
- Shall I put out this light?
- Yes, please.

44:24.984 --> 44:28.104
- I'll bring your breakfast.
- Don't trouble yourself.

44:28.278 --> 44:31.830
- But I want to spoil you.
- Very well, if you insist.

44:32.802 --> 44:37.193
Strong coffee, hot milk, two
slices of German bread with cheese,

44:37.359 --> 44:41.907
one slice of toast with honey.

44:42.082 --> 44:44.908
- And orange juice.
- I nearly forgot.

44:45.077 --> 44:47.267
I can... -Juice it will be.

44:47.440 --> 44:50.660
Good night, darling. -Good night, Mama.

45:14.382 --> 45:17.365
I think I'll have a look at my accounts.

45:18.308 --> 45:21.857
I'll have Brammer invest
the money from Leonardo.

45:23.964 --> 45:26.922
The house is worth quite a bit too.

45:27.088 --> 45:30.515
You never bothered about money.

45:30.683 --> 45:32.701
You were above mundane worries

45:34.041 --> 45:36.401
and left all problems to your Charlotte.

45:38.033 --> 45:44.783
3,735,866 francs.

45:46.949 --> 45:50.374
To think you had so much
money. Who'd have thought it?

45:53.435 --> 45:56.485
And you leave it all to your old Charlotte.

45:59.523 --> 46:01.813
I've got a little nest egg, too.

46:04.346 --> 46:07.306
Together, it comes to over five million.

46:08.437 --> 46:10.160
What am I going to do with so much money?

46:11.231 --> 46:15.089
I'll buy a nice car for Viktor and Eva.

46:15.257 --> 46:19.272
They can't drive around
in that old rattle-trap.

46:19.449 --> 46:22.498
On Monday we'll go into
town and look at a new car.

46:23.074 --> 46:28.222
It'll cheer them up. Me too.

46:28.395 --> 46:33.250
"She offered him the red
flower of her virginity.

46:33.418 --> 46:36.139
" He accepted it without enthusiasm..."

46:38.940 --> 46:42.627
What trash!

46:43.664 --> 46:47.678
Adam was quite an idiot, he was,

46:47.854 --> 46:50.814
even if he did nearly
commit suicide because of me.

46:55.074 --> 46:59.654
Supposing I buy a new car for
myself and give them the Mercedes?

47:00.195 --> 47:04.380
Then I can fly to Paris

47:04.553 --> 47:10.531
and buy a car there and won't
have to drive all that way.

47:11.241 --> 47:14.166
Tomorrow, I must get down to Ravel.

47:14.898 --> 47:20.444
It's disgraceful how lazy I've been of late.

48:18.134 --> 48:20.595
Mama, what's happened?

48:21.294 --> 48:24.946
I heard you call out, and
you were not in your room.

48:25.119 --> 48:30.303
I'm sorry to wake you, but
I had such a horrible dream...

48:31.172 --> 48:35.030
I can't remember it.
- Shall I keep you company?

48:35.199 --> 48:40.143
No thank you, dear. You go back to bed.

48:40.321 --> 48:41.579
Very well.

48:45.378 --> 48:48.497
- You do like me, don't you?
- You are my mother.

48:50.002 --> 48:51.725
That's one way of answering.

49:02.142 --> 49:05.034
- Do you like me?
- I love you.

49:05.203 --> 49:06.826
Do you?

49:07.465 --> 49:12.048
I broke off my career to stay
at home with you and Papa.

49:12.223 --> 49:17.542
Your back prevented you from
practicing six hours a day.

49:17.710 --> 49:22.327
Your playing got worse
and so did your reviews.

49:22.502 --> 49:25.890
Have you forgotten it? -No, but Eva...

49:26.058 --> 49:28.282
I don't know which I hated more

49:28.454 --> 49:31.244
when you were at home
or when you were on tour.

49:32.378 --> 49:36.237
I realize now you made
life hell for Papa and me.

49:36.404 --> 49:39.387
Your father and I were very happy.

49:39.566 --> 49:42.922
I'd have done anything for him.

49:43.091 --> 49:48.875
- You were unfaithful to him.
- I was not!

49:49.046 --> 49:52.163
I was quite honest with Josef.

49:52.339 --> 49:55.264
I fell in love with Martin and
lived with him for 8 months.

49:56.862 --> 50:02.907
It wasn't a bed of roses. -It was I who
had to sit with Papa in the evenings.

50:03.081 --> 50:09.094
It was I who had to comfort him to
keep repeating that you did love him

50:09.271 --> 50:11.991
just the same, that you
were sure to come back.

50:13.894 --> 50:17.546
I read your letters out loud.

50:17.720 --> 50:22.166
Your long, loving, amusing
letters in which you told us

50:22.343 --> 50:24.429
of your interesting travels.

50:26.167 --> 50:30.558
We sat there like two
idiots reading your letters

50:30.727 --> 50:35.410
over and over. We thought a more
wonderful person didn't exist.

50:36.747 --> 50:40.727
You hate me.

50:45.994 --> 50:52.673
I don't know. I looked
forward so much to your coming.

50:52.846 --> 50:54.831
I don't know what I was imagining.

50:56.071 --> 50:59.054
Maybe I thought you were lonely and sad.

50:59.665 --> 51:01.752
I'm so confused.

51:02.760 --> 51:07.374
I thought I was grown up and
could look clearly at you and me

51:07.548 --> 51:09.908
and Helena's illness and our childhood.

51:12.804 --> 51:15.264
Now it's all one big muddle.

51:34.328 --> 51:38.148
It's all right now. Wake up.

51:48.630 --> 51:52.056
I'll sit here with you until you go to sleep.

52:58.452 --> 53:02.501
To you, I was a doll you
played with when you had time.

53:04.439 --> 53:08.794
If I was sick or naughty, you
handed me overtoyour nursemaid.

53:10.859 --> 53:13.978
You shutyourself in and worked,

53:14.153 --> 53:15.944
andno one was allowed to disturb you.

53:16.914 --> 53:19.137
I used to stand outside, listening.

53:20.140 --> 53:24.689
When you'd stop for coffee, I'd
go in to see ifyou really existed.

53:25.829 --> 53:29.719
You were always kind,
butyour mind was elsewhere.

53:31.150 --> 53:33.772
If I spoke, you'd hardly answer.

53:35.409 --> 53:36.872
Thank you.

53:56.831 --> 53:58.952
Mama wants to be left alone now.

53:59.125 --> 54:01.279
Run along and play outside.
It's such a lovely day.

54:17.652 --> 54:20.240
You always looked so nice,
so I wanted to be nice.

54:21.446 --> 54:26.333
I always worried that you
wouldn't like my appearance.

54:27.900 --> 54:32.220
I was so ugly. Lean and
angular with big cow's eyes,

54:32.389 --> 54:38.277
and big wide lips andno eyebrows.

54:38.445 --> 54:41.961
My arms were too thin and my feet too big.

54:42.135 --> 54:44.325
No, I thought I looked repulsive.

54:45.961 --> 54:50.408
Once you said: "You should have been a boy, "

54:50.585 --> 54:54.102
and laughed so I wouldn't be upset.

54:54.279 --> 55:00.630
I was, of course. Then one day
your suitcases would be downstairs

55:00.799 --> 55:04.687
and you'd be talking on the
phone in a foreign language.

55:05.755 --> 55:10.008
I used to pray that something
would stop you from going,

55:11.342 --> 55:12.999
butyou always went.

55:14.204 --> 55:18.150
You'd putyour arms around me and kiss me

55:18.329 --> 55:23.647
and look at me and smile.

55:23.817 --> 55:27.333
You smelled nice but strange.

55:27.507 --> 55:32.125
You yourself were a stranger, already
on your way. You didn't see me.

55:34.128 --> 55:40.343
Then you'd be gone. I used
to think, "Now I'll die,

55:40.616 --> 55:44.403
"it hurts so much. I'll never be happy again.

55:45.537 --> 55:49.689
"How can I bear such pain for two months?"

56:00.773 --> 56:05.389
And I'd cry In Papa's
lap. He'd sit quite still

56:05.563 --> 56:08.886
with his soft hand on my head.

56:09.056 --> 56:14.342
He'd go on and on sitting
there smoking his old pipe.

56:15.444 --> 56:21.091
Sometimes he'd say, "Let's go
to a movie this evening, "or

56:21.265 --> 56:23.453
"What about ice cream for dinner today? "

56:25.522 --> 56:28.912
But all I wanted was to die.

56:33.306 --> 56:36.822
So the days and weeks passed.

56:37.198 --> 56:39.681
We shared the loneliness quite well.

56:41.157 --> 56:43.242
We didn't have much to say

56:43.417 --> 56:46.241
but I never disturbed him.

56:47.974 --> 56:50.199
Sometimes he'd look
worried. I didn't know then

56:50.370 --> 56:55.020
that he was always short of
money. But whenever I'd come

56:55.194 --> 56:59.015
clumping along, his face would brighten,

56:59.185 --> 57:03.233
and he'd pat me with his pale little hand.

57:04.574 --> 57:10.256
Or else Uncle Otto would be sitting
on the sofa, drinking brandy.

57:10.561 --> 57:13.114
They'd mumble to each other.

57:13.554 --> 57:15.778
I wonder if they heard what they said.

57:17.048 --> 57:20.632
Or else Uncle Harry would be
there and they'd play chess,

57:22.137 --> 57:25.584
and then it'd be extra quiet.

57:26.993 --> 57:30.713
I could hear three different clocks ticking.

57:34.778 --> 57:37.000
A few days before you were due home

57:37.838 --> 57:40.594
I'd get a temperature from the excitement.

57:40.765 --> 57:43.692
I'd worry I might really get sick,

57:43.858 --> 57:45.978
because you were afraid of sick people.

57:48.184 --> 57:52.232
When you did come, I was so happy

57:52.409 --> 57:57.525
I couldn't say anything.
You'd get impatient and say,

57:57.698 --> 58:01.417
"Eva doesn't seem very pleased
to have her mother home again. "

58:02.754 --> 58:08.197
I'd blush red as a beet
and break out in a sweat.

58:08.641 --> 58:13.156
I couldn't say anything, I had no words.

58:14.630 --> 58:18.780
You had taken charge of
all the words in our home.

58:18.953 --> 58:22.672
- You're exaggerating.
- I must finish speaking.

58:22.844 --> 58:27.960
I know I'm tipsy but otherwise
I wouldn't have said what I have.

58:28.134 --> 58:32.114
When I don't dare say any
more because I'm ashamed

58:32.291 --> 58:37.508
you can explain and I'll
listen and understand

58:37.680 --> 58:39.370
just as I've always done.

58:44.233 --> 58:48.589
I loved you, Mama, it was
a matter of life and death.

58:48.757 --> 58:51.276
But I distrusted your words.

58:51.984 --> 58:54.705
They didn't match the
expression in your eyes.

58:56.043 --> 58:58.005
You have a beautiful
voice. When I was little,

58:58.170 --> 59:01.596
I could feel it all over my body.

59:01.764 --> 59:05.712
But I knew instinctively you
didn't mean what you said.

59:08.184 --> 59:10.270
I couldn't understand your words.

59:13.241 --> 59:16.960
The most horrible thing was,
you'd smile when you were mad.

59:17.664 --> 59:20.352
When you hated Papa you'd call him

59:20.525 --> 59:25.573
"my dearest." When you
were tired of me you'd say

59:25.746 --> 59:27.800
"darling little girl."

59:44.343 --> 59:45.670
How quiet.

59:48.035 --> 59:49.464
What am I to say?

59:51.062 --> 59:54.984
- Defend yourself.
- Is it worth while?

59:57.380 --> 01:00:01.101
- How do I know?
- You reproach me for going away

01:00:01.274 --> 01:00:02.964
and for staying at home.

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:08.358
I had a hell of a time those years.

01:00:10.355 --> 01:00:16.968
My back hurt, I couldn't practice.
Important engagements were cancelled.

01:00:17.141 --> 01:00:19.964
My life seemed meaningless.

01:00:20.135 --> 01:00:24.819
I had a guilty conscience about
always being away from you and Papa.

01:00:25.987 --> 01:00:31.035
You smile sarcastically. I'm
trying to speak truthfully.

01:00:31.310 --> 01:00:34.532
I'm merely telling you how I felt.

01:00:35.402 --> 01:00:38.556
We may as well have this out for
once then we won't refer to it again.

01:00:42.156 --> 01:00:43.812
Go on.

01:00:48.907 --> 01:00:52.855
I was in Hamburg, playing Beethoven's First.

01:00:53.034 --> 01:00:57.820
It's not too difficult, and
everything had gone well.

01:00:57.988 --> 01:01:01.279
After the concert I went out to
supper with Schmiess, the conductor.

01:01:01.449 --> 01:01:06.427
We always did. When we'd been
eating and drinking for a while

01:01:06.605 --> 01:01:10.654
and I was content and relaxed

01:01:10.831 --> 01:01:15.377
and my back wasn't aching, Schmiess said,

01:01:18.314 --> 01:01:20.934
"Why don't you stay at home with your husband

01:01:21.107 --> 01:01:24.998
"and child and lead a respectable life,

01:01:25.631 --> 01:01:29.147
"instead of laying yourself
open to constant humiliation?"

01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:37.399
I stared at him and laughed and said,

01:01:37.573 --> 01:01:42.021
" Did I play so badly?" " No," he said

01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:49.206
"but I can't help thinking
of August 18, 1934.

01:01:51.877 --> 01:01:56.233
"We played Beethoven's
First together in Linz.

01:01:57.165 --> 01:02:00.989
"You were twenty years
old, the hall was packed,

01:02:01.157 --> 01:02:04.312
"we played like gods, the
orchestra was inspired.

01:02:05.517 --> 01:02:09.372
"Afterwards, the audience
stood up and cheered

01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:11.163
"and the orchestra gave a fanfare."

01:02:16.392 --> 01:02:20.408
Then he said "You had a
simple red summer dress

01:02:20.585 --> 01:02:22.512
"and long hair to your waist."

01:02:25.507 --> 01:02:28.128
" How do you remember all that?" I asked.

01:02:29.531 --> 01:02:32.220
"I wrote it down in my score," he said.

01:02:33.292 --> 01:02:36.310
"I make a note of all my great experiences."

01:02:39.646 --> 01:02:42.299
When I got back to the
hotel, I couldn't sleep.

01:02:43.970 --> 01:02:46.453
At three in the morning I phoned Josef

01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:49.953
and told him I was going to stop touring,

01:02:51.022 --> 01:02:54.877
and stay at home with him and
you. We'd be a real family.

01:02:59.437 --> 01:03:02.023
Josef was awfully happy.

01:03:03.295 --> 01:03:05.415
We wept with emotion, both of us,

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:09.215
and talked for two hours.

01:03:09.981 --> 01:03:13.462
And that was that. That summer

01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:16.294
we were happy. Weren't we?

01:03:22.189 --> 01:03:24.842
You weren't happy? -No.

01:03:25.017 --> 01:03:27.138
You said things had never been so good.

01:03:31.402 --> 01:03:33.364
I said it to please you.

01:03:39.155 --> 01:03:45.200
That just goes to show. What did I do wrong?

01:03:45.374 --> 01:03:49.559
I was fourteen and you
directed the whole of your

01:03:49.731 --> 01:03:52.286
pent-up energy against me.

01:03:53.492 --> 01:03:56.044
You were damn well going to make up

01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:58.738
for your neglect.

01:03:58.914 --> 01:04:01.872
I tried to defend myself,
but I didn't' have a chance.

01:04:02.041 --> 01:04:07.519
You trotted out your thoughtfulness
and your worried voice.

01:04:07.695 --> 01:04:13.174
There wasn't one detail that
escaped your loving energy.

01:04:13.682 --> 01:04:17.368
I had a stoop. You got
to work with gymnastics.

01:04:17.542 --> 01:04:21.364
We did exercises together.

01:04:21.533 --> 01:04:25.081
You thought my hair was too long,

01:04:25.258 --> 01:04:28.615
so you had it cut short. It was hideous.

01:04:29.050 --> 01:04:31.805
Then you got the idea my teeth were crooked

01:04:31.978 --> 01:04:35.335
so I got braces. I looked grotesque.

01:04:35.504 --> 01:04:38.622
You said I couldn't go
around in pants any longer

01:04:38.797 --> 01:04:43.741
so you had dresses made
without asking what I thought.

01:04:43.919 --> 01:04:48.241
I didn't dare say no because
I didn't want to upset you.

01:04:49.874 --> 01:04:53.856
You brought along books for me

01:04:54.032 --> 01:04:57.923
which I didn't understand.
I read and read, then you

01:04:58.090 --> 01:05:02.106
and I had to discuss it. You'd
hold forth and my mind was a blank.

01:05:02.283 --> 01:05:05.502
I was scared you'd expose

01:05:05.674 --> 01:05:08.964
my stupidity.

01:05:09.135 --> 01:05:13.285
But one thing I did Understand: not a shred

01:05:13.458 --> 01:05:17.881
of the real me could be loved or accepted.

01:05:18.048 --> 01:05:22.802
You were obsessed and I grew more
and more afraid and annihilated.

01:05:22.972 --> 01:05:27.360
I said what you wanted me to
say and made your gestures.

01:05:27.529 --> 01:05:30.647
I didn't dare to be myself
even when I was alone

01:05:30.824 --> 01:05:35.439
because I hated what was my own.

01:05:36.977 --> 01:05:42.863
It was horrible, Mama! I still shake all over

01:05:43.031 --> 01:05:47.614
when I think of those years. It was horrible.

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:57.597
I didn't realize I hated you as I
was quite sure we loved each other.

01:05:58.032 --> 01:06:03.217
I couldn't hate you, so my
hatred turned into an insane fear.

01:06:03.389 --> 01:06:06.371
I had nightmares.

01:06:06.548 --> 01:06:08.838
I bit my nails.

01:06:10.007 --> 01:06:13.524
I pulled out tufts of hair.

01:06:13.699 --> 01:06:17.454
I tried to scream but could
only make stifled grunts.

01:06:17.625 --> 01:06:20.016
That frightened me even more

01:06:20.185 --> 01:06:23.737
as I thought I was going out of my mind.

01:06:38.814 --> 01:06:41.208
Then came Stefan. -And made you pregnant.

01:06:41.375 --> 01:06:46.322
I was 18. Stefan was grown-up.
We could have managed.

01:06:46.499 --> 01:06:52.079
- No!
- We wanted to have the child butyou spoiled everything.

01:06:52.253 --> 01:06:55.044
That's not true! I said to Papa

01:06:55.248 --> 01:07:01.099
we should wait and see. You
didn't realize Stefan was an idiot.

01:07:01.269 --> 01:07:05.918
Were you present at our discussions?

01:07:06.091 --> 01:07:11.638
Were you lurking under our bed?

01:07:11.814 --> 01:07:16.861
Have you ever given a damn about
any living soul except yourself?

01:07:17.035 --> 01:07:20.483
I didn't force you into an abortion.

01:07:20.661 --> 01:07:25.810
How could I defy you? I
was afraid and needed help.

01:07:25.984 --> 01:07:29.997
I tried to help you. I thought
abortion was the only way.

01:07:30.173 --> 01:07:35.754
I've thought so all along. All this hatred!

01:07:35.930 --> 01:07:39.252
Why have you never said anything?
- Because you never listen.

01:07:39.422 --> 01:07:44.900
You're a goddamn escapist.
You're emotionally crippled.

01:07:45.076 --> 01:07:48.433
In actual fact you detest me and Helena.

01:07:48.603 --> 01:07:51.359
You're shut up inside yourself

01:07:51.531 --> 01:07:54.456
and always stand in your own light.

01:07:54.790 --> 01:07:57.150
I loved you, but you thought I was disgusting

01:07:58.151 --> 01:08:03.400
and stupid and a failure.

01:08:03.570 --> 01:08:06.395
You managed to injure me for life,

01:08:06.564 --> 01:08:09.490
just as you are injured.

01:08:09.659 --> 01:08:12.948
All that was sensitive
and delicate, you attacked.

01:08:13.117 --> 01:08:16.475
All that was alive, you tried to smother.

01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:32.703
You talk of my hatred.

01:08:35.206 --> 01:08:37.529
Your hatred was no less.

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:44.384
Your hatred is no less.

01:08:46.783 --> 01:08:52.398
I was little and malleable and loving.

01:08:52.569 --> 01:08:56.187
You bound me because you wanted my love

01:08:56.362 --> 01:09:01.080
just as you want everyone else's love.

01:09:01.249 --> 01:09:03.678
I was utterly at your mercy.

01:09:06.009 --> 01:09:09.490
It was all done in the name of love.

01:09:09.933 --> 01:09:13.823
You kept saying you loved
me and Papa and Helena.

01:09:14.890 --> 01:09:18.473
And you were an expert at
love's intonations and gestures.

01:09:22.307 --> 01:09:24.734
People like you are a menace.

01:09:26.733 --> 01:09:29.884
You should be locked away
and rendered harmless.

01:09:47.953 --> 01:09:49.578
A mother and a daughter.

01:09:56.170 --> 01:10:00.560
What a terrible combination

01:10:01.361 --> 01:10:06.477
of feelings and confusion and destruction.

01:10:08.447 --> 01:10:13.199
Everything is possible and is done
in the name of love and solicitude.

01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:20.784
The mother's injuries are to
be handed down to the daughter.

01:10:22.882 --> 01:10:26.238
The mother's failures are to
be paid for by the daughter.

01:10:28.734 --> 01:10:32.921
The mother's unhappiness is to
be the daughter's unhappiness.

01:10:34.825 --> 01:10:38.648
It's as if the umbilical
cord had never been cut.

01:10:42.009 --> 01:10:46.399
Is it so?

01:10:49.526 --> 01:10:52.488
Is the daughter's misfortune
the mother's triumph?

01:11:00.605 --> 01:11:06.115
Is my grief your secret pleasure?

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:03.134
My back's aching.

01:12:05.104 --> 01:12:07.088
Do you mind If I lie on the floor,

01:12:08.961 --> 01:12:10.719
it's the only thing that helps.

01:12:14.783 --> 01:12:17.175
I remember very little of my childhood.

01:12:18.643 --> 01:12:22.396
I can't recall my parents
ever having touched me,

01:12:22.967 --> 01:12:26.357
either with caresses or punishments.

01:12:27.757 --> 01:12:32.178
I was quite ignorant of
everything to do with love:

01:12:32.347 --> 01:12:37.267
tenderness, contact, intimacy, warmth.

01:12:40.864 --> 01:12:46.183
Only through music did I have
a chance to show my feelings.

01:12:49.443 --> 01:12:51.837
Sometimes, when I lie awake at night

01:12:53.636 --> 01:12:56.595
I wonder whether I've lived at all.

01:12:58.725 --> 01:13:01.651
Is it the same for everybody?

01:13:02.551 --> 01:13:07.269
Or do some people have a greater
talent for living than others.

01:13:07.906 --> 01:13:11.797
Or do some people never live

01:13:13.495 --> 01:13:15.480
but just exist?

01:13:19.315 --> 01:13:25.666
Then I'm seized by fear.

01:13:26.634 --> 01:13:29.424
I'm seized by fear and see
a horrible picture of myself.

01:13:30.659 --> 01:13:32.917
I have never grown up.

01:13:33.654 --> 01:13:36.580
My face and my body have aged.

01:13:39.108 --> 01:13:41.694
I acquire memories and experiences,

01:13:42.934 --> 01:13:47.686
but inside all that I haven't even been born.

01:13:51.184 --> 01:13:53.474
I can't remember any faces

01:13:55.307 --> 01:13:57.065
not even my own.

01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:03.416
Sometimes, I try to recall my mother's face

01:14:04.686 --> 01:14:11.163
but I can't see her. I know she
was big and dark and had blue eyes,

01:14:11.541 --> 01:14:15.521
a large nose and full lips.

01:14:16.597 --> 01:14:19.682
But I can't fit the various bits together.

01:14:23.683 --> 01:14:26.234
I can't see her. In the same way,

01:14:26.411 --> 01:14:30.732
I can't see your face or
Helena's or Leonardo's.

01:14:31.102 --> 01:14:33.924
I remember giving birth
To you and your sister but

01:14:34.093 --> 01:14:40.207
all I know of the
deliveries is that they hurt.

01:14:42.076 --> 01:14:45.526
But the pain? What was that like?

01:14:47.832 --> 01:14:49.757
I don't remember.

01:14:53.587 --> 01:14:55.412
Leonardo once said that...

01:14:57.078 --> 01:15:00.197
how did he put it now...

01:15:00.836 --> 01:15:05.454
"A sense of reality is a matter of talent.

01:15:06.757 --> 01:15:12.804
" Most people lack that talent
and maybe it's just as well."

01:15:15.142 --> 01:15:19.827
Do you know what he meant? -Yes, I do.

01:15:22.959 --> 01:15:26.612
How very strange. -Strange?

01:15:28.216 --> 01:15:32.798
I've always been afraid of
you. -I can't understand that.

01:15:33.039 --> 01:15:36.827
I think I wanted you to take care of me.

01:15:37.993 --> 01:15:41.610
To put your arms around me and comfort me.

01:15:42.684 --> 01:15:44.271
I was a child.

01:15:48.339 --> 01:15:50.959
Does that matter? -No.

01:15:51.732 --> 01:15:53.786
I saw you loved me

01:15:55.125 --> 01:15:57.178
and I wanted to love you, but

01:15:58.152 --> 01:16:02.200
I was afraid of your demands.

01:16:04.273 --> 01:16:08.255
- I didn't have any.
- I thought you did.

01:16:10.627 --> 01:16:12.713
I didn't want to be your mother.

01:16:14.353 --> 01:16:17.609
I wanted you to know I was
as helpless as you were.

01:16:19.541 --> 01:16:21.094
Is that really true?

01:16:40.530 --> 01:16:43.957
- What are you thinking about?
- Leonardo and Helena.

01:16:45.654 --> 01:16:46.912
I don't understand.

01:16:48.348 --> 01:16:50.172
Why, they hardly knew each other.

01:16:52.173 --> 01:16:57.525
We were together on Bornholm one Easter.
- You left after 3 days.

01:16:57.694 --> 01:17:00.916
I was to play Bartok's First in Geneva.

01:17:01.087 --> 01:17:05.975
I wanted to go through the concerto
with the conductor in peace an quiet.

01:17:07.141 --> 01:17:10.397
So it's possible I did leave earlier.

01:17:10.669 --> 01:17:15.422
The weather was hideous. Leonardo
was in a bad mood. So were you.

01:17:18.053 --> 01:17:21.806
Why make me remember it all?

01:17:22.012 --> 01:17:23.635
I'll tell you.

01:17:25.239 --> 01:17:29.424
You arrived on Thursday.
That evening we laughed

01:17:29.597 --> 01:17:32.612
and sang and drank wine and played

01:17:32.789 --> 01:17:35.116
some old game we found.

01:17:35.916 --> 01:17:38.537
Helena wasn't so ill then. She was

01:17:38.710 --> 01:17:40.796
happy all evening.

01:17:41.838 --> 01:17:43.991
Leonardo was happy because she was.

01:17:44.164 --> 01:17:47.782
He talked and joked with her.

01:17:49.353 --> 01:17:52.074
She fell head over heels in love.

01:17:52.846 --> 01:17:55.499
They sat together until late at night.

01:17:56.939 --> 01:18:02.622
Next day Helena told me he had kissed her.

01:18:11.676 --> 01:18:13.638
In the evening we had guests.

01:18:14.935 --> 01:18:20.151
Leonardo drank too much and
played all the Bach solo suites.

01:18:21.787 --> 01:18:24.805
He was quite unlike himself,

01:18:24.982 --> 01:18:27.703
heavy and gentle and as if enlarged.

01:18:29.437 --> 01:18:33.022
He played badly but beautifully.

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:38.147
Helena sat there in the dusk, beaming.

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:40.213
I've never seen anything like it.

01:19:35.101 --> 01:19:39.217
You and I went for a
walk. You chattered away.

01:19:39.392 --> 01:19:43.249
I didn't really listen. I
was thinking of those two.

01:19:46.212 --> 01:19:51.100
When we got home, they were
sitting as we'd left them.

01:19:51.268 --> 01:19:57.813
You went off to bed and I
had to help Leonardo upstairs.

01:19:59.285 --> 01:20:02.007
Outside the door of the bedroom

01:20:02.179 --> 01:20:06.160
he stopped, looked at me and said,

01:20:08.334 --> 01:20:11.850
"Can you imagine? There's a butterfly

01:20:12.024 --> 01:20:15.248
"fluttering against the window."

01:20:17.114 --> 01:20:22.263
When I went back to Helena, she was sitting

01:20:22.438 --> 01:20:26.090
bolt upright, quite relaxed and calm.

01:20:27.259 --> 01:20:32.080
There wasn't a trace of her illness.

01:20:36.308 --> 01:20:38.634
I'll never forget her face, Mama.

01:20:43.326 --> 01:20:45.787
I'll never forget her face.

01:20:50.376 --> 01:20:52.668
Next morning you left for Geneva,

01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:57.392
four days earlier than we had agreed.

01:20:58.662 --> 01:21:02.212
You said casually on
Leaving," I've asked Leonardo

01:21:02.388 --> 01:21:06.537
"to stay, as I see it's doing Helena good."

01:21:06.711 --> 01:21:08.675
And you smiled.

01:21:10.804 --> 01:21:14.785
Leonardo abruptly became
restless and unhappy.

01:21:22.412 --> 01:21:27.267
On Easter Day he went for a long
walk in the rain. When he came back,

01:21:27.435 --> 01:21:33.684
he told Helena he was leaving.
He said they'd meet again.

01:21:34.752 --> 01:21:39.676
Then he called Geneva and
talked To you for an hour.

01:21:40.972 --> 01:21:44.897
That evening he left on the last plane.

01:21:58.735 --> 01:22:01.527
During the night I was
woken by Helena crying.

01:22:03.163 --> 01:22:06.314
She complained of pain
in her hip and right leg.

01:22:08.151 --> 01:22:11.045
She didn't think she could
stand it until morning.

01:22:12.710 --> 01:22:15.792
At 5 o'clock I had to
phone for the ambulance.

01:22:20.157 --> 01:22:24.911
- So Lena's illness was my fault?
- Yes, I think so.

01:22:29.073 --> 01:22:32.726
- You mean that her illness...
- Yes.

01:22:36.489 --> 01:22:41.707
- You don't seriously mean...
- When Lena was a year old you deserted her.

01:22:43.543 --> 01:22:45.968
Then you kept deserting
her and me all the time.

01:22:48.098 --> 01:22:51.820
When Lena got seriously
ill, you sent her to a home.

01:22:52.923 --> 01:22:55.885
- It can't be true...
- What can't be true?

01:22:58.049 --> 01:23:00.598
Have you any proof to the contrary?

01:23:03.669 --> 01:23:08.524
Look at me, Mama. Look at Helena.

01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:13.677
There are no excuses.

01:23:15.711 --> 01:23:20.496
There is only one truth and one lie.

01:23:22.031 --> 01:23:24.390
There can be no forgiveness.

01:23:25.122 --> 01:23:31.340
- You can't blame me entirely.
- You expect an exception for you.

01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:36.594
You've set up a sort of
discount system with life

01:23:39.328 --> 01:23:44.410
but one day you'll see that
your agreement is one-sided.

01:23:46.313 --> 01:23:49.670
You'll see you're harboring a
guilt,just like everyone else.

01:23:51.602 --> 01:23:53.563
What guilt?

01:23:59.054 --> 01:24:00.742
Eva darling.

01:24:02.744 --> 01:24:05.435
Won't you forgive me for
all the wrong I've done?

01:24:07.504 --> 01:24:09.430
I'll try to mend my ways.

01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:15.046
You've got to teach me,
we'll talk to each other.

01:24:17.782 --> 01:24:21.104
But help me. I can't go on.

01:24:22.338 --> 01:24:24.459
Your hatred is so terrible.

01:24:26.429 --> 01:24:32.145
I haven't realized. I've
been selfish and childish.

01:24:36.277 --> 01:24:37.967
Can't you put your arms around me?

01:24:40.100 --> 01:24:42.063
Touch me, at least!

01:24:45.025 --> 01:24:46.782
Help me!

01:24:49.946 --> 01:24:52.705
Mama!

01:24:55.503 --> 01:24:56.491
Come!

01:24:57.966 --> 01:24:59.225
Help me!

01:25:00.861 --> 01:25:02.447
Mama!

01:25:05.649 --> 01:25:06.637
Come!

01:25:51.986 --> 01:25:56.432
Poor little Mama, rushing off like that.

01:25:57.742 --> 01:26:02.324
She looked so frightened and
suddenly so old and tired.

01:26:03.662 --> 01:26:08.640
Her face had shrunk and her
nose was red from crying.

01:26:11.578 --> 01:26:13.540
Now I'll never see her again.

01:26:30.206 --> 01:26:33.655
It'll be dark soon, and it's getting cold.

01:26:35.327 --> 01:26:38.346
I've got to get home and make
dinner for Viktor and Helena.

01:26:41.450 --> 01:26:43.310
I can't die now.

01:26:45.177 --> 01:26:47.569
I'm afraid to commit suicide,

01:26:49.566 --> 01:26:52.322
and one day maybe God will want to use me.

01:26:53.892 --> 01:26:56.046
Then he'll set me free from my prison.

01:27:13.583 --> 01:27:17.667
I feel so shut out, I'm always homesick.

01:27:17.842 --> 01:27:19.530
But when I get home

01:27:20.835 --> 01:27:23.886
I find it's something else I'm longing for.

01:27:27.022 --> 01:27:28.609
Are you stroking my cheek?

01:27:30.747 --> 01:27:32.573
Are you whispering in my ear?

01:27:34.572 --> 01:27:35.966
Are you with me now?

01:27:38.664 --> 01:27:41.285
We'll never leave each other.

01:28:16.519 --> 01:28:18.308
There's a light on in Helena's room.

01:28:20.209 --> 01:28:22.170
Viktor's there, talking to her.

01:28:23.670 --> 01:28:26.561
That's good. Kind of him.

01:28:28.694 --> 01:28:30.982
He's telling her Mama has left.

01:28:35.645 --> 01:28:37.606
Your mother sent her love.

01:28:38.272 --> 01:28:42.199
She was sad and worried. She'd been crying.

01:28:55.304 --> 01:28:58.595
Eva has gone for a walk.

01:28:59.198 --> 01:29:01.919
She was looking forward so
much to seeing her mother.

01:29:03.255 --> 01:29:05.479
She hoped for too much.

01:29:06.383 --> 01:29:09.172
I hadn't the heart to warn her.

01:29:19.189 --> 01:29:22.115
I can't understand what you're saying.

01:29:25.276 --> 01:29:26.898
You say you want to...?

01:29:28.801 --> 01:29:32.192
Try to speak calmly,

01:29:32.361 --> 01:29:35.876
otherwise I can't understand.

01:29:41.577 --> 01:29:43.504
Eva! Come quickly!

01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:05.518
Sometimes I stand here looking at my wife

01:30:05.692 --> 01:30:07.881
without her knowing.

01:30:10.049 --> 01:30:11.773
She's in such distress.

01:30:12.745 --> 01:30:16.135
Since Charlotte left so suddenly

01:30:16.304 --> 01:30:18.356
she has been terribly upset.

01:30:20.227 --> 01:30:22.052
She has not been able to sleep.

01:30:23.090 --> 01:30:25.879
She says she drove her mother away

01:30:26.248 --> 01:30:28.403
and can never forgive herself.

01:30:28.809 --> 01:30:32.928
- Are you going out?
- Just down to the post office.

01:30:33.134 --> 01:30:35.959
Could you please mail this letter for me?

01:30:36.130 --> 01:30:39.885
Sure. It's to Charlotte?

01:30:40.055 --> 01:30:43.673
Read it if you like. I'm going up to Helena.

01:30:49.601 --> 01:30:53.650
" Dear Mama! I realize that I wronged you.

01:30:54.823 --> 01:30:57.942
"I met you with demands instead of affection.

01:30:58.750 --> 01:31:02.505
"I tormented you with an old
hatred that's no longer real.

01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:06.465
"I want to ask your forgiveness."

01:31:06.899 --> 01:31:10.256
I don't know if this letter will reach you.

01:31:10.424 --> 01:31:12.611
I don't even know if you will read it.

01:31:14.483 --> 01:31:16.569
Maybe everything is already too late.

01:31:18.608 --> 01:31:23.459
But I hope all the same that my
discovery will not be in vain.

01:31:24.694 --> 01:31:27.120
There is a kind of mercy after all.

01:31:27.887 --> 01:31:32.936
I mean the enormous opportunity of
getting to take care of each other,

01:31:34.607 --> 01:31:36.502
to help each other,

01:31:38.033 --> 01:31:39.826
to show affection.

01:31:42.724 --> 01:31:46.012
I will never let you
vanish out of my life again.

01:31:47.813 --> 01:31:49.742
I'm going to persist.

01:31:50.808 --> 01:31:54.631
I won't give up, even if it is too late.

01:31:55.864 --> 01:31:58.086
I don't think it is too late.

01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:03.177
It must not be too late.
