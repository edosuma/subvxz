<i>New York City, the world capital
of culture and industry.</i>

00:23.200 --> 00:25.698
<i>Here, among the
towering skyscrapers,</i>

00:25.699 --> 00:30.199
<i>civilization is guided by men of
progress and the wonders of technology.</i>

00:30.200 --> 00:34.199
<i>But for all this industrial
advancement, there is a price to pay.</i>

00:34.200 --> 00:39.200
<i>Pollution. The unavoidable
byproduct of today's society.</i>

00:41.700 --> 00:45.199
<i>Every year, millions of
gallons of poisonous wastes,</i>

00:45.200 --> 00:48.699
<i>garbage, and radioactive chemicals
are disposed of in nearby towns</i>

00:48.700 --> 00:53.700
<i>such as Tromaville, the toxic waste
dumping capital of the world.</i>

00:54.200 --> 00:56.899
<i>Our story takes place at
the Tromaville Health Club</i>

00:56.900 --> 00:59.699
<i>where a young man named
Melvin Furd works.</i>

00:59.700 --> 01:02.199
<i>Melvin's entire life, in fact</i>

01:02.200 --> 01:07.200
<i>entire being was changed
by toxic chemical waste.</i>

02:28.700 --> 02:31.699
Would you take a look
at that fucking guy?

02:31.700 --> 02:35.700
Dumb mop boy can't even mop right.

02:36.700 --> 02:38.199
He's so stupid!

02:38.200 --> 02:41.699
He's always got that
shit-eating grin on his face.

02:41.700 --> 02:43.700
What's he so happy about?

02:44.700 --> 02:46.200
I hate that mop boy.

02:47.700 --> 02:51.700
I think that creep
is coming over here.

02:54.200 --> 02:58.199
Julie, you smell something?

02:58.200 --> 03:03.200
Ew! P-U! What's that stink?

03:05.700 --> 03:10.200
Gee, that's funny.
I don't smell nothing.

03:12.200 --> 03:14.699
Melvin, clean up the toilet,
it stinks over here!

03:14.700 --> 03:18.700
OK. I'll be right there!

03:22.200 --> 03:24.199
Look what you did,
you fucking asshole!

03:24.200 --> 03:26.199
Yeah, you fucking asshole!

03:26.200 --> 03:28.699
- Hey, what are you, retarded?
- Huh? Retarded?

03:28.700 --> 03:29.699
I'm sorry!

03:29.700 --> 03:31.199
Sorry, huh?

03:31.200 --> 03:32.698
You want me to go and
get a fucking disease!

03:32.699 --> 03:35.198
Yeah, you want her to go
and get a fucking disease?

03:35.199 --> 03:36.199
I didn't mean it!

03:36.200 --> 03:37.200
Aw, I didn't mean it.

03:38.700 --> 03:44.200
Next time you fuck with me, I'm gonna take
this mop and shove it down your throat.

03:45.700 --> 03:47.199
He is stressing me, Julie!

03:47.200 --> 03:48.699
He is stressing me!

03:48.700 --> 03:49.699
Oh, Bozo...

03:49.700 --> 03:54.200
I can't take it. I cannot take it Julie.
He is screwing up my karma!

03:56.700 --> 03:59.699
See what you did, you idiot?
See what you did!?

03:59.700 --> 04:02.199
You've stressed Bozo!

04:02.200 --> 04:06.199
I'm sorry, Julie. I didn't mean to do it.
He was sitting there and I...

04:06.200 --> 04:10.300
Ah! How dare you talk
to me, you twerp!

04:24.700 --> 04:27.700
Keep it up, Bozo. Keep it up.

04:27.900 --> 04:29.699
But remember,

04:29.700 --> 04:32.700
there is only one muscle
you gotta worry about.

04:34.700 --> 04:39.199
Hey, you know. I think you ought
to work a little bit on your gut.

04:39.200 --> 04:41.698
You're getting a little
bit flabby there.

04:41.699 --> 04:43.699
Where!? What are you talking about?

04:43.700 --> 04:47.200
I don't got no fat! There's no
fat here. I don't got no f...

04:47.700 --> 04:50.700
Fat! Fat!

05:06.200 --> 05:08.699
Slug, are you sure
no one will come in?

05:08.700 --> 05:10.699
I paid Tony 15 bucks.

05:10.700 --> 05:14.700
He said the place is ours
until tomorrow morning.

05:15.700 --> 05:18.699
Relax. You want a drink?

05:18.700 --> 05:21.000
- Yeah.
- Alright.

05:26.900 --> 05:31.199
Slug, can I come again next
time you and Bozo go driving?

05:31.200 --> 05:34.099
If you want to, bad enough.

05:34.100 --> 05:36.699
I love it when we go real fast.

05:36.700 --> 05:38.199
And they never know what hit 'em.

05:38.200 --> 05:41.299
They never believe we're
going to run 'em down.

05:41.300 --> 05:44.299
We keep getting closer and closer.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.599
And faster and faster.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.899
They're just standing
there and yeah.

05:48.900 --> 05:50.099
We hit them!

05:50.100 --> 05:52.099
I love the sound of breaking bones!

05:52.100 --> 05:55.199
The car driving over them,
dragging their bodies.

05:55.200 --> 05:57.699
All that beautiful blood!

05:57.700 --> 05:59.699
Slug!

05:59.700 --> 06:02.200
I want you, now.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.700
Oh, Slug!

06:10.400 --> 06:12.400
Oh, Slug!

06:30.400 --> 06:33.400
Give it to me! Give it to me!
More! More!

06:45.700 --> 06:48.400
Get out of here, you pervert!

06:48.900 --> 06:51.400
Or I'll kill ya!

07:05.200 --> 07:08.199
Julie. Julie, the points.
The rules, what are they?

07:08.200 --> 07:10.699
Let me see if I can
remember the whole list.

07:10.700 --> 07:16.699
Now, jews, whops,
niggers and chinks,

07:16.700 --> 07:19.699
they're all worth
twenty-five points.

07:19.700 --> 07:22.699
But Puerto Ricans, they're
worth thirty points.

07:22.700 --> 07:27.700
Now kids under twelve they're
worth double points.

07:27.900 --> 07:29.399
Skippy, don't forget your helmet.

07:29.400 --> 07:31.900
OK, sis.

07:32.700 --> 07:36.200
And be careful out there.

07:37.700 --> 07:42.200
Julie, does it count
if I graze them?

07:42.900 --> 07:49.900
You got to destroy them!
Bozo, I want them dead.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.399
Now we're gonna get 'em.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.112
Come on. Come on! Come on!

07:56.138 --> 07:59.425
Where the fuck is everybody?
Where the fuck is everybody?

08:05.400 --> 08:08.399
How much is a kid on a bicycle?

08:08.400 --> 08:09.620
Where?

08:10.700 --> 08:14.599
Twenty-eight points if you get
both the kid and the bike?

08:14.600 --> 08:17.600
Let's take a closer look.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.699
Oh, he a cute little boy, isn't he?

08:22.700 --> 08:26.700
Out pretty late, aren't you, honey?

08:29.700 --> 08:31.199
The coast is clear, Bozo.

08:31.200 --> 08:33.200
We got him!

08:40.700 --> 08:43.200
We're gonna kill him!
We're gonna get him!

09:04.400 --> 09:06.399
Now you get full points!

09:06.400 --> 09:10.400
No way! The kid's still moving!

09:11.700 --> 09:14.699
We're not finished yet!

09:14.700 --> 09:17.199
He's still moving, no way
you get full points.

09:17.200 --> 09:21.200
No way, huh? No way?
I'll fucking show you no way.

09:35.700 --> 09:38.200
Give me that! Gibe me that!

09:42.700 --> 09:44.699
Full points, my man!

09:44.700 --> 09:48.700
Look at him! Wow, oh my God!

09:55.500 --> 09:59.499
These are gonna be the best
shots we've ever taken.

09:59.500 --> 10:01.500
Yeah, this is fun!

10:02.500 --> 10:04.999
These are great!

10:05.000 --> 10:08.500
Show me your pretty pictures!

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
That was good! That was good!

10:17.500 --> 10:20.498
I want to do it again!
I want to do it again!

10:20.499 --> 10:24.000
- Yeah, let's do it again!
- Yeah, let's go for it again!

10:24.001 --> 10:26.999
No, no I can't.
I've got to go home.

10:27.000 --> 10:27.999
What?

10:28.000 --> 10:30.799
Well, I got to get up
early in the morning.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.799
Got to go to church.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.350
Oh!

10:39.048 --> 10:41.573
And up! Up! Up! Up!

10:41.574 --> 10:44.599
Now kick! Out! Out! Out!

10:44.600 --> 10:47.199
Now arms up! Stop. Stop.

10:47.200 --> 10:50.699
That's really pitiful.
Just stop. Just stop a second.

10:50.700 --> 10:52.699
Look how many times do
I have to tell you people?

10:52.700 --> 10:55.699
Do exactly what I do.

10:55.700 --> 10:58.499
If I kick my right foot,
you kick your right foot.

10:58.500 --> 11:01.299
If I kick my left foot,
you kick your left foot.

11:01.300 --> 11:04.399
Okay? Whatever I do, you
do exactly the same thing.

11:04.400 --> 11:08.499
Okay? Now how about we start again?
You're gonna do exactly what I'm doing.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.650
Okay guys, you know
what I'm talking about?

11:10.651 --> 11:15.400
Let's go, let's do it this time. Okay! Let's
get the music! 5, 6, 7, and hey, hey...

11:37.000 --> 11:40.599
Watch what I'm doing here.
Watch how I hit this ball.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.624
Are you watching me!?
Are you watching me!?

11:42.625 --> 11:45.399
I'm going to kill it! I'm going
to kill it! I'm going to kill it!

11:45.400 --> 11:50.400
Aah! I'm gonna kick
that freak's mouth in!

11:51.200 --> 11:55.499
Bozo, it's okay. It's okay.
Hey, guys, come here.

11:55.500 --> 11:59.354
Have I got a plan to fix
that mop boys wagon.

11:59.355 --> 12:01.050
Great! What is it?

12:01.541 --> 12:03.041
Well...

12:07.447 --> 12:08.404
Hi, Melvin.

12:08.405 --> 12:10.499
Whoa!

12:10.500 --> 12:13.962
Melvin. Melvin, it's okay.
It's okay.

12:13.963 --> 12:20.499
Hey, I just came to apologize. Yes,
I didn't mean to be so nasty yesterday.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.999
Oh, that's okay, Julie.
I didn't really mind.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.499
In fact, I was hoping
you could help me,

12:25.500 --> 12:27.724
with a little problem.
I've been having.

12:27.725 --> 12:29.999
- Who, me?
- Yes but...

12:30.000 --> 12:33.500
I can't talk about here with
all these people around.

12:33.507 --> 12:36.271
Hey, I got a great idea.

12:36.272 --> 12:38.500
Why don't you meet me in
the girls locker room?

12:38.811 --> 12:40.631
Girls' locker room?

12:40.632 --> 12:44.991
Yes. Then we can discuss it alone.

12:44.992 --> 12:47.733
Oh, oh!

12:49.749 --> 12:51.272
Okay.

12:51.273 --> 12:53.499
Great! Let's say 7 o'clock.

12:53.500 --> 12:56.448
Okay. That'll be good for me, too,
'cause I gotta to clean the toilets

12:56.449 --> 12:59.500
in there around that time anyway.

12:59.645 --> 13:01.499
Good. It's a date. See you then.

13:01.500 --> 13:04.000
Okay.

13:06.500 --> 13:13.990
490... 491... 492...

13:15.391 --> 13:23.499
493... 494... 495...

13:23.500 --> 13:28.226
Hi, guys. Well, Melvin fell
for it. Hook line and sinker.

13:28.227 --> 13:29.400
Great!

13:36.000 --> 13:38.499
We've been driving
for two whole hours.

13:38.500 --> 13:41.120
Let's pull this rig
over and take a break.

13:41.121 --> 13:42.526
Hey, the boss'll have our asses.

13:42.527 --> 13:44.752
You know he don't want us
to stop in habitated areas

13:44.753 --> 13:47.499
with this radioactive chemical
waste we got on the back.

13:47.500 --> 13:51.226
It's dangerous. It's like that
cancerogenic stuff, you know.

13:51.227 --> 13:55.385
Hey Joey, you remember that dope
we were snorting last week?

13:55.386 --> 13:59.744
- Do I?
- Well, buddy boy. Check this out.

13:59.745 --> 14:01.499
Holy shit! Why didn't you say so.

14:01.500 --> 14:04.000
Let's pull it over!

14:13.023 --> 14:14.421
Julie.

14:14.547 --> 14:17.919
- Hi, Melvin.
- Hi, Julie.

14:17.920 --> 14:20.441
Come in, don't be shy.

14:21.500 --> 14:24.878
So, what was it that you
wanted me to help you with?

14:24.879 --> 14:26.999
- Well, it's about Bozo.
- Bozo?

14:27.000 --> 14:28.999
Yeah, you see, I'm so sick
of the way he goes around

14:29.000 --> 14:31.499
pushing people around all the time.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.499
He's so immature.

14:33.500 --> 14:37.499
In fact, I don't like to
go out with him anymore.

14:37.500 --> 14:40.999
But I don't know quite
how to tell him.

14:41.000 --> 14:45.499
In fact, Melvin,
I think you're handsome,

14:45.500 --> 14:50.372
and sensitive and kind.

14:50.373 --> 14:55.245
Oh, Melvin, I find
you irresistible.

14:55.771 --> 14:57.500
- Me?
- Yes.

14:57.721 --> 15:00.155
Melvin, I want to do it with you.

15:00.156 --> 15:00.893
Do it?

15:00.894 --> 15:01.810
Do it!

15:01.811 --> 15:02.697
Do what?

15:02.698 --> 15:03.999
Do it, Melvin, do it!

15:04.000 --> 15:07.621
Do it? Okay.

15:07.622 --> 15:10.634
Wait a minute. Have I got
a great idea, Melvin.

15:10.635 --> 15:11.641
What is it?

15:11.642 --> 15:13.368
We'll go down by the pool.

15:13.369 --> 15:16.307
And afterward we can
take a cool dip.

15:16.346 --> 15:17.959
Alright.

15:17.960 --> 15:21.241
There's one other
little thing, Melvin.

15:21.452 --> 15:23.500
You're not wearing pink.

15:23.686 --> 15:27.000
- Pink?
- It's my favorite color.

15:27.161 --> 15:29.999
I have my pink on.

15:30.000 --> 15:34.499
So, I brought this for you.

15:34.500 --> 15:39.971
- But this is sissy stuff.
- Oh, no, Melvin. Pink makes me so hot.

15:39.972 --> 15:42.500
- It does.
- Yes.

15:42.534 --> 15:47.342
If you put on your pink,
I'll take off my pink.

15:52.335 --> 15:57.000
- I love pink!
- Hurry up, I'll be waiting for you.

15:58.176 --> 16:00.832
- And bring your mop.
- I will!

16:21.500 --> 16:26.499
- Julie?
- Here I am, Melvin.

16:26.500 --> 16:30.233
It's so dark in here, where
are you? I can't see you

16:30.234 --> 16:34.500
I'm right here, Melvin. Come here.

16:34.718 --> 16:37.500
My lips are waiting
for you, Melvin.

16:37.742 --> 16:40.285
Whoa, put your arms around me.

16:40.286 --> 16:44.349
Oh, Julie! Julie!
Oh, Julie! I'm here!

16:44.350 --> 16:47.000
Okay! Turn on the light!

16:49.092 --> 16:50.927
You're so soft, Julie.

16:50.928 --> 16:52.319
Baaa.

16:52.320 --> 16:53.820
Ooh!

18:22.334 --> 18:24.646
Ooh, he doesn't look
very good to me.

18:28.498 --> 18:31.272
He's faking it, Julie!
He's faking it.

18:34.952 --> 18:36.311
I think he's in trouble.

18:36.312 --> 18:39.812
Julie, this guy, if he can't
take a joke, he stinks.

18:42.500 --> 18:45.854
Get back! Get back!
Step off! Get back!

18:45.855 --> 18:47.339
Get out of here!

18:47.381 --> 18:49.058
Easy, guy.

19:05.273 --> 19:08.197
Melvin's on fire! Melvin's on fire!

19:24.281 --> 19:27.521
Melvin, dear, are you alright?

19:28.882 --> 19:31.130
Is anything the matter?

19:36.000 --> 19:39.811
God, my arms! Ow! Ow!

19:41.178 --> 19:42.899
Oh my feet!

19:43.500 --> 19:46.892
Oh my God!

20:23.773 --> 20:25.894
Are you okay?

20:40.351 --> 20:42.784
Melvin, dear, are you alright?

21:21.045 --> 21:27.545
My little Melvin! He must
have finally reached puberty.

21:43.523 --> 21:46.030
One. Two.

21:46.031 --> 21:48.998
Three. Four. Five.

21:48.999 --> 21:51.748
When we lay this wad
on, old Clancy.

21:51.749 --> 21:54.939
The boss is going to
have him by the balls.

21:55.923 --> 21:58.391
I don't think old Clancy
will take the money.

21:58.392 --> 22:01.094
Everyone says he's an honest cop.

22:01.095 --> 22:05.499
If he don't take the dough,
I'm gonna give him a blow.

22:05.500 --> 22:06.233
Ha ha!

22:06.234 --> 22:08.976
A pair of knuckles.

22:13.528 --> 22:19.355
Well, if it ain't, Cigar Face. What
are you and your friends up to?

22:19.356 --> 22:22.104
We brought you a little
present from the boss.

22:22.105 --> 22:23.387
Here.

22:26.686 --> 22:29.908
No way. You're wasting your time.

22:29.909 --> 22:32.423
No. That's where you're wrong.

22:32.424 --> 22:34.500
You're wasting our time.

22:36.078 --> 22:38.578
Now we're going to waste you!

22:39.281 --> 22:40.781
Ow!

22:42.164 --> 22:47.512
Now you're going to find out
why they call me Cigar Face.

22:58.507 --> 23:00.231
Get him Nipples, yeah!

23:08.867 --> 23:10.620
Come on, now. Come on!

23:20.273 --> 23:22.439
What the matter, Clancy?

23:25.656 --> 23:27.408
Get him!

23:37.523 --> 23:42.485
Honest cops are all alike!
A bunch of fuckin' fagots!

23:42.958 --> 23:46.412
What do you say, shall I
blow his nose off or what?

23:46.413 --> 23:48.944
Boss says if he doesn't
want to cooperate,

23:48.945 --> 23:51.967
we should make love to him.

23:52.366 --> 23:56.248
Well, whatever the boss says, goes.

23:56.780 --> 24:00.163
No... No, no, please!
Please, oh God, please.

24:00.164 --> 24:03.639
No, no. No, please. Come on.
I've got a family!

24:03.640 --> 24:06.303
Say your prayers, copper!

24:14.437 --> 24:15.954
Holy shit!

24:40.037 --> 24:44.996
Could that be the, O'Shanahee
boy back from school.

24:46.241 --> 24:47.793
No! No!

26:19.992 --> 26:23.342
I'll get you for this,
you monster faggot!

26:37.218 --> 26:39.439
Don't worry. Don't
worry, I won't hurt you.

26:39.440 --> 26:41.338
I don't know what came over me.

26:42.538 --> 26:45.061
I just couldn't control myself.

26:45.062 --> 26:47.978
I've never done anything
like this before.

26:58.796 --> 27:00.064
Bye.

27:01.546 --> 27:02.939
Quiet!

27:03.529 --> 27:06.741
Quiet!

27:06.742 --> 27:14.190
Now, you will raise your hand and you
will ask one question at a time.

27:14.219 --> 27:15.920
Exactly where did it happen?

27:15.921 --> 27:18.317
It happened in Shinbone Alley.

27:18.318 --> 27:20.326
These three guys were
going to kill me, see.

27:20.327 --> 27:24.373
And then of nowhere comes
this thing, this monster,

27:24.374 --> 27:26.639
I never seen anything
like it before.

27:26.640 --> 27:30.309
Because it took the three
guys and threw them away.

27:30.310 --> 27:34.810
I don't know what it was but, but God
bless him, 'cause he saved my life.

27:47.046 --> 27:48.953
Alright, boys.

27:49.100 --> 27:51.100
Chief, what have you got?

27:51.803 --> 27:55.825
That alleyway was the most
gruesome sight I have ever seen.

27:55.826 --> 27:57.640
Gruesome, huh?

27:58.100 --> 28:00.099
Have you ever met my mother-in-law?

28:00.100 --> 28:02.099
Now, that's gruesome

28:02.100 --> 28:03.278
What about Cigar Face?

28:03.279 --> 28:05.099
Have we gotten anything
out of him yet?

28:05.100 --> 28:08.099
He must still be in shock.
All he does is sit around

28:08.100 --> 28:11.514
all day babbling about
some seven foot monster.

28:11.515 --> 28:14.599
Yeah, and the only other clue
we've got are those mops,

28:14.600 --> 28:16.599
stuffed in their mouths.

28:16.600 --> 28:21.145
Mops... It must be some sort of political
statement. Do we have any suspects?

28:21.146 --> 28:26.099
Nah, the whole town is suspect. Knuckles
and Nipples were hated by everyone.

28:26.100 --> 28:29.599
Not by me. They were our
two best producers.

28:29.600 --> 28:31.919
Speaking of which, I almost forgot.

28:31.920 --> 28:35.557
The boys made their rounds last
night and here is the collection.

28:35.558 --> 28:37.614
Yeah, and it would've been
double if it wasn't for this

28:37.615 --> 28:40.841
devastating tragic turn of events.

28:40.842 --> 28:42.216
Yeah.

29:39.818 --> 29:43.099
Slug, will you stop with
that Elephant Man bullshit.

29:43.100 --> 29:49.232
I am not an animal.
I'm Melvin, the mop boy.

29:57.100 --> 30:00.508
- Who is it?
- It's me, Ma. Melvin.

30:09.100 --> 30:12.114
Ma? Ah, Ma!

31:20.928 --> 31:25.028
Tom. Tom, is he dead?

31:25.029 --> 31:26.713
Hey, Tom.

31:27.600 --> 31:31.303
Yeah, over here. Tom, the
zoning board has designated

31:31.304 --> 31:35.765
the old Rawlins Chemical Plant as
the new toxic waste dump site.

31:36.100 --> 31:40.368
Now that's contaminated, but
valuable waterfront property.

31:44.826 --> 31:49.051
We think it's a crime to let that
property go to waste as a dump.

31:49.052 --> 31:52.324
You are aware, of course, that that
would place our new toxic chemical dump

31:52.325 --> 31:55.647
just 20 feet from the reservoir
for the entire area.

32:01.600 --> 32:04.584
Gentlemen, I think we have a deal.

32:06.114 --> 32:09.672
Here to better living
through chemistry.

32:31.716 --> 32:35.716
Mr. Fred! Mr. Fred, what's
wrong with this thing!?

32:50.114 --> 32:51.216
Alright, everybody!

32:51.217 --> 32:54.293
Drop your tacos or I'll
blow your brains out!

32:56.787 --> 32:58.715
Rico, get the cash register!

32:58.716 --> 33:01.158
Okay, you got it!

33:02.229 --> 33:04.393
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

33:04.412 --> 33:07.372
We are the entertainment
for this afternoon.

33:07.373 --> 33:11.889
Now on shotgun, we've
got my man Leroy.

33:12.467 --> 33:16.638
On cash register we've
got magic fingers, Rico!

33:16.639 --> 33:18.069
That's me.

33:18.201 --> 33:22.405
And last but not least,
yours truly Frank.

33:23.811 --> 33:25.366
On the stick.

33:27.561 --> 33:28.984
Shut up!

33:29.740 --> 33:32.068
Now if you all do just
what we tell you,

33:32.069 --> 33:36.783
you just might, just might get
your asses home all intact.

33:37.982 --> 33:43.416
Look who we got here!
A little mother, and a littler baby.

33:44.232 --> 33:46.884
Do you like Mexican
food, little baby?

33:47.219 --> 33:48.969
Well, How'd you like to
have this hot tamale

33:48.970 --> 33:51.072
shoved down your throat?

33:53.186 --> 33:54.923
What are you looking at?

33:57.400 --> 34:00.360
Hey, Frank, teeny boppers!

34:00.609 --> 34:02.399
You like video games,
teeny boppers?

34:02.400 --> 34:04.985
Your mom give you
quarters for video games?

34:04.986 --> 34:06.635
Well, cough them up!

34:07.508 --> 34:10.117
Hey, this one's cute, Frank.

34:10.118 --> 34:12.492
Look how cute she is, Frank.

34:12.493 --> 34:14.746
Say, Leroy, I think she likes you.

34:22.040 --> 34:24.324
Hey, why don't you leave her alone?

34:26.259 --> 34:28.668
We'll give you our money,
if you want money.

34:29.054 --> 34:31.359
Hey, look, pal, why don't
you just let everyone go

34:31.360 --> 34:33.399
and keep me as a hostage, huh?

34:33.400 --> 34:34.376
Huh?

34:34.641 --> 34:37.330
That's an idea, ainft it, Frank?

34:37.400 --> 34:39.291
- Yeah.
- No, thanks.

34:50.632 --> 34:53.909
Shut up! It was self defense.

34:56.502 --> 35:00.686
Yo, Leroy, check out this
pretty little thing,

35:00.767 --> 35:03.302
and the bitch got a dog.

35:04.353 --> 35:07.539
Hey, wait a minute.
I think this bitch is blind.

35:07.540 --> 35:10.068
Are you sure she is blind, Frank?

35:13.056 --> 35:15.453
Yeah, the bitch is blind.

35:15.454 --> 35:16.195
Ow!

35:16.196 --> 35:18.460
Hey, what are you doing?
Don't do that!

35:18.461 --> 35:19.782
Let go of me!

35:20.900 --> 35:24.235
Yo, Leroy, you want to
walk this damn dog!

35:24.673 --> 35:26.344
Yeah, sure, Frank.

35:30.111 --> 35:31.463
Gary?

35:33.142 --> 35:35.788
Harry! What have you
done to my dog?

35:35.789 --> 35:38.220
I didn't do anything to
the dog, but listen...

35:38.236 --> 35:39.333
Gary! Gary!

35:39.334 --> 35:40.762
You wanna meet my friend, Ben?

35:40.763 --> 35:43.387
We's make everything alright.
Just let me introduce you to Ben.

35:43.388 --> 35:44.461
Ben who!?

35:44.462 --> 35:46.962
Ben Dover!

35:49.775 --> 35:54.946
Hey, Leroy, you know I always did
want to cornhole me a blind bitch.

35:54.947 --> 35:56.179
Ow!

35:56.180 --> 35:58.027
I'm going to enjoy this!

36:02.110 --> 36:04.590
Yeah, it's going to be nice.

36:06.009 --> 36:07.894
What the shit!?

36:21.970 --> 36:24.197
Okay, you motherfucker!

39:26.290 --> 39:30.164
No, no, no! We were only kidding!

39:30.165 --> 39:33.094
What's the matter?
You can't take a joke?

39:33.095 --> 39:34.727
We were only kidding.

39:34.728 --> 39:37.500
Please, no!
You can't do this to me!

39:40.196 --> 39:43.155
No! Please! Please, stop it!

39:43.156 --> 39:46.265
Stop, no! No!

39:46.266 --> 39:48.891
No! We were, we were only kidding!

40:31.509 --> 40:35.467
Please, please don't touch me!

40:35.900 --> 40:36.899
Please!

40:36.900 --> 40:40.211
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, it's alright.
I'm not going to hurt you.

40:40.212 --> 40:41.336
Are you okay?

40:41.337 --> 40:45.180
Yes, I think so. My dog!

40:45.181 --> 40:49.423
Those men killed my dog!
They shot my dog!

40:49.477 --> 40:52.336
Could you take me out
of here, please?

40:53.860 --> 40:58.124
Please. I'll never make it
by myself without my dog.

40:58.125 --> 40:59.242
Please.

40:59.243 --> 41:03.766
Okay, alright, but come on,
let's go out the back way.

41:03.767 --> 41:07.593
Hey, don't worry, I won't hurt you.
Come on, I'll help you up.

41:33.994 --> 41:36.981
- Don't trip over the step, Melvin.
- What?

41:38.900 --> 41:40.934
I'd better get my cane.

41:45.384 --> 41:46.515
Why don't you have a seat?

41:46.516 --> 41:47.899
There's a place for
you on your left.

41:47.900 --> 41:48.906
Right over there.

41:48.907 --> 41:50.250
Ow!

41:50.251 --> 41:51.899
Would like you like
something to eat?

41:51.900 --> 41:52.899
Uh-huh.

41:52.900 --> 41:54.695
Is peanut butter and jelly, okay?

41:54.696 --> 41:55.758
Uh-huh.

41:55.759 --> 41:57.145
Good.

41:59.236 --> 42:01.762
Now, boys, what have we got here?

42:02.205 --> 42:05.454
Looks like we got a nice crispy
taco supreme over here, chief.

42:08.150 --> 42:11.527
Looks like I got a a strawberry
thickshake over here.

42:13.126 --> 42:14.180
What have you got?

42:14.181 --> 42:16.863
I've got a pizza with
the works to go, Jimmy.

42:17.267 --> 42:21.649
Chief, it was unbelievable.
It had an eye up over here,

42:21.650 --> 42:23.930
His nose was twisted to the side.

42:23.931 --> 42:24.631
Huh?

42:24.632 --> 42:27.054
It was the strangest thing
I ever saw in my life.

42:27.055 --> 42:30.609
Sure. But it was a
pink elephant, too.

42:30.610 --> 42:33.311
I'm telling ya, these guys
were going to kill us.

42:33.312 --> 42:36.836
It saved our lives. It was a hero.

42:36.837 --> 42:38.621
A hero!

42:40.243 --> 42:41.879
This guy is drunk.

42:45.400 --> 42:47.492
Would you mind if I
touched your face?

42:47.493 --> 42:48.093
No!

42:48.094 --> 42:52.039
No? Why not?
I won't hurt you, Melvin.

42:52.040 --> 42:56.547
It's not that. It's just that
I have a rash on my face.

42:56.548 --> 42:59.000
A rash? You mean acne?

42:59.001 --> 43:02.055
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's it.
It's nothing to worry about

43:02.056 --> 43:03.899
but I wouldn't want
you to touch it.

43:03.900 --> 43:06.399
You shouldn't be ashamed of acne.

43:06.400 --> 43:09.399
Everybody's had acne at
one time or another.

43:09.400 --> 43:12.836
Hey, I know. Would you like
me to tell your fortune?

43:12.837 --> 43:13.555
Huh?

43:13.556 --> 43:16.630
I read palms. Give me your hand.

43:19.300 --> 43:22.058
What big hands you have.

43:22.246 --> 43:24.605
I bet you're very strong.

43:24.725 --> 43:27.399
Hmm. Let me see.
You're going to have

43:27.400 --> 43:30.899
a lot of good things coming
too you in the future.

43:30.900 --> 43:34.399
You're going to become
a very important man.

43:34.400 --> 43:36.996
Let me see your other hand.

43:41.461 --> 43:44.469
Oops! Sorry.

43:51.870 --> 43:53.916
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

43:53.917 --> 43:57.399
With us this afternoon is,
Dr. Mertyn Snodberger

43:57.400 --> 44:00.899
from the Garden State State
Cerebral Reflex Research Center.

44:00.900 --> 44:03.087
Ah, can you tell me, sir,

44:03.088 --> 44:06.719
is it true that the monster
only attacks bad people?

44:06.720 --> 44:12.399
Ja. Ja. Since only bad, evil
people have been destroyed

44:12.400 --> 44:18.320
by the monster, I would have
to answer your question. Ja.

44:18.321 --> 44:21.526
From traces that have
been found on the scenes

44:21.527 --> 44:25.899
of the crime, and analyzed,
we have determined

44:25.900 --> 44:29.399
that whatever it is, this
monster has been exposed

44:29.400 --> 44:32.961
to toxic chemical waste.

44:33.103 --> 44:35.070
Achoo!

44:39.400 --> 44:44.399
It is also highly probable
that this monster may

44:44.400 --> 44:48.399
have developed a very basic
instinct which draws him,

44:48.400 --> 44:55.128
or should I say, commands
him to destroy evil.

45:12.845 --> 45:15.703
That new camera really
captures the moment!

45:15.704 --> 45:20.542
I know. The reds are so red!
Really get me hot!

45:31.908 --> 45:32.718
Mr. Mayor?

45:32.719 --> 45:33.273
Yeah?

45:33.274 --> 45:37.733
I got todayfs receipts from
the drug division. Ha ha!

45:37.734 --> 45:40.383
Good boy, Dennis. Put it
over there on the table.

45:40.384 --> 45:42.402
Bookie will get to it later.

48:11.086 --> 48:13.177
Listen, you asshole, how
many times are you going to

48:13.178 --> 48:15.216
pull that Elephant Man joke?

48:31.595 --> 48:34.025
Let this be a lesson
to you, hot ass!

48:41.634 --> 48:45.672
This monster may have developed
a very basic instinct,

48:45.673 --> 48:49.137
to destroy evil.

48:49.220 --> 48:51.406
Hey, you! In the alley!

48:51.407 --> 48:57.188
Hey, knucklehead! How about
some nice young poontang, huh?

48:57.189 --> 49:01.061
No! No, take me home!
No, take me home!

49:01.062 --> 49:03.023
No, you lied to me!

49:03.024 --> 49:06.116
You said you were going to take me
to see the David Bowie concert!

49:06.117 --> 49:08.405
He's not David Bowie!

49:09.101 --> 49:14.265
Only twelve years old,
and only twelve dollars!

49:18.486 --> 49:21.366
Boys! Boys! Help!

49:24.944 --> 49:27.944
Help, boys! Help!

50:00.040 --> 50:02.140
And you can tell all your
scum friends that things

50:02.141 --> 50:04.609
are going to change in this town!

50:04.610 --> 50:06.815
I'm not just another pretty face!

50:33.246 --> 50:36.366
Two prime candidates.

50:36.367 --> 50:37.750
Yeah.

50:37.751 --> 50:39.973
Rack 'em up!

50:50.220 --> 50:52.720
- Wow!
- Wow!

51:54.532 --> 51:56.547
I hear the monster is so big.

51:56.548 --> 51:59.148
Well, I bet he's got his eye on me.

51:59.149 --> 52:01.727
For your information, everyone
knows Monster Prefer Blondes!

52:01.728 --> 52:04.321
There's a feeling going
around town that this monster

52:04.322 --> 52:06.508
is here to protect the people.

52:06.509 --> 52:09.367
And the jail's are
becoming overcrowded.

52:09.368 --> 52:13.141
This monster has cleaned the
streets of every criminal.

52:13.142 --> 52:18.141
Almost all the criminals.
He hasn't gotten us yet.

52:18.142 --> 52:20.586
What the hell are we going to
do about this monster, eh?

52:20.587 --> 52:23.469
I'll tell you what we're going
to do. We're going to kill him.

52:23.470 --> 52:28.727
Because if we don't kill
him, he's going to kill us.

52:33.291 --> 52:36.624
I owe you for the other
night, monster fagot!

52:41.400 --> 52:44.680
So now we're going to give
you six new assholes,

52:44.681 --> 52:47.967
compliments of me, Cigar Face!

53:03.400 --> 53:06.719
Boom! You should've seen it!
His teeth was everywhere!

53:06.720 --> 53:09.220
They looked like Chiclets!

53:09.352 --> 53:11.935
Hey, what are you doing, blondie?

53:11.936 --> 53:13.617
I'm waiting for my boyfriend.

53:13.618 --> 53:14.913
She's waiting for her boyfriend.

53:14.914 --> 53:18.223
Well, maybe I'm going to
be your boyfriend, baby!

53:18.376 --> 53:21.687
Hey, stop that! My
boyfriend won't like that!

53:21.688 --> 53:25.427
Maybe we'll have to take care of
that wimp of a boyfriend, huh?

53:25.663 --> 53:26.898
Melvin! Melvin!

53:26.899 --> 53:27.727
Melvin!

53:27.728 --> 53:28.899
Melvin!?

53:28.900 --> 53:30.326
Melvin!

53:30.327 --> 53:33.774
Yeah, Melvin. What's up, guys?

53:53.610 --> 53:58.740
Why, Melvin, you're beautiful.
You're a beautiful person.

54:00.189 --> 54:06.005
You're so muscular. It's been
two years since I touched a man.

54:09.158 --> 54:14.728
What are you doing to me?
I've never felt like this before.

56:11.086 --> 56:12.312
Murderer!

56:17.220 --> 56:19.332
I'm gonna teach you a
lesson you'll never forget!

56:35.714 --> 56:36.419
No!

56:36.420 --> 56:38.220
Sorry, madam.

56:46.103 --> 56:49.940
Open up please, open up!

56:50.610 --> 56:55.110
Help me! Oh, please
open up! Help me!

57:01.649 --> 57:03.182
Going up?

57:05.756 --> 57:09.225
Let me out Let me out!
Please, someone help me!

58:22.540 --> 58:27.414
Aah! She's stressing me, Slug!
Julie is stressing me, Slug!

58:27.415 --> 58:29.649
I can't take it!
I cannot take this, Slug!

58:29.650 --> 58:31.507
She's not here with car
and I've got to drive.

58:31.508 --> 58:33.022
I gotta drive, Slug!
I gotta drive!

58:33.023 --> 58:35.444
Alright, already. Alright.
Will you chill out?

58:40.648 --> 58:44.921
Hey, how would you like
to be behind the wheel

58:44.922 --> 58:47.739
of a beautiful Japanese import?

58:50.322 --> 58:52.594
Oh, that would be good!

58:56.033 --> 58:58.187
Hi, can we help?

58:58.188 --> 59:00.180
Oh, you sure can.

59:01.033 --> 59:04.032
Thank you so much.
Oh, it's so nice to have you

59:04.033 --> 59:06.910
boys like you here
in the neighborhood.

59:12.603 --> 59:16.831
Oh, what a feeling, today!

59:26.533 --> 59:29.532
Did you see her face
when I punched her?

59:29.533 --> 59:32.260
I beat that old lady like a dog!

59:34.033 --> 59:36.255
Slug, there's that thing again!

59:37.736 --> 59:39.403
Let's get it!

59:46.282 --> 59:48.781
Shit! He's on the roof!
He's on the roof!

59:48.782 --> 59:51.147
Get him off! He's going
to kill both of us!

59:51.416 --> 59:54.115
Swerve the car, Bozo!
Swerve the car!

59:55.056 --> 59:57.283
I can't control the car!

01:00:03.337 --> 01:00:05.945
He's still there, swerve it again!
Swerve it again!

01:00:13.033 --> 01:00:16.033
I can't get him off the car, Slug!
I can't get him off!

01:00:20.149 --> 01:00:22.062
Slug, I'm going to die!

01:00:22.063 --> 01:00:25.131
Take the wheel, Slug!
Take the wheel!

01:00:25.218 --> 01:00:27.032
I'm stressed!

01:00:27.033 --> 01:00:28.483
Ah, what?

01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:30.720
What?

01:00:37.611 --> 01:00:39.611
Get out of here!

01:00:44.468 --> 01:00:45.718
No!

01:00:49.805 --> 01:00:51.648
See how you like this
face, huh, Bozo?

01:00:51.649 --> 01:00:54.760
You know who this is?
It's Melvin, that's who it is!

01:01:17.533 --> 01:01:20.126
Hey, hey, hey, what about
the kid on the bike, Bozo?

01:01:20.127 --> 01:01:23.127
How does it feel to hit a
kid on a bike? Feels good!

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:27.391
I've got problems! I've got
problems! I'm a stressed person!

01:01:31.951 --> 01:01:33.404
No, no!

01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:12.659
Give me the wheel!

01:02:15.033 --> 01:02:18.080
Just give me the wheel!
You'll going to kill both of us!

01:02:19.782 --> 01:02:24.282
You want the wheel?
Here, take the wheel!

01:03:35.533 --> 01:03:38.032
Yoohoo! Mr. Wilson!

01:03:38.033 --> 01:03:40.172
Mrs Haskel, how are you?

01:03:40.173 --> 01:03:41.423
Fine, thank you.

01:03:41.424 --> 01:03:43.211
How are the boys?

01:03:43.212 --> 01:03:46.977
Those boys are such terrors.
Especially Scott.

01:03:46.978 --> 01:03:50.251
He took his best girl out
last night and he came home

01:03:50.252 --> 01:03:53.539
with these stains,
all over his pants.

01:03:53.649 --> 01:03:55.646
I don't know what they are.

01:03:55.647 --> 01:03:56.882
I don't either.

01:03:56.883 --> 01:03:58.883
Do you think you can get them out?

01:04:00.071 --> 01:04:03.828
My car! They're putting
a ticket on my car!

01:04:03.829 --> 01:04:06.514
Mrs. Haskel, don't move. Don't
move. Stay right where you are.

01:04:06.515 --> 01:04:07.396
I'll be right back.

01:04:07.397 --> 01:04:10.717
You can't give me a ticket! You can't give
me a ticket! I have to go to a funeral...

01:04:13.782 --> 01:04:16.234
Hey, who do you think
you're pushing?

01:04:17.149 --> 01:04:18.742
What do you want?

01:04:18.906 --> 01:04:21.734
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me!

01:04:21.735 --> 01:04:25.699
Help! Help! Help! Help!

01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:30.086
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me! Help!

01:04:30.087 --> 01:04:32.578
Help! Help!

01:04:32.579 --> 01:04:33.858
What the...?

01:04:35.766 --> 01:04:38.553
Put me down! I didn't do anything!

01:04:44.822 --> 01:04:47.379
No Dickie here. No washie.

01:04:57.353 --> 01:05:01.853
Please, don't give me a ticket!
Please, don't give me a ticket!

01:05:06.502 --> 01:05:09.532
Okay, Mrs. Haskel, let's see what
we can do with these stains.

01:05:09.533 --> 01:05:13.508
Mrs. Haskel. Mrs. Haskel, what
are you doing back there?

01:05:13.509 --> 01:05:16.598
You know customers are not
allowed on that machine.

01:05:17.017 --> 01:05:19.017
Mrs. Haskel.

01:06:06.673 --> 01:06:09.242
Melvin, is that you?

01:06:12.775 --> 01:06:14.578
Melvin?

01:06:18.833 --> 01:06:20.474
Who's there?

01:06:21.613 --> 01:06:23.337
Who is that?

01:06:35.286 --> 01:06:38.786
It's me, Sarah. Only me.

01:06:39.027 --> 01:06:42.244
You scared me. Is something wrong?

01:06:42.245 --> 01:06:44.745
Everything is wrong.

01:06:44.996 --> 01:06:47.089
What the matter? What have I done?

01:06:47.090 --> 01:06:51.277
No, it's not what you've done.
It's what I've done.

01:06:51.278 --> 01:06:53.332
I think I'm out of control.

01:06:53.333 --> 01:06:57.730
You see, you're blind, Sara.
You don't know who I am.

01:06:58.333 --> 01:07:01.832
I'm really the monster
hero you heard about.

01:07:01.833 --> 01:07:04.924
And everyday I go out
and I mash people.

01:07:04.925 --> 01:07:07.902
I tear them apart and I can't stop.

01:07:07.903 --> 01:07:09.238
You better move back
to your apartment.

01:07:09.239 --> 01:07:10.769
I don't think its safe
for you to be around me.

01:07:10.770 --> 01:07:16.292
Oh, Melvin. I couldn't leave
you now. I love you, Melvin.

01:07:17.855 --> 01:07:20.832
I wish we could go somewhere.

01:07:20.833 --> 01:07:25.462
Yeah, some far away place.
Where there are no people.

01:07:25.463 --> 01:07:27.933
Where I can't kill anybody.

01:07:27.934 --> 01:07:31.332
What about that spot near Millers
farm that you told me about?

01:07:31.333 --> 01:07:33.332
Where you used to go to be alone.

01:07:33.333 --> 01:07:35.697
You said that was a
very special place.

01:07:35.698 --> 01:07:39.680
Well, we could try it.

01:07:40.333 --> 01:07:42.832
Do you think I look
inconspicuous enough?

01:07:42.833 --> 01:07:45.833
I'll feel better when
we get to the campsite.

01:07:48.090 --> 01:07:49.261
Mayor, Mayor!

01:07:49.262 --> 01:07:52.698
Chief, look. Our monster made
a little bit of a mistake.

01:07:52.699 --> 01:07:54.738
You can't go around dry
cleaning little old ladies

01:07:54.739 --> 01:07:56.832
the public won't stand for it.

01:07:56.833 --> 01:07:58.995
We can kill him now with
no flack from anybody.

01:07:58.996 --> 01:08:01.832
Nein, nein. Bad news, Mayor,

01:08:01.833 --> 01:08:05.113
That old lady was hardly a
pillar of the community.

01:08:05.114 --> 01:08:09.331
In fact, she can a head of an
international white slavery ring.

01:08:09.332 --> 01:08:09.878
Shit...

01:08:09.879 --> 01:08:12.950
And she had a police
record a mile long.

01:08:12.973 --> 01:08:14.332
We've got to cover this up.

01:08:14.333 --> 01:08:16.581
If it ever gets out to
the press we're sunk.

01:08:16.582 --> 01:08:19.665
And I want you to do me a favor.
Kill that bastard for me! You got it?

01:08:19.666 --> 01:08:20.254
Kill him!

01:08:20.255 --> 01:08:22.255
Yes, mein fuhrer. Mein mayor!

01:08:22.332 --> 01:08:25.090
Ladies and gentlemen, may I
have your attention please.

01:08:25.091 --> 01:08:27.832
Mayor Peter Bellgoode
will now take questions

01:08:27.832 --> 01:08:30.283
from the ladies and
gentlemen of the press.

01:08:33.629 --> 01:08:35.167
Uh, Miss Fink.

01:08:35.167 --> 01:08:38.667
What your administration stance in
regards to this alleged monster?

01:08:38.667 --> 01:08:40.551
Is he a menace or a miracle?

01:08:40.551 --> 01:08:43.566
He's definitely a menace, Miss Fink.
Right now therefs a massive

01:08:43.567 --> 01:08:48.054
search underway to find
the thing and destroy it.

01:08:48.832 --> 01:08:50.332
Yes, Mr. Leonard?

01:08:50.332 --> 01:08:52.332
Instead of trying to kill
him, shouldn't we be trying

01:08:52.332 --> 01:08:55.185
to capture him, bring
him in, study him?

01:08:55.185 --> 01:09:00.292
It is not a human being.
It is an it. You kill an it.

01:09:00.292 --> 01:09:01.471
Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor.

01:09:01.473 --> 01:09:02.487
Yes, Mr. Williams?

01:09:02.488 --> 01:09:06.082
The victim killed in the dry
cleaners, Mrs, ah, Haskel.

01:09:06.082 --> 01:09:07.831
What's her background?
What do we know about her?

01:09:07.832 --> 01:09:11.832
Mrs. Haskel was a member of our
community for over 30 years.

01:09:11.832 --> 01:09:15.832
Also a member of the PTA.
She had two fine sons.

01:09:15.832 --> 01:09:17.956
Everyone that know her, loved her.

01:09:17.957 --> 01:09:20.654
Question! Question!
Are you certain, Mr. Mayor,

01:09:20.654 --> 01:09:22.471
that the chief Himmel and
the police department

01:09:22.473 --> 01:09:24.451
can handle the situation
in Tromaville?

01:09:24.452 --> 01:09:28.238
I have the utmost regard for
the chief, and his department.

01:09:28.238 --> 01:09:30.252
As I've said, he's
conducting a massive search

01:09:30.254 --> 01:09:32.066
for the monster right now.

01:09:32.067 --> 01:09:35.832
I want this thing found and
I want this thing killed!

01:09:35.832 --> 01:09:38.832
The mayor has notified the
governor and he's prepared

01:09:38.832 --> 01:09:41.332
to give us all the
assistance we need.

01:09:41.332 --> 01:09:43.332
Should we break out
the heavy weapons?

01:09:43.332 --> 01:09:44.332
Come on, boys.

01:09:44.332 --> 01:09:46.832
I'd be dead right now if
it wasn't for the monster!

01:09:46.832 --> 01:09:50.332
Don't you think you're
being a bit hasty?

01:09:50.332 --> 01:09:54.332
Clancy, you will do as you're
told or you'll find yourself

01:09:54.333 --> 01:09:57.355
walking a beat in the city dump!

01:09:57.356 --> 01:10:02.652
Now I want this thing shot and
I want you to shoot to kill!

01:10:02.653 --> 01:10:06.339
That monster saved my life.
He's done a lot of good for this town.

01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:08.722
Why are they going to kill him?

01:10:08.723 --> 01:10:11.238
We should speak out! Do something!

01:10:11.239 --> 01:10:13.527
Roy, why don't you do
something! Speak out!

01:10:13.528 --> 01:10:15.715
You want me to speak up?
If I speak up,

01:10:15.716 --> 01:10:18.832
I lose my business license.
If I lose my business license,

01:10:18.833 --> 01:10:21.332
I'm dead. Do you
want another shake?

01:10:21.333 --> 01:10:24.527
No! I want them not
to kill the monster.

01:10:24.528 --> 01:10:26.332
I want us to do something!

01:10:26.333 --> 01:10:28.832
Listen, Johnny, you're just a kid.

01:10:28.833 --> 01:10:31.832
People can't go around doing
things just because they're right.

01:10:31.833 --> 01:10:33.832
We have to leave these
decisions up to the mayor

01:10:33.833 --> 01:10:35.832
- and the police chief.
- That's right.

01:10:35.833 --> 01:10:37.832
But why would the mayor
want to destroy something

01:10:37.833 --> 01:10:41.333
that does more good than
the entire police force?

01:10:42.333 --> 01:10:43.832
No offense.

01:10:43.833 --> 01:10:46.832
I know how you feel, Johnny,
he saved my life too.

01:10:46.833 --> 01:10:50.832
But us, little guys, are just not
qualified to make these decisions.

01:10:50.833 --> 01:10:53.332
That's why he's the mayor.

01:10:53.333 --> 01:10:55.833
Right?

01:10:58.333 --> 01:11:01.859
We're gonna find that bastard, now.
Come on. Come on, girl!

01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:02.963
Heel. Come on.

01:11:02.964 --> 01:11:06.094
My first day on the force
and I'm chasing monsters!

01:11:11.333 --> 01:11:13.392
The dogs got a scent!

01:11:18.083 --> 01:11:20.832
I'm missing the ball
game for this bullshit!

01:11:20.833 --> 01:11:22.332
We ain't going to find
no monster out here,

01:11:22.333 --> 01:11:25.832
all we're going to find is a bunch of
mosquitoes biting my fuckin' asshole!

01:11:25.833 --> 01:11:28.097
Shut your fuckin' mouth!

01:11:28.098 --> 01:11:29.901
Hold on a second,
I think I see something.

01:11:29.902 --> 01:11:31.039
You don't see nothing but a couple

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:33.832
of campers humping each other.
Come on, let's go home!

01:11:33.833 --> 01:11:35.832
Holy shit! It's the monster!

01:11:35.833 --> 01:11:36.832
Oh, sure!

01:11:36.833 --> 01:11:38.831
And he's got a bimbo with him!

01:11:38.832 --> 01:11:40.332
Oh, he's got your Mama with him!

01:11:40.333 --> 01:11:42.854
And she's wearing a bikini! Wow!

01:11:42.855 --> 01:11:44.832
Wait, let me see!

01:11:44.833 --> 01:11:48.266
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

01:11:49.833 --> 01:11:53.070
Come on, let's go tell the chief!
I'm going to get me a medal for this!

01:11:53.071 --> 01:11:55.236
Mayor! Mayor! Mayor!

01:11:55.653 --> 01:11:58.832
The monster has been sighted
in a field near Miller farm.

01:11:58.833 --> 01:11:59.832
That's wonderful!

01:11:59.833 --> 01:12:02.832
I'll have the National Guard
meet us out there in full force.

01:12:02.833 --> 01:12:03.713
You leave now!

01:12:03.714 --> 01:12:05.099
Ja!

01:12:05.333 --> 01:12:08.793
Hello, Mr. Governor,
how are you, sir?

01:12:08.794 --> 01:12:11.332
Fine, just fine.

01:12:11.333 --> 01:12:15.293
Governor, I need your help, sir.

01:12:15.294 --> 01:12:18.293
It's about this monster that's
been terrorizing my town.

01:12:18.294 --> 01:12:22.359
The local authorities can no
longer handle the situation.

01:12:23.231 --> 01:12:25.266
That's why I need your help.

01:12:25.627 --> 01:12:27.832
The National Guard?

01:12:27.833 --> 01:12:31.133
I was hoping you'd say
that, so we can kill it.

01:12:33.441 --> 01:12:38.793
Capture it? Well, I was
thinking the very same thing.

01:12:38.794 --> 01:12:43.762
Yes, capture would be fine.
Uh-huh. Well, thank you, Governor.

01:12:43.763 --> 01:12:47.263
Talk to you soon. Goodbye, sir.

01:12:50.161 --> 01:12:52.657
Capture, my ass!

01:13:07.597 --> 01:13:10.292
I don't like the way
this is going sargent.

01:13:10.293 --> 01:13:11.832
I know.

01:13:11.833 --> 01:13:14.672
The little people think he's
done a lot for this town.

01:13:19.606 --> 01:13:24.033
Oh, my God! They're calling
in the National Guard!

01:13:24.034 --> 01:13:26.332
Oh, look at all those men!

01:13:26.333 --> 01:13:27.832
Oh, I hope they don't
hurt the monster.

01:13:27.833 --> 01:13:30.800
Monster, they aught to give
him a medal, not kill him.

01:13:34.833 --> 01:13:39.233
They're going to nuke him!
They're going to nuke the monster!

01:13:45.333 --> 01:13:48.363
- They found the monster!
- He's at the Miller Farm!

01:13:48.364 --> 01:13:49.667
They're going to kill him!

01:13:49.668 --> 01:13:53.140
Holy cow! We can't let him die!

01:13:54.129 --> 01:13:56.629
Let's go!

01:14:42.214 --> 01:14:43.714
Out of the way!

01:14:43.761 --> 01:14:44.830
Stand aside.

01:14:44.831 --> 01:14:47.807
Tent's in the clearing, Mayor.
My troops have it surrounded.

01:14:47.808 --> 01:14:49.375
We think he's still asleep.

01:14:49.376 --> 01:14:52.393
Fine, we'll move in
and wipe him out.

01:14:52.394 --> 01:14:55.415
You can't do that, Mayor.
I've rechecked with headquarters

01:14:55.416 --> 01:14:57.588
They want us to take him
alive, not kill him.

01:14:57.589 --> 01:14:59.603
Your in charge, Pete.
Come on, give the orders!

01:14:59.604 --> 01:15:03.337
Mr. mayor, please, please,
think of what you are doing!

01:15:03.385 --> 01:15:05.697
There's an innocent
girl in there with him!

01:15:06.440 --> 01:15:08.400
Just one life for the whole town!

01:15:08.401 --> 01:15:10.297
But, Mr Mayor, you
don't understand!

01:15:10.298 --> 01:15:12.407
He saved my life!
He doesn't deserve to die!

01:15:12.408 --> 01:15:13.252
Shut up!

01:15:13.253 --> 01:15:16.361
Now you don't understand the seriousness
of this situation here, boy!

01:15:16.362 --> 01:15:20.799
How dare you discuss my son's
life or death like this.

01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:23.830
I'm Melvin's mother.
He's a good boy.

01:15:23.831 --> 01:15:26.179
He's never hurt anybody!

01:15:27.776 --> 01:15:33.086
Silence! Silence!
The orders have been given!

01:15:33.143 --> 01:15:36.971
It is our destiny to
follow the orders!

01:15:46.143 --> 01:15:50.111
You in the tent, come
out with your hands up!

01:15:50.112 --> 01:15:51.972
You are surrounded!

01:15:55.651 --> 01:15:57.873
The minute he comes out, kill him.

01:15:59.698 --> 01:16:01.229
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you're not.

01:16:01.230 --> 01:16:02.498
You've got to stay here.

01:16:02.499 --> 01:16:07.080
No, I can't let you do it! He's a hero.
I can't let you do it! I can't let you do it!

01:16:07.081 --> 01:16:09.604
Don't shoot him! Don't shoot!

01:16:09.605 --> 01:16:12.878
If you want to shoot my son,
you'll have to shoot me first!

01:16:20.539 --> 01:16:23.461
Okay, lads. Get these
kids out of there!

01:16:24.831 --> 01:16:26.853
It's okay, Mom. Kids.

01:16:26.854 --> 01:16:27.915
Shoot it!

01:16:27.916 --> 01:16:29.900
Run! Run!

01:16:29.901 --> 01:16:30.932
Fire!

01:16:30.933 --> 01:16:33.393
No, I won't do it.

01:16:33.394 --> 01:16:35.539
These kids are right.

01:16:40.510 --> 01:16:42.064
Captain, have your men fire!

01:16:42.065 --> 01:16:43.627
No, I can't.

01:16:43.628 --> 01:16:45.628
Shoot them! You shoot!

01:16:51.597 --> 01:16:52.424
Fire!

01:16:52.425 --> 01:16:53.478
Melvin!

01:16:53.479 --> 01:16:55.250
Alright, I'll do it myself!

01:16:55.251 --> 01:16:56.817
No!

01:16:56.956 --> 01:16:59.935
You touch me again
and I'll kill you!

01:17:18.065 --> 01:17:20.009
Get away from me!

01:17:21.238 --> 01:17:23.064
Get away from me!

01:17:24.253 --> 01:17:27.439
No! Ah, get away from me!

01:17:27.440 --> 01:17:29.939
Leave me alone!
Look, I'll make you a deal!

01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:32.157
I'll give you 10%, anything,
just leave alone!

01:17:32.924 --> 01:17:35.462
Don't hurt me!
I'm too young to die!

01:17:35.463 --> 01:17:36.978
Please don't hurt me!

01:17:36.979 --> 01:17:40.413
Please!

01:17:40.995 --> 01:17:44.334
You fat slob, let's see
if you have any guts!

01:17:59.815 --> 01:18:04.821
Officer O'Clancy, take
care of this toxic waste.

01:18:07.839 --> 01:18:09.432
Melvin!

01:18:09.433 --> 01:18:10.540
Sarah!

01:18:10.541 --> 01:18:11.556
Melvin!

01:18:11.557 --> 01:18:12.674
Sara!

01:18:12.675 --> 01:18:14.431
Melvin! Ah!

01:18:14.432 --> 01:18:15.595
Sarah!

01:18:15.596 --> 01:18:16.955
Melvin!

01:18:16.956 --> 01:18:18.332
Sarah!

01:18:18.333 --> 01:18:19.953
Melvin?

01:18:20.059 --> 01:18:21.395
Sarah!

01:18:44.331 --> 01:18:48.337
So, Melvin, the monster hero, rid
Tromaville of all of it's evils,

01:18:48.338 --> 01:18:52.406
so the good citizens could live
their lives in peace and happiness.

01:18:53.128 --> 01:18:56.344
And the next time you're in
danger or in need to help,

01:18:56.345 --> 01:19:00.726
look to the horizon and
maybe, just maybe...

01:19:01.542 --> 01:19:04.625
The Toxic Avenger will be there.
