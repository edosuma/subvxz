<i>Rip-Fixes-Sync
by VaVooM</i>

01:30.851 --> 01:32.419
Okay, I can smell 'em.

01:32.455 --> 01:34.354
Who brought in
the cinnamon buns?

01:34.390 --> 01:36.190
That would be me.

01:36.225 --> 01:37.825
Ed, how do I stick
to a low carb diet

01:37.860 --> 01:39.340
when you keep bringing in
baked goods?

01:39.495 --> 01:40.527
Not my problem.

01:41.830 --> 01:43.697
And napkin?

01:43.732 --> 01:45.098
Don't forget to tip your waiter.

01:46.335 --> 01:48.268
How's the sequel coming?

01:48.303 --> 01:50.048
Well as soon as Dylan
the unlikely warrior prince

01:50.072 --> 01:51.405
defeats the dragon

01:51.440 --> 01:52.817
I'll be sending it
to you for editing.

01:52.841 --> 01:54.274
Can't wait.

01:57.680 --> 01:59.112
- Hey! Carrie...
- Yes.

01:59.148 --> 02:01.114
I'm wondering if you,
you have a minute

02:01.150 --> 02:03.817
- I'd love to pitch you a story.
- Sure!

02:03.852 --> 02:05.652
So it's this story
about this fairy

02:05.688 --> 02:08.055
who leaves the fairy world
through a drop of dew

02:08.090 --> 02:09.489
and she becomes a real girl

02:09.525 --> 02:12.325
who befriends
this little lonely boy

02:12.361 --> 02:14.928
and together they go on
all sorts of misadventures.

02:14.963 --> 02:17.665
- I like it.
- You do?

02:17.700 --> 02:18.999
- Yeah.
- That's great!

02:19.034 --> 02:21.134
I have been working
on a rough draft

02:21.170 --> 02:22.335
so I can just keep plugging.

02:22.371 --> 02:25.105
Forward the idea to Ed.
Let the writers do the writing.

02:28.844 --> 02:29.810
I'm sorry, Jenny.

02:29.845 --> 02:32.913
Don't give up. Eventually,
one of these days

02:32.948 --> 02:34.948
she's gonna have to publish
one of your stories.

02:41.857 --> 02:44.624
All right, Mom.
Make a wish!

02:46.862 --> 02:50.330
- Happy Birthday, babe.
- Thank you.

02:50.365 --> 02:51.832
Meg.
How many layers is that?

02:51.867 --> 02:53.767
The one she's looking at
for the wedding is six.

02:54.002 --> 02:56.970
Does that mean you guys
are planning the big day?

02:57.005 --> 03:00.340
Actually, Tony and I have
a little announcement to make.

03:00.375 --> 03:02.676
Meg and I have finally
decided on a wedding day.

03:02.711 --> 03:04.344
Meg, Tony!

03:04.379 --> 03:07.514
I couldn't have asked for
a better birthday present!

03:07.549 --> 03:09.849
So when is it?
Spring? Summer?

03:09.885 --> 03:11.718
Winter, actually.

03:11.753 --> 03:13.320
So in a year!

03:13.355 --> 03:14.933
Well at least that gives us
plenty of time to plan.

03:14.957 --> 03:18.658
Actually, it's this year!
Like, in four weeks.

03:18.694 --> 03:19.893
What?

03:21.730 --> 03:22.862
Okay!

03:25.367 --> 03:28.535
Okay, don't freak out, everyone.
Because it's all planned out.

03:28.570 --> 03:31.338
We are all going
on a destination wedding.

03:31.373 --> 03:32.739
Is it Hawaii?

03:32.774 --> 03:35.375
Guys, let it be Hawaii.
I wanna learn how to surf!

03:35.410 --> 03:36.443
- It's not Hawaii.
- Well.

03:36.478 --> 03:38.778
It's exactly the opposite.

03:38.814 --> 03:42.816
We wanna get married
at "The" Ice Hotel.

03:44.086 --> 03:46.119
Isn't that different?

03:46.154 --> 03:47.420
And cold.

03:47.456 --> 03:48.555
I'll say!

03:48.590 --> 03:49.956
Mom, don't worry.

03:49.992 --> 03:51.536
They have everything we need
for the wedding...

03:51.560 --> 03:53.193
a beautiful little chapel,

03:53.228 --> 03:57.630
a whole village with cafes
and restaurants and shops.

03:57.666 --> 04:01.267
- What do you think?
- I think it sounds amazing.

04:01.303 --> 04:02.902
Mom?

04:02.938 --> 04:06.940
The Ice Hotel
is so beautifully magical.

04:06.975 --> 04:08.908
We really think
it would be a dream.

04:08.944 --> 04:11.244
Tell them to get ready

04:11.279 --> 04:14.948
because the Walshes are having
a wedding at the Ice Hotel!

04:16.284 --> 04:17.350
Perfect.

04:24.926 --> 04:28.461
Okay.
So, shoes and accessories.

04:28.497 --> 04:29.896
Check.

04:29.931 --> 04:31.331
Your dress... your dress!

04:31.366 --> 04:34.100
Yeah. Tony's just running it
up the street to get pressed.

04:34.136 --> 04:35.279
He's gonna take
the next shuttle.

04:35.303 --> 04:36.903
What do you think?

04:36.938 --> 04:38.683
Has Mom gotten over the fact
that she wasn't able

04:38.707 --> 04:42.242
to invite every single Walsh
in the country to the wedding?

04:42.277 --> 04:43.988
Maybe that's why
she's taking the later plane.

04:44.012 --> 04:45.623
Maybe she's packed the plane
with Walshes.

04:45.647 --> 04:49.527
Okay, good luck, 'cause we are
not gonna all fit in that hotel.

04:49.551 --> 04:53.319
Have you heard from
your boss about your book?

04:53.355 --> 04:55.355
She sees me more
as an editor, so.

04:55.390 --> 04:56.856
Shoot, I'm sorry.

04:56.892 --> 04:58.591
You know what?
I'm just gonna chalk it up

04:58.627 --> 05:00.860
to one of those things that
I haven't accomplished.

05:00.896 --> 05:02.262
That's not true.

05:02.297 --> 05:03.696
Let's see. I wanted to

05:03.732 --> 05:05.598
have enough money saved up
for a condo by now,

05:05.634 --> 05:06.800
that's a fail.

05:06.835 --> 05:08.435
I wanted to be married
by now, fail.

05:08.470 --> 05:10.937
- I wanted to go to New Zealand by now...
- Okay.

05:10.972 --> 05:12.672
Okay. Hefty goals.

05:12.707 --> 05:15.041
But don't worry.
Don't give up,

05:15.077 --> 05:17.677
'cause I have a plan for you
and his name is Craig.

05:19.414 --> 05:21.781
Like... like a setup?
No, Meg.

05:21.817 --> 05:24.551
You know, odds of failure
are very high.

05:24.586 --> 05:26.286
I know, but he's perfect!

05:26.321 --> 05:29.155
He's handsome, he's sweet,
he's a single dad...

05:29.191 --> 05:30.356
He's divorced?

05:30.392 --> 05:32.392
His wife passed away
two years ago.

05:32.427 --> 05:34.727
But he was sad too
for a little while

05:34.763 --> 05:36.496
and Tony said
he's doing great now.

05:36.531 --> 05:37.564
Hey, there.

05:37.599 --> 05:38.665
Plus, he's an amazing dad.

05:40.068 --> 05:42.035
And you're gonna have time
to figure that out

05:42.070 --> 05:43.848
because you're gonna
hang out with him all week

05:43.872 --> 05:46.673
- 'cause he's the best man.
- I don't know.

05:46.708 --> 05:49.220
Honestly, he's perfect.
He's a go-getter, just like you.

05:49.244 --> 05:52.045
You know what?
We'll... we'll see. Okay?

05:52.080 --> 05:53.179
I mean, it is an ice hotel.

05:53.215 --> 05:54.881
- It is kind of...
- Well.

05:54.916 --> 05:56.249
...romantic.

05:56.284 --> 05:58.251
Oh my gosh!
That's what I'm gonna do!

05:58.286 --> 06:00.653
I'm gonna write a story
about an ice castle!

06:00.689 --> 06:01.889
This is what I love about you.

06:01.923 --> 06:03.590
- You never really give up.
- I know.

06:03.625 --> 06:05.692
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's do this.

06:08.396 --> 06:10.063
I wonder how far the hotel is.

06:10.098 --> 06:12.799
I've heard the scenery
is beautiful!

06:45.800 --> 06:47.333
What?!

06:51.173 --> 06:52.805
It's real!

06:52.841 --> 06:54.774
What do you think?

06:54.809 --> 06:57.210
I think it's like something
out of a fairy tale.

06:57.245 --> 06:58.645
I know.

06:58.680 --> 07:00.780
And I get to have
my happily ever after in it.

07:00.815 --> 07:01.815
Ice!

07:06.421 --> 07:09.222
Full ice everywhere!

07:11.493 --> 07:15.006
- What a piece of art this is!
- I think it's like a circus theme.

07:15.030 --> 07:16.229
- Cool.
- Yep.

07:16.264 --> 07:19.899
- 'Cause all of it has...
- There's art everywhere you look!

07:19.935 --> 07:21.234
It's stunning.

07:21.269 --> 07:22.835
Look at this wall.
I love this wall.

07:22.871 --> 07:23.970
Welcome to the Ice Hotel!

07:24.005 --> 07:25.016
- Thank you.
- And you are?

07:25.040 --> 07:27.006
- The Walshes.
- The Walshes.

07:27.042 --> 07:28.741
Yes, the wedding party.
Congratulations.

07:28.777 --> 07:30.009
Thank you.

07:30.045 --> 07:31.578
I'm Peter, the concierge.

07:31.613 --> 07:33.291
Our bellmen will be happy
to show you your rooms.

07:33.315 --> 07:34.948
- Perfect!
- We'll see you at dinner.

07:34.983 --> 07:37.650
Do you think I could take a bit
of a tour before I go to my room?

07:37.686 --> 07:38.930
It'd be my pleasure.
Just follow me.

07:38.954 --> 07:40.486
Thank you.

07:40.522 --> 07:43.423
Every year the hotel
is built from scratch.

07:43.458 --> 07:45.425
Well, snow and ice really.

07:45.460 --> 07:48.828
And the sculptures and themes
change every year.

07:48.863 --> 07:50.174
How long does it take
to build all this?

07:50.198 --> 07:51.831
About two months,

07:51.866 --> 07:54.367
including the two weeks
artists spend carving sculptures

07:54.402 --> 07:55.935
and transforming the hotel

07:55.971 --> 07:58.304
into a totally unique
temporary piece of art.

08:03.411 --> 08:04.811
Look at this, Dad!

08:04.846 --> 08:07.013
This is so fun!

08:09.251 --> 08:10.461
We have a lounge
which is heated,

08:10.485 --> 08:13.620
and if you like your drinks cold,
but I mean really cold,

08:13.655 --> 08:15.955
- all our drinks are literally served on ice.
- What?!

08:15.991 --> 08:17.123
Sara.

08:17.158 --> 08:19.792
Hey, hey.

08:19.828 --> 08:20.994
Kids just love it here.

08:21.029 --> 08:23.763
I bet.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.666
Let's go!

08:26.701 --> 08:28.468
Slow down.

08:30.605 --> 08:32.105
This way.

08:39.714 --> 08:42.081
This is crazy!

09:11.613 --> 09:14.914
We have 45 rooms,
each designed with a different theme.

09:14.949 --> 09:18.017
You'll be staying in what we
like to call the polar room.

09:25.760 --> 09:28.695
Oh, my.
This is amazing!

09:28.730 --> 09:30.430
Look at my bed!
It's even made of ice.

09:30.465 --> 09:33.533
And my very own stove.

09:33.568 --> 09:34.912
It's not gonna melt anything,
is it?

09:34.936 --> 09:36.369
I should hope not.

09:36.404 --> 09:37.615
So, if you have
everything you need,

09:37.639 --> 09:38.749
I'll leave you to get settled.

09:38.773 --> 09:40.106
I do!
Thank you so much.

09:40.141 --> 09:41.574
Enjoy.

09:56.691 --> 09:59.525
What? An ice slide?

10:06.768 --> 10:07.834
Yes!

10:15.210 --> 10:16.876
Okay.

10:24.185 --> 10:27.153
- Here.
- Oh my goodness.

10:27.188 --> 10:29.756
Here, let me help you.
That was quite the run.

10:29.791 --> 10:30.923
Thank you!

10:30.959 --> 10:34.093
- Have you tried this?
- No.

10:34.129 --> 10:35.361
No, we're just checking in.

10:35.397 --> 10:37.964
Well when you do,
make sure you try a lot.

10:37.999 --> 10:39.699
Okay.

10:39.734 --> 10:42.769
All right, come on, let's go.
Nice meeting you.

10:48.376 --> 10:51.677
Skating, dog sledding?

10:51.713 --> 10:53.546
Carriage rides!

10:53.581 --> 10:55.214
Do they have tobogganing?

10:55.250 --> 10:58.050
Yeah. You know what,
it says right here

10:58.086 --> 10:59.997
they have some of the biggest
tobogganing hills around

11:00.021 --> 11:01.387
which means
you kinda gotta do it.

11:01.423 --> 11:05.024
- Can we, Daddy?
- Well, when in Rome...

11:05.059 --> 11:06.359
Have you ever been there?

11:06.394 --> 11:09.395
The people, the architecture,
the food!

11:09.431 --> 11:11.731
I gotta say,
I love this enthusiasm.

11:11.766 --> 11:15.368
Daddy, did you remember
to send Tony's tie to his room?

11:15.403 --> 11:16.847
I did, yes. And thank you
for reminding me.

11:16.871 --> 11:19.672
- Are you here for the wedding?
- Yeah.

11:19.707 --> 11:21.018
I'm Jenny,
I'm the maid of honour.

11:21.042 --> 11:22.208
I'm Meg's sister.

11:22.243 --> 11:23.743
No way!
I'm the best man.

11:23.778 --> 11:25.055
I'm Craig.
This is my daughter Sara.

11:25.079 --> 11:27.046
- You're the best man.
- Yeah.

11:27.081 --> 11:30.216
- Pleasure to meet you, Jenny.
- You too.

11:30.251 --> 11:34.921
- What are you gonna sign up for?
- Well, anything I can, really.

11:34.956 --> 11:37.990
I mean, carriage rides. Who can
say no to carriage rides, right?

11:38.026 --> 11:39.603
Something tells me
you don't say no to too much.

11:39.627 --> 11:41.093
Well, why would you?

11:41.129 --> 11:43.009
The more you say no to
the more you miss out on.

11:44.699 --> 11:46.666
Well, we have to
get ready for dinner,

11:46.701 --> 11:48.501
but, we'll see you around.

11:48.536 --> 11:50.336
Yes, you will.

11:50.371 --> 11:52.238
Bye!

11:58.980 --> 12:02.081
Okay, you were totally right.
He is handsome.

12:02.116 --> 12:04.750
And kind and his little girl
is so cute!

12:04.786 --> 12:08.888
- He's a catch!
- Yes, you had a good plan.

12:10.058 --> 12:11.757
Hi, Jenny.

12:11.793 --> 12:14.038
I think I just hitched Jenny up
with the man of her dreams.

12:14.062 --> 12:15.228
And who's that?

12:15.263 --> 12:18.264
You know, just your best man.
Or should I say "best catch".

12:18.299 --> 12:21.200
But the best catch
invited a plus one.

12:21.236 --> 12:24.604
- Oh, no! When?
- I didn't think it was a big deal.

12:24.639 --> 12:28.040
I got Jenny all psyched about it!
Who is it? Who's the plus one?

12:28.076 --> 12:29.742
Come here, come here.

12:29.777 --> 12:31.422
You think we'll need
to sleep with a hat on?

12:31.446 --> 12:33.246
I think it's a good idea
but you know what?

12:33.281 --> 12:35.259
In this cold, we're all gonna
sleep like hibernating bears!

12:35.283 --> 12:36.283
- Hey.
- Hey!

12:36.317 --> 12:38.451
How was your flight?

12:38.486 --> 12:40.319
It was good! I'm just
really happy to be here.

12:40.355 --> 12:42.655
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

12:42.690 --> 12:44.123
- I don't know.
- Who is that?

12:44.158 --> 12:46.504
Lana, I just...
I want to introduce you to Jenny.

12:46.528 --> 12:49.262
- She is the maid of honour.
- Hello!

12:49.297 --> 12:50.997
It's very nice to meet you.

12:51.032 --> 12:52.999
Sorry my hands might be
a little cold.

12:53.034 --> 12:55.601
I'm not too sure what's more frigid,
the outside or the hotel!

12:55.637 --> 12:57.336
It's the outside,
actually. Yeah.

12:57.372 --> 12:59.149
The hotel stays at a solid
23 degrees Fahrenheit

12:59.173 --> 13:02.542
or -5 degrees Celsius
to be exact.

13:05.547 --> 13:07.313
It's a good thing
I brought my sun lamp!

13:07.348 --> 13:08.926
You know, we could all use
some extra vitamin D.

13:08.950 --> 13:11.450
So, it's...
Look. She needs me.

13:11.486 --> 13:14.487
- She seems nice.
- Yeah.

13:14.522 --> 13:16.589
Lana, this is Tony.
He's the groom.

13:16.624 --> 13:18.257
Hi!

13:18.293 --> 13:20.271
This is the most original
wedding I've ever been to.

13:20.295 --> 13:22.795
When I found out the destination,
I knew I just had to come.

13:24.532 --> 13:28.434
We're just gonna go sit down.

13:28.469 --> 13:30.136
- So sorry.
- It's no biggie.

13:30.171 --> 13:31.704
Guys, I didn't even
get my hopes up.

13:31.739 --> 13:34.373
Tony, seriously, you have to do
some reconnaissance.

13:34.409 --> 13:35.786
Tony, you do not need
to play detective.

13:35.810 --> 13:37.810
I'm good. We're good!
It's...

13:37.845 --> 13:40.680
- Cool, cool.
- Exactly. It's cool. It's cool!

13:44.619 --> 13:46.085
Mom! Dad!

13:46.121 --> 13:47.654
- Hey.
- Hi!

13:47.689 --> 13:49.188
You made it!

13:49.224 --> 13:51.190
- We did.
- Yeah!

13:51.226 --> 13:52.603
But I'm glad we took
the later flight

13:52.627 --> 13:54.827
just to make sure
I had everything.

13:54.863 --> 13:56.663
Yeah, including
our best winter thermals.

13:56.698 --> 13:58.665
You are gonna need those.

13:58.700 --> 14:00.700
And don't be hogging
the sleeping bag, Dad.

14:00.735 --> 14:02.335
He'll be out
in the cold if he does!

14:03.638 --> 14:06.172
- So, did you meet him?
- Who?

14:06.207 --> 14:08.408
Tony's best man Craig.

14:08.443 --> 14:10.710
Well, Meg didn't quite
do her homework

14:10.745 --> 14:12.679
because Craig
brought a plus one.

14:12.714 --> 14:16.416
- I'm sorry, sweetheart.
- Onto the next adventure.

14:16.451 --> 14:17.762
Tomorrow I go
cross-country skiing.

14:17.786 --> 14:19.285
- Nice.
- So I'm gonna get some sleep.

14:19.321 --> 14:21.065
- Okay.
- All right, we'll see you in the morning.

14:21.089 --> 14:22.769
- Yeah, love you.
- Good night, sweetheart.

14:29.464 --> 14:32.565
- You and Sara have a good sleep.
- Thanks, you too.

14:35.337 --> 14:36.836
Night.

14:41.409 --> 14:42.775
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

14:42.811 --> 14:45.378
<i>in the far reaches of the north,</i>

14:45.413 --> 14:48.548
<i>there was a snowy kingdom</i>

14:48.583 --> 14:49.916
<i>with a castle made of ice</i>

14:49.951 --> 14:52.819
<i>whose walls told stories</i>

14:52.854 --> 14:54.287
<i>of the people and animals</i>

14:54.322 --> 14:56.255
<i>who lived in the kingdom.</i>

14:57.625 --> 15:00.393
<i>This is one such story.</i>

15:10.205 --> 15:13.439
Can I give you this?
Thank you so much.

15:13.475 --> 15:15.808
Hi! Hi, excuse me.

15:15.844 --> 15:17.443
I know that this
is an ice hotel.

15:17.479 --> 15:20.113
I guess I just wasn't
expecting it to be so cold

15:20.148 --> 15:22.248
and I thought the rooms
were gonna be warmer, and...

15:22.283 --> 15:24.817
- Everything okay?
- Yeah! Everything's fine!

15:24.853 --> 15:26.619
I'm just asking
for another blanket.

15:27.856 --> 15:30.289
- I hope you're not too cold.
- No, I'm fine!

15:30.325 --> 15:32.458
Okay. All right,
well, good night.

15:32.494 --> 15:34.127
Good night!

15:35.530 --> 15:36.941
Can you please get me
two extra blankets

15:36.965 --> 15:37.997
and a hot water bottle?

15:55.183 --> 15:57.484
- You're an early riser.
- Yeah, always.

15:57.519 --> 15:59.653
Do you wanna join us?

16:00.856 --> 16:02.422
Yes. Thank you.

16:04.259 --> 16:05.699
Daddy says you have to
seize the day.

16:05.860 --> 16:08.595
You know what?
That's my motto too!

16:08.630 --> 16:10.597
So, how did both of you sleep?

16:11.332 --> 16:14.700
We slept like a couple
hibernating bears, didn't we?

16:14.735 --> 16:18.337
Except I really wish hadn't
forgotten to bring my storybook.

16:18.372 --> 16:22.041
In the scramble of trying to
catch the flight here, I...

16:22.076 --> 16:24.209
I kind of forgot Sara's books.

16:24.245 --> 16:26.312
You could always
make something up.

16:26.347 --> 16:28.414
I'm not really great at that.

16:28.449 --> 16:31.817
Last night he did start telling
me a story about a polar bear.

16:31.852 --> 16:34.320
Keeping with the bear theme.
I like it!

16:34.355 --> 16:38.223
- How did it go?
- There was this polar bear.

16:38.259 --> 16:39.925
- His name was Snowball.
- Nice.

16:39.961 --> 16:42.861
And he was looking
for his family.

16:42.897 --> 16:45.597
- And then...
- Daddy fell asleep.

16:45.633 --> 16:46.865
No!

16:47.935 --> 16:50.169
Dad.

16:50.204 --> 16:53.005
You know what?
I bet I know what happened next.

16:53.040 --> 16:55.274
So, on his way
to visit his family,

16:55.309 --> 16:58.510
a great blizzard swept across
the icy landscape.

16:58.546 --> 17:02.748
The wind whipped.
And the snow was so thick

17:02.783 --> 17:05.416
that Snowball couldn't see
where he was going.

17:05.453 --> 17:07.752
Suddenly there was a loud crack,

17:07.788 --> 17:10.689
and the ground beneath Snowball
began to bob and sway.

17:10.724 --> 17:15.361
Blinded by the snow, you see,
he'd walked out onto an ice flow

17:15.396 --> 17:18.063
that broke away and now
he was drifting all alone

17:18.098 --> 17:20.132
through the frigid,
choppy waters.

17:20.166 --> 17:22.800
Suddenly a dark fin
emerged from the water.

17:22.837 --> 17:25.738
Snowball bellowed, "Help!"

17:25.772 --> 17:29.641
But he was too far from land,
drifting and drifting away.

17:29.677 --> 17:33.412
- And then...
- What happened?

17:33.447 --> 17:35.125
You know what?
You're gonna have to hear later.

17:35.149 --> 17:36.815
It's called a cliff-hanger!

17:36.851 --> 17:38.117
Hey.

17:38.152 --> 17:40.820
- How did you sleep?
- Very well.

17:40.855 --> 17:42.955
Right.

17:42.990 --> 17:46.125
Right... there is my sister.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.393
So, I should go.

17:47.428 --> 17:48.961
But you know what?

17:48.996 --> 17:50.674
I promise I'm gonna finish
that story later, okay?

17:50.698 --> 17:52.264
Okay.

17:52.299 --> 17:54.600
Have a great day, guys.

17:54.635 --> 17:55.968
- Bye!
- Bye, love.

17:57.538 --> 17:59.840
Hey.
Is everything okay?

17:59.874 --> 18:01.540
No. I lost my bridal veil.

18:01.576 --> 18:03.309
- What?
- I know, what if we forgot it?

18:03.344 --> 18:04.944
If we left it at home
or the plane

18:04.979 --> 18:06.445
or the shuttle with the luggage.

18:06.481 --> 18:08.881
You know what? I'm sure
that it's gonna show up.

18:08.916 --> 18:10.449
Somebody will turn it in.

18:10.485 --> 18:12.162
Even if it doesn't,
we can find one in town.

18:12.186 --> 18:13.819
I'm sure of it, okay?

18:13.855 --> 18:15.466
Now I have to go 'cause
I'm gonna miss my ski group

18:15.490 --> 18:18.324
but I will find you
and help you later!

18:28.870 --> 18:31.137
Okay.

18:31.172 --> 18:35.274
Keep moving your arms and legs
like you're walking.

18:37.578 --> 18:38.911
I'm okay! I'm good!

18:38.946 --> 18:40.846
I got... I got this.

18:46.120 --> 18:49.889
Okay.
Okay. I got it.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.699
Okay.

19:07.074 --> 19:08.841
Okay.

19:09.911 --> 19:13.045
Post and share.

19:22.723 --> 19:23.789
Hey, guys?

19:24.892 --> 19:26.091
Guys, wait up. I'm coming!

19:27.762 --> 19:30.863
Okay.
I'll just follow the tracks.

19:30.898 --> 19:34.400
Follow the tracks.

19:39.340 --> 19:42.007
When in doubt, go right.

19:49.617 --> 19:52.484
Okay. No more.

20:01.362 --> 20:02.728
Please don't be a bear.

20:02.763 --> 20:04.603
Please don't be a bear,
please don't be a bear.

20:10.037 --> 20:11.837
You guys!

20:12.940 --> 20:16.775
I thought I heard a bear!
I'm so happy to see you.

20:16.811 --> 20:18.444
Bears?

20:19.881 --> 20:21.091
You don't have to worry,
sweetheart.

20:21.115 --> 20:22.414
There's no bears in this forest.

20:22.450 --> 20:23.694
Actually I read
that there are bears

20:23.718 --> 20:26.051
and foxes and wolves in here.

20:27.722 --> 20:29.255
But, you know,

20:29.290 --> 20:30.767
I read the wrong thing
all the time, so.

20:30.791 --> 20:32.191
Daddy, I'm so scared.

20:32.226 --> 20:34.404
No, it's okay,
there's nothing to be scared of.

20:34.428 --> 20:37.429
- The bears are hibernating.
- But we're so far from the hotel.

20:37.465 --> 20:40.566
I bet you've seen
The Wizard of Oz, right?

20:41.636 --> 20:44.536
- It's one of my favourites.
- Me too.

20:44.572 --> 20:45.905
What do Dorothy
and her friends do

20:45.940 --> 20:47.417
when they're scared
walking in the forest?

20:47.441 --> 20:49.642
They sing?

20:49.677 --> 20:53.145
Exactly, so why don't we
sing our way back to the hotel?

20:53.180 --> 20:57.116
- I sang in the school choir.
- That's perfect!

20:57.151 --> 20:59.318
What are you singing right now?

20:59.353 --> 21:00.831
"She'll be Comin'
Round the Mountain".

21:00.855 --> 21:02.254
I know that one.

21:02.290 --> 21:05.557
- Here, let me take your skis.
- Thank you.

21:05.593 --> 21:07.393
Take it away!

21:07.428 --> 21:09.561
<i>She'll be comin' round
the mountain when she comes</i>

21:09.597 --> 21:11.330
<i>Toot, toot.</i>

21:11.365 --> 21:13.966
<i>She'll be comin' round
the mountain when she comes</i>

21:14.001 --> 21:15.267
<i>Toot, toot!</i>

21:15.303 --> 21:17.169
<i>Come on, Cowardly Lion!
Sing with us!</i>

21:17.204 --> 21:18.604
<i>I'm not afraid.</i>

21:18.639 --> 21:21.907
<i>Of wolves or the singing?</i>

21:21.943 --> 21:24.944
<i>She'll be driving six
white horses when she comes</i>

21:24.979 --> 21:26.645
<i>Whoa, back!</i>

21:26.681 --> 21:28.647
<i>She'll be driving six
white horses when she comes</i>

21:28.683 --> 21:30.149
<i>Whoa, back!</i>

21:30.184 --> 21:31.595
<i>She'll be driving
six white horses...</i>

21:31.619 --> 21:33.285
<i>She'll be driving
six white horses</i>

21:33.321 --> 21:35.921
<i>She'll be driving six
white horses when she comes</i>

21:41.162 --> 21:42.639
Look, you know
you have to talk to Craig

21:42.663 --> 21:43.840
and see how serious it is
with Lana.

21:43.864 --> 21:46.265
He invited her to a wedding.

21:46.300 --> 21:48.000
It seems pretty
straightforward to me.

21:48.035 --> 21:50.035
No. Nothing is straightforward
in any relationship.

21:50.071 --> 21:52.604
- You need to dig a little deeper.
- How?

21:52.640 --> 21:54.673
Ask questions,
the right questions.

21:54.709 --> 21:58.711
Ask the right questions.
Right, right, right.

21:58.746 --> 22:00.479
That was so much fun!

22:00.514 --> 22:02.448
And snowshoeing,
it wasn't hard at all!

22:02.483 --> 22:06.518
And look...
we made it back safe and sound.

22:06.554 --> 22:08.721
Do you really think
those tracks are bunny tracks?

22:08.756 --> 22:10.622
I think so but I'm not sure.

22:10.658 --> 22:12.636
You know what? With that picture
your dad took on his phone

22:12.660 --> 22:14.338
I think you could ask
somebody here at the hotel.

22:14.362 --> 22:16.695
You know who would know?
Peter, the concierge.

22:16.731 --> 22:18.063
Can I, Daddy?

22:18.099 --> 22:19.965
Okay, you take this in,
ask Peter,

22:20.001 --> 22:21.700
and I'm gonna return
your snowshoes, okay?

22:21.736 --> 22:23.135
- Thank you.
- All right.

22:23.170 --> 22:25.637
- See ya later.
- Bye!

22:25.673 --> 22:28.173
Well, thank you for saving me.

22:28.209 --> 22:29.686
And I'm so sorry
about the bear thing.

22:29.710 --> 22:31.310
It's okay.

22:31.345 --> 22:32.889
And actually, this turned out
to be a lot of fun.

22:32.913 --> 22:34.680
Yeah, it did.

22:34.715 --> 22:37.349
How come Lana didn't come?

22:37.385 --> 22:40.652
Lana booked herself
a sauna and a massage.

22:40.688 --> 22:42.332
I don't think she's enjoying
this winter weather

22:42.356 --> 22:44.089
as much as
she thought she would.

22:44.125 --> 22:47.159
- It's not for everybody.
- I love it, though.

22:47.194 --> 22:49.061
Especially after
a fresh snowfall.

22:49.096 --> 22:50.929
When the snow is still
sitting on the branches

22:50.965 --> 22:53.198
and everything
is white and magical.

22:53.234 --> 22:55.267
You know what they say,
it's not the circumstances

22:55.302 --> 22:57.202
that create the joy-it's you.

22:57.238 --> 22:59.004
That's so true.

23:00.574 --> 23:02.775
Okay, well I,
I'm gonna go check on Sara,

23:02.810 --> 23:04.388
make sure she found out
her mystery tracks.

23:04.412 --> 23:06.278
Yeah. Good luck.
You want these?

23:06.313 --> 23:07.913
Here, yeah, I'll trade ya.

23:07.948 --> 23:09.515
- Okay. Got it.
- Got that?

23:10.918 --> 23:13.185
Got 'em.
'Kay. All right.

23:13.220 --> 23:14.553
- We'll see ya.
- Bye!

23:14.588 --> 23:17.156
Bye.

23:18.259 --> 23:19.425
- Jenny!
- Hi!

23:19.460 --> 23:20.771
- Did you find the veil?
- No luck.

23:20.795 --> 23:22.628
It's okay.
Who needs a veil anyway?

23:22.663 --> 23:24.897
It's not like I wanted my day
to be perfect or anything.

23:24.932 --> 23:27.132
- Right.
- I'm panicking.

23:27.168 --> 23:29.868
No, no. No, you're not.
And you know what?

23:29.904 --> 23:30.981
It's fine, don't worry about it.

23:31.005 --> 23:33.972
As your maid of honour,
it is my job to figure it out, okay?

23:34.008 --> 23:35.140
Okay.

23:35.176 --> 23:36.809
And it's actually fine
if you don't.

23:36.844 --> 23:40.646
Everything actually is perfect.
Except for that whole Craig thing.

23:40.681 --> 23:42.915
By the way, I booked us
a pre-wedding manicure

23:42.950 --> 23:44.416
- at the local spa.
- When?

23:44.452 --> 23:46.552
- In an hour.
- Okay, well,

23:46.587 --> 23:48.098
I better go get these
dropped off then.

23:48.122 --> 23:50.122
- See ya.
- See ya.

23:53.393 --> 23:56.361
Okay, maybe I'll get my nails
done in red for love.

23:56.396 --> 23:59.164
Hi, ladies!
So sorry I'm late.

23:59.199 --> 24:01.210
The concierge just gave me
the message. I was in the sauna.

24:01.234 --> 24:03.001
I am so happy
that you invited me!

24:03.036 --> 24:06.204
- I'm so happy you could come.
- I am so happy too!

24:06.239 --> 24:09.074
My nails are a disaster.

24:09.109 --> 24:10.442
Lana!

24:10.477 --> 24:12.410
How long have you and Craig
known one another?

24:12.446 --> 24:14.179
About three years now.

24:14.214 --> 24:15.747
So you knew him
when he was married.

24:15.782 --> 24:18.349
Yes, I was really good friends
with his wife.

24:19.653 --> 24:20.919
After she passed I made a point

24:20.954 --> 24:23.755
of checking in
on Craig and Sara,

24:23.790 --> 24:25.857
bringing them food,
that kinda thing.

24:25.892 --> 24:27.225
That was thoughtful.

24:27.260 --> 24:28.571
It was only
the right thing to do.

24:28.595 --> 24:31.930
And after a while I would stay for dinner,
take Sara shopping for clothes.

24:31.965 --> 24:35.033
Sounds like you were
really there for them.

24:35.068 --> 24:37.602
Well, it's not a chore when
you really care about somebody.

24:37.637 --> 24:40.071
So, do you see yourself
in my shoes one day?

24:40.107 --> 24:42.741
- You know, making it official?
- I think so.

24:42.776 --> 24:44.142
He hasn't asked yet,

24:44.177 --> 24:47.378
but I have no doubt
in my mind that he will.

24:47.414 --> 24:49.714
Afterward we're gonna go on
a quick tour of the town

24:49.750 --> 24:51.449
if you have time.

24:51.485 --> 24:53.118
That sounds so lovely!

24:53.153 --> 24:54.597
I've been away
from Craig and Sara all day.

24:54.621 --> 24:56.554
It's just been me,
me, me, me, me.

24:56.590 --> 24:59.958
So I think I probably should get
back, but I'm gonna get a colour.

25:03.263 --> 25:04.496
Okay, what's going on?

25:04.531 --> 25:05.930
- What are you guys doing?
- What?

25:05.966 --> 25:07.432
I can tell when
you guys are digging!

25:07.467 --> 25:09.167
Listen, we just need
to get the scoop.

25:09.202 --> 25:11.180
Okay, well clearly they're in
a very solid relationship.

25:11.204 --> 25:13.571
- Well, I wouldn't say that.
- Meg!

25:13.607 --> 25:15.607
I'd say he's not sure.

25:15.642 --> 25:17.820
She might be misunderstanding
the relationship. It can happen.

25:17.844 --> 25:20.445
People start as friends,

25:20.480 --> 25:22.413
- ... get comfortable and then...
- Mom, Mom.

25:22.449 --> 25:25.116
Meg, I need you both
to back off, okay?

25:25.152 --> 25:26.684
He is taken.

25:26.720 --> 25:28.753
And there's no way
I'm getting in between that.

25:28.789 --> 25:30.221
I found one!

25:32.125 --> 25:34.192
You think we can do that
again sometime?

25:34.227 --> 25:36.828
Hang out with Jenny.
I like her. She's fun.

25:39.900 --> 25:42.300
She is full of life, isn't she?

25:42.335 --> 25:45.270
You're definitely
more fun around her.

25:45.305 --> 25:48.273
- How so?
- Like today, you were singing.

25:48.308 --> 25:51.209
Well,
you've heard me sing before.

25:51.244 --> 25:53.711
It's the first time
since Mom passed.

25:53.747 --> 25:55.213
Knock, knock!

25:55.248 --> 25:59.317
I just wanted
to check in on you two,

25:59.352 --> 26:00.685
see how you're doin'.

26:00.720 --> 26:02.387
Here.
Let me finish that.

26:02.422 --> 26:05.323
- How was your sauna?
- It was great!

26:05.358 --> 26:07.725
And then the girls asked me
to join them for a manicure.

26:07.761 --> 26:09.561
- Was Jenny there?
- She was!

26:09.596 --> 26:11.229
I wish I could've gone!

26:11.264 --> 26:13.898
I didn't realize
that you knew Jenny.

26:13.934 --> 26:16.067
We ran into her
while we were snowshoeing.

26:16.102 --> 26:19.871
She was a bit lost,
so we all came back together.

26:19.906 --> 26:22.640
There you go.

26:22.676 --> 26:24.409
Thank you.

26:24.444 --> 26:26.656
Do you think Jenny could finish
telling me her story at dinner?

26:26.680 --> 26:28.546
I actually thought
that the three of us

26:28.582 --> 26:30.381
could get dinner alone.

26:30.417 --> 26:32.383
I saw the most adorable place
in the village...

26:32.419 --> 26:34.485
a pizzeria, and I know
how much you love pizza.

26:34.521 --> 26:37.288
All right.
Let's go!

26:40.427 --> 26:42.827
You sure don't see
stars like this in the city.

26:42.863 --> 26:44.195
Oh, boy. That's for sure.

26:44.231 --> 26:45.241
- Shooting star!
- I saw that.

26:45.265 --> 26:48.867
- Make a wish, make a wish!
- My wish already came true.

26:48.902 --> 26:51.936
Hey, my man!
Where you been?

26:51.972 --> 26:55.073
- We went into town for dinner.
- Yeah, just the three of us.

26:55.108 --> 26:56.875
I got this at the market!

26:56.910 --> 26:58.576
It's so cute.
Do you know if they had any

26:58.612 --> 27:00.678
with tigers on them?
I love tigers.

27:00.714 --> 27:04.382
And did you know that in Taiga
they have the world's biggest tigers?

27:04.417 --> 27:09.120
And the people that live on the land
say that if you respect the tigers,

27:09.155 --> 27:11.956
the tigers
will respect you back.

27:11.992 --> 27:15.894
- That sounds terrifying!
- Really?

27:15.929 --> 27:17.362
That sounds
kinda mystical to me.

27:17.397 --> 27:19.497
I think so too.

27:20.734 --> 27:21.933
Please, join us!

27:21.968 --> 27:23.568
Yeah. The shooting stars
are spectacular.

27:23.603 --> 27:24.802
- You know...
- Come on.

27:24.838 --> 27:26.437
...we should actually go.

27:26.473 --> 27:27.972
Daddy, please?

27:28.008 --> 27:30.742
You know,
the fire looks pretty nice.

27:30.777 --> 27:31.976
There you go.

27:32.012 --> 27:33.278
Look, look!
There's another one.

27:33.313 --> 27:35.046
Everyone make another wish.

27:37.350 --> 27:38.883
Your mom's getting
a little sappy here.

27:38.919 --> 27:42.420
- Hey.
- I'm fine. It's just...

27:42.455 --> 27:44.289
I wish we could always
be together like this,

27:44.324 --> 27:46.457
as a family.

27:46.493 --> 27:49.394
Makes my wish of a motorcycle
seem a little bit selfish.

27:50.830 --> 27:54.632
What about you?
What'd you wish for?

27:54.668 --> 27:58.303
I bet you it was a double patty,
double cheese from Phil's.

27:58.338 --> 27:59.771
Why would you say that?

27:59.806 --> 28:01.239
Actually, I think Tony's wish

28:01.274 --> 28:03.274
is a little more sentimental
than that.

28:03.310 --> 28:06.911
Thank you for the props, bud,
but Meg is right.

28:06.947 --> 28:08.313
- But only because...
- Thank you!

28:08.348 --> 28:11.349
...like her, my wish came true.

28:12.652 --> 28:13.985
I know it sounds mushy

28:14.020 --> 28:16.287
but I wished
for what you and Meg have.

28:18.158 --> 28:20.491
What about you, Craig?
What do you wish for?

28:23.797 --> 28:25.897
I wish for all of Sara's wishes
to come true.

28:27.400 --> 28:30.268
- What did you wish for, Sara?
- I can't say it.

28:30.303 --> 28:31.703
Why not?

28:31.738 --> 28:33.338
If I tell it to you,
it won't come true.

28:33.373 --> 28:35.907
I'm with Sara on that one.

28:39.145 --> 28:40.545
- Are you all right?
- Yeah!

28:40.580 --> 28:43.526
I'm fine!
It's just the cold air and I...

28:43.550 --> 28:48.119
- Maybe you're getting a cold.
- No, I'm fine! I'm fine.

28:49.189 --> 28:51.389
I never get sick.

28:51.424 --> 28:53.891
Whoa, you definitely feel warm.

28:53.927 --> 28:55.626
A good night's sleep

28:55.662 --> 28:58.363
always made my girls feel
right as rain the next day.

28:58.398 --> 29:00.631
Clark and I will walk you
back to your room.

29:02.402 --> 29:04.202
We should go to bed too.

29:04.237 --> 29:06.404
- Come on, we'll take you.
- Okay. Good night.

29:06.439 --> 29:08.539
- Good night, folks.
- Yeah, we'll come to bed too.

29:08.575 --> 29:10.575
- What? It's only nine o'clock!
- Good night!

29:10.610 --> 29:13.511
There's a whole bunch of
snacks waiting for you, Tony.

29:13.546 --> 29:15.581
- Now you're talkin'!
- Yeah, let's go get 'em.

29:15.615 --> 29:16.781
Night!

29:18.352 --> 29:20.685
Jenny, can you finish
telling me the story now?

29:20.720 --> 29:25.590
- I'm sure Jenny has things to do.
- No, no, I'd be happy to.

29:25.625 --> 29:27.536
I mean, if you don't mind
Sara staying up a little longer.

29:27.560 --> 29:32.163
- Please, Daddy?
- Okay.

29:32.198 --> 29:34.432
But you gotta promise
to go to bed right after.

29:34.467 --> 29:36.167
You know what?
I have just the thing

29:36.202 --> 29:38.403
that's gonna ensure

29:38.438 --> 29:40.271
that you will go to sleep
right after.

29:40.306 --> 29:41.973
Here you go.

29:43.610 --> 29:46.577
Warm milk...

29:46.613 --> 29:49.347
with just a touch
of honey and nutmeg.

29:49.382 --> 29:53.051
Guaranteed to send you
into dreamland.

29:56.089 --> 29:57.789
Now, where were we?

29:57.824 --> 29:59.857
Snowball was stuck in the ice
and there was a fin.

29:59.893 --> 30:01.459
Was it a shark?

30:01.494 --> 30:04.062
Well, the fin swam closer
and closer to Snowball,

30:04.097 --> 30:07.899
until the water broke
and out came...

30:07.934 --> 30:09.367
a huge orca whale!

30:11.137 --> 30:13.738
Snowball backed away
from the edge of the ice flow

30:13.773 --> 30:15.206
and begged the whale,

30:15.241 --> 30:17.475
"Please, I'm just trying
to get to my family!"

30:17.510 --> 30:21.112
Then the whale started to push
the ice flow towards shore.

30:21.147 --> 30:24.048
And when he got close enough,
Snowball jumped off

30:24.084 --> 30:27.985
and then from the blizzard
came two giant polar bears.

30:28.021 --> 30:30.054
Who do you think it was?

30:30.090 --> 30:32.390
- His parents?
- Yes!

30:32.425 --> 30:36.427
Snowball ran towards them
and the father thanked the whale.

30:36.463 --> 30:42.066
And then, the water broke again
with an entire pod of orca whales!

30:42.102 --> 30:44.302
Snowball waved,
"Thank you and goodbye!"

30:44.337 --> 30:47.972
and he set off with his parents,
safe and sound.

30:48.007 --> 30:49.474
The end.

30:49.509 --> 30:52.143
- So the whales were his family.
- That's right!

30:52.178 --> 30:53.778
And they knew
the importance of family

30:53.813 --> 30:56.314
so that's why they wanted
to get Snowball back to his.

30:58.685 --> 30:59.851
You...

30:59.886 --> 31:01.652
you really are
a great storyteller.

31:01.688 --> 31:03.754
Thank you.

31:03.790 --> 31:07.792
You must be a writer
or something creative like that.

31:07.827 --> 31:11.429
Well, if you call a children's
storybook editor creative,

31:11.464 --> 31:13.798
then sure, yeah.

31:13.833 --> 31:16.601
But it's not really
my dream job.

31:18.204 --> 31:19.470
What about you?
What do you do?

31:19.506 --> 31:22.273
I'm the director
of a travel company.

31:22.308 --> 31:24.675
- That is exciting.
- Well.

31:26.212 --> 31:27.612
So what's stopping you?

31:27.647 --> 31:29.313
From what?

31:29.349 --> 31:30.848
I mean, you're the one
that told me

31:30.884 --> 31:33.784
the more I say no to,
the more I miss out on.

31:33.820 --> 31:37.355
And clearly, you have a gift.

31:37.390 --> 31:40.892
Well, honestly I thought that,

31:40.927 --> 31:42.693
if I was just like
an editor for a few years,

31:42.729 --> 31:45.129
maybe I'd get my shot
at being a writer.

31:47.400 --> 31:49.534
Hasn't exactly
worked out as planned.

31:51.271 --> 31:53.070
That along with
a few other things.

31:53.106 --> 31:55.573
Like what?

31:55.608 --> 31:58.409
Well, I always really wanted
to see New Zealand

31:58.444 --> 32:00.511
- ... before life got too busy.
- Really?

32:00.547 --> 32:01.891
You know, actually,
I've always wanted

32:01.915 --> 32:03.347
to see New Zealand myself.

32:03.383 --> 32:06.484
Although you did make
a very good pitch for Taiga.

32:08.054 --> 32:11.088
You know what? I am actually
writing a story right now.

32:11.124 --> 32:12.723
It's kind of
inspired by the hotel.

32:12.759 --> 32:15.226
So you never know, maybe
this is gonna be my big shot.

32:15.261 --> 32:17.361
You know, I think it will.

32:17.397 --> 32:20.731
Because if dreams do come true,

32:20.767 --> 32:23.367
I imagine they
have to come true here.

32:30.977 --> 32:33.778
Looks like your
sleeping potion's working.

32:33.813 --> 32:35.446
Never fails.

32:35.481 --> 32:38.316
- I think we should get to bed.
- Of course.

32:40.820 --> 32:42.220
Come here, you.

32:45.391 --> 32:47.258
We should head back
to the shuttle.

32:47.293 --> 32:49.060
Yeah. Let's do it.

32:58.404 --> 33:01.906
<i>As the shooting stars
streaked across the sky,</i>

33:01.941 --> 33:04.909
<i>each one encapsulating
the promise of someone,</i>

33:04.944 --> 33:07.912
<i>somewhere,
realizing a lifelong dream.</i>

33:36.476 --> 33:41.446
I wish I may, I wish I might...

33:41.481 --> 33:43.448
have this wish I wish tonight.

33:45.118 --> 33:47.752
My happily ever after.

33:58.815 --> 34:02.202
How'd it go last night?
You know, after we all left.

34:02.237 --> 34:03.770
It was...

34:03.806 --> 34:06.106
it was nice.
It was nice, yeah.

34:06.141 --> 34:08.742
I mean, I finished
a story for Sara and...

34:08.777 --> 34:11.244
she fell asleep on me.

34:12.614 --> 34:15.415
Of course she did.
Your stories are like magic.

34:15.451 --> 34:17.951
You don't just write well for kids.
You're great with them.

34:19.021 --> 34:22.755
Yeah.
So is Lana.

34:23.826 --> 34:25.125
It's work.

34:25.159 --> 34:26.170
I'm so sorry, I have to...

34:26.195 --> 34:28.161
- Stay, stay.
- Okay.

34:30.130 --> 34:31.731
Hey, Ed!
How's it shakin' over there?

34:31.766 --> 34:33.299
<i>It's shakin' all right.</i>

34:33.335 --> 34:35.235
<i>How's it goin' there?
Having fun?</i>

34:35.270 --> 34:37.337
Ed, I wish you could
see this place. It is magic

34:37.371 --> 34:38.670
<i>and there is so much to do.</i>

34:38.706 --> 34:40.016
<i>Today, for example, I'm gonna go</i>

34:40.041 --> 34:42.842
<i>in a ride
on a horse-drawn carriage!</i>

34:42.877 --> 34:47.580
- By yourself?
- Yeah. By myself, why?

34:47.616 --> 34:49.849
<i>It just sounds like
the kinda thing you'd do with,</i>

34:49.884 --> 34:51.251
<i>I don't know, someone else.</i>

34:51.286 --> 34:54.254
Well...

34:54.289 --> 34:56.822
there's this guy...

34:56.858 --> 34:58.524
his name's Craig.

34:58.560 --> 35:01.628
And he's the best man
and he is super nice

35:01.663 --> 35:03.174
and he has a daughter,
her name's Sara.

35:03.198 --> 35:04.631
<i>She is so sweet.</i>

35:04.666 --> 35:07.100
And I think she really
likes my stories

35:07.135 --> 35:08.512
and I really like
both of them, but...

35:08.536 --> 35:11.804
<i>What?
What's the problem?</i>

35:11.840 --> 35:14.340
I don't really know
where he's at.

35:14.376 --> 35:17.310
You know, like,
with somebody else?

35:17.345 --> 35:18.711
<i>So it's complicated.</i>

35:18.747 --> 35:20.647
It sure it.

35:20.682 --> 35:22.615
But you know what?
I'm keeping myself busy.

35:22.651 --> 35:25.718
<i>- I'm actually writing a story!
- Actually, that's why I called.</i>

35:25.754 --> 35:28.054
One of the books Carrie's
waiting on from another writer

35:28.089 --> 35:29.489
is coming in late,

35:29.524 --> 35:31.057
so she wants to put out
something ASAP.

35:31.092 --> 35:32.792
<i>You should send it in.</i>

35:34.029 --> 35:35.828
Ed, my story's not ready.

35:35.864 --> 35:37.308
You don't want to
miss the boat on this one.

35:37.332 --> 35:38.342
Just send in what you've got.

35:38.366 --> 35:41.034
Okay, yeah! No, I can...
I... I'm on it.

35:41.069 --> 35:42.368
Ed, thank you for the heads up.

35:42.404 --> 35:44.003
<i>Okay. Have fun.</i>

35:44.039 --> 35:45.519
<i>Oh... keep me posted
on the best man.</i>

35:45.740 --> 35:47.907
Okay.

35:47.942 --> 35:49.308
Meg, I'm so sorry.
I have to go.

35:49.343 --> 35:51.722
I have to email something but
I'll meet you back here later?

35:51.746 --> 35:53.245
Cool, yeah. Go.
Have fun.

35:53.281 --> 35:54.413
- Okay, thanks.
- Have fun.

35:56.417 --> 35:57.983
I'm so sorry.

35:58.019 --> 36:01.754
- Hey! Are you okay?
- I'm fine!

36:01.789 --> 36:03.789
I just have a stuffy nose.

36:03.825 --> 36:05.758
Well do you want me
to get you anything?

36:05.793 --> 36:08.861
- Do you want some tea or...?
- Vitamin D, buffered C.

36:11.866 --> 36:15.501
I'll be...
I'll be fine.

36:15.536 --> 36:16.702
Okay.

36:37.024 --> 36:39.959
You are so beautiful.

36:39.994 --> 36:41.427
Hey!

36:41.462 --> 36:43.496
Hey.

36:43.531 --> 36:45.765
Are you going on the...
on the carriage ride?

36:45.800 --> 36:48.968
I mean,
how could I say no?

36:49.003 --> 36:50.669
Where's Sara?

36:50.705 --> 36:53.639
She's dog sledding
with Meg and Tony.

36:53.674 --> 36:56.375
That sounds like so much fun.

36:56.410 --> 36:58.944
You really have
an adventurous spirit.

36:58.980 --> 37:00.324
You should consider
travel writing.

37:00.348 --> 37:03.983
Well, if you need a writer,
I'm...

37:04.018 --> 37:05.050
very much available.

37:05.086 --> 37:07.553
I'll remember that.

37:07.588 --> 37:10.055
So what is your name, I wonder?

37:10.091 --> 37:13.959
The owner told me
that this is King Richard.

37:13.995 --> 37:15.294
That's very regal.

37:16.697 --> 37:18.798
A horse, a horse!
My kingdom for a horse!

37:18.833 --> 37:23.002
- Shakespeare.
- Yeah, Richard III.

37:25.573 --> 37:29.074
How is... how is Lana?

37:29.110 --> 37:30.976
I saw her this morning
and she didn't seem

37:31.012 --> 37:32.912
quite right as rain.
Yeah.

37:32.947 --> 37:35.714
I doubt we'll see Lana
racing through the snow today.

37:35.750 --> 37:38.551
You two...
two together?

37:38.586 --> 37:40.085
- Are we to... No, no.
- Togeth...

37:40.121 --> 37:41.598
- We're not.
- No, no, no, we're not together.

37:41.622 --> 37:42.833
I mean, like, he's the best man

37:42.857 --> 37:45.257
- and I'm the best...
- Maid of honour.

37:45.293 --> 37:47.693
I'm the best wo...
That's how we're together.

37:47.728 --> 37:50.729
All I need to know
is if you're riding together.

37:53.734 --> 37:55.012
I mean, I don't mind
if you don't mind.

37:55.036 --> 37:58.337
Of course.
Not! Of course not.

37:58.372 --> 38:01.340
- No, yeah, we'll...
- Okay. Great!

38:01.375 --> 38:02.808
Ride together.

38:04.712 --> 38:05.911
Thank you.

38:08.216 --> 38:09.248
Thanks.

38:11.619 --> 38:15.020
- All right, we're off!
- I...

38:15.056 --> 38:17.089
I got these pastries
at a bakery in town.

38:17.124 --> 38:19.625
Do you... you want one?

38:19.660 --> 38:21.093
Yes.

38:24.799 --> 38:26.332
Thank you.

38:37.178 --> 38:38.277
This is the best.

38:40.014 --> 38:41.614
What, the pastry?

38:41.649 --> 38:44.084
- Yeah, that.
- Yeah.

38:44.118 --> 38:46.285
And being here.

38:47.788 --> 38:49.722
With my family and...

38:49.757 --> 38:51.557
seeing my sister get married.

38:53.261 --> 38:55.501
I mean, I just don't know
what could be better than that.

38:56.864 --> 39:00.733
- Is Sara having fun?
- She is having a blast.

39:00.768 --> 39:03.636
And she's got that same
adventurous spirit that you do.

39:05.306 --> 39:06.906
She was a really big part

39:06.941 --> 39:09.074
of helping me get through
the first few years.

39:12.446 --> 39:17.349
You know, I'm a pretty good
judge of character and...

39:17.385 --> 39:19.451
I think she gets
that spirit from you.

39:22.790 --> 39:25.791
That and Meg said
you were a real go getter.

39:25.826 --> 39:27.526
Really?

39:28.729 --> 39:31.497
What else did Meg say about me?

39:31.532 --> 39:33.866
Well, nothing.

39:33.901 --> 39:35.545
You know, we were just
talking about wedding...

39:35.569 --> 39:37.481
you know, like seating
and guests and wedding stuff.

39:37.505 --> 39:39.104
Yeah, yeah.
You know that's funny,

39:39.140 --> 39:42.274
because when I called to see
if it was okay to bring Sara,

39:42.310 --> 39:45.010
she mentioned you as well.

39:45.046 --> 39:47.479
That is funny.
What did she say about me?

39:47.515 --> 39:50.249
How well she thought
that we would get along.

39:52.019 --> 39:56.689
I gotta say I,
I think she was right.

40:01.329 --> 40:02.895
I mean, just look
at this village.

40:02.930 --> 40:05.798
It almost feels
like we're in a Dickens play!

40:05.833 --> 40:07.866
You have this way
of putting everything

40:07.902 --> 40:10.002
like it came right out
of a storybook.

40:12.506 --> 40:15.341
- Well, this was fun.
- Yeah!

40:15.376 --> 40:18.043
- Thank you so much for the pastry.
- Don't worry about it.

40:18.079 --> 40:19.144
Amazing.

40:21.415 --> 40:23.382
Thank you so much.

40:26.454 --> 40:29.054
All right.

40:34.529 --> 40:37.130
I can't believe how nice
everyone in this town is!

40:37.165 --> 40:38.865
Yeah, it's crazy.

40:38.901 --> 40:40.345
- Yeah, they're really lovely.
- I know!

40:40.369 --> 40:41.468
Hi!

40:41.503 --> 40:43.870
- So, how was it?
- It was amazing.

40:43.906 --> 40:45.316
It was like something
out of a fairy tale.

40:45.340 --> 40:47.340
The town is just steeped
in such history.

40:47.376 --> 40:48.875
It's so quaint!
It's so lovely.

40:48.911 --> 40:50.744
Now I'm looking forward
to our ride even more.

40:50.779 --> 40:52.691
Is it okay
if we take Sara with us?

40:52.715 --> 40:54.192
That's perfect!
I'm supposed to go meet Tony

40:54.216 --> 40:55.549
to talk about
some wedding stuff.

40:55.584 --> 40:57.684
I have to meet Megan
for her vows.

40:57.720 --> 41:00.253
I'm sure you could just drop her
back off here when you're done.

41:00.289 --> 41:01.955
Great.

41:01.991 --> 41:04.925
- All right. I'll see you later.
- Yeah, see you later.

41:04.960 --> 41:06.237
All right, cool.
Okay. Bye, guys.

41:06.261 --> 41:07.327
Bye, guys.

41:11.734 --> 41:12.766
Craig!

41:12.801 --> 41:13.801
- Lana!
- Hi!

41:13.836 --> 41:16.436
- Hey! How you feelin'?
- Like a whole new woman.

41:16.472 --> 41:19.773
A little vitamin C and some time
under my sun lamp and I'm good to go!

41:19.808 --> 41:22.409
- Where's Sara?
- She's with Linda and Clark.

41:22.444 --> 41:23.744
They went for a sleigh ride.

41:23.779 --> 41:26.613
So I guess
it's just you and me then.

41:26.649 --> 41:28.215
Yeah.

41:28.250 --> 41:30.283
I'm supposed to meet Tony
about some stuff.

41:30.319 --> 41:31.896
I was hoping Sara could
come hang out with you

41:31.920 --> 41:33.286
if I didn't get back in time

41:33.322 --> 41:34.633
and then we could all
meet up together.

41:34.657 --> 41:37.002
- We?
- Yeah, like the wedding party.

41:37.026 --> 41:38.558
Okay.

41:38.594 --> 41:40.138
Yeah, I guess a few
more hours under the lamp

41:40.162 --> 41:41.928
couldn't hurt
while I wait for Sara.

41:41.964 --> 41:43.563
Great.

41:49.838 --> 41:55.175
- Okay. Read me what you got.
- My dear Anthony...

41:55.210 --> 41:56.576
Keep going.

41:56.612 --> 41:58.512
- That's all I have.
- What?

41:58.547 --> 41:59.913
I know, it's terrible.

41:59.948 --> 42:01.581
But it doesn't mean
that I don't love him

42:01.617 --> 42:03.150
in a million different ways.

42:03.185 --> 42:06.353
It's just that I'm not good
at this whole writing thing.

42:06.388 --> 42:09.356
- That's your forte.
- Okay, well we can do this.

42:09.391 --> 42:13.293
Why don't you just tell me
everything you love about Anthony?

42:13.328 --> 42:16.096
He always makes me smile
when I'm feeling down.

42:16.131 --> 42:18.131
That's nice.

42:18.167 --> 42:21.968
And he levels me out
when I'm feeling crazy,

42:22.004 --> 42:23.937
even though he does
actually drive me crazy.

42:25.541 --> 42:27.941
Because he's my best friend.

42:27.976 --> 42:29.376
Well, why don't you
just write down

42:29.411 --> 42:30.777
everything you just told me

42:30.813 --> 42:32.157
and then I'll just
arrange it for you?

42:32.181 --> 42:34.347
Jen, if you would do that,

42:34.383 --> 42:36.483
you would be the best sister
and maid of honour ever!

42:36.518 --> 42:39.986
- Of course.
- Thank you.

42:40.022 --> 42:43.123
- Okay, now what about you?
- What about me?

42:43.158 --> 42:44.491
Fine.

42:44.526 --> 42:46.960
It's always awesome hanging
out with him and his daughter

42:46.995 --> 42:50.630
but it's not gonna happen.
He's with Lana.

42:52.668 --> 42:53.668
Look.

42:53.702 --> 42:56.970
Tony's with Craig right now,
going through wedding details.

42:57.005 --> 42:59.072
I told Tony he has to
come back with answers

42:59.108 --> 43:00.474
about Craig and Lana.

43:00.509 --> 43:01.920
They're guys.
They don't know how to talk

43:01.944 --> 43:04.411
and besides,
did you not hear Lana's wish?

43:04.446 --> 43:08.548
I also heard Craig's wish
and it had nothing to do with Lana's.

43:08.584 --> 43:13.487
- Besides, what about your wish?
- Meg... I'm a big girl.

43:13.522 --> 43:16.990
And I refuse to stand
in the way of a woman

43:17.025 --> 43:20.093
who obviously deserves
to have her wish come true.

43:26.135 --> 43:28.101
You know what you're doing
for the wedding?

43:28.137 --> 43:32.038
- Yeah, showing up, right?
- Pretty much.

43:32.074 --> 43:33.507
I think we got this...

43:35.477 --> 43:37.544
That's too bad.

43:37.579 --> 43:41.014
Hey, when you and Meg
were making the guest list

43:41.049 --> 43:43.316
did you,
you mention me to Jenny?

43:44.586 --> 43:46.186
I didn't make the guest list,
man.

43:46.221 --> 43:49.856
Right.
Well when Meg was making it,

43:49.892 --> 43:53.026
you think she was trying
to set us up?

43:53.061 --> 43:55.395
I wouldn't know
anything about that.

43:55.430 --> 43:57.575
But then again, I didn't really
know about Lana either.

43:57.599 --> 43:59.065
Yeah.

43:59.101 --> 44:00.612
And you shoulda talked
to Meg about that

44:00.636 --> 44:02.102
'cause she was making
the guest list

44:02.137 --> 44:03.737
and whoa did I almost
screw that one up.

44:03.772 --> 44:06.740
I'm sorry about that, okay?
It was my bad.

44:06.775 --> 44:10.477
Just... when Lana saw the
invitation, she got so excited.

44:10.512 --> 44:12.712
And she really has done
so much for us.

44:12.748 --> 44:16.550
- I figured I should invite her.
- Right.

44:16.585 --> 44:19.119
So...
You and Lana are... are what?

44:20.255 --> 44:21.388
Oh, come on!

44:21.423 --> 44:22.889
- Look at that!
- Really?

44:22.925 --> 44:24.224
That's game.

44:24.259 --> 44:25.659
Wanna play another one?

44:25.694 --> 44:27.961
Unbelievable. Yeah, I do.
That last shot was a fluke.

44:27.996 --> 44:30.630
- You kiddin' me? That was skill!
- Skill? Yeah, right.

44:30.666 --> 44:33.567
- Wanna bet?
- You're on, buddy.

44:37.206 --> 44:39.072
You're really getting
the hang of that.

44:39.107 --> 44:40.507
Jenny!

44:40.542 --> 44:42.187
- I've gone about ten times already.
- What?

44:42.211 --> 44:43.922
- Come on! This time we can go together.
- All right!

44:43.946 --> 44:45.312
See ya!

44:45.347 --> 44:47.848
Where are those two off to?

44:47.883 --> 44:50.617
To the top
of the slide or something.

44:50.652 --> 44:52.330
- Do you wanna go together on this one?
- Yeah.

44:52.354 --> 44:55.188
So did you finish all
the wedding planning stuff?

44:55.224 --> 44:56.990
Yep, got it all done.

44:58.894 --> 45:00.227
All right. Let's do it!

45:04.633 --> 45:07.000
It's so fast!

45:08.804 --> 45:11.438
Oh, man.
That gets better every time!

45:11.473 --> 45:12.639
I told you!

45:12.674 --> 45:14.007
- Again?
- Yes.

45:14.042 --> 45:16.343
- Meg?
- No! I don't wanna get an ice burn

45:16.378 --> 45:17.378
before my wedding!

45:17.412 --> 45:19.980
- I'll give it a try!
- Of course! Come on!

45:20.983 --> 45:22.983
All righty.

45:24.853 --> 45:26.364
We're gonna have to show Lana
how we do it.

45:26.388 --> 45:27.587
- Yeah.
- Right?

45:29.992 --> 45:31.725
Okay.

45:31.760 --> 45:32.993
One more time.

45:41.169 --> 45:44.070
- That was faster than last time.
- I know!

45:44.106 --> 45:45.572
All right, she's comin'.

45:53.749 --> 45:55.415
Lana!
Are you okay?

45:55.450 --> 45:57.417
- Yes.
- Here.

45:57.452 --> 45:59.219
Yeah, I'm fine. I just...
I think...!

45:59.254 --> 46:02.188
- I just hurt my ankle a little bit.
- Well here, just take my hand.

46:03.592 --> 46:04.658
Thank you.
Yeah.

46:07.429 --> 46:08.828
Let's get her sitting.

46:10.299 --> 46:14.668
- Lana, are you gonna be okay?
- It's fine. It's just a little sprain.

46:14.703 --> 46:17.437
- Can you grab me that blanket?
- Yeah, of course.

46:17.472 --> 46:20.740
- Thank you.
- Perfect.

46:20.776 --> 46:22.943
Here's something
to get us settled in.

46:22.978 --> 46:24.511
Thank you.

46:24.546 --> 46:25.845
There you go.

46:25.881 --> 46:27.013
Thank you.

46:28.283 --> 46:29.416
Cheers.

46:30.485 --> 46:32.285
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

46:32.321 --> 46:34.854
This is nice tonight,
with the music?

46:34.890 --> 46:36.222
You know what, we should see

46:36.258 --> 46:37.891
if he would play for us
at the reception.

46:37.926 --> 46:40.694
That's a good idea.

46:42.831 --> 46:45.332
I love this old song!

46:46.768 --> 46:48.568
Me?

46:53.842 --> 46:56.276
Thank you.

48:19.394 --> 48:22.695
Lana!
You've got such a great voice!

48:22.731 --> 48:24.164
Thank you!

48:24.199 --> 48:26.566
It's all those years
singing in my church choir

48:26.601 --> 48:28.234
when I was Sara's age.

48:28.270 --> 48:31.738
- I had no idea!
- You should sing at the wedding!

48:31.773 --> 48:33.653
Oh, no, no. Oh, my gosh.
You're making me blush.

48:35.010 --> 48:38.011
I think we should get to bed.
Come on.

48:38.046 --> 48:39.712
I think I should
hit the hay too.

48:41.249 --> 48:42.782
Good night, Jenny!

48:44.052 --> 48:45.318
Jenny, are you...

48:45.353 --> 48:48.388
Oh, no. I think I'm gonna just
listen to a little more music.

48:48.423 --> 48:50.390
- Night.
- Night.

48:54.262 --> 48:55.528
You have a lovely family.

48:55.564 --> 48:57.831
Yeah, I do.

48:57.866 --> 48:59.999
Is Ms. Devero
part of the family too?

49:00.035 --> 49:01.167
Oh, no.

49:01.203 --> 49:03.336
No, no.
She's just a guest.

49:04.906 --> 49:06.184
Well, I should see
to a few things.

49:06.208 --> 49:07.208
Okay.

49:07.242 --> 49:10.276
Sure.

49:10.312 --> 49:11.744
So should I.

49:21.156 --> 49:22.889
Hi, Ed!
What are you up to?

49:22.924 --> 49:25.225
<i>Just got back
from some shopping.</i>

49:25.260 --> 49:26.793
<i>I bought this for Sam.</i>

49:26.828 --> 49:28.561
It's beautiful.

49:28.597 --> 49:30.096
<i>Not too soon?</i>

49:30.132 --> 49:31.709
<i>I mean, I know
it's not a ring or anything,</i>

49:31.733 --> 49:33.299
<i>but who knows?</i>

49:33.335 --> 49:35.101
<i>If everything goes well,
maybe next year.</i>

49:35.137 --> 49:39.072
Hey, do you know if Carrie's
had a chance to read my story?

49:39.107 --> 49:40.540
<i>I haven't heard anything yet</i>

49:40.575 --> 49:41.953
<i>but she's making
her decision tomorrow.</i>

49:41.977 --> 49:43.087
<i>I'll be sure to put in
a good word.</i>

49:43.111 --> 49:46.279
Thank you, Ed.
You're the best.

49:46.314 --> 49:48.448
<i>Hey, speaking of "best",
how's the best man?</i>

49:51.152 --> 49:52.885
Well, you were right.

49:52.921 --> 49:56.355
It is better to go on
a carriage ride with someone.

49:56.391 --> 49:59.103
Like him. But, I don't know.
I don't know.

49:59.127 --> 50:02.061
<i>- Still complicated?
- Yep.</i>

50:03.131 --> 50:04.931
<i>Hey. I gotta go,</i>

50:04.966 --> 50:06.566
<i>but message me later
with the details.</i>

50:06.601 --> 50:08.501
Yeah, you bet.

50:27.655 --> 50:30.423
I wish Jenny was here
to tell me a story.

50:30.458 --> 50:33.159
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

50:33.194 --> 50:35.761
Well, I'll tell you what.

50:35.797 --> 50:39.999
Why don't I start a story
and then you help me out?

50:40.034 --> 50:42.235
- Okay.
- Okay?

50:44.038 --> 50:47.273
Once upon a time,
there was a prince.

50:47.308 --> 50:51.277
And he lived in a castle
in the middle of a forest.

50:51.312 --> 50:52.312
Your turn.

50:52.347 --> 50:54.947
He had lots of friends,

50:54.983 --> 50:57.583
especially a little rabbit
named Sara.

50:57.619 --> 50:58.751
But he was still lonely.

51:00.188 --> 51:03.189
- Dad, your turn.
- Okay.

51:03.224 --> 51:07.426
And even though
this rabbit meant the world to him,

51:07.462 --> 51:10.596
he was missing something
in his life.

51:10.632 --> 51:12.098
A dog, maybe?

51:12.133 --> 51:14.800
No, Dad!
A princess, of course!

51:14.836 --> 51:16.102
Of course.

51:16.137 --> 51:20.006
So he and the little rabbit
took a trip to the North Pole,

51:20.041 --> 51:21.908
and found a castle
made from ice.

51:24.245 --> 51:26.546
Inside was a princess,

51:26.581 --> 51:29.215
who was a really good
storyteller.

51:30.318 --> 51:32.852
You're pretty good at this.
I think you should keep going.

51:32.887 --> 51:35.588
The princess was also
looking for a prince.

51:35.623 --> 51:38.357
So when the prince came,
he and the princess...

51:38.393 --> 51:41.227
and the little rabbit
of course...

51:41.262 --> 51:43.029
went and did all sorts
of fun stuff together.

51:43.064 --> 51:47.533
They had so much fun that the prince
asked the princess to marry him.

51:47.569 --> 51:50.236
Really?
And then what happened?

51:50.271 --> 51:52.705
They lived happily
ever after, of course.

51:52.740 --> 51:54.774
Of course.

51:54.809 --> 51:56.409
You're so good at these

51:56.444 --> 51:58.155
I think you should be the one
that starts telling them

51:58.179 --> 51:59.912
- at night.
- Dad!

51:59.948 --> 52:01.147
All right, Okay.

52:01.182 --> 52:03.449
I promise I will
keep reading to you

52:03.485 --> 52:05.284
until you find
your special someone.

52:08.656 --> 52:09.956
Good night, sweetie.

52:11.860 --> 52:13.593
Good night.

52:19.900 --> 52:23.926
- Where were you at breakfast?
- I just grabbed coffee and a muffin.

52:23.972 --> 52:25.182
Worked on your vows in my room.

52:25.206 --> 52:28.407
No, never mind the vows.
I've got a debriefing from Tony.

52:28.443 --> 52:29.976
And I've got some serious news.

52:30.011 --> 52:32.645
Hey, Meg!
I hear there's a surprise.

52:32.680 --> 52:34.413
Yes, there is!

52:34.449 --> 52:38.017
All I have to say is,
do not give up hope!

52:39.087 --> 52:40.553
- What?
- Come on.

52:52.667 --> 52:54.434
- Hi!
- Hey.

52:54.469 --> 52:56.636
Is that a hybrid?
I didn't even hear it.

52:56.671 --> 52:58.905
- Surprise!
- What is this?

52:58.940 --> 53:00.673
This is maple syrup art.

53:00.709 --> 53:03.009
- Right?
- Yes, that's exactly it.

53:03.044 --> 53:05.122
We thought it'd be fun if we
made some homemade local treats.

53:05.146 --> 53:07.780
- That you can eat!
- Yes!

53:07.816 --> 53:11.351
- Well, sounds like a good idea.
- So cool. Let's get started.

53:11.386 --> 53:12.852
Everyone grab a partner

53:12.887 --> 53:14.987
and grab a jar
of warm maple syrup.

53:15.023 --> 53:17.623
- You and me, partner.
- Okay!

53:17.659 --> 53:20.960
All right, kiddo.
You and me, kid!

53:20.995 --> 53:22.139
Grab that jar
of warm maple syrup

53:22.163 --> 53:23.329
and you pour it over the snow

53:23.365 --> 53:24.831
and then it solidifies
into candy.

53:24.866 --> 53:27.201
- Can we make shapes with it?
- Of course.

53:27.235 --> 53:28.968
I thought it would be really fun

53:29.003 --> 53:31.771
if we all stuck to the theme
of wedding, and love.

53:32.874 --> 53:35.441
So we can make a heart!

53:35.477 --> 53:37.210
On it, partner. Right?

53:37.245 --> 53:38.277
- All right.
- Cheers.

53:38.313 --> 53:39.479
Here we go!

53:39.514 --> 53:40.913
Dig deep, okay?

53:48.256 --> 53:49.589
Okay.

53:52.360 --> 53:54.327
Tony, no! Too much!

53:55.730 --> 53:56.796
That's good.

53:56.831 --> 53:58.698
That's good.
Okay, let's go...

53:58.733 --> 54:01.033
It's going all over your box!

54:03.571 --> 54:05.838
Nice.

54:12.947 --> 54:15.047
- Does it taste good?
- It's all right, yeah.

54:16.518 --> 54:18.484
Nice.

54:18.520 --> 54:19.886
A perfect little heart.

54:21.356 --> 54:25.224
- No, you're pouring way too much.
- I am.

54:25.260 --> 54:27.493
Okay, so show us
what you've got.

54:29.063 --> 54:30.496
Nice heart!

54:31.766 --> 54:33.833
- Well done!
- "Lov-a".

54:33.868 --> 54:36.903
- What about you two?
- Isn't it obvious?

54:36.938 --> 54:40.173
I don't really think
arts and crafts are my forte.

54:40.208 --> 54:41.252
No, no, no.
I can totally see it.

54:41.276 --> 54:42.575
It's an X and an O.

54:42.610 --> 54:44.744
Jenny's totally right.
It's obvious.

54:44.779 --> 54:48.214
It is the universal symbol
of hugs...

54:48.249 --> 54:49.449
and kisses!

54:52.921 --> 54:55.455
Well, guys,
this was so much fun.

54:55.490 --> 54:57.256
Thank you
for such a great surprise.

54:57.292 --> 54:58.569
Daddy, can we go
to the general store?

54:58.593 --> 55:01.928
Sure.
Yeah, I don't see why not.

55:01.963 --> 55:04.442
Jenny, do you wanna come?
They have so many neat things.

55:04.466 --> 55:07.144
Yeah, Jenny would love to come
and she'll meet you right there, 'Kay?

55:07.168 --> 55:08.634
Let's go!

55:08.670 --> 55:10.770
- All right.
- All right, see ya.

55:10.805 --> 55:12.605
Jenny, just wait a second.

55:12.640 --> 55:15.641
Tony, tell her what you told me
about Lana and Craig.

55:15.677 --> 55:18.478
He said he felt like he should
invite her, 'cause, you know.

55:18.513 --> 55:21.247
- No, I... I don't.
- They're just friends, Jenny.

55:21.282 --> 55:23.127
That's what he said, right?
They're just friends?

55:23.151 --> 55:24.817
Yeah, after I kicked
his butt at darts.

55:24.853 --> 55:26.831
Okay, wait. So you're telling me
that they're not a couple?

55:26.855 --> 55:30.122
Craig's a really nice guy
and she's helped him out a lot

55:30.158 --> 55:32.158
and so, yeah.
He... you know.

55:32.193 --> 55:33.726
No, Tony. I don't know!

55:33.761 --> 55:35.328
She wants more and he knows it

55:35.363 --> 55:37.530
but he doesn't know
if that's what he wants.

55:39.300 --> 55:42.468
- Are you sure?
- No doubt.

55:42.504 --> 55:43.970
We fist-bumped on it.

55:44.005 --> 55:45.671
Go get him.

55:45.707 --> 55:48.474
- Go, go, go!
- Okay.

55:59.187 --> 56:01.888
- This is so pretty!
- Yeah!

56:01.923 --> 56:03.556
I think you should get it

56:03.591 --> 56:05.591
because it will go with
the surprise I got for you.

56:06.794 --> 56:09.881
Speaking of which,
I just have to get this.

56:09.882 --> 56:11.064
Hello?

56:11.100 --> 56:12.899
Great...

56:12.935 --> 56:15.102
Gonna make you look
just like a princess!

56:15.137 --> 56:16.236
- Isn't it pretty?
- Yes.

56:16.271 --> 56:18.472
I just wish it would stay on.

56:18.507 --> 56:20.474
You know what?
It probably just...

56:20.509 --> 56:22.642
You know what?
It just needs some hair pins.

56:22.678 --> 56:23.988
Yeah, I can bring it back,
put some in.

56:24.012 --> 56:25.946
I brought like a million
for Meg's veil.

56:25.981 --> 56:30.083
That's what we'll do!
We'll make a veil for Meg!

56:30.119 --> 56:31.885
We'll take this...

56:31.920 --> 56:34.121
and then we'll get
some beading and some tulle.

56:34.156 --> 56:36.056
- I'll go look for some.
- Great.

56:36.091 --> 56:37.335
And maybe you can
help me make it?

56:37.359 --> 56:38.959
- Yeah.
- Cool!

56:40.329 --> 56:42.896
More arts and crafts.
You are making her day.

56:42.931 --> 56:45.398
Well, don't worry.
I'm not gonna ask you to join in.

56:48.871 --> 56:50.103
What?

56:50.139 --> 56:51.638
My boss likes my...
my... my story.

56:51.673 --> 56:52.673
She wants to publish it!

56:52.708 --> 56:54.141
- Seriously?
- Yes!

56:54.176 --> 56:55.509
- Congratulations!
- Thank you!

56:55.544 --> 56:57.477
That's amazing!

57:02.518 --> 57:04.751
You must be so happy!
This is what you wanted!

57:04.787 --> 57:06.965
It totally is!
I mean, and... You know what?

57:06.989 --> 57:08.155
I think Meg's right.

57:08.190 --> 57:09.790
Maybe my plan
is coming together.

57:09.825 --> 57:13.827
- What plan?
- Well my work plan.

57:13.862 --> 57:15.295
My...

57:15.330 --> 57:16.875
I always wanted to be
a children's book writer

57:16.899 --> 57:19.099
and it looks like
I'm gonna get published, so.

57:19.134 --> 57:21.334
Well, it's so great
when wishes come true.

57:21.370 --> 57:22.936
Yeah.

57:24.306 --> 57:26.006
Yeah, I should actually get back

57:26.041 --> 57:28.508
because I need to deliver
the rest of the story.

57:28.544 --> 57:33.880
Yes, I love it. Let's do this.
See you at rehearsal dinner.

57:33.916 --> 57:35.749
Okay.

57:55.871 --> 57:58.471
That store was adorable.

57:58.507 --> 58:00.674
I have a surprise for you.

58:02.044 --> 58:03.410
- Hello.
- Hi.

58:03.445 --> 58:05.011
I should have a package here
for Devero.

58:05.047 --> 58:08.048
I do.

58:08.083 --> 58:10.183
- Here you go, Ms. Devero.
- Thank you.

58:10.219 --> 58:13.119
- What is it?
- Open it.

58:15.891 --> 58:18.225
- This is so pretty!
- Yeah.

58:18.260 --> 58:20.405
I got it for you so you could
wear it to dinner tonight.

58:20.429 --> 58:23.496
- Thank you, Lana.
- You're welcome.

58:23.532 --> 58:26.166
I'll show Jenny when I'm
helping her with her veil.

58:26.201 --> 58:27.534
What veil?

58:27.569 --> 58:29.402
Meg lost hers
so we're making her a new one.

58:29.438 --> 58:30.604
Can I go, Daddy?

58:30.639 --> 58:33.039
Yeah, of course you can.
Go ahead.

58:33.075 --> 58:36.443
Okay. Just be careful.

58:36.478 --> 58:38.545
There you go.

58:38.580 --> 58:41.348
- Just don't be late for dinner!
- Okay!

58:42.484 --> 58:43.728
I knew that she would love that.

58:43.752 --> 58:46.353
I've really gotten to know her
over the past couple years.

58:46.388 --> 58:48.288
You've been really great
to her, Lana.

58:48.323 --> 58:50.690
Well, I've gotten
to know you too.

58:50.726 --> 58:53.460
Yes, there's no doubt that
you've been there for both of us.

58:53.495 --> 58:57.030
And I hope to be here longer,
if given the chance.

59:00.302 --> 59:03.270
Craig, I know that we've had
this conversation before

59:03.305 --> 59:05.071
and you said you needed time,

59:05.107 --> 59:09.075
but I guess I'm just wondering
when that time will be.

59:10.579 --> 59:13.146
You don't need to answer right now.
Just think about it.

59:13.181 --> 59:15.782
I'm gonna go get ready
for dinner.

59:29.698 --> 59:31.464
Jenny, look!

59:33.702 --> 59:35.602
What a beautiful dress!

59:35.637 --> 59:37.772
Lana got it for me.
How does the veil look?

59:38.840 --> 59:39.906
You know what?

59:39.942 --> 59:42.409
I think it looks pretty good.
It's right here.

59:42.444 --> 59:44.277
I saved the beading for you,
of course.

59:46.181 --> 59:49.816
Here, see?
There, and then here.

59:51.653 --> 59:52.653
I'll help you. I'll hold.

59:57.993 --> 01:00:00.493
Sounds like Lana takes
really good care of you.

01:00:00.529 --> 01:00:02.462
Yeah, she's really nice.

01:00:02.497 --> 01:00:06.032
And she always
buys me nice things, but...

01:00:06.068 --> 01:00:08.501
she doesn't have to, though.

01:00:08.537 --> 01:00:10.503
When my dad and mom
were together,

01:00:10.539 --> 01:00:13.340
he was always laughing
and acting goofy.

01:00:13.375 --> 01:00:16.209
Maybe she just brings out
a different side in him.

01:00:16.244 --> 01:00:19.312
I want my dad to be happy,
like he was with my mom.

01:00:19.348 --> 01:00:21.348
Like he is with you.

01:00:21.383 --> 01:00:24.150
Which is why I'm pretty sure
my wish will come true.

01:00:24.186 --> 01:00:25.485
Your wish?

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:27.487
The one I made
on the shooting star.

01:00:27.522 --> 01:00:29.456
If I whisper it to you
and no one hears,

01:00:29.491 --> 01:00:31.124
it can still come true.

01:00:31.159 --> 01:00:33.493
But you can't tell anyone.
Do you promise?

01:00:33.528 --> 01:00:34.861
I promise.

01:00:36.064 --> 01:00:39.099
I wish for...

01:00:41.203 --> 01:00:43.570
Honey, I don't know
if that wish can come true.

01:00:43.605 --> 01:00:46.539
Sure it can.
You just have to believe.

01:00:48.910 --> 01:00:51.911
- How does it look?
- You know what? I think...

01:00:51.947 --> 01:00:54.814
I think it's gonna be beautiful.

01:00:54.850 --> 01:00:58.518
And I think it's gonna
make Meg's day perfect.

01:00:58.553 --> 01:01:00.420
I should go get dressed
so I'm not late.

01:01:00.455 --> 01:01:03.990
- I'll see you later?
- Yes, absolutely.

01:01:04.026 --> 01:01:06.126
- Thanks for poppin' by.
- You're welcome!

01:01:57.846 --> 01:01:59.081
There you go!

01:02:00.049 --> 01:02:02.716
Oh, no! I forgot to bring my
hair wreath from Jenny's room!

01:02:02.751 --> 01:02:04.384
That's okay.
I'll go get it

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:05.864
and you stay here
and finish getting ready

01:02:05.888 --> 01:02:07.032
so we're not late
for the shuttle.

01:02:07.056 --> 01:02:08.489
Thank you.

01:02:14.763 --> 01:02:16.230
Jenny?

01:02:18.234 --> 01:02:19.566
Jenny?

01:02:51.966 --> 01:02:56.736
Look at you!
You're so beautiful.

01:02:57.773 --> 01:02:58.972
Your vows.

01:02:59.007 --> 01:03:00.474
This is amazing.

01:03:00.509 --> 01:03:02.576
- Thank you.
- Of course.

01:03:02.611 --> 01:03:03.822
How did the rest
of the afternoon go?

01:03:03.846 --> 01:03:05.479
My boss called.

01:03:05.514 --> 01:03:07.592
She's gonna publish my story,
the one about the ice castle!

01:03:07.616 --> 01:03:08.648
- What?
- I know!

01:03:08.684 --> 01:03:10.517
- Jen, you did it!
- Yes!

01:03:10.552 --> 01:03:13.120
And for once, one of your plans
are gonna come true.

01:03:13.155 --> 01:03:15.355
And even my little one
about you and Craig!

01:03:15.390 --> 01:03:17.624
Well, about that...

01:03:17.659 --> 01:03:20.193
I don't know, I'm torn.

01:03:20.229 --> 01:03:24.297
I mean, I know what I want
and I know what Sara wants

01:03:24.333 --> 01:03:27.434
but I don't know
if that's what he wants.

01:03:27.469 --> 01:03:28.947
You know, I mean,
even Tony said he's unsure.

01:03:28.971 --> 01:03:31.371
So,

01:03:31.406 --> 01:03:32.973
I don't know
if he's just confused.

01:03:35.377 --> 01:03:38.512
Honestly, Jen...

01:03:38.547 --> 01:03:40.580
I don't see any confusion
on that man's face.

01:03:41.817 --> 01:03:42.817
Sara.

01:03:42.851 --> 01:03:46.453
What a crown!
Come on, let's go show Tony!

01:03:48.023 --> 01:03:53.660
You look...
you look very nice.

01:03:53.695 --> 01:03:55.128
So do you.

01:03:55.164 --> 01:03:57.697
Yeah, I've been known
to pull myself together.

01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:03.203
Is it me or is it
really hot in here?

01:04:03.238 --> 01:04:04.738
No, it is.

01:04:04.773 --> 01:04:06.384
It's a little warm in here.
I think we're finally

01:04:06.408 --> 01:04:07.819
getting used to
this hotel temperature.

01:04:07.843 --> 01:04:09.309
Yes, that's it.

01:04:09.344 --> 01:04:11.812
Do you...

01:04:11.847 --> 01:04:14.614
do you wanna step outside
for a second?

01:04:15.684 --> 01:04:16.950
Yes.

01:04:43.445 --> 01:04:46.379
Sure am gonna miss seeing
these stars every night.

01:04:46.415 --> 01:04:47.747
Yeah.

01:04:47.783 --> 01:04:50.083
It has been
somethin' special up here.

01:04:52.221 --> 01:04:53.386
In a lot of ways.

01:04:56.892 --> 01:04:58.425
- Cold?
- I'm fine.

01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:01.962
I'm fine.

01:05:32.661 --> 01:05:36.296
I...
I have to...

01:05:36.331 --> 01:05:38.965
I have to tell you somethin'.

01:05:39.001 --> 01:05:42.435
Lana...

01:05:42.471 --> 01:05:43.803
Look, Lana...

01:05:43.839 --> 01:05:47.874
Lana's been a big part of our lives
since Sara's mom passed.

01:05:50.646 --> 01:05:53.546
And you know,
Sara really likes her.

01:05:56.385 --> 01:06:00.687
You know? And then,
and then I meet you.

01:06:00.722 --> 01:06:02.689
Jenny, you're...

01:06:02.724 --> 01:06:04.958
I mean, you are
something special.

01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:10.664
But, it's just...

01:06:10.699 --> 01:06:11.898
confusing. I mean...

01:06:13.802 --> 01:06:15.113
And it's just...
You know what, it's...

01:06:15.137 --> 01:06:16.447
Sara's so young... You know what?

01:06:16.471 --> 01:06:19.839
...you don't have to
say anything else.

01:06:19.875 --> 01:06:21.908
I get it.

01:06:23.078 --> 01:06:24.177
I get it.

01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:28.682
I don't...

01:06:28.717 --> 01:06:34.187
I don't wanna be a complication
for you or for Sara, so...

01:06:36.391 --> 01:06:38.158
I get it.

01:06:47.336 --> 01:06:49.936
We should probably
just go inside.

01:06:55.344 --> 01:06:56.776
Okay.

01:06:58.413 --> 01:06:59.479
Okay.

01:07:19.935 --> 01:07:22.803
There's the lucky couple.
Sorry I'm late.

01:07:22.838 --> 01:07:25.539
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey, Dad!

01:07:25.574 --> 01:07:27.574
We're just waiting for one more.

01:07:29.812 --> 01:07:32.479
Sorry I'm late.
Sky is breathtaking tonight.

01:07:32.514 --> 01:07:34.748
Hi, Dad.

01:07:34.783 --> 01:07:38.318
Checking out the stars, were we?

01:07:38.353 --> 01:07:40.620
Yeah.

01:07:40.656 --> 01:07:43.056
Well, looks like that shooting
star was lucky after all.

01:07:44.626 --> 01:07:47.427
Well, your mom told me.
You're getting published.

01:07:50.599 --> 01:07:53.266
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:07:53.302 --> 01:07:57.471
- And that is worth celebrating.
- That's the spirit.

01:08:02.576 --> 01:08:04.143
I'm sorry to interrupt,
everyone.

01:08:04.746 --> 01:08:06.446
Tony asked me not to do this,

01:08:06.481 --> 01:08:10.417
but just before we start dinner
I would like to say a few words.

01:08:10.952 --> 01:08:13.453
You know, when Tony
first told me about Meg,

01:08:13.488 --> 01:08:16.689
I knew that just by
the look in his eye

01:08:16.725 --> 01:08:18.191
that she was the woman
of his dreams.

01:08:18.225 --> 01:08:20.727
And to be honest,

01:08:20.761 --> 01:08:23.796
I would say that you're
a lucky man, Tony.

01:08:23.832 --> 01:08:25.765
Absolutely.

01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:27.700
Finding a woman
that you genuinely love

01:08:27.736 --> 01:08:31.304
with that big,
soft heart of yours.

01:08:31.339 --> 01:08:33.406
And who loves you back
in return.

01:08:36.411 --> 01:08:40.446
Tony, you are...
you're a good man.

01:08:40.482 --> 01:08:43.149
And you're a great friend.

01:08:43.184 --> 01:08:46.219
And now that you've met Meg,
you are the best

01:08:46.254 --> 01:08:47.987
that you're ever gonna be.

01:08:50.059 --> 01:08:52.859
- So cheers to the happy couple.
- Cheers. Thank you.

01:08:52.895 --> 01:08:54.795
Cheers.

01:08:54.830 --> 01:08:57.531
I love you.

01:08:58.020 --> 01:08:59.832
- I love you.
- I love you too.

01:09:05.274 --> 01:09:06.274
Hear, hear.

01:09:06.308 --> 01:09:07.308
Cheers!

01:09:07.341 --> 01:09:09.076
- Hear, hear.
- Cheers.

01:09:19.988 --> 01:09:23.457
<i>And so this story ends
where it began,</i>

01:09:23.492 --> 01:09:27.260
<i>in the far reaches
of the north...</i>

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:30.596
<i>...in a castle made of ice...</i>

01:09:30.631 --> 01:09:32.933
<i>...where happily ever afters
do come true.</i>

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:37.304
Just not mine.

01:09:47.883 --> 01:09:51.251
Job on the hair wreath.
It stayed on my head all night.

01:09:51.286 --> 01:09:53.286
Yeah, she did.

01:09:55.657 --> 01:09:57.624
Why are you sad?

01:09:59.995 --> 01:10:01.795
I'm not sad.

01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:03.790
How can I be? We're gonna
have a wedding tomorrow!

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:06.634
I wish I had one of
Jenny's sleeping potions

01:10:06.669 --> 01:10:07.901
and one of her stories.

01:10:07.937 --> 01:10:09.570
'Cause I'm too excited to sleep.

01:10:11.307 --> 01:10:13.907
Well, how bout I go get you
a glass of warm milk?

01:10:13.943 --> 01:10:14.975
That'll help.

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:18.812
Okay.

01:10:28.024 --> 01:10:30.424
Lana.
Where... where you going?

01:10:30.459 --> 01:10:32.660
- I'm leaving.
- You're leaving?

01:10:32.695 --> 01:10:34.055
Yeah. It was a mistake
coming here.

01:10:35.564 --> 01:10:37.464
I don't understand.

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:39.933
I thought you were excited
to come to the wedding.

01:10:39.969 --> 01:10:42.269
I was. I was excited.

01:10:43.839 --> 01:10:45.472
Look, Craig,

01:10:45.508 --> 01:10:48.976
my intent was always
just to bring you comfort.

01:10:49.011 --> 01:10:50.611
But it seems like
the past couple days

01:10:50.646 --> 01:10:53.647
the idea of "us"
is making you uncomfortable

01:10:53.683 --> 01:10:55.449
and I don't want that.

01:10:55.484 --> 01:10:57.651
So I think it's best
if we just both move on.

01:11:00.189 --> 01:11:05.993
- But I thought that you wanted...
- I wanted us to be a family.

01:11:06.028 --> 01:11:08.262
But everyone deserves
to have their wishes come true

01:11:08.297 --> 01:11:10.164
and honestly, I...

01:11:10.199 --> 01:11:12.333
I just don't think
it's what Sara wants.

01:11:17.006 --> 01:11:20.674
- I'm so sorry, Lana.
- It's okay.

01:11:20.710 --> 01:11:23.644
It's okay, because everyone
deserves to be loved

01:11:23.679 --> 01:11:25.379
and find that special someone.

01:11:25.414 --> 01:11:29.150
And I really hope
that you find yours.

01:11:29.185 --> 01:11:31.752
And I know that
I'll find mine too.

01:11:38.194 --> 01:11:40.694
Thank you for...

01:11:40.730 --> 01:11:43.364
everything that
you've done for us.

01:11:44.534 --> 01:11:47.501
Just... give Sara a hug for me.

01:11:47.537 --> 01:11:49.003
Of course.

01:11:51.874 --> 01:11:53.174
Hey.

01:11:53.209 --> 01:11:54.675
When you find
that special someone,

01:11:54.710 --> 01:11:58.345
he's gonna be the luckiest guy
in the world.

01:12:02.351 --> 01:12:03.717
Goodbye, Craig.

01:12:04.854 --> 01:12:05.953
Bye, Lana.

01:12:21.971 --> 01:12:24.004
Hey.

01:12:25.708 --> 01:12:28.542
When the prince asked
the princess to marry him,

01:12:28.578 --> 01:12:31.011
was the little rabbit happy?

01:12:37.486 --> 01:12:40.087
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:12:56.472 --> 01:12:59.573
Ms. Devero.
Is everything all right?

01:12:59.609 --> 01:13:02.243
Yes! Yes.
Everything is fine.

01:13:02.278 --> 01:13:05.246
- But you're leaving us.
- I am.

01:13:05.281 --> 01:13:08.382
Actually, I would love a shuttle
to the airport, please.

01:13:08.417 --> 01:13:10.050
Well, I'd be happy
to call one for you

01:13:10.086 --> 01:13:11.986
but at this hour they're
all stationed in town.

01:13:12.021 --> 01:13:13.887
Perhaps I could assist you.

01:13:13.923 --> 01:13:15.656
My shift is over
in just ten minutes.

01:13:15.691 --> 01:13:18.158
I could drive you.

01:13:18.194 --> 01:13:20.427
- I would like that very much.
- Allow me.

01:13:23.132 --> 01:13:27.401
- You are very helpful.
- Thank you.

01:14:05.713 --> 01:14:08.175
Let me tell ya, I still can't
believe we got this venue.

01:14:08.210 --> 01:14:10.144
It's amazing.
Just beautiful.

01:14:10.179 --> 01:14:12.012
- Craig, my man!
- Hey.

01:14:12.048 --> 01:14:13.881
Clark and I,
or should I say Dad and I,

01:14:13.916 --> 01:14:15.883
- are about to go play some darts.
- Not anymore.

01:14:15.918 --> 01:14:17.529
Linda needs me to check
if the flowers arrived.

01:14:17.553 --> 01:14:18.952
Craig, what do ya say?

01:14:18.988 --> 01:14:20.365
One last game
before I'm a married man?

01:14:20.389 --> 01:14:22.189
I was actually gonna go
grab some breakfast.

01:14:25.661 --> 01:14:27.394
I really don't get it.

01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:29.697
- It's like she's got some sort of radar.
- Who, Meg?

01:14:29.732 --> 01:14:31.510
Yeah, she's checking
to make sure my suit is pressed.

01:14:31.534 --> 01:14:32.833
Get used to it.

01:14:32.868 --> 01:14:34.335
After you're married,

01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:36.470
you are zeroed in
by the husband satellite.

01:14:38.174 --> 01:14:40.254
The satellite that checks
every husband in the world.

01:14:41.577 --> 01:14:44.211
So, I guess I better
just go get ready then.

01:14:44.246 --> 01:14:47.548
Yeah. Before I forget,
have you guys seen the ladies?

01:14:47.583 --> 01:14:49.016
Meg and Jenny?

01:14:49.051 --> 01:14:51.418
No, they're probably
getting ready somewhere.

01:14:51.454 --> 01:14:54.555
- I'll catch you after breakfast?
- Yeah, sounds good.

01:15:00.296 --> 01:15:01.328
Yes!

01:15:01.364 --> 01:15:03.497
What do you think?

01:15:03.532 --> 01:15:06.600
Yes, it's perfect!
It's perfect, except...

01:15:06.635 --> 01:15:08.469
it's missing one little thing.

01:15:10.439 --> 01:15:11.839
I love it!

01:15:11.874 --> 01:15:14.007
- Thank you!
- Sara and I made it.

01:15:14.043 --> 01:15:16.443
Sorry I'm late but you're never
gonna believe what happened.

01:15:16.479 --> 01:15:19.513
I was leaving the hotel
and the concierge told me

01:15:19.548 --> 01:15:21.515
somebody turned this in.

01:15:21.550 --> 01:15:22.883
- No.
- My veil!

01:15:22.918 --> 01:15:25.352
Isn't that lucky?

01:15:25.388 --> 01:15:27.354
Thank you, but actually,

01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:29.089
I think I'd much rather
wear this one,

01:15:29.125 --> 01:15:30.691
because my sister made it,

01:15:30.726 --> 01:15:33.360
with help from a little girl
who has a big heart.

01:15:33.396 --> 01:15:36.563
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

01:15:36.599 --> 01:15:39.300
- You look beautiful!
- Mom?

01:15:39.335 --> 01:15:40.801
Mom, you gotta... You can't.

01:15:40.836 --> 01:15:42.114
With the makeup
and the ceremony.

01:15:42.138 --> 01:15:44.238
I know.
I know, it's just...

01:15:45.608 --> 01:15:49.109
- Come on.
- Oh my goodness.

01:15:49.145 --> 01:15:51.545
We are gonna go through
so many tissues today.

01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:52.913
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:15:52.948 --> 01:15:55.416
- And how 'bout you?
- What?!

01:15:55.451 --> 01:15:58.318
Are you getting your hair done
for your best man?

01:15:58.354 --> 01:16:00.454
No, I'm getting my hair done
for you,

01:16:00.489 --> 01:16:03.957
because today
is about you, not me.

01:16:05.161 --> 01:16:06.727
It's your day.

01:16:19.175 --> 01:16:21.508
So, all the table
centrepieces arrived?

01:16:21.544 --> 01:16:24.244
- Yep, all of them.
- And all the candle arrangements?

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:26.814
Don't worry.
It's all been taken care of.

01:16:26.849 --> 01:16:29.617
- And where's the groom?
- That I don't know.

01:16:29.652 --> 01:16:32.052
Hi.

01:16:33.189 --> 01:16:34.621
There you are.

01:16:34.657 --> 01:16:36.790
Tony taught me
how to play darts!

01:16:36.826 --> 01:16:39.126
He did, did he?

01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:43.197
- Is that mustard?
- What? Where?

01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:45.599
Where's Lana?

01:16:45.634 --> 01:16:48.302
She had to go
back to work in the city.

01:16:48.337 --> 01:16:51.772
But she said that she's
sorry she missed you.

01:16:51.807 --> 01:16:53.307
Come on, everyone.

01:16:53.342 --> 01:16:55.843
Let's find our seats
in our respective places.

01:17:00.683 --> 01:17:02.115
- This is it.
- You ready for this?

01:17:02.151 --> 01:17:03.884
You all right?

01:17:03.919 --> 01:17:04.985
Gettin' there.

01:17:09.091 --> 01:17:11.124
Is it hot in here?

01:17:12.194 --> 01:17:14.962
No.

01:17:14.997 --> 01:17:16.630
It's all right, man.
You got this.

01:17:47.696 --> 01:17:49.563
Hi.

01:18:50.593 --> 01:18:53.460
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are gathered here today

01:18:53.495 --> 01:18:57.131
to celebrate the union
of Anthony and Megan.

01:18:57.166 --> 01:19:00.801
The vows that you are both
about to make

01:19:00.837 --> 01:19:04.438
are a way to share your love
and commitment to one another

01:19:04.474 --> 01:19:05.806
in your own words.

01:19:05.842 --> 01:19:09.210
So without further ado, Megan?

01:19:09.245 --> 01:19:13.748
My dearest Anthony,
you're my best friend.

01:19:13.783 --> 01:19:16.717
You're the person I trust
more than anyone in the world.

01:19:16.753 --> 01:19:19.820
And you are the best chocolate
chip banana pancake maker.

01:19:21.624 --> 01:19:24.458
You make me smile
when I'm feeling down,

01:19:24.494 --> 01:19:27.895
you assure me I'm not crazy
when I'm crazy.

01:19:27.930 --> 01:19:30.998
You make me a better person
in so many ways,

01:19:31.034 --> 01:19:34.168
and I am so blessed
to be able to laugh with you

01:19:34.203 --> 01:19:36.526
and cry with you,

01:19:37.073 --> 01:19:38.906
and spend the rest
of our lives together.

01:19:40.243 --> 01:19:43.711
I promise I will do
all the hard work

01:19:43.746 --> 01:19:46.581
to make sure now means always.

01:19:46.616 --> 01:19:50.551
To support you with love
in word and in deed.

01:19:50.587 --> 01:19:54.288
You have my heart
today and always.

01:19:54.324 --> 01:19:55.790
I love you, Anthony.

01:20:04.434 --> 01:20:07.468
- Too soon!
- Sorry.

01:20:07.503 --> 01:20:09.136
Forgot we had to wait
till the end.

01:20:09.172 --> 01:20:11.672
Please, it's your day.

01:20:19.816 --> 01:20:21.616
Let's carry on, shall we?

01:20:25.855 --> 01:20:28.589
Hey, kiddo.
Save some for the rest of us.

01:20:29.626 --> 01:20:31.425
Hey.

01:20:31.461 --> 01:20:32.660
Where is Lana?

01:20:32.695 --> 01:20:34.295
I didn't see her
at the ceremony.

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:38.032
- Daddy said she had to go home.
- She did? Why?

01:20:38.067 --> 01:20:39.433
She thought it was best.

01:20:41.704 --> 01:20:44.505
Hey, Sara.
Come on, dance with us.

01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:46.073
Come on, come on!

01:20:47.043 --> 01:20:48.376
I don't understand.

01:20:48.411 --> 01:20:52.380
Lana deserves someone
who truly love her,

01:20:52.415 --> 01:20:54.515
and who's not unsure
of the circumstances.

01:20:56.653 --> 01:20:58.185
What I've come to realize

01:20:58.221 --> 01:21:02.089
is that it's not the
circumstances that bring me joy.

01:21:03.927 --> 01:21:05.426
It's you.

01:21:09.999 --> 01:21:12.199
A few days ago I made a wish
on a shooting star,

01:21:12.235 --> 01:21:15.670
that all Sara's wishes
would come true.

01:21:15.705 --> 01:21:18.940
Now, I have no idea
what she wished for.

01:21:20.510 --> 01:21:22.643
All I know is that
everything has changed.

01:21:24.113 --> 01:21:26.847
Well, change can be good.

01:21:28.885 --> 01:21:33.321
- What did you wish for?
- I can't tell you that.

01:21:33.356 --> 01:21:35.289
Then my dreams won't come true.

01:21:52.875 --> 01:21:53.908
Hey, sis!

01:22:00.917 --> 01:22:02.617
See? I told you.

01:22:02.652 --> 01:22:05.720
If you don't say your wish out
loud, it will come true.

01:22:05.755 --> 01:22:06.788
Yes!

01:22:12.362 --> 01:22:15.063
So.

01:22:15.098 --> 01:22:16.964
What's next?

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.001
Well, I was thinking...

01:22:20.036 --> 01:22:21.969
New Zealand might be
a destination

01:22:22.005 --> 01:22:23.404
that I want to go to.

01:22:24.507 --> 01:22:26.374
Me too!

01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:29.077
Destination wedding?

01:22:34.818 --> 01:22:37.150
- Do you wanna dance?
- Yes.
