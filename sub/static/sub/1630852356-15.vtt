09:00.290 --> 09:01.919
Throw in the towel.

09:01.920 --> 09:04.709
Uh, did you hear me, bucko?
It's quittin' time.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.789
- No!
- Wha-whuh?

09:06.790 --> 09:08.789
I came here
to give my family a meal.

09:08.790 --> 09:11.959
And now it's time to earn it.

09:11.960 --> 09:13.039
Yaaaah!

09:13.040 --> 09:14.539
Hyah!

09:14.540 --> 09:16.170
[loud chomping]

09:22.620 --> 09:24.119
Look at him go!

09:24.120 --> 09:25.379
What do you mean
you don't have money?!

09:25.380 --> 09:26.619
You're a bank!

09:26.620 --> 09:28.039
Hey, would you be interested

09:28.040 --> 09:29.499
in purchasing
this fine leather jacket?

09:29.500 --> 09:31.879
Or how about a motorcycle?
Or my trailer?

09:31.880 --> 09:33.539
I've got a real nice trailer!

09:33.540 --> 09:35.459
Fancy these teeth, young man?

09:35.460 --> 09:37.459
One of them is gold.

09:37.460 --> 09:38.879
It's useless.

09:38.880 --> 09:39.959
[customers, chanting]
Eat that cream!

09:39.960 --> 09:41.169
- Eat that cream!
- What is that?

09:41.170 --> 09:42.170
- Ooooh!
- Wow!

09:42.171 --> 09:43.209
Excuse me, pardon me.

09:43.210 --> 09:45.289
Now what in the world is--?

09:45.290 --> 09:47.329
No, it can't be.

09:47.330 --> 09:49.379
Is that... Cricket?

09:49.380 --> 09:51.620
[chomps, groans]

09:56.790 --> 09:58.879
That boy is destroying himself!

09:58.880 --> 10:00.539
Son, you don't have to do this!

10:00.540 --> 10:02.619
Yeah, we'll find another way!

10:02.620 --> 10:04.829
Kid, listen to your family!

10:04.830 --> 10:07.379
If you explode,
it'll be horrible
publicity for Crispy's!

10:07.380 --> 10:10.459
I'll knock 50--
No, 75% off your meal

10:10.460 --> 10:12.379
if you stop right now!

10:12.380 --> 10:15.379
[grunts]
My. Family.

10:15.380 --> 10:17.829
Eats! Freee!

10:17.830 --> 10:20.539
Aaah yaaah!

10:20.540 --> 10:24.540
[ethereal singing]

10:31.170 --> 10:32.210
[chomp]

10:34.000 --> 10:35.539
- [cheering]
- You did it!

10:35.540 --> 10:37.669
It... it's not possible!

10:37.670 --> 10:40.789
No one's ever finished
the Crispy's Sundae Challenge!

10:40.790 --> 10:41.790
Yeah!

10:41.791 --> 10:42.919
Cricket!

10:42.920 --> 10:45.079
Easy, easy now.
We got ya, son.

10:45.080 --> 10:46.119
[groans]

10:46.120 --> 10:48.119
Well, now we got ya!

10:48.120 --> 10:49.789
Cricket, I have
to hand it to ya.

10:49.790 --> 10:51.879
You really earned that meal.

10:51.880 --> 10:53.209
Ya done good, boy!

10:53.210 --> 10:54.829
You really pulled
through, Cricket!

10:54.830 --> 10:56.209
You're my hero, brother.

10:56.210 --> 10:58.119
Eh, thanks, everyone.

10:58.120 --> 10:59.879
And I'd just like to say--

10:59.880 --> 11:02.169
[belching]

11:02.170 --> 11:04.380
Heh, s'cuse me.
