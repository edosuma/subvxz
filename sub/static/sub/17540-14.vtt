(growling)

00:14.247 --> 00:16.014
Oh, there's too many of them!

00:16.049 --> 00:17.883
Evie, we need help.

00:17.918 --> 00:19.351
Ally:
Attack!

00:19.386 --> 00:21.386
AK's to the rescue!

00:21.421 --> 00:24.156
Oh, here they come
to save the day!

00:24.191 --> 00:25.424
Let's get them!

00:25.459 --> 00:27.225
Five, six, seven, eight!

00:27.260 --> 00:29.094
-Take that!
-Jordan: And that!

00:29.129 --> 00:31.396
-And some of this!
-And some of that!

00:31.431 --> 00:33.999
While you guys
work out your differences,

00:34.034 --> 00:35.901
I'm going to go take
over Auradon!

00:35.936 --> 00:39.171
Evie, keep Zevon distracted
while I go for the staff.

00:39.206 --> 00:40.372
I got you, fam.

00:40.407 --> 00:41.407
You always do.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.109
Hi-ya!

00:44.144 --> 00:45.744
You ruined everything...

00:45.779 --> 00:47.612
and you're not
even enrolled here!

00:47.647 --> 00:48.713
Ba-bam!

00:48.748 --> 00:49.748
(screams)

00:49.783 --> 00:51.083
(quacking)

00:51.118 --> 00:52.284
I think it's an improvement.

00:52.319 --> 00:54.286
Wing of bat and raven's eye,

00:54.321 --> 00:55.921
lift me up into the sky.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.392
Whoooahh...
whoa!

01:01.394 --> 01:02.627
Hi-ya...

01:02.662 --> 01:04.062
(whimpers)

01:04.097 --> 01:05.130
Aw...

01:05.165 --> 01:07.132
-(screams)
-Aah!

01:07.167 --> 01:09.301
I wish these puppets were...

01:11.071 --> 01:12.904
We're free!

01:12.939 --> 01:14.573
Look out!

01:14.608 --> 01:16.909
Carlos:
You're going down,
you dime-store Pinocchio!

01:18.245 --> 01:20.445
(all shouting)

01:20.480 --> 01:22.747
Woo-hoo!
Puppet dominoes!

01:22.782 --> 01:24.483
Once I add the last jewel,

01:24.518 --> 01:26.451
I will be unstoppable.

01:26.486 --> 01:27.619
Ah!

01:27.654 --> 01:29.455
Reflect on this!

01:31.758 --> 01:33.658
It's over, Zevon.

01:33.693 --> 01:34.826
Not yet, Mal.

01:34.861 --> 01:37.062
I also stole your jewel.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.730
Uh...

01:38.765 --> 01:40.065
Mal!

01:40.100 --> 01:42.100
That's my friend
you're messing with.

01:42.135 --> 01:43.468
Ugh!

01:43.503 --> 01:45.570
Oh no, no, no!

01:45.605 --> 01:47.572
-Kablam.
-Ah!

01:47.607 --> 01:49.174
(screaming)

01:49.209 --> 01:51.176
Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

01:51.211 --> 01:53.311
Ohhhhh!

01:53.346 --> 01:55.214
Now to undo your evil.

01:57.350 --> 01:59.852
(duck quacking)

02:01.354 --> 02:03.489
We will never
speak of this again.

02:08.161 --> 02:09.661
Hey, watch the collar.

02:09.696 --> 02:11.429
Ow! Ooh! Ow, ow!

02:11.464 --> 02:12.831
Later, Zevon.

02:12.866 --> 02:15.634
Don't get lost
on the way to the Isle!

02:15.669 --> 02:18.303
-See what I did there?
-I saw.

02:20.407 --> 02:21.806
That should remove the curse.

02:21.841 --> 02:24.442
And now there's only
one thing left to do.

02:24.477 --> 02:25.710
Jewel-bilee?

02:25.745 --> 02:27.045
No...

02:27.080 --> 02:28.680
Jewel-bilee!

02:28.715 --> 02:30.482
Yeah!

02:30.517 --> 02:32.684
(cheering)
