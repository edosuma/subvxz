03:48.962 --> 03:53.499
WILL IT BE USED TO SAVE
MIRAI OR CARSON?

03:53.566 --> 03:58.037
PLUS, WITH THE MON WON TWIST
LOOMING ONLY ONE THING'S FOR

03:58.104 --> 04:02.141
SURE: BESIDES MIESHA AND
CYNTHIA, NO CELEB IS SAFE.

04:02.208 --> 04:04.711
WHO WILL BE THE FIRST SENT
PACKING?

04:54.360 --> 04:57.463
>> Julie: GOOD EVENING.
I'M JULIE CHEN MOONVES.

04:57.530 --> 05:01.501
WELCOME TO EVICTION NIGHT ON
"CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER."

05:01.567 --> 05:04.737
IN LESS THAN TWO HOURS, ONE
OF THE HOUSEGUESTS WILL BE
WALKING

05:04.804 --> 05:09.942
OUT THE FRONT DOOR, BUT WHO
WILL BE SENT PACKING IS
ANYONE'S

05:10.009 --> 05:13.413
GUESS, BECAUSE TONIGHT, THE
VETO COMPETITION WILL PLAY
OUT,

05:13.479 --> 05:18.051
OPENING UP THE CHANCE FOR
THE NOMINATIONS TO CHANGE.

05:18.117 --> 05:20.453
SO WHO WILL WIND UP ON THE
BLOCK?

05:20.520 --> 05:24.457
WHO WILL BE EVICTED?
AND JUST WHAT GAME-ALTERING

05:24.524 --> 05:28.828
SURPRISE AWAITS THE
HOUSEGUESTS WHEN MON WON'S
CURSE IS RELEASED

05:28.895 --> 05:32.765
INTO THE HOUSE?
WE'LL FIND OUT SOON ENOUGH.

05:32.832 --> 05:37.603
BUT FIRST, THE FIRST
NOMINATIONS OF THE SEASON
HAVE BROUGHT TEARS

05:37.670 --> 05:42.041
TO SOME AND CONFUSION TO
OTHERS. BUT THE ONE THING
EVERYONE CAN

05:42.108 --> 05:45.445
AGREE ON: THIS GAME JUST GOT
REAL.

05:45.511 --> 05:53.986
>> THIS NOMINATION CEREMONY
IS ADJOURNED.

05:54.053 --> 05:57.056
I HAVE NOMINATED MIRAI AND
CARSON.

05:57.123 --> 06:00.226
>> ALL RIGHTY, THEN.
>> SHOCKING.

06:00.293 --> 06:05.031
>> MIRAI IS MY PRIMARY
TARGET PAUSE SHE'S A FIERCE
COMPETITOR,

06:05.098 --> 06:08.601
AND, UNFORTUNATELY, SHE'S
PROVEN TO ME SHE CAN'T BE
TRUSTED.

06:08.668 --> 06:14.006
AND I FLOMINATED CARSON AS A
PAWN, BECAUSE EVERYBODY
LOVES

06:14.073 --> 06:17.243
HIM, AND IF THE HOUSE HAD TO
CHOOSE, MIRAI IS GOING HOME.

06:17.310 --> 06:20.713
BUT IF I WANT THE NOMS TO
STAY THE SAME, I'VE GOT TO
WIN THIS

06:20.780 --> 06:27.386
VETO COMPETITION, BECAUSE
THIS FIGHT IS NOT OVER UNTIL
THE BELL

06:27.453 --> 06:29.155
RINGS.
>> I ALREADY KNOW I'M GOING
TO

06:29.222 --> 06:32.258
BE PUT UP ON THE BLOCK.
MIESHA TOLD ME THAT I WAS
GOING

06:32.325 --> 06:36.896
TO BE A PAWN, BUT I'M TRYING
TO, YOU KNOW, LOOK A LITTLE
UPSET

06:36.963 --> 06:40.833
AND MAYBE SLIGHTLY
SURPRISED. I COULD HAVE
RAISED AN EYEBROW

06:40.900 --> 06:44.504
IN SHOCK, I WOULD HAVE.
BUT THESE BABIES DON'T MOVE.

06:44.570 --> 06:49.909
EVEN THOUGH I'VE BEEN
PROMISED SAFETY, I STILL
NEED TO WIN THAT

06:49.976 --> 06:53.346
VETO.
VETO, FROM THE LATIN, "TO
SAVE

06:53.412 --> 06:55.381
ONE'S ASS."
>> YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

06:55.448 --> 06:57.650
>> THANK YOU.
>> MIESHA TOLD ME THAT I WAS

06:57.717 --> 07:00.820
GOING TO BE NOMINATED.
AND AT THIS POINT, I DON'T
KNOW

07:00.887 --> 07:07.193
IF I'M HER PAWN OR HER ALL
TARGET.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.728
TARGET.
BUT AS AN ATHLETE, SOMETIMES
YOU

07:08.795 --> 07:15.301
JUST HAVE TO SMILE, BUT
INSIDE, I'M CRYING AND
SCREAMING AND I

07:15.368 --> 07:19.972
MIGHT LOOK CUTE, BUT I'VE
GOT DEMONS INSIDE ME, TOO,
AND I

07:20.039 --> 07:26.078
KNOW THAT I CAN GROW CLAWS
LIKE NO ONE ELSE CAN.

07:26.145 --> 07:29.982
( BELL RINGS )
>> I MEADE A DEAL WITH
MIESHA

07:30.049 --> 07:33.119
THAT I WOULD NOT BE
NOMINATED OR BACKDOORED THIS
WEEK.

07:33.186 --> 07:36.689
BUT OF COURSE I'M STILL
WORRIED THAT TWO PEOPLE FROM
MY ALLIANCE

07:36.756 --> 07:40.092
ARE ON THE BLOCK.
I'M HOPING THAT MIESHA STAYS

07:40.159 --> 07:45.698
TRUE TO HER WORD, AND I STAY
SAFE THIS WEEK AND NO ONE IN
MY

07:45.765 --> 07:49.535
ALLIANCE GOES HOME.
>> WHERE'S THAT VODKA?

07:49.602 --> 07:53.306
>> I LOVE CARSON OUTSIDE THE
HOUSE, AND I ALSO LOVE
CARSON IN

07:53.372 --> 07:55.775
THIS HOUSE.
AND WE'RE IN THE FORMATION

07:55.842 --> 07:59.812
ALLIANCE TOGETHER WITH
CYNTHIA, SHANNA, TEDDI AND
MIRAI.

07:59.879 --> 08:02.048
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
HONEY.

08:02.114 --> 08:06.018
I'M A "BIG BROTHER"
SUPERFAN. AND I CAME HERE TO
SLAY.

08:06.085 --> 08:10.089
I CAME TO WIN THIS GAME.
OUT OF EVERYBODY IN THIS
HOUSE,

08:10.156 --> 08:13.359
CARSON IS MY NUMBER ONE
COMPETITION SO HIM BEING ON
THE

08:13.426 --> 08:18.097
BLOCK IS NOT ACTUALLY A BAD
THING FOR MY GAME.

08:18.164 --> 08:20.700
SORRY, CARSON.
>> YOU'RE WINNING THE VETO.

08:20.766 --> 08:29.742
>> YES, ABSOLUTELY.
>> L.O.L.

08:29.809 --> 08:30.877
L.O.L.
L.O.L.

08:30.943 --> 08:33.613
I MEAN, THIS IS GAME, RIGHT?
>> YEAH, TOTALLY.

08:33.679 --> 08:38.317
>> THAT WAS A LOT, THOUGH.
>> L.O.L.

08:38.384 --> 08:41.254
L.O.L.
IT JUST...

08:41.320 --> 08:44.156
>> I'M SO SORRY, BABY.
>> IT'S, LIKE, FINE.

08:44.223 --> 08:48.661
>> YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T TAKE
THAT PERSONALLY.

08:48.728 --> 08:50.563
IT'S HARD NOT TO, BUT THAT'S
SHOCKING.

08:50.630 --> 08:59.605
>> IT'S A GAME BUT, LIKE...
>> IT'S ALL GOOD.

08:59.672 --> 09:02.275
>> HOW STRESSFUL WAS THAT?
>> IT WAS HARD.

09:02.341 --> 09:04.944
BUT AT LEAST I FELT GOOD
ABOUT MY CHOICES.

09:05.011 --> 09:09.849
>> AND THAT'S ALL THAT
MATTERS. >> I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU HAVE

09:09.916 --> 09:13.252
CONNECTED THE DOTS YET.
>> I PROBABLY HAVE NOT YET
RIGHT

09:13.319 --> 09:16.289
NOW.
>> SO AS OF RIGHT NOW, MIRAI
IS

09:16.355 --> 09:21.260
THE TARGET.
CARSON IS THE PAWN.

09:21.327 --> 09:27.600
BECAUSE EVERYBODY LOVES
CARSON. I'M HOPING THAT
THEY'LL BE LIKE,

09:27.667 --> 09:31.504
"I LOVE CARSON.
I GUESS I HAVE TO PICK
MIRAI."

09:31.570 --> 09:32.538
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE.
>> YEAH.

09:32.605 --> 09:35.741
>> I WANT TO MAKE SURE MIRAI
GOES HOME.

09:35.808 --> 09:39.345
MY ORIGINAL PLAN TO BACKDOOR
TEDDI TOTALLY BLEW UP IN MY

09:39.412 --> 09:42.648
FACE, AND I'M REALIZING I
HAVE TO BE MORE STRATEGIC IN
WHO I

09:42.715 --> 09:44.083
TRUST.
>> DID YOU EXPLAIN TO CARSON

09:44.150 --> 09:46.252
BEFORE HE WENT UP THAT HE
WAS GOING TO BE A PAWN?

09:46.319 --> 09:49.588
>> UM, I DON'T WANT TO--
>> IT'S FINE, IT'S FINE.

09:49.655 --> 09:52.758
>> TOO MUCH INFORMATION.
>> OKAY, COOL.

09:52.825 --> 09:58.631
>> LOVE YOU.
>> GOT IT.

09:58.698 --> 10:00.366
>> SO, YES, I DID.
>> HE TOOK IT OKAY?

10:00.433 --> 10:04.136
>> HE TOOK IT GREAT.
>> I AM WORKING WITH A LOT
OF

10:04.203 --> 10:07.006
PEOPLE THIS HOUSE, HONEY,
BUT MIESHA IS STARTING TO
BECOME MY

10:07.073 --> 10:09.942
NUMBER ONE.
I HAVE NEVER HAD A CRUSH ON
A

10:10.009 --> 10:13.679
GIRL BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT MIESHA THAT'S GOT ME

10:13.746 --> 10:17.416
QUESTIONING, LIKE, WHAT TEAM
DO YOU PLAY FOR TODRICK.

10:17.483 --> 10:20.419
>> YOU WON'T GO HOME.
IF YOU GO HOME, I FAILED.

10:20.486 --> 10:28.060
>> HE WILL NOT GO HOME.
>> ALL RIGHT.

10:28.127 --> 10:32.598
>> I'M, LIKE, NOT UPSET
ABOUT BEING NOMINATED.

10:32.665 --> 10:35.601
BUT MY STRESS LEVEL IS,
LIKE, A LITTLE BIT HIGH.

10:35.668 --> 10:39.872
>> NO, I UNDERSTAND THAT.
BUT I DON'T THINK YOU'RE
GOING

10:39.939 --> 10:44.877
TO BE THE FIRST TO GO.
I THINK YOU REPRESENT TOO
MUCH.

10:44.944 --> 10:49.015
>> WHO?
>> YOU.

10:49.081 --> 10:53.686
FOR THE AUDIENCE, THE WORLD.
>> IT IS A LOT OF PRESSURE.

10:53.753 --> 10:56.555
>> I DON'T KNOW.
>> I HOPE THAT I CAN STAY

10:56.622 --> 11:00.059
BECAUSE I WANT TO DO MY
COMMUNITY PROUD.

11:00.126 --> 11:04.096
I DIDN'T GROW UP WATCHING
PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE ME IN
THIS

11:04.163 --> 11:06.766
BUSINESS.
AND WE'RE OFTEN OVERLOOKED.

11:06.832 --> 11:09.869
>> YOU CAN BE EMOTIONAL.
REMEMBER, YOU COME FIRST.

11:09.935 --> 11:13.906
>> THANK YOU.
>> THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEONE
WHO

11:13.973 --> 11:21.113
PAVES THE WAY.
IIT IS IMMENSE PRESSURE.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.416
>> IT'S OKAY, IF YOU DON'T
FEEL FINE.

11:23.482 --> 11:26.185
>> YEAH.
>> IT'S OKAY.

11:26.252 --> 11:31.190
.>> THANK YOU.
>> I REALLY LIKE MIRAI.

11:31.257 --> 11:34.560
SHE'S A SWEETHEART.
I CAN'T IMAGINE THE AMOUNT
OF

11:34.627 --> 11:36.529
PRESSURE THAT MIRAI IS GOING
THROUGH RIGHT NOW.

11:36.595 --> 11:42.068
BUT MAYBE THAT PRESSURE IS
EXACTLY WHAT SHE NEEDS IN
ORDER

11:42.134 --> 11:47.673
TO WIN THIS GAME.
>> I THINK, LIKE, A GOOD
NIGHT

11:47.740 --> 11:50.042
OF REST WILL BE NICE.
>> YEAH, MAYBE.

11:50.109 --> 11:57.283
WHATEVER IT TAKES.
>> THANK YOU.

11:57.349 --> 12:00.953
>> ARE YOU-- ARE YOU FINE?
>> YEAH, I'M JUST PROCESSING

12:01.020 --> 12:12.798
EVERYTHING.
>> OKAY.

12:12.865 --> 12:20.272
>> DO YOU THINK SHE KNOWS?
>> YES.

12:20.339 --> 12:26.212
>> I'M JUST SAYING, YOU PUT
TWO PEOPLE UP FROM OUR GROUP
TO

12:26.278 --> 12:31.750
SPLIT US UP.
SO CYNTHIA, TEDDI, TODRICK,

12:31.817 --> 12:35.521
SHANNA, MIRAI AND I ARE ALL
PART OF AN ALLIANCE CALLED
FORMATION.

12:35.588 --> 12:42.094
AND RIGHT NOW, TWO OF US,
TWO, ARE ON THE BLOCK.

12:42.161 --> 12:45.030
>> ONE OF YOU NEEDS TO WIN
THE VETO.

12:45.097 --> 12:55.941
>> I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.
>> YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO

12:56.008 --> 12:58.244
CLOUD YOUR MIND WITH GAME.
I KNOW YOU'VE GOT A CORE.

12:58.310 --> 13:01.113
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW WHERE
I AM IN THAT CORE.

13:01.180 --> 13:07.119
>> YOU'RE IN IT.
>> YEAH.

13:07.186 --> 13:12.691
>> I WILL AM KIND OF FAN
BOYING OUT.

13:12.758 --> 13:15.928
WATCHING MESA TRAINING IS
AWESOME FOR ME BECAUSE I
LOVE

13:15.995 --> 13:20.799
M.M.A.
AS A FELLOW HOUSEGUEST OF
MIESHA

13:20.866 --> 13:35.748
TATE, THIS IS INTIMIDATING.
NOTE TO SELF: DON'T CROSS
MIESHA

13:35.814 --> 13:42.087
TATE, THIS IS INTIMIDATING.
NOTE TO SELF: DON'T CROSS

TATE.

>> MIESHA.

14:08.614 --> 14:13.118
>> WHO DO YOU THINK IS
LEAKING? >> TODRICK
UNDERSTANDS THE GAME.

14:13.185 --> 14:18.057
>> YEAH, BUT I THINK HE'S
VERY LOYAL TO OUR POD.

14:18.123 --> 14:21.727
I'M SO NEW TO THE GAME AND
SO NAIVE, I THINK, NO, IT
CAN'T BE

14:21.794 --> 14:24.496
A LEAK COMING FROM OUR OWN
FORMATION.

14:24.563 --> 14:27.166
THAT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE.
BUT SOME OTHER MEMBERS OF
THE

14:27.233 --> 14:30.869
GROUP THINK MAYBE WE DO HAVE
SOMEBODY LEAKING INFO TO
MIESHA.

14:30.936 --> 14:38.043
THE ONLY ONE THAT I'M
SLIGHTLY CONCERNED ABOUT IN
OUR GROUP IS

14:38.110 --> 14:40.679
MIRAI.
>> THAT'S HOW I FOUND OUT I
WAS

14:40.746 --> 14:46.085
GOING TO GET BACKDOORED.
SHE PULLED ME ASIDE, "SHE'S

14:46.151 --> 14:48.287
TARGETING YOU.
SHE'S GOING TO BACKDOOR
YOU."

14:48.354 --> 14:52.524
>> YOU DON'T THINK SHE'S A
DOUBLE AGENT, DO YOU?

14:52.591 --> 14:55.594
>> WITH US AND MIESHA?
>> YEAH.

14:55.661 --> 14:57.863
>> YES.
>> DO YOU?

14:57.930 --> 15:02.468
>> YES.
WE KNOW WHAT WE'VE GOT TO
DO.

15:02.534 --> 15:06.505
>> DID YOU USED TO WORK FOR
THE C.I.A.?

15:06.572 --> 15:10.376
>> JUST A "REAL HOUSEWIFE."
>> IT SERVEYOU WELL.

15:10.442 --> 15:13.245
>> YOU OR ME, OR SOMEONE IN
THE FORMATION, NEED TO WIN
THE VETO.

15:13.312 --> 15:14.179

>> YEAH.

15:14.246 --> 15:16.215

OR SOMETHING.

15:16.282 --> 15:25.824
>> YEAH.
>> WHAT'S UP WITH YOU?

15:25.891 --> 15:29.428

CHILLING. I'M IN GOOD
SPIRITS.

SHIELD, ESPECIALLY AFTER
I'VE SEEN HOW

H.O.H. COMPETITION.

15:48.881 --> 15:50.749
SHE CAN BE THE BRAWN, AND I
CAN BE THE BRAIN AND THE
FASHION IN

15:50.816 --> 15:52.418

16:03.028 --> 16:07.199
IF MIESHA AND I CAN RIDE
THIS THING UNTIL THE WHEELS
FALL OFF,

16:07.266 --> 16:11.136
TO THE FINAL TWO, I MIGHT
HAVE TO STAY OUT OF
FORMATION AND

16:11.203 --> 16:16.542
STAY REALLY LOYAL TO MIESHA,
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW MY GUT

16:16.608 --> 16:18.711

EITHER

ME, "ARE YOU GOING TO ATTEND
LAMAR

19:23.962 --> 19:27.733

I

19:27.799 --> 19:30.869

26:22.948 --> 26:26.718
EVERYTHING, SO MAKE SURE YOU
HIT ALL YOUR APPEARANCES AT
THE

26:26.785 --> 26:30.355
RIGHT SPOTS SP TIMES, OKAY?
JUST ONE LITTLE THING-- AND

26:30.422 --> 26:35.126
TOTALLY MY BAD-- BUT I
FORGOT TO MAKE YOUR
SCHEDULE.

26:35.193 --> 26:39.030
DAY DRINKING AGAIN!
BUTNO WORRIES, BECAUSE YOU

26:39.097 --> 26:42.934
TEXTED YOU ALL THE "D."
OR AT LEAST THE ONES I
REMEMBER.

26:43.001 --> 26:46.471
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.
ON GO, START SCROLLING
THROUGH

26:46.538 --> 26:49.774
MY TEXTS ON YOUR PHONE.
USE THE EXTREMELY HELPFUL
INFO I

26:49.841 --> 26:54.379
SENT YOU TO FIGURE OUT THE
ORDER YOU NEED TO VISIT EACH
LOCATION

26:54.446 --> 26:58.917
ON MAIN STREET.
PUT THE CLOCK LABELED 1:00
AT

26:58.984 --> 27:03.388
THE FIRST PLACE.
THE CLOCK LABELED 2:00 AT
THE

27:03.455 --> 27:06.458
SECOND AND SO ON UNTIL ALL
THE CLOCKS ARE PLACED.

27:06.524 --> 27:11.463
ONCE YOU THINK YOU HAVE THE
CORRECT ORDER, HIT YOUR
BUTTON.

27:11.529 --> 27:13.465
IF YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'LL HEAR
A DING.

27:13.531 --> 27:16.234
IF YOU'RE WRONG, YOU'LL HEAR
A BUZZER.

27:16.301 --> 27:20.438
IF YOU'RE TOTALLY RUNNING
LATE, I'LL CAL YOU WITH MORE
INFO,

27:20.505 --> 27:22.007
BECAUSE I'M THE BEST
ASSISTANT EVER.

27:22.073 --> 27:25.276
THE FASTEST PLAYER WILL WIN
THE GOLDEN POWER OF VETO.

27:25.343 --> 27:29.014
ARE YOU READY TO PLAY
"SCHEDULED SNAFU?"

27:29.080 --> 27:33.151
>> OH, MY GOD, TOTALLY!
LISTEN, THE ONLY WAY I KNOW
I'M

27:33.218 --> 27:36.654
NOT GOING HOME IS IF I WIN
THIS VETO COMPETITION.

27:36.721 --> 27:43.128
SO NO PRESSURE, BUT... WIN
( BUZZER SOUNDS )

27:43.194 --> 27:46.131
>> OKAY YOU'RE TRYING ON
HATS RIGHT AFTER PILATES.

27:46.197 --> 27:49.134
SO DON'T GET TOO SWEATY.
GOT IT.

27:49.200 --> 27:52.904
YOU'LL BE SIGNING BOOKS AT
THE BOOK STORE EITHER FIRST
OR LAST.

27:52.971 --> 27:54.539
OKAY.
IN THIS COMPETITION, I HAVE
TO

27:54.606 --> 27:58.043
USE CLUES FROM MY ASSISTANT
TO FIGURE OUT MY SCHEDULE
FOR THE

27:58.109 --> 28:00.045
DAY.
AND THEN I PUT THESE CLOCKS
AT

28:00.111 --> 28:02.313
THE RIGHT DESTINATION FOR
WHERE I'M SUPPOSED TO BE.

28:02.380 --> 28:05.683
AND WHOEVER GETS THE CORRECT
ORDER IN THE SHORTEST AMOUNT
OF

28:05.750 --> 28:08.887
TIME WINS THE GOLDEN POWER
OF VETO.

28:08.953 --> 28:13.792
YOU GO IN THERE.
I LOVE A MIND TEASER, SO I
FEEL

28:13.858 --> 28:16.828
LIKE I'M GOING TO BE PRETTY
GOOD AT THIS.

28:16.895 --> 28:19.864
MY STRATEGY IN THIS
COMPETITION IS TO MOVE AS
QUICKLY AS

28:19.931 --> 28:22.067
POSSIBLE.
AND THEN I CAN GO BACK TO MY

28:22.133 --> 28:27.672
PHONE, CHECK THE CLUES, AND
ADJUST AS NEEDED.

28:27.739 --> 28:31.843
"AFTER B.B. BREWERY, YOU'LL
HAVE FOUR HOURS TO SOBER UP
BEFORE

28:31.910 --> 28:37.615
HITTING THE SLOPES, SKIS.
BOTH ARE AT EVEN HOURS."

28:37.682 --> 28:41.319
SO I THINK, WELL, IF I NEED
A FOUR-OUR STRETCH IN
BETWEEN,

28:41.386 --> 28:43.922
LET'S START WITH THE HIGH
EVEN NUMBER, WHICH IS 6.

28:43.988 --> 28:47.459
I PUT THAT AT THE SKI LIFT.
AND THEN I SUBTRACT FOUR
HOURS

28:47.525 --> 28:50.929
FROM THAT, THAT'S 2.
I DON'T NORMALLY EVEN DO
MATH,

28:50.995 --> 28:57.702
BUT I THINK THIS IS GOING TO
WORK.

28:57.769 --> 28:59.571
OKAY...
YOU'RE TRYING ON HATS RIGHT

28:59.637 --> 29:03.575
AFTER PILATES.
SO LET'S SEE... I DON'T KNOW

29:03.641 --> 29:07.011
WHAT CAME OVER ME.
I GRABBED THE 3 AND I PUT
THAT

29:07.078 --> 29:09.247
AT PILATES, BECAUSE THAT'S
HAPPENING BEFORE THE HAT

29:09.314 --> 29:13.518
FITTING.
AND THEN I PUT THE 4 OVER AT
THE

29:13.585 --> 29:16.754
OILEDY HAT HOUSE.
THANK GOD I SPEAK GERMAN.

29:16.821 --> 29:22.460
THAT MEANS HAT HOUSE.
REMIND ME TO FIRE YOU WHEN I
GET

29:22.527 --> 29:27.065
OUT OF HERE.
AFTER THE GONDOLA GALLERY,
GO TO

29:27.132 --> 29:32.036
ONE OF THE OTHER PLACES.
AFTER THAT PLACE, IS
CHAIRLIFT

29:32.103 --> 29:33.605
CAFE.
OH, BOY.

29:33.671 --> 29:36.741
I PLACE THE 5:00 CLOCK AT
THE GONDOLA GALLERY.

29:36.808 --> 29:40.245
THAT'S POSSIBLE.
AND I REALIZE, I NEED TO
HAVE AN

29:40.311 --> 29:44.616
HOUR IN BETWEEN THE GONDOLA
GALLERY AND THE CHAIRLIFT
CAFE.

29:44.682 --> 29:54.359
SO I NEED TO GET THAT 7 AND
PUT IT AT THE CHAIRLIFT
CAFE.

29:54.425 --> 29:58.296
( BELL RINGS )
OH, SWEET!

29:58.363 --> 30:02.667
I'M PRETTY HAPPY WITH
MYSELF. I THINK MY TIME IS
GOOD, BUT I'M

30:02.734 --> 30:05.937
NOT CERTAIN.
AND I STILL DON'T KNOW IF I
WON

30:06.004 --> 30:08.740
THIS COMPETITION AND I CAN
SAVE MYSELF.

30:08.806 --> 30:12.377
ALL I KNOW IS I NEED A NEW
ASSISTANT, AND A SMALLER
PHONE.

30:12.443 --> 30:16.714
( BUZZER SOUNDS ).
>> THE CLUE SAYS THAT I HAVE

30:16.781 --> 30:22.086
FOUR HOURS TO SOBER UP
BEFORE GOING TO SLOPE SIDE
SKIS.

30:22.153 --> 30:24.322
AND BOTH LOCATIONS HAVE TO
BE AT EVEN HOURS.

30:24.389 --> 30:30.962
SO I PLACE THE 2:00 AT THE B
.B. BREWERY, AND THE 6:00 AT
THE

30:31.029 --> 30:33.865
SLOPE SIDE SKIS.
I KNOW THAT I'M TRYING ON
HATS

30:33.932 --> 30:39.604
RIGHT AFTER PILATES, SO I
PLACE THE 3 AT THE PILATES.

30:39.671 --> 30:44.142
THAT LEAVES ME WITH THE 4
:00, AND THE ONLY PLACE IT
CAN GO IS

30:44.209 --> 30:47.579
AT THE HAT HOUSE.
THE NEXT TEXT THEY DECIDE TO

30:47.645 --> 30:53.084
TACKLE IS THAT AFTER I GO TO
THE GONDOLA GALLERY, I GO
SOMEWHERE

30:53.151 --> 30:56.487
ELSE, AND THEN I GO TO THE
CHAIRLIFT CAFE.

30:56.554 --> 31:01.659

DUH!

39:50.654 --> 39:51.789
>> YES!
WORK IT!

39:51.856 --> 39:59.764
>> I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
>> DANG, TODRICK, MAYBE YOU
WERE

39:59.830 --> 40:02.399
RIGHT, CARSON IS A SERIOUS
THREAT IN THIS HOUSE.

40:02.466 --> 40:05.636
NOW THAT CARSON'S WON, I
HAVE TO DECIDE ON A
REPLACEMENT NOMINEE.

40:05.703 --> 40:10.007
IT REALLY SUCKS THAT BY THE
END OF THE WEEK, I WILL HAVE

40:10.074 --> 40:12.409
NOMINATED AROUND 25% OF THE
HOUSE.

40:12.476 --> 40:15.813
THAT MEANS I HAVE TO WORK
EXTRA HARD TO MAKE SURE THAT
MY CREW

40:15.880 --> 40:19.150
IS RIDING WITH ME, BECAUSE I
AM GOING TO HAVE AN EVEN
BIGGER

40:19.216 --> 40:24.922
TARGET ON MY BACK.
>> I KNOW THAT MY GAME IS IN

40:24.989 --> 40:27.858
JEOPARDY.
BUT TEAM U.S.A. TAUGHT ME TO
BE

40:27.925 --> 40:31.428
A GOOD SPORTS MAN.
SO I JUST HOPE THAT WHOEVER

40:31.495 --> 40:36.901
MIESHA DECIDES TO PUT UP ON
THE BLOCK NEXT TO ME IS A
BIGGER

40:36.967 --> 40:43.474
TARGET.
>> HI.

40:43.541 --> 40:46.143
CAN I TALK TO YOU ONE LAST
TIME? >> YEAH.

40:46.210 --> 40:49.480
>> LIKE, I KNOW I HAVE A BIG
TARGET ON MY BACK AT THIS
POINT,

40:49.547 --> 40:54.885
BUT I WOULD LOVE TO STAY,
AND IF I WIN H.O.H. NEXT
WEEK, I WOULD

40:54.952 --> 40:59.323
NOT PUT YOU UP ON THE BLOCK.
>> UM, I'M CURIOUS WHO YOU
WOULD

40:59.390 --> 41:04.528
PUT UP.
>( SIGHS )

41:04.595 --> 41:07.631
>> I NEED YOU TO KNOW THAT
YOU CAN TRUST ME, AND I NEED
TO KNOW

41:07.698 --> 41:11.635
THAT I CAN TRUST YOU.
CAN I TRUST YOU?

41:11.702 --> 41:15.806
>> ABSOLUTELY.
>> I THINK THAT IF YOU WIN

41:15.873 --> 41:20.878
H.O.H., LIKE, I FEEL LIKE I
NEED TO ASK YOU TO TRY TO
MAKE YOUR

41:20.945 --> 41:27.918
TARGET CARSON.
IT'S THE CARSONS WHO WIN
THIS

41:27.985 --> 41:29.820
GAME.
AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE TO
STAY

41:29.887 --> 41:33.357
TOGETHER, OR WE'RE GOING TO
GET PICKED OFF ONE BY ONE.

41:33.424 --> 41:34.825
ALL OF US.
>> UH-HUH.

41:34.892 --> 41:40.397
>> AND THAT'S WHY I THINK IF
YOU STAYED AND YOU SWEAR,
LIKE, THE

41:40.464 --> 41:42.533
LOYALTY TO THE ALLIANCE AT
THIS POINT.

41:42.600 --> 41:47.137
>> I SWEAR.
LIKE, I SWEAR.

41:47.204 --> 41:50.441
>> THEN I THINK THAT YOU
COULD BE A REALLY BIG ASSET.

41:50.507 --> 41:53.577
>> OKAY.
I ABSOLUTELY.

41:53.644 --> 41:56.914
AND THEN WHO WOULD YOU PUT
UP NEXT TO ME?

41:56.981 --> 42:01.619
>> UH...
KATTAN.

42:01.685 --> 42:05.689
RIGHT NOW, I'M THINKING OF
PUTTING UP CHRIS KATTAN.

42:05.756 --> 42:08.192
HE DOESN'T SEEM TO HAVE A
LOT OF CONNECTIONS IN THE
HOUSE, SO I

42:08.259 --> 42:12.596
DON'T THINK ANYBODY WOULD BE
OFFENDED IF I PUT HIM ON THE

42:12.663 --> 42:13.664
BLOCK
( DOORBELL RINGS )

42:13.731 --> 42:14.531
>> COME IN.
>> HI.

42:14.598 --> 42:16.200
>> I LIKE IT.
>> HOW ARE YOU?

42:16.267 --> 42:19.336
>> I WOULD SO WEAR THAT.
>> YOU WOULD?

42:19.403 --> 42:20.871
>> YEAH.
IT'S ACTUALLY PERFECT THAT
YOU

42:20.938 --> 42:24.742
CAME IN HERE.
>> IT IS PERFECT.

42:24.808 --> 42:29.013
>> SHE JUST MADE A REALLY
APPEALING OFFER.

42:29.079 --> 42:33.951
CARSON CRUSHING THAT VETO
COMP MADE ME REALIZE I NEED
TO

42:34.018 --> 42:39.223
STRENGTHEN MY ATHLETE
ALLIANCE. RIGHT NOW, WE ARE
THE ONLY ONES

42:39.290 --> 42:43.694
THAT CAN SAVE MIRAI.
HER BACK IS SO UP AGAINST
THE

42:43.761 --> 42:48.332
WALL THAT IF I CAN LEVERAGE
HER AND RESURRECT HER FROM
THE DEAD,

42:48.399 --> 42:54.204
I'M PRETTY MUCH GUARANTEEING
HER LOYALTY.

42:54.271 --> 42:57.641
>> AND I'M KIND OF ON BOARD
WITH IT, IN EXCHANGE FOR
TRYING TO

42:57.708 --> 43:01.879
SWAY THIS VOTE TO KEEP HER,
SHOULD WE GET H.O.H., SHE

43:01.946 --> 43:07.551
TARGETS CARSON.
>> I WOULD BE ON BOARD FOR

43:07.618 --> 43:09.787
ANYTHING.
I WOULD JUST BEG THAT YOU
NOT GO

43:09.853 --> 43:13.724
DOWN THERE AND SAY ANYTHING.
>> I WOULDN'T, ESPECIALLY,

43:13.791 --> 43:15.659
SHOULD I GET TO STAY.
>> I HAVE A LONG
RELATIONSHIP

43:15.726 --> 43:20.331
WITH CARSON, AND I JUST
DON'T DON'T WANT HIM EVER TO
FEEL,

43:20.397 --> 43:23.968
LIKE, BETRAYED BY ME.
>> THAT MIGHT BE A PLAN WE
HAVE

43:24.034 --> 43:28.806
TO IMPLEMENT.
OH, MY GOSH!

43:28.872 --> 43:41.685
THIS GAME IS SO CRAZY.
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK MIESHA
IS

43:41.752 --> 43:44.755
GOING TO DO?
>> MIESHA CAN'T DO ANYTHING.

43:44.822 --> 43:47.391
MIESHA HAS TO REPLACE CARSON
OPINION CARSON IS GOING TO
USE

43:47.458 --> 43:49.727
THE POWER OF VETO TO TAKE
HIMSELF OFF THE BLOCK.

43:49.793 --> 43:55.065
MIESHA HAS TO NOMINATE
SOMEONE. >> I AM NOT CLOSE
TO HER.

43:55.132 --> 43:57.835
I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT'S IN HER
GAME.

43:57.901 --> 44:01.472
>> SHE GAVE ME HER WORD IT
WASN'T GOING TO BE ME
INITIALLY,

44:01.538 --> 44:07.177
BUT I DON'T KNOW.
>> I KNOW MIESHA HAS TO PUT
UP

44:07.244 --> 44:09.546
ANOTHER REPLACEMENT NOMINEE,
AND IT MAKES ME A LITTLE
NERVOUS

44:09.613 --> 44:12.249
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP
WITH

44:12.316 --> 44:13.350
HER YET.
CYNTHIA IS OUT.

44:13.417 --> 44:15.519
SHE HAS THE BLESSING OF THE
MON WON.

44:15.586 --> 44:20.090
AND TEDDI MADE IT VERY CLEAR
SHE HAS A DEAL GOING ON WITH
MIESHA

44:20.157 --> 44:24.094
AND I KNOW SHE'S SUPER CLOSE
WITH TODRICK, SO THERE ARE
NOT

44:24.161 --> 44:25.996
MANY REPLACEMENTS LEFT.
I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING TO
MAKE

44:26.063 --> 44:30.134
SURE I DON'T END UP ON THE
BLOCK.

44:30.200 --> 44:38.876
IT'S MAKING ME NERVOUS.
>> IF I HAVE TO WALK UP
THOSE

44:38.942 --> 44:41.779
STAIRS ONE MORE TIME
TONIGHT. >> I KNOW, AND YOU
WORKED OUT,

44:41.845 --> 44:45.382
LIKE, 1,000 TIMES.
>> I'M, LIKE, THE LEAST
PERSON

44:45.449 --> 44:46.850
YOU HAD TO BOND WITH.
>> YEAH.

44:46.917 --> 44:50.721
>> I KNOW YOU OBVIOUSLY HAVE
TO PUT UP, LIKE, A
REPLACEMENT.

44:50.788 --> 44:53.023
I DON'T KNOW WHERE YOUR
HEAD'S AT.

44:53.090 --> 44:55.526
EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE HAS A
REALLY GREAT RAPPORT WITH
YOU.

44:55.592 --> 44:57.795
>> THANKS.
>> AND I LOVE THAT AND I
WANT TO

44:57.861 --> 45:01.532
WORK WITH YOU AND I'MING TO
GO IN WHATEVER DIRECTION YOU
WANT.

45:01.598 --> 45:04.835
I'M SUPER WORRIED THAT
MIESHA IS GOING TO PUT ME UP
ON THE BLOCK

45:04.902 --> 45:08.439
AND CARSON USES THE VETO TO
SAVE HIMSELF.

45:08.505 --> 45:10.707
AND FRANKLY AT THIS POINT I
DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE OF MY

45:10.774 --> 45:14.111
ALLIES IS GOING TO HELP ME
OUT. I HAVE ONE BARGAINING
CHIP, AND

45:14.178 --> 45:17.414
THAT IS INFORMATION.
I'M NOT PART OF ANY, LIKE,
MAJOR

45:17.481 --> 45:18.649
ALLIANCE.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT.

45:18.715 --> 45:24.655
AT FIRST IT WAS THE
FORMATION, WHICH WAS CARSON,
CYNTHIA,

45:24.721 --> 45:27.624
TODRICK, ME, AND MIRAI, AND
TEDDI.

45:27.691 --> 45:30.194
THAT WENT TO HELL IN A
HANDBASKET.

45:30.260 --> 45:34.498
NO ONE WAS EVEN WORKING WITH
EACH OTHER.

45:34.565 --> 45:38.302
>> OH, THAT'S VERY
INTERESTING. LOOK, I NEED AS
MANY VOTES AS I

45:38.368 --> 45:43.774
CAN GET ON MY SIDE.
SO IF SHANNA'S WILLING TO
PLAY

45:43.841 --> 45:47.811
BALL, LET'S PLAY.
>> WHAT CAN I DO THAT WOULD
MAKE

45:47.878 --> 45:51.048
YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH
MOVING FORWARD IN THE GAME
WITH ME?

45:51.115 --> 45:56.920
>> I THINK IT'S A MATTER OF,
LIKE, LIKE, NEEDING TO KNOW
IF I

45:56.987 --> 45:58.055
CAN TRUST YOU.
>> SURE.

45:58.122 --> 46:01.859
>> OR ARE YOU GOING TO GO
DOWNSTAIRS AND TELL CYNTHIA,

46:01.925 --> 46:05.129
CARSON, AND TEDDI
EVERYTHING? >> IF YOU WANT
I'LL EVEN BE LIKE

46:05.195 --> 46:08.365
YOUR PLANT.
I'LL, LIKE, FIND OUT STUFF
FOR

46:08.432 --> 46:10.667
US.
IT'S NOT LIKE MY PROUDEST
MOMENT

46:10.734 --> 46:11.869
IN LIFE, YOU KNOW.
>> RIGHT.

46:11.935 --> 46:13.971
>> BUT I'M WILLING TO DO
THAT BECAUSE I WANT TO BE
HERE.

46:14.037 --> 46:17.040
I WANT TO PLAY.
I WANT TO WORK WITH THE
PEOPLE

46:17.107 --> 46:20.043
THAT ARE GOING TO KEEP ME IN
THIS GAME THE LONGEST.

46:20.110 --> 46:24.915
>> I THINK THAT YOU'RE BEING
GENUINE, SO I HOPE I'M RIGHT
IN

46:24.982 --> 46:27.551
THAT AND I WOULD LOVE TO
HAVE YOU BE A PART OF THIS
ALLIANCE.

46:27.618 --> 46:30.254
>> OKAY.
>> AND PUT MY TRUST IN YOU.

46:30.320 --> 46:36.693
>> I WILL NOT REPEAT
ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED IN
THIS ROOM.

46:36.760 --> 46:40.898
>> Julie: SO, CARSON HAS WON
THE VETO, AND WILL SURELY
SAVE

46:40.964 --> 46:44.902
HIMSELF, PUTTING THE
PRESSURE ONCE AGAIN ON HEAD
OF HOUSEHOLD

46:44.968 --> 46:48.906
MIESHA.
PLUS, IT'S TIME TO REVEAL
WHAT

46:48.972 --> 46:52.609
CURSE MON WON'S HAT WILL
CAST ON THE HOUSEGUESTS, AND
A CLUE HAS

46:52.676 --> 46:59.583
BEEN ON THE HAT THE ENTIRE
TIME. >> MON WON!

46:59.650 --> 47:03.320
>> Julie: THEN IT'S THE
FIRST LIVE VOTE AND EVICTION
OF

47:03.387 --> 47:04.922
"CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER."
WHICH FAMOUS HOUSEGUEST WILL

47:04.988 --> 47:07.524
LEAVE TONIGHT?
STAY WITH US.

47:21.438 --> 47:24.408
♪ ♪ ♪
>> Julie: WELCOME BACK TO

47:24.474 --> 47:27.244
"CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER."
IT SEEMS CARSON WILL BE
SAVING

47:27.311 --> 47:31.548
HIMSELF FROM THE BLOCK.
BUT WHO WILL GO UP IN HIS
PLACE?

47:31.615 --> 47:39.122
IT'S TIME TO FIND OUT.
>> ARE YOU GOING TO THE GYM?

47:39.189 --> 47:43.827
>> YEAH.
>> LET'S GO IN.

47:43.894 --> 47:46.530
MIESHA IS GOING TO HAVE TO
NAME A REPLACEMENT NOMINEE
TODAY.

47:46.597 --> 47:49.266
AND EVEN THOUGH CARSON IS
SAFE THIS WEEK, HE JUST
PROVED TO BE

47:49.333 --> 47:52.970
THE BIGGEST THREAT IN THE
GAME. AND I'M THINKING THAT
WE COULD

47:53.036 --> 47:55.672
USE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE
HIM DOWN A NOTCH BY TAKING A
SHOT AT

47:55.739 --> 48:01.812
ONE OF HIS CLOSEST ALLIES.
ENTER TEDDI.

48:01.878 --> 48:07.784
( LAUGHING )
>> SO THE DECISION.

48:07.851 --> 48:11.455
>> I MEAN, MY DECISION WOULD
BE SIMPLE.

48:11.521 --> 48:14.458
IF YOU PUT TEDDI UP, THERE'S
NO WAY SHE'S NOT GOING HOME.

48:14.524 --> 48:17.861
>> YEAH.
>> YOU SEE HOW CLOSE THEY
ARE.

48:17.928 --> 48:21.398
>> I KNOW.
>> I KNOW.

48:21.465 --> 48:24.935
CARSON IS THE QUEEN BEE.
>> I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW, I

48:25.002 --> 48:26.737
KNOW.
>> AND SHE'S HIS NUMBER ONE.

48:26.803 --> 48:34.044
SHE'S THE ONLY FLAPPING WING
( LAUGHS )

48:34.111 --> 48:38.415
YOU TAKE DOWN A DICTATOR,
YOU CUT OFF HER RESOURCES.

48:38.482 --> 48:42.152
I THINK CARSON IS SO
POWERFUL BUT I THINK BETWEEN
THE TWO OF

48:42.219 --> 48:45.389
THEM, IT'S BETWEEN YOU AND I
STAND ITING NEXT TO EACH
OTHER

48:45.455 --> 48:47.758
IN THE COMPETITION.
I HATE PLAYING THIS HARD
THIS

48:47.824 --> 48:51.194
EARLY IN THE GAME, BUT IF
YOU DON'T TAKE DOWN TEDDI,
THE BALL

48:51.261 --> 48:53.230
IS IN THEIR COURT.
AND SHE'LL BE FINE.

48:53.297 --> 48:57.567
SHE'S GOING TO GO HOME TO
HER GORGEOUS KIDS AND HER
SEXY, RICH

48:57.634 --> 49:00.804
HUSBAND.
>> I THINK TODRICK MIGHT BE
ON

49:00.871 --> 49:03.373
TO SOMETHING.
PUTTING TEDDI UP AS MY

49:03.440 --> 49:06.143
REPLACEMENT NOMINEE COULD
REALLY SHAKE UP THINGS IN
THIS GAME.

49:06.209 --> 49:09.446
AS A FIGHTER, IT'S ALL ABOUT
WAITING FOR THE PERFECT TIME
TO

49:09.513 --> 49:10.847
STRIKE.
AND IF I DON'T TAKE THIS
POWER

49:10.914 --> 49:15.552
SHOT NOW, I COULD BE THE ONE
LAID UP ON THE FLOOR.

49:15.619 --> 49:17.721
HONESTLY, I'VE GOT A LOT TO
THINK ABOUT.

49:17.788 --> 49:22.626
THIS IS JUST SO CRAZY.
THIS GAME HAS BEEN SO

49:22.693 --> 49:26.229
DIABOLICAL, AND CHANGING
EVERY SECOND.

49:26.296 --> 49:30.967
LIKE NEVER IN A MILLION
YEARS COULD I HAVE IMAGINED
THAT WE

49:31.034 --> 49:34.171
WOULD BE IN THIS POSITION,
YOU KNOW

49:34.237 --> 49:37.240
( LAUGHING )
>> I REALLY WISH YOU WERE A
GAY

49:37.307 --> 49:41.645
MAN, BECAUSE I WOULD MARRY
YOU, LIKE, RIGHT AWAY.

49:41.712 --> 49:44.614
I THINK YOU'RE THE FIRST
GIRL I'VE EVER HAD A CRUSH
ON.

49:44.681 --> 49:46.516
IT'S SO WEIRD.
>> I LOVE IT.

49:46.583 --> 49:57.127
>> WORD!
>> I'M STILL WEIGHING OUT MY

49:57.194 --> 49:59.429
OPTIONS.
BUT I DECIDED TO PULL TEDDI
INTO

49:59.496 --> 50:04.301
MY ROOM AND GIVE HER A HEADS
UP BECAUSE SHE MIGHT BE
FINDING

50:04.368 --> 50:06.169
HERSELF ON THE BLOCK PRETTY
QUICK.

50:06.236 --> 50:11.041
ALL RIGHT, SO, I DON'T EVEN
KNOW HOW TO EVEN START.

50:11.108 --> 50:17.781
I NEED TO LET YOU KNOW
THAT-- THAT THINGS HAVE
CHANGED.

50:17.848 --> 50:22.319
>> ARE YOU ABOUT TO BACKDOOR
ME? >> I FEEL REALLY BAD
ABOUT THIS,

50:22.386 --> 50:25.088
BUT BASED ON THE INFORMATION
I'VE GATHERED, IT'S THAT
THERE

50:25.155 --> 50:28.525
HAS BEEN A LINE KRAWN IN THE
SAND, AND YOU ARE CLEARLY ON
THE

50:28.592 --> 50:33.764
OTHER SIDE OF IT.
>> I GAVE YOU MY WORD.

50:33.830 --> 50:37.100
>> I KNOW.
>> I WILL NOT--

50:37.167 --> 50:40.070
>> I KNOW.
>> LET ME PLEAD MY CASE.

50:40.137 --> 50:42.706
I JUST DON'T WANT TO GO HOME
FIRST.

50:42.773 --> 50:45.809
>> I UNDERSTAND.
AND I FEEL LIKE EVERYONE
SHARES

50:45.876 --> 50:51.314
THAT FEELING, THOUGH.
I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS
NOT

50:51.381 --> 50:56.420
IDEAL, AND I FEEL GENUINELY
BAD ABOUT THAT.

50:56.486 --> 51:03.794
I WISH THAT I HAD THE
FORESIGHT TO UNDERSTAND THAT
YOU CANNOT

51:03.860 --> 51:06.530
MAKE ANY REAL PROMISES IN
THIS GAME.

51:06.596 --> 51:09.900
LIKE, YOU-- YOU JUST-- YOU
CANNOT.

51:09.966 --> 51:15.405
>> I WISH YOU WOULD HAVE
GIVEN ME A FIGHTING CHANCE,
THEN.

51:15.472 --> 51:19.976
LIKE, TRUTHFULLY, I-- I
TRUSTED YOU IN THE WAY AS A
MOTHER, AS

51:20.043 --> 51:25.415
SOMEBODY I RESPECT.
YOU'VE LOOKED AT ME STRAIGHT
IN

51:25.482 --> 51:28.585
THE FACE, GIVING ME THAT
SELF-ASSURANCE.

51:28.652 --> 51:31.254
>> IN THAT MOMENT, I MEANT
THAT. I REALLY DID.

51:31.321 --> 51:33.123
LIKE, THAT'S-- THAT'S WHAT'S
SO HARD ABOUT THIS.

51:33.190 --> 51:39.863
>> I UNDERSTAND.
BUT I CAN STILL TELL YOU,
WITH

51:39.930 --> 51:42.566
ONE MILLION PERCENT HONESTY,
I WOULD NOT PUT YOU UP.

51:42.632 --> 51:46.470
>> RIGHT, AND IF YOU DO, I
UNDERSTAND.

51:46.536 --> 51:48.839
>>Y DON'T WANT-- I DON'T
WANT TO DO THAT, THOUGH.

51:48.905 --> 51:51.408
>> I KNOW THAT.
>> I DON'T WANT TO PLAY THAT

51:51.475 --> 51:53.977
GAME.
>> DO YOU UNDERSTAND-- I GET
IT.

51:54.044 --> 51:56.746
BUT WE ARE PLAYING A GAME
WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT.

51:56.813 --> 51:58.715
I DON'T WANT TO SEND ONE
PERSON HOME.

51:58.782 --> 52:01.451
BUT I HAVE TO.
OKAY, AND THIS GAME CHANGES
SO

52:01.518 --> 52:06.523
SECOND BY SECOND, THAT I'M
ABOUT TO LOSE MY...

52:06.590 --> 52:08.458
>> WHAT CHANGED?
>> CONVERSATIONS AND

IT'S NOT MY PERSONALITY.

I ALREADY KNEW THAT THIS WAS

52:25.442 --> 52:28.011

YOU'RE MAKING ME VERY
EMOTIONAL. BECAUSE IT IS,
LIKE, A VERY

58:14.457 --> 58:19.996
IMPORTANT TOPIC TO ME.
RACISM IS TAUGHT TO KIDS.

58:20.063 --> 58:22.699
THAT'S WHEN THESE BIASES

AND WE

58:31.307 --> 58:36.546

WE'RE WILLING TO LEARN AND
ACCEPT ALL

58:36.613 --> 58:39.582

ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.
I'M A BLACK MAN.

59:07.410 --> 59:11.047
I'M A PROUD BLACK MAN.
IT'S TOO BAD THAT IN AMERICA

THESE THINGS WITH POLICE
KILLING YOUNG

59:14.918 --> 59:16.352

I DON'T KNOW.

59:16.419 --> 59:18.254

PAST IT.

>> THAT'S NOT--
>> I WOULDN'T LEAD YOU ON.

1:01:11.534 --> 1:01:15.204
>> I THINK MY FEELING ARE
HURT. >> IT MAKES SENSE THAT
YOU WOULD

1:01:15.271 --> 1:01:17.173
BE EMOTIONAL ABOUT IT.
>> SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST
PLAYING

1:01:17.240 --> 1:01:22.278
IT MORE CUT THROAT THAN
OTHERS. >> WELL, I'M VOTING
FOR YOU TO

>> PLEASE, THANK YOU.

1:01:23.446 --> 1:01:26.849
NOW I HAVE TO GO FIND LAMAR.

1:01:26.916 --> 1:01:30.753
>> LAMAR, THE VOTE'S COME
DOWN TO YOU.

1:01:30.820 --> 1:01:32.789
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?
>> THAT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE.

1:01:32.855 --> 1:01:35.258
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

HELLO, HOUSEGUESTS!

1:02:03.086 --> 1:02:06.956

VERY GLAMOROUS.
EVERYONE IS LOOKING GREAT.

<i>( APPLAUSE )</i>
CARSON FOR EVICTION.

1:02:25.708 --> 1:02:28.411

AND, OF COURSE, SAVED
HIMSELF. >> I DID.

1:02:30.680 --> 1:02:34.717

REPLACED BY TEDDI, WHO NOW
SITS NEXT TO

MIRAI ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK.
AND LET US NOT FORGET THAT

1:02:38.788 --> 1:02:44.460
CYNTHIA WAS GIVEN SAFETY
WHEN SHE WOUND UP WITH MON
WON'S

1:02:44.527 --> 1:02:48.831
LATEST MASTERPIECE.
<i>( LAUGHTER )</i>

1:02:48.898 --> 1:02:56.272
>> UH-OH!
>> Julie: THAT'S RIGHT.

1:02:56.339 --> 1:02:58.908
MON WON'S HAT WOULD BE A
BLESSING TO ONE, CYNTHIA,
BUT IT

1:02:58.975 --> 1:03:04.280
WOULD BE A CURSE TO ANOTHER.
YOU WERE ALSO WARNED THAT
COME

1:03:04.347 --> 1:03:09.919
EVICTION NIGHT, EVEN IF YOU
WERE NOT NOMINATED, YOU
COULD STILL

1:03:09.986 --> 1:03:15.925
BE GOING HOME.
MON WON'S HAT HAS GONE FROM
IN

1:03:15.992 --> 1:03:21.397
FASHION TO UP ON THE.
AND IT'S ABOUT TO FIND A NEW

1:03:21.464 --> 1:03:23.966
OWNER.
BUT THIS TIME, BEING THE
LAST

1:03:24.033 --> 1:03:33.609
PERSON TO RECEIVE MON WON'S
HAT IS SOMETHING YOU DON'T
WANT.

1:03:33.676 --> 1:03:35.878
CYNTHIA, PLEASE STAND AT THE
FRONT OF THE ROOM.

1:03:35.945 --> 1:03:40.816
>> OH, MY GOSH!
>> OH, MY GOD!

1:03:40.883 --> 1:03:47.256
>> Julie: NOW, LISTEN UP.
A CLUE TO THE MON WON CURSE
HAS

1:03:47.323 --> 1:03:50.860
BEEN RIGHT UNDER YOUR NOSE
THIS WHOLE TIME.

1:03:50.927 --> 1:03:55.031
I DID HEAR RUMBLINGS THAT
SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE FIGURED
A LITTLE

1:03:55.097 --> 1:04:01.404
BIT OF IT OUT DURING THE
COMMERCIAL BREAK.

1:04:01.470 --> 1:04:05.474
CYNTHIA, THE LOGO ON THE HAT
IS VELCROD ON.

1:04:05.541 --> 1:04:09.845
>> OH, MY GOD!
>> Julie: PLEASE REMOVE
IT...

1:04:09.912 --> 1:04:13.516
>> I NEVER LOOKED AT THAT.
>> Julie: ...TURN IT UPSIDE

1:04:13.583 --> 1:04:15.918

1:04:15.985 --> 1:04:25.161

1:04:25.228 --> 1:04:27.897
HOLD UP THE HAT TO YOUR
HOUSEMATES, AND YES, I HEARD

1:04:27.964 --> 1:04:30.933
SOME OF YOU SAY IT.
AS YOU CAN SEE THE LOGO HAS

1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:39.575
TURNED FROM MON WON TO NOM
NOW. HERE'S HOW THE CURSE
WORKS: JUST

1:04:39.642 --> 1:04:44.046
LIKE BEFORE, YOU WILL PASS
THE HAT FROM ONE HOUSEGUEST
TO

1:04:44.113 --> 1:04:47.416
ANOTHER.
BUT THIS TIME, THE LAST
PERSON

1:04:47.483 --> 1:04:50.620
TO RECEIVE THE HAT--
>> OH, MY GOD.

1:04:50.686 --> 1:04:52.655
>> Julie: ...WILL BE AN
AUTOMATIC NOMINEE.

MELLENCAMP, SHOFS JUST
EVICTED, 5-3, FROM THE "BIG
BROTHER"

1:20:31.793 --> 1:20:33.461
HOUSE.
TEDDI, YOU WORKED THIS GAME!

1:20:33.528 --> 1:20:35.330
>> I TRIED!
I TRIED!

1:20:35.397 --> 1:20:41.203
>> Julie: YOU MUST NEED A
NAP! I MEAN, YOU CAMPAIGNED
SO HARD

1:20:41.269 --> 1:20:44.539
TO STAY IN THIS GAME, AND
EVEN WITH THE LATEST MON WON
CURSE

1:20:44.606 --> 1:20:47.676
TWIST, THEY STILL, FIVE OF
THEM STILL VOTED TO EVICT
YOU.

1:20:47.742 --> 1:20:50.412
WHY DO YOU THINK SO?
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M TRYING
TO

1:20:50.478 --> 1:20:54.182
FIND THE POSITIVE IN THIS,
AND I AM HONORED THAT I AM A
BIG

1:20:54.249 --> 1:20:55.817
ENOUGH THREAT THAT THEY HAD
TO GET ME OUT FIRST.

1:20:55.884 --> 1:20:59.321
>> Julie: WELL, LET ME ASK
YOU, WHO DO YOU FEEL MOST

1:20:59.387 --> 1:21:02.090
BETRAYED BY AT THIS MOMENT
BEFORE I TELL YOU WHO VOTED

1:21:02.157 --> 1:21:05.126
WHICH WAY.
>> I DON'T UPON WHO-- I
MEAN,

1:21:05.193 --> 1:21:09.864
ULTIMATELY, I PROBABLY FEEL
MOST BETRAYED BY TODRICK.

1:21:09.931 --> 1:21:12.701
>> Julie: WHY?
>> BECAUSE HE WAS ORIGINALLY
IN

1:21:12.767 --> 1:21:16.037
MY ALLIANCE HOLDING MY HAND
AT NIGHT BEFORE WE GO TO
BED,

1:21:16.104 --> 1:21:20.242
"WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS!
WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS!"

1:21:20.308 --> 1:21:23.745
MEANWHILE FORMING A
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT
ALLIANCE AND

1:21:23.812 --> 1:21:25.580
CONSPIRING AGAINST ME.
>> Julie: HE WAS ONE OF THE

1:21:25.647 --> 1:21:27.215
FIVE WHO VOTED YOU OUT.
>> YEAH.

1:21:27.282 --> 1:21:30.285
>> Julie: DO YOU RESPECT THE
GAME MOVE AT ALL?

1:21:30.352 --> 1:21:32.921
>> EVERYBODY IS PLAYING
THEIR OWN GAME, BUT I HAD TO
PLAY A

1:21:32.988 --> 1:21:36.992
GAME THAT I COULD GO HOME
ASK LOOK AT MY KIDS IN THE
EYE AND

1:21:37.058 --> 1:21:41.162
SAY MOMMY CAN HER BEST.
>> Julie: THE OTHERS WHO
VOTED

1:21:41.229 --> 1:21:44.299
YOU OUT, LAMAR.
CHRIS KIRKPATRICK.

1:21:44.366 --> 1:21:46.001
MIRAI.
SHANNA.

1:21:46.067 --> 1:21:50.639
>> SHANNA VOTED ME OUT?
WHEW!

1:21:50.705 --> 1:21:52.140
SHE DID ME DIRTY!
I HAD A FEELING.

1:21:52.207 --> 1:21:56.177
I SAID IS TO CHRIS
KIRKPATRICK THIS MORNING.

1:21:56.244 --> 1:21:58.113
>> Julie: WHY?
WHY DID YOU HAVE THAT
FEELING?

1:21:58.179 --> 1:22:01.716
>> I JUST DID BECAUSE
EVERY-- SHANNA WAS HAVING A
DAY WHERE

1:22:01.783 --> 1:22:04.386
SHE WAS REALLY WORRIED SHE
WAS GOING TO GO HOME, AND
SHE WENT

1:22:04.452 --> 1:22:06.988
UP AND TOLD ME SHE CRIED TO
MIESHA.

1:22:07.055 --> 1:22:11.159
AND I HAD A FEELING IN THAT
MOMENT, OKAY, SHE WENT AND
MADE

1:22:11.226 --> 1:22:13.295
SOME DEAL TO GET ME OUT OF
THERE.

1:22:13.361 --> 1:22:16.531
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT?
I STILL-- I LIKE HER AS A

1:22:16.598 --> 1:22:18.767
PERSON.
AND SHE DID WHAT SHE HAD TO
DO,

1:22:18.833 --> 1:22:20.902
I GUESS.
>> Julie: WHO IS PLAYING THE

1:22:20.969 --> 1:22:23.438
BEST GAME SO FAR, IN YOUR
OPINION?

1:22:23.505 --> 1:22:27.609
>> BEST GAME PLAYER SO
FAR... I DON'T KNOW.

1:22:27.676 --> 1:22:30.512
PROBABLY LAMAR.
LIKE, HE'S ACTING LIKE
HE'S--

1:22:30.578 --> 1:22:34.582
HE'S LIKE, "I DON'T CARE."
BUT I FEEL LIKE HE'S A DARK

1:22:34.649 --> 1:22:37.252
HORSE.
OR I FEEL LIKE... MAYBE
KATTAN,

1:22:37.319 --> 1:22:39.721
SLEEPING HIS WAY THROUGH IT.
>> Julie: I DON'T KNOW.

1:22:39.788 --> 1:22:44.359
I DON'T KNOW.
WE ALWAYS SAY "EXPECT THE

1:22:44.426 --> 1:22:46.528
UNEXPECTED," THIS SEASON
MORE THAN USUAL, I WOULD
SAY.

1:22:46.594 --> 1:22:53.234
ALL RIGHT, TRUTH: WHAT IS
MORE CUTTHROAT BEING A "REAL
HOUSE

1:22:53.301 --> 1:22:57.038
WIFE IN BEVERLY HILLS," OR A
REAL HOUSEGUEST ON "BIG

1:22:57.105 --> 1:22:58.740
BROTHER."
>> A REAL HOUSEGUEST ON

1:22:58.807 --> 1:23:00.608
"CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER."
THIS IS THE HARDEST THING I
HAVE

1:23:00.675 --> 1:23:03.778
EVER DONE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.
BUT ALSO THE MOST FUN.

1:23:03.845 --> 1:23:06.381
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW HARD I
LAUGHED.

1:23:06.448 --> 1:23:08.316
>> Julie: DID YOU MAKE ANY
FRIENDS FOR LIFE IN THERE?

1:23:08.383 --> 1:23:11.553
>> I THINK I DID.
I THINK I DID.

1:23:11.619 --> 1:23:21.329
I THINK I AM SO GRATEFUL FOR
THE RELATIONSHIPS I MADE
EVEN IF ONE

1:23:21.396 --> 1:23:24.199
OF THEM VOTED AGAINST ME.
>> Julie: FINAL THOUGHTS,

1:23:24.265 --> 1:23:25.433
TEDDI?
>> THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.

1:23:25.500 --> 1:23:28.269
AND I LOVE MY FAMILY SO
MUCH. I CAN'T WAIT TO HUG
AND KISS

1:23:28.336 --> 1:23:29.437
YOU.
THANK YOU, CBS.

1:23:29.504 --> 1:23:31.506
THANK YOU, JULIE.
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

1:23:31.573 --> 1:23:35.944
>> Julie: SO DO YOU.
THANKS FOR PLAYING THIS
GAME,

1:23:36.010 --> 1:23:37.212
HARD, VERY IMPRESSIVE.
>> THANKS.

1:23:37.278 --> 1:23:40.815
>> Julie: STAY RIGHT THERE.
I HAVE TO READ THE PROMPTER.

1:23:40.882 --> 1:23:45.954
STAY RIGHT THERE.

HOUSE WITH TEDDI MELLENCAMP,
I'M JULIE CHEN MOONVES.

1:24:33.868 --> 1:24:41.843
LOVE ONE ANOTHER.
GOOD NIGHT.

1:24:41.910 --> 1:24:44.813
HAD.
>> SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN--

1:24:44.879 --> 1:24:48.082
>> LIKE, SHE GAVE ME-- IT
WAS BRUTAL.

1:24:48.149 --> 1:24:53.488
LIKE, SHE GAVE ME THE
GNARLIEST LOOK.

1:24:53.555 --> 1:24:56.291
IF LOOKS COULD KILL, I WOULD
BE DEAD RIGHT NOW.

1:24:56.357 --> 1:25:00.161
>> SED TEDDY?
>> NO, TEDDI KNEW.

1:25:00.228 --> 1:25:01.763
CYNTHIA.
I TOLD THEM--

1:25:01.830 --> 1:25:04.966
>> THEY EXPECTED YOU TO VOTE
TODD OUT OVER TEDDI?

1:25:05.033 --> 1:25:06.668
>> UH-HUH.

1:25:06.734 --> 1:25:09.170
>> YEAH.
>> IS ANYONE IN THERE?

1:25:09.237 --> 1:25:12.674
>> BUT IT WOULDN'T HAVE
MATTERED.

1:25:12.740 --> 1:25:15.043
EVEN IF WE VOTED, YOU WOULD
HAVE VOTED HER OUT.

1:25:15.109 --> 1:25:17.512
>> I PROMISED HER.
>> WE DIDN'T GET 10 MINUTES
TO

1:25:17.579 --> 1:25:19.547
SAY THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GOING
TO DO.

1:25:19.614 --> 1:25:22.784
WE COULD HAVE PROTECTED YOU.
WE COULD HAVE MADE IT A TIE

1:25:22.851 --> 1:25:24.886
VOTE.
YOU WOULD HAVE STILL BEEN
GOOD

1:25:24.953 --> 1:25:27.989
WITH THAT SIDE OF THE HOUSE
AND YOU COULD HAVE VOTED HER
OUT,

1:25:28.056 --> 1:25:33.761
RIGHT?
>> BECAUSE IF I DON'T,
THEN--

1:25:33.828 --> 1:25:39.534

ALL, BY VOTING THE WAY WE
WERE

1:25:39.601 --> 1:25:42.003
