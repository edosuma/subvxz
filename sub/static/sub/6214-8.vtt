WEBVTT

00:02.971 --> 00:04.029
You know what we need?

00:04.206 --> 00:06.504
All-purpose cleaner
that doesn't burn a hole in the ozone.

00:06.675 --> 00:08.802
Oh, they should just sew
that thing up already.

00:08.977 --> 00:11.445
Okay, but it will take a lot longer
to get tan.

00:11.613 --> 00:14.878
Look, with our hectic schedules,
we really need a maid.

00:15.050 --> 00:17.018
Morgan, we are three,
healthy, strong young women.

00:17.185 --> 00:19.676
We are perfectly capable
of cleaning up after ourselves.

00:19.855 --> 00:21.220
Oh, really?

00:21.389 --> 00:23.084
Then, why did you go out
and buy that dress?

00:23.258 --> 00:25.624
I, well, I, uh...

00:25.794 --> 00:28.319
I ran out of clean clothes.
All right, we need a maid.

00:28.497 --> 00:29.759
You know, I'll chip in for one,

00:29.931 --> 00:32.161
but all I can focus on now
is my Joey Skye interview.

00:32.334 --> 00:33.528
Who is this Joey Skye?

00:33.702 --> 00:35.795
He's this great singer
I discovered at the Lush Room.

00:35.971 --> 00:37.632
I'm heading down there now,
you wanna come?

00:37.806 --> 00:39.671
- Uh, no thanks.
Me neither.

00:39.841 --> 00:41.331
I thought you worked
at a hip magazine.

00:41.510 --> 00:43.774
Why are you interviewing
some old crooner?

00:43.945 --> 00:46.743
Joey Skye is 23 and gorgeous.

00:47.482 --> 00:49.848
I'll take a quick shower,
then I'll be right down.

00:50.018 --> 00:53.647
Well, I did shave my legs.
It's a shame to let them go to waste.

00:54.789 --> 00:57.690
Oh, pizza does not look good wet.

01:00.428 --> 01:02.157
- Amanda, is that you?
- Yeah.

01:02.330 --> 01:04.958
I've been so bored, I thought
I would hang out with someone cool.

01:05.132 --> 01:07.294
Oh, well, I'm kind of busy right now.

01:07.836 --> 01:10.202
Actually, I was talking about Salem.

01:10.372 --> 01:11.396
Hey, little buddy.

01:13.108 --> 01:14.132
This place is smokier

01:14.309 --> 01:16.573
than the bathroom
in an all-girls school.

01:16.745 --> 01:18.610
Yeah, what's
with the flashy entrance?

01:18.780 --> 01:21.010
I mean, you may think coming
in here in smoke looks cool,

01:21.183 --> 01:22.343
but it's a disgusting habit.

01:22.517 --> 01:25.645
Ugh, yeah, well remind me to start
listening again when the PSA is over.

01:25.820 --> 01:28.550
You're right, I'm not your mother.
I shouldn't tell you what to do.

01:28.723 --> 01:31.851
Oh, but put your hair back.
Why hide such a beautiful face?

01:32.027 --> 01:33.790
Sabrina, are you okay?

01:33.962 --> 01:35.429
We smell smoke.

01:36.298 --> 01:38.129
Uh, I burned some toast.

01:38.300 --> 01:40.632
All right, I gotta to work.
Help yourself to some leftovers.

01:40.802 --> 01:42.827
And, uh, the soup of the day
is cream of pizza.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:07.382 --> 03:10.010
I can't believe you didn't tell us
Avril Lavigne was gonna be here.

03:10.185 --> 03:11.948
I didn't know,
she stopped to hear Joey's set.

03:12.120 --> 03:13.747
Hey.
- Hi.

03:13.922 --> 03:16.891
Hi, so am I gonna have to guess?
Which one of you is Sabrina?

03:17.058 --> 03:18.252
I am.

03:18.426 --> 03:21.088
I'm Sabrina, and these are my friends,
Single and Desperate.

03:21.763 --> 03:22.787
Have a seat.

03:22.964 --> 03:25.455
- Actually, this is Roxie and Morgan.
- Nice to meet you.

03:25.633 --> 03:27.658
So, uh, what do you wanna know?

03:29.237 --> 03:31.000
That was Avril.

03:31.172 --> 03:32.366
She's headed for the bathroom.

03:32.540 --> 03:35.304
I'm gonna ask her to sign
my napkin.

03:35.777 --> 03:38.803
Oh, Roxie, please go with her and
keep her from crawling under the stall.

03:38.980 --> 03:41.505
Right, we don't need a repeat
of the Aretha Franklin incident.

03:43.651 --> 03:45.243
So, uh,
what do you wanna talk about?

03:45.420 --> 03:47.945
Okay, uh, well, when did you
first start performing?

03:48.122 --> 03:49.453
First time, uh, let's see.

03:49.624 --> 03:51.148
I sang, "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"

03:51.326 --> 03:53.351
at my godmother's birthday,
I was 3.

03:53.528 --> 03:55.860
That's so cute and a better choice
than "Itsy Bitsy Spider. "

03:56.030 --> 03:57.463
I mean between the bugs
and the rain.

03:57.632 --> 03:59.122
No wonder kids stay inside
and get fat.

04:00.068 --> 04:02.127
So, uh, what's your favorite kind
of music to sing?

04:02.303 --> 04:03.395
I would have to say ballads.

04:03.571 --> 04:06.768
Songs that express that one emotion
that's more powerful than anything.

04:06.941 --> 04:09.273
- Anger.
- Love.

04:09.444 --> 04:10.468
- Love.
- Yeah.

04:10.645 --> 04:14.240
Oh, you know, I guess it's been a while,
and I'm angry about it.

04:15.483 --> 04:17.075
So, uh,
where will be you singing next?

04:17.252 --> 04:19.550
- Here.
- No, I mean after tonight?

04:19.721 --> 04:22.815
- Here.
- But what about any upcoming gigs?

04:22.991 --> 04:25.084
Joey, you're next.

04:25.260 --> 04:28.195
Uh, Sabrina, this is Mickey Brentwood,
the owner of the club.

04:28.363 --> 04:29.694
Oh, very nice to meet you.

04:29.864 --> 04:33.197
- Joey tells me you're a reporter.
- Yes, I am.

04:33.368 --> 04:37.031
I don't like people who ask a lot
of questions like that Alex Trebecka.

04:37.205 --> 04:40.197
It's Alex Trebek,
and technically he asks answers.

04:40.608 --> 04:42.667
I don't like people
who correct me, either.

04:43.344 --> 04:45.812
This conversation is over.

04:45.980 --> 04:47.538
Joey, let's go.

04:48.149 --> 04:49.480
Break a leg.

04:50.151 --> 04:51.516
Annie, do you remember Joey Skye,

04:51.686 --> 04:53.551
the new singer
I've been wanting to write about?

04:53.721 --> 04:57.282
Well, since you told me yesterday,
and I'm not an idiot, yes.

04:57.458 --> 05:00.291
Last night, when I asked about singing
at other clubs, he got weird.

05:00.461 --> 05:02.520
Then the owner of the club
had a stare down with me.

05:02.697 --> 05:05.165
- I'm a blinker, so I lost.
- The point?

05:05.333 --> 05:07.198
I think there might be something
going on there.

05:07.368 --> 05:09.529
I mean, he's a great singer,
and he sells the club out.

05:09.704 --> 05:12.901
But, I think it's weird
that he doesn't sing anywhere else.

05:13.074 --> 05:15.338
All right, check it out but be careful.

05:15.510 --> 05:18.411
Nightclub owners can get rough,
so you wanna take someone with you.

05:18.580 --> 05:21.048
Annie, are you saying you and I
should hang out together?

05:21.816 --> 05:23.681
Not if we were conjoined
at the sternum.

05:24.786 --> 05:26.913
So you're busy.
Maybe some other time.

05:27.088 --> 05:30.251
Sabrina, I couldn't help but hear,
because I was eavesdropping.

05:30.425 --> 05:32.586
But just so you know,
I am an Eagle Scout.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.694
And I am more than willing
to be your bodyguard.

05:35.129 --> 05:36.960
- Well, Leonard...
- Hey, check out these guns.

05:37.131 --> 05:38.189
Come on, touch them.

05:38.366 --> 05:41.199
Oh, I would, but I think there's
a seven-day waiting period.

05:41.369 --> 05:42.495
Thanks for the offer.

05:42.971 --> 05:44.996
Fine, but, uh, just so you know,

05:45.173 --> 05:48.142
I spent three months as part
of a very tough street gang.

05:48.309 --> 05:49.503
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:49.677 --> 05:52.840
<i>I was understudy for Riff
in West Side Story.</i>

05:55.216 --> 05:56.478
Pow!

05:59.721 --> 06:02.246
Let's talk about the laundry.
We use the biodegradable detergent.

06:02.423 --> 06:04.891
It doesn't get rid of stains,
but I feel better about it.

06:05.059 --> 06:06.856
Morning, Roxie. Well, who is this?

06:07.028 --> 06:09.895
This is our new cleaning lady, Tatiana.
She's Ukrainian.

06:10.064 --> 06:13.898
Tatiana, what a pretty name,
for someone so...

06:14.068 --> 06:15.433
...squat.

06:16.704 --> 06:17.932
How do you do?

06:18.106 --> 06:19.266
Dust, then laundry.

06:19.440 --> 06:21.271
Oh, cute.

06:21.442 --> 06:24.036
I hired someone too.
I found her name on a flyer.

06:25.413 --> 06:27.904
In fact, that's probably her
right now but...

06:28.082 --> 06:32.610
Don't you worry, I will tell Kim
that the job is already taken.

06:34.088 --> 06:36.420
<i>Mi mess es su mess.</i>

06:42.263 --> 06:44.857
Hi, I'm Kim of Kim's Cleaning.

06:46.501 --> 06:48.401
Tatiana, you're fired.

06:49.170 --> 06:51.400
In the future,
please don't call me at the club.

06:51.572 --> 06:52.596
- Why not?
- Because.

06:52.774 --> 06:54.241
- Because why?
- Because.

06:54.409 --> 06:56.172
Okay, can we throw in
some verbs and nouns.

06:56.577 --> 06:58.977
So, um, tell me about your relationship
with Mickey Brentwood.

06:59.147 --> 07:01.240
It's fine.
What else do you wanna know?

07:01.416 --> 07:03.941
Well, what if you sang somewhere
other than the Lush Room?

07:04.118 --> 07:06.484
- Next question.
- Are you forced to sing exclusively?

07:06.654 --> 07:08.554
- Would you pass the salt, please?
- Pass the...

07:08.723 --> 07:09.951
Oh, is that code?

07:10.825 --> 07:13.316
Yeah, it's code for
I need salt on my fries.

07:14.896 --> 07:16.454
Okay, how about this?

07:16.631 --> 07:19.225
If you're being forced to sing
at the Lush Room, nod your head.

07:22.070 --> 07:23.469
Is that nodding or eating?

07:23.638 --> 07:25.731
Oh, my gosh,
are you being forced to eat too?

07:27.608 --> 07:29.508
Okay, how about we try
something else. Uh...

07:29.677 --> 07:30.701
If you were ketchup

07:30.878 --> 07:34.075
and you wanted to leave mustard
to go across town to salt and pepper...

07:34.248 --> 07:36.773
Not the little sassy hip-hop duo,
these little guys,

07:36.951 --> 07:37.975
what would happen?

07:42.490 --> 07:44.321
- Oh.
- Now you get it?

07:44.492 --> 07:45.891
Yeah, I feel so bad for you.

07:46.060 --> 07:48.255
I mean, not to mention the busboy.

07:48.429 --> 07:50.693
I can't believe you're being threatened.
That's so unfair.

07:50.865 --> 07:52.765
You should be free
to sing wherever you want.

07:52.934 --> 07:55.061
Joey, you have to let me
write this up.

07:55.236 --> 07:56.328
Okay.

07:56.504 --> 07:59.098
Okay, but you have to promise me,
you didn't hear this from me.

07:59.607 --> 08:01.438
My lips are sealed.

08:01.609 --> 08:04.373
First, I'm gonna finish these fries,
but then my lips are so sealed.

08:12.153 --> 08:15.611
If you print that story,
you'll never work again.

08:15.790 --> 08:17.951
You know what I'm saying,
blonde person?

08:20.728 --> 08:23.959
Yeah, you're saying
you had onions for lunch.

08:27.268 --> 08:28.826
Why is it so hot in here?

08:29.003 --> 08:31.267
Morgan, you have it set on 95.

08:31.439 --> 08:33.464
I really didn't notice.

08:34.375 --> 08:35.636
Ah, Kim, Kim.

08:35.809 --> 08:38.370
Don't forget to dust
the top of the drapes.

08:38.546 --> 08:41.275
- No problem.
I can't believe you.

08:41.448 --> 08:44.782
What? I am watching
a professional at work.

08:44.952 --> 08:46.112
And believe me,

08:46.287 --> 08:48.551
your Soviet shot-putter
couldn't have reached up there.

08:48.723 --> 08:50.315
All I'm saying is...

08:50.491 --> 08:52.015
Whoa,
he got the gunk out of the remote.

08:52.193 --> 08:54.218
We can watch in English again.

08:55.296 --> 08:56.558
So it turns out Mickey Brentwood

08:56.731 --> 08:59.063
is forcing Joey to only sing
at the Lush Room.

08:59.233 --> 09:00.894
And Mickey is the guy
who threatened you?

09:01.636 --> 09:03.501
Are you sure you wanna go ahead
with this story.

09:03.671 --> 09:05.730
Absolutely, it's an incredible scoop.

09:05.907 --> 09:07.169
Oh, I don't like this.

09:07.341 --> 09:09.036
You've been threatened
by a nightclub owner.

09:09.210 --> 09:10.404
Don't you watch HBO?

09:11.379 --> 09:13.847
What are you saying?
I'm gonna be sleeping with the fishes?

09:14.015 --> 09:15.448
Wearing a cement overcoat?

09:15.616 --> 09:17.914
Have a boulder dropped on me
from an overpass?

09:18.085 --> 09:20.110
<i>- Wait, that's from The Road Runner.
- Okay, fine.</i>

09:20.288 --> 09:22.779
But if Wile E. Coyote
tries to flatten you with an Acme anvil,

09:22.957 --> 09:25.187
don't come running to me.

09:28.629 --> 09:30.062
Hey, wanna join me

09:30.231 --> 09:32.756
for an emergency trip to Paris
for silver hooped earrings?

09:32.934 --> 09:35.801
Uh, no, thanks, it already feels
like a French bistro in here.

09:35.970 --> 09:37.403
Besides, I'm working on an article.

09:37.572 --> 09:41.474
- Ugh. Snooze.
Actually, not for a change.

09:41.642 --> 09:45.942
You see, this thug nightclub owner
threatened our Lois Lame over here...

09:46.113 --> 09:47.580
No.

09:47.748 --> 09:50.239
I hate it when you cut me off.

09:50.852 --> 09:52.581
It's a bad time, you go ahead.

09:52.753 --> 09:55.620
It's always a bad time for you.
Au revoir.

09:55.790 --> 09:56.814
Please don't do the...

09:58.192 --> 09:59.955
- Smoke. Ugh.

10:00.127 --> 10:02.288
That kid should come
with a warning label, gross.

10:02.463 --> 10:06.126
Speaking of gross,
headless cat at 4 o'clock.

10:09.103 --> 10:10.934
Sorry, but I don't want Amanda
knowing anything

10:11.105 --> 10:13.005
about this situation
with Mickey Brentwood.

10:13.174 --> 10:15.608
Ah, so you are worried?

10:15.776 --> 10:17.243
I have nothing to worry about.

10:17.411 --> 10:20.107
If you don't believe, we'll take
a trip to the future, I'll prove it.

10:20.281 --> 10:21.839
Cool, road trip.

10:33.327 --> 10:35.454
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

10:35.630 --> 10:40.260
But apparently in the future,
you have a bad den.

10:41.135 --> 10:44.298
Uh-oh.
I think someone we know dies.

10:44.472 --> 10:46.667
Oh. Whoa.

10:46.841 --> 10:48.934
When he said,
"You'll never work again,"

10:49.110 --> 10:51.408
he meant not even part-time.

10:54.917 --> 10:56.350
Let me get this straight.

10:56.519 --> 10:58.384
You were excited
about the article this morning,

10:58.554 --> 10:59.782
now you don't wanna write it.

10:59.955 --> 11:02.355
It's not that I don't wanna write it.
It's just that, uh...

11:02.525 --> 11:04.755
This is kind of
a left-brain type article.

11:04.927 --> 11:08.192
I happened to sleep on my left side
last night, so that side is numb.

11:08.364 --> 11:10.594
Now the right side is feeling
bitter and neglected...

11:10.766 --> 11:12.734
Can't you just call in sick
like normal people?

11:12.902 --> 11:14.767
Well, that would be
a left-brain function so...

11:14.937 --> 11:16.734
Stop. I'll assign it to someone.

11:16.906 --> 11:17.930
Great.

11:18.107 --> 11:19.233
No, not great, very bad.

11:19.408 --> 11:22.309
Look, I can't put this off
on someone else, I'll write the article.

11:22.478 --> 11:24.810
Fine, but you and all your little voices
better get to work.

11:24.980 --> 11:28.507
This issue is going to press tomorrow,
so you are on hard deadline, missy.

11:28.684 --> 11:29.981
I'll line up a photo shoot.

11:30.619 --> 11:31.916
Two words I did not need to hear:

11:32.087 --> 11:33.452
Dead and shoot.

11:33.622 --> 11:36.022
I'm not too crazy
about missy, either.

11:36.191 --> 11:39.854
Hey, Leonard, I think I'll take you up
on that bodyguard offer.

11:40.029 --> 11:42.657
Oh, terrific.
You can call me anytime you want.

11:42.831 --> 11:43.855
I really appreciate it.

11:44.033 --> 11:46.968
You know, just not mornings
between 8 and 9:15, I hit the gym.

11:47.136 --> 11:49.570
And mid-day is bad,
I usually have a lunch.

11:49.738 --> 11:52.639
- And not nights after 10.
- Why not?

11:52.808 --> 11:56.073
- Well, I'm bathing Nana.
- Please tell me Nana's your dog.

11:56.245 --> 11:58.213
It's 6:30, what's he still doing here?

11:58.380 --> 12:00.610
The sink needed plunging.

12:00.783 --> 12:02.512
I guess there's a clog in the drain.

12:04.086 --> 12:05.314
This was stuck in there.

12:05.821 --> 12:09.621
Oh, I was wrong, it wasn't a clog.
It was a pump.

12:09.792 --> 12:12.989
Listen, Morgan, before I go, you know
how you were staring at me all day?

12:13.162 --> 12:14.891
Mm-hm.
- Oh, no, here we go.

12:15.064 --> 12:16.827
Sexual harassment works both ways,
you know.

12:16.999 --> 12:19.399
I was wondering, would you be
interested in going out with me?

12:19.568 --> 12:22.196
I have to work tomorrow,
but maybe we can do lunch?

12:22.371 --> 12:25.397
- Sounds fantastic.
- Great.

12:26.508 --> 12:29.204
Ah. Sexual harassment.

12:29.378 --> 12:30.606
Like a fox.

12:32.481 --> 12:34.346
Are you crazy?

12:34.516 --> 12:36.108
You found out
you're gonna get bumped off,

12:36.285 --> 12:38.276
and you're still writing this article?

12:38.787 --> 12:41.847
Look, I'll worry about my article,
you worry about coyotes.

12:45.127 --> 12:46.992
Will you stop with the smoke?

12:47.162 --> 12:48.891
And don't you have
an alchemy final tomorrow?

12:49.064 --> 12:51.157
Whoa, who died
and made you my boss?

12:51.333 --> 12:53.528
Funny you should mention dying.

12:53.702 --> 12:55.670
- Salem.
- What?

12:55.838 --> 12:57.499
Okay, something weird is going on.

12:57.673 --> 12:59.231
I think you should tell her.

12:59.408 --> 13:02.605
You know, so someone could call
the police besides the cat.

13:02.778 --> 13:05.440
All right, it's possible
that there's some connection

13:05.614 --> 13:08.879
between writing this story
and my untimely youthful death.

13:09.051 --> 13:10.882
Oh, I love those earrings.
Are they from Paris?

13:11.053 --> 13:12.418
Wait a minute, you're going to die?

13:12.588 --> 13:16.581
Hey, Sabrina, if you bite the dust,
can I have your red silk robe?

13:16.759 --> 13:19.159
It makes me feel like a pretty kitty.

13:19.328 --> 13:21.159
You can't write that article, Sabrina.

13:21.330 --> 13:23.924
Oh, I'll be fine.
It's nothing to worry about.

13:24.099 --> 13:27.694
But you'll be dead and buried,
a corpse, worm food.

13:27.870 --> 13:29.895
Okay, when you put it like that,
it is a downer.

13:30.072 --> 13:32.563
Look, if you're hell-bent
on writing this piece,

13:32.741 --> 13:34.470
at least protect yourself.

13:34.643 --> 13:35.905
Change the names.

13:36.078 --> 13:37.409
No, I can't do that.

13:37.579 --> 13:39.513
I'm gonna tell the truth
because I'm a journalist.

13:39.682 --> 13:42.879
And a real journalist
uses real names.

13:43.052 --> 13:46.385
- You changed the names.
- I had to, to protect my sources.

13:46.555 --> 13:49.615
So our sources will be safe,
but our readers will be bored.

13:49.792 --> 13:53.387
Oh, well, we don't want to distract
from the ads, do we?

13:53.562 --> 13:56.122
Well, I'll print it,
but only because I gotta fill the space.

13:56.298 --> 13:57.697
But I am not happy.

13:58.133 --> 14:01.864
You don't understand.
I had to change the names.

14:02.037 --> 14:03.800
I think.

14:05.340 --> 14:09.003
<i>By using pseudonyms instead
Will I end up alive or dead</i>

14:15.984 --> 14:18.350
Well, at least,
my coffin is microwave safe.

14:18.520 --> 14:20.420
So he plans on killing me anyway?

14:20.589 --> 14:22.318
Well, he doesn't know
who he's dealing with.

14:22.491 --> 14:25.255
Annie, print the article
with the real names.

14:25.728 --> 14:28.128
- Are you sure?
- Yes, do it before I change my mind.

14:29.565 --> 14:31.556
Don't do it. Yes, do it, go.

14:31.734 --> 14:33.167
Start the presses.

14:34.536 --> 14:36.197
Flower delivery, my lady.

14:36.371 --> 14:39.135
It looks like you have a secret admirer,
besides me.

14:39.808 --> 14:42.299
Oops. Now, it's not a secret.

14:43.112 --> 14:44.511
Black roses?

14:45.080 --> 14:48.481
"I hope you like this arrangement,
don't forget ours. Mickey. "

14:49.184 --> 14:51.243
Are you in some kind of trouble?

14:51.420 --> 14:53.650
Uh, Leonard, I never thought
I would say this but, um...

14:53.822 --> 14:55.881
Do you wanna come home
with me tonight? Ha, ha.

14:56.525 --> 14:57.890
Tonight? Ahem.

14:58.060 --> 15:01.086
Uh. Oh, I can't, it's, uh...

15:01.263 --> 15:05.757
Whew. Uh, spinning class.
You know, I'll be too dizzy.

15:05.934 --> 15:08.903
Okay, well, any other secret admirers
want to come home with me tonight?

15:10.339 --> 15:12.864
Uh, any professional wrestlers?

15:13.375 --> 15:15.969
Thai kickboxers?

15:16.145 --> 15:18.636
Anyone with super-hero pajamas?

15:19.081 --> 15:20.810
"... and so,
due to this immoral contract,

15:20.983 --> 15:23.918
the only place that uber-talented
Joey Skye will see his star rise

15:24.086 --> 15:26.384
is over the Lush Room. "

15:26.555 --> 15:28.113
I hope you know what you're doing.

15:28.290 --> 15:30.781
I do, except for that "uber" thing.

15:30.959 --> 15:32.756
Wow, speaking of uber thing,
who is that?

15:32.928 --> 15:34.862
That's our new maid.

15:35.030 --> 15:36.224
Morgan's dating the help?

15:37.166 --> 15:39.066
Oh, now it makes sense.

15:39.234 --> 15:41.668
Well, thanks for lunch.
See you around.

15:41.837 --> 15:43.805
Oh, all right. Oh, wait.

15:43.972 --> 15:45.940
You have some dirt
under your right nail, hold on.

15:46.575 --> 15:48.099
Oh, thanks again, bye-bye.

15:48.277 --> 15:51.474
Oh, but you have some schmutz
on your face, I'll get it.

15:52.047 --> 15:55.107
You know, while I'm here,
I would love to work on these pores.

15:55.284 --> 15:57.115
Oh, that is it, get out.

15:57.286 --> 15:59.413
- Can't we make a plan for next time?
- No, we can't.

15:59.588 --> 16:01.317
You are too obsessed
with your work.

16:01.490 --> 16:03.788
You're the only guy who has asked me
to take off my clothes

16:03.959 --> 16:04.983
so he could iron them.

16:05.160 --> 16:06.889
Goodbye.

16:08.263 --> 16:11.664
Roxie, get me the name
of that squat uranium lady.

16:16.071 --> 16:18.301
I was so worried about you, Sabrina.

16:18.473 --> 16:20.168
I don't want you to die.

16:20.342 --> 16:21.934
Don't worry, nobody's dying.

16:22.110 --> 16:23.372
Some of us are choking.

16:23.545 --> 16:25.012
I'm really worried about you.

16:25.681 --> 16:27.808
Look, I can keep Mickey Brentwood
from knocking me off.

16:27.983 --> 16:30.850
I'll just lay low and stay out
of dangerous situations.

16:31.019 --> 16:32.486
I'll be fine, really.

16:33.956 --> 16:35.617
You wanna sleep over?

17:04.486 --> 17:06.545
That's it, I'm getting dressed
and going down there.

17:06.722 --> 17:08.848
I'm not gonna let
that thug intimidate me.

17:12.493 --> 17:13.518
What's going on?

17:13.694 --> 17:15.185
Amanda, it's time to face my fears.

17:15.364 --> 17:17.332
I'm going to the Lush Room
for a sit-down with the enemy.

17:17.499 --> 17:19.729
Ha. Not without me.
Hang on, I'll get dressed.

17:19.902 --> 17:22.462
Well, make it fast,
because I wanna get right down there

17:22.637 --> 17:26.540
and tell that ignorant swaggering goon
that he better back off.

17:26.974 --> 17:29.705
But, I'll tell Mickey Brentwood
that he's absolutely charming.

17:29.878 --> 17:33.245
Sabrina, you've done me
a great dishonor by printing this.

17:35.450 --> 17:39.682
Look, I'm really sorry, but I had to.
Joey Skye's a very talented singer.

17:39.855 --> 17:43.484
I mean, the Lush Room is lovely
and the cider is to die for, so to speak,

17:43.659 --> 17:45.456
but holding him back is so wrong.

17:45.627 --> 17:47.720
You're trying to ruin me, aren't you?

17:47.896 --> 17:49.329
You're gonna ruin me.

17:49.498 --> 17:50.863
No, I'm not trying to ruin anybody.

17:51.033 --> 17:53.558
I just think Joey should be
free to live his own life.

17:53.735 --> 17:56.260
It's very tough out there.
They'll eat him alive.

17:56.438 --> 17:57.598
Oh, like you care about that.

17:57.773 --> 17:59.604
He's your cannoli ticket,
you big meatball.

17:59.775 --> 18:01.538
- Meatball?
- Sorry, I'm hungry.

18:01.710 --> 18:03.610
I'm just trying to protect him,
that's all.

18:03.779 --> 18:05.178
Oh, what are you, his mother?

18:05.347 --> 18:06.678
Uh, I mean, his father?

18:08.083 --> 18:09.482
Oh, my gosh, you are his father.

18:09.651 --> 18:11.380
Why doesn't he tell people
you're related?

18:11.553 --> 18:14.886
Because I talk funny or something.
Maybe he's embarrassed.

18:15.057 --> 18:18.686
Oh, don't cry,
or I'll be embarrassed of you too.

18:18.860 --> 18:21.488
- Here.
- Oh, thank you very much.

18:21.663 --> 18:24.063
What's the worst that can happen
if he sings at other clubs?

18:24.232 --> 18:25.426
He'll desert me.

18:25.600 --> 18:29.092
You know, he'll go to his fancy
schmancy auditoriums.

18:29.271 --> 18:34.538
<i>He'll get a record deal.
He'll go on that MTVPlugged Up.</i>

18:34.710 --> 18:37.975
- Those are good things.
- Okay, okay.

18:38.146 --> 18:41.411
I'm afraid he'll forget about his papa.

18:41.583 --> 18:43.448
Mickey, you can't let your fears
run your life.

18:43.618 --> 18:45.984
I mean, sure,
Joey will probably go out on his own.

18:46.154 --> 18:49.419
But he'll come back and visit
for weekends and national holidays.

18:49.591 --> 18:52.617
You think? I hope so.

18:52.794 --> 18:56.127
This was good, I feel much better.
Thank you very much.

18:56.298 --> 18:59.825
And, uh,
now, what can I do for you?

19:00.002 --> 19:02.027
Uh, please don't kill me?

19:02.504 --> 19:03.732
What is that?

19:03.905 --> 19:08.171
You think I would hurt someone
so beautiful?

19:08.343 --> 19:10.004
I would hope not. Ha, ha.

19:10.512 --> 19:13.140
Thanks for the tissues.

19:16.385 --> 19:20.116
Hey, someday
you're gonna get married,

19:20.288 --> 19:23.951
and I'm gonna give you
a very good rate on my big room, okay?

19:24.126 --> 19:26.526
I'm a softie.

19:26.695 --> 19:29.061
Hey, open the car door.
I'm coming out.

19:29.231 --> 19:31.756
Why are you just standing around?

19:32.467 --> 19:35.095
Nice guy, taught me a lot.

19:36.905 --> 19:39.533
Okay, let's go down to that club
and witch-slap this guy.

19:39.708 --> 19:41.369
Oh, we don't have to go.
He was just here.

19:41.543 --> 19:43.306
What? What happened?
Are you okay?

19:43.478 --> 19:46.208
I'm fine, it's all taken care of.
He won't be bothering me anymore.

19:46.381 --> 19:47.973
Oh, I'm so relieved.

19:48.150 --> 19:50.311
We should make it a point
to hang out more often,

19:50.485 --> 19:52.180
not just when one of our lives
is at stake.

19:52.354 --> 19:53.514
Yeah, I would like that.

19:53.688 --> 19:56.213
Far be it from me
to break up this love fest,

19:56.391 --> 19:58.552
but you still don't know
how you died.

19:58.727 --> 20:01.218
I don't die anymore.
I changed my destiny.

20:01.396 --> 20:03.887
Mickey likes me now.
I'm getting married in the big room.

20:04.066 --> 20:05.761
Yeah, but what if Salem's right?

20:05.934 --> 20:08.232
Look, relax, I'll ping us
into the future and show you.

20:17.712 --> 20:21.307
All this time and I didn't
even know she was a smoker.

20:21.483 --> 20:23.781
She wasn't.
Didn't you hear what the doctor said?

20:23.952 --> 20:25.385
No.

20:25.887 --> 20:29.050
Although I did notice,
he wasn't wearing a wedding ring.

20:29.224 --> 20:31.556
Morgan, she died
of second-hand smoke.

20:31.726 --> 20:34.286
But we don't smoke.

20:34.463 --> 20:36.556
It must have been someone
from work.

20:37.899 --> 20:40.026
Or from somewhere else.

20:40.202 --> 20:42.693
I am so sorry.
No more smoke, I promise.

20:42.871 --> 20:44.338
Good.

20:44.506 --> 20:46.201
I hate to see you like this.

20:47.209 --> 20:49.507
Hey, don't forget I'm half mortal,
but I'm also half witch.

20:49.678 --> 20:52.476
So it could be centuries
before I actually die.

20:52.647 --> 20:56.276
But when I do, promise not to bury me
with my bra strap showing?

21:01.724 --> 21:04.659
It's very hot in here.
You mind if I take shirt off?

21:05.127 --> 21:06.924
- No.
- No.

21:17.440 --> 21:18.805
It's just not the same, is it?

21:19.475 --> 21:21.136
- Nope.
- No.
