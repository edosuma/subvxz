00:04.768 --> 00:08.768
Through all history big brothers
have been torturing their little brothers.

00:08.879 --> 00:11.494
But sometimes, little bothers
get the upper hand.

00:11.611 --> 00:12.674
Give me back my guitar!

00:12.795 --> 00:15.739
No. I wont it playing
air hockey fair and square.

00:15.877 --> 00:17.481
What? (Scoffs)
But you don't even use it!

00:17.603 --> 00:18.971
That's not true.

00:19.709 --> 00:21.321
I use it to store
my post-its.

00:21.430 --> 00:22.467
(Laughs) Wow.
You know?

00:22.587 --> 00:25.325
I'm bigger and stronger than you,
so I could just take it back...

00:25.453 --> 00:29.762
You take it back and I'll tell all your
friends that I beat you in air hockey.

00:35.167 --> 00:37.414
I like this wire the best.

00:38.948 --> 00:40.732
It's a string!

00:42.989 --> 00:43.922
T-minus one day

00:44.039 --> 00:45.910
until the "Planet Nowhere"
book releases.

00:46.033 --> 00:47.097
Now that we're
in the home stretch,

00:47.219 --> 00:49.105
I'll be switching
to hourly updates.

00:49.222 --> 00:50.450
Brick, enough
with the reminders.

00:50.581 --> 00:52.341
Your dad said
he was gonna take you.

00:52.457 --> 00:53.947
You're not the most
reliable people.

00:54.078 --> 00:55.474
Oh, and don't forget
my costume.

00:55.598 --> 00:58.856
I just need a furry hat
and gloves that look like rocks.

00:58.976 --> 01:01.186
And obviously, of course,
a pointy nose.

01:01.300 --> 01:02.916
Wouldn't want
to look like an idiot.

01:03.303 --> 01:07.090
Brick, I need to see you
in my room right away.

01:07.203 --> 01:09.854
It's <i>muy importante.</i>

01:12.642 --> 01:14.269
(Lowered voice)
Okay, as I'm sure you know,

01:14.411 --> 01:16.382
it's mom and dad's
anniversary coming up.

01:16.502 --> 01:17.872
It's their 20th!

01:17.985 --> 01:19.672
(Singsongy) So what are
we gonna do for them?

01:19.795 --> 01:21.260
We've lit up their lives
every day.

01:21.381 --> 01:22.359
What more do they want?

01:22.469 --> 01:23.860
I want to throw them
a big surprise party,

01:23.991 --> 01:25.498
like you guys did for me.

01:25.622 --> 01:27.614
You guys got me so good.
Remember?

01:27.708 --> 01:28.727
Hmm.

01:29.067 --> 01:30.654
Sue, I'm gonna be busy reading.

01:30.788 --> 01:32.370
The seventh and final
"Planet Nowhere" book

01:32.504 --> 01:33.495
comes out tomorrow.

01:33.613 --> 01:35.168
I've been reading these books
for over half my life--

01:35.320 --> 01:36.223
six years!

01:36.347 --> 01:38.437
It's all been building up
to this final book.

01:38.579 --> 01:40.607
You guys, it's their 20th.

01:40.725 --> 01:43.109
Hey, I have an idea.
How 'bout we blow this one off

01:43.228 --> 01:44.921
and really hit it hard
for their 40th?

01:45.042 --> 01:48.001
Axl, there might not <i>be</i> a 40th.
They're getting older.

01:48.123 --> 01:49.588
They might be dead by then.

01:49.708 --> 01:50.309
(Gasps)

01:50.415 --> 01:51.839
- Oh, my God.
- Sue, get a grip.

01:51.966 --> 01:52.710
Okay, look--

01:52.819 --> 01:54.349
let's just figure out
who's doing what.

01:54.490 --> 01:56.093
Invitations?

01:56.658 --> 01:58.364
I'll do those. Food?

01:58.519 --> 02:01.152
I got it.
How about finding a venue?

02:01.271 --> 02:04.007
That's more of a me job.
Tell you what--

02:04.126 --> 02:06.983
how 'bout you guys
just work on the skit, okay?

02:07.138 --> 02:08.352
- Can we go?
- Whatevs.

02:08.476 --> 02:10.966
Okay. But let's all leave
the room at different times.

02:11.098 --> 02:13.137
And everybody act normal.

02:14.170 --> 02:15.699
(Whispers) Raise no suspicion!

02:16.722 --> 02:18.036
So that's why
I think he'll concentrate

02:18.166 --> 02:20.235
more on the Silligans,
who live in the outer rings,

02:20.376 --> 02:22.344
but we haven't heard from them
since book four,

02:22.453 --> 02:24.034
so who knows?

02:24.151 --> 02:25.411
Certainly not me.

02:25.534 --> 02:27.079
Okay, I'll start
at the beginning.

02:27.235 --> 02:28.695
- Hmm.
- So there's this planet

02:28.832 --> 02:30.839
that exists
outside of time and space,

02:30.974 --> 02:32.890
its future rested
solely on the whims

02:33.004 --> 02:35.107
of the mighty
dwarf warrior Gallantra.

02:35.239 --> 02:37.824
Wow.
Your 20th anniversary.

02:37.945 --> 02:39.415
That's a really big deal,
Frankie.

02:39.536 --> 02:40.839
A really, really big deal.

02:40.945 --> 02:42.160
Oh, I don't know.
People get so nuts.

02:42.284 --> 02:44.107
It's just one year
later than the 19th.

02:44.233 --> 02:46.150
Still, glad you made me
buy him a card.

02:46.270 --> 02:47.233
(Laughs)

02:47.361 --> 02:48.911
(Indistinct conversations)
Ooh, what's going on here?

02:49.057 --> 02:50.316
I bet it's a book signing.

02:50.431 --> 02:52.563
This is where I got
Joy Behar's autograph.

02:52.688 --> 02:55.443
Have you read "Joy Shtick"?
I'll lend you my copy.

02:55.584 --> 02:57.931
No, they're releasing the last
"Planet Nowhere" book today.

02:58.052 --> 03:00.061
Actually, Mike and Brick
should be in line somewhere.

03:00.173 --> 03:01.863
Oh, I see 'em.
There they are.

03:01.978 --> 03:05.444
(Gasps) Aw.
Look how cute Mike is.

03:05.558 --> 03:07.032
He really is cute, isn't he?

03:07.144 --> 03:08.684
You know what?
I'm gonna call him

03:08.778 --> 03:09.830
and tell him I see a cute guy

03:09.936 --> 03:11.609
standing in line at the bookstore.
(Laughs)

03:11.710 --> 03:13.524
(Dials cell phone)
You two are adorable.

03:13.652 --> 03:15.129
(Laughs) (Cell phone rings)

03:16.309 --> 03:17.489
(Ring)

03:17.687 --> 03:18.982
(Beep)

03:20.000 --> 03:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:30.099 --> 03:32.626
They're taking Soran
and Ramale to the Outer Rings!

03:32.748 --> 03:34.900
The Outer Rings! I knew it!
<i>(Tv playing indistinctly)</i>

03:35.000 --> 03:35.791
Hello.

03:35.902 --> 03:37.296
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:37.406 --> 03:39.509
Did you happen to get
a phone call from me today?

03:39.664 --> 03:41.269
Uh...

03:41.389 --> 03:43.010
Oh, yeah. I guess I did.

03:43.168 --> 03:44.780
Probably didn't hear it ring.

03:44.888 --> 03:46.339
Oh, really?

03:46.928 --> 03:47.545
(Tv turns off)

03:47.659 --> 03:49.438
Well, I happened to be
walking by the bookstore,

03:49.547 --> 03:51.045
and I saw you
look at your phone,

03:51.166 --> 03:52.270
see it was me,

03:52.366 --> 03:54.032
and then shove me back
into your pocket

03:54.101 --> 03:55.468
with your change and your lint.

03:55.578 --> 03:57.113
Nancy Donahue saw it, too.

03:57.241 --> 03:59.130
Yeah. It was
kind of embarrassing.

03:59.253 --> 04:00.519
So you're mad

04:00.639 --> 04:03.372
because Nancy Donahue
<i>saw</i> me not take your call?

04:03.475 --> 04:06.363
No. I'm mad because
after 20 years,

04:06.482 --> 04:08.454
my husband no longer
wants to speak to me.

04:08.587 --> 04:10.446
You know, it's our 20th
anniversary, Mike.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.789
That's a really big deal.
A really big deal!

04:12.903 --> 04:14.048
Come on, Frankie.

04:14.156 --> 04:16.572
You-- you never get tired
and don't feel like talking?

04:16.697 --> 04:19.668
No. My husband calls,
I pick up the phone.

04:19.841 --> 04:21.278
What if it had been
an emergency?

04:21.403 --> 04:22.546
Was it an emergency?

04:22.658 --> 04:24.916
No. For your information,

04:25.046 --> 04:27.213
I was calling
to tell you you were cute.

04:27.355 --> 04:29.421
See, that's the problem
with cell phones.

04:29.525 --> 04:31.281
It's created a world
where people call you

04:31.409 --> 04:35.211
just... with whatever thought
pops into their head.

04:35.427 --> 04:38.160
What I do is, I actually
remember the interesting things

04:38.281 --> 04:39.242
that happen during the day,

04:39.353 --> 04:41.664
and then I share them
when I get home.

04:41.756 --> 04:44.534
If you think about it,
that's... much more thoughtful.

04:44.651 --> 04:46.719
Oh, I see. So you ignoring
my phone calls

04:46.853 --> 04:48.689
is actually
you being thoughtful?

04:48.812 --> 04:50.209
I'm just saying
there's two sides.

04:50.328 --> 04:52.780
No, there's not.
There's one very mean side.

04:52.934 --> 04:54.669
And you know what?
Now that I'm looking at you,

04:54.821 --> 04:56.579
I'm glad you didn't answer.

04:56.700 --> 04:58.554
'Cause you're not that cute...
at all.

04:58.670 --> 05:00.630
You're actually kind of old.

05:01.126 --> 05:02.663
(TV turns on)

05:04.676 --> 05:06.426
Has anyone seen
my "Planet Nowhere" book?

05:06.560 --> 05:08.522
I set it down on the air hockey
table for a second

05:08.646 --> 05:09.939
because my eyes
were starting to cramp,

05:10.058 --> 05:11.943
- and now it's gone.
- Wow.

05:12.085 --> 05:14.102
- That is weird.
<i>- You.</i>

05:14.243 --> 05:15.684
You stole my book!

05:15.879 --> 05:17.656
Brick, there's only one reason
I'd steal your book,

05:17.779 --> 05:19.229
and that would be
to draw boobs on it.

05:19.321 --> 05:20.096
And if I did that,

05:20.219 --> 05:21.648
I would obviously
show it to you.

05:21.752 --> 05:23.290
This is all about
the guitar, isn't it?

05:23.445 --> 05:25.708
You just couldn't stand
the fact that I had your guitar,

05:25.798 --> 05:27.030
so now you took my book.

05:27.151 --> 05:29.003
Mom, tell Axl
to give me back my book.

05:29.144 --> 05:31.053
You can find your book
after dinner.

05:31.160 --> 05:32.615
I was gonna read it <i>at</i> dinner.

05:32.721 --> 05:35.516
Well, I guess now you're just
gonna have to interact.

05:35.678 --> 05:37.532
(Mouth full) So, Mike,

05:37.678 --> 05:40.278
I can't wait to hear about
all the interesting things

05:40.434 --> 05:43.549
that happened today that you've
been saving up to share.

05:43.673 --> 05:45.431
Everybody be quiet. Shh.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.123
Your dad's gonna talk.

05:47.329 --> 05:48.892
You have the floor.

05:50.721 --> 05:53.247
As a matter of fact,
there was something interesting.

05:53.367 --> 05:54.625
Today was Dave's birthday,

05:54.739 --> 05:56.799
so a couple ladies in
bookkeeping threw him a party.

05:56.914 --> 05:57.924
Eep!

05:58.166 --> 05:59.813
Yeah. He was
pretty surprised.

05:59.921 --> 06:05.178
(High-pitched whine)

06:08.986 --> 06:10.846
Oh, my God.
That was so close.

06:10.967 --> 06:13.585
(Breathing deeply) Oh, God.
When dad said "surprised,"

06:13.706 --> 06:15.401
I totally thought
they were onto us.

06:15.549 --> 06:17.698
You know, I don't know
how you guys kept it together.

06:17.808 --> 06:19.813
Where's my book, Axl?
I know you took it.

06:19.944 --> 06:21.347
Hey!
Until I see some proof,

06:21.462 --> 06:23.339
I will not even address
these malicious

06:23.454 --> 06:25.153
and spurious charges!

06:25.232 --> 06:26.359
"Law & Order." Watch it.

06:26.481 --> 06:28.645
- Axl!
- Shh!

06:28.975 --> 06:29.763
(Toilet flushes)

06:29.874 --> 06:30.880
(Whispering)
Will you guys be quiet?

06:30.995 --> 06:33.004
They're almost
onto us as it is!

06:33.181 --> 06:34.737
(Jiggles handle)

06:34.840 --> 06:35.832
(Gurgling) (Gasps) Oh, my God!

06:35.954 --> 06:38.085
Oh! It's coming up!
It's coming up!

06:38.204 --> 06:40.387
Stop! Where are you going?
I need your help!

06:40.508 --> 06:42.701
<i>While Sue plunged deeper</i>
<i>into party planning,</i>

06:42.813 --> 06:45.349
<i>Brick continued his</i>
<i>increasingly desperate search.</i>

06:45.460 --> 06:47.421
(Axl chuckles)

06:47.541 --> 06:49.483
Looking for this?
(Chair creaks)

06:49.601 --> 06:50.370
I knew it.

06:50.445 --> 06:52.375
I knew you took it.
Give it back right now.

06:52.484 --> 06:53.866
Unh-unh-unh. Mm.

06:53.987 --> 06:55.750
Since you've been raving
so much about this book,

06:55.865 --> 06:57.430
I decided to read it
for myself.

06:57.529 --> 07:00.171
Not the whole thing, of course.
Just the last chapter.

07:00.374 --> 07:03.115
(Inhales sharply)
Wanna know how it ends?

07:03.240 --> 07:05.160
<i>What?</i> No.

07:05.328 --> 07:07.218
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

07:07.315 --> 07:08.476
(Singsongy) Pretty juicy.

07:08.578 --> 07:10.344
Please, Axl, please don't
tell me the ending.

07:10.462 --> 07:13.363
I've spent six years of my life
waiting to see how it ends!

07:13.472 --> 07:14.837
I don't know.
It's just so good.

07:14.942 --> 07:15.974
I gotta tell somebody.

07:16.063 --> 07:18.035
You can have the guitar back.
It's all yours!

07:18.138 --> 07:20.346
Eh, I don't want
the guitar anymore.

07:20.455 --> 07:21.780
I'm kinda into reading now.

07:21.889 --> 07:24.229
Please, Axl.
Come on. Just...

07:24.859 --> 07:26.669
Just give me the book back.

07:28.022 --> 07:29.692
Yeah, okay. (Chuckles)

07:30.646 --> 07:31.858
(Exhales deeply)

07:32.590 --> 07:33.597
Thank you.

07:33.752 --> 07:35.155
Professor Faxon has been dead
the whole time.

07:35.271 --> 07:37.076
- No!
- The Seventh Circle only exists

07:37.204 --> 07:38.464
in Professor Faxon's mind!

07:38.609 --> 07:39.529
No!

07:39.642 --> 07:41.701
Planet Nowhere is just Earth
four million years ago!

07:41.825 --> 07:43.665
<i>No!</i>

07:44.249 --> 07:45.797
(Thud) (Gasps and groans)

07:45.896 --> 07:47.193
Oh!

07:47.692 --> 07:49.008
(Sighs)

07:51.018 --> 07:52.401
Brick?

07:55.362 --> 07:56.943
I think I killed Brick!

08:05.081 --> 08:06.571
(Exhales)
Oh, my God. Still?

08:06.688 --> 08:08.507
It's been two days.
Now you're just milking it.

08:08.614 --> 08:10.583
You're making me feel like
this is somehow my fault.

08:11.115 --> 08:12.448
Fine. Be a baby.

08:12.573 --> 08:13.846
I'm just saying,
you should eat something,

08:13.964 --> 08:15.619
'cause it's not healthy.

08:18.490 --> 08:20.974
<i>Our 20th anniversary</i>
<i>was just 2 days away.</i>

08:21.077 --> 08:22.641
<i>Did I really</i>
<i>want to be fighting?</i>

08:22.764 --> 08:24.887
<i>I figured</i>
<i>Mike had suffered enough.</i>

08:24.982 --> 08:27.803
Mike, I'm sorry I--

08:29.022 --> 08:30.479
Mike?

08:31.433 --> 08:33.121
<i>(TV playing indistinctly)</i>

08:33.236 --> 08:36.136
Hey. What is this?
What are you doing?

08:36.292 --> 08:37.974
(Mouth full) Nothing.
Just having a steak.

08:38.096 --> 08:40.099
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

08:40.229 --> 08:41.893
Frankie, don't get
all worked up.

08:41.994 --> 08:43.825
I just-- I mean,
first the phone call,

08:43.937 --> 08:45.247
and now this--
I don't believe this.

08:45.349 --> 08:46.307
It's no big deal.

08:46.418 --> 08:48.074
Oh, it is so a big deal.

08:48.204 --> 08:51.254
So what? You just come here
and eat steak?

08:51.376 --> 08:53.818
You just sit here
and eat without me?

08:53.974 --> 08:55.204
Yeah, sometimes.

08:55.886 --> 08:57.134
Sometimes?

08:57.270 --> 08:59.040
You've done this before?

08:59.132 --> 09:00.537
It's quiet. I like it.

09:00.812 --> 09:03.732
So you're saying you can't
enjoy yourself during the day?

09:03.851 --> 09:05.186
No. Can you?

09:05.319 --> 09:07.867
Well...
I just think it's rude.

09:07.996 --> 09:10.505
You're having fun in the middle
of the night without me.

09:10.638 --> 09:12.417
You're cheating on me with fun.

09:12.539 --> 09:14.514
(Laughs) Frankie, come on.

09:14.614 --> 09:16.456
You make a big deal
of the smallest things.

09:16.580 --> 09:18.946
It's a freezer-burned steak.
Here, you want a bite?

09:19.050 --> 09:20.513
No, I don't want a bite.

09:20.618 --> 09:22.467
I want to be invited
by my husband

09:22.605 --> 09:24.020
to have dinner with him.

09:24.121 --> 09:26.029
You know, this is worse
than an affair.

09:26.188 --> 09:28.603
(Chuckles) - What?
- Yeah. I could understand

09:28.736 --> 09:30.717
if there were someone prettier
or younger than me.

09:30.835 --> 09:33.522
But you're more interested
in nobody.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.746
That hurts.

09:35.953 --> 09:37.059
It's a steak.

09:37.171 --> 09:38.799
I was hungry.
I made a steak.

09:38.968 --> 09:42.155
You know, I was rolling over
to say "I'm sorry."

09:42.273 --> 09:44.225
I was about to apologize.

09:44.334 --> 09:46.296
You know, I think
it's really convenient

09:46.419 --> 09:49.253
that you're always "about to"
do something really nice

09:49.399 --> 09:52.423
<i>just</i> before I do something
you blame me for.

09:52.532 --> 09:54.155
Well, by the way,

09:54.297 --> 09:56.431
I wasn't rolling over
to apologize.

09:56.535 --> 10:00.433
I was rolling over
to <i>apologize.</i>

10:03.304 --> 10:05.394
Should have
picked up that phone.

10:05.834 --> 10:06.443
(Bicycle bell dings)

10:06.558 --> 10:08.983
- Hey, Grandpa Big Mike.
- What are you doing here?

10:09.123 --> 10:11.713
Did you get my message about
my parents' anniversary party?

10:11.920 --> 10:13.350
Oh, I doubt it.

10:13.482 --> 10:15.953
None of my answering machines
are working.

10:16.074 --> 10:18.793
Oh, well, it's next Tuesday,
and there's gonna be

10:18.922 --> 10:21.217
tons of speeches
and toasts and stuff,

10:21.343 --> 10:23.797
and I was wondering if you might
have some stories about them

10:23.920 --> 10:25.626
that you'd like to <i>share?</i>

10:25.780 --> 10:27.419
No, thanks.

10:27.752 --> 10:28.831
Really?

10:29.112 --> 10:31.565
What about the first time
you met my mom?

10:31.684 --> 10:33.105
Well... (Clicks teeth)

10:33.192 --> 10:34.675
She seemed nice enough,

10:34.789 --> 10:37.240
and I said, "are you really
going to marry this guy?"

10:37.361 --> 10:38.652
And she said, "yeah."

10:38.774 --> 10:41.303
And I said, "all right."

10:41.531 --> 10:42.556
(Chuckles)

10:44.980 --> 10:46.847
You looking for more?

10:47.461 --> 10:51.180
<i>She was, but she wasn't</i>
<i>getting it from Big Mike.</i>

10:51.793 --> 10:53.357
Why are we meeting
in mom and dad's room?

10:53.486 --> 10:54.423
Because this is the last place

10:54.545 --> 10:56.496
mom and dad would ever
expect us to be. Oh!

10:56.615 --> 10:58.729
And by the way, we got nothin'.

10:58.883 --> 11:00.308
Our party is a disaster.

11:00.469 --> 11:02.067
The church
is no longer available.

11:02.187 --> 11:04.339
Turns out they do Zumba Jesus
on Tuesday nights.

11:04.468 --> 11:06.390
(Pencil scratches) Grandma
and grandpa are on vacation.

11:06.521 --> 11:08.468
(Scratch) Grandpa Big
Mike was a big "no."

11:08.600 --> 11:10.052
(Scratch) I told all of their
friends to save the date,

11:10.181 --> 11:11.802
and none of them did!
(Scratch)

11:11.942 --> 11:13.512
And have you and Brick
written the skit yet?

11:13.660 --> 11:14.714
No. Of course not.

11:14.880 --> 11:15.963
So basically...

11:16.900 --> 11:20.008
we don't have <i>anything!</i>

11:20.115 --> 11:22.525
You know what?
A lot of this is <i>your</i> fault.

11:22.680 --> 11:24.049
I really could have
used Brick's help,

11:24.175 --> 11:25.704
but you broke him!

11:25.825 --> 11:28.398
Well... he took my guitar.
He brought this on himself.

11:28.513 --> 11:30.482
- He had to feel my wrath.
- Well, you know what?

11:30.641 --> 11:32.267
None of this is gonna stop me.

11:32.393 --> 11:34.837
Because Sue Heck
does not give up.

11:34.963 --> 11:37.078
Why not? If anyone
<i>should</i> give up, it's you.

11:37.202 --> 11:39.141
We are just gonna
have to scale it down!

11:39.257 --> 11:41.587
Simplify.
Work within our means.

11:41.672 --> 11:43.208
But it is still
gonna be spectacular,

11:43.328 --> 11:45.290
and it is still gonna be
super secret!

11:45.410 --> 11:47.703
So... lock it up!

11:47.814 --> 11:49.423
No mistakes!

11:49.540 --> 11:50.659
(Hisses)

12:00.959 --> 12:02.536
Hey, I was thinking maybe
we could go out to dinner

12:02.651 --> 12:04.014
tomorrow night
for our anniversary.

12:04.181 --> 12:06.415
I hear they re-did
the fountain at Fountains.

12:06.523 --> 12:08.497
- New bubbler.
- Okay, but we should eat light,

12:08.622 --> 12:10.357
'cause I know you have
a reservation for one

12:10.480 --> 12:11.987
at 1:00 in the living room.

12:12.129 --> 12:13.831
(Sighs) Look, I'm just
trying to get through this.

12:13.943 --> 12:16.258
Aw.
After 20 years of marriage,

12:16.379 --> 12:18.670
"look, I'm just trying
to get through this."

12:18.779 --> 12:20.584
Thanks so much.
That's beautiful.

12:20.697 --> 12:21.765
It's like a fairy tale.

12:21.885 --> 12:23.818
(Scoffs) You are putting
<i>way</i> too much pressure

12:23.932 --> 12:25.543
on the 20-year thing,
Frankie.

12:25.644 --> 12:27.246
Remember, we both said
it's just a number--

12:27.333 --> 12:29.824
one year after the 19th.
It's not that big a deal.

12:29.947 --> 12:31.492
Clearly.

12:32.038 --> 12:36.171
Ugh. Why do the kids always
leave their crap in here?

12:36.949 --> 12:38.332
Mike, look at this.

12:38.442 --> 12:41.050
They're throwing
a surprise party for us.

12:41.199 --> 12:42.110
(Flips page)

12:42.207 --> 12:43.135
(Gasps)

12:43.239 --> 12:46.257
It's all our friends and family
together at our church.

12:46.374 --> 12:48.038
I can't believe
they're doing this.

12:48.167 --> 12:51.897
Music and speeches and a skit.

12:51.981 --> 12:54.863
And it's all happening.
Everything's crossed off.

12:54.976 --> 12:58.060
We have the best kids.
Don't we have the best kids?

12:58.185 --> 12:59.763
Yeah. Almost makes you
want to forgive

12:59.885 --> 13:01.629
the husband
that gave 'em to ya.

13:02.244 --> 13:04.079
Here, put this back
in Sue's room.

13:04.221 --> 13:05.377
Okay.

13:16.551 --> 13:17.997
<i>The next day was</i>
<i>our anniversary,</i>

13:18.132 --> 13:19.564
<i>and I was flying high.</i>

13:19.676 --> 13:22.879
<i>- Our kids weren't quite that excited.</i>
- You guys!

13:22.992 --> 13:24.955
You're supposed to be
helping me with the party!

13:25.072 --> 13:27.319
You know what your jobs are,
so do them!

13:29.455 --> 13:31.628
Sisters, huh?
(Chuckles) She's crazy.

13:31.745 --> 13:33.628
Good thing we got each other.
Right, bro?

13:34.081 --> 13:35.163
Come on, Brick.

13:35.271 --> 13:36.812
What do you want me to say?

13:36.921 --> 13:39.502
I can't rewind time.
I can't undo what I did.

13:39.620 --> 13:40.641
I messed up. I'm sorry.

13:40.750 --> 13:42.063
Just be my brother again,
all right?

13:42.159 --> 13:44.176
I can't be alone
with these people.

13:51.071 --> 13:52.606
I don't play sports.

13:52.725 --> 13:55.100
I don't exactly have
a ton of friends.

13:55.776 --> 13:57.733
I have books.

13:58.265 --> 14:00.745
You don't read.
You don't understand.

14:00.854 --> 14:04.718
You don't know what it's like
to live in different worlds,

14:04.846 --> 14:07.702
to travel on great adventures
through the galaxy

14:07.834 --> 14:10.654
with people you know better
than you know your own family,

14:10.744 --> 14:13.629
to live and die with them.

14:13.750 --> 14:15.733
Have you ever loved anything?

14:15.854 --> 14:17.476
Do you have any idea?

14:23.213 --> 14:26.305
These are my friends, Axl--

14:26.447 --> 14:28.569
my best friends in the world.

14:28.809 --> 14:30.952
You took away something from me

14:31.124 --> 14:33.084
that I can never get back.

14:33.197 --> 14:34.674
You took it,

14:34.791 --> 14:36.881
and you wrecked it.

14:37.564 --> 14:39.758

14:47.506 --> 14:48.878

<i>had arrived,</i>

14:48.995 --> 14:51.523

Now what?

14:52.673 --> 14:54.684

I guess we wait.

we're being surprised,

17:53.100 --> 17:55.301
<i>and it was clear now</i>
<i>that nobody else was coming.</i>

17:55.416 --> 17:57.189
<i>Which is crazy,</i>
<i>'cause I saw the notebook,</i>

17:57.312 --> 17:58.591
<i>and everything was crossed off.</i>

17:58.755 --> 18:01.162
<i>Ohh.</i>

18:01.275 --> 18:02.340
A-and he said,

18:02.464 --> 18:04.571
"so you're really gonna
marry this guy?" (Sizzling)

18:04.681 --> 18:06.096
And mom said, "yes."

18:06.222 --> 18:08.774
And he said,
"well, all right."

18:08.984 --> 18:10.482
(Sizzling continues)

18:10.582 --> 18:12.670
You should really hear
grandpa Big Mike tell it.

18:12.778 --> 18:14.314
It's so romantic.

18:14.466 --> 18:15.218
(Sizzling continues)

18:15.333 --> 18:16.969
What happened here?

18:17.086 --> 18:19.320
What happened was I had to
do everything myself

18:19.430 --> 18:22.204
because <i>you</i> wouldn't
lift a finger to help me!

18:22.326 --> 18:24.257
I told you I was
working on something.

18:24.877 --> 18:25.685
(Sizzling continues)

18:25.790 --> 18:27.138
Whoa!

18:27.598 --> 18:28.765
Ugh.

18:29.330 --> 18:31.181
This is way burnt.
(Sizzling stops)

18:31.282 --> 18:33.583
All right. Who wants dark?
Who wants light?

18:33.858 --> 18:35.796
(Axl chuckles) (Voice breaks)
Axl, it is not funny!

18:35.918 --> 18:37.090
It's totally ruined,

18:37.218 --> 18:39.621
and that was my whole
spaghetti budget!

18:39.734 --> 18:42.158
This whole party is a disaster!

18:42.281 --> 18:44.067
Oh, no, Sue.
That's not true.

18:44.187 --> 18:46.583
This is really...
very nice.

18:46.707 --> 18:48.827
It is not!
I know it's not!

18:48.948 --> 18:50.852
And it's because of <i>you!</i>

18:50.971 --> 18:52.195
We had a plan!

18:52.298 --> 18:54.782
Whoa! It was never <i>our</i> plan.
It was <i>your</i> plan.

18:54.907 --> 18:57.785
It's 20 years. I wanted
to make it special!

18:57.899 --> 18:58.729
You always gotta do this!

18:58.843 --> 19:00.754
You always gotta make
a big deal out of everything!

19:00.869 --> 19:02.165
You do for family!

19:02.280 --> 19:03.532
You know what you can do
for family?

19:03.685 --> 19:04.840
Is give us all a break.

19:04.968 --> 19:06.902
God forbid I try
to do one fun thing!

19:07.014 --> 19:09.016
You always try to do one
fun thing, but it's never fun.

19:09.125 --> 19:11.308
Fine. Let's just
get through it.

19:11.421 --> 19:12.823
(Sue) - I don't want to get through it!
- Is this the skit?

19:12.939 --> 19:13.981
She's got you down.
(Axl and Sue arguing indistinctly)

19:14.100 --> 19:16.277
- He's doing you to a "T."
- Your spaghetti bowl is nothing

19:16.399 --> 19:19.726
- but a big pile of nothing! Ow!
- I don't want it to be nothing!

19:23.556 --> 19:24.753
(Gasps)

19:25.144 --> 19:27.189
(Crying) We apologize
for the inconvenience,

19:27.306 --> 19:29.860
but it appears there's going
to be an additional delay.

19:30.091 --> 19:33.563
Perhaps some cold cereal
while you wait?

19:33.677 --> 19:36.835
Aw, Sue, stop.
It's okay. Stop.

19:36.954 --> 19:40.491
It's your 20th anniversary.
I just wanted to make it great.

19:40.612 --> 19:42.424
Oh, it's just a number.

19:42.536 --> 19:44.353
And you already made it
so much better

19:44.464 --> 19:45.628
than we were going to.

19:45.742 --> 19:47.428
I mean, we didn't even
get each other anything.

19:47.528 --> 19:49.020
Speak for yourself.

19:50.092 --> 19:51.411
What's this?

19:51.532 --> 19:52.817
Open it.

19:53.346 --> 19:54.790
(Sighs)

19:56.874 --> 20:00.161
Oh, Mike! Oh, my God.

20:00.271 --> 20:01.793
Oh, dad.

20:01.908 --> 20:03.688
<i>Smooth.</i>

20:03.862 --> 20:07.244
It's so beautiful!

20:07.406 --> 20:09.578
Wait. I got you a card.

20:10.792 --> 20:11.852
Damn it.
It's here somewhere.

20:11.959 --> 20:14.374
- A-and I still might have to sign it, but...
- Frankie.

20:15.383 --> 20:16.387
(Sighs)

20:17.006 --> 20:20.420
Oh. I <i>really</i> love it.

20:21.509 --> 20:23.924
<i>So it turns out the guy</i>
<i>who didn't take my calls</i>

20:24.040 --> 20:25.675
<i>and eats steak</i>
<i>in the middle of the night</i>

20:25.790 --> 20:28.948
<i>saved up all year</i>
<i>to buy me a ring.</i>

20:29.058 --> 20:31.844
<i>Yep. Even the people</i>
<i>you know best in the world</i>

20:31.953 --> 20:33.915
<i>can still surprise you.</i>

20:35.179 --> 20:38.891
<i>Yep. Sometimes</i>
<i>they surprise you a lot.</i>

20:39.214 --> 20:40.350
Here.

20:40.489 --> 20:41.394
What's this?

20:41.514 --> 20:42.672
It's a, uh...

20:42.786 --> 20:44.213
it's a new ending
to "Planet Nowhere"

20:44.326 --> 20:46.351
that I came up with myself.
(Chuckles)

20:46.558 --> 20:49.296
So, you know,
you can have, like,

20:49.441 --> 20:53.096
the experience you
missed out on, or... something.

20:53.498 --> 20:56.078
Really?
You did this for me?

20:56.189 --> 20:57.309
Mm.

20:57.422 --> 20:59.008
Wow.

20:59.480 --> 21:00.602
This sucks.

21:00.712 --> 21:01.909
Ha.

21:02.029 --> 21:03.204
Are you sure?

21:03.307 --> 21:04.518
Maybe you just didn't get it.

21:04.624 --> 21:06.299
You see, the entire planet

21:06.400 --> 21:07.957
lives inside the stomach
of this ginormous dragon,

21:08.067 --> 21:09.329
and then when the dragon
barfs it all up,

21:09.439 --> 21:11.592
- it's just, like--
- I-I get it.

21:11.715 --> 21:14.945
Oh. (Mumbles) All right.

21:15.218 --> 21:16.772
You know, actually...

21:17.393 --> 21:20.029
there is a better way
you can make it up to me.

21:21.028 --> 21:24.624
The problem is you've never
learned to appreciate books.

21:24.734 --> 21:26.872
"Book one. Chapter one.

21:26.989 --> 21:29.468
Gallantra, The Mighty Dwarf.

21:29.660 --> 21:32.814
Beyond our galaxy,
beyond our time,

21:32.981 --> 21:35.046
beyond our collective memory,

21:35.223 --> 21:38.836
there exists a planet
of curious origin..."
