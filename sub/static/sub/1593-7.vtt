WEBVTT

00:02.795 --> 00:06.083
(loud banging)

00:08.759 --> 00:10.795
(grunting)

00:23.524 --> 00:25.185
It was--

00:25.359 --> 00:27.315
it was good
you weren't here for it.

00:28.404 --> 00:29.393
She hanging in there?

00:29.572 --> 00:31.358
( banging continues)

00:31.532 --> 00:33.272
No.

00:47.173 --> 00:49.915
( hammering )

00:50.092 --> 00:51.923
Are you gonna take
the cross, too?

00:57.308 --> 00:59.173
If we need it.

01:14.200 --> 01:18.068
He wants to go to Atlanta,
but I can't have that.

01:18.246 --> 01:21.488
Then you stay. I'll go.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.536
I owe it to Carol.

01:24.710 --> 01:27.201
We all owe Carol.

01:28.965 --> 01:30.796
I owe her more.

01:55.533 --> 01:57.319
All right.

02:06.335 --> 02:07.745
We'll be back soon.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.581
I know.

02:20.308 --> 02:22.469
(Judith crying)

02:48.627 --> 02:51.619
-( hammering echoes)
- ( crying continues)

03:27.666 --> 03:29.497
(spits)

03:34.340 --> 03:37.423
( breathing heavily )

03:37.593 --> 03:40.505
(theme music playing )

04:32.106 --> 04:33.892
Yeah?

04:35.818 --> 04:37.649
You know I've been there.

04:39.822 --> 04:41.938
I know.

04:44.910 --> 04:47.492
Bob, he would have wanted--

04:47.663 --> 04:49.403
Don't.

04:51.917 --> 04:54.579
I'm sorry.

04:54.753 --> 04:56.744
Please, don't.

05:00.843 --> 05:02.083
Okay?

05:17.276 --> 05:19.733
(monitor beeping )

05:26.911 --> 05:28.776
Excuse me.

05:29.788 --> 05:31.653
I'm just checking on her.

05:40.299 --> 05:42.631
(walkers snarling )

06:10.329 --> 06:12.320
They got no clue
we're here.

06:12.498 --> 06:14.534
That's great news
for GREATM.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.664
In less great news
for GREATM,

06:16.835 --> 06:19.326
we just scraped the bottom
of the water barrel.

06:19.505 --> 06:22.087
What is--
what's GREATM?

06:22.258 --> 06:25.000
Us. Group name.
Solidarity.

06:25.177 --> 06:26.292
Band of brothers.

06:26.470 --> 06:28.836
GREATM.

06:30.349 --> 06:32.840
Thinking about getting
a tattoo on my knuckles.

06:36.021 --> 06:38.763
Sorry, I'm just trying to think
of something else, you know?

06:38.941 --> 06:40.681
Yeah.

06:43.028 --> 06:44.484
Anything?

06:44.655 --> 06:46.361
No.

06:49.660 --> 06:51.696
Should we get him
to the church?

06:51.870 --> 06:53.781
Moving him
could make him worse.

06:53.956 --> 06:55.867
What will make him better?

06:56.041 --> 06:58.157
Waking up.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.200
If he doesn't...

07:07.303 --> 07:08.793
Come on.

07:08.971 --> 07:11.929
You haven't had anything
to drink all day.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.181
Take the bottle.

07:15.894 --> 07:18.681
Seriously, my six-year-old nephew
didn't pull this shit.

07:20.858 --> 07:23.270
( sighs )
Don't do this, Abraham.

07:25.029 --> 07:26.394
- Look at me!
- Don't.

07:26.572 --> 07:28.563
Look at me!

07:33.579 --> 07:35.240
(gun clicks)

07:39.918 --> 07:42.250
Sit down
or I'll put you down.

08:09.198 --> 08:11.359
Well, what's next
on the agenda?

08:11.533 --> 08:14.445
At sundown we fire
a shot into the air.

08:14.620 --> 08:16.451
Get two of them
out on patrol.

08:16.622 --> 08:17.657
Then once it's dark enough

08:17.831 --> 08:20.698
that the rooftop spotter
won't see us, we go.

08:20.876 --> 08:22.207
We cut the locks
on one of the stairways,

08:22.378 --> 08:23.743
take it to the fifth floor.

08:23.921 --> 08:26.628
| open the door,
Daryl takes the guard out.

08:26.799 --> 08:28.289
How?

08:28.467 --> 08:31.630
He slits his throat.

08:31.804 --> 08:33.669
This is all about
us doing this quiet,

08:33.847 --> 08:34.962
keeping the upper hand.

08:35.140 --> 08:37.222
They're not expecting us.

08:37.393 --> 08:40.476
From there, we fan out.
Knives and silenced weapons.

08:40.646 --> 08:42.978
We need to be fast.

08:43.148 --> 08:46.561
Tyreese, Sasha,
take them.

08:46.735 --> 08:50.478
Daryl, you take care
of whoever is in the kitchen.

08:50.656 --> 08:52.487
I got Dawn.

08:52.658 --> 08:55.650
If they're smart,
the rest of them will give up.

08:55.828 --> 08:57.159
Then it'll be five on three.

08:57.329 --> 08:59.490
Six on three once we get
a weapon to Beth.

08:59.665 --> 09:02.407
12 on three.
The wards will help.

09:04.920 --> 09:08.333
That's best case.
What's worst case?

09:10.801 --> 09:12.632
All it takes
is one of those cops

09:12.803 --> 09:14.634
going down the hall
at the wrong time.

09:14.805 --> 09:18.263
Then it's not quiet.
All hands on deck.

09:18.434 --> 09:20.516
We're talking about
a lot of bullets flying around.

09:20.686 --> 09:23.519
- If that's what it takes.
- It's not.

09:23.689 --> 09:26.351
If we get a couple
of her cops alive,

09:26.525 --> 09:29.187
out here,
we do an even trade.

09:29.361 --> 09:33.604
Theirs for ours.
Everybody goes home.

09:33.782 --> 09:35.443
Yeah, I get it.

09:35.617 --> 09:37.608
And it might work.

09:37.786 --> 09:40.869
This will work.

09:44.168 --> 09:46.159
Nah, that'll work, too.

09:47.629 --> 09:48.618
You say this Dawn,

09:48.797 --> 09:50.662
she's just trying to
keep it together, right?

09:50.841 --> 09:53.332
Trying and doing
are two different things.

09:53.510 --> 09:56.377
You take two of her cops away,

09:56.555 --> 09:59.217
what choices does she have?

09:59.391 --> 10:01.382
Everybody goes home.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.551
Like he says.

10:21.705 --> 10:23.241
Pick one.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.456
You need to learn
how to defend yourself.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.917
We can teach you.

10:34.426 --> 10:37.338
Defend myself?

10:37.513 --> 10:39.504
They said they'd go.

10:39.681 --> 10:42.218
Carl: They were liars
and murderers.

10:42.392 --> 10:45.054
- Gabriel: Just like us.
- We protected ourselves.

10:45.229 --> 10:47.436
They wanted us dead.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.857
You're lucky your church
has lasted this long.

10:55.531 --> 10:58.273
You can't stay
in one place anymore.

10:58.450 --> 11:01.112
Not for too long.

11:01.286 --> 11:03.777
And once you're out there,

11:03.956 --> 11:06.868
you're gonna find trouble
you can't hide from.

11:07.042 --> 11:09.909
You need to know
how to fight.

11:20.973 --> 11:22.634
Good choice.

11:22.808 --> 11:24.719
But you're not
holding it right.

11:24.893 --> 11:27.009
You've got to be able
to drive it down

11:27.187 --> 11:29.473
'cause sometimes
their skulls aren't as soft

11:29.648 --> 11:32.185
- and you need to be able--
- I'm sorry.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.350
( swallows )

11:36.071 --> 11:37.982
No.

11:39.741 --> 11:41.697
I need to lie down.

11:49.334 --> 11:50.585
Dawn:
That's your plan, huh?

11:50.752 --> 11:52.743
O'Donnell: Look, we are doing
everything we can.

11:52.921 --> 11:54.627
Licari is out
in the sedan right now.

11:54.798 --> 11:56.834
If there is a sign of Noah,
we are going to find him.

11:57.009 --> 11:58.715
You just told me that your plan

11:58.886 --> 12:01.047
was counting on him
screwing up.

12:01.221 --> 12:05.180
That's some active
police work right there.

12:08.645 --> 12:10.636
Was there anything else?

12:11.899 --> 12:14.185
Yes, actually, there was.

12:14.359 --> 12:17.396
The patient in exam room two,

12:17.571 --> 12:19.436
she was half dead
when I brought her in.

12:19.615 --> 12:22.652
She's not looking so good.

12:22.826 --> 12:24.782
This ain't Pin the Tail
On the Donkey.

12:24.953 --> 12:26.238
Are we really gonna
keep wasting

12:26.413 --> 12:28.028
valuable resources on this lady?

12:28.206 --> 12:30.697
How much electricity
does your DVD take?

12:30.876 --> 12:31.865
Excuse me?

12:32.044 --> 12:34.786
We have very limited
resources here.

12:34.963 --> 12:36.464
You charge it every day.

12:36.632 --> 12:39.248
- Are you kidding me?
- Beth.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.758
That woman has been
here one day.

12:42.763 --> 12:44.128
- Beth.
- What good is this place

12:44.306 --> 12:45.762
if it doesn't try to save people?

12:45.933 --> 12:47.594
Turn off the machines.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.476
Tell Edwards to take the patient
off of his rounds.

12:51.647 --> 12:53.183
If she pulls through
on her own, then fine.

12:53.357 --> 12:55.689
But you're right.
She's not worth the effort.

13:02.157 --> 13:03.658
( door closes)

13:05.410 --> 13:07.116
(sighs)

13:07.287 --> 13:09.619
You just killed that woman.

13:11.625 --> 13:13.206
Who do you think
l have to side with?

13:13.377 --> 13:16.119
Tell him. Tell him you
changed your mind.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.252
You don't know how fragile
this thing is.

13:19.841 --> 13:21.752
There's nothing I can do.

13:24.888 --> 13:27.425
So you'll just have to do it.

13:29.351 --> 13:31.307
You're gonna save
that woman's life.

13:34.439 --> 13:36.725
This is to the drug locker.

13:36.900 --> 13:38.606
I don't even trust
Edwards with this.

13:38.777 --> 13:40.358
So take it.

13:40.529 --> 13:42.315
Shepherd on radio:
lt's Shepherd. I'm on roof detail.

13:42.489 --> 13:45.697
Just heard a gunshot
maybe a mile north-northeast.

13:45.867 --> 13:48.950
Grab Lamson, take a car
and track it down.

13:49.121 --> 13:50.702
Yes, ma'am.

13:52.124 --> 13:54.365
Why are you doing this?

13:54.543 --> 13:56.875
I thought you were weak.

13:59.506 --> 14:00.962
You've proved me wrong.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.675
Glenn:
We need more water.

14:05.846 --> 14:07.336
There's a creek up the road

14:07.514 --> 14:09.425
a few miles southwest of here.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.808
Y'all go.
I'll stay here.

14:13.979 --> 14:16.470
- You sure?
- I am.

14:21.028 --> 14:23.019
Okay.

14:36.877 --> 14:39.869
(walkers snarling )

14:50.474 --> 14:52.590
Just stay here, guys.
Don't get up.

14:52.768 --> 14:55.851
There is nothing
for you in Washington.

14:56.021 --> 14:58.012
That's not funny.

14:58.190 --> 15:00.681
It's not not
not not funny.

15:00.859 --> 15:03.191
Hey, I get that we're all dealing
with things in different ways--

15:03.361 --> 15:07.320
Listen, I don't know what to do
without DC anymore,

15:07.491 --> 15:09.527
but I'm not dealing with it.
I'm over it.

15:09.701 --> 15:11.566
ljust want him to be okay.

15:11.745 --> 15:15.203
Eugene wasn't strong.
He isn't fast.

15:15.373 --> 15:17.034
He doesn't know
how to use a weapon.

15:17.209 --> 15:19.416
The truth hurts,
but he's useless.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.702
He had one skill
that kept him living.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.962
Are we supposed to be mad
at him 'cause he used it?

15:27.052 --> 15:28.713
Damn right.

16:53.597 --> 16:55.588
Get over yourself.

16:57.267 --> 16:59.804
You're not the only one
who lost something today.

17:02.439 --> 17:04.930
It's never gonna get
any better than this.

17:23.668 --> 17:25.704
Beth.

17:25.879 --> 17:27.790
Can I?

17:29.257 --> 17:31.122
Yeah, sure.

17:39.434 --> 17:40.799
The woman
in exam room two,

17:40.977 --> 17:43.013
what medicine
would you give her?

17:43.188 --> 17:44.553
Dawn called it.

17:44.731 --> 17:47.564
I know, but if you could,
what would you give her?

17:47.734 --> 17:51.192
She was in a car accident.
She suffered internal injuries.

17:51.363 --> 17:54.196
- It's just a guessing game.
- So guess.

17:55.659 --> 17:58.401
You have the key.

17:58.578 --> 18:01.661
Did you take it
or did she give it to you?

18:01.831 --> 18:03.696
Because if she gave it to you,
she did not do it

18:03.875 --> 18:04.990
out of the kindness
of her heart.

18:05.168 --> 18:07.955
Don't. Just tell me
what medicine.

18:08.129 --> 18:10.711
l was trying to save my life.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.711
I'm still wondering if I did.

18:18.473 --> 18:20.555
Epinephrine drip,
five milligrams.

18:22.894 --> 18:24.475
She won't wake up
right away,

18:24.646 --> 18:27.388
but it'll ease her blood pressure
so she'll have a shot.

18:32.404 --> 18:34.190
Hey.

18:35.573 --> 18:37.700
Good luck.

18:46.918 --> 18:48.783
(sighs)

18:48.962 --> 18:51.294
Perfect.

18:51.464 --> 18:54.422
You think it's any
clearer upstream?

18:54.592 --> 18:56.548
(fabric ripping )

18:57.804 --> 19:00.511
Probably not.

19:00.682 --> 19:02.968
Doesn't matter.

19:03.143 --> 19:04.804
Let me see.

19:08.940 --> 19:12.273
Tara: So, you just built a water filter
in about two minutes, huh?

19:12.444 --> 19:14.526
Eugene taught me.

19:14.696 --> 19:17.984
Takes a while, but it'll be clear.
Then we can boil it.

19:19.784 --> 19:22.400
Were you with Abraham
before it all happened?

19:22.579 --> 19:24.410
No.

19:24.581 --> 19:27.118
No, l was with other people
just trying to make it.

19:31.046 --> 19:32.877
How'd you wind up together?

19:35.050 --> 19:37.883
We crossed paths in Dallas.

19:38.053 --> 19:40.760
Me and my group, we were
fighting off some dead ones

19:40.930 --> 19:42.636
and hejumped in
from out of nowhere

19:42.807 --> 19:44.763
with that big truck.

19:44.934 --> 19:46.799
Rest in peace.

19:46.978 --> 19:48.718
He had Eugene in the cab.

19:48.897 --> 19:49.932
And afterwards,
he told me

19:50.106 --> 19:51.812
that he was trying
to save the world.

19:53.735 --> 19:56.067
And that he saw
what I could do.

19:56.237 --> 19:58.398
And he wanted my help.

20:01.493 --> 20:03.449
He was the first person
to ask me for that

20:03.620 --> 20:05.611
since this all started.

20:10.502 --> 20:12.709
Maybe he was lying, too.

20:20.220 --> 20:22.757
( splashes )

20:22.931 --> 20:25.013
You see that?

20:26.518 --> 20:28.804
Those ripples.

20:28.978 --> 20:30.809
Those are fish.

20:32.607 --> 20:34.108
Okay, how?

20:34.275 --> 20:36.140
Come on.

20:37.695 --> 20:39.481
Lamson:
Shots were from over there.

20:39.656 --> 20:41.362
I swear to God I heard it.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.992
- ( gunshots )
- There. There!

20:53.002 --> 20:55.379
- Put it down, Noah.
- Put the gun down.

20:57.549 --> 21:00.040
( car door closes )

21:00.218 --> 21:03.130
Hands up.
Turn around.

21:11.438 --> 21:13.144
You let me know
if it's too tight, okay?

21:13.314 --> 21:14.303
I thought you were smart, Noah.

21:14.482 --> 21:16.347
You think we wouldn't hear you?

21:20.405 --> 21:22.020
Where are those rotters
you were shooting at?

21:22.198 --> 21:24.610
( whistles )
Hands.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.069
What do you want?

21:26.244 --> 21:29.736
Whatever this is,
we can help.

21:29.914 --> 21:33.827
You do what we say,
we don't hurt you.

21:37.255 --> 21:39.246
Okay.

21:41.634 --> 21:44.467
Good.
Now turn around.

21:44.637 --> 21:47.219
Put your guns on
the floor and kneel.

21:59.360 --> 22:01.442
We need to talk.

22:03.364 --> 22:05.616
There's water if you
need some and food.

22:09.204 --> 22:11.570
Mind if I ask you something?

22:15.710 --> 22:18.042
The way you talk...

22:19.506 --> 22:21.918
the way you carry yourself...

22:23.801 --> 22:25.302
were you a cop?

22:28.932 --> 22:31.139
Believe it or not,
I was, too.

22:32.143 --> 22:34.099
That's Lamson.

22:34.270 --> 22:35.931
He'll be down for this.

22:36.105 --> 22:37.936
He's one of the good ones.

22:38.107 --> 22:39.643
(tires squealing )

22:39.817 --> 22:42.399
(gunfire)

23:12.058 --> 23:14.174
(snarling )

23:20.483 --> 23:22.348
(flies buzzing )

23:33.580 --> 23:35.161
(car door opens)

23:38.001 --> 23:39.707
Two, on me.

24:18.291 --> 24:19.997
(grunts)

24:27.342 --> 24:28.923
(snarling )

24:57.955 --> 24:59.035
(grunts)

25:01.709 --> 25:03.324
(silenced gunshot)

25:08.800 --> 25:10.290
Okay.

25:11.469 --> 25:13.630
You win, asshole.

25:27.235 --> 25:30.602
Rick. Rick!

25:36.411 --> 25:38.618
Rick...

25:38.788 --> 25:40.153
three is better than two.

26:03.896 --> 26:06.103
Your friend,
what's his name?

26:06.274 --> 26:07.389
I need to talk to him.

26:07.567 --> 26:09.228
Your plan is going to get
me and my friends killed.

26:09.402 --> 26:10.812
We're gonna make it work.

26:10.987 --> 26:13.524
It would work if you had
different cops to trade.

26:15.116 --> 26:17.107
Dawn's running Grady
into the ground.

26:17.285 --> 26:19.025
A bunch of us want her out
and she knows it.

26:19.203 --> 26:21.694
Pretty sure she knows we want
Lamson to replace her, too.

26:21.873 --> 26:23.329
Dawn doesn't know that.

26:23.499 --> 26:25.035
She might.

26:25.209 --> 26:27.541
And she's smart.

26:27.712 --> 26:30.044
So there's a good chance
you can't make this deal work

26:30.214 --> 26:31.670
and that'll leave us all dead.

26:32.717 --> 26:34.833
But if you let us go,

26:35.011 --> 26:37.127
we'll take care
of Dawn ourselves

26:37.305 --> 26:40.047
and then we'll let your friends go
and this is over.

26:41.225 --> 26:43.477
No, we're not gonna do that.

26:45.563 --> 26:48.646
- Shepherd: Do you want to die?
- No.

26:48.816 --> 26:50.898
ljust need you
to shut up right now.

26:57.283 --> 26:59.114
You can make this work.

27:00.620 --> 27:01.985
But you've got to be able
to talk to her.

27:02.163 --> 27:04.245
Noah told us all about her.

27:04.415 --> 27:06.406
I've known her
for eight years, ma'am.

27:07.460 --> 27:09.200
I know this woman.

27:10.338 --> 27:14.081
And my only interest
is peaceful resolution,

27:14.258 --> 27:18.297
not dying, and sleeping
in my bed tonight.

27:19.680 --> 27:23.764
So, please, let me help you.

27:25.645 --> 27:27.226
Please.

27:31.025 --> 27:32.811
Hey, Rick.

27:32.985 --> 27:34.941
You're gonna want to hear this.

27:37.615 --> 27:39.230
- ( snarling)
- ( grunts)

28:03.933 --> 28:05.423
Rosita.

28:07.228 --> 28:09.093
( chuckles )

28:11.732 --> 28:13.984
Hey, how are we doing
over there, Tara?

28:14.151 --> 28:16.893
(gasping )

28:18.656 --> 28:21.398
Pretty damn good.
How about you?

28:24.537 --> 28:27.370
A screwdriver.
Phillips head.

28:27.540 --> 28:29.326
Almost.

28:30.543 --> 28:32.408
Almost.

28:33.421 --> 28:35.036
- Now!
-( laughs)

28:35.214 --> 28:37.671
- Hell, yes.
- It worked.

28:37.842 --> 28:39.503
Nice.

28:39.677 --> 28:40.917
You know how to clean
these things?

28:41.095 --> 28:42.676
I know how to clean
these things.

28:42.847 --> 28:44.803
Good, we're gonna need that.

28:47.852 --> 28:51.185
Wherever we all wind up.
You in?

28:53.107 --> 28:55.849
( chuckles )

28:56.027 --> 28:57.813
I'm in.

28:59.780 --> 29:01.862
- Good.
- Guys.

29:02.033 --> 29:04.649
You will never believe
what's in this bag.

29:07.204 --> 29:08.705
Yes?

29:09.707 --> 29:11.789
You, uh...

29:11.959 --> 29:14.575
you said you weren't
feeling good.

29:14.754 --> 29:16.619
You doing okay?

29:16.797 --> 29:20.164
- Yeah, I was just resting.
- ( Judith crying)

29:24.096 --> 29:26.212
I know all this is new to you.

29:28.559 --> 29:30.390
All of it.

29:33.314 --> 29:36.351
ljust wanted to tell you,

29:36.525 --> 29:38.061
for you to know...

29:40.363 --> 29:42.228
the things that we do...

29:44.867 --> 29:46.073
they're worth it.

29:46.243 --> 29:48.234
I already took the machete.
What more do you want from me?

29:48.412 --> 29:50.664
I don't want anything from you.

29:52.124 --> 29:54.080
I'm just trying to help.

29:58.339 --> 30:00.125
Thank you.

30:49.807 --> 30:52.264
(coughing)

30:56.480 --> 30:58.141
Here you go.
Come on.

30:58.315 --> 30:59.691
- I can't-- I can't--
- You all right?

30:59.859 --> 31:01.474
- I can't breathe.
- Get Edwards now.

31:01.652 --> 31:03.643
- You, get a gurney.
- I got it.

31:03.821 --> 31:06.028
- O'Donnell: It's okay. Look at me.
- Alvarado: Take it easy.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.859
O'Donnell:
Breathe. Breathe.

31:08.034 --> 31:09.990
(coughing continues)

31:12.204 --> 31:14.820
Alvarado:
All right. Easy, easy.

31:14.999 --> 31:16.614
O'Donnell:
Stay with me.

31:20.004 --> 31:22.495
Breathe.

31:22.673 --> 31:24.755
- Breathe.
- ( coughing stops)

31:26.719 --> 31:28.505
|-- I'm okay.

31:29.513 --> 31:32.095
I don't know what that was.
Thank you.

32:02.755 --> 32:04.620
( distant door closes )

32:14.725 --> 32:16.716
Carol.

32:20.022 --> 32:21.603
lt's Beth.

32:27.321 --> 32:30.313
ljust wanted you to know
that l was here.

32:38.582 --> 32:40.573
(snarling )

32:51.512 --> 32:53.127
(rips)

32:55.099 --> 32:56.589
(rips)

33:06.068 --> 33:07.899
( clangs )

33:10.281 --> 33:13.114
I'm gonna say it
and you're gonna listen.

33:13.284 --> 33:16.617
And then, when you're ready,
you let me help you.

33:18.247 --> 33:20.329
You got to say good-bye.

33:22.084 --> 33:25.121
He saw it.
He felt it.

33:25.296 --> 33:27.503
And you hold onto
whatever you want to,

33:27.673 --> 33:29.959
but I think you should
hold onto that.

33:35.472 --> 33:37.884
I should have been able
to do it myself.

33:39.226 --> 33:41.137
You could've.

33:41.312 --> 33:43.769
But you let yourself feel it.

33:43.939 --> 33:46.555
Kept your eyes open.

33:46.734 --> 33:49.146
You let me help you.

34:18.015 --> 34:21.007
( breathing heavily )

34:46.085 --> 34:48.076
( groans )

35:15.072 --> 35:17.108
She'll tell you
she won't make a deal.

35:18.409 --> 35:21.151
She'll tell you
she won't compromise.

35:21.328 --> 35:23.114
But she will.

35:23.289 --> 35:25.280
She always does.

35:26.875 --> 35:30.242
Just-- just know
who you're talking to.

35:33.090 --> 35:35.627
Probably heading out
in the next 10 minutes or so.

35:35.801 --> 35:37.917
Anything you need
before we leave?

35:39.305 --> 35:41.421
Actually, water would be great.

35:43.559 --> 35:45.550
Will do.

35:45.728 --> 35:47.719
Thanks, Sergeant Lamson.

35:47.896 --> 35:49.352
My name's Bob.

35:52.609 --> 35:54.440
You're still a cop.

35:55.612 --> 35:57.864
No.

35:58.032 --> 36:00.273
No, the real ones are all gone.

36:11.086 --> 36:14.374
( rustling )

36:23.599 --> 36:25.464
(snarling )

37:02.262 --> 37:03.672
Damn it.

37:14.858 --> 37:17.315
(sighs)

37:17.486 --> 37:19.192
l'm-- I'm okay.

37:19.363 --> 37:21.695
I'll be okay.

37:22.991 --> 37:24.697
Me, too.

37:24.868 --> 37:26.859
The parking lot,

37:27.037 --> 37:30.529
when you were bringing us
back up here |-- I saw a rotter.

37:32.126 --> 37:34.538
I saw one of the rotters
and I knew him.

37:47.933 --> 37:50.174
His name was Tyler.

37:50.352 --> 37:53.059
I met him at Grady.

37:53.230 --> 37:55.892
We were both sent there
when shit started going down.

37:57.860 --> 37:59.976
It took two whole days
to evacuate everyone.

38:00.154 --> 38:02.236
Didn't sleep.
We didn't eat.

38:03.449 --> 38:07.112
But still, it was
the two best days of my life.

38:10.330 --> 38:14.744
l was supposed to drive
the last van of survivors to the zone

38:14.918 --> 38:16.874
and Dawn pulled me off.

38:18.172 --> 38:19.753
She wanted someone
she could really trust

38:19.923 --> 38:21.788
and she put Tyler on it instead.

38:23.427 --> 38:26.419
These-- these people
were gonna all be evacuated.

38:26.597 --> 38:28.428
l was really pissed.

38:29.433 --> 38:31.139
I saw him out there.

38:33.187 --> 38:35.849
Stuck out there,
melted to the asphalt.

38:38.066 --> 38:40.443
And all I could think was,

38:40.611 --> 38:42.567
"That would have been me.

38:44.239 --> 38:46.525
It would have been me.
He saved my life."

38:46.700 --> 38:48.691
He's been out there
the whole time.

38:48.869 --> 38:50.450
Like he's a part of the street.

38:50.621 --> 38:53.328
Some screwed up,
endless joke.

38:56.793 --> 38:58.954
And there's nothing
I can do about it.

39:00.464 --> 39:02.750
So let me help you.

39:06.178 --> 39:07.714
Do you remember
where he was?

39:09.348 --> 39:13.057
Yeah, |-- I can take you
right to him.

39:13.227 --> 39:15.593
We're not going out there,
but I'm a good shot.

39:17.022 --> 39:18.262
Show me.

39:21.777 --> 39:23.642
Okay.

39:26.156 --> 39:28.067
South side of the building.

39:28.242 --> 39:30.779
You can see him from in there.

39:53.183 --> 39:55.265
You're thirsty.

39:55.435 --> 39:57.096
Don't say you're not.

40:07.656 --> 40:10.113
Did you want me to shoot you?

40:12.536 --> 40:14.527
I thought I did.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.116
But I didn't.

40:27.009 --> 40:29.295
(groaning)

40:30.721 --> 40:33.053
Eugene:
He||-- hello?

40:34.725 --> 40:36.215
I'm coming.

40:40.897 --> 40:42.637
Stay right there.
Don't try to move.

40:44.067 --> 40:45.807
You're gonna be okay.

40:53.619 --> 40:55.735
You know, the more
I think about it,

40:55.912 --> 41:01.327
maybe it wasn't completely
not not not funny.

41:02.628 --> 41:05.415
(walker snarling )

41:06.465 --> 41:07.955
Hey.

41:09.468 --> 41:11.424
Don't even look at it.

41:38.955 --> 41:40.115
You see him?

41:43.877 --> 41:46.414
About 20 yards
right of the sedan.

41:49.633 --> 41:51.373
There's a half wall.

41:54.262 --> 41:56.093
He's leaning against it.

42:01.561 --> 42:03.176
lsee him.

42:05.357 --> 42:06.972
Are you sure that's him?

42:18.954 --> 42:21.240
(theme music playing )
