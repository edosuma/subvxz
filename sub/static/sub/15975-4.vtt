You know what this week's
Internet-poll question is?

01:05:06.671 --> 01:05:08.332
"Who's cooler --
Dan or Casey?"

01:05:08.406 --> 01:05:09.202
That's right.

01:05:09.274 --> 01:05:10.332

-- You know how many people have voted?
-- <i>Nope.</i>

-- <i>Really?</i>
-- <i>Yes.</i>

You know who's winning?

01:05:19.317 --> 01:05:20.842
Well, I'm assuming you are.

No.

01:05:24.389 --> 01:05:25.322
I am?

Yes.

How 'bout that?

01:05:27.759 --> 01:05:28.692
Yeah.

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:30.250
Hey, let's talk about
Notre Dame.

01:05:40.505 --> 01:05:41.973
Yeah.

01:05:43.341 --> 01:05:45.366
That's quite
a landslide so far.

-- <i>Yeah.</i>
-- <i>You wouldn't think</i>

01:05:47.712 --> 01:05:49.908
there'd be this kind of
grass-roots groundswell

01:05:49.981 --> 01:05:51.278
so early on,

01:05:51.349 --> 01:05:52.612
but I've always
been able to count on

<i>Here's the thing
about you</i> --

01:06:04.429 --> 01:06:06.363
it's not that you want
to win so bad.

01:06:06.431 --> 01:06:08.559
It's that you won't admit
you want to win.

01:06:08.633 --> 01:06:10.795
Danny...

01:06:10.869 --> 01:06:14.169

my name from the competition.

-- No, no, no.
-- You sure?

01:06:15.874 --> 01:06:18.241
I have plenty of fans.

01:06:18.310 --> 01:06:20.404
-- At least half a dozen.
-- [Laughs]

-- Walk with me.
-- Okay.

So it doesn't look like
we're up to something.

-- What are we up to?
-- Nothing.

01:06:34.726 --> 01:06:36.751

a compromising situation

-- are you about to ask me?
-- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

Can you rig my computer

-- On the Internet?
-- I was up all night voting.

01:06:50.108 --> 01:06:52.873
At first I kept returning to
the home page and going back.

01:06:52.944 --> 01:06:55.436
Then I figured out I could
hold down the return key

01:06:55.513 --> 01:06:58.346
and hit F12 for refresh, but
even that was taking too long.

01:06:58.416 --> 01:07:00.350

-- No.

-- Why did you yell?
-- I meant to say "Hi."

-- I misspoke.

A little bit, but I've
been through worse.

It's interesting you can
make that determination,

seeing as how you've been
paying no attention whatsoever.

01:09:58.663 --> 01:09:59.858
How is it you can do that?

01:09:59.931 --> 01:10:02.366

-- Oh, what's his name?
-- You're not gonna believe it.

-- No.

-- Yes.

of a time finding him a Spanish name.

01:11:18.610 --> 01:11:19.634

was six months.

It's been two weeks, and you still
haven't gone out on a single date.

01:11:32.924 --> 01:11:34.517

[Chuckles]
For instance,

01:12:23.942 --> 01:12:26.377
I could say something funny
and make you laugh.

01:12:26.444 --> 01:12:29.209
-- Yes? -- Or it wouldn't
even have to be funny.

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:32.045
It could be serious
or personal.

<i>See what I'm saying?</i>

01:12:33.318 --> 01:12:34.945

to chatter at someone
with energy and enthusiasm,

01:12:37.555 --> 01:12:40.115
regardless of whether they
appear interested or not.

01:12:40.191 --> 01:12:42.455
And that's not
just on camera.

01:12:45.797 --> 01:12:48.095
Dan, I've done quite
a number of these jobs.

01:12:49.901 --> 01:12:51.699
And there's a preconception
when I show up

01:12:51.769 --> 01:12:54.704
that I'm going to be an
obnoxious, sniveling Philistine

01:12:54.772 --> 01:12:56.399
or a suit
or someone's cousin.

01:12:56.474 --> 01:12:59.569
That's what you thought when
you heard I was coming, right?

01:12:59.644 --> 01:13:00.736
Yes. But I --

<i>But this isn't TV camp.</i>

01:13:03.314 --> 01:13:04.873
I come in, I do my job.

01:13:04.949 --> 01:13:07.008
I do it better than
anybody else, and I get out.

01:13:07.085 --> 01:13:09.486

have prejudged you,

and I hear that,

01:13:16.594 --> 01:13:18.585

I turned around, man.

01:13:22.467 --> 01:13:25.767

Who knows?

-- He was good.

-- Can I talk to you a second?
-- Sure.

01:14:27.899 --> 01:14:30.891
Something interesting
happened at dinner tonight.

01:14:30.968 --> 01:14:31.867
What?

01:14:31.936 --> 01:14:34.598
I took off my panties.

01:14:34.672 --> 01:14:36.834
-- Really?
-- <i>Yes.</i>

01:14:36.908 --> 01:14:39.172

-- <i>At the</i> table?
-- <i>Under the table.</i>

01:14:41.279 --> 01:14:43.646
-- Could people see you? -- Not
unless they were under the table.

01:14:43.715 --> 01:14:45.080
Okay.

01:14:45.149 --> 01:14:47.208
-- No, those were all good questions.
-- Here's another one.

01:14:47.285 --> 01:14:49.117
Why did I take
my underwear off?

01:14:49.187 --> 01:14:50.586
Yes.

01:14:50.655 --> 01:14:52.384
-- Perfectly fair.
-- Yes.

01:14:52.457 --> 01:14:54.482
-- VVas your underwear making
you uncomfortable? -- No.

01:14:54.559 --> 01:14:56.220
Sometimes when I wear
cotton briefs --

01:14:56.294 --> 01:14:57.887
No, these were silk.
They were fine.

<i>I think it had something
to do with Sam Donovan</i>

01:15:05.536 --> 01:15:07.868
and not having the kind of control
over the show I'm used to.

01:15:07.939 --> 01:15:09.737
I think it had something
to do with Cab Calloway

01:15:09.807 --> 01:15:11.502
being a staggeringly
boring dinner companion.

01:15:11.576 --> 01:15:12.737
But mostly...

01:15:14.412 --> 01:15:16.346
I'd heard about
other people doing it.

01:15:16.414 --> 01:15:19.281
-- What other people? -- Other
people -- <i>fn</i> magazines.

01:15:19.350 --> 01:15:21.876
-- What magazines? -- Good
magazines, and at the movies.

01:15:21.953 --> 01:15:22.977
What movies?

01:15:23.054 --> 01:15:24.215

at restaurants,
in limousines.

-- <i>VVhich restaurants?</i> -- <i>Don't ask
what restaurants and limousines.</i>

01:15:30.228 --> 01:15:31.559

with you?

from his demeanor.

-- It's just an expression.

back from dinner without her panties.

without her panties,

let roll right over me.

01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:59.094
Then why are you talking
like Theodoric of York?

01:18:59.170 --> 01:19:00.660
That's a perfectly
fair question.

01:19:00.738 --> 01:19:01.830
-- Jeremy...
-- Yes?

01:19:01.906 --> 01:19:03.396
-- Move.
-- What?

01:19:03.474 --> 01:19:05.135
Move. I need to talk
to Natalie.

01:19:05.209 --> 01:19:07.610
-- Why can't you talk to Natalie --
-- <i>I need to</i> talk <i>to</i> her privately.

01:19:07.678 --> 01:19:09.840
Ah. No problem.

01:19:09.914 --> 01:19:11.814
I'll just stand over there
for 5 minutes and 40 seconds

01:19:11.882 --> 01:19:14.010
and think about what my life was
like before I met any of you.

01:19:14.085 --> 01:19:15.553
-- Okay.
-- Thanks, honey.

01:19:15.619 --> 01:19:17.053
Does Casey know?

01:19:17.121 --> 01:19:18.054
No.

01:19:18.122 --> 01:19:19.180
-- You sure?
-- Yes.

01:19:19.256 --> 01:19:20.655
He's been acting
strange during the show.

01:19:20.725 --> 01:19:22.591
-- He doesn't know. -- He's
been acting like he knows.

01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:23.821
He doesn't.

01:19:23.894 --> 01:19:24.861
Okay.

01:19:24.929 --> 01:19:26.090
-- Dana?
-- Yeah?

01:19:26.163 --> 01:19:29.428
-- Casey knows. I accidentally told him.
-- Oh, Natalie...

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:32.128
Don't tell me you
weren't doing something.

01:19:32.203 --> 01:19:34.535
[Laughs]
2.5 million people voted.

01:19:34.605 --> 01:19:37.404
That's more than in most
statewide elections.

01:19:37.475 --> 01:19:39.170
2.5 million people.

01:19:39.243 --> 01:19:41.439
You know how many people
voted for me, huh?

01:19:41.512 --> 01:19:43.241
<i>232.</i>

01:19:43.314 --> 01:19:44.748
So don't think I'm paranoid

01:19:44.815 --> 01:19:46.840
for thinking something
fishy might be up.

01:19:46.917 --> 01:19:48.681
I have to go ask her.

01:19:48.753 --> 01:19:50.585
Tell me for real.

01:19:50.654 --> 01:19:53.021
Is this 'cause I Krazy-glued
Jeremy's stuff to his desk?

01:19:53.090 --> 01:19:57.027
-- [ Sighs] I'm gonna go in and ask her.
Dave: <i>3</i> 1/2 minutes <i>back.</i>

01:19:57.094 --> 01:19:58.493
-- Dana?
Dana: <i>Yes?</i>

01:19:58.562 --> 01:20:00.963
You and I are about to have
an abrupt conversation.

01:20:01.032 --> 01:20:02.329
-- <i>Dave?</i>
-- <i>3 1/2 minutes.</i>

01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:05.165
We can't have an abrupt
conversation right now, Casey,

01:20:05.236 --> 01:20:07.034
'cause we're back
in 31/2 minutes.

01:20:07.104 --> 01:20:08.333
Well, I'm not back
in 31/2 minutes

01:20:08.406 --> 01:20:09.840
unless I get some
answers, so let's go.

01:20:12.209 --> 01:20:15.076
Natalie, remind me to give you
a beating in the morning.

01:20:15.146 --> 01:20:17.046
I'll do it.

01:20:17.114 --> 01:20:19.173
[Telephones ringing]

01:20:19.250 --> 01:20:20.718
It's easy to explain.

01:20:20.785 --> 01:20:22.116
-- Really? -- Actually,
it's hard to explain.

01:20:22.186 --> 01:20:24.154
-- You think? -- So maybe when I
have more than 3 1/2 minutes --

01:20:24.221 --> 01:20:25.985
I have all the time
in the world.

01:20:26.057 --> 01:20:27.491
-- Casey...
-- I mean it, Dana.

01:20:28.893 --> 01:20:31.123
Okay.

01:20:31.195 --> 01:20:33.687
All right, I'll try
and do this as best

01:20:33.764 --> 01:20:35.755
-- and as fast as I can.
-- I'm listening.

01:20:35.833 --> 01:20:37.562
Dinner was incredibly boring.

01:20:37.635 --> 01:20:39.831
I shifted in my seat.
My panties moved.

01:20:39.904 --> 01:20:40.996
I was amused by that.

01:20:41.072 --> 01:20:43.166
I tried shifting
the other side, it worked.

01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:46.938
And then it became a thing, like can I make
it home without hitting any red lights,

01:20:47.011 --> 01:20:48.945
or can I say all the state capitals
before the plane takes off?

01:20:49.013 --> 01:20:50.481
And then... [Snaps
fingers] there they were.

01:20:50.548 --> 01:20:51.674
-- Your panties?
-- Yes.

01:20:51.749 --> 01:20:53.114
Why didn't you
put them back on?

01:20:53.184 --> 01:20:54.583
-- At the restaurant?
-- Yeah.

01:20:54.652 --> 01:20:56.848
I snuck them back in my purse, and
that's when I got to thinking.

01:20:56.921 --> 01:20:58.252
What?

01:20:58.322 --> 01:21:00.381
This is the part you're
not gonna understand.

01:21:00.458 --> 01:21:02.017
This is the part I'm
not gonna understand?

01:21:02.093 --> 01:21:04.027
I've always taken
people's word for it

01:21:04.095 --> 01:21:07.929
that certain things
were...dirty

01:21:07.998 --> 01:21:09.159
and certain things weren't.

01:21:09.233 --> 01:21:11.099
I have always taken
people's word for it.

01:21:11.168 --> 01:21:13.034
And I'm a grown woman,
and at some point,

01:21:13.104 --> 01:21:14.367
you want to decide
for yourself,

01:21:14.438 --> 01:21:16.372
is the world gonna fall down
if I do this?

01:21:16.440 --> 01:21:18.568
Or if maybe everyone should
mind their own business.

01:21:18.642 --> 01:21:21.111
Let me tell you something, Casey.
The world didn't fall down.

01:21:21.178 --> 01:21:23.112
In fact, truth be told,
I liked it.

01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:24.944
-- Dana... -- And that's all
I'm gonna say about it.

01:21:25.015 --> 01:21:27.382
-- Dana... -- So think what you will,
but that's all I'm gonna say about it.

01:21:27.451 --> 01:21:28.543
-- Stop talking.
-- Okay.

01:21:28.619 --> 01:21:29.780
Do you think I think

01:21:29.854 --> 01:21:32.323
you taking your panties
off is a bad idea?

01:21:32.389 --> 01:21:34.357
-- Yeah, but --
-- I support the idea.

01:21:34.425 --> 01:21:36.120
I'm in favor of it,
believe me.

01:21:36.193 --> 01:21:37.126
Casey...

01:21:37.194 --> 01:21:39.993
lam the president of
"Dana should get undressed."

01:21:40.064 --> 01:21:42.396
-- Thank you. -- I don't think you
should do it in a restaurant --

01:21:42.466 --> 01:21:43.592
But w-what
am I talking about?

01:21:43.667 --> 01:21:44.998
Go ahead, do it
in a restaurant.

01:21:45.102 --> 01:21:47.696
I'm just saying I wish
you were doing it with me

01:21:47.738 --> 01:21:49.968
instead of Guillermo
from your Spanish club.

01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:51.974
L-| wish I didn't have
to wait through

01:21:52.042 --> 01:21:54.943
this heart-stoppingly frustrating
6-month waiting period

01:21:55.012 --> 01:21:58.414
before I even get to smell what
perfume you'd wear on our first date.

01:21:58.482 --> 01:21:59.881
[Breathes deeply]

01:21:59.950 --> 01:22:04.012
I wish it was me you were
having dinner with tonight.

01:22:06.524 --> 01:22:08.219
That's all.

01:22:08.292 --> 01:22:11.262
[Breathes deeply]

01:22:11.328 --> 01:22:12.557
Let's go back inside.

01:22:12.630 --> 01:22:14.621
-- Really?
-- Yeah.

01:22:14.698 --> 01:22:16.962
You really understand?

01:22:17.034 --> 01:22:19.765
Yeah, of course
I understand.

01:22:21.305 --> 01:22:22.636
[Knocks on glass]

01:22:25.543 --> 01:22:27.033
Come with me.

01:22:27.111 --> 01:22:31.048
Uh, we've only got
90 seconds.

01:22:34.618 --> 01:22:37.679
VVell, I guess the only thing for me
to do is write a letter of my own.

01:22:37.755 --> 01:22:39.189
-- To your sister?
-- To your father.

01:22:39.256 --> 01:22:41.691
-- Jeremy... -- I've decided to
become buddies with your father.

01:22:41.759 --> 01:22:42.851
That's not funny.

01:22:42.927 --> 01:22:44.053
Where's Casey?

01:22:44.128 --> 01:22:45.220
Someplace with Dana.

01:22:45.329 --> 01:22:47.320
How's that Internet poll
going, Dan?

01:22:47.364 --> 01:22:49.560
Don't think I'm not
on to you, my friend.

01:22:49.633 --> 01:22:51.863
I spent seven hours
looking for the ignition keys.

01:22:51.936 --> 01:22:54.735
-- <i>Jeremy...</i> -- <i>Today, I take
care of all family business.</i>

<i>Dave: 60 seconds back.</i>

Look in your top drawer.

-- Is there an animal in there? -- Why
would there be an animal in there?

01:23:09.954 --> 01:23:11.513
'Cause last time, there
was an animal in there.

01:23:11.589 --> 01:23:13.023
Look in your top drawer.

01:23:22.099 --> 01:23:24.329
So you have something
to look forward to.

I'll keep these,
if you don't mind.

I don't mind a bit.

Sam, everything's cool.
