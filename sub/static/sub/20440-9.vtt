WEBVTT

00:05.273 --> 00:07.708
This is Air 3. We're over
here at the help call.

00:07.775 --> 00:10.244
Be advised,we have one male
downin the driveway.

00:10.311 --> 00:11.912
Advise rescue team
to respond,

00:11.979 --> 00:13.581
westbound to Bowcroft.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.619
Rescue team be advised,
possible sniper threat

00:18.686 --> 00:21.122
is in the hils south of
the victim's location.

00:36.003 --> 00:37.805
All right, move!

00:37.871 --> 00:39.340
Eyes on the hills.

01:03.197 --> 01:08.102
- Mount up! Mount up!
- Spread out! Go!

01:29.757 --> 01:31.692
**

01:52.079 --> 01:54.982
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

01:55.048 --> 01:57.551
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

01:57.618 --> 02:00.454
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

02:00.521 --> 02:02.556
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

02:02.623 --> 02:05.626
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

02:05.693 --> 02:07.895
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

02:07.961 --> 02:10.864
* I got a feeling
that I can't let go *

02:10.931 --> 02:12.733
* I can't let go *

02:25.145 --> 02:27.581
* I feel *

02:38.726 --> 02:40.761
Hell of a shot.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.265
Not for these guys.

03:13.294 --> 03:14.395
Chief.

03:14.462 --> 03:15.929
Thought you'd be
at the hospital.

03:15.996 --> 03:17.931
On my way.

03:17.998 --> 03:20.268
Wanted to see
the scene first.

03:20.334 --> 03:23.271
Yeah, me, too.

03:23.337 --> 03:24.605
Chief of D's filled me in.

03:24.672 --> 03:26.607
This connected
to the man who got killed?

03:26.674 --> 03:29.943
Yeah, we got a BOLO out
on his two asshole buddies.

03:30.010 --> 03:33.281
Ex-Army, Special Forces.

03:33.347 --> 03:34.948
One of them's
a decorated sniper.

03:40.354 --> 03:42.256
Clear shot.

03:42.323 --> 03:44.425
A miracle
he wasn't killed.

03:44.492 --> 03:47.094
First shot hit Jerry
in the shoulder.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.997
Second one blew out
the windows instead
of his head.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.199
He scrambled to the front.

03:52.266 --> 03:54.134
Third one was right on target.

03:54.201 --> 03:56.304
Stopped by the engine block.

03:56.370 --> 03:58.472
His training kicked in.

03:58.539 --> 04:01.975
Jerry did just
what he was supposed to do.

04:02.042 --> 04:04.378
- What's that?
- That...

04:04.445 --> 04:07.315
is an old
Special Forces trick.

04:07.381 --> 04:09.917
You walk over,
reach to pick it up...

04:09.983 --> 04:13.220
But he didn't pick it up.

04:13.287 --> 04:15.689
It saved his life.

04:18.191 --> 04:19.327
Any word?

04:20.394 --> 04:21.795
He'll live.

04:21.862 --> 04:24.164
Cautiously optimistic
they can save the arm.

04:24.231 --> 04:28.336
Cautiously optimistic.

04:28.402 --> 04:30.838
What else can you be?

04:37.778 --> 04:40.180
Come on.

04:45.753 --> 04:48.522
This hour, an audacious
sniper attack

04:48.589 --> 04:50.691
in broad daylight
in Baldwin Hills

04:50.758 --> 04:53.827
on a veteran LAPD detective
outside his home.

04:53.894 --> 04:56.997
Police have not released
the name of this officer,

04:57.064 --> 04:59.533
and no word yet
on his condition.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.535
Police are searching
for two individuals

05:01.602 --> 05:03.371
described as
persons of interest.

05:03.437 --> 05:05.673
- Fuck me.
- In other news...

05:05.739 --> 05:07.741
Fuck.

05:13.647 --> 05:14.515
Sorry.

05:14.582 --> 05:16.384
The fuck's going on?

05:16.450 --> 05:18.919
- Where's Bosch?
- We got a situation.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.253
All hell's breaking loose.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.922
What about my brother?

05:21.989 --> 05:23.391
That's what I'm saying.

05:23.457 --> 05:24.492
Everything's on hold.

05:24.558 --> 05:26.394
We got an officer down.

05:26.460 --> 05:28.662
- Who?
- Jerry Edgar.

05:28.729 --> 05:32.232
Jesus Christ.
How is he?

05:32.299 --> 05:34.568
Too soon to tell.

05:36.269 --> 05:39.940
Listen, you can hang on
a little while longer
or come back tomorrow.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.141
It's up to you.

05:41.208 --> 05:44.211
I've waited this long.

05:44.277 --> 05:46.079
I can hang
a little longer.

05:46.146 --> 05:49.883
Okay.
Get you another coffee?

05:49.950 --> 05:53.821
Yeah. This time go easy
on the fucking sugar.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.456
Yeah.

06:06.634 --> 06:09.403
The shot shattered
his shoulder blade.

06:09.470 --> 06:10.404
They're piecing it
back together

06:10.471 --> 06:11.605
with screws and plates.

06:11.672 --> 06:12.773
Shit.

06:12.840 --> 06:15.208
- They still optimistic?
- Yeah. Yeah, they are.

06:15.275 --> 06:16.910
Best case scenario,
if all goes well

06:16.977 --> 06:18.579
and he's religious
about his PT--

06:18.646 --> 06:20.614
You know he will be.

06:20.681 --> 06:23.116
Six months before
he regains full use
and mobility.

06:25.519 --> 06:28.088
He's going to be riding
a desk for awhile.

06:31.191 --> 06:32.493
I have to give a statement.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.462
That's what they pay you
the big bucks for.

06:48.208 --> 06:49.543
- Bosch.
- Detective?

06:49.610 --> 06:51.111
Hector, Archer's Towing.

06:51.178 --> 06:53.914
Shit. I've been meaning
to get over there.

06:53.981 --> 06:55.949
Love to get this
damn thing out of here.

06:56.016 --> 06:59.352
Keep it locked up tight.
I'll be over there
tomorrow at the latest.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.655
- All right.
- And Hector?

07:01.722 --> 07:03.657
- Sir?
- It's evidence.

07:03.724 --> 07:06.093
- Got it?
- Got it.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.169
Fuck this.

07:20.908 --> 07:22.209
Police presence
is on the ground,

07:22.275 --> 07:23.744
and we know at least
one sniper...

07:23.811 --> 07:26.680
Where is everyone?
All hands on deck?

07:26.747 --> 07:28.616
Full court press
to find the shooter.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.651
And they left you behind
to baby-sit?

07:30.718 --> 07:33.353
Yeah, somebody
has to mind the store.

07:33.420 --> 07:35.856
This is bullshit.
I've been here all day.

07:35.923 --> 07:38.191
I'll be back in the morning
to get my brother...

07:38.258 --> 07:39.693
with a lawyer.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.229
Suit yourself.
I'll walk you out.

07:44.264 --> 07:47.000
We got Jesse on tape--

07:47.067 --> 07:51.071
surveillance cam at Gunn's
the night he was killed.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.072
Bullshit.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.074
Hey, just saying.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.743
Might want to stick around.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.741
The wireless
customer you're calling
is not available.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.943
Please hang up
and try your call again.

08:37.184 --> 08:40.588
- Jimmy?
- Hey.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.590
- Tafero?
- He's still with us.

08:42.656 --> 08:45.392
Oh, he must be
fully marinated by now.

08:45.458 --> 08:46.760
Nice and tender. Shall we?

08:46.827 --> 08:49.129
- You give me a minute?
- Sure.

08:52.332 --> 08:53.767
All right. All right.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.435
Well, that's great news.
Thanks.

08:55.502 --> 08:57.270
Keep me posted.

08:57.337 --> 08:58.772
He's out of surgery.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.540
He's in recovery.
They say it went well.

09:00.608 --> 09:03.543
He's going to be
setting off metal detectors
for the rest of his life.

09:03.611 --> 09:06.246
Yeah. Well, he's very lucky.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.115
One way to look at it.

09:08.181 --> 09:10.317
What is the other way?

09:10.383 --> 09:12.319
He got shot
by a sniper, Grace.

09:12.385 --> 09:15.088
Look, we are all upset
about Jerry,

09:15.155 --> 09:17.124
but we've got to
look at the glass
as half full here.

09:17.190 --> 09:18.491
What else is going on?

09:18.558 --> 09:20.961
Crate and Barrel
are down in Baja.

09:21.028 --> 09:23.797
They have made arrangements
to raid Moreno's boat
in the morning.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.465
That glass is going to
come up empty.

09:25.532 --> 09:26.800
Moreno's not there.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.537
So what's on your agenda?

09:30.604 --> 09:31.605
I'm about to have at Tafero.

09:31.672 --> 09:35.342
Well, have at him.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.344
...this is an active
crime scene,

09:37.410 --> 09:39.312
- Jimmy?
- there no longer appears
to be any threat.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.659
Sorry to keep you waiting,
Rudy. Hands full.

09:51.725 --> 09:53.827
Spare me.
How's Edgar?

09:53.894 --> 09:55.829
He's going to be okay.

09:55.896 --> 10:00.133
Thank Christ for that.
Always liked him.

10:00.200 --> 10:05.673
So can we get to it?
This tape Robertson's
talking about?

10:13.914 --> 10:18.752
It's legit.
That's your brother.

10:18.819 --> 10:21.521
Looks kind of like him.

10:21.588 --> 10:23.323
Jury would agree,

10:23.390 --> 10:25.325
especially with his
fingerprints on the door.

10:25.392 --> 10:29.062
- The other guy's you.
- Good luck proving that.

10:31.098 --> 10:33.801
He could be right.
We know Jesse won't flip.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.703
That's right. He won't.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.570
I'd worry about Jesse
taking the weight though,

10:37.637 --> 10:39.873
- wouldn't you?
- I would.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.374
Doesn't strike me
as all that tough.

10:41.441 --> 10:42.876
I mean, murder for hire,

10:42.943 --> 10:43.877
that's what we're
looking at, right?

10:43.944 --> 10:45.679
L-WOP, Life without parole.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.547
- Most definitely.
- That's a heavy door,
brother.

10:47.614 --> 10:49.516
Slams shut, stays shut.

10:49.582 --> 10:52.452
Quit trying to play me.
I know the game.

10:52.519 --> 10:53.754
You want your phone call?

10:55.789 --> 10:57.257
I'll let you know.

11:04.631 --> 11:06.934
So how did it go?

11:09.469 --> 11:10.704
Going to let him
stew a little.

11:10.771 --> 11:12.205
Do you think
he'll lawyer-up?

11:12.272 --> 11:14.908
Might. He knows
he shouldn't talk to us.

11:14.975 --> 11:16.744
We got him thinking
about his brother.

11:16.810 --> 11:18.578
And cops,
sometimes they're caught,

11:18.645 --> 11:19.913
they want to lay it all out,

11:19.980 --> 11:22.349
tell it there way.
You know, get in front of it.

11:22.415 --> 11:25.085
He thinks he's going to get
something for his baby bro?

11:25.152 --> 11:27.154
It might put him
in a talkative mood.

11:27.220 --> 11:30.057
Well, I'll call Benitez,
ask her to talk to O'Shea

11:30.123 --> 11:31.959
about the flying
Tafero Brothers.

11:36.296 --> 11:38.966
You got time?
I'm going to grab some dinner.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.235
Why not?

11:42.302 --> 11:44.872
Was Detective Edgar
able to call for help?

11:51.511 --> 11:53.613
Irv.

11:53.680 --> 11:54.782
Bradley.

11:54.848 --> 11:56.249
Sorry I'm late.

11:56.316 --> 11:59.119
- No worries.
- What can I get you?

11:59.186 --> 12:02.455
Uh...
I'll have what he's having.

12:02.522 --> 12:03.957
What are you having?

12:04.024 --> 12:07.160
Hibiki.
Japanese whiskey.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.463
I'll have one of those,
straight up.

12:12.866 --> 12:14.001
We could have rescheduled.

12:14.067 --> 12:18.138
No, this is good.
I needed a break.

12:18.205 --> 12:20.808
Must have had
quite the day.

12:20.874 --> 12:21.975
How's your man?

12:22.042 --> 12:23.410
He's going to make it.

12:23.476 --> 12:26.780
Hell of a thing
when the police are targeted.

12:26.847 --> 12:30.350
Hope we're not in
for another round
of cop killings.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.418
Dallas, Baton Rouge--

12:31.484 --> 12:35.288
- This was personal.
- You know who?

12:35.355 --> 12:37.657
The man that got shot
in Venice?

12:37.724 --> 12:39.492
One of his compadres.
Payback.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.663
- Thank you.
- Yeah, my pleasure.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.065
Chin, chin.

12:51.238 --> 12:52.672
Shall we get
the bad news out of the way

12:52.739 --> 12:54.875
so we can enjoy our dinner?

12:59.579 --> 13:02.515
Actually...

13:02.582 --> 13:03.550
I've reconsidered.

13:03.616 --> 13:06.019
Ah, don't toy
with me, Irv.

13:06.086 --> 13:10.223
I accept the offer,
if it's still good.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.458
Of course it is.

13:11.524 --> 13:14.227
Of course it's still good.

13:15.662 --> 13:19.699
Fantastic. I'm delighted.

13:19.766 --> 13:23.336
The mayor will be thrilled.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.538
Does he know?

13:25.605 --> 13:27.140
I wanted to tell you first.

13:34.114 --> 13:38.051
Yeah, extra-- extra spicy.

13:38.118 --> 13:41.554
- You ever work with him?
- Rudy?

13:41.621 --> 13:44.157
Once. I'd just made rank.

13:44.224 --> 13:47.861
- Was he bent back then?
- Like a crowbar.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.729
He used to keep
this old search warrant

13:49.796 --> 13:51.364
in his glove compartment.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.867
He'd flash it when he wanted
to get in somewhere

13:53.934 --> 13:56.369
without going through
the niceties.

13:56.436 --> 13:57.938
Did he use it
when he worked with you?

13:58.005 --> 13:59.439
He tried.

13:59.506 --> 14:00.874
I told him to put it back
in his glove compartment

14:00.941 --> 14:02.242
or I'd stick it up his ass.

14:02.309 --> 14:04.577
One and only time
I ever worked with him.

14:11.818 --> 14:14.754
Benitez is at the front desk.

14:14.821 --> 14:15.989
Let's go.

14:21.161 --> 14:22.429
You talk to O'Shea?

14:22.495 --> 14:25.598
Let's see what
Mr. Tafero has to say.

14:27.834 --> 14:30.870
- It's your case.
- Gunn was yours first.

14:49.856 --> 14:54.227
- Rudy.
- Bosch. Back so soon?

14:54.294 --> 14:55.963
Ms. Benitez.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.965
What's your pleasure?

14:58.031 --> 15:00.133
Let's get the formalities
out of the way.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.202
- No call?
- No call.

15:02.269 --> 15:04.671
You know your rights.
You want to talk to us?

15:06.339 --> 15:07.207
Sitting in?

15:07.274 --> 15:10.677
You know how this works,
Mr. Tafero.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.412
Come clean and cooperate.

15:12.479 --> 15:15.315
If you give us
some good evidence
against Andrew Holland,

15:15.382 --> 15:17.317
we'll go to a judge,
and you and your brother

15:17.384 --> 15:19.152
can plead this down
from life to something

15:19.219 --> 15:21.088
with a little daylight
at the end of it.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.324
Jesse.

15:24.391 --> 15:26.826
I should've drafted
some other knucklehead,

15:26.893 --> 15:28.828
left him out of it.

15:28.895 --> 15:31.331
I met Holland at our place,

15:31.398 --> 15:32.865
helped him
move the body upstairs.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.335
- Holland?
- Andrew Holland.

15:35.402 --> 15:40.473
- Who's body?
- Donatella Spear.

15:40.540 --> 15:43.476
He said it was an accident.
Rough sex.

15:43.543 --> 15:46.346
Slippery slope,
working for Holland.

15:46.413 --> 15:48.348
- Judging me, Harry?
- No.

15:48.415 --> 15:52.652
- Bullshit.
- Not my job.

15:52.719 --> 15:57.157
Admit it.
If we hadn't done Gunn,
you would have.

15:57.224 --> 15:59.559
- I did you a favor.
- Cut the shit, Rudy.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.394
Walk me through it.

16:05.432 --> 16:08.868
Jesse buddied up to Gunn,
befriended him.

16:08.935 --> 16:11.538
Buy him drinks,
drive him home.

16:11.604 --> 16:15.208
The night it was originally
supposed to go down,

16:15.275 --> 16:17.510
he was going to get him drunk,
drive him home,

16:17.577 --> 16:20.513
and he'd take a header
over the balcony.

16:20.580 --> 16:23.050
- But it didn't happen.
- Why not?

16:23.116 --> 16:25.385
Jesse bought him
one drink too many.

16:27.287 --> 16:31.424
Gunn got shit-faced.
Obstreperous.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.593
Got his ass
tossed in the can.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.595
Who bailed him out?

16:37.264 --> 16:42.035
- Marissa Mattas.
- The woman in red,
works for Holland.

16:42.102 --> 16:45.238
She doesn't know
anything, Bosch.

16:45.305 --> 16:48.241
- Keep her out of this.
- That's up to you.

16:48.308 --> 16:49.742
But she bailed Gunn out.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.882
By the time she got him home,
it was almost dawn.

16:55.948 --> 16:59.619
We called it off.

16:59.686 --> 17:02.422
Tell me about the night of.

17:02.489 --> 17:04.324
We pull up, Jesse's driving.

17:04.391 --> 17:06.726
- The Cadillac.
- Caddy, yeah.

17:06.793 --> 17:09.262
- Jesse loves 'em.
- You boosted it.

17:09.329 --> 17:10.897
Happy to cop
to grand theft auto

17:10.963 --> 17:12.565
if you want to drop
the rest of the beef.

17:12.632 --> 17:15.102
- Go on.
- We get our stuff

17:15.168 --> 17:16.103
out of the trunk
of the car

17:16.169 --> 17:17.404
and we head upstairs.

17:17.470 --> 17:19.439
I'm sure it's all
on the tape.

17:19.506 --> 17:21.508
Tell me what happens inside
after the tape.

17:21.574 --> 17:24.811
I didn't see it,
so clue me.

17:24.877 --> 17:28.748
You're at the door.

17:28.815 --> 17:32.452
We're at the door.
We kill the light,

17:32.519 --> 17:34.654
pick the lock,
slip the chain.

17:34.721 --> 17:37.124
1, 2, 3, we're inside.

17:37.190 --> 17:42.129
Gunn is four fucking
sheets to the wind.

17:42.195 --> 17:45.165
Sees Jesse,
thinks we've come to party.

17:48.735 --> 17:51.504
We help him write the note.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.673
"I'm sorry."

17:53.740 --> 17:54.807
No problem.

17:58.878 --> 18:01.181
But then
the nickel drops and...

18:02.682 --> 18:04.451
he balks at
going out on the deck.

18:04.517 --> 18:07.854
- I bet.
- Clawing at the wall.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.324
I put the restraint on him
and he's out,

18:11.391 --> 18:13.726
quiet as a baby.

18:13.793 --> 18:16.529
So he's out. What then?

18:19.899 --> 18:21.701
Head first.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.004
"Swock."

18:25.071 --> 18:27.006
You know, the sound
a watermelon makes

18:27.073 --> 18:28.107
when it hits the pavement.

18:28.175 --> 18:30.009
Hard to lift
that much dead weight

18:30.076 --> 18:32.845
over the balcony rail
by yourself.

18:35.081 --> 18:38.518
My brother stayed inside.

18:38.585 --> 18:41.421
He never laid a hand on Gunn.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.858
Tell me about the frame-up,

18:45.925 --> 18:47.594
my prints on the glass.

18:47.660 --> 18:51.264
You're a creature
of habit, Bosch.

18:51.331 --> 18:52.832
El Compadre.

18:52.899 --> 18:55.202
Filched your glass
one night at the bar.

18:55.268 --> 18:57.204
- Jesse?
- Right behind you.

18:57.270 --> 18:58.471
You never knew
he was there.

18:58.538 --> 19:01.208
Okay, so you put me
at the scene.

19:01.274 --> 19:02.675
Why not just choke Gunn out?

19:02.742 --> 19:05.478
Why pitch him off the balcony?
Why the owl?

19:05.545 --> 19:09.216
Andrew Holland had a script--

19:09.282 --> 19:11.851
the fall of Hieronymus Bosch.

19:11.918 --> 19:14.354
Jesus.

19:14.421 --> 19:16.055
You think we would
ever in a million years

19:16.122 --> 19:18.691
have thought about
the fucking owl?

19:18.758 --> 19:22.429
That was Holland talking
directly to you, Bosch.

19:23.963 --> 19:26.233
He literally drew it up.

19:26.299 --> 19:28.701
- Drew it up?
- Storyboards.

19:28.768 --> 19:31.170
Little drawings like
he was directing a movie.

19:31.238 --> 19:32.872
You had them with you
that night.

19:32.939 --> 19:37.244
Had to. Had to make sure
the owl was in exactly
the right place.

19:37.310 --> 19:40.913
Little prick
is really particular.

19:40.980 --> 19:44.251
You kept them, didn't you?

19:44.317 --> 19:46.919
The storyboards?

19:46.986 --> 19:48.455
Just in case.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.268
Look at us.

20:01.334 --> 20:04.637
Look at us, Bosch,
still humping this shit.

20:08.007 --> 20:09.742
I am.

20:09.809 --> 20:13.112
What I see is you're on
the other side of the table.

20:13.179 --> 20:15.448
Come a long way, Rudy,

20:15.515 --> 20:18.050
from ripping off drug dealers
to murder for hire.

20:18.117 --> 20:20.720
You want a reason?

20:20.787 --> 20:22.221
You got one?

20:35.001 --> 20:37.136
- So what about Holland?
- We need more.

20:37.203 --> 20:39.472
Just what I was
about to say.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.140
You think he'll continue
to cooperate?

20:41.207 --> 20:44.677
To get to Holland?
He'll cooperate.

20:44.744 --> 20:47.113
I'm going to go
write the warrant
for the Taferos.

20:47.179 --> 20:50.016
I'll call Judge Andrews,
tell him to expect you.

20:55.187 --> 20:59.326
You know, Harry,
I'd really like it
if we stayed friends.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.861
What's the point?

21:54.113 --> 21:55.415
Where are you?

21:56.749 --> 21:57.684
TJ.

21:59.786 --> 22:03.255
Tijuana? Wow.
How'd you get across?

22:03.322 --> 22:06.292
Cousin in San Diego.
Fishing boat.

22:06.359 --> 22:08.227
Going to run me
down to Baja tomorrow.

22:08.294 --> 22:09.496
I've been trying
to reach you all day.

22:09.562 --> 22:12.198
I had my phone off.
Security.

22:12.264 --> 22:14.100
Really brought the heat.

22:14.166 --> 22:17.036
I know.

22:17.103 --> 22:18.405
Told you to let it go.

22:18.471 --> 22:20.006
I had to try, captain.

22:20.072 --> 22:22.409
Couldn't live with myself.

22:22.475 --> 22:25.144
What's done is done.
Good luck.

22:25.211 --> 22:29.248
You, too.
On your way north?

22:29.315 --> 22:32.051
Just about.

22:32.118 --> 22:34.754
Going to take a look
for Woody's share
on my way out.

22:34.821 --> 22:37.123
It's too bad you're in Baja
or you could come with.

22:37.189 --> 22:39.426
You got a line on that?

22:39.492 --> 22:40.660
I thought the cops had it.

22:40.727 --> 22:42.429
Well, I got to thinking

22:42.495 --> 22:45.097
maybe he stashed
most of it somewhere.

22:45.164 --> 22:46.499
One of his surf camps maybe.

22:46.566 --> 22:48.768
You know where?

22:48.835 --> 22:51.871
Got a couple ideas.
We'll see if they pan out.

22:51.938 --> 22:54.206
If I find it,
I'll send you your half.

22:54.273 --> 22:55.808
Roger that.

22:57.877 --> 23:00.112
I better go...

23:00.179 --> 23:01.814
in case anyone's tracking this.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.483
Smart.

23:06.352 --> 23:07.854
You're a good man, captain.

23:47.226 --> 23:48.995
"Buenos diaz, senior-rita."

23:49.061 --> 23:52.031
Detective Ruiz,
it's all yours.

23:52.098 --> 23:53.032
Thank you, detective.

23:57.003 --> 23:59.271
Whoa.

24:07.246 --> 24:10.683
- Hey.
- Hi, Harry.

24:10.750 --> 24:12.685
- How you doing, LaTonya?
- Okay.

24:12.752 --> 24:14.086
- Maddie.
- Hi.

24:14.153 --> 24:15.822
Look at you, all grown up.

24:15.888 --> 24:20.760
- The boys?
- Better now they know
he's going to be okay.

24:20.827 --> 24:22.495
How's Jerry doing
this morning?

24:22.562 --> 24:23.996
He's good, considering.

24:24.063 --> 24:25.998
He's a little zonked
from the drugs.

24:26.065 --> 24:28.701
- Thank you for coming.
- Of course.

24:28.768 --> 24:31.070
- Don't stay too long.
- Oh, we won't.

24:34.541 --> 24:37.544
Sorry. Chief, this is
my daughter Maddie.

24:37.610 --> 24:39.546
- This is Chief Irving.
- Nice to meet you.

24:39.612 --> 24:40.713
I've heard
a lot about you.

24:40.780 --> 24:43.015
Well, don't believe it.

24:43.082 --> 24:44.717
Maddie, would you
please excuse us?

24:44.784 --> 24:46.052
I need a quick word
with your dad.

24:46.118 --> 24:48.387
- I'll wait over here.
- Thank you.

24:48.454 --> 24:49.922
I'll be right back.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.593
Chief.

24:54.961 --> 24:56.896
Look, I wanted you to know

24:56.963 --> 24:59.766
that IA complaint
will come back unfounded.

24:59.832 --> 25:03.035
It was bullshit anyway.

25:03.102 --> 25:06.372
I believe the appropriate
response is thank you.

25:06.438 --> 25:07.907
For quashing a bogus complaint

25:07.974 --> 25:11.043
that never should have been
filed in the first place?

25:11.110 --> 25:15.081
- It's called doing your job.
- Okay.

25:15.147 --> 25:16.583
I don't owe you.

25:16.649 --> 25:19.919
Call it even.

25:36.202 --> 25:37.303
Jerry.

25:41.507 --> 25:44.410
Hey. Hey, Maddie.

25:44.476 --> 25:45.912
Hey, Jerry.

25:48.214 --> 25:49.181
What a surprise.

25:49.248 --> 25:51.618
How you feeling, partner?

25:51.684 --> 25:53.786
Feeling no pain.

25:53.853 --> 25:55.087
That'll come later.

25:55.154 --> 25:57.289
No doubt.

25:59.859 --> 26:01.694
You know,
it hurts getting shot.

26:01.761 --> 26:03.562
It hurts like a bastard.

26:03.630 --> 26:07.166
Always wondered. Now I know.

26:10.236 --> 26:12.338
We just wanted to say hi.

26:12.404 --> 26:15.642
Hmm. I'm glad you did.

26:15.708 --> 26:18.477
We're going to split,
but I'm going to come
check you out tomorrow.

26:18.544 --> 26:19.846
- Good?
- Okay.

26:19.912 --> 26:22.815
- See you, Jerry.
- Bye, Maddie.

26:22.882 --> 26:24.851
- Harry?
- Yeah?

26:27.720 --> 26:30.289
I know about the cameras.

26:30.356 --> 26:34.894
Jerry, did you say something?

26:37.897 --> 26:39.932
I know about the cameras.

26:57.917 --> 26:59.518
It's scary
seeing him like that.

26:59.585 --> 27:01.353
I know.

27:03.289 --> 27:04.623
Still want to be a cop?

27:06.425 --> 27:07.760
I think so.

27:07.827 --> 27:10.162
It's a big decision, Mads,

27:10.229 --> 27:12.699
and you can change your mind
any time along the way.

27:12.765 --> 27:14.333
I won't judge you.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.235
Yeah, I know.

27:18.938 --> 27:20.372
What did he say
to you in there?

27:20.439 --> 27:22.775
Couldn't make it out.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.789
Where the fuck have you been?

27:36.856 --> 27:39.726
- Taking care of business.
- For 24 hours?

27:39.792 --> 27:41.894
Not a word?

27:41.961 --> 27:44.196
Your sweetie
has been worried sick.

27:44.263 --> 27:45.631
- Haven't you?
- Not so much.

27:45.698 --> 27:49.401
- Well, I have.
- Relax.

27:49.468 --> 27:51.070
It's under control.

27:51.137 --> 27:54.406
Are you on speaker?
Why are you on speaker?

27:54.473 --> 27:56.909
Working.

27:56.976 --> 27:58.244
I'm on my laptop.

27:58.310 --> 28:00.780
Well quit looking
at porn while we talk.

28:00.847 --> 28:04.650
You want me to take us off?

28:04.717 --> 28:06.585
Yes, yes!
Please, take us off.

28:06.652 --> 28:08.287
I hate speaker.

28:10.522 --> 28:14.927
- Is that better?
- Much. Your brother?

28:14.994 --> 28:17.797
He's a stand-up guy,
and he stood up.

28:18.998 --> 28:22.401
- Is he out?
- As of this morning.

28:22.468 --> 28:25.805
Why I'm just now calling.
Where's the case at?

28:25.872 --> 28:29.942
We start jury selection
next week.

28:30.009 --> 28:34.881
Personally, I think
the people are going to cave.

28:36.682 --> 28:38.951
Maybe I should
come by tonight.

28:39.018 --> 28:42.154
I have something for you
that may seal the deal.

28:42.221 --> 28:44.423
Uh...

28:47.193 --> 28:49.428
all right.
Come after 8.

28:49.495 --> 28:51.630
I have a massage at 6?
Yeah, come after 8.

28:51.697 --> 28:55.167
- After 8.
- Eight's perfect.

28:59.538 --> 29:01.140
I get to go home, I hope?

29:01.207 --> 29:05.644
- Change?
- Shower, shave, the works.

29:05.711 --> 29:07.814
And pick up
the storyboards.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.816
We took care of that
last night.

29:09.882 --> 29:11.818
You searched my house?

29:11.884 --> 29:13.185
Holland know you have them?

29:15.855 --> 29:20.292
I returned them the day after,
but then I got to thinking,

29:20.359 --> 29:22.929
maybe I needed
a little insurance.

29:22.995 --> 29:25.497
So I stole 'em.

29:27.900 --> 29:30.837
Any chance I can speak
with my brother?

29:30.903 --> 29:34.773
He's been transferred
downtown.

29:39.912 --> 29:43.850
Ida, would you reconfirm
my reservation?

29:43.916 --> 29:45.852
Two for 7:30?

29:45.918 --> 29:48.054
- Thank you.
- Sure.

30:43.142 --> 30:44.776
I'm telling you, Rudy,

30:44.843 --> 30:48.380
we are this close
to no jail time

30:48.447 --> 30:51.918
or getting the case
dismissed outright.

30:51.984 --> 30:54.120
Good for you.

30:55.321 --> 30:57.589
Can't wait to get rid
of this fucking thing

30:57.656 --> 31:00.026
and get back to work.

31:02.661 --> 31:04.463
You know the irony
of all this?

31:04.530 --> 31:05.564
No, what?

31:05.631 --> 31:09.268
This fucking nightmare

31:09.335 --> 31:12.471
will turn out to be
a great career move.

31:16.008 --> 31:18.877
Everybody's going to want
to be in business with me.

31:21.847 --> 31:23.149
What you got there?

31:24.550 --> 31:25.517
Your next movie.

31:27.853 --> 31:31.290
I write my own material, man.

31:31.357 --> 31:34.961
You know how often
people pitch me shit?

31:35.027 --> 31:38.797
It's just an idea.
I was inspired.

31:38.864 --> 31:40.967
- By?
- The owl.

31:41.033 --> 31:43.635
The whole Bosch
artist angle,

31:43.702 --> 31:44.836
it was genius.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.573
It worked, didn't it?

31:47.639 --> 31:49.175
Like a charm.

31:51.210 --> 31:52.611
If you're not interested...

31:56.548 --> 31:58.617
So show me.

31:58.684 --> 32:01.520
Did you do storyboards
for Donatella?

32:01.587 --> 32:04.456
No.

32:04.523 --> 32:06.658
That was more
spur of the moment.

32:06.725 --> 32:09.361
Pure improv.
I went with it.

32:09.428 --> 32:10.762
All the way.

32:10.829 --> 32:13.532
You have no idea.

32:16.068 --> 32:17.703
What a feeling.

32:17.769 --> 32:20.639
I can't imagine.

32:23.675 --> 32:24.643
So show me.

32:27.713 --> 32:30.216
I thought you might
want these back.

32:47.133 --> 32:50.236
- Fuck you.
- What?

32:50.302 --> 32:52.438
Are you fucking kidding me?

33:10.789 --> 33:12.724
What do you want?

33:12.791 --> 33:14.560
Make me an offer.

33:23.469 --> 33:26.138
I wish we knew what the fuck
was going on over there.

33:26.205 --> 33:29.708
Why isn't he wired for live?

33:29.775 --> 33:32.578
Talk to the mayor.
Get us more money.

33:44.990 --> 33:46.625
It's all there.

34:11.483 --> 34:14.953
Your case.
You do the honors.

34:15.020 --> 34:17.323
- Youngblood.
- You serious?

34:17.389 --> 34:18.957
Yep.

34:19.024 --> 34:20.292
Andrew Holland,
you're under arrest

34:20.359 --> 34:21.793
for the murder
of Edward Gunn.

34:21.860 --> 34:23.795
What?

34:23.862 --> 34:25.664
I want to call my attorney.

34:25.731 --> 34:26.665
I'll bet you do.

34:26.732 --> 34:29.301
Ouch. Hold on
a fucking second.

34:29.368 --> 34:32.304
Ouch! Fuck, that hurts, man.

34:32.371 --> 34:35.974
Hey! I want to talk
to my lawyer!

34:36.041 --> 34:37.809
I want my lawyer!

34:37.876 --> 34:39.811
Tafero, you motherfucker!

34:55.561 --> 34:56.295
Buy you a drink?

34:56.362 --> 34:57.729
- Depends.
- On.

34:57.796 --> 35:00.532
If I'm going to be
up all night writing.

35:00.599 --> 35:01.833
So buy me a drink.

35:05.937 --> 35:07.506
Come here for the ambiance?

35:07.573 --> 35:09.808
- This is where it started.
- This is where what started?

35:09.875 --> 35:12.144
- Thank you, darling.
- You got it.

35:12.211 --> 35:16.014
Why don't you
pull your notebook out, son?

35:16.081 --> 35:19.651
A month or so ago,
a guy named Jesse Tafero

35:19.718 --> 35:23.555
bought Edward Gunn
some drinks right here.

35:38.270 --> 35:42.040
- Captain.
- Xavi.

35:42.107 --> 35:43.442
I didn't hear you
come aboard.

35:43.509 --> 35:46.545
Thought I'd give you a hand,

35:46.612 --> 35:48.180
help you look
for Woody's piece.

35:48.247 --> 35:51.149
You should have called.
You almost missed me.

35:51.217 --> 35:54.085
Luckily, I didn't.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.554
How'd you find me?

35:55.621 --> 35:58.824
Captain,
you know my skill set.

35:58.890 --> 36:00.692
God damn.

36:00.759 --> 36:02.394
You came all the way
back from Baja.

36:02.461 --> 36:05.231
- TJ.
- Right. Right, right.

36:05.297 --> 36:06.398
I appreciate that.

36:06.465 --> 36:07.566
My cousin. No big deal.

36:07.633 --> 36:10.969
Well, let's go get it,
shall we?

36:11.036 --> 36:12.871
Aye, aye, captain.

36:25.116 --> 36:26.785
- Morning.
- Detective.

36:26.852 --> 36:28.254
Good morning.

36:28.320 --> 36:30.722
- Jimmy.
- Hey, Harry.

36:32.157 --> 36:35.294
- Late night?
- It got that way.

36:38.964 --> 36:41.267
Listen, there'll be
a story out today--

36:41.333 --> 36:44.636
Times' website,
the official version.

36:44.703 --> 36:45.737
Which is?

36:45.804 --> 36:49.741
Holland hired
the Taferos to do Gunn,

36:49.808 --> 36:51.610
throw shade on you
to get him off

36:51.677 --> 36:53.945
the Donatella Spear murder.

36:54.012 --> 36:55.747
They almost pulled it off.

36:55.814 --> 36:58.284
- Almost.
- Who's the story by?

36:58.350 --> 37:00.952
Scott Anderson.

37:01.019 --> 37:03.389
So you were the leak.

37:03.455 --> 37:07.293
I'll tell you my secret
if you tell me yours.

37:07.359 --> 37:08.494
I know there's more.

37:10.396 --> 37:11.963
Keep thinking that.

37:16.034 --> 37:17.669
I will.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.234
Fan mail from some flounder?

38:23.301 --> 38:25.371
A-ha.

38:25.437 --> 38:27.205
The conquering heroes return.

38:27.272 --> 38:30.175
Jesus.
You guys look pretty rough.

38:30.241 --> 38:33.211
- Ever tried mescal?
- That the one with the worm?

38:33.278 --> 38:35.381
- Yeah.
- Uh, no.

38:35.447 --> 38:39.050
Me neither,
but Alfredo Garcia here--

38:39.117 --> 38:41.086
We were celebrating.

38:41.152 --> 38:43.689
I had to pry him out
of a Mexican hoosegow.

38:43.755 --> 38:46.392
This close to
an international incident.

38:46.458 --> 38:48.059
He exaggerates.

38:48.126 --> 38:49.495
Turn up anything on the boat?

38:49.561 --> 38:52.398
Just a couple million bucks.

38:52.464 --> 38:54.232
- Weapons?
- No.

38:54.299 --> 38:56.868
- Any sign of Moreno?
- Not yet.

38:56.935 --> 38:58.870
You happen to see
Scott Anderson's
column this morning?

38:58.937 --> 39:02.240
- No.
- Exclusive on
the Holland bust.

39:02.307 --> 39:04.876
- That was fast.
- Yeah, internal source.

39:04.943 --> 39:08.414
- Right.
- Yeah, it gives Robertson
all the credit.

39:08.480 --> 39:10.281
It's his case.
Let him have it.

39:10.348 --> 39:13.619
Hey, Harry,
who are the slicks?

39:15.153 --> 39:16.888
Do I know? FID?

39:16.955 --> 39:18.390
Maybe something
to do with Edgar.

39:18.457 --> 39:20.626
FID don't dress that good.

39:32.504 --> 39:34.806
I guess I'm about
to find out.

39:34.873 --> 39:38.109
Hey, Harry, you know
Bennett and Pell from RHD.

39:39.678 --> 39:43.081
- Only by reputation.
- Good I hope.

39:43.148 --> 39:47.453
They're working
the riverwatch arson case.

39:47.519 --> 39:48.920
- So it was arson.
- That's the ruling,

39:48.987 --> 39:50.589
but we haven't gone
public with it yet.

39:50.656 --> 39:52.624
We have some questions
about the deceased,

39:52.691 --> 39:54.325
retired detective
John Caffrey.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.294
Caffrey was the target?

39:56.361 --> 39:57.896
Origin point
of the fire was his bed.

39:57.963 --> 39:59.931
Staged to look like
he fell asleep smoking,

39:59.998 --> 40:03.469
but the chemical analysis
shows the presence
of an accelerant.

40:03.535 --> 40:04.903
Was he alive
when the fire started?

40:04.970 --> 40:07.105
Can't say.
The body was so badly burned,

40:07.172 --> 40:08.607
we may never know
the cause of death.

40:08.674 --> 40:10.041
The apartment was gutted,

40:10.108 --> 40:12.177
but we have
the front desk visitor logs.

40:12.243 --> 40:13.479
You were a regular visitor

40:13.545 --> 40:14.946
during the seven years
he lived there.

40:15.013 --> 40:17.649
I was. He was lead
on my mother's murder, '79.

40:17.716 --> 40:19.485
It was unsolved,
and I visited him

40:19.551 --> 40:21.152
every few months
to pick his brain about it.

40:21.219 --> 40:22.988
A year and a half ago
you stopped visiting him?

40:23.054 --> 40:24.623
Yeah, I cleared the case.

40:24.690 --> 40:27.693
Your mother was
Marjorie Phillips Lowe?

40:29.160 --> 40:30.095
That's right.

40:32.430 --> 40:35.133
The case is still
carried as open.

40:35.200 --> 40:37.969
I cleared it
to my satisfaction.
The killer's dead.

40:38.036 --> 40:40.305
I just never got around
to filing it cleared other.

40:40.371 --> 40:42.173
Did Caffrey
help you clear it?

40:42.240 --> 40:44.843
He did,
but he also revealed

40:44.910 --> 40:46.411
that he bowed
to departmental pressure

40:46.478 --> 40:47.979
to look the other way
at the time,

40:48.046 --> 40:50.749
so the killer
was never brought to justice
before he died.

40:50.816 --> 40:52.584
And why would
Caffrey do that?

40:54.219 --> 40:57.188
The killer was a high-level
snitch for Narcotics.

40:57.255 --> 40:59.357
My mother was just
a prostitute.

40:59.424 --> 41:01.426
He mattered, she didn't.

41:01.493 --> 41:06.532
So that's the real reason

41:06.598 --> 41:09.234
I stopped visiting him
a year and a half ago.

41:09.300 --> 41:12.838
Caffrey told you
he was pressured by
the department?

41:12.904 --> 41:15.473
- He did.
- He wasn't just covering
his own ass?

41:15.541 --> 41:17.809
I looked into it.
He was telling the truth.

41:17.876 --> 41:20.912
Thank you.
And thanks for your time.

41:24.950 --> 41:27.786
You know, Caffrey kept
a full murder book
on the case.

41:27.853 --> 41:29.354
Did he?

41:29.420 --> 41:31.056
You didn't know?

41:31.122 --> 41:33.559
News to me.

41:33.625 --> 41:36.227
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

41:39.430 --> 41:42.233
You think there's
any connection at all
to your mother's case?

41:42.300 --> 41:43.835
Jesus, Grace, I don't know.

41:43.902 --> 41:45.904
But if his place
was gutted by a fire,

41:45.971 --> 41:47.673
where did he keep
the murder book? Why?

41:47.739 --> 41:49.407
All good questions.

41:49.474 --> 41:50.709
- Shit.
- What?

41:50.776 --> 41:53.111
Something I forgot to do.

42:01.820 --> 42:04.122
Hey, Meg,
have you seen Captain Lewis?

42:04.189 --> 42:06.124
Um... not in today.

42:06.191 --> 42:07.325
Or the rest of the week.

42:07.392 --> 42:09.094
Oh, wow.
Under the weather?

42:09.160 --> 42:12.097
No. Taking some
personal time, she said.

42:12.163 --> 42:13.799
Huh.

42:30.515 --> 42:34.085
- Terry.
- Santi.

42:38.023 --> 42:40.291
So you followed my advice.

42:40.358 --> 42:43.094
Don't I always?
Thank you.

42:43.161 --> 42:45.797
- Scott Anderson.
- Mm-hmm.

42:45.864 --> 42:46.865
Quite the writer.

42:46.932 --> 42:49.300
Yeah, it turned out all right.

42:51.036 --> 42:54.806
I know you got
your eyes on RHD.

42:54.873 --> 42:57.976
Yeah, but
the politics involved?

42:58.043 --> 43:00.812
You know better than anyone.
It's a crapshoot.

43:00.879 --> 43:03.481
Everything's got
to break the right way.

43:03.548 --> 43:07.152
Still, this looks
good for you, Santiago.

43:09.888 --> 43:11.356
What are you trying
to tell me, Terry?

43:13.558 --> 43:15.994
Don't unravel the sweater.

43:16.061 --> 43:20.498
No intention.
I'll let Bosch deal
with his own shit.

43:20.565 --> 43:23.334
I don't need
to be his conscience.

43:23.401 --> 43:26.337
Couldn't prove it anyway.

43:26.404 --> 43:28.940
- There's that.
- Yep.

43:30.575 --> 43:32.210
Always that.

44:53.691 --> 44:54.893
Xavi!

45:04.635 --> 45:07.605
Problem?
Why we stopping?

45:07.672 --> 45:09.240
The genny
feel offline to you?

45:09.307 --> 45:11.242
- No.
- I want to check it out.

45:11.309 --> 45:13.111
- Take the wheel?
- Sure.

45:20.251 --> 45:24.222
God damn it.
Hit the killswitch!

45:24.289 --> 45:25.791
Everything okay?

45:27.525 --> 45:29.060
Yeah.

45:33.398 --> 45:34.833
A-okay.

45:40.405 --> 45:42.007
Knock knock.

45:42.073 --> 45:43.975
Jimmy.

45:44.042 --> 45:45.811
How they treating you?

45:45.877 --> 45:47.813
Can't complain.

45:47.879 --> 45:49.647
Heard you were
entertaining visitors.

45:49.714 --> 45:50.816
Thought I'd drop by.

45:50.882 --> 45:52.150
I'm glad you did.

45:52.217 --> 45:55.520
Congratulations
on the Gunn case, man.

45:55.586 --> 45:57.823
Oh, thanks.

45:57.889 --> 45:59.757
I'm sure Harry's
kept you up to speed.

45:59.825 --> 46:02.593
He hasn't been by today,
not yet.

46:02.660 --> 46:04.996
Hmm.

46:05.063 --> 46:06.664
I brought you something.

46:06.731 --> 46:09.167
Thought you might
be interested.

46:09.234 --> 46:11.169
Audio from Bosch's interview
with Rudy Tafero.

46:11.236 --> 46:15.006
- He give it up?
- Yeah, soup to nuts.

46:15.073 --> 46:17.308
We arrested Holland
last night.

46:17.375 --> 46:20.511
Give it a listen
when you feel up to it.

46:20.578 --> 46:23.014
Thanks. I will.
