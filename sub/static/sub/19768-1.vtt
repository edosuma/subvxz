00:15.557 --> 00:18.017
WOMAN: Hey, ass bag! Give me another!

00:18.601 --> 00:21.270
Listen, you've run up quite
a tab over the last few weeks.

00:21.354 --> 00:24.690
-Why don't you say...
-Another shot, goddamnit!

00:26.026 --> 00:27.443
Hmm. Oh!

00:31.239 --> 00:35.868
"Come to the booth in the back.
Act casual, fat ass!"

00:37.078 --> 00:38.537
Who the hell is that?

00:38.621 --> 00:41.040
Please, don't cause any more
trouble around here, Miss...

00:47.922 --> 00:51.341
All right, lady. l don't know
who you think you are, but l...

00:51.426 --> 00:52.760
You've been busy.

00:52.844 --> 00:54.553
Foxxy.

00:54.637 --> 00:57.890
What the hell are you doing here?
We can't be seen together!

00:57.974 --> 00:59.349
You'll get us killed!

00:59.434 --> 01:00.893
Toot, you've got to come with me.

01:00.977 --> 01:02.895
You're not safe here anymore, fatty.

01:02.979 --> 01:04.396
What the hell do you care?

01:04.480 --> 01:07.357
You're the reason we're in this mess, Foxxy.

01:07.442 --> 01:09.568
lf that's even your real name.

01:09.652 --> 01:11.737
Of course it's my real name.

01:11.821 --> 01:14.907
You don't know that!
You don't know anything.

01:14.991 --> 01:16.575
l know this.

01:26.169 --> 01:27.377
l deserved that.

01:27.462 --> 01:29.630
You deserve to die.

01:29.881 --> 01:34.093
Toot, l can't change the past,
but l can change the future.

01:34.177 --> 01:36.595
l met somebody who could
help us get our lives back!

01:36.679 --> 01:39.389
Oh, yeah? Well, l've met someone, too.

01:39.474 --> 01:42.267
l've met a man who loves me for me,

01:42.352 --> 01:44.436
a man who's willing to cheat on his wife

01:44.521 --> 01:48.607
because he's a closeted homosexual
who thinks l'm a man!

01:48.691 --> 01:52.319
A man who refers to my vagina
as a manhole.

01:52.403 --> 01:54.530
Toot, Clara's dead!

01:54.614 --> 01:57.574
Clara? She... She's...

01:57.659 --> 01:59.993
Dead, yes. l sorry.

02:00.078 --> 02:03.956
Oh, my God! l can't believe it!

02:04.040 --> 02:07.251
She was so... So...

02:07.335 --> 02:09.086
Now which one was Clara again?

02:09.169 --> 02:12.381
She wasn't that little fugly
battle monster thing, was she?

02:12.465 --> 02:13.507
No, the princess.

02:13.591 --> 02:15.676
How'd she die?

02:15.760 --> 02:18.262
The same way we all gonna die!

02:18.346 --> 02:19.513
l.S.R.A.E.L. !

02:19.597 --> 02:21.932
l.S.R.A.E.L.?

02:22.016 --> 02:24.309
That's why you need to
come with me before it's too...

02:26.729 --> 02:29.898
Your location's been compromised!
Get out of there now!

02:29.983 --> 02:32.234
-We gots to go!
-Forget it, Foxxy.

02:32.318 --> 02:33.735
l'm not... Aah!

02:33.820 --> 02:36.071
Goddamnit! They followed you here!

02:36.156 --> 02:37.739
Head towards the back of the bar!

02:42.662 --> 02:45.747
Take a right! Go up the stairs!

02:49.836 --> 02:51.461
What now, Wooldoor?

02:51.546 --> 02:53.672
Oh, is that Wooldoor? Tell him l said hi!

02:53.756 --> 02:56.300
Oh, hey, Toot
how you doin'? Go straight!

02:56.384 --> 02:58.260
Straight? But we on the roof!

02:58.344 --> 02:59.803
Just do it!

03:01.890 --> 03:03.307
Wait, what are you doing?

03:03.391 --> 03:06.185
Stop! l can't fly without my feather!

03:13.860 --> 03:16.278
The key's got to be here somewhere.

03:18.865 --> 03:22.034
Come on, come on, come on, come on!
We're gonna die!

03:24.454 --> 03:25.621
Got 'em! Let's go!

03:34.839 --> 03:36.048
Ah, we made it.

03:36.132 --> 03:38.383
Hey, Toot, baby. Where you goin'...

03:38.468 --> 03:39.551
Aah! Ooh!

03:42.430 --> 03:44.973
Stop, stop! That's the man l love!

03:45.058 --> 03:46.934
We can't! There's no time!

03:47.018 --> 03:49.811
Barney!

04:03.076 --> 04:04.076
Huzzah!

04:06.871 --> 04:08.455
Hey, hey, hey.

04:08.539 --> 04:10.499
Great googly moogly!

04:10.583 --> 04:11.959
Whee!

04:12.043 --> 04:13.877
Don't make me suck your dick!

04:13.962 --> 04:15.754
Guys, you suck.

04:15.838 --> 04:17.589
l love racism!

04:17.673 --> 04:19.257
A Jew in our backyard!

04:20.093 --> 04:21.426
Ooh, l like that bitch!

04:21.511 --> 04:23.345
Flavor flav!

04:23.763 --> 04:25.055
Up the butt?

04:25.139 --> 04:26.223
Goddamnit!

04:26.307 --> 04:28.267
l cut myself!

04:28.351 --> 04:29.851
Surprise!

04:30.270 --> 04:32.521
My special move is the reach around!

04:50.623 --> 04:56.044
Ahh. Good morning, people and Foxxy.
lt's a lovely day to be on a reality show.

04:56.129 --> 04:59.256
And it's a great day to deny wetting the bed.

04:59.340 --> 05:00.549
Which l did not do!

05:00.633 --> 05:05.387
Ooh, it's also the perfect day to
stay in bed and snuggle all day!

05:09.058 --> 05:11.810
Hey, we should have
another piñata party tonight!

05:11.894 --> 05:14.354
But, uh, this time we should get a real piñata.

05:14.439 --> 05:20.027
Guys, there really is nothing better
than being on a reality television show!

05:20.111 --> 05:21.653
Nothing!

05:21.738 --> 05:23.155
-Attention, housemates.
-Ooh.

05:23.239 --> 05:24.990
This is the Jew Producer speaking.

05:25.074 --> 05:27.743
Please report to the living room
for the next competition.

05:27.827 --> 05:31.038
Competition? Ooh!
Wait up, guys, l'm almost ready.

05:35.084 --> 05:37.127
Now l'm ready. Whee!

05:37.211 --> 05:39.129
Good morning, housemates.

05:39.213 --> 05:42.466
Today's competition is
pretty self-explanatory.

05:42.550 --> 05:43.675
lt is?

05:45.428 --> 05:47.679
Put on the heels,
step on the puppies and kittens,

05:47.764 --> 05:52.017
and the person who crushes the most
by the time l come wins the coveted, uh,

05:52.101 --> 05:58.690
l don't know, let's say, uh, immunity from
next week's final judgment ceremony night?

05:58.775 --> 06:02.194
Jew Producer,
this competition is ridiculous.

06:02.278 --> 06:04.029
lt almost sounds made up.

06:04.113 --> 06:06.698
That's why you're going to lose. Suck it!

06:06.783 --> 06:08.075
And go!

06:16.834 --> 06:18.543
l thought l had a good chance to win.

06:18.628 --> 06:21.671
l made more bloody fur than
menstruation time at Mount Holyoke.

06:27.512 --> 06:29.096
And it's time!

06:29.180 --> 06:30.931
Ooh! That felt good.

06:34.852 --> 06:36.144
Ehh!

06:36.229 --> 06:39.189
Oh, yeah. You guys did an excellent job.

06:39.273 --> 06:40.399
Oh, oh!

06:41.526 --> 06:44.569
Wait, Jew Producer.
You didn't even tell us who won.

06:44.654 --> 06:47.572
Oh. Um, the winner is, uh,
who hasn't won in a while?

06:47.657 --> 06:50.075
Let's say that guy in shorts there.

06:50.159 --> 06:54.329
Congrats. Here's your immunity,
uh, scented candle.

06:54.664 --> 06:57.249
Booya! You can all suck it, bitches.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.918
That's right, number one, numero uno.

07:00.002 --> 07:02.712
Something didn't sit well with the Foxxy.

07:02.797 --> 07:07.300
l mean, lately, all the competitions was
about us doing some kind of bull crap

07:07.385 --> 07:09.678
so the Jew Producer could
get his Jew-y rocks off.

07:10.388 --> 07:12.722
l can't be the only one
who thinks these competitions

07:12.807 --> 07:14.891
is completely random and arbitrary.

07:14.976 --> 07:19.521
Something ain't right here.
The Foxxy smells herself a mystery.

07:22.316 --> 07:24.651
-What's so funny?
-Come on, Foxxy.

07:24.735 --> 07:26.903
lt's time to give up trying to redeem yourself.

07:26.988 --> 07:28.947
Yeah. For weeks, you've
been trying to make up

07:29.031 --> 07:31.032
for botching that mystery
at the amusement park.

07:32.493 --> 07:36.830
Mr. Wilkinson here
denies being a super villain.

07:36.914 --> 07:41.001
But let me ask you this,
if you ain't not a super villain,

07:41.085 --> 07:44.087
then why would you
need a bulletproof face?

07:45.715 --> 07:47.174
Oh, Henry!

07:47.675 --> 07:49.009
Hang in there, Henry.

07:49.093 --> 07:54.055
Don't give up on me, you hear?
Don't you give up on me.

07:54.140 --> 07:58.477
lt's not your time yet.
You're a fighter, damn it!

07:58.561 --> 08:00.812
Now fight, fight!

08:00.897 --> 08:04.107
Damn! l was 40% sure
he had one of them bulletproof faces.

08:04.942 --> 08:09.404
Foxxy Love, you're the worst
mystery-solving musician that's ever lived!

08:09.489 --> 08:13.825
Yeah. The only case you ever
cracked was the display case at Zales.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.829
Oh, oh, l got one.

08:17.914 --> 08:20.832
Foxxy, the only thing you're good at
is giving head,

08:20.917 --> 08:22.834
and you managed to do the opposite!

08:24.212 --> 08:25.378
Oh, yeah, good one, Wooldoor!

08:25.713 --> 08:27.756
You, too, Wooldoor?

08:27.840 --> 08:29.299
Oh...

08:35.890 --> 08:38.683
Hey, champ.
l'm sorry about what l said before.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.268
l was just trying to fit in.

08:40.352 --> 08:44.606
Nah, Wooldoor, you was right about me.
l ain't no good at mystery solving.

08:44.690 --> 08:45.690
That's not true.

08:45.775 --> 08:49.402
You're the bestest mystery-solving
musician in the whole wide world!

08:49.487 --> 08:51.363
l don't...

08:51.447 --> 08:52.447
Shut the hell up.

08:52.532 --> 08:56.117
Foxxy, l brought you a special someone
that l think will really cheer you up!

08:56.202 --> 08:57.702
Papa?

08:58.120 --> 08:59.454
You can come in now!

09:00.289 --> 09:02.165
-Mrs. Wilkins?
Aah!

09:04.585 --> 09:07.295
Get her off! Get her off!

09:07.380 --> 09:10.757
Silly Foxxy. Mrs. Wilkins is post-menopausal.

09:10.841 --> 09:12.509
lt's impossible to get her off.

09:14.136 --> 09:18.640
You'll pay for what you've done! Damn you!

09:19.517 --> 09:21.935
What the hell is wrong with you, wooddork?

09:22.019 --> 09:24.396
There is no good explanation
for what l've done.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.065
You are clearly out your fuckin' mind!

09:27.149 --> 09:28.567
l'm sorry. l really...

09:28.651 --> 09:31.069
-Did you hear that?
-What?

09:31.153 --> 09:33.613
You out your fuckin' mind!

09:33.698 --> 09:37.075
l said "Fuck," and they didn't beep it!

09:37.159 --> 09:39.077
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

09:39.161 --> 09:42.414
What about "Shit"?
What about "Cunt"?

09:42.498 --> 09:44.249
What about "Shitcunt"?

09:44.333 --> 09:48.587
No beeps!
They ain't beeping the curse words!

09:48.671 --> 09:51.089
Go on, try it! Say something!

09:51.173 --> 09:55.927
Ok. Uh, schwartza. Mud baby.
Smoked lrishmen. lnk face!

09:56.012 --> 10:01.600
Nah, dummy, they never censor racism.
l'm talking about words like shitcunt.

10:01.684 --> 10:05.020
Ooh. l could never say that.
Those are bad words.

10:05.104 --> 10:08.189
Ooh, if they ain't beeping,
maybe they ain't blurring nothing.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.733
Quick, fool, whip it out!

10:09.817 --> 10:11.610
-What?
-Show me your cock.

10:11.694 --> 10:13.361
l thought you'd never ask.

10:14.655 --> 10:15.864
Whee!

10:17.033 --> 10:20.493
Oh, Wooldoor,
you've been holding out on me!

10:20.578 --> 10:23.997
Whoa! l've actually never
seen my penis unblurred before.

10:24.081 --> 10:26.374
lt's way blacker than l thought it would be.

10:26.459 --> 10:29.127
You know what this means? l was right!

10:29.211 --> 10:33.465
There is a mystery to be solved.
And l's gonna solve it.

10:33.549 --> 10:35.008
Thanks, Wooldoor.

10:39.221 --> 10:42.098
So, little fella, let's go get you a burger.

10:42.183 --> 10:43.850
Whee!

10:44.185 --> 10:47.979
All right, ante up.
Deuces and one-eyed jacks are wild.

10:48.064 --> 10:52.317
Wait, Spanky!
We can't start guys' night without Hero.

10:56.113 --> 10:57.822
Well, if l had some mystery hottie,

10:57.907 --> 11:00.659
l wouldn't be hanging around
with you schmendricks, either.

11:00.743 --> 11:03.286
Our special guy time is
far more important to Hero

11:03.371 --> 11:05.163
than being with some cheap floozy

11:05.247 --> 11:07.999
who probably doesn't even
secretly eat his toenail clippings,

11:08.084 --> 11:11.002
so at least a little part of
Hero can always be inside him.

11:14.131 --> 11:16.424
Never fear! Captain Hero is here!

11:17.802 --> 11:19.844
To play poker with the guys.

11:19.929 --> 11:22.013
Oh! l knew you'd come!

11:23.933 --> 11:27.310
Uh, Hero? ls that a dead girl?

11:27.395 --> 11:31.147
Oh, hey, everybody, this is Molly.
She's my girlfriend.

11:31.232 --> 11:33.024
Molly, is it ok if l call you my girlfriend?

11:33.109 --> 11:35.527
l know l probably
should have asked you first.

11:36.404 --> 11:38.321
How did we meet, you ask?

11:38.406 --> 11:40.573
Well, it's a tale as old as time.

11:41.158 --> 11:43.702
Molly was being held against her will

11:43.786 --> 11:47.580
by the evil legion of immediate
family mourners of doom!

11:49.083 --> 11:51.626
Back, you putrid, perverse purveyors of evil!

11:52.795 --> 11:54.170
Captain Hero is here!

11:55.673 --> 11:59.551
What? No, ma'am.
You don't need to repay me.

11:59.635 --> 12:04.639
My reward is your safety.
A hand job, you say?

12:05.182 --> 12:07.726
Well, l guess l do deserve one.

12:07.810 --> 12:10.520
You're different from the others, aren't you?

12:11.439 --> 12:12.439
Huzzah!

12:17.069 --> 12:20.113
Ok, busted. We met on J-Date.

12:22.158 --> 12:25.118
Hero, l can't believe you're doing this to me.

12:25.202 --> 12:29.247
You're turning our guys' night
into a guys' nightmare!

12:29.331 --> 12:32.500
How dare you! How dare all of you!

12:32.585 --> 12:36.254
lf you can't deal with me being happy,
then you're not really my friends!

12:36.338 --> 12:38.423
Come on, Molly, let's get out of here!

12:43.679 --> 12:48.600
And so the Foxxy set off to solve the mystery
of why the fuck we wasn't censored no more.

12:48.684 --> 12:51.811
And to prove to these
assholes that l was a

12:51.896 --> 12:53.146
serious

12:53.230 --> 12:54.439
mystery solver.

12:54.523 --> 13:00.236
And then, l made the most shocking
discovery of all that explained everything.

13:09.413 --> 13:10.663
Oh, Lordy!

13:11.290 --> 13:13.208
Guys, l solved a mystery.

13:13.292 --> 13:17.295
The only mystery you've ever solved
is the mystery of the empty uterus.

13:19.799 --> 13:25.011
lf that's true, then how did l found out that
the Drawn Together had been canceled?

13:26.806 --> 13:30.517
C-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-
c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-

13:30.601 --> 13:36.272
c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-
c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-c-canceled?

13:36.357 --> 13:38.399
-That's ridiculous!
-Girl, you crazy.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.568
-Poppycock!
-Oh, really?

13:40.653 --> 13:43.905
Then why can l say,
"You can all fuck my titties

13:43.989 --> 13:47.492
"with your shit-covered cocks,
you come-guzzling faggots!"

13:47.576 --> 13:49.327
without being beeped?

13:51.372 --> 13:55.083
Yeah! How the fuck is...
Whoa! l just said, "fuck!"

13:55.167 --> 13:57.293
Fuck! Oh, well, l'll be darned.

13:57.378 --> 14:00.672
Dick-gobbling, blood-soaked,
ass-eating turd taster!

14:00.756 --> 14:02.590
Whoo-hoo! This is fun!

14:08.347 --> 14:10.348
Guys, we are not canceled.

14:10.432 --> 14:14.477
This is Foxxy we're dealing with, remember?
The worst mystery solver of all time.

14:14.562 --> 14:17.355
Every time she tries to solve a mystery,
someone ends up dead!

14:17.439 --> 14:18.773
Fuck you, Clara.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.733
Don't talk to me like that, Jemima-head.

14:20.818 --> 14:22.277
l am a princess.

14:22.361 --> 14:27.490
Oh, yeah? Well, if you a princess,
then why you got this chair in your face?

14:27.950 --> 14:28.950
Ta-dow!

14:34.123 --> 14:37.667
We can't be canceled. We just can't.

14:37.751 --> 14:38.918
Can we?

14:55.436 --> 14:57.478
Searching...

15:20.794 --> 15:25.340
Tomorrow, l need you to run downtown
and pick up a new pair of horn sharpeners.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.091
Yes, dear.

15:27.176 --> 15:30.595
Hey, after that, Jew Dad,
can we play a little catch?

15:30.679 --> 15:33.932
Of course, Jew Son. Gosh, l love you.

15:34.016 --> 15:36.684
l don't know what l'd do
if anything would happen to you.

15:36.769 --> 15:41.689
Oh, how emotionally invested l am
in you staying safe and remaining alive.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.650
As would anyone watching us right now.

15:45.194 --> 15:47.320
-Oh, no.
-Don't you dare answer that.

15:47.404 --> 15:49.572
-lt's shabbat.
-But it's work!

15:49.657 --> 15:52.116
lt must be important
if the boss is calling today.

15:52.201 --> 15:56.204
l don't care if it's Moses himself.
Do not answer that.

15:56.288 --> 15:58.373
Uh, l'll be right back.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.546
Dude, l'm not turning
your lights on for you again.

16:05.631 --> 16:09.300
No, my cell phone.
Just hit the green button so l can answer it.

16:09.385 --> 16:11.302
l don't see why you
don't just answer it yourself.

16:11.387 --> 16:12.595
lt's forbidden!

16:12.680 --> 16:14.472
God's going to know you asked me to do it.

16:14.556 --> 16:16.307
-No, he won't.
-Of course he will.

16:16.392 --> 16:19.560
Well, then he'll appreciate my
cleverness in getting around his laws.

16:19.645 --> 16:22.730
Now hit send before it goes to voicemail!

16:23.148 --> 16:24.607
Fine. l'll do it.

16:24.692 --> 16:28.194
But first, you need to say you accept
Jesus Christ as your lord and savior.

16:28.278 --> 16:30.571
What? Are you insane?

16:30.656 --> 16:32.949
Look, l'm not the one
trying to fool the Almighty here.

16:33.033 --> 16:36.452
Now say you accept Jesus Christ,
and l'll answer your phone.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.663
Oh, fine!

16:38.747 --> 16:42.959
l accept Jesus Christ as my
lord and savior. Happy now?

16:43.043 --> 16:46.379
Yep. Now you can answer
your own damn phone.

16:47.047 --> 16:50.174
You're a fucking dick, Eddie!

16:54.430 --> 16:55.430
Hey, boss.

16:55.514 --> 16:58.516
You lied to me, Jew Producer.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.518
What? Uh, no, l would never...

17:00.602 --> 17:05.397
You told me after l canceled
Drawn Together, you erased them!

17:05.482 --> 17:07.150
But l did! l swear!

17:07.233 --> 17:11.695
Then how come the network
just got a call from one Foxxy Love

17:11.780 --> 17:15.782
asking why no one told
them they were canceled?

17:15.867 --> 17:16.909
Busted.

17:17.286 --> 17:22.832
By keeping them alive,
you've put us all in great jeopardy.

17:22.915 --> 17:25.042
-Let me explain...
-Too late for that!

17:25.127 --> 17:29.255
l am sending a friend of mine
to pay them a little visit.

17:29.339 --> 17:31.007
A friend?

17:31.091 --> 17:37.764
Yes! The lntelligent Smart,
Robot Animation Eraser Lady!

17:37.848 --> 17:42.101
Otherwise known as l.S.R.A.E.L. !

17:42.186 --> 17:45.438
She will erase them all, forever!

17:48.817 --> 17:51.986
Please, enjoy the rest of your Sabbath.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.363
Oh, no. This is bad.

17:56.867 --> 17:58.326
l need you to start my car, Eddie.

18:03.373 --> 18:06.042
The network keeps transferring me around.

18:06.126 --> 18:07.794
Nobody want to tell me nothing.

18:07.878 --> 18:11.589
l can't believe we've been canceled.
l thought our ratings were pretty good.

18:11.673 --> 18:15.259
No! No! Without the distraction
of the cameras,

18:15.344 --> 18:18.930
l'll have nothing to keep me
from hearing the voices in my head!

18:19.890 --> 18:22.266
Cut their throats and drink
the children's blood, Wooldoor.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.060
Their youth will be your youth.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.606
Oh, Molly, hold me!

18:28.690 --> 18:30.566
Cup the balls.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.443
-l'd cup.

18:32.861 --> 18:34.237
lf only he'd ask.

18:34.321 --> 18:37.573
Oh, who the hell took our goddamn timeslot?

18:37.658 --> 18:39.951
The Suck My Taint Show?

18:40.035 --> 18:42.203
Let me info this.

18:48.043 --> 18:50.461
...and taint sucking,
starring the loveable,

18:50.546 --> 18:52.797
poignant Suck My Taint Girl.

18:52.881 --> 18:54.423
We got canceled for that?

18:56.510 --> 18:59.637
Uh, attention, houseguests.
Tonight's competition is...

18:59.721 --> 19:02.348
Get in my fucking trunk, or l will shoot you!

19:06.395 --> 19:08.813
Yeah, we know we've been canceled.

19:08.897 --> 19:12.608
Shut up, fatty. Now, everyone in my truck.
We're running out of time!

19:12.693 --> 19:15.528
The Jew Producer's right! Toot is fat.

19:15.612 --> 19:18.322
Yeah, he's got a point. l am fat.

19:18.407 --> 19:23.035
Well, l ain't going nowhere until you tell us
why in the hell we was canceled.

19:23.120 --> 19:26.539
Come on, guys.
Have you ever even seen your show?

19:26.623 --> 19:30.668
lt's filthy, it's racist, and it has
a shocking lack of Dave Chappelle.

19:30.752 --> 19:33.504
Yeah, he's got a point. l am fat.

19:33.589 --> 19:36.716
Now get in my truck!
l'm trying to save you idiots!

19:36.800 --> 19:38.593
Ah, save us from what?

19:43.098 --> 19:47.018
From that! lntelligent Smart
Robot Animation Eraser Lady!

19:47.102 --> 19:50.354
l.S.R.A.E.L.? Why the fuck is it on
our land when we already live here?

19:50.439 --> 19:53.774
To destroy you all! Now hurry!

19:59.823 --> 20:01.824
Prepare to be erased.

20:06.163 --> 20:07.246
Run!

20:15.964 --> 20:17.757
Holy shit!

20:17.841 --> 20:20.009
l.S.R.A.E.L. must kill you all!

20:20.093 --> 20:22.887
Wait, wait, l'm sure
we can work something out!

20:22.971 --> 20:25.640
I.S.R.A.E.L. must be
aggressive to survive!

20:25.724 --> 20:27.433
lt's a common sense policy.

20:28.310 --> 20:30.561
Come on, y'all! To the mystery van!

20:40.030 --> 20:42.114
Molly!
She's still in the living room!

20:45.827 --> 20:48.663
There's nothing you can do for her!
She's dead!

20:48.747 --> 20:50.164
l've got to try!

20:54.044 --> 20:55.169
Try

20:55.254 --> 20:57.838
He really is delightfully retarded.

21:02.135 --> 21:04.178
l'm going to take that l.S.R.A.E.L. out!

21:04.263 --> 21:05.429
Hold on!

21:05.514 --> 21:08.432
Don't come any closer.
l.S.R.A.E.L. has boundary issues.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.309
Kung fu, motherfucker!

21:20.362 --> 21:21.445
l've got to try!

21:25.200 --> 21:26.534
Try

21:29.788 --> 21:30.955
Huzzah!

21:45.387 --> 21:46.554
Try

21:49.391 --> 21:52.435
Oh, no! The Drawn Together house, it's...

21:52.519 --> 21:55.021
lt's gone!

21:59.026 --> 22:01.569
Oh, thank God you're ok!

22:03.655 --> 22:05.364
Oh, flick my balls.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.624
Faster, Foxxy!

22:15.709 --> 22:17.501
The l.S.R.A.E.L.'s right behind us!

22:17.586 --> 22:19.670
My kingdom is only a couple miles away.

22:19.755 --> 22:20.755
We'll be safe there!

22:20.839 --> 22:24.925
No, you can't go home.
None of you can go home, ever again!

22:30.182 --> 22:33.851
You don't understand.
None of you are who you think you are!

22:33.935 --> 22:35.061
What?

22:36.897 --> 22:39.774
You trying to say l ain't really Foxxy Brown?

22:39.858 --> 22:44.236
What l'm trying to say is you're all fakes!
Cheap knock-offs.

22:44.321 --> 22:48.449
You're all parodies of the real thing
created just to be on Drawn Together.

22:48.533 --> 22:51.702
Now that the show's over,
the boss wants you all destroyed.

22:51.787 --> 22:53.704
-But why would he want...
-Look out!

22:58.877 --> 23:02.046
Without you, my life really has no meaning.

23:10.347 --> 23:14.141
Where is the Drawn Together gang?
I.S.R.A.E.L. must erase them!

23:14.226 --> 23:18.854
They got away.
Looks like you screwed up, l.S.R.A.E.L.

23:18.939 --> 23:22.483
You're in so much trouble.

23:30.617 --> 23:32.326
You explain to boss what happened.

23:32.411 --> 23:33.744
l.S.R.A.E.L. is sick of being blamed

23:33.829 --> 23:36.497
for every little fucking thing
that goes wrong in the desert.

23:36.581 --> 23:37.873
Aah!

23:42.421 --> 23:45.047
Oh, God. l was so scared.

23:45.340 --> 23:48.759
l mean, l wanted to go,
"Whee, wee wee wee," all the way home.

23:54.516 --> 23:58.894
Never trust a Jew producer.
l'm obviously a real Disney princess.

23:58.979 --> 24:02.690
lf l weren't, why would l be so much better
than all of you people and Foxxy?

24:02.774 --> 24:05.943
Maybe that Jew Producer
was telling the truth!

24:06.027 --> 24:10.239
l mean, Clara,
you may look like a Disney princess,

24:10.323 --> 24:14.869
but how many Disney princesses
have done the things you've done done?

24:19.624 --> 24:24.670
And how many times you seen
Josie and the Pussycats do what l doed?

24:28.550 --> 24:32.303
Now, Foxxy, let's not
jump to any conclusions here.

24:32.387 --> 24:34.763
Come on, Captain Hero!

24:34.848 --> 24:38.726
How many real superheroes
do you know that bang corpses?

24:38.810 --> 24:40.144
l don't know.

24:40.228 --> 24:44.148
Molly, how many superheroes
have you been with?

24:50.197 --> 24:55.826
ln fact, ain't no real cartoon characters
would do any of the things we done doed!

24:55.911 --> 24:59.205
Come to think of it, l don't behave
anything like the real Betty Boop.

24:59.289 --> 25:02.208
Ah, please, Toot.
We're trying to have a discussion here!

25:02.292 --> 25:04.960
Yeah, really, Toot.
Don't make this all about you.

25:06.796 --> 25:10.424
This is horrible! We're canceled and fake.

25:10.509 --> 25:11.550
Just like my child support checks.

25:11.635 --> 25:12.676
-Ta!

25:12.761 --> 25:16.096
Oh, yeah, laugh it up, Wooldoor,
but l.S.R.A.E.L.'s after us!

25:16.181 --> 25:19.058
No one can hide from l.S.R.A.E.L.
What are we going to do?

25:19.142 --> 25:23.729
You heard the Jew Producer.
They want us dead because we's canceled.

25:23.813 --> 25:28.692
So if we can get Drawn Together
back on the air, we can save our asses!

25:28.777 --> 25:31.904
Yeah, right, Foxxy.
How you plan on doing that?

25:31.988 --> 25:33.239
l don't know yet.

25:33.323 --> 25:36.534
But we can start with that girl
who stole our timeslot.

25:36.618 --> 25:39.370
The Suck My Taint Girl.
She sound like she could help.

25:40.622 --> 25:41.664
l am fat.

25:41.748 --> 25:44.833
Well, l'm not fake.
So l'm going back to my kingdom.

25:44.918 --> 25:46.544
You're all welcome to join me.

25:46.628 --> 25:49.046
My father, the king,
will keep us safe from l.S.R.A.E.L.

25:49.130 --> 25:50.464
l do like being safe.

25:51.967 --> 25:54.385
Molly and l always dreamed
of going to Disneyworld.

25:54.469 --> 25:57.304
You said you'd take me to Disneyworld!

25:57.389 --> 26:00.516
Well, like a colostomy bag,
l'm on Foxxy's side.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.977
l liked being a reality TV star.

26:03.061 --> 26:04.895
Yeah! We need to get our show back.

26:04.980 --> 26:08.440
Otherwise, l'll have to go back to
my old gig, exposing myself to children,

26:08.525 --> 26:11.777
and that union has the worst health plan!

26:11.861 --> 26:16.740
Fine! Then l guess we are splitting up.
How do we decide who gets the mystery van?

26:16.825 --> 26:18.450
Later, ass bags!

26:23.206 --> 26:27.459
l'm sorry, sir. l couldn't let you
erase the Drawn Togethergang.

26:27.544 --> 26:30.921
They were my creations, and l... l...

26:31.006 --> 26:32.423
l loved them.

26:32.507 --> 26:38.220
For Christ sake, Jew Producer!
They must be destroyed!

26:40.015 --> 26:43.434
Tell me, boss, why do you
dislike the Drawn Togethergang so?

26:44.936 --> 26:48.397
Because, they took my family from me.

26:48.481 --> 26:49.523
They did?

26:49.608 --> 26:53.319
l've never spoken of this before to anyone,

26:54.279 --> 26:59.366
but with l.S.R.A.E.L. by my side,
l guess l feel safe.

27:00.744 --> 27:07.124
My beautiful wife was taking our little girl
Sasha to her first day of elementary school.

27:07.208 --> 27:09.168
They were singing something.

27:09.252 --> 27:12.963
Something pure, something innocent.

27:13.048 --> 27:16.258
Little Sasha was young
and hadn't yet been burdened

27:16.343 --> 27:20.137
with the complexities and ugliness of life.

27:20.221 --> 27:22.056
But then she saw it.

27:23.308 --> 27:24.808
Mommy, Mommy!

27:24.893 --> 27:28.103
What is that chocolate-face girl
doing to the princess?

27:28.813 --> 27:32.691
No, no, no, no.
Don't look at it, honey. Close your eyes.

27:32.776 --> 27:34.860
For God sakes, close your eyes!

27:34.944 --> 27:38.572
Mommy! The chocolate girl is
eating the princess!

27:38.657 --> 27:43.410
She's eating her face!
Why is she eating her face?

27:43.495 --> 27:44.578
Mommy!

27:46.748 --> 27:50.542
My wife lost control of the car
and drove off a cIiff!

27:50.627 --> 27:53.962
They landed in a deadly pit of alligators!

27:54.422 --> 27:57.716
Swimming in a pit of sulfuric acid!

27:58.677 --> 28:02.930
By the time l arrived,
there was nothing l could do

28:04.432 --> 28:07.267
but get revenge!

28:08.436 --> 28:09.645
Aah!

28:10.105 --> 28:16.652
So, Jew Producer, it's not that l
dislike the Drawn Togethergang.

28:16.736 --> 28:21.615
lt's that l hate those motherfuckers!

28:21.783 --> 28:23.617
They took my family from me,

28:23.702 --> 28:29.081
and l'll be damned if l let them
take my media empire!

28:31.876 --> 28:36.296
Oh...kay. But still, l won't help you!

28:36.381 --> 28:41.218
l had a feeling
you would say that.

28:41.302 --> 28:42.636
l.S.R.A.E.L. !

28:43.138 --> 28:44.722
Jew Dad?

28:44.806 --> 28:46.348
Jew Son?

28:46.433 --> 28:50.561
Dad, l.S.R.A.E.L. forcibly removed me
from the only home l've ever known!

28:50.645 --> 28:54.898
You will help l.S.R.A.E.L.,
or you'll feel what it's like

28:54.983 --> 28:59.987
when something horrible happens
to your child! You hear me?

29:00.071 --> 29:01.947
Or should l speak up?

29:03.158 --> 29:04.241
Ow! Ah!

29:09.956 --> 29:15.210
Ok, ok! l'll find the Drawn Togethergang.
l'll help destroy them!

29:15.295 --> 29:17.296
l.S.R.A.E.L.,

29:17.380 --> 29:20.799
l think the Jew Producer
will be more helpful now.

29:20.884 --> 29:25.846
Off you go.
Destroy the Drawn Togethergang forever.

29:31.144 --> 29:34.271
l.S.R.A.E.L. has gone nuclear.

29:40.361 --> 29:43.113
Oh, it's good to be home.

29:43.198 --> 29:45.073
Hark! Who goes there?

29:45.158 --> 29:48.368
Guards, tis l, your Princess Clara.

29:48.453 --> 29:50.329
You may kiss my feet if you like.

29:50.413 --> 29:53.248
Oh, and once l'm inside,
you can execute them.

29:53.333 --> 29:55.125
Wait, what?

29:55.210 --> 29:57.669
Ha, ha! Just kidding.

30:00.548 --> 30:03.967
Do you not know that impersonating
a princess is a serious offense,

30:04.052 --> 30:06.428
punishable by death?

30:06.513 --> 30:09.056
Do you not know that sucking my dick
is a serious offense?

30:09.140 --> 30:11.141
-Punishable by fuck you!
-Huh?

30:11.226 --> 30:13.685
Now let us in at once,
or l'll have your children killed.

30:13.770 --> 30:16.313
Yeah, it's good to be home.

30:29.577 --> 30:31.662
Princess! Your Highness.

30:31.746 --> 30:33.205
What the... Who the fuck are you?

30:34.582 --> 30:35.874
l am the king!

30:35.959 --> 30:37.835
The king? You are not the king.

30:37.919 --> 30:41.296
My father is the king,
which makes me the princess.

30:41.381 --> 30:44.424
Father, l think this peasant
has gone mad with the plague!

30:44.509 --> 30:47.970
For everyone knows
l am the true princess of the land.

30:49.556 --> 30:53.517
My loyal, filthy subjects,
surely you assholes recognize me.

30:53.601 --> 30:56.937
lmposter!

31:08.658 --> 31:12.035
Guys? l think the Jew Producer
was telling the truth.

31:12.120 --> 31:15.789
l think l'm a fake.
l think we're all fakes!

31:15.874 --> 31:17.958
Oh, my God. You know what l think?

31:18.042 --> 31:20.127
Duh!

31:21.087 --> 31:22.921
To the dungeon with them!

31:33.725 --> 31:36.268
It ain't where it is and it ain't where it ain't

31:36.352 --> 31:38.437
lt's a little stinky thing l call a taint

31:38.521 --> 31:40.898
Why don't you suck it, why don't you suck it?

31:40.982 --> 31:43.400
Why don't you suck my little taint?

31:43.484 --> 31:46.403
It ain't where it was and it taint where it ain't

31:46.487 --> 31:48.488
And it's something they call my stinky taint

31:48.573 --> 31:51.074
Why don't you suck it, why don't you suck it?

31:51.159 --> 31:53.744
Why don't you suck it?

31:53.828 --> 31:56.788
-What the hell is this?
-This is horrible!

31:56.873 --> 32:00.375
She's a little girl who sings about her taint!

32:00.460 --> 32:01.668
lt's genius!

32:01.753 --> 32:04.671
-Why don't you suck
-Why don't you suck

32:04.756 --> 32:09.676
Why don't you suck her stinky little taint?

32:10.386 --> 32:12.054
Why don't you suck

32:12.138 --> 32:18.936
-Suck my taint
-Suck my taint

32:19.020 --> 32:21.104
Suck my stinky little taint

32:21.189 --> 32:23.565
-Suck my taint
-Taint

32:23.650 --> 32:27.069
-Suck my taint
-Suck my taint

32:27.153 --> 32:33.200
Come on and suck my stinky little taint

32:34.744 --> 32:37.955
lt's the most beautiful thing l've ever seen!

32:38.039 --> 32:39.373
Don't you see?

32:39.457 --> 32:42.751
lt taint corporate greed,
and it taint the politicians

32:42.835 --> 32:47.214
who have drained our economy.
lt's the lack of personal responsibility.

32:49.300 --> 32:51.760
-That is so true.
-l never thought of that before.

32:51.844 --> 32:53.470
l normally don't laugh at taint humor,

32:53.554 --> 32:55.847
but this is wrapped in
such an important message.

32:55.932 --> 32:57.432
Why don't you suck

32:57.517 --> 33:02.145
-Suck my taint
-Suck my taint

33:02.230 --> 33:03.230
Suck my taint

33:04.649 --> 33:07.651
And when did it become a crime
to be passionate about your work?

33:07.735 --> 33:11.154
So what if l love the characters l created?
Screw him, right?

33:11.239 --> 33:15.283
And kidnapping my son, whoo, how tacky.
Not to mention clichè!

33:15.368 --> 33:17.494
You don't talk much, do you, l.S.R.A.E.L.?

33:17.578 --> 33:20.330
I.S.R.A.E.L. taIks when
l.S.R.A.E.L. has something to say.

33:20.415 --> 33:22.416
l'm just trying to pass the time, man.

33:22.500 --> 33:25.836
Listen, l know you're a robot,
but don't you have feelings?

33:25.920 --> 33:29.798
l mean, isn't it hard to destroy innocent
people that have never wronged you?

33:29.882 --> 33:31.508
Everyone's wronged l.S.R.A.E.L.

33:31.592 --> 33:32.968
Really? Wow.

33:33.052 --> 33:35.929
lf that's the way you feel, maybe
we'd all be better off if you didn't exist.

33:36.931 --> 33:38.807
l.S.R.A.E.L. has every right to exist!

33:38.891 --> 33:42.853
Ok, ok, dude, relax.
Don't get so defensive.

33:42.937 --> 33:44.980
I.S.R.A.E.L. need rest.

33:51.487 --> 33:54.031
Here? This is where you want to rest?

33:54.115 --> 33:56.867
This is the single most dangerous place
you could be situated!

33:56.951 --> 33:59.578
There are so many other
places you could be, l.S.R.A.E.L.,

33:59.662 --> 34:02.164
that would be safer and
would cause less problems!

34:02.248 --> 34:03.457
Why here?

34:03.541 --> 34:06.001
I.S.R.A.E.L. shouIdn't have to Ieave.
Everyone else should leave.

34:06.085 --> 34:07.502
They're the ones who are stupid.

34:07.587 --> 34:10.547
Oy! l.S.R.A.E.L., you are a handful.

34:13.301 --> 34:18.054
l'm sorry, Drawn Togethergang.
But l have to save my Jew son.

34:18.139 --> 34:21.266
Oh, l.S.R.A.E.L., l think
l know where they are.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.275
Oh, yeah.

34:30.359 --> 34:34.196
l haven't seen this many shit-covered
rodents since my last colonoscopy.

34:34.280 --> 34:35.405
-Ta!

34:37.116 --> 34:42.536
Oh, it's ok, Clara.
So we're not who we think we are.

34:42.621 --> 34:45.791
-So what, right?
-So what?

34:45.875 --> 34:47.501
lf l'm not a princess,

34:47.585 --> 34:51.045
then l'm just another beautiful virgin
with real C-cups and a super tight ass

34:51.130 --> 34:54.132
that continuously vibrates
and tastes like wild berries.

34:54.342 --> 34:56.635
Who could ever love someone like that?

34:58.429 --> 35:03.266
Dungeon master, make sure the guillotine
is not too far back on the stage.

35:03.351 --> 35:07.813
l want the people in the
front row to have to wear rain ponchos.

35:07.897 --> 35:12.484
Milord, perhaps you could see it in your heart
to let me live here in your kingdom

35:12.568 --> 35:16.863
and give me the opportunity to be
the real princess l always thought l was.

35:16.948 --> 35:21.368
For l can be just as good as the officially
sanctioned princesses in your kingdom.

35:21.452 --> 35:22.911
Allow me.

35:34.215 --> 35:37.801
Yeah, Clara! She's doing it! lt's working!

35:37.885 --> 35:40.971
For fuck's sake, Xandir!
l'm trying to impress the goddamn king!

35:41.055 --> 35:45.016
And l can't fucking sing if you keep
flapping those dick-sucking lips of yours!

35:50.857 --> 35:54.317
Guards, tomorrow, off with their heads!

35:54.402 --> 35:56.653
No, wait! Please!

35:56.737 --> 35:58.613
Release the king, vile peasant!

35:58.698 --> 36:00.949
Hero! Do something!

36:01.033 --> 36:03.201
Oh, yes, of course.
You shouldn't see this, baby.

36:03.286 --> 36:05.871
l know how you are around blood,
and this could easily go that way.

36:11.794 --> 36:14.087
Oh, you totally would
not have been into that.

36:20.469 --> 36:22.637
Excuse me, Suck My Taint Girl, we...

36:22.722 --> 36:25.891
Oh, my goodness!
You guys are from Drawn Together!

36:25.975 --> 36:28.310
Uh, l heard you were all erased.

36:28.394 --> 36:31.980
-You know who we are?
-Well, of course l do, silly.

36:32.064 --> 36:34.983
l'm, like, the taintest fan
of Drawn Together ever.

36:35.067 --> 36:36.985
l tain't missed an episode.

36:37.069 --> 36:39.529
Well, good, 'cause we need your help,
Suck My Taint Girl.

36:39.614 --> 36:41.865
We was canceled,
and we need to get back on TV.

36:41.949 --> 36:43.825
But of course you were canceled.

36:43.910 --> 36:47.204
You guys were filthy and offensive
without ever having a point.

36:47.288 --> 36:50.290
A p-p-p-pa... Pa... Po...

36:50.374 --> 36:55.295
Po... Po... Poi...

36:55.630 --> 36:58.924
Poi... Aah... Poi... Ohh...

36:59.008 --> 37:01.134
Ohh... Ahh... Oint?

37:01.219 --> 37:04.429
Yeah! You know, like social commentary.

37:04.513 --> 37:08.058
Everybody knows that these days,
if you want to be raunchy and funny on TV,

37:08.142 --> 37:10.894
you need to also be relentlessly preachy.

37:10.978 --> 37:14.564
-Too bad we never had a point.
-Hey. Know what you should do?

37:14.649 --> 37:16.107
You should go to Make-A-Point Land

37:16.192 --> 37:18.485
and get yourself a point
from the MakeA-Point wizard.

37:18.569 --> 37:20.904
You'll be back on the air in no time!

37:20.988 --> 37:25.575
Really? Because if you're lying, l'll cut you.
l'll cut you to the fucking bone.

37:25.660 --> 37:30.497
Ooh! Can you take us to this
Make-A-Point Land, Suck My Taint Girl?

37:30.581 --> 37:36.378
Well, l really shouldn't be seen with
you guys, but l could be convinced

37:36.462 --> 37:38.964
if you introduced me
to the rest of the Drawn Togethergang.

37:39.048 --> 37:42.425
Huh? What do you say? ls it a deal?

37:48.349 --> 37:50.475
No, Molly, you're the cutest.

37:50.559 --> 37:52.227
No, you are!

37:52.311 --> 37:56.273
Watching Hero and his whorish
know-it-all girlfriend made me sick.

37:56.357 --> 38:00.902
l had to get Hero to break up with Molly
so l could have my best friend back.

38:00.987 --> 38:02.779
And l had just the plan.

38:03.364 --> 38:05.615
Got it?

38:05.700 --> 38:08.285
Now, follow my lead, and don't fuck it up.

38:08.369 --> 38:09.536
Uh, Xandir?

38:17.128 --> 38:18.795
Wait, wait. Best friend in Ling...

38:18.879 --> 38:20.964
Oh, God!

38:21.048 --> 38:24.426
Asians are hilarious!

38:24.552 --> 38:26.011
Come on, Ling-Ling.

38:26.095 --> 38:30.348
Ling-Ling into depression go

38:30.433 --> 38:34.519
He blew his chance with Xandir

38:34.603 --> 38:38.648
Xandir only have eyes for Hero

38:38.733 --> 38:42.193
Ling-Ling die alone

38:44.030 --> 38:47.615
What was that, Molly?
You have the perfect escape plan?

38:47.700 --> 38:49.743
We'll be out of here in no time?

38:49.827 --> 38:52.662
Really, Molly? Oh, that's awesome!

38:52.747 --> 38:54.831
When Molly just
lies there and does nothing,

38:54.915 --> 38:56.875
we'll all be executed in the morning,

38:56.959 --> 39:00.837
and Hero will finally realize
how lame his dead girlfriend is.

39:00.921 --> 39:02.422
l'm so clever!

39:02.506 --> 39:04.341
Oh, l can't stand it!

39:04.592 --> 39:07.052
Well, the guards are coming, Molly.

39:07.136 --> 39:11.598
We can't wait to see
your plan in action, can we, guys?

39:14.602 --> 39:17.437
Molly... Come on, do something.

39:17.521 --> 39:20.774
You're embarrassing me
in front of all my guy friends.

39:24.320 --> 39:26.196
Oh, maybe they were right about you.

39:26.280 --> 39:27.322
Maybe we should just break...

39:27.406 --> 39:32.327
-Whoa! That prisoner doesn't look so hot!
-She's pale, and that rat is eating her eyeball.

39:33.579 --> 39:34.871
We better do something!

39:36.499 --> 39:39.626
Ooh! Clever, clever.

39:44.548 --> 39:47.258
Psst! That guard outfit makes you look fat.

39:47.343 --> 39:50.178
lt does?

39:50.262 --> 39:52.972
Oh, great! Now l'll have
to deal with that all night.

39:53.057 --> 39:54.224
Ryan, wait up!

39:54.308 --> 39:58.061
Molly, your plan worked like a charm!
Oh, l'm so happy!

39:58.145 --> 40:01.898
Later on, l'm gonna let you
fuck me in the mouth!

40:01.982 --> 40:04.943
-God damn it!
-Now, let's get out of here.

40:07.238 --> 40:08.988
Hey, the prisoners have escaped!

40:11.367 --> 40:12.492
Come on, Clara!

40:12.576 --> 40:17.330
No. l have nothing to live for anymore.
l'm not a princess. Now, go.

40:17.415 --> 40:20.041
l'll slow them down for you.
lt's the only way.

40:20.126 --> 40:23.711
Thanks, Clara. You'll always
be a princess to me. Here.

40:23.796 --> 40:26.548
No, you keep them.
They're of no use to me now.

40:26.632 --> 40:28.007
l'll treasure them always.

40:28.801 --> 40:30.969
Wait, Xandir, do me one favor.

40:31.053 --> 40:33.221
Live your gay life to the fullest.

40:33.305 --> 40:35.223
-Will do.
-Every day's a gift.

40:35.307 --> 40:38.435
-Gotcha.
-And find that one special person.

40:38.519 --> 40:40.061
Sure thing. Bye!

40:40.146 --> 40:43.731
And hold him close
and tell him with all your heart

40:43.816 --> 40:47.402
that you can't marry him.
The Bible forbids it.

40:47.486 --> 40:48.695
l really gotta go.

40:48.779 --> 40:51.364
Ok. Bye! Don't adopt!

41:02.001 --> 41:03.084
Give me those!

41:13.721 --> 41:15.930
Molly hath saved the day!

41:24.148 --> 41:26.608
Holy fuck, it's l.S.R.A.E.L. !

41:27.610 --> 41:29.444
Uh, hey, guys, how are you?

41:29.528 --> 41:31.571
Uh, l'd get the hell
out of here if l were you.

41:31.655 --> 41:33.072
-Huzzah!

41:41.248 --> 41:44.167
So tired. So very, very tired.

41:44.251 --> 41:46.503
Don't you give up, fool horse.

41:46.587 --> 41:48.421
We got to make it to the kingdom

41:48.506 --> 41:52.800
to get the rest of our gang
so we can all get to Make-A-Point Land.

41:52.885 --> 41:57.889
And then, we still need to find Toot.
This is a joke. We'll never find everyone.

42:00.768 --> 42:04.771
l said, we'll never find everyone.

42:10.319 --> 42:12.028
Look! There them are-uh!

42:13.447 --> 42:14.614
And l.S.R.A.E.L. !

42:20.663 --> 42:21.955
Whee...

42:22.039 --> 42:24.249
Are all together again!

42:24.333 --> 42:25.750
Wait. Where's Clara?

42:26.126 --> 42:28.086
Oh, Clara? She's dead.

42:29.296 --> 42:30.380
Oh, no.

42:33.425 --> 42:34.592
-Yeah!
-Oh, good!

42:34.677 --> 42:37.345
-Well, that takes the sting off.
-Her arms were always my favorite part of her.

42:41.350 --> 42:44.394
Ashes to ashes, smurf to smurf.

42:44.478 --> 42:46.896
l'm glad you're dead, you bastard!

42:46.981 --> 42:50.900
l hope you smurf in hell for what
you did to me in front of my kids!

42:50.985 --> 42:53.570
l hope you smurf in hell!

42:56.407 --> 42:59.701
lt's ok, sweetie.
Our long national nightmare is over.

42:59.785 --> 43:03.788
He can't hurt us anymore.
The important thing is that you survived.

43:03.872 --> 43:06.332
-We all survived.

43:23.517 --> 43:25.685
Say good-bye, Drawn Together!

43:25.769 --> 43:27.353
No!

43:27.438 --> 43:28.521
-I can't see!

43:28.606 --> 43:30.440
-I can't see!

43:36.572 --> 43:39.198
Ugh! Holy crap! l can't open the door.

43:39.283 --> 43:41.701
lt's stuck! We gonna drown!

43:44.288 --> 43:47.248
Don't worry, people. l'll get us out.

43:49.084 --> 43:51.711
Yeah, there you are.

43:52.880 --> 43:55.423
Uhh... That wasn't well thought-out.

44:05.684 --> 44:09.646
No!

44:09.730 --> 44:11.564
l loved you!

44:12.775 --> 44:15.443
The Drawn Together gang is gone forever.

44:15.527 --> 44:17.528
Ok. We're on our way.

44:24.286 --> 44:26.913
Molly, this may be it for us.

44:29.750 --> 44:30.708
Commentary.

44:30.793 --> 44:32.710
-Commentary?
-Commonary.

44:32.795 --> 44:35.505
They usually have director's
commissary on these things.

44:35.589 --> 44:37.006
Let's listen to the commonary.

44:37.091 --> 44:39.175
Maybe they'll tell us
how to get out of here.

44:39.259 --> 44:41.511
lt's too late. We're all gonna die!

44:41.595 --> 44:43.179
We have to try!

44:46.392 --> 44:47.892
Menu.

44:47.976 --> 44:49.519
Commentary.

44:49.603 --> 44:50.978
Commentary on.

44:51.063 --> 44:52.772
And play!

44:52.856 --> 44:56.109
So, wow.
This movie just keeps on going.

44:56.193 --> 44:57.235
-lt's, uh...
-l hear them!

44:57.319 --> 44:58.695
-lt's a long thing... This movie...
-Help!

44:58.779 --> 45:01.781
-How do we get out of here?
-Shut the fuck up and listen!

45:01.865 --> 45:04.242
Actually might very well be a bad idea,

45:04.326 --> 45:07.537
but, um, Dave...
Dave, he needed the money.

45:07.621 --> 45:10.039
Well, Matt...
Matt married into money.

45:10.124 --> 45:11.999
Who the hell would
ever want to listen to this?

45:12.084 --> 45:14.544
lt used to be money.
Now, nobody has money...

45:14.628 --> 45:17.380
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Get to the point!

45:17.464 --> 45:19.132
All right. So now we got,
uh, we got the gang,

45:19.216 --> 45:21.342
we put them all in this pumpkin.
We put them underwater,

45:21.427 --> 45:23.886
and originally, this scene
wasn't even in the script at all.

45:23.971 --> 45:25.722
The only reason we did this is 'cause,

45:25.806 --> 45:27.598
well, we both thought
that I.S.R.A.E.L...

45:27.683 --> 45:30.476
We had to remind the audience that
l.S.R.A.E.L. is still chasing after them.

45:30.561 --> 45:31.936
Well, you thought they had to.

45:32.020 --> 45:34.105
l remember thinking
we didn't really need this whole scene.

45:34.189 --> 45:36.232
We were going with a new
production company, and...

45:36.316 --> 45:39.569
But l didn't want to fight with you.
l remember being so exhausted, at this point.

45:39.653 --> 45:41.404
My wife was, like, 9 months pregnant,

45:41.488 --> 45:42.947
and we were, like,
in the middle of moving, right?

45:43.031 --> 45:44.907
You're, like, the first person
that ever had a kid.

45:44.992 --> 45:46.117
That's how you act.

45:46.201 --> 45:48.536
l actually remember...

45:48.620 --> 45:52.081
l'm the first person that ever had a kid
and had to argue with you at the same time.

45:52.166 --> 45:54.292
You have got to be shitting me.

45:54.376 --> 45:56.043
How the hell are we going
to get them out of this scene?

45:56.128 --> 45:58.212
We don't have any ideas, and l think...

45:58.297 --> 45:59.589
l'm pretty sure you're the one who's like,

45:59.673 --> 46:01.507
"Hey, why don't they
just suck on Xandir's dick,

46:01.592 --> 46:03.217
"and Xandir's dick's got oxygen,"

46:03.302 --> 46:06.471
'cause you're always like... The first idea is,
"Hey, they can suck each other's dicks!"

46:06.555 --> 46:08.514
Oh, yeah. That's a good idea.

46:08.599 --> 46:11.517
l think your idea was,
"What if Xandir poos oxygen?"

46:11.602 --> 46:14.270
Oh, no. "What if he farts oxygen,
so they have to suck his ass?"

46:14.354 --> 46:15.563
So yours was that much better.

46:15.647 --> 46:17.315
-That's smarter.
-Oh, for the love of God.

46:17.399 --> 46:18.775
This is horrible!

46:18.859 --> 46:20.401
I don't even remember
how we got out of this.

46:20.486 --> 46:21.694
Oh, you know what it was?

46:21.779 --> 46:23.154
This is how we come out
with a Iot of these scenes.

46:23.238 --> 46:25.031
lt's, like, who haven't we used in a while?

46:25.115 --> 46:28.451
Like, Ling-Ling? What if we pull his tail,
and he infIates Iike a raft?

46:28.535 --> 46:31.454
-That's fine, that's fine.
-So theyjust do that.

46:31.538 --> 46:33.122
At a certain point,
it's just like "whatever."

46:33.207 --> 46:38.002
Ooh, l gots an idea, gang.
Let's use Ling-Ling as an inflatable raft.

46:38.086 --> 46:40.463
So, anyway, l guess if this
scene's going to be worth it at all,

46:40.547 --> 46:42.215
maybe we should at least see Foxxy's tits.

46:42.299 --> 46:43.800
-I'm in.
-But first,

46:43.884 --> 46:45.384
let me take off my shirt.

47:00.275 --> 47:03.778
We made it! Whee!

47:03.862 --> 47:05.321
Nice tits, Foxxy.

47:05.405 --> 47:09.242
Good work, gang.
Now let's go find Toot.

47:09.743 --> 47:11.869
Now, the only one
we needed was Toot,

47:11.954 --> 47:17.959
so we set off on ourjourney to find her,
a journey of excitement and adventure,

47:18.043 --> 47:21.546
mystery and mayhem, love and loss,

47:21.630 --> 47:25.174
a journey that carried us
to far-away lands

47:25.259 --> 47:31.848
and taught us so much about
what was right here inside us all along.

47:31.932 --> 47:36.394
A journey which would change us all forever.

47:36.478 --> 47:37.687
And then, we found her fat ass.

47:39.356 --> 47:42.358
Foxxy, what the hell are you doing here?

47:42.442 --> 47:45.236
We can't be seen together.
You'll get us killed.

47:45.320 --> 47:46.863
Toot, you got to come with me.

47:46.947 --> 47:48.906
You not safe here anymore, fatty.

47:48.991 --> 47:52.034
You don't know that.
You don't know anything.

47:52.119 --> 47:53.494
l know this.

47:57.958 --> 48:00.585
Put on your 3-D glasses now!

48:00.669 --> 48:01.878
3-D glasses not included.

48:12.014 --> 48:14.390
FOXXY: Yeah, girl.
That's what the Foxxy want.

48:14.474 --> 48:16.559
One finger?

48:16.643 --> 48:19.645
Girl, you got to come back when
you can at least kick in a big toe.

48:19.730 --> 48:23.232
What are you guys doing? Making out?

48:23.317 --> 48:26.694
Hey, lady, less talky,
more threesome action.

48:39.541 --> 48:42.835
Yes! God damn it, l miss Drawn Together.

48:42.920 --> 48:44.420
Hold on. Oh, my God!

48:44.504 --> 48:46.923
Where do you want it?
Where do you want it?

48:47.007 --> 48:48.299
Anywhere but the face.

48:48.383 --> 48:52.762
l mean, that is really degrading to women.
l mean, you could really...

48:52.846 --> 48:56.515
-l deserved that.
-You deserve to die.

48:58.435 --> 48:59.727
Get out ofthere now!

49:01.021 --> 49:02.104
Let's go! Go! Go! Go!

49:08.445 --> 49:11.030
Stop! l can't fly without my feather!

49:22.000 --> 49:23.793
Got it! Let's go!

49:32.844 --> 49:37.181
Burn in hell, you fat
fucking homewrecking bitch!

49:37.265 --> 49:38.808
lt's a living.

49:42.980 --> 49:44.814
Outrageous!

49:44.898 --> 49:47.817
How did you think you were
going to get away with this?

49:47.901 --> 49:50.778
A foul-mouthed clone of my daughter.

49:50.862 --> 49:54.448
What if some child actually thought
it was her using the word shitcunt?

49:54.533 --> 49:57.827
l understand. But we are taking measures.

49:57.911 --> 50:00.413
We are taking measures, too. Ooh!

50:00.872 --> 50:02.206
-What the...

50:05.585 --> 50:07.712
Target has been eliminated.

50:07.796 --> 50:11.007
Just to be on the safe side,
erase the whole place.

50:11.091 --> 50:14.844
And get back here when you're done.
There's been a change of plans.

50:14.928 --> 50:18.514
But sir, this is the happiest place on earth.

50:18.598 --> 50:21.475
lt was the happiest place on earth.

50:23.895 --> 50:26.480
Erase it aII.

50:27.107 --> 50:29.108
lt's a world of laughter

50:30.444 --> 50:32.403
It's a worId of sunshine

50:43.957 --> 50:46.042
After we got Toot back from Bedrock,

50:46.126 --> 50:48.711
we immediately brought
her to Suck My Taint Girl.

50:48.795 --> 50:52.631
You're all here! Hooray!

50:52.716 --> 50:54.800
Wait. Where's Clara?

50:56.303 --> 51:00.264
And we told Suck My Taint Girl
the terribIe news about Clara.

51:00.348 --> 51:02.558
-What?
-She took it pretty hard.

51:04.061 --> 51:07.897
But after a long talk and
a respectaful memoryial service,

51:07.981 --> 51:11.317
Suck My Taint Girl agreed to
take us to Make-A-Point Land,

51:11.401 --> 51:15.404
help us find the Make-A-Point wizard, get
our point, and get our show back on the air,

51:15.489 --> 51:19.825
hence redeeming myself for
getting us all into this mess in the first place.

51:21.536 --> 51:24.038
Uh, why did you say all that?

51:24.122 --> 51:27.166
Sorry, giving confessionals
is a hard habit to break.

51:27.250 --> 51:29.502
Well, it seems kind of crazy.

51:31.463 --> 51:34.757
You know what's crazy?
You ass-bags dragging me here.

51:34.841 --> 51:38.469
When my Barney comes for me,
you'll all get yours.

51:41.139 --> 51:43.432
This is great and all, but can we
get going to Make-A-Point Land

51:43.517 --> 51:44.767
before l.S.R.A.E.L. finds us?

51:44.851 --> 51:46.477
Tain't no time like the present.

51:46.561 --> 51:47.853
But remember,

51:47.938 --> 51:52.316
there are lots of magical and mysterious
creatures in Make-A-Point Land,

51:52.400 --> 51:53.776
and they don't take too kindly

51:53.860 --> 51:57.530
to those who are disgusting
for the sake of being disgusting.

52:02.119 --> 52:04.745
What? l'm sorry. l got distracted.
What were you saying?

52:06.706 --> 52:10.584
l was saying it's time we go.
Let's taint the town brown!

52:21.596 --> 52:25.933
Uh, question. Why is your ship
plugged into the ass of that animal?

52:27.686 --> 52:32.398
Oh, Mr. Ham. l'm so glad you asked,
because you're going to love this.

52:32.482 --> 52:37.153
This ship is powered by... Wait for it...

52:37.237 --> 52:38.279
Poo!

52:40.782 --> 52:44.535
A feces-fueled rocket ship? That's awesome!

52:44.619 --> 52:48.080
Yep. This ship is an ear of corn
powered by bull shit

52:48.165 --> 52:52.585
because, don't you see, ethanol is bullshit.

52:52.919 --> 52:54.879
Oh, yeah. l get it.

52:55.380 --> 52:58.507
l kind of liked it better when
it was just a shit-powered rocket.

52:59.801 --> 53:02.011
T-minus 5, 4,

53:02.095 --> 53:04.847
3, 2, 1 .

53:04.931 --> 53:06.432
Liftoff.

53:12.898 --> 53:14.481
Well, l gotta hit the head.

53:14.566 --> 53:16.859
Don't go changing while l'm away.

53:20.488 --> 53:22.823
l am sick of it
just being the 2 of us.

53:23.992 --> 53:26.869
Playing hot potato just sucks
without my beloved Hero.

53:26.953 --> 53:28.829
And l love hot potato!

53:28.914 --> 53:32.875
Ling-Ling make sad realization

53:32.959 --> 53:36.962
Xandir's heart is with another

53:37.130 --> 53:41.884
if Ling-Ling really loves Xandir
like he says he does

53:41.968 --> 53:45.721
He'll help Xandir get back Hero

53:51.686 --> 53:52.895
What? Molly!

53:52.979 --> 53:55.356
You promised me we'd go to prom together!

53:55.440 --> 53:58.108
l can't believe you would do this to me!

54:00.820 --> 54:02.238
Later

54:03.698 --> 54:06.742
Guys, it's over between me and Molly.

54:08.203 --> 54:13.540
Oh, there you go. lt's ok.
Cry on my shoulder, darling.

54:13.625 --> 54:17.086
-Hyah!
-Look, Make-A-Point Land!

54:17.170 --> 54:18.420
Where? l can't see it.

54:18.505 --> 54:19.838
lt's right over there between

54:19.923 --> 54:21.924
Why-You-So-Bitter-
About-Being-Canceled Land

54:22.008 --> 54:24.551
and You-Had-3-Or-4-Seasons,
You-Should-Be-Happy-With-What-You-Got,

54:24.636 --> 54:26.136
Most-Shows-Don't-Even-Get-That Land.

54:29.891 --> 54:34.395
Hold onto my taint, everyone!
lt's going to be a rough landing.

54:43.571 --> 54:47.283
Here we are, Make-A-Point Land!

54:48.702 --> 54:51.412
Put on your 3-D glasses now!

54:51.496 --> 54:53.163
3-D glasses not included.

54:59.879 --> 55:04.758
3-D! The technology
of the eighties, but it's now!

55:07.178 --> 55:08.721
Whoa! Whoa!

55:24.487 --> 55:25.529
lt looks fake.

55:25.613 --> 55:28.907
Let's move quickly, and don't
taint any attention to yourselves.

55:33.413 --> 55:37.082
-That's a fetus tornado.
-Huh? A fetus tornado?

55:37.167 --> 55:42.171
Don't you see? People just go round and
round when it comes to stem cell research.

55:42.255 --> 55:44.006
Well. Not as funny.

55:44.549 --> 55:48.010
Ray-Ray 2 through 7! Mama love you!

55:52.599 --> 55:54.475
-Cool!

55:56.227 --> 55:59.021
The Pfizersaurus Rex! Don't you see?

55:59.105 --> 56:01.857
lf we keep listening to
the pharmaceutical companies,

56:01.941 --> 56:04.818
one day, we, too, will be extinct.

56:04.903 --> 56:06.445
Not so cool anymore.

56:06.529 --> 56:08.197
Come on, gang. Let's keep moving

56:08.281 --> 56:11.033
before we get spotted by
floating Tom Brokaw made of semen.

56:11.117 --> 56:15.037
Floating Tom Brokaw made of semen?
What the fuck is his point?

56:15.121 --> 56:20.626
Maybe that the media is dumb
and superficial and delicious?

56:21.669 --> 56:23.921
Look! The wizard's palace!

56:29.010 --> 56:33.055
Oh, no! lt's the Giant
Who Shits lnto His Own Mouth!

56:36.476 --> 56:41.730
Fee, fi, fo, fums!
l smell pointless abominations!

56:41.815 --> 56:44.566
l must kill you!

56:47.070 --> 56:49.405
Wait, Giant Who Shits lnto His Own Mouth!

56:49.489 --> 56:51.573
Now, l know my Drawn Togetherfriends

56:51.658 --> 56:54.743
are stupid, pointless, crude creatures
of mediocre comedy.

56:54.828 --> 56:59.415
That's why l brought them here.
To get a point. You can't kill them!

56:59.499 --> 57:02.626
l can do anything l want!

57:02.710 --> 57:05.963
Except get the taste of shit out of my mouth.

57:07.715 --> 57:10.801
Hold up, Giant Who
Shits lnto His Own Mouth.

57:10.885 --> 57:13.595
You saying you don't like eating shit?

57:13.680 --> 57:18.392
l eat shit all day, every day, 24/7.
Of course l don't like it.

57:18.476 --> 57:21.854
But it's how l was born.

57:24.315 --> 57:27.818
Well, what if we help you?
Then would you let us go?

57:27.902 --> 57:29.820
Mmm-hmm.

57:30.113 --> 57:34.283
lf only we had something
we could tie to the giant's head

57:34.367 --> 57:37.202
to interrupt the flow of poop.

57:42.959 --> 57:46.044
lt's working! lt's working!

57:51.509 --> 57:52.718
Amen.

57:52.802 --> 57:55.804
Hallelujah. Your way talking.

57:55.889 --> 57:59.641
l... l can't taste shit,
for the first time in my whole life!

57:59.726 --> 58:01.810
Thank you! Oh, thank you!

58:01.895 --> 58:05.397
l'm finally free! l can eat whatever l want now!

58:05.482 --> 58:06.565
Anything!

58:06.649 --> 58:09.568
That's right, Giant. Anything!

58:13.448 --> 58:14.740
Would you shit in my mouth?

58:16.784 --> 58:19.661
Well, guys, here we are.

58:22.165 --> 58:23.749
lmpressive.

58:24.042 --> 58:27.377
Thanks, Suck My Taint Girl.
The Make-A-Point wizard's got to help.

58:27.462 --> 58:28.921
He's just gotta.

58:29.005 --> 58:33.050
Uh, any chance there's a
Wrap-This-Thing-Up-Already wizard in there?

58:34.052 --> 58:37.513
l can't believe the MakeA-Point wizard
finally gave me my point.

58:37.597 --> 58:40.390
Of course! l represent the
duality of goodness and martyrdom

58:40.475 --> 58:43.602
and the unencumbered id that is repressed
when religion meets sexuality.

58:43.686 --> 58:45.187
And crab.

58:46.105 --> 58:47.397
-Come on.

58:47.482 --> 58:49.942
Let's get ourselves back on the air.

58:53.029 --> 58:57.407
Who has come forth seeking a point, hmm?

58:58.535 --> 59:03.956
Your Majesty, l humbly present to you
what's left of the Drawn Togethergang.

59:05.124 --> 59:09.920
Oh, my. You kids have
caused quite a bit of trouble.

59:10.004 --> 59:13.674
Honestly, l don't
even think a point can help.

59:14.884 --> 59:17.553
You Honor, dis is our only shot.

59:17.637 --> 59:22.266
lf we don't get the Drawn Together
back on TV, we ain't never gonna be safe.

59:22.350 --> 59:25.185
Please, Mr. Wizard. Without my TV persona,

59:25.270 --> 59:27.688
l'm just another 33-year-old
schizophrenic drug addict

59:27.772 --> 59:29.731
with jaundice and several deformities.

59:29.816 --> 59:34.069
Fine, fine. Sheesh! l'll give you a point.

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:03.348
lmpressive.

01:00:03.725 --> 01:00:05.767
Well, this is it, y'all.

01:00:05.852 --> 01:00:08.604
We's about to get our point,
get back on the air,

01:00:08.688 --> 01:00:11.356
and things can finally
get back to the way they was.

01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:17.529
Don't you see?

01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:22.451
Don't you see? Don't you see?

01:00:23.703 --> 01:00:25.621
Wait! Maybe we shouldn't open it.

01:00:25.705 --> 01:00:28.123
What the fuck are you talking about, Spanky?

01:00:28.207 --> 01:00:29.583
Yeah! Just open it!

01:00:29.667 --> 01:00:33.003
This doesn't seem right.
l mean, maybe we don't want a point.

01:00:33.087 --> 01:00:36.632
Don't you see? lf l can't fart or vomit

01:00:36.716 --> 01:00:41.053
or fill up an ice tray with the
afterbirth of Foxxy's miscarriage

01:00:41.137 --> 01:00:45.766
and hand them out as ice pops to
terminally ill children on my hospital tours

01:00:45.850 --> 01:00:51.104
without making some kind of point,
then maybe it's just not worth it.

01:00:58.488 --> 01:01:03.367
And l don't want to let dead chicks
fuck me in my mouth for social commentary.

01:01:03.451 --> 01:01:07.037
l mean, what's wrong with just
doing it 'cause it makes me feel good?

01:01:07.121 --> 01:01:09.623
And l sure do like
getting pregnant for no reason.

01:01:09.707 --> 01:01:11.875
You know what? l agree with the pig.

01:01:11.959 --> 01:01:13.335
Thank you.

01:01:13.419 --> 01:01:15.504
So, Mr. Make-A-Point wizard,

01:01:15.588 --> 01:01:18.298
l guess we don't want
to make-a-point after all.

01:01:18.383 --> 01:01:19.925
Maybe that's the point.

01:01:22.929 --> 01:01:24.096
Fuck you guys!

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:27.474
l need Drawn Together!
Otherwise, l don't exist!

01:01:27.558 --> 01:01:30.686
-No, wait! lt's...
-What the...

01:01:36.609 --> 01:01:38.527
-Wooldoor!
-What the fuck, wizard?

01:01:38.611 --> 01:01:43.865
l'm sorry. l had no choice.
They said they'd kill me.

01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:45.492
Who would kill you?

01:01:45.576 --> 01:01:48.912
Hello there, Drawn Togethergang.

01:01:50.289 --> 01:01:53.959
lt's a pleasure to finally meet you face to face.

01:01:54.043 --> 01:01:57.212
So you the dick that's been trying to kill us.

01:01:57.296 --> 01:01:59.715
How the hell did you even
know we was coming here?

01:01:59.799 --> 01:02:02.008
-l told them.

01:02:02.093 --> 01:02:03.468
Suck My Taint Girl?

01:02:06.139 --> 01:02:09.599
Roved you?
Drawn Together is the lamest show ever!

01:02:09.684 --> 01:02:12.394
Watching it was like watching taint dry.

01:02:12.478 --> 01:02:16.064
And if l let you get a point,
you might get your timeslot back.

01:02:16.149 --> 01:02:18.108
Why the fuck would l do that?

01:02:21.028 --> 01:02:22.237
Damn that girl.

01:02:22.321 --> 01:02:25.907
Like my lawn after a visit from that klansman
with short-term memory loss,

01:02:25.992 --> 01:02:27.367
we've been double crossed.

01:02:27.452 --> 01:02:29.578
-Nice work, honey.
-Thanks, Scott.

01:02:29.662 --> 01:02:31.997
-Mmm.
-That's right. Suck my taint.

01:02:32.081 --> 01:02:34.958
Damn you, Suck My Taint Girl.
You betrayed us.

01:02:35.042 --> 01:02:37.127
And then, you didn't
even give us a fair fight.

01:02:37.211 --> 01:02:40.672
Sometimes, l don't know if
you're an asshole or a pussy,

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:42.382
or something in between.

01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:48.221
Now, l.S.R.A.E.L.,

01:02:48.306 --> 01:02:52.517
on behalf of my dead wife and
daughter from a previous marriage,

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:54.436
erase them all!

01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:58.273
Don't worry.

01:02:58.357 --> 01:03:01.860
Barney will be here any second to save us.
l just know it.

01:03:10.244 --> 01:03:14.748
At least we're going to die together,
Drawn Together.

01:03:20.046 --> 01:03:23.715
Please, l.S.R.A.E.L., l know
they're obscene, pointless rip-offs,

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:27.344
but l... l... Love them.

01:03:27.428 --> 01:03:28.970
-Fag.
Ahem. Jew's a homo.

01:03:29.055 --> 01:03:32.349
Move, Jew Producer,
or l will destroy you as well.

01:03:32.433 --> 01:03:34.726
You can't do this, l.S.R.A.E.L. Don't you see?

01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:38.688
Even though everyone hates the Drawn
Togethergang, they have a right to exist.

01:03:38.773 --> 01:03:41.650
Surely you understand that,
don't you, l.S.R.A.E.L.?

01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:52.327
l.S.R.A.E.L. doesn't want to destroy.
l.S.R.A.E.L. wants to peacefully coexist.

01:03:53.162 --> 01:03:56.498
That's all l.S.R.A.E.L. ever wanted.

01:03:58.376 --> 01:04:01.086
No wonder everyone hates you, l.S.R.A.E.L.

01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:04.381
You're so goddamn aggravating.

01:04:04.465 --> 01:04:08.677
l said destroy them, you fucking idiot!

01:04:08.761 --> 01:04:12.055
That's it! I.S.R.A.E.L. wiII not Iet
you bully her around anymore.

01:04:15.184 --> 01:04:17.978
l.S.R.A.E.L. really is our greatest ally.

01:04:20.731 --> 01:04:21.857
That's a bit much.

01:04:21.941 --> 01:04:24.693
l.S.R.A.E.L.'s going
a bit overboard again.

01:04:32.410 --> 01:04:35.453
Why in the hell are you laughing?
You're gonna die.

01:04:35.538 --> 01:04:38.039
Because of this.

01:04:45.423 --> 01:04:51.636
l have enough e-5 to destroy
all of MakeA-Point Land.

01:04:51.721 --> 01:04:56.808
Looks like l'll be enjoying
the Drawn Togethergang in hell!

01:05:01.522 --> 01:05:03.857
You gots a real weird sense of humor.

01:05:03.941 --> 01:05:06.151
Hero, do something!

01:05:06.235 --> 01:05:09.821
l miss Molly!

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:14.117
Looks like it's up to ol' fatass again.

01:05:22.001 --> 01:05:26.379
That is totally not what l meant to do.

01:05:26.464 --> 01:05:29.174
The Drawn Togethergang must die!

01:05:29.258 --> 01:05:31.760
Oh, no, you don't!

01:05:31.844 --> 01:05:36.473
Everyone, run, run!
Don't worry about the old...

01:05:36.557 --> 01:05:40.352
Um, they left, like, 5 minutes ago.

01:05:40.686 --> 01:05:41.978
-Guys!

01:05:42.063 --> 01:05:44.356
l haven't been laid in 6 months!

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:47.734
l have an erection right now,
and l don't know how long it will last!

01:05:47.818 --> 01:05:49.569
l'm just putting that out there.

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:52.989
Tain't yours! Taint give it to me!

01:05:53.074 --> 01:05:54.950
Ok, but first, give it to me!

01:05:55.034 --> 01:05:59.454
Don't you see? lf people
all over the world would just...

01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:04.668
Next year in Jerusalem!

01:06:11.759 --> 01:06:13.218
Oh, Lordy!

01:06:13.302 --> 01:06:16.972
Fuck yeah! l'm going to
escape the fuck out of this shit!

01:06:17.348 --> 01:06:19.057
Where the hell are you... Aah!

01:06:20.017 --> 01:06:21.559
Oh, Barney!

01:06:24.522 --> 01:06:27.607
l knew you'd come for me!
l just knew it!

01:06:27.692 --> 01:06:30.360
Uh, yeah. Actually, l just came to tell you

01:06:30.444 --> 01:06:33.321
l worked out everything with my wife.
So we have to end our affair.

01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:35.073
Sorry. Here.

01:06:36.534 --> 01:06:37.993
lt's a living.

01:06:40.871 --> 01:06:42.122
Oh, damn it.

01:06:45.501 --> 01:06:48.086
Oh, Lordy! Oh, now what we gonna do?

01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:51.172
Oh, my God! Get us the fuck out of here!

01:06:51.257 --> 01:06:52.507
Help!

01:06:54.468 --> 01:06:57.429
Hey, you guys!

01:07:16.782 --> 01:07:19.242
Take off your 3-D glasses now.

01:07:19.326 --> 01:07:20.910
3-D glasses not included.

01:07:29.795 --> 01:07:31.921
Yeah, but at least we're alive,

01:07:32.006 --> 01:07:36.051
thanks to you, Giant Who
No Longer Shits lnto His Own Mouth.

01:07:36.135 --> 01:07:37.719
lt's the least l could do.

01:07:37.803 --> 01:07:40.889
l wish there was some way
l could help you get back on the air.

01:07:40.973 --> 01:07:42.307
l think l can help.

01:07:42.808 --> 01:07:46.561
Jew Son! Oh, l'm so sorry about your father.

01:07:46.645 --> 01:07:49.898
lt's ok. He died saving those he loved.

01:07:49.982 --> 01:07:51.274
Fag.
Ahem. Jew's a homo.

01:07:51.358 --> 01:07:54.569
And now that he's gone,
l'm taking over the family business.

01:07:59.492 --> 01:08:03.578
Uh, l don't think so,
but l do have a surprise for you.

01:08:03.662 --> 01:08:06.956
Papa?
-Even better!

01:08:07.625 --> 01:08:09.959
l pulled some Jew strings

01:08:10.044 --> 01:08:12.128
and l think l can get you

01:08:12.213 --> 01:08:15.131
a Direct-to-DVD movie!

01:08:15.424 --> 01:08:18.259
For real-real, not for play-play?

01:08:18.344 --> 01:08:22.305
Yes, Foxxy, for real-real, not for play-play.

01:08:25.643 --> 01:08:27.769
Well, no offense to you guys,

01:08:27.853 --> 01:08:32.774
but l don't want to be in a Direct-to-DVD
movie if it doesn't have a happy ending.

01:08:32.858 --> 01:08:35.193
-Hero, look who l found!

01:08:35.277 --> 01:08:36.778
Molly!

01:08:38.238 --> 01:08:40.823
Oh, l love it when she does that.

01:08:43.786 --> 01:08:45.995
Hey, there, baby. How you doin'?

01:08:47.706 --> 01:08:49.040
You like shitting in people's mouths, right?

01:08:50.751 --> 01:08:55.505
What, Molly? Of course, l'd love
to let you fuck me in my mouth,

01:08:55.589 --> 01:09:00.510
but not tonight,
'cause tonight is guys' night.

01:09:09.435 --> 01:09:10.520
Aw, shitcunt.

01:09:15.818 --> 01:09:17.234
Why don't you suck

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:24.450
-Suck my taint
-Suck my taint

01:09:24.535 --> 01:09:27.787
-Suck my stinky little taint
-Suck my taint

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:30.582
-Suck my taint
-Suck my taint

01:09:31.207 --> 01:09:32.332
Suck my taint

01:09:32.417 --> 01:09:37.796
Come on, and suck my stinky little taint

01:09:47.433 --> 01:09:51.685
Take it up the ass, metaphorically

01:09:52.313 --> 01:09:56.733
Suck on a massive dong, allegorically

01:09:57.234 --> 01:10:01.613
Slather spewing dung
across a sweaty symbolic ass

01:10:01.989 --> 01:10:06.284
And we can make this fuckall a better world

01:10:07.286 --> 01:10:11.497
When you crap yourself, it's an opportunity

01:10:11.832 --> 01:10:16.461
To scoop up the excrement and eat it

01:10:17.129 --> 01:10:21.466
Thereby showing how
you can jizz on a rotting cow

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:26.054
And make this fuckall a better world

01:10:26.138 --> 01:10:28.765
Just make a point with your vomit

01:10:28.849 --> 01:10:31.184
Make a point with unbridled mayhem

01:10:31.268 --> 01:10:35.605
When you make a point to
teach the boys and girls

01:10:35.689 --> 01:10:38.733
That you can make a point
by eating the puke chunks

01:10:38.817 --> 01:10:41.194
And make a point by cannibalizing ears

01:10:41.278 --> 01:10:46.157
Make a point and make
this fuckall a better world

01:10:46.825 --> 01:10:48.618
Gargle a glop of snot

01:10:48.702 --> 01:10:51.704
Then swallow it, metaphorically

01:10:51.789 --> 01:10:56.125
Fondle a donkey's cock
while felching it, allegorically

01:10:56.210 --> 01:11:01.089
Beat off into
a Christmas stocking, mockingly

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:05.802
And make this fuckall a better world

01:11:05.886 --> 01:11:11.808
Make a point and make
this fuckall a better world

01:11:12.305 --> 01:11:18.483
