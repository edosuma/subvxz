about 120 clients a year.

45:24.500 --> 45:26.666

45:26.750 --> 45:28.416
So that's...

45:30.916 --> 45:33.666

every one of them in the eye

45:33.750 --> 45:35.708
to see if I can find the good in 'em,

45:35.791 --> 45:37.791

45:41.416 --> 45:43.625
"benefit of the doubt" POs,

45:43.708 --> 45:45.791
but by not putting out
an arrest warrant straightaway,

45:45.875 --> 45:47.791
you exponentially increased the risk

45:47.875 --> 45:50.416
of these boys being hurt or killed.

45:50.500 --> 45:53.750

least of all his boys.

a lot of these boxes.

no health care, no pension.

46:52.375 --> 46:54.083

1:01:21.750 --> 1:01:23.666
Our car broke down.

1:01:23.750 --> 1:01:26.625
So you were fixing to take mine?

1:01:27.666 --> 1:01:29.583
Not trying to hurt anybody.

1:01:31.083 --> 1:01:33.333

1:01:35.750 --> 1:01:37.166
Yeah.

1:01:38.416 --> 1:01:40.041
So there's that.

1:01:41.083 --> 1:01:42.666
Were you in the military?

1:01:44.500 --> 1:01:46.416
Not the one you're talking about.

1:01:47.416 --> 1:01:49.791
I did ten tours.

1:01:49.875 --> 1:01:53.541
Yeah? Whose side were you on?

1:01:53.625 --> 1:01:56.541
Side that gave me a Bronze Star.

1:01:57.583 --> 1:02:00.833
Yeah, well, you can put
whiskers on a snake

1:02:00.916 --> 1:02:02.833

1:02:02.916 --> 1:02:04.958
Don't mean it ain't gonna bite.

1:02:06.041 --> 1:02:09.375
I could just leave, go ahead
and walk to the next town.

1:02:09.458 --> 1:02:11.750
You could've done that,

1:02:11.833 --> 1:02:14.083
but you chose to come in here,

1:02:14.166 --> 1:02:15.958
onto my property.

1:02:16.041 --> 1:02:17.958
And that's a hell of a mistake

1:02:18.041 --> 1:02:21.583
when you've got a $10,000
reward on your head.

1:02:21.666 --> 1:02:23.083

at the table there,

can come out of this on top.

1:36:27.875 --> 1:36:29.416
What?

1:36:29.500 --> 1:36:31.583
I'm Special Agent Shepard West.

1:36:31.666 --> 1:36:33.125
It's nice to meet you, sir.

1:36:33.208 --> 1:36:35.083
Nice to meet you, too.

1:36:35.166 --> 1:36:37.166
-What do you want?
-I just want you to know

1:36:37.250 --> 1:36:39.291
that I'm here to try to help you

1:36:39.375 --> 1:36:42.916
and get this situation resolved
as peacefully as possible.

1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:44.500
Now, there's no media here.

1:36:44.583 --> 1:36:46.083
It's not looking too peaceful

1:36:46.166 --> 1:36:47.708
pointing all that hardware at my boy.

1:36:47.791 --> 1:36:50.083
So how about you take a look
at that first?

1:36:51.083 --> 1:36:53.750
Okay, I'll do that.

1:36:54.791 --> 1:36:57.041
Everybody, guns down!

1:36:57.125 --> 1:36:59.083
-I said stand down! Weapons down!
-Weapons down.

1:36:59.166 --> 1:37:00.916
It's okay.

1:37:01.000 --> 1:37:02.916
SHEP:
I'm sorry about that, Malik,

1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:05.791
but I'm gonna need you
to do the same thing for me.

1:37:05.875 --> 1:37:07.583
If you could surrender your weapon and...

1:37:07.666 --> 1:37:08.791
MALIK:
Hey, hey, hey.

1:37:08.875 --> 1:37:10.958
You try and insult my intelligence again,

1:37:11.041 --> 1:37:12.875
I'm gonna do something real fucking stupid

1:37:12.958 --> 1:37:14.625
in your direction, you understand me?

1:37:14.708 --> 1:37:18.208
Trust me, I just don't want
anyone to get hurt.

1:37:18.291 --> 1:37:20.416
Why the fuck should I trust you, huh?

1:37:20.500 --> 1:37:21.833
We're done.

1:37:21.916 --> 1:37:23.208
Okay, who do you trust?

1:37:23.291 --> 1:37:24.583
Do you trust your PO?

1:37:24.666 --> 1:37:26.625
My... What, Hattie?

1:37:26.708 --> 1:37:28.208
Yeah. She's standing by.

1:37:28.291 --> 1:37:30.791
Well, then, asshole, put her on.

1:37:30.875 --> 1:37:32.875
Okay, I'm gonna do that now.

1:37:41.708 --> 1:37:43.208
Malik?

1:37:43.291 --> 1:37:44.875
MALIK:
Oh, Hattie.

1:37:44.958 --> 1:37:46.833
Came all this way for me, huh?

1:37:48.916 --> 1:37:50.708
I fucked up, Hattie.

1:37:51.750 --> 1:37:54.208
I dug myself in pretty deep.

1:37:54.291 --> 1:37:56.500
I, uh...

1:37:56.583 --> 1:37:58.500
I can see that.

1:37:58.583 --> 1:38:00.458
But there's still a way out.

1:38:02.083 --> 1:38:04.166
Ah, not for me.

1:38:04.250 --> 1:38:06.583
-I deserve what's coming.
-I have to disagree with you.

1:38:06.666 --> 1:38:10.916
Your mind has played
a horrible trick on you, Malik,

1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:13.250
and everybody's gonna take that
into account, okay?

1:38:13.333 --> 1:38:15.541
Everybody's gonna take that into account.

1:38:15.625 --> 1:38:18.250
See, there are some things
going on in your head

1:38:18.333 --> 1:38:20.458
that you're not in control of.

1:38:21.458 --> 1:38:24.833
But, Malik, your boys need you
now more than ever, okay?

1:38:24.916 --> 1:38:26.875
If we do this thing right...

1:38:26.958 --> 1:38:28.833
Listen to me.

1:38:28.916 --> 1:38:30.583
If we do this thing right,

1:38:30.666 --> 1:38:33.250
you will always be a hero to your sons.

1:38:33.333 --> 1:38:35.208
-OFFICER: Move in, move in.
-No! No!

1:38:35.291 --> 1:38:37.250
-Go, go!
-

1:38:38.375 --> 1:38:39.750
You trying to fuck me, Hattie?

1:38:39.833 --> 1:38:42.291
-No, Malik...
-Huh? You trying to fuck me?!

1:38:44.208 --> 1:38:45.916
You're trying to fuck me.

1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:47.583
OFFICER:
Hold your positions!

1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:09.791
SHEP: Malik! Let Jay out of
the car so we can resolve this.

1:39:11.583 --> 1:39:13.750
You've got one more minute.

1:39:13.833 --> 1:39:15.875
Hey, Jay.

1:39:15.958 --> 1:39:18.750
Thank you for coming out here
to take care of me.

1:39:18.833 --> 1:39:21.333
You did a good job, okay?

1:39:21.416 --> 1:39:22.833
You did great.

1:39:25.125 --> 1:39:27.083
I need you to run off now.

1:39:27.166 --> 1:39:28.916
Hmm.

1:39:30.625 --> 1:39:32.250
Get out of the car.

1:39:33.541 --> 1:39:35.958
Get out of the car!

1:39:36.041 --> 1:39:38.333
I'm not going without you.

1:39:38.416 --> 1:39:40.416
Families take care of each other.

1:39:45.875 --> 1:39:47.833
I didn't take care of you.

1:39:53.416 --> 1:39:55.166
I put you in danger.

1:39:59.041 --> 1:40:00.875
You put your trust in me.

1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:04.333
And I lied to you.

1:40:06.083 --> 1:40:08.250
Look where I got us to.

1:40:12.125 --> 1:40:14.625
And it weren't you
that did those bad things.

1:40:18.375 --> 1:40:20.375
It was the demons inside of you.

1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:24.000
But you're a hero to me, Dad.
