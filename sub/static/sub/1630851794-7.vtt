04:35.743 --> 04:38.410
So the baby could come
pretty much any time
right now.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.279
She's going to anchorage.

04:40.281 --> 04:43.448
And then if it happens,
she goes into labor,
I'm gonna fly there.

04:43.450 --> 04:47.586
<i>  I'm already nervous</i>
<i>  enough. The money we owe</i>
<i>  plus the baby on the way.</i>

04:47.588 --> 04:51.590
To make things even
more complicated,
you don't give birth in nome.

04:51.592 --> 04:54.893
It's too small.
You fly to anchorage
and you do it there,

04:54.895 --> 04:56.962
<i>  so that's what</i>
<i>  my girlfriend's doing</i>
<i>  right now.</i>

04:56.964 --> 04:58.997
I'll keep mining
for a little longer,

04:58.999 --> 05:00.932
and I'll join her
in a week or two.

05:00.934 --> 05:03.535
Don't worry about
the operation.
It'll run smooth.

05:03.537 --> 05:04.503
Just worry about brie
and the baby.

05:04.505 --> 05:07.105
Yeah, I'm gonna worry
about brie and the baby,

05:07.107 --> 05:09.274
but, you know, I also
have my other children
I gotta take care of.

05:10.944 --> 05:13.312
-We'll be sad when you go,
captain kris, but, uh...
-[andy kelly] no, we won't.

05:13.314 --> 05:16.248
...I'm pretty sure
the, uh, operation
will prevail.

05:16.250 --> 05:19.017
-Everything will work great.
-[brad] yeah, everything
will be fine.

05:19.019 --> 05:23.622
The plan is, when I leave,
my dad and brother will run
things when I'm gone.

05:23.624 --> 05:25.957
<i>  As nervous as I am</i>
<i>  about becoming a new father,</i>

05:25.959 --> 05:27.826
I'm even more nervous
about leaving my dad

05:27.828 --> 05:30.696
and brother in charge
of my operation.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.731
[brad] anyway, well, I'm glad
you're having a baby.

05:32.733 --> 05:34.733
Get you a car seat
and you and brie
can drive around--

05:34.735 --> 05:36.868
-[andy] a minivan.
-Oh, minivans.

05:36.870 --> 05:37.569
-[brie laughs]
-classic. I love them.

05:37.571 --> 05:38.503
Oh, yeah.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.706
You know what?
We're not buying a minivan.

05:40.708 --> 05:44.710
Basically, I envision
everything collapsing
without me here.

05:44.712 --> 05:47.012
So, in the meantime,
I need to get as much
gold as I can

05:47.014 --> 05:49.214
before I have to get
on that plane.

05:50.317 --> 05:51.783
-[chuckles]
-we don't need a minivan.

05:52.252 --> 05:54.753
You would look sexy
in a minivan. I might
even buy it for you myself.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.455
-We don't need
a [bleep] minivan.
-[andy] oh, yeah.

05:56.457 --> 05:58.990
[brad] you need a minivan.

05:58.992 --> 06:01.360
<i> -[andy] yup.</i>
<i> -[kris] okay, we're done.</i>

<i>  by placing</i>
<i>  all his chips on the hunt</i>
<i>  for a fabled jackpot.</i>

06:33.127 --> 06:37.129
We've been following gold
from the south here,
working our way north.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.066
We just haven't
hit that big slab,

06:41.068 --> 06:43.301
that big pile,
that we need yet.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.971
And it's
right here somewhere.

06:47.975 --> 06:50.308
Last time out, I thought
the season was over.

06:51.512 --> 06:52.944
See that?

06:52.946 --> 06:56.114
<i>  There was so much</i>
<i>  heavy snow on the ice,</i>
<i>  it was flooding us out.</i>

06:56.984 --> 07:00.185
<i>  So I went and got a dozer</i>
<i>  and cleared it all out.</i>

07:03.590 --> 07:05.957
-[joe] I'm excited...
-[shawn] oh, yeah.

07:05.959 --> 07:07.659
-...To head down there
and see what's down there.
-Yeah.

07:07.661 --> 07:11.430
It took time,
but I'm willing to gamble...

07:11.432 --> 07:14.599
<i>  That the trail</i>
<i>  of the ancient riverbed's</i>
<i>  gonna lead to that jackpot,</i>

07:14.601 --> 07:18.103
<i>  and that's right</i>
<i>  under our feet.</i>

07:18.105 --> 07:22.674
<i>  If not, all that work</i>
<i>  was for nothing,</i>
<i>  and I'm in big trouble.</i>

07:22.676 --> 07:27.045
I still need nearly
70 ounces to pay
all the bills this winter.

07:28.849 --> 07:31.416
The season's coming
to an end.

07:31.418 --> 07:33.351
It's time to make
some money right now.

07:37.825 --> 07:38.957
<i> [over radio] guys got</i>
<i>  me up there?</i>

07:38.959 --> 07:41.126
[joe over radio]
<i>  loud and clear.</i>

07:43.397 --> 07:45.197
<i> [shawn] yeah,</i>
<i>  the light's amazing.</i>

07:47.868 --> 07:50.268
What kind of bottom are you
seeing down there?

07:51.538 --> 07:54.406
<i> [shawn] there's a little</i>
<i>  bit of sand.</i>

07:54.408 --> 07:58.176
<i>  And there's some very</i>
<i>  interesting-looking ground.</i>

08:00.047 --> 08:01.446
All right,
sounds pretty good.

08:03.317 --> 08:06.384
[shawn speaking]

08:21.635 --> 08:23.401
[joe] hopefully we'll make
some money today.

08:23.403 --> 08:25.971
We need it.
Season's coming to an end.

08:26.874 --> 08:29.241
[shawn speaking]

08:31.979 --> 08:33.311
<i> [narrator] two miles east...</i>

08:40.420 --> 08:42.120
[zeke] I know
we'll find some gold.

08:42.723 --> 08:44.356
I can feel it, dude.

<i>  ...Zeke tenhoff</i>
<i> is altering his game theory...</i>

08:50.664 --> 08:52.697
Well, so the kellys
are right over there.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.766
I believe we can be
pretty confident

08:54.768 --> 08:57.469
-that there's not gonna be
any gold in that area.
-[scoffs]

Kellys are right there, so...

09:09.383 --> 09:12.017
I just kind of wanna go,
like... Go right between them.

09:13.654 --> 09:17.022
<i>  We started out close to town</i>
<i>  at that west beach claim.</i>

09:17.024 --> 09:18.490
But it was a disaster.
We barely got any gold at all.

09:18.492 --> 09:21.493
So now we're moving
down to tomcod.

09:21.495 --> 09:26.097
<i> We're completely starting over</i>
<i>  with only a few weeks left</i>
<i>  in the mining season.</i>

09:26.099 --> 09:30.068
It's a huge risk,
but at this point I'm running
out of chips to play.

09:36.843 --> 09:38.376
[zeke chuckles] yeah!

09:39.780 --> 09:43.281
Well, it's nice
and smooth and flat.
We got this big flat pan.

09:43.984 --> 09:47.218
I love it. So glad
we're out here.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.996
Can you pull it
up a little?

09:57.998 --> 10:00.398
<i> [zeke] our backs</i>
<i>  are pretty much up against</i>
<i>  the wall at this point.</i>

10:00.400 --> 10:03.268
I figure I need
about eight ounces
to keep going this summer,

10:03.270 --> 10:06.271
and right now
I'm sitting at only
about three.

10:06.273 --> 10:10.709
[zeke] oh, there we go.
I think that's the bottom.
Let down more?

10:10.711 --> 10:14.179
<i>  I know there's gonna be</i>
<i>  gold around here somewhere.</i>
<i>  It is tomcod.</i>

10:14.648 --> 10:15.880
We gotta hit it
on our first hole.

10:15.882 --> 10:18.350
We don't have any time
to waste out here.

10:21.722 --> 10:23.622
[gabe tenhoff] you generally
find gold where, like,

10:23.624 --> 10:26.057
certain layers
intersect with other layers.

10:26.059 --> 10:27.792
That's what
I'm gonna look for.

10:27.794 --> 10:30.095
[gabe speaking]

10:31.398 --> 10:33.098
[zeke speaking]

10:35.802 --> 10:37.402

10:37.404 --> 10:39.104
<i> [gabe] we found cobble.</i>

10:39.239 --> 10:43.041
This is dope.
I like this spot.

10:43.043 --> 10:47.145
As far as, like, our first
hole at tomcod, it meets,
like, enough of my criteria

10:47.147 --> 10:49.280
to, uh, start
the treasure hunt right here.

10:49.683 --> 10:52.183
-[zeke] it's off to the races.
-[gabe whoops]

10:56.556 --> 10:59.658
just tons of flat ice
and the thickness
is about three feet,

10:59.660 --> 11:01.960
which is great
for this late in the season.

11:02.462 --> 11:04.696
<i>  We're on a nice little</i>
<i>  patch of cobble</i>

11:04.698 --> 11:07.632
<i>  that's at about 36 feet</i>
<i>  of depth, which is...</i>

11:07.634 --> 11:09.501
<i>  It's actually kind</i>
<i>  of dangerous.</i>

11:09.503 --> 11:12.003
I could get the bends
if I'm not careful,

11:12.005 --> 11:15.073
and it's a long way
back to the surface
if something goes wrong.

11:16.877 --> 11:19.110
Ready to get on a new hole.

11:19.913 --> 11:23.314
But like I said, we gotta
start taking chances now.

11:29.423 --> 11:31.956
<i> -[zeke over radio] com check.</i>
<i> -Com check. You got me?</i>

11:31.958 --> 11:33.091
<i> [zeke] yup.</i>

11:42.436 --> 11:44.402
[zeke speaking]

11:48.608 --> 11:52.677
-seriously?
<i> -[zeke] just a tiny</i>
<i>  little island of cobble.</i>

11:52.679 --> 11:55.180
And that's what we found?
Everything else is sand?

12:04.991 --> 12:07.459
Usually when you find
cobble and sand bordering,

12:07.461 --> 12:13.965
it's like a line of cobble
that stretches for a ways,
and then sand.

12:13.967 --> 12:20.105
<i>  What we found</i>
<i>  was one tiny little island</i>
<i> of cobble in an ocean of sand.</i>

12:20.707 --> 12:22.373

12:50.871 --> 12:53.171
[kris] okay, start it up!

12:55.742 --> 12:58.309
Some days, we look like

12:58.745 --> 13:00.879
<i> [narrator] with</i>
<i>  a baby on the way...</i>

13:00.881 --> 13:02.981
[kris] we need to get
as much gold as we can today.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.916
We need to grind it out.
We need to work hard.

13:04.918 --> 13:07.352
We need to kill ourselves
to get that gold.

13:08.288 --> 13:11.289
<i>  ...Kris kelly</i>
<i>  is ready to deliver.</i>

13:12.726 --> 13:15.660
[andy] all I can do is go
down there and get
as much as I can today.

13:15.662 --> 13:18.329
-[kris] want--
-hand me that 7up over there.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.298
<i> [kris] look, I love my dad</i>
<i>  and brother.</i>

13:20.300 --> 13:22.834
<i>  When I go to anchorage,</i>
<i> they're gonna be on their own,</i>

13:22.836 --> 13:25.336
which is like
leaving two little kids
in charge of the house

13:25.338 --> 13:26.805
while you go away on vacation.

13:26.807 --> 13:29.607
Make sure you get
into those crevices
as far as you can.

13:29.609 --> 13:31.176
-'cause that's where
the concentration...
-I know.

13:31.178 --> 13:34.712
-...Of the gold
really is in those dips.
-I know.

13:34.714 --> 13:38.783
We need 25 ounces
to be in the black this winter
and right now I only have 14.

13:38.785 --> 13:40.385
Let's grind out
the good [bleep] today.

13:40.587 --> 13:43.888
<i>  It's important</i>
<i>  we stack up the gold now.</i>

13:43.890 --> 13:47.625
Andy will go down first.
I need him to get on the gold,
so I can just clean up.

13:47.627 --> 13:49.194
This is what we do.

13:51.898 --> 13:55.066
Okay. Put your light on
and go to work.

13:55.068 --> 13:57.101
Remember today,
the word of the day

13:57.103 --> 13:57.869
[andy speaking]

13:57.871 --> 13:59.170
work.

14:25.932 --> 14:27.966
How's it going down there,
andy?

14:27.968 --> 14:29.067
[andy over radio]
going good, jake.

[andy over radio]

14:43.149 --> 14:45.149
okay, tell me
when you're on gold.

14:46.152 --> 14:47.986
[andy over radio]

14:48.855 --> 14:50.388
okay. All right.

14:50.891 --> 14:51.890
[andy over radio]

15:00.734 --> 15:02.867
andy's down.
He's on gold
right off the bat.

15:02.869 --> 15:04.802
That's pretty easy,
because the nozzle's

15:04.804 --> 15:06.070
right next
to the [bleep] hole,

15:06.072 --> 15:08.006
so it's pretty hard
not to be on gold.

15:09.175 --> 15:10.375

15:17.584 --> 15:19.751
Oh, yeah. That's awesome.

15:19.753 --> 15:23.321
Boom! Andy's on great gold,
can't wait to get down there.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.357
<i>  Hopefully,</i>
<i>  we get a long day in,</i>

15:26.359 --> 15:29.193

and keep going
the rest of the week.

15:29.195 --> 15:32.030
Okay, you're doing
a great job, buddy,
keep up the good work.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.065
[andy over radio]

15:37.837 --> 15:39.404
well, if andy's happy,
I'm happy.

15:40.073 --> 15:41.973
We gotta make our money.

16:10.804 --> 16:13.071
<i> [narrator] the good news</i>
<i>  for shawn pomrenke,</i>

16:13.073 --> 16:17.241

16:41.835 --> 16:43.368
[shawn over radio]

16:50.844 --> 16:51.809
seeing all the heavies
down there that we're seeing,

16:51.811 --> 16:55.413
it tells me there's
a pile of gold somewhere.

16:55.415 --> 16:57.882
<i>  It's gonna be</i>
<i>  really concentrated</i>
<i>  and really rich.</i>

16:57.884 --> 16:59.183
<i>  It'll be good when we hit it.</i>

17:04.858 --> 17:06.157
[shawn over radio]

17:09.195 --> 17:10.395
[joe over radio] all right.

17:34.521 --> 17:36.788
[shawn coughs]

17:36.790 --> 17:39.757
really good ground.
There's definitely
some gold down there.

17:39.759 --> 17:41.225
But, I got a idea.

17:43.063 --> 17:45.096
<i>  There's no question</i>
<i>  there's gold here.</i>

17:45.498 --> 17:47.765
By the mineral deposits,

17:47.767 --> 17:50.201
there's gonna be
a motherlode here,
somewhere.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.303
<i> But, we're not finding it yet.</i>

17:52.972 --> 17:55.773
Instead of wasting days,
trying to drill holes,

17:55.775 --> 17:57.408
I got a way to find it,
right now.

18:02.482 --> 18:04.382
Got the dowsing rods out.

18:04.384 --> 18:06.651
<i>  My dad taught me</i>
<i> how to dowse when I was a kid,</i>

18:06.653 --> 18:09.954
now we just gotta find
the right spot here.

18:13.626 --> 18:17.995
Using dowsing rods,
some people say
it's science,

18:17.997 --> 18:21.933
some people say it's magic,
some people say
it's intuition.

18:21.968 --> 18:24.202
But, I'm a believer.

18:24.204 --> 18:27.205
Where're you at, gold?
Where are you at?

18:28.808 --> 18:29.440
Not here.

18:30.677 --> 18:31.642
Not here.

18:32.946 --> 18:35.913
Basically, you balance
the rods in your hands

18:35.915 --> 18:39.617
<i>  and as you walk over</i>
<i>  different types of material,</i>
<i>  including gold,</i>

18:39.619 --> 18:41.886
<i>  it'll pull them together.</i>

18:41.888 --> 18:44.789
And when they cross,
it's like x marking the spot.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.324
That's where the gold is.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.360
Where are you at?
Where are you... Ooh.

18:50.096 --> 18:51.129
Ooh.

18:51.965 --> 18:54.866
Oh, little pull, little... Oh.

18:54.868 --> 18:58.870
Oh, yep. Right...
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha.

18:58.872 --> 19:01.105
Right on,
they're pulling hard.

19:02.275 --> 19:04.976
This is the spot.
That'll work.

19:08.681 --> 19:09.814
<i>  There's gold here.</i>

19:09.816 --> 19:11.149
I'm gonna send joe
down to get it.

19:11.151 --> 19:13.384
We're gonna win big, trust me.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.156
Time to mark the spot.

20:47.947 --> 20:48.980

Some people laugh
at my technique.

20:54.921 --> 20:59.323
<i>  But, if you bet on me,</i>
<i>  you're gonna almost always</i>
<i>  come out on top.</i>

20:59.325 --> 21:01.859
They don't call me
mr. Gold for nothing.

21:01.861 --> 21:06.297

<i>  You just can't expect</i>
<i>  your first hole,</i>

<i>  on totally unfamiliar ground,</i>
<i>  to be killer.</i>

22:27.814 --> 22:30.781
The truth is,
we just don't have time,

22:30.783 --> 22:33.217
this late in the season,
for something like this
to happen.

22:34.087 --> 22:34.885
<i> [gabe] it's a treasure hunt.</i>

22:34.887 --> 22:36.387
[zeke] yeah,
love a treasure hunt.

22:36.389 --> 22:37.855
Treasure hunts are
long and arduous, sometimes.

22:37.857 --> 22:40.958
Most of the time,
it's spent
not finding treasure.

22:41.894 --> 22:44.528
All I can do is stay confident
tomcod is loaded

22:44.530 --> 22:47.932
and hope that the next hole
will be the one
that we're hoping for.

22:47.934 --> 22:51.102
But, I gotta be honest,
I'm getting really worried.

27:50.036 --> 27:51.301
Of course.

27:53.205 --> 27:54.838
It's a spark-plug, burnt.

27:54.840 --> 27:56.940
You gotta be
on zero air right now.

27:59.178 --> 28:00.344
[andy] pop your mask.

28:02.648 --> 28:04.348
What a [bleep] joke.

28:06.652 --> 28:07.818
That's it,
we're done for the day.

28:07.820 --> 28:09.920
We'll have to fix
the air compressor.

28:09.922 --> 28:12.156
<i>  Hopefully, the gold</i>
<i>  andy was on is good,</i>

28:12.158 --> 28:14.291
and it'll make up
for me not diving.

28:17.863 --> 28:19.630
Disappointed.

28:19.632 --> 28:21.965
That's it.
Kris is done diving.

28:25.971 --> 28:27.304
<i> [kris] it's always one thing</i>
<i>  or another.</i>

28:34.914 --> 28:37.047
<i> [shawn] you copy, joe?</i>

28:37.049 --> 28:38.382
<i>  How're things going</i>
<i>  down there?</i>

28:40.386 --> 28:42.352
[joe speaking]

28:55.167 --> 28:58.035
<i> [shawn] hell, yeah!</i>
<i>  Good job, joe.</i>

28:58.037 --> 28:59.703
[joe speaking]

28:59.705 --> 29:02.206
<i> [narrator] for shawn pomrenke</i>
<i>  and joe fullwood,</i>

29:02.208 --> 29:05.008
<i>  the dowsing</i>
<i>  has proven rousing.</i>

29:08.047 --> 29:09.847
How'd it go down there?

29:09.849 --> 29:13.016
Whoo! Some nice gold
down there.

29:14.386 --> 29:16.854
Nice, nice, cold gold.

29:16.856 --> 29:19.423
<i> [shawn] earlier today,</i>
<i>  it looked like we might</i>
<i>  come up empty.</i>

29:20.059 --> 29:21.658
But it's too late
in the season

29:21.660 --> 29:23.927
and we still need
too many ounces.

29:23.929 --> 29:26.029
<i>  I wasn't gonna</i>
<i>  let that happen.</i>

29:26.031 --> 29:27.231
Can't wait to weigh it out.

29:27.867 --> 29:29.299
[joe]

29:32.171 --> 29:34.138
well, it took a lot of work
to get here.

29:34.140 --> 29:34.972
Yep, a little bit.

29:34.974 --> 29:36.707
The sun's shining.

29:36.709 --> 29:39.042
The only thing brighter
than that is the gold
down there.

29:39.044 --> 29:40.811
-That's right.
-Suck it up.

29:40.813 --> 29:42.279
<i> [shawn] what a beautiful day.</i>

29:44.950 --> 29:46.383
<i> [narrator] back in town...</i>

29:51.190 --> 29:52.956
[vernon] alright, let's do it.

29:55.528 --> 29:58.262
Alright, cool. I'm happy.

29:58.264 --> 30:01.398
<i> [narrator] sometimes</i>
<i>  to the gamblers</i>
<i>  go the spoils.</i>

30:01.400 --> 30:03.066
Gold!

30:04.003 --> 30:06.570
I'm a greedy man
when it comes to great gold.

30:06.572 --> 30:09.840
I'm will to do anything
to get it.

30:09.842 --> 30:12.075
<i>  Most people wouldn't</i>
<i>  have stayed on that hole.</i>

30:12.077 --> 30:13.377
<i>  Not with the lead so close.</i>

30:13.679 --> 30:14.711
But that's okay.

30:14.713 --> 30:16.847
They can hold that
bank door open for me

30:16.849 --> 30:19.183
when I come walking in
with all my gold.

30:21.754 --> 30:23.954
Well, let's see what we got.

30:23.956 --> 30:25.155
[vernon] alright, let's go.

30:26.392 --> 30:28.091
That's two.

30:28.093 --> 30:29.159
Three.

30:29.829 --> 30:30.961
Four.

30:31.130 --> 30:32.229
Five.

30:32.932 --> 30:34.064
Six.

30:34.967 --> 30:36.133
Seven.

30:37.937 --> 30:39.403
Nine. Ten.

30:41.807 --> 30:42.940
Eleven.

30:43.976 --> 30:45.275
Twelve.

30:45.711 --> 30:46.777
Twelve and a quarter.

30:48.681 --> 30:52.382
<i> [narrator] 12.26 ounces</i>
<i>  is worth over 23 grand.</i>

30:53.619 --> 30:55.519
Alright, hey.
That's pretty good, that...

30:55.521 --> 30:58.422
Considering the time
we had on the box, uh...

30:58.424 --> 31:00.958
-Yeah. Yeah, we're cracking.
We're cracking.
-Yep.

31:00.960 --> 31:03.794
The gold train
just keeps on rolling.

31:03.796 --> 31:06.763
Sooner or later that ice
is all gonna break up.

31:06.765 --> 31:10.000
<i>  But until that happens,</i>
<i>  we'll keep on pushing.</i>

31:10.603 --> 31:13.270
200 ounces could be
within my reach.

31:13.272 --> 31:15.038
No one's gonna top me
this winter.

31:15.040 --> 31:18.976
We keep after it like this
and, uh, we're gonna make it.

31:23.215 --> 31:24.348
<i> [narrator] 10 miles west...</i>

31:31.857 --> 31:34.224
[zeke speaking]

31:37.830 --> 31:39.263
<i> [narrator] time is running out</i>
<i>  on the season.</i>

31:39.899 --> 31:42.399
Our first hole
over there was a dud.

31:42.401 --> 31:43.767
It was just a little tiny
cobble patch.

31:43.769 --> 31:46.036
Wasn't really worth running.

31:46.038 --> 31:49.072
<i> [narrator] and zeke's</i>
<i> chip stack is dangerously low.</i>

31:49.074 --> 31:51.008
<i>  If he doesn't hit</i>
<i>  pay dirt soon,</i>

31:51.010 --> 31:53.377
<i>  he may bust out of the game.</i>

31:56.715 --> 31:58.315
<i> [zeke] I made a choice.</i>

31:58.317 --> 32:00.484
Instead of hunting for scraps
on the west claim.

32:00.486 --> 32:02.653
We came all the way over
to tomcod.

32:02.655 --> 32:04.855
<i>  And, essentially,</i>
<i>  I have three weeks</i>
<i>  left this winter</i>

32:04.857 --> 32:06.523
<i>  to find enough gold</i>
<i>  to keep going.</i>

32:06.525 --> 32:09.326
And I'm already having
major concerns.

32:10.596 --> 32:14.698
We're finding some
cobble patches in this area,
it's a little shallower.

32:14.700 --> 32:17.401
Um, the... The question
on our minds, though,

32:17.403 --> 32:22.906
is if shawn already dug
these places up
with the christine rose.

32:22.908 --> 32:25.008
It's possible that
that happened.

32:28.881 --> 32:31.882
Zeke moved on down
to the tomcod.

32:31.884 --> 32:33.951
I want him to do good.

32:34.887 --> 32:36.620
It's time to check on zeke.

32:36.622 --> 32:40.958
<i>  I wanna get him on the gold</i>
<i>  as soon as possible so I can</i>
<i>  get that royalty going.</i>

32:44.830 --> 32:47.297
But my hunch,
by where these guys set up,

32:47.766 --> 32:49.266
that's not gonna happen.

32:53.806 --> 32:56.139
-[zeke] hey, shawn.
-[shawn] how's it going?

32:59.845 --> 33:02.179
[shawn] I was looking
on the gps when I pulled up,

33:02.181 --> 33:04.147
and we got cuts
all through here.

33:04.149 --> 33:04.848
-Really?
-Yeah.

33:04.850 --> 33:05.916
Mmm.

33:05.918 --> 33:07.951
We're right at the edge
of where we were.

33:07.953 --> 33:10.887
Pretty beat up
from here on in.

33:10.889 --> 33:13.690
You go, like, 80 feet
and we haven't ever dug
out there.

33:13.692 --> 33:14.925
Really?

33:14.927 --> 33:17.027
[shawn] I got the gps
in the track truck.

33:17.029 --> 33:18.228
You wanna take a look?

33:25.838 --> 33:28.038
[shawn speaking]

33:29.208 --> 33:30.407
[zeke] yeah.

33:35.881 --> 33:37.447
-So...
-Okay.

33:38.851 --> 33:41.184
[shawn speaking]

33:47.426 --> 33:49.926
shawn's been mining
in tomcod for, like, 20 years.

33:49.928 --> 33:54.398
So he can steer me away
from the places that he knows
that he's already mined out.

33:54.767 --> 33:57.100
<i>  This is a life saver.</i>

33:57.102 --> 33:59.770
My intuition tells me
that we're on the right track

33:59.772 --> 34:02.005
and that, I think,
we're gonna be able
to pull this off.

34:02.708 --> 34:03.673
Right on. Thank you, shawn.

34:03.675 --> 34:05.008
[shawn] yeah.
No problem, zeke.

34:05.010 --> 34:05.809
[zeke] you've helped me
out a lot.

34:05.811 --> 34:07.344
-Good luck, man. Yep.
-See you.

34:14.787 --> 34:16.353
Okay, I'll talk to you.
Goodbye.

34:18.390 --> 34:21.191
Weather conditions
this year...

34:21.693 --> 34:23.226
Hey, please quiet on set.

34:25.864 --> 34:27.497
Hello and welcome
to another edition

34:27.499 --> 34:30.700
of "kris kelly's secret guide
to successful mining."

34:30.702 --> 34:33.837
today, we're gonna be talking
about the weather
this ice mining season

34:33.839 --> 34:35.372
and what the hell went wrong.

34:39.645 --> 34:42.112
For some strange reason,
we got more snow

34:42.114 --> 34:44.614
than anybody can ever remember
getting here.

34:44.616 --> 34:46.183
Like, look at this crap.

34:46.819 --> 34:50.220
That's, like, 4-feet bank
of... Of snow right here.

34:50.222 --> 34:52.155
And this has been plowed
a couple times.

34:54.326 --> 34:58.361
The weight of the snow
pushed down the ice
like a dip.

34:59.598 --> 35:01.665
As soon as we cut
our dive pool,

35:01.667 --> 35:04.101
all the water
started pumping out.

35:07.406 --> 35:09.206
That is a recipe for disaster.

35:09.808 --> 35:10.707
Careful, okay.

35:10.709 --> 35:11.908
[kris] damn!

35:11.910 --> 35:14.177
One more time,
explanation for everybody.

35:14.913 --> 35:16.113
Lot of snow.

35:16.115 --> 35:17.881
Push ice down.

35:17.883 --> 35:19.950
Make water come up.

35:19.952 --> 35:21.017
Flood everything.

35:21.019 --> 35:23.053
Bad flood. Bad.

35:23.989 --> 35:25.288
What else can I say?

35:25.624 --> 35:27.390
That's it? Okay, good.

35:27.392 --> 35:29.392
Thank you very much
for watching another episode

35:29.394 --> 35:31.661
of "kris kelly's secret guide
to successful mining,"

35:31.663 --> 35:35.098
talking about what happened
this winter with the weather.

35:47.779 --> 35:50.113
[shawn] one of the hardest
winters we've ever had here.

35:50.115 --> 35:52.182
The snow load on the ice.

35:52.351 --> 35:54.017
Yep.

35:54.019 --> 35:57.087
If we didn't have that dozer,
we would have been done for.

35:59.858 --> 36:02.859
We got an onslaught
of snow dumped on us.

36:02.861 --> 36:04.761
But we figured out a way
to beat it.

36:04.763 --> 36:05.962
<i>  We got out the dozer.</i>

36:05.964 --> 36:08.198
<i> We got on unbelievable ground.</i>

36:08.634 --> 36:10.734
We couldn't get on the gold.

36:10.736 --> 36:12.836
<i>  So I busted out</i>
<i>  the dowsing rods.</i>

36:12.838 --> 36:17.874
Gold mining's about adjusting,
problem-solving,
and not giving up.

36:17.876 --> 36:20.877
Now, we're gonna reap
all the rewards.

36:20.879 --> 36:23.146
Let's see what
we got here, joe.

36:26.118 --> 36:27.184
Fifteen.

36:27.219 --> 36:28.351
Sixteen.

36:29.154 --> 36:30.320
Seventeen.

36:32.124 --> 36:34.057
Twenty-one.

36:34.059 --> 36:35.325
Twenty-two.

36:35.761 --> 36:38.695
22.45.

36:38.697 --> 36:44.267
<i> [narrator] 22.45 ounces</i>
<i>  is worth a hefty $42,000.</i>

36:45.804 --> 36:47.771
<i>  Mr. Gold has gone all in.</i>

36:47.773 --> 36:49.172
<i>  And it's paying off.</i>

36:49.841 --> 36:51.708
[shawn] I'll take
that any day.

36:51.710 --> 36:52.609
We're definitely on the trail

36:52.611 --> 36:55.178
but I don't think
this is it yet.

36:55.180 --> 36:58.181
I think there's a bigger pile
out there to be had.

36:58.417 --> 36:59.883
[joe] mmm-hmm.

36:59.885 --> 37:00.450
We'll come across it.

37:00.452 --> 37:01.918
We'll get on it.

37:01.920 --> 37:05.555
We've been hot on the trail
of this jackpot all winter.

37:05.557 --> 37:08.091
This is the best gold
we've seen yet.

37:08.093 --> 37:09.859
<i>  It's only a matter of time</i>
<i>  before we unearth</i>

37:09.861 --> 37:12.796
<i>  a massive concentration</i>
<i>  of gold down there.</i>

37:12.798 --> 37:14.097
It's gonna be a thing
of beauty.

37:14.099 --> 37:15.966
We're definitely on the trail.

37:19.871 --> 37:21.304
<i> [narrator] across town...</i>

37:24.743 --> 37:28.078
[kris] we'd be at work
right now if ken didn't need
this money.

37:28.547 --> 37:31.681
Hopefully, there's a lot
of gold in here.

37:31.683 --> 37:36.753
<i> [narrator] kris kelly</i>
<i>  is getting the scale ready</i>
<i>  for the latest gold haul.</i>

37:36.755 --> 37:37.854
You can never know
how much gold you really get

37:37.856 --> 37:40.857
until it's in a container
in your hand.

37:40.859 --> 37:41.891
<i> [narrator] but that's not</i>
<i>  the only precious thing</i>

37:41.893 --> 37:44.261
<i>  in his life about</i>
<i>  to be weighed.</i>

37:45.764 --> 37:47.864
My girlfriend went
to anchorage ahead of me

37:47.866 --> 37:49.799
just in case
she went into labor early.

37:49.835 --> 37:51.401
<i>  And guess what?</i>

37:51.403 --> 37:53.303
<i> When I was coming off the ice,</i>
<i>  she called me.</i>

37:53.305 --> 37:56.072
The baby's coming,
like, any minute.

37:56.074 --> 37:59.709
She just got there
and she's starting
to pump the thing out already.

37:59.711 --> 38:00.877
I feel bad for her.

38:00.879 --> 38:03.146
She's all by herself
right now.

38:03.148 --> 38:06.816
There's no flight
until tomorrow,
so I'm stuck here till then.

38:06.818 --> 38:07.851
<i>  It breaks my heart.</i>

38:07.853 --> 38:09.552
<i>  I really wanted to be there.</i>

38:09.554 --> 38:11.655
<i>  But this is the life</i>
<i>  of a gold miner.</i>

38:11.657 --> 38:13.623
<i>  I had to make sure</i>
<i>  we were getting gold.</i>

38:13.625 --> 38:15.058
The gold's not just for me.

38:15.060 --> 38:17.127
It's for my girlfriend
and the baby, too.

38:20.465 --> 38:22.265
This is their future now.

38:23.735 --> 38:25.969
[andy] come on, kris.
Pour it in there.
Let's see what we got.

38:25.971 --> 38:27.237
[kris] here we go.

38:30.075 --> 38:30.807
There's one.

38:30.809 --> 38:31.675
There's 1 ounce.

38:31.677 --> 38:33.109
Yeah, 1 ounce is too little.

38:33.111 --> 38:34.311
-No, you know what--
-2 ounces!

38:35.981 --> 38:36.946
4 ounces.

38:36.948 --> 38:38.281
4 ounces, andy.

38:40.052 --> 38:41.384
[kris] there's 7 ounces.

38:42.220 --> 38:43.219
9 ounces.

38:45.757 --> 38:46.756
[kris exhales]

38:46.792 --> 38:49.592
[kris] 9.17-ounces.

38:49.594 --> 38:54.064
<i> [narrator] 9.17-ounces</i>
<i>  is worth over $17,000.</i>

38:54.066 --> 38:58.234
<i>  A hefty chunk of change</i>
<i>  needed to pay off</i>
<i>  the leased equipment.</i>

38:59.805 --> 39:01.838
Pay ken off,
and then we can keep running.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.306
[cell phone ringing]

39:04.743 --> 39:06.242
[kris] oh, here we go.
Breathe.
