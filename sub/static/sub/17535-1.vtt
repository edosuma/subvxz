01:05.223 --> 01:07.555
I'm so happy you didn't
have to go to the Marines yet.

01:07.592 --> 01:10.459
Me too. But they said I have
to report in 2 weeks though.

01:10.495 --> 01:13.987
- Do you know where you're going?
- Yeah. I'm stationed in Germany.

01:14.031 --> 01:15.794
Isn't it gonna be dangerous?

01:15.833 --> 01:18.563
Yeah, well,
we gotta stop the Nazis.

01:18.603 --> 01:21.595
- I'll write to you while you're there.
- Thanks.

01:23.608 --> 01:25.872
By the way,
thanks for walking me home.

01:25.910 --> 01:29.004
Are you kidding?
You're my favorite girl.

01:31.716 --> 01:34.014
Hey, c'mon.
Let's cut through the woods.

01:37.822 --> 01:39.619
It's so dark.

01:39.657 --> 01:41.215
Come on,
it's just a shortcut.

01:41.259 --> 01:43.819
I've always been
a little scared of the woods.

01:43.861 --> 01:46.125
Really? Well, don't worry.
I'll protect you.

01:46.164 --> 01:47.995
Oh, you're so sweet.

01:48.032 --> 01:51.524
Oh gosh.

01:56.741 --> 01:59.539
- Fantastic.
- I'm tired. My feet hurt so much.

01:59.577 --> 02:02.239
- That's from all the dancing.
- We didn't stop the whole time.

02:03.581 --> 02:06.345
Well, we tried, yes, but we
couldn't stand back and watch

02:06.384 --> 02:09.181
- Danny and Jess, right?
- Yeah, we did, but then we came out

02:09.220 --> 02:11.780
- and gave them a little bit of a--
- We gave 'em a show.

02:11.823 --> 02:14.348
We gave 'em a show.
Yes. Yes we did.

02:20.465 --> 02:23.093
- What is it?
- It's--

02:24.836 --> 02:27.737
you look beautiful.

02:51.629 --> 02:53.995
- Stop it.
- Come on.

02:54.031 --> 02:56.192
I'm not ready for that.

02:56.234 --> 02:58.168
Oh, I think you are.

03:01.005 --> 03:02.768
Let's just keep walking.

03:19.957 --> 03:23.415
Come on, Irene.
What are you running away for?

03:23.461 --> 03:25.361
I ship out in 2 weeks.

03:25.396 --> 03:27.796
Irene, wait.

03:34.539 --> 03:36.131
Okay, that's enough.

03:40.411 --> 03:43.175
Stop it.

03:43.214 --> 03:44.909
I like that.

03:46.751 --> 03:48.412
I mean it.

03:50.688 --> 03:52.315
Too hard.

03:52.356 --> 03:55.348
Dougie, no.

03:55.393 --> 03:57.384
- No.
- Shut up. Shut up.

04:02.166 --> 04:04.100
You bitch!

04:09.240 --> 04:11.504
I should kill you, bitch.

04:25.323 --> 04:27.917
Thank God you're here.
Please help me.

04:29.660 --> 04:31.389
Go tell someone
to get the police.

04:31.429 --> 04:33.954
Hurry, please.

04:40.771 --> 04:42.238
Can you hear me?

04:46.377 --> 04:48.004
Are you deaf?

04:49.647 --> 04:50.841
What's wrong with you?!

05:11.168 --> 05:12.226
Why?

07:19.597 --> 07:22.031
So who do you like
in the fight this weekend?

07:22.066 --> 07:24.899
- Is there UFC this weekend?
- No.

07:24.935 --> 07:27.529
- MMA?
- Dude, it's the heavy weight championship

07:27.571 --> 07:30.540
- of the world.
- You follow boxing?

07:30.574 --> 07:32.633
I follow everything
in case you haven't noticed.

07:32.676 --> 07:34.940
- Hey, Howard.
- I don't even know who the champ is.

07:34.979 --> 07:36.844
Awesome. Well, if you ever
want to make a bet,

07:36.881 --> 07:38.746
then just let me know.
I'll help you out.

07:38.783 --> 07:40.944
Why, do you know
a bookie or something?

07:40.985 --> 07:43.078
- Yeah, my dad.
- Come on.

07:43.120 --> 07:46.089
I swear I haven't known you that long.
You could be a narc for all I know.

07:46.123 --> 07:48.751
Didn't want to get busted
by the new kid.

07:48.793 --> 07:50.385
Wait.
You're serious?

07:50.427 --> 07:52.622
Hey, Brad,

07:52.663 --> 07:54.756
you had the Celtics
last night, didn't you?

07:54.799 --> 07:57.427
Hey, can I-- can I
get that to you on Friday?

07:57.468 --> 07:59.163
No.

08:00.171 --> 08:01.297
Thursday?

08:04.809 --> 08:07.835
Fine, but don't bring me
a bag of change this time.

08:07.878 --> 08:10.438
- Thanks, Lisa.
- No shit.

08:10.481 --> 08:14.577
- Told you.
- I hate Paul Pierce.

08:14.618 --> 08:16.711
Do your parents do anything else
besides break people's legs?

08:16.754 --> 08:18.984
Yeah, my mom's
an elementary school teacher

08:19.023 --> 08:21.150
so it kind of balances stuff out.

08:21.192 --> 08:23.353
What about you?

08:23.394 --> 08:25.294
Well, my dad's not around.

08:25.329 --> 08:27.957
My mom is working
on her real estate license.

08:27.998 --> 08:30.626
Cool. So where
do you guys live then?

08:30.668 --> 08:32.863
- With my grandma.
- Nice.

08:32.903 --> 08:34.563
Yeah, it's great.

08:34.605 --> 08:35.866
Woo-hoo.

08:35.905 --> 08:38.966
Voulez-vous coucher
avec moi ce soir?

08:39.009 --> 08:40.840
Yeah, we got like
3 minutes, right?

08:40.878 --> 08:43.403
Looks like I'm getting laid 3 times.

08:43.447 --> 08:45.506
- You're such a virgin, Mark.
- Idiot.

08:45.549 --> 08:48.347
So what up? Yo, where's your
crew shirt, man? It's a practice day.

08:48.385 --> 08:51.411
Yeah, I kinda--
kinda quit.

08:51.455 --> 08:54.447
What? When? You moved here
2 months ago and you're quitting?

08:54.491 --> 08:58.120
- You bastard.
- What can I say? It sucked.

08:58.162 --> 09:00.562
Damn, man.
Now I'm all alone again.

09:00.598 --> 09:02.964
Everyone else on the team
is an arrogant prick.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.833
I know. That's one
of the many reasons that I left.

09:05.870 --> 09:08.134
Well, cherish your freedom,
you dick.

09:08.172 --> 09:10.504
I'd probably walk too
if it weren't for my dad,

09:10.541 --> 09:12.236
but what are you gonna do?

09:12.276 --> 09:13.903
- You working tonight?
- Yup.

09:13.944 --> 09:16.071
- Cool. Me too. See you guys later.
- Bye.

09:16.113 --> 09:18.377
- Later.
- I don't blame you for quitting.

09:18.415 --> 09:21.851
You know, I just never understood
the excitement of rowing a boat.

09:21.886 --> 09:23.877
Exactly.

09:23.921 --> 09:26.651
See you.

09:31.161 --> 09:34.528
- Hi. Here to see Mr. Armstrong.
- Sign here.

09:36.667 --> 09:38.658
Attention, students.

09:38.702 --> 09:42.433
There will be a mandatory fire safety
meeting this afternoon in the auditorium.

09:42.473 --> 09:44.703
So soccer. Soccer's going well?

09:44.742 --> 09:47.905
Yeah. We're doing better.
We have a big game on Tuesday.

09:47.945 --> 09:50.209
I'm sure you guys
are gonna be fine.

09:50.247 --> 09:53.239
- Hope so. Plan on it.
- That's good.

09:53.284 --> 09:55.047
Any thoughts about school yet?

09:55.085 --> 09:58.714
I'm thinking about Columbia.
I really want to be in a big city.

09:58.756 --> 10:01.418
Columbia's great,

10:01.458 --> 10:04.154
- but it's also ivy league.
- I know.

10:04.194 --> 10:06.628
Why? You think
I can't get in?

10:06.664 --> 10:08.393
No. No.

10:08.432 --> 10:12.095
I just, uh-- I want you
to pick a few safety schools,

10:12.136 --> 10:13.831
you know, as insurance.

10:13.871 --> 10:15.805
It's just not an easy one
to get into.

10:18.609 --> 10:21.043
So we'll just keep
thinking about that.

10:21.078 --> 10:23.137
- We still have some time.
- Okay.

10:23.180 --> 10:25.546
- All right.
- Thank you, Mr. Armstrong.

10:25.582 --> 10:28.710
No problem, Christy.
Make it a great day.

10:28.752 --> 10:30.652
- I always do.
- Good.

10:32.256 --> 10:34.281
- Hi.
- Hello.

10:37.094 --> 10:39.722
Mr. Lucas, you can come in now.

10:47.338 --> 10:49.067
So how are you?

10:49.106 --> 10:50.698
Pretty good.

10:52.009 --> 10:53.670
I was talking to your mother today.

10:53.711 --> 10:56.202
She said she's still worried
about your transition.

10:56.246 --> 10:57.907
- I'm fine.
- You sure?

10:57.948 --> 10:59.882
I heard the crew team
didn't go very well.

11:00.884 --> 11:02.681
According to Coach Klein,

11:02.720 --> 11:05.314
you told him that crew
was "stupid, boring

11:05.356 --> 11:08.018
and meant for kids
that suck at any other sport."

11:09.460 --> 11:10.984
Does that sound about right?

11:11.028 --> 11:13.019
Yeah, that actually
sounds about right.

11:13.063 --> 11:15.327
Well, you're entitled
to your own opinion,

11:15.366 --> 11:18.597
but quitters are usually frowned
upon by colleges, Derek.

11:18.635 --> 11:20.364
Even Columbia?

11:21.372 --> 11:22.737
Even Columbia.

11:25.275 --> 11:26.902
I had the sickest
triple-kill last night--

11:26.944 --> 11:29.276
took out 3 noobs
with a Spartan Laser.

11:29.313 --> 11:31.975
Man, I'm so bored of Halo.
I like the new Metal Gear Solid.

11:32.016 --> 11:33.984
The graphics look so real.

11:34.018 --> 11:35.747
Hey, Tobey,
do you have a 360?

11:35.786 --> 11:37.651
Yeah, but I can't play it.
Grounded.

11:37.688 --> 11:41.317
- That sucks.
- Hey, are you guys in Scouts?

11:41.358 --> 11:44.122
- You signed up for that?
- So lame.

11:44.161 --> 11:45.890
Shut up.
My mom's making me.

11:45.929 --> 11:48.227
So why are you grounded?

11:48.265 --> 11:51.393
I got in trouble
at my old school.

11:51.435 --> 11:52.697
What happened?

11:52.736 --> 11:55.000
Some kid stole my bike,

11:55.039 --> 11:56.631
so I beat him up.

11:56.673 --> 11:58.538
So you think you're tough?

11:59.543 --> 12:00.737
Tougher than you.

12:00.778 --> 12:03.611
Okay. Then why don't you
take the shortcut?

12:03.647 --> 12:05.512
Oh yeah.

12:05.549 --> 12:07.414
What shortcut?

12:07.451 --> 12:09.783
We'll show you.

12:09.820 --> 12:11.685
Okay.

12:12.689 --> 12:14.589
So do you know karate
or something?

12:14.625 --> 12:17.025
No. I just use baseball bats.

12:17.061 --> 12:18.585
- Yeah, right.
- It's true.

12:18.629 --> 12:21.530
One thing though: You can't let
anyone see you cross the fence.

12:21.565 --> 12:23.726
- Why?
- It's an automatic detention.

12:32.876 --> 12:34.776
This is it.

12:38.615 --> 12:40.276
Does anybody ever use it?

12:40.317 --> 12:42.251
Sure.

12:42.286 --> 12:43.753
Most kids are too chicken though.

12:43.787 --> 12:46.551
It's just a stupid path
through the woods.

12:46.590 --> 12:48.990
Have you guys
taken it before?

12:49.026 --> 12:51.722
- Y-yeah.
- Sure.

12:51.762 --> 12:53.457
Where does it go?

12:53.497 --> 12:55.124
Right to your neighborhood.

12:55.165 --> 12:56.757
Way faster than walking around.

12:56.800 --> 12:58.734
Just go for it.

13:04.074 --> 13:06.065
See you later.

13:09.146 --> 13:11.080
See you later, tough guy.

13:18.489 --> 13:21.390
Hey. Didn't Brian Whitley's
sister die out there?

13:21.425 --> 13:23.859
I'll bet you the crazy
old man got her.

15:19.376 --> 15:20.968
Do you like blood, boy?

15:25.182 --> 15:26.513
Do you?!

15:31.688 --> 15:33.713
Do you like blood, boy?!

15:36.026 --> 15:37.891
Huh, boy?! Huh?!

15:41.231 --> 15:43.290
Do ya?

15:43.333 --> 15:45.801
Next time it's your blood!

15:59.916 --> 16:02.783
It is not at all uncommon
for a boy his age

16:02.819 --> 16:06.050
to get into a little trouble
from time to time.

16:06.089 --> 16:08.421
I did my fair share
of hell-raising.

16:08.458 --> 16:11.950
Normally, I would agree
with you Mr. Hartley,

16:11.995 --> 16:15.260
but there have been several reports
from his teachers

16:15.299 --> 16:18.063
and other children
about his violent outbursts.

16:18.101 --> 16:20.695
And after this last incident

16:20.737 --> 16:23.763
in which he struck
a young boy in the face,

16:23.807 --> 16:26.105
he was brought to my office

16:26.143 --> 16:28.611
where he expressed
some disturbing thoughts.

16:28.645 --> 16:31.876
Isn't everyone overreacting?
He's just an 8-year-old boy.

16:31.915 --> 16:34.008
Thank you, Mrs. Hartley.

16:34.051 --> 16:35.882
So what would you
have us do?

16:37.587 --> 16:40.920
Unfortunately, what you do
about his condition

16:40.957 --> 16:42.822
is no longer my concern.

16:42.859 --> 16:46.056
My attention is focused
on the well-being of my schools.

16:48.699 --> 16:50.929
You've got a lot of nerve
saying that to me.

16:50.967 --> 16:55.768
Sir, while your family's history
in the area is greatly is appreciated,

16:55.806 --> 16:58.536
I must tell you that Benjamin

16:58.575 --> 17:01.271
is no longer welcome
in our classrooms.

17:01.311 --> 17:03.541
Excuse me?

17:03.580 --> 17:05.548
I'm sorry,
but he can't stay.

17:05.582 --> 17:07.573
Are you out of your mind?

17:07.617 --> 17:09.949
You expect him
to have no education?

17:09.986 --> 17:11.851
He's a smart boy.
He'll behave.

17:11.887 --> 17:14.685
Sir, you're lucky enough

17:14.724 --> 17:17.090
to be able to afford some kind
of treatment that could help.

17:17.127 --> 17:20.324
He doesn't need any treatment!
He's a Hartley.

17:20.364 --> 17:22.594
There are many
fine institutions--

17:22.632 --> 17:24.223
Institution?!

17:24.267 --> 17:25.996
You son-of-a-bitch!

17:26.036 --> 17:29.972
That damn school
was built on my family's land!

17:30.006 --> 17:32.998
You're trying to tell me
that one of my boys can't go there?!

17:33.043 --> 17:34.408
I think I should be going.

17:34.444 --> 17:36.810
Damn right you should be going.
Get the hell out of my house!

17:36.847 --> 17:39.645
Mr. Hartley, please consider
the well-being of your family.

17:39.683 --> 17:42.675
- Get out!
- Sir, I truly believe your son is deranged.

17:55.132 --> 17:57.396
You'd better stay the hell off my land!

18:01.271 --> 18:03.933
Frank, what are we gonna do?

18:03.974 --> 18:06.238
I don't know.

18:31.735 --> 18:34.932
Hey, what's up
with Christy Doyle?

18:34.971 --> 18:36.605
Christy Doyle?

18:36.940 --> 18:38.032
- Why?
- She flirted with me

18:38.074 --> 18:41.100
- in the guidance center today.
- Oh, she flirted with you, huh?

18:41.144 --> 18:43.669
Then why are you
asking me questions, mister?

18:43.713 --> 18:45.647
Well, you've known her
a lot longer than I have.

18:45.682 --> 18:47.309
Like what's she all about?
Fill me in.

18:47.350 --> 18:50.251
Derek, it's not like we hang out.
I don't know anything about the girl.

18:50.287 --> 18:52.118
Take it easy.
Just help me out.

18:52.155 --> 18:56.057
- Is she dating anybody?
- Matt Fink; fullback.

18:56.092 --> 18:57.753
They've been dating for,
like, 2 years.

18:57.794 --> 18:59.853
Really?
She's not a cheerleader, is she?

18:59.896 --> 19:02.763
- No, she's a soccer player.
- Nice.

19:02.799 --> 19:05.859
So what's wrong with their relationship?
There's gotta be something.

19:05.902 --> 19:08.962
I don't want to talk
about Christy Doyle.

19:09.005 --> 19:12.133
Come on, Lisa. 2 years?
You know it's getting stale.

19:12.175 --> 19:14.735
I don't know, man.
Sorry.

19:14.778 --> 19:16.439
- I gotta go to work.
- Okay.

19:16.480 --> 19:18.345
Thanks for the advice.
Call you later.

19:18.381 --> 19:19.473
Bye.

19:21.084 --> 19:23.575
- Tobey!
- I took the shortcut!

19:23.620 --> 19:26.111
- What shortcut?
- The dog, he killed it!

19:26.156 --> 19:28.716
Tobey, what are you talking about?
Did you do something?

19:28.758 --> 19:30.726
- No, I didn't do anything.
- Tell me what happened.

19:30.760 --> 19:32.125
These kids just
showed me this path

19:32.162 --> 19:34.494
and there was this dog
all cut up and I fell in the blood.

19:34.531 --> 19:36.226
It wasn't me.
It was the old man.

19:36.266 --> 19:38.063
He said if I went back,
I was next.

19:38.101 --> 19:41.070
- What old man?!
- I don't know who he is.

19:41.104 --> 19:43.504
You know you can
tell me the truth, right?

19:43.540 --> 19:45.531
I am.

19:50.013 --> 19:51.344
Don't tell Mom, okay?

19:51.381 --> 19:53.781
It really wasn't me this time,
I swear.

19:55.852 --> 19:57.251
Did anybody else see you?

19:59.756 --> 20:02.919
All right, come on.
I'll find out who this old man is.

20:02.959 --> 20:04.722
Where's this shortcut anyway?

20:56.046 --> 20:58.742
- Yo.
- We're freakin' slammed here, man.

20:58.782 --> 21:00.682
Where are you?

21:00.717 --> 21:02.878
We're--

21:02.919 --> 21:05.387
- Hello?
- Come on, man. We're slam--

21:05.422 --> 21:06.946
I've got really crappy
reception here.

21:06.990 --> 21:10.153
We're short-staffed. You aren't here,
I'm gonna beat off in your apron.

21:10.193 --> 21:12.923
I'll be there in like 5 minutes.

21:12.963 --> 21:14.794
All right.

21:33.416 --> 21:35.179
- Hey, Derek.
- Hey, Julie.

21:35.218 --> 21:37.448
Hey, you're here. Good.

21:37.487 --> 21:40.251
- Yeah, sorry I'm late.
- No, it's great. It's great.

21:42.058 --> 21:44.754
Man, Coach is so
pissed off at you.

21:44.794 --> 21:48.696
He told everyone what you said,
which was actually quite amusing.

21:48.732 --> 21:51.599
Really. So awesome
to be hated by people.

21:53.837 --> 21:56.101
Number 89.

21:57.107 --> 21:59.200
Are you okay, bro?

22:00.410 --> 22:02.674
I'm in the kitchen talking
to Lisa on the phone,

22:02.712 --> 22:04.339
Tobey comes in
with blood all over him.

22:04.381 --> 22:06.781
What? What happened?
Is he okay?

22:06.816 --> 22:09.410
Yeah, he's fine.
It was dog's blood.

22:09.452 --> 22:10.612
Dog's blood?

22:10.654 --> 22:13.851
Yeah, he found one
all hacked up in the woods.

22:13.890 --> 22:16.415
Some old man was in there.
He thinks that maybe he did it.

22:16.459 --> 22:18.427
Bastard scared Tobey
half to death.

22:20.230 --> 22:21.822
He took the shortcut.

22:21.865 --> 22:24.459
Yeah, how'd you know?

22:24.501 --> 22:28.631
Come on. Everyone knows about
the crazy old man on the shortcut.

22:28.672 --> 22:30.264
Bro, I've been here 2 months.

22:30.306 --> 22:31.830
Thank you.

22:31.875 --> 22:33.968
Yeah, the story
goes back a long time.

22:34.010 --> 22:36.035
The old guy's
a freakin' psycho.

22:36.079 --> 22:38.809
Everyone always said he was
connected to some missing people

22:38.848 --> 22:41.316
or murders or something,
but nothing's ever happened to him.

22:41.351 --> 22:43.182
You know all that land
near Hartley Elementary?

22:43.219 --> 22:44.379
- Yeah.
- It's his.

22:44.421 --> 22:46.048
Shit.

22:46.089 --> 22:49.115
Kids used to take the shortcut
all the time back in the day.

22:49.159 --> 22:51.423
Then he showed up
and started chasin' 'em around

22:51.461 --> 22:53.019
with shovels or some shit.

22:53.063 --> 22:55.395
I can't believe your
brother actually took it.

22:55.432 --> 22:57.423
That takes some balls, man.
I went to that school.

22:57.467 --> 22:59.435
I never once went down there.

22:59.469 --> 23:02.165
- That's 'cause you're a pussy.
- That's true.

23:03.239 --> 23:04.706
Dick.

23:04.741 --> 23:07.039
Number 90.

23:10.213 --> 23:12.340
Now watch it.
Always away from you.

23:12.382 --> 23:13.747
Okay.

23:13.783 --> 23:15.279
Dear.

23:16.519 --> 23:19.352
- Hey, Grandma.
- How was work?

23:19.389 --> 23:20.913
Not bad.
Kind of slow.

23:20.957 --> 23:23.016
Brought you some
ice cream though. Butterscotch.

23:23.059 --> 23:25.220
My favorite.
Thank you, honey.

23:25.261 --> 23:27.422
- How's the car coming, Tob'?
- Fine.

23:27.464 --> 23:29.557
He's been working at it
all afternoon.

23:29.599 --> 23:31.726
Really?
I thought Scouts was lame.

23:31.768 --> 23:33.531
I like this part.

23:33.570 --> 23:35.595
Well, easy, man.
Knife looks sharp.

23:35.638 --> 23:37.538
Enjoy.

23:42.879 --> 23:44.642
Hey, Mom.

23:44.681 --> 23:46.945
Hi.
Wait.

23:50.086 --> 23:53.852
- So I got a call today.
- Wow, that's awesome.

23:53.890 --> 23:55.881
It was from your school,
smartass.

23:55.925 --> 23:58.223
You wanna tell me why
you quit the crew team?

23:58.261 --> 24:00.593
Yeah.
It was a waste of time

24:00.630 --> 24:03.121
and I just didn't want
to do it anymore.

24:03.166 --> 24:06.294
It's not like you to quit.
It's kind of disappointing actually.

24:06.336 --> 24:10.067
It's not a big deal, Mom.
I went to like 3 or 4 practices.

24:10.106 --> 24:11.767
What exactly are you
gonna be doing then?

24:11.808 --> 24:15.244
- I have school and work.
- It's your senior year, Derek.

24:15.278 --> 24:19.305
You know, it's just crew. I'm not
the one that you need to be worried about.

24:19.349 --> 24:20.907
You should be setting
an example,

24:20.950 --> 24:22.941
especially now that
your father's not around.

24:22.986 --> 24:25.011
You mean "dead," Mom.

24:35.899 --> 24:38.390
- Hey, Tob'.
- Can I have a ride to school?

24:38.434 --> 24:40.163
Sure.

24:42.372 --> 24:43.999
Hey, come here.
Come here.

24:44.040 --> 24:47.407
How you doin'?
You still okay?

24:48.845 --> 24:51.439
- Yeah.
- Well, don't let your friends

24:51.481 --> 24:54.416
talk you into doing
anything stupid today.

24:54.450 --> 24:56.441
- Okay.
- All right.

24:57.654 --> 24:59.713
I'll pick you up after too.

24:59.756 --> 25:01.451
Did you eat your
breakfast, sweetie?

25:01.491 --> 25:03.288
Yeah, Mom.

25:04.794 --> 25:06.694
Good morning.

25:09.299 --> 25:12.496
Look, I know how important your
senior year is 'cause I've been there.

25:13.903 --> 25:17.430
Sorry it had to be this way,
but we're doing the best we can.

25:18.875 --> 25:21.844
- I love you, you know?
- I know.

25:21.878 --> 25:23.778
It just sucks.

25:36.392 --> 25:39.759
Van Gogh was
a complete loon--

25:39.796 --> 25:41.661
crazier than me,
if you can believe it.

25:41.698 --> 25:44.496
Some say
he was born that way;

25:44.534 --> 25:47.264
others believe
he was driven to madness.

25:49.038 --> 25:51.666
Man, you are super perv today.

25:52.709 --> 25:55.610
Give it up, man.
She's Fink's girl. He'll kill you.

25:57.247 --> 25:59.613
Oh dear.
I could go on and on.

25:59.649 --> 26:01.276
I got to go for it.

26:04.921 --> 26:07.446
Unlucky in love,
nobody appreciated or recognized

26:07.490 --> 26:11.153
his work during his day.
He may have only sold one painting.

26:11.194 --> 26:13.162
Yet today he's revered...

26:13.196 --> 26:15.630
Hey, do you think
I could get one of those?

26:17.467 --> 26:20.027
I'm Derek.
From Mr. Armstrong's office.

26:20.069 --> 26:23.095
Oh yeah.
The new guy, right?

26:23.139 --> 26:26.540
Now let me just zoom in here
and get you some more details.

26:26.576 --> 26:29.044
This darn thing's not working again.

26:29.078 --> 26:30.670
Not good with technology.

26:30.713 --> 26:33.705
So you ever played
Truth or Dare?

26:33.750 --> 26:37.447
Yeah, I have.

26:38.888 --> 26:40.048
Give me one.

26:42.525 --> 26:45.517
Okay. Truth.

26:47.163 --> 26:49.597
Did you really come over here
for a Twizzler?

26:51.701 --> 26:53.430
No, I did not.

26:56.572 --> 26:59.006
I think you just
earned one for honesty.

26:59.042 --> 27:00.304
All right.

27:02.011 --> 27:03.672
Amazing.

27:03.713 --> 27:05.578
Truly amazing!

27:05.615 --> 27:07.879
So I hear you might
go to Columbia, huh?

27:07.917 --> 27:09.908
I'm thinking about it, yeah.

27:09.953 --> 27:11.853
That's awesome.
Me too.

27:11.888 --> 27:14.152
I've decided to dedicate
my life to art history.

27:14.190 --> 27:16.283
- Oh really?
- Really.

27:16.326 --> 27:18.760
I'm gonna be Miss Milan's
personal assistant.

27:18.795 --> 27:22.162
- She's my new idol.
- Mine too.

27:22.198 --> 27:24.666
The lines, the color, the depth,

27:24.701 --> 27:28.262
it's very vaginal.

27:30.907 --> 27:32.602
Class dismissed.

27:39.282 --> 27:41.477
Hey.

27:43.086 --> 27:44.348
You Derek?

27:45.922 --> 27:47.981
- Yeah.
- I'm Taylor.

27:49.425 --> 27:51.416
- What's up?
- What's this shit

27:51.461 --> 27:53.986
your little crew buddy
Mark's been talking about?

27:54.030 --> 27:55.463
What do you mean?

27:55.498 --> 27:58.695
He's telling people that your brother
found a dead dog on the shortcut.

27:59.836 --> 28:02.134
You know, over by
Hartley Elementary?

28:02.171 --> 28:04.969
- Is that true?
- He did.

28:05.008 --> 28:06.475
Why?

28:07.910 --> 28:10.242
My dog's been missing
for, like, 3 days.

28:11.514 --> 28:13.175
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

28:13.216 --> 28:15.081
Did he tell you
what kind it was?

28:15.118 --> 28:17.018
No.

28:17.053 --> 28:20.250
All right.
That's all I need to know.

28:23.693 --> 28:25.718
Yo, Taylor.

28:26.763 --> 28:30.062
- Um, are you gonna check it out?
- Yeah.

28:30.099 --> 28:31.930
Let me know
when you're going.

28:31.968 --> 28:34.493
There's some guy in there
that really freaked out my brother.

28:34.537 --> 28:36.767
The old man, huh?

28:38.174 --> 28:40.540
Sure, whatever.
What's your cell?

28:42.245 --> 28:44.736
Mom, that was really good.
I can't have another bite.

28:44.781 --> 28:45.975
- I'm done.
- Thank you.

28:46.015 --> 28:48.609
- Mom?
- Here you go. Thank you.

28:48.651 --> 28:51.119
- Is there any coffee left?
- In a minute.

28:53.356 --> 28:57.019
So, Grandma, do you know
anything about a guy

28:57.060 --> 28:59.460
that lives in the woods
behind Tobey's school?

29:01.030 --> 29:02.395
Why do you ask?

29:02.432 --> 29:05.663
Just heard some kids
talking about it.

29:05.701 --> 29:08.226
You guys haven't been
going in those woods, have you?

29:08.271 --> 29:12.173
- No.
- Stay away from there, you understand?

29:12.208 --> 29:14.142
Mom, please don't scare them.

29:14.177 --> 29:16.475
That old man's been around
since I was a kid.

29:17.680 --> 29:21.047
Don't go there ever.

29:23.886 --> 29:25.751
Okay, Grandma, we won't.

29:25.788 --> 29:27.983
Mom, what is she
talking about?

29:28.024 --> 29:31.687
Tobey, why don't you go help Grandma
and then get ready for bed?

29:32.227 --> 29:34.093
Fine.

29:35.565 --> 29:36.896
Night, sweetie.

29:41.070 --> 29:43.095
A long time ago
before I was born,

29:43.139 --> 29:45.937
some kids went missing
from the old high school,

29:45.975 --> 29:47.875
kids your grandma knew.

29:47.910 --> 29:50.606
Talk was they were last seen
taking the shortcut.

29:50.646 --> 29:53.706
Police investigated for months.
They came up empty.

29:53.749 --> 29:56.877
Nobody was ever arrested.
Nobody knows what happened to this day.

29:56.919 --> 30:00.047
But everyone looked
at the Hartleys different after that.

30:01.057 --> 30:03.419
As in "Hartley Elementary"?

30:05.261 --> 30:07.388
That family's been around
for generations.

30:07.430 --> 30:09.557
The old man's the last
surviving member.

30:09.599 --> 30:12.659
I just think he's a crazy recluse,
but he's not a murderer.

30:12.702 --> 30:14.602
He just wants
to be left alone.

30:14.637 --> 30:18.630
So do what your grandma says
and stay away from him.

30:18.674 --> 30:20.265
All right.

30:21.210 --> 30:22.837
I'll get that.

30:22.879 --> 30:25.848
- You expecting someone?
- Yup, it's for me.

30:28.851 --> 30:30.614
You ready?

30:30.653 --> 30:33.213
I don't blame your brother
for being freaked.

30:33.256 --> 30:36.054
That old bastard scared the hell
out of me when I was a kid too.

30:36.092 --> 30:40.392
- But not anymore though, right?
- Nah, I ain't scared of him.

30:46.903 --> 30:48.894
So what's the plan?

30:48.938 --> 30:52.430
Well, head down the shortcut,
see what we see.

30:52.475 --> 30:55.308
Then we take a look around
the old bastard's place.

30:55.344 --> 30:57.642
Okay, let's go.

30:57.680 --> 30:59.170
All right.

31:17.300 --> 31:20.792
Hey.
Didn't I tell you to get to bed?

31:23.739 --> 31:25.400
Tobey.

31:25.441 --> 31:27.739
You're not even supposed
to be playing those.

31:27.777 --> 31:29.768
- I'm almost done.
- When I come back,

31:31.080 --> 31:33.344
you'd better be upstairs.

31:35.418 --> 31:37.477
You're friends with Matt Fink, right?

31:37.520 --> 31:38.748
Yeah, he's all right.

31:38.788 --> 31:41.018
Isn't he dating Christy Doyle?

31:41.057 --> 31:43.787
- Yeah, why?
- I-- uh, no reason.

31:43.826 --> 31:45.817
I got a class with her.

31:45.861 --> 31:48.022
This is it.
Come on.

31:51.867 --> 31:54.062
Okay, wait.

31:58.140 --> 32:00.108
Go. Go.

32:19.128 --> 32:21.653
- Is that Hartley?
- Yeah, that's him, all right.

32:21.697 --> 32:23.528
What do you want to do?

32:25.601 --> 32:27.296
- Let's go.
- All right. All right.

32:55.164 --> 32:57.198
He's coming.

33:14.016 --> 33:15.506
Yeah.

33:35.905 --> 33:37.202
What the hell was that?

33:37.239 --> 33:39.469
Hey, come here.

33:42.812 --> 33:44.746
- What's your dog's name?
- Uh, "Tammy."

33:45.748 --> 33:47.716
"Charlie."

33:47.750 --> 33:50.480
Derek, I swear to God
if he did anything to her,

33:50.519 --> 33:51.781
I'll kill him.

34:37.632 --> 34:39.726
If someone's in here,

34:39.768 --> 34:42.067
you're trespassing.

35:06.128 --> 35:07.561
What's he doing?

35:20.276 --> 35:22.267
- Oh shit, man. Run!
- Go!

35:22.311 --> 35:24.370
- Hey!
- Run!

35:28.751 --> 35:31.447
Keep runnin' or I'll
slaughter you like dogs!

35:31.487 --> 35:33.478
Go!

35:39.962 --> 35:42.055
I'm telling you he was
definitely trying to kill us.

35:42.097 --> 35:44.725
- Damn.
- What is with this guy?

35:44.767 --> 35:46.166
I don't know.

35:46.202 --> 35:48.432
- Yo.
- What's up?

35:48.471 --> 35:51.804
Ah, lovely Lisa.
Is tomorrow cool?

35:51.841 --> 35:53.672
Yeah, that's fine.

35:53.709 --> 35:56.405
Hey, I heard you guys
had a close call last night.

36:00.583 --> 36:03.643
So those dog tags I found,
they were pretty old,

36:03.686 --> 36:05.984
but one of 'em still had
a phone number that worked.

36:08.123 --> 36:11.183
- Beardsley?
- Yeah. Went missing a few years ago.

36:11.227 --> 36:13.752
- Never found him.
- Maybe the old man's

36:13.796 --> 36:15.661
- pulling a Michael Vick.
- Shut up, Mark.

36:15.698 --> 36:18.030
No, seriously.
He's probably making 'em dogfight.

36:19.535 --> 36:22.470
Don't make me tell you this twice.
Stop talking.

36:22.505 --> 36:24.302
Okay.

36:24.340 --> 36:26.535
I think we should
go out there again.

36:26.575 --> 36:28.873
I know he's killing dogs
and we've got to prove it.

36:28.911 --> 36:30.538
Yeah. When?

36:30.579 --> 36:34.208
I got practice now,
but I'll give you a call.

36:36.919 --> 36:39.080
- That boy is aggressive.
- Yeah.

36:39.121 --> 36:41.055
He's just trying to find out
what happened to his dog.

36:41.090 --> 36:42.887
No, he's just an asshole.

36:42.925 --> 36:45.689
All right.
I got practice too.

36:45.728 --> 36:47.662
- Keep me updated?
- See you.

36:47.696 --> 36:49.891
Can you guys take care of that?
Thank you.

36:51.901 --> 36:54.961
What do you say we do
a little investigation of our own?

36:55.971 --> 36:58.496
Oh, so now you want in
on the action too?

36:58.541 --> 37:01.271
What can I say?
I'm bored.

37:03.245 --> 37:05.713
So that's his front entrance.

37:05.748 --> 37:08.979
Yeah. I mean, it's the only place
that makes sense.

37:09.018 --> 37:12.852
- Sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

37:12.888 --> 37:15.186
Why don't you just
let Christy read the map then?

37:21.030 --> 37:24.363
There he is. Finally we can
get in there, scope it out.

37:27.369 --> 37:29.837
Oh damn.
He's stopping.

37:34.043 --> 37:35.601
Who is sending him mail?

37:39.348 --> 37:42.943
- Oh my God, he is so creepy.
- Yeah.

37:47.323 --> 37:49.120
So much for
the investigation.

37:49.158 --> 37:51.956
- He's backing up to his house.
- Well, there's 10 minutes of my life

37:51.994 --> 37:54.189
I'll never get back.

37:55.197 --> 37:57.722
- Are you-- you're number 25?
- Yeah, thank you.

37:57.766 --> 37:59.734
Keep it scoopy.

37:59.768 --> 38:02.032
All right, man.
I'm listening.

38:02.071 --> 38:04.938
Okay, now let's say
this whole Christy thing

38:04.974 --> 38:06.703
actually works out.

38:06.742 --> 38:09.040
There could definitely be
some runoff benefits

38:09.078 --> 38:11.239
if you convince her to bring
some of her hot friends.

38:11.280 --> 38:13.976
- You could totally hook that up.
- What are you talking about?

38:14.016 --> 38:15.916
Come on, man.
If you're gonna fool around

38:15.951 --> 38:17.976
with Christy Doyle,
I want to bang her friends.

38:18.020 --> 38:20.614
Okay, which one do you like?

38:20.656 --> 38:23.352
- Wendy Rowe.
- Mm. Yes.

38:23.392 --> 38:26.486
Man, it's her freckles.
I just want to grab her face

38:26.528 --> 38:28.325
and... you know?

38:28.364 --> 38:30.662
Need to get her in
on Operation Old Man.

38:30.699 --> 38:32.599
I'll see what I can do.

38:36.005 --> 38:37.973
Hi, uh...

38:39.642 --> 38:40.802
can I help you?

38:42.177 --> 38:43.838
I'll take a dog.

38:49.051 --> 38:50.848
A dog.

38:50.886 --> 38:52.683
Yeah.

38:52.721 --> 38:55.383
With mustard, onions.

38:55.424 --> 38:57.449
Right, of course.

38:57.493 --> 38:59.393
Um, anything else?

38:59.428 --> 39:01.225
No.

39:01.263 --> 39:03.458
That'll be $1.50, please.

39:03.499 --> 39:06.468
Yeah, just $1.50.

39:11.540 --> 39:14.566
Uh, I'll have that right up for you.

39:16.879 --> 39:18.471
Does he recognize you?

39:18.514 --> 39:21.381
I don't know.
I can't tell.

39:21.417 --> 39:22.645
Just give me the hotdog.

39:24.553 --> 39:25.611
Go.

39:30.125 --> 39:31.422
Here you go.

39:38.834 --> 39:40.859
Keep it scoopy.

39:40.903 --> 39:43.497
My God, that is not
a handsome man.

39:48.243 --> 39:50.541
Uh, hello?

39:50.579 --> 39:52.672
Hey, Christy.
What are you doing here?

39:53.882 --> 39:57.374
Uh, trying to get french fries.

39:59.521 --> 40:01.318
Of course.

40:05.094 --> 40:06.891
Do you know that guy?

40:09.698 --> 40:11.666
That's the old man
from the shortcut.

40:11.700 --> 40:13.595
Are you serious?

40:13.936 --> 40:15.130
That's him?

40:17.239 --> 40:20.675
We think he killed Taylor's dog.

40:20.709 --> 40:22.472
- Tammy?!
- Yeah.

40:27.583 --> 40:29.107
You wanna help us
spy on him?

40:29.151 --> 40:30.641
Spy?

40:31.687 --> 40:33.382
Why don't you just
call the police?

40:33.422 --> 40:35.322
That's no fun.

40:35.357 --> 40:38.053
Besides we're not 100%
sure that he did it.

40:42.698 --> 40:44.427
All right.

40:49.304 --> 40:51.795
Take my number and just, um--

40:51.840 --> 40:53.705
just text me later.

40:53.742 --> 40:56.404
On the house,
Madame Doyle.

40:56.445 --> 40:59.209
Thanks, guys.
I will text you later.

41:05.687 --> 41:07.712
Christy Doyle.

42:19.928 --> 42:20.986
Shit.

42:33.876 --> 42:35.867
Hello?

42:50.192 --> 42:52.183
Oh, come on.
Who's there?

43:10.579 --> 43:12.444
Hello?

43:17.319 --> 43:18.650
Hello?

43:20.122 --> 43:22.784
This isn't funny.

43:22.824 --> 43:24.155
Who's there?

43:26.895 --> 43:30.296
- Derek, help!
- Mark?

43:30.332 --> 43:32.266
Tell him you're sorry, Derek!

43:32.301 --> 43:35.202
Hey!
What are you doing?!

43:35.237 --> 43:37.797
- Get away from him!
- Tell him you're sorry, Derek!

43:37.839 --> 43:40.307
I'm sorry!
No, don't!

43:41.643 --> 43:43.043
Mark!

43:52.988 --> 43:54.114
Mark!

43:58.393 --> 43:59.990
Mark!

44:08.370 --> 44:10.235
Now who's the pussy?

44:10.272 --> 44:12.331
You sound just like
a little bitch, Derek.

44:12.374 --> 44:15.502
You guys are assholes.
That was not funny.

44:15.544 --> 44:17.136
You should've
seen your face, man.

44:17.179 --> 44:19.773
"Don't hurt him!
Don't hurt him!"

44:19.815 --> 44:21.646
"I'm sorry.
Let him go!"

44:21.683 --> 44:23.981
Well, you scared
the shit out of me.

44:24.019 --> 44:26.078
Seriously, though,
thanks for trying to save me anyway.

44:26.121 --> 44:28.646
Very heroic of you.

44:28.690 --> 44:32.888
- I am a heroic guy.
- You've got to admit we got you good.

44:32.928 --> 44:34.088
Yeah, you did.

44:34.296 --> 44:36.764
Don't want to hurt you

44:36.798 --> 44:39.096
Try not to mess
with your feelings

44:40.635 --> 44:44.969
It's just a matter of trust
for us, for us

44:50.345 --> 44:52.575
Don't wanna hurt you

44:52.614 --> 44:55.515
Try not to mess
with your feelings

44:55.550 --> 44:59.748
It's just a matter of trust
for us, for us

44:59.788 --> 45:01.449
For us

45:04.226 --> 45:06.524
You should come over

45:06.561 --> 45:08.791
'Cause I can tell
from your eyes

45:08.830 --> 45:12.596
Why don't you tell me
what's really on your mind?

45:12.634 --> 45:16.593
Too much confusion,
she needs a little more time

45:16.638 --> 45:20.267
So many times now
we've been through this before.

45:24.646 --> 45:26.273
So I tried to carry
the thing on my bike,

45:26.314 --> 45:28.407
you know, on the bike rack thing--
it was like 60 lbs.

45:28.450 --> 45:30.611
The box was, like, enormous.
It was huge.

45:30.652 --> 45:32.244
That's what she said.

45:32.287 --> 45:34.118
I appreciate it.

45:36.458 --> 45:39.655
Another dog owner.
They never found theirs either.

45:40.862 --> 45:42.693
Like I said: Michael Vick.

45:45.067 --> 45:47.433
- What was that?
- Nothing.

45:47.469 --> 45:50.734
So, uh, what's the plan?

45:51.740 --> 45:55.676
My uncle said that old man, he spends
every Friday night at the VFW.

45:55.710 --> 45:57.644
Wait.
He's a veteran?

45:57.679 --> 45:59.909
Right. So in case you were wondering,
he does have guns.

46:01.416 --> 46:03.316
That's perfect.
I will pick Christy up

46:03.351 --> 46:05.945
and we'll check out the VFW.
You guys go to the house.

46:05.987 --> 46:10.515
- You're gonna pick up Christy?
- Yeah, she wants in on Operation Old Man.

46:10.559 --> 46:12.493
[ Skipped item nr. 658 ]

46:12.527 --> 46:15.291
- You're not gonna be there tonight?
- Hey, what's up, Tob'?

46:15.330 --> 46:17.525
Crap.
I totally forgot.

46:17.566 --> 46:20.694
- We're working on something.
- Yeah?

46:22.871 --> 46:24.702
What?

46:24.739 --> 46:27.333
Look, I'll make it up to you.
I promise.

46:27.375 --> 46:30.902
- I'm sorry.
- My little brother Brian's racing a car too.

46:30.946 --> 46:32.538
He's gonna be
pretty tough to beat.

46:32.581 --> 46:35.744
Aren't you a little bit short
to be driving a car, man?

46:35.784 --> 46:38.184
You're gonna look like Toad
in Mario Kart.

46:38.220 --> 46:41.553
- Mario!
- I'm a gonna win.

46:41.590 --> 46:43.490
Okay, guys, just leave
him alone. Gotta go.

46:43.525 --> 46:45.516
Good luck tonight, man.
Kick Brian's ass.

46:47.529 --> 46:51.397
You gonna cry? Come on,
don't be so sensitive, buddy.

47:26.902 --> 47:30.235
Benjamin,
what did you do?

47:30.272 --> 47:32.763
Hey, Ricky!

47:32.807 --> 47:35.105
- Where are you?
- Grab him.

47:35.143 --> 47:37.043
Get him to the barn.
Hurry.

47:37.078 --> 47:38.602
Hey, Ricky!

47:44.886 --> 47:46.478
Ricky!

47:46.521 --> 47:48.045
Where are you?

47:49.824 --> 47:53.316
Hey!
What's going on?!

48:10.979 --> 48:13.277
You promised
this wouldn't happen again.

48:13.315 --> 48:15.442
Again?

48:15.483 --> 48:18.509
Don't just stand there.
Let's clean 'em up.

48:35.370 --> 48:38.737
- Watch out!
- God, you're such an idiot, Mark.

48:38.773 --> 48:40.604
- Got you a little bit.
- Not really.

48:44.045 --> 48:46.036
How far do we have
to go in there anyway?

48:46.081 --> 48:48.879
It's only a few minutes.
You've never been here before?

48:48.917 --> 48:51.681
No.
I went to St. Katherine's.

48:51.720 --> 48:53.449
We don't get peer pressure there.

48:53.488 --> 48:55.888
I'm just not a big fan of
being chased with a shovel.

48:57.259 --> 48:59.853
...fat guy that dances
during their shows in the background.

48:59.894 --> 49:01.623
Really?

49:01.663 --> 49:04.029
It sounds stupid,
but it's really funny.

49:04.065 --> 49:06.898
- That's funny.
- Well, it's not.

49:06.935 --> 49:08.903
Hey, look what I got.

49:08.937 --> 49:11.428
What's that?
Nice!

49:11.473 --> 49:13.100
Nice.
Where'd you get those?

49:13.141 --> 49:15.473
- Donna G's brother Ingo.
- Oh, okay.

49:17.812 --> 49:19.473
- Wow.
- Whoo!

49:19.514 --> 49:21.573
- Impressive.
- Here.

49:21.616 --> 49:23.846
- Your turn.
- Thank you, thank you.

49:24.285 --> 49:26.183
Cheers.

49:29.357 --> 49:31.552
There he is.

49:36.865 --> 49:38.264
- Yo.
- Mark, he's here.

49:38.300 --> 49:40.359
I'll let you know
if there's any movement.

49:40.402 --> 49:41.733
Cool.

49:43.204 --> 49:44.671
- We're all clear.
- Let's go.

49:45.974 --> 49:48.636
- All right.
- Hey!

49:49.677 --> 49:51.805
Stop.

49:53.348 --> 49:55.839
Let's go.

50:05.627 --> 50:07.652
So how long do you think
we'll be here?

50:07.696 --> 50:10.631
This isn't exactly as exciting
as you made it out to be.

50:10.665 --> 50:13.566
Come on.
The night is young.

50:14.869 --> 50:16.996
You know, you're gonna
have to do a lot more

50:17.038 --> 50:19.438
than just take me to a movie
to make up for this one.

50:19.474 --> 50:21.669
Oh really?

50:21.710 --> 50:23.701
What do you have in mind?

50:23.745 --> 50:26.236
I don't know.
Be creative.

50:28.116 --> 50:29.708
Hey, Lisa,

50:29.751 --> 50:31.685
is it weird that these woods
are making me horny?

50:31.720 --> 50:34.416
Yes, Mark, it is weird.

50:34.456 --> 50:36.219
Move your ass.
Let's go.

50:42.797 --> 50:44.924
Come on.

50:47.302 --> 50:49.793
There is no way
Tammy is still alive.

50:49.838 --> 50:51.829
Yeah.

51:17.599 --> 51:19.157
This is where the tags
used to be.

51:22.537 --> 51:24.630
- Roid rage.
- Yeah.

51:26.941 --> 51:31.878
I hate to say it, but this place
is just as freaky as I thought it'd be.

51:31.913 --> 51:34.575
- You hate to say it?
- Shut up.

51:38.386 --> 51:40.286
To hell with it.

51:40.321 --> 51:42.255
Let's go check out
the house.

51:58.506 --> 52:00.701
Can you guys believe this shit?

52:02.210 --> 52:04.440
Hey, guys.

52:09.584 --> 52:13.486
- Nine Inch Nails?
- Not so much.

52:13.521 --> 52:15.614
How about Marilyn Manson?

52:15.657 --> 52:17.648
- No?
- Not really, no.

52:17.692 --> 52:20.422
- Really?
- No.

52:20.462 --> 52:21.929
What about Shwayze?

52:21.963 --> 52:26.696
<i>I met her at a backyard
block party by the bar</i>

52:26.734 --> 52:31.637
<i>She kept looking at me
like she knew who I was</i>

52:31.673 --> 52:33.937
<i>She was buzzin' all over me</i>

52:33.975 --> 52:36.637
<i>She was buzzin'
all over me</i>

52:36.678 --> 52:40.341
<i>She was buzzin' all over me
like she fell in love.</i>

52:40.381 --> 52:41.848
I like that song.

52:41.883 --> 52:43.180
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

52:43.218 --> 52:45.812
You wanna see 'em live? I'll get tickets
for us next time they come to town.

52:45.854 --> 52:47.788
That would be awesome.
I'll hold you to that.

52:51.926 --> 52:53.484
Matt and I broke up today.

52:54.496 --> 52:56.225
What happened?

52:57.699 --> 53:00.065
We were just done.

53:01.302 --> 53:03.600
I'm sorry.

53:03.638 --> 53:05.868
Why?

53:05.907 --> 53:10.367
You know what?
I'm really glad you came.

53:10.411 --> 53:12.402
You are, huh?

53:12.447 --> 53:14.381
Yeah.

53:19.721 --> 53:23.623
Get your hand off my ass.

53:23.658 --> 53:25.125
Sorry.

53:25.159 --> 53:26.626
Okay.

53:28.830 --> 53:31.025
- Did you get it?
- Give me a second, okay?

53:31.065 --> 53:33.465
Hey, are we sure
we want to go inside?

53:33.501 --> 53:35.969
Don't be such a douche.
We came here to look around, right?

53:36.004 --> 53:38.131
That's what we're doing.
We're looking around.

53:38.172 --> 53:40.572
Okay, yeah, but now
this is like breaking in.

53:40.608 --> 53:42.906
- That's different.
- It's not breaking in.

53:42.944 --> 53:45.344
It's sneaking in.

53:49.918 --> 53:51.351
What do you see?

53:57.492 --> 53:59.392
- You all right?
- Yeah.

53:59.427 --> 54:01.691
Way to go, Lisa.
Real sneaky.

54:58.419 --> 54:59.987
Jesus.

55:00.021 --> 55:01.579
Hey, come on, let us in!

55:01.623 --> 55:03.215
Okay, I'm coming.

55:09.897 --> 55:11.194
Hey, come on.

55:14.002 --> 55:15.663
Come on.

55:15.703 --> 55:17.728
This place just keeps
getting better.

55:17.772 --> 55:19.706
This place is a dump.

55:19.741 --> 55:22.471
Yeah.
Welcome to the bachelor pad.

55:28.549 --> 55:31.177
Let's split up.
You guys go that way.

55:43.231 --> 55:46.462
- Okay, you first.
- You go first. You're the guy.

55:46.501 --> 55:49.959
- Same time?
- Go.

55:50.004 --> 55:52.564
All right.

56:17.899 --> 56:19.799
Hello?

56:23.237 --> 56:24.397
Lady?

56:41.322 --> 56:43.756
Ma'am?

56:49.864 --> 56:52.059
You killed her.

56:52.100 --> 56:54.330
Yeah.

56:55.803 --> 56:57.862
Oh, okay. Here.

56:59.907 --> 57:01.875
Oh my God.

57:04.378 --> 57:06.710
What do you think
they need a classroom for?

57:06.748 --> 57:08.477
Home-schooled, I guess?

57:10.685 --> 57:13.279
I pledge allegiance to the flag

57:13.321 --> 57:15.448
of the United States of America

57:15.490 --> 57:18.618
and to the republic
for which it stands,

57:18.659 --> 57:21.924
- one nation under God, indivisible...
- You've got to be kidding me.

57:21.963 --> 57:24.431
...with liberty and justice for all.

57:25.433 --> 57:26.798
...for all.

57:26.834 --> 57:29.803
...for all.
...for all.

58:03.538 --> 58:05.165
Oh my God.

58:16.551 --> 58:18.314
God!

58:18.352 --> 58:19.944
I hate you. Jeez.

58:19.987 --> 58:21.818
- Just kiss him.
- Get away from me.

58:21.856 --> 58:23.346
- Just a little.
- Stop. Seriously.

58:23.391 --> 58:26.417
Jeez.

58:30.264 --> 58:32.027
Hey, man, look at that.

58:35.036 --> 58:36.628
No, I'm done.

58:36.671 --> 58:38.764
Come on, man.
Don't be such a baby.

58:38.806 --> 58:40.740
Are you serious?

58:56.457 --> 58:58.254
What?

58:58.292 --> 59:00.852
Was this your plan
the entire time?

59:05.800 --> 59:07.267
That's him, right?

59:09.070 --> 59:10.901
Yeah.

59:15.643 --> 59:18.111
Oh shit.
It went straight to voicemail.

59:20.648 --> 59:23.048
Who are you calling now,
your girlfriend Lisa?

59:24.318 --> 59:26.183
Oh, come on.
You know she likes you.

59:26.220 --> 59:27.949
I can't get a hold of her.

59:30.458 --> 59:33.154
- We've got to beat him back.
- Awesome.

59:48.042 --> 59:50.374
- Did you find anything?
- No.

59:50.411 --> 59:52.276
And I don't even know
what I'm looking for.

59:52.313 --> 59:54.941
My dog. A dead body.
Anything suspicious.

59:54.982 --> 59:56.711
This whole place
is suspicious.

59:57.718 --> 59:59.276
Guys, come here.

01:00:01.255 --> 01:00:03.246
Hey, check this out.

01:00:05.393 --> 01:00:07.156
That's where the magic happens.

01:00:07.194 --> 01:00:08.889
Gross.

01:00:12.533 --> 01:00:13.932
Who's going down there?

01:00:19.407 --> 01:00:21.272
I think I'll stay here.

01:00:22.843 --> 01:00:24.640
You staying too?

01:00:24.679 --> 01:00:27.443
No. No, let's go.

01:00:31.485 --> 01:00:32.975
Good luck.

01:01:04.051 --> 01:01:07.452
God, this is some
"Silence of the Lambs" shit right here.

01:01:10.558 --> 01:01:14.358
Hey, maybe we should have
2 look-outs, you know?

01:01:14.395 --> 01:01:16.226
We don't want to
leave Lisa alone, right?

01:01:16.263 --> 01:01:18.561
No?

01:01:23.204 --> 01:01:24.933
It smells like ass.

01:01:35.816 --> 01:01:38.341
Look, man,
there's no dogs around here.

01:01:38.386 --> 01:01:40.377
- Look, are you finished?
- No, man,

01:01:40.421 --> 01:01:41.854
I don't want to--

01:01:41.889 --> 01:01:43.049
What was that?

01:01:47.361 --> 01:01:49.056
I don't know.

01:01:49.096 --> 01:01:51.462
Hey, wait.
Taylor, Taylor--

01:01:51.499 --> 01:01:53.262
we should-- are you sure
you want to go over there, man?

01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:54.858
I-- Taylor!

01:01:54.902 --> 01:01:56.631
Come on, we can still go, man.

01:01:56.670 --> 01:01:58.968
It's not too late.
Let's just turn--

01:02:01.976 --> 01:02:03.705
Come on, man,
we can still go.

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:07.313
Shit.

01:02:07.348 --> 01:02:09.873
We're not supposed
to go towards the noise.

01:02:09.917 --> 01:02:12.545
You gotta go away from the noise.

01:02:15.322 --> 01:02:18.120
- There's somebody in there.
- That's why we should go.

01:02:23.831 --> 01:02:25.890
- You ready?
- No.

01:02:46.153 --> 01:02:48.178
This is so stupid, man.

01:02:48.222 --> 01:02:49.913
This is so stupid.

01:02:57.431 --> 01:02:59.592
- Shit!
- Help me!

01:03:00.734 --> 01:03:02.167
Help me!

01:03:03.904 --> 01:03:05.769
What the hell?
Are you okay?

01:03:05.806 --> 01:03:08.331
Help me, please.
He's coming back!

01:03:08.375 --> 01:03:11.469
- Okay, we gotta call 911!
- No, there's no time!

01:03:11.512 --> 01:03:14.072
He'll be back soon, please.

01:03:15.516 --> 01:03:16.915
Hurry!

01:03:19.954 --> 01:03:21.683
Get me out of here, please!

01:03:21.722 --> 01:03:23.383
Damn it!
You have a signal?!

01:03:23.424 --> 01:03:25.984
Unlock me, please!

01:03:26.026 --> 01:03:27.960
He's coming back!

01:03:29.530 --> 01:03:32.021
The chain.

01:03:32.066 --> 01:03:33.863
Hurry!

01:03:35.903 --> 01:03:38.030
Mark, come on!
Don't just stand there.

01:03:39.874 --> 01:03:42.104
- How do I do this?
- Pull the lever!

01:03:42.143 --> 01:03:43.906
Pull the lever!

01:03:49.016 --> 01:03:51.177
Thank you! Thank you!

01:03:53.254 --> 01:03:54.278
What the fuck?

01:03:54.321 --> 01:03:56.289
Move, Derek!

01:03:56.323 --> 01:03:58.985
- Stop.
- We gotta beat him back.

01:04:00.561 --> 01:04:02.688
Sir, are you okay?

01:04:02.730 --> 01:04:04.527
- Are you hurt?
- No.

01:04:04.565 --> 01:04:06.396
No!

01:04:06.433 --> 01:04:08.458
I have to get out of here
before he comes back.

01:04:16.911 --> 01:04:19.141
Slow down, Derek!

01:04:41.035 --> 01:04:43.469
Do you think he's like
a sex slave or something?

01:04:43.504 --> 01:04:45.404
The old man's
gimping him out?

01:05:09.129 --> 01:05:12.030
Find something in there
to break the chain with.

01:05:12.066 --> 01:05:13.931
I'll get it.

01:05:13.968 --> 01:05:16.095
I'm just gonna call for help.

01:05:16.136 --> 01:05:17.865
No, don't leave!

01:05:17.905 --> 01:05:19.395
Don't worry, sir.
It's okay.

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:21.601
Let's stay and see
if we can get him loose.

01:05:21.642 --> 01:05:23.473
Okay.
I'm staying, okay?

01:05:26.146 --> 01:05:28.341
- Come on, man.
- This ought to do it.

01:05:28.382 --> 01:05:30.111
Over here.
Here.

01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:32.050
- Yeah.
- We can break it on the rock.

01:05:34.021 --> 01:05:35.818
Pull it tight.

01:05:35.856 --> 01:05:37.653
Go watch for the old man.

01:05:39.226 --> 01:05:41.751
- You ready?
- Yeah, go.

01:05:48.335 --> 01:05:49.461
Come on.
Harder.

01:05:52.172 --> 01:05:54.436
Come on, man.
Shut up! I got this!

01:05:54.475 --> 01:05:55.806
Pull it tight.

01:06:03.217 --> 01:06:05.913
- No!
- What happened?

01:06:07.688 --> 01:06:10.680
No!
Mark, I'm sorry, man!

01:06:10.724 --> 01:06:12.658
- What happened?
- It was an accident!

01:06:12.693 --> 01:06:14.820
- You hit him with a sledgehammer?
- I said it was an accident!

01:06:17.031 --> 01:06:20.797
- Mark? Get him up, get him up.
- No!

01:06:20.834 --> 01:06:23.302
Stop.
Okay, we're gonna call an ambulance.

01:06:23.337 --> 01:06:26.829
I don't have any signal.
Shit. Just watch him, okay?

01:06:30.544 --> 01:06:32.978
- Mark, I'm so sorry.
- Get off me!

01:06:34.548 --> 01:06:36.140
All you had to do was hold it!

01:06:36.183 --> 01:06:38.378
- Why the hell did you move it?!
- Shut up!

01:06:39.386 --> 01:06:43.379
Hey! Hey, it's working!

01:06:45.424 --> 01:06:47.861
No!

01:06:47.895 --> 01:06:49.726
No! Please!

01:06:53.133 --> 01:06:54.191
Mark!

01:06:56.537 --> 01:06:58.835
Why are you doing this?!

01:07:33.674 --> 01:07:35.073
Come on, guys.

01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:36.667
We gotta get out of here.

01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:40.373
- Where are they?
- Help!

01:07:40.414 --> 01:07:44.180
- W-w-what's going on?!
- Mark and Taylor are dead!

01:07:44.218 --> 01:07:45.617
What are you talking about?!

01:07:45.652 --> 01:07:48.086
Dude, just go!

01:07:48.122 --> 01:07:49.419
- Get out of here!
- Drive!

01:07:57.264 --> 01:07:59.425
Get down!

01:08:05.906 --> 01:08:08.739
Now go! Run and hide!

01:08:08.776 --> 01:08:09.834
Go!

01:08:14.281 --> 01:08:16.875
- Lisa, come on! Hurry!
- I'm coming!

01:08:28.694 --> 01:08:29.957
Christy, don't stop!
Keep running!

01:08:29.997 --> 01:08:32.830
Help!

01:08:32.866 --> 01:08:34.424
Help me!

01:09:13.874 --> 01:09:15.603
Derek?

01:09:41.502 --> 01:09:43.527
Derek?

01:09:56.016 --> 01:09:58.917
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:01.317
Come on.

01:10:05.626 --> 01:10:08.561
- Where's that damn path?
- It's right there.

01:10:22.743 --> 01:10:24.973
- We're gonna die.
- No we're not.

01:10:25.012 --> 01:10:26.309
- We're gonna die.
- Hey, shut--

01:10:48.569 --> 01:10:51.970
Where are you going?

01:10:52.005 --> 01:10:54.337
- Derek.
- Come on.

01:10:54.374 --> 01:10:56.069
Derek, don't leave me here.

01:10:56.109 --> 01:10:57.440
Up here.
Come on.

01:11:00.814 --> 01:11:01.872
Hide.
He's coming.

01:11:01.915 --> 01:11:03.439
Don't leave me!
Derek!

01:12:34.141 --> 01:12:37.508
Please.
Please.

01:12:37.544 --> 01:12:40.240
We were-- you don't
have to do this, okay?

01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:43.272
We didn't mean to find that guy.
It was just an accident, okay?

01:12:43.316 --> 01:12:45.477
We're just kids.

01:12:45.519 --> 01:12:47.953
Please, we're really sorry
about your family.

01:12:47.988 --> 01:12:51.185
Just stop.
Please.

01:12:56.897 --> 01:12:59.024
Come on.
I got you.

01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:09.168
Christy. Christy!

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:14.809
Christy!

01:13:16.650 --> 01:13:19.710
Come on.
Christy!

01:13:27.294 --> 01:13:28.693
Christy.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.592
Let her go!

01:13:36.803 --> 01:13:38.998
Let her go.
All right? Just let her go.

01:13:39.039 --> 01:13:40.472
Please.

01:13:43.209 --> 01:13:45.505
No! No!

01:13:45.545 --> 01:13:47.103
No !

01:13:54.988 --> 01:13:56.751
Derek!
Derek, look out!

01:14:05.632 --> 01:14:07.429
Do it, Derek!
Do it now!

01:14:11.471 --> 01:14:13.905
I wouldn't do that, boy.

01:14:15.675 --> 01:14:16.767
Drop it.

01:14:19.012 --> 01:14:21.412
Now.

01:14:25.018 --> 01:14:27.714
I said drop it.

01:14:27.754 --> 01:14:29.312
Now!

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:02.254
Hi, Mom.

01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:04.723
Ivor.

01:15:10.230 --> 01:15:13.256
Frank?
He's home.

01:15:20.073 --> 01:15:22.064
Look at you.

01:15:26.146 --> 01:15:29.274
- Welcome home, son.
- Thanks, Pop.

01:15:33.253 --> 01:15:34.880
Where's Benjamin?

01:15:55.942 --> 01:15:58.843
- Dad?
- He's my son.

01:15:58.879 --> 01:16:01.439
If word ever got out,
it would ruin us.

01:16:03.083 --> 01:16:04.948
No one can ever find him.

01:16:04.985 --> 01:16:06.953
You understand me?

01:16:06.987 --> 01:16:09.922
We have to be careful.
Sorry.

01:16:26.239 --> 01:16:28.173
How you doin', Benny?

01:16:33.713 --> 01:16:35.544
You know I love you.

01:16:41.421 --> 01:16:43.218
I'll always protect you.

01:16:58.705 --> 01:17:00.570
(Benjamin gurgling, grunting)

01:17:11.584 --> 01:17:13.950
I'm so sorry, Ben.

01:17:15.789 --> 01:17:18.053
I just can't do this any longer.

01:17:20.393 --> 01:17:22.861
I don't want to kill these kids.

01:17:24.431 --> 01:17:27.093
- Not anymore.
- I know.

01:17:27.133 --> 01:17:29.693
I love you.

01:17:40.780 --> 01:17:43.476
Pop should've ended this
a long time ago.

01:18:08.575 --> 01:18:11.305
- Oh God.
- Let's go, let's go.

01:18:11.344 --> 01:18:13.744
- Come on, come on.
- Oh God.

01:18:44.577 --> 01:18:46.306
Come on, come on, come on.

01:18:49.616 --> 01:18:52.210
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:18:55.722 --> 01:18:58.350
- How you doin'?
- Just slow down a little.

01:19:00.593 --> 01:19:02.754
We're almost there.

01:19:04.364 --> 01:19:05.490
I gotcha.

01:19:17.343 --> 01:19:19.868
- You all right.
- I just gotta stop for one second.

01:19:19.913 --> 01:19:22.507
Okay, let me take a look.

01:19:26.653 --> 01:19:29.952
- Is it bad?
- Yeah, it's pretty bad.

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.289
We've got to stop the bleeding.

01:19:35.328 --> 01:19:38.058
- Careful.
- We should keep going.

01:19:38.098 --> 01:19:39.656
- All right? Can you go?
- Yeah.

01:19:39.699 --> 01:19:41.428
Can you keep walking?

01:19:44.571 --> 01:19:46.630
Lisa.

01:19:49.342 --> 01:19:50.935
Lisa!

01:19:51.478 --> 01:19:53.378
Oh, no...

01:20:02.654 --> 01:20:04.589
Sorry.

01:20:12.966 --> 01:20:14.661
Grab her legs.

01:20:17.070 --> 01:20:19.265
You know, I really thought
we left this behind us.

01:20:19.305 --> 01:20:21.739
- You promised me.
- Couldn't help it.

01:20:21.774 --> 01:20:24.402
Yeah. You're just lucky
we can cover this up.

01:20:24.444 --> 01:20:27.504
Just like we did
with Dad, right?

01:20:28.982 --> 01:20:30.950
Yeah.
Just like we did with Dad.

01:20:32.418 --> 01:20:33.976
Are we gonna have
to move again?

01:20:35.855 --> 01:20:38.585
No.
Everything's gonna be just fine.
