- Ruby, we're all really proud
of you for getting the record.

20:42.175 --> 20:46.210
I made you this shirt.

20:46.279 --> 20:47.712
- Thanks.

20:47.780 --> 20:48.713
And to think that none
of this would have happened

20:48.781 --> 20:51.349
if Milo didn't hurt
his fingers.

20:51.417 --> 20:52.850

a little bit of luck.

made a difference

21:18.978 --> 21:23.281
My parents would make me throw
them away if they see them.

In my belly!
Ey-o!

21:29.956 --> 21:32.423
- How much longer
do I have to be out there?

21:32.492 --> 21:35.026
This is humiliating.
