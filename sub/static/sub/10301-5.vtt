01:18.120 --> 01:20.111
Peg, you're down here.

01:20.840 --> 01:24.389
I must've been dreaming you ran off
with that dwarf down at the bookstore...

01:25.760 --> 01:28.797
...and that I'm living in sin
with a Playmate centrefold...

01:29.000 --> 01:31.275
...and her eight roommates...

01:31.480 --> 01:34.552
...who can speak, but choose not to.

01:35.880 --> 01:38.314
Al, that is so insulting.

01:38.560 --> 01:42.030
You know, you sound as if you think
women have nothing interesting to say.

01:42.240 --> 01:45.073
That is so untrue.
Take me, for example.

01:45.280 --> 01:48.113
I have lots of interesting
observations to share.

01:48.320 --> 01:50.675
For instance,
who but me would tell you...

01:50.880 --> 01:52.472
...that your teeth have evolved...

01:52.680 --> 01:56.958
...into the same lovely shade
of yellow as your underwear?

01:58.760 --> 02:04.551
Or that you have 10 times more
hair in your nose than on your head?

02:06.040 --> 02:10.238
Or that over the years you have
shrunk several inches in height.

02:10.440 --> 02:13.034
Gee, I- I wonder where they went.

02:13.280 --> 02:15.157
There they are.

02:15.960 --> 02:17.632
Which reminds me, Al.

02:17.840 --> 02:19.876
- I want sex.
- So do I...

02:20.080 --> 02:22.833
...but I see no reason
to drag you into it.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.959
Al, there is nothing happening
in our bedroom.

02:30.160 --> 02:32.913
Well, Peg, if it's working, don't fix it.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.753
Al, this isn't normal.

02:34.960 --> 02:36.996
Everybody else has sex.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.714
Everybody else has sex.

02:39.920 --> 02:42.070
What are you doing,
looking in windows?

02:42.720 --> 02:45.029
Yes, I do.

02:45.240 --> 02:47.754
And everybody else has sex.

02:48.440 --> 02:50.396
Oh, God, I'm exhausted.

02:50.600 --> 02:53.672
Sex, sex, sex all night long.

02:55.440 --> 02:56.793
I know.

02:57.320 --> 03:01.199
I told you I saw someone
doing the wave.

03:02.480 --> 03:03.708
Coffee, Marcie?

03:03.920 --> 03:05.273
I'd offer Jefferson some...

03:05.480 --> 03:08.870
...but he doesn't need
anything to keep him going.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.952
Well, Peggy, you seem grumpy.

03:15.160 --> 03:16.752
<i>That could mean two things:</i>

03:16.960 --> 03:19.428
You're not getting any...

03:22.400 --> 03:24.960
...or even worse, you are.

03:25.160 --> 03:27.037
The big goose egg.

03:27.240 --> 03:30.312
- Again, that could mean two things.
- Oh, Marcie.

03:30.520 --> 03:32.033
I don't know what happened.

03:32.240 --> 03:34.196
Al used to be so passionate.

03:34.400 --> 03:39.076
All I had to do was undo a button,
show some skin, and he was ready.

03:39.280 --> 03:44.149
Yeah. Time was it was enough to be
naked in a car with music playing.

03:44.360 --> 03:47.591
I could get any man that walked by.

03:48.640 --> 03:52.110
Well, that is, if it was late enough.

03:52.960 --> 03:55.030
But now men need all the help
we can give them.

03:55.240 --> 03:58.755
I mean, think of men's sexual lives
like on a graph.

03:58.960 --> 04:01.997
Their prowess increases to a peak...

04:02.200 --> 04:04.077
<i>...then they hit a certain age and:</i>

04:06.280 --> 04:09.238
Look at them talking about me again.

04:10.880 --> 04:14.077
You know, it's easy to complain.
We're the ones that do all the work.

04:14.280 --> 04:17.716
Many's the time I've thought, "Oh,
I'd like to just lay there, you know...

04:17.920 --> 04:21.548
...and occasionally toss out
an, 'Oh, baby, oh, baby. "'

04:23.120 --> 04:26.635
You'd think my natural beauty would be
enough just to look at me, you know.

04:26.840 --> 04:31.072
I mean, you don't ask
the statue of David to move a little.

04:32.400 --> 04:36.837
Yep, it's a crime how men
get handsomer and women just age.

04:37.040 --> 04:41.397
Oh, and sure, I'd get excited too
if I was going to bed with me.

04:43.400 --> 04:45.914
Well, no such luck.

04:46.120 --> 04:49.078
Oh, time was I used to have
to think about baseball...

04:49.280 --> 04:50.599
...just to slow things down.

04:50.800 --> 04:54.554
Now I just wanna
think about baseball.

04:54.760 --> 04:58.150
<i>How many times can you
have sex with your hands like this:</i>

05:02.600 --> 05:05.433
Look, they're talking
about me again.

05:05.960 --> 05:07.393
But you get used to it.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.313
You know, Marcie,
that was really a wild nightgown...

05:10.520 --> 05:11.794
...you had on last night.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.274
Can I see it sometime?

05:13.520 --> 05:16.318
No. Jefferson ate it.

05:18.840 --> 05:21.798
- Oh, it was one of those edible things.
- No, but he was hungry...

05:22.000 --> 05:23.911
...and we didn't wanna stop.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.236
That's a nice button.
It goes with my zipper...

05:30.440 --> 05:33.159
...that I found in my burrito
at lllegal Pete's.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.278
God, Marcie, you just seem to have
no problem with Jefferson at all.

05:38.480 --> 05:40.994
Yeah, right. You try fighting him
for the mirror.

05:44.960 --> 05:47.872
But in the bedroom,
I know how to handle a man.

05:48.080 --> 05:49.513
You see, men are like children.

05:49.720 --> 05:52.188
They need to be amused.
They want a show.

05:52.400 --> 05:56.075
So you have to dress it up, you know?
Entice them.

05:56.280 --> 06:01.115
I know you look at me and think,
" Marcie, you're a sex goddess.

06:02.800 --> 06:04.631
Surely you need no help. "

06:05.600 --> 06:09.479
Yeah, I- I was thinking
something like that.

06:09.720 --> 06:11.039
Yes, well, brace yourself.

06:11.240 --> 06:12.798
For even one such as I...

06:13.000 --> 06:16.356
...must resort to costumes
and desperate pleading...

06:16.560 --> 06:19.313
...to have romantic, blinding sex.

06:19.520 --> 06:22.478
What you should do is go down
to Hemphley's Department Store.

06:22.680 --> 06:24.955
They have the best
lingerie department in town.

06:25.160 --> 06:28.596
- Soon Al will be all over you.
- Well, then I better stop...

06:28.800 --> 06:31.360
...and get him some soap
and a toothbrush and...

06:31.560 --> 06:34.393
Oh, and an instruction manual.

06:36.080 --> 06:37.798
Al.

06:38.320 --> 06:40.197
Honey, I wanna
go shopping with Marcie.

06:40.400 --> 06:41.879
Give me money.

06:42.080 --> 06:43.513
No.

06:43.920 --> 06:45.239
Gee, honey, that's too bad.

06:45.440 --> 06:48.477
You know, I was thinking
of getting you a nice juicy steak.

06:48.680 --> 06:50.477
Doesn't that sound good, honey?

06:53.800 --> 06:56.030
Yeah, and Peg, and those-
Those little rolls...

06:56.240 --> 06:59.198
...that when you open them up,
hot comes out.

07:00.240 --> 07:02.834
Well, Al, hot is expensive.

07:03.040 --> 07:05.076
Well, Peg, I've been
saving all my money...

07:05.280 --> 07:08.397
<i>...for the big anniversary issue
of Hooters In High Heels.</i>

07:09.360 --> 07:12.750
You know- You know, it's the issue
that deals with...

07:12.960 --> 07:14.951
...hoo- Hooters
in high heels.

07:15.160 --> 07:18.755
Well, I guess I don't have
to make you a chocolate cake.

07:18.960 --> 07:22.635
<i>Chocolate cak e, chocolate cak e
Eat so much you get a tummy ache</i>

07:24.280 --> 07:26.396
See you tonight, baby.

07:27.760 --> 07:30.638
- He really believes you.
- And why not?

07:30.840 --> 07:33.274
Marriage is a sacred trust.

07:33.480 --> 07:35.869
See you for dinner, sweetheart.

07:46.080 --> 07:49.470
You know, Jefferson,
I hope I made the right decision.

07:49.720 --> 07:50.994
Hooters.

07:51.200 --> 07:53.475
Chocolate cake. Hooters.

07:53.680 --> 07:55.352
Chocolate cake.

07:56.080 --> 07:59.834
Decisions, decisions. Well, I guess
that's all part of being an adult.

08:00.040 --> 08:01.314
- Yeah.
- Jefferson?

08:01.520 --> 08:02.839
What?

08:03.440 --> 08:05.158
Choco-hooters.

08:08.840 --> 08:11.559
You know, I think there might be
something to that.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.348
Peg.

08:17.560 --> 08:19.278
I'm home.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.509
- Hi, Daddy.
- Yeah, sure.

08:23.840 --> 08:26.479
Go away. I'm gonna eat.

08:26.680 --> 08:29.319
I don't wanna feel bad about
not giving you any.

08:29.680 --> 08:32.352
Before I go, can I ask a question?

08:32.559 --> 08:35.073
What's the difference between
men and women?

08:38.880 --> 08:40.631
One works...

08:40.919 --> 08:42.751
...and the other's a woman.

08:45.040 --> 08:48.237
So, Mrs. Darcy is a man?

08:54.440 --> 08:56.032
Yes.

09:02.520 --> 09:05.830
Then Mr. Darcy is a woman?

09:06.760 --> 09:08.239
Yes.

09:10.040 --> 09:12.429
No wonder you sell shoes.

09:13.880 --> 09:15.313
Yes.

09:18.160 --> 09:20.594
Oh, man, I'm gonna eat.

09:42.120 --> 09:46.193
Just like they were 20 years ago
when I bought them.

09:47.600 --> 09:50.558
- Al.
- It is I.

09:50.760 --> 09:53.672
- And I am ready.
- Do you want it, Al?

09:53.880 --> 09:55.711
Oh, I want it.

09:55.920 --> 10:00.198
- Do you need it, Al?
- I need it bad, baby.

10:01.480 --> 10:04.916
Supper's served.

10:19.080 --> 10:20.877
Where is it, Peg?

10:21.880 --> 10:24.155
Where is it, baby?
Don't do this to me.

10:24.360 --> 10:27.113
I'm wearing it, baby.

10:30.040 --> 10:33.032
Well, take it off and fry it up.
I'm starving.

10:37.240 --> 10:39.117
Al, it's not food.

10:39.320 --> 10:40.639
It's just me.

10:40.840 --> 10:45.630
But don't worry. I'll make you
forget all about food.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.309
Well, honey,
you've already done that.

10:53.560 --> 10:55.869
Al, can you honestly
look me in the eye...

10:56.080 --> 10:58.310
...and tell me
that this does not turn you on?

10:58.520 --> 11:02.308
Well, Peg, I can look you
in the anywhere and say that.

11:05.120 --> 11:06.599
Can't be just me.

11:06.800 --> 11:11.351
Maybe I'm wrong.
Maybe nobody has sex anymore.

11:20.600 --> 11:23.797
- Oh, God.
- Oh, Bob.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.592
Oh, Fong.

11:25.800 --> 11:28.439
Oh, mailman.

11:28.640 --> 11:30.835
Oh, God. Oh, Jefferson. Oh, God.

11:31.040 --> 11:34.191
Oh, God. Oh, Jefferson. Oh, God.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.468
You hear that, Peg?
Everybody in the neighbourhood...

11:42.680 --> 11:45.148
...but me is eating.

11:54.840 --> 11:56.592
Peg, I don't wanna be here.

11:56.800 --> 12:00.349
I don't feel comfortable
in Undergarment World.

12:00.560 --> 12:03.632
And the idea of you trying them on,
frankly, gives me the jimmies.

12:04.960 --> 12:08.635
Al, just look around and tell me
if you see something you like.

12:10.360 --> 12:12.032
Well, I like that.

12:15.480 --> 12:18.199
Al, that is exactly
what I had on earlier.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.118
No kidding?

12:20.720 --> 12:23.598
Well, what, did you have it on
backwards or something?

12:25.680 --> 12:28.433
So, what do you think, honey?

12:28.640 --> 12:30.358
Well, what difference does it make?

12:30.560 --> 12:32.437
We're married.

12:32.720 --> 12:35.837
Well, maybe if that redhead
over there was wearing it.

12:41.080 --> 12:44.914
Look, Al. Like I have pleaded with you
a thousand times in the bedroom...

12:45.120 --> 12:47.918
...just look around. I'm sure
you'll find something you like.

12:48.120 --> 12:50.634
Peg, I don't belong here.
This is not a place for men.

12:51.480 --> 12:53.630
It's not healthy.

12:54.280 --> 12:55.508
Case in point.

12:59.800 --> 13:01.870
Now, I'm not just in college.

13:02.080 --> 13:04.548
I'm in community college.

13:07.040 --> 13:09.429
I saw this movie where
this mannequin came to life...

13:09.640 --> 13:12.712
...so if you can talk, please do.

13:14.200 --> 13:15.519
Bud.

13:18.560 --> 13:20.073
Oh, my God.

13:20.280 --> 13:22.236
You know my name.

13:23.240 --> 13:24.639
Do you also know what I like?

13:24.840 --> 13:26.432
Bud.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.631
You sound like my mother.

13:34.280 --> 13:37.352
Hi, guys. I was just trying out
some of my lines...

13:37.560 --> 13:40.518
...that I use on my many
human co-ed dates.

13:42.400 --> 13:46.313
Yeah, sure. Like having you guys for
parents had nothing to do with this.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.792
Al, I think you better talk to him.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.117
Well, you have ideas
about what I should say?

13:52.320 --> 13:53.673
No.

13:56.160 --> 13:57.388
Can I help you?

13:57.600 --> 13:59.716
Not unless you can
take me back 20 years...

13:59.920 --> 14:02.878
...and tell me not to marry
a shoe salesman.

14:03.080 --> 14:05.435
Actually, I'd like to exchange
this for something...

14:05.640 --> 14:07.995
...that will definitely
interest my husband.

14:08.200 --> 14:11.272
Well, I don't know.
It would help if I saw your husband.

14:11.640 --> 14:13.517
Never does me.

14:14.040 --> 14:17.271
But brace yourself, there he is.

14:17.520 --> 14:20.796
Here's one that might come in a
little handy, somewhere down the line.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.755
I call it the Bundy
one-finger-bra-unhook.

14:34.600 --> 14:37.956
My God. It's got me.
No. Help me, Bud.

14:44.200 --> 14:46.555
Don't panic, Dad.

14:47.840 --> 14:51.753
I mean, old peculiar stranger.

14:54.040 --> 14:55.632
Help me, Bud!

14:56.880 --> 14:58.711
Help me, Bud!

15:11.520 --> 15:13.795
Does nothing please him?

15:14.680 --> 15:18.832
What does a normal woman have to do
to keep her husband interested?

15:19.080 --> 15:21.674
Not a day goes by...

15:22.560 --> 15:26.348
...that I don't try to keep him happy.

15:28.600 --> 15:32.115
God, I wish someone
would dust around here.

15:33.240 --> 15:34.832
Hi, Mom.

15:41.320 --> 15:44.232
Not that I really wanna know,
but how'd Dad like the outfit?

15:44.440 --> 15:46.351
Well, he said what he really wanted...

15:46.560 --> 15:49.597
...was the meat that used
to live under this baby.

15:50.080 --> 15:51.308
I give up.

15:51.520 --> 15:53.476
I'd better just resign myself.

15:53.680 --> 15:56.433
I'm just not attractive
to your father anymore.

15:56.640 --> 16:00.474
Although I do excite myself.

16:00.920 --> 16:02.876
But then, I was never the problem.

16:03.720 --> 16:05.438
Well, you're still attractive, Mom.

16:05.640 --> 16:08.200
Dad's just going through one
of those man phases.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.834
I mean, it's probably not
that easy for him anymore.

16:11.040 --> 16:13.759
What is he now? Seventy-five?

16:14.720 --> 16:17.109
Daddy is the same age as I am.

16:17.640 --> 16:19.835
You're 75?

16:21.640 --> 16:23.119
God, you look good.

16:24.320 --> 16:25.912
Thank you.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.073
Oh, but don't get down, Mom.

16:28.280 --> 16:30.316
Lots of guys find you attractive.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.795
Really? Like who?

16:33.000 --> 16:35.912
Well, like my friend
Buffy's grandfather.

16:36.560 --> 16:39.438
All of his other friends
were drooling over Betty White...

16:39.640 --> 16:41.039
...but he wouldn't hear of it.

16:41.240 --> 16:44.038
He said that you were better.
And he was a very wise man, Mom.

16:44.240 --> 16:46.231
He was 103.

16:46.520 --> 16:48.590
You know, till he died.

16:48.800 --> 16:53.351
In fact his last words were,
" Peggy hot, Betty not. "

16:56.840 --> 16:58.910
Gee, that's very flattering, honey.

16:59.120 --> 17:00.678
- Anyone younger?
- Nope.

17:00.880 --> 17:02.108
- You sure?
- Yep.

17:02.320 --> 17:04.231
- You don't wanna take a minute?
- Nope.

17:04.440 --> 17:07.193
Oh, my God. Then it's true.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.960
It really is Daddy and me
for the rest of our lives.

17:11.680 --> 17:15.150
I guess I have no choice
but to go back to that lingerie store...

17:15.359 --> 17:17.156
...and buy something kinky this time.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.872
Okay, if you must. But you shouldn't
work so hard with Daddy.

17:22.079 --> 17:26.198
You have to remember,
attraction is a three-way street.

17:27.800 --> 17:30.553
Or is it a one-way tunnel?

17:31.440 --> 17:33.908
In any case, I do know
that it's a four-lane highway...

17:34.120 --> 17:36.554
...and it takes two
to use the car-pool lane.

17:39.160 --> 17:42.311
What I'm trying to say is, what
the younger generation has learned...

17:42.520 --> 17:46.229
...is that there's absolutely nothing
for us to watch on CBS...

17:46.440 --> 17:49.079
...and that you have to be yourself.

17:49.280 --> 17:52.795
A man has to love you for you,
not for some costume.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.195
He has to love who you are inside.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.916
Oh, gosh.

18:03.920 --> 18:07.993
Well, I guess it's back to Hemphley's.

18:10.440 --> 18:11.873
Al.

18:12.080 --> 18:13.718
What?

18:19.320 --> 18:21.436
You can come out of there, Al.
I'm going out.

18:22.080 --> 18:24.355
But will you be back?

18:24.800 --> 18:27.189
Yes. But don't worry.

18:27.400 --> 18:30.198
I'm gonna turn this costume in
and get you food.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.755
No, you won't. It'll just
be another tight outfit...

18:32.960 --> 18:35.428
...showing your skin and scaring me.

18:36.160 --> 18:37.718
That's it now, Peg.

18:37.920 --> 18:41.117
I'm putting my foot down
as the man of this closet.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.755
- No more outfits.
- All right, Al.

18:43.960 --> 18:46.918
No more outfits.
Tomorrow I'll get you food.

18:56.920 --> 18:59.514
I knew it. No food downstairs.

18:59.720 --> 19:02.075
Doesn't bother me at all.

19:02.280 --> 19:03.952
Al not sad.

19:04.400 --> 19:07.597
Come look under the covers, baby.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.355
Now Al sad.

19:11.560 --> 19:13.551
- I'll be in my closet.
- Oh, Al.

19:13.760 --> 19:17.639
There's something under here
that might interest you.

19:17.880 --> 19:19.279
This.

19:21.800 --> 19:23.791
It's a steak, baby.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.639
Doesn't it look good?

19:27.000 --> 19:28.752
I love you.

19:30.240 --> 19:33.915
Who wants a bite
of this nice, delicious steak?

19:34.120 --> 19:35.838
I do, I do, I do.

19:36.160 --> 19:40.358
Come and get it, baby.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.514
Good boy.

19:52.640 --> 19:55.837
Is my big boy happy now?

20:01.960 --> 20:03.757
Come here, Al.

20:04.080 --> 20:05.513
No.

20:05.720 --> 20:06.948
Well, if you don't...

20:07.160 --> 20:11.312
...you're gonna miss out on this.

20:13.480 --> 20:18.270
A nice, juicy prime-rib bone.

20:25.680 --> 20:29.878
All right, baby. Time for dessert.

20:35.680 --> 20:38.558
Good boy.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.590
Daddy's home.

20:56.640 --> 20:58.358
What's for dinner, baby?

20:58.760 --> 21:00.193
Nothing, honey.

21:00.400 --> 21:01.958
Nut 'n Honey cereal?

21:03.040 --> 21:05.474
No, Al. I mean nothing, honey.

21:05.720 --> 21:08.029
Well- Well, that can't be.

21:10.480 --> 21:13.552
Well, there's nothing appetizing
under there at all.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.316
Now, Peg, if you expect me
to pleasure you...

21:16.520 --> 21:19.193
...I'm gonna need the same
thing that Robert Mitchum needs.

21:19.640 --> 21:21.995
A jowl tightening?

21:22.200 --> 21:24.919
No. Beef, baby. Lay it on me.

21:25.280 --> 21:28.113
Al, do you know
that I cooked 4 hours...

21:28.320 --> 21:31.039
...for that 5 minutes of sex we had?

21:31.240 --> 21:33.071
It's just not worth it.

21:33.400 --> 21:36.517
Well, I- Well, I- I can get better.

21:36.720 --> 21:40.030
I could probably get up
to six minutes.

21:40.240 --> 21:43.437
Oh, honey, it's not that, it's j-
It's just too much trouble.

21:43.640 --> 21:45.039
Oh, yeah?

21:45.240 --> 21:47.071
Well, look at this.

21:56.920 --> 21:59.514
That ought to be worth a pot roast.

22:00.640 --> 22:02.676
Al, it's just not worth it.

22:02.880 --> 22:05.758
- I'll be in the closet.
- I'll get another outfit.

22:05.960 --> 22:08.633
I saw a little black one,
see-through, feathers on the side.

22:08.840 --> 22:10.432
What do you say?

22:11.960 --> 22:14.155
It'll make my heinie
look like a little apple.

22:14.360 --> 22:15.918
Come on, what do you say?

22:16.305 --> 22:22.699
