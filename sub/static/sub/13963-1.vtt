WEBVTT

00:01.710 --> 00:02.961
- Holy shit.

00:02.961 --> 00:03.962
Are those her ashes?

00:03.962 --> 00:05.297
- Yep.

00:05.297 --> 00:07.049
45 years of sex and drugs
and rock and roll

00:07.049 --> 00:09.051
stuffed into one cheap,
wooden box.

00:09.051 --> 00:10.219
- Ugh.

00:10.219 --> 00:11.803
Did you find out
what happened?

00:11.803 --> 00:13.305
- Well, her sad little roommate
said she had a headache

00:13.305 --> 00:14.640
for a couple of days,

00:14.640 --> 00:16.475
but who would have thought
aneurysm, right?

00:16.475 --> 00:19.061
And then I guess
Friday morning she got up,

00:19.061 --> 00:21.438
had a sip of coffee,
and just collapsed.

00:21.438 --> 00:22.856
- Hey, you got to go,
that's the way you do it,

00:22.856 --> 00:24.274
quick and easy.

00:24.274 --> 00:26.610
- Yeah, harder for everyone
you leave behind, though.

00:26.610 --> 00:27.861
Not the best Micki picture.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.571
- Mm.
How was the service?

00:29.571 --> 00:30.614
- Brutal.
- Awful.

00:30.614 --> 00:32.032
- So sad.
- Great light, though.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.575
Got some great pictures
you got to see.

00:33.575 --> 00:35.369
Look at how the light's coming
through the window,

00:35.369 --> 00:36.745
giving me that Godfather-y
effect on those empty pews.

00:36.745 --> 00:38.121
- Oh, wow.
- You're doing good, man.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.540
- 15 lousy people
in that church.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.124
20 if you count the chicks
in the band.

00:41.124 --> 00:42.209
- There was a band?

00:42.209 --> 00:43.544
- Les Zeppelin.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.754
All-girl Zeppelin
tribute band.

00:45.754 --> 00:47.422
Micki loved 'em.

00:47.422 --> 00:49.007
- They played one of our Heathen
songs, "Ain't No Valentine,"

00:49.007 --> 00:50.384
which was basically
Micki's theme song

00:50.384 --> 00:52.261
about never getting married
or having kids,

00:52.261 --> 00:54.096
which she accomplished.

00:54.096 --> 00:55.347
- Yeah, and then they played
her favorite Zepp song,

00:55.347 --> 00:56.348
"Stairway to Heaven."

00:56.348 --> 00:57.557
- That's pretty awesome.

00:57.557 --> 00:59.017
- Yeah, not so much.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.686
The version went on,
like, for 20 minutes.

01:00.686 --> 01:02.521
- Micki had enough time
to climb back up into heaven and

01:02.521 --> 01:04.606
grab John Bonham, and bring him
back down to Earth to say,

01:04.606 --> 01:05.941
"Hey, douche bags,

01:05.941 --> 01:07.901
enough with the 20-minute
Mellotron flute solos."

01:07.901 --> 01:10.153
- God, I would have crawled
into the box with Micki.

01:10.153 --> 01:11.947
Who gave this to you guys,
by the way?

01:11.947 --> 01:13.574
- Her little, sad roommate.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.284
Her parents are dead,
no siblings.

01:15.284 --> 01:16.493
- Yeah, she told her
when she died,

01:16.493 --> 01:17.995
she wanted her ashes
dumped in the river

01:17.995 --> 01:19.580
next to the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame

01:19.580 --> 01:21.123
and wanted us to do it.

01:21.123 --> 01:23.000
- God, I've never seen
a box of ashes before.

01:23.000 --> 01:23.959
It's so creepy,
you know?

01:23.959 --> 01:25.544
- Yeah.

01:25.544 --> 01:29.047
- Someone's hair and face
and teeth and toenails.

01:29.047 --> 01:30.424
Could we open it up?

01:30.424 --> 01:31.550
- No, we're not opening it up.
- No!

01:31.550 --> 01:32.968
- Okay, relax.

01:36.555 --> 01:37.889
- Oh, my God.
- You guys.

01:37.889 --> 01:39.308
- What?
- Listen.

01:39.308 --> 01:40.976
[box rattling]
- [chuckles]

01:40.976 --> 01:43.729
- It sounds like maracas.
- [moans]

01:43.729 --> 01:44.938
That was Micki's instrument.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.106
We sang backup.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.442
I was tambourine;
she was maracas.

01:48.442 --> 01:49.776
Is this what's gonna
happen to me?

01:49.776 --> 01:51.987
I'm gonna end up some box
of anonymous ashes

01:51.987 --> 01:54.114
that sound like a stupid
percussion instrument?

01:54.114 --> 01:55.866
You make sure that
when I'm cremated,

01:55.866 --> 01:57.367
you put some earrings in here

01:57.367 --> 01:59.661
so that my ashes get the full
tambourine effect, okay?

01:59.661 --> 02:01.997

and lots of balloons

03:07.771 --> 03:10.607
and marching bands and dancers
and, yeah, a big deal.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.442

to be famous to get a parade.

03:12.442 --> 03:13.527

03:13.527 --> 03:14.736

03:38.260 --> 03:39.845
Rehab can have this done.

03:39.845 --> 03:41.054
He had all Bam's stuff done.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.431
It looks great.
Let me give it to him.

03:42.431 --> 03:44.015
We could be watching it
by tomorrow afternoon.

03:44.015 --> 03:45.767
- Yeah, well, Flash is taking me
to Micki's tomorrow morning

03:45.767 --> 03:47.185
to pick up some
of her belongings,

03:47.185 --> 03:48.770
so just make sure you wait
until we're back

03:48.770 --> 03:49.813

comfortable watching this

04:11.818 --> 04:12.716

04:12.716 --> 04:14.860
It's a professional courtesy
in the transfer world.

04:14.860 --> 04:17.424
- Honey, I kind of agree.
Maybe we should wait.

04:17.424 --> 04:18.758

my girl Gigi.

04:18.758 --> 04:20.218

Ava's not gonna care
if we get a head start.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.223
Besides, I'm gonna watch it

07:26.529 --> 07:27.989
It's a completely
different situation.

07:27.989 --> 07:29.449
- Oh, okay, so Micki
doesn't count.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.117
But you know what?
- No, she doesn't count.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.702
- Flash's wife did,
and so did Rehab's ex-fiancée.

07:32.702 --> 07:34.454
- I told you a million times,
that was just sex, okay?

07:34.454 --> 07:36.206
We just saw video evidence
of you having a year-long affair

07:36.206 --> 07:37.666
with my supposed best friend

07:37.666 --> 07:40.585
that lasted way longer than you
told me it lasted, okay?

07:40.585 --> 07:41.920
Like an extra fucking year.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.254
- What difference
does that make?

07:43.254 --> 07:44.756
- It makes a big difference
to me, okay?

07:44.756 --> 07:46.633
- John, okay, he encouraged me
to write songs,

07:46.633 --> 07:48.593
which is more than
what you ever did.

07:48.593 --> 07:50.345
- Oh, I'm sure he did.
- He thought that I had talent.

07:50.345 --> 07:52.305
- Oh, yeah, and you
showed him the talent.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.848
I'm sure of that, right?

07:53.848 --> 07:55.934
- He wanted me to crawl out
from under your shadow.

07:55.934 --> 07:57.143
And you know what?
I did.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.020
- Mm-hmm.
- And I liked it.

07:59.020 --> 08:01.022
I liked it a lot.

08:01.022 --> 08:02.565
- Good.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.317
So then why'd you break up
with him then?

08:04.317 --> 08:06.653
- Because things ended, okay?

08:06.653 --> 08:08.071
Flash broke up with me.

08:08.071 --> 08:10.073
He went back on tour. Wa--

08:10.073 --> 08:12.409
[sighs]

08:12.409 --> 08:14.994
- Great.

08:14.994 --> 08:17.080
Wow.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.498
- Johnny.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.834
- Holy shit.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.336
- I asked you. I asked you three
times when we were dating

08:23.336 --> 08:25.797
if you and Ava had a thing,
and all three times you said no.

08:25.797 --> 08:27.465
I don't know why you lied to me.

08:27.465 --> 08:30.468
- 'Cause I was protecting Ava,
your dad, not to mention you.

08:30.468 --> 08:31.970
- Oh, you're protecting me?
- That's right.

08:31.970 --> 08:33.304
I knew you
wouldn't understand.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.140
- All right, well,
you know what?

08:35.140 --> 08:36.141
You were right.

08:36.141 --> 08:37.976
I don't understand.

08:37.976 --> 08:41.187
- Gigi, baby, let me--
let me just explain.

08:43.231 --> 08:44.774
Gig?

08:44.774 --> 08:47.944
[camera shutter clicking]

08:52.699 --> 08:53.867
What are you doing?

08:53.867 --> 08:55.201
[camera shutter clicks]

08:55.201 --> 08:56.786
- Now I'm gonna Face Swap.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.955
Put the camera down.
[chuckles]

09:05.439 --> 09:07.088
- Come on, man.
Don't take my picture.

09:07.088 --> 09:08.423
I'm not in the mood.

09:08.423 --> 09:09.591
- I know. I got it.
I'm sorry, man.

09:09.591 --> 09:11.217
- Such a nightmare.

09:11.217 --> 09:12.677
I should have been honest
with her right from the start.

09:12.677 --> 09:13.762
I broke her trust.

09:13.762 --> 09:14.763
Now I got to win it back.

09:14.763 --> 09:16.014
- Pah-pah!

09:16.014 --> 09:17.265
- Jesus, man,
what did I just say?

09:17.265 --> 09:19.225
- I know. I know. I know.
I'm sorry.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.269
You look so handsome
when you're sad,

09:21.269 --> 09:22.687
especially in this light.

09:22.687 --> 09:24.230
It's very flattering.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.983
- It is?
- Yeah.

09:26.983 --> 09:29.778
Plus, makes you look
ten years younger.

09:29.778 --> 09:33.573
And you saw the photo they used
for Mickey's memorial card.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.116
Sucky.

09:35.116 --> 09:37.452
If you drop dead
ten minutes from now,

09:37.452 --> 09:39.120
what do you want them to use?

09:39.120 --> 09:41.581
Some raggedy-ass old flash photo
from 15 years ago

09:41.581 --> 09:42.624
when you were fat?

09:42.624 --> 09:44.042
Or do you want
something striking?

09:44.042 --> 09:46.044
Something current?

09:46.044 --> 09:47.796
- I like striking.

09:47.796 --> 09:49.047
- Good.

09:49.047 --> 09:52.133
Then stand right here.
Here.

09:52.133 --> 09:55.053
Here, here, here, here.

09:55.053 --> 09:56.429
I like it.

09:56.429 --> 09:57.764
All right.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.057
Oh, you lucky son of a bitch.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.391
Look at that pile of cheekbones.

10:00.391 --> 10:01.392
Let it go.

10:01.392 --> 10:02.227
Ooh.

10:02.227 --> 10:03.812
What are you thinking about?

10:03.812 --> 10:05.313
- Thinking about Gigi.

10:05.313 --> 10:09.943
- Okay, then think
about her-r-r...

10:09.943 --> 10:11.194
right here.

10:11.194 --> 10:12.779
Nice.
[camera shutter clicking]

10:12.779 --> 10:13.780
Boom.

10:13.780 --> 10:14.781
Boom, boom.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.116
That's nice.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.117
Ooh.
Nice.

10:17.117 --> 10:18.326
Turn over--turn over there.

10:18.326 --> 10:20.120
Look at there.
Now look at me.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.455
Boom!
I like it.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.790
I like it.

10:23.790 --> 10:26.084
Ooh.
Ah.

10:26.084 --> 10:27.418
You look hurt.

10:27.418 --> 10:28.670
- I am hurt.

10:28.670 --> 10:30.630
Feel like my heart's bruised.
- Really?

10:30.630 --> 10:31.923
- Yeah, really.

10:31.923 --> 10:32.924
What, you think
I'm fucking around?

10:32.924 --> 10:33.925
- Ooh, I love that.

10:33.925 --> 10:34.926
Flash! Anger!

10:34.926 --> 10:36.094
Show me some more of that shit.

10:36.094 --> 10:37.512
Ooh, I love it.
I love it.

10:37.512 --> 10:41.432
Um, think about...

10:41.432 --> 10:44.102
Think about, uh...

10:44.102 --> 10:46.187
Ava.
Ooh.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.480
What the hell was that look?

10:47.480 --> 10:48.815
- What look?

10:48.815 --> 10:51.818
- That look you just gave me
when I said, "Think about Ava."

10:51.818 --> 10:52.819
- Really?

10:52.819 --> 10:54.696
- Yeah.

10:54.696 --> 10:55.697
I like it.

10:55.697 --> 10:56.698
I love it.

10:56.698 --> 10:57.907
Think about her more.

10:57.907 --> 11:00.326
- All right.
- Ooh, she smolders you.

11:00.326 --> 11:01.494
- All right, I'm done
thinking about Ava.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.997
I want to think
about Gigi now.

11:03.997 --> 11:04.998
- Okay, okay.

11:04.998 --> 11:05.999
Okay.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.667
Not Ava.

11:07.667 --> 11:08.793
Not Ava.

11:08.793 --> 11:10.044
What the hell's that?

11:10.044 --> 11:11.462
No, no,
don't stick your butt out.

11:11.462 --> 11:12.463
Look up.

11:12.463 --> 11:13.798
Good.

11:13.798 --> 11:16.009
- I had all this anxiety
about being a lead singer

11:16.009 --> 11:17.468
out in front of the band.

11:17.468 --> 11:18.469
Not my thing.

11:18.469 --> 11:21.347
But behind the band,
I felt safe.

11:21.347 --> 11:25.727
And Flash, he just peeled
this layer of fear right off me.

11:25.727 --> 11:27.061
Made me believe in myself.

11:27.061 --> 11:29.772
I felt confident and strong.

11:29.772 --> 11:33.234
Oh, and then revenge sex
turned into more revenge sex,

11:33.234 --> 11:35.278
turned into Nashville,
and we were both from there,

11:35.278 --> 11:38.615
so this whole--this whole
cowboy thing that we had,

11:38.615 --> 11:40.617
we lost it when
we moved to New York.

11:40.617 --> 11:44.621
And so we were riding horses
and hanging out on the farm

11:44.621 --> 11:47.373
and doing it in a field.

11:47.373 --> 11:49.542
He brought out
the Carrie Underwood in me.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.085
- I don't think there's any
Carrie Underwood in you.

11:51.085 --> 11:53.379
Maybe Gretchen Wilson
on tequila.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.256
- Ugh.

11:55.256 --> 11:56.341
I am an almost-stepmom

11:56.341 --> 11:57.717
telling her almost-stepdaughter

11:57.717 --> 12:00.178
how great the guy
they both slept with was.

12:00.178 --> 12:03.681
Okay, this is--I really am
a Gretchen Wilson song.

12:03.681 --> 12:04.766
Redneck stepmom.

12:04.766 --> 12:05.892
Yee-haw!

12:05.892 --> 12:06.935
Yeah!
[blows raspberry]

12:06.935 --> 12:11.105
- Ugh.
- [sighs]

12:11.105 --> 12:13.233
This is awkward.
- [chuckles]

12:13.233 --> 12:15.568
- But it was 20 years ago.

12:15.568 --> 12:18.112
Hear Flash out
and give him a chance.

12:18.112 --> 12:20.573
- Yeah, no, no,
I'm going to.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.283
I want to bang somebody
in a field.

12:22.283 --> 12:23.743
I've never done that.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.119
- Oh, yeah, you got to.

12:25.119 --> 12:26.746
- I really want to.
- Yeah.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.248
No, yeah, and you can't
put things like that off.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.666
- No, I won't.

12:29.666 --> 12:31.042
- You have the impulse,
you got to act on it.

12:31.042 --> 12:33.253
- Yeah.
- 'Cause look at Micki.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.921
- I know; she's a box of ashes
on our kitchen table.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.297
- [moans]
- I'm gonna do it.

12:36.297 --> 12:38.258
I'm just gonna bang
some guy's brains out

12:38.258 --> 12:39.259
right in the middle of a field.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.885
Total heat of passion,

12:40.885 --> 12:42.262
spur-of-the-moment
type thing, you know?

12:42.262 --> 12:43.596
Were you all itchy afterwards?

12:43.596 --> 12:45.056
Don't answer that.
I'm overthinking it.

12:45.056 --> 12:46.307
I'm probably not gonna
do it anyway.

12:46.307 --> 12:48.059
[sighs]

12:57.610 --> 13:00.113
- Hey.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.282
I thought I'd find you here.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.616
[door rattles closed]

13:06.202 --> 13:08.496
What are you doing?

13:10.206 --> 13:12.292
- I'm 51 years old,
and I just found out

13:12.292 --> 13:15.920
that my supposed best friend
on the planet

13:15.920 --> 13:20.174
had a year-long affair with
the one true love of my life,

13:20.174 --> 13:24.512
and I can't afford
to smash his guitars.

13:24.512 --> 13:26.306
[sighs]

13:26.306 --> 13:29.517
But I did flush 200 of his picks
down the toilet.

13:29.517 --> 13:31.436
Oh, yeah.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.104
Do not hug me.

13:33.104 --> 13:34.314
- You need a hug, John.
- No.

13:34.314 --> 13:37.150
- You need a hug, bro.
- No. Dude.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.818
You know what I need?
I need a change.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.737
That's what I need.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.321
I'm--I'm moving out.

13:42.321 --> 13:43.990
Dude, I'm moving out,
and I'm moving on.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.491
Did you know how many chicks
there are out there

13:45.491 --> 13:47.160
that would love to shack up
with a guy like me?

13:47.160 --> 13:48.661
There's--what?
- None.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.830
Zero. Zilch.
- No, no, dude. There's a ton--

13:50.830 --> 13:52.915
- You're old; you're broke;
you're really selfish.

13:52.915 --> 13:56.044
Seriously, man, dude, you're not
even a lead singer anymore.

13:56.044 --> 13:57.462
- No, no, no,
I got that covered.

13:57.462 --> 13:59.172
- And that's the only way
a guy like you,

13:59.172 --> 14:01.799
your age,
your financial situation,

14:01.799 --> 14:04.135
with that hair,
is ever getting laid, man.

14:04.135 --> 14:05.553
- But listen to me, all right?

14:05.553 --> 14:07.138
I've been thinking about
this for a long time,

14:07.138 --> 14:08.514
and I'm gonna pull
the trigger on it now.

14:08.514 --> 14:10.308
I got a new band, new name.
- Oh, God.

14:10.308 --> 14:12.060
- Think.
Johnny Rock Agenda.

14:12.060 --> 14:14.062
Cool, right?
It's like a throwback vibe.

14:14.062 --> 14:15.730
I'ma do, like,
a Hives meets The Who.

14:15.730 --> 14:17.607
Like, they get drunk with
David Johansen type of vibe.

14:17.607 --> 14:18.566
You want to be the drummer?

14:18.566 --> 14:20.193
- Absolutely not.
- Why not?

14:20.193 --> 14:23.112
- Because I'm
Gigi's drummer, asshole.

14:23.112 --> 14:24.781
It's not about you, Johnny.

14:24.781 --> 14:27.283
It's not about Ava.
It's not about Flash.

14:27.283 --> 14:29.202
It's about your daughter.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.369
You know what your agenda
should be?

14:30.369 --> 14:31.704
Her.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.623
You know, the karma, the kismet,
whatever the hell it is,

14:33.623 --> 14:36.417
all your sins from the past
coming back to haunt you,

14:36.417 --> 14:38.377
you know,
that was 25 years ago.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.838
Yesterday's dead and gone, pal.

14:40.838 --> 14:43.424
Tomorrow, there's no guarantees.

14:43.424 --> 14:44.592
You know who doesn't have
a tomorrow?

14:44.592 --> 14:45.593
Micki.

14:45.593 --> 14:46.886
How's that grab you?

14:46.886 --> 14:48.554
You know what?

14:48.554 --> 14:49.847
Right now,

14:49.847 --> 14:51.390
right now is all you got.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.518
Right now...

14:53.518 --> 14:55.895
it's everything.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.776
- Are you quoting
Sammy Hagar to me?

15:01.776 --> 15:02.944
- No.

15:02.944 --> 15:04.487
- Yeah, yeah, I think you were.
- Am I?

15:04.487 --> 15:05.738
- Yeah, yeah, and I think
you got it all screwed up.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.115
- Did I really?

15:07.115 --> 15:08.449
- Yeah, Van Halen, Sammy Hagar,
you quoted me.

15:08.449 --> 15:10.076
- I did.
- Yeah.

15:10.076 --> 15:12.245
- Van Hagar.
I love that guy.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.246
- I know.
- My God.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.330
I love those songs.

15:14.330 --> 15:17.291
How could I mess up the lyrics?

15:17.291 --> 15:20.586
- Bro, we're getting old, okay?
- Yeah.

15:20.586 --> 15:21.587
- Time is a bitch.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.047
Counting out numbers,

15:23.047 --> 15:24.132
both of us know
we ain't getting no younger.

15:24.132 --> 15:26.092
- Hmm.
Bruce Springsteen.

15:26.092 --> 15:27.552
- No, dude, that's Cat.

15:27.552 --> 15:29.887
That's the Cat song
you played on last year.

15:29.887 --> 15:31.722
- Are you kidding me?

15:31.722 --> 15:35.893
- Bro, right now, you might
need an Alzheimer's test, psh.

15:35.893 --> 15:39.689
- How the hell does a guy that's
killing brain cells as we speak

15:39.689 --> 15:43.025
know more lyrics than the guy
who's been sober for 15 years?

15:43.025 --> 15:45.153
- Because I'm a lead singer,
okay?

15:45.153 --> 15:46.779
I could be in a coma
and still sing side one

15:46.779 --> 15:48.781
of "London Calling."

15:48.781 --> 15:49.991
Yeah, I got to go solo, bro.

15:49.991 --> 15:51.117
You know what?

15:51.117 --> 15:52.118
That's what I was born to do.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.619
- All right.

15:53.619 --> 15:54.787
- I'm a lead singer.

15:54.787 --> 15:55.830
- Whoo-whee.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.540
- Born to do it.

16:00.084 --> 16:01.586
- You have a change of heart?

16:04.422 --> 16:06.132
- Yeah.

16:06.132 --> 16:07.592
You know how much money
Sammy Hagar made

16:07.592 --> 16:10.094
off that Cabo Wabo Tequila
when he left Van Halen?

16:10.094 --> 16:11.762
Like 90 million bucks.

16:11.762 --> 16:13.014
Just hear me out.

16:13.014 --> 16:14.599
The Johnny Rock Agenda
takes off, huh.

16:14.599 --> 16:16.100
Johnny Rock's
Demon Rum and Cola.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.977
It comes, like,
in a cool bottle,

16:17.977 --> 16:19.770
like, black with, like,
a gold flake

16:19.770 --> 16:20.897
skull and crossbones on it.

16:20.897 --> 16:22.148
We can jack up the price.

16:22.148 --> 16:23.649
What do you think?

16:23.649 --> 16:25.735
- I'm sober, dude.

16:25.735 --> 16:28.571
- Dude, doesn't mean you can't
make money off drunk people.

16:28.571 --> 16:31.657
- God help your soul.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.367
- Think about it.

16:39.310 --> 16:40.774
- You think I didn't want
to lord this over your dad

16:40.774 --> 16:43.999
from the very first second
after Ava and I had sex

16:43.999 --> 16:45.318
for the first time?

16:45.318 --> 16:47.298
You bet your ass.

16:47.298 --> 16:50.301
I was so psyched, I didn't want
to do it over the phone.

16:50.301 --> 16:51.802
I wanted to do it in person
so I could see the look

16:51.802 --> 16:54.639
on his back-stabbing,
skinny bitch horse face

16:54.639 --> 16:55.973
when he finally found out.

16:55.973 --> 16:58.309
- Whoa, relax.

16:58.309 --> 16:59.810
So tell me what happened.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.062
- Ava happened.

17:01.062 --> 17:02.438
Big-time blindsided me,

17:02.438 --> 17:04.190
and just like...
[snaps fingers]

17:04.190 --> 17:07.109
That, I was smitten.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.861
- You were smitten?

17:08.861 --> 17:12.031
- It's not a word that I usually
use, but I was smitten by her.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.241
I was...

17:13.241 --> 17:15.117
besotted,
captivated.

17:15.117 --> 17:17.245
It was like being in a hurricane
for a whole year,

17:17.245 --> 17:19.455
just flying around, man.

17:19.455 --> 17:21.290
We burned it down
in Nashville.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.584
Then I caught a tour.
I go on the road.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.878
And Johnny's calling her,
"Come back,"

17:25.878 --> 17:28.839
and, you know, it was over.

17:28.839 --> 17:30.758
- And then I guess you thought
you could get revenge on my dad

17:30.758 --> 17:32.426
by sleeping with me.

17:32.426 --> 17:35.846
- Hey.

17:35.846 --> 17:38.015
- Am I right?

17:38.015 --> 17:39.559
- Yeah, you're right.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.269
Then I got to know you,

17:41.269 --> 17:43.396
and I saw how much
all this means to you--

17:43.396 --> 17:46.566
the band, your relationship
with Ava,

17:46.566 --> 17:48.651
the whole nine yards,

17:48.651 --> 17:51.612
and I was...

17:51.612 --> 17:53.573
- If you say "smitten"
right now,

17:53.573 --> 17:55.950
I'm gonna kick you
in the balls.

17:55.950 --> 17:57.410
- Enraptured.

have not heard from him.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.205
- Maybe he went to Cleveland
to spread Micki's ashes

18:43.205 --> 18:44.957
in the river next to
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.125

to Cleveland

18:46.125 --> 18:48.252
if they were giving out
free coke.

18:48.252 --> 18:49.503

a cocaine wing

18:49.503 --> 18:50.921
at the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

18:50.921 --> 18:52.340

18:52.340 --> 18:54.091

on the first ballot.

19:01.098 --> 19:03.934
- John?
Why didn't you text me back?

19:03.934 --> 19:07.480

for all of us to celebrate.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.315
Bam already knows what it is.

19:09.315 --> 19:11.651
- I--I tried to talk him
out of it, so--

19:11.651 --> 19:14.153
- Cabo Wabo for everybody.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.821
Bam and Re, you can have
coffee or water, whatever.

19:15.821 --> 19:19.158
Just make sure you do the actual
toast for karma purposes.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.744
Here you go.

19:21.744 --> 19:23.663
Yep.

19:23.663 --> 19:27.416
Here is to...

19:27.416 --> 19:29.794
a great American philosopher,

19:29.794 --> 19:31.128
Sammy Hagar,

19:31.128 --> 19:32.463
Van Halen's Sammy Hagar,

19:32.463 --> 19:36.634
who once said
two very important words:

19:36.634 --> 19:39.053
"Right now."

19:39.053 --> 19:42.807
Fuck the past, the future--
this ain't Nashville in 1994.

Here's to Gigi

19:46.644 --> 19:50.356
and our dysfunctional little
kick-ass rock and roll family.

19:50.356 --> 19:51.399
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

19:51.399 --> 19:52.608
both: Whoo!
- Forever.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.026
- Cheers.

19:54.026 --> 19:57.738
- Mm, and what we're gonna
do is, we're gonna play

19:57.738 --> 19:59.198
Micki's favorite Heathens
song of all time,

19:59.198 --> 20:00.908
"Ain't No Valentine,"

20:00.908 --> 20:02.618
and, honey, you're gonna play
Micki's percussion part.

20:02.618 --> 20:04.537
- With what?
- These.

20:04.537 --> 20:06.706
I had this buddy of mine
at Steve Maxwell's

20:06.706 --> 20:09.542
do a rush job last night putting
Micki's ashes into these maracas

20:09.542 --> 20:11.252
so she's gonna be
with us forever,

20:11.252 --> 20:12.670
or at least until next time
we go to Cleveland.

20:15.506 --> 20:16.674
- Dad.
- Yeah.

20:16.674 --> 20:17.883
- Did you get to see the ashes?
- Yes, I did.

20:17.883 --> 20:19.343
- What did they look like?

20:19.343 --> 20:20.720
- They looked like a pile
of the really cheap blow

20:20.720 --> 20:23.055
we used to buy down on Avenue A
back in the day.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.515
It was weird.
- That is the circle of life.

20:24.515 --> 20:26.183
- You guys, uh,
let's kick the song off.

20:26.183 --> 20:27.560
- Gigi, you know the lyrics.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.729
- Oh, yeah,
I've always loved this one.

20:29.729 --> 20:33.607

20:33.607 --> 20:35.609
