WEBVTT

00:52.436 --> 00:54.472
Clint?

00:54.506 --> 00:56.173
Clint!

00:56.608 --> 00:58.676
How did you get up there?

00:58.710 --> 00:59.744
First rule of magic.

00:59.777 --> 01:01.111
You know that.

01:01.144 --> 01:03.080
That's not funny, you scared me.

01:21.365 --> 01:22.366
It's time.

01:24.569 --> 01:26.303
I think it's fine.

01:27.639 --> 01:29.206
Can I just finish my hot dog?

01:33.310 --> 01:35.245
I just don't see what the big
rush is.

01:37.147 --> 01:38.348
We keep moving.

03:18.583 --> 03:20.551
Good?

03:20.585 --> 03:21.786
Looks awful.

03:21.819 --> 03:23.220
No.

03:23.253 --> 03:24.254
Come on now.

03:32.664 --> 03:33.665
Thank you.

03:36.400 --> 03:37.468
Got it?
Yep.

03:54.485 --> 03:57.622
So Cheryl must have had blue
eyes.

03:57.655 --> 04:00.558
You know the book you're
reading there is out of date.

04:00.591 --> 04:02.493
It used to be that to
determine the eye color

04:02.527 --> 04:03.661
was a single gene trait,

04:03.695 --> 04:07.498
but now they're saying that it's
actually

04:07.532 --> 04:08.933
eight different genes that
determine

04:08.966 --> 04:10.702
the amount of melanin in an
iris.

04:11.602 --> 04:14.839
If I have blue eyes,
and you have brown eyes,

04:16.406 --> 04:18.408
then Cheryl must have had blue
eyes too.

04:19.341 --> 04:20.812
Sure.

04:20.845 --> 04:21.846
You don't know?

04:22.880 --> 04:24.414
What's your guess?

04:24.448 --> 04:26.617
My guess is blue.

04:26.651 --> 04:27.618
There you go.

04:27.652 --> 04:29.654
That's in your book, right?

04:30.088 --> 04:32.890
She's probably still
somewhere in the South, right?

04:32.924 --> 04:36.326
South, California, the moon.

04:37.528 --> 04:38.496
Doesn't matter.

04:38.529 --> 04:39.731
It was just a question.

04:39.764 --> 04:41.032
Yeah, well the point is that

04:41.065 --> 04:43.534
she zigged and we zagged.

05:14.766 --> 05:15.967
800 books I believe.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.870
I mean, who has that in their
library?

05:18.903 --> 05:21.271
Oh miss, I'll check that out for
you.

05:22.740 --> 05:24.475
Do you have a library card,
dear?

06:02.513 --> 06:05.583
You don't have to pay 400
dollars for a new sink.

06:05.616 --> 06:07.585
No, they're just trying to rip
you off.

06:08.719 --> 06:12.123
Alright, there you go.

06:12.156 --> 06:13.124
There it is.

06:13.157 --> 06:13.958
It just fits on like so.

06:13.991 --> 06:15.726
There's these little nubs on the
nut.

06:15.760 --> 06:17.028
Okay.
It fits perfectly on it,

06:17.061 --> 06:19.564
and you turn it clockwise and
done.

06:19.597 --> 06:21.065
So it must come in pretty handy

06:21.098 --> 06:22.733
knowing how to fix everything,
huh?

06:22.767 --> 06:24.735
Yeah, we wouldn't get
very far

06:24.769 --> 06:26.537
without knowing how to fix
things.

06:27.905 --> 06:30.708
Humans have been a migratory
species

06:30.741 --> 06:31.976
since we've been on Earth.

06:32.777 --> 06:36.614
Nola and I are just
going back to our roots.

06:36.647 --> 06:37.949
She's been on the road since
before

06:37.982 --> 06:39.083
she could even walk.

06:40.117 --> 06:41.118
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

06:41.152 --> 06:43.154
You weren't worried
about her adjusting?

06:43.187 --> 06:44.622
Adjusting to what?

06:46.057 --> 06:49.426
Life without brain-numbing
television?

06:49.460 --> 06:51.028
Then no.

06:51.062 --> 06:52.864
You know, we're pursuing I would
call it

06:52.897 --> 06:56.767
the low budget high
experience model of living.

06:57.568 --> 07:01.038
No amount of money can buy
an education like that.

07:04.642 --> 07:07.645
I mean, we've been...

07:22.693 --> 07:24.996
You know, you could've fixed
that with your eyes closed

07:25.029 --> 07:26.898
and one hand tied behind your
back.

07:26.931 --> 07:28.431
She was ready to go out and buy
herself

07:28.466 --> 07:29.767
a whole new sink.

07:29.800 --> 07:32.003
You're just always
looking for new converts.

07:32.036 --> 07:34.872
You know, society will be much
better off

07:34.906 --> 07:38.175
once we build an army of
self-sufficient agitators.

07:38.209 --> 07:40.978
If we consume less, we produce
less.

07:41.012 --> 07:42.713
But you'd earn less.

07:42.747 --> 07:45.583
Yes, but you notice that I did
not

07:45.616 --> 07:47.551
teach her how to fix the sink.

07:47.585 --> 07:48.418
You see?

07:48.452 --> 07:50.821
Now, granted, the world is not
ready

07:50.855 --> 07:53.758
to bend to our ways, I will give
you that.

07:53.791 --> 07:55.493
Not everyone wants to live like
us.

07:55.526 --> 07:58.930
Of course they do.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.536
Fear is the only thing
holding these people back.

08:06.671 --> 08:07.672
They've got their driveways,

08:07.705 --> 08:10.708
they've got their
backyards, got their pools.

08:11.776 --> 08:13.244
We have our freedom.

08:13.277 --> 08:16.047
Right now we just
have a lot of laundry.

09:15.840 --> 09:17.208
Let's go.

09:17.241 --> 09:19.276
You can picture the rest up in
your head.

09:21.846 --> 09:24.548
Some people watch it
'til the end, you know.

09:24.582 --> 09:28.853
Yeah, some people don't
know what they're missing.

10:21.072 --> 10:22.073
Come on.

10:34.852 --> 10:36.287
What's going on?

10:36.320 --> 10:39.824
I can never stay until the end
of a movie.

10:40.858 --> 10:42.660
We're always on your time.

10:42.693 --> 10:44.829
I can't watch 'til the end of a
movie

10:44.862 --> 10:47.264
without you making me hop
around.

10:47.298 --> 10:49.100
Do you know how exhausting that
is?

11:08.119 --> 11:09.120
Thanks.

11:40.918 --> 11:41.919
Let's go.

11:48.425 --> 11:49.426
Thank you.

12:04.742 --> 12:05.743
Night Nola.

13:15.079 --> 13:18.015
Am I to expect another full
day of the silent treatment?

13:19.551 --> 13:21.218
Can't give your old man a break?

13:26.290 --> 13:28.392
Guess where we're going next.

13:28.425 --> 13:29.426
Doesn't matter.

13:30.394 --> 13:33.330
Okay, well then how
about I give you a hint?

13:35.232 --> 13:36.300
Your namesake.

13:41.138 --> 13:42.172
I've said too much.

13:43.874 --> 13:45.075
We're not really going.

13:47.411 --> 13:49.079
You said I could only go once
I'm 21.

13:49.113 --> 13:50.247
Well I'm sure we'll still find a
way

13:50.281 --> 13:51.882
to get ourselves into trouble.

13:53.017 --> 13:54.084
Are you serious?

13:54.118 --> 13:55.152
We're going to New Orleans.

13:55.185 --> 13:56.987
No better time than now, right?

13:57.021 --> 13:58.556
You promise.
Cross my heart.

14:03.894 --> 14:04.928
Where'd you get that?

14:08.198 --> 14:09.601
Found it at the pool.

14:09.634 --> 14:10.834
Suits you.

14:11.603 --> 14:13.437
Good morning, gentlemen.

14:13.471 --> 14:15.205
- Hey.
- How's it going?

14:15.239 --> 14:16.206
Is this your ride?

14:16.240 --> 14:17.207
This is the ride, yes.

14:17.241 --> 14:18.842
This is The Hulk.

14:18.876 --> 14:19.843
Oh, sweet man.

14:19.877 --> 14:20.712
Thank you.
The Hulk?

14:20.745 --> 14:22.946
Need a better paint job for that
name.

14:23.615 --> 14:26.083
Y'all come down for the van
festival?

14:26.116 --> 14:27.251
What's that?

14:27.284 --> 14:29.053
It's a big annual gathering.

14:31.889 --> 14:34.024
One of those gatherings where

14:34.058 --> 14:35.460
everyone heads back after to
their

14:35.493 --> 14:39.363
cozy little homes and describe

14:39.396 --> 14:43.468
how they had a crazy weekend in
the wild.

14:45.135 --> 14:46.136
No.

14:47.204 --> 14:49.340
Nola and I, we get ourselves
million dollar views

14:49.373 --> 14:51.609
wherever we go without
paying property taxes.

14:52.510 --> 14:55.079
So, you travel full time?

14:55.112 --> 14:56.113
Yes sir.

14:56.914 --> 14:58.583
What did you do before?

14:58.616 --> 15:02.152
Well, I actually had a bar.

15:03.621 --> 15:05.289
What was it called?

15:05.322 --> 15:06.323
Nola.

15:07.358 --> 15:08.593
It was called The Mercury Bar.

15:09.561 --> 15:10.994
This was in Albuquerque?

15:13.163 --> 15:14.998
Weren't we there like last
Summer?

15:15.999 --> 15:18.102
No it was two Summers ago, man.

15:19.303 --> 15:20.505
North Carolina.

15:38.322 --> 15:39.323
Hey, good morning.

15:40.658 --> 15:42.192
Good morning.

15:43.160 --> 15:44.596
Head's pounding this morning.

15:51.569 --> 15:52.570
How'd you sleep?

15:55.038 --> 15:56.140
Good.

16:02.312 --> 16:03.280
Where to?

16:03.313 --> 16:04.314
New Orleans.

16:09.420 --> 16:11.288
Yeah, yeah, we will.

16:12.457 --> 16:15.527
Just, getting my head on.

16:18.362 --> 16:20.964
I thought you said we were
really going this time.

16:26.270 --> 16:27.271
Yes.

16:28.338 --> 16:32.109
New Orleans is sinking,
and I don't want to swim.

16:34.479 --> 16:35.480
What?

16:39.349 --> 16:40.350
Watch the rocket.

16:42.352 --> 16:43.353
Clint.

16:45.055 --> 16:46.056
Clint, stop.

16:51.361 --> 16:52.362
Dad...

16:55.733 --> 16:56.734
Clint?

16:59.403 --> 17:02.439
Dad.

17:36.373 --> 17:37.742
I need you to complete this.

17:39.142 --> 17:40.143
Take your time.

17:57.394 --> 17:59.497
Hello, yes, we have a minor
here.

18:02.467 --> 18:04.368
Her father, no other living
family.

18:19.449 --> 18:21.051
Yes, we have her waiting here.

18:29.861 --> 18:31.729
Where's the bathroom?

18:31.763 --> 18:32.730
Just down the hallway

18:32.764 --> 18:33.765
on the right-hand side.

20:58.408 --> 20:59.409
Please.

21:39.550 --> 21:41.919
Shame on them for letting
them all go to waste.

22:00.104 --> 22:01.706
Well today's your lucky day.

22:01.739 --> 22:03.440
All of those hot dogs are yours.

22:05.342 --> 22:06.811
They were gonna go in the trash.

22:08.513 --> 22:10.347
Thank you so much.

22:10.380 --> 22:11.616
That's...
No problem.

22:11.649 --> 22:12.650
Thanks.

22:13.651 --> 22:14.619
Where are you driving to

22:14.652 --> 22:15.686
in the middle of the night?

22:16.353 --> 22:21.058
I'm just on a cross country road
trip.

22:21.092 --> 22:22.660
Where'd you start out from?

22:25.797 --> 22:26.764
Arizona.

22:26.798 --> 22:28.365
Arizona, I've never been there.

22:32.537 --> 22:33.938
Thank you so much.

22:34.872 --> 22:35.873
My pleasure.

22:39.710 --> 22:41.946
That's a big van you're
driving all by yourself.

22:41.979 --> 22:43.848
I hope you don't mind my saying
that.

22:43.881 --> 22:46.083
You know, I could never
drive such a big vehicle.

22:46.117 --> 22:48.119
Yeah, my dad taught me.

22:48.152 --> 22:49.453
And you're driving straight
through,

22:49.487 --> 22:51.789
all the way from Arizona.

22:52.890 --> 22:54.492
I'm on my way to college.

22:54.525 --> 22:55.626
And how old are you?

22:56.794 --> 23:01.065
Listen, you need to work on your
act.

23:01.098 --> 23:02.700
Just say you're emancipated.

23:05.169 --> 23:07.370
Look, I know you need to go.

23:07.404 --> 23:10.373
There's a Sunday potluck
at the church in town.

23:11.642 --> 23:13.110
And you're very welcome to come.

23:15.012 --> 23:16.013
I hope to see you there.

24:06.597 --> 24:08.833
You can't park here.

24:08.866 --> 24:09.867
Look.

24:10.801 --> 24:12.169
My boyfriend kicked me out of
our spot.

24:12.203 --> 24:15.438
Can you just let it go for one
night?

24:15.473 --> 24:17.508
The van is fine parked here.

24:17.541 --> 24:18.943
You can't stay.

24:18.976 --> 24:22.079
So you're saying a car is
more important than a person.

24:22.113 --> 24:24.447
Ma'am, it's a parking lot.

24:26.017 --> 24:28.786
Here's what I can do in this
situation.

24:28.819 --> 24:30.021
I can either call the cops

24:30.054 --> 24:32.123
and you can spend the
night at the station,

24:32.156 --> 24:33.190
or you can leave.

24:34.558 --> 24:35.559
Now.

26:58.803 --> 27:00.905
It's cheaper.
No no no.

27:00.938 --> 27:02.239
We gotta stay warm.

27:02.273 --> 27:03.974
Do you guys need help with
anything?

27:04.008 --> 27:06.143
No, no, we're set.

27:06.177 --> 27:08.245
Come on, we've got to make a
decision.

27:08.279 --> 27:10.181
Okay, let's make a decision.

27:10.214 --> 27:12.817
Actually, that one's not really
reliable.

27:12.850 --> 27:14.885
Those can be really tricky to
install.

27:15.886 --> 27:17.188
We're just browsing.

27:17.221 --> 27:18.856
Really, we're
fine.

28:14.311 --> 28:15.312
Hey!

29:42.199 --> 29:43.901
<i>Yo, there's someone in the
house.</i>

29:54.011 --> 29:55.012
It's fine, it's fine.
Relax.

29:55.045 --> 29:56.380
It's all good, it's alright.
We're all friends.

29:56.413 --> 29:57.214
This is my house!

29:57.248 --> 29:59.149
Hey, chill out!
You're trespassing!

29:59.183 --> 30:00.184
It's cool.

30:00.217 --> 30:02.319
Is this your spot?

30:04.154 --> 30:07.124
Is this your house?

30:07.157 --> 30:12.162
It is now.

30:48.432 --> 30:50.568
Oh come on, you alright?

30:50.602 --> 30:52.870
She's playing.
Uh oh!

30:55.306 --> 30:56.907
No fun, come on.

33:16.246 --> 33:17.247
Hey!

33:18.683 --> 33:20.184
I prefer you didn't do that.

33:23.555 --> 33:25.523
So where does that leave us now,
huh?

33:33.363 --> 33:34.364
Alright.

33:35.500 --> 33:37.535
You want to drop out, you
want to live off the grid,

33:37.569 --> 33:38.570
be a radical.

33:40.170 --> 33:41.539
But I'm telling you,

33:41.573 --> 33:44.374
you can't do it off the
backs of innocent people

33:44.408 --> 33:46.109
who make an honest living.

33:47.144 --> 33:48.345
Carl, where are you?

33:48.378 --> 33:50.113
Yeah I'm coming.

33:50.147 --> 33:51.281
Just heard the raccoons.

33:53.451 --> 33:55.018
Hear me?

33:55.052 --> 33:56.053
Yes sir.

33:59.223 --> 34:00.224
Good luck to you.

34:15.639 --> 34:19.543
Okay, make sure you get
some of that Frito pie then.

34:19.577 --> 34:21.478
Mark, always so lovely to see
you.

34:22.780 --> 34:24.616
Macaroni and cheese.

34:24.649 --> 34:27.784
Alright, good morning, Keith.

34:28.686 --> 34:29.687
Alright.

34:30.588 --> 34:31.556
There you go.

34:31.589 --> 34:32.724
How's Louise, is she good?

34:32.757 --> 34:34.759
I know that she wasn't feeling
right.

34:34.792 --> 34:35.760
It's alright, honey.

34:35.793 --> 34:37.594
Go and get some Frito pie.

34:37.629 --> 34:39.464
Alright, here's a plate for you.

34:45.101 --> 34:47.304
Well look who decided to show
up.

34:48.706 --> 34:49.706
What's your name?

34:51.308 --> 34:52.442
Nola.

34:52.476 --> 34:53.478
Nola.

34:53.511 --> 34:55.713
Oh, god, what a beautiful name.

35:04.221 --> 35:05.623
Mind if I join you?

35:06.891 --> 35:11.228
Oh boy, that was quite a turnout
today.

35:11.261 --> 35:12.262
Did you meet anyone?

35:13.297 --> 35:14.264
A couple people.

35:14.298 --> 35:15.432
That's great.

35:15.466 --> 35:19.202
So, what's your next stop on
your road trip, Miss Nola?

35:24.441 --> 35:27.144
Kinda just let the road
tell me where to go.

35:27.177 --> 35:31.214
Well you can stay here
with us, if you'd like.

35:31.248 --> 35:32.316
We've got a full house,

35:32.349 --> 35:35.319
but there's always room for one
more.

35:35.352 --> 35:36.353
Yeah.

35:40.625 --> 35:41.626
Come on in.

35:43.695 --> 35:46.263
We have the house all
to ourselves tonight.

35:46.296 --> 35:48.600
Brett took the kids to
grammy and grampy's.

35:54.237 --> 35:57.274
Follow me.

35:57.307 --> 35:59.142
Oh I'm frightened of this.

35:59.176 --> 36:00.143
I'm frightened too.

36:00.177 --> 36:00.979
This time, Mickey.

36:01.012 --> 36:06.183
Come on, give me your hand, look
out.

36:08.251 --> 36:10.253
Here, let me do yours.

36:13.791 --> 36:14.792
Here you go.

36:15.693 --> 36:16.694
Yeah.

36:54.297 --> 36:55.933
Everybody in, let's go.

36:55.967 --> 36:57.969
- Hi.
- Hi mom!

36:58.002 --> 36:59.537
Hi mom.
Hi mom.

36:59.570 --> 37:01.906
How was grammy and
grampy's?

37:01.939 --> 37:03.941
- Hi sweetie.
- Backpacks, let's go.

37:03.975 --> 37:06.243
Put your backpacks on.

37:06.276 --> 37:07.512
Okay everybody, this is Nola.

37:07.545 --> 37:09.681
She's gonna be joining
us for dinner tonight.

37:09.714 --> 37:11.214
Hi Nola.

37:11.248 --> 37:12.449
You got what you need,
honey, huh?

37:12.483 --> 37:14.752
How was volleyball, was it good?

37:14.786 --> 37:16.788
Yes.
Oh good.

37:18.422 --> 37:19.857
Bentley, are you alright, hon?

37:21.291 --> 37:22.694
Thank you Lord for this bounty

37:22.727 --> 37:24.762
for which you have provided us
tonight.

37:24.796 --> 37:27.598
And for bringing a new
friend into our home.

37:27.632 --> 37:30.333
Through Christ our Lord, amen.

37:30.367 --> 37:31.368
Amen.

37:32.704 --> 37:33.705
Pass the bread?

37:56.928 --> 38:01.032
So Nola, Marcie was telling
us that you're on a road trip.

38:01.065 --> 38:02.332
That must be exciting.

38:04.401 --> 38:05.770
Yeah.

38:05.803 --> 38:08.338
Are you going all the way to
California?

38:08.371 --> 38:09.306
Maybe.

38:09.339 --> 38:10.808
- Ooh, I want to come.
- Me too,

38:10.842 --> 38:11.876
can I go with you?

38:11.909 --> 38:15.012
Nola, elbows off the table,
please.

38:17.048 --> 38:18.248
Thank you.

38:27.592 --> 38:28.993
I could do that.

39:19.777 --> 39:21.746
So right now we're in gear.

39:21.779 --> 39:24.048
Gonna go to neutral.
Got it.

39:24.081 --> 39:27.384
And then we have to turn
the key, get it started.

39:27.417 --> 39:31.055
So you start to turn it.

39:40.397 --> 39:42.432
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

39:42.466 --> 39:43.968
Get out of the car, Bentley,
now.

39:44.001 --> 39:45.536
I was just teaching him how to
drive.

39:45.570 --> 39:47.071
Are you out of your mind?

39:47.104 --> 39:48.606
Mom, I'm fine.

39:50.875 --> 39:54.512
What you did was reckless,

39:55.580 --> 39:56.514
and it was dangerous.

39:56.547 --> 39:58.616
I learned how to drive
when I was his age.

39:58.649 --> 40:01.752
Don't you ever do that again.

40:53.804 --> 40:56.674
That one looks like an octopus.

40:56.707 --> 40:57.842
See?

40:57.875 --> 40:59.677
Tentacles, and a head.

41:00.711 --> 41:02.747
If you squint a lot, maybe.

41:02.780 --> 41:03.681
Yeah.

41:03.714 --> 41:08.418
You know that a 100-pound
Pacific octopus

41:11.489 --> 41:12.690
can squeeze through a hole

41:12.723 --> 41:14.058
the size of a cherry tomato.

41:16.060 --> 41:17.828
No way.
Yeah, it's true.

41:17.862 --> 41:19.730
I was actually just finishing
reading

41:19.764 --> 41:21.966
about an octopus in Brighton
Aquarium,

41:21.999 --> 41:24.502
and when no one was watching,

41:25.435 --> 41:29.674
it goes, makes its way to
another tank,

41:29.707 --> 41:30.808
eats a lumpfish,

41:31.475 --> 41:33.044
which is an interesting choice

41:33.077 --> 41:34.045
'cause they're not the most

41:34.078 --> 41:35.513
delicious looking thing.

41:36.814 --> 41:38.182
People showed up in the morning.

41:38.215 --> 41:41.452
It was back in its tank.

41:43.621 --> 41:44.622
Escape artist.

41:46.624 --> 41:47.625
Yeah.

41:48.859 --> 41:53.497
Yeah, there's no keeping an
octopus in its tank, apparently.

42:45.850 --> 42:50.821
God damn it!

43:46.177 --> 43:48.646
What's up, little lady?

43:48.679 --> 43:49.647
My van broke down.

43:49.680 --> 43:52.817
It's a 1984 VW Westfalia.

43:52.850 --> 43:54.885
Just on the road outside of
town.

43:56.787 --> 43:59.023
How in the hell did you
get a van like that?

43:59.924 --> 44:00.925
It's mine.

44:04.128 --> 44:05.896
Where'd you leave it?

44:11.102 --> 44:13.170
This is some antique you got
here.

44:13.971 --> 44:17.141
I used to help my uncles
work on their Baja bugs

44:17.174 --> 44:19.844
down in Mexico when I was just a
kid.

44:20.878 --> 44:22.012
So I mean, you know then,

44:22.046 --> 44:23.848
it generally runs just fine.

44:26.851 --> 44:29.386
It definitely breaks
down from time to time,

44:29.420 --> 44:32.756
but this time it just lost all
power

44:32.790 --> 44:34.859
and it wouldn't restart.

44:36.026 --> 44:37.695
Yeah, parts are gonna be hell.

44:40.965 --> 44:42.766
Your fuel lines are 30 years
old,

44:42.800 --> 44:44.001
as far as I can tell.

44:44.034 --> 44:46.070
It's fine, though, right?

44:46.103 --> 44:47.671
It just needs repairs,
not a whole new system.

44:47.705 --> 44:49.807
The fuel lines are cracked and
leaking.

44:50.542 --> 44:52.943
I can't let you get out of here
like that.

44:52.977 --> 44:55.045
Well how much is that gonna
cost?

44:55.079 --> 44:56.947
Let me get you an estimate.

45:03.787 --> 45:08.259
That fuel system is
500, head gasket, 1000,

45:08.292 --> 45:12.062
60 for local tow, hookup fee 75,

45:12.096 --> 45:16.767
and your mileage 15 dollars,
1,650.

45:18.503 --> 45:20.104
I helped.

45:20.137 --> 45:21.138
What's that?

45:22.507 --> 45:23.608
I said I helped.

45:23.642 --> 45:25.876
Do you think maybe we
could split the difference?

45:25.910 --> 45:26.911
I get it.

45:26.944 --> 45:28.045
That's why you kept trying

45:28.078 --> 45:29.847
to grab the tow ropes, huh.

45:29.880 --> 45:31.315
It doesn't work that way, baby.

45:33.751 --> 45:34.752
Thanks.

46:10.788 --> 46:11.989
Excuse me.

46:13.891 --> 46:14.992
Do you know this place?

46:17.428 --> 46:18.862
Get out of here.

46:18.896 --> 46:20.998
I don't care what the shop
manual says.

46:21.031 --> 46:23.234
When it gets hot, I run 60
riding my bike.

46:23.267 --> 46:24.301
Not the 20-50.

46:24.335 --> 46:26.971
I mean, that's what they're
recommending anyway.

46:27.004 --> 46:28.405
Do you know this place?

46:29.440 --> 46:32.376
Holy smoke, look at here.

46:32.409 --> 46:34.479
Mercury Bar.
This is goddamn Mercury Bar.

46:34.512 --> 46:36.180
Let me see this.
Can you see it?

46:36.213 --> 46:37.414
Well we burned some brain
cells in that place.

46:39.883 --> 46:41.418
That guy ran it, remember young
guy,

46:41.453 --> 46:42.520
he's a big charmer, you know.

46:42.554 --> 46:44.955
Was his name, was it Clint?

46:44.989 --> 46:46.458
Heck, I don't know man, he's so
damn tall.

46:46.491 --> 46:48.560
I just called him Shorty.
Shorty, yeah, that works.

46:48.593 --> 46:52.196
Listen, do you remember
anything else about this place?

46:52.229 --> 46:53.897
Go check it out yourself.
It's about three blocks up.

46:53.931 --> 46:55.399
Thanks.

46:55.432 --> 46:58.002
Hey why don't you buy us
a drink before you go?

47:27.499 --> 47:28.866
Possibly some...

47:33.437 --> 47:35.372
Hold on, wait a minute.

47:41.011 --> 47:43.180
What the hell are you doing?

47:44.448 --> 47:46.216
Working for you.

47:46.250 --> 47:48.319
You need the help, and I need
the repairs.

48:26.691 --> 48:28.892
Young lady, are you deaf?

48:30.027 --> 48:32.363
Didn't I tell you to get out of
here?

48:32.396 --> 48:33.364
Am I gonna have to like,

48:33.397 --> 48:35.399
physically throw you?
Miguel!

48:35.432 --> 48:37.234
Hey Lar, I'll be right there.

48:37.267 --> 48:38.969
Your car's out back, alright?

48:41.171 --> 48:43.340
Look, start cleaning
those tools over there.

48:44.975 --> 48:47.545
The brake cleaner and
the rags are underneath.

48:48.445 --> 48:49.446
<i>Get 'em done.</i>

48:57.655 --> 49:00.357
Okay, we're open.

49:00.391 --> 49:03.628
Monday through Friday from 7:00
to 4:00.

49:03.661 --> 49:05.463
Thank you so much.

49:05.497 --> 49:06.897
And you're only staying

49:07.632 --> 49:10.702
'til your parts and the tow are
paid up.

49:10.735 --> 49:11.703
Of course.

49:11.736 --> 49:14.171
And your van is taking up space.

49:14.204 --> 49:16.541
So you're gonna have to pay the
storage.

49:19.677 --> 49:22.446
And every day, you make
sure this is locked.

49:22.480 --> 49:23.481
Got it.

49:29.219 --> 49:30.522
Hey, Cachorro.

49:31.456 --> 49:33.090
Come here, take a look at this.

49:34.091 --> 49:35.092
What did you call me?

49:36.293 --> 49:39.531
Cachorro, you know, a little
runt puppy.

49:45.068 --> 49:46.437
I mean, look at this hunk of
junk.

49:47.605 --> 49:49.039
I bet it still runs fine.

49:49.072 --> 49:50.274
You know, you don't see too many
of these

49:50.307 --> 49:51.308
around these parts.

49:53.310 --> 49:54.311
Who's that?

49:57.448 --> 49:58.616
That's Blue.

49:58.650 --> 50:00.050
That's her real name?

50:00.083 --> 50:02.152
I guess, that's what she goes
by.

50:02.186 --> 50:03.488
I don't pay her no mind.

50:03.521 --> 50:05.757
Just another little Cachorro
like you.

50:05.790 --> 50:09.226
So what, she just hangs out all
day?

50:10.495 --> 50:14.398
Eh, she's not causing any
trouble.

50:14.431 --> 50:16.133
I don't care what she does.

50:17.769 --> 50:19.169
As long as her daddy don't come
around.

50:19.203 --> 50:20.370
That's a piece of work.

50:21.806 --> 50:23.440
She's alright in my book.

50:40.558 --> 50:43.427
Excuse me, how do I get a
library card?

50:43.461 --> 50:44.796
Do I need to fill out an
application?

50:44.829 --> 50:48.165
Oh, we don't make things that
complicated.

50:48.198 --> 50:50.267
I can sign you up right now.

50:50.300 --> 50:51.301
Okay.

51:23.200 --> 51:25.402
Why are you always
hanging out at the garage?

51:27.337 --> 51:28.338
Beats being home.

51:34.411 --> 51:35.813
That's the petrified forest.

51:38.850 --> 51:42.520
In Arizona, the colors
of the rocks are just,

51:42.554 --> 51:44.789
you think there'd be
dinosaurs walking around.

51:48.258 --> 51:50.394
Is that where you're going
when you fix your van?

51:51.261 --> 51:52.262
I don't know.

52:04.174 --> 52:06.811
The library will
be closing in 10 minutes.

52:10.481 --> 52:14.251
Blue?

52:14.284 --> 52:18.221
Blue?

52:18.255 --> 52:19.256
Are you okay?

52:22.426 --> 52:25.830
Blue.

52:38.543 --> 52:39.544
I'm sorry.

52:42.279 --> 52:43.881
Is it your first time?

52:43.915 --> 52:46.451
No, I just don't
have anything with me.

52:48.385 --> 52:49.787
Here, just take my jacket.

52:49.821 --> 52:51.889
Tie it around your waist for
now.

52:51.923 --> 52:54.391
I have stuff in my van if we
walk back.

52:54.424 --> 52:56.426
Okay, thank you.

53:33.765 --> 53:35.733
I thought all home-schoolers

53:35.767 --> 53:37.334
were hippies or Jesus freaks.

53:38.168 --> 53:40.471
Yeah, well that's not
why I was homeschooled.

53:41.304 --> 53:43.373
It's because the state of
education

53:43.407 --> 53:44.909
in the US is in shambles.

53:45.743 --> 53:48.846
It's been in this deep
crisis since the 1950s.

53:50.280 --> 53:51.281
I had the best education in the
world,

53:51.314 --> 53:53.350
and it didn't cost a dime.

53:53.383 --> 53:55.486
Yeah, well my school is free
too.

53:55.520 --> 53:56.521
Public school.

53:57.522 --> 54:00.958
Oh, even if I wanted to
do, it'd be impossible,

54:00.992 --> 54:02.527
'cause I never went.

54:03.494 --> 54:05.262
And your mom was okay with that?

54:07.598 --> 54:08.599
I don't have one.

54:10.935 --> 54:11.969
Everyone has a mom.

54:13.671 --> 54:14.906
At least in the beginning.

54:16.641 --> 54:17.975
Mine died when I was 10.

54:20.377 --> 54:21.746
I'm sorry.

54:21.779 --> 54:22.780
It's okay.

54:24.582 --> 54:25.616
She never stood up to my dad

54:25.650 --> 54:26.951
when she was alive, anyways.

54:30.488 --> 54:31.589
What happened to yours?

54:32.657 --> 54:33.658
I don't know.

54:34.391 --> 54:35.392
What do you mean?

54:36.994 --> 54:39.797
I mean I don't know where she
went.

54:42.365 --> 54:43.568
And you never wondered?

54:44.802 --> 54:45.903
No, I did.

54:48.371 --> 54:49.372
I still do.

54:50.508 --> 54:54.479
And I tried to look for
her, but I never found her.

55:01.886 --> 55:03.921
You know what, scorch and
scatter me when I'm gone.

55:03.955 --> 55:06.557
Yeah, put me in a pepper
grinder,

55:06.591 --> 55:09.527
and sprinkle me over all the
people

55:09.560 --> 55:10.762
that pissed me off.

55:12.029 --> 55:13.296
Here's a little Miguel,

55:13.330 --> 55:15.032
here's a little Miguel for you.

55:16.801 --> 55:18.469
There's a lot of Miguel for you.

55:20.605 --> 55:22.740
Yeah, okay.

55:22.774 --> 55:24.642
Let me know when the
funeral arrangements are.

55:24.675 --> 55:26.343
Alright, bye.

55:36.721 --> 55:38.355
Are you okay?

55:38.388 --> 55:39.389
Yeah.

55:40.558 --> 55:41.559
My cousin Ronnie.

55:43.094 --> 55:44.294
I'm sorry.

55:45.930 --> 55:49.467
We always talked about
being here in America.

55:49.500 --> 55:51.669
We planned on opening
up this shop together.

55:54.572 --> 55:55.573
What happened?

55:58.042 --> 56:00.077
I made it across, he didn't.

56:06.416 --> 56:08.486
You know, for the next project,

56:08.519 --> 56:10.888
you can clean out the store room
upstairs.

56:10.922 --> 56:12.322
Sure, okay.

56:13.591 --> 56:16.694
And, if you like it,

56:18.162 --> 56:19.831
you can go ahead and move in
there.

56:21.098 --> 56:24.602
No, I'll be okay.

56:26.671 --> 56:28.673
The good thing about the storage
room,

56:29.607 --> 56:31.676
is there's heat up there.

56:53.831 --> 56:56.567
Alright let's go, tighten it up.

56:57.301 --> 57:00.605
I'm not a runaway, if
that's what you think.

57:00.638 --> 57:02.439
Well, that's none of my
business.

57:10.014 --> 57:12.483
That's it, pretty good.

57:15.987 --> 57:18.789
You'll let me know when you
get back on the road, right?

57:20.458 --> 57:22.059
Not anytime soon.

57:22.093 --> 57:24.896
I paid off the parts, but I
still have the labor to go.

57:27.732 --> 57:29.567
Have you ever been to Navajo
Nation?

57:30.801 --> 57:32.937
No.

57:32.970 --> 57:34.505
Well my aunt lives there.

57:34.538 --> 57:35.539
She's on the res.

57:41.045 --> 57:43.446
You know, I can't take
you with me, though.

57:44.982 --> 57:46.784
I can't live with my dad
anymore.

57:49.687 --> 57:50.955
At least you have a dad.

58:40.004 --> 58:41.605
Was that your dad?

58:41.639 --> 58:43.040
This is nothing.

58:44.608 --> 58:45.609
Come on.

58:58.723 --> 59:00.791
I just know that she left when I
was born.

59:03.327 --> 59:04.528
What happened?

59:07.298 --> 59:09.000
It was always this big secret.

59:10.301 --> 59:13.004
Clint, my dad, he never
really went into it.

59:14.171 --> 59:16.507
He said it was better that I
didn't know.

59:18.275 --> 59:19.276
I don't think so.

59:19.977 --> 59:21.846
All I knew was her first name.

59:24.181 --> 59:25.182
Cheryl.

59:27.852 --> 59:30.121
And I guess Frankel,
which is my last name,

59:30.154 --> 59:33.791
but who knows if she ever took
his name?

59:34.792 --> 59:36.894
Maybe she remarried.

59:39.230 --> 59:41.098
Or she could be dead.

59:45.803 --> 59:47.638
So, all I have is this.

59:49.740 --> 59:51.675
You don't have an address or
anything?

59:51.709 --> 59:53.677
No, nothing.

59:55.012 --> 59:56.313
Do you have a credit card?

59:59.016 --> 01:00:03.054
Fan belt, plugs.

01:00:16.233 --> 01:00:17.234
Try your dad.

01:00:29.146 --> 01:00:30.147
That's him.

01:00:39.123 --> 01:00:40.124
How'd you get it?

01:00:41.425 --> 01:00:42.726
Don't worry about it.

01:01:00.177 --> 01:01:01.378
I guess she's still here.

01:01:12.790 --> 01:01:13.824
- Hey.
- Hey!

01:01:16.026 --> 01:01:18.329
What's up?

01:01:18.362 --> 01:01:19.363
What's going on?

01:01:20.331 --> 01:01:21.799
You know it's been a month.

01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:24.735
I didn't think it was possible,

01:01:24.768 --> 01:01:27.671
but I tallied up all your hours.

01:01:27.705 --> 01:01:28.706
Really?
Yeah.

01:01:30.941 --> 01:01:33.777
Today, you're all checked out!

01:01:42.753 --> 01:01:43.821
What is this stripe?

01:01:43.854 --> 01:01:45.990
I didn't think it was gonna
survive the operation,

01:01:46.023 --> 01:01:50.861
but the mighty Hulk
will live to ride again.

01:01:52.497 --> 01:01:54.265
Why did you paint it?

01:01:55.065 --> 01:01:56.333
Oh, you don't got to worry about
it.

01:01:56.367 --> 01:01:57.968
We're all squared up.

01:01:59.170 --> 01:02:01.372
What made you think you had the
right?

01:02:03.207 --> 01:02:04.742
Hey now.

01:02:04.775 --> 01:02:05.743
This is my van.

01:02:05.776 --> 01:02:07.278
I've repaid all my debts.

01:02:07.311 --> 01:02:09.413
I put a roof over your head.

01:02:09.446 --> 01:02:10.781
I've been taking care of you.

01:02:10.814 --> 01:02:12.484
I even fixed your old jalopy.

01:02:12.517 --> 01:02:13.751
I could have fixed it myself,

01:02:13.784 --> 01:02:15.119
you didn't have to touch it.

01:03:41.905 --> 01:03:44.008
Welcome, have a seat anywhere
you'd like.

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:58.355
Sure I can't get you any pie?

01:04:05.029 --> 01:04:06.363
Sorry, we're a little
short-staffed.

01:04:06.397 --> 01:04:08.065
Can I get you anything?

01:04:13.037 --> 01:04:15.339
I'll just take a
glass of water, thanks.

01:04:16.541 --> 01:04:17.542
What?

01:04:19.176 --> 01:04:23.881
I'll take some coffee?
Coffee, got it.

01:04:29.286 --> 01:04:30.287
There you go.

01:04:43.334 --> 01:04:45.069
Well, we made it
through the day, Cheryl.

01:04:45.102 --> 01:04:47.204
Yeah, I'll see you
tomorrow.

01:04:47.237 --> 01:04:48.238
Goodnight.

01:05:18.102 --> 01:05:19.103
Hey!

01:05:34.652 --> 01:05:35.653
Where is he?

01:06:04.348 --> 01:06:06.383
So when did you open your diner?

01:06:09.386 --> 01:06:11.255
It'll be 12 years next month.

01:06:16.126 --> 01:06:17.127
Do you like it?

01:06:20.030 --> 01:06:22.332
It has its ups and downs.

01:06:22.366 --> 01:06:23.535
It's a tough business.

01:06:26.738 --> 01:06:29.306
Like when you and Clint had
Mercury Bar.

01:06:33.010 --> 01:06:35.212
That was a whole other ball
game.

01:06:35.245 --> 01:06:36.614
What do you mean?

01:06:36.648 --> 01:06:40.284
We didn't see eye to eye
when it came to business.

01:06:40.317 --> 01:06:41.586
So that's when you sold
everything

01:06:41.619 --> 01:06:43.387
and just decided to live on the
road?

01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:46.290
No, the bar went under, when we
had you.

01:06:47.592 --> 01:06:49.226
We got the van to drive out to
New Orleans

01:06:49.259 --> 01:06:50.427
to open up a new place.

01:07:01.405 --> 01:07:03.440
I installed this whole stove.

01:07:03.475 --> 01:07:04.476
You did?

01:07:15.419 --> 01:07:17.020
You came out with a Mohawk.

01:07:18.288 --> 01:07:20.725
Just a shock of white blonde
hair.

01:07:21.626 --> 01:07:23.393
Clint was sure that you'd have
his hair,

01:07:23.427 --> 01:07:25.295
but you didn't.

01:07:25.964 --> 01:07:27.699
I thought you'd have blue eyes.

01:07:28.566 --> 01:07:30.067
Yeah, mine are more green.

01:07:31.401 --> 01:07:33.203
You got your blue eyes from my
mom.

01:07:34.672 --> 01:07:37.509
You're his kid, though,
through and through.

01:07:39.644 --> 01:07:43.815
Do you think if Clint didn't
want to live in the Hulk,

01:07:43.848 --> 01:07:48.385
then we would've been a family
in a home?

01:07:51.789 --> 01:07:53.290
I don't know how to answer that.

01:07:57.361 --> 01:07:59.597
Would you like to stay with me
now?

01:08:03.501 --> 01:08:04.502
For the time being.

01:08:17.881 --> 01:08:19.349
Where are you going?

01:08:20.350 --> 01:08:21.786
To the diner.

01:08:21.819 --> 01:08:23.488
I can go with you.
No no no.

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:25.122
I gotta get going, I'm sorry.

01:09:13.604 --> 01:09:14.404
Don't worry about money.

01:09:14.438 --> 01:09:16.707
The best things in life are
free.

01:09:17.774 --> 01:09:18.743
Yeah right.

01:09:18.776 --> 01:09:19.644
May as well have said,

01:09:19.676 --> 01:09:21.746
"I can't help you, I'm just a
cookie."

01:09:22.947 --> 01:09:24.515
Let me open yours.

01:09:29.353 --> 01:09:32.356
You will always have good
luck in your personal affairs.

01:09:34.191 --> 01:09:35.192
I'll take it.

01:09:36.359 --> 01:09:37.462
What did you do today?

01:09:39.564 --> 01:09:40.631
Just kinda hung out.

01:09:43.468 --> 01:09:44.801
I should've left you my keys,
I'm sorry.

01:09:44.836 --> 01:09:46.470
I didn't think about it
'til I was driving home.

01:09:46.504 --> 01:09:47.505
No it's fine.

01:09:48.506 --> 01:09:51.509
I actually was starting
to look into schools.

01:09:51.542 --> 01:09:52.542
Schools?

01:09:53.611 --> 01:09:54.912
Like, college.

01:10:01.686 --> 01:10:03.655
About time I got out of that
cookie.

01:10:03.688 --> 01:10:07.458
It does not say that, let me
see.

01:10:07.492 --> 01:10:09.961
You will live a long prosperous
life.

01:10:09.994 --> 01:10:11.796
That's a good one.

01:10:11.829 --> 01:10:16.834
Yeah.

01:10:19.403 --> 01:10:22.974
Here you go.

01:10:32.349 --> 01:10:33.818
Hey.
Hey.

01:10:33.851 --> 01:10:36.688
What are you doing here?

01:10:36.721 --> 01:10:38.589
I just thought I would come say
hi.

01:10:40.357 --> 01:10:41.726
Hello again.

01:10:41.759 --> 01:10:42.994
This is Nola.

01:10:43.027 --> 01:10:44.428
I remember you from the other
night.

01:10:44.462 --> 01:10:46.363
How do you two know each other?

01:10:46.396 --> 01:10:47.699
My niece.

01:10:47.732 --> 01:10:49.734
She's visiting from out of town.

01:10:49.767 --> 01:10:50.768
Oh.

01:10:53.303 --> 01:10:54.572
I'll see you back at home?

01:10:54.605 --> 01:10:55.606
What time?

01:10:56.474 --> 01:10:57.441
I just, I don't know.

01:10:57.475 --> 01:10:58.308
The fridge broke down again.

01:10:58.341 --> 01:10:59.844
I'm waiting for the guy to come
fix it.

01:11:01.311 --> 01:11:02.312
Great.

01:11:16.527 --> 01:11:18.328
The crime
rate in this country

01:11:18.361 --> 01:11:20.598
has been declining for the
first time in 15 years.

01:11:28.072 --> 01:11:30.007
Today was a hell of a day.

01:11:31.576 --> 01:11:32.577
I made us dinner.

01:11:43.521 --> 01:11:45.590
I can't catch a break in this
damn place.

01:11:45.623 --> 01:11:47.290
What happened?

01:11:47.324 --> 01:11:48.726
Just about a million things.

01:11:49.727 --> 01:11:50.928
Comes with the territory.

01:11:52.697 --> 01:11:53.631
We had a fire a while back

01:11:53.664 --> 01:11:55.533
that we're still trying
to bounce back from,

01:11:55.566 --> 01:11:56.968
then I found out one of the
waitresses

01:11:57.001 --> 01:11:58.401
was skimming off the top.

01:11:59.470 --> 01:12:00.671
Now the fridge.

01:12:00.705 --> 01:12:02.640
I mean, I could come
and help, if you want.

01:12:02.673 --> 01:12:04.441
Oh no, no sweetie.

01:12:06.376 --> 01:12:08.880
It's nothing crazy, but all at
once,

01:12:08.913 --> 01:12:09.914
it feels like a lot.

01:12:12.049 --> 01:12:13.383
You know, I was thinking about
something

01:12:13.416 --> 01:12:15.352
that I wanted to talk to you
about.

01:12:15.385 --> 01:12:16.286
Okay.

01:12:16.319 --> 01:12:18.421
I think it's time for me to sell
The Hulk.

01:12:19.690 --> 01:12:21.526
Why would you do that?

01:12:21.559 --> 01:12:22.693
Because I need the money,

01:12:22.727 --> 01:12:25.395
and if I was seriously thinking
about

01:12:25.428 --> 01:12:26.564
looking at schools and things
like that...

01:12:26.597 --> 01:12:29.634
Well I doubt you could get
very much for it, honestly.

01:12:33.771 --> 01:12:36.941
I'm sure it's worth something.

01:12:37.742 --> 01:12:40.443
I can try to sell it for you
this weekend.

01:12:40.478 --> 01:12:42.445
I know the guy who owns the used
car lot.

01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:45.116
I'm sure he'll give you
a fair price for it.

01:13:21.986 --> 01:13:22.987
Well.

01:13:25.656 --> 01:13:27.825
You want to guess how
much I was able to get?

01:13:27.859 --> 01:13:29.460
Tell me.

01:13:29.493 --> 01:13:32.129
Honestly, it's
such a piece of junk.

01:13:32.163 --> 01:13:34.632
I thought he was gonna
laugh me off the lot.

01:13:34.665 --> 01:13:36.834
You know, they're really built
to last.

01:13:36.868 --> 01:13:39.103
I mean, if the right person
knows how to take care of it,

01:13:39.136 --> 01:13:40.938
they'll run forever.

01:13:40.972 --> 01:13:43.574
I'm pretty sure he just
bought it for parts,

01:13:43.608 --> 01:13:46.644
but regardless, here's your big
pay day.

01:13:50.982 --> 01:13:53.551
$7,000 dollars.

01:13:54.619 --> 01:13:55.786
I know, right?

01:13:58.956 --> 01:14:00.057
Let's go out tonight.

01:14:02.493 --> 01:14:03.527
To new beginnings.

01:14:05.029 --> 01:14:06.030
Alright.

01:14:09.967 --> 01:14:11.736
This place is really really
nice.

01:14:21.812 --> 01:14:23.014
You look pretty.

01:14:24.916 --> 01:14:26.651
Thank you, that's sweet of you.

01:14:27.718 --> 01:14:29.120
You look pretty cute yourself.

01:14:34.158 --> 01:14:36.027
It'd look good on you.

01:14:51.876 --> 01:14:52.843
That's good.

01:14:52.877 --> 01:14:54.578
You put your lips together.

01:14:55.179 --> 01:14:58.883
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

01:14:58.916 --> 01:15:01.819
Ladies, what can
I get for you to start?

01:15:01.852 --> 01:15:02.853
I'll have a Diet Coke.

01:15:02.887 --> 01:15:03.854
Certainly.

01:15:03.888 --> 01:15:04.722
Light on the ice, please.

01:15:04.755 --> 01:15:06.157
Light on the ice, and
for you?

01:15:06.190 --> 01:15:08.559
I'll have one too, no ice.

01:15:08.592 --> 01:15:09.560
No ice.

01:15:09.593 --> 01:15:10.594
Be back in a second.

01:15:14.031 --> 01:15:15.666
How's your steak?

01:15:16.434 --> 01:15:18.836
It's really good.
Can I have a bite?

01:15:18.869 --> 01:15:19.870
Yeah.

01:15:28.646 --> 01:15:32.283
Mm, mm, I love a night off.

01:15:32.316 --> 01:15:33.651
It was such a good idea.

01:15:36.954 --> 01:15:39.156
So did you ever meet anyone
after Clint?

01:15:41.225 --> 01:15:44.228
You know, there were a few
guys who came and went.

01:15:45.129 --> 01:15:46.230
I work all the time.

01:15:46.263 --> 01:15:47.531
It's hard to make anything
stick.

01:15:47.565 --> 01:15:48.833
So many jerks.

01:15:48.866 --> 01:15:50.735
And the good ones always wanted
kids.

01:15:53.938 --> 01:15:55.239
And you never wanted kids?

01:15:56.707 --> 01:15:57.742
It's a whole thing.

01:15:59.677 --> 01:16:01.178
Let's not get into that tonight.

01:16:03.748 --> 01:16:05.149
They got the fries right here.

01:16:12.623 --> 01:16:15.926
If I had a baby, I would've
never left.

01:16:16.894 --> 01:16:22.099
You know Clint's the one
who wanted to be a parent.

01:16:23.734 --> 01:16:24.735
Not me.

01:16:37.014 --> 01:16:39.750
You're alive because I left.

01:16:43.687 --> 01:16:46.357
We were broke, you know.

01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:47.591
We were drunk.

01:16:48.692 --> 01:16:50.861
Neither of us was in any
state to be raising a child.

01:16:50.895 --> 01:16:52.096
Clint never drank.

01:16:52.129 --> 01:16:54.999
I can't imagine Clint drinking
ever.

01:16:55.032 --> 01:16:56.233
We were real messed up.

01:16:58.702 --> 01:16:59.770
And I was depressed.

01:17:07.178 --> 01:17:08.179
He came to me,

01:17:09.947 --> 01:17:13.117
and he said he'd rather
raise you all by himself.

01:17:14.051 --> 01:17:17.254
And at the time, that
seemed like a good idea.

01:17:19.390 --> 01:17:22.726
So I let you go, and...

01:17:36.173 --> 01:17:39.276
Ladies, how are we doing?
Just the check, please.

01:17:39.310 --> 01:17:40.311
Okay.

01:18:18.115 --> 01:18:20.284
Looking to buy a car today?

01:18:20.317 --> 01:18:21.852
Looking for a van, actually.

01:18:21.886 --> 01:18:24.021
Alrighty, I'm Randy.

01:18:24.054 --> 01:18:25.089
Let's go over here.

01:18:26.790 --> 01:18:28.058
This is a classic.

01:18:28.092 --> 01:18:31.262
Complete with a bed, a full
kitchen,

01:18:31.295 --> 01:18:33.397
and a pop-up roof to boot.

01:18:34.965 --> 01:18:35.933
How much?

01:18:35.966 --> 01:18:36.901
You're in luck.

01:18:36.934 --> 01:18:39.870
My manager is in a very
generous mood today

01:18:39.904 --> 01:18:40.938
and he told me,

01:18:40.971 --> 01:18:44.808
"Get this thing off the
lot for $10,000 dollars."

01:18:44.842 --> 01:18:46.777
Don't vans like this
break down all the time?

01:18:46.810 --> 01:18:48.913
We need something that's
reliable.

01:18:48.946 --> 01:18:50.047
I'll tell you what.

01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:54.018
Just for you, $9,000 dollars.

01:18:54.051 --> 01:18:57.154
Look, it has to come with
a warranty too, right?

01:18:57.188 --> 01:18:58.989
That's worth something, I'm
sure.

01:18:59.023 --> 01:19:01.425
Must shave off a couple hundred
at least.

01:19:01.459 --> 01:19:03.761
Well if you're willing to take
that risk.

01:19:05.296 --> 01:19:08.032
Let me talk to my manager
and see what we can do.

01:19:08.065 --> 01:19:09.066
Great.

01:19:11.503 --> 01:19:12.703
I'll be here.

01:19:35.993 --> 01:19:37.795
Hey, what can I do for you
today?

01:19:39.129 --> 01:19:40.998
Do you have any idea how hard it
is

01:19:41.031 --> 01:19:44.001
to replace a main seal
on one of these old vans?

01:19:44.034 --> 01:19:46.270
This one definitely has
a rear main seal leak.

01:19:47.371 --> 01:19:49.139
It's the hardest thing to
replace.

01:19:51.909 --> 01:19:53.344
We didn't check for this?

01:19:53.377 --> 01:19:55.446
You knew these things leak oil
like crazy.

01:21:04.048 --> 01:21:05.416
Well the fire
we reported

01:21:05.449 --> 01:21:07.418
at the old fire hole is still
burning

01:21:07.452 --> 01:21:08.919
out of control...

01:21:26.036 --> 01:21:27.037
Oh dad.

01:22:59.430 --> 01:23:02.166
I wasn't planning on taking off
like that.

01:23:02.199 --> 01:23:03.568
You're all squared up here.

01:23:06.604 --> 01:23:09.373
I was planning on you taking
over the shop some day.

01:23:11.241 --> 01:23:12.309
But who am I kidding?

01:23:12.342 --> 01:23:14.679
I ain't going nowhere.

01:23:17.381 --> 01:23:18.616
Thanks for taking me in.

01:23:19.551 --> 01:23:21.453
Door is always open, Cachorro.

01:23:33.731 --> 01:23:35.533
How far is your aunt's?

01:23:35.567 --> 01:23:37.367
It's a eight our bus ride.

01:23:39.203 --> 01:23:40.337
But you know the way?

01:23:41.371 --> 01:23:42.372
Of course.

01:23:46.511 --> 01:23:48.546
It's a lot bigger in here

01:23:48.580 --> 01:23:50.682
that for what it looks
like on the outside.

01:23:53.785 --> 01:23:56.286
I think it's cool that
you grew up this way.

01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:58.556
Clint would always call
the window of The Hulk

01:23:58.590 --> 01:24:00.492
my TV when I was little.

01:24:00.525 --> 01:24:01.726
I mean, I wanted the
ones that you would see

01:24:01.759 --> 01:24:03.595
at the laundromat, but
he would always say,

01:24:03.628 --> 01:24:06.029
"Just turn on the TV if you get
bored."

01:24:07.632 --> 01:24:10.334
So I sit there and watch
everything go by.

01:24:15.172 --> 01:24:16.373
There's only one channel.

01:24:18.308 --> 01:24:20.077
Did you end up finding your mom?

01:24:21.513 --> 01:24:22.514
Yeah.

01:24:24.616 --> 01:24:26.416
She wasn't what I expected.

01:24:27.417 --> 01:24:28.385
Sorry.

01:24:28.418 --> 01:24:29.419
Don't be sorry.

01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:31.221
I wanted to know.

01:24:32.624 --> 01:24:33.625
Now I know.

01:24:34.692 --> 01:24:37.795
I think that you can have
your biological family,

01:24:40.430 --> 01:24:41.699
but also sometimes you can have

01:24:41.733 --> 01:24:43.100
your logical family too.

01:25:39.691 --> 01:25:41.358
Thanks for the ride.

01:25:41.391 --> 01:25:44.294
It's been nice being back
on the road with somebody.

01:25:44.328 --> 01:25:45.329
Keep in touch.

01:25:45.930 --> 01:25:46.898
Definitely.

01:25:46.931 --> 01:25:48.633
Here.

01:25:49.132 --> 01:25:52.202
Write to me first, and
then give me an address

01:25:52.235 --> 01:25:54.772
so we know where to write back.

01:27:35.006 --> 01:27:36.674
Nice van.

01:27:36.708 --> 01:27:37.709
Thanks, yours too.

01:27:38.643 --> 01:27:39.677
She's all excited.

01:27:39.711 --> 01:27:41.979
She thought maybe you were
going to the camp out.

01:27:42.013 --> 01:27:42.980
Is that where you're headed?

01:27:43.014 --> 01:27:44.782
What is it?

01:27:44.816 --> 01:27:46.249
The big van gathering.

01:27:47.552 --> 01:27:48.553
Where?
