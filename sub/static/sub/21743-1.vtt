He chose it himself.
It fits perfectly. No sizing needed.

00:54.614 --> 00:56.453
That's a sign,
right?

01:00.541 --> 01:02.240
- Ros.
- Hm?

01:02.588 --> 01:04.001
Thank you.

01:04.169 --> 01:06.424
Hey,
did you download the app yet?

01:06.998 --> 01:08.475
You should!

01:35.496 --> 01:37.339
- She hit the ball!
- Shut up!

01:37.452 --> 01:39.119
At last!

01:54.411 --> 01:56.358
It's Mum.

02:29.573 --> 02:31.425
What's that?

02:32.382 --> 02:33.957
An invitation.

02:34.441 --> 02:35.874
To what?

02:38.182 --> 02:40.021
Tom...

02:41.195 --> 02:43.507
- Who's it from?
- Dad.

02:43.734 --> 02:45.438
They're coming back.

02:50.740 --> 02:52.609
Why didn't they tell us?

02:55.613 --> 02:57.179
It's OK.

02:59.740 --> 03:01.674
It'll be OK.

It's Max and Issie.
Don't worry, no-one's grooming me.

04:57.467 --> 05:00.772
Except Max, cos he wants me
to do his physics homework.

05:03.465 --> 05:05.214
Done.

05:08.694 --> 05:12.104
It could be good,
Dad being closer.

05:23.099 --> 05:24.253
I'm not going.

05:24.301 --> 05:27.830

Are you surprised

Wondering if I kept money from
you in the divorce? I didn't.

11:32.230 --> 11:34.302
I promise I was completely honest.

11:34.583 --> 11:37.887
This is simply a change of circumstance.

11:39.763 --> 11:41.356
You didn't need to come here
in person.

11:41.404 --> 11:42.684
You know
what The Acres is like.

11:42.732 --> 11:45.607
You didn't need to get out,
walk around...

11:45.987 --> 11:47.744
walk in.

11:50.475 --> 11:54.287
Must've been another reason
why you came.

11:56.943 --> 11:58.370
- How are you?
- Good.

11:58.417 --> 11:59.761
- Good.
- You seem well.

11:59.893 --> 12:01.209
Yeah, I am.

12:01.936 --> 12:04.201
- Do you think about me?
- What?

12:04.318 --> 12:07.451
You can't end 15 years of marriage
and just switch it off, can you?

12:07.698 --> 12:09.631
I even dream about you sometimes.

12:10.638 --> 12:13.475
Just being honest.
Whatyou always asked for.

12:13.647 --> 12:15.643
I thought you were doing
all right in London.

12:15.690 --> 12:18.248
Doing all right financially,
but Tom's here

12:18.311 --> 12:21.436
and I know you've not seen
us together since it happened,

12:21.491 --> 12:25.232
but... whatever he goes back and
tells you, we get on quite well.

12:25.318 --> 12:27.959
- He makes an effort.
- Yeah, well, I'd like to see more of him

12:28.076 --> 12:29.911
and Kate's friends are here,
her family.

12:29.959 --> 12:31.344
It's clearly the best thing to do.

12:31.392 --> 12:34.084
No, the difficult thing was
leaving in the first place.

12:34.258 --> 12:38.834
But that was the right thing
at the time, wasn't it, for you?

12:38.982 --> 12:42.514
- You decided to go.
- Yes, we did, to give you space.

12:42.693 --> 12:44.990
But hopefully two years is enough.

12:48.148 --> 12:49.787
Yorkshire Tea.

12:50.092 --> 12:52.097
Like we used to get.

12:53.592 --> 12:54.873
Milk, one sugar?

12:54.998 --> 12:56.204
Yeah.

12:56.270 --> 12:59.984
It's odd knowing someone so well,
isn't it, that you never see?

13:00.068 --> 13:01.850
Maybe not so well any more.

13:02.053 --> 13:03.701
Got the tea right.

13:04.123 --> 13:06.170
Is Tom coming to the party?

13:07.529 --> 13:10.670
Gemma, you're very quiet.
We haven't spoken to each other

13:10.732 --> 13:12.833
in a long time and you've
hardly opened your mouth.

13:12.880 --> 13:15.264
- Tom has another party at the weekend.
- He...

13:15.443 --> 13:18.295
Gemma, he's 15 and he's
what, too busy? I'm his dad.

13:18.399 --> 13:19.662
It's up to him.

13:19.842 --> 13:21.162
Is that a new top?

13:21.311 --> 13:23.389
- What?
- No.

13:23.488 --> 13:26.071
No. It's our wedding,
our house-warming.

13:26.231 --> 13:29.239
Sure, he's under your roof,
but he's part of our family too.

13:29.298 --> 13:30.631
Actually,
I did encourage him,

13:30.679 --> 13:34.006
but he felt very strongly
that it would be awful.

13:35.381 --> 13:37.303
- Tell him he has to.
- He's not a child.

13:37.350 --> 13:40.213
He is and, like you,
used to say, family first.

13:40.260 --> 13:42.871
That depends on
how you define "family".

13:46.168 --> 13:48.543
Are you with anyone at the moment?
Is there anyone new?

13:48.620 --> 13:51.520
- I might leave the tea.
- I hear not.

13:51.793 --> 13:52.981
Bad taste.

13:53.029 --> 13:54.824
Because it's odd that you're here.

13:55.207 --> 13:56.871
I send you that text out
of courtesy

13:56.981 --> 13:59.168
and within 24 hours I
find you poking around.

13:59.216 --> 14:00.317
That's strange.

14:00.365 --> 14:02.840
And forgive me but I've
seen some of our friends

14:02.898 --> 14:06.332
while I've been sorting this place
out and they say you just... work,

14:06.380 --> 14:10.808
go home, work again, only see your
little group. Nothing's changed.

14:10.856 --> 14:12.152
- I need to go...
- Your same life

14:12.199 --> 14:13.493
- ..before you get any more aggressive.
- But without me.

14:13.540 --> 14:14.688
I'm not being aggressive at all.

14:14.736 --> 14:16.349
You remeber, the last time we were
in a room together,

14:16.396 --> 14:17.691
you knocked me unconscious.

14:17.752 --> 14:20.715
Yes, and I've got a criminal record.

14:20.854 --> 14:22.735
I did community service.

14:22.930 --> 14:25.606
Everyone I know, when they
found out about what I'd done,

14:25.668 --> 14:26.777
took a step back.

14:26.832 --> 14:29.309
I've invited friends to the
party. It'll be a miracle if,

14:29.357 --> 14:31.280
with my reputation,
anybody turns up,

14:31.500 --> 14:33.291
but at least I'm trying to move on.

14:33.338 --> 14:35.137
I think that's what you need to do.

14:36.344 --> 14:39.518
Not being patronising,
but leave me behind.

14:40.706 --> 14:42.815
Of course we think about
each other sometimes,

14:42.863 --> 14:44.908
but turning up at my house? Come on.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.728
You even look the same. The car.

14:46.776 --> 14:51.088
And you're right, that top, how old
is that top? You had it when we...

14:51.846 --> 14:53.221
OK.

14:53.939 --> 14:55.784
Tell Tom he should be there.

15:56.128 --> 15:58.643
Hey. Cutting it fine.

15:58.690 --> 15:59.838
Sorry?

15:59.926 --> 16:02.627
Well, it's nearly time.
Oh, do you want a hand?

16:02.807 --> 16:04.369
Thanks. I'm fine.

16:04.463 --> 16:07.932
Maybe it's just me but I hate
rushing so I always get here early,

16:08.029 --> 16:11.592
order a coffee from the van on the corner.
Have you tried their coffee?

16:11.640 --> 16:13.588
- It's been there years.
- It's a lovely man that runs it.

16:13.635 --> 16:15.729
- Tony.
- Toni, I think.

16:15.940 --> 16:17.271
That's what I said.

16:17.318 --> 16:19.991
Yeah, he's Italian.
It's Toni with an "I"?

16:20.682 --> 16:22.808
I had to sort my son out
this morning.

16:22.940 --> 16:26.047
Oh, even more important to be
organised with family around.

16:27.212 --> 16:29.697
Thanks, I'll remember that.

16:32.496 --> 16:35.158
- All right?
- Yes I'm fine.

16:37.590 --> 16:39.298
No, actually.

16:42.430 --> 16:45.019
Simon's moved back to Parminster.

16:46.221 --> 16:48.924
He's invited Tom to
a house-warming party.

16:50.182 --> 16:52.900
- You don't seem surprised.
- Well, it's only a matter of time.

16:53.009 --> 16:54.671
He hates London,
always said it.

16:54.719 --> 16:57.046
It doesn't need to affect you, though.

16:57.927 --> 17:01.092
- Have you tried that app yet?
- I don't think it's my thing.

17:01.322 --> 17:05.099
That's because you haven't tried
it. It worked for me. Gemma, come on.

17:05.252 --> 17:07.946
Do you really think you're going
to bump into somebody at random?

17:08.592 --> 17:10.549
Never happens.

17:14.007 --> 17:15.807
Deep breath.

17:18.665 --> 17:20.557
Thanks.

17:21.885 --> 17:24.243
Erm, tell me if any of this hurts.

17:25.643 --> 17:27.151
Do you exercise regularly?

17:27.213 --> 17:28.721
Squash, tennis,
a bit of football.

17:28.769 --> 17:31.775
- Right, so this could be a strain.
- That's what I thought. Aah!

17:31.823 --> 17:33.002
- There it is. Found it.
- There?

17:33.049 --> 17:34.406
No, no... Aah!

17:34.827 --> 17:37.310
That... That's worse. Wow.

17:37.528 --> 17:40.400
- You don't take prisoners.
- Sorry.

17:40.721 --> 17:42.606
That's no problem.

17:43.347 --> 17:45.516
You must be in the gym quite a bit.

17:46.643 --> 17:48.220
- Sorry?
- Exercise.

17:48.876 --> 17:51.036
To stay in shape like that
when you're in here all day.

17:51.408 --> 17:52.860
Not the gym.

17:53.166 --> 17:55.322
This and that. I manage.

17:55.479 --> 17:57.426
This and that?

17:58.643 --> 18:00.482
Erm...

18:01.713 --> 18:04.350
this looks like you've
just strained a muscle.

18:04.525 --> 18:07.612
It should get better in a couple
of weeks and in the meantime...

18:07.916 --> 18:10.176
- ease off the exercise.
- Thanks.

18:14.916 --> 18:16.759
You probably don't get much time for lunch.

18:16.831 --> 18:17.978
20 minutes.

18:18.056 --> 18:19.836
Could you do 45?

18:21.252 --> 18:23.462
I work a couple of streets away.

18:23.947 --> 18:25.650
OK, I don't do this often.

18:25.760 --> 18:27.932
Actually, never before. Not like this.

18:28.289 --> 18:31.354
How do you ask someone
out? I've no idea.

18:31.525 --> 18:33.722
I suspect you just ask them.

18:34.143 --> 18:35.630
OK.

18:36.504 --> 18:38.330
Do you want to get some lunch?

18:38.690 --> 18:39.930
You can say no.

18:39.977 --> 18:41.455
That's kind, but...

18:41.665 --> 18:44.838
Oh, patient, doctor, frowned upon?

18:45.065 --> 18:47.900
I'm just not looking
for that kind of thing.

18:48.189 --> 18:50.340
No problem. Are you with someone or...?

18:50.572 --> 18:54.635
I'm just not looking for a
relationship at the moment.

18:54.861 --> 18:56.116
Sure.

18:56.166 --> 19:00.262
So, full disclosure. He
sent me an invitation.

19:00.393 --> 19:01.640
Simon.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.812
- You?
- To his wedding party.

19:04.086 --> 19:06.930
It's OK, I'm not going.
I've texted him already.

19:07.078 --> 19:10.539
I'm surprised that he invited me,
but I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

19:10.601 --> 19:12.642
- I didn't want to upset you.
- What is he doing?

19:12.734 --> 19:14.851
- What do you mean?
- Well, who else has he invited?

19:14.937 --> 19:17.600
He's organising a party and
he's lived here most of his life,

19:17.648 --> 19:19.083
so I imagine quite a lot of people.

19:19.163 --> 19:21.006
How can he afford to live in The Acres?

19:21.249 --> 19:23.788
He nearly bankrupted us and
what was left went to me.

19:23.836 --> 19:26.491
What, two years later he's
in a million-pound house?

19:26.569 --> 19:29.772
- What's going on?
- It's not your problem.

19:30.030 --> 19:31.186
No.

19:34.357 --> 19:35.600
OK.

20:14.806 --> 20:16.494
I got this!

20:20.760 --> 20:22.713
You can go if you want.

21:00.427 --> 21:04.146
You look amazing. Good choice, I think.

21:05.458 --> 21:07.962
- You should wear a suit more often.
- No, thanks.

21:09.745 --> 21:11.592
That's Neil.

21:13.037 --> 21:15.505
<i>Hey, are guys ready to go?</i>

21:15.673 --> 21:17.520
<i>Absolutely.</i>

21:17.917 --> 21:20.406
<i>And he looks very smart.</i>

21:31.899 --> 21:33.540
What's this?

21:34.180 --> 21:36.805
- Was it you? A Windsor knot?
- It's a wedding.

21:36.891 --> 21:40.289
But he's 15. He looks like he's
going to the Tory Party conference.

21:40.337 --> 21:41.468
Come here, Tom.

21:41.516 --> 21:42.570
Everything all right?

21:42.618 --> 21:45.900
Yeah, let me just... Oh,
yes, everything's marvellous.

21:45.947 --> 21:49.162
- Yeah, how's that tie going?
- Thanks for dropping him off.

21:49.313 --> 21:51.165
It's a great suit.
You've chosen well.

21:51.213 --> 21:53.484
- We liked it, didn't we?
- Yeah.

21:53.735 --> 21:56.430
You don't have to be there long.
It's the right thing.

21:56.506 --> 21:57.790
I know.

21:57.930 --> 21:59.352
See? Better.

21:59.540 --> 22:01.047
Made a man of him.

22:01.212 --> 22:03.938
When you want to come back,
give me a call, I'll pick you up.

22:04.241 --> 22:08.058
I'm so happy for you.
Brilliant idea. Just take your mind off it.

22:09.837 --> 22:11.590
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

22:11.696 --> 22:14.902
Don't drink. There'll be lots
of booze there, I'm sure, but...

22:14.949 --> 22:17.786
- I'm 15.
- That's what I'm worried about.

22:21.069 --> 22:22.774
Could you, erm...

22:23.040 --> 22:24.532
give this to Kate?

22:25.528 --> 22:28.501
- Is it a bomb?
- Don't be ridiculous.

22:34.672 --> 22:36.421
Honestly, you look incredible.

22:36.547 --> 22:39.204
Objectively speaking, not flirting.

22:40.047 --> 22:41.902
- Promise.
- Understood.

22:42.102 --> 22:43.972
Have a great time.

22:44.508 --> 22:46.196
Enjoy it!

23:01.152 --> 23:03.011
- Hi.
- Hello.

23:09.081 --> 23:10.640
So glad you called.

23:11.456 --> 23:12.612
How did you get my number?

23:12.749 --> 23:14.777
- From the system, I suppose.
- Yeah.

23:14.954 --> 23:17.889
You're not supposed to, but I
thought you might be worth it.

23:17.999 --> 23:22.292
Well, thanks. So I've already
ordered wine, as you can see.

23:22.683 --> 23:24.948
Took a guess at what you'd
like. Hope it's all right.

23:25.144 --> 23:26.556
It's perfect.

23:31.894 --> 23:33.854
So tell me about you.

23:34.897 --> 23:37.308
- What do you want to know?
- I want to know everything.

23:37.909 --> 23:42.020
Well, single. Had a previous
long-term relationship with a woman

23:42.097 --> 23:44.532
that I met at university but that ended.

23:44.792 --> 23:46.691
Moving on. Didn't ask my sexual history!

23:46.761 --> 23:50.823
Erm, my favourite colour is
green, I like Mexican food,

23:50.871 --> 23:53.930
I've travelled quite a
bit, though not for a while.

23:55.628 --> 23:56.880
Children?

23:56.927 --> 24:00.752
Good question. No. None.
Yet. That I know of.

24:00.995 --> 24:02.051
Bad joke.

24:02.177 --> 24:06.354
What else? I have no major medical
issues except for this strain,

24:06.549 --> 24:08.268
which, by the way,
is feeling much better.

24:08.316 --> 24:09.678
Good.

24:10.683 --> 24:13.628
- What do you do?
- I'm a frustrated centre forward.

24:13.792 --> 24:14.920
What?

24:15.159 --> 24:17.656
And not a bad poker player
as well, so watch out.

24:19.769 --> 24:21.888
But in real life I'm a teacher.

24:23.416 --> 24:24.894
I'm sorry.

24:25.135 --> 24:27.349
My son's at a party and I just...

24:27.397 --> 24:28.832
I need to check on him.

24:28.980 --> 24:30.662
- How old is he?
- 15.

24:30.745 --> 24:33.823
- You trust him?
- Absolutely.

24:34.605 --> 24:36.736
I'm sure he'll be all right.

24:37.617 --> 24:40.766
He didn't want to go,
actually. He was worried.

24:44.698 --> 24:47.056
- Do you do much of this?
- Dating?

24:47.925 --> 24:49.348
No.

24:49.518 --> 24:52.150
- PHONE BUZZES
- Sorry.

24:53.767 --> 24:55.222
I'm aware
I might be coming across

24:55.270 --> 24:58.227
as a bit boring.
I promise you I'm not.

24:58.566 --> 25:00.706
I'm actually pretty
much up for anything.

25:01.191 --> 25:03.926
How about you? Used to dates?

25:05.073 --> 25:07.823
No. I don't need a partner. I never did.

25:08.167 --> 25:09.260
Fine on my own.

25:09.472 --> 25:12.416
- OK, that's good to know.
- No, I didn't mean...

25:15.425 --> 25:18.269
- This isn't working.
- We only just started.

25:18.644 --> 25:21.281
No, I'm distracted and
I shouldn't be here.

25:21.430 --> 25:23.212
I'm sorry to waste your time.

25:23.477 --> 25:25.774
- You're going home?
- Home? No.

25:26.139 --> 25:27.706
Where, then?

25:28.222 --> 25:30.024
Why?
Do you want to come with me?

25:35.156 --> 25:38.406
Yeah, yeah,
leave it to Grandad.

25:38.586 --> 25:43.258
Honestly, a lifetime of experience
and you put me on door duty.

25:43.406 --> 25:44.953
Thanks!

25:45.016 --> 25:46.422
Right.

25:46.703 --> 25:48.164
Hey!

25:48.306 --> 25:51.729
Hi. Sorry we're late.
Tom's already here.

25:51.777 --> 25:54.260
- Yeah, he is. Are you...?
- This is James.

25:54.438 --> 25:56.055
- He's really good at poker.
- Hi.

25:56.103 --> 25:57.203
Good to meet you.

25:57.251 --> 26:00.125
- He's my plus one.
- Does Simon know you're coming?

26:00.552 --> 26:02.309
Yeah.

26:03.443 --> 26:05.802
Are you going to invite us in?

26:07.100 --> 26:08.799
Thanks.

26:10.102 --> 26:13.578
It's a big house. I hope you're
not bankrolling him again.

26:13.654 --> 26:15.399
I haven't given him anything.

26:15.595 --> 26:17.883
Please, Gemma,
don't make a scene.

26:18.016 --> 26:19.399
Gemma!

26:19.578 --> 26:21.930
- Let's get a drink.
- Sure.

26:24.070 --> 26:25.641
When you said
your son was at a party,

26:25.689 --> 26:28.082
I was thinking cheap cider
and hip-hop.

26:28.742 --> 26:30.229
You know these people?

26:30.327 --> 26:33.828
- There's something I need to explain.
- Yeah, I'm getting that impression.

26:35.336 --> 26:38.140
- Hi.
- I-I didn't think you were...

26:38.188 --> 26:40.563
This is James. James, Ros, Connor.

26:40.617 --> 26:43.195
- Hello.
- Her fiancé. He's a builder.

26:43.313 --> 26:45.374
- I like Connor a lot.
- Gemma...

26:45.422 --> 26:46.686
So glad you're having a good time.

26:46.734 --> 26:47.874
Does Simon know you're here?

26:47.922 --> 26:50.286
Um. Well,
he invited Tom so that's close.

26:50.334 --> 26:51.845
Close, you mean he doesn't?

26:52.711 --> 26:55.789
We'll see you in a bit. I
promised James some dessert.

26:58.086 --> 26:59.985
So Simon is...?

27:00.203 --> 27:02.686
- Simon's my ex-husband.
- OK.

27:02.733 --> 27:04.602
And this is his wedding party.

27:05.351 --> 27:07.330
See? Fun!

27:10.524 --> 27:12.463
And here he comes.

27:14.274 --> 27:17.181
Simon, this is James.
James, Simon.

27:17.228 --> 27:19.039
- Hi.
- Excuse me.

27:20.610 --> 27:23.172
- What do you want?
- Some dessert would be excellent.

27:23.320 --> 27:26.983
I mean from me. I sent you
the picture to reassure you.

27:27.031 --> 27:28.977
A picture showing our
15-year-old getting drunk?

27:29.039 --> 27:31.022
One glass.
This isn't to do with him.

27:31.070 --> 27:33.311
You wouldn't turn up unless you
were after something yourself.

27:33.359 --> 27:35.109
Out of the whole world,
you chose to come back

27:35.156 --> 27:37.011
and live less than a
mile from my front door.

27:37.058 --> 27:40.359
- You invite my son, most of my friends.
- My friends originally.

27:40.406 --> 27:43.031
- You want me to go home?
- Of course I want you to go home.

27:43.079 --> 27:45.612
- And if I refuse?
- You'll be an embarrassment.

27:45.767 --> 27:48.224
- To you and your wife?
- To Tom.

27:50.791 --> 27:52.820
And yourself.

27:57.488 --> 27:59.087
Go.

27:59.906 --> 28:04.185
You've got a bit of fluff.
Something on your shoulder.

28:05.626 --> 28:07.655
There. That's better.

28:09.466 --> 28:11.595
And, yes, I refuse.

28:26.695 --> 28:29.406
- That's your ex-husband?
- Could you tell?

28:29.578 --> 28:31.258
He seemed upset.

28:31.758 --> 28:34.185
That's sort of the point.

28:37.031 --> 28:38.234
What are you doing?

28:38.326 --> 28:40.711
Dad sent me a picture. I
wanted to see if you were OK.

28:40.789 --> 28:42.711
People are looking.
You can't just turn up.

28:42.759 --> 28:45.734
- Hi, Tom.
- Mr Mohan?

28:45.875 --> 28:49.305
That's who you went on
date with? My teacher?!

28:49.500 --> 28:51.513
- I didn't know.
- Jesus.

28:51.615 --> 28:54.220
- How many of those have you had?
- How many have you had?

28:54.656 --> 28:56.571
- Hi, Doctor F, you all right?
- Hey.

28:56.664 --> 28:58.750
Sir, I didn't know that you...

28:59.000 --> 29:00.375
No way!

29:00.805 --> 29:03.035
Mum, honestly,
I'll just call Anna later as planned

29:03.128 --> 29:05.070
so, erm, you can leave, yeah?

29:05.178 --> 29:07.031
Shall we go outside?

29:08.742 --> 29:12.328
Maybe he's right.
You should just let him get on with it.

29:12.444 --> 29:14.721
Yeah, I probably should.

29:17.738 --> 29:19.487
But I won't.

29:21.196 --> 29:22.789
Why not?

29:23.375 --> 29:25.516
Because I'm supposed
to sit dutifully at home

29:25.594 --> 29:28.019
and pretend it's fine that
my friends are celebrating

29:28.067 --> 29:30.148
the man who ruined my life.

29:31.456 --> 29:33.469
That's what I'm supposed to do.

29:34.766 --> 29:37.508
But I don't think there's any harm
in reminding them what happened.

29:38.516 --> 29:42.508
To make sure that even if they
all forgive, they don't forget.

29:44.539 --> 29:47.391
If you think I'm mad,
you don't have to stay.

29:49.903 --> 29:51.512
Thanks.

30:00.724 --> 30:02.005
Hello!

30:02.053 --> 30:04.882
Erm, so, while I can, erm...

30:05.397 --> 30:08.093
Accustomed as I am to public speaking,

30:08.194 --> 30:11.538
I'm simply going to say
thank you so much for coming

30:11.733 --> 30:16.171
and, on this occasion,
stand aside and introduce...

30:16.460 --> 30:17.765
my wife!

30:21.482 --> 30:22.796
Erm...

30:28.516 --> 30:31.930
Do you know what? I'm...
I'm just going to make it up.

30:32.485 --> 30:33.883
Erm...

30:34.305 --> 30:37.586
never let it be said that
we do things the easy way.

30:38.446 --> 30:40.876
You all know how we got together

30:41.018 --> 30:44.391
and you all know why we moved away.

30:44.696 --> 30:47.657
It's been difficult
for us for a long time.

30:47.821 --> 30:51.281
But it's so good to be back
home, with so many familiar faces

30:51.430 --> 30:55.889
and it's wonderful that you
can all come here and forgive us

30:55.969 --> 30:58.171
and put the past in the past.

30:58.414 --> 31:01.344
We promise not to let you down again.

31:01.591 --> 31:04.016
All we want now is the quiet life.

31:04.603 --> 31:06.270
Yes?

31:07.415 --> 31:11.555
Actually, I also would
like to thank Gemma...

31:13.236 --> 31:15.215
for coming here tonight.

31:16.360 --> 31:18.661
It has to be said you
weren't entirely invited.

31:18.727 --> 31:21.421
Well, not invited at
all, but you're here...

31:21.626 --> 31:23.045
with...

31:24.352 --> 31:25.971
I'm sorry, we haven't met.

31:26.055 --> 31:27.669
- James.
- James.

31:27.883 --> 31:30.654
You're here with James
and I hope that means

31:30.701 --> 31:32.409
you want the best for us.

31:32.773 --> 31:35.024
That you're willing to forgive
everything that's happened

31:35.110 --> 31:38.172
and move on
for Amelie and for Tom.

31:42.102 --> 31:44.741
I assume that's why you've come here.

31:51.045 --> 31:53.124
Do you wish us well?

32:00.866 --> 32:03.191
Of course. I hope you'll be very happy.

32:03.373 --> 32:06.159
Phew! That was like
The X Factor results.

32:06.377 --> 32:09.901
Erm, good. Well, we wish you
and James the very best too.

32:09.962 --> 32:15.496
Erm, and hopefully it will be
peace and quiet from now on.

32:16.487 --> 32:19.057
Now, I have a long
list of people to thank.

32:19.119 --> 32:21.727
If you're not one of them,
it's not that you're less important,

32:21.774 --> 32:26.604
it's that you'll get less annoyed
if you're off, so brace yourselves.

32:26.703 --> 32:28.354
Here we go.
Mum and Dad.

32:28.426 --> 32:30.377
Oh, you don't have to
thank us, sweetheart.

32:30.432 --> 32:32.346
Yes, she bloody well does!

32:35.018 --> 32:36.331
Excuse me.

32:36.533 --> 32:40.494
On behalf of me, Simon and
Amelie for always being there for us.

32:40.596 --> 32:43.440
I personally don't know
what we would do without you.

32:43.932 --> 32:45.604
Love you, guys.

32:46.034 --> 32:47.665
Come here.

32:49.996 --> 32:53.401
<i>Look at you.
You want to make a speech.</i>

32:53.448 --> 32:55.949
<i>Go on, off you go.</i>

32:55.996 --> 32:58.379
<i>All right, all right!</i>

32:58.426 --> 33:02.121
<i>Well, now, before we
reflect on the happy couple,</i>

33:02.168 --> 33:07.339
<i>I want to start with some early
memories of my wonderful daughte</i> r

33:07.386 --> 33:11.425
<i>to give you some idea of
what she was really like...</i>

35:24.374 --> 35:26.963
- What are you doing?
- Your face is red.

35:27.887 --> 35:30.606
- How's your blood pressure these days?
- Why are you here?

35:30.700 --> 35:33.027
- In this room or in your house?
- Both.

35:34.166 --> 35:37.207
Because in all honesty, Simon,
I need to feel like there's been

35:37.255 --> 35:40.958
some ill-effect from the things
that you've done to me and Tom.

35:41.387 --> 35:44.429
Looking at everyone down
there, this huge house,

35:44.661 --> 35:46.325
your clothes, the car outside

35:46.373 --> 35:49.457
and... the little expensive
vibrator in the drawer.

35:49.621 --> 35:51.924
I don't think you've suffered at all.

35:53.301 --> 35:55.040
- Are you going to have another one?
- What?

35:55.273 --> 35:56.339
Child.

35:56.387 --> 35:57.388
You're drunk.

35:57.436 --> 35:58.834
There's one thing
that you don't have.

35:58.882 --> 36:00.193
- Gemma.
- Me.

36:01.586 --> 36:04.106
- I had a real shock tonight.
- You need to come downstairs...

36:04.154 --> 36:06.737
I dressed like this for
James' benefit, actually.

36:07.097 --> 36:10.965
I loosened it up a bit before
I got here, but I didn't expect

36:11.085 --> 36:14.200
when I was standing close
to you, just after I arrived,

36:14.248 --> 36:17.184
and I picked that bit of
fluff off your shoulder,

36:17.497 --> 36:20.714
I didn't expect to feel your cock...

36:21.916 --> 36:23.665
getting bigger.

36:24.293 --> 36:26.944
Poking into my thigh,
despite everything.

36:28.098 --> 36:30.721
I have a feeling that doesn't
happen so much with Kate any more.

36:30.769 --> 36:34.520
- Were you always like this?
- I think you know I absolutely was.

36:38.981 --> 36:40.820
Admit how you feel about me.

36:42.871 --> 36:44.887
And then I'll know you're suffering.

36:47.903 --> 36:50.145
Admit you still find me
attractive, then I'll go.

36:50.332 --> 36:52.132
I told you, of course
I still think about you.

36:52.201 --> 36:55.468
Admit that you're starting to
get a hard-on just looking at me.

36:56.935 --> 36:59.170
- Honestly?
- Honestly.

36:59.522 --> 37:01.429
Then I'll go.

37:05.075 --> 37:07.528
- Yes, I find you very attractive.
- I'm your type.

37:07.668 --> 37:10.067
We were married for a long time,
very successfully,

37:10.121 --> 37:12.720
- and that would seem to suggest...
- It wasn't about me.

37:13.090 --> 37:15.989
- The reason you looked elsewhere.
- I never said it was.

37:16.300 --> 37:17.848
So your feelings for me are...

37:17.934 --> 37:20.536
- Still there to some extent, of course.
- Does Kate know this?

37:20.684 --> 37:21.949
She's not stupid.

37:21.997 --> 37:24.192
No, I know she's not stupid.

37:25.442 --> 37:29.090
What is it with you and
intellectually superior women?

37:29.705 --> 37:32.360
- Actually, we're both quite...
- She's nothing like you.

37:32.407 --> 37:34.784
Does she know you still
have feelings for me?

37:35.935 --> 37:37.684
She'd be shocked to hear it.

37:38.067 --> 37:41.911
I'm recording this conversation
by the way. Now, on my phone.

37:43.345 --> 37:46.174
It's had it going all night
just in case I needed it.

37:47.375 --> 37:50.739
Jesus. Fine. I won't be
blackmailed. Do what you want.

37:50.856 --> 37:52.594
I didn't really record it.

37:55.943 --> 37:58.392
- OK.
- Actually, I did.

38:01.243 --> 38:04.328
This is exactly the kind
of game that you enjoy.

38:04.707 --> 38:08.340
And now Kate's no longer a
secret. She's become boring.

38:10.051 --> 38:12.043
You like the intrigue.

38:13.004 --> 38:15.144
I'm all about games.

38:20.060 --> 38:21.619
Stop.

38:25.305 --> 38:28.208
We've moved, we're here.

38:28.262 --> 38:31.778
It doesn't matter what you do
or what you say, it's too late.

38:31.826 --> 38:34.879
Which is why you didn't
tell me till it was all done.

38:35.184 --> 38:37.722
So that you were just a
fact I had to deal with.

38:37.770 --> 38:39.590
You can always find
somewhere else yourself.

38:46.715 --> 38:48.965
Yes, that's what you want, isn't it?

38:51.786 --> 38:53.915
You want to get rid of me.

38:58.352 --> 39:00.381
Then what's the plan?

39:01.640 --> 39:03.339
Wait and see.

39:11.491 --> 39:13.470
Again.

39:14.381 --> 39:17.110
You just can't help yourself, can you?

39:23.025 --> 39:25.284
Do you want to?

39:27.179 --> 39:28.928
Do you?

39:32.809 --> 39:35.724
I'd rather slit my own throat.

39:48.275 --> 39:51.239
What's going on? Where's Simon?

39:51.768 --> 39:53.751
We were in your bedroom.

39:54.246 --> 39:56.914
- What do you want from us really?
- My son.

39:57.829 --> 39:59.982
And then a taxi.

40:00.582 --> 40:02.584
Here, something for later.

40:04.770 --> 40:06.569

<i>Hi, it's Tom.
Leave a message.</i>

41:24.973 --> 41:26.672
Tom?

41:31.730 --> 41:33.529
Tom?

41:44.445 --> 41:46.194
Tom!

42:05.495 --> 42:06.898
Tom?

42:07.218 --> 42:09.337
Tom, where have you been?

42:10.166 --> 42:12.901
I don't want any arguments.
We're going home now.

42:13.701 --> 42:15.368
Good.

42:25.410 --> 42:27.669
You need a lift?

42:30.485 --> 42:32.084
Thanks.

42:44.049 --> 42:45.533
- Sorry.
- No problem.

42:45.588 --> 42:47.026
Sorry about tonight.

42:47.174 --> 42:50.950
I was worried about Tom,
but it's embarrassing for you, I know.

42:51.080 --> 42:52.690
Can I call you?

42:53.135 --> 42:54.842
Seriously?

42:58.655 --> 43:00.338
Yeah.

43:00.705 --> 43:02.594
Yeah, you can.

43:25.131 --> 43:28.631
Your dad has no idea.
No sense of responsibility.

43:29.965 --> 43:32.045
- You're not going there again.
- Mum!

43:32.183 --> 43:34.405
What? You don't want to anyway, do you?

43:34.537 --> 43:37.646
- Everyone at school's going to know.
- What about?

43:42.428 --> 43:43.764
Oh.

43:44.756 --> 43:48.350
Well, OK.
I had no idea he was your teacher

43:48.716 --> 43:51.846
- and if I'd have realised, I would have...
- So desperate.

43:55.615 --> 43:57.174
OK.

43:59.499 --> 44:00.862
Sorry.

44:00.990 --> 44:02.934
You're not desperate.

44:08.455 --> 44:10.154
It's fine.

44:13.319 --> 44:15.578
Are you OK, mister?

44:20.014 --> 44:21.803
Hey.

44:25.376 --> 44:26.779
Night, Mum.

44:27.337 --> 44:28.583
Night.

45:47.450 --> 45:49.249
It's good.

45:49.584 --> 45:53.287
- How have you found the last few months?
- Oh, very good.

45:53.334 --> 45:54.608
The work isn't too much?

45:54.655 --> 45:56.763
- You don't find it stressful?
- No.

45:58.230 --> 46:00.935
You must be the only GP
in the country to say that.

46:01.006 --> 46:02.732
Well, it's all about planning.

46:02.889 --> 46:06.434
Efficiency of time, efficiency of
language in the consultation room

46:06.536 --> 46:09.075
and making sure you
provide excellent care,

46:09.130 --> 46:11.185
both personally and medically.

46:11.408 --> 46:12.661
Right.

46:12.884 --> 46:14.458
If you're finding it difficult,

46:14.506 --> 46:16.659
I could always show you
how I organise my time.

46:16.707 --> 46:18.846
How do you feel you've been
getting on with everyone? OK?

46:18.893 --> 46:20.061
Yes.

46:20.167 --> 46:25.174
I only ask because sometimes we can
be abrasive without realising it.

46:25.252 --> 46:27.533
I think I would know if
someone was finding me abrasive.

46:27.581 --> 46:28.822
- You would?
- I would.

46:28.870 --> 46:30.472
You'd know if you were
having a conversation

46:30.519 --> 46:33.674
with someone and they were
finding you irritating?

46:33.738 --> 46:36.189
Yes,
I think that would be very clear.

46:36.658 --> 46:39.830
For me, Gemma, whatever
someone's personal feelings,

46:39.939 --> 46:42.306
I think it's always important
to act professionally,

46:42.400 --> 46:44.205
no matter what challenges I face.

46:44.266 --> 46:45.597
All right.

46:45.653 --> 46:48.650
And no matter what's going
on in my personal life.

46:57.657 --> 46:59.406
All right.

47:00.103 --> 47:01.329
It's good to see you.

47:01.377 --> 47:02.798
Oh, Doctor...

47:03.760 --> 47:05.269
Sorry, Gordon, one minute.

47:05.416 --> 47:07.067
These came for you.

47:07.533 --> 47:09.385
- What? When?
- This morning.

47:09.549 --> 47:12.037
Can you take them? We
don't have the facilities.

47:12.189 --> 47:15.369
- You just need to put them in a vase.
- We don't have a vase.

47:30.150 --> 47:32.178
<i>Hi,
it's James. Leave a message.</i>

47:33.971 --> 47:37.752
Hi, James. It's Gemma.
I just got your...

47:41.673 --> 47:43.662
Your... Sorry.

47:49.173 --> 47:52.705
- Gordon, how are you?
- Well, I don't know where to start.

47:52.846 --> 47:54.807
My hair doesn't feel
right in the mornings

47:54.855 --> 47:56.850
and the headaches are still...

47:57.755 --> 47:59.562
Doctor, are you all right?

48:00.447 --> 48:03.103
I'm just a little under the weather.
It's nothing to worry about.

48:03.274 --> 48:05.791
Do you want to come and
sit down? When did it start?

48:05.932 --> 48:08.064
Sorry, Gordon, could you
just give me a minute?

48:08.136 --> 48:09.893
Doctor?

48:36.794 --> 48:39.573
<i>Hi, it's
Tom. Leave a message.</i>

48:41.756 --> 48:43.595
Hey, it's me.

48:44.504 --> 48:48.379
I just wanted to make sure that
you were all right after last night.

48:49.354 --> 48:54.629
I... I've found today quite
difficult, actually.

48:54.761 --> 48:56.198
Erm...

48:56.682 --> 48:58.241
your dad...

48:59.344 --> 49:02.073
I don't think he's being very fair.

49:03.844 --> 49:06.536
Anyway,
you call me back when you can.

49:09.333 --> 49:11.222
Love you.

50:05.394 --> 50:06.979
- What do you want?
- Is Simon here?

50:07.097 --> 50:08.699
- He's working.
- From home?

50:08.746 --> 50:10.354
Do you see his car?

50:10.651 --> 50:12.813
He sent me flowers with this.

50:16.795 --> 50:18.478
I don't think so.

50:18.706 --> 50:21.047
- Do you know what he's doing to me?
- Doing to you?

50:21.094 --> 50:23.767
- Playing with me. Texting me.
- He texted you our address,

50:23.814 --> 50:25.399
if that's what you mean,
out of courtesy

50:25.446 --> 50:26.677
so you know what's going on.

50:26.724 --> 50:27.730
Do you know what he said to me
at the party?

50:27.777 --> 50:28.784
What did he say?

50:28.832 --> 50:30.213
That he...

50:31.011 --> 50:32.833
That he still finds me attractive.

50:34.534 --> 50:35.849
That's sweet...

50:36.176 --> 50:37.793
but unlikely.

50:39.026 --> 50:41.011
He didn't invite you to our party.

50:41.268 --> 50:44.328
He didn't tell you to do any of
the crazy things that you've done.

50:44.659 --> 50:48.619
Gemma, it's not that we hate you,
it's not that anybody hates you,

50:48.667 --> 50:51.393
it's just none of us really
think about you at all.

50:52.401 --> 50:54.097
But I'll make it easy.

50:54.808 --> 50:56.537
If you come here again,
I'm calling the police.

50:56.584 --> 50:57.889
- Did you look at my present?
- No.

50:57.936 --> 50:59.112
You should.

51:09.292 --> 51:10.991
Tom!

51:13.362 --> 51:16.456
Tom, sorry I'm late.
I hope you made your way to the kitchen.

51:16.573 --> 51:18.197
I'll find...

51:18.581 --> 51:20.159
- He's not back yet.
- Get out.

51:20.206 --> 51:21.472
We should talk.

51:21.534 --> 51:22.819
- How did you...?
- I've got a key.

51:22.866 --> 51:24.581
- I changed the locks.
- I changed my key.

51:24.664 --> 51:25.715
This is my house.

51:25.894 --> 51:28.026
I copied it from Tom's a few weeks ago.

51:28.074 --> 51:30.681
You pushed your way
into my house. Calm down.

51:37.144 --> 51:40.190
- Why did you send me these?
- I don't know what you mean.

51:40.394 --> 51:42.229
Why would I send you flowers?
What made you think it was me?

51:42.276 --> 51:44.519
Because the message called me a bitch.

51:45.026 --> 51:46.370
Oh, those flowers.

51:46.440 --> 51:49.589
Yeah, that was me.
Last night. Got drunk. Went online.

51:49.847 --> 51:51.651
Just stop! This isn't a game.

51:51.808 --> 51:55.424
You ruined my life, you hit me,
you hurt our son forever.

51:55.472 --> 51:56.573
Not just me, both of us.

51:56.621 --> 51:58.267
But it's so much easier for you,
isn't it?

51:58.315 --> 52:00.627
You were never cheated on.
No-one's ever betrayed your trust.

52:00.674 --> 52:03.472
You had a pretty good go.
You told me that you'd killed our son.

52:03.520 --> 52:05.323
I made you feel the horror of it.

52:05.455 --> 52:08.354
I think you've forgotten that
you lied to me for two years.

52:08.562 --> 52:10.585
All the time you were
sleeping with another woman,

52:10.664 --> 52:12.743
cheated me out of money,
lied to our son,

52:12.791 --> 52:14.690
betrayed every promise
that you ever made.

52:15.258 --> 52:17.995
A few months after we split,
once everything was settled,

52:18.045 --> 52:20.998
clearly, as you say, you moved on,
because you could.

52:21.479 --> 52:22.979
But I can't.

52:23.309 --> 52:25.471
As far as I'm concerned,
it could happen again.

52:25.597 --> 52:28.557
Anyone could be lying to
me and I wouldn't know.

52:30.479 --> 52:31.752
Well, sorry.

52:32.423 --> 52:34.632
Maybe
you should see someone about that.

52:35.746 --> 52:37.751
Please stop. Just go away.

52:37.799 --> 52:40.052
You want sympathy? Help?
More money? Grow up.

52:40.100 --> 52:42.354
You must have guessed how
I'd react when you came back.

52:42.416 --> 52:44.018
Like I said,
I know you really well.

52:44.276 --> 52:46.002
You want me to move?

52:46.229 --> 52:48.415
You hope that I'm going to
sell this place and take Tom

52:48.463 --> 52:50.980
- and go somewhere far away.
- No... not with Tom.

52:55.049 --> 52:57.532
Walking back in here,
it's like you've been frozen.

52:57.579 --> 52:59.064
You need to get over what happened,

52:59.111 --> 53:02.393
and the only way you can is by
moving away. Everyone knows it.

53:02.441 --> 53:04.142
What do you mean, "everyone"?

53:04.241 --> 53:07.182
Approaching 40 and in denial?
So much happier.

53:07.277 --> 53:10.276
You could be so much
more if you just move on.

53:11.178 --> 53:12.763
It's been two years.

53:12.923 --> 53:14.249
Two years is nothing.

53:14.862 --> 53:17.143
OK, well, I was born here,
I grew up here,

53:17.344 --> 53:19.846
my friends are here,
my work is here.

53:19.915 --> 53:23.114
There's only one way I'm leaving
now and that's in a coffin.

53:24.963 --> 53:26.596
That's good to know.

53:31.787 --> 53:34.307
- Hey.
- Oh!

53:34.432 --> 53:37.721
Your dad came round
to talk through a few things.

53:39.408 --> 53:41.073
I just need to get my bag.

53:41.253 --> 53:42.590
Bag for what?

53:43.379 --> 53:44.916
Tom?

53:45.450 --> 53:47.149
What does he mean, his bag?

53:49.844 --> 53:51.823
In the end, you will leave.

53:52.088 --> 53:54.284
You can find a new job,
new house.

53:54.784 --> 53:57.144
In a few years you'll look back and
realise I was doing you a favour.

53:57.191 --> 53:58.557
A bag for what?

53:58.849 --> 54:00.791
Hey, love, what's that?

54:00.926 --> 54:03.213
- Tom, answer me.
- Can you stop talking to me?

54:03.261 --> 54:05.356
- If there's a problem...
- Yes, there's a problem.

54:05.404 --> 54:06.993
- Are we going?
- Going where?

54:07.041 --> 54:08.352
- Dad's.
- To stay?

54:08.399 --> 54:10.152
- Yeah.
- Is this about last night?

54:10.199 --> 54:11.237
- Look, I know...
- Shut up.

54:11.284 --> 54:12.714
I know you found that embarrassing...

54:12.761 --> 54:14.214
- It's not about that.
- Tom.

54:14.261 --> 54:16.205
He's not going anywhere.

54:16.467 --> 54:17.558
Tom!

54:17.739 --> 54:19.088
Tom, please!

54:19.665 --> 54:21.448
What's this about?

54:21.496 --> 54:23.145
You know what he's like.

54:24.119 --> 54:26.238
Come on, mate, get in.

54:27.309 --> 54:28.908
You stay here!

54:29.839 --> 54:31.374
Mum!

54:31.421 --> 54:33.038
Tom.

54:36.965 --> 54:38.531
Tom!

55:05.114 --> 55:06.732
Was that Simon?

55:07.302 --> 55:09.242
Gemma, talk to me.

55:10.305 --> 55:16.679
