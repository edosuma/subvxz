00:02.377 --> 00:04.922
<i>I don't know why
I came to watch Turk</i>

00:05.005 --> 00:07.216
<i>when I could've been asleep.</i>

00:07.299 --> 00:09.843
<i>I guess I haven't seen
much of him lately.</i>

00:09.927 --> 00:12.429
<i>It's not like I'm desperate.</i>

00:16.975 --> 00:19.978
What makes you think you know better?

00:20.062 --> 00:23.815
- ln my gut l know l'm right.
- We need this decision now.

00:25.317 --> 00:27.945
- Fine, then it's on you.
- Yes, it is.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.696
Nurse.

00:29.780 --> 00:31.990
- Erasure.
- Yes, doctor.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.845
l hate this song.

00:53.637 --> 00:55.722
Me too, man.

01:14.199 --> 01:18.120
<i>A hospital room can be
kind of a romantic place.</i>

01:18.203 --> 01:20.914
<i>Maybe it's the soft green glow
of a heart monitor,</i>

01:20.998 --> 01:23.750
<i>or the way the moonlight
reflects off a bedpan.</i>

01:23.834 --> 01:27.004
Our shifts keep overlapping
on Friday nights.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.673
Closest thing
l've had to a date recently.

01:29.756 --> 01:32.134
Well, l had
a great time tonight.

01:32.217 --> 01:34.386
Oh, yeah. Me too.

01:34.469 --> 01:39.016
- So, can l page you?
- Don't do the two-day waiting thing.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.143
Oh, baby,
l don't play by the rules.

01:41.226 --> 01:43.604
So, goodnight.

01:43.687 --> 01:47.191
<i>Wait. Is she joking?
If she's joking and I kiss her...</i>

01:52.571 --> 01:54.990
<i>Of course,
if she's not joking...</i>

02:09.213 --> 02:11.548
l don't do this
for all the doctors.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.675
<i>Yes!</i>

02:15.511 --> 02:18.263
He's gonna need 40mEqs of KCL.

02:18.347 --> 02:20.599
Grab me when you get the results.

02:20.682 --> 02:22.434
You got it.

02:22.518 --> 02:26.772
His TV is broken, so when you
two start tagging each other,

02:26.855 --> 02:29.942
the least you can do is
wake him up and let him watch.

02:30.692 --> 02:34.196
<i>In my experience, when two friends
miss a chance like this,</i>

02:34.279 --> 02:36.949
<i>you've got exactly 48 hours
to get the kiss.</i>

02:37.032 --> 02:40.827
<i>Or one of you will over-think it.
OK, she's gonna over-think it.</i>

02:40.911 --> 02:44.581
<i>Then you end up permanently
stuck in the Friend Zone.</i>

02:45.499 --> 02:47.084
l'll see ya.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.420
You're such a girl.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.759
Nothing went on between me and Elliot.

02:55.843 --> 02:58.178
Good thing you still
have your flower.

02:58.262 --> 03:00.973
That song is like a virus.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.850
l'm just a little lonely.

03:02.933 --> 03:06.770
l haven't been hanging out with Turk
since he's been dating Carla.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.814
First of all, who's Turk?

03:08.897 --> 03:12.276
And don't answer.
Look, if you have a medical question,

03:12.359 --> 03:15.153
l'm forced by hospital policy
to answer you.

03:15.237 --> 03:18.365
However, if you ask me
about a personal problem,

03:18.448 --> 03:21.159
l'm going to start doing this.

03:24.913 --> 03:27.166
You seem unhappy.

03:27.249 --> 03:29.251
l like that.

03:40.470 --> 03:43.932
l cannot get that stupid song
out of my head.

03:44.016 --> 03:47.686
lt's like a damn virus.
Here's his chart, his transfer note.

03:47.769 --> 03:51.523
He's haemodynamically stable.
Consider him turfed to medicine.

03:51.607 --> 03:53.567
T-Man. l'm gonna get my grub on.

03:55.527 --> 03:58.864
Means he's gonna go eat.

03:58.947 --> 04:01.867
- Surgery went OK?
- lt was cool.

04:03.869 --> 04:08.332
Dude, l got to close
for the first time ever. Ever.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.751
The human body is so disgusting.

04:11.752 --> 04:14.004
Not yours. Yours is stunning.

04:14.087 --> 04:18.216
We should celebrate. Tear it up
like we used to, just the two of us.

04:18.300 --> 04:22.638
- What comes before Part B?
- Part A!

04:22.721 --> 04:25.390
That's right, we used to tear it up.

04:27.392 --> 04:30.771
We should probably
never do that again.

04:32.648 --> 04:36.860
<i>That song is like a virus.</i>

04:46.745 --> 04:47.955
No!

04:48.038 --> 04:49.456
<i>Don't let it be awkward.</i>

04:49.540 --> 04:50.916
<i>Do something cute.</i>

04:50.999 --> 04:53.085
<i>Cover her eyes
and say, ''Guess who?''</i>

04:55.963 --> 04:58.131
- Guess who?
- l can't breathe.

04:58.215 --> 05:01.760
OK, gang, it's time for rounds.

05:01.844 --> 05:05.556
<i>Let's see who's
The Weakest Link.</i>

05:09.518 --> 05:11.603
The Weakest Link!

05:13.689 --> 05:18.318
Now, then, Dr Simotas.

05:18.402 --> 05:22.865
Severe swelling of the lips in this
patient might be an indication of what?

05:22.948 --> 05:25.868
- Angio-oedema.
- Well done, sport.

05:25.951 --> 05:29.621
And what treatment would you
recommend, Dr Dorian?

05:29.705 --> 05:33.083
A combination of steroids
and antihistamines.

05:33.167 --> 05:35.752
Attaboy, sport.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.964
What would you recommend
the patient stay away from,

05:39.047 --> 05:41.592
Dr Reid?

05:41.675 --> 05:46.346
- My first guess would be shellfish.
- Right you are, sweetheart.

05:46.430 --> 05:47.472
Sweetheart?

05:47.556 --> 05:50.517
<i>I could see what was going on
in Elliot's head.</i>

05:51.351 --> 05:54.313
Right you are, sweetheart.

06:02.571 --> 06:05.407
<i>- What do you want to watch?
- Fletch.</i>

06:05.490 --> 06:07.492
<i>- Fletch it is.
- Seen it.</i>

06:07.576 --> 06:10.704
You haven't seen it with us
saying all the lines.

06:10.787 --> 06:13.540
l'm so lucky l met you.

06:13.624 --> 06:15.792
Maybe next time
her mom could come.

06:15.876 --> 06:18.337
You won't even know she's here.

06:18.420 --> 06:22.049
Except she laughs at stupid stuff
and that makes me laugh.

06:22.132 --> 06:26.470
lt's stupid because it's so stupid.

06:26.553 --> 06:30.182
- Tonight's still about us.
- Whatever, l don't care.

06:30.265 --> 06:32.976
Turk, you wanna go hang out
in your room?

06:37.606 --> 06:40.567
l know Dr Kelso
doesn't mean anything by it,

06:40.651 --> 06:43.028
and OK, maybe l am
kind of a sweetheart.

06:43.111 --> 06:46.281
- l'm sleeping.
- But it just sounds so demeaning.

06:46.365 --> 06:49.201
You're not listening
to a word l'm saying.

06:49.284 --> 06:52.162
lt's not like
he's my grandpa or anything.

06:52.246 --> 06:55.457
Anyway, JD always tells me
how much you've helped him.

06:55.541 --> 06:59.044
He obviously hasn't told you
about my ear-flicking policy.

06:59.127 --> 07:02.506
This whole groovy
guidance counsellor thing

07:02.589 --> 07:06.051
you people seem to have working
is a total fantasy.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.720
l'm not that guy.
You can go and ask anybody.

07:08.804 --> 07:12.432
Now, you've got to leave me
alone or l'll punish you.

07:14.434 --> 07:17.479
Sweetheart is kind of innocuous.

07:17.563 --> 07:21.316
Here's what you're gonna do.
Go down there and confront Kelso.

07:21.400 --> 07:22.943
- Really?
- Absolutely.

07:23.026 --> 07:26.488
Never mind
that he is the Chief of Medicine,

07:26.572 --> 07:29.408
he'll have a whole new level
of respect for you.

07:29.491 --> 07:31.034
- Honestly?
- Yes.

07:31.118 --> 07:35.539
You can't have sexist terms
like that around here. You go get 'im.

07:41.211 --> 07:44.214
This guy looks stable
but l still wanna get an EKG.

07:44.298 --> 07:46.091
Let's do cardiac enzymes...

07:46.175 --> 07:48.093
When you say sweetheart...

07:48.177 --> 07:50.345
...and an aspirin.

07:50.429 --> 07:52.931
<i>A lot of my work
has become second nature.</i>

07:53.015 --> 07:55.601
<i>But it gives me too much time to think.</i>

07:55.684 --> 07:58.520
Look, l'm surgery and you're medicine.

07:58.604 --> 08:02.357
This isn't college any more.
Things have to change.

08:02.441 --> 08:07.446
l know relationships change, l guess
l thought yours and mine never would.

08:07.529 --> 08:11.450
- What's going on with you, man?
- We used to look out for each other.

08:11.533 --> 08:13.702
l don't feel you have my back any more.

08:13.785 --> 08:17.206
- You really feel that way?
- Yeah, l do.

08:17.289 --> 08:19.583
You do? Great.

08:19.666 --> 08:23.212
l'll get them from my locker,
you can write me a cheque.

08:23.295 --> 08:27.466
Can you look at Mr Bidwell?
His temperature's starting to spike.

08:28.467 --> 08:30.093
Sure.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.261
Legally, there's a huge difference.

08:32.346 --> 08:35.849
Stitch a patient, sew a sheet to him,
that's an accident.

08:35.933 --> 08:39.602
He tries getting up, gurney collapses,
breaks his front teeth,

08:39.686 --> 08:40.938
that's a lawsuit.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.857
Say it with me.
Accident. Lawsuit.

08:43.941 --> 08:45.567
Accident. Lawsuit.

08:45.651 --> 08:48.487
So, what is it, sweetheart?

08:48.570 --> 08:51.532
lt's the sweetheart thing.
lt doesn't hit me right.

08:51.615 --> 08:54.701
l'm a doctor,
it seems sort of disrespectful.

08:54.785 --> 08:58.455
l've always called men ''sport''
and ladies ''sweetheart''.

08:58.539 --> 09:00.958
But you call Becky ''sport''.

09:04.378 --> 09:09.216
Well, l am so sorry, sport.

09:09.299 --> 09:12.052
lt's one of those bad habits
l've developed

09:12.135 --> 09:15.639
after working in the medical field
for over 30 years.

09:15.722 --> 09:20.185
30 years? But you look so young!

09:22.563 --> 09:25.941
<i>It's hard to see a patient
get worse instead of better.</i>

09:26.024 --> 09:29.152
<i>That's kind of the opposite
of what we're going for.</i>

09:29.236 --> 09:31.363
He was fine last night.

09:31.446 --> 09:35.409
Now he's diaphoretic, in and out
of consciousness, maybe septic.

09:35.492 --> 09:37.953
We won't know till
his blood work's back.

09:38.036 --> 09:41.039
<i>If he's septic, they might
have to re-open this guy.</i>

09:41.123 --> 09:43.917
<i>Course, there's also
a chance he could die.</i>

09:44.001 --> 09:46.753
l've seen this before.
Gauze, sponges,

09:46.837 --> 09:49.673
some young surgeon
left something in this man.

09:49.756 --> 09:54.386
No, l know the guy that closed.
He'd never be that careless.

09:54.469 --> 09:56.513
Excuse me, sorry.

09:56.597 --> 09:58.515
Has anyone seen my keys?

09:58.599 --> 10:01.685
No? How about my wallet?

10:01.768 --> 10:03.854
Anyone?

10:05.522 --> 10:07.941
l've never seen that before.

10:26.627 --> 10:27.878
Turk!

10:27.961 --> 10:30.589
Dr Cox, have you seen Turk?

10:43.018 --> 10:44.061
Turk.

10:45.604 --> 10:49.233
l was just dreaming about you.

10:49.316 --> 10:52.694
You were... Well, we were...

10:52.778 --> 10:55.906
You got a few minutes?

10:56.740 --> 10:59.076
Don't move.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.453
No. Don't move.

11:03.664 --> 11:07.501
- Have you seen Turk?
- Yeah, l saw him.

11:07.584 --> 11:09.878
He just went out that door.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.177
Turk?

11:31.567 --> 11:33.861
Can't hear you.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.323
- What?
- Let me in!

11:38.407 --> 11:40.409
You love who?

11:41.785 --> 11:44.329
Mr Kavanaugh,
your arrhythmia's much better.

11:44.413 --> 11:47.082
Everything looks just great, actually.

11:47.624 --> 11:50.210
You sound surprised.

11:50.294 --> 11:52.212
lt has nothing to do with you.

11:52.296 --> 11:55.507
l had a run-in with Dr Kelso,
so when he switched me to you,

11:55.591 --> 11:58.218
l thought it would be a difficult case.

11:59.928 --> 12:01.805
Go on, l'm listening.

12:01.889 --> 12:05.601
Excuse me while l check
on another penis... patient.

12:05.684 --> 12:08.812
Well, he's a penis patient.

12:11.607 --> 12:12.941
Turk!

12:13.025 --> 12:14.610
No, l gotta talk to you.

12:14.693 --> 12:15.903
No!

12:15.986 --> 12:19.781
lt's nine up, OK? We just
lost our fourth, it's your ball.

12:19.865 --> 12:21.366
lt's important.

12:21.450 --> 12:25.829
This is not a joke either. This is real.
lt's surgical versus medical.

12:25.913 --> 12:28.457
- Your ball, you're shirts.
- Let's play.

12:28.540 --> 12:31.877
<i>There it was. Everything was
more important than me now.</i>

12:31.960 --> 12:34.630
Don't bring in the same crap
the last kid did.

12:34.713 --> 12:36.298
<i>Suddenly, I was so fed up</i>

12:36.381 --> 12:39.885
<i>I decided to teach Turk
and Todd a lesson on the court.</i>

12:43.388 --> 12:45.724
<i>You know, once I warm up a little.</i>

12:57.569 --> 12:59.446
JD, l'm gonna show you...

12:59.530 --> 13:02.282
what the deal...
Oh, oh...

13:02.366 --> 13:05.869
- Throw the body out of him!
- Oh!

13:11.875 --> 13:14.837
All right, that's game.
What's so important?

13:14.920 --> 13:16.839
l was looking at Bidwell...

13:16.922 --> 13:19.049
One second.

13:20.551 --> 13:24.179
l gotta go.
But you played a good game.

13:24.263 --> 13:26.390
l thought you sucked.

13:26.473 --> 13:29.977
Go get your grub on.

13:33.814 --> 13:35.899
- Hey, baby.
- You gotta be kidding.

13:41.363 --> 13:42.489
Yes?

13:42.573 --> 13:48.245
- Sorry to bother you, sir.
- Well, if it isn't ''sport''.

13:48.328 --> 13:52.708
How are things?
Did you see Mr Kavanaugh today?

13:52.791 --> 13:54.459
Yes.

13:55.878 --> 14:00.382
Yes, l did. Dr Kelso,
l just wanted to say, well,

14:00.465 --> 14:04.261
as far as the sweetheart thing goes,
maybe l overreacted.

14:04.344 --> 14:09.141
Are you sure? l wouldn't want you
to be the least bit uncomfortable.

14:09.224 --> 14:14.479
l have no idea what possessed me
to say anything in the first place.

14:14.563 --> 14:17.900
You've got to leave me alone
or l'll punish you.

14:17.983 --> 14:21.862
- Absolutely no idea.
- Super.

14:21.945 --> 14:24.823
Then run along, sweetheart.

14:44.551 --> 14:47.304
Have you seen
Mr Bidwell's blood work?

14:47.387 --> 14:49.306
No, it hasn't come back yet.

14:49.389 --> 14:53.310
- OK, have you seen Turk?
- Not since this morning.

14:53.393 --> 14:56.021
l'm sure you'll see him
before l do, so...

14:56.104 --> 14:59.233
Bambi, are you giving me attitude?

15:00.567 --> 15:03.153
What if l am?

15:03.237 --> 15:07.991
You have to be a minority sidekick
in a bad movie to pull that off.

15:08.075 --> 15:11.578
- You know what l mean, right?
- Child, you speak the truth!

15:11.662 --> 15:13.831
Explain it to him.

15:13.914 --> 15:17.668
You do the hand, then the finger,
then talk through the nose.

15:17.751 --> 15:22.297
Then give a lot of attitude. lf you're
not from there, you don't understand...

15:22.381 --> 15:24.758
- OK, l'm gonna leave now.
- What?

15:24.842 --> 15:28.136
Oh, no, you didn't! Where you going?
Where you going?

15:48.866 --> 15:50.659
Thank you very much.

15:50.742 --> 15:53.120
- What?
- Hi, how are you?

15:53.203 --> 15:56.081
l have a quick legal question.
l'm just curious.

15:56.165 --> 15:59.835
- What if, hypothetically...
- Oh, God! You killed somebody.

15:59.918 --> 16:01.336
- No!
- Someone else did.

16:01.420 --> 16:05.549
- No, no one killed anyone.
- Maimed, mutilated, disfigured.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.718
l'm not sure there is a problem.

16:07.801 --> 16:10.387
l'm running tests,
doing everything l should.

16:10.470 --> 16:14.224
lf you know something, by not
reporting it you're as culpable.

16:14.308 --> 16:16.393
Anything you wanna tell me?

16:16.476 --> 16:20.147
<i>Why am I protecting Turk
when he can't give me five seconds?</i>

16:20.230 --> 16:23.025
<i>- Anything at all?
- Tell him.</i>

16:23.108 --> 16:24.735
No.

16:27.321 --> 16:29.990
Scared the hell out of me.

16:41.126 --> 16:42.503
Dr Cox...

16:42.586 --> 16:45.964
l'm hoping there's another
Dr Cox sat behind me.

16:46.048 --> 16:50.761
Sending me to Kelso like that, l'm not
sure what you were trying to teach me.

16:50.844 --> 16:54.890
The value, and this is important,
of leaving me alone.

16:54.973 --> 16:58.519
- There's more to it than that.
- No, there's not.

16:58.602 --> 17:02.314
Look, l want you to go ahead
and spread the word.

17:02.397 --> 17:05.192
l've had enough.

17:05.275 --> 17:09.238
The next whiny intern that comes
to me for a cookie and a hug,

17:09.320 --> 17:11.949
l swear to Aisha,
l'm going to hurt them.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.326
And you, you one-woman freak show,

17:14.409 --> 17:17.788
take your blah-blah
to the blah-blah-ologist.

17:17.871 --> 17:21.834
lf you're so stupid as to
confront the Chief of Medicine,

17:21.916 --> 17:24.336
over some
quasi-offensive endearment,

17:24.419 --> 17:27.839
then you've got to replace
the captain of your brain ship

17:27.923 --> 17:29.675
because he's drunk.

17:29.758 --> 17:33.762
You're right. l need to learn to
pick my battles. Thank you, sir.

17:36.181 --> 17:37.558
You're welcome.

17:39.309 --> 17:41.478
And you say your husband
hardly wore them?

17:41.562 --> 17:43.897
Fantastic.

17:43.981 --> 17:46.400
The blood work came back.

17:49.236 --> 17:51.321
Negative?

17:51.405 --> 17:53.949
But the guy looks like death.

17:54.032 --> 17:56.201
Hi!

17:56.285 --> 17:58.370
What happened?

17:59.079 --> 18:03.876
There's no infection. He's diabetic.
So when someone gave him insulin,

18:03.959 --> 18:07.129
when he wasn't eating,
he became hypoglycaemic.

18:07.212 --> 18:10.507
The only person
that could've given him insulin...

18:11.842 --> 18:13.010
Me!

18:14.178 --> 18:16.555
<i>l gave him insulin.
Twice.</i>

18:16.638 --> 18:21.226
He's fine, Bambi. l gave him
an amp of D50 and he's eating now.

18:21.310 --> 18:24.897
You should probably give him
some orange juice in an hour.

18:24.980 --> 18:29.318
- Thank you so much. You saved my ass.
- No, it wasn't me.

18:33.488 --> 18:37.034
- Look, Turk.
- Come on, man. l always got your back.

18:37.117 --> 18:38.994
l know.

18:39.077 --> 18:42.080
<i>Tell him how you feel
without sounding like a girl.</i>

18:42.164 --> 18:45.292
l miss you so much
it hurts sometimes.

18:51.381 --> 18:53.383
OK...

18:53.467 --> 18:57.387
- l'm gonna let that go for now.
- Thank you.

18:57.471 --> 19:01.058
We'll find time to hang, man.
We're both swamped right now

19:01.141 --> 19:03.727
and l'm hanging out
with Carla a lot.

19:03.810 --> 19:07.397
But if there was someone you were into
you'd be doing the same.

19:07.481 --> 19:09.274
<i>Crap!</i>

19:12.528 --> 19:15.030
Did Nurse Roberts
sell you these?

19:54.361 --> 19:58.991
- You don't wanna hear about my day.
- You're right. Kiss me.

19:59.074 --> 20:01.910
- Right now?
- We can wait three, four seconds.

20:01.994 --> 20:07.624
- But l just ate, l feel gross.
- Not gross, pretty. Come here.

20:12.671 --> 20:15.883
JD, can we just talk for a second?

20:15.966 --> 20:17.801
<i>It never fails.</i>

20:29.521 --> 20:31.732
Oh, yeah, another one.

20:31.815 --> 20:33.442
How're you doing?

20:33.525 --> 20:36.028
Went to high school with her.

20:36.111 --> 20:38.197
We worked at Penguins Yoghurt.

20:38.280 --> 20:42.367
- l met her on a bus.
- She'll come around.

20:42.451 --> 20:44.786
Pretzel?

20:44.870 --> 20:46.246
Thank you.

20:46.330 --> 20:51.043
The first few weeks have been so hard,
mentally, physically, emotionally.

20:51.126 --> 20:53.420
lt's like math camp all over again.

20:53.504 --> 20:56.340
Not that l've been to math camp,
it's an expression.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.467
l use it all the time.

20:58.550 --> 21:00.552
- Come on.
- Anyway...

21:00.636 --> 21:05.516
<i>Choosing friendship over sex is
the last thing any guy wants to hear,</i>

21:05.599 --> 21:07.684
<i>but you know what?</i>

21:07.768 --> 21:10.604
<i>This time, it actually
made sense to me.</i>

21:10.687 --> 21:14.191
<i>Besides, I challenge anyone
to survive being an intern</i>

21:14.274 --> 21:17.653
<i>without having a close
group of friends to lean on.</i>

21:19.947 --> 21:22.825
l can't believe
you lost our bottle opener.

21:22.908 --> 21:24.993
Yeah, l know.

21:28.956 --> 21:32.501
l miss it so much
it hurts sometimes.

21:33.669 --> 21:36.880
- You're a bad person.
- Don't judge me.
