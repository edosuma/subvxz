crashing the spy plane,

or getting yourselves stranded
on an enemy island.

00:38.788 --> 00:43.334

because you did do all those things!

You can't go take-backsies on a thanks.

00:51.801 --> 00:55.555
He had to stay behind
to monitor the Sudarikov situation.

00:55.638 --> 00:58.475
He stayed for business,
it's nothing personal,

00:58.558 --> 01:00.477

01:07.609 --> 01:10.361
Um… He's building some sort of weapon.

01:10.945 --> 01:14.199
So, no intel on what the weapon could be,
or what he wanted from you?

That Russian is
a slippery little sturgeon.

01:24.125 --> 01:25.960
Sturgeons are fish, native to Russia.

01:26.044 --> 01:29.255
The last time you were with Sudarikov,
there was someone else involved.

01:29.339 --> 01:31.633
Someone who knows
how to contact the Russian

01:31.716 --> 01:33.885
and can help us track down that sturgeon.

-Shashi.

01:35.804 --> 01:37.305
-Shashi?!
-Sova?!

01:37.388 --> 01:40.141
You think we can track down Sudarikov
through his owl?

01:40.225 --> 01:43.520
We'd have a better chance trusting the owl
than we would trusting Shashi.

01:43.603 --> 01:44.729
You're right about that.

I didn't have a ton of time
to negotiate, Toretto.

02:19.389 --> 02:22.267
Shashi wanted a day out
in exchange for information.

02:22.350 --> 02:23.643
This was the compromise.

02:23.726 --> 02:25.812
We shouldn't negotiate with him at all.

02:25.895 --> 02:28.523
Shashi can't be trusted
to hold up his end of the bargain.

You don't wanna get played.

02:31.442 --> 02:33.486

Or what the weapon is he's building?

02:37.615 --> 02:39.325
Or how we can track him down?

02:39.409 --> 02:42.620
Or why he kidnapped you
in the first place? Huh?!

02:44.038 --> 02:47.667

Then let's not waste any time.
Show me the sights of Los Gatos.

Nuh-uh, no way. Ms. Nowhere,
I'm telling you, you can't trust him.

03:35.173 --> 03:37.216
This is all part of his master plan.

03:37.300 --> 03:40.303

You're the one who brought me here.

03:40.386 --> 03:42.222

Yes, but the cocoa is
just hot water and powder.

maybe you should contact Palindrome.

you did to freeze your relationship.

he'll use it against you later.

-[Ms. Nowhere] No.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.135
-What?
-[Ms. Nowhere] No!

11:18.219 --> 11:19.804
Shashi's cage is empty!

11:19.887 --> 11:21.639
[yells] They took him!

11:21.722 --> 11:22.765
[screams]

11:23.391 --> 11:25.309
That's Level Five rage.

11:25.393 --> 11:27.895
Maybe we can track their vehicles
from the satellites.

11:27.978 --> 11:29.730
Everyone, gear up to head out.

11:30.940 --> 11:31.857
We were right.

11:31.941 --> 11:34.151
Ms. Nowhere took a big risk
bringing Shashi here,

11:34.235 --> 11:35.903
and now Sudarikov helped him escape.

11:35.986 --> 11:37.446
Shashi's master plan has worked.

11:37.530 --> 11:41.409
One could assume
Sudarikov's soldiers broke Shashi out.

11:42.118 --> 11:46.038
But this cage is
reinforced, reinforced, reinforced steel!

11:46.122 --> 11:48.833
Triple-reinforced. Standard Agency Cage.

11:48.916 --> 11:51.794
SACs are impossible to penetrate,
and from the looks of it,

11:51.877 --> 11:53.504
the cage lock wasn't tampered with.

11:53.587 --> 11:56.757
Shashi didn't break out, he was let out.

11:57.883 --> 12:00.052
No one was in here except for you.

12:01.345 --> 12:05.808
You had the key. Doesn't take a top-notch
agent to put two and two together.

12:06.725 --> 12:08.310
Layla would never let Shashi out.

12:08.394 --> 12:09.812
-I let Shashi out.
-[gasping]

12:09.895 --> 12:11.021

12:11.105 --> 12:13.315
I got totally outnumbered
with y'all on the roof.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.901
He was helping me
fight off Sudarikov's guys,

12:15.985 --> 12:17.736
and then they took him.

12:17.820 --> 12:20.406
Shashi must have told Sudarikov
he would be here.

12:21.157 --> 12:23.242
Gary! Scour the dark web,

12:23.325 --> 12:24.827

12:24.910 --> 12:28.247

communicate with Sudarikov.

12:28.330 --> 12:31.041
No, no way! Shashi hates Sudarikov.

12:31.125 --> 12:34.086
This wasn't a breakout.
It was a kidnapping, I know it.

Oh, hey there, Mr. Dhar. You're up!

12:54.190 --> 12:56.192
Come on, call me Shashi.

12:56.275 --> 12:59.445
Ah, that's probably not appropriate,
given the circumstances.

12:59.528 --> 13:01.655
Did Sudarikov take you too?

13:01.739 --> 13:04.742
Short answer:
after you were thrown in prison,

13:04.825 --> 13:08.787
I was a boat without a rudder,
floating aimlessly in the criminal sea.

13:08.871 --> 13:13.083
[Rusty] That is, until a certain Muscovite
and his owl came to swoop me up,

13:13.167 --> 13:15.586
like that sweet chariot of song--

13:15.669 --> 13:18.589
Okay, Rusty.
What does Sudarikov want with me?

13:18.672 --> 13:22.426
Bup-bup! There you go again. Interrupting.

13:24.011 --> 13:26.096
-Ask the man himself.
-[tense music plays]

13:26.680 --> 13:28.349
Privyet, Shashi!

13:28.432 --> 13:33.604
I have fun game for you to play
when you arrive, old friend!

[Sudarikov laughs]

13:37.566 --> 13:41.654
-Where are we even headed, Ms. Nowhere?
-We're just gonna fly around looking?

13:41.737 --> 13:45.407
We know where Sudarikov's island base is.
That's as good a place to look as any.

13:47.243 --> 13:50.454
-[Gary] Palindrome!
-Gare-Bear. Jule-Mule.

13:50.538 --> 13:52.206
We've missed you!

13:52.289 --> 13:55.417
This isn't a cuddle party.
What's the update on Sudarikov?

13:55.501 --> 13:57.044
Well, I have some intel,

13:57.127 --> 14:00.673
but first, maybe we should talk about
what happened before you left.

14:00.756 --> 14:01.757
Update!

14:01.840 --> 14:04.218
I hate it when Mom and Dad fight.

14:04.301 --> 14:07.012
It looks like
Sudarikov's prototype is complete.

14:07.096 --> 14:08.097
What is the weapon?

14:08.180 --> 14:12.059
I don't know, but he's got some sort of
obstacle course set up to test it.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.937
[Sudarikov] Also, a plane just landed.

14:15.020 --> 14:16.313
Shashi's here.

14:16.397 --> 14:17.940
[suspenseful music plays]

14:23.529 --> 14:25.030
What is Rusty doing with him?

I don't know,
but they're not working together.

I'm going to patch it through.

14:33.747 --> 14:36.125
What do you want with me? Why am I here?

14:36.208 --> 14:39.295
Because you are one of
the best drivers in the world,

14:39.378 --> 14:41.881
and I need you to test something for me.

14:42.464 --> 14:43.549
So I'm a guinea pig?

14:44.133 --> 14:47.970

[revving]

14:57.813 --> 14:59.648
[tense music plays]

15:00.608 --> 15:02.776
Sudarikov's superweapon is a car.

15:03.360 --> 15:06.780
-We gotta save Shashi.
-Engage hypersonic boosters!

15:07.615 --> 15:09.283
Is there a button for that, or what?

15:09.366 --> 15:14.747
If you can stay alive for five minutes,
then you are free to go.

15:14.830 --> 15:17.374
But if you cannot stay alive…

15:18.000 --> 15:21.712
Well, then you die.
Rule of game pretty simple.

15:21.795 --> 15:25.758
You're telling me all I have to do
is play keep-away with a car?

15:26.383 --> 15:27.718
I was born for this.

15:27.801 --> 15:31.680
Ah, but this is not like
the car you waved in my face

15:31.764 --> 15:33.265
