Ah.

00:35.912 --> 00:38.252
Uh-huh.

00:40.875 --> 00:42.440
Hey Tray, you holdin'?

00:42.644 --> 00:44.195
You know I got you, boo.

00:44.746 --> 00:46.426
If I ain't got it, I'ma get it.

00:46.427 --> 00:47.805
Let me get that dub.

00:49.864 --> 00:51.647
You know I got that good stuff over here.

00:51.870 --> 00:53.403
Tell a friend, and tell a friend.

00:53.405 --> 00:54.915
Lemon drops and it drops.

00:55.708 --> 00:57.106
You know what it is.

00:58.354 --> 00:59.504
Thanks, Dad.

01:00.512 --> 01:02.779
Thanks, Dad.

01:02.781 --> 01:04.616
Aaaaaah!

01:08.420 --> 01:12.300
A ruffled mind makes a restless pillow.

01:13.258 --> 01:15.226
The [BLEEP] you talking about, Gustavo?

01:15.227 --> 01:16.956
Mind your own damn business!

01:25.356 --> 01:26.912
Come on, Amira. Pick up.

01:33.311 --> 01:34.643
This is family time.

01:34.645 --> 01:36.278
Don't even think about
answering that phone.

01:36.280 --> 01:37.636
You know my rules.

01:37.762 --> 01:39.049
I support you, Mom.

01:39.175 --> 01:40.850
If you want to do family time,

01:40.851 --> 01:43.753
let's do family time.

01:44.059 --> 01:46.325
<i>Hi. You've reached Amira.
Please leave a message.</i>

01:49.493 --> 01:51.393
Now, we can play some fun board games

01:51.395 --> 01:53.963
like "Monopoly" or
"Cards Against Humanity,"

01:53.965 --> 01:56.098
or we can make up our own song.

01:56.100 --> 01:57.366
We can have a dance battle.

01:57.368 --> 01:58.667
I've been watching YouTube videos,

01:58.669 --> 02:00.903
so I will kill y'all in a dance battle.

02:00.905 --> 02:02.404
Eh! Look how Mama do it.

02:02.406 --> 02:04.239
Ooh! Y'all can't see me.

02:05.384 --> 02:06.376
No?

02:10.098 --> 02:13.391
Alright, well, based
off the energy in here,

02:13.726 --> 02:14.992
I'ma keep it real basic

02:14.994 --> 02:16.954
and we can just watch television.

02:16.986 --> 02:18.136
- That one.
- Yep.

02:18.420 --> 02:19.655
Alright.

02:19.866 --> 02:21.365
Well, let's watch "Greenleaf."

02:21.367 --> 02:22.933
My girlfriends have been watching it,

02:22.935 --> 02:25.202
and I want to see what
they're talking about.

02:25.323 --> 02:27.256
Isn't that on the OWN network?

02:27.306 --> 02:28.368
Mm-hmm.

02:28.393 --> 02:29.592
We don't have it.

02:29.594 --> 02:31.801
- We don't?
- We don't have anything.

02:31.829 --> 02:33.229
I'm pretty sure we can just

02:33.231 --> 02:34.997
buy the first season online.

02:35.667 --> 02:38.406
I do not want to watch
"Greenleaf" on no computer.

02:38.703 --> 02:40.603
Ma, I'll just mirror it to the TV.

02:40.605 --> 02:41.838
I just think you can do better.

02:41.840 --> 02:43.376
In fact, I know you can do better.

02:44.576 --> 02:46.342
Dad, what's your password?

02:46.344 --> 02:48.057
Uh, "ShaysBae."

02:48.443 --> 02:49.843
ShaysBae!

02:50.115 --> 02:52.211
Ooh, thank you, boo-boo!

02:53.450 --> 02:54.671
What? Okay.

02:56.155 --> 02:57.253
Who's on the phone?

02:57.806 --> 02:58.901
It's nothing.

02:59.524 --> 03:00.990
Alright. I got it.

03:00.992 --> 03:03.393
Y'all want to watch YouTube videos of goats

03:03.395 --> 03:05.061
head-butting people in their junk?

03:05.063 --> 03:07.360
Boy, we watching "Greenleaf."

03:08.400 --> 03:10.600
Josh, come on. You're missing family time.

03:10.602 --> 03:12.261
I got to take this call outside.

03:13.087 --> 03:14.403
Outside?

03:14.939 --> 03:16.519
"Greenleaf" it is.

03:26.162 --> 03:27.884
Hey. You made this wrong.

03:27.886 --> 03:29.352
I asked for extra caramel.

03:29.354 --> 03:30.787
I gave you extra caramel.

03:30.789 --> 03:32.422
Yeah, well, I can't even taste it.

03:32.424 --> 03:33.854
Really, it's not that hard.

03:34.096 --> 03:35.473
You want extra caramel?

03:36.227 --> 03:37.260
- Oh.
- What the...

03:38.329 --> 03:39.395
Let me see your manager.

03:39.397 --> 03:40.951
- We got a problem?
- No.

03:40.952 --> 03:42.409
- We got a problem?!
- No.

03:50.328 --> 03:51.627
The hell was that, Tray?

03:51.692 --> 03:54.391
The customer just caught me at a bad time.

03:57.707 --> 03:59.169
What's going on with you?

04:00.104 --> 04:02.254
My daughter. She mad at me.

04:03.332 --> 04:04.826
She ain't called me back.

04:05.831 --> 04:07.143
I feel like she done with me.

04:07.145 --> 04:08.656
Got me all [BLEEP] up.

04:09.089 --> 04:10.848
Well, I don't care what you going through.

04:10.849 --> 04:13.562
We cannot have you
threatening my customers.

04:13.651 --> 04:16.096
Do not [BLEEP] up my business, Tray.

04:17.680 --> 04:19.522
All you care about is your business,

04:19.524 --> 04:21.824
and I just told you my
daughter ain't speaking to me?

04:21.826 --> 04:24.150
That's personal. This is business.

04:24.999 --> 04:27.764
Now, don't be bringing that
prison mentality up in here.

04:27.766 --> 04:30.466
I don't want no parts of
no thug shit up in here.

04:30.468 --> 04:32.268
You was the grimiest
nigga in the neighborhood.

04:32.270 --> 04:33.569
You better keep your voice down.

04:33.571 --> 04:35.350
Grimiest nigga in the neighborhood.

04:35.607 --> 04:37.043
And you gonna judge me?

04:37.044 --> 04:39.344
Now, I know it's been tough for you.

04:39.346 --> 04:40.494
No, you don't.

04:41.549 --> 04:44.216
Wavy, it wasn't tough. It was hell!

04:44.317 --> 04:46.817
And don't forget, I got
locked up selling your crack,

04:46.820 --> 04:47.986
so don't get it twisted.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.087
Yo, my man.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.406
Don't you put your hands in my face.

04:52.192 --> 04:53.530
Now I know you're upset,

04:53.944 --> 04:56.985
so I'ma let that slide, alright?

04:58.098 --> 04:59.807
But for the next few days, you off.

04:59.832 --> 05:01.900
- You ain't working.
- Come on, Wavy, man.

05:02.108 --> 05:04.141
I can't take no days off. I need the money.

05:04.166 --> 05:06.171
Then you better watch your [BLEEP] mouth.

05:06.173 --> 05:08.163
And don't bite the hand that feeds you.

05:09.644 --> 05:11.348
Now, if you want to keep this job,

05:11.858 --> 05:13.732
you better show me some respect.

05:14.699 --> 05:15.879
Understood?

05:16.726 --> 05:17.867
Understood.

05:18.942 --> 05:21.194
Get the [BLEEP] out of here.
Take your ass home.

05:22.345 --> 05:24.312
And I better see a new attitude from you

05:24.314 --> 05:25.646
when I see you next week.

05:25.891 --> 05:27.795
[BLEEP] with my money, nigga.

05:28.807 --> 05:31.807
<i>Why won't you let me do a series?</i>

05:31.988 --> 05:33.988
- <i>Jacob just did that one...</i>

05:33.990 --> 05:35.523
<i>on running the race or...</i>

05:35.525 --> 05:37.391
What the [BLEEP]?

05:39.329 --> 05:40.695
<i>It's not like</i> he's good...

05:40.697 --> 05:41.729
Josh!

05:41.731 --> 05:42.964
<i>Come on, Charity.</i>

05:42.966 --> 05:45.900
There he is. He's going somewhere.

05:45.902 --> 05:48.269
<i>Your daddy's made his position clear, girl.</i>

05:48.271 --> 05:49.570
<i>Sit your ass down.</i>

05:49.572 --> 05:51.038
<i>Don't talk to her like that.</i>

05:51.040 --> 05:52.506
<i>Don't you talk to your uncle like that.</i>

05:52.508 --> 05:53.507
<i>Daddy, I think...</i>

05:53.509 --> 05:55.024
Mm-hmm.

05:55.025 --> 05:56.091
<i>Gigi!</i>

05:56.359 --> 05:58.393
Okay, if you're going, then I'm going, too.

05:58.395 --> 05:59.761
If he's doing something crazy,

05:59.763 --> 06:01.830
I cannot risk the fact
that you could kill him.

06:02.095 --> 06:04.340
Sweetie, baby girl, look at me.

06:04.365 --> 06:06.368
I am not mad. I'm smiling.

06:06.369 --> 06:08.570
Look, we already had
one parent incarcerated.

06:08.572 --> 06:09.704
We don't need another.

06:09.943 --> 06:11.539
- Boy, bye.
- Hey, hey, hey.

06:11.541 --> 06:13.052
You don't have any shoes on.

06:15.314 --> 06:17.048
Go get my Reeboks.

06:18.515 --> 06:21.416
Look, I'm going with you because
you need me to go with you.

06:21.418 --> 06:22.684
- Shahzad?
- Nah, I'm cool.

06:22.708 --> 06:24.120
Gonna stay here and watch "Greenleaf".

06:24.448 --> 06:25.544
Good show.

06:26.018 --> 06:27.789
<i>Mama, the truth...</i>

06:32.064 --> 06:35.255
That son of a... I need to breathe.

06:35.256 --> 06:37.223
Breathe, Shannon. Breathe. You got this.

06:38.292 --> 06:40.630
This is so disappointing.

06:40.950 --> 06:42.701
I mean, this isn't like Dad.

06:43.354 --> 06:45.030
You know, I always thought that white men

06:45.032 --> 06:47.791
who dated black women were
supposed to be more dependable.

06:47.935 --> 06:49.702
Well, Robin Thicke.

06:50.127 --> 06:52.138
Mm. True, true.

06:52.522 --> 06:53.744
I need to know the truth.

06:53.745 --> 06:57.201
I just want to see what's
going on with my own eyes.

06:57.980 --> 06:59.512
I mean, let's be real for a second.

06:59.515 --> 07:00.650
This is Dad.

07:01.106 --> 07:02.773
I don't think he would cheat.

07:02.916 --> 07:04.254
Me neither, sweetie.

07:04.451 --> 07:07.618
But he hasn't answered
any of my calls or texts,

07:07.620 --> 07:11.055
he's been evasive, and
now he's having lunch

07:11.057 --> 07:13.624
with a young, white girl

07:13.626 --> 07:16.360
in front of my goddamn eyes!

07:17.897 --> 07:19.730
Are we about to do a
drive-by or something?

07:19.732 --> 07:20.932
Look, I'm not cut out for all that.

07:20.934 --> 07:22.467
Don't bitch out on me now, girl.

07:22.469 --> 07:24.135
You made a choice in that house.

07:24.375 --> 07:27.138
We both did, and we going
down this rabbit hole together.

07:28.274 --> 07:30.475
That man got a sexy text message

07:30.477 --> 07:32.810
from another bitch at our house.

07:33.043 --> 07:35.428
I'm not letting that ride. Mnh-mnh.

07:35.720 --> 07:37.932
Can we at least call him? One more time.

07:40.854 --> 07:43.588
Okay. I'll try.

07:52.082 --> 07:53.267
Mm-hmm. Look.

07:54.100 --> 07:56.200
Oh, no. Is he texting?

08:02.453 --> 08:05.267
"Call you in a bit. Luv ya."

08:05.778 --> 08:06.827
Oh.

08:07.413 --> 08:09.113
I'm going into "Predator" mode.

08:09.115 --> 08:10.515
I can feel it.

08:12.285 --> 08:14.215
He is so dead.

08:15.355 --> 08:17.421
They leaving. Playing games.

08:17.423 --> 08:19.490
They're messing with the wrong one today.

08:19.492 --> 08:21.893
Put your seatbelt on.
Somebody might get hit.

08:31.104 --> 08:32.289
Amira.

08:32.785 --> 08:34.071
It's me, Tray.

08:34.073 --> 08:35.230
I'm sorry.

08:35.375 --> 08:37.010
I'm sorry for letting you down.

08:37.376 --> 08:39.143
Please get back at me, Amira.

08:39.145 --> 08:41.227
It's me, your da... I mean, Tray.

08:42.282 --> 08:44.492
Tray. Please get back at me.

08:45.289 --> 08:46.388
Thank you.

08:49.300 --> 08:52.109
- Problems with your daughter?
- Teenagers, man.

08:52.141 --> 08:54.559
You need to stop saying the
word "teenager," Gustavo!

08:54.773 --> 08:56.305
It sound dirty when you use it.

08:56.307 --> 08:58.341
- Adolescents?
- Tray, you salty today.

08:58.343 --> 09:00.376
Hey, you mother[BLEEP] in this halfway house

09:00.378 --> 09:01.944
is some nosy dudes, man.

09:02.118 --> 09:03.418
Can't even make a phone call!

09:03.420 --> 09:04.953
Hey, we're just worried about you, buddy.

09:04.955 --> 09:07.021
Yeah, worry about yourself. Look at you.

09:07.023 --> 09:09.478
You got a Tasmanian body
with skinny legs, man.

09:09.503 --> 09:11.287
- Okay.
- That's a heart-attack body.

09:11.628 --> 09:14.770
Parker, you got a visitor
downstairs at the door.

09:14.795 --> 09:16.880
Look like a young Lando Calrissian.

09:17.151 --> 09:18.722
Yeah, well, move out my way, man.

09:19.865 --> 09:20.981
Bobby.

09:21.789 --> 09:23.022
What you doing here, man?

09:23.061 --> 09:24.245
I ain't got nothing to say to you.

09:24.270 --> 09:26.444
Just let me holla at you
for a minute, alright?

09:26.810 --> 09:30.103
Look, I just wanted to apologize
for my outlandish behavior,

09:30.280 --> 09:31.975
so I brought you this.

09:32.983 --> 09:34.843
What you bring me meats for, Bobby?

09:34.844 --> 09:36.061
You know why.

09:36.145 --> 09:37.711
I was acting like an idiot.

09:38.309 --> 09:40.034
I got caught up in the game...

09:41.457 --> 09:42.683
and I'm sorry, cuz-o.

09:43.696 --> 09:45.477
This is my peace offering, man.

09:46.413 --> 09:50.295
And nothing says sorry
like a plate of meat and...

09:52.984 --> 09:55.596
two VIP tickets to the strip club, son.

09:55.771 --> 09:58.755
Unlimited lap dances and a free prime rib.

09:58.757 --> 09:59.990
Now, we got to get there early

09:59.992 --> 10:01.391
'cause you know they gon' run out.

10:01.393 --> 10:02.702
You know how they do, baby.

10:04.129 --> 10:05.729
Not in the mood for no strip club, man.

10:05.731 --> 10:07.693
I'm not in the right head space, man.

10:08.033 --> 10:10.418
So, please, Bobby, leave. Go home.

10:12.323 --> 10:15.205
Look, like, I know you
depressed right now...

10:15.207 --> 10:16.591
I'm not depressed.

10:16.709 --> 10:19.776
I'm sad and I'm angry and I can't help

10:19.778 --> 10:21.588
but start arguments with people.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.758
So get the [BLEEP] out of here.

10:26.585 --> 10:27.784
Okay. I unde... I understand

10:27.786 --> 10:30.399
that you need your personal space and...

10:31.623 --> 10:33.259
time for emotional healing.

10:34.380 --> 10:35.331
But look.

10:36.416 --> 10:37.845
Ever since Clyde died...

10:40.653 --> 10:42.159
you are all I got, cuz-o.

10:53.433 --> 10:56.033
I see you got four different
types of ham in there.

10:56.035 --> 10:57.717
Two different types of turkey.

10:58.371 --> 11:00.071
Got some liverwurst in there, too, huh?

11:00.652 --> 11:01.872
Give me that shit, man.

11:01.874 --> 11:03.537
You wouldn't know what to do with it.

11:05.126 --> 11:06.202
Go home, Bobby.

11:08.463 --> 11:10.752
Nosy-ass people out here!

11:11.332 --> 11:12.359
Damn!

11:23.946 --> 11:26.197
Can't believe what I'm seeing right now!

11:27.255 --> 11:28.688
- Girl, give me that.
- What?

11:28.713 --> 11:31.350
You are not about to put
our family's dirty laundry

11:31.385 --> 11:32.752
on the Internet.

11:32.754 --> 11:34.023
Now, don't be afraid.

11:34.763 --> 11:36.769
We about to go upstream on this together.

11:36.794 --> 11:39.635
We up the river, boo,
and it's gonna get messy.

11:39.661 --> 11:41.527
It might get messy, it might not get messy,

11:41.529 --> 11:43.329
but I'm pretty sure it's gon' get messy.

11:43.642 --> 11:46.145
Look, Mom, I'm pissed
off about this chick, too.

11:46.668 --> 11:50.485
But what if we're wrong?
I mean, we could be wrong.

11:51.446 --> 11:54.440
I'm gon' bust in there
like the Kool-Aid Man!

11:56.511 --> 11:58.478
I have never seen this side of you,

11:58.785 --> 12:00.517
and it is really scary.

12:00.792 --> 12:02.689
Aw, don't be scared, sweetie.

12:03.785 --> 12:05.941
I'm just working through this right now.

12:06.521 --> 12:09.221
Just remember, women are strong.

12:09.429 --> 12:12.758
No matter what happens
to us, we will overcome.

12:13.184 --> 12:16.307
Uh-huh. We will. Man or no man.

12:16.764 --> 12:19.238
I'm just working through the
five stages of grief right now.

12:19.834 --> 12:22.824
And right now, I'm on stage two.

12:23.638 --> 12:25.271
Which one is stage two?

12:25.273 --> 12:26.390
Anger!

12:26.674 --> 12:28.374
But wait till I get to
the acceptance stage.

12:28.376 --> 12:30.776
That's when I'll have my makeup all perfect

12:30.778 --> 12:33.179
and I'll have that Mary
J. Blige breakup body.

12:33.350 --> 12:36.586
But first things first,
we got to finish stage two.

12:36.715 --> 12:39.082
- Let's go.
- Oh. Okay. I'm... I'm going.

12:39.462 --> 12:41.028
- It's nice.
- Do you want anything to drink or...

12:41.197 --> 12:42.997
- No, I'm good.
- Okay.

12:42.999 --> 12:44.897
I'm good. It's nice.

12:44.898 --> 12:47.699
Walls really pop. This is cool.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.045
What the... Hello?

12:50.570 --> 12:51.735
Aaah!

12:51.737 --> 12:54.371
Caught you red-handed, mother[BLEEP]

12:54.373 --> 12:56.340
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, Shannon.

12:56.342 --> 12:57.675
Hey, Dad.

12:57.677 --> 12:59.176
Hi. Hey.

12:59.178 --> 13:01.745
Wait, Dad? This is your wife?

13:01.747 --> 13:03.047
Damn right, I am.

13:03.049 --> 13:04.481
- Oh, my name's Emily.
- Oh, no, no, no.

13:04.483 --> 13:06.784
Bitch, I don't care if
your name is Gilbert Grape.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.118
Why you [BLEEP] my husband?

13:08.120 --> 13:11.188
Whoa! No! You are so wrong.

13:11.190 --> 13:13.691
What did you think I was doing?
You think I'm cheating on you?

13:13.693 --> 13:15.018
Yeah, she did.

13:15.328 --> 13:17.813
Oh, wow. Did you follow me here?

13:17.930 --> 13:19.604
Yeah, we did.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.876
- Snitch.
- I mean...

13:23.396 --> 13:25.625
Okay, everybody, let's
just take a deep breath.

13:27.111 --> 13:28.477
'Cause clearly,

13:28.479 --> 13:31.135
you guys aren't actively
having sex right now,

13:31.603 --> 13:32.902
but I need some answers.

13:33.481 --> 13:35.405
I sponsor Emily at Narc-Anon.

13:35.851 --> 13:39.009
I was doing a sweep to make
sure there were no drugs here.

13:39.260 --> 13:41.279
I have to make sure that she's clean.

13:41.495 --> 13:42.581
Well,

13:43.629 --> 13:45.733
that's not what it looked
like up in here and... and...

13:45.870 --> 13:46.926
- Yeah?
- I...

13:47.058 --> 13:49.283
You can stop now. Just let it sink in.

13:49.503 --> 13:51.436
That's alright. Just let it sink in.

13:51.438 --> 13:52.880
Wow, Shannon.

13:53.007 --> 13:55.173
Shannon, you screwed
up big time, didn't ya?

13:55.175 --> 13:56.508
Well, you must be hiding something

13:56.510 --> 13:58.677
'cause you didn't answer any of my calls.

13:58.679 --> 14:00.248
She was in a crisis!

14:00.355 --> 14:01.771
What's Narc-Anon?

14:03.759 --> 14:04.821
Tell her.

14:09.923 --> 14:12.840
Alright. Listen, uh, sweetie.

14:13.794 --> 14:15.394
Before I met your mother,

14:15.396 --> 14:17.525
before you kids were even born,

14:17.795 --> 14:20.397
I had an addiction to heroin.

14:20.940 --> 14:22.066
Whoa.

14:22.700 --> 14:24.333
Wait. You knew about this?

14:24.742 --> 14:25.780
Yeah.

14:26.137 --> 14:29.428
It's okay. That's okay.
It's part of who I am.

14:29.640 --> 14:30.973
That's just the way it is.

14:31.108 --> 14:33.008
I kicked it, and I've been clean

14:33.010 --> 14:36.534
for a very, very long time.

14:37.081 --> 14:39.686
But I still need to go to
meetings, and so does Emily.

14:40.738 --> 14:42.037
I'm her sponsor.

14:42.416 --> 14:44.450
But if you would have
just answered the phone...

14:44.452 --> 14:45.818
- No. Don't. Stop it.
- None of this would have even happened.

14:45.820 --> 14:47.219
- Shannon, stop it.
- I'm just sayin'.

14:47.221 --> 14:48.497
Don't change the subject.

14:48.498 --> 14:51.433
We could have avoided all of
this if you had just trusted me,

14:51.435 --> 14:52.934
instead of breaking down the door

14:52.936 --> 14:54.703
and acting like a crazy person.

14:54.705 --> 14:55.904
- Crazy?
- Yeah, crazy.

14:55.906 --> 14:57.517
I'd rather be crazy than jealous.

14:57.518 --> 15:00.185
Okay. You're a black woman.

15:00.187 --> 15:02.154
- You need to act like it.
- Pardon me?!

15:02.156 --> 15:04.351
No, no, I think he meant
that as a compliment...

15:04.805 --> 15:06.604
- didn't you, Dad?
- Of course I did.

15:06.719 --> 15:08.939
Yeah, I hold black women
to a higher standard.

15:09.411 --> 15:12.335
Well, somehow, I am offended by that.

15:12.539 --> 15:13.838
I just want to say,

15:13.840 --> 15:16.341
um, that Josh has always been there for me.

15:16.343 --> 15:17.342
Mnh-mnh.

15:17.575 --> 15:18.643
He's great.

15:18.645 --> 15:19.685
Mm.

15:20.614 --> 15:22.203
Get your hand off my man.

15:22.734 --> 15:24.026
Get on, Becky.

15:26.314 --> 15:27.318
Okay.

15:28.599 --> 15:30.455
Group of savages, man.

15:30.712 --> 15:33.165
Y'all a bunch of barbarians, man.

15:33.489 --> 15:36.528
Gustavo, you are ruining my cold-cut tray.

15:36.766 --> 15:40.347
Stop double-dipping.
You only get to dip once.

15:41.300 --> 15:43.803
It's all good. Gustavo don't have germs.

15:45.500 --> 15:48.440
Country, you need to slow
your ass down, too, man.

15:48.687 --> 15:51.176
That's all you need is
more sodium in your diet.

15:51.276 --> 15:52.603
Normally, I'd be mad,

15:52.980 --> 15:54.312
but I know you're just lashing out

15:54.314 --> 15:56.507
'cause you're depressed, so I forgive you.

15:56.717 --> 15:58.452
There ain't nobody depressed.

15:58.685 --> 16:00.185
That's what depressed people say.

16:00.187 --> 16:01.226
Mm-hmm.

16:02.412 --> 16:05.590
This right here is textbook depressed.

16:05.592 --> 16:07.626
Eating your feelings,
I believe, is the term.

16:07.628 --> 16:08.893
Mm-hmm.

16:10.831 --> 16:13.303
Is that pimento loaf I smell up in here?

16:13.700 --> 16:14.979
Oh, yeah.

16:15.102 --> 16:16.801
Somebody gave Tray a cold-cut platter

16:16.803 --> 16:18.075
'cause he's depressed.

16:18.205 --> 16:20.939
Aw, hell. What you done
did now, dicklicker?

16:21.083 --> 16:24.184
Easy, Mullins. Look at
him. He's in rough shape.

16:24.391 --> 16:26.279
Of course he is. His life is in shambles.

16:26.280 --> 16:29.314
Look at him. You backsliding. I can see it.

16:29.465 --> 16:32.391
He exactly one dick hair away
from going back to prison.

16:32.535 --> 16:34.301
It won't be long 'fore you're all mixed up

16:34.303 --> 16:36.761
with some criminal
enterprise all over again.

16:37.072 --> 16:39.805
That's what depressed ex-convicts do.

16:40.176 --> 16:41.945
You got to watch out for that backsliding.

16:42.529 --> 16:43.998
It ain't easy out here, is it?

16:45.569 --> 16:46.780
Is that Black Forest?

16:49.452 --> 16:50.551
Amira.

16:50.553 --> 16:51.634
Scoot over.

16:52.311 --> 16:54.977
Amira. Amira! Amir...

16:56.826 --> 16:58.992
Yeah, the cellphone service
in here is some bullshit.

16:58.994 --> 17:00.661
I usually get, like, like, two bars.

17:00.797 --> 17:03.123
Well, I'ma go outside to see
if I can get a better signal.

17:03.232 --> 17:04.744
That was my daughter, kid.

17:05.034 --> 17:06.856
Shit, that's probably a butt-dial.

17:10.960 --> 17:13.941
Yo, this oldest daughter is trouble.

17:13.943 --> 17:15.342
She need to go back to Phoenix.

17:17.413 --> 17:19.313
I can't believe you're acting

17:19.315 --> 17:20.646
like you didn't do anything wrong.

17:20.648 --> 17:22.883
I didn't! You're being ridiculous!

17:22.885 --> 17:23.895
You're being ridiculo...

17:23.920 --> 17:25.152
Oh, don't call me...
don't call me ridiculous.

17:25.154 --> 17:26.787
- Well, I just did 'cause you are.
- Guys! Guys!

17:27.852 --> 17:29.591
I'm watching something here. Thank you.

17:29.592 --> 17:31.525
What? This is a little more important

17:31.527 --> 17:33.160
than your little TV show, Shahzad.

17:33.381 --> 17:35.081
Mom and Dad are about to get a divorce.

17:35.106 --> 17:37.573
Did I hear somebody mention
divorce? What's happening?

17:37.575 --> 17:39.012
What are you doing here, Tray?

17:39.013 --> 17:40.181
Amira call me.

17:40.229 --> 17:41.595
What? No, I didn't.

17:41.597 --> 17:43.096
Girl, I just ran all the way over here.

17:43.098 --> 17:44.565
You sure you didn't call me?

17:44.567 --> 17:46.400
Oh, it must have been a
butt-dial or something.

17:46.599 --> 17:47.765
No, we're in the middle of some

17:47.817 --> 17:49.261
really serious drama right now.

17:49.286 --> 17:51.386
Okay, I'm done. Bye.

17:51.523 --> 17:52.755
Where do you think you're going?

17:52.757 --> 17:54.624
No, you're not storming off now. No.

17:54.626 --> 17:57.927
Either you have to get over it or I can go.

17:57.929 --> 18:01.130
Oh, well, go. Go over to that
old bucket-ass bitch house.

18:01.132 --> 18:02.398
- Oh, come on.
- What's her name, Emily?

18:02.400 --> 18:04.808
- Go to Emily's house.
- Emily? Who's Emily?

18:04.833 --> 18:06.742
Oh, Dad used to be a heroin addict.

18:06.838 --> 18:07.837
What?

18:08.493 --> 18:09.840
No, no, no, no, no.

18:09.841 --> 18:12.208
I have been... I've been clean for years.

18:12.210 --> 18:13.810
I go to meetings, I have my shit together.

18:13.812 --> 18:15.378
- That's not the point.
- Mm-hmm.

18:15.380 --> 18:18.347
And he sponsors ugly
white bitches named Emily

18:18.349 --> 18:20.149
- and doesn't tell me about it.
- Oh, my God.

18:20.151 --> 18:22.719
Well, Emily has a little crush
on Dad, so there's that, too.

18:22.721 --> 18:25.389
No, Emily does not have a crush on Dad.

18:25.488 --> 18:27.255
That girl is thirsty, Dad.

18:27.257 --> 18:29.123
Mm-hmm. It's very obvious, Josh.

18:29.125 --> 18:31.742
Everybody wait five goddamn seconds!

18:32.562 --> 18:35.580
You mean to tell me
Josh is a heroin addict?

18:35.581 --> 18:37.050
This Josh right here?

18:37.284 --> 18:39.763
Josh is riding the white horse?

18:40.275 --> 18:41.966
Giddyup, giddyup horse?

18:42.680 --> 18:44.012
Wow!

18:44.703 --> 18:46.636
Wow!

18:48.269 --> 18:50.652
Hey, you know what, Tray?
You can leave right now.

18:50.654 --> 18:53.021
I will leave, but I just
want to say it one more time.

18:53.023 --> 18:54.374
Wow!

18:54.792 --> 18:56.825
Josh used to be a "heron" addict...

18:56.827 --> 18:59.783
Excuse me... <i>Is</i> a heron addict!

18:59.897 --> 19:02.403
'Cause you know what they
say about heron, Josh...

19:02.404 --> 19:04.771
You try it once, you hooked from here on.

19:04.976 --> 19:08.107
You know what this means,
right? I'm not that bad.

19:08.109 --> 19:09.976
Really? That's the lesson?

19:09.978 --> 19:11.344
Man, I'm not that bad.

19:11.346 --> 19:14.417
Shit, I sold crack, but I'm not that bad.

19:14.418 --> 19:16.285
Wait a minute. "Sold."

19:16.784 --> 19:19.086
"Sold" as in past tense, right?

19:20.413 --> 19:23.341
Listen, Shahzad, Amira.

19:24.533 --> 19:25.732
I made a mistake,

19:25.991 --> 19:29.002
but one thing I never did,

19:29.507 --> 19:30.990
I never used it.

19:31.875 --> 19:33.441
Not like this fiend!

19:34.158 --> 19:36.577
Tray, get the [BLEEP] out of my house.

19:36.844 --> 19:39.418
Yeah, fine. I'm good. I'm gone. I'ma ghost.

19:39.443 --> 19:40.432
Good.

19:40.457 --> 19:42.250
You know I came here feeling low,

19:42.950 --> 19:45.888
and it feels damn good to
know your ass struggled, too.

19:46.120 --> 19:47.386
Struggle!

19:48.158 --> 19:49.555
And just do me one favor

19:49.557 --> 19:50.990
before I go, okay, Josh?

19:50.992 --> 19:52.591
Don't use the dope in front of my kids.

19:52.593 --> 19:54.499
They precious to me. That's my world.

19:54.789 --> 19:56.603
Alright? Drugs are no-no.

19:56.864 --> 19:58.428
