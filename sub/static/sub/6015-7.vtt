00:03.404 --> 00:06.043
There's always one location
in your neighbourhood, one store...

00:06.204 --> 00:08.513
...that's constantly changing hands.

00:08.724 --> 00:11.238
Everybody has this in their
neighbourhood. It's a leather store...

00:11.404 --> 00:13.520
...then it's a yoghurt shop,
it's a pet supply.

00:13.684 --> 00:16.039
It's constantly changing.
Nobody can do business there.

00:16.204 --> 00:18.513
It's like some sort of
Bermuda Triangle of retail.

00:18.684 --> 00:22.757
Stores open up and then
they just disappear without a trace.

00:22.924 --> 00:24.323
Nobody knows what happened.

00:24.484 --> 00:28.602
Eventually, when aliens land and the
mothership from Close Encounters...

00:28.804 --> 00:32.353
The bottom will slowly open and all
these store owners will wander out...

00:32.524 --> 00:36.358
...in a daze, going, " I thought there
was gonna be more walk-in traffic."

00:39.164 --> 00:40.153
She thinks I'm nice.

00:42.404 --> 00:43.803
- Women don't want nice.
- Amazing.

00:43.964 --> 00:46.717
I haven't seen one person go in
that restaurant since it opened.

00:47.044 --> 00:49.922
- Poor guy.
- Why is nice bad?

00:50.084 --> 00:53.121
What kind of a sick society are
we living in when nice is bad?

00:53.284 --> 00:55.002
What's that smell?
What are you wearing?

00:55.164 --> 00:56.916
What? A little cologne.

00:57.284 --> 00:58.319
Manly.

00:58.524 --> 01:00.799
- Monica wants me to wear it.
- Why didn't you say no?

01:00.964 --> 01:02.192
I'm too nice.

01:02.364 --> 01:05.436
Look at this poor guy. His family's
probably back in Pakistan waiting...

01:05.604 --> 01:07.037
...for him to send back money.

01:07.204 --> 01:09.115
This is horrible.

01:09.284 --> 01:10.558
She wants me to take an IQ test.

01:10.724 --> 01:13.192
It's because you're stupid enough
to wear the cologne.

01:13.564 --> 01:17.273
No. She's taking this course
in education for her master's.

01:17.444 --> 01:20.277
It's part of her research project,
so I have to be a guinea pig.

01:20.444 --> 01:23.277
I've never been a guinea pig.
Been a sheep, been a toady...

01:24.004 --> 01:25.403
I can't talk to you anymore.

01:25.564 --> 01:27.998
All right, I'm sorry. Go ahead.
You're taking the IQ test.

01:28.164 --> 01:29.756
She's gonna find out I'm a moron.

01:30.044 --> 01:32.877
People think I'm smart,
but I'm not smart.

01:33.044 --> 01:34.875
Who thinks you're smart?

01:35.044 --> 01:36.636
I won't break 100 on this thing.

01:36.804 --> 01:39.364
- What thing?
- You don't listen anymore.

01:39.524 --> 01:41.355
Oh, the IQ thing. Yeah.

01:42.004 --> 01:43.835
I'm sure I have a low IQ.

01:44.004 --> 01:46.040
I've been lying about my SAT scores
for 15 years.

01:46.204 --> 01:49.196
- What did you get?
- What did I get, or what do I say I got?

01:49.364 --> 01:51.639
- What do you say?
- I say 1409.

01:51.844 --> 01:53.914
- 1409, that's a good score.
- You're telling me.

01:54.084 --> 01:55.676
What did you really get?

01:55.884 --> 01:57.283
- You're my friend.
- Of course.

01:57.444 --> 01:59.196
- I tell you everything, right?
- I hope so.

01:59.364 --> 02:02.276
Well, this I take to the grave.

02:02.604 --> 02:05.164
He's serving Mexican,
Italian, Chinese.

02:05.444 --> 02:07.833
He's all over the place.
That's why no one's going in.

02:08.003 --> 02:09.881
Why do you keep watching?

02:10.044 --> 02:12.160
I don't know. I'm obsessed with it.

02:13.004 --> 02:17.202
It's like a spider in the toilet,
struggling for survival.

02:17.924 --> 02:19.516
And even though you know
he's not gonna make it...

02:19.684 --> 02:21.595
...you root for him for a second.

02:21.764 --> 02:23.197
Then you flush.

02:24.524 --> 02:26.560
Well, it's a spider.

02:27.964 --> 02:29.556
Sometimes people
won't go in a place...

02:29.724 --> 02:32.158
...if they don't see anyone else
in there.

02:32.324 --> 02:36.681
Do you have to do that? Jerry, don't
do that. That is so annoying.

02:37.044 --> 02:38.318
Bazooka Joe.

02:46.644 --> 02:48.600
- The buzzer?
- It's your house.

02:49.244 --> 02:52.634
My house. You gotta be on the lease
to press the buzzer.

02:53.604 --> 02:55.083
- Yeah?
- It's George.

02:55.244 --> 02:56.643
Come on up.

02:56.804 --> 02:59.477
- Casus belli.
- What's that?

02:59.644 --> 03:03.193
It's Latin. I read it in some book.
I just wanted to say it out loud.

03:03.364 --> 03:04.638
Come on, go in.

03:05.164 --> 03:06.756
Go in.

03:07.644 --> 03:10.317
- Have you gone in there?
- No. I'm afraid we'll start talking...

03:10.484 --> 03:12.793
...and I'll wind up going partners
with him.

03:13.564 --> 03:15.043
Hey.

03:21.124 --> 03:24.116
I could probably shoot him from here.
I'd be doing us both a favour.

03:27.804 --> 03:30.682
I'm wearing some cologne, all right?

03:31.004 --> 03:32.801
Sure. Fine.

03:33.164 --> 03:35.041
Casus belli.

03:36.164 --> 03:38.632
Casus belli.

03:39.204 --> 03:41.877
- What's that?
- Since when do you wear cologne?

03:42.044 --> 03:43.636
Why is what I do so important?

03:43.804 --> 03:45.954
Why must I always be the focal point
of attention?

03:46.124 --> 03:47.955
Let me just be. Let me live.

03:49.964 --> 03:52.956
- How'd you do on that IQ test?
- I didn't take it yet.

03:53.124 --> 03:54.762
- What IQ test?
- What's casus belli?

03:54.924 --> 03:58.075
- Oh, it's nothing.
- Is it about me?

03:58.244 --> 04:00.439
Why must you always be
the focal point of attention?

04:00.604 --> 04:03.357
Why can't you just be?
Why can't you live?

04:04.964 --> 04:09.116
It's just a Latin phrase. It does not
mean anything. Now, what is this test?

04:09.284 --> 04:12.401
This woman he's dating is making him
take this IQ test for this course.

04:12.564 --> 04:14.714
- Oh, that sounds like fun.
- Yeah, fun.

04:15.404 --> 04:18.874
IQ tests are totally bogus.
They prove nothing.

04:19.043 --> 04:21.877
- You'll do well. You're smart.
- No, see, he's not smart.

04:22.043 --> 04:25.275
People think he's smart,
but he's not.

04:25.444 --> 04:27.241
What did you get on your SATs?

04:27.884 --> 04:29.556
It varies.

04:30.644 --> 04:34.717
- I don't even know my IQ.
- Mine's 145.

04:35.364 --> 04:38.083
- One forty-five!
- Get out of here.

04:38.244 --> 04:40.474
- You get out of here.
- You get out of here.

04:42.004 --> 04:43.915
Maybe you should take the test for me.

04:44.084 --> 04:47.156
That would be something,
cheating on an IQ test.

04:47.364 --> 04:49.719
Remember in college when you
passed Lettick the test...

04:49.884 --> 04:51.112
...out the window?

04:51.284 --> 04:54.401
- You became a legend after that.
- Yeah.

04:54.564 --> 04:57.283
Yeah, I really had some guts
back then.

04:58.724 --> 05:01.284
- Why don't we do it again?
- What?

05:01.444 --> 05:03.036
You could take the IQ test for me.

05:03.204 --> 05:06.037
I'll pass it to you out of a window.
She lives on the first floor.

05:06.204 --> 05:07.523
- You serious?
- Why not?

05:07.684 --> 05:09.515
Where would I take the test?

05:09.684 --> 05:12.482
She lives around the corner.
Take it here or go to the coffee shop.

05:12.644 --> 05:14.680
- No, too noisy.
- Take it at the Dream Café.

05:14.844 --> 05:16.038
You won't hear a peep.

05:18.684 --> 05:21.039
- Hey, what do you think?
- Hey, I love a good caper.

05:22.564 --> 05:26.716
Yeah, that's what it is, isn't it?
A caper.

05:26.884 --> 05:28.363
You'll do it?

05:29.284 --> 05:31.844
- What the hey.
- Yeah! Beautiful!

05:32.004 --> 05:33.915
Sorry.

05:39.324 --> 05:44.239
- Welcome to the Dream Café.
- Well, I've been looking forward to it.

05:44.404 --> 05:46.554
How did you hear about us?

05:46.724 --> 05:48.635
People. People are talking.

05:50.724 --> 05:53.602
Smoking or nonsmoking?
We are proud to offer both.

05:53.764 --> 05:55.834
- Nonsmoking would be great.
- Very good.

05:56.084 --> 05:59.679
My name is Babu Bhatt.
I will be your waiter.

05:59.964 --> 06:02.558
A steaming hot, folded face cloth
for your pleasure.

06:02.724 --> 06:05.602
- Thank you.
- Our specials are tacos...

06:05.764 --> 06:07.800
...moussaka and franks and beans.

06:09.044 --> 06:11.842
Well, what do you recommend,
my good fellow?

06:12.124 --> 06:14.843
- The turkey.
- Well, the turkey it'll be.

06:15.004 --> 06:17.564
May I say you have a splendid
establishment here, my friend.

06:17.724 --> 06:20.716
I'm sure you'll flourish at this location
for many, many years.

06:20.884 --> 06:23.034
You're a very kind man.
Very kind. Thank you.

06:23.644 --> 06:25.123
Very kind.

06:26.244 --> 06:29.281
Very kind. I am a kind man.

06:29.484 --> 06:32.317
Who else would do something
lik e this? Nobody.

06:32.604 --> 06:34.799
Nobody thinks about people
the way I do.

06:35.244 --> 06:36.643
Snap out of it, you stupid jerk.

06:36.804 --> 06:39.193
You're eating a turk ey sandwich.
You want a Nobel Prize?

06:39.524 --> 06:41.833
You go in the living room,
I'll take the test in here.

06:42.004 --> 06:43.198
But why?

06:43.724 --> 06:45.919
I won't be able to concentrate
in front of you.

06:46.084 --> 06:49.918
I think you're making too much of this.
IQ tests don't mean anything.

06:50.084 --> 06:51.403
Are you kidding me?

06:52.324 --> 06:56.158
This is the best tool we have today
of measuring a person's intelligence.

06:56.324 --> 06:58.884
Well, I certainly don't place
any importance on it.

06:59.044 --> 07:01.114
Well, I think you're wrong about that.

07:02.404 --> 07:06.238
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I'd really like to get started, please.

07:07.044 --> 07:08.443
- Good luck.
- Don't need it.

07:12.644 --> 07:14.794
What's going on?
I've been here 20 minutes.

07:14.964 --> 07:17.080
I'm sorry. Here's the test.
Thanks for doing this.

07:17.244 --> 07:19.997
- What time do you want me back?
- Twenty to 3.

07:20.204 --> 07:21.478
- Okay.
- Thanks again.

07:21.804 --> 07:24.921
And don't settle for 145.
You can do better. You're a genius.

07:31.804 --> 07:33.840
Thank you, Babu.

07:34.724 --> 07:38.797
You have quite a flair. You are
quite the restaurateur, I must say.

07:39.004 --> 07:41.677
- It is indeed my pleasure.
- Oh, please.

07:42.724 --> 07:45.522
Welcome to the Dream Café.

07:46.204 --> 07:49.514
- Our specials today...
- Oh, no, no. I'll just have tea and toast.

07:50.844 --> 07:53.677
- Tea and toast.
- Eat something! Babu.

07:55.124 --> 07:56.318
Okay.

07:56.644 --> 07:59.522
Well, I'll have the rigatoni.

07:59.684 --> 08:03.154
Oh, very good choice.
Very good.

08:04.244 --> 08:07.156
So you got the test. You're cheating.

08:07.884 --> 08:09.556
I know.

08:09.844 --> 08:12.119
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:14.684 --> 08:16.402
Oh, boy.

08:18.444 --> 08:20.162
Jerry, let me ask you something.

08:20.324 --> 08:22.042
- Hi, Elaine.
- Hey.

08:22.284 --> 08:26.072
This guy leaves this jacket
at my mother's house two years ago.

08:26.484 --> 08:30.636
She hasn't spoken to him since and
now he says he wants the jacket back.

08:31.004 --> 08:33.677
- So?
- Well, I'm not giving it back.

08:34.284 --> 08:35.318
Why not?

08:35.484 --> 08:39.113
Because I meet a lot of women in
this jacket. They're attracted to it.

08:39.284 --> 08:41.592
Why do you think my mother
went out with him?

08:44.604 --> 08:46.242
- You all right?
- Yeah. Okay.

08:46.404 --> 08:48.235
What?

08:53.524 --> 08:55.560
Anyway, it's been two years.

08:55.924 --> 08:58.563
I mean, isn't there, like, a statue
of limitations on that?

08:58.884 --> 09:00.317
Statute.

09:00.884 --> 09:03.398
- What?
- Statute of limitations.

09:03.564 --> 09:05.441
It's not a statue.

09:06.244 --> 09:07.438
No, it's statue.

09:08.124 --> 09:10.718
Fine. It's a sculpture of limitations.

09:11.484 --> 09:14.760
Wait a minute. Just wait a minute.
Elaine. Elaine.

09:15.124 --> 09:18.958
Now, you're smart. Is it "statue"
or "statute" of limitations?

09:19.124 --> 09:22.753
- Statute.
- Oh, I really think you're wrong.

09:24.444 --> 09:27.038
Kramer, I have to take this test.
I don't have a lot of time.

09:27.884 --> 09:29.602
What test?

09:30.404 --> 09:33.840
- An IQ test.
- Why are you taking an IQ test?

09:34.004 --> 09:36.154
- It's for George.
- George?

09:36.884 --> 09:38.954
Look, can I explain it to you later?

09:39.124 --> 09:41.115
But why are you taking
an IQ test for George?

09:41.284 --> 09:42.558
Would you please?!

09:42.764 --> 09:45.562
- Is it for a job or something?
- Later!

09:48.484 --> 09:51.601
- You're positive it's statute?
- Yes! Yes!

09:52.124 --> 09:54.558
Welcome, welcome.
A steaming hot face cloth...

10:05.964 --> 10:08.797
- George?
- Yeah?

10:09.364 --> 10:11.195
The door's locked.

10:11.364 --> 10:12.956
Oh, it's locked?

10:13.444 --> 10:15.480
I need to get something.

10:15.844 --> 10:18.995
Monica, I'm really focused here.
This stuff's a killer.

10:19.364 --> 10:21.924
- George!
- Wish I could.

10:31.484 --> 10:32.883
Babu!

10:33.124 --> 10:35.592
If you don't mind...
Okay.

10:35.764 --> 10:39.473
- I'll get this.
- Oh, my God! It's all over the test!

10:39.644 --> 10:43.193
- I'm terribly sorry.
- Oh, man!

10:43.364 --> 10:45.878
- I'm out of time, anyway.
- Please forgive me. Please.

10:46.044 --> 10:47.841
Go ahead. I'll take care of it.

10:48.724 --> 10:50.715
Please, I'm very sorry.

10:51.364 --> 10:53.161
Tell your friends.

11:02.404 --> 11:04.872
It's all right.
She was cheating anyway.

11:06.124 --> 11:08.160
You're a very kind man.

11:08.764 --> 11:10.083
Babu...

11:10.804 --> 11:14.558
- You're Pakistani, right?
- Yes, Pakistani. Yes.

11:15.244 --> 11:17.712
Babu, may I say something?

11:17.884 --> 11:20.159
Of course. You're very smart man.
I listen.

11:20.324 --> 11:24.476
I am not a restaurateur by any means,
but it occurred to me that perhaps...

11:24.644 --> 11:27.477
...you might serve some dishes
from your native Pakistan...

11:27.644 --> 11:30.556
...as opposed to, say,
the franks and beans, for example.

11:31.204 --> 11:33.672
- There are no Pakistani people here.
- It doesn't matter.

11:33.844 --> 11:36.961
You would have the only authentic
Pakistani restaurant...

11:37.124 --> 11:38.557
...in the whole neighbourhood.

11:39.284 --> 11:40.956
Yes.

11:41.404 --> 11:44.441
You see everything, don't you?

11:44.964 --> 11:48.798
Well, you know, not everything.
I do what I can.

11:50.804 --> 11:54.797
I close down today. And when I open
again, it will be a Pakistani restaurant.

11:55.284 --> 11:58.833
Thank you. Thank you so much.
You're a very special person.

11:59.004 --> 12:00.483
Very special.

12:02.684 --> 12:04.515
I am such a great guy.

12:04.764 --> 12:07.358
Who else would've gone to the
trouble to help this immigrant?

12:07.604 --> 12:11.040
I am special. My mother was right.

12:11.204 --> 12:15.641
Of course, I've never had
Pakistani food. How bad could it be?

12:19.844 --> 12:23.917
- It was an accident.
- What, did you go on a picnic?

12:24.164 --> 12:26.519
Babu Bhatt did it.

12:28.724 --> 12:30.680
Babu Bhatt?

12:31.364 --> 12:34.242
- How am I going to explain this?
- Time's up, George.

12:35.724 --> 12:37.555
Okay.

12:43.844 --> 12:45.118
- Here you go.
- How did you do?

12:45.284 --> 12:48.242
- Piece of cake.
- What happened to the test?

12:48.404 --> 12:51.043
What? Oh, I spilled some food on it.

12:52.844 --> 12:54.960
Food? What food?

12:55.364 --> 12:56.638
What are you talking about?

12:57.284 --> 12:58.512
Where did you get food?

12:58.844 --> 13:01.039
- From my pocket.
- Your pocket?

13:02.924 --> 13:05.518
I had a sandwich in my pocket.

13:06.764 --> 13:09.722
- And coffee?
- Yeah. Had some coffee, yeah.

13:10.884 --> 13:14.559
- Where did you get the coffee?
- Where did I get the coffee?

13:14.724 --> 13:17.363
Where do you think I got the coffee?
At the grocery store.

13:17.764 --> 13:19.675
- How did you get there?
- I walked.

13:20.284 --> 13:22.798
How did you get out?
I didn't see you leave.

13:22.964 --> 13:26.479
- I climbed out the window.
- You climbed out the window?

13:26.644 --> 13:29.283
- Of course.
- Why didn't you go out the door?

13:29.604 --> 13:31.242
The door?

13:32.884 --> 13:36.479
Why would I go out the door?
The window's right here.

13:39.204 --> 13:41.843
You're a fascinating man,
George Costanza.

13:45.004 --> 13:47.598
The average person sees a situation
like this...

13:48.124 --> 13:49.603
...they walk right by it.

13:50.444 --> 13:53.402
- Not me.
- You're very special.

13:55.644 --> 13:56.872
Hey, do me a favour.

13:57.044 --> 14:00.241
Some guy comes looking for me,
tell him you don't know where I am.

14:00.404 --> 14:02.395
Of course. I always do.

14:02.764 --> 14:06.234
No, no, it's that guy. He's really
been bugging me about the jacket.

14:06.404 --> 14:08.872
- Just give it back to him.
- He'll have to kill me.

14:14.324 --> 14:17.441
- Hey, Georgie!
- I'm coming up.

14:17.644 --> 14:20.078
How did you do on the IQ test?

14:20.324 --> 14:21.916
Eighty-five!

14:24.244 --> 14:29.841
- What?
- Eighty-five, Jerry! 85 IQ.

14:32.004 --> 14:33.357
Eighty-five?

14:33.524 --> 14:36.277
Well, well, well...

14:37.204 --> 14:38.523
He's coming up?

14:38.724 --> 14:40.237
Well, I'm no genius...

14:40.444 --> 14:45.074
...but according to my calculations,
he should be here in a few seconds.

14:46.164 --> 14:48.632
Yeah, but an 85?
Jerry, that's ridiculous.

14:48.804 --> 14:51.034
Well, maybe the test
was gender-biased.

14:51.204 --> 14:54.037
You know, a lot of questions
on hunting and testicles.

15:00.324 --> 15:02.997
Oh, hello, professor.

15:06.244 --> 15:08.712
- George, I cannot believe...
- Please.

15:08.924 --> 15:13.122
- No, there's gotta be a mistake.
- You should have seen her face.

15:13.444 --> 15:15.082
It was the same look
my father gave me...

15:15.244 --> 15:17.963
...when I told him I wanted
to be a ventriloquist.

15:20.964 --> 15:22.477
But an 85?

15:22.724 --> 15:24.760
Listen, there were too many
distractions there.

15:24.924 --> 15:29.918
Babu whatever his name was.
And Kramer. I couldn't concentrate.

15:30.084 --> 15:32.678
It was a madhouse.

15:33.244 --> 15:35.041
Jerry, it was.

15:35.204 --> 15:37.593
- Let me take it again.
- Forget it.

15:37.764 --> 15:40.722
Oh, come on. Come on.
I'll guarantee you 140.

15:40.884 --> 15:42.875
- What do you have to lose?
- You could do worse!

15:43.044 --> 15:46.002
No. No, come on. I guarantee it.

15:46.724 --> 15:50.399
- All right, I'll ask her.
- Okay. Now, where am I gonna take it?

15:50.564 --> 15:54.398
Take it here. I'll leave.
There will be no distractions.

16:01.284 --> 16:04.560
Well, congratulations, my friend.

16:04.764 --> 16:07.995
Sorry I missed the grand reopening.
I was out of town for about a week.

16:08.324 --> 16:10.394
You see how I listen?

16:10.684 --> 16:13.403
I work very hard, borrow more money.

16:13.844 --> 16:17.598
I think it's fantastic. It has
a certain indefinable charm.

16:19.564 --> 16:22.681
- You wish to eat?
- Let me tell you something, Babu.

16:22.844 --> 16:26.234
You go back in that kitchen,
tell your chef I want the works.

16:26.564 --> 16:28.282
Very good.

16:31.484 --> 16:32.883
Very good?

16:33.044 --> 16:34.557
No, not very good...

16:34.724 --> 16:36.157
...very great.

16:36.324 --> 16:39.396
I am very, very great.

16:50.604 --> 16:53.562
The IQ tests always have that
sample question at the beginning...

16:53.724 --> 16:56.079
...where they show you how
to fill in the circle.

16:57.084 --> 16:59.439
This should be the first
elimination point right there.

16:59.604 --> 17:01.083
Anybody goes outside that circle:

17:01.244 --> 17:04.441
"You wanna come with us, please?
Yeah, you're done. Your test is over.

17:04.604 --> 17:07.164
You went outside the circle, okay?"

17:19.084 --> 17:22.359
- What are you doing?
- Quiet. Don't say anything.

17:22.523 --> 17:26.199
- What's going on?
- Hey, Kramer! I saw you go in there!

17:26.364 --> 17:28.958
I'm not leaving till you
give me that jacket!

17:29.364 --> 17:32.003
- Open up, Kramer!
- What did you come in here for?

17:32.164 --> 17:35.042
Well, I thought I'd throw him off.
See, he knows where I live.

17:35.844 --> 17:38.881
Look, Kramer, I have to return
this test. I've gotta get out of here.

17:39.324 --> 17:42.157
- I thought you took the test.
- I had to take it again.

17:42.324 --> 17:44.633
- How come?
- What's the difference?!

17:44.964 --> 17:46.682
- Well, you can't leave now.
- What?

17:46.844 --> 17:49.233
Come on, Kramer,
I want that jacket back!

17:49.884 --> 17:51.761
Never!

17:54.724 --> 17:56.874
Come on, George, open up.

18:04.764 --> 18:07.562
- Well?
- How you doing?

18:09.284 --> 18:10.922
Where's the test?

18:11.204 --> 18:13.593
You know, it's the damnedest thing.

18:13.764 --> 18:16.722
I went out the window again
to get a cup of coffee...

18:23.284 --> 18:24.797
Babu...

18:25.924 --> 18:27.437
Babu.

18:31.484 --> 18:32.917
Babu...

18:33.164 --> 18:38.477
...you know, I've gotta tell you,
I never do this, but the shrimp...

18:38.964 --> 18:40.443
...it's just a little stringy.

18:41.804 --> 18:44.398
- You have any chicken?
- The shrimp is stringy?

18:44.564 --> 18:46.839
- Well, maybe you refrigerated...
- Quiet!

18:47.924 --> 18:49.676
- No, l...
- You shut up!

18:49.844 --> 18:52.995
You make me change restaurant,
but nobody come!

18:53.164 --> 18:57.043
You say make Pakistani. Babu Bhatt
have only Pakistani restaurant.

18:57.524 --> 19:01.233
But where are people? You see
people? Show me people!

19:01.404 --> 19:02.962
There are no people!

19:03.964 --> 19:06.239
- I think I'll just take the check.
- You bad man!

19:06.404 --> 19:08.634
You very, very bad man.

19:10.324 --> 19:14.078
Bad man? Could my mother
have been wrong?

19:23.764 --> 19:25.675
Are you looking for George?

19:25.924 --> 19:27.676
Well...

19:28.004 --> 19:29.722
Kind of.

19:30.524 --> 19:32.162
George left.

19:33.924 --> 19:36.199
Is that the test?

19:37.844 --> 19:39.641
This?

19:40.604 --> 19:42.276
Yeah.

19:43.204 --> 19:45.195
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

19:47.044 --> 19:49.604
I hope you do a lot better this time.

19:52.884 --> 19:54.237
Actually, I think I did.

19:54.404 --> 19:59.194
The first time,
I couldn't really concentrate.

20:06.404 --> 20:08.918
You know what it was?
Bad location.

20:09.084 --> 20:12.315
Come on, let's not stand here
too long. We might run into her.

20:12.524 --> 20:14.833
Aren't you cold?
Where's your jacket?

20:15.404 --> 20:19.033
- Oh, sorry.
- I'm going upstairs.

20:20.524 --> 20:24.836
Hey, guys. I just ran into Monica.
You know what my IQ is?

20:25.284 --> 20:28.003
One fifty-one.

20:28.164 --> 20:30.394
- One fifty-one?
- Yeah.

20:32.164 --> 20:33.677
That's a good score.

20:33.964 --> 20:35.875
So, what are you up for?
How about Mexican?

20:36.044 --> 20:38.319
- Italian.
- No, Chinese.

20:38.724 --> 20:40.601
You know what would be great?

20:53.444 --> 20:56.959
It's tough to do a good deed. Let's look
at your professional good-deed doers:

20:57.124 --> 20:59.194
Your Lone Rangers, your Supermen...

20:59.444 --> 21:02.436
...your Batmen, your Spider-Men,
your Elastic Men.

21:03.084 --> 21:06.554
They're all wearing disguises. Masks
over their faces, secret identities.

21:06.724 --> 21:11.161
Don't want people to know
who they are. Too much aggravation.

21:11.884 --> 21:13.556
"Superman,
thanks for saving my life...

21:13.724 --> 21:16.363
...but did you have
to come through my wall?

21:16.764 --> 21:21.679
I'm renting here. They got a security
deposit. What am I supposed to do?"

21:30.084 --> 21:32.075
