00:17.517 --> 00:21.000

doing homework ahead of time.

00:21.068 --> 00:22.275
Who knew that was a thing?

00:22.344 --> 00:24.448
- Most people.

00:24.517 --> 00:27.172
- Proud of you, girl.

00:27.241 --> 00:29.413
- Has anyone seen my tool belt?

00:29.482 --> 00:31.586
There's a light bulb
burnt out in the kitchen.

00:31.655 --> 00:33.206
- Well, I tried.

00:33.275 --> 00:35.448
Farewell, homework.

00:35.517 --> 00:37.862
- Wait, what happened?
- It's my dad.

00:37.931 --> 00:40.827
Once a year, for a brief
but intense period,

00:40.896 --> 00:42.137
he starts to fix things.

00:42.206 --> 00:43.586
It never goes well,

00:43.655 --> 00:45.689
which is why
I hid his tool belt

00:45.758 --> 00:47.827
in a place
he will never find it.

00:47.896 --> 00:50.655
- [grunts]
Found it!

00:50.724 --> 00:54.103
It was wedged behind the washer
for some reason.

00:54.172 --> 00:56.137
- So strange.

00:56.206 --> 00:57.655
We got to go.

00:57.724 --> 01:00.103
You guys want to hang out
in a parking lot or something?

01:00.172 --> 01:02.586
- Sounds like you're
making excuses not to study.

01:02.655 --> 01:04.517
- Yeah, your dad is just
changing a light bulb.

01:04.586 --> 01:08.310
[power tools whirring]

01:08.379 --> 01:10.827
Okay, we got to find
somewhere else to study.

01:10.896 --> 01:12.344
- How about your house?

01:12.413 --> 01:13.724
- Oh, no.
That's not gonna work.

01:13.793 --> 01:15.758
My aunt and uncle are over
with my ten cousins.

01:15.827 --> 01:17.586
Combined with my eight brothers
and sisters,

01:17.655 --> 01:20.862
it is more kids than I can
count, and I am good at math.

01:20.931 --> 01:22.448
- What about your house?

01:22.517 --> 01:25.793
- There's a...
chipmunk infestation.

01:25.862 --> 01:27.896
- I thought there was
a chipmunk infestation

01:27.965 --> 01:29.482
last month.

01:29.551 --> 01:33.241
- [nervously] Yep.
It's a serious problem.

01:33.310 --> 01:35.103
- Hey, you're always
making excuses

01:35.172 --> 01:36.655
of why we can't go
to your house.

01:36.724 --> 01:39.551
- What?
That is so not true.

01:39.620 --> 01:42.586
We can't go to my house.
There's a...radiation leak.

01:52.206 --> 01:54.758
- Yeah, you make excuses
every time.

01:54.827 --> 01:56.379
- And now that
I think about it,

01:56.448 --> 01:58.551
I don't think I've
ever been in your room.

01:58.620 --> 02:00.586
- Me neither.
Let's go right now.

02:00.655 --> 02:02.551
- But what about studying?

02:02.620 --> 02:04.827
- We all knew that wasn't
gonna happen. Come on.

02:16.482 --> 02:19.034
Not so fast, Mr. Wizard.

02:19.103 --> 02:21.758
- Hey, Dad.
See you found your tool belt.

02:21.827 --> 02:24.103
- Yep. I woke up this morning
feeling handy,

02:24.172 --> 02:25.896
so I'm fixing that light bulb.

02:25.965 --> 02:29.275
- So why are you
hammering boards together?

02:29.344 --> 02:33.344
- I forgot how little you know
about home improvement.

02:33.413 --> 02:35.103
You can't reach a light bulb
without a ladder,

02:35.172 --> 02:36.241
so I'm building one.

02:36.310 --> 02:37.965
- Can't you just buy a ladder?

02:40.586 --> 02:43.689
- Buy a man a ladder, and
he'll reach things for a day.

02:43.758 --> 02:45.413
Teach him to build a ladder,

02:45.482 --> 02:48.413
and he'll reach the sky.

02:48.482 --> 02:51.379
- You know what,
my fault for asking.

02:51.448 --> 02:54.448
- Ooh, I got you something.

02:54.517 --> 02:57.862
It's time Mr. Fix-It
had a Fix-It Jr.

02:57.931 --> 02:58.965
Put it on.

03:04.965 --> 03:08.482
- For some reason,
I feel powerful.

03:08.551 --> 03:10.586
- That's the belt talking, son.

03:10.655 --> 03:12.931
Now, grab a tool
and help me with this ladder.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.344
- Which tool?
- Doesn't matter.

03:21.379 --> 03:22.517
- This is my room.

03:22.586 --> 03:24.275
Four walls, ceiling.
Pretty typical.

03:24.344 --> 03:25.827
So you guys want
to hit that parking lot?

03:33.275 --> 03:37.413
- This is not what I expected
your room to look like.

03:37.482 --> 03:38.724
- Hi, girls.

03:38.793 --> 03:39.965
I don't think
I've ever seen you

03:40.034 --> 03:42.068
in Munchy and Jaget's room
before.

03:42.137 --> 03:44.689
- Munchy and Jaget's room?

03:44.758 --> 03:46.965
- That's right.
And while you're here,

03:47.034 --> 03:48.827
don't destroy anything
with fireworks.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.034
[both laugh]

03:50.103 --> 03:52.931
I'm serious.
Don't destroy anything.

03:55.482 --> 03:57.413
- Wait, you share a room with--

03:57.482 --> 03:59.827
- Who dares
disturb my slumber?!

04:02.379 --> 04:04.517
- I share a room with Jaget.

04:04.586 --> 04:06.482
- It's not a room.

04:08.620 --> 04:12.103
It's the Jagatorium.

04:12.172 --> 04:15.275
- He calls our room
the Jagatorium.

04:15.344 --> 04:18.482
- If you share a room, then why
are all of the decorations his?

04:18.551 --> 04:19.758
- Not all of them.

04:21.724 --> 04:24.137
This is my area.
Come on in.

04:28.862 --> 04:30.586
Let me give you a quick tour.

04:30.655 --> 04:32.172
This is some of my stuff.

04:32.241 --> 04:33.655
That's where I sleep.

04:33.724 --> 04:37.034
And that concludes the tour.

04:37.103 --> 04:40.517
- It's nice.
It just feels a little cramped.

04:40.586 --> 04:41.827
- Too much talking.

04:41.896 --> 04:44.137
If I can't take my power nap,
I'm leaving.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.896
- Did he just walk
into the closet?

04:48.965 --> 04:50.724
- No, that's
Jaget's other room.

04:50.793 --> 04:52.724
- What?
- Other room?!

04:56.689 --> 04:58.310
- What is this?

04:58.379 --> 05:00.931
- This is Jaget's dojo.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.586
- You are not permitted
to be in here,

05:03.655 --> 05:05.758
but since you are,
let me show you around.

05:07.517 --> 05:10.724
Here are my Jag-Jitsu weapons.

05:12.206 --> 05:14.655
My Zen garden.

05:14.724 --> 05:18.068
And my best friend,

05:18.137 --> 05:20.896
Clint Kickwood.

05:20.965 --> 05:23.172
- How is a piece of cardboard
your best friend?

05:23.241 --> 05:26.103
- Yeah, and follow-up question,
who is Clint Kickwood?

05:26.172 --> 05:29.068
- [gasps]

05:32.862 --> 05:36.137
Clint Kickwood is a martial
arts action movie star.

05:36.206 --> 05:39.034
He started out as
a crossing guard, just like me.

05:39.103 --> 05:40.689
- It looks like someone
stepped on it.

05:40.758 --> 05:42.517
- No, that's his footprint.

05:42.586 --> 05:45.482
He signs things
by kicking them.

05:45.551 --> 05:47.965
That's what
makes this so special.

05:48.034 --> 05:50.034
- Wait, why can't this
be your bedroom

05:50.103 --> 05:51.827
and Munchy can take
the other room?

05:51.896 --> 05:53.793
- You know, that makes
a lot of sense.

05:53.862 --> 05:58.000
- It can't be my bedroom,
because it's my dojo.

05:58.068 --> 06:01.724
And one thing
can't be two things.

06:01.793 --> 06:04.000
- No, we are not leaving
until we talk more

06:04.068 --> 06:06.034
about Munchy
getting his own room.

06:06.103 --> 06:08.655
- What's that, Clint Kickwood?

06:08.724 --> 06:12.448
I should grab my sparring sword
and chase them around the room?

06:12.517 --> 06:14.758

three square feet of space

of space.

with more space?

More space.

You guys helped me realize
that I was right

fight a colony of wasps over,

my own room dozens of times.

- That's it.
What if I act like Jaget?

07:32.655 --> 07:34.689
- Would that work?
- Yes.

07:34.758 --> 07:37.275
See, Jaget sees himself
as a sensei.

There can't be two senseis.

So if I come in

The light bulb is the heart.

10:38.241 --> 10:40.482
- I knew we were
forgetting something.

10:40.551 --> 10:41.965
Let's shut it off.

10:42.034 --> 10:46.068
The valve is either
in the basement, shed, or roof.

10:46.137 --> 10:48.137
- I'll bring a hammer,
just in case.

[both laugh]

10:49.655 --> 10:51.482
- He's new.

10:51.551 --> 10:53.103
Grab the big one.

10:55.379 --> 10:56.896
That's my boy.

11:07.482 --> 11:10.517
- [grunts]

11:10.586 --> 11:14.034
- Munchy, Jaget is not here.
You can stop trying to be him.

11:14.103 --> 11:15.724
- Don't tell me when to stop.

11:15.793 --> 11:17.724
Only I say when to stop.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.103
Whoa. I am so sorry.

11:22.172 --> 11:24.620
I think I went too deep.
I'm back.

11:24.689 --> 11:27.206
- Well, trying to be
a second Jaget didn't work.

11:27.275 --> 11:28.931
Maybe we should go back
to using mirrors

11:29.000 --> 11:30.137
to make your square bigger.

11:30.206 --> 11:31.793
- I don't want to go back
to the square,

11:31.862 --> 11:33.482
or an illusion
of a bigger square!

11:33.551 --> 11:34.862
I want my own room.

11:34.931 --> 11:37.344
- We have to find a way
to convince Jaget.

11:37.413 --> 11:40.586
- How? He won't listen
to reason.

11:40.655 --> 11:42.482
- We need to get some leverage.

11:42.551 --> 11:44.137
Follow me.
- Wait. Wait.

11:44.206 --> 11:46.482
Isn't Jaget in there?
- Trust me.

11:52.586 --> 11:54.965
Don't worry. Jaget's in
a deep, meditative trance.

11:55.034 --> 11:58.000
He can't see or hear us.

11:58.068 --> 12:00.655
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, he does this every day.

12:00.724 --> 12:02.000
He visualizes himself and Clint

12:02.068 --> 12:04.965
walking on
an endless crosswalk.

12:05.034 --> 12:06.448
- What's the plan?

12:06.517 --> 12:08.862
- We take Clint Kickwood
and hold it for ransom

12:08.931 --> 12:10.275
until he gives me my own room.

12:17.517 --> 12:20.448
- [grunts]

12:20.517 --> 12:22.137
- No, no, no!
He knows the cutout is gone.

12:22.206 --> 12:24.448
Do something
before he wakes up!

12:24.517 --> 12:27.000
- Got it.

12:27.068 --> 12:29.827
- [sighs contentedly]

12:29.896 --> 12:31.034
- Problem solved.

12:31.103 --> 12:33.275

New problem created.

like that.

12:50.310 --> 12:52.655

come back for you...

13:08.275 --> 13:09.896
- Yeah, but luckily
they take breaks

13:09.965 --> 13:13.413

Popsicle break.

13:16.862 --> 13:18.275
- Okay.
We need to hurry.

13:18.344 --> 13:20.137
Jaget's gonna
stop meditating soon.

13:20.206 --> 13:21.827
- How's the ransom note
coming, Lex?

13:21.896 --> 13:23.620
- Oh, it is going so well.

13:23.689 --> 13:27.413
I used glitter, pipe cleaners,
and googly eyes.

13:28.896 --> 13:31.068
- How about the message?

13:31.137 --> 13:32.275
- Not much room left,

13:32.344 --> 13:34.965
but I will try
to squeeze it in.

13:35.034 --> 13:36.275
- Hey, have you guys
seen my--

13:36.344 --> 13:38.448
[gasps]

13:38.517 --> 13:41.137
Clint Kickwood!
What's going on here?

13:41.206 --> 13:42.310
- Hey, stop right there!

13:42.379 --> 13:44.551
- This is
an industrial shredder.

13:44.620 --> 13:45.793
If you take another step,

13:45.862 --> 13:47.620
this is what happens
to Clint Kickwood.

13:54.620 --> 13:58.206
Ooh, she's hungry.

13:58.275 --> 14:00.448
- What do you want?
- I want my own bedroom.

14:00.517 --> 14:01.965
I didn't want to have
to do it this way,

14:02.034 --> 14:03.344
but I don't know
what else to do.

14:03.413 --> 14:04.586
- Where's this
coming from, bro?

14:04.655 --> 14:07.379
You were just doing MMMA
and acting cool.

14:07.448 --> 14:10.310
- There is no MMMA.
It was all a lie.

14:10.379 --> 14:12.000
- [gasps]

14:12.068 --> 14:14.931
You monster.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.551
If you want your own room
that badly,

14:16.620 --> 14:18.172
we can work something out,
but first,

14:18.241 --> 14:21.448
free Clint Kickwood.

14:21.517 --> 14:23.896
- All right.
I'll let him down.

14:23.965 --> 14:25.896
No!
[shreds]

[all scream]

14:43.758 --> 14:45.793
My bad.

14:45.862 --> 14:48.034
- Not only are you
not getting your own room,

14:48.103 --> 14:49.448
you're not getting any room.

14:49.517 --> 14:52.206
You're banned from
the Jagatorium and my dojo.

14:52.275 --> 14:54.379
We are no longer roommates.

14:58.241 --> 15:00.793
- I didn't even get
to give him my ransom note.

15:00.862 --> 15:02.620
What am I gonna do with this?

15:14.103 --> 15:17.310
- I feel so well rested.
- Me too.

15:17.379 --> 15:20.586
I had the best sleep
of my life last night.

15:20.655 --> 15:23.379
- I had the worst sleep
of my life last night.

15:25.724 --> 15:28.620
Jaget is still not letting me
into either of his rooms.

15:28.689 --> 15:32.620
I had to sleep in the kitchen
with this lettuce for a pillow.

15:32.689 --> 15:35.000
Jaget says that's my room now
until I move out.

15:35.068 --> 15:36.620
- That is crazy.

15:36.689 --> 15:38.827
- It's okay.
I graduate in a few years.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.137
I did the math,

15:40.206 --> 15:44.206
and I only have to sleep
like this 942 more times.

15:44.275 --> 15:46.965
- We have to fix this.
- How?

15:47.034 --> 15:49.275
Ever since we destroyed
his autographed Clint Kickwood

15:49.344 --> 15:51.448
cut out, he won't even
talk to me.

15:51.517 --> 15:53.344
- Hmm...

15:53.413 --> 15:55.275
Well, if he won't
talk to Munchy,

15:55.344 --> 15:58.000
we'll just have to get
the one person he will talk to.

15:58.068 --> 15:59.724
- [snoring loudly]
- Munchy?

15:59.793 --> 16:01.034
Munchy?

16:03.206 --> 16:05.758
- Aw, he looks so peaceful.

16:05.827 --> 16:08.103
- But we have to get him up
and get to work.

16:08.172 --> 16:10.103
Luckily, another popsicle break
is gonna be over

16:10.172 --> 16:12.551
in three, two, one.

16:12.620 --> 16:14.482
[power tools whirring]
- [screams]

16:25.137 --> 16:26.896
- Don't worry, Clint Kickwood.

16:26.965 --> 16:28.551
I'm gonna make you whole again.

16:32.862 --> 16:34.896
[knocks on door]

16:34.965 --> 16:37.034
- Go away!
Unless you're Munchy.

16:37.103 --> 16:41.103
Then I didn't say anything,
cause I'm not talking to you.

16:41.172 --> 16:43.000
- Kick one!

16:43.068 --> 16:45.448
Awww!

16:51.034 --> 16:52.620
- It you can't be!
You're--

16:52.689 --> 16:53.862
- Clint Kickwood!

16:53.931 --> 16:57.689
Hiyah!

16:57.758 --> 16:59.137
- What are you doing here?

16:59.206 --> 17:01.620
- I was hired
by a very sorry young man

17:01.689 --> 17:03.000
to come talk to you.

17:03.068 --> 17:05.413
- I'm the very sorry young man.

17:05.482 --> 17:07.137
- No, absolutely not.

17:07.206 --> 17:09.793
- Now you hold it
right there, sunshine!

17:09.862 --> 17:12.379
I was hired to help you two
solve your problems.

17:12.448 --> 17:14.586
And I'm gonna do it.
That's right.

17:14.655 --> 17:16.896
Clint Kickwood doesn't
just kick stuff.

17:16.965 --> 17:18.655
I fix stuff!

17:20.206 --> 17:23.206
- Sorry, Mr. Kickwood.
I'm just too mad at my brother.

17:23.275 --> 17:24.758
- I get it.

17:24.827 --> 17:27.862
It reminds me of when
I did the movie "Double Kick."

17:27.931 --> 17:30.965
I had to fight my most
powerful enemy yet,

17:31.034 --> 17:33.103
myself.

17:33.172 --> 17:35.310
- It was amazing!

17:35.379 --> 17:37.103
You played twin brothers!

17:37.172 --> 17:39.172
It was your best
performance ever,

17:39.241 --> 17:41.862
and second best.

17:41.931 --> 17:43.275
- Thank you.

17:43.344 --> 17:46.482
But the real fight
wasn't solved by using these.

17:46.551 --> 17:49.620
It was solved by using these.

17:49.689 --> 17:51.827
Now let's kick around
some truths.

17:51.896 --> 17:53.551
You, go first!

17:53.620 --> 17:57.827
- I messed up and destroyed
something my brother loved,

17:57.896 --> 18:00.172
but I did it
because I want my own room.

18:00.241 --> 18:01.793
- Nice sharing.

18:01.862 --> 18:04.275
Your turn!

18:04.344 --> 18:06.379
- I looked after Munchy
his whole life.

18:06.448 --> 18:08.241
We only started sharing a room
in the first place

18:08.310 --> 18:09.379
because of him.

18:09.448 --> 18:11.758
- What does that mean--
- Whoa!

18:11.827 --> 18:14.724
Did you play a therapist by day
and assassin by night

18:14.793 --> 18:18.137
in "The Doctor is
in Your Face"?!

18:18.206 --> 18:21.896
No, I'll ask the questions.

18:21.965 --> 18:24.758
What does that mean?

18:24.827 --> 18:27.241
- You remember when we first
moved here from Norway?

18:27.310 --> 18:29.344
- Not really.
I was pretty young.

18:29.413 --> 18:33.379
- Well, you got your own room,
but everything was new

18:33.448 --> 18:35.655
and you were so scared
you kept having nightmares.

18:35.724 --> 18:38.862
So I started sleeping
in your room, and it worked.

18:38.931 --> 18:41.034
You weren't scared anymore.

18:41.103 --> 18:43.931
- I don't remember this at all.
- Well, it happened.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.862
You made me promise
to never leave you alone.

18:46.931 --> 18:49.689
And I never break promises.

18:49.758 --> 18:53.448
- Bro...
- It's like a kick in my heart.

18:53.517 --> 18:55.827

Keep going. Keep going.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.689

18:59.758 --> 19:01.896
You're not a little kid
anymore.

19:01.965 --> 19:05.551

always need my big brother.

19:07.551 --> 19:11.241

Now I really need
to go call my brother.
