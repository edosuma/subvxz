10:32.034 --> 10:34.137

Adolescent Horniness.

10:34.241 --> 10:36.448
- So, they claim that the size
of the Skankzs' breasts

10:36.551 --> 10:38.827
are arousing children
of all ages.

10:38.931 --> 10:40.724
- Bottom line, kids are
horned out of their mind.

10:40.827 --> 10:43.000
- JOHN: Yes.
- So, we've been going back and

10:43.103 --> 10:44.793
forth with the toy division
about possible solutions.

10:44.896 --> 10:48.241
At first, we suggested adding
areolae to make the toys

10:48.344 --> 10:49.827
more anatomically correct.

10:49.931 --> 10:52.103
But this just made children
hornier.

10:52.206 --> 10:53.103
- Horny as hell.

10:53.206 --> 10:54.724
The children
were borderline rabid.

10:54.827 --> 10:58.517
So, we told the team to remove
the areolae, but instead,

10:58.620 --> 11:01.655
they have somehow
tripled in size,

11:01.758 --> 11:03.413
which was never the goal.
