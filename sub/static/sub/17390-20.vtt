WEBVTT

00:04.171 --> 00:06.238
How'd it go at the bank?
Not good.

00:06.273 --> 00:09.441
This mini-mall job prep
is costing us a fortune.

00:09.476 --> 00:11.510
The rental on the crane,
the lumber.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.078
Our account balance is so low,

00:13.113 --> 00:15.514
they wouldn't even
give me a lollipop.

00:15.549 --> 00:17.783
But it's the biggest
job we've ever done.

00:17.818 --> 00:19.317
We should be rolling
in the dough.

00:19.352 --> 00:21.787
I was gonna start hanging
out with Jimmy Buffett.

00:21.822 --> 00:24.089
We don't get paid
until we start the job,

00:24.124 --> 00:26.091
and the permits are taking
longer than they're supposed to.

00:26.126 --> 00:29.327
We just... we can't cover
all these bills.

00:29.362 --> 00:32.197
Well, then charge it
to a credit card,

00:32.232 --> 00:34.800
and then charge that
to another credit card.

00:34.835 --> 00:37.102
Nobody pays for anything
in this country.

00:37.137 --> 00:39.238
That's how we all have
so much stuff.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.409
I don't think you're getting
enough oxygen up there.

00:45.145 --> 00:46.445
Okay, look, we're gonna
have to put our own

00:46.480 --> 00:47.612
personal money in
and float the company

00:47.647 --> 00:49.214
until we get paid.

00:49.249 --> 00:51.116
All right, okay,
I'll kick in my share.

00:51.151 --> 00:53.385
If I want to have a real
relationship with Jimmy Buffett,

00:53.420 --> 00:55.421
he's got to like me for me.

01:02.496 --> 01:04.363
What's happening?
Are you cleaning?

01:05.265 --> 01:07.099
The pantry?
(gasps)

01:07.134 --> 01:10.069
I have dreamed of this day
for so many years.

01:10.837 --> 01:12.337
No, no, no, no,

01:12.372 --> 01:14.106
we need to do a little
family belt-tightening

01:14.141 --> 01:15.574
until this mini-mall job starts.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.409
Look at all this food
we never eat.

01:17.444 --> 01:19.544
Why do we have
five bags of rice?

01:19.579 --> 01:21.379
Because you didn't see
the other five bags

01:21.414 --> 01:22.581
that are still in there.

01:24.384 --> 01:25.550
Look, don't get stressed,
all right?

01:25.585 --> 01:27.152
We'll just loan money
to the company,

01:27.187 --> 01:28.353
we've done it before.

01:28.388 --> 01:29.855
Just let me know
before you do it.

01:29.890 --> 01:32.157
Don't worry, I will.
I did it this morning.

01:34.628 --> 01:37.262
Okay, well, as long as
it wasn't all of it.

01:37.297 --> 01:38.830
No, no, of course not.
(chuckles)

01:38.865 --> 01:40.199
It was all of it.

01:41.902 --> 01:44.136
But I have to put down
the kids' deposits

01:44.171 --> 01:46.171
for summer camp
or we'll lose our spot.

01:46.206 --> 01:47.472
What? They don't need camp.

01:47.507 --> 01:49.341
Let them stare at a wall
and be bored all summer

01:49.376 --> 01:50.475
like we were.

01:50.510 --> 01:51.843
Huh?

01:51.878 --> 01:54.346
Made us strong and angry.

01:54.381 --> 01:56.581
Camp's not for them;
it's for us.

01:56.616 --> 01:57.616
What?
Yeah.

01:57.651 --> 01:59.151
Remember that week last summer

01:59.186 --> 02:00.318
when Kate and Teddy were at camp

02:00.353 --> 02:01.520
and Emme was at my parents?

02:02.556 --> 02:05.524
(gasps)
No pants week.

02:05.559 --> 02:07.592
Can't tell me you're
not gonna miss that.

02:07.627 --> 02:09.394
Okay, all right,
new strategy:

02:09.429 --> 02:11.329
we're gonna prioritize camp
over everything else

02:11.364 --> 02:12.531
around here,
starting with the food.

02:12.566 --> 02:13.865
No new food

02:13.900 --> 02:17.169
until we eat everything
in the house.

02:17.204 --> 02:18.503
Daddy, can I have a snack?

02:18.538 --> 02:20.238
Uh, you bet, yeah.

02:20.273 --> 02:22.641
Uh, here, how about a half
gallon of fruit cocktail?

02:23.910 --> 02:24.910
Yay!

02:27.914 --> 02:29.548
Why do we try so hard
at Christmas?
I...

02:32.619 --> 02:34.219
So, your brother's
birthday is coming up,

02:34.254 --> 02:36.421
and I'm gonna have
his party at our place.

02:36.456 --> 02:39.357
Oh, uh, I think Marcy's
planning on hosting it.

02:39.392 --> 02:41.193
Interesting.

02:41.228 --> 02:44.529
I had no idea his wife was
plotting behind my back.

02:44.564 --> 02:46.631
Oh, no, no, no, no,
I didn't mean...

02:46.666 --> 02:49.267
Thank you for
being on my team.

02:49.302 --> 02:50.902
I'm not on anybody's team.

02:50.937 --> 02:52.938
I don't, I don't even know
what game we're playing.

02:54.274 --> 02:56.841
All right, Mom, Dad.

02:56.876 --> 02:58.443
Dig in, huh?

02:58.478 --> 03:01.913
Hot dogs and rice--
where's the bun?

03:01.948 --> 03:03.782
Well, just roll it
around in the rice.

03:03.817 --> 03:05.517
It'll make
its own bun.

03:05.552 --> 03:07.920
Looks like it's
giving me the finger.

03:09.556 --> 03:11.890
We're just doing
a little belt-tightening

03:11.925 --> 03:13.425
since Adam's
between jobs.

03:13.460 --> 03:15.327
Yeah-- what, no,
I'm not between jobs.

03:15.362 --> 03:18.330
I just finished one job
and I'm about to start another.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.265
So between jobs.

03:21.401 --> 03:23.902
In front of jobs.

03:23.937 --> 03:26.238
Boom and bust-- that's
what I warned you about

03:26.273 --> 03:27.539
when you started
that business.

03:27.574 --> 03:29.241
There's no bust.

03:29.276 --> 03:31.476
There's boom,
space, boom.

03:33.947 --> 03:37.249
And right now
we're in the space.

03:37.284 --> 03:41.319
You know, I think this meal
has a real international flair.

03:41.354 --> 03:44.423
This must be what they eat
at Chinese baseball games.

03:45.625 --> 03:46.958
I'll tell you what,

03:46.993 --> 03:48.927
you need money, I'll
loan you the money.

03:48.962 --> 03:50.262
What do you say?

03:50.297 --> 03:52.564
No, thank you.
Yes, please.

03:52.599 --> 03:54.366
Well, which is it?

03:54.401 --> 03:56.601
No, thank you.
Yes, please.

03:56.636 --> 03:59.571
Andi, uh, can I talk
to you in the...

03:59.606 --> 04:01.240
pantry, please?

04:02.909 --> 04:04.943
Absolutely.

04:04.978 --> 04:06.611
They want to
argue privately.

04:06.646 --> 04:09.548
Yeah, he doesn't want
us to hear her win.
Mm.

04:11.351 --> 04:12.951
What are you doing out there?
Well...

04:12.986 --> 04:15.920
Look, I know your relationship
with your Dad is complex,

04:15.955 --> 04:17.322
but that's not gonna change.

04:17.357 --> 04:18.556
But if we take
this loan,

04:18.591 --> 04:19.991
what can change

04:20.026 --> 04:21.960
is that we'll have
hot dog buns, huh?

04:21.995 --> 04:23.295
And the kids
can go to camp,

04:23.330 --> 04:24.929
and you won't have to wash

04:24.964 --> 04:27.432
your pants for a week
'cause you won't be wearing any.

04:29.469 --> 04:30.869
Oh! No, no, no, no.

04:30.904 --> 04:32.537
Borrowing money from family
is a bad idea.

04:32.572 --> 04:34.306
It brings out
the worst in people.

04:34.341 --> 04:35.874
Technically, you borrowed
money from me today.

04:35.909 --> 04:38.410
And it's bringing out
the worst in you.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.545
You will thank me later,
all right?

04:40.580 --> 04:42.314
This is the right move.

04:42.349 --> 04:44.916
(sighs)
Are those hot dog buns?

04:44.951 --> 04:46.885
Shh!

04:46.920 --> 04:48.520
There's only two left.

04:48.555 --> 04:50.355
I'm saving them for us.
Aw.

04:52.459 --> 04:53.558
Hey, Bev,

04:53.593 --> 04:55.661
they found
hot dog buns.

04:57.063 --> 04:59.064
Â¶

05:09.042 --> 05:10.442
Dad?

05:10.477 --> 05:11.843
Pretty fancy digs
you got here.

05:11.878 --> 05:14.546
Is this an office
or a Ramada Inn?

05:14.581 --> 05:16.014
Fancy?

05:16.049 --> 05:18.016
It's a trailer we bought
at a police auction.

05:18.051 --> 05:20.819
Someone may or may not
have died in here.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.454
So, uh, what
brings you around?

05:22.489 --> 05:24.489
Well, I wanted to get a look
at how you're running things

05:24.524 --> 05:26.925
now that I've invested
money in the company.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.027
No, no, no.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.929
You did not invest
in the company.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.564
You loaned the money
to me personally.

05:32.599 --> 05:33.832
What's the big deal?

05:33.867 --> 05:35.834
I mean, Don seemed
happy to see me.

05:35.869 --> 05:37.936
Yes, I did and yes, I am.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.971
You should listen to Dad;
he's got some great ideas.

05:40.006 --> 05:43.041
You know, he didn't need
to borrow money from me.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.043
Well, I have more expenses
than he does.

05:45.078 --> 05:46.845
He only had one kid;
you had three

05:46.880 --> 05:49.081
because you can't control
your urges.

05:50.650 --> 05:52.951
I'm controlling
my urges right now.
Mm-hmm.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.986
Ah, what's this?

05:55.021 --> 05:57.956
Oh, that's a lumber invoice
for the mini-mall project.

05:57.991 --> 06:00.125
That's a lot of wood--
have you counted it?

06:00.160 --> 06:02.527
What?
Nobody counts the wood, Dad.

06:02.562 --> 06:04.496
It'd take forever.

06:04.531 --> 06:07.399
This place'd just be called
Burns Brothers Wood Counting.

06:07.434 --> 06:08.633
I'll do it.

06:08.668 --> 06:11.569
This is why I got to
keep an eye on this place.

06:11.604 --> 06:13.972
And I'm happy to
have you, Pop.

06:14.007 --> 06:16.508
This is a nightmare,
you got to get rid of him.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.410
Why didn't you say that
while he was in here?

06:18.445 --> 06:20.512
That's not my role in the
family; it's you versus us,

06:20.547 --> 06:22.447
and right now
you've got to stop us.

06:23.116 --> 06:25.417
I don't know if either
of you are concerned,

06:25.452 --> 06:29.087
but your dad is outside
yelling at a pile of wood.

06:29.122 --> 06:32.557
According to my mother, that's
how the wood knows he cares.

06:32.592 --> 06:34.559
Uh, can you give this
receipt to Marcy?

06:34.594 --> 06:37.028
I'm doing a charity drive and
she was kind enough to donate

06:37.063 --> 06:38.596
your old laptop to the library.

06:38.631 --> 06:40.198
Did you say my old laptop?

06:40.233 --> 06:41.900
My personal, private laptop?

06:41.935 --> 06:43.535
Ruh-roh.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.103
How did she find it?

06:45.138 --> 06:46.171
I hid it in my sock drawer.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.972
That's where he used to hide
his girlie magazines

06:48.007 --> 06:49.541
when we were kids.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.142
You know, you're taller,
but you're still a pervert.

06:51.177 --> 06:53.011
Don, they'll erase the
laptop before they share it

06:53.046 --> 06:54.879
with the public.

06:54.914 --> 06:56.548
No, no, they can't do that.
I got personal stuff on there.

06:56.583 --> 06:57.615
I need it back.

06:57.650 --> 07:00.018
I'm not sure I can get it back.

07:00.053 --> 07:02.020
This is gonna be
so embarrassing.

07:02.055 --> 07:04.889
(chuckles) You know what? This
day did not start out great,

07:04.924 --> 07:06.858
but you have really
turned it around for me.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.462
(door opens)

07:10.497 --> 07:12.530
Hey.
Hey.

07:12.565 --> 07:13.598
Check it out.

07:15.034 --> 07:17.169
A full bag of hot dog buns.

07:18.505 --> 07:20.071
We're back, baby.

07:21.508 --> 07:23.575
I am feeling very
right about this loan.

07:23.610 --> 07:24.843
Oh, yeah?

07:24.878 --> 07:26.144
I had to work here
this afternoon.

07:26.179 --> 07:27.579
Dad came to the office

07:27.614 --> 07:29.147
and was sticking his nose
in everything.

07:29.182 --> 07:32.851
Look, I know you that you
want me to be outraged,

07:32.886 --> 07:34.953
but I just paid the
kids' summer camp deposits,

07:34.988 --> 07:37.155
so I'm thinking that
your short-term pain

07:37.190 --> 07:39.591
is worth our long-term gain.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.159
A-boop.

07:41.194 --> 07:42.594
JOE:
Oh.

07:42.629 --> 07:45.597
Your credit card bill
is ridiculous.

07:45.632 --> 07:48.867
Oh, great, now he's here
and he's going through our mail.

07:48.902 --> 07:52.070
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
that's a federal offense.

07:52.105 --> 07:55.073
I'm a veteran;
federal laws don't apply to me.

07:56.543 --> 07:58.176
50 bucks a month for the gym?

07:58.211 --> 07:59.577
Do you use it?

07:59.612 --> 08:01.279
Uh, well, not in a while.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.848
I was gonna go last week,
but I guess they moved

08:03.883 --> 08:05.617
because now it's
an Outback Steakhouse.

08:07.287 --> 08:09.988
So I just did that.
Ah.

08:10.023 --> 08:13.591
You are wasting
600 bucks a year.

08:13.626 --> 08:15.093
Are you hearing this?

08:15.128 --> 08:16.895
Well, he's got a point.

08:16.930 --> 08:20.064
I mean, the gym is a luxury
you don't need right now.

08:20.099 --> 08:22.234
I mean, you already hooked me.
Who are you trying to impress?

08:23.202 --> 08:24.536
And look at this.

08:24.571 --> 08:27.305
"Starbucks, Starbucks,
Starbucks."

08:27.340 --> 08:28.873
Five bucks a day for coffee

08:28.908 --> 08:30.575
when you can make
it here for free.

08:30.610 --> 08:32.911
Oh, actually those charges
are mine, you can skip those.

08:34.647 --> 08:37.115
Yeah, Dad, if you add all that
coffee money up, what's that?

08:37.150 --> 08:38.316
Almost $2,000
a year.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.851
Ah.

08:39.886 --> 08:42.186
$2,000 a year on coffee.

08:42.221 --> 08:43.988
Hmm.

08:44.023 --> 08:48.026
Wait, $2,000 a year on coffee?!

08:49.362 --> 08:51.329
I need to put you
two on a budget.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.097
I'm gonna take
all your bills

08:53.132 --> 08:54.232
and we'll go through
everything tomorrow

08:54.267 --> 08:55.633
when you come to the house.

08:55.668 --> 08:57.235
Party time is over.

08:57.270 --> 09:00.572
But I don't want
party time to be over.

09:00.607 --> 09:04.142
Yeah. How are you feeling about
that short-term pain now, huh?

09:04.177 --> 09:06.144
Boop.

09:08.147 --> 09:10.648
How dare your dad
go after my lattes.

09:10.683 --> 09:12.250
I mean, they are the first thing
I think about when I wake up

09:12.285 --> 09:13.851
in the morning and the
last thing I think about when

09:13.886 --> 09:15.019
I go to sleep at night.

09:15.054 --> 09:16.655
Thanks, honey.

09:18.057 --> 09:20.258
Adam, he has
to be stopped.
I know.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.126
He's trying to cancel
my Outback membership.

09:22.161 --> 09:23.928
You know,
we always agreed

09:23.963 --> 09:25.263
we'd never fight
about money.

09:25.298 --> 09:27.131
That said, this
is all your fault.

09:27.166 --> 09:29.133
You should have never taken
that money from my dad.

09:29.168 --> 09:30.602
You are 100% right.

09:30.637 --> 09:32.337
Boy, I like hearing that
in the bathroom,

09:32.372 --> 09:33.705
it's got a nice echo.

09:36.209 --> 09:38.977
(both slurp)

09:41.981 --> 09:44.682
I mean, he wants to look
at all of our money stuff.

09:44.717 --> 09:47.151
That's not happening.
No, it's not.

09:47.186 --> 09:48.386
Okay, we have got to draw
a line in the sand.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.654
We're gonna go over there
and tell him

09:49.689 --> 09:50.655
to stay out of our business.

09:50.690 --> 09:52.290
Yeah, you are.
N-No, I said "we."

09:52.325 --> 09:54.158
And I said "you."

09:54.193 --> 09:56.027
No, no, we'll do it together,
all right?

09:56.062 --> 09:57.962
And then afterward,
we're gonna stop by my gym

09:57.997 --> 09:59.931
and have some cheese fries
and a beer.

10:07.006 --> 10:08.406
Hey.
Hey, everybody.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.174
Hey.
Hi.
Should we talk to your dad now?

10:10.209 --> 10:11.309
No, no, no, no.

10:11.344 --> 10:12.977
Let's soften him up first.

10:13.012 --> 10:14.379
Hey, kids, go give
Grandpa kisses

10:14.414 --> 10:16.714
and put him in
a good mood.

10:16.749 --> 10:20.318
Like Mom tells us to do to you
when she wants something?

10:20.353 --> 10:22.320
What?
Nothing. Go, go.

10:22.355 --> 10:25.723
Go, go. Kids.
(babbles, chuckles)

10:25.758 --> 10:27.659
Okay, since we're all here now,

10:27.694 --> 10:29.994
let's settle this
Don birthday controversy.

10:30.029 --> 10:31.729
It's not a controversy.

10:31.764 --> 10:34.332
We can't even agree
on what to call it.

10:34.367 --> 10:37.201
Look, since you two can't decide
who should have Don's party,

10:37.236 --> 10:39.203
maybe you should consider
a neutral location,

10:39.238 --> 10:42.106
like Chuck E. Cheese.

10:42.141 --> 10:44.709
Well, that sounds fun.
Good food, great music.

10:45.745 --> 10:47.245
Uh, I just think
I should host it.

10:47.280 --> 10:50.348
I mean, after all, I was there
for Don's real birthday.

10:50.383 --> 10:53.151
Oh. It was like
pushing out a buffalo.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.352
(laughing):
Yeah.

10:54.387 --> 10:55.753
He was too big for
the baby scale,

10:55.788 --> 10:57.221
so they had to take
him to a supermarket

10:57.256 --> 10:59.457
and weigh him like a watermelon.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.226
Well, and,
and because of that, Adam,

11:02.261 --> 11:04.228
don't you think
I should host the party?

11:04.263 --> 11:05.930
Just let Marcy have it.

11:05.965 --> 11:07.331
Yeah, you pushed out
the buffalo,

11:07.366 --> 11:08.900
but she has to live with it.

11:08.935 --> 11:11.102
Okay.

11:11.137 --> 11:12.470
Let's have it at Marcy's.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.038
I'm not
a sore loser.

11:14.073 --> 11:15.339
I'll even come over early

11:15.374 --> 11:16.908
and give you a hand
with the cooking.

11:16.943 --> 11:18.143
So everything's not so salty.

11:19.479 --> 11:22.280
(phone rings)

11:24.283 --> 11:26.017
Hey, Lowell.
Do they still have it?

11:26.052 --> 11:27.251
Sounds good, be right there.

11:27.286 --> 11:29.120
What was that about?

11:29.155 --> 11:33.357
Wrong number. And completely
unrelated, I got to go.

11:33.392 --> 11:34.926
(door closes)

11:34.961 --> 11:36.260
All right, you two.

11:36.295 --> 11:37.929
Let's get started
with these bills.

11:37.964 --> 11:40.932
Uh, actually, we need
to talk to you about that.

11:40.967 --> 11:42.133
Yeah, uh...

11:42.168 --> 11:43.367
First of all, Dad,

11:43.402 --> 11:45.269
thank you for the
loan, but we think

11:45.304 --> 11:46.938
we can handle
our own finances.

11:46.973 --> 11:48.272
We may decide to cut
back on the coffees...

11:48.307 --> 11:49.273
Nope.

11:49.308 --> 11:51.275
...or keep it the same,

11:51.310 --> 11:53.377
but it'll be our decision.

11:53.412 --> 11:55.413
What a surprise,
you don't want my help.

11:55.448 --> 11:58.049
Well, you wouldn't take my
advice when you started out.

11:58.084 --> 11:59.283
Why would you take it now?

11:59.318 --> 12:02.053
Dad, that's got nothing
to do with this.

12:02.088 --> 12:04.155
You know, when Adam got out
of school, I pulled some strings

12:04.190 --> 12:07.492
and got him a job fixing trucks
for the city, just like me.

12:07.527 --> 12:10.528
Steady paycheck,
benefits, a pension.

12:10.563 --> 12:13.531
But no, he was too good
to fix trucks.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.933
Oh, h-hang on, Joe,
that's not fair.

12:15.968 --> 12:18.202
I never said I was too
good to fix trucks.

12:18.237 --> 12:19.270
You didn't have to say it.

12:19.305 --> 12:21.439
What is your problem with me?

12:21.474 --> 12:23.407
You have poor judgment.

12:23.442 --> 12:24.408
But it makes sense.

12:24.443 --> 12:26.177
After Donny paved the way,

12:26.212 --> 12:29.013
you dropped out of your mother
right onto your head.

12:30.983 --> 12:33.051
I never knew that!

12:35.321 --> 12:38.356
That's why I have that
flat spot-- I can't talk to him.

12:40.993 --> 12:41.993
All I know is,

12:42.028 --> 12:43.327
we were all getting along fine

12:43.362 --> 12:46.131
until we agreed
to have Don's party at Marcy's.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.202
There's the computers.
I'll just go grab mine.

12:51.237 --> 12:52.970
No, I don't think
this is a good idea.

12:53.005 --> 12:55.140
The librarian's not even here.

12:59.378 --> 13:00.912
What are you doing?

13:00.947 --> 13:03.347
Now she's here.

13:03.382 --> 13:05.216
Put it down
or I'll call the cops.

13:05.251 --> 13:07.018
But it was donated by mistake.
It's mine.

13:07.053 --> 13:10.021
Well, why should I believe you?

13:10.056 --> 13:11.355
(sighs)

13:11.390 --> 13:13.357
Because you're beautiful.

13:13.392 --> 13:16.127
(laughing):
Oh, what? You...

13:16.162 --> 13:19.997
Hey-- no, no,
that is not good enough.

13:20.032 --> 13:22.366
If that is really your computer,
you're gonna have to prove it.

13:22.401 --> 13:24.035
(sighs)
Fine.

13:24.070 --> 13:26.370
I didn't want to have
to do this.

13:26.405 --> 13:29.240
There's some very private videos
in here with me in them.

13:29.275 --> 13:30.241
Oh, no.

13:30.276 --> 13:31.943
It's not what you think.

13:31.978 --> 13:33.144
It's just me by myself.

13:33.179 --> 13:34.445
No, no.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.247
Now, be gentle.

13:36.282 --> 13:38.249
It's a bad angle,
so I don't look great.

13:38.284 --> 13:40.185
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

13:44.991 --> 13:47.124
Hello, Madison Square Garden!

13:47.159 --> 13:49.026
It's me, Don!

13:49.061 --> 13:50.394
(imitates cheering)

13:50.429 --> 13:52.263
Great to be here.

13:52.298 --> 13:54.966
I was just in Japan,
I'm huge over there.

13:55.001 --> 13:58.269
I mean, literally. Much taller
than the average Japanese man.

13:58.304 --> 13:59.904
Whoa, whoa,

13:59.939 --> 14:01.138
whoa, whoa!

14:01.173 --> 14:02.940
(laughs)

14:02.975 --> 14:04.942
Someone's getting
a little frisky over there.

14:04.977 --> 14:07.011
I'm talking to you, Glenn Close.

14:07.046 --> 14:09.146
(Don laughing)

14:09.181 --> 14:13.050
In a way, that was almost worse
than what I was expecting.

14:13.085 --> 14:15.186
I'm sorry you had to see that.
The lighting was bad.

14:15.221 --> 14:17.154
I kind of dug it.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.490
Really?

14:19.525 --> 14:24.161
Yeah. Are you, by any chance,
a single fella?

14:24.196 --> 14:26.163
Oh, I'm sorry, honey,

14:26.198 --> 14:28.499
this book's
already been checked out.

14:28.534 --> 14:31.202
But it's always nice
to meet a fan.

14:36.008 --> 14:37.975
We can't wait
for that mini-mall check.

14:38.010 --> 14:39.210
We are paying him back now.

14:39.245 --> 14:41.178
Okay, well...

14:41.213 --> 14:43.414
There's that treasure map
in Emme's pirate game.

14:43.449 --> 14:46.284
Maybe that leads somewhere.

14:46.319 --> 14:48.319
All right, look, I know we
agreed to never touch it,

14:48.354 --> 14:51.422
but how's our emergency
rainy day fund?

14:51.457 --> 14:53.324
Uh, it's not looking good.

14:53.359 --> 14:55.059
You remember,
the washer went out,

14:55.094 --> 14:56.994
and then the dryer
went out a week later,

14:57.029 --> 15:00.064
like a sweet old couple?

15:00.099 --> 15:03.200
There's got to be some
way to pay my dad back.

15:03.235 --> 15:04.402
(knocking on door)

15:04.437 --> 15:06.537
I don't think
paying the money back

15:06.572 --> 15:09.440
is gonna solve the problem
between you two.

15:09.475 --> 15:10.942
Oh, hi, Bev.

15:10.977 --> 15:13.010
Hi, Andi.

15:13.045 --> 15:17.114
Adam, I don't like what happened
between you and your father.

15:17.149 --> 15:21.118
Oh, Ma, you don't have
to apologize for him.

15:21.153 --> 15:23.354
But you came all this way,
so go ahead.

15:23.389 --> 15:24.522
No.

15:24.557 --> 15:26.257
I'm not gonna apologize for him.

15:26.292 --> 15:28.225
You're the one
who should apologize.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.461
What? Ma.

15:30.496 --> 15:33.164
Why do you think he was snooping
around your office

15:33.199 --> 15:34.465
and going through your bills?

15:34.500 --> 15:36.534
He says
it's because he's a veteran

15:36.569 --> 15:39.236
and it's his legal right.

15:39.271 --> 15:42.139
Adam.
(chuckles)

15:42.174 --> 15:45.042
Is it so hard to understand

15:45.077 --> 15:48.179
that an old man
wants to feel necessary

15:48.214 --> 15:50.514
and looked up to by his son?

15:50.549 --> 15:54.085
Well if that's how he feels,
he should just say that.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.553
Well, hold on.

15:55.588 --> 15:58.323
You're not that great
at talking about your feelings.

15:59.558 --> 16:02.059
(laughs) It's very unfair of you
to bring up a good point

16:02.094 --> 16:03.962
like that right now.

16:05.164 --> 16:07.732
All he wants is to feel needed.

16:07.767 --> 16:10.735
That's why he wanted to get you
that job 30 years ago,

16:10.770 --> 16:13.270
and that's why he's sticking
his nose in your business now.

16:13.305 --> 16:17.141
And all Adam wants is for
his dad to be proud of him

16:17.176 --> 16:20.277
and, and trust him to
do things on his own.

16:20.312 --> 16:24.182
Aw, they both want things
they can't ask for.

16:26.218 --> 16:28.453
It's like a Meg Ryan movie.

16:30.523 --> 16:34.325
But they're both Meg Ryan.

16:36.195 --> 16:37.795
Eh... Look, I didn't know.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.497
I'm sorry.

16:39.532 --> 16:42.533
You should be. You've,
you've upset your father...

16:44.136 --> 16:48.305
...and you've upset me
very, very much.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.207
All right, all right.
I'll figure out a way

16:50.242 --> 16:51.809
to make it up
to him. And, Ma,

16:51.844 --> 16:53.411
I wish there was
something I could do

16:53.446 --> 16:55.146
to make it up to you, too.

16:56.348 --> 16:58.349
Well...

17:01.120 --> 17:03.354
There is one thing.

17:08.127 --> 17:10.094
Uh, Marcy,

17:10.129 --> 17:14.398
uh, we talked about it,
and Andi and I think

17:14.433 --> 17:19.137
that Don's birthday should be
at Mom's house and not yours.

17:21.107 --> 17:22.440
What's the... We agree

17:22.475 --> 17:25.142
that the, uh, best person
to throw a birthday party

17:25.177 --> 17:28.046
for a married,
adult man is his mother.

17:31.350 --> 17:35.553
Oh, Adam, Andi,
this is out of nowhere.

17:38.491 --> 17:40.458
Is there anything else?

17:40.493 --> 17:43.227
We just thought
it was important to tell you

17:43.262 --> 17:47.398
because your cooking
is too, too salty.

17:48.534 --> 17:51.602
What does she have on you?

17:51.637 --> 17:54.505
So much.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.242
Â¶ Happy birthday

17:58.277 --> 18:01.245
Â¶ To you.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.848
(laughs)
(whooping, applause)

18:03.883 --> 18:06.250
All right!
(cheering)

18:06.285 --> 18:08.252
I don't want to say
this is the best party ever,

18:08.287 --> 18:11.155
but I wouldn't mind
if somebody else said it.

18:11.190 --> 18:13.157
It was lovely, Bev.

18:13.192 --> 18:14.558
And since you hosted
Don's birthday,

18:14.593 --> 18:16.760
it's only fair
that I host Christmas.

18:16.795 --> 18:18.196
Everybody heard it, I win.

18:20.299 --> 18:21.832
Marcy with the left
hook out of nowhere.

18:21.867 --> 18:23.267
(chuckles)

18:23.302 --> 18:24.401
Dad, you want a piece of cake?

18:24.436 --> 18:26.104
I'm fine.

18:28.207 --> 18:30.875
Well, I did everything I could.

18:30.910 --> 18:33.844
No, you,
you offered him cake.

18:33.879 --> 18:36.413
Y-You need to offer him love.

18:36.448 --> 18:38.782
What?

18:38.817 --> 18:40.518
I say walk over
and give him a big hug.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.786
Ooh, that's good.

18:42.821 --> 18:44.421
No, it's not.

18:44.456 --> 18:45.890
Last time I had
my arms around him,

18:45.925 --> 18:47.825
he was choking on a meatball.

18:49.895 --> 18:51.562
You know what?
I know what to do.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.634
(clears throat)

18:59.872 --> 19:01.805
Hey, Dad, um...

19:01.840 --> 19:03.507
You know
that, that old motorcycle

19:03.542 --> 19:05.309
that Don and I
are putting back together?

19:05.344 --> 19:06.443
Well, I'm having
a problem

19:06.478 --> 19:08.312
with the float bowl
on the carburetor.

19:08.347 --> 19:09.780
Think you could
take a look at it?

19:09.815 --> 19:11.315
It'd really be a big help.

19:11.350 --> 19:13.451
Oh?

19:14.553 --> 19:17.188
Well, yeah, yeah, sure.

19:17.223 --> 19:18.556
I-I can do that.

19:19.525 --> 19:21.792
But you don't need me.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.460
Well, sure I do.

19:23.495 --> 19:26.430
Oh, you're really great
at that stuff.

19:26.465 --> 19:29.367
Yeah. Well...

19:30.536 --> 19:32.270
Thanks.

19:33.806 --> 19:35.439
(whispering): Say you
learned it from him.

19:35.474 --> 19:36.774
Would you mind? We're doing it.

19:36.809 --> 19:37.942
Okay.

19:42.881 --> 19:45.449
Uh, uh, so, uh,
so Saturday, then?

19:45.484 --> 19:46.917
Yeah, I'm looking forward to it.

19:46.952 --> 19:49.253
Yeah, me, too.

19:50.389 --> 19:53.257
(mouths)

19:54.260 --> 19:56.860
Are they saying
that you should hug me?

19:56.895 --> 19:59.430
Yeah.

19:59.465 --> 20:00.564
We can't do it.
We give them one,

20:00.599 --> 20:02.366
they'll want it all the time.

20:09.842 --> 20:10.908
You know, the other day,
I was forced

20:10.943 --> 20:12.643
to face
one of my biggest fears.

20:14.346 --> 20:16.247
Sharing my gift with the world.

20:17.683 --> 20:19.416
And I realized, after I made

20:19.451 --> 20:20.918
a librarian fall
in love with me...

20:20.953 --> 20:22.019
What's that now?

20:22.054 --> 20:23.320
That...

20:23.355 --> 20:24.888
it would just be selfish

20:24.923 --> 20:26.523
for me to keep
what I have hidden.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.525
So sit back and relax.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.527
Something tells me
we're gonna be a lot closer

20:30.562 --> 20:32.563
after this three-hour journey.

20:40.472 --> 20:42.506
What, not even a foot tap?
Nothing?

20:45.477 --> 20:47.845
Your brother's playing!
Tap your foot!
