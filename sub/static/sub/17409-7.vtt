APPROPRIATE OPEN-MINDED RESPONSE

18:54.830 --> 18:56.491
IS SUPPOSED TO BE, AND THEN

18:56.500 --> 18:57.728
FOLLOW THROUGH.

18:57.730 --> 18:58.890
ESPECIALLY IF THAT'S NOT WHAT

18:58.900 --> 19:00.367
YOUR HEART IS TELLING YOU IS THE

19:00.370 --> 19:01.598
RIGHT THING TO DO.

19:01.600 --> 19:03.830
YOUR NECK ISN'T SPASMING BECAUSE

19:03.840 --> 19:05.467
YOU'RE INFLEXIBLE.

19:05.470 --> 19:06.960
YOUR NECK IS SPASMING BECAUSE

19:06.970 --> 19:08.437
YOU'RE NOT BEING HONEST WITH WHO

19:08.440 --> 19:10.305
YOU ARE.

19:10.310 --> 19:12.198
Sean: ACCORDING TO EVERYONE

19:12.210 --> 19:13.609
IN MY LIFE, WHO I AM IS

19:13.620 --> 19:14.973
A RIGID PRICK.

19:14.980 --> 19:16.675
Woman: DON'T JUDGE YOURSELF.

19:16.680 --> 19:18.580
WHEN YOU WANT WATER, A ROCK IS

19:18.590 --> 19:20.217
USELESS...

19:20.220 --> 19:21.710
BUT IT'S THE BEST THING IN THE

19:21.720 --> 19:22.687
WORLD WHEN YOU WANT TO KEEP

19:22.690 --> 19:23.622
SOMETHING IMPORTANT FROM FLYING

19:23.630 --> 19:25.484
AWAY.

19:25.490 --> 19:27.799
Sean: I'M A ROCK.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.860
Woman: NOW ROLL OVER AND I'LL

19:30.870 --> 19:32.667
OPEN THAT NECK UP.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.330
Sean: I, UM...

19:39.340 --> 19:42.673
I JUST NEED A SECOND.

19:47.420 --> 19:49.411
Woman: OH.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.507
Sean: I SHOULD GO.

20:17.510 --> 20:21.970
I'M REALLY SORRY.

20:21.980 --> 20:23.845
Woman: SEAN, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

20:23.850 --> 20:25.579
IT HAPPENS.

20:25.590 --> 20:27.478
LOOK, IT WAS UNPROFESSIONAL OF

20:27.490 --> 20:28.957
ME TO START WORKING ON YOU

20:28.960 --> 20:30.382
WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT WHAT

20:30.390 --> 20:31.652
HAPPENED BETWEEN US.

20:31.660 --> 20:33.992
I'M GLAD IT HAPPENED.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.025
I'M NOT UPSET ABOUT IT.

20:36.030 --> 20:38.669
WE WERE BOTH FEELING LONELY,

20:38.670 --> 20:39.694
AND FOR THAT MOMENT, COMING

20:39.700 --> 20:40.837
TOGETHER MADE THAT FEELING GO

20:40.840 --> 20:42.467
AWAY.

20:42.470 --> 20:50.775
BUT NOW THAT MOMENT IS GONE.

20:50.780 --> 20:54.546
IT HAS TO BE GONE.

20:54.550 --> 20:56.677
Sean: GOOD. I'M GLAD.

20:56.680 --> 20:58.682
I WAS WORRIED YOU THOUGHT IT WAS

20:58.690 --> 20:59.941
MORE THAN IT WAS.

20:59.950 --> 21:02.555
CAN I SEE YOU AGAIN...

21:02.560 --> 21:04.721
ON A PROFESSIONAL BASIS?

21:04.730 --> 21:06.027
Woman: PLEASE.

21:06.030 --> 21:07.395
THAT SWELLING ISN'T GOING AWAY

21:07.400 --> 21:08.958
ON ITS OWN.

21:08.960 --> 21:10.894
[BOTH LAUGH NERVOUSLY]

21:10.900 --> 21:15.690
Sean: YEAH.

21:15.700 --> 21:18.498
Woman: LOOK, TRY TO BE HONEST

21:18.510 --> 21:20.535
WITH YOUR FEELINGS UNTIL THEN...

21:20.540 --> 21:22.974
NO MATTER WHAT THEY ARE.

21:28.580 --> 21:29.740
Sean: WOULD NOW BE

21:29.750 --> 21:30.819
THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO

21:30.820 --> 21:31.912
BREAK OUT THE CYANIDE KOOL-AID?

21:31.920 --> 21:33.080
Julia: I REALLY NEED YOUR

21:33.090 --> 21:34.455
SUPPORT TONIGHT, SEAN.

21:34.460 --> 21:35.779
Sean: YOU'VE GOT IT.

21:42.460 --> 21:43.461
Man: CAN WE START THIS THING

21:43.470 --> 21:44.459
NOW?

21:44.470 --> 21:46.119
Julia: OK, EVERYBODY.

21:46.130 --> 21:48.598
WELL, WE ALL KNOW WHY WE'RE

21:48.600 --> 21:49.589
HERE.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.363
SOMETHING A LITTLE DISTURBING

21:51.370 --> 21:53.031
HAS HAPPENED, AND I THINK WE

21:53.040 --> 21:54.871
SHOULD ALL TALK ABOUT IT SO THAT

21:54.880 --> 21:56.973
WE KNOW IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

21:56.980 --> 21:58.402
AGREED?

22:00.850 --> 22:03.717
Sean: THIS IS GONNA HAVE TO BE

22:03.720 --> 22:05.119
A FRANK CONVERSATION.

22:05.120 --> 22:06.109
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT WE'RE

22:06.120 --> 22:07.109
ALL ADULTS.

22:07.120 --> 22:09.156
WE'VE ALL HAD SEX.

22:09.160 --> 22:10.821
OTHERWISE, NONE OF YOU KIDS

22:10.830 --> 22:14.948
WOULD BE HERE.

22:14.960 --> 22:17.599
WE JUST NEED TO REMEMBER TO BE

22:17.600 --> 22:19.022
HONEST WITH OUR FEELINGS,

22:19.030 --> 22:21.635
NO MATTER WHAT THEY ARE.

22:21.640 --> 22:22.766
Matt: WELL, WHAT'S THE POINT IN

22:22.770 --> 22:25.136
TALKING WHEN MOM'S ALREADY

22:25.140 --> 22:26.164
DECIDED THAT WHAT WE WERE DOING

22:26.170 --> 22:27.159
IS WRONG?

22:27.170 --> 22:28.774
Julia: IT WAS WRONG, MATT.

22:28.780 --> 22:30.771
IT HAD SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES

22:30.780 --> 22:31.849
THAT I DON'T THINK YOU'VE EVEN

22:31.850 --> 22:32.942
CONSIDERED.

22:32.950 --> 22:35.475
PREGNANCY, DISEASE,

22:35.480 --> 22:36.777
HURT FEELINGS.

22:36.780 --> 22:37.883
YOU KNOW, YOU KIDS, YOU THINK

22:37.890 --> 22:38.948
YOU'RE ALL GROWN UP, BUT YOU'RE

22:38.950 --> 22:39.939
NOT.

22:39.950 --> 22:40.951
Woman: I DON'T SEE WHAT THE BIG

22:40.960 --> 22:41.949
DEAL IS.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.018
I READ THIS THING IN PEOPLE

22:43.020 --> 22:44.521
ABOUT 12-YEAR-OLDS GIVING

22:44.530 --> 22:45.929
BLOW-JOBS TO THEIR SECRET

22:45.930 --> 22:46.919
SANTAS.

22:46.930 --> 22:48.192
THIS STUFF IS JUST KIDS BEING

22:48.200 --> 22:49.553
KIDS NOWADAYS.

22:49.560 --> 22:50.720
Julia: I'M SORRY, ALEXI.

22:50.730 --> 22:52.789
STEALING A 6-PACK IS KIDS BEING

22:52.800 --> 22:53.960
KIDS.

22:53.970 --> 22:55.790
THIS IS MUCH MORE THAN THAT.

22:55.800 --> 22:57.062
Sean: HOLD ON A MINUTE, JULIA.

22:57.070 --> 22:59.106
THERE WAS A DOCUMENTARY RECENTLY

22:59.110 --> 23:00.930
WHERE A MAN NAMED MARILYN MANSON

23:00.940 --> 23:02.476
SAID THAT IF HE COULD SAY

23:02.480 --> 23:04.209
ANYTHING TO THE KIDS OF AMERICA,

23:04.210 --> 23:05.199
HE WOULDN'T SAY A WORD.

23:05.210 --> 23:08.919
HE'D LISTEN.

23:08.920 --> 23:12.185
MATT, WE OBVIOUSLY DON'T

23:12.190 --> 23:13.088
UNDERSTAND WHY YOU KIDS DID

23:13.090 --> 23:13.909
THIS.

23:13.920 --> 23:14.909
WHY DON'T YOU TRY TO EXPLAIN IT

23:14.920 --> 23:15.682
TO US?

23:15.690 --> 23:16.588
Julia: I DON'T WANT

23:16.590 --> 23:17.522
AN EXPLANATION.

23:17.530 --> 23:19.088
I WANT HIM TO PROMISE THAT IT

23:19.090 --> 23:20.557
WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

23:20.560 --> 23:21.549
Sean: AN EMPTY PROMISE ISN'T

23:21.560 --> 23:22.652
GONNA GET TO THE SOURCE OF THE

23:22.660 --> 23:23.695
PROBLEM, IF THERE IS A PROBLEM

23:23.700 --> 23:24.689
AT ALL.

23:24.700 --> 23:26.019
Matt: HOW CAN YOU EVEN LOOK AT

23:26.030 --> 23:27.019
YOURSELVES IN THE MIRROR AND

23:27.030 --> 23:28.031
CALL WHAT WE WERE DOING

23:28.040 --> 23:29.496
A PROBLEM?

23:29.500 --> 23:31.559
DAD SPENDS ONE WEEK AT HOME,

23:31.570 --> 23:32.662
THE NEXT IN A MOTEL.

23:32.670 --> 23:33.978
MOM SPENDS ALL OF HER TIME WITH

23:33.980 --> 23:35.106
SOME GUY WHO'S BARELY OLDER THAN

23:35.110 --> 23:36.099
ME.

23:36.110 --> 23:39.102
WE WERE HAVING SEX, JUST LIKE

23:40.580 --> 23:41.615
WORLD...

23:41.620 --> 23:42.917
WITH A CONDOM THAT DAD GAVE ME,

23:42.920 --> 23:43.909
SO--

23:43.920 --> 23:44.909
Man: WELL! LOOKS LIKE WE FOUND

23:44.920 --> 23:46.114
THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM.

23:46.120 --> 23:47.109
Julia: EXCUSE ME, BUT ARE YOU

23:47.120 --> 23:48.587
BLAMING US FOR THIS?

23:48.590 --> 23:49.579
Woman: I'M SORRY, BUT WHOSE

23:49.590 --> 23:50.989
HOUSE DID THIS HAPPEN IN?

23:50.990 --> 23:53.788
OURS, LEXI'S, OR THIS OPIUM DEN?

23:53.800 --> 23:54.721
Girl: THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE

23:54.730 --> 23:56.550
MY MOM'S UNEMPLOYED AND YOU GUYS

23:56.560 --> 23:57.629
TOOK ALL THE LOCKS OFF VAN ESSA'S

23:57.630 --> 23:58.562
DOORS.

23:58.570 --> 23:59.229
Alexi: TRUST ME, HONEY.

23:59.230 --> 24:00.128
BEING ON ALIMONY IS NOT BEING

24:00.130 --> 24:01.028
UNEMPLOYED.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.735
Sean: WHOA! PLACING BLAME ISN'T

24:02.740 --> 24:03.729
GONNA GET US ANYWHERE.

24:03.740 --> 24:05.002
JULIA IS A GOOD PARENT.

24:05.010 --> 24:06.204
WE'RE ALL GOOD PARENTS.

24:06.210 --> 24:07.734
Man: GOOD PARENTS TEACH THEIR

24:07.740 --> 24:09.105
SON HOW TO KEEP HIS DICK IN HIS

24:09.110 --> 24:10.941
PANTS AND TO BE SMART ENOUGH

24:10.950 --> 24:11.871
NOT TO TRY TO CUT IT OFF.

24:11.880 --> 24:12.801
Girl: DADDY!

24:12.810 --> 24:13.845
Sean: ROBERT, YOU ARE OUT OF

24:13.850 --> 24:14.839
LINE.

24:14.850 --> 24:15.839
Robert: FINE. I'M SORRY.

24:15.850 --> 24:16.976
BUT TO BE HONEST, I DON'T CARE

24:16.980 --> 24:18.140
WHOSE FAULT THIS IS.

24:18.150 --> 24:19.139
I WOULD JUST RATHER NOT KNOW

24:19.150 --> 24:20.139
ANY MORE ABOUT MY DAUGHTER'S

24:20.150 --> 24:22.084
SEX LIFE THAN I ALREADY DO.

24:22.090 --> 24:23.079
SHE'S ASSURED US THAT THIS WAS

24:23.090 --> 24:24.159
A ONE-TIME THING, AND WE'RE

24:24.160 --> 24:26.128
SATISFIED WITH THAT.

24:26.130 --> 24:27.028
Julia: IS THIS TRUE, MATT?

24:27.030 --> 24:30.625
WAS IT A ONE-TIME THING?

24:30.630 --> 24:32.769
Matt: YEAH. PRETTY MUCH.

24:32.770 --> 24:33.759
Sean: RIDLEY, IS THIS YOUR

24:33.770 --> 24:35.761
STORY AS WELL?

24:35.770 --> 24:36.759
IT'S OK, HONEY.

24:36.770 --> 24:37.930
YOU CAN BE HONEST HERE.

24:37.940 --> 24:39.532
NO ONE'S GONNA GET UPSET.

24:39.540 --> 24:41.531
Ridley: WE'VE DONE IT BEFORE.

24:41.540 --> 24:43.701
I'M SORRY, VANESSA. I TRIED.

24:43.710 --> 24:45.268
WHAT DR. MCNAMARA SAID IS TRUE.

24:45.280 --> 24:46.747
I HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH MY

24:46.750 --> 24:47.774
FEELINGS NO MATTER WHAT THEY

24:47.780 --> 24:48.769
ARE.

24:48.780 --> 24:49.940
I'M NOT LIKE YOU.

24:49.950 --> 24:52.145
I'M NOT A LEZZIE.

24:52.150 --> 24:53.754
Woman: WHAT'S A LEZZIE?

24:53.760 --> 24:54.749
Alexi: YOUR DAUGHTER LIKES

24:54.760 --> 24:56.648
VAGINA.

24:56.660 --> 24:57.649
Ridley: I REALLY LIKE YOU,

24:57.660 --> 24:58.649
VAN ESSA.

24:58.660 --> 24:59.922
I THINK YOU'RE COOL AND PRETTY

24:59.930 --> 25:02.319
AND SEXY AND ALL, BUT I'M IN

25:02.330 --> 25:03.627
LOVE WITH MATT NOW.

25:03.630 --> 25:05.268
WE'VE BEEN SEEING EACH OTHER.

25:09.070 --> 25:10.958
Vanessa: THAT'S NOT TRUE.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.805
DENY IT, MATT.

25:19.080 --> 25:21.617
DENY IT, MATT.

25:29.120 --> 25:30.883
Vanessa: BUT I LOVE YOU.

25:32.890 --> 25:36.849
Woman: I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

25:36.860 --> 25:38.259
COME ON.

25:41.300 --> 25:42.892
Robert: OPEN AND HONEST ENOUGH

25:42.900 --> 25:44.299
FOR YOU?

25:53.950 --> 25:54.871
Julia: HONESTLY, AM I BEING TOO

25:54.880 --> 25:56.108
UPTIGHT ABOUT THIS?

25:56.120 --> 25:58.714
Jude: FOR MY TASTES, YES.

25:58.720 --> 26:01.655
BUT I'VE ALWAYS FOUND THREESOMES

26:01.660 --> 26:04.356
TO BE VERY SATISFYING.

26:04.360 --> 26:05.725
Julia: YOU'VE HAD ONE?

26:05.730 --> 26:09.052
JESUS! IS THERE ANYONE UNDER 30

26:09.060 --> 26:11.096
WHO STILL BELIEVES IN MONOGAMY?

26:11.100 --> 26:12.169
Jude: OH, THERE'S A BIG

26:12.170 --> 26:13.865
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MONOGAMY AND

26:13.870 --> 26:15.292
FIDELITY, JULES.

26:15.300 --> 26:16.232
JUST LOOK AT IT FROM MATT'S

26:16.240 --> 26:17.366
PERSPECTIVE.

26:17.370 --> 26:18.405
EVERY GUY WANTS A SHOVE AT

26:18.410 --> 26:20.037
2 GIRLS AT ONCE.

26:20.040 --> 26:21.029
YOU TELL ME YOU'VE NEVER

26:21.040 --> 26:22.200
FANTASIZED ABOUT BEING WITH

26:22.210 --> 26:25.748
2 MEN AT THE SAME TIME?

26:25.750 --> 26:27.001
Julia: WHAT ARE YOU GETTING ALL

26:27.010 --> 26:28.910
DOLLED UP FOR, A HOT DATE?

26:28.920 --> 26:31.411
Jude: YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

26:31.420 --> 26:32.910
Julia: COME ON.

26:32.920 --> 26:34.353
Jude: NO WAY. NOT AFTER HOW YOU

26:34.360 --> 26:35.213
REACT ED TO MATT'S LITTLE

26:35.220 --> 26:36.357
MENAGE.

26:36.360 --> 26:38.055
Julia: I'M NOT A PRUDE.

26:38.060 --> 26:39.755
I JUST HOLD MY KIDS TO HIGHER

26:39.760 --> 26:43.025
STANDARDS.

26:43.030 --> 26:46.124
Jude: WELL, YOU KNOW THOSE--

26:46.130 --> 26:47.836
THE PHOTOS YOU SAW THE OTHER

26:47.840 --> 26:48.989
DAY.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.865
Julia: REMIND ME AGAIN?

26:50.870 --> 26:53.998
Jude: THE PROVOCATIVE ONES?

26:54.010 --> 26:56.274
WELL, THEY WERE AUDITION SHOTS

26:56.280 --> 26:57.269
FOR A PARTY.

26:57.280 --> 26:59.202
Julia: WHAT KIND OF PARTY DO YOU

26:59.210 --> 27:00.404
HAVE TO AUDITION FOR TO GET

27:00.410 --> 27:01.411
INTO?

27:01.420 --> 27:05.015
Jude: A SWINGERS PARTY.

27:05.020 --> 27:05.884
ARE YOU STILL FEELING

27:05.890 --> 27:07.243
OPEN-MINDED?

27:07.250 --> 27:09.684
Julia: NO. I MEAN, YES!

27:09.690 --> 27:13.057
I'M JUST SURPRISED.

27:13.060 --> 27:14.129
YOU TAKE SUCH GOOD CARE OF YOUR

27:14.130 --> 27:15.097
BODY.

27:15.100 --> 27:15.998
AREN'T YOU WORRIED ABOUT

27:16.000 --> 27:16.955
DISEASES?

27:18.200 --> 27:20.327
Julia: YOU'RE STILL SLEEPING

27:20.330 --> 27:21.433
