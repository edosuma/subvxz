31:20.464 --> 31:22.549
It was, like, a 10.
‐ Yeah. Okay.

31:22.549 --> 31:24.051
‐ Yeah, we're doin' it again.

31:24.051 --> 31:26.303
This weekend. Paul's house.
Bring the party supplies.

31:26.303 --> 31:28.430
‐ Wait. Paul's parents
are letting him do that again?

31:28.430 --> 31:30.307
‐ Paul's parents
don't give a fuck about anything.

31:30.307 --> 31:31.350
It's very dark.

31:31.350 --> 31:34.269
Just bring that sweet, sweet drink
and that loud‐ass dank.

31:34.269 --> 31:35.896
You know what I'm saying?
‐ [chuckles]

31:35.896 --> 31:38.065
Dude, that was sort of, like,
a one‐time thing. I'm not like a‐‐

31:38.065 --> 31:41.610
‐ Listen, man.
I need this, all right?

31:41.610 --> 31:43.820
If I don't get my penis touched
once in my life, I'll kill myself.

31:43.820 --> 31:45.989
‐ I thought you said
Lauren touched your penis that one time.

31:47.574 --> 31:48.784
‐ That was a lie.

31:50.953 --> 31:53.956
‐ Okay, yeah.
I'll talk to my guy, all right?

31:53.956 --> 31:56.291
Hey, Sophie! Sophie!

32:03.131 --> 32:04.591
Uh, you like coffee?

32:08.720 --> 32:11.306
‐ Yeah, bro, I can only get, like,
two ounces with my medical card.

32:11.306 --> 32:13.225
Nick, you got a card?
‐ Yo, man, can I swing?

32:13.225 --> 32:14.142
‐ Hey, honest opinion‐‐

32:15.310 --> 32:17.563
The kid's gonna ripped off.
You should go with him to the party.

32:17.563 --> 32:19.940
‐ I ain't goin' to the party.
‐ Why not?

32:19.940 --> 32:21.024
‐ Seriously, man, can I bat?

32:21.024 --> 32:23.819
‐ I can't go to the party,
because Mo's a minor.

32:23.819 --> 32:25.237
So, if Mo gets in trouble,

32:25.237 --> 32:26.989
he'll just get in trouble
like those kids get in trouble.

32:26.989 --> 32:29.575
You know, he'll have to,
like, erase a blackboard

32:29.575 --> 32:31.910
or go to detention.
Me? I'll do hard time!

32:31.910 --> 32:34.580
I'm not ready for that.
I can't be the face of this operation.

32:34.580 --> 32:37.291
‐ Well, I don't wanna be
the face of this operation, either.

32:38.667 --> 32:41.837
‐ Yo, hit.
‐ Oh, come on!

32:41.837 --> 32:43.505
‐ Step up, kid.

32:45.716 --> 32:47.426
ZEKE:
What the fuck was that?

32:47.426 --> 32:49.052
MO: That one didn't feel good.
‐ Do you listen?

32:49.052 --> 32:50.262
Remember what I told you?
‐ No.

32:50.262 --> 32:51.513
‐ You gotta use your height
to your advantage.

32:51.513 --> 32:53.140
You gotta get low,
so there's no strike zone.

32:53.140 --> 32:54.349
You'll walk every time.

32:54.349 --> 32:56.935
TONY: He's in a fucking cage, man.
He can't strike out.

32:57.769 --> 32:59.688
‐ This feels weird.
I never saw you do this.

32:59.688 --> 33:00.981
‐ 'Cause I was good.

33:02.024 --> 33:04.818
‐ Okay, if you're so good,
why'd you leave the team?

33:04.818 --> 33:06.570
‐ 'Cause it‐‐ it was very political.

33:07.321 --> 33:10.449
MO: Oh, hey, can you take the next right?
Take a right up there.

33:10.449 --> 33:12.201
ZEKE: Why? All right, all right.
Where are we going?

33:12.201 --> 33:14.494
‐ Uh, I just have to stop by
my sister's new place

33:14.494 --> 33:17.331
and pick up a box
that she wants me to store for her.

33:17.331 --> 33:19.291
‐ Huh? Fuck no! What?

33:19.291 --> 33:21.293
‐ What? Are you‐‐?
Why are you freaking out?

33:21.293 --> 33:23.504
‐ I can't just show up
to your sister's house unannounced.

33:23.504 --> 33:24.588
I'd look insane.

33:24.588 --> 33:26.340
‐ You're not showing up unannounced.
You're with me.

33:26.340 --> 33:28.634
‐ It's fucking weird, dude.
Does she know I'm coming?

33:30.260 --> 33:32.930
‐ No, but I didn't talk to her, okay?
My mom did.

33:32.930 --> 33:34.598
‐ This sucks, bro.
You suck.

33:34.598 --> 33:36.934
Dude, is her stupid‐ass boyfriend
gonna be there?

33:36.934 --> 33:39.061
[laughing]

33:39.937 --> 33:41.688
What are you laughing at.
‐ I don't know.

33:41.688 --> 33:44.441
It just‐‐ it brings me a lot of joy
to see you this flustered.

33:44.441 --> 33:45.692
Never seen you like this.

33:47.402 --> 33:48.403

33:52.741 --> 33:55.160
All right, I'm gonna wait in the car.

33:55.160 --> 33:56.620
MO: [scoffs]
Fine.

34:01.708 --> 34:03.752

like an asshole.

Wait up.

Hey, sorry about the boxes.
We're still moving in.

ZEKE: Uh‐huh.
MO: Yeah.

I used to love that spot as a kid.

you were bringing your babysitter.

‐ Okay.

34:39.496 --> 34:41.915
Don't you have homework or something?
‐ Yeah, don't you?

34:41.915 --> 34:44.918
'Cause then Mom and Dad
are gonna be mad at me,

34:44.918 --> 34:46.670

Coke for the little guy.

34:48.630 --> 34:50.299

my favorite artists working right now.

‐ Oh, that.
The painting. Yes.

35:04.646 --> 35:06.023
DOUG: Yeah, all of his stuff
sort of makes fun of

35:06.023 --> 35:08.150
the over‐commercialization
of the art market.

It's fascinating stuff.

Oh, that's nice.

35:17.868 --> 35:20.579

it'd be a really good investment, so...

35:20.579 --> 35:22.497
Kinda just been diving in head‐first.

35:22.497 --> 35:24.041
Oh, let me show you
this other thing I bought.

35:24.041 --> 35:25.292
‐ Ah, that's all right, man.

35:25.292 --> 35:27.127
DOUG: No, come on. You're gonna love it.
‐ Nah, I'm all right.

35:27.127 --> 35:29.880

‐ All right, fuck it.

35:36.470 --> 35:37.888

What?

35:42.309 --> 35:44.269
