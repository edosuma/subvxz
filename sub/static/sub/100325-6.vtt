00:01.000 --> 00:03.006
Previously, on Almost Family...

00:03.007 --> 00:04.939
How badly does the laptop hurt the case?

00:04.939 --> 00:06.649
It's their entire case, Julia.

00:06.650 --> 00:08.307
I made an offer to buy the gym.

00:08.308 --> 00:10.802
I'm glad that we can be
back in business together.

00:10.803 --> 00:13.164
We're not back in anything together.

00:13.165 --> 00:14.499
I don't wanna run anymore.

00:14.500 --> 00:16.868
So don't run. Walk, crawl, whatever,

00:16.869 --> 00:18.512
as long as it's in my direction.

00:18.513 --> 00:20.422
I'm falling in love with you.

00:20.423 --> 00:21.807
I'm falling in love with you too.

00:21.808 --> 00:23.208
What do we do now?

00:23.209 --> 00:25.610
I know you weren't
in the office all weekend.

00:25.611 --> 00:27.012
Where were you when I called you?

00:27.013 --> 00:28.747
What, are you cross-examining me now?

00:28.748 --> 00:30.066
Do I have to?

00:40.518 --> 00:42.277
- Ima!
- What happened?

00:42.278 --> 00:43.779
I fell off my bike.

00:43.780 --> 00:45.563
She did a wheelie.

00:45.564 --> 00:47.690
Oh, my brave girl.

00:47.691 --> 00:49.734
Hey, you know who you remind me of?

00:49.735 --> 00:53.756
Your great-grandma Estie
who you were named after.

00:53.757 --> 00:56.458
When she was little,
she used to play baseball

00:56.459 --> 01:00.387
with all the boys and everyone
wanted her on their team,

01:00.388 --> 01:03.465
because she had the fastest pitch

01:03.466 --> 01:05.391
in the neighborhood.

01:05.393 --> 01:07.585
And...

01:07.586 --> 01:08.970
good as new.

01:10.548 --> 01:13.091
Ah, the prince is awake. All right.

01:13.092 --> 01:14.717
Get back on your bike.

01:14.718 --> 01:16.403
Dinner will be ready in half an hour.

01:25.413 --> 01:27.772
New sign-in sheets. Mm-hmm.

01:30.276 --> 01:31.493
Hi, Dad.

01:31.494 --> 01:33.945
Do you want your skis? I'm decluttering.

01:33.946 --> 01:35.497
You still have those? It's been years.

01:35.498 --> 01:37.206
Oh, Jan. I approved payroll.

01:37.207 --> 01:38.541
- It's in your top drawer.
- Got it.

01:38.542 --> 01:40.660
- How is everything there?
- Busy.

01:40.661 --> 01:43.202
You know, um, I found
a pile of New Yorkers.

01:43.203 --> 01:45.582
You want me to drop 'em off
for the waiting room?

01:45.583 --> 01:47.125
No, thanks. We're good.

01:47.126 --> 01:49.010
You know, it might
be time for a refresh.

01:49.011 --> 01:51.438
We haven't upgraded our
magazine subscription

01:51.439 --> 01:52.940
since you graduated college.

01:52.941 --> 01:55.350
I think people like our selection.

01:55.351 --> 01:58.913
Hey, doesn't Grace Fields write
for National Geographic?

01:58.914 --> 02:00.339
I believe so, yes.

02:00.340 --> 02:02.387
Oh, how she doing, by the way?

02:02.388 --> 02:04.976
She must be, what, 30 weeks by now?

02:04.977 --> 02:08.029
- 32, Dad, but...
- Excellent.

02:08.030 --> 02:10.815
Well, I'm glad the
letrozole did the trick.

02:10.816 --> 02:12.721
Nice try. I'm not discussing
patients with you.

02:12.722 --> 02:14.819
Well, if I think it might help...

02:14.820 --> 02:18.281
Look, I know that I am
persona non grata,

02:18.282 --> 02:21.826
but, uh, it is still
the Bechley Institute,

02:21.827 --> 02:23.971
and last time I checked,
I am still a Bechley.

02:23.972 --> 02:25.330
And so am I.

02:25.331 --> 02:27.614
We have everything under control, Dad.

02:27.615 --> 02:28.733
I have to go.

02:28.734 --> 02:30.884
Um, and you can give my skis away.

02:30.885 --> 02:33.987
I honestly, don't know
where I'd put them.

02:36.331 --> 02:38.982
Hey, let me give you a hand.

02:38.983 --> 02:40.024
I got it.

02:40.025 --> 02:42.027
Oh, here.

02:42.753 --> 02:44.233
Hey, are you free tomorrow afternoon?

02:45.326 --> 02:47.352
Um...

02:47.353 --> 02:50.480
sorry, dude, my schedule's
booked pretty solid.

02:50.481 --> 02:52.649
That's too bad.

02:52.650 --> 02:54.910
I got a pretty good
opportunity coming up.

02:54.911 --> 02:57.879
But that's cool. I'll just ask Nina.

02:59.657 --> 03:01.699
Ask Nina what?

03:01.700 --> 03:04.953
I'm having a meet and greet
with some prospective parents,

03:04.954 --> 03:07.538
and I need a headliner.

03:07.539 --> 03:09.850
Yeah, I'm no good for that.

03:09.851 --> 03:11.000
I don't know if you heard,

03:11.001 --> 03:13.798
- but I am a little controversial.
- Mm.

03:13.799 --> 03:16.190
Those rich parents don't want
anything to do with me.

03:16.191 --> 03:18.065
You're selling yourself short, Rox.

03:19.101 --> 03:20.527
I think there is a way to spin this

03:20.528 --> 03:22.178
in the gym's favor.

03:22.179 --> 03:24.555
A whole new and improved Roxy Doyle.

03:24.556 --> 03:26.441
Roxy 2.0.

03:26.442 --> 03:28.117
What do you say?

03:29.728 --> 03:31.729
I don't know.

03:31.730 --> 03:34.749
You will, of course,
be well-compensated.

03:38.028 --> 03:39.529
Um...

03:41.365 --> 03:43.792
I mean, I guess I can
squeeze in an appearance.

03:43.793 --> 03:44.793
Thank you.

03:47.797 --> 03:50.465
Hey.

03:50.466 --> 03:52.133
Maybe think about wearing your hair down

03:52.134 --> 03:55.712
like you used to, in that braid.

03:55.713 --> 03:58.306
It's a good look for you.

04:03.762 --> 04:05.556
Your Honor, we have
made multiple requests

04:05.557 --> 04:08.040
for the prosecution to
include Dr. Bechley's laptop

04:08.041 --> 04:10.077
in discovery, but they refuse to engage.

04:10.078 --> 04:11.820
You mean, you didn't get
the answer you wanted.

04:11.821 --> 04:13.613
We estimate that we
have received printouts

04:13.614 --> 04:15.173
of less than a quarter
of the hard drive.

04:15.174 --> 04:17.348
We handed over all
relevant files, Your Honor.

04:17.349 --> 04:20.403
Okay, so pages three and five

04:20.404 --> 04:22.497
of Dr. Bechley's emails
with his medical supplier

04:22.498 --> 04:26.426
are relevant, but pages
one, two, and six are not?

04:26.427 --> 04:28.453
See, you do get it.

04:28.454 --> 04:30.955
Ms. Palmer, it is up to the prosecution

04:30.956 --> 04:33.253
to decide what to include in discovery.

04:33.254 --> 04:35.821
Are you arguing that
Ms. Doherty is abusing

04:35.822 --> 04:39.563
that discretion and engaging
in prosecutorial misconduct?

04:41.350 --> 04:43.810
Uh, I'm not... I'm not
necessarily suggesting

04:43.811 --> 04:45.101
such an escalation.

04:45.102 --> 04:48.956
Um... uh, it could be that, um...

04:48.957 --> 04:51.294
Your Honor, we are used to prosecutors

04:51.295 --> 04:54.312
curating discovery, but
what we are talking about

04:54.313 --> 04:56.623
is an egregious level
of censorship here.

04:56.624 --> 04:58.311
Why would they go to such lengths

04:58.312 --> 05:00.794
unless there was something
they did not want us to see?

05:00.795 --> 05:02.296
I understand your concern.

05:02.297 --> 05:05.563
So I will allow the
defense to view the laptop

05:05.564 --> 05:08.117
in the prosecutor's office,
under her supervision.

05:08.118 --> 05:10.453
With all due respect,
Your Honor, I can't have

05:10.454 --> 05:13.307
a parade of defense
attorneys in my office.

05:13.308 --> 05:15.444
Only Ms. Palmer, then.

05:15.445 --> 05:16.953
Can both sides live with this?

05:17.979 --> 05:19.387
Yes, Your Honor.

05:29.973 --> 05:31.733
♪ I'm a sucker for you ♪

05:33.352 --> 05:36.454
♪ Say the word and I'll
go anywhere blindly ♪

05:36.455 --> 05:37.670
Show-off.

05:37.671 --> 05:38.999
Just getting warmed up.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.658
It's the fifth frame.

05:40.659 --> 05:42.067
I really shine in the second half.

05:42.068 --> 05:43.844
That's like Olivia... you should
have seen her last weekend.

05:43.845 --> 05:44.903
It was family night.

05:44.904 --> 05:47.322
She managed to get
a gutter ball in the next lane.

05:47.323 --> 05:48.431
- Oh, my God.
- I'm sorry.

05:48.432 --> 05:51.126
I have a terrible habit of bringing
everything back to my kids.

05:51.127 --> 05:53.088
I like hearing about your kids.

05:53.089 --> 05:54.372
Ah, you're just being polite.

05:54.373 --> 05:56.666
No, I'm not. I like kids.

05:56.667 --> 05:59.353
Sometimes, I crash
kids' birthday parties,

05:59.354 --> 06:01.096
'cause I love a bouncy house.

06:01.097 --> 06:04.152
Yeah, believe me, I mean,
there's so much that's fun

06:04.153 --> 06:06.373
and amazing and they
are light of my life

06:06.374 --> 06:08.219
and the cream in my coffee, and also,

06:08.220 --> 06:11.556
it's like serving an
18-year jail sentence.

06:11.557 --> 06:14.033
Oh, that's pretty harsh.

06:14.034 --> 06:15.291
It is.

06:15.292 --> 06:17.946
It is harsh, especially
when you're doing it alone.

06:17.947 --> 06:20.189
It's, you know, all of your free time

06:20.190 --> 06:23.067
and interests just kind of
get swallowed up into theirs

06:23.068 --> 06:25.403
and until one day, you
find yourself, you know,

06:25.404 --> 06:27.017
standing the sideline of a soccer field

06:27.018 --> 06:29.124
on a Saturday morning,
holding a warm juice box,

06:29.125 --> 06:31.075
wondering if you ever
had a life of your own.

06:33.054 --> 06:35.296
But the good news is...

06:36.465 --> 06:37.748
You know, I started early.

06:37.749 --> 06:39.634
So another half dozen years

06:39.635 --> 06:40.918
and I'm paroled for good.

06:40.919 --> 06:42.062
Oh... oh, so you're done?

06:42.063 --> 06:43.880
You're... you're done having kids?

06:43.881 --> 06:46.757
Oh, yeah. I mean, I love 'em dearly.

06:46.758 --> 06:47.925
I'll be a mess when they go,

06:47.926 --> 06:50.311
but it'll also be kind of awesome,

06:50.312 --> 06:52.739
you know, to be able to
have fun like an adult again,

06:52.740 --> 06:54.891
to... I know this sounds crazy,

06:54.892 --> 06:56.317
but stay awake past 9:00.

06:56.318 --> 06:58.269
Yeah.

06:58.270 --> 07:00.247
That's not a problem for you, is it?

07:00.248 --> 07:01.623
'Cause on your dating profile...

07:01.624 --> 07:02.916
Oh, no, no!

07:02.917 --> 07:04.993
It's not a problem, not at all.

07:04.994 --> 07:06.736
- Okay.
- You're up.

07:06.737 --> 07:08.613
- Good.
- ♪ I'm a sucker for you ♪

07:12.784 --> 07:16.096
♪ I'm a sucker for you ♪

07:16.097 --> 07:18.840
I've read this sentence ten times.

07:18.841 --> 07:21.016
It makes no sense. Can you?

07:31.187 --> 07:33.304
- Who was that?
- The text?

07:33.305 --> 07:36.474
- Yeah.
- It's Julia.

07:39.329 --> 07:42.956
Edie, there's nothing
you couldn't tell me.

07:44.274 --> 07:46.609
- You know that.
- Yeah.

07:46.610 --> 07:50.154
There's nothing that I wouldn't
be able to forgive, except...

07:50.155 --> 07:51.305
Babe, we talked about this.

07:51.306 --> 07:53.824
- Can we just focus on work? We're...
- Being lied to.

07:53.825 --> 07:56.377
- That's the one thing...
- Babe, it's late.

07:56.378 --> 07:58.713
- We're both...
- You're hiding.

07:58.714 --> 08:00.215
You're hiding from me.

08:00.216 --> 08:03.501
I feel it. I can see it.

08:03.502 --> 08:05.002
You tell me that you're working,

08:05.003 --> 08:06.304
and then I catch you out with friends.

08:06.305 --> 08:07.829
That was one time, and I told you it was

08:07.830 --> 08:09.149
because I needed to blow off steam.

08:09.150 --> 08:11.884
Why'd you go easy on
Amanda in court today?

08:11.885 --> 08:13.844
- I didn't.
- You froze.

08:13.845 --> 08:17.014
You were about to rip into her
and then you just backed off.

08:17.015 --> 08:18.399
I wasn't confident in my argument.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.327
You weren't confident in your argument?

08:20.328 --> 08:21.686
Yeah.

08:21.687 --> 08:22.853
That's not the Edie I know.

08:22.854 --> 08:24.239
Well, I'm sorry.

08:24.240 --> 08:26.500
If there was something going on,

08:26.501 --> 08:29.318
something that you are not telling me...

08:29.319 --> 08:31.362
Babe, there's nothing going on.

08:31.363 --> 08:32.613
I promise.

08:32.614 --> 08:35.082
Everything in my life
has just been... it's been

08:35.083 --> 08:39.846
a little off center lately,
but my one north star is you.

08:42.152 --> 08:43.832
I swear.

08:54.889 --> 08:58.106
So how's it going with the teacher?

08:58.107 --> 09:01.442
Good. He's fun, easy to be around.

09:01.443 --> 09:04.228
I actually think I wanna see him again.

09:04.229 --> 09:06.063
But?

09:06.064 --> 09:08.283
But he doesn't want any more kids.

09:08.284 --> 09:09.859
I can't believe I'm talking about this.

09:09.860 --> 09:11.068
I just met the guy.

09:11.069 --> 09:13.046
Yeah, sounds pretty serious.

09:13.047 --> 09:14.905
It isn't, at all.

09:14.906 --> 09:16.574
We're still getting to know each other,

09:16.575 --> 09:19.035
but I've gotten to know that
he's done with having kids.

09:19.036 --> 09:20.579
So if it does get serious,

09:20.580 --> 09:21.921
that won't even be on the table.

09:21.922 --> 09:23.131
Yeah, you should probably
figure it out now.

09:23.132 --> 09:24.364
You don't wanna be ten years in

09:24.365 --> 09:26.250
and realize you want different things.

09:26.251 --> 09:29.503
Have you told Tim anything yet?

09:29.504 --> 09:30.755
Yeah.

09:30.756 --> 09:33.591
I looked him in his eyes, and I lied.

09:33.592 --> 09:37.219
- Mm.
- It was the most... I...

09:37.220 --> 09:38.738
it's like I'm out on a diving board,

09:38.739 --> 09:40.389
and I... I... I can't turn back,

09:40.390 --> 09:42.266
but I just... I'm not ready to jump.

09:42.267 --> 09:44.602
I don't know what to do.

09:44.603 --> 09:46.746
- 'Sup?
- Hey.

09:46.747 --> 09:49.082
Ooh, pancakes for the table, huh?

09:49.083 --> 09:50.617
You know those carbs will kill ya.

09:50.618 --> 09:52.493
Where you going dressed like that?

09:52.494 --> 09:54.904
Oh, I'm going to the gym,
have a little meet and greet,

09:54.905 --> 09:56.590
drum up some new business.

09:56.591 --> 09:58.057
You're doing appearances again?

09:58.058 --> 09:59.742
I thought you were just
focused on training Izzy.

09:59.743 --> 10:00.967
Oh, it's just a favor.

10:00.968 --> 10:03.171
Yeah, Nick needed me
to fill in last minute.

10:03.172 --> 10:06.507
Okay, what's the deal
with this Nick guy?

10:06.508 --> 10:08.260
What do you mean?

10:08.261 --> 10:09.960
How old were you when you dated him?

10:09.961 --> 10:11.179
Old enough.

10:11.180 --> 10:12.588
Did your parents know?

10:12.589 --> 10:14.441
It's not a big deal.

10:14.442 --> 10:15.633
But you were a minor.

10:15.634 --> 10:18.636
I was paying my parents' mortgage.

10:18.637 --> 10:19.861
I was basically an adult.

10:19.862 --> 10:21.522
Well, you might have felt like an adult,

10:21.523 --> 10:22.977
but you were still young and vulnerable.

10:22.978 --> 10:24.451
Okay, let me get this straight.

10:24.452 --> 10:27.028
So you go on two consecutive dates

10:27.029 --> 10:28.813
and you think you're
a relationship expert?

10:28.814 --> 10:30.314
- No.
- Oh, and you.

10:30.315 --> 10:32.149
You are sleeping with
our dad's prosecutor.

10:32.150 --> 10:33.460
Shh. Oh, my God.

10:33.461 --> 10:35.653
Roxy, I told you that in confidence.

10:35.654 --> 10:38.489
You need to back way up, okay?

10:38.490 --> 10:41.134
What happened with Nick
was a long time ago.

10:44.535 --> 10:46.664
Pass the syrup.

10:53.630 --> 10:55.456
Oh, hi. Hello.

10:55.457 --> 10:57.241
- Do you belong to someone?
- They're mine.

10:57.242 --> 10:59.176
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, it's okay.

10:59.177 --> 11:00.195
We're kid-friendly here.

11:00.196 --> 11:01.396
Do you need help with something?

11:01.397 --> 11:03.848
Uh, yeah, I should have called first,
but I had a spare moment

11:03.849 --> 11:05.900
and I didn't know when I'd get another.

11:05.901 --> 11:07.351
My name is Rivka Goldberg.

11:07.352 --> 11:08.662
I took one of your tests.

11:08.663 --> 11:11.989
It told me some surprising news.

11:13.483 --> 11:16.360
I'm Julia Bechley,
Leon Bechley's daughter.

11:18.488 --> 11:20.698
Then you're my sister.

11:22.159 --> 11:24.344
I always wanted a sister.

11:27.423 --> 11:30.832
The Torah commands us to
be fruitful and multiply.

11:30.833 --> 11:32.774
My parents had been
together for six years

11:32.775 --> 11:33.836
and still hadn't been blessed,

11:33.837 --> 11:35.522
so they secretly came here.

11:35.523 --> 11:38.549
Are fertility treatments
uncommon in your community?

11:38.550 --> 11:40.342
Between you and me,
they're not that uncommon.

11:40.343 --> 11:42.011
It's talking about them that's uncommon.

11:42.012 --> 11:44.364
Well, a lot of communities have a stigma

11:44.365 --> 11:46.032
around fertility treatments.

11:46.033 --> 11:48.350
You're lucky you have
two children already.

11:48.351 --> 11:50.060
And three more at home.

11:50.061 --> 11:51.896
You have five kids?

11:51.897 --> 11:53.189
How old are you?

11:53.190 --> 11:55.116
Sorry, you don't have to answer that.

11:55.117 --> 11:57.234
No, that's okay. I'm 28.

11:57.235 --> 11:58.712
I was blessed with my first at 20.

11:58.713 --> 12:01.030
- Oh, sorry.
- How many children do you have?

12:01.031 --> 12:03.958
Oh, none, uh, yet or ever.

12:03.959 --> 12:06.744
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.

12:06.745 --> 12:09.464
- You still have time.
- Thank you.

12:09.465 --> 12:11.766
Um, are you sure they
should be doing that?

12:11.767 --> 12:13.099
I don't want them to get hurt.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.292
Eh, it wouldn't be the first time today.

12:17.398 --> 12:20.049
Uh, Rivka, I-I want you
to know that we're here

12:20.050 --> 12:21.884
to provide any support you need,

12:21.885 --> 12:23.260
answer any questions that we can.

12:23.261 --> 12:25.429
Yes, I should probably
tell you why I'm here

12:25.430 --> 12:27.315
before my children destroy the place.

12:27.316 --> 12:29.150
I wanna know everything.

12:29.151 --> 12:31.214
About what my father did, right.

12:31.215 --> 12:32.820
No, about who you come from.

12:32.821 --> 12:35.231
I know all about the
family that raised me.

12:35.232 --> 12:37.791
Now I need to learn about
the family that created me.

12:38.902 --> 12:40.778
My faith is about honoring ancestors,

12:40.779 --> 12:43.089
keeping their stories
and traditions alive,

12:43.090 --> 12:44.924
not just the heroic ones, mind you,

12:44.925 --> 12:47.451
but the difficult ones as well.

12:47.452 --> 12:49.763
And your father's actions are

12:49.764 --> 12:52.748
certainly difficult to understand

12:52.749 --> 12:54.291
and accept.

12:54.292 --> 12:56.126
No argument there.

12:56.127 --> 12:57.678
But it still matters to me,

12:57.679 --> 13:00.330
to know about his people
and to talk about them

13:00.331 --> 13:01.516
to my children.

13:01.517 --> 13:03.777
So if there's anything you can share...

13:03.778 --> 13:04.852
I wish I could.

13:04.853 --> 13:06.946
Um, my family's very small...

13:06.947 --> 13:08.597
well, was very small.

13:08.598 --> 13:10.808
Um, and my father's always been

13:10.809 --> 13:13.861
pretty tight-lipped about
his past... our past.

13:13.862 --> 13:15.571
So you didn't grow up hearing stories

13:15.572 --> 13:16.939
about your relatives?

13:16.940 --> 13:19.033
I can't imagine that.
What'd you talk about?

13:19.034 --> 13:20.335
We found other things.

13:20.336 --> 13:21.768
Girls, don't rip the magazines.

13:21.769 --> 13:22.810
Oh, no, it's okay.

13:22.811 --> 13:24.113
We need new ones anyway.

13:25.615 --> 13:27.950
Um, well, I'll talk
to my dad and see what

13:27.951 --> 13:30.786
I can find out for you.

13:30.787 --> 13:32.960
- Thank you.
- Of course.

13:32.961 --> 13:35.003
All right. Up, up.

13:36.626 --> 13:40.629
Uh, can I ask, um...

13:40.630 --> 13:43.891
Do you ever feel like you missed out

13:43.892 --> 13:45.059
starting so young?

13:45.060 --> 13:46.261
Missed out on what?

13:46.262 --> 13:48.154
Having children is the
most meaningful thing

13:48.155 --> 13:49.446
a person can do with their life.

13:50.525 --> 13:54.327
All right, come on, you
little meshugenah monsters.

13:54.328 --> 13:57.725
Come on, baby. Okay, come on, you too.

13:57.726 --> 14:00.482
Let's go, go, go, go, go, go.

14:04.529 --> 14:06.822
Margaret has Lorenzo this weekend.

14:06.823 --> 14:08.966
Wanna sneak up to the Catskills?

14:10.252 --> 14:12.202
I can't.

14:12.203 --> 14:13.704
How about next weekend?

14:13.705 --> 14:16.332
I can ask if she'll swap days with me.

14:16.333 --> 14:18.851
It's beautiful up
there this time of year.

14:20.875 --> 14:22.333
It's really not a good time.

14:23.715 --> 14:25.774
Tim's starting to get suspicious.

14:27.886 --> 14:29.028
I'm sorry.

14:29.029 --> 14:31.555
That must be so stressful for you.

14:31.556 --> 14:33.740
But you know what might help?

14:36.019 --> 14:38.687
A weekend in the woods.

14:38.688 --> 14:40.965
You are relentless.

14:40.966 --> 14:43.213
You knew you were getting
involved with a married woman.

14:43.214 --> 14:45.819
I also know you said you
were falling in love with me.

14:45.820 --> 14:48.789
But that doesn't mean I'm
ready to detonate my marriage

14:48.790 --> 14:51.551
and hurt the person that's
been in my life for...

14:57.966 --> 15:00.542
Doherty.

15:00.543 --> 15:03.478
Oh. Yeah, I'll be right out.

15:04.473 --> 15:07.642
I have to go talk to my boss.

15:07.643 --> 15:08.900
You want me to wait out there?

15:08.901 --> 15:11.261
No, I'll be quick.

15:11.262 --> 15:12.813
Just think about it, okay?

15:12.814 --> 15:15.365
Okay.

16:02.642 --> 16:03.674
Mazel tov.

16:03.675 --> 16:06.442
You have an Orthodox daughter
and five grandchildren.

16:06.443 --> 16:08.152
Oh, did Rivka come into the clinic?

16:08.153 --> 16:11.205
Her parents wanted you
to use her father's DNA.

16:11.206 --> 16:12.990
Well, you know, they wanted a child,

16:12.991 --> 16:15.784
and their father's material
wasn't producing one.

16:15.785 --> 16:19.806
So I saw a way to give them
the outcome they desired.

16:19.807 --> 16:21.549
Well, that outcome would

16:21.550 --> 16:23.500
like to know about your family history,

16:23.501 --> 16:25.002
which is now her family history.

16:25.003 --> 16:27.004
And since you never
talk about your family,

16:27.005 --> 16:28.672
I didn't have anything to tell her.

16:28.673 --> 16:30.974
Well, I mean, you're
welcome to give her access

16:30.975 --> 16:32.226
to all my medical records.

16:32.227 --> 16:34.395
She wants stories, Dad,

16:34.396 --> 16:36.063
something to tell her children.

16:36.064 --> 16:38.567
Yeah, well, you know, I don't
see why that would be relevant.

16:38.568 --> 16:39.919
I mean, it never was to me.

16:39.920 --> 16:41.518
It is to her.

16:41.519 --> 16:43.536
I'm sure there are stories to share.

16:43.537 --> 16:45.395
Maybe while you're decluttering,

16:45.396 --> 16:47.672
you can find some.

16:51.913 --> 16:53.489
I'm waiting for someone.

16:53.490 --> 16:56.509
Is it cool if I sit while you wait?

17:06.336 --> 17:08.337
Plenty of open tables.

17:08.338 --> 17:11.098
Yeah, I was just thinking
it's time we had a chat.

17:11.098 --> 17:13.192
About what?

17:13.193 --> 17:15.511
Getting to know each other.

17:15.512 --> 17:17.271
I think it's very helpful to humanize

17:17.271 --> 17:18.655
the opposition in court.

17:19.981 --> 17:21.864
What do you wanna know?

17:21.865 --> 17:23.339
The basics.

17:24.395 --> 17:25.854
You married?

17:25.855 --> 17:27.396
Divorced.

17:27.397 --> 17:29.283
- Kids?
- One.

17:29.284 --> 17:32.045
Where'd you grow up?

17:32.046 --> 17:33.954
Look, I appreciate what
you're trying to do here,

17:33.955 --> 17:37.199
but it's not my style to
cozy up to my adversaries.

17:37.200 --> 17:39.460
That's good to know.

17:39.461 --> 17:41.721
I really am waiting for someone.

17:41.722 --> 17:43.747
I was in your shoes once.

17:43.748 --> 17:46.133
What are you talking about?

17:46.134 --> 17:47.635
So in law school...

17:49.254 --> 17:52.481
I went against Edie in mock trial.

17:53.351 --> 17:56.060
Sparring with her was intoxicating.

17:56.061 --> 17:58.684
She's focuses in on you
like you're the only person

17:58.685 --> 18:00.764
in the whole world who matters.

18:00.765 --> 18:04.151
I thought we were falling in love.

18:04.152 --> 18:07.396
But when it was over, she shook my hand

18:07.397 --> 18:11.108
and that look in her eye...

18:11.109 --> 18:13.327
was gone.

18:13.328 --> 18:14.921
Well, now you're married,

18:14.922 --> 18:17.364
couldn't have been a total wash.

18:17.365 --> 18:20.167
She knew I had a crush on her.

18:20.168 --> 18:22.002
She was taking advantage of me.

18:22.003 --> 18:24.246
Edie will do anything if she thinks

18:24.247 --> 18:26.340
it'll help her win.

18:26.341 --> 18:29.418
So you better watch
your back, prosecutor.

18:31.605 --> 18:33.639
Are you a beer person?

18:33.640 --> 18:36.091
'Cause I was thinking
about getting a pitcher.

18:36.092 --> 18:38.135
Uh...

18:38.136 --> 18:39.970
I want kids.

18:39.971 --> 18:43.691
Not right now, someday...
maybe. I don't know.

18:43.692 --> 18:48.437
Um, but I want at least the possibility.

18:48.438 --> 18:51.607
Okay, yeah, it's, uh...

18:51.608 --> 18:53.200
we're having that conversation.

18:53.201 --> 18:55.068
Sorry, I know I didn't
put it on my profile,

18:55.069 --> 18:57.946
so I'm just... I just
wanna get it out there.

18:57.947 --> 18:59.455
I think because of my work,

18:59.456 --> 19:02.755
I always felt like I was this godmother

19:02.756 --> 19:04.590
to all these little babies
that I brought into the world,

19:04.591 --> 19:06.046
and I thought that would be enough.

19:06.047 --> 19:07.831
But then when you said
that you didn't wanna

19:07.832 --> 19:11.098
have any more kids, I got
this pit in my stomach.

19:11.099 --> 19:13.492
And I also have a lot of stuff going on

19:13.493 --> 19:16.103
with my family right now,
and it's making me rethink a lot.

19:17.985 --> 19:19.924
This is crazy. Sorry.

19:19.925 --> 19:21.729
No, it's not crazy.

19:21.730 --> 19:23.564
I don't even know how
to spell your last name.

19:23.565 --> 19:25.349
I think there's a silent H.

19:25.350 --> 19:27.675
- No H.
- Huh.

19:27.676 --> 19:30.312
Um, well, I just wanted
to get it off my chest

19:30.313 --> 19:34.167
before I started spinning
out and ruin our date.

19:34.168 --> 19:36.002
I appreciate your honesty.

19:36.003 --> 19:38.337
I understand if you
wanna run out of here.

19:38.338 --> 19:40.088
That's your game, not mine.

19:41.991 --> 19:43.009
I like you.

19:43.010 --> 19:44.493
I wanna spend more time with you.

19:44.494 --> 19:46.036
We can totally talk about it.

19:46.037 --> 19:49.371
I also just had, like, a
really tough day at work,

19:49.372 --> 19:50.516
and I'm kinda dying to order some beer.

19:50.517 --> 19:53.427
Oh, pfft. Yeah, let's do that.

19:53.428 --> 19:55.429
Just ignore me. Uh, I'm sorry.

19:55.430 --> 19:57.381
Let's just keep things light and fun,

19:57.382 --> 19:58.766
because that's my jam.

20:02.029 --> 20:04.221
Decent?

20:04.222 --> 20:05.606
Yeah.

20:08.413 --> 20:10.018
Not to rush you or anything,

20:10.019 --> 20:11.186
but people will be here any minute.

20:11.187 --> 20:13.846
Yeah, I know. I'm almost ready. Ow.

20:13.847 --> 20:16.490
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

20:19.287 --> 20:21.129
Where's the...

20:21.916 --> 20:23.591
All right, you know you can't lie to me.

20:23.592 --> 20:25.217
What's wrong?

20:27.726 --> 20:29.559
Heh.

20:34.898 --> 20:37.805
Do you think people will be disappointed
that it's me and not Nina?

20:37.806 --> 20:39.747
Nina is nobody.

20:39.748 --> 20:41.273
Nina has a gold medal.

20:41.274 --> 20:42.665
So?

20:44.887 --> 20:47.389
All right, but if the
parents don't go for this,

20:47.390 --> 20:50.100
remember this was
your idea and not mine.

20:51.245 --> 20:53.395
Listen, Nina had
technique and discipline.

20:53.396 --> 20:55.564
I'll give her that.

20:55.565 --> 20:57.825
But you have what can't be taught

20:57.826 --> 21:01.120
and everybody sees it:

21:01.121 --> 21:05.666
that spark, instinct, musicality.

21:05.667 --> 21:08.452
You are a star, Roxy.

21:11.080 --> 21:13.674
You really believe that?

21:17.187 --> 21:18.962
You are here and she's not.

21:22.925 --> 21:26.094
Let's go lighter on that lipstick.

21:26.095 --> 21:27.779
Going for a classy vibe.

21:28.782 --> 21:30.283
I'll see you out there in five.

21:30.284 --> 21:31.859
Okay.

21:46.875 --> 21:49.543
- Dad.
- What in God's name...

21:49.544 --> 21:50.611
What are you doing here?

21:50.612 --> 21:52.880
Why are there smiley faces
on the sign-in sheet?

21:52.881 --> 21:54.281
They're not all smiling.

21:54.282 --> 21:55.474
- They... they're...
- That one is sad.

21:55.475 --> 21:56.625
That one is anxious.

21:56.626 --> 21:58.552
- This one's smiling.
- Barely.

21:58.553 --> 22:00.888
You circle the one that
best represents how you feel

22:00.889 --> 22:03.149
so the staff can
calibrate their approach.

22:03.150 --> 22:04.174
I don't understand.

22:04.175 --> 22:05.801
Are we running a medical clinic

22:05.802 --> 22:07.561
or a preschool?

22:07.562 --> 22:09.563
You're not supposed to be here.

22:09.564 --> 22:11.448
Well, you asked for our family history.

22:11.449 --> 22:13.067
You could have brought
that to my apartment.

22:13.068 --> 22:14.935
Okay, well, now that I'm here,

22:14.936 --> 22:16.979
how 'bout you give me a VIP tour

22:16.980 --> 22:18.947
of all these changes you've made.

22:18.948 --> 22:21.284
I see you got new magazines. Wellness.

22:21.285 --> 22:24.170
What's Wellness?
It's medicine, not wellness.

22:24.171 --> 22:26.363
- And what are those chairs?
- They're womb chairs.

22:26.364 --> 22:28.507
They're very soothing
and extremely comfortable.

22:28.508 --> 22:31.284
- How much did they cost?
- More than the yoga balls.

22:31.285 --> 22:32.652
The yoga balls?

22:32.653 --> 22:34.244
It focuses your attention on the body.

22:34.245 --> 22:35.872
It's very grounding and tons of fun.

22:35.873 --> 22:36.924
- Tons of what?
- Fun.

22:36.925 --> 22:39.376
Oh, wha... Jan!

22:39.377 --> 22:41.002
Ha. What a sight for sore eyes.

22:41.003 --> 22:44.523
- How are ya?
- I'm... I'm sorry,

22:44.524 --> 22:49.177
I have to... nice seeing
you, uh, Dr. Bechley.

22:49.178 --> 22:51.105
Well, let's take a look
at your office, shall we?

22:51.106 --> 22:53.682
Okay, it's a work in progress.

22:55.369 --> 22:57.036
Huh.

22:57.037 --> 23:01.231
_

23:01.232 --> 23:04.234
Eh. Huh.

23:04.235 --> 23:07.237
Oh, you still have my pencil holder.

23:07.238 --> 23:09.715
- Should I take it with me...
- No, I like it.

23:09.716 --> 23:11.366
Dad, I know this is hard for you,

23:11.367 --> 23:14.911
but I'm the one keeping
us in business, barely.

23:14.912 --> 23:17.205
Yeah. I shouldn't be here.

23:17.206 --> 23:19.974
I should go. Here.

23:21.007 --> 23:22.665
This is a bunch of
dates and birthplaces.

23:22.666 --> 23:24.546
Look, it's information,
data. I thought you...

23:24.547 --> 23:26.723
I could have gotten this from
a genealogy website myself.

23:26.724 --> 23:29.259
Well, it's all I have to
offer other than my apologies.

23:29.260 --> 23:32.481
Dad, you took away her
connection to her ancestors.

23:32.482 --> 23:34.389
You completely destabilized her,

23:34.390 --> 23:39.060
and all she wants in return
are just some stories, details.

23:39.061 --> 23:40.628
Why can't you just share them?

23:40.629 --> 23:42.476
Why don't you ever wanna
talk about your family?

23:42.477 --> 23:44.324
Because I don't, okay?

23:44.325 --> 23:46.276
I know this doesn't matter to you,

23:46.277 --> 23:49.422
but did you ever consider
that it might matter to me?

23:49.423 --> 23:53.450
She's lucky to have the family she does.

23:53.451 --> 23:55.911
It's better not to know.

24:10.852 --> 24:13.112
- What's the emergency?
- Sit.

24:25.149 --> 24:26.533
What am I looking at?

24:26.534 --> 24:30.320
I accidentally read Amanda's email.

24:30.321 --> 24:32.539
She left it open on her computer

24:32.540 --> 24:34.300
when I was in her office.

24:34.301 --> 24:35.967
- For work.
- Okay.

24:37.028 --> 24:38.904
"No warrant". What does this mean?

24:38.905 --> 24:41.164
When you turned in the laptop,
the cops were supposed to get

24:41.165 --> 24:42.582
a warrant before they opened it.

24:42.583 --> 24:43.976
Otherwise, it's an illegal search.

24:43.977 --> 24:45.961
And they didn't get a warrant?

24:45.962 --> 24:47.737
I talked to my contact at the precinct,

24:47.738 --> 24:48.964
apparently, they jumped the gun.

24:48.965 --> 24:51.892
They didn't know what
they had until it was too late.

24:51.893 --> 24:53.677
- So this is a good thing.
- Yeah.

24:53.678 --> 24:54.970
It's good for the case,

24:54.971 --> 24:57.847
but it's bad for me and Amanda.

24:57.848 --> 25:00.993
- Edie...
- I know. I took pictures of her email.

25:00.994 --> 25:02.828
If I blindside her in court with this,

25:02.829 --> 25:04.538
she's never gonna trust me ever again.

25:04.539 --> 25:07.081
Well, I hate to say this, but...

25:07.082 --> 25:08.858
This is why you're not
supposed to date the prosecutor.

25:08.859 --> 25:10.193
I know. I get it.

25:10.194 --> 25:12.079
And Tim knows something's going on.

25:12.080 --> 25:15.365
When he looked at me like...
if I told him the truth,

25:15.366 --> 25:16.992
it would destroy him.

25:16.993 --> 25:18.844
Well, the longer that you hide this...

25:18.845 --> 25:19.920
I know. I know.

25:19.921 --> 25:21.421
Look, I'm here to support you

25:21.422 --> 25:23.223
no matter what you choose.

25:24.242 --> 25:26.835
But you have to make a decision.

25:33.949 --> 25:35.365
Hello, Doctor.

25:37.030 --> 25:38.939
- Hey.
- Hi there.

25:38.940 --> 25:41.349
Check your texts. You free for lunch?

25:41.350 --> 25:44.728
Uh, sorry, I can't. I'm buried.

25:44.729 --> 25:46.563
Okay, I get it.

25:46.564 --> 25:50.042
You work, I work. I am also busy.

25:50.043 --> 25:52.120
- You are?
- Yeah.

25:52.121 --> 25:54.062
I had Nick's meet and
greet at the gym yesterday.

25:54.063 --> 25:55.521
He said I was amazing.

25:55.522 --> 25:57.550
I had those parents eating
out of the palm of my hand.

25:57.551 --> 25:59.200
What about Izzy?

25:59.201 --> 26:01.745
What about Izzy? I'm still her coach.

26:01.746 --> 26:03.722
How much did Nick pay you?

26:03.723 --> 26:05.540
It's not important.

26:05.541 --> 26:08.393
So is this gonna be
a regular thing or...

26:09.788 --> 26:12.422
I don't know, man. What's
with all the questions?

26:12.423 --> 26:13.966
Feel like I'm at the doctor's office.

26:13.967 --> 26:16.259
I mean, I am at the doctor's office...

26:16.260 --> 26:17.335
you know what I mean.

26:17.336 --> 26:19.220
I-I'm just curious.

26:21.557 --> 26:23.409
Okay.

26:25.153 --> 26:27.495
I see what this is. You want the real.

26:31.918 --> 26:33.327
Nick and I used to date,

26:33.328 --> 26:35.588
but it was over ten years ago

26:35.589 --> 26:37.906
and it's all in the rearview

26:37.907 --> 26:40.593
and now it is strictly profesh.

26:40.594 --> 26:42.502
"Over ten years ago".

26:42.503 --> 26:46.765
That would have made
you, what, 18 or younger?

26:52.755 --> 26:54.815
I don't need your
permission to go to my job,

26:54.816 --> 26:56.016
and if you can't trust me,

26:56.017 --> 26:59.427
- then I don't know what I'm doing here.
- That's not what I'm saying.

26:59.428 --> 27:02.597
I'm trying to make sure this guy
doesn't take advantage of you.

27:04.117 --> 27:06.476
So I couldn't possibly be
an asset to his business?

27:06.477 --> 27:08.195
- No, he has to want something...
- Okay, calm down.

27:08.196 --> 27:09.788
Don't tell me to calm down.

27:09.789 --> 27:11.031
What are you saying?

27:11.032 --> 27:13.533
Roxy, I'm looking out for you here.

27:13.534 --> 27:15.461
No, you're not. Here.

27:15.462 --> 27:18.321
Why don't you worry
about your patients, okay?

27:18.322 --> 27:19.632
Because I'm fine.

27:34.360 --> 27:36.126
Julia?

27:36.127 --> 27:38.261
Yeah.

27:42.697 --> 27:45.565
Did I tell you I ran into Amanda?

27:45.566 --> 27:46.975
No. Where?

27:46.976 --> 27:48.685
Outside the courthouse.

27:48.686 --> 27:49.995
We had a nice chat.

27:49.996 --> 27:51.997
Oh, wha... uh, what about?

27:51.998 --> 27:54.190
The case.

27:54.191 --> 27:55.191
You.

27:57.170 --> 27:59.004
What about me?

27:59.005 --> 28:00.530
Just what a great lawyer you are.

28:00.531 --> 28:02.082
Oh.

28:02.083 --> 28:05.160
Honestly...

28:05.161 --> 28:06.345
I thought I'd hate her.

28:06.346 --> 28:08.163
She's pretty cool.

28:09.832 --> 28:12.091
Yeah, she's... she's pretty cool.

28:15.319 --> 28:17.034
But she's still a prosecutor.

28:17.035 --> 28:18.802
What's this?

28:20.084 --> 28:23.103
I saw it on her laptop
when I was in her office.

28:23.104 --> 28:24.679
You took a picture of her email?

28:24.680 --> 28:26.389
She left it open.

28:26.390 --> 28:30.076
Babe, you are ruthless.

28:31.112 --> 28:34.205
I'm just doing my job.

28:36.066 --> 28:37.784
Do you know how lucky I feel?

28:39.570 --> 28:41.213
This life that we've built together

28:41.214 --> 28:43.031
means everything to me.

28:44.241 --> 28:47.461
You mean everything to me.

28:47.462 --> 28:49.204
And I know I don't say it enough.

28:49.205 --> 28:50.255
I'm sorry.

28:52.392 --> 28:56.252
But I need to, 'cause
you deserve to hear it.

29:22.663 --> 29:24.030
Hello.

29:24.031 --> 29:26.091
This is not an apology.

29:26.092 --> 29:28.176
- Okay.
- It's an explanation.

29:29.431 --> 29:31.565
Every year, my mother
would tell this story

29:31.566 --> 29:35.267
on my birthday, about
the day I was born.

29:35.268 --> 29:37.344
I was eight weeks premature,

29:37.345 --> 29:40.797
the size of an above-average hamster.

29:40.798 --> 29:43.591
And when I arrived, well,
it was the same week

29:43.592 --> 29:45.852
she was supposed to
defend her graduate thesis

29:45.853 --> 29:47.428
in mathematics.

29:47.429 --> 29:49.782
The experience was so traumatic for her,

29:49.783 --> 29:54.243
that she never regained her footing.

29:55.622 --> 29:58.664
My birth was the death of her career.

30:00.034 --> 30:02.944
And every year, she would put
another candle on the cake,

30:02.945 --> 30:04.654
tell me the story

30:04.655 --> 30:06.632
so that I didn't forget it.

30:06.633 --> 30:09.550
Dad, that's terrible.

30:11.137 --> 30:12.137
I didn't know that.

30:12.138 --> 30:14.831
I-I always thought she was

30:14.832 --> 30:17.309
the sweet old lady
with mints in her purse.

30:17.310 --> 30:19.460
Well, you didn't have to know.

30:19.461 --> 30:23.056
I always tried to make you feel wanted,

30:23.057 --> 30:26.893
to bring you into my life
and not push you away.

30:26.894 --> 30:30.322
You did. You always did.

30:30.323 --> 30:33.516
This is why I don't tell
stories about my family,

30:33.517 --> 30:37.620
because it just stirs things up.

30:38.814 --> 30:43.168
Dad, um, Rivka invited
us over to her house

30:43.169 --> 30:45.194
for Shabbat.

30:45.195 --> 30:47.339
I think it would be good if you went.

30:47.340 --> 30:48.582
I don't know.

30:48.583 --> 30:50.033
That's a very nice invitation,

30:50.034 --> 30:51.326
but I don't know.

30:52.920 --> 30:56.014
She's searching for a
connection to her roots.

30:56.015 --> 30:58.499
You're a part of that.

30:58.500 --> 30:59.940
You don't have to tell her anything.

31:00.912 --> 31:04.523
But I think if you just showed up,

31:04.524 --> 31:06.433
it would be meaningful.

31:13.032 --> 31:14.608
Yes, queen!

31:14.609 --> 31:16.392
I can't believe I landed that.

31:16.393 --> 31:17.703
See? I told you.

31:17.704 --> 31:19.395
Okay, next time, turn over your roundoff

31:19.396 --> 31:20.746
a little faster, okay?

31:21.782 --> 31:23.624
Actually, Izzy, go take a water break.

31:24.619 --> 31:27.362
- We are still a good team.
- Yeah?

31:27.363 --> 31:29.381
Every parent that came
to that meet and greet

31:29.382 --> 31:31.049
signed up at least one kid.

31:31.050 --> 31:32.758
Sweet.

31:33.887 --> 31:36.054
Now we have a new problem, though.

31:36.055 --> 31:37.180
What's that?

31:37.181 --> 31:38.706
Well, those parents are
gonna be disappointed

31:38.707 --> 31:42.394
when they realize it's not
you training their kid.

31:42.395 --> 31:45.421
Unless, of course, you
wanna be a coach here.

31:47.424 --> 31:49.926
Are you offering me a full-time job,

31:49.927 --> 31:51.478
like, with benefits?

31:51.479 --> 31:53.429
'Cause I'm kind of my
own dentist right now.

31:53.430 --> 31:56.057
Yeah, full-time, full benefits.

31:56.058 --> 31:57.433
Can I still train Izzy?

31:57.434 --> 32:00.103
Of course, as long as it doesn't
interfere with the rec students.

32:00.104 --> 32:01.437
Yeah, no, it won't.

32:01.438 --> 32:04.658
Then... welcome back?

32:04.659 --> 32:07.110
Thank you.

32:07.111 --> 32:08.587
I won't let you down.

32:08.588 --> 32:11.547
Hey, you might wanna
rethink those sweatpants.

32:12.408 --> 32:14.283
Gotta look the part, right?

32:14.284 --> 32:16.411
What's his problem with sweatpants?

32:16.412 --> 32:18.246
Um, he just doesn't like 'em.

32:18.247 --> 32:20.173
Why do you care what he thinks?

32:20.174 --> 32:21.791
I don't.

32:21.792 --> 32:25.178
Hey, who told you to
stop? Go do another pass.

32:25.179 --> 32:28.089
Come on, hustle.

33:00.382 --> 33:03.450
See, now this is part a part
of the city I can get behind.

33:03.451 --> 33:05.552
I come here when I need peace and quiet.

33:07.146 --> 33:10.147
Mm, nature.

33:11.726 --> 33:13.893
Smooth.

33:13.894 --> 33:15.988
It's right over here. That's my spot.

33:15.989 --> 33:18.072
I'm honored.

33:20.067 --> 33:21.660
- Sarah was my mom.
- _

33:21.661 --> 33:25.521
And I come here to talk to her.

33:25.522 --> 33:27.857
Aw. I'm sorry.

33:27.858 --> 33:30.076
We don't have to talk about this.

33:30.077 --> 33:32.461
I'm a widower. Death is my comfort zone.

33:34.323 --> 33:36.048
Tell me about Sarah.

33:39.661 --> 33:42.205
Well, we actually used to sit here

33:42.206 --> 33:43.682
when I was a kid.

33:43.683 --> 33:46.852
And I would just tell
her what was going on;

33:46.853 --> 33:50.430
boy stuff, girls being
mean to me, whatever.

33:50.431 --> 33:53.174
And sometimes, she
wouldn't even say anything.

33:53.175 --> 33:55.860
She would just be here.

33:57.387 --> 33:59.071
She always made me feel safe.

34:00.557 --> 34:02.200
And I know that you already know this,

34:02.201 --> 34:06.371
but I have a tendency to
spin out and so sometimes,

34:06.372 --> 34:10.623
I come here and I feel better.

34:12.045 --> 34:13.085
I really miss her.

34:14.380 --> 34:16.005
I know the feeling.

34:17.866 --> 34:20.076
How long has it been since...

34:20.077 --> 34:22.036
Four years.

34:22.036 --> 34:25.724
Six weeks after she was
diagnosed with colon cancer.

34:25.725 --> 34:30.585
We were still processing the news...

34:30.587 --> 34:32.730
planning treatment and she was gone.

34:33.641 --> 34:35.232
Wow. I'm sorry.

34:36.217 --> 34:38.219
You thought that you were
bad at keeping it light?

34:38.219 --> 34:41.097
I just brought up death from
colon cancer on a third date.

34:41.098 --> 34:43.532
We're quite the pair.

34:44.744 --> 34:46.034
Tell me about her.

34:48.938 --> 34:50.289
We were college sweethearts.

34:51.309 --> 34:54.661
Um, she was unlike anyone I've ever met.

34:54.661 --> 34:58.281
She loved children's
books and horror movies.

34:58.282 --> 35:00.908
She was fluent in French.

35:00.909 --> 35:04.096
The back of my garage
is filled with boxes

35:04.097 --> 35:05.338
of things we were collecting

35:05.339 --> 35:06.673
for a bakery she wanted to open.

35:06.674 --> 35:07.957
And she was a terrible baker.

35:07.958 --> 35:09.175
It was never gonna happen,

35:09.176 --> 35:11.460
but she had confidence.

35:11.461 --> 35:13.187
She sounds really special.

35:14.849 --> 35:16.775
She was.

35:16.776 --> 35:20.928
She definitely was, and for a long time,

35:20.929 --> 35:22.423
I didn't think I would
be able to see my way

35:22.424 --> 35:24.783
to caring about anyone else,

35:24.784 --> 35:28.787
but life has a way of surprising you.

35:50.334 --> 35:52.552
Are you ready?

35:52.553 --> 35:54.174
Ms. Palmer, you have something

35:54.175 --> 35:56.297
you'd like to present to the court?

35:56.298 --> 35:57.340
Yes, Your Honor.

35:57.341 --> 35:58.841
It has come to my attention

35:58.842 --> 36:00.652
that the police did not have a warrant

36:00.653 --> 36:02.511
when they searched Dr. Bechley's laptop.

36:03.564 --> 36:04.805
May I approach?

36:13.532 --> 36:16.168
Why do you have pictures
of the prosecution's email?

36:16.169 --> 36:18.694
It was open on her
computer when I was in her office.

36:18.695 --> 36:19.916
Page four is an affidavit

36:19.917 --> 36:21.246
from the police chief confirming

36:21.247 --> 36:23.508
that they in fact did
not have a warrant.

36:24.677 --> 36:27.846
Ms. Doherty, were you planning
to disclose this information?

36:27.847 --> 36:30.089
Before I did that, I
wanted to research...

36:30.090 --> 36:32.208
Yes or no?

36:32.209 --> 36:33.852
No.

36:33.853 --> 36:37.371
Ms. Doherty, prosecutors
do not run the show

36:37.372 --> 36:38.431
in my courtroom.

36:38.432 --> 36:40.883
The laptop is excluded from trial.

36:40.884 --> 36:43.177
We're adjourned for the time being.

36:43.178 --> 36:46.389
Ms. Doherty, please see me in chambers.

36:47.849 --> 36:49.442
We got her.

36:57.101 --> 36:59.711
I'm taking you to dinner.
We're celebrating.

37:18.231 --> 37:20.788
Hey, so I can't believe
you've been married

37:20.789 --> 37:22.550
since you were, like, 19.

37:22.551 --> 37:24.069
- Roxy.
- It's okay.

37:24.070 --> 37:26.053
- I know it's unusual.
- How'd you guys meet?

37:26.054 --> 37:29.023
Uh, my parents and I
met several young men

37:29.024 --> 37:31.100
and their families to
see if we were compatible.

37:31.101 --> 37:33.060
I picked Yehuda, and he picked me.

37:33.061 --> 37:34.770
What was it about him?

37:34.771 --> 37:37.732
- He made me laugh.
- That was it?

37:37.733 --> 37:39.900
That was enough.

37:39.901 --> 37:41.110
That's insane.

37:41.111 --> 37:42.829
I knew the important things.

37:42.830 --> 37:45.906
He was kind. We wanted lots of children.

37:45.907 --> 37:47.616
We had the same Jewish values.

37:47.617 --> 37:49.618
Yeah, but was there a spark?

37:49.619 --> 37:51.245
No.

37:51.246 --> 37:53.706
- Not even a little?
- I was terrified.

37:53.707 --> 37:56.009
I'd never even touched a
boy before my wedding night.

37:56.010 --> 37:59.795
Yeah, but how did you know
you were, you know, compatible?

37:59.796 --> 38:03.257
You work at it. Doesn't everybody?

38:03.258 --> 38:07.687
- Reverse, reverse.
- Reverse, reverse.

38:07.688 --> 38:09.472
All right, high-five time.

38:09.473 --> 38:10.690
Let's go.

38:10.691 --> 38:14.268
One, two, three, four, five.

38:14.269 --> 38:15.736
And then we go...

38:15.737 --> 38:17.605
Ooh!

38:17.606 --> 38:19.607
Man down. Save him.

38:19.608 --> 38:21.442
Hey, Rox?

38:21.443 --> 38:25.262
Why don't you take some of these
to the guys out there for me?

38:25.263 --> 38:26.706
Because I'm stirring the soup?

38:26.707 --> 38:28.449
Please.

38:31.995 --> 38:35.214
You know, you're a little bossy.

38:35.215 --> 38:37.475
I know. Thank you.

38:40.146 --> 38:43.890
♪ L'hadlik ner, l'hadlik ner ♪

38:43.891 --> 38:47.192
♪ Shel shabbos ♪

38:48.212 --> 38:50.513
- Good Shabbos.
- Good Shabbos.

38:50.514 --> 38:53.015
Good Shabbos.

38:53.016 --> 38:54.809
- Mm-hmm.
- Shabbos.

38:54.810 --> 38:56.639
- Good Shabbos.
- Can we eat now?

38:56.640 --> 38:59.405
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

38:59.406 --> 39:01.357
Give me!

39:01.358 --> 39:03.526
Oh, more siblings.

39:03.527 --> 39:05.836
Probably.

39:10.700 --> 39:12.535
You must be Rivka.

39:12.536 --> 39:14.921
Good Shabbos.

39:18.926 --> 39:20.426
Oh, um...

39:34.367 --> 39:35.850
Ah.

39:35.851 --> 39:37.869
Here, this is my mother,
Claudia Bechley.

39:39.521 --> 39:41.706
Hey, you think we have the same nose?

39:41.707 --> 39:43.449
No.

39:45.285 --> 39:46.569
Okay.

39:46.570 --> 39:47.903
So when I was six years old,

39:47.904 --> 39:50.072
a man came to our door, right?

39:50.073 --> 39:51.716
And, uh, he needed signatures

39:51.717 --> 39:54.261
so that he could be on
the ballot for Congress.

39:55.721 --> 39:57.204
And so the man, he did his spiel,

39:57.205 --> 40:00.666
and my mother thought
that it sounded fine enough

40:00.667 --> 40:03.803
to put her signature on his petition,

40:03.804 --> 40:05.563
took a pamphlet, and
sent him on his way.

40:05.564 --> 40:09.976
And after he left, she
read the pamphlet, right?

40:09.977 --> 40:13.071
And her face turned beet red.

40:13.072 --> 40:15.222
Because this man, turns out, was against

40:15.223 --> 40:16.741
the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

40:16.742 --> 40:18.301
Do you know what that is?

40:18.302 --> 40:22.393
Okay, so that law makes it
illegal to take things away

40:22.394 --> 40:25.232
from a person just because
of their race or religion.

40:25.233 --> 40:27.618
Very important law, and this man,

40:27.619 --> 40:29.445
he just... he wanted to get rid of it.

40:29.446 --> 40:31.330
So my mother and I, we got into a cab.

40:31.331 --> 40:32.948
We drove all over the Upper West Side

40:32.949 --> 40:34.398
until we found the man

40:34.399 --> 40:35.436
so that my mother could tell him

40:35.437 --> 40:36.911
to take her name off of the petition.

40:36.912 --> 40:39.455
Oh. She sounds like a strong woman.

40:39.456 --> 40:41.174
Oh, yeah, she was.

40:41.175 --> 40:43.292
Yeah, you can tell your
daughters that they come

40:43.293 --> 40:45.961
from a long line of very
smart, very strong women,

40:45.962 --> 40:49.015
who also, by the way, were very good

40:49.016 --> 40:51.851
at being patient with
the men in their lives.

40:53.937 --> 40:55.870
What else we have here?

41:02.031 --> 41:06.032
That's my father, Ernest.
He was in the ad business.

41:08.151 --> 41:09.985
And who's that?

41:09.986 --> 41:11.463
Dinner was so good.

41:11.464 --> 41:12.538
Thanks for having us.

41:12.539 --> 41:13.989
Oh, yeah.

41:13.990 --> 41:16.158
Hey, Julia, wasn't dinner so good?

41:16.159 --> 41:18.044
Everything was great. Thank you.

41:18.045 --> 41:19.304
What was the meat again?

41:19.305 --> 41:20.972
- Chicken.
- What color's your dress?

41:20.973 --> 41:22.623
- Blue.
- Do you want kids?

41:22.624 --> 41:23.975
Yes... no. I don't know.

41:23.976 --> 41:25.310
Ha!

41:25.311 --> 41:27.479
That's not fair! I wasn't thinking.

41:27.480 --> 41:29.647
Yeah, that's the whole point
of the speed question game.

41:29.648 --> 41:30.890
You got played, sis.

41:30.891 --> 41:31.932
What's going on?

41:31.933 --> 41:33.459
Julia's dating a guy who doesn't know

41:33.460 --> 41:34.819
if he wants kids, and she doesn't know

41:34.820 --> 41:36.428
- how she feels about it.
- Well, I think we just found out

41:36.429 --> 41:37.512
how she feels about it.

41:37.513 --> 41:38.990
I don't even know if I want kids,

41:38.991 --> 41:40.182
and it doesn't matter,

41:40.183 --> 41:41.476
because we're keeping it casual.

41:41.477 --> 41:42.994
Doesn't sound casual to me.

41:42.995 --> 41:45.468
Ooh, just diving right in there,
aren't you, Rivka?

41:45.469 --> 41:47.999
- We've only been on three dates.
- That doesn't mean anything.

41:48.000 --> 41:50.601
I married Yehuda six
weeks after I met him.

41:50.602 --> 41:52.419
I should probably talk
to him, shouldn't I?

41:52.420 --> 41:55.061
Sooner the better,
before anyone gets hurt.

41:55.062 --> 41:57.954
Ooh, yeah, you should
text him, like, right now.

41:57.955 --> 41:59.844
No, it should be an
in-person conversation.

41:59.845 --> 42:01.087
No, too scary.

42:01.088 --> 42:03.014
I'm going with Roxy on this one.

42:03.015 --> 42:04.840
- Okay, what should I say?
- Not in here!

42:04.841 --> 42:06.924
You do not use technology on Shabbat.

42:08.169 --> 42:10.504
I went to JCC camp when I was a kid.

42:12.525 --> 42:13.858
Okay.

42:13.859 --> 42:16.218
"Hey, Donovan, I've been thinking"...

42:16.219 --> 42:17.830
Mm, no. Nothing good ever comes

42:17.831 --> 42:19.197
- after "I've been thinking".
- Yeah.

42:19.198 --> 42:20.889
Yeah, just get straight to the point.

42:20.890 --> 42:23.609
Okay, how 'bout: "Hey, Donovan"...

42:23.610 --> 42:26.020
- Help me out. Help me out.
- Um...

42:26.021 --> 42:28.188
"I can no longer honor
our prior agreement".

42:28.189 --> 42:30.375
No, that's too legal.

42:30.376 --> 42:34.379
Um, "I'm having a hard
time sticking to our deal".

42:34.380 --> 42:37.364
Okay, "I like you a lot", winky face.

42:37.365 --> 42:38.741
No, no, no, no, no. No emojis.

42:38.742 --> 42:41.794
- What else?
- "I like you a lot, but I want kids".

42:41.795 --> 42:43.037
I don't know if I want kids.

42:43.038 --> 42:44.222
Doesn't matter, always negotiate

42:44.223 --> 42:45.631
from the strongest position.

42:45.632 --> 42:47.225
"I want kids".

42:47.226 --> 42:50.061
Can he be open to the
possibility of having more?

42:50.062 --> 42:51.229
Ooh, it's good.

42:51.230 --> 42:52.713
- Heart.
- No.

42:52.714 --> 42:54.140
- Heart.
- No emojis.

42:55.568 --> 42:56.734
Too late, just sent.

42:56.735 --> 42:58.777
Okay.

42:58.778 --> 43:00.071
- He's typing.
- Oh, God.

43:00.072 --> 43:02.481
Uh, he's not typing anymore.

43:02.482 --> 43:04.058
Yeah, maybe this was a bad idea.

43:04.059 --> 43:06.101
You told me to text him.

43:06.102 --> 43:09.080
- Did I?
- You definitely did.

43:09.081 --> 43:11.157
- Now what should we do?
- Just wait.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
