01:05.000 --> 01:07.100
Oh, I bet you that's Trudy right now.

01:07.300 --> 01:09.200
Harve, would you get that?

01:12.400 --> 01:14.300
Harve, get that, will you?

01:15.300 --> 01:17.300
<i>To the 35, 40. What a block.</i>

01:17.600 --> 01:19.800
<i>Forty-five, still going.
Brought down at the 50.</i>

01:20.100 --> 01:23.300
Okay, buster, no tapioca for you.

01:23.900 --> 01:25.300
- Hey, everybody.
- Hi.

01:25.600 --> 01:26.500
Hi, Trudy.

01:26.700 --> 01:29.400
I froze my patootie off waiting
for someone to open that door.

01:29.800 --> 01:32.500
You know how those New Ulm men
get when the Vikings play.

01:32.800 --> 01:36.300
- Yeah, I know.
- So, Trudy, I've got cocoa, tea or cider.

01:36.600 --> 01:37.600
Cider. Thank you.

01:37.900 --> 01:39.900
So, what's the latest?

01:40.200 --> 01:42.700
You girls are terrible.
You start right in on that gossip.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.400
It's not gossip, it's news.

01:44.700 --> 01:46.600
Yes, Blanche, it's news.

01:46.900 --> 01:48.100
So spit it out.

01:48.300 --> 01:51.000
The reason I was late
is because I just got off the phone...

01:51.300 --> 01:54.600
...with Munck headquarters in Miami.
- What did they want?

01:54.900 --> 01:58.100
To rent a house for the new
plant manager they're sending here.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.000
- No way.
- Yes way.

02:00.300 --> 02:02.700
We remember what happened
to that last plant manager...

02:03.000 --> 02:04.900
...that Stu and his fellas
ran out of town.

02:05.200 --> 02:07.100
The one that choked
on the knackwurst...

02:07.400 --> 02:09.199
...during the Braunschweiger
competition?

02:09.500 --> 02:12.900
Or what about the manager Stu had
stand too close to the glockenspiel?

02:13.200 --> 02:15.100
You know I heard
he still has tinnitus?

02:15.400 --> 02:18.200
- What's that?
- Well, it's like:

02:29.200 --> 02:31.900
All day long for the rest of your life.

02:32.100 --> 02:33.600
Oh, my God, that's horrible.

02:33.900 --> 02:35.600
Don't forget
the Land O' Lakes manager...

02:35.900 --> 02:38.500
...that mysteriously got locked into
the dairy cooler.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.200
What that man had to do
in that cooler to survive...

02:42.500 --> 02:43.700
It's unmentionable.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.800
God bless our new plant manager
whoever the poor guy is.

02:49.200 --> 02:50.200
Amen.

02:50.500 --> 02:51.900
Amen.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.500
Good morning. Munck Foods.

03:56.300 --> 03:57.400
Sorry I'm late.

03:57.600 --> 04:00.400
- We haven't gotten far.
- We had to wait for you.

04:02.500 --> 04:04.900
We were discussing
how getting the New Ulm facility...

04:05.200 --> 04:08.400
...dumped on our division
is going to affect our bottom line.

04:08.800 --> 04:11.200
Well, wouldn't it just be better
to close the plant?

04:11.400 --> 04:13.000
It looks like a lost cause to me.

04:13.300 --> 04:17.100
Yes, but Marketing wants to cross
our branding in the youth demo...

04:17.399 --> 04:21.800
...with the adult protein craze with
Rocket Bars, protein snacks for kids.

04:22.200 --> 04:23.900
Now, we can use
the existing facility...

04:24.200 --> 04:26.800
...but we'll have to automate it
to produce the new line...

04:27.100 --> 04:30.600
...downsize production,
reduce the workforce by 50 percent.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.200
The question is, who will oversee it?

04:37.800 --> 04:39.500
Don't all of you volunteer at once.

04:45.500 --> 04:46.800
I can do it.

04:47.600 --> 04:50.600
And, hey, Lucy's single.
She could do the conversion on-site.

04:50.900 --> 04:53.300
- That's not in the proposal.
- On-site would expedite it.

04:53.600 --> 04:54.900
You'll go immediately.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.900
Joan, book Lucy to Minnesota
this weekend.

04:58.600 --> 05:00.500
This...? Minnesota?

05:00.800 --> 05:01.900
Knew I could count on you.

05:37.400 --> 05:40.100
- Can I give you a hand with that?
- Oh, I've got it. Thank you.

05:40.400 --> 05:41.600
All right.

06:25.900 --> 06:27.800
How bad can it be?

06:39.100 --> 06:40.800
Holy mother...

06:41.100 --> 06:44.100
<i>Traveling on Flight 116
to New Orleans.</i>

06:44.400 --> 06:46.700
<i>Flight 116.</i>

07:27.600 --> 07:30.300
I'm spending winter in a theme park.

07:48.700 --> 07:50.800
Okay.

07:54.500 --> 07:58.200
Oh, my Lord,
locked the door at 5 out of habit.

07:59.900 --> 08:02.500
Can we help you?

08:02.900 --> 08:05.600
Yeah, I'm looking
for Blanche Gunderson.

08:05.900 --> 08:07.600
My assistant, Cathy, called.

08:07.900 --> 08:09.100
You must be Miss Hill.

08:09.300 --> 08:10.900
I'm Blanche Gunderson.

08:11.800 --> 08:14.100
You're my executive assistant?

08:14.300 --> 08:15.400
Oh, heavens, no.

08:15.700 --> 08:16.600
I'm just a secretary.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.600
Did you need me to find you
one of those?

08:19.500 --> 08:20.400
We'll see.

08:20.700 --> 08:22.500
What you need to find
is a place to live.

08:22.800 --> 08:26.200
Right. So this is your realtor, Trudy.

08:26.500 --> 08:27.900
Trudy Van Uuden at your service.

08:28.200 --> 08:30.500
That's with two U's.
A double U, not a W.

08:31.800 --> 08:34.299
I'll drive. What do you say
you follow with Ms. Hill?

08:34.700 --> 08:36.100
Oh, good idea.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.900
Oh, your luggage all matches.

08:39.100 --> 08:40.900
That's so nice.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.700
Say cheese.

08:50.900 --> 08:52.100
Are you a scrapper?

08:52.400 --> 08:53.300
Excuse me?

08:53.500 --> 08:54.900
Oh, there's Merle. Hey, Merle.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.400
That's our mailman, Merle.

08:58.700 --> 09:00.400
That's what we call him.
Mailman Merle.

09:00.700 --> 09:04.000
Because he delivers the mail,
and he's our mailman.

09:04.400 --> 09:07.100
So, you know?

09:08.700 --> 09:10.300
Oh, yeah,
do you keep a scrapbook?

09:11.000 --> 09:12.000
Because I do.

09:12.300 --> 09:13.400
I'm a scrapper, see.

09:13.600 --> 09:15.500
We even got a club.

09:15.700 --> 09:17.700
I got a mini in my bag here.

09:19.100 --> 09:23.000
Okay, so this here is our dog,
Winston Churchill.

09:23.300 --> 09:25.600
He's dead.
He was a bit of drooler, I'm afraid.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.000
And this here is my kitty, Snowflake.

09:29.300 --> 09:30.400
She's dead too.

09:30.600 --> 09:34.200
We had to put her down
on account of that kitty-leukemia thing.

09:34.600 --> 09:38.300
You should've seen the kinds of things
she was barfing up on our couch.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.400
Poor thing. Bless her heart.

09:41.500 --> 09:44.000
She's not dead in the picture though.
She's just sleeping.

09:44.300 --> 09:48.400
Could I look at that later maybe?

09:48.800 --> 09:50.000
Okay?

09:51.100 --> 09:52.300
So...

09:54.900 --> 09:56.700
Are you married?
Do you have children?

09:57.000 --> 09:58.500
No, no. I'm not married.

09:58.800 --> 10:01.000
Oh, you're still young, you know?

10:01.300 --> 10:02.300
Relatively.

10:03.100 --> 10:07.600
I mean, you still got time, I suppose.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.900
Do you eat meat, or are you one
of those vegetarian people?

10:12.200 --> 10:14.700
No. I'm not a vegetarian.

10:15.100 --> 10:18.100
- Why?
- Because it's your first night in town.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.700
Don't think we're gonna let you
go hungry.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.300
You're coming to my house for dinner.
Nothing fancy, of course.

10:24.700 --> 10:26.500
Meatloaf.

10:30.900 --> 10:33.500
Do you mind
if I ask you a personal question?

10:35.100 --> 10:38.500
Isn't that what you've been doing?

10:40.900 --> 10:41.900
Have you found Jesus?

10:45.300 --> 10:47.900
Well, I didn't know he was missing.

10:59.900 --> 11:01.600
It was just a joke.

11:02.600 --> 11:05.800
Normally we don't joke
about Jesus around here.

11:09.200 --> 11:12.000
But I can see how you'd think
that was sort of funny.

11:12.200 --> 11:14.800
Imagine Jesus gone missing.

11:16.100 --> 11:17.600
Imagine.

11:37.400 --> 11:38.700
It's clearing. Chill coming on.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.900
It's gonna get a heck of a lot colder.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.800
This place is big, but what the hey.

11:44.900 --> 11:47.000
Colder?

11:48.600 --> 11:51.400
It gets colder?

11:51.700 --> 11:52.600
Oh, yeah.

11:56.900 --> 11:58.200
Oh, good. Electric is still on.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.500
Heat's LP. Tank's out back.
Furnace is a Norge.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.900
The pipes are wrapped.
Windows are two-paned.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.200
And there's a double layer
of Owens Corning.

12:05.500 --> 12:08.800
Hardwood. You got rugs to keep from
freezing the bejesus out of your toes.

12:09.100 --> 12:10.600
Wait, you just lost me.

12:10.900 --> 12:12.400
No problem. What didn't you get?

12:12.600 --> 12:15.300
Well, I understood
that the electric is still on.

12:20.900 --> 12:22.900
- Does that work?
- Oh, sure as shooting.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.000
Okay. Then I'll take it.

12:25.300 --> 12:26.700
Want me to go over the fireplace?

12:27.000 --> 12:30.200
No, I'm a city girl,
but I know how to light a fire.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.200
Where's the switch?

12:40.700 --> 12:42.800
She seems nice enough.

12:43.100 --> 12:45.900
I doubt she'll last a week.
Poor thing.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.700
There you are.
I was starting to wonder.

12:59.100 --> 13:00.500
I got lost.

13:00.700 --> 13:02.900
You said it was around
the other side of the lake.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.100
Every direction I went,
there was a lake.

13:05.400 --> 13:07.500
That's not even a lake.
That's Luden Pond.

13:07.800 --> 13:09.400
I turned around.
I found another lake.

13:09.700 --> 13:12.500
Oh, I bet you went
to Van Meyer Slough.

13:12.800 --> 13:15.300
- And then I went left.
- That's actually a stone quarry.

13:15.700 --> 13:17.500
But you made it.

13:17.800 --> 13:19.200
Yeah.

13:22.400 --> 13:25.400
Oh, Harve, company.

13:25.800 --> 13:28.500
I didn't know whether
to get red or white.

13:29.400 --> 13:32.900
But all they had
was Zinfandel anyway, so...

13:33.300 --> 13:38.200
Oh, hell, anything you can uncork,
uncap or unscrew, I'll drink it.

13:38.900 --> 13:43.200
This is my husband, Harve.
You'd think he's joking, but he's not.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.900
- Take your coat?
- Yes. Please.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.900
That would be great.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.500
Thank you.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.200
You okay like that?
You're not too cold?

13:58.500 --> 13:59.500
No. I'm fine.

14:00.900 --> 14:03.300
Oh, okay,
because you look a little cold.

14:03.600 --> 14:05.300
I'm fine.

14:14.100 --> 14:16.700
Anyhow, there's someone
that I want you to meet.

14:17.100 --> 14:18.500
I'm hoping that you hit it off.

14:18.700 --> 14:23.200
If you do, it's gonna make your stay
here in Minnesota a lot more pleasant.

14:24.500 --> 14:28.600
So, Lucy Hill, this is Ted Mitchell.

14:30.500 --> 14:31.900
Damn.

14:32.200 --> 14:33.200
Damn.

14:33.400 --> 14:36.300
- Oh, so it's a whole dinner party.
- Oh, yeah.

14:36.700 --> 14:37.900
Lovely. Thank you.

14:38.100 --> 14:39.600
How you doing?

14:40.300 --> 14:43.500
You've got beer dripping
from your chin.

14:44.200 --> 14:46.500
- Awesome.
- Can I use your powder room?

14:46.800 --> 14:49.800
You betcha. It's right through
the kitchen to the right.

15:11.400 --> 15:13.100
- Yeah?
- Lucy, we thought we'd open...

15:13.400 --> 15:15.600
...that wine with dinner.
Would you like a glass?

15:15.900 --> 15:17.000
Yeah, that would be great.

15:17.200 --> 15:20.100
You know,
I actually am feeling a little chilly.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.000
Would you mind
bringing my jacket?

15:22.200 --> 15:23.700
Oh, you betcha.

15:25.600 --> 15:26.800
God.

15:33.900 --> 15:37.100
- Blanche, this meatloaf is good.
- Oh, thank you, Ted.

15:47.700 --> 15:49.900
So, Ted, do you live around here?

15:52.600 --> 15:54.000
Yeah.

15:54.300 --> 15:55.800
Yeah, I moved up here.

15:56.100 --> 15:57.300
Little over 10 years ago.

15:58.100 --> 15:59.100
Why?

16:00.500 --> 16:02.900
I mean, not that it's not nice.
I'm sure.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.300
But why?

16:06.300 --> 16:08.200
Why not, you know?

16:11.100 --> 16:12.500
What's so great about a city?

16:13.500 --> 16:17.500
Well, I mean,
the cultural advantages alone.

16:17.900 --> 16:21.900
Museums, opera, ballet, theater.
Not to mention nightlife.

16:22.300 --> 16:24.000
Oh, yeah.

16:24.300 --> 16:27.400
Do you know I was in a restaurant,
and Justin Timberlake walked in?

16:27.700 --> 16:31.000
- For real?
- Is he one of your MP3 fellas?

16:31.700 --> 16:33.700
Oh, that's nice.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
I thought all they had
was skinny supermodels...

16:36.300 --> 16:37.600
...and Colombian drug lords.

16:38.300 --> 16:40.700
Ted, that's terrible.

16:41.900 --> 16:44.200
You know who else was there,
Bobbie?

16:45.200 --> 16:46.200
Fergie.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.000
I bet you like her music, huh?

16:48.300 --> 16:50.400
My dad won't let me like that stuff.

16:51.500 --> 16:54.300
Well, you seem old enough
to decide for yourself what you like.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.100
Excuse me?

16:56.700 --> 17:00.100
Women like that just selling
themselves as sex objects?

17:01.000 --> 17:03.700
What kind of a role model is that
for young girls?

17:04.900 --> 17:08.900
I think that any examples of strong
successful young women are vital.

17:09.300 --> 17:13.200
And that's how you measure success?
By how provocative a woman can be?

17:13.599 --> 17:15.500
We'll pass on that.
We'll listen to country.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.300
Oh, the twangy drivel
about the losers who drink beer...

17:18.599 --> 17:20.300
...and drive pickup trucks?

17:20.599 --> 17:22.000
Yeah.

17:23.400 --> 17:26.400
How about polka?
It's got something for everybody.

17:26.700 --> 17:28.800
That's it, Harve,
you're exactly right. Bingo.

17:30.600 --> 17:31.800
I like beer.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.900
I drive a pickup.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.300
I should have known.

17:45.800 --> 17:48.700
You probably drive a new car
for what it says about you...

17:49.000 --> 17:50.500
...when what it says about you...

17:50.800 --> 17:54.000
...is how you bow down to the big
corporations that made a gravy train.

17:54.400 --> 17:56.700
And would anybody like
more gravy?

17:57.000 --> 17:57.900
Trudy? Kimberley?

17:58.100 --> 18:01.600
Industrial competition in a free-market
economy is what built this country.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.400
No, robber barons built it, and they
did it from the blood of working folks.

18:05.700 --> 18:08.100
If you steal somebody's car,
you get thrown in jail.

18:08.400 --> 18:10.700
If you steal life savings,
you get to be a CEO.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.500
I'm planning on being a CEO.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.300
You better count the silverware
before she leaves.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.600
- I'm leaving now.
- Not if I leave first.

18:17.900 --> 18:20.300
- Come on, baby.
- I've got Snickerdoodles with tapioca.

18:20.600 --> 18:22.400
- Thanks for dinner.
- Thanks for dinner.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.700
Totally awesome.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.600
Miss Hill.

20:02.300 --> 20:04.800
Stu Kopenhafer, plant foreman.

20:05.100 --> 20:06.600
I'm supposed to show you around.

20:15.700 --> 20:18.200
Milk processors, cooking facilities.

20:18.600 --> 20:21.000
Curdling vats, slop sinks...

20:21.300 --> 20:23.900
...auxiliary refrigeration,
more slop sinks.

20:24.500 --> 20:25.800
Storage racks over there.

20:26.500 --> 20:30.100
Conveyor belt.
This is your main production floor.

20:31.100 --> 20:33.700
I'd really like to speak
with the workers.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
Where can I do that?

20:40.900 --> 20:42.000
Bob.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.600
What are you waiting for?

20:54.400 --> 20:55.800
Greetings, New Ulm.

20:56.100 --> 20:59.900
I'm here to usher in a new phase.

21:00.300 --> 21:01.800
This is a great opportunity.

21:02.000 --> 21:05.900
I'm here to reconfigure
for the initialization of Rocket Bars.

21:14.300 --> 21:17.100
This will be an exciting utilization
of new branding...

21:17.500 --> 21:20.600
...for capitalizing
on a highly profitable demographic.

21:20.900 --> 21:21.900
Cut to the chase.

21:22.200 --> 21:25.600
We don't give a fart on a muggy day
what you're making us make.

21:25.900 --> 21:27.900
Tell us how many you're planning
on laying off.

21:28.200 --> 21:30.800
Management at Munck Foods
in Miami has sent me here...

21:31.100 --> 21:33.500
...to conduct mechanization
and modernization procedures.

21:33.800 --> 21:36.400
Yeah, you Munck-ees all say
that crap.

21:36.800 --> 21:39.400
But every time one of you comes,
we end up losing jobs.

21:39.700 --> 21:41.700
Well, I'm interested
in the jobs we'll create.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.400
If you're not, that's fine, but I'll expect
you to implement the changes...

21:45.700 --> 21:47.300
...in a timely manner.

21:47.600 --> 21:48.900
Okay?

21:50.600 --> 21:52.400
Oh, yeah, well, nice try, Trudy.

21:52.700 --> 21:54.600
No, you're not getting
that recipe out of me.

21:54.900 --> 21:55.900
Because I...

21:56.200 --> 21:57.900
All right, listen, gotta go.
Okay, yeah.

21:58.100 --> 21:59.200
Let me jump.

21:59.500 --> 22:01.500
Yeah, okay, I know.
I'll give it to you later.

22:01.800 --> 22:03.900
Okay, bye-bye then. Yeah, bye.

22:04.200 --> 22:05.700
Oh, good morning.
Sorry about that.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.600
That was Trudy. She's always trying
to get my tapioca recipe out of me.

22:09.900 --> 22:13.700
Yeah, well, I doubt that your tapioca
recipe is gonna affect the plant.

22:14.100 --> 22:15.900
So let's just stick to work
if we could.

22:16.200 --> 22:18.200
Oh, okay.
Oh, listen, sorry about being late.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.100
Billy had a run-in up at the school.

22:20.300 --> 22:22.600
Had to go talk to the principal,
don't you know?

22:22.900 --> 22:26.400
He thinks he's a little Puff Diddly,
in case you didn't notice last night.

22:28.400 --> 22:30.600
- Is that my office?
- Oh, yeah.

22:30.900 --> 22:32.600
I'd like to see you in there, please.

22:34.500 --> 22:37.600
As a female, do you know
how I'm on the fast track to VP...

22:38.000 --> 22:40.100
...in a Fortune 500 company?
- No, I don't.

22:40.400 --> 22:44.200
When it's time to work,
I concentrate on work.

22:44.700 --> 22:47.300
- I get you.
- And I expect one's personal life...

22:47.700 --> 22:49.000
...to be kept personal.

22:49.200 --> 22:51.500
- Okay, that's easy.
- But not you, apparently.

22:51.800 --> 22:54.200
You're trying to set me up
after having just met me.

22:55.800 --> 22:58.700
- Well, actually...
- I don't want excuses.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.200
I am here to do a job.

23:00.500 --> 23:03.100
I will not get personally attached
to this town or anybody.

23:03.400 --> 23:05.600
- Okay, but listen...
- No buts.

23:06.000 --> 23:09.200
But for the sake of argument,
let's say I did want to get set up.

23:09.600 --> 23:13.400
Trying to hook me up with that guy?
I may be in the middle of nowhere.

23:13.700 --> 23:17.200
But I am not so desperate that I would
consider your sorry-ass truck guy.

23:17.600 --> 23:19.100
- Right. Sorry-ass truck guy.
- Good.

23:19.400 --> 23:23.500
Now that that's clear,
let's just brush that off.

23:23.800 --> 23:28.300
So I can spend the rest of the morning
kissing the ass of the local union rep.

23:28.700 --> 23:31.000
Who I actually think is here.

23:41.100 --> 23:43.500
Why is he out there?

23:45.100 --> 23:46.800
Funny story.

23:48.400 --> 23:51.000
It might have been presumptuous
of me to try to set you up...

23:51.400 --> 23:53.500
...but I thought it might help
professionally...

23:53.800 --> 23:55.500
...if you were to meet
the union rep...

23:55.700 --> 23:58.100
...for all of southeastern Minnesota
casually...

23:58.400 --> 24:00.300
...over a nice home-cooked dinner.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.600
Ted is the local union rep?

24:04.500 --> 24:06.000
That's right.

24:06.300 --> 24:08.600
The guy that I yelled at
over your meatloaf?

24:08.900 --> 24:10.700
And in the driveway some too.

24:20.600 --> 24:21.900
Mr. Mitchell.

24:22.100 --> 24:23.800
Ted, wasn't it?

24:24.100 --> 24:27.500
Yeah. But some people refer to me
as "sorry-ass truck guy."

24:28.600 --> 24:29.900
I beg your pardon?

24:31.000 --> 24:33.800
Union's been pushing
for better soundproofing in this plant.

24:34.100 --> 24:37.100
But I think they should probably
extend it to the office walls too.

24:37.500 --> 24:38.400
Shall we?

24:41.300 --> 24:45.400
Well, going over union regulations
for two hours is not helping.

24:45.800 --> 24:49.400
What I'm trying to do is make sure that
during this simple reconfiguration...

24:49.800 --> 24:52.800
...as you call it,
that not one union job gets cut.

24:53.100 --> 24:54.700
I'm sure we can come
to an agreement.

24:55.000 --> 24:58.400
I'm gonna make sure that you comply
with that agreement every step.

24:58.700 --> 24:59.600
Goodbye.

24:59.900 --> 25:01.300
How is the first day going?

25:01.500 --> 25:03.000
It's been a very productive day.

25:03.300 --> 25:05.500
I've spoken to the employees
and the plant foreman.

25:05.800 --> 25:08.300
And they are very engaged
in the process.

25:08.600 --> 25:10.800
I've laid out my work strategy
with my assistant.

25:11.100 --> 25:13.800
And I've begun dialoguing
with the local union rep.

25:14.200 --> 25:17.100
I'm sure I'll be able to forge
a working relationship there.

25:17.400 --> 25:19.800
All right, but if we're gonna downsize
by 50 percent...

25:20.100 --> 25:22.500
...I need you to prioritize
your termination list.

25:22.800 --> 25:25.300
Hi there. I wanted to let you know
I've rearranged my desk.

25:25.600 --> 25:27.900
It looks so nice
and professional now.

25:28.200 --> 25:31.100
So if you need anything, a drink,
or a snack, or you get homesick...

25:31.500 --> 25:33.400
...you wanna talk,
you just give me a shout.

25:36.800 --> 25:39.400
I'm so sorry.

25:43.300 --> 25:46.300
Oh, I'm already on that.

26:06.700 --> 26:09.300
All I'm asking
is that we move these machines...

26:09.600 --> 26:12.100
...to make room
for the new production equipment.

26:12.400 --> 26:13.400
Yeah, no.

26:13.700 --> 26:16.600
- That's not the way we do things.
- Nope, not the way we do things.

26:16.900 --> 26:18.200
Not the way at all.

26:18.500 --> 26:20.800
You're going to have to make
some concessions.

26:21.100 --> 26:23.300
Oh, we're making
some damn concessions.

26:23.600 --> 26:25.100
Like Gopher Day.

26:25.400 --> 26:27.000
- Gopher Day?
- Yeah.

26:27.200 --> 26:29.600
Local holiday.
First Friday of November.

26:30.000 --> 26:33.000
We've always gotten it off before,
but we're all working this one.

26:33.300 --> 26:34.200
Okay.

26:34.400 --> 26:36.400
If I close the plant
for Gopher Day at noon...

26:36.700 --> 26:39.200
...then come Monday,
you'll start shifting equipment?

26:39.500 --> 26:41.300
- Sure. You betcha.
- Yeah, okay.

26:41.500 --> 26:42.600
Great.

26:58.200 --> 26:59.400
Happy Gopher Day.

27:25.400 --> 27:26.500
Is there a problem here?

27:26.800 --> 27:29.300
You're damn right
there's a problem.

27:29.600 --> 27:31.700
You know, Land O' Lakes
was doing just fine...

27:32.000 --> 27:34.500
...before you greedy Munck-ees
captured it...

27:34.800 --> 27:37.600
...and started killing off
my loyal hardworking customers.

27:40.600 --> 27:42.200
Listen, Flo.

27:42.500 --> 27:44.100
I'm here to do a job.

27:44.400 --> 27:49.400
Just like I'd like you to do your job now
by taking my order, okay?

27:51.800 --> 27:52.700
Great.

27:53.000 --> 27:57.400
Now that that's clear,
what's the special today?

27:59.000 --> 28:02.600
We got a Go-Back-to-Miami
Where-You-Belong special.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.200
Oh, and Happy Gopher Day.

28:10.400 --> 28:14.300
How lame-ass do you have to be
to fall for something as butt-stupid...

28:14.600 --> 28:17.400
...as thinking there's a Gopher Day?

28:53.200 --> 28:54.900
Oh, shingles.

28:55.200 --> 28:57.400
Who invited the boss lady?

28:59.800 --> 29:01.500
What do you want?

29:01.900 --> 29:04.000
I thought I might buy you a beer.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.700
It's a free country.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.500
A proactive approach
to streamline production...

29:10.800 --> 29:12.600
...creates a win-win situation.

29:13.800 --> 29:17.400
Of course, it requires strategization
and advanced specialization.

29:17.700 --> 29:18.900
Yeah.

29:21.000 --> 29:22.500
This is really great, guys.

29:22.700 --> 29:24.600
I'm glad we're finally dialoguing.

29:24.900 --> 29:26.000
D-word, double shot.

29:30.600 --> 29:33.900
Are you guys really interested
in discussing mechanization?

29:34.200 --> 29:35.300
Hell, yeah.

29:40.600 --> 29:41.500
I'm really sorry, guys.

29:41.700 --> 29:44.700
I meant for that to be a D-word,
so you can all do a double shot.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.600
Way to ruin it, Maurice.

29:48.200 --> 29:53.000
You know, I'm in charge of this plant
whether you like it or not.

29:53.600 --> 29:56.500
I thought this would be an opportunity
for us to bury the hatchet...

29:56.800 --> 30:00.600
...but, instead, you just turn me
into some dumb drinking game?

30:01.000 --> 30:03.500
Thanks a lot, asshole.

30:15.300 --> 30:16.500
Oh, hi there.

30:16.700 --> 30:19.300
It's official.
The lakes froze enough to drive on.

30:19.700 --> 30:22.300
So Stu declared it a holiday.

30:24.800 --> 30:25.800
He did, did he?

30:27.600 --> 30:29.400
And where can I find Stu?

31:17.600 --> 31:19.300
Now, who invited boss lady
this time?

31:19.600 --> 31:22.100
You miserable son of a bitch.

31:22.400 --> 31:24.700
Ice Day?
What, Gopher Day wasn't enough?

31:25.000 --> 31:28.900
Well, you've underestimated who
you're messing with, Stu Kopenhafer.

31:29.300 --> 31:31.000
You're fired.

31:35.700 --> 31:37.000
Crap.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.600
You can't fire Stu.

31:42.900 --> 31:44.900
I can, and I did.

31:45.200 --> 31:46.100
Ice Day?

31:46.300 --> 31:48.200
Just how stupid
does everyone think I am?

31:48.500 --> 31:50.300
What? On a scale of one to 10?

31:50.600 --> 31:53.400
The first day of ice fishing
is a state holiday.

31:53.900 --> 31:54.900
Fine.

31:55.200 --> 31:56.700
I fired him for insubordination.

31:56.900 --> 31:58.500
Hang on a second.

31:59.200 --> 32:00.600
Stu...

32:00.900 --> 32:04.100
He takes a little while to warm up
to folks, but he's a really good man.

32:04.400 --> 32:05.900
Good?

32:06.900 --> 32:09.000
Clearly, we define that differently.

32:09.300 --> 32:12.200
But I'm just trying to help you
out here, okay?

32:12.600 --> 32:14.400
Firing the foreman
before Thanksgiving...

32:14.700 --> 32:16.300
...that's not gonna win you friends.

32:16.500 --> 32:18.800
Well, I'm here to do a job,
not make friends.

32:19.100 --> 32:20.800
Stu's fired.

32:21.100 --> 32:22.700
Good night.

32:32.100 --> 32:35.200
You expect me to believe
that every machine in the line...

32:35.500 --> 32:38.400
...just broke down at the same time?

32:53.700 --> 32:56.100
<i>And Thanksgiving
is gonna be a white one.</i>

32:56.300 --> 32:57.900
<i>We're expecting
another snowstorm...</i>

32:58.100 --> 32:59.900
<i>...blowing in
sometime tomorrow afternoon.</i>

33:00.200 --> 33:04.600
It doesn't matter. I'm going to Miami.

33:43.900 --> 33:45.900
That's right.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.600
Come on.

34:19.400 --> 34:21.400
Oh, come on.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.199
Oh, this is not good.

35:28.500 --> 35:30.100
Hey.

35:41.300 --> 35:44.200
I'm in... I'm in here.

35:46.600 --> 35:48.200
Help.

35:49.100 --> 35:50.700
Help.

35:52.400 --> 35:54.600
Help. I'm in here.

36:12.600 --> 36:14.300
Thanks a lot, God.

36:14.600 --> 36:15.800
Come on.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.400
- Okay.
- I got you.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.600
Okay. Hey...

36:19.900 --> 36:23.400
Watch the hands,
Mr. Touchy-Feely Hands.

36:23.800 --> 36:25.300
Don't flatter yourself.

36:25.500 --> 36:27.500
I'm trying to get you out of the car.
Come on.

36:27.800 --> 36:31.600
For your information,
I do not need a man to rescue me.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.900
- All right.
- Okay.

36:47.200 --> 36:48.500
Come on.

36:51.400 --> 36:53.100
Let's get you home.

37:14.900 --> 37:19.700
You know, you're not so bad
when you're unconscious.

37:45.700 --> 37:48.100
- Come on.
- Oh, yup.

37:50.600 --> 37:52.500
I got it, I got it.

37:52.800 --> 37:54.700
- I got it.
- You okay?

38:00.300 --> 38:02.000
I got it. I got it.

38:02.300 --> 38:05.500
I don't need to be carried
through my door...

38:05.800 --> 38:09.200
...by some sexy fireman man.

38:09.600 --> 38:11.600
You already gave me
that lecture.

38:11.800 --> 38:12.900
You think I'm sexy, huh?

38:13.100 --> 38:14.900
What? Why would you think that?

38:15.200 --> 38:16.900
Because you just said it.

38:17.200 --> 38:19.000
Out loud?

38:23.700 --> 38:24.600
Here, let me help you.

38:24.800 --> 38:25.800
- I got it.
- Hold on.

38:26.100 --> 38:28.300
- I got it.
- Let me help you, let me help you.

38:31.300 --> 38:33.500
Don't get any ideas.

38:33.800 --> 38:35.000
I'm not.

38:35.200 --> 38:36.400
You okay?

38:36.700 --> 38:38.500
I'm fine.

38:39.600 --> 38:41.100
Fine.

38:49.200 --> 38:51.600
- You okay?
- Yeah.

38:51.900 --> 38:53.600
I'm fine.

39:59.500 --> 40:03.000
This will be a good chance for you
to get out and about a little more.

40:03.900 --> 40:05.300
Hi, girls.

40:06.300 --> 40:07.800
We've sold all your tapioca.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.500
Oh, good.

40:13.900 --> 40:15.600
How about that rescue?

40:15.900 --> 40:17.700
No wonder
she's looking twitterpated.

40:17.900 --> 40:20.000
Oh, getting saved
by a cutie patootie like that...

40:20.300 --> 40:23.100
...no one could blame you
for getting a little crush, you know?

40:23.500 --> 40:24.700
Crush?

40:24.900 --> 40:26.000
Ted?

40:26.300 --> 40:27.200
I don't think so.

40:27.400 --> 40:30.200
Speaking of your rescue,
we made this.

40:30.600 --> 40:32.000
You keep that in your trunk.

40:32.200 --> 40:33.900
It's got our names and numbers
sewn in...

40:34.200 --> 40:36.100
...so next time
you have emergency contacts.

40:36.400 --> 40:39.900
Oh, that's... That's beautiful.

40:40.200 --> 40:42.300
- You didn't have to do that.
- Oh, we know.

40:42.600 --> 40:45.300
But we did it anyways,
and that's what matters the most.

40:45.700 --> 40:47.600
Just the thought of you
out in that storm.

40:47.800 --> 40:49.800
You must have been scared
out of your mind.

40:50.100 --> 40:52.200
Oh, I'm sure I was never
in any real danger.

40:52.400 --> 40:53.900
You kidding?

40:54.200 --> 40:56.800
Folks around these parts
freeze to death all the time.

40:57.100 --> 40:58.600
Especially the stupid ones.

40:58.900 --> 41:02.100
It's nature's way
of thinning out the herd, if you ask me.

41:03.200 --> 41:05.500
And that Ted,
he's a handsome devil.

41:05.800 --> 41:08.700
Now he's bending over
to lift that hose.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.600
Oh, will you just lookie there?

41:16.200 --> 41:19.800
You guys cannot handle that.

41:20.800 --> 41:22.100
I don't know about that.

41:22.400 --> 41:24.100
- Hey.
- Hi.

41:24.500 --> 41:26.700
Hey, so the other night.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.900
I was a little drunk.

41:29.200 --> 41:30.900
I might have said some things.

41:31.100 --> 41:32.600
Hey, you were great out there, huh?

41:32.900 --> 41:34.100
Here, kid, come here.

41:35.200 --> 41:36.600
I am so proud of you.

41:37.600 --> 41:40.400
You remember Lucy Hill?
This is Bobbie.

41:40.900 --> 41:42.200
Hi.

41:42.500 --> 41:43.700
What's up?

41:44.400 --> 41:47.300
Crosscheck by the goalie. Nice.

41:57.400 --> 41:58.800
It's great.

42:04.500 --> 42:06.100
Blanche.

42:07.600 --> 42:09.800
Thank you for cashing in my ticket.

42:10.100 --> 42:11.800
Oh, no trouble at all. Oh, and listen.

42:12.100 --> 42:13.800
Your car's all fixed up good as new.

42:14.900 --> 42:16.100
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

42:16.400 --> 42:18.300
A little something for you.

42:19.100 --> 42:20.500
Oh, it's money.

42:24.100 --> 42:25.500
It's a holiday bonus.

42:25.800 --> 42:27.000
Don't you usually get one?

42:28.600 --> 42:30.300
Normally, we exchange gifts.

42:30.600 --> 42:31.900
But this is nice too.

42:32.900 --> 42:34.700
Oh, and listen.

42:35.500 --> 42:37.200
Here's a little Merry Christmas
for you.

42:38.100 --> 42:40.200
Oh, Blanche, you didn't have
to get me anything.

42:40.500 --> 42:43.700
Oh, I didn't get it,
not like store-bought get it.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.600
I made it.

42:45.900 --> 42:46.900
Here, open it.

42:51.900 --> 42:54.200
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

42:59.000 --> 43:02.000
Just in case
you wanted to start scrapping.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.400
"To Lucy. From Blanche."

43:19.300 --> 43:21.800
That was your first day here,
remember?

43:30.000 --> 43:31.500
When did you take that?

43:31.800 --> 43:33.900
Oh, that was a while ago.

43:34.200 --> 43:37.200
You looked like you had the weight
of the world on your shoulders.

43:37.500 --> 43:39.200
So alone.

43:40.600 --> 43:43.200
But, you know, Lucy,
you're never really alone.

43:43.600 --> 43:46.200
Jesus understands
what you're going through.

43:46.500 --> 43:48.500
He's there for you.

43:49.600 --> 43:51.300
So am I.

43:57.900 --> 44:01.000
Hey, don't go getting all misty
on me.

44:01.400 --> 44:02.600
Here. I got something else.

44:02.800 --> 44:05.200
This ought to cheer you right up.

44:06.900 --> 44:08.300
Some tapioca.

44:09.700 --> 44:11.600
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Blanche.

44:11.800 --> 44:13.500
Can I have a hug?

44:23.100 --> 44:24.600
Coming.

45:14.100 --> 45:15.800
Thanks.

46:04.600 --> 46:06.500
Ted is here for your meeting.

46:09.700 --> 46:11.800
- Hi.
- Hi.

46:13.400 --> 46:14.500
Thanks.

46:17.000 --> 46:19.900
Well, isn't this a nice way
to start out the New Year?

46:20.300 --> 46:22.900
"Auld Lang Syne,"
resolutions and all that.

46:24.900 --> 46:28.100
If I can get you two anything,
you two just say the word.

46:34.800 --> 46:37.300
I got the comp analysis here.

46:37.600 --> 46:39.200
Okay.

46:43.200 --> 46:45.400
Before we get started.

46:45.800 --> 46:47.600
I never had the chance
to clear the air...

46:47.900 --> 46:51.500
...after you saved me
from the snow bank.

46:52.700 --> 46:57.300
I said a lot of rude things,
and I handled it badly.

46:58.600 --> 47:02.000
I think you handled it fine.
You didn't try to get out of your car.

47:02.400 --> 47:04.300
And that's good,
because a lot of people...

47:04.600 --> 47:07.900
...they try to walk for help,
and they end up dying that way.

47:08.200 --> 47:10.100
You were just trying to keep warm.

47:10.400 --> 47:13.800
Although, technically,
alcohol isn't recommended.

47:14.200 --> 47:17.600
And the red flag, that was...

47:18.000 --> 47:19.900
That was brilliant.

47:22.500 --> 47:24.800
Now, I don't remember
anything rude.

47:26.900 --> 47:28.900
Well, I don't remember
saying thank you.

47:29.200 --> 47:31.300
And that's hardly sufficient.

47:31.600 --> 47:32.500
So thank you.

47:33.900 --> 47:35.600
You're welcome.

47:37.100 --> 47:38.200
So comp analysis.

47:38.500 --> 47:40.700
Yes, comp analysis.

47:41.000 --> 47:43.800
Okay, should we start
with the executive group?

47:56.200 --> 47:58.300
- Lucy.
- Returning your bowl.

47:58.600 --> 48:00.400
Oh, what a nice surprise.
Come on in.

48:00.700 --> 48:02.700
Lucy's here.

48:03.800 --> 48:06.200
Just so you know,
I transferred it to another container.

48:06.500 --> 48:08.200
It's not like I ate it in one sitting.

48:08.500 --> 48:10.400
- We never do.
- Oh, stop.

48:10.700 --> 48:12.900
Sit down. Listen, it's not fattening.

48:13.200 --> 48:15.700
Ever since Harve's
been on his crazy Atkins kick...

48:16.000 --> 48:18.400
...I had to come up
with a couple of new recipes.

48:18.700 --> 48:20.600
Don't even look at me,
Trudy Van Uuden.

48:20.900 --> 48:22.900
You're not getting my secret
out of me.

48:23.200 --> 48:27.800
But I will tell you, my tapioca's
mainly low-fat milk and whey protein.

48:28.200 --> 48:30.000
- No way.
- Yes, whey.

48:30.300 --> 48:32.700
Just in time.
We're exchanging Valentine's cards.

48:33.000 --> 48:34.500
We've got yours.

48:34.800 --> 48:38.300
Oh, you know, I was just gonna forget
that whole thing this year.

48:38.600 --> 48:41.000
You know,
greeting-card-company holiday.

48:41.300 --> 48:42.800
Here's for you.

48:44.300 --> 48:47.400
Harve? Would you get that?

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
Maybe that's cupid
looking for you right now.

48:51.700 --> 48:52.800
It's just Ted.

48:56.700 --> 48:58.600
I got... I got a big problem.

48:58.900 --> 49:01.700
I need... I need a woman's help
on this one.

49:03.100 --> 49:05.100
It's out... Just out here.

49:05.400 --> 49:07.500
Female trouble?

49:07.800 --> 49:08.700
Sort of.

49:09.000 --> 49:12.200
It's the Valentine's Dance,
you know?

49:12.500 --> 49:15.200
L... I just didn't think
it was gonna be that big of a deal.

49:15.500 --> 49:18.200
Oh, honey, it's her first date.
Big deal doesn't even start.

49:18.600 --> 49:21.000
It's not like I didn't try.

49:24.300 --> 49:26.200
- I bought her a nice dress.
- Nice?

49:26.500 --> 49:31.500
- Pilgrims wore sexier outfits.
- She's 13, okay?

49:31.900 --> 49:35.700
- Sexy isn't on the menu.
- Okay, is this about the dress?

49:38.300 --> 49:39.500
No, it's a little bit worse.

49:40.100 --> 49:41.300
Worse than that outfit?

49:42.200 --> 49:43.700
Bobbie, did you want to come out?

49:44.000 --> 49:46.200
No, I can't be seen in public.

49:46.500 --> 49:49.500
- Ever.
- It's probably not as bad as you think.

49:55.300 --> 49:59.100
I took her to the beauty parlor.
They gave her a perm.

50:00.600 --> 50:01.600
Maybe a couple of bows?

50:02.200 --> 50:03.300
Scarves are in these days.

50:03.600 --> 50:05.600
- Oh, yeah, good idea, Trudy.
- Ted, I can help.

50:05.900 --> 50:08.200
But Bobbie will have to come with me.
Is that okay?

50:08.900 --> 50:11.400
- Yeah.
- Bobbie, trust me.

50:11.700 --> 50:13.700
Get in the car.

50:14.000 --> 50:16.600
And put your little hat back on.

50:35.700 --> 50:39.100
Ladies, can we talk shoes?

50:42.800 --> 50:43.900
They're heels.

50:44.200 --> 50:47.000
Little ones. That's okay, right?

50:47.300 --> 50:49.800
My first heels.

50:50.400 --> 50:52.800
But they ain't
gonna wear themselves.

50:57.200 --> 50:58.400
They're perfect.

50:59.600 --> 51:01.900
She like Cinderella and shit.

51:07.500 --> 51:10.400
May I present
Miss Roberta Mitchell.

51:20.300 --> 51:23.800
Bobbie, you... You look just like...

51:26.800 --> 51:28.300
You're so beautiful.

51:36.600 --> 51:39.400
Good evening, Mr. Mitchell.

51:40.500 --> 51:41.600
Hi, Waylon.

51:41.800 --> 51:44.100
Wow, Bobs, you look hot.

51:44.400 --> 51:46.100
- The hell she does.
- Here.

51:46.400 --> 51:48.700
That's my little girl.
There's nothing hot about her.

51:49.000 --> 51:50.700
Gee, thanks, Dad.

51:52.900 --> 51:55.900
You know, I was 14 once too.

51:56.200 --> 52:00.200
So I know all about what's going
through your head right now.

52:02.300 --> 52:03.300
And your pants.

52:03.500 --> 52:04.900
Daddy.

52:05.200 --> 52:06.800
Come on, your mom's waiting.

52:07.100 --> 52:09.100
- Okay.
- Hey, hey, hey.

52:09.900 --> 52:11.800
You're gonna have her home
by 10:30, right?

52:12.100 --> 52:14.100
- Yeah.
- Okay, hey, hey, listen.

52:14.400 --> 52:16.800
I want you to remember something.

52:17.900 --> 52:22.600
Whatever you do to my daughter,
I do to you.

52:27.500 --> 52:30.500
I think what your father meant to say
is go and have a good time.

52:30.800 --> 52:33.400
That's not what I meant, actually.

52:33.700 --> 52:34.900
That's not what I said.

52:37.200 --> 52:39.100
That is so not what I meant at all.

52:40.200 --> 52:41.600
Are you okay?

52:41.900 --> 52:44.900
Oh, I'm fine.

52:45.200 --> 52:47.600
I'm fine. I'm just...

52:49.200 --> 52:50.700
I'm old.

52:51.000 --> 52:54.200
My daughter is starting to date,
you know? How did that happen?

52:54.500 --> 52:55.600
I don't feel so good.

52:55.900 --> 52:58.800
I'm gonna just sit down for a minute.
I can't feel my feet.

52:59.800 --> 53:01.300
Yeah.

53:02.900 --> 53:04.300
I think I'm having a stroke.

53:05.800 --> 53:09.200
You know what?
I might be having a heart attack too.

53:09.500 --> 53:11.200
Because my hands, they're numb.

53:11.500 --> 53:14.600
Is it your left hand or your right hand
with a heart attack?

53:14.900 --> 53:17.000
I can't remember which hand it is.

53:21.000 --> 53:23.500
So how did you know
I wasn't having a heart attack?

53:23.800 --> 53:28.100
Because I've seen this thing before.
My father was very overprotective.

53:28.500 --> 53:31.800
So I guess this isn't how you planned
on spending your Saturday.

53:32.100 --> 53:36.800
You know, nothing about Minnesota
has fallen into what I planned.

53:37.200 --> 53:38.800
I hear you.

53:41.800 --> 53:45.100
You know,
I used to go to the factory a lot.

53:45.500 --> 53:48.600
Outside of Miami, with my dad.

53:48.900 --> 53:51.400
He knew everything about it,
inside and out.

53:51.700 --> 53:53.600
Even the guys in the suits
would ask him...

53:53.900 --> 53:55.400
...how to get things done,
you know?

53:57.300 --> 53:59.500
I thought he was the boss.

54:01.300 --> 54:03.200
I was really surprised.

54:07.500 --> 54:10.100
He did maintenance at the plant.

54:10.400 --> 54:14.100
You know, he really drilled that
into my head. That...

54:14.500 --> 54:15.800
You know, get an education...

54:16.000 --> 54:19.000
...and it's the only thing
that people can't take away from you.

54:19.400 --> 54:21.400
Work hard
and do what needs to be done...

54:21.700 --> 54:27.500
...and maybe one day
you'll be the boss of a place like this.

54:29.600 --> 54:30.600
Ironic, isn't it?

54:33.800 --> 54:35.500
And how about you?

54:36.500 --> 54:39.100
How did you end up in New Ulm?

54:41.600 --> 54:43.000
The Mayo Clinic.

54:47.200 --> 54:51.500
- The Mayo Clinic?
- It's just a few miles from here.

54:52.800 --> 54:57.600
I was born in North Carolina,
and I went to school in Auburn.

54:58.100 --> 55:00.400
I met my wife, Brenda, there.

55:02.600 --> 55:04.900
It's funny, I say my wife.

55:05.200 --> 55:08.300
And even though it's been,
what, six years...

55:08.700 --> 55:11.300
...I still feel like she just ran out...

55:11.600 --> 55:13.900
...to the store to get something,
you know?

55:20.900 --> 55:26.100
She was diagnosed
with a degenerative heart defect.

55:27.400 --> 55:32.800
And they had this program at the clinic
and that became our life really.

55:33.400 --> 55:35.200
Trips to the clinic.

55:36.700 --> 55:39.900
When the phone rang,
I'd just hold my breath.

55:47.400 --> 55:49.600
Did you ever think about
moving back South?

55:51.600 --> 55:54.700
This was really the only home
that Bobbie ever knew...

55:55.100 --> 55:57.500
...and she'd just lost her mama.

55:57.800 --> 55:59.800
And it didn't seem fair for her...

56:00.100 --> 56:03.000
...to lose her home and her friends
and her school and all that.

56:03.300 --> 56:04.600
So...

56:47.100 --> 56:49.500
- What time is it?
- I don't know.

57:10.800 --> 57:14.200
Well, you're finally home. Because
all I've done is sit here and worry.

57:14.500 --> 57:16.300
It's not even 10:30.

57:16.600 --> 57:18.000
Lucy, you're still here?

57:19.400 --> 57:23.300
Well, I had to make sure he didn't get
the shotgun out if you were late.

57:26.600 --> 57:29.800
And now that I've seen to that...

57:30.200 --> 57:32.800
Did you have a good time?
Was it fun?

57:35.100 --> 57:36.300
It was all right.

57:37.000 --> 57:40.900
You know, I'm really sorry
about getting all weird on you earlier.

57:41.200 --> 57:43.700
It's okay.
I guess Ginny Linstrom's dad...

57:44.000 --> 57:46.100
...gave the same creepy lecture
to Cliffie Morgan.

57:51.100 --> 57:53.900
Thank you for everything.

57:58.500 --> 58:00.100
- Good night.
- Good night.

58:00.400 --> 58:01.900
Good night.

58:32.800 --> 58:33.800
We're not as far...

58:34.100 --> 58:36.400
...on the automation and downsizing
as we had hoped.

58:36.700 --> 58:40.900
That's because the robotic arms
are still in some warehouse in Japan.

58:41.600 --> 58:44.400
If we start to downsize, we're not
gonna have the workforce...

58:44.700 --> 58:46.700
<i>...for installation.
- This is costing us money.</i>

58:47.000 --> 58:48.500
I understand.

58:48.800 --> 58:50.600
I will keep you apprised.

58:50.900 --> 58:53.800
<i>- We'll talk next week then.
- All right.</i>

58:54.500 --> 58:56.000
Goodbye.

58:59.400 --> 59:01.600
<i>- Lucy Hill.
- Hey, Lucy, it's Ted.</i>

59:01.900 --> 59:03.700
Listen, I have this idea for Saturday.

59:04.000 --> 59:08.200
I was thinking I could
pick you up around 8 in the morning.

59:09.300 --> 59:11.600
Yeah, wear something
you can get dirty, okay?

59:11.900 --> 59:13.900
Something dirty?

59:18.500 --> 59:20.000
- Hey.
- Hi.

59:20.700 --> 59:23.200
You...
You might wanna put these on.

59:24.000 --> 59:25.600
What is it?

59:26.500 --> 59:28.400
Crow hunting.

59:30.000 --> 59:33.800
- But I don't wanna shoot a crow.
- You don't have to shoot a crow.

59:34.100 --> 59:35.300
You can just shoot at them.

59:35.600 --> 59:40.400
It's a chance for you to get out,
you know, befriend the locals.

59:51.000 --> 59:55.200
Stu. What's the chance of me
running into you out here?

59:55.600 --> 59:57.100
Holy balls, why did you bring her?

59:57.400 --> 59:59.800
She said she wanted to get out,
do a little shooting.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.300
Shooting?

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.700
You even got shells there, girlie?

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.700
Yeah. Yeah, I've got shells.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:10.200
Oh, it's a great day.

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:16.000
Almost.

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:23.500
Okay, that's it. I gotta...

01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:25.700
- What?
- I need to...

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:30.800
- What are you talking about?
- I need to pee.

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:37.300
You're kidding me, right?

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:40.300
Oh, for crying
in the beer-cheese soup.

01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:43.100
Are you such a city girl
you can't pee outside?

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:47.700
You see, Stu, that's just one
of the advantages of being a city girl.

01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:49.000
You don't have to.

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:52.900
Don't let the badgers
bite you in the ass.

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:55.300
Badgers? Really?

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:57.800
Is he serious?

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:04.600
Just in case.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:41.100
Oh, come on.

01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:54.000
Ted!

01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:00.100
Okay, where is it?
Where is it, where is it, where is it?

01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:02.700
Where, where, where? Okay.

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:11.300
What?

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:15.300
You can really show a girl
a good time, you know?

01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:18.000
I'm trying to give you a chance
to patch things up...

01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:19.900
...if you would be a sport about it.

01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:21.500
I'm being a sport.

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:23.600
But just... I'm stuck.

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:26.100
Then talk to him about fishing.
He loves fishing...

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:28.500
No, no, no,
I'm not stuck for conversation.

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:32.900
- I'm stuck in your stupid overalls.
- All right, hold on.

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:41.800
Turn around.

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:45.400
Don't move.

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:50.000
Stop moving.

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:54.000
Okay, hold on, hold on.

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:57.200
Hold on a second.
Hold on, hold on.

01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:58.900
I got it.

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.500
Oh, that's not good.

01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:09.900
- Turn around.
- Okay.

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:11.400
- No, wait...
- For real.

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:13.700
- What are you gonna do?
- Bend over.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.500
- What are you gonna do?
- Bend over.

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:16.900
Oh, okay, okay.

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:20.500
- Bend over.
- Hurry, just hurry.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.000
Cool.

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.800
You could have just cut the zipper.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.100
- Are you wearing a thong?
- You said something dirty.

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:34.300
I said what? I said wear something
you can get dirty.

01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:36.000
Just go.

01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:39.500
And don't watch. Go. Go.

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:41.500
Go!

01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:00.400
- I'll be damned.
- I'm not really certain about that.

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:02.300
I did hear they knew each other...

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:03.900
Sorry there, pal.

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:05.900
I didn't figure her for much of a shot.

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:09.200
Can you give me word
about Ted's condition?

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:12.900
<i>Yes, I understand
it's a lower body injury.</i>

01:04:13.300 --> 01:04:16.700
<i>Somewhere around
the buttock area.</i>

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.800
<i>Some said the shooting
might be a lover's vendetta...</i>

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:22.500
<i>...or that the woman is deranged.</i>

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:28.200
Oh, that's great.
The lead story on the news is my ass.

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:35.800
So you should sign off
on the spring mount there.

01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:37.700
All right.

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:49.700
Very good.

01:04:58.100 --> 01:04:59.800
Bobbie.

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.600
How you doing?

01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:18.900
- I'm okay, how are you doing?
- Okay.

01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:21.200
You baked?

01:05:21.900 --> 01:05:24.300
Yes, I don't really bake...

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:27.800
...but it seems to be the thing
that people do around here.

01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:32.100
- I'm sorry, again.
- Oh, cake.

01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:35.300
- Now you decide to show up?
- Hi, Bobbie.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.300
- I think that means she forgives you.
- Okay.

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:43.900
Why don't you come in?

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:47.500
Mr. Arling on the line.

01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:49.700
Oh, good.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.100
Hey, did you look over the proposal?

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:55.700
I know I can work
with the existing equipment.

01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:00.600
What do you mean, no product line?

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.700
You can't just decide like that.
I need to be in that meeting.

01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:08.500
I understand.

01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:10.500
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:15.600
Blanche, I need to get
on the first flight to Miami.

01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:21.700
I'm gonna need
my alternate production figures.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.200
They'll be in the confidential file
in my desk.

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:26.200
The key is in the center drawer.

01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:29.900
<i>- Okey-dokey artichokie.
- Thank you.</i>

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:07.700
The Rocket Bars test markets
are tanking.

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.400
We're dumping the product line.

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:12.100
And the plant.

01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:15.400
Because it's worth more
to this company dead than alive.

01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:17.100
Well, I disagree.

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:19.400
- That would be a terrible mistake.
- Lucy.

01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:21.500
The people of New Ulm
are hardworking...

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:25.000
...and they could create an opportunity
that we should take advantage of.

01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:26.900
Rocket Bars were the opportunity.

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:29.200
Well, then we'll reformulate
and rename them.

01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:31.100
And we'll strategize with...

01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:33.700
The product line is dead,
and so is the plant.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.400
We can't just write
these people's livelihoods off.

01:07:36.700 --> 01:07:38.000
Lucy.

01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:40.700
That's enough.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
We need a timetable for shutdown.

01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:48.700
We'll keep a skeleton crew on...

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.900
...until we move any remaining
physical assets off-site.

01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:22.700
Blanche.

01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:26.800
You never said anything about layoffs.

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:29.300
Oh, no.

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:31.700
I made that a long time ago.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.700
I made that list
before I even knew you.

01:08:33.899 --> 01:08:36.800
And that's okay? It's okay
to pull the rug out from under folks...

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:39.300
...as long as it's nobody
that you know?

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:42.300
It's okay because we're just
silly Podunk Minnesotans, right?

01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:44.800
We talk funny and we ice-fish
and we scrapbook...

01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:48.300
...and we drag Jesus
into regular conversation.

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:52.600
We're not cool like you, right?
So we don't matter.

01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:58.200
And it's okay to lie as long as you're
just pretending to be my friend.

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:02.800
I didn't lie. I just didn't tell you.

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:06.000
Well, I mean it is the same thing.

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:09.100
I guess I lied.

01:09:09.899 --> 01:09:13.700
But I wasn't pretending, Blanche.
You are my friend.

01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.500
Folks need to know, you know?

01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:20.399
They need to be able to file protests
with the union.

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:25.100
- Ted.
- I had to tell him.

01:09:25.399 --> 01:09:28.399
Maybe you can keep
that kind of thing secret, but I can't.

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:32.600
Blanche, it gets so much worse.

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:34.800
Oh, yeah, what could be worse?

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:41.399
I just found out in Miami
that they wanna close the plant.

01:09:45.399 --> 01:09:48.100
I know that this is gonna sound
like a hollow promise to you...

01:09:48.399 --> 01:09:51.000
...but I'm determined
to figure something out.

01:09:51.300 --> 01:09:54.200
I really am. I mean,
there has to be something, right?

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:59.300
I just... You just can't eliminate
people's livelihoods, you know?

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:03.200
Sure you can.
It happens all the time.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.700
Look, this doesn't mean
that we're friends or anything...

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.600
...but when I get upset, I cook.

01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:18.200
And right now, me and Harve
are up to our ears in tapioca.

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:20.100
So there you go, okay?

01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:48.400
Ted.

01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:56.100
Is it true?

01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:02.500
Then we ain't got nothing to say.

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:52.800
Don't leave.

01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:57.900
- Please, I need you here.
- To type pink slips?

01:11:58.300 --> 01:12:01.300
Besides what's another couple
of months gonna make a difference?

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:03.600
I hope so.

01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:07.500
Hey, let's talk tapioca.

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:09.900
Okay.

01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:13.800
Go ahead.

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:37.900
Hi there.

01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:40.700
We're doing market research today
on a new product...

01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:46.100
...called Power Pack Protein Pudding
with Fortified Zappy-oca.

01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:50.700
That's your fourth sample already.
That's enough Zappy-oca for you.

01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:53.200
Keep them coming, Lucy.
It's like a stampede.

01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:57.000
Go ahead.
If you like it, just put in "I like it".

01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:59.500
Put a little nutmeg on top if you like.

01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:01.500
And if you don't like, don't do it.

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:07.700
<i>Every lassie, a champion skier
of the first water.</i>

01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:14.700
<i>That's called the forward squat.</i>

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000
What the hell are you doing here?

01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:24.600
I'm here to see Stu.

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:27.000
What the hell are you doing here,
Flo?

01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:29.100
I live here.

01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:32.700
Hey, Stanley.

01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:35.400
Annie Oakley's here.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.600
You and Flo.

01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:42.100
Yeah, no...

01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:47.900
Yeah, she's my ex-wife
and this is my ex-house.

01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:52.000
And now I pay rent
to live in my ex-basement.

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:56.000
Ain't that a kick in the keister?

01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:01.600
So let's get back to that part
about you giving me my old job back.

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:05.100
Corporate is shutting down
the plant.

01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:09.800
Goddang...

01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:12.800
- But...
- I knew this was gonna happen.

01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:15.300
- I have a plan.
- What is going on down there?

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:18.700
None of your damn business,
you nosy old hoot owl!

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:28.500
We've come up with a new product.

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:31.400
If we can produce it
and test-market it in four weeks...

01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:35.400
...well, then we can prove to corporate
that this plant is still worthwhile.

01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:37.700
A month?

01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:43.800
What? That's impossible.

01:14:45.900 --> 01:14:49.500
I mean, you're just gonna get
everybody's hopes up...

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:51.900
...and then they'll all end up
out of work anyway.

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:56.900
- See, I think...
- No, I am not taking the fall for that.

01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:00.400
You're on your own, lady.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.900
So that's the plan,
and to make it work...

01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:24.300
...we're gonna recommission
the old-fashioned yogurt equipment.

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:26.200
It's gonna take a lot of long hours.

01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:28.900
How much overtime
are you authorized for?

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:30.200
None.

01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:32.000
And if the Munck-ees don't buy it?

01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:36.600
We'll put in a whole lot of work
and end up out on our asses anyway.

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:40.800
Yeah, yeah, I'm not gonna lie to you.
The odds are that's what will happen.

01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:42.500
But if it's any consolation...

01:15:42.800 --> 01:15:46.400
...I'm gonna be out of a job
right alongside the rest of you.

01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:50.300
I mean,
I am betting my career on this.

01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:53.900
Why? I don't know.

01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:56.100
When I came here
did I think that this...

01:15:56.300 --> 01:15:58.600
...was gonna matter this much? No.

01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:02.600
But does it matter? Yeah.

01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:06.900
Yeah, absolutely. It matters a lot.

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:16.200
And you can sure betcha we'll be out
on our asses if we don't try.

01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:21.100
You got something
better to do there, Lars?

01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:24.400
And I gotta say I don't exactly
picture prospective employers...

01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:27.300
...lining up to fight over
a dumb son of a bitch like Bob.

01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:38.000
They might padlock this place,
let the whole town come to rust.

01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:43.000
But if that's the way it goes,
I don't wanna be thinking...

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:47.500
...this gal offered a chance
and I didn't do a thing about it.

01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:52.300
You can count me in.

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:40.100
They teach you that
in your management books?

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:45.200
Is this a surprise compliance visit
from the union?

01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:48.700
Maybe.
I heard about what you're doing.

01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:58.300
Look, I'm not sure why I came here,
but maybe I can help.

01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:12.400
Crank it a little bit more.
Yup, crank it, a little bit more.

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:16.200
All right, Bob, turn her on.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.700
Hold it. Turn her off, Bob.

01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:22.100
- Great.
- Hang on, trade me spots here, Ted.

01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:23.900
Okay, go on, get in there.

01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:27.200
- Okay, let's do this other one.
- All right.

01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:29.000
Turn it on, please.

01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:31.300
Put it off, Bob.

01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:36.000
That's funny?

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.800
- No, no, no.
- Yeah, that's funny though.

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:42.500
Yeah, all right.
Bob, do me a favor, please turn it on.

01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:10.600
And I swear never to reveal
Blanche's secret tapioca recipe...

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:16.800
...to anyone from a rival company
or to Trudy Van Uuden.

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:20.300
I swear.

01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:10.800
Mr. Arling
from the home office on line one.

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.400
And if you ask me,
he doesn't sound any too pleased.

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:24.500
Donald, funny you should call.

01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:45.900
Yes, yes, Donald.

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:50.600
I do realize that I did this
with absolutely no authorization.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.300
Don't think I'm not pissed.

01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:55.800
You'd be out on your ass if those
regional tests weren't off the charts.

01:20:56.100 --> 01:21:00.000
It doesn't hurt that Wallace's
grandkids are big on the butterscotch.

01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:03.900
This is Blanche Gunderson.

01:21:04.100 --> 01:21:05.700
She's our head
of Product Development.

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.600
Oh, heavens no, I'm just...

01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:11.300
Oh, I'm pleased as punch
to meet you.

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:13.400
- Yeah.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:15.400
- It's all right, it's okay.
- Oh, dear.

01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:17.300
Yeah, yeah.

01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:21.500
Well, they never would have thought
it would be more cost-effective...

01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:26.300
...to use the current labor force and
the old machine line than robotics...

01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:28.600
...but we showed them.

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:30.300
They want to ramp up production...

01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:33.500
...and ship nationally
by the end of the month.

01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:41.700
How does it feel
to be the newest vice president?

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:44.600
We'll expect you in Miami
next week.

01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:04.200
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:06.000
- How you doing?
- I'm all right.

01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:09.000
- How are you?
- I'm all right.

01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:11.800
It's real noisy in there so...

01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:16.500
I thought I'd tell you goodbye
out here.

01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:23.100
You know, you've done some
pretty amazing things around here.

01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:25.300
Thank you.

01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:31.700
Everybody in this whole town
is really gonna miss you a lot.

01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:37.900
Especially me.

01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:48.800
There's people in there
waiting to give you a sendoff.

01:22:49.100 --> 01:22:52.300
You don't want to miss that.
You may wanna...

01:22:54.700 --> 01:22:56.400
Yeah.

01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:16.100
- So I'll see you...
- Yeah, I'll be in there in a while.

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:18.600
Okay.

01:23:53.500 --> 01:23:56.200
It'll be nice getting back
to civilization.

01:23:57.100 --> 01:23:58.900
How do people live here?

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:53.100
How many queens
did you plant in this deck, Maurice?

01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:56.000
Four or five, give or take a couple.

01:25:57.600 --> 01:25:59.100
Hey, fellas.

01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:03.100
Ted, we gotta talk.

01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:09.800
Hey, Nina,
give me a Maker's Mark.

01:26:13.100 --> 01:26:17.600
Well, it looks like we're just
too successful for our own damn good.

01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:22.100
Just got wind from Fagerbache
in Distribution, the plant's being sold.

01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:25.800
Some muckety-muck from HQ
is coming to tell us about it.

01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:27.500
Sold?

01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:29.500
Yeah, it's a heck of a deal.

01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:32.200
They're gonna move
our product line out of here.

01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:35.200
Faster than thin shit
through a tall Swede.

01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:38.400
I'm surprised your little sweetie-pie
vice president...

01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:41.000
...didn't send you the memo.

01:26:56.100 --> 01:26:57.300
So ridiculous.

01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:00.800
It was my secret, now it's being
shipped off with the plant.

01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:15.600
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna accept
anything less...

01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.900
...than two weeks' salary
for every year worked.

01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:50.600
I understand that you've heard...

01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:54.200
...of Munck Foods' planned sale
of this facility.

01:27:54.900 --> 01:27:56.300
Yeah.

01:27:58.300 --> 01:28:01.700
Well, I've assembled
some industrial investors...

01:28:02.500 --> 01:28:06.300
...to back us in buying this plant,
product line and all.

01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:09.300
At a fixed rate,
you'll buy the new company back...

01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:13.400
...until it is entirely owner-operated.

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:17.400
Well, how do we know
we can we trust these guys?

01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:18.900
Yeah.

01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.700
You won't have to.

01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:24.900
You can trust me.

01:28:26.700 --> 01:28:30.500
I wanna come back
as this company's CEO.

01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:33.800
Well, would you look at Miss CEO?

01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:37.400
As I recall, first,
you got us to risk everything.

01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:41.400
Then you left us behind, you know?

01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:44.600
And then you got them...

01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:47.300
...to buy the company
out right from under our feet.

01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:49.900
And now you have this idea...

01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:52.600
...about how we're supposed
to buy our own company back.

01:28:52.900 --> 01:28:54.300
Well, that changes everything.

01:28:57.100 --> 01:29:00.000
Are you prepared
to deal with the union on this?

01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:10.000
I'm sure we could come
to some agreement.

01:29:10.900 --> 01:29:14.300
It's gonna take a little bit of time too,
it might take years.

01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:21.700
My schedule's open.

01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:36.500
- Whoa, there, buddy, you're not...
- Hey, I just have something in my eye.

01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:38.200
Damn it.

01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:18.700
Now...

01:30:19.500 --> 01:30:21.300
What about Johann Weinkopf?

01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:24.300
Why, he'd make you
a mighty fine husband.

01:30:24.600 --> 01:30:25.500
He's got a lazy eye.

01:30:25.700 --> 01:30:29.800
And I can never tell if he's looking
directly at me or my breast.

01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:32.300
Probably looking at both.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.400
Now that I think about it,
you're probably right.

01:30:35.900 --> 01:30:37.100
Go on.

01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:40.500
- Oh, hi there, Peter.
- Here you go.

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.500
- So...
- Okay, then.

01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:50.700
- You have a nice day.
- Enjoy the weather.

01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:52.800
- You too.
- Thank you much.
