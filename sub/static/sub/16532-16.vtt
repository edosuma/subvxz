00:09.033 --> 00:10.482
You're right. It's not that b...

00:10.507 --> 00:11.773
Aah!

00:11.842 --> 00:15.144
One year ago today, I had
the chance to be a hero.

00:15.213 --> 00:17.246
It was the annual high school
charity basketball game...

00:17.315 --> 00:19.114
parents versus teachers.

00:19.184 --> 00:20.716
We were raising money for Mrs. Martin

00:20.785 --> 00:24.419
in the attendance office who
lost her house in a mudslide.

00:24.488 --> 00:26.954
One minute it was present,
the next it was absent.

00:27.023 --> 00:30.011
<i>Down 2, a second left, I was fouled.</i>

00:30.036 --> 00:32.644
<i>The game was in my hands.</i>

00:33.630 --> 00:35.564
(crowd groans)

00:35.632 --> 00:36.998
<i>I crumbled under the pressure.</i>

00:37.067 --> 00:39.734
I've waited a year for
my shot at redemption

00:39.803 --> 00:41.246
and left nothing to chance.

00:41.271 --> 00:42.336
Harder!

00:42.361 --> 00:44.738
<i>I have worked out like a madman...</i>

00:44.815 --> 00:48.250
<i>passing and dribbling
drills, agility training...</i>

00:48.311 --> 00:50.184
- (stopwatch beeps)
- <i>... and I top it all off</i>

00:50.209 --> 00:52.271
<i>with 100 free throws every day...</i>

00:52.295 --> 00:54.160
23. 24.

00:54.185 --> 00:56.356
<i>... no matter how tired I am.</i>

00:57.734 --> 00:59.934
(yawns) 85.

01:00.567 --> 01:03.867
<i>It had been a year of painful
training, but I was ready.</i>

01:03.952 --> 01:05.434

Don't tell Mama?

What about, "Don't tell Papa?"

01:27.175 --> 01:29.375
A boy is supposed to fear his father.

I shook in my boots around my old man,

Hola, Donna.

02:12.817 --> 02:14.250
Did you wander in by mistake?

02:14.319 --> 02:16.054
You know they don't sell shoes here.

02:16.079 --> 02:18.621
Oh, no, I see you buy a lot of hot dogs.

02:18.690 --> 02:21.123
It's so sad when someone just gives up.

money to get her a new kidney

So, can we count on you?

02:30.058 --> 02:31.425
For the kidney?

02:31.494 --> 02:32.994
To write a check,

02:33.019 --> 02:34.814
- like you always do.
- (laughing) Yes.

Money is almost as good as
actually doing something.

03:26.273 --> 03:29.274
I knew that deal was

03:29.343 --> 03:31.387
And now I'm gonna look

03:33.780 --> 03:35.312
(British accent) A spot of tea, sir?

03:35.382 --> 03:37.248
(British accent) Only
if it's the fancy kind.

03:37.316 --> 03:38.416
(normal voice) Oh, my God.

03:38.485 --> 03:39.650
How good have our accents gotten?

03:39.719 --> 03:41.285
- (normal voice) It's insane.
- Yeah.

03:41.354 --> 03:44.121
When Haley was 4, she and
I had our first tea party,

03:44.190 --> 03:46.424
and since then, we've
made it a tradition

03:46.493 --> 03:48.312
to meet for high tea once a year.

03:48.337 --> 03:50.627
It's a time I've really come to cherish.

03:50.696 --> 03:52.028
I don't love the whole tea thing.

03:52.097 --> 03:53.930
Mitchell and Haley
always come back giggling

03:53.999 --> 03:57.868
over shared secrets,
and I feel left out.

03:57.936 --> 04:02.171
I once tried to start my own
uncle-niece tradition, but...

04:02.240 --> 04:03.607
I'm not questioning the methodology

04:03.675 --> 04:05.353
behind accelerated mass spectrometry.

04:05.378 --> 04:07.186
I'm merely pointing out
that it's not singular

04:07.211 --> 04:09.111
in its power to separate a rare isotope

04:09.179 --> 04:11.046
from an abundant neighboring mass.

04:11.115 --> 04:14.082
What's going on with you
and that handsome weatherman?

04:14.151 --> 04:16.719
- Things are great, mostly. Yeah.
- Mm!

04:16.788 --> 04:18.053
Oh. "Mostly"?

04:18.122 --> 04:19.755
Well, what's... what's going on?

04:19.839 --> 04:23.306
I mean, do you think it's okay...

04:23.359 --> 04:26.756
for your partner to ask
you to do... anything?

04:26.781 --> 04:29.263
Mm, no. Not <i> anything</i> anything.

04:29.332 --> 04:30.896
I mean, we all have our boundaries.

04:30.921 --> 04:33.034
I mean, there are still things
I wouldn't ask Cam to do.

04:33.059 --> 04:34.804
Okay. So, um,

04:34.829 --> 04:37.371
Rainer and I were in bed
the other night, and...

04:37.441 --> 04:38.973
And?

04:39.042 --> 04:40.689
He asked me to do something

04:40.714 --> 04:42.639
I'm not totally comfortable with.

04:42.664 --> 04:44.955
What'd he ask you to do?

04:44.980 --> 04:47.459
No... no judgments. Just
whenever you're ready.

04:47.484 --> 04:49.349
So, he was lying on his side,

04:49.418 --> 04:50.884
and he said that that was part of it,

04:50.953 --> 04:53.587
and then he asked me to c...

04:53.656 --> 04:54.922
Haley!

04:54.990 --> 04:56.923
What'd he ask you to do? Quick,
write it down on this napkin.

04:56.991 --> 04:58.448
Rainer, what are you doing here?

04:58.473 --> 05:00.243
Uh, you left your earbuds in my car.

05:00.268 --> 05:01.899
I know you like to use
them to ignore people.

05:01.924 --> 05:03.737
Aww! Do you want to join us?

05:03.762 --> 05:05.151
You don't mind, do you, Uncle Mitch?

05:05.176 --> 05:07.090
No!

05:11.717 --> 05:13.693
Feels weird to be back here.

05:13.748 --> 05:15.717
This gym got the better of me once.

05:15.742 --> 05:18.418
- Dad, you're psyching yourself out.
- You're right.

05:18.443 --> 05:20.529
The only thing different
between this year and last

05:20.554 --> 05:22.320
is I'm prepared this year.

05:22.560 --> 05:26.129
And DeAndre Jordan and
Charles Barkley are here.

05:26.535 --> 05:28.493
Is this where we get our hand stamped?

05:28.538 --> 05:30.745
Sometimes I like to leave
and come back to things.

05:30.840 --> 05:33.307
Uh, why... why are you here?

05:33.376 --> 05:35.509
Our agent's wife is a
math teacher at the school.

05:35.577 --> 05:36.676
Let's go get our seats.

05:36.745 --> 05:38.177
We don't want anybody to block us.

05:38.246 --> 05:41.144
Yeah, yeah. I... I get that.

05:41.650 --> 05:43.517
So, I'm playing in
front of two NBA stars?

05:43.585 --> 05:45.485
Plus, once people know they're here,

05:45.554 --> 05:47.521
the crowd will be like five
times the size it was last year.

05:47.589 --> 05:49.956
Well, we still live in a
world with a fire marshal.

05:50.025 --> 05:51.918
Wait. They're probably just
here to show their faces

05:51.943 --> 05:53.816
and make a quick exit.

05:54.105 --> 05:55.961
Dad, don't let them faze you.

05:56.030 --> 05:57.484
This is what you've trained for.

05:57.509 --> 05:59.478
- You're ready.
- You're right.

05:59.503 --> 06:01.656
I just need to shake the
jitters off a little bit.

06:01.681 --> 06:03.068
I got you, Larry.

06:03.137 --> 06:04.407
Spot up.

06:04.602 --> 06:06.046
No!

06:06.071 --> 06:08.782
Gloria? Is that you?

06:08.978 --> 06:12.243
My brain's having a hard time
processing you in this context.

06:12.311 --> 06:15.402
Yeah, I came to sell my
nachos to raise money.

06:15.427 --> 06:16.827
- How nice.
- Mm-hmm.

06:16.852 --> 06:19.551
Although, some people are
saying it's too little too late,

06:19.619 --> 06:22.719
that you can't just show
up and get credit for it.

06:22.744 --> 06:23.844
I think it's mean,

06:23.869 --> 06:26.357
but some people are saying
it seems disingenuous.

06:26.382 --> 06:27.434
I just got here.

06:27.459 --> 06:29.059
When did you talk to all these people?

06:29.127 --> 06:30.594
I think you'll find this crowd

06:30.663 --> 06:32.368
no lika da nachos.

06:32.393 --> 06:34.549
- I'm sorry if that sounds racist.
- No, it didn't.

06:34.574 --> 06:38.078
I don't even know what language
you were trying to make fun of.

06:38.103 --> 06:40.065
Okay, since you're not leaving,

06:40.090 --> 06:41.830
- you can set up down there.
- Ah.

06:41.893 --> 06:43.018
No.

06:43.043 --> 06:45.575
It's very dark, and it's very far away!

06:45.643 --> 06:47.409
Good luck!

06:47.478 --> 06:49.879
Looks like that picture I
Instagrammed of the three of us

06:49.948 --> 06:51.747
- is a big hit with Rainer Nation.
- Oh!

06:51.816 --> 06:53.683
And is it safe to post
your location like that?

06:53.751 --> 06:56.312
- Aren't you worried about stalkers?
- Oh, no, it's fine.

06:56.337 --> 06:59.154
Most of my followers are just overly
excited, love-starved old ladies.

06:59.223 --> 07:01.823
Oh, I see your exclusive
tea party opened up.

07:01.892 --> 07:03.058
He just posted that.

07:03.126 --> 07:04.759
What, are you circling the restaurant?

07:04.828 --> 07:07.495
- Hey, Rainer Shine.
- You sat next to him at Thanksgiving.

07:07.564 --> 07:09.564
Right! Manny! Sit down. Join us.

07:09.633 --> 07:12.595
Actually, Cam, could I
talk to you for a second?

07:12.903 --> 07:14.936
Okay, before Rainer walked in,

07:15.005 --> 07:16.710
Haley was about to tell
me something upsetting

07:16.735 --> 07:18.524
he asked her to do in the bedroom.

07:18.549 --> 07:19.587
(gasps)

07:19.627 --> 07:22.759
Now, I didn't get much,
but he asked her to c...

07:22.812 --> 07:23.911
To what?

07:23.980 --> 07:25.212
He asked her to c...

07:25.280 --> 07:26.484
Are you kidding me?

07:26.509 --> 07:28.649
Okay, no one else come
near us. Thank you.

07:28.674 --> 07:31.103
That's all she got out... "c..."

07:31.128 --> 07:32.443
And then Rainer walked in.

07:32.488 --> 07:34.088
Well, we have to find out.

07:34.156 --> 07:36.422
As her uncles, we need
all the information we can

07:36.491 --> 07:37.924
so we can advise her properly.

07:37.993 --> 07:39.225
Yeah. She's dating an older man.

07:39.293 --> 07:41.794
If she's uncomfortable,
it's our duty to protect her.

07:41.863 --> 07:43.262
Okay. So we said all that.

07:43.331 --> 07:45.131
- What could be "c..." be?
- Hmm?

07:45.199 --> 07:46.396
- Carrot?
- Mnh-mnh.

07:46.421 --> 07:47.466
Cupping?

07:47.535 --> 07:48.694
(gasp)

07:48.719 --> 07:50.313
You don't think it could be
a Canadian long jump, do you?

07:50.338 --> 07:52.694
What part would a woman play in that?

07:55.408 --> 07:57.876
- That's the last of the paper trail.
- Great.

07:57.901 --> 07:59.799
Okay, and so the red pins on this map

07:59.824 --> 08:01.680
mark all the locations of closets

08:01.749 --> 08:03.214
that were made with the toxic wood.

08:03.283 --> 08:04.893
Okay, and we have recalled

08:04.918 --> 08:06.384
9 out of 10 of the contaminated closets,

08:06.453 --> 08:07.686
so we only have to track down one more.

08:07.755 --> 08:09.219
And since you didn't ask, the green pins

08:09.272 --> 08:12.006
are all the addresses of
potential fathers of mine.

08:12.623 --> 08:14.659
Oh, hey. How're you doing?

08:14.727 --> 08:18.198
Did I hear somebody using my
shredder without signing it out?

08:18.223 --> 08:20.502
- No.
- Confetti!

08:20.527 --> 08:22.633
- Hey!
- The kid doesn't fear me as he should,

08:22.702 --> 08:24.441
so I brought him in here to
show him my scary boss side.

08:24.466 --> 08:25.469
- Play along.
- Okay.

08:25.538 --> 08:27.809
- Ben, how dumb do you think I am?
- You found out?

08:27.834 --> 08:29.362
Of course I found out.
I know everything.

08:29.407 --> 08:30.406
(scoffs) It was her idea!

08:30.475 --> 08:31.708
- Ben!
- No, he's doing great.

08:31.777 --> 08:33.092
You're in big trouble, mister.

08:33.118 --> 08:34.755
Jay, I'm so sorry. We
were just trying to s...

08:34.780 --> 08:35.879
Enough!

08:35.947 --> 08:37.246
Come on, Joe!

08:37.315 --> 08:39.357
Enough! (laughs)

08:40.349 --> 08:41.462
(door slams)

08:41.486 --> 08:42.918
Could you have rolled over any faster?

08:42.986 --> 08:44.053
My dad didn't know anything.

08:44.121 --> 08:45.620
That was just a big act for his kid.

08:45.690 --> 08:47.756
Yeah, I know. I was playing along to...

08:47.825 --> 08:49.091
Save it, okay?

08:49.116 --> 08:53.384
Somewhere, one of these green
pins is very disappointed.

08:53.664 --> 08:55.597
(patriotic music plays)

08:59.436 --> 09:02.870
Nachos. Come get some nachos.

09:02.939 --> 09:05.039
No one even knew that I was back there.

09:05.108 --> 09:07.864
You know it's loud when you
can't hear <i> my</i> voice!

09:08.161 --> 09:09.476
My goodness.

09:09.552 --> 09:11.920
At this rate, I'll break
my own sales record.

09:11.981 --> 09:13.114
- Oh.
- Hola.

09:13.183 --> 09:15.183
Do you guys want to try some nachos?

09:15.251 --> 09:16.317
That sounds pretty good.

09:16.385 --> 09:18.185
Ugh, you are so transparent, Glenn.

09:18.253 --> 09:19.794
Come, come, come.

09:21.223 --> 09:23.122
We're expanding to chips.

09:24.326 --> 09:25.592
(chuckles)

09:25.660 --> 09:27.961
- Mmm. Mmm!
- Cam, you're staring.

09:28.014 --> 09:29.942
No, I'm not. So are you.

09:29.983 --> 09:31.198
- (ringtone plays)
- Ooh, I should take this.

09:31.266 --> 09:32.680
It might be drizzle-related.

09:33.768 --> 09:35.177
So, Haley,

09:35.202 --> 09:37.426
we are here to help you.
Tell us what "c..." is.

09:37.471 --> 09:38.704
You told him?

09:38.773 --> 09:40.924
You can confide in us.
We're middle-aged gay men.

09:40.949 --> 09:43.109
Whatever it is, we have heard of it.

09:43.177 --> 09:44.243
Fine.

09:44.311 --> 09:45.611
The other night, Rainer asked me

09:45.679 --> 09:48.680
if I would be into candling.

09:49.574 --> 09:52.516
- Oh.
- Oh.

09:52.585 --> 09:54.018
You know what that is, right?

09:54.103 --> 09:55.253
- Yes!
- Yes!

09:55.278 --> 09:57.574
It's when you do the...

09:57.599 --> 09:58.999
and then... and then you...

09:59.024 --> 10:01.825
and then you do the... the boop, boop.

10:02.028 --> 10:05.591
Candling is where you
light a hollow candle

10:05.616 --> 10:07.489
and insert it...

10:07.533 --> 10:09.620
into one of the ear canals...

10:09.645 --> 10:11.701
to remove ear wax.

10:11.771 --> 10:13.470
Ah... oh, God.

10:13.538 --> 10:14.738
The thing is, I don't
know if I want to be

10:14.807 --> 10:16.240
that intimate with Rainer.

10:16.308 --> 10:18.575
Am I really ready to see
gunk coming out of his ear?

10:18.600 --> 10:20.677
I mean, like, what if
he stops being sexy?

10:20.746 --> 10:22.012
Well, it is intimacy like that

10:22.081 --> 10:24.281
that separates casual dating
from something more serious.

10:24.349 --> 10:25.681
But what about what you said earlier,

10:25.750 --> 10:28.151
how even committed relationships
like yours have boundaries?

10:28.219 --> 10:29.451
Excuse me, what boundaries?

10:29.520 --> 10:31.587
Hey, my phone died. Can
I borrow one of yours?

10:31.656 --> 10:33.589
You told her we have boundaries?

10:33.658 --> 10:35.324
You told them I asked you to candle me?

10:35.393 --> 10:37.804
Okay, I feel like this
tea's getting away from us.

10:38.958 --> 10:42.193
Nachos! Get your nachos here!

10:43.753 --> 10:44.952
Get!

10:45.349 --> 10:46.348
Get!

10:50.096 --> 10:52.373
Goaltending! Ref, do your job!

10:52.442 --> 10:54.440
- I'm a pharmacist.
- Oh, sorry.

10:54.465 --> 10:55.578
(buzzer blares)

10:55.603 --> 10:56.803
(whistle blows)

10:57.551 --> 10:58.646
- Phil.
- Oh!

10:58.715 --> 11:00.848
- You seem a little tight, man.
- Hey, DeAndre Jordan.

11:00.917 --> 11:03.017
Uh, no, no, no, just
working out the Jim-jams.

11:03.085 --> 11:05.340
- First half's about getting a read.
- Yeah, right.

11:05.365 --> 11:07.188
I didn't realize that
fans were coaching.

11:07.256 --> 11:09.023
And you're helping the parents.

11:09.091 --> 11:11.025
Teachers are the
backbone of our country.

11:11.093 --> 11:13.134
Get out of here. Parenting is
the hardest job in the world.

11:13.159 --> 11:15.134
I'm so sick of you acting
like you know everything.

11:15.159 --> 11:17.263
Going to therapy did nothing for you.

11:17.332 --> 11:19.032
First of all, stop transferring.

11:19.100 --> 11:21.067
Secondly, how about I coach that team,

11:21.136 --> 11:22.468
you coach this team?

11:22.537 --> 11:25.534
10 Dolphin Dollars you
and Phil are going down.

11:25.559 --> 11:27.207
- Oh, um...
- 10?

11:27.275 --> 11:29.309
You can't even get a
Foam Flipper with that.

11:29.377 --> 11:31.677
- Let's make it 50.
- D.J., please.

11:31.746 --> 11:33.078
How bout 50 real ones?

11:33.147 --> 11:34.546
Okay. Make it five grand.

11:34.614 --> 11:36.349
- That's the jump?
- (whistle blows)

11:36.374 --> 11:38.133
- Go win this for me.
- Okay.

11:38.158 --> 11:39.867
- (Grunts)
- We're on the same team!

11:39.892 --> 11:41.519
Foul! Somebody fouled me!

11:41.588 --> 11:42.721
Stop flopping!

11:42.789 --> 11:43.989
Phil, come on, man. Focus!

11:44.058 --> 11:45.324
We just bet our Olympic gold medals.

11:45.392 --> 11:48.426
Why? No one's making you do this!

11:52.947 --> 11:54.634
I hate that I made you uncomfortable.

11:54.657 --> 11:56.728
I-I just wanted us to
be real with each other.

11:56.753 --> 11:58.149
I want that, too.

11:58.782 --> 12:00.895
I think I'm ready. I will candle you.

12:00.963 --> 12:01.996
Oh, look at that...

12:02.064 --> 12:03.898
two virtual strangers
breaking down walls

12:03.966 --> 12:05.312
when I didn't even know we had any.

12:05.337 --> 12:06.727
When I told Haley we had boundaries,

12:06.743 --> 12:08.409
I just meant that
there are certain things

12:08.478 --> 12:10.680
- I'd rather not ask you to do.
- Like what?

12:10.705 --> 12:11.880
We should be open and honest

12:11.949 --> 12:14.150
about whatever our wants and needs are.

12:14.218 --> 12:16.083
As long as we're being real,

12:16.153 --> 12:17.685
there's something you need to know.

12:17.754 --> 12:19.222
There is absolutely nothing I...

12:19.247 --> 12:21.597
- Shh! I want to hear this.
- HALEY: Give me your hands.

12:21.622 --> 12:23.691
Okay, deep breath. Come on, Haley.

12:23.760 --> 12:25.160
(exhales sharply)

12:25.519 --> 12:27.509
I draw in my eyebrows.

12:27.534 --> 12:28.700
Oh.

12:28.725 --> 12:30.269
This is the real me.

12:32.368 --> 12:34.067
Did he leave? Is he still here?

12:34.136 --> 12:37.366
I'm still here, and
you're still beautiful.

12:37.391 --> 12:39.139
Stop running from me.

12:39.208 --> 12:40.915
Fine.

12:41.477 --> 12:42.926
I have a confession of my own.

12:42.951 --> 12:44.084
Two seconds.

12:44.109 --> 12:46.009
I've never told anyone this.

12:46.524 --> 12:47.581
(sighs)

12:47.650 --> 12:49.315
I use tape to pull my neck back.

12:49.384 --> 12:50.962
I knew it!

12:51.119 --> 12:52.918
Wow. So brave.

12:52.987 --> 12:55.354
- I feel so naked right now.
- Me, too.

12:55.423 --> 12:57.256
They look exactly the same, right?

12:57.325 --> 12:58.391
No, what they look is happy

12:58.416 --> 12:59.469
because they are brave enough

12:59.494 --> 13:00.893
to be vulnerable with each other.

13:00.918 --> 13:02.652
- Cam...
- It's just ironic

13:02.677 --> 13:05.537
that you won't ask me
to do whatever it is

13:05.562 --> 13:07.263
because you're worried I'll judge you,

13:07.288 --> 13:09.401
but I'm judging you
now for not trusting me,

13:09.469 --> 13:11.224
and that hurts.

13:14.131 --> 13:15.407
You're right, of course.

13:15.475 --> 13:17.409
This is only bringing
us closer together.

13:17.477 --> 13:19.477
Uh-huh! Who'd you say
normally does this?

13:19.546 --> 13:21.724
Uh, this place near my old office.

13:21.749 --> 13:24.147
- Lily in a pinch.
- Okay, well, I think that's it.

13:24.217 --> 13:25.416
Oh, no, you have to go
over it one more time.

13:25.484 --> 13:27.741
Okay, we're not painting a bridge.

13:28.858 --> 13:31.567
Okay, I've checked twice. There's
no invoice for this last closet.

13:31.592 --> 13:32.778
Well, there has to be,

13:32.803 --> 13:34.417
and we've got to find
it before my dad does.

13:34.442 --> 13:36.393
Is there any chance you
accidentally shredded it?

13:36.462 --> 13:38.562
Don't worry. If I did,
it's an easy restore.

13:38.631 --> 13:42.268
I was regional jigsaw champion
in the under-60 category.

13:42.293 --> 13:43.866
(sneezes)

13:44.278 --> 13:45.901
That weird sneeze.

13:45.970 --> 13:48.070
You sound like the guy
who was sick on the news.

13:48.139 --> 13:50.906
No, that guy was falling apart.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.764
- Aah!
- You can't be infected.

13:52.789 --> 13:55.044
It's not like you've spent
any time around that wood.

13:55.113 --> 13:56.479
I mean, you don't hang
out in the warehouse.

13:56.532 --> 13:58.242
I've seen how much those guys pants you.

13:58.283 --> 13:59.413
Oh, my God.

13:59.438 --> 14:00.616
My mom has a new boyfriend,

14:00.684 --> 14:02.251
and she doesn't want
him to know she has kids,

14:02.319 --> 14:04.953
so when he comes over, I
sleep in the conference room.

14:04.978 --> 14:06.798
Which is where the sample closet is,

14:06.823 --> 14:08.306
which is why there's no record of it!

14:08.331 --> 14:09.666
Oh, God!

14:11.890 --> 14:13.528
JAY: <i> I don't like to
talk about it a lot,</i>

14:13.597 --> 14:15.587
<i>but I have a certain
expertise in timber.</i>

14:15.612 --> 14:16.797
<i>Even blindfolded,</i>

14:16.866 --> 14:19.800
<i>I can tell a Galapagos
teak from a Maltese cherry.</i>

14:19.869 --> 14:21.935
<i>Came in handy for a cop friend of mine.</i>

14:22.004 --> 14:24.424
<i>Helped him round up the Cedar Boys.</i>

14:24.760 --> 14:26.374
Dad? Hey!

14:26.442 --> 14:28.041
What are you doing in here, huh?

14:28.110 --> 14:29.777
I'm checking out this new wood.

14:29.845 --> 14:31.754
It's not new wood.

14:31.779 --> 14:33.480
(sneezes)

14:33.548 --> 14:34.947
The hell's the matter with him?

14:35.016 --> 14:37.150
- He's got allergies. Yeah.
- Allergies. Allergies.

14:37.218 --> 14:38.785
Oh, Dad, have you... have you seen

14:38.853 --> 14:40.528
this new fish tank we just got?

14:40.553 --> 14:41.622
Check it.

14:41.647 --> 14:42.756
Where did you say we got this wood?

14:42.816 --> 14:44.647
Please, stop obsessing about the wood.

14:44.680 --> 14:46.446
- Hungry little sucker, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

14:46.471 --> 14:47.860
You sure that's okay for him to eat?

14:47.929 --> 14:49.027
Yeah, it's fine.

14:49.096 --> 14:51.297
Those fish are celebrated
for their hardiness.

14:51.365 --> 14:52.464
Yeah, hardy.

14:52.533 --> 14:54.099
Yeah, they're very
popular amongst rappers

14:54.168 --> 14:57.869
'cause they do equally well
in Jacuzzis and champagne.

14:57.938 --> 14:59.271
Where's Joe?

14:59.340 --> 15:00.639
- He's with Margaret.
- Oh, okay.

15:00.708 --> 15:02.341
I'm gonna bring him in here,
have him check out this fish.

15:02.410 --> 15:04.376
- That's a good idea.
- Getting back to this wood.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.944
Dad, the wood is fine. It's...

15:07.223 --> 15:08.680
Oh, my...

15:08.748 --> 15:11.048
Turns out, the wood doesn't
just make people sick.

15:11.117 --> 15:12.517
It also kills fish.

15:12.585 --> 15:15.420
Well, I couldn't let Dad
know I bought murder wood,

15:15.488 --> 15:17.588
so I sent Ben to get a replacement fish

15:17.657 --> 15:18.823
from the tank in the lobby.

15:18.848 --> 15:21.154
So, those seem right to you? Hmm?

15:21.179 --> 15:23.794
They're study enough. Smooth pivot.

15:24.577 --> 15:26.129
Even glide.

15:26.198 --> 15:28.932
I was already suspicious of that
wood, but then it kills a fish?

15:29.000 --> 15:31.369
Claire obviously bought
some of that tainted lumber,

15:31.394 --> 15:32.803
and then she tries hide it?

15:32.871 --> 15:35.706
She must think I'm denser
than a Ponderosa maple.

15:35.774 --> 15:38.339
- That's a nice, easy ride.
- Yeah.

15:39.162 --> 15:41.227
Hey, kiddo, why's your hand wet?

15:41.252 --> 15:42.619
It's not. It's sweaty.

15:42.644 --> 15:44.089
I went to the gym this morning.

15:44.114 --> 15:46.148
Fridays, I do legs and hands.

15:46.217 --> 15:47.683
Claire, here's the water you asked for.

15:47.752 --> 15:49.017
Thank you!

15:49.086 --> 15:50.486
(sneezes)

15:50.555 --> 15:51.821
My tooth just fell out.

15:51.889 --> 15:53.422
You know, I got a little
something stuck in my throat.

15:53.491 --> 15:54.557
Give me a slug of that water.

15:54.625 --> 15:56.325
Oh, no, you don't want this lobby water.

15:56.393 --> 15:58.493
- I just need a sip.
- It's from the fountain,

15:58.562 --> 16:00.061
and the warehouse guys put
their mouth all over it.

16:00.129 --> 16:02.263
- Just give it to me.
- I can't.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.175
Oh, my God, you actually did it.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.511
Can you feel that thing
swimming around in your belly?

16:10.536 --> 16:12.006
You knew there was a fish in there?

16:12.075 --> 16:13.707
- I saw you toss the other one out.
- (burps)

16:13.776 --> 16:15.376
You're so afraid of
getting caught screwing up,

16:15.444 --> 16:17.191
- you'd swallow an animal?
- (groans)

16:17.216 --> 16:19.225
This sort of seems like a family thing,

16:19.250 --> 16:21.724
and my vision is tunneling, so...

16:22.528 --> 16:24.985
All right, well, we
recalled all the bad wood,

16:25.053 --> 16:27.220
but that doesn't mean
that we didn't screw up.

16:27.289 --> 16:28.941
So, go ahead, let me have it.

16:28.966 --> 16:30.223
Tear my head off.

16:30.292 --> 16:32.224
Tell me how I've
disappointed you yet again.

16:32.293 --> 16:34.159
And what is happening?

16:34.228 --> 16:37.196
All day long I've been
trying to get Joe to fear me.

16:37.265 --> 16:39.824
Maybe that's not the
best thing for kids.

16:39.918 --> 16:41.166
_

16:41.191 --> 16:43.569
- Hi.
- Well, I made six Dolphin Dollars

16:43.638 --> 16:45.438
plus 20 real ones from some weirdo

16:45.507 --> 16:47.406
who wanted me to ladle cheese
straight into his mouth.

16:47.474 --> 16:49.207
Ew. All right, papi, thank you so much,

16:49.276 --> 16:52.277
but I still need help
attracting customers over there.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.045
Oh, I can see if Phil
has that thing in his car

16:54.114 --> 16:55.547
that flails around like this.

16:55.616 --> 16:56.648
Claire?

16:56.717 --> 16:58.798
- No, his Tube Dude.
- Oh.

16:59.687 --> 17:00.819
Oh!

17:00.978 --> 17:02.531
Can I help you with anything?

17:02.556 --> 17:03.655
I'm just going to buy a snack

17:03.724 --> 17:05.088
with my last five Dolphin Dollars.

17:05.156 --> 17:06.356
I don't want to throw them away.

17:06.425 --> 17:07.458
That's how they get you.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.593
(chuckles) The nachos are amazing.

17:09.662 --> 17:11.662
But do not get anything from
the stand that is over there...

17:11.731 --> 17:12.797
The hot dog lady?

17:12.865 --> 17:14.698
She just said the same thing about you.

17:14.723 --> 17:17.512
You two remind me of
me and DeAndre Jordan.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.502
We have a rivalry, and I don't know why.

17:19.571 --> 17:22.238
Maybe in life, we resent
people who hold up a mirror

17:22.307 --> 17:24.770
and force us to look at
the worst in ourselves.

17:24.795 --> 17:27.521
I see what you're
saying, Charles Barkley.

17:27.546 --> 17:29.264
And that's what we call an assist.

17:30.381 --> 17:31.943
Hand stamp.

17:33.384 --> 17:36.038
Donna, we have to stop this fighting.

17:36.063 --> 17:39.521
A wise man once told me
that we resent mirrors

17:39.590 --> 17:41.990
that show us what we don't want to see.

17:42.059 --> 17:43.694
(scoffs) That's ridiculous.

17:43.719 --> 17:44.960
I love mirrors.

17:44.985 --> 17:46.462
But the point is that I was mad

17:46.530 --> 17:49.631
because you made me see who I really am,

17:49.700 --> 17:52.601
and I was shocked to
see what I have become.

17:52.670 --> 17:53.735
Stop talking.

17:53.804 --> 17:55.536
You're sounding human,
and I don't like that.

17:55.605 --> 17:59.540
I am soft, privileged lady,
and I thought that bothered me.

17:59.609 --> 18:02.677
Until today, I realized that it doesn't.

18:02.745 --> 18:04.378
I don't want to do this.

18:04.447 --> 18:06.914
I love my pretty, pretty life.

18:06.983 --> 18:08.649
The only thing that makes me feel bad

18:08.718 --> 18:12.299
is that I don't really
feel bad about it.

18:14.422 --> 18:17.079
Thank you so much for opening up to me.

18:17.104 --> 18:19.284
I almost started to
feel something for you,

18:19.309 --> 18:21.194
but then when you said
you don't feel guilty,

18:21.262 --> 18:24.097
my rage returned tenfold.

18:24.165 --> 18:27.066
And I need that rage. It
gets me up in the morning.

18:27.135 --> 18:30.970
Well, if it helps you,
I eat everything I want,

18:31.038 --> 18:33.357
and I work out like once a year.

18:33.382 --> 18:35.382
You're horrible.

18:36.104 --> 18:38.276
(sighs) Oh, thank you.

18:38.345 --> 18:40.479
All right, guys... tie
game, three seconds left.

18:40.548 --> 18:42.615
There's only one thing that
they're not gonna be expecting.

18:42.683 --> 18:44.783
- We're gonna get the ball to Phil.
- What?

18:44.852 --> 18:46.485
They're not even guarding you.

18:46.553 --> 18:48.820
I'm so sure of this play,
I just bet Barkley my car.

18:48.889 --> 18:50.321
Is it a-a Honda?

18:50.390 --> 18:52.590
No, it's a Phantom with my
head as the hood ornament.

18:52.659 --> 18:54.325
All right, let's win this thing.

18:54.394 --> 18:56.995
Phil, honey, hi! I'm sorry we're late,

18:57.063 --> 18:58.496
but at least we're here
for the end of the game.

18:58.565 --> 19:00.431
I could really use a win
on the day I drank a fish.

19:00.500 --> 19:01.766
Drank <i> like</i> a fish.

19:01.835 --> 19:03.700
Wow, a bunch of NBA players
are tweeting about this bet

19:03.769 --> 19:05.468
between Charles Barkley
and DeAndre Jordan.

19:05.538 --> 19:08.005
And they're live-streaming it, so
like 60,000 people are watching.

19:08.073 --> 19:09.973
Since when do people
care about basketball?

19:10.042 --> 19:12.275
Calm down, Phil. You can do this, pal.

19:12.344 --> 19:14.377
You choose now to believe
in me for the first time?

19:14.446 --> 19:15.478
(whistle blows)

19:15.503 --> 19:16.880
All right, Phil. You got this, man.

19:18.544 --> 19:19.575
(whistle blows)

19:19.600 --> 19:20.647
Two shots!

19:21.622 --> 19:23.085
I can't go, Coach.

19:23.154 --> 19:24.575
Ow! My ankle.

19:25.661 --> 19:28.323
Well, well, well...

19:28.392 --> 19:30.605
League rules dictate,
if a player can't attempt

19:30.630 --> 19:32.494
a free throw because of injury,

19:32.564 --> 19:34.597
opposing team gets to pick the shooter.

19:34.666 --> 19:36.824
Right, but you're not a know-it-all.

19:36.849 --> 19:38.700
Don't give this anger power.

19:38.948 --> 19:41.607
I pick you. Don't choke.

19:43.806 --> 19:45.350
Come on, honey. Come on, Phil.

19:45.375 --> 19:46.541
(crowd cheering)

19:53.283 --> 19:54.949
ANNOUNCER: <i>Phil Dunphy
to the free-throw line.</i>

19:55.017 --> 19:56.383
<i>Tie score.</i>

19:56.452 --> 19:59.125
<i>This is for all the marbles, folks.</i>

20:00.023 --> 20:01.672
(sighs)

20:02.122 --> 20:03.889
(crowd groans)

20:04.193 --> 20:05.392
MAN: Come on!

20:05.461 --> 20:08.195
(electricity crackles)

20:08.263 --> 20:09.597
What happened?

20:09.665 --> 20:11.531
It's gonna take an hour
to get the power back up,

20:11.600 --> 20:13.232
so they called the game.

20:13.301 --> 20:15.647
I just feel so bad for Phil.

20:15.672 --> 20:17.904
You know him as this happy-go-lucky guy,

20:17.973 --> 20:20.907
but he has been beating
himself up over this for a year.

20:20.976 --> 20:23.843
Oh, and he was so close!

20:23.912 --> 20:26.112
It's gonna haunt him never knowing

20:26.180 --> 20:28.547
if he would have made that shot.

20:30.350 --> 20:31.460
(sighs)

20:31.485 --> 20:32.733
Game's on the line.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.303
Everybody's watching.

20:37.806 --> 20:39.105
(sighs)

20:39.192 --> 20:41.860
This one's for all the marbles, folks.

20:58.042 --> 21:00.055
Son of a bitch made it.

21:03.058 --> 21:04.895
You know, I'm glad
we're doing this again.

21:04.911 --> 21:06.978
Yeah, I think we just put too
much pressure on it the first time.

21:07.046 --> 21:08.212
You know, humans aren't the only ones

21:08.281 --> 21:09.413
who respond badly to pressure.

21:09.482 --> 21:11.582
Did I ever tell you about
the day without eggs?

21:11.651 --> 21:14.250
It was at the start of
the Omelet Days Festival.

21:14.319 --> 21:16.452
Up with the sun, I grab my basket,

21:16.521 --> 21:18.002
into the hen-house I go...

21:18.027 --> 21:21.381
34 hens, nary an egg.

21:21.426 --> 21:22.774
I know, I know.

21:22.799 --> 21:26.262
My grandpa said it was the
worst case of avian anxiety

21:26.331 --> 21:28.097
he'd seen since Pearl Harbor.

21:28.166 --> 21:30.966
That's when they had to take
the radio out of the coop.
