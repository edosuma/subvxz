WEBVTT

00:29.988 --> 00:31.406
[strumming]

00:35.660 --> 00:36.953
[feedback squealing]

00:39.289 --> 00:40.707
[plucks strings]

00:42.667 --> 00:44.794
[Sean Brock] I'm 39 years old,

00:44.878 --> 00:48.048
and it's crazy to think
that for this long,

00:48.757 --> 00:50.967
all I've done is work in a kitchen.

00:51.676 --> 00:55.346
All I've done
is focus on being a great chef.

01:13.156 --> 01:14.240
That's a long road.

01:14.908 --> 01:18.536
And that's...
a lot of damage along the way.

01:25.627 --> 01:29.464
And to be the chef that I am today
wouldn't have happened

01:29.547 --> 01:35.261
if I hadn't immersed myself
in that level of workaholism.

01:39.432 --> 01:40.350
But...

01:41.101 --> 01:42.352
it nearly killed me.

01:42.769 --> 01:46.940
It literally... almost killed me.

01:47.774 --> 01:49.025
[chuckles softly]

02:01.996 --> 02:03.998
[opening theme playing]

03:17.864 --> 03:20.992
[John T. Edge] The South has long been
a beleaguered place, an insecure place.

03:21.326 --> 03:22.994
It's a place wracked by guilt.

03:23.828 --> 03:28.708
And those insecurities are informed
by our peculiar and tragic-ass history.

03:29.834 --> 03:32.003
And so, for the longest time,

03:32.086 --> 03:36.341
Southerners didn't recognize
the import of our food culture.

03:37.759 --> 03:40.595
We swept the knowledge under the rug.
We swept the people under the rug.

03:41.596 --> 03:43.097
What Sean Brock did was say,

03:43.181 --> 03:46.851
"The products and people
of this place are of deep value,"

03:46.935 --> 03:50.480
and that, "this is the most important
American cuisine one might interpret."

03:50.813 --> 03:51.898
That was bold.

04:01.407 --> 04:04.285
[Adi Noe] Sean is one of the most
obsessive people I've ever met.

04:04.369 --> 04:08.790
He's obsessive about cars,
music, folk art. He's all in.

04:09.040 --> 04:13.628
Sean is 100%. 150%.

04:13.711 --> 04:15.630
If he's into it, it's an obsession.

04:18.258 --> 04:21.010
[Tyler Brown]
So much of Sean's food is story.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.638
Whether it's his grandmother
and her cornbread,

04:23.721 --> 04:26.933
or seeking the origin of okra in Africa...

04:27.642 --> 04:30.103
it all has roads
that lead back to cooking.

04:34.232 --> 04:36.734
[BJ Dennis]
He's retracing the roots of Southern food:

04:37.318 --> 04:38.569
the Native American influence,

04:39.153 --> 04:41.781
the French influence
and the West African influence,

04:41.864 --> 04:45.201
because he wants to tell the true story
of Southern food.

04:47.745 --> 04:51.624
[Edge] Sean has two flagship restaurants
in Charleston:

04:52.292 --> 04:55.753
one, McCrady's,
which is this kind of elegant salon,

04:56.296 --> 04:58.214
this place of luxury,

04:58.298 --> 05:01.843
where you trust the chef to go
on this magic carpet ride.

05:04.345 --> 05:05.513
His second restaurant,

05:05.763 --> 05:11.561
Husk, is resolutely, unimpeachably,
unapologetically Southern.

05:12.437 --> 05:17.567
It's fried pig ears. It's shucky beans.
And it is not fussy.

05:18.318 --> 05:22.322
It is a place that harkens back
to his grandma's table.

05:25.450 --> 05:31.497
Sean can devote himself to doing
ballotines of quail in one moment,

05:31.581 --> 05:36.544
and devote himself to making the best damn
chicken and dumplings in another moment.

05:37.045 --> 05:39.547
And that's one definition of genius,

05:39.630 --> 05:44.177
to hold two seemingly opposing ideas
in your head at the same time.

05:46.179 --> 05:48.014
That's what his cooking shows.

05:48.639 --> 05:52.602
But to understand Sean, you have to
go back to his grandmother's kitchen.

05:52.685 --> 05:55.646
You've gotta go back
to the coalfields of Virginia.

06:11.245 --> 06:12.872
[bubbling]

06:34.477 --> 06:38.940
[Brock] Most people have this idea
of what Southern food is:

06:40.358 --> 06:43.361
being unhealthy, and greasy
and calorie-heavy.

06:46.280 --> 06:48.741
But it's so much more than that.

06:51.035 --> 06:52.120
It's amazing ingredients.

06:53.496 --> 06:54.997
Unique ingredients.

06:56.457 --> 06:59.335
It's specific varietals
of plants and beans,

06:59.919 --> 07:03.256
the preserves and the old traditions.

07:06.384 --> 07:11.806
Taking humble ingredients and turning them
into something truly extraordinary.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.648
That's what I see Southern food as.

07:29.532 --> 07:34.829
But, in the South,
we've lost the seeds, the plants,

07:34.912 --> 07:36.038
the stories.

07:39.459 --> 07:43.796
And when we lose these plants,
when we lose these breeds,

07:44.088 --> 07:47.258
we lose multiple generations of wisdom.

07:47.800 --> 07:52.180
We lose that connection to a culture,
to a region and to a place.

07:54.474 --> 07:58.269
Once you realize that, you understand
what a tragedy that is.

07:59.854 --> 08:03.816
And if you have an opportunity
to possibly help change that...

08:06.402 --> 08:09.906
that becomes your path.
That becomes your journey,

08:10.656 --> 08:16.287
and, ultimately, you can make a small
contribution to something that you love.

08:22.043 --> 08:24.003
The mother of vinegar
looks like a jellyfish.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.423
[chef laughs] Kind of looks like liver.

08:28.007 --> 08:31.511
[Brock laughing]
Enter Sean's liver joke here.

08:37.433 --> 08:39.852
I still have a jar of vinegar I made
at McCrady's, at my house.

08:39.936 --> 08:42.605
Yup. So that started
with my grandma's mother,

08:42.688 --> 08:45.525
which was probably 40 years old
when I got it.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.276
It was always under the sink.

08:48.110 --> 08:51.697
That was floating in there
and it used to scare me to death.

08:52.406 --> 08:55.826
That was the first thing
I grabbed after her funeral.

08:56.661 --> 09:01.165
So, all those base vinegars that are
at McCrady's are all my grandma's.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.292
So, we'll be able to keep that going
and going.

09:25.439 --> 09:28.734
I was born and raised
in the Appalachian Mountains of Virginia,

09:29.944 --> 09:31.362
deep in the coalfields.

09:34.448 --> 09:40.162
I just remember, as a kid,
playing in piles of coal all the time.

09:44.041 --> 09:46.586
My father grew up very, very, very poor.

09:47.628 --> 09:50.673
When he was 11, he had to start
working in the coalfields,

09:51.090 --> 09:54.969
and that just shaped him into someone

09:55.052 --> 10:01.309
who never wanted his kids to grow up poor,
so he made sure of that.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.523
He never stopped working.

10:08.649 --> 10:12.153
But he loved life.
He really, really loved life.

10:13.404 --> 10:17.116
He ate steaks probably four nights a week.

10:17.617 --> 10:24.332
He was always playing pranks
and driving muscle cars really fast.

10:25.041 --> 10:28.669
And we had an unbelievable childhood.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.723
[car engine starts]

10:46.187 --> 10:52.693
But when I was 11 years old, uh,
my father passed away of a heart attack.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.363
He was 39 years old.

11:04.372 --> 11:08.125
At that point,
we didn't really have a choice.

11:08.876 --> 11:12.254
We moved in with my grandmother.

11:24.725 --> 11:28.979
My grandmother
was constantly handling food.

11:29.605 --> 11:34.110
Huge, huge garden that was for survival.

11:35.277 --> 11:38.239
If we ate something,
we grew it or preserved it.

11:40.157 --> 11:44.912
I grew up in that garden in the sun,
in the dirt,

11:45.996 --> 11:51.043
picking things and eating them while
they're still alive and still vibrant.

11:52.253 --> 11:56.632
Food was this incredible source of pride.

11:57.842 --> 12:00.469
My grandmother was constantly teaching me

12:00.553 --> 12:04.265
the things that her grandparents
taught her about food:

12:05.683 --> 12:08.894
how to know when potatoes
are ready to pull out of the ground,

12:09.520 --> 12:12.523
how to pick beans when they're ready,

12:13.566 --> 12:17.486
how to snap a bean
and string it at lightning speed.

12:18.654 --> 12:20.573
That was just how I grew up.

12:24.160 --> 12:29.623
My vault of deliciousness
will always be there,

12:29.707 --> 12:34.211
and it was formed
during that period of my life.

12:40.384 --> 12:41.802
[Brock sighs deeply]

12:41.886 --> 12:43.971
I remember bein' a kid and, uh...

12:44.054 --> 12:46.974
All of the neighbors around,
everybody had a different greasy bean.

12:47.767 --> 12:51.604
And there would be
this competition every year, who...

12:51.687 --> 12:54.273
how many bushels you grew.

12:54.356 --> 12:55.649
[man] It was a matter of pride.

12:55.733 --> 12:59.195
And you think every single holler,
every single family had unique beans,

12:59.904 --> 13:01.989
corn, tomatoes, squash, everything.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.869
That's a pretty color
that you get on that pod there.

13:10.331 --> 13:13.667
So many of these things, as you've
noticed over the years, I'm sure,

13:14.376 --> 13:17.129
take on different names.
The most common is the family name.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.715
This one came
from Washington Parish, Louisiana,

13:20.132 --> 13:23.677
grown for years by the Jones family,
so they refer to it as the Jones pea.

13:23.761 --> 13:25.846
It's actually gray crowder.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.933
I've told guests many times,
who've come down to the shed...

13:29.016 --> 13:32.436
We're talkin' about peas, beans,
butter beans, you name it.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.814
After a while,
you'd, uh, look at that and you'd say,

13:34.897 --> 13:36.941
"Yeah, I see that.
What else you got to offer?"

13:37.024 --> 13:40.778
It's not till you put that living history
with it, the story with it.

13:42.404 --> 13:45.199
You've got a chain this long,
with no links missing, all...

13:46.325 --> 13:49.870
passed down to today and all that history
that went in between.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.414
[Brock] Remind me what this is.

13:52.873 --> 13:54.333
[man] It's, uh, Jimson weed.

13:55.251 --> 13:58.462
One of my friends, uh, ate it
and then ate a whole bag of dog food.

13:58.879 --> 14:00.047
-Ate a whole...
-[both laughing]

14:01.674 --> 14:03.133
[man] Ate a whole bag of dog--

14:03.717 --> 14:06.053
-I gotta remember that.
-[Brock continues laughing]

14:07.221 --> 14:10.683
-Oh, man... [laughs]
-Ate a whole bag of dog food?

14:10.766 --> 14:13.310
Living in the country,
you gotta find some way to have fun.

14:13.394 --> 14:14.645
[both laugh]

14:15.229 --> 14:17.106
[Brock] At the age of 15, we moved

14:17.690 --> 14:21.026
to a larger town in Virginia,
called Abingdon,

14:21.110 --> 14:23.946
and that's when
I got my first restaurant job.

14:26.949 --> 14:31.161
First day I walked into that kitchen,
it was not what I was expecting.

14:31.245 --> 14:33.664
-[indistinct chatter]
-[objects clattering]

14:35.124 --> 14:39.336
It was the scariest,
craziest thing I'd ever seen.

14:39.837 --> 14:40.713
[sizzling]

14:42.047 --> 14:46.093
Heavy metal playing so loud...

14:46.176 --> 14:48.220
-[music playing loudly]
-[indistinct chatter]

14:50.014 --> 14:52.141
Tickets waving in the wind...

14:55.644 --> 14:59.398
There was a smoking table in the kitchen.

15:02.276 --> 15:07.740
And all of these people moving so quickly,
and screaming and yelling,

15:07.823 --> 15:11.660
and talking about how much whisky
they drank the night before.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.163
It was like a pirate ship.

15:16.498 --> 15:20.961
And I remember, the first few nights,
being splashed with hot oil,

15:21.045 --> 15:23.213
and just burns everywhere.

15:23.297 --> 15:26.258
And people seeing my arms
and thinking I'd been abused.

15:26.800 --> 15:30.554
And I would say with pride,
"[stutters] Oh, I'm a chef. I'm a cook."

15:31.805 --> 15:33.349
I was hooked immediately.

15:40.981 --> 15:42.608
[seagulls squawking]

15:47.237 --> 15:49.198
[fog horn blowing]

15:50.491 --> 15:52.368
[church bell tolling]

15:52.451 --> 15:56.455
[Brock] After high school,
I knew that I wanted to be a chef,

15:57.039 --> 16:01.001
and so I started looking into
the best culinary cities in America.

16:01.293 --> 16:06.340
Charleston was the closest, so I packed up
and moved to Charleston.

16:08.258 --> 16:11.053
[Edge] If you think about
restaurant cities in the American South,

16:11.512 --> 16:15.265
the most storied cuisine
emanates from Charleston.

16:16.183 --> 16:19.853
And Sean arrives like a tourist, almost.

16:20.604 --> 16:25.484
This kind of wild-eyed kid,
who was so excited, just curious.

16:27.736 --> 16:29.029
[slurps]

16:29.113 --> 16:31.907
It was such a culture shock for me.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.284
[sniffs]

16:36.203 --> 16:40.749
It might as well have been Japanese food
to an Appalachian guy.

16:45.546 --> 16:49.049
I had never ever stepped foot

16:49.591 --> 16:52.886
in any restaurant
as nice as the ones are here.

16:54.013 --> 16:57.307
To see a kitchen
full of professional chefs,

16:57.391 --> 17:00.144
turning out
these gorgeous plates of food...

17:01.437 --> 17:03.897
it was exhilarating.

17:07.192 --> 17:10.529
At that time,
the chefs doing fine dining in Charleston

17:10.612 --> 17:14.074
were taking these iconic
and classic dishes,

17:14.158 --> 17:16.827
like Hoppin' John, and shrimp and grits,

17:17.911 --> 17:20.080
and cleaning them up,
making them beautiful.

17:22.708 --> 17:24.001
I wanted to learn how to do that.

17:24.585 --> 17:28.338
So, I threw myself
into the craft of cooking.

17:44.688 --> 17:46.482
[crackling]

17:53.405 --> 17:54.990
[chef 1] Want to eat a palmetto tree?

17:58.202 --> 17:59.244
[chef 2] It smells pretty good.

18:02.664 --> 18:04.333
-Cook something directly on here?
-[sniffs]

18:04.416 --> 18:06.001
[Brock] Ah! We cook rice in this!

18:06.251 --> 18:07.461
Yeah, and it'll seal.

18:07.544 --> 18:11.673
So, we could put rice in this,
seal it off and throw it in the fire.

18:13.550 --> 18:15.177
It definitely gets super fibrous
at the end--

18:15.260 --> 18:16.428
That's edible.

18:16.512 --> 18:19.056
-It's delicious!
-[chef 2] It is. It's delicious.

18:19.223 --> 18:21.183
-[chef 3] That's so good.
-[sniffs]

18:21.475 --> 18:28.190
Sean and I met in 1997 at Peninsula Grill
in Charleston, South Carolina.

18:29.149 --> 18:33.195
First impression of Sean was how serious
he was about being a chef.

18:34.738 --> 18:37.574
Sean worked at Peninsula Grill,
went to school,

18:37.658 --> 18:39.952
and, on his days off,
he worked at another restaurant.

18:40.035 --> 18:41.620
I remember asking him,
"Don't you need a day off?"

18:41.703 --> 18:43.038
He's like, "No, all I wanna do is work."

18:46.834 --> 18:52.339
[Brock] I was insane about learning,
about trying to master my craft,

18:52.422 --> 18:56.760
trying to make the knife cuts perfect,
the sauces perfect.

18:57.427 --> 18:59.221
That was my source of pride.

18:59.304 --> 19:03.392
But when I discovered modern cooking,
that changed everything.

19:03.475 --> 19:05.060
Yeah, it's translucent, it's beautiful...

19:05.144 --> 19:08.355
[Brock] The idea that I could
manipulate ingredients

19:08.438 --> 19:14.236
into this magical experience.
That was incredible to me.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.868
No one was cooking Southern food that way.

19:22.202 --> 19:25.789
And so modern cooking
became my new obsession.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.465
[Edge] I remember the first time
I heard about Sean.

19:35.841 --> 19:37.551
He was a molecular wunderkind,

19:37.926 --> 19:42.431
this kind of experimental chef,
doing ham-fat cotton candy.

19:43.557 --> 19:47.769
Playful, inventive food that surprised.

19:51.899 --> 19:55.402
I saw him one time
with some barbeque sandwiches

19:56.320 --> 19:57.738
and liquid nitrogen.

19:58.989 --> 20:02.075
And he had been
steeping the sandwiches in milk,

20:02.492 --> 20:05.829
and then slowly began to make,
on the back of his pickup truck,

20:05.913 --> 20:08.498
while drinking whisky from a bottle...

20:09.208 --> 20:12.961
He began to plunk out little pellets
of barbecue ice cream.

20:16.882 --> 20:20.802
And I saw, in that moment,
kind of the beginnings of Sean.

20:22.429 --> 20:26.808
He was the guy on a path to figure out
who he is and what he wants to cook.

20:55.420 --> 20:56.463
[chef] Grab the nicest one.

20:57.673 --> 20:58.507
[Brock] Yes.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.176
Will you grab a flower?

21:02.135 --> 21:03.095
[chef] Whoo!

21:04.930 --> 21:09.476
[Brock] The first time I was hired
as the head chef of a restaurant

21:09.559 --> 21:13.313
was at the Hermitage Hotel,
Nashville, Tennessee.

21:14.189 --> 21:19.236
And I was 24, and it was the first time
I'd really had the freedom

21:19.319 --> 21:21.530
to create my own plate of food.

21:22.572 --> 21:24.992
My own menu. My own vision.

21:25.075 --> 21:26.243
I could do whatever I wanted.

21:30.289 --> 21:33.041
I was so excited to show off.

21:33.959 --> 21:37.879
And so, when we opened the restaurant,
our tasting menu was 30 courses.

21:39.673 --> 21:44.344
I had this idea that modern Southern food
could be this amazing thing.

21:46.305 --> 21:47.973
We opened on Valentine's Day.

21:48.557 --> 21:52.060
We booked 275 guests,

21:52.394 --> 21:55.522
and I think we fed about 50 people.

21:58.692 --> 22:00.569
To be standing
in the middle of that kitchen,

22:00.944 --> 22:04.948
watching food just be overcooked
and thrown in the garbage,

22:05.032 --> 22:06.825
and food coming back, and...

22:06.908 --> 22:10.454
the people who hired me to do that job
standing there just like...

22:11.788 --> 22:13.123
"We made a mistake."

22:19.421 --> 22:23.425
That feeling was terrible.
I mean, it was just terrible.

22:25.927 --> 22:28.263
A few days later, the review comes out.

22:36.980 --> 22:40.359
I felt such guilt and shame.

22:41.610 --> 22:47.741
I've never ever wanted to quit something
so bad in my entire life.

22:50.369 --> 22:56.208
But instead, I walked in the next day
and I apologized,

22:57.000 --> 22:58.627
and I said,

23:00.087 --> 23:03.673
"I'm not gonna take another day off
until we get a good review."

23:05.675 --> 23:09.388
I was determined to figure out
how to execute my vision

23:09.471 --> 23:12.474
to prove myself worthy of that job.

23:16.228 --> 23:19.272
I worked for ten months straight,
every day.

23:20.273 --> 23:21.691
I didn't leave the kitchen.

23:22.275 --> 23:28.156
I slept under tables with mops as pillows,
and I was living in the kitchen.

23:29.157 --> 23:31.785
Perfectionism was all I cared about.

23:33.412 --> 23:37.999
Every single aspect of every single thing
had to be done my way,

23:38.083 --> 23:39.042
[sizzling]

23:39.251 --> 23:40.752
and I wasn't very nice about it.

23:42.921 --> 23:46.716
I would get so mad
when people wanted to take days off.

23:47.717 --> 23:52.764
I couldn't understand why
no one else cared as much as I cared.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.684
It's important to watch
the color of the smoke.

23:57.519 --> 24:00.605
Pretty much the entire kitchen staff quit.

24:04.776 --> 24:05.986
But I couldn't fail.

24:06.403 --> 24:07.737
I couldn't fail.

24:09.739 --> 24:13.660
Ten months later, the paper in Nashville
came back to the restaurant.

24:15.078 --> 24:21.710
And so, I sat outside of the place
where the papers were being printed,

24:21.793 --> 24:23.795
until 4:00 or 5:00 in the morning.

24:36.224 --> 24:39.561
That ten months of extreme workaholism...

24:40.145 --> 24:41.354
It worked.

24:43.690 --> 24:45.859
And so that was the way I worked.

24:45.942 --> 24:47.694
That was the way I thought.

24:47.777 --> 24:51.364
That was the way
I expected everyone else to feel.

25:02.209 --> 25:03.793
[pigs grunting]

25:04.503 --> 25:06.129
[farmer smacking lips]

25:10.175 --> 25:11.468
What's up, Mother hog?

25:17.641 --> 25:19.809
Can't believe there's still greenage.
[chuckles]

25:19.893 --> 25:20.852
[Brock] Right?

25:21.603 --> 25:23.730
-I got this pig from John Foltz.
-[Brock chuckles]

25:23.813 --> 25:26.650
[farmer] Alabama is her name.
She's an iron-age pig.

25:26.733 --> 25:31.571
It's, uh... basically an Ossabaw
crossed with a Meishan

25:31.655 --> 25:35.283
and some other mixes.
Carl Blake, out of...

25:35.367 --> 25:38.537
out of, uh, Iowa, was doin 'em.

25:40.914 --> 25:42.666
What an amazing creature.

25:42.749 --> 25:45.418
-Four hundred years, it's been here.
-[farmer] Right?

25:47.295 --> 25:48.838
[Brock] What'll you do with the Hereford?

25:48.922 --> 25:51.883
I'm just using it to cross
with our Ossabaws.

25:51.967 --> 25:55.804
People are so used to pink, white pork.
Big, fat portions.

25:55.887 --> 25:56.930
No fat.

25:57.013 --> 25:58.431
No inner muscular fat.

25:58.515 --> 26:01.351
You can't take a grocery store pork chop

26:01.434 --> 26:04.521
and cook it in a skillet now
without burning the shit out of it.

26:04.604 --> 26:07.732
Whereas, you took
a heritage-breed hog pork chop, uh...

26:07.816 --> 26:10.443
throw it in there
and just add salt and pepper,

26:10.527 --> 26:11.695
its own fat.

26:11.778 --> 26:13.238
I worked on this breed for years

26:13.321 --> 26:15.490
and we ended up calling it
"Berkawata-Derokaball"

26:15.574 --> 26:19.744
Everybody that raises pigs
thinks they're gonna create a "super pig."

26:19.828 --> 26:21.329
Yeah, I was trying to do that.

26:21.413 --> 26:26.001
Yeah, I've met ten pig friend farmers
on Facebook and all the social medias,

26:26.084 --> 26:28.837
and they've all got the "super pig."
You know?

26:28.920 --> 26:31.923
So, it's really... That is pretty comical.

26:33.049 --> 26:34.467
This brings back a lot of memory

26:34.551 --> 26:37.429
of running through all this,
chasing pigs for the hell of it.

26:37.512 --> 26:39.472
[farmer] Right? Time flies.

26:39.556 --> 26:41.099
[Brock laughs]

26:53.737 --> 26:55.030
[indistinct chatter]

27:05.832 --> 27:09.502
[Brock] After three years
at the Hermitage Hotel,

27:10.128 --> 27:12.464
I started wondering about the next step.

27:13.006 --> 27:16.676
When an opportunity came up to be the chef
at McCrady's,

27:16.968 --> 27:18.595
the best restaurant in Charleston,

27:18.678 --> 27:24.559
I was so excited to show off my vision
of modern Southern food to this city.

27:26.478 --> 27:32.108
But when I arrived, I was frustrated
with the produce that was available.

27:32.692 --> 27:34.569
The varietals that I wanted.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.488
The quality that I wanted.

27:36.571 --> 27:39.366
I was trying to push
this cuisine into the future.

27:40.700 --> 27:43.578
And that can't happen
if the ingredients don't exist.

27:44.496 --> 27:47.290
And that's when I met Glenn Roberts,

27:47.916 --> 27:51.628
the seedsman who was restoring
the pantry of the Lowcountry.

27:51.711 --> 27:53.755
[indistinct chatter]

27:55.674 --> 28:00.095
[Roberts] Here, we have 4,000-year-old
different rices from Africa.

28:00.178 --> 28:03.973
They're salt-tolerant, water-tolerant,
disease-tolerant and they're fast.

28:04.057 --> 28:05.642
Wicked fast.

28:05.725 --> 28:07.560
-See the milk?
-[Brock] Wow. Did you see that?

28:07.644 --> 28:08.937
[Roberts] Yeah. Try that one.

28:11.189 --> 28:13.441
-It, like, exploded milk.
-[Roberts] Yeah.

28:13.525 --> 28:14.901
-[man] It's awesome, isn't it?
-Wow!

28:14.984 --> 28:18.947
[Roberts] And you can take the leaves,
juice them, and then dye the rice kernels.

28:19.030 --> 28:20.657
[Brock] That's really cool.

28:23.410 --> 28:30.208
Glenn knew that in order to revive
the cuisine of the Lowcountry,

28:31.668 --> 28:36.131
you have to start with the specific
varietals of the Carolina rice kitchen.

28:40.385 --> 28:42.429
[Dennis] To understand Charleston cuisine,

28:42.512 --> 28:46.683
you have to understand its roots,
which is based in West Africa.

28:50.770 --> 28:53.857
It's a very layered cuisine,
heavily influenced by rice,

28:53.940 --> 28:56.776
because obviously rice made
a lot of people in the city rich

28:56.860 --> 29:00.405
through the knowledge
of enslaved West Africans.

29:02.490 --> 29:06.536
Those who were enslaved
brought their knowledge of rice culture,

29:08.121 --> 29:09.998
the okra, the greens,

29:10.081 --> 29:13.543
these different vegetables
that we see on that Southern table.

29:21.092 --> 29:24.637
[Edge] All these crops
of West African origin

29:24.721 --> 29:27.140
or West African expertise

29:27.223 --> 29:31.978
are what made dishes that are dependent
upon rice for their backbone,

29:32.061 --> 29:38.318
like Hoppin' John, like Limpin' Susan,
so specific to Charleston.

29:39.652 --> 29:42.864
But we lost these ingredients
after the Civil War,

29:43.281 --> 29:48.203
when people of West African descent
quit the rice fields for jobs in the city,

29:48.787 --> 29:52.749
or moved the hell out of South Carolina
and went to Philadelphia and New York.

29:53.625 --> 29:55.585
And that's justice.

29:55.668 --> 29:58.004
Right? That's progress.

29:59.214 --> 30:00.298
And yet...

30:01.174 --> 30:06.638
if you value the agricultural knowledge
that West African peoples brought,

30:06.721 --> 30:09.682
and then nurtured in the American South,
in the Lowcountry...

30:12.727 --> 30:14.729
you do lament that loss of knowledge.

30:15.647 --> 30:21.611
You do lament that loss of beauty
in those rice kitchen dishes.

30:25.949 --> 30:30.370
It's complicated. Like everything
about the South, it's complicated.

30:36.417 --> 30:38.753
[man] What do you usually roast it in?

30:39.128 --> 30:42.090
[Brock] My favorite way is roasted
in a cast iron pan with a little lard.

30:42.465 --> 30:44.884
-That's it. [chuckles]
-Lard's the best.

30:45.218 --> 30:47.220
[Brock] That's how you can convert
okra haters.

30:47.470 --> 30:49.305
-[plants rustling]
-[beans pouring]

30:56.813 --> 30:58.565
-Smells like roasted okra.
-[chef] Yeah.

31:02.277 --> 31:06.322
[Brock] I had to be a part of putting
these varietals that were nearly extinct

31:06.406 --> 31:08.908
back into production,
back on to the plate.

31:09.409 --> 31:11.661
Yeah. Unbelievable. Shit, that's good.

31:11.911 --> 31:14.414
I was going from farm to farm to farm.

31:15.248 --> 31:17.584
"These are the seeds we have to grow.

31:18.668 --> 31:21.921
Plant. Plant. Plant. I'll buy everything.
I'll buy it all."

31:23.006 --> 31:27.260
And, little by little, our pantry
was being stocked with ingredients

31:27.343 --> 31:29.971
that were unique and true to this place.

31:30.722 --> 31:34.559
And I was able
to push this cuisine forward.

31:36.352 --> 31:40.565
And the food got crazier and crazier,
and, for me, more fun.

31:49.532 --> 31:52.744
All of a sudden, the restaurant's
gaining a lot of attention.

31:53.494 --> 31:55.788
People were traveling
from outside of Charleston

31:55.872 --> 31:58.541
to come see
what was happening at McCrady's.

32:10.929 --> 32:13.348
In 2010, I got nominated

32:13.431 --> 32:17.518
for the James Beard Award
for, uh, Best Chef: Southeast.

32:18.645 --> 32:20.355
And I won.

32:27.946 --> 32:32.992
I had shown to the world that
modern Southern food could be amazing.

32:41.292 --> 32:42.502
[door squeaks]

32:55.431 --> 32:58.685
At McCrady's, I was so focused

32:58.768 --> 33:02.605
on creativity and being different,

33:03.439 --> 33:06.109
I thought I had to be
in the kitchen all the time.

33:06.192 --> 33:11.406
But I kept hearing these romantic stories
from farmers about seed saving

33:12.198 --> 33:14.993
and the pride that came along with that.

33:15.702 --> 33:17.662
I had to experience that for myself.

33:20.498 --> 33:23.209
And so, I found a plot of dirt,

33:24.210 --> 33:25.962
begged Glenn for seeds.

33:27.880 --> 33:29.465
He gave me a few ears

33:29.841 --> 33:35.263
of this beautiful, super dark,
almost black-red corn

33:36.097 --> 33:40.601
that was almost extinct,
called Jimmy Red Corn.

33:44.397 --> 33:49.193
And every day I would wake up at 6:00
and just work on the garden.

33:51.529 --> 33:55.992
Being back in the sun,
watching that corn grow,

33:56.451 --> 33:59.245
taking care of it, worrying about it

34:00.913 --> 34:03.666
was a part of the puzzle
that'd been missing since I was a kid.

34:06.085 --> 34:08.880
And I fell in love with dirt again.

34:14.427 --> 34:17.263
That first pan of cornbread I made

34:17.346 --> 34:22.393
felt just like eating
at my grandmother's table.

34:22.560 --> 34:25.188
And it just came full circle.

34:34.864 --> 34:38.451
I knew what I needed to do
and what path I needed to take.

34:40.078 --> 34:44.415
And a few months later, we opened Husk.

34:53.341 --> 34:55.134
At Husk, our mission

34:55.218 --> 35:00.640
was to celebrate simple, soulful
Southern recipes and traditions,

35:00.723 --> 35:02.183
just like my grandmother did.

35:06.646 --> 35:10.024
The defining principle at Husk
since its inception has been,

35:10.108 --> 35:12.443
"If it's not Southern,
it's not walking in the door."

35:16.280 --> 35:18.658
[Brock] When you can't just
pick up the phone

35:18.741 --> 35:22.411
and order balsamic vinegar from Italy
and olive oil from Spain,

35:23.162 --> 35:25.039
you make your own.

35:25.748 --> 35:27.416
You study the traditions.

35:28.084 --> 35:33.631
And so we started making our own vinegars
and oils and salts

35:34.507 --> 35:36.008
and grinding our own flours.

35:39.679 --> 35:42.473
And it was so much better than anything
we ever cooked with.

35:44.308 --> 35:48.479
We became collectors,
scouting the South for ingredients.

35:51.315 --> 35:54.527
It felt we were doing something
that had meaning.

35:55.111 --> 35:57.446
It felt like it needed to be done.

35:58.990 --> 36:02.034
And I ate it up.
I couldn't get enough of it.

36:04.912 --> 36:08.082
[Edge] There's this rediscovery
of Southern food that's pinned to Sean.

36:08.916 --> 36:10.918
He helped revive.

36:11.544 --> 36:13.296
He helped to re-frame.

36:14.088 --> 36:17.508
He helped us see again
the value of these foods.

36:17.800 --> 36:18.926
Wow!

36:19.010 --> 36:21.971
That vote of confidence
for the South meant a lot

36:22.054 --> 36:24.265
when Sean shouted it
through his megaphone.

36:32.523 --> 36:35.735
[Brock] And not long after
we opened Husk in Charleston,

36:36.068 --> 36:40.406
Bon Appétit  named us
the best new restaurant in America.

36:42.116 --> 36:44.493
That's when everything took off.

36:45.286 --> 36:47.788
Life was moving a thousand miles an hour.

36:54.629 --> 36:57.757
I was running back and forth
between Husk and McCrady's,

36:58.633 --> 37:01.636
cooking for 500 people a day.

37:06.140 --> 37:08.893
People were paying attention
to Southern food,

37:08.976 --> 37:12.730
becoming interested on a different level.
It was exhilarating.

37:20.696 --> 37:24.242
In a two-year period,
I opened four restaurants.

37:24.784 --> 37:27.370
At that point of my life
was a lot of running around.

37:28.120 --> 37:31.457
Cameras in my face and every word printed.

37:32.041 --> 37:34.669
My role as a chef in the South had grown.

37:37.505 --> 37:40.675
I was representing
a cuisine and a culture.

37:41.759 --> 37:43.469
That's an enormous amount of pressure.

37:44.220 --> 37:46.722
And so, I just worked harder.

38:18.796 --> 38:23.968
One day, I woke up
and stood up out of bed,

38:24.760 --> 38:27.513
and it felt like the room was spinning.

38:30.599 --> 38:33.269
I'd lost my balance.
I had to sit back down.

38:33.352 --> 38:38.649
And when I opened my eyes again,
uh, I couldn't focus my vision.

38:39.442 --> 38:40.318
I was seeing double.

38:44.196 --> 38:45.364
I couldn't do anything.

38:46.282 --> 38:51.537
The first time in my entire career,
I didn't wake up and go straight to work.

38:52.038 --> 38:53.122
I was helpless.

38:55.499 --> 38:59.086
But all the doctors I saw
were just stumped.

38:59.170 --> 39:01.130
They couldn't understand
what was going on.

39:02.173 --> 39:04.633
That's when the surgeries began.

39:06.927 --> 39:10.765
A spoon popped into my eyeballs
while I'm awake,

39:12.350 --> 39:17.229
hearing and smelling and feeling them
cutting away at my eyelids,

39:18.522 --> 39:21.567
lying on the couch
with ice pads on my eyes

39:21.650 --> 39:23.903
and blood dripping down my face.

39:26.447 --> 39:28.574
I had six surgeries total,

39:28.657 --> 39:32.203
and the double vision and droopy eyelids
just kept coming back.

39:33.120 --> 39:35.206
It was like a horror movie.

39:38.542 --> 39:41.712
And this is keeping me from working.

39:42.546 --> 39:44.715
And that was making me crazy.

39:46.258 --> 39:50.054
I just became so angry at the world.

39:51.472 --> 39:56.268
I was so frustrated and scared to death,

39:57.436 --> 40:00.272
just thinking, "Am I never gonna
be able to cook again?"

40:02.650 --> 40:08.823
And the only coping mechanism I had
to equalize or to numb

40:08.906 --> 40:12.368
was a garage full of bourbon.

40:12.952 --> 40:16.831
I didn't know what to do.
What am I supposed to do?

40:27.007 --> 40:29.051
-[woman] Hey, Sean, how are you?
-[Brock] Hey. Great.

40:30.094 --> 40:31.095
[woman] Come on back.

40:38.602 --> 40:41.147
Good, good, good. Take a look at my nose.

40:43.858 --> 40:46.652
[Brock] Almost two years passed,
not working,

40:47.111 --> 40:52.575
just miserable, until I finally flew
to the Mayo Clinic.

40:53.701 --> 40:56.328
We did a number of tests,

40:57.371 --> 40:59.540
and the neurologist says,

40:59.623 --> 41:00.916
"This...

41:02.084 --> 41:05.045
sounds and seems like myasthenia gravis,

41:05.129 --> 41:10.384
the really rare disease that affects
neuro-muscular communication."

41:11.302 --> 41:15.222
This disease is exacerbated
by stress and fatigue.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.142
There's no cure for this

41:18.225 --> 41:22.605
other than controlling stress,
controlling anxiety.

41:23.272 --> 41:27.568
But to treat the symptoms,
the doctor gave me a bunch of pills,

41:28.360 --> 41:31.113
and I immediately started feeling better.

41:37.203 --> 41:38.329
My vision was perfect.

41:38.954 --> 41:42.750
My eyelids were perfect.
I felt like Superman.

41:44.960 --> 41:49.757
To be able to use a knife again
was such an amazing feeling.

41:51.091 --> 41:54.845
I had a year and a half of ideas pent up,

41:55.471 --> 41:58.307
a year and a half of dishes
swimming around in my head.

41:58.516 --> 42:02.603
So, I just started cooking like crazy

42:03.103 --> 42:07.107
and being back in the kitchen
was incredible.

42:09.610 --> 42:13.489
[Noe] He basically dove back in
full force and beyond full force,

42:13.989 --> 42:17.076
in, just, this desperation
to make up for lost time.

42:19.286 --> 42:23.040
But he was on something
like 16 mg of prednisone,

42:23.123 --> 42:25.042
and that can make
anyone feel like Superman.

42:26.794 --> 42:29.421
[Brock] I thought I had
everything under control,

42:32.216 --> 42:35.928
and then, one day, I was driving to work,

42:36.011 --> 42:40.349
and my vision just snapped
and went straight into double vision.

42:44.979 --> 42:47.064
The pills had stopped working,

42:47.147 --> 42:50.609
and, the next day, my doctor told me

42:50.693 --> 42:55.948
the myasthenia was graduating
from my eyes into full-body myasthenia.

42:57.116 --> 42:59.994
And that was really bad news,

43:01.829 --> 43:07.960
because, when that happens, the future is
living with tubes down your throat.

43:08.043 --> 43:09.295
And, uh...

43:11.422 --> 43:16.093
I, um, just hit a level of depression

43:16.176 --> 43:18.679
that, uh, I'd never experienced before,

43:19.346 --> 43:22.182
and I drowned my pain in bourbon.

43:24.602 --> 43:28.814
I was in the depths
of misery at that point.

43:30.733 --> 43:34.528
I stopped caring. I just gave up.

43:38.198 --> 43:41.160
He wasn't himself.
He had a vacant look in his eye.

43:41.243 --> 43:46.624
He was beyond
just needing to see a therapist.

43:48.584 --> 43:50.169
[Edge] There was a darkness about him.

43:50.753 --> 43:52.921
He was grappling
with stuff I didn't understand.

43:55.799 --> 43:59.928
There was something missing there, like...
He needed help.

44:00.012 --> 44:01.972
That was, uh...
He was crying out for help.

44:05.309 --> 44:09.480
[Brock] I remember I was upstairs
and my doorbell rang.

44:09.980 --> 44:13.484
I opened the door and there were
three people standing there

44:13.567 --> 44:16.320
that weren't supposed
to be standing there...

44:17.613 --> 44:22.159
three people standing there
that I respect.

44:23.702 --> 44:26.705
They were trembling, full-body trembles.

44:28.165 --> 44:30.334
I knew exactly what was happening.

44:31.001 --> 44:33.504
And I...

44:36.006 --> 44:40.803
felt this amazing, uh, relief,
to be quite honest.

44:42.554 --> 44:47.643
It was almost like...
like the, the help had arrived.

44:48.936 --> 44:50.187
And, uh...

44:55.150 --> 45:00.322
we all sit down at a table
to have an intervention,

45:00.614 --> 45:03.200
and I remember saying,
"You can do whatever you want.

45:03.283 --> 45:07.246
You can read whatever you want,
but I am going.

45:08.163 --> 45:11.500
I will go right now."

45:11.583 --> 45:13.585
[distant thunder]

45:44.158 --> 45:46.827
Thirty-nine, I am.
Thirty-nine years old.

45:47.661 --> 45:51.540
The same age my father was
when he passed away.

45:57.755 --> 46:02.968
I nearly broke myself,
trying to save Southern food,

46:03.886 --> 46:07.264
but you can't save anything
when you're dead.

46:14.271 --> 46:18.901
When I got to rehab, I didn't have
work and whisky to hide behind.

46:20.527 --> 46:22.571
I had to face the person in the mirror.

46:24.156 --> 46:30.120
I realized that my desire to always be
at work is exactly how my father was.

46:32.623 --> 46:38.504
The moment that I knew it didn't have
to be that way anymore was unbelievable.

46:39.463 --> 46:41.465
[insects chirping]

46:43.217 --> 46:44.718
[birds chirping]

46:48.305 --> 46:51.058
I was standing in the grass,

46:51.141 --> 46:57.064
admiring the sky,
and how green the grass was,

46:57.439 --> 47:00.943
and I could hear the birds again,
and I was like,

47:01.026 --> 47:01.944
"Whoa.

47:03.570 --> 47:04.571
I'm awake."

47:08.867 --> 47:12.913
I saw that connection
between taking care of myself,

47:12.996 --> 47:17.918
and how that affects my disease,
which affects my happiness.

47:20.295 --> 47:22.381
My vision was fine.

47:22.923 --> 47:24.550
My muscles were fine.

47:25.509 --> 47:27.803
It was such an amazing feeling.

47:30.597 --> 47:35.477
But the new perspective
that I have takes...

47:35.978 --> 47:39.523
an enormous amount of work every day.

47:42.693 --> 47:43.861
To slow down...

47:44.611 --> 47:46.196
That's difficult for me.

47:51.034 --> 47:53.370
[whistles] Dakota, refill.

47:54.997 --> 47:57.666
[Brock] And if I skip self-care,

47:58.876 --> 48:02.671
I feel the old Sean creeping back in.

48:06.592 --> 48:08.427
He'll be there for a long time,

48:09.136 --> 48:12.306
in the parking lot, doing push-ups,
waiting for that moment.

48:14.933 --> 48:18.020
[sniffs] Smells like Willett Distillery.
[chuckles]

48:18.103 --> 48:19.146
[sniffs]

48:19.813 --> 48:22.149
-How long you gonna let this one go?
-Two months.

48:22.816 --> 48:24.943
-Yeah, that's alcohol. Whoo!
-Yeah.

48:26.486 --> 48:28.572
-Hello, old friend.
-[both laugh]

48:29.823 --> 48:32.576
Now the trick is to keep that edge,

48:32.659 --> 48:35.537
to keep that passion,
to keep that intensity

48:35.621 --> 48:36.747
while taking care of myself.

48:37.497 --> 48:39.082
[laughing]

48:39.166 --> 48:41.835
Now my goal is happiness,

48:42.628 --> 48:47.841
and the food that is created now
is the best food I've ever cooked.

48:55.641 --> 48:58.852
[man] When I was a kid,
the triggerfish was actually shack money.

48:58.936 --> 49:01.897
If they only knew now
what they were missing.

49:12.824 --> 49:15.953
[Roberts] Carolina Gold Rice
was here prior to 1863.

49:16.036 --> 49:18.163
-[Brock] It's like a time vault.
-[Roberts] It's like a time capsule.

49:18.246 --> 49:19.164
Exactly.

49:28.674 --> 49:29.591
[man] Nice.

49:30.550 --> 49:32.094
That'll be delicious with a little butter.

49:43.647 --> 49:45.565
[inaudible]

50:19.307 --> 50:21.685
-[speaks indistinctly]
-[Brock chuckles]

50:37.117 --> 50:38.869
[Brock] This corn is just like me.

50:38.952 --> 50:41.246
It started in Appalachia
and ended up in the Lowcountry.

51:07.606 --> 51:09.608
[birds chirping]

51:16.782 --> 51:18.617
[man] Audrey Morgan's bean.

51:21.620 --> 51:22.704
[Brock] I know these.

51:31.129 --> 51:33.256
I'll never forget that time
I brought my mom here.

51:34.674 --> 51:37.302
-We were doin' a talk.
-We were doin' that talk, and then, uh...

51:37.886 --> 51:40.639
-That brought her to tears--
-I looked over, and my mom was crying.

51:40.722 --> 51:43.725
I was like, "Uh, what just happened?"
And then I saw...

51:43.809 --> 51:44.935
What did I say? [laughing]

51:45.018 --> 51:46.603
...my grandma's name sittin' there.

51:46.937 --> 51:49.731
-That's the power of it all.
-[laughs] I know it. It is.

51:51.608 --> 51:54.903
[Brock] Someday, I hope to see these
on menus all over the South.

51:54.986 --> 51:56.655
[man] Wouldn't that be something?

51:56.738 --> 52:00.617
[Brock] The thought of these being served
in restaurants all over the South

52:00.742 --> 52:03.954
and my grandma's name being mentioned
every time...

52:04.037 --> 52:07.332
[stutters] That's legacy. That's her life.

52:07.415 --> 52:10.210
That was her passion, these things.

52:12.129 --> 52:14.923
That's better than a monument
in the middle of the town square.

52:15.006 --> 52:17.384
[Brock] Yeah, it is.
I appreciate what you do.

52:17.467 --> 52:20.137
[man] Well, I love it.
That's the whole purpose.

52:24.599 --> 52:25.809
[Brock] Oh, wow.

52:26.434 --> 52:28.520
[man] That's it. See that?
You recognize that?

52:28.603 --> 52:29.938
[Brock] Man, look at that.

52:31.731 --> 52:34.693
I'll be able to spend the rest of my life

52:35.318 --> 52:40.448
on this crazy journey
of rediscovering Southern food

52:41.032 --> 52:42.284
and what it can be.

52:44.327 --> 52:47.414
And there's no way to know
what's gonna happen a year from now.

52:47.789 --> 52:50.167
There's just no way, but...

52:50.625 --> 52:52.586
today is today.

52:52.669 --> 52:53.837
And...

52:55.505 --> 52:56.840
today is a good day.

53:07.642 --> 53:09.644
[music playing]
