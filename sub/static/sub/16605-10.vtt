00:04.204 --> 00:06.138
(WIND WHISTLING)

00:06.140 --> 00:08.640
Even though we still have
some preparation to do

00:08.642 --> 00:11.677
before we strike
the Empire's factory
on Lothal,

00:11.679 --> 00:15.381
MALE VOICE: <i> Ezra.</i>
I want to do a thorough recon
trip to update our intel.

00:15.383 --> 00:17.883
There's no need
for the full squadron.
A small unit should

00:17.885 --> 00:19.785
be able to handle this.
<i>Ezra.</i>

00:23.123 --> 00:25.624
I'm assigning you
the mission, Ezra.
<i>Ezra.</i>

00:26.826 --> 00:29.528
HERA: Ezra?
(GASPS)

00:29.530 --> 00:32.197
Care to join the briefing?
Sorry.

00:32.199 --> 00:35.134
Yeah. No, it's just I...
I thought I saw something.

00:35.136 --> 00:38.470
This is your mission, Ezra.
I need your full attention.

00:38.472 --> 00:40.072
Yeah, you've got it. Sorry.

00:40.074 --> 00:42.741
All right. So first,
you'll slip into the system

00:42.743 --> 00:44.643
and study the Empire's
orbital defenses.

00:44.645 --> 00:46.378
<i>Ezra.</i>
We'll keep our distance,

00:46.380 --> 00:47.679
but gather all
the data we can.

00:47.681 --> 00:49.014
I want Destroyer positions,

00:49.016 --> 00:50.682
TIE patrol routes,
transport schedules...

(GASPS)

00:56.056 --> 00:57.823
Something wrong?

00:57.825 --> 00:59.725
No, I... I just...

00:59.727 --> 01:01.093
I thought
I saw something,

01:01.095 --> 01:02.594
or someone.

01:02.596 --> 01:05.697
The recon team leaves
as soon as we're loaded up.
Questions?

01:05.699 --> 01:07.699
Is Admiral Thrawn there?

01:07.701 --> 01:09.701
We have reports
of an increase
in capital ships,

01:09.703 --> 01:12.337
but no confirmation as to
whether he's there or not.
<i>Ezra.</i>

01:15.175 --> 01:16.775
Ezra, what is it?

01:18.878 --> 01:21.213
Hey, kid.
You feeling all right?

01:21.215 --> 01:22.347
There! Look!

01:22.349 --> 01:24.016
What am I looking at?

01:25.251 --> 01:27.186
You don't look very good.

01:27.188 --> 01:28.320
Ezra, what do you see?

01:28.955 --> 01:30.589
Ezra!

01:32.425 --> 01:33.625
(GASPS)

01:33.627 --> 01:35.394
Ezra!

01:35.396 --> 01:37.729
Kanan, what's going on?
I don't know.
I don't know!

01:37.731 --> 01:39.698
ZEB: Ezra,
can you hear me? Ezra!

01:45.305 --> 01:46.772
KANAN: Wake up.
(GASPS)

01:46.774 --> 01:50.776
Whoa, Ezra.
It's okay. You're safe.

01:50.778 --> 01:53.011
You want to tell us
what's going on?

01:56.950 --> 01:58.250
It was Maul.

01:58.252 --> 02:00.085
You mean,
at the briefing?

02:00.087 --> 02:02.421
I saw him.

02:02.423 --> 02:04.556
He said my name.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.158
He was right behind me.

02:06.160 --> 02:07.893
I mean, he was right there.

02:07.895 --> 02:10.896
Kid, I was standing
next to you.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.764
There was
nobody else there.

02:12.766 --> 02:15.801
Maybe it was some kind
of, uh, Force vision.

02:15.803 --> 02:19.104
Mmm, maybe.

02:19.106 --> 02:23.509
Ah. If you ask me,
the kid's just been
working too hard.

02:23.511 --> 02:25.644

02:25.646 --> 02:28.013
Chopper, stop it.
(GRUNTS)

02:28.015 --> 02:31.683
No, Chop's right.
Nap time's over.
I should get back to work.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.418
You sure
you're all right?

02:33.420 --> 02:37.789
Hera, I feel fine.
I just had a bad something.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.691
No reason to stop
the rebellion, right?

02:39.693 --> 02:42.528
Come on, Sabine.
We gotta get ready
for our mission.

02:47.367 --> 02:49.434
Tell me what
you're thinking, Kanan.

02:49.436 --> 02:53.105
I'm thinking
whatever Ezra went
through with Maul,

02:53.107 --> 02:55.073
it's not over yet.

02:58.811 --> 03:03.282
Stop. We have
all the proton torpedoes
we need for this mission.

03:03.284 --> 03:06.118
Well, not according
to the weapons expert,
which is me.

03:06.120 --> 03:08.687
I want two more cases
of 'em loaded up.

03:08.689 --> 03:11.890
Why am I
the last one to know
about supply changes?

03:11.892 --> 03:14.493
I cannot work
under these conditions.

03:14.495 --> 03:17.863
Ugh, it's like AP-5
and Chopper were made
on the same assembly line.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.865
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)

03:19.867 --> 03:21.900
Oh, I'm the one who needs
an attitude adjustment?

03:23.036 --> 03:25.671
It's him. I... It's Maul.

03:25.673 --> 03:27.039
Ezra?

03:27.041 --> 03:28.540
Hey, Ezra!

03:28.542 --> 03:31.743
Ezra?
Chop, go get Kanan.
(GRUNTS)

03:31.745 --> 03:34.079
Out of the way!
There he is!

03:34.081 --> 03:36.315
I see him.

03:36.317 --> 03:39.318
(SINISTER LAUGHING)

03:39.320 --> 03:40.919
Ezra. Stop!

03:48.394 --> 03:50.229
(LAUGHING CONTINUES)

03:53.333 --> 03:54.933
I knew it!

03:57.670 --> 03:59.104
Ezra!

04:01.874 --> 04:05.310
Ezra, wait!
Let me go!

04:11.918 --> 04:13.552
Kanan!
What are you doing?

04:13.554 --> 04:15.754
Ezra! It's not Maul!
Look at him!

04:15.756 --> 04:19.124
(GASPING) You're out
of your mind, kid!

04:20.927 --> 04:23.528
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

04:25.632 --> 04:27.699
What's happening to me?

04:31.571 --> 04:34.573
Maybe I should
postpone the mission,
stay here with him.

04:34.575 --> 04:37.442
Ezra will be fine.
I've got a plan.

04:37.444 --> 04:40.212
(SIGHS) Be careful, Kanan.

04:40.214 --> 04:41.880
We will.

04:53.393 --> 04:55.294
I'm surprised
she got on the ship.

04:55.296 --> 04:57.829
I told her I had a plan.
Really?

04:57.831 --> 05:01.300
And she left anyway?
Very funny. Come on.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.274
Ezra's wrist com?

05:09.276 --> 05:12.678
I need you to put a tracker
on it without him knowing.

05:26.659 --> 05:29.027
Bendu.
You knew we were coming.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.996
Yes.

05:30.998 --> 05:34.299
You're not exactly
quiet creatures, hmm?

05:34.301 --> 05:36.368
Tell him what's happening.

05:36.370 --> 05:38.370
The dark side wielder
I told you about,

05:38.372 --> 05:40.972
the one who wanted to join
the holocrons together.

05:40.974 --> 05:43.041
I've seen him
here on Atollon.

05:43.043 --> 05:46.778
I warned you, joining
the holocrons together

05:46.780 --> 05:49.147
could bring both
great wisdom

05:49.149 --> 05:51.450
and great danger.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.819
I know. I felt their power.

05:53.821 --> 05:57.889
And I did see things,
but my vision,
it was incomplete.

05:57.891 --> 06:00.292
Incomplete?

06:00.294 --> 06:03.729
Yeah, I let go
before either of us
got the answers we wanted,

06:03.731 --> 06:05.664
and then the holocrons
were destroyed.

06:05.666 --> 06:09.267
Aha. I see.

06:10.069 --> 06:12.037
Well, that's not good.

06:12.039 --> 06:15.741
What do you mean,
"That's not good"?
What can we do?

06:15.743 --> 06:20.579
What do you want to do, hmm?

06:20.581 --> 06:22.881
I want to stop seeing Maul.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.884
Then don't turn around.

06:38.164 --> 06:41.767
Bendu, what should we do?

06:41.769 --> 06:45.203
This is a strange place.

06:45.205 --> 06:47.272
So remote.

06:47.274 --> 06:52.444
Oh, yes, the Empire
will have a difficult time
finding you here.

06:54.113 --> 06:57.082
Y... You think
I came here to fight?

06:57.084 --> 07:00.352
I came here to speak
with my apprentice.

07:00.354 --> 07:03.889
He's not your apprentice.
Yet.

07:03.891 --> 07:05.724
How did you find me?

07:05.726 --> 07:09.127
When you abruptly
severed our connection
with the holocron,

07:09.129 --> 07:11.730
you mixed up
the information.

07:11.732 --> 07:14.199
You learned a bit
of what I want to know,

07:14.201 --> 07:18.103
and I learned a bit
of what you wanted to know.

07:18.105 --> 07:22.040
But there were fragments
and memories left in my mind.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.376
Like the location
of our base.

07:24.378 --> 07:26.311
Yes. (CHUCKLES)
Very good.

07:26.313 --> 07:28.447
Oh, you do learn fast,
apprentice.

07:28.449 --> 07:30.749
Look, I can't make sense
of what I saw.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.818
I couldn't even describe it
if I wanted to.

07:32.820 --> 07:35.554
And that is why
you need to come with me,

07:35.556 --> 07:38.990
so I can retrieve the answers
which are just out of reach.

07:38.992 --> 07:42.394
So you get your answers,
but what do we
get out of it?

07:42.396 --> 07:46.598
I will keep
your rebel base secret.

07:46.600 --> 07:50.502
No deal. You're not walking
off this rock in one piece.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.604
(CHUCKLING)

07:52.606 --> 07:54.739
I have planted
a beacon nearby.

07:54.741 --> 07:58.143
Strike me down,
and it will activate,

07:58.145 --> 08:01.146
revealing your presence
to the Empire.

08:01.148 --> 08:04.316
You have knowledge
that is rightfully mine.

08:04.318 --> 08:06.985
I have knowledge
that you want.

08:06.987 --> 08:10.989
The key
to defeating the Sith.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.859
What I propose
will satisfy us both.

08:14.994 --> 08:16.428
All right.

08:17.663 --> 08:20.131
Ezra, you're not
doing this.

08:20.133 --> 08:22.167
He's going to expose
Chopper Base.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.302
We'll move,
build a new base.

08:24.304 --> 08:28.139
(SIGHS)
Maul won't hurt me,
Kanan. He needs me.

08:28.141 --> 08:30.609
Besides, this might
be our last chance
to learn the secret

08:30.611 --> 08:32.444
of how we can
destroy the Sith.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.214
(SIGHS)
I do not like this.

08:36.216 --> 08:39.217
But we don't really
have a choice, do we?

08:40.119 --> 08:42.153
I'm gonna trust you
on this.

08:42.155 --> 08:43.221
All right.

08:43.223 --> 08:44.756
We have a deal.

08:49.462 --> 08:52.063
After you, my apprentice.

09:10.883 --> 09:14.152
I'm tracking Ezra's signal.
They just made the jump
to hyperspace.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.588
Let's get going.
I don't wanna lose 'em.

09:33.606 --> 09:35.073
Where are we?

09:35.075 --> 09:39.311
That is Dathomir, my home.

09:53.559 --> 09:57.095
If this is your home,
where are your people?
Where is everybody?

09:57.097 --> 09:59.264
I am the last survivor.

09:59.266 --> 10:03.301
My family, the Nightsisters,
were killed.

10:03.303 --> 10:06.538
Masterful witches they were.

10:06.540 --> 10:08.840
A threat to the Empire.

10:11.978 --> 10:13.945
I know that
you can relate.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.281
These witches,
they use the Force?

10:16.283 --> 10:18.750
Some aspect, yes.

10:18.752 --> 10:23.088
But it was their connection
to this planet
that made them strong.

10:23.090 --> 10:25.323
That is why we are here,

10:25.325 --> 10:29.728
to perform some old magic.

10:29.730 --> 10:33.898
Yes. Yes,
everything that we need
lies within the cave.

10:33.900 --> 10:37.302
I'm not going any further
until you tell me
how this works.

10:37.304 --> 10:41.006
The only way to access
the knowledge we seek

10:41.008 --> 10:42.941
is to merge
our minds again.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.943
The effect will only
last a moment.

10:44.945 --> 10:46.745
Just enough time
for each of us

10:46.747 --> 10:49.280
to find the answers
to our questions.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.316
Trust me, Ezra.

10:51.318 --> 10:55.687
I only want the answers
I deserve, nothing more.

10:55.689 --> 10:57.122
What do we have to do?

10:57.124 --> 10:58.657
Come.

11:08.968 --> 11:11.603
I have gathered many things,

11:11.605 --> 11:15.006
secrets to help us
restore our memories.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.641
Look at all this junk.

11:16.643 --> 11:19.044
Do not touch anything.

11:19.046 --> 11:22.514
These are artifacts
from my past,

11:22.516 --> 11:26.851
from a time when my power
was almost absolute.

11:38.397 --> 11:39.864
Get away from there!

11:39.866 --> 11:41.900
Is that a lightsaber?

11:41.902 --> 11:44.836
Indeed, yes,

11:44.838 --> 11:47.405
but not like any
that you would know.

11:47.407 --> 11:50.208
If your Mandalorian friend
was here,

11:50.210 --> 11:54.412
(CHUCKLES) she could
explain it to you.

12:01.320 --> 12:04.155
Why is Ezra so willing
to trust Maul

12:04.157 --> 12:05.523
again and again?

12:05.525 --> 12:07.525
I don't think he is,

12:07.527 --> 12:10.829
but I do know he's taking
a big risk for all of us.

12:10.831 --> 12:14.265
I have studied the ways
of the Nightsisters

12:14.267 --> 12:17.335
and found a spell
that suits our needs.

12:17.337 --> 12:20.371
This... This altar

12:20.373 --> 12:23.742
is the focus
of their ancient power.

12:26.412 --> 12:29.080
Now, to initiate the merge,

12:29.082 --> 12:32.884
we... We must each
drink this potion.

12:32.886 --> 12:35.754
Mmm, you first.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.363
Mmm.

12:45.365 --> 12:49.067
To complete the spell,
you must drink it all.

12:49.069 --> 12:52.270
Just like me,
all of it.

12:56.442 --> 13:01.079
Mmm, ha. It's working.

13:01.081 --> 13:03.381
(COUGHING)

13:17.396 --> 13:20.465
(BEEPS)
They should be
this way. Come on.

13:22.501 --> 13:24.302
Where is he?

13:24.304 --> 13:26.971
I want to know
how to destroy the Sith.

13:28.474 --> 13:33.444
I see. I understand.

13:33.446 --> 13:35.413
Who is that?

13:35.415 --> 13:37.081
I know him.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.356
(GASPS) Of course.

13:45.358 --> 13:48.459
It ends where it began.

13:48.461 --> 13:52.864
A desert planet
with twin suns.

13:52.866 --> 13:54.465
He's alive.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.935
I... I can't believe
he's alive.

14:02.975 --> 14:06.578
It is time
to pay our debt.

14:07.646 --> 14:09.347
Wait, wait, wait!
What's happening?

14:15.521 --> 14:16.988
(GROWLING)

14:16.990 --> 14:18.122
What is that?

14:18.124 --> 14:19.958
Pay our due.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.459
(GASPS)

14:21.461 --> 14:25.463
The spirits
of the Nightsisters

14:25.465 --> 14:28.199
must be compensated

14:28.201 --> 14:30.501
for the use of their magic.

14:30.503 --> 14:33.371
So pay 'em,
and let's get out of here!

14:33.373 --> 14:35.540
The price is our
flesh and blood!

14:35.542 --> 14:38.042
Don't let them
touch you!
Now you tell me?

14:38.044 --> 14:39.344
Ezra!

14:39.346 --> 14:40.645
Pay our due.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.480
Kanan, Sabine! Stay back!

14:46.752 --> 14:48.653
(SINISTER LAUGHING)

14:49.355 --> 14:50.822
(SCREAMS)

14:51.891 --> 14:53.224
(GASPS)

14:55.761 --> 14:58.229
(LAUGHING)

14:59.431 --> 15:01.132
(GASPS)

15:13.612 --> 15:16.014
Ezra! Stay back.

15:16.016 --> 15:17.682
Kanan?

15:17.684 --> 15:19.984
Sabine?

15:34.533 --> 15:36.868
Sabine! It's Ezra!

15:42.408 --> 15:46.778
You better not hurt him!
We cannot defeat the spirits
of the Nightsisters!

15:46.780 --> 15:50.682
Follow me.
I will show you how
to save your friends.

15:52.985 --> 15:56.988
Faster! We must reach
the cave entrance.

16:12.471 --> 16:15.340
Wait. Why aren't they
coming after us?

16:15.342 --> 16:18.943
The altar is the source
of their power.

16:18.945 --> 16:21.813
They cannot venture
beyond the cave.

16:21.815 --> 16:25.083
It is unfortunate
about your friends, Ezra.

16:25.085 --> 16:28.586
But this...
This is your opportunity

16:28.588 --> 16:31.656
to embrace your destiny,

16:31.658 --> 16:33.758
as my apprentice.

16:33.760 --> 16:36.661
I told you, that is
never going to happen!

16:36.663 --> 16:38.796
Forget the past!

16:38.798 --> 16:41.532
Forget your memories!

16:41.534 --> 16:44.102
Forget your attachments.

16:44.104 --> 16:48.172
Our futures converge
on a planet with two suns.

16:48.174 --> 16:51.142
We can walk that path together

16:51.144 --> 16:55.146
as friends, as brothers.

16:55.148 --> 16:58.016
My friends are trapped
in there because of us.

16:58.018 --> 17:00.351
I can't just leave them.

17:01.520 --> 17:05.356
You disappoint me,

17:06.291 --> 17:08.659
Ezra Bridger.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.928
(LAUGHING)

17:17.002 --> 17:19.704
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

17:24.810 --> 17:28.079
Okay. The altar is where
their power comes from.

17:28.081 --> 17:29.814
So, they can't
leave the cave,

17:29.816 --> 17:32.984
which means I just have to
get Kanan and Sabine outside.

17:32.986 --> 17:35.219
How hard can that be?

17:35.221 --> 17:37.088
(QUIET CHITTERING)

17:39.525 --> 17:43.494
(SINISTER VOICE)
You're unwise
to reenter our sanctum.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.001
That doesn't
belong to you.

17:50.003 --> 17:53.304
Then take it from me, Jedi!

18:10.689 --> 18:15.293
(SHRIEKING)
No! No! No!

18:15.295 --> 18:17.695
You cannot destroy us!

18:17.697 --> 18:20.098
You'll never
save your friends!

18:20.100 --> 18:21.866
(LAUGHING)

18:21.868 --> 18:23.734
(COUGHING) Ezra?

18:23.736 --> 18:26.704
Whatever you got out of Maul,
I hope it was worth it.

18:26.706 --> 18:30.208
Do not go back in there.
They'll possess you again.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.710
What... What about you?

18:32.712 --> 18:34.612
Won't they possess you, too?

18:34.614 --> 18:36.047
I'm counting on it!

18:40.652 --> 18:42.320
Kanan?

18:45.157 --> 18:48.559
(SINISTER VOICE)
Maul promised us
flesh and blood.

18:48.561 --> 18:55.099
With it, we can begin again
and rebuild the great clan
of the Nightsisters.

18:55.101 --> 18:58.636
If Maul made you that promise,
then it's my debt as well.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.839
I will pay it.
Just let my friend go.

19:01.841 --> 19:06.811
Perhaps, if you prove
to be stronger.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.651
I know you're in there!

19:13.653 --> 19:16.854
I'm not losing you
to these monsters!

19:16.856 --> 19:20.324
Our due must be paid!

19:26.498 --> 19:29.934
Spirit,
I am the one you want!
Let him go!

19:40.345 --> 19:41.646
(COUGHING)

19:41.648 --> 19:43.648
Ezra!

19:43.650 --> 19:46.684
You belong to us, boy!

19:48.487 --> 19:50.888
Kanan, get out of here!

19:50.890 --> 19:53.958
You belong to us, boy.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.327
The debt must be paid.

19:56.329 --> 19:57.862
Now you will pay the price!

19:57.864 --> 19:59.764
I'm gonna have to
owe you one.

20:01.867 --> 20:03.868
No!

20:06.805 --> 20:09.774
(SHRIEKING)

20:21.420 --> 20:23.521
Kanan? I'm here.

20:23.523 --> 20:26.224
This is the last time
we're working with Maul.

20:26.226 --> 20:27.725
I sure hope so.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.528
Sabine, I told you
to stay outside.

20:30.530 --> 20:33.664
Hey, I've never
listened to you before.
Why start now?

20:34.600 --> 20:36.434
Well, was it worth it?

20:36.436 --> 20:38.869
Did you find out
what you wanted to know?

20:38.871 --> 20:40.404
Yes.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.873
The answer to my question
of how to destroy the Sith

20:42.875 --> 20:44.742
is Obi-Wan Kenobi.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.444
You think he's still alive?

20:46.446 --> 20:50.681
He must be. But, Kanan,
Maul's also looking for him.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.516
So he knows
where he is now?

20:52.518 --> 20:54.585
The holocron
didn't tell us that.

20:54.587 --> 20:57.021
It just told us
a planet with two suns.

20:57.023 --> 20:59.123
Well, that hardly
narrows it down.

20:59.125 --> 21:01.025
Well, we're gonna
have to figure it out,

21:01.027 --> 21:03.261
because if we don't find
Master Kenobi before Maul...

21:03.263 --> 21:05.162
There won't be any way
to stop the Sith.
