WEBVTT

00:08.541 --> 00:11.578
Ow! All right!
All right, I'll talk!

00:11.578 --> 00:14.080
Just make
the pain stop!

00:14.080 --> 00:15.081
Oh, shut up.

00:15.081 --> 00:16.583
I'm just trying to get the blood flowing.

00:16.583 --> 00:17.584
More like make me
hemorrhage.

00:18.084 --> 00:18.585
Don't tempt me.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.021
Oh, God, you broke something!

00:21.421 --> 00:23.490
Too bad it wasn't your bloody pie hole.

00:23.490 --> 00:25.458
There, we're done, you big baby.

00:25.859 --> 00:28.928
What? Already?

00:28.928 --> 00:31.431
Oh, that felt great. Oh!

00:31.431 --> 00:34.367
I feel like a new man.

00:34.367 --> 00:35.435
I love your new table.

00:35.435 --> 00:36.436
Oh, you're sweet.

00:36.436 --> 00:37.437
Can I make you
a sandwich?

00:37.437 --> 00:38.405
Oh, that'd be great.
Yeah.

00:38.938 --> 00:39.939
Oh, by the way, Daph,

00:39.939 --> 00:42.442
you know, they're showing the first ever episode

00:42.442 --> 00:43.443
of Rockford today.

00:43.443 --> 00:44.944
If you're really serious

00:44.944 --> 00:45.945
about becoming
an American citizen

00:45.945 --> 00:47.447
maybe you ought
to watch it.

00:47.447 --> 00:48.381
Ah...

00:48.748 --> 00:51.284
Well, now you've opened it.
That's mail theft.

00:51.284 --> 00:52.285
Nonsense.

00:52.719 --> 00:53.753
What's going on?
FRASIER:
Nothing.

00:54.120 --> 00:55.155
Just another piece
of Cam Winston's mail

00:55.155 --> 00:56.689
has found its way
into our box.

00:56.689 --> 00:58.124
It's been happening a lot since
we switched mailboxes.

00:58.458 --> 01:00.827
Even after I gave
the postman a stern lecture.

01:01.027 --> 01:03.029
Especially after.

01:04.763 --> 01:06.232
FRASIER:
Anyway, it was
an honest mistake.

01:06.566 --> 01:08.635
Cam and I are on
all the same mailing lists

01:08.635 --> 01:10.136
and I'm sure mine is
in his box.

01:10.136 --> 01:11.638
Besides,
it's nothing personal.

01:11.638 --> 01:13.139
Look, it's just
an announcement

01:13.640 --> 01:15.408
for some place
called La Porte D'Argent.

01:15.608 --> 01:17.677
Probably just another
froufrou restaurant

01:17.677 --> 01:19.145
or froufrou clothing store.

01:19.579 --> 01:21.648
No, no, no.
This is not froufrou, Dad,

01:22.148 --> 01:24.651
as evidenced
by the manly scent of balsam.

01:24.651 --> 01:27.153
They obviously deal with a very upscale clientele.

01:27.153 --> 01:28.154
Hmm.

01:28.154 --> 01:30.156
Oh! La Porte D'Argent.

01:30.156 --> 01:33.159
Someone at the racquet club
was talking about this.

01:33.159 --> 01:34.661
It's very, very exclusive.

01:35.161 --> 01:35.662
Yes?

01:36.096 --> 01:37.063
That's all I know.

01:39.432 --> 01:41.501
Some ill-mannered person
started up his blow dryer

01:41.501 --> 01:42.869
before I could hear any more.

01:43.169 --> 01:43.736
Hello.

01:44.237 --> 01:45.238
NILES:
Oh, Daphne, Daphne,

01:45.238 --> 01:46.773
did I get one of these
in the mail today?

01:47.173 --> 01:48.108
No, I don't think so.

01:48.408 --> 01:50.777
Poor Niles

01:51.010 --> 01:52.078
What's this about?

01:52.078 --> 01:54.581
Oh, they're all worked up
over some smelly invitation

01:54.581 --> 01:57.083
Frasier stole to some place
they never heard of.

01:57.083 --> 01:58.251
Oh.

01:58.251 --> 02:00.320
Yes, but that's what's
so intriguing, Dad.

02:00.320 --> 02:01.821
That there exists
an exclusive place in Seattle

02:02.322 --> 02:03.089
that neither of us knows about.

02:03.089 --> 02:06.259
Could be an art gallery

02:06.259 --> 02:08.161
or-or a new haberdashery.

02:08.161 --> 02:11.831
Or an Italian shoelace boutique.

02:12.031 --> 02:13.099
What's happening?

02:13.099 --> 02:14.367
It's a machine.
Oh.

02:14.367 --> 02:16.936
It's asking me to enter my six-digit access code.

02:17.437 --> 02:18.471
What'll I do?

02:18.471 --> 02:21.040
Why don't you just punch in
whatever keys spell out

02:21.040 --> 02:23.309
"snobby."

02:25.612 --> 02:27.580
You know, it might
be worth a try.

02:30.884 --> 02:32.318
Oh! Denied!

02:32.685 --> 02:35.255
Oh! The allure
of La Porte D'Argent

02:35.255 --> 02:37.257
has increased tenfold.

02:37.257 --> 02:38.725
All right,
here's our plan:

02:39.125 --> 02:41.194
We'll go to
the university computer lab,

02:41.194 --> 02:42.195
bribe some hungry hacker

02:42.695 --> 02:44.697
and once he's tapped into their mainframe

02:44.697 --> 02:46.699
La Porte D'Argent will offer up

02:46.699 --> 02:50.537
her sweet secret
like a blushing bride on her wedding night.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.872
Why don't you just
go down there

02:52.872 --> 02:54.774
and ask them
what they do?

02:57.377 --> 02:59.946
"B."
All right, Dad.
That's a plan

03:01.000 --> 03:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:16.896 --> 03:17.463
Hello.

03:17.964 --> 03:20.466
Uh, is this La Porte D'Argent?

03:20.466 --> 03:21.467
Yes, it is.

03:21.467 --> 03:22.802
Ah, good.

03:23.136 --> 03:25.138
Say, someone was asking me
earlier today

03:25.638 --> 03:27.140
about La Porte D'Argent

03:27.140 --> 03:31.177
and I had a-a difficult time
characterizing it.

03:31.177 --> 03:33.513
Uh, what would you tell him?

03:33.746 --> 03:36.149
We try to discourage
word of mouth.

03:36.416 --> 03:38.484
That's exactly what I said

03:38.918 --> 03:41.988
So, oh, well,
I'm here to take
advantage of your offer.

03:41.988 --> 03:43.990
Sure. Can I have
your name, please?

03:43.990 --> 03:44.991
Yes.
Frasier Crane

03:44.991 --> 03:47.994
(keyboard keys clacking)

03:47.994 --> 03:49.495
I'm not finding you.

03:49.495 --> 03:51.998
Try Dr. Frasier Crane

03:52.999 --> 03:55.835
Perhaps you've heard
my popular radio show.

03:56.135 --> 03:58.605
I'm not really a radio person.

04:01.107 --> 04:02.175
I'm sorry,

04:02.175 --> 04:03.676
You're not on the list.

04:03.676 --> 04:04.544
I can't let you in.

04:04.844 --> 04:06.379
But I have an invitation.

04:06.779 --> 04:07.680
Yes, but you're not on the list.

04:08.114 --> 04:09.682
Yes, but I do have an invitation.

04:09.682 --> 04:10.683
But you aren't
on the list.

04:11.117 --> 04:12.151
Yes, well,
if I were on the list

04:12.151 --> 04:13.686
then I wouldn't need
an invitation, would I?

04:14.187 --> 04:15.188
I would just say,
"I'm on the list."

04:15.188 --> 04:17.023
Therefore, the invitation
supersedes the list.

04:17.423 --> 04:20.260
No, invitations are given out
only to those on the list.

04:20.459 --> 04:21.527
Aha. But you
do concede

04:21.527 --> 04:23.363
that I have a
valid invitation?

04:23.663 --> 04:25.031
Yes.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.699
Then it naturally follows
that I would be on the list.

04:27.133 --> 04:28.501
But you're not.

04:28.701 --> 04:30.770
Then how did I get
the invitation?

04:31.204 --> 04:33.039
I really don't know.
You could have stolen it.

04:35.341 --> 04:37.343
Are you accusing me
of deception?

04:37.343 --> 04:38.678
Cam! Cam Winston!

04:38.978 --> 04:40.513
(chuckling):
There you are.

04:40.880 --> 04:44.784
(deep voice):
Hello, Frasier

04:45.151 --> 04:46.719
FRASIER: You know, while
I was waiting for you

04:47.153 --> 04:49.222
I decided to test
the mettle of this young man.

04:49.222 --> 04:51.224
I'm pleased to report
that he follows the rules

04:51.224 --> 04:52.725
of La Porte D'Argent
to the letter.

04:52.725 --> 04:55.495
(both laugh)

04:55.728 --> 04:56.696
Anyway

04:57.030 --> 04:58.564
I am a guest
of Mr. Cam Winston's here.

04:58.564 --> 05:00.066
Uh, he told me
to meet him here.

05:00.066 --> 05:02.101
Gave me the invitation,
and here I am.

05:02.101 --> 05:03.603
Yes, I'm Cam Winston, and he's my guest

05:03.603 --> 05:05.071
and I asked him
to meet me here.

05:05.505 --> 05:07.073
Oh!

05:08.574 --> 05:10.410
Here you are, Mr. Winston.

05:10.710 --> 05:12.645
Welcome to La Porte D'Argent.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.847
Ah, thank you.
I hope you both enjoy
your stay.

05:15.081 --> 05:16.649
Take a moment
to look over our services

05:16.649 --> 05:18.651
and I'll be back
in just a moment.

05:22.488 --> 05:26.492
Niles, it's a day spa!

05:26.492 --> 05:29.996
(deep voice):
Good gravy,
this is fantastic.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.932
Would you stop
talking like that?

05:33.266 --> 05:34.767
It's the worst impersonation of Cam Winston

05:34.767 --> 05:35.835
I've ever heard.

05:35.835 --> 05:36.836
You've heard another one?

05:37.270 --> 05:38.104
Of course not.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.239
Then it's the best.

05:40.506 --> 05:43.476
Now you're stuck
talking like that all day.

05:43.776 --> 05:44.844
Here are your keys, gentlemen.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.846
Your aestheticians
will be with you shortly.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.348
 you.
(clears throat)
Thank you.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.349
(normal voice):
Thank you.

05:49.849 --> 05:50.817
Oh, good, I've been waiting for that all morning.

05:56.089 --> 05:57.924
Oh, Niles...

05:57.924 --> 06:00.226
the air vetting massage
sounds splendid.

06:00.226 --> 06:02.161
"Two therapists at once

06:02.161 --> 06:03.496
using hot stones"

06:03.496 --> 06:06.332
"and a blend of essential oils

06:06.833 --> 06:10.169
personally created
for your dosha."

06:12.038 --> 06:13.473
I think I'll have
the aroma therapy Swedish.

06:13.473 --> 06:14.540
Oh, Niles.

06:14.540 --> 06:17.009
Look at this bounty.

06:17.510 --> 06:20.546
Take a risk. Be a man.

06:21.047 --> 06:23.850
The "Chardonnay Rose Hips
Salt Glow"?

06:24.083 --> 06:25.551
Now, that's more like it

06:27.820 --> 06:29.822
Oh, lovely

06:30.356 --> 06:31.324
Right this way.

06:31.324 --> 06:32.792
Thank you.
Frasier, Frasier,

06:33.126 --> 06:36.162
river rocks and a stalk of
wheat. Ooh.

06:36.162 --> 06:37.163
Ooh.

06:42.201 --> 06:44.704
(water burbling,
new age music playing)

06:44.704 --> 06:46.706
I knew it was going
to be good,

06:46.706 --> 06:49.509
but I had no idea
it would be this good.

06:49.742 --> 06:52.812
I feel like I've been
rubbed by angels.

06:52.812 --> 06:54.313
Niles, I just wish you had tried

06:54.313 --> 06:56.315
the vasotocin aqua therapy treatment.

06:56.816 --> 06:59.318
I feel as if I've had
a rebirthing experience.

06:59.318 --> 07:01.087
I've never felt better in my life.

07:01.087 --> 07:05.358
I'm so polished,
my entire body is squeaking.

07:05.358 --> 07:06.359
(laughs)

07:06.359 --> 07:07.360
Ah, hello.

07:07.360 --> 07:08.361
How was everything?

07:08.861 --> 07:09.362
Oh...
Heaven.

07:09.862 --> 07:10.696
Nirvana.

07:10.696 --> 07:12.031
I'm so glad.

07:12.031 --> 07:14.333
Now this is a breakdown of your services.

07:14.333 --> 07:15.201
Ah.

07:15.201 --> 07:16.702
(coughs)

07:16.702 --> 07:18.704
Oh.

07:18.704 --> 07:20.206
Nirvana ain't cheap.

07:20.206 --> 07:21.507
Well...

07:21.774 --> 07:24.610
Well, it's worth it,
I suppose.

07:24.610 --> 07:25.878
What do you say we make this

07:25.878 --> 07:26.879
a standing
appointment, Niles?

07:27.380 --> 07:28.314
I think we owe it
to ourselves.
Yes.

07:28.314 --> 07:29.782
I'd be happy
to set that up

07:29.782 --> 07:31.217
Ah!
Now, I've also put together

07:31.217 --> 07:33.586
a personal La Porte D'Argent product system

07:33.586 --> 07:35.388
for each of you

07:35.388 --> 07:38.391
based on the
recommendations of your aestheticians.

07:38.391 --> 07:40.893
Oh, Niles,
this smells great.

07:41.394 --> 07:42.895
Try that.

07:42.895 --> 07:45.398
The mid-afternoon,
antistress spritz.

07:45.398 --> 07:46.899
Mm-hmm.

07:48.901 --> 07:51.404
I've never even heard
of "eyelash conditioner."

07:51.404 --> 07:52.405
Ah.

07:53.906 --> 07:55.908
Hence the brittle lashes.

07:58.911 --> 08:02.348
Hey, isn't that
Senator Ogden?

08:02.715 --> 08:04.283
It is.

08:04.283 --> 08:07.086
Oh, Niles, this just gets
better and better.

08:07.587 --> 08:09.088
Balanced skin
and social advancement

08:09.088 --> 08:10.890
all in one setting.
I'm going to go say hello.

08:13.893 --> 08:15.361
I'm sorry.

08:15.761 --> 08:18.798
That area is restricted
to our Gold Level members.

08:21.367 --> 08:22.435
You have a gold level?

08:22.935 --> 08:23.803
How do you get in?

08:24.103 --> 08:26.005
You'd have to
be on the list.

08:26.272 --> 08:27.640
But we are on the list.

08:27.874 --> 08:29.809
The Gold List.

08:30.076 --> 08:31.143
FRASIER:
This is absurd!

08:31.544 --> 08:33.613
I'm a member of every exclusive club
in this entire town.

08:33.613 --> 08:36.115
You must have a reciprocal
membership with one of them.

08:36.115 --> 08:37.450
I'm sorry.

08:37.717 --> 08:40.285
But you're more than welcome
to enjoy the many amenities

08:40.285 --> 08:42.054
of the Silver Level.

08:44.323 --> 08:47.226
And just how are we
supposed to enjoy this?!

08:50.630 --> 08:52.632
And this isn't working!

08:59.338 --> 09:03.409
(gunfire)

09:03.409 --> 09:05.311
Well, technically,
he's not Maverick in this-- he's Rockford.

09:05.645 --> 09:08.648
Even though we all know
he's secretly Maverick.

09:09.015 --> 09:10.583
I can see why
you like this show.

09:10.583 --> 09:11.584
Yeah.

09:12.018 --> 09:13.085
What's not to like?

09:13.085 --> 09:16.556
Solving crimes,
pretty girls, car chases.

09:16.989 --> 09:17.890
Leisure suits.

09:18.124 --> 09:19.625
Yeah!

09:22.028 --> 09:24.497
Rockford's dad
reminds me of you.

09:24.864 --> 09:26.432
What are you talking about?

09:26.832 --> 09:27.900
Rockford's dad.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.736
You're just like him:
cranky but lovable.

09:31.037 --> 09:32.104
The hell I am.

09:32.104 --> 09:34.006
I'm like Rockford.

09:34.307 --> 09:35.241
How do you get that?

09:35.508 --> 09:36.576
Well, come on.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.077
He solves crimes,
I solved crimes.

09:38.077 --> 09:40.580
We're both in tune
with the beat of the street.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.582
He's the kind of guy
that men want to be

09:43.082 --> 09:44.083
and women want to be with.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.085
When this show first came out,

09:46.085 --> 09:48.087
everybody used to say
I was like Rockford.

09:51.490 --> 09:53.059
I'm sorry, I don't see it.

09:53.059 --> 09:55.027
You still remind me of his dad.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.997
Rocky? But he's old.

10:01.500 --> 10:02.868
Oh, I see.

10:03.202 --> 10:05.271
I didn't mean that.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.740
I just meant
there's something about him

10:07.740 --> 10:08.708
that reminds me of you.

10:09.041 --> 10:10.610
Yeah, his oldness?

10:10.610 --> 10:11.911
Oh, stop it.

10:11.911 --> 10:14.480
If you want to be Rockford,
you can be Rockford.

10:14.480 --> 10:15.414
I don't care.
Fine.

10:15.781 --> 10:18.217
Then let's just watch it.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.924
I don't want to
watch this anymore

10:24.924 --> 10:29.261
Congratulations-- you've ruined Rockford for me.

10:29.562 --> 10:31.631
I had a nagging feeling
the whole time

10:31.631 --> 10:34.567
they were holding something back
on purpose.

10:34.900 --> 10:38.471
"Blended for your dosha,"
indeed!

10:38.471 --> 10:42.274
They wouldn't know my dosha
if they fell over it!

10:42.541 --> 10:45.044
So what kind of a hoity-toity
place did it end up being?

10:45.044 --> 10:46.979
It was a hellhole!

10:46.979 --> 10:49.482
They have the nerve
to call it a day spa

10:49.482 --> 10:51.984
when it's nothing more
than a-a mere front

10:51.984 --> 10:53.486
for a bona fide luxury spa

10:53.986 --> 10:56.989
which taunts those kept at bay
outside its golden door.

10:56.989 --> 10:58.991
If you didn't go in,
how do you know it's better?

10:58.991 --> 10:59.992
FRASIER:
It had to be.

10:59.992 --> 11:01.494
The door was gold.

11:01.494 --> 11:02.995
Ours was only silver.

11:02.995 --> 11:05.431
Gold is better than silver.

11:05.431 --> 11:08.668
Stupid silver.

11:08.668 --> 11:12.471
Well, you'll always be
in my exclusive club, honey.

11:12.471 --> 11:13.839
Oh, thanks.

11:13.839 --> 11:15.875
And that's all I need.

11:15.875 --> 11:18.844
There must be somebody
who can get us in.

11:18.844 --> 11:20.846
Let's go comb our Rolodexes.

11:20.846 --> 11:22.181
Yes.

11:22.181 --> 11:23.516
There has to be a way

11:23.516 --> 11:26.018
out of the slum
they call the Silver Room.

11:26.519 --> 11:30.056
Why do I keep squeaking?!

11:31.557 --> 11:32.491
Hey, Frasier.

11:32.491 --> 11:33.559
Oh.

11:33.559 --> 11:35.061
Wait till you see this.

11:35.061 --> 11:36.529
(laughing):
It is so cool.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.530
Really?

11:38.030 --> 11:40.066
Well, I could use something to balm my wounds.

11:40.066 --> 11:40.966
(chuckles)

11:41.300 --> 11:42.835
Painful as it is,
I've come to accept

11:43.369 --> 11:46.205
that I shall never pass
through that spa's gold door

11:46.205 --> 11:48.040
Anyway, I was filing
your new head shot...

11:48.541 --> 11:49.542
Yes, mm-hmm?

11:49.542 --> 11:51.043
...and I started looking
through your old ones.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.045
Went back to when
you first started.

11:53.045 --> 11:54.547
Mm-hmm

11:54.547 --> 11:56.549
(chuckling)

11:58.551 --> 12:00.486
(continues chuckling)

12:00.486 --> 12:02.388
Whoo!

12:02.388 --> 12:04.223
What am I lookingat?

12:04.457 --> 12:07.393
Oh, it's like an animation
of your hairline receding.

12:07.693 --> 12:08.728
Isn't that great?

12:08.728 --> 12:10.262
(laughing)

12:10.262 --> 12:12.231
Okay, right now,
here's the good part.

12:12.231 --> 12:13.566
Uh-huh.

12:13.833 --> 12:15.301
It's growing back!
Ha.

12:15.668 --> 12:16.235
Receding.

12:16.736 --> 12:17.737
Yes, yes.

12:17.737 --> 12:18.738
s.
Growing back.
Yes, yes, ye

12:18.738 --> 12:20.740
All right, Roz, that's enough, all right!

12:20.740 --> 12:21.741
Don't be so sensitive.
(groans)

12:21.741 --> 12:22.742
Hi.
Hi.

12:23.175 --> 12:24.076
Oh, Niles, no good news,

12:24.343 --> 12:24.910
I suppose?

12:25.411 --> 12:26.345
I've had no luck
getting us

12:26.679 --> 12:28.114
into the gold level.

12:28.414 --> 12:29.482
Are you guys really
this bent out of shape

12:29.982 --> 12:30.449
about that gold spa?

12:30.883 --> 12:31.951
Yes.

12:31.951 --> 12:33.753
Why can't you be happy
with the silver one?

12:34.019 --> 12:34.920
'Cause gold is better.

12:35.154 --> 12:37.223
Bull. The only reason
why you want to go there

12:37.223 --> 12:38.524
is because you can't.

12:38.724 --> 12:41.193
We saw a senator
going in.

12:41.527 --> 12:42.595
Asenator.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.597
We elected him--
he works for us.

12:45.097 --> 12:48.100
How is it fair
that our employee is admitted

12:48.100 --> 12:52.104
while we are shunted off to
the icy depths of silver level?

12:54.573 --> 12:56.575
It's a spa.

12:56.575 --> 12:58.511
How much better could it be?

12:58.511 --> 13:01.413
What, are they going to carry
you around like a sultan?

13:01.413 --> 13:03.415
You going to be massaged
by supermodels?

13:03.415 --> 13:05.918
And then, what if you do
get through the gold door?

13:05.918 --> 13:07.286
What next, the diamond door?

13:07.620 --> 13:09.121
And after that,
a titanium door.

13:09.688 --> 13:11.690
And after that, a plutonium door.

13:11.690 --> 13:12.625
That's ridiculous.

13:13.058 --> 13:14.126
Plutonium's radioactive.

13:14.126 --> 13:17.129
No one's going to make a door out of it.

13:19.932 --> 13:21.934
Although Roz does make
a point, Niles.

13:21.934 --> 13:24.303
What kind of crazy fantasy
are we chasing?

13:26.272 --> 13:27.673
(sighs)

13:27.973 --> 13:29.542
See? I'm right.
Hmm?

13:30.042 --> 13:31.510
sorry.
Oh, I'm-I'm

13:31.944 --> 13:35.414
I was just imagining supermodels
with that crook Senator Ogden.

13:35.781 --> 13:37.349
It was Senator Ogden?

13:37.349 --> 13:39.151
I know him.

13:39.552 --> 13:40.986
You do?

13:41.253 --> 13:42.588
ROZ:
Yeah.

13:42.788 --> 13:43.823
He really owes me one, too.

13:44.356 --> 13:45.324
Want me to give him a call?

13:45.324 --> 13:46.859
Would you?
Absolutely!

13:47.359 --> 13:48.694
How do you know
Senator Ogden?

13:48.694 --> 13:51.030
Well... I knew him
a few years ago

13:51.030 --> 13:53.032
when his marriage
was on the rocks.

13:53.532 --> 13:54.967
We kept it very hush-hush.

13:54.967 --> 13:58.904
Thank God I knew CPR.

14:01.874 --> 14:03.409
Rockford is on.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.245
Not interested.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.581
Oh, come on,
it looks like a good one.

14:08.581 --> 14:09.582
Tom Selleck's in it.

14:10.082 --> 14:11.550
Oh, those are good.

14:11.984 --> 14:14.820
Not that I care.

14:15.020 --> 14:18.090
You know, I caught
a few episodes at home,

14:18.090 --> 14:20.559
and I see the resemblance
between you

14:20.960 --> 14:24.530
and a young Jim Rockford.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.498
No, you don't.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.767
Yes, I do.

14:29.001 --> 14:31.537
No one gives him credit
when he has a good idea.

14:31.937 --> 14:33.873
He likes to drive
a little too fast.

14:34.206 --> 14:35.140
He's got my chin.

14:36.809 --> 14:37.877
And he knows
how to work the system,

14:37.877 --> 14:38.811
and the babes love him.

14:39.178 --> 14:40.679
Yes, they do.

14:41.013 --> 14:42.081
(chuckling)

14:42.481 --> 14:43.916
So what do you say?

14:44.216 --> 14:47.286
t?
Oh, okay, why no

14:50.789 --> 14:53.225
od.
Ah, this is go

14:53.225 --> 14:56.695
Sorry I got so worked up.

14:56.695 --> 14:59.632
You've got principles,
like Rockford.

14:59.632 --> 15:02.902
Okay, let's not lay it on too thick.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.004
Oh, look at that.

15:05.004 --> 15:06.805
Malibu, California

15:06.805 --> 15:09.308
FYI, those mountains you
see in the background

15:09.308 --> 15:11.810
are the same ones you
see at the beginning of MASH.

15:11.810 --> 15:14.280
Oh, I love MASH.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.749
Whenever I watch it,
I think of you

15:17.249 --> 15:19.752
serving in Korea
all those years ago.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.587
Just like Colonel Potter.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.859
That's it. Go home.

15:26.859 --> 15:28.127
Why?

15:28.394 --> 15:31.430
Colonel Potter was old
when he did Dragnet!

15:31.830 --> 15:34.900
Colonel Potter--
that funny young doctor

15:34.900 --> 15:38.203
who used to mix martinis
in his tent.

15:38.404 --> 15:39.972
Oh, you're thinking of Hawkeye

15:40.406 --> 15:41.974
Yes, that's who I meant.

15:45.978 --> 15:49.848
Okay.

15:58.757 --> 16:00.759
(birds chirping)

16:01.260 --> 16:04.196
I've taken you to
the relaxation grotto.

16:04.196 --> 16:05.664
We'll just let the wrap

16:05.664 --> 16:08.167
and your orange-honey butter mask soothe you

16:08.167 --> 16:10.669
while you listen to the healing sounds

16:10.669 --> 16:12.504
of the Javanese
rain forest, okay?

16:12.738 --> 16:14.336
(squeaky voice):
Okay.

16:25.317 --> 16:26.652
Oh, excuse me.

16:29.521 --> 16:30.789
Frasier?
Hm?

16:30.990 --> 16:32.024
Frasier, is that you?

16:32.024 --> 16:33.325
Niles.
Hi.

16:33.592 --> 16:35.661
I just had a...
a color therapy treatment.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.663
My eyes haven't readjusted yet

16:38.163 --> 16:39.932
Uh, they sent me
in here to relax.

16:40.165 --> 16:42.735
I'm letting
my orange-honey butter mask set.

16:42.735 --> 16:43.669
Oh.

16:44.069 --> 16:45.637
(sighs)

16:45.637 --> 16:48.640
Roz was so wrong

16:49.141 --> 16:50.976
(sighs):
  Ah.

16:50.976 --> 16:52.311
Completely wrong.

16:52.311 --> 16:54.313
(chuckling)

16:54.313 --> 16:56.815
Oh. Yeah, my eyes are better.

16:56.815 --> 16:58.317
Hmm.

16:58.317 --> 17:00.819
Oh, Niles.

17:01.320 --> 17:03.188
You should see this place.

17:03.188 --> 17:05.523
Be my eyes, Frasier.

17:10.329 --> 17:13.332
Well... it's just paradise

17:13.832 --> 17:15.334
(chuckles)

17:15.334 --> 17:17.336
From the rare, exotic orchids...

17:17.836 --> 17:19.838
the trompe l'oeil sky...

17:20.339 --> 17:24.843
the perfectly bubbled stream
to the...

17:26.811 --> 17:28.247
To the what?

17:30.849 --> 17:33.852
There's a platinum door.

17:33.852 --> 17:37.856
Platinum?

17:38.357 --> 17:39.324
Are you sure?

17:39.324 --> 17:40.759
Yes.

17:40.759 --> 17:41.760
Is it guarded?

17:41.760 --> 17:44.696
No! Just brazenly
standing there.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.099
Then rip the cucumbers
from my eyes, and let's go!

17:47.099 --> 17:48.567
Right.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.135
(grunting)

17:50.135 --> 17:51.136
Niles!

17:51.637 --> 17:52.638
What?

17:52.638 --> 17:54.106
What are we doing?
Oh!

17:54.106 --> 17:56.041
This is exactly what Roz said.

17:56.041 --> 17:58.477
No, no. Roz said
"diamond door."

17:58.477 --> 18:00.479
Niles, this is heaven.

18:00.979 --> 18:02.281
Right here and now

18:02.281 --> 18:04.083
Why do we have to think about someplace else?

18:04.083 --> 18:05.584
This is only heaven

18:05.584 --> 18:07.586
for the people who can't get
into the real heaven--

18:07.586 --> 18:09.088
the platinum heaven.

18:09.588 --> 18:11.090
Niles, why can'’t we be happy?

18:11.090 --> 18:13.592
Why must we allow the-
the thought of something

18:13.592 --> 18:16.595
that at this point can only be incrementally better,

18:16.595 --> 18:17.930
ruin what is here and now?

18:17.930 --> 18:19.264
(gasping):
I don't know.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.600
Let's figure it out...
on the other side.

18:25.604 --> 18:26.538
No.

18:26.538 --> 18:28.440
I am through chasing
the eternal carrot.

18:29.007 --> 18:29.975
Whatever is behind that door

18:30.442 --> 18:32.277
shall remain behind that door
unseen.

18:32.544 --> 18:34.613
Stay if you want.

18:34.613 --> 18:37.616
I have to know!

18:39.618 --> 18:43.122
Oh, for God's sake,
you can't even walk, you ninny!

18:43.122 --> 18:45.124
All right, all right,
I will go.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.125
Just to take a peek.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.493
MAN:
I'm sorry, sir.

18:47.493 --> 18:49.294
You're not allowed
through there.

18:49.294 --> 18:51.263
Please remain
in the relaxation grotto.

18:56.668 --> 18:59.171
"Please remain...

18:59.171 --> 19:02.608
in the relaxation grotto"?

19:04.343 --> 19:07.980
Have crueler words
ever been spoken?

19:08.313 --> 19:10.382
Now, that's it--
I am determined

19:10.382 --> 19:12.885
to see where they think
I don't belong.

19:13.318 --> 19:14.887
Take me with you!

19:25.464 --> 19:28.534
(gasps):
 Niles...

19:28.534 --> 19:31.036
