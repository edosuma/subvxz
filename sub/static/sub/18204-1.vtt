03:29.284 --> 03:30.410
Papers please, sir.

03:30.485 --> 03:33.113
You want to see my driving license?

03:35.590 --> 03:38.184
My friend won't be needing any.

03:38.259 --> 03:40.250
Papers in order, sir.

04:33.083 --> 04:37.520
What happened to Kaminsky, McDonald,
Akhmed, the two Maltese?

04:38.288 --> 04:41.553
I brought back the young officer,
as you told me.

04:43.927 --> 04:46.088
I left the others behind.

04:46.596 --> 04:49.087
And what went wrong this time?

04:49.166 --> 04:53.728
We got within 20 miles,
then I was spotted by a couple of snipers.

04:53.803 --> 04:56.795
And what happened
to Lieutenant Evans exactly?

04:59.609 --> 05:01.736
He was just unlucky.

05:01.811 --> 05:04.644
Get yourself cleaned up.
I want to talk to you.

05:04.714 --> 05:07.205
Brigadier Blore is waiting, sir.

05:15.359 --> 05:18.351
- You're not going to change, sir?
- Into what?

05:51.796 --> 05:53.787
Another one down the dilly.

05:53.864 --> 05:57.096
So far, Masters,
you have cost the British Army £42,000

05:57.169 --> 06:00.502
in what you call miscellaneous costs.

06:00.572 --> 06:03.439
Plus 17 jeeps, 24 trucks,

06:03.508 --> 06:05.669
a small fortune
in ammunition and supplies

06:05.744 --> 06:08.235
and the lives of three British officers.

06:08.313 --> 06:10.679
Forty-three of my men
have been killed also, sir.

06:10.749 --> 06:15.448
Your total requisition
for the past 12 months has been £124,563.

06:15.520 --> 06:16.544
Yes, sir.

06:16.622 --> 06:18.852
You've sent eight missions
behind the German lines,

06:18.924 --> 06:20.619
and you've achieved nothing.

06:20.692 --> 06:23.422
Colonel Masters, you are a luxury
we cannot afford.

06:23.495 --> 06:26.328
My work over the last 12 months

06:26.398 --> 06:28.457
has been a preparatory exploration

06:28.533 --> 06:31.024
into the techniques
which I intend to employ.

06:31.103 --> 06:33.970
The experience
of the great commanders of the past

06:34.039 --> 06:35.974
who have fought over
this very same territory

06:36.042 --> 06:38.101
will ultimately prove invaluable.

06:38.177 --> 06:39.735
Modern warfare
has nothing whatever to do

06:39.812 --> 06:42.804
with the activities
of Alexander the Great or Hannibal.

06:42.882 --> 06:45.373
The principles of desert warfare
have not changed.

06:45.451 --> 06:48.682
The principles of getting value
for your money haven't changed either.

06:48.755 --> 06:51.815
Masters, your outfit
is disbanded forthwith.

06:52.358 --> 06:56.488
Captain Attwood will go back with you,
and you will hand over to him.

06:56.562 --> 06:58.325
- You yourself will take a week's leave...
- Yes, sir.

06:58.398 --> 07:00.127
...to find yourself a suitable uniform.

07:00.199 --> 07:03.362
I know that you have to wear mufti,
but you might shave occasionally.

07:03.436 --> 07:04.528
Yes, indeed, sir.

07:04.604 --> 07:06.037
You will then take over command

07:06.105 --> 07:09.939
of the prisoner of war camp at Sidi Barrani
with effect from the 17th.

07:10.009 --> 07:13.809
I have located, through my contacts
with the Mujabra tribesmen,

07:13.880 --> 07:16.940
the perfect target for
my kind of operation.

07:22.089 --> 07:24.250
Where the hell
did you get this photograph?

07:24.325 --> 07:26.225
It appears the Mujabra tribesmen

07:26.293 --> 07:30.787
have learnt how to use
the Brownie cameras I supplied them with.

07:36.437 --> 07:39.804
This camp is about 400 miles
behind the enemy lines.

07:39.873 --> 07:44.037
Precisely. You can't get there, but I can.

07:44.111 --> 07:45.669
Two men are going to stop Rommel.

07:45.746 --> 07:47.976
One of them is Adolf Hitler,
who cannot give him enough fuel,

07:48.048 --> 07:51.848
the other is me,
who's going to blow up the little he has.

07:58.092 --> 08:00.152
Masters, I shall give you one more chance.

08:00.228 --> 08:01.252
Thank you, sir.

08:01.329 --> 08:03.661
This time you've got to succeed.

08:03.732 --> 08:07.190
I shall put the expedition
under the command of a British officer.

08:07.268 --> 08:09.099
But British officers
don't understand my method, sir.

08:09.170 --> 08:11.570
Do as I say, and this time I want him back.

08:11.639 --> 08:13.630
- Yes, sir.
- Alive.

08:13.708 --> 08:16.438
If I must have an officer, sir,
could he be someone

08:16.511 --> 08:20.470
who knows something about pipelines,
petrol installations, that sort of thing?

08:20.548 --> 08:22.379
- We'll see if we have someone to spare.
- Yes, sir.

08:22.450 --> 08:24.418
Don't forget, Masters,
this is your last chance.

08:24.486 --> 08:26.147
Thank you, sir.

08:26.755 --> 08:29.849
- I'll send them back to you.
- Yes, sir.

08:38.066 --> 08:41.058
- Ask Watkins to come in, would you?
- Yes, sir.

08:44.874 --> 08:47.399
Alan, I had an idea.

08:47.476 --> 08:50.104
Take a look at that and that.

08:51.013 --> 08:52.537
Interested?

08:52.982 --> 08:56.418
There must be millions of gallons in there
by the look of things.

08:56.485 --> 08:57.850
- Rommel's?
- Yes.

08:57.920 --> 09:00.787
There. About 400 miles behind their lines.

09:00.856 --> 09:04.519
I got the location pretty accurately
from some of my Mujabra tribesmen.

09:04.593 --> 09:06.584
Actually, they took
the photographs for me.

09:06.662 --> 09:09.688
- Like to go and blow it up?
- We'll give you a show, sir.

09:09.765 --> 09:11.630
Rommel is here.

09:11.700 --> 09:13.827
His lines of communication
are really extended,

09:13.903 --> 09:15.598
so we're going to hit him hard.

09:15.671 --> 09:17.969
Now, if you can destroy
the bulk of his fuel supplies

09:18.040 --> 09:19.871
at that moment,
it might make all the difference.

09:19.942 --> 09:21.000
We'll try, sir.

09:21.076 --> 09:23.910
Rommel's gonna be defeated
by two men, Watkins.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.244
Adolf Hitler,
who can't give him enough fuel,

09:26.316 --> 09:29.410
and me, because I'm gonna blow up
what little he has.

09:29.486 --> 09:32.250
By the way, I'm sending a decoy group
ahead of you.

09:32.322 --> 09:35.018
- You know Masters' bunch?
- Not those gangsters, sir.

09:35.091 --> 09:38.925
Yes, they set off a day before you.
Same route, same orders.

09:38.995 --> 09:41.725
If there's any trouble, let them catch it.

09:41.798 --> 09:43.459
Not particularly pleasant, sir.

09:43.533 --> 09:45.694
You leave in two days, Watkins.
Good luck.

09:45.769 --> 09:47.464
Thank you, sir.

09:50.974 --> 09:52.771
Well, that's that.

09:53.243 --> 09:55.871
What about the British officer
for Colonel Masters, sir?

09:55.946 --> 09:57.971
Oh, completely forgot.

09:58.415 --> 10:00.406
Tell them to find a spare captain
from somewhere.

10:00.484 --> 10:01.883
Yes, sir.

10:01.952 --> 10:05.013
Oh, yes, and I suppose he'd better
know something about petrol.

10:05.089 --> 10:06.488
Yes, sir.

10:12.964 --> 10:15.262
Where can I find Captain Douglas, Sarge?

10:15.333 --> 10:16.732
- Who?
- Captain Douglas.

10:16.801 --> 10:18.234
Up there.

10:38.189 --> 10:40.123
- Captain Douglas, sir?
- Yes.

10:40.191 --> 10:43.422
Colonel Homerton would like to see you
in his office, sir.

10:44.830 --> 10:47.025
Colonel Homerton said immediately, sir.

10:47.099 --> 10:50.694
Tell Colonel Homerton
I'll be there in an hour.

10:52.004 --> 10:54.700
I have to finish unloading the fuel.

10:55.374 --> 10:57.137
As you say, sir.

11:06.618 --> 11:08.984
- You're late.
- I know. What's up?

11:09.054 --> 11:11.249
I don't know, honestly.

11:14.326 --> 11:16.794
- It's not...
- No. No.

11:19.831 --> 11:21.389
Wish me luck.

11:30.510 --> 11:33.536
- You sent for me, sir?
- Yes.

11:35.848 --> 11:38.612
Captain Douglas is on loan
from British Petroleum.

11:38.685 --> 11:40.710
He's worked for seven years
as a field engineer

11:40.787 --> 11:43.187
with the Anglo-Iranian branch.

11:43.990 --> 11:47.391
- So, you know the desert?
- Yes.

11:48.928 --> 11:51.624
- A little.
- Excellent.

11:52.265 --> 11:55.757
Captain Attwood here
is from HQ, Special Forces.

11:55.835 --> 11:58.201
They want an officer
with some experience of fuel supplies

11:58.271 --> 12:01.240
to take command of a rather unusual unit.

12:01.307 --> 12:02.569
May I point out, sir,

12:02.642 --> 12:04.667
that the arrangement
with British Petroleum

12:04.744 --> 12:06.735
was that I stay in port areas.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.782
What are you wearing?

12:10.050 --> 12:11.483
British uniform, sir.

12:11.552 --> 12:13.747
British Petroleum uniform?

12:14.655 --> 12:15.952
No, sir.

12:16.023 --> 12:19.186
Good. Captain Attwood will give you
the Brigadier's orders.

12:19.259 --> 12:20.692
He's your man.

13:03.838 --> 13:05.567
This is it, sir.

13:11.579 --> 13:12.841
Are you sure?

13:12.914 --> 13:15.314
Yes, sir. Caf?'s over there.

13:34.003 --> 13:36.369
- Colonel Masters?
- No.

13:36.439 --> 13:41.138
- Oh, then I'll have a whiskey, please.
- No whiskey.

13:41.210 --> 13:44.111
- I'll have a beer then.
- No beer.

13:45.314 --> 13:46.713
What do you have?

13:47.950 --> 13:49.076
Tea.

13:49.151 --> 13:51.051
Then I'll have tea.

14:12.342 --> 14:14.537
Looking for Colonel Masters?

14:14.611 --> 14:16.169
Who are you?

14:16.680 --> 14:18.341
I'm Captain Leech.

14:18.982 --> 14:21.473
- British Army?
- No.

14:37.267 --> 14:38.757
Follow me.

14:52.716 --> 14:54.878
Some kind of a soldier to see you, Colonel.

14:54.952 --> 14:56.146
Yes.

15:03.027 --> 15:05.518
- Colonel Masters, sir?
- Yes.

15:06.631 --> 15:08.599
Captain Douglas, sir.

15:10.234 --> 15:12.759
Oh, my dear fellow,
there's no need for all that.

15:12.837 --> 15:14.771
My number two, Captain Leech.

15:14.839 --> 15:18.468
How do you do? Which regiment, Captain?

15:19.010 --> 15:21.205
Late of the Fourth Panzer.

15:22.413 --> 15:24.643
Do you know why you're here, Douglas?

15:24.715 --> 15:29.015
I understand I'm to command
one of your units on a special mission.

15:31.422 --> 15:33.219
Thank you, Leech.

15:34.458 --> 15:36.086
See you later.

15:41.733 --> 15:47.228
Now, let me explain
exactly what you're here for.

15:48.807 --> 15:52.334
Caprus Magna, a Roman port in Cyrenaica,

15:52.411 --> 15:55.346
that the Germans appear to be using
as a petrol dump.

15:55.414 --> 15:57.575
Are these Rommel's positions, sir?

15:57.649 --> 16:02.916
No, those are the positions
of the Carthaginians in the year 215 B.C.

16:03.422 --> 16:05.947
Desert warfare hasn't changed.

16:06.024 --> 16:10.961
Like the ancient Egyptians, I'm going
to send an expedition south to Qattara.

16:11.029 --> 16:15.693
Across the Qattara Depression,
through the cliffs of the Siwah Pass,

16:15.767 --> 16:20.102
over the great sand sea,
through the stony desert,

16:20.173 --> 16:22.607
and crash into Caprus Magna.

16:22.675 --> 16:25.303
And that's what you're here for.

16:26.779 --> 16:30.510
I am going to lead a unit down there,

16:30.583 --> 16:33.313
across there and up there.

16:33.887 --> 16:37.482
Exactly. I'll give you my best man.
He knows the ropes.

16:38.491 --> 16:41.619
- Captain Leech?
- A man of considerable experience.

17:30.144 --> 17:32.704
All right. Get back to work.

17:36.183 --> 17:38.674
- Have you signed your crew on yet?
- Yes.

17:38.752 --> 17:41.620
- How many are you taking?
- Oh, seven, that's enough.

17:41.690 --> 17:44.818
One more would get in the way.
Seven's my lucky number.

17:44.893 --> 17:48.488
Eight is what you've got,
and I believe I'm in command.

17:50.365 --> 17:52.492
Is our friend serious?

17:52.567 --> 17:55.502
I'm sure he will work
very closely with you, Leech.

17:55.570 --> 17:59.006
Naturally, I would be grateful
for any help I could get.

17:59.074 --> 18:03.272
I see. Well, I've got a better idea.
Keep it at seven.

18:03.345 --> 18:05.210
You go, I'll stay.

18:06.014 --> 18:07.948
Then everybody's happy.

18:08.917 --> 18:12.478
I've told Stores to kit you out.
I expect they're waiting for you.

18:12.554 --> 18:15.614
- We'll talk more at dinner.
- Very well, sir.

18:19.094 --> 18:22.929
Captain Leech, I want a full inspection
at 7:00 tomorrow morning.

18:22.999 --> 18:25.797
Everything laid out and ready to load.

18:27.336 --> 18:29.497
Anything else you'd like?

18:30.439 --> 18:32.566
No, I think that's all.

18:32.641 --> 18:34.802
I'll see you at dinner, sir.

18:40.583 --> 18:42.813
What's all this about?

18:42.885 --> 18:45.854
Brigadier Blore's not very pleased
with our record.

18:45.921 --> 18:48.583
He insists. We'll have to take him.

18:49.125 --> 18:50.717
I'll take him.

18:50.793 --> 18:54.285
If he doesn't come back alive,
we're out of business.

18:54.830 --> 18:56.457
You're out of business.

18:57.767 --> 19:00.600
You get well paid for these trips,
don't you, Leech?

19:00.669 --> 19:01.830
Not really.

19:01.905 --> 19:04.396
I'll give you a bonus if you get him back.

19:05.242 --> 19:07.506
- How much?
- Dead, nothing.

19:08.178 --> 19:10.646
Alive, £2,000.

19:14.017 --> 19:16.178
You just bought yourself an Englishman.

19:27.297 --> 19:29.197
Where did you find him?

19:29.633 --> 19:32.625
One of my recruiting drives
at Rabida prison.

19:33.070 --> 19:35.231
Tunisian named Sadok.

19:35.305 --> 19:38.331
He threw a bomb into a caf?,
shot a policeman,

19:38.408 --> 19:39.932
and then at his trial, he leaned over

19:40.010 --> 19:42.171
and punched the presiding official
on the nose.

19:42.245 --> 19:45.773
He got 14 years. He's our demolition man.

19:48.653 --> 19:50.280
Kostos Manov.

19:51.456 --> 19:54.948
Smuggling arms and explosives
into Egypt.

19:55.026 --> 19:57.221
They ran him in and I ran him out.

19:58.896 --> 20:00.887
First class armorer.

20:02.033 --> 20:03.591
Boudesh.

20:03.668 --> 20:04.930
Nice chap.

20:05.002 --> 20:07.493
Going a bit strong with an Egyptian girl.

20:07.572 --> 20:11.235
Her brothers came down to invite him
to his wedding. He shot them.

20:11.309 --> 20:14.039
Still a bachelor. Communications.

20:14.645 --> 20:17.546
Kafkarides, a Cypriot.

20:17.615 --> 20:21.210
His game was narcotics in a big way.
Shot a couple of customs men.

20:21.285 --> 20:23.947
Transport and supplies.

20:24.021 --> 20:28.721
Hassan and Assine, Sinusi Arab guides.

20:32.798 --> 20:35.130
Are they always so friendly?

20:35.634 --> 20:38.102
All they ask is keef and each other.

20:40.539 --> 20:41.938
That's everybody.

20:42.608 --> 20:45.168
Aren't you going to tell him
about me?

20:45.244 --> 20:48.543
I thought you might like
to do that yourself, Captain Leech.

20:49.481 --> 20:54.043
The black sheep of an otherwise
admirable family from County Dublin.

20:54.586 --> 20:56.486
Most recent deployment,

20:56.555 --> 20:59.581
master of a tramp steamer
running around the Red Sea.

20:59.658 --> 21:01.956
Sank her for the insurance off Djibouti.

21:02.027 --> 21:04.086
You ought to tell the crew, of course.

21:04.163 --> 21:07.964
They're all drowned, all but one of them.

21:08.034 --> 21:10.264
He told the insurance company.

21:11.037 --> 21:12.937
I got 15 years.

21:13.006 --> 21:15.600
When I met him in Rabida
prison, he was king of the damn place.

21:15.675 --> 21:19.509
They hated to see him go,
but I needed him more than they did.

21:20.680 --> 21:24.707
War is a criminal enterprise.
I fight it with criminals.

21:25.818 --> 21:29.219
Not to worry, my dear fellow.
Leech knows the routine.

21:29.289 --> 21:32.554
He'll get you out and he'll get you back.
Won't you, Leech?

21:34.194 --> 21:35.718
If he's lucky.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.198
Will I be lucky?

21:41.267 --> 21:44.259
That's up to you, and him, of course.

22:16.637 --> 22:18.104
Very Italian.

22:35.223 --> 22:36.554
Yeah.

22:38.226 --> 22:40.558
Nice morning for a drive, Captain.

22:40.962 --> 22:43.692
I ordered an inspection
for 7:00 this morning.

22:43.765 --> 22:46.666
I did it for you. All over.

22:47.402 --> 22:48.664
Let's go.

22:57.779 --> 22:59.474
Anything wrong?

23:19.368 --> 23:20.801
Good luck.

23:22.171 --> 23:23.934
And keep in touch.

23:26.208 --> 23:27.675
Let's go!

24:07.818 --> 24:09.217
This is as far as we can go, sir.

24:09.286 --> 24:12.153
The Germans have a few patrols
going south of here.

24:12.222 --> 24:13.712
Thank you, Corporal.

24:31.341 --> 24:34.004
Here we go to the right.

24:49.093 --> 24:51.493
I said we go right.

24:51.562 --> 24:55.396
That road was mined by the Italians
a week ago.

24:55.466 --> 24:57.525
They don't put it all on the map.

25:29.168 --> 25:30.829
Take another left.

26:09.209 --> 26:11.609
Splendid, Major Watkins. Good luck.

26:11.678 --> 26:13.168
Thank you, sir.

26:13.680 --> 26:15.409
Carry on, Lieutenant.

26:18.384 --> 26:20.249
Mount vehicles!

27:13.974 --> 27:16.101
Bara'sa.

27:16.176 --> 27:20.375
- What does that mean?
- They're Bara'sa. Could be dangerous.

27:20.448 --> 27:22.712
Depends who's paying them.

27:22.784 --> 27:24.877
Six men, six camels.

27:24.953 --> 27:26.818
No lead camel.

27:42.637 --> 27:45.868
They're an advance party.
The others could arrive any minute.

27:45.941 --> 27:47.909
Hassan's going to spot them.

27:49.210 --> 27:51.644
- We've got to have water.
- Exactly.

27:52.147 --> 27:55.708
We're Italians, aren't we?
Why don't we trade?

27:56.952 --> 27:59.682
You asking me or telling me?

27:59.754 --> 28:01.620
I'm asking you.

28:09.532 --> 28:12.194
There's an advance party
of Bara'sa at the oasis.

28:12.268 --> 28:15.965
We're an Italian patrol who need
food and water. Let's go to market.

28:20.776 --> 28:25.543
<i>Everybody else, parli Italiano.
And tune into an Italian radio station.</i>

28:45.802 --> 28:49.363
- I think we chose the right uniform.
- Don't be too sure.

28:49.439 --> 28:52.966
If they offer you tea, drink it.
If they offer you food, eat it.

31:04.244 --> 31:07.611
- What did you do that for?
- I didn't like the tea.

31:07.680 --> 31:09.875
See if there's anything we need
in the packs.

31:09.949 --> 31:11.678
Are you out of your mind?

31:12.752 --> 31:16.711
If anybody's going to get killed here,
I give the order.

31:16.790 --> 31:19.623
- Is that clear?
- Somebody gave the show away.

31:19.692 --> 31:22.991
- Who?
- You did.

31:26.666 --> 31:29.659
If you'd stayed at home,
they'd still be alive.

31:32.072 --> 31:34.734
Well, I didn't stay at home.

31:34.809 --> 31:36.743
And I'm not leaving.

31:49.890 --> 31:51.517
It's a German radio.

31:59.667 --> 32:03.262
Every patrol in the south would have been
on to us five hours after we left them.

32:03.337 --> 32:04.964
Destroy it.

32:17.018 --> 32:18.952
Fifty more Bara'sa coming.

32:19.020 --> 32:22.114
They're miles away.
They won't be here till nightfall.

32:23.725 --> 32:25.352
We can't go that way.

32:27.062 --> 32:28.791
We're not going back.

32:30.198 --> 32:33.133
Then there's only one other way
we can go.

32:36.271 --> 32:38.000
Is there a pass?

32:38.073 --> 32:40.940
Not for 120 miles, right down to Siwah.

32:42.510 --> 32:44.205
Let's have a look.

32:45.714 --> 32:47.181
All aboard!

32:51.087 --> 32:53.021
Aren't they going to bury them?

34:43.634 --> 34:45.534
We'll have to go back.

34:50.775 --> 34:54.541
- How long are these cables?
- About 250 feet each.

34:59.651 --> 35:01.414
That'll never work.

35:07.960 --> 35:10.155
Are we carrying any string?

35:12.164 --> 35:13.256
Yeah.

35:13.332 --> 35:14.424
Get it.

35:20.039 --> 35:21.267
Lead on.

35:55.975 --> 35:58.773
We need 327 feet.

35:58.845 --> 36:01.541
Sadok, shackle those cables together.

36:01.614 --> 36:03.138
- Are you strong?
- Yes.

36:03.216 --> 36:06.344
Then get the end of that cable
to the top of that cliff.

36:09.155 --> 36:11.817
- Aren't you coming up?
- No.

36:12.859 --> 36:16.386
Kafkarides, sand channels, pulleys
and tow chain.

36:31.779 --> 36:33.644
Unload those trucks!

37:51.761 --> 37:55.356
Take that down
and shackle it to the other truck.

37:55.431 --> 37:56.955
Yes, Captain.

39:46.612 --> 39:48.045
Hold it!

39:51.016 --> 39:52.608
Kostos Manov.

41:36.590 --> 41:38.922
- He says unload.
- Take it up.

42:32.548 --> 42:34.243
Are they ready?

42:35.017 --> 42:36.177
Yes.

42:36.686 --> 42:38.176
Take it away.

44:12.717 --> 44:14.548
Is that truck loaded?

44:20.024 --> 44:21.821
Foolish!

45:14.980 --> 45:16.641
Cable's going!

45:16.716 --> 45:18.183
Get down!

46:08.335 --> 46:10.997
Radio's gone. No more music.

46:12.006 --> 46:13.997
I ordered you to unload.

46:15.843 --> 46:16.969
Yes.

46:20.247 --> 46:22.044
Salvage what you can.

46:22.650 --> 46:25.551
We spend the night at
the top of the cliffs.

46:46.775 --> 46:48.538
Murdering bastards.

46:48.610 --> 46:50.544
Masters' men. Who else?

46:52.447 --> 46:54.005
Now every Arab for 200 miles

46:54.082 --> 46:57.017
knows there are British patrols
in the Qattara Depression.

46:57.085 --> 46:59.713
Do you think we should
change our course, sir?

46:59.788 --> 47:01.221
Impossible.

47:02.090 --> 47:04.285
This is the only track out of the Qattara.

47:04.359 --> 47:09.058
We got to keep going south
until we get to Siwah Pass.

47:09.431 --> 47:10.762
Very good, sir.

47:11.767 --> 47:13.667
- Lieutenant.
- Sir.

47:13.735 --> 47:15.999
Get these corpses buried.
They're beginning to stink.

47:16.071 --> 47:17.595
Certainly, sir.

47:18.039 --> 47:20.166
Get these corpses buried!

49:05.216 --> 49:06.581
Germans.

50:24.130 --> 50:25.256
Come.

53:07.531 --> 53:10.466
Our business is blowing fuel dumps.

55:39.487 --> 55:41.785
You play dirty, Captain Leech.

55:42.957 --> 55:45.721
The way to survive here is to watch,
listen and say nothing.

55:45.793 --> 55:47.226
I play safe.

57:03.272 --> 57:05.069
Good. Get the men.

57:37.373 --> 57:38.704
Bury them.

57:59.296 --> 58:00.627
Bury them!

58:24.189 --> 58:25.747
I think he means it.

59:16.942 --> 59:21.379
You'd have killed one of us, maybe two,
you'd have been the third.

59:21.447 --> 59:23.915
- I know.
- That wasn't very clever.

59:25.050 --> 59:28.315
You want to forget the noble sentiments
if you want to live.

59:28.387 --> 59:29.945
I'll manage.

59:30.789 --> 59:32.950
Funny thing, survival.

01:02:40.617 --> 01:02:44.713
We've only covered 80 kilometers
in the last two-and-a-half days.

01:02:45.923 --> 01:02:47.185
Quite good going.

01:02:47.257 --> 01:02:50.818
At this rate, the war will be over
before we get there.

01:02:50.894 --> 01:02:53.727
Don't worry, you'll get your medal.

01:04:10.810 --> 01:04:13.608
Why don't you say something?

01:04:13.679 --> 01:04:15.374
What?

01:04:15.447 --> 01:04:17.381
I said why don't you say something?

01:04:17.449 --> 01:04:19.940
Why don't you talk, like a human being?

01:04:22.188 --> 01:04:24.816
Because I want to survive here,

01:04:24.890 --> 01:04:28.417
I watch, I listen and I say nothing.

01:04:29.829 --> 01:04:33.765
In any case, Captain Leech,
I don't trust you,

01:04:33.833 --> 01:04:36.358
and I really don't want to know you.

01:04:36.869 --> 01:04:39.737
- All right.
- Tell me something.

01:04:41.708 --> 01:04:45.804
- How did the other English officers die?
- Unexpectedly.

01:06:39.761 --> 01:06:41.559
Must find new one.

01:06:42.065 --> 01:06:44.829
- What about spares?
- No more spares.

01:06:47.170 --> 01:06:50.435
If I'd done the inspection,
there'd be more spares.

01:07:05.421 --> 01:07:08.686
There may be some tires.
Let's have a look.

01:07:43.727 --> 01:07:47.424
We're getting close.
Better start traveling by night.

01:07:47.498 --> 01:07:49.625
Let's see if there's a tire.

01:07:58.909 --> 01:08:01.605
This looks like a good one that'll fit.

01:08:02.679 --> 01:08:04.511
There's a jack here.

01:08:07.318 --> 01:08:09.218
Keep perfectly still.

01:08:10.121 --> 01:08:11.611
Kostos Manov.

01:08:25.703 --> 01:08:27.363
See if it's wired.

01:09:11.951 --> 01:09:13.441
It is wired.

01:11:27.789 --> 01:11:29.154
Don't move.

01:11:33.963 --> 01:11:35.191
Hassan.

01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:38.928
Hassan.

01:12:11.434 --> 01:12:12.526
Okay.

01:12:29.753 --> 01:12:32.085
Are those
all the dressings you've got?

01:12:32.156 --> 01:12:34.420
We lost them in the wireless truck.

01:13:08.159 --> 01:13:10.286
Stop! Stop!

01:13:11.363 --> 01:13:12.660
Hold it!

01:13:14.232 --> 01:13:16.496
If we go on, Hassan will die!

01:13:16.568 --> 01:13:19.093
- Can't we leave them?
- We need them.

01:13:20.205 --> 01:13:23.231
There's a German supply road
only 20 miles from here.

01:13:23.308 --> 01:13:25.276
We'll have a look.

01:13:25.343 --> 01:13:27.368
We've got to keep going!

01:13:27.445 --> 01:13:28.673
Go on.

01:15:50.092 --> 01:15:51.616
You're learning.

01:15:53.161 --> 01:15:55.322
Kafkarides, get in the back.

01:15:56.932 --> 01:15:58.900
Come on, get in the front.

01:16:35.104 --> 01:16:36.628
It's all right.

01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:39.269
It's only a nurse.

01:17:55.854 --> 01:17:57.185
Hold that.

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:43.428
Don't you know how to handle a woman?

01:18:43.502 --> 01:18:44.901
Boudesh.

01:18:49.909 --> 01:18:50.933
No.

01:18:55.181 --> 01:18:57.012
She can take care of Hassan.

01:19:01.587 --> 01:19:04.112
If he dies, you die.

01:19:04.190 --> 01:19:05.555
Understand?

01:19:31.017 --> 01:19:32.541
Any luck?

01:19:32.619 --> 01:19:35.281
The receiver's gone,
but I think we can transmit.

01:19:35.355 --> 01:19:37.414
What time are we due to transmit?

01:19:41.261 --> 01:19:44.526
278 megacycles at 1922 hours.

01:19:45.732 --> 01:19:48.326
We'll try before we move off tonight.

01:22:17.321 --> 01:22:19.050
What happened here?

01:22:20.057 --> 01:22:21.285
Nothing.

01:22:33.237 --> 01:22:34.534
What are you telling them?

01:22:34.605 --> 01:22:36.574
I'm trying to explain
why we're six days late.

01:22:36.641 --> 01:22:40.099
Well, keep it short. We don't want
to be monitored by the Germans.

01:23:59.693 --> 01:24:01.024
That's it.

01:24:37.597 --> 01:24:40.089
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

01:24:41.235 --> 01:24:43.294
We go in now?

01:24:43.371 --> 01:24:46.340
Why not? It's perfect cover.

01:24:46.407 --> 01:24:49.672
You won't be very popular.

01:24:49.744 --> 01:24:51.473
With them or with you?

01:24:51.546 --> 01:24:54.845
Don't worry about me. Worry about them.

01:25:13.301 --> 01:25:17.260
We're going in under cover of this storm.

01:25:17.338 --> 01:25:18.828
Come on.

01:25:58.180 --> 01:26:03.813
Sadok, tell him if she causes trouble,

01:26:03.887 --> 01:26:06.287
to kill her quietly with this.

01:27:02.580 --> 01:27:03.774
Mines!

01:27:03.847 --> 01:27:04.973
Mines!

01:27:18.028 --> 01:27:19.222
Captain.

01:27:20.764 --> 01:27:22.459
Keep in my footsteps.

01:27:53.498 --> 01:27:55.398
I'm going ahead.

01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:24.431
Bastards!

01:32:58.578 --> 01:33:02.173
Well, this mission's over.
Now we can go home.

01:33:03.950 --> 01:33:05.713
I'm in command here.

01:33:07.353 --> 01:33:11.084
We're going to find the real fuel depot
and destroy it.

01:33:11.157 --> 01:33:13.489
Well, go ahead.

01:33:13.559 --> 01:33:15.424
Give them your orders.

01:33:25.237 --> 01:33:28.934
Right. We're going to find
the real fuel depot.

01:33:30.476 --> 01:33:31.773
Come on.

01:34:12.919 --> 01:34:15.251
Me, I'm going to find a boat.

01:34:15.322 --> 01:34:17.017
Anyone interested?

01:34:34.709 --> 01:34:37.610
You don't care about anything, do you?

01:34:37.679 --> 01:34:41.342
I care about you.
That's why I've been looking after you.

01:34:41.416 --> 01:34:44.146
Masters is paying me
to bring you back alive.

01:34:44.218 --> 01:34:45.583
How much?

01:34:47.088 --> 01:34:48.316
£2,000.

01:35:33.268 --> 01:35:35.259
Want a ride, Captain?

01:35:43.847 --> 01:35:45.075
Come in.

01:35:55.658 --> 01:35:56.920
Sit down.

01:36:07.737 --> 01:36:10.831
This aerial photograph
shows your oil dump is still intact.

01:36:10.907 --> 01:36:13.273
You seem to have failed again.

01:36:18.214 --> 01:36:19.374
I'm afraid so, sir.

01:36:19.449 --> 01:36:23.385
That's all right, Masters.
In fact, it's exactly what we want.

01:36:24.021 --> 01:36:27.013
Montgomery has broken through.
He's moving fast along the coast.

01:36:27.091 --> 01:36:30.424
By tomorrow night, we'll be in Cyrenaica,
by the weekend, Benghazi.

01:36:30.494 --> 01:36:31.961
I knew things were moving, sir, but...

01:36:32.029 --> 01:36:34.964
So our conventional methods
do seem to have paid off.

01:36:35.032 --> 01:36:36.738
Quite.

01:36:36.751 --> 01:36:38.468
So, I shall want you
to call your chaps off.

01:36:38.536 --> 01:36:41.869
I can't do that, sir.
I've lost contact with them.

01:36:41.939 --> 01:36:45.898
I've had orders to capture all fuel depots.
We need them.

01:36:45.976 --> 01:36:47.204
What can I do, sir?

01:36:47.278 --> 01:36:51.339
Don't you know of a reliable double agent?
Get in touch.

01:36:51.415 --> 01:36:54.213
You want me to inform
against my own men, sir?

01:36:54.285 --> 01:36:56.617
Do you know any other way
of stopping them?

01:36:56.687 --> 01:36:58.052
- Is this an order, sir?
- Yes.

01:36:58.122 --> 01:37:00.556
- Then may I have it in writing, please?
- No.

01:37:00.624 --> 01:37:02.922
But you'd be well advised to do it.

01:37:06.398 --> 01:37:09.629
- I'll see what I can do, sir.
- Do it.

01:38:42.129 --> 01:38:43.323
Boats.

01:38:45.699 --> 01:38:48.725
- Petrol.
- Forget the petrol.

01:38:48.802 --> 01:38:51.703
As soon as it's dark,
I'll be on one of those boats.

01:38:51.772 --> 01:38:53.433
I'll feel safer.

01:38:55.842 --> 01:38:57.639
I'm sure you will.

01:39:00.113 --> 01:39:02.581
I think I have an idea.

01:39:02.649 --> 01:39:04.378
What's that?

01:39:04.451 --> 01:39:05.975
Create a diversion.

01:39:06.987 --> 01:39:08.955
Blow the fuel dump,

01:39:09.022 --> 01:39:12.083
and while they're fighting fires,
grab a boat.

01:39:13.428 --> 01:39:16.454
- You're still trying to win a medal.
- No.

01:39:17.031 --> 01:39:19.693
I don't think I'll get a medal.

01:39:19.801 --> 01:39:21.530
But you'll get your boat.

01:39:25.340 --> 01:39:27.171
We can give it a try.

01:39:38.886 --> 01:39:41.218
What are you telling them now?

01:39:41.289 --> 01:39:43.553
We attack at midnight tonight.

01:40:26.502 --> 01:40:27.992
Let's go.

01:46:41.285 --> 01:46:45.313
<i>Put down your guns and stand up.</i>

01:46:45.390 --> 01:46:48.018
<i>First, come forward.</i>

01:46:48.093 --> 01:46:52.655
<i>148525.</i>

01:46:52.731 --> 01:46:56.189
<i>Captain R. V. Douglas.</i>

01:46:56.268 --> 01:46:58.236
<i>Royal Engineers.</i>

01:46:59.504 --> 01:47:02.200
<i>Second, Cyril Leech.</i>

01:47:03.508 --> 01:47:05.669
<i>Third, Sadok.</i>

01:47:06.511 --> 01:47:09.969
<i>Fourth, Kostos Manov.</i>

01:47:10.048 --> 01:47:12.744
<i>Fifth, Kafkarides.</i>

01:47:13.885 --> 01:47:16.251
<i>Sixth, Hassan.</i>

01:47:16.822 --> 01:47:19.154
<i>Seventh, Assine.</i>

01:47:20.091 --> 01:47:22.889
<i>Stand up and come forward.</i>

01:47:22.961 --> 01:47:25.623
<i>You are surrounded.</i>

01:47:25.697 --> 01:47:28.132
<i>I repeat.</i>

01:47:28.201 --> 01:47:31.398
<i>We know you are here.</i>

01:47:31.471 --> 01:47:33.098
<i>Come out at once.</i>

01:47:44.250 --> 01:47:48.050
You shoot that one.

01:47:48.955 --> 01:47:52.550
I'll shoot this one.

01:47:59.298 --> 01:48:02.233
Throw the charges that way and go.

01:48:15.148 --> 01:48:16.240
Go.

01:48:28.629 --> 01:48:32.258
Wait. Throw the charges that way,
but follow me.

01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:42.711
How did they know our names?

01:52:43.856 --> 01:52:45.551
Masters told them.

01:52:47.093 --> 01:52:50.859
- Why would he do that?
- Stop us blowing the oil.

01:52:50.963 --> 01:52:53.454
They must have changed their minds.

01:52:54.467 --> 01:52:58.062
If he betrayed us, he deserves to be shot.

01:52:59.406 --> 01:53:02.307
What does it matter who betrayed us?

01:53:02.376 --> 01:53:06.142
The Germans can catch you.
You can trip over a mine.

01:53:06.213 --> 01:53:08.408
It's the principle of the thing.

01:53:10.050 --> 01:53:13.144
You sound like the man
who gave me 15 years.

01:53:16.890 --> 01:53:21.327
I wouldn't be here now
if I wasn't worth £2,000 to you.

01:53:22.329 --> 01:53:23.591
Would I?

01:53:26.033 --> 01:53:27.523
Probably not.

01:53:40.715 --> 01:53:42.114
Lie still.

01:53:44.886 --> 01:53:46.183
Assine.

01:53:48.456 --> 01:53:49.650
Assine.

01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:54.227
Assine.

01:53:56.931 --> 01:53:58.262
Assine.

01:54:22.224 --> 01:54:25.990
- Well, the news is wonderful, isn't it?
- It is rather good, sir, isn't it?

01:54:26.061 --> 01:54:29.258
- Not too late for another drink, is it?
- No, indeed, sir.

01:54:29.331 --> 01:54:32.300
By the way, congratulations.

01:54:32.368 --> 01:54:36.361
- I gather you reached your chaps.
- Yes. It would appear so, sir.

01:54:37.373 --> 01:54:41.139
I had one or two notions about stirring
up a little trouble in Tripolitania.

01:54:41.210 --> 01:54:45.874
Tell me more. But first, here's to Monty.
And here's to victory.

01:54:46.949 --> 01:54:48.075
To victory.

01:55:11.675 --> 01:55:13.666
- They're British.
- I know.

01:55:17.013 --> 01:55:19.811
- Have you got anything white?
- No.

01:55:22.686 --> 01:55:24.210
I should wait.

01:55:35.465 --> 01:55:38.923
If you're going to surrender,
I should leave the pistol.

01:55:52.750 --> 01:55:54.445
Come on, Cyril.

01:55:55.052 --> 01:55:57.111
Don't you want your£2,000?

01:56:46.238 --> 01:56:48.399
Sorry, sir. I didn't see the white flag.

01:56:48.473 --> 01:56:50.134
Don't do it again.
