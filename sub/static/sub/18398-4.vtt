00:00.039 --> 00:02.159
Okay, so this is what
happened before on Star.

00:02.161 --> 00:04.276
There's a big music festival
coming here to Atlanta,

00:04.278 --> 00:06.470
the perfect venue to
introduce you to the world.

00:06.471 --> 00:08.167
You got to submit a
demo, and the deadline

00:08.169 --> 00:10.236
is in two days. Yes!

00:10.237 --> 00:12.576
- You don't think people will see us?
- That's the point, Simone.

00:12.578 --> 00:14.745
So, you really don't think people
aren't gonna be looking for us.

00:14.759 --> 00:18.227
Star! Stop it! You killed him!

00:18.245 --> 00:19.711
I'm looking for Star.

00:19.713 --> 00:21.613
They at the hospital with her sister.

00:21.615 --> 00:22.839
Most girls come when I call.

00:22.864 --> 00:25.523
You're going to have to do a lot
more than call to make me come.

00:25.525 --> 00:27.274
I didn't sign up for trafficking women.

00:27.299 --> 00:29.121

00:43.270 --> 00:45.270
but it ain't that easy.

00:45.272 --> 00:48.373
Not when the devil

01:06.299 --> 01:07.559
what I'm gonna to do to them.

01:07.561 --> 01:10.829
You said that last year and lost.

01:10.831 --> 01:12.277
Doris, I'm-a need you
to worry about paying for

01:12.301 --> 01:13.571
your hair on time,
something you never do.

01:13.573 --> 01:15.200
Yeah. But you did say that last year.

01:15.202 --> 01:17.002
Oh, no, I'm serious
this year, baby. Watch.

01:17.004 --> 01:19.038
They don't know how I'm
getting ready to slay them.

01:19.039 --> 01:20.405
Where's Danielle?

01:20.407 --> 01:22.808
She went to ask her aunt for a favor.

01:22.810 --> 01:24.176
You know, the girls are performing

01:24.178 --> 01:26.378
a Gladys Knight remix at the hair show.

01:26.380 --> 01:28.320
Here we go with this Gladys
Knight stuff again. I can't...

01:28.321 --> 01:29.653
Y'all know damn good and well that girl

01:29.655 --> 01:30.983
ain't no kin to Gladys Knight.

01:30.985 --> 01:33.085
She been saying that same lie for years.

01:33.087 --> 01:34.830
Why do you always have something to say?

01:34.855 --> 01:36.021
Why we ain't never met her?

01:36.023 --> 01:37.929
Well, why everybody
got to be a liar, Bruce?

01:37.930 --> 01:40.092
And at this point, anything will help.

01:40.094 --> 01:41.527
Gladys Knight?

01:41.529 --> 01:42.995
Uh-huh. Did I ever tell you

01:42.997 --> 01:45.030
I was six months
pregnant by Tyler Perry?

01:45.032 --> 01:47.733
Shut up, Bruce.

01:47.735 --> 01:49.368
Sorry about that. Where were we?

01:49.370 --> 01:51.437
Uh, don't mind me.

01:51.438 --> 01:53.038
Beautiful girls you got here, Carlotta.

01:53.040 --> 01:55.040
Are the black kids yours?

01:55.042 --> 01:56.909
No, they ain't mine.

01:56.911 --> 01:58.677
Might as well be, though.

02:00.214 --> 02:01.914
Y'all are funny.

02:01.916 --> 02:03.949
And I ain't talking
about those sweet boys

02:03.951 --> 02:05.918
you got here.

02:05.920 --> 02:08.220
All right, you've been
straight up with me.

02:08.222 --> 02:10.021
So I'm gonna be straight up with you.

02:10.024 --> 02:11.708
Why you want to work here?

02:16.047 --> 02:17.262
Well,

02:17.264 --> 02:20.699

- running around here.
- Hold on, don't get it twisted, sweetie.

02:48.234 --> 02:49.928
I'm more of a man than you will ever be

02:49.952 --> 02:51.763
and more of a woman
than you will ever get.

02:51.765 --> 02:54.499
Carlotta, you better
get Sheba out of here.

02:54.524 --> 02:56.902
Oh, no. Come on. Don't get it wrong.

02:56.904 --> 02:59.623
Ain't nothing wrong with a
little sugar in your tank, baby.

03:01.993 --> 03:04.276
Women ain't the only ones
that want to look good.

03:04.278 --> 03:06.496
I'm just laying out facts.

03:07.632 --> 03:09.265
Think about it.

03:11.869 --> 03:15.320
Man comes in, gets a haircut.
He leaves looking all smooth,

03:15.322 --> 03:17.161
feeling good, goes home.
His lady's gonna ask him

03:17.163 --> 03:18.690
where he got his hair cut.

03:18.692 --> 03:21.143
Next thing you know,
they're both calling here

03:21.145 --> 03:22.746
booking appointments.

03:24.882 --> 03:27.132
Get up, he's here. Get up, he's here.

03:27.134 --> 03:28.968
- No. Who?
- Otis.

03:28.969 --> 03:30.268
What?

03:30.270 --> 03:32.204
Oh, no, it's too... It's... Mm-mm.

03:32.206 --> 03:34.112
- It's too early for this.
- No, I heard him talking to Miss Carlotta.

03:34.113 --> 03:36.208
What if he's telling her
that you tried to kill him?

03:36.210 --> 03:37.649
Okay. What you heard is that medication

03:37.650 --> 03:39.411
- they got you on.
- Girl, wake up.

03:39.413 --> 03:41.219
- You know it have side effects.
- I know what them doctors said.

03:41.220 --> 03:42.581
If you don't quit touching me...

03:42.583 --> 03:44.083
You know what?

03:44.084 --> 03:45.851
I swear to God.

03:45.853 --> 03:47.525
He better be down there
or I'm-a kill you, too.

03:47.526 --> 03:48.620
I swear he's down there.

03:48.622 --> 03:50.684
I know what I heard.

03:50.709 --> 03:52.024
I'm not playing with you today.

03:54.300 --> 03:56.862
Um, Miss Carlotta,

03:56.864 --> 03:58.764
was there a man down here a minute ago?

03:58.766 --> 04:00.833
Well, good morning to you, too.

04:00.834 --> 04:03.301
Yeah. He was applying for a job.

04:03.303 --> 04:04.903
A man, though, right?

04:04.905 --> 04:06.739
Yeah. Why you want to know?

04:06.740 --> 04:08.407
Stay out my business.

04:08.409 --> 04:10.309
You sounding more like Star.

04:10.310 --> 04:13.412
Some people actually want to work.

04:13.414 --> 04:15.147
I actually want to go to bed.

04:15.149 --> 04:18.317
While you up, I need these
cleaned, separated and labeled.

04:18.317 --> 04:20.317
Miss Carlotta, it's the crack of dawn.

04:20.320 --> 04:21.925
If you want to win the hair
show this year, don't you think

04:21.927 --> 04:23.655
your main attraction
should get some sleep?

04:23.657 --> 04:24.840
Lazy.

04:25.712 --> 04:27.698
Hey, Ma, they have been
rehearsing all night.

04:27.700 --> 04:28.760
Thank you, Kai.

04:28.762 --> 04:30.896
All right. Go on back to bed,

04:30.898 --> 04:33.432
but don't think you getting
out of working that booth.

04:33.434 --> 04:34.985
We know.

04:36.421 --> 04:39.604
Star, I swear it was him.

04:39.606 --> 04:41.006
You got to stop doing this.

04:41.008 --> 04:43.342
You're driving yourself crazy, Simone.

04:43.343 --> 04:45.544
You won't sleep. You won't
let nobody else sleep now.

04:45.546 --> 04:47.146
You got to let this go.

04:47.147 --> 04:50.031
Otis isn't alive, 'cause he's dead,

04:50.056 --> 04:51.717
'cause I killed him.

04:51.719 --> 04:54.237
Please try to remember that.

05:02.914 --> 05:05.263
Hey, Miss Ruby. What's going on?

05:05.265 --> 05:06.665
Hey, little girl.

05:06.667 --> 05:08.801
Go ask Bruce to get me a blunt.

05:08.802 --> 05:10.502
Grandma, go inside.

05:10.504 --> 05:12.471
I won't. Go ask Bruce.

05:12.473 --> 05:14.558
And you take your ass to work.

05:18.663 --> 05:20.879
She right. Let me get to work.

05:20.881 --> 05:24.283
So, you're gonna be at work all day?

05:24.284 --> 05:27.419
Why? You got a better offer?

05:27.421 --> 05:29.088
I just might.

05:29.089 --> 05:30.555
You know about the hair show, right?

05:30.557 --> 05:31.762
Yeah, we know about
it. What you know about

05:31.764 --> 05:33.558
- the hair show?
- Grandma, please!

05:33.560 --> 05:35.727
I know about that damn
hair show every year,

05:35.729 --> 05:37.262
'cause every year Carlotta and Bruce

05:37.264 --> 05:38.664
lose to the Scissor Siblings.

05:38.665 --> 05:40.298
Wait, they got y'all going?

05:40.300 --> 05:41.967
Performing. Bruce is styling

05:41.969 --> 05:44.236
and we're singing Gladys Knight.

05:44.238 --> 05:45.376
So, God's Blessing actually may

05:45.377 --> 05:46.938
bring home the trophy this year, then.

05:46.940 --> 05:48.840
I don't know. It's
the full-on retro sound

05:48.842 --> 05:50.776
and look, crazy wigs and all.

05:50.778 --> 05:53.133
You should see Star. She
looks like a blonde mushroom.

05:55.433 --> 05:57.582
So, you finally invite
me to hear you sing.

05:57.584 --> 05:59.084
Yeah.

05:59.086 --> 06:02.138
Too bad you're gonna be at work.

06:03.708 --> 06:06.291
Mmm. Well, I wonder if there's anything

06:06.293 --> 06:08.126
I wouldn't do for you.

06:08.128 --> 06:10.096
We're on at 3:00 sharp.

06:12.250 --> 06:13.999
I'll see what I can do.

06:14.001 --> 06:17.169
- Can I come?
- No.

06:17.170 --> 06:19.471
Ugh. Girlie,

06:19.473 --> 06:22.325
go tell Bruce to bring me a hit.

06:25.062 --> 06:26.978

You good?

Yeah.

08:47.421 --> 08:48.453
What's going on?

08:48.455 --> 08:51.223
Simone's being crazy.

08:51.224 --> 08:52.323
Come on, you guys.

08:52.325 --> 08:55.794
We need to be ready for tonight.

09:15.533 --> 09:18.016
I need your attention, ladies.

09:19.352 --> 09:20.652
What's up, bro?

09:20.654 --> 09:22.621
What do you want?

09:22.622 --> 09:25.056
You need to learn some
respect, little girl.

09:25.058 --> 09:27.225
Here, take a look at this. Go ahead.

09:27.227 --> 09:29.528
Read it. Tell me what it says.

09:29.529 --> 09:32.497
"Congratulations, you've been
selected for the next round

09:32.499 --> 09:34.238
of the Atlanta NextFest at
the Honda Stage Competition."

09:36.703 --> 09:39.204
All right, look. I just spoke
with the reps. Now they want

09:39.206 --> 09:41.212
to see a video of you all
doing a live performance.

09:41.213 --> 09:43.274
That means we got a
new deadline, two weeks.

09:43.276 --> 09:45.115
Okay, well Derek's having
a Black Lives Matter event.

09:45.117 --> 09:46.344
Maybe we can do it then.

09:46.346 --> 09:48.146
Nah, I don't want to do political.

09:48.148 --> 09:50.549
Why don't we sing at Miss
Carlotta's church benefit?

09:50.550 --> 09:52.750
You're so cute, you little nut job.

09:52.752 --> 09:54.085
No, that's not sexy enough.

09:54.087 --> 09:55.671
We need these stiffs to stand up.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.928
What about the hair show
we're performing at tonight?

09:57.930 --> 10:00.197
We're already doing it, and
the judges at Atlanta NextFest

10:00.199 --> 10:02.393
would never expect us to
do a Gladys Knight song.

10:02.395 --> 10:04.888
You know, that's retro. Shows
your history, shows your taste.

10:04.913 --> 10:05.763
I like it.

10:05.765 --> 10:08.538
- Bow down to Gladys.
- Well, you know what?

10:08.563 --> 10:11.274
That's... That's why I love you.
Come here. That is a great idea.

10:11.276 --> 10:13.276
I mean, there's gonna be, like,
hundreds of people there, right?

10:13.278 --> 10:14.506
- Thousands.
- All right.

10:14.508 --> 10:16.141
Hair show it is.

10:16.143 --> 10:17.776
Well, come on.

10:17.777 --> 10:19.611
Show me what you got. Let's go.

10:19.613 --> 10:22.581
We did it!

10:55.468 --> 10:57.635
What... come on. Five more minutes.

10:57.637 --> 11:00.571
I'm gonna be late for the show.

11:00.573 --> 11:04.609
Right. The hair show that
you didn't invite me to.

11:04.611 --> 11:06.043
Aw.

11:06.045 --> 11:08.179
I'm kidding.

11:08.181 --> 11:09.814
You know I want you there.

11:18.975 --> 11:19.957
Rules.

11:19.959 --> 11:22.360
Right.

11:22.362 --> 11:23.661
Rules.

11:23.663 --> 11:25.263
Very important rules.

11:25.265 --> 11:27.899
What exactly can't we do?

11:27.901 --> 11:29.834
No sex before a performance.

11:34.707 --> 11:36.607
Well, I think I might've
found a loophole.

11:45.785 --> 11:47.518
Let me borrow your hair tie.

11:53.927 --> 11:55.559
Okay.

11:58.164 --> 11:59.931
Oh, my God, you're crazier than me.

12:02.802 --> 12:03.834
How do I look?

12:03.836 --> 12:05.836
Adorable.

12:10.810 --> 12:12.276
Knock yourself out.

12:17.801 --> 12:19.717
Eva?

12:19.719 --> 12:22.137
ÿEstás aquí?

12:23.840 --> 12:25.140
Eva.

12:25.604 --> 12:28.092
ÿEstás aquí? Oye.

12:28.094 --> 12:30.432
ÿEstás bien?

12:30.457 --> 12:32.276
ÿQué? ÿQué pasó? ÿQué pasó?

12:32.301 --> 12:33.520
_

12:33.545 --> 12:35.246
_

12:35.271 --> 12:36.587
What-What did he look like?

12:36.612 --> 12:38.696
_

12:38.721 --> 12:41.066
_

12:44.974 --> 12:45.837
_

12:45.862 --> 12:48.479
It's because I let you girls go.

12:48.481 --> 12:50.381
All right, here's what we're gonna do.

12:50.383 --> 12:52.934
We're gonna get out of here.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.199
We're open seven days a week,

13:08.201 --> 13:09.639
so just call and make
an appointment anytime.

13:09.641 --> 13:11.040
We'll be more than
happy to take you, okay?

13:11.042 --> 13:12.636
Your hair is beautiful, by the way.

13:12.638 --> 13:14.577
That's right, baby,
we got wigs, closures,

13:14.579 --> 13:16.379
- weaves, anything you need, baby.
- And I want to give you one of these

13:16.381 --> 13:18.247
because I think this would
be a great texture for you.

13:18.249 --> 13:20.194
Mm, mm, mm.

13:20.196 --> 13:21.478
Ugh.

13:21.503 --> 13:23.080
What is this?

13:23.082 --> 13:24.382
Just tired.

13:24.384 --> 13:25.449
The ugly sisters.

13:25.451 --> 13:26.817
Y'all got five seconds

13:26.819 --> 13:28.519
to get y'all peculiar ass from my booth.

13:28.521 --> 13:29.987
Let it go. It ain't worth it.

13:29.989 --> 13:32.690
- Oh, really? That ain't what Yelp said.
- Mm.

13:32.692 --> 13:34.225
One.

13:34.227 --> 13:35.693
What was it the review said?

13:35.695 --> 13:37.762
Oh, let me find out.

13:37.764 --> 13:38.973
Two.

13:38.998 --> 13:40.331
Scissor Siblings ranked

13:40.333 --> 13:42.767
best beauty salon in Atlanta.

13:42.769 --> 13:43.606
Three.

13:43.631 --> 13:46.103
Or was it the best beauty salon period?

13:46.105 --> 13:47.505
- Four.
- Mm-hmm, look,

13:47.507 --> 13:48.911
do you remember how many stars we got?

13:48.913 --> 13:49.774
Let's count them up.

13:49.776 --> 13:51.042
- Five.
- Five. Five.

13:51.044 --> 13:53.611
Enough. Save it for the stage.

13:53.613 --> 13:56.064
We already did that.

13:56.377 --> 13:58.793
Y'all ain't make no noise.

13:58.818 --> 14:00.923
Oh, honey, we left that
stage in awe, though.

14:00.925 --> 14:02.291
You gonna have to do a whole lot more

14:02.293 --> 14:04.255
than them little
synthetic dresses, baby.

14:04.257 --> 14:06.857
You left 'em in "Aw, hell nah."

14:06.859 --> 14:09.660
And you're too young to have
your hair like that anyway.

14:14.351 --> 14:17.068
S'up, Hunter?

14:17.070 --> 14:19.270
Surprised to see you here.

14:19.272 --> 14:20.910
Oh, I'm just here being
a supportive boyfriend.

14:20.912 --> 14:21.939
Boyfriend?

14:21.941 --> 14:24.141
Yeah.

14:24.143 --> 14:25.743
Who's this?

14:25.745 --> 14:26.777
This is Eva.

14:26.779 --> 14:28.212
Eva?

14:28.214 --> 14:29.947
Never seen her around before.

14:29.949 --> 14:31.759
She your latest addition to Magic City?

14:31.784 --> 14:33.027
Actually, she's my niece.

14:33.052 --> 14:35.719
My brother sent her to stay
with me for a little while.

14:35.721 --> 14:36.821
Where are the girls?

14:36.823 --> 14:38.355
Uh, in the back getting ready.

14:38.357 --> 14:39.386
All right, look, do me a favor.

14:39.410 --> 14:41.393
Keep an eye on her for a minute. Thanks.

14:41.418 --> 14:43.355
_

14:43.771 --> 14:44.886
And listen,

14:44.911 --> 14:46.862
keep your hands to yourself.

14:51.955 --> 14:54.255
You're not from around here, are you?

14:55.092 --> 14:57.058
Hola.

14:58.695 --> 15:01.378
Step close because up
next on the main stage,

15:01.380 --> 15:02.847
another live performance

15:02.849 --> 15:05.683
from one of Atlanta's
hottest new salons.

15:05.685 --> 15:08.236
Don't you miss it.

15:09.973 --> 15:11.889
Girl, is she gonna be okay?

15:11.891 --> 15:14.825
- Simone?
- Yes.

15:14.827 --> 15:16.605
She's gonna be fine.
She don't have a choice.

15:17.715 --> 15:18.964
Look, you can't make her

15:18.989 --> 15:20.447
do something if she's not ready.

15:20.472 --> 15:21.966
You and I can handle it.

15:21.968 --> 15:23.639
Right, and she did just
get out the hospital.

15:23.641 --> 15:24.568
What if she's tired?

15:24.570 --> 15:27.004
Thank you.

15:27.006 --> 15:28.010
We started this together.

15:28.012 --> 15:29.045
We're gonna finish this together.

15:29.047 --> 15:30.925
Girl, look at her.

15:32.829 --> 15:35.096
You gonna do something to get ready?

15:36.873 --> 15:38.387
You know what?

15:38.389 --> 15:39.750
So obnoxious, yo.

15:39.752 --> 15:42.453
Ladies, I have someone

15:42.455 --> 15:44.121
who would like to wish you good luck.

15:44.123 --> 15:46.557
I want you to meet my Aunt Gladys.

15:48.194 --> 15:49.860
How you guys doing?

15:49.862 --> 15:50.995
How are you?

15:50.997 --> 15:53.864
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.

15:53.866 --> 15:55.125
Oh, my God, hi.

15:55.150 --> 15:56.367
- Hi.
- My mother loved you.

15:56.369 --> 15:58.035
- Oh, thank you so much.
- Hi.

15:58.037 --> 15:59.537
Ms. Knight, I know you

15:59.539 --> 16:01.572
probably won't remember me, but...

16:01.574 --> 16:03.174
Roland's daughter.

16:03.176 --> 16:04.708
Yeah.

16:04.710 --> 16:07.111
- Of course I remember you.
- Wow.

16:07.113 --> 16:10.281
When you did the piano
duet with Alicia Keys.

16:10.283 --> 16:12.850
Oh, my God, I was so nervous.

16:12.852 --> 16:14.151
You were brilliant.

16:14.153 --> 16:16.220
And your dad?

16:16.222 --> 16:19.557
He's in New York right now.

16:19.559 --> 16:21.025
So, what are you doing here?

16:21.027 --> 16:25.196
Well, you told me to chase
my dreams, so here I am.

16:25.198 --> 16:27.231
You've done something brave.

16:27.233 --> 16:30.401
Believing in yourself
is half the battle,

16:30.403 --> 16:33.837
and if nothing else
happens, you've already won.

16:33.839 --> 16:35.139
Oh, my God, really?

16:35.141 --> 16:36.707
Come on, man. I need y'all to focus.

16:36.709 --> 16:38.333
Cotton, why you in the mirror?

16:38.358 --> 16:40.945
Miss Bruce.

16:40.947 --> 16:42.327
Hey.

16:42.352 --> 16:44.114
My Aunt Gladys.

16:44.116 --> 16:46.750
Well, I'll be damned.

16:48.120 --> 16:50.054
Hey, you guys, I'm
gonna let you go, okay.

16:50.056 --> 16:51.488
I know you got to get ready.

16:51.490 --> 16:53.257
- I'll be out there watching.
- Okay.

16:53.259 --> 16:54.764
Let's get our seats before we lose them.

16:54.766 --> 16:55.859
Let's get our seats.

16:55.861 --> 16:58.095
- Ms. Knight, before you go...
- Yes?

16:58.097 --> 17:01.465
...I'd like to ask you a huge favor.

17:01.467 --> 17:04.602
Welcome back to this year's legendary

17:04.604 --> 17:06.103
Taylor Brothers Hair Battle.

17:06.105 --> 17:08.405
And what a battle it has been.

17:08.406 --> 17:11.976
Scissor Siblings versus
Yolanda's Nappy Kitchen

17:11.978 --> 17:14.845
versus God's Blessings Salon.

17:14.847 --> 17:17.513
And can we please give
a round of applause

17:17.516 --> 17:19.083
for our esteemed judges:

17:19.085 --> 17:20.984
Keena 360,

17:20.987 --> 17:23.954
Terrence Davidson and Porsha Porsche.

17:23.955 --> 17:26.924
We have a special guest here

17:26.925 --> 17:29.260
to introduce one of her favorite salons.

17:29.262 --> 17:31.478
And I want to just say
it's an honor for me

17:31.480 --> 17:33.831
to be able to bring her up onstage.

17:33.833 --> 17:34.999
She's a living legend,

17:35.001 --> 17:39.603
an icon, Ms. Gladys Knight.

17:44.494 --> 17:48.545
I am so proud to introduce,

17:48.547 --> 17:51.849
and I'm honored that they're
performing for you tonight

17:51.851 --> 17:54.685

Girl, bye.

21:14.967 --> 21:17.935
Alex, he's here.

21:17.937 --> 21:19.169
Who?

21:19.171 --> 21:22.406
Simone's foster dad is at the hair show.

21:22.408 --> 21:24.942
That's him right there in the plaid.

21:24.944 --> 21:27.478
- Has Simone seen him?
- No, not yet.

21:27.480 --> 21:29.772
- Please just go.
- Stay close...

21:29.797 --> 21:31.448
- All right.
- Go.

21:31.450 --> 21:33.751
...Yolanda's Nappy Kitchen.

21:35.721 --> 21:38.088
- Where we going?
- Back to Carlotta's.

21:38.090 --> 21:40.591
Why? We just killed our performance.

21:40.593 --> 21:42.233
We just need to go, okay?

21:42.258 --> 21:43.624
I need your help.

21:43.649 --> 21:45.462
He's here.

21:45.464 --> 21:48.316
Yes.

21:50.186 --> 21:52.970
Hey, little mama.

21:52.972 --> 21:56.224
How you doing?

21:57.360 --> 21:58.976
Where are we going?

21:58.978 --> 22:02.412
Alex, hello? Hello?

22:02.414 --> 22:04.432
Otis is here, Simone.

22:05.902 --> 22:07.818
Now, I'm not leaving
without my daughter.

22:07.820 --> 22:10.521
Simone is not your daughter,

22:10.523 --> 22:12.723
and she's not going anywhere with you.

22:12.725 --> 22:16.126
Listen, girl, you do not
want me to go to the police.

22:16.128 --> 22:18.334
'Cause if I do, I'm gonna
make sure your little white ass

22:18.336 --> 22:19.530
is living up under the jail.

22:19.532 --> 22:21.598
Your sister saw him.

22:21.600 --> 22:23.467
He was in the audience.
He saw us performing.

22:23.469 --> 22:24.768
Where is she?

22:24.770 --> 22:26.442
She went to go look
for him, but it's okay.

22:26.444 --> 22:28.605
- No. Let go of me.
- Simone...

22:28.607 --> 22:30.441
- I have to take you back to Carlotta's.
- No, I...

22:30.443 --> 22:31.909
- Just, please let's go, Simone.
- Alex?

22:31.911 --> 22:33.310
Call them.

22:33.312 --> 22:35.112
And while you're at it,

22:35.114 --> 22:37.314
tell them how you raped Simone.

22:37.316 --> 22:40.017
How I saw you.

22:40.019 --> 22:42.586
I like that.

22:42.588 --> 22:44.254
Yeah, baby doll.

22:44.256 --> 22:48.125
See, you, you stabbed me.

22:48.127 --> 22:51.145
Tried to kill me.

22:51.147 --> 22:53.664
Thought you did.

22:53.666 --> 22:55.632
See, what you're gonna do

22:55.634 --> 22:57.267
is you're gonna bring her to me

22:57.269 --> 22:58.468
or I'm gonna call the cops.

22:58.470 --> 23:01.071
- I got to go.
- Where you going?

23:01.073 --> 23:03.974
And that will be kidnapping,

23:03.976 --> 23:05.843
assault with a deadly weapon,

23:05.845 --> 23:08.221
attempted murder

23:08.246 --> 23:09.797
and stealing my damn car.

23:11.183 --> 23:12.516
Who does that?

23:12.518 --> 23:13.951
Hey, hey, hey.

23:13.953 --> 23:16.653
You can't just leave me
here by myself, Cotton.

23:16.655 --> 23:19.623
You looking at a long
time, you little whore.

23:19.625 --> 23:21.792
Oh.

23:21.794 --> 23:23.160
Mm.

23:24.163 --> 23:26.997
I'm going to be waiting on P3,

23:26.999 --> 23:30.667
parked across from the
exit in a silver car.

23:30.669 --> 23:33.370
You got 15 minutes.

23:33.372 --> 23:35.906
15 minutes, baby. Hmm?

23:35.908 --> 23:38.909
There's always room for one more

23:38.911 --> 23:40.310
if you want to join us.

23:40.312 --> 23:44.281
I'd love to have you.

23:44.283 --> 23:45.716
Hey, Miss Carlotta.

23:45.718 --> 23:49.820
You looking good today.

23:55.227 --> 23:56.693
What happened?

23:56.695 --> 23:58.996
Did he hurt you?

23:58.998 --> 24:00.697
I've got it under control.

24:00.699 --> 24:03.200
What'd he do to you?

24:03.202 --> 24:05.168
Simone was right.

24:05.170 --> 24:06.970
That man was in my house this morning.

24:06.972 --> 24:08.138
Who is he?

24:08.140 --> 24:11.174
That's Otis, her foster father.

24:11.176 --> 24:12.409
He came back for her.

24:12.411 --> 24:14.778
- Where's Simone?
- She's with Alexandra.

24:14.780 --> 24:16.613
Okay, I'm calling the cops.

24:16.615 --> 24:18.248
No, no, no, no, no. Carlotta, you can't.

24:18.250 --> 24:21.118
You-You can't. We can't...

24:21.120 --> 24:22.536
We can't call the cops.

24:23.485 --> 24:24.885
Okay.

24:29.746 --> 24:34.231
You need to tell me what happened.

24:34.233 --> 24:36.918
You need to tell me everything.

24:40.156 --> 24:42.873
When I finally found Simone,

24:42.875 --> 24:44.675
he was on top of her,

24:44.677 --> 24:46.777
raping her.

24:46.779 --> 24:49.212
So I stabbed him, and
I kept stabbing him

24:49.214 --> 24:53.216
and I tried to kill him.

24:53.218 --> 24:54.618
So, if you call the cops,

24:54.620 --> 24:56.437
Simone's going back
and I'm going to jail.

24:59.180 --> 25:01.280
That's the whole story.

25:10.787 --> 25:14.905
I won't let that happen.

25:14.907 --> 25:17.825
And I damn sure ain't letting
him get away with this.

25:24.167 --> 25:26.016
Go home.

25:26.018 --> 25:27.751
I'll handle it.

25:27.753 --> 25:31.706
I need you to come up and meet
me on the second floor now.

25:36.797 --> 25:38.362
Where's my gun?

25:40.649 --> 25:42.216
Bitch.

25:47.706 --> 25:52.126
You did a really good job up there.

25:53.129 --> 25:54.562
Have a good night.

26:12.048 --> 26:14.448
Ooh, excuse me.

26:16.135 --> 26:18.007
What's going on? What's the emergency?

26:18.009 --> 26:19.836
- The gun is missing.
- The gun?

26:19.838 --> 26:21.877
- What do you need a gun for?
- Simone's foster father is here.

26:21.879 --> 26:23.373
He been raping that girl for years.

26:23.375 --> 26:25.526
That's why they ran away.

26:26.462 --> 26:27.844
Let's go handle business.

26:27.846 --> 26:29.964
Okay.

26:45.369 --> 26:47.636
Otis!

26:51.709 --> 26:53.191
Hey, baby.

26:53.193 --> 26:55.544
I ain't your baby!

26:58.048 --> 27:01.799
I missed you.

27:01.801 --> 27:04.502
Don't even flinch.

27:04.504 --> 27:07.071
Come on now. You're not happy to see me?

27:07.073 --> 27:10.208
Not even just a little bit?

27:10.210 --> 27:12.643
Huh?

27:12.645 --> 27:14.996
Oh.

27:16.567 --> 27:20.084
You know you're still
daddy's little girl.

27:20.086 --> 27:21.753
Put the gun down.

27:21.755 --> 27:24.388
I ain't going anywhere with you.

27:24.390 --> 27:26.657
You hurt me!

27:26.659 --> 27:28.343
All right.

27:31.515 --> 27:35.800
Something you need to know, though.

27:35.802 --> 27:37.435
No matter where you run,

27:37.437 --> 27:39.837
how far you go, where you hide,

27:41.141 --> 27:43.959
I'm gonna always find you.

27:45.229 --> 27:51.433
Because you belong to me, Simone.

29:10.414 --> 29:12.496
Hey, slow down.

29:12.498 --> 29:14.265
- Where you been?
- Don't worry about it.

29:14.267 --> 29:15.533
I got to go.

29:15.535 --> 29:17.185
We got finals still, so...

29:18.889 --> 29:21.939
Guess I'll call you tomorrow.

29:24.565 --> 29:27.545
Please give a round of
applause for Keena 360.

29:27.547 --> 29:29.247
She's paved the way for so...

29:29.249 --> 29:32.116
...for so many artists
that you see here today.

29:32.118 --> 29:33.618
What happened to you?

29:33.620 --> 29:35.686
Simone. Where is she?

29:35.688 --> 29:37.421
She ran off.

29:37.423 --> 29:39.323
We need to find her. She needs us.

29:39.325 --> 29:41.659
I've looked for that girl
everywhere. She's not here.

29:41.661 --> 29:43.794
- Did you call her?
- Yeah, a million times.

29:43.796 --> 29:45.196
Keeps going straight to voice mail.

29:45.198 --> 29:46.430
Yeah.

29:46.432 --> 29:48.099
I knew this would happen.

29:48.101 --> 29:50.101
I knew she would do something like this.

29:50.103 --> 29:51.569
I've been trying to protect her.

29:51.571 --> 29:53.638
We're gonna find her, all right?

29:53.640 --> 29:57.141
We need to, fast, because she's crazy.

29:57.143 --> 30:02.079
And we got to find her before
she does something crazy.

30:02.081 --> 30:03.948
Which one of you has my gun?

30:03.950 --> 30:05.283
What are you talking about?

30:05.285 --> 30:06.951
My gun is missing.

30:06.953 --> 30:09.754
Simone.

30:09.756 --> 30:11.307
What about Otis?

30:11.332 --> 30:13.316
- Otis is dead.
- He's dead.

30:15.479 --> 30:17.161
All right, what's going on?

30:17.163 --> 30:19.281
It's being handled.

30:40.597 --> 30:42.795
Cotton and Alexandra are
checking for her in the back.

30:42.820 --> 30:44.286
Yeah, I pray they find her.

30:44.311 --> 30:46.434
Pray? We need to find her right now.

30:46.436 --> 30:49.420
We both know what'll
happen if she's left alone.

31:08.759 --> 31:10.225
Otis.

31:11.495 --> 31:14.029
Call the girls and tell them we got her.

31:24.765 --> 31:27.082
Hello. It's me.

31:27.084 --> 31:28.650
We found her.

31:28.652 --> 31:31.119
Carlotta wants y'all to come back.

31:32.622 --> 31:35.657
Boy, you done been through
more in your 16 years

31:35.659 --> 31:38.326
than most people have in their lifetime.

31:38.328 --> 31:40.779
But listen to me.

31:43.467 --> 31:47.268
That chapter of your life is over.

31:47.270 --> 31:48.988
You understand?

31:54.161 --> 31:56.362
Could we have a minute?

32:09.143 --> 32:10.658
Simone,

32:10.660 --> 32:12.794
let me tell you something.

32:12.796 --> 32:15.897
The smell of his cologne,

32:15.899 --> 32:18.233
the sound of his voice,

32:18.235 --> 32:20.402
the feeling...

32:20.404 --> 32:24.305
of his nasty hands on your body...

32:24.307 --> 32:27.242
Those memories are going to fade.

32:27.244 --> 32:29.544
Okay? They will fade.

32:29.546 --> 32:32.113
But you need to find
something to focus on.

32:32.115 --> 32:33.648
That's how that works.

32:33.650 --> 32:35.200
All right?

32:37.104 --> 32:39.087
Now, I know you don't
care about all of this.

32:39.089 --> 32:41.823
But look at where we are.

32:41.825 --> 32:44.143
Look at how far we've come.

32:46.047 --> 32:48.596
Hold onto that, okay?

32:48.598 --> 32:50.982
I can. Okay.

32:50.984 --> 32:52.434
And now,

32:52.436 --> 32:54.936
the moment we've all been waiting for,

32:54.938 --> 32:58.840
first place winner of this
year's Taylor Brothers Hair Show

32:58.842 --> 33:00.241
goes to...

33:01.478 --> 33:04.195
God's Blessings Beauty Salon!

33:05.282 --> 33:06.698
Yes!

33:06.700 --> 33:08.516
Get it, girl!

33:08.518 --> 33:10.785
There's an encore performance coming up.

33:10.787 --> 33:12.353
God's Blessings won.

33:12.355 --> 33:13.639
Let's go.

33:14.809 --> 33:16.408
Come on.

33:20.393 --> 33:22.493
We're gonna be strong.

33:24.852 --> 33:26.101
These are done for.

33:26.103 --> 33:27.335
I've been meaning to fix 'em.

33:27.337 --> 33:31.005
Yeah, we will. Come on.

33:36.297 --> 33:37.412
Yes!

33:37.414 --> 33:40.048
Congratulations.

33:40.050 --> 33:41.149
Bitches.

33:41.151 --> 33:43.184
Get it, girl.

33:43.186 --> 33:44.652
There's a lot of people out there,

33:44.654 --> 33:46.721
there's cameras everywhere.

33:46.723 --> 33:48.974
Y'all need to get up on that stage.

33:51.908 --> 33:54.075
It's called an alibi.

33:55.683 --> 33:57.999
And we don't talk about this.

33:58.001 --> 34:00.401
You understand?

34:00.403 --> 34:02.337
And we have something coming up for you.

34:02.339 --> 34:04.305
Not ever.

34:04.307 --> 34:06.274
We have another surprise,
an encore performance.

34:06.276 --> 34:07.542
Now...

34:07.544 --> 34:10.963
sparkle, Neely, sparkle.

34:15.485 --> 34:19.521

36:54.599 --> 36:56.515
Hi.

36:56.517 --> 36:58.116
Where you gonna put it?

36:58.118 --> 36:59.985
I don't know, I want
to put it in my house,

36:59.987 --> 37:02.254
but you know Carlotta
ain't gonna go for that.

37:02.256 --> 37:05.424
Ms. Gladys, thank you so
much for doing this for us.

37:05.426 --> 37:08.494
Now you know I loved
it. Call me anytime.

37:08.496 --> 37:10.696
And that niece of yours.

37:10.698 --> 37:11.869
She all right when she want to be.

37:11.871 --> 37:12.881
I love her.

37:12.883 --> 37:14.266
Thank you, Auntie.

37:14.268 --> 37:15.639
Why you always got to
be starting something?

37:15.641 --> 37:18.136
You better be glad Ms.
Knight's sitting right here.

37:21.559 --> 37:22.925
Is he always like that?

37:22.927 --> 37:25.511
Unfortunately, yes.

38:30.644 --> 38:32.562
You don't have to do that.

38:59.057 --> 39:04.142
I heard rumblings that the
transaction never went through.

39:04.144 --> 39:05.595
Something's not right.

39:07.799 --> 39:10.082
Yeah, well, this never happens.

39:10.084 --> 39:12.084
There were four other
exchanges that night,

39:12.086 --> 39:14.286
and every single one of them
went off without a hitch.

39:14.288 --> 39:16.372
To be honest, I think he's lying.

39:19.143 --> 39:21.159
I'll keep an eye on him.

39:21.161 --> 39:23.428
If Jahil's up to something,

39:23.430 --> 39:25.781
it's only a matter of
time before he slips up.

39:39.158 --> 39:40.846
So what are we supposed to do?

39:40.848 --> 39:42.481
Hmm?

39:42.483 --> 39:44.116
Just act like nothing ever happened?

39:44.118 --> 39:46.617
That's exactly what you gonna do.

39:46.642 --> 39:49.334
You girls been looking over your
shoulders since you got here.

39:49.359 --> 39:50.622
It's over now.

39:50.624 --> 39:52.858
I don't know about y'all,
but it's been a long day.

39:52.860 --> 39:54.126
I'm going to bed.

39:54.128 --> 39:55.661
Yeah, me, too.

39:55.663 --> 39:58.063
I didn't do it.

39:58.065 --> 39:59.798
I didn't kill Otis.

39:59.800 --> 40:01.033
What?

40:01.035 --> 40:02.501
Simone...

40:02.503 --> 40:04.153
That's enough.

40:05.657 --> 40:07.139
We know what happened.

40:07.141 --> 40:08.591
Star, like, ease up off her.

40:09.794 --> 40:12.044
You saw her, she had Carlotta's gun.

40:12.046 --> 40:14.312
I wanted to kill him.

40:14.314 --> 40:16.298
I just couldn't pull the trigger.

40:17.235 --> 40:19.117
I'm so confused.

40:19.119 --> 40:21.987
Simone, we're the last
people you need to lie to.

40:21.989 --> 40:23.288
We will protect you.

40:23.290 --> 40:25.624
I didn't kill Otis!

40:25.626 --> 40:27.192
I don't think I believe you.

40:27.194 --> 40:29.278
I didn't!

40:31.149 --> 40:32.564
All right,

40:32.566 --> 40:35.033
okay.

40:35.035 --> 40:39.321
Well, if Simone didn't
kill him, then who did?

Sometimes it all comes
down to what you don't say.

41:02.996 --> 41:07.332
That night, we all agreed:
the devil is gone...

41:07.334 --> 41:08.633
for now.
