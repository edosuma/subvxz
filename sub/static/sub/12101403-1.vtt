Yes, yes, they're great.

01:34.484 --> 01:35.819
It's they're just... it's a lot,
you know?

01:35.852 --> 01:36.521
What about you?

01:36.554 --> 01:37.822
- Are you having fun?
- Yeah.

01:37.855 --> 01:39.423
Don't tell her,

01:39.456 --> 01:42.326
but I'm actually kind of glad
KJ put this together.

01:42.358 --> 01:44.728
Yea, I know you're like
the little lesbian child bride

01:44.762 --> 01:45.195

01:50.034 --> 01:51.736
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:51.769 --> 01:53.904
Excuse me.

01:53.936 --> 01:57.674
In this country, we don't drink
when we are pregnant.

02:02.412 --> 02:04.314
Uh, mm, mm.

02:04.347 --> 02:07.385
Okay, um, she says she's
actually sacrificing this one,

02:07.418 --> 02:09.020
so it doesn't matter.

02:09.051 --> 02:10.655
Thank you for your concern.

02:12.355 --> 02:13.156
Noor.

02:13.991 --> 02:14.625
Come.

02:14.657 --> 02:15.725
Ooh!

02:15.758 --> 02:16.993
You're uh,
you're being beckoned back

02:17.026 --> 02:18.328
to the daughters
of Isabella over there.

02:18.361 --> 02:20.397
- Okay, you coming back over?
- Yes.

02:20.431 --> 02:22.033
Yes, I just need a break
from Joshlyn's mom.

02:22.766 --> 02:23.800
It's actually Ashlyn and Jayden.

02:23.834 --> 02:25.069
Oh my God.

02:25.102 --> 02:25.703
Okay.

02:28.104 --> 02:28.638
Uh.

02:28.671 --> 02:29.472
- Ew, George.
- Hey.

02:29.507 --> 02:30.841
Why are you wearing
this sweatshirt?

02:30.873 --> 02:32.475
Ashton gave it to me.

02:32.508 --> 02:33.843
We're writing little messages
on the diapers,

02:33.877 --> 02:34.512
so the baby feels supported...

02:34.544 --> 02:35.178
Ah!

02:35.212 --> 02:36.313
When it shits or something.

02:36.347 --> 02:40.084
I wrote the littlest feet
leave the biggest footprints

02:40.116 --> 02:41.451
in our hearts.

02:41.485 --> 02:42.753
- Oh.
- Oh, wow.

02:42.786 --> 02:43.653
- Oh.
- It's cute.

02:43.687 --> 02:44.154
Thank you.

02:44.187 --> 02:45.389
I found it online.

02:47.890 --> 02:50.527
Wait, who's Jeff Lanskey?

02:52.562 --> 02:53.830
That's amazing.

02:53.864 --> 02:55.399
It's just um,
just an inside joke

02:55.431 --> 02:57.334
from middle school.

02:58.769 --> 03:01.872
Oh, he was this um,
kid who was obsessed

03:01.905 --> 03:04.008
with Captain Underpants
in seventh grade

03:04.040 --> 03:05.876
and he wore a diaper
over his pants,

03:05.908 --> 03:07.377
but then the teachers
made him stop,

03:07.411 --> 03:08.746
because he was
getting made fun of,

03:08.778 --> 03:10.747
but it was still
like really clear

03:10.781 --> 03:13.450
he was wearing a diaper
under his pants.

03:13.484 --> 03:15.419
And Noor used to call him
"petty officer underpants",

03:15.451 --> 03:16.620
because he wasn't
high-ranking enough.

03:17.086 --> 03:17.954
That is true.

03:18.688 --> 03:19.789
Wow, that's amazin.

03:19.823 --> 03:21.859
Now it's like I'm in the joke.

03:23.159 --> 03:25.628
And I got suspended for that,

03:25.662 --> 03:27.397
but Milo hooked up
with our chem teacher

03:27.431 --> 03:29.133
the night after
high school graduation

03:29.165 --> 03:30.633
and that was all good.

03:30.667 --> 03:33.104
Yeah, girl,
Mr. Rashkoff was fine as hell.

03:33.137 --> 03:34.872
Oh.

03:34.905 --> 03:36.140
He was such a hot commodity,
he had to hook up with her.

03:36.173 --> 03:36.806
- Ooh.
- Oh.

03:37.807 --> 03:41.544
Well, okay uh,
tell us how you really feel.

03:41.578 --> 03:43.681
Not you, I just...

03:43.713 --> 03:47.585
I mean like there's a reason
why certain men

03:47.617 --> 03:50.153
can't get people over the age
of 18 to fuck them, right?

03:50.888 --> 03:52.556
Yes!

03:52.588 --> 03:54.091
Okay,
I think I'm gonna head out.

03:54.123 --> 03:54.691
Yeah?

03:55.893 --> 03:57.395
Yeah.

03:57.427 --> 03:58.628
- Seriously?
- Yes.

03:58.662 --> 03:59.697
I was just kidding.

03:59.729 --> 04:00.430
No, I know.

04:00.463 --> 04:01.865
I'm just tired I wanna go home.

04:01.899 --> 04:02.967
You know what you need?

04:03.000 --> 04:04.068
Neutrofirm.

04:04.100 --> 04:05.068
Sorry?

04:05.102 --> 04:06.971
Neutrofirm, it's this amazing

04:07.003 --> 04:08.705
multi-level
marketing lifestyle brand

04:08.739 --> 04:11.575
that can actually give you
like so much energy.

04:11.608 --> 04:14.010
My college roommate,
her brother committed suicide.

04:14.044 --> 04:15.780
I know, so sad.

04:15.812 --> 04:18.481
And I swear to God,
it stopped her

04:18.514 --> 04:20.750
from getting
like depressed or whatever.

04:20.783 --> 04:21.752
It's great for her skin.

04:25.689 --> 04:26.490
Pool!

04:28.524 --> 04:30.527
That sucked.

04:30.560 --> 04:32.128
Are we assholes
for leaving early?

04:32.161 --> 04:34.731
I was getting pretty tapped out
of pin the fetus on the uterus.

04:34.764 --> 04:36.132
I know.

04:36.165 --> 04:39.036
I always feel so aggressively
like single and young

04:39.069 --> 04:40.137
when I'm with Noor's
college friends.

04:40.170 --> 04:43.107
I'm not like single and young
you know, like ugh,

04:43.139 --> 04:44.574
oldest cousin sitting at
the kids' table

04:44.608 --> 04:46.644
of Thanksgiving single
and young.

04:46.677 --> 04:48.679
Milo, I have full confidence
you'll find some man

04:48.711 --> 04:50.613
to intellectually intimidate
and emotionally torture

04:50.646 --> 04:52.983
until you can buy a brownstone,
get divorced,

04:53.016 --> 04:54.585
and live happily ever after.

04:54.617 --> 04:57.487
Ooh, is that truly
so much to ask of me?

04:57.521 --> 04:58.556
Um, sorry.

04:58.588 --> 04:59.689
Could you uh, watch my stuff?

04:59.723 --> 05:00.925
I have to make a phone call.

05:00.958 --> 05:02.893
Yeah, sure.

05:02.925 --> 05:03.693
Shit, fuck.

05:03.726 --> 05:05.028

05:05.062 --> 05:06.497
No, this Tinder boy

05:06.529 --> 05:08.998
for finally texted me back
to hang out.

05:09.031 --> 05:10.733
It's like 11:00, dude.

05:10.766 --> 05:12.101
Yeah, I mean
I don't think he's tryin'

05:12.134 --> 05:13.937
to catch
the New York Philharmonic.

05:13.971 --> 05:15.840
Are you gonna go meet him?

05:15.872 --> 05:17.173

I don't have to.

Really?

05:23.079 --> 05:24.247
Yeah.

05:24.281 --> 05:24.814
I mean I've
already lost one best friend

05:24.848 --> 05:25.516

Oh my God, George,

05:30.920 --> 05:34.557
Sorry, he's just
right around the corner.

05:34.591 --> 05:36.026
- I can wait, though.
- No, it's fine.

05:36.059 --> 05:36.994
Honestly,
I'm just gonna head home

05:37.026 --> 05:38.562
if this guy ever comes back

05:40.129 --> 05:41.531

Hello?

06:12.596 --> 06:14.899
Some um,
masked vigilantes came in

06:14.932 --> 06:15.800
and tried to steal your stuff,

06:31.848 --> 06:33.016
Yeah, sure, go for it.

06:33.050 --> 06:35.052
So uh, my bar manager

06:35.084 --> 06:36.986
downloaded this dating app
for me.

06:37.019 --> 06:39.622
Oh no, friends don't let friends
swipe right for them.

06:39.656 --> 06:41.057

and we're supposed
to have our first date tonight,

06:45.995 --> 06:47.697
he just totally blew me off.

06:47.730 --> 06:49.132
Huh, can I see your messages?

06:52.603 --> 06:56.139
Okay, okay, okay, flirty good.

06:56.173 --> 06:57.975
Yeah, no, he never confirmed.

06:58.007 --> 07:00.877
- He totally did.
- Mm-mm, where?

07:00.911 --> 07:02.913
"Can I take you out to dinner?"
I said.

07:02.946 --> 07:03.581
He said, "I don't know.

07:03.613 --> 07:04.048
Can you?"

07:04.081 --> 07:05.682
I said, "Ha-ha.

07:05.716 --> 07:06.850
How about drinks
and a late movie?"

07:06.884 --> 07:09.586
He says, "I've seen a lot
of what's out there right now,

07:09.620 --> 07:10.887
but maybe drinks."

07:10.920 --> 07:12.956
And I go, "Okay,
let's start at Phoenix,

07:12.990 --> 07:13.790
10:00 p.m., Thursday

07:13.824 --> 07:16.093
and see where the night
takes us."

07:17.124 --> 07:17.995
Yeah, and he responded?

07:20.930 --> 07:22.231
Oh.

07:22.264 --> 07:24.233
I'm... come on, that's so rude!

07:25.302 --> 07:26.770
He's a grown adult
on a dating app.

07:26.802 --> 07:28.805
He can't have the decency
to at least lie to me?

07:30.273 --> 07:31.842
Oh, fine.

07:31.875 --> 07:33.776
I'll just be single
till I'm dead.

07:33.810 --> 07:35.713
What about after you're dead?

07:35.745 --> 07:37.380
Freddie Mercury
is waiting for me in heaven.

07:39.850 --> 07:41.352
Okay,
I have a confession for you

07:41.384 --> 07:44.288
and it is that I am
like really bad at sports,

07:44.321 --> 07:47.791
but kind of one of those people
who's like weirdly a savant

07:47.824 --> 07:49.093
the first time
they play a sport.

07:50.124 --> 07:50.727
Like I bowled at 250

07:50.761 --> 07:52.229
the first time I went bowling
in the seventh grade

07:52.262 --> 07:54.031
and then that never
happened again.

07:56.233 --> 07:58.369
So this isn't the first time
you play darts.

07:59.101 --> 08:00.770
Exactly.

08:00.803 --> 08:02.872
So why are you here instead of

08:02.906 --> 08:05.776
at your friend's baby shower?

08:08.011 --> 08:10.347
So the last time I hung out
with her sorority friends,

08:10.379 --> 08:11.882
I like convinced one of them

08:11.915 --> 08:14.184
that if you don't eat gluten
when you're pregnant,

08:14.216 --> 08:15.853
then your baby definitely
won't come out gay,

08:15.886 --> 08:17.888
and I actually sat there,
and watched her grapple

08:17.920 --> 08:19.389
with the moral implications
of that for like three hours.

08:20.156 --> 08:21.959
I just feel like, "Ugh."

08:21.992 --> 08:23.293
When I spend too much time
with them,

08:23.326 --> 08:24.927
I end up like feeling

08:24.961 --> 08:26.864
like maybe I'm the one
who's missing out on something

08:26.896 --> 08:28.766
and then that just
makes me feel even crazier.

08:28.798 --> 08:34.102
I... they all just seem
like very content, you know?

08:34.135 --> 08:36.139
I've read some
crazy percentage of people

08:36.173 --> 08:37.841
who haven't had
a serious relationship

08:37.874 --> 08:40.376
by the time they're 30,
never have one.

08:40.409 --> 08:41.010
Wow.

08:41.043 --> 08:41.510
Thank you.

08:41.544 --> 08:42.879
Thank you so much.

08:42.913 --> 08:44.748
I feel like my eggs
just like dunkirked

08:44.780 --> 08:45.381
right up into my body.

08:46.750 --> 08:48.052
When I was in my 20s,

08:48.085 --> 08:49.853
I at least asked people

08:49.885 --> 08:51.387
what side of the bed
they prefer to sleep on,

08:51.421 --> 08:51.988
but now?

08:52.022 --> 08:52.956
There is no fuckin' way

08:52.989 --> 08:54.758
I'm sleepin'
on the right side of the bed.

08:54.791 --> 08:55.559
Well, there goes the whole

08:55.591 --> 08:56.427
left-side-of-the-bed
contingency.

08:58.160 --> 09:01.030
So what do you do do
when you're not very busy

09:01.063 --> 09:02.765
being stood up by flaky men?

09:02.798 --> 09:04.400
Ever been to Thigh High?

09:04.433 --> 09:05.468
Yes, the gay bar?

09:05.501 --> 09:06.703
That's my bar.

09:06.736 --> 09:07.904
No way.

09:07.937 --> 09:09.872
Yeah, and I actually perform
in our show

09:09.905 --> 09:11.174
every other Thursday night.

09:11.207 --> 09:13.276
Okay, my roommate George
got kicked out of that bar

09:13.309 --> 09:14.711
when we were freshman
in college.

09:14.745 --> 09:16.480
Send him
my personal condolences.

09:16.513 --> 09:18.148
He ordered whatever whiskey
you had on draft

09:18.181 --> 09:19.014
and then he stole

09:19.048 --> 09:19.882
your cardboard cutout
of George Takei,

09:19.916 --> 09:22.319
so I don't think
he holds it against you.

09:22.351 --> 09:23.920
I wondered where that went.

09:23.953 --> 09:25.155
Oh, well, he's very well
taking care of it, don't worry.

09:30.927 --> 09:32.162
So what about you?

09:32.195 --> 09:33.764
You single?

09:33.797 --> 09:36.399
Uh, are you asking for yourself
or for a friend?

09:38.835 --> 09:40.237
Yeah, almost always.

09:40.269 --> 09:42.072
I'm really looking forward
to being an eccentric aunt.

09:42.105 --> 09:42.505
What about you?

09:42.538 --> 09:44.073
Any um...

09:45.307 --> 09:46.943
Ex-husbands
or like illegitimate children

09:46.976 --> 09:47.910
floating around out there?

09:47.943 --> 09:49.913
No.

09:49.946 --> 09:52.115
Single gay man, early 50s,

09:52.149 --> 09:54.083
it doesn't paint a particularly
competitive picture

09:54.116 --> 09:56.252
at adoption agencies.

09:56.285 --> 09:58.821
I feel like um,
I actually read this article

09:58.855 --> 10:00.990
about adoption agencies
that cater specifically

10:01.024 --> 10:01.991
to gay men.

10:02.024 --> 10:03.126
Yeah.

10:05.162 --> 10:07.898
I've lost three kids.

10:07.931 --> 10:11.402
Two adoptions fell through
and one surrogacy didn't take.

10:14.538 --> 10:15.404
I'm really sorry.

10:15.437 --> 10:18.307
That... it sucks.

10:18.341 --> 10:19.009
Pfft.

10:19.042 --> 10:20.076
Sorry to get so heavy on you.

10:20.110 --> 10:21.278
No, it's okay.

10:21.311 --> 10:22.812
Honestly, in my opinion,
it is like...

10:22.846 --> 10:23.880
It is like not a New York moment

10:23.913 --> 10:24.981
unless you talk
about your fetish

10:25.014 --> 10:25.414
or your dead parents.

10:31.288 --> 10:32.889
You're done trying?

10:32.923 --> 10:34.892
I don't know.

10:34.924 --> 10:37.059
I don't think I can
go through it again emotionally.

10:37.092 --> 10:38.161
Hmm.

10:38.195 --> 10:40.063
It makes it easier to just think

10:40.096 --> 10:41.899
it wasn't in the cards
sometimes.

10:51.006 --> 10:53.543
How does someone even
become a surrogate?

10:53.576 --> 10:55.178
Oh.

10:55.211 --> 10:59.048
Uh, you go through an agency,
but often it's a friend,

10:59.081 --> 11:01.150
sibling, charismatic drifter.

11:01.183 --> 11:02.552

You asking?

11:09.225 --> 11:10.827
What?

11:10.860 --> 11:12.461
No, I'm just uh, I wasn't tryin'
to imply that at all.

11:12.495 --> 11:14.063
I'm sorry, I'm drunk.

11:14.096 --> 11:16.399
I'm just... I was not tryin'
to be leading in any way.

11:16.432 --> 11:17.533
It's fine.

11:17.567 --> 11:18.501

I didn't think you were.

- Sorry.

13:20.289 --> 13:20.723
No, it's okay.

13:22.359 --> 13:25.095
Um, wow, you caught me um,
fondling the merchandise.

13:25.128 --> 13:26.129
Is that a Taylor?

13:26.163 --> 13:29.099
Yes, I am pretty sure
it's the love of my life.

13:29.131 --> 13:30.666
Hmm, I'm more of a Cushing man.

13:30.700 --> 13:31.301

13:36.239 --> 13:38.041
Why do you like the Taylor
so much?

13:38.073 --> 13:40.710
Oh, um, I don't know.

13:40.744 --> 13:42.512
I think their lower mids
are richer,

13:42.544 --> 13:44.246
the action on the hands
tends to be a little easier

13:44.279 --> 13:47.016
than the Cushing, too.

13:47.049 --> 13:48.184
I like a guitar

13:48.217 --> 13:49.652
that makes you work
for it a little bit.

13:51.388 --> 13:52.723
A lot of instruments
sound beautiful,

13:52.755 --> 13:56.158
but there's nothin'
like finding one

13:56.192 --> 13:58.394
that plays right just for you,

13:58.427 --> 14:01.230
somethin' no one else can seem
to figure out the same way.

14:04.701 --> 14:05.634
You're right, though.

14:05.668 --> 14:07.336
This Taylor is pretty sweet.

14:07.370 --> 14:11.240
Uh, so are you lookin'
for anything in particular?

14:11.274 --> 14:12.743
I'll try to be impartial.

14:12.775 --> 14:15.245
Yeah,

17:50.859 --> 17:51.394
No.

17:51.426 --> 17:52.661
No, no, no, it's okay.

17:52.694 --> 17:54.263
I can chill here.

17:54.297 --> 17:56.633
Um, how long do you think
it'll take you to get ready?

17:56.665 --> 17:58.534
I'm so sorry, Mi,

17:58.567 --> 18:00.670
I think I should
probably just call it a night.

18:00.702 --> 18:01.304
Ugh, are you sure?

18:01.336 --> 18:02.204
Listen, I can come to you,

18:02.238 --> 18:04.975
we can have a really unfun night
together.

18:05.008 --> 18:06.442
Let's find a time next week.

18:08.778 --> 18:09.546
Okay.

18:09.578 --> 18:10.279
I love you.

18:10.313 --> 18:12.315
I know I'm the worst right now.

18:12.347 --> 18:14.250
Yeah, okay, bye.

21:57.874 --> 22:00.610
Okay, never have I ever shown up
at a stranger's drag show.

22:00.643 --> 22:01.877
Hmm?

22:01.911 --> 22:03.712
Would we call me a "stranger"?

22:03.746 --> 22:05.181
Oh, I forgot about
all those fun Thanksgivings

22:05.213 --> 22:06.615
we spent together.

22:06.648 --> 22:08.250
Don't you just hate how Aunt Pam
is always tryin'

22:08.284 --> 22:09.752
to get you to join Amway.

22:09.785 --> 22:11.653
I feel like once you talk
about having a baby

22:11.686 --> 22:12.788
with a stranger,

22:12.821 --> 22:15.224
you're acquaintances
at the very least.

22:15.258 --> 22:17.727
Like yeah,
as the old Irish saying goes...

22:17.759 --> 22:20.230
I am so embarrassed.

22:20.262 --> 22:21.230
Did I say something stupid?

22:21.263 --> 22:23.699
I just... I keep thinking
about it and cringing.

22:23.732 --> 22:24.834
Why?

22:24.866 --> 22:26.201
Because I was so drunk.

22:26.234 --> 22:28.971
I don't want some random girl
thinking I was tryin'

22:29.005 --> 22:30.707
to solicit her
into some arrangement.

22:33.142 --> 22:38.681
Um, you know I have
kind of been considering it.

22:38.713 --> 22:40.549
considering what?

22:40.583 --> 22:44.019
Well, I do declare,
Mr. Anglo American,

22:44.053 --> 22:46.022
I'm but a spinsterly old maid
who has yet

22:46.055 --> 22:49.659
to use these plentiful hips
for a single babe.

22:52.327 --> 22:54.163
Are you serious?

22:55.163 --> 22:55.597
Yeah.

22:55.631 --> 22:56.566
Yeah, I mean yes.

22:56.598 --> 22:57.634
I wouldn't...

22:57.666 --> 22:59.903
I wouldn't bring it up
if I wasn't.

22:59.935 --> 23:02.704
Milo, we hardly know each other.

23:02.738 --> 23:03.840
Well, you know me better
than some stranger

23:03.873 --> 23:04.908
from an agency.

23:04.941 --> 23:08.044
Yeah, I... uh...

23:08.076 --> 23:09.846
And I know you mean well.

23:09.878 --> 23:10.779
You don't understand
what it's like

23:10.814 --> 23:13.048
to go through this over
and over again.

23:13.082 --> 23:15.552
Okay, well, I... I like...

23:15.585 --> 23:16.952
Ugh.

23:16.986 --> 23:18.955
I don't even believe in fate
or whatever, but it is...

23:18.988 --> 23:20.957
it is like really weird
how we met

23:20.990 --> 23:23.026
and it just seems right,
you know?

23:23.058 --> 23:25.827
Like the kismet we share
or something

23:25.861 --> 23:27.664
and I just think
it's really unfair

23:27.696 --> 23:29.631
that there are so many
shitty parents in the world,

23:29.664 --> 23:32.335
and you wanna be a dad,
and you don't get to be one.

23:32.367 --> 23:36.306
I don't know that I'm supposed
to be a dad, Milo.

23:36.338 --> 23:40.042
I feel like maybe just
falling through so many times

23:40.076 --> 23:42.711
is the universe's way
of telling me "no".

23:42.744 --> 23:45.280
I feel like you can force
any random fucking moment or...

23:45.314 --> 23:48.284
Or interaction into any hole
and say that it fits.

23:48.317 --> 23:49.719
Like it didn't work out
the first three times,

23:49.751 --> 23:51.153
the universe is saying "no",

23:51.186 --> 23:52.955
you need some random chick
in a bar who wants to help,

23:52.989 --> 23:54.891
the universe is saying "yes".

23:54.923 --> 23:56.725
The universe is just a bunch
of random bullshit

23:56.759 --> 23:58.193
floating around in the ether,

23:58.227 --> 24:00.063
and we're all just picking
and choosing which pieces of it

24:00.096 --> 24:01.698
to give meaning to.

24:01.730 --> 24:03.666
Has that been embroidered
on a throw pillow yet?

24:06.969 --> 24:11.307
Roger, I... I really feel
like uh, I can do something

24:11.339 --> 24:12.641
that is bigger than myself.

24:15.111 --> 24:16.646
Okay.

24:16.679 --> 24:18.314
This is really truly
an amazing offer

24:18.346 --> 24:20.650
you've been making
and a part of me,

24:20.682 --> 24:23.685
a big part of me,
wants to say "yes" right now

24:23.719 --> 24:26.956
before the... the sun comes up
and you change your mind,

24:26.989 --> 24:31.394
but this is
not a tequila drag decision.

24:31.426 --> 24:33.395
I need...

24:33.429 --> 24:34.864
Can we think about it?

24:39.868 --> 24:41.303
Ow, fuck!

24:43.739 --> 24:45.307
You can take
all the time you need, okay,

24:45.340 --> 24:47.142
but I... I am not backing out.

25:07.896 --> 25:09.264
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

25:09.298 --> 25:09.999
Hey.

25:10.031 --> 25:11.400
Hey, hold this for me a second.

25:11.433 --> 25:12.434
Hmm.

25:12.468 --> 25:14.370
What does she have up her
sleeve?

25:15.070 --> 25:17.039
Oh my God, you are amazing.

25:17.073 --> 25:17.974
You are literally God's gift.

25:18.007 --> 25:18.641
Hmm.

25:18.674 --> 25:19.675
When did you even get this?

25:19.709 --> 25:22.111
Oh, the second,
I heard we were spending the day

25:22.144 --> 25:23.445
at a fuckin' pumpkin patch.

25:23.479 --> 25:24.980
God bless you.

25:25.013 --> 25:26.682
- Okay, salud, my baby.
- Yeah.

25:26.715 --> 25:28.417
Wait, wait, wait,
I want a pic.

25:28.451 --> 25:30.987
Alright, say is a...
is a gourd technically a fruit?

25:31.019 --> 25:32.254
No,
I think it's a root vegetable.

25:32.288 --> 25:33.389
- Ooh. Ooh, Milo.
- Mm.

25:33.422 --> 25:34.089
- Oh, really?
- Mm.

25:34.123 --> 25:34.990
- Milo.
- Oh, fuck.

25:35.023 --> 25:38.226
Will you get...
will you get one of us?

25:38.259 --> 25:38.961
Uh, yeah, sure.

25:38.993 --> 25:40.829
I don't know like... are you in?

25:40.863 --> 25:41.764
- Yes, yeah.
- Alright.

25:41.797 --> 25:42.964
Okay, here we go.

25:42.998 --> 25:43.966
- What are you doing?
- I'm smilin'.

25:43.999 --> 25:45.434
- What are you doing?
- Hey, got it.

25:45.468 --> 25:46.035
Is it cute?

25:46.068 --> 25:47.836
Yeah, it's... it's good.

25:47.869 --> 25:49.971
Oh, Milo, will you, um,
you actually get another one

25:50.005 --> 25:51.474
with like a belly
pumpkin photo...

25:51.507 --> 25:52.808
for my parents, you know?

25:52.842 --> 25:54.144
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah.

25:58.881 --> 26:01.050
We'll, uh, probably get the idea
with literally any pumpkin?

26:01.083 --> 26:01.750
Oh, here.

26:01.784 --> 26:03.086
Okay, um...

26:06.020 --> 26:07.022
Sorry.

26:07.056 --> 26:07.757
- You got it?
- Sorry.

26:07.789 --> 26:08.423
- Yapa!
- Alright, good.

26:08.458 --> 26:09.292
- Yes, okay.
- Yay.

26:10.259 --> 26:11.728
Okay, good.

26:11.760 --> 26:13.162
Let me get it this way.

26:13.194 --> 26:14.062
Great.

26:14.096 --> 26:15.198
Is it cute?

26:15.230 --> 26:15.664
It's so...

26:16.464 --> 26:17.165
Cute.

26:17.199 --> 26:18.366
- Oh, okay.
- Oh.

26:18.400 --> 26:19.134
Look at this!

26:19.167 --> 26:20.335
It's like matching.

26:20.368 --> 26:21.369
Aw!

26:25.140 --> 26:28.009
This is how literally
every horror movie starts.

26:28.042 --> 26:29.846
Oh my God, Noor,
stop being such a baby.

26:29.878 --> 26:32.180
I am brown, gay, and pregnant.

26:32.213 --> 26:33.750
Who do you think is dying first
in this movie?

26:34.683 --> 26:36.918
Okay, we'll go left,
you guys go right,

26:36.951 --> 26:38.520
and we'll race to the middle.

26:38.554 --> 26:41.891
We can't all just like walk
through a corn maze together?

26:41.923 --> 26:44.326
Where is the unnecessary
competition in that?

26:44.359 --> 26:46.027
Come on,
it'll be like the Amazing Race,

26:46.060 --> 26:47.929
they're the token gays
and we're the closeted Mormons

26:47.962 --> 26:48.998
who aren't tryin'
to push their lives

26:49.030 --> 26:50.031
on anybody else.

26:50.065 --> 26:50.866
Ready, set, go.

26:51.567 --> 26:52.769
We're tokens.

26:52.801 --> 26:53.936
Let's go fast, I wanna win.

26:54.703 --> 26:57.405
When we start our
year at village in Maine,

26:57.439 --> 26:58.841
I was thinking...

26:58.874 --> 26:59.842
Can Teddy come?

26:59.875 --> 27:00.409
Teddy?

27:00.442 --> 27:02.044
Tinder Teddy.

27:02.076 --> 27:03.145
Oh, wow.

27:03.179 --> 27:03.813
Well,
I didn't realize Tinder Teddy

27:03.846 --> 27:06.048
was a farm in Maine serious.

27:06.080 --> 27:09.317
Um, George, I have something
really important to tell you,

27:09.351 --> 27:10.887
but you have
to keep it a secret, okay?

27:10.920 --> 27:13.489
Oh my God, who knew a corny maze
could get more exciting?

27:14.957 --> 27:16.025
Alright.

27:16.057 --> 27:23.098
Um, I'm thinking
of becoming a surrogate.

27:23.132 --> 27:25.535
A surrogate what?

27:25.567 --> 27:27.403
Like... like mother.

27:27.869 --> 27:29.304
Are you serious?

27:29.337 --> 27:31.206
Yeah.

27:31.240 --> 27:32.575
For who?

27:34.175 --> 27:36.144
Uh, that guy we met
at the bar the other night.

27:36.178 --> 27:37.480
Roger.

27:37.512 --> 27:38.614
I've... I've been
spending a lot of time with him

27:38.647 --> 27:42.384
and I... he told me he was tryin'
to have kids forever.

27:42.417 --> 27:43.251
What?

27:43.286 --> 27:44.187
I... do you think
this is totally crazy?

27:44.220 --> 27:47.088
Milo, babies are for women
in their mid-30s

27:47.122 --> 27:48.090
who are tryin'
to save their marriage

27:48.123 --> 27:49.125
and start parenting blogs.

27:49.157 --> 27:50.959
Oh my God, George.

27:50.992 --> 27:53.096
- Hey, seriously?
- Yeah.

27:55.897 --> 27:59.836
Can you actually imagine
givin' up a baby, though?

28:01.871 --> 28:02.672
I mean l... uh, listen,

28:02.704 --> 28:04.105
I know
it's gonna be really intense

28:04.138 --> 28:05.507
and really difficult,

28:05.540 --> 28:06.608
but I just feel like everything
in my life right now

28:06.642 --> 28:09.045
is like the same level
of difficult

28:09.077 --> 28:10.312
and not difficult at all.

28:10.346 --> 28:13.015
And it's just... honestly,
it's really paralyzing

28:13.048 --> 28:14.549
to never feel pushed
to do something terrifying

28:14.583 --> 28:16.485
and meaningful.

28:16.518 --> 28:17.386
you know?

28:19.087 --> 28:20.255
Shit, wow.

28:22.625 --> 28:24.227
Can we start a
gay parenting Instagram

28:24.259 --> 28:25.260
called "Roommates" or something?

28:25.294 --> 28:27.563
Uh, yes!

28:27.596 --> 28:28.029
Yes.

28:28.063 --> 28:29.532
Obviously, yes.

28:29.565 --> 28:31.033
Mm.

28:31.066 --> 28:32.235
Uh.

28:32.268 --> 28:33.169
Okay, you promise
you don't think this is

28:33.202 --> 28:35.136
like the craziest thing
I've ever done.

28:35.170 --> 28:36.572
Oh, I think
you're totally fuckin' crazy,

28:36.605 --> 28:39.008
but I also think this is
a pretty awesome thing.

28:39.040 --> 28:40.308
Also, oh my God,
a fuckin' baby.

28:40.342 --> 28:41.509
I love other people's kids,
I get to give back.

28:41.542 --> 28:43.111
Yeah.

28:43.144 --> 28:44.646
Okay.

28:44.680 --> 28:46.349
Just don't tell Noor yet okay?

28:46.382 --> 28:46.949
Why?

28:46.982 --> 28:48.951
I ju... I... come on, I...

28:48.983 --> 28:50.653
I do not need to
be talked out of it right now.

28:53.021 --> 28:54.123
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

28:57.159 --> 28:58.494
I go, "pow".

28:59.662 --> 29:00.596
So pretty and...

29:00.628 --> 29:01.897
Glad we came.

29:06.101 --> 29:06.502
- Oh!
- Fuck.

29:07.336 --> 29:07.970
- Ow!
- What happened?

29:08.002 --> 29:09.605
Oh shit, my ankle!

29:10.471 --> 29:11.374
What the fuck, Milo?

29:11.406 --> 29:12.574
She's pregnant.

29:12.607 --> 29:14.277
I know, I'm... uh, are you okay?

29:14.309 --> 29:15.543
I'm sorry.

29:15.576 --> 29:17.046
- You know I hate being scared.
- I know.

29:17.078 --> 29:18.446
I'm really sorry,
that was stupid.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.216
- Are you okay?
- I don't know.

29:20.249 --> 29:21.284
It's awesome.

29:57.553 --> 30:00.323
Hey,
do you guys sell ovulation tests?

30:45.233 --> 30:46.067
Hi.

30:46.101 --> 30:47.169
Hi.

30:47.201 --> 30:48.770
Hi, what... uh,
it's good to see you.

30:48.804 --> 30:50.439
Didn't we say a couple of weeks?

30:50.471 --> 30:52.141
Yes, you know, but
uh, I was just thinking

30:52.173 --> 30:54.609
like does it make a difference?

30:54.643 --> 30:56.511
You know you've been thinking
about this for 20 years, right?

30:56.545 --> 30:58.413
What... huh, what's another week?

30:58.446 --> 31:00.081
Like when you... oh, when...
when you're a dad,

31:00.115 --> 31:02.084
you're not gonna have like
the luxury of time, you know?

31:02.116 --> 31:04.252
You're just gonna have to
like make snap decisions

31:04.286 --> 31:05.453
from your gut.

31:05.487 --> 31:06.389
Do you have like a... a cup
or something?

31:07.321 --> 31:08.790
Uh.

31:08.824 --> 31:10.292
Ah, thank you.

31:10.325 --> 31:11.393
Okay, so I was thinking

31:11.425 --> 31:14.195
like we could go poll a room
of 100 people, right,

31:14.229 --> 31:15.798
and see if they think
this is a good idea or not,

31:15.830 --> 31:17.132
but what if the answer is "no"?

31:19.734 --> 31:20.535
Okay.

31:24.173 --> 31:26.808
It's gotta be now
or like maybe in another month,

31:26.842 --> 31:29.245
but it's... it's not gonna be
in two weeks.

31:29.278 --> 31:32.048
We need to draw up a contract
or something first

31:32.080 --> 31:33.815
at the very least.

31:33.848 --> 31:35.617
I will sign whatever you want me
to sign, okay,

31:35.651 --> 31:38.354
but... but like you know,
how when you're out drunk

31:38.386 --> 31:40.288
with friends and...
and someone's like, "Oh,

31:40.321 --> 31:41.589
we should all go camping",

31:41.623 --> 31:43.259
and then another person is like,
"Yeah, yeah, yeah,

31:43.291 --> 31:44.793
I have family in Maine",
and then someone else is like,

31:44.826 --> 31:46.461
"Ooh I have a tent" you know,
and then...

31:46.494 --> 31:47.562
And then you wake up
the next morning,

31:47.596 --> 31:49.698
and everyone like still pretends
to be into the idea,

31:49.730 --> 31:51.333
but the idea has just
like totally lost its magic,

31:51.365 --> 31:52.334
and it never ends up happening.

31:53.102 --> 31:54.170
What?

31:54.202 --> 31:55.336
I'm just saying.

31:55.369 --> 31:56.738
I think there's like something
to be said

31:56.771 --> 31:59.407
for riding the momentum.

31:59.441 --> 32:02.310
I don't know anything about you
or your family history.

32:02.344 --> 32:05.114
- Did you even go to college?
- Yes, I went to college!

32:05.146 --> 32:06.682
I went to Vassar.

32:06.714 --> 32:08.451
I... I double majored in music,
and Greek, and Roman studies.

32:08.483 --> 32:09.651
Awesome, useful choice.

32:09.684 --> 32:13.254
Um, I got a 2110 on my SATs,
I'm allergic to pet dander,

32:13.288 --> 32:14.824
and kiwis.

32:14.856 --> 32:17.660
I'm on 20 milligrams of Celexa
for depression and anxiety,

32:17.692 --> 32:18.795
and um...

32:20.761 --> 32:24.265
Both of my parents are dead.

32:25.666 --> 32:27.602
- Is that supposed to be a joke?
- No.

32:27.635 --> 32:30.439
No, no, they're both...
they're both actually dead.

32:30.471 --> 32:32.340
My dad died five years ago
of pancreatic cancer

32:32.374 --> 32:35.177
and my mom um,

32:35.210 --> 32:36.511
she committed suicide
when I was 10.

32:36.545 --> 32:39.148
So you have full disclosure,

32:39.181 --> 32:41.549
you're like really,
really rolling the dice here,

32:41.583 --> 32:44.854
both physically and mentally,
but um,

32:44.886 --> 32:47.255
Roger, I'm here,
and I wanna do this, and I...

32:47.288 --> 32:49.424
I am in if you are.

32:50.858 --> 32:51.726
Uh, you know, at least,

32:51.759 --> 32:54.195
if your kid
turns out super fucked up,

32:54.229 --> 32:55.498
no one can
blame the single gay parent.

32:58.901 --> 32:59.567
What the hell?

32:59.601 --> 33:01.203
Okay.

33:01.236 --> 33:05.141
Um, I don't think I'm gonna
get another shot at this.

33:05.173 --> 33:06.142
Yeah?

33:06.174 --> 33:08.443
Yeah.

33:08.477 --> 33:09.545
Okay.

33:15.717 --> 33:16.886
I'm worried
I'm gonna get whiskey dick.

33:22.324 --> 33:25.461
So what do we do?

33:25.493 --> 33:29.531
Uh, well, when um,
a very, very old drag queen

33:29.565 --> 33:30.900
loves a young coed very much...

33:32.834 --> 33:33.869
No.

33:33.902 --> 33:34.603
Uh,
what kinda porn do you watch?

33:34.635 --> 33:36.571
Milo, come on.

33:36.605 --> 33:37.740
Oh my God, Roger,

33:37.772 --> 33:38.807
stop clutching those pearls
so tightly.

33:40.208 --> 33:43.278
Okay, let's see, let's see.

33:43.311 --> 33:45.947
Okay, uh, here we have
what looks like a gym teacher

33:45.980 --> 33:49.317
who's probably not winning
any teacher of the year awards.

33:49.351 --> 33:51.353
Ooh, we got a dad
who should definitely

33:51.385 --> 33:52.954
not be doing that
with the stepson.

33:52.988 --> 33:56.424
Okay, um, orgy, May-December
Ebony and Ivory.

33:56.458 --> 33:59.894
Just normal average
gay consenting adults, please.

34:00.962 --> 34:01.797
Okay.

34:04.767 --> 34:06.634
- Hey.
- Hi.

34:06.667 --> 34:07.769
I'm Steve, the RA.

34:07.803 --> 34:08.835
Alright.

34:08.869 --> 34:10.672
I'm sorry, we were just uh...

34:10.706 --> 34:11.507
- Milo, I just...
- What?

34:11.539 --> 34:14.509
- Uh.
- Just pretend I'm Steve, The RA.

34:21.148 --> 34:23.652
My um,
high school boyfriend said

34:23.684 --> 34:25.320
that I was really,
really good at this

34:25.353 --> 34:26.888
and he's gay now, so...

34:29.992 --> 34:32.527
I'll um, I'll be back.

Uh, and for the mug.

35:48.670 --> 35:51.572
Wow, you uh, really didn't need
to bring a gift

35:51.606 --> 35:52.407
to the first date.

35:52.440 --> 35:53.742
I know how a lady
should be treated.

35:55.610 --> 35:57.579
Um, I found this
in the bathroom.

35:57.612 --> 35:58.579
I'm pretty sure
they gave it to me

35:58.612 --> 36:01.783
to clean out my stitches
when I had oral surgery,

36:01.817 --> 36:03.686
but I don't think
I ever ended up using it.

36:03.719 --> 36:05.054
Great.

36:05.086 --> 36:07.922
Uh, do you wanna do this
out here or...

36:07.956 --> 36:09.057
No, that's fine.

36:09.090 --> 36:09.958
You can use my room.

36:09.990 --> 36:12.527
It's not...

36:12.561 --> 36:14.063
I was in the bathroom.

36:14.096 --> 36:14.896
Okay.

36:16.530 --> 36:17.666
Um, when was the last time you
had a half-naked lady

36:17.699 --> 36:19.034
in your bed?

36:19.067 --> 36:21.670
1983.

36:21.702 --> 36:23.471
Okay.

36:23.505 --> 36:24.773
Are you ready for this?

36:30.644 --> 36:32.514
Cheers.

36:33.715 --> 36:35.451
Oh, yes, thank you.

36:45.994 --> 36:48.497
I normally hate
having my hair touched.

36:48.530 --> 36:49.631
- Sorry.
- No!

36:49.664 --> 36:51.367
No, no, no, it... it...
keep going,

36:51.400 --> 36:52.735
it feels nice actually.

36:57.606 --> 37:00.676
So how did...
how did you end up here?

37:00.708 --> 37:01.743
Oh.

37:01.777 --> 37:04.880
Um, I was 21,

37:04.913 --> 37:09.385
and so happy to be out
of fucking Shipshewana, Indiana,

37:09.418 --> 37:12.621
and then I was really shocked
watching people get high,

37:12.653 --> 37:14.889
and fuck each other
at night in the park,

37:14.922 --> 37:17.024
and I didn't wanna be shocked,

37:17.057 --> 37:20.094
'cause I literally dreamed
of being here forever.

37:20.128 --> 37:23.899
I was this little
counter cultural twink

37:23.931 --> 37:26.868
just bloated
with irony and angst at home.

37:26.902 --> 37:28.170
And I got here,

37:28.202 --> 37:30.639
and I was like a nun
who'd escaped the convent.

37:34.141 --> 37:34.975
I wanted to be Freddie Mercury,

37:35.010 --> 37:37.146
but I knew I looked
like Fred Savage.

37:39.514 --> 37:40.782
And that killed me.

37:44.552 --> 37:45.221
That's alright.

37:45.253 --> 37:47.422
So what's your story, chickadee?

37:47.956 --> 37:50.492
Mm-mm.

37:50.525 --> 37:52.059
Honestly,
I just kind of always wanted

37:52.092 --> 37:53.861
to be the girl in the band

37:53.894 --> 37:56.063
instead of the girl
with the dead parents.

37:56.097 --> 37:57.666
Hmm.

37:57.699 --> 38:00.101
Yeah, well, joke's on me,
because they're still dead

38:00.135 --> 38:02.571
and I'm not even in a band.

38:03.972 --> 38:05.775
So...

38:07.675 --> 38:08.443
I should go.

38:08.476 --> 38:11.980
I um, I...
I really feel fertilized.

38:13.581 --> 38:15.150
Milo, I... I really, I...
I can't thank you enough.

38:15.182 --> 38:18.052
I... um, let's uh, get together
in a couple of weeks,

38:18.085 --> 38:20.154
and talk about compensation
and everything.

38:20.188 --> 38:21.923
Roger,
that is not why I'm doing this.

38:21.956 --> 38:22.625
Come on, that's ridiculous.

38:22.657 --> 38:23.858
I will see you in a few weeks.

38:23.891 --> 38:25.193
Let's do something fun.

38:32.601 --> 38:33.836
George!

38:37.105 --> 38:38.106
Teddy.

38:40.641 --> 38:41.141
Ooh. You know,
she just peed on that!

38:41.175 --> 38:42.210
I just peed on that!

38:42.242 --> 38:44.112
Hi, please, hi, I'm Teddy,
it's so nice to meet.

38:44.144 --> 38:45.980
And you are definitely pregnant.

38:47.047 --> 38:48.182
Oh my God, oh my God,
oh my God!

38:48.215 --> 38:49.384
Oh, so like I don't even
know you,

38:49.416 --> 38:51.119
but I feel like that gay friend
the producer's bringin'

38:51.152 --> 38:52.920
on 16 and Pregnant
to ask the girl

38:52.954 --> 38:54.189
how she's doing
with all of this.

38:54.222 --> 38:55.858
Oh shit, okay, I gotta...
I gotta call Roger.

38:55.891 --> 38:57.659
- No.
- What? Why?

38:57.692 --> 38:59.094
Hey, where's the pageantry?

38:59.126 --> 39:00.262
You're only
gonna be gay pregnant once,

39:00.295 --> 39:01.597
at least put on a show.

39:01.630 --> 39:02.597
What do you want me to do?

39:02.630 --> 39:04.500
Like bake it into a fucking cake
or something?

39:04.532 --> 39:08.269
I was thinkin' more like
you exit a cab full of doves,

39:08.302 --> 39:10.938
dressed as the Virgin Mary
in a rainbow shroud.

39:10.972 --> 39:12.541
George, I'm not doing that.

39:12.574 --> 39:14.108
Okay, fine, then at least
tell him in person.

39:14.141 --> 39:16.010
Okay, I will!

40:07.596 --> 40:09.130
You know, it's Hesus.

40:09.164 --> 40:11.266
Not when you're turning water
into wine.

40:11.298 --> 40:13.268
This is Milo, my baby mama.

40:13.300 --> 40:15.069
It's like I'm meetin'
the Virgin of Guadalupe

40:15.103 --> 40:15.836
in person herself.

40:15.869 --> 40:17.105
Hmm.

40:17.137 --> 40:20.608
A glass of your okayes champagne
for Daddy Roger.

40:20.641 --> 40:22.043
Ew, stop saying it like that.

40:22.811 --> 40:23.812
What can I gonna get you, mama?

40:23.844 --> 40:24.946
Sunset surprise?

40:24.980 --> 40:26.048
Mm-mm.

40:26.081 --> 40:27.149
No, she can't drink,
she's pregnant.

40:27.181 --> 40:29.617
No, I'll have a glass
of red please.

40:29.650 --> 40:30.885
I've actually read a bunch
of articles

40:30.918 --> 40:32.920
that say it's completely fine
to have a glass of wine or two

40:32.954 --> 40:33.889
while you're pregnant,

40:33.922 --> 40:36.358
as long as you're not
like downing shots.

40:36.391 --> 40:39.161
It's just this like fear
propagated by suburban mothers

40:39.193 --> 40:40.929
that are just
sitting at home obsessing

40:40.961 --> 40:42.965
about their future prodigy
and graduating summa cum laude

40:42.998 --> 40:45.000
from Harvard.

40:45.032 --> 40:46.268
People fuck their kids up
way worse

40:46.300 --> 40:48.069
by bein' Republicans
or Scientologists.

40:48.103 --> 40:49.104
Uh, right?

40:49.137 --> 40:50.238
Salud.

40:50.271 --> 40:51.306
graduating summa cum laude
from Harvard

40:51.338 --> 40:52.807
doesn't sound like
the worst thing in the world.

40:52.840 --> 40:53.674
Salud.

40:53.708 --> 40:55.143
Mm.

40:55.175 --> 40:56.844
So do you have
any names picked out?

40:56.878 --> 40:57.546
Well, my uh,

40:57.579 --> 40:59.014
late grandmother's name was Edna

40:59.047 --> 41:00.615
and she was the kind of
brass tacks

41:00.648 --> 41:03.317
first-generation bitch
we need more of in this world.

41:04.152 --> 41:05.354
What?

41:05.387 --> 41:06.989
Sorry uh, there's just something
about babies

41:07.021 --> 41:08.090
with old-timey names.

41:08.123 --> 41:11.126
It just seems so like twee
and self-important to me.

41:11.159 --> 41:11.693
I don't know.

41:11.726 --> 41:13.795
I think it's kinda cute.

41:13.827 --> 41:16.163
Okay, I'm keeping this baby
if you name it Edna.

41:16.197 --> 41:16.965
Okay.

41:16.998 --> 41:18.200
Not Edna then.

41:21.902 --> 41:23.304
Thank you. Thank you.

41:23.338 --> 41:24.072
Okay, okay, okay, do me.

41:24.106 --> 41:25.107
Alright, give it to me.

41:25.139 --> 41:26.007
Okay.

41:30.344 --> 41:31.112
Alright, alright, alright.

41:31.146 --> 41:33.715
Oh, I got it, I got it,
I got it.

41:33.748 --> 41:36.652
- Ready?
- Yes.

41:36.684 --> 41:37.418
Yeah.

41:38.952 --> 41:39.887
Okay.

41:41.856 --> 41:44.226
She's just
another white teenager

41:44.259 --> 41:48.730
who doesn't quite fit in
at her entirely white school.

41:48.762 --> 41:52.366
I know who J.D. Salinger is,
but nobody else does.

41:52.400 --> 41:56.905
This spring, she'll find
three other weirdos

41:56.938 --> 41:59.775
and a science teacher
to be friends with.

41:59.807 --> 42:01.009
Probably stupid.

42:03.277 --> 42:05.413
You'll find that
sometimes growing up

42:05.447 --> 42:08.416
means standing out.

42:08.449 --> 42:12.119
I'm 16, but my over familiar
relationship with adults

42:12.152 --> 42:15.923
is completely normal,
because I'm mature for my age.

42:15.956 --> 42:17.224
Yeah, pop that booty.

42:17.257 --> 42:18.759
Pop that booty.

42:18.793 --> 42:19.428
No, no, no, no, no!

42:19.460 --> 42:20.227
Do not get up.

42:20.260 --> 42:21.797
What do you want?

42:21.829 --> 42:23.699
Um, I was just gonna grab
a seltzer from the fridge.

42:23.731 --> 42:24.699
- I'll get it.
- Thank you.

42:24.733 --> 42:25.768
You're welcome.

42:27.202 --> 42:29.404
There's some wine in
there, too, if you want it.

42:29.436 --> 42:32.074
KJ feels so guilty drinking
without me.

42:32.106 --> 42:35.009
She has like a thimble per week.

42:36.443 --> 42:38.279
Finish it
before it turns into vinegar.

42:38.313 --> 42:39.081
No, I'm good.

42:39.114 --> 42:40.449
I'm just
gonna have a seltzer, too.

42:40.481 --> 42:41.882
You okay?

42:43.016 --> 42:43.484
Yeah.

42:43.518 --> 42:44.853
Uh, wow.

42:44.885 --> 42:47.088
Am I really
that much of an alcoholic?

42:47.121 --> 42:47.955
No, I've just never known you

42:47.989 --> 42:51.192
to turn down
a glass of wine before.

42:51.226 --> 42:53.361
Well, um, I'm...

42:53.393 --> 42:56.263
I'm pregnant.

42:56.297 --> 42:58.467
You're fucking with me.

43:01.835 --> 43:03.170
Nope.

43:03.204 --> 43:05.474
Two months

43:05.507 --> 43:06.942
How?

43:06.974 --> 43:08.009
I didn't even know
you were seeing anyone.

43:08.043 --> 43:11.512
I'm not, I met this
really awesome older gay man

43:11.545 --> 43:14.048
who desperately wants
to be a dad and I...

43:14.081 --> 43:15.317
I offered to be a surrogate.

43:15.349 --> 43:16.018
I don't know.

43:16.050 --> 43:16.717
We got really close, we've had...

43:16.751 --> 43:18.487
What are you even talking about?

43:18.519 --> 43:19.855
That's insane!

43:19.887 --> 43:22.023
This is insane.

43:22.056 --> 43:23.391
No, honestly,
I don't need a lawyer right now.

43:23.423 --> 43:25.192
Thank you.

43:25.226 --> 43:27.929
This... this is exactly... fuck,
what I told George would happen.

43:27.961 --> 43:30.264
- You told George?
- Yes, dude, I did okay?

43:30.297 --> 43:31.265
And I'm not gonna
be guilt-tripped,

43:31.298 --> 43:32.934
because I chose to tell someone
that I knew

43:32.967 --> 43:33.800
who would just support me.

43:33.835 --> 43:35.237
Being supportive
is not the same thing

43:35.269 --> 43:36.438
as being enabling.

43:36.471 --> 43:38.005
I'm not like an addict, Noor,
okay?

43:38.039 --> 43:39.841
I'm an adult like you

43:39.873 --> 43:41.275
and I'm allowed
to make decisions.

43:41.309 --> 43:43.912
I'm allowed to make like really,
really big life decisions.

43:43.945 --> 43:45.213
But it's never a decision
with you,

43:45.246 --> 43:46.548
it's always just an impulse.

43:46.581 --> 43:47.916
Yeah, you know what it is?

43:47.949 --> 43:48.849
It's never just
advice with you, dude,

43:48.884 --> 43:50.251
It's always just
a fuckin' therapy session.

43:58.293 --> 44:00.229
Oh shit.

44:10.172 --> 44:12.240
Okay, not one,
but two-months' pregnant,

44:12.273 --> 44:14.543
on 1, 2, 3.

44:20.248 --> 44:21.449
I'm gonna shake it.

44:21.481 --> 44:23.851

45:42.597 --> 45:43.231
You're welcome to String Theory.

we keep in the back.

45:48.603 --> 45:52.507
Milo, why didn't you tell us you
had Cameron Owusu in the shop?

45:52.539 --> 45:53.909
Who?

45:54.275 --> 45:55.477
Hmm.

45:55.510 --> 45:58.513
This man is the lead guitarist
for After After.

45:58.545 --> 46:01.315
No way, that's nuts,
I've seen you guys play!

46:01.349 --> 46:03.351
Motion to set Milo adrift
on a flaming raft.

46:03.384 --> 46:05.387
- Yay!
- Nay.

46:05.420 --> 46:06.221
Tough call,

46:06.253 --> 46:08.255
but tie vote defaults
to the nays.

46:08.289 --> 46:09.190
Lucky.

46:09.222 --> 46:11.092
Anyway.

46:11.125 --> 46:13.360
Uh, are you still interested
in that Johnson?

46:13.393 --> 46:15.596
Nah, that kinda fell through.

46:15.630 --> 46:17.132
I'm just here
to pick up some strings

46:17.164 --> 46:18.065
and a looper pedal.

46:19.300 --> 46:20.468
Guys.

46:20.501 --> 46:21.670
Guys, Milo,
helped me out the last time

46:21.702 --> 46:23.704
and I didn't buy anything,
so I'm gonna

46:23.737 --> 46:27.207
give her the sales commission
on this one.

46:27.240 --> 46:30.311
So just uh, swingin' by
your favorite

46:30.344 --> 46:33.414
three-star Yelp-reviewed
specialty Brooklyn guitar shop

46:33.447 --> 46:35.016
or like what?

46:35.048 --> 46:38.253
Straight up, I was kinda hopin'
you'd be here.

46:38.286 --> 46:39.487
I tried to call you
on the number

46:39.519 --> 46:41.222
on your business card, but...

46:41.255 --> 46:43.023
Oh yeah, that's the phone here.

46:43.056 --> 46:45.392
They've destroyed it last year,
because it was ringing too much.

46:45.425 --> 46:47.061
But can I give you my number,
so you have it?

46:47.094 --> 46:48.195
Yes, you may.

46:53.166 --> 46:54.135
Thank you.

46:59.340 --> 47:00.409
Jesus.

47:02.677 --> 47:04.646
Hey, you're all dolled up.

47:04.679 --> 47:07.081
Hey, yeah, I got a hot date.

47:07.114 --> 47:07.782
With me?

47:07.815 --> 47:10.518
No, with a very fine musician.

47:10.550 --> 47:12.386
I uh,
totally fucked up my makeup,

47:12.420 --> 47:15.023
so I came to beg for a touch-up,
and I figured I'd stop by

47:15.056 --> 47:17.157
and bring you some literature
you might like,

47:17.190 --> 47:20.061
very queer, very downright,
social construct.

47:21.561 --> 47:23.331
Oh, huh.

47:25.065 --> 47:26.233
Great minds.

47:26.266 --> 47:28.102
No, thank you, that's great.

47:28.135 --> 47:31.139
I can give it to one of the dads
in my dad group.

47:31.172 --> 47:32.206
You're in a dad group?

47:32.239 --> 47:34.541
That's... that's fun.

47:34.574 --> 47:36.643
Yeah, it's like this
whole underbelly of New York

47:36.677 --> 47:37.745
I had no idea existed.

47:37.777 --> 47:40.614
I'm like a suburban housewife
who just discovered

47:40.648 --> 47:42.350
narcotics anonymous meets
at her church basement

47:42.382 --> 47:43.183
on Wednesdays.

47:44.085 --> 47:46.320
Well, um, let me know
if you need me

47:46.353 --> 47:48.389
for
bring-your-spunky-surrogate day.

47:50.358 --> 47:53.428
It's more of a chance
for gay dads

47:53.460 --> 47:56.464
and prospective dads to connect
and support each other, but...

47:59.634 --> 48:01.702
Okay, uh, do you have
any liquid liner?

48:01.735 --> 48:03.137
This is a mess.

48:03.170 --> 48:03.637
Yeah.

48:03.670 --> 48:05.373
Um, fair warning,

48:05.405 --> 48:07.808
I don't have much experience
with civilian makeup.

48:07.842 --> 48:09.210
That's okay.

48:09.242 --> 48:12.047
I can look like Lady Esther
on the right

48:12.079 --> 48:14.148
and Lady Bunny on the left.

48:17.717 --> 48:20.587
Hello, Bergen,
and welcome to trivia night.

48:20.621 --> 48:24.358
As always, I am your host Giana,
this is my partner Jamie.

48:24.391 --> 48:25.759
We are
with Broadly Entertaining.

48:25.793 --> 48:29.264
first things first, you gotta
come up with a team name.

48:29.297 --> 48:32.067
Now your team name does not have
to be funny or clever,

48:32.099 --> 48:33.835
but it sure helps

48:33.867 --> 48:36.503
I mean if it's not a guitar pun,
we're doin' something wrong.

48:36.536 --> 48:39.173
Mm, puns and roses, thin quizzy,
pinball quizzard.

48:39.206 --> 48:40.607
You just got
those loaded and about?

48:40.641 --> 48:41.443
Yes, yes, I do.

48:41.476 --> 48:43.278
I can go on all night.

48:43.311 --> 48:44.479
How about G string?

48:44.512 --> 48:46.247
Yeah,
that seems a little bass for me,

48:46.280 --> 48:49.117
but um, I can fuck with it,

48:49.150 --> 48:50.385
Oh, I'm sorry.

48:50.418 --> 48:53.253
My puns
aren't up to your standards

48:53.286 --> 48:55.622
unless bass was supposed
to be a pun,

48:55.655 --> 48:57.358
in which case
they most definitely are.

48:57.391 --> 48:58.526
Mm.

48:58.559 --> 49:01.496
Takes a lot of practice
to be this lame.

49:01.528 --> 49:03.565
Cameron, hi, hi, hi.

49:03.597 --> 49:04.099
Hey.

49:04.132 --> 49:04.699
Bee's Knees for you?

49:04.733 --> 49:06.835
Fuck me up, Kim.

49:06.867 --> 49:08.335
And for you?

49:08.369 --> 49:13.173
Um, I would just
like a soda and lime, please.

49:13.206 --> 49:14.409
Alright, folks.

49:14.442 --> 49:17.778
Nolan Ryan,
nicknamed the Ryan Express,

49:17.811 --> 49:21.449
he holds the all-time record
for no hitters.

49:21.481 --> 49:25.420
Please tell us one
of the four major league teams

49:25.452 --> 49:28.222
he pitched for in his career.

49:30.557 --> 49:32.460
The Mets, the Angels,
the Astros, the Rangers.

49:32.492 --> 49:33.360
What?

49:33.393 --> 49:35.262
Hey, sports fan.

49:35.295 --> 49:36.530
My dad grew up in Ghana,

49:36.563 --> 49:38.799
but he was obsessed
with American baseball.

49:38.833 --> 49:41.269
He still collects cards.

49:41.302 --> 49:42.903
You see,
this is why I like trivia.

49:42.936 --> 49:45.139
Let's you rush past
all the what's your middle name,

49:45.172 --> 49:46.040
and do you have any pets,

49:46.074 --> 49:48.610
and get to
what's actually interesting.

49:48.643 --> 49:50.311
There you go.

49:51.278 --> 49:53.181
- Hey, enjoy.
- Thank you.

49:53.213 --> 49:56.550
Are you sure
you don't wanna drink drink?

49:56.583 --> 49:57.784
Uh, yeah, no, I just...
I don't know.

49:57.818 --> 49:59.754
I don't wanna get tired.

49:59.786 --> 50:07.661
Roland Orzabal was one half
of which English pop rock band?

50:07.695 --> 50:09.831
Tears for Fears, bitch.

50:09.864 --> 50:11.666
I was actually
junior class social chair

50:11.699 --> 50:12.800
and I refused to play anything

50:12.833 --> 50:14.635
besides British
'80s rock anthems

50:14.668 --> 50:16.237
for all three and a half hours
of homecoming

50:16.269 --> 50:18.273
and they unanimously voted
to impeach me

50:18.306 --> 50:19.941
halfway through the dance, so...

50:19.974 --> 50:23.912
That's kinda baller
in a really, really lame way.

50:23.945 --> 50:25.547
Funny that you say that,

50:25.579 --> 50:28.348
because lame baller was
my very first AIM screen name

50:28.382 --> 50:30.818
and it will be the title
of my autobiography.

50:30.851 --> 50:32.921
Alright, friends,
for number three...

50:34.789 --> 50:37.392
Oh, whoa!

50:37.425 --> 50:38.693
Cute.

50:38.726 --> 50:41.563
Hmm, welcome to the pad.

50:41.596 --> 50:44.565
A first place trophy would have
looked so good in here.

50:44.599 --> 50:47.235
No, they don't give you a trophy
for first place.

50:47.268 --> 50:48.503
I'd know.

50:48.536 --> 50:51.539
Well, thanks for
my consolation prize sticker.

50:51.572 --> 50:53.508
I'm um,
I'm gonna look at it every day

50:53.541 --> 50:54.976
and think about
how mediocre I am.

50:55.009 --> 50:56.911
You need a sticker for that?

50:56.943 --> 50:58.380
I guess I do.

50:59.847 --> 51:03.718
I don't think
you're mediocre at all.

51:03.751 --> 51:05.320
I think you're the worst.

51:26.273 --> 51:26.807
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

51:26.840 --> 51:29.344
Um, hold on a sec, okay?

51:29.376 --> 51:30.679
Uh...

51:42.989 --> 51:44.324
Hey.

51:44.358 --> 51:46.494
Hey.

51:46.527 --> 51:48.396
Did you put on my shirt?

51:51.431 --> 51:53.033
I'm sorry,
I didn't tell you earlier.

51:53.067 --> 51:54.869
I just uh...

51:54.902 --> 51:56.737
You know, it didn't come up

51:56.771 --> 51:58.873
in any of the trivia
night questions, so...

51:58.905 --> 52:01.643
Yeah, I feel like maybe you
could have mentioned it

52:01.675 --> 52:04.411
before I had your clothes
halfway off your body.

52:04.445 --> 52:05.780
I mean would you have
still asked me out

52:05.813 --> 52:06.713
if I told you?

52:06.746 --> 52:07.815
That feels like entrapment.

52:07.847 --> 52:10.751
Don't they say entrapment
is like the sincerest form

52:10.784 --> 52:11.952
of flattery?

52:15.956 --> 52:17.925
I'm sorry.

52:17.958 --> 52:20.827
So after this what?

52:20.860 --> 52:25.400
Just another four or five months
and it's done?

52:25.432 --> 52:27.068
No, I mean I...
I think I'll be more

52:27.101 --> 52:30.938
like a... an aunt or um...

52:30.971 --> 52:32.572
I don't know.

52:32.606 --> 52:36.044
The non-denominational
godparent,

52:36.077 --> 52:38.780
like a not religious
to spiritual parent.

52:42.782 --> 52:47.422
Can I ask you why
you decided to do this?

52:47.454 --> 52:49.923
I mean I know it's...
it's like a great thing to do,

52:49.956 --> 52:52.826
but like why?

52:57.264 --> 52:58.965
Do you ever feel like um,

52:58.998 --> 53:01.802
like you've already experienced
the most intense version

53:01.835 --> 53:05.572
of like every emotion
you'll ever feel?

53:05.606 --> 53:06.708
What do you mean?

53:06.740 --> 53:08.809
Like...

53:08.842 --> 53:13.080
Okay, like, like um...
uh, like when you're a kid

53:13.114 --> 53:17.552
or um, or a teenager
and like you know,

53:17.585 --> 53:20.887
you feel fear or pain or loss
for the first time you know,

53:20.920 --> 53:22.790
it's... it's so intense.

53:24.958 --> 53:28.061
So you decided to do this
because it's like a...

53:28.094 --> 53:31.131
A new feeling?

53:31.164 --> 53:32.099
That...
I mean that makes me sound

53:32.132 --> 53:33.835
like I'm being
entirely self-serving, but...

53:33.867 --> 53:34.802
No, I'm just saying.

53:34.835 --> 53:38.004
It's a... it's a pretty
big decision to make

53:38.038 --> 53:40.641
for the sake of catharsis.

53:40.673 --> 53:47.815
Yeah, I mean when m...
I had a lot of...

53:49.150 --> 53:51.018
A lot of really
shitty family stuff happen

53:51.050 --> 53:52.586
when I was a kid and...

53:52.619 --> 53:54.588
Hmm.

53:54.621 --> 53:55.889
I don't know.

53:55.922 --> 53:57.858
I just looked for something else
to feel intensely

53:57.891 --> 54:02.462
to make the other feelings
seem duller.

54:02.496 --> 54:06.166
Like you know how when there's
a car alarm going off outside

54:06.199 --> 54:08.568
and like you turn on the AC
even though you're not hot,

54:08.601 --> 54:11.471
because like the sound
that's closer to your ear

54:11.505 --> 54:14.776
just kinda
quiets the louder one.

54:25.686 --> 54:26.421
I'm sorry.

54:26.454 --> 54:28.623
I just... I really...

54:28.655 --> 54:32.793
I really hate
having my hair played with.

54:32.827 --> 54:34.996
I like you a little bit, Milo.

54:38.865 --> 54:41.101
I like you a little bit, too.

54:56.516 --> 54:57.150
Okay.

54:57.184 --> 55:00.688
Um, Renée.

55:00.721 --> 55:02.190
- Too French.
- Mm.

55:02.222 --> 55:03.724
Jack?

55:03.757 --> 55:05.193
Too John Cougar Mellencamp.

55:05.860 --> 55:06.894
Okay.

55:06.927 --> 55:07.894
Voldemort.

55:07.927 --> 55:08.795
That is perfect.

55:12.632 --> 55:16.670
Do you ever talk to the baby
or... or read to it or anything?

55:16.704 --> 55:19.474
Uh, no.

55:19.507 --> 55:21.041
No, I guess I don't.

55:21.074 --> 55:24.945
I picked up this book of poems
about pregnancy

55:24.978 --> 55:26.913
and I don't know,
I wanted to give it to you

55:26.947 --> 55:28.883
in case you wanted to try it
sometime.

55:28.916 --> 55:31.652
I've read that it's good
for the baby to be talked to.

55:31.684 --> 55:34.221
Yes, of course.

55:34.255 --> 55:34.889
Uh.

55:34.922 --> 55:36.690
Ah, the Consecrating Mother.

55:36.724 --> 55:37.758
I love Anne Sexton.

55:37.791 --> 55:39.660
Okay.

55:39.693 --> 55:42.230
Uh, "I stand before the sea,

55:42.262 --> 55:45.699
and it rolls and rolls
in its green blood saying..."

55:45.733 --> 55:46.667
Can I actually read it?

55:46.699 --> 55:48.768
Um, if it's okay with you?

55:48.802 --> 55:53.140
I really want the baby
to know my voice

55:53.172 --> 55:54.674
if that's really a thing?

55:54.708 --> 55:55.710
I...

55:55.742 --> 55:57.612
Yes, of course, read it.

56:04.117 --> 56:09.523
"Saying, 'Do not give up
one God for I have a handful.'

56:09.556 --> 56:10.625
The trade winds blew

56:10.657 --> 56:12.058
in their twelve-fingered
reversal

56:12.092 --> 56:14.195
and I simply stood on the beach

56:14.228 --> 56:16.864
while the ocean
made a cross of salt

56:16.896 --> 56:22.636
and hung up its drowned
and they cried Deo Deo.

56:24.204 --> 56:27.875
The ocean offered them up
in the vein of its might.

56:27.907 --> 56:28.775
I wanted to share this,

56:28.809 --> 56:32.914
but I stood alone
like a pink scarecrow.

56:32.947 --> 56:35.782
The ocean steamed in and out,

56:35.815 --> 56:39.920
the ocean gasped upon the shore,
but I could not define her.

56:39.954 --> 56:44.926
I could not name her mood,
her locked-up faces.

56:44.958 --> 56:50.196
Far off, she rolled and rolled
like a woman in labor

56:50.230 --> 56:53.000
and I thought of those
who had crossed her

56:53.032 --> 56:58.873
in antiquity, in nautical trade,
in slavery, in war.

56:58.905 --> 57:03.009
I wondered how
she had borne those bulwarks.

57:03.043 --> 57:04.745
She should be entered
skin to skin

57:04.777 --> 57:07.781
and put on like one's first
or last cloth,

57:07.815 --> 57:10.251
envered like kneeling your way
into church,

57:10.284 --> 57:15.222
descending into that ascension,
though she be slick as olive oil

57:15.255 --> 57:19.794
as she climbs each wave
like an embezzler of white."

57:21.195 --> 57:22.930
Let's read the end together.

57:22.963 --> 57:24.098
Oh, okay.

57:25.865 --> 57:28.101
Uh, the big deep.

57:28.135 --> 57:32.340
"The big deep knows
the law as it wears its gray hat."

57:34.007 --> 57:36.276
"Though the
ocean comes in its destiny

57:36.309 --> 57:38.645
with its 100 lips,

57:38.679 --> 57:42.316
and in moonlight
she comes in her nudity,

57:42.349 --> 57:45.653
flashing breasts
made of milk water,

57:45.686 --> 57:49.957
flashing buttocks
made of unkillable lust,

57:49.989 --> 57:56.396
and at night when you enter her,
you shine like a neon soprano.

57:56.429 --> 58:01.101
I am that clumsy human
on the shore

58:01.135 --> 58:06.641
loving you,
coming, coming, going,

58:06.673 --> 58:11.813
and wish to put my thumb on you
like The Song of Solomon."

58:19.286 --> 58:20.688
There you go.

58:20.721 --> 58:22.789
Some little fingers
and toes there.

58:22.822 --> 58:23.723
We like fingers and toes.

58:23.757 --> 58:24.759
Yay, fingers and toes.

58:24.791 --> 58:27.427
Thanks, I grew them myself.

58:27.460 --> 58:29.396
Since you're a bit late
for your five-month appointment

58:29.429 --> 58:31.898
and your little friend
is being cooperative,

58:31.931 --> 58:33.767
I can tell you the sex today
if you wanna know.

58:33.800 --> 58:34.835
- Oh my God, wonderful.
- Oh, no.

58:34.867 --> 58:35.902
No, I don't really wanna know.

58:38.706 --> 58:39.240
Okay.

58:41.108 --> 58:42.343
It's common for one parent
to wanna know

58:42.376 --> 58:44.345
and the other
to remain surprised.

58:44.378 --> 58:46.414
Ms. Winiker, if you wanna
step out of the room after this,

58:46.447 --> 58:49.349
I can tell Mr. Nyhum
the sex of the baby.

58:49.382 --> 58:51.117
I think I'd really like to know.

58:51.150 --> 58:52.886
I'm... I'm 52.

58:52.920 --> 58:53.988
At this point,
I'd like to remove

58:54.021 --> 58:57.124
as much uncertainty
from the process as possible.

58:57.157 --> 58:59.026
Yeah, I just...
I always imagined

58:59.059 --> 59:01.062
being surprised the first time,
you know?

59:01.094 --> 59:03.963
Did you imagine it like this?

59:03.996 --> 59:05.298
Roger, I don't wanna know, okay?

59:05.331 --> 59:06.833
If you do, that's fine.

59:06.867 --> 59:10.104
I have to go pee anyway
for like 500th time today.

59:23.349 --> 59:24.751
Hey.

59:26.420 --> 59:28.989
Hi.

59:29.021 --> 59:30.924
You're upset or something?

59:30.958 --> 59:32.159
Just exhausted

59:32.192 --> 59:33.793
and it's like started
to move around,

59:33.827 --> 59:38.365
which is just like
the weirdest feeling imaginable.

59:38.398 --> 59:40.034
I asked her not to tell me.

59:42.135 --> 59:44.170
Really?

59:44.204 --> 59:45.506
Yeah.

59:45.539 --> 59:47.041
Uh, what do I care?

59:47.074 --> 59:49.143
I'm tryin' to parent
beyond pink and blue anyway.

59:50.978 --> 59:52.180
Thank you.

59:57.284 --> 59:59.854
So my lawyer friend finally
got the contract back to me

59:59.887 --> 01:00:02.389
and I thought
now is as good a time as any

01:00:02.422 --> 01:00:06.793
to hand it off to you.

01:00:06.827 --> 01:00:08.262
Are you like suddenly afraid

01:00:08.295 --> 01:00:10.197
I'm gonna steal this kid
from you?

01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:12.233
No,
I mean it protects you, too.

01:00:12.266 --> 01:00:15.536
If I go swimming in the Hudson
and contract a...

01:00:15.568 --> 01:00:20.039
a brain parasite, I can't
shelf this kid off on you.

01:00:20.072 --> 01:00:21.375
Anyway, you get those back
to me next month

01:00:21.407 --> 01:00:22.909
at the appointment.

01:00:22.943 --> 01:00:25.211
Yeah, yeah, I'm sure
I'll see you before then.

01:00:25.244 --> 01:00:26.346
Just uh, let me know.

01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:27.815
This week is crazy for me.

01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:33.954
Okay, yeah, I'll uh,
I'll see you soon, Roger.

01:00:40.893 --> 01:00:42.962
Chuck chuck to
Bustin, chuck chuck to Linn,

01:00:42.996 --> 01:00:46.133
Be careful little Lilah's
starting to fall in!

01:00:46.166 --> 01:00:46.901
- Oh!
- Oh.

01:00:46.934 --> 01:00:47.835
Okay, okay, okay.

01:00:47.869 --> 01:00:52.907
Who had uh, white people
like white people?

01:00:57.043 --> 01:00:59.045
Very good, very funny.

01:00:59.913 --> 01:01:01.014
I win.

01:01:01.047 --> 01:01:03.550
Um, I call it
"preferential treatment".

01:01:03.583 --> 01:01:07.153
If I was
giving preferential treatment,

01:01:07.186 --> 01:01:09.088
it would be to you.

01:01:10.257 --> 01:01:12.159
Oh please, they're cute.

01:01:12.192 --> 01:01:13.561
I wanna play charades.

01:01:13.594 --> 01:01:15.362
It's George's birthday.

01:01:15.394 --> 01:01:16.063
What do you wanna play?

01:01:16.096 --> 01:01:17.431
Yeah, I mean charades is good.

01:01:17.463 --> 01:01:19.166
Milo, are we still waiting
for Roger?

01:01:19.199 --> 01:01:20.334
Uh, I don't know,

01:01:20.367 --> 01:01:21.502
I don't know
if he's gonna make it.

01:01:21.534 --> 01:01:23.403
I am sure
we'll meet him eventually.

01:01:24.972 --> 01:01:26.473
Yeah.

01:01:26.505 --> 01:01:27.907
Uh, I mean he works nights
and he's about to have a baby,

01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:29.209
he's a really busy guy.

01:01:31.878 --> 01:01:33.213
Okay, are you getting fussy?

01:01:33.246 --> 01:01:33.914
I'm gonna
put her in right there.

01:01:33.947 --> 01:01:35.982
Sure, yeah, put here right in.

01:01:36.016 --> 01:01:38.052
Little bit of fussy girl.

01:01:41.188 --> 01:01:42.556
Uh, does anybody want anything
to drink?

01:01:42.588 --> 01:01:43.891
Oh, I'll have another Sixpoint.

01:01:43.923 --> 01:01:44.324
Thanks.

01:01:44.358 --> 01:01:45.593
Hmm.

01:01:51.664 --> 01:01:52.199
Shit.

01:01:52.231 --> 01:01:53.867
We're uh... we're out.

01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:56.103
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go out
and get some.

01:01:56.135 --> 01:01:57.403
No, don't worry about it.

01:01:57.436 --> 01:01:58.270
- No, we are fine.
- No, it's fine.

01:01:58.304 --> 01:02:00.540
Honestly,
I need the fresh air anyway.

01:02:41.581 --> 01:02:42.383
Thank you so much.

01:02:43.382 --> 01:02:45.151
Thank you so much.

01:02:45.184 --> 01:02:47.453
Jesus,
did you go to Alpha Centauri?

01:02:47.487 --> 01:02:49.088
You've been gone
like 35 minutes.

01:02:49.121 --> 01:02:51.291
Yeah, yeah,
the corner deli was closed.

01:02:57.097 --> 01:03:00.701
Alright, we gotta come up
with some words for charades.

01:03:00.733 --> 01:03:05.038
How about
some obscure legal Latin?

01:03:05.072 --> 01:03:08.041
Write "res ipsa loquitur".

01:03:08.074 --> 01:03:09.076
Ugh, amazing.

01:03:09.108 --> 01:03:09.943
I don't even know what that is.

01:03:09.976 --> 01:03:12.045
It goes without saying.

01:03:12.079 --> 01:03:14.682
I mean okay, it's... I don't...
I don't speak Latin.

01:03:14.715 --> 01:03:17.318
No, that's what it means,
"it goes without saying".

01:03:17.351 --> 01:03:20.521
Oh, right.

01:03:20.554 --> 01:03:22.056
Uh, speaking of Latin,
have you had a chance

01:03:22.088 --> 01:03:24.157
to look over my contract?

01:03:24.190 --> 01:03:27.226
Yeah, we should make some time
to talk about it.

01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:29.630
Okay, uh, we're here now.

01:03:29.663 --> 01:03:32.967
Yeah, but uh, I just had
a glass of wine and...

01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:36.603
It's more
than a five-minute conversation.

01:03:36.635 --> 01:03:39.239
Noor, I wasn't like asking you
to write me a legal brief

01:03:39.271 --> 01:03:40.641
I just...
I wanted you to look over it

01:03:40.673 --> 01:03:42.576
and make sure
everything seemed normal.

01:03:42.608 --> 01:03:44.177
Okay.

01:03:44.210 --> 01:03:46.179
Thank you.

01:03:55.789 --> 01:03:57.491
"The surrogate shall relinquish

01:03:57.523 --> 01:03:59.625
and the genetic father
shall take immediate, full,

01:03:59.659 --> 01:04:03.030
and absolute custody
of the child upon birth,

01:04:03.063 --> 01:04:05.432
and all decisions
concerning the child's health,

01:04:05.465 --> 01:04:07.434
in utero and after delivery,

01:04:07.467 --> 01:04:09.503
shall be made
by the genetic father."

01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:14.640
I'm worried that's
incredibly prohibitive language.

01:04:14.673 --> 01:04:18.045
No, it's just a technicality
that protects both of us.

01:04:18.077 --> 01:04:19.179
Okay.

01:04:22.349 --> 01:04:25.219
"Any child born pursuant
to the conduct

01:04:25.251 --> 01:04:28.087
contemplated by this agreement
shall be morally, ethically,

01:04:28.121 --> 01:04:30.324
legally, contractually,
and otherwise the child

01:04:30.356 --> 01:04:33.326
of the genetic father
for all purposes,

01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:36.163
the surrogate agrees to sign
all necessary affidavits,

01:04:36.195 --> 01:04:37.130
consents, and/or waivers,

01:04:37.164 --> 01:04:39.633
and to attend
all necessary court hearings

01:04:39.666 --> 01:04:41.501
to establish the genetic father's
parenthood to their prior...

01:04:41.534 --> 01:04:42.568
Okay. Okay, okay,
I get it.

01:04:42.601 --> 01:04:45.338
You made your point, Noor, okay?

01:04:45.371 --> 01:04:48.641
This doesn't sound like
a formality between friends.

01:04:48.675 --> 01:04:51.745
This sounds like someone who is
absolutely legally capable

01:04:51.777 --> 01:04:54.380
of preventing you
from seeing this baby forever

01:04:54.414 --> 01:04:55.215
if he wants to.

01:04:55.248 --> 01:04:56.450
No.

01:04:56.483 --> 01:04:58.818
No, he would
never do something like that.

01:04:58.851 --> 01:05:01.254
I'm not judging, Milo.

01:05:01.288 --> 01:05:04.458
These are reasonable questions
to ask.

01:05:04.490 --> 01:05:05.793
I don't even know
what he looks like.

01:05:05.826 --> 01:05:07.327
Uh, it's not
like you introduced us

01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:08.428
to your sperm donor.

01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:11.330
I also didn't drink whiskey
at his fucking house.

01:05:13.132 --> 01:05:15.068
Okay, look, I know how hard
it was for you to get pregnant

01:05:15.101 --> 01:05:16.369
and now I'm doing that
for someone else

01:05:16.402 --> 01:05:17.670
in your position.

01:05:17.704 --> 01:05:19.673
I just feel like can't you just
like be... be...

01:05:19.706 --> 01:05:21.575
What?

01:05:21.608 --> 01:05:23.243
Grateful?

01:05:23.275 --> 01:05:24.811
Were you gonna say "grateful"
to you?

01:05:24.844 --> 01:05:27.246
Like on behalf
of the gay community?

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:29.349
Yeah, we'll get your key
to Fire Island

01:05:29.382 --> 01:05:30.550
as soon as possible.

01:05:30.583 --> 01:05:32.385
Why are you being
such a shithead to me?

01:05:32.418 --> 01:05:35.121
Because you are
incapable of listening

01:05:35.155 --> 01:05:37.557
unless you're told exactly
what you wanna hear.

01:05:37.590 --> 01:05:39.157
KJ told me not to do this
and I still...

01:05:39.159 --> 01:05:40.794
Oh my God.

01:05:40.827 --> 01:05:42.529
What?

01:05:42.561 --> 01:05:44.163
You're a fucking lawyer, dude.

01:05:44.197 --> 01:05:45.833
It dr... it... honestly,
it drives me insane

01:05:45.865 --> 01:05:47.733
when you act
like some diffident housewife.

01:05:47.766 --> 01:05:49.435
Like... like if KJ were a dude,

01:05:49.469 --> 01:05:51.472
she would be the picture
of an overbearing boyfriend.

01:05:51.505 --> 01:05:53.474
Like your wife
let you do your actual job.

01:05:53.507 --> 01:05:54.740
I'm sorry welcome
to the 21st fucking century.

01:05:54.773 --> 01:05:57.743
She didn't let me do anything.

01:05:57.777 --> 01:05:59.780
- Marriage is a partnership.
- Hmm.

01:05:59.813 --> 01:06:01.748
Yes, I run major decisions
by my wife.

01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:02.748
Oh, oh, cool.

01:06:02.782 --> 01:06:04.117
I had no idea

01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:04.984
that giving your best friend
legal advice

01:06:05.018 --> 01:06:07.153
constituted
as a major life decision.

01:06:07.186 --> 01:06:08.454
It shouldn't be,

01:06:08.487 --> 01:06:11.424
but you always end up
mental gymnasticsing me

01:06:11.458 --> 01:06:12.659
and it's fucking exhausting,
Milo!

01:06:12.692 --> 01:06:14.193
Yes, because one minute

01:06:14.226 --> 01:06:15.528
you're the moral authority
of the world...

01:06:15.561 --> 01:06:16.896
Oh!

01:06:16.929 --> 01:06:17.864
And the next you're
the fucking victim.

01:06:17.898 --> 01:06:20.534
Yeah, that's called
"having a conscience"!

01:06:21.467 --> 01:06:23.870
Okay.

01:06:23.903 --> 01:06:25.806
You know how when you ask people
about their childhood friends

01:06:25.838 --> 01:06:26.974
and they're always like,
"You know,

01:06:27.007 --> 01:06:29.476
if we met each other now,
we just we'd never be friends,

01:06:29.509 --> 01:06:31.811
but we've known each other
for so long."

01:06:31.844 --> 01:06:33.713
Noor, I never thought
that was us, but...

01:06:38.818 --> 01:06:41.455
No, 'cause I think cacti
is plural for cactus.

01:06:41.487 --> 01:06:42.355
Ooh.

01:06:43.889 --> 01:06:45.025
- Oh, that's a good one.
- Oh, no, no, we're not done yet.

01:06:45.057 --> 01:06:47.161
I'm sorry, guys, I'm just...
I'm not feeling that well.

01:06:47.193 --> 01:06:48.394
I think
I'm just gonna head home.

01:06:49.929 --> 01:06:50.830
- Are you okay?
- You haven't even had cake.

01:06:50.864 --> 01:06:52.199
Are you seriously leaving?

01:06:52.231 --> 01:06:53.900
Yeah, I am!

01:06:55.635 --> 01:06:57.337
We got into an argument
and now she's like running home.

01:06:58.237 --> 01:06:59.204
Okay,
can we all just keep it down?

01:06:59.239 --> 01:07:01.775
I am speaking at
a perfectly reasonable volume!

01:07:01.807 --> 01:07:04.378
It's a baby, fucking Christ,
that's what it does.

01:07:04.411 --> 01:07:06.480
Yeah, I actually had a kid
with the full knowledge

01:07:06.512 --> 01:07:08.215
and understanding
of what a commitment that is.

01:07:08.248 --> 01:07:09.349
Right, yes.

01:07:09.382 --> 01:07:09.916
In retrospect,
I really should have come

01:07:09.949 --> 01:07:12.418
to you for advice KJ.

01:07:12.452 --> 01:07:14.388
You know what, Milo,
you are incapable of listening

01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:16.789
unless you are told exactly
what you wanna hear.

01:07:19.226 --> 01:07:20.928
Do you two just
like sit up at night

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:22.762
and talk about me
instead of having sex?

01:07:22.795 --> 01:07:23.931
Milo.

01:07:23.963 --> 01:07:25.065
Can you not swear
in front of the baby?

01:07:25.099 --> 01:07:26.200
No, no, no, no, I'm s...
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

01:07:26.233 --> 01:07:29.202
I shouldn't say "sex"
in front of the fucking baby!

01:07:29.235 --> 01:07:30.003
- Let's just go.
- Alright.

01:07:30.036 --> 01:07:31.270
- Come on, let's just go.
- Yeah.

01:07:31.304 --> 01:07:31.972
It's not worth it.

01:07:33.273 --> 01:07:33.874
Wait, you can't push open...

01:07:34.974 --> 01:07:36.509
Definitely, go home
and send me the therapy bill

01:07:36.543 --> 01:07:37.844
in 15 years, okay? That's fine.

01:07:38.878 --> 01:07:39.580
Come on. No, no, no.

01:07:39.612 --> 01:07:40.114
Just... yeah.

01:07:41.614 --> 01:07:44.650
Okay, but like I'm mostly mad
that I just...

01:07:44.684 --> 01:07:46.853
I feel like I can't have
a single conversation with her

01:07:46.885 --> 01:07:49.456
without like a specter of KJ
just like hanging over.

01:07:49.489 --> 01:07:50.389
You know what I mean?

01:07:50.422 --> 01:07:51.691
Noor loves you.

01:07:51.724 --> 01:07:53.559
Not as much as she loves KJ,
no ma...

01:07:53.592 --> 01:07:55.295
No matter how unreasonable
she's being.

01:07:55.327 --> 01:07:56.630
They're married.

01:07:58.530 --> 01:08:00.266
Sorry, can I have another wine,
please?

01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:01.501
Hey, Milo,

01:08:01.534 --> 01:08:03.237
you know I'm never one
to police a good time,

01:08:03.269 --> 01:08:04.605
but should you maybe slow down?

01:08:04.637 --> 01:08:07.373
George, it's fine.

01:08:07.407 --> 01:08:08.809
Um,
I think if you just apologize,

01:08:08.842 --> 01:08:10.309
it'll probably work itself out.

01:08:10.342 --> 01:08:12.245
- Okay, are you like on her side?
- No, I...

01:08:12.278 --> 01:08:15.514
Hey, neither of us
even heard the argument.

01:08:15.547 --> 01:08:18.652
I think she's
just worried about you.

01:08:18.685 --> 01:08:19.920
Do you think she needs to be?

01:08:19.953 --> 01:08:21.455
No, I think it's a little weird

01:08:21.488 --> 01:08:23.356
that you're
in this new relationship

01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:24.791
that seems good for you,

01:08:24.823 --> 01:08:25.992
but you spend so much time
with Roger

01:08:26.024 --> 01:08:28.627
and none of us
have even met him.

01:08:28.662 --> 01:08:30.462
Yeah, okay, well,
he's like literally on his way

01:08:30.497 --> 01:08:31.331
to come meet us right now,

01:08:31.363 --> 01:08:32.064
so why don't you
take a picture of him

01:08:32.099 --> 01:08:32.865
and just send it to Noor, okay?

01:08:44.577 --> 01:08:45.612
Hi, you've reached Roger.

01:08:45.645 --> 01:08:46.846
I'm not here right now.

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:47.948
Leave me a message
and I'll get back to you

01:08:47.979 --> 01:08:48.881
as soon as I can.

01:08:50.317 --> 01:08:52.519
Hey, it's me uh, again.

01:08:52.551 --> 01:08:54.720
I'm at phoenix and I'm just...

01:08:54.752 --> 01:08:56.354
I'm starting
to get a little worried,

01:08:56.389 --> 01:08:57.457
because it's been
a couple of hours

01:08:57.488 --> 01:08:58.858
and I still haven't
heard from you.

01:08:58.890 --> 01:09:00.027
Um...

01:09:02.729 --> 01:09:05.832
And I've been
feeling some cramps,

01:09:05.863 --> 01:09:08.335
and like a few sharper pains
in my sides,

01:09:08.368 --> 01:09:09.803
and I don't know
if it's anything.

01:09:09.836 --> 01:09:11.971
Anyway, yeah, I um...

01:09:14.872 --> 01:09:16.042
...I just wanted
to keep you posted.

01:09:16.076 --> 01:09:18.845
So yeah, you...
you know where to find me.

01:09:18.877 --> 01:09:20.014
Uh...

01:09:33.024 --> 01:09:33.926
Oh yeah.

01:09:37.630 --> 01:09:39.497
- Okay.
- Ooh yeah.

01:09:39.532 --> 01:09:41.335
Hey, are you okay?

01:09:41.368 --> 01:09:42.435
Is everything alright?

01:09:42.469 --> 01:09:43.703
What? Oh, yeah.

01:09:43.737 --> 01:09:44.671
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:44.703 --> 01:09:47.106
Um, uh, Roger, this is George,
my roommate,

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:49.576
and his recurring
Tinder date Teddy.

01:09:49.609 --> 01:09:50.410
It's really good to see you.

01:09:50.443 --> 01:09:52.444
It's been a minute, huh?

01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:54.014
Uh, wait, are you drinking?

01:09:54.046 --> 01:09:54.780
I had some wine.

01:09:54.814 --> 01:09:56.048
Yeah, one is fine.

01:09:56.082 --> 01:09:57.117
Alright.

01:09:57.149 --> 01:09:58.751
You sure everything's okay?

01:09:58.784 --> 01:10:00.386
Why wouldn't it be?

01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:01.421
Milo said
she was having stomach pains.

01:10:01.454 --> 01:10:02.956
Oh my God,
why didn't you tell me?

01:10:02.988 --> 01:10:04.557
Uh, they passed.

01:10:04.591 --> 01:10:05.492
Seriously, I'm fine.

01:10:05.524 --> 01:10:06.425
It... it wasn't a big deal.

01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:07.860
I just... I almost
didn't even mention it.

01:10:07.894 --> 01:10:09.396
It's fine.

01:10:09.429 --> 01:10:11.364
You called me and asked me
to come be with you.

01:10:11.398 --> 01:10:13.766
No, I wasn't like...

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:15.702
Seriously, I just said that
in passing, okay?

01:10:15.734 --> 01:10:17.603
I... I was just calling to see
if you wanted to come meet us

01:10:17.636 --> 01:10:19.372
for a drink?

01:10:19.405 --> 01:10:22.376
Okay, I'm gonna head back home.

01:10:22.408 --> 01:10:24.143
I'm uh, glad everything's okay.

01:10:24.176 --> 01:10:25.644
No, come on,
you're already here.

01:10:25.677 --> 01:10:28.381
Let me just
buy you a whiskey soda.

01:10:28.414 --> 01:10:29.783
I don't even
have my wallet on me.

01:10:29.815 --> 01:10:31.016
W...

01:10:31.050 --> 01:10:33.087
I'll see you at the appointment
next week.

01:10:38.757 --> 01:10:39.893
Sorry.

01:10:39.926 --> 01:10:41.061
I... I really... I... ooh,
I do not know

01:10:41.094 --> 01:10:41.895
what that was about.

01:10:41.927 --> 01:10:43.162
Phew.

01:10:43.195 --> 01:10:44.797
Thank God,
men can't get pregnant.

01:10:46.198 --> 01:10:49.603
'Cause I mean Jesus the f...
fucking volatility.

01:10:51.570 --> 01:10:53.073
I'm gonna call it a night.

01:10:53.105 --> 01:10:54.541
No, wait, George.

01:10:54.573 --> 01:10:55.174
Come on, please stay.

01:10:55.207 --> 01:10:56.143
I need to be distracted.

01:10:56.176 --> 01:10:58.512
Hey, George, what is wrong?

01:10:58.545 --> 01:11:00.514
It's my birthday,

01:11:00.546 --> 01:11:02.715
and this is the first time I've
asked Teddy to come hang out

01:11:02.748 --> 01:11:04.583
with all of us,
and now I feel like he thinks

01:11:04.617 --> 01:11:05.918
I have a crazy dramatic group
of friends.

01:11:05.952 --> 01:11:07.454
This is Noor.

01:11:07.487 --> 01:11:09.590
Honestly, I don't really care
whose fault it is.

01:11:20.667 --> 01:11:22.002
Hi.

01:11:52.631 --> 01:11:55.835
I really genuinely
feel like five years ago,

01:11:55.868 --> 01:11:57.470
conspiracy theories
were the glue

01:11:57.503 --> 01:11:58.471
that bound us all together

01:11:58.505 --> 01:11:59.538
and now it's like someone's
conspiracy theory

01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:03.243
So delicate yet so strong.

01:12:03.275 --> 01:12:05.511
I wish Milo would shut up.

01:12:05.545 --> 01:12:08.081
Hmm.

01:12:08.113 --> 01:12:08.781
Milo.

01:12:09.282 --> 01:12:10.250
Milo.

01:12:10.283 --> 01:12:10.850
And it honestly drives me crazy
like every...

01:12:10.884 --> 01:12:11.283
- Milo.
- What?

01:12:11.317 --> 01:12:12.018
Could you just...

01:12:12.051 --> 01:12:14.554
Could you just please be quiet?

01:12:14.587 --> 01:12:16.690
Yeah, it's becoming
increasingly difficult

01:12:16.722 --> 01:12:18.725
just to sit here
and enjoy the music.

01:12:18.757 --> 01:12:19.925
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:12:19.958 --> 01:12:21.060
You mean you...
oh, you want me to be quiet

01:12:21.094 --> 01:12:22.229
like um, this?

01:12:22.261 --> 01:12:23.697
Just like sit here, quiet.

01:12:25.597 --> 01:12:29.269
It's just that for once we have
a talented semi-famous musician

01:12:29.301 --> 01:12:30.804
playing an instrument,

01:12:30.837 --> 01:12:35.141
whereas we get to listen
to you talk for hours on end

01:12:35.173 --> 01:12:37.511
literally every day.

01:12:37.543 --> 01:12:40.747
Um, hi, hello, yes, I... I'm um,
I'm a musician, too.

01:12:42.015 --> 01:12:46.920
Yeah, but thing is like you're
not really though, are you?

01:12:46.953 --> 01:12:48.688
Yeah,
you haven't played an open mic

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:50.656
since you started working here,
so...

01:12:52.859 --> 01:12:54.261
Hey,
some of my friends are playing

01:12:54.293 --> 01:12:56.262
at the Knitting Factory tonight
if you wanna come?

01:12:56.296 --> 01:12:56.997
I think you'd like them.

01:12:57.029 --> 01:12:58.498
- The Knitting Factory.
- Got it.

01:13:05.704 --> 01:13:07.039
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, what?

01:13:07.073 --> 01:13:08.208
Tonight.

01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:10.676
You wanna come to a show
with me?

01:13:10.710 --> 01:13:11.944
Uh, no, I can't, I can't.

01:13:11.978 --> 01:13:13.747
I'm... I'm doing something
with Roger.

01:13:13.779 --> 01:13:16.015
I'm sorry, but we're on
for Saturday, yeah?

01:13:16.048 --> 01:13:17.317
Yeah, sure.

01:13:17.350 --> 01:13:18.084
- I'll see you later.
- Bye.

01:13:19.018 --> 01:13:19.519
Uh...

01:13:26.024 --> 01:13:26.726
That's mine, too.

01:13:27.827 --> 01:13:28.795
Bye.

01:13:28.828 --> 01:13:30.130
The Knitting
Factory tonight, man.

01:13:30.162 --> 01:13:31.097
The Knitting Factory.

01:13:31.131 --> 01:13:32.231
The Knitting Factory,
I didn't get a kiss.

01:13:32.265 --> 01:13:33.967
Nope.

01:13:58.757 --> 01:14:00.193
Milo, what are you doing here?

01:14:00.225 --> 01:14:02.127
I was just uh, stopping by
on my way home from work.

01:14:02.161 --> 01:14:02.994
I wanted to ask you about the...

01:14:03.029 --> 01:14:04.864
Yeah, now is not a good time,
so...

01:14:04.896 --> 01:14:05.332
Hi.

01:14:05.364 --> 01:14:05.765
Hi.

01:14:06.765 --> 01:14:07.634
I'm Ken.

01:14:08.635 --> 01:14:09.703
Hi.

01:14:09.735 --> 01:14:12.171
Uh, Ken, uh, this is Milo.

01:14:12.204 --> 01:14:13.073
You're Milo.

01:14:13.105 --> 01:14:13.672
Yeah.

01:14:13.707 --> 01:14:17.043
It is nice to meet you.

01:14:17.076 --> 01:14:19.244
Ken, I'm... I'm really...
I'm sorry to crash the party.

01:14:19.278 --> 01:14:21.715
I d... I didn't... I didn't know
you had anyone over.

01:14:21.747 --> 01:14:22.848
I hope you don't
think it's weird,

01:14:22.882 --> 01:14:25.784
but I just wanna tell you
it is such a wonderful thing

01:14:25.818 --> 01:14:27.119
that you're doing.

01:14:27.153 --> 01:14:28.387
You know, all the dads
in our group were so touched

01:14:28.421 --> 01:14:30.222
when we heard the story.

01:14:30.256 --> 01:14:32.292
Oh, you're...
you're in the dad group, too?

01:14:32.324 --> 01:14:33.393
Uh, that... that's awesome.

01:14:33.426 --> 01:14:33.927
Do you have kids?

01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:36.395
Yeah, Lyla, she's 4.

01:14:36.429 --> 01:14:39.032
Uh, I can't believe
I haven't met you yet.

01:14:39.064 --> 01:14:40.799
Have you been
to any of Roger's shows?

01:14:40.832 --> 01:14:42.134
Not yet,

01:14:42.167 --> 01:14:44.003
but I hear he's
the belle of the ball, though.

01:14:44.037 --> 01:14:45.704
He is, you should come sometime.

01:14:45.738 --> 01:14:46.506
Uh, we could sit together

01:14:46.538 --> 01:14:48.007
and we'd get you
a sunset surprise.

01:14:48.041 --> 01:14:50.176
Yeah, I'm...
I'm not on this week,

01:14:50.208 --> 01:14:52.045
but um, maybe sometime.

01:14:52.078 --> 01:14:53.880
Sure.

01:14:55.247 --> 01:14:57.082
Well, I... I'd offer you
a glass of wine, but...

01:14:57.850 --> 01:14:58.651
Yeah, that's fine, that's fine.

01:14:58.684 --> 01:15:00.686
Um, I'm seeing Milo
later this week.

01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:02.122
I'll uh, Milo, let me...
let me walk you down.

01:15:04.256 --> 01:15:06.058
It's uh, nice to meet you, Ken.

01:15:11.396 --> 01:15:13.099
I had no idea you were
seeing someone.

01:15:13.131 --> 01:15:14.967
Yeah, I have been for a while.

01:15:15.001 --> 01:15:16.036
Why didn't you say anything?

01:15:16.069 --> 01:15:18.038
Because it just
didn't seem relevant.

01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:19.439
Relevant to... to what?

01:15:19.471 --> 01:15:23.777
Milo, you need to text me
before you come over.

01:15:23.810 --> 01:15:25.278
You know if anything's happening
with the baby,

01:15:25.310 --> 01:15:27.746
I'm here day or night.

01:15:27.779 --> 01:15:30.315
Otherwise, we need to
start setting some boundaries.

01:15:30.349 --> 01:15:31.317
Okay.

01:15:31.350 --> 01:15:33.353
Alright. So what um...

01:15:33.386 --> 01:15:35.955
What are our boundaries then,
Roger?

01:15:35.988 --> 01:15:37.923
I'll honestly feel better
about our boundaries

01:15:37.957 --> 01:15:40.060
when you return the contract.

01:15:40.092 --> 01:15:42.929
Okay, I... I mean I... I just...

01:15:42.962 --> 01:15:44.030
I saw
that you were home tonight,

01:15:44.063 --> 01:15:46.399
so I figured I'd stop by
on my walk home.

01:15:46.431 --> 01:15:47.300
How'd you even know I was home?

01:15:47.332 --> 01:15:48.967
You posted a picture.

01:15:49.001 --> 01:15:50.170
Okay, this...
this is what I'm talking about.

01:15:51.203 --> 01:15:51.970
I should be able
to post something

01:15:52.003 --> 01:15:53.273
on a personal account

01:15:53.305 --> 01:15:55.774
without you taking it
as an open invitation

01:15:55.807 --> 01:15:56.809
to drop in
whenever you feel like it,

01:15:56.842 --> 01:15:57.943
like it's an episode of Friends
or something.

01:15:57.976 --> 01:15:59.078
It's a public account.

01:15:59.112 --> 01:16:01.081
I didn't like pay someone

01:16:01.113 --> 01:16:02.881
to track down
your social security number

01:16:02.914 --> 01:16:04.717
and your mother's maiden name
for me.

01:16:04.751 --> 01:16:06.052
No,
but you are taking photos of me

01:16:06.085 --> 01:16:06.752
through my window.

01:16:06.786 --> 01:16:07.386
That was a joke.

01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:08.822
It was weird, Milo!

01:16:08.854 --> 01:16:10.222
It made me feel weird.

01:16:10.256 --> 01:16:12.792
And then, the whole telling me
you had stomach pains

01:16:12.824 --> 01:16:14.461
to get me to go hang out
with you at a bar!

01:16:14.493 --> 01:16:16.996
My stomach did feel weird,
Roger, okay?

01:16:17.029 --> 01:16:19.199
I... I mean I'm not like insane.

01:16:19.231 --> 01:16:20.432
You're making me sound
like I'm insane

01:16:20.466 --> 01:16:23.403
or like I'm stalking you
or something.

01:16:23.435 --> 01:16:26.773
You know how wonderful
I think you are.

01:16:26.805 --> 01:16:30.275
I am so fucking excited
that this kid is gonna

01:16:30.309 --> 01:16:32.811
have your awesome genes.

01:16:32.845 --> 01:16:35.148
If she's half as badass as you,
she's gonna do okay

01:16:35.180 --> 01:16:36.048
in this insane difficult world.

01:16:36.082 --> 01:16:39.252
She?

01:16:39.284 --> 01:16:40.819
Shit.

01:16:40.853 --> 01:16:41.855
- You said that you didn't find out.
- Shit.

01:16:41.887 --> 01:16:42.387
Milo, I'm sorry.

01:16:42.421 --> 01:16:43.021
I w...

01:16:43.989 --> 01:16:46.391
I wanted to know.

01:16:46.425 --> 01:16:48.328
I just... like I really...
I really fucking wanted

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:50.130
to keep this one thing
for myself.

01:16:51.863 --> 01:16:52.831
I'm sorry I told you.

01:16:52.864 --> 01:16:55.501
It... it was shitty,
but it was an accident.

01:16:55.534 --> 01:16:59.905
I'm not sorry for wanting
to know the gender of my child.

01:16:59.939 --> 01:17:02.809
I've been waiting for this
for 20 years!

01:17:02.841 --> 01:17:04.943
Right, so I'm... I'm...
I'm just your surrogate.

01:17:06.878 --> 01:17:09.448
Is that the way you talk
about me in your dad group?

01:17:09.481 --> 01:17:11.451
No.

01:17:11.484 --> 01:17:13.486
I just need you
to let me figure out

01:17:13.519 --> 01:17:15.989
how to be a dad on my own.

01:17:39.845 --> 01:17:42.147
Hey, um, do you wanna...
do you wanna go

01:17:42.180 --> 01:17:45.150
to Rogers um, show
at Thigh High tonight just...

01:17:45.184 --> 01:17:47.320
Just the two of us?

01:17:47.353 --> 01:17:50.088
Um, I'm supposed to
spend the night at Teddy's,

01:17:50.122 --> 01:17:53.927
but yeah, I'm down.

01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:56.128
Tinder Teddy still?

01:17:56.162 --> 01:17:57.864
Yeah, it's been like six months.

01:17:57.896 --> 01:18:01.835
George, are you mad at me?

01:18:01.868 --> 01:18:03.837
No, just naked.

01:18:09.341 --> 01:18:10.175
Are you done yet?

01:18:10.208 --> 01:18:12.345
Uh, yeah, sorry, shit.

01:18:12.377 --> 01:18:14.113
Uh, okay.

01:18:16.414 --> 01:18:17.951
Whoops.

01:18:19.351 --> 01:18:20.420
- Don't flush the toi...
- Sorry, shit, sorry!

01:18:24.489 --> 01:18:27.860
Ooh, I am sure your daddy
will be able to teach you

01:18:27.894 --> 01:18:30.197
to do makeup
much better than I can.

01:18:36.569 --> 01:18:38.204
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:18:38.237 --> 01:18:39.137
What's up?

01:18:39.171 --> 01:18:40.939
There should be a special place
in hell

01:18:40.972 --> 01:18:42.542
for people
who organize supermarkets.

01:18:42.574 --> 01:18:44.476
Oh no!

01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:45.445
Yeah, you're welcome,

01:18:45.478 --> 01:18:47.547
I'm makin' you
a goddamn stuffed artichoke.

01:18:50.181 --> 01:18:52.484
Um, you're gonna kill me.

01:18:52.518 --> 01:18:54.453
If you tell me
I'm only making one stuffed artichoke.

01:18:54.487 --> 01:18:55.520
Yeah, I might.

01:18:55.554 --> 01:18:57.190
I totally forgot.

01:18:57.789 --> 01:18:58.957
Did you make other plans?

01:18:58.990 --> 01:18:59.824
No.

01:18:59.859 --> 01:19:01.995
No, no, no,
Roger has a show tonight,

01:19:02.028 --> 01:19:04.396
and we had a really weird night
this week,

01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:07.233
and I wanna go, and try,
and sort things over.

01:19:07.265 --> 01:19:09.469
Please, please, please, please,
come and then you know,

01:19:09.502 --> 01:19:11.571
we can go back to your place
right after.

01:19:11.604 --> 01:19:13.472
We planned this like a week ago.

01:19:13.506 --> 01:19:15.173
I know, I know, I'm sorry.

01:19:15.207 --> 01:19:19.112
I... I'll be in and out,
I promise.

01:19:19.145 --> 01:19:20.980
I'll give you a head.

01:19:21.012 --> 01:19:23.248
Don't try to negotiate sex
for food.

01:19:24.617 --> 01:19:26.185
Okay, uh, meet me there.

01:19:26.217 --> 01:19:27.653
I'll text you the address.

01:19:27.686 --> 01:19:28.320
Bye.

01:19:28.354 --> 01:19:29.288
Bye.

01:19:35.493 --> 01:19:36.561
Shit.

01:19:46.738 --> 01:19:47.940
Did you invite Cameron?

01:19:47.974 --> 01:19:49.342
Yeah.

01:19:49.375 --> 01:19:51.077
Sorry, I forgot we were supposed
to have date night,

01:19:51.109 --> 01:19:53.313
so I told him
to come meet us here.

01:19:53.345 --> 01:19:54.413
Okay, I'm gonna get a drink.

01:19:54.447 --> 01:19:55.382
Okay.

01:19:59.518 --> 01:20:00.586
Hello.

01:20:00.618 --> 01:20:01.954
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:20:01.988 --> 01:20:03.088
- How are you?
- Good, good, good.

01:20:03.122 --> 01:20:04.390
Uh, let's go get seats.

01:20:06.225 --> 01:20:07.193
Milo.

01:20:07.225 --> 01:20:08.560
Jesus, hi!

01:20:08.594 --> 01:20:09.529
Does Roger know you're here?

01:20:09.561 --> 01:20:10.395
Uh, no, no, no,

01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:12.164
I didn't even know
he was performing.

01:20:12.198 --> 01:20:12.832
Hey, come.

01:20:12.865 --> 01:20:13.733
Come, come, sit at the bar.

01:20:13.765 --> 01:20:14.533
No, no, no,
we're gonna go find seats.

01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:24.109
Never been
to a drag show before.

01:20:24.143 --> 01:20:25.578
Yes, why is that?

01:20:30.149 --> 01:20:31.284
No, I don't know.

01:20:31.317 --> 01:20:33.019
I just... like you're like
you did some work

01:20:33.051 --> 01:20:35.220
and they let you... give you
a rogue strap

01:20:35.253 --> 01:20:37.390
and take you to a drag show.

01:20:37.422 --> 01:20:39.091
I must have missed
that day of orientation.

01:20:39.125 --> 01:20:40.259
Sucks to be you.

01:20:56.274 --> 01:20:58.478
Fun little fact for y'all.

01:20:58.511 --> 01:21:01.647
Suppository
is actually my drag auntie

01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:03.048
and I don't know

01:21:03.082 --> 01:21:05.084
if you're allowed
to fuck your drag aunt,

01:21:05.117 --> 01:21:08.287
but if Game of Thrones
tells us anything,

01:21:08.319 --> 01:21:12.090
and it does, it's yes, mama!

01:21:13.391 --> 01:21:14.460
Ooh!

01:21:15.394 --> 01:21:19.332
Next up
is my personal favorite DILTF

01:21:19.364 --> 01:21:21.134
that stands for "Daddy,
I'd like to find

01:21:21.167 --> 01:21:22.535
an amazing family therapist

01:21:22.568 --> 01:21:24.404
to work through
our deep-seated issues with."

01:21:25.570 --> 01:21:28.440
Angela Merkin!

01:21:31.109 --> 01:21:32.744
Hello, hello, guys and dolls,

01:21:32.778 --> 01:21:35.213
I've been reading
a lot of baby books lately

01:21:35.247 --> 01:21:39.118
and they all tell me that
gender is a social construct

01:21:39.150 --> 01:21:40.787
and that all of us
should be playing with dolls,

01:21:40.819 --> 01:21:42.788
so apparently,
I am the modern picture

01:21:42.822 --> 01:21:44.056
of the perfect parent.

01:21:44.090 --> 01:21:44.657
Wooh!

01:21:46.257 --> 01:21:47.025
Yes,
I'm sure your mother's very proud.

01:21:49.194 --> 01:21:51.130
This one goes out
to all the daddies out there,

01:21:51.162 --> 01:21:54.733
but it is dedicated
to one very special daddy,

01:21:54.766 --> 01:21:55.734
my Kenny.

01:21:55.768 --> 01:21:56.702
Aw!

01:21:59.738 --> 01:22:00.606
Hit it, Sam.

01:22:10.582 --> 01:22:13.752
♪ Somebody said
you got a new friend ♪

01:22:20.859 --> 01:22:23.261
That was some show.

01:22:23.295 --> 01:22:24.730
Uh, yeah, he's great, right?

01:22:24.762 --> 01:22:26.364
Milo,
can I talk to you a second?

01:22:26.398 --> 01:22:27.634
Yep.

01:22:30.235 --> 01:22:32.371
Did you not tell Roger
we were comin' here tonight?

01:22:32.404 --> 01:22:33.873
Ugh, chill, George, it's fine.

01:22:33.905 --> 01:22:34.539
Are you okay?

01:22:34.573 --> 01:22:35.207
Yes!

01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:37.275
Like are you actually okay?

01:22:37.309 --> 01:22:39.412
Because this is all startin'
to get really weird

01:22:39.444 --> 01:22:41.179
and you're bein'
like a little manic.

01:22:42.148 --> 01:22:43.181
Okay, yeah, let's uh,

01:22:43.215 --> 01:22:44.182
let's all remember
which one of us

01:22:44.216 --> 01:22:46.586
is medicated for that.

01:22:46.618 --> 01:22:47.719
Wow.

01:22:49.387 --> 01:22:51.423
If you wanna light yourself
on fire, Milo,

01:22:51.457 --> 01:22:54.727
that's up to you,
but I'm not gonna stand here

01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:57.130
and burn up next to you.

01:22:57.162 --> 01:22:59.865
Is that like a little... little
therapy tidbit you filed away?

01:22:59.899 --> 01:23:01.467
I'm sorry for
not taking relationship advice

01:23:01.500 --> 01:23:02.667
from someone
who has literally cheated

01:23:02.701 --> 01:23:04.537
on every person he's been with.

01:23:11.644 --> 01:23:12.211
You okay?

01:23:12.244 --> 01:23:13.845
Yes, I'm fine.

01:23:13.878 --> 01:23:15.314
You don't have to stay here.

01:23:15.346 --> 01:23:16.547
You're supposed
to go to my place tonight.

01:23:16.582 --> 01:23:18.317
I know, I...
it's important that I talk to Roger.

01:23:18.350 --> 01:23:19.819
- What?
- What are you doing here?

01:23:19.851 --> 01:23:21.153
Stopping by the performance

01:23:21.186 --> 01:23:22.622
that wasn't happening
this weekend.

01:23:22.654 --> 01:23:23.456
What are you talking about?

01:23:23.488 --> 01:23:25.423
Last week,
when I was at your house,

01:23:25.457 --> 01:23:27.226
you told me
that you weren't on tonight.

01:23:27.259 --> 01:23:29.595
I am allowed to have a life
that doesn't involve you.

01:23:29.627 --> 01:23:30.795
Oh, okay.

01:23:30.828 --> 01:23:31.929
I'm just... I'm just tryin'
to figure out

01:23:31.963 --> 01:23:34.266
how we went from taking shots
in your dressing room

01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:36.302
to arguing on a street corner.

01:23:36.335 --> 01:23:39.172
We... we were... no, we were fine
like... like a month ago.

01:23:39.204 --> 01:23:41.407
This is not the life I want
for my kid.

01:23:43.442 --> 01:23:46.645
This is a check for $13,000.

01:23:46.679 --> 01:23:47.779
It's most of my savings.

01:23:47.813 --> 01:23:49.248
I'm gonna be very clear.

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:49.916
This is a transaction.

01:23:49.948 --> 01:23:50.582
No.

01:23:50.617 --> 01:23:52.284
No, it is what I say it is.

01:23:52.318 --> 01:23:53.753
I'm fucking pregnant.

01:23:53.786 --> 01:23:56.655
Roger, you... you manipulated me
into thinking

01:23:56.689 --> 01:23:58.191
that we were friends.

01:23:58.224 --> 01:24:00.626
Is this what a friendship
looks like to you?

01:24:00.658 --> 01:24:01.460
Do what you want with that.

01:24:01.493 --> 01:24:03.629
Deposit it or don't,
I don't care,

01:24:03.662 --> 01:24:06.199
but you better return
those papers signed

01:24:06.231 --> 01:24:07.432
by the end of next week

01:24:07.466 --> 01:24:09.536
or I will make it
a fucking problem for you.

01:24:19.877 --> 01:24:22.547
Uh, I think you should go
to your own place tonight.

01:24:22.581 --> 01:24:23.716
Are you serious?

01:24:23.748 --> 01:24:25.451
Because of Roger?

01:24:25.484 --> 01:24:27.620
No, Milo, because of you.

01:24:27.653 --> 01:24:28.454
You keep blowin' me off
for someone

01:24:28.487 --> 01:24:30.456
who clearly
doesn't want you around.

01:24:30.488 --> 01:24:32.692
It is a really,
really complicated situation.

01:24:32.725 --> 01:24:34.527
I don't doubt that.

01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:36.796
But whether you
keep misrepresenting it to me,

01:24:36.828 --> 01:24:38.463
yourself or both.

01:24:38.497 --> 01:24:39.731
Cameron, will you please just
like chill for five minutes?

01:24:39.765 --> 01:24:40.967
I'll see you.

01:25:00.586 --> 01:25:01.721
Hey, it's Noor.

01:25:01.753 --> 01:25:03.288
Leave me a message,
I'll call you back.

01:25:06.759 --> 01:25:07.659
Hey, it's Noor.

Leave me a message,
I'll call you back.

Please, call me.

01:25:13.564 --> 01:25:14.833
I'm really sorry.

01:25:14.867 --> 01:25:15.835
I know that I was out of line
the other night

01:25:15.868 --> 01:25:18.638
and I'm... I'm sorry, Noor.

01:25:18.671 --> 01:25:19.972
I really...

01:25:20.005 --> 01:25:22.807

please call me back.

Hi.

01:27:30.002 --> 01:27:31.804
Hi.

01:27:31.837 --> 01:27:35.541
I... I promise I'm not...
I'm not tryin' to trap you.

01:27:35.573 --> 01:27:37.108
Just drinking
with my name sake?

01:27:37.141 --> 01:27:39.578
Oh, yeah, yeah,
he does okay in a pinch.

01:27:43.181 --> 01:27:45.917
Okay, uh I...

01:27:45.951 --> 01:27:47.787
I think you're feeling
like I've been an asshole

01:27:47.819 --> 01:27:50.088
who is completely preoccupied
with my own life

01:27:50.122 --> 01:27:53.626
and I am feeling
like I have been an asshole

01:27:53.658 --> 01:27:55.862
who is completely preoccupied
with my own life.

01:27:58.831 --> 01:28:00.132
You see, I can do therapy, too.

01:28:03.801 --> 01:28:06.639
I printed out a list of um,
of all the questions

01:28:06.671 --> 01:28:08.773
I wish I had asked you
over the past seven months.

01:28:08.806 --> 01:28:09.775
Please sit.

01:28:17.515 --> 01:28:18.750
Good.

01:28:20.618 --> 01:28:22.720
How's the sex with Teddy?

01:28:22.753 --> 01:28:24.756
Our DM says it's fantastic.

01:28:24.789 --> 01:28:25.791
Huh-huh.

01:28:25.823 --> 01:28:27.460
If you could be
any dessert wine,

01:28:27.493 --> 01:28:28.894
which one would you be?

01:28:28.926 --> 01:28:30.762
Dessert wine is for people
who don't value themselves.

01:28:30.796 --> 01:28:31.931
Correct.

01:28:31.963 --> 01:28:33.097
How's your head?

01:28:33.131 --> 01:28:35.968
No complaints.

01:28:36.001 --> 01:28:38.003
How many times have you sharted
since last week?

01:28:38.036 --> 01:28:39.805
On purpose or by mistake?

01:28:45.176 --> 01:28:48.112
1, 2, 3.

01:28:48.646 --> 01:28:49.881
What's in the box?

01:28:56.889 --> 01:28:59.891
"I have heard
what the talkers were talking,

01:28:59.925 --> 01:29:03.028
the talk of the beginning
and the end.

01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:05.230
There was
never any more inception

01:29:05.264 --> 01:29:06.966
than there is now,

01:29:06.998 --> 01:29:10.635
nor any more youth or age
than there is now."

01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:18.243
1, 2, 3.

01:29:20.845 --> 01:29:21.746
Are you ready for this?

01:29:21.779 --> 01:29:23.248
Gotta seduce your man.

01:29:24.815 --> 01:29:25.850
Hey!

01:29:33.259 --> 01:29:34.827
Oh, that's when you were sick.

01:29:34.859 --> 01:29:35.260
Yeah.

01:29:44.136 --> 01:29:45.104
Hi.

01:29:45.136 --> 01:29:47.139
Um, hello.

01:29:47.171 --> 01:29:50.742
As many of you may know
from never seeing me before

01:29:50.775 --> 01:29:53.979
uh, I don't usually
do stuff like this,

01:29:54.011 --> 01:30:01.119
but um, I'm trying these days
to try I guess, so yeah.

01:30:01.153 --> 01:30:03.588
This is an original song
called "Milk water".

01:30:03.622 --> 01:30:05.224
Oh, uh, and thank you to Matt.

01:30:05.256 --> 01:30:07.759
Very special thanks to Matt
for letting me play here tonight

01:30:07.792 --> 01:30:09.260
and for conceding
that at least if I suck,

01:30:09.293 --> 01:30:10.895
you guys will all
probably drink more.

01:30:22.873 --> 01:30:25.010
Uh, just a glass of vodka
for you.

01:30:25.042 --> 01:30:25.743
Uh.

01:30:28.046 --> 01:30:31.684
I wanted to thank you
for the papers in person.

01:30:31.716 --> 01:30:33.018
I need to say I'm sorry to you.

01:30:33.051 --> 01:30:34.653
I... I really...
I think I needed this

01:30:34.685 --> 01:30:37.655
to be something that it was
not goin' to turn into

01:30:37.689 --> 01:30:39.592
and um, I'm sorry.

01:30:42.828 --> 01:30:44.597
I don't think I was
completely fair

01:30:44.630 --> 01:30:46.931
or honest
with my feelings either.

01:30:46.965 --> 01:30:51.971
I liked having a friend,
maybe a partner.

01:30:52.003 --> 01:30:53.838
I got carried away, too.

01:30:56.140 --> 01:30:57.742
Thank you.

01:31:01.445 --> 01:31:04.617
I need to be a parent
on my own first

01:31:04.649 --> 01:31:06.684
and then down the road.

01:31:06.717 --> 01:31:08.220
Who knows?

01:31:08.252 --> 01:31:10.255
I just need a chance
to get on that road.

01:31:14.393 --> 01:31:17.395
I'm meeting Ken
for a late dinner,

01:31:17.429 --> 01:31:19.965
so I gotta get going,

01:31:19.997 --> 01:31:22.201
but um, I will see you
at the check-up next week.

01:31:28.939 --> 01:31:33.244
I actually really
like Eddie as a name.

01:31:33.278 --> 01:31:34.012
Really?

01:31:34.046 --> 01:31:36.382
Yeah, it's cute.

01:31:36.414 --> 01:31:37.850
And it's very you.

01:31:49.961 --> 01:31:51.195
George!

01:31:51.229 --> 01:31:52.798
This feels
completely unnecessary.

01:31:52.831 --> 01:31:53.666
- No, no, yes it is.
- Come on.

01:31:53.698 --> 01:31:54.298
Where's the fucking car?

01:31:54.332 --> 01:31:55.267
I don't know!

01:31:55.300 --> 01:31:55.800
It said it's gonna be here
in two minutes.

01:31:57.234 --> 01:31:58.436
What?

01:31:58.470 --> 01:31:59.872
Will someone please
hand me my fucking phone

01:31:59.904 --> 01:32:01.105
or call Roger?

01:32:01.139 --> 01:32:02.708
This is really early
and I know it's normal.

01:32:02.740 --> 01:32:03.676
But like
what if it's too early?

01:32:03.708 --> 01:32:05.210
It's gonna be fine,
it wants to come out.

01:32:05.243 --> 01:32:06.011
I know, don't we all?

01:32:06.043 --> 01:32:06.610
Huh, see?

01:32:06.645 --> 01:32:07.246
She's still making jokes.

01:32:07.880 --> 01:32:09.715
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:32:09.747 --> 01:32:11.817
What if its head
is like sticking out of me?

01:32:11.850 --> 01:32:14.019
Do you want me to check?

01:32:14.051 --> 01:32:15.688
Yeah, actually I do.

01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:16.721
Okay.

01:32:18.756 --> 01:32:19.257
Actually, no.

01:32:19.291 --> 01:32:19.925
Never mind, George.

01:32:19.957 --> 01:32:20.925
This is weird.

01:32:20.958 --> 01:32:21.292
I don't want you to do that,
get out of there.

01:32:21.326 --> 01:32:22.159
Thank God.

01:32:22.194 --> 01:32:22.895
It's... it's...
it's here, it's here.

01:32:22.927 --> 01:32:24.829
Okay, please, look, this is it.

01:32:24.863 --> 01:32:26.265
It's the last thing you do.

01:32:26.297 --> 01:32:28.900
Just get in this cab
and then you're good.

01:32:28.934 --> 01:32:30.002
No way, man,

01:32:30.034 --> 01:32:32.037
I'm not takin'
fuckin' pregnant lady.

01:32:32.069 --> 01:32:33.738
- What? Are you kidding?
- That's discrimination!

01:32:33.771 --> 01:32:34.707
That's not discrimination!

01:32:36.140 --> 01:32:37.842
I don't wanna fuckin' baby goo
all over my car!

01:32:37.876 --> 01:32:39.478
What is your name?

01:32:39.511 --> 01:32:40.879
Frank.

01:32:40.912 --> 01:32:45.184
Okay, Frank,
I will name this baby Frank

01:32:45.216 --> 01:32:49.220
if you just drive us
to the fucking hospital, okay?

01:32:49.253 --> 01:32:50.021
Okay.

01:32:51.355 --> 01:32:54.358
But that better be
Frank Antonio Raffaelee III,

01:32:54.391 --> 01:32:55.092
With two Es!

01:32:55.126 --> 01:32:56.462
- Fuck, go!
- Fucking, just go!

01:32:56.494 --> 01:32:57.496
Just go!

01:32:57.529 --> 01:32:59.064
Send me a picture
of little Frankie

01:32:59.096 --> 01:33:00.198
and a Christmas card!

01:33:01.032 --> 01:33:01.865
Oh.

01:33:01.899 --> 01:33:02.299
Okay,
I'm gonna go get you a nurse.

01:33:02.333 --> 01:33:04.336
Deep breaths.

01:33:05.503 --> 01:33:07.338
Fuck.

01:33:08.239 --> 01:33:10.041
George, fuck, I can't do this.

01:33:10.074 --> 01:33:11.342
I can't do this please,
break my leg.

01:33:11.376 --> 01:33:12.478
Please just break...
break my leg,

01:33:12.511 --> 01:33:13.446
because then I can't push

01:33:13.479 --> 01:33:14.880
and then they have
to give me a C-section.

01:33:14.912 --> 01:33:16.214
Hey, hey, this is it.

01:33:16.247 --> 01:33:18.116
This is really it.

01:33:18.149 --> 01:33:20.085
You let me pull a splinter
out of your vagina

01:33:20.118 --> 01:33:21.754
after your skinny dip
off of Connor Demanuel's

01:33:21.787 --> 01:33:23.355
lake house dock junior year.

01:33:24.155 --> 01:33:25.356
- You can do this.
- Okay.

01:33:26.423 --> 01:33:27.826
- Hey.
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:33:39.970 --> 01:33:41.339
Hi.

01:33:41.372 --> 01:33:42.875
Hey, honey.

01:33:44.242 --> 01:33:47.980
Oh my God, I really passed out.

01:33:48.012 --> 01:33:49.413
Um, she with Roger?

01:33:49.447 --> 01:33:50.315
Are they okay?

01:33:50.347 --> 01:33:51.382
Mmhmm.

01:33:51.416 --> 01:33:54.119
Roger's out there,
she's with him.

01:33:54.152 --> 01:33:55.453
She's so beautiful.

01:33:55.487 --> 01:33:57.221
You did such a good job.

01:33:57.255 --> 01:33:58.556
I thought
it was gonna be disgusting

01:33:58.590 --> 01:33:59.525
and it was...

01:34:00.492 --> 01:34:01.860
But I also cried the whole time.

01:34:01.893 --> 01:34:02.895
He did.

01:34:02.927 --> 01:34:05.430
He really, really did.

01:34:05.462 --> 01:34:07.398
Thank you for being here,
you guys.

01:34:07.431 --> 01:34:10.301
Of course.

01:34:10.335 --> 01:34:13.005
Although, I did almost leave
out of sheer jealousy.

01:34:13.037 --> 01:34:14.972
I was in labor for 22 hours

01:34:15.006 --> 01:34:16.909
and you just
pushed her right out.

01:34:16.942 --> 01:34:18.042
22 hours?

01:34:18.076 --> 01:34:19.177
Ugh, it's gross.

01:34:19.211 --> 01:34:21.012
Like I guess taking
all that dick

01:34:21.046 --> 01:34:23.015
did really pay off.

01:34:23.047 --> 01:34:24.248
It's like uh, Slip 'N Slide.

01:34:24.282 --> 01:34:25.150
Yeah.

01:34:26.384 --> 01:34:27.152
All cool?

01:34:27.185 --> 01:34:28.287
- Mmhmm.
- Oh.

01:34:28.319 --> 01:34:29.153
Oh.

01:34:29.186 --> 01:34:30.154
Hi.

01:34:34.559 --> 01:34:35.561
Hi, honey.

01:34:35.594 --> 01:34:36.529
How are you?

01:34:36.561 --> 01:34:38.497
Why does everyone keep
calling me "honey"?

01:34:38.529 --> 01:34:40.231
Don't ruin your baby glow.

01:34:40.265 --> 01:34:41.333
I'm okay, I think.

01:34:41.365 --> 01:34:42.501
Why do I still look pregnant?

01:34:42.533 --> 01:34:43.835
This is so weird.

01:34:43.868 --> 01:34:45.103
You look radiant.

01:34:45.136 --> 01:34:47.039
Just don't look in the mirror.

01:34:47.872 --> 01:34:49.173
- You wanna hold her?
- No.

01:34:49.207 --> 01:34:51.110
No, no, no, no.

01:34:52.944 --> 01:34:54.580
I just... I feel
really sore still.

01:34:59.184 --> 01:35:01.119
Can I get you anything?

01:35:01.152 --> 01:35:03.188
Hmm.

01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:05.289
Yeah, actually, do you mind
grabbing me some ice?

01:35:05.323 --> 01:35:06.826
Of course.

01:35:39.490 --> 01:35:41.426
Are you still seeing Cameron
on Friday?

01:35:41.458 --> 01:35:43.127
Uh, yeah.

01:35:43.161 --> 01:35:45.029
Um, we're gonna get a drink
after a show.

01:35:45.063 --> 01:35:46.230
Can you read the vibe?

01:35:46.264 --> 01:35:47.666
Not really.

01:35:47.698 --> 01:35:49.300
No, we're just trying
not to overthink it, you know?

01:35:49.333 --> 01:35:50.269
Yeah.

01:35:50.301 --> 01:35:52.036
I'll see him, I'll make amends.

01:35:52.069 --> 01:35:53.204
Who knows after that?

01:35:54.706 --> 01:35:57.309
Oh, come on!

01:35:57.341 --> 01:35:59.944
I am finally getting
to hang out with a human adult.

01:35:59.978 --> 01:36:01.512
Are you really
gonna ruin it for me?

01:36:01.546 --> 01:36:03.248
