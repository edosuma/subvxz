Ethan Burke's wife might

00:50.418 --> 00:51.583
I want to call it off.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.485
But it's done, Adam.

00:53.487 --> 00:54.853
There's something
I have to show you.

00:54.855 --> 00:56.055
It's Adam Hessler.

00:56.057 --> 00:57.256
It's September 15.

00:57.258 --> 00:59.425
Still no signs of any survivors.

00:59.427 --> 01:00.759
Look.

01:00.761 --> 01:01.927
The Abbies...

01:01.929 --> 01:03.762
they're gone.

01:03.764 --> 01:05.097

WOMAN (over loudspeaker):
Good morning, Wayward Pines.

04:24.098 --> 04:25.964
The sun has risen on a new day.

04:25.966 --> 04:28.033
Let's celebrate our good fortune

04:28.035 --> 04:31.470
and continue to live

04:31.472 --> 04:33.105
Good morning, Wayward Pines.

04:33.107 --> 04:34.106
MEGAN:
<i> We have</i>

04:34.108 --> 04:36.108
25 pregnancies entering

04:36.110 --> 04:37.442
their third trimester,

04:37.444 --> 04:40.612
34 in the second,
and 19 in the first.

04:40.614 --> 04:43.448
In addition,
we have nine females

04:43.450 --> 04:45.217
that have become
viable this month.

04:45.219 --> 04:46.485
That's excellent.

04:46.487 --> 04:47.786
What about the research
in the lab?

04:47.788 --> 04:49.655
I will have an update
for you later this week.

04:49.657 --> 04:52.291
Maybe Dr. Yedlin could
help you with that.

04:52.293 --> 04:54.960
I-I'm not sure
Dr. Yedlin has that

04:54.962 --> 04:57.729
kind of expertise.
(chuckles)

04:57.731 --> 04:59.631
Research on the aberrations

04:59.633 --> 05:02.467
requires years of familiarity,

05:02.469 --> 05:05.137
as well as a very specific
biomedical background.

05:05.139 --> 05:07.572
I think he's a quick study.

05:07.574 --> 05:09.074
Maybe you could run it by him?

05:13.080 --> 05:14.813
MEGAN:<i> Okay, will do.</i>

05:14.815 --> 05:16.148
<i> We should also pull</i>
<i> together a plan</i>

05:16.150 --> 05:18.250
with Dr. Yedlin to complete
the residents' training.

05:18.252 --> 05:19.451
See if he has
any suggestions

05:19.453 --> 05:20.452
about how to
speed things up.

05:20.454 --> 05:21.820
That's a good idea.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.655
CJ.

05:25.926 --> 05:27.826
I thought this meeting
was about the crops,

05:27.828 --> 05:30.862
about securing a permanent
source of food and water.

05:30.864 --> 05:33.198
It's about the issues
facing Wayward Pines.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.666
We have a lot of them.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.035
None of them matters
if we can't feed the people.

05:37.037 --> 05:39.471
We're all still here
because of you, CJ.

05:39.473 --> 05:42.107
We know that.

05:42.109 --> 05:45.010
Please, stay.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.512
Jason, as Wayward Pines grows,

05:47.514 --> 05:50.182
our food supply
must grow with it.

05:50.184 --> 05:53.218
We should pick
our site properly.

05:53.220 --> 05:54.853
Maybe it's near
the original crops.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.655
Maybe it's slightly
further away,

05:56.657 --> 06:00.859
but we need to do soil studies;
measure sunlight,

06:00.861 --> 06:03.662
determine what from our
remaining seed bank

06:03.664 --> 06:04.896
will flourish.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.031
We should lay irrigation

06:06.033 --> 06:07.232
and source an additional
water supply...

06:07.234 --> 06:09.201
My understanding was that

06:09.203 --> 06:13.305
this was just about planting
a few extra rows of corn.

06:13.307 --> 06:15.674
This is a rare opportunity.

06:15.676 --> 06:18.210
With the Abbies
retreated, we can work

06:18.212 --> 06:20.178
without fear.

06:20.180 --> 06:22.381
Make careful
agricultural decisions

06:22.383 --> 06:23.548
that will benefit
all of us.

06:23.550 --> 06:24.683
No, there's still risks.

06:24.685 --> 06:25.884
We don't know where

06:25.886 --> 06:27.219
they've gone or
for how long.

06:27.221 --> 06:28.253
Look, Kerry's right.

06:28.255 --> 06:30.389
This... sounds ambitious.

06:30.391 --> 06:33.091
Maybe we need to focus
more on shoring up things

06:33.093 --> 06:34.092
inside Wayward Pines.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.160
No.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.831
What CJ suggests makes sense.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.233
All I'm saying

06:41.235 --> 06:43.568
is we have to think
about what Pilcher

06:43.570 --> 06:45.404
would have wanted; we must
never stray from that.

06:45.406 --> 06:47.873
He would have wanted
us to survive,

06:47.875 --> 06:50.509
and be bold as he was.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.744
If I hadn't planted those crops
out there three years ago,

06:52.746 --> 06:53.745
we would have starved

06:53.747 --> 06:55.347
by now.
Right.

06:55.349 --> 06:58.016
How can you be against
us securing our food?

06:59.019 --> 07:00.886
They'll have the

07:00.888 --> 07:02.888
same security,

07:02.890 --> 07:05.190
even more than
the harvesters did.

07:05.192 --> 07:08.693
They'll return once the first
batch of studies are complete.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.129
They're not going far.

07:15.135 --> 07:17.169
I understand
your concerns, Megan...

07:18.772 --> 07:22.040
...but we need to do this.

07:44.264 --> 07:46.364
(groans)

08:00.647 --> 08:02.581
Easy, easy.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.649
You from Wayward Pines?

08:04.651 --> 08:07.419
Where else would I be from?

08:07.421 --> 08:09.321
You a nomad?
What? "A nomad"?

08:09.323 --> 08:11.356
No, no.

08:11.358 --> 08:12.424
Who sent you?

08:12.426 --> 08:13.492
Pilcher?

08:13.494 --> 08:15.327
No, man, Pilcher's dead.

08:15.329 --> 08:18.029
Who are you?

08:19.366 --> 08:22.834
Look, you mind easing up on
the knife work there, buddy?

08:22.836 --> 08:24.669
Huh? I'm not one of our
little mutant friends,

08:24.671 --> 08:25.770
in case you can't tell.

08:25.772 --> 08:27.506
We're on the same side
here, I promise you.

08:27.508 --> 08:29.741
Please.

08:33.981 --> 08:36.014
Who's in charge?

08:36.016 --> 08:37.782
Is it Pam?

08:37.784 --> 08:40.785
No, no, Pam, uh...

08:40.787 --> 08:42.854
Pam did the deed, actually.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.322
At least that's
what I hear.

08:44.324 --> 08:46.224
No one's seen
her for awhile.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.126
No, there's a... there's
a kid in charge now.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.829
His, uh...
his name's Jason.

08:50.831 --> 08:52.864
You'd love him.

08:55.369 --> 08:56.535
Where the hell are we?

08:56.537 --> 09:00.872
I woke up in... some pit.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.841
Do they put people in pits?

09:02.843 --> 09:04.576
They do a lot of things.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.215
Where you going?

09:11.218 --> 09:13.251
So, wait, Pilcher
sent you out here?

09:13.253 --> 09:14.252
What'd you do
to piss him off?

09:14.254 --> 09:17.055
Nothing.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.723
A bunch of us were sent.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.725
Scout and report back.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.727
To look for other communities.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.062
Other survivors.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.463
Yeah, and-and what'd you find?

09:27.668 --> 09:29.467
I found you.

09:34.575 --> 09:36.875
I'll get Lucy to
wash your hair.

09:36.877 --> 09:38.677
Lucy?

09:41.448 --> 09:42.647
Lucy?

09:48.922 --> 09:50.956
Oh...

09:50.958 --> 09:54.426
honey, it's okay.

09:54.428 --> 09:58.597
I remember
the first time I got mine.

09:58.599 --> 10:01.266
It's really scary, I know...

10:01.268 --> 10:02.734
but you'll get used to it.

10:02.736 --> 10:05.937
How old were you
when you were paired up?

10:05.939 --> 10:09.140
It was a little different
back then.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.612
You know what?

10:13.614 --> 10:17.916
They're gonna make you meet
a few boys, and one of them

10:17.918 --> 10:19.784
will be really nice.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.953
I don't want to be a mom.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.623
Lucy...

10:24.625 --> 10:26.091
I can't; I'm not ready.

10:26.093 --> 10:27.592
Please don't make me go back.

10:27.594 --> 10:28.793
I'm sorry.

10:28.795 --> 10:29.894
No.

10:29.896 --> 10:31.963
You have to go back.

10:31.965 --> 10:35.400
Honey, if you don't, they'll
figure out something's wrong.

10:35.402 --> 10:37.535
Come here.

10:51.785 --> 10:54.319
Are you sure
they're gone?

10:54.321 --> 10:55.787
Not sure.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.656
Never sure.

10:57.658 --> 11:00.358
Well, that's reassuring.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.561
They usually send a scout.

11:04.998 --> 11:08.466
Catch the scout
before they can report back.

11:08.468 --> 11:10.769
Then you've got a chance to run.

11:13.106 --> 11:15.006
There's a method to them.

11:16.677 --> 11:18.943
If you can survive
long enough to learn learn it.

11:24.685 --> 11:28.486
So what's your story?

11:28.488 --> 11:31.556
(sighing):
Uh... well...

11:31.558 --> 11:32.857
Uh, Group B.

11:32.859 --> 11:36.995
Uh, woke up
in paradise about...

11:36.997 --> 11:39.164
five years ago, I think.
A little before Invasion Day.

11:39.166 --> 11:40.331
I don't mean that.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.934
Why are you out here?

11:47.240 --> 11:50.375
I colored outside the lines.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.748
Seems like a...
harsh punishment.

11:56.750 --> 11:59.451
Yeah. I agree.

12:00.921 --> 12:03.254
But, uh...

12:03.256 --> 12:05.824
at least I'm
in the clear now, right?

12:06.827 --> 12:09.527
Depends.

12:09.529 --> 12:11.596
I'm going home.

12:11.598 --> 12:14.199
Somebody I gotta see.

12:14.201 --> 12:17.702
But... (sighs) who knows?

12:17.704 --> 12:19.938
They might just put you
right back out here.

12:23.009 --> 12:25.043
SEAN:
I'm bad...

12:25.045 --> 12:28.713
Hearts.

12:28.715 --> 12:30.548
All right.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.984
(monitor alarm beeping)

12:34.354 --> 12:36.421
RAMSEY:
Abbies?

12:36.423 --> 12:38.022
No. It can't be. The...

12:38.024 --> 12:40.091
The signature's wrong.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.459
Let's get to the fence.

12:52.038 --> 12:53.271
It's Xander and someone else.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.439
Open the gate!

12:54.441 --> 12:56.374
(gate clanking open,
alarm sounding)

12:56.376 --> 12:57.509
On guard!

13:01.715 --> 13:02.714
GUARD:
Is that Hassler?

13:02.716 --> 13:03.782
GUARD 2:
Might be.

13:16.997 --> 13:19.497
Who are you?

13:19.499 --> 13:21.299
Dr. Yedlin.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.502
Who are you?

13:25.639 --> 13:28.573
Why did you go out there?

13:30.410 --> 13:32.844
How far did you get?

13:37.818 --> 13:39.684
Are we alone?

13:51.665 --> 13:54.065
I guess that's something
that we still don't know.

13:56.002 --> 13:57.902
(whispers):
We know.

14:01.675 --> 14:05.109
They're not our enemies.

14:05.111 --> 14:07.846
They're our replacements.

14:08.815 --> 14:10.348
What does that mean?

14:10.350 --> 14:13.017
(groaning)

14:13.019 --> 14:15.086
Are you in pain?

14:21.027 --> 14:22.927
Lie back.

14:24.497 --> 14:27.131

14:37.811 --> 14:38.843
JASON:
<i> Adam Hassler.</i>

14:38.845 --> 14:40.378
How's he doing?

14:40.380 --> 14:41.880
You'd have to ask him that.

14:41.882 --> 14:45.049
He's not really
talking to us right now.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.551
That's why I'm asking you.

14:46.553 --> 14:50.722
And I'm his doctor,
so I'm not talking, either.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.891
Little thing called
the Hippocratic Oath.

14:52.893 --> 14:56.060
We live in a different time now.

14:56.062 --> 14:59.330
Some of those old
rules don't apply.

14:59.332 --> 15:02.166
Is he stable, Doctor?

15:02.168 --> 15:03.568
Mentally, I mean.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.436
What part of what I said
did you not understand?

15:05.438 --> 15:06.704
I understand your position.

15:06.706 --> 15:09.274
But Adam Hassler's a hero.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.242
You see, Pilcher sent
a dozen nomads

15:11.244 --> 15:13.912
in a dozen directions
out beyond the fence,

15:13.914 --> 15:16.347
to report back on everything.

15:16.349 --> 15:18.616
And Adam's the only one
who's ever returned.

15:19.853 --> 15:21.686
This is big news
for Wayward Pines.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.087
We need to know what he's seen,

15:23.089 --> 15:24.589
what he knows,
even the smallest piece

15:24.591 --> 15:26.691
of information.
Then ask him.

15:26.693 --> 15:27.926
Ask him.

15:33.767 --> 15:37.135
They come to you
when they're sick.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.404
Isn't that right, Dr. Yedlin?

15:39.406 --> 15:40.605
That's when you care for them.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.273
That's when they trouble you.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.575
If they trouble you.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.678
With your manner, sometimes,
it's hard to tell.

15:49.316 --> 15:52.417
They're my responsibility
all the time.

15:52.419 --> 15:54.552
They're like my extended
family, in a way.

15:54.554 --> 15:57.388
Like Pam Pilcher, you mean?

15:57.390 --> 16:00.124
You know nothing about that.

16:00.126 --> 16:02.293
I know she's dead.

16:03.630 --> 16:06.064
I worry about all of them.

16:06.066 --> 16:08.132
They keep me up at night.

16:08.134 --> 16:11.336
And I'm willing to do whatever
it takes to protect them.

16:11.338 --> 16:12.837
I'll make the tough choices.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.474
Would you?

16:18.311 --> 16:20.712
(door opens, closes)

16:23.283 --> 16:26.617
(panting)

16:26.619 --> 16:28.886
(growling, snarling)
(grunting)

16:33.994 --> 16:36.394
(sudden yell, then gasping)

16:54.481 --> 16:56.647
(groans, pants)

16:56.649 --> 16:58.149
(screech echoing)

16:58.151 --> 16:59.250
(yells, gasps)

17:19.873 --> 17:20.872
(screech echoing)

17:20.874 --> 17:22.940
(grunting, gasping)

17:26.880 --> 17:28.513
Oh, Mr. Hassler.

17:28.515 --> 17:31.816
I was able
to pull a few strings,

17:31.818 --> 17:35.386
and I booked you
a complimentary haircut.

17:35.388 --> 17:39.724
And I was also lucky enough
to get you a nice body wax,

17:39.726 --> 17:41.559
and a manicure-pedicure.

17:41.561 --> 17:42.760
(grunting)

17:47.000 --> 17:49.901
But perhaps, at this juncture,

17:49.903 --> 17:52.670
we should consider rescheduling.

17:55.909 --> 17:57.708
Behold!

17:57.710 --> 18:02.080
This is the land
where I shall build a community.

18:02.082 --> 18:05.917
And lead humanity
out of the darkness.

18:05.919 --> 18:10.521
As we rise from sleep
and return to our world,

18:10.523 --> 18:13.591
the first generations
shall lead us,

18:13.593 --> 18:16.260
and create families
of their own.

18:16.262 --> 18:20.298
The dream of
a repopulated Earth is alive.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.933
And it begins here,

18:21.935 --> 18:25.436
in a town
called the Wayward Pines.

Lucy, dear...

19:24.964 --> 19:26.964

19:26.966 --> 19:28.766
I noticed you've
been taking extra

19:28.768 --> 19:30.768
bathroom breaks lately.

19:30.770 --> 19:33.271
Just something I ate, ma'am.

19:33.273 --> 19:35.706
Oh.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.508
All right.

19:41.347 --> 19:44.081
Hey. What did, uh,
"Clear and Severe" want?

19:46.686 --> 19:48.186
What's wrong?

19:49.689 --> 19:51.389
I think she knows.

19:53.126 --> 19:56.460
Don't worry. I won't
say anything, okay?

20:01.634 --> 20:02.900
MAN:

20:07.307 --> 20:09.740

It is you.

20:58.791 --> 21:00.391
Where is Ethan?

21:00.393 --> 21:02.660
Ethan's gone.

21:04.264 --> 21:07.365
They just put Ben
outside the fence.

21:07.367 --> 21:10.434
Did you see him at all?
Is he alive?

21:10.436 --> 21:13.337
I didn't see him.

21:16.242 --> 21:18.142
You son of a bitch.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.946
You sent Ethan here.

21:24.717 --> 21:27.551
You knew all along,
didn't you?

21:27.553 --> 21:29.287
You were working with Pilcher,

21:29.289 --> 21:32.356
and you knew about this place,
and you were in on it.

21:37.897 --> 21:40.498
My family's all gone
because of you.

21:43.236 --> 21:44.969
We trusted you.

22:01.120 --> 22:04.188
♪ ♪

22:28.214 --> 22:29.380
Rise and shine.

22:31.651 --> 22:34.218
I just couldn't wait
for my morning scoop.

22:35.488 --> 22:36.954
Guess I should've
changed the locks.

22:38.358 --> 22:39.890
I have keys.

22:39.892 --> 22:42.460
They open a lot of things
in this town.

22:44.630 --> 22:46.864
The kids will be
excited you're back.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.165
What's the flavor
of the day?

22:48.167 --> 22:49.166
Corn.

22:49.168 --> 22:50.334
Really?

22:50.336 --> 22:52.303
I was banking more on remorse.

22:56.309 --> 22:57.875
Hassler's not talking

22:57.877 --> 23:00.511
and Jason is still deciding
what to do with you.

23:00.513 --> 23:04.315
He knows about the guns,
the grenades you stole,

23:04.317 --> 23:06.016
and that your loyalty
to the First Generation

23:06.018 --> 23:08.018
was...

23:08.020 --> 23:10.054
elastic...

23:10.056 --> 23:13.657
and still worthy
of punishment.

23:13.659 --> 23:17.528
But your survival made
you a bit of a hero,

23:17.530 --> 23:19.563
and things were just
getting back to normal.

23:19.565 --> 23:21.732
I'm not gonna be any trouble.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.601
For how long?

23:23.603 --> 23:24.702
I don't know.

23:24.704 --> 23:26.604
Till we run out of ice cream?

23:28.040 --> 23:30.541
I wouldn't make a joke
out of this, Xander.

23:30.543 --> 23:33.878
We're giving you a second chance
for about the tenth time.

23:33.880 --> 23:34.945
I understand.

23:34.947 --> 23:36.414
If there's no fight,
I won't pick one.

23:36.416 --> 23:38.749
Then how will you
amuse yourself?

23:38.751 --> 23:41.886
How did you make
it out there, anyway?

23:41.888 --> 23:44.054
Did Hassler help you?

23:44.056 --> 23:45.189
Did you get a good
look at that guy?

23:45.191 --> 23:46.857
He may have been

23:46.859 --> 23:49.593
on his way back in,
but he's lucky I found him.

23:52.698 --> 23:53.964
You know...

23:55.735 --> 23:58.769
they're not just
dumb animals, Kerry.

23:58.771 --> 24:00.938
There's a method to them.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.174
If you can survive
long enough to learn it.

24:04.444 --> 24:06.377
So you learned
something about them.

24:06.379 --> 24:08.179
Something that can help us.

24:09.549 --> 24:11.482
I'll give Jason a full report.

24:11.484 --> 24:14.118
I can even talk to Adam, too,
if that's what you want.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.754
We developed a kind of...

24:16.756 --> 24:19.290
bond out there.

24:19.292 --> 24:21.158
If that's something you think

24:21.160 --> 24:24.061
might help my position
around here.

24:37.610 --> 24:40.044
(licking, smacking)

24:42.281 --> 24:45.082
(smacking)

24:52.191 --> 24:53.424
(growls)

24:54.827 --> 24:56.494
(boy screams)

24:56.496 --> 24:58.562
(panting)

25:14.947 --> 25:17.181
They're our replacement?

25:17.183 --> 25:18.516
That's what he said.

25:18.518 --> 25:21.352
Adam Hassler said that.

25:21.354 --> 25:24.154
(inhales deeply, sighs)

25:24.156 --> 25:27.491
Theo, I think you
should say something.

25:27.493 --> 25:29.660
Pilcher called
them "Abbies"

25:29.662 --> 25:31.996
because they're
aberrations.

25:31.998 --> 25:34.231
They're not supposed to be
the future of the planet.

25:36.569 --> 25:38.068
And apparently, now,

25:38.070 --> 25:40.037
they're sending people
outside the fence.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.805
(sighs)

25:41.807 --> 25:43.474
I think you should tell Jason.

25:43.476 --> 25:45.876
I'm not putting my fate
in his hands.

25:45.878 --> 25:48.412
Well, it's not
just yours, is it?

25:51.551 --> 25:53.617
Mmm.

25:55.488 --> 25:59.390
Nothing says Wayward Pines like
a piece of fresh, warm fudge.

25:59.392 --> 26:00.491
(chuckles)

26:02.328 --> 26:03.694
Thanks for
meeting me, Frank.

26:03.696 --> 26:05.262
I know it's not exactly cool

26:05.264 --> 26:07.064
to be seen in public
with your old teacher.

26:07.066 --> 26:10.467
Yeah, I mean it's... it's fine.

26:11.737 --> 26:14.038
Do you know why I asked
you here today?

26:14.040 --> 26:15.673
No?

26:15.675 --> 26:17.074
To remind you

26:17.076 --> 26:20.077
of David Pilcher's
greatest gift to us.

26:20.079 --> 26:21.512
The fence?

26:21.514 --> 26:23.581
Life.

26:23.583 --> 26:25.749
So precious and so necessary.

26:25.751 --> 26:27.017
Wouldn't you agree?

26:27.019 --> 26:30.020
And each of us
must contribute.

26:30.022 --> 26:33.924
And I wanted to
remind you, Frank,

26:33.926 --> 26:36.126
one of the rules of the Academy

26:36.128 --> 26:39.029
is that there are
to be no secrets

26:39.031 --> 26:41.699
between the members
of the First Generation,

26:41.701 --> 26:44.401
and there are certainly none

26:44.403 --> 26:47.004
that should be kept from me.

26:48.975 --> 26:51.442
So... we should
rat each other out.

26:51.444 --> 26:53.143
Let's not use that word.

26:53.145 --> 26:56.113
We should... share information.

26:56.115 --> 26:57.448
We should be honest

26:57.450 --> 27:00.618
with ourselves
and with each other.

27:01.487 --> 27:03.287
Frank...

27:03.289 --> 27:04.989
help me with your sister.

27:06.826 --> 27:08.292
I don't... I don't know
what you're talking--

27:08.294 --> 27:09.393
Frank.

27:09.395 --> 27:11.629
It's me.

27:14.066 --> 27:15.299
She's not ready.

27:15.301 --> 27:17.935
That is not your
decision to make.

27:17.937 --> 27:19.937
I promised I'd protect her,
I-I-I'm not-not gonna...

27:19.939 --> 27:21.472
You-you-you are
protecting her,

27:21.474 --> 27:23.107
and that is so admirable--

27:23.109 --> 27:24.642
especially after
everything that's happened

27:24.644 --> 27:27.244
to the two of you--
but she's growing up, Frank.

27:28.648 --> 27:30.914
She's a blooming flower.

27:30.916 --> 27:33.617
She's becoming a woman,
and that is something

27:33.619 --> 27:34.652
that should be celebrated.

27:34.654 --> 27:36.854
Hmm?

27:36.856 --> 27:41.258
And what we encourage is
simply a natural way to live,

27:41.260 --> 27:43.427
without restrictions,
and a chance for her

27:43.429 --> 27:46.230
to serve a higher purpose.

27:55.374 --> 27:57.207
There.

27:57.209 --> 28:00.210
I know you want to do
what's best for her...

28:00.212 --> 28:02.112
but now
the two of you need to do

28:02.114 --> 28:04.748
what's best
for Wayward Pines.

28:06.652 --> 28:07.651
CJ:
<i> The Abbies</i>

28:07.653 --> 28:09.153
are gone, Doctor.

28:09.155 --> 28:11.188
Maybe not forever.

28:11.190 --> 28:13.023
The town may still be at risk.

28:13.025 --> 28:15.059
But I understand
your concern.

28:16.529 --> 28:18.662
But we have a chance
to secure our future

28:18.664 --> 28:20.931
and start forging a new path.

28:23.369 --> 28:25.035
Look...

28:25.037 --> 28:26.904
I'm new here, I get it.

28:28.507 --> 28:31.542
But I saw them making ladders
with their bodies.

28:31.544 --> 28:33.544
It's problem solving.

28:33.546 --> 28:35.045
It's social structure.

28:35.047 --> 28:37.948
They're willing
to sacrifice themselves.

28:39.318 --> 28:40.884
You're underestimating them

28:40.886 --> 28:42.986
and putting your people
at risk.

28:42.988 --> 28:45.222
How long have you
been here, Doctor?

28:45.224 --> 28:47.725
A week? Ten days?

28:49.028 --> 28:52.096
Now imagine you've
been here a year...

28:52.098 --> 28:54.732
five years, ten years.

28:54.734 --> 28:56.567
Just consider.

28:56.569 --> 29:00.904
The life you had,
the people you left behind...

29:00.906 --> 29:05.542
those memories start to fade,
and the visits in your mind,

29:05.544 --> 29:07.444
the ones that gave you comfort,

29:07.446 --> 29:10.881
becomes nothing more than
placing flowers on a grave.

29:10.883 --> 29:13.050
Our work is important,

29:13.052 --> 29:14.451
yes...

29:14.453 --> 29:17.221
but this isn't
about water, or corn,

29:17.223 --> 29:19.389
or soil samples.

29:19.391 --> 29:23.193
We go outside the fence
tomorrow, we stay outside.

29:23.195 --> 29:25.529
It's not even about us.

29:27.266 --> 29:30.934
It's about the people
we leave behind,

29:30.936 --> 29:34.404
the ones that
can't come with us.

29:34.406 --> 29:36.440
Yes...

29:36.442 --> 29:39.009
through us they can
see the horizon...

29:40.946 --> 29:43.113
...and through us they can hope.

29:58.063 --> 29:59.830
They get to leave?

29:59.832 --> 30:02.032
Yeah, it's exciting,
isn't it?

30:24.256 --> 30:26.390
MAN: Hold on!

30:28.160 --> 30:29.293
Theresa?

30:29.295 --> 30:30.961
I'm gonna come with you.

30:30.963 --> 30:33.163
CJ...

30:33.165 --> 30:35.566
let me find my son.

30:39.104 --> 30:40.737
What about him?

30:44.643 --> 30:46.176
He's not my problem.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.547
MAN: Let's roll.

30:55.821 --> 30:57.888
(alarm sounding)

31:10.870 --> 31:12.936
(cash register dings,
mellow music plays over P.A.)

31:16.242 --> 31:17.374
Hey.

31:19.311 --> 31:20.410
You okay?

31:22.882 --> 31:26.183
Right. Well, uh...

31:26.185 --> 31:28.352
I'm-I'm still here.

31:28.354 --> 31:30.354
I guess that counts
for something.

31:30.356 --> 31:32.823
Yeah.

31:32.825 --> 31:37.327
I... see your husband's
awake... or...

31:37.329 --> 31:39.263
unfrozen, or whatever.

31:39.265 --> 31:40.397
Is he leaving you alone?

31:40.399 --> 31:42.232
Your husband?
No.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.067
I mean Jason.
Oh.

31:44.069 --> 31:45.936
Right.

31:45.938 --> 31:48.438
Uh... unclear.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.240
I told them I had
new information

31:50.242 --> 31:51.341
about the Abbies.

31:51.343 --> 31:52.342
Do you?

31:52.344 --> 31:54.745
I'll come up with something.

31:54.747 --> 31:57.080
(chuckling):
Xander, try to be good.

31:57.082 --> 31:59.917
I'm just trying to stay alive.

31:59.919 --> 32:03.186
Yeah, aren't we all?

32:09.428 --> 32:11.228
On the house.

32:11.230 --> 32:14.164
Wow, lucky me.

32:15.634 --> 32:18.368
Hey, I'm, uh, I'm thinking
about calling 'em

32:18.370 --> 32:19.870
Wayward Vines.

32:20.873 --> 32:21.939
I think that's brilliant.

32:21.941 --> 32:22.940
Mm?
Mm.

32:22.942 --> 32:24.441
Come on, that's funny.

32:24.443 --> 32:25.943
Very charming.

32:28.747 --> 32:31.448
(door bell jangles)

32:31.450 --> 32:33.784
Megan.

32:33.786 --> 32:35.052
May I help you?

32:35.054 --> 32:37.287
I was just
talking with Lucy.

32:37.289 --> 32:38.622
I can see that.

32:38.624 --> 32:41.325
What about?

32:41.327 --> 32:43.093
Well, if you really must know,

32:43.095 --> 32:45.662
I was reminding Lucy
of her obligations.

32:45.664 --> 32:46.763
Obligations?

32:46.765 --> 32:49.132
Yes, it's exciting,
isn't it?

32:49.134 --> 32:50.801
Lucy, you need to
come with me, dear.

32:50.803 --> 32:52.602
No, please.

32:52.604 --> 32:54.237
Lucy, could you step outside
for a moment?

32:55.908 --> 32:58.008
Try this, it's really nice.

32:59.945 --> 33:01.578
(door bell jangles)

33:02.581 --> 33:05.649
Every member of our community

33:05.651 --> 33:09.786
has a duty to ensure the future
of the human race, hmm?

33:09.788 --> 33:12.322
Obviously,
there'll be some failures,

33:12.324 --> 33:13.657
such as yours.

33:13.659 --> 33:15.425
Which is why we need

33:15.427 --> 33:17.094
to encourage
the First Generation

33:17.096 --> 33:19.796
to bear children
as quickly as possible.

33:19.798 --> 33:21.431
I understand that.

33:21.433 --> 33:23.000
But you can preserve humanity

33:23.002 --> 33:25.369
and try to hold on to some,
at the same time.

33:26.972 --> 33:29.039
You do realize you're asking
children to bear children.

33:29.041 --> 33:30.774
Ye... it-it's
a survival strategy

33:30.776 --> 33:32.609
used by numerous societies.

33:32.611 --> 33:34.177
Primitive societies.

33:34.179 --> 33:36.680
Megan, these girls
should have a choice.

33:36.682 --> 33:38.315
Lucy has a choice.

33:38.317 --> 33:40.884
Actually, Rebecca,
she really doesn't.

33:40.886 --> 33:43.220
Do you need me
to walk you through it?

33:44.723 --> 33:46.757
I will not let you hurt her.

33:51.497 --> 33:53.797
No one is above the rules.

33:53.799 --> 33:56.166
You leave me no choice.

33:56.168 --> 33:57.567
I'll be seeing Jason
in 30 minutes

33:57.569 --> 33:58.869
for a research briefing.

33:58.871 --> 34:01.671
You know I'll have
to report this.

34:01.673 --> 34:04.908
Report what, exactly?

34:04.910 --> 34:06.977
Rebecca Yedlin's
not following the rules?

34:06.979 --> 34:10.213
Rebecca Yedlin
needs to be reined in.

34:10.215 --> 34:12.082
Reckoned?

34:12.084 --> 34:14.317
Do you really want
to pick that fight, Megan?

34:14.319 --> 34:16.887
Because I'm not sure if this is
going to be a winner for you.

34:22.061 --> 34:24.628
You're being very
self-destructive, Rebecca.

34:26.765 --> 34:29.332
If only you could see it.

34:31.170 --> 34:33.170
Lucy... come on in.

34:34.773 --> 34:36.206
Come home with me tonight.

34:36.208 --> 34:38.141
I'll walk you to school
in the morning, okay?

34:47.920 --> 34:51.955

35:17.916 --> 35:19.116
Is it me?

35:19.118 --> 35:21.751
Are you trying to help me?

35:21.753 --> 35:24.087
Yes.

35:24.089 --> 35:26.389

that you can describe,

35:52.985 --> 35:54.718
and no one will believe.

36:00.159 --> 36:02.926

38:23.302 --> 38:25.001
Okay.

38:27.973 --> 38:29.939
Where are her parents?

38:29.941 --> 38:31.408
They died on Invasion Day.

38:31.410 --> 38:34.577
So she lives with her brother
at the Academy,

38:34.579 --> 38:36.313
with the other orphans.

38:36.315 --> 38:37.881
I look out for her now.

38:41.086 --> 38:43.820
She got her period
a couple of days ago,

38:43.822 --> 38:47.424
and they wanted to enroll her
in the fertility program.

38:48.360 --> 38:49.659
<i> That</i> girl.

38:51.096 --> 38:52.262
She's what, 11?

38:52.264 --> 38:53.430
I know.

38:54.833 --> 38:57.467
Well, how does that work?

38:57.469 --> 38:58.802
Do they inseminate them?

38:58.804 --> 39:01.338
They pair them up.

39:01.340 --> 39:04.341
And they put them into these

39:04.343 --> 39:06.676
procreation rooms
at the Academy.

39:06.678 --> 39:10.113
(sighs) And I think they do
things the old-fashioned way.

39:21.993 --> 39:25.128
Old-fashioned is, uh, a six-pack

39:25.130 --> 39:27.197
and borrowing
your brother's car,

39:27.199 --> 39:29.799
your dad's cologne
and the radio.

It's not...

39:31.503 --> 39:33.903
(sighs heavily)

39:36.508 --> 39:38.208
Who picks them?

39:38.210 --> 39:39.542
Who pairs them up?

39:39.544 --> 39:40.810
I don't know.

39:40.812 --> 39:42.212
Not one person, I think.

39:42.214 --> 39:45.715
And it's by looks,
or, uh, intelligence?

39:45.717 --> 39:48.385
Size, maybe?

39:49.388 --> 39:51.554
It's eugenics.

39:51.556 --> 39:53.022
And you know this.

39:53.024 --> 39:54.357
I'm on your side, Theo.

39:54.359 --> 39:55.558
I agree with you.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.060
I'm trying my best
to protect her

39:57.062 --> 39:59.896
from what I can,
for as long as I can.

39:59.898 --> 40:02.899
This is why she's here with us.

40:02.901 --> 40:06.503
CJ told me why
they're going outside.

40:06.505 --> 40:08.505
It's not the food.

40:09.541 --> 40:13.042
He says it's to give hope.

40:13.044 --> 40:16.679
Which, on some level,
makes sense to me.

40:16.681 --> 40:20.784
But every time one thing here
seems almost rational,

40:20.786 --> 40:23.887
two things pop up that make
absolutely no sense at all.

40:23.889 --> 40:26.556
So we talk.

40:26.558 --> 40:28.758
And we try to make sense
of what we can.

40:28.760 --> 40:30.693
The talk is all survival.
