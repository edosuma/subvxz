00:31.824 --> 00:33.388
- Shawny?

00:33.412 --> 00:35.563
Wake up, my sweet boy.

00:35.587 --> 00:39.843
Shawn, I have something really
special I wanna show you.

00:39.867 --> 00:42.018
We have to get going or
we're gonna miss it, okay?

00:42.042 --> 00:43.053
- Mom?

00:43.077 --> 00:44.077
- Let's go.

00:45.528 --> 00:46.528
Wake up.

02:21.210 --> 02:23.429
- Where do you think
you're going?

02:23.453 --> 02:24.672
- Going on an adventure.

02:24.696 --> 02:26.708
- You never take me on
any of your adventures.

02:26.732 --> 02:27.537
Can I go?

02:27.561 --> 02:28.572
Please?

02:28.596 --> 02:31.023
- Sorry, Stink, that's no.

02:31.047 --> 02:32.048
- Well, why?

02:33.578 --> 02:34.578
- Simple.

02:34.602 --> 02:35.579
You smell.

02:35.603 --> 02:37.122
- You are so mean.

02:39.400 --> 02:40.481
- Hey!

02:40.505 --> 02:41.747
Hey, geek face!

02:43.806 --> 02:45.486
You know, I was actually
thinking to myself

02:45.510 --> 02:47.315
how excited I was to
see you this morning.

02:47.339 --> 02:48.213
- Really?

02:48.237 --> 02:49.766
- Then I puked in my mouth

02:49.790 --> 02:51.250
and the thought
eventually subsided.

02:51.274 --> 02:52.458
- Subsided?

02:52.482 --> 02:53.762
That's a big word
for you, buddy.

02:53.786 --> 02:54.529
- You like that?

02:54.553 --> 02:55.358
That was just for you.

02:55.382 --> 02:56.359
Now get your gear in the rear

02:56.383 --> 02:57.783
and let's get this
show on the road.

02:57.807 --> 02:58.326
- All right.

02:58.350 --> 02:59.350
- Son.

03:02.251 --> 03:04.021
- Hey, thanks for
getting the supplies.

03:04.045 --> 03:06.058
- No problem, bro.

03:06.082 --> 03:07.784
There's actually
this really hot TA

03:07.808 --> 03:09.406
in my bio class this year,

03:09.430 --> 03:12.237
totally wants to do experiments
on my bod, obviously.

03:12.261 --> 03:13.821
So when you called
asking for the stuff,

03:13.845 --> 03:16.033
I said, "Hey, let the
experimentation begin."

03:16.057 --> 03:17.057
- Gross.

03:19.578 --> 03:21.038
- Help me, father.

03:21.062 --> 03:23.040
They're all insane.

03:23.064 --> 03:26.941
Purify them or just take
them away from my life.

03:26.965 --> 03:29.209
Either way is fine with me.

03:37.631 --> 03:38.849
Father,

03:38.873 --> 03:40.116
please help us.

03:40.979 --> 03:43.153
I can't do this on my own.

03:46.571 --> 03:47.824
- It's good to see you.

03:47.848 --> 03:49.746
- Good to see you, man.

03:52.887 --> 03:54.486
- What is that?

03:54.510 --> 03:56.281
- It's a map, smarty.

03:56.305 --> 03:58.766
- You don't have a GPS, Mr.
Techy?

03:58.790 --> 03:59.939
- Of course I do.

03:59.963 --> 04:01.631
It's just...

04:01.655 --> 04:02.839
The age of machines and all,

04:02.863 --> 04:06.291
I feel like my generation
depends on it way too much.

04:06.315 --> 04:07.844
I mean,

04:07.868 --> 04:09.225
the average teenager
doesn't know

04:09.249 --> 04:11.365
how to navigate a single block,

04:11.389 --> 04:13.919
let along, know how
to use a simple map.

04:13.943 --> 04:15.231
And the day will come

04:15.255 --> 04:16.855
when the sun decides
to emit a large CME,

04:16.879 --> 04:18.889
whipping out our power grids.

04:18.913 --> 04:20.822
How're we gonna get around?

04:20.846 --> 04:22.123
Complete chaos.

04:23.021 --> 04:24.999
- That's deep, bro.

04:25.023 --> 04:27.588
You managed to impress and
depress me at the same time.

04:27.612 --> 04:29.900
- Stop pushing me then.

04:29.924 --> 04:31.684
- I just like my GPS
because I like to listen

04:31.708 --> 04:33.559
to the sexy British chick.

04:33.583 --> 04:35.389
"Turn left here."

04:35.413 --> 04:37.322
"Make a u-turn."

04:37.346 --> 04:38.346
- Figures.

04:39.624 --> 04:40.808
All right.

04:40.832 --> 04:42.223
Head up to Woodshire Fields,

04:42.247 --> 04:44.018
take the 15 all the way north.

04:44.042 --> 04:45.709
- Woodshire?

04:45.733 --> 04:47.987
That's where we went
camping with Dad, right?

04:48.011 --> 04:49.195
- Yeah.

04:49.219 --> 04:51.750
It's got a lot of land to
conduct a successful launch.

04:51.774 --> 04:52.889
- All right.

04:52.913 --> 04:54.408
Well that's a long haul.

04:54.432 --> 04:56.617
I should probably go in and
say hi to Dad then, right?

04:56.641 --> 04:59.275
- No, he's still asleep

04:59.299 --> 05:00.369
with Shannon.

05:01.749 --> 05:03.934
- Are you still
being mean to her?

05:03.958 --> 05:05.108
She's a good person, Shawn.

05:05.132 --> 05:07.386
I don't understand why you're
not being nice to her.

05:07.410 --> 05:09.757
Give her a chance, you know?

05:11.311 --> 05:13.081
- I hate that he's
trying to replace mom.

05:13.105 --> 05:15.211
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:17.282 --> 05:18.742
Shawn,

05:20.941 --> 05:23.057
it's been three years, buddy.

05:23.081 --> 05:25.991
I know that doesn't
seem like a long time

05:26.015 --> 05:28.131
but Dad's gotta move on

05:28.155 --> 05:31.089
and Shannon is
helping him do that.

05:32.987 --> 05:33.987
Look at me.

05:34.955 --> 05:37.347
Nobody can replace mom.

05:37.371 --> 05:38.371
Nobody.

05:39.718 --> 05:41.144
Wherever she is,

05:41.168 --> 05:44.320
she'd want Dad to
be happy, right?

05:44.344 --> 05:46.725
- Yeah, I guess you're right.

05:47.726 --> 05:49.704
- Of course I'm right.

05:51.247 --> 05:53.708
Besides, Shannon comes with a
really cool little sister.

05:54.561 --> 05:55.572
- Step sister.

05:55.596 --> 05:56.401
She stinks.

05:56.425 --> 05:57.402
- Okay.

05:57.426 --> 05:59.127
She's a really cool,
smelly little sister.

05:59.151 --> 06:01.682
- Well you don't have
to live with her.

06:01.706 --> 06:03.960
- And give us life everlasting.

06:03.984 --> 06:04.984
Amen.

06:08.920 --> 06:11.750
- Where in the hell
is that woman?

06:22.865 --> 06:24.384
Goddamn it, woman.

06:25.661 --> 06:26.810
50 years ago,

06:26.834 --> 06:31.781
you used to be this hot
little, spunky Italian thing.

06:31.805 --> 06:35.222
Now you're ugly and
slower than molasses.

06:38.259 --> 06:40.030
And what the heck
are you needing

06:40.054 --> 06:43.620
to pray for a whole
hour about anyway, huh?

06:43.644 --> 06:46.589
- I was praying for
your soul, dear.

06:46.613 --> 06:49.557
And that the good Lord
would take it soon.

06:49.581 --> 06:52.560
- Well the sooner the
better, girlfriend.

06:52.584 --> 06:55.701
Now I hope you didn't hide my
pill bottle from me this time.

06:55.725 --> 06:57.979
- And why would I do that?

06:58.003 --> 06:58.946
- What?

06:58.970 --> 07:00.534
- And why would I do that?!

07:00.558 --> 07:01.397
- Damn.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.433
I swear, between my bad hearing

07:03.457 --> 07:06.850
and you talking like you got
a mouth full of oatmeal,

07:06.874 --> 07:09.463
no wonder we don't communicate.

07:14.295 --> 07:17.240
- Loving the tunes
out here, bro.

07:17.264 --> 07:19.162
What you reading, dork?

07:20.129 --> 07:23.039
"Fire Fighter's Manual
to Disaster Prevention."

07:23.063 --> 07:24.592
You wanna be a fireman now?

07:24.616 --> 07:25.869
- Uncle Steve gave it to me.

07:25.893 --> 07:26.905
He thought I'd like it

07:26.929 --> 07:28.649
because of my interest
in extraterrestrials.

07:28.673 --> 07:30.356
- Extraterrestrials?

07:30.380 --> 07:31.357
It's a fireman's book.

07:31.381 --> 07:33.187
What's it got to do with ET?

07:33.211 --> 07:35.085
- Right now I'm
reading chapter 16.

07:35.109 --> 07:38.917
It's talking about the potential
of UFO invasion, right?

07:38.941 --> 07:40.884
And it says that fireman are

07:40.908 --> 07:43.197
our first line of
defense against aliens.

07:43.221 --> 07:44.060
- What?

07:44.084 --> 07:45.199
- No way.
- Yeah.

07:45.223 --> 07:46.200
- You're messing with me.

07:46.224 --> 07:48.202
- Dude, it even gets
into how radiation

07:48.226 --> 07:50.100
is an alien's natural defense.

07:50.124 --> 07:51.895
It's really detailed.

07:51.919 --> 07:53.932
- That's crazy.

07:53.956 --> 07:55.727
- Why would a fire
officer's book

07:55.751 --> 07:57.970
have something about
an alien invasion?

07:57.994 --> 08:01.387
- It was written in 1992 by
two veteran fire officers,

08:01.411 --> 08:05.150
one of which witnessed the
Los Angeles air raid of '42.

08:05.174 --> 08:06.841
- Los Angeles air raid?

08:06.865 --> 08:08.153
What is that?

08:08.177 --> 08:09.350
- Oh, come on.

08:10.593 --> 08:12.215
Are you kidding me?

08:13.976 --> 08:15.022
- No, nothing.

08:15.046 --> 08:15.850
- Oh god.

08:15.874 --> 08:17.058
- Sorry, space man.

08:17.082 --> 08:18.750
- I can't believe
you're my brother.

08:18.774 --> 08:21.235
- Hey, the feeling is mutual.

08:24.055 --> 08:26.482
- All right, well, it was 1942,

08:26.506 --> 08:28.138
three months after
the US declared

08:28.162 --> 08:29.933
their part in World War II,

08:29.957 --> 08:33.005
when the Los Angeles Air Defense
Unit went into full affect

08:33.029 --> 08:35.249
for the first time ever.

08:35.273 --> 08:36.871
Army forts all across
the coast line

08:36.895 --> 08:39.563
fired thousands of shells
into the night sky

08:39.587 --> 08:41.427
and then they just stopped.

08:41.451 --> 08:43.878
The event is still in
question to this day.

08:43.902 --> 08:45.604
- That is insane.

08:45.628 --> 08:46.881
- Yeah, right?

08:46.905 --> 08:48.573
- Well, hey, maybe it was just,

08:48.597 --> 08:50.264
you know, like a
training exercise

08:50.288 --> 08:52.577
masked as an alien
invasion, right?

08:52.601 --> 08:55.189
Scare the masses, mind control.

08:56.605 --> 09:00.446
- Or it coulda been the aliens
doing a little experiment.

09:00.470 --> 09:03.715
Trying to test our
military's defenses.

09:06.476 --> 09:08.109
- Speaking of experiment,

09:08.133 --> 09:09.687
I think we're here.

09:11.930 --> 09:14.737
- Oh, this is gonna be awesome.

09:28.878 --> 09:31.477
- I'm just saying, where
did you put my pill?

09:31.501 --> 09:33.583
- In the medicine cabinet.

09:33.607 --> 09:37.622
- Yeah, even though I take
them at the damn table.

09:54.490 --> 09:55.871
What in Sam Hill?

09:56.837 --> 09:58.366
- Oh my.

09:58.390 --> 09:59.367
Is it dead?

09:59.391 --> 10:01.266
Oh, it looks really sick.

10:01.290 --> 10:03.889
Maybe we should call a vet.

10:04.742 --> 10:05.822
- A vet?

10:05.846 --> 10:07.806
What the heck's that look
like to you, woman, huh?

10:07.830 --> 10:09.446
A chihuahua?

10:09.470 --> 10:10.275
- Oh no.

10:10.299 --> 10:11.299
I, no, I...

10:13.958 --> 10:15.028
- Call a vet.

10:16.098 --> 10:18.697
Oughta have one take your
butt out to pasture.

10:19.757 --> 10:20.757
- Oh my.

10:22.138 --> 10:23.737
- I swear, if Roberto's
been feeding

10:23.761 --> 10:25.842
these damn cows churros again,

10:25.866 --> 10:28.604
I'll send his butt
back to Mexico.

10:30.595 --> 10:33.022
It's all right, girl.

10:33.046 --> 10:35.565
We'll just take a look at you.

10:37.982 --> 10:39.856
I think she's pregnant.

10:39.880 --> 10:40.961
- Aw!

11:05.319 --> 11:06.469
- That kid's gotta start
getting in the habit

11:06.493 --> 11:08.091
of telling me where he's going.

11:08.115 --> 11:10.355
He can't just bolt out of here
first thing in the morning

11:10.379 --> 11:11.957
without giving me
his exact location.

11:11.981 --> 11:13.752
That's enough water.

11:13.776 --> 11:15.996
And letting me know when
he's gonna be home.

11:16.020 --> 11:17.460
- You really want
his exact location,

11:17.484 --> 11:19.206
why don't you just put
a GPS in his tush

11:19.230 --> 11:21.139
and you'll know
where he is 24/7.

11:21.163 --> 11:22.519
- A GPS, huh?

11:22.543 --> 11:24.063
You know, I'm the
sheriff in this town.

11:24.087 --> 11:25.029
I can make that happen.

11:25.053 --> 11:25.730
- Oh.

11:25.754 --> 11:27.154
- Might go against
the Constitution,

11:27.178 --> 11:28.836
but hey, he's my kid.

11:28.860 --> 11:30.389
I can enslave him
all I want, right?

11:30.413 --> 11:32.288
- That's right because
you're the sheriff.

11:32.312 --> 11:33.116
- That's right.

11:33.140 --> 11:34.140
- Ew.

11:38.364 --> 11:39.564
- I know he told us he's doing

11:39.588 --> 11:41.193
his science experiment
with Michael.

11:41.217 --> 11:42.857
- I don't remember him
mentioning anything

11:42.881 --> 11:44.714
about a science
experiment with Michael.

11:44.738 --> 11:46.716
- Well, he told me.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.380
- Well that's just what
I'm talking about.

11:48.404 --> 11:49.029
He tells you.

11:49.053 --> 11:50.306
He doesn't tell me anything.

11:50.330 --> 11:53.447
Doesn't respect me, doesn't
respect the rules of the house.

11:53.471 --> 11:57.475
You know, the kid's got
me on a pain on my list.

12:00.478 --> 12:02.628
It's gotta stop.

12:02.652 --> 12:04.872
- I just think it's little
difficult for him, you know?

12:04.896 --> 12:06.425
With us living here together.

12:06.449 --> 12:07.772
It's gotta be hard.

12:07.796 --> 12:09.236
Why don't you just
give him some time

12:09.260 --> 12:10.326
and a little bit of space?

12:10.350 --> 12:11.292
- Space?

12:11.316 --> 12:13.881
Shannon, have you
seen this kid's room?

12:13.905 --> 12:16.356
The kid lives in space, okay?

12:17.460 --> 12:20.025
I mean, he sits in
there 24/7, you know?

12:20.049 --> 12:22.787
He's playing on his little
gadgets and his games.

12:22.811 --> 12:24.927
When he does emerge
from his star ship,

12:24.951 --> 12:26.445
he comes out here for dinner,

12:26.469 --> 12:28.378
zone out on that tablet thing

12:28.402 --> 12:30.795
and turns into a zombie.

12:30.819 --> 12:32.244
- I've asked him not to do that.

12:32.268 --> 12:34.246
- Well, we have
to ask him again.

12:34.270 --> 12:36.076
He should get outside
every once and awhile.

12:36.100 --> 12:37.284
Play some sports.

12:37.308 --> 12:39.562
- Emily, don't do that.

12:39.586 --> 12:41.702
- Do him some good.

12:41.726 --> 12:43.635
Get a little exercise.

12:43.659 --> 12:44.705
- Right.

12:44.729 --> 12:46.051
- Heck, at this point,
I wouldn't mind

12:46.075 --> 12:47.432
if he got into a little
trouble now and then.

12:47.456 --> 12:48.744
- Yeah, he's never
gonna be like Michael.

12:48.768 --> 12:49.606
You know that, right?

12:49.630 --> 12:50.884
- I'm not saying that, okay?

12:50.908 --> 12:53.093
I'm just saying the
behavior has got to stop.

12:53.117 --> 12:55.360
It has been going on since.

12:59.986 --> 13:01.722
- You know,

13:01.746 --> 13:04.656
I just think the kids
still miss their mom.

13:04.680 --> 13:05.622
You know?

13:05.646 --> 13:08.418
I think they're still grieving.

13:08.442 --> 13:12.930
So why don't you just show
up and show them some love?

13:22.836 --> 13:23.836
- Hello?

13:25.701 --> 13:26.701
What?

13:28.877 --> 13:29.877
Okay, okay.

13:30.671 --> 13:33.443
I'll be out there in 15 minutes.

13:33.467 --> 13:35.262
Why, is she conscious?

13:37.264 --> 13:41.727
Well have Steve and his guys
go out to the farm ASAP.

13:41.751 --> 13:44.834
As old as she is, she's
gonna need an ambulance.

13:44.858 --> 13:47.585
Robert, yes, the
whole treatment.

13:48.390 --> 13:49.390
All right.

13:49.414 --> 13:50.414
Yep.

13:53.775 --> 13:54.775
- Chief!

13:54.799 --> 13:55.603
- Yeah?

13:55.627 --> 13:56.432
- Forgot your lunch.

13:56.456 --> 13:57.674
- Oh, thank you.

13:57.698 --> 13:59.573
- You're welcome.

13:59.597 --> 14:01.368
Don't forget, Emily's
softball game is today.

14:01.392 --> 14:03.266
- Oh, how could I
forget that, huh?

14:03.290 --> 14:05.544
You're gonna choke up on
that bat like I taught you.

14:05.568 --> 14:06.442
- Yeah, I will.

14:06.466 --> 14:07.719
- I'll be rooting for you.

14:07.743 --> 14:08.951
- Okay, thanks.

14:09.883 --> 14:10.883
- Oh!

14:12.587 --> 14:13.587
- Whoa!

14:13.611 --> 14:14.415
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

14:14.439 --> 14:15.761
- Be careful out there.

14:15.785 --> 14:16.590
- Are you kidding?

14:16.614 --> 14:17.936
In this town?

14:17.960 --> 14:18.960
- Love you.

14:19.928 --> 14:21.250
- Okay, here we are...

14:21.274 --> 14:22.274
Shoot.

14:23.391 --> 14:24.391
Okay.

14:24.415 --> 14:26.082
Here we are at base camp 237,

14:26.106 --> 14:30.397
beginning phase one of
Operation Moon Ballon.

14:30.421 --> 14:33.503
As you can see, this is my
lovely assistant, Michael.

14:33.527 --> 14:35.540
He's my biological brother.

14:35.564 --> 14:38.336
Why and how I'm related to
such an inferior species,

14:38.360 --> 14:40.234
my mind will never comprehend.

14:40.258 --> 14:41.684
- Want me to drop
this on your head?

14:41.708 --> 14:43.065
- No, you may continue.

15:01.555 --> 15:02.843
- Come on, Robert.

15:02.867 --> 15:04.006
What the hell?

15:31.896 --> 15:32.942
Robert?

15:32.966 --> 15:34.979
Is all that tape
really necessary?

15:35.003 --> 15:36.003
- Hey, Sheriff.

15:37.074 --> 15:38.361
- Christ, Steve.

15:38.385 --> 15:39.638
- Every time, so good.

15:39.662 --> 15:41.261
- Man, how many times
have I told you?

15:41.285 --> 15:43.988
You can not do stuff
like that on site.

15:44.012 --> 15:45.403
It's unprofessional.

15:45.427 --> 15:46.611
- Yeah.

15:46.635 --> 15:48.268
Do I work for you?

15:48.292 --> 15:49.234
Oh no, that's right.

15:49.258 --> 15:50.615
Barney Fife does.

15:50.639 --> 15:51.443
Tough break.

15:51.467 --> 15:52.272
- Real funny.

15:52.296 --> 15:53.100
Wise ass.

15:53.124 --> 15:53.963
- Good to see you.

15:53.987 --> 15:55.299
- Yeah, you too.

15:56.817 --> 15:58.543
You are unbelievable.

16:02.099 --> 16:03.559
And you.

16:03.583 --> 16:06.320
Robert, did you get a little
tape-happy this morning?

16:06.344 --> 16:07.356
What's the story there?

16:07.380 --> 16:08.820
- Sorry if I went a
little overboard.

16:08.844 --> 16:11.912
It's not everyday I get to set
up an office crime scene.

16:11.936 --> 16:14.217
- I gave him a coloring book
to try and keep him occupied.

16:14.241 --> 16:16.123
But the tape was just too shiny.

16:16.147 --> 16:17.747
- You know what, ever
since we were kids,

16:17.771 --> 16:19.093
it's always with the jokes.

16:19.117 --> 16:21.473
Are you ever gonna grow up?

16:21.497 --> 16:23.027
- You're right.

16:23.051 --> 16:24.752
Serious question though.

16:24.776 --> 16:26.927
Does Carol have your balls
in a jar beneath the sink

16:26.951 --> 16:28.391
or is it like a
Tupperware situation?

16:28.415 --> 16:29.550
- See?

16:29.574 --> 16:31.932
- All right, guys, enough of
the shenanigans you guys.

16:31.956 --> 16:34.866
I's too early in the morning
for this, all right?

16:34.890 --> 16:36.523
- What crawled up your butt?

16:36.547 --> 16:37.558
- Sorry.

16:37.582 --> 16:40.216
Michael came and picked
up Shawn this morning.

16:40.240 --> 16:41.873
Didn't tell me where
they're going.

16:41.897 --> 16:42.943
Don't know where they are.

16:42.967 --> 16:44.567
- You want me to put
it out on the radio?

16:44.591 --> 16:45.871
Have the fellas keep an eye out?

16:45.895 --> 16:47.154
- No.

16:47.178 --> 16:49.018
It's okay, Robert.

16:49.042 --> 16:52.056
So what's the story
with Martha, here?

16:52.080 --> 16:53.574
Did she and Ted get
into it again?

16:53.598 --> 16:55.059
- Honestly, man,

16:55.083 --> 16:57.647
none of this makes any sense.

16:57.671 --> 16:59.711
- We did get some of the
story from dispatch though.

16:59.735 --> 17:00.547
- What'd you hear?

17:00.571 --> 17:02.445
- Well, Roberto,
caretaker of the place,

17:02.469 --> 17:04.861
says he hears Martha
screaming bloody murder.

17:04.885 --> 17:07.209
Takes off from the barn
over there, comes over.

17:07.233 --> 17:09.521
Finds her on the ground
screaming, "The tall man!"

17:09.545 --> 17:12.179
"The tall man took
Ted into the field!"

17:12.203 --> 17:13.939
And then she passes out.

17:13.963 --> 17:15.631
- And she ran, what?

17:15.655 --> 17:16.632
All the way from the truck.

17:16.656 --> 17:18.047
That's gotta be 80 yards.

17:18.070 --> 17:18.979
Something like that.

17:19.002 --> 17:21.085
- More like, about 91.

17:21.108 --> 17:23.224
- I might say an even 88.

17:23.249 --> 17:24.529
- You didn't even play football.

17:24.553 --> 17:26.262
- Okay, so it was a
touchdown, right?

17:26.286 --> 17:27.367
Are we agreed on that?

17:27.391 --> 17:28.471
A football field.

17:28.494 --> 17:29.817
- Something must've scared
the bejesus out of her

17:29.841 --> 17:31.302
for her to run that far.

17:31.326 --> 17:32.648
She is not a runner.

17:32.672 --> 17:35.099
- No, she's real old.

17:35.123 --> 17:36.307
- Thanks, Steve.

17:36.331 --> 17:37.929
What about the dead cow?

17:37.953 --> 17:38.792
Animal attack?

17:38.816 --> 17:40.069
Coyote maybe?

17:40.093 --> 17:42.727
- I'm not so sure about that

17:42.751 --> 17:47.076
but it looks like the stomach
just kind of exploded.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.147
- Roberto would know if they
had any coyote problems

17:49.171 --> 17:50.631
around here, wouldn't he?

17:50.655 --> 17:52.116
- Maybe.

17:52.140 --> 17:53.945
- Hey, Roberto.

18:22.423 --> 18:23.423
- Translation?

18:23.447 --> 18:24.976
- Basically, when he
was a little kid,

18:25.000 --> 18:26.805
his grandma used to
tell him stories

18:26.829 --> 18:29.360
about a creature or
something called a Kukulkan

18:29.384 --> 18:31.224
and it'd come get him if
he didn't go to sleep.

18:31.248 --> 18:34.641
But he's saying it's
real and it's here.

18:34.665 --> 18:36.056
- The Kukulkan?

18:36.080 --> 18:37.989
And what is that, exactly?

18:49.473 --> 18:50.646
- War serpent.

18:52.038 --> 18:53.038
- Great.

18:53.062 --> 18:54.385
Appreciate it, chief.

18:54.409 --> 18:55.409
Adios.

18:56.963 --> 18:58.665
- So he speaks English?

18:58.689 --> 19:00.356
- Apparently.

19:07.663 --> 19:09.503
- Okay, here we are at
our command center,

19:09.527 --> 19:13.024
where we have our trusted
computers, a hard drive and...

19:13.048 --> 19:16.752
Just start with an introduction
of myself and the project.

19:16.776 --> 19:18.778
I'll edit this in later.

19:20.642 --> 19:23.068
Hi, I'm Shawn Neary and
I'm about to embark

19:23.092 --> 19:24.656
on an ambitious mission.

19:24.680 --> 19:26.555
I will be the
youngest scientist...

19:26.579 --> 19:29.005
- You're not a scientist.

19:29.029 --> 19:31.860
- I will be the
youngest scientist

19:32.861 --> 19:35.909
to send a camera 20 miles
into the upper atmosphere

19:35.933 --> 19:38.636
and capture amateur
video of space.

19:38.660 --> 19:39.602
Okay.

19:39.626 --> 19:41.146
Here, we have our
trusty command center

19:41.170 --> 19:44.228
where we have our laptops
and my mini satellite dish

19:44.252 --> 19:46.954
which will hopefully receive
and record video signal

19:46.978 --> 19:50.751
from our space shuttle,
the Neary One.

19:50.775 --> 19:53.306
She will transmit, via live
feed, to the computers,

19:53.330 --> 19:55.687
which will then download
on to a hard drive and...

19:59.059 --> 20:02.142
What the heck do you
think you're doing?

20:02.166 --> 20:03.316
- Trying to annoy you.

20:03.340 --> 20:05.663
- Well you succeeded.

20:05.687 --> 20:08.252
- I'm messing with you, bro.

20:08.276 --> 20:10.323
Look, your project's
going to be a success.

20:10.347 --> 20:13.774
I'm here to help you
all I can, okay?

20:13.798 --> 20:15.051
- Hey, man,

20:15.075 --> 20:17.435
thanks for using your spring
break to help me out with this.

20:17.459 --> 20:19.644
It means a lot and I'm just
glad you decided to come.

20:19.668 --> 20:20.540
- Of course.

20:20.564 --> 20:22.127
I'm always here for you, bro.

20:22.151 --> 20:24.302
Besides, college
has many breaks.

20:24.326 --> 20:27.236
The whole thing is pretty much
one big vacation actually.

20:27.260 --> 20:28.133
You'll see.

20:28.157 --> 20:29.721
- Actually, college
isn't necessary.

20:29.745 --> 20:31.965
This project is my
application to Sky Watch.

20:31.989 --> 20:33.104
- Sky Watch?

20:33.128 --> 20:34.174
What's Sky Watch?

20:34.198 --> 20:35.037
- They're a group of people

20:35.061 --> 20:36.381
at the University
of Puerto Rico's

20:36.405 --> 20:38.109
Lunar and Planetary Laboratory.

20:38.133 --> 20:40.456
They study the statistics
of comets and asteroids

20:40.480 --> 20:42.355
in order to investigate
the dynamic evolution

20:42.379 --> 20:44.011
of the solar system.

20:44.035 --> 20:45.323
- Okay, Einstein.

20:45.347 --> 20:47.187
Before you go shipping
off into deep space,

20:47.211 --> 20:49.293
why don't you show me
how all this works?

20:49.317 --> 20:52.848
- Einstein was a physicist,
not an astronomer.

20:52.872 --> 20:53.849
- Yes.

20:53.873 --> 20:55.115
Yes, of course.

20:56.185 --> 20:58.233
- All right, Robert, I
want you to get back.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.027
Put out an APB on this
tall man, all right?

21:00.051 --> 21:01.788
Anybody over six feet.

21:01.812 --> 21:03.859
Any stranger's gonna
stick out in this town.

21:03.883 --> 21:04.825
- Yes, sir.

21:04.849 --> 21:06.369
- You don't think
that' a little vague?

21:06.393 --> 21:07.518
Anybody over six feet?

21:07.542 --> 21:08.726
Hello, I could be a suspect.

21:08.750 --> 21:11.004
- Why would that
surprise anyone?

21:11.028 --> 21:11.832
- Nice.

21:11.856 --> 21:12.976
- I'll get on it right away.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.357
- So Ted was taken into a field.

21:14.381 --> 21:15.802
Do we know where this field is?

21:15.826 --> 21:18.805
I would assume there's a trail.

21:18.829 --> 21:20.289
- Yes.

21:20.313 --> 21:21.117
- Yes.

21:21.141 --> 21:21.946
- Yes.

21:21.970 --> 21:24.431
- And did we follow it, guys?

21:24.455 --> 21:25.294
- Yes.

21:25.318 --> 21:26.122
- Yes?

21:26.146 --> 21:27.054
Good answer.

21:27.078 --> 21:28.839
And what did we find?

21:29.667 --> 21:31.024
What?

21:31.048 --> 21:32.048
What?

21:32.946 --> 21:34.959
- Let's show him the slime.

21:34.983 --> 21:35.983
- Slime?

22:15.092 --> 22:16.196
What is that?

22:23.411 --> 22:24.929
- That...

22:26.172 --> 22:28.588
We have no idea what that is.

22:36.113 --> 22:37.435
- Robert, get back
to the office.

22:37.459 --> 22:39.057
Get going on that
APB, all right?

22:39.081 --> 22:40.611
- Yes sir, right away.

22:40.635 --> 22:42.198
- Hey.

22:42.222 --> 22:43.924
Let me know as soon
as Martha wakes up.

22:43.948 --> 22:44.891
- Yes, sir.

22:44.915 --> 22:46.195
- I wanna get a statement going.

22:46.219 --> 22:47.549
I wanna get a composite as well.

22:47.573 --> 22:50.552
- Okay, who do you wanna
use to do the composite?

22:50.576 --> 22:51.656
I've seen Polly's art.

22:51.680 --> 22:52.519
It aint that good.

22:52.543 --> 22:53.555
- Why don't you try Jane?

22:53.579 --> 22:54.694
She's a pretty good artist.

22:54.718 --> 22:55.729
- Emily's teacher?

22:55.753 --> 22:57.513
- Ask her if she'll do
us a favor, all right?

22:57.537 --> 22:59.273
- Okay, I'm on it.

23:04.417 --> 23:06.222
- You know, if Ted
was indeed dragged

23:06.246 --> 23:08.397
through this whole cornfield,

23:08.421 --> 23:11.883
he would've broken every
bone in his body.

23:11.907 --> 23:13.057
Right?

23:13.081 --> 23:15.161
- Whoever was dragging him
woulda been having to move

23:15.185 --> 23:17.648
at a pretty fast clip
to clear this path.

23:17.672 --> 23:19.304
- Yeah,

23:19.328 --> 23:21.089
but there's no blood.

23:22.228 --> 23:23.609
- That's not all.

23:27.233 --> 23:29.591
Hey, come on, look at this.

23:34.620 --> 23:35.620
- Oh man.

23:36.656 --> 23:38.071
What in the hell?

23:40.223 --> 23:41.223
- I don't get it, man.

23:41.247 --> 23:42.807
How can somebody drag
a guy through this

23:42.831 --> 23:46.815
and then just disappear
like it's nothing?

23:46.839 --> 23:48.886
You think we're dealing
with a real murder case?

23:48.910 --> 23:50.094
- Steve, slow down, man.

23:50.118 --> 23:51.440
You know,

23:51.464 --> 23:52.993
we don't even have a body yet.

23:53.017 --> 23:53.960
For all I know,

23:53.984 --> 23:56.411
Ted could be chasing
one of his cows,

23:56.435 --> 23:59.241
trying to stop it from getting
away, man, I don't know.

23:59.265 --> 24:01.185
Look, I'm not gonna start
jumping to conclusions.

24:01.209 --> 24:02.289
I don't want the whole town

24:02.313 --> 24:05.109
getting into a panic
over nothing.

24:05.133 --> 24:06.134
- All right.

24:09.378 --> 24:13.462
- This is way more than you
and I can handle alone, man.

24:13.486 --> 24:15.246
We're gonna have to get
a search party going.

24:15.270 --> 24:16.051
- Okay.

24:16.075 --> 24:17.259
You want me to call my guys?

24:17.283 --> 24:18.329
- No.

24:18.353 --> 24:19.537
Keep them as backup.

24:19.561 --> 24:21.321
Let's get some of the
local farmers involved,

24:21.345 --> 24:23.507
see if they'd be
willing to help out.

24:23.531 --> 24:24.818
Ted's 89 years old.

24:24.842 --> 24:27.062
You know, I mean,

24:27.086 --> 24:29.271
he can't be that far.

24:32.919 --> 24:33.919
- Or can he?

24:36.302 --> 24:39.270
- Oh, will you give
me a break, man?

24:40.513 --> 24:43.458
- Momma always said you
were closed-minded.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.839
- Dad always said
you were gullible.

24:45.863 --> 24:46.863
- Good one.

24:51.351 --> 24:54.182
He didn't really
say that, did he?

24:58.945 --> 25:00.647
That's messed up.

25:00.671 --> 25:01.845
Be safe, dude.

25:02.777 --> 25:05.480
- You too, brother.

25:21.105 --> 25:23.073
- Continuing on.

25:25.075 --> 25:26.663
- You ready, Shawn?

25:31.668 --> 25:33.128
- This is the Neary One

25:33.152 --> 25:34.632
and we are going to
send it into space

25:34.656 --> 25:36.407
with the help of a
weather balloon.

25:36.431 --> 25:37.891
Here, in the forward
control thrust,

25:37.915 --> 25:39.065
we have a pen-sized camera

25:39.089 --> 25:41.895
which will record 24 frames
per second at 1080p HD

25:41.919 --> 25:43.863
into the internal hard drive.

25:43.887 --> 25:46.417
Down here, under the belly, we
have a GPS tracking device,

25:46.441 --> 25:48.523
which transmits coordinates
to my GPS tracker

25:48.547 --> 25:50.041
down here on Earth.

25:50.065 --> 25:52.147
Now, I estimate that
the weather balloon

25:52.171 --> 25:54.563
should carry the
Neary One 20 miles

25:54.587 --> 25:57.117
or 105 thousand, 600 feet.

25:57.141 --> 26:00.086
Just scratching the
upper atmosphere.

26:00.110 --> 26:01.812
As it reaches max altitude,

26:01.836 --> 26:03.330
the weather ballon will burst

26:03.354 --> 26:05.056
and the parachute will deploy,

26:05.080 --> 26:06.748
slowing it's decent to Earth.

26:06.772 --> 26:08.646
I should capture
amazing footage,

26:08.670 --> 26:11.028
never before recorded
by a civilian.

26:11.052 --> 26:13.237
Ever since the day John F.
Kennedy announced

26:13.261 --> 26:15.066
his mission to the
moon until today,

26:15.090 --> 26:16.896
NASA owned the skies.

26:16.920 --> 26:20.071
Today, I, Shawn Neary,
will go where no man...

26:20.095 --> 26:20.900
- Boy.

26:20.924 --> 26:22.442
- Has gone before.

26:37.630 --> 26:39.781
Okay, it's a beautiful
day with low winds

26:39.805 --> 26:42.300
and the FAA has given
us clearance to launch.

26:42.324 --> 26:44.199
As you can see, the Neary
One's been equipped

26:44.223 --> 26:45.890
with the necessary devices

26:45.914 --> 26:49.987
and is now being attached
to the weather balloon.

26:53.370 --> 26:54.570
Okay, now we're going to begin

26:54.594 --> 26:57.805
filling the weather
ballon with helium.

27:06.555 --> 27:08.844
No, you're doing it wrong.

27:30.372 --> 27:32.316
- Let's go, guys! Out
of the truck, come on!

27:32.340 --> 27:33.904
Get the cargo, let's go!

27:33.928 --> 27:35.526
Off the lid, on the ground.

27:35.550 --> 27:37.379
Let's go, double time!

27:54.684 --> 27:55.684
- Hold, sir.

27:55.708 --> 27:56.961
- Whoa, easy.

27:56.985 --> 27:58.722
What's going on here?

27:58.746 --> 28:00.171
- Nothing to worry about, sir.

28:00.195 --> 28:02.622
We're just preparing for a
routine training exercise.

28:02.646 --> 28:04.935
- Routine training exercise?

28:04.959 --> 28:06.005
On whose authority?

28:06.029 --> 28:07.385
- The United States Army.

28:07.409 --> 28:08.732
I'm Corporal Carpio

28:08.756 --> 28:11.596
and local authorities have
been notified by my superiors.

28:11.620 --> 28:12.528
Again, sir,

28:12.552 --> 28:13.357
this is just a...

28:13.381 --> 28:14.703
- Routine training
exercise, yeah.

28:14.727 --> 28:16.912
I get it corporal.

28:16.936 --> 28:18.396
What I don't get is, one,

28:18.420 --> 28:19.984
I'm the only authority
in this town

28:20.008 --> 28:21.528
and I haven't been
notified of anything

28:21.552 --> 28:26.178
and two, this base has been
abandoned for over a decade.

28:27.050 --> 28:30.546
Listen, as small
as this town is,

28:30.570 --> 28:32.445
I'm responsible for
the people in it.

28:32.469 --> 28:34.930
If there's something going on,

28:34.954 --> 28:37.070
I need do know about it.

28:37.094 --> 28:38.623
- Sir,

28:38.647 --> 28:42.790
we'll let you know if your
assistance is required.

28:44.826 --> 28:47.173
Have to get back to my post.

28:53.041 --> 28:54.041
- Right.

28:56.942 --> 29:01.878
Why do I have a feeling I won't
be getting that phone call?

29:08.608 --> 29:11.760
- Okay, let's start
the countdown.

29:11.784 --> 29:15.005
We're go for liftoff
in T-minus ten,

29:15.029 --> 29:16.420
nine,

29:16.444 --> 29:17.559
eight,

29:17.583 --> 29:18.802
seven,

29:18.826 --> 29:20.113
six,

29:20.137 --> 29:21.528
five,

29:21.552 --> 29:23.185
four,

29:23.209 --> 29:24.773
three,

29:24.797 --> 29:26.188
two,

29:26.212 --> 29:27.362
one.

29:27.386 --> 29:28.386
Ignition.

29:30.113 --> 29:31.815
We have liftoff!

29:48.441 --> 29:49.615
Catch it, mom.

29:56.967 --> 29:59.556
- Robert, in my office, please.

30:02.835 --> 30:04.054
- Yes, sir?

30:04.078 --> 30:05.089
- First off,

30:05.113 --> 30:06.608
how many times do I
have to tell you?

30:06.632 --> 30:08.713
Stop with the "sir," okay?

30:08.737 --> 30:10.301
- You're my superior, John.

30:10.325 --> 30:11.565
I think it's only professional.

30:11.589 --> 30:13.166
- Look, as your
superior officer,

30:13.190 --> 30:14.719
I'm ordering you,

30:14.743 --> 30:17.308
stop with the "sir," okay?

30:17.332 --> 30:18.332
- Yes...

30:19.507 --> 30:20.691
All right.

30:20.715 --> 30:22.003
- Okay.

30:22.027 --> 30:23.907
Now have we gotten any
calls into this is office

30:23.931 --> 30:25.903
about the army moving
into the old base,

30:25.927 --> 30:28.009
conducting some kind
of training exercise?

30:28.033 --> 30:29.389
- No call from the army.

30:29.413 --> 30:31.633
But we did get a lot of
calls from the locals

30:31.657 --> 30:34.878
who sure noticed their
presence in town today.

30:34.902 --> 30:35.844
- Yeah, yeah.

30:35.868 --> 30:36.845
I mean, how can you miss them?

30:36.869 --> 30:38.157
They're rolling in like
they own the place.

30:38.181 --> 30:40.055
I haven't seen anybody
over in that old base,

30:40.079 --> 30:42.747
except for old Henry when
he's cutting the grass.

30:42.771 --> 30:45.026
- Yeah, he has a contract
with the government

30:45.050 --> 30:47.407
to keep the place
operational, I think.

30:47.431 --> 30:48.408
Do you want me to
give him a call

30:48.432 --> 30:49.927
and see if he knows anything?

30:49.951 --> 30:50.790
- Yeah.

30:50.814 --> 30:52.757
Yeah, that wouldn't hurt.

30:52.781 --> 30:54.922
- There is something else.

30:56.613 --> 30:58.487
- Plate's not full enough today?

30:58.511 --> 30:59.764
What is it?

30:59.788 --> 31:02.069
- I stopped by the McTiernan
farm on the way back in town.

31:02.093 --> 31:04.528
All two dozen of their
cows were found dead

31:04.552 --> 31:06.047
with their stomachs burst open.

31:06.071 --> 31:07.462
Just like Ted's place.

31:07.486 --> 31:08.290
- What?

31:08.314 --> 31:09.902
- Yep and no blood.

31:12.180 --> 31:15.228
- So now it's Ted's farm and
the McTiernan's, right?

31:15.252 --> 31:16.195
- Uh uh.

31:16.219 --> 31:18.128
We're actually having
similar reports in

31:18.152 --> 31:19.819
from the entire county.

31:19.843 --> 31:21.338
- What?

31:21.362 --> 31:24.720
- Not to ruin the wonderful,
god-given experience,

31:24.744 --> 31:26.964
but it's almost like...

31:26.988 --> 31:27.989
- Like what?

31:28.794 --> 31:29.794
Like what, Robert?

31:29.818 --> 31:31.072
Don't keep me in suspense.

31:31.096 --> 31:33.729
- Like when my wife
gave birth to our kids.

31:33.753 --> 31:34.938
- Okay, thanks for that.

31:34.962 --> 31:35.800
- No blood.

31:35.824 --> 31:38.769
Just this oozing
slime and wet air.

31:38.793 --> 31:40.667
- Okay, yes, thank
you for the image,

31:40.691 --> 31:41.945
I appreciate it.

31:41.969 --> 31:44.361
All right, get some deputies
out to these farms.

31:44.385 --> 31:45.845
Start getting some
statements going.

31:45.869 --> 31:46.984
I wanna know what kind of issues

31:47.008 --> 31:48.608
they've been having
with their livestock.

31:48.632 --> 31:50.023
When it all started happening.

31:50.047 --> 31:50.919
- Will do.

31:50.943 --> 31:52.863
Do you think this could
be some kind of pandemic?

31:52.887 --> 31:54.372
- Highly doubt it.

31:55.430 --> 31:56.925
Lord help us if it is.

31:56.949 --> 32:00.825
I mean, we're not equipped to
deal with anything like this.

32:00.849 --> 32:03.587
- John, we just got a
call from the hospital.

32:03.611 --> 32:06.279
Martha just woke up and she's
speaking with the nurses.

32:06.303 --> 32:07.315
- Good, good.

32:07.339 --> 32:08.350
All right.

32:08.374 --> 32:10.254
Robert, have Steve call
me over at the hospital.

32:10.278 --> 32:11.871
I wanna get that
search up, ASAP.

32:11.895 --> 32:14.176
- Sure thing but don't you want
me with you on the search?

32:14.200 --> 32:15.668
- No, Steve and I
got that covered.

32:15.692 --> 32:18.291
I want you to start on those
statements, all right?

32:18.315 --> 32:19.396
And call Henry.

32:19.420 --> 32:21.260
I wanna know what's going
on at that army base.

32:21.284 --> 32:22.975
- Okay. Right away.

32:24.632 --> 32:29.533
- Oh and don't forget Emily's
softball game this afternoon.

32:43.312 --> 32:44.352
- Well assuming this thing

32:44.376 --> 32:46.733
didn't get sucked
into a jet engine,

32:46.757 --> 32:48.877
we should probably pack up
and start tracking it, huh?

32:48.901 --> 32:49.978
- Oh no.

32:50.002 --> 32:53.016
We won't get any coordinates
until it starts its descent.

32:53.040 --> 32:55.466
Probably won't even
get a video signal.

32:55.490 --> 32:57.020
Need to check the satellite

32:57.044 --> 32:59.091
since they're so far
out in outer space.

32:59.115 --> 33:00.955
I need a boost from
another source.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.508
Which is impossible.

33:02.532 --> 33:04.544
- What about your sat dish?

33:04.568 --> 33:05.718
- Short range.

33:05.742 --> 33:07.892
Not even close to
powerful enough.

33:07.916 --> 33:09.446
- Why is it even here?

33:09.470 --> 33:11.966
- Scientist must have his toys.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.270
- So you mean you're full of it.

33:14.406 --> 33:16.132
- You could say that.

33:20.757 --> 33:22.069
- So how is Dad?

33:24.519 --> 33:26.877
- He's okay, I guess.

33:26.901 --> 33:28.706
Works long hours,

33:28.730 --> 33:30.053
comes home late.

33:30.077 --> 33:32.117
I think he still really
missed you around the house.

33:32.141 --> 33:34.316
I just don't feel at home.

33:37.015 --> 33:39.614
- Well, dad and I were
always really close.

33:39.638 --> 33:42.375
Just like you and Mom
were really close.

33:42.399 --> 33:45.171
Dad just misses the
way things used to be

33:45.195 --> 33:47.760
when we were all
together as a family.

33:47.784 --> 33:49.717
- I guess you're right.

33:52.858 --> 33:54.353
I just wish I was more like you.

33:54.377 --> 33:55.181
You know?

33:55.205 --> 33:56.448
- More like me?

33:57.311 --> 33:59.554
I wish I was more like you.

34:00.417 --> 34:03.155
You're a hell of a lot
smarter than I am, Shawn.

34:03.179 --> 34:04.708
I mean, look at
what you're doing.

34:04.732 --> 34:09.023
A kid your age thinking
about space exploration?

34:09.047 --> 34:12.233
Me, I just pissed
high school away.

34:12.257 --> 34:15.098
Having fun, going to parties.

34:15.121 --> 34:17.721
Kinda like I'm doing now.

34:19.126 --> 34:22.036
- Yeah but you always
had the buddies

34:22.060 --> 34:24.452
and even girlfriends.

34:24.476 --> 34:29.481
Man, I'm known as Michael
Neary's little nerd brother.

34:29.688 --> 34:32.701
I feel like a complete
outcast sometimes.

34:32.725 --> 34:34.382
- Shawn, look at me.

34:35.487 --> 34:37.810
You are not an outcast.

34:37.833 --> 34:39.467
Okay?

34:39.491 --> 34:42.539
People are just afraid of
what they don't understand.

34:42.563 --> 34:45.404
You're on a completely
different level

34:45.428 --> 34:47.578
and it won't take long for
them to figure that out.

34:47.601 --> 34:48.821
I promise.

34:48.844 --> 34:50.373
- How would you know?

34:50.398 --> 34:51.789
Man, you were the popular one.

34:51.813 --> 34:54.929
And any brother would say that.

34:54.954 --> 34:58.072
- You remember what
Mom used to say?

34:58.096 --> 35:02.076
Everybody has something about
them that makes them special.

35:02.100 --> 35:05.907
The trick is you have to
figure out what it is.

35:05.931 --> 35:07.391
Shawn,

35:07.415 --> 35:09.290
you have figured it out

35:09.314 --> 35:12.914
and you're the most special
person I've ever met.

35:18.461 --> 35:19.531
- I miss her.

35:23.259 --> 35:24.259
- So do I.

35:38.308 --> 35:39.803
- Hey, Martin.

35:39.827 --> 35:41.529
- Johnathon, good to see you.

35:41.553 --> 35:42.357
- Yeah, yeah.

35:42.381 --> 35:43.186
- You taking care of yourself?

35:43.210 --> 35:44.083
- Yeah, I'm good.

35:44.107 --> 35:44.911
- Yeah?

35:44.935 --> 35:45.740
The kids all right?

35:45.764 --> 35:46.568
- Kids are good, yeah.

35:46.592 --> 35:47.592
We're good.

35:48.353 --> 35:50.917
Still a bit of an
adjustment period.

35:50.941 --> 35:52.574
- That's good to hear.

35:52.598 --> 35:54.369
Well I assume you're
here to see Martha.

35:54.393 --> 35:56.164
- Yeah, I heard she's awake.

35:56.188 --> 35:58.068
I'm gonna go ask her a few
questions, all right?

35:58.092 --> 35:58.822
Good seeing you.

35:58.846 --> 36:01.046
- Hey, John, do you mind if
we speak just a minute more?

36:01.070 --> 36:01.790
- Of course.

36:01.814 --> 36:02.998
Yeah, what is it?

36:03.022 --> 36:07.831
- Well, we ran some blood
tests on Martha and found...

36:07.855 --> 36:09.212
- What?

36:09.236 --> 36:12.491
- She has acute
radiation syndrome.

36:12.515 --> 36:13.768
- How is that possible?

36:13.792 --> 36:14.769
- I don't know.

36:14.793 --> 36:16.874
But see, she has
high blood pressure.

36:16.898 --> 36:19.049
So every month we do
blood panels on her.

36:19.073 --> 36:21.189
So I went back to the
chart three weeks ago

36:21.213 --> 36:22.121
and there was nothing.

36:22.145 --> 36:23.265
There were no abnormalities.

36:23.289 --> 36:25.573
Her blood cell count was normal.

36:25.597 --> 36:27.747
But now it's
dropping like her IV

36:27.771 --> 36:31.234
is hooked up to a
nuclear reactor.

36:31.258 --> 36:32.062
- That's weird.

36:32.086 --> 36:34.478
I mean, besides exhaustion,

36:34.502 --> 36:36.929
she seemed to want peace.

36:36.953 --> 36:40.381
- Well, I'll tell you what I
find even more troubling.

36:40.405 --> 36:42.037
She doesn't present
the normal symptoms

36:42.061 --> 36:45.272
of nausea or vomiting
or abnormal pain.

36:46.342 --> 36:47.664
But with numbers like these,

36:47.688 --> 36:50.253
my god, she may not
last the night.

36:59.941 --> 37:02.506
- Jane, thank you for coming
on such short notice.

37:02.530 --> 37:03.507
I really appreciate it.

37:03.531 --> 37:04.819
- No problem at
all, you know me.

37:04.843 --> 37:06.234
Plus, it takes me
out of the house

37:06.258 --> 37:08.098
and away from grading papers.

37:08.122 --> 37:08.926
- Good.

37:08.950 --> 37:09.858
How's she doing?

37:09.882 --> 37:12.930
- She's been in and
out of it all day.

37:12.954 --> 37:15.105
They have her pretty
heavily sedated.

37:15.129 --> 37:16.589
Apparently when she came to,

37:16.613 --> 37:18.522
she thought she was
still on the farm

37:18.546 --> 37:20.593
and she was screaming
at the top of her lungs

37:20.617 --> 37:22.802
about the tall man.

37:22.826 --> 37:24.425
- Tall man, I've
heard this before.

37:24.449 --> 37:26.323
- I did have her
describe him to me

37:26.347 --> 37:27.704
and I do have a sketch for you.

37:27.728 --> 37:28.728
- Great.

37:34.700 --> 37:36.644
What is this, Jane?

37:36.668 --> 37:40.672
- John, that's exactly
what she described to me.

37:50.337 --> 37:51.337
- Martha?

37:52.546 --> 37:55.110
Martha, can you hear me?

37:55.134 --> 37:56.134
Martha?

37:57.136 --> 37:58.136
Martha?

37:58.966 --> 38:00.323
Martha?

38:00.347 --> 38:01.841
- Grandma.

38:01.865 --> 38:04.499
- Martha, I need you to tell
me what happened this morning.

38:04.523 --> 38:05.523
Okay?

38:06.525 --> 38:10.115
I need you to tell me
what happened to Ted.

38:12.324 --> 38:13.636
- It's my fault.

38:14.844 --> 38:17.778
- What's your fault, Martha?

38:21.402 --> 38:22.852
- I prayed to God

38:24.371 --> 38:26.521
and he made it happen.

38:26.545 --> 38:27.545
They...

38:29.514 --> 38:32.044
They took my poor husband.

38:32.068 --> 38:34.357
- Who's they, Martha?

38:34.381 --> 38:35.461
Who took Ted?

38:37.798 --> 38:39.120
- Devils.

38:39.144 --> 38:42.019
There are devils
everywhere, John.

38:44.494 --> 38:47.014
We were not pure in our souls.

38:50.086 --> 38:52.271
We were not kind to each other.

38:52.295 --> 38:53.203
We...

38:53.227 --> 38:54.227
We...

38:55.678 --> 38:58.208
That's why they've come.

38:58.232 --> 39:00.786
They've come to take all of us.

39:01.695 --> 39:02.695
Yes.

39:02.719 --> 39:04.835
And it is my fault.

39:04.859 --> 39:06.320
It's all my fault.

39:06.344 --> 39:07.828
It's all my fault.

39:08.863 --> 39:10.348
It's all my fault.

39:11.245 --> 39:12.660
Oh, I'm so sorry.

39:13.730 --> 39:16.077
They've come to take us all.

39:26.571 --> 39:31.369
- So where did you come up with
the idea for this anyways?

39:32.439 --> 39:34.831
- Well, it was at
Emily's birthday party.

39:35.959 --> 39:38.317
She had all her friend's over.

39:41.275 --> 39:43.633
They were all having
such a great time.

39:49.663 --> 39:51.710
And there she was.

40:12.410 --> 40:14.526
- You shoulda pushed
that kid out of the way

40:14.550 --> 40:15.906
and talked to her.

40:15.930 --> 40:16.804
- The girl?

40:16.828 --> 40:17.977
- Yeah.

40:18.001 --> 40:19.185
- No.

40:19.209 --> 40:20.369
Even if I had the courage to,

40:20.393 --> 40:22.119
I would've totally
missed the sign.

40:22.143 --> 40:22.948
- The sign?

40:22.972 --> 40:23.776
What sign?

40:23.800 --> 40:24.974
- The balloon.

40:25.837 --> 40:27.711
Had I spent my time
talking to that girl,

40:27.735 --> 40:30.921
it would've meant the balloon
going up without me seeing it.

40:30.945 --> 40:33.027
It was all part of her plan.

40:33.051 --> 40:36.779
- Well, I guess that's
one way to look at it.

40:38.884 --> 40:40.586
Well, I hope we're done by five.

40:40.610 --> 40:43.175
I gotta kick it with
Bill and Tim tonight.

40:43.199 --> 40:44.372
Got big plans.

40:45.615 --> 40:48.446
- We're not gonna
be back by five.

40:49.930 --> 40:52.356
- What're you talking
about, dude?

40:52.380 --> 40:54.807
Shawn, they're throwing
me a welcome home party.

40:54.831 --> 40:56.637
I mean, I gotta be there.

40:56.661 --> 40:59.433
- This thing's going 20 miles
into the upper atmosphere.

40:59.457 --> 41:01.257
Once it pops, depending
on the wind direction,

41:01.281 --> 41:04.679
it could land anywhere within
a 30 to 60 mile radius.

41:04.703 --> 41:06.509
There's no telling where
this thing could land

41:06.533 --> 41:07.893
and it's imperative
that we find it

41:07.917 --> 41:09.443
or else this is all for nothing.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.306
- Well that's just great, bro.

41:11.330 --> 41:13.585
I thought this was only going
to last a couple of hours.

41:13.609 --> 41:15.483
- What gave you that idea?

41:15.507 --> 41:18.624
Man, okay, granted, I told
Shannon I'd be home by dinner,

41:18.648 --> 41:21.351
but that's not till 8:30.

41:21.375 --> 41:23.735
- I don't know, Shawn, I thought
we were gonna come out here

41:23.759 --> 41:26.114
and I'd fly this thing
on a kite or something.

41:26.138 --> 41:27.288
I didn't think we were gonna

41:27.312 --> 41:30.153
be exploring deep-frickin-space.

41:30.177 --> 41:31.350
- Sorry, dude.

41:45.088 --> 41:47.366
- Is that dude watching us?

41:50.680 --> 41:52.244
- Are you sure he's watching us?

41:52.268 --> 41:55.167
- Yeah, he was
totally watching us.

41:57.411 --> 41:58.975
- Maybe it's just a park ranger

41:58.999 --> 42:01.564
checking on what we're going.

42:01.588 --> 42:03.220
- No.

42:03.244 --> 42:06.879
Didn't look like any park
ranger I've ever seen.

42:06.903 --> 42:08.191
Kinda creepy.

42:18.536 --> 42:19.536
- Yeah?

42:20.399 --> 42:22.885
All right, hold on one second.

42:25.301 --> 42:27.659
Hey, you know, we
gave it a shot.

42:27.683 --> 42:29.523
Jane, I really wanna
thank you for coming in.

42:29.547 --> 42:31.317
- Yeah, of course, anytime.

42:31.341 --> 42:32.515
- Oh and Jane,

42:33.654 --> 42:35.736
I think we should
probably keep this

42:35.760 --> 42:38.014
between you and me for now.

42:38.038 --> 42:40.281
- Sure, John, I understand.

42:41.800 --> 42:44.020
- Steve, talk to me.

42:44.044 --> 42:45.564
- I got all the troops
gathered up here

42:45.588 --> 42:46.712
at the fruit tree orchard.

42:46.736 --> 42:49.232
We're right were the tracks
go off into oblivion, man.

42:49.256 --> 42:50.736
We're ready to rock
when you get here.

42:50.760 --> 42:52.580
- That's great. That's great.

42:52.604 --> 42:54.099
I'm here with Martha right now,

42:54.123 --> 42:56.342
but it looks like we're
hitting a dead end with her.

42:56.366 --> 42:57.846
- All right, well
Stan, Rick and Billy

42:57.870 --> 42:58.813
showed up fully loaded, man.

42:58.837 --> 43:01.037
I think things are
about to get weird.

43:01.061 --> 43:02.590
Hell, even Jurassic
Bob showed up.

43:02.614 --> 43:03.902
You need to get down here, man.

43:03.926 --> 43:05.869
- Hey, look, you keep
those guys in line

43:05.893 --> 43:08.423
and keep them calm until
I get there, all right?

43:08.447 --> 43:11.002
- All right, bro, see you soon.

43:14.626 --> 43:15.662
- Oh, family.

43:24.015 --> 43:25.061
- Neary residence,

43:25.085 --> 43:26.890
This is Emily, may I help you?

43:26.914 --> 43:28.478
- Hi, Emily, it's John.

43:28.502 --> 43:29.410
- Oh, hi John.

43:29.434 --> 43:31.481
Are you gonna go to my game?

43:31.505 --> 43:33.759
Me and mom were
just getting ready.

43:33.783 --> 43:36.555
- Sweetheart, I can't make
it to your game today.

43:36.579 --> 43:38.488
I'm stuck at work.

43:38.512 --> 43:41.008
Look, I'll totally make
it up to you, all right?

43:41.032 --> 43:43.458
Tomorrow we'll go out in the
yard, we'll play some catch

43:43.482 --> 43:45.763
and then I'll take you for some
ice cream afterwards, huh?

43:45.787 --> 43:46.910
How about that?

43:46.934 --> 43:47.773
- Okay.

43:47.797 --> 43:50.362
I'm totally up for
a little C and C.

43:50.386 --> 43:51.881
- "Catch and Cream," you got it.

43:51.905 --> 43:53.089
We're on.

43:53.113 --> 43:55.022
Is your Mom around?

43:55.046 --> 43:56.437
- She's getting ready.

43:56.461 --> 43:59.198
Do you want me to go get her?

43:59.222 --> 44:01.269
- Just tell her that I'll
call her later, all right?

44:01.293 --> 44:02.098
- Okay.

44:02.122 --> 44:03.030
See ya.

44:03.054 --> 44:04.054
- Bye, hun.

45:06.255 --> 45:07.256
- Oh my god.

45:08.188 --> 45:09.821
It's working!

45:09.845 --> 45:11.408
Michael, it's working!

45:11.432 --> 45:12.432
Michael!

45:14.712 --> 45:16.310
It's working.

45:16.334 --> 45:18.381
We're getting a signal.

45:24.687 --> 45:26.147
Oh my god, it's working!

45:26.171 --> 45:27.651
The Neary One's
streaming live footage

45:27.675 --> 45:29.332
and we're recording!

45:30.831 --> 45:31.912
But how?

45:31.936 --> 45:33.776
This thing's not even
close to powerful enough.

45:33.800 --> 45:35.536
It shouldn't start
streaming till descent.

45:35.560 --> 45:36.840
- Are we looking at outer space?

45:36.864 --> 45:39.314
- No, it's the upper atmosphere
but we're really close.

45:43.464 --> 45:44.683
We did it!

45:44.707 --> 45:45.511
We actually did it!

45:45.535 --> 45:47.617
Thank you so much!

45:47.641 --> 45:48.963
I'm gonna be famous!

45:48.987 --> 45:49.826
- Hey!

45:49.850 --> 45:51.369
We will be famous.

45:52.577 --> 45:53.830
- Man, look at that!

45:53.854 --> 45:55.373
That's our planet.

45:57.099 --> 46:00.492
Can you believe how small
we are in the universe?

46:02.829 --> 46:04.358
- Why is it bouncing
around like that?

46:04.382 --> 46:08.155
- Well, with the high
altitude, the atmosphere...

46:08.179 --> 46:09.179
What?

46:10.146 --> 46:11.952
- It stopped.

46:15.117 --> 46:17.533
What the hell is that, Shawn?

46:18.499 --> 46:20.029
Shawn?

46:25.058 --> 46:26.058
Shawn?

46:26.818 --> 46:29.797
Shawn, what the hell is that?

46:29.821 --> 46:31.109
Shawn?!

46:31.133 --> 46:32.524
- I don't know.

46:39.348 --> 46:40.349
- Holy shit!

46:42.489 --> 46:43.846
What are you doing?

46:43.870 --> 46:45.019
- Thermal.

46:45.043 --> 46:45.986
Invisibility cloak.

46:46.010 --> 46:46.849
- What?

46:46.873 --> 46:47.677
Thermal?

46:47.701 --> 46:48.678
Invisibility cloak?

46:48.702 --> 46:50.382
Shawn, what the hell
are you talking about?

46:50.406 --> 46:51.198
- I found it!

46:51.222 --> 46:52.982
I'm applying a thermal
filter to the footage.

46:53.006 --> 46:53.510
- Why?

46:53.534 --> 46:54.373
- Heat censoring.

46:54.397 --> 46:55.996
- What are you talking
about, Shawn?!

47:15.625 --> 47:18.180
- We need to find that shuttle.

47:22.736 --> 47:23.955
Oh my god, Michael!

47:23.979 --> 47:25.197
We actually did it!

47:25.221 --> 47:27.959
We made contact with
extraterrestrials!

47:27.983 --> 47:30.271
Dude, my name will be in
every scientific journal.

47:30.295 --> 47:32.791
I'll be all over television.

47:32.815 --> 47:33.965
Okay,

47:33.989 --> 47:36.760
so the Neary One's been
descending for 15 minutes now.

47:36.784 --> 47:37.969
Yeah, here it is.

47:37.993 --> 47:40.523
Looks like it's touching
down 45 miles from us.

47:40.547 --> 47:43.457
Hopefully not in a lake or else
you'll be swimming, Michael.

47:43.481 --> 47:44.872
Michael?

47:44.896 --> 47:46.391
Hey, what're you doing?

47:46.415 --> 47:47.668
Michael, we can't stop here!

47:47.692 --> 47:48.600
We need to get to the shuttle.

47:48.624 --> 47:49.936
- Aliens, Shawn!

47:51.385 --> 47:52.397
Aliens.

47:52.421 --> 47:54.606
I mean, what the hell?

47:54.630 --> 47:56.297
I just like...

47:56.321 --> 47:57.402
I mean...

47:57.426 --> 47:59.300
You know how this changes
everything, Shawn?

47:59.324 --> 48:00.981
You know how this...

48:01.948 --> 48:03.259
What this means?

48:04.191 --> 48:06.273
I mean, I don't
know what I mean.

48:06.297 --> 48:08.931
This is just a lot
for me to handle.

48:08.955 --> 48:09.966
- Michael.

48:09.990 --> 48:11.750
- I just need a minute.
I just need a minute.

48:11.774 --> 48:12.693
- It's okay.

48:12.717 --> 48:13.521
It's okay.

48:13.545 --> 48:15.385
We just need to get there.

48:15.409 --> 48:17.318
- Wouldn't the government
know about this?

48:17.342 --> 48:18.216
They have to know about this!

48:18.240 --> 48:20.218
I mean, what if they invade us?!

48:20.242 --> 48:22.876
- Michael, they've known
for a very long time.

48:22.900 --> 48:24.532
- Okay, Mr. Conspiracy Theory.

48:24.556 --> 48:29.537
- It's a bit late to call
me that, don't you think?

48:29.561 --> 48:30.561
Jeez.

48:31.955 --> 48:32.955
We gotta call somebody.

48:32.979 --> 48:34.379
We gotta call the
cops or something.

48:34.403 --> 48:35.198
- Call the cops?!

48:35.222 --> 48:36.510
Are you insane?!

48:36.534 --> 48:39.237
Michael, we can't call the cops.

48:39.261 --> 48:40.617
- Okay, calm down.

48:40.641 --> 48:41.825
- Calm down?!

48:41.849 --> 48:43.862
Do you understand
what you're saying?

48:43.886 --> 48:44.863
If we call the cops,

48:44.887 --> 48:46.487
they'll definitely
take the footage away.

48:46.511 --> 48:48.142
They might even put us away.

48:48.166 --> 48:50.582
No one can know what we have.

48:52.550 --> 48:54.286
- We should at least call Dad.

48:54.310 --> 48:56.702
- Dad is the authorities.

48:56.726 --> 48:59.188
What don't you understand?

48:59.212 --> 49:00.292
Man!

49:00.316 --> 49:01.984
We could even get
in trouble for...

49:02.008 --> 49:03.008
- What?

49:04.148 --> 49:07.910
We could even get in
trouble for what, Shawn?

49:13.536 --> 49:14.536
What?!

49:16.712 --> 49:20.209
- Remember when I said the FAA
gave us clearance to launch?

49:20.233 --> 49:21.233
- Yes, and?

49:22.960 --> 49:24.099
- They didn't.

49:25.341 --> 49:28.044
They sent me a letter of
denial earlier this week.

49:28.068 --> 49:29.356
- Oh, that's brilliant, Shawn.

49:29.380 --> 49:31.668
- Which makes total sense now.

49:31.692 --> 49:34.016
They don't want anyone
knowing about the aliens.

49:34.040 --> 49:36.400
- Come on, Shawn, they couldn't
possible have known about...

49:36.424 --> 49:37.433
- Couldn't possibly what?

49:37.457 --> 49:42.117
What's not remotely possible
after what we've just seen?

49:43.083 --> 49:44.083
Hmm?

50:03.494 --> 50:04.894
- I just wanted to
get laid tonight.

50:04.918 --> 50:05.918
- Oh god.

50:10.156 --> 50:11.156
- Let's go!

50:11.180 --> 50:12.813
Get on out there, Shandra.

50:12.837 --> 50:13.641
Danae.

50:13.665 --> 50:14.677
What's your name?

50:14.701 --> 50:16.679
It doesn't matter, hit a home run.
Let's go!

50:17.612 --> 50:18.612
- Go pirates!

50:18.636 --> 50:19.636
Let's go!

50:20.304 --> 50:21.304
- All right, come on!

50:21.328 --> 50:24.469
Let's get in there
and make a home run!

50:46.629 --> 50:47.882
- Woo hoo!

50:47.906 --> 50:49.011
Hey, Shannon.

50:49.644 --> 50:50.644
- Hi, Diane.

50:50.668 --> 50:51.921
- How you doing?

50:51.945 --> 50:52.749
- I'm good.

50:52.773 --> 50:53.785
How're you doing?

50:53.809 --> 50:54.993
- Oh good, good.

50:55.017 --> 50:55.821
- All right, who's next?

50:55.845 --> 50:56.684
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

50:56.708 --> 50:57.547
Get in there!

50:57.571 --> 50:58.997
- Let's go, Pirates!

50:59.021 --> 51:00.861
Come on, win that game!

51:00.885 --> 51:01.885
Go! Go! Go!

51:04.613 --> 51:06.798
- So things are good between
you and John, I assume.

51:06.822 --> 51:07.833
Right?

51:07.857 --> 51:09.594
- Yeah, of course.

51:09.618 --> 51:10.974
Yeah, thanks for
being concerned.

51:10.998 --> 51:12.183
- Good.

51:12.207 --> 51:14.323
I'm so glad that he's doing
so well after everything.

51:14.347 --> 51:17.360
I mean, Laurie, she as just a
really good friend of ours.

51:17.384 --> 51:19.121
He's been lucky.

51:19.145 --> 51:21.364
He's got you here to
get him through it.

51:21.388 --> 51:22.365
- Right.

51:22.389 --> 51:23.909
Well thank you for
your concern, Diane.

51:23.933 --> 51:25.161
I really appreciate that.

51:25.185 --> 51:28.164
- That's what I'm here for.

51:28.188 --> 51:29.786
- Go Pirates!

51:29.810 --> 51:30.925
Let's go!

51:30.949 --> 51:31.949
Woo hoo!

51:33.711 --> 51:37.104
- Some of the other mothers
and I, we were talking.

51:37.128 --> 51:39.658
You know, about what
happened this morning.

51:39.682 --> 51:42.144
At poor Ted and Martha's.

51:42.168 --> 51:44.663
Do you know how
Martha's holding up?

51:44.687 --> 51:45.906
- No.

51:45.930 --> 51:47.610
I mean, Johnny doesn't
bring anything home.

51:47.634 --> 51:49.461
He just doesn't want
to upset me, you know?

51:49.485 --> 51:51.325
So this is probably one
of those local disputes

51:51.349 --> 51:53.247
or something, I'm sure.

51:54.145 --> 51:55.191
- Go! That's right!

51:55.215 --> 51:56.468
Run that base!

51:56.492 --> 51:57.573
Go!

52:01.118 --> 52:02.440
- Shannon, you don't
know what happened?

52:02.464 --> 52:03.864
You really don't
know what happened?

52:03.888 --> 52:05.132
- Is it their infamous fight?

52:05.156 --> 52:05.960
What?

52:05.984 --> 52:06.789
What could it be?

52:06.813 --> 52:07.813
- No.

52:08.539 --> 52:11.069
Supposedly this group of men

52:11.093 --> 52:12.381
kidnapped Ted.

52:12.405 --> 52:14.762
They were tall and Martha
tried to fight them off

52:14.786 --> 52:16.454
but they left her for dead
on the side of the road.

52:16.478 --> 52:17.282
- Are you kidding me?

52:17.306 --> 52:18.180
- No.

52:18.204 --> 52:19.860
That's what I heard.

52:21.011 --> 52:22.011
- Let's go!

52:22.035 --> 52:23.357
Come on!

52:23.381 --> 52:24.703
Let's go, Emily!

52:24.727 --> 52:26.188
- There's Emily.

52:26.212 --> 52:27.568
She looks so cute
in the uniform.

52:27.592 --> 52:28.592
Emily!

52:36.992 --> 52:37.992
- Emily.

52:38.016 --> 52:39.546
Emily.

52:39.570 --> 52:42.997
Listen, I need you to keep
your eye on the ball, okay?

52:43.021 --> 52:44.378
Follow it all the way in.

52:44.402 --> 52:45.690
Remember what we talked about?

52:45.714 --> 52:47.347
You're gonna, it's gonna.

52:47.371 --> 52:48.520
Okay, you got this.

52:48.544 --> 52:49.349
Great, okay.

52:49.373 --> 52:50.281
I'll be...

52:50.305 --> 52:51.109
Just...

52:51.133 --> 52:51.937
Okay.

52:51.961 --> 52:52.766
All right, okay.

52:52.790 --> 52:54.354
Okay, here we go.

52:54.378 --> 52:55.378
- Emily!

53:13.270 --> 53:14.270
- Woo! Woo!

53:14.294 --> 53:15.375
I did it! I did it!

53:15.399 --> 53:17.031
Woo! Woo! Woo!

53:17.055 --> 53:18.101
Woo!

53:54.058 --> 53:55.380
- Emily?

54:24.295 --> 54:25.410
Are you okay?

54:25.434 --> 54:26.860
- Mhmm.

54:26.884 --> 54:28.164
- See if we can call John again.

54:43.349 --> 54:45.603
- Come on, Shannon, pick up.

54:45.627 --> 54:47.329
- I don't know why I
can't get through.

54:47.353 --> 54:49.976
I'll try to call one more time.

54:54.843 --> 54:56.579
- For Christ sakes.

55:15.381 --> 55:16.461
- John is here now.

55:16.485 --> 55:18.946
He's going to explain the
plan to everybody, okay?

55:20.040 --> 55:21.432
- I see you got this.

55:21.456 --> 55:22.364
- Do something.

55:22.388 --> 55:23.192
- All right.

55:23.216 --> 55:24.020
All right, hey.

55:24.044 --> 55:25.056
Let's all settle down.

55:25.080 --> 55:26.229
Let's quiet down.

55:26.253 --> 55:28.439
Just settle down, all right?

55:28.463 --> 55:29.405
- Everybody!

55:29.429 --> 55:31.649
Everybody, shut up!

55:31.673 --> 55:32.615
- Thank you, Bob.

55:32.639 --> 55:33.892
- Yeah, whatever.

55:33.916 --> 55:34.928
- All right, look.

55:34.952 --> 55:37.448
I wanna thank everybody
for coming out today.

55:37.472 --> 55:38.966
I know it's hot out here

55:38.990 --> 55:40.870
but I know I can speak for
everybody when we say

55:40.894 --> 55:42.522
we're all thinking about Martha,

55:42.546 --> 55:44.489
hoping her a speedy
recovery, all right?

55:44.513 --> 55:47.837
- We can also say we
come bearing great gifts

55:47.861 --> 55:50.599
for the men who
kidnapped my Uncle Ted.

55:50.623 --> 55:52.152
- This is not a manhunt.

55:52.176 --> 55:53.843
It's a search and rescue, guys.

55:53.867 --> 55:56.121
There's been no signs of
any suspicious activity.

55:56.145 --> 55:57.882
- How could you say
that, Sheriff?

55:57.906 --> 55:59.953
We've all seen the
government moving in here

55:59.977 --> 56:01.230
with their military vehicles

56:01.254 --> 56:04.060
and Ted going missing
adds fuel to the fire.

56:04.084 --> 56:04.889
- Yeah!

56:04.913 --> 56:06.097
Ever since they moved in,

56:06.121 --> 56:07.581
there's been nothing
but unexplained,

56:07.605 --> 56:08.582
weird things going on.

56:08.606 --> 56:10.066
I mean, look at our livestock.

56:10.090 --> 56:13.415
Our cows are dropping dead
like flies, right and left.

56:13.439 --> 56:14.719
- They have stomachs ripped open

56:14.743 --> 56:17.729
like some kind of voodoo
experiment gone wrong.

56:17.753 --> 56:19.110
- Something sure
spooked my cows.

56:19.134 --> 56:21.423
They won't even step out
into the pasture to graze.

56:21.447 --> 56:22.424
- Have to admit, Sheriff.

56:22.448 --> 56:23.597
It can't all be coincidence,

56:23.621 --> 56:25.841
this weird stuff happening
when they move into town.

56:25.865 --> 56:27.567
- First they take out livestock,

56:27.591 --> 56:29.085
then they're gonna
come take our lands

56:29.109 --> 56:30.155
and next thing you know,

56:30.179 --> 56:31.812
they're gonna want our guns

56:31.836 --> 56:32.986
and we will fight!

56:36.151 --> 56:37.911
- This is about to go sideways.
Do something.

56:37.935 --> 56:39.682
- Yeah, I know.

56:39.706 --> 56:40.856
- Hey, look,

56:40.880 --> 56:42.858
nobody's gonna take
your life stock.

56:42.882 --> 56:44.135
Nobody's gonna take your land.

56:44.159 --> 56:45.757
- But how do you know, Sheriff?

56:45.781 --> 56:47.034
Do you have any answers at all

56:47.058 --> 56:49.761
to what's going on around here?

56:49.785 --> 56:51.107
- No, all right.

56:51.131 --> 56:54.283
At this point in time, I don't
have all the facts, guys.

56:54.307 --> 56:55.940
But I do know that
Ted's out there

56:55.964 --> 56:57.700
and he's probably hurt
and needs our help.

56:57.724 --> 57:00.531
The longer we stay here,
fighting amongst ourselves,

57:00.555 --> 57:02.774
the longer he's out
there needing us.

57:02.798 --> 57:03.603
Okay?

57:03.627 --> 57:04.466
- You're right, Sheriff.

57:04.490 --> 57:05.501
We're with you.

57:05.525 --> 57:06.813
Right everyone?

57:06.837 --> 57:09.643
- Yeah, old Ted was
my chief in the Navy.

57:09.667 --> 57:10.748
As brave as they come

57:10.772 --> 57:12.508
and we never leave
one of ours behind.

57:12.532 --> 57:14.130
So we're with you, Sheriff.

57:14.154 --> 57:16.063
- Oh please, let me know
what's happening here!

57:16.087 --> 57:17.306
Come on!

57:17.330 --> 57:19.101
- This isn't a manhunt.

57:19.125 --> 57:21.379
I'm asking you all,

57:21.403 --> 57:22.553
hand over your weapons.

57:22.577 --> 57:24.175
- Oh, no, no, no.

57:24.199 --> 57:25.556
No way.

57:25.580 --> 57:26.557
- It's a precaution.

57:26.581 --> 57:27.834
I don't want anybody
getting hurt out there.

57:27.858 --> 57:28.800
- See, it's starting now!

57:28.824 --> 57:30.008
This is marshal law.

57:30.032 --> 57:32.112
- Rick, hey, I don't want
any trouble from you today,

57:32.136 --> 57:33.011
all right?

57:33.035 --> 57:34.835
We're all heading out in
these fields together

57:34.859 --> 57:35.801
and the last thing we need

57:35.825 --> 57:38.292
is somebody to get
shot on accident.

57:38.316 --> 57:42.469
Steve, here, is gonna
collect your guns.

57:42.493 --> 57:43.493
- Thanks.

57:45.600 --> 57:47.280
- Hey, everyone's gonna
get their guns back

57:47.304 --> 57:48.371
at the end of the day.

57:48.395 --> 57:50.536
It's a promise, all right?

57:51.537 --> 57:53.262
- My cold dead hands.

57:54.436 --> 57:56.093
- Seriously?

57:56.990 --> 57:57.990
- Rick.

58:17.045 --> 58:20.852
- Now I want us all heading out
into these fields behind me.

58:20.876 --> 58:22.544
I wanna split up
into groups of two.

58:22.568 --> 58:24.546
We can cover more ground
that way, all right?

58:24.570 --> 58:25.961
Billy?

58:25.985 --> 58:26.962
- Yes, Sheriff?

58:26.986 --> 58:28.666
- Hey, I want you to
hightail it out front.

58:28.690 --> 58:30.172
All right, take the lead.

58:30.196 --> 58:31.476
Steve and I will be in the back.

58:31.500 --> 58:34.003
You whistle out if you
hear anything, understood?

58:34.027 --> 58:36.927
- I'd be honored
too, sir, will do.

58:40.102 --> 58:41.725
- Grab the revolver.

58:54.151 --> 58:56.957
- Thought you weren't
expecting any trouble.

58:56.981 --> 58:59.166
- Close encounters, man.

58:59.190 --> 59:01.755
- That's actually a good idea.

59:01.779 --> 59:03.861
Before we get started,
I wanted to ask.

59:03.885 --> 59:05.828
Martha, you didn't get
anything from her?

59:05.852 --> 59:07.623
- I ran into Dr. Martin.

59:07.647 --> 59:10.902
He said she's suffering
from radiation poisoning.

59:10.926 --> 59:11.926
High doses.

59:13.584 --> 59:16.598
She's not gonna make
it through the night.

59:16.622 --> 59:17.737
- Radiation?

59:17.761 --> 59:18.876
- Yeah and get this.

59:18.900 --> 59:20.947
Jane, her sketch,

59:23.249 --> 59:25.089
it looks like a...

59:25.113 --> 59:26.746
- Like what?

59:26.770 --> 59:27.770
- A demon.

59:28.403 --> 59:29.403
- The tall man?

59:29.427 --> 59:30.907
- Look, it coulda
been the medication.

59:30.931 --> 59:33.381
She was doped up pretty good.

59:35.330 --> 59:37.170
- You heard from the boys?

59:37.194 --> 59:38.194
- No, why?

59:39.714 --> 59:40.954
- I didn't want to bring it up.

59:40.978 --> 59:42.347
- Jeez, you got
my attention now.

59:42.371 --> 59:43.371
What is it?

59:44.511 --> 59:46.144
- There's this
book I gave Shawn.

59:46.168 --> 59:47.629
Sort of an old fireman's manual

59:47.653 --> 59:50.355
on how to deal with
emergency situations.

59:50.379 --> 59:53.289
There's a chapter in there
that deals with aliens

59:53.313 --> 59:55.568
and how to combat an attack
if they ever invaded.

59:56.834 --> 59:58.114
- You're yanking
my chain, right?

59:58.138 --> 59:58.847
Come on, Steve.

59:58.871 --> 01:00:00.055
- Listen, stick with me.

01:00:00.079 --> 01:00:02.575
None of us too it seriously
in rookie training, okay?

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:04.473
We passed it off as some B.S.
from the '50s,

01:00:04.497 --> 01:00:06.337
but think about it.

01:00:06.361 --> 01:00:07.303
Ted missing.

01:00:07.327 --> 01:00:08.235
Martha sick.

01:00:08.259 --> 01:00:09.927
The cows. The Military
coming into town.

01:00:09.951 --> 01:00:11.951
You don't think something
really weird is going on?

01:00:11.975 --> 01:00:14.069
- You believe that Ted was...

01:00:14.093 --> 01:00:15.093
Abducted?

01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:17.279
Aliens?

01:00:17.303 --> 01:00:18.314
Space ships overhead?

01:00:18.338 --> 01:00:20.834
I mean, what're you
talking about?

01:00:20.858 --> 01:00:21.870
- It's stupid.

01:00:21.894 --> 01:00:23.526
You're right.

01:00:23.550 --> 01:00:24.493
- Right?

01:00:24.517 --> 01:00:25.390
Am I right?

01:00:25.414 --> 01:00:26.322
- Yeah.

01:00:26.346 --> 01:00:27.346
Let's go.

01:00:28.210 --> 01:00:30.741
- You are something else, man.

01:01:20.021 --> 01:01:21.861
- How much further is it, Shawn?

01:01:21.885 --> 01:01:23.103
- Not too far, now.

01:01:23.127 --> 01:01:25.727
Eventually you'll have to
pull over to Jenjuin's Trail.

01:01:25.751 --> 01:01:27.970
Looks like it finally
landed five miles from us

01:01:27.994 --> 01:01:30.455
in the Paiute Indian park range.

01:01:30.479 --> 01:01:31.698
- Jenjuins.

01:01:31.722 --> 01:01:32.837
That's a weird name.

01:01:32.861 --> 01:01:34.321
- Highly appropriate.

01:01:34.345 --> 01:01:37.221
Paiute Indians were known for
creating stories of Jenjuins,

01:01:37.245 --> 01:01:38.636
or flying canoes.

01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:41.708
Golden strangers coming
down from the skies.

01:01:41.732 --> 01:01:43.285
- Fly canoes, yeah.

01:01:46.288 --> 01:01:48.094
Let's just hope they
have good intentions.

01:01:48.118 --> 01:01:49.785
- At least we know they exist.

01:01:49.809 --> 01:01:52.236
Man, this is like finding
the missing link.

01:01:52.260 --> 01:01:55.480
- Yeah, except for Sasquatch
won't zap you with his ray gun.

01:01:55.504 --> 01:01:57.897
Put your head in a
jar for examination.

01:01:57.921 --> 01:01:58.760
- Here it is!

01:01:58.784 --> 01:02:01.165
Pull over here by this trail.

01:02:02.028 --> 01:02:03.720
It's gonna be great.

01:02:40.687 --> 01:02:43.666
- You ready for this, Shawn?

01:02:43.690 --> 01:02:44.690
- Yep.

01:02:45.451 --> 01:02:46.452
Let's do it.

01:03:05.782 --> 01:03:08.484
- You sure you're reading
that thing right, bro?

01:03:08.508 --> 01:03:10.141
- Yeah, we're going
the right direction.

01:03:10.165 --> 01:03:11.487
Shouldn't be too far now.

01:03:11.511 --> 01:03:12.512
Half a mile.

01:03:15.343 --> 01:03:18.598
- You think anybody
else knows about them?

01:03:18.622 --> 01:03:19.702
- Of course, man.

01:03:19.726 --> 01:03:22.360
Alien sightings have been
reported for centuries

01:03:22.384 --> 01:03:23.741
starting with the Mayans.

01:03:23.765 --> 01:03:25.053
You go to their
temples in Mexico

01:03:25.077 --> 01:03:28.332
and you can see the evidence
carved all across their walls.

01:03:28.356 --> 01:03:31.162
Too bad that the government
takes away all the evidence.

01:03:31.186 --> 01:03:34.648
They've been putting down
conspiracy theorists for years.

01:03:34.672 --> 01:03:36.478
Most people think it's
a joke simply because

01:03:36.502 --> 01:03:39.584
it's how the government
wants it to me perceived.

01:03:39.608 --> 01:03:41.863
- You're something else,
Shawn, you know that?

01:03:41.887 --> 01:03:44.199
- Dad says that to me a lot.

01:03:45.476 --> 01:03:47.006
- Why do you think they're here?

01:03:47.030 --> 01:03:48.801
- Probably to study us.

01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:49.629
- They traveled all this way

01:03:49.653 --> 01:03:51.113
just to probe our butts?

01:03:51.137 --> 01:03:53.115
Yeah, I doubt that, Shawn.

01:03:53.139 --> 01:03:55.152
- Travel for them isn't
like travel for us.

01:03:55.176 --> 01:03:57.499
They travel by
interdimensional means.

01:03:57.523 --> 01:03:58.741
Interstellar travel.

01:03:58.765 --> 01:04:02.021
They travel from universe to
universe through wormholes,

01:04:02.045 --> 01:04:03.563
until now, anyway.

01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:07.060
- What got you into
all this stuff?

01:04:07.084 --> 01:04:08.199
- What?

01:04:08.223 --> 01:04:10.995
- You know, Aliens,
conspiracy theories.

01:04:11.019 --> 01:04:14.550
I've never met anybody so
passionate about this stuff.

01:04:14.574 --> 01:04:17.484
- I think I've always been
fascinated by the truth.

01:04:17.508 --> 01:04:19.590
And I think mom taught me
that there's more to life

01:04:19.614 --> 01:04:21.730
than we see everyday.

01:04:52.198 --> 01:04:55.660
- When this gets out,
everything's gonna change.

01:04:55.684 --> 01:04:57.421
Society, religion.

01:04:57.445 --> 01:04:59.319
- I don't think so.

01:04:59.343 --> 01:05:00.631
I think that history
has shown us

01:05:00.655 --> 01:05:01.895
that in times of great peril...

01:05:02.588 --> 01:05:03.599
- Oh shit!

01:05:03.623 --> 01:05:04.946
- What are you doing?

01:05:04.970 --> 01:05:05.970
What's wrong?

01:05:07.777 --> 01:05:08.777
- The trees.

01:05:08.801 --> 01:05:10.054
- Oh my god.

01:05:10.078 --> 01:05:12.988
Michael, there's nothing there.

01:05:13.012 --> 01:05:14.300
Dude, there's nothing there.

01:05:14.324 --> 01:05:16.198
It's probably a
raccoon or something.

01:05:16.222 --> 01:05:18.614
Jeez, so much for bonding.

01:05:18.638 --> 01:05:20.099
- I just got startled
is all, Shawn.

01:05:21.365 --> 01:05:23.999
- That's ammunition
for later, my friend.

01:05:24.023 --> 01:05:25.794
- Oh, you want ammunition?

01:05:25.818 --> 01:05:28.099
How about I leave you in the
wood with your alien friends?

01:05:28.123 --> 01:05:29.211
- Oh no, dude, come on.

01:05:29.235 --> 01:05:30.143
- So tough.

01:05:30.167 --> 01:05:31.386
- Oh, come on man.

01:05:31.410 --> 01:05:34.907
- Last one up the hill
gets their butt probed.

01:05:57.643 --> 01:05:58.643
Whoa.

01:06:31.297 --> 01:06:32.297
Ugh.

01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:36.175
Hey.

01:06:36.199 --> 01:06:37.590
Maybe we shouldn't.

01:06:37.614 --> 01:06:39.719
- Cow mutilation.

01:06:41.721 --> 01:06:43.837
- You think that

01:06:43.861 --> 01:06:45.141
they had something
to do with it?

01:06:45.165 --> 01:06:46.668
- What else would?

01:06:46.692 --> 01:06:47.703
- I don't know.

01:06:47.727 --> 01:06:48.532
Leatherface.

01:06:48.556 --> 01:06:49.626
- Be serious.

01:06:51.904 --> 01:06:55.435
I did hear a theory about cows
being used an incubators.

01:06:55.459 --> 01:06:58.576
Maybe most of these are female.

01:06:58.600 --> 01:06:59.774
- Baby aliens.

01:07:01.051 --> 01:07:02.339
Fantastic.

01:07:02.363 --> 01:07:05.780
- We need to document
this for posterity.

01:07:09.335 --> 01:07:10.795
- Jesus.

01:07:10.819 --> 01:07:12.131
So many of them.

01:07:14.237 --> 01:07:16.663
I'm never eating a
hamburger again.

01:07:32.197 --> 01:07:33.357
- Look, Micheal, there it is!

01:07:33.381 --> 01:07:34.509
We found it!

01:07:34.533 --> 01:07:35.533
- Great.

01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:37.753
Great, bro.

01:07:37.777 --> 01:07:41.033
I didn't think I'd be
climbing trees today.

01:08:00.352 --> 01:08:02.078
- Hop to it, old man.

01:08:03.907 --> 01:08:05.460
- God, I spoil you.

01:08:12.916 --> 01:08:15.101
- Come on, we need to
get to that shuttle.

01:08:15.125 --> 01:08:17.654
- Hey, I gotta protect the bod.

01:08:17.679 --> 01:08:19.439
Keep your panties on.

01:08:21.959 --> 01:08:23.661
- Go!

01:08:23.685 --> 01:08:26.412
- You're about to
do it yourself.

01:08:40.529 --> 01:08:44.533
- Come on, Michael,
you're almost there.

01:08:57.926 --> 01:08:59.283
- How's it look?

01:08:59.307 --> 01:09:00.629
- Perfect condition.

01:09:00.653 --> 01:09:03.563
We can check the footage
when we get back to the...

01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:10.456
- I wanna see that creepy
freaking alien ship again.

01:09:23.917 --> 01:09:24.917
Shawn.

01:09:26.231 --> 01:09:27.956
Shawn, what do we do?

01:09:33.099 --> 01:09:34.099
Shawn.

01:09:36.930 --> 01:09:38.080
Shawn!

01:09:38.104 --> 01:09:39.392
Shawn!

01:09:50.531 --> 01:09:52.533
- Wake up, my sweet boy.

01:09:57.814 --> 01:09:59.516
Shawn, honey,

01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:00.713
watch the sky.

01:10:01.921 --> 01:10:03.554
- What's gonna happen, Mom?

01:10:03.578 --> 01:10:05.235
- You'll see, watch.

01:10:08.273 --> 01:10:09.767
There they are.

01:10:09.791 --> 01:10:10.791
- Oh, wow.

01:10:15.866 --> 01:10:17.499
- Isn't it beautiful?

01:10:17.523 --> 01:10:19.087
- It's amazing.

01:10:40.684 --> 01:10:42.075
- Shawn, honey?

01:10:42.099 --> 01:10:44.043
- Yeah, what is it, Mom?

01:10:44.067 --> 01:10:47.736
- I have to talk to you
about something, okay?

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:49.037
- What's wrong?

01:10:49.935 --> 01:10:50.935
- I'm...

01:10:54.526 --> 01:10:56.148
- Yeah, what is it?

01:11:00.497 --> 01:11:03.062
- I just want you to
know that I love you

01:11:03.086 --> 01:11:04.467
with all my life.

01:11:06.227 --> 01:11:11.001
And no matter what happens,
I will always be with you.

01:11:11.025 --> 01:11:12.071
- I know, Mom.

01:11:12.095 --> 01:11:13.338
I love you too.

01:11:14.615 --> 01:11:15.615
- I know.

01:11:17.031 --> 01:11:18.031
Always.

01:11:31.356 --> 01:11:32.529
Keep watching.

01:11:41.435 --> 01:11:42.850
- It's beautiful.

01:12:24.961 --> 01:12:27.135
- Oh my gosh, the shuttle!

01:12:33.521 --> 01:12:34.626
They left it.

01:12:43.393 --> 01:12:44.393
- My head.

01:12:49.537 --> 01:12:51.056
Did they probe me?

01:12:54.024 --> 01:12:55.726
I don't feel any different.

01:12:55.750 --> 01:12:57.270
- Michael, look, they
left the shuttle.

01:12:57.294 --> 01:12:58.951
They didn't take it.

01:13:05.484 --> 01:13:06.484
- Shawn.

01:13:08.591 --> 01:13:11.535
Shawn, we gotta get that
to the authorities.

01:13:11.559 --> 01:13:13.665
We gotta get that to dad.

01:13:14.838 --> 01:13:17.161
- I can't believe
what just happened.

01:13:17.185 --> 01:13:19.429
- They showed me something.

01:13:23.744 --> 01:13:25.262
What is it, buddy?

01:13:27.057 --> 01:13:28.057
- I saw...

01:13:29.681 --> 01:13:30.727
I saw...

01:13:30.751 --> 01:13:31.751
- What?

01:13:33.512 --> 01:13:34.512
- Mom.

01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:37.585
I saw her again, Michael.

01:13:38.483 --> 01:13:40.623
- I don't understand, how?

01:13:49.045 --> 01:13:51.047
- This whole experiment,

01:13:52.497 --> 01:13:55.579
I was just trying to contact mom

01:13:55.603 --> 01:13:58.617
and tell her how much
I love and miss her.

01:13:58.641 --> 01:13:59.642
- Oh, Shawn.

01:14:01.328 --> 01:14:02.448
Mom's not in a place that...

01:14:02.472 --> 01:14:03.887
- I know, I know.

01:14:06.476 --> 01:14:11.319
I just thought this would bring
me closer to her somehow.

01:14:11.343 --> 01:14:13.000
God, it was so real.

01:14:14.829 --> 01:14:18.246
I can actually smell
and touch her again.

01:14:20.904 --> 01:14:22.147
And that night,

01:14:23.631 --> 01:14:26.392
that night she
knew she was sick.

01:14:27.739 --> 01:14:30.856
That's why she brought
me to the field.

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:33.617
She wanted to tell
me but she couldn't.

01:14:33.641 --> 01:14:36.206
- I miss her too, buddy.

01:14:52.004 --> 01:14:53.004
Shawn.

01:14:54.006 --> 01:14:55.491
Shawn, look at me.

01:14:57.113 --> 01:14:59.471
They showed me something too.

01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:01.300
Something horrible.

01:15:01.324 --> 01:15:03.153
We have to get to Dad.

01:15:04.776 --> 01:15:06.018
You understand?

01:16:20.506 --> 01:16:22.346
- It's no coincidence
we found them.

01:16:22.370 --> 01:16:23.451
They lead us to that tree.

01:16:23.475 --> 01:16:25.280
They wanted to make contact.

01:16:25.304 --> 01:16:26.834
There's gotta be
some sort of message

01:16:26.858 --> 01:16:28.076
they want us to deliver.

01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:29.100
But to who?

01:16:30.447 --> 01:16:31.459
- We gotta get home.

01:16:31.483 --> 01:16:32.460
What I'm talking about

01:16:32.484 --> 01:16:36.050
is they let us have that
for a reason, Shawn.

01:16:36.074 --> 01:16:37.316
Gotta get home.

01:16:39.008 --> 01:16:42.401
Gotta get this to
Dad right away.

01:16:42.425 --> 01:16:44.748
- Okay, well for safety reasons,

01:16:44.772 --> 01:16:46.732
I don't think we should
tell anybody about this...

01:16:46.756 --> 01:16:50.409
- No, Shawn, we have to
get this to the pubic!

01:16:50.433 --> 01:16:52.331
- What'd they show you?

01:16:53.470 --> 01:16:54.851
- It wasn't good.

01:16:57.578 --> 01:17:00.833
I think we overstayed
our welcome.

01:17:04.585 --> 01:17:05.585
- Hey.

01:17:07.450 --> 01:17:09.393
Maybe we should call
it for the night.

01:17:09.417 --> 01:17:10.857
I mean, we've been
searching for ours

01:17:10.881 --> 01:17:14.019
and Ted's trail went
cold miles ago.

01:17:14.043 --> 01:17:15.641
- We're all about spent.

01:17:15.665 --> 01:17:17.470
- It's too dark out here, boss.

01:17:17.494 --> 01:17:20.301
Does our families no good if
we all get lost out here.

01:17:20.325 --> 01:17:22.510
- We're way off the reservation.

01:17:22.534 --> 01:17:24.926
I don't even know
whose land we're on.

01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:26.652
- I think it's the
government's now.

01:17:26.676 --> 01:17:27.791
- Oh yeah.

01:17:27.815 --> 01:17:29.172
Isn't this Henry's old place?

01:17:29.196 --> 01:17:30.414
- This is Henry's land.

01:17:30.438 --> 01:17:33.452
- Was until they sold it to
Uncle Sam some years ago.

01:17:33.476 --> 01:17:35.076
- I used to hear some
really weird sounds

01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:36.700
coming from this place
when we were kids.

01:17:36.724 --> 01:17:39.596
We used to play up in those
hills right up over there.

01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:41.380
- Yeah, my dad used to
tell us ghost stories,

01:17:41.404 --> 01:17:43.324
keep us up at night.

01:17:43.348 --> 01:17:44.808
Used to tell us there was

01:17:44.832 --> 01:17:46.948
an Indian burial
ground around here

01:17:46.972 --> 01:17:48.536
but we never did find it.

01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:49.537
- Are you kidding me?

01:17:49.561 --> 01:17:50.503
Indian burial ground?

01:17:50.527 --> 01:17:52.195
Can we not hang out right here?

01:17:52.219 --> 01:17:54.887
- Exactly when did
Henry sell this land?

01:17:54.911 --> 01:17:56.440
- Hey, everybody!

01:17:56.464 --> 01:17:57.821
I found something!

01:18:03.092 --> 01:18:04.725
- What is it, Billy?

01:18:04.749 --> 01:18:07.037
- I was taking a leak
under this tree, here,

01:18:07.061 --> 01:18:08.476
when I looked up.

01:18:23.388 --> 01:18:25.746
- How the hell did
it get way up there?

01:18:25.770 --> 01:18:28.980
- What in the name
of sweet baby Jesus?

01:18:30.084 --> 01:18:32.269
- I want everyone to get
home as soon as possible.

01:18:32.293 --> 01:18:33.443
Got it?

01:18:33.467 --> 01:18:35.997
Split up into groups of
two, just like before.

01:18:36.021 --> 01:18:40.474
I don't want anyone getting
lost out here, all right?

01:18:41.889 --> 01:18:44.212
- You got it, Sheriff.

01:18:48.102 --> 01:18:51.979
- Call your guys out, cut
him down from there.

01:18:52.003 --> 01:18:55.696
What in the hell are we
dealing with, Steve?

01:18:56.801 --> 01:18:58.043
- I don't know.

01:19:06.811 --> 01:19:08.443
- The cows, all right?

01:19:08.467 --> 01:19:09.721
They're using them.

01:19:09.745 --> 01:19:12.206
You're right, they're using
them to make some kind of army.

01:19:12.230 --> 01:19:13.034
- An army?

01:19:13.058 --> 01:19:14.035
What are they gonna do, attack?

01:19:14.059 --> 01:19:15.059
- Right.

01:19:16.027 --> 01:19:19.972
They let us have that shuttle
for a reason, Shawn.

01:19:19.996 --> 01:19:22.803
They're on our side but not
everyone's gonna make it.

01:19:22.827 --> 01:19:24.805
We have to get to dad.

01:19:31.663 --> 01:19:34.262
Come on, Shawn, have you
not filmed enough already?

01:19:34.286 --> 01:19:35.091
- No.

01:19:35.115 --> 01:19:35.988
We need to document everything.

01:19:36.012 --> 01:19:38.888
Society needs to
know what happened.

01:19:38.912 --> 01:19:41.960
Okay, I'm grabbing the hard
drive from the shuttle.

01:19:41.984 --> 01:19:44.376
All right, now plugging
it into the computer.

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:46.447
Let's hope for the best.

01:19:46.471 --> 01:19:47.689
Come on, come on.

01:19:47.713 --> 01:19:49.726
Okay, transferring footage.

01:19:54.237 --> 01:19:55.352
Here it is.

01:19:55.376 --> 01:19:57.769
We've got the entire flight
and footage of the UFO.

01:20:00.174 --> 01:20:01.669
Wait a minute.

01:20:01.693 --> 01:20:04.223
There's some sort of
foreign language.

01:20:04.247 --> 01:20:06.674
I can't make it out.

01:20:06.698 --> 01:20:08.262
Do you hear that?

01:20:08.286 --> 01:20:10.367
- Yeah, what is that?

01:20:13.429 --> 01:20:14.533
- It stopped.

01:20:16.190 --> 01:20:19.791
We need to figure out
what this means.

01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:20.653
- John?

01:20:20.677 --> 01:20:21.447
- Yeah?

01:20:21.471 --> 01:20:22.276
- Are you okay?

01:20:22.300 --> 01:20:23.311
- Yeah.

01:20:23.335 --> 01:20:23.933
- Why didn't you
answer your phone?

01:20:23.957 --> 01:20:24.796
- Because it died.

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:25.624
- Well the boys are not here

01:20:25.648 --> 01:20:26.625
and I don't know where they are.

01:20:26.649 --> 01:20:27.453
- Wait, hold on, the
boys aren't back yet?

01:20:27.477 --> 01:20:28.385
- They didn't answer the phone,

01:20:28.409 --> 01:20:29.386
they were supposed to
be here for dinner.

01:20:29.410 --> 01:20:30.215
- They're not back yet?

01:20:30.239 --> 01:20:31.250
- No, they're not here.

01:20:31.274 --> 01:20:32.527
That's what I'm
trying to tell you

01:20:32.551 --> 01:20:33.991
and there was this
really awful cloud

01:20:34.015 --> 01:20:34.957
out at the softball field.

01:20:34.981 --> 01:20:35.599
- What?

01:20:35.623 --> 01:20:36.877
All right, all right, hold on.

01:20:36.901 --> 01:20:38.499
Just one second, all right?

01:20:38.523 --> 01:20:39.683
First thing I want you to do,

01:20:39.707 --> 01:20:41.605
I want you to call
Robert at the office.

01:20:41.629 --> 01:20:43.642
Tell him to put out the
word on the boys, okay?

01:20:43.666 --> 01:20:44.816
I'm sure they're fine.

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.880
Michael probably just stopped
off for a bite to eat.

01:20:46.904 --> 01:20:49.786
But just call him and make sure
he puts out the word, okay?

01:20:49.810 --> 01:20:50.925
- All right.

01:20:50.949 --> 01:20:53.169
- And hey, look, we're gonna
find them, all right?

01:20:53.193 --> 01:20:54.539
Is Emily asleep?

01:21:17.596 --> 01:21:20.472
- Century Log number 14.

01:21:20.496 --> 01:21:22.715
Just received a letter
denying my request

01:21:22.739 --> 01:21:24.569
to launch the balloon.

01:21:25.466 --> 01:21:27.824
It's so disappointing.

01:21:27.848 --> 01:21:29.688
Just wanted to go by the book.

01:21:29.712 --> 01:21:33.209
Obey the FAA's rules
and regulations.

01:21:33.233 --> 01:21:35.797
However, I've decided to
continue the experiment

01:21:35.821 --> 01:21:39.698
and launch my shuttle into space
this weekend as scheduled.

01:21:39.722 --> 01:21:42.183
Just wish Dad was home.

01:21:57.636 --> 01:21:59.511
- It just died on you?

01:21:59.535 --> 01:22:01.261
- I don't understand.

01:22:02.101 --> 01:22:03.101
There's plenty of gas.

01:22:03.125 --> 01:22:05.310
It didn't just run out.

01:22:05.334 --> 01:22:06.345
- Maybe it's the battery.

01:22:06.369 --> 01:22:08.647
Should we go out and check?

01:22:10.822 --> 01:22:11.822
Shit.

01:22:16.276 --> 01:22:17.356
What's that?

01:22:20.349 --> 01:22:23.121
Michael, what's going on?

01:22:23.145 --> 01:22:26.193
Michael, what're we gonna do?

01:22:26.217 --> 01:22:27.217
- Oh my god.

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:34.615
Stay really still, Shawn.

01:22:34.639 --> 01:22:35.443
- Stay?

01:22:35.467 --> 01:22:36.813
- Just be quiet.

01:22:39.955 --> 01:22:41.691
- Michael, we can't
just stay here.

01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:43.520
- All right?

01:22:43.544 --> 01:22:44.866
Here's what we're gonna do.

01:22:44.890 --> 01:22:46.420
On the count of three,

01:22:46.444 --> 01:22:49.043
I'm gonna open the door
and we're gonna run.

01:22:49.067 --> 01:22:52.391
We're gonna run as fast as
we can, you understand?

01:22:52.415 --> 01:22:53.841
All right.

01:22:53.865 --> 01:22:54.865
One.

01:22:56.592 --> 01:22:57.638
Two.

01:22:57.662 --> 01:22:59.674
- Michael, they're
all around us.

01:23:02.046 --> 01:23:03.299
Michael!

01:23:03.323 --> 01:23:04.576
Michael!

01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:05.404
Michael!

01:23:05.428 --> 01:23:06.543
- Shawn! Shawn!

01:23:35.711 --> 01:23:36.711
- Anyway,

01:23:36.735 --> 01:23:38.455
I've decided to continue
with the experiment

01:23:38.479 --> 01:23:42.234
and launch my shuttle into space
this weekend as scheduled.

01:23:42.258 --> 01:23:44.202
It's just one balloon
in the entire sky.

01:23:44.226 --> 01:23:45.341
What could happen?

01:23:45.365 --> 01:23:46.445
Neary out.

01:23:53.131 --> 01:23:55.523
- So how big was your fish?

01:23:55.547 --> 01:23:56.593
- Bigger than yours.

01:23:56.617 --> 01:23:58.526
- Yeah, mine was pretty big.

01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:59.976
- Yeah but mine was bigger.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:01.357
- Hey, mine was pretty big.

01:24:01.381 --> 01:24:02.185
- What do you mean?

01:24:02.209 --> 01:24:03.449
You didn't even catch any fish.

01:24:03.473 --> 01:24:04.153
- Yeah I did.

01:24:04.177 --> 01:24:05.592
- No, you didn't.

01:24:06.489 --> 01:24:08.595
- Why is there all these?

01:24:10.873 --> 01:24:13.748
- Look at all this broken glass.

01:24:13.772 --> 01:24:15.084
Hey, over there.

01:24:21.263 --> 01:24:23.862
- How did this thing
end up out here?

01:24:23.886 --> 01:24:25.657
- Look, the red light's on.

01:24:25.681 --> 01:24:27.590
- Does that mean it's
still recording.

01:24:27.614 --> 01:24:28.418
- I think so.

01:24:28.442 --> 01:24:29.281
- Looks like it.

01:24:29.305 --> 01:24:30.545
- Should we contact the police?

01:24:30.569 --> 01:24:32.802
Someone might have lost this.

01:24:32.826 --> 01:24:33.699
- Well,

01:24:33.723 --> 01:24:35.736
we should watch it first.

01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:36.909
- Hit the stop button.

01:24:36.933 --> 01:24:37.933
- Okay.

01:24:38.305 --> 01:24:44.703
