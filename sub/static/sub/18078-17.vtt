WEBVTT

00:02.258 --> 00:03.904
You're that Insane Wayne guy,
right?

00:03.969 --> 00:05.350
Well, just who the hell are you?

00:05.390 --> 00:06.615
<i>Pica Bob.</i>

00:06.651 --> 00:07.950
The A-Team?

00:08.606 --> 00:10.160
I'm sure not gonna believe that.

00:10.188 --> 00:13.035
Lots of mercenaries got crazy names
so they can't be identified.

00:13.080 --> 00:16.125
- Where's the assault vehicle?
- You're looking at him.

00:17.859 --> 00:20.295
Something about your offer
attracted us.

00:20.329 --> 00:22.172
You know he's gonna
double-cross us.

00:22.320 --> 00:24.800
The A-Team? Now that is hot!

00:24.857 --> 00:26.260
I want you to kill him.

00:26.665 --> 00:30.430
Well, I guess that's the end of the
friendly part of these negotiations.

00:31.932 --> 00:34.309
<i>In 1972,
a crack commando unit...</i>

00:34.393 --> 00:36.103
<i>was sent to prison
by a military court...</i>

00:36.186 --> 00:37.646
<i>for a crime they didn't commit.</i>

00:37.729 --> 00:38.897
<i>These men promptly escaped...</i>

00:38.981 --> 00:40.566
<i>from a maximum-security
stockade...</i>

00:40.649 --> 00:42.234
<i>to the Los Angeles underground.</i>

00:42.317 --> 00:43.986
<i>Today, still wanted by
the government...</i>

00:44.069 --> 00:45.904
<i>they survive
as soldiers of fortune.</i>

00:45.988 --> 00:48.490
<i>If you have a problem,
if no one else can help...</i>

00:48.574 --> 00:49.825
<i>and if you can find them...</i>

00:49.908 --> 00:52.244
<i>maybe you can hire the A-Team.</i>

02:16.495 --> 02:18.872
Okay, Murdock, what do you see?

02:20.540 --> 02:22.209
I know this. I know this.

02:22.960 --> 02:24.503
Don't tell me, don't tell me.

02:24.586 --> 02:26.588
It's a butterfly, fool,
it's a butterfly.

02:26.672 --> 02:27.923
It's a butterfly, that's
what it is, a butterfly.

02:28.048 --> 02:29.383
I had that.
I would've had that.

02:29.466 --> 02:32.761
There's no right or wrong
to an ink blot test, guys.

02:32.844 --> 02:35.305
It could be a butterfly
or it could be a camel.

02:35.389 --> 02:38.558
It's a camel! I mean, that's what it is.
A camel. I see a camel.

02:38.600 --> 02:39.268
That's right.

02:39.351 --> 02:41.353
I'm hungry.
Where's the next town?

02:41.436 --> 02:43.563
Cannon's Crossing
is about five miles.

02:43.647 --> 02:48.068
And then we're about 200 miles from the
Southern Arizona Mental Testing Center.

02:48.151 --> 02:50.570
You better get going. I got to pass
these tests. Give me another one, Face.

02:50.654 --> 02:51.697
Yeah, okay.

02:53.991 --> 02:55.784
Oh, boy, this one again.

02:55.867 --> 02:57.411
Okay, let me think.

02:57.494 --> 03:00.956
That's a... What do I see? I see...
Is it a dump truck?

03:01.039 --> 03:03.875
No guessing, Murdock.
Just say what you see.

03:03.959 --> 03:07.087
What do I see?
I see... I see...

03:07.587 --> 03:09.881
I see...
See, this guy, Milligan...

03:09.965 --> 03:12.509
is 280 pounds.

03:12.718 --> 03:17.514
I mean, he ripped out every sink out of
every restroom on our floor on the V.A.

03:17.597 --> 03:19.224
I gotta get transferred.
He is crazy.

03:19.308 --> 03:22.019
I mean, he's like imminently
and importantly crazy.

03:22.269 --> 03:24.771
There's the sign for Cannon's Crossing.
Slow down, B.A.

03:24.980 --> 03:28.233
If only I can get
reclassified as neurotic...

03:28.358 --> 03:31.194
or socially deprived with
schizophrenic tendencies...

03:31.278 --> 03:32.571
I mean, then I could be
transferred...

03:32.654 --> 03:34.239
to the fourth floor
outpatient clinic...

03:34.323 --> 03:36.616
and I could get away from
this guy, Milligan.

03:36.992 --> 03:39.745
So, you wanna go with
the dump truck on this one?

03:39.828 --> 03:41.705
It's like a horse
with two heads.

03:42.706 --> 03:45.208
That's a double-headed horsey!
I had that.

03:45.584 --> 03:47.002
I would've had that.

04:10.317 --> 04:11.985
Now that could be them.

04:12.903 --> 04:13.945
Maybe.

04:14.029 --> 04:16.490
They supposed to be in one of
them all-terrain things, though.

04:16.740 --> 04:18.825
Leastways,
that's what the ad says.

04:21.577 --> 04:22.662
Dang!

04:23.372 --> 04:26.583
I don't see why Mr. Kincaid didn't just
tell them to go on out to the ranch.

04:26.708 --> 04:28.001
No!

04:28.251 --> 04:30.295
We've got to sit here and
pick dust out of our ears...

04:30.379 --> 04:32.297
trying to figure out if
it's them or not.

04:38.804 --> 04:41.556
I'm gonna go on over.
You coming?

04:42.265 --> 04:43.558
Maybe.

04:44.643 --> 04:48.105
I'm just not any good
at tests. I get scared.

04:48.313 --> 04:50.399
What about pilot training?
You took a lot of tests.

04:50.482 --> 04:51.358
That's different.

04:51.441 --> 04:53.860
Come on, Face, let's work on
those box cards.

04:53.944 --> 04:55.070
I'm better at those.

04:55.153 --> 04:58.198
Okay, yes, let's see.
There we go.

04:58.407 --> 05:01.785
Now tell me, which one of these
pictures doesn't belong?

05:01.910 --> 05:03.916
That's easy. Cat and
dog don't belong.

05:04.663 --> 05:06.039
It's the saddle, fool!

05:06.164 --> 05:07.624
Can't you see all the
rest of them is animals?

05:07.707 --> 05:08.834
That's what you say.

05:08.917 --> 05:11.795
But everybody knows that a horse
and a saddle go together...

05:11.878 --> 05:13.130
because a saddle goes
on a horse...

05:13.213 --> 05:16.508
and a dog and a cat don't go together
'cause a dog and a cat fight.

05:16.633 --> 05:18.218
Who's the fool now, huh?

05:19.219 --> 05:21.555
They talking about being
crazy and all.

05:22.097 --> 05:24.474
You think that skinny fella
is Insane Wayne?

05:26.810 --> 05:27.936
Maybe.

05:28.687 --> 05:32.023
Okay, I'm gonna talk to them.

05:32.190 --> 05:33.358
How about this one?

05:33.442 --> 05:34.443
Violin don't go.

05:34.526 --> 05:38.613
See, a violin don't make as much noise
as a tuba, or a trumpet or a race car.

05:38.822 --> 05:43.201
Yeah, well, there's a certain
crazy logic to that.

05:43.410 --> 05:44.453
Better believe it.

05:44.536 --> 05:47.747
Excuse me.
I work for Mr. Kincaid.

05:48.999 --> 05:51.877
Are you four fellas the out-of-town
talent that we've been expecting?

05:52.002 --> 05:53.086
I'm sorry, what?

05:53.170 --> 05:55.005
<i>The guys from
Mercenary Magazine...</i>

05:55.088 --> 05:57.799
that Mr. Kincaid hired for that
little piece of funny business.

05:57.924 --> 06:00.510
Well, maybe we are
and maybe we aren't.

06:00.719 --> 06:02.345
That's the killer fella,
ain't he?

06:03.096 --> 06:06.099
Sitting right there is
Insane Wayne, ain't it?

06:07.893 --> 06:11.980
Well, maybe I am, maybe I'm not.

06:12.481 --> 06:14.816
Perhaps you could help us...

06:15.275 --> 06:18.111
by identifying this.

06:21.781 --> 06:22.908
What is that thing?

06:23.033 --> 06:27.162
It's is a pool cue with a
bladder infection, Bingo.

06:28.288 --> 06:29.539
Uh-huh.

06:32.542 --> 06:36.004
Mr. Kincaid's waiting for you. Been
expecting you now for a couple of days.

06:36.254 --> 06:39.007
He's getting kind of mad 'cause he
sent you that $10,000 advance...

06:39.090 --> 06:42.344
and, well, I think he kind of
felt y'all wasn't gonna show.

06:42.427 --> 06:44.346
We don't do business that way.

06:44.513 --> 06:47.849
Things is got a mite dicey since
we wrote you that letter.

06:48.266 --> 06:50.519
That drifter has struck oil
out there.

06:50.894 --> 06:52.854
Son of a gun has shot
the radiator plum out...

06:52.938 --> 06:54.189
of the Kid's brand-new
pickup truck...

06:54.272 --> 06:55.732
when he went up there
try to run him off.

06:55.815 --> 06:56.775
No kidding?

06:56.858 --> 06:58.693
See, we was gonna
handle it ourselves...

06:59.152 --> 07:00.737
but Mr. Kincaid figured
it'd be best...

07:00.820 --> 07:04.199
if the funny stuff was handled
by out-of-town people...

07:04.324 --> 07:07.077
instead of us locals,
if you get my drift.

07:07.744 --> 07:10.080
So, where is Kincaid?

07:10.288 --> 07:12.374
You know, you fellas ought
to not to eat in here.

07:12.874 --> 07:14.876
Their main specialty is grease.

07:15.669 --> 07:17.837
If you come on out to the
ranch, we'll feed you proper.

07:19.005 --> 07:21.299
That's very kind of you.
Thank you, sir.

07:22.217 --> 07:23.969
You're that Insane Wayne guy,
right?

07:24.177 --> 07:26.888
The guy that advertises you killed
all those folks in South America?

07:27.055 --> 07:29.182
Well, chickie-chickie...

07:29.391 --> 07:31.351
if I'm not insane...

07:31.518 --> 07:33.144
I'm not in the game.

07:34.062 --> 07:36.022
We'll be riding
in that blue van...

07:36.147 --> 07:38.024
on account of the Kid's
pickup ain't been fixed yet.

07:38.149 --> 07:40.485
So if y'all just
follow us. Yeah?

07:40.652 --> 07:41.653
Sure.

07:48.577 --> 07:50.620
What do you say, guys?
I'm game.

07:50.745 --> 07:52.747
Hannibal, what the heck
is going on around here?

07:52.831 --> 07:53.957
I don't know, guys.

07:54.040 --> 07:56.835
Look, if we're gonna get him re-tested
and upgraded to outpatient...

07:56.918 --> 07:58.753
we're gonna have to get him
to the testing center.

07:58.878 --> 08:01.715
I think we ought to hang around
here and find out what's happening.

08:01.798 --> 08:05.260
Just as I thought things were
beginning to level off.

08:05.594 --> 08:07.679
Okay, okay, I'm in.

08:54.601 --> 08:55.685
Okay.

08:56.353 --> 08:59.814
Now, they think Murdock is some sort
of loose wheel named Insane Wayne.

08:59.981 --> 09:01.775
The thing to do is
let them do all the talking...

09:01.858 --> 09:02.859
till we get the feel of it.

09:02.942 --> 09:04.235
I'm not sure I like it,
Hannibal.

09:04.319 --> 09:07.322
Do you want to tell me again why
we're getting involved in this mess?

09:07.447 --> 09:09.449
So Murdock can learn his
inkblots.

09:09.616 --> 09:12.619
I mean, if he takes the test
today, we'll lose him forever.

09:13.203 --> 09:13.953
Gotcha.

09:14.037 --> 09:17.749
Hey, listen, I'm getting this stuff
pretty close, if you ask me.

09:20.001 --> 09:21.419
You fellas coming?

09:21.878 --> 09:23.546
Mr. Kincaid's in the den.

09:26.466 --> 09:28.718
Stay in the van.
Keep your eye on the weapons.

09:28.802 --> 09:30.011
Right, Hannibal.

09:58.164 --> 09:59.416
Keep practicin'.

10:08.007 --> 10:11.052
You guys took your
own sweet time getting here.

10:14.097 --> 10:16.933
Put that out.
I don't like cigar smoke.

10:20.770 --> 10:22.063
You Wayne?

10:22.772 --> 10:24.065
It's that fella there.

10:26.484 --> 10:28.445
You Insane Wayne?

10:28.903 --> 10:32.282
Well, if I'm not, I've come
a long ways...

10:32.532 --> 10:34.075
for nothing.

10:38.079 --> 10:40.373
I saw you pull up
outside the window.

10:40.582 --> 10:42.625
Oh, somebody put a rose...

10:42.709 --> 10:44.085
on his nose.

10:44.252 --> 10:47.338
- Where's the assault vehicle?
- You're looking at him.

10:47.630 --> 10:49.674
Where's the guy
you call Fat Rat?

10:49.799 --> 10:51.384
He's in the van.

10:51.509 --> 10:54.304
Great big black fella.
Got lots of jewelry.

10:54.888 --> 10:57.015
The ad didn't say anything
about him being black.

10:57.140 --> 11:00.059
You've got a problem
with that, Jack?

11:00.268 --> 11:01.561
No, sir.

11:02.979 --> 11:05.774
Not as long as you run Bill
Sherman off my property...

11:05.857 --> 11:07.606
I don't have any
problems at all.

11:07.645 --> 11:09.903
Good. No problems.

11:10.111 --> 11:11.946
No problems.

11:16.451 --> 11:17.660
Who's Tully?

11:18.286 --> 11:19.913
Me. I'm Tully.

11:20.079 --> 11:22.707
That makes you're
Three Finger Harry.

11:26.503 --> 11:31.508
Harry couldn't make it. Got a job
running guns in South America.

11:31.591 --> 11:33.092
Well, just who the hell are you?

11:33.176 --> 11:34.761
Pico Bob.

11:35.428 --> 11:36.971
I fill in for Harry.

11:37.055 --> 11:39.140
My specialty is
smoking a cigar...

11:39.224 --> 11:41.059
eating snakes alive...

11:41.267 --> 11:43.269
and running off drifters.

11:43.978 --> 11:45.230
Okay.

11:51.027 --> 11:52.278
Now--

11:56.241 --> 12:00.495
Sherman set up his homestead
a couple of years ago...

12:00.662 --> 12:02.121
over in the East Meadow section.

12:02.205 --> 12:04.165
He cut a road in
from the interstate.

12:04.415 --> 12:08.878
He registered with the Arizona State Land
Commission and got squatter's rights.

12:08.962 --> 12:11.089
Normally, I wouldn't mind that.

12:11.381 --> 12:13.383
As a matter of fact...

12:13.675 --> 12:16.511
I didn't mind at all for
a couple of years.

12:16.594 --> 12:19.430
And then he brought in a well...

12:20.640 --> 12:22.350
and a month ago he hit oil.

12:22.517 --> 12:25.436
That land is mine,
so the oil's mine.

12:25.520 --> 12:27.856
Where's this no-good
squatter set up?

12:29.566 --> 12:32.610
Well, if that red line is your
ranch, he's not on your property.

12:32.777 --> 12:34.153
If he registered
two years ago...

12:34.195 --> 12:35.864
and got squatter's rights,
he's legal.

12:35.947 --> 12:38.616
If I wanted a legal opinion,
I'd seek out a lawyer.

12:38.700 --> 12:41.119
What I want is
a little funny business...

12:41.202 --> 12:45.164
from some guys who don't ask
too many questions.

12:45.248 --> 12:47.000
What do you mean,
"funny business"?

12:47.292 --> 12:50.336
Want us to sneak up on him in
church and give him a hotfoot?

12:50.420 --> 12:51.921
I want you to kill him.

12:52.297 --> 12:54.090
Bury the body two counties over.

12:54.173 --> 12:55.466
Is that plain enough for you?

12:55.550 --> 12:56.968
He out there alone?

12:57.093 --> 12:59.470
He's got a 15-year-old kid
named Bobby.

13:01.556 --> 13:04.475
You think we got enough
firepower to run off...

13:04.601 --> 13:06.728
one drifter and
a 15-year-old kid?

13:06.811 --> 13:10.607
Bill Sherman won the Congressional
Medal of Honor in 'Nam.

13:10.732 --> 13:14.903
He's some kind of colored
beret, green, red. I don't...

13:15.069 --> 13:16.571
Special Forces.

13:16.696 --> 13:20.950
He put three of my men in the hospital when
we paid him a visit one night last week.

13:22.160 --> 13:23.870
Well, what do you think, Wayne?

13:24.203 --> 13:26.347
Maybe we can have some
fun here, after all.

13:26.372 --> 13:27.446
Oh, no!

13:27.540 --> 13:29.959
You can't travel
down that road...

13:30.168 --> 13:34.005
unless they give you a dead
eagle to wear in your hat...

13:34.088 --> 13:35.840
and a flag to bury it in.

13:36.424 --> 13:37.592
Is he all right?

13:37.759 --> 13:40.094
He's a little nuts.

13:40.303 --> 13:41.679
That's--

13:43.473 --> 13:45.642
That's why he's so good.

13:46.392 --> 13:47.810
I'm nuts...

13:48.978 --> 13:50.939
that's why I'm so good.

13:51.064 --> 13:53.858
Yeah, well, get to it, then.

13:54.025 --> 13:56.569
Aren't we forgetting
something, Mr. Kincaid?

13:56.694 --> 13:58.240
Are you talking about money?

13:58.905 --> 14:02.659
I do this not for play
but for pay.

14:02.784 --> 14:04.994
You said on the phone, $100,000.

14:05.119 --> 14:07.080
Half now and half
when the job's finished.

14:07.163 --> 14:08.665
Oh, I know, I know, I know.

14:08.706 --> 14:11.376
But insane people can
change their minds...

14:11.459 --> 14:14.796
from time to time.

14:15.296 --> 14:17.799
I want it all. Now!

14:20.009 --> 14:21.636
What if I say no?

14:24.639 --> 14:28.601
Then I'm gonna put
a pox on your house.

14:36.943 --> 14:38.236
Okay.

14:38.486 --> 14:42.031
Doesn't matter to me,
as long as the job gets done.

14:55.962 --> 14:57.505
Hang on to this, Tully.

14:58.464 --> 15:00.675
So, when do you go in?

15:00.758 --> 15:05.346
Well, Mr. Kincaid, this is one of those
great cases of mistaken identity.

15:05.430 --> 15:07.682
You see, we're not
Insane Wayne, Tully...

15:07.765 --> 15:09.851
Fat Rat, and I'm not Pico Bob.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.270
We're just four guys
passing through.

15:12.353 --> 15:14.731
But something about your offer
attracted us.

15:14.814 --> 15:16.733
Now, Mr. K., they said
they was them--

15:16.816 --> 15:20.737
No, sir, we never did that.
But not to worry.

15:20.820 --> 15:23.197
We'll take this money
and put it to good use.

15:31.914 --> 15:33.166
I'll take my money back.

15:33.249 --> 15:36.335
If the five of you couldn't
run off one drifter...

15:36.753 --> 15:39.255
then you're gonna have
a pile of trouble with us.

15:39.589 --> 15:40.840
Take them.

16:02.278 --> 16:05.406
Now, let me tell you
something else, Kincaid.

16:06.032 --> 16:09.160
We just went to work for Bill
Sherman and you paid our fee.

16:11.120 --> 16:14.957
So when Insane Wayne
and Three Finger Harry...

16:15.083 --> 16:17.668
finally get here,
tell them four other guys...

16:18.503 --> 16:21.547
who were also in the Special
Forces just decided to suit up.

16:21.672 --> 16:23.132
I can read this inkspot
real well.

16:23.216 --> 16:25.510
It's a jackass standing
next to an antique desk.

16:34.519 --> 16:36.145
The wrong guys.

16:37.814 --> 16:40.024
You brought the wrong guys!

16:40.108 --> 16:43.778
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Kincaid, but that
skinny fellow was acting real crazy.

16:45.238 --> 16:46.531
I want them.

16:53.996 --> 16:55.748
How much did we clear, Face?

16:57.458 --> 16:59.335
$90,000. He shorted us.

16:59.460 --> 17:01.712
No, man, there was $10,000
in advance, remember?

17:01.879 --> 17:02.922
Look at this.

17:03.172 --> 17:05.299
"Dirty work, funny business,
we ask no questions.

17:05.383 --> 17:08.511
"Contact Insane Wayne. We'll clean up
your problems the old fashioned way.

17:08.594 --> 17:12.098
"For big jobs, ask for Tully, Fat
Rat and Three Finger Harry."

17:12.223 --> 17:14.099
Well, seeing as we dealt
ourselves into this game...

17:14.183 --> 17:16.060
we might as well see
who's on our side.

17:17.770 --> 17:20.231
Take a right at the next
intersection and head due west.

18:11.449 --> 18:13.618
Hold your fire, we're friendly.

18:20.958 --> 18:23.544
It's an Uzi, he's reloading.
Go, B.A!

18:39.518 --> 18:40.728
Now!

18:50.154 --> 18:51.614
Now where's your father?

19:30.486 --> 19:32.655
Come on, little brother.
We came up here to help.

19:32.863 --> 19:34.282
I don't need any help.

19:34.573 --> 19:36.462
My dad, he taught me
how to survive.

19:36.487 --> 19:37.576
I can make it on my own.

19:37.660 --> 19:39.370
How long has it been since...

19:39.954 --> 19:42.373
You can say it, mister.
They killed him.

19:43.207 --> 19:44.667
Took six of them, though.

19:45.501 --> 19:48.087
At least they never found out
they hit him with a lucky shot.

19:49.839 --> 19:51.549
He's dead and they're
still scared of him.

19:51.757 --> 19:53.843
But they're bringing in
reinforcements, Bob.

19:55.636 --> 19:57.013
Show him the ad.

20:01.100 --> 20:04.103
Insane Wayne,
Three Finger Harry?

20:04.895 --> 20:06.230
You can't be serious.

20:06.397 --> 20:08.357
These guys have a Saturday
morning cartoon show?

20:08.482 --> 20:11.777
Lots of mercenaries got crazy names
so they can't be identified.

20:12.653 --> 20:14.530
Why would you guys wanna buy in?

20:14.864 --> 20:16.741
Well... Been a slow week.

20:16.907 --> 20:19.368
And Kincaid
more or less hired us.

20:19.535 --> 20:20.536
Who are you guys?

20:20.619 --> 20:23.414
Well, that's Hannibal Smith,
B.A. Baracus...

20:23.497 --> 20:25.958
"Howling Mad" Murdock,
and I'm Templeton Peck.

20:26.125 --> 20:27.460
The A-Team?

20:28.044 --> 20:29.837
I'm sure not gonna believe that.

20:29.962 --> 20:32.590
Believe what you want, we're
your teammates from now on...

20:32.673 --> 20:33.924
whether you like it or not.

20:34.050 --> 20:35.885
You can't live out here alone,
little brother.

20:36.010 --> 20:37.011
Watch me.

20:37.178 --> 20:40.681
All it would take is a savvy truant
officer to put you out of business.

20:40.765 --> 20:43.476
You gotta live with
an adult till you're 18.

20:44.143 --> 20:45.019
Did you?

20:45.102 --> 20:47.646
Fact is, you can't
stay out here all by yourself.

20:47.730 --> 20:48.981
People want this well.

20:49.106 --> 20:51.317
Look, my Uncle Charlie
is coming to live with me.

20:51.442 --> 20:52.568
He should be here
in about a week.

20:52.651 --> 20:55.571
You're a pretty tough kid. You're just gonna
play it through. That's the plan, huh?

20:55.696 --> 20:57.156
My dad was a hero.

20:57.782 --> 21:00.076
He won that medal
in the Da Nang Delta.

21:00.576 --> 21:02.244
Had five slugs in him.

21:02.953 --> 21:05.539
Carried three men
out on bamboo litter.

21:06.290 --> 21:09.126
Forty miles through swamps
and VC troops.

21:09.293 --> 21:12.380
So you see, I'm not about to
dishonor his death by crying.

21:12.546 --> 21:15.216
I understood him.
He was the best.

21:16.258 --> 21:17.968
We'll meet again someday...

21:18.761 --> 21:21.472
and I want him to know
that I understood what he was.

21:22.890 --> 21:24.433
And I was proud.

21:24.809 --> 21:26.143
You want the help?

21:27.853 --> 21:31.107
Yeah. Yeah, maybe. Why not?

21:35.236 --> 21:37.238
You guys aren't really
the A-Team.

21:37.363 --> 21:40.032
We could sure use the A-Team, though.
I mean, I could.

21:40.241 --> 21:42.868
Why don't you get some sleep.
How long you been up anyway?

21:42.993 --> 21:44.495
Most of two days now.

21:44.662 --> 21:46.622
I had to stay awake,
I had to protect this place.

21:46.747 --> 21:49.834
Well, we'll wake you up
in about four hours...

21:50.167 --> 21:51.961
and let you take a watch
with the rest of us.

21:52.628 --> 21:55.548
B.A. and Hannibal are out there
setting up a perimeter right now.

21:55.673 --> 21:58.008
You keep calling
them Hannibal and B.A...

21:58.092 --> 21:59.426
like they were really
the A-Team, huh?

21:59.552 --> 22:01.262
We are. I'm H.M. Murdock.

22:01.345 --> 22:03.514
I was their pilot over there.
And...

22:04.348 --> 22:06.976
You just watch us
and you make up your own mind.

22:07.059 --> 22:08.894
And your father would have
known who we were.

22:09.103 --> 22:11.147
'Cause we were famous in 'Nam.

22:16.652 --> 22:18.904
Looks like they started drilling
here and got down a ways...

22:19.029 --> 22:20.322
and hit some rock...

22:20.865 --> 22:23.492
and then moved over east, punched
through, and hit the right spot.

22:28.455 --> 22:30.291
We can use this hole, Hannibal.

22:31.417 --> 22:34.628
Okay, Face, you and Murdock go out
to that highway we came in on...

22:34.753 --> 22:36.714
and wait for Insane Wayne
and his animal act.

22:36.797 --> 22:40.426
And what are we gonna do? Tell him
his services are no longer required?

22:40.593 --> 22:42.595
It's not gonna work. He's
come a long way, Hannibal.

22:42.720 --> 22:44.180
He's gonna want his money.

22:44.305 --> 22:46.223
Face, you're a fountain
of creativity.

22:46.307 --> 22:47.933
You will think of something.

22:49.310 --> 22:51.562
Arizona. What do they do
a lot of in Arizona?

22:51.645 --> 22:52.521
Let's see.

22:53.355 --> 22:55.274
Don't tell me, I'll get it.

22:56.358 --> 22:58.944
Relax, Murdock. This isn't
a mental agility test.

22:59.069 --> 23:02.239
I know they set off some hellacious
nukes out there in Arizona in the '50s.

23:02.364 --> 23:03.282
No, they didn't.

23:03.365 --> 23:05.492
I know I'll get some of this
stuff straight sooner or later.

23:05.576 --> 23:07.286
What's the difference, right?

23:07.369 --> 23:09.205
I have an idea.

23:09.371 --> 23:10.748
Well, then, get going.

23:10.831 --> 23:13.417
We gotta buy some time
to fix this place up.

23:13.918 --> 23:17.546
You guys, turn Wayne around.
Get us at least half a day.

23:17.880 --> 23:18.923
Right.

23:19.423 --> 23:22.176
Okay, Murdock, you better get the
uniforms out of the back of the van.

23:22.259 --> 23:25.304
Oh, and get a tape recorder and
that big portable radio of B.A.'s.

23:25.329 --> 23:26.122
Right.

24:43.507 --> 24:44.550
How you doing?

24:44.633 --> 24:45.676
What do you got going here?

24:46.343 --> 24:47.303
Wind shift.

24:47.386 --> 24:49.930
Yeah, we're testing the new
J-series cluster rockets...

24:50.222 --> 24:52.558
and one of our jet jocks
had a gyro out of whack...

24:52.641 --> 24:55.019
and hit a target
outside the test perimeter...

24:55.102 --> 24:57.354
and, well, then the winds turned around.
Well, we got a...

24:57.396 --> 25:01.442
Just a little
fallout headed this way.

25:01.525 --> 25:04.653
Corky, Corky, you want to run a
check on this truck here? Yeah.

25:06.113 --> 25:07.156
Where you fellows from?

25:07.281 --> 25:10.034
Down this highway,
all the way from Cooperstown.

25:10.159 --> 25:12.077
I got 60 DB and a rain-up
on the oscillator.

25:12.202 --> 25:14.997
Oh, boy, oh, boy, it spread
further than I thought.

25:15.289 --> 25:16.582
What the hell's going on here?

25:16.707 --> 25:17.833
Holy!

25:19.126 --> 25:22.463
Look, you boys are okay,
but you gotta turn around.

25:22.546 --> 25:24.298
Okay?
What do you mean, "okay"?

25:24.423 --> 25:25.966
This guy here
is getting a reading.

25:26.091 --> 25:28.635
Oh, well,
it's nothing to worry about.

25:28.719 --> 25:31.055
What, are you kidding me?
I read the papers, boy.

25:31.221 --> 25:32.931
You guys screw up on the test...

25:33.015 --> 25:34.767
you contaminate
this whole countryside...

25:34.850 --> 25:36.518
and you don't say squat
to nobody.

25:36.810 --> 25:38.562
It's nothing like that.

25:39.563 --> 25:40.481
Where're you headed?

25:40.564 --> 25:41.774
Cannon Crossing.

25:41.899 --> 25:43.400
Cannon...
Cannon...

25:43.484 --> 25:45.194
Oh, look,
you've gotta turn around.

25:45.277 --> 25:47.696
You gotta go back 40 miles
to the Annandale turnoff.

25:47.780 --> 25:49.740
That'll take you north of the
Claxton mountain range, see?

25:49.823 --> 25:52.368
Then you follow that
up to the South Fork, and...

25:52.534 --> 25:55.829
well, you take that past,
past Riverton...

25:55.954 --> 25:57.247
and that'll bring you around
on the other side of this--

25:57.373 --> 25:58.415
Excuse me!

25:58.749 --> 26:01.126
What you're describing here
is gonna take half the night.

26:01.210 --> 26:02.544
We're late as it is!

26:02.628 --> 26:03.796
This position
is being overrun...

26:03.879 --> 26:05.464
and we're at a point
of contamination already.

26:05.547 --> 26:08.842
Oh, no. You better break out the radiation
suits. Get them out of the back of the jeep.

26:08.926 --> 26:11.220
Right. And we'll move this
position up 15 miles!

26:11.345 --> 26:12.763
All right,
you've made your point.

26:12.888 --> 26:13.889
I'm out of here.

26:14.014 --> 26:15.933
Good. Good. Good decision.

26:27.945 --> 26:30.781
Well, if that's Insane Wayne, they
certainly got the right name for him.

26:30.906 --> 26:32.964
Yeah. Let's get out of here
before a cop shows up.

26:32.989 --> 26:34.118
- Sure.
- Right.

26:40.416 --> 26:43.001
Okay, Face.
Your turn on guard duty.

26:46.422 --> 26:48.590
Sic him, Murdock.
I'll go get Bobby.

26:53.720 --> 26:55.514
Oh, come on.

27:06.358 --> 27:08.485
His bike's gone.
He took the Uzi.

27:08.610 --> 27:09.486
You don't think
he's gonna try to...

27:09.570 --> 27:11.029
take those guys on
by himself, do you?

27:11.113 --> 27:13.449
They killed his father.
He's liable to do anything.

27:13.532 --> 27:15.451
When we get to Kincaid's,
we're gonna spread out.

27:15.534 --> 27:17.619
Come in from different sides,
use the walkie-talkies.

27:17.703 --> 27:20.289
This is a recon mission.
If he's not there, we get out.

27:20.372 --> 27:23.125
I don't like it, Hannibal. I think
he's gonna get in a lot of trouble.

27:23.292 --> 27:24.585
Depends on what he's doing.

27:29.465 --> 27:31.467
I can't stay long.
I snuck out.

27:31.800 --> 27:32.926
Me, too.

27:33.927 --> 27:35.012
How's your dad?

27:35.137 --> 27:36.472
He's not my dad.

27:36.597 --> 27:38.640
He's the man
who married my mother.

27:39.057 --> 27:40.767
My daddy died in the war.

27:40.893 --> 27:42.186
You know what I meant.

27:43.395 --> 27:45.189
We gotta get out of here, Bob.

27:45.397 --> 27:47.983
I can't stand the way
he treats me.

27:48.150 --> 27:50.611
He just married my mom
to get our ranch and...

27:50.777 --> 27:52.488
There's something
wrong with him.

27:52.779 --> 27:54.323
He hits my mom.

27:54.448 --> 27:56.283
Look, I got some help.

27:56.408 --> 27:57.618
It won't be long.

27:57.701 --> 27:58.994
Who's gonna help us?

27:59.077 --> 28:00.496
I think it's the A-Team.

28:00.621 --> 28:02.122
The A-Team?

28:02.289 --> 28:04.875
Come on.
Why would they wanna help us?

28:06.376 --> 28:07.336
Who told them?

28:07.503 --> 28:08.504
I don't know.

28:08.754 --> 28:10.172
I'm not even sure it's them.

28:10.464 --> 28:12.007
But they seem to
know what they're doing.

28:12.132 --> 28:13.675
Be careful, Bobby.

28:17.429 --> 28:20.516
Tomorrow night, this whole thing'll
be over. One way or another.

28:20.682 --> 28:23.018
If I'm still standing,
I'll be back for you.

28:23.435 --> 28:24.937
I love you.

28:28.982 --> 28:30.192
Get inside!

28:36.073 --> 28:38.158
Scratch Plan A, go to Plan B.

28:48.085 --> 28:50.212
Come on, Bobby!
Get in the van!

28:59.596 --> 29:00.806
Go, B.A.

29:06.144 --> 29:07.980
Okay, I'm convinced.

29:08.397 --> 29:09.982
You guys really are the A-Team.

29:16.446 --> 29:19.575
Julie and I have been kind of going
steady since the sixth grade.

29:19.908 --> 29:21.618
That was before
her mom married Kincaid...

29:21.827 --> 29:23.495
and Julie was still
allowed to go to school.

29:23.745 --> 29:26.039
Kincaid don't let
his stepdaughter go to school?

29:26.206 --> 29:28.333
Well, he has tutors
come up to the ranch.

29:28.500 --> 29:29.960
She never leaves there.

29:30.335 --> 29:31.753
He's a real scuzz.

29:31.837 --> 29:33.130
Her mom just stays in her room.

29:33.297 --> 29:34.798
Doesn't go into town anymore.

29:35.048 --> 29:37.175
So you did your Romeo act
till you got caught.

29:37.259 --> 29:39.052
Hey, I've been going
up there for months.

29:39.303 --> 29:40.846
They just never picked up on it.

29:41.388 --> 29:42.889
I never see her
anymore otherwise.

29:42.973 --> 29:45.601
I think that shows a lot of
initiative on your part, Bobby.

29:45.809 --> 29:47.477
You know, where I come from,
it was lot tougher.

29:47.561 --> 29:49.479
See, in the city you're
dealing with fire escapes--

29:49.605 --> 29:51.898
- Face.
- Later.

29:52.274 --> 29:53.734
Come on, guys.
We'll be late for the service.

29:53.900 --> 29:56.528
Face, please, can I talk to you?
Just for a second. Please?

29:59.406 --> 30:00.824
Face, I'm starting
to get worried.

30:00.907 --> 30:03.410
I mean, with everything
that has been going on...

30:03.535 --> 30:05.621
we haven't been
working with my flash cards.

30:05.829 --> 30:07.331
Oh! Oh, yeah.

30:07.414 --> 30:09.708
Okay, well, we can
do it on the way.

30:09.875 --> 30:12.044
All right, well, let's see.

30:12.127 --> 30:15.172
What's the mathematical
significance of these?

30:16.465 --> 30:20.052
That's a tough one, Face.
They're not gonna ask that one.

30:20.135 --> 30:22.846
- Go, go on to the next one.
- Just answer the question.

30:24.973 --> 30:26.433
None of them.
None of them do.

30:26.516 --> 30:29.811
All of them. They're parallel
and perpendicular, see?

30:30.854 --> 30:31.813
Face.

30:31.980 --> 30:34.983
I would've got it.
I just have a lot on my mind.

30:37.152 --> 30:38.320
Come on, guys.

30:38.403 --> 30:41.114
We don't wanna be late for
Bobby's dad's memorial service.

30:46.787 --> 30:48.747
Captain William F. Sherman...

30:48.955 --> 30:51.333
was a man who stood up
for what he believed...

30:51.583 --> 30:53.418
despite intolerable odds.

30:54.044 --> 30:56.338
His land, his country...

30:56.421 --> 31:00.092
being both father and mother
and friend...

31:00.342 --> 31:02.928
Bill Sherman
died a hero's death.

31:03.762 --> 31:05.263
He gave his life for freedom.

31:05.472 --> 31:09.059
And for his son, that was
his father's greatest gift.

31:19.194 --> 31:20.821
Real sorry, son.

31:21.321 --> 31:24.324
About what? That you didn't know
three days earlier he was dead?

31:25.659 --> 31:27.661
Your daddy should've
taught you better manners.

31:27.786 --> 31:29.663
My daddy taught me fine.

31:42.926 --> 31:44.469
I'm really glad you came, Julie.

31:44.636 --> 31:46.555
I wanted to come alone, Bobby.

31:46.638 --> 31:48.473
I wanted to be with you.

31:49.057 --> 31:50.726
But he wouldn't let me.

31:52.436 --> 31:55.147
I believe you have
something that belongs to me.

31:55.480 --> 31:57.149
Depends on
what you're looking for.

31:57.441 --> 31:59.776
My $100,000 that you stole.

32:01.778 --> 32:03.280
Why don't you tell the Sheriff?

32:03.488 --> 32:04.656
Then we can all go over...

32:04.740 --> 32:06.992
and have a good laugh on
the circumstances involved.

32:07.075 --> 32:09.661
Look, let's get right to
the guts of this matter.

32:09.786 --> 32:10.912
By all means.

32:11.079 --> 32:13.623
I want that land.
I'm willing to pay.

32:13.874 --> 32:15.041
I'm ready to make a deal.

32:15.125 --> 32:18.837
What's that? $50,000 to whoever
can run Bobby Sherman and us off?

32:19.087 --> 32:22.174
I've got a deal of considerable
standing to make to the boy.

32:22.340 --> 32:24.926
He's young. He's got
his whole life ahead of him.

32:24.968 --> 32:26.720
Probably got future plans.

32:26.845 --> 32:28.555
I think he should have a chance.

32:28.889 --> 32:30.265
Change of heart.

32:30.432 --> 32:32.893
I think Bobby should at least
have a chance to hear me out.

32:33.018 --> 32:34.102
So do I.

32:34.436 --> 32:36.480
How about you and the boy
coming for dinner tonight?

32:36.563 --> 32:37.898
How about we don't?

32:38.482 --> 32:39.691
All right.

32:40.984 --> 32:42.861
We'll meet in a neutral place.

32:43.069 --> 32:44.321
Red Rock Canyon.

32:44.404 --> 32:46.031
It's about four miles
north of here.

32:46.114 --> 32:48.784
It's open,
nice little clearing, flat.

32:49.367 --> 32:51.787
Everybody in plain sight.
No weapons.

32:51.870 --> 32:54.414
Somehow I feel
that only applies to us.

32:56.374 --> 32:58.376
My men'll be
all out in the open.

32:58.960 --> 33:01.046
No monkey business.
You have my word on it.

33:01.922 --> 33:03.965
And my word's as good as yours.

33:28.406 --> 33:30.659
Well, you know
he's gonna double-cross us.

33:31.117 --> 33:32.536
Yeah. But we're gonna
double-cross him.

33:32.619 --> 33:33.912
That's what makes it fair.

34:00.313 --> 34:01.606
Okay, B.A.

34:05.360 --> 34:06.862
Step into my office.

34:17.998 --> 34:21.293
$100,000.
That's my offer.

34:22.127 --> 34:24.963
I don't understand.
What are you trying to pull?

34:25.088 --> 34:27.132
I'm just trying to close
a business deal.

34:27.632 --> 34:29.175
Trying to negotiate business.

34:29.259 --> 34:31.636
That's what adults do
when they want something.

34:31.761 --> 34:33.679
I give you $100,000,

34:33.804 --> 34:35.849
you sign the property
over to me...

34:36.224 --> 34:37.391
then you take off.

34:37.516 --> 34:39.101
You killed my dad.

34:40.020 --> 34:41.146
Son...

34:42.188 --> 34:43.815
what happened to your dad...

34:43.899 --> 34:46.275
was due as much as it was to
anything else as his stubbornness.

34:46.359 --> 34:48.904
Now I suggest
you take that money...

34:49.029 --> 34:50.405
and get out of town.

34:50.655 --> 34:52.616
This one's a little shy.

34:52.699 --> 34:55.702
Well, it's $100,000 or so.

34:55.784 --> 34:57.787
You forgot to mention
the "or so."

34:57.871 --> 35:02.626
Whatever it is, it's enough for this kid
to live real healthy on for a long time.

35:04.586 --> 35:06.838
It's up to you, Bob.
It's your decision.

35:06.922 --> 35:08.506
Stuff your money, Kincaid.

35:08.590 --> 35:11.343
I'm keeping my dad's land
and I'm working my dad's well.

35:11.509 --> 35:13.219
He died trying to protect it.

35:14.304 --> 35:15.972
If you come around us again...

35:16.222 --> 35:18.058
you're gonna die
trying to take it.

35:18.850 --> 35:22.103
Well, I guess that's the end of the
friendly part of these negotiations.

35:22.187 --> 35:23.980
I can't believe
y'all are so dumb.

35:24.064 --> 35:25.899
Yeah, dumb as a bag of rocks.

35:26.191 --> 35:27.317
But smart enough to figure...

35:27.442 --> 35:28.985
you might put a sniper...

35:29.069 --> 35:30.904
in that stand of trees
over there.

35:31.071 --> 35:33.698
And maybe another one in that
stand of trees over there.

35:34.449 --> 35:37.827
And so we mined
those potential ambush sites.

35:38.370 --> 35:39.579
I don't believe you.

35:39.913 --> 35:42.082
Never bet into aces, pal.

35:42.415 --> 35:44.376
B.A., cut some lumber.

36:15.115 --> 36:16.199
You all right, B.A.?

36:16.241 --> 36:17.701
Just stay down.

36:29.170 --> 36:30.463
They did it again.

36:32.340 --> 36:34.551
They took my money again.

36:37.637 --> 36:40.015
They shorted us a couple
of bills in each packet.

36:40.140 --> 36:41.683
The guy's a sneak thief.

36:42.559 --> 36:43.810
You sure
you're all right, B.A.?

36:43.893 --> 36:45.729
Yeah, it went
right through, Hannibal.

36:45.895 --> 36:47.522
I gotta get it
stitched up, though.

36:47.605 --> 36:48.732
I'm really sorry, B.A.

36:48.815 --> 36:50.025
You know,
I never would've said no...

36:50.108 --> 36:51.526
if I knew
anyone was gonna get hurt.

36:51.735 --> 36:53.069
You did the right thing, Bobby.

36:53.153 --> 36:54.571
You did the right thing.

36:58.700 --> 37:00.535
Now, I've heard your excuses!

37:00.618 --> 37:02.162
What I want now is action!

37:02.245 --> 37:03.663
That's what I say.

37:05.040 --> 37:07.125
Who are you? And what are
you doing in my office?

37:07.250 --> 37:08.209
You Kincaid?

37:08.334 --> 37:09.711
And that's his chair.

37:10.086 --> 37:11.337
Now out!

37:19.554 --> 37:22.057
I'm tired of being
run around the brush, Kincaid.

37:22.223 --> 37:23.516
You sent for me.

37:24.392 --> 37:25.977
Insane Wayne.

37:27.312 --> 37:29.314
- Julie, get back to your room.
- But--

37:29.397 --> 37:31.232
You heard your daddy.
Now get.

37:36.905 --> 37:39.991
Well, it's no wonder you low
volts had such trouble...

37:40.075 --> 37:41.826
containing an old-timer
and his son.

37:41.910 --> 37:44.037
Well, first of all,
the guy was a Green Beret!

37:44.120 --> 37:46.456
I'm not afraid of no hat,
Chicken Lickin'.

37:46.623 --> 37:49.876
The fact is, the father's dead.

37:51.002 --> 37:52.378
Been dead almost a week.

37:52.504 --> 37:53.630
Don't lie to me!

37:53.713 --> 37:54.923
I talked you two days ago...

37:55.006 --> 37:56.758
and you were still
being held off.

37:56.883 --> 37:58.384
That was the son!

37:59.094 --> 38:02.722
A 15-year-old kid?
I'm sorry, chief.

38:02.806 --> 38:05.141
Me and my men
don't raid nurseries.

38:05.225 --> 38:07.602
That boy's got the A-Team
working for him now.

38:07.727 --> 38:09.020
The A-Team?

38:10.897 --> 38:11.940
Out of sight.

38:12.357 --> 38:14.818
Let me go!
Let me go!

38:14.901 --> 38:16.069
What are you doing?

38:16.152 --> 38:18.279
Found her talking
real low on the phone.

38:18.488 --> 38:20.156
Sounded kind of strange.

38:20.448 --> 38:22.992
She was telling somebody
that we were here...

38:23.201 --> 38:25.662
and they should get ready for an attack.
Didn't you?

38:26.788 --> 38:27.997
Julie.

38:28.164 --> 38:30.875
She's in love with that boy.
I been trying to tell you.

38:30.959 --> 38:32.377
She's in love with the kid, huh?

38:32.544 --> 38:34.379
The A-Team's gonna
be looking for you.

38:34.462 --> 38:36.714
Especially if you try to
come in through the back door.

38:36.965 --> 38:39.050
Sometimes the front door
is easier.

38:39.342 --> 38:40.677
If you have the key.

38:40.802 --> 38:43.179
Whoa, now. You're not
taking her to use for bait.

38:43.263 --> 38:45.181
You want that land or not?

38:53.148 --> 38:54.274
Take her.

39:24.304 --> 39:25.638
Here they come.

39:38.234 --> 39:39.444
Get down.

40:25.114 --> 40:26.491
All right, Smith!

40:26.658 --> 40:28.993
I want you and your men
out here now!

40:29.118 --> 40:30.954
Drop your weapons and stand up!

40:31.204 --> 40:32.497
No deal, pal.

40:32.580 --> 40:34.999
We can hold you off
all day long!

40:35.166 --> 40:37.001
I don't think so, Smith.

40:37.710 --> 40:40.713
Not unless you wanna see
this twist get broken.

40:40.797 --> 40:41.923
Julie!

40:42.173 --> 40:43.466
Let her go!

40:43.716 --> 40:45.093
She's got nothing
to do with this.

40:45.218 --> 40:47.512
She's got everything
to do with this!

40:48.680 --> 40:51.391
Well, come on.
Where's your plumbing, chief?

40:51.516 --> 40:53.017
You're the A-Team!

40:53.226 --> 40:55.228
You can shoot me down cold.

40:55.353 --> 40:57.105
Right through
this little duckie.

40:57.230 --> 40:58.940
Or do you want me
to do it for you?

41:00.566 --> 41:01.693
Bobby.

41:03.403 --> 41:06.698
Well, you must be the puppy
that held off Kincaid's boys.

41:06.823 --> 41:10.076
All right, Smith! I'm through
talking, come on out!

41:10.576 --> 41:12.203
Or they both eat it.

41:21.587 --> 41:22.880
Where's the others?

41:22.964 --> 41:25.008
There's three members
of the A-Team.

41:26.342 --> 41:29.429
And Kincaid said that there was a
fourth working out here somewhere.

41:29.554 --> 41:31.764
Had a man wounded
at Red Rock Mesa.

41:32.432 --> 41:34.726
It took another man to take
him to the hospital...

41:34.809 --> 41:36.144
at Willow Springs.

41:36.394 --> 41:40.106
Well, I'd hate to think that you've
got some kind of ambush set up here.

41:40.273 --> 41:42.567
What are your thoughts
on the subject, Finger?

41:58.958 --> 42:02.628
Well, I guess
there's no one hiding here.

42:16.434 --> 42:17.769
You know what I'm thinking?

42:17.894 --> 42:20.271
That the A-Team wouldn't be
this easy to take down.

42:20.355 --> 42:22.982
No. I'm thinking
where the money is.

42:23.232 --> 42:27.779
Oh, I'm talking about that
$100,000 you took from Kincaid.

42:28.613 --> 42:30.990
I'd like it. It's mine.

42:31.074 --> 42:33.951
Well, I might just take
the whereabouts of that...

42:34.035 --> 42:35.244
to the great beyond.

42:35.328 --> 42:39.457
Not unless you wanna take these
two kids along with that secret.

42:45.129 --> 42:46.631
You'll trade them for the money?

42:47.632 --> 42:49.175
You've got my word.

42:49.592 --> 42:52.345
You and Kincaid
must get along really great.

42:52.428 --> 42:54.347
I guess we better show him
where it's hidden.

43:01.687 --> 43:03.064
Would you say...

43:04.690 --> 43:05.942
about there?

44:06.961 --> 44:08.337
How's the shoulder, B.A.?

44:08.421 --> 44:09.755
It's fine, Hannibal.

44:09.881 --> 44:11.549
It's a mathematical equation.

44:11.674 --> 44:15.052
Four thugs equals $200,000.

44:16.012 --> 44:18.306
<i>I may pass that loony test yet.</i>

44:34.488 --> 44:35.531
You Bobby's uncle?

44:35.615 --> 44:36.616
Yeah.

44:37.992 --> 44:39.368
Who are you guys?

44:39.827 --> 44:41.078
Friends.

44:44.290 --> 44:46.792
I drove 76 hours straight
to get here.

44:48.211 --> 44:50.546
He always said I was gonna
come to his funeral...

44:52.006 --> 44:53.549
instead of the other way around.

44:54.191 --> 44:55.646
I'm 10 years older than Billy...

44:57.350 --> 44:59.263
but he was always
the risk-taker.

44:59.513 --> 45:03.100
He was always the one
who was trying to be faster...

45:03.976 --> 45:05.436
sharper...

45:06.854 --> 45:08.272
more fair.

45:13.486 --> 45:14.612
Where's little Bobby?

45:14.695 --> 45:16.572
Well, little Bobby
isn't so little anymore.

45:16.656 --> 45:19.367
He's with his girlfriend,
down the creekbed a ways.

45:19.492 --> 45:21.160
Bobby has a girlfriend?

45:22.036 --> 45:24.205
Son of a gun.

45:25.873 --> 45:27.833
Last time I saw him, he...

45:31.337 --> 45:34.090
Well, I guess
he and I ought to...

45:34.757 --> 45:36.092
find a place in town.

45:36.300 --> 45:38.594
I think he gonna
want to stay out here.

45:44.016 --> 45:45.726
Just like his old man, ain't he?

45:47.979 --> 45:51.732
Well, I guess
here's as good a place as any.

45:54.151 --> 45:55.486
This is for Bobby.

45:55.736 --> 45:58.781
It's his future.
His dad earned it for him.

46:04.370 --> 46:06.122
So your mom's gonna be okay?

46:06.664 --> 46:07.748
Yeah.

46:07.999 --> 46:09.625
He had her on drugs.

46:09.834 --> 46:11.752
She's in the hospital now...

46:11.919 --> 46:15.631
and Kincaid'll have 20 years in
prison to think about what he did.

46:17.300 --> 46:19.510
I can't believe it's all over.

46:20.011 --> 46:21.470
If it weren't for you, Bobby,
it wouldn't be--

46:21.595 --> 46:23.931
No, no, no.
It was the A-Team that did it.

46:24.432 --> 46:25.433
You know, every now and then...

46:25.516 --> 46:28.269
my dad used to talk about
his assault team in 'Nam...

46:28.561 --> 46:30.354
how he felt about those guys.

46:30.646 --> 46:32.898
He said he owed them more
than a man could ever pay.

46:33.190 --> 46:35.401
Now you feel that way
about the A-Team.

46:36.152 --> 46:38.612
Some debts
just can never be repaid.

46:41.449 --> 46:42.700
I love you.

46:42.867 --> 46:45.494
For the life of me, sometimes
I can't figure out why.

46:45.828 --> 46:47.496
Because you're real.

46:47.663 --> 46:50.291
You count for something
that's very rare.

46:50.750 --> 46:52.501
Well, it's good to know
I have somebody fooled.

46:52.626 --> 46:53.919
It's true.

46:54.086 --> 46:56.839
If you could see what I see,
you'd know.

46:57.006 --> 46:58.883
Come on, I wanna get back
before they leave.

46:59.050 --> 47:00.384
I wanna say thanks.

47:06.557 --> 47:09.393
I don't think they're the men
who wait around to be thanked.
