11:49.805 --> 11:53.244
COLE NEEDS CLOSURE,
AND SO DO I.

11:53.344 --> 11:56.995
WE WILL CREATE
A DISTRACTION OUTSIDE

11:57.095 --> 12:01.010
IN CASE YOUR SPELL INSIDE
CREATES ANY FIREWORKS.

12:01.342 --> 12:04.468
BE CAREFUL.

12:19.257 --> 12:22.656
UNLESS WE SPIKE
THE LEMONADE,

12:22.756 --> 12:25.405
I DON'T KNOW--
SHH!

12:25.505 --> 12:26.839
THAT PHONE COMPANY VAN
LOOKS SUSPICIOUS.

12:27.005 --> 12:30.071
WHY?

12:30.171 --> 12:32.236
WELL, BECAUSE
IT WASN'T THERE EARLIER,

12:32.336 --> 12:34.319
AND BESIDES,
HE DIDN'T PUT OUT ANY CONES.

12:34.419 --> 12:37.235
THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE BASING IT ON?

12:37.335 --> 12:39.234
WELL, IT'S THE BEST
THAT I GOT, OK?

12:39.334 --> 12:41.485
NOW, ARE YOU READY?

12:41.585 --> 12:42.693
WHY DON'T YOU JUST...
TO THE STREET?

12:42.793 --> 12:45.401
BECAUSE WHAT IF SOMEBODY
DRIVES AROUND THE CORNER
MID...

12:45.501 --> 12:48.708
NOW, YOU JUST NEED TO USE
SOME OF YOUR GOD-GIVEN MAGIC.

12:50.332 --> 12:53.415
OK? GO!

13:17.953 --> 13:21.618
ANYONE FEEL LIKE
A...LITTLE COOL-DOWN?

13:28.866 --> 13:32.573
EASY, BOYS, THERE'S
ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE.

14:11.816 --> 14:15.297
"WHITHER MY LOVE,
WHEREVER YOU BE,

14:15.397 --> 14:17.523
THROUGH TIME AND SPACE
TAKE MY HEART NEAR
TO THEE."

14:34.309 --> 14:37.209
AAH!

14:37.309 --> 14:38.501
COLE!

14:38.601 --> 14:39.876
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

14:39.976 --> 14:41.168
NOBODY'S ALLOWED
TO BE HERE!

14:41.268 --> 14:42.959
HERE?
WHERE IS HERE?

14:43.059 --> 14:45.307
WE GOTTA MOVE FAST.
COME ON!

14:59.555 --> 15:03.203
WE'LL BE SAFE HERE,
BUT NOT FOR LONG.

15:03.303 --> 15:06.620
WE HAVE TO KEEP MOVING,
OR THE BEAST'LL
DEVOUR US BOTH...

15:06.720 --> 15:10.094
FOR ETERNITY.

15:11.761 --> 15:15.300
I KNEW
YOU'D HEAR MY CRIES.

15:17.010 --> 15:18.299
UH, COLE--

15:20.299 --> 15:21.199
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

15:21.299 --> 15:22.701
YOU DID
THE RIGHT THING.

15:22.801 --> 15:24.925
THE SOURCE IS GONE,
DEVOURED.

15:26.466 --> 15:28.049
THIS IS THE WASTELAND

15:30.007 --> 15:32.589
WHERE ALL VANQUISHED
DEMONS END UP.

15:33.296 --> 15:34.296
THE BEAST FEEDS
ON THEIR ESSENCE...

15:37.005 --> 15:38.780
THEIR POWERS.

15:38.880 --> 15:40.588
SO WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

15:42.294 --> 15:43.213
HOLDING ON TO OUR LOVE.

15:45.629 --> 15:47.128
I'M A DEMON
WITH A SOUL, PHOEBE.

15:48.419 --> 15:50.402
THAT'S RATHER UNIQUE
TO THE COSMOS.

15:50.502 --> 15:52.376
THAT'S WHY MY SOUL HAS
BEEN ABLE TO CLING HERE
AND KEEP FROM MOVING ON.

15:52.794 --> 15:56.191
OH, BUT
THAT'S NOT HEALTHY.

15:56.291 --> 15:58.776
EVERYONE
HAS TO MOVE ON,

15:58.876 --> 16:00.983
YOU KNOW,
SOONER OR LATER.

16:01.083 --> 16:03.233
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S
EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.

16:03.333 --> 16:05.540
YOU'LL GET TO GO
TO THE GOOD PLACE. ME...

16:10.414 --> 16:13.814
OVER HERE. COME ON.

16:13.914 --> 16:15.980
EEK!

16:16.080 --> 16:17.330
OH!

16:22.953 --> 16:27.020
OK, YOU KNOW,
YOU CAN'T KEEP RUNNING
FROM THAT THING FOREVER.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.435
THAT'S WHY
I'VE BEEN CALLING YOU.

16:29.535 --> 16:32.183
YOU CAN HELP SAVE ME.

16:32.283 --> 16:34.102
WELL, SAVE US.

16:34.202 --> 16:35.183
HOW?

16:35.283 --> 16:36.517
GET LEO TO THE <i>GRIMOIRE.</i>

16:36.617 --> 16:38.182
THAT RESURRECTION SPELL
THAT THE WIZARD
WAS AFTER?

16:38.282 --> 16:40.892
YOU CAN USE THAT
TO RESURRECT ME.

16:40.992 --> 16:43.181
WHAT?!

16:43.281 --> 16:44.432
IT'S EASY. I'LL
WALK YOU THROUGH IT.

16:44.532 --> 16:46.615
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS--

16:48.280 --> 16:51.555
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

16:51.655 --> 16:52.906
I, UH, I CAN'T USE
DARK MAGIC AGAIN.

16:54.156 --> 16:57.178
I WON'T.

16:57.278 --> 16:58.488
NOT EVEN FOR US?

17:10.275 --> 17:13.358
[SCREAMING]

17:14.233 --> 17:15.901
YOUR POWERS!

17:17.317 --> 17:19.150
I DON'T HAVE ANY POWERS!

17:20.983 --> 17:24.271

[SCREAMING]

17:29.271 --> 17:32.130
Paige: WHAT'S THE MATTER?!
WHAT'S HAPPENING?!

17:32.230 --> 17:34.170
WE GOTTA BREAK THE SPELL!
SOMETHING'S HURTING HER.

17:34.270 --> 17:36.338
SOMETHING IS KILLING HER!

17:36.438 --> 17:38.962
I CAN'T...HOLD ON.

17:39.062 --> 17:41.544
AAAH!

17:41.644 --> 17:43.795
PAIGE, HERE. REVERSAL SPELL.

17:43.895 --> 17:45.461
Both: "RETURN THY LOVE,
WHEREVER SHE BE.

17:45.561 --> 17:48.267
THROUGH TIME AND SPACE,
BRING HER BACK TO ME."

17:53.684 --> 17:56.833
[GASPS]

17:56.933 --> 17:58.541
IT'S OK. YOU'RE OK.

17:58.641 --> 18:00.599
OH, MY GOD.
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

18:04.140 --> 18:05.556
[DOORBELL CHIMES]
UH-OH.

18:07.598 --> 18:10.055
I HOPE THE FREEZE
DIDN'T WEAR OFF.

18:16.221 --> 18:19.370
AGENT JACKMAN, FBI.

18:19.470 --> 18:22.303
WE SHOULD TALK.

18:28.843 --> 18:32.675
IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING,
THAT'S JUST A COPY.

18:33.092 --> 18:35.257
NICE WAY
TO ENGENDER TRUST,
AGENT JACKMAN.

18:37.008 --> 18:41.155
IF I WANTED TO EXPOSE YOU,
I COULD HAVE DONE IT
SIX MONTHS AGO

18:41.255 --> 18:43.657
WHEN THAT FILE
FIRST CROSSED MY DESK.

18:43.757 --> 18:45.822
EXPOSED US AS WHAT?

18:45.922 --> 18:47.405
WITCHES.

18:47.505 --> 18:49.822
IT'S THE ONLY
LOGICAL EXPLANATION
FOR ALL THE UNSOLVED CASES,

18:49.922 --> 18:53.379
THE MISSING PERSONS,
THE MYSTERIOUS DEATHS.

18:54.046 --> 18:57.252
PROVE IT.

18:59.502 --> 19:03.151
Paige, on tape:
SOMETHING'S HURTING HER.

19:03.251 --> 19:04.360
Piper, on tape:
SOMETHING IS KILLING HER!

19:04.460 --> 19:06.151
PAIGE, HERE. REVERSAL SPELL.

19:06.251 --> 19:08.360
Both: "RETURN THY LOVE,
WHEREVER SHE BE.

19:08.460 --> 19:10.442
THROUGH TIME AND SPACE
BRING HER BACK TO ME."

19:10.542 --> 19:12.776
THAT DOESN'T
PROVE ANYTHING.

19:12.876 --> 19:15.358
NO, BUT IT
IMPLIES EVERYTHING,

19:15.458 --> 19:18.066
ESPECIALLY WHEN COUPLED
WITH THAT FILE.

19:18.166 --> 19:19.899
YOU THINK YOUR NEWSPAPER
WOULDN'T RUN THAT STORY?

19:19.999 --> 19:21.940
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

19:22.040 --> 19:23.439
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
YOUR HELP.

19:23.539 --> 19:26.065
SEE, I SPECIALIZE IN
OCCULT-STYLE SLAYINGS.

19:26.165 --> 19:29.064
THAT'S WHY
I WAS WATCHING YOU

19:29.164 --> 19:30.355
IN HOPES OF CATCHING
A SERIAL KILLER,

19:30.455 --> 19:31.812
A--A WITCH HUNTER.

19:31.912 --> 19:34.063
ALL RIGHT.
I'VE HEARD ENOUGH
OF THIS NONSENSE.

19:34.163 --> 19:37.561
UH, WAIT A SECOND.
HE FROZE BEFORE.

19:37.661 --> 19:41.142
THIS TIME
I WAS PREPARED.

19:41.242 --> 19:44.477
LIKE I SAID,
I SPECIALIZE
IN THIS STUFF.

19:44.577 --> 19:48.141
THERE'S SUPPOSED
TO BE ONLY A FEW

19:48.241 --> 19:50.140
OF THESE AMULETS
LEFT IN THE WORLD.

19:50.240 --> 19:51.992
GOT THIS ONE
OFF THE WITCH HUNTER
WE'RE AFTER.

19:54.907 --> 19:58.139
HER NAME IS SELENA.

19:58.239 --> 19:59.776
I TRACED HER GENEALOGY
ALL THE WAY BACK
TO THE WITCH TRIALS.

19:59.786 --> 20:02.973
I THINK
KILLING YOU PEOPLE
IS IN HER BLOOD.

20:03.073 --> 20:06.056
IT'S WHAT SHE LIVES FOR.

20:06.156 --> 20:07.232
I MEAN, WHY ELSE
WOULD SHE HAVE BURNED

20:07.242 --> 20:08.137
HER LAST 3 VICTIMS
AT THE STAKE?

20:08.237 --> 20:10.971
WHY ARE YOU
TELLING US THIS?

20:11.071 --> 20:12.607
WELL, BECAUSE I THOUGHT
YOU WERE GONNA BE
HER NEXT VICTIMS,

20:12.617 --> 20:15.428
BUT NOW THAT I KNOW
WHO YOU REALLY ARE
AND WHAT YOU CAN DO,

20:15.528 --> 20:18.135
I NEED YOU
TO HELP ME FIND HER
BEFORE SHE KILLS AGAIN.

20:18.235 --> 20:20.218
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE SHE IS?

20:20.318 --> 20:22.234
I DID FOR A WHILE.
HAD HER IN CUSTODY ONCE,
BUT, UH, SHE GOT AWAY.

20:23.026 --> 20:26.133
MM-HMM.

20:26.233 --> 20:27.275
THESE ARE
SOME OF SELENA'S
PERSONAL BELONGINGS.

20:29.232 --> 20:32.091
NOW, FROM WHAT I KNOW,
IF YOU USE YOUR POWERS
ON THEM,

20:32.191 --> 20:34.966
YOU MIGHT BE
ABLE TO FIND HER.
NOW, YOU DO THAT,

20:35.066 --> 20:37.298
I'LL MAKE SURE
THOSE FILES
DISAPPEAR FOREVER.

20:37.398 --> 20:39.690
YOU DON'T?
WELL, YOU FIGURE IT OUT.

20:41.229 --> 20:44.397
CALL ME.

20:47.396 --> 20:50.754
I DON'T TRUST HIM.

20:50.854 --> 20:52.127
GEE, YA THINK?

20:52.227 --> 20:53.712
MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE
THE ANGEL OF DESTINY
UP ON HIS OFFER.

20:53.812 --> 20:56.252
GREAT. SO WE'D BE FREE
AND SO IS SELENA,

20:56.352 --> 20:58.461
WHO, FOR ALL WE KNOW,
COULD BE A WARLOCK.

20:58.561 --> 21:00.044
NO, WARLOCKS
DON'T BURN WITCHES
AT THE STAKE.

21:00.144 --> 21:02.168
THEY JUST
STEAL THEIR POWERS.

21:02.268 --> 21:03.293
EXACTLY. POWERS, PHOEBE.

21:03.393 --> 21:05.043
THE VERY THINGS
WE WERE GIVEN TO DO GOOD WITH.

21:05.143 --> 21:07.124
REMEMBER?

21:07.224 --> 21:08.458
[CHUCKLES]
YEAH, PAIGE.
I REMEMBER.

21:08.558 --> 21:11.875
Piper: GUYS.

21:11.975 --> 21:13.122
DO YOU REALLY,

21:13.222 --> 21:14.122
OR HAS
ALL THAT DARK MAGIC

21:14.222 --> 21:15.707
JUST KINDA GOTTEN
INTO YOUR BRAIN?

21:15.807 --> 21:17.122
OH. G-GUYS.

21:17.222 --> 21:19.372
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE SO WILLING

21:19.472 --> 21:20.372
TO JUST THROW AWAY
OUR POWERS.

21:20.472 --> 21:21.372
PAIGE, YOU DON'T KNOW
THE HELL

21:21.472 --> 21:22.538
THAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH.

21:22.638 --> 21:24.120
YOU DIDN'T LIVE IT.

21:24.220 --> 21:25.258
OH, REALLY? I WAS JUST
TURNED INTO A VAMPIRE,

21:25.268 --> 21:27.162
AND THEN I WAS SHRUNK,
AND THEN WE SWITCHED
BODIES, AND--

21:27.262 --> 21:30.621
OK, IMAGINE GOING
THROUGH THAT FOR YEARS.

21:30.721 --> 21:33.745
ALL I'M ASKING
IS FOR MY LIFE BACK.

21:33.845 --> 21:35.411
OK, GUYS. ENOUGH.
WE NEED TO FOCUS.

21:35.511 --> 21:38.619
WHAT ABOUT YOU, PIPER?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

21:38.719 --> 21:41.492
I THINK WE NEED
TO SEE THIS THROUGH

21:41.592 --> 21:44.451
LIKE THE ANGEL
SUGGESTED.

21:44.551 --> 21:46.158
SO, PAIGE...

21:46.258 --> 21:47.675
YOU ARE GONNA
GO UP TO THE ATTIC

21:49.633 --> 21:51.114
AND GET STARTED
ON THIS STUFF.

21:51.214 --> 21:52.616
WE WILL MEET YOU
THERE. SCOOT.

21:52.716 --> 21:55.173
LEO, YOU CAN ORB.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

21:56.798 --> 22:00.112
WHAT ABOUT
THE FBI AGENT?

22:00.212 --> 22:01.488
UH, HE ALREADY BUSTED US,

22:01.588 --> 22:03.363
BUT SUPPOSEDLY,
ALL HE WANTS IS OUR HELP.

22:03.463 --> 22:06.654
DID YOU FIND ANYTHING OUT
ABOUT THE ANGEL OF DESTINY?

22:06.754 --> 22:08.695
HE'S LEGIT
AND SO IS HIS OFFER.

22:08.795 --> 22:12.153
OK, UM, CAN YOU
DO US A FAVOR

22:12.253 --> 22:15.109
AND GO GET DARRYL
AND MAKE SURE

22:15.209 --> 22:16.986
THAT AGENT JACKMAN
IS LEGIT, TOO,

22:17.086 --> 22:19.776
AND MEANWHILE, WE HAVE
A WITCH HUNTER TO FIND.

22:19.876 --> 22:22.207
DON'T ASK. JUST GO.

22:23.207 --> 22:23.834

23:12.615 --> 23:14.989

"BEFORE THE FLAME

DRIP ONTO

24:05.812 --> 24:09.084
AIN'T MAGIC GRAND?

24:09.184 --> 24:11.085
Phoebe: OK, BYE.

24:11.185 --> 24:13.501
THAT WAS MORRIS.
HE CONFIRMED

24:13.601 --> 24:16.083
THAT THERE IS A SERIAL
KILLER ON THE LOOSE

24:16.183 --> 24:17.709
DOING EXACTLY
WHAT JACKMAN SAID.

24:17.809 --> 24:20.001
WE'RE ALL OVER IT.

24:20.101 --> 24:21.417
HE ALSO SAID
THAT JACKMAN HAS

24:21.517 --> 24:22.624
MORE INFORMATION ON US
THAN HE SHARED,

24:22.724 --> 24:25.041
INCLUDING OUR GENEALOGY

24:25.141 --> 24:27.582
DATING ALL THE WAY BACK
TO MELINDA WARREN.

24:27.682 --> 24:30.748
WELL, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

24:30.848 --> 24:32.039
THEY'RE GONNA
KEEP CHECKING.

24:32.139 --> 24:33.581
IT MEANS HE'S GONE
THROUGH AN AWFUL
LOT OF TROUBLE

24:33.681 --> 24:35.079
TO GET AS MUCH
INFORMATION ON US
AS POSSIBLE.

24:35.179 --> 24:38.496
I GOT A BAD FEELING
HE'S NOT GONNA

24:38.596 --> 24:40.078
LET US OFF THE HOOK
SO EASILY AFTER THIS
IS ALL OVER.

24:40.178 --> 24:42.870
WHAT, HE'S JUST
GONNA KEEP USING US
AFTERWARDS?

24:42.970 --> 24:45.703
GREAT. CHARLIE'S
FREAKIN' ANGELS.

24:45.803 --> 24:48.386
THIS JUST KEEPS GETTIN'
BETTER AND BETTER.

24:48.552 --> 24:49.927
GOT SELENA. DO WE STILL
GO AFTER HER?

24:52.218 --> 24:55.074
WELL, WE DON'T
HAVE A CHOICE.

24:55.174 --> 24:58.034
WE CAN'T LET
HER RUN AROUND

24:58.134 --> 24:59.257
BURNING PEOPLE
AT THE STAKE.

25:18.754 --> 25:22.461
SHE HAS BODYGUARDS.
LOTS OF BODYGUARDS.

25:22.670 --> 25:26.402
I WONDER WHY JACKMAN
DIDN'T TELL US ABOUT THEM.

25:26.502 --> 25:29.044
PROBABLY FIGURED
WE WOULDN'T HELP
IF WE KNEW.

25:29.167 --> 25:32.192
AAH!
OH!

25:32.292 --> 25:33.859
AAH!

25:33.959 --> 25:35.833

NOT HAVE THE SENSE

25:36.917 --> 25:39.233
TO SENSE IF ANYBODY ELSE
WAS IN THE ROOM?

25:39.333 --> 25:40.899
BEFORE YOU
ORBED US IN HERE?

25:40.999 --> 25:43.164
AAH!

25:45.456 --> 25:48.606
COME ON.

25:48.706 --> 25:51.039
GOING SOMEWHERE?

25:54.038 --> 25:57.646
WE'RE GONNA NEED
SOME SERIOUS MEMORY DUST

25:57.746 --> 25:59.060
AFTER ALL THIS IS OVER.

25:59.160 --> 26:00.270
YEAH, WELL, WE
GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE.

26:00.370 --> 26:02.495
PHOEBE.

26:03.452 --> 26:05.159
COLE.

26:08.409 --> 26:12.077
I SWEAR
HE WAS JUST THERE.

26:14.034 --> 26:14.575
AAH!

26:17.156 --> 26:18.491
COME ON! ORB! ORB! ORB!

26:21.407 --> 26:24.598
[KNOCKING]

26:24.698 --> 26:26.155
[KNOCKS]

26:27.656 --> 26:28.639
WHERE IS SHE?

26:28.739 --> 26:29.847
IN THERE.

26:29.947 --> 26:31.263
WHOA, WHOA!
YOU DON'T NEED THAT.

26:31.363 --> 26:33.196
SHE'S UNCONSCIOUS.

26:34.738 --> 26:37.720
SHE PUT UP
MUCH OF A FIGHT?

26:37.820 --> 26:38.887
NO, BUT
HER BODYGUARDS DID.

26:38.987 --> 26:41.051
BODYGUARDS?
SHE HAD BODYGUARDS?

26:41.151 --> 26:42.928
YEAH, LOTS OF 'EM
WITH LOTS OF GUNS,

26:43.028 --> 26:45.050
AND THEY WEREN'T SHY
ABOUT USING THEM, EITHER.

26:45.150 --> 26:47.176
AH. MUST HAVE KNOWN
WE WERE CLOSING IN ON HER.

26:47.276 --> 26:49.175
STILL, DON'T YOU
THINK IT'S ODD

26:49.275 --> 26:51.175
THAT A SERIAL KILLER
HAS HIRED GUNS
PROTECTING HER?

26:51.275 --> 26:53.734
WELL, MAYBE SHE'S
NOT WORKING ALONE.

26:53.983 --> 26:56.232
OR MAYBE YOU'RE JUST
NOT TELLING US EVERYTHING.

26:57.816 --> 27:00.423
MAYBE I'M NOT.

27:00.523 --> 27:02.757
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
DO ABOUT IT?

27:02.857 --> 27:04.142
WELL, FOR ONE THING,
WE'RE NOT GONNA
LET YOU TAKE HER

27:04.152 --> 27:06.356
WITHOUT A WARRANT.

27:07.730 --> 27:11.129
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE ALL THE SAME.

27:11.229 --> 27:14.254
YOU THINK THAT JUST BECAUSE
YOU HAVE GIFTS, POWERS,

27:14.354 --> 27:17.043
THAT YOU'RE ABOVE IT ALL,
YOU'RE SPECIAL.

27:17.143 --> 27:18.836
WELL, I KNOW DIFFERENT.

27:18.936 --> 27:19.962
OH, REALLY?

27:20.062 --> 27:20.962
YEAH. YOUR ARROGANCE

27:21.062 --> 27:22.669
IS YOUR ACHILLES HEEL.

27:22.769 --> 27:23.752
THAT'S WHY WITCH HUNTERS
AND DEMONS

27:23.852 --> 27:25.042
ARE ALWAYS AFTER YOU
AND THEY ALWAYS WILL BE.

27:25.142 --> 27:27.768
I WOULDN'T TRADE PLACES
WITH YOU FOR THE WORLD.

27:28.101 --> 27:30.060
NOW, UM...

27:31.141 --> 27:34.040
HERE'S YOUR WARRANT.

27:34.140 --> 27:35.374
SO WHEN DO WE
GET OUR FILES?

27:35.474 --> 27:37.749
WHEN SHE'S IN JAIL
AND I FEEL I'M SAFE.

27:37.849 --> 27:39.957
TCH. SAFE FROM WHAT?

27:40.057 --> 27:41.473
SAFE FROM YOU.

27:43.306 --> 27:47.037
I DON'T WANNA BE
ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE

27:47.137 --> 27:48.430
WHO MYSTERIOUSLY DISAPPEAR
AROUND HERE.

27:49.679 --> 27:50.971
I KNEW HE'D NEVER
GIVE UP THOSE FILES.

27:53.346 --> 27:55.787
IN CASE ANYBODY
IS WONDERING,

27:55.887 --> 27:57.161
WE ARE
OFFICIALLY SCREWED.

27:57.261 --> 27:59.869
NOT NECESSARILY.

27:59.969 --> 28:01.134
NO! WE ARE NOT
GIVING UP OUR POWERS.

28:02.177 --> 28:04.133
PAIGE, I DON'T WANNA
GIVE UP OUR POWERS, EITHER,

28:06.133 --> 28:08.825
BUT I DON'T WANNA GIVE UP
OUR LIVES EVEN MORE.

28:08.925 --> 28:11.200
HE'S JUST
GONNA KEEP USING US.

28:11.300 --> 28:15.091
UNLESS WE LET THE ANGEL
WIPE THE SLATE CLEAN.

28:16.091 --> 28:17.798
LOOK, PAIGE, WE SAID
WE WOULD WAIT TO DECIDE

28:19.882 --> 28:23.489
UNTIL THIS THING
PLAYED OUT, AND IT HAS,

28:23.589 --> 28:25.947
AND FRANKLY,
IF THE ANGEL
HADN'T MADE THIS OFFER,

28:26.047 --> 28:28.863
I'D PROBABLY
THINK DIFFERENTLY,

28:28.963 --> 28:31.111
AND I'D THINK
LET'S JUST
KEEP FIGHTING, BUT...

28:31.211 --> 28:34.712
I'M TIRED OF FIGHTING,
AND JACKMAN'S RIGHT.

28:34.879 --> 28:38.027
IT IS NEVER-ENDING.

28:38.127 --> 28:39.753
UNLESS WE END IT
OURSELVES.

28:43.960 --> 28:46.943
SO DO WE NEED TO TALK
TO LEO ABOUT THIS FIRST?

28:47.043 --> 28:50.023
NO. IT DOESN'T HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIM.

28:50.123 --> 28:53.732
IT'S JUST US,
AND HE WILL UNDERSTAND.

28:53.832 --> 28:57.290
YOU GUYS ARE ONLY
SEEING THE BAD.

28:57.498 --> 29:01.189
WHAT ABOUT ALL THE WONDER
OF BEING WITCHES?

29:01.289 --> 29:03.063
THE STUFF YOU INTRODUCED ME
TO IN THE FIRST PLACE?

29:03.163 --> 29:06.020
YOU'RE GONNA
LET ALL OF THAT GO?

29:06.120 --> 29:07.288
PAIGE, IT DOESN'T
BALANCE OUT ANYMORE,

29:07.495 --> 29:11.245
AND AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT WE'VE LOST...

29:12.870 --> 29:16.144
IT DOESN'T SEEM WORTH IT.

29:16.244 --> 29:18.036
WHAT ABOUT ALL THE--
ALL THE GOOD WE'VE DONE?

29:19.952 --> 29:22.184
DOESN'T THAT COUNT
FOR ANYTHING?

29:22.284 --> 29:24.016
OF COURSE IT DOES,
BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHY

29:24.116 --> 29:26.141
WE HAVE THIS CHOICE
TO MAKE.

29:26.241 --> 29:27.700
HE SAID WE FULFILLED OUR
DESTINY. WE'VE DONE IT.

29:28.950 --> 29:30.241
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
OUR REWARD FOR THAT.

29:32.699 --> 29:35.389
YEAH? WELL, PARDON ME

29:35.489 --> 29:38.515
IF IT DOESN'T SEEM
LIKE MUCH OF A REWARD.

29:38.615 --> 29:40.931
BECAUSE...

29:41.031 --> 29:42.597
WITHOUT BEING WITCHES,

29:42.697 --> 29:46.071
I WOULDN'T HAVE SISTERS.

29:53.611 --> 29:57.009
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

29:57.109 --> 29:59.008
YEAH.

29:59.108 --> 30:01.108
AS SURE AS WE'RE
EVER GONNA BE.

30:02.817 --> 30:05.175
YOU UNDERSTAND
THIS DECISION IS FINAL?

30:05.275 --> 30:07.841
THERE WILL BE
NO CHANGING YOUR MINDS.

30:07.941 --> 30:09.925
WE UNDERSTAND.

30:10.025 --> 30:12.356
VERY WELL.

30:16.856 --> 30:20.004
HOLD IT.

30:20.104 --> 30:21.004
JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR,

30:21.104 --> 30:23.254
THIS WIPES
THE ENTIRE SLATE CLEAN.

30:23.354 --> 30:25.087
NO "READ THE FINE PRINT"
TECHNICALITIES.

30:25.187 --> 30:27.045
NO MORE DEMONS. NO MORE
VENGEFUL WARLOCKS.

30:27.145 --> 30:29.003
AND WE WON'T
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
AGENT JACKMAN ANYMORE

30:29.103 --> 30:32.085
OR ANYONE ELSE WHO
MIGHT HAVE FOUND OUT
WE WERE WITCHES?

30:32.185 --> 30:34.211
EXACTLY. JUST FREE
TO LEAD NORMAL LIVES

30:34.311 --> 30:37.000
WITH NO DEMONIC
AFTERTASTE.

30:37.100 --> 30:39.019
ABSOLUTELY.

30:39.642 --> 30:40.726
WILL WE REMEMBER?

30:43.099 --> 30:44.933
BEING WITCHES,
THAT IS?

30:47.098 --> 30:50.582
AH, YOU'LL REMEMBER
EVERYTHING.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.916
THIS DOESN'T
CHANGE YOUR HISTORY.

30:53.016 --> 30:55.664
ONLY YOUR FUTURE.

30:55.764 --> 30:57.623
AND WHAT ABOUT
THE BOOK?

30:57.723 --> 31:00.972
IT WILL PASS
TO SOME FUTURE DESCENDENT.

31:01.763 --> 31:03.596
WHAT ABOUT COLE?

31:05.094 --> 31:07.037
WILL HE KEEP
TRYING TO MAKE
CONTACT WITH ME?

31:07.137 --> 31:09.661
I DON'T KNOW. I HAVE
NO CONTROL OVER THAT.

31:09.761 --> 31:12.285
HE EXISTS BEYOND
TIME AND SPACE,

31:12.385 --> 31:15.452
OUTSIDE DESTINY'S REACH.

31:15.552 --> 31:18.091
WHAT IS IT?

31:19.426 --> 31:20.634
IT'S JUST THAT
HE'S STILL HOLDING ON.

31:23.216 --> 31:26.908
THAT'S WHY
HE APPEARED TO ME.

31:27.008 --> 31:28.989
SO MAYBE IF
I COULD TELL HIM

31:29.089 --> 31:31.823
THAT I DON'T HAVE
THE POWER TO SAVE HIM,

31:31.923 --> 31:34.698
THEN HE'LL BE ABLE
TO MOVE ON FOR GOOD.

31:34.798 --> 31:37.572
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA

31:37.672 --> 31:39.987
CONSIDERING
WHAT HAPPENED LAST TIME.

31:40.087 --> 31:42.086
I CAN'T LEAVE IT
LIKE THIS.

31:43.296 --> 31:46.962
I OWE HIM
MORE THAN THAT.

32:01.625 --> 32:04.733
COLE.

32:04.833 --> 32:06.457
I HAVE
TO TALK TO YOU,

32:08.080 --> 32:09.123
BUT I DON'T
HAVE A LOT OF TIME.

32:09.415 --> 32:10.623
DID YOU SEE ME
COME TO YOU?

32:13.079 --> 32:14.079
YES, I DID.
HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

32:14.247 --> 32:17.521
IT'S A SECRET.

32:17.621 --> 32:19.204
I'M GIVING UP
MY POWERS.

32:21.078 --> 32:22.203
WE ALL ARE.

32:22.662 --> 32:24.328
WHAT?

32:25.869 --> 32:26.811
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO EXPLAIN,

32:26.911 --> 32:28.311
BUT IT'S TRUE,
WHICH MEANS--

32:28.411 --> 32:30.518
I KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.

32:30.618 --> 32:32.076
COLE.

32:33.118 --> 32:35.117
WE DID
THE BEST WE COULD.

32:36.742 --> 32:38.601
WE TRIED
EVERY WAY POSSIBLE
TO MAKE THIS WORK,

32:38.701 --> 32:41.933
BUT...

32:42.033 --> 32:44.640
IT WASN'T
MEANT TO BE...

32:44.740 --> 32:46.490
AND IT WASN'T
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T
LOVE EACH OTHER.

32:48.532 --> 32:51.948
IT'S JUST, UH...

32:52.698 --> 32:53.697
LOVE WASN'T ENOUGH.

32:56.070 --> 32:57.904
SO NOW, WE--
WE HAVE TO MOVE ON,
OK, THE BOTH OF US.

33:06.236 --> 33:09.677
YOU'D BETTER GO...

33:09.777 --> 33:13.066
BEFORE THE BEAST ATTACKS.

33:50.058 --> 33:53.000
[GASPS]

33:53.100 --> 33:55.308
ARE YOU OK?

33:56.392 --> 33:57.766
YEAH.

33:59.599 --> 34:01.416
LET'S DO THIS.

34:01.516 --> 34:02.998
UH, WELL, WE'VE BEEN
THINKING A LITTLE BIT.

34:03.098 --> 34:05.582
ARE YOU HAVING
SECOND THOUGHTS?

34:05.682 --> 34:07.289
NOT ABOUT THE DECISION,
UNFORTUNATELY.

34:07.389 --> 34:10.539
ABOUT JACKMAN
AND SELENA.

34:10.639 --> 34:12.871
YEAH, A LOT OF THINGS
DON'T ADD UP.

34:12.972 --> 34:14.121
HIS EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE
OF WITCHES,

34:14.221 --> 34:16.454
HOW HE GOT AHOLD
OF THAT AMULET.

34:16.554 --> 34:17.952
THE FACT THAT
HE CAME IN ALONE

34:18.052 --> 34:19.871
TO PICK UP SELENA.

34:19.971 --> 34:21.494
THE BODYGUARDS.

34:21.594 --> 34:22.494
WE JUST WANT
TO MAKE SURE

34:22.594 --> 34:23.786
THAT WE'VE DONE
THE RIGHT THING

34:23.886 --> 34:25.045
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE
TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

34:25.056 --> 34:26.949
OK.

34:27.050 --> 34:29.050
IS THAT OK?

34:30.384 --> 34:31.949
HMM? OH, SURE,
ABSOLUTELY.

34:32.049 --> 34:34.947
FRANKLY, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE BEING

34:35.047 --> 34:36.283
A BIT PREMATURE, ANYWAY.

34:36.382 --> 34:38.199
WELL, THEN,
WHY DIDN'T YOU
SAY SOMETHING?

34:38.299 --> 34:40.699
OH, CAN'T.
FREE WILL AND ALL.

34:40.799 --> 34:43.047
LET ME KNOW
WHEN YOU'RE READY.

34:48.045 --> 34:51.255
SO, NOW WHAT?

34:52.005 --> 34:52.880
LEO?

34:55.043 --> 34:56.254
WE WERE JUST
COMING TO GET YOU.

34:57.628 --> 34:58.903
WHY? WHAT
DID YOU FIND?

34:59.003 --> 35:01.653
ANOTHER GENEALOGY
JACKMAN HAS

35:01.753 --> 35:03.527
BESIDES YOURS.

35:03.627 --> 35:05.038
OH, YEAH, WE KNOW
SELENA'S A DESCENDANT
OF WITCH HUNTERS.

35:05.048 --> 35:08.151
NO, JACKMAN IS.

35:08.251 --> 35:10.234
SELENA IS THE DAUGHTER
OF A WITCH.

35:10.334 --> 35:11.859
WHAT?
WHAT?
WHAT?

35:11.959 --> 35:13.040
SHE IS NOT A SUSPECT.
SHE'S A VICTIM.

35:14.040 --> 35:16.399
THEY HAVE HER
IN A SAFE HOUSE

35:16.499 --> 35:17.566
BECAUSE SOMEBODY'S
TRYING TO KILL HER.

35:17.666 --> 35:18.939
PLEASE TELL ME
WE DIDN'T JUST
HELP A WITCH HUNTER

35:19.039 --> 35:21.064
GET A WITCH.

35:21.164 --> 35:23.606
OH, MY GOD.

35:23.706 --> 35:25.038
OH, MY GOD.

35:26.038 --> 35:28.037
Selena: HELP ME!
SOMEBODY, PLEASE HELP ME!

35:28.664 --> 35:31.936
NO ONE CAN HEAR YOU.

35:32.036 --> 35:33.354
NOT WHERE WE ARE.

35:33.454 --> 35:34.978
PLEASE, DON'T.

35:35.078 --> 35:36.935
[CRYING] NO.

35:37.035 --> 35:38.353
AH, BUT I MUST.

35:38.453 --> 35:39.894
NO. OH, GOD.

35:39.994 --> 35:41.269
YOU SEE, IT'S MY DUTY.

35:41.369 --> 35:44.393
IT'S WHAT
I WAS BORN TO DO.

35:44.493 --> 35:47.226
IT'S WHAT I WILL
CONTINUE TO DO

35:47.326 --> 35:49.825
UNTIL EVERY LAST ONE
OF YOU IS DEAD.

35:50.450 --> 35:54.407
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
GET AWAY FROM ME
THIS TIME, WITCH.

35:57.031 --> 35:58.114
HELP! HELP.

36:04.531 --> 36:07.928
YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE.

36:08.028 --> 36:08.928
I SWEAR, I'M NOT A WITCH.

36:09.028 --> 36:10.721
OF COURSE YOU ARE,
SELENA.

36:10.821 --> 36:12.637
IT'S IN YOUR BLOOD.

36:12.737 --> 36:14.303
YOU MOTHER WAS.
THAT MAKES YOU ONE, TOO.

36:14.403 --> 36:16.261
PLEASE,
I'M BEGGING YOU.

36:16.361 --> 36:18.553
YOU KNOW WHY THEY
BURNED WITCHES
AT THE STAKE

36:18.653 --> 36:20.010
400 YEARS AGO?

36:20.110 --> 36:22.093
SO THEY WOULD BURN FOREVER
IN ETERNAL FIRE.

36:22.193 --> 36:25.092
THEY USED GREEN WOOD, TOO.

36:25.192 --> 36:27.467
MADE IT LAST LONGER.

36:27.567 --> 36:29.526
PROLONGED THE AGONY.

36:30.816 --> 36:31.816
DON'T. HELP!

36:37.148 --> 36:40.921
COME TO SAVE
YOUR SISTER WITCH,
HAVE YOU?

36:41.021 --> 36:43.730
ACTUALLY, YEAH.

36:44.230 --> 36:45.230
UM...

36:47.438 --> 36:48.754
YOU SEE,
I BURIED THE REST
OF THE AMULETS

36:48.854 --> 36:49.919
AROUND HERE

36:50.019 --> 36:51.015
IN ANTICIPATION
OF YOUR ARRIVAL.

36:51.025 --> 36:52.837
YOUR POWERS
ARE USELESS HERE.

36:52.937 --> 36:55.628
HOWEVER...

36:55.728 --> 36:56.837
[GASPS]

36:56.937 --> 36:57.836
MINE AREN'T.

36:57.936 --> 36:58.917
UH-UH! MOVE,
AND SHE DIES.

36:59.017 --> 37:01.001
THAT WAS HIS PLAN
ALL ALONG.

37:01.101 --> 37:03.084
HE WAS GONNA
KILL US ANYWAY.

37:03.184 --> 37:04.751
OUCH!

37:04.851 --> 37:05.916

HOW--HOW ARE YOU...

38:44.662 --> 38:46.312

38:46.412 --> 38:47.437
LET'S JUST SAY
I PICKED UP A--

38:47.537 --> 38:49.770
A FEW POWERS LATELY.

38:49.870 --> 38:52.619
QUITE A FEW,
ACTUALLY.

39:00.991 --> 39:04.558
I'M NOT GIVING UP

39:27.985 --> 39:28.985
YOU'RE
GONNA BE OK.

39:52.979 --> 39:56.214
WHERE'S PAIGE?

39:56.314 --> 39:57.338
OH, SHE HAD TO PARK
DOWN THE STREET

39:57.438 --> 39:58.962
BECAUSE THE DRIVEWAY
WAS BLOCKED.

39:59.062 --> 40:01.754
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
I'LL GO TALK TO THEM
AND TELL THEM TO MOVE.

40:01.854 --> 40:03.337
OH, NO, IT'S
NOT A BIG DEAL.

40:03.437 --> 40:04.877
AND TO THINK,
24 HOURS AGO

40:04.977 --> 40:06.586
THAT WAS
OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM.

EVERYTHING SO FAR.

40:15.974 --> 40:17.209
THEY'RE STUMPED.

40:17.309 --> 40:18.874

HOW HE SHOT HIMSELF
FROM 20 FEET AWAY.

THEY'D BE GRATEFUL.

40:26.972 --> 40:28.332

ONE WOULD HOPE.

40:28.432 --> 40:29.871

UNTIL THEY FIND
THOSE FILES ON US.

A LITTLE TASTE

OF WHAT LIFE
WOULD BE LIKE

41:37.957 --> 41:39.149
WITHOUT MY POWERS,

41:39.249 --> 41:40.499
