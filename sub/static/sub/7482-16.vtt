WEBVTT

00:11.659 --> 00:14.526
Step on it, Mateo. He's gonna be mad.

00:16.731 --> 00:18.563
Nina, where you been?
What the hell happened?

00:18.733 --> 00:21.498
The plane was two hours late.
Big storm off Costa Rica.

00:21.669 --> 00:24.366
Doors open in five minutes.
You're costing me money.

00:26.174 --> 00:27.300
Got it, jefe.

00:30.912 --> 00:33.313
It's always our fault, right?

00:33.481 --> 00:34.915
Always.

00:46.928 --> 00:48.828
Ah. Excuse me.

01:33.474 --> 01:38.036
Come on, Betsy. Oh, sweet baby.

01:38.279 --> 01:41.044
You look so cuddly.

01:47.889 --> 01:49.529
What's up, Deeks?
You going on a ski trip?

01:49.891 --> 01:52.891
No, man, I'm just trying to stay toasty.
We got a lot of winter ahead of us.

01:53.027 --> 01:54.722
- Oh, yeah?
- In case you haven't heard,

01:54.896 --> 01:57.388
couple weeks ago,
the groundhog saw its shadow.

01:57.799 --> 02:00.080
Groundhog. You get your weather
forecast from a groundhog?

02:00.235 --> 02:02.035
Where you get your financial advice?
Squirrel?

02:02.203 --> 02:03.898
No, because that would be nuts.

02:04.072 --> 02:07.736
Ha, ha. You see how quick that was
when I said "nuts"? That's a... No?

02:07.909 --> 02:10.139
Yeah, I get it. Nuts is right.

02:10.945 --> 02:12.071
Really, Deeks?

02:12.280 --> 02:15.079
Temperature drops into the 50s,
everyone starts walking around town

02:15.250 --> 02:16.877
with a down jacket
and nose warmers on.

02:17.352 --> 02:18.717
L.A. breeds weather wimps.

02:18.886 --> 02:22.254
No, I can handle the cold, man.
Try surfing Mavericks in a one-mil suit.

02:22.423 --> 02:25.290
Try bivouacking the Serbian Alps
in a blizzard.

02:25.460 --> 02:27.326
Tracking down Russian mobsters
in Yakutsk,

02:27.495 --> 02:29.429
where the January high is 34 below.

02:29.597 --> 02:30.758
- Yakutsk?
- Mm-hm.

02:30.932 --> 02:33.867
All right, fair enough. I admit defeat.
You guys have the biggest icicles.

02:42.110 --> 02:44.078
It's left over
from my Presidents' Day party.

02:44.412 --> 02:47.074
I bet that was quite the shindig.

02:47.248 --> 02:50.878
Well, we really are alone here.

02:56.758 --> 02:59.557
Three a.m., the wholesale fish market
down at the harbor.

03:02.030 --> 03:03.862
Yeah. The bomb blast killed two:

03:04.032 --> 03:07.366
Eduardo Barajas
and Young Jae Kim.

03:07.535 --> 03:10.334
- Looks like it could've been worse.
- Who targets a fish market?

03:10.505 --> 03:12.098
Militant vegans?

03:12.273 --> 03:14.401
FBI and L.A.P.D.
are currently on the scene,

03:14.575 --> 03:16.134
but Hetty wants us down there

03:16.311 --> 03:18.803
to see if this was just
an isolated domestic incident

03:18.980 --> 03:21.347
or the beginnings
of an international threat.

03:21.516 --> 03:23.780
Keep your mittens on, Deeks.
You're coming with us.

03:23.951 --> 03:26.249
- They're fingerless gloves.
- Isn't that an oxymoron?

03:26.421 --> 03:28.913
- If the glove fits...
- Ha, ha.

03:37.031 --> 03:39.227
Watch your back, coming through.

03:44.339 --> 03:48.401
My son had a gentle soul,

03:48.609 --> 03:50.373
like his mother.

03:52.280 --> 03:55.477
Did you see anything suspicious
before the blast, sir?

03:55.650 --> 03:56.845
No.

03:57.185 --> 03:58.584
Nothing.

03:58.753 --> 04:00.517
Business as usual.

04:01.556 --> 04:06.118
Have you or your son had any conflicts
with any workers or other vendors?

04:06.294 --> 04:08.285
We're all like a family here.

04:09.364 --> 04:10.661
Originally from Korea?

04:11.232 --> 04:13.701
Yes. Why?

04:15.303 --> 04:18.204
Have either of you traveled
to North Korea in the past year?

04:18.839 --> 04:19.863
No.

04:20.041 --> 04:21.940
No family there?

04:22.710 --> 04:25.407
I have two sisters in Seoul.

04:26.681 --> 04:28.740
I should go now.

04:28.916 --> 04:31.578
My daughter-in-law
and grandchildren,

04:32.086 --> 04:33.918
- they need me now.
- Of course.

04:34.088 --> 04:35.487
Thank you.

04:35.656 --> 04:36.987
I'm very sorry for your loss.

04:44.165 --> 04:46.532
Nothing useful out of the father.

04:46.701 --> 04:49.136
Bomb squad confirmed
it was a pressure cooker.

04:49.303 --> 04:50.600
That's just like Boston.

04:51.105 --> 04:52.732
Probably got the recipe
off the Internet.

04:52.907 --> 04:54.341
Gunpowder, blasting cap.

04:55.176 --> 04:57.543
But only a small amount
of nails and screws for shrapnel.

04:58.846 --> 05:00.886
Lucky for us, they didn't know
what they were doing.

05:02.216 --> 05:03.342
What are you thinking?

05:03.518 --> 05:07.352
Just seems weird,
this location, the device.

05:07.522 --> 05:09.889
You think test or specific target?

05:11.759 --> 05:13.352
- I don't know.
- Checked the office.

05:13.528 --> 05:14.728
Somebody covered their tracks.

05:14.896 --> 05:16.496
The security-camera hard drive
was erased

05:16.664 --> 05:18.428
from 1 a.m. until 2:45 a.m.

05:18.599 --> 05:20.363
So we see the explosion...

05:20.535 --> 05:22.196
But we don't see
who placed the backpack.

05:22.370 --> 05:26.102
- Did you find anything else?
- Thought I did. Turned out to be this.

05:26.274 --> 05:28.038
- What is that?
- Don't ask.

05:28.209 --> 05:30.337
- He's gotta know.
- Deeks, I'm warning you.

05:30.511 --> 05:31.569
Trust me. Walk away.

05:32.113 --> 05:33.137
It's a red herring.

05:33.314 --> 05:34.907
Oh. Pfft.

05:35.082 --> 05:37.449
Come on, man.
This is an actual red herring.

05:37.618 --> 05:39.245
- Don't encourage him.
- I'm not.

05:39.420 --> 05:42.287
- I told you that I work here, right?
- This is a crime scene.

05:42.457 --> 05:43.817
Where's Eduardo? Where's the body?

05:43.958 --> 05:46.256
Stay back or you will be arrested.

05:46.427 --> 05:47.451
- Okay.
- Thank you.

05:47.628 --> 05:48.652
All right.

05:50.965 --> 05:52.160
- Ma'am.
- Who else died?

05:52.333 --> 05:53.767
- I have friends in there.
- Easy.

05:53.935 --> 05:56.370
- Just let go of me.
- Hey, take it easy.

05:56.537 --> 05:57.971
You just assaulted a federal agent.

05:58.372 --> 06:00.170
I am a federal agent.

06:00.341 --> 06:02.036
Undercover DEA.

06:02.210 --> 06:03.302
We have to talk.

06:04.579 --> 06:06.343
Officer, we got it from here.

06:10.184 --> 06:12.278
One of the men who was killed,

06:12.453 --> 06:15.650
Eduardo Barajas,
he imported fish from Ecuador.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.192
I think somebody wanted him dead.

06:18.926 --> 06:20.416
Why?

06:22.063 --> 06:23.121
He, uh...

06:23.297 --> 06:24.321
He contacted us

06:24.499 --> 06:27.696
because he was suspicious
of one of his new employees.

06:27.869 --> 06:30.964
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Um...

06:31.973 --> 06:34.601
The guy's name was Mateo.

06:35.243 --> 06:36.711
Does Mateo have a last name?

06:38.312 --> 06:40.303
Nina. Whoa.

06:40.481 --> 06:42.142
Watch her head.

06:42.984 --> 06:44.008
She's barely breathing.

06:44.185 --> 06:45.983
- Call for a paramedic.
- Guys, move it.

06:46.153 --> 06:47.382
Come on, Nina, wake up.

06:48.256 --> 06:51.317
- Nina, come on.
- She's shocky. Elevate her legs.

06:55.897 --> 06:58.229
- Got something here.
- What?

06:59.033 --> 07:00.558
Fresh puncture wounds.

07:06.407 --> 07:08.501
There's fragments in the skin.

07:09.644 --> 07:12.011
They're hard and sharp.

07:12.179 --> 07:13.578
Oh, what is that?

07:13.748 --> 07:16.012
That is a dorsal spine from a stonefish.

07:16.417 --> 07:18.417
Deeks, get some hot water.
It'll destroy the venom.

07:18.586 --> 07:19.951
On it.

07:21.822 --> 07:24.814
You learn to stay far away
from these when you dive.

07:24.992 --> 07:26.482
How toxic is it?

07:27.662 --> 07:29.426
Another five minutes, she'd be dead.

07:44.944 --> 07:46.537
Confirmed that patient

07:46.713 --> 07:48.545
will not be transported to hospital.

07:49.816 --> 07:50.942
It wasn't an accident.

07:51.117 --> 07:53.245
The spines came in
from the side with force.

07:53.419 --> 07:54.853
And she didn't feel it?

07:55.021 --> 07:56.955
- Somebody wanted to shut her up.
- For good.

07:57.490 --> 07:58.890
She must've been close
to something.

07:59.025 --> 08:02.393
So she's signing herself out, AMA,
refusing further medical treatment.

08:02.562 --> 08:04.155
She's a tough little lady.

08:04.330 --> 08:06.690
Take her back to the boatshed,
find out what else she knows.

08:06.833 --> 08:08.699
We're gonna track down
this Mateo character.

08:09.802 --> 08:10.928
And if she refuses?

08:11.704 --> 08:14.105
- Charm her.
- She'll love it.

08:15.742 --> 08:17.437
- There you go.
- Thank you.

08:18.378 --> 08:21.370
Sure you don't wanna go
to the hospital, Nina?

08:22.148 --> 08:23.912
I'm sure.

08:24.250 --> 08:25.740
Actually, it's Talia.

08:25.918 --> 08:28.012
- Talia Del Campo.
- Marty Deeks.

08:28.187 --> 08:30.485
- Heh.
- Yeah, sorry about the mittens.

08:31.424 --> 08:32.619
I'm sorry about the elbow.

08:33.926 --> 08:34.950
I was undercover.

08:35.128 --> 08:38.029
Couldn't let anybody know I was
cooperating with the investigation.

08:38.197 --> 08:39.917
Somebody tried to kill you.
You almost died.

08:40.066 --> 08:42.159
Sure you don't wanna take a break,
let us take over?

08:42.335 --> 08:45.532
No chance.
This is my case, my collar.

08:45.705 --> 08:48.072
- All right.
- Ugh.

08:48.241 --> 08:49.265
You okay?

08:50.643 --> 08:52.270
Yeah. Unh.

08:52.478 --> 08:54.845
Maybe I should just
stay off my feet for a bit.

08:55.214 --> 08:56.807
Yeah, you're lucky to be alive.

08:58.551 --> 09:00.071
Why weren't you working
with a partner?

09:00.219 --> 09:02.688
Because they just complicate things.

09:04.657 --> 09:05.749
What's your excuse?

09:07.794 --> 09:10.263
I'm a one-man army.

09:13.766 --> 09:17.361
It went down
90 minutes ago, and you can't find it?

09:18.204 --> 09:20.434
What about a rescue team?

09:24.077 --> 09:26.512
You got night vision.
Do your damn job.

09:26.679 --> 09:28.204
Keep searching the area.

09:28.381 --> 09:30.110
What's going on?

09:30.683 --> 09:32.777
We lost a chopper
somewhere in here.

09:34.153 --> 09:35.780
You know this area?

09:35.955 --> 09:37.582
It's where Sabatino ditched me.

09:37.757 --> 09:39.020
You been in contact with him?

09:39.492 --> 09:40.550
No.

09:42.195 --> 09:45.096
Get dressed.
We're heading out at first light.

09:45.698 --> 09:47.166
Yes, sir.

09:49.869 --> 09:51.064
What do we have, guys?

09:51.237 --> 09:53.934
Well, our suspicious driver,
Mateo Orantes,

09:54.107 --> 09:56.201
he has a valid visa from Ecuador.

09:56.375 --> 09:58.867
His passport's also genuine.
Holograms, watermarks, everything.

09:59.045 --> 10:00.069
Where does he live?

10:00.246 --> 10:02.715
He moved out of an apartment
in Van Nuys two weeks ago.

10:02.882 --> 10:04.850
- No forwarding address.
- Isn't that convenient?

10:05.017 --> 10:07.543
All right, keep working on it.
Anything from the fish market?

10:07.720 --> 10:09.449
Uh, good news and bad news.
Deeks was right.

10:09.622 --> 10:12.114
The video surveillance was wiped
leading up to the explosion,

10:12.291 --> 10:13.918
but not the aftermath.

10:14.093 --> 10:16.494
Here's the hallway
from the loading dock.

10:16.662 --> 10:20.155
And here's where the DEA
agent was stabbed with the fish spine.

10:20.333 --> 10:22.392
Suspect's back is to the camera
the whole time.

10:22.568 --> 10:25.003
He's either very smart
or he's very lucky.

10:25.171 --> 10:26.491
You got any other footage of him?

10:26.639 --> 10:28.403
He kind of disappears
for a few minutes.

10:28.574 --> 10:31.874
And then this guy shows up outside
wearing a motorcycle helmet.

10:32.044 --> 10:33.409
He's got the same build,

10:33.579 --> 10:35.479
- the same tennies.
- Who picked him up?

10:35.648 --> 10:38.913
Not sure yet. And I'm still working
on this license plate.

10:40.753 --> 10:43.984
Well,
is this a genuine terrorist threat?

10:44.157 --> 10:47.821
Or another example of the world
going to hell in a handbasket?

10:47.994 --> 10:49.120
It's too soon to tell.

10:49.629 --> 10:51.393
Wonderful.

10:52.031 --> 10:54.363
- Mr. Deeks?
- The boatshed.

10:55.334 --> 10:58.304
Charming our DEA agent, we hope.

10:59.972 --> 11:01.997
These are our suspects?

11:02.175 --> 11:03.540
We think so.

11:03.709 --> 11:06.610
Though, unfortunately,
they remain mystery men at this point.

11:09.348 --> 11:11.282
All right, English breakfast coming up.

11:11.450 --> 11:13.282
So why don't you tell me
what happened?

11:13.452 --> 11:14.942
Everybody was running outside.

11:15.454 --> 11:16.478
It was crazy.

11:16.656 --> 11:18.416
Some guy dropped
a huge ice chest on my foot.

11:18.558 --> 11:19.582
Thanks.

11:19.759 --> 11:21.999
That's probably when you were
attacked by the toxic fish.

11:22.161 --> 11:23.629
I mean, didn't it even hurt?

11:23.796 --> 11:27.061
Not compared to having 50 pounds of
frozen haddock dropped on your toes.

11:27.233 --> 11:28.428
Right.

11:29.168 --> 11:31.660
It stung a bit, but I shook it off.

11:31.837 --> 11:33.032
Because you're a tough guy?

11:34.407 --> 11:36.933
You know,
my leg is cramping a little.

11:37.109 --> 11:40.189
You got any shiatsu skills or anything?
I could use a little deep-tissue work.

11:40.346 --> 11:41.905
You mind?

11:42.715 --> 11:45.810
You want me to do deep-tissue work
on you?

11:47.353 --> 11:48.718
Why don't you, uh...?

11:48.888 --> 11:51.687
Ahem. Why don't you tell me
about the guy that dropped the fish?

11:51.857 --> 11:54.377
I may be able to pick him out of
a lineup, but he was pretty ND.

11:54.527 --> 11:56.325
What about Mateo?

11:56.495 --> 11:58.327
Most of Eduardo's employees
are full-time.

11:58.497 --> 12:00.022
Mateo was a part-time driver.

12:00.199 --> 12:01.428
So why was he so shady?

12:01.601 --> 12:05.162
He only wanted to be paid in cash.
No taxes, no withholding.

12:05.504 --> 12:06.699
Sign me up.

12:08.040 --> 12:09.701
Eduardo wouldn't do it.

12:09.875 --> 12:12.367
He was the president of
the Ecuador-American Business Club.

12:12.979 --> 12:15.949
Always played by the rules.
Nobody got paid off-books.

12:16.249 --> 12:18.274
So then why did they bring in
the DEA?

12:19.952 --> 12:22.580
Mateo was picking up shipments
from the airport.

12:22.755 --> 12:25.122
Boxes were opened
between LAX and the fish market,

12:25.291 --> 12:27.988
with the occasional empty freezer bag
found in the ice.

12:28.160 --> 12:30.925
Those bags tested positive
for cocaine.

12:31.097 --> 12:32.963
Well, Ecuador borders Colombia,

12:33.132 --> 12:35.829
and the smell of fish
can throw off a drug dog.

12:36.402 --> 12:39.064
I've been working Mateo,
gaining his trust.

12:39.238 --> 12:40.865
When's the last time you saw him?

12:41.040 --> 12:43.134
We were both outside for the blast.

12:43.309 --> 12:45.744
And then the next thing I know,
he was gone.

12:46.979 --> 12:49.607
Anyway, I really gotta go.

12:49.782 --> 12:51.910
Uh, no, no, you can't go.

12:52.084 --> 12:53.844
I mean, this is ridiculous.
You can't even...

12:53.953 --> 12:55.387
You can't even walk.

12:55.554 --> 12:57.044
You got attacked by a stonefish.

12:57.890 --> 12:59.085
I gotta pee.

12:59.258 --> 13:00.521
Oh, that was...

13:00.693 --> 13:01.956
All right. Uh, heh.

13:02.128 --> 13:04.153
Sure, right through there
is the bathroom.

13:04.330 --> 13:06.958
Great. Unh. Wow.

13:07.133 --> 13:08.294
Okay. A little help here.

13:08.467 --> 13:11.630
Okay, let's get you a cane,
maybe get you some crutches.

13:11.804 --> 13:13.533
I would settle for a shot of tequila.

13:13.706 --> 13:15.800
Heh, okay.

13:53.212 --> 13:56.045
Definitely looks like an RPG attack.

13:57.383 --> 13:59.215
Who was on board?

13:59.785 --> 14:01.048
Special Forces.

14:01.320 --> 14:03.311
Hard to believe
anybody could've survived this.

14:03.489 --> 14:05.014
Yeah, they didn't.

14:11.731 --> 14:13.971
- Where are the bodies?
- Insurgents must have taken them

14:14.133 --> 14:16.192
along with everything else
they could strip out.

14:16.369 --> 14:19.031
- Bargaining chips?
- With these guys, you never know.

14:19.605 --> 14:21.471
I'll send in the coordinates.

14:22.508 --> 14:24.602
Hey, you getting anywhere
with the motorcycle plate?

14:24.777 --> 14:27.007
Well, far too blurry
for the human eye,

14:27.179 --> 14:29.876
but through the magic
of digital enhancement,

14:30.049 --> 14:33.610
we now know that the motorbike
is registered to one Raul Herrera.

14:33.786 --> 14:37.518
Another Ecuadorian that entered
the country the same week as Mateo.

14:37.690 --> 14:39.250
Think they're playing
for the same team?

14:39.392 --> 14:42.623
- I got an address.
- Well, I'll call it in.

14:54.173 --> 14:56.373
You guys want to come over
for dinner on Saturday night?

14:56.509 --> 14:58.102
Who, me and Deeks?

14:58.711 --> 14:59.735
What?

14:59.912 --> 15:02.244
Don't "what" me.
This is how you're gonna play it?

15:02.415 --> 15:03.940
I don't know
what you're talking about.

15:04.116 --> 15:06.236
Hope you're a better liar
next time we get in trouble.

15:06.385 --> 15:09.286
Your lips are moving, words are
coming out, but they don't make sense.

15:09.455 --> 15:11.583
- It's like you had a stroke.
- Fine.

15:11.757 --> 15:14.727
You can tell me, or Jo can tell my wife,
and then she'll tell me.

15:14.894 --> 15:16.521
Oh, this is about that?

15:16.695 --> 15:18.185
Yeah, this is about that.

15:18.364 --> 15:19.889
Well, that has nothing to do
with this.

15:20.065 --> 15:22.932
- Oh, so it's serious?
- It's not serious. It's just personal.

15:23.102 --> 15:26.367
Ha, ha. So we don't share anymore?

15:26.539 --> 15:28.940
Since when are you interested
in my love life, huh?

15:29.508 --> 15:30.805
Since you started having one.

15:31.377 --> 15:33.903
Excuse me for wanting to keep
some things private, okay?

15:34.079 --> 15:36.571
Some things? You make
Howard Hughes look like an extrovert.

15:36.749 --> 15:40.083
I'm talking long-hair, germophobic,
saving-his-own-urine Hughes.

15:40.252 --> 15:42.880
Hell, you won't even tell me
your first name.

15:43.155 --> 15:45.920
- We done?
- Guess so.

15:46.091 --> 15:49.584
Although I do find it interesting,
you saying "love life" instead of "dating."

15:49.762 --> 15:51.753
Don't get your hopes up,
Martha Stewart.

15:51.931 --> 15:53.956
You won't be planning a wedding
any time soon.

15:54.133 --> 15:55.157
I enjoy being single.

15:55.334 --> 15:57.014
What'll you do
when you get old and lonely?

15:57.169 --> 15:59.369
- Who's gonna take care of you?
- I'll move in with you.

16:00.739 --> 16:02.659
Only if I get Alzheimer's
and forget who you are.

16:02.808 --> 16:05.106
You sure ain't putting your pee jars
in my garage.

16:05.711 --> 16:06.974
Raul Herrera?

16:07.513 --> 16:09.345
We got a runner.

16:10.182 --> 16:11.206
Federal agents!

16:11.383 --> 16:12.863
If you're in here,
show us your hands.

16:18.824 --> 16:19.848
Back door!

16:30.302 --> 16:32.293
Bring the car around.

16:39.311 --> 16:41.473
Sam, you got a bead on him yet?

16:41.647 --> 16:44.344
Copy that.
I'll be heading east on Yucca.

16:56.228 --> 16:58.219
- What?
- I said put your hands on your head.

16:59.798 --> 17:00.890
I don't speak Spanish.

17:02.601 --> 17:04.797
You're from Ecuador,
and you don't speak Spanish?

17:07.339 --> 17:09.637
Bring it in, Sam. I got him.

17:21.385 --> 17:22.944
I've been doing this for a while, Raul.

17:23.119 --> 17:26.112
Most of the time, innocent people
don't hide under beds

17:26.290 --> 17:28.315
unless they're 8 years old.

17:28.826 --> 17:31.426
I owe a guy some money. I thought
you guys were coming to collect.

17:32.129 --> 17:34.188
- Money for what?
- A motorcycle.

17:34.365 --> 17:36.663
The bike you brought
to the fish market this morning?

17:38.302 --> 17:40.566
- What fish market?
- "What fish market?"

17:40.738 --> 17:42.900
We saw you ride off
with a crime suspect.

17:43.074 --> 17:45.372
- My motorcycle was stolen last night.
- Really?

17:45.543 --> 17:47.443
Did you file a police report?

17:47.611 --> 17:50.080
I was about to,
but you guys broke in.

17:50.982 --> 17:53.144
Yeah, uh-huh. Our timing sucks.

17:53.317 --> 17:55.342
You know what I don't understand?

17:55.519 --> 17:59.752
How is it that a guy raised in Ecuador
doesn't speak Spanish?

18:00.691 --> 18:02.250
My father was Ecuadorian.

18:02.693 --> 18:04.933
My mother came from the U.S.
to work for the Peace Corps.

18:05.096 --> 18:07.758
Peace Corps? Now, that's ironic.

18:08.632 --> 18:10.396
When I was 2, my father died.

18:10.568 --> 18:13.469
I grew up speaking English.
I went to an American school in Quito.

18:13.971 --> 18:15.461
What are you doing in L.A.?

18:15.639 --> 18:17.539
Student visa at CSUN.

18:17.708 --> 18:20.973
Uh, but to be honest,
I failed a couple classes,

18:21.145 --> 18:22.544
so just taking the semester off.

18:23.814 --> 18:25.304
We have any police reports
in the car?

18:26.117 --> 18:27.812
I think so.

18:27.985 --> 18:29.350
Stick with us a while.

18:29.520 --> 18:32.683
Good news is you'll have time to fill out
the paperwork for your stolen bike.

18:42.967 --> 18:46.699
Hopefully, Ops can work their magic
with fingerprints and an iris scan.

18:46.871 --> 18:48.396
Yeah.

18:53.244 --> 18:54.734
Any news on our guy Mateo?

18:54.912 --> 18:57.540
- He didn't clock out of work today.
- That's a big surprise.

18:57.715 --> 19:00.412
No electronic footprint,
no bank accounts, credit cards.

19:00.584 --> 19:02.882
And no car registered in his name.

19:03.054 --> 19:05.819
So, what, we just think
he takes the bus everywhere?

19:05.990 --> 19:07.651
He drives an '81 Toyota Corolla.

19:08.292 --> 19:11.353
- What?
- I've got the license plate and VIN.

19:11.529 --> 19:12.553
Right here.

19:14.065 --> 19:16.090
- Hey.
- I'm sending it to you now.

19:16.967 --> 19:19.334
You want to explain to me
why you didn't share that with me?

19:19.770 --> 19:21.761
Because it's my case,
and I already told you that.

19:21.939 --> 19:23.998
- Well, technically, it's my case.
- No.

19:24.175 --> 19:28.612
Ahem. Actually, now it's our case.

19:30.214 --> 19:32.182
Consider this a joint task force.

19:32.616 --> 19:36.052
Mr. Deeks, Ms. Del Campo
will be your new partner.

19:36.220 --> 19:38.052
You want me to partner with...?

19:41.425 --> 19:44.258
Talia Del Campo,
this is Hetty Lange, my boss.

19:44.428 --> 19:46.508
And I'm pretty sure
she's the master of the universe.

19:46.664 --> 19:49.599
Lovely to meet you, ma'am, but I
won't be needing a partner. Thank you.

19:50.401 --> 19:52.870
It wasn't a request, my dear.

19:53.037 --> 19:55.233
In all fairness, Hetty,
why are we even on this?

19:55.406 --> 19:57.636
It seems like the DEA and the FBI
have it covered.

19:57.808 --> 20:00.800
If we find there's no connection
to international terrorism,

20:00.978 --> 20:02.104
we'll stand down.

20:02.279 --> 20:04.577
Meanwhile, let's play nice.

20:04.748 --> 20:06.614
Play nice. Heh-heh-heh.

20:06.784 --> 20:09.549
Deeks, I just got a hit on Mateo's car.

20:09.720 --> 20:12.155
- I'm sending it to your phone now.
- Huh.

20:12.323 --> 20:14.052
Deeks?

20:14.225 --> 20:15.624
Anyone? Hello?

20:15.793 --> 20:18.091
Explain to me
why I'm taking orders from you.

20:19.730 --> 20:22.199
Because you are a smart girl

20:22.366 --> 20:23.959
with a promising career,

20:24.135 --> 20:26.797
and I'm assuming
you'd like to keep it that way.

20:27.505 --> 20:31.237
That, and I've already cleared it
with your boss.

20:31.408 --> 20:33.206
Really? So you spoke to Williams?

20:33.377 --> 20:35.607
Uh, no. I spoke to his boss,

20:35.779 --> 20:38.111
who happens to be my godson.

20:39.583 --> 20:41.244
- Any further questions?
- No.

20:41.418 --> 20:42.778
- No further questions.
- Yes, I...

20:42.887 --> 20:44.821
- I'm actually...
- I can get my own bag.

20:44.989 --> 20:47.083
See you later.
We're gonna go check out the car.

20:47.258 --> 20:50.922
Yeah, okay, I got it.
Hang on, they just got back.

20:51.495 --> 20:52.792
A convoy of armed insurgents

20:52.963 --> 20:56.160
has been spotted making a run
for the Pakistani border.

20:56.333 --> 20:57.357
Here.

20:57.535 --> 20:59.594
We think it's the White Ghost.

20:59.770 --> 21:00.794
That's close.

21:00.971 --> 21:03.252
It's probably the same bastards
who shot down our chopper.

21:03.407 --> 21:04.932
I'll get my gear. Find me a bike.

21:05.976 --> 21:07.205
What are you gonna do?

21:07.378 --> 21:10.939
What you brought me here for.
You can talk me in.

21:18.455 --> 21:20.184
There's Mateo's Corolla.

21:20.357 --> 21:22.792
- They found it using...
- Kaleidoscope.

21:22.960 --> 21:26.362
Right. So how'd you get started
in this game, anyway?

21:27.898 --> 21:28.956
When I was a little girl,

21:32.570 --> 21:35.540
my parents got gunned down
by drug dealers.

21:36.273 --> 21:37.638
I vowed to get even.

21:40.811 --> 21:42.802
Heh. I'm just messing with you.

21:45.916 --> 21:49.443
Because you do realize that's
the origin story for Batman, right?

21:49.620 --> 21:51.054
You know, I started off in L AP.D.

21:51.222 --> 21:52.822
We probably busted
the same drug dealers.

21:52.990 --> 21:55.254
Probably not.
Most of my work is international.

21:55.426 --> 21:57.986
Mexico, Colombia, Afghanistan.

21:58.562 --> 22:00.530
- Undercover?
- Yeah.

22:00.698 --> 22:02.166
Inside the cartels?

22:02.333 --> 22:04.495
Let's just say this little assignment
is my vacation.

22:07.538 --> 22:10.030
Give me a second.
I'll pick the lock.

22:10.207 --> 22:11.368
Passenger door's open.

22:15.613 --> 22:17.081
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

22:23.187 --> 22:24.279
Glove box is empty.

22:24.455 --> 22:26.287
Looking for gunpowder, batteries,

22:26.457 --> 22:28.377
detonators, wires,
anything that could be used...

22:28.492 --> 22:29.960
Back's empty too.

22:30.127 --> 22:32.596
I think he ditched the car
and dumped the evidence.

22:33.130 --> 22:35.121
Well, not so fast.

22:35.299 --> 22:36.562
He left this.

22:38.202 --> 22:39.636
What's with your little nut?

22:40.638 --> 22:42.800
Possible shrapnel for an IED.

22:42.973 --> 22:45.670
Or this is an old car
that's falling apart.

22:45.843 --> 22:49.143
We also got this, crumpled-up
cash receipt for Club Hardware.

22:49.847 --> 22:51.372
I mean, this could nail him.

22:51.548 --> 22:53.141
What are you...?
What are you doing?

22:53.717 --> 22:54.912
Checking for drugs.

22:55.352 --> 22:56.911
Okay, that's not why we're here.

22:57.087 --> 22:59.613
So if you feel the need to swab,
maybe you can swab with this,

22:59.790 --> 23:01.349
check for explosive residue.

23:01.525 --> 23:05.052
- You can go swab yourself.
- Oh, heh, heh.

23:05.229 --> 23:06.822
Hey. You smell that?

23:06.997 --> 23:08.988
What, your Britney Spears
body mist?

23:09.166 --> 23:11.658
Heh. Cute.

23:11.835 --> 23:13.428
No, it's something industrial.

23:14.171 --> 23:16.503
Passenger floor.
It's an organic solvent.

23:17.675 --> 23:20.838
It's not muriatic acid.
It's not ether.

23:21.011 --> 23:22.809
Think these guys
were into meth or khat?

23:22.980 --> 23:25.220
We're here to connect this car
to a pressure-cooker bomb,

23:25.382 --> 23:27.851
so I don't care if they're sniffing glue
and smoking bananas.

23:28.552 --> 23:29.610
What are you doing?

23:30.854 --> 23:31.980
Really?

23:32.156 --> 23:34.625
That's not gonna help the resale.

23:36.160 --> 23:39.824
So fall transcript, electric bill...

23:40.431 --> 23:41.990
What else can you tell us about Raul?

23:42.166 --> 23:45.693
Well, no hits for fingerprints or iris
scan on any of the usual watch lists.

23:45.869 --> 23:47.098
The CSUN story hold up?

23:47.271 --> 23:49.831
Yeah, he was a registered student.

23:50.007 --> 23:52.135
He failed Geology 101.

23:52.309 --> 23:53.936
What kind of idiot fails
Rocks for Jocks?

23:54.111 --> 23:56.876
The kind that's busy building bombs.

23:57.247 --> 23:58.510
We'll take another run at him.

23:58.682 --> 24:00.275
Thank you, gentlemen.

24:11.628 --> 24:14.825
- Is that NCP code?
- Mm.

24:14.998 --> 24:17.228
Old-fashioned but effective.

24:17.401 --> 24:20.860
A back door into the Army databases
from the Middle East.

24:21.038 --> 24:22.528
The Army?

24:22.706 --> 24:26.802
Has fingerprints and iris scans
on every local they encounter.

24:28.011 --> 24:30.912
Not readily available
to law enforcement.

24:33.484 --> 24:34.883
Hetty, you have skills.

24:35.052 --> 24:38.352
UCLA Computer Science
Department,

24:38.522 --> 24:39.921
1969.

24:40.090 --> 24:41.421
19697

24:41.592 --> 24:44.391
Wasn't that the year
of the first ARPANET transmission?

24:45.629 --> 24:48.064
Mm. Yes, it was.

24:48.232 --> 24:50.826
Hetty, you were there
when they invented the Internet?

24:51.902 --> 24:53.028
Heh.

24:55.739 --> 24:56.763
There it is.

24:57.508 --> 25:00.603
See if our suspect
has a Middle Eastern pedigree.

25:00.778 --> 25:04.112
My gut tells me he's in there.

25:04.281 --> 25:05.908
We are on it.

25:17.828 --> 25:19.421
Status report, Agent Blye.

25:21.298 --> 25:22.993
I see the convoy.

25:23.167 --> 25:24.999
Getting into position.

25:26.603 --> 25:29.732
All right, let us know when you have
a positive ID on the White Ghost.

25:39.450 --> 25:40.747
You see him?

25:41.285 --> 25:42.309
Yeah, I see him.

25:42.486 --> 25:43.749
Can you make the shot?

25:44.922 --> 25:45.980
He's behind the truck.

25:46.423 --> 25:49.393
Do not let him get away.
That's an order.

25:56.300 --> 25:58.325
- I got him.
- Take the shot.

26:04.441 --> 26:07.103
Take the shot, Agent Blye.

26:12.182 --> 26:13.775
Agent Blye, take the shot.

26:18.789 --> 26:21.486
- Aah!
- Oh, my God.

26:39.042 --> 26:41.568
I'll take "Trans-Atlantic Treks"
for 200, Alex.

26:41.745 --> 26:42.803
And the answer is...

26:42.980 --> 26:44.641
Ba-bew, bew, bew.
The Daily Double.

26:46.383 --> 26:47.509
What do we have, guys?

26:47.684 --> 26:48.879
Any progress with Raul?

26:49.353 --> 26:51.617
- He's sticking to his story.
- Not for long.

26:51.788 --> 26:53.449
His biometrics are a perfect match

26:53.624 --> 26:55.649
to a guy by the name of
Massil Al-Hawati.

26:55.826 --> 26:57.851
It's an intelligence file from Iraq.

26:58.028 --> 27:00.656
Mr. Al-Hawati is actually
from Yemen.

27:00.831 --> 27:03.300
He's suspected of building IEDs
as a foreign fighter.

27:03.467 --> 27:04.907
How'd he get a passport
from Ecuador?

27:05.068 --> 27:07.799
Five months ago,
he flew from Tehran to Panama.

27:07.971 --> 27:09.029
Panama to Caracas.

27:09.206 --> 27:10.731
Obviously he made it to Ecuador.

27:11.074 --> 27:13.270
Where he created a new identity
and passport.

27:13.443 --> 27:15.673
He slipped through security at LAX
without a hitch.

27:17.548 --> 27:20.347
This is about to get interesting.

27:31.694 --> 27:33.685
You guys are actually letting me go?

27:33.863 --> 27:35.888
Your story checked out.

27:36.766 --> 27:38.530
Sorry to trouble you.

27:38.701 --> 27:40.362
How do I get home?

27:44.673 --> 27:46.232
Called you a cab.

27:46.408 --> 27:48.172
Should cover it.

27:55.618 --> 28:00.419
You know, I've heard about brutality
from American law enforcement.

28:01.757 --> 28:02.883
But you guys aren't so bad.

28:16.238 --> 28:18.297
You've spent a lot of time in Yemen.

28:19.542 --> 28:22.273
The al-Qattan district of
Hadhramaut is lovely this time of year.

28:25.681 --> 28:28.173
Well, we got Mateo
at the hardware store.

28:28.884 --> 28:31.910
Got him paying cash for 5 pounds
of screws, nuts and bolts.

28:32.087 --> 28:33.748
Still gotta catch him.

28:33.923 --> 28:36.415
- What's your Wi-Fi password?
- Uh, it's classified.

28:36.592 --> 28:37.855
Are you serious?

28:38.027 --> 28:40.359
Well, we got good 4G,
if you need to check your e-mail.

28:41.363 --> 28:43.627
I need bandwidth for the DEA site.
Come on.

28:43.799 --> 28:46.599
Listen, if you want Wi-Fi, there's
a coffee shop right down the street.

28:46.769 --> 28:48.999
You can grab me a latte
while you're there.

28:49.171 --> 28:51.333
I am starting to see
why they don't give you a partner.

28:59.615 --> 29:01.811
And I had a partner.

29:02.117 --> 29:03.676
Really?

29:04.119 --> 29:05.814
Where is he?

29:06.255 --> 29:07.848
She.

29:11.827 --> 29:12.885
I get it.

29:13.562 --> 29:15.656
You get what exactly?

29:16.165 --> 29:17.599
Nothing.

29:19.168 --> 29:21.637
She's on a classified mission,
if you really must know.

29:21.804 --> 29:24.796
Look, I had a partner
a long time ago, and, uh,

29:25.608 --> 29:29.067
things got complicated.

29:32.047 --> 29:33.537
And?

29:34.950 --> 29:37.681
I did something stupid,
and it didn't turn out so well.

29:37.853 --> 29:39.753
It's a long story.

29:41.657 --> 29:44.854
After a few margaritas,
you might get it out of me.

29:49.098 --> 29:51.760
So, what are you actually looking for?

29:51.934 --> 29:53.993
Score.

29:54.169 --> 29:57.696
- Clippers game?
- DEA lab, chemical analysis.

29:58.207 --> 30:00.767
The substance found
on the floor of Mateo's car,

30:00.943 --> 30:03.207
it's a proprietary mix
of enzymes and bacteria

30:03.379 --> 30:07.680
used to treat septic systems,
and it is unique to that industry.

30:08.250 --> 30:10.344
So you think Mateo's
cleaning septic tanks?

30:10.519 --> 30:12.248
More likely he's driving a truck.

30:12.988 --> 30:15.719
Any idea how many septic-tank
companies there are in Los Angeles?

30:16.091 --> 30:18.389
Nope. But I'm about to find out.

30:19.695 --> 30:23.097
We can cut you a break
if you tell us who's with you.

30:23.999 --> 30:26.491
We know Mateo's boss was getting
suspicious at the fish house,

30:26.669 --> 30:28.865
so you put an end to him.

30:29.038 --> 30:31.632
Almost took out a DEA agent too.

30:33.475 --> 30:35.443
My guess is AQAP.

30:35.611 --> 30:38.876
Al Qaeda of the Arabian Peninsula.
That is quite a crew.

30:40.749 --> 30:43.446
Looks like we got a little sleeper cell
going here, G.

30:46.822 --> 30:47.846
Then arrest me.

30:48.223 --> 30:51.818
So I can experience the famous
American system of justice.

30:51.994 --> 30:54.088
Innocent until proven guilty.

30:54.263 --> 30:57.164
- What's your plan?
- I'm a tourist.

30:57.333 --> 30:59.631
I wanna travel all over
your beautiful country.

31:08.410 --> 31:10.435
Read the Koran.

31:17.252 --> 31:20.916
The prophet prohibits
the killing of women and children.

31:22.391 --> 31:25.088
Tell that to your Army.

31:33.736 --> 31:34.999
What the hell happened?

31:35.170 --> 31:36.210
I didn't have a good shot.

31:36.372 --> 31:37.572
- Did you even take one?
- Yes.

31:37.740 --> 31:39.765
- And?
- And I missed, okay?

31:39.942 --> 31:41.410
I missed. I'm not... I...

31:41.577 --> 31:43.807
- I'm not even sure it was him.
- You saw his face.

31:45.147 --> 31:46.171
Blye.

31:47.750 --> 31:49.115
- Barely.
- Was he a Westerner?

31:49.284 --> 31:50.945
Yeah. No.

31:51.120 --> 31:52.349
Maybe. I don't know.

31:52.521 --> 31:54.241
I couldn't tell.
He just looked like a mooj.

31:54.390 --> 31:56.825
But he didn't look like Sabatino,
did he?

31:56.992 --> 31:59.017
- No. Anything else?
- Yeah.

31:59.728 --> 32:02.459
I want a detailed report in my hands
within the hour.

32:03.065 --> 32:05.659
Fine. I'm gonna go take a shower.

32:08.170 --> 32:10.764
Septic tanks. If you want yours
pumped clean in L.A,

32:10.939 --> 32:13.271
you've got 112 choices.

32:13.442 --> 32:15.202
Yeah, but who's got
the best reviews on Yelp?

32:15.344 --> 32:17.642
We've been running facial rec
on all security cameras

32:17.813 --> 32:20.578
near those businesses.
Two days ago,

32:21.150 --> 32:22.174
we have this.

32:22.518 --> 32:25.977
- Voila.
- Hello, Westlake Septic Service.

32:27.790 --> 32:30.316
- Hello, Mateo.
- We should probably pay him a visit.

32:30.793 --> 32:32.090
Might not be necessary.

32:32.261 --> 32:33.660
We've been tracking their trucks.

32:33.829 --> 32:37.322
Last night, one was parked
at a closed gas station after midnight.

32:37.499 --> 32:40.161
Coming off the truck.
That is one big hose.

32:40.335 --> 32:42.099
Going into the underground tank.

32:42.271 --> 32:43.391
What's the truck's capacity?

32:43.539 --> 32:45.667
Three thousand gallons.

32:45.841 --> 32:47.366
Three thousand gallons of gasoline.

32:47.776 --> 32:50.404
- That's a pretty decent fireball.
- Where's the truck now?

32:50.579 --> 32:52.069
Don't know. Never came home.

32:52.247 --> 32:54.443
Guys, track every vehicle
from Westlake Septic.

32:55.084 --> 32:56.210
- Yeah.
- Sam, Callen,

32:56.385 --> 32:58.444
can you step out
when you have a chance?

32:59.922 --> 33:02.892
They better get something big
out of this kid before it's too late.

33:17.805 --> 33:19.466
- Eric?
- I got the septic truck

33:19.640 --> 33:21.165
driving south on Lincoln Boulevard,

33:21.341 --> 33:23.139
- Playa del Rey.
- Headed right for LAX.

33:23.310 --> 33:24.869
Airport security's on alert.

33:25.412 --> 33:27.710
- Your guy have anything new to say?
- He's clammed up.

33:27.881 --> 33:28.905
Okay, got it.

33:29.083 --> 33:31.950
He's passing the airport. Looks like
he's heading for Manhattan Beach.

33:32.119 --> 33:33.985
- South Bay.
- Any events there today?

33:34.154 --> 33:35.178
Checking.

33:35.489 --> 33:37.753
The refineries, the harbor...

33:38.092 --> 33:40.052
He'd have a hard time
making it through the gates.

33:41.261 --> 33:42.901
Our plan is to minimize
collateral damage.

33:43.030 --> 33:44.759
We need to get them
to an unpopulated area.

33:44.932 --> 33:46.900
But if they get suspicious
or we start shooting...

33:47.067 --> 33:48.501
- Kaboom.
- These guys would go up

33:48.669 --> 33:50.364
- with their truck as martyrs.
- Oh, my.

33:50.738 --> 33:52.729
- What?
- The USS lowa.

33:52.906 --> 33:54.840
It's their anniversary festival.

33:55.642 --> 33:56.905
That's the perfect target.

33:57.211 --> 33:59.771
This is the same group that bombed
the USS Cole in Yemen.

33:59.947 --> 34:02.416
The lowa is expecting
5,000 guests today.

34:02.583 --> 34:04.703
Group that size is gonna need
a lot of port-a-potties.

34:04.852 --> 34:07.253
And a septic truck passes
right through security.

34:07.421 --> 34:09.253
Pretends to service the restrooms.

34:09.422 --> 34:11.915
The blast and the fireball
takes out the crowd and the crew.

34:12.092 --> 34:14.292
All right. They're gonna be
in San Pedro inside an hour.

34:14.428 --> 34:16.362
Let's do this.

34:22.136 --> 34:23.194
Showtime, Eric.

34:23.370 --> 34:24.428
Stop, dog, stop.

34:24.605 --> 34:26.072
Light's turning red.

34:31.110 --> 34:33.239
- Ready, Sam?
- Good to go.

34:35.149 --> 34:36.674
Talia?

34:37.951 --> 34:40.147
Confirming Mateo
in the passenger side.

34:40.320 --> 34:42.652
Driver's the fool
who dropped the fish on me.

34:43.023 --> 34:44.956
- Deeks?
- We got a whole wad

34:45.125 --> 34:47.422
of plastic explosives
on the underbelly.

34:47.594 --> 34:48.822
Give us five seconds of cover.

34:55.135 --> 34:56.261
Sam, all yours.

35:05.913 --> 35:07.438
Bull's-eye.

35:07.848 --> 35:09.577
- Green light.
- Got it.

35:14.354 --> 35:17.255
All right, let's move it out,
but keep your distance, everyone.

35:45.052 --> 35:46.213
Okay, we got the exit.

35:46.386 --> 35:48.186
He's moving to the far end
of the parking lot.

35:48.322 --> 35:49.346
He's all yours, Sam.

36:24.091 --> 36:26.025
Looks like you guys
could use a hand.

36:26.193 --> 36:28.491
- Uh, no, it's okay.
- Doesn't look okay.

36:28.662 --> 36:31.097
Looks like you got
some major radiator problems.

36:31.265 --> 36:32.460
Yeah, we know that.

36:32.633 --> 36:35.398
You want me to get you some water?
Get you a tow truck or...?

36:35.569 --> 36:37.901
- We're good. My friend is a mechanic.
- Oh, that's good.

36:38.338 --> 36:40.218
I'm a federal agent.
Put your hands on the hood!

36:40.641 --> 36:42.837
Spread your feet! Don't move!

36:43.810 --> 36:45.642
I said hands on the hood!

36:55.889 --> 36:58.881
- I got the runner.
- I got the bomb.

37:01.228 --> 37:03.959
Deeks, he's coming your way.
Watch for a carjacking.

37:04.131 --> 37:06.566
- Look out for bystanders!
- Copy that. Hold on tight.

37:12.272 --> 37:13.899
Get out of the way!

37:17.711 --> 37:18.872
Stay down!

37:19.947 --> 37:21.244
Freeze!

37:24.151 --> 37:25.915
Get out of the car! Get out of the car!

37:26.086 --> 37:28.316
- Aah! Aah!
- Shut up!

37:29.089 --> 37:31.217
I got a cell phone detonator
on the truck.

37:31.959 --> 37:33.393
I can disable it in a minute.

37:33.560 --> 37:34.721
We may not have a minute.

37:35.095 --> 37:36.324
He's got his cell out.

37:36.496 --> 37:37.554
Your shot, Deeks.

37:37.731 --> 37:40.666
- Hostage. No shot. No shot.
- Damn it, he's dialing.

37:40.834 --> 37:43.496
- Aah! Aah!
- Sam, get out of there now!

37:55.315 --> 37:57.283
Shooter down!

38:11.498 --> 38:13.626
- Lucky shot, Deeks, huh?
- Thanks, brother.

38:13.800 --> 38:16.428
- Sam, you good?
- I'm good.

38:24.177 --> 38:26.009
What do you say
we hit the Jowa festival?

38:26.513 --> 38:29.448
Yeah. That's what I need right now,
is a churro.

38:36.857 --> 38:38.951
- Thanks for the ride.
- It's my pleasure.

38:40.327 --> 38:42.193
Ahh. Such a long day.

38:42.362 --> 38:44.729
You know, I picked up the fish van
this morning at 1 a.m.

38:46.633 --> 38:47.794
Yikes.

38:47.968 --> 38:49.697
Oh, you are gonna like this.

38:49.870 --> 38:51.031
What do you have?

38:51.204 --> 38:53.468
So Customs found
a plastic bag of contraband

38:53.640 --> 38:55.165
in tonight's seafood shipment.

38:55.542 --> 38:58.409
- Ten bucks on cocaine.
- Hundred-dollar bills.

38:59.780 --> 39:01.748
And that's how they funded
the sleeper cell.

39:01.915 --> 39:03.679
You can always find
some drug residue

39:03.850 --> 39:05.716
on cash from South America.

39:05.886 --> 39:08.753
That is actually how I got
pulled into this kettle of fish.

39:10.857 --> 39:13.087
- Ba-dum-boom.
- Ba-dum-boom.

39:14.227 --> 39:16.753
You know, uh,
you don't need me to tell you this,

39:16.930 --> 39:18.989
but you did good today.

39:19.166 --> 39:21.760
Thank you.
It was good working with you too.

39:21.935 --> 39:23.494
It was

39:24.337 --> 39:25.566
different.

39:25.739 --> 39:27.173
- Different?
- Different.

39:27.340 --> 39:29.104
That's a positive connotation, right?

39:32.579 --> 39:35.179
You never finished telling me
what happened with your old partner.

39:36.650 --> 39:40.382
Well, you know,
you never got me liquored up.

39:45.592 --> 39:49.460
Short version is Sophie's choice,
Morton's fork.

39:50.964 --> 39:53.934
Kobayashi Maru,
a no-win situation.

39:54.101 --> 39:55.728
Yeah.

39:55.902 --> 39:57.961
And so, what'd you chose?

39:59.039 --> 40:01.736
I chose to stay with the DEA.

40:01.908 --> 40:03.706
I had to.

40:05.078 --> 40:06.273
And what about your partner?

40:08.982 --> 40:11.144
He had to leave the agency,

40:12.085 --> 40:13.951
and me.

40:16.990 --> 40:19.823
Ahem. Anyways, sorry,
I have to get some sleep.

40:19.993 --> 40:21.552
Of course.

40:23.029 --> 40:25.191
You know,
if you're ever a free agent,

40:25.799 --> 40:28.200
the DEA is really
not a bad place to work.

40:28.368 --> 40:29.995
Okay.

40:34.040 --> 40:35.735
Good night, partner.

40:56.129 --> 40:59.099
I don't know about you,
but I'm ready for some ikura.

40:59.566 --> 41:01.967
- Ruibe.
- Ika somen.

41:02.135 --> 41:04.433
- What?
- Ika somen. Didn't you hear?

41:05.071 --> 41:08.439
Talia got to know one of the sushi
chefs down at the fish market.

41:09.042 --> 41:12.205
- Not just any chef.
- Nobi Kusuhara.

41:12.379 --> 41:15.940
He's like the Rick James of sushi.

41:17.651 --> 41:19.881
What better way
to celebrate a victory?

41:20.053 --> 41:24.422
And we get our own
private tasting menu. Just for us.

41:24.591 --> 41:26.081
Yeah, I don't know.

41:26.259 --> 41:29.024
Deeks. It's a once-in-a-lifetime deal.

41:29.196 --> 41:32.188
Yeah, I know, I just... I'm kind of...
I'm just kind of beat, you know?

41:32.732 --> 41:34.257
Beat?

41:34.467 --> 41:35.764
Come on, Deeks.

41:35.936 --> 41:38.530
You'll get to meet
Callen's lady friend,

41:39.005 --> 41:41.064
have a little sticky rice...

41:41.841 --> 41:44.310
Okay. You know what?
Yeah. I, um...

41:44.477 --> 41:47.637
Why don't you guys go, and I'll...? Maybe
I'll rally later. I'll meet you there.

41:47.747 --> 41:49.875
Oh, that'll be nice.

41:53.887 --> 41:56.515
You hear a lot of that
at the restaurant, so you know,

41:56.690 --> 41:58.590
you should come.

42:18.378 --> 42:20.039
Come on.

42:56.383 --> 42:58.681
Six more weeks of winter.
