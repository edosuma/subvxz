WEBVTT

00:03.133 --> 00:04.333
- HOW IS IT?

00:04.333 --> 00:05.467
- GREAT.

00:05.467 --> 00:07.467
HOW MUCH MORE DO WE HAVE TO EAT
BEFORE DESSERT?

00:09.300 --> 00:10.700
- THIS AIN'T YOU'RE NIGHT, KID.

00:10.700 --> 00:12.033
I MADE DESSERT TOO.

00:15.333 --> 00:17.000
- HEY, RAY.
- HI, DADDY.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.500
- HEY, DEB.

00:19.500 --> 00:21.133
CHILDREN.

00:23.167 --> 00:24.367
- WHAT IS IT?

00:24.367 --> 00:26.000
OH, YOU JUST CAME
FROM THE DOCTOR.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.433
- YES.

00:27.433 --> 00:28.700
- AND?

00:30.200 --> 00:32.700
- HE SAID THAT MY ADENOIDS
HAVE TO COME OUT.

00:36.633 --> 00:40.233
- ALL RIGHT, SO I GUESS
YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT DONE.

00:40.233 --> 00:41.433
- IS THAT IT?

00:41.433 --> 00:42.633
THAT'S YOUR ATTITUDE?

00:42.633 --> 00:43.833
- COME ON.

00:43.833 --> 00:45.067
- THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY?

00:45.067 --> 00:47.700
"GO AHEAD, DOC,
CUT THAT FAT BOY UP."

00:49.733 --> 00:51.600
- HONEY, I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU'RE NERVOUS,

00:51.600 --> 00:53.867
BUT THIS IS
A VERY COMMON PROCEDURE,

00:53.867 --> 00:55.067
AND THEY DON'T CUT YOU UP.

00:55.067 --> 00:56.600
THEY GO IN THROUGH YOUR MOUTH.

00:56.600 --> 00:59.567
- WELL, I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE
GOING THROUGH MY MOUTH!

00:59.567 --> 01:01.767
- YOU'VE BEEN GETTING
SORE THROATS FOR TWO YEARS.

01:01.767 --> 01:03.067
YOUR SNORING IS GETTING WORSE.

01:03.067 --> 01:04.967
YOU'RE HAVING
DIFFICULTY SWALLOWING...

01:04.967 --> 01:07.667
- ME TOO.
- EAT YOUR FOOD.

01:10.433 --> 01:12.533
WE WILL ALL BE SO MUCH HAPPIER

01:12.533 --> 01:14.067
WHEN YOU GET THIS DONE,
RIGHT, KIDS?

01:14.067 --> 01:15.700
- YEAH.
- UH-HUH.

01:15.700 --> 01:17.467
- YEAH, THAT'S 'CAUSE
YOU THINK MOM'S GONNA

01:17.467 --> 01:19.600
TAKE THE INSURANCE MONEY
AND BUY EVERYONE A PONY.

01:21.633 --> 01:23.467
- YOUR THROAT HURTS,
DOESN'T IT?

01:23.467 --> 01:24.467
- NO.

01:24.467 --> 01:25.933
NO, LOOK, I WANT
A SECOND OPINION.

01:25.933 --> 01:27.367
- THIS IS YOUR THIRD OPINION.

01:27.367 --> 01:29.100
- THOSE DOCTORS,
THEY JUST WANT MONEY!

01:29.100 --> 01:30.800
I DON'T TRUST THEM!

01:30.800 --> 01:32.433
I WANT AN EXPERT!

01:32.433 --> 01:34.200
- I GOT YOUR MESSAGE,
RAYMOND.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.533
DON'T LET THEM TOUCH YOU!

01:37.733 --> 01:38.933
- I WON'T, MOM!

01:38.933 --> 01:40.267
I WON'T!

01:47.433 --> 01:48.900
- DEBRA DOESN'T CARE, MA,
YOU KNOW?

01:48.900 --> 01:51.067
SHE ACTUALLY SAID THAT
GETTING YOUR ADENOIDS OUT

01:51.067 --> 01:52.267
IS NO BIG DEAL!

01:52.267 --> 01:55.167
- IT'S A VERY BIG DEAL.

01:55.167 --> 01:57.700
THEY WANT TO TAKE A PIECE
OF MY RAYMOND AWAY.

02:00.200 --> 02:02.433
I HAVE ALL THE MEDICINE WE NEED
RIGHT HERE.

02:02.433 --> 02:04.300
I MADE YOU SOME MINESTRONE SOUP.

02:04.300 --> 02:05.700
ALL RIGHT, CHILDREN,

02:05.700 --> 02:07.467
YOU DON'T HAVE TO EAT
ANY MORE OF THAT.

02:07.467 --> 02:08.600
all: YAY!

02:11.467 --> 02:12.667
- SIT DOWN.

02:12.667 --> 02:14.200
OKAY.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.867
HERE.
NOW.

02:15.867 --> 02:17.867
PUT YOUR FACE RIGHT IN HERE.

02:17.867 --> 02:19.067
THAT'S IT, RIGHT THERE.

02:19.067 --> 02:20.267
AND BREATH IN.

02:20.267 --> 02:22.367
IT'S ALL GOOD FOR YOU.

02:22.367 --> 02:24.300
- MARIE, YOU REALLY THINK FOOD
IS GONNA TAKE CARE

02:24.300 --> 02:25.800
OF RAY'S ADENOID PROBLEM?

02:25.800 --> 02:27.200
- I THINK GOODFOOD WILL.

02:29.167 --> 02:30.633
- MARIE, WHAT DID YOU DO
WITH THAT SOUP?

02:30.633 --> 02:32.200
- THE SOUP IS NOT
FOR YOU, FRANK.

02:32.200 --> 02:33.800
- I'VE BEEN
SMELLING IT ALL DAY,

02:33.800 --> 02:35.200
AND THEN YOU TAKE IT AWAY?

02:35.200 --> 02:38.167
YOU SOUP TEASE.

02:38.167 --> 02:39.367
- COME ON, GUYS, HUH?
CUT IT OUT.

02:39.367 --> 02:40.767
- COME OVER HERE.
HERE WE GO.

02:40.767 --> 02:42.067
- NO, NO, NO!

02:42.067 --> 02:43.600
- OH, THERE'S ENOUGH
FOR EVERYBODY!

02:43.600 --> 02:44.600
JUST TAKE IT EASY!

02:44.600 --> 02:46.733
- IT'S--
THE SOUP IS FOR RAYMOND!

02:46.733 --> 02:48.067
IT'S HIS MEDICINE!

02:56.333 --> 02:59.100
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST QUIT
BABYING HIM, MA, HUH?

02:59.100 --> 03:00.733
THEY SHOULD JUST
RIP OUT YOUR ADENOIDS

03:00.733 --> 03:02.033
AND BE DONE WITH IT.

03:02.033 --> 03:03.833
- YEAH, JUST GO IN,
DROP YOUR DRAWERS,

03:03.833 --> 03:05.333
BING, BANG, BOOM.

03:07.767 --> 03:09.600
- DROP YOUR DRAWERS?

03:09.600 --> 03:14.600
- DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHERE
THE ADENOIDS ARE, DAD?

03:14.600 --> 03:17.133
- SURE, ROUND BACK WITH
THE REST OF THE "OIDS."

03:19.333 --> 03:20.933
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS, COME ON.

03:20.933 --> 03:23.100
COME ON, ALL RIGHT?
IT'S A LITTLE CROWDED IN HERE.

03:23.100 --> 03:24.500
- YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED?

03:24.500 --> 03:25.800
A BIGGER TABLE.

03:25.800 --> 03:27.500
- NO, I DON'T.
I DON'T NEED A BIGGER TABLE!

03:27.500 --> 03:28.900
I NEED YOU GUYS
OUT OF HERE!

03:28.900 --> 03:32.600
- AWW, WOOK AT WITTLE WAYMOND.

03:32.600 --> 03:35.900
ALL UPSET 'CAUSE THEY'RE GONNA
TAKE HIS LITTLE ADENOIDS OUT.

03:35.900 --> 03:39.167
[infant gibberish]

03:39.167 --> 03:40.900
- FORGET ABOUT IT.
I'M NOT DOING IT.

03:40.900 --> 03:42.233
- YES, YOU ARE.

03:42.233 --> 03:43.500
WHAT KIND OF EXAMPLE
DO YOU THINK

03:43.500 --> 03:44.733
YOU'RE SETTING
FOR THE KIDS?

03:44.733 --> 03:46.367
- YEAH, AND WHILE
YOU'RE IN THERE,

03:46.367 --> 03:48.567
HAVE THE DOCTOR LOOK AT
YOUR UNENJOYABLE TESTICLE.

03:51.800 --> 03:54.000
- IT'S UNDESCENDED,DAD.

04:01.133 --> 04:03.533
- YES, AND DO YOU
ENJOY IT THAT WAY?

04:11.000 --> 04:12.200
- RAYMOND HAS
HIS ADENOIDS OUT,

04:12.200 --> 04:15.967
THE WHOLE WORLD
HAS TO STOP.

04:15.967 --> 04:17.400
- ROBERT, IT'S OKAY.

04:17.400 --> 04:19.067
HE FEELS BETTER
THAT WE'RE HERE.

04:19.067 --> 04:22.467
- OH, HE HAS NO FEELINGS.

04:22.467 --> 04:24.400
THE ONLY REASON I'M HERE
IS BECAUSE MA KNOWS

04:24.400 --> 04:26.300
THAT I'M THE SAME
BLOOD TYPE AS HIM.

04:32.333 --> 04:35.400
- NOT EVERYTHING'S
ABOUT YOU, ROBERT.

04:35.400 --> 04:39.033
AND KEEP YOUR SLEEVES
ROLLED UP.

04:39.033 --> 04:41.200
- MAYBE I HAD OTHER THINGS
TO DO TODAY.

04:41.200 --> 04:42.467
- ENOUGH.

04:42.467 --> 04:44.233
THIS IS WHAT A FAMILY DOES.

04:44.233 --> 04:45.700
WE STICK TOGETHER.

04:45.700 --> 04:47.100
WE SUPPORT EACH OTHER.

04:47.100 --> 04:51.733
- STOP LOOKING AT MY VEINS!

04:51.733 --> 04:54.100
- COME ON.

04:54.100 --> 04:56.067
THIS WEEK HAS BEEN
BAD ENOUGH AS IT IS.

04:56.067 --> 04:58.067
RAY'S BEEN DRIVING ME CRAZY.

04:58.067 --> 04:59.400
LAST NIGHT HE WOKE ME UP.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.067
"WHAT IF THE NURSE'S TOP
IS UNBUTTONED

05:01.067 --> 05:02.733
AND THE SURGEON
GETS DISTRACTED?"

05:05.233 --> 05:06.900
- OH, ALL RIGHT,
STOP IT, STOP.

05:06.900 --> 05:09.500
I'M GOING TO THE POWDER ROOM
FOR A MOMENT,

05:09.500 --> 05:12.200
AND WHEN I GET BACK,
I EXPECT EVERYONE

05:12.200 --> 05:15.133
TO HAVE A PROPER LOOK
OF CONCERN ON THEIR FACES.

05:16.767 --> 05:18.133
ROBERT!

05:24.767 --> 05:25.967
- DEBRA BARONE?

05:25.967 --> 05:28.267
- YEP.

05:28.267 --> 05:29.733
HI, HOW'D IT GO?

05:29.733 --> 05:31.800
- MRS. BARONE, ARE THERE
ANY ALLERGIES OR CONDITIONS

05:31.800 --> 05:34.100
YOUR HUSBAND MAY HAVE
NEGLECTED TO TELL US ABOUT?

05:34.100 --> 05:35.767
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHY?

05:35.767 --> 05:40.333
- WELL, WE'RE HAVING DIFFICULTY
BRINGING HIM OUT OF ANESTHESIA.

05:40.333 --> 05:41.733
- HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN OUT
BY NOW.

05:41.733 --> 05:43.333
HE'S NOT RESPONDING.

05:43.333 --> 05:45.600
HIS BLOOD PRESSURE'S
DROPPED BELOW A CERTAIN LEVEL.

05:45.600 --> 05:46.800
- ROBERT.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.000
- WHAT IS IT?
WHAT?

05:48.000 --> 05:49.267
- HE'S NOT--

05:49.267 --> 05:50.833
- WHAT, RAYMOND?
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

05:50.833 --> 05:52.367
- HE'S NOT WAKING UP.

05:52.367 --> 05:54.000
- LET ME GO IN THERE.
I'M HIS BLOOD TYPE.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.300
NO, NO, NO, LISTEN TO ME.

05:55.300 --> 05:57.700
HE IS MY BROTHER.
I CAN WAKE HIM UP.

05:57.700 --> 05:58.967
RAYMOND!

05:58.967 --> 06:00.167
- HI, ARE YOU THE BARONES?

06:00.167 --> 06:01.933
- MY BROTHER'S IN THERE.
RAYMOND!

06:01.933 --> 06:03.267
- HE'S FINE NOW.

06:04.833 --> 06:06.833
HIS BLOOD PRESSURE'S
RETURNING TO NORMAL,

06:06.833 --> 06:08.600
AND HE'S COMING OUT OF IT.

06:08.600 --> 06:09.600
THIS HAPPENS SOMETIMES.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.000
IT'S A FORM OF HYPERTENSION,

06:11.000 --> 06:14.833
BUT HE'S PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT.

06:14.833 --> 06:16.300
- THANK YOU.

06:19.733 --> 06:22.700
- YOU CAN SEE HIM
IN A FEW MINUTES.

06:22.700 --> 06:25.300
- OH, MY GOD.

06:25.300 --> 06:27.000
- OKAY, BUT IT WAS FINE.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.233
- YES.

06:28.233 --> 06:30.567
- HE SAID IT WENT FINE.
IT WENT GOOD.

06:30.567 --> 06:32.667
- I NOTICED THE NURSE
WAS STILL BUTTONED.

06:38.900 --> 06:40.100
- OKAY.

06:40.100 --> 06:43.633
OKAY, NOW LISTEN.

06:43.633 --> 06:46.200
WHAT HAPPENED IN THERE--

06:46.200 --> 06:49.133
NOBODY TELLS RAY.

06:52.533 --> 06:54.300
- OR HIS MOTHER.

07:08.067 --> 07:09.633
- OKAY, HERE YOU GO.

07:09.633 --> 07:11.867
GOT YOU EVERY
SPORTS MAGAZINE I COULD FIND,

07:11.867 --> 07:13.067
INCLUDING WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL.

07:13.067 --> 07:14.733
- OH.

07:14.733 --> 07:17.233
OH, WELL, LET'S SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THAT SPORT.

07:19.633 --> 07:22.267
- SO HOW YOU FEELING?

07:22.267 --> 07:23.733
- I'M FEELING GOOD.

07:23.733 --> 07:26.700
YOU KNOW, MY THROAT,
IT HURTS JUST A LITTLE BIT,

07:26.700 --> 07:29.367
BUT THIS MIGHT HELP.

07:51.700 --> 07:52.900
HOW YOU DOING?

07:52.900 --> 07:54.233
- GOOD.
I'M GOOD.

08:02.067 --> 08:04.267
- YOU WANT
SOME OF MY ICE CREAM?

08:04.267 --> 08:05.667
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

08:05.667 --> 08:06.867
YOU ENJOY THAT.

08:06.867 --> 08:08.333
THAT'S FOR YOU.

08:08.333 --> 08:09.667
- I MADE A SWIRLY.

08:14.067 --> 08:16.767
OH, UM,

08:16.767 --> 08:19.033
I GOT SOME ON MY BLANKET

08:19.033 --> 08:20.233
AND SOME ON MY PAJAMAS.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.433
- I DON'T CARE.

08:21.433 --> 08:24.300
- OH, OKAY.
GOOD.

08:24.300 --> 08:27.067
'CAUSE I GOT SOME
ON YOUR PILLOW TOO.

08:27.067 --> 08:28.400
YEAH, SORRY.

08:40.933 --> 08:42.733
WHAT'S UP?

08:42.733 --> 08:45.267
- NOTHING, JUST THINKING.

08:45.267 --> 08:48.067
JUST--
TOMORROW.

08:48.067 --> 08:49.667
EVERYTHING I HAVE TO DO.

08:49.667 --> 08:50.867
ALL THE STUFF.

08:50.867 --> 08:52.800
YOU KNOW, MAKE BREAKFAST,

08:52.800 --> 08:55.133
TAKE THE KIDS TO SCHOOL.

08:55.133 --> 08:57.167
I HAVE SOME
GROCERY SHOPPING.

08:57.167 --> 09:00.700
WE NEED CHICKEN
AND SOME GREEN BEANS

09:00.700 --> 09:04.300
AND CEREAL AND...

09:04.300 --> 09:08.533
SHAMPOO AND POTATOES AND...

09:08.533 --> 09:09.667
COOKIES.

09:12.100 --> 09:13.667
THEN I HAVE TO PICK UP
THE DRY CLEANING

09:13.667 --> 09:16.300
'CAUSE THEY STILL HAVE
SOME OF YOUR SHIRTS...

09:17.967 --> 09:19.500
AND THEN GET THE KIDS

09:19.500 --> 09:24.500
AND TAKE THE BOYS TO SOCCER.

09:24.500 --> 09:28.133
GOT NEW UNIFORMS.
THEY'RE REALLY CUTE.

09:28.133 --> 09:29.333
AND I THOUGHT
YOU COULD MEET US

09:29.333 --> 09:31.533
AT MARCO'S FOR DINNER, MAYBE.

09:31.533 --> 09:34.067
YOU KNOW, JUST GET A PIZZA
AND THEN GO HOME AND...

09:35.733 --> 09:36.967
PUT THE KIDS TO BED,

09:36.967 --> 09:39.267
AND THEN MAYBE WE COULD
WATCH A MOVIE.

09:43.933 --> 09:45.267
- TIME OF THE MONTH, HUH?

09:50.600 --> 09:51.733
- NO, RAY.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
NO, I'M FINE.
REALLY.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.400
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

09:57.400 --> 09:59.433
OKAY.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.767
YOU KNOW, I COULD
PICK UP THE DRY CLEANING

10:01.767 --> 10:03.100
IF YOU WANT ME TO.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.733
- I DON'T WANT YOU TO.

10:06.733 --> 10:09.367
YOU ALWAYS BRING HOME
SOMEBODY ELSE'S.

10:14.067 --> 10:15.500
- WOW.

10:15.500 --> 10:19.633
I GUESS THIS NEW VOICE,
IT'S PRETTY SEXY, RIGHT?

10:19.633 --> 10:21.567
- I'M SORRY, DO YOU WANT
TO FINISH YOUR ICE CREAM?

10:21.567 --> 10:23.333
- OH, IT WON'T EVEN
HAVE TIME TO MELT.

10:23.333 --> 10:24.467
- OKAY.

10:36.067 --> 10:37.400
- FRANK?

10:38.600 --> 10:40.067
- YEAH?

10:40.067 --> 10:42.567
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:42.567 --> 10:44.533
- JUST THINKING.

10:44.533 --> 10:46.733
- WHAT'S THE MATTER,
THE TV BROKEN?

10:52.533 --> 10:53.533
- NO.

10:53.533 --> 10:55.233
- LOOK, IF YOU'RE WORRIED

10:55.233 --> 10:56.867
ABOUT ROBERT EATING
THAT LAST PIECE OF PIE,

10:56.867 --> 10:59.433
WHY DON'T YOU GO DOWN
AND GET IT RIGHT NOW?

11:09.133 --> 11:12.433
FRANK, GET THE PIE YOURSELF.

11:12.433 --> 11:14.067
- I DON'T WANT THE PIE.

11:14.067 --> 11:17.600
WHAT, A GUY CAN'T JUST
TOUCH HIS WIFE'S SHOULDER?

11:17.600 --> 11:20.700
- FRANK, IT'S LATE,
AND I'M NOT IN THE MOOD.

11:20.700 --> 11:22.600
- AW,

11:22.600 --> 11:24.633
THIS AIN'T THAT.

11:24.633 --> 11:28.233
YOU KNOW,
I WAS THINKING, UH,

11:28.233 --> 11:31.300
SOMETIMES I SAY STUFF,
LIKE, YOU KNOW,

11:31.300 --> 11:33.333
YOU'RE OLD.

11:33.333 --> 11:36.400
YOU GOT A BIG MOUTH.

11:36.400 --> 11:39.900
YOU'RE A PAIN
IN THE ASS.

11:39.900 --> 11:43.400
- OH, WELL, NOW I'M IN THE MOOD.

11:49.600 --> 11:52.233
- NO, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE HELL I'M SAYING.

11:54.167 --> 11:57.733
IT'S JUST THAT
I'M GLAD WE'RE--

11:57.733 --> 11:59.800
YOU KNOW?

11:59.800 --> 12:01.200
- ALL RIGHT, FRANK.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.533
WHAT'S GOING ON?

12:02.533 --> 12:04.967
- WHAT?
- WELL, SOMETHING'S WRONG.

12:04.967 --> 12:09.167
YOU DON'T JUST SAY NO TO PIE
AND TOUCH MY SHOULDER AND THINK.

12:10.467 --> 12:12.333
YOU HAVE BEEN ACTING WEIRD

12:12.333 --> 12:15.533
EVER SINCE WE GOT BACK
FROM THE HOSPITAL TODAY.

12:15.533 --> 12:18.933
- UH, ON SECOND THOUGHT,
I DO WANT SEX.

12:18.933 --> 12:21.600
YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL,
I CAN'T RESIST YOU, HONEY.

12:23.767 --> 12:25.200
- REALLY?

12:25.200 --> 12:26.967
SINCE WHEN DO YOU SAY THAT?

12:26.967 --> 12:30.333
USUALLY, ALL I GET IS,
"HEY, COME HERE A MINUTE."

12:37.000 --> 12:38.633
WHAT IS IT, FRANK?

12:38.633 --> 12:39.767
JUST TELL ME.

12:42.267 --> 12:44.633
- OKAY, IT'S NO BIG DEAL NOW,

12:44.633 --> 12:47.033
BUT YOU GOT TO PROMISE
NOT TO TELL ANYBODY I TOLD YOU.

12:47.033 --> 12:49.067
- OF COURSE I PROMISE.

12:49.067 --> 12:50.667
WHAT IS IT?

12:50.667 --> 12:53.067
- WHEN YOU WERE IN THE HOSPITAL
AND WENT TO THE BATHROOM...

12:53.067 --> 12:54.433
- MM-HMM.

12:54.433 --> 12:56.000
- THE NURSE CAME OUT AND SAID
THEY WERE HAVING

12:56.000 --> 12:58.500
A LITTLE TROUBLE WAKING UP RAY
FROM THE KNOCKOUT STUFF.

12:58.500 --> 12:59.500
- WHAT?

12:59.500 --> 13:00.933
- TWO SECONDS LATER,
HE WAS FINE!

13:00.933 --> 13:02.467
PERFECTLY FINE!

13:02.467 --> 13:08.000
- MY SON ALMOSTDIES,
AND YOU DON'T TELL ME?

13:08.000 --> 13:10.267
- HE WAS FINE!
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

13:10.267 --> 13:12.233
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

13:12.233 --> 13:13.867
- HE'S FINE!

13:13.867 --> 13:15.633
MARIE, WAIT!

13:15.633 --> 13:17.300
HEY, COME HERE A MINUTE!

13:22.000 --> 13:23.200
- RAYMOND!

13:23.200 --> 13:24.800
OH, RAYMOND!

13:24.800 --> 13:26.000
OH, MY SWEET RAYMOND!

13:26.000 --> 13:28.167
- HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY!

13:31.000 --> 13:33.367
MA!

13:33.367 --> 13:35.567
OH, MA!

13:35.567 --> 13:37.333
MA, PLEASE!

13:39.533 --> 13:43.700
- I KNEW ONE DAY
THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

13:43.700 --> 13:45.133
- MA!

13:45.133 --> 13:47.100
WHAT--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:47.100 --> 13:48.567
- MARIE, COME ON,
GET OUT OF THERE!

13:48.567 --> 13:50.467
COME BACK ACROSS
THE STREET WITH ME!

13:50.467 --> 13:52.000
- I'M NOT SPEAKING TO YOU!

13:52.000 --> 13:53.200
- EVEN BETTER!

13:53.200 --> 13:54.533
JUST GET OUT OF THERE!

13:56.267 --> 13:59.167
- FRANK, WHAT DID YOU DO?

13:59.167 --> 14:01.667
- I TOLD HER WHAT HAPPENED.
- WHAT?

14:01.667 --> 14:04.033
- SHE BEAT IT OUT OF ME.

14:04.033 --> 14:05.267
- WOULD SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL ME

14:05.267 --> 14:09.833
WHY MY WORST NIGHTMARE
IS COMING TRUE?

14:09.833 --> 14:11.367
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

14:11.367 --> 14:13.500
YOU ALMOST BOUGHT THE FARM
DURING THE ADENOID THING,

14:13.500 --> 14:15.300
AND YOUR MOTHER'S MAKING
A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT!

14:15.300 --> 14:16.700
- WHAT DO YOU--
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

14:16.700 --> 14:17.767
WHAT HAPPENED?

14:17.767 --> 14:19.300
- YOU HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE
WAKING UP,

14:19.300 --> 14:20.833
BUT IT WAS NOTHING.

14:20.833 --> 14:23.233
- IF IT WAS NOTHING,
WHY DIDN'T ANYBODY TELL ME?

14:23.233 --> 14:24.767
- WELL, WAIT A MINUTE.

14:24.767 --> 14:27.100
GET OFF ME, MA.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.500
WHAT HAPPENED?

14:28.500 --> 14:29.700
- HOLD IT.

14:29.700 --> 14:31.133
I AM THE MOTHER,

14:31.133 --> 14:33.267
AND WHEN THE MOTHER
GOES TO THE BATHROOM,

14:33.267 --> 14:35.267
YOU HAVE TO TELL HER
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED

14:35.267 --> 14:37.100
WHILE SHE WAS IN THERE.

14:37.100 --> 14:38.667
- OF COURSE YOU'RE RIGHT,

14:38.667 --> 14:40.400
BUT WE JUST DIDN'T
WANT TO UPSET YOU.

14:40.400 --> 14:41.800
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT ME?

14:41.800 --> 14:43.133
HOW COULD YOU NOT TELL ME THIS?

14:43.133 --> 14:46.000
IF SOMEBODY DIES,
YOU GOT TO TELL THEM.

14:46.000 --> 14:47.400
- YOU DIDN'T DIE.

14:47.400 --> 14:48.800
- YEAH, WELL, WHAT IF I DID?

14:48.800 --> 14:51.467
I WOULD HAVE NEVER KNOWN.

14:51.467 --> 14:53.800
AND BESIDES, NOW THAT
I THINK ABOUT IT,

14:53.800 --> 14:55.733
I THINK I SAW A LIGHT.

14:55.733 --> 14:56.933
- COME ON.

14:56.933 --> 14:58.233
- YES!

14:58.233 --> 14:59.733
AND ALSO, I THOUGHT
I HEARD SOMEONE

14:59.733 --> 15:01.067
WHO SOUNDED LIKE UNCLE GUS.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.667
- UNCLE GUS DIED
EIGHT YEARS AGO.

15:03.667 --> 15:07.100
HOW'D HE LOOK?

15:07.100 --> 15:08.667
- WAIT A MINUTE.

15:08.667 --> 15:11.900
WAIT A MINUTE, I'VE BEEN FEELING
A LITTLE WEIRD ALL DAY.

15:11.900 --> 15:13.467
WHAT IF--

15:13.467 --> 15:15.133
WHAT IF I LOST
SOME BRAIN FUNCTIONS

15:15.133 --> 15:17.767
WHILE I WAS UNDER, HUH?

15:17.767 --> 15:18.967
LOOK AT THIS.

15:18.967 --> 15:20.167
LOOK AT THIS.

15:20.167 --> 15:21.933
I'M WALKING WEIRD.

15:21.933 --> 15:24.900
- THAT'S BECAUSE YOUR MOTHER
WAS JUST ON YOU.

15:24.900 --> 15:27.633
- NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO.

15:27.633 --> 15:29.133
I'M WALKING
A LITTLE LOPSIDED.

15:29.133 --> 15:30.867
- ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE FINE, RAY.

15:30.867 --> 15:32.800
- HOP ON ONE FOOT.
- YEAH?

15:32.800 --> 15:34.000
- WHAT'S YOUR ADDRESS?

15:34.000 --> 15:35.433
- UH, 320 FOWLER.

15:35.433 --> 15:37.133
- WHAT TOWN?
- LYNBROOK.

15:37.133 --> 15:38.533
- WHAT'S MY BIRTHDAY?

15:38.533 --> 15:40.233
- UH...

15:40.233 --> 15:43.600
- OH, MY GOD!

15:43.600 --> 15:45.600
- NO, DECEMBER 9TH!

15:45.600 --> 15:47.700
- 1802!

15:50.133 --> 15:51.600
- WAIT A MINUTE.

15:51.600 --> 15:53.733
HOW ABOUT THIS THING?
HOW ABOUT THIS THING?

15:59.600 --> 16:03.267
- SO I GUESS NOW WE'LL WATCH
RAYMOND DO ANYTHING.

16:06.100 --> 16:07.900
- HE FOUND OUT WHAT HAPPENED.

16:07.900 --> 16:09.200
- WAIT A MINUTE, HE KNOWS?

16:09.200 --> 16:13.700
- YES, AND I KNOW, TOO, AMY.

16:13.700 --> 16:15.000
- WAIT A MINUTE.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.200
EVERYBODY KNOWS?

16:16.200 --> 16:17.400
HOW LONG WAS I DEAD FOR?

16:17.400 --> 16:18.400
- YOU WEREN'T DEAD.

16:18.400 --> 16:19.733
LOOK, THE NURSE CAME OUT,

16:19.733 --> 16:21.400
SAID THEY WERE HAVING
A SLIGHT PROBLEM,

16:21.400 --> 16:23.067
AND THE DOCTOR CAME OUT
30 SECONDS LATER

16:23.067 --> 16:24.300
AND SAID YOU WERE FINE.

16:24.300 --> 16:27.200
- OKAY, BUT--
BUT FOR 30 SECONDS,

16:27.200 --> 16:29.500
YOU ALL THOUGHT
I MIGHTBE DEAD.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.133
WHAT'D EVERYBODY DO?

16:39.733 --> 16:42.100
- YOU WEREN'T DEAD!
IT WAS 30 SECONDS!

16:42.100 --> 16:43.900
- 30 SECONDS IS A LONG TIME!

16:43.900 --> 16:45.200
WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR HEAD?

16:45.200 --> 16:46.933
30 SECONDS--
OKAY, GO.

16:46.933 --> 16:48.167
"OH, OH, I HAVE TO PLAN
A FUNERAL.

16:48.167 --> 16:50.333
"I HAVE TO RAISE
THREE KIDS MYSELF.

16:50.333 --> 16:52.767
"ON THE OTHER HAND,
I CAN START DATING.

16:52.767 --> 16:54.500
"YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA NEED SOME SHOES.

16:54.500 --> 16:56.967
YOU KNOW WHO'S CUTE?
GIANNI."

16:56.967 --> 17:02.200
- DEBRA!

17:02.200 --> 17:04.333
- SO WHAT?
I MEAN, WHAT?

17:04.333 --> 17:05.800
YOU DIDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING?

17:05.800 --> 17:09.133
- HEY, I WAS THERE,
AND I SAW YOUR WIFE FALL APART!

17:10.500 --> 17:13.333
I NEVER SAW HER LOOK LIKE THAT,
AND I'LL TELL YOU,

17:13.333 --> 17:15.533
I NEVER WANT TO SEE HER
LOOK LIKE THAT AGAIN.

17:19.667 --> 17:21.000
- YEAH?

17:22.700 --> 17:24.033
- A LITTLE.

17:27.333 --> 17:28.767
- WHAT ABOUT YOU, ROBERT?

17:28.767 --> 17:30.000
- WHAT?

17:30.000 --> 17:32.333
IT WAS NOTHING.

17:32.333 --> 17:34.867
OH, NO, NOW I REMEMBER.

17:34.867 --> 17:36.467
I WAS THINKING
WITH THAT NOSE,

17:36.467 --> 17:38.067
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
AN OPEN CASKET.

17:41.500 --> 17:42.633
- ROBERT!

17:47.633 --> 17:50.100
ON THE WAY HOME, "YOU ARE
THE SUNSHINE OF MY LIFE"

17:50.100 --> 17:51.800
CAME ON THE RADIO,
AND HE HAD TO PULL OVER.

17:51.800 --> 17:53.000
- AMY!

17:53.000 --> 17:54.600
- IT'S OKAY, HE'S YOUR BROTHER.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.667
- OH, HE IS NOT THE SUNSHINE
OF ANYTHING.

17:56.667 --> 17:57.867
WE'RE GOING.

17:57.867 --> 17:59.067
AND BY THE WAY, I PULLED OVER

17:59.067 --> 18:01.833
BECAUSE I THOUGHT I HIT A CAT!

18:01.833 --> 18:03.167
THAT'S RIGHT.

18:07.167 --> 18:08.367
- ALL RIGHT, MARIE,
LET'S GO.

18:08.367 --> 18:10.133
- NO, I CAN'T GO NOW.

18:10.133 --> 18:11.533
OH, RAYMOND.

18:11.533 --> 18:13.233
- OH, COME ON, YOU GOT
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE

18:13.233 --> 18:16.500
TO BLUBBER ALL OVER HIM.

18:16.500 --> 18:18.200
- ALL RIGHT.

18:18.200 --> 18:19.733
ALL RIGHT.

18:19.733 --> 18:21.167
NO, JUST ONE MORE!

18:27.067 --> 18:30.400
NEXT TIME THIS HAPPENS,
I GET TO BE THERE.

18:43.533 --> 18:45.233
- WHAT?

18:45.233 --> 18:46.567
- YOU LIKE ME.

18:57.833 --> 18:59.167
YOU KNOW--

19:03.600 --> 19:05.733
- WHAT, RAY?

19:08.700 --> 19:10.033
WHAT?

19:12.900 --> 19:16.000
- NOTHING, IT'S JUST--

19:21.567 --> 19:23.233
- I KNOW.

19:23.233 --> 19:25.500
YOU LIKE ME TOO.

19:30.867 --> 19:32.200
ME TOO.

19:54.100 --> 19:56.367
SO WHY ARE YOU
STILL STANDING OVER THERE?

19:56.367 --> 19:59.700
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT,
YOU WERE ALL HOT FOR ME.

20:00.767 --> 20:01.967
MAYBE I DIDN'T WAKE UP.

20:01.967 --> 20:06.200
[laughter]

20:06.200 --> 20:07.733
PLUS AFTER THIS,
WE GOT ICE CREAM.

20:14.833 --> 20:16.667
- HEY, ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS.

20:16.667 --> 20:17.933
- GOOD MORNING.

20:17.933 --> 20:19.133
all: HI, DAD.

20:19.133 --> 20:20.400
- OH, FRENCH TOAST, COOL.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.033
- YOU DON'T WANT
ANY OF THAT BATCH, RAY.

20:22.033 --> 20:23.633
I BURNED IT.
- NO, I DON'T MIND IT.

20:23.633 --> 20:25.733
- HAVE MINE, DADDY.

20:27.133 --> 20:29.133
- YOUR FATHER'S UNBELIEVABLE.

20:29.133 --> 20:30.567
- GIVE ME MY TOOLS!

20:30.567 --> 20:31.767
- NO!

20:31.767 --> 20:32.967
HE BROKE MY STOVE.

20:32.967 --> 20:34.367
- YOU ASKED ME
TO WORK ON IT!

20:34.367 --> 20:36.267
- YES, I DIDN'T TELL YOU
TO HIT IT WITH A HAMMER.

20:36.267 --> 20:39.133
- THAT STOVE'S BEEN
ASKING FOR IT FOR 35 YEARS.

20:39.133 --> 20:40.567
- I DON'T KNOW
WHERE TO EAT NOW.

20:41.700 --> 20:42.900
- GOOD MORNING, EVERYBODY.

20:42.900 --> 20:44.300
all: HEY.

20:44.300 --> 20:45.833
- HEY, WHAT DO YOU GOT THERE,
FRENCH TOAST?

20:45.833 --> 20:47.733
- NO, DON'T WORRY,
I'LL MAKE SOMETHING.

20:47.733 --> 20:48.933
all: YAY!

20:48.933 --> 20:50.467
- ALL RIGHT, SIT DOWN.

20:50.467 --> 20:52.333
- UNCLE ROBERT'S HUNGRY AND BIG,
AND IF YOU DON'T

20:52.333 --> 20:53.833
WANT TO GET EATEN,
MOVE OUT OF THE WAY

20:53.833 --> 20:56.067
- THIS ISN'T SO TERRIBLE.
- WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE?

20:56.067 --> 20:58.900
- HERE, HAVE SOME FRUIT
IN THE MEANTIME.

20:58.900 --> 21:00.933
- AHH.
WHO WANTS GRAPES?

21:00.933 --> 21:04.067
- RAY, I THINK IT'S GETTING
A LITTLE TOO CROWDED IN HERE.

21:04.067 --> 21:05.267
- YEAH, IT IS.

21:05.267 --> 21:06.667
YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:06.667 --> 21:08.567
WE NEED A BIGGER TABLE.

21:08.567 --> 21:11.833
- ALL RIGHT, WHO WOULD LIKE
SOME CHOCOLATE CHIP PANCAKES?

21:11.833 --> 21:13.867
all: ME!

21:13.867 --> 21:15.233
- YOU'RE BEING CUTE?

21:15.233 --> 21:17.300
[Raymond and Robert
argue over each other]

21:17.300 --> 21:18.800
- BY THE WAY, WHAT GOOD
WAS THAT OPERATION

21:18.800 --> 21:20.967
IF YOU STILL SOUND
EXACTLY THE SAME, HUH?

21:20.967 --> 21:22.167
- GIVE ME MY HAMMER.

21:22.167 --> 21:23.567
- I'M GLAD IT SOUNDS THE SAME.

21:23.567 --> 21:24.967
HE'S GOT A BEAUTIFUL VOICE.

21:24.967 --> 21:26.167
HE COULD HAVE BEEN A SINGER.

21:26.167 --> 21:27.567
- MA, WHERE DO YOU
COME UP WITH--

21:27.567 --> 21:28.567
- THAT'S RIGHT.

21:28.567 --> 21:30.067
HERE, THIS ONE'S
FOR YOU, ROBERT.

21:30.067 --> 21:32.633
[singing]
YOU ARE THE SUNSHINE OF MY LIFE.

21:32.633 --> 21:34.467
- ALL RIGHT, STOP IT,
PLEASE, I'M EATING.

21:34.467 --> 21:37.533
- [singing] THAT'S WHY
I'LL ALWAYS BE AROUND YOU.

21:37.533 --> 21:39.667
- HEY, DAD, HIT ME
WITH THE HAMMER!

21:39.667 --> 21:41.833
- DON'T TEASE HIM
LIKE THAT.

21:41.833 --> 21:44.933
