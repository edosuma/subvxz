00:46.588 --> 00:48.090
Hey.

00:48.090 --> 00:51.343
I was happy to hear
the Review Board cleared you.

00:51.385 --> 00:54.596
It's been a rough time,
but I'm dealing with it.

00:54.638 --> 00:58.100
Anyway, a kitchen worker
found him.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.102
Says a lot of homeless
people hang out here.

01:00.602 --> 01:03.105
Says the vic was unfamiliar to him.

01:03.105 --> 01:06.108
Creased khakis,
Oxford shirt, new shoes.

01:06.149 --> 01:08.110
This guy had a home.

01:08.110 --> 01:11.613
Well, I checked
the front pockets, no ID.

01:11.655 --> 01:12.614
Back pockets?

01:13.115 --> 01:14.116
I was leaving that for you.

01:15.117 --> 01:17.119
Looks like some blood
around his lips.

01:17.619 --> 01:19.121
Maybe somebody punched him
in the mouth.

01:19.162 --> 01:20.122
What do you think?

01:29.631 --> 01:31.884
Cranberry sauce.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.136
I know.

01:34.136 --> 01:35.637
Happy Thanksgiving.

01:43.645 --> 01:47.149
? Who... are you??

01:47.149 --> 01:50.152
? Who, who, who, who??

01:50.652 --> 01:53.155
? Who... are you??

01:53.155 --> 01:54.907
? Who, who, who, who??

01:54.948 --> 01:57.075
? I really wanna know?

01:57.117 --> 01:59.161
? Who... are you??

01:59.161 --> 02:01.663
Oh-oh-oh?
?Who...?

02:01.663 --> 02:04.666
? Come on, tell me who are you,
you, you?

02:04.708 --> 02:06.668
? Oh, you!?

02:15.677 --> 02:18.680
This place used to make a hell
of a meatloaf sandwich.

02:18.722 --> 02:20.182
You ever eat here?

02:20.182 --> 02:22.684
Not since the chef blew his
brains all over the kitchen.

02:22.726 --> 02:24.186
I eat here all the time.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.188
I like the chili.

02:29.191 --> 02:30.192
T.O.D., David?

02:30.234 --> 02:31.193
Based on liver temp,

02:31.193 --> 02:32.694
he's been dead around two hours.

02:32.694 --> 02:37.199
Looks like he was knocked out
and thrown out.

02:37.199 --> 02:44.206
And there's some metallic
silver residue on his cheek.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.711
What's this gunk in his hands?

02:53.215 --> 02:55.217
Mashed potatoes.

02:55.217 --> 02:57.219
There were mashed potatoes
in the Dumpster.

02:58.720 --> 03:02.724
No fingernails...
on either hand.

03:04.726 --> 03:07.229
Maybe he was alive inside there.

03:07.729 --> 03:09.231
Digging to get out.

03:09.231 --> 03:11.733
Or he had really bad
table manners.

03:15.237 --> 03:20.242
There's some scarring on h
is wrist, but not on the other.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.246
Look what I found in his pocket.

03:24.746 --> 03:27.249
"Aunt Jackpot's Pretzels

03:27.249 --> 03:29.251
Oh, now, they make
a great pretzel.

03:29.251 --> 03:31.253
Maybe that's why he's
got that smile on his face.

03:43.265 --> 03:44.766
419 times two.

03:44.808 --> 03:46.268
Double murder?

03:46.768 --> 03:47.769
Husband and wife.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.771
Beat-up car in a Lexus
neighborhood.

03:50.272 --> 03:51.773
We ran the plates.
R.O. doesn't live here.

03:52.274 --> 03:53.775
We're tracking her down.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.277
"Bitch on Wheels. "

03:55.277 --> 03:57.279
Can't wait to meet her.

04:00.282 --> 04:03.785
Alarm was triggered
at 11:45 p. m.

04:04.286 --> 04:07.289
The monitoring company
notified P.D.

04:07.289 --> 04:08.790
when the homeowners didn't
return their call.

04:09.291 --> 04:12.294
Patrol finally arrived
at 3:32 a. m.

04:12.336 --> 04:13.837
Residentials are a low priority.

04:13.879 --> 04:15.297
They're usually false alarms

04:15.339 --> 04:16.798
Not this one.

04:16.798 --> 04:19.301
Michael and Lori Tinsley.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.303
Kitchen door was open
when we arrived.

04:21.345 --> 04:22.804
His wallet was in his pocket.

04:23.305 --> 04:25.807
Her purse was on the counter.

04:25.807 --> 04:29.811
Cards, cash, TV, stereo,
it's all still here.

04:29.811 --> 04:33.815
If this was a robbery,
they missed all the good stuff

04:33.857 --> 04:35.317
The coroner should be here
right now.

04:35.317 --> 04:37.819
So, uh, I'm gonna go see
what's happened to him.

04:40.822 --> 04:44.826
Well, looks like she
exsanguinated out her jugular.

04:44.868 --> 04:47.829
Abrasion on his forehead.

04:47.871 --> 04:49.331
No visible blood.

04:49.331 --> 04:51.583
Blonde hairs on his shirt.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.836
Both victims are brunette.

04:54.336 --> 04:57.339
Blonde hairs on the wife, too.

04:57.840 --> 05:02.344
And possible skin scrapings
under her fingernails.

05:02.386 --> 05:04.346
Maybe she got a piece
of her attacker.

05:10.853 --> 05:12.855
If her neck was sliced
with a knife,

05:12.896 --> 05:14.356
it was probably serrated.

05:14.356 --> 05:16.358
The wound's too jagged
for a straight one.

05:18.360 --> 05:21.363
Check out that record
collection.

05:21.405 --> 05:22.865
The cabinet door's open.

05:27.870 --> 05:28.871
Alphabetized.

05:29.371 --> 05:31.373
Classic rock.

05:33.876 --> 05:37.379
Looks like several records
have been removed recently.

05:44.887 --> 05:46.388
I'll dust for prints.

05:46.889 --> 05:48.891
Smudges in the blood trail.

05:48.891 --> 05:52.895
Ovoid shapes suggest
directionality.

05:53.395 --> 05:58.650
Satellite stains also suggest
suspect moved this direction.

05:58.692 --> 06:03.906
Judging by these gaps, I'd s
ay entire catalogs are missing.

06:03.947 --> 06:05.908
There is good money in vinyl.

06:05.908 --> 06:08.660
Especially if it's rare
and well-preserved.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.413
Who would kill somebody
over a bunch of records?

06:11.413 --> 06:14.416
Something's missing between
the Beach Boys and Billy Joel.

06:14.917 --> 06:16.418
The Beatles.

06:22.925 --> 06:24.927
Loose strike.

06:25.427 --> 06:27.930
Would have been pretty easy
to get in from back here.

06:29.932 --> 06:31.934
They have a dog.

06:32.434 --> 06:34.937
Sofia said the door was open;
maybe he took off.

06:35.437 --> 06:37.940
Blood stains s
top at the grass.

06:38.440 --> 06:38.941
Sprinklers are on now,

06:39.441 --> 06:41.443
kissing the evidence good-bye.

06:41.485 --> 06:43.445
Hey, Nick. Yeah?

06:43.445 --> 06:45.948
There is some blood
on these dog bowls.

06:51.453 --> 06:51.954
Considerable.

07:46.508 --> 07:49.511
I'll call Animal Control

07:49.511 --> 07:51.013
Stomach is massively distended.

07:51.013 --> 07:53.515
Human stomachs have a volume
of about one liter,

07:53.557 --> 07:55.017
a little more than a quart.

07:55.517 --> 07:57.519
and But they have the ability to exp

07:57.561 --> 07:58.812
and hold up to four liters.

07:58.854 --> 08:00.022
But looking at this guy,

08:00.022 --> 08:02.524
I'd say he was pac
king around six.

08:02.566 --> 08:04.026
And that's your COD.

08:07.529 --> 08:11.033
Asphyxia due to mechanical
compression of the lungs

08:11.074 --> 08:13.076
due to gastric dilatation.

08:13.118 --> 08:15.037
His stomach expanded,

08:15.037 --> 08:16.538
leaving no room
for the organs

08:16.538 --> 08:20.042
It's going to keep me on my diet
for a couple more weeks.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.543
Let's take a look.

08:25.047 --> 08:27.549
Ooh, the guy
was a walking buffet.

08:28.050 --> 08:29.551
Multiple contusions.

08:29.551 --> 08:32.554
He's got a band of dead tissue
on his wrist.

08:33.054 --> 08:35.557
No fingernails.

08:35.557 --> 08:38.059
Cuticle's are inflamed
and still intact.

08:38.101 --> 08:39.102
They weren't pulled off.

08:39.144 --> 08:40.062
They were bitten down...

08:42.063 --> 08:44.066
At first I thought
tortured and force fed,

08:44.066 --> 08:46.318
but the usual signs of force
feeding are absent.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.570
No abrasions on the mucosal
surface of the lips.

08:49.071 --> 08:51.573
No aspirated food
in the airways.

08:51.615 --> 08:53.075
So what are you thinking now?

08:54.576 --> 08:56.578
He ate himself to death.

09:03.585 --> 09:05.087
Oh, I know exactly who that is.

09:05.128 --> 09:06.588
Man, dude's crazy.

09:06.630 --> 09:07.589
Dude got a name?

09:07.589 --> 09:09.591
No name.
Oh, but I got a wallet.

09:09.633 --> 09:11.593
What, he left it behind?

09:12.094 --> 09:13.095
More like he threw it.

09:13.595 --> 09:15.597
Hey. Watch it.

09:15.597 --> 09:16.598
Pretzel, thank you, please

09:16.640 --> 09:17.599
Hey, pal.

09:18.100 --> 09:19.101
Where's your manners?

09:19.101 --> 09:21.103
Just one pretzel, please.
Just a quick, fast one.

09:21.144 --> 09:22.104
Come on.
No, no.

09:22.104 --> 09:25.107
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
I said no!

09:25.148 --> 09:25.607
Excuse me.

09:26.108 --> 09:28.360
See, salty pretzel's $1.50.

09:28.402 --> 09:30.612
Only a dollar in the wallet.

09:31.113 --> 09:32.614
Jerk.

09:32.614 --> 09:35.117
Hey, and I took the money, by the way.

09:35.158 --> 09:36.410
I didn't care.

09:36.451 --> 09:37.619
Oh, I saw that

09:37.619 --> 09:39.121
Sports Promotions.

09:39.121 --> 09:41.123
Man, I see n his gut, man.

09:41.123 --> 09:43.125
He don't look
like he no athlete

09:43.125 --> 09:45.627
They're calling poker players
athletes these days.

09:45.669 --> 09:47.129
Seen the guts on them?

09:47.629 --> 09:49.631
Hey, can I get
a pineapple cinnamon?

09:50.132 --> 09:51.633
Oh, okay, good choice.

09:51.633 --> 09:53.635
Thank you.

09:56.138 --> 09:59.641
O198. Please leave your message
after the tone.

10:03.145 --> 10:07.649
All right, let's take
a look at our Cujo.

10:15.157 --> 10:17.659
Yeah, she's ferocious.

10:17.659 --> 10:19.661
Yeah, yeah, I'm petrified.

10:19.661 --> 10:21.663
So what's the outside chan
ce of rabies?

10:21.705 --> 10:24.458
She's not salivating excessively

10:24.500 --> 10:27.169
or showing any signs
of hydrophobia,

10:27.169 --> 10:28.670
but rabies doesn't
present immediately.

10:28.670 --> 10:30.672
She'll be quarantined
for the next ten days.

10:30.714 --> 10:32.174
Well, other than rabies,

10:32.174 --> 10:34.176
what would make a dog
attack its owner?

10:34.218 --> 10:35.177
Abuse?

10:35.177 --> 10:38.180
Abused animals
may turn violent.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.682
Head traumas may induce
unprovoked aggression.

10:40.724 --> 10:42.726
And there's always
springer rage.

10:42.768 --> 10:44.686
Yeah, yeah,
I hate that show, too.

10:46.688 --> 10:49.191
It's a form of epilepsy
associated with several breeds,

10:49.233 --> 10:51.693
including springers
and retrievers.

10:51.693 --> 10:54.696
Man's best friend will back you
into a corner and attack.

10:54.738 --> 10:56.198
Five minutes later,

10:56.198 --> 10:58.200
she's licking your face
as if nothing ever happened.

11:01.203 --> 11:02.704
I suppose you want
bite impressions?

11:03.205 --> 11:05.207
Yeah, I'll prep the microsil,
if you prep the pooch.

11:05.249 --> 11:08.710
This car is registered
to you, Ms. Halter?

11:08.752 --> 11:10.712
So?
Yeah.

11:10.712 --> 11:13.215
And why was it
in the Tinsleys' driveway?

11:13.215 --> 11:15.217
shop. I lent it to Michael;
his Beemer's in the

11:15.717 --> 11:16.718
I want it back

11:16.718 --> 11:18.720
This was not meant
for public transit

11:18.720 --> 11:23.725
And your relationship
with Michael Tinsley is?

11:23.767 --> 11:25.727
Why is that an y of your business?

11:27.229 --> 11:28.730
I'm his girlfriend, okay?

11:28.730 --> 11:30.732
How does his wife
feel about that?

11:30.774 --> 11:32.734
Not my problem

11:32.734 --> 11:34.236
They're separated,
getting divorced

11:34.278 --> 11:36.238
Michael lives with me.

11:36.238 --> 11:39.241
I want to talk
to Michael now

11:39.241 --> 11:41.743
Were you at Lori Tinsley's
house last night?

11:41.743 --> 11:46.248
No. I've never been in
side that psuedo Cape Cod dump.

11:46.290 --> 11:47.249
If you've never been there,

11:47.749 --> 11:49.751
then how do you know it's
a pseudo Cape Cod dump?

11:49.793 --> 11:51.753
I know her taste.

11:51.753 --> 11:54.756
Well, your fingerprints
were at the scene.

11:54.756 --> 11:57.759
In fact, you helped yourself
to the record collection.

11:57.801 --> 11:59.761
That's why I'm here?

12:00.262 --> 12:01.763
Because you think
I stole some albums?

12:02.264 --> 12:03.265
What did Michael tell you?

12:03.307 --> 12:04.766
Not much.

12:05.267 --> 12:08.270
Look, he said Lori was planning
on selling his vinyls.

12:08.312 --> 12:11.273
So, last week, when she
was out and he was at work,

12:11.773 --> 12:12.774
he gave me the keys,

12:12.774 --> 12:14.776
the alarm code
and a list of albums

12:14.818 --> 12:16.278
he couldn't live without.

12:29.291 --> 12:31.793
Michael's owned those records
since high school.

12:31.835 --> 12:34.588
He has the White Album,
autographed by Paul McCartney.

12:34.630 --> 12:37.466
And he didn't break into
the house himself because...

12:37.508 --> 12:40.302
Because he needed an alibi
in case Lori pressed charges.

12:40.344 --> 12:42.346
Look, I am trying to be helpful here,

12:42.387 --> 12:44.097
but I'm not sa
ying another word

12:44.139 --> 12:45.724
until you let me
talk to Michael.

12:45.766 --> 12:47.309
You have the right
to remain silent,

12:47.309 --> 12:51.313
but Michael Tinsley
and Lori Tinsley are dead.

13:42.865 --> 13:44.366
Oh, nice look.

13:44.366 --> 13:46.618
That'll guarantee
you the chicks

13:46.660 --> 13:49.037
Silvery material
on your vic's face

13:49.079 --> 13:51.248
was Graftobian
theatrical makeup.

13:51.248 --> 13:53.375
Moonlight Silver is the color.

13:54.376 --> 13:55.878
Okay, look.

13:55.878 --> 13:58.380
I can't stand
the smell of hot dogs.

13:58.422 --> 13:59.381
They make me sick.

13:59.381 --> 14:02.885
So, all this stuff
was in the vic's stomach

14:03.385 --> 14:03.886
Among other things.

14:04.386 --> 14:06.388
You know what the worst
kind of burp is?

14:06.430 --> 14:07.389
Hot dog burp.

14:07.389 --> 14:09.892
You know, like your dad's
just letting them loose,

14:09.933 --> 14:11.894
or maybe the ex-girlfriend.

14:14.897 --> 14:19.401
Well, as you can see,
he wasn't much of a chewer,

14:19.902 --> 14:20.903
which was very lucky for us.

14:20.903 --> 14:22.654
Made it easier
to identify the food.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.406
Cake, mac and cheese,
pretzels, pasta,

14:24.907 --> 14:27.910
beef, shrimp, fish and,
of course, hot dogs.

14:29.912 --> 14:31.914
Food normally takes two
to four hours to digest,

14:32.414 --> 14:33.916
which means he
ate all of this.

14:33.916 --> 14:37.419
In two to four hours
before he died.

14:37.461 --> 14:39.922
How many hot dogs did he eat?

14:39.963 --> 14:41.924
Approximately 20.

14:41.965 --> 14:43.926
God, ugh.

14:43.926 --> 14:47.930
Do you think we might be able
to ID the makers of the hot dogs

14:47.971 --> 14:49.431
from the ingredien
No.

14:49.431 --> 14:51.183
Believe it or not,
most hot dog companies

14:51.225 --> 14:52.935
are very proprietary
over their recipes.

14:53.435 --> 14:55.437
Well, how about through
the griddle marks?

14:55.479 --> 14:57.439
Oh, yeah, sure.
I'll just run it

14:57.439 --> 14:59.441
through the Hot Dog
Appliance database.

15:03.946 --> 15:07.449
When was the last time you saw
a branded logo on a hot dog?

15:07.950 --> 15:10.452
Looks like those
novelty chatter teeth.

15:10.494 --> 15:11.453
Weird.

15:11.453 --> 15:13.455
You think
that's weird?

15:13.497 --> 15:14.957
Check this out.

15:15.457 --> 15:16.458
This was in his stomach, too.

15:28.971 --> 15:30.973
"Circus Town Buffet."

15:31.014 --> 15:33.475
"All-U-Can-Eat. "

15:45.988 --> 15:47.739
I know exactly
who that is.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.491
How could I
forget him?

15:52.494 --> 15:53.996
He didn't even wait
to sit down.

16:03.505 --> 16:05.507
Hi, we've got a problem.

16:06.008 --> 16:08.010
Hurry up before the food's gone.

16:08.510 --> 16:10.012
I called Secur ity to kick him out.

16:10.053 --> 16:11.513
When they arrived,
he was gone.

16:11.555 --> 16:13.015
Kick him out?

16:13.015 --> 16:15.517
Sign outside says,
"All-U-Can-Eat. "

16:15.559 --> 16:18.020
Look, he was taking
it a little too far.

16:18.061 --> 16:19.521
Well, he paid, didn't he?

16:19.563 --> 16:21.023
Yeah, cash

16:21.023 --> 16:22.524
So he still
had his wallet.

16:22.524 --> 16:25.027
Do you have any surveillance
on your register?

16:25.068 --> 16:26.570
For the $1.99 buffet?

16:26.612 --> 16:28.030
That would be a no

16:28.530 --> 16:32.284
And are those the only
hot dogs that you serve?

16:32.326 --> 16:36.038
Yeah, we're famous
for our cocktail wieners.

16:36.079 --> 16:37.039
You should try one

16:37.039 --> 16:39.541
I think we need a couple
of cocktails first.

16:39.583 --> 16:42.044
DNA confirmed all the blood
at the crime scene

16:42.085 --> 16:43.045
is Lora Tinsley's.

16:43.045 --> 16:45.047
Sofia talked to their divorce lawyers.

16:45.047 --> 16:46.548
Michael and Lori were
fighting over everything

16:47.049 --> 16:48.550
the house, the cars,
her jewelry.

16:48.550 --> 16:51.053
When she found out that he
was stealing his stuff back,

16:51.094 --> 16:52.846
she had the locks and
the alarm codes changed.

16:52.888 --> 16:54.556
Well, Michael did send
his girlfriend Missy over

16:55.057 --> 16:56.058
to retrieve his vinyls,

16:56.058 --> 16:57.559
but last night
he broke in himself,

16:58.060 --> 16:59.061
not to mention she was home.

16:59.061 --> 17:01.063
That's kind of asking
for trouble, isn't it?

17:01.104 --> 17:02.564
Yeah, divo rce is war, huh?

17:03.065 --> 17:04.066
Sure glad I don't have that problem.

17:04.107 --> 17:05.567
Yeah, me either.
Hodges.

17:05.567 --> 17:07.569
I'm not done with
your samples, okay

17:07.569 --> 17:10.071
And I just received the
fingernail scrapings.

17:10.113 --> 17:12.074
Well, I sent
the scrapings to DNA.

17:12.115 --> 17:14.076
DNA kicked them over to me.

17:14.576 --> 17:16.078
There were no biologicals
in the sample.

17:16.118 --> 17:17.579
Have you process
ed the hairs yet?

17:18.079 --> 17:20.082
That, I have done.

17:20.082 --> 17:22.584
All the hairs lifted
off the victims' clothes

17:22.626 --> 17:24.086
were consistent with each other.

17:24.586 --> 17:26.088
There's a sample
under the scope.

17:27.589 --> 17:30.592
Root is shaped like a spade
which is indicative of canine,

17:31.093 --> 17:32.094
and the scale pattern

17:32.094 --> 17:34.096
is consistent with
a golden retriever.

17:34.096 --> 17:36.598
Oh, yeah, the victims
have a golden retriever.

17:36.598 --> 17:38.600
Well, if you'd cracked
that mystery at the scene,

17:38.642 --> 17:40.102
you would've saved me
a lot of time.

17:41.103 --> 17:42.855
I've been working like a dog

17:42.896 --> 17:44.606
You know, studies have found

17:45.107 --> 17:46.608
that pet owners have
lower stress levels.

17:47.109 --> 17:48.861
You should check that out.

17:48.902 --> 17:50.612
Well, I had hamsters growing up.

17:51.113 --> 17:52.114
My mother hated them.

17:52.114 --> 17:53.615
She said
they stank up my room,

17:53.615 --> 17:56.618
but I just loved to watch them
spinning on their little wheels.

17:56.660 --> 18:00.164
One day I came home
and they were gone.

18:00.205 --> 18:03.167
Somehow they'd gotten
out of their cage.

18:03.208 --> 18:06.128
How much did y our mother hate them?

18:06.170 --> 18:08.130
They ran away.

19:32.714 --> 19:35.217
Michael Tinsley was shot?

19:35.217 --> 19:37.219
Yeah, the bullet penetrated
the base of the brain

19:37.261 --> 19:39.012
and lodged
in the occipital lobe.

19:39.054 --> 19:40.722
The hemorrhage
was intracranial.

19:40.764 --> 19:42.724
Looks like a.22 caliber.

19:42.724 --> 19:45.727
Yeah, the scalp abrasion
was probably incidental.

19:46.228 --> 19:49.731
We did not check the house for
GSR; we didn't know he was shot.

19:49.773 --> 19:50.732
That's understandable-

19:50.732 --> 19:52.734
the entry wound wasn't visible

19:52.776 --> 19:53.235
but check this out.

19:57.739 --> 20:00.742
Some people will put
anything up their nose.

20:02.244 --> 20:05.247
So, Michael Tinsley breaks
into his own house,

20:05.747 --> 20:08.750
the alarm goes off,
all hell breaks loose.

20:08.792 --> 20:11.753
She shoots him, the bullet
goes up his nose,

20:12.254 --> 20:13.255
and then what?

20:13.255 --> 20:15.757
Kahlua freaks and rips
out the wife's throat?

20:16.258 --> 20:19.761
It's possible, which is
another reason I prefer cats.

20:19.803 --> 20:22.764
The Tinsleys d ied at home... alone.

20:23.265 --> 20:25.767
So, where's the gun?

20:33.984 --> 20:36.486
I went shopping.

20:36.987 --> 20:39.489
Bought every brand of hot dog
for sale in Las Vegas.

20:39.531 --> 20:40.949
Who's paying for it?

20:40.991 --> 20:42.993
You mean the lab's
not going to reimburse me?

20:43.035 --> 20:44.953
No.

20:44.995 --> 20:47.498
Well, I couldn't identif
y the chatter teeth logo,

20:47.539 --> 20:50.000
so I figured I could
physically match one of these

20:50.501 --> 20:52.503
to the one found in the
victim's stomach, you know

20:53.003 --> 20:55.506
Maybe comparing
that twisty thing at the end.

20:56.006 --> 20:57.508
Sounds like a good idea, Greg.

20:58.008 --> 20:59.468
I'm still not paying for it.

20:59.510 --> 21:02.513
Fine- guess I'll just eat h
otdogs for the rest of the year.

21:02.554 --> 21:03.972
"A hot dog at the ballpark

21:04.014 --> 21:06.475
tastes better
than a steak at the Ritz. "

21:06.517 --> 21:09.019
Well, I can tell when
you're quoting something

21:09.061 --> 21:10.020
Who said it?

21:10.521 --> 21:11.522
Humphrey Bogart.

21:11.563 --> 21:12.981
Mm.

21:13.023 --> 21:14.525
Did you know
that the term "hot dog"

21:14.566 --> 21:15.984
was actually coined
at a baseball game?

21:16.026 --> 21:20.531
New York Polo Grounds,
somewhere around 1867.

21:20.572 --> 21:21.990
A German butcher was selling

21:22.032 --> 21:25.035
what he called "dachshund
sausages" out of his pie wagon.

21:25.077 --> 21:26.036
He put them on a roll,

21:26.537 --> 21:28.038
s. so that his customers
wouldn't burn their finger

21:28.080 --> 21:30.040
He'd yell out
"Get your dachshund sausages,

21:30.082 --> 21:32.501
they're red hot!"

21:32.543 --> 21:35.045
Soon, all the vendors at the Polo
Grounds were selling them, too

21:35.546 --> 21:37.047
But they were too lazy to say
"dachshund sausages,"

21:37.089 --> 21:39.800
so they just called them
"hot dogs. "

21:39.842 --> 21:41.927
Now there's over
50 major brands.

21:41.969 --> 21:44.054
Good luck.
I'm rooting for you.

21:44.555 --> 21:47.057
Well, hopefully I find a wiener.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.101
Gut check, one, two!

22:31.143 --> 22:32.102
Gut check!

22:32.603 --> 22:34.605
Ladies and gentlemen!

22:35.105 --> 22:37.065
Time for the bib sheets.

22:37.107 --> 22:38.066
Today's match will include

22:38.108 --> 22:41.111
some of the most famous
gurgitators in the sport.

22:41.153 --> 22:43.113
Let's start with
one of the finest:

22:43.614 --> 22:45.574
The godfather of the sport
has a mouth so big

22:45.616 --> 22:49.620
he speaks in Surround Sound,
ladies and gentlemen.

22:49.661 --> 22:53.624
Three-time lasagna-eating
champion Antonio Colletti.

22:53.665 --> 22:55.626
Patty Cake, Patty Cake,
baker's man,

22:56.126 --> 22:58.086
she can eat a cake
faster than anyone can.

22:58.128 --> 23:00.631
Current cupcake champion and the
most elegant eater in the sport,

23:00.672 --> 23:03.091
Patty "Cake" Newton.

23:03.133 --> 23:05.093
Our most vocal gurgitator...

23:05.135 --> 23:08.639
There's the chatter teeth logo

23:08.680 --> 23:10.140
EXEF

23:10.641 --> 23:13.143
Wasn't that the name
on the business card

23:13.185 --> 23:14.603
you found in the vic's wallet?

23:14.645 --> 23:17.147
I think we just found
our Digger James.

23:17.648 --> 23:20.400
...he's said to have
two stomachs!

23:20.442 --> 23:23.153
Undisputed popcorn shrimp
champion,

23:23.195 --> 23:25.155
James "Spare Tank" Patterson.

23:27.658 --> 23:30.160
And finally,
known for his jaw strength,

23:30.661 --> 23:33.914
trains with his pit bulls,
three-time rib champion-

23:33.956 --> 23:37.167
today he will be wearing
the EXEF hot dog camera-

23:37.209 --> 23:41.171
Marty Mayron,
"The Meat Machine!"

23:44.675 --> 23:46.677
All right, gurgitators,
you have 12 minutes

23:46.718 --> 23:51.181
to eat your way into history.

23:51.682 --> 23:54.184
They're diving
straight in there.

23:54.226 --> 23:56.645
Marty Mayron going
with the Japanese,

23:56.687 --> 23:59.189
dipping his bun in lemonade
to make it go down easier

23:59.231 --> 24:02.192
and then biting that hot dog
into little pieces.

24:02.693 --> 24:06.697
Not to be outdone, Miomoto going
for the double Japanese.

24:06.738 --> 24:08.156
Colletti, the old pro,

24:08.198 --> 24:09.950
double fisting it,
double dunking it.

24:09.992 --> 24:11.660
That is a Heimlich
waiting to happen.

24:11.702 --> 24:14.204
... is not fooling around
- he's doing a reverse Japanese:

24:14.246 --> 24:16.707
Bun first,
hot dog afterwards.

24:16.748 --> 24:19.209
Sort of a "dachshund chaser. "

24:19.710 --> 24:20.669
Still pushing it,
going old school,

24:20.711 --> 24:23.213
like a little kid trying
to impress his grandmother

24:23.255 --> 24:25.674
at Thanksgiving dinner.

24:25.716 --> 24:28.719
Patty Cake going mostly cakey
on that one.

24:28.760 --> 24:31.722
You can almost see the icing
on that hot dog.

24:32.222 --> 24:33.223
Colletti having a bit
of a problem.

24:33.724 --> 24:35.726
Something's slowing him down

24:35.767 --> 24:36.685
Whoa!

24:36.727 --> 24:38.228
Antonio Colletti,

24:38.729 --> 24:40.230
a reversal of fortune.

24:40.731 --> 24:42.691
That's an immediate
disqualification,

24:42.733 --> 24:45.736
and, of course, disgusting
for all of us to watch.

24:45.777 --> 24:47.696
Wow.

24:47.738 --> 24:49.198
Well, which one
do you want?

24:49.239 --> 24:53.243
The guy in the silver
face paint or Digger James

24:53.285 --> 24:54.995
I don't know-
slimy stuff is your thing.

24:55.037 --> 24:56.747
I don't want
to get mustard on my suit.

24:56.788 --> 24:58.499
I'll take Digger.

24:58.540 --> 25:00.250
Do I have a choice?

25:02.753 --> 25:04.505
Hey, you recognize this guy?

25:04.546 --> 25:06.256
That's Jerry.

25:06.757 --> 25:09.760
By far, one of the best walk-on
gurgitators I've ever seen.

25:09.801 --> 25:11.762
So you gave him your
business card, right?

25:11.803 --> 25:13.764
I'm the US rep
for the EXEF.

25:14.264 --> 25:15.265
All right, EXEF-

25:15.766 --> 25:17.726
what exactly
does that stand for?

25:17.768 --> 25:19.728
It's the Extre me Eating Federation.

25:19.770 --> 25:22.272
We're one of the most po
pular leagues in the sport.

25:22.314 --> 25:24.775
Pounding down hot dogs,
that's a sport?

25:24.816 --> 25:26.235
Since the early days of man.

25:26.276 --> 25:29.279
You got 30 Neanderthals in
a cave and a rabbit walks in,

25:29.321 --> 25:31.281
you have a competitive eating
situation, my friend.

25:31.782 --> 25:33.283
We have rules, records,
prize money.

25:33.784 --> 25:34.743
Some of our top
competitors earn

25:34.785 --> 25:36.787
up to a half a milli
on dollars a year.

25:36.829 --> 25:37.788
We're on cable.

25:37.830 --> 25:39.248
No kidding.

25:39.289 --> 25:41.291
Well, what does all this
have to do with Jerry?

25:41.333 --> 25:42.751
Everything.

25:42.793 --> 25:45.546
Jerry had undeniable
gastro-intestinal fortitude.

25:45.587 --> 25:48.257
He took third in
yesterday's competition.

25:48.298 --> 25:50.300
That qualifies him for
the finals in Atlantic City.

25:50.342 --> 25:52.803
It made theLas VegasPost.
Hm.

25:52.845 --> 25:54.304
Sports section.

25:58.809 --> 26:01.311
Jerry Gable,
pounding those dogs.

26:04.314 --> 26:06.817
Third place goes to a walk-on.

26:06.859 --> 26:09.319
An amazing job-
Jerry Gable.

26:16.326 --> 26:18.078
Can I keep this?

26:18.120 --> 26:19.788
Sure.
Thanks.

26:19.830 --> 26:21.582
I'm telling you,
with proper training,

26:21.623 --> 26:23.292
Jerry could've proudly
represented the US.

26:23.333 --> 26:26.336
and taken back the Golden Weenie
from the Japanese Champion.

26:26.378 --> 26:28.297
Yeah, got to get
that Golden Weenie back.

26:28.338 --> 26:31.592
Uh, so after the tournament,
did you see Jerry?

26:31.633 --> 26:34.845
Paid him, gave him my card,
left him to celebrate.

26:34.887 --> 26:36.847
Any idea who
he was celebrating with?

26:38.348 --> 26:40.601
You want a sam ple of my face paint?

26:40.642 --> 26:42.853
Yeah, it's part of
my investigation.

26:42.895 --> 26:44.354
Oh, it's still moist.

26:44.396 --> 26:45.856
That's good for me.

26:46.356 --> 26:48.859
I didn't do anything
to Jerry Gable.

26:49.359 --> 26:50.819
Okay, in the beginning,

26:50.861 --> 26:53.363
I admit I was a little pee'd off

26:53.405 --> 26:55.115
that I lost to the guy

26:55.157 --> 26:56.825
But then I learned

26:56.867 --> 26:58.869
what a disturbed individual he was.

26:59.369 --> 27:00.329
Couple more!

27:00.370 --> 27:03.373
Just, just, just, just,
a couple... couple more!

27:03.874 --> 27:06.376
Has anybody got more hot dogs?

27:06.418 --> 27:07.336
Please!

27:07.377 --> 27:08.879
What are you trying
to prove, huh?

27:08.921 --> 27:10.339
Just give me more!

27:10.380 --> 27:12.883
Trying to be a big guy,
tough guy, huh?

27:12.925 --> 27:15.385
Please, please!

27:16.887 --> 27:20.849
And what happened
after the friendly hug?

27:20.891 --> 27:22.893
Some guy in a hat came by,
took him out of here.

27:25.896 --> 27:27.898
Is that the guy in the hat?

27:27.940 --> 27:29.900
Sure is.

28:55.986 --> 28:57.946
So I found t he murder weapon.

28:57.988 --> 28:59.990
It slipped under
the living room couch-

29:00.032 --> 29:01.950
presumably when Kahlua attacked Lori.

29:01.992 --> 29:05.496
Well, a dog did attack Lori,
but it wasn't Kahlua.

29:05.537 --> 29:06.955
The bite marks
on Lori's neck

29:06.997 --> 29:09.249
are inconsistent
with Kahlua's teeth.

29:09.291 --> 29:11.502
Oh, which means Kahlua
gets to walk.

29:11.543 --> 29:15.005
Check out this left canine.

29:17.007 --> 29:19.009
The tooth is chipped.

29:19.510 --> 29:21.512
All the dog hair we found
at the crime scene

29:21.553 --> 29:22.513
was consistent with
a golden retriever,

29:22.554 --> 29:24.264
which suggests
there was another

29:24.306 --> 29:25.974
golden retriever in the house.

29:26.016 --> 29:29.019
It could've attacked Lori,
fled out the kitchen door.

29:29.061 --> 29:32.022
That is like saying
there's a second shooter

29:32.064 --> 29:35.025
on the grassy knoll-
they only had one dog, Nick.

29:35.067 --> 29:36.485
I'm calling Animal Control

29:36.527 --> 29:38.529
We're looking for
another golden retriever,

29:39.029 --> 29:41.031
one with a bad tooth
and rotten disposition.

29:53.043 --> 29:55.045
Little late to be
going to court.

29:55.546 --> 29:57.506
No, I'm not going to court

29:57.548 --> 30:00.551
I'm taking my lady Tina to that
new Cirque show at the Wynn

30:00.592 --> 30:02.511
and I forgot my tickets
in my locker.

30:02.553 --> 30:04.054
That's nice, but if you're
looking for something

30:04.555 --> 30:06.557
to tide you over,
look no further.

30:10.060 --> 30:11.520
Busy night.

30:11.562 --> 30:14.565
Figured the lab could use
a little lovin' from the oven.

30:15.065 --> 30:16.567
Oh, your wife made a pie.

30:17.067 --> 30:19.319
I made the pie.

30:19.361 --> 30:21.196
Strawberry rhubarb.

30:21.238 --> 30:23.073
I'm impressed.

30:25.576 --> 30:27.077
Let's take it easy with
the cutting there, Doc,

30:27.578 --> 30:29.079
it's starting to look li
ke the hit-and-run

30:29.580 --> 30:30.581
on your table last week.

30:30.622 --> 30:31.582
Just try it.

30:31.623 --> 30:33.041
Thanks.

30:33.083 --> 30:34.585
You know, it's vegan.

30:34.626 --> 30:36.086
Low fat, low sugar,

30:36.128 --> 30:37.087
low carb.

30:37.588 --> 30:38.589
Low taste.

30:40.090 --> 30:41.842
Catherine, Catherine, come here.

30:41.884 --> 30:43.594
I need your opinion on this.

30:47.598 --> 30:49.099
Try this.

30:49.600 --> 30:52.603
t. No, thank you, I just came from
Nel's Hot Dog Eating Tournamen

30:52.644 --> 30:55.105
I'm really done
with food. It's good.

30:55.147 --> 30:56.565
I was watching tha
t on cable.

30:56.607 --> 30:59.109
Some Japanese guy ate,
like, 64 hot dogs

30:59.151 --> 31:01.069
in 12 minutes.
Yeah.

31:01.111 --> 31:03.113
He's was the mos t famous
guy in Japa n behind Yao Ming.

31:03.155 --> 31:05.073
Yao Ming is Chinese.
Try it.

31:05.115 --> 31:06.617
They ought to make it
an Olympic sport or something.

31:07.117 --> 31:08.619
Please?

31:09.119 --> 31:10.579
No, I can't go there.
I can't.

31:10.621 --> 31:12.623
You know, if you want to
cleanse your taste buds,

31:12.664 --> 31:15.125
pie. I suggest you try Doc Robbins'

31:15.167 --> 31:16.585
Really

31:16.627 --> 31:17.628
Yeah, that's why
you're leaving it behind

31:23.133 --> 31:25.594
I got an ID
on Dumpster guy.

31:25.636 --> 31:28.138
Brass is tracking down
a current address.

31:28.639 --> 31:29.640
Prader-Willi.

31:30.140 --> 31:32.643
No, his name was Jerry Gable.

31:32.684 --> 31:35.103
No, Prader-Willi Syndrome.

31:35.145 --> 31:37.648
A rare gentic disorder
that causes ceaseless,

31:37.689 --> 31:40.609
uncontrollable
excruciating hunger.

31:40.651 --> 31:43.654
It's as if your stomach
was truly a bottomless pit.

31:43.695 --> 31:47.658
That could explain why
after consuming 22 dogs,

31:47.699 --> 31:49.159
he wanted more.

31:49.660 --> 31:51.662
Could also explain why he was
found in the Dumpster.

31:51.703 --> 31:53.121
He followed the food.

31:53.163 --> 31:55.165
Prader-Willi Syndrome is
characterized by short stature,

31:55.207 --> 31:57.668
hypotonia, almond-shaped eyes,

31:57.709 --> 32:00.128
and obsessive fingernail biting.

32:00.170 --> 32:02.172
That kind of fits
the victim's description

32:02.673 --> 32:05.175
Sufferers are born with
a flawed hypothalamus.

32:05.676 --> 32:07.678
Normal hypothalamus receives
a signal from the stomach-

32:07.719 --> 32:09.555
"I'm full, stop eating. "

32:14.685 --> 32:16.645
But with Prader-Willi Syndrome,

32:16.687 --> 32:19.189
the signal never reaches
the brain.

32:32.703 --> 32:35.164
They're always hungry.

32:35.205 --> 32:37.708
Like having a full tank of gas,
and gauge is stuck on empty.

32:37.749 --> 32:41.211
Guy's like Jerry are monitor
ed their whole lives.

32:41.253 --> 32:44.173
Constant supervision
24 hours a day.

32:44.214 --> 32:47.718
You remember the scar tissue
we found on his wrist?

32:54.224 --> 32:55.976
I think it's possible
that our vic

32:56.018 --> 32:57.728
spent most of his life
in restraints.

32:58.228 --> 33:00.731
So either he escaped or...

33:00.772 --> 33:03.192
someone set him free.

33:03.233 --> 33:05.736
In which case, they'd be
responsible for his death.

33:06.236 --> 33:08.238
I heard your case
has gone to the dogs.

33:08.280 --> 33:10.199
Oh, Hodges, heel.

33:10.240 --> 33:11.700
No, better yet,
play dead, man

33:11.742 --> 33:13.744
Play nice,
I'm throwing you a bone.

33:14.244 --> 33:16.246
The fingernail scrapings
from your female vic

33:16.288 --> 33:18.207
was baking grease.

33:18.248 --> 33:19.750
How does that fit
in the puzzle?

33:25.756 --> 33:27.216
Hey.

33:27.257 --> 33:28.717
According to
the court records,

33:28.759 --> 33:31.011
the Tinsleys weren't just
fighting over property,

33:31.053 --> 33:33.263
they were also engaged in
an expensive custody battle.

33:33.305 --> 33:34.223
Custody over what?

33:34.264 --> 33:35.766
They didn't have any kids.

33:36.266 --> 33:37.267
They had Kahlua.

33:39.269 --> 33:42.272
And evidentally,
yesterday both parties agreed

33:42.314 --> 33:44.775
to let the dog decide
for herself.

33:45.275 --> 33:46.276
According to
Michael's girlfriend,

33:46.777 --> 33:49.279
the dog was his,
but Kahlua chose Lori.

33:49.321 --> 33:50.739
Kahlua, come.

33:50.781 --> 33:52.241
Kahlua, co
Come here.

33:52.282 --> 33:53.784
Come.
Come here.

33:54.284 --> 33:55.285
Kahlua, come. Come.

33:55.327 --> 33:56.286
Come to mama,
sweetie.

34:00.791 --> 34:01.792
I think I know why.

34:03.293 --> 34:06.296
Lori greased up
before the big face-off.

34:07.798 --> 34:09.299
Kahlua, come.

34:09.800 --> 34:11.260
Come, Kahlua.

34:11.301 --> 34:12.302
Kahlua, Kahlua, come.

34:12.344 --> 34:13.554
Come, come here.

34:13.594 --> 34:14.804
Kahlua, come here.

34:14.847 --> 34:16.306
Come.

34:19.309 --> 34:20.268
A dog's sense of smell

34:20.310 --> 34:22.771
is 25 times more sensitive than humans.

34:22.813 --> 34:25.815
Bacon grease would've
been pretty irresistible.

34:25.858 --> 34:27.775
Question is...

34:27.818 --> 34:30.320
did Michael know that
Lori was playing dirty?

34:32.322 --> 34:33.824
Stokes.

34:35.324 --> 34:36.326
Yeah, all right, cool.

34:38.328 --> 34:41.331
Our suspect is in custody.

34:42.833 --> 34:44.293
Animal control

34:44.333 --> 34:45.793
picked her up
near Centennial Park,

34:45.835 --> 34:48.338
called the number on the tag,
left a voice mail.

34:48.380 --> 34:49.840
Dead people don't return calls.

34:49.882 --> 34:52.092
New collar, new tags.

34:52.134 --> 34:54.303
Kahlua.
Same name.

34:54.344 --> 34:55.804
Spoke to Animal Control.

34:55.846 --> 34:59.099
Kahlua number two was adopted
the same day as the murder.

34:59.141 --> 35:02.352
You want to guess the
adopter's name? Michael Tinsley.

35:02.394 --> 35:03.812
You bet.

35:03.854 --> 35:06.607
He adopted Kahlua's
doppelganger.

35:06.648 --> 35:09.359
Left tooth is chipped.
Confirm's ID.

35:09.860 --> 35:11.361
She doesn't seem very ferocious.

35:11.403 --> 35:12.362
You want to see ferocious?

35:12.404 --> 35:13.864
Yeah.

35:29.379 --> 35:30.839
How did you know?

35:30.881 --> 35:33.383
When the guys loaded her up
into the Animal Control van,

35:33.425 --> 35:34.885
they slammed the door
and she went off.

35:35.385 --> 35:36.386
So the gun acted as a trigger.

35:36.887 --> 35:38.347
She heard it and attacked Lori.

35:38.388 --> 35:40.349
Probably abused
in the past.

35:40.390 --> 35:41.391
If they'd known,
they never would've

35:41.892 --> 35:42.851
put her up for adoption.

35:42.893 --> 35:45.646
Michael broke into the house
intending to swap dogs,

35:45.687 --> 35:48.398
hoping that Lori wouldn't even
notice the difference.

35:59.910 --> 36:01.411
You don't give
a damn about Kahlua!

36:01.912 --> 36:03.163
You just don't want me
to have her!

36:03.205 --> 36:04.414
You care more
about that stupid dog

36:04.456 --> 36:05.374
than you did me!

36:05.415 --> 36:06.416
For once
you got it right!

36:20.931 --> 36:22.891
When Kahlua number two took off,

36:22.933 --> 36:25.435
Kahlua number one
came out of hiding.

36:38.448 --> 36:39.950
The police showed up,
she got scared,

36:39.992 --> 36:41.410
went back to her closet.

36:41.451 --> 36:42.953
Their marriage ended
in a dog fight,

36:43.453 --> 36:45.455
and only the dog survived.

36:45.956 --> 36:47.916
So I called about
a dozen Jerry Gables.

36:47.958 --> 36:51.461
One had an answering machine
for Jerry and Suzie Gable.

36:51.503 --> 36:54.965
This apartment is listed
to Jerry and Suzie Gable.

36:55.007 --> 36:56.967
Here's Suzie.

36:57.467 --> 36:58.969
Las Vegas Police.

37:02.973 --> 37:04.975
Please tell me you found Jerry.

37:20.491 --> 37:22.951
Okay, so who are you?

37:22.993 --> 37:25.454
I'm Susie's boyfriend.

37:25.496 --> 37:27.998
All right, Susie's boyfriend,
what's your name?

37:28.040 --> 37:30.000
Look, I don't have
anything else to say.

37:30.042 --> 37:32.461
Hey, that's
my easiest question.

37:32.503 --> 37:35.464
Hey, you don't want
to give us your name, fine,

37:35.506 --> 37:38.509
but you better explain
why Jerry's not in this chair.

37:40.511 --> 37:44.515
All right, look, I'm going
to print this restraint.

37:44.556 --> 37:46.517
And when I find your
fingerprints all over it,

37:47.017 --> 37:49.019
I won't need to ask you again.

37:49.061 --> 37:51.021
Okay, okay, all right.

37:52.523 --> 37:54.024
He escaped.

37:54.525 --> 37:56.026
All right? I was supposed
to be watching him,

37:56.527 --> 37:59.029
and I conked out for a second,
and by the time I got up,

37:59.071 --> 38:00.030
he was gone from his chair.

38:00.072 --> 38:00.989
He escaped?

38:01.031 --> 38:03.033
So, what, the guy's Houdini?

38:03.075 --> 38:04.535
Trust me.

38:05.035 --> 38:07.037
He may have been slow,
but he was manipulative.

38:07.079 --> 38:08.497
Yeah.

38:08.539 --> 38:14.044
Look, how do you deny
a 30-year-old man food?

38:15.546 --> 38:16.505
I mean, I felt like

38:16.547 --> 38:18.507
I was torturing the poor guy.

38:18.549 --> 38:21.510
Yeah, I told you
them Vikings suck.

38:21.552 --> 38:25.556
All right, I'll meet you
at the Circus Town book.

38:25.597 --> 38:28.559
Can I go
to Circus Town with you?

38:29.059 --> 38:31.061
I heard the buffet there
is yummy.

38:31.103 --> 38:32.563
No.

38:42.072 --> 38:44.074
My plan was just
to drop him off at the buffet

38:44.575 --> 38:48.078
while I went back
to the sports book.

38:48.120 --> 38:51.582
By the time I got back...
oh, man...

39:09.099 --> 39:10.851
I couldn't help myself.

39:10.893 --> 39:12.603
I had to sign him up.

39:14.605 --> 39:15.564
So let me guess-

39:15.606 --> 39:17.107
you blew his winnings
at the sports book?

39:17.608 --> 39:19.568
Well, what was he
gonna do with them

39:19.610 --> 39:22.613
He's been strapped to a damn
chair his whole life.

39:22.654 --> 39:24.364
You know, you managed
to supersize a combo

39:24.406 --> 39:26.116
of two deadly sins-
greed and gluttony.

39:26.617 --> 39:29.077
Shame on you.

39:29.119 --> 39:31.079
So what's he doing
in a dumpster?

39:31.121 --> 39:34.124
I don't know, was there
food in the dumpster?

39:34.625 --> 39:35.626
'Cause when we were

39:36.126 --> 39:37.628
on our way home,
Jerry was still hungry.

39:37.669 --> 39:39.087
Wanted to hit up Krispy Kreme.

39:39.129 --> 39:41.131
And by the time
I could tell him no,

39:41.632 --> 39:43.634
he was running off
down the street.

39:43.675 --> 39:46.136
I looked for him all night.

39:46.637 --> 39:49.640
Yeah? Where's Susie?

39:52.643 --> 39:56.146
I knew I shouldn't have left
Jerry with my boyfriend.

39:56.188 --> 39:58.148
I'd been calling to check in

39:58.190 --> 39:59.107
He wasn't answering.

39:59.149 --> 40:01.151
I could tell something was up.

40:01.193 --> 40:02.903
Why did you le
ave your brother

40:02.945 --> 40:04.655
with somebody you didn't trust?

40:04.696 --> 40:07.115
There was no one else.

40:07.157 --> 40:09.117
I had to get
this surgery today

40:09.159 --> 40:12.621
or my insurance wasn't
going to cover it.

40:12.663 --> 40:14.665
Couldn't you have left h
im with a family member?

40:15.165 --> 40:16.667
We have no family.

40:17.167 --> 40:21.421
Our parents died
in a car crash years ago.

40:21.463 --> 40:25.676
What about some kind
of professional help?

40:26.176 --> 40:29.429
I'm a waitress, Miss.

40:29.471 --> 40:32.641
I... I don't make much.

40:32.683 --> 40:35.686
There's a really nice
institution in Summerlin,

40:35.727 --> 40:38.939
but it costs a $100,000 a year.

40:38.981 --> 40:42.192
And the last babysitter I hired,

40:42.693 --> 40:45.696
Jerry beat up
trying to get to the fridge.

40:48.198 --> 40:49.158
Iswear to you,

40:49.199 --> 40:51.201
I really tried to take
care of my brother.

40:51.243 --> 40:54.705
I really...
did the best I could.

41:25.235 --> 41:27.738
Jerry took third place?

41:27.779 --> 41:30.240
Yeah.

41:32.242 --> 41:34.745
I bet he had
the time of his life.
