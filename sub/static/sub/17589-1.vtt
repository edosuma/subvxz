01:10.837 --> 01:12.202
Hey, sleepy head!

01:13.440 --> 01:15.601
- You up?
- What time is it?

01:17.744 --> 01:18.904
Almost noon.

01:19.546 --> 01:21.411
I'm afraid you've got to go.

01:22.148 --> 01:24.275
- Excuse me?
- You've got to go.

01:24.417 --> 01:27.386
I have friends coming over
for brunch.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.480
What? In My apartment?

01:39.632 --> 01:40.690
Sorry.

01:42.235 --> 01:45.204
3 years and you still treat me
like a one-night stand!

02:01.121 --> 02:04.784
Babies! Sorry, I'm late.
I had to deal with James.

02:04.924 --> 02:06.585
James? I thought you
broke up with James.

02:06.726 --> 02:09.388
I did. He's just not
taking it very well.

02:09.529 --> 02:11.997
What? All alone in his big,
empty castle?

02:12.132 --> 02:13.292
Be nice.

02:13.433 --> 02:15.697
Anyway, I had to give
his ego CPR.

02:16.236 --> 02:17.703
How tiresome.
What did you say?

02:17.837 --> 02:19.202
Oh you know, how great he is,
how he's going to make

02:19.339 --> 02:21.102
the right girl so happy,
how it's really not him,

02:21.241 --> 02:23.106
- it's blah blah blah...
- And he believed you?

02:23.243 --> 02:26.007
Of course not!
So then I had to fuck him.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.204
Right.

02:28.047 --> 02:29.105
Where's Peter?

02:43.530 --> 02:45.191
Babies, we missed you
at brunch!

02:45.331 --> 02:47.595
Sorry, I had to finish
1500 words for Empire.

02:47.734 --> 02:49.395
- Talullah sends her love.
- How is she?

02:49.536 --> 02:52.004
In love! With this Jamaican model
I set her up with.

02:52.138 --> 02:54.402
Apparently, he shags her
4 times a day

02:54.541 --> 02:56.509
and inspires her to write
volumes of new poetry!

02:56.643 --> 02:59.111
- Isn't that great?
- No, I hate Talullah's poetry.

02:59.245 --> 03:01.611
Speaking of shags,
how was your date with Doug?

03:02.048 --> 03:03.982
- Fine.
- Fine? Just fine?

03:04.117 --> 03:05.084
Look, Jacks!

03:05.218 --> 03:07.482
I really appreciate you
trying to set me up with Doug

03:07.620 --> 03:08.985
And Phil and John.

03:09.122 --> 03:11.181
- What's wrong with Doug?
- Nothing, I just...

03:11.324 --> 03:12.586
I just don't see much of
a future together.

03:12.725 --> 03:14.488
How do you know that
after one dinner?

03:14.627 --> 03:16.288
Maybe because we have
nothing in common?

03:16.429 --> 03:18.294
That's not true.
You're an artist, Doug's an artist.

03:18.431 --> 03:19.398
Doug's a florist!

03:19.532 --> 03:20.999
He's a horticultural designer.

03:21.134 --> 03:23.295
Yeah, whose 'life goal' is
to create a sculpture of

03:23.436 --> 03:25.996
Princess Diana entirely of
bougainvillea.

03:26.139 --> 03:27.197
You are such a snob!

03:27.340 --> 03:29.205
I am not a snob!
I have hay fever.

03:29.342 --> 03:30.400
I'd be allergic to Doug's work.

03:30.543 --> 03:32.306
Look, Doug deserves better
than me.

03:32.445 --> 03:34.606
You're never going to find
anyone with that attitude.

03:34.747 --> 03:36.612
What attitude?
I'm just being realistic.

03:36.716 --> 03:39.082
If you're realistic,
then I'm the Queen of England.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.779
Hey! I'm the Queen of England!

03:41.921 --> 03:44.287
Hello, your Majesty!

04:18.224 --> 04:20.283
Oh Daphne, you poor thing!

04:20.426 --> 04:22.189
Of course, I'll deal
with the shoot.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.396
I can handle Sasha.

04:25.131 --> 04:28.794
OK. Lots of love, big kiss.
Bye bye.

04:30.136 --> 04:33.196
Since when do you say 'lots of
love, big kiss' to your boss?

04:33.339 --> 04:35.603
Since Daphne's going through
a nasty divorce.

04:35.742 --> 04:37.607
She needs positive affirmation.

04:38.745 --> 04:39.803
Babies, what's wrong?

04:39.946 --> 04:41.413
Nothing.
I'm just a little nervous.

04:41.547 --> 04:43.014
He's meant to have
a ferocious temper.

04:43.149 --> 04:44.081
Who?

04:44.217 --> 04:46.981
Marvin Bernstein.
The man I'm interviewing today.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.384
Since when do you get nervous
about celebrity profiles?

04:49.522 --> 04:52.491
Since we're not talking about
some two-bit British TV presenter.

04:52.625 --> 04:55.185
Marvin Bernstein is
a living legend!

04:55.328 --> 04:56.989
The man's produced some of
the best films

04:57.130 --> 04:58.188
in the last 20 years!

04:58.331 --> 05:00.299
He's a giant among
the film industry!

05:00.433 --> 05:02.799
- A giant?
- Maybe I should call in sick.

05:02.935 --> 05:04.402
Maybe that's what's
bothering you.

05:04.537 --> 05:05.504
That I'm not feeling well?

05:05.638 --> 05:07.503
No, that Marvin Bernstein
reminds you

05:07.640 --> 05:10.200
that these celebrity profiles
are meant to pay the rent.

05:10.343 --> 05:12.311
While you're focusing on
your screenplays.

05:12.445 --> 05:14.913
Can we not talk about my
nonexistent film career right now?

05:15.048 --> 05:16.777
I'm feeling small enough
as it is.

05:23.222 --> 05:24.780
Babies? Just remember.

05:24.924 --> 05:29.691
Marvin Bernstein may be a giant.
But You are a giant in waiting.

05:29.829 --> 05:31.694
Yes, yes I am.

05:31.831 --> 05:33.890
- I have no idea what that means.
- Neither do I.

05:45.845 --> 05:47.608
I'm here to see
Mr. Marvin Bernstein.

05:47.747 --> 05:49.214
- Your name?
- Peter Simon.

05:51.117 --> 05:53.881
Peter Simon.
Any relation to Neil?

05:54.020 --> 05:54.577
Excuse me?

05:54.721 --> 05:58.088
Neil Simon! Great writer.
You a great writer?

05:58.224 --> 05:59.486
Oh, I don't know.

05:59.625 --> 06:00.990
You'd know if you were great.

06:01.828 --> 06:04.388
Mr Bernstein?
Kenneth Branagh on line 2.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.293
Kenneth Branagh!
Another great writer!

06:06.432 --> 06:07.490
Kenny B!

06:09.035 --> 06:11.003
I loved the script!
I loved it!

06:11.137 --> 06:12.195
Fuckin' brilliant dialogue!

06:15.742 --> 06:17.607
Well, hat's off to
Shakespeare then!

06:17.744 --> 06:19.507
- No answer.
- What?

06:19.645 --> 06:24.378
I said no answer in
Mr. Bernstein's room.

06:26.018 --> 06:27.178
Oh, right.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.979
Fine. I'll just wait.

06:30.123 --> 06:31.181
Please.

06:42.735 --> 06:45.101
OK, ladies, arms around
each other.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.604
OK, now, Jade look into
BenG's eyes, please.

06:47.740 --> 06:50.004
Thank you very much, OK.
No! With love.

06:50.143 --> 06:51.508
Pandora. How's it going?

06:51.644 --> 06:54.704
Oh, you know, BenG hates Jade.
Jade hates BenG.

06:54.847 --> 06:56.405
And Sasha hates everyone.

06:56.549 --> 06:57.880
Nothing like a happy set.

07:01.020 --> 07:02.282
Hello? I'm waiting!

07:03.222 --> 07:05.690
Paolo, when I have to ask for it,
it's too late!

07:07.326 --> 07:09.089
Who's the cutie?

07:09.529 --> 07:12.794
Sasha's latest squeeze.
Argentinean.

07:12.932 --> 07:16.390
Apparently, Sasha picked him up
at lpanema Beach.

07:16.536 --> 07:19.699
Amazing how Sasha always finds
his 'assistants' at the beach.

07:19.839 --> 07:20.806
Isn't it?

07:20.940 --> 07:24.000
I suppose it allows him to
examine their 'qualifications'.

07:35.621 --> 07:36.485
Talullah? What's wrong?

07:36.622 --> 07:38.681
Oh God! I just had
a huge row with Freedom

07:38.825 --> 07:39.689
and I think it's over.

07:39.826 --> 07:41.589
OK, I'm in the middle of
a shoot...

07:41.727 --> 07:43.695
Oh God! I feel like dying!

07:43.830 --> 07:46.196
OK. Tell me exactly
what happened.

07:46.332 --> 07:48.391
Well, he came over
and we shagged.

07:48.534 --> 07:50.593
And then I asked him
what he thought about monogamy.

07:50.736 --> 07:52.897
You don't talk about monogamy
After you shag a guy...

07:53.039 --> 07:55.303
- No, no but he said he liked monogamy.
- He did?

07:55.441 --> 07:59.707
Then he said he also likes
oak and pine and maple...

07:59.846 --> 08:01.211
So he's got a sense of humour.

08:01.347 --> 08:02.609
Monogamy is not a laughing matter.

08:02.748 --> 08:05.273
If Freedom ever cheated on me,
I don't think I could go on!

08:05.418 --> 08:07.079
Talullah! You've known
the guy for a week.

08:07.220 --> 08:09.381
Stop talking like you're
in some kind of a movie.

08:09.522 --> 08:11.183
I can't help it.
I'm naturally dramatic.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.985
Excuse me.
Sasha needs you.

08:13.125 --> 08:15.389
Oh, right.
I'll be right there.

08:17.230 --> 08:20.597
- Who is that?
- Sasha's assistant. He's gay.

08:20.733 --> 08:21.597
- What?
- Gay!

08:21.734 --> 08:23.395
- How can you tell?
- Trust me.

08:23.536 --> 08:24.798
I have the best gaydar
in London.

08:24.937 --> 08:26.598
That boy gay as a goose.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.002
Lucky fucking geese.

08:33.246 --> 08:34.304
Excuse me, sir.

08:34.447 --> 08:37.883
We've just got word Mr. Bernstein
had to fly back to New York.

08:39.018 --> 08:41.384
Oh, right. Thank you.

08:54.634 --> 08:56.397
I'm so sorry!

08:56.536 --> 08:57.798
I'm so sorry.

09:03.743 --> 09:05.404
Now you love her!
Feed a grape.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.604
With love! Real love!
Excellent!

09:07.747 --> 09:09.214
And crush a grape on her mouth.

09:10.116 --> 09:12.482
Excellent!
Make it sexy! More sexy!

09:12.618 --> 09:13.778
Make the grape sexy!

09:13.920 --> 09:17.083
Yes! Yes! And kiss her.
On the mouth.

09:17.223 --> 09:20.681
Excellent! Sexy love!
Yeah, I think we have it!

09:27.333 --> 09:31.099
Jacks, would it be all right
if I borrowed an outfitjust for tonight?

09:31.237 --> 09:32.397
I kind of have a date.

09:32.538 --> 09:34.802
- A date? With who?
- Oh, just this guy.

09:34.941 --> 09:36.499
I mean, I'm not sure
it's even technically a date.

09:36.642 --> 09:37.506
It's just dinner.

09:37.643 --> 09:40.908
Pandora. Pick out the sexiest
outfit and go home immediately!

09:41.047 --> 09:43.311
- But what about the wrap?
- I'll cover for you!

09:43.416 --> 09:44.781
What's more important?
True love or fashion?

09:44.917 --> 09:45.884
It's just a dinner...

09:46.018 --> 09:46.882
OK. Let me rephrase that.

09:47.019 --> 09:49.180
What's more important,
anything or fashion?

09:49.322 --> 09:50.289
Thanks, Jacks.

09:50.923 --> 09:52.481
Paolo, querido.

09:52.625 --> 09:54.593
Dinner, 9 o'clock, Nobu.
Don't be late.

09:54.727 --> 09:55.989
I can't face them on my own.

09:56.128 --> 09:58.096
- No problem.
- Gracias, carino!

10:03.035 --> 10:05.094
Katie from Purple will be
picking these up in the morning.

10:05.237 --> 10:06.295
Alright.

10:09.041 --> 10:10.099
James!

10:13.245 --> 10:14.303
How was your day?

10:24.824 --> 10:26.883
- Anybody home?
- In here!

10:27.026 --> 10:29.392
So how'd it go with
the legendary giant?

10:29.829 --> 10:32.195
- It didn't. He stood me up.
- I'm sorry, Babies.

10:32.331 --> 10:33.696
Why are you reading
a cookbook in the nude?

10:33.833 --> 10:34.891
It's 'The Naked Chef.'

10:35.034 --> 10:37.400
- What? You're keeping him company?
- I'm waiting for the shower.

10:37.536 --> 10:39.800
You're almost out of shampoo
so I had to use soap.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.704
- Oh hi, Peter.
- Hello, James. How are you?

10:43.843 --> 10:47.210
- Good, yes. You?
- Yes, good. Thanks.

10:49.048 --> 10:50.276
Well, I better be off.

10:51.017 --> 10:53.076
My flight's at 9
and I've still got to pack.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.178
Right.

10:55.921 --> 10:57.684
- I'll call you when I land.
- Have fun in New York!

10:57.823 --> 10:58.790
Thank you.

10:58.924 --> 11:00.585
- Bye, Peter.
- Bye, James.

11:08.734 --> 11:09.792
Jacks?

11:11.737 --> 11:12.897
What are you doing?

11:13.039 --> 11:15.507
Reading this delicious recipe
for Beetroot Salad

11:15.641 --> 11:17.506
with marjoram
and balsamic vinegar dressing!

11:17.643 --> 11:20.009
- What are you doing with James?
- Nothing.

11:20.146 --> 11:22.011
You broke up with him
a month ago!

11:22.148 --> 11:24.480
I know, it's just sex.
He fills a void.

11:24.617 --> 11:25.379
Literally.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.985
I don't see how you expect
to meet someone new

11:27.119 --> 11:28.984
if you spend all your time
with your ex.

11:29.121 --> 11:30.179
Good point!

11:30.322 --> 11:31.687
Maybe I should get back
together with James

11:31.824 --> 11:33.485
so I spend less time with him.

11:34.226 --> 11:35.693
I don't think it's funny.

11:35.828 --> 11:36.988
Neither do I.

11:37.129 --> 11:39.393
What's the point of shagging
someone ad nauseam

11:39.532 --> 11:40.794
if you know you're never
going to love them?

11:40.933 --> 11:42.093
It's not so simple.

11:42.234 --> 11:44.600
He's in love with you, Jacks.
You're not in love with him.

11:44.737 --> 11:45.795
It doesn't get more simple than that.

11:45.938 --> 11:49.101
That's not fair! I happen to
care about James. A lot.

11:49.241 --> 11:51.209
And I hate the fact
that he feels more than me.

11:51.343 --> 11:53.208
And I hate the fact
that I'm not in love with him.

11:53.345 --> 11:54.607
Because I know I should be.

11:54.747 --> 11:57.375
Because he's smart and sweet
and decent

11:57.516 --> 11:59.074
and I don't want to hurt him.

11:59.218 --> 12:01.277
So I keep hoping that
I'll grow into it.

12:01.420 --> 12:04.184
That maybe one day
I'll wake up and I'll feel...

12:04.323 --> 12:06.291
- What?
- In love!

12:06.425 --> 12:08.791
You know, dizzy and
feverish and nauseous...

12:08.928 --> 12:10.486
That's not love, Jacks.
That's the flu.

12:10.629 --> 12:12.494
Well, at least I'm trying!
You big cynic.

12:12.631 --> 12:13.791
I'm not a cynic!

12:13.933 --> 12:15.696
When's the last time you even
considered falling in love?

12:15.835 --> 12:16.995
Today!

12:17.136 --> 12:20.003
I'm not talking about some
character in a novel or a movie.

12:20.139 --> 12:21.197
Neither am I.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.006
- What?
- What?

12:25.144 --> 12:27.203
What? Peter!

12:27.947 --> 12:29.812
So, tell me everything!
What's his name?

12:30.516 --> 12:31.881
David Williams.

12:32.017 --> 12:35.475
- David Williams, and?
- And what?

12:35.621 --> 12:39.079
And, who is he?
Where'd you meet him?

12:39.225 --> 12:40.886
How'd you meet?
Tell me everything!

12:42.328 --> 12:43.386
Well...

12:43.529 --> 12:46.191
I was on my way out of the hotel.
And he was walking in.

12:47.733 --> 12:50.395
He had these two paintings under his arm
and a Sotheby's catalogue

12:50.536 --> 12:53.505
and we just sort of bumped
into each other.

12:53.639 --> 12:55.402
I can't explain it, but...

12:56.842 --> 12:58.002
It was amazing.

12:58.144 --> 13:01.511
Because it was like I was
finally seeing the person.

13:01.647 --> 13:03.979
I'd been waiting for
my entire life.

13:05.518 --> 13:08.078
Oh my God!
That's so romantic!

13:09.622 --> 13:11.590
So when do I get to meet him?

13:13.526 --> 13:14.788
Right after I do?

13:15.728 --> 13:17.286
- What?
- Well... We didn't actually meet.

13:17.429 --> 13:19.090
Per se. As it were...

13:19.532 --> 13:21.397
But you know his name.

13:21.534 --> 13:23.798
Yes, it was on
the Sotheby's catalogue.

13:24.937 --> 13:26.802
He dropped it
and I picked it up.

13:28.340 --> 13:30.103
And you didn't say anything?

13:31.043 --> 13:32.203
You didn't speak?

13:40.519 --> 13:43.181
And this is the person you
think you could be in love with?

13:43.322 --> 13:46.189
Someone that you've never
even spoken to?

13:46.325 --> 13:47.383
Someone that you've
never even met?

13:47.526 --> 13:49.391
Look, Jacks, I know
it sounds crazy.

13:49.528 --> 13:50.995
I just...

13:51.931 --> 13:53.990
I really think he's the one.

13:56.135 --> 13:57.500
Of course he is...

14:08.547 --> 14:09.707
I don't think I can face this.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.374
Of course you can!
We're here to support Finlay!

14:12.518 --> 14:14.076
Besides, you can't stay
at home every night,

14:14.220 --> 14:16.279
pining for someone
you've never even met!

14:16.422 --> 14:17.480
Thank you.

14:28.334 --> 14:30.996
I thought this whole dead
animal thing was 10 years ago.

14:31.136 --> 14:32.899
In formaldehyde, yes.

14:33.038 --> 14:35.199
But Finlay says this stuff
isn't preserved.

14:35.341 --> 14:38.105
- It rots right in front of your eyes!
- Nice!

14:38.844 --> 14:42.007
Where is Fin anyway?
Say our hellos before I turn vegan.

14:43.249 --> 14:44.375
Hello? Hello.

14:44.516 --> 14:47.178
I'm Finlay McMillan
and I would like to

14:47.319 --> 14:49.879
welcome all of you
to Unicorn & Gallagher's

14:50.022 --> 14:51.080
LIFE IS DEATH exhibit.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.885
Freedom, get me a glass of champagne.
My throat's parched.

14:54.827 --> 14:55.794
Do I look like a slave?

14:55.928 --> 14:57.691
Before I introduce
the artist himself,

14:57.830 --> 15:02.494
Talullah Wentworth has very kindly
agreed to read one of her poems.

15:02.635 --> 15:04.000
Talullah Wentworth!

15:06.739 --> 15:08.104
God help us!

15:08.240 --> 15:11.107
I think it's sweet.
Talullah wanting to be Sylvia Plath.

15:11.243 --> 15:13.302
Well, she should fast forward
and find an oven.

15:14.747 --> 15:15.714
Thank you, Finlay.

15:15.848 --> 15:21.582
And thank you Unicorn for
this truly moving exhibit!

15:22.421 --> 15:26.687
I'd like to dedicate this poem
to Finlay's lover

15:26.825 --> 15:29.487
and my best friend,
Troy Johnson,

15:29.628 --> 15:31.687
who's birthday it is today!

15:32.831 --> 15:35.095
Troy would have loved
to come tonight,

15:35.234 --> 15:38.499
but thanks to the conspiracy
of silence

15:38.637 --> 15:41.003
between the Catholic Church
and the Tories

15:41.140 --> 15:43.506
in the face of Aids, he can't.

15:43.642 --> 15:45.610
Because he's dead.

15:45.744 --> 15:48.611
- I'm not drunk enough for this.
- Neither is Finlay.

15:51.517 --> 15:52.575
MEAT.

15:53.919 --> 15:58.583
Big black dick
in nice soft chick.

15:58.724 --> 16:01.386
I never knew
the thrill I'd feel,

16:01.527 --> 16:04.189
knowing how you had to steal.

16:04.330 --> 16:07.493
You dangled your worm,
I took the bait.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.693
This fish is caught.
It's only fate.

16:11.437 --> 16:16.602
DIE DIE DIE
White lmperialist Pigs.

16:16.742 --> 16:20.405
Aristocracy is pale and weak.

16:20.546 --> 16:23.208
You can't kill my love.

16:23.349 --> 16:27.183
He's black.
He's MEAT.

16:40.733 --> 16:42.496
Jacks! What are you doing here?

16:42.634 --> 16:45.603
I just came back to
make sure you're OK.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.899
- I'm fine. Sure.
- Yeah?

16:48.741 --> 16:50.208
Yeah! Absolutely.

16:52.344 --> 16:54.608
I just hate this day,
you know?

16:54.747 --> 16:56.009
10 years.

16:56.915 --> 16:58.576
How come I still miss
him so much?

16:58.717 --> 17:01.379
Because you are an amazing
human being.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.988
And because he was
an amazing human being.

17:04.123 --> 17:06.489
And because I'm a silly
old queen.

17:06.625 --> 17:07.683
That too.

17:09.428 --> 17:11.692
- Thanks, Jacks.
- For what?

17:11.829 --> 17:13.297
For always remembering.

17:13.432 --> 17:15.593
And for being there for me.
For all of us.

17:15.733 --> 17:18.294
I'm a superficial assistant
at a major fashion magazine.

17:18.436 --> 17:20.200
You'll ruin my reputation.

17:20.339 --> 17:21.896
Come on.
I'll give you a ride home.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.098
Besides, I need your help
with Peter.

17:23.242 --> 17:24.709
He's fallen madly in love.

17:24.843 --> 17:27.209
- Yeah? With who?
- I don't know. Neither does he.

17:27.346 --> 17:28.404
Right!

17:30.015 --> 17:32.483
Speaking of boyfriends,
how's what's his name?

17:32.618 --> 17:34.176
- You mean Freedom?
- Freedom.

17:34.319 --> 17:36.583
- What kind of name is Freedom?
- Jamaican, darling.

17:36.722 --> 17:39.589
- Why didn't he come to brunch?
- We had a row about his car.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.488
I told him I don't generally
get into vehicles

17:41.627 --> 17:43.094
that cost less than my handbag.

17:43.228 --> 17:44.991
And he accused me of
being a spoiled bitch

17:45.130 --> 17:46.995
who's only in love
with his skin color.

17:47.132 --> 17:48.599
Which is surprisingly
insightful for someone

17:48.734 --> 17:50.599
who's stoned 24 hours a day.

17:50.736 --> 17:53.899
- Oh, and the creep keeps calling.
- What creep?

17:54.039 --> 17:56.405
From the phone company.
His name's Tony.

17:56.542 --> 17:59.306
He calls me 5 times a day
begging me to go out with him.

17:59.445 --> 18:01.413
Apparently my voice haunts him.

18:01.547 --> 18:03.981
You have an obscene caller
from British Telecom?

18:04.116 --> 18:06.277
I told her she should
report him to the police.

18:06.418 --> 18:10.184
I would, but he promised me
free broadband.

18:10.322 --> 18:11.880
- What is broadband?
- Hi, guys, sorry I'm late.

18:12.024 --> 18:13.491
- Hi, Fin. How are you?
- Hello, darling!

18:13.625 --> 18:15.183
Hi, just a cappuccino please.

18:15.327 --> 18:17.295
So, I made a few calls
and I'm pretty certain

18:17.429 --> 18:18.191
it's who I thought.

18:18.330 --> 18:19.092
Are you serious?

18:19.231 --> 18:21.995
Well, he was definitely at
the Chancery Hotel last Monday.

18:22.134 --> 18:23.795
- Oh, my God!
- What are we talking about?

18:23.936 --> 18:25.301
Finlay's figured out
who Peter fell in love

18:25.437 --> 18:26.096
with last week.

18:26.238 --> 18:28.900
He was at the Chancery Hotel,
monday morning, seeing a client!

18:29.041 --> 18:30.508
- Who was?
- David Williams!

18:30.642 --> 18:33.008
- You know the guy I bumped into?
- I know David!

18:33.145 --> 18:34.510
I love biblical names.

18:34.646 --> 18:36.978
I used to have a cat
named David. King David!

18:37.116 --> 18:39.380
- What's he like?
- He's dead, fell out of a tree.

18:39.518 --> 18:41.486
He's head of Sotheby's
Contemporary Art Department.

18:41.620 --> 18:44.987
He's smart, charming, kind.
Attractive, as you know.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.887
All the rich ladies
have crushes on him!

18:47.025 --> 18:48.492
During his auctions,
they all try and outbid

18:48.627 --> 18:49.594
each otherjust to impress him!

18:49.728 --> 18:51.389
I bet my Mother's one of
those rich old women.

18:51.530 --> 18:52.792
- Is he gay?
- He's gay!

18:52.931 --> 18:53.795
So was my cat.

18:53.932 --> 18:56.492
Actually, I can't believe
I haven't tried to fix you up ages ago.

18:56.635 --> 18:57.602
He's perfect for you!

18:57.736 --> 19:00.204
And he was very intrigued by
what I told him.

19:00.339 --> 19:02.398
What you told him?
What did you tell him?

19:02.541 --> 19:03.599
Nothing.

19:05.744 --> 19:06.608
OK, everything.

19:06.745 --> 19:08.007
- But he was really flattered.
- Oh God!

19:08.147 --> 19:10.081
- There's no way I can meet him now.
- What? Why not?

19:10.215 --> 19:11.273
Because it's too set up!

19:11.416 --> 19:13.577
There's no way he'll be
into me knowing I'm so into him.

19:13.719 --> 19:15.482
David's not like that!
Trust me!

19:15.621 --> 19:17.179
I have to agree with Peter.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.187
I think accidental meets
are much better.

19:19.324 --> 19:22.088
Take me and Freedom.
We met in a launderette.

19:22.227 --> 19:24.695
After I told you
he was going to be there!

19:25.731 --> 19:28.097
Which isn't to say
accidents can't be planned.

19:43.815 --> 19:44.975
Are you OK?

19:45.817 --> 19:46.875
I'm fine.

19:47.219 --> 19:49.278
I'm always like this
when I have to see my mother.

19:49.421 --> 19:50.786
Would you rather not go?

19:51.723 --> 19:53.190
No, don't be silly!

19:53.325 --> 19:54.986
This is your big night!

19:55.127 --> 19:57.994
Besides Mother loves you.
She loves this David.

19:58.130 --> 20:01.293
Her theme song is
'Matchmaker, Matchmaker.'

20:03.435 --> 20:06.700
Do you want a brownie?
I made them myself.

20:07.940 --> 20:08.998
Thank you.

20:11.243 --> 20:12.608
These are very good.

20:12.744 --> 20:15.008
Yes, they've got quite
a lot of hash in them.

20:19.918 --> 20:21.283
Talullah! What's wrong?

20:23.222 --> 20:25.190
Freedom's having an affair.

20:25.324 --> 20:27.690
An affair?
You've only been going out for 2 weeks!

20:27.826 --> 20:29.384
Who's he having an affair with?

20:30.229 --> 20:33.289
Me, I just found out
he's married.

20:48.747 --> 20:51.477
- Are you OK?
- Oh! Yes, fine.

20:51.617 --> 20:55.178
I just lost my keys
and they're playing hard to get.

20:56.221 --> 20:57.279
Tada!

20:57.422 --> 21:00.289
We haven't met properly.
I'm Paolo Sarmiento by the way.

21:00.425 --> 21:01.483
Emily Jackson.

21:01.627 --> 21:03.595
But all my friends
just call me 'Jacks.'

21:03.729 --> 21:06.892
OK. All my friends
just call me Paolo.

21:08.033 --> 21:09.091
OK.

21:09.234 --> 21:11.293
You look very beautiful.

21:12.838 --> 21:15.898
Oh! Well, I'm going to this
black tie thing for my roommate.

21:16.041 --> 21:18.009
Well, it's not exactly
for my roommate.

21:18.143 --> 21:20.703
But... I mean, thanks.

21:22.147 --> 21:23.205
Take care.

21:23.515 --> 21:24.777
Can I give you a lift?

21:24.916 --> 21:26.076
Oh! That's OK.

21:26.218 --> 21:27.879
I have to meet Sasha
in Bloomsbury so...

21:28.020 --> 21:29.180
That's where I'm headed!

21:29.821 --> 21:31.083
OK.

21:31.323 --> 21:32.984
- Get in!
- Thank you.

21:42.134 --> 21:44.295
Oh, Talullah! There you are!

21:44.436 --> 21:46.404
This is Klaus Fassbinder.

21:46.538 --> 21:48.301
Klaus, this is
my daughter Talullah.

21:48.440 --> 21:49.907
And this is her best friend, Paul.

21:50.042 --> 21:52.306
- It's Peter, Mother!
- It's all right.

21:52.444 --> 21:55.004
Darling, you could have
worn something nicer.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.274
You could have worn something.
Full stop.

21:58.317 --> 22:01.878
Sorry, Fassbinder, are you
related to the director?

22:02.020 --> 22:05.080
- Who?
- Oh, never mind.

22:05.223 --> 22:07.487
Mrs. Wentworth, thank you
so much for this invitation.

22:07.626 --> 22:09.890
Oh please! Call me Felicity!

22:10.028 --> 22:11.586
David is perfect
for you, darling!

22:11.730 --> 22:14.699
I can't think why I didn't
set you two up earlier!

22:14.833 --> 22:17.199
So, you're Felicity's daughter?

22:17.336 --> 22:19.497
Only by birth.
So don't hold it against me.

22:19.638 --> 22:21.697
Donatella!
Excuse me.

22:24.743 --> 22:27.803
Whoever designed those heels
must really hate women.

22:28.447 --> 22:30.381
I designed those heels.

22:31.216 --> 22:32.774
And thank goodness you did!

22:32.918 --> 22:35.887
Otherwise Mother's arse
would be dusting the floor.

22:41.426 --> 22:43.894
So how long have you
and Sasha been together?

22:44.029 --> 22:44.893
3 months.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.895
Really?
How did you two meet?

22:48.033 --> 22:51.491
- It's a bit embarrassing actually.
- Oh go on. Tell me.

22:52.637 --> 22:55.003
We met at a beach party
at lpanema.

22:56.742 --> 22:59.609
Sasha wanted to take my picture.
I said no.

22:59.745 --> 23:01.804
He pestered me.
And one thing led to another.

23:01.947 --> 23:03.107
And...

23:04.015 --> 23:05.277
Well, here I am.

23:05.417 --> 23:07.476
Sasha's a wonderful photographer.

23:07.619 --> 23:08.984
Yes. So everyone says.

23:09.121 --> 23:10.884
You're not interested in
photography?

23:11.022 --> 23:14.389
Oh, very much.
I studied it at university.

23:14.526 --> 23:18.292
But I'm more into reportage.
Capturing real moments.

23:18.430 --> 23:20.295
Sasha's brilliant at capturing
real moments.

23:20.432 --> 23:21.490
Don't you think?

23:22.834 --> 23:24.096
Not really.

23:24.236 --> 23:27.399
I think Sasha's brilliant
at creating moments.

23:27.539 --> 23:29.097
Most of which aren't real.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.004
But then again,
fashion isn't real,

23:31.143 --> 23:34.010
so maybe he's capturing
reality after all.

23:34.146 --> 23:35.113
What do you think?

23:37.516 --> 23:40.383
I think people shouldn't bite
the hand that feeds them.

23:41.219 --> 23:42.777
Excuse me?

23:42.921 --> 23:46.084
I mean, thanks to a chance
encounter at a beach party,

23:46.224 --> 23:49.091
you hook up with one of
the world's top fashion photographers.

23:49.227 --> 23:51.286
First class travel,
exotic locations.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.694
You really hit quite the jackpot.

23:53.832 --> 23:54.992
You think that's why I'm with him?

23:55.133 --> 23:57.795
Well, it's obviously not
out of respect for his work.

23:58.537 --> 24:00.505
Do you always judge people
so quickly?

24:00.639 --> 24:01.606
I'm notjudging you.

24:01.740 --> 24:02.707
No?

24:02.841 --> 24:04.706
Then maybe you're judging Sasha.

24:04.843 --> 24:06.003
You seem to think
the only reason

24:06.144 --> 24:08.704
someone might be with him is
for this 'jackpot.'

24:12.417 --> 24:13.475
This is fine.

24:18.824 --> 24:19.882
Thanks for the ride.

24:27.132 --> 24:30.590
I would like to welcome you
all to this year's

24:30.735 --> 24:34.603
'Fashion Against the lmpending
Threat of Global Warming.'

24:37.843 --> 24:42.212
There is nothing more important
right now, than global poverty.

24:42.347 --> 24:45.874
I mean in the warming sense.

24:46.017 --> 24:48.485
Actually, I was just talking
to Donatella.

24:49.221 --> 24:52.190
- Sorry, I'm late. So is he here?
- Not yet.

24:52.324 --> 24:53.985
- Where's Talullah?
- In the bathroom.

24:54.125 --> 24:56.389
She's been eating large
quantities of hash brownies.

24:56.528 --> 24:57.495
- Again?
- Yeah.

24:57.629 --> 25:01.793
So with no further ado,
I would like to introduce

25:01.933 --> 25:03.798
any available
British celebrity!

25:05.537 --> 25:08.995
I mean...
Angus Deaton!

25:20.619 --> 25:22.587
- Bitch!
- Wanker!

25:22.721 --> 25:24.985
Thank you and thank you
to Felicity for all her.

25:25.123 --> 25:29.685
Jacks! You look so pretty!

25:29.828 --> 25:32.888
I think you're very,
very pretty Jacks.

25:33.031 --> 25:34.396
Thank you, Talullah.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.296
I think you're very pretty too.

25:36.434 --> 25:38.994
But not as pretty as
Freedom's wife!

25:39.137 --> 25:41.196
I'm sure you're far prettier
than Freedom's wife.

25:41.339 --> 25:43.705
You're just saying that
because you're a POOF!

25:43.842 --> 25:45.810
Talullah!
What's wrong with you?

25:45.944 --> 25:47.104
Genetics.

25:48.246 --> 25:50.874
- Hello, Jones.
- It's Jacks, Mother!

25:51.016 --> 25:54.281
- You look lovely!
- Thank you. So do you!

25:54.419 --> 25:55.477
I don't!

25:55.620 --> 25:57.281
I'm pasty white.

25:58.723 --> 26:00.691
Why wasn't I born black?

26:01.126 --> 26:03.686
OK, first up then
we have an outfit called

26:03.828 --> 26:07.696
Ice Dream donated by
Klaus Fassbinder!

26:10.135 --> 26:13.502
Let's start the bidding.
If you would at 1,000 pounds.

26:13.638 --> 26:14.297
Thank you, sir.

26:14.439 --> 26:16.805
David's flight from New York
must have been delayed.

26:16.942 --> 26:19.001
But he should be here
at any minute.

26:19.945 --> 26:22.004
He was very intrigued by
what I told him!

26:22.147 --> 26:23.774
What, what you told him?

26:23.915 --> 26:25.678
You know, about how you saw
him at the hotel

26:25.817 --> 26:28.786
and it was love at first sight!
And what a catch you are.

26:28.920 --> 26:31.889
How it's about time you found
yourself a nice boyfriend!

26:33.725 --> 26:35.090
You told him all that?

26:35.927 --> 26:38.293
He seemed very flattered Paul!

26:38.430 --> 26:40.091
1,500 pounds.

26:40.231 --> 26:44.292
Any advance on 1,500 pounds?

26:44.436 --> 26:47.303
Going once, going twice...

26:47.439 --> 26:49.907
10,000 pounds!

26:51.643 --> 26:55.409
10,000 pounds!

26:55.547 --> 26:56.980
Don't touch the dress!

26:58.416 --> 27:00.577
Any advance on 10,000 pounds.

27:01.219 --> 27:02.481
No?

27:02.621 --> 27:04.987
Going once. Going twice!

27:06.124 --> 27:07.489
10,000 pounds!

27:13.732 --> 27:16.599
I was only joking.
I was just kidding!

27:17.936 --> 27:22.396
I was only joking.
It was a joke.

27:23.441 --> 27:24.499
Charity!

27:34.619 --> 27:36.883
Hello?
Oh, hi James.

27:37.022 --> 27:39.786
- Do I live here?
- No, I live here.

27:39.924 --> 27:41.585
Oh, how do you do?

27:48.233 --> 27:50.292
Oh, Peter, I feel so bad.

27:50.435 --> 27:51.595
C'mon, drink this.

27:51.736 --> 27:52.998
No, I mean about you.

27:53.138 --> 27:56.596
Not getting to meet
Robbie Williams because of me.

27:56.741 --> 27:57.799
It's OK.

28:08.119 --> 28:12.681
<i>#I'm loving angels instead...</i>

28:12.824 --> 28:14.985
- How's our patient?
- She'll live.

28:15.126 --> 28:18.186
- Well, I have great news!
- Oh yes, what?

28:18.329 --> 28:21.196
- You know James is in New York.
- Yes, that is great news.

28:21.332 --> 28:24.790
Who guess he ran into at one of
the Art Auctions over there.

28:25.537 --> 28:28.199
- Who?
- David Williams!

28:28.339 --> 28:31.103
OK! Please, please tell me
he didn't say anything!

28:31.242 --> 28:33.301
- Was he not meant to say anything?
- Oh, my god!

28:33.445 --> 28:34.810
News of my crush has just
travelled across

28:34.946 --> 28:36.106
the Atlantic Ocean!

28:36.247 --> 28:38.977
David Williams must think
I'm a needy, desperate freak!

28:39.117 --> 28:41.881
Well, there's no point in pretending
to be something you're not!

28:43.621 --> 28:44.986
Where do you think you're going?

28:45.423 --> 28:48.085
I just remembered.
I need a pedicure.

28:48.226 --> 28:52.185
Talullah. I think just this once,
you should paint your own toenails.

28:52.330 --> 28:53.797
Don't be ridiculous!

28:53.932 --> 28:57.493
I need a lot more incentive
to bend over that far.

29:02.140 --> 29:03.607
There's nail polish here.

29:03.742 --> 29:07.303
- Oh, are we at the salon?
- Yes.

29:29.033 --> 29:31.297
- Ready for lunch?
- Sure am!

29:31.436 --> 29:33.597
Is everything OK?

29:33.738 --> 29:36.104
Oh yeah. Fine.
T-cells unchanged.

29:36.241 --> 29:37.606
Liver holding up.
Everything's great.

29:37.742 --> 29:40.108
So despite your fragile beauty,
you're actually built like an ox.

29:40.245 --> 29:41.212
Go figure.

29:41.346 --> 29:43.109
Did you hear the news
about David?

29:43.248 --> 29:45.273
Yes. Talullah's Mother told me
he never even showed.

29:45.416 --> 29:47.179
Which actually proves
my theory he must think

29:47.318 --> 29:48.182
I'm a stalker freak.

29:48.319 --> 29:50.480
I'm sure he doesn't think that.

29:50.622 --> 29:53.386
Fin, in 3 short weeks he's heard
about my desperate obsession

29:53.525 --> 29:55.789
from you, from Talullah's mother,
and now from James,

29:55.927 --> 29:57.292
all the way in New York!

29:57.428 --> 29:58.486
Read this!

30:00.131 --> 30:01.996
David didn't show because
he had to stay in New York.

30:02.133 --> 30:05.000
Because he was promoted to
Sotheby's New York office.

30:05.136 --> 30:06.103
Satisfied?

30:07.539 --> 30:09.598
I can't believe I drove him
out the country.

30:09.741 --> 30:10.799
Come on.

30:20.018 --> 30:21.076
Jacks.

30:22.520 --> 30:23.987
Have you ever thought
this whole 'true love' thing

30:24.122 --> 30:25.180
might be a conspiracy?

30:25.323 --> 30:27.791
- A conspiracy?
- Yeah, a capitalist conspiracy.

30:27.926 --> 30:31.487
A lie concocted by the Film,
Publishing and Music industries.

30:31.629 --> 30:34.393
All pushing this thing, this
concept that doesn't even exist!

30:34.532 --> 30:36.397
True love doesn't exist?

30:36.835 --> 30:37.802
Well, think about it.

30:37.936 --> 30:39.904
Where is it besides songs,
books and films?

30:40.038 --> 30:43.007
I mean, who can honestly say
'I will always love you? '

30:43.141 --> 30:45.200
- Whitney Houston?
- Yeah, when she's high on crack.

30:45.343 --> 30:47.709
The point is, Everyone's miserable
because they're looking for

30:47.846 --> 30:49.814
this nonexistent 'thing,'
or else they're miserable

30:49.948 --> 30:51.882
because they think they've
settled for less.

30:52.016 --> 30:54.484
I'm not miserable.
And I believe in true love.

30:54.619 --> 30:57.179
Yeah, which is why you're still
sleeping with your ex-boyfriend.

30:57.322 --> 30:59.586
'Breakfast at Tiffany's' is on.
Wanna watch?

30:59.724 --> 31:02.887
I just told you films have
destroyed my ability to love.

31:03.027 --> 31:04.494
I thought that was your mother.

31:05.129 --> 31:06.892
Good point. Shove over.

31:15.039 --> 31:16.700
This is your favorite film?

31:16.841 --> 31:18.308
Look at me. Can't you tell?

31:46.838 --> 31:48.203
- Where's Daphne?
- Out.

31:48.339 --> 31:49.897
Can I give her a message?

31:50.041 --> 31:52.100
These are the contact sheets
from the shoot.

31:52.243 --> 31:53.210
I've marked my selects.

31:53.344 --> 31:55.403
Tell Daphne my assistant
Paolo is handling the retouching,

31:55.546 --> 31:57.377
so if she needs any other prints,
she can call him at the lab.

31:57.515 --> 31:58.174
OK.

31:58.316 --> 32:01.080
And if she needs me,
I'll be at my boyfriend's in Paris.

32:01.219 --> 32:03.687
- Paolo?
- What about him?

32:04.122 --> 32:05.885
Paolo isn't your boyfriend?

32:06.024 --> 32:08.686
Why would you think
he was my boyfriend?

32:08.826 --> 32:11.488
I just assumed.
Talking to Paolo.

32:11.629 --> 32:13.392
- Really?
- I'm sorry.

32:14.332 --> 32:16.095
No need to be sorry, carino!

32:16.234 --> 32:18.998
You're not the first person
who gets this impression from Paolo.

32:19.137 --> 32:22.698
To be honest, I think maybe
he had a little crush on me.

32:22.840 --> 32:26.799
I'm very flattered of course,
and if I wasn't already involved.

32:26.945 --> 32:28.606
But, you know,
it's all about timing, no?

32:28.746 --> 32:31.681
And right now, I have a train
to catch! Ciao ciao!

32:34.419 --> 32:35.886
Ciao, ciao.

32:45.930 --> 32:47.591
These look great.

32:47.732 --> 32:48.892
Paolo.

32:50.335 --> 32:52.599
Look, I'm sorry about
the other night.

32:52.737 --> 32:55.797
Sasha told me everything
and I feel like an idiot.

32:56.741 --> 32:58.299
Could you please forgive me?

32:59.944 --> 33:01.002
Yes.

33:01.646 --> 33:02.510
You don't know me.

33:02.647 --> 33:04.877
If you did, you'd know
I'd never take advantage of Sasha.

33:05.817 --> 33:07.079
Anyway. I should go.

33:07.919 --> 33:08.977
Have a good weekend.

33:10.421 --> 33:11.479
You, too.

33:21.332 --> 33:24.301
- So how do I get to know you?
- What?

33:24.435 --> 33:26.995
- How about over a cup of coffee?
- A cup of coffee?

33:27.138 --> 33:28.696
It's the least I could do
after the other day!

33:28.840 --> 33:32.105
Besides, we can't have you all
alone in London on a Friday night!

33:32.243 --> 33:34.006
You make me sound like
an exchange student.

33:34.145 --> 33:36.113
- I didn't mean it like that.
- No?

33:36.247 --> 33:39.375
Then why else would someone like
you want to have a coffee with me?

33:39.517 --> 33:40.575
Someone like me?

33:40.718 --> 33:42.879
It's OK. Really.
I forgive you.

33:43.021 --> 33:46.582
So you can stop feeling sorry
for me or guilty or whatever.

33:46.724 --> 33:48.885
I'm sure you have better things
to do on a Friday night.

33:51.729 --> 33:56.189
Actually, 'someone like me' has
nothing to do on a Friday night. OK?

33:56.334 --> 33:59.303
Oh, but wait, now you're going to
say 'someone like me'

33:59.437 --> 34:02.998
only wants to have
coffee with you

34:03.141 --> 34:05.701
because I've got nothing
better to do.

34:05.843 --> 34:09.973
I just can't win can I?
Never mind.

34:10.114 --> 34:14.175
To tell you the truth,
'someone like me' hates coffee.

34:14.318 --> 34:16.183
I hate coffee too.

34:17.121 --> 34:18.679
Este...

34:18.822 --> 34:20.585
Where did you learn to
speak Spanish like that?

34:20.725 --> 34:23.284
What? Not what you'd expect
from 'someone like me? '

34:24.027 --> 34:25.393
I find you very confusing.

34:25.530 --> 34:28.498
So does my boyfriend.
My ex-boyfriend.

34:30.534 --> 34:32.002
Do you want to get a drink?

34:32.136 --> 34:33.603
There's this amazing place
near here.

34:33.737 --> 34:35.501
Tonight's South American night.

34:38.543 --> 34:41.909
OK. But only because I feel
sorry for myself,

34:42.045 --> 34:43.980
and I know you must feel guilty.

34:46.717 --> 34:49.481
I really appreciate you
seeing me on such short notice.

34:49.620 --> 34:50.985
Finlay thinks the world of you.

34:51.121 --> 34:53.590
And I think THE WORLD of Finlay!

34:56.828 --> 34:58.295
Yes, well...

34:58.429 --> 35:01.398
He said you really sorted him
out on the relationship front.

35:01.532 --> 35:03.693
And I could certainly use
some help there.

35:03.835 --> 35:07.498
You see I've never actually
been in a relationship

35:07.638 --> 35:08.798
except in my own head.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.407
And how long did that last?

35:11.042 --> 35:13.510
- What?
- The relationship in your head.

35:14.345 --> 35:15.903
No. I mean,
it's an ongoing problem.

35:16.047 --> 35:19.778
They only last in my head.
For varying amounts of time.

35:19.917 --> 35:21.976
So you have a problem
with monogamy?

35:22.520 --> 35:26.786
No, no that.
No, that's not my problem.

35:26.924 --> 35:30.690
Denial is not a river in Egypt!

35:31.329 --> 35:34.787
Not a river in Egypt.
D'you see what I did there?

35:34.932 --> 35:38.390
Just that's a little therapistjoke.
Doesn't always work.

35:38.536 --> 35:40.504
- OK, right. Paul?
- Peter.

35:40.638 --> 35:42.196
- Sorry?
- Peter.

35:42.340 --> 35:45.503
Peter. Peter. Yes, it is.
You're absolutely right. Peter.

35:45.643 --> 35:49.010
That's a good start.
Well done you!

35:49.147 --> 35:50.580
I think I can help you.

35:50.715 --> 35:52.683
- You do?
- I do.

35:52.817 --> 35:55.479
I think you are stuck in
that pre relationship

35:55.620 --> 35:58.783
moment of infatuation
and you need to be reminded

35:58.923 --> 36:02.689
that a real relationship has
many, many, many more stages.

36:02.827 --> 36:04.590
Stages. I like that.

36:04.729 --> 36:09.189
Relationships are best measured
by farting.

36:10.635 --> 36:11.602
Excuse me?

36:11.736 --> 36:15.297
The stages of a relationship
can be defined by farting.

36:15.439 --> 36:18.306
Stage 1 is the conspiracy of silence.

36:18.442 --> 36:22.310
This is a fantasy period
where both parties pretend

36:22.446 --> 36:25.074
that they have no bodily waste.

36:25.216 --> 36:27.878
This illusion is very quickly
shattered by that first shy

36:28.019 --> 36:32.683
'ooh did you fart? ' followed by
the sheepish admission of truth.

36:32.823 --> 36:35.986
This heralds a period of
deeper intimacy.

36:36.127 --> 36:39.893
A period I like to call
the 'fart honeymoon'.

36:40.031 --> 36:44.092
Where both parties find each
other's gas just the cutest thing

36:44.235 --> 36:45.702
in the world.

36:45.836 --> 36:49.602
But of course no honeymoon
can last forever.

36:51.242 --> 36:55.201
And so we reach the critical
fork in the fart.

36:55.346 --> 36:58.975
Either the fart loses its power
to amuse and embarrass,

36:59.116 --> 37:02.483
thereby signifying
true love or else,

37:02.620 --> 37:06.078
it begins to annoy and disgust.

37:06.224 --> 37:11.287
Thereby symbolizing all
that is blocked and rancid

37:11.429 --> 37:12.987
in the formerly beloved.

37:13.130 --> 37:14.688
Do you see what I'm getting at?

37:16.033 --> 37:18.797
Peter? Peter?

37:18.936 --> 37:19.994
Earth to Peter?

37:20.137 --> 37:20.694
- What?
- Sorry I'm late.

37:20.838 --> 37:23.204
I was talking to Tony.

37:23.341 --> 37:24.308
Who's Tony?

37:24.442 --> 37:27.309
You know. Tony.
From the phone company.

37:27.445 --> 37:29.310
You're seeing your
obscene phone caller?

37:29.447 --> 37:31.176
Of course I'm not
'seeing him', darling.

37:31.315 --> 37:34.375
We're having a strictly
phone-based relationship.

37:34.518 --> 37:35.678
So what's going on?

37:36.721 --> 37:38.985
Finlay thinks I should
see his therapist.

37:39.123 --> 37:40.283
Finlay sees a therapist?

37:40.424 --> 37:43.188
Yeah, some woman he says is
really good with relationships.

37:43.327 --> 37:44.692
Maybe I should see her.

37:44.829 --> 37:47.798
I think I need to get in touch
with my inner child.

37:48.432 --> 37:50.093
Talullah, if you get in touch
with your inner child

37:50.234 --> 37:51.701
you're going to need
an inner nanny.

37:51.836 --> 37:54.396
Oh, I don't trust nannies.
They're all whores!

37:54.538 --> 37:56.802
- What about Mary Poppins?
- Slut!

37:56.941 --> 37:58.602
What are you talking about?

37:58.743 --> 38:00.711
She left the convent,
married Christopher Plummer,

38:00.845 --> 38:02.904
and then took all his children
up the Alps.

38:04.315 --> 38:06.579
Speaking of The Sound of Music,
where's Jacks?

38:11.922 --> 38:14.390
The riots completely
shut down Buenos Aires.

38:14.525 --> 38:16.083
It was unbelievable!

38:16.227 --> 38:18.593
The whole country,
rich, poor, young, old,

38:18.729 --> 38:20.890
everyone for this one moment,
came together.

38:21.032 --> 38:24.001
- These are incredible!
- The moment was incredible.

38:24.135 --> 38:25.898
You captured the moment.

38:26.037 --> 38:29.097
My friend Finlay owns an art gallery.
I'd love to show these to him.

38:29.240 --> 38:31.299
- That's very kind of you but...
- Very kind of me? What?

38:31.442 --> 38:33.103
You think you're some
kind of charity case?

38:33.244 --> 38:36.407
- No, but... I just...
- Don't tell me you're afraid.

38:37.415 --> 38:38.473
I'm afraid you're drunk.

38:38.616 --> 38:39.878
Because I think you're talented?

38:40.017 --> 38:42.577
Because you've had
3 caiperinhas.

38:44.021 --> 38:47.479
- Do you know how to tango?
- Yeah. Why?

38:47.625 --> 38:49.593
Because, everyone knows
you can't be drunk and tango.

38:49.727 --> 38:51.592
So if I can tango,
then I'm not drunk.

38:51.729 --> 38:55.392
And I get to show your pictures
to Finlay.

38:55.533 --> 38:57.501
Well, then you're right
and I won't tell a soul.

39:00.338 --> 39:01.396
Tambien...

39:29.233 --> 39:31.292
So about my friend Finlay.

40:09.740 --> 40:11.708
- So tell me your secret.
- What secret?

40:11.842 --> 40:14.208
How an American can speak
like a Spaniard and dance

40:14.345 --> 40:15.607
like an Argentinean.

40:16.647 --> 40:18.672
- I'm not American.
- No?

40:18.816 --> 40:21.979
Well, not technically.
I was born in England.

40:22.119 --> 40:24.679
My Father was English.
My Mother was Spanish.

40:24.822 --> 40:28.383
I grew up with my Mother's
family in America.

40:28.526 --> 40:30.391
After my parents died.

40:34.932 --> 40:38.197
How old were you
when you moved to America?

40:38.335 --> 40:39.393
Five.

40:39.537 --> 40:42.005
- I'm sorry I didn't mean to pry.
- It's not that.

40:42.940 --> 40:46.706
It's just I don't want to be
one of those awful characters

40:46.844 --> 40:51.474
out of a movie that gushes out
their past while the violins play.

40:52.917 --> 40:56.080
I mean I had a bad age five.

40:56.220 --> 40:58.688
I had a terrible age five,
actually.

40:59.523 --> 41:04.187
But all in all, since then,
my life's been pretty blessed.

41:18.042 --> 41:20.408
- So do you live alone?
- No, I live with Peter.

41:20.544 --> 41:23.479
- Oh? Your boyfriend?
- Oh God no! He's my best friend.

41:23.614 --> 41:26.981
We went to college together.
He's gay.

41:27.117 --> 41:28.584
All the good ones are...

41:31.522 --> 41:34.286
You should meet him actually.
He's a brilliant writer.

41:34.425 --> 41:36.393
Screenplays.
Well, that's the goal at least.

41:36.527 --> 41:39.496
He's just the sweetest,
funniest, kindest guy I know.

41:39.630 --> 41:41.598
If he wasn't gay, I'd have
married him years ago.

41:41.732 --> 41:43.597
- He sounds wonderful.
- He is!

41:45.636 --> 41:47.194
What are you doing tomorrow?

41:47.338 --> 41:50.102
Tomorrow? Nothing.

41:50.241 --> 41:51.503
You wanna have dinner?

41:52.243 --> 41:53.301
Oh, sure!

41:53.444 --> 41:55.605
Great!
Come over at 8!

41:58.716 --> 41:59.876
Ta da!

42:00.718 --> 42:02.686
Well, I had an amazing
time tonight.

42:02.820 --> 42:03.878
Me, too.

42:05.322 --> 42:06.380
Bye!

42:16.333 --> 42:18.494
<i>I've never been for a walk</i>
<i>in the morning before.</i>

42:18.636 --> 42:20.297
<i>At least, not since I've been</i>
<i>in New York...</i>

42:20.638 --> 42:21.900
- Hey, babies!
- Hi!

42:22.039 --> 42:24.007
- What are you doing?
- Watching 'Breakfast at Tiffany's.'

42:24.141 --> 42:26.006
- Again?
- Yeah, I'm doing research.

42:26.143 --> 42:27.508
Stop doing research
and would you write

42:27.645 --> 42:29.112
your goddamn screenplay!

42:29.246 --> 42:31.680
Did you realize, in the book,
the male character's gay?

42:31.815 --> 42:33.373
That's why they have such
an amazing friendship.

42:33.517 --> 42:35.075
Because she feels safe with him.

42:35.219 --> 42:38.677
Whereas in the film, he's straight
and she just wears gorgeous hats.

42:38.822 --> 42:42.781
Speaking of gorgeous, I just met
the cutest Argentinean boy.

42:42.927 --> 42:44.189
Oh, yeah?

42:44.328 --> 42:46.091
He's absolutely gorgeous.

42:46.230 --> 42:48.994
And sweet and smart.
And an amazing tango dancer!

42:49.133 --> 42:50.600
That's very useful
in today's world.

42:50.734 --> 42:53.703
Who also happens to be
an exceptionally talented photographer.

42:53.837 --> 42:56.499
Oh! Does this mean
we're finally over James?

42:56.640 --> 42:59.006
- James? He's gay!
- James is gay?!

42:59.143 --> 43:01.304
No, Paolo.
Paolo is gay.

43:01.445 --> 43:04.380
He's been assisting for Sasha,
you know the fashion photographer

43:04.515 --> 43:06.676
and I thought that they were,
you know, sleeping together

43:06.817 --> 43:07.784
but now they're not.

43:07.918 --> 43:10.182
And he really wants to meet you.
He doesn't know anyone in London.

43:10.321 --> 43:11.982
And I told him that you'd
have dinner with him...

43:12.122 --> 43:13.885
- What?
- Tomorrow. It'll be good for you.

43:14.024 --> 43:15.491
It'll take your mind off.

43:15.626 --> 43:18.094
Jacks! There is absolutely
no way I am going

43:18.228 --> 43:19.695
on another blind date.
The answer's no!

43:22.833 --> 43:23.993
Paolo! Hi!

43:24.134 --> 43:25.499
Come in! Come in!

43:26.637 --> 43:28.298
I'm afraid I'm running late!

43:28.439 --> 43:31.306
Oh, these are lovely,
but Peter hates flowers.

43:31.442 --> 43:32.306
We'll pretend they're for me.

43:32.443 --> 43:33.808
Can I get you something to drink?

43:33.944 --> 43:35.206
Champagne?

43:35.346 --> 43:36.677
Sure.

43:36.814 --> 43:38.281
So, how was your Saturday?

43:39.016 --> 43:40.074
- Paolo?
- What?

43:40.217 --> 43:41.980
What did you do today?

43:42.119 --> 43:44.280
Oh, yeah.
I went to the Tate.

43:44.421 --> 43:46.787
The Museum.
The Tate Modern Museum.

43:46.924 --> 43:48.789
- Your first time?
- Yep.

43:48.926 --> 43:50.484
And? What did you think?

43:50.628 --> 43:53.688
I mean, it's pretty
amazing visually. Right?

43:53.831 --> 43:55.389
The way it's built.

43:55.532 --> 43:58.000
Isn't itjust visually stunning?

43:58.135 --> 43:59.397
Don't you think, Paolo?

44:00.437 --> 44:01.199
Yeah!

44:01.338 --> 44:03.704
Paolo, I can't hear you.
Can you come back here?

44:03.841 --> 44:05.308
I don't want to have to scream.

44:11.915 --> 44:14.383
So what else did you?
After the Tate Modern?

44:14.518 --> 44:16.782
I'm sorry, I didn't...
I'll just close the door.

44:16.920 --> 44:17.682
Oh, it's fine!

44:17.821 --> 44:19.482
Peter and I always have
our best conversations

44:19.623 --> 44:20.487
when I'm in the bath.

44:20.624 --> 44:21.886
- Peter?
- Jacks?

44:22.026 --> 44:23.186
Shit!

44:23.327 --> 44:25.192
- Jacks!
- I'll be right out!

44:25.329 --> 44:27.695
- Is that Peter?
- No. James. Do me a favour.

44:27.831 --> 44:28.991
Go out and tell him
I'll be out in 5.

44:29.133 --> 44:30.498
And close the door behind you.

44:36.140 --> 44:38.199
Hi, sorry, I...
Jacks is in the bath.

44:38.342 --> 44:39.809
She says she'll be out in 5.

44:39.943 --> 44:41.808
- Who are you?
- Paolo Sarmiento.

44:41.945 --> 44:43.378
I, I work with Jacks.

44:45.115 --> 44:47.379
- James!
- Peter. Hi.

44:47.518 --> 44:50.078
- Hello?
- Hi, Peter. I'm Paolo.

44:50.220 --> 44:51.084
Paolo. Hi.

44:51.221 --> 44:53.280
Hi! I've heard so much about you.

44:53.424 --> 44:54.482
Really?

44:55.225 --> 44:58.194
- Where's, where's Jacks?
- In the bath, apparently.

44:58.328 --> 45:01.092
Right. Excuse me for a second?

45:10.741 --> 45:12.902
- What's he doing here?
- He just flew back from New York.

45:13.043 --> 45:14.010
Not James. Paolo!

45:14.144 --> 45:17.079
- He's having dinner with you.
- No! No. No way.

45:17.214 --> 45:18.476
Why not?
Give me one good reason.

45:18.615 --> 45:20.276
- It's too soon.
- Too soon?

45:20.417 --> 45:22.681
- I'm still not over David.
- You don't even know David.

45:22.820 --> 45:23.582
That's a technicality.

45:23.721 --> 45:25.086
Besides, after everything
everyone's said,

45:25.222 --> 45:26.280
I feel like I know him very well.

45:26.423 --> 45:28.687
Babies, David doesn't even live
in London anymore.

45:28.826 --> 45:29.884
Oh, so you're saying
I should forget about him

45:30.027 --> 45:31.085
purely for geographic reasons?

45:31.228 --> 45:33.093
I'm saying that I don't think
it's healthy for you to have

45:33.230 --> 45:34.288
a long distance relationship
with someone

45:34.431 --> 45:36.194
you've never even met!

45:36.333 --> 45:37.994
How does that look?
More blush?

45:38.135 --> 45:39.796
- No, you're good.
- Thank you.

45:41.638 --> 45:45.301
I'm afraid Jacks sort of
surprised me with this.

45:45.442 --> 45:47.000
Yes. She surprised me too.

45:47.144 --> 45:50.079
Yeah, well, that's our Jacks!
Full of surprises!

45:51.115 --> 45:54.676
So is James...
Are they together?

45:56.620 --> 45:57.587
Well, technically no.

45:57.721 --> 45:59.780
But for all practical purposes, yes.

45:59.923 --> 46:01.686
- I don't understand.
- Join the club.

46:01.825 --> 46:04.885
When it comes to love, Jacks is
completely incomprehensible.

46:05.529 --> 46:08.293
So does she love him?

46:09.733 --> 46:10.700
I suppose, in a way, she must.

46:10.834 --> 46:13.598
I just don't think
she likes him very much.

46:13.737 --> 46:15.500
But come to think of it,
Jacks never goes out with men

46:15.639 --> 46:16.901
she actually likes.

46:19.543 --> 46:20.407
You're insane.

46:20.544 --> 46:22.512
Why, because I don't like you
having strange men with you

46:22.646 --> 46:23.578
while you're in the bath?

46:23.714 --> 46:27.775
- Jams, he's gay, for God sakes!
- Great, another poof.

46:27.918 --> 46:29.283
Since when did you
become homophobic?

46:29.419 --> 46:31.979
Since I realized being gay is
the only way to be intimate with you.

46:32.122 --> 46:33.589
Don't be absurd.

46:36.326 --> 46:38.988
I can't believe I've just
vomited the entire saga of

46:39.129 --> 46:41.495
my imaginary love life
with David Williams.

46:41.632 --> 46:43.099
I enjoyed it.
It's like a movie.

46:43.233 --> 46:45.895
- Yeah, but you must think I'm crazy.
- Yes.

46:46.036 --> 46:47.594
But I like crazy people.

46:47.738 --> 46:50.400
Yeah? So do I.

46:53.343 --> 46:56.403
But enough about me.
What do you think about me?

46:57.214 --> 47:00.980
No, I'm joking.
No, I'm not. No, I was.

47:07.324 --> 47:09.690
Sam, can we have some
sambucca, please?

47:25.242 --> 47:26.800
- Don't answer.
- I really should.

47:26.944 --> 47:28.912
- Why?
- It might be somebody.

47:31.014 --> 47:34.780
Hello? Talullah! Oh sweetie.
Hold on a sec.

47:34.918 --> 47:36.886
It's Talullah.
She's having a crisis.

47:37.020 --> 47:38.487
How bloody unusual.

47:39.623 --> 47:42.888
OK. Tell me exactly
what happened.

47:43.026 --> 47:44.994
He's stopped calling.

47:45.128 --> 47:46.789
- Freedom?
- Tony.

47:46.930 --> 47:47.988
Who's Tony?

47:48.131 --> 47:51.498
You know.
Tony from the phone company.

47:51.635 --> 47:54.103
The psycho who was
making obscene calls?

47:54.238 --> 47:57.696
They weren't obscene!
They were sweet.

47:57.841 --> 48:00.105
It was the perfect relationship.

48:00.244 --> 48:04.772
I never felt ugly or fat.
I knew he wasn't with me for my money.

48:04.915 --> 48:07.383
- I miss him, Jacks!
- Talullah, don't be ridiculous.

48:07.517 --> 48:09.178
I can't help how I feel!

48:09.319 --> 48:11.378
Why is it as soon as
I fall in love with a man,

48:11.521 --> 48:13.079
he abandons me?

48:13.223 --> 48:15.088
You don't love Tony!

48:15.225 --> 48:17.989
Yes I do!
I do love Tony.

48:19.129 --> 48:20.289
What did I do wrong?

48:20.430 --> 48:23.490
OK. Let's indulge this
sick fantasy.

48:23.634 --> 48:26.603
What's the last thing
you said to Prince Charming?

48:26.737 --> 48:29.103
'Stop pestering me
or I'll call the police! '

48:35.646 --> 48:36.874
Oh, this is us.

48:38.415 --> 48:41.077
Do you want to come upstairs
for another drink?

48:41.218 --> 48:43.379
I want to,
but I probably shouldn't.

48:43.520 --> 48:45.283
I have to be at the lab at 7.

48:46.223 --> 48:50.785
- Oh, OK. Well...
- But I really enjoyed meeting you.

48:52.729 --> 48:53.787
So did I.

48:56.033 --> 48:57.091
So did I.

49:00.737 --> 49:02.796
- Are you OK here?
- Oh my God! Oh God!

49:02.940 --> 49:04.202
- You don't! I...
- I'm so sorry!

49:04.341 --> 49:06.901
I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry. I was just...

49:07.044 --> 49:09.205
- I'm really embarrassed.
- No, no, no, listen, Peter.

49:09.346 --> 49:10.677
I really like you a lot, but...

49:10.814 --> 49:12.076
But you don't like me
in that way.

49:12.215 --> 49:13.580
Look, I know that speech.

49:13.717 --> 49:15.878
I use that speech because
I actually wrote that speech...

49:16.019 --> 49:17.486
I'm not gay.

49:17.621 --> 49:20.089
- I didn't write that part!
- I'm straight.

49:21.825 --> 49:22.883
Since when?

49:24.227 --> 49:27.094
I suppose I first noticed
when I was around 8.

49:27.230 --> 49:29.494
I thought it was just a phase,
you know, but eventually

49:29.633 --> 49:32.693
I had to accept the truth.
I like women.

49:34.137 --> 49:36.901
Oh this is good!
This is really good.

49:37.040 --> 49:39.099
You know, Jacks is useless at
fixing people up...

49:39.242 --> 49:41.301
- Jacks thought I was gay?
- Oh she sure did.

49:41.445 --> 49:43.777
And I'm really going to enjoy
making her feel stupid about this one.

49:43.914 --> 49:46.075
No! Please don't.

49:47.718 --> 49:49.379
I think I should tell her myself.

49:54.524 --> 49:55.889
You and Jacks?

49:57.227 --> 49:58.888
You and, you and Jacks?

49:59.629 --> 50:00.493
Oh my God!

50:00.630 --> 50:03.997
Oh, look, I... I...
I won't say a word. I promise.

50:04.134 --> 50:05.795
- Thanks.
- Cross my heart.

50:07.337 --> 50:10.602
- I should go.
- Yeah. Yes.

50:10.741 --> 50:12.709
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

50:23.320 --> 50:25.083
So what did you say to Jacks
when you got back?

50:25.222 --> 50:27.383
- Nothing, she wasn't there.
- But you're going to tell her.

50:27.524 --> 50:28.286
Sorry, I'm late!

50:28.425 --> 50:31.189
I was in the middle of
an absolutely gripping book.

50:31.328 --> 50:32.090
I couldn't put it down.

50:32.229 --> 50:33.287
Oh, what book's that?

50:33.430 --> 50:36.194
My memoirs, darling.
I've decided to publish.

50:37.034 --> 50:38.899
Bloody Mary please.
Light on the bloody.

50:39.036 --> 50:40.799
- Where's Jacks?
- Spending the weekend with James.

50:40.937 --> 50:43.303
- Oh God, how disgusting!
- Be nice.

50:43.440 --> 50:46.898
I'm sorry, but James Wildstone stands
for absolutely everything I despise.

50:47.044 --> 50:48.511
I thought he was
a good friend of your family?

50:48.645 --> 50:49.407
Exactly my point.

50:49.546 --> 50:51.173
Well, we shouldn'tjudge.
Maybe he's good sex.

50:51.314 --> 50:53.782
Oh, don't be absurd.
He's public school.

50:53.917 --> 50:55.578
So he probably likes
being spanked.

50:55.719 --> 50:57.277
Or buggered. Or both.

50:57.421 --> 51:00.185
- Sounds like good sex to me.
- And me!

51:00.323 --> 51:01.688
And me actually.

51:03.527 --> 51:06.985
I can't believe he's so late!
Pandora, try Sasha's mobile.

51:07.130 --> 51:08.597
- I tried it 5 minutes ago.
- Try again.

51:08.732 --> 51:10.290
And leave another message.

51:10.434 --> 51:11.992
Do you have his boyfriend's
number in Paris?

51:12.135 --> 51:13.796
He got back from Paris
last night.

51:13.937 --> 51:15.495
He broke up with his boyfriend
this weekend.

51:15.639 --> 51:17.504
- He did? Is he OK?
- Not really.

51:17.641 --> 51:20.405
But Jacks, look, it'll be fine.
Sasha always turns up.

51:20.544 --> 51:23.104
- I left another message.
- Thanks, Pandora.

51:24.514 --> 51:27.381
So I had a nice evening
with Peter the other night.

51:27.517 --> 51:29.781
Oh my God! Really?
Isn't he great?

51:29.920 --> 51:32.286
Smart, funny and cute.

51:32.422 --> 51:34.890
Yes, he's absolutely lovely.

51:35.025 --> 51:35.889
Where's Daphne?

51:36.026 --> 51:38.290
She had to go to court today.
She left me in charge.

51:38.428 --> 51:40.089
Who put up those lights?

51:40.230 --> 51:41.891
I did, I thought you
might want them in the shot.

51:42.032 --> 51:45.399
You're not here to think!
You're here to do what I think! OK?

51:45.535 --> 51:48.197
So now you take all this down
and you bring me a ring light.

51:50.540 --> 51:53.703
Pandora?
Where is Pandora? Where is it?

51:53.844 --> 51:54.902
Here.

51:55.245 --> 51:56.212
What's yourjob?

51:57.214 --> 51:58.681
I'm a wardrobe assistant.

51:58.815 --> 52:01.784
A wardrobe assistant?
No, you're a piece of shit!

52:01.918 --> 52:03.886
How dare you call my mobile
every 10 minutes

52:04.020 --> 52:04.782
and leave me endless messages.

52:04.921 --> 52:07.185
I told her to call, Sasha!
We were worried.

52:07.324 --> 52:09.189
- You were late.
- I know I was late!

52:09.326 --> 52:11.294
I just don't need
a nobody leaving me

52:11.428 --> 52:12.793
endless messages about it!

52:12.929 --> 52:15.193
- I understand you had a rough weekend...
- No, you don't understand!

52:15.332 --> 52:16.697
You understand nothing!

52:16.833 --> 52:18.892
And I suggest you stop
meddling with things

52:19.035 --> 52:20.593
you don't understand,
and just do yourjob!

52:20.737 --> 52:21.704
Whatever the hell that is.

52:21.838 --> 52:23.100
I don't know,
go steam something!

52:23.240 --> 52:24.207
Sasha!

52:24.341 --> 52:25.308
Jacks, he doesn't mean that...

52:25.442 --> 52:28.309
- Don't you tell her what I mean!
- Don't speak to her like that.

52:31.715 --> 52:33.979
Get out! You're fired!
You heard me? You're fired!

52:34.117 --> 52:35.277
Go back to Argentina!

52:35.418 --> 52:37.784
You and your little
pathetic snapshots!

52:37.921 --> 52:38.979
Bye bye!

52:40.223 --> 52:42.783
Anyone else have
something to say?

52:43.426 --> 52:44.893
I have something to say.

52:46.630 --> 52:48.598
- Apologize!
- I'm sorry?

52:48.732 --> 52:50.996
I said apologize!

52:51.735 --> 52:53.600
- Are you insane?
- Obviously!

52:53.737 --> 52:56.103
I work at Vogue!
But don't change the subject!

52:56.239 --> 52:58.104
- Apologize.
- Or else?

52:58.241 --> 53:00.801
Or else, I'm walking out
with all those dresses.

53:01.945 --> 53:04.880
Oh! I have a better idea.
I will do the walking out thing.

53:05.015 --> 53:07.381
And let's see what Daphne
has to say about that!

53:16.526 --> 53:18.585
Paolo, can I ask a favour?

53:19.229 --> 53:22.494
Ah, the classic movie moment
when the underdog gets to prove

53:22.632 --> 53:25.192
his real worth and win
the heart of his true love!

53:25.335 --> 53:26.302
Don't give away the ending!

53:26.436 --> 53:28.802
It's a romantic comedy!
How do you think it ends?

53:30.040 --> 53:31.803
Hi, sunshine, how are you?

53:31.942 --> 53:34.206
I just had the most surreal day.

53:34.344 --> 53:35.504
I had a huge fight with Sasha.

53:35.645 --> 53:38.079
Paolo took over the shoot,
and he was absolutely brilliant.

53:38.215 --> 53:39.682
I'm probably going to
get fired tomorrow,

53:39.816 --> 53:41.681
but it was so worth itjust
to see Paolo in action.

53:41.818 --> 53:44.082
Oh my God! This is so scary!

53:44.221 --> 53:45.586
What's she watching?

53:45.722 --> 53:46.882
Notting Hill.

53:48.225 --> 53:49.385
So what did you think
about Paolo?

53:49.526 --> 53:50.788
Was I right or was I right?

53:50.927 --> 53:52.485
Are those my only options?

53:52.629 --> 53:54.187
Oh no, don't tell me
you didn't like him.

53:54.331 --> 53:56.492
I liked him a lot!
I'm just not sure I'm his type.

53:56.633 --> 53:57.600
Of course, you're his type!

53:57.734 --> 53:59.793
He told me himself
he thought you were 'lovely.'

53:59.936 --> 54:01.403
Well, I didn't see that coming!

54:01.538 --> 54:02.402
What?

54:02.539 --> 54:05.702
Julia Roberts ending up
with Hugh Grant!

54:12.415 --> 54:14.679
You know, Jacks. When I told you
to take care of the shoot,

54:14.818 --> 54:17.378
I was thinking more along
the lines of ordering the sushi,

54:17.520 --> 54:19.488
not enraging
our top photographer.

54:19.623 --> 54:21.887
I can't help it if Sasha's
an overpampered monster.

54:22.025 --> 54:25.392
We work in fashion.
Everyone's an overpampered monster.

54:25.528 --> 54:28.190
Yes, but that isn't an excuse
to be so vile to people.

54:28.331 --> 54:31.789
Besides, his pictures don't
have an ounce of truth to them.

54:31.935 --> 54:35.393
But since when does truth have
anything to do with fashion?

54:35.538 --> 54:38.302
Well, it doesn't.

54:38.441 --> 54:39.806
But maybe it should.

54:42.445 --> 54:44.970
- So you were Sasha's assistant?
- Yes.

54:45.115 --> 54:46.673
How very 'All About Eve.'

54:46.816 --> 54:48.579
'All About Eve? '

54:48.718 --> 54:49.878
It's a movie, darling.

54:50.020 --> 54:52.079
It's about an assistant
who seems all sweet and innocent

54:52.222 --> 54:54.884
but is really quite
ambitious and ruthless.

54:55.025 --> 54:56.083
You should rent it sometime.

54:56.226 --> 54:57.591
Daphne, he was doing me
a favour.

54:57.727 --> 54:59.388
- I've seen it.
- You have?

54:59.529 --> 55:00.791
And what did you think?

55:00.930 --> 55:03.091
I found it rather silly actually.

55:03.233 --> 55:06.600
The idea that Bette Davis could be
the victim of anyone is absurd.

55:18.415 --> 55:19.882
Pick 4 and run it.

55:29.326 --> 55:31.590
Oh my God, Paolo!
You were amazing!

55:31.728 --> 55:32.888
Thanks. So were you!

55:33.029 --> 55:34.087
The way you handled Daphne!

55:34.230 --> 55:36.790
I mean I knew you were talented,
but I had no idea that under

55:36.933 --> 55:41.097
that shy, sweet exterior was
such steely confidence!

55:41.237 --> 55:43.705
What other secrets are
you keeping from me?

55:44.941 --> 55:47.501
Actually, Jacks,
I did want to talk to you about...

55:47.644 --> 55:50.374
- Ah, Jacks! There you are!
- James?

55:50.513 --> 55:51.775
Hello, Darling!

55:51.915 --> 55:53.280
Hello?

55:53.416 --> 55:55.077
James, you remember Paolo?

55:55.218 --> 55:56.583
Yes. Hello, Paolo?

55:56.720 --> 55:57.584
James?

55:57.721 --> 55:58.881
What are you doing here?

55:59.022 --> 56:00.785
Well, actually, I was just
having lunch across the street

56:00.924 --> 56:02.789
and I came to tell you
the good news in person.

56:02.926 --> 56:03.688
What good news?

56:03.827 --> 56:06.796
Peter is finally going to meet
the love of his life!

56:06.930 --> 56:08.898
- What?
- David Williams is in town.

56:09.032 --> 56:10.590
He's leading a special auction
at Sotheby's.

56:10.734 --> 56:11.701
And he and I were just
having lunch together,

56:11.835 --> 56:12.995
and I just happened to mention
Peter's name.

56:13.136 --> 56:16.105
And he suggested that we bring
Peter to the auction tonight!

56:16.239 --> 56:17.706
- He did?
- Well, actually, I suggested it.

56:17.841 --> 56:19.706
But he thinks it's a great idea!

56:19.843 --> 56:22.403
So did I do good
or did I do good?

56:22.545 --> 56:23.978
You did great.

56:26.316 --> 56:28.580
I should probably go.

56:29.018 --> 56:32.476
Paolo, congratulations on today.

56:34.524 --> 56:36.890
Tell Peter I wish him
good luck with David.

56:41.631 --> 56:42.791
Jacks?

56:43.733 --> 56:44.893
What are you thinking?

56:45.735 --> 56:48.704
I'm thinking about
Peter and David living

56:48.838 --> 56:50.499
happily ever after.

56:56.045 --> 56:58.172
What if I've written
the worst script ever?

56:58.314 --> 56:59.975
What if everyone hates it?

57:00.116 --> 57:03.085
Look, most great artists have to
deal with rejection in their lifetime.

57:03.219 --> 57:04.686
Yes, I'm not a great artist!

57:04.821 --> 57:07.381
Look, I know I'm not
some genius like Van Gogh.

57:07.524 --> 57:09.583
Thank God.
I like my men with 2 ears.

57:09.726 --> 57:11.387
I'm, I'm being serious.

57:11.528 --> 57:14.395
What if I'm not any good?
What if I have no talent?

57:14.531 --> 57:16.795
Are you asking
if I'll still love you?

57:17.934 --> 57:19.299
- Snap out of it will you?
- What?

57:19.836 --> 57:20.894
We're here.

57:26.142 --> 57:27.700
There you are!
You guys are late.

57:27.844 --> 57:29.311
Fin, I'm not sure
this is such a good idea.

57:29.446 --> 57:30.674
It's an excellent idea.

57:30.814 --> 57:32.179
He's perfect for you,
Paul, darling!

57:32.315 --> 57:34.783
Peter! His name is Peter!

57:34.918 --> 57:36.579
You're about to meet the
love of your life!

57:36.719 --> 57:37.276
To the left!

57:37.420 --> 57:38.887
There is no need to be
so nasty to me

57:39.022 --> 57:39.886
just because I don't remember
people's names.

57:40.023 --> 57:41.888
550 with you madam,
thank you very much.

57:42.025 --> 57:44.585
- That's him!
- 580. Anything further on 580?

57:44.727 --> 57:46.092
- I can't see him.
- There!

57:46.229 --> 57:48.288
I have £600,000.

57:48.431 --> 57:49.898
Back to the telephone bank.

57:50.033 --> 57:51.500
That's not him.
That's not him!

57:51.634 --> 57:52.896
- You're kidding?
- No!

57:53.036 --> 57:54.799
- That's David?
- No!

57:54.938 --> 57:55.597
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

57:55.738 --> 57:56.397
I have no idea!

57:56.539 --> 57:58.803
Of course that's David!
He's just cut his hair.

57:58.942 --> 57:59.704
What hair?

57:59.843 --> 58:01.003
He's got a lovely smile!

58:01.144 --> 58:03.476
- He's just cut his hair!
- And he's lost some weight.

58:03.613 --> 58:05.877
- I don't think so, Fergus...
- It's Finlay!

58:06.015 --> 58:07.573
- What?
- That is not him! OK?

58:07.717 --> 58:10.083
That is not the man
I bumped into at the Chancery Hotel.

58:10.220 --> 58:11.482
That is not him!

58:11.621 --> 58:13.282
Well, he's good enough!

58:13.423 --> 58:15.186
Oh no! No, he's not good enough!

58:15.325 --> 58:19.091
Because, that man right there,
the real David Williams actually exists!

58:19.229 --> 58:23.495
The real David Williams happens
to be a living, breathing,

58:23.633 --> 58:25.794
on-the-market gay man!

58:43.119 --> 58:46.088
Morning, sunshine.
How you feeling?

58:46.222 --> 58:48.986
- Exhausted. You?
- Fine.

58:49.125 --> 58:51.685
I'm going to brunch with Finlay
and the wrong David.

58:51.828 --> 58:53.386
I'm so sorry.

58:53.530 --> 58:54.792
Sorry you outed
a total stranger

58:54.931 --> 58:56.694
or sorry it's the wrong
total stranger?

58:56.833 --> 58:57.800
Both.

58:57.934 --> 58:59.094
I'm quite relieved, to be honest.

58:59.235 --> 59:00.497
At least it's over and done with.

59:01.437 --> 59:03.302
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

59:03.439 --> 59:06.602
I was just up most of
the night thinking...

59:06.743 --> 59:07.801
About?

59:07.944 --> 59:11.471
Oh, love and other disasters.

59:12.515 --> 59:14.380
- That must be Finlay.
- Send him my love.

59:14.517 --> 59:16.985
- I don't have to go to this thing.
- Go!

59:25.228 --> 59:26.286
I'll be right down.

59:32.135 --> 59:34.501
- Morning.
- Morning.

59:35.438 --> 59:38.202
- Would you like some coffee?
- No, thank you.

59:40.043 --> 59:42.511
That's Peter, he must have
forgotten his keys.

59:43.813 --> 59:45.178
I'm going to take a bath.

59:49.519 --> 59:50.884
Paolo, hi!

59:51.020 --> 59:52.885
- Hi.
- Are you OK?

59:53.823 --> 59:56.189
Not really.
I haven't slept all night.

59:56.326 --> 59:58.294
Come in. Come in.

59:59.629 --> 01:00:00.687
It's just...

01:00:01.831 --> 01:00:03.799
I've been wanting to talk to you
about the other night with Peter.

01:00:03.933 --> 01:00:08.097
But it seems every time I'm about to,
something or someone gets in the way.

01:00:08.237 --> 01:00:09.295
I'm sorry.

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:12.203
No! It's not your fault.
It's just...

01:00:13.743 --> 01:00:17.076
- He's not here, is he?
- No. No, he's out.

01:00:17.213 --> 01:00:18.077
Good.

01:00:18.214 --> 01:00:21.081
- I feel terrible.
Why should you feel terrible?

01:00:21.217 --> 01:00:23.378
I had no idea how you felt.

01:00:25.521 --> 01:00:26.579
What the hell is going on?

01:00:26.723 --> 01:00:28.782
- I don't believe it.
- No, wait!

01:00:28.925 --> 01:00:30.483
- I shouldn't have come.
- Wait!

01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:32.288
- James, what's wrong with you?
- Nothing's wrong with me!

01:00:32.428 --> 01:00:33.690
He needs to talk!
What's your problem?

01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:34.694
He's my problem!

01:00:34.831 --> 01:00:36.992
Excuse me? Paolo!

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:41.695
I may not speak Spanish,
but I'm not an idiot.

01:00:41.838 --> 01:00:42.702
What are you talking about?

01:00:42.839 --> 01:00:44.306
I'm talking about you
and that bloody Paolo.

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:46.305
He was upset about Peter.
He wanted to talk.

01:00:46.442 --> 01:00:47.500
Bullshit!

01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:49.111
- What?
- I want him out of your life!

01:00:49.245 --> 01:00:51.372
- Or else?
- Or else we're through!

01:00:51.514 --> 01:00:54.779
See. This is exactly why I don't
want to be in a relationship with you!

01:00:55.518 --> 01:00:56.985
Oh really?

01:00:57.120 --> 01:00:58.883
Then what the hell is this?
What the hell are we in?

01:00:59.622 --> 01:01:00.680
I don't know.

01:01:02.125 --> 01:01:03.990
This is just some sort of
fucking game to you, isn't it?

01:01:04.127 --> 01:01:04.684
What's a game?

01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:07.295
This. We fuck and then you say
you don't want a relationship.

01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:09.489
- It's not a game.
- Oh no? Then what is it?

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:11.391
It's...

01:01:12.435 --> 01:01:13.197
It's the truth.

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:15.497
Bullshit!
I don't believe it is the truth!

01:01:15.638 --> 01:01:17.105
For the last six months
you've been saying one thing

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:18.901
and then doing another.
You've been playing me!

01:01:19.042 --> 01:01:20.100
No!

01:01:21.144 --> 01:01:22.509
But I am sorry.

01:01:22.645 --> 01:01:23.873
What are you sorry about?

01:01:24.714 --> 01:01:26.181
I didn't mean to hurt you!

01:01:27.917 --> 01:01:29.680
Fucking condescending!

01:01:29.819 --> 01:01:31.582
I didn't mean it like that.

01:01:31.721 --> 01:01:34.281
I just... I want...

01:01:34.424 --> 01:01:35.482
What do you want?

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:39.290
I want this to end.

01:01:54.744 --> 01:01:57.178
So after all that,
I'm not the one?

01:01:57.313 --> 01:01:58.780
Bit of a relief, huh?

01:01:58.915 --> 01:01:59.973
I suppose so.

01:02:00.116 --> 01:02:01.481
You must have thought
I was a stalker freak.

01:02:01.617 --> 01:02:02.879
Thanks to my discreet friends.

01:02:03.019 --> 01:02:03.883
We were just trying to help.

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:05.681
Yes, by making me out to be
a desperate fantasist?

01:02:05.822 --> 01:02:07.483
You are a desperate fantasist.

01:02:07.623 --> 01:02:08.988
- No, I'm not actually.
- He is.

01:02:09.125 --> 01:02:11.593
I'm a fantasist,
I'm not desperate.

01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:13.696
Well, I suppose I'd never have
lived up to your fantasy anyway.

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:15.991
Trust me, David.
Nobody could.

01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:18.191
- Tom!
- Sorry, I'm late!

01:02:19.936 --> 01:02:22.404
- Tom, this is Peter and Finlay.
- Hey, Tom. I think we've met.

01:02:22.538 --> 01:02:25.996
- Finlay! How have you been?
- Great! And you?

01:02:26.142 --> 01:02:28.110
Can't complain.
Can't complain.

01:02:28.244 --> 01:02:29.711
Finally out of the art world!

01:02:29.846 --> 01:02:30.870
Tom's acting now.

01:02:31.013 --> 01:02:32.275
- Acting?
- Yeah, that's why I'm late.

01:02:32.415 --> 01:02:34.076
Had an audition for
a new drama at the BBC.

01:02:34.217 --> 01:02:36.276
- How'd it go?
- Good! Well, great actually.

01:02:36.419 --> 01:02:39.388
I was so inside
the character. You know?

01:02:39.522 --> 01:02:40.580
And then they asked for a monologue

01:02:40.723 --> 01:02:42.987
so I did that one from
Streetcar which everyone loves.

01:02:43.126 --> 01:02:46.095
The actress I was doing it with,
she was hopeless.

01:02:46.229 --> 01:02:47.196
I was doing my best...

01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:48.388
Are you OK?

01:02:50.032 --> 01:02:51.397
- That's him.
- Who?

01:02:51.534 --> 01:02:53.399
That's the guy I bumped into
at the Hotel!

01:02:53.536 --> 01:02:54.594
What?

01:02:55.738 --> 01:02:56.397
Sorry.

01:02:56.539 --> 01:03:00.305
Excuse me, I just need to use
the loo, actually.

01:03:00.443 --> 01:03:02.502
- Finlay?
- Right! I'll just...

01:03:03.246 --> 01:03:04.270
Give you a hand!

01:03:07.517 --> 01:03:09.178
I can't believe you said
'I'll give you a hand! '

01:03:09.318 --> 01:03:10.580
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.881
But listen, I think
I know what happened!

01:03:13.022 --> 01:03:15.081
Tom used to be
David's assistant.

01:03:15.224 --> 01:03:16.486
They both must have gone
to the hotel,

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:18.389
but Tom arrived with
the paintings on his own.

01:03:18.528 --> 01:03:19.688
Which is when you bumped
into him!

01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:21.592
Great! So, now what do I do?

01:03:22.231 --> 01:03:24.096
Well, I'd probably zip up.

01:03:24.934 --> 01:03:26.401
Mustn't seem over-eager.

01:03:27.637 --> 01:03:30.401
I can't believe you're cooking dinner
for some guy you just met yesterday!

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:32.303
His name is Tom.
You know what they say.

01:03:32.441 --> 01:03:34.102
'The way to a man's heart is
through his stomach.'

01:03:34.243 --> 01:03:35.608
Don't you think that's aiming
a bit high?

01:03:35.745 --> 01:03:37.474
Don't you think you should
applaud my courage?

01:03:37.613 --> 01:03:39.376
I would but my hands are full.

01:03:39.715 --> 01:03:40.875
Anyway, I'm off.

01:03:41.017 --> 01:03:42.279
Don't you at least
want to meet Tom?

01:03:42.418 --> 01:03:44.386
Why? I prefer Paolo.

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:46.681
Maybe that's something
worth considering.

01:03:46.823 --> 01:03:47.983
Little late for that.

01:03:56.632 --> 01:03:58.395
I've been trying to call you
since yesterday

01:03:58.534 --> 01:03:59.899
but your mobile isn't working.

01:04:00.036 --> 01:04:01.799
I, I ran out of credit.

01:04:02.738 --> 01:04:05.002
- Can I come in?
- Yeah, sure.

01:04:05.942 --> 01:04:06.909
What are you doing?

01:04:07.043 --> 01:04:09.511
I have to fly back to
Argentina tomorrow.

01:04:09.645 --> 01:04:11.977
- What? Why?
- I don't belong here.

01:04:12.114 --> 01:04:13.274
What are you talking about?

01:04:13.416 --> 01:04:15.077
Your career's about to
take off in London.

01:04:15.218 --> 01:04:17.277
You have 4 pages in the new Vogue!

01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:18.887
OK, I know how you feel
about fashion.

01:04:19.021 --> 01:04:19.680
And I agree with you!

01:04:19.822 --> 01:04:21.585
But at least it'll pay the rent.
While you do your own work.

01:04:21.724 --> 01:04:25.490
And I've spoken to Finlay.
And he wants to meet you.

01:04:25.628 --> 01:04:27.892
Maybe put a show on at
his gallery for you.

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:30.294
- You can'tjust go home now!
- I'm being deported.

01:04:31.534 --> 01:04:33.502
Immigration got a tip
I was working here illegally.

01:04:33.636 --> 01:04:36.605
- A tip? From who?
- Does it matter?

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.098
James.

01:04:39.842 --> 01:04:41.002
It was James.

01:04:41.143 --> 01:04:42.405
We don't know that.

01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:47.376
- You're not going.
- Jacks, I don't have a choice.

01:04:48.417 --> 01:04:49.884
Yes, you do.

01:04:50.019 --> 01:04:51.179
You can marry me!

01:04:54.523 --> 01:04:57.686
Jacks. I can't ask you
to do that.

01:04:57.827 --> 01:04:59.089
Then it's a good thing I'm asking!

01:04:59.228 --> 01:05:02.197
Yes. And it's very kind of you.
But...

01:05:02.632 --> 01:05:04.293
It's not fair to you.

01:05:05.434 --> 01:05:07.902
Look. I know you think I'm
doing this out of guilt or pity.

01:05:08.037 --> 01:05:09.095
But that's just not true.

01:05:09.238 --> 01:05:11.798
I'm doing this
because I want to.

01:05:11.941 --> 01:05:14.501
Because I know that you're on the
verge of fulfilling your dreams!

01:05:14.644 --> 01:05:17.374
And if I could be a part of that,
that would make me happy.

01:05:17.513 --> 01:05:21.176
And I don't want you to go.
So please. Marry me!

01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:26.188
I don't know what to say.

01:05:26.322 --> 01:05:30.281
Well, unless you want me to feel
totally humiliated say yes.

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:37.593
I'm like, fuck that.
I know I'm talented.

01:05:37.733 --> 01:05:39.792
I don't need some RADA degree
to tell me.

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:40.800
You know what I mean?

01:05:41.437 --> 01:05:42.699
And besides,
I'm not interested in

01:05:42.838 --> 01:05:44.703
being some luvvie
character actor.

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:47.308
I am a leading man,
for fuck's sake.

01:05:47.443 --> 01:05:49.809
So why waste my time studying
during my peak years.

01:05:49.946 --> 01:05:50.776
You know what I mean?

01:05:52.014 --> 01:05:55.177
Yes, yes.
Well, I, I think I do.

01:05:55.318 --> 01:05:57.786
I mean sometimes studying can
become a way of avoiding doing...

01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:00.081
I'm just not sure whether
I should cut my hair.

01:06:00.923 --> 01:06:03.289
I mean, my agent thinks I should,
but I think it's what makes me

01:06:03.426 --> 01:06:05.087
distinctive.
You know what I mean?

01:06:05.828 --> 01:06:07.193
Yeah. I think I do.

01:06:07.830 --> 01:06:09.798
So... you wanna go to bed?

01:06:10.833 --> 01:06:11.390
What?

01:06:11.534 --> 01:06:14.196
Do you want to go to bed?
You know, have sex?

01:06:14.337 --> 01:06:15.395
I...

01:06:16.238 --> 01:06:18.206
I don't like wasting time
when I know what I want.

01:06:24.313 --> 01:06:25.871
Is everything OK?

01:06:26.015 --> 01:06:29.075
Yes, I was just trying Peter,
but he didn't answer.

01:06:29.218 --> 01:06:31.880
Oh, you ordered me another drink.
Thanks, Babies!

01:06:32.021 --> 01:06:33.488
You're so thoughtful!

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:37.486
So what happened
with you and James?

01:06:37.626 --> 01:06:39.992
The same thing that happens
with all straight men.

01:06:40.129 --> 01:06:42.791
They pretend that they're fine
with you having a career

01:06:42.932 --> 01:06:43.796
and being independent.

01:06:43.933 --> 01:06:47.391
But deep down, they resent it.
Or they want to change it.

01:06:47.536 --> 01:06:49.504
Well, not all straight men.

01:06:49.638 --> 01:06:52.106
Trust me! All of them!

01:06:52.241 --> 01:06:55.301
At the end of the day, all
straight men just want one thing.

01:06:55.444 --> 01:06:56.502
You know what that is?

01:06:57.213 --> 01:06:58.475
Sex?

01:06:58.614 --> 01:06:59.672
Control!

01:06:59.815 --> 01:07:01.680
The problem with straight men
is that no matter how hard

01:07:01.817 --> 01:07:04.183
they try, they still
need to control, to dominate.

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:05.787
Thank God you're gay!

01:07:06.722 --> 01:07:08.280
- Jacks.
- I mean think about it!

01:07:08.424 --> 01:07:10.085
Why do you think we feel
so comfortable together?

01:07:10.226 --> 01:07:12.387
Because I know you're not
trying to score.

01:07:12.528 --> 01:07:15.691
Anyway. I'm through
with straight men!

01:07:15.831 --> 01:07:17.298
A toast!

01:07:17.433 --> 01:07:19.901
No more straight men!

01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:21.901
Good riddance I say!

01:07:22.738 --> 01:07:25.605
And now, we have a very special
dedication for Paolo.

01:07:25.741 --> 01:07:28.403
Paolo, this one's from
your future wife!

01:07:35.718 --> 01:07:37.982
Happy Wedding, Babies!

01:08:22.531 --> 01:08:26.399
I just remembered that Peter
might have a boy at the house.

01:08:26.535 --> 01:08:29.902
Can I stay at yours?
Sunderland Terrace!

01:08:34.143 --> 01:08:35.201
Thanks.

01:08:41.317 --> 01:08:43.581
Oh my god, I just used
your toothbrush.

01:08:43.719 --> 01:08:44.981
No problem.

01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:46.486
I think I'm drunk.

01:08:48.323 --> 01:08:50.587
The room's sloshing.

01:08:52.127 --> 01:08:54.095
You going to stand up all night?

01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:57.398
- No.
- Good. Come.

01:08:59.935 --> 01:09:02.995
I think my parents would
have really liked you.

01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:10.477
You're so smart and kind
and you're so really talented.

01:09:11.412 --> 01:09:12.880
- Jacks!
- I think you're exactly

01:09:13.015 --> 01:09:15.279
the kind of person they would
have wanted me to marry.

01:09:15.417 --> 01:09:17.885
Well, not exactly.

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:20.682
But not in terms of what counts.

01:09:23.024 --> 01:09:26.688
I know that I don't know
you very well,

01:09:26.828 --> 01:09:29.093
but I feel safe with you.

01:09:29.231 --> 01:09:31.198
Is that crazy?

01:09:31.332 --> 01:09:33.301
No. It's not crazy.

01:09:34.136 --> 01:09:35.398
I trust you.

01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:39.000
Jacks, I need to tell
you something.

01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:41.506
- Get into bed and tell me.
- I can't.

01:09:41.644 --> 01:09:44.477
I promise I won't make a pass.

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:47.582
- It's not you I'm worried about.
- What, Paolo?

01:10:01.931 --> 01:10:03.694
You're so drunk!

01:10:28.624 --> 01:10:29.682
Tom.

01:10:32.328 --> 01:10:35.092
Tom! It's time to get up.

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:38.894
- What time is it?
- Almost 9.

01:10:40.936 --> 01:10:42.198
You gotta go.

01:10:43.339 --> 01:10:45.307
- Excuse me?
- You gotta go.

01:10:45.441 --> 01:10:48.410
I've got some friends
coming over for brunch.

01:10:49.945 --> 01:10:51.469
Tom, you're in my apartment.

01:11:18.841 --> 01:11:20.502
Talullah, I can't get
into it now.

01:11:20.643 --> 01:11:22.304
Just meet me at the Registry.

01:11:22.444 --> 01:11:24.776
I'm not getting married
without a maid of honour.

01:11:24.913 --> 01:11:28.280
No! Sweetie, you don't need
to write a poem.

01:11:29.318 --> 01:11:31.684
Look, I have to try Peter again.

01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:33.685
He hasn't been answering
the phone all night.

01:11:34.323 --> 01:11:35.984
OK, bye.

01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:43.593
- Hello?
- Peter! Finally!

01:11:43.732 --> 01:11:46.098
- Hi, Jacks.
- I've been calling you all night!

01:11:46.235 --> 01:11:48.203
I know, I'm sorry.
I turned my phone off.

01:11:48.337 --> 01:11:50.100
- Tim spend the night?
- Tom!

01:11:50.239 --> 01:11:53.208
- Whatever.
- I agree. Reality crashes in.

01:11:53.342 --> 01:11:55.708
I'm sorry, Babies.
Now listen.

01:11:55.844 --> 01:11:58.779
I need you to come down to
the Islington Registry right away.

01:11:58.914 --> 01:12:01.178
- I'm getting married.
- What? Jacks!

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:02.875
I'll tell you everything
when you get there.

01:12:03.018 --> 01:12:05.486
I just managed to get
a cancellation at 11 sharp.

01:12:05.621 --> 01:12:06.485
That's in 20 minutes!

01:12:06.622 --> 01:12:08.180
And I still need to
buy a wedding outfit!

01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:09.985
- Gotta run. Bye!
- Oh, wait!

01:12:11.226 --> 01:12:12.784
Oh, pull over right there!

01:12:15.631 --> 01:12:16.689
I'll be right back!

01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:37.485
Paolo! Thank God you're here!

01:12:37.619 --> 01:12:38.779
- Have they called our names yet?
- No.

01:12:38.921 --> 01:12:42.880
Emily Jackson
and Paolo Sar-mentio?

01:12:52.735 --> 01:12:54.896
Are you all here for
the Jackson wedding party?

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.581
If anyone knows why these
two individuals before me

01:13:13.722 --> 01:13:15.383
should not be married,
let them speak now

01:13:15.524 --> 01:13:16.491
or forever hold their peace.

01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:18.991
- I'm not gay.
- Excuse me?

01:13:19.128 --> 01:13:20.186
I'm not gay!

01:13:23.732 --> 01:13:25.791
Of course you're not gay!

01:13:25.934 --> 01:13:28.698
He's not! Gay. I mean.

01:13:30.038 --> 01:13:31.300
How nice for both of you.

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:33.803
Now, if there's any other
reason why...

01:13:33.942 --> 01:13:35.705
And I think I'm
in love with you.

01:13:35.844 --> 01:13:37.778
- What?
- I mean, I'm in love with her.

01:13:37.913 --> 01:13:39.574
- Paolo, what are you doing?
- Telling the truth.

01:13:39.715 --> 01:13:42.582
I'm not gay and I think
I'm in love with you.

01:13:42.718 --> 01:13:44.276
I know I should have said
something before.

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:46.581
But every time when I started,
it seemed like the wrong time.

01:13:46.722 --> 01:13:50.283
Or maybe I didn't
have the courage.

01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:52.087
But then when you suggested
getting married.

01:13:52.227 --> 01:13:54.991
I just got swept up with the idea
because I wanted more than

01:13:55.130 --> 01:13:58.497
anything to stay.
I wanted to stay with you.

01:13:58.634 --> 01:14:00.795
I know I should have said
something but...

01:14:00.936 --> 01:14:04.303
But, What? You wanted to make a fool?
Out of me first?

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.101
Jacks. You know that's not true.

01:14:06.241 --> 01:14:08.209
I have no idea what's true!

01:14:08.343 --> 01:14:11.073
- Oh, Jacks.
- I trusted you!

01:14:11.213 --> 01:14:14.182
I told you things.
I was naked in your bed!

01:14:14.316 --> 01:14:15.874
Did you know about this?

01:14:16.718 --> 01:14:17.685
- Yes.
- You?

01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:18.787
- No!
- I told you!

01:14:18.921 --> 01:14:20.889
Yes! And now I've lied.

01:14:21.924 --> 01:14:23.983
I can't believe
I trusted any of you!

01:14:25.527 --> 01:14:27.586
Jacks! Please...

01:14:31.834 --> 01:14:32.892
Next.

01:14:39.341 --> 01:14:41.605
- Go away!
- I'm coming in.

01:14:43.412 --> 01:14:45.676
I should be very mad at you.

01:14:45.814 --> 01:14:46.781
I'm sorry.

01:14:48.617 --> 01:14:51.177
I'm just so stupid!
How could I be so stupid?

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:53.788
You're not stupid, you just saw
what you wanted to see.

01:14:53.922 --> 01:14:55.480
I can't believe I trusted him!

01:14:55.624 --> 01:14:57.592
I can. He's a great guy.
He deserves your trust.

01:14:57.726 --> 01:14:58.886
Don't you dare defend him!

01:14:59.027 --> 01:15:01.587
Look, all I'm saying is what's
really changed about Paolo

01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:02.992
since he told you he was straight?

01:15:03.131 --> 01:15:04.996
- Everything!
- Yes, everything you're used to.

01:15:05.133 --> 01:15:06.395
Everything you're
comfortable with.

01:15:06.535 --> 01:15:07.297
What's that supposed to mean?

01:15:07.436 --> 01:15:09.404
Have you ever considered you
didn't want to see

01:15:09.538 --> 01:15:11.096
how Paolo really felt about you?

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.605
Because that would have
meant breaking your rule.

01:15:12.741 --> 01:15:14.299
- What rule?
- To only have sex with people

01:15:14.443 --> 01:15:17.776
you don't love and to only really
love people you don't have sex with.

01:15:18.714 --> 01:15:20.079
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

01:15:20.215 --> 01:15:23.082
Because that way you know
you can't really get hurt.

01:15:24.219 --> 01:15:27.484
Look, Paolo hasn't changed.
He's still the same person.

01:15:27.623 --> 01:15:30.183
He's still the same person
you know and believe in.

01:15:30.325 --> 01:15:33.988
And think is kind and smart
and sweet and bloody sexy.

01:15:35.330 --> 01:15:38.390
The only thing that's changed is
what might happen between you.

01:15:42.938 --> 01:15:44.405
And he can tango!

01:15:55.117 --> 01:15:56.675
God, babies. You were so right!

01:15:56.818 --> 01:15:59.480
I mean when I think about it now,
he tried to tell me so many times.

01:15:59.621 --> 01:16:01.782
And I just wouldn't let him.
I didn't want to hear it.

01:16:01.924 --> 01:16:03.585
I didn't want to see it!
I was so blind!

01:16:03.725 --> 01:16:04.783
Watch out!

01:16:09.831 --> 01:16:12.391
- What time is it?
- 5:30. What time's his flight?

01:16:12.534 --> 01:16:14.297
6! Hold on, babies.

01:16:38.927 --> 01:16:40.690
- Ticket?
- Oh, I'm not flying.

01:16:40.829 --> 01:16:42.387
Only ticketed passengers
past this point.

01:16:42.531 --> 01:16:44.192
Yes, but I need to speak to
someone on the BA flight

01:16:44.333 --> 01:16:45.994
to Buenos Aires.
It's an emergency!

01:16:46.134 --> 01:16:47.795
Try the BA's customer
service counter.

01:16:47.936 --> 01:16:50.200
- They can call the gate.
- You're a genius!

01:16:52.541 --> 01:16:55.009
I have an emergency message for someone
on your flight to Buenos Aires.

01:16:55.143 --> 01:16:57.077
Flight to Buenos Aires?

01:17:00.215 --> 01:17:03.378
I'm sorry but that flight's
already pulled out of the gate.

01:17:03.518 --> 01:17:05.179
It had an early departure.

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:06.981
An early departure?

01:17:11.526 --> 01:17:14.290
An early departure?
What are the chances of that?

01:17:14.429 --> 01:17:17.398
If this was a movie, there
wouldn't be an early departure.

01:17:18.533 --> 01:17:21.093
If this was a movie,
you'd be blonde!

01:17:21.236 --> 01:17:23.397
If this was a movie,
you'd be famous!

01:17:24.239 --> 01:17:26.707
That's the problem with life,
it's nothing like the movies.

01:17:31.513 --> 01:17:33.276
I can't believe
you're really going.

01:17:33.415 --> 01:17:35.383
I'm following your advice.
I'm breaking my rules.

01:17:35.517 --> 01:17:36.575
Good for you!

01:17:36.718 --> 01:17:37.980
Are you sure you're
going to be OK?

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:40.486
Jacks! I'm not a child,
I'll be fine.

01:17:40.622 --> 01:17:42.681
- I worry about you, Babies.
- You worry about everyone.

01:17:42.824 --> 01:17:44.689
No, I worry about you more.

01:17:44.826 --> 01:17:46.384
I just don't want you
to end up alone.

01:17:46.528 --> 01:17:49.588
Well, neither do I.
And stop being so dramatic!

01:17:49.731 --> 01:17:52.199
So stop living your life
like you're in some kind of movie.

01:17:52.334 --> 01:17:53.301
Excuse me?

01:17:53.435 --> 01:17:56.097
Stop trying to cast your true
love instead ofjust meeting him.

01:17:56.238 --> 01:17:58.604
- When I meet him, I'll know.
- I'm not so sure.

01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:00.503
Love isn't always
a lightning bolt, you know?

01:18:00.642 --> 01:18:02.701
Maybe sometimes
it's just a choice.

01:18:02.844 --> 01:18:03.868
Well, that's easy for you to say!

01:18:04.012 --> 01:18:06.173
You're flying to Argentina
to meet the love of your life!

01:18:06.314 --> 01:18:08.874
That's just it. I don't know
that Paolo's the love of my life'

01:18:09.017 --> 01:18:11.281
but I've decided to give him
the chance to be.

01:18:12.921 --> 01:18:14.479
Maybe true love is a decision.

01:18:14.623 --> 01:18:16.784
You know, a decision to take
a chance with somebody.

01:18:16.925 --> 01:18:18.290
To give to somebody.
Without worrying whether

01:18:18.427 --> 01:18:19.985
they'll give anything back.
Or if they're gonna hurt you,

01:18:20.128 --> 01:18:21.891
or if they really are the one.

01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:24.999
Maybe love isn't something
that happens to you.

01:18:25.133 --> 01:18:27.499
Maybe it's something
you have to choose.

01:18:27.636 --> 01:18:28.796
So what do I do?

01:18:28.937 --> 01:18:31.098
Well, you could start by
putting all of those fantasies of

01:18:31.239 --> 01:18:34.800
true love where they belong
into your work of fiction.

01:18:58.834 --> 01:19:00.199
'Love and Other Disasters.'

01:19:00.335 --> 01:19:01.802
Nice title. Catchy.

01:19:01.937 --> 01:19:05.805
But it'll never fit on the marquee.
How aboutjust 'Love Disasters? '

01:19:05.941 --> 01:19:07.101
What?

01:19:07.242 --> 01:19:08.607
I love that Jacks.

01:19:08.744 --> 01:19:11.372
She's got that British
quirkiness audiences love.

01:19:11.513 --> 01:19:12.673
'Hello, Babies! '

01:19:12.814 --> 01:19:15.180
Yes, but technically she speaks
with an American accent

01:19:15.317 --> 01:19:16.375
because she's grown up
in America so...

01:19:16.518 --> 01:19:18.782
Nah, it's too complicated.
Let's make her English.

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:21.184
- Perfect part for Gwyneth!
- Gwyneth Paltrow?

01:19:21.323 --> 01:19:23.689
Finest English actress of
her generation!

01:19:25.227 --> 01:19:27.787
Brainstorm!
Orlando Bloom as the Mexican.

01:19:27.929 --> 01:19:28.987
Paolo's Argentinean!

01:19:29.131 --> 01:19:32.498
And we'll cover the American
angle with Drew and Cameron.

01:19:32.634 --> 01:19:35.194
Drew Barrymore and
Cameron Diaz? As who?

01:19:35.337 --> 01:19:36.599
Playing David and Tom.

01:19:37.339 --> 01:19:39.307
I'm sorry, you want me to
get rid of the gay story line?

01:19:39.441 --> 01:19:40.305
I don't want you to
get rid of anything!

01:19:40.442 --> 01:19:42.603
I'm just saying instead of
David and Tom,

01:19:42.744 --> 01:19:44.268
we have Daisy and Tina.

01:19:44.913 --> 01:19:46.380
- I...
- Also, you gotta fiddle with that ending.

01:19:46.515 --> 01:19:50.383
We need a bigger movie moment
when Jacks finally connects

01:19:50.519 --> 01:19:52.180
- with Paolo.
- Yes, but...

01:19:52.821 --> 01:19:55.289
Sorry, the whole point is
there is no big movie moment

01:19:55.423 --> 01:19:57.482
because they both discover
that true love is a process

01:19:57.626 --> 01:19:58.888
not an event.

01:20:00.428 --> 01:20:02.293
You know, Peter. I get it.

01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:05.297
This script is like
your baby, isn't it?

01:20:07.035 --> 01:20:08.900
Well, yes, I suppose it is...

01:20:09.437 --> 01:20:12.497
I understand that.
Believe me, I understand that.

01:20:13.241 --> 01:20:14.299
Come here.

01:20:15.043 --> 01:20:16.977
I want to give you some advice!

01:20:18.313 --> 01:20:22.079
You gotta kill your baby!
You gotta fuckin' kill your baby!

01:20:24.719 --> 01:20:27.279
Right. Thank you. Thank you.

01:20:36.431 --> 01:20:37.398
Sorry.

01:20:37.532 --> 01:20:39.193
- Peter!
- David! Hi!

01:20:39.334 --> 01:20:42.497
- How are you?
- Good, good. You?

01:20:42.637 --> 01:20:44.696
Great, I've managed to convince
Sotheby's to transfer me

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:47.308
back to London.
How's the writing going?

01:20:47.442 --> 01:20:50.070
Good, thanks, I've finally
finished a screenplay.

01:20:50.212 --> 01:20:51.770
Great! What's it about?

01:20:51.913 --> 01:20:54.381
Oh, it's just about some guy
who realizes he's been

01:20:54.516 --> 01:20:56.381
looking for love in
all the wrong places.

01:20:56.518 --> 01:20:59.282
- Like in hotel lobbies?
- Yes, or in his head.

01:21:00.021 --> 01:21:02.182
- Well, congratulations!
- Thank you, thank you.

01:21:02.324 --> 01:21:03.882
You may want to wait
until you've seen the film.

01:21:04.025 --> 01:21:07.688
I don't need to. I'm congratulating you
for having the courage to write it.

01:21:07.829 --> 01:21:11.788
How it turns out or even if
it turns out that's out of your hands.

01:21:12.734 --> 01:21:16.602
- Anyway, take care.
- Yes. You, too.

01:21:30.819 --> 01:21:32.787
It's on the left when we get out.

01:22:02.217 --> 01:22:03.275
David!

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:06.578
Peter?

01:22:07.322 --> 01:22:08.289
Are you OK?

01:22:08.423 --> 01:22:10.584
No. Actually, I'm very out of
shape and that nearly killed me.

01:22:10.725 --> 01:22:13.387
But I needed to tell you two things.

01:22:14.029 --> 01:22:17.590
First, I'm really sorry
I was so self-absorbed

01:22:17.732 --> 01:22:19.290
when I first met you at brunch.

01:22:19.434 --> 01:22:20.799
You don't have to
apologize to me.

01:22:20.936 --> 01:22:23.700
Oh, no, I'm not apologizing to you.
I'm sorry for my own sake.

01:22:23.838 --> 01:22:26.602
You see, I was so caught up
in my own head.

01:22:26.741 --> 01:22:29.005
I missed out on getting
to know you.

01:22:29.144 --> 01:22:33.274
And I would like to
get to know you.

01:22:33.415 --> 01:22:36.077
I mean if you'd be willing
to give me another chance?

01:22:36.217 --> 01:22:40.779
Maybe let me take you
out for dinner?

01:22:43.325 --> 01:22:44.383
Oh, I don't know.

01:22:45.226 --> 01:22:48.684
See, I've had this fantasy in my
head about having dinner with you.

01:22:49.531 --> 01:22:50.896
What if you don't live up to it?

01:22:56.137 --> 01:22:59.800
Oh well, then I'd just have
to keep taking you out

01:22:59.941 --> 01:23:01.499
until I get it right.

01:23:04.913 --> 01:23:06.278
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:23:06.414 --> 01:23:08.279
- French or Italian?
- I think Italian.

01:23:08.416 --> 01:23:09.474
Good.

01:23:30.438 --> 01:23:31.496
Paolo!

01:23:32.841 --> 01:23:33.899
Jacks!

01:23:54.029 --> 01:23:56.395
Paolo, I've been such
a bloody fool!

01:23:56.531 --> 01:23:57.896
Can you ever forgive me?

01:23:58.433 --> 01:24:02.392
Love means always forgiving.

01:24:03.238 --> 01:24:06.298
And I do love you, Paolo!
I do!

01:24:16.518 --> 01:24:18.679
They made me write that ending.

01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:21.084
Apparently, audiences demanded
that Jacks and Paolo have

01:24:21.222 --> 01:24:23.190
this big Hollywood moment.

01:24:23.324 --> 01:24:25.087
I loved that ending.

01:24:26.528 --> 01:24:28.894
How can you love that ending?
It's so artificial!

01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:30.793
It's a lot better than
what really happened!

01:24:30.932 --> 01:24:32.991
I agree, I don't think having
Jacks arrive in Argentina

01:24:33.134 --> 01:24:35.796
with a bad case of diarrhoea
would have had the same impact.

01:24:35.937 --> 01:24:37.302
I loved how I came across.

01:24:37.439 --> 01:24:39.304
You were played
by Drew Barrymore!

01:24:39.441 --> 01:24:41.705
Who totally captured my essence.

01:24:41.843 --> 01:24:44.277
Name was absolutely
brilliant in that.

01:24:45.814 --> 01:24:48.578
Well, I don't like to brag but
I really think I stole the movie!

01:24:48.716 --> 01:24:52.083
I mean, I was funny.
Touching. Eccentric. Real.

01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:54.381
If a little old for the part.

01:24:54.522 --> 01:24:56.683
And I have to applaud your decision
not to show me ending up with James.

01:24:56.825 --> 01:24:58.292
Why? Are you ashamed of
our relationship?

01:24:58.426 --> 01:24:59.188
No, of course not, darling.

01:24:59.327 --> 01:25:00.385
It's just that you were
the villain

01:25:00.528 --> 01:25:02.689
and itjust wouldn't have
felt very believable.

01:25:02.831 --> 01:25:05.299
- What a clever boy you are!
- Thank you.

01:25:05.433 --> 01:25:07.993
Making Talullah and her mother
look the same age!

01:25:08.136 --> 01:25:10.195
That's very modern, Paul!

01:25:10.338 --> 01:25:12.397
I'm so sorry!
My shoot went over!

01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:14.007
You just missed
the story of our lives.

01:25:14.142 --> 01:25:15.200
But with better lighting!

01:25:15.343 --> 01:25:17.971
Everyone knows I wasn't the one
who reported Paolo to immigration, right?

01:25:18.113 --> 01:25:18.772
Yes, darling, we know.

01:25:18.913 --> 01:25:19.971
Well, I think this calls for champagne!

01:25:20.115 --> 01:25:22.675
Oh, right! Claridge's, turn left!

01:25:32.327 --> 01:25:34.192
- Babies, what's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:25:34.329 --> 01:25:37.093
You wrote a screenplay.
And they made a movie out of it!

01:25:37.232 --> 01:25:39.496
I know and I should be grateful.
Look, I'm very lucky.

01:25:39.634 --> 01:25:41.693
It's just...
I don't know.

01:25:41.836 --> 01:25:43.997
I just wanted to tell the truth
and somewhere along the line

01:25:44.139 --> 01:25:45.299
it got mixed up with
a bunch of lies.

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:49.399
Nobody goes to the movies for
truth except possibly the French!

01:25:49.544 --> 01:25:52.479
The truth is way too complicated.
And unsatisfying.

01:25:52.614 --> 01:25:54.081
And hard to believe.

01:25:55.016 --> 01:25:56.381
- Oh, my God!
- What?

01:25:56.518 --> 01:25:58.281
- I think my waterjust broke.
- What?

01:25:58.419 --> 01:26:02.082
I know, it's impossible, right?
I'm not due for another 3 weeks!

01:26:03.224 --> 01:26:05.283
Paolo! Paolo!
She's having the baby now!

01:26:05.426 --> 01:26:07.894
Call an ambulance!
Call a taxi!
