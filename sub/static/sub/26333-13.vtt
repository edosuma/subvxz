00:01.330 --> 00:03.880
Previously on
"A Million Little Things"...

00:03.880 --> 00:04.920
Gary: I will do whatever
it takes to get you well,

00:04.920 --> 00:06.330
and we will fight this thing
together.

00:06.330 --> 00:07.580
I didn't make partner.

00:07.580 --> 00:08.580
Then why are you smiling?

00:08.580 --> 00:10.670
'Cause I just got
my life back.

00:10.670 --> 00:12.040
Can we talk
about last night?

00:12.040 --> 00:13.000
You've got to admit,
there's some advantages

00:13.000 --> 00:14.830
to me being off my meds.

00:14.830 --> 00:16.420
The commercial loan
that Jon took out

00:16.420 --> 00:18.210
was for some properties
he was underwater on.

00:18.210 --> 00:19.710
How much does he owe?

00:19.710 --> 00:22.710
$18 million.
And it's what you owe.

00:22.710 --> 00:24.880
Gary: We've got to be
missing something.

00:24.880 --> 00:25.880
The Jon I knew would not

00:25.880 --> 00:28.210
have left his family
like this -- no way.

00:28.210 --> 00:30.880
Katherine:
Someone's been making payments
to Jon's loan since he died.

00:30.880 --> 00:32.710
Ashley?
I'm looking
at the account right now.

00:32.710 --> 00:34.210
Rutledge Trust.

00:34.210 --> 00:35.710
Gary: Rutledge --

00:35.710 --> 00:36.710
It was a term we came up
with as a shorthand.

00:36.710 --> 00:39.120
For what?
Take care of my family.

00:39.120 --> 00:41.040
Please don't tell anybody
about this place.

00:41.040 --> 00:42.420
Your secret's
safe with me.

00:42.420 --> 00:45.710
-We need to talk.
-No, Ashley, we don't.

00:45.710 --> 00:48.080
You owe this to him!

00:51.790 --> 00:53.040
Good morning, Gus.

00:53.040 --> 00:54.540
Morning.

00:54.540 --> 00:57.540
Where are the guys?
Well, Marty called their rooms.

00:57.540 --> 00:59.880
I'm guessing
they overslept again.
That's interesting.

00:59.880 --> 01:02.540
The guys who were still up
three hours ago overslept.

01:06.750 --> 01:08.120
Everything okay?

01:08.120 --> 01:09.920
Uh, yeah, it's just Theo.

01:09.920 --> 01:12.420
Is he hurt?
No.

01:12.420 --> 01:15.250
He just hasn't been acting
like himself lately.

01:15.250 --> 01:16.670
I think something's
going on at school.

01:16.670 --> 01:18.080
Thanks.

01:18.080 --> 01:20.080
Mrs. Cleary said that

01:20.080 --> 01:21.920
he hasn't been hanging out
with his friends.

01:21.920 --> 01:24.080
You know, he's been going to
the library during recess.

01:24.080 --> 01:26.580
Well, you know --
Even more than usual.

01:26.580 --> 01:27.960
Have you asked him
about it?

01:27.960 --> 01:29.250
Yeah, he's not
really talking.

01:29.250 --> 01:30.750
I think he needs
some Dad Time.

01:30.750 --> 01:31.920
Well, we're coming
through today,

01:31.920 --> 01:33.290
on our way
to Connecticut.

01:33.290 --> 01:35.290
If you are up for it,
maybe you can meet up with us

01:35.290 --> 01:37.420
and Theo can spend
the night with me.

01:37.420 --> 01:39.750
A 7-year-old
on a tour bus?

01:39.750 --> 01:41.170
I'll talk to the guys.

01:41.170 --> 01:42.830
I promise they'll be
on their best behavior.

01:42.830 --> 01:45.330
What's up, assbags?!

01:45.330 --> 01:46.960
Did he just just say --

01:46.960 --> 01:49.120
I'll -- I'll -- I'll --
I'll talk to the guys.

01:49.120 --> 01:51.170
Ashley: This is Ashley.
Please leave a message.

01:51.170 --> 01:53.790
Ashley, call me back, please.

01:53.790 --> 01:55.540
Katherine said
you've been making payments

01:55.540 --> 01:58.000
on Jon's business loans?

01:58.000 --> 02:00.210
I have to know what's going on.
Please.
Sophie: Hey, Mom.

02:00.210 --> 02:02.500
We're about to lose our house.
Are we doing
this driving lesson?

02:02.500 --> 02:06.500
Mom, you said you'd take me
for my driving lesson today.

02:06.500 --> 02:10.460
You can't keep me locked
in this house forever.

02:13.830 --> 02:17.040
Look, I know you're wearing
that wig today for you,

02:17.040 --> 02:20.620
but how about you wear it
tonight for me?

02:21.620 --> 02:23.170
Can you tell me
what that says,

02:23.170 --> 02:25.290
'cause texting and driving
is very dangerous.

02:25.290 --> 02:27.670
Oh, says the guy who was eating
a bowl of cereal

02:27.670 --> 02:29.040
four minutes ago.

02:29.040 --> 02:31.210
Uh, it's from Delilah.

02:31.210 --> 02:33.250
She still hasn't heard
from Ashley.

02:33.250 --> 02:34.250
Something's going on.

02:34.250 --> 02:36.080
I left Ashley
three messages

02:36.080 --> 02:38.170
and she still
hasn't called me back.

02:38.170 --> 02:40.000
Ooh, stop sign.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.330
Quick, I'll finish
my Froot Loop milk.

02:49.330 --> 02:50.670
What? You said
you didn't want any.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.670
I don't. I just don't want to
be late for my screening.

02:52.670 --> 02:54.580
Trust me, I'm gonna get you
to the doctor in time

02:54.580 --> 02:56.670
to pay $28 for parking.

02:58.670 --> 03:01.080
Hey, it's gonna be fine.
You don't know that.

03:01.080 --> 03:05.170
So, please, just n-no more text
messages, no more sugary milk.

03:05.170 --> 03:08.790
And no falsetto singing all
the lady parts from "Hamilton."

03:08.790 --> 03:12.120
And, yes, I am aware
I just said "lady parts."

03:12.120 --> 03:13.880
Okay,
I know you're not mad at me.

03:13.880 --> 03:16.710
No, I am mad at you.

03:18.710 --> 03:21.250
You made me care.

03:50.250 --> 03:53.830
Was this my fault?
Did I cause this?

03:53.830 --> 03:55.620
You told him
the subway vote was off.

03:55.620 --> 03:58.120
The next day he jumped.
What can I do?

03:58.120 --> 04:00.170
Well,
you can't save him,

04:00.170 --> 04:01.580
but you can still
save his family.

04:01.580 --> 04:04.420
Get the vote back
on the table.

04:17.750 --> 04:20.420
You're late.

04:20.420 --> 04:23.290
Woman: Technically,
I shouldn't be here at all.

04:24.920 --> 04:27.500
I did a head count.
5-4.

04:27.500 --> 04:28.920
We have the votes.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.210
That's what you said
the last time.

04:31.210 --> 04:34.790
The only swing vote
is Frank Jordano,

04:34.790 --> 04:36.790
and the folks who want to
put in the subway stop

04:36.790 --> 04:38.330
gave too much money
to his campaign

04:38.330 --> 04:40.830
for him to vote
any other way.

04:40.830 --> 04:43.290
You better hope
that's true.

04:43.290 --> 04:46.790
Jon's family's
depending on it.

04:56.790 --> 04:58.620
Okay, guys, listen up.

04:58.620 --> 05:02.670
Tonight, my son, Theo,
is gonna be joining us.

05:02.670 --> 05:05.330
What about --
And before you
say anything, Jared,

05:05.330 --> 05:07.710
I put up with Jasmine
and her vaping

05:07.710 --> 05:09.620
all the way up and down
New Hampshire.

05:09.620 --> 05:11.960
So you can put up with Theo
for one night.

05:11.960 --> 05:13.670
Fine.
Thank you.

05:13.670 --> 05:15.420
Okay, some rules.
You've got to be --

05:15.420 --> 05:17.500
There will be no swearing.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.710
There will be no smoking.
There will be no drugs.

05:19.710 --> 05:22.330
Medicinal or otherwise.

05:22.330 --> 05:25.040
Tonight, we are not
the Red Ferns.

05:25.040 --> 05:27.750
Tonight, we are The Wiggles.

05:27.750 --> 05:29.040
Theo: The Wiggles?

05:29.040 --> 05:31.580
-Hey. Bud.
-Hi, Dad.

05:31.580 --> 05:33.710
-Hi, guys.
-Good to see you. Missed you.

05:33.710 --> 05:36.210
You remember everybody, right?
-Crazy Keith!

05:39.380 --> 05:42.210
Hey.

05:42.210 --> 05:43.580
Either way,
I'm here for you.

05:43.580 --> 05:44.830
You know that.
"Either way"?

05:44.830 --> 05:46.250
You said it
was gonna be fine.

05:46.250 --> 05:48.670
Of course it's gonna be fine.
Well, then say that.

05:48.670 --> 05:50.170
Okay.

05:50.170 --> 05:52.040
Am I doing it again?

05:52.040 --> 05:54.080
A little bit.
Sorry.

05:54.080 --> 05:55.420
It's okay.

05:55.420 --> 05:56.790
Good morning, guys.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.790
Maggie, I have your results.

05:58.790 --> 06:01.210
Okay, um, there has been

06:01.210 --> 06:03.380
an eight percent reduction
in the tumor.

06:03.380 --> 06:04.920
So the chemo
seems to be effective.

06:04.920 --> 06:07.880
If we can get it to shrink by
at least another eight percent,

06:07.880 --> 06:10.880
then we can remove it without
affecting the healthy tissue.

06:10.880 --> 06:13.710
Oh, my God. Hot damn, huh?

06:13.710 --> 06:14.960
We're not
out of the woods yet.

06:14.960 --> 06:17.040
We need to continue the chemo

06:17.040 --> 06:19.710
so the tumor is small enough
that surgery is an option.

06:19.710 --> 06:21.540
Right. Okay. Okay.

06:21.540 --> 06:24.880
But as far as these screenings
go, this is encouraging.

06:26.210 --> 06:27.580
You're doing this thing
where you go up

06:27.580 --> 06:29.380
and then you come down,
and then you go up, and...

06:29.380 --> 06:30.540
Are we gonna end up?

06:30.540 --> 06:32.290
'Cause we would very much
like to end up.

06:32.290 --> 06:33.420
We're ending up.

06:35.080 --> 06:36.750
But we still
have a ways to go.

06:36.750 --> 06:37.920
Yeah, so you're --
you're not even aware

06:37.920 --> 06:39.120
that you're doing it.

06:39.120 --> 06:41.000
Excuse me one second.

06:44.080 --> 06:46.000
Well, this is good news.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.250
Don't say what
you're gonna say.

06:48.250 --> 06:50.250
You know what you need to do.
You need to call them.
No, I'm not gonna call them.

06:50.250 --> 06:51.420
Okay, you need to
call your parents.

06:51.420 --> 06:53.170
No, I'm not calling them
until after the surgery.

06:53.170 --> 06:54.920
What if I --
Neither can you.

06:54.920 --> 06:56.500
But what if, Sir --
And neither can anyone

06:56.500 --> 06:58.920
from the touring company
of "Hamilton."
But, Sir --

07:02.580 --> 07:06.170
Oh. Hey, you.
Hunter: Hey.

07:06.170 --> 07:08.250
So I checked with my friend
down at the bank.

07:08.250 --> 07:09.790
Even if Delilah
didn't know about it,

07:09.790 --> 07:12.420
everything Ashley did
was legal.

07:12.420 --> 07:14.580
If it was legal,
why'd she go off the grid?

07:14.580 --> 07:15.620
I don't know.

07:15.620 --> 07:17.460
Well, thanks for checking.
No problem.

07:17.460 --> 07:19.120
Let me know if there's
anything else I can do.

07:19.120 --> 07:22.000
Yeah, there is one thing.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.620
Do you want to have dinner?

07:25.620 --> 07:27.380
I like food.

07:27.380 --> 07:28.710
You name the place,
I'll make the reservation.

07:28.710 --> 07:32.620
How about my place?

07:32.620 --> 07:34.000
Sure.

07:35.210 --> 07:37.460
Oh, shoot. Carter's calling.
I gotta go.

07:37.460 --> 07:40.290
I'll see you at 8:00?

07:40.290 --> 07:43.290
It's a date.
Okay. Uh, yeah.

07:43.290 --> 07:45.290
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
What did I just do?

07:45.290 --> 07:47.040
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Please
tell me this clicked over.

07:47.040 --> 07:48.620
Carter? Carter?
You seem good.

07:48.620 --> 07:50.670
Carter, real quick.
Um, go into Friend Mode.

07:50.670 --> 07:53.120
I-I just invited Hunter
over to my place for dinner.

07:58.040 --> 07:59.460
Definitely want to spend
a lot of time on that --

07:59.460 --> 08:01.380
both before and after.

08:01.380 --> 08:02.420
Yeah, we will.

08:02.420 --> 08:04.330
Oh, my God.
What?

08:04.330 --> 08:06.710
I just got an e-mail.

08:06.710 --> 08:09.330
You were wondering why Jon
overpaid for the buildings?

08:10.880 --> 08:13.830
I just got the answer.

08:13.830 --> 08:15.500
I'll be right there.

08:19.920 --> 08:21.830
Everyone
we have news.

08:21.830 --> 08:22.830
You say it.
No, you say it.

08:22.830 --> 08:23.830
It's your news.

08:23.830 --> 08:24.920
Okay, I'll say it.

08:24.920 --> 08:28.920
The chemo has shrunk
the tumor.

08:28.920 --> 08:30.830
-Oh, yes.
-That's fantastic.

08:30.830 --> 08:32.500
-Wow.
-That is amazing.

08:32.500 --> 08:33.540
-This is incredible.
-Congratulations.

08:33.540 --> 08:34.540
Only by eight percent.

08:34.540 --> 08:36.500
Only?
Eight percent, you guys.

08:36.500 --> 08:39.920
When did I become the positive
one in this relationship?

08:39.920 --> 08:41.080
Congratulations.
That's amazing.

08:41.080 --> 08:42.540
Sophie:
Yeah, it really is.

08:42.540 --> 08:44.920
And, you know,
if we want to continue

08:44.920 --> 08:46.040
on this track of amazing,

08:46.040 --> 08:48.210
we could teach
a young woman to drive.

08:48.210 --> 08:49.880
That was
a very nice segue.

08:49.880 --> 08:52.040
Thank you.
Mom, can we do this?

08:52.040 --> 08:54.290
One second.

08:54.290 --> 08:55.880
-Saved by the bell.
-Where's Gina?

08:55.880 --> 08:57.750
She went to pick up
our wedding album.

08:57.750 --> 08:59.540
Wedding alb--
Haven't you guys been married

08:59.540 --> 09:01.380
for like four years?
And yet I feel like
I've been hearing about

09:01.380 --> 09:03.210
this album for 40 years.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.580
Negative Gary's back,
you guys.

09:04.580 --> 09:06.040
-Welcome back.
-Aw.

09:06.040 --> 09:07.380
Wasn't gone for long.
Yeah.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.750
So an offer?
I-I -- I don't understand.

09:09.750 --> 09:12.210
Apparently, when Jon
first bought the buildings,

09:12.210 --> 09:13.750
there were plans
for a subway stop to go in.

09:13.750 --> 09:17.420
And if it had, the properties
would have doubled in value.

09:17.420 --> 09:20.040
That's why he overpaid
for them.

09:20.040 --> 09:21.420
He would have
made a fortune.

09:21.420 --> 09:24.670
But now, the subway
is back on the table,

09:24.670 --> 09:27.420
and there's an investor who
believes the vote will pass.

09:27.420 --> 09:29.830
We got an e-mail saying
he's gonna make an offer.

09:29.830 --> 09:33.620
Well, that's great. Right?
We don't you sound more excited?

09:33.620 --> 09:36.250
Because the subway stop
is not a sure thing,

09:36.250 --> 09:38.620
so the offer won't be huge.

09:38.620 --> 09:41.500
Most likely,
you'll still be upside down.

09:41.500 --> 09:43.500
By how much?
I'm not sure.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.080
I want us to get on the phone
with their lawyer

09:45.080 --> 09:46.290
as soon as possible.

09:46.290 --> 09:47.920
We have to
move quickly because

09:47.920 --> 09:50.120
the subway vote
is tomorrow at 3:00,

09:50.120 --> 09:52.750
and if it doesn't pass,
they'll pull the offer.

09:52.750 --> 09:54.250
Okay.

09:54.250 --> 09:56.330
Let me, uh --
let me just tell Soph.

09:57.750 --> 09:59.080
Gary:
You need to make an album

09:59.080 --> 10:01.080
about the making
of your wedding album.

10:01.080 --> 10:03.500
Mom, are you ready?
Uh, sweetie,

10:03.500 --> 10:05.620
Katherine and I need to
do something right now.

10:05.620 --> 10:08.540
So --
You know what?
I'll teach you how to drive.

10:08.540 --> 10:10.170
And then I'll teach you
how to drive correctly.

10:11.620 --> 10:13.210
Okay,
where are the keys?

10:13.210 --> 10:14.710
Oh, you won't be
driving today.

10:14.710 --> 10:17.540
The key is this manual,

10:17.540 --> 10:20.540
and it unlocks the knowledge
you need to drive this car.

10:20.540 --> 10:22.330
You ready to sub out?
Yeah.

10:22.330 --> 10:25.170
Yeah.

10:25.170 --> 10:28.170
Listen up.
A lot of people,

10:28.170 --> 10:30.290
they're gonna try to teach you
how to drive correctly.

10:30.290 --> 10:32.170
Please let me be
one of those people.

10:32.170 --> 10:34.380
I'm gonna teach you how people
really drive.

10:34.380 --> 10:35.830
You're gonna hear
a lot of shouting

10:35.830 --> 10:38.460
about keeping your hands
at 10:00 and 2:00.

10:38.460 --> 10:40.210
That's a load of garbage.
It's really not.

10:40.210 --> 10:41.500
It --

10:41.500 --> 10:42.670
Oh, crap. It's Gina.
I knew I should have gone.

10:42.670 --> 10:44.290
Hey, babe.

10:44.290 --> 10:46.380
Regina: I am at the studio
with Berge.

10:46.380 --> 10:48.330
There is a problem
with the album.

10:48.330 --> 10:51.170
He wants to talk
to "the man."

10:51.170 --> 10:53.750
Oh, God.
So, here, Berge.

10:53.750 --> 10:55.170
Here's "the man."

10:55.170 --> 10:57.830
Berge,
did you really say that?

10:57.830 --> 10:59.210
Hello, Jerome.
Berge, what did you --

10:59.210 --> 11:01.920
How can I illuminate
the situation today

11:01.920 --> 11:04.920
with this woman,
who is so difficult --
Berge, listen to me.

11:04.920 --> 11:08.210
No, it is your ears that need to
listen to me, Rome, because --

11:08.210 --> 11:10.210
Berge, stop talking.

11:10.210 --> 11:12.330
I cannot --
I cannot stop talking

11:12.330 --> 11:14.500
because she bring
to my creative space...
You're only making it worse.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.040
...the pollution
of the emotions.

11:16.040 --> 11:17.670
Berge, stop.

11:17.670 --> 11:19.250
Are you looking
at the album?

11:19.250 --> 11:21.080
I'm looking at it.
It is so voluptuous.

11:21.080 --> 11:22.920
I'm sure it is.

11:22.920 --> 11:24.500
Open to the first page.
Tell me what you see.

11:24.500 --> 11:29.880
Okay. I see Miss Gina
in a very delicious dress.

11:29.880 --> 11:32.380
No, what you see is the picture
of the only person in the world

11:32.380 --> 11:35.210
that I am allowed
to have sex with.
Ooh.

11:35.210 --> 11:37.580
So whatever Gina wants to happen
is what's going to happen.

11:37.580 --> 11:39.790
If Gina says, "Give Berge
an extra hundred dollars,"

11:39.790 --> 11:41.210
you walk away with a Benjamin.

11:41.210 --> 11:42.960
If Gina says,
"Tell Berge to shove

11:42.960 --> 11:44.620
this entire album up his --"

11:44.620 --> 11:46.040
I don't even think
this would fit up there.

11:46.040 --> 11:47.460
Well, I'll tell you
what's not gonna happen.

11:47.460 --> 11:50.380
This fight is not gonna
leave your studio.

11:51.540 --> 11:53.250
Eyes on the road.

11:53.250 --> 11:55.210
Just give her a little gas.

11:56.880 --> 11:57.880
Whoa, easy!

11:57.880 --> 11:59.750
Whoa!
Less gas! Less gas!

11:59.750 --> 12:01.460
A lot. A lot less gas.

12:01.460 --> 12:03.040
Sorry.
Geez.

12:03.040 --> 12:06.210
Hey, Carter, just calling
to check if we got that offer.

12:06.210 --> 12:07.750
You know
I would tell you.

12:07.750 --> 12:10.420
So -- So the real reason
you're calling

12:10.420 --> 12:12.420
is you're worried
about your hot date.

12:12.420 --> 12:14.960
Look, it's just the only person
I've been with

12:14.960 --> 12:19.580
since Theo was born
cheated on me.

12:19.580 --> 12:23.080
How do I know
I'm what he wants?

12:23.080 --> 12:25.750
Lady,
you are a smoke show.

12:25.750 --> 12:28.580
You are testing the limits
of my sexual orientation.

12:28.580 --> 12:30.750
If you were not my boss
and a woman, I would --

12:30.750 --> 12:31.920
Carter.
What?

12:31.920 --> 12:34.580
You need to know
your market value,

12:34.580 --> 12:36.120
because you're going
on the market tonight.

12:36.120 --> 12:38.170
He's got muscles
and tattoos.

12:38.170 --> 12:40.080
How do you know
he has tattoos?

12:40.080 --> 12:43.580
I just know it.
I know it in my heart.

12:43.580 --> 12:46.750
Hey, I'm just saying, if you
got to jump out mid-lesson

12:46.750 --> 12:49.580
for road rage, you might not be
the best driving instructor.

12:49.580 --> 12:51.080
Is that you talking?
Or the manual?

12:52.670 --> 12:54.830
How was the lesson?

12:54.830 --> 12:56.290
Oh, well, that depends.

12:56.290 --> 12:58.120
Was I supposed to
learn how to drive

12:58.120 --> 13:01.330
or how to identify the,
and I quote, "po-po"

13:01.330 --> 13:02.540
from 50 feet away?

13:04.460 --> 13:07.620
I'll go ask some
follow-up questions.

13:10.040 --> 13:11.460
Well, that went well.

13:11.460 --> 13:13.380
At least everyone
walked away from it.

13:13.380 --> 13:14.380
Where's Rome?

13:14.380 --> 13:17.790
He went home.
But look who stopped by.

13:29.960 --> 13:33.120
Delilah, I know
you're upset, but...

13:33.120 --> 13:34.670
everything I did,
I did for Jon.

13:34.670 --> 13:37.540
What do you mean?
What did you do?

13:37.540 --> 13:40.000
You can't sell
those buildings.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.330
How do you know
about that?

13:41.330 --> 13:43.420
How about instead of us
asking her questions,

13:43.420 --> 13:46.330
you tell us exactly
what the hell is going on.

13:46.330 --> 13:49.750
Jon leveraged the entire
business against something

13:49.750 --> 13:51.580
he thought
was a sure thing.

13:51.580 --> 13:55.540
Kept moving money around,
borrowing from different deals.

13:55.540 --> 13:58.580
That's why he took out
the mortgage on the house.

13:58.580 --> 14:02.040
To buy time.
And it was working.

14:02.040 --> 14:04.000
We thought
that we convinced everyone

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
to put the subway vote
back on.

14:06.000 --> 14:10.170
But then the day
before he died...

14:10.170 --> 14:14.710
Come on, Jeri!
You said you had the votes!

14:14.710 --> 14:15.960
Ashley: ...he got word
that the subway stop

14:15.960 --> 14:17.380
wasn't gonna happen.

14:17.380 --> 14:21.460
He was in over his head
with no way out.

14:21.460 --> 14:23.880
You guys talk about
how you should have known.

14:23.880 --> 14:26.290
How you should have
seen the signs.

14:26.290 --> 14:27.460
Ashley: I'll just
call the lenders.

14:27.460 --> 14:28.710
I'll ask them
for another extension.

14:28.710 --> 14:32.880
They gave us at least --
No. No, Ashley. It's over.

14:32.880 --> 14:35.120
Ashley: I saw them.

14:35.120 --> 14:37.540
They were right there.
I just --

14:37.540 --> 14:39.620
I just didn't know
what they meant.

14:39.620 --> 14:41.880
That morning, he said

14:41.880 --> 14:43.960
he had to close
the restaurant deal that day.

14:43.960 --> 14:46.380
And then during the call,
he changed his clothes

14:46.380 --> 14:48.420
like he was going somewhere.

14:48.420 --> 14:50.620
But if he had been
going somewhere,

14:50.620 --> 14:54.790
then I would have
known about it.

14:54.790 --> 14:56.710
And then he...

14:56.710 --> 14:58.250
I got this.
Why don't you take a long lunch?

14:58.250 --> 15:00.080
Okay.
He sent me to an early lunch

15:00.080 --> 15:01.250
so that I wouldn't be
the one to find him.
Thanks, Ashley.

15:01.250 --> 15:02.920
Ashley Morales?

15:02.920 --> 15:04.670
Jon: If you could do
anything with your life...
Thank you.

15:04.670 --> 15:06.250
...what would you do?

15:06.250 --> 15:08.330
Ashley:
I'd go to Barcelona.

15:14.960 --> 15:15.750
But I was too late.

15:15.750 --> 15:18.120
No!!

15:18.120 --> 15:23.120
I was 12 seconds
too late.

15:29.620 --> 15:33.080
I think part of her doesn't
want me to get my license

15:33.080 --> 15:37.250
because she doesn't want to
lose me like she lost Dad.

15:37.250 --> 15:41.830
I get it, believe me.

15:41.830 --> 15:43.210
Ever since my brother died,

15:43.210 --> 15:46.620
my parents have been
crazy overprotective.

15:47.830 --> 15:49.620
At the end of the day,
you know,

15:49.620 --> 15:52.790
parents just want to know
that their kids are okay.

15:52.790 --> 15:56.120
I-I bet yours are so relieved
that the chemo's working.

15:57.330 --> 16:01.790
Actually,
I haven't told them.

16:01.790 --> 16:04.040
It's good news, right?

16:04.040 --> 16:06.460
I mean, you said
if it shrinks 10% more,

16:06.460 --> 16:08.620
then they can operate.

16:08.620 --> 16:10.000
No, I mean...

16:12.830 --> 16:18.290
I haven't told them
that my cancer is back.

16:18.290 --> 16:20.880
Ah, you didn't
want them to worry.

16:24.500 --> 16:27.710
Hey, how about I give you
a lesson tomorrow?

16:27.710 --> 16:30.330
Really? But I thought
you haven't driven

16:30.330 --> 16:31.920
since...your brother.

16:31.920 --> 16:34.420
Well, I'm not driving.
You are.

16:34.420 --> 16:37.670
And there's a pretty good chance
I beat this,

16:37.670 --> 16:40.170
so I'm actually gonna
need you to drive carefully.

16:40.170 --> 16:42.500
Yeah, let me see
what I can do.

16:44.500 --> 16:47.000
Why didn't you tell me
any of this?

16:47.000 --> 16:48.380
Because 11 weeks ago,

16:48.380 --> 16:50.380
I got them to put the vote
back on the table.

16:50.380 --> 16:51.830
How?

16:51.830 --> 16:53.710
Jon's connections.

16:53.710 --> 16:56.330
I thought if
I couldn't save him,

16:56.330 --> 16:57.500
maybe I could save
his legacy.

17:00.500 --> 17:02.790
So I used the money
from the life insurance

17:02.790 --> 17:04.920
to pay for the buildings
until the vote was back on.

17:04.920 --> 17:06.920
How?
The loan was in my name.

17:06.920 --> 17:08.710
The bank wouldn't let us
touch the money.

17:08.710 --> 17:13.210
Jon knew that would happen, so
he took out a-another policy.

17:13.210 --> 17:15.460
So why didn't the bank
freeze that money, too?

17:15.460 --> 17:17.420
'Cause he didn't leave
the money to you.

17:19.040 --> 17:20.880
He left it to the guys.

17:20.880 --> 17:24.880
He knew you would know
what to do with it.

17:24.880 --> 17:27.120
Rutledge.

17:27.120 --> 17:30.460
You were right, Gary.
He had a plan all along.

17:38.710 --> 17:40.380
What is that?

17:40.380 --> 17:42.580
I should have given this
to you sooner.

17:44.790 --> 17:46.670
He left it on the balcony.

17:49.120 --> 17:51.250
Oh, my God.

17:52.750 --> 17:54.750
Get out of my house.

17:54.750 --> 17:56.920
Delilah, those buildings are
gonna be worth a lot of money.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.170
You just have to hold on --

17:58.170 --> 18:00.750
Get out.
Get out of my house.

18:03.420 --> 18:05.620
Get out!

18:20.420 --> 18:23.170
Okay.
Find a mustache.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.790
Cannot be part
of a beard.

18:25.790 --> 18:29.460
Um...
that lady has one.

18:29.460 --> 18:30.670
Stop pointing. Stop pointing.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.120
Yeah. Yeah.
Moustache.

18:37.290 --> 18:40.460
So, how's school going?

18:40.460 --> 18:43.170
It's okay.

18:43.170 --> 18:46.460
Hmm?
What's happening?

18:46.460 --> 18:49.460
Well, Max told me
he doesn't want to be

18:49.460 --> 18:51.380
my best friend anymore.

18:51.380 --> 18:54.960
What?
But you are super cool.

18:54.960 --> 18:57.960
You have to say that.
You're my dad.

19:00.500 --> 19:03.620
Well, you are not gonna
believe this, but Jared,

19:03.620 --> 19:06.880
he said the exact
same thing to me.

19:06.880 --> 19:09.750
It made me feel terrible.

19:09.750 --> 19:13.580
So how did what Max say
to you make you feel?

19:13.580 --> 19:17.000
Not great.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.670
Yeah.
That is how I felt.

19:22.500 --> 19:24.170
You know what, Dad?
Hmm?

19:24.170 --> 19:25.880
If Jared doesn't want to
be your best friend,

19:25.880 --> 19:28.830
maybe I could be
Jared's best friend.

19:30.500 --> 19:33.500
Hmm.

19:34.830 --> 19:36.210
Okay.

19:36.210 --> 19:37.670
Leather vest.

19:37.670 --> 19:39.330
Leather vest?

19:39.330 --> 19:41.580
That would have been me
in the '90s, bud.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.920
Mmm. Smells good.

19:45.920 --> 19:47.580
It's chicken.

19:47.580 --> 19:49.750
I've never
had chicken before.

19:49.750 --> 19:51.120
Does it taste
like chicken?

19:51.120 --> 19:53.420
Shall I pour some wine?

19:53.420 --> 19:55.880
Yes, please.
Let's definitely have some wine.

on the Waverly Steel case?

20:05.920 --> 20:08.920
Let's not talk about work.

Yeah. You're right.

20:16.750 --> 20:18.210
Yeah.
Yeah.

20:18.210 --> 20:20.750
I'm glad we talked
about stuff.

20:20.750 --> 20:23.380
And you know you can
always talk to me or Mom

20:23.380 --> 20:25.540
about anything
that's bothering you, right?

20:25.540 --> 20:27.380
Yeah.

20:29.290 --> 20:32.250
What?

20:32.250 --> 20:35.830
I just didn't
want to bother you.

20:35.830 --> 20:37.750
You guys have
enough problems.

20:40.330 --> 20:43.580
Well, we do have a lot
going on right now, pal.

20:43.580 --> 20:47.920
But there is nothing more
important than you.

20:47.920 --> 20:49.290
Okay?

20:49.290 --> 20:50.580
Okay.

20:50.580 --> 20:53.080
Good night, pal.
Lights out.

20:53.080 --> 20:54.920
Good night.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.290
Open or closed?

20:56.290 --> 20:59.750
Closed.
Closed.

20:59.750 --> 21:03.000
Love you, pal.
Love you.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.750
Hey, that --
that kid's great.

21:12.330 --> 21:17.330
Listen, my parents
got divorced,

21:17.330 --> 21:20.330
and I can tell you,
as much as --

21:20.330 --> 21:24.500
as you and Katherine
are in limbo, Theo is, too.

21:24.500 --> 21:26.540
You should talk to her.

21:26.540 --> 21:28.710
Find out
where her head's at.

21:30.960 --> 21:32.710
You're right, man.

21:32.710 --> 21:34.960
Thanks.

21:39.330 --> 21:40.960
Thanks for cooking.

21:40.960 --> 21:43.290
Thanks for
helping clean up.

21:43.290 --> 21:45.000
Yeah,
we're quite a team.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.460
Hmm. Yeah.

21:46.460 --> 21:50.210
♪ You know a poor man
needs money ♪

21:50.210 --> 21:51.210
♪ Yes, he does ♪
Yeah.

21:51.210 --> 21:54.380
♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ♪

21:54.380 --> 21:56.000

need some rain to grow ♪

21:56.000 --> 21:58.380
I'm sorry.

21:58.380 --> 22:02.670
Um, I haven't been with one --
someone --

22:02.670 --> 22:07.250
Look, if you're not sure
about this, let's wait.

22:07.250 --> 22:08.250
♪ Baby, I need you ♪

22:08.250 --> 22:09.830
Okay.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.250
Gary: You can't just
keep reading it, D.

22:24.250 --> 22:25.830
I have to.

22:25.830 --> 22:29.830
I was so angry at him
for not saying goodbye,

22:29.830 --> 22:32.210
this whole time wondering
how he could leave us --

22:32.210 --> 22:34.380
leave Sophie and Danny
without so much as a note.

22:34.380 --> 22:36.210
And now I'm holding it,

22:36.210 --> 22:40.380
and it just
doesn't make any sense.

22:40.380 --> 22:43.210
He was in so much pain.

22:43.210 --> 22:47.420
For things that
he won't even say.

22:47.420 --> 22:50.710
He couldn't -- he couldn't
talk to me about them.

22:50.710 --> 22:52.460
Didn't talk to anybody.

22:56.250 --> 22:59.460
He was deeply troubled,
D.

22:59.460 --> 23:02.080
In ways that we didn't
even realize.

23:02.080 --> 23:05.920
He loved you.
I know that.

23:07.580 --> 23:09.420
Even in his darkest hour,

23:09.420 --> 23:12.380
he was always
trying to take care of you.

23:12.380 --> 23:13.710
That's what this is.

23:13.710 --> 23:16.540
This trust.

23:16.540 --> 23:20.330
I mean, this --
this is Rutledge.

23:20.330 --> 23:22.290
He left me and the guys
all that money 'cause he knew

23:22.290 --> 23:25.000
that we would use it
to take care...

23:26.960 --> 23:30.000
You know somebody
named Barbara Morgan?

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
Ashley asked me
about her.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.580
Yeah, she asked me
about her, too.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.080
Who is she?
I don't know.

23:36.080 --> 23:38.670
But Jon must have,

23:38.670 --> 23:42.080
'cause he made her
the fourth beneficiary.

23:43.500 --> 23:47.080
Later today,
there's a vote,

23:47.080 --> 23:48.920
and it could save
your family.

23:48.920 --> 23:52.580
So I think
we got to be there.

23:52.580 --> 23:55.920
Yeah.

24:01.460 --> 24:03.960
Mmm.

24:03.960 --> 24:06.500
So, you, uh,
saving this for later?

24:15.790 --> 24:17.620
Hey, so, there is something
I want to tell you.

24:17.620 --> 24:19.880
Henry offered me partner.

24:19.880 --> 24:23.460
What?

24:23.460 --> 24:25.670
When?
Yesterday.

24:25.670 --> 24:27.790
That's what we were talking
about at the office.

24:27.790 --> 24:29.380
Are you gonna take it?

24:29.380 --> 24:32.620
Yeah, I think I will.
I mean, I have.

24:32.620 --> 24:37.620
And you're
just telling me now?

24:37.620 --> 24:39.380
I mean, last night
was just so nice.

24:39.380 --> 24:41.080
I didn't want to
wreck the mood.

24:41.080 --> 24:44.880
You mean you just didn't
want to wreck us having sex.

24:44.880 --> 24:47.500
Well, no.
Yes.

24:47.500 --> 24:50.670
Are you mad at me
because I made partner?

24:50.670 --> 24:52.330
No.

24:52.330 --> 24:56.330
I'm mad at the way
you told me you made partner.

24:56.330 --> 24:58.750
I think
you should leave.

24:58.750 --> 25:00.250
Really?

25:00.250 --> 25:01.710
Really.

25:01.710 --> 25:03.080
Okay, Katie --

25:03.080 --> 25:06.330
Uh, please.

25:06.330 --> 25:08.710
Sure. Yeah.
Um, I'll just take care of --

25:08.710 --> 25:10.710
Uh, just leave them.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.080
Please go.

25:22.250 --> 25:24.880
Delilah: So, I hear you finally
got your wedding album.

25:24.880 --> 25:27.620
Yep.
Thanks to this guy.

25:29.210 --> 25:30.960
There was a problem, but I spoke
to Berge and handled it.

25:30.960 --> 25:33.620
Yeah, you did. Mmm.

25:33.620 --> 25:35.540
What was the problem?

25:35.540 --> 25:37.120
I have no idea.

25:37.120 --> 25:40.120
What?
But you spoke to him.

25:40.120 --> 25:41.920
Yeah, but I didn't
let him get a word in.

25:41.920 --> 25:43.540
Because I had your back.

25:44.710 --> 25:46.210
Where's my kiss?

25:46.210 --> 25:48.040
I don't want you
to just have my back.

25:48.040 --> 25:49.420
I want you to agree with me
because you heard my side

25:49.420 --> 25:53.880
and you agree with the merits
of my argument.

25:53.880 --> 25:56.880
If only you had
a marriage manual.

25:56.880 --> 25:59.040
Babe.

25:59.040 --> 26:00.880
Oh, I'm sorry.
This seat is taken.

26:00.880 --> 26:01.920
Katherine: Delilah.

26:01.920 --> 26:03.710
Hey.

26:03.710 --> 26:06.750
The vote's in 20 minutes.
Mm-hmm.

26:06.750 --> 26:08.460
Despite what Ashley says,

26:08.460 --> 26:12.420
the only sure thing you have
right now is this offer.

26:12.420 --> 26:15.420
So if you want to take it,
we have to do it now.

26:18.790 --> 26:21.580
I need a minute.

26:43.080 --> 26:46.120
Are you Delilah Dixon?

26:46.120 --> 26:49.380
I'm sorry,
do I know you?

26:49.380 --> 26:52.620
No.

26:52.620 --> 26:54.880
But I knew your husband.

27:00.120 --> 27:01.790
My name
is Jeri Huntington,

27:01.790 --> 27:03.960
and I'm a Councilwoman
here in Cambridge.

27:05.830 --> 27:09.620
I called Jon
the day before...

27:12.040 --> 27:16.790
I was the one who told him
we couldn't get the votes.

27:18.460 --> 27:21.120
I'm so sorry.

27:22.460 --> 27:25.460
You can't do
what you're doing.

27:29.710 --> 27:34.080
I've been doing the same thing
since it happened.

27:34.080 --> 27:36.080
You can't
blame yourself.

27:44.380 --> 27:48.420
You shouldn't know this,
but...you have the votes.

27:49.710 --> 27:52.500
The subway stop
is happening.

27:52.500 --> 27:54.500
Don't sell
those buildings.

28:06.880 --> 28:10.120
Nice. Real nice.

28:10.120 --> 28:12.540
You're so much more chill
than the boys.

28:12.540 --> 28:15.380
You're just now realizing this?

28:22.960 --> 28:26.210
My parents.
I'll call them back later.

28:26.210 --> 28:27.880
You know, if my mom
were designing this car,

28:27.880 --> 28:30.080
there would be
a hand brake right here

28:30.080 --> 28:31.460
in front of
the glove compartment,

28:31.460 --> 28:33.880
and all she'd have to do is say,
"Look out, look out!"

28:33.880 --> 28:35.580
And it would engage.

28:35.580 --> 28:38.710
Well, you know, if it was my mom
designing this car,

28:38.710 --> 28:41.580
the doors would only unlock
to let me out for college.

28:42.790 --> 28:44.710
She just
wants to protect you.

28:44.710 --> 28:47.540
Sort of like your folks?

28:47.540 --> 28:50.380
Watch it
or I will tell your mom

28:50.380 --> 28:51.830
that she should go
to college with you.

28:51.830 --> 28:53.250
Hey.

28:53.250 --> 28:54.500
Katherine:
Are you sure?

28:54.500 --> 28:57.170
Yes, I'm sure.

28:57.170 --> 28:59.460
Okay.
I'll let them know.

29:07.960 --> 29:09.750
Maggie: Uh,
you're cutting too far.

29:09.750 --> 29:11.580
Cutting too far.
Ooh.

29:11.580 --> 29:14.420
You know, it's not actually
called perpendicular parking.

29:14.420 --> 29:16.420
Ooh. Hoo-hoo.

29:16.420 --> 29:18.620
God, I can't do this.

29:18.620 --> 29:21.420
My dad was supposed to
teach me how to drive.

29:21.420 --> 29:25.580
S-Supposed to teach me
how to do all of this.

29:28.080 --> 29:29.290
Put it in park.

29:38.330 --> 29:40.170
Scooch over.

29:40.170 --> 29:41.380
Wait. But I thought
you didn't drive.

29:41.380 --> 29:43.620
Quick,
before I change my mind.

29:43.620 --> 29:45.380
Madam Secretary: That's four
votes against the subway,

29:45.380 --> 29:47.210
three votes for the subway.

29:47.210 --> 29:49.460
Councilwoman Huntington,
how do you vote?

29:49.460 --> 29:51.960
I vote in favor
of the subway.

29:51.960 --> 29:55.380
Okay.

29:55.380 --> 29:59.120
The record will show
we are now tied, 4-4.

29:59.120 --> 30:01.330
Councilman Jordano,
it's gonna come down to you.

30:03.670 --> 30:05.540
How do you vote, Frank?

30:07.790 --> 30:11.620
Well
after much debate

30:11.620 --> 30:13.830
and hearing people talk today,

30:13.830 --> 30:17.170
both sides, uh,
make an excellent argument.

30:17.170 --> 30:20.170
But ultimately, when it comes
to whether or not to put in

30:20.170 --> 30:21.000
the Griffin Street stop...

30:26.210 --> 30:28.420
...my vote is no.

30:29.750 --> 30:32.330
Madam Secretary: Order! Order!

30:32.330 --> 30:34.000
The motion
for the Griffin Street

30:34.000 --> 30:35.170
subway stop is denied.

30:35.170 --> 30:36.750
This matter is hereby closed.

30:41.040 --> 30:44.540
Oh, God.

30:44.540 --> 30:47.040
It's okay.

30:48.830 --> 30:51.540
I sold the buildings.

30:51.540 --> 30:54.210
You did what?

30:54.210 --> 30:56.460
I sold the buildings.

30:56.460 --> 30:57.920
How did you know?

30:57.920 --> 31:00.210
I didn't. I just --

31:00.210 --> 31:02.540
I knew I had to take care
of my family.

31:02.540 --> 31:05.880
And I realized I needed
to trust my instincts,

31:05.880 --> 31:07.710
so that's what I did.

31:07.710 --> 31:08.580
Thank you.

31:10.120 --> 31:12.880
Maggie:
Line up your back bumpers.

31:12.880 --> 31:15.250
When your middle post

31:15.250 --> 31:17.960
passes their back bumper,
you cut right.

31:17.960 --> 31:22.620
And as your nose passes
the bumper, you cut left.

31:22.620 --> 31:25.210
And you drop right in.

31:25.210 --> 31:26.880
Yeah.

31:31.380 --> 31:32.540
What?
I said I didn't drive.

31:32.540 --> 31:34.540
I didn't say
I was a bad driver.

31:34.540 --> 31:35.790
Your turn.

31:37.420 --> 31:41.290
Welcome back! So?!
It was awesome, Mom!

31:41.290 --> 31:43.250
We should really think
about living on a bus.

31:43.250 --> 31:45.580
Huh. Well,
I'll tell you what,

31:45.580 --> 31:46.960
you make me
a pros and cons list,

31:46.960 --> 31:48.500
and I'll make you
a snack, okay?

31:48.500 --> 31:49.920
Okay.

31:49.920 --> 31:51.920
Something with kale.

31:51.920 --> 31:54.120
Jared got me into it.

31:54.120 --> 31:56.290
He's eating it,
not smoking it, right?

31:56.290 --> 31:57.460
Eddie:

31:57.460 --> 31:59.670
Sounds like you guys
had a great time.

31:59.670 --> 32:01.290
It was amazing.

32:01.290 --> 32:03.080
It was just what
we both needed.

32:03.080 --> 32:05.500
So, how was your night?

32:05.500 --> 32:08.920
Uh, not the rock-star life
Theo's accustomed to.

32:16.580 --> 32:19.620
Uh, yeah, yeah.
That's, uh...

32:19.620 --> 32:23.960
Well, we all can't
be rock stars.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.500
He'd be really proud
of you right now.

32:44.290 --> 32:45.710
You know what?

32:45.710 --> 32:47.710
I think the hardest part
about losing him

32:47.710 --> 32:51.710
was finding out all the secrets
he was keeping from us.

32:51.710 --> 32:54.210
Well, he only kept them 'cause
he didn't want to hurt you.

32:54.210 --> 32:56.620
Yeah.

32:56.620 --> 32:59.670
B-But, honestly, I just think
that made it worse.

33:06.210 --> 33:07.670
What are you doing?

33:07.670 --> 33:09.000
You need to call them...

33:10.500 --> 33:13.670
...and tell them
what's going on.

33:24.540 --> 33:26.380

heard your side.

36:23.330 --> 36:25.920
I got upset with you for
supporting me unconditionally,

36:25.920 --> 36:30.710
and I think I was upset because
I was annoyed at myself

36:30.710 --> 36:33.210
for supporting you
unconditionally.

36:33.210 --> 36:35.040
What do you mean?

36:35.040 --> 36:37.620
I don't think you should be
off your antidepressants.

36:38.960 --> 36:43.540
And I know that you keep
saying you're fine,

36:43.540 --> 36:46.460
and maybe right now
you are, but --

36:46.460 --> 36:49.040
but since you've gone off them,
I haven't been okay.

36:50.960 --> 36:54.540
You're not taking
the pills just for you.

36:54.540 --> 36:56.960

for both of us.

37:47.250 --> 37:48.920
Hey.
Ashley:
I'm so sorry.

37:48.920 --> 37:50.830
Where are you?
I should have been
honest with you.

37:50.830 --> 37:52.580
I-I wanted to
tell you everything

37:52.580 --> 37:54.460
at that bar that night.

37:54.460 --> 37:56.170
But  I just didn't
know if you'd understand.

37:56.170 --> 37:59.170
Did you find
Barbara Morgan?

37:59.170 --> 38:00.830
No. No.

38:00.830 --> 38:02.960
There -- There are things about
Jon that you'll never know.

38:02.960 --> 38:04.290
Oh, yeah? Like what?
What things?

38:04.290 --> 38:05.960
Things I don't even know.

38:05.960 --> 38:09.500
Gary, I-I should have told you.

38:09.500 --> 38:11.960
Those -- That building,
all those buildings...

38:11.960 --> 38:13.290
it wasn't just a business deal.

38:13.290 --> 38:15.330
What do you mean?
What were they?

38:15.330 --> 38:17.120
I just wanted to
say goodbye, Gary.

38:17.120 --> 38:18.500
What do you mean,
goodbye?

38:18.500 --> 38:20.710
Tell Delilah I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

38:20.710 --> 38:21.880
No, Ashley,
don't hang up. I...

38:40.170 --> 38:41.710
Who are you calling?
Katherine. Hey.

38:41.710 --> 38:44.920
Those mortgage bills
that went to the wrong place.

38:44.920 --> 38:46.170
Do you have that address?

38:46.170 --> 38:48.170
Yeah, I'll have Carter
send it over.

38:50.670 --> 38:53.210
Uh,
what were you saying?

38:56.170 --> 39:00.170
I was just saying
that I think...

39:00.170 --> 39:03.500
that we've been
holding on for Theo.

39:03.500 --> 39:08.330
And maybe that's not
the best thing for him.

39:08.330 --> 39:14.500
Uh, maybe...
the best thing

39:14.500 --> 39:16.920
is for both of us
just to move on.

39:21.710 --> 39:26.120
I-I think we should
get a divorce.

39:27.880 --> 39:30.710
Okay.

39:30.710 --> 39:33.620
Theo: Who's ready to see
my pros and cons list?

39:33.620 --> 39:35.460
I'm coming!

40:03.580 --> 40:05.580
Who lives here?

40:05.580 --> 40:07.170
I have no idea.

40:14.670 --> 40:16.670
Uh, are you looking
for Jonny?

40:16.670 --> 40:20.920
I think he's on vacation.
He hasn't been here for weeks.

40:20.920 --> 40:24.120
Uh, uh, Jonny asked us
to water his plants.

40:24.120 --> 40:26.080
You wouldn't happen to have
a spare key, would you?

40:26.080 --> 40:29.750
Because we --
we forgot ours.

40:29.750 --> 40:32.080
Sure.

40:52.120 --> 40:53.710
There's a camera.

40:53.710 --> 40:56.710
Do you think
he left a message?

40:56.710 --> 41:00.500
If he did, it isn't here.
There's no memory card.

41:09.620 --> 41:12.120
I'm guessing those photos
are not of us.

41:12.120 --> 41:13.290
I don't know
any of these people.

41:13.290 --> 41:16.170
This is before I met him.

41:16.170 --> 41:19.170
Oh, my God.

41:19.170 --> 41:22.330
What?

41:22.330 --> 41:25.210
What?

41:25.210 --> 41:27.670
It's the view
from the painting.

41:27.670 --> 41:29.500
Jon: You're not staring
at a blank wall anymore.

41:29.500 --> 41:31.210
It's the Cambridge side
of the Charles,

41:31.210 --> 41:32.380
so you can pretend you went
to Harvard with me.

41:32.380 --> 41:34.210
Boom.

41:34.210 --> 41:35.750
How's that for a view?

41:35.750 --> 41:38.380
He said it was the view
from when he was at Harvard.

41:38.380 --> 41:41.170
Do you think it was
his college apartment?

41:41.170 --> 41:43.380
I mean, is that why
he bought the building?

41:43.380 --> 41:45.920
Who painted this?
Jon -- Jon didn't paint.

41:51.500 --> 41:53.830
B. Morgan.

41:55.500 --> 41:57.670
Barbara Morgan.
