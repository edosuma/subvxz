WEBVTT

00:00.710 --> 00:02.520
Previously on rescue me...

00:02.540 --> 00:03.250
What, you want to fight?

00:03.280 --> 00:04.660
Yeah, I'm ready to
fight, lou. Let's do it.

00:06.200 --> 00:07.620
This guy's not ready.

00:07.660 --> 00:09.650
Reality dude.

00:09.670 --> 00:11.020
You gotta be in the band, bro.

00:11.040 --> 00:12.290
Count me in, bro.

00:12.310 --> 00:14.310
We should continue having sex.

00:14.330 --> 00:17.950
You're saying that you want to have
sex with me with no strings attached.

00:17.980 --> 00:18.560
Yeah.

00:18.590 --> 00:20.000
You don't have to worry
about teddy anymore.

00:20.030 --> 00:21.830
You know how he was banged
up after your father died?

00:21.860 --> 00:22.450
Right.

00:22.480 --> 00:25.630
He's running around volunteering at
every single V.A.Hospital there is.

00:25.660 --> 00:28.460
Kill me.I'll give you 3 grand.

00:28.490 --> 00:32.689
Look, I'm here to offer support and
let you guys know you're not forgotten.

00:32.710 --> 00:34.430
How about for 20 grand?

00:34.440 --> 00:36.740
Apparently your sister
maggie is down there with him.

00:36.770 --> 00:38.310
And she's into it 100%.

00:38.340 --> 00:42.810
They got in so much trouble.
Mr. Wills, are you masturbating?

00:42.830 --> 00:45.280
Somebody should call arlington national,
tell them there's going to be a rush.

00:45.300 --> 00:46.620
No, it's about time you're interested.

00:46.650 --> 00:48.520
Ok, could you put mom on, please?

00:48.540 --> 00:50.310
To what do I owe the pleasure?

00:50.330 --> 00:51.860
Hey, is terrence still on?

00:51.890 --> 00:54.240
No, he's in the other room
working on his crossword.

00:54.260 --> 00:56.730
He's so smart, your brother.
He's a really bright boy.

00:56.760 --> 01:00.060
- I got cancer.
- Oh, seany, my poor baby.

01:00.090 --> 01:02.290
I'm gonna need you to come to
new york, ma, and be with me.

01:02.310 --> 01:03.680
All right?I'm all alone on this one.

01:03.710 --> 01:05.209
I haven't even told the
guys in the firehouse.

01:05.230 --> 01:07.110
You're totally safe here.

01:07.130 --> 01:10.900
And you can drink, and
I'll keep your secrets.

01:10.920 --> 01:12.610
And you keep my son safe.

01:12.630 --> 01:14.580
Are you sleeping with
anybody else right now?

01:14.600 --> 01:17.790
- No.Only-- -
Janet.You are.

01:17.820 --> 01:19.570
That's perfect. It's
perfect.Keep doing it.

01:19.590 --> 01:21.600
This will be more like...

01:21.620 --> 01:22.720
an oasis.

01:22.730 --> 01:24.450
Tommy?

01:24.470 --> 01:25.820
What are you, drinking?

01:25.850 --> 01:27.120
No,
no, no--

01:27.150 --> 01:30.080
You got no right to tell
me what to do, got it?

01:30.110 --> 01:32.000
Boy, you got some balls, kid.

01:34.700 --> 01:37.450
Keep drinkin', pal.

01:37.470 --> 01:38.110
Shit.

01:40.620 --> 01:42.690
All right, all right. Hey.

01:42.710 --> 01:44.130
What's up?

01:44.150 --> 01:45.530
We got lots of damage
to the upper floors.

01:45.550 --> 01:47.270
A couple of residents unaccounted for.

01:47.290 --> 01:50.000
You and mike, you want to do
a quick sweep of the basement?

01:50.030 --> 01:51.020
- No.
- No.

01:51.040 --> 01:53.190
Yes.Go out that
door.Cross the courtyard--

01:53.210 --> 01:55.370
Yeah, yeah, I remember, I got it.Yeah.

02:00.870 --> 02:03.110
We had a fire here when I
first got into the department.

02:03.130 --> 02:06.030
Oh, yeah? Probably
started by a dinosaur.

02:08.190 --> 02:09.850
Me and jimmy got
assigned to the basement.

02:09.870 --> 02:12.590
I think the set-up in these
apartments might be different,

02:12.610 --> 02:14.780
but down there should
be just about the same.

02:14.810 --> 02:16.790
Yeah, was that during the
kennedy administration?

02:16.810 --> 02:19.090
- Ha, that's so funny.
- Sorry.

02:19.780 --> 02:21.640
Were the beatles broken up yet?

02:21.660 --> 02:23.420
You know what, speaking of bands,

02:23.440 --> 02:25.720
I don't want damian playing
in your little shitty one, ok?

02:25.740 --> 02:28.270
I want him focused on everything
he's gotta do at the academy.

02:28.300 --> 02:29.670
We're not a shitty band, tommy.

02:29.700 --> 02:32.150
We're actually pretty good, and
damian rips it up on the guitar.

02:32.170 --> 02:33.910
He's got some really
good chops, actually.

02:33.940 --> 02:37.040
I don't care if he has a jimi hendrix
tribute solo that he can pull out of his ass.

02:37.060 --> 02:39.760
I want him focused on the
work at hand, ok?Nothing else.

02:39.790 --> 02:42.470
Well, why don't you come and tell
him that yourself, face-to-face,

02:42.490 --> 02:44.490
when he's got his axe
strapped on his back, you know?

02:44.520 --> 02:47.410
We're actually rehearsing at the bar
tonight because it's an off night.

02:47.420 --> 02:48.690
Oh, wait, you know what, I forgot.

02:48.710 --> 02:49.810
You probably already know that

02:49.840 --> 02:52.130
because you've been doing your
secret little drinking thing there.

02:52.160 --> 02:54.310
Do me a favor, try to stay sober
long enough so you can hear us.

02:54.340 --> 02:56.480
Hey, you know what, that
was--I was tired that night.

02:56.500 --> 02:57.240
That was what that was about.

02:57.270 --> 02:59.440
Yeah, whatever, I didn't say
anything, asshole, all right?

02:59.470 --> 03:01.650
I kept your dirty little
secret for 3 reasons--

03:01.680 --> 03:04.740
one, I was embarrassed.Really
embarrassed.Ashamed actually.

03:04.770 --> 03:07.450
And two, you know, damian's got enough
on his plate without having to worry about

03:07.480 --> 03:09.980
whether his drunken uncle
is gonna show up shitfaced

03:10.010 --> 03:13.250
or clear-eyed holding a cup of
coffee in his very steady hand.

03:14.140 --> 03:16.930
- What was the third thing?
- What?

03:16.960 --> 03:19.000
You said there was 3 things.

03:20.410 --> 03:21.720
Did I mention shame?

03:21.750 --> 03:25.390
Yeah, you said I--you said you were
ashamed after the really embarrassed thing.

03:25.410 --> 03:27.380
Really embarrassed,
that was the third thing.

03:27.400 --> 03:29.950
- That was the third thing?
- Yes!Why?

03:29.970 --> 03:32.200
Because most people would
include the really embarrassed

03:32.220 --> 03:34.320
in with the just regular embarrassed.
It would all be one thing.

03:34.350 --> 03:36.730
And then shame would be its own,
separate whole individual thing.

03:36.760 --> 03:40.620
Right.Yeah, I should have
made shame its own, like, area.

03:40.650 --> 03:41.850
Because you know what? I was ashamed.

03:41.880 --> 03:44.150
- You really should be too, tom.
- Now it's an area?

03:44.180 --> 03:45.520
I thought it was with the thing.

03:45.530 --> 03:47.610
Hey, I can quit the booze
whenever I want, ok, asshole?

03:47.630 --> 03:49.420
Then you should. Quit
while you're ahead, tom.

03:49.450 --> 03:51.260
I don't feel like it, all right?

03:51.280 --> 03:53.230
Holy shit.

03:54.720 --> 03:56.020
You know what...

03:56.050 --> 03:58.710
check the other side
of the room, all right?

04:00.450 --> 04:02.410
Hey, lou, you might want
to run a ride down here.

04:02.440 --> 04:04.930
I got smoke with no bitch, all right?

04:04.950 --> 04:06.270
Copy.

04:06.300 --> 04:09.250
Yeah, I can quit the sauce
whenever I want to, pancho.

04:09.270 --> 04:11.420
- Oh, yeah?
- Yep.

04:11.450 --> 04:14.360
What about all that A.A.
Bullshit then, tom, you know?

04:14.380 --> 04:16.089
About it being a disease and everything.

04:16.110 --> 04:17.459
Yeah, well, some people it is.

04:17.480 --> 04:20.180
It's like bone cancer,
you know? Kills 'em dead.

04:20.209 --> 04:21.700
Me, it was like the flu.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.940
I had it and now I'm over it, you know?

04:26.170 --> 04:28.740
- Let me ask you something, tom.
- What?

04:28.760 --> 04:31.180
How much have you had to drink today?

04:32.960 --> 04:35.480
Why don't you take a swing at
me and we'll find out, asshole.

04:37.000 --> 04:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here

04:47.970 --> 04:49.530
Lou, what the hell was that?

04:49.550 --> 04:50.890
Are you guys ok?

04:50.910 --> 04:52.530
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we're fine.

04:52.550 --> 04:53.960
Floor gave way on the third story.

04:53.980 --> 04:55.970
A guy had a goddamn safe up there.

04:55.990 --> 04:57.240
What kind of safe?

04:57.250 --> 04:58.540
Not your ordinary home safe.

04:58.570 --> 05:01.420
An 8,000 pound goddamn bank safe.

05:01.440 --> 05:03.590
Oh, shit, tom, the door's jammed.

05:03.620 --> 05:07.060
Hey, lou, any chance you guys coming down
here, maybe clearing the doorway for us?

05:07.080 --> 05:09.070
Copy. Be right there.

05:12.850 --> 05:14.030
All right, enough.

05:14.050 --> 05:16.160
What are we gonna do?

05:16.190 --> 05:18.170
Play scrabble.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.540
Shit.

05:21.270 --> 05:23.180
Where is that coming from?

05:25.370 --> 05:26.340
Wow.

05:30.640 --> 05:33.490
Hey, hey! Hey.

05:33.520 --> 05:35.260
Relax.

05:44.370 --> 05:46.400
Hey, relax, will you?

05:49.440 --> 05:51.420
What are you doing?

05:51.440 --> 05:54.680
I forgot to fill the tanks
from the last job, tom.

05:58.050 --> 06:00.130
You're shittin' me, right?

06:01.540 --> 06:04.190
That's awesome.

06:04.220 --> 06:05.980
Tom.

06:06.000 --> 06:06.970
Yeah?

06:06.990 --> 06:09.360
We got problems, or
should I say problem.

06:09.390 --> 06:12.990
The safe, it's down at the bottom of
the stairs up against the basement door.

06:13.020 --> 06:16.410
Trying to think of a way to get the
hell out of there, coming up dry.You?

06:16.440 --> 06:19.810
Uh, let me think. Um...

06:19.840 --> 06:22.010
nope. I've got nothing.

06:22.040 --> 06:23.610
How's your air?

06:25.020 --> 06:29.820
Uh, douchebag forgot to switch
the tanks out after the last call.

06:29.850 --> 06:34.700
So he's done, and I'm
probably really goddamn low.

06:34.730 --> 06:36.490
Shit.

06:37.280 --> 06:41.250
You all right? Just
relax, ok?Take it easy.

06:41.280 --> 06:42.420
- All right?
- What are we gonna do, tom?

06:42.450 --> 06:44.410
Just relax.

06:45.710 --> 06:47.600
Lou.

06:49.050 --> 06:53.470
I'm spitballing here.But that time jimmy
and I were in this building, I think...

06:53.490 --> 06:57.340
I think if you go up a floor,

06:57.360 --> 07:00.020
the second apartment in the back.

07:00.030 --> 07:03.280
Go into the apartment, go
through the living room,

07:03.310 --> 07:09.110
and, uh, the center of the living room
floor should be just above where we are, ok?

07:09.140 --> 07:11.510
You'll be there when we are?

07:11.530 --> 07:14.300
Yeah. Dead or alive.

07:14.320 --> 07:16.790
- Give us 2 minutes.
- All right.

07:20.460 --> 07:23.200
Lou, if you could shave about a minute
and a half off that, it would really help.

07:23.220 --> 07:23.860
Copy that.

07:23.880 --> 07:27.530
Oh, shit! Oh, shit.Holy shit.

07:30.820 --> 07:32.270
All right, kid, hang on.

07:32.290 --> 07:33.580
What do we do, tom?

07:33.610 --> 07:34.720
I really think we
ought to knock it down.

07:34.750 --> 07:36.330
Hey, hey, hey.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.070
- Tom!
- What?!

07:38.090 --> 07:40.440
- Knock it down, tom!
- Shut up!

07:40.460 --> 07:41.880
You're eating up air.

07:42.800 --> 07:45.310
Tom, tom... we're
gonna burn in here, tom.

07:45.330 --> 07:47.110
All right, kid.

07:47.970 --> 07:50.030
Here. Come on.

07:55.590 --> 07:56.960
All right, all right, all right, enough.

07:56.970 --> 07:58.400
Hey! Hey!

08:05.440 --> 08:08.730
All right, one more time.
Come on, quick, quick.

08:10.380 --> 08:11.660
Enough.

08:12.520 --> 08:14.710
- Do you pray, kid?
- Yeah.

08:14.740 --> 08:17.820
Might want to get an our
father or a hail mary in.

08:17.840 --> 08:19.020
Ready to go, lou?

08:19.040 --> 08:20.310
Here, go.

08:21.480 --> 08:22.810
Enough.

08:22.840 --> 08:24.300
All right, come on.

08:24.330 --> 08:25.740
Come on, let's go.

08:25.760 --> 08:27.460
Get up, get up.

08:27.480 --> 08:29.110
All right, listen.

08:29.970 --> 08:33.260
You keep my secret,
I keep yours, got it?

08:35.559 --> 08:36.640
Hey!

08:36.659 --> 08:37.890
Sorry about that, guys.

08:37.909 --> 08:39.990
- We've been a little busy saving civilians.
- Oh, really?

08:40.010 --> 08:42.260
Yeah, plus there's a milla
jovovich poster out in the hallway.

08:42.280 --> 08:44.059
- Oh, yeah, which movie?
- Resident evil.

08:44.080 --> 08:45.910
- Ah, one or two?
- Two.Pull.

08:50.900 --> 08:52.540
You got it?

08:52.570 --> 08:54.040
There you go.

09:46.180 --> 09:48.120
Guys, all I'm saying is,

09:48.140 --> 09:50.680
you take the boston off the
front of a boston cream pie,

09:50.710 --> 09:52.610
and you have a dessert
that everybody can enjoy.

09:52.630 --> 09:55.450
How is a yankee fan supposed to
dig into that particular dessert

09:55.480 --> 09:57.380
and not feel like a
total scumbag traitor?

09:57.410 --> 09:59.690
- I just think you're overreacting.
- It kills me, every bite I take.

09:59.720 --> 10:02.090
- This is america.
- Lou.

10:02.110 --> 10:03.720
Hi, ken.

10:05.330 --> 10:07.290
Candy. Long time, no see.

10:07.310 --> 10:08.320
Who's your friend, lou?

10:08.340 --> 10:11.770
Oh, just a lovely young lady that
blew into my life a couple years ago

10:11.790 --> 10:13.860
and took about $26,000 of my money,

10:13.890 --> 10:16.600
or just about everything I
had saved up at that point.

10:16.620 --> 10:18.700
- You're looking good.
- Can we talk?

10:18.730 --> 10:21.360
Yeah, you know what, let me just
have the guys hold my wallet.

10:21.380 --> 10:23.260
I'll be right out. Go ahead.

10:26.780 --> 10:28.890
- What the hell was that about?
- I don't know.

10:28.910 --> 10:31.420
The ghost of thieving hookers past.

10:31.430 --> 10:33.270
Are you all right?

10:33.290 --> 10:35.170
Yeah, I'm all right.

10:36.210 --> 10:37.710
I'm fine.

10:41.460 --> 10:43.260
- I know I should have--
- Move.Away from the house.

10:43.280 --> 10:44.460
Move.

10:44.470 --> 10:45.930
You have got some nerve, bitch.

10:45.950 --> 10:49.190
You've got some goddamn nerve walking in
here smiling, acting like nothing happened.

10:49.210 --> 10:51.120
You want to know something, I
have never hit a woman before,

10:51.130 --> 10:53.870
but I swear to god, if I were you, I
would keep walking and walking fast.

10:53.900 --> 10:56.070
I came to tell you
how sorry I am about--

10:56.080 --> 10:57.480
About what? About what?

10:57.510 --> 10:58.940
About running away with my life savings?

10:58.970 --> 11:00.470
You could have saved
yourself a trip down here.

11:00.490 --> 11:03.390
You could have went into a hallmark and
bought a "I'm so sorry I ripped you off" card,

11:03.420 --> 11:06.150
and shoved 26 grand into
it and mailed it to me.

11:06.180 --> 11:07.550
I can pay you back most of the money.

11:07.580 --> 11:10.580
It's not about the goddamned money!

11:13.570 --> 11:15.270
You know,

11:15.300 --> 11:17.360
I don't say the words
"I love you" naturally.

11:17.390 --> 11:20.150
Those words, they just don't
form in that order in my mouth

11:20.180 --> 11:22.000
without a lot of
goddamned heavy lifting.

11:22.030 --> 11:24.410
And the fact of the matter is, I
opened up and I exposed myself to you.

11:24.430 --> 11:27.580
And then I just find out that I'm just
one more asshole in a whole line of them,

11:27.600 --> 11:29.540
just waiting to be fleeced by you!

11:29.550 --> 11:31.040
I am a different person, ken.

11:31.060 --> 11:33.880
Well, congratulations. Now screw!

11:34.700 --> 11:37.890
I've changed, but you
haven'T. I'm sure of it.

11:37.910 --> 11:40.180
You are still a good
man with a good heart.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.450
If I really needed you,
you wouldn't turn me away.

11:42.470 --> 11:44.280
Yeah, well, try me.

11:45.470 --> 11:48.320
I'm not leaving until
you're ready to talk.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.780
I'm not leaving, ken.

11:55.280 --> 11:57.450
Nope. That way.

11:57.470 --> 12:00.650
No. That way.Ok.

12:00.680 --> 12:02.090
- Hey!
- Hey.

12:02.110 --> 12:02.830
How's it going?

12:02.860 --> 12:04.370
Not too good. I've got a dilemma.

12:04.390 --> 12:05.540
You've got a dilemma.

12:05.560 --> 12:09.310
Take a look around you. The level
of need in this place is ridiculous.

12:09.340 --> 12:11.720
I have found a new sense of purpose.

12:11.740 --> 12:13.860
Listen, you don't understand.

12:13.890 --> 12:15.470
Why, they want you to kill 'em?

12:15.500 --> 12:17.880
My cats, they're very, very sick.

12:17.910 --> 12:19.260
How did you know that?

12:19.290 --> 12:20.850
I've got my ways.

12:20.880 --> 12:23.100
Oh, my god!

12:23.130 --> 12:26.440
Your father would spin in his grave if he
knew you were having sex with these old guys.

12:26.460 --> 12:29.280
Oh, please!Dad would have
given his goddamn purple heart.

12:29.300 --> 12:33.210
Besides, some of these vietnam
and gulf war vets are totally hot!

12:33.230 --> 12:35.390
And I dabbled in korea, but

12:35.420 --> 12:38.850
that's where I draw the line. Anything
beyond korea would just be gross.

12:38.870 --> 12:40.240
You have some serious issues.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.290
I got issues? You should talk to stumpy.

12:42.310 --> 12:44.110
Stumpy's number four on my list.

12:44.130 --> 12:46.090
Life without arms is no picnic.

12:46.110 --> 12:49.420
You should try scratching an itch on your
nose while you're cut off at the elbows.

12:49.450 --> 12:50.620
It's like a cat licking his balls.

12:50.640 --> 12:52.160
You know, you ought to
consider siding him up a bit.

12:52.180 --> 12:56.010
I came here to help my fellow
vets, not play angel of death.

12:56.030 --> 12:58.050
Well, I didn't come here
to play angel of sex,

12:58.070 --> 13:00.140
but sometimes the
roles we play choose us.

13:00.160 --> 13:02.510
Jesus, maggs, you're even
more twisted than I thought.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.230
Hey, ma, how'd you sleep?Ok?

13:07.250 --> 13:08.670
Not great.

13:08.680 --> 13:10.630
It's hard for me to
adjust to a new mattress.

13:10.650 --> 13:12.360
Or maybe it was those crazy sheets.

13:12.370 --> 13:14.070
Who is that little
yellow person, anyway?

13:14.090 --> 13:15.880
Oh. Spongebob squarepants.

13:15.900 --> 13:17.810
Mike said he was going to
get rid of those.I'm sorry.

13:17.840 --> 13:20.180
It's fine. I didn't
expect the four seasons.

13:21.930 --> 13:24.440
More the one
season-- winter.

13:24.460 --> 13:27.910
A/c kept kicking on every 5 minutes.I probably
have a swelling of the respiratory tract.

13:27.930 --> 13:30.570
- You have a what?
- A cold.

13:30.580 --> 13:32.310
Well, then why didn't
you just say that?A cold?

13:32.340 --> 13:35.830
Instead of coming up with some cockamamie,
fancy word that tries to make you look smart,

13:35.850 --> 13:38.730
when in reality, you still can't hold down
a job and you still live at home with ma.

13:38.750 --> 13:42.330
Ok?And could you use a
glass? Please, terrence?Jesus.

13:42.860 --> 13:45.130
I looked at your glasses,
squirt, they're filthy.

13:45.140 --> 13:46.770
I'm sorry if I don't want a rhinovirus.

13:46.790 --> 13:50.230
A what? Ma, did you
have to bring him?Really?

13:50.260 --> 13:51.710
You didn't tell me not to.

13:51.740 --> 13:54.930
Yeah, I did, ma. Like 10
times in a 3 minute phone call.

13:54.950 --> 13:57.000
It was like a chant at one point.

13:57.020 --> 13:58.900
I wanted to spend some
time alone with you.

13:58.910 --> 14:02.150
- Is this the whole cancer thing again?
- Oh, shut up, terrence.

14:02.170 --> 14:03.700
No, get over yourself, squirt.

14:03.720 --> 14:06.330
I mean, obviously you're going to milk
this cancer thing for everything you can.

14:06.340 --> 14:08.110
Which reminds me, you need more milk.

14:08.130 --> 14:08.890
You're such an asshole!

14:08.920 --> 14:11.200
Sean leslie garrity, the language!

14:11.220 --> 14:13.340
- Apologize to your older
brother. - Are you kidding me?Ma--

14:13.360 --> 14:15.630
Terrence is just trying to tell you that

14:15.650 --> 14:18.220
maybe you're getting a little self
absorbed about your health issues,

14:18.240 --> 14:20.850
which is probably why you didn't
have time to find us a hotel room

14:20.880 --> 14:23.480
after our 6-hour drive from trenton.

14:23.500 --> 14:25.380
Ok, it's not 6 hours from trenton.

14:25.400 --> 14:27.760
The turnpike was bumper to bumper.

14:27.780 --> 14:29.620
And we stopped at some outlet stores.

14:29.640 --> 14:32.930
And I didn't put you up in a hotel because
I'm spending all my money on the surgery

14:32.950 --> 14:34.730
I'm having in a couple
of days, by the way.

14:34.760 --> 14:37.430
Oh, boy.See, ma, I warned you.

14:37.450 --> 14:39.800
- He needs money.
- Oh.

14:39.820 --> 14:42.520
Look, I'll pack up,
you pull the car around.

14:42.530 --> 14:44.260
Terrence...

14:46.330 --> 14:48.030
I don't know, I just
started baking again.

14:48.050 --> 14:49.750
You know, 'cause I got a
lot of time on my hands.

14:49.770 --> 14:52.280
But I didn't want to leave
them lying around the house,

14:52.310 --> 14:54.050
because then I would
eat every last crumb

14:54.090 --> 14:56.530
and I didn't want my
ass going all ponderosa,

14:56.560 --> 14:58.880
so we thought that we
would bring them here.

14:58.900 --> 15:00.350
- Nice.
- You thought.

15:00.370 --> 15:02.780
I thought I'd like to get
to school on time.Can we go?

15:02.800 --> 15:06.370
- Hey, look.
- Ooh, lou, muffins.

15:06.390 --> 15:08.010
- You want--
- Later.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.500
What--what
is it--it's--

15:09.530 --> 15:11.500
Since when does lou not want a muffin?

15:11.520 --> 15:15.960
Revelations 2:3, and the
lieutenant shall shun baked goods.

15:15.970 --> 15:19.840
So, how was your first
fire? Were you scared?

15:19.860 --> 15:22.530
You know, a little.

15:25.280 --> 15:28.230
Not the answer that I was looking for.

15:29.020 --> 15:31.030
All right, a lot.

15:31.040 --> 15:32.840
I was scared shitless if
you want to know the truth.

15:32.870 --> 15:34.550
Yeah, well, you're scared.

15:34.570 --> 15:38.720
As soon as you don't show the
bitch some respect, that's when you

15:38.750 --> 15:40.880
have to start picking out
the kind of casket you want.

15:40.900 --> 15:44.300
You know what, how about we not
talk about caskets, 'cause...

15:44.930 --> 15:47.200
you're spoiling my muffins.

15:50.220 --> 15:51.970
I tell you what.

15:51.990 --> 15:55.310
You go back to probie school and you

15:55.330 --> 15:57.060
listen to your dis like
joe higgins and those guys,

15:57.090 --> 15:58.860
and you graduate top
of your class or close,

15:58.880 --> 16:01.900
I'll tell you what I'm
going to do.I'm gonna...

16:01.920 --> 16:05.310
put in a good word and try to get you
assigned to this house, to this crew.

16:05.320 --> 16:06.240
You can do that?

16:06.260 --> 16:08.560
Well, I never called in any
favors, so I just, you know,

16:08.590 --> 16:10.920
might as well take the opportunity.What?

16:11.910 --> 16:13.570
Thank you. Thank you.

16:13.580 --> 16:15.330
Wow, this is incredible.

16:15.350 --> 16:18.450
I'm just--I'm
really honored.

16:18.470 --> 16:20.400
Thanks, tommy.

16:21.470 --> 16:22.990
Shit, look at the time.

16:23.010 --> 16:24.320
I'm gonna go wait in the car.

16:24.340 --> 16:25.630
- Ok.
- Ok.

16:25.650 --> 16:26.850
Hey, thanks, tommy.

16:26.870 --> 16:28.950
- Ok.
- Well, you know what?

16:28.970 --> 16:31.650
I'm glad you guys are
sleeping together again.

16:31.670 --> 16:34.700
What--wait, what?
Back the truck up!

16:34.720 --> 16:36.100
What?

16:36.600 --> 16:38.590
- Well, you are, right?
- No!

16:38.610 --> 16:40.700
Oh, come on.

16:40.720 --> 16:43.090
- I know the signs.
- What signs?

16:43.110 --> 16:45.260
She's baking, she's happy.

16:45.290 --> 16:46.740
That doesn't-- And when
you use tommy's name,

16:46.770 --> 16:50.180
you say it without that, uh, "I'm gonna
chop his balls off" tone you usually have.

16:50.200 --> 16:51.220
Listen to me.

16:51.250 --> 16:53.900
Your uncle has just given you
very good news about your future.

16:53.930 --> 16:56.510
Can you not disrespect him
by talking about his balls?

16:56.530 --> 16:58.560
Come on, we're all adults here.

16:58.580 --> 17:00.050
You should do what makes you happy.

17:00.070 --> 17:03.560
Damian, for the last time, we
literally are not having sex.

17:03.580 --> 17:05.609
No--

17:05.630 --> 17:07.930
Fine.Whatever. Look, can we go, please?

17:07.940 --> 17:09.630
- I really can't be late.
- Yeah.

17:09.650 --> 17:11.109
All right. Hey, thanks again, tommy.

17:11.130 --> 17:12.660
Ok.

17:12.690 --> 17:14.710
What do you think, did he see something?

17:14.730 --> 17:16.130
Oh!

17:18.020 --> 17:22.119
I want to make something
very, very clear here.

17:22.150 --> 17:23.200
We're not gonna have sex anymore?

17:23.230 --> 17:24.609
What? No, shh.No, no,

17:24.630 --> 17:26.630
we're totally having
sex. That part is good.

17:26.650 --> 17:29.580
I don't care if you
come over to my house

17:29.610 --> 17:32.620
and drink and have sex with
me, and all that's good.

17:32.640 --> 17:37.280
I just want to make sure that
you have a handle on the booze.

17:37.300 --> 17:43.280
Because if I get one iota of
an inch of a whisper of a whiff

17:43.300 --> 17:47.800
- that you are drinking on the
job-- - I'm not drinking on the job.

17:47.830 --> 17:52.170
I'm gonna take these sensitive brown
tits right off your goddamn table.

17:52.190 --> 17:53.780
Look, I'm not drinking on the job.

17:53.800 --> 17:56.810
- Then you still have my tits.
- Ok?

17:56.840 --> 17:59.530
- Who else knows
about-- - Nobody.

17:59.550 --> 18:00.720
All right.

18:00.730 --> 18:03.400
Besides me and lou and janet?

18:03.420 --> 18:05.790
- Mike.
- Why?

18:05.810 --> 18:08.480
After I left your house that
night, I went to the bar,

18:08.500 --> 18:10.720
and we got--we got into
an argument about damian.

18:10.740 --> 18:13.130
It was--I wasn't even--
I had like 2 drinks.

18:13.140 --> 18:15.450
Damian is what I'm worried about, ok?

18:15.460 --> 18:17.620
Look, there is safety in numbers.

18:17.640 --> 18:21.890
The more guys that know, the better the
odds are of you keeping it under control.

18:21.910 --> 18:24.140
I guess I never thought of it that way.

18:24.150 --> 18:27.020
Well, do me a favor and start
thinking about it that way.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.170
Be at my house around...

18:33.190 --> 18:34.850
seven?

18:40.940 --> 18:42.290
Bye.

18:53.070 --> 18:55.840
This channel 4 weather chick can get it.

18:55.860 --> 18:57.380
Hot to death, man.

18:57.400 --> 18:59.310
No, I don't like her hair.
It's too poofy, you know?

18:59.330 --> 19:01.970
That chick on channel seven, though, with
the olive-y skin, that's who I'd bang.

19:01.990 --> 19:03.380
Well, what about the
one from channel two?

19:03.390 --> 19:06.290
- Oh, the one with the big lips, right?
- Yeah.

19:06.310 --> 19:09.290
No, no, no, her voice is too
squeaky. It's like, "nyah, nyah."

19:09.310 --> 19:10.800
- Lou?
- What?

19:10.820 --> 19:11.950
Weather chicks?

19:11.970 --> 19:14.430
You know what, the mood
I'm in, al goddamn roker.

19:14.450 --> 19:17.260
Guys, hey, hey, could you turn off the tv,
I've got an announcement I want to make.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.960
is that the channel four weather chick?

19:19.970 --> 19:20.950
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

19:20.970 --> 19:23.530
Nice tits, but hmm, spock ears.

19:23.550 --> 19:25.470
Listen, guys, I got an
announcement I'd like to make.

19:25.490 --> 19:27.560
I put a lot of thought into this.

19:28.240 --> 19:30.710
Just gonna put it out
there. I'm drinking again.

19:30.730 --> 19:33.040
Now, I know a couple of you
guys, lou and mike in particular,

19:33.060 --> 19:35.830
already have this information,
but I want you guys to know, ok?

19:35.850 --> 19:37.010
I'm not an alcoholic.

19:37.030 --> 19:38.880
I think I was going through
a rough patch and that's all.

19:38.900 --> 19:40.700
Now I'm drinking
again, I can control it,

19:40.720 --> 19:43.980
and, you know, in the spirit of the brotherhood
and working together and being 100% clear,

19:44.000 --> 19:45.880
I want to put it out
there on the table...

19:45.900 --> 19:47.760
I'm drinking again. I can control it.

19:47.780 --> 19:50.520
It's not going to
be a prob--what?

19:50.540 --> 19:52.080
You told mikey before you told me?

19:52.100 --> 19:54.570
Ok, not on purpose.
It was--shawn?

19:54.580 --> 19:56.210
Does this mean it's ok
for everybody to know?

19:56.220 --> 19:57.690
Yeah, like I said, I'm not an alcoholic.

19:57.710 --> 19:59.500
I really don't
care who--yeah?

19:59.520 --> 20:01.590
Goddamn probie gets
the info before I do?

20:01.610 --> 20:03.190
I'm not a goddamn probie anymore.

20:03.210 --> 20:04.510
You didn't raise your hand, asshole.

20:04.530 --> 20:05.920
Guys, would you
please-- yeah, shawn?

20:05.930 --> 20:07.910
- So I can tell colleen?
- Yes.

20:07.940 --> 20:11.500
No.Let me--let me clarify. Mike, yeah,
I know, you're not the probie anymore.

20:11.520 --> 20:12.190
I have to go to the bathroom.

20:12.210 --> 20:14.460
Ok, you know what, do me a
favor and don't tell colleen.

20:14.480 --> 20:16.710
Maybe tell everybody else,
but just don't tell colleen.

20:16.730 --> 20:18.180
- Full disclosure?
- Full disclosure.

20:18.200 --> 20:20.100
- Except colleen.
- Right.Ok, mike.

20:20.120 --> 20:20.860
You can go to the bathroom.

20:20.880 --> 20:24.360
No, no, I was just curious.
What does "full disclosure" mean?

20:24.390 --> 20:25.600
You can tell everybody.

20:25.610 --> 20:26.110
What?

20:26.140 --> 20:28.590
So is there any protocol
on how we tell people?

20:28.610 --> 20:31.460
Like, I don't know, oldest,
dearest, closest friends first,

20:31.480 --> 20:33.890
or is it the reverse, the
guy you barely know or trust,

20:33.910 --> 20:35.580
the probie who doesn't
think he's a probie anymore

20:35.590 --> 20:36.980
'cause there's another
probie in the house?

20:37.000 --> 20:40.420
- This is bullshit.
- Hey, hand, probie, hand, ok?

20:40.430 --> 20:41.830
I bet you told derek the bar back, too.

20:41.850 --> 20:44.340
No, I did not tell derek the
bar back, but you know what,

20:44.360 --> 20:46.520
that's probably a good idea.Don't
tell derek the bar back,

20:46.540 --> 20:48.080
because he's my sponsee.

20:48.100 --> 20:50.600
Actually, don't tell mickey,
either, because I'm his sponsee.

20:50.620 --> 20:52.100
So just
don't--yeah, mike.

20:52.120 --> 20:52.880
What about garrity?

20:52.910 --> 20:54.340
Oh, my god, don't tell me
he already told garrity, too!

20:54.380 --> 20:55.830
Hand, asshole, hands!

20:55.860 --> 20:57.290
- I'm gonna take my
hand-- - Hey, hey, hey--

21:02.450 --> 21:03.550
Not the hands.

21:03.580 --> 21:05.270
Come on, you've got your
first sparring match tonight.

21:05.290 --> 21:07.410
- Easy on the hands.
- Christ!

21:07.900 --> 21:10.440
- All right, so are we clear?
- Yes.

21:10.450 --> 21:12.810
Everybody knows what
to-- what's what?

21:12.840 --> 21:15.040
- Yeah, gotcha.
- Ok.I just--

21:15.070 --> 21:17.820
you know, I'm going
to say that I--

21:17.840 --> 21:19.740
you guys are, you know,
you're my brothers and I just,

21:19.770 --> 21:24.900
I really appreciate you letting
me unload and get that off my...

21:25.620 --> 21:27.600
means a lot.

21:28.810 --> 21:32.170
So we're supposed to tell
everyone except garrity, right?

21:32.190 --> 21:33.390
No, no, no.

21:33.410 --> 21:35.190
We tell garrity and everyone else,

21:35.210 --> 21:36.980
but we don't tell colleen, right?

21:36.990 --> 21:38.950
And we don't tell derek.

21:38.980 --> 21:40.410
Guys.

21:41.330 --> 21:43.620
It's very simple.

21:43.640 --> 21:45.710
- Garrity knows.
- Cool.

21:45.730 --> 21:47.320
- Got it.
- Got it.

21:47.340 --> 21:48.760
- Yeah.
- We got it.

21:48.780 --> 21:49.290
- Ok.
- We got it.

21:49.310 --> 21:50.610
- Good.
- No problem.

21:50.630 --> 21:52.840
So mickey we tell?

21:52.860 --> 21:56.170
- Right.
- No, no, no, no.

21:56.190 --> 21:59.020
Mickey, garrity, colleen, they
don't get to know anything, ok?

21:59.040 --> 21:59.940
Nothing. Ok?

21:59.960 --> 22:02.590
And anybody else can
know the whole thing.

22:02.620 --> 22:03.390
- Everything.
- Yes.

22:03.420 --> 22:04.910
Oh.

22:05.530 --> 22:06.950
Everybody knows what?

22:12.680 --> 22:14.090
Nothing.

22:14.110 --> 22:17.320
Tommy isn't drinking still, anymore.

22:17.340 --> 22:19.630
- Right?
- Right.

22:20.860 --> 22:21.710
Good for you.

22:21.730 --> 22:24.690
Turn on channel four. The chick
with the tits is in a hurricane.

22:28.760 --> 22:31.030
Lester, what the hell happened?

22:31.050 --> 22:32.900
You were doing so good the other day.

22:32.920 --> 22:38.260
When you're 87, good days don't last.

22:38.280 --> 22:39.500
You've come to kill me?

22:39.530 --> 22:41.100
Oh, knock it off, will you?

22:41.120 --> 22:42.920
You want prune juice, I'm your man.

22:42.940 --> 22:45.430
Angel of death, you've
got to look elsewhere.

22:45.450 --> 22:47.770
I don't have long.

22:48.230 --> 22:50.800
My breathing is shot.

22:50.820 --> 22:54.460
That means it's almost over.

22:54.470 --> 22:59.480
If I could only talk to my son one

22:59.500 --> 23:02.580
last time,

23:02.610 --> 23:04.190
make things right.

23:04.210 --> 23:06.770
- You had a falling out?
- Terrible.

23:06.790 --> 23:08.960
- He a queer?
- No.

23:08.980 --> 23:10.680
He married a jap chick.

23:10.690 --> 23:14.030
After serving in the big
one, I was against it.

23:14.060 --> 23:15.730
A jap chink?

23:15.750 --> 23:19.120
Chick. A jap chick.

23:19.130 --> 23:23.780
Oh, that's good, because a jap
chink--I don't think you can do both.

23:23.800 --> 23:27.490
I haven't talked to my
boy in over 25 years.

23:27.510 --> 23:30.390
He lives 2 towns over.

23:30.420 --> 23:32.050
Not a word.

23:32.070 --> 23:35.730
What's his name? Arthur frost.

23:36.050 --> 23:41.940
He...he has a financial
consulting business in salem.

23:41.950 --> 23:45.550
You hang in there. I'll
bring your boy here.

23:45.570 --> 23:47.230
Don't worry.

23:47.240 --> 23:49.910
What, what is it,
pal? What is--oh, god!

23:49.930 --> 23:52.830
I'm standing on your oxygen
tube. What nitwit put that there?

23:52.860 --> 23:55.470
You're all right now.
Yeah, that's it.Breath deep.

23:55.490 --> 23:57.020
Sit tight.

24:01.730 --> 24:03.600
Hey, fellas.

24:04.750 --> 24:06.420
How's it going?

24:06.440 --> 24:08.200
- Good.
- Great.

24:08.230 --> 24:09.310
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

24:09.330 --> 24:11.130
Yeah, never been better.

24:12.330 --> 24:14.030
Good sandwiches?

24:14.540 --> 24:17.290
- Off the chain.
- Killer.

24:19.290 --> 24:22.520
- Listen, is-- -
Tommy is doing great.

24:24.120 --> 24:25.680
Awesome.

24:25.700 --> 24:27.060
- No drinking.
- Nothing.

24:27.090 --> 24:29.110
- Not a drop.
- Nada.

24:29.130 --> 24:31.320
Coffee.

24:31.340 --> 24:33.620
- Yeah, coffee.
- Yeah.

24:33.640 --> 24:38.540
Well, he drinks so much coffee
that we call him the coffee king.

24:38.550 --> 24:40.810
Who calls him that, dude?

24:40.830 --> 24:44.470
Everybody who's cool, mikey.

24:47.790 --> 24:49.550
Now, I can go in there and get him,

24:49.570 --> 24:52.430
because he's probably in the
kitchen making more coffee,

24:52.450 --> 24:54.200
because he's the coffee king.

24:54.220 --> 24:57.620
That won't be necessary.

24:57.640 --> 25:00.380
I already know what I need to know.

25:04.430 --> 25:06.610
He drinks coffee.

25:06.630 --> 25:08.380
Shit, dude.

25:08.400 --> 25:10.970
Listen, that guy wasn't here, all right?

25:10.980 --> 25:13.490
We didn't talk to
him, we don't know him.

25:13.510 --> 25:14.630
We don't know who the hell he is.

25:14.640 --> 25:16.660
I mean, that's tommy's cousin mickey.

25:17.690 --> 25:19.440
Just eat your sandwich, ok?

25:23.150 --> 25:24.980
Hey.

25:24.990 --> 25:27.070
How are them sandwiches? Good, right?

25:27.090 --> 25:29.290
Oh, great.

25:29.310 --> 25:31.900
Hey, is that my cousin mickey's car?

25:31.920 --> 25:35.140
- No.
- Yes.

25:42.600 --> 25:43.980
Hey, ma.

25:46.050 --> 25:47.850
Hello?

25:48.810 --> 25:50.150
What are you watching?

25:50.170 --> 25:51.730
I don't know.

25:51.740 --> 25:54.350
The people on these reality
shows, they're just pathetic.

25:54.380 --> 25:56.320
Yeah. Yeah.

25:56.340 --> 25:57.660
I'm glad you came.

25:57.690 --> 26:00.530
I know I haven't exactly been
the best son in terms of visiting

26:00.560 --> 26:02.190
and calling and all that, but

26:02.220 --> 26:05.420
I really appreciate you being here so,
what with everything that's going on.

26:05.450 --> 26:07.330
You mean the cancer?

26:07.350 --> 26:09.870
Yes, I mean--yeah,
the cancer.

26:09.890 --> 26:11.760
It's a pretty big deal for me, so.

26:11.780 --> 26:14.550
But you're having it taken
care of, so that's good.

26:14.560 --> 26:16.760
Yeah, I am getting it taken care of,

26:16.780 --> 26:18.280
but it's still a big deal, you know.

26:18.300 --> 26:19.650
- I mean, it's cancer.
- Hey, ma.

26:19.670 --> 26:21.100
- It's not like-- -
Sorry to interrupt.

26:21.130 --> 26:22.510
Well, not really.

26:22.530 --> 26:24.000
Hey, look, I just made a B.M.

26:24.030 --> 26:25.730
And I'm a little concerned
because it's loose

26:25.760 --> 26:27.920
and has got kind of a green hue to
it. Will you come take a look at it?

26:27.940 --> 26:29.290
Yeah, let me check.

26:29.310 --> 26:31.170
I'm sorry, I was just trying
to talk to you about my cancer,

26:31.190 --> 26:33.270
and you were acting
like it's no big deal.

26:33.290 --> 26:34.870
And then he just took a big green shit,

26:34.900 --> 26:36.890
and you're ready to, like, jump out
of the chair.So I don't understand.

26:36.920 --> 26:39.010
Here he goes again. "Look
at me, I got cancer."

26:39.030 --> 26:40.660
You know, at least
you know what you have.

26:40.680 --> 26:43.530
Green fecal matter could indicate
any number of health irregularities.

26:43.550 --> 26:45.330
Well, excuse me for
freaking out a little bit

26:45.350 --> 26:48.070
that I might actually
die from my cancer, ok.

26:48.070 --> 26:50.810
You're not gonna die from a big,
dumb, green shit that you just-- Shh.

26:50.820 --> 26:52.530
Sorry.That you just
took in the toilet unless

26:52.550 --> 26:54.280
it's sitting there with a goddamn gun.

26:54.300 --> 26:55.670
- Sean!
- Sorry.I'm sorry.

26:55.690 --> 26:57.310
How'd you get this cancer anyway?

26:57.320 --> 26:59.950
Kidney cancer accounts
for 3% of all cancers.

26:59.970 --> 27:03.220
And its victims are typically
between 50 and 70 years old.

27:03.230 --> 27:05.730
I mean, you can't even get a
terminal disease right, squirt.

27:05.750 --> 27:06.860
Mom.

27:06.870 --> 27:10.150
It's amazing how he knows these
facts. But he always liked to read.

27:10.170 --> 27:11.840
You should have read more, sean.

27:11.860 --> 27:13.730
Come on, sweetheart, let's have a look.

27:13.750 --> 27:15.160
So selfish.

27:20.590 --> 27:22.360
I want you to give him
everything you got, chuckie.

27:22.380 --> 27:23.540
All right? You do not hold back.

27:23.560 --> 27:26.320
He gives you the opening,
you take him down, ok?

27:26.340 --> 27:27.860
You got that?

27:27.880 --> 27:29.860
Any of this getting through?

27:29.880 --> 27:31.540
I'm banging your wife.

27:32.340 --> 27:34.780
Your mother's a whore.

27:34.800 --> 27:38.410
I heard you like
little boys. No?Nothin'.

27:38.430 --> 27:39.310
Ok, then.

27:39.330 --> 27:40.470
How you feeling, kid? You loose?

27:40.490 --> 27:42.340
Yeah.

27:43.670 --> 27:46.530
No.This guy looks a little
bit questionable, chief.

27:46.550 --> 27:48.160
I mean, is he in the department or what?

27:48.170 --> 27:50.220
- He's in the system.
- The system?

27:50.240 --> 27:52.550
- All right, well, what system?
- The penal system.

27:52.570 --> 27:55.970
Killed a guy with his thumb. Allegedly.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.400
Don't worry, he's wearing gloves.

27:57.420 --> 28:00.230
Look, the point is he's not an
old man, so keep your hands up.

28:00.250 --> 28:02.620
You lose this bout, lou's never
gonna let you back in the ring again.

28:02.640 --> 28:03.750
- All right?
- Yeah.

28:03.770 --> 28:06.260
- Feel good?
- Yeah.

28:06.820 --> 28:08.050
No.

28:08.070 --> 28:10.010
No, something--it just
doesn't feel right, chief.

28:10.030 --> 28:11.250
Hey, hey, frank.

28:11.270 --> 28:13.160
You don't do anything you
don't want to do, all right?

28:14.050 --> 28:16.130
Just so you know, this
guy voted for bush.

28:16.150 --> 28:17.110
Twice.

28:17.130 --> 28:19.740
And the way I hear it, when
he says his prayers at night,

28:19.750 --> 28:23.070
he thanks god almighty bush
junior was in office when 9/11 hit.

28:23.090 --> 28:27.910
And anyone who thinks it was an
inside job is a traitor and a coward.

28:27.920 --> 28:29.430
I know what you're doing, chief.

28:29.450 --> 28:31.950
Is it working? Yeah, a little bit.

28:32.680 --> 28:34.750
Kick his ass, all right?

28:41.340 --> 28:42.920
Come on, frankie.

28:42.930 --> 28:45.500
Use your feet, franco, use your feet.

28:48.100 --> 28:49.590
Come on, frank!

28:51.740 --> 28:54.190
Let's go, frankie!

28:54.200 --> 28:56.450
Get those arms up, frankie. Come on.

28:58.450 --> 29:00.350
Let's go, frankie. Come on.Come on.

29:06.300 --> 29:08.130
I think frankie's ready.

29:08.150 --> 29:10.240
I think chuckie's dead.

29:10.250 --> 29:11.500
Get the car.

29:16.830 --> 29:18.630
Right in here.

29:19.450 --> 29:20.710
You can do it, artie.

29:20.730 --> 29:22.540
It's been too long.

29:22.560 --> 29:23.950
You don't have to say anything.

29:23.980 --> 29:27.960
He wants to offer you an olive
branch. Let him do the talking.

29:30.380 --> 29:32.530
It's almost over.

29:33.660 --> 29:35.590
He looks terrible.

29:40.690 --> 29:42.990
Arthur?

29:43.010 --> 29:44.870
Son?

29:44.890 --> 29:47.010
I'm here, pop.

29:47.030 --> 29:49.740
My son.

29:50.640 --> 29:54.210
After so long, my boy's here.

29:54.230 --> 29:56.150
I told you I'd bring him.

29:56.170 --> 29:59.070
Let me look at you.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.780
How are you, boy?

30:02.800 --> 30:05.790
I'm good, pop. I'm good.

30:14.200 --> 30:17.510
And how's that goop bitch of yours?

30:18.170 --> 30:19.600
You prick.

30:19.610 --> 30:23.150
She home, or is she out in a rice paddy?

30:23.160 --> 30:25.500
Go to hell.

30:26.260 --> 30:29.250
Thanks for dragging me down
here, you son of a bitch.

30:29.270 --> 30:35.320
Ooh, me love you long
time, joe. Heh heh heh!

30:40.740 --> 30:44.290
Now I can die.

30:45.320 --> 30:47.250
I--yeah, I just don't
see what the big deal is.

30:47.280 --> 30:50.480
If he knows we're having sex,
why can't I stay over, you know?

30:50.500 --> 30:55.030
Because "a," he doesn't definitely
know that we're having sex.

30:55.050 --> 30:58.280
And 2, this is like
my last time with him.

30:58.310 --> 31:00.440
He's gonna graduate from the academy and

31:00.460 --> 31:03.750
go to the firehouse and probably
want to move out on his own.

31:03.770 --> 31:04.960
It's like my last hurrah.

31:04.980 --> 31:06.250
- Yeah.
- Ok?

31:06.280 --> 31:09.020
You know what, when we
move to the new place,

31:09.040 --> 31:11.090
maybe I'll let you stay
over a couple of nights.

31:11.100 --> 31:13.810
I feel like a goddamn hooker.

31:13.830 --> 31:15.470
What's with the new place, by the way?

31:15.490 --> 31:17.780
Well, it's smaller.

31:17.800 --> 31:20.810
It's, um, more
intimate.It has a washer--

31:20.840 --> 31:22.580
It's closer to the firehouse.

31:22.600 --> 31:24.230
You got to cut the
cord, I'm telling you.

31:24.250 --> 31:26.470
Because, you know,
once the kids sees--

31:26.490 --> 31:27.700
he's almost out of the academy now.

31:27.730 --> 31:29.200
When he comes out and
gets into the fires,

31:29.220 --> 31:31.520
you can't be dropping by
unannounced all the time.

31:31.540 --> 31:34.500
It's embarrassing. The guys
will be busting his balls.

31:34.520 --> 31:36.050
- Really?
- Yeah.

31:36.070 --> 31:38.160
You're gonna talk to me
about cutting the cord?

31:38.900 --> 31:40.170
What?

31:40.180 --> 31:41.680
Janet.

31:41.700 --> 31:44.700
Ok, off-limits. Wife.

31:44.730 --> 31:46.520
What is it with the two of you?

31:46.540 --> 31:49.470
It's like she's the goddamn
death star, and she keeps, like,

31:49.490 --> 31:53.750
pulling you back into her,
like, warped, blonde black hole.

31:53.770 --> 31:55.790
Whatever. Can I have another
glass of wine, please?

31:55.800 --> 31:57.680
You don't love her.

31:57.700 --> 31:59.110
- I love her.
- No, you don'T.

31:59.120 --> 32:00.020
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don'T.

32:00.040 --> 32:02.070
Don't tell me--give me
a glass of wine.Please.

32:02.100 --> 32:03.440
You don't need her.

32:03.460 --> 32:07.180
You just don't want to lose her, right,

32:07.200 --> 32:11.630
because you're tommy gavin and nobody
walks away from tommy gavin, right?

32:11.650 --> 32:14.690
Especially not his wife. Right?

32:14.710 --> 32:18.500
It's like you just keep circling around.

32:18.520 --> 32:22.350
Ok, and you're never gonna
move forward like that, tommy.

32:22.360 --> 32:27.390
It's like you're an army guy
or like this general, like,

32:27.410 --> 32:30.790
who's really strong
enough and brave enough,

32:30.810 --> 32:36.010
but he just keeps, you know, fighting
the same battle and taking the same hill.

32:36.030 --> 32:38.630
Now get out because
I gotta do the dishes.

32:38.650 --> 32:41.810
My purse is over there.
You can take 20 bucks.

32:43.180 --> 32:45.300
- Give me a glass of wine.
- No!

32:45.320 --> 32:48.210
I said that you could drink,
not get drunk.Just drink.

32:48.240 --> 32:52.060
I'm not getting drunk. I'm
asking for another glass.Come on.

32:52.080 --> 32:52.960
- No.
- Give me the bottle.

32:52.970 --> 32:54.830
No. No. Give me the...

32:56.710 --> 32:58.600
give me the bottle.

33:15.930 --> 33:18.630
- Let me ask you something.
- Yeah?

33:18.640 --> 33:22.840
- Um, is it better with me or with her?
- Her.

33:24.110 --> 33:25.520
- You.
- That's good.

33:25.530 --> 33:27.610
Ok, here's another thing.

33:27.630 --> 33:31.230
- What? - Um, I
want you to promise--

33:31.840 --> 33:36.430
That you are never going to make
love to me and her on the same day.

33:37.140 --> 33:39.440
- Well, how am I
gonna-- - Zip it.

33:39.460 --> 33:41.950
- That's an
impossible-- - Promise.

33:41.970 --> 33:44.370
Vow it.

33:45.370 --> 33:46.770
Ok.

33:48.270 --> 33:49.410
Mom, do you
know where--

33:49.430 --> 33:52.420
oh, I'm sorry, I didn't
know anyone else was here.

33:52.440 --> 33:55.080
- Yes, please.
- Yeah?

33:55.090 --> 33:57.990
Oh, just, you know, your
mom's having some wine.

33:58.010 --> 33:58.800
Thank you.

33:58.820 --> 34:01.060
I'm looking for my red shirt.
You know, my favorite one.

34:01.080 --> 34:02.300
I got band rehearsal with the guys.

34:02.310 --> 34:04.410
I was wondering maybe you packed it or.

34:04.430 --> 34:05.580
What? I don't know.What?

34:05.600 --> 34:07.350
Shirt. He's looking
for the--what color?

34:07.370 --> 34:08.440
- The red shirt.
- The red shirt.

34:08.460 --> 34:09.260
Yes, I packed it.

34:09.270 --> 34:10.469
- Packed.
- Packed.She packed it.

34:10.500 --> 34:11.840
Thanks. See you later.

34:11.850 --> 34:13.179
Ok.

34:13.199 --> 34:15.600
Jesus.

34:15.630 --> 34:16.989
Oh, my god.

34:17.010 --> 34:19.670
- Do you think he knows?
- That made my upper lip sweat.

34:19.690 --> 34:22.150
Um, the sex? Yeah, he knows about that.

34:22.179 --> 34:26.500
But the booze, i think that we covered
that up really nicely with the...

34:29.500 --> 34:31.429
Come in.

34:32.690 --> 34:34.270
Hey, ma.

34:34.290 --> 34:36.199
You should be sleeping.
You need your rest.

34:36.210 --> 34:39.199
Yeah, I know, I just--I'm
gonna turn in in a minute.

34:39.219 --> 34:40.389
Terrence still up?

34:40.409 --> 34:42.560
Yeah, yeah. He's watching adult swim.

34:43.239 --> 34:46.760
- You boys and your sports programs.
- Yeah.

34:48.350 --> 34:50.250
Thanks for coming, ma.

34:50.270 --> 34:54.980
I've been having a hard time lately.
I'm all alone on this one.And I

34:54.989 --> 34:58.430
haven't really talked to the
guys in the firehouse about it.so,

34:59.870 --> 35:01.610
you know, I really
appreciate you being here.

35:01.630 --> 35:05.700
It makes it seem a
little less, uh, you know.

35:07.940 --> 35:10.690
I'm afraid, though,
ma. I'm pretty scared.

35:10.710 --> 35:13.130
You, the big firefighter?
You're not scared.

35:13.150 --> 35:15.700
Yeah, I am, ma. There's a lot
of stuff I haven't done yet.

35:15.720 --> 35:17.640
- And if I die--
- You won't die.

35:17.660 --> 35:19.690
Ma, you don't know
that. This is cancer, ok?

35:19.710 --> 35:22.480
It's not like a cold or a
big, green turd.It's serious.

35:22.500 --> 35:25.140
- I'm here, aren't I?
- What are you talking about?

35:25.160 --> 35:26.950
I beat it, you can beat it, too.

35:26.970 --> 35:28.960
What do you mean you beat
it? You didn't have cancer.

35:28.980 --> 35:30.650
I did, yeah.

35:30.660 --> 35:32.990
2 years after you were born.

35:33.010 --> 35:34.650
I was watching the
today show one morning,

35:34.670 --> 35:37.310
and they did this segment on
checking yourself for lumps,

35:37.330 --> 35:39.320
you know, checking your breasts.

35:39.340 --> 35:44.460
I remember I was sitting there with a cup
of coffee and a bowl of kellogg's all-bran.

35:44.490 --> 35:46.580
I can still see it.

35:46.600 --> 35:50.590
I slid my hand inside my
robe, and I felt a lump.

35:50.610 --> 35:54.140
My whole world--the
ceiling fell in on me.

35:54.160 --> 35:55.600
Well, what happened?

35:55.620 --> 35:57.760
Well, it turned out fine, obviously.

35:57.780 --> 36:00.090
I had surgery, they caught it in time.

36:00.110 --> 36:02.320
Just like they're gonna catch yours.

36:04.030 --> 36:06.100
Why didn't you ever tell me that?

36:06.120 --> 36:08.220
I just did.

36:13.110 --> 36:15.300
Go to bed, my handsome boy.

36:15.320 --> 36:17.480
All right. Thanks, ma.

36:17.490 --> 36:19.940
I'm handsome, too!

37:04.830 --> 37:07.280
Hey!Guys, hold up. Hold up.Mike.

37:07.300 --> 37:09.180
What are you doing, dude?
We had a good thing going.

37:09.200 --> 37:10.190
Yeah, but I got an idea.

37:10.210 --> 37:12.940
What if, uh, what if at
the end of that chorus,

37:12.960 --> 37:14.980
instead of going right
into the next verse,

37:15.000 --> 37:18.180
rob does a kick-ass fill for 2 bars,

37:18.210 --> 37:20.520
and then we come in singing
halftime for the first 2 lines.

37:20.540 --> 37:22.220
And then we kick back
into regular time after.

37:22.240 --> 37:23.890
It sounds good the
way it was, all right?

37:23.910 --> 37:26.240
I just think it needs to be broken
up a bit, don't you guys think?

37:26.260 --> 37:27.500
I don't know. I like the idea.

37:27.520 --> 37:29.430
That's just because you want
to do a kick-ass fill, dude.

37:29.450 --> 37:31.390
Come on, mike.Why don't we
at least give it a shot, man?

37:31.410 --> 37:33.310
Look, guys, this is my band, all right?

37:33.330 --> 37:34.910
I'm the leader. I'm the one paying you.

37:34.930 --> 37:37.670
We're gonna go with my
musical sense and my direction.

37:37.690 --> 37:39.490
All right?

37:45.520 --> 37:46.970
You know what, I got an idea.

37:46.990 --> 37:49.380
Um, after that second chorus, instead
of going right back into the verse,

37:49.400 --> 37:50.640
why don't you do like,

37:50.670 --> 37:52.220
you know, a cool, like,
drum lick or something,

37:52.250 --> 37:54.980
then we'll go back
into the verse halftime.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.770
I think you're right, mike.

37:56.790 --> 37:59.340
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.020
Sounds great.

38:01.040 --> 38:02.820
- Thanks.
- Sounds awesome.

38:02.830 --> 38:05.180
I was--I was
really--I'm impressed.

38:05.190 --> 38:07.600
You gonna maybe stick
around for a couple tunes?

38:07.620 --> 38:09.870
No, I just came in to
have one for the road.

38:14.650 --> 38:16.160
See ya later.

38:16.180 --> 38:18.060
- See you, tommy.
- See you later.

38:18.090 --> 38:19.770
Thanks.

38:24.220 --> 38:26.820
See, I told you he's
got it under control.

38:26.840 --> 38:28.480
Yeah, I guess so.
