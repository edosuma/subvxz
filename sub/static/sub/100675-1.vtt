Alright you guys

00:25.910 --> 00:27.442

00:27.444 --> 00:29.144
Okay, now before we do that I do
have a

00:29.146 --> 00:30.713
special announcement to make for
you guys.

00:30.715 --> 00:31.716
One of you!

00:31.916 --> 00:33.281
One of you!

00:33.283 --> 00:34.482
Is gonna be moving up the ladder

00:34.484 --> 00:38.355
in this hectic and demanding
world that we call business.

00:39.023 --> 00:41.624
Okay. Now he's been with
the company around, uh,

00:41.626 --> 00:42.660
eight years now.

00:42.894 --> 00:44.727
Uh, and he's worked his freaking
butt off.

00:44.729 --> 00:45.795
That's the thing about it,

00:45.797 --> 00:47.162
worked his freaking butt off.

00:47.164 --> 00:48.764
And I think you may know his
name,

00:48.766 --> 00:50.032
I'm not entirely sure,

00:50.034 --> 00:51.934
maybe it goes a little something
like what is it, what, what?

00:51.936 --> 00:53.236
Joh-John Lee!

00:53.437 --> 00:54.536
Okay!

00:54.538 --> 00:55.605

00:55.607 --> 00:57.172
Alright, alright, okay!

00:57.174 --> 00:58.641
John! We're so proud of you!

00:58.643 --> 00:59.709
We're so proud of you!

00:59.711 --> 01:00.710
Your work is just super!

01:00.712 --> 01:03.411

Right, so let's drop a beat huh!

01:06.851 --> 01:07.852

say.

01:11.756 --> 01:13.323
RTM is here to stay!

01:13.891 --> 01:16.224
Kicking butt and taking names!

01:16.226 --> 01:18.360
Having fun and selling things!

01:18.362 --> 01:20.462
Last quarter was a stellar one!

01:20.464 --> 01:22.598
And Sydney won a staple gun!

01:23.835 --> 01:25.968
Call those clients and make
those orders,

01:25.970 --> 01:28.403
and let's have an even better
quarter guys!

01:28.405 --> 01:29.537

01:30.675 --> 01:31.774
RTM!

01:31.776 --> 01:33.143
Strikes again! Ay!

01:33.477 --> 01:35.343
Keep it going guys!

01:35.345 --> 01:37.214
Alright, that's pretty good!

01:40.718 --> 01:44.454
No it was
some kind of little rooster...

02:02.439 --> 02:03.841
No! No you, of course.

02:04.441 --> 02:06.944
No I didn't say
that of course you can.

02:09.346 --> 02:11.214
Yeah no, I did, I did finish.

02:11.649 --> 02:12.715
Everything that.

02:14.018 --> 02:16.286
Uhm, that I was supposed to so.

02:17.487 --> 02:18.488

I was trying to kiss you.

02:26.463 --> 02:28.365
Oh, that's nice. Uhm just.

02:28.966 --> 02:31.466

Uhm.

02:32.603 --> 02:33.604
Yeah, uh...

02:34.706 --> 02:36.404
Sorry I lost my train of
thought,

02:36.406 --> 02:37.675
but can I call you back?

02:38.976 --> 02:40.712
Hey, don't forget you have that,

02:41.045 --> 02:43.278
- doctor's appointment tomorrow.
- I know.

02:43.280 --> 02:44.082
Okay.

02:44.548 --> 02:47.384
Daddy's getting
his first prostate exam!

02:47.819 --> 02:48.820
Yes he is!

02:49.219 --> 02:50.420
Okay, okay.

02:50.855 --> 02:52.690
Daddy's growing up so fast!

02:53.124 --> 02:54.489
Just like you!

02:55.960 --> 02:57.695
Look at daddy!

03:58.689 --> 03:59.991
Mr. Gutchell?

04:10.668 --> 04:11.669
Turn around.

04:17.074 --> 04:18.041
Okay.

04:27.685 --> 04:28.686
I just-

04:40.497 --> 04:42.765
This will only hurt for a
second.

05:22.940 --> 05:24.006
Stop.

05:24.008 --> 05:25.475
Just try it.

05:28.613 --> 05:30.748
- What, what are you doing?
- Please.

05:40.658 --> 05:41.859
Chip come on, stop.

05:43.794 --> 05:45.493
No, you know what, I'm, I'm

05:45.495 --> 05:46.898
I'm done, thanks, yeah.

07:09.847 --> 07:11.849
Chip have you seen the remote?

07:13.651 --> 07:14.652
What?

07:15.219 --> 07:16.954
Have you seen the remote?

07:18.856 --> 07:19.857
No.

07:22.960 --> 07:24.962
I'm going out tonight.

07:27.698 --> 07:28.733
With your girls?

07:29.734 --> 07:30.735
- Yeah.

07:32.636 --> 07:34.138
What time you gonna be home?

07:35.906 --> 07:36.907
- Late.

07:39.677 --> 07:40.678
Alright.

08:04.068 --> 08:05.970
Yes! Oh yes!

08:07.004 --> 08:08.005
Oh god!

08:35.066 --> 08:36.067
Rocky!

08:37.301 --> 08:38.302
Rocky!

08:52.283 --> 08:53.284
Hey Anne.

08:55.152 --> 08:56.385
Why don't you, uh,

08:56.387 --> 08:58.689
take him home for a nap,
I'll finish up here.

08:58.889 --> 08:59.890
You sure.

09:01.392 --> 09:02.593
Okay.

09:17.241 --> 09:19.208
You haven't seen
any suspicious characters

09:19.210 --> 09:20.476
going around?

09:20.478 --> 09:22.780
- I don't think so.
- Driving on the street slow.

09:23.180 --> 09:25.149
Not that I've noticed, uhm.

09:26.383 --> 09:28.283
You said it was at the park?

09:28.285 --> 09:29.318
Yeah!

09:29.320 --> 09:30.888
I said at the park, yeah.

09:31.455 --> 09:34.158
I mean,
we were just there this morning.

09:34.792 --> 09:37.392
When you say we,
who else was there?

09:37.394 --> 09:40.129
Oh, my husband and I.
We were just there.

09:40.131 --> 09:41.230
Is your husband here?

09:41.232 --> 09:44.902
He is yeah,
I don't think he saw anything.

09:45.936 --> 09:48.305
Is it possible I
can speak to your husband?

09:48.506 --> 09:50.141
Yeah of course!

09:51.742 --> 09:52.743
Chip!

09:55.446 --> 09:56.647
Chip!

10:04.755 --> 10:05.756
Chip.

10:06.090 --> 10:07.858
Are you gonna answer them?

10:08.225 --> 10:09.960
Sir, when were you at the park?

10:11.762 --> 10:12.763
Uhm.

10:13.964 --> 10:14.965
Like nine.

10:15.299 --> 10:16.300
Nine.

10:17.034 --> 10:18.300
Nine.

10:18.302 --> 10:21.005
You didn't see, or happen to
notice a boy with his mother.

10:23.874 --> 10:24.875
No.

10:27.077 --> 10:28.210
Okay.

10:28.212 --> 10:30.345
We're gonna have to get a full
report from you guys.

10:30.347 --> 10:32.116
Start writing this down.

10:32.416 --> 10:34.883
And also if
you have any flashlights,

10:34.885 --> 10:38.220
it would be helpful, if you can start
looking with the rest of the community

10:38.222 --> 10:40.122
we got everybody looking right
now.

10:40.124 --> 10:41.759
- Absolutely.
- Right.

10:41.992 --> 10:43.225
Appreciate that.

10:43.227 --> 10:44.228
Yeah.

13:10.274 --> 13:11.674
You guys hear about the kid

13:11.676 --> 13:13.175
that went missing this morning.

13:13.177 --> 13:15.377
What I don't
understand is the parents.

13:15.379 --> 13:18.581
How does a
mother take a baby boy to the park

13:18.583 --> 13:21.251
- and let this happen?
- Someone who can just take a child.

13:22.152 --> 13:24.953
If you
have any information please

13:24.955 --> 13:27.191
contact your local authorities
hotline.

13:27.659 --> 13:30.392
Our thoughts and prayers go
out to the family and loved ones

13:30.394 --> 13:32.262
at this very difficult time.

15:46.530 --> 15:48.633
Sorry I'm late.

15:50.534 --> 15:51.535
Hi!

15:53.270 --> 15:54.271
It's okay!

15:54.606 --> 15:57.107
We're always welcoming new
faces around here.

16:04.616 --> 16:05.617
Hi.

16:06.818 --> 16:08.018
I'm Nelson.

16:09.386 --> 16:10.688
Hi, have a seat.

16:11.689 --> 16:12.690
Make your, uh,

16:13.357 --> 16:15.359
Make yourself comfortable and
uh...

16:16.159 --> 16:17.160
relax! Relax.

16:18.161 --> 16:19.363
Okay, you are here.

16:23.133 --> 16:24.134
So...

16:25.003 --> 16:27.672
how about you introduce
yourself to the group?

16:30.173 --> 16:31.174
Yeah, uhm.

16:33.544 --> 16:34.679
My name is Russel.

16:37.347 --> 16:38.348
And uh...

16:40.785 --> 16:41.786
Yeah.

16:43.220 --> 16:44.321
I'm an alcoholic.

16:45.455 --> 16:47.391
Hey Russel. Welcome.

16:50.728 --> 16:53.130
This can't be good for
people with sugar addiction.

16:53.330 --> 16:54.496
Oh, there,

16:54.498 --> 16:56.197
there's no such thing.

16:59.771 --> 17:00.703
You did,

17:00.705 --> 17:02.740
really, really well tonight,
really well.

17:03.206 --> 17:05.275
So, how, how are you feeling
about it?

17:06.443 --> 17:07.712
You know it was uhm,

17:08.880 --> 17:10.079
it was fine.

17:10.882 --> 17:12.082
Good, good.

17:12.549 --> 17:14.284
So on the, the first night.

17:14.786 --> 17:16.353
What we usually do is,

17:16.654 --> 17:18.321
link you up with a sponsor.

17:18.656 --> 17:20.255
And that's just, uh,

17:20.257 --> 17:22.223
you know, someone that you can
talk to,

17:22.224 --> 17:23.761
you know, if the need arises.

17:24.628 --> 17:26.161
And, and you're lucky,

17:26.163 --> 17:28.231
because you're getting one of
our veterans.

17:30.233 --> 17:31.234
Chip.

17:31.468 --> 17:32.469
Hey Chip!

17:33.037 --> 17:34.806
Come over and meet Russel.

17:40.745 --> 17:42.477
So Chip's been with us now

17:42.479 --> 17:44.512
for, Chip, four or five years?

17:44.514 --> 17:46.216
- Give or take. Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:46.818 --> 17:49.353
We encourage the new sponsors to
uh,

17:50.588 --> 17:51.887
go out for a cup of coffee,

17:51.889 --> 17:53.221
or even for dinner,

17:53.223 --> 17:54.857
on the first night, just to,

17:54.859 --> 17:56.626
just to get to know each other.

17:56.628 --> 17:58.428
That's of course if you've got
the time.

17:59.496 --> 18:01.298
Well, as long as it's not a bar.

18:16.213 --> 18:17.247
- Uh?
- I'm good.

18:18.950 --> 18:20.685
My whole body will explode.

18:22.319 --> 18:23.788
Can't get enough of this shit.

18:25.957 --> 18:27.157
I can see that.

18:27.892 --> 18:28.693
I have this,

18:29.192 --> 18:32.630
small collection of bottles at
home from all over the world.

18:33.698 --> 18:34.864
Cool.

18:34.866 --> 18:37.702
Breakfast, lunch, dinner,
every fucking meal you know.

18:38.136 --> 18:39.771
I'm gonna start putting this on
my...

18:40.237 --> 18:41.706
fucking Cocoa Puffs.

18:42.674 --> 18:44.809
Maybe that's
what you need AA for.

18:46.410 --> 18:47.411
Hot sauce.

18:48.512 --> 18:49.580
Funny.

18:52.315 --> 18:53.616
Seriously though, uh,

18:53.618 --> 18:55.753
as your sponsor I should tell
you to stop.

18:56.888 --> 18:58.355
It's getting out of hand.

19:00.925 --> 19:01.926
Okay.

19:02.994 --> 19:04.729
That's a lot of sauce.

19:08.966 --> 19:10.500
You, uh, you married?

19:16.674 --> 19:17.675
No.

19:18.710 --> 19:20.277
You got kids?

19:24.582 --> 19:25.583
Nah.

19:27.919 --> 19:28.920
Christ.

19:29.153 --> 19:31.221
No wonder I'm an alcoholic.

19:32.757 --> 19:33.758
No, I mean I'm,

19:36.359 --> 19:38.295
I'm married with a kid, I uh,

19:38.563 --> 19:39.831
I knocked up a girl.

19:40.898 --> 19:42.432
Way too young and now, uh.

19:42.734 --> 19:44.867
I have a wife who won't
even look at me so...

19:44.869 --> 19:45.903
Hmmm.

19:46.269 --> 19:48.606
Grass is always greener, I
guess.

19:51.475 --> 19:52.610
So what do you do?

19:55.079 --> 19:56.279
Detective.

19:57.481 --> 19:58.482
- Oh yeah?

20:00.051 --> 20:01.251
Yeah.

20:02.385 --> 20:03.753
You seem surprised, dude,

20:03.755 --> 20:04.822
what you don't believe me?

20:05.223 --> 20:06.724
Nah, you look like a,

20:07.592 --> 20:09.794
you look like every, detective
ever.

20:10.094 --> 20:11.495
Oh yeah, is that...

20:11.963 --> 20:13.495
- How?
- You just got the

20:13.497 --> 20:14.932
greasy hair and the uh,

20:15.199 --> 20:17.702
the earring, looks good, you
look good.

20:20.071 --> 20:21.304
What about you?

20:21.706 --> 20:22.707
What?

20:23.107 --> 20:24.407
- What do you do?

20:26.543 --> 20:27.544
Computers.

20:38.388 --> 20:40.457
When's the last time you had a
drink?

20:41.324 --> 20:43.360
Really just gonna jump into it
like that?

20:43.628 --> 20:46.530
It's part of the thing, part of the job.
I have to ask questions.

20:46.764 --> 20:48.697
I just got to let you
know that I ain't gonna

20:48.699 --> 20:50.534
suck your dick on the
first date alright.

20:51.301 --> 20:53.271
What like two
weeks, three weeks?

20:55.807 --> 20:57.340
It's been a few days.

20:58.508 --> 20:59.509
Oh.

20:59.944 --> 21:00.945
- Wow.
- Yeah.

21:01.478 --> 21:03.547
What's the poison of choice?

21:04.982 --> 21:05.983
Tom Collins!

21:07.517 --> 21:09.419
- That's a classic.
- Yeah.

21:12.522 --> 21:14.524
Bet you don't miss the
hangovers that's good.

21:20.497 --> 21:21.498
Well you know,

21:21.933 --> 21:23.533
as fucked up as this might
sound,

21:24.836 --> 21:25.837
I do.

21:27.839 --> 21:29.674
I miss everything about it.

21:31.676 --> 21:32.810
I miss the smell.

21:34.779 --> 21:35.780
Yeah.

21:36.346 --> 21:38.546
I miss that crisp sound it makes

21:38.548 --> 21:40.448
when you pour it over ice.

21:40.450 --> 21:42.587
And you swirl it around in your
glass.

21:43.420 --> 21:45.522
It's like hearing fucking
Christmas bells.

21:47.124 --> 21:48.125
Things

21:48.926 --> 21:50.460
immediately begin to

21:51.461 --> 21:52.462
look different,

21:53.698 --> 21:55.432
feel different, you know.

21:58.603 --> 22:00.738
It's all about that warmth.

22:03.107 --> 22:04.842
It starts from your head,

22:05.209 --> 22:07.778
and it moves right down to your
feet.

22:08.946 --> 22:10.948
And you feel warmer,

22:11.282 --> 22:13.150
and warmer until you're numb.

22:16.587 --> 22:18.187
and in one fucking second,

22:18.189 --> 22:19.688
all your problems are just.

22:22.193 --> 22:23.393
Gone.

22:30.868 --> 22:31.836
Uhm.

22:32.336 --> 22:34.071
Well, anyway it's getting late,

22:34.437 --> 22:36.107
I got a work thing, uhm.

22:38.943 --> 22:39.944
Just, uh,

22:41.145 --> 22:43.080
I gotta get out of here, uhm.

22:46.984 --> 22:49.687
Let me know when we're
gonna have our second date huh.

22:50.655 --> 22:52.154
It's good to meet you.

22:52.156 --> 22:53.891
Yeah, likewise.

23:04.969 --> 23:05.970
Chip?

23:06.370 --> 23:08.538
Dad, it's your turn!

23:10.741 --> 23:11.742
Sorry.

23:15.046 --> 23:16.714
Move backwards four.

23:19.183 --> 23:20.184
Bummer.

23:23.854 --> 23:25.890
Okay, let's see what we got
here.

23:27.024 --> 23:28.857
Oh, move forward twelve.

23:28.859 --> 23:30.795
- Not bad, huh buddy!
- Lucky!

23:36.600 --> 23:39.601
- Oh you're so close!
- So close huh?

26:32.943 --> 26:35.277
Hi you've reached the Gutchells!

26:35.279 --> 26:37.212
We're not in right now. But
leave a message

26:37.214 --> 26:40.184
at the tone and we'll get back
to you as soon as we can, thanks.

26:47.124 --> 26:48.357
Everyone listen hey!

26:48.359 --> 26:51.095
Family meeting everybody,
just listen up family meeting!

26:51.996 --> 26:54.231
So some of you heard and
some of you haven't uh...

26:54.498 --> 26:56.367
but the perseverance plaque,

26:57.034 --> 26:59.401
from last year has gone missing.

26:59.403 --> 27:00.736
Yeah.

27:00.738 --> 27:02.437
So we checked all the CCTVs,

27:02.439 --> 27:06.308
Unfortunately, there were no
cameras inside of the break room.

27:06.310 --> 27:07.411
What? What?

27:07.612 --> 27:09.680
Who the fuck would do that?

27:09.880 --> 27:11.849
Look, great question.

27:12.383 --> 27:13.384
I have no idea

27:14.285 --> 27:16.852
who would do a thing like
this, needless to say

27:16.854 --> 27:18.689
an investigation is being done.

27:18.923 --> 27:19.990
And we will get,

27:20.424 --> 27:22.224
get to the bottom of this.

27:22.226 --> 27:23.761
and uh, persevere on.

27:24.161 --> 27:24.993
Right.

27:24.995 --> 27:27.064
Because, as the plaque says,
said.

27:28.065 --> 27:29.867
That's what RTM does best.

27:30.467 --> 27:32.870
And that is what RTM is all
about.

27:33.237 --> 27:35.470
On a lighter note
this Thursday is

27:35.472 --> 27:37.474
bring your kids to work day.

27:38.509 --> 27:39.710
Got it, good.

27:41.278 --> 27:42.279
So, uhm,

27:44.181 --> 27:45.716
it's one week Russel.

27:46.116 --> 27:47.785
And everybody gets one of these.

27:48.786 --> 27:50.187
So, congratulations.

27:52.289 --> 27:53.290
Thank you.

27:56.060 --> 27:57.061
Hey, uhm,

27:57.962 --> 27:59.964
actually have you heard from
Chip at all.

28:01.365 --> 28:03.033
Actually I haven't, uhm.

28:03.901 --> 28:06.170
It felt kind of empty without
him tonight didn't it.

28:06.503 --> 28:08.205
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well.

28:09.840 --> 28:11.208
I don't want to complain or

28:11.475 --> 28:14.111
- sound like a snitch or nothing but uh,
- Okay.

28:14.579 --> 28:16.814
guy he just hasn't been
answering any of my calls.

28:18.148 --> 28:19.149
Oh.

28:21.252 --> 28:22.953
I'll try to get a hold of him
for you.

28:23.287 --> 28:24.288
I'm sure it's,

28:24.521 --> 28:25.990
probably just family stuff.

31:05.717 --> 31:08.150
Hi you've reached the Gutchells!

31:08.152 --> 31:09.752
We're not in right now. But
leave a message

31:09.754 --> 31:12.421
at the tone and we'll get
back to you as so-

31:18.529 --> 31:19.762
Hey get over here come on!

31:19.764 --> 31:22.299
So you just put it
and it calculates it for you.

31:23.133 --> 31:24.299
Pretty cool huh?

31:24.301 --> 31:25.670
I already learned that?

31:26.003 --> 31:27.371
This is so boring.

31:29.506 --> 31:30.507
Okay, I...

31:31.609 --> 31:32.775
I'm trying, I just.

31:32.777 --> 31:35.277
This is what I do for a living
so.

31:36.648 --> 31:38.581
Hey,
who wants to play hide and go seek?

31:40.350 --> 31:41.483
Go ahead.

31:41.485 --> 31:43.487
Where's the chaser at?

31:45.489 --> 31:47.424
Alright there we
go, we got a new one.

31:48.358 --> 31:49.561
Alright 30 seconds.

31:50.227 --> 31:51.228
Starting now!

32:02.239 --> 32:03.240
Fox!

32:05.309 --> 32:07.344
Yeah, decent work on the Torres
case.

32:08.145 --> 32:10.682
- Well thank you.
- I'm throwing you on something else.

32:12.049 --> 32:13.515
Fucking kidding me, I've

32:13.517 --> 32:15.618
been doing everything that
you've asked me to do.

32:15.620 --> 32:18.455
- You did! And now I'm throwing
you on to something else.

32:20.190 --> 32:21.525
With all due respect,

32:22.259 --> 32:25.126
I've been working the shit out of this
case for eight fucking months now-

32:25.128 --> 32:27.195
- We got a missing kid in
the business district!

32:27.197 --> 32:28.566
Just came in about an hour ago.

32:28.766 --> 32:29.767
Where?

32:30.234 --> 32:31.535
The RTM building.

32:32.102 --> 32:34.037
Officers already on site.

32:37.775 --> 32:38.908
Go!

32:38.910 --> 32:41.311
Okay, so apparently it's
bring your kid to work day.

32:41.779 --> 32:44.546
They're saying the kid was there
on second and then gone the next.

32:44.548 --> 32:46.316
They were playing a game of hide
and seek.

32:46.718 --> 32:47.518
Surveillance?

32:48.352 --> 32:52.189
The only two people we have on video
leaving the building in our time frame

32:52.389 --> 32:54.624
is a janitor who's been there
ten years.

32:54.626 --> 32:56.692
And a delivery guy with a
package.

32:56.694 --> 32:58.161
Both of their stories check out.

32:58.495 --> 32:59.762
And the interior?

32:59.764 --> 33:02.163
Every camera in that office has
been wiped.

33:02.165 --> 33:02.999
Huh.

33:03.001 --> 33:05.601
That assholes a sly little cat
huh.

33:05.603 --> 33:08.205
- Yeah that's what I'm saying.
- What about the parents?

33:09.072 --> 33:11.406
We have the dad detained in a
small room.

33:11.408 --> 33:13.143
He's, uh, he's not happy.

33:14.779 --> 33:16.046
Who's in charge?

33:16.648 --> 33:17.447
A Rick Mitchum.

33:18.048 --> 33:20.618
Apparently, he's the guy that
was playing games with the kids.

33:20.885 --> 33:22.319
Alright, well uh...

33:23.487 --> 33:25.253
Let's go ahead and check
him out along with

33:25.255 --> 33:26.758
every other employee
that was here today.

33:26.991 --> 33:28.191
Alright.

33:28.458 --> 33:29.725
Make it thorough.

33:29.727 --> 33:31.629
If they have late or unpaid
parking tickets

33:31.996 --> 33:33.330
I wanna know about it.

33:34.298 --> 33:36.364
Sir, for the love of God,

33:36.366 --> 33:37.700
please sit in your chair.

33:37.702 --> 33:39.102
I'm done sit in your chair.

33:39.503 --> 33:41.573
We will get to you later, all of
you.

33:42.840 --> 33:43.841
So Mr. Mitchum.

33:44.776 --> 33:46.543
Have you had any employees

33:46.978 --> 33:49.144
that have been laid off in
the past year or two,

33:49.146 --> 33:51.781
with any screws loose,
criminal history anything like that?

33:51.783 --> 33:55.885
Last person laid off here is
going around three years back.

33:55.887 --> 33:58.654
And you know that's still when
my dad ran the place.

33:58.656 --> 34:01.724
Since I've been running it nobodies
been fired- uhm that guy ended up, uh

34:01.726 --> 34:04.762
He moved up uh, Mil-Milwaukee uh
with his family

34:05.063 --> 34:06.829
They're doing well we chat
online.

34:06.831 --> 34:09.333
By the way I do a-a-a thorough

34:10.100 --> 34:13.203
a thorough uh background
check before anyone even gets

34:13.402 --> 34:15.539
you know an interview here
so that should weed out.

34:15.806 --> 34:17.174
Alright listen up.

34:17.641 --> 34:19.242
I'm gonna have to uhm,

34:20.177 --> 34:22.446
- talk to everybody that was here today.
- Yeah sure.

34:22.813 --> 34:24.512
They can arrange to have them
picked up,

34:24.514 --> 34:26.313
but no adults are leaving this
office

34:26.315 --> 34:27.317
until I'm done.

34:27.619 --> 34:28.620
Super.

34:30.320 --> 34:31.455
So no kids huh?

34:32.924 --> 34:34.291
No I'm afraid not.

34:35.860 --> 34:37.226
Is that by choice?

34:38.795 --> 34:39.797
No I...

34:42.667 --> 34:44.702
I've just been really focused on
my career.

34:45.402 --> 34:47.402
I don't think I really had time
for them.

34:47.404 --> 34:49.272
But you want them don't you.

34:51.909 --> 34:54.378
I'm not really sure what you're
trying to get at here.

34:57.347 --> 34:59.282
Do you want fucking kids or not?

35:01.719 --> 35:02.720
No.

35:03.655 --> 35:04.656
Not really.

35:21.471 --> 35:23.306
Can we keep the area clear
please?

35:24.942 --> 35:25.943
Sauna.

35:27.612 --> 35:28.613
Well.

35:28.980 --> 35:30.682
Now I know how to get a hold of
you.

35:31.716 --> 35:33.483
Yeah look I'm sorry, uh...

35:34.886 --> 35:37.387
It's been, a crazy couple of
weeks at my place.

35:37.722 --> 35:38.956
- It's...
- Oh yeah?

35:39.423 --> 35:41.291
- It's just been-
- What's been going on?

35:41.759 --> 35:42.760
Uh.

35:43.260 --> 35:45.495
My wife's, my wife's been sick.

35:45.730 --> 35:46.731
Oh.

35:48.298 --> 35:49.299
What she got?

35:49.867 --> 35:51.501
Ce-uh, cerebral palsy.

35:53.571 --> 35:55.573
Your wife has cerebral palsy?

35:56.641 --> 35:57.642
We th-no.

35:59.342 --> 36:00.510
We thought she did.

36:01.244 --> 36:03.480
Turns out she was just
feeling a little bit stiff.

36:04.182 --> 36:06.349
She's fine now
it was a false alarm so.

36:07.384 --> 36:08.385
Oh, okay.

36:09.020 --> 36:10.487
Well that's uh good.

36:11.656 --> 36:13.256
Yeah, don't worry about it.

36:15.392 --> 36:16.761
So you're really a cop huh.

36:16.961 --> 36:18.261
A detective, yes.

36:19.362 --> 36:20.965
You really are a uhm, how?

36:21.933 --> 36:24.569
How did you word your occupation
again what was it, uh?

36:25.703 --> 36:27.337
- Computers.
- Computers, yeah.

36:27.605 --> 36:29.272
I'm the IT guy around here.

36:29.741 --> 36:31.475
That, that's interesting.

36:32.810 --> 36:34.043
Cause,

36:34.045 --> 36:36.681
as soon as I was briefed on what
was going on down here the,

36:37.247 --> 36:39.382
first person that I wanted to
talk to,

36:40.051 --> 36:40.983
was,

36:40.985 --> 36:43.487
the man or woman who runs all
the tech.

36:44.989 --> 36:47.290
- Here I am.
- Yeah here you are.

36:47.792 --> 36:49.727
I mean just who would have
thought that the,

36:49.994 --> 36:53.698
the person that I wanted to talk
to most was in fact my AA sponsor.

36:55.465 --> 36:56.734
Small world.

36:57.300 --> 36:58.870
Person I should trust.

36:59.670 --> 37:02.405
Person I should be able to look
to if I'm having a problem.

37:04.008 --> 37:05.042
Guess what Chip?

37:05.610 --> 37:06.611
What?

37:07.845 --> 37:09.046
I've got a problem.

37:10.447 --> 37:12.516
I've got a big fucking problem.

37:15.418 --> 37:16.621
Okay, well,

37:16.954 --> 37:19.056
- I'm willing to help in any way that I can.
- Yeah!

37:20.758 --> 37:22.958
You keep saying that
but I have yet to witness it.

37:22.960 --> 37:25.495
But maybe now that your
wife doesn't have the uh

37:25.863 --> 37:26.931
cerebral palsy.

37:28.365 --> 37:29.801
All of that can change.

37:30.701 --> 37:33.303
See I've got a missing kid, in
an office.

37:34.038 --> 37:36.339
It's your office in fact and uh,

37:36.741 --> 37:38.908
Whoever took this kid was able
to erase

37:38.910 --> 37:40.943
him or herself doing it. Now,

37:40.945 --> 37:42.880
everyone I've talked to here
today is,

37:43.147 --> 37:44.215
pretty good with computers.

37:44.849 --> 37:48.920
You know they could draft up an invoice,
make a powerpoint and all that bullshit.

37:49.153 --> 37:50.485
But,

37:50.487 --> 37:51.488
none of them,

37:51.956 --> 37:53.490
are the computer guy.

37:54.725 --> 37:57.492
The information technology man
himself.

37:57.494 --> 37:59.063
But now here he is, it's you.

38:00.064 --> 38:01.065
Chip Gutchell.

38:03.034 --> 38:04.035
My mentor.

38:04.401 --> 38:05.603
My buddy.

38:06.671 --> 38:07.638
My pal.

38:08.538 --> 38:09.506
So,

38:10.675 --> 38:11.676
maybe,

38:12.109 --> 38:13.476
if you don't mind.

38:14.612 --> 38:17.680
You can dig deep down inside
that tech wizard mind of yours

38:17.682 --> 38:19.382
and finally help me out.

38:20.483 --> 38:21.484
Huh?

38:22.153 --> 38:24.119
- I'm not sure I understand are
you

38:24.121 --> 38:26.021
presuming I had something to do
with this,

38:26.023 --> 38:27.024
- or?
- No.

38:27.457 --> 38:28.659
No no I'm just,

38:29.927 --> 38:31.562
asking for your support.

38:35.867 --> 38:36.868
Chip.

38:39.070 --> 38:40.903
You know how to operate the

38:40.905 --> 38:41.939
CCTV do you not?

38:45.810 --> 38:46.777
Yeah.

38:48.846 --> 38:51.414
Did you alter the security
footage here today in anyway?

38:54.552 --> 38:56.087
Twelve. Thirteen.

38:56.386 --> 38:57.588
Fourteen.

38:57.989 --> 38:58.956
Fifteen.

38:59.657 --> 39:00.658
Sixteen.

39:00.992 --> 39:01.993
Seventeen.

39:02.293 --> 39:03.826
Eighteen.

39:03.828 --> 39:05.160
Nineteen and Twenty.

39:05.162 --> 39:06.463
Ten more seconds.

39:31.055 --> 39:33.456
Andrew! Andrew?

39:37.061 --> 39:38.827
Listen,
I think it's all going to be fine.

39:38.829 --> 39:40.863
Just keep looking guys,
we're RTM aren't we?

39:40.865 --> 39:42.667
Did you hide
him, find him please.

39:49.240 --> 39:50.608
Look I think it's,

39:51.008 --> 39:52.643
for everybody here, uh.

39:55.880 --> 39:57.882
I mean God forbid something
happened to this kid.

40:03.187 --> 40:06.055
I can assure you Mr. Gutchel something
bad has happened to this kid.

40:06.057 --> 40:07.058
He is missing.

40:08.025 --> 40:09.660
Right, and like I said I'm,

40:10.527 --> 40:12.527
willing to help out in anyway
that I can

40:12.529 --> 40:13.998
but right now I just uhm

40:14.598 --> 40:16.298
I gotta get my kid home to his
mom,

40:16.300 --> 40:18.501
cause I know that it could
have been my own so.

40:18.803 --> 40:19.804
Sure. Yeah.

40:21.806 --> 40:22.807
Yeah, well.

40:23.240 --> 40:24.809
I guess that wraps this up huh?

40:25.910 --> 40:27.011
See your way out.

40:28.079 --> 40:29.078
Okay. We're good?

40:29.080 --> 40:30.982
Hope I see you
at next weeks meeting.

40:32.883 --> 40:33.949
Oh, and Chip.

40:33.951 --> 40:34.952
If I uhm,

40:36.253 --> 40:38.022
try to get ahold of you for
anymore

40:38.356 --> 40:39.557
questions or,

40:40.124 --> 40:41.125
guidance.

40:42.660 --> 40:44.028
Pick up your fucking phone,
okay.

40:45.129 --> 40:46.797
- Of course.
- Alright.

41:38.182 --> 41:39.850
Come on, you son of a bitch.

42:38.809 --> 42:40.144
Hi baby, hi.

42:41.212 --> 42:42.279
Hey honey how is it going?

42:43.914 --> 42:44.915
You okay?

42:45.116 --> 42:46.117
Yeah.

42:47.251 --> 42:48.283
I missed you.

42:48.285 --> 42:49.718
He's alright.

42:49.720 --> 42:50.886
Are you sure?

42:50.888 --> 42:51.889
Yeah.

42:52.323 --> 42:53.324
Ok baby.

42:53.991 --> 42:56.193
Can you go ahead and
get ready for bed?

42:58.028 --> 42:59.029
Okay.

43:16.380 --> 43:17.813
What are you doing?

43:17.815 --> 43:19.216
Looking for your little secret.

43:24.388 --> 43:26.223
I got a call from a Nelson
Guerrera today.

43:28.092 --> 43:29.727
How long has this been going on?

43:31.095 --> 43:33.262
- Chip!
- It's not going on this was years ago.

43:33.264 --> 43:36.066
- Then why did you go for a
drink right when you walked in.

43:37.034 --> 43:38.969
I don't want
to do this right now.

43:39.236 --> 43:41.105
I really don't want to do this,
this is,

43:41.672 --> 43:43.839
It's stupid that we're
even talking about this.

43:43.841 --> 43:45.440
- Okay, you know what Chip?
- Just drop it.

43:45.442 --> 43:46.443
I'm uhm,

43:47.444 --> 43:49.244
I'm really fucking trying here,

43:49.246 --> 43:51.048
Okay, and I don't know.

43:52.016 --> 43:53.916
How I'm supposed to move
forward,

43:53.918 --> 43:55.784
if you just keep lying to me.

43:55.786 --> 43:57.154
- No.
- Chip?

43:59.056 --> 44:01.425
I don't know what you
want me to do, I uh

44:02.026 --> 44:03.994
I-I-I really, I really don't

44:04.195 --> 44:06.428
because this isn't about me
at the end of the day,

44:06.430 --> 44:07.462
this is about you!

44:07.464 --> 44:10.199
You lied to me
for the past five years!

44:10.201 --> 44:12.067
This is ridiculous,
this was years ago

44:12.069 --> 44:14.136
I don't even know why we're
still talking about this.

44:14.138 --> 44:16.371
Oh yeah years ago, okay.

44:16.373 --> 44:18.974
Yeah as in the time I found you
in the shed

44:18.976 --> 44:21.109
with a hose around your neck,
like I don't know

44:21.111 --> 44:22.377
around that time?

44:22.379 --> 44:23.380
Yeah.

44:23.948 --> 44:25.783
Right around that time.

47:43.547 --> 47:45.547
So you're
asking me to go off this theory

47:45.549 --> 47:47.282
that you got about a white
married male.

47:47.284 --> 47:48.718
Who happens to be a father,

47:48.720 --> 47:51.121
living in the suburbs of Kritika
county

47:51.422 --> 47:53.957
who also happens to be your AA
sponsor.

47:54.158 --> 47:55.325
Which I might add,

47:55.560 --> 47:57.361
has been secretly running around

47:57.662 --> 47:59.127
cramming objects,

47:59.129 --> 48:00.431
animals and children,

48:00.732 --> 48:01.932
up his asshole.

48:03.000 --> 48:04.935
Then he somehow digests them,

48:05.135 --> 48:06.970
and he does this in sprees.

48:07.371 --> 48:09.473
Almost in serial killer fashion.

48:10.441 --> 48:11.542
Is that about it?

48:15.245 --> 48:16.246
Uh huh.

48:18.215 --> 48:20.350
I'm not entirely sure about the
whole uh,

48:20.752 --> 48:22.451
digestive system part.

48:22.453 --> 48:23.454
But yeah.

48:23.788 --> 48:25.355
And it seems the more,

48:25.723 --> 48:27.090
objects this guy's

48:27.524 --> 48:28.726
putting up his ass,

48:30.394 --> 48:32.196
the stronger he's getting.

48:33.130 --> 48:34.131
That's my

48:34.531 --> 48:35.532
theory anyway.

48:40.337 --> 48:41.673
Well uh, I should ask.

48:42.339 --> 48:44.374
Has anyone else here had that
experience?

48:47.144 --> 48:48.680
Thank you, thank you, so,

48:48.979 --> 48:50.582
there you are you see,

48:51.583 --> 48:53.083
it's much more common

48:53.585 --> 48:55.052
then most of us would think.

48:56.588 --> 48:57.589
So, uhm.

49:00.792 --> 49:03.093
All of us here wan to thank you,

49:03.393 --> 49:04.495
for sharing that.

49:17.407 --> 49:18.408
So Chip!

49:21.345 --> 49:23.013
We missed you last week.

49:23.447 --> 49:25.449
Would you like to share
something with the group.

49:28.352 --> 49:29.520
Yeah, uhm,

49:31.188 --> 49:33.290
I apologize for my absence guys.

49:35.292 --> 49:37.094
I uh, it was a hell of a week
for me so.

49:40.397 --> 49:41.731
We had a situation

49:41.733 --> 49:42.734
at my job.

49:45.837 --> 49:48.505
Missing kid, I'm sure some of
you guys have heard about it.

49:51.208 --> 49:52.209
Coincidentally,

49:52.911 --> 49:55.680
Russel here is assigned to the
case so I,

49:57.381 --> 49:59.383
he came into my work and I uh,

49:59.918 --> 50:02.185
got to talk to him and see him
work.

50:02.419 --> 50:03.420
He's great.

50:03.621 --> 50:05.289
It's really interesting.

50:09.594 --> 50:10.595
And at home,

50:13.898 --> 50:15.532
I'm having trouble with my
marriage.

50:15.900 --> 50:17.100
In what way?

50:19.369 --> 50:21.305
My wife just found out about,

50:22.807 --> 50:24.207
all this, the AA,

50:27.612 --> 50:30.247
- my addiction, everything.
- You never told her about it?

50:31.816 --> 50:32.817
No.

50:35.352 --> 50:37.187
It's always easier to just,

50:37.789 --> 50:39.222
keep her out of it.

50:41.726 --> 50:42.727
Well,

50:43.393 --> 50:44.394
that's normal.

50:44.662 --> 50:45.663
That's normal.

50:47.297 --> 50:48.532
But you know...

50:49.634 --> 50:50.700
Guys!

50:50.702 --> 50:51.801
Listen.

50:51.803 --> 50:52.804
It's important,

50:53.470 --> 50:54.471
that you know,

50:55.405 --> 50:56.639
who your support system is.

50:56.641 --> 50:59.109
I mean this is one of the
first things that we teach you.

51:00.678 --> 51:01.711
I know.

51:01.713 --> 51:02.780
I know that too.

51:03.915 --> 51:06.718
And I apologize again to
everyone for uh,

51:08.518 --> 51:09.952
for not being upfront with you.

51:09.954 --> 51:11.721
And I take full responsibility
for it.

51:11.723 --> 51:13.825
- Well with the additional
stress of,

51:15.727 --> 51:16.728
have you been

51:17.829 --> 51:18.830
tempted at all

51:19.797 --> 51:20.865
to have a drink?

51:29.974 --> 51:31.174
- No.
- Good.

51:32.810 --> 51:34.378
Good. Well that's a relief.

51:35.913 --> 51:37.481
I uh...

51:38.315 --> 51:39.316
I am sure,

51:39.584 --> 51:41.586
that you are gonna work
through these problems.

51:43.320 --> 51:44.321
Thank you.

51:46.658 --> 51:47.659
So,

51:48.760 --> 51:49.761
Russel.

51:52.362 --> 51:54.297
That seems to be an
excellent segue to you.

52:01.973 --> 52:03.141
Yeah.

52:04.541 --> 52:05.542
Yeah.

52:22.259 --> 52:23.260
Uh,

52:23.695 --> 52:24.696
my wife,

52:25.029 --> 52:26.664
wants to have you over for
dinner.

52:28.733 --> 52:29.533
She's

52:29.834 --> 52:32.335
trying to get more involved
with everything so.

52:34.806 --> 52:35.807
Right now?

52:37.709 --> 52:38.710
Yeah.

52:42.312 --> 52:43.313
Yeah.

52:43.681 --> 52:44.682
Okay.

52:46.383 --> 52:47.785
It's probably not gonna be

52:48.186 --> 52:49.386
that great.

52:50.688 --> 52:52.790
Just kind of act like you
like the food alright?

52:56.694 --> 52:57.695
Follow me.

53:03.400 --> 53:04.969
How are you liking the meetings?

53:05.636 --> 53:07.535
Do you feel like it's working
for you?

53:07.537 --> 53:09.506
Well you know, uhm,

53:09.974 --> 53:11.406
I haven't had a drink.

53:11.408 --> 53:12.240
Oh.

53:12.242 --> 53:14.244
Yeah, I mean I've wanted to.

53:14.712 --> 53:17.312
On several occasions like
right now for example,

53:17.314 --> 53:18.716
but I haven't so.

53:19.183 --> 53:22.285
I'd have to say the meetings
I guess are working for me.

53:23.621 --> 53:24.722
For now at least.

53:24.922 --> 53:26.088
That's good.

53:26.090 --> 53:27.491
Good. Good yeah, uhm,

53:28.059 --> 53:30.492
Chip, seems to say the same
thing.

53:30.494 --> 53:31.694
- Is that right?
- Yeah!

53:31.696 --> 53:34.031
- He does it you know just works.
- I love it.

53:34.464 --> 53:35.530
Works wonders for him.

53:35.532 --> 53:37.869
Well you know I gotta tell
you this guy he's uh,

53:38.435 --> 53:40.370
hell of a sponsor for me.

53:41.271 --> 53:43.473
It's a hell of a man you got
yourself right here.

53:43.708 --> 53:46.309
You should see the way they treat
him at the meetings, it's like

53:46.677 --> 53:48.946
he' an old war vet or a movie
star.

53:50.447 --> 53:52.114
- I don't know about that.
- Oh!

53:52.116 --> 53:53.883
- Come on!
- Is that right?

53:53.885 --> 53:55.720
Absolutely right, he's like

53:55.953 --> 53:57.354
our own Tom Cruise.

54:05.730 --> 54:07.364
Oh my god, wow.

54:07.565 --> 54:09.901
Okay, okay, yeah, no wonder he
still goes.

54:12.804 --> 54:13.871
Yeah I know, no

54:14.605 --> 54:15.973
- no fucking wonder.
- To Tom.

54:16.974 --> 54:18.341
- To Tom.
- To Tom.

54:21.511 --> 54:22.880
You know.

54:24.615 --> 54:26.551
Russel's the real talk of the
town.

54:29.086 --> 54:30.487
He's the real hero.

54:32.623 --> 54:34.357
I mean I can't imagine what the
uh,

54:35.560 --> 54:37.327
the Lee family's going through
but,

54:38.095 --> 54:39.462
it's gotta be hell on Earth.

54:39.764 --> 54:40.896
Gosh your line of work

54:40.898 --> 54:42.332
must be so intense.

54:44.001 --> 54:45.468
How's it all coming?

54:47.672 --> 54:48.673
Uhm.

54:49.607 --> 54:50.908
Well, it's a process.

54:52.409 --> 54:53.443
But it's coming.

54:53.778 --> 54:54.745
Good.

54:56.147 --> 54:58.415
Do you have any leads
or anything?

55:00.985 --> 55:02.618
As a matter of fact,

55:02.620 --> 55:04.387
I think we're getting pretty
close.

55:04.956 --> 55:06.090
Well that's good!

55:06.324 --> 55:07.723
That's good right?

55:07.725 --> 55:09.660
- Yeah.
- So uh,

55:10.828 --> 55:12.096
how are you feeling?

55:12.395 --> 55:14.131
What do you mean?

55:14.565 --> 55:16.601
Chip told me
about the health scare.

55:17.735 --> 55:18.736
She's good.

55:20.738 --> 55:21.871
You look fine.

55:21.873 --> 55:22.972
I'm fine.

55:22.974 --> 55:25.009
- You're fine.
- Thank you.

55:26.143 --> 55:27.510
Oh, you're sweet.

55:27.945 --> 55:29.546
What about you no girlfriend?

55:30.081 --> 55:31.082
Huh?

55:32.449 --> 55:33.450
No lucky lady?

55:34.619 --> 55:35.620
Well you know,

55:36.187 --> 55:38.521
job keeps me busy, it's my first
love.

55:39.456 --> 55:40.958
You never wanted kids?

55:43.493 --> 55:44.494
Uhm.

55:46.664 --> 55:47.665
Maybe someday.

55:51.903 --> 55:53.536
- You know what?
- Hmm?

55:53.838 --> 55:55.907
I have a very cute friend.

55:56.539 --> 55:57.873
Well there we go.

55:57.875 --> 55:58.876
Tiffany?

55:59.509 --> 56:01.810
Okay, I'm sorry can't you see it

56:01.812 --> 56:03.614
Chip, Russel here and Tiffany?

56:03.915 --> 56:04.916
Yeah.

56:06.684 --> 56:08.050
I can see it, yeah.

56:08.052 --> 56:10.485
We'll have to do a double date
or something.

56:10.487 --> 56:11.921
- I'm gonna talk to her.
- Okay.

56:11.923 --> 56:13.589
Then I'm gonna have Chip let you
know.

56:13.591 --> 56:15.026
- Alright that'd be fine.
- Okay. Okay.

56:15.293 --> 56:17.159
We could go, bowling or
something.

56:17.161 --> 56:18.526
Do you bowl Russ?

56:18.528 --> 56:19.330
No.

56:19.997 --> 56:23.065
Well you know what she will actually
be at Marty's birthday party.

56:23.067 --> 56:24.166
- Oh.
- Yeah.

56:24.168 --> 56:25.200
So uhm,

56:25.202 --> 56:26.637
I mean I don't know if uh,

56:26.871 --> 56:29.838
- laser tag is your thing but,
- Well.

56:29.840 --> 56:30.875
she'll be there.

56:31.142 --> 56:32.308
So.

56:32.310 --> 56:34.677
I'll go ahead and check my
schedule see what I can do.

56:34.679 --> 56:35.680
Okay, yeah.

56:36.948 --> 56:38.749
It'll be fun.

56:40.217 --> 56:41.218
Well, uhm,

56:42.253 --> 56:45.756
I'm so sorry but I better put
that little asshole to bed.

56:47.558 --> 56:48.726
- Yeah.
- Thanks babe.

56:48.993 --> 56:49.994
Absolutely.

56:50.995 --> 56:51.996
Anytime.

56:52.263 --> 56:53.831
Thanks for the dinner.

56:54.966 --> 56:57.702
- It' delicious.
- You are so welcome.

56:59.003 --> 57:00.169
Take the bottle away.

57:00.171 --> 57:03.007
You boys better not dig into my
wine okay!

57:16.620 --> 57:18.055
That was fun.

57:18.622 --> 57:19.623
Yup.

57:20.925 --> 57:21.892
Yup.

57:26.030 --> 57:27.698
Actually, you know what?

57:28.866 --> 57:29.732
Hmm.

57:29.734 --> 57:31.635
I got this real long drive ahead
of me.

57:33.904 --> 57:35.740
I really gotta take a shit.

57:39.777 --> 57:40.778
You mind?

57:45.349 --> 57:47.785
- You gotta shit right now?
- Yeah.

57:53.124 --> 57:54.125
Alright.

57:55.026 --> 57:56.191
You sure, cause-

57:56.193 --> 57:57.261
Yeah, it's fine.

58:00.598 --> 58:01.599
Thank you.

58:07.972 --> 58:09.805
Hey I probably
should have told you

58:09.807 --> 58:11.876
but that bathroom can act
a little bit funny.

58:14.845 --> 58:16.080
I'll figure it out.

58:16.814 --> 58:19.984
Yeah, I should have had you
use the other bathroom.

58:21.752 --> 58:22.987
I'm already,

58:23.654 --> 58:24.820
halfway in.

58:24.822 --> 58:25.823
So.

58:30.895 --> 58:32.628
I think maybe we should try to,

58:32.630 --> 58:34.797
speed it up if we can. I really
gotta get to bed.

58:34.799 --> 58:36.033
I gotta be up tomorrow.

58:37.101 --> 58:38.102
Okay.

58:42.139 --> 58:44.842
Can you please
walk away from the door?

58:45.943 --> 58:46.944
Sure.

58:54.185 --> 58:55.984
What the fuck are you doing?

58:55.986 --> 58:57.953
- I think you need to come out.
- Just step,

58:57.955 --> 58:59.254
the fuck, hey, Chip.

58:59.256 --> 59:01.092
Just step away from the door
alright?

59:10.768 --> 59:11.902
Alright just open the door.

59:12.403 --> 59:13.335
Chip!

59:13.337 --> 59:16.040
Back up from the door right
fucking now!

59:55.746 --> 59:57.381
Is everything okay?

01:00:02.953 --> 01:00:03.954
Yeah, uh,

01:00:06.257 --> 01:00:07.791
door got jammed here.

01:00:10.361 --> 01:00:11.762
Sorry, to wake you.

01:00:13.097 --> 01:00:14.431
I get claustrophobic.

01:00:15.399 --> 01:00:16.400
Oh.

01:00:17.434 --> 01:00:20.738
- Thanks again for the dinner.
- Of course.

01:01:55.332 --> 01:01:56.333
Come on.

01:01:58.035 --> 01:01:59.036
Come on.

01:02:37.374 --> 01:02:39.543
Stupid fucking detective.

01:03:12.176 --> 01:03:17.247
I'm down at the power plan- ah!
The fuck!

01:03:44.408 --> 01:03:47.277
Everything that I'm telling you
is backed up on that disc.

01:03:52.015 --> 01:03:53.951
Get the fuck out of my precinct.

01:04:15.372 --> 01:04:17.274
Okay honey,
just wait right here okay.

01:04:19.009 --> 01:04:20.010
Alright.

01:04:34.091 --> 01:04:36.491
Well they said you can get out
of here in a couple of hours

01:04:36.493 --> 01:04:38.095
if you're feeling up for it.

01:04:43.601 --> 01:04:46.136
I just don't know why you had
to leave the house last night.

01:04:48.439 --> 01:04:49.440
I-

01:04:55.279 --> 01:04:57.649
Look I want everything to get
better.

01:05:00.284 --> 01:05:01.952
I want us to get better.

01:05:09.794 --> 01:05:11.729
I want you to know that I'm
done,

01:05:11.995 --> 01:05:13.197
for good.

01:05:17.769 --> 01:05:19.671
And I'm sorry for everything.

01:05:21.606 --> 01:05:22.607
Yeah me too.

01:05:51.201 --> 01:05:52.637
You shouldn't be here Russel.

01:06:01.111 --> 01:06:02.580
Do you need me to call someone?

01:06:11.756 --> 01:06:12.757
Okay.

01:07:30.568 --> 01:07:35.805
Happy Birthday

01:07:35.807 --> 01:07:37.675
dear Marty.

01:07:42.412 --> 01:07:43.815
Happy birthday

01:07:46.818 --> 01:07:47.819
to you.

01:07:59.964 --> 01:08:02.832
Happy Birthday.

01:08:02.834 --> 01:08:03.835
Happy birthday.

01:08:09.539 --> 01:08:11.743
You never wanted kids?

01:08:11.976 --> 01:08:14.779
Happy Birthday.

01:08:15.545 --> 01:08:17.881
You never wanted kids?

01:08:19.249 --> 01:08:21.151
- You got kids?
- Nah.

01:08:26.423 --> 01:08:28.291
You never wanted kids?

01:08:29.827 --> 01:08:30.828
Maybe someday.

01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:35.265
Everybody shut
up, everybody shut up!

01:08:36.968 --> 01:08:38.603
When I'm talking, thank you so
much.

01:08:38.803 --> 01:08:40.837
We have a golden rule here,
that is no running.

01:08:41.072 --> 01:08:41.904
Okay.

01:08:41.906 --> 01:08:43.537
On the count of three I want to
hear

01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:44.874
you say it: One, two, three!

01:08:44.876 --> 01:08:46.475
No running!

01:08:46.678 --> 01:08:47.810
Lovely.

01:08:47.812 --> 01:08:49.243
Second rule very important: no
cursing, no yelling.

01:08:49.246 --> 01:08:52.881
On the count of three I want to hear
you say it again: One, two, Three.

01:08:52.884 --> 01:08:54.752
No cursing! No yelling!

01:08:54.952 --> 01:08:55.953
Good.

01:08:56.386 --> 01:08:57.788
Now onto gameplay.

01:08:58.388 --> 01:08:59.691
This is your gun.

01:09:01.993 --> 01:09:02.992
And this is your vest.

01:09:02.993 --> 01:09:04.392
Okay, you're gonna have sensors
on the chest,

01:09:04.394 --> 01:09:07.830
and on the back. That's what you're
aiming for on the opposing team.

01:09:07.832 --> 01:09:09.734
Oh, one more thing you guys.

01:09:11.368 --> 01:09:12.569
Have fun out there.

01:09:13.738 --> 01:09:14.738
Have fun.

01:12:29.499 --> 01:12:30.500
Who are you?

01:12:32.703 --> 01:12:33.905
That fucking smell.

01:12:35.673 --> 01:12:37.074
You'll get used to it.

01:12:38.042 --> 01:12:39.944
You're Andrew Lee I presume.

01:12:40.378 --> 01:12:42.013
- How do you know that?

01:12:43.881 --> 01:12:45.583
- Everyone's looking for you
kid.

01:13:17.048 --> 01:13:18.716
So you're gonna answer me?

01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:20.450
Huh?

01:13:20.685 --> 01:13:22.053
Who are you?

01:13:27.825 --> 01:13:30.227
I'm the guy who's gonna get
you out of here kid.

01:13:40.805 --> 01:13:41.973
It's a fart!

01:13:44.208 --> 01:13:45.209
Run.

01:15:25.109 --> 01:15:26.610
Do you know who I am?

01:15:46.163 --> 01:15:48.032
Is that your son?

01:16:10.821 --> 01:16:12.656
What is all this?

01:16:14.725 --> 01:16:17.695
This was all the
stuff he shoved up his ass.

01:17:05.743 --> 01:17:07.912
Would you say it's better than
last week?

01:17:08.746 --> 01:17:09.914
- Oh yeah, yeah, uh.

01:17:11.182 --> 01:17:12.881
The physical therapist has been

01:17:12.883 --> 01:17:13.984
a miracle worker.

01:17:14.485 --> 01:17:16.687
- Significantly better.
- Good.

01:17:16.954 --> 01:17:18.987
Okay so on a scale of one to
ten,

01:17:18.989 --> 01:17:21.757
one being the least amount
of pain and ten the most

01:17:21.759 --> 01:17:22.993
what would you say?

01:17:25.162 --> 01:17:26.397
- Probably around a three.

01:17:26.665 --> 01:17:28.299
Great! Glad to hear it.

01:17:30.434 --> 01:17:31.735
- Okay.
- We good.

01:17:32.436 --> 01:17:35.339
Right now I'd like to do a
thorough examination.

01:17:35.873 --> 01:17:37.940
- So.
- What does that mean?

01:17:37.942 --> 01:17:40.311
Take off your pants, turn
around and face the wall.

01:17:41.045 --> 01:17:43.080
Just checking for any internal
bleeding.

01:18:01.532 --> 01:18:03.100
Dear father,

01:18:03.834 --> 01:18:06.403
thank you for this meal we
are about to eat.

01:18:07.972 --> 01:18:09.773
Thank you for keeping us safe.

01:18:10.107 --> 01:18:11.108
Alive.

01:18:11.576 --> 01:18:13.310
In this crappy situation.

01:18:14.044 --> 01:18:15.446
No pun intended.

01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:17.948
We hope one day soon

01:18:18.882 --> 01:18:20.550
you can get us out of here.

01:18:20.552 --> 01:18:22.052
Back to our warm beds

01:18:22.319 --> 01:18:23.420
and our families.

01:18:25.856 --> 01:18:27.124
Thank you Lord.

01:18:27.424 --> 01:18:28.425
Amen.

01:18:44.576 --> 01:18:47.177
Now this will only
hurt for a second alright.

01:18:47.444 --> 01:18:48.445
So.

01:18:50.281 --> 01:18:51.282
Inhale.

01:18:53.585 --> 01:18:54.785
And exhale.

01:18:56.220 --> 01:18:57.254
Colon.

01:18:58.188 --> 01:18:59.223
Colon.

01:19:03.394 --> 01:19:04.395
Dad.

01:19:07.898 --> 01:19:08.899
Dad!

01:19:25.015 --> 01:19:26.283
Stay here.

01:20:28.011 --> 01:20:30.247
Hmm,
you're pretty loose back here.

01:20:30.981 --> 01:20:31.982
Really.

01:20:32.316 --> 01:20:33.317
That's weird.

01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:38.956
Okay. I'm gonna refill your
script for the Vicodin.

01:20:40.457 --> 01:20:42.259
Take two every four hours.

01:20:44.094 --> 01:20:45.095
And, uh,

01:20:46.530 --> 01:20:48.532
let's do another round of the
antibiotic.

01:20:49.233 --> 01:20:51.335
Four in the morning with
your breakfast, okay.

01:20:52.269 --> 01:20:54.138
And, uh, that is it Mr. Hero.

01:20:55.673 --> 01:20:57.508
You call me if you have any
questions.

01:20:58.108 --> 01:21:00.110
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:21:00.377 --> 01:21:02.112
You know I gotta,

01:21:02.781 --> 01:21:05.048
come clean again with you guys.

01:21:09.453 --> 01:21:10.454
When all this

01:21:11.989 --> 01:21:13.290
went down I was, uhm,

01:21:16.493 --> 01:21:17.995
I was out of control.

01:21:19.997 --> 01:21:21.129
I would have

01:21:21.131 --> 01:21:22.199
one drink,

01:21:22.399 --> 01:21:24.435
and that would lead to another.

01:21:25.135 --> 01:21:27.637
And another and you just
fall into that spiral again.

01:21:27.639 --> 01:21:29.707
I know all of you guy know
what I'm talking about.

01:21:32.710 --> 01:21:34.111
I apologize for not

01:21:34.445 --> 01:21:36.013
being honest with you.

01:21:36.748 --> 01:21:40.150
I was ashamed, I was scared,
I was so many things.

01:21:43.487 --> 01:21:46.421
And now I look across
and see this empty seat,

01:21:46.423 --> 01:21:49.993
and I realize how minimal
my problems really were.

01:21:51.495 --> 01:21:53.565
How much worse off it
could have been for me.

01:21:55.700 --> 01:21:58.603
It's weird cause, the irony of
it all is...

01:22:00.504 --> 01:22:02.306
I have no desire to drink.

01:22:05.442 --> 01:22:07.010
At any time, you know,

01:22:07.511 --> 01:22:10.247
a very sick, sick man could
come back to get

01:22:11.548 --> 01:22:12.750
me and my family

01:22:14.752 --> 01:22:17.020
It's strange you know, I'm not,

01:22:18.556 --> 01:22:20.090
I'm no longer scared.

01:22:30.602 --> 01:22:31.603
Thank you.

01:22:37.274 --> 01:22:38.841
I would like to say a few words.

01:22:38.843 --> 01:22:40.645
I know Chip hates the spotlight
but uh,

01:22:41.044 --> 01:22:42.614
but here we stand today with,

01:22:43.447 --> 01:22:44.548
with a true hero.

01:22:45.482 --> 01:22:46.481
Who, uh,

01:22:46.483 --> 01:22:47.484
get over here.

01:22:49.353 --> 01:22:50.620
in a life or death situation,

01:22:50.622 --> 01:22:52.222
reacted with no hesitation.

01:22:52.690 --> 01:22:53.789
Did yeah?

01:22:53.791 --> 01:22:55.259
To save lives and to

01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:57.629
and to put a stop to the real
scumbags.

01:22:58.763 --> 01:22:59.764
Which is uhm,

01:23:00.264 --> 01:23:02.297
Which is more than I think
I could have ever done.

01:23:02.299 --> 01:23:03.532
And that's saying something.

01:23:04.869 --> 01:23:07.605
Well I want to say thank you

01:23:07.906 --> 01:23:09.705

01:23:13.711 --> 01:23:14.779
And uh, and uhm,

01:23:15.279 --> 01:23:17.780

Lee's leave of grievance,

01:23:17.782 --> 01:23:19.449
We have Chip at our- No.

01:23:20.250 --> 01:23:21.285

the last few weeks have
been quite strange.

01:23:41.371 --> 01:23:43.471
Through ash we will rise again!

Cause Chip just got a promotion!

01:23:45.643 --> 01:23:47.579
With Chip in charge we'll reach
the top!

01:23:47.812 --> 01:23:49.479
And RTM won't ever stop!

01:23:49.714 --> 01:23:51.614

01:24:57.982 --> 01:24:59.584

Hello.

01:25:44.327 --> 01:25:45.328
Hi.

01:25:45.963 --> 01:25:46.964
Oh my God.

01:25:47.832 --> 01:25:49.332
Hi baby, is that you?

01:25:50.802 --> 01:25:51.901
Hi honey.

01:25:51.903 --> 01:25:52.904
Chip!

01:25:54.605 --> 01:25:55.606
Chip!

01:25:56.007 --> 01:25:57.207
Oh my God!

01:25:57.642 --> 01:25:58.976
It's him, it's Rocky!

01:25:59.276 --> 01:26:00.710
- What's going on?
- Right?

01:26:00.712 --> 01:26:01.713
This is him!

01:26:02.714 --> 01:26:03.746
Oh my God!

01:26:03.748 --> 01:26:04.847
- Look at him!

01:26:04.849 --> 01:26:05.850
He came back.

01:26:06.349 --> 01:26:08.351
He remembered us and he came
back.

01:26:08.586 --> 01:26:09.587
Hi baby!

01:26:09.954 --> 01:26:11.286
Hi baby!

01:26:11.288 --> 01:26:13.390
- That's really him.
- Oh my God!

01:26:13.658 --> 01:26:16.259
Look at him, look at
the little guy he's all wet.

01:26:16.493 --> 01:26:18.528
- He's soaked.
- What happened to him!

01:27:24.461 --> 01:27:25.730
Alright kid,

01:27:26.798 --> 01:27:27.799
you're next.

01:27:31.936 --> 01:27:34.304
I'm so sorry I can't make it
today honey.

01:27:34.672 --> 01:27:35.673
It's okay.

01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:37.640
I'd rather you not be there,

01:27:37.642 --> 01:27:39.509
- I'm nervous enough as it is.
- Really?

01:27:40.578 --> 01:27:41.913
Why? You're gonna be great.

01:27:42.445 --> 01:27:44.949
- I'm not one for speeches.
- I know.

01:27:45.917 --> 01:27:47.750
You know I was thinking uhm,

01:27:47.752 --> 01:27:50.755
maybe in a couple of weekends we
could go back to Sanibel.

01:27:51.722 --> 01:27:52.788
It's so fun.

01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:54.357
We can take Marty and,

01:27:55.026 --> 01:27:58.461
what was that place we used to go
to, uhm the Cottage Inn I think.

01:27:59.130 --> 01:28:02.430
And then you know, uh there's that
Italian place we could take him there

01:28:02.432 --> 01:28:04.001
- He would love it.
- I don't really have...

01:28:04.334 --> 01:28:06.037
time for this right now.

01:28:08.005 --> 01:28:09.104
- Oh.

01:28:09.106 --> 01:28:10.471
I'm just a little,

01:28:10.473 --> 01:28:12.076
I'm just nervous you know.

01:28:12.810 --> 01:28:14.879
- Uhm yeah sure.
- What if we talk about it later?

01:28:17.414 --> 01:28:18.683
I should get going dear.

01:28:19.549 --> 01:28:20.551
Okay.

01:28:37.034 --> 01:28:38.035
Help! Help!

01:28:40.204 --> 01:28:41.739
No don't touch it!

01:28:47.078 --> 01:28:48.079
Look at me!

01:28:48.545 --> 01:28:50.081
You're gonna be fine!

01:28:58.689 --> 01:28:59.690
Welcome!

01:29:00.591 --> 01:29:02.126
Thank you all for coming.

01:29:02.593 --> 01:29:04.427
I'm Mayor Micheal Cage.

01:29:05.462 --> 01:29:06.862
And we're here today to,

01:29:06.864 --> 01:29:08.566
celebrate a true American hero.

01:29:09.667 --> 01:29:12.136
I thank our
lucky stars every single day

01:29:13.571 --> 01:29:15.706
that this man was able
to stop this monster.

01:29:16.707 --> 01:29:17.973
And I can tell ya,

01:29:17.975 --> 01:29:19.810
that we're doing everything in
our power

01:29:20.144 --> 01:29:21.145
to find him.

01:29:21.879 --> 01:29:22.880
Now.

01:29:23.247 --> 01:29:25.548
It's not often that we give out
this award.

01:29:25.950 --> 01:29:26.951
And when we do,

01:29:27.450 --> 01:29:29.820
it's usually to one of our boys
in blue.

01:29:31.255 --> 01:29:32.455
Today,

01:29:32.890 --> 01:29:34.191
we're about to make an
exception.

01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:37.595
So without further ado,

01:29:39.529 --> 01:29:42.066
Here's South Kritika Counties
own white knight

01:29:43.567 --> 01:29:44.669
Chip F. Gutchell.

01:29:59.150 --> 01:30:00.151
Wow. Whoo!

01:31:14.592 --> 01:31:15.793
What the fuck!?

01:31:34.078 --> 01:31:35.079
Oh God!

01:32:05.176 --> 01:32:06.177
Case closed.

01:32:06.710 --> 01:32:07.711
Huh?
