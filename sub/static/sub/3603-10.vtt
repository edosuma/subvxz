NARRA TOR:
Previously on Heroes.

00:03.796 --> 00:05.582
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

00:14.599 --> 00:16.931
When I get back,
we'll be together.

00:19.061 --> 00:21.803
You came here
to get control
of your life.

00:22.023 --> 00:26.107
It's another strain
of the virus. My blood's
no longer a cure.

00:26.194 --> 00:27.559
I'm going to die?

00:27.653 --> 00:30.690
Claire is the key
that could cure
the virus.

00:30.781 --> 00:32.521
I'm here to ask you
to give us Claire.

00:32.617 --> 00:35.780
You touch my daughter
and I'll kill yours.
And then I'll kill you.

00:35.870 --> 00:37.451
(GUNSHOT FIRES)

00:40.458 --> 00:42.369
Please don't let
them take me.
I'll get us home, I promise.

00:42.460 --> 00:43.745
Don't let them...
No. No!

00:45.796 --> 00:47.206
(PANTING)

00:47.798 --> 00:49.049
KENSEI: Peter?

00:50.176 --> 00:52.132
I remember everything.

00:52.803 --> 00:54.543
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

00:56.807 --> 00:59.594
You see, when | get
my ability back,
I'm gonna kill you

00:59.685 --> 01:01.061
and your sister,

01:01.145 --> 01:02.806
and I'm gonna
take it all.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.289
(MEN SHOUTING)

01:31.050 --> 01:35.009
MAN 1: He's sick! Are you
infected? Take him to
decontamination, now!

01:35.096 --> 01:37.382
Caitlin! Caitlin!

01:37.473 --> 01:40.010
Caitlin! Caitlin!

01:40.101 --> 01:41.557
Caitlin!

01:41.644 --> 01:43.180
No need to shout.

01:43.271 --> 01:45.102
Adam, lwas there.
I saw her.

01:45.189 --> 01:48.181
You haven't gone anywhere,
Peter. You were telling me
about time traveling.

01:48.276 --> 01:50.437
How you're gonna
save some girl from
some deadly virus

01:50.528 --> 01:53.019
and then you began
shouting her name.

01:53.114 --> 01:55.571
I don't know...
I was in New York City
a year from now.

01:55.658 --> 01:59.651
I saw Caitlin.
l was calling at her to
come back with me. Look.

02:01.539 --> 02:02.528
KENSEI: Impressive.

02:04.917 --> 02:06.157
lhaveto
keep trying.

02:06.252 --> 02:08.368
I can't just leave
her there to be
killed by the virus.

02:08.462 --> 02:09.963
What do you know
about this virus?

02:10.047 --> 02:13.084
I know that it kills
over 93% of the world's
population.

02:13.175 --> 02:16.212
Peter, do you know
what the virus
is called?

02:17.763 --> 02:21.676
Shanti virus.
It's what the guy at
Homeland Security called it.

02:22.351 --> 02:25.218
What? Does that mean
something to you?

02:25.313 --> 02:28.601
I knew a woman
at the Company,
Victoria Pratt.

02:30.568 --> 02:33.184
She was a biological engineer.

02:33.279 --> 02:35.691
On Valentine's Day, 1977,

02:35.781 --> 02:40.491
she recovered a deadly virus
from a sick Indian girl
named Shanti.

02:40.578 --> 02:41.943
Under Company orders,

02:42.038 --> 02:44.950
she tried to
manipulate the virus
into a weapon.

02:45.041 --> 02:47.578
I'd heard the program
had been shut down.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.954
Clearly,
I was misinformed.

02:50.046 --> 02:53.630
PETER: Those are my parents.
Linderman. Charles Deveaux.

02:53.716 --> 02:56.298
Those are
the Company founders,
Peter.

02:56.385 --> 02:58.592
The virus
is their crime.

03:01.098 --> 03:03.680
PETER: They're
responsible for this.

03:03.768 --> 03:06.054
Parents sin,
children suffer.

03:06.771 --> 03:08.557
That is Victoria.

03:10.399 --> 03:12.481
PETER: We need
to find her, Adam.

03:13.611 --> 03:17.195
We need to find her.
Make her tell us
everything that she knows.

03:17.281 --> 03:20.694
It's the only way
to stop the virus
and save Caitlin.

03:20.785 --> 03:23.618
It's the only way
we can save the world.

03:26.123 --> 03:28.159
Get the hell
out of my house.

03:28.250 --> 03:31.083
Noah Bennet was
a loyal employee
of our Company,

03:31.170 --> 03:33.877
and for many years,
true friend.

03:34.632 --> 03:36.714
I offer my deepest
condolences.

03:36.801 --> 03:38.086
(WHISPERING) Are
those my dad's ashes?

03:38.177 --> 03:39.758
You had my husband
cremated?

03:39.845 --> 03:40.834
Yes.

03:40.930 --> 03:44.297
His personnel file was
very clear as to how his
remains should be handled.

03:44.392 --> 03:45.882
What gives you
the right?

03:45.976 --> 03:50.470
We were only trying to help
Claire use her abilities
for the greater good.

03:50.564 --> 03:53.101
But Noah's aggression
forced our hand.

03:53.192 --> 03:55.478
He was trying
to protect me.

03:57.613 --> 04:01.652
In the wake
of this tragedy,
| feel it's only fair

04:01.742 --> 04:03.653
to honor Noah's wishes.

04:05.037 --> 04:08.029
You will be left
alone to lead
a normal life.

04:08.833 --> 04:10.539
My father is dead.

04:11.669 --> 04:13.500
There is no normal.

04:14.213 --> 04:16.249
I'm sorry
for your loss.

04:27.893 --> 04:30.555
SANDRA: Pack your bags.
We're leaving tonight.

04:40.865 --> 04:43.231
The next 24 hours
are critical.

04:43.325 --> 04:46.112
I want you to keep
an eye on Claire.

04:46.203 --> 04:49.240
It'd be easier without
this thing on my arm.

04:50.082 --> 04:52.073
lt itches
like a mother.

04:52.168 --> 04:55.126
And I thought
my little girl
was tough.

04:55.212 --> 05:00.297
I am, Dad, but I was shot.
And my body
doesn't heal itself.

05:00.384 --> 05:02.045
I'm sorry
you're in pain.

05:02.136 --> 05:06.300
But none of this would
have happened if you
hadn't lowered your guard.

05:06.390 --> 05:08.426
How was I supposed to know
that Bennet teamed up

05:08.517 --> 05:10.303
with West,
the flying boy?

05:10.394 --> 05:13.306
Excuses don't change
outcome, Elle.

05:13.397 --> 05:17.891
You need to accept
responsibility for what's
happened. Can you do that?

05:18.736 --> 05:20.772
Can you regain my trust?

05:24.909 --> 05:26.365
Sure, Daddy.

05:28.913 --> 05:31.074
I'll watch
the cheerleader.

05:47.598 --> 05:49.008
(GASPING)

05:57.274 --> 05:58.810
(GRUNTS)

06:01.111 --> 06:02.726
Mohinder?

06:02.821 --> 06:04.436
Take it easy.

06:05.407 --> 06:07.489
MR. BENNET:
The last thing
I remember,

06:08.953 --> 06:10.443
you were...

06:11.956 --> 06:13.321
(EXHALES)

06:13.791 --> 06:15.827
Did you shoot me?

06:15.918 --> 06:17.874
I didn't have a choice.

06:20.130 --> 06:22.212
Why am I not dead?

06:22.299 --> 06:26.633
You would have been,
if not for an infusion
of your daughter's blood.

06:27.805 --> 06:28.885
You took
Claire's blood?

06:28.973 --> 06:30.679
lt saved your life.

06:30.766 --> 06:34.054
You betrayed me.
You went after my family!

06:34.144 --> 06:37.682
You told me this Company
had to be brought down
from the inside out!

06:37.773 --> 06:39.058
Thank God I came
to my senses

06:39.149 --> 06:40.104
before I'd done
any real damage.

06:40.192 --> 06:41.398
What have you
done with Claire?

06:41.485 --> 06:44.693
Claire's at home,
grieving the loss
of her father.

06:44.780 --> 06:45.986
(GROANS)

06:48.951 --> 06:50.987
They think I'm dead.

06:51.078 --> 06:55.071
You put us on this path
with your violence,
your paranoia.

06:55.165 --> 06:57.872
You have
nobody to blame
but yourself.

06:59.670 --> 07:00.750
What are you
doing with that?

07:00.838 --> 07:04.501
Your recovery has proven
this blood has tremendous
regenerative properties.

07:04.592 --> 07:07.925
I believe it holds the key
to saving an innocent woman
from a deadly virus.

07:08.012 --> 07:10.879
That's what
this Company does.
We save lives.

07:10.973 --> 07:13.885
Everything they've
told you is a lie.

07:13.976 --> 07:16.137
The Company
made that virus.

07:16.228 --> 07:19.140
They've been
experimenting with it
for 30 years.

07:19.231 --> 07:21.347
You can't trust them,
Suresh.

07:21.859 --> 07:24.817
Get back here,
you son of a bitch!

07:41.629 --> 07:43.369
Six hundred bucks
for a comic book?

07:43.464 --> 07:44.874
ln mint condition.

07:44.965 --> 07:48.048
But that's not why
I collect them.
I just like the stories.

07:48.218 --> 07:50.129
How about this
for a story?

07:50.220 --> 07:55.556
Once upon a time we cashed
these in and lived
happily ever after. The end.

07:55.643 --> 07:59.306
Hey. lf St. Joan's
a good guy, why is she
wearing a hood?

07:59.396 --> 08:01.887
Well, every superhero
has to have
a secret identity.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.597
How else could they
live a normal life?

08:03.692 --> 08:04.932
DAMON: Who wants normal?

08:05.027 --> 08:09.111
(SCOFFS) I'd be rolling large,
letting everybody know
who I was.

08:09.198 --> 08:10.813
But if your enemies knew
who you really were,

08:10.908 --> 08:14.651
then they'd be coming
after you at home. Maybe even
take revenge on your family.

08:14.745 --> 08:16.736
That's why Clark Kent
wears those glasses.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.161
Right.

08:28.717 --> 08:30.378
NIKI: Micah.

08:30.469 --> 08:32.460
Mom! You came back!

08:32.554 --> 08:34.169
(MlCAH LAUGHS)

08:35.015 --> 08:36.425
(LAUGHS)

08:39.103 --> 08:41.344
I told you
that I would.

08:42.064 --> 08:43.554
I missed you
every day.

08:43.649 --> 08:45.935
I missed you
every minute,
every second.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.402
What's that
even smaller one?

08:47.486 --> 08:48.521
Nanosecond.

08:48.612 --> 08:49.852
I missed you
that one, too.

08:49.947 --> 08:51.483
(LAUGHING)

08:53.200 --> 08:55.111
So where were you, Mom?

08:56.286 --> 09:00.120
I went to a place
that helps people
like us when we're sick.

09:01.667 --> 09:02.873
Is it Jessica again?

09:02.960 --> 09:05.326
No. Jessica's gone.
They all are.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.132
This is about
something else.

09:09.216 --> 09:10.626
What is it?

09:14.763 --> 09:16.299
l have a virus.

09:17.266 --> 09:21.179
You don't have to worry.
I can't make you
or anybody else sick.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.015
What's going
to happen to you?

09:24.106 --> 09:26.597
Do you remember
Dr. Suresh?

09:26.692 --> 09:31.482
He's working really hard
to find me a cure. And
when he does, I'll get better.

09:32.156 --> 09:33.316
Yeah, but what
if he doesn't?

09:33.407 --> 09:34.897
(WHISPERS) He will.

09:35.826 --> 09:38.863
I am going
to get better,
Micah.

09:38.954 --> 09:42.162
We're going to
have a normal life.
I promise you.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.660
I've got something
to make you stronger.

09:48.172 --> 09:50.504
Oh, yeah?
What's that?

09:52.092 --> 09:53.252
Dad's medal.

09:53.343 --> 09:57.677
The one that the mayor
gave him for saving
that girl from the fire.

09:59.183 --> 10:00.923
It's in my backpack.

10:01.018 --> 10:03.259
NIKI: We can't waste
another nanosecond.

10:13.655 --> 10:15.111
What's wrong, bud?

10:15.199 --> 10:17.406
It's my backpack.
It's gone.

10:23.874 --> 10:26.240
It's beautiful
out here, Gabriel.

10:27.711 --> 10:28.826
Thank you.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.500
I almost feel normal.

10:32.591 --> 10:34.877
After you see
Dr. Suresh,
you will be.

10:36.720 --> 10:39.632
And then Alejandro
and I can go back home.

10:44.186 --> 10:46.768
What if Alejandro
could go home now?

10:48.649 --> 10:50.935
But I need my brother.

10:51.026 --> 10:55.486
He is the only one
who can stop me
from hurting anyone else.

10:56.615 --> 11:00.574
What if you could learn
to control your own power?

11:01.745 --> 11:04.202
l have seen
people's powers grow.

11:04.915 --> 11:07.827
Do you love
your brother enough
to let him go?

11:07.918 --> 11:09.249
Of course.

11:10.796 --> 11:12.332
It is...

11:12.422 --> 11:14.378
It's just not possible.

11:14.466 --> 11:17.754
VVeH,yoqunever
know unless you try.

11:23.642 --> 11:25.553
We should get back.

11:25.644 --> 11:27.851
You've put him
through enough, Maya.

11:27.938 --> 11:29.929
Me?
He gave up
his entire life for you,

11:30.023 --> 11:32.184
even after you
killed his wife.

11:32.276 --> 11:33.311
It was an accident.

11:33.402 --> 11:34.938
You really think
he's forgiven you?

11:35.028 --> 11:36.108
She was cheating on him.

11:36.196 --> 11:37.527
So she deserved to die?

11:37.614 --> 11:39.775
That's not what I meant...

11:40.492 --> 11:43.108
But you wanted
to kill her.
Didn't you, Maya?

11:43.203 --> 11:45.364
Stop it. Let me go.

11:45.455 --> 11:47.286
Where? Back
to your brother?

11:47.374 --> 11:48.875
He hates you.

11:48.959 --> 11:50.699
(PANTING)

11:50.794 --> 11:52.659
Don't do this.

11:52.754 --> 11:54.039
Please.

11:58.260 --> 12:02.469
If you can control your power,
no more innocent people
have to die.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.131
I can't!

Help. You're
killing me.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.229
Help me. Please.

You were right.

12:33.629 --> 12:34.960
I did it.

12:45.682 --> 12:47.673
(HIRO SPEAKING JAPANESE)

13:36.566 --> 13:38.022
I don't think
we should go in
there guns blazing.

13:38.110 --> 13:39.520
Let's just tell
Victoria the truth.

13:39.611 --> 13:41.067
Ask her straight out
where to find the virus.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.361
This woman
can't be trusted,
Peter.

13:43.448 --> 13:45.484
She worked for the Company.
She locked me up.

13:45.575 --> 13:48.612
One glance at me
up her garden path is
liable to affect her mood.

13:48.704 --> 13:50.569
Fine. I'll go alone.

13:53.083 --> 13:54.118
No.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.051
You lost?

14:12.060 --> 14:14.893
I hope not.
Looking for
Victoria Pratt.

14:14.980 --> 14:16.060
Never heard of her.

14:16.815 --> 14:18.976
You worked for the Company.

14:26.033 --> 14:29.025
In 24 hours,
the Shanti virus
is released.

14:29.119 --> 14:33.328
A year from now, 93%
of the world's
population is dead.

14:33.415 --> 14:36.532
How can anyone know
