WEBVTT

00:01.151 --> 00:03.004
THE CUSTOMER
IS NOT ALWAYS RIGHT.

00:03.004 --> 00:04.065
DON'T COME BACK, MADAME.

00:04.065 --> 00:05.086
I'D BE HAPPY
NOT TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

00:05.086 --> 00:06.127
GUYS, I MAKE EXCELLENT FOOD!

00:08.119 --> 00:11.063
I AM GOING
TO REALLY HURT SOMEBODY.

00:11.063 --> 00:13.125
MAY 10, 2013.

00:13.125 --> 00:16.019
YOU ARE BOTH  NUTS.

00:16.019 --> 00:17.150
I KNOW.

00:17.150 --> 00:19.092
MILLIONS OF VIEWERS
WERE INTRODUCED

00:19.092 --> 00:20.134
TO AMY'S BAKING COMPANY.

00:20.134 --> 00:22.056
YOU ALL!

00:22.056 --> 00:23.247
THINK THAT YOU CAN COME IN HERE
AND SAY THESE THINGS!

00:23.247 --> 00:26.040
OH, MY GOD!

00:26.040 --> 00:27.162
WHAT THEY WITNESSED...

00:27.162 --> 00:28.243
DON'T  WITH ME.

00:28.243 --> 00:30.000
YEAH, I WILL  WITH YOU.

00:30.000 --> 00:30.055
YEAH, I WILL  WITH YOU.

00:30.055 --> 00:31.136
<i>WHO THE</i>
<i>DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?</i>

00:31.136 --> 00:32.168
WAS A <i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARES</i> EPISODE

00:32.168 --> 00:33.259
UNLIKE ANY OTHER.

00:33.259 --> 00:35.221
YOU  YOURSELF!
OUT!

00:35.221 --> 00:37.133
<i>YOU, OUT!</i>

00:37.133 --> 00:39.146
A RESTAURANT AND OWNER
SO DEEP IN DENIAL...

00:39.146 --> 00:42.129
IF ANYONE TELL ME
THAT MY WIFE'S FOOD IS NO GOOD,

00:42.129 --> 00:43.240
I JUST TELL THEM
TO LEAVE THE RESTAURANT.

00:43.240 --> 00:45.193
YOU LITTLE WEENIE!
KEEP WALKING!

00:45.193 --> 00:47.075
AND SO RESISTENT TO CHANGE...

00:47.075 --> 00:48.256
THESE ARE STORE-BOUGHT,
CRAP, FROZEN RAVIOLI.

00:48.256 --> 00:50.149
THEY'RE NOT CRAP,
AND THEY'RE DELICIOUS!

00:50.149 --> 00:51.150
OH!

00:51.150 --> 00:52.211
THAT CHEF RAMSAY
DID SOMETHING...

00:52.211 --> 00:54.143
I THINK YOU'RE TOO FAR GONE.

00:54.143 --> 00:56.065
HE HAS NEVER DONE BEFORE.

00:56.065 --> 00:58.088
THE RIGHT THING FOR ME...
IS TO GET OUT OF HERE.

00:58.088 --> 01:00.000
HE WALKED OUT.
WOW.

01:00.000 --> 01:00.120
HE WALKED OUT.
WOW.

01:00.120 --> 01:02.082
AND AS SHOCKING AS THAT WAS,

01:02.082 --> 01:04.195
WHAT FOLLOWED
WAS EQUALLY AS SHOCKING.

01:04.195 --> 01:06.117
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ARE TURNING
TO SOCIAL MEDIA

01:06.117 --> 01:07.158
TO VOICE THEIR ANGER.

01:07.158 --> 01:09.181
IN THE AFTERMATH
OF THE AIRING,

01:09.181 --> 01:10.302
SOCIAL MEDIA WENT CRAZY.

01:10.302 --> 01:13.185
THERE WERE THREATS,
NASTY ONLINE MESSAGES.

01:13.185 --> 01:15.188
PEOPLE JUST
COULD NOT BELIEVE

01:15.188 --> 01:17.150
HOW THIS COUPLE TREATED
THEIR CUSTOMERS.

01:17.150 --> 01:19.192
MILLIONS WERE BLOGGING,
COMMENTING.

01:19.192 --> 01:21.145
BASICALLY CALLING THEM
BAT- CRAZY.

01:21.145 --> 01:23.127
WATCHING AND REWATCHING.

01:23.127 --> 01:24.318
EVERYONE WAS
UNDER THE CONSENSUS

01:24.318 --> 01:26.291
THAT THESE PEOPLE
WERE NOT PARTICULARLY NORMAL.

01:26.291 --> 01:27.332
THERE WERE SKITS...

01:27.332 --> 01:28.333
CHILD OF GOD!

01:28.333 --> 01:30.000
AND EVEN CARTOONS...

01:30.000 --> 01:30.175
AND EVEN CARTOONS...

01:30.175 --> 01:32.338
I HAVE ISSUES WITH CUSTOMERS
THAT ARE ONLINE BULLIES.

01:32.338 --> 01:34.270
MADE ABOUT AMY'S BAKING COMPANY.

01:34.270 --> 01:36.192
IT'S GETTING A LITTLE
BEYOND HILARIOUS.

01:36.192 --> 01:39.166
AND TO GO ALONG WITH THAT,
A MEDIA FIRESTORM.

01:39.166 --> 01:40.247
AMY'S BAKING COMPANY.

01:40.247 --> 01:41.318
NO SOUP FOR YOU!

01:43.220 --> 01:44.332
NEVER BEFORE HAS THERE BEEN

01:44.332 --> 01:46.214
A <i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARES</i>
QUITE LIKE THIS.

01:46.214 --> 01:48.186
IT WAS LIKE WATCHING
A TRAIN WRECK.

01:48.186 --> 01:50.289
THEY WERE JUST THAT CRAZY.

01:52.251 --> 01:54.323
TONIGHT, A SPECIAL EDITION
OF <i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARES.</i>

01:54.323 --> 01:56.296
HOW ARE YOU?
<i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARE?</i>

01:56.296 --> 01:57.347
YES!

01:57.347 --> 01:59.219
WHERE YOU WILL BE SHOCKED...

01:59.219 --> 02:00.000
- ARE WE BEING PUNK'D?
- AMAZED...

02:00.000 --> 02:00.280
- ARE WE BEING PUNK'D?
- AMAZED...

02:00.280 --> 02:02.293
YOU CAN PULL THE WOOL
OVER YOUR HUSBAND'S EYES,

02:02.293 --> 02:03.374
BUT YOU CAN'T DO IT TO ME.

02:03.374 --> 02:05.266
I WANT YOU TO JUST SHUT UP.

02:05.266 --> 02:06.368
AND INFORMED...

02:06.368 --> 02:08.260
HE JUST SAID, "YOU HAVE TO GO,
YOU HAVE TO GO.

02:08.260 --> 02:09.291
YOU HAVE TO GO."

02:09.291 --> 02:11.243
AS GORDON RAMSAY
TAKES YOU BACK...

02:11.243 --> 02:13.185
SEND HIM HOME!

02:13.185 --> 02:15.328
AND REVEALS UNBELIEVABLE
NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN FOOTAGE.

02:15.328 --> 02:17.190
I'M NOT AFRAID OF YOU.

02:17.190 --> 02:18.362
YOU'RE AFRAID OF THE TRUTH,
NOT ME--THE TRUTH!

02:18.362 --> 02:21.195
THE SAD THING IS YOU DON'T
KNOW THE TRUTH.

02:21.195 --> 02:22.326
YOU'LL SEE THE HIGHLIGHTS

02:22.326 --> 02:24.348
OF SOME OF THE PUBLIC'S
WILD REACTION.

02:24.348 --> 02:26.261
IT WAS
JUST THE CRAZIEST THING.

02:26.261 --> 02:27.362
YOU'LL ALSO FIND OUT

02:27.362 --> 02:29.254
WHAT HAPPENED
TO AMY'S BAKING COMPANY

02:29.254 --> 02:30.000
IN THE LAST YEAR.

02:30.000 --> 02:30.406
IN THE LAST YEAR.

02:30.406 --> 02:33.269
THEY'RE TRYING TO CASH IN
ON THEIR NOTORIETY.

02:33.269 --> 02:36.302
AND YOU WILL GET TO HEAR
FROM SAMY AND AMY THEMSELVES...

02:36.302 --> 02:38.185
IT'S LIKE DISNEYLAND
FOR THE CRAZIES.

02:38.185 --> 02:40.247
IN A SPECIAL
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW.

02:40.247 --> 02:41.368
MY WIFE'S FOOD IS EXCELLENT.

02:41.368 --> 02:44.262
THAT'S ALL COMING YOUR WAY
TONIGHT

02:44.262 --> 02:46.224
ON A SPECIAL EDITION
OF <i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARES.</i>

02:46.224 --> 02:49.338
WE HAVE TO SHOW THE WORLD WHAT
WE REALLY HAVE TO OFFER HERE

02:49.338 --> 02:52.261
AT AMY'S BAKING COMPANY,
AND THAT'S IT!

02:54.394 --> 02:56.206
WHAT IS THAT?

02:56.206 --> 02:57.377
YOU'RE SERVING ROTTEN FOOD.

02:57.377 --> 02:58.408
THEY'RE NOT CRAP.
THEY'RE DELICIOUS.

02:58.408 --> 03:00.000
THEN WAKE UP!
YOU WAKE UP!

03:00.000 --> 03:01.292
THEN WAKE UP!
YOU WAKE UP!

03:01.292 --> 03:02.313
SHUT THE PLACE DOWN.

03:02.313 --> 03:03.294
GET OUT OF HERE!

03:03.294 --> 03:05.296
<i>THAT IS AMAZING.</i>

03:05.296 --> 03:07.329
THAT'S EMBARRASSING!
OH, GOD!

03:07.329 --> 03:09.331
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

03:13.446 --> 03:16.349
GOOD EVENING, AND WELCOME
TO A VERY SPECIAL EDITION

03:16.349 --> 03:17.440
OF <i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARES.</i>

03:17.440 --> 03:19.303
LAST YEAR,
SOMETHING HAPPENED

03:19.303 --> 03:20.344
THAT SHOCKED ME
AND MILLIONS OF YOU

03:20.344 --> 03:21.445
WHEN I TRIED TO HELP
A RESTAURANT

03:21.445 --> 03:23.367
IN SCOTTSDALE, ARIZONA.

03:23.367 --> 03:25.450
I WAS FORCED TO DO SOMETHING
I'VE NEVER DONE--

03:25.450 --> 03:27.332
WALK AWAY.

03:27.332 --> 03:28.433
I WENT TO AMY'S BAKING COMPANY
TO HELP,

03:28.433 --> 03:30.000
BUT THE OWNERS WERE INCAPABLE
OF LISTENING.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.277
BUT THE OWNERS WERE INCAPABLE
OF LISTENING.

03:31.277 --> 03:33.349
THERE WAS SUCH A STRONG REACTION
TO THE EPISODE

03:33.349 --> 03:35.271
THAT WE DECIDED
TO GIVE YOU AN UPDATE

03:35.271 --> 03:36.333
ON WHAT'S HAPPENED SINCE.

03:36.333 --> 03:37.484
WE'LL ALSO SHOW YOU
SOME FOOTAGE

03:37.484 --> 03:39.356
THAT HAS NEVER
BEEN SEEN BEFORE,

03:39.356 --> 03:41.438
AND WE'LL HEAR
FROM AMY AND SAMY THEMSELVES.

03:41.438 --> 03:45.263
BUT FIRST, A BRIEF REMINDER
OF MY WILD JOURNEY

03:45.263 --> 03:47.415
AT AMY'S BAKING COMPANY.

03:47.415 --> 03:50.379
IT WAS MY FIRST TIME
IN SCOTTSDALE, ARIZONA,

03:50.379 --> 03:52.381
AND I WAS REALLY
LOOKING FORWARD

03:52.381 --> 03:53.503
TO HELPING
THE HUSBAND-AND-WIFE TEAM

03:53.503 --> 03:55.415
OF SAMY AND AMY
WITH THEIR RESTAURANT,

03:55.415 --> 03:58.378
AMY'S BAKING COMPANY.

03:58.378 --> 04:00.000
JUST GIVE ME THE PEAR SALAD,
DARLING, IF YOU CAN.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.401
JUST GIVE ME THE PEAR SALAD,
DARLING, IF YOU CAN.

04:00.401 --> 04:01.512
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

04:01.512 --> 04:04.415
SINCE 2007,
AMY HAD RUN THE KITCHEN...

04:04.415 --> 04:07.349
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
THIS WHOLE SUBSTITUTION THING.

04:07.349 --> 04:09.291
AND SAMY WAS IN CHARGE
OF THE FRONT OF HOUSE.

04:09.291 --> 04:10.412
4-C.

04:10.412 --> 04:11.484
THE OWNERS FELT
THAT THEIR FOOD

04:11.484 --> 04:13.416
WASN'T EVEN AN ISSUE.

04:13.416 --> 04:15.488
IF ANYONE TELL ME
THAT MY WIFE'S FOOD IS NO GOOD,

04:15.488 --> 04:17.350
I JUST TELL THEM
TO LEAVE THE RESTAURANT.

04:17.350 --> 04:18.502
THEY WERE LOOKING
FROM VALIDATION FROM ME

04:18.502 --> 04:21.335
THAT EVERYTHING THEY WERE DOING
WAS RIGHT.

04:21.335 --> 04:23.407
CHEF RAMSAY IS COMING
TO TELL THE PEOPLE

04:23.407 --> 04:24.519
HOW THE FOOD IS GOOD HERE.

04:24.519 --> 04:27.372
IN THE PAST,
THEY HAD AN ONGOING WAR

04:27.372 --> 04:29.435
WITH ONLINE BLOGGERS
AND CUSTOMERS

04:29.435 --> 04:30.000
WHO WERE WRITING
NEGATIVE REVIEWS.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.397
WHO WERE WRITING
NEGATIVE REVIEWS.

04:31.397 --> 04:33.439
THESE REVIEWERS
AND THESE BLOGGERS

04:33.439 --> 04:35.371
DECIDED TO MAKE UP LIES

04:35.371 --> 04:36.503
AND SAY THAT THEY ATE THE FOOD
AND IT WAS DISGUSTING.

04:36.503 --> 04:40.337
AMY AND SAMY FELT
THAT THEY WERE UNDER ATTACK,

04:40.337 --> 04:42.450
AND THAT WAS THE MAIN REASON WHY
THEIR BUSINESS WAS IN TROUBLE.

04:42.450 --> 04:44.422
THE CUSTOMER
IS NOT ALWAYS RIGHT.

04:44.422 --> 04:46.434
BEFORE I ARRIVED,
THE CAMERAS WERE THERE

04:46.434 --> 04:49.388
TO DOCUMENT DINNER SERVICE
AT AMY'S BAKING COMPANY.

04:49.388 --> 04:52.351
CAN YOU MAKE ME PEAR SALAD
INSTEAD OF THAT CAESAR?

04:52.351 --> 04:53.453
SERIOUSLY?

04:53.453 --> 04:54.524
MANY OF THE DINERS
WERE SO FRUSTRATED

04:54.524 --> 04:56.436
BECAUSE
OF THE LONG WAIT TIMES...

04:56.436 --> 04:59.389
NEVER WAITED THIS LONG
FOR ONE PIZZA.

04:59.389 --> 05:00.000
WHILE THE ONES
THAT DID HAVE FOOD...

05:00.000 --> 05:00.511
WHILE THE ONES
THAT DID HAVE FOOD...

05:00.511 --> 05:02.413
THIS REALLY JUST ISN'T GOOD.

05:02.413 --> 05:05.366
WERE TRULY DISAPPOINTED
WITH WHAT THEY WERE GETTING.

05:05.366 --> 05:06.438
I'LL TAKE IT.

05:06.438 --> 05:07.529
BUT DURING THE COURSE
OF THE EVENING,

05:07.529 --> 05:10.452
SAMY AND AMY HAD
A REALLY HARD TIME

05:10.452 --> 05:12.405
DEALING WITH ANY NEGATIVITY
FROM CUSTOMERS.

05:12.405 --> 05:13.506
<i>YOUR PIZZA'S NOT COOKED ENOUGH.</i>

05:13.506 --> 05:15.478
PUT IT AGAIN IN THE OVEN.

05:15.478 --> 05:18.392
SURE, I'LL BURN IT.

05:18.392 --> 05:20.484
IT BECAME CLEAR,
THAT AT THIS RESTAURANT...

05:20.484 --> 05:22.426
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM
WITH IT?

05:22.426 --> 05:24.429
THE CUSTOMER
ISN'T ALWAYS RIGHT.

05:24.429 --> 05:25.480
EGG IS...
IT'S TOO EGG-Y.

05:25.480 --> 05:27.472
OKAY, IF YOU CAME
TO EAT TO ENJOY,

05:27.472 --> 05:30.000
THEN YOU SHOULD KNOW
WHAT YOU LIKE TO EAT, SIR.

05:30.000 --> 05:30.476
THEN YOU SHOULD KNOW
WHAT YOU LIKE TO EAT, SIR.

05:30.476 --> 05:31.617
AND THERE WAS
ONE PARTICULAR SITUATION

05:31.617 --> 05:34.520
THAT MY CREW HAS NEVER WITNESSED
IN THE SEVEN YEARS

05:34.520 --> 05:36.423
OF DOING <i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARES.</i>

05:36.423 --> 05:37.554
WE WERE WAITING
ON ONE PIZZA.

05:37.554 --> 05:39.456
IT'S COMING NOW,
IT'S COMING NOW, NOW.

05:39.456 --> 05:40.507
YOU KEEP SAYING THAT.

05:40.507 --> 05:41.539
YOU'VE BEEN SAYING THAT
FOR AN HOUR.

05:41.539 --> 05:43.471
LOOK AT HIM,
HE'S LIKE, "WHERE'S MY PIZZA?"

05:43.471 --> 05:44.482
REALLY?

05:44.482 --> 05:45.603
SEND HIM HOME!

05:45.603 --> 05:47.456
YOU WANT TO WAIT,
YOU WAIT.

05:47.456 --> 05:48.497
YOU DON'T WANT,
PAY WHAT DID YOU HAVE,

05:48.497 --> 05:50.419
AND YOU  FROM HERE,
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

05:50.419 --> 05:51.510
SAMY.

05:51.510 --> 05:53.413
- GET OUT, YOU!
- ARE YOU  KIDDING ME?

05:53.413 --> 05:54.574
YOU, OUT!
DON'T SPEAK LIKE THIS!

05:54.574 --> 05:55.645
- GO OUT!
- ARE YOU  KIDDING ME?

05:55.645 --> 05:57.527
YOU PAY AND GO!

05:57.527 --> 05:59.430
PAY FOR WHAT?
I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING!

05:59.430 --> 06:00.000
<i>STOP! STOP! YOU HAD DRINKS.</i>

06:00.000 --> 06:00.521
<i>STOP! STOP! YOU HAD DRINKS.</i>

06:00.521 --> 06:02.563
ARE THEY FOR REAL?

06:02.563 --> 06:04.475
YOU PAY.
YOU DON'T GO.

06:04.475 --> 06:06.538
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
- YOU--IF YOU TOUCH, I!

06:06.538 --> 06:08.480
OH, MY GOD.
<i>YOU DON'T THROW ME OUT,</i>
<i>I TOLD YOU.</i>

06:08.480 --> 06:09.601
- YOU GO!
- YOU!

06:09.601 --> 06:11.464
- DON'T TOUCH ME.
- YOU!

06:11.464 --> 06:12.545
ARE YOU KIDDING ME
RIGHT NOW?

06:12.545 --> 06:13.556
YOU!
NOT KIDDING YOU.

06:13.556 --> 06:14.597
YOU!

06:14.597 --> 06:15.669
CALL THE POLICE!
I SAW--

06:15.669 --> 06:17.601
TAKE THE MONEY.
NO, I WANT THE MONEY FROM HIM.

06:17.601 --> 06:19.493
<i>I AM CALLING THE POLICE,</i>
<i>YOU GUYS ARE  CRAZY.</i>

06:19.493 --> 06:20.614
NO, STOP CALLING THE POLICE.

06:20.614 --> 06:22.486
<i>I KNOW, BUT YOU'RE NOT</i>
<i>TOUCHING HIM, GET AWAY.</i>

06:22.486 --> 06:23.538
LITTLE PANSY.
GET OUT OF HERE.

06:23.538 --> 06:24.559
AMY!
DON'T YOU EVER
COME BACK HERE.

06:24.559 --> 06:26.531
YOU LITTLE WEENIE!
KEEP WALKING!

06:26.531 --> 06:28.554
YOU!
GIVE ME A BREAK!

06:28.554 --> 06:30.000
MY TEAM GAVE ME LITTLE DETAIL

06:30.000 --> 06:30.536
MY TEAM GAVE ME LITTLE DETAIL

06:30.536 --> 06:33.549
BUT TOLD ME THAT IT WAS
A ROUGH NIGHT AT THE RESTAURANT.

06:33.549 --> 06:35.552
THIS IS RIDICULOUS!

06:35.552 --> 06:37.534
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
LIKE THIS BEFORE.

06:37.534 --> 06:41.549
BUT AS ALWAYS, I WANTED
TO FORM MY OWN OPINIONS.

06:41.549 --> 06:43.471
WHEN I ARRIVED,

06:43.471 --> 06:45.573
I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED
AT THE NICE DECOR,

06:45.573 --> 06:46.695
HOW CLEAN THE KTICHEN WAS,

06:46.695 --> 06:50.559
AND HOW WELL-ORGANIZED
EVERYTHING SEEMED TO BE.

06:50.559 --> 06:51.681
<i>IS THIS A JOKE?</i>

06:51.681 --> 06:53.603
I MEAN, LOOK,
DATES, LABELS...

06:53.603 --> 06:55.585
<i>YES, EVERYTHING.</i>
<i>SECTIONED OFF.</i>

06:55.585 --> 06:57.617
I EVEN SAMPLED
A PRETTY GOOD DESSERT.

06:57.617 --> 06:58.679
THAT'S LOVELY.

06:58.679 --> 07:00.000
LITTLE DID I KNOW,
AT THAT TIME,

07:00.000 --> 07:00.621
LITTLE DID I KNOW,
AT THAT TIME,

07:00.621 --> 07:03.635
THIS WASN'T GOING TO BE
A PIECE OF CAKE.

07:03.635 --> 07:05.577
IF ALL YOUR FOOD IS AS GOOD
AS THIS DESSERT, TRUST ME...

07:05.577 --> 07:06.608
IT IS GOOD.

07:06.608 --> 07:08.660
THERE'S SOMETHING...
NOT QUITE RIGHT HERE.

07:08.660 --> 07:11.614
DURING MY LUNCH,
THINGS STARTED TO UNRAVEL.

07:11.614 --> 07:12.675
WHAT?

07:12.675 --> 07:14.537
FIRST, I WAS SHOCKED

07:14.537 --> 07:15.629
TO LEARN MY WAITRESS MIRANDA

07:15.629 --> 07:16.600
DIDN'T MAKE ANY TIPS.

07:16.600 --> 07:17.671
SO WHERE DO THE TIPS GO?

07:17.671 --> 07:19.733
THE OWNER.

07:19.733 --> 07:21.636
<i>WHAT?</i>

07:21.636 --> 07:22.727
YEAH.

07:22.727 --> 07:24.639
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT.

07:24.639 --> 07:26.561
I KNOW.
I TRY...

07:26.561 --> 07:27.592
TO TELL HIM.

07:27.592 --> 07:28.684
WOW.

07:28.684 --> 07:29.745
OKAY, GREAT.
THANK YOU.

07:29.745 --> 07:30.000
YOU'RE WELCOME.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.618
YOU'RE WELCOME.

07:32.618 --> 07:33.640
SAMY.

07:37.734 --> 07:40.638
WE SPOKE EARLIER
ABOUT THE PROBLEM WITH STAFF...

07:40.638 --> 07:43.661
YET I'VE JUST FOUND OUT
SOMETHING PRETTY MAJOR.

07:43.661 --> 07:45.694
MIRANDA, THE YOUNG GIRL...
YEAH.

07:45.694 --> 07:47.696
YOU DON'T GIVE HER
HER TIPS.

07:47.696 --> 07:49.668
NO.

07:49.668 --> 07:52.652
SAMY, YOU CANNOT TAKE
SERVERS' TIPS.

07:52.652 --> 07:55.675
THEN BRING ME THE PEOPLE
WHO'S GOING TO DO THEIR JOB

07:55.675 --> 07:56.767
AND I DON'T HAVE
TO INTERFERE,

07:56.767 --> 07:58.649
THEY CAN TAKE
THE WHOLE TIPS FOR THEM.

07:58.649 --> 07:59.770
DID YOU SEE?
I ALREADY TOOK...

07:59.770 --> 08:00.000
THREE ORDERS BY MYSELF
AND SEND THEM ALREADY TO THE--

08:00.000 --> 08:02.703
THREE ORDERS BY MYSELF
AND SEND THEM ALREADY TO THE--

08:02.703 --> 08:04.566
YOU'RE THE OWNER.

08:04.566 --> 08:05.767
I'M DOING
THE MOST OF THE JOB.

08:05.767 --> 08:07.779
I WAS TOTALLY APPALLED.

08:07.779 --> 08:09.642
WOW.

08:09.642 --> 08:10.773
THEN I WAITED FOREVER
FOR MY FOOD.

08:10.773 --> 08:12.665
I'M GONNA START
EATING MY TICKET.

08:12.665 --> 08:13.786
I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WAITING.

08:13.786 --> 08:15.679
WHEN IT FINALLY ARRIVED...

08:15.679 --> 08:16.710
IT'S JUST A MESS.

08:16.710 --> 08:18.582
IT WAS A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT.

08:18.582 --> 08:19.673
<i>DO YOU WANT ME TO TAKE THAT?</i>
<i>PLEASE.</i>

08:19.673 --> 08:21.616
OKAY.
BECAUSE IT IS...

08:21.616 --> 08:22.697
LIKE EATING DRY CAT FOOD.

08:22.697 --> 08:23.818
AND EVEN THOUGH
I LET SAMY KNOW

08:23.818 --> 08:25.770
THE MAJOR PROBLEMS
WITH THE FOOD...

08:25.770 --> 08:27.813
THAT FILLING IS RAW!
IT'S DOUGHY.

08:27.813 --> 08:30.000
HE CHOSE NOT TO PASS ANYTHING
ON TO AMY.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.607
HE CHOSE NOT TO PASS ANYTHING
ON TO AMY.

08:31.607 --> 08:32.729
WHAT'S WRONG?
NOTHING.

08:32.729 --> 08:34.641
ACCORDING TO SAMY,

08:34.641 --> 08:35.772
HIS WIFE HAD AN ISSUE
WITH CRITICISM.

08:35.772 --> 08:37.694
I KNOW MY WIFE.
SHE GET NERVOUS.

08:37.694 --> 08:38.736
YOU'RE SCARED
OF TELLING HER THE TRUTH?

08:38.736 --> 08:40.788
YOU WANT TO TELL HER?
COME WITH ME, YOU TELL HER.

08:40.788 --> 08:42.780
I JUST WANT HER TO KNOW
SO SHE CHECKS THE NEXT ONE.

08:42.780 --> 08:44.692
OKAY, SHE WILL KNOW, YES.
SHE WILL KNOW.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.695
RIGHT. ANYWAY...

08:46.695 --> 08:48.727
I AM 75 MINUTES IN,

08:48.727 --> 08:50.800
AND SO FAR I'VE HAD
AN UNDERCOOKED PIZZA.

08:50.800 --> 08:53.683
OH, OKAY, I'M GOING TO TELL HER
YOU'RE STARVING.

08:53.683 --> 08:54.834
I'M GOING TO TELL HER
YOU ARE STARVING, OKAY.

08:54.834 --> 08:57.708
<i>SHE'LL MOVE, OKAY?</i>
<i>I HOPE SO.</i>
SHE'LL MOVE. OH.

08:57.708 --> 09:00.000
BUT HOURS LATER,
AT THE START OF DINNER SERVICE,

09:00.000 --> 09:00.761
BUT HOURS LATER,
AT THE START OF DINNER SERVICE,

09:00.761 --> 09:01.802
AMY WAS COMPLAINING

09:01.802 --> 09:03.775
THAT SHE HAD NOT RECEIVED
ANY FEEDBACK

09:03.775 --> 09:04.826
FROM WHAT I EXPERIENCED
AT LUNCH.

09:04.826 --> 09:07.729
SO I DECIDED TO TELL HER
THE BRUTAL TRUTH.

09:07.729 --> 09:08.851
THESE ARE STORE-BOUGHT...
<i>I UNDERSTAND THAT.</i>

09:08.851 --> 09:10.693
CRAP, FROZEN RAVIOLI.

09:10.693 --> 09:11.764
THEY'RE NOT CRAP
AND THEY'RE DELICIOUS.

09:11.764 --> 09:12.745
AND I--
OH! OH, MY GOD.

09:12.745 --> 09:13.836
<i>THE FIRST TIME I'VE EVER--OKAY.</i>

09:13.836 --> 09:15.739
DID YOU TASTE IT?
YOU DIDN'T TASTE THAT ONE.

09:15.739 --> 09:16.760
AGAIN, 'CAUSE YOU DIDN'T
GET THE FEEDBACK,

09:16.760 --> 09:17.851
I SAID THEY WERE DISGUSTING.

09:17.851 --> 09:19.773
BUT RIGHT FROM THE START,

09:19.773 --> 09:21.876
SHE DIDN'T CONSIDER ANYTHING
I WAS SAYING AS CONSTRUCTIVE.

09:21.876 --> 09:23.758
I'VE NEVER HAD
A PROBLEM WITH IT.

09:23.758 --> 09:24.869
OH, MY GOD!

09:24.869 --> 09:26.892
I TRIED AGAIN AND AGAIN
TO POINT OUT THE ISSUES.

09:26.892 --> 09:29.875
THE BUN FOR THE BEEF BURGER
WAS SOGGY AS ANYTHING.

09:29.875 --> 09:30.000
I HAVE NEVER HAD
A PROBLEM WITH THAT HAMBURGER.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.799
I HAVE NEVER HAD
A PROBLEM WITH THAT HAMBURGER.

09:32.799 --> 09:33.850
EVER.

09:33.850 --> 09:35.722
BUT EVERYTHING
WAS EITHER DEFLECTED...

09:35.722 --> 09:36.833
THAT WAS DRY.
IT'S GOOD LIKE THAT.

09:36.833 --> 09:38.706
OR IGNORED.

09:38.706 --> 09:39.767
<i>THERE'S NOT POINT IN ME</i>
<i>SAYING ANYTHING TO YOU</i>

09:39.767 --> 09:40.848
BECAUSE YOU'RE SO,
"WELL, IT'S GOOD LIKE THAT."

09:40.848 --> 09:42.690
WHATEVER.

09:42.690 --> 09:43.801
I FELT SO FRUSTRATED.

09:43.801 --> 09:45.824
AT THIS POINT
I WENT INTO THE DINING ROOM

09:45.824 --> 09:47.796
AND HIT ANOTHER WALL

09:47.796 --> 09:49.778
WHEN I TRIED TO CONFRONT SAMY
ABOUT THE TIPS.

09:49.778 --> 09:51.731
<i>DO YOU THINK THE GIRL DESERVE</i>
<i>SOME TIPS TONIGHT?</i>

09:51.731 --> 09:52.772
NO, THEY GET HOURLY.

09:52.772 --> 09:54.884
SIR, THE TIP THAT YOU LEFT
THE YOUNG LADY SERVER--

09:54.884 --> 09:56.757
THE OWNER TAKES THE TIPS.

09:56.757 --> 09:57.758
THAT'S HORRIBLE.

09:57.758 --> 09:58.799
NO, NO, NO, NO. OKAY.

09:58.799 --> 09:59.790
DON'T  WITH ME.

09:59.790 --> 10:00.000
YEAH, I WILL
WITH YOU.

10:00.000 --> 10:00.841
YEAH, I WILL
WITH YOU.

10:00.841 --> 10:02.754
<i>WHO THE</i>
<i>YOU THINK YOU ARE?</i>

10:02.754 --> 10:03.785
COMPLETE.

10:03.785 --> 10:04.936
THAT NIGHT, ONCE AGAIN,

10:04.936 --> 10:06.818
THERE WERE A NUMBER OF ISSUES
WITH THE FOOD,

10:06.818 --> 10:08.801
AND THERE WERE
LONG WAIT TIMES AS WELL.

10:08.801 --> 10:10.733
ARE YOU STILL WAITING
ON SOMETHING?
YEAH.

10:10.733 --> 10:11.784
WHAT IS IT
THAT YOU'RE WAITING ON?

10:11.784 --> 10:12.845
SHE GOT PASTA.
YEAH.

10:12.845 --> 10:13.857
THE SWEET AND SPICY PASTA.
THE PASTA RUSTICA?

10:13.857 --> 10:15.739
YEAH.
IS THAT COMING?

10:15.739 --> 10:17.751
THEN TOWARDS THE END
OF SERVICE,

10:17.751 --> 10:18.832
A FOOD RUNNER NAMED KATY

10:18.832 --> 10:20.765
ASKED AMY A QUESTION...

10:20.765 --> 10:21.806
<i>4-B. NO, NO, 5-B.</i>

10:21.806 --> 10:22.857
ARE YOU SURE?

10:22.857 --> 10:23.948
AND AMY LOST IT.

10:23.948 --> 10:25.750
YOU DON'T NEED
TO QUESTION ME, KATY.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.863
YOU CAN GO HOME
RIGHT NOW.

10:27.863 --> 10:29.925
KATY! LISTEN TO ME
WHEN I'M SPEAKING TO YOU!

10:29.925 --> 10:30.000
DO NOT WALK AWAY FROM ME.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.767
DO NOT WALK AWAY FROM ME.

10:31.767 --> 10:32.849
<i>YOU DON'T WORK HERE</i>
<i>ANYMORE, OKAY?</i>

10:32.849 --> 10:34.741
<i>DON'T START CRYING.</i>

10:34.741 --> 10:35.852
DON'T CRY, NO, PLEASE.
WHY ARE YOU BEHAVING LIKE THIS?

10:35.852 --> 10:36.873
NO, NO, NO, NO.
<i>OH, MY GOD!</i>

10:36.873 --> 10:37.945
PLEASE, COME ON, COME ON.
SINCE...

10:37.945 --> 10:39.857
I WASN'T DOING ANYTHING.

10:39.857 --> 10:40.908
SHE'S A KID, AMY!

10:40.908 --> 10:42.860
I WASN'T DOING ANYTHING!

10:42.860 --> 10:43.922
<i>YOU'VE HAD AN ATTITUDE WITH ME</i>
<i>ALL NIGHT LONG, KATY.</i>

10:43.922 --> 10:45.874
DON'T WORRY, PLEASE.
OKAY, I QUIT.

10:45.874 --> 10:46.895
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
I QUIT!

10:46.895 --> 10:48.827
SHE IS QUITTING.
SHE HAS AN ATTITUDE.
<i>I QUIT!</i>

10:49.919 --> 10:51.911
AFTER A REALLY BIZARRE
DINNER SERVICE,

10:51.911 --> 10:53.763
I TRIED AGAIN TO HAVE

10:53.763 --> 10:54.945
A MEANINGFUL CONVERSATION
WITH AMY.

10:54.945 --> 10:57.878
IT'S BECOME EVIDENT
THAT YOU CAN'T TAKE CRITICISM.

10:57.878 --> 11:00.000
BUT AMY REMAINED IN DENIAL...

11:00.000 --> 11:00.000
WHAT I DO NORMALLY
IS GOOD.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.963
WHAT I DO NORMALLY
IS GOOD.

11:01.963 --> 11:04.886
REFUSING TO LISTEN
TO ANYTHING I HAD TO SAY.

11:04.886 --> 11:06.989
IN YOUR FREEZER IS STORE-BOUGHT
RAVIOLIS.

11:06.989 --> 11:08.951
THE SAUCE IS DELICIOUS.

11:08.951 --> 11:11.874
THE RAVIOLIS,
WE THINK THAT THEY'RE VERY GOOD.

11:12.956 --> 11:14.898
EVEN AFTER A FRUSTRATING DAY,

11:14.898 --> 11:16.840
I REMAINED COMMITED
TO HELPING THE RESTAURANT.

11:16.840 --> 11:19.804
SO THE NEXT MORNING
I CAME IN WITH A PLAN

11:19.804 --> 11:21.906
TO TURN AMY'S BAKING COMPANY
AROUND.

11:21.906 --> 11:23.978
OH, COME ON.

11:23.978 --> 11:25.931
BUT THEY WEREN'T THERE.

11:25.931 --> 11:29.905
SO I SPENT THE MORNING TALKING
WITH DISGRUNTLED PAST EMPLOYEES.

11:29.905 --> 11:30.000
IN THE YEAR AND A HALF
I WAS THERE,

11:30.000 --> 11:31.858
IN THE YEAR AND A HALF
I WAS THERE,

11:31.858 --> 11:32.989
I SAW AT LEAST 50 PEOPLE
COME AND GO.

11:32.989 --> 11:34.821
50?

11:34.821 --> 11:36.813
THEY WERE IN AND OUT SO FAST.

11:36.813 --> 11:37.935
<i>WOW.</i>

11:37.935 --> 11:39.917
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN CUSTOMERS
COMPLAINED ABOUT THEIR FOOD?

11:39.917 --> 11:41.919
THEY GET TOLD
THAT THEY'RE WRONG,

11:41.919 --> 11:44.863
THAT, YOU KNOW, "NO, WE HAVE
THE BEST FOOD IN THE COUNTRY.

11:44.863 --> 11:45.904
YOU'RE WRONG.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.929
WHEN AMY AND SAMY
FINALLY ARRIVED...

11:49.929 --> 11:50.930
YOU DON'T LOOK VERY HAPPY.

11:50.930 --> 11:52.051
I'M...EXHAUSTED.
TIRED.

11:52.051 --> 11:53.883
I WANTED TO CONFRONT THEM

11:53.883 --> 11:54.965
WITH THE INFORMATION
I HAD LEARNED.

11:54.965 --> 11:57.888
HAVE YOU NOT HAD A TURNOVER
OF MORE THAN 50 PEOPLE?

11:57.888 --> 12:00.000
50 STAFF?
CAN YOU PROVE THAT TO ME?

12:00.000 --> 12:01.002
50 STAFF?
CAN YOU PROVE THAT TO ME?

12:01.002 --> 12:02.984
SHE WAS WRONG.

12:02.984 --> 12:04.976
100, OR EVEN MORE THAN 100.

12:04.976 --> 12:06.939
AND AFTER
A VERY TENSE CONVERSATION

12:06.939 --> 12:08.861
IN WHICH WE WERE GOING
AROUND IN CIRCLES...

12:08.861 --> 12:09.952
<i>WHAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH</i>

12:09.952 --> 12:11.063
WERE THE COMMENTS YOU WERE
SAYING TO ME LAST NIGHT.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.036
<i>I'M HERE TO SHOW YOU</i>
<i>WHAT'S RIGHT,</i>

12:13.036 --> 12:14.908
AND YOU CAN'T TAKE THAT.

12:14.908 --> 12:17.000
I REALIZED THAT SAMY AND AMY
WERE NOT OPEN

12:17.000 --> 12:21.015
EVEN IN THE SLIGHTEST
TO MAKING ANY CHANGES.

12:21.015 --> 12:22.957
ALL THAT'S HAPPENED
IS WE HAVE BEEN ATTACKED.

12:22.957 --> 12:23.988
ATTACKED?

12:23.988 --> 12:25.871
ATTACKED!

12:25.871 --> 12:26.952
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU CALL IT.

12:26.952 --> 12:28.013
THIS IS A RESTAURANT
THAT IS IN CRISIS,

12:28.013 --> 12:30.000
WITH A DELUSIONAL OWNER
THAT CAN'T TAKE CRITICISM.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.008
WITH A DELUSIONAL OWNER
THAT CAN'T TAKE CRITICISM.

12:32.008 --> 12:34.991
SO FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME

12:34.991 --> 12:36.964
I DID SOMETHING
I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD DO.

12:36.964 --> 12:40.978
I CAN'T HELP PEOPLE
THAT CAN'T HELP THEMSELVES.

12:40.978 --> 12:43.922
<i>THE RIGHT THING FOR ME</i>
<i>IS TO GET OUT OF HERE.</i>

12:43.922 --> 12:47.035
GOOD LUCK.

12:47.035 --> 12:48.097
GOOD.
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED.

12:48.097 --> 12:49.989
YEAH, OF COURSE
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED.

12:49.989 --> 12:51.971
DON'T WANNA PARTICIPATE
IN THIS BULL.

12:51.971 --> 12:53.022
WOW.

12:54.024 --> 12:55.135
COMING UP...

12:55.135 --> 12:57.127
THE STORY JUST WENT VIRAL.

12:57.127 --> 13:00.000
THEY BECAME THE NUMBER-ONE
TRENDING STORY IN AMERICA.

13:00.000 --> 13:00.111
THEY BECAME THE NUMBER-ONE
TRENDING STORY IN AMERICA.

13:00.111 --> 13:03.014
THERE WERE THREATS,
NASTY ONLINE MESSAGES.

13:03.014 --> 13:04.916
FIND OUT HOW IT HAPPENED.

13:04.916 --> 13:06.108
EVERYONE WAS
UNDER THE CONSENSUS

13:06.108 --> 13:08.961
THAT THESE PEOPLE WERE NOT
PARTICULARLY NORMAL.

13:08.961 --> 13:11.143
AND WE'LL SHOW YOU
SOME NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN FOOTAGE

13:11.143 --> 13:14.047
OF AMY AND SAMY
WITH CHEF RAMSAY

13:14.047 --> 13:15.158
THAT YOU HAVE TO SEE
TO BELIEVE.

13:15.158 --> 13:18.012
YOU CAN PULL THE WOOL
OVER YOUR HUSBAND'S EYES,

13:18.012 --> 13:19.033
BUT YOU CAN'T DO IT TO ME.

13:19.033 --> 13:20.154
I WANT YOU TO JUST SHUT UP.

13:20.154 --> 13:21.966
THEN...

13:21.966 --> 13:23.017
HOW ARE YOU?
<i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARE!</i>

13:23.017 --> 13:24.079
YES!

13:24.079 --> 13:25.170
A FULL UPDATE
ON WHAT HAS HAPPENED

13:25.170 --> 13:26.952
TO AMY'S BAKING COMPANY.

13:26.952 --> 13:29.014
SAMY SAW THAT I HAD TAKEN

13:29.014 --> 13:30.000
A $5 TIP,
AND TOLD ME THAT I'M A THIEF

13:30.000 --> 13:31.067
A $5 TIP,
AND TOLD ME THAT I'M A THIEF

13:31.067 --> 13:32.148
AND GET OUT
OF HIS RESTAURANT.

13:32.148 --> 13:34.040
AND LATER...

13:34.040 --> 13:35.101
IT'S WILD...
ARE WE BEING PUNK'D?

13:35.101 --> 13:36.984
IT'S LOUD...

13:36.984 --> 13:38.175
HE HAS NO BALLS!
HE'S JEALOUS OF MY BALLS!

13:38.175 --> 13:41.048
IT'S AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW
WITH AMY AND SAMY...

13:41.048 --> 13:42.961
IT'S LIKE DISNEYLAND
FOR THE CRAZIES.

13:42.961 --> 13:45.043
AS WE TRACK THEM DOWN
IN SCOTTSDALE, ARIZONA.

13:45.043 --> 13:48.167
WE HAVE TO SHOW THE WORLD
WHAT REALLY HAVE TO OFFER HERE

13:48.167 --> 13:51.090
AT AMY'S BAKING COMPANY,
AND THAT'S IT!

13:59.304 --> 14:01.545
SINCE THE AIRING
OF AMY'S BAKING COMPANY,

14:01.545 --> 14:03.935
PEOPLE WERE VERY ANXIOUS
TO EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS

14:03.935 --> 14:06.065
IN A VARIETY OF WAYS
ON THE INTERNET.

14:06.065 --> 14:08.344
ONE OF THE THINGS
THAT GOT A LOT OF ATTENTION

14:08.344 --> 14:11.460
WAS THIS CARTOON
MADE BY THE JAXAMOTO COMPANY.

14:11.460 --> 14:14.343
HE IS MY SOUL MATE AND WE'RE
IN THIS BUSINESS TOGETHER.

14:14.343 --> 14:15.404
FINE, BUT--
AND WE STAND STRONG.

14:15.404 --> 14:17.346
WE HAVE TO BECAUSE

14:17.346 --> 14:19.459
THERE'S A LOT OF ONLINE BULLIES
AND HATERS AND BLOGGERS.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.461
THEY'RE DIRTY,
THEY'RE LAZY.

14:21.461 --> 14:24.465
I HAVE ISSUES WITH CUSTOMERS
THAT ARE ONLINE BULLIES,

14:24.465 --> 14:24.917
AND THEY BULLY ME,
BULLY MY HUSBAND, THAT'S A JOKE.

14:24.917 --> 14:27.328
AND THEY BULLY ME,
BULLY MY HUSBAND, THAT'S A JOKE.

14:27.328 --> 14:28.439
"ONLINE BULLIES"?

14:28.439 --> 14:30.382
THEY'RE USED TO EATING
PROCESSED WOODCHIPS,

14:30.382 --> 14:32.444
OR USED TO GETTING THINGS
FOR FREE, IT'S DISGUSTING.

14:32.444 --> 14:34.356
BUT WHEN DID THIS START?

14:34.356 --> 14:37.410
THIS GUY CAME IN THAT STARTED
THIS ENTIRE ONLINE BULLYING.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.412
I TOLD HIM
I THOUGHT HE WAS A LOSER,

14:39.412 --> 14:41.374
HE WAS A MORON.
DO YOU HAVE CHILDREN?

14:41.374 --> 14:42.456
WELL, WE HAVE
THREE LITTLE BOYS,

14:42.456 --> 14:44.358
BUT THEY'RE TRAPPED
INSIDE CAT BODIES.
<i>WOW.</i>

14:44.358 --> 14:45.419
<i>YOU LOOK DISAPPOINTED.</i>

14:45.419 --> 14:47.391
THESE ARE STORE-BOUGHT,
CRAP, FROZEN RAVIOLI.

14:47.391 --> 14:48.583
THEY'RE NOT CRAP,
AND THEY'RE DELICIOUS,

14:48.583 --> 14:50.575
AND I--THE FIRST TIME
I'VE EVER--OKAY.
<i>OH! OH, MY GOD!</i>

14:50.575 --> 14:52.527
DID YOU TASTE IT?
YOU DIDN'T TASTE THAT ONE.

14:52.527 --> 14:54.370
THIS IS...

14:54.370 --> 14:54.917
YOU GUYS,
I MAKE EXCELLENT FOOD.

14:54.917 --> 14:55.401
YOU GUYS,
I MAKE EXCELLENT FOOD.

14:55.401 --> 14:56.542
YOU ALL.

14:56.542 --> 14:58.444
THINK THAT YOU CAN COME IN HERE
AND SAY THESE THINGS!

14:58.444 --> 14:59.496
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

14:59.496 --> 15:00.547
<i>THIS IS RIDICULOUS!</i>

15:02.449 --> 15:04.602
I SPEAK FELINE.
MEOW, MEOW, MEOW.

15:06.514 --> 15:08.416
MEOW, MEOW, MEOW.

15:16.405 --> 15:18.578
THAT CARTOON
WAS JUST ONE EXAMPLE

15:18.578 --> 15:20.480
OF THE MEDIA EXPLOSION
THAT OCCURED

15:20.480 --> 15:22.623
AFTER THE AIRING
OF AMY'S BAKING COPMANY.

15:22.623 --> 15:24.535
BUT THERE WAS A LOT MORE,

15:24.535 --> 15:24.917
AS THIS 50-SEATER RESTAURANT
WENT FROM OBSCURITY

15:24.917 --> 15:27.438
AS THIS 50-SEATER RESTAURANT
WENT FROM OBSCURITY

15:27.438 --> 15:28.610
TO A NATIONAL PHENOMENON

15:28.610 --> 15:32.454
AND BECAME THE NUMBER-ONE
TRENDING STORY ON THE INTERNET.

15:32.454 --> 15:34.617
SO THERE'S THIS RESTAURANT
CALLED AMY'S BAKING COPMANY.

15:34.617 --> 15:36.479
THE OWNERS ARE NUTJOBS!

15:36.479 --> 15:37.580
THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME
IN THE HISTORY OF THE SHOW

15:37.580 --> 15:39.512
HE DECIDED THIS PLACE
WAS BEYOND HELP.

15:39.512 --> 15:41.555
GORDON RAMSAY EVEN IS LIKE,
"I'M OUTTA HERE."

15:41.555 --> 15:43.447
PEOPLE JUST
COULD NOT BELIEVE

15:43.447 --> 15:44.488
HOW THIS COUPLE TREATED
THEIR CUSTOMERS.

15:44.488 --> 15:45.599
AND THEY JUST KEPT GOING
AND GOING

15:45.599 --> 15:47.502
WITH THE SAME STUFF,
OVER AND OVER.
<i>RIGHT.</i>

15:47.502 --> 15:49.464
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE ARE TURNING
TO SOCIAL MEDIA

15:49.464 --> 15:50.505
TO VOICE THEIR ANGER.

15:50.505 --> 15:52.517
SAMY AND AMY--
THEY'RE ON FACEBOOK NOW,

15:52.517 --> 15:54.450
JUST TRASHING EVERYBODY.

15:54.450 --> 15:54.917
IT GOT UGLIER AND UGLIER
FROM THERE.

15:54.917 --> 15:55.541
IT GOT UGLIER AND UGLIER
FROM THERE.

15:55.541 --> 15:57.473
THERE WERE THREATS,
NASTY ONLINE MESSAGES.

15:57.473 --> 15:58.504
THESE PEOPLE
ARE FREAKING CRAZY.

15:58.504 --> 15:59.586
THIS IS WHAT YOU DON'T EVER DO.

15:59.586 --> 16:00.597
I'M ACTUALLY IN AWE.

16:00.597 --> 16:02.489
A LOT OF ACTION
ON SOCIAL MEDIA.

16:02.489 --> 16:03.590
MEMES AND JOKES.

16:03.590 --> 16:05.513
- CHILD OF GOD!
- AND PHOTOSHOPS.

16:05.513 --> 16:06.554
GIFs.

16:06.554 --> 16:08.466
WORLDWIDE BACKLASH.

16:08.466 --> 16:09.557
UNBELIEVABLE TO SEE
ALL OF IT BUBBLE UP ONLINE.

16:09.557 --> 16:11.510
WOW! IT WAS SO CRAZY.

16:11.510 --> 16:13.542
THE EPISODE
OF <i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARES</i>

16:13.542 --> 16:15.614
ABOUT AMY'S BAKING COMPANY
WAS A PRETTY SPECIAL ONE

16:15.614 --> 16:17.497
BECAUSE IT WAS THE FIRST TIME

16:17.497 --> 16:18.688
GORDON RAMSAY WALKED AWAY
FROM A RESTAURANT...

16:18.688 --> 16:20.490
WOW.

16:20.490 --> 16:21.561
WHICH IS SOMETHING
HE NEVER DOES,

16:21.561 --> 16:24.645
AND IT DEFINITELY SPARKED
A CURIOUSITY.

16:24.645 --> 16:24.917
PEOPLE WERE INCREDIBLY
INTERESTED IN THIS STORY.

16:24.917 --> 16:27.699
PEOPLE WERE INCREDIBLY
INTERESTED IN THIS STORY.

16:27.699 --> 16:29.671
THERE WERE THOUSANDS
OF COMMENTS

16:29.671 --> 16:31.593
DIRECTED AT AMY AND SAMY

16:31.593 --> 16:33.696
BASICALLY CALLING THEM
BAT- CRAZY.

16:33.696 --> 16:35.658
EVERYONE WAS
UNDER THE CONSENSUS

16:35.658 --> 16:38.591
THAT THESE PEOPLE
WERE NOT PARTICULARLY NORMAL.

16:38.591 --> 16:40.493
THE PROBLEM WAS

16:40.493 --> 16:42.686
AMY AND SAMY STARTED RESPONDING
TO THESE COMMENTS.

16:42.686 --> 16:44.608
AS THE COMMENTS
STARTED POURING IN,

16:44.608 --> 16:47.722
AMY AND SAMY JUST KEPT POSTING,
POSTING, AND POSTING.

16:47.722 --> 16:49.554
THEY JUST ATTACKED EVERYBODY

16:49.554 --> 16:51.496
AND JUST POSTED STATUS
AFTER STATUS

16:51.496 --> 16:54.590
JUST SWEARING, CALLING PEOPLE
OUT ON EVERYTHING,

16:54.590 --> 16:54.917
AND JUST CONTINUING
THEIR CYBERBULLYING

16:54.917 --> 16:55.731
AND JUST CONTINUING
THEIR CYBERBULLYING

16:55.731 --> 16:58.605
THAT THEY DO BEST, I GUESS.

16:58.605 --> 17:00.557
WE JUST SORT OF
KEPT WATCHING THEM

17:00.557 --> 17:03.520
IN A MIXTURE
OF SHOCK AND HORROR.

17:03.520 --> 17:06.634
YOU JUST WANNA TELL THESE
PEOPLE, "NO, DON'T DO THAT.

17:06.634 --> 17:08.666
THAT'S A BAD IDEA."

17:08.666 --> 17:10.569
AND THE STORY JUST WENT VIRAL.

17:10.569 --> 17:12.541
PEOPLE WERE SHARING
ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF CONTENT

17:12.541 --> 17:14.523
FROM SATIRICAL CARTOONS...

17:14.523 --> 17:16.546
THINK THAT YOU CAN COME
IN HERE AND SAY THESE THINGS.

17:16.546 --> 17:17.687
TO YOUTUBE VIDEOS...

17:17.687 --> 17:19.609
♪ MEOW, MEOW, MEOW,
MEOW, MEOW ♪

17:19.609 --> 17:21.531
CLIPS, GIFs...

17:21.531 --> 17:24.575
YOU WOULD JUST TYPE IN "AMY'S"
AND EVERYTHING WOULD COME UP

17:24.575 --> 17:24.917
RELATED
TO AMY'S BAKING COMPANY.

17:24.917 --> 17:26.537
RELATED
TO AMY'S BAKING COMPANY.

17:26.537 --> 17:28.610
JUST PAGES AND PAGES.

17:28.610 --> 17:31.663
MY WRITE-UP OF
AMY'S BAKING COMPANY'S MELTDOWN,

17:31.663 --> 17:34.627
IN ABOUT THREE DAYS IT HAD
REACHED 3 MILLION VIEWS,

17:34.627 --> 17:36.549
WHICH IS
THE HIGHEST-TRAFFIC POST

17:36.549 --> 17:37.560
I'VE EVER DONE
AT <i>BUZZFEED.</i>

17:37.560 --> 17:39.733
IT BECAME
THE 21ST CENTURY VERSION

17:39.733 --> 17:41.625
OF A WATERCOOLER CONVERSATION.

17:41.625 --> 17:43.767
EVERYONE THOUGHT
IT WAS JUST THE CRAZIEST THING.

17:43.767 --> 17:46.691
IT WAS LIKE COVERING
A BREAKING NEWS STORY,

17:46.691 --> 17:48.663
EXCEPT INSTEAD OF POLITICS

17:48.663 --> 17:52.588
WE WERE FOLLOWING
THIS LITTLE EATERY IN ARIZONA.

17:52.588 --> 17:54.917
HONESTLY I'VE NEVER SEEN
SOMETHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.

17:54.917 --> 17:55.591
HONESTLY I'VE NEVER SEEN
SOMETHING LIKE THIS BEFORE.

17:55.591 --> 17:57.804
THEY WERE JUST THAT CRAZY.

17:57.804 --> 17:59.636
AFTER THE DUST CLEARED,

17:59.636 --> 18:01.598
AMY AND SAMY TOOK
TO THEIR FACEBOOK

18:01.598 --> 18:03.580
AND SAID THAT IT WAS HACKED

18:03.580 --> 18:04.712
AND THAT ALL THE STATEMENTS
THAT CAME PREVIOUSLY

18:04.712 --> 18:06.604
WEREN'T THEM.

18:06.604 --> 18:09.628
AND IT WAS MET
WITH THIS REALLY HILARIOUS,

18:09.628 --> 18:12.621
"ARE YOU KIDDING ME?"
COLLECTIVELY FROM THE INTERNET.

18:12.621 --> 18:13.792
NO, CLEARLY YOU WEREN'T HACKED
AT ALL.

18:13.792 --> 18:15.635
I SAW THE WAY
THAT THEY TREATED PEOPLE,

18:15.635 --> 18:16.756
AND WHAT THEY SAID ON FACEBOOK

18:16.756 --> 18:18.628
IS EXACTLY HOW THEY ACTED
IN REAL LIFE.

18:18.628 --> 18:21.812
THERE IS THE PHRASE,
"NO PUBLICITY IS BAD PUBLICITY."

18:21.812 --> 18:24.615
BUT AT THE SAME TIME
IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL,

18:24.615 --> 18:24.917
THE INTERNET
CAN TURN YOU INTO A SIDESHOW.

18:24.917 --> 18:26.607
THE INTERNET
CAN TURN YOU INTO A SIDESHOW.

18:26.607 --> 18:28.730
AND I THINK THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

18:31.683 --> 18:32.835
THE AFTERMATH OF THE EPISODE

18:32.835 --> 18:34.777
CERTAINLY TOOK ON
A LIFE OF ITS OWN.

18:34.777 --> 18:37.640
I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST WALKED
INTO AMY'S BAKING COMPANY,

18:37.640 --> 18:39.633
THINKING, "HMM!
WHY AM I HERE?"

18:39.633 --> 18:42.656
THE DINING ROOM IS GORGEOUS,
THE KITCHEN IS SPOTLESS--

18:42.656 --> 18:44.779
SOMETHING I'M DEFINITELY NOT
USED TO ON <i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARES.</i>

18:44.779 --> 18:46.831
BUT WHEN AMY GAVE ME A TOUR
OF HER KITCHEN,

18:46.831 --> 18:49.644
THINGS STARTED
GETTING A LITTLE STRANGE.

18:49.644 --> 18:51.637
NOW, THIS FOOTAGE
HAS NEVER BEEN SEEN BEFORE.

18:51.637 --> 18:54.660
TAKE A LOOK.

18:54.660 --> 18:54.917
- SO ARE YOU THE SOUS CHEF?
<i>- YES. YES.</i>

18:54.917 --> 18:55.851
- SO ARE YOU THE SOUS CHEF?
<i>- YES. YES.</i>

18:55.851 --> 18:57.684
HERE, YOU CAN SEE.
I'LL TAKE YOU TO OUR LINE.

18:57.684 --> 18:59.686
UM, DO WE HAVE
ANY, UH, MALE CHEFS?

18:59.686 --> 19:00.677
<i>NO.</i>

19:00.677 --> 19:01.718
NO? ALL FEMALES?
<i>YES.</i>

19:01.718 --> 19:02.760
ONLY GIRLS, YEAH.
WHY'S THAT?

19:02.760 --> 19:03.831
YES.
BECAUSE...IT'S TOO TINY.

19:03.831 --> 19:04.862
IT'S TINY.

19:04.862 --> 19:06.884
AND MY WIFE, SHE WANT ONLY ME
TO BE NEAR HER.

19:06.884 --> 19:08.707
SHE DOESN'T WANT MEN,
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE...

19:08.707 --> 19:09.778
I DON'T LIKE
TO BUMP INTO MEN.

19:09.778 --> 19:11.720
I FEEL WE'RE COMFORTABLE
WORKING WITH GIRLS

19:11.720 --> 19:13.702
BECAUSE MY KITCHEN
IS SO TINY.
WOW!

19:13.702 --> 19:14.794
WE BEND OVER,
WE BUMP INTO EACH OTHER.

19:14.794 --> 19:16.876
THE MALE CHEFS,
THEIR EGO IS TOO BIG

19:16.876 --> 19:19.689
AND THERE'S--IT'S TOO LITTLE,
MY KITCHEN, SO THEY LEAVE.

19:19.689 --> 19:20.731
I SHOW THEM THE DOOR.

19:20.731 --> 19:21.832
AND THEY DON'T HAVE
MY STANDARDS.

19:21.832 --> 19:22.893
THEY CAN'T CLEAN
LIKE I DO.
<i>RIGHT!</i>

19:22.893 --> 19:24.895
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE
DOING ME A FAVOR.

19:24.895 --> 19:24.917
THIS IS HOW WE WORK.
<i>YEAH.</i>

19:24.917 --> 19:26.788
THIS IS HOW WE WORK.
<i>YEAH.</i>

19:26.788 --> 19:29.721
I MEAN, I WORK METICULOUSLY
BECAUSE MY CUSTOMERS DESERVE IT.

19:29.721 --> 19:31.793
<i>OKAY, WOW.</i>

19:31.793 --> 19:32.845
COMING UP...

19:32.845 --> 19:34.717
OH, GOD, YOU'RE CRAZY.
WOW!

19:34.717 --> 19:35.898
SOME SHOCKING BONUS MATERIAL

19:35.898 --> 19:37.861
THAT HAS NEVER BEEN SEEN
UNTIL TONIGHT.

19:37.861 --> 19:39.783
IF THEY COULD WORK
LIKE MY HUSBAND WORKS,

19:39.783 --> 19:41.725
<i>THEY WOULD GET THEIR TIPS,</i>
<i>HE'S TOLD THEM!</i>

19:42.896 --> 19:44.909
AND LATER, AN UPDATE
ON WHAT HAS HAPPENED

19:44.909 --> 19:47.842
AT AMY'S BAKING COMPANY
SINCE CHEF RAMSAY WALKED OUT.

19:47.842 --> 19:49.865
NOW IT'S LIKE A TOURIST SITE.

19:49.865 --> 19:53.799
EVERYBODY WANTS TO SEE
IF AMY WAS ACTUALLY THAT CRAZY.

19:53.799 --> 19:54.917
PLUS, OUR REVEALING
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW

19:54.917 --> 19:56.723
PLUS, OUR REVEALING
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW

19:56.723 --> 19:57.804
WITH SAMY AND AMY.

19:57.804 --> 19:58.935
IT'S LIKE DISNEYLAND
FOR THE CRAZIES.

20:11.810 --> 20:13.802
WE HAVE
THREE LITTLE BOYS,

20:13.802 --> 20:15.735
BUT THEY'RE TRAPPED
INSIDE KITTY-CATS' BODIES.

20:15.735 --> 20:16.826
MEOW!

20:16.826 --> 20:18.938
ZETA DOES IT LIKE THIS...
"MEOW!"

20:18.938 --> 20:20.841
AND SOMETIMES
HE STICKS HIS TONGUE OUT

20:20.841 --> 20:21.902
IF HE WANTS TREATS.

20:23.914 --> 20:25.947
JADE--IF YOU ASK HIM
A QUESTION,

20:25.947 --> 20:28.870
YOU SAY, "JADE!"
HE'LL ACTUALLY RESPOND,

20:28.870 --> 20:29.971
"MEOW?"

20:29.971 --> 20:31.874
HE RESPONDS LIKE THAT.

20:31.874 --> 20:33.926
AND LEO--HE ACTUALLY TALKS.

20:33.926 --> 20:33.953
LEO WILL SING TO YOU.

20:33.953 --> 20:35.818
LEO WILL SING TO YOU.

20:35.818 --> 20:37.961
"♪ MEOW, MEOW, MEOW,

20:37.961 --> 20:40.904

20:40.904 --> 20:42.846
WHERE OUR REPORTER
ANA GARCIA

20:42.846 --> 20:44.779
CATCHES UP WITH SAMY AND AMY.

20:44.779 --> 20:46.921
BUT FIRST, LET ME TELL YOU
ABOUT SOME MORE

20:46.921 --> 20:49.004
NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN FOOTAGE.

20:49.004 --> 20:50.926
DURING MY LUNCH
AT AMY'S BAKING COMPANY,

20:50.926 --> 20:53.008
I KEPT TELLING SAMY
WHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE FOOD.

20:53.008 --> 20:55.011
BUT HE REFUSED TO TELL AMY.

20:55.011 --> 20:56.993
I REMEMBER THINKING,
"HOW STRANGE WAS THAT

20:56.993 --> 20:58.975
THAT HE WOULDN'T
RELAY ANYTHING TO HIS WIFE?"

20:58.975 --> 21:00.968
BUT WHEN I CAME BACK
FOR DINNER SERVICE,

21:00.968 --> 21:03.953
I LEARNED WHY SAMY NEVER SHARES
ANY NEGATIVE COMMENTS WITH AMY.

21:03.953 --> 21:04.011
I LEARNED WHY SAMY NEVER SHARES
ANY NEGATIVE COMMENTS WITH AMY.

21:04.011 --> 21:08.847
BECAUSE SHE'S COMPLETELY
INCAPABLE OF TAKING CRITICISM.

21:08.847 --> 21:11.009
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU TOOK
CRITICISM FROM A CUSTOMER

21:11.009 --> 21:12.952
ABOUT ONE OF YOUR DISHES?

21:12.952 --> 21:15.955
UM, THE OTHER DAY I DID.
WHAT WAS IT?

21:15.955 --> 21:17.817
IT WAS A CAESAR SALAD.

21:17.817 --> 21:18.969
THE LADY DIDN'T LIKE
THE PROSCIUTTO

21:18.969 --> 21:20.030
IN HER CAESAR SALAD.

21:20.030 --> 21:22.002
BUT IT'S ON THE MENU,
AND IF THEY DON'T LIKE IT,

21:22.002 --> 21:24.014
THEY CAN HAVE IT WITHOUT IT--
SIMPLE.

21:24.014 --> 21:25.907
I MEAN...
WOW.

21:25.907 --> 21:27.018
I'VE TAKEN CRITICISM...
OH, MY GOD.

21:27.018 --> 21:29.040
<i>DO YOU KNOW WHAT?</i>
<i>CRITICISM IS HEALTHY.</i>

21:29.040 --> 21:31.033
UNFORTUNATELY NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE
TOLD YOU THE TRUTH.

21:31.033 --> 21:33.005
OH, GOD, YOU'RE CRAZY.
NOW THERE YOU GO.

21:33.005 --> 21:33.953
PHENOMENAL DESSERT,
STORE-BOUGHT, FROZEN RAVIOLI.

21:33.953 --> 21:35.037
PHENOMENAL DESSERT,
STORE-BOUGHT, FROZEN RAVIOLI.

21:35.037 --> 21:36.849
YET YOU STILL DON'T GET IT.

21:36.849 --> 21:38.952
IF I COULD MAKE EVERYTHING
FROM SCRATCH, I WOULD.

21:38.952 --> 21:40.874
YOU CAN PULL THE WOOL
OVER YOUR HUSBADN'S EYES,

21:40.874 --> 21:42.025
BUT YOU CAN'T DO IT
TO ME.

21:42.025 --> 21:43.037
OH, MY GOD.

21:43.037 --> 21:45.019
YOU'RE NOT EVEN PREPARED
TO LISTEN TO ANYTHING.

21:45.019 --> 21:47.982
<i>THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT GIVING</i>
<i>ME ANY CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM.</i>

21:47.982 --> 21:49.985
ADVICE I'M HERE FOR.
YOU'RE JUST STANDING THERE,
TALKING...

21:49.985 --> 21:51.897
YOU'RE JUST IN DENIAL.
SAYING THINGS THAT AREN'T EVEN
MAKING SENSE.

21:51.897 --> 21:53.068
I'M NOT IN DENIAL
ABOUT ANYTHING.

21:53.068 --> 21:55.071
I'VE NEVER HAD
AN ISSUE BEFORFE.

21:55.071 --> 21:56.873
BECAUSE YOUR HUSBAND
DIDN'T TELL YOU.

21:56.873 --> 21:58.905
NO. BECAUSE I KNOW--
HE'S SCARED TO.

21:58.905 --> 22:00.057
HE'S NOT SCARED OF ME, NO.

22:00.057 --> 22:02.069
THAT MAN ISN'T SCARED OF YOU.
HE'S NOT SCARED OF ANYBODY.

22:02.069 --> 22:03.953
<i>MY HUSBAND,</i>
<i>IF THERE EVER IS A PROBLEM,</i>

22:03.953 --> 22:04.081
<i>MY HUSBAND,</i>
<i>IF THERE EVER IS A PROBLEM,</i>

22:04.081 --> 22:06.915
IMMEDIATELY HE'LL BRING IT BACK
AND LET CHRISTINE KNOW.

22:07.956 --> 22:09.027
AND IT'S VERY RARE
THAT IT HAPPENS.

22:09.027 --> 22:10.879
DID HE TELL YOU TODAY?
YOU KNEW I WAS COMING TODAY.

22:10.879 --> 22:12.081
WELL, I WAS TRYING TO FIND--
<i>IF YOU COME INTO MY RESTAURANT,</i>

22:12.081 --> 22:13.973
<i>I'LL MAKE SURE</i>
<i>EVERY  PLATE</i>

22:13.973 --> 22:15.074
THAT YOU FINISH
IS IN FRONT OF ME.

22:15.074 --> 22:17.086
I WAS TRYING TO GET FEEDBACK
AND NO ONE WOULD GIVE IT TO ME.

22:17.086 --> 22:18.899
<i>WHY NOT?</i>

22:18.899 --> 22:21.001
I GAVE YOUR HUSBAND
A NUMBER OF COMMENTS,

22:21.001 --> 22:22.102
LUNCHTIME...
<i>BUT I DIDN'T KNOW.</i>

22:22.102 --> 22:24.035
NOBODY WOULD SHARE THEM WITH ME.
'CAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE KNOWING.

22:24.035 --> 22:26.948
'CAUSE YOU DON'T WANT
TO CHANGE.

22:26.948 --> 22:29.060
THERE IS SOMETHING
I WANT TO CLEAR UP.

22:29.060 --> 22:31.043
THEY ASKED ME
TO COME AND HELP THEM.

22:31.043 --> 22:33.896
RIGHT NOW,
I WANNA SHOW YOU SOMETHING

22:33.896 --> 22:33.953
THAT'S ONLY EVER BEEN SEEN
BY MYSELF

22:33.953 --> 22:35.027
THAT'S ONLY EVER BEEN SEEN
BY MYSELF

22:35.027 --> 22:37.050
AND THE PRODUCERS
OF THIS SHOW.

22:37.050 --> 22:38.912
IT'S THEIR SUBMISSION VIDEO.

22:38.912 --> 22:40.934
OH, BOY.
CHECK IT OUT.

22:40.934 --> 22:42.086
SO THIS IS WHERE
ALL THE MAGIC HAPPENS.

22:43.137 --> 22:44.939
<i>HERE, WE HAVE THE WALK-IN.</i>

22:44.939 --> 22:46.000
OH, MY GOD, IT'S A MESS.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.952
THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS
WITH THIS RESTAURANT

22:47.952 --> 22:49.024
WOULD BE MY HUSBAND
IS TOO NERVOUS

22:49.024 --> 22:50.115
IN THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE.

22:50.115 --> 22:52.918
HE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE
A CUSTOMER SERVICE BACKGROUND

22:52.918 --> 22:54.130
IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM.

22:54.130 --> 22:55.972
I'M CHICKEN LIKE NO HEAD.

22:55.972 --> 22:57.073
YOU GO, I GO.
I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START.

22:57.073 --> 23:02.029
SAMY'S NEEDS TO BE REMOVED
FROM THIS SITUATION.

23:02.029 --> 23:03.120
A LOT OF TIMES,

23:03.120 --> 23:03.953
I THINK THAT CUSTOMERS
WILL PROBABLY NOT COME BACK

23:03.953 --> 23:05.142
I THINK THAT CUSTOMERS
WILL PROBABLY NOT COME BACK

23:05.142 --> 23:07.976
BECAUSE OF SOMETHING
THAT SAMY MAY HAVE SAID TO THEM.

23:07.976 --> 23:10.939
LIKE, FIRST REACTION
IS JUST TO KINDA YELL.

23:10.939 --> 23:13.953
YES, THERE HAVE BEEN
A FEW OCCASIONAL TIMES

23:13.953 --> 23:16.125
THAT HE HAS HAD AN INCIDENT,
AND THAT I, MYSELF,

23:16.125 --> 23:18.118
HAVE HAD AN--A FEW INCIDENTS
WITH CUSTOMERS.

23:18.118 --> 23:19.970
WE'RE NOT PERFECT.

23:19.970 --> 23:23.133
BUT WHEN PEOPLE COME IN
AND THEY'RE NOT NICE TO US,

23:23.133 --> 23:26.047
WE'RE NOT GOING
TO BE NICE BACK TO THEM.

23:26.047 --> 23:27.989
ON YELP, HORRIBLE THINGS WERE
WRITTEN ABOUT US

23:27.989 --> 23:29.110
THAT WERE NOT TRUE.

23:29.110 --> 23:32.044
I RETALIATED AND I TOLD HIM
WHAT I THOUGHT ABOUT HIM.

23:32.044 --> 23:33.195
I TOLD HIM THAT HE WAS A LOSER
AND HE WAS A MORON.

23:33.195 --> 23:33.953
HE WAS A TRAMP,

23:33.953 --> 23:35.107
HE WAS A TRAMP,

23:35.107 --> 23:37.120
AND HE WASN'T WELCOME
IN MY RESTAURANT, AND HE'S NOT.

23:37.120 --> 23:39.012
I HAVE NO PROBLEM
STANDING UP FOR MYSELF.

23:39.012 --> 23:41.175
ARE YOU--CAN YOU FILM HIM?
DO YOU SEE HIM?

23:41.175 --> 23:44.108
CAN--BABE, WE CAN...

23:44.108 --> 23:46.090
GO. I SAID GO.

23:46.090 --> 23:47.983
WHAT'S UP?

23:47.983 --> 23:49.024
WE HAD TO STOP
BECAUSE YOU WERE TALKING.

23:49.024 --> 23:50.115
I'M SORRY.
THAT'S OKAY.

23:50.115 --> 23:52.047
THIS IS THE FIRST KITCHEN
I'VE EVER WORKED IN

23:52.047 --> 23:53.189
WHERE WE'RE NOT REALLY
ALLOWED TO TALK TO EACH OTHER.

23:53.189 --> 23:57.043
"STOP TALKING! EVERYONE!
STOP! GET OUT! NO TALKING!

23:57.043 --> 23:58.204
I'M OUT HERE ALL BY MYSELF!"

23:58.204 --> 24:01.008
<i>SCREAMING.</i>
SCREAMING.

24:01.008 --> 24:03.200
SMALLEST THING CAN HAPPEN,
IT'S LIKE THE END OF THE WORLD.

24:03.200 --> 24:03.953
AND THEN THEY JUST KIND OF...

24:03.953 --> 24:05.213
AND THEN THEY JUST KIND OF...

24:05.213 --> 24:07.095
FEED OFF OF EACH OTHER.

24:07.095 --> 24:09.037
IN ORDER FOR MY RESTARAUNT
TO BE OPEN,

24:09.037 --> 24:10.148
WE BOTH HAVE TO BE HERE, 100%.

24:10.148 --> 24:12.101
THIS IS OUR BABY.

24:12.101 --> 24:14.223
HOLD ON A SECOND,
HOLD ON.

24:14.223 --> 24:17.106
I'M GETTING EXTREMELY NERVOUS
RIGHT NOW

24:17.106 --> 24:20.040
BECAUSE I HAVE SO MANY THINGS
GOING ON BACK HERE,

24:20.040 --> 24:21.231
AND I CAN'T REMEMBER
THE QUESTIONS YOU'RE ASKING.

24:21.231 --> 24:23.103
'CAUSE AS SOON AS YOU'RE
ASKING ME, I'M LOSING IT.

24:23.103 --> 24:26.167
IF YOU DON'T COME IN
AND SPEND $100 AT LEAST,

24:26.167 --> 24:27.258
IT'S LIKE, EH,
I DON'T NEED YOU.

24:27.258 --> 24:29.070
SPECTACULAR!

24:29.070 --> 24:31.203
MY FOOD IS THE BEST!
I'M TELLING YOU.

24:31.203 --> 24:33.035
I LOVE YOU.

24:33.035 --> 24:33.953
YOU'RE NUTS!

24:33.953 --> 24:34.226
YOU'RE NUTS!

24:34.226 --> 24:36.039
HE'S CRAZY, HE'S INSANE.
SHE'S MY BIG TIME.

24:36.039 --> 24:37.140
MEOW!

24:37.140 --> 24:38.141
COMING UP...

24:38.141 --> 24:39.182
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO KISS MY ASS.

24:39.182 --> 24:40.213
I WANT YOU
TO JUST SHUT UP.

24:40.213 --> 24:42.076
THE MADNESS CONTINUES.

24:42.076 --> 24:43.267
I'M NOT AFRAID OF YOU.
PLEASE.

24:43.267 --> 24:45.139
YOU'RE AFRAID OF THE TRUTH,
NOT ME--THE TRUTH.

24:45.139 --> 24:47.182
YOU'LL GET A FULL UPDATE
ON WHAT HAS HAPPENED

24:47.182 --> 24:48.263
TO AMY'S BAKING COMPANY.

24:48.263 --> 24:51.126
THEY'RE TRYING TO CASH IN
ON THEIR NOTORIETY.

24:51.126 --> 24:52.278
YOU'LL HEAR
FROM FORMER EMPLOYEES...

24:52.278 --> 24:55.231
AMY AND SAMY THOUGHT
EVERYONE WAS OUT TO GET THEM.

24:55.231 --> 24:57.113
AND WHAT RECENT DINERS
HAVE TO SAY.

24:57.113 --> 24:59.075
HE JUST SAID, "YOU HAVE TO GO,
YOU HAVE TO GO.

24:59.075 --> 25:00.257
YOU HAVE TO GO."

25:00.257 --> 25:02.269
THEN IT'S TIME
FOR AN OUT-OF-CONTROL SIT-DOWN

25:02.269 --> 25:03.953
WITH SAMY AND AMY.

25:03.953 --> 25:04.081
WITH SAMY AND AMY.

25:04.081 --> 25:06.174
HE HAS NO BALLS!
HE'S JEALOUS OF MY BALLS!

25:06.174 --> 25:08.156
THIS IS WHAT HE IS.

25:08.156 --> 25:11.210
BUT FIRST,
SOME NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN FOOTAGE

25:11.210 --> 25:13.272
AS CHEF RAMASAY QUESTIONS AMY
ABOUT HER PIZZA.

25:13.272 --> 25:15.304
HERE.
AND WHAT'S THE BASE
OF THE DOUGH?

25:15.304 --> 25:17.227
<i>THE RECIPE</i>
<i>FOR MY PIZZA DOUGH?</i>
MM-HMM.

25:17.227 --> 25:18.288
<i>IT'S A SECRET.</i>
OH, OKAY. WOW.

25:18.288 --> 25:20.200
AND PEOPLE LOVE IT!

25:20.200 --> 25:21.291
I HAVE PEOPLE TELL ME

25:21.291 --> 25:23.134
IT'S THE BEST PIZZA THAT
THEY'VE EVER HAD IN THEIR LIFE.

25:23.134 --> 25:24.185
WOW.

25:24.185 --> 25:25.286
<i>MY HUSBAND WILL TELL ME</i>
<i>OUR CUSTOMERS--</i>

25:25.286 --> 25:27.108
WELL, HE'S  NAUGHTY,

25:27.108 --> 25:28.199
'CAUSE MY PIZZA TODAY
WAS UNDERCOOKED.

25:28.199 --> 25:30.252
SO IT WAS RAW, AND I SAID,
"WILL YOU TAKE THAT BACK?"

25:30.252 --> 25:32.174
HE SAID, "I CAN'T TALK
DURING SERVICE."

25:32.174 --> 25:33.953
WHY IS THAT?

25:33.953 --> 25:34.166
WHY IS THAT?

25:34.166 --> 25:35.338
UH, MAYBE HE KNEW THAT
IT WOULD MAKE ME NERVOUS

25:35.338 --> 25:37.180
<i>IF YOU DIDN'T</i>
<i>ENJOY THE PIZZA.</i>

25:37.180 --> 25:38.301
YOU'RE A HUSBAND AND WIFE.
YEAH.

25:38.301 --> 25:40.173
YEAH, IT'S NOT AS IF YOU'RE...

25:40.173 --> 25:41.325
SORT OF MANAGER
AND ASSISTANT MANAGER.
OKAY.

25:41.325 --> 25:44.138
THE QUICKER YOU GO BACK
TO THE KITCHEN WITH CRITICISM...

25:44.138 --> 25:46.120
YEAH, I KNOW.
WE USUALLY DON'T HAVE CRITICISM.

25:46.120 --> 25:47.252
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
YOU DON'T HAVE CRITICISM?

25:47.252 --> 25:48.323
NOT USUALLY.

25:48.323 --> 25:50.285
WHY CAN'T YOU GO
AND TELL YOUR WIFE,

25:50.285 --> 25:52.258
"SWEETHEART, PIZZA--
WAKE UP.

25:52.258 --> 25:53.359
IT'S UNDERCOOKED"?

25:53.359 --> 25:55.311
I DON'T THINK YOUR PIZZA
WAS UNDERCOOKED.

25:55.311 --> 25:57.233
I CHECKED IT
AND I SEND PIZZAS.

25:57.233 --> 25:58.325
THAT'S MY NUMBER-ONE
SELLING PIZZA.

25:58.325 --> 26:00.307
SO YOU DID BRING IT BACK?
NO.

26:00.307 --> 26:02.139
I DIDN'T FIND OUT.
AND I ASKED YOU WHAT WAS WRONG.

26:02.139 --> 26:03.250
YOU SAID YOU CHECKED IT.

26:03.250 --> 26:03.953
<i>NO, I CHECKED IT</i>
<i>WHEN I TOOK IT OUT OF THE--</i>

26:03.953 --> 26:04.332
<i>NO, I CHECKED IT</i>
<i>WHEN I TOOK IT OUT OF THE--</i>

26:04.332 --> 26:05.343
HOLD ON.
IF YOU LET ME.

26:05.343 --> 26:07.185
I CHECKED IT
WHEN I TOOK IT OUT OF THE OVEN,

26:07.185 --> 26:08.266
JUST LIKE I DO
EVERY OTHER PIZZA,

26:08.266 --> 26:09.368
AND TO ME, IT WAS CRISPY
ON THE BOTTOM.

26:09.368 --> 26:11.370
WHEN I CUT IT, IT WAS CRUNCHY.
RIGHT. OKAY.

26:11.370 --> 26:13.262
SO TO ME IT WASN'T RAW.
OKAY, SO--

26:13.262 --> 26:14.323
BUT IF THEY SEND IT BACK--
YEAH, LET'S DRAW A LINE IN THAT.

26:14.323 --> 26:16.236
THAT'S YOUR VERSION.
<i>SURE.</i>

26:16.236 --> 26:17.387
'CAUSE YOU DIDN'T SEE IT
COME BACK.

26:17.387 --> 26:20.170
MY VERSION WAS
THE DOUGH WAS WET...
<i>UH-HUH.</i>

26:20.170 --> 26:21.392
UNDERCOOKED IN THE CENTER...
<i>OKAY.</i>

26:21.392 --> 26:24.385
OKAY, AND AROUND THE OUTSIDE
THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT GARNISH.

26:24.385 --> 26:26.187
SO IT WAS JUST...DRY.

26:26.187 --> 26:27.339
I SHOWED IT TO YOU.
YEAH, YOU DID.

26:27.339 --> 26:28.380
YOU DID, OF COURSE.
AND THE IDEA...
COME ON!

26:28.380 --> 26:30.262
YEAH, OKAY.
YEAH.

26:30.262 --> 26:31.313
BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO TELL HER.
NO, IT'S OKAY.

26:31.313 --> 26:33.195
NO, NO.
I SAID, "TOUCH THAT."

26:33.195 --> 26:33.953
I DID TOUCH IT.

26:33.953 --> 26:34.297
I DID TOUCH IT.

26:34.297 --> 26:36.219
IT'S NOT SLIGHTLY, 30 SECONDS.
IT WAS SOAKING WET.

26:36.219 --> 26:37.370
IT WAS RAW? OKAY.
IT WAS WET.

26:37.370 --> 26:40.184
WET? WELL, IS IT CHEESE
OR SOMETHING?

26:40.184 --> 26:42.386
NO, NO.
NO, IT'S NOT THE CHEESE! NO!

26:54.380 --> 26:57.243
HOW CAN YOU ATTRACT
GOOD STAFF

26:57.243 --> 26:59.266
WHEN YOU DON'T GIVE THEM
THE TIPS THEY DESERVE?

26:59.266 --> 27:01.328
MY HUSBAND PAYS THOSE GIRLS
$9 OR $10 AN HOUR...

27:01.328 --> 27:02.379
<i>YOU'RE NOT LISTENING.</i>

27:02.379 --> 27:04.282
TO DO NOTHING, OKAY?
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING.

27:04.282 --> 27:05.343
THEY DON'T DESERVE THOSE TIPS.

27:05.343 --> 27:07.215
IF THEY COULD WORK
LIKE MY HUSBAND WORKED--

27:07.215 --> 27:08.316
<i>OH, MY GOD.</i>

27:08.316 --> 27:09.297
IF THEY COULD WORK
LIKE MY HUSBAND WORKS...

27:09.297 --> 27:10.379
<i>AND WHY ARE YOU</i>
<i>SHOUTING AT ME?</i>

27:10.379 --> 27:11.410
AND IT DIDN'T REQUIRE HIM
TO RUN LIKE FOUR PEOPLE...

27:11.410 --> 27:12.451
<i>WHY ARE YOU</i>
<i>SHOUTING AT ME?</i>

27:12.451 --> 27:14.283
THEY WOULD GET THEIR TIPS.
HE'S TOLD THEM...

27:14.283 --> 27:15.325
<i>YOU'RE CONVINCED.</i>
"RUN LIKE I RUN...

27:15.325 --> 27:16.366
AND WORK LIKE I WORK
AND YOU CAN HAVE YOUR TIPS."

27:16.366 --> 27:16.980
HOW DELUDED.

27:16.980 --> 27:18.278
HOW DELUDED.

27:18.278 --> 27:19.329
I AM DELUDED.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

27:19.329 --> 27:22.243
OH, MY GOD.

27:22.243 --> 27:24.335
THERE WERE SO MANY MOMENTS
AT THIS RESTAURANT.

27:24.335 --> 27:26.257
BUT TRUTHFULLY
THERE IS ONLY SO MUCH

27:26.257 --> 27:27.439
YOU CAN PUT
INTO A ONE-HOUR SHOW.

27:27.439 --> 27:30.242
HERE'S AN UNBELIEVABLE EXCHANGE
THAT I HAD WITH AMY

27:30.242 --> 27:31.443
OVER A PACKAGE OF GNOCCHI.

27:33.346 --> 27:34.477
SO THESE GNOCCHI IN HERE.

27:34.477 --> 27:36.419
"NO REFRIGERATION REQUIRED."
WOW.

27:36.419 --> 27:37.480
WOW, WOW, WOW.

27:37.480 --> 27:39.343
THERE MUST BE A FEW CHEMICALS
IN THERE.

27:42.366 --> 27:44.278
DO WE SELL THESE GNOCCHI?
<i>I'M SORRY?</i>

27:44.278 --> 27:45.370
DO WE SELL THESE?
<i>YES.</i>

27:45.370 --> 27:46.401
<i>THOSE ARE THE GNOCCHI</i>
<i>THAT WE SELL.</i>

27:46.401 --> 27:46.980
AND "NO REFRIGERATION
REQUIRED."

27:46.980 --> 27:48.433
AND "NO REFRIGERATION
REQUIRED."

27:48.433 --> 27:51.317
<i>WHAT'S IN THEM?</i>

27:51.317 --> 27:52.358
LOOK AT THE BACK.
IT'LL TELL--

27:52.358 --> 27:54.420
I DON'T SAY THAT
THEY'RE ORGANIC, I NEVER DID.

27:54.420 --> 27:56.362
"WHAT'S IN THERE?"
YOU SAID, "LOOK ON THE BACK."

27:56.362 --> 27:58.315
LIKE SOME
SMARTASS ANSWER.

27:58.315 --> 27:59.416
OH, OKAY.

27:59.416 --> 28:01.398
YET YOU'RE PREPARED TO CHARGE
CUSTOMERS MONEY FOR THAT.

28:01.398 --> 28:03.301
I KNOW.

28:03.301 --> 28:04.362
AND YOU GET UPSET 'CAUSE
THEY'RE NOT KISSING YOUR ASS.

28:04.362 --> 28:05.443
I'M NOT UPSET WITH YOU.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO KISS MY ASS.

28:05.443 --> 28:08.366
<i>WOW. YEAH.</i>
I WANT YOU
TO JUST SHUT UP, AND...

28:08.366 --> 28:10.299
<i>WOW.</i>
GIVE ME A CHANCE
TO FINISH MY SENTENCE

28:10.299 --> 28:11.490
INSTEAD OF BEING RUDE.
<i>WOW, WOW, WOW.</i>

28:11.490 --> 28:13.352
THAT'S--I'M NOT PISSED OFF.
<i>I'VE SEEN IT ALL NOW.</i>

28:13.352 --> 28:15.335
'CAUSE YOU DON'T BOTHER ME
TO MAKE ME PISSED OFF.

28:15.335 --> 28:16.466
I HAVE SEEN IT ALL.

28:16.466 --> 28:16.980
<i>WELL, WE'RE MAKING EVERYTHING</i>
<i>PER ORDER.</i>

28:16.980 --> 28:18.338
<i>WELL, WE'RE MAKING EVERYTHING</i>
<i>PER ORDER.</i>

28:18.338 --> 28:20.431
<i>THIS IS...</i>
<i>YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT PRE-MADE.</i>

28:20.431 --> 28:21.502
WE DON'T HAVE PRE-MADE FOOD.

28:21.502 --> 28:23.314
WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE EVERYTHING
TO ORDER.

28:23.314 --> 28:24.415
<i>EXCEPT FOR THE RAVIOLIS.</i>

28:24.415 --> 28:26.418
YES, THE RAVIOLIS ARE PRE-MADE.
<i>AND THE FROZEN EGGPLANT.</i>

28:26.418 --> 28:27.529
<i>YES, THEY ARE.</i>
<i>IT'S FRESH.</i>

28:27.529 --> 28:30.442
<i>OF COURSE WE HAVE TO FREEZE IT</i>
<i>WHEN WE DROP IT IN THE FRYER</i>

28:30.442 --> 28:32.334
SO THE BREADING
DOESN'T COME OFF.

28:32.334 --> 28:33.466
WE DO IT LIKE THAT BECAUSE--
<i>AND THE GNOCCHI.</i>

28:33.466 --> 28:34.497
<i>I DO USE THOSE GNOCCHI.</i>

28:34.497 --> 28:36.499
YES.

28:36.499 --> 28:41.355
NO PITHY REPLY?
YES, I CARE A LOT.

28:41.355 --> 28:43.437
CHEF RAMSAY, I WOULD LIKE YOU
TO UNDERSTAND JUST SOMETHING.

28:43.437 --> 28:46.391
<i>YEAH, I'M FINDING IT,</i>
<i>RIGHT NOW, AMY,</i>

28:46.391 --> 28:46.980
<i>DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND YOU</i>
<i>ONE LITTLE BIT.</i>

28:46.980 --> 28:47.512
<i>DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND YOU</i>
<i>ONE LITTLE BIT.</i>

28:47.512 --> 28:49.354
I'VE GOT NOWHERE TO GO.

28:49.354 --> 28:50.436
EVERY TIME
I SAY SOMETHING TO YOU,

28:50.436 --> 28:51.457
YOU JUST SAY,
"HEY, MY CUSTOMERS LOVE IT."

28:51.457 --> 28:52.558
I'M NOT GONNA TALK
TO YOU RIGHT NOW

28:52.558 --> 28:54.430
BECAUSE I HAVE TO CONCENTRATE
ON THE LINE.

28:54.430 --> 28:55.421
THEN STOP.
CONCENTRATE THEN.

28:55.421 --> 28:57.354
I WILL.

28:57.354 --> 28:58.455
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO JUST SAID
YOU WANNA TALK TO ME.

28:58.455 --> 28:59.436
SO I'M CONFUSED.
I DID.

28:59.436 --> 29:01.388
I WANTED TO EXPLAIN TO YOU...
OH!

29:01.388 --> 29:02.460
THAT I'M NOT HERE TO--
I THINK YOU SHOULD FOCUS
ON YOUR WORK.

29:02.460 --> 29:03.581
YOU DON'T EVEN LET ME SPEAK.

29:03.581 --> 29:05.443
SO THERE'S NO POINT
IN TALKING TO YOU.
<i>TRY.</i>

29:05.443 --> 29:07.435
JUST LIKE MY HUSBAND.

29:07.435 --> 29:09.528
EVEN THOUGH MY VISIT
TO AMY'S BAKING COMPANY

29:09.528 --> 29:12.381
WAS A COMPLETE DISASTER
FROM DAY ONE,

29:12.381 --> 29:15.385
I CAME BACK ON DAY TWO
WITH A PLAN TO TURN IT AROUND.

29:15.385 --> 29:16.556
UNFORTUNATELY
I NEVER GOT TO IMPLEMENT IT

29:16.556 --> 29:16.980
BECAUSE IT BECAME CLEAR THAT
IT WOULD BE A WASTE OF TIME.

29:16.980 --> 29:20.401
BECAUSE IT BECAME CLEAR THAT
IT WOULD BE A WASTE OF TIME.

29:20.401 --> 29:21.492
I'M SURE YOU'RE WONDERING

29:21.492 --> 29:23.524
WHAT'S HAPPENED
TO THE RESTAURANT SINCE I LEFT.

29:23.524 --> 29:27.459
HERE WITH AN UPDATE
IS OUR REPORTER ANA GARCIA.

29:27.459 --> 29:28.520
THANKS, GORDON.

29:28.520 --> 29:31.473
I'M HERE IN SCOTTSDALE, ARIZONA,
TALKING TO LOCAL PEOPLE

29:31.473 --> 29:34.407
TO GET THEIR PERSPECTIVE
ON EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED

29:34.407 --> 29:35.498
SINCE THE SHOW AIRED--

29:35.498 --> 29:38.442
EVERYTHING FROM
THE SOCIAL MEDIA PHENOMENON

29:38.442 --> 29:40.484
TO HOW IT HAS AFFECTED
LOCAL BUSINESSES.

29:40.484 --> 29:43.477
AND I'M GOING TO TRY AND TALK
TO AMY AND SAMY.

29:43.477 --> 29:46.461
BUT FIRST, HERE'S AN UPDATE
ON HOW THE RESTAURANT IS DOING.

29:46.461 --> 29:46.980
GOOD LUCK.

29:46.980 --> 29:48.453
GOOD LUCK.

29:48.453 --> 29:49.484
THANK YOU.

29:49.484 --> 29:52.438
AFTER CHEF RAMSAY LEFT,
IT WAS JUST A DRAMATIC MESS.

29:52.438 --> 29:54.420
AMY, NO!
YOU FINISH!

29:54.420 --> 29:55.502
AMY AND SAMY THOUGHT
EVERYONE WAS OUT TO GET THEM.

29:55.502 --> 29:57.524
ATTITUDE I'VE
NEVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.

29:57.524 --> 29:58.555
THEY FIRED EVERYONE,

29:58.555 --> 30:00.517
TOLD EVERYONE THEY CAN DO
EVERYTHING ON THEIR OWN.

30:00.517 --> 30:02.440
THE NEXT DAY I WAS CALLED

30:02.440 --> 30:04.582
AND AMY AND SAMY
BEGGED FOR ME TO COME BACK.

30:04.582 --> 30:05.593
SO I DID.

30:05.593 --> 30:07.536
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

30:07.536 --> 30:10.509
SAMY AND AMY SAW
THAT I HAD TAKEN

30:10.509 --> 30:11.610
A $5 TIP
FROM MY CUSTOMER

30:11.610 --> 30:12.652
NO! NO!

30:12.652 --> 30:14.554
AND HAD A HUGE FIT OVER IT

30:14.554 --> 30:16.446
AND TOLD ME THAT I'M A THIEF
AND GET OUT OF HIS RESTAURANT.

30:16.446 --> 30:16.980
AND I THREW THE MONEY AT THEM,
AND I WALKED OUT

30:16.980 --> 30:18.518
AND I THREW THE MONEY AT THEM,
AND I WALKED OUT

30:18.518 --> 30:19.670
AND TOLD THEM,
"DON'T EVER TALK TO ME AGAIN.

30:19.670 --> 30:21.522
I'M DONE WITH THIS PLACE."

30:21.522 --> 30:23.524
A LOT OF MY FRIENDS
HAVE ACTUALLY GONE THERE

30:23.524 --> 30:24.666
JUST TO CHECK IT OUT,

30:24.666 --> 30:27.449
BECAUSE NOW
IT'S LIKE A TOURIST SITE.

30:27.449 --> 30:30.643
EVERYBODY WANTS TO SEE
IF AMY WAS ACTUALLY THAT CRAZY.

30:30.643 --> 30:33.516
WE HONESTLY WENT IN WITH,

30:33.516 --> 30:36.650
"LET'S SEE IF THE FOOD
IS REALLY AS PEOPLE SAY."

30:36.650 --> 30:39.503
ONE OF OUR FRIENDS
ORDERED A DRINK, GOT IT,

30:39.503 --> 30:41.605
AND NOTICED THAT THERE WAS
SOMETHING FLOATING IN THE DRINK.

30:41.605 --> 30:42.647
IT HAD THREE FRUIT FLIES
IN IT.

30:42.647 --> 30:44.589
WE CALLED SAMY OVER,

30:44.589 --> 30:46.551
AND HE GOT REALLY UPSET

30:46.551 --> 30:46.980
AND HE SAID,
"THERE ARE NO FLIES."

30:46.980 --> 30:48.523
AND HE SAID,
"THERE ARE NO FLIES."

30:48.523 --> 30:50.536
HE NEVER EVEN ACKNOWLEDGED
THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING WRONG.

30:50.536 --> 30:51.557
I SAID TO HIM,

30:51.557 --> 30:54.530
"WE DIDN'T BRING FLIES
IN OUR POCKETS WITH US."

30:54.530 --> 30:56.693
AND HE JUST SAID, "YOU HAVE
TO GO, YOU HAVE TO GO.

30:56.693 --> 30:58.515
YOU HAVE TO GO."

30:58.515 --> 31:00.567
WE THOUGHT THEY WOULD KIND OF
WANTING TO BE,

31:00.567 --> 31:03.601
YOU KNOW, PLEASING EVERYBODY AND
WANTING TO HAVE THE CUSTOMERS,

31:03.601 --> 31:04.692
AND, YOU KNOW--

31:04.692 --> 31:07.506
BUT THEY WERE EXACTLY
LIKE WE THOUGHT THEY WERE.

31:07.506 --> 31:09.568
THEY'RE TRYING TO CASH IN
ON THEIR NOTORIETY.

31:09.568 --> 31:11.590
IF YOU GO TO THEIR WEBSITE,

31:11.590 --> 31:12.682
THEY'RE SELLING T-SHIRTS

31:12.682 --> 31:15.625
THAT ARE PRINTED WITH LINES
FROM THE SHOW.

31:15.625 --> 31:16.980
IT'S NOT A CLASSY MOVE,

31:16.980 --> 31:17.537
IT'S NOT A CLASSY MOVE,

31:17.537 --> 31:18.659
BUT BECOMING
A TOURIST ATTRACTION

31:18.659 --> 31:20.571
WHERE THEY BASICALLY MAKE FUN
OF THEMSELVES,

31:20.571 --> 31:22.623
I THINK IT'S THE ONLY
FOR THEM TO SURVIVE.

31:22.623 --> 31:24.606
IT'S DEFINITELY
TURNED INTO A SPECTACLE

31:24.606 --> 31:25.657
THAT, IF YOU'RE IN THE AREA,

31:25.657 --> 31:28.590
YOU JUST HAVE TO SEE
WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.

31:28.590 --> 31:29.651
COMING UP...

31:29.651 --> 31:30.753
IT'S LIKE DISNEYLAND
FOR THE CRAZIES.

31:30.753 --> 31:32.555
IT'S LOUD...

31:32.555 --> 31:33.586
HE CAN KEEP HIS MENUS!

31:33.586 --> 31:34.607
IT'S INTENSE...

31:34.607 --> 31:35.608
WE DON'T GO DOWN
WITHOUT A FIGHT!

31:35.608 --> 31:36.640
IT'S SURPRISING.

31:36.640 --> 31:38.622
ARE WE BEING PUNK'D?

31:38.622 --> 31:40.534
IT'S OUR EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW
WITH SAMY AND AMY.

31:40.534 --> 31:41.605
I SEE ALL THE CRAZY.

31:41.605 --> 31:42.647
YOU WILL HEAR IT ALL...

31:42.647 --> 31:43.728
MY WIFE'S FOOD IS EXCELLENT.

31:43.728 --> 31:45.600
RAW AND UNCENSORED.

31:45.600 --> 31:46.980
HE WAS A PALE-FACED,
PANSY-ASS WILLOW.

31:46.980 --> 31:47.652
HE WAS A PALE-FACED,
PANSY-ASS WILLOW.

31:47.652 --> 31:49.645
WHEN OUR REPORTER ANA GARCIA...

31:49.645 --> 31:51.697
HAVE YOU CHANGED YOUR POLICY
ON THE TIPS?

31:51.697 --> 31:53.649
PAYS A VISIT
TO AMY'S BAKING COMPANY.

31:53.649 --> 31:55.562
I'M NOT GOING TO STOP.

31:55.562 --> 31:57.644
HOW--THEN I WILL BE A PANSY,
AND I'M NOT A PANSY.

32:08.567 --> 32:10.569
SHE DOESN'T LIKE
TO TAKE THE CRITICIZE,

32:10.569 --> 32:11.751
SHE LIKE TO TAKE
THE COMPLIMENTS.

32:11.751 --> 32:13.723
SHE CAN'T TAKE CRITICISM.
SHE CANNOT TAKE CRITICISM.

32:13.723 --> 32:16.756
HAVE YOU NOTICED,
WHEN SHE TALKS,

32:16.756 --> 32:18.679
SHE CAN'T STOP
BECAUSE SHE WON'T LISTEN?

32:18.679 --> 32:21.642
SO SHE'LL CONTINUE POUNDING
HER OWN VOICE

32:21.642 --> 32:23.624
RATHER THAN ACTUALLY LISTEN
TO CRITICISM.

32:23.624 --> 32:24.726
BUT WHEN IT'S A COMPLIMENT...
YEAH.

32:24.726 --> 32:25.817
"OH, MY GOD, IT'S AMAZING.
MY DESSERT'S AMA--"

32:25.817 --> 32:27.639
YEAH, YOU KNOW.
BUT THEN WHEN IT'S CRITICISM...

32:27.639 --> 32:28.700
YEAH.

32:28.700 --> 32:30.703
SO WHAT I'M ASKING,
WHY IS THAT?
OH.

32:30.703 --> 32:30.961
ASK HER THAT QUESTION.
ASK HER?

32:30.961 --> 32:31.794
ASK HER THAT QUESTION.
ASK HER?

32:31.794 --> 32:33.766
I HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM
FOR THAT.

32:33.766 --> 32:36.670
SHE CANNOT LISTEN CRITICISM.
OKAY, GOOD.

32:36.670 --> 32:37.791
GOOD. THANK YOU.
BUT SHE'S GOING
TO LISTEN TO ME.

32:37.791 --> 32:39.633
YEAH, SHE'S GOING TO. YES.

32:39.633 --> 32:40.734
BUT SHE'S NOT LISTENING.

32:40.734 --> 32:41.806
JUST A BLANK THERE.

32:41.806 --> 32:42.827
DO YOU KNOW WHY--
SHE'S NOT LISTENING.

32:42.827 --> 32:44.719
I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW.

32:44.719 --> 32:46.661
I HAVE THAT PROBLEM
FOR TEN YEARS.
RIGHT, THANK YOU. OKAY.

32:46.661 --> 32:47.793
OKAY?

32:49.845 --> 32:53.619
SO FAR, WE'VE SHOWN YOU
SOME INCREDIBLE UNSEEN FOOTAGE

32:53.619 --> 32:54.801
AND BROUGHT YOU UP TO DATE
ON WHAT'S HAPPENED

32:54.801 --> 32:56.643
SINCE THIS EPISODE AIRED.

32:56.643 --> 32:58.775
BUT NOW IT'S TIME TO HEAR
FROM THE OWNERS THEMSELVES.

32:58.775 --> 33:00.961
HERE IS OUR REPORTER ANA GARCIA
WITH AMY AND SAMY.

33:00.961 --> 33:02.640
HERE IS OUR REPORTER ANA GARCIA
WITH AMY AND SAMY.

33:07.796 --> 33:10.830
HI, SAMY. ANA GARCIA
FROM <i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARES.</i>

33:10.830 --> 33:12.662
HOW ARE YOU?
<i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARE?</i>

33:12.662 --> 33:14.674
YES!
OH! GOOD, YES.

33:14.674 --> 33:15.795
CAN WE COME--
CAN WE COME IN AND TALK?

33:15.795 --> 33:16.847
OF COURSE
YOU CAN COME IN, YES.

33:16.847 --> 33:17.868
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.

33:17.868 --> 33:19.680
PLEASE COME IN HERE.
I APPRECIATE IT.

33:19.680 --> 33:21.682
YES.
LET ME INTRODUCE MYSELF.

33:21.682 --> 33:23.715
HI. ANA GARCIA
FROM <i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARES.</i>

33:23.715 --> 33:24.836
VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.
HI.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.888
WE WANNA CATCH UP
WITH YOU AND SAMY.

33:26.888 --> 33:28.851
DO YOU HAVE
A FEW MINUTES FOR US?

33:28.851 --> 33:30.961
<i>GIVE ME SOME MONEY,</i>
<i>OR YOU COME WANT TO TALK TO ME?</i>

33:30.961 --> 33:31.664
<i>GIVE ME SOME MONEY,</i>
<i>OR YOU COME WANT TO TALK TO ME?</i>

33:31.664 --> 33:32.785
I'D LOVE TO TALK WITH YOU.

33:32.785 --> 33:33.846
NO, YOU TALK TO ME
AND I WANT MONEY.

33:33.846 --> 33:35.679
BECAUSE THIS TIME
FROM <i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARE,</i>

33:35.679 --> 33:36.820
I WANT MONEY.

33:36.820 --> 33:39.683
YOU GUYS DID MAKE SO MUCH MONEY
BECAUSE OF US,

33:39.683 --> 33:42.687
AND GORDON RAMSAY TRIED
TO BURY ME ALIVE.

33:42.687 --> 33:43.908
OR HE WANTS.
I WILL BURY HIM FIRST.

33:43.908 --> 33:46.882
I WILL BURY HIM FIRST AND BURY
YOUR <i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARE</i> ALSO,

33:46.882 --> 33:48.854
BECAUSE YOU DID IT ON PURPOSE.

33:48.854 --> 33:50.886
YOU SET ME UP
AND THIS IS WHAT YOU DID.

33:50.886 --> 33:53.740
YOU TRIED TO BURY US ALIVE.
ALIVE.

33:53.740 --> 33:56.733
AND YOU DIDN'T DO YET,
AND I WON'T LET NOBODY TO DO IT.

33:56.733 --> 33:58.745
WELL, WILL YOU SIT DOWN
AND TALK WITH US, SAMY...

33:58.745 --> 33:59.897
YES, PLEASE.
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED...

33:59.897 --> 34:00.961
<i>AND EVERYTHING</i>
<i>THAT'S HAPPENED?</i>

34:00.961 --> 34:01.759
<i>AND EVERYTHING</i>
<i>THAT'S HAPPENED?</i>

34:01.759 --> 34:02.860
<i>GORDON RAMSAY</i>
<i>CAN GO  HIMSELF.</i>

34:02.860 --> 34:04.863
BECAUSE HE WAS NOT FAIR.
HE WAS NOT FAIR.

34:04.863 --> 34:05.934
<i>HOW WAS HE NOT FAIR, SAMY?</i>

34:05.934 --> 34:07.746
HE WAS NOT FAIR
BECAUSE HE SHOULDN'T--

34:07.746 --> 34:08.847
SAMY, STOP TALKING.

34:08.847 --> 34:09.868
IT'S OKAY, HONEY, YEAH.

34:09.868 --> 34:12.732
BECAUSE HE SHOULDN'T
REPRESENT US THAT WAY.

34:12.732 --> 34:13.903
<i>I AM GOING TO GO AGAINST</i>
<i>FOLKS,</i>

34:13.903 --> 34:15.925
AGAINST GORDON RAMSAY,
<i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARE--</i>

34:15.925 --> 34:17.778
<i>LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING.</i>

34:17.778 --> 34:18.889
OKAY.
LET ME SHOW YOU THIS.

34:18.889 --> 34:19.880
SO I POSTED--
<i>TO WRECK ME,</i>
<i>TO WRECK MY WIFE.</i>

34:19.880 --> 34:20.911
SAMY?
<i>TO COME TO KILL ME.</i>

34:20.911 --> 34:22.864
WHO IS HE?
HE HAS NO BALLS!

34:22.864 --> 34:24.886
HE'S JEALOUS OF MY BALLS!!

34:24.886 --> 34:26.868
THIS IS WHAT HE IS.
<i>WE WERE MADE TO LOOK...</i>

34:26.868 --> 34:29.822
LIKE THE MOST PSYCHOTIC,
LUNATIC PEOPLE IN THE UNIVERSE.

34:29.822 --> 34:30.961
AND AFTER WATCHING
<i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARES,</i>

34:30.961 --> 34:30.963
AND AFTER WATCHING
<i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARES,</i>

34:30.963 --> 34:32.825
I SEE ALL THE CRAZY.

34:32.825 --> 34:33.876
BUT I DON'T SEE
ANY OF THE GOOD.

34:33.876 --> 34:35.899
I KNOW THE PEOPLE THAT CAME HERE
WERE YELPERS

34:35.899 --> 34:37.861
BECAUSE I HAVE PROOF OF IT.

34:37.861 --> 34:39.783
THEY WERE ON YELP
TALKING ABOUT IT

34:39.783 --> 34:41.946
AFTER THEY WERE FILMING AND
BEFORE THEY WERE COMING HERE.

34:41.946 --> 34:44.819
THIS IS NOT STUFF
THAT I'VE INVENTED.

34:44.819 --> 34:46.782
I'M NOT DELUSIONAL,
I'M NOT CRAZY.

34:46.782 --> 34:47.863
YES, WE ARE PASSIONATE.

34:47.863 --> 34:48.964
YES, WE ARE WILD.

34:48.964 --> 34:51.918
IF I CAME AFTER YOU,
YOU WOULD PROBABLY STAND UP TOO.

34:51.918 --> 34:53.910
IF I CAME AFTER ANYBODY ELSE,
YOU WOULD DEFEND YOURSELF,

34:53.910 --> 34:54.991
WOULDN'T YOU?

34:54.991 --> 34:56.853
IF YOU HAVE A FAMILY,
WOUDLN'T YOU DEFEND IT?

34:56.853 --> 34:57.904
HAS IT BEEN STRESSFUL?

34:57.904 --> 34:59.937
STRESSFUL? YES.
IT'S BEEN VERY STRESSFUL.

34:59.937 --> 35:00.961
WE'VE HAD PEOPLE
WALK THROUGH MY DOORS,

35:00.961 --> 35:02.770
WE'VE HAD PEOPLE
WALK THROUGH MY DOORS,

35:02.770 --> 35:04.923
COME CASUALLY OVER HERE
LIKE THIS,

35:04.923 --> 35:06.995
WALK OVER,
LOOK AT THE DISPLAY CASE.

35:06.995 --> 35:09.929
KEEP GOING LIKE THIS,
AND THEN LEAVE.

35:09.929 --> 35:11.921
AND THEN MY WAITRESS
COMES UP TO ME.

35:11.921 --> 35:12.962
NOW WE HAVE WAITRESSES

35:12.962 --> 35:14.984
BECAUSE WE HAD TO CHANGE
OUR WHOLE PROCEDURE.

35:14.984 --> 35:16.837
BECAUSE THE WHOLE UNIVERSE
THOUGHT MY HUSBAND

35:16.837 --> 35:17.938
WAS STEALING THEIR TIPS.

35:17.938 --> 35:18.979
SO WE TRIED SOMETHING NEW.

35:18.979 --> 35:20.861
I TOOK ALL
OF THE NEGATIVE THINGS

35:20.861 --> 35:23.955
THAT GORDON RAMSAY SAID
AND I TRIED TO IMPROVE ON IT.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.807
<i>THAT'S WHY</i>
<i>I HAD HIM COME HERE.</i>

35:25.807 --> 35:27.018
PEOPLE COME HERE
TO TRY TO SET US UP

35:27.018 --> 35:28.891
BECAUSE THEY THINK IT'S FUN

35:28.891 --> 35:30.803
AND 'CAUSE THEY HAVE A
FOR GORDON RAMSAY.

35:30.803 --> 35:30.961
<i>THERE WAS ONE PERSON,</i>
<i>HE LEFT ON THIS PLATE--</i>

35:30.961 --> 35:32.915
<i>THERE WAS ONE PERSON,</i>
<i>HE LEFT ON THIS PLATE--</i>

35:32.915 --> 35:33.957
AND I HAVE IT IN MY OFFICE,

35:33.957 --> 35:36.009
AND I HAVE THE SURVEILLANCE
CAMERA PROOF OF IT--

35:36.009 --> 35:37.951
HE PUTS A GIANT
RUBBER COCKROACH ON THE PLATE

35:37.951 --> 35:39.012
AND LEFT IT THERE,

35:39.012 --> 35:41.015
LEFT WITHOUT BUYING A CAKE,
AND THOUGHT THAT THAT WAS FUNNY.

35:41.015 --> 35:42.957
WE ARE DEALING WITH THAT
DAILY.

35:42.957 --> 35:44.018
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK HERE.

35:44.018 --> 35:45.840
WE STOOD UP TO GORDON RAMSAY,

35:45.840 --> 35:47.032
WE'RE GONNA STAND UP
TO THE WORLD!

35:47.032 --> 35:49.865
'CAUSE WE DON'T GO DOWN
WITHOUT A FIGHT.

35:49.865 --> 35:50.976
WE HAVE TO SHOW THE WORLD,

35:50.976 --> 35:53.880
AND EVERY SINGLE
BUSINESS OWNER OUT THERE,

35:53.880 --> 35:54.981
THAT YOU HAVE TO STAND UP.

35:54.981 --> 35:57.054
YOU CANNOT LET ANYONE
SHAKE YOU DOWN.

35:57.054 --> 35:59.046
WE HAVE A VOICE,
HE HAS A VOICE,

35:59.046 --> 36:00.961
AND IT'S UP TO US
TO STAY STRONG

36:00.961 --> 36:01.028
AND IT'S UP TO US
TO STAY STRONG

36:01.028 --> 36:04.032
AND TO SHOW OUR TRUE PRODUCT
AND WHAT WE REALLY HAVE

36:04.032 --> 36:09.018
TO OFFER HERE AT AMY'S BAKING
COMPANY, AND THAT'S IT!

36:09.018 --> 36:10.059
COMING UP...

36:10.059 --> 36:12.041
I'M NOT GOING TO STOP.

36:12.041 --> 36:13.913
JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT
IT COULDN'T GET MORE INTENSE...

36:13.913 --> 36:15.045
THAT, TO ME,
SHOWS ME THAT HE'S A PANSY.

36:15.045 --> 36:18.008
THERE ARE MORE SHOCKING MOMENTS
FROM AMY AND SAMY.

36:18.008 --> 36:20.891
NOW YOU HAVE LIT THE FIRE
INSIDE OF US.

36:33.987 --> 36:35.899
IF THIS BUSINESS
WERE TO BE SUCCESSFUL,

36:35.899 --> 36:39.003
IN MY OPINION, YOU NEED
TO CLONE ME, THREE TIMES.

36:39.003 --> 36:41.886
CLONE SAMY THREE TIMES,
CLONE ME THREE TIMES,

36:41.886 --> 36:42.977
AND I'LL BE PERFECT.

36:42.977 --> 36:44.038
ALL THE AMY CLONES
WOULD JUST START,

36:44.038 --> 36:45.901
LIKE, KILLING OFF
EACH OTHER.

36:45.901 --> 36:47.042
THEY'D JUST GET SO SICK
OF EACH OTHER.

36:47.042 --> 36:49.064
LIKE, ONE THING
ANOTHER AMY SAID,

36:49.064 --> 36:51.057
LIKE, YOU CAN'T MIX TWO AMYS.

36:51.057 --> 36:52.899
IT DOESN'T DO ANYTHING.

36:52.899 --> 36:54.891
IN A MOMENT, I'LL SHARE WITH YOU
MY FINAL THOUGHTS

36:54.891 --> 36:55.111
IN A MOMENT, I'LL SHARE WITH YOU
MY FINAL THOUGHTS

36:55.111 --> 36:57.014
ON AMY'S BAKING COMPANY.

36:57.014 --> 36:58.986
BUT FIRST,
LET'S HEAD BACK TO SCOTTSDALE

36:58.986 --> 37:02.960
AND OUR REPORTER ANA GARCIA
WHO'S WITH SAMY AND AMY.

37:02.960 --> 37:05.123
HOW WAS YOUR BUSINESS AFFECTED
BY WHAT HAPPENED IN THE EPISODE?

37:05.123 --> 37:09.148
WE WERE COMPLETELY BOMBARDED
BY THE MEDIA, BY CUSTOMERS,

37:09.148 --> 37:10.990
BY HATERS, BY TROLLS.

37:10.990 --> 37:12.942
WE'VE BECOME THE NUMBER-ONE
TOURIST ATTRACTION

37:12.942 --> 37:14.134
FOR THE SUMMER,

37:14.134 --> 37:16.937
ONLY IT'S LIKE DISNEYLAND
FOR THE CRAZIES.

37:16.937 --> 37:18.028
THEY STAND OUTSIDE
AND TAKE PICTURES

37:18.028 --> 37:19.089
JUST BECAUSE
THEY WANNA SEE US.

37:19.089 --> 37:21.112
WHEN THEY COME IN, THEY LOOK
AT US LIKE, "THEY <i>ARE</i> REAL."

37:21.112 --> 37:22.994
AND THEY ALMOST PASS OUT.

37:22.994 --> 37:24.125
AND THEN THEY SIT DOWN
AND THEY TRY OUR FOOD...

37:24.125 --> 37:24.891
<i>MM-HMM.</i>

37:24.891 --> 37:25.987
<i>MM-HMM.</i>

37:25.987 --> 37:27.169
AND THEY SEE
WHO WE ARE AS PEOPLE,

37:27.169 --> 37:29.031
AND THEY SAY,
"I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

37:29.031 --> 37:30.953
"IT'S AMAZING!
YOUR FOOD'S INCREDIBLE!

37:30.953 --> 37:32.054
"HOW DID THIS EVER HAPPEN?

37:32.054 --> 37:33.997
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
ARE WE BEING PUNK'D?"

37:33.997 --> 37:35.108
BUT HAVE YOU BEEN BUSY?

37:35.108 --> 37:38.152
WE REALLY DIDN'T FIND ANYONE WHO
EVER SAID THIS PLACE WAS PACKED.

37:38.152 --> 37:40.144
WELL, I'M OPEN FOR BUSINESS
RIGHT NOW.

37:40.144 --> 37:42.987
LOOK--HOW CAN I HAVE
ANY NORMAL BUSINESS

37:42.987 --> 37:44.139
WHEN I HAVE THIS
ALL DAY LONG?

37:44.139 --> 37:46.021
<i>WHAT HAPPENED WITH FACEBOOK?</i>

37:46.021 --> 37:47.993
<i>WITH THE ALLEGATIONS</i>
<i>THAT YOU HAD BEEN HACKED?</i>

37:47.993 --> 37:50.005
<i>EVERY SINGLE POST</i>
<i>THAT WAS WRITTEN--</i>

37:50.005 --> 37:52.158
CALLING PEOPLE
AND MAKING FUN OF THEM

37:52.158 --> 37:54.110
FOR NOT MAKING MONEY--
DID NOT COME FROM US.

37:54.110 --> 37:54.891
<i>WE DIDN'T SAY THOSE THINGS.</i>

37:54.891 --> 37:55.171
<i>WE DIDN'T SAY THOSE THINGS.</i>

37:55.171 --> 37:57.004
NOW WE ARE,

37:57.004 --> 37:59.126
BECAUSE NOW YOU HAVE LIT
THE FIRE INSIDE OF US.

37:59.126 --> 38:01.999
<i>NOW, WHEN WE'RE CALLING PEOPLE</i>
<i>"LITTLE TROLLS"</i>

38:01.999 --> 38:03.161
AND TELLING THEM
THAT THEY HAVE NO BALLS,

38:03.161 --> 38:05.173
YES, THAT'S US.
OKAY.

38:05.173 --> 38:07.145
BECAUSE I THINK IT TAKES
A VERY SPECIAL KIND OF PERSON--

38:07.145 --> 38:09.148
IT'S CALLED A "EUNICH"--
TO BE ABLE TO CALL SOMEONE

38:09.148 --> 38:11.100
AND BULLY THEM OVER THE PHONE
OR THROUGH THE INTERNET,

38:11.100 --> 38:12.181
WHEN YOU DON'T KNOW
WHO THEY ARE.

38:12.181 --> 38:15.015
NOBODY MAKE MONEY
BECAUSE THOSE TROLLS.

38:15.015 --> 38:18.148
BECAUSE GORDON RAMSAY TOLD THEM
I'M STEALING TIPS TO THE PEOPLE

38:18.148 --> 38:19.149
AND IT'S NOT TRUE.
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THAT?

38:19.149 --> 38:20.231
YEAH.
CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE TIPS?

38:20.231 --> 38:22.193
I WAS
PRETTY SURPRISED...
YEAH.

38:22.193 --> 38:24.215
THAT THE WAITRESSES
DIDN'T KEEP THEIR TIPS.

38:24.215 --> 38:24.891
YEAH.
<i>WHY, SAMY?</i>

38:24.891 --> 38:26.017
YEAH.
<i>WHY, SAMY?</i>

38:26.017 --> 38:28.050
BECAUSE I GIVE THEM HOURLY
VERY HIGH.

38:28.050 --> 38:29.211
I DON'T GIVE THEM--
HOW HIGH?

38:29.211 --> 38:32.125
BETWEEN $8 TO $14 AN HOUR.

38:32.125 --> 38:34.147
IF IT'S EMPTY LIKE THIS,
THEY STILL GO WITH MONEY.

38:34.147 --> 38:35.178
IF THEY WAIT FOR THE TIP,

38:35.178 --> 38:37.090
THEY WAIT LIKE THIS.

38:37.090 --> 38:38.172
HAVE YOU CHANGED YOUR POLICY
ON THE TIPS?

38:38.172 --> 38:39.193
I DID CHANGE.
I GIVE THEM TIPS.

38:39.193 --> 38:41.075
<i>SO IS THAT SOMETHING GOOD</i>
<i>THAT CAME OUT</i>

38:41.075 --> 38:42.186
<i>OF THE</i> KITCHEN NIGHTMARES,
<i>IS THAT YOU NOW--</i>

38:42.186 --> 38:43.177
NO, IT'S NO GOOD.

38:43.177 --> 38:44.219
<i>BECAUSE THEY WORK</i>
<i>FOR THE TIP,</i>

38:44.219 --> 38:46.201
AND THERE IS NOBODY HERE,

38:46.201 --> 38:47.222
THEN OF COURSE
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE MONEY

38:47.222 --> 38:48.243
IN THEIR OWN WAY.

38:48.243 --> 38:50.096
ALL OF THIS THAT'S HAPPENED

38:50.096 --> 38:52.058
YOU KNOW,
HAVE YOU MADE ANY CHANGES

38:52.058 --> 38:53.099
<i>TO THE MENU?</i>

38:53.099 --> 38:54.170
HE CAN KEEP HIS MENUS!

38:54.170 --> 38:54.891
HIS MENU, CAN KEEP IT
FOR HIS OWN RESTAURANT.

38:54.891 --> 38:56.062
HIS MENU, CAN KEEP IT
FOR HIS OWN RESTAURANT.

38:56.062 --> 38:57.114
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE RAVIOLIS?

38:57.114 --> 38:58.165
ARE THE RAVIOLIS
STILL FROZEN?

38:58.165 --> 39:00.057
YEAH, STILL FROZEN.
YES, STILL FROZEN, YEAH.

39:00.057 --> 39:01.249
AND THEY'RE EXCELLENT!
WAIT, LISTEN.

39:01.249 --> 39:04.252
GORDON RAMSAY ALSO,
DURING THE FILMING, I ASKED HIM.

39:04.252 --> 39:06.254
I SAID, "WOULD YOU LET ANYBODY
COME INTO YOUR KITCHEN

39:06.254 --> 39:09.168
H"AND GIVE YOU THE KIND
OF ATTITUDE THAT KATY GAVE ME

39:09.168 --> 39:11.140
AND NOT FIRE THEM?"
HE SAID, "YEAH."

39:11.140 --> 39:13.182
THAT, TO ME,
SHOWS ME THAT HE'S A PANSY.

39:13.182 --> 39:15.095
IF SOME--I STAND UP
TO EVERYTHING IN MY KITCHEN.

39:15.095 --> 39:17.207
OH, YOU GOT CRITICIZED
FOR USING THAT WORD, AMY.

39:17.207 --> 39:18.288
THE REASON
I SAID HE WAS A PANSY

39:18.288 --> 39:20.231
IS BECAUSE THE SAME REASON
I CALL THESE YELPERS

39:20.231 --> 39:22.133
AND THESE PEOPLE THAT HIDE
BEHIND THE COMPUTER SCREEN

39:22.133 --> 39:23.214
"THE  MAFIA."

39:23.214 --> 39:24.255
THEY ARE ,
THEY ARE PANSIES.

39:24.255 --> 39:24.891
THEY HAVE NO BALLS.

39:24.891 --> 39:26.128
THEY HAVE NO BALLS.

39:26.128 --> 39:28.080
BECAUSE IF THEY HAD BALLS,
THEY WOULD COME TO MY FACE,

39:28.080 --> 39:30.292
MY HUSBAND'S FACE, AND TELL US
EXACTLY ALL THIS STUFF--

39:30.292 --> 39:32.285
THE LIES, THE SLANDEROUS STUFF
THAT THEY SAY ONLINE--

39:32.285 --> 39:34.277
INSTEAD OF JUST HIDING
BEHIND THEIR COMPUTER SCREEN.

39:34.277 --> 39:36.239
I HAVE SAID A LOT
OF OFFENSIVE THINGS,

39:36.239 --> 39:39.263
<i>BUT WHEN A PERSON</i>
<i>IS COMPLETELY UNDER ATTACKED--</i>

39:39.263 --> 39:42.186
I'M SORRY, I WOULD LOVE
TO BE NOTHING BUT A LADY

39:42.186 --> 39:45.120
AND CONTROL MY LANGUAGE
AND NOT HAVE A SEVERE CASE

39:45.120 --> 39:48.103
OF TOURETTE'S SYNDROME, BUT
THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ME

39:48.103 --> 39:49.265
BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE.

39:49.265 --> 39:51.297
I CALLED THAT GUY A PANSY
BECAUSE HE WAS

39:51.297 --> 39:53.159
A PALE-FACED,
PANSY-ASS WILLOW.

39:53.159 --> 39:54.280
THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I CALLED HIM.

39:54.280 --> 39:54.891
YES, I'M GOING TO SAY THINGS
IF SOMEONE ATTACKS ME.

39:54.891 --> 39:57.244
YES, I'M GOING TO SAY THINGS
IF SOMEONE ATTACKS ME.

39:57.244 --> 39:59.176
I'M NOT GOING TO STOP.

39:59.176 --> 40:01.239
HOW--THEN I WILL BE A PANSY,
AND I'M NOT A PANSY.

40:01.239 --> 40:03.241
THERE WAS A PART
IN THE EPISODE

40:03.241 --> 40:05.233
<i>WHERE IT SHOWED</i>

40:05.233 --> 40:08.287
THAT SAMY TRIES
TO SHIELD YOU FROM CRITICISM.

40:08.287 --> 40:11.290
AND WHEN GORDON SENT BACK
SOME FOOD, SAMY,

40:11.290 --> 40:13.253
YOU DIDN'T REALLY
WANNA TELL AMY.

40:13.253 --> 40:14.334
<i>TELL HER WHY.</i>
BECAUSE IT'S NOT TRUE!

40:14.334 --> 40:17.327
BECAUSE MY WIFE'S FOOD
IS EXCELLENT.

40:17.327 --> 40:19.190
<i>EVERYBODY LOVE</i>
<i>MY WIFE'S FOOD.</i>

40:19.190 --> 40:21.162
<i>THE REASON THAT HE</i>
<i>DIDN'T TELL ME</i>

40:21.162 --> 40:23.164
EACH PLATE WAS GETTING
SENT BACK IS BECAUSE

40:23.164 --> 40:24.891
HE KNEW THAT GORDON RAMSAY
WAS FULL OF.

40:24.891 --> 40:25.327
HE KNEW THAT GORDON RAMSAY
WAS FULL OF.

40:25.327 --> 40:27.279
<i>SAMY TELLS EVERYTHING TO ME</i>

40:27.279 --> 40:29.301
AS I TELL EVERYTHING TO SAMY.

40:29.301 --> 40:31.324
WE SHARE, WE DON'T KEEP
SECRETS FROM EACH OTHER.

40:31.324 --> 40:33.296
<i>HE PROTECTS ME.</i>
<i>I PROTECT HIM.</i>

40:33.296 --> 40:36.159
PEOPLE LOVE US BECAUSE WE STAND
TOGETHER AND WE ARE UNITED.

40:36.159 --> 40:38.312
<i>YES, HE AND I WILL FIGHT</i>
<i>TO THE DEATH</i>

40:38.312 --> 40:39.333
FOR EACH OTHER, NO DOUBT.

40:39.333 --> 40:41.235
YOU COME AND YOU TRY
TO ATTACK US,

40:41.235 --> 40:42.327
I'M GOING TO BE A LIKE
A FIERCE LION.

40:42.327 --> 40:44.349
<i>I'M GONNA ATTACK ANYBODY</i>
<i>THAT'S COMING</i>

40:44.349 --> 40:46.231
TO TRY TO HURT MY HUSBAND
OR MY BUSINESS.

40:46.231 --> 40:47.362
<i>IT HAS AFFECTED YOUR BUSINESS.</i>

40:47.362 --> 40:49.345
ARE YOU SEEING THE CUSTOMERS
COME BACK?

40:49.345 --> 40:51.387
NO, NO.
DIFFERENT, DIFFERENT PEOPLE.

40:51.387 --> 40:53.309
YOU KNOW, DIFFERENT PEOPLE,
THEY COME,

40:53.309 --> 40:54.891
THEY ARE VERY HAPPY,
SURPRISED,

40:54.891 --> 40:55.322
THEY ARE VERY HAPPY,
SURPRISED,

40:55.322 --> 40:57.204
SURPRISED WHAT
GORDON RAMSAY SAY.

40:57.204 --> 41:00.298
<i>I HAVE ENOUGH MONEY</i>
<i>TO KEEP MY BUSINESS</i>

41:00.298 --> 41:02.360
AS LONG TILL THE STUPID PEOPLE
BECOME SMART

41:02.360 --> 41:04.352
AND THEN THEY COME AGAIN TO US,
AND THEY WILL.

41:04.352 --> 41:07.366
WE ARE NOT THE ONES
GORDON RAMSAY RESPRESENT US.

41:07.366 --> 41:09.318
WE ARE NOT AT ALL.

41:09.318 --> 41:12.282
WE'RE NOT A VILLAIN
OR GANGSTER OR WHAT.

41:12.282 --> 41:14.234
I AM REFORMED.
I GIVE UP LONG AGO.

41:14.234 --> 41:15.335
<i>BUT YOU DID SAY--</i>

41:15.335 --> 41:17.347
YOU DID SAY TO GORDON...
YES, YEAH, I SHOWED HIM.

41:17.347 --> 41:18.369
"I'M A GANGSTER."
I MEAN, YOU DID SAY THAT.

41:18.369 --> 41:19.380
WELL, I WOULD SAY IT AGAIN.

41:19.380 --> 41:21.342
I WILL SAY IT AGAIN
IF SOMEBODY--

41:21.342 --> 41:23.314
BECAUSE I AM THE ONE
WHO CAN GO ON TOP OF HIM.

41:23.314 --> 41:24.891
HE CANNOT GO ON TOP OF ME.
I CAN PROMISE YOU.

41:24.891 --> 41:25.257
HE CANNOT GO ON TOP OF ME.
I CAN PROMISE YOU.

41:25.257 --> 41:27.309
NOT HIM, NOT ALL THESE PEOPLE.
I CAN PROMISE YOU.

41:27.309 --> 41:29.261
BUT YOU DID SAY THAT, SAMY.
I DID SAY IT,

41:29.261 --> 41:30.363
AND I WILL SAY IT AGAIN
IF I HAVE TO.

41:30.363 --> 41:32.365
OKAY.
I WILL SAY IT.

41:32.365 --> 41:34.317
MYSELF, I WOULD LIKE PEOPLE
TO UNDERSTAND

41:34.317 --> 41:36.330
THAT FIRST AND FOREMOST,
MY HUSBAND AND I,

41:36.330 --> 41:39.433
WE ARE UNITED, AND THAT'S THE
MOST WONDERFUL THING IN MY LIFE.

41:39.433 --> 41:42.367
WE ARE NOT PSYCHOTIC,
LUNATIC PEOPLE

41:42.367 --> 41:44.429
THAT WILL MAKE YOU WAIT
AN HOUR AND A HALF FOR YOUR FOOD

41:44.429 --> 41:46.371
AND THEN CALL THE POLICE ON YOU
IF YOU DON'T GET IT.

41:46.371 --> 41:48.243
<i>WE'RE NOT GONNA SCREAM AT YOU</i>
<i>AND THROW YOU OUT</i>

41:48.243 --> 41:49.395
<i>UNLESS YOU COME TO ATTACK US.</i>

41:49.395 --> 41:51.257
IF YOU DO COME AND ATTACK US,
WE WILL SCREAM AT YOU

41:51.257 --> 41:52.278
AND WE WILL THROW YOU OUT.

41:52.278 --> 41:54.261
<i>I THINK, LIKE,</i>
<i>95% OF THE THINGS</i>

41:54.261 --> 41:54.891
THAT ARE BEING SAID ABOUT US,
WE SIT AND WE LAUGH

41:54.891 --> 41:55.422
THAT ARE BEING SAID ABOUT US,
WE SIT AND WE LAUGH

41:55.422 --> 41:58.275
OUR BUTTS OFF ABOUT IT
BECAUSE IT'S HYSTERICAL.

41:58.275 --> 41:59.487
<i>DO YOU HAVE A MESSAGE</i>
<i>FOR GORDON RAMSAY?</i>

41:59.487 --> 42:02.420
MR. RAMSAY, FOR ALL THE RESPECT
THAT I HAD FOR YOU,

42:02.420 --> 42:04.342
I ASK YOU NOW TO REALLY
PUT THE TRUTH

42:04.342 --> 42:05.454
AND REALLY GIVE US A CHANCE.

42:05.454 --> 42:07.266
REALLY GIVE US A CHANCE--

42:07.266 --> 42:08.417
WHO IS HE TO GIVE YOU
A CHANCE?

42:08.417 --> 42:09.468
'CAUSE HE TRIED TO DESTROY US.

42:09.468 --> 42:11.431
HE HAS CONTROL
OF THESE CAMERAS, SAMY.

42:11.431 --> 42:13.273
- HE DOESN'T GIVE US CHANCE.
- EVERYBODY.

42:13.273 --> 42:14.364
HE HAS CONTROL
OVER THESE CAMERAS.
COME ON.

42:14.364 --> 42:15.465
WHAT CHANCE?
THEY EDITED US.

42:15.465 --> 42:17.418
I NEED HIM TO GIVE ME
A CHANCE?
WELL, OBVIOUSLY!

42:17.418 --> 42:19.280
THE WHOLE WORLD THINKS
THAT WE'RE PSYCHOTIC

42:19.280 --> 42:20.381
BECAUSE THE WAY
THAT THEY EDITED US.
HE KILLED YOU ALREADY.

42:20.381 --> 42:21.512
HE KILLED YOU ALREADY!
YOU THINK HE'S GOING TO COME

42:21.512 --> 42:23.475
AND SAY, "NO, THE FOOD IS GOOD.
I WAS JOKING"?

42:23.475 --> 42:24.891
YEAH, I THINK HE SHOULD
DO THAT...
YEAH.

42:24.891 --> 42:25.357
YEAH, I THINK HE SHOULD
DO THAT...
YEAH.

42:25.357 --> 42:26.438
IF HE'S
A RESPONSIBLE PERSON.
NO, HE WON'T DO THAT, AMY.

42:26.438 --> 42:28.310
YOU'RE ASKING TOO MUCH.
HE CAN'T.

42:28.310 --> 42:29.422
IT'S LIKE HE'S GOING
TO SAY THAT

42:29.422 --> 42:30.463
AND HE'S GOING
TO CLOSE THE STORE.

42:30.463 --> 42:32.415
THAT'S IT. FINISHED.
HE'S FINISHED.

42:32.415 --> 42:33.466
<i>I'M ASKING FOR THE TRUTH.</i>
HE WON'T DO THAT.

42:33.466 --> 42:35.338
<i>THAT'S IT.</i>
HE WILL NEVER SAY THE TRUTH.

42:35.338 --> 42:37.421
OF COURSE HE WILL KEEP IT,
THE TRUTH, FOR HIMSELF.

42:41.406 --> 42:43.518
SAVING RESTAURANTS AND HELPING
FAMILIES ON <i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARES</i>

42:43.518 --> 42:45.338
IS AN INCREDIBLY
GRATIFYING EXPERIENCE.

42:45.338 --> 42:47.208
I LOOK FORWARD
TO EVERY CHALLENGE

42:47.208 --> 42:49.248
AND I TAKE EACH MISSION
VERY SERIOUSLY.

42:49.248 --> 42:52.208
WHAT HAPPENED IN SCOTTSDALE WAS
ACTUALLY QUITE DISAPPOINTING.

42:52.208 --> 42:54.228
MY TEAM AND I HAD
A FANTASTIC PLAN

42:54.228 --> 42:54.891
TO HELP AMY'S BAKING COMPANY.

42:54.891 --> 42:55.338
TO HELP AMY'S BAKING COMPANY.

42:55.338 --> 42:59.248
UNFORTUNATELY, THE OWNERS HAD
NO INTEREST IN HEARING IT.

42:59.248 --> 43:02.248
GOOD NIGHT.
