00:10.189 --> 00:13.024
<i>Almost through Round</i>
<i>Number One, and it is</i>

00:13.092 --> 00:14.859
still anybody's fight.

00:14.927 --> 00:19.397
<i>Whoever wins will contend for</i>
<i>a spot in the FLC Heavyweight</i>

00:19.464 --> 00:21.266
<i>Championship of the World.</i>
<i>There it is! Yeah!</i>

00:21.333 --> 00:23.935
Will it be the hottest rising
<i>star in Mixed Martial Arts,</i>

00:24.003 --> 00:27.637
<i>23-year-old local boy Scotty</i>
<i>The Fighting Furmanek?</i>

00:27.705 --> 00:30.040
- All right, Scotty!
- Or will rival Diego Lightning

00:30.108 --> 00:32.109
<i>Baptiste have something to say</i>
<i>about that?</i>

00:34.845 --> 00:37.447
- Ooh!
- Get off the fence!

00:39.884 --> 00:42.084
- There ya go!
- The Fighting Furmanek Clan

00:42.152 --> 00:45.888
<i>- watching cage-side.
- That's what I'm talking about!</i>

00:48.625 --> 00:51.593
- Oh!
- You're all over him. You're all over him.

00:51.661 --> 00:54.130
<i>Legendary Taekwondo Master</i>

00:54.197 --> 00:56.299
<i>Joe Furmanek must be looking
down from the heavens right now,</i>

00:56.366 --> 00:58.333
<i>very proud of his son.</i>

01:00.903 --> 01:02.770
OK, take it easy.
This is good. He's doing good.

01:02.838 --> 01:05.307
That's it. Break.

01:05.373 --> 01:07.309
<i>And we come to the end</i>

01:07.376 --> 01:09.577
of what is a very entertaining
Round Number One.

01:11.680 --> 01:15.449
- OK, take a seat, take a seat.
- That's it now. Settle down, settle down.

01:15.516 --> 01:16.737
Scotty's got it in the bag.

01:16.885 --> 01:18.853
Oh, yeah. The man is
a master strategist.

01:18.921 --> 01:20.788
OK, when you look
at that bloodbath, you see

01:20.856 --> 01:23.624
- strategy at work?
- Sandy, it's like chess,

01:23.692 --> 01:26.727
OK, but instead of using rooks
and pawns, they're strategically

01:26.795 --> 01:29.729
employing different combative
disciplines in order to win the match.

01:29.797 --> 01:31.998
- Hey, this nerd is with me.
- Yeah. Also, I have a thing

01:32.066 --> 01:34.000
for incredibly fit
half-naked men.

01:34.068 --> 01:36.402
- That's why she's with me.
- Hello!

01:36.470 --> 01:38.404
OK, seriously. Honestly,
all I see are brutes up there.

01:38.472 --> 01:40.640
OK, I will have you know
that that "brute",

01:40.708 --> 01:42.976
like Toby and I,
is a major advocate

01:43.044 --> 01:45.045
of the Sick Kids Hospital
Foundation.

01:45.112 --> 01:47.046
Yes, and volunteer
enough hours, they might even

01:47.113 --> 01:48.981
give you VIP tickets to your
favourite sporting event.

01:49.049 --> 01:50.549
I am in it for the children.

01:50.617 --> 01:53.786
- You are a saint.
- OK, do you wanna sit up there?

01:53.853 --> 01:55.955
There's plenty of seats
way in the back if you like.

01:56.022 --> 01:58.891
- Oh, you wanna sleep outside tonight? Yeah?
- So bad.

01:58.959 --> 02:02.160
Oh, check this out. Is that Simon
Kendall talking to Shane Dent?

02:02.228 --> 02:04.296
- Who's Simon Kendall?
- Simon Kendall. He runs

02:04.363 --> 02:07.765
the Global Fighting Network.
It's this new league. The GFN.

02:07.833 --> 02:09.576
Probably here to check out
the competition.

02:09.696 --> 02:10.414
Oh, yeah?

02:10.535 --> 02:13.171
Yeah, from what I hear,
Dent can't stand the guy.

02:13.239 --> 02:16.908
<i>And the fighters get their final
instructions from their corners.</i>

02:16.976 --> 02:19.876
Don't slug. Don't try
to finish. I want you there

02:19.944 --> 02:23.147
for the long haul. Take him down.
Ground and pound. You got this guy.

02:23.215 --> 02:27.318
<i>And they are on their feet, ready to do
battle in front of this capacity crowd.</i>

02:27.385 --> 02:28.919
Stick to the game plan.

02:28.987 --> 02:31.355
He's gonna do it. I know it.

02:31.423 --> 02:33.190
Big wave. ATF.

02:36.193 --> 02:40.530
<i> And there's the bell.
Baptiste and Furmanek connect.</i>

02:40.598 --> 02:42.632
<i>Furmanek with a right cross.</i>
<i>Baptiste counters.</i>

02:42.699 --> 02:45.668
- Shake it off, shake it off.
<i>- Furmanek looks shaken.</i>

02:45.736 --> 02:49.606
<i>Baptiste hooks to the body.</i>
<i>Another, and another.</i>

02:49.673 --> 02:51.507
<i>Furmanek creating some space,</i>
<i>but he looks shaky.</i>

02:51.574 --> 02:53.408
Oh, come on, Scotty,
get out of there.

02:53.476 --> 02:55.577
<i>And the hometown crowd</i>
<i>sounds none too happy about it.</i>

02:55.645 --> 02:57.946
<i>Both men throwing punches.</i>

03:00.049 --> 03:01.983
<i>Kick by Baptiste.</i>
<i>Stalking his opponent.</i>

03:02.051 --> 03:06.220
- Come on, come on, Scotty!
- Inside! Take him down!

03:06.288 --> 03:09.457
<i>- And Baptiste with the takedown!
- Von Flue, Scotty, Scotty!</i>

03:09.525 --> 03:12.114
- Hips out! Cycle!
- He's get Furmanek in a choke.

03:12.234 --> 03:13.328
Come on! Get him off!

03:13.448 --> 03:17.165
- What's going on? Is he OK?
- I don't know. I don't know.

03:17.232 --> 03:18.724
<i>What did you do me?</i>

03:18.844 --> 03:20.715
<i>Side control!
Turn and face him! Left leg over!</i>

03:20.835 --> 03:23.436
<i> Baptiste trying to
establishing the position</i>

03:23.504 --> 03:27.073
<i>right here. Trying to secure</i>
<i>the choke. Will he get it?</i>

03:27.141 --> 03:30.477
<i>- And Baptiste defeats Furmanek.</i>
<i>- That's it. It's over!</i>

03:30.545 --> 03:33.180
- That did not just happen.
- It's over!

03:33.247 --> 03:35.982
Scotty. Scotty!

03:36.050 --> 03:38.284
He's fine. He's fine.
He's just knocked out.

03:38.351 --> 03:40.085
He's not breathing!

03:40.153 --> 03:42.054
- Somebody get in there.
- He'll be fine. They're coming

03:42.121 --> 03:43.960
- to help him.
- Let's get the medic.

03:44.080 --> 03:45.405
Stay with me, buddy.

03:45.525 --> 03:47.307
Come on, Scotty.

03:47.427 --> 03:49.995
Scotty, wake up.

03:56.968 --> 03:59.003
Hey, Scotty,
get up, man!

03:59.071 --> 04:00.838
Oh, God. He's crashing.

I can assure you
that Scotty Furmanek

04:17.241 --> 04:19.909
- is gonna be OK.
- Come on, Scotty, come on.

04:19.976 --> 04:23.945
Oh, my baby, please, Scotty,
wake up. Please, OK?

04:24.013 --> 04:26.781
<i>Victory for Diego Baptiste!</i>

04:26.849 --> 04:29.851
Scotty. Scotty, baby, it's OK.
I'm right here, OK?

04:29.919 --> 04:32.521
Open your eyes. Wake up, baby.
Wake up.

04:32.589 --> 04:34.889
- Open your eyes, Scotty.
- He's gonna be fine.

04:34.957 --> 04:36.857
He's still got a chance.
He's in good hands.

04:36.925 --> 04:39.227
You know the signs as well
as I do, Oz. It's not good.

04:39.294 --> 04:41.195
Scotty Furmanek is unbreakable.

04:41.263 --> 04:44.098
It's more than that. I got
something before he went down.

04:44.166 --> 04:46.367
- I got...
- What did you get?

04:46.435 --> 04:48.536
Nothing. I just, you know,

04:48.604 --> 04:50.771
just had this feeling that
something wasn't right.

04:50.839 --> 04:52.672
- Did you get that feeling?
- You're damn right I got that feeling.

04:52.740 --> 04:54.608
This was Scotty's, man.
He had this fight in the bag.

04:54.675 --> 04:57.377
Let's just get out of here,
OK babe? Come on.

04:57.445 --> 05:00.913
- OK. We'll see you guys.
- All right.

05:00.981 --> 05:04.784
Yeah, one more, one more.
One more.

05:04.852 --> 05:06.319
Wanna go?

05:06.387 --> 05:08.421
Yeah. Let's go.

05:13.894 --> 05:16.562
I should get going. I'm at work.
Let's have beers later.

05:16.630 --> 05:18.264
All right, buddy. Bye.

05:18.331 --> 05:20.399
Still can't believe
he didn't make it, man.

05:20.467 --> 05:22.701
- He was 23 years old.
- Scotty was one of the greats.

05:22.769 --> 05:24.146
- Not you too.
- What?

05:24.266 --> 05:25.235
That's all anyone is
talking about.

05:25.355 --> 05:28.130
- Scotty the fighting fighter.
- The Fighting Furmanek,

05:28.250 --> 05:30.376
Michelle. It's a huge deal, OK?
This guy comes from like

05:30.443 --> 05:32.578
- a long line of fighting legends.
- Grandfather was an Olympic

05:32.645 --> 05:34.579
wrestler, his dad was
a Taekwondo god,

05:34.646 --> 05:36.547
and his younger brother, Ian,
well, he's young

05:36.615 --> 05:38.583
- but he's amazing.
- And his mom is the manager

05:38.650 --> 05:40.551
- of the whole dynasty.
- I just don't understand

05:40.619 --> 05:42.553
what it is about dudes
and beating the crap

05:42.621 --> 05:43.769
- out of each other.
- It's tradition.

05:43.889 --> 05:45.991
- Warrior versus warrior.
- Yeah. Gladiators.

05:46.058 --> 05:47.959
Sounds like you're all plugged
in to the Scotty Furmanek death.

05:48.027 --> 05:49.994
- I was there.
- Really?

05:50.061 --> 05:53.563
Good. You'll be an asset.
The Minister of Heritage has

05:53.683 --> 05:54.999
taken a special interest
in this incident.

05:55.066 --> 05:57.134
With all the
doping scandals lately,

05:57.202 --> 05:59.279
they're not taking
this accident lightly.

05:59.399 --> 06:00.790
Actually, I don't think
it was an accident.

06:00.910 --> 06:01.896
What do you mean?

06:02.016 --> 06:03.566
I read him before he went
down. He looked towards

06:03.686 --> 06:05.809
his corner and his family and
he thought, "What did you do?"

06:05.876 --> 06:09.012
- Who was in his corner?
- His mother, brother,

06:09.079 --> 06:13.016
trainer, even the league owner. He could
have been thinking about any one of them.

06:13.083 --> 06:14.984
According to the preliminary
tox screen, Scotty had

06:15.052 --> 06:17.153
some kind of steroid
in his system.

06:17.221 --> 06:19.255
It's hasn't been isolated yet.
And...

06:19.324 --> 06:21.590
GHB.

06:21.710 --> 06:22.914
GHB.

06:23.034 --> 06:25.321
Why would someone take
goop before a fight?

06:25.441 --> 06:28.157
- Goop?
- The formal name is

06:28.277 --> 06:31.994
Gamma-Hydroxybutyric Acid,
also known as goop or GHB.

06:32.114 --> 06:33.936
So why is it surprising
that he had it in his system?

06:34.003 --> 06:36.971
It would be insane for a fighter
to take GHB before a fight.

06:37.039 --> 06:40.475
- But what does it do exactly?
- It acts on the central nervous system

06:40.543 --> 06:43.445
as well as the brain affecting
several neurotransmitters.

06:43.512 --> 06:46.514
Yeah, it slows breathing, motor
skills, and blood circulation.

06:46.582 --> 06:49.417
It also leaves you sort of
off balance and tilted.

06:49.485 --> 06:52.186
Which is in line with how
he was acting when I read him.

06:52.254 --> 06:56.157
So maybe he upped his dosage,
OD'd? End of story.

06:56.225 --> 06:58.425
Or he was drugged.
It's not the end of the story.

06:58.493 --> 07:00.895
Well, Scotty Furmanek is
our assignment,

07:00.963 --> 07:03.530
and if doping killed him,
it's up to us to find out.

07:03.598 --> 07:05.099
And if your hunch is right,

07:05.167 --> 07:08.102
we might have a murder
on our hands. Keep me updated.

07:08.170 --> 07:11.238
- OK. So what else do we know?
- Well,

07:11.305 --> 07:13.840
the drug can be injected,
snorted, or ingested,

07:13.908 --> 07:16.176
and according to the reports,
it looks like

07:16.244 --> 07:18.644
Scotty had needle marks
on his right arm.

07:18.712 --> 07:22.419
We should visit Scotty's mother. She's
the gatekeeper of all things Furmanek.

07:22.539 --> 07:24.457
I think she might know about
his history with drugs.

07:24.577 --> 07:26.831
Alleged history.
We'll catch up?

07:26.951 --> 07:28.420
- Yep.
- Cool.

07:34.727 --> 07:37.629
I guess you can make a lot of money
in the mixed martial arts world.

07:37.697 --> 07:39.631
Scotty had
a lot of sponsorships.

07:39.699 --> 07:41.632
He was set to be a superstar
like his dad.

07:41.700 --> 07:43.634
I'm sure the mother took
a piece of the pie.

07:43.702 --> 07:45.703
How do you know so much
about this?

07:45.770 --> 07:48.038
- Oz. He's kind of a super-fan.
- Ah. But you're not?

07:48.106 --> 07:50.440
- No. I just keep my ears open.
- Mm-hmm.

07:50.509 --> 07:53.276
I'm a man, you know?

07:53.344 --> 07:56.647
I lost my husband
two years ago now.

07:56.715 --> 07:58.915
I don't know what my family's
done to deserve this.

07:58.983 --> 08:01.050
Well, nobody deserves this.

08:01.118 --> 08:03.419
I don't know why the ref
didn't stop Diego.

08:03.487 --> 08:06.455
Yeah. He grabbed Scotty's trachea
when he went for that guillotine.

08:06.524 --> 08:08.725
It was completely illegal.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.693
Maybe Scotty just didn't
see it coming.

08:10.761 --> 08:13.529
He trained for six hours a day
for three months.

08:13.596 --> 08:15.531
I refuse to believe
he wasn't ready.

08:15.598 --> 08:17.699
It was Diego. The guy's dirt.

08:17.767 --> 08:21.570
Were you aware that Scotty had
illegal drugs in his system?

08:21.638 --> 08:23.447
Scotty didn't use drugs.

08:23.567 --> 08:25.658
Where is this coming from?
Why is she asking this?

08:25.778 --> 08:29.011
Well, your son had, uh,
needle marks in his arms.

08:29.078 --> 08:31.012
Would you know anything
about that, Ian?

08:31.079 --> 08:33.014
I... I don't know.

08:36.484 --> 08:38.052
What about his trainer?

08:38.119 --> 08:41.087
Carter O'Brien? He's been with
the Furmanek Clan since forever.

08:41.155 --> 08:44.425
- He'd never do anything to hurt Scotty.
- You train with Carter too?

08:44.492 --> 08:46.492
What do you think about him?

08:46.561 --> 08:50.039
- Like my mom said, Carter's the best.
- Sorry, why are you asking

08:50.159 --> 08:51.080
these kind of questions?

08:51.200 --> 08:53.033
We're just trying to figure out
what happened in that ring.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.001
Octagon.

08:55.069 --> 08:57.370
Did Scotty and Diego have
a history

08:57.438 --> 08:59.505
- outside of the octagon?
- No.

08:59.574 --> 09:03.008
They're fighters. Shane made
sure they kept their distance.

09:03.076 --> 09:05.978
- Shane Dent?
- Mm-hmm.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.180
Was there any personal issues
in your son's life

09:08.247 --> 09:11.116
- that we should know about?
- No.

09:11.184 --> 09:12.818
He was good.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.153
Best shape of his career.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.690
After Diego, he was gonna
take the belt.

09:17.757 --> 09:21.093
And how was your relationship
with your son, Mrs. Furmanek?

09:21.160 --> 09:23.161
- But it's not your money.
- How do you think you got here?

09:23.229 --> 09:26.064
How do you think you got all this and
all this money? Because of your family.

09:26.132 --> 09:28.333
How dare you? How could you
say that to me? I'm your mother.

09:28.401 --> 09:31.736
I see what you're trying to do.
You don't understand me.

09:31.804 --> 09:34.671
You don't understand my family.

09:34.739 --> 09:36.840
There's no bad blood between us.

09:36.908 --> 09:38.542
I loved my son,

09:38.610 --> 09:41.378
and he loved me.

09:41.446 --> 09:43.780
If you think of anything else,
please give me a call.

09:43.848 --> 09:45.549
Scotty was a good boy!

09:45.617 --> 09:47.118
He's the victim here,

09:47.185 --> 09:48.752
and if you try to smear

09:48.820 --> 09:51.921
his reputation by saying he took
drugs, Sergeant, I will sue you.

09:51.989 --> 09:54.124
You, your department,

09:54.191 --> 09:55.925
the whole government.

09:55.993 --> 09:57.627
We'll be in touch,

09:57.694 --> 09:59.695
- Mrs. Furmanek.
- OK.

10:07.503 --> 10:09.403
I read Margo.
Scotty was upset with her.

10:09.471 --> 10:11.506
Something about spending money
that wasn't hers.

10:11.626 --> 10:12.554
What?
She was stealing money?

10:12.674 --> 10:14.342
Well, she could have been.
He was pretty mad.

10:14.409 --> 10:15.966
That is one
dysfunctional family.

10:16.086 --> 10:17.234
Have you heard
of a functional one?

10:17.354 --> 10:19.722
True. I'll have Dev go over
their financials.

10:19.842 --> 10:23.367
Also, Ian wasn't telling us everything.
He saw Carter inject Scotty.

10:23.487 --> 10:24.338
Why would he lie?

10:24.458 --> 10:26.571
His mother's got Scotty on a pedestal.
Maybe he was trying

10:26.638 --> 10:28.772
- to protect her from the truth.
- So Carter could be the one

10:28.840 --> 10:31.108
that Scotty meant when he said,
"What did you do?"

10:31.176 --> 10:33.566
Yeah. I guess we're gonna
pay him a visit, huh?

10:33.686 --> 10:34.568
He, what's up man?

10:34.688 --> 10:37.781
<i>Hey. Toby.
Listen, I'm sorry to bother you at work</i>

10:37.849 --> 10:40.217
but you mentioned there might be
more to Scotty's death.

10:40.284 --> 10:42.619
Look, you know I can't talk
about an investigation, Oz.

10:42.687 --> 10:45.955
<i>I know you can't. And I'm sure you guys
are all over this, but just in case,</i>

10:46.023 --> 10:48.791
you should know that Diego Baptiste
has a reputation as a dirty fighter.

10:48.859 --> 10:51.361
- Oh, yeah? Like how?
- <i>Just all kinds of borderline</i>

10:51.429 --> 10:53.597
<i>illegal stuff. Fish hooking,</i>

10:53.664 --> 10:56.337
working the small joints, eye gouging.
The man's an animal.

10:56.457 --> 10:58.777
lan said he saw Diego
grab Scotty's trachea.

10:58.897 --> 11:01.803
<i>Well, actually, there was a rumor in a
fight in Brazil in 2010 that he put</i>

11:01.871 --> 11:04.267
ether on his wristbands.
Knocked the other fighter out cold.

11:04.387 --> 11:05.322
<i>That's good to know.</i>

11:05.442 --> 11:07.543
<i>Hey, anything else I can do,
you let me know, OK?</i>

11:07.611 --> 11:09.378
Thanks, Oz.

11:11.780 --> 11:14.449
He was the best
pound-for-pound fighter we had.

11:14.516 --> 11:16.117
He was gonna go all the way.

11:16.184 --> 11:18.219
Yeah, he will be missed.

11:18.287 --> 11:20.555
By me, by his family,

11:20.623 --> 11:22.557
his fans, and the sport.

11:22.625 --> 11:24.425
He was one of the great ones.

11:24.493 --> 11:26.160
Thank you, Mr. O'Brien.

11:26.228 --> 11:28.128
- We'll let you get back to work.
- Carter O'Brien?

11:28.195 --> 11:30.731
- That's me.
- IIB. Do you have a minute?

11:30.798 --> 11:32.932
Yeah. How can I help you?

11:33.000 --> 11:35.034
Is this where you train
all of your fighters?

11:35.102 --> 11:37.504
Yeah. It's the best gym
in the country.

11:37.572 --> 11:39.973
Well, how long had you been
training Scotty?

11:40.040 --> 11:43.309
Well, me and his old man, Joe,
we came up together as fighters.

11:43.377 --> 11:45.711
I had a little accident,
didn't see a kick,

11:45.779 --> 11:47.713
ruptured my ear drum.

11:47.781 --> 11:50.983
Balance was never the same
since. That was...

11:51.050 --> 11:53.952
about 10 years ago, so I guess it's
eight years I've been trainin' Scotty.

11:54.020 --> 11:56.322
Well, in those eight years,
did you ever witness Scotty

11:56.390 --> 11:59.056
- taking any kind of illegal drug?
- No way.

11:59.124 --> 12:01.526
No. Scotty was as clean
as they come. Good kid.

12:01.594 --> 12:03.662
- Real good kid.
- You see, we've got witnesses

12:03.729 --> 12:07.399
who said they saw you
injecting Scotty with drugs.

12:09.402 --> 12:12.837
I don't know what it is
that you are drivin' at,

12:12.905 --> 12:15.861
but I've never given Scotty or any
of my fighters illegal drugs.

12:15.981 --> 12:18.042
Well, you injected him
with something.

12:18.110 --> 12:21.112
Yeah, sure. I gave him cortisone shots.
That's standard stuff.

12:21.179 --> 12:22.946
We're gonna need to take

12:23.015 --> 12:24.815
your ringside equipment, OK?

12:24.883 --> 12:28.085
Any syringes, towels,
water bottles. Everything.

12:28.153 --> 12:31.087
Look, I own this gym.
I have a reputation to uphold.

12:31.155 --> 12:33.830
Now, a tragedy occurred
yesterday, but I swear to you

12:33.950 --> 12:35.049
I had nothin' to do with it.

12:35.169 --> 12:37.490
That's good to know, but we're still gonna
need to take everything into evidence.

12:37.610 --> 12:38.509
You wanna take it, take it.

12:38.629 --> 12:39.497
You ain't gonna find nothin'.

12:39.617 --> 12:41.731
Could Diego have had access
to Scotty's locker room

12:41.798 --> 12:45.568
- or his kit before the fight?
- No. Diego would not be allowed in here.

12:48.071 --> 12:50.739
- You sure about that?
- I swear. Look,

12:50.806 --> 12:52.541
I don't know what it is
you guys are trying to do

12:52.608 --> 12:55.644
to the Furmanek name, to that
legacy, but it ain't right.

12:55.711 --> 12:57.712
- Are we done here?
- Yeah, for now.

12:57.780 --> 12:59.515
Good.

12:59.582 --> 13:01.750
Diego is definitely involved.

13:01.817 --> 13:04.085
I saw him handing Carter
a bunch of money.

13:04.153 --> 13:05.753
So Diego bribes Carter

13:05.820 --> 13:09.857
to tamper with the cortisone
shots and ensures a win.

13:09.925 --> 13:12.726
Dev. I need an address
for Diego Baptiste.

13:17.666 --> 13:19.132
Diego.

13:19.200 --> 13:21.101
IIB. We'd like to ask you
a few questions

13:21.169 --> 13:23.203
about Scotty Furmanek. Hey.

13:23.323 --> 13:24.440
Like what?

13:24.560 --> 13:26.639
Hey, hey, hey.
What the hell's going on here?

13:26.707 --> 13:28.575
- Officer, please...
- Sergeant.

13:28.642 --> 13:31.545
Look, I'm just trying to help my client
make his flight to Montreal, OK?

13:31.612 --> 13:33.646
Your client is coming with us.
If you want to help him,

13:33.714 --> 13:36.215
you can get him a lawyer.
Diego, get out of the car.

13:43.690 --> 13:46.158
Look, I don't know what kind

13:46.226 --> 13:48.160
of octagon or playpen
you think this is,

13:48.228 --> 13:50.261
but if you think trying
to intimidate me is a good idea,

13:50.329 --> 13:52.797
you are very, very wrong.

13:52.864 --> 13:56.834
Diego, chill. Look, I'll call our lawyers.
Make this thing go away, all right?

13:59.105 --> 14:02.540
- So I guess I'm missing my flight, hmm?
- Yeah.

14:04.000 --> 14:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:11.121 --> 14:13.088
I've had thousands of guys
in those choke holds

14:13.156 --> 14:15.557
for way longer than I did
Scotty Furmanek.

14:15.625 --> 14:18.346
- So then what happened?
- Just wasn't his day is all.

14:18.466 --> 14:20.681
- But it was your day?
- I won, didn't I?

14:20.801 --> 14:23.064
We understand you're not
the kind of guy who likes to lose.

14:23.184 --> 14:24.340
You know someone who does?

14:24.460 --> 14:26.567
How far are you willing to go
to make sure you win?

14:26.635 --> 14:29.737
- Don't answer that.
- No, I'll answer. I'd do anything.

14:32.308 --> 14:35.443
So, what are his weak spots?

14:35.510 --> 14:38.379
Would you bribe Carter O'Brien
for inside information?

14:38.447 --> 14:40.781
- Don't answer that.
- What about drugs?

14:40.849 --> 14:43.150
- Do you take anything?
- Sure. Lots.

14:43.218 --> 14:46.253
- Tylenol. Advil. Aspirin.
- Did you ever give Scotty

14:46.321 --> 14:48.255
anything to ensure
that you would win?

14:48.323 --> 14:51.258
- All right, that's enough.
- Did you drug Scotty Furmanek?

14:51.326 --> 14:53.226
I think that we're done here.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.995
<i>The guy got</i>
<i>what he deserved.</i>

14:56.063 --> 14:58.931
Well, thank you for your
cooperation, Mr. Baptiste.

14:58.999 --> 15:01.835
I'm glad I could help.

15:01.902 --> 15:05.304
Diego certainly fits
the profile.

15:05.373 --> 15:07.906
Yeah, I think the money that
Diego gave Carter was for intel

15:07.974 --> 15:10.476
- on Scotty's fight strategy.
- Where does that leave Carter?

15:10.543 --> 15:13.078
Carter was not as loyal
as the Furmanek family thinks.

15:13.145 --> 15:15.146
It makes you wonder what else
he'd do for the right price.

15:15.214 --> 15:18.884
Hey. Carter and Scotty's
equipment got back from the lab.

15:18.951 --> 15:22.087
Now, there were traces

15:22.154 --> 15:24.627
of cortisone
in one of the syringes,

15:24.747 --> 15:26.231
but no GHB on anything.

15:26.351 --> 15:28.793
So we still don't know how
the drugs got into his system.

15:28.861 --> 15:32.630
- Where are we on Mom the manager?
- Her financials are a mess.

15:32.750 --> 15:33.758
She's broke?

15:33.878 --> 15:36.501
Worse. She's in the red.
She's got two mortgages, and her

15:36.568 --> 15:39.470
- credit's completely maxed out.
- Was she stealing money from Scotty?

15:39.538 --> 15:42.506
- Well, it's hard to say.
- So maybe Scotty got sick of her spending,

15:42.573 --> 15:44.775
- decided to cut her off?
- So she killed him?

15:44.842 --> 15:47.411
Scotty's her main source
of income. Not a smart move

15:47.478 --> 15:49.236
to kill the goose
that laid the golden egg.

15:49.356 --> 15:53.250
Actually, it might be. I was
looking into insurance claims,

15:53.318 --> 15:55.984
and it seems that a couple
of people are looking to make

15:56.104 --> 15:57.586
- money off Scotty's death.
- Who?

15:57.654 --> 15:59.923
Well, for one,
our league owner, Shane Dent.

15:59.990 --> 16:02.658
He had an insurance policy
on the specific fight itself,

16:02.726 --> 16:05.328
protecting himself against
lawsuits in case of deaths.

16:05.396 --> 16:07.830
Nothing unusual there.
He's a businessman.

16:07.898 --> 16:11.367
- He'd be an idiot not to have a policy.
- Who else?

16:11.435 --> 16:13.768
Scott himself.
He had his own policy,

16:13.836 --> 16:15.770
but a fighter's body is
everything to them.

16:15.838 --> 16:17.772
Safe to assume he didn't
kill himself for the money.

16:17.840 --> 16:20.542
But who was listed as the
beneficiary in case of death?

16:20.609 --> 16:23.745
I'm getting there. I'm just trying
to build up some anticipation.

16:23.813 --> 16:27.249
Not only did Margo have her own
policy on Scotty,

16:27.317 --> 16:29.651
but she was also in line
to make the purse off the fight,

16:29.718 --> 16:31.853
and all of his money
from his own policy.

16:31.921 --> 16:34.889
Now, here's where it gets interesting.
Dent was named the beneficiary

16:34.957 --> 16:37.158
- on all of her insurance claims.
- Why?

16:37.225 --> 16:39.126
I don't know.
I'm still looking into it,

16:39.194 --> 16:41.429
but he's looking to make a nice
little bonus because of it.

16:41.497 --> 16:43.531
Think Margo and Dent had
something going on?

16:43.599 --> 16:46.467
- Could be.
- We should talk to Dent.

16:46.534 --> 16:49.570
Well, Scotty's funeral's tomorrow. I'm
sure he'll be there to pay his respects.

16:49.637 --> 16:51.304
See you there.

16:55.343 --> 16:57.277
If Margo is sleeping
with Dent, I mean,

16:57.345 --> 16:59.279
that definitely splits
her allegiances.

16:59.347 --> 17:01.614
All right, we do not know
for sure that they are involved.

17:01.682 --> 17:04.349
Why else would she name him
the beneficiary

17:04.416 --> 17:06.986
- for the insurance claims?
- Dent didn't become who he is

17:07.053 --> 17:10.155
without knowing how to manipulate people.
He was a friend of her husband's.

17:10.223 --> 17:13.258
Maybe he pulled the loyalty card
and he somehow got

17:13.326 --> 17:15.795
his name
on the insurance papers.

17:15.863 --> 17:18.195
So, you're saying that Margo
is the victim in all of this?

17:18.262 --> 17:20.832
I'm saying I don't know,
but you seem

17:20.900 --> 17:22.800
- to have made up your mind.
- Yeah, I mean,

17:22.868 --> 17:25.537
she mismanages Scotty's money,
she gives the man

17:25.605 --> 17:28.640
who's in control of his safety
financial motivation to kill him,

17:28.708 --> 17:30.876
and she's probably
having an affair with the guy.

17:30.943 --> 17:32.477
If that is all true,

17:32.544 --> 17:35.813
then yes, she did not do right
by Scotty as his manager.

17:35.881 --> 17:38.849
But I do think as a mother you're
responsible for your children's safety.

17:38.917 --> 17:40.951
I just don't think
that Margo chose

17:41.019 --> 17:43.754
to have an affair with the man
that killed her son.

17:43.822 --> 17:47.190
Well, hopefully we'll find out
at the funeral.

17:52.045 --> 17:53.879
Yo.

17:53.947 --> 17:55.847
- Hey, you better make it two.
- Oh, yeah?

17:55.915 --> 17:57.484
I could totally
go for a beer right now.

17:57.604 --> 18:00.169
- Here, have this.
- Thank you.

18:00.237 --> 18:01.704
How you feeling?

18:01.772 --> 18:03.706
You know, I'm still bothered

18:03.774 --> 18:05.841
by this whole
Scott Furmanek thing.

18:05.909 --> 18:08.348
- I can't believe he's gone.
- He was a great athlete.

18:08.468 --> 18:10.654
He was more than just a fighter, though.
A lot of people really looked up

18:10.774 --> 18:13.549
to him, you know? You guys
got any leads yet, or...?

18:13.616 --> 18:15.662
We're getting there.
We're gonna get to the bottom of it.

18:15.782 --> 18:16.666
Well, I hope you do it soon.

18:16.786 --> 18:18.687
I mean for your sake too.
The internet's just crawling

18:18.755 --> 18:20.988
with all these Twitter
conspiracies, people saying

18:21.056 --> 18:22.990
Scotty was doping. I don't
believe it for a second.

18:23.058 --> 18:25.526
- You're preaching to the choir.
- You know he was supposed to go

18:25.594 --> 18:28.382
to Sick Kids tomorrow? Those
kids are gonna be devastated.

18:28.502 --> 18:30.802
Someone's gotta tell them. Apparently
his brother's going in his place.

18:30.922 --> 18:36.070
They say Ian's going to be a great fighter
one day, just like Scotty. He's a good kid.

18:36.137 --> 18:38.104
You know, I've been
volunteering at that foundation

18:38.172 --> 18:40.874
for three years. I should go
down there tomorrow. You know,

18:40.942 --> 18:44.010
maybe help Ian out, see how these kids
are doing, help explain all this stuff.

18:44.078 --> 18:46.179
Yes. That is a great idea.

18:46.246 --> 18:48.181
- I could do that.
- Make 'em laugh.

18:48.248 --> 18:50.349
Cheer 'em up, sure. See?
This is why I keep

18:50.417 --> 18:54.519
coming in here. Good advice.
You're a good listener.

18:54.588 --> 18:56.722
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

18:56.790 --> 18:59.257
- Where's your beer.
- That's my last beer.

18:59.325 --> 19:02.728
- You keep it.  Yeah.
- You sure.

19:02.796 --> 19:06.031
II,
by Beethoven playing quietly)

19:06.099 --> 19:08.700
It's gonna be OK.

19:15.874 --> 19:18.309
- That's Simon Kendall right?
- Mm-hmm.

19:18.376 --> 19:21.412
He's the owner of GFN.
That's Dent's competition.

19:21.480 --> 19:23.681
Dent doesn't seem
very happy to see him.

19:23.749 --> 19:26.249
No, he doesn't,
does he? I guess he's just here

19:26.317 --> 19:28.251
- to pay his respects.
- Yeah.

19:28.319 --> 19:30.220
- Sorry for your loss.
- Thank you for coming.

19:30.287 --> 19:32.388
Really sorry.

19:37.028 --> 19:40.850
<i>If Dent couldn't have you,</i>
<i>I guess nobody else could.</i>

19:46.036 --> 19:47.870
I just got a read off Kendall.

19:47.938 --> 19:49.571
Hey.

19:52.943 --> 19:55.244
- Oh, my god.
- What the hell is he

19:55.311 --> 19:58.880
doing here? How dare you show
your face at this funeral!

20:01.884 --> 20:04.786
- I was invited.
- Yeah, well not by me you weren't!

20:04.854 --> 20:08.322
- OK, OK. Not now. Not here.
- Get him out of here.

20:10.325 --> 20:13.093
- Peace.
- Get him out of here.

20:15.530 --> 20:18.632
He's not worth it, Ian, OK?
This is not the place.

20:18.700 --> 20:20.600
You've got some balls
coming here.

20:20.669 --> 20:23.704
Yeah, well, I wouldn't want
to miss the show.

20:32.813 --> 20:35.848
- I will not let you do this.
- Taking Kendall's offer.

20:37.951 --> 20:40.787
I think Scotty was going
to leave Dent's league.

20:40.854 --> 20:42.068
And Dent knew?

20:42.188 --> 20:44.723
Yeah. And with the biggest
star in MMA jumping ship,

20:44.791 --> 20:47.993
- that would leave Dent high and dry.
- Well, that would certainly be

20:48.061 --> 20:50.128
motive, but what about
your read?

20:50.196 --> 20:52.998
Kendall thought that if Dent
couldn't have Scotty, nobody would.

20:53.066 --> 20:55.901
So maybe we just found
our killer.

21:02.751 --> 21:06.687
So, we think Scotty was leaving
Dent to join Kendall's new GFN.

21:06.755 --> 21:10.223
And when Scotty's fans followed, it would
cause a major shift in the power struggle.

21:10.291 --> 21:13.259
- It would have made Dent furious.
- Furious enough to kill Scotty?

21:13.326 --> 21:16.195
You lose the biggest star in MMA,
that could be the end of your league.

21:16.263 --> 21:18.431
I want to talk to Kendall
before we bring Dent in, OK?

21:18.499 --> 21:20.867
Find out what exactly was
negotiated, who knew what,

21:20.934 --> 21:22.869
- every little detail.
- I'll text you his address.

21:22.936 --> 21:25.137
OK. And Margo, she's
definitely still a suspect.

21:25.205 --> 21:27.672
I want to know why Dent was
listed as her beneficiary.

21:27.740 --> 21:29.608
Working on it.

21:32.344 --> 21:35.280
I didn't think Scotty told
anyone about our arrangement.

21:35.347 --> 21:37.582
So then it's true Scotty was
leaving to join your league?

21:37.650 --> 21:40.218
His contract with Dent was
up for renegotiation.

21:40.286 --> 21:42.387
If he won the fight against
Diego, he was coming over to me.

21:42.454 --> 21:45.055
- And if he didn't win?
- Look, the deal was

21:45.123 --> 21:47.525
that the undefeated Scotty
Furmanek was joining my league.

21:47.592 --> 21:49.460
- That's a lot of pressure.
- This business is

21:49.528 --> 21:52.229
all about pressure.
Stakes. Drama. The story.

21:52.297 --> 21:53.931
The story I wanted was that

21:53.998 --> 21:56.834
Scotty the Fighting Furmanek was
joining Kendall's GFN.

21:56.902 --> 22:00.369
He was gonna be my big fish. Yeah, you get
the big fish, the little fish follow.

22:00.438 --> 22:03.640
- That was the plan.
- So Dent had a lot to lose.

22:03.707 --> 22:06.543
He was gonna lose everything. And
losing the fighter of tomorrow,

22:06.610 --> 22:09.345
well, no one wants to be part
of that headline.

22:09.413 --> 22:11.013
Did Dent know about the deal?

22:11.081 --> 22:13.249
It was supposed to be
a closely guarded secret,

22:13.317 --> 22:17.519
but MMA, they, um... they have
a lot of secrets.

22:17.587 --> 22:20.823
So, who was it that went over the details
of the contract? Was that you and Margo?

22:20.890 --> 22:24.793
Scotty's mom? No. Scotty and I, we
worked out the particulars on our own.

22:24.861 --> 22:28.364
- Was Margo upset about that?
- Again, I don't think she knew.

22:28.432 --> 22:31.166
She's holding you back.
You know it.

22:31.233 --> 22:33.013
Did you pressure Scotty
to leave his mother?

22:33.133 --> 22:34.215
No. Not at all.

22:34.335 --> 22:35.915
So then why did you leave
her out of it?

22:36.035 --> 22:37.386
Dent has her under his spell.

22:37.506 --> 22:40.708
I promise you, he doesn't care
about Scotty or the mom.

22:40.776 --> 22:43.211
- It's all about Dent.
- And you're noting like that?

22:43.279 --> 22:46.314
No. I'm trying to build
a relationship with my fighters.

22:46.382 --> 22:48.949
Dent doesn't roll like that.

22:49.017 --> 22:50.784
Never has, never will.

22:50.852 --> 22:54.554
Thank you for your time. Dev.

22:54.622 --> 22:57.691
Hey. I found out why Dent is Margo's
beneficiary on all the insurance policies.

22:57.758 --> 22:59.826
The guy's basically been
like a loan shark to her.

22:59.894 --> 23:02.729
He's been lending her money for
years with an insane interest rate.

23:04.764 --> 23:06.732
That's why she's so loyal
to him.

23:06.800 --> 23:09.835
Kendall just confirmed that Scotty
was moving over to his league.

23:09.903 --> 23:12.005
If Scotty left his mom
in the dust, she'd have no way

23:12.072 --> 23:13.873
of paying Dent back.

23:13.940 --> 23:16.542
So he kills him, Kendall's
league is no longer a threat.

23:16.610 --> 23:19.177
And the insurance money is
just the cherry on top.

23:19.245 --> 23:22.147
- Sure sounds like motive to me.
<i>- Yeah, bring him in.</i>

23:25.784 --> 23:27.486
What kind of mother

23:27.553 --> 23:29.488
puts her debts
before her children?

23:29.555 --> 23:32.557
The kind of mother
who's in over her head,

23:32.625 --> 23:34.493
and being exploited
by someone with power.

23:34.560 --> 23:37.594
I don't get how you can
defend her choices.

23:37.662 --> 23:39.897
OK, I grew up in foster homes.
I know that parents can make

23:39.964 --> 23:42.266
worse mistakes than trusting
someone they shouldn't.

23:42.334 --> 23:45.369
Well, you know, Margo talks
about family and loyalty

23:45.437 --> 23:48.739
and protecting the family name.
It's just all so duplicitous.

23:48.806 --> 23:50.674
You're being a bit harsh,
don't you think?

23:50.742 --> 23:53.009
I don't understand how
as a mother you can encourage

23:53.077 --> 23:55.178
your child to participate
in a sport

23:55.246 --> 23:57.414
that already put one in them
in a grave.

23:57.481 --> 23:59.782
People have their reasons,
whatever they are.

23:59.850 --> 24:01.884
How could a mother do that?

24:01.952 --> 24:05.455
Kinda makes you think twice about
starting a family, doesn't it?

24:05.523 --> 24:08.023
- Seriously?
- I mean, you and Adam,

24:08.091 --> 24:11.326
you guys, you want to have kids, right?
Isn't that what you're doing?

24:11.394 --> 24:13.495
I don't... I don't know.

24:13.563 --> 24:15.531
It's good to know
that you're decisive.

24:15.598 --> 24:18.534
You want decisive, I will give
you decisive. I can tell you

24:18.601 --> 24:21.703
if we do have children, I would
never put them in the ring.

24:21.771 --> 24:25.073
- Octagon.
- You know it's a very long walk

24:25.140 --> 24:27.341
- back to the IIB, right?
- All right, all right.

24:32.881 --> 24:35.183
- No lawyer?
- Uh, no, I have

24:35.250 --> 24:37.351
- nothing to hide, Sergeant.
- Are you aware

24:37.419 --> 24:40.720
that Scotty was leaving you
to join Kendall's league?

24:40.788 --> 24:43.590
- No. Never heard that one.
- You sure?

24:43.657 --> 24:45.959
'Cause we know he told you
before the fight.

24:46.026 --> 24:48.962
Oh, yeah? Wow.
After all I did for him, huh?

24:49.029 --> 24:51.498
What, taking advantage
of him financially?

24:51.566 --> 24:53.933
- I paid him fine.
- That's not what we hear.

24:54.001 --> 24:56.902
Hey, my business agreements are
all above board. All of them.

24:56.970 --> 24:58.870
If you think
loan-sharking is legal.

24:58.938 --> 25:01.207
Look, if you're referring
to the money I lent Margo,

25:01.274 --> 25:04.009
she, uh, she knew
the conditions.

25:04.077 --> 25:06.044
Look at that, Michelle,
we have another saint.

25:06.113 --> 25:08.447
Yeah, losing Scotty would have
been a huge loss for you.

25:08.515 --> 25:10.133
I guess we'll never know,
right?

25:10.253 --> 25:12.081
It's a done deal

25:12.201 --> 25:14.744
No. No, no, no.
Not if I have anything to do with it.

25:15.488 --> 25:18.689
You were afraid if Scotty left, the
rest of your fighters would follow.

25:18.757 --> 25:21.159
So you drugged him and
you sent him in there to lose.

25:21.227 --> 25:23.060
No.

25:23.129 --> 25:24.762
But the dosage was too high.

25:27.399 --> 25:30.868
Look, you think
I killed my own fighter, huh?

25:30.936 --> 25:33.671
- Lady, you are way off.
- Hey, Sergeant to you.

25:33.739 --> 25:35.339
Did you forget again?

25:37.308 --> 25:39.243
I, uh...

25:39.310 --> 25:41.045
I want my lawyer now.

25:41.113 --> 25:44.580
Something to hide,
Mr. Dent?

25:47.051 --> 25:48.952
There's no question
he has motive,

25:49.020 --> 25:51.621
but I didn't see anything that
would suggest he drugged Scotty.

25:51.689 --> 25:55.058
Hey. The ME came in,
and the GHB

25:55.126 --> 25:58.261
that led to Scotty's death was
ingested, not injected.

25:58.328 --> 26:00.929
Right, but everything
in Carter's kit was clean.

26:00.997 --> 26:03.899
It says here that he had such a significant
amount of GHB in his system that there's

26:03.967 --> 26:05.887
no way he would have made it
through the first round.

26:06.007 --> 26:07.851
OK, so he ingested it

26:07.971 --> 26:10.172
in between rounds.
The drugs start kicking in,

26:10.239 --> 26:12.741
he looks into the corner
and thinks, "What did you do?"

26:12.809 --> 26:16.310
So, which one of our suspects
is connected to the drug?

26:16.378 --> 26:18.646
Dev, can you check out Dent
and Margo's phone records?

26:18.714 --> 26:20.682
See if there's any suspicious
calls or text message.

26:20.749 --> 26:22.750
Yeah, I went through
all that stuff already.

26:22.818 --> 26:24.709
I didn't find anything,
but I can keep digging.

26:24.829 --> 26:25.440
OK.

26:33.027 --> 26:34.928
- Yes!
- Again?

26:34.996 --> 26:36.930
Thanks for letting me visit,
guys.

26:36.998 --> 26:39.265
I know Scotty would've wanted
to be here.

26:39.333 --> 26:41.621
He wouldn't have missed this
for the world.

26:41.741 --> 26:42.953
Can you sign this for me?

26:43.073 --> 26:46.015
Yeah, man, of course.
Cool. You gotta sign one

26:46.135 --> 26:47.412
- for me, though. Is that a deal?
- Okay.

26:47.532 --> 26:49.556
- OK, deal.
- Thanks. All right. Can you sign

26:49.676 --> 26:51.677
- this one?
- OK.

26:51.745 --> 26:53.979
- Hey, how's it going?
- That one's special.

26:54.047 --> 26:55.981
Hey.

26:56.049 --> 26:58.150
- Hey.
- I just wanted to say thanks

26:58.218 --> 27:01.587
for coming out and being here for the kids.
I mean, it clearly means a lot to them.

27:01.654 --> 27:03.770
They're probably disappointed
that it's me and not my brother.

27:03.890 --> 27:05.304
No, I wouldn't say that.

27:05.424 --> 27:08.559
- Ian.
- I know who you are. I'm Oz.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.763
I've actually been volunteering
here for a few years...

27:11.831 --> 27:14.532
almost as long as I've been
a fan of the Fighting Furmaneks.

27:14.600 --> 27:17.102
Yeah, my dad and Scotty were
two of the greats.

27:17.169 --> 27:19.003
Hey, don't sell yourself short, OK?
You haven't won the championship yet,

27:19.071 --> 27:21.805
but I think you've got a bright
future ahead of you, sir.

27:21.873 --> 27:24.141
- Can I sign you as my PR agent?
- Absolutely.

27:24.209 --> 27:27.743
I mean, your dad didn't start winning
championships until he was in his 30s, right?

27:28.019 --> 27:29.720
I mean, look how much
he achieved in his career.

27:29.840 --> 27:31.594
I don't think I have
what he had.

27:31.714 --> 27:34.031
Actually, your fighting style
reminds me a lot of him.

27:34.151 --> 27:35.866
Your roundhouse kick,
how you do...

27:35.986 --> 27:39.789
I can't really do it 'cause I've got a hip
thing. Where you go downwards on the kick?

27:39.857 --> 27:43.126
I know what you're talking about, man. Yeah,
he taught me, higher risk, higher reward.

27:43.193 --> 27:46.629
Exactly. Well, he'd be proud of you.

27:46.696 --> 27:49.298
Well, that's why I gotta
take Diego down.

27:49.366 --> 27:52.467
Diego? What, are you gonna
have him taken care of?

27:52.534 --> 27:54.469
You bet I am. You know,

27:54.536 --> 27:56.738
Dent's about to announce
the fight, so...

27:56.806 --> 27:59.737
- Don't tweet that.
Hold on. Are you seriously talking

27:59.857 --> 28:02.157
- about fighting Diego Baptiste?
- Yeah.

28:02.277 --> 28:05.047
The guy is a maniac. And he's like
two weight classes above you.

28:05.167 --> 28:07.304
I'll gain 20 pounds.
I got two months.

28:07.424 --> 28:11.585
Ian, I mean, no disrespect,
OK, you're a great fighter,

28:11.652 --> 28:13.554
but are you sure
you're ready for that?

28:13.621 --> 28:16.022
I have to take him down
for my mom, my dad,

28:16.091 --> 28:17.624
and for Scotty.

28:18.760 --> 28:21.188
You know, it was nice to meet you,
though, man.

28:21.308 --> 28:22.691
Yeah. Yeah, you too.

28:22.811 --> 28:25.165
- You coming? Let's do another game.
- Yeah, man. Let's go.

28:25.233 --> 28:28.315
Let's do this. Let's do this,
guys. Let's go, let's go.

28:28.435 --> 28:29.502
Hey, good luck.

28:29.570 --> 28:32.437
Thanks.

28:32.505 --> 28:35.507
Dropped it here.
OK, now we can go.

28:35.575 --> 28:37.442
All right.

28:37.510 --> 28:39.678
I mean, he can't do it.
Like, seriously.

28:39.746 --> 28:41.313
How can Ian Furmanek think

28:41.380 --> 28:43.381
he can defeat Diego Baptiste
in a fight?

28:43.449 --> 28:46.318
They're trying to capitalize on
what happened, make more money.

28:46.385 --> 28:48.385
No, Ian would not do that, OK?
I met the man.

28:48.453 --> 28:51.288
OK, did you really think that these
guys fought for the love of the game?

28:51.356 --> 28:53.290
You know what, call me naive,
but yes, I did.

28:53.358 --> 28:55.392
- Naive.
- That's cute. Eat your noodles.

28:55.460 --> 28:58.429
- What are you watching?
- I'm just watching the end of the fight again.

28:58.496 --> 29:03.066
I don't know the sport the way you guys
do, but it all just felt kinda wrong.

29:03.134 --> 29:05.602
Yeah, tell me about it.
Can I see this for a sec?

29:05.669 --> 29:09.039
Let me see this.

29:09.107 --> 29:11.208
What was that?
What?

29:11.275 --> 29:14.820
Look at the mouthguard.
Oz, can you email this to me?

29:14.940 --> 29:15.723
Yeah, sure.

29:15.843 --> 29:18.148
I gotta go. Make sure you turn
off the stove. That's on you.

29:18.216 --> 29:20.449
You're right there. You're
standing right by the stove.

29:20.516 --> 29:22.885
Where are you going?

29:22.953 --> 29:26.155
- Thank you for, you know...
- Thank you for lunch.

29:26.223 --> 29:28.257
So, I've stitched
all the footage I can find

29:28.324 --> 29:31.693
from YouTube, the arena surveillance
cameras, and some TSN footage,

29:31.762 --> 29:35.296
and now I just have to put
Oz's footage into the mix and...

29:35.364 --> 29:37.732
Voila.

29:37.800 --> 29:39.934
Here we go.

29:40.002 --> 29:43.471
All right.
Slow down here.

29:43.538 --> 29:45.506
Pause, press pause.

29:45.574 --> 29:48.509
- You see that?
- Um...

29:48.577 --> 29:51.044
- You notice anything?
- Out of the ordinary?

29:51.112 --> 29:52.980
What's the colour
of Scott's mouthguard?

29:53.047 --> 29:54.514
Uh, white?

29:54.582 --> 29:58.018
This is the only one
Carter gave us. Black.

29:58.086 --> 29:59.953
There's two mouthguards.

30:00.021 --> 30:01.955
So Carter didn't give us
all of Scotty's equipment.

30:02.023 --> 30:05.025
- The drugs were in the white one.
- He lied to us?

30:05.093 --> 30:06.559
Now we know the murder weapon.

30:09.834 --> 30:12.632
That's it. Hands up,
hand's up. Come on, strong.

30:12.699 --> 30:15.468
Search every locker, every gym
bag, I want this place stripped.

30:15.535 --> 30:17.503
Hey, what the hell's
going on here?

30:17.571 --> 30:19.816
- We have a search warrant.
- For what? I gave you

30:19.936 --> 30:21.878
- everything you asked me for.
- Scotty used two mouthguards

30:21.998 --> 30:23.575
during the fight.
You gave us one.

30:23.643 --> 30:26.278
- You still think I'd hurt him?
- We believe the missing

30:26.345 --> 30:29.213
mouthguard carried GHB. You're the one
who gave it to him between rounds.

30:29.282 --> 30:32.183
OK, whoa, whoa, whoa. I just
grabbed what was in the kit.

30:32.303 --> 30:33.371
Who else had access to it?

30:33.491 --> 30:35.119
I don't know. People were
comin' and goin' all night.

30:35.187 --> 30:37.120
I want to see the lockers.

30:37.188 --> 30:38.955
This way.

30:39.023 --> 30:41.992
Hey, Ian. Didn't expect
to see you here.

30:42.059 --> 30:44.762
Yeah, I'm training.

30:44.829 --> 30:46.409
Trying to keep my mind occupied.

30:46.529 --> 30:48.280
I heard about this fight
between you and Diego.

30:48.400 --> 30:50.696
Yeah. It's just something
that I gotta do, you know?

30:50.816 --> 30:52.434
You sure you want to do this?

30:53.337 --> 30:58.074
You will, for your brother.
For this family.

30:58.142 --> 31:01.577
Your mother seems pretty focused.
Is she the one making you fight?

31:01.645 --> 31:05.215
Not at all. Like I said,
just something I gotta do.

31:05.283 --> 31:09.051
Someone's definitely
selling drugs here.

31:09.119 --> 31:11.086
I got strict rules
against this kind of thing.

31:11.154 --> 31:13.656
- Who has locker 32?
- I'm gonna check my files.

31:22.265 --> 31:24.498
Hey, stop!

31:24.566 --> 31:26.835
It's our guy, Michelle.

31:26.902 --> 31:28.602
Cuff him.

31:28.670 --> 31:30.805
We're gonna be fingerprinting
everything in here, Sammy,

31:30.873 --> 31:32.874
so if you cooperate now,
maybe we can help you out

31:32.942 --> 31:35.076
- with the charges.
- Who did you sell GHB to?

31:35.144 --> 31:38.779
Look, my clients are
a very specific breed.

31:38.848 --> 31:40.280
I don't sell to kids,

31:40.348 --> 31:42.382
I don't sell weed or coke
or anything hardcore.

31:42.450 --> 31:45.285
- See, he's a saint. He wouldn't sell drugs.
- That's what I'm saying.

31:45.353 --> 31:48.121
These fighters are in pain, man,
a lot of pain.

31:48.189 --> 31:51.124
They fight back-to-back fights,
their injuries not fully healed.

31:51.192 --> 31:52.860
I just help 'em do their jobs,

31:52.927 --> 31:54.361
get over the pain.

31:54.428 --> 31:57.363
Right, so who did you "help"
by selling GHB to?

31:57.430 --> 31:59.832
- I don't know.
- You're facing

31:59.900 --> 32:01.734
accessory to murder, Sammy,
you know that, right?

32:01.801 --> 32:03.903
Do you really want to spend
the rest of your life in jail?

32:05.873 --> 32:07.840
It's all
through anonymous texts.

32:07.908 --> 32:10.943
I get a message
with the choice of substance

32:11.011 --> 32:12.978
and a locker number,
and I secure the product,

32:13.045 --> 32:15.713
drop it off in the locker
where the cash is waiting.

32:15.781 --> 32:18.583
It's totally anonymous.
I don't know who buys my stuff

32:18.650 --> 32:20.651
and what they do with it.

32:20.719 --> 32:24.155
- Where's your phone?
- I lost it.

32:24.223 --> 32:26.091
I'm gonna guess
it's inside your pocket.

32:26.158 --> 32:27.725
There ya go.

32:35.934 --> 32:38.202
This guy's actually smarter
than you'd think.

32:38.270 --> 32:39.870
He wiped his phone clean,

32:39.938 --> 32:42.106
but I'm gonna access
all his phone company's records.

32:44.375 --> 32:46.509
He's got every request coded.

32:46.576 --> 32:48.511
You can't decode it?

32:48.578 --> 32:50.613
Sorry, of course you can.

32:50.680 --> 32:54.083
Looks like there were three texts
sent looking to buy some goop.

32:54.151 --> 32:57.420
No, wait. One of them's
from an internet portal.

32:57.487 --> 32:59.255
Do you have an address?

32:59.323 --> 33:02.224
It's coming from a website
that sends anonymous SMS texts

33:02.292 --> 33:04.659
from the handle 1994LB.

33:04.727 --> 33:08.096
All right, I'll track
the IP address.

33:08.164 --> 33:11.300
It's coming from... 301

33:11.367 --> 33:13.235
Carrington Place Drive,

33:13.303 --> 33:17.262
which is paid for by...
Fighting Furmanek Management, Inc.

33:17.382 --> 33:19.340
Margo Furmanek.

33:19.408 --> 33:21.442
I really didn't think
she had it in her.

33:21.509 --> 33:23.945
I wish I could say the same.
Let's go.

33:32.253 --> 33:35.055
Sergeant McCluskey. I thought
I answered all your questions.

33:35.122 --> 33:36.990
We have a search warrant
for your house.

33:37.058 --> 33:38.658
I don't understand.

33:38.725 --> 33:40.626
Are you the only one
that lives here?

33:40.694 --> 33:44.630
Of course. What is this?
What do you expect to find?

33:44.698 --> 33:48.300
Someone from this house bought the drugs
that factored into your son's death.

33:48.368 --> 33:50.202
Are you insane?

33:50.270 --> 33:51.736
What, you think

33:51.804 --> 33:53.339
I drugged my own boy?

33:55.842 --> 33:58.801
We know you have the mouthguard,
Margo. Where is it?

33:58.921 --> 33:59.574
I told you,

33:59.694 --> 34:01.847
I don't know what you're
talking about.

34:05.184 --> 34:07.352
We're gonna
find that mouthguard

34:07.419 --> 34:10.521
and then we're gonna uncover what's really
going on with your family and this league.

34:10.589 --> 34:13.024
OK.

34:13.092 --> 34:15.994
OK.

34:18.230 --> 34:19.996
I did it.

34:22.433 --> 34:25.002
I killed my son.

34:29.436 --> 34:32.304
You knew Scotty wa leaving you.
You were sinking financially.

34:32.373 --> 34:36.007
- Without him, you'd have nothing.
- Yeah. You're right.

34:36.128 --> 34:38.283
Did you buy the drugs
from Sammy?

34:38.402 --> 34:40.866
Yeah. I was in the locker room
before the fight,

34:40.985 --> 34:44.706
and um... I put the drugs
in Scotty's mouthguard.

34:44.827 --> 34:47.543
So you sent your son
into that cage to die.

34:47.664 --> 34:48.815
- No.
- No?

34:48.935 --> 34:50.221
No. I...

34:50.889 --> 34:52.822
No, he wasn't supposed to die.

34:52.891 --> 34:56.659
He was... I love my boys.

34:56.728 --> 34:58.729
He was just supposed to lose.

34:58.797 --> 35:02.099
Did you or did you not
give the drugs to your son?

35:02.166 --> 35:03.800
Yeah,

35:03.868 --> 35:06.936
yeah, I switched the mouthguards
during the fight.

35:07.005 --> 35:10.140
Margo, you just said you put the drugs
in the mouthguard in the locker room?

35:10.208 --> 35:12.742
That's what I meant.
In the locker room.

35:12.810 --> 35:14.677
I don't believe you.

35:14.745 --> 35:16.678
I'm telling you the truth.

35:16.746 --> 35:19.148
I'm telling you
that I killed my son.

35:19.216 --> 35:21.350
What more do you want?

35:21.418 --> 35:23.119
Was it for the money?

35:25.322 --> 35:28.857
He was gonna leave you.

35:28.925 --> 35:33.061
- What are you not telling us?
- I'm telling you everything.

35:33.129 --> 35:36.631
I couldn't have him
break apart the family,

35:36.698 --> 35:38.466
so I, um...

35:38.534 --> 35:40.635
so I...

35:43.039 --> 35:45.540
- You still have it?
- I wasn't thinking.

35:45.607 --> 35:47.675
- I didn't know what to do.
- Just give it to me.

35:47.743 --> 35:49.143
I'll fix this.

35:52.247 --> 35:54.948
You're covering for Ian,
aren't you?

35:56.918 --> 35:58.985
No.

35:59.054 --> 36:00.954
No, I did it.

36:01.022 --> 36:02.489
It was me.

36:02.557 --> 36:05.091
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah.

36:13.767 --> 36:15.734
- She didn't do it.
- We have a confession.

36:15.802 --> 36:18.404
- She's taking the fall for Ian.
- Are you sure?

36:18.472 --> 36:21.839
Yeah. I think Ian found out that Scotty
was switching leagues and leaving Margo,

36:21.907 --> 36:23.775
and he didn't want his mother
to be upset.

36:23.842 --> 36:25.343
So he killed him?

36:25.411 --> 36:27.612
Not intentionally. I think
he just wanted him to lose.

36:27.680 --> 36:29.214
If Scotty didn't win,

36:29.282 --> 36:31.383
the contract with Kendall would
have been null and void.

36:31.451 --> 36:34.219
Exactly. And Scotty wouldn't leave the
FLC and the mother would be happy.

36:34.287 --> 36:38.122
Right now we have a mother who just confessed
to killing her son. Her fingerprints are

36:38.190 --> 36:41.825
all over the mouthguard. Unless we get a
confession from Ian, she's our prime suspect.

36:41.893 --> 36:44.828
- We have to make Ian confess.
- He's at the press conference right now.

36:44.896 --> 36:47.465
They're about to announce
the revenge fight against Diego.

36:47.532 --> 36:49.933
Why would Ian confess when he knows
his mother will take the fall?

36:50.001 --> 36:52.635
- Because it's the right thing to do.
- No, he does what he's told.

36:52.703 --> 36:55.538
If we don't make him come clean, then
the wrong person is gonna go to jail.

36:55.606 --> 36:58.341
Let's go.

37:09.285 --> 37:10.819
Ian.

37:10.886 --> 37:13.622
- We need to have a word with you.
- Not exactly a good time.

37:13.689 --> 37:16.725
- It's not gonna get any better.
- Your mother's at our headquarters.

37:16.792 --> 37:18.727
She just confessed
to killing your brother.

37:18.794 --> 37:20.762
She did what?

37:20.830 --> 37:23.098
We know she didn't do it.
We know she's taking the fall

37:23.166 --> 37:25.466
- for you, Ian.
- No.

37:25.534 --> 37:27.035
I didn't do it.

37:27.103 --> 37:29.671
I know you just wanted him
to lose.

37:32.141 --> 37:34.009
I don't know...

37:34.076 --> 37:36.477
You want your mother to spend
the rest of her life in prison

37:36.545 --> 37:38.479
because of something
that you did?

37:38.547 --> 37:42.215
There's still time
to do the right thing.

37:46.587 --> 37:49.657
I have a press conference
to go to. Excuse me.

37:53.862 --> 37:56.130
- Hey, Oz.
- Hey.

37:56.197 --> 37:59.398
You guys came for the big announcement, eh?
Michelle, I didn't know you were a fan?

37:59.466 --> 38:02.434
- I'm not.
- I want to thank you all for coming.

38:02.502 --> 38:04.403
Now, this fight is about legacy.

38:04.471 --> 38:06.605
It's about defending a name.

38:06.674 --> 38:10.643
And after the tragedy
of Scotty Furmanek's death,

38:10.711 --> 38:12.645
the Fighting Furmaneks have
a chance

38:12.712 --> 38:15.113
to rise from the ashes
with the youngest member

38:15.181 --> 38:17.515
of their dynasty.
I present to you

38:17.583 --> 38:19.084
the man himself,

38:19.152 --> 38:22.087
a legend in the making,

38:22.155 --> 38:23.655
Ian Furmanek.

38:23.723 --> 38:26.257
All right. Yeah.

38:26.325 --> 38:28.126
All right.

38:30.128 --> 38:32.596
Thank you all for coming.
Thank you, Mr. Dent.

38:32.664 --> 38:34.131
I, uh...

38:34.199 --> 38:36.934
My brother Scotty was
a great man

38:37.002 --> 38:40.037
- and a great fighter.
- Yeah.

38:40.105 --> 38:42.139
And I, um...

38:44.709 --> 38:47.343
And, uh...

38:48.008 --> 38:49.421
Ian.

38:49.713 --> 38:52.003
You OK, buddy?

38:52.799 --> 38:55.885
I have something I need to say.

38:58.222 --> 39:03.291
My brother Scotty didn't die
because of a doping scandal.

39:03.359 --> 39:06.036
He died 'cause of an accident.

39:10.934 --> 39:13.068
He died 'cause of me.

39:19.541 --> 39:21.834
Sorry, brother.

39:56.843 --> 39:58.710
Go for it. Whataya got?

39:58.779 --> 40:01.546
- Checkmate.
- Checkmate? Are you serious?

40:01.614 --> 40:04.016
I just taught you how to play,
you already me beat?

40:04.084 --> 40:06.017
Has anybody else seen...
did you see this?

40:06.085 --> 40:09.287
It was like six moves.
Have you played before?

40:09.354 --> 40:11.422
Yeah. At Sick Kids.

40:11.490 --> 40:14.425
At Sick Kids. You coulda told me that
before I taught you. Thanks a lot.

40:14.493 --> 40:16.828
You wanna go again? It's a good
thing I didn't have any money

40:16.896 --> 40:19.230
- on the table.
- Hey, Oz.

40:19.298 --> 40:21.598
- Yeah, laugh it up.
- Got a sec?

40:21.666 --> 40:23.733
Yeah. This isn't over,
by the way. I want a rematch.

40:23.802 --> 40:25.802
This kid just hustled me at chess.

40:25.922 --> 40:28.118
It's ridiculous.
He's, what, five years old?

40:28.238 --> 40:30.310
- Yeah. I got Bobby Fischered.
- Good job, buddy.

40:30.430 --> 40:32.176
Yeah, I thought I'd try
to help some of these kids

40:32.243 --> 40:34.267
- make sense of what happened.
- You're a good man.

40:34.387 --> 40:35.093
No, I know.

40:35.213 --> 40:39.182
I mean, seriously, you coming here, making
these kids laugh. That's pretty awesome.

40:39.249 --> 40:41.350
- I know. I'm incredible.
- And humble.

40:41.418 --> 40:43.953
You're not so bad yourself.
You put the right guy

40:44.021 --> 40:45.988
