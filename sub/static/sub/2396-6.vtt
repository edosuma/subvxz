09:21.360 --> 09:24.284
AND OUR WEASELLY T.A.
IS TRYING TO --

09:24.290 --> 09:26.758
I DID IT.
JEFF RATNER.

09:26.760 --> 09:31.424
RATNER.
UM, HAVE WE MET BEFORE?

09:31.430 --> 09:34.866
WE HAVE, BUT YOU PROBABLY
DON'T REMEMBER, SO WHATEVER.

09:34.870 --> 09:37.998
so, YOU REPORTED ME.
WHY --

09:38.010 --> 09:39.102
WHY?

09:39.110 --> 09:41.032
MAYBE 'CAUSE I'M
A COMMON-MAN KIND OF GUY,

09:41.040 --> 09:42.974
AND I LIKE IT
WHEN SOME TEACHER'S PET

09:42.980 --> 09:44.845
WHO'S DESTROYING THE CURVE
FOR EVERYONE

09:44.850 --> 09:46.101
GETS EXPOSED AS A CHEAT.

09:46.110 --> 09:49.614
YEAH, YOU CHEATED.
I CAUGHT YOU.

09:49.620 --> 09:51.178
DEAL WITH IT.

10:04.400 --> 10:05.594
WALLACE?

10:05.600 --> 10:06.589
NOT HERE.

10:06.600 --> 10:07.760
AND YOU WOULD BE?

10:07.770 --> 10:08.964
EVIL WALLACE.

10:08.970 --> 10:10.835
AND I KNOW VERONICA MARS
DOESN'T HANG

10:10.840 --> 10:12.398
WITH THE EVIL
AND MORALLY BANKRUPT.

10:12.410 --> 10:16.779
EVIL WALLACE WOULDN'T HAVE
CONFESSED AND FACED PUNISHMENT.

10:16.780 --> 10:18.372
NOPE,
YOU'RE REGULAR WALLACE.

10:18.380 --> 10:20.974
WELL, REGULAR WALLACE
HAS BEEN GIVEN A CHANCE

10:20.980 --> 10:23.039
TO DROP MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
SCOT-FREE,

10:23.050 --> 10:25.541
WHICH WOULD MEAN GIVING IT UP
AS MY MAJOR.

10:25.550 --> 10:28.280
I MEAN, MAN.

10:28.290 --> 10:31.782
THIS WAS THE FIRST THING
I WAS EVER INTO --

10:31.790 --> 10:34.395
FIGURING OUT
HOW STUFF WORKS.

10:35.800 --> 10:38.223
IT'S ALL
I EVER WANTED TO DO.

10:39.300 --> 10:41.234
YOU'LL WORK IT OUT.
I KNOW IT.

10:41.240 --> 10:43.231
THAT'S ALSO
VERY REGULAR WALLACE.

10:43.240 --> 10:46.869
OH, BY THE WAY, WHO'S THE GUY
YOU BOUGHT THE TEST FROM?

10:47.540 --> 10:50.338
SO, THIS WHOLE AFTER-SCHOOL-
SPECIAL MONOLOGUE HERE

10:50.350 --> 10:53.217
DIDN'T MAKE MUCH
OF AN IMPRESSION ON YOU.

10:54.720 --> 10:58.110
HIS NAME'S MAX.
HE'S IN CLARK HALL.

10:58.120 --> 11:00.259
WHY?

11:09.330 --> 11:12.561
HI, MAX?
I WAS HOPING YOU COULD HELP ME.

11:12.570 --> 11:15.892
WELL, I'M HOPING
I CAN, TOO.

11:15.900 --> 11:18.698
OKAY, SO, YOU WANT A NEW PAPER
ON MODERN FORENSICS

11:18.710 --> 11:22.271
BUT DIFFERENT ENOUGH SO THAT
HE WON'T ﬁgESS WHO --

11:22.280 --> 11:25.909
THIS PAPER OR ONE LIKE IT
IS POSTED ONLINE.

11:25.910 --> 11:27.446
I NEED TO FIND IT.

11:27.450 --> 11:30.840
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG,
BUT YOU ALREADY HAVE THAT PAPER.

11:32.350 --> 11:36.150
I TOLD YOU, MY PAPER GOT ZAPPED
BY THE PLAGIARISM SCANNER.

11:36.160 --> 11:38.253
I NEED TO FIND OUT WHY
AND FROM WHAT.

11:38.260 --> 11:40.649
OKAY, WHATEVER.

11:40.660 --> 11:42.764
UH...

11:42.770 --> 11:44.863
HMM...

11:44.870 --> 11:46.929
AH, HERE YOU GO.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.794
THAT'S MY PAPER.

11:48.800 --> 11:51.234
SEE, THAT'S WHY I NEVER
USE THESE FREE SITES --

11:51.240 --> 11:52.309
NO SECURITY.

11:52.310 --> 11:54.039
CHECKERS WILL CATCH YOU
EVERY TIME.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.406
POSTED LAST YEAR?
SOMEBODY MUST HAVE FAKED THAT.

11:56.410 --> 11:58.640
I WROTE THIS PAPER BY MYSELF
LAST WEEK.

11:58.650 --> 12:02.416
THIS MUST BE A REAL
KAFKAESQUE EXPERIENCE FOR YOU.

12:04.050 --> 12:06.018
DOES IT SAY
WHO POSTED IT?

12:06.020 --> 12:08.557
UH...

12:08.560 --> 12:12.326
rory.finch@hearstco|lege.org.

12:12.330 --> 12:15.925
THAT'S NOT YOU, IS IT?
THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

12:17.730 --> 12:20.938
AND PENCILS DOWN.

12:20.940 --> 12:22.908
BRING THEM UP.

12:25.810 --> 12:27.903
THANK YOU.

12:27.910 --> 12:30.049
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.917
I'M SORRY.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.239
WHAT ABOUT?

12:36.250 --> 12:37.808
I CALLED TIME,
AND YOU KEPT WRITING.

12:37.820 --> 12:39.082
I CAN'T ACCEPT YOUR TEST.

12:39.090 --> 12:40.648
YEAH, I WAS JUST
FINISHING MY --

12:40.660 --> 12:42.184
TIME WAS CALLED.
I'M SORRY.

12:42.190 --> 12:43.919
SO YOU KEEP SAYING, DUDE.
COME ON.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.579
MNH-MNH.

12:45.590 --> 12:47.899
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHO I AM?

12:47.900 --> 12:49.458
I DON'T,
AND I DON'T CARE.

12:49.460 --> 12:53.294
RULES ARE RULES FOR EVERYONE,
NO MATTER WHO THEY THINK --

12:59.880 --> 13:02.007
Mercer: THAT IS CLASSIC.

13:02.010 --> 13:04.444
IT WAS A PROCT OR.
THE PROFESSOR WASN'T EVEN THERE.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.771
THAT IS SO AWESOME.

13:06.780 --> 13:09.317
BUT I DO NOT CONDONE IT
IN ANY WAY

13:09.320 --> 13:12.483
AND HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOUR DECISION TO DO IT.

13:12.490 --> 13:14.048
DO WHAT?
CH EATING.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.051
I TOLD HIM IT WAS WRONG
AND HE WAS GONNA BURN IN HELL.

13:16.060 --> 13:17.527
YOU'RE GONNA BURN
IN HELL, MAN.

13:17.530 --> 13:19.327
I'LL SEE YOU THERE.

13:19.330 --> 13:20.354
YOU CH EATED?

13:20.360 --> 13:22.419
I TOOK 10 EXTRA SECONDS
ON A TEST.

13:22.430 --> 13:24.466
I THOUGHT
YOU LOVED BAD BOYS.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.392
I DO, BUT IF THAT'S
YOUR IDEA OF BAD,

13:26.400 --> 13:28.095
YOU NEED TO TURN IN
YOUR BADGE.

13:28.100 --> 13:30.330
HEY, DO YOU WANT TO GO BOWLING
TOMORROW NIGHT?

13:30.340 --> 13:33.377
SURE, UNLESS IT'S SOME "CRITICAL
ANALYSIS OF BOWLING" SEMINAR.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.905
NO, IT'S JUST WALLACE
AND HIS ROOMMATE

13:35.910 --> 13:37.241
AND SOME OTHER GUYS.

13:37.250 --> 13:39.707
COULD BE FUN.

13:39.710 --> 13:41.348
WHAT?

13:43.320 --> 13:45.880
JUST MAX HAD THIS PROJECT
ALL WEEK,

13:45.890 --> 13:47.209
AND PARKER'S ALL ALONE.

13:47.220 --> 13:49.780
I THINK WE SHOULD
INVITE HER ALONG.

13:49.790 --> 13:51.155
HOW VERY "EMMA" OF YOU.

13:51.160 --> 13:53.458
DID YOU JUST MAKE
A JANE AUSTEN REFERENCE?

13:53.460 --> 13:57.567
IT'S OFFICIAL.
THE END OF DAYS ARE UPON US.

13:59.200 --> 14:01.794
HEY, PARKER, WHAT'S UP?

14:01.800 --> 14:03.131
NOTHING.

14:03.140 --> 14:04.664
I THINK I JUST ATE
SOMETHING'S BEAK.

14:04.670 --> 14:07.400
HEY, DO YOU WANT TO COME BOWLING
WITH US TOMORROW NIGHT?

14:07.410 --> 14:09.105
BOWLING?

14:09.110 --> 14:10.247
WHY?

14:10.250 --> 14:12.070
YOU KNOW, HATCHET BURYING,
ET CETERA.

14:12.080 --> 14:13.445
PLUS, NIXON FOUND IT
SOOTHING.

14:13.450 --> 14:15.111
LOOK, IF YOU DON'T
WANT TO GO

14:15.120 --> 14:19.648
BECAUSE YOU'D RATHER SEE ME
FED TO BEARS, FINE.

14:20.760 --> 14:24.127
SO, WOULD YOU CALL THAT
AN ACCURATE DEPICT ION

14:24.130 --> 14:25.927
OF LIFE AS A PRIVATE EYE?

14:25.930 --> 14:27.090
PRETTY CLOSE.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.193
I PERSONALLY
HAVE NEVER BEEN HIRED

14:29.200 --> 14:31.293
TO LOCATE A MALTESE FALCON,
PER SE,

14:31.300 --> 14:33.996
BUT THERE WAS THE CASE
OF THE MALTESE DOG.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.831
OOH. SOLID-GOLD DOG?

14:35.840 --> 14:36.829
REAL DOG.

14:36.840 --> 14:38.239
THIS GUY GOT SOME LOWLIFE

14:38.240 --> 14:40.800
TO KIDNAP
HIS EX-WIFE'S SHOW DOG.

14:40.810 --> 14:42.368
[ LAUGHS ]

14:42.380 --> 14:44.598
NOT EXACTLY HOW I IMAGINED
THE CRIMINAL UNDERWORLD.

14:44.610 --> 14:46.919
IF THEY WERE ALL
LIKE PETER LORRE,

14:46.920 --> 14:49.639
MY JOB WOULD BE
A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING.

14:49.650 --> 14:52.084
THANKS, KEITH, FOR COMING.

14:52.090 --> 14:54.786
THESE DAYS MY HUSBAND AND I
ARE JUST LOGISTICS.

14:54.790 --> 14:58.487
I CAN'T REMEMBER THE LAST TIME
I JUST HUNG OUT AND TALKED.

14:58.490 --> 15:01.027
SURE, IT'S GREAT
TALKING TO SOMEONE

15:01.030 --> 15:03.396
FOR WHOM BOGART
ISN'T A VERB.

15:06.070 --> 15:08.436
WELL, GOOD NIGHT.

15:09.870 --> 15:12.009
[ CHUCKLES ]

15:14.610 --> 15:17.340
THE UPSIDE OF LANDING WEEVIL
THE MAINTENANCE JOB --

15:17.350 --> 15:18.749
I GET TO BABYSIT HIS KEYS

15:18.750 --> 15:20.615
WHILE HE'S AWAY
AT HIS COUSIN'S WEDDING.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.111
SO IF I WANT TO CHECK
THE HEARST E-MAIL FILES

15:23.120 --> 15:24.246
FOR RORY FINCH,

15:24.250 --> 15:25.911
I CAN DO IT ON MY OWN TIME.

15:25.920 --> 15:29.981
OF COURSE, HE DIDN'T BOTHER
TO LABEL THEM, SO...

15:48.180 --> 15:49.602
O'Dell: VERONICA?

15:51.310 --> 15:53.710
DEAN O'DELL,
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

16:01.090 --> 16:03.479
I LOST AN EARRING, UM,
AT THE MEETING,

16:03.490 --> 16:06.527
AND I WANTED TO FIND IT
BEFORE THEY VACUUMED.

16:06.530 --> 16:08.498
BUT IT WAS --

16:08.500 --> 16:12.266
WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING
YOU HAPPENED TO SHOW UP.

16:12.270 --> 16:15.330
WELL, GO AHEAD.
SEARCH AWAY.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.706
Man: MCCALL IS STARTING
TO GO STRAIGHT BACK --

16:23.710 --> 16:25.473
YOU FOLLOW BOXING?

16:25.480 --> 16:28.472
NOW YOU SEE
THE CIRCLE IS BROKEN.

16:28.480 --> 16:30.983
I ONLY FOLLOW SPORTS
THAT ARE DONE TO MUSIC.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.412
...BACK IS HITTING
THE ROPES.

16:32.420 --> 16:37.119
WOULDN'T THIS BE MORE
COMFORTABLE, SAY, AT HOME?

16:37.130 --> 16:38.722
KIND OF MY LITTLE SECRET.

16:38.730 --> 16:40.254
THE WIFE'S AGAINST IT ALL --

16:40.260 --> 16:43.468
THE SCOTCH, THE CIGARS,
THE TELEVISED VIOLENCE.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.119
SO, I KIND OF SNEAK IT IN

16:45.130 --> 16:46.688
WHENEVER SHE HAS
A CHARITY FUNCTION,

16:46.700 --> 16:48.634
A WORK FUNCTION,
WHATEVER OTHER FUNCTIONS

16:48.640 --> 16:50.699
MODERN WOMEN SEEM TO HAVE
ALL THE TIME.

16:50.710 --> 16:53.634
OOH!
THAT'S A HAYMAKER.

16:55.610 --> 16:58.477
SO, IF YOU RUN INTO HER,
YOU DIDN'T SEE ME.

16:58.480 --> 17:01.517
SOME THINGS SHE JUST
DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW.

17:01.520 --> 17:02.942
ABSOLUTELY.

17:02.950 --> 17:05.783
...IS STARTING TO BE ABLE
TO PICK HIS SHOTS.

17:05.790 --> 17:09.009
NOW, I EXPECT THESE FORMULAS
TO BE MEMORIZED

17:09.020 --> 17:10.783
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

17:12.430 --> 17:15.149
MR. FENNEL,
I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION

17:15.160 --> 17:16.457
YOU DROPPED THE CLASS.

17:16.460 --> 17:17.996
I SAID I'D THINK ABOUT IT.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.797
YOU SURE
THIS IS A SMART CHOICE?

17:19.800 --> 17:23.201
PROBABLY NOT, BUT YOU'VE SEEN
MY STAN DARDIZED TEST SCORES.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.633
I'M NOT A PARTICULARLY
SMART GUY, RIGHT?

17:25.640 --> 17:27.835
I'M TAKING A ZERO.
THERE ARE FOUR MORE TESTS.

17:27.840 --> 17:30.775
IF I AVERAGE C's OR ABOVE
ON ALL OF THEM, I'LL PASS.

17:30.780 --> 17:32.099
EVEN I CAN DO THAT MATH.

17:32.110 --> 17:34.249
OKAY, THERE YOU GO.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.552
YOU'RE GONNA RUIN YOUR EYES
WITH ALL THAT BOOK LEARNING.

17:44.560 --> 17:48.155
I STAYED IN WINKLER'S CLASS.
I TOOK THE ZERO.

17:49.700 --> 17:50.724
I NEED TO STUDY.

17:50.730 --> 17:53.164
I SUSPECT ED
THAT MIGHT HAPPEN.

17:53.170 --> 17:55.695
SO, YOU FIGURE OUT

17:55.700 --> 17:58.203
WHAT WAS UP
WITH THAT PLAGIARISM THING?

17:58.210 --> 18:00.599
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
A PAPER JUST LIKE MINE

18:00.610 --> 18:04.706
WAS POSTED ONLINE BY
roryflnch@hearstcol|ege.org '-

18:04.710 --> 18:06.007
A HEARST E-MAIL,

18:06.010 --> 18:07.716
BUT THERE'S NEVER BEEN
A STUDENT BY THAT NAME.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.711
THE ADDRESS WAS SET UP
THREE DAYS AGO

18:09.720 --> 18:13.611
FROM AN I.P. ADDRESS AT --
GET THIS -- THE NEPTUNE GRAND.

18:13.620 --> 18:16.316
AFTER YOU TURNED IN
YOUR PAPER.

18:16.320 --> 18:18.788
SO, YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK.
IT'S OVER.

18:18.790 --> 18:21.827
AH, MY INNOCENT
AND NAIVE WALLACE.

18:21.830 --> 18:23.388
WHEN I FIND OUT WHO DID THIS

18:23.400 --> 18:25.823
AND I MAKE THEM SING
LIKE THE PROVERBIAL FAT LADY,

18:25.830 --> 18:28.230
THAT'S WHEN IT'S OVER.

18:28.240 --> 18:30.731
OKAY, YOU'RE ROCKY.

18:30.740 --> 18:32.628
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING
IS MR. T.

18:32.640 --> 18:34.505
"EYE OF THE TIGER"
IS PLAYING.

18:34.510 --> 18:36.000
I'LL SEE YOU LATER ON.

18:36.010 --> 18:37.875
YEAH.

18:37.880 --> 18:39.609
WHAT?

18:39.610 --> 18:40.872
WHEN?

18:42.820 --> 18:45.186
BOOM. I'M SET.

18:45.190 --> 18:47.784
ARE YOU READY
FOR A NIGHT OF BOWLING, HUH?

18:47.790 --> 18:49.348
FUN, FUN, FUN.

18:49.360 --> 18:53.399
FUN? I'M PRETTY SURE I WON'T
EVER BE HAVING FUN AGAIN.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.095
AH, DAMN, THAT'S TONIGHT.

18:55.100 --> 18:56.795
I'M SORRY, MAN,
BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

18:56.800 --> 18:58.961
NO, DUDE, YOU HAVE TO G0.
I INVITED VERONICA.

18:58.970 --> 19:01.768
I SAID THERE'S A WHOLE GANG
GOING, INCLUDING YOU.

19:01.770 --> 19:02.862
SO, IF YOU'RE NOT THERE --

19:02.870 --> 19:05.168
IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE
YOU ASKED HER OUT.

19:06.010 --> 19:08.001
YEAH, THAT SOUNDS AWKWARD.

19:08.010 --> 19:11.241
BUT IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM.
THIS IS.

19:13.680 --> 19:14.749
HEY, DAD.

19:14.750 --> 19:16.570
HEY, HONEY.

19:16.580 --> 19:20.118
SO, TOMORROW'S
"OUT OF THE PAST."

19:20.120 --> 19:21.758
IT'S ONE
OF MY ALL-TIME FAVORITES.

19:21.760 --> 19:24.024
I'VE GOT A CONFERENCE
AT THE NEPTUNE GRAND.

19:24.030 --> 19:25.588
I DON'T THINK
I'M GONNA BE FREE,

19:25.590 --> 19:27.421
BUT I'D LIKE TO DO
SOMETHING ELSE.

19:27.430 --> 19:29.955
OKAY, WELL, KEEP ME POSTED.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.393
BYE.

19:31.400 --> 19:35.029
SO, FOR BOWLING,
"EARNEST, I'M REALLY BOWLING"

19:35.040 --> 19:38.498
OR "I'M TOO COOL FOR BOWLING,
AND I'M ONLY HERE IRONICALLY"?

19:38.510 --> 19:40.137
WHEN DID CRAPPY OLD SHIRTS

19:40.140 --> 19:42.677
WITH STUPID STUFF ON THEM
BECOME COOL?

19:42.680 --> 19:45.899
I DON'T KNOW
WHY I ASK YOU THESE THINGS.
