WEBVTT

00:01.305 --> 00:02.959
- Nice poster, Reverend Jax.

00:03.003 --> 00:04.613
- Thank you, Dwayne.

00:04.656 --> 00:06.484
We exceeded our constructionpaper budget for the year,

00:06.528 --> 00:07.920
so I moved some money around,

00:07.964 --> 00:10.097
took it outof double-sided tape--

00:10.140 --> 00:11.837
Does anybody haveany double-sided tape

00:11.881 --> 00:12.925
I could borrow?

00:12.969 --> 00:14.231
- We are going to Lexington.

00:14.275 --> 00:15.754
It's gonna be so fun.

00:15.798 --> 00:16.929
- Fun?
No.

00:16.973 --> 00:18.844
This is David versus Goliath.

00:18.888 --> 00:22.065
Pastor Magnus and his choir
think that they can beat us,

00:22.109 --> 00:25.112
but we're not the same choir
we were six months ago, are we?

00:25.155 --> 00:27.418
- Hell no!This time I know the songs.

00:27.462 --> 00:28.941
And the real words,

00:28.985 --> 00:30.421
not just cheating offother people's mouths.

00:30.465 --> 00:32.510
- I wasn't looking
for actual answers.

00:32.554 --> 00:34.077
This is about more than music.

00:34.121 --> 00:36.210
This is about
moxie versus money.

00:36.253 --> 00:37.515
choir: Yeah.

00:37.559 --> 00:39.082
- This is about sincerity
versus hypocrisy.

00:40.823 --> 00:42.738
- This is about persistence
versus privilege.

00:42.781 --> 00:44.305
- Amen!
- All right.

00:44.348 --> 00:45.958
- This is about you
beating the guy

00:46.002 --> 00:48.135
who wouldn't let you bury
your wife in his cemetery.

00:48.178 --> 00:50.224
- And he kissed her.

00:50.267 --> 00:53.357
- And it is naive to think
it stopped at a kiss.

00:53.401 --> 00:55.968
- All right, can we--
- He did say Jean was kinky.

00:57.535 --> 00:59.320
- Uh, can we bring it in,please!

00:59.363 --> 01:02.149
The point is, I didn't stayin the cultural ass-crack

01:02.192 --> 01:04.542
of America's armpitin order to lose.

01:04.586 --> 01:07.197
So clear your schedulesfor the next five days,

01:07.241 --> 01:08.459
because you're mine.

01:08.503 --> 01:10.766
- Now is the armpit
in the ass-crack,

01:10.809 --> 01:13.943
or is the ass-crack
in the armpit?

01:16.946 --> 01:19.731
choir: ♪ Hallelujah,
Thine the glory ♪

01:19.775 --> 01:25.128
♪ Revive us again

01:25.172 --> 01:27.348

01:27.391 --> 01:29.263
- You ready to blow?!
choir: Yeah!

01:29.306 --> 01:33.267
- Three, two, one, blow!

01:35.312 --> 01:37.358

- Let's do this!

02:24.274 --> 02:25.971
- Whoo!
- Hey, guys,

02:26.015 --> 02:28.104
the bus will be here
any second, and remember

02:28.148 --> 02:31.847
it is a tight squeeze, so only
one bag per person, okay?

02:31.890 --> 02:33.631
- One bag?That's impossible.

02:33.675 --> 02:36.112
What if I'm going froman afternoon of athleisure

02:36.156 --> 02:37.853
to a smart casual dinner?

02:37.896 --> 02:39.898
- Just wear the same cardigan
you always wear.

02:39.942 --> 02:42.858
- This is new.

02:44.686 --> 02:46.601
- Who coughed?

02:49.473 --> 02:51.432
Seriously, is somebody sick?

02:51.475 --> 02:53.999
'Cause if somebody's sick,they need to go home.

02:54.043 --> 02:55.871
- You would leavesomebody behind?

02:55.914 --> 02:57.655
- We are a herd of antelope,

02:57.699 --> 03:01.442
and that cough is a lion
that is chasing us.

03:01.485 --> 03:03.661
So you know
what we're gonna do?

03:05.489 --> 03:09.276
We're gonna sacrifice
the weak link,

03:09.319 --> 03:13.280
so that the lion will feast
upon that carcass

03:13.323 --> 03:15.891
and the rest of us
might survive.

03:15.934 --> 03:18.459
I'll be watching,

03:18.502 --> 03:20.809
and I'll be listening.

03:20.852 --> 03:22.289
- I'm gonna go see

03:22.332 --> 03:24.900
if Reverend Jax needs
some help with his bag.

03:24.943 --> 03:27.381
- Appreciate it, Dwayne.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.472
- You didn't make the cut.
I'm sorry.

03:31.515 --> 03:34.605
- Dwayne, are you okay?

03:34.649 --> 03:36.433
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

03:36.477 --> 03:38.479
I needed to eliminate
an outfit.

03:38.522 --> 03:40.611
So long, impromptu baptism.

03:40.655 --> 03:42.396
Can you keep a secret?

03:42.439 --> 03:43.614
- What, that you're sick?

03:43.658 --> 03:45.312
I can keep that secret.
Can you?

03:47.009 --> 03:48.924
- Okay, new plan:
When you need to cough,

03:48.967 --> 03:50.491
just tap your chin
with your finger,

03:50.534 --> 03:52.493
and I'll create a diversion.

03:52.536 --> 03:54.669
- Hey, uh, Reverend Jax--
- Ginny!

03:54.712 --> 03:57.759
♪ Ginny, bo-binny,
banana-fana-fo-finny ♪

03:57.802 --> 04:00.936
♪ Fi-fi-fo-finny, Ginny
- I like that.

04:00.979 --> 04:02.459
Um, oh wait, wait.

04:02.503 --> 04:04.505
Did the bus company call
and say why they're late?

04:04.548 --> 04:07.508
I have to be at the hotel
by 6:00 for a job interview.

04:07.551 --> 04:09.379
- In Lexington?Would you have to move?

04:09.423 --> 04:11.381
- Yes, but it's just
an interview,

04:11.425 --> 04:12.730
and I probably won't get it.

04:12.774 --> 04:14.515
I just--I don't want
Adams to find out.

04:14.558 --> 04:17.561
She is my current boss
and my forever friend.

04:17.605 --> 04:19.302
She's my boss friend.
- Reverend Jax.

04:19.346 --> 04:22.479
- Oh, come on,
it's only two days!

04:22.523 --> 04:24.394
You don't need
a turquoise bolo!

04:25.787 --> 04:27.397
- Thank you, Ginny.

04:27.441 --> 04:30.182
So long
"antiquing with Ashley Judd."

04:30.226 --> 04:31.401
- Could you do me a favor?

04:31.445 --> 04:32.533
When we get to Lexington,

04:32.576 --> 04:34.317
I need to duck out
for a moment.

04:34.361 --> 04:36.406
Could you cover for me?
- Of course.

04:36.450 --> 04:38.103
Anything you need to discuss?

04:38.147 --> 04:39.888
- You need to pack
some drawers.

04:41.368 --> 04:43.370
I guess this will be
a commando trip.

04:43.413 --> 04:46.329
God's love is all the support
I need.

04:46.373 --> 04:49.158
- Now don't unplug Gram-Gram,
no matter how mean she is.

04:49.201 --> 04:50.768
- Or how many timesshe asks you.

04:50.812 --> 04:52.335
- Mm-hmm--oh.

04:53.815 --> 04:55.512
Son of a biscuit!
- What's wrong?

04:55.556 --> 04:57.514
- Our bus broke down, and
they can't get a replacement

04:57.558 --> 04:58.515
until tonight.

04:58.559 --> 04:59.734
- Sounds like sabotage.

04:59.777 --> 05:01.126
You think Magnusis behind this?

05:01.170 --> 05:02.432
- Arthur, focus!

05:02.476 --> 05:04.173
We gotta be in Lexington
by 6:00 PM.

05:05.522 --> 05:07.698
For team building purposes.

05:07.742 --> 05:09.570
- Well, my buddy Dookie
might be able to help.

05:09.613 --> 05:10.788
He has a bus.

05:10.832 --> 05:13.225
- I'm leery of any plan thathinges on a man named "Dookie,"

05:13.269 --> 05:14.575
but how bad can it be?

05:16.403 --> 05:18.796
- Dookie just has to drop these
kids off at the Winter Formal,

05:18.840 --> 05:20.363
and then we're good to go.

05:20.407 --> 05:22.713
- Tell your friend
to drive faster, Dookie!

05:22.757 --> 05:25.455
No more stopping for fake IDs.

05:25.499 --> 05:26.978
- You look familiar.

05:27.022 --> 05:28.763
- I was Snowflake Queenin 19--

05:28.806 --> 05:31.505
- No, you're the lady
that murdered her husband.

05:31.548 --> 05:34.029
Do you do stepdads?
I hate Rick.

05:34.072 --> 05:36.379
- Honey, you can't afford me.

05:36.423 --> 05:38.250
- No, don't answer that!

05:38.294 --> 05:39.600
- Pastor Magnus!

05:39.643 --> 05:42.298
I'm so honored
that you have my phone number!

05:42.342 --> 05:44.605
- I hear you're having
transportation issues.

05:44.648 --> 05:46.041
- How does he kn--

05:46.084 --> 05:48.478
Quinn, will you get offsocial media!

05:48.522 --> 05:49.610
- They're my only friends!

05:49.653 --> 05:52.613
- If you need
to back out of regionals,

05:52.656 --> 05:54.528
I'm sure everyone
would understand.

05:54.571 --> 05:57.182
- Oh, you would love that,wouldn't you?

05:57.226 --> 06:00.490
You're looking at the faceof the next regional champion!

06:00.534 --> 06:03.406
- You got
a little something here.

06:03.450 --> 06:05.669
- ♪ Oh, Lord,
my God ♪

06:10.848 --> 06:13.111
- Hi, hello, hi.

06:13.155 --> 06:14.504
Hi, my name is Ginny Hawlings

06:14.548 --> 06:16.071
and I have a six o'clock
appointment with Brian.

06:16.114 --> 06:17.507
- Brian's dead.

06:17.551 --> 06:19.596
- Oh, sorry.I wish Brian was dead.

06:19.640 --> 06:20.858
I was daydreaming.

06:20.902 --> 06:22.469
He just deniedmy vacation days.

06:22.512 --> 06:23.470
- Oh.

06:23.513 --> 06:25.689
- But you might be ableto catch him in the garage.

06:25.733 --> 06:26.777
- Vacation days.
That must be nice.

06:26.821 --> 06:28.431
Wait, garage, garage, garage,
garage...

06:28.475 --> 06:29.650
- Just text me the address.

06:29.693 --> 06:30.999
I should be ableto get out of here in an hour.

06:31.042 --> 06:33.218
- Going somewhere?
- Yeah.

06:33.262 --> 06:36.483
I'm going to 1253Mind Your Business Avenue.

06:36.526 --> 06:38.441
- Okay.
- Hey, what's going on?

06:38.485 --> 06:40.878
- We booked ten rooms.How can there only be five?

06:40.922 --> 06:42.489
- There's a choral competitionin town.

06:42.532 --> 06:43.794
- Yeah.

06:43.838 --> 06:44.795
- I know, it sounds stupid,

06:44.839 --> 06:45.883
but some people are into that.

06:47.189 --> 06:49.844
- Aw, you guys
just can't catch a break.

06:49.887 --> 06:52.368
It's like that saying,
"the rich get richer."

06:52.412 --> 06:53.674
But the opposite.
- What a shock.

06:53.717 --> 06:55.893
Someone from Perpetual Praise
is gloating.

06:55.937 --> 06:59.375
Hang on, is Magnus behind
this room thing?

06:59.419 --> 07:01.595
- Yes, he's obsessed with you.
You're all he talks about.

07:01.638 --> 07:04.249
Oh, wait, no.
That's Jesus.

07:04.293 --> 07:05.947
- Right, that zombieyou all worship.

07:05.990 --> 07:08.732
- Well, looks like you and Iare gonna have to share a bed.

07:08.776 --> 07:10.908
You wanna be the big spoon
or the little spoon?

07:10.952 --> 07:12.170
Who are we kidding?

07:12.214 --> 07:13.911
We both knowyou're little spoon.

07:13.955 --> 07:16.566
- As much as I believe
platonic cuddling is the answer

07:16.610 --> 07:19.569
to all of life's problems,
I gotta come clean.

07:19.613 --> 07:22.180
I got a cold, and I don't want
Arthur sending me home.

07:22.224 --> 07:25.575
- Why didn't you tell me?I have the perfect cure.

07:25.619 --> 07:28.186
On a scale of one to ten,what's your pain tolerance?

07:29.579 --> 07:31.363
- Brian?

07:31.407 --> 07:34.062
Hi, I'm Ginny.

07:34.105 --> 07:35.498
From the phone.
- Oh.

07:35.542 --> 07:36.934
- I am so sorry that I was late

07:36.978 --> 07:38.762
to our interview,
but I can talk now.

07:38.806 --> 07:40.285
- Well, I can't.

07:40.329 --> 07:41.504
I'm meeting my motherfor drinks.

07:41.548 --> 07:43.114
Don't ask.

07:43.158 --> 07:46.814
- What a coincidence.
My other car is a TARDIS too.

07:48.206 --> 07:50.731
- You a big "Doctor Who" fan?- Oh, my God, are you kidding?

07:50.774 --> 07:53.560
My mama always said I should
marry a doctor, and I said,

07:53.603 --> 07:55.562
"Only if it's Doctor Who."

07:55.605 --> 07:57.302
- Can you come back tomorrowat 11:00?

07:57.346 --> 07:59.740
- 11:00?
That's my middle name.

07:59.783 --> 08:02.351
That was a joke.
It's 12:00.

08:02.394 --> 08:04.745
That was also a joke.
It's JoAnne.

08:04.788 --> 08:06.529
I'm actually really nervous.
It's Trish.

08:08.618 --> 08:10.315
- You know, I had a feeling
you were sick.

08:10.359 --> 08:11.534
We're connected, brother.

08:11.578 --> 08:13.754
Like when one twin gets hurt
and the other feels it.

08:13.797 --> 08:15.799
Now, this might burn a little.

08:15.843 --> 08:17.671
- 'Cause it's hot water?
- Because it's grain alcohol.

08:17.714 --> 08:19.934
- Aah, gah.

08:19.977 --> 08:22.153
- Ooh, our nose!

08:25.374 --> 08:26.767
- Check it out.

08:26.810 --> 08:27.942
I changedthe sound check times.

08:27.985 --> 08:30.553
I swapped our timewith Perpetual Praise

08:30.597 --> 08:31.728
so they're gonna missrehearsal,

08:31.772 --> 08:33.208
and we're gonna getdouble.

08:33.251 --> 08:36.385
Payback's a bitch,and I am high on life.

08:36.428 --> 08:37.778
- Have you been drinking?

08:37.821 --> 08:39.823
- Just a bunch
of mini-bar bourbons

08:39.867 --> 08:41.564
and that Five Hour Energy

08:41.608 --> 08:44.175
that looked a hell of a lot
like a mini-bar bourbon.

08:44.219 --> 08:45.916
- 11:00?
Oh, no, no, no.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.396
That won't work.
- Why not?

08:47.439 --> 08:49.224
- Don't freak out.
- Mm-kay.

08:49.267 --> 08:50.921
- But I have a job interview.

08:50.965 --> 08:52.793
It would mean a raise,

08:52.836 --> 08:54.142
and health insurance,

08:54.185 --> 08:55.404
even dental.

08:55.447 --> 08:57.275
I could stop
wearing Cash's old retainer.

08:57.319 --> 08:58.973
- Yeah, you should definitely
stop doing that

08:59.016 --> 09:00.931
'cause that's really gross.

09:00.975 --> 09:02.629
You have to reschedule.
You're the soloist.

09:02.672 --> 09:04.631
- You don't understand how much
this means to me.

09:04.674 --> 09:05.588
- To you?
- Mm-hmm.

09:05.632 --> 09:06.937
- Obliterating Magnus

09:06.981 --> 09:08.591
is the reason I stayed here--

09:08.635 --> 09:11.246
you convinced me to lead
this choir,

09:11.289 --> 09:12.639
and you're not sticking it out?

09:12.682 --> 09:14.989
- I don't want to leave
Conley Fork.

09:15.032 --> 09:18.035
My Gram-Gram would destroy me
on social media.

09:18.079 --> 09:20.690
But you're the one who told me
to dream bigger.

09:20.734 --> 09:22.997
- No, don't blame me
for your selfishness.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.826
- So wanting what's best
for my family is selfish?

09:25.869 --> 09:27.741
- Deserting people
who are depending on you

09:27.784 --> 09:28.829
is selfish, yes.

09:28.872 --> 09:31.048
- I think you should leave.

09:31.092 --> 09:32.789
Go on.
Git.

09:32.833 --> 09:35.618
- Don't you mean "get?"
- I mean git.

09:35.662 --> 09:39.317
It rhymes with "stuck-up
piece of ."

09:41.668 --> 09:43.713
- Appreciate the hospitality.

09:46.498 --> 09:47.891
- Maybe if I offered
mixed nuts,

09:47.935 --> 09:51.503
people would open up
to me more.

09:51.547 --> 09:53.288
- Taxi!
- I have to go.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.815
- ♪ Ah

09:58.859 --> 10:01.513
♪ I get to know your name

10:03.298 --> 10:05.866
♪ Well, if I

10:05.909 --> 10:08.651
♪ Could trace your private
number, baby ♪

10:08.695 --> 10:11.306
- Rev?

10:11.349 --> 10:12.873
Did you follow me here?

10:12.916 --> 10:13.874
- Yes.

10:13.917 --> 10:15.049
But only because I care.

10:15.092 --> 10:16.877
I don't understand
why you don't trust me.

10:16.920 --> 10:19.053
Everyone else in the church
thinks I'm a good pastor

10:19.096 --> 10:20.445
now that Bernice is dead.

10:20.489 --> 10:21.882
- Please welcome to the stage

10:21.925 --> 10:24.275
Madame Adams!

10:24.319 --> 10:27.931
- Hello, my beautiful babies!

10:27.975 --> 10:29.890
I'm Madame Adams,

10:29.933 --> 10:33.284
and I've been keeping it tight
since 19--.

10:34.590 --> 10:35.852
- That man is doing
an impression of you.

10:35.896 --> 10:39.334
Does he know you?
- That's my husband, Keith.

10:39.377 --> 10:41.336
- Your dead husband is alive?

10:41.379 --> 10:44.121
- No, my alive husbandwho's about to be dead.

10:44.165 --> 10:46.123
You stole my life!

10:46.167 --> 10:47.342
And my dress!

10:47.385 --> 10:49.387
- I look like a young Beyoncé.

10:49.431 --> 10:51.389
- Damn it, he's really
pulling it off.

10:54.958 --> 10:56.917
- ♪ For spacious skies

10:56.960 --> 10:57.744
- So your big secret

10:57.787 --> 10:59.528
is that you didn't murder
your husband?

10:59.571 --> 11:00.703
- His parents are conservative.

11:00.747 --> 11:02.923
They were
never gonna accept him.

11:02.966 --> 11:06.491
He had to leave Conley Fork
to be who he is!

11:06.535 --> 11:08.624
So I said I'd cover for him.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.713
I do not warble like that.

11:10.757 --> 11:13.281
- So now I know why you never
denied the murder rumors.

11:13.324 --> 11:14.848
You were protecting Keith.

11:14.891 --> 11:16.937
That's very noble.

11:16.980 --> 11:19.766
- I'm Madame Adams,
the owner of this club

11:19.809 --> 11:21.724
and the mineral rights below.

11:21.768 --> 11:24.292
- He's like a younger you.

11:24.335 --> 11:25.859
He's like an older you.

11:25.902 --> 11:27.991
He doesn't look like you.

11:28.035 --> 11:30.167
- So glad you made it.

11:30.211 --> 11:31.168
Who's your friend?

11:31.212 --> 11:32.779
- I'm Reverend Jax,

11:32.822 --> 11:33.997
her beloved
and trusted pastor

11:34.041 --> 11:35.390
and also her best friend!

11:35.433 --> 11:36.739
- He followed me here.

11:36.783 --> 11:37.958
- So he's from Conley Fork,

11:38.001 --> 11:40.090
where people still believe
I'm dead.

11:40.134 --> 11:41.439
Until now.

11:41.483 --> 11:44.355
- That's what I wantedto talk to you about.

11:47.271 --> 11:49.447
I met someone.
- That's amazing!

11:49.491 --> 11:51.972
- Except,
because of our secret,

11:52.015 --> 11:53.538
he thinks I'm a murderer.

11:53.582 --> 11:55.105
- That gives you the upper hand
in the relationship.

11:55.149 --> 11:57.978
I don't see the problem.
- Secrets can be a real burden.

11:58.021 --> 11:59.196
- Oh, really?

11:59.240 --> 12:02.634
I wouldn't know that as
a gay black man in Kentucky.

12:02.678 --> 12:06.421
- Listen, I am gladthat you got to start over,

12:06.464 --> 12:08.031
but my new life can't start

12:08.075 --> 12:10.033
until people in Conley Forkknow the truth.

12:10.077 --> 12:11.818
- I'm just not ready yet.

12:11.861 --> 12:13.602
So, if you'll excuse me,

12:13.645 --> 12:15.865
I have to get ready
for the next show.

12:15.909 --> 12:17.388
- Let's go.

12:17.432 --> 12:20.435
- I kind of ordered
some huevos rancheros.

12:22.263 --> 12:24.787
- Hello again...

12:24.831 --> 12:25.962
- Jan.

12:26.006 --> 12:28.704
- Jan, Jan, ba-bam,
banana-fana-fo-fam--

12:28.748 --> 12:30.924
I am back for my interview
with Brian.

12:30.967 --> 12:34.928
- Brian's behind schedule,
but you can have a seat.

12:34.971 --> 12:38.801
- Oh.

12:38.845 --> 12:41.673
- This place is big as hell!

12:41.717 --> 12:42.674
- Or heaven.

12:42.718 --> 12:44.981
- Anybody else feel small?

12:45.025 --> 12:47.114
- Welcome to my world, buddy.

12:53.033 --> 12:55.426
- A burp would echo so loud
in here.

12:57.124 --> 12:58.952
- Don't be intimidated.

12:58.995 --> 13:00.301
Quinn, do me a favor.

13:00.344 --> 13:03.957
Stand by that back riser.
Where's that come up?

13:04.000 --> 13:06.263
Comes up right to his hip,
don't they?

13:06.307 --> 13:08.396
- He's right.
They do!

13:08.439 --> 13:09.701
What's that mean?

13:09.745 --> 13:11.225
- It means they are
the same height

13:11.268 --> 13:12.704
as the ones we've been
practicing on

13:12.748 --> 13:13.705
in Conley Fork.

13:13.749 --> 13:15.011
Adams, touch those robes.

13:15.055 --> 13:17.013
- A random rack of robes that
could belong to vagabonds?

13:17.057 --> 13:19.842
No thank you.
- Junior.

13:19.886 --> 13:21.975
- Feels like a polyester blend.

13:22.018 --> 13:24.020
Low viscosity.
10% rayon, max.

13:24.064 --> 13:25.892
- It's the same material
as our cheap choir robes,

13:25.935 --> 13:26.893
am I right?

13:26.936 --> 13:27.894
- Yes.
- They are.

13:27.937 --> 13:29.025
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

13:29.069 --> 13:31.071
- I want this win
against Magnus

13:31.114 --> 13:33.856
more than anything,
and I know you do too.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.553
Every one of you.

13:35.597 --> 13:36.946
- Except Ginny.

13:36.990 --> 13:38.774
Where is she?

13:48.915 --> 13:50.438
- Excuse me,
where is the bathroom?

13:50.481 --> 13:52.005
Oh, is it right here?
Thank you so much.

13:52.048 --> 13:55.312
You've been great!
- That's where Brian is--

13:55.356 --> 13:57.358
- Brian, I am withdrawing
my application,

13:57.401 --> 13:58.881
which is your loss

13:58.925 --> 14:00.970
because I am the best candidate
for this position,

14:01.014 --> 14:03.451
because unlike you,
I am punctual.

14:03.494 --> 14:05.801
And I'm honest, which is why
I'm gonna tell you

14:05.845 --> 14:06.889
I watched "Doctor Who,"

14:06.933 --> 14:08.238
and it makes absolutely
no sense.

14:08.282 --> 14:10.458
I mean, the bad guys
are trash cans.

14:10.501 --> 14:12.155
Now, if you'll excuse me,

14:12.199 --> 14:14.592
I have somewhere more important
to be.

14:14.636 --> 14:16.856
Good luck finding a better
assistant manager than me.

14:18.945 --> 14:22.513
- But I'm
the assistant manager.

14:22.557 --> 14:25.516
- That's why I called you
in here, Gary.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.605
- Okay, I know this is just
sound check,

14:27.649 --> 14:28.824
but I want you
to put everything

14:28.868 --> 14:30.086
into these two numbers.

14:30.130 --> 14:32.567
I want to blow Magnus' toupeeso far off his head,

14:32.610 --> 14:34.830
it lands in the woodsand squirrels nest in it.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.701
Can I get an amen?

14:36.745 --> 14:38.921
all: Amen!

14:38.965 --> 14:40.618
- Guys!Guys, I'm here.

14:40.662 --> 14:42.011
I'm here.

14:42.055 --> 14:43.926
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry that I'm late.

14:43.970 --> 14:46.059
That was for them
and not for you.

14:46.102 --> 14:47.408
- Girl, what are you wearing?

14:47.451 --> 14:49.976
You look like
a court-appointed attorney.

14:50.019 --> 14:51.107
- Let's hit it.

14:53.240 --> 14:55.416
- We are the reigning,
reigning, reigning champions,

14:55.459 --> 14:57.026
and we would not miss
our sound check.

14:59.463 --> 15:01.378
I have in my hand

15:01.422 --> 15:03.815
a schedule that says
you changed our time

15:37.458 --> 15:39.329
This was supposed to beour time!

15:39.373 --> 15:41.418
- Your sound check
was an hour ago.

15:41.462 --> 15:42.985
You missed it,
so they skipped you.

15:43.029 --> 15:44.987
- He that worketh deceit

15:45.031 --> 15:46.858
shall not dwell

our bus

15:49.209 --> 15:50.601
and stole our hotel rooms.

15:50.645 --> 15:52.212
- I have no idea
what you're talking about.

15:52.255 --> 15:55.084
- Yeah, well, do you remember
denying my wife's dying wish

15:55.128 --> 15:56.607
to be buried in your cemetery?

15:56.651 --> 16:00.002
- I have asked Godto help me like you,

16:00.046 --> 16:02.048
but some prayerswill go unanswered.

16:02.091 --> 16:05.007
- Yeah, well, imaginary friends
are so unreliable.

16:05.051 --> 16:07.227
Pray as hard as you want.
You're gonna lose.

16:14.060 --> 16:15.235
Medic!

16:15.278 --> 16:17.150
- What--no, no, I'm fine!
I'm fine--

16:17.193 --> 16:18.586
- I got you buddy.

16:18.629 --> 16:20.892
Rest easy in my jacked arms.

16:20.936 --> 16:22.764
Nope, I can't do it.
Too huge, going down!

16:26.333 --> 16:28.900
- Oh, my God,
did I just kill Magnus?

16:28.944 --> 16:30.032
- No, he's not dead,

16:30.076 --> 16:32.252
and a lot of things can cause
a heart attack.

16:32.295 --> 16:33.949
- This is all your fault!

16:33.993 --> 16:35.603
I need to go in the ambulance
with him

16:35.646 --> 16:37.735
to keep his hair on straight.

16:37.779 --> 16:38.910
It's what he would want.

16:38.954 --> 16:40.477
- I spoke to the other pastors.

16:40.521 --> 16:42.958
We decided out of respect
for Pastor Magnus,

16:43.002 --> 16:44.481
we should cancel regionals.

16:44.525 --> 16:46.048
I'll tell the choir.

16:46.092 --> 16:47.093
- Are you okay?

16:47.136 --> 16:48.659
- Worst thing in the worldjust happened

16:48.703 --> 16:49.660
to the person I hate most.

16:49.704 --> 16:52.185
You think I'd be happy,but I'm sad.

16:52.228 --> 16:53.925
- Well, of course you are.
You're not a monster.

16:53.969 --> 16:55.057
- Oh, really?

16:55.101 --> 16:58.234
I tried to keep you from takinga shot at a better life.

16:58.278 --> 17:00.236
- Oof, doesn't matter.

17:00.280 --> 17:03.065
I screwed it up, and I am sure
that I will not get it.

17:03.109 --> 17:04.284
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Mm.

17:04.327 --> 17:05.285
- Back to me.

17:05.328 --> 17:06.851
What the hell am I supposedto do?

17:06.895 --> 17:08.288
I mean, ever since Jean died,

17:08.331 --> 17:11.247
revenge is the only thingthat's been keeping me going.

17:11.291 --> 17:13.945
- Well, on the surface, maybe.

17:13.989 --> 17:17.253
But underneath, I mean,
wasn't it about friendship

17:17.297 --> 17:21.214
and community and the joy
of making music with us?

17:21.257 --> 17:22.345
- Nah.

17:22.389 --> 17:24.434
I don't livein Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood.

17:24.478 --> 17:26.262
Unless there's a bar.

17:30.353 --> 17:32.747
- Yep, kind of a bummer
we don't get to perform.

17:32.790 --> 17:35.358
Dookie was really
looking forward to it.

17:35.402 --> 17:37.752
- I know a place we mightbe able to perform.

17:37.795 --> 17:40.015
Just need to make a call.
- Great.

17:40.059 --> 17:42.104
I don't know what those
paramedics shot me full of,

17:42.148 --> 17:43.323
but I feel like singing,
dancing,

17:43.366 --> 17:45.716
or getting slapped
in the face.

17:45.760 --> 17:46.891
Whoo!

17:46.935 --> 17:48.545
Now that's what
I'm talking about, baby.

17:52.027 --> 17:53.681
- Are you sure you're ready
for this?

17:53.724 --> 17:54.682
- Absolutely.

17:54.725 --> 17:55.944
I thought about it,

17:55.987 --> 17:57.902
and I'm proud of the person
I've become.

17:57.946 --> 18:00.340
It's about time I showed him
to the world.

18:00.383 --> 18:01.993
And thank you for not
murdering me.

18:04.822 --> 18:06.389
- Come on in!

18:06.433 --> 18:07.999
Y'all remember Keith?

18:08.043 --> 18:09.697
My ex-husband who moved
to Lexington

18:09.740 --> 18:11.002
to open a drag club,

18:11.046 --> 18:12.569
but didn't want anyonein Conley Fork to know,

18:12.613 --> 18:15.224
so he faked his death and leteveryone think I'm a murderer?

18:15.268 --> 18:17.226
- Surprise!

18:20.751 --> 18:22.362
- You look amazing!
- Well, thank you, thank you.

18:22.405 --> 18:23.972
Okay, look, look, look,
look, look, look.

18:24.015 --> 18:25.016
We can catch up later.

18:25.060 --> 18:26.279
Right now, I have
an empty stage,

18:26.322 --> 18:28.150
and you have a performance
to give.

18:28.194 --> 18:29.586
Come on, I'll show you
where to go.

18:29.630 --> 18:31.414
- Ooh.

18:31.458 --> 18:35.026
Are we gonna sing
"Ave Maria" here?

18:35.070 --> 18:38.421
- Well, maybe.

18:38.465 --> 18:39.596
With a twist.

18:41.032 --> 18:41.990
Oh.

18:42.033 --> 18:43.165
Hello?

18:43.209 --> 18:46.037
- Ginny, it's Brian
from the Lexington Inn.

18:46.081 --> 18:47.169
- Oh, before you say anything,

18:47.213 --> 18:50.041
I am so sorry
for being rude earlier.

18:50.085 --> 18:51.565
- No,
you're a straight shooter,

18:51.608 --> 18:53.610
which is why I'm offering you
the job.

18:53.654 --> 18:56.222
How soon can you relocate
to Lexington?

18:58.572 --> 19:00.400
- Guess we're doing this.

19:00.443 --> 19:01.444
Arthur!

19:01.488 --> 19:04.055
You came!
- Yeah, 154 texts later.

19:04.099 --> 19:05.448
Why are we in a drag club?

19:05.492 --> 19:06.580
- Because it doesn't matter

19:06.623 --> 19:07.755
where our choir gets
to perform,

19:07.798 --> 19:09.322
just that we make music
together.

19:09.365 --> 19:11.019
Also, the lighting
is impeccable.

19:11.062 --> 19:13.587
- You guys go ahead.
You're better off without me.

19:13.630 --> 19:15.893
- Then just stay and listen.

19:15.937 --> 19:17.765
I know you're in pain.

19:17.808 --> 19:19.636
But I also know that music
is your connection

19:19.680 --> 19:22.422
to what I call God.

19:22.465 --> 19:25.207
So shut up and notice the love
all around you!

19:25.251 --> 19:28.079
And if you get a chance,
order the huevos rancheros.
