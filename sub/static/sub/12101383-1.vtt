01:15.110 --> 01:16.283
- Babe, it's fine.

01:17.320 --> 01:18.203
- Not quite.

01:23.090 --> 01:23.923
Better?

01:29.320 --> 01:30.720
- There's something missing.

01:37.120 --> 01:38.870
- You know, we should do something.

01:39.857 --> 01:40.837
- Like what?

01:40.837 --> 01:43.070
- Do you fancy a meal?

01:43.070 --> 01:44.170
- A meal?

01:44.170 --> 01:45.583
Sure, what should I make?

01:47.010 --> 01:47.850
It was a joke.

01:47.850 --> 01:48.893
- Yeah, I bet.

01:49.990 --> 01:51.940
How about that new restaurant tomorrow?

01:54.520 --> 01:56.020
- Tomorrow I'm not sure I can.

01:57.070 --> 01:59.660
I've got a meeting with
Tim at the new site.

01:59.660 --> 02:01.190
It's quite a way.

02:01.190 --> 02:02.860
- Oh, come on, babe.

02:02.860 --> 02:03.920
Spend a bit of time with me.

02:03.920 --> 02:05.220
It's Christmas, fuck work.

02:06.100 --> 02:06.950
- It's important.

02:08.290 --> 02:10.883
If it all goes to plan,
it's a hell of a pay rise.

02:12.010 --> 02:13.892
- Well, I could come with you then.

02:13.892 --> 02:14.792
We could do lunch.

02:16.680 --> 02:17.960
- Honey.

02:17.960 --> 02:19.410
That's impossible, I'm sorry.

02:21.330 --> 02:22.163
- Yeah, I know.

02:23.280 --> 02:24.930
Stupid idea.

02:24.930 --> 02:28.813
- Look, I'll try and
come home early, okay?

02:31.520 --> 02:33.080
A date, huh?

02:33.080 --> 02:34.913
Is that what you want?

02:49.931 --> 02:51.659
- Say I love you.

02:51.659 --> 02:53.491
- I love you.

02:53.491 --> 02:55.321
- Keep saying it.
- I love you.

02:55.321 --> 02:57.488
- Don't stop.
- I love you.

02:58.481 --> 03:01.320
I love you.
- Love you too.

03:04.601 --> 03:05.684
- I love you.

03:06.785 --> 03:07.702
I love you.

03:08.979 --> 03:09.896
I love you.

03:11.390 --> 03:12.307
I love you.

03:46.210 --> 03:48.403
- Hey, let me do that.

03:48.403 --> 03:49.320
- All done.

03:56.370 --> 03:58.993
- Ah, I really hope
Chloe is gonna be okay.

04:00.110 --> 04:02.100
- She'll be fine, honey.

04:02.100 --> 04:03.593
Mom and dad will spoil her.

04:06.650 --> 04:08.550
There was a dead fly in my face cream.

04:09.640 --> 04:10.473
- Okay.

04:13.410 --> 04:16.140
- It's not breaking news, Susan, just odd.

04:16.140 --> 04:17.792
Are there flies in winter?

04:18.770 --> 04:19.603
- What?

04:20.803 --> 04:22.003
You'll be late for work.

04:47.910 --> 04:49.320
- Welcome to Walk of Art.

04:49.320 --> 04:52.110
If you need any help, please let me know.

04:52.110 --> 04:52.943
- Thank you.

05:08.480 --> 05:10.403
Excuse me.
- Sir?

05:11.500 --> 05:12.533
- I want this.

05:14.471 --> 05:16.810
- A wise choice for a lucky lady.

05:16.810 --> 05:18.970
It's my favorite color.

05:18.970 --> 05:19.803
- Mine too.

05:21.030 --> 05:24.170
Reminds me of something my
grandmother used to say.

05:24.170 --> 05:25.003
What was it?

05:26.487 --> 05:29.890
"Love is ever green and never jealous."

05:29.890 --> 05:33.280
- Did you know green is the
color of both love and envy?

05:33.280 --> 05:34.360
No.

05:34.360 --> 05:36.410
- It's an amusing contradiction.

05:55.052 --> 05:55.885
Sir.

05:57.650 --> 05:58.483
- Thank you.

06:00.440 --> 06:01.543
- Merry Christmas.

06:09.890 --> 06:11.123
- 20% more.

06:12.170 --> 06:13.090
Forget it.

06:13.090 --> 06:14.253
We cannot afford to lose him.

06:14.253 --> 06:15.593
He's a prime investor.

06:16.670 --> 06:19.280
- Fuck him and his investment.

06:19.280 --> 06:20.550
You tell him from me,

06:20.550 --> 06:22.300
if he doesn't want to work with us,

06:22.300 --> 06:24.343
step aside, others will.

06:25.990 --> 06:28.772
It's his loss, Tim, not ours.

06:28.772 --> 06:30.660
Jesus, are you sure about this?

06:30.660 --> 06:32.260
- Of course I'm sure.

06:32.260 --> 06:34.520
Nobody plays me for a fool.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.620
Okay, fine, but
he will not be happy.

06:36.620 --> 06:37.860
- Yeah, yeah.

06:37.860 --> 06:38.693
Fuck him.

06:39.679 --> 06:44.679
Whatever.

07:00.060 --> 07:01.100
- Good afternoon, sir.

07:01.100 --> 07:03.760
And welcome to the Orpheus Motel.

07:03.760 --> 07:07.320
I'm Nina, how may I be of service?

07:07.320 --> 07:08.470
- Very professional.

07:08.470 --> 07:10.160
- New year, new management.

07:10.160 --> 07:11.690
It's all changed.

07:11.690 --> 07:14.030
Thought I'd get some practice in.

07:14.030 --> 07:17.530
What do you think?

07:17.530 --> 07:19.513
- Well, you look great.

07:22.170 --> 07:24.360
Hey, where's Steve?

07:24.360 --> 07:26.170
- Oh.
- I thought he was in today.

07:26.170 --> 07:28.630
- He's sick, everyone is.

07:28.630 --> 07:29.830
It's the flu.

07:29.830 --> 07:31.600
Well, man flu.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.958
- Well, I never get sick.

07:33.958 --> 07:34.791
Healthy living.

07:39.060 --> 07:41.046
Here, Merry Christmas.

07:41.046 --> 07:42.453
- Oh, thanks.

07:44.210 --> 07:45.860
It's quiet.

07:45.860 --> 07:48.180
- Yeah, for now, we're fully booked.

07:48.180 --> 07:50.690
Got a big conference,
but nobody's here yet.

07:50.690 --> 07:52.020
- Well, it's party season,

07:52.020 --> 07:54.840
so they're probably in town getting drunk.

07:54.840 --> 07:56.360
- I may join them.

07:56.360 --> 07:58.210
It's better than being stuck here.

07:58.210 --> 07:59.540
- Sounds like a plan.

07:59.540 --> 08:04.540
Hey, if my client doesn't
show, why don't we do that?

08:06.120 --> 08:07.100
- Do what?

08:07.100 --> 08:08.500
Go for a drink?

08:09.480 --> 08:13.770
- Oh, thanks for the offer, but-

08:15.030 --> 08:15.863
- What?

08:17.350 --> 08:18.780
- You're not my type.

08:18.780 --> 08:19.613
Sorry.

08:22.400 --> 08:23.643
- What type am I then?

08:24.690 --> 08:28.903
- The older married type.

08:31.190 --> 08:33.110
- I meant as a friend, Nina.

08:33.110 --> 08:34.093
You misunderstood.

08:35.857 --> 08:37.457
Aren't you forgetting something?

08:38.740 --> 08:40.573
- Key!
- It would help.

08:43.890 --> 08:44.733
- Room seven.

08:47.870 --> 08:49.100
Your key, sir.

08:49.100 --> 08:51.320
And enjoy your stay.

08:51.320 --> 08:52.270
- Cute.

08:52.270 --> 08:53.600
Don't forget my wake-up call.

08:53.600 --> 08:54.650
- The same as usual?

08:54.650 --> 08:56.470
7:00 on the dot.

08:56.470 --> 08:57.769
- Done.

09:57.520 --> 09:58.810
Room service.

09:58.810 --> 10:03.060
- Yes, I'd like champagne
on ice with two glasses,

10:03.060 --> 10:05.920
delivered to room seven
at nine o'clock sharp.

10:05.920 --> 10:07.100
Of course, sir.

10:07.100 --> 10:07.933
- Thanks.

10:34.570 --> 10:35.770
You gotta be kidding me.

10:41.350 --> 10:42.953
And fuck you, too.

10:49.680 --> 10:50.513
Bitch.

11:05.890 --> 11:07.340
- Enjoy your stay.
- Thanks.

11:10.780 --> 11:12.170
- Nina?

11:12.170 --> 11:13.023
Batteries.

11:13.920 --> 11:14.970
- Don't worry, I'll fix it.

11:14.970 --> 11:16.510
No rush.

11:16.510 --> 11:17.343
- Hey, Philippe.

11:18.180 --> 11:20.133
Healthy living.
- Yeah, yeah.

11:32.790 --> 11:34.283
Sorry, have you got a light?

11:36.550 --> 11:37.622
Thanks.
- No problem.

11:42.670 --> 11:45.270
- I'm Paul.
- Philippe.

11:45.270 --> 11:46.220
- Nice to meet you.

11:52.530 --> 11:53.363
Amazing view.

11:55.750 --> 11:56.623
- I guess.

11:59.200 --> 12:00.773
- Really, I think it's beautiful.

12:03.290 --> 12:05.490
You know they run
meditation workshops here.

12:06.660 --> 12:09.960
Trying to convince work to
let me bring the students up.

12:09.960 --> 12:12.313
Increasing concentration
by relieving stress.

12:15.050 --> 12:16.000
- You're a teacher?

12:18.160 --> 12:19.620
- Lecturer, but yeah.

12:21.790 --> 12:24.290
Comparative religious studies.

12:25.450 --> 12:28.730
Yeah, I know it sounds boring.

12:28.730 --> 12:32.163
Maybe it is, but anyway.

12:33.600 --> 12:36.163
Here for a conference,
but no one's turned up.

12:38.360 --> 12:41.107
Missed connection or
delay, something like that.

12:44.140 --> 12:44.973
What about you?

12:44.973 --> 12:45.930
What are you here for?

12:48.260 --> 12:50.723
- As it turns out, I'm
in the same boat as you.

12:52.410 --> 12:54.490
- Yeah, what do you mean?

12:54.490 --> 12:56.040
- Was supposed to meet someone.

12:57.640 --> 12:58.473
Doesn't matter.

12:59.630 --> 13:01.330
- No, no, I'll listen if you want.

13:03.400 --> 13:04.493
- It's a long story.

13:06.851 --> 13:08.530
I'll go grab some food.

13:08.530 --> 13:09.363
Catch you later.

13:18.210 --> 13:19.043
- Hello?

13:26.200 --> 13:27.733
- Thanks.
- No problem.

13:29.140 --> 13:30.280
Look after your room key.

13:30.280 --> 13:32.558
I can't find the spare.

13:32.558 --> 13:36.880
- Shame, I was hoping you'd
sneak in and fuck my brains out.

13:36.880 --> 13:38.540
- I apologize, okay?

13:38.540 --> 13:40.197
Get that crap all the time.

13:40.197 --> 13:42.253
It's hard to know if
someone's being sincere.

13:43.320 --> 13:44.153
- Forget it.

13:57.130 --> 13:57.963
- Good evening, sir.

13:57.963 --> 13:59.030
Ready to order?

13:59.030 --> 14:04.030
- Yes, I'd like the soupe aux champignons,

14:04.280 --> 14:07.110
followed by filet mignon, rare.

14:07.110 --> 14:09.397
- And to drink?
- Merlot.

14:09.397 --> 14:11.340
- Large or small?
- The bottle.

14:11.340 --> 14:12.190
- Very good, sir.

14:29.267 --> 14:30.510
- Hi, daddy.

14:30.510 --> 14:33.145
I miss you, I'm really
excited for Christmas.

14:36.075 --> 14:37.075
- Thank you.

14:54.355 --> 14:55.188
- Evening.

14:57.800 --> 15:01.220
Well, I was going to ask you
if you wanted a drink, but-

15:01.220 --> 15:02.193
- Help yourself.

15:03.983 --> 15:04.983
- Thank you.

15:11.210 --> 15:13.663
I was thinking of heading
into town in a bit.

15:14.605 --> 15:16.155
A few drinks, find some action.

15:17.440 --> 15:21.040
Wanna come?

15:21.040 --> 15:22.280
Come on.

15:22.280 --> 15:23.563
While the cat's away.

15:25.560 --> 15:27.610
While the cat's away, the mice will play.

15:28.470 --> 15:29.670
You don't know that one?

15:31.330 --> 15:32.433
- Mice don't play.

15:33.660 --> 15:36.490
They get stupid and caught in traps.

15:36.490 --> 15:37.323
Snap, snap.

15:40.250 --> 15:42.203
- Oh, not all mice are stupid.

15:43.210 --> 15:45.050
I once knew a mouse that was so clever

15:45.050 --> 15:48.457
it could steal bait from a
trap without getting caught.

15:48.457 --> 15:49.957
Until it got caught of course.

15:51.190 --> 15:52.840
- You knew this mouse personally?

15:54.270 --> 15:55.533
Was he a close friend?

15:59.060 --> 16:00.873
- I knew of a mouse, it's better.

16:02.230 --> 16:04.130
And he was a she.

16:04.130 --> 16:07.610
- Hm, one of the crafty ones.

16:10.646 --> 16:12.140
To clever mice.

16:12.140 --> 16:16.293
- Long may their tails twitch.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.973
So, the girl at reception.

16:23.090 --> 16:25.830
- Nina, she's okay.

16:25.830 --> 16:27.183
Why, you interested?

16:28.960 --> 16:31.755
- Oh, she's nice.

16:31.755 --> 16:33.723
- Nice means you wanna fuck her.

16:35.664 --> 16:37.464
- Wouldn't you, given half a chance?

16:43.700 --> 16:44.980
Ah, you're bullshitting me.

16:44.980 --> 16:45.813
- Nah.

16:47.660 --> 16:49.310
I'm not her type.

16:49.310 --> 16:50.563
Too old apparently.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.143
The downside of hitting 30.

16:54.290 --> 16:56.563
The feast slowly becomes a famine.

16:59.222 --> 17:00.840
Tell you something though,

17:00.840 --> 17:03.810
chick before Nina, what was her name?

17:03.810 --> 17:05.760
Shit, it doesn't matter.

17:05.760 --> 17:09.880
She had the biggest pair
of tits I'd ever seen.

17:09.880 --> 17:11.803
Just beautiful.
- Whoa!

17:13.382 --> 17:15.890
- I wanted to fuck her so much.

17:15.890 --> 17:18.240
- Did ya?
- We hooked up on night,

17:18.240 --> 17:19.173
but that's all.

17:21.200 --> 17:22.350
- While the cat's away.

17:24.380 --> 17:25.213
- Sorry.

17:26.470 --> 17:27.610
I'm on the wine, I talk shit.

17:27.610 --> 17:29.270
- Do you want to get a coffee?

17:29.270 --> 17:30.923
- Nah, I gotta piss.

17:34.520 --> 17:35.663
Back in a minute.

17:50.455 --> 17:52.205
It's just one person.

17:55.895 --> 17:56.895
One opinion.

18:05.710 --> 18:06.543
Fuck it.

18:11.610 --> 18:12.443
- I know.

18:14.320 --> 18:15.527
Oh, yeah, it's okay.

18:15.527 --> 18:17.960
He's here now, one sec.

18:17.960 --> 18:18.793
It's your wife.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.143
- Honey, it's me.

18:24.143 --> 18:25.043
Are you okay?

18:26.990 --> 18:27.823
The meeting's over.

18:27.823 --> 18:29.400
We had a few drinks to celebrate.

18:30.630 --> 18:33.853
No I had a drink, I won't drive home.

18:35.100 --> 18:36.250
Better safe than sorry.

18:40.250 --> 18:41.793
Honey, I've gotta go.

18:43.600 --> 18:44.623
I'll see you tomorrow.

18:46.160 --> 18:49.340
Yeah, I love you, too.

18:49.340 --> 18:50.173
Bye.

18:52.930 --> 18:54.003
Why answer my phone?

18:56.520 --> 18:57.360
- I am so sorry.

18:57.360 --> 19:01.000
I, I thought it might be important.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.323
- I don't need a fucking secretary.

19:23.160 --> 19:24.546
Who is it?

19:24.546 --> 19:25.513
Good evening, sir.

19:25.513 --> 19:29.957
You ordered champagne.

19:29.957 --> 19:31.660
- You're early.

19:31.660 --> 19:32.983
I said 9:00.

20:49.950 --> 20:50.833
- Surprise.

22:27.390 --> 22:28.223
Miss me?

22:30.480 --> 22:32.633
- Every time you leave, I'm jealous.

22:33.780 --> 22:34.613
- Don't be.

22:35.800 --> 22:37.053
I don't fuck him anymore.

22:38.580 --> 22:39.973
I'm all yours.

22:45.120 --> 22:46.643
I think I'm falling for you.

22:49.710 --> 22:50.573
- You can't.

22:52.710 --> 22:54.400
I'm not leaving my husband.

22:54.400 --> 22:56.550
You're not leaving your family.

22:56.550 --> 22:57.623
We agreed, right?

22:58.540 --> 22:59.763
You promised.

23:00.820 --> 23:02.873
- I don't always keep my promises.

23:03.970 --> 23:05.353
- You're a naughty man.

23:08.647 --> 23:10.833
But let's keep it light between us, okay?

23:11.860 --> 23:13.313
Just enjoy ourselves.

23:14.360 --> 23:15.343
Have some fun.

23:17.720 --> 23:18.553
- Why?

23:19.710 --> 23:21.093
I know you feel the same.

23:21.950 --> 23:23.650
Besides I need you.

23:23.650 --> 23:26.823
- No, you just wanna fuck me.

23:28.330 --> 23:31.270
- Can't you see that
it's more than just that?

23:31.270 --> 23:32.103
It's perfect.

23:34.070 --> 23:35.720
- Let's go out.

23:35.720 --> 23:38.440
Find a bar, get drunk.

23:38.440 --> 23:40.690
I think I need to catch up.

23:40.690 --> 23:42.090
- Why not call room service?

23:42.990 --> 23:44.900
- It's not the same.

23:44.900 --> 23:46.430
I wanna dance.

23:46.430 --> 23:47.980
I wanna have some fun with you.

23:50.600 --> 23:51.743
You think too much.

23:53.266 --> 23:55.060
Let some chaos in.

23:55.060 --> 23:57.813
- I can't dance and I hate chaos.

23:58.750 --> 24:00.363
- You'll be too drunk to care.

24:01.230 --> 24:02.063
Trust me.

24:07.930 --> 24:08.920
- Hey, Nina.

24:08.920 --> 24:10.730
You driving to town?

24:10.730 --> 24:12.050
- I have a taxi outside.

24:12.050 --> 24:12.960
- Can we share it?

24:12.960 --> 24:14.500
I'll pay.

24:14.500 --> 24:15.597
- If you insist.

24:27.407 --> 24:29.847
What do
you like best about me?

24:29.847 --> 24:30.847
- About you?

24:32.580 --> 24:35.593
I like your smile, your sense of humor,

24:38.190 --> 24:39.603
the way you make me feel.

24:41.196 --> 24:42.029
And...

24:44.215 --> 24:45.048
- What?

24:46.810 --> 24:47.743
- I feel safe.

24:49.660 --> 24:50.493
What about you?

24:53.715 --> 24:55.403
- It's the way you look at me.

24:57.860 --> 25:02.163
I look into those eyes and
everything else just fades away.

25:04.480 --> 25:05.313
Feels like home.

25:09.380 --> 25:10.613
Do you believe in fate?

25:12.410 --> 25:14.210
- I don't know.

25:14.210 --> 25:15.043
Like what?

25:16.930 --> 25:21.150
- Do you believe people meet
and things happen for a reason?

25:21.150 --> 25:23.510
- You mean like a plan?

25:23.510 --> 25:24.410
Yeah.

25:25.910 --> 25:29.283
I believe in luck, not fate.

25:30.270 --> 25:33.283
So, you don't think
we're fated to be together?

25:34.530 --> 25:36.420
- Maybe we were just lucky

25:36.420 --> 25:37.823
to have found one another.

25:41.156 --> 25:41.989
Dance with me.

25:48.470 --> 25:49.993
See, you're not so bad.

25:52.540 --> 25:53.373
- I love you.

26:13.126 --> 26:14.380
Room service.

26:14.380 --> 26:17.180
- Another bottle of
champagne for room seven.

26:17.180 --> 26:18.210
Very good, sir.

26:18.210 --> 26:19.043
- Thanks.

26:45.070 --> 26:46.163
For you, beautiful.

26:50.600 --> 26:52.433
- That's sweet.
- Merry Christmas.

26:54.250 --> 26:55.330
- You know I can't.

26:56.840 --> 26:57.693
- Just once.

26:58.870 --> 26:59.720
He'll never know.

27:09.735 --> 27:11.803
- It's beautiful.

27:21.820 --> 27:23.180
Who is it?

27:23.180 --> 27:24.013
- Room service.

27:27.490 --> 27:28.323
That was quick.

27:45.843 --> 27:47.343
- You can do this.

28:02.840 --> 28:03.913
Good morning, class.

28:04.960 --> 28:06.210
First day of school.

28:06.210 --> 28:07.093
First lesson.

28:09.783 --> 28:12.770
Oh, the tape stays on for now.

28:15.070 --> 28:19.263
So, who knows anything
about the golden rule?

28:21.350 --> 28:22.183
Anybody?

28:23.710 --> 28:24.543
Philippe?

28:26.910 --> 28:27.800
No?

28:27.800 --> 28:32.750
Okay, well, the golden rule
is a very old philosophy,

28:32.750 --> 28:34.610
it dates back to Ancient Egypt.

28:34.610 --> 28:39.610
From there, it spread through
the Middle East and to China,

28:39.870 --> 28:41.633
and then to Europe.

28:42.840 --> 28:47.840
Its roots are embedded
in every major religion

28:48.380 --> 28:53.380
and it is the moral cornerstone
of civilized society.

28:56.440 --> 29:01.440
It is a very simple, but
profound master stroke

29:04.240 --> 29:06.033
of reciprocal altruism.

29:07.070 --> 29:08.147
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

29:08.147 --> 29:10.133
Are the big words going over your head?

29:12.730 --> 29:13.830
I'll put it like this.

29:17.520 --> 29:22.193
What is hateful to you, do
not do onto your fellow man.

29:28.020 --> 29:30.800
Well, I'm gonna take
an educated guess that

29:30.800 --> 29:33.003
that young lady wasn't your wife.

29:40.740 --> 29:41.573
I thought so.

29:42.930 --> 29:43.763
You see that?

29:43.763 --> 29:47.889
That is an excellent example
of breaking the golden rule.

29:47.889 --> 29:50.735
Put yourself in my shoes.

29:50.735 --> 29:54.005
Imagine you're not married.

29:54.005 --> 29:56.994
It appears you wouldn't like it.

29:56.994 --> 29:58.685
It's very painful.

30:08.480 --> 30:09.880
Guess what I found in there?

30:13.150 --> 30:14.143
Your manners.

30:18.470 --> 30:21.380
You were very rude to
me in the restaurant.

30:21.380 --> 30:23.760
I was trying to do you a
favor answering your phone.

30:23.760 --> 30:27.130
Your wife, she was in a blind panic.

30:27.130 --> 30:29.793
She'd called earlier, but no reply.

30:32.570 --> 30:33.670
Why would you do that?

30:35.380 --> 30:37.360
I mean, even if playing
away you could have at least

30:37.360 --> 30:39.230
let her know you were safe.

30:39.230 --> 30:40.910
And there I was trying to help.

30:40.910 --> 30:42.870
And all I get is abuse.

30:42.870 --> 30:44.200
You know, I could've,

30:44.200 --> 30:46.523
I could've told her
about the receptionist.

30:49.430 --> 30:51.290
- Who the fuck are you?

30:51.290 --> 30:52.283
Where's Camille?

31:00.640 --> 31:01.590
What are you doing?

31:06.315 --> 31:08.847
It's not here.

31:08.847 --> 31:11.370
- What the fuck are you talking about?

31:11.370 --> 31:12.360
- Your manners.

31:14.614 --> 31:15.447
Hm.

31:17.797 --> 31:20.297
You know what else isn't here?

31:23.320 --> 31:24.443
There's no wrappers.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.944
Do you always fuck my
wife without a condom?

31:47.493 --> 31:49.493
No, no, no!

31:51.180 --> 31:52.680
- You see, I heard every word.

31:55.180 --> 31:56.217
Connects to an app.

31:57.240 --> 31:58.423
Recorded it, too.

32:08.620 --> 32:09.765
What do you think she'd say?

32:15.297 --> 32:18.983
All those messages, photos.

32:25.770 --> 32:29.173
Okay, so in a minute, I'm
gonna take off the tape.

32:31.340 --> 32:32.490
We need to have a chat.

32:35.170 --> 32:36.620
If you make a noise...

32:39.200 --> 32:41.760
Well, that's fine.

32:41.760 --> 32:43.660
'Cause there's no one around, you see?

32:44.840 --> 32:46.023
No conference.

32:47.900 --> 32:49.640
All the rooms are booked for reasons

32:49.640 --> 32:51.357
too numerous to enumerate.

33:39.320 --> 33:43.503
That's Bacchus or
Dionysus if you're Greek.

33:46.360 --> 33:50.843
God of wine, sex, madness.

33:55.350 --> 33:58.123
Torn apart by the wrath
of a jealous spouse,

34:00.720 --> 34:01.963
and later resurrected.

34:03.370 --> 34:07.570
A symbol of death and rebirth
and a pruning of the vines

34:07.570 --> 34:09.433
to encourage fresh growth.

34:12.280 --> 34:16.513
Grapes for the harvest of new wine.

34:22.980 --> 34:25.830
You know, that's the exact
same look my students give me.

34:26.920 --> 34:30.613
All they care about is console games,

34:31.980 --> 34:35.647
getting drunk, who fancies who.

34:39.424 --> 34:42.117
You know, to them, ethics are a meme.

34:48.800 --> 34:52.233
It's a generation of
hashtag retweet morals,

34:53.970 --> 34:55.623
and celebrity is God.

35:03.360 --> 35:06.973
You know, I once knew a guy so vain,

35:09.110 --> 35:12.980
he said he believed in the almighty 100%

35:12.980 --> 35:16.850
because he saw his face every morning

35:16.850 --> 35:18.300
in the mirror when he shaved.

35:25.150 --> 35:26.543
He died in a car crash.

35:28.210 --> 35:30.063
Hit a tree while taking a selfie.

35:42.150 --> 35:43.483
- What do you want?

35:46.320 --> 35:47.570
- That's a good question.

35:51.370 --> 35:53.020
- I don't want any trouble, okay?

35:56.090 --> 35:57.360
- When you fuck another man's wife,

35:57.360 --> 35:58.993
trouble's normally close behind.

36:01.250 --> 36:02.630
- I'm sorry.

36:02.630 --> 36:04.130
- Well, that's fine then, huh?

36:05.373 --> 36:07.020
Off you go, no harm done.

36:07.020 --> 36:08.270
- I'll do anything you want.

36:09.360 --> 36:10.930
Anything!

36:10.930 --> 36:15.420
Just don't tell my wife, please.

36:15.420 --> 36:17.583
- Jesus Christ, well that
didn't take long, did it?

36:22.241 --> 36:23.760
Oh, don't worry, Philippe.

36:23.760 --> 36:25.210
I'm not gonna tell your wife.

36:26.700 --> 36:27.533
- Thank you.

36:29.430 --> 36:34.430
- No, you will on this.

36:37.080 --> 36:42.080
A full confession, then
it goes on your Facebook,

36:43.200 --> 36:48.200
Instagram, Snapchat, all the
other shit you've got on here.

36:50.133 --> 36:51.430
You know, really, this could be the phone

36:51.430 --> 36:53.220
of a 12 year old girl.

36:53.220 --> 36:54.700
Just saying it could be.

36:54.700 --> 36:56.300
- That's not gonna happen, okay?

36:58.070 --> 36:59.023
I have money.

37:00.910 --> 37:02.563
I can pay you whatever you want.

37:04.260 --> 37:05.563
Let's make a deal, okay?

37:06.610 --> 37:07.690
- You mean like do business?

37:07.690 --> 37:08.523
- Yes.

37:11.840 --> 37:13.040
- I've got another idea.

37:16.094 --> 37:19.357
Either you confess or I make you confess-

37:21.503 --> 37:24.440
- 1,000 every month for life.

37:24.440 --> 37:27.820
- No, you're not listening to me.

37:27.820 --> 37:29.950
- 2,000 tax free, come on.

37:29.950 --> 37:34.000
- I would not wipe my ass
with your money, okay?

37:34.000 --> 37:35.113
I want a confession.

37:36.700 --> 37:37.533
- No.

37:39.270 --> 37:40.103
- Philippe.

37:41.130 --> 37:41.963
- Fuck you.

37:47.426 --> 37:50.300
Jesus, man, no, I'm sorry.

37:50.300 --> 37:51.740
I'm sorry, I won't touch her again.

37:51.740 --> 37:52.573
I promise.

37:52.573 --> 37:54.980
- You're just saying what
you think I wanna hear.

37:56.920 --> 37:58.433
It's a survival instinct.

37:59.950 --> 38:00.800
It's not sincere.

38:06.850 --> 38:08.263
You have to be sincere.

38:10.814 --> 38:12.414
And you have to make me believe.

38:20.450 --> 38:24.313
- On my daughter's life, I'm sorry.

38:26.640 --> 38:28.600
You gotta believe me.

38:28.600 --> 38:33.173
I know I've screwed up, but think of her.

38:34.430 --> 38:37.023
You'll destroy everything she loves.

38:37.980 --> 38:39.333
Her family.
- And my family.

38:43.702 --> 38:45.452
Not a second thought?

38:47.070 --> 38:48.003
- Just let me go.

38:50.044 --> 38:51.470
And we'll say no more about it.

38:51.470 --> 38:52.811
- Well, what is that, is that a threat?

38:52.811 --> 38:54.893
- No, no, no, no, it's not a threat.

38:57.312 --> 38:58.393
It's a assurance.

39:00.010 --> 39:02.383
No police, no trouble.

39:04.160 --> 39:06.373
Just two guys coming to an arrangement.

39:08.260 --> 39:09.093
Come on.

39:10.236 --> 39:11.069
What do you say?

39:13.660 --> 39:15.330
It's Christmas.

39:15.330 --> 39:16.870
- Fuck Christmas.

39:16.870 --> 39:17.780
Fuck Christmas.

39:17.780 --> 39:18.613
Fuck you, too.

39:18.613 --> 39:20.490
Is that all Chloe is to you?

39:20.490 --> 39:23.950
Just a shield against consequences.

39:23.950 --> 39:27.130
- You said Chloe.

39:27.130 --> 39:28.443
I never told you her name.

39:31.030 --> 39:32.463
How do you know her name?

39:34.010 --> 39:35.613
- That's a very good question.

39:37.110 --> 39:38.700
That's two in five minutes.

39:38.700 --> 39:40.470
Fuck, you must be getting dizzy.

39:40.470 --> 39:42.620
- How do you know my daughter's name?

39:42.620 --> 39:43.713
Tell me.
- No!

39:45.450 --> 39:47.970
Philippe, education has a structure.

39:47.970 --> 39:50.843
- If you've hurt my
daughter, I will kill you.

39:52.090 --> 39:53.223
- Tell me what I want.

39:55.020 --> 39:58.483
Then, I'll answer question number two.

39:59.960 --> 40:00.873
- Revenge.

40:02.020 --> 40:03.120
Not my style.

40:04.740 --> 40:06.770
- You want a confession.

40:06.770 --> 40:07.603
Why?

40:09.611 --> 40:11.063
- You want me to suffer.

40:12.832 --> 40:13.932
- You must try harder.

40:15.290 --> 40:18.863
- You want to post the confession online,

40:21.080 --> 40:22.153
and embarrass me.

40:24.920 --> 40:25.913
Humiliate me.

40:26.780 --> 40:30.913
- Please, don't think
of it as humiliation.

40:33.810 --> 40:35.263
Think of it as an education.

40:36.300 --> 40:38.123
- My daughter, you promised.

40:40.640 --> 40:41.593
- I know Chloe.

40:53.120 --> 40:55.273
Hold that thought.
- Paul, Paul, Paul!

41:31.390 --> 41:32.493
Is Chloe all right?

41:33.430 --> 41:35.160
- Shut up.
- Just tell me.

41:36.770 --> 41:39.960
- As if you'll confess
if I tell you she's fine.

41:39.960 --> 41:41.400
- I will.

41:41.400 --> 41:42.393
I promise.

41:43.713 --> 41:45.613
- And what do you know about promises?

41:57.190 --> 41:58.023
Last chance.

42:06.780 --> 42:11.073
Confess or I send everything
on the phone to your wife.

42:15.670 --> 42:19.143
- You get nothing until
I know Chloe's safe.

42:25.420 --> 42:27.100
- I've already got everything.

42:28.440 --> 42:29.683
I win either way.

42:30.690 --> 42:32.960
Just thought I'd give you a chance.

42:32.960 --> 42:37.760
- A chance for what?

42:37.760 --> 42:38.593
- Absolution.

42:40.530 --> 42:42.143
Confession's good for the soul.

42:44.300 --> 42:45.133
If you have one.

42:54.750 --> 42:55.583
Hm.

42:59.470 --> 43:03.363
- Paul, please, we can sort it out.

43:04.310 --> 43:05.313
- Can we sort this?

43:09.290 --> 43:10.123
- Don't do it.

43:13.200 --> 43:14.883
She'll leave and take Chloe.

43:18.600 --> 43:19.433
- Sent.

43:22.470 --> 43:25.013
Bye bye, Chloe.
- Jesus Christ.

43:30.733 --> 43:31.566
I'm sorry.

43:33.060 --> 43:34.353
- Don't feel ashamed.

43:37.970 --> 43:39.343
This means you love.

43:41.694 --> 43:42.777
There's hope.

43:57.643 --> 44:02.143
"Give a strong drink unto
him that is ready to perish,

44:04.462 --> 44:06.967
and wine unto those that
be of heavy hearts."

44:08.820 --> 44:09.653
Proverbs.

44:26.500 --> 44:27.950
So, let's talk about Camille.

44:32.130 --> 44:37.130
Let's talk about what's been
snuffling between her legs.

44:42.090 --> 44:47.090
A bloated bore with an
appetite for apples.

45:05.781 --> 45:08.031
I've been waiting for this.

45:15.610 --> 45:19.063
Funny thing is I was following
you expecting to see Camille.

45:22.350 --> 45:25.170
Stupid mice get caught in traps.

45:25.170 --> 45:26.453
Snap, snap, snap.

45:34.030 --> 45:35.530
And now for the coup de grace.

45:44.220 --> 45:45.963
She'd deny it to your face.

45:48.190 --> 45:49.623
I thought I was losing her.

45:51.930 --> 45:56.930
I could see the struggle,
until I showed her that.

46:00.460 --> 46:05.460
And now she knows the
truth that you are nothing

46:06.940 --> 46:09.953
but a filthy fucking pig.

46:18.420 --> 46:19.593
Class dismissed.

46:35.770 --> 46:37.170
- Oh, I was about to forget.

46:38.010 --> 46:39.430
I stopped by some friends.

46:39.430 --> 46:40.480
I'm heading back now.

46:42.790 --> 46:43.903
Doesn't matter who.

46:46.170 --> 46:47.370
What are you, my mother?

46:49.280 --> 46:51.643
Yeah, it was a joke, mom.

46:53.350 --> 46:56.910
All right, bye.

47:42.092 --> 47:43.009
- Philippe?

48:50.973 --> 48:51.806
- Hm?

48:53.732 --> 48:55.149
You want a drink?

48:56.570 --> 48:57.403
Wait your turn.

49:12.620 --> 49:13.670
- I want a cigarette.

49:17.530 --> 49:19.923
- Manners, remember?

49:21.100 --> 49:23.173
- May I please have a cigarette?

49:44.060 --> 49:44.893
A light?

49:57.190 --> 49:58.023
Sorry.

50:11.249 --> 50:13.120
Mother fucker!
- Oh!

50:13.120 --> 50:14.503
- Is Chloe safe?

50:16.607 --> 50:19.440
Is she safe?
- Yes, yes, yes.

50:19.440 --> 50:20.340
- Where's Camille?

50:21.440 --> 50:24.159
Where's Camille?
- Room 12, room 12.

50:24.159 --> 50:26.143
Oh, fuck.

50:29.159 --> 50:30.576
Ah, ah!
- Come on!

50:43.016 --> 50:44.509
- Camille!

50:57.132 --> 50:58.542
- Susan, don't!

50:58.542 --> 51:00.959
That's enough, that's enough.

51:25.093 --> 51:26.503
- What do you think?

51:28.930 --> 51:32.440
I mean, it's not my usual
color, but then again,

51:32.440 --> 51:35.390
there's nothing really usual
about tonight at all is there?

51:36.550 --> 51:39.133
'Cause tonight I have a date.

51:44.640 --> 51:45.893
It's absurd, isn't it?

51:47.850 --> 51:49.700
I mean, why do we even bother really?

51:51.140 --> 51:53.340
The average man is not gonna
go to this much trouble,

51:53.340 --> 51:54.417
I can assure you.

51:57.290 --> 51:59.290
But then again with a figure like yours,

52:00.720 --> 52:03.120
I guess you don't have
to try very hard, do you?

52:14.007 --> 52:16.757
You know, you and I have more
in common than you think.

52:20.750 --> 52:22.673
I cheated on my ex-husband, too.

52:24.470 --> 52:25.513
Had affairs.

52:27.620 --> 52:28.913
And then, I met Philippe.

52:35.045 --> 52:39.462
You know, we'd actually meet
here at this very motel.

52:41.780 --> 52:43.253
It was our secret place.

52:44.340 --> 52:47.173
Our escape.

52:49.090 --> 52:50.760
Oh, I was such a bitch back then.

52:52.830 --> 52:54.030
Do you know what I mean?

52:58.830 --> 53:02.333
Anyway, I had no regrets.

53:04.450 --> 53:05.283
None.

53:07.020 --> 53:08.630
None whatsoever.

53:08.630 --> 53:09.570
I know it's funny, isn't it?

53:09.570 --> 53:12.233
Because now you've
actually stolen him off me,

53:13.151 --> 53:17.403
but don't worry 'cause I
don't blame you entirely.

53:25.140 --> 53:27.093
You glad you helped me
catch him now, Camille?

53:29.394 --> 53:30.311
Thought so.

54:14.208 --> 54:16.623
Jesus Christ.

54:18.910 --> 54:21.050
Well, you know, if all else fails,

54:21.050 --> 54:23.433
you'll have a shining
career as a gynecologist.

54:27.380 --> 54:29.033
I would say they disgust me,

54:30.910 --> 54:32.860
but in some ways when I think about it,

54:33.970 --> 54:35.613
I feel it's a bit of a turn on.

54:37.930 --> 54:39.380
I mean, what's wrong with me?

54:41.620 --> 54:42.820
I'm beautiful, aren't I?

54:46.234 --> 54:47.484
Of course I am.

54:50.333 --> 54:52.260
Oh, and just for the record.

54:53.131 --> 54:56.027
I heard everything by the way.

54:56.027 --> 54:59.870
All that talk of true
love and feeling safe.

54:59.870 --> 55:04.233
Philippe, you're God's gift to no one.

55:09.900 --> 55:12.763
Dinner time.

55:20.865 --> 55:23.361
And don't you dare blame Paul.

55:23.361 --> 55:26.750
I've known about your
little affair now for weeks,

55:26.750 --> 55:28.860
and there was no business convention.

55:30.210 --> 55:32.703
I charged every suite to your card.

55:33.730 --> 55:36.950
I wanted to make this date extra special.

55:36.950 --> 55:38.920
Nobody here, but us.

55:38.920 --> 55:43.340
And as we both know, close
circuits here are a no-no.

55:43.340 --> 55:45.480
It's a hideaway for cheats.

55:45.480 --> 55:49.937
And when it pays, well, why
put cameras in paradise, eh?

55:50.920 --> 55:53.870
Thank you, maitre d, can you
check on the food now, please?

55:59.080 --> 55:59.913
It's funny, isn't it?

55:59.913 --> 56:01.400
This morning when you left,

56:01.400 --> 56:03.663
I was still that innocent
little housewife.

56:07.070 --> 56:08.233
Mm, delicious.

56:09.420 --> 56:11.320
You know, you really should
try some of this, Philippe.

56:11.320 --> 56:12.720
It really, really is divine.

56:14.040 --> 56:14.873
Oh, yeah.

56:20.380 --> 56:21.213
Let me help you.

56:31.030 --> 56:33.630
You're supposed to swallow, my darling.

56:33.630 --> 56:35.730
I mean, that's what you've always told me.

56:38.340 --> 56:39.800
- Bitch, you won't get away with this.

56:39.800 --> 56:40.633
- Maybe not.

56:40.633 --> 56:44.700
After all, everything
we do has consequences.

56:44.700 --> 56:45.573
Even for you.

56:51.716 --> 56:53.860
- Consequences?

56:53.860 --> 56:54.693
Like what?

56:54.693 --> 56:57.570
- For you, my love, a banquet.

56:57.570 --> 56:58.613
Oh, starters.

56:59.780 --> 57:02.190
And I've put something
a little extra special

57:02.190 --> 57:03.253
in there for you.

57:04.570 --> 57:08.477
Oh, would you like mommy
to feed you instead?

57:11.880 --> 57:13.860
- You can shove that spoon

57:13.860 --> 57:15.620
and your date right up your ass.

57:15.620 --> 57:18.610
- Philippe, what do they
call a dish best served cold?

57:18.610 --> 57:19.453
- Revenge.

57:20.970 --> 57:22.520
Is that what this is all about?

57:24.710 --> 57:27.210
You could have filed for divorce.

57:27.210 --> 57:30.083
Had the car, the house, everything.

57:31.620 --> 57:33.635
Instead you teamed up with this loser.

57:33.635 --> 57:37.573
- Oh, no, this is not
about a straight revenge.

57:38.840 --> 57:41.260
This is about making something perfect.

57:42.890 --> 57:46.060
I mean, that's what you always
like, isn't it, Philippe?

57:46.060 --> 57:48.567
You want everything to be perfect.

57:56.403 --> 57:58.217
Is this perfect enough for you?

58:01.290 --> 58:02.440
It's pretty good to me.

58:21.001 --> 58:22.430
Oh, you're clumsy.

58:22.430 --> 58:23.263
Allow me.

58:24.834 --> 58:27.313
Oh, such a baby.

58:28.380 --> 58:31.610
Now, are we ready for our main course?

58:31.610 --> 58:32.443
Maitre d.

58:41.750 --> 58:42.583
Perfection.

58:45.790 --> 58:49.160
I mean, tell me, is it the constant stream

58:49.160 --> 58:51.883
of altered images into your world?

58:54.170 --> 58:59.010
You know, the body
beautiful, perfect breasts,

58:59.010 --> 59:00.333
unwrinkled brow.

59:06.560 --> 59:08.753
You have no idea what
it's like as a woman.

59:11.510 --> 59:13.680
To be made to feel ashamed and fearful

59:13.680 --> 59:15.693
of growing old on a daily basis.

59:20.920 --> 59:21.817
Now, you look me in the eye

59:21.817 --> 59:23.737
and tell me it's the same for men.

59:27.080 --> 59:28.633
- Maybe it is.
- Bullshit.

59:30.270 --> 59:31.103
- Susan.

59:34.650 --> 59:36.943
Please listen.

59:38.134 --> 59:39.163
We can fix this.

59:42.360 --> 59:44.893
Let's go home, talk, whatever it takes.

59:45.860 --> 59:46.960
Let's save our family.

59:54.130 --> 59:55.130
- Hold that thought.

59:56.070 --> 59:57.243
Main course.

59:58.236 --> 59:59.069
Hm.

1:00:01.510 --> 1:00:04.393
You know, in France, this
is known as a cassoulet.

1:00:06.228 --> 1:00:07.293
I made it myself.

1:00:08.470 --> 1:00:12.730
Takes hours to prepare,
but like most things,

1:00:12.730 --> 1:00:16.202
when you put the time and
effort into it, it's perfect.

1:00:19.320 --> 1:00:21.746
- No.
- Open wide.

1:00:27.300 --> 1:00:29.142
- You don't like it?

1:00:29.142 --> 1:00:31.314
Well, I tried my very best.

1:00:31.314 --> 1:00:33.481
It's time for dessert now.

1:00:40.420 --> 1:00:41.543
Date's nearly over.

1:00:42.580 --> 1:00:44.143
You wanted to have your talk?

1:00:48.330 --> 1:00:51.150
So, what should we talk about then?

1:00:51.150 --> 1:00:54.753
Weather, politics, TV?

1:00:56.230 --> 1:00:59.683
- Chloe.

1:01:05.520 --> 1:01:06.353
- Oh, look.

1:01:08.396 --> 1:01:10.863
It's a tart, your favorite.

1:01:37.870 --> 1:01:40.983
You know, they call this
the drink and forgetfulness.

1:01:44.080 --> 1:01:47.023
One sip and all this
becomes a distant memory.

1:01:49.957 --> 1:01:52.433
Are you ready to forgive
and forget now, Camille?

1:01:54.540 --> 1:01:56.763
We can make this whole thing all go away.

1:02:05.420 --> 1:02:07.530
Tell her what you told
me in the restaurant.

1:02:07.530 --> 1:02:08.363
Go on.

1:02:09.580 --> 1:02:12.673
Tell her how you want us to
start again and remain a family.

1:02:14.660 --> 1:02:19.400
Show her how you begged.

1:02:19.400 --> 1:02:21.253
Not so pretty now, is he?

1:02:22.700 --> 1:02:26.023
- You wanna continue with
this stupid charade, fine.

1:02:27.680 --> 1:02:29.830
Let her drink and then let her go.

1:02:51.600 --> 1:02:55.163
- A toast then, to Absinthe friends.

1:03:01.270 --> 1:03:02.103
- Do it.

1:03:10.694 --> 1:03:12.194
What is the point?

1:03:22.380 --> 1:03:24.880
- Well, it was really
lovely to meet you, Camille.

1:03:26.130 --> 1:03:27.680
We should do it again sometime.

1:03:38.414 --> 1:03:40.933
- Camille, Camille.

1:03:57.320 --> 1:03:58.793
- Oh, and what's so funny?

1:03:59.630 --> 1:04:04.450
- That's it, it's over.

1:04:04.450 --> 1:04:06.560
- Oh God, baby.

1:04:06.560 --> 1:04:11.057
We are so far from over.

1:04:47.221 --> 1:04:52.221
Cheers.

1:05:08.394 --> 1:05:11.051
See what you made me do?

1:05:11.051 --> 1:05:14.218
Drove me into the arms of another man.

1:05:17.760 --> 1:05:19.723
- You're such a fucking hypocrite.

1:05:21.490 --> 1:05:24.700
How does your golden rule
theory sit with fucking my wife?

1:05:24.700 --> 1:05:25.903
- There's a difference.

1:05:26.780 --> 1:05:27.880
Bullshit.

1:05:28.960 --> 1:05:31.583
- You broke a rule, not us.

1:06:08.020 --> 1:06:09.970
You wanna watch while I fuck your wife?

1:06:12.650 --> 1:06:14.494
I could turn you to the wall if you want.

1:06:14.494 --> 1:06:18.970
- No, he can close his eyes if
he doesn't like what he sees.

1:07:25.821 --> 1:07:28.540
- You call that fucking?

1:07:28.540 --> 1:07:30.023
You fuck like an old man.

1:07:31.630 --> 1:07:34.350
Go on then, Paul, fuck her hard.

1:07:34.350 --> 1:07:36.140
Cum on her and rub it all over.

1:07:36.140 --> 1:07:37.243
She loves that.

1:07:38.306 --> 1:07:41.550
You fucking old man.

1:07:41.550 --> 1:07:42.590
Is it even up?

1:07:44.140 --> 1:07:46.590
I'm surprised you're hard after the amount

1:07:46.590 --> 1:07:48.292
of booze you've knocked back.

1:07:48.292 --> 1:07:50.710
Think you can last all night?

1:07:50.710 --> 1:07:55.710
No chance, you weak fuck!

1:07:56.060 --> 1:07:58.718
- Oh!

1:08:03.504 --> 1:08:05.423
- Oh God, he's really good, Philippe.

1:08:06.810 --> 1:08:09.638
But this could get a hell of a lot better.

1:08:09.638 --> 1:08:11.950
Yeah, keep talking dirty to me.

1:08:11.950 --> 1:08:12.783
Go on.

1:08:13.700 --> 1:08:15.910
Make me really, really wet for him.

1:08:15.910 --> 1:08:19.173
- Bitch, you disgust me.

1:08:20.010 --> 1:08:22.020
Your pussy stinks.

1:08:22.020 --> 1:08:23.663
I hated going down on you.

1:08:24.940 --> 1:08:26.933
I can't believe Chloe came from that.

1:08:27.990 --> 1:08:31.373
How can someone so beautiful
come from that sick cunt?

1:08:33.980 --> 1:08:34.813
You whore!

1:08:35.656 --> 1:08:36.656
- You know, Philippe...

1:08:37.490 --> 1:08:39.271
Your wife's a really good fuck.

1:08:41.360 --> 1:08:43.360
Men would die to fuck a woman like this.

1:08:48.060 --> 1:08:49.477
- Say I love you.

1:08:50.485 --> 1:08:51.568
- I love you.

1:08:52.410 --> 1:08:56.480
- Keep saying it.
- I love you, I love you.

1:08:56.480 --> 1:09:00.745
- Don't stop.
- I love you, I love you.

1:09:00.745 --> 1:09:04.194
I love you, oh!

1:09:36.422 --> 1:09:39.670
You know, I think he liked that.

1:09:39.670 --> 1:09:41.163
- He didn't close his eyes.

1:09:44.663 --> 1:09:47.280
Did that make you hard?

1:09:47.280 --> 1:09:49.243
Did Paul fucking me turn you on?

1:09:50.520 --> 1:09:52.887
- Or maybe you just like watching me.

1:09:59.940 --> 1:10:00.773
No, nothing?

1:10:03.020 --> 1:10:04.533
Did you peek at sick cunt?

1:10:07.490 --> 1:10:09.113
Verses to rival Blake.

1:10:12.693 --> 1:10:14.743
- I don't think Philippe likes poetry.

1:10:20.017 --> 1:10:25.017
- "Cruelty has a human heart
and jealousy a human face.

1:10:28.570 --> 1:10:31.393
Terror, the human form divine.

1:10:33.807 --> 1:10:36.163
And Secrecy, the human dress.

1:10:38.760 --> 1:10:41.053
The human dress, is forged iron.

1:10:42.510 --> 1:10:44.773
The human form, a fiery forge.

1:10:47.750 --> 1:10:51.233
The human face, a furnace sealed.

1:10:54.040 --> 1:10:57.557
The human heart, its hungry gorge."

1:11:11.967 --> 1:11:14.105
- "For mercy has a human heart.

1:11:18.330 --> 1:11:20.623
Pity, a human face.

1:11:24.860 --> 1:11:27.713
Love, the human form divine.

1:11:31.040 --> 1:11:34.837
And peace, the human dress."

1:11:39.087 --> 1:11:39.920
Chloe.

1:12:13.380 --> 1:12:14.580
- Share and share alike.

1:13:03.750 --> 1:13:06.623
Still here?
- Yes.

1:13:09.220 --> 1:13:10.053
- Why?

1:13:12.860 --> 1:13:13.823
- Enjoy yourself?

1:13:19.270 --> 1:13:21.353
- Yeah, well, now you
know what it feels like.

1:13:28.150 --> 1:13:29.350
- Do you feel the guilt?

1:13:31.090 --> 1:13:32.343
I always felt guilty.

1:13:37.221 --> 1:13:39.471
- I don't know what I feel.

1:13:42.807 --> 1:13:45.353
I just wanted to hurt him and you.

1:13:51.410 --> 1:13:52.593
- Mission accomplished.

1:13:56.550 --> 1:13:57.383
Feel better?

1:13:58.451 --> 1:14:01.583
- A little, yeah.

1:14:04.400 --> 1:14:05.303
I hate myself.

1:14:11.360 --> 1:14:12.863
But I hate him a little less.

1:14:17.327 --> 1:14:19.833
It's like a stone's been
lifted off my heart.

1:14:31.850 --> 1:14:32.683
- Let's go home.

1:14:35.391 --> 1:14:36.724
- And then what?

1:14:39.507 --> 1:14:41.590
I don't know.

1:15:00.947 --> 1:15:02.773
- You're gonna have to let me go soon.

1:15:04.200 --> 1:15:06.400
The cleaners start doing
the rounds at 7:00.

1:15:11.140 --> 1:15:12.480
Come on.

1:15:12.480 --> 1:15:14.310
We're done playing games.

1:15:14.310 --> 1:15:15.203
Untie me.

1:15:16.050 --> 1:15:17.956
- You never complained about it before.

1:15:17.956 --> 1:15:19.720
- God damn it, Susan.

1:15:19.720 --> 1:15:20.613
Let me go.

1:15:28.216 --> 1:15:30.320
- You know, babe, I doubt she'd

1:15:30.320 --> 1:15:34.390
had gone to all this trouble for you.

1:15:34.390 --> 1:15:35.775
- What do you mean?

1:15:35.775 --> 1:15:36.608
- Camille.

1:15:38.700 --> 1:15:40.103
She was so quick to leave.

1:15:43.520 --> 1:15:44.353
Wasn't she?

1:15:46.650 --> 1:15:49.167
Not even a "goodbye, Philippe."

1:15:54.740 --> 1:15:55.673
Now, she's gone.

1:15:58.220 --> 1:15:59.053
Forgotten.

1:16:03.330 --> 1:16:06.643
Revenge is the best measure of love.

1:16:30.060 --> 1:16:32.113
Paul was such a pretentious bastard.

1:16:35.240 --> 1:16:36.587
Good fuck though.

1:16:42.525 --> 1:16:44.358
Almost as good as you.

1:16:48.580 --> 1:16:50.993
Why?
- Why what?

1:16:51.840 --> 1:16:52.940
Cheat on me.

1:16:57.820 --> 1:16:59.270
- The same reason we cheated.

1:17:00.440 --> 1:17:04.000
The passion, the excitement, the chase-

1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:04.973
- And the romance?

1:17:08.740 --> 1:17:11.450
So, all of this was just-
- Was me.

1:17:11.450 --> 1:17:14.323
It was all about my pride and my ego.

1:17:16.290 --> 1:17:17.393
I am the guilty one.

1:17:18.340 --> 1:17:20.130
I made the first move.

1:17:20.130 --> 1:17:22.350
I chased her into bed.

1:17:22.350 --> 1:17:23.870
That's what you wanna hear, right?

1:17:23.870 --> 1:17:24.883
My confession.

1:17:30.670 --> 1:17:32.083
Help me make it right.

1:17:34.540 --> 1:17:36.143
- Well, Chloe needs her parents.

1:17:38.160 --> 1:17:39.403
- She needs both of us.

1:17:44.090 --> 1:17:46.790
- We all make mistakes from
time to time don't we, hm?

1:17:49.210 --> 1:17:51.850
- We're a family, we can get through this.

1:17:51.850 --> 1:17:52.683
- Maybe.

1:17:53.970 --> 1:17:55.720
People have come back
from much worse than this.

1:17:55.720 --> 1:17:56.553
I know that.

1:18:02.910 --> 1:18:07.743
Unfortunately, I don't see that happening.

1:18:10.196 --> 1:18:11.653
- What do you mean?

1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:14.413
- Oh, Philippe.

1:18:16.580 --> 1:18:20.280
I am so happy for you that
you've had your little insight.

1:18:23.020 --> 1:18:25.833
But your family's not a bad
deal in need of a fix here.

1:18:27.020 --> 1:18:27.853
- Fine.

1:18:29.520 --> 1:18:30.353
Divorce me.

1:18:31.200 --> 1:18:32.033
Take it all.

1:18:33.150 --> 1:18:35.580
I don't care about that shit anymore.

1:18:35.580 --> 1:18:37.740
All I care about is Chloe.

1:18:37.740 --> 1:18:39.720
So, let's come to some arrangement.

1:18:39.720 --> 1:18:42.910
- Jesus Christ.
- It doesn't have to be toxic.

1:18:42.910 --> 1:18:44.843
- I think we're past toxic, dear.

1:18:46.110 --> 1:18:47.920
- Don't punish her for my sins.

1:18:47.920 --> 1:18:50.890
- Don't you dare believe
that you're a martyr.

1:18:50.890 --> 1:18:53.360
Not for one fucking second.

1:18:53.360 --> 1:18:54.883
Now, you listen to me.

1:18:55.860 --> 1:18:58.943
What happens here happens
and for good reason.

1:19:09.060 --> 1:19:10.477
You are pathetic.

1:19:16.997 --> 1:19:19.303
- Add weak and childish to the list.

1:19:20.190 --> 1:19:23.580
Vain, arrogant, self obsessed.

1:19:23.580 --> 1:19:24.620
A martyr?

1:19:24.620 --> 1:19:25.453
No.

1:19:29.840 --> 1:19:33.543
I see what's important and
it's not me, it's Chloe.

1:19:47.382 --> 1:19:51.637
- You're never gonna
see your daughter again.

1:19:51.637 --> 1:19:55.260
- No, no!

1:19:55.260 --> 1:19:57.864
For Christ's sake, why?

1:19:57.864 --> 1:20:00.031
You selfish fucking bitch.

1:20:01.023 --> 1:20:04.153
Is all this really more
important than Chloe?

1:20:09.993 --> 1:20:14.993
- When we first got hitched,
pretty much the first weekend.

1:20:20.410 --> 1:20:22.097
Remember how good the sex was?

1:20:34.840 --> 1:20:37.223
I was already six weeks late, Philippe.

1:20:40.510 --> 1:20:41.360
Already pregnant.

1:20:45.080 --> 1:20:47.967
So, you see, you can't have Chloe.

1:20:49.970 --> 1:20:53.593
She's not even yours.

1:20:55.850 --> 1:20:57.100
- You're lying.

1:20:59.690 --> 1:21:01.793
- Why would I lie about my own daughter?

1:21:07.290 --> 1:21:08.903
She's everything to me.

1:21:12.262 --> 1:21:13.095
Not you.

1:21:18.900 --> 1:21:21.093
- You fucking bitch.

1:21:24.610 --> 1:21:26.610
You've been lying to me all these years?

1:21:29.040 --> 1:21:33.360
- Well, a girl has to
take care of herself.

1:21:48.685 --> 1:21:49.518
- Shit.

1:22:06.960 --> 1:22:09.260
Philippe, it's Nina.

1:22:09.260 --> 1:22:10.243
Rise and shine.

1:22:14.730 --> 1:22:15.840
I'm sorry it's late.

1:22:15.840 --> 1:22:17.090
Here's your wake-up call.

1:22:23.451 --> 1:22:24.284
Hello?

1:23:09.455 --> 1:23:10.288
Philippe?

1:23:19.280 --> 1:23:20.980
- You'll both go to jail for this.

1:23:46.877 --> 1:23:47.710
- Here.

1:23:56.310 --> 1:23:58.353
Might as well give it a go.

1:24:19.900 --> 1:24:22.283
- Fuck you, I'll never forget this.

1:24:32.412 --> 1:24:34.995
- So, there is no happy ending.

1:24:38.354 --> 1:24:40.790
No forgive and forget.

1:24:46.070 --> 1:24:49.387
- The way I see it,
you've got two options.

1:24:53.695 --> 1:24:56.112
You kill me or you let me go.

1:24:59.723 --> 1:25:02.963
If you let me go, I press charges.

1:25:05.550 --> 1:25:09.193
If you kill me, you go on the run.

1:25:11.840 --> 1:25:14.660
Either way you lose Chloe.

1:25:14.660 --> 1:25:16.083
You're willing to risk that?

1:25:25.100 --> 1:25:27.240
Revenge is the best measure of love.

1:25:38.750 --> 1:25:40.167
It's your choice.

1:25:47.329 --> 1:25:51.329
- Actually, I've just
thought of a third option.
