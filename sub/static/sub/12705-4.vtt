WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:03.637
(owl hooting)

00:03.670 --> 00:05.373
BUFFY:
 "One night after supper,

00:05.405 --> 00:09.076
"the lead dog turned up
 a snowshoe rabbit.

00:09.109 --> 00:11.244
"The dog lay down
 low to the race,

00:11.278 --> 00:15.249
"his body flashing forward,
 leap by leap.

00:15.282 --> 00:16.984
WILLOW AND BUFFY:
 "He was sounding
 the deeps of his nature

00:17.016 --> 00:20.521
"and the parts of his nature
that were deeper than he,

00:20.553 --> 00:22.890
"going back into
the wombs of time.

00:22.922 --> 00:25.259
The rabbit could not--"

00:25.292 --> 00:29.097
Okay, uh, maybe we should try
a less stimulating passage.

00:29.129 --> 00:31.832
XANDER: Private Harris
reporting for Oz watch.

00:31.864 --> 00:33.933
Xander!
Oh, good.

00:33.966 --> 00:35.536
Hmm.

00:35.569 --> 00:38.238
Oh.
"Call of the Wild."

00:38.271 --> 00:40.441
Aren't we reading the Cliff's
Notes to this for English?

00:40.473 --> 00:42.109
Some of us are.

00:42.143 --> 00:44.744
Anyway, it'll help
you stay awake.

00:44.777 --> 00:46.914
It's good
and very wolfy.

00:46.947 --> 00:49.549
It seems to soothe
the savage beast.

00:49.582 --> 00:52.520
(quietly): Except for the
parts about rabbits.

00:52.552 --> 00:54.521
(Oz roars)

00:54.554 --> 00:56.689
Rabbis?

00:56.723 --> 01:00.527
It seems to make him
a little overexcited.

01:00.561 --> 01:03.063
Okay, now, he's had
his 2:00 feeding,

01:03.097 --> 01:04.730
and, uh, after sunrise,

01:04.765 --> 01:06.400
if he forgets where
his clothes are,

01:06.433 --> 01:09.569
they're on top of the
file cabinet in his cage.

01:09.602 --> 01:11.572
I put those towels
up for privacy.

01:11.605 --> 01:14.408
Uh, no worries-- I can handle
the Oz, full monty.

01:14.442 --> 01:18.146
I mean, not handle-handle, like,
uh, hands-to-flesh handle.

01:18.179 --> 01:20.548
Okay, well, it's not for you.

01:20.581 --> 01:23.384
It's for me because I'm still
getting used to half a Monty.

01:23.417 --> 01:24.784
Oh, good.

01:24.817 --> 01:26.719
"Half"?
You and Oz?

01:26.754 --> 01:28.322
Which half?

01:28.355 --> 01:30.290
Wouldn't you like to know?

01:30.323 --> 01:33.093
Anyway, he's more manageable
tonight and on the third night.

01:33.127 --> 01:35.728
Tomorrow night,
the total full moon,

01:35.763 --> 01:37.798
that's when he's a real woofer.

01:37.831 --> 01:40.401
But in case there's
trouble-- there won't be,

01:40.433 --> 01:42.170
but if...
Sleepy time.

01:42.203 --> 01:44.003
Gotcha.

01:44.037 --> 01:45.805
Thanks again for doing this.

01:45.838 --> 01:47.841
I wouldn't have asked,
but I have this test.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.576
No big.
You can count on me.

01:49.609 --> 01:51.478
I got my coffee, magazines.

01:51.512 --> 01:53.079
Figured I'd read, maybe

01:53.112 --> 01:54.182
run the stairs
over there a little bit.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.448
I'm good.

01:59.887 --> 02:01.120
Bye.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.036
(growls)

02:16.068 --> 02:18.705
Nice place.

02:18.739 --> 02:22.509
Do you ever catch kids
doing the diddy out here?

02:22.543 --> 02:25.012
No, there's a smooch
spot up by the woods.

02:25.045 --> 02:27.146
That's usually
where kids go.

02:27.181 --> 02:28.481
Yeah?
Bet you and Scott

02:28.515 --> 02:30.217
have been up there
kicking the gearshift.

02:30.251 --> 02:31.651
Hardly.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.653
Only been on a few dates.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.989
But you like him,
and when you think about him,

02:36.022 --> 02:39.227
you get that good,
down-low tickle, right?

02:39.259 --> 02:41.861
Yeah, I guess, but--

02:41.895 --> 02:43.463
How low?

02:43.497 --> 02:44.798
(laughs)
You tell me.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.966
How about not?

02:47.000 --> 02:50.837
But he is... nice,
and he's funny.

02:50.871 --> 02:53.206
And quite a muffin.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.042
Blueberry.

02:55.074 --> 02:56.877
That crunchy,
munchy stuff on top.

02:56.909 --> 02:59.579
But my most favorite
thing so far

02:59.612 --> 03:02.181
is that he doesn't seem to
be any kind of hell beast.

03:02.216 --> 03:04.585
All men are beasts, Buffy.

03:04.617 --> 03:07.487
Okay, I was hoping
to not get that cynical

03:07.520 --> 03:09.223
till I was at least 40.

03:09.257 --> 03:11.191
It's not cynical.
I mean, it's realistic.

03:11.224 --> 03:13.193
Every guy from Manimal

03:13.227 --> 03:16.028
down to
Mr. "I Love The English Patient"

03:16.062 --> 03:17.664
has beast in him.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.167
And I don't care
how sensitive they act.

03:20.199 --> 03:22.469
They're all still
just in it for the chase.

03:27.074 --> 03:30.311
(heavy breathing)

03:36.484 --> 03:39.287
(screaming)

03:41.421 --> 03:45.091
(wolf howling)

03:45.125 --> 03:48.961
*

04:35.207 --> 04:37.610
WILLOW:
I don't think that's true,

04:37.644 --> 04:39.112
that every guy's in it
only for the chase.

04:39.146 --> 04:40.581
I know-- it is an
awful generalization.

04:40.613 --> 04:42.316
SCOTT:
Hey, Buffy.

04:46.353 --> 04:48.254
That's what I stopped
you for, basically. Hey.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.255
Okay.

04:49.288 --> 04:50.257
Hey.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.360
Howdy, Debbie.

04:52.393 --> 04:55.762
Hi, Oz. Hey, you're not
doing jazz band this year?

04:55.795 --> 04:57.497
Ooh, can't take the pressure.

04:57.531 --> 05:00.334
It's not the music that's hard,
it's the marching.

05:00.367 --> 05:02.168
We have a marching jazz band?

05:02.201 --> 05:04.004
OZ:
Yeah, but you know, since the
best jazz is improvisational,

05:04.036 --> 05:07.608
we'd be going off in all
directions, banging into floats.

05:07.641 --> 05:08.776
It's scary.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.343
He's just being Oz.

05:10.377 --> 05:12.480
Pretty much full-time.

05:12.512 --> 05:13.980
Those are pretty flowers.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.483
Thanks.
Pete brought them for me.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.718
Yeah. Well,
I'm sure Scott

05:17.750 --> 05:19.952
does that kind of stuff
for you, too, Buffy.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.822
Uh, well, we're
not up to flowers.

05:21.855 --> 05:23.824
Are we?
Up to flowers?

05:23.856 --> 05:25.324
Did I miss flowers?

05:25.358 --> 05:27.360
No. We're pre-posy.
Definitely.

05:27.394 --> 05:28.562
What time is it?

05:28.596 --> 05:31.632
Oh, I have to go see
Mr. Platt today.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.165
"Platt"?
The school counselor?

05:33.199 --> 05:34.634
BUFFY:
I get to convince him that

05:34.668 --> 05:36.569
I'm Little Miss Stable
so I can stay in school.

05:36.603 --> 05:39.072
Platt creeps me out.
I would totally quit going,

05:39.105 --> 05:40.641
but I'm flunking
Senior Bio,

05:40.673 --> 05:44.011
and my teacher says
I have success issues.

05:44.043 --> 05:45.545
OZ:
"Senior Bio"?

05:45.579 --> 05:46.913
I kind of aced that final.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.415
And how did you do that?

05:48.449 --> 05:50.550
Oh, right.
You showed up.

05:50.584 --> 05:52.886
If you want my notes,
they're yours.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.187
Thanks.
That'd be great.

05:54.221 --> 05:55.355
(school bell rings)

05:55.389 --> 05:56.524
We'd better go.

05:56.557 --> 05:57.957
I'll see you?
Yep.

06:03.963 --> 06:06.600
We have to recheck
every possible exit avenue.

06:06.634 --> 06:09.437
I'm telling you it's a waste
of time-- I was here all night.

06:09.470 --> 06:11.204
Right.

06:11.237 --> 06:13.841
It's good to see you.
Um, no need to panic.

06:13.874 --> 06:17.343
Just a thought--
Poker, not your game.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.678
WILLOW:
What's the deal, Giles?

06:18.711 --> 06:20.180
GILES:
Now, bear in mind,

06:20.213 --> 06:22.615
um, most likely,
th-there is no deal,

06:22.649 --> 06:26.286
but, uh if-if-if there
was a deal, then it, um,

06:26.319 --> 06:28.355
would concern
murder last night.

06:28.387 --> 06:31.524
Uh, a male student
was-was found in the woods.

06:31.559 --> 06:32.793
Which student?

06:32.826 --> 06:34.427
Jeff Orkin.

06:34.461 --> 06:36.997
Jeff?
He was--

06:38.398 --> 06:40.768
I knew him.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.401
I'm afraid he was,
he was, um, terribly mauled.

06:42.435 --> 06:43.637
Now, as-as much

06:43.670 --> 06:45.404
as I hate to think it,

06:45.439 --> 06:47.406
it-it could be
the handiwork of-of--

06:47.441 --> 06:48.442
Me.

06:48.475 --> 06:50.110
Wolf-you,
not you-you.

06:50.143 --> 06:51.444
XANDER:
But it's not.

06:51.478 --> 06:53.245
Not wolf-you, not you-you.

06:53.279 --> 06:55.716
The room was secured,
the gate was locked,

06:55.749 --> 06:58.185
and the window
unbreakable, and...

06:59.319 --> 07:01.053
Open.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.322
Oh, God.

07:02.355 --> 07:03.456
Oh, not to freak.

07:03.490 --> 07:04.658
I-I rested my eyes
now and then.

07:04.692 --> 07:06.459
That's all.

07:06.494 --> 07:07.894
GILES:
How long...

07:07.927 --> 07:11.064
exactly did you
rest your eyes for?

07:11.098 --> 07:12.264
XANDER:
A little now,

07:12.298 --> 07:13.500
uh, a little then,

07:13.533 --> 07:14.935
but I never heard Oz leave,

07:14.968 --> 07:17.504
and he was here
in the morning when I, um--

07:17.538 --> 07:19.238
when I--

07:19.271 --> 07:20.406
Woke up!

07:20.439 --> 07:21.742
You could put it that way

07:21.774 --> 07:23.511
if you want to, Mr. Technical.

07:27.279 --> 07:29.281
Oh, God.

07:42.529 --> 07:44.363
2:00.

07:44.396 --> 07:46.766
Miss Summers.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.168
Buffy Summers,

07:48.201 --> 07:50.237
reporting for sanity.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.874
Look, I know that
I have to do this,

07:53.906 --> 07:55.509
and I'll cooperate,

07:55.543 --> 07:57.677
and I'll look at your ink blots
and everything,

07:57.711 --> 08:00.947
but I don't want to talk
about my life or my childhood

08:00.980 --> 08:04.317
or anything
for that matter, actually.

08:04.350 --> 08:07.120
And, uh, I don't want
to be friends here.

08:07.153 --> 08:10.690
We're not gonna be friends.

08:10.723 --> 08:14.562
You have friends
already... I hope.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.730
I mean, friends are
a good thing, mm-hmm.

08:16.764 --> 08:19.499
They like you, agree with you,

08:19.533 --> 08:22.334
tell you what you want to hear.

08:22.369 --> 08:24.204
That's not what
you need right now.

08:24.237 --> 08:26.874
What you need is a trained,

08:26.906 --> 08:29.509
not-too-crazy professional,

08:29.543 --> 08:32.913
who will always give you
his honest opinion.

08:35.749 --> 08:38.350
Which I offer you.

08:38.384 --> 08:41.354
Have a seat.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.424
"Not too crazy"?

08:45.457 --> 08:47.494
Those are your credentials?

08:47.527 --> 08:50.163
Look, Buffy,

08:50.197 --> 08:51.731
any person--

08:51.764 --> 08:55.402
grown-up, shrink, Pope--

08:55.434 --> 08:58.838
any person who claims
to be totally sane

08:58.871 --> 09:02.174
is either lying
or not very bright.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.745
I mean,
everyone has problems.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.546
Everybody has demons, right?

09:08.048 --> 09:10.017
Got to say I'm with you on that.

09:10.049 --> 09:11.619
Excellent.

09:11.652 --> 09:16.423
So, the hope I bring you
is demons can be fought.

09:16.456 --> 09:18.258
People can change.

09:18.291 --> 09:19.392
You...

09:19.426 --> 09:21.561
can change.

09:21.595 --> 09:23.129
Now, your turn.

09:23.163 --> 09:26.533
Let's start
with why you ran away.

09:26.566 --> 09:27.900
That's a long story.

09:27.934 --> 09:29.536
Mm-hmm.

09:29.568 --> 09:30.971
Bore me.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.940
You know,
I'm-I'm really over it.

09:32.972 --> 09:34.942
I-I'm moving on.
I feel good.

09:34.975 --> 09:37.110
I'm, I'm even dating
someone new.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.778
All good things.

09:38.812 --> 09:40.648
But still, you're,
you're bringing me in

09:40.681 --> 09:43.115
at the end of the movie.

09:44.985 --> 09:47.620
I was dating someone.

09:47.654 --> 09:50.090
Uh, it-it ended badly.

09:50.123 --> 09:52.091
My mom and I were fighting,

09:52.125 --> 09:55.962
and I kind of freaked.

09:55.995 --> 09:57.563
Well, tell me more
about this guy,

09:57.596 --> 09:59.832
the bad-ending guy.

10:05.272 --> 10:09.677
He was my first...

10:09.710 --> 10:11.477
I loved him.

10:11.510 --> 10:13.413
And then he--

10:13.446 --> 10:15.682
Changed.

10:15.716 --> 10:17.850
Yeah.

10:17.884 --> 10:19.286
He got mean.

10:19.318 --> 10:21.654
Yes.

10:21.688 --> 10:23.856
And you didn't stop loving him.

10:25.692 --> 10:27.094
Look.

10:27.126 --> 10:28.662
Lots of people
lose themselves in love.

10:28.696 --> 10:29.697
It's-it's no shame.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.463
They write songs about it.

10:31.498 --> 10:34.701
The hitch is you can't

10:34.735 --> 10:36.436
stay lost.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.004
Sooner or later, you,

10:38.038 --> 10:40.673
you have to get back
to yourself.

10:40.707 --> 10:43.976
And if you can't?

10:44.010 --> 10:47.147
If you can't...

10:47.179 --> 10:49.649
well, love becomes your master,

10:49.682 --> 10:53.253
and you're just its dog.

11:03.395 --> 11:06.365
I'm afraid to ask.

11:06.399 --> 11:08.067
Oz ate someone
last night.

11:08.100 --> 11:10.037
He did not!
XANDER:
Oz does not eat people.

11:10.070 --> 11:12.205
It's more werewolf play.

11:12.239 --> 11:14.573
You know, I bat you around a
little bit, like a cat toy.

11:14.606 --> 11:16.710
I have harmless wolf fun.
Is it Oz's fault that,

11:16.744 --> 11:18.644
you know, side effect,
people get cut to ribbons,

11:18.677 --> 11:20.580
and maybe then he'll
take a little nibble and--

11:20.613 --> 11:23.015
I-I'm not helping, am I?

11:23.049 --> 11:24.017
No.

11:24.051 --> 11:25.585
Oz may have got out

11:25.618 --> 11:26.754
of his cage last night.

11:26.787 --> 11:27.988
OZ:
Or maybe there's a,

11:28.020 --> 11:28.989
another werewolf
roaming the woods.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.090
Perhaps.

11:30.123 --> 11:31.258
Perhaps it's something else

11:31.291 --> 11:32.259
entirely.

11:32.292 --> 11:33.659
BUFFY:
It's okay.

11:33.692 --> 11:34.727
Uh, we'll work together,

11:34.761 --> 11:36.596
And we'll figure this out.

11:36.629 --> 11:37.730
Yes, um, Buffy.

11:37.764 --> 11:39.566
You, uh, you
patrol the woods.

11:39.599 --> 11:41.934
Uh, the others,
check out the morgue.

11:41.969 --> 11:45.337
Right, we can see if
it's a werewolf kill or not.

11:45.371 --> 11:47.606
But what about Oz?

11:47.639 --> 11:49.942
Um, well, I have
some research materials

11:49.976 --> 11:51.077
at home I need to look at.

11:51.110 --> 11:53.046
Uh...
(stammers)

11:53.080 --> 11:54.881
we could ask Faith
to watch over him.

11:54.914 --> 11:57.350
What, you're having
a slayer watch me?

11:57.384 --> 11:59.385
Oh, good we're not overreacting.

12:05.591 --> 12:08.227
Okay, you know that thing
where you bail

12:08.260 --> 12:10.230
in the middle
of an upsetting conversation?

12:10.263 --> 12:12.065
I have to do that.

12:12.099 --> 12:13.966
It's kind of dramatic, I know,

12:14.000 --> 12:16.568
but sometimes,
it's a necessary guy thing.

12:16.602 --> 12:19.639
And I want you
to do the guy thing,

12:19.672 --> 12:22.109
but...

12:28.648 --> 12:31.018
(sighs)

12:43.596 --> 12:46.066
Oz?

12:46.099 --> 12:49.135
Get away from the cage.

12:50.702 --> 12:52.672
What?

12:52.705 --> 12:56.475
It's gonna happen soon.

13:00.013 --> 13:02.014
Get away from me.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.847
(grunts)

13:36.716 --> 13:39.186
(growling)

13:46.826 --> 13:48.260
(growls)

13:53.665 --> 13:55.668
(both grunting)

14:21.360 --> 14:23.763
*

14:40.547 --> 14:42.349
Oh, God!

14:42.381 --> 14:44.783
Here, hold this.

14:49.422 --> 14:52.359
(both gasp)

14:52.392 --> 14:53.559
We're doing crime here.

14:53.592 --> 14:55.294
You don't sneak up during crime.

14:55.327 --> 14:57.364
God, have a--
Okay!

14:57.397 --> 14:59.066
Scarred for life.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.432
Oh, God.

15:00.466 --> 15:02.802
Willow, how can you stand it?

15:02.835 --> 15:05.972
Yeah, Will, I mean,
this guy is pretty barf-worthy.

15:06.005 --> 15:07.440
Uh, can't we be elsewhere?

15:07.474 --> 15:09.976
You know, is-is Oz
cleared or what, huh?

15:10.009 --> 15:11.378
I'm not sure.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.312
I mean, there are
a lot of incised wounds,

15:13.346 --> 15:15.881
but they could be from anything.

15:15.914 --> 15:18.585
Anything with big,
sharp teeth and vicious--

15:18.618 --> 15:20.052
Do you want to go back
to the car and wait?

15:20.086 --> 15:21.587
No. God.

15:21.620 --> 15:23.655
I'm just saying--

15:23.690 --> 15:25.825
Almost done-- let me just get
a few stray hairs from the body.

15:25.857 --> 15:28.427
They could be from the attacker.

15:28.461 --> 15:29.395
Great, so we got
everything we need?

15:29.428 --> 15:30.663
Yep, that's it.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.432
(gasps)

15:32.465 --> 15:33.899
Oh!

15:33.932 --> 15:36.003
Okay. Uh, little
too much excitement

15:36.036 --> 15:37.470
for the Wilster here.

15:37.504 --> 15:40.006
Doesn't look good
for Oz, does it?

15:40.039 --> 15:43.309
It really doesn't.

15:43.342 --> 15:47.213
This guy was ripped apart
by a big, wild animal.

16:05.798 --> 16:08.201
(snarling)

16:19.145 --> 16:21.548
(growling)

16:38.498 --> 16:40.899
(muffled rock music playing)

16:48.040 --> 16:49.142
(gasps)

16:49.176 --> 16:50.309
Oh!

16:50.342 --> 16:52.044
Oh! Uh, Buffy.
Are you okay?

16:52.078 --> 16:54.047
What are you doing here?

16:54.081 --> 16:57.584
Uh, bleeding internally,
but I'll live.

16:57.616 --> 16:58.717
God, I'm sorry.

16:58.750 --> 17:00.220
I guess I didn't hear you.

17:00.253 --> 17:01.687
Figured as much.

17:01.721 --> 17:04.691
Ow, again.
Uh, actually,

17:04.723 --> 17:08.260
I-I came to give you
the rest of the night off.

17:08.295 --> 17:09.996
Get out of jail free, huh?
How come?

17:10.028 --> 17:11.498
Well, couldn't sleep.

17:11.530 --> 17:14.067
Figured I'd, uh, cram
for my French test.

17:14.101 --> 17:16.169
That's cool. I was going
kind of crazy in here,

17:16.202 --> 17:18.171
But I can get in a few
stakings before sunrise.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.073
Knock yourself out.

17:20.106 --> 17:21.772
Not literally, though.

17:21.807 --> 17:23.809
FAITH:
Yeah.
Later.

17:25.444 --> 17:27.880
(Oz snarling)

17:54.973 --> 17:57.344
*

18:08.621 --> 18:10.557
Hey.

18:10.589 --> 18:11.923
Hmm.

18:11.958 --> 18:13.359
Hello.

18:15.162 --> 18:17.396
Oh... boy.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.965
Faith and her nutty books.

18:19.999 --> 18:21.433
Exploring Demon
 Dimensions

18:21.468 --> 18:24.436
and Mystery of Acathla.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.506
Yeah, and she still
listens to heavy metal.

18:26.538 --> 18:28.941
Freaky deaky.

18:28.974 --> 18:31.544
Buffy?

18:35.182 --> 18:38.518
What if...
I told you that...

18:38.550 --> 18:41.354
I had a dream about Angel,

18:41.387 --> 18:44.990
and, um, it brought up
some questions?

18:45.023 --> 18:48.861
I'd say it was
to be expected.

18:48.894 --> 18:50.663
Must've been some dream.

18:50.697 --> 18:53.165
I didn't think you knew
what a card index was for.

18:56.202 --> 18:59.038
I dreamt
that he came back.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.410
Of course.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.814
After Jenny was killed,

19:07.846 --> 19:10.383
I had dreams that
she was still alive,

19:10.416 --> 19:12.551
that I saved her.

19:12.585 --> 19:14.987
But this was vivid.

19:15.020 --> 19:16.556
Really vivid.

19:16.588 --> 19:18.191
Three dimensional,
Sensurround,

19:18.224 --> 19:20.058
"The Hills are Alive."

19:21.594 --> 19:23.563
Do you believe
it was a prophecy?

19:23.596 --> 19:24.797
No.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.566
I don't know.

19:26.598 --> 19:28.701
I... I guess it just,

19:28.734 --> 19:30.769
it made me wonder.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.906
Is there a chance even?

19:34.941 --> 19:36.909
Could it happen?

19:36.942 --> 19:39.077
Well, there's
no record

19:39.111 --> 19:41.180
of anyone returning
from a demon dimension

19:41.213 --> 19:43.816
once the gate was closed.

19:43.849 --> 19:47.686
I-I-I can't imagine
how it could happen or-or why.

19:49.288 --> 19:52.692
Let's just pretend
for a second that...

19:52.724 --> 19:56.596
Angel somehow found his way
back to Sunnydale.

19:56.628 --> 19:59.898
What would he be like?

19:59.932 --> 20:01.933
I really can't say.

20:01.968 --> 20:05.104
From what is known
about that dimension,

20:05.136 --> 20:09.709
it-it would suggest a
world of brutal torment.

20:09.741 --> 20:13.712
And time moves quite
differently there, so--

20:13.746 --> 20:15.714
I remember.

20:15.748 --> 20:20.619
So he would have been down there
for hundreds of years?

20:20.653 --> 20:22.221
Yes.

20:22.255 --> 20:24.457
Of torture.

20:24.490 --> 20:27.527
It would take someone
of extraordinary

20:27.559 --> 20:30.128
will and character

20:30.162 --> 20:33.766
to survive that and, uh,
retain any semblance of self.

20:33.799 --> 20:36.736
Most likely,
he'd be-be a monster.

20:36.769 --> 20:40.205
A lost cause?

20:40.239 --> 20:41.907
Maybe.

20:41.941 --> 20:43.742
Maybe not.

20:43.776 --> 20:47.380
In my experience, there
are two types of monster.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.115
The first, uh,
can be redeemed,

20:49.147 --> 20:52.117
or more importantly,
 wants to be redeemed.

20:52.151 --> 20:55.322
And the second type?

20:55.355 --> 20:59.157
The second is void of humanity.

20:59.191 --> 21:01.227
Cannot respond to reason

21:01.259 --> 21:04.330
or love.

21:07.799 --> 21:08.934
I thought Faith was on duty.

21:08.968 --> 21:11.403
Oh, hey.
Change of plans.

21:11.438 --> 21:13.306
Glazed or cake?

21:13.339 --> 21:15.240
It's fun to watch
them make them.

21:15.273 --> 21:16.576
They use this spritzy thing,

21:16.608 --> 21:18.176
and they drop the
batter into this--

21:18.210 --> 21:19.578
Couldn't sleep, huh?

21:19.612 --> 21:21.146
I've been at Mr. Donut

21:21.180 --> 21:24.150
since the TV
did the snowy thing.

21:24.182 --> 21:25.852
How come you're
the wakey girl?

21:25.884 --> 21:28.153
I mean, this time,
it's not your boyfriend

21:28.186 --> 21:30.490
who's the cold-blooded--

21:30.522 --> 21:32.991
Jelly doughnut?

21:33.025 --> 21:34.794
Everything all right?

21:34.826 --> 21:36.929
Yeah.
Uh...

21:36.962 --> 21:38.664
what happened with
the inspection of the body?

21:38.698 --> 21:39.766
Anyone?

21:39.798 --> 21:41.200
They're yummy, delicious.

21:41.232 --> 21:42.268
Will, come on.

21:42.300 --> 21:43.369
Was it werewolf?

21:44.737 --> 21:46.939
Was it a vampire?

21:46.972 --> 21:48.207
It-it wasn't conclusive.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.608
How could it not be conclusive?

21:49.642 --> 21:51.009
What did it look like?
Was he bit?

21:51.042 --> 21:52.444
GILES:
Let her finish, Buffy.

21:52.479 --> 21:55.080
No, it's just--

21:58.317 --> 22:00.318
I'm sorry.

22:05.392 --> 22:06.858
(indistinct chatter)

22:06.893 --> 22:08.428
Buffy, over here.

22:10.229 --> 22:11.397
Hey.

22:11.431 --> 22:13.465
Hey.
Uh, I can't,

22:13.500 --> 22:15.000
I can't back you on that lunch.

22:15.034 --> 22:17.068
Nutritional demerits.

22:17.103 --> 22:20.740
Oh, my stomach doesn't
want hard food today.

22:20.772 --> 22:22.474
But there's fruit in it.

22:22.509 --> 22:24.210
Those are
marshmallows.

22:24.242 --> 22:25.277
Oh.

22:26.512 --> 22:28.580
I'm, I'm really out of it today.

22:28.615 --> 22:30.682
I didn't sleep well
last night.

22:30.717 --> 22:33.085
Just don't tell Mr. Platt
you have insomnia.

22:33.118 --> 22:34.686
He'll make you
start a dream journal.

22:34.721 --> 22:36.823
PETE: What's that--
like a Barbie thing?

22:36.855 --> 22:39.057
Dear Dream Journal, how
come Ken hasn't come around

22:39.090 --> 22:40.393
since he got that earring?

22:40.426 --> 22:42.260
I never did it.
He's a quack.

22:42.294 --> 22:43.730
I kind of liked him.

22:43.762 --> 22:45.597
Really?

22:45.632 --> 22:48.835
I... I guess he's
kind of funny and stuff.

22:48.867 --> 22:51.938
It's just, sometimes I just
don't like the things he says.

22:51.971 --> 22:54.272
Oh, he definitely marches

22:54.306 --> 22:56.375
to the beat of his own drummer.

22:56.409 --> 22:58.611
Actually, I think
he makes his own drums.

22:58.644 --> 23:00.547
Well, my mom says that therapy
can be completely helpful.

23:00.579 --> 23:02.013
Yeah, but your mom

23:02.048 --> 23:04.349
has the wattage of
a Zippo lighter, Scott.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.519
I hope you realize I don't
actually know these people.

23:06.553 --> 23:08.887
I just, I thought you would
like me better if I had friends,

23:08.921 --> 23:10.321
so I hired them.

23:11.624 --> 23:15.461
So... I, uh,

23:15.494 --> 23:18.029
I wanted to tell you
that you look great today.

23:18.064 --> 23:19.932
But now I want to raise
that to amazing

23:19.965 --> 23:22.134
because you didn't sleep well.

23:22.167 --> 23:24.202
Uh...

23:24.236 --> 23:26.972
that's really sweet.
Um...

23:27.006 --> 23:30.209
and I wish
I-I didn't have to,

23:30.241 --> 23:33.480
I-I just remembered that I do,
so I'll, I'll see you later.

23:33.512 --> 23:35.481
Uh, yeah.

23:35.515 --> 23:38.984
Check out Scotty liking
the manic-depressive chick.

23:50.797 --> 23:53.199
(heavy breathing)

24:21.393 --> 24:23.863
Angel?

24:28.567 --> 24:31.069
Do you understand me?

24:55.161 --> 24:56.863
(growling)

25:08.607 --> 25:11.376
(indistinct chatter)

25:11.410 --> 25:13.311
Debbie, come on.
Just for a minute.

25:13.345 --> 25:15.381
No, I can't.
I have to meet a friend.

25:15.413 --> 25:17.616
So you'll be late,
but happy.

25:19.518 --> 25:22.555
(laughs)

25:29.028 --> 25:30.528
(both chuckle)

25:30.563 --> 25:32.064
No, no.
Let's stay here.

25:32.097 --> 25:34.567
Relax, Debbie.
What's wrong with you today?

25:40.573 --> 25:41.907
What is that?

25:43.142 --> 25:44.109
Nothing.

25:44.143 --> 25:45.544
Kiss me.

25:45.577 --> 25:46.945
No. Debbie, you did not
drink that, did you?

25:46.979 --> 25:48.380
Drink it?

25:48.413 --> 25:50.182
You know I didn't.

25:50.215 --> 25:51.983
Debbie, what's going on?

25:56.055 --> 25:57.455
2:00.
Buffy Summers, right?

25:57.489 --> 25:59.391
Wait.

25:59.424 --> 26:01.227
Don't turn around, okay?

26:01.259 --> 26:03.229
And don't-don't say anything.

26:03.261 --> 26:04.864
Just listen.

26:04.896 --> 26:07.666
I mean, that's,
that's your thing, right?

26:09.669 --> 26:12.038
There's something going on.

26:12.070 --> 26:15.106
I mean, this whole entire story
is probably gonna convince you

26:15.141 --> 26:16.742
that I'm loony-bin material,

26:16.776 --> 26:18.744
but...

26:18.778 --> 26:21.547
there's nobody else
that I can talk to.

26:21.579 --> 26:24.983
Not Willow and not Giles.

26:25.017 --> 26:27.219
Nobody.

26:27.252 --> 26:28.921
They'd, if they found out,
they'd freak on me

26:28.954 --> 26:31.089
or they'd do something.

26:31.123 --> 26:33.525
And...

26:34.292 --> 26:36.863
...I need help.

26:39.164 --> 26:42.101
I just, I need to talk
to someone.

26:45.171 --> 26:47.373
I'm so scared.

26:48.708 --> 26:50.777
It's this guy.

26:50.809 --> 26:53.511
H-He...

26:59.652 --> 27:01.688
He's come back.

27:13.031 --> 27:15.334
So...

27:15.366 --> 27:18.604
the bottle just...
jumped out of the cabinet,

27:18.636 --> 27:20.372
and spilled on its own.

27:20.405 --> 27:21.807
Of course not.

27:21.840 --> 27:23.976
I-I was trying to get rid of it.

27:24.009 --> 27:26.444
You were trying
to get rid of it?

27:26.478 --> 27:27.479
To help you.

27:27.512 --> 27:29.147
You know how you get.

27:29.181 --> 27:32.852
You think this has anything
to do with how I get?

27:32.884 --> 27:34.452
Well, when you
drink it--

27:34.486 --> 27:35.855
When I drink it?

27:35.887 --> 27:37.655
Nothing, Debbie.

27:37.690 --> 27:38.857
Nothing!

27:38.891 --> 27:40.625
I don't need this
anymore, okay?

27:40.659 --> 27:44.496
I am way, way past
that now-- you see?

27:44.529 --> 27:45.731
(glass breaks)

27:45.765 --> 27:47.733
You see?

27:47.767 --> 27:49.234
No more.

27:51.002 --> 27:52.304
You could pour out

27:52.337 --> 27:55.173
everything I made,
and it wouldn't help.

27:55.207 --> 27:56.742
And you want to know why?

27:58.044 --> 27:59.411
You want to know why?

27:59.444 --> 28:00.980
Because all it takes now

28:01.012 --> 28:02.580
is you, Debbie.

28:02.614 --> 28:05.483
You and your stupid,
grating voice!

28:05.517 --> 28:07.519
(grunting)

28:07.553 --> 28:09.355
(gasps)

28:17.695 --> 28:20.365
You're the reason I started
the formulas in the first place.

28:20.398 --> 28:23.234
To be the man you wanted.

28:23.269 --> 28:26.404
And you pay me back how?

28:26.438 --> 28:28.707
By whoring around
with other guys and taunting me!

28:28.740 --> 28:30.209
No, I don't!
I don't even look!

28:30.241 --> 28:31.210
(screams)

28:31.242 --> 28:33.545
(grunts)

28:33.578 --> 28:35.681
Is that something your shrink
taught you, Debbie?

28:35.713 --> 28:36.682
Huh?

28:36.714 --> 28:37.950
Huh, to share?

28:37.983 --> 28:39.050
To communicate?

28:39.085 --> 28:40.652
To piss me off?

28:42.421 --> 28:44.957
Well, guess what?

28:44.990 --> 28:46.959
Even he's not going to listen

28:46.992 --> 28:50.028
to your pathetic ramblings
anymore.

28:50.061 --> 28:51.864
I am all

28:51.897 --> 28:54.400
you've got now, Debbie.

28:54.432 --> 28:56.301
Do you hear me?

28:56.335 --> 28:58.805
I am all you've got!

29:00.306 --> 29:03.241
(sobbing)

29:08.646 --> 29:10.415
Oh, my God.

29:17.288 --> 29:19.191
(whispering):
Hey, Debbie.

29:20.326 --> 29:22.994
Hey, listen.

29:23.028 --> 29:25.964
You know
you shouldn't make me mad.

29:25.998 --> 29:28.467
Huh?
You know what happens.

29:30.336 --> 29:31.769
Debbie, please.

29:31.804 --> 29:33.806
Are you all right?

29:42.513 --> 29:44.115
It's okay.

29:48.519 --> 29:50.122
It's okay.

29:51.522 --> 29:53.692
This creature
is especially brutal.

29:53.724 --> 29:55.862
I believe the phrase
coined by the coroner

29:55.894 --> 29:58.197
when describing Mr. Platt
was "pureed."

29:58.230 --> 30:00.266
But he did confirm that

30:00.298 --> 30:02.300
Platt was killed shortly
before Buffy found him.

30:02.334 --> 30:04.135
FAITH:
Which means that he was
killed during the day.

30:04.170 --> 30:05.503
Yes!

30:06.505 --> 30:08.007
Sorry, I-I got--

30:08.039 --> 30:09.875
I've just been--

30:09.909 --> 30:11.609
It's horrible,
horrible.

30:11.643 --> 30:13.378
It's okay, Will.

30:13.412 --> 30:15.013
We're all glad
Oz is off the hook.

30:15.047 --> 30:17.449
GILES:
Indeed.

30:17.482 --> 30:18.784
Shouldn't he be here by now?

30:18.817 --> 30:20.486
Sunset's at 5:30.

30:28.359 --> 30:30.162
Sorry I'm late!

30:30.195 --> 30:32.964
Did you bring the notes?

30:32.999 --> 30:36.701
Yeah, um... you okay?

30:36.734 --> 30:38.836
What?
Oh, yeah.

30:38.871 --> 30:41.373
I'm, I'm such a klutz.

30:41.406 --> 30:43.474
I, I, um, oh--

30:43.509 --> 30:44.843
Fell down?

30:44.876 --> 30:47.145
Hit your... eye?

30:47.179 --> 30:49.347
Doorknob.

30:49.381 --> 30:50.715
Um... thanks.

30:50.749 --> 30:51.951
Hey, um...

30:54.953 --> 30:57.189
If you want to talk...

31:01.059 --> 31:03.828
Thanks again for the notes.

31:03.862 --> 31:06.031
Yeah.

31:13.972 --> 31:15.707
GILES:
Our task now is to determine

31:15.740 --> 31:17.175
what sort of killer
we are dealing with.

31:17.209 --> 31:18.277
Clearly, we're looking

31:18.309 --> 31:20.913
for a depraved,
sadistic animal.

31:20.946 --> 31:22.713
Present.

31:22.748 --> 31:24.951
Hey, I may be a cold-blooded
jelly doughnut,

31:24.983 --> 31:26.617
but my timing is impeccable.
But you aren't.

31:26.652 --> 31:28.619
It's-it's
a kill-in-the-day monster.

31:28.653 --> 31:30.622
100% for sure.

31:31.958 --> 31:33.592
Okay.

31:33.625 --> 31:35.193
GILES:
I wish we had time

31:35.227 --> 31:37.395
to celebrate properly,
however, we have

31:37.429 --> 31:38.797
two victims--

31:38.829 --> 31:41.232
Jeff Orkin
and, uh, now Platt.

31:41.267 --> 31:44.635
Maybe there's something
they had in common.

31:44.670 --> 31:46.572
Missing internal organs?

31:46.605 --> 31:48.106
Besides that.

31:48.140 --> 31:49.141
Debbie.

31:49.174 --> 31:51.210
Well, victim number one, Jeff.

31:51.242 --> 31:52.411
He was in jazz band with us.

31:52.443 --> 31:53.711
They used to horse around.

31:53.744 --> 31:54.980
They were screwing?

31:56.347 --> 31:58.317
I don't think so.

31:58.349 --> 32:01.287
But he her Music
Comp book once.

32:01.319 --> 32:02.788
And we know that
Debbie knew Platt.

32:02.820 --> 32:04.222
I mean, she was seeing him
and way vocal

32:04.256 --> 32:05.891
about not having love
for the guy.

32:05.923 --> 32:07.326
OZ: Add this
and stir.

32:07.358 --> 32:08.594
I just saw Debbie a minute ago

32:08.626 --> 32:10.761
sporting a nasty black eye.

32:10.796 --> 32:13.265
Okay, so pretend Debbie
wanted Platt dead.

32:13.298 --> 32:14.833
Maybe he fought back.

32:14.865 --> 32:16.602
No.

32:16.634 --> 32:18.237
Platt was dead
in an instant.

32:18.269 --> 32:21.307
He didn't even drop
his cigarette.

32:22.840 --> 32:24.977
Now, what if boyfriend Pete

32:25.010 --> 32:27.179
is the one doling out
the punishment?

32:27.212 --> 32:29.681
We should find them
both immediately.

32:29.714 --> 32:31.682
Well, Debbie was in
the quad a minute ago.

32:31.717 --> 32:32.851
All right, we'll split up.

32:32.884 --> 32:34.619
Um, Faith, you and I team.

32:34.653 --> 32:36.021
Willow, stick with Buffy.

32:36.055 --> 32:39.325
And I'll...
go lock myself in the cage.

32:55.473 --> 32:58.943
It's tricky, covering
a fresh shiner like that.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.846
You know what works?

33:00.878 --> 33:02.681
What?

33:02.713 --> 33:04.715
Don't get hit.

33:09.055 --> 33:10.489
What's going on, Debbie?

33:10.521 --> 33:12.057
I'll bet the farm you know.

33:12.090 --> 33:14.160
You're wrong.
I don't know anything.

33:14.192 --> 33:17.063
Normally, I'd say, "You want to
play 'I Have A Secret,' fine."

33:17.096 --> 33:19.530
But people are dying here.

33:23.769 --> 33:25.237
It--

33:25.270 --> 33:26.904
It's not his fault.

33:26.938 --> 33:28.906
I mean, he's not himself
when he gets like this.

33:28.940 --> 33:30.842
You mean Pete.

33:30.875 --> 33:32.644
It's me.

33:32.677 --> 33:34.011
I make him crazy.

33:34.046 --> 33:35.213
He just does what he does

33:35.247 --> 33:36.815
because he loves me too much.

33:36.847 --> 33:38.650
WILLOW:
But weren't Mr. Platt and Jeff

33:38.683 --> 33:40.086
murdered by an animal?

33:40.118 --> 33:41.420
Pete's not
like other guys--

33:41.452 --> 33:43.454
is he, Debbie?

33:45.022 --> 33:46.192
I-I've got to go.

33:46.224 --> 33:47.992
You have to talk to us.

33:48.026 --> 33:50.729
We can't help you
until you do.

33:50.761 --> 33:52.431
I didn't ask for your help.

33:52.463 --> 33:54.333
Well, when are you going to?
I mean, if Pete kills you,

33:54.365 --> 33:56.234
it'll pretty much be too late.

33:56.268 --> 33:59.404
Debbie, we're
running out of time.

34:02.039 --> 34:03.942
(grunting)

34:13.784 --> 34:15.121
Where can we find him?

34:15.152 --> 34:17.021
I-I don't know.

34:17.054 --> 34:18.556
You're lying.
What if I am?

34:18.590 --> 34:20.525
What are you gonna do about it?

34:20.559 --> 34:21.927
Wrong question.

34:23.728 --> 34:26.565
Look at yourself.

34:26.597 --> 34:29.467
Why are you protecting him?

34:29.501 --> 34:32.737
Anybody who really loved you
couldn't do this to you.

34:36.806 --> 34:39.411
Would they take
him someplace?

34:40.811 --> 34:42.380
Probably.

34:42.414 --> 34:45.650
I could never do that to him.

34:45.684 --> 34:48.219
I'm his everything.

34:48.253 --> 34:49.788
Great.

34:49.820 --> 34:51.657
So while you two live out
your Grimm fairy tale,

34:51.690 --> 34:53.125
two people are dead.

34:55.661 --> 34:58.028
Who's gonna be next?

35:00.599 --> 35:02.134
(door opens)

35:03.469 --> 35:04.936
PETE:
Since when

35:04.969 --> 35:08.139
do you touch my girl?

35:08.173 --> 35:09.907
Hey, Pete.

35:09.940 --> 35:11.876
This is kind of a bad time.

35:14.012 --> 35:15.981
Well, I guess you didn't
think about that

35:16.014 --> 35:18.184
when you put the moves
on Debbie!

35:19.885 --> 35:22.454
We talked, yeah,
but it was move-free.

35:22.487 --> 35:23.789
(rattles cage)

35:23.822 --> 35:25.856
About this cage?

35:25.891 --> 35:27.193
When that sun sets--

35:27.226 --> 35:29.360
You won't be alive

35:29.394 --> 35:30.429
to see it.

35:30.461 --> 35:31.530
(rattles cage)

35:35.367 --> 35:37.168
I'm serious.

35:37.202 --> 35:40.271
Something's gonna happen
that you probably won't believe.

35:40.306 --> 35:42.307
(Pete grunting)

35:47.512 --> 35:49.880
Or you might.

35:55.186 --> 35:56.688
(growls)

36:03.695 --> 36:04.829
He does love me.

36:04.862 --> 36:06.297
He does love me.

36:06.331 --> 36:08.132
This is useless.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.668
We have to go.
I have to find Pete.

36:09.701 --> 36:10.969
He does love me.

36:11.001 --> 36:11.969
Come on.

36:12.003 --> 36:13.239
He does love me.

36:13.271 --> 36:14.373
I think
we broke her.

36:14.405 --> 36:15.673
DEBBIE:
He does love me.

36:15.706 --> 36:17.175
He does
love me.

36:17.208 --> 36:21.179
I think she was broken
before this.

36:26.016 --> 36:28.119
(both grunting)

36:29.119 --> 36:30.655
Did you kiss that whore?

36:30.688 --> 36:31.989
Huh?

36:32.023 --> 36:34.025
Did she like it?

36:44.369 --> 36:46.271
Time's up.

36:46.304 --> 36:48.139
Rules change.

36:51.976 --> 36:53.978
(growling)

37:07.559 --> 37:09.126
Aah!

37:09.159 --> 37:11.429
(Pete screaming)

37:11.463 --> 37:13.465
What was that?

37:13.498 --> 37:15.766
(growling)

37:16.902 --> 37:18.869
Get the dart gun!
Got it!

37:18.903 --> 37:20.038
Pete, watch out!

37:20.070 --> 37:21.472
Ow!

37:21.507 --> 37:23.041
Oh!
Sorry.

37:23.074 --> 37:25.277
Oh, right.
Bloody priceless.

37:31.115 --> 37:32.483
You get the wolf.

37:32.518 --> 37:33.918
Got it.

37:59.143 --> 38:00.478
(grunting)

38:22.367 --> 38:23.469
Pete!

38:23.501 --> 38:24.536
You're all right!

38:24.570 --> 38:26.137
God, you're all right.

38:26.170 --> 38:27.539
She almost shot you.

38:27.572 --> 38:29.641
Did you see?

38:29.675 --> 38:32.411
I stopped her.

38:34.380 --> 38:36.213
You have to leave.

38:36.246 --> 38:37.682
Get out of Sunnydale.

38:37.715 --> 38:39.117
She knows.

38:39.150 --> 38:40.818
How did she know, Debbie?

38:40.851 --> 38:42.152
Did you

38:42.186 --> 38:44.121
run your big mouth?
No.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.155
She just knew.

38:45.190 --> 38:46.891
It seemed like she just knew.

38:46.925 --> 38:48.793
So you filled in the blanks!

38:48.827 --> 38:49.994
(screams):
No!

38:50.027 --> 38:51.362
No!

38:51.396 --> 38:53.465
But what did I expect
from a screw-up like you?

38:53.498 --> 38:56.001
I didn't... Pete...

38:56.034 --> 38:58.335
You're nothing
but a waste of space.

38:58.369 --> 38:59.570
No!

39:07.045 --> 39:08.380
(both scream)

39:28.266 --> 39:30.635
Oh, God.

39:34.806 --> 39:36.240
(Pete growling)

39:41.112 --> 39:42.414
Where's the gun?

39:43.280 --> 39:45.250
Where's the gun?!

39:45.282 --> 39:47.385
Get off her!

39:47.418 --> 39:49.353
Get the gun!
Get the gun!

39:49.387 --> 39:50.889
Hurry!

39:52.157 --> 39:53.358
(grunts)

39:53.391 --> 39:55.393
(whimpering)

39:58.996 --> 39:59.965
All the same.

39:59.998 --> 40:01.900
You're all the same.

40:08.907 --> 40:11.141
(both growling)

41:11.369 --> 41:13.137
Buffy?

41:26.050 --> 41:27.351
Buffy.

41:48.539 --> 41:50.041
It's all over school.

41:50.074 --> 41:51.976
What happened
with Debbie and Pete.

41:52.010 --> 41:54.411
Except for the "Pete
was a monster" part.

41:54.445 --> 41:56.014
Yeah, a freshman
told me that Pete

41:56.047 --> 41:58.650
had eight iced cafe
mochas and just lost it.

41:58.684 --> 42:00.652
That's better
than the estrogen theory.

42:00.686 --> 42:03.021
I heard he took all of his
mother's birth-control pills.

42:03.054 --> 42:05.023
He didn't?
Pete was a monster?

42:05.056 --> 42:06.925
Where have I been?

42:06.958 --> 42:09.661
In your special place, Cor,
which is why I adore you.

42:09.695 --> 42:11.096
So what's the true story?

42:11.128 --> 42:13.030
What happened?

42:13.063 --> 42:15.500
We got a hold of Pete's
lab books and stuff,

42:15.532 --> 42:18.402
and Mr. Science was doing
a Jekyll/Hyde deal.

42:18.436 --> 42:20.170
He was afraid Debbie
was gonna leave him,

42:20.204 --> 42:24.509
so he mixed this potion
to become super mas macho.

42:24.541 --> 42:26.244
The only thing was,
after a while,

42:26.277 --> 42:28.545
he didn't need the potion
to turn into a bad guy.

42:28.579 --> 42:30.181
He did it just fine
on his own.

42:30.215 --> 42:31.682
So it was like a real killing.

42:31.717 --> 42:33.751
He wasn't under
the influence of anything?

42:33.784 --> 42:35.753
Just himself.

42:35.786 --> 42:37.222
Uh...

42:38.789 --> 42:41.559
I'll see you guys later.

42:41.592 --> 42:45.130
Great, now I'm gonna be stuck
with serious thoughts all day.

42:56.007 --> 42:58.909
I don't know what
to say that's...

42:58.943 --> 43:01.679
not gonna sound
stupid or obvious.

43:05.150 --> 43:06.550
I've been friends
with them both

43:06.583 --> 43:09.286
since before
we started school.

43:09.320 --> 43:12.090
Is there anything I can do?

43:15.025 --> 43:17.228
Thanks.
I'm gonna be okay.

43:17.262 --> 43:19.563
It's just that you
never really know

43:19.597 --> 43:22.567
what's going on
inside somebody.

43:22.599 --> 43:23.902
Do you?

43:23.934 --> 43:25.503
I mean, you think

43:25.536 --> 43:28.940
if you care about them...

43:28.974 --> 43:32.309
But you never really do.

43:38.483 --> 43:40.284
BUFFY:
 "Night came on,

43:40.318 --> 43:43.621
"and a full moon rose
 high over the trees,

43:43.655 --> 43:46.623
"lighting the land till it
 lay bathed in ghostly day.

43:46.657 --> 43:48.927
"And the strain
 of the primitive

43:48.960 --> 43:52.163
"remained alive and active.

43:52.197 --> 43:54.532
"Faithfulness and devotion,

43:54.565 --> 43:58.635
"things born of fire
 and roof were his,

43:58.670 --> 44:02.440
"yet he retained his wildness
 and wiliness.

44:02.472 --> 44:05.643
"And from the depths
 of the forest,

44:05.677 --> 44:08.079
a call still sounded."

44:48.853 --> 44:51.289
Grr. Argh.
