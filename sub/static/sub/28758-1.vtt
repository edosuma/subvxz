Sole? Sole?

01:51.679 --> 01:53.779
After I go
see Professor Kanem.

01:58.252 --> 01:59.318
Kanem?

02:06.360 --> 02:08.660
It reads like a novel,
Professor Kanem.

02:08.662 --> 02:10.128
Call me, Helene.

02:10.131 --> 02:11.363
Okay.

02:11.365 --> 02:13.298
I want-- just one second.

02:14.802 --> 02:18.904
You know I went to the village
and we had goat and chicken

02:18.906 --> 02:21.373
and they are so excited for me

02:21.375 --> 02:23.242
to bring folks to Sierra Leon.

02:23.244 --> 02:25.477
Since we met,

02:25.479 --> 02:27.312
that's the only thing
I can think about.

02:28.182 --> 02:29.481
How's your father doing?

02:30.885 --> 02:34.553
Um, I mean,
he's in a lot of pain,

02:34.555 --> 02:37.656
but that's expected
at this stage, so.

02:43.330 --> 02:46.632
Sole, you know I really

02:46.634 --> 02:48.934
want you to
go on this trip, right?

02:48.936 --> 02:52.171
You know, I, I really do.
But there will be other trips

02:52.173 --> 02:53.906
if you're not
able to make this one.

02:53.908 --> 03:02.214
- Sweetie, I just, I don't want you to regret taking the trip.
- Oh, I wouldn't.

03:02.216 --> 03:06.919
Why, why would I regret going to
Sierra Leon with you?

03:06.921 --> 03:10.422
I just don't want anything
distracting you from your father.

03:10.424 --> 03:14.693
But I've already taken a
year off to focus on him.

03:14.695 --> 03:17.963
And you don't know how much
longer you'll have with him.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.733
See there,
you kissed your teeth.

03:21.735 --> 03:24.269
I should never have taught you
how to kiss your teeth.

03:29.810 --> 03:34.213
He, he would want me to
take this trip with you.

03:36.951 --> 03:38.784
Did you ask him if I
could go to Sierra Leone

03:38.786 --> 03:40.652
with Dr. Kanem?

03:40.654 --> 03:43.388
He's still
not responsive, honey.

04:43.984 --> 04:47.286
Being with her, being with
your family, being in a different place

04:47.288 --> 04:49.288
may be the best thing
for you right now.

04:49.290 --> 04:51.957
What was I thinking? I should've
planned for this better.

04:51.959 --> 04:55.627
You know, you may like it, and before
you know it, you'll be back in New York

04:55.629 --> 04:57.996
starting your freshman year.
You'll be right back here.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.898
I can get her
to sign me over to you.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.434
- If I do that then--
- Sole, sweetie.

05:02.436 --> 05:04.469
Why is he sending me
to live with someone

05:04.471 --> 05:06.471
- I've never even met before?
- She's your grandmother.

05:06.473 --> 05:09.941
She's your family, and you
need to be with her right now.

05:09.943 --> 05:11.610
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.453
Tada, darling!

05:54.455 --> 05:56.621
Welcome to your new home.
What do you think?

05:56.623 --> 06:00.826
I know it's, uh, not quite
the same as New York,

06:00.828 --> 06:03.628
but uh, you're gonna love it.

06:25.619 --> 06:26.985
What is that?

06:26.987 --> 06:31.423
Um, it's a transfer
of guardianship.

06:31.425 --> 06:34.860
You and your husband were
really kind to take me in,

06:34.862 --> 06:36.795
but you really
didn't have to do that.

06:36.797 --> 06:38.397
I, um,

06:38.399 --> 06:40.465
yeah, actually
my professor, uh--

06:40.467 --> 06:42.067
Husband?

06:42.069 --> 06:45.036
Aw, god bless your heart.

06:45.038 --> 06:47.606
Pastor Davis and I are very

06:49.676 --> 06:50.842
close and loving friends.

06:50.844 --> 06:53.845
Oh, okay.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.847
Look at that skin.

06:57.017 --> 06:59.785
- Now what foundation are you wearing?
- I'm not wearing any makeup.

06:59.787 --> 07:05.524
Oh my, I could never leave
the house without my face.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.762
Arm, please, yeah, I--

07:11.732 --> 07:13.832
Painless, I need your opinion.

07:15.669 --> 07:18.503
There's this, hm?

07:19.206 --> 07:22.541
I'm probably not
the best person to ask.

07:22.543 --> 07:25.043
Um, so yeah, do you mind

07:25.045 --> 07:27.546
signing over
guardianship to Helene--

07:27.548 --> 07:30.749
- You don't wanna live with me?
- Well, it's not that.

07:30.751 --> 07:33.685
It's just
I thought after daddy passed

07:33.687 --> 07:35.454
that naturally
I'd stay with Helene,

07:35.456 --> 07:36.922
because she's actually
gonna be professor

07:36.924 --> 07:38.990
- this fall, so it just--
- Darling.

07:38.992 --> 07:41.493
You need to be with family,

07:41.495 --> 07:44.763
not a professor
at times like this.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.765
- No.
- She's not just my professor.

07:46.767 --> 07:51.670
She's... my best friend, so um--

07:51.672 --> 07:53.672
Your best friend
is your professor?

07:56.610 --> 07:59.611
Well I, I know,
I don't know you,

07:59.613 --> 08:01.480
but I wanna get to know you.

08:01.482 --> 08:04.082
We, we can still
get to know each other.

08:04.084 --> 08:07.152
It's just that, it's, just
we've been planning this trip

08:07.154 --> 08:10.622
for like, most of the year
and the timing isn't--

08:10.624 --> 08:14.192
I'm sorry, Sole, but I'm not turning
you over to someone I don't know.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.862
Daddy knew her.

08:16.864 --> 08:19.130
- She's not a stranger.
- Yeah, and he chose me.

08:22.769 --> 08:25.837
Look, we'll have fun here,
you'll see.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.087
Darling?

08:47.728 --> 08:49.895
In this house
we don't lock doors.

08:51.932 --> 08:54.299
I want you to come and
meet some of my friends.

08:55.702 --> 08:56.902
Okay.

08:56.904 --> 08:59.971
Oh, why not a dress?

09:01.909 --> 09:06.745
Well, the only dress I have is
the one I wore to the funeral, so.

09:06.747 --> 09:09.047
Oh, well we have to
have a shopping spree.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.216
Alright, hurry.

09:31.705 --> 09:32.671
Just right.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.640
- Hi, girls.
- Hi.

09:35.642 --> 09:38.710
Granddaughter! Hi.

09:38.712 --> 09:40.946
I'm Nance.
This is my daughter, Gilda.

09:40.948 --> 09:43.915
Hi Sole. This must be super
different from New York, huh?

09:45.819 --> 09:48.253
Oh, Pastor Davis
is already inside.

09:48.255 --> 09:51.122
We've been discussing the
renovations for the church.

09:51.124 --> 09:54.826
Oh, okay. Yeah.

09:54.828 --> 09:57.963
- Lord, help me to pray for her.
- Hey, neighbor.

09:59.366 --> 10:02.267
Don't engage with that girl.

10:02.269 --> 10:06.037
You don't wanna talk today?
No, no, no, seriously,

10:06.039 --> 10:08.340
- I think you have something to say. What was that?
- Let's just go inside.

10:08.342 --> 10:10.875
You'd think she could have
more respect for Tanya's house.

10:10.877 --> 10:14.212
- Who's Tanya?
- Her grandmother. Rest her soul.

10:14.214 --> 10:18.383
But I know that Tanya did not leave her
that house for that girl to destroy.

10:18.385 --> 10:20.952
- Where's her mother?
- None of us know.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.622
I just don't know what she's gonna
do when that life insurance money runs out.

10:23.624 --> 10:25.123
There's some girls
in our youth group,

10:25.125 --> 10:27.092
they would love
to take you shopping.

10:30.964 --> 10:35.800
So Sole,
so Sole, what was it like

10:35.802 --> 10:40.872
- meeting your grandmother for the first time?
- It was fine.

10:40.874 --> 10:43.675
Well I discovered
that Miss Sole here

10:43.677 --> 10:48.013
is exceptionally smart and
would've started college at 16,

10:48.015 --> 10:50.682
but she took a year
off because of her father.

10:50.684 --> 10:52.984
Irene tells me
that you're interested

10:52.986 --> 10:56.388
in helping children in Africa.

10:56.390 --> 11:00.725
I wanna help children
that have been affected by war.

11:00.727 --> 11:06.064
Um, Dr. Helene Kanem, she's actually gonna
be my professor this fall at Columbia,

11:06.066 --> 11:10.268
and working with her will
pretty much automatically put me

11:10.270 --> 11:14.873
in the top 10% of candidates
to volunteer at the UN, so.

11:19.813 --> 11:24.182
You know, we have decided
to join our sister congregation

11:24.184 --> 11:25.750
in their missionary trip.

11:25.752 --> 11:27.986
We are gonna be
fundraising together,

11:27.988 --> 11:33.725
and on your 18th
birthday we are going to

11:33.727 --> 11:36.294
- West Africa!
- West Africa!

11:41.101 --> 11:45.003
We can do a walk-a-thon
for the missionary trip.

11:45.005 --> 11:47.872
Exercising and
raising money at the same time.

11:53.113 --> 11:56.081
Oh, well sweetheart
must be so excited

11:56.083 --> 11:58.750
that she hasn't
touched a thing on her plate.

11:58.752 --> 12:00.719
I'm vegan.

12:00.721 --> 12:05.724
Oh, now our girlfriend
Louise did that diet, right,

12:05.726 --> 12:08.226
and she what,
she lost about 30 pounds

12:08.228 --> 12:09.461
or something like that.

12:09.463 --> 12:11.730
Darling,
how much weight have you lost?

12:39.259 --> 12:41.259
I'm getting ready to
get after it, and this is gonna be

12:41.261 --> 12:43.027
cardio-intensive, you guys.

12:43.029 --> 12:44.496
- Here we go.
- Legs are gonna be burning.

12:44.498 --> 12:46.965
Heart rates are gonna be up.

12:46.967 --> 12:50.435
You're doing great. Next we're gonna
go with a forward and backward hop.

13:01.014 --> 13:01.980
<i> $800?</i>

13:25.438 --> 13:29.073
- Just stay.
- No, fuck you!

13:29.075 --> 13:34.379
It's just, just stay.
Why, I can't, I can't.

13:34.381 --> 13:37.849
- I haven't slept for two days, just let me let-- don't leave.
- Jasmine, just go to sleep.

13:37.851 --> 13:38.850
- Don't leave
- Oh my God.

13:40.387 --> 13:41.920
Just stay, please.

13:41.922 --> 13:43.922
Are you fucking gonna leave?

13:43.924 --> 13:46.024
You're gonna fucking leave?

13:46.026 --> 13:48.092
- Jasmine.
- Then fucking go, then go!

13:49.296 --> 13:50.461
Go, fuck you!

14:35.976 --> 14:39.611
I'm just never gonna get to
know her or anything. It's terrible!

14:39.613 --> 14:41.913
Here, give me your glass,
give me your glass.

14:41.915 --> 14:43.014
Oh, thank you.

14:43.016 --> 14:45.183
You'll get to know her.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.121
Whoa, and I'll get that,
don't you worry.

14:50.123 --> 14:52.023
I got it, I got it.

14:53.126 --> 14:54.559
Would you stop?

14:56.596 --> 14:58.129
Would you stop?

14:58.131 --> 14:59.631
- What is wrong with you?
- Look, you've got to

14:59.633 --> 15:01.599
- remember this.
- What?

15:02.669 --> 15:05.503
Irene, she's not Pearl,

15:05.505 --> 15:08.172
and you're not
who you used to be.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.478
Knowing that the
same kinds of suffering

15:13.480 --> 15:15.613
are being experienced
by your brotherhood

15:15.615 --> 15:17.115
throughout the world.

15:17.117 --> 15:20.218
And after you have
suffered a little while,

15:20.220 --> 15:22.186
the God of all grace
who has called you

15:22.188 --> 15:24.222
to His eternal glory in Christ

15:24.224 --> 15:25.957
will himself restore, confirm,

15:25.959 --> 15:27.558
strengthen, and establish you.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.394
First Peter 5, 9-10.

15:32.032 --> 15:34.132
Why don't we take a break?

15:45.278 --> 15:46.611
How did it go this morning?

15:46.613 --> 15:49.347
We had a very
interesting discussion.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.317
It was about faith.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.086
I don't understand
how she doesn't believe

15:55.088 --> 15:56.354
there's anything out there.

15:56.356 --> 15:57.622
I mean, no God?

15:57.624 --> 15:59.223
Sole.

15:59.225 --> 16:01.292
Father, why don't you
give us a minute?

16:03.263 --> 16:06.531
Would you please stop telling
people you don't believe in God?

16:06.533 --> 16:11.336
- In my family, we believe in God.
- I'm an atheist.

16:11.338 --> 16:14.205
Well you wanna do all those
things for people in Africa.

16:14.207 --> 16:19.210
Missionary trips are actually
against everything I believe in.

16:19.212 --> 16:22.647
Pastor, would you please tell me what 17-year-old
really knows what they wanna believe in.

16:22.649 --> 16:27.251
Many 17-year-olds are responsible for changing
society based on things they believe in.

16:27.253 --> 16:31.122
Dr. Kanem even says society needs
to tune into the youth more,

16:31.124 --> 16:34.225
- and that's why if you--
- I could care less about what that professor of yours

16:34.227 --> 16:35.693
has to say about anything.

16:35.695 --> 16:39.364
Okay, ladies, I think that your,

16:40.200 --> 16:42.567
your grandmother
is just recalling

16:42.569 --> 16:47.238
a similar discussion she
had with your mother years ago.

16:48.074 --> 16:51.776
Sweetheart, it's wonderful

16:51.778 --> 16:55.046
that you found
something to believe in,

16:55.048 --> 16:58.716
but I just wanna make sure that
you believe in what's right.

17:01.755 --> 17:04.222
How is she so much like her?

17:04.223 --> 17:07.325
We have breakfast,
she won't talk.

17:08.627 --> 17:10.627
We have lunch, she won't talk.

17:11.598 --> 17:15.532
All I want is just to
have my life, that's all,

17:15.535 --> 17:17.769
but here she comes,
Pearl number two,

17:17.771 --> 17:21.039
just stirring up trouble
just like her mother but fatter.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.339
Irene.

17:22.342 --> 17:23.775
- What?
- No.

17:23.777 --> 17:28.179
Now you know the Lord never puts
more on us than we can bear.

17:28.181 --> 17:30.548
Well I can't bear this, Clay,
I can't do it.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.218
- Come on.
- Huh?

17:34.220 --> 17:35.186
- Come on.
- Alright.

17:35.188 --> 17:36.554
- Okay?
- Mm-hm.

17:41.828 --> 17:47.198
- Could you make me another martini, darling?
- Yeah.

18:30.376 --> 18:31.809
Who are you?

18:31.811 --> 18:36.147
- Hi, I'm from next door, I--
- Really, Erica?

18:36.149 --> 18:37.815
Just because I fucked
somebody else last week.

19:08.548 --> 19:09.814
Is he okay?

19:09.816 --> 19:14.819
Yeah, he's just meditating away
his fucked up father.

19:15.822 --> 19:18.256
He hasn't even noticed I
haven't been home this whole week.

19:18.258 --> 19:20.525
You can stay here
with me as long as you want.

19:23.463 --> 19:24.829
Nicotine?

19:24.831 --> 19:27.365
Nicotine is a drug too.

19:27.367 --> 19:28.666
What is that?

19:28.668 --> 19:30.168
It's weed.

19:30.170 --> 19:31.536
People don't die from weed.

19:32.872 --> 19:34.705
Are you going
over to Suzy's house?

19:34.707 --> 19:36.574
You know, fucking her isn't
gonna make you feel better.

19:36.576 --> 19:37.909
You know that, right?

19:37.911 --> 19:39.177
Are you really leaving?

19:39.179 --> 19:40.678
Look, you can fucking smoke!

19:40.680 --> 19:42.847
Why are you leaving?
Just stay, chill, just stay.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.315
- Wait, wait.
- No.

19:46.686 --> 19:47.718
What's your name?

19:49.289 --> 19:50.254
Guedado.

19:50.890 --> 19:51.923
Hey, Guedado.

19:52.759 --> 19:54.759
Um, hi, I'm Sole.

19:55.595 --> 19:57.962
And actually
I need your help with--

19:57.964 --> 20:01.699
- Both of you, I need your help with something.
- With what?

20:01.701 --> 20:04.302
Okay, this is gonna
sound a little weird,

20:04.304 --> 20:06.270
but I need to form a group.

20:06.272 --> 20:08.506
I'm trying to get
this scholarship thing

20:08.508 --> 20:09.840
so I can get back to New York.

20:09.842 --> 20:12.743
- It's due in a few days and--
- New York?

20:12.745 --> 20:15.913
- I'm already in a band.
- Is that where you're from?

20:15.915 --> 20:18.583
Uh, yeah, um,
it's, it's not a band.

20:18.585 --> 20:22.987
It's, it's more like a
protest performance group.

20:22.989 --> 20:25.890
- Have you heard of Pussy Riot?
- Yeah.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.359
Yeah, so you would
get to protest

20:28.361 --> 20:30.795
against anything
that pisses you off,

20:30.797 --> 20:35.433
child soldiers, girls getting raped
in wars, uh, environmental issues,

20:35.435 --> 20:39.470
capitalism, uh,
Christianity, just any--

20:39.472 --> 20:41.872
- What's wrong with Christianity?
- You know what?

20:41.874 --> 20:45.243
I would like to protest
DJs who don't call you back

20:45.245 --> 20:48.012
when you ask to be
one of their tour dancers.

20:48.014 --> 20:49.313
Wow.

20:49.315 --> 20:50.281
Okay.

20:50.283 --> 20:55.486
Sure, but we'd have to
politically contextualize that

20:55.488 --> 20:58.689
so it doesn't sound so PMS-y.

21:00.326 --> 21:02.927
Oh my god,
I would do whatever you want,

21:02.929 --> 21:05.029
if we can call ourselves PMS-y.

21:05.031 --> 21:06.831
PMS-y?

21:06.833 --> 21:07.798
PMS.

21:09.535 --> 21:11.636
It's kind of feminist.

21:13.873 --> 21:14.939
Okay, fine.

21:16.809 --> 21:17.842
Let's celebrate.

21:19.345 --> 21:22.580
- Wait, but, we haven't done anything yet.
- Yeah.

21:22.582 --> 21:26.350

Los Angeles, what's up?

22:22.909 --> 22:25.509
Yo, I got great news.

22:25.511 --> 22:28.679
So, my band just went
on European tour today,

22:28.681 --> 22:29.814
Picked a great group of

22:29.816 --> 22:31.682
backup dancers to go with us.

22:31.684 --> 22:33.851
Mya, Tima and Neveen.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.453
Give it up,
give it up, give it up!

23:38.918 --> 23:39.884
Step.

23:42.955 --> 23:44.155
Oh God.

23:44.157 --> 23:45.122
Okay, one second.

23:49.095 --> 23:50.928
Alright, here you go.

23:50.930 --> 23:53.431
Can you just stay?

23:53.433 --> 23:56.567
- It's almost 5:00 a.m.
- It's, it's okay.

23:56.569 --> 23:58.536
You probably have other things
to do than hang out with me.

23:58.538 --> 24:00.971
No, I just, I can't get caught.

24:00.973 --> 24:03.774
You can sleep well, it's fine.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.643
Ow!

24:17.790 --> 24:20.558
Are you like serious
about this PMS thing?

24:21.928 --> 24:23.994
Yeah, pretty serious.

24:34.574 --> 24:37.541
You know,
your girlfriend's dumb.

24:37.543 --> 24:40.077
She's not my girlfriend anymore.

24:41.614 --> 24:44.648
- And she's dumb.
- Okay.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.183
What's your story
with witch next door?

24:46.185 --> 24:47.985
Is that like your
grandmother or something?

24:47.987 --> 24:49.820
She is my mom's mother,

24:49.822 --> 24:52.156
but she disowned my mom.

24:52.158 --> 24:53.924
My mom died in childbirth,

24:53.926 --> 24:55.759
and my dad recently died.

24:55.761 --> 24:57.761
Um, and since
I'm not 18, they...

24:57.763 --> 25:00.030
- Death, death.
- ...sent me to live with

25:00.032 --> 25:01.198
- my last living relative.
- Death.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.800
And that's her, so.

25:02.802 --> 25:04.702
Fuck life.

25:05.571 --> 25:07.071
Here.

25:07.073 --> 25:08.906
Why don't we get you to bed?

25:08.908 --> 25:11.242
No, no. I don't wanna sleep.

25:13.112 --> 25:16.280
I just,
I'll go get you some water.

25:16.282 --> 25:18.048
Will you just lay
with me for a little bit?

25:18.050 --> 25:20.184
Please, I won't
try anything, I swear.

25:42.241 --> 25:43.207
Stop!

25:44.610 --> 25:47.645
Look, I'll stay for a
little while longer, okay?

25:56.122 --> 25:58.923
Can't be a dancer with these.

26:02.628 --> 26:04.695
You can for PMS.

26:07.166 --> 26:08.299
Doesn't it hurt?

26:12.905 --> 26:14.905
It feels good at first.

26:14.907 --> 26:15.906
Just like sex.

26:25.885 --> 26:27.284
Thanks for looking after her.

26:36.963 --> 26:38.862
What else makes you feel better?

26:39.966 --> 26:42.766
Jack Daniels,
but you took that away from me.

26:46.806 --> 26:48.372
And dancing.

27:06.125 --> 27:09.226
<i> One of Africa's most vicious civil wars</i>

27:09.228 --> 27:12.796
<i>has burst open. The fighters
are often young orphans,</i>

27:12.798 --> 27:14.798
<i>like this 12-year-old boy.</i>

27:14.800 --> 27:17.267
<i>He's fighting to revenge
the death of his father.</i>

27:23.676 --> 27:24.942
<i>Dissidents are silenced.</i>

27:26.712 --> 27:29.747
<i>But people are still
finding ways to protest.</i>

27:38.858 --> 27:41.291
<i>Street art has gone viral.</i>

27:41.293 --> 27:43.427
<i>This whole procession
is long overdue,</i>

27:43.429 --> 27:46.363
<i>because this thing has
been happening for long.</i>

29:27.833 --> 29:30.200
<i>Please leave your message.</i>

29:48.387 --> 29:52.322
What were you doing?
I called you like three times.

29:52.324 --> 29:53.423
Why are you so late?

29:59.064 --> 30:00.197
What are you gonna be doing?

30:00.199 --> 30:05.002
I don't know how to sing
or dance or play an instrument,

30:05.004 --> 30:07.471
so you guys are my only hope.

30:15.080 --> 30:16.046
Come on.

30:19.318 --> 30:21.318
Just let the music
tell you what to do.

30:21.320 --> 30:22.419
Hey, Jazz, come on.

30:24.423 --> 30:26.156
Draw.

30:28.127 --> 30:28.992
I don't--

30:28.994 --> 30:29.960
Draw.

30:36.902 --> 30:38.035
Stop being awkward.

30:38.037 --> 30:39.002
Just draw.

31:14.874 --> 31:16.306
Are those severed limbs?

31:18.310 --> 31:20.310
I see a face
in there too, you know.

31:20.312 --> 31:23.080
This isn't some dumb
art school application.

31:23.082 --> 31:26.984
It has to relate
specifically to my praxis essay.

31:26.986 --> 31:29.152
Praxis? Practice you mean?

31:29.154 --> 31:33.490
Praxis. It's when you
connect an intellectual idea

31:33.492 --> 31:35.158
with on-the-ground service.

31:35.160 --> 31:37.160
For example, okay,
Walter Rodney, he's--

31:37.162 --> 31:38.095
I don't get it.

31:38.998 --> 31:41.331
PMS has to relate specifically

31:41.333 --> 31:43.634
to issues going
on in this community.

31:44.536 --> 31:46.670
Like what, child soldiers
in Ladera Heights?

31:46.672 --> 31:49.039
No, we have to raise awareness,

31:49.041 --> 31:52.042
connect the, you know, the
violence that people our age

31:52.044 --> 31:54.912
deal with over here with the
stuff that's going on over there.

31:54.914 --> 31:56.546
Why does it matter to you?

31:56.548 --> 31:58.649
How can you not care?

31:58.651 --> 32:01.318
They have both of their
parents taken away from them.

32:01.320 --> 32:03.253
That's how it happens.

32:03.255 --> 32:04.955
Like you,

32:04.957 --> 32:07.057
all three of us,

32:07.059 --> 32:09.693
death has kissed our lives.

32:09.695 --> 32:11.094
We're a motherless trio.

32:16.702 --> 32:21.271
<i>So, you are an organizer
with people your own age,</i>

32:21.273 --> 32:25.709
<i>but you are making music
and art and hanging out?</i>

32:25.711 --> 32:28.011
<i>California has transformed you.</i>

32:28.013 --> 32:29.680
<i>I, I don't,
I don't recognize you.</i>

32:29.682 --> 32:32.516
<i>- This is amazing.</i>
- I can't stay here.

32:32.518 --> 32:34.084
I'm coming back to New York.

32:34.086 --> 32:36.553
<i>New York's here.
New York's been here.</i>

32:36.555 --> 32:39.356
<i>I'll be here.</i>

32:44.663 --> 32:46.630
Alright girls, keep it moving.

32:46.632 --> 32:47.497
Woo!

32:47.499 --> 32:48.498
Yeah.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.167
Woo!

32:50.169 --> 32:51.335
No texting.

32:53.172 --> 32:54.705
Your professor friend can wait.

32:59.311 --> 33:06.450
Oh, now Keena and, um,
Martha have to head back, right?

33:06.452 --> 33:07.985
They have to
take care of some business.

33:07.987 --> 33:09.486
Can I hang out with you guys?

33:11.457 --> 33:14.992
Oh, well,
if you're gonna do that,

33:14.994 --> 33:16.626
here's a credit card,

33:16.628 --> 33:18.528
just in case you
wanna go shopping.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.700
I'm feeling a
little lightheaded,

33:23.702 --> 33:26.636
so um, I think I'm gonna stay
back and grab something to eat.

33:26.638 --> 33:29.206
Did you really wanna hang out
with us or did you just say that?

33:29.208 --> 33:31.274
- Well--
- It's okay, we won't tell.

33:31.276 --> 33:35.212
I appreciate that. I just,
I need to study for something.

33:35.214 --> 33:36.646
- Study?
- College prep stuff.

33:36.648 --> 33:39.282
Yo! Hey!

33:39.284 --> 33:40.617
I've been texting you.

33:40.619 --> 33:42.152
Where were you?

33:42.154 --> 33:43.620
Oh.

33:44.456 --> 33:47.457
Hanging out with these
fine young Christians, wow.

33:47.459 --> 33:49.426
Nice getup girls.

33:49.428 --> 33:51.261
Super bright and, yeah.

33:51.263 --> 33:53.030
- Um, okay, so I--
- Come on.

33:53.032 --> 33:55.532
I just need to
study for something.

33:57.569 --> 33:59.403
Okay then, fuck you too then.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.806
You have a fucking
great day, girls.

34:02.808 --> 34:03.707
She's crazy, you know.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.609
No, like crazy.

34:19.625 --> 34:23.560
Um, sorry, I just
didn't want them to tell Irene.

34:23.562 --> 34:26.228
- Whatever.
- Well, I'm here now, so.

34:26.231 --> 34:28.697
- I'm not doing your stupid PMS.
- Why are you so angry?

34:28.699 --> 34:31.333
No, stop talking, stop talking!
That was some fake shit and you know it!

34:31.335 --> 34:33.370
- Let's go, let's go. -You know it, continue...
- What are you talking about?

34:36.842 --> 34:39.376
<i> Shut the fuck up.</i>

34:40.545 --> 34:43.547
Stop,
I'm sick of this shit.

34:43.549 --> 34:45.482
Lefa and I.

34:45.484 --> 34:46.449
Stop.

34:56.195 --> 34:57.494
I wish my dad was dead.

35:02.101 --> 35:03.200
It's okay, it's true.

35:03.202 --> 35:04.201
Except it's not.

35:06.105 --> 35:07.838
You ever wonder
what it would be like

35:07.840 --> 35:09.639
if your mom was still alive.

35:09.641 --> 35:12.809
I don't think it's
productive to think like that.

35:13.745 --> 35:14.711
Why not?

35:15.714 --> 35:17.881
Because it doesn't help anyone.

35:19.451 --> 35:21.485
You would definitely not be here

35:21.487 --> 35:22.786
if your dad didn't die.

35:22.788 --> 35:24.855
Okay, um, can we go now?

35:26.358 --> 35:27.557
I need to use the bathroom.

35:27.559 --> 35:28.525
Piss or poop?

35:30.195 --> 35:32.362
Number one, but...

35:32.364 --> 35:33.697
Look, we should
probably get going anyway.

35:33.699 --> 35:36.266
We needed to get started
on the PMS stuff, right?

35:36.268 --> 35:37.901
No, yeah, we definitely do.

35:40.572 --> 35:43.840
- Don't you need to pee?
- Oh.

35:46.845 --> 35:49.179
You never had a boyfriend?

35:49.181 --> 35:50.147
No.

35:52.751 --> 35:56.219
You just gotta shake it off.

35:56.221 --> 35:58.588
Like this, shake it.

35:58.590 --> 36:02.259
- Shake it, shake it.
- I just got some on my leg.

36:02.261 --> 36:03.460
Who cares, it's just pee.

36:08.667 --> 36:11.501
Ever had a girlfriend?

36:11.503 --> 36:12.469
No.

36:12.471 --> 36:15.872
I bet you've
never even been kissed.

36:15.874 --> 36:19.509
You kissed me,
the other night at the party.

36:19.511 --> 36:20.477
I did?

36:22.281 --> 36:23.547
Yeah.

36:23.549 --> 36:25.448
Well that doesn't count.

36:25.450 --> 36:26.950
You can thank
your dad for dying,

36:26.952 --> 36:30.887
because you are
gonna kiss Guedado.

36:30.889 --> 36:32.289
Stop.

36:32.291 --> 36:33.423
You are!

36:33.425 --> 36:34.791
It's gonna happen soon!

36:41.900 --> 36:44.501
I want your soul, Sole.

36:46.371 --> 36:51.308
- I don't wanna wear a mask.
- Um, what?

36:51.310 --> 36:55.478
Why am I protesting
and all I wanna do is dance.

36:55.480 --> 36:57.614
Um, but you are dancing.

36:57.616 --> 36:59.816
No, I'm dancing in something
that only benefits you.

36:59.818 --> 37:01.218
Oy, Jasmine.

37:01.220 --> 37:05.956
- This means a lot to her. Look.
- Oh my god, put that back.

37:05.958 --> 37:08.558
Put it back, what are you doing?

37:10.996 --> 37:12.629
Oh my god.

37:12.631 --> 37:17.000
- Maybe it'll help with your...
- My what?

37:17.002 --> 37:20.370
You know, you said
dancing makes you feel good.

37:20.372 --> 37:21.638
Come on, Jazz.

37:22.941 --> 37:25.642
Alright, let's just try it
at the church tomorrow.

37:25.644 --> 37:29.546
Really? Okay, um,
I promise it'll be fun.

37:29.548 --> 37:31.381
I always have fun.

37:40.259 --> 37:41.491
Just a kiss goodbye.

37:42.894 --> 37:45.662
Would you, a little one?

37:46.765 --> 37:47.797
Little one.

37:54.406 --> 37:56.640
I'll do whatever you say.

37:56.642 --> 37:57.674
Yeah.

37:57.676 --> 37:58.908
Oh I'd like to see the day.

37:58.910 --> 38:00.410
Oh shut up and kiss me.

38:08.453 --> 38:11.421
- You tease me, that's not fair!
- I'm out.

38:11.423 --> 38:12.422
Catch you later.

38:14.593 --> 38:17.727
Clay,
I won't do anything.

38:17.729 --> 38:21.031
I miss you when
you're gone, please.

38:23.035 --> 38:24.734
That was too easy.

38:24.736 --> 38:26.336
You know I'm easy.

38:26.338 --> 38:29.306
No, you know I'm easy.

38:29.308 --> 38:32.942
I've-- hands to myself.

38:34.479 --> 38:35.779
Honestly.

38:36.882 --> 38:38.848
Oh-ho!

38:38.850 --> 38:39.983
Technical.

38:39.985 --> 38:43.353
I promise I won't do anything.

38:43.355 --> 38:45.455
I miss you when
you're gone, please.

38:46.792 --> 38:49.059
You're so cute.

39:09.114 --> 39:11.047
Just makes my day go better.

39:12.050 --> 39:14.050
It's all gonna work.

39:14.052 --> 39:15.952
It's all gonna work.

39:15.954 --> 39:17.087
- It's working.
- It's working.

39:35.841 --> 39:38.675
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!

39:43.415 --> 39:45.582
Did we make too much noise?

39:45.584 --> 39:47.117
Oh, oh yeah.

39:47.119 --> 39:48.084
Did I?

40:13.011 --> 40:16.713
<i> What the fuck is up?</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

40:16.715 --> 40:17.881
Where's Jasmine?

40:17.883 --> 40:22.485
She's, she's not picking up her
phone, and she's not at home.

40:22.487 --> 40:24.854
You just wanna do this
another day or what?

40:25.857 --> 40:26.856
No.

40:26.858 --> 40:27.857
You sure?

40:27.859 --> 40:28.825
Yes!

40:48.947 --> 40:50.713
Turn around.

40:50.715 --> 40:51.915
Turn around.

40:59.891 --> 41:04.461
- Right there. Okay.
- No, ah.

41:04.463 --> 41:05.595
Put this one instead.

41:05.597 --> 41:07.997
- Good?
- Okay.

41:09.968 --> 41:13.870
- That right?
- No, it's spinning around, it's the--

41:13.872 --> 41:17.006
- Orange.
- I don't know, this isn't...

41:19.010 --> 41:21.044
Just forget about it.
It's not, it's not working.

41:21.046 --> 41:25.648
No, it's fine, look,
alright. It's alright. Yeah?

41:26.651 --> 41:28.651
Hold your pen, it's fine.

41:32.924 --> 41:34.958
Would you fix
your shirt at least.

41:34.960 --> 41:37.227
- Baby I --
- No, no, no, fix your tie.

41:39.898 --> 41:42.131
So, why was I here then?

41:42.133 --> 41:44.534
Because we were up late
planning the fundraiser,

41:44.536 --> 41:46.669
and it was too dangerous for you
to go home that time of night.

41:46.671 --> 41:48.671
- You got it all figured out.
- I do.

41:53.845 --> 41:57.747
Oh, fuck baby,
you made me late, they're gone!

41:57.749 --> 41:59.716
Shit, oh shit!

42:00.752 --> 42:05.088
I'll be back for you later.
Allen and Crenshaw, okay? Come on.

42:05.090 --> 42:08.858
Allen and Crenshaw? What she
going over to Allen and Cren--

42:08.860 --> 42:12.061
- That's where my church is.
- We better get over there.

42:28.046 --> 42:29.279
Sorry, I'm sorry!

42:29.281 --> 42:30.747
My phone died, his phone died.

42:30.749 --> 42:32.248
Um, we have a cameraman, okay.

42:32.250 --> 42:35.151
Um, do, do you have my outfit?

42:35.153 --> 42:37.220
It's in the car.

42:37.222 --> 42:38.588
What's the point?

42:40.592 --> 42:42.992
See, it's good.
Fuck. It's itchy.

42:42.994 --> 42:45.094
Yeah, right he's there
and you're dancing

42:45.096 --> 42:48.865
and all of the
posters and everything.

42:58.810 --> 43:00.577
Maybe just kind of make
sure it's about the poster

43:00.579 --> 43:02.612
and turn it towards the camera.

43:04.049 --> 43:05.949
No, no, no, no, no, no!

43:10.088 --> 43:13.790
Jazz, no I don't-- you're taking
away from what we're trying to talk about!

43:13.792 --> 43:16.159
What, you said it's a
protest against whatever we wanted,

43:16.161 --> 43:18.027
so I'm protesting
against slut-shaming.

43:18.029 --> 43:19.228
- Don't,
- I know what I'm doing.

43:19.230 --> 43:20.964
It's the poster in front.

43:20.966 --> 43:23.800
- No, stop.
- It's just not-- it can't--

43:23.802 --> 43:25.201
It's not what I want.

43:25.203 --> 43:26.803
Are you getting this?

43:26.805 --> 43:29.072
Stop it, why are you doing this?

43:29.074 --> 43:30.940
It's not what it--

43:30.942 --> 43:33.876
Jasmine Thompson, what would
your grandmother say right now.

43:33.878 --> 43:36.245
- And Sole--
- Get all that mess down from my church.

43:36.247 --> 43:38.881
- Is this any way
to thank me for taking you in.

43:38.883 --> 43:41.317
Is this how your father
raised you? Oh my Lord.

43:41.319 --> 43:43.886
Clay, give my your phone,
I'm calling the police.

43:43.888 --> 43:45.989
- ...indecent
exposure -Please don't call the cops.

43:45.991 --> 43:48.658
Understand, it's plain as day.
Let us-- protesting.

43:48.660 --> 43:49.759
What are you protesting?

43:49.761 --> 43:51.828
It's for my application.

43:51.830 --> 43:53.396
I have to make a video for--

43:53.398 --> 43:55.865
- OK, I'm sorry, Irene--
- What type of education

43:55.867 --> 43:57.634
is it that your trying to get?

43:57.636 --> 43:59.669
Such embarrassing life.

43:59.671 --> 44:01.838
Clay, I'm so sorry.

44:05.910 --> 44:07.343
We are not going to talk.

44:07.345 --> 44:09.278
You see, no-- I-- You--

44:22.961 --> 44:24.661
Come on, Jasmine.

44:52.057 --> 44:53.022
It's me.

44:59.964 --> 45:03.466
- What are you doing here?
- I'm breaking you out of jail, Rapunzel, come on.

45:03.468 --> 45:05.401
It's pointless.

45:05.403 --> 45:09.038
Okay, then, I'll stay here.

45:22.420 --> 45:26.422
I'm sorry I fucked it up.

45:26.424 --> 45:27.757
I don't know
what's wrong with me,

45:27.759 --> 45:29.992
I really wanted PMS to work.

45:29.994 --> 45:31.294
No, you didn't.

45:31.296 --> 45:33.296
Yes, I did.

45:33.298 --> 45:35.965
That's like,
the most fun I've had in ages.

45:36.901 --> 45:38.801
Okay, it's late, Jasmine.

45:38.803 --> 45:41.137
- I'm tired.
- Okay, then.

45:41.139 --> 45:43.473
I'll just stay here,
keep you company.

45:43.475 --> 45:45.041
I don't need help sleeping.

45:56.387 --> 45:57.487
Your period.

46:00.191 --> 46:02.892
- Oh shit.
- What are you doing?

46:02.894 --> 46:05.461
What the heck? I'm just
trying to find underwear

46:05.463 --> 46:06.763
or a tampon or something.

46:14.773 --> 46:15.972
Thank you.

46:18.076 --> 46:20.343
What the fuck are these?

46:21.479 --> 46:25.181
You know what,
Guedado, would probably

46:25.183 --> 46:26.783
be into these granny panties.

46:26.785 --> 46:27.884
Fucking ugly.

46:30.355 --> 46:32.121
- Guedado misses you.
- Stop.

46:32.123 --> 46:34.891
You are so oblivious,
he's into you.

46:34.893 --> 46:36.893
But I'm not his type.

46:36.895 --> 46:39.061
And what is his type,
smarty pants?

46:39.063 --> 46:42.465
Guys into music like
girls who look like --

46:42.467 --> 46:45.134
- I'm calling the police.
- She just came to give me my phone.

46:45.136 --> 46:47.503
- I will not have my granddaughter spoiled by you.
- Get off me!

46:47.505 --> 46:51.174
- Get the fuck off me.
- Irene! She's my friend.

46:51.176 --> 46:54.010
I am your legal guardian. And as
long as you're under this roof,

46:54.012 --> 46:56.279
you do what I say,
and right now I say

46:56.281 --> 46:57.947
you stay away from this girl.

46:57.949 --> 47:00.082
Fine, if she goes then I go.

47:00.919 --> 47:02.552
No, you-- You come back here.

47:02.554 --> 47:04.353
Go back to Pastor Davis, I know

47:04.355 --> 47:05.855
he's waiting
for you in the room.

47:05.857 --> 47:06.556
Have sex.

47:07.892 --> 47:12.428
Oh my god, I was not expecting
it to go down like that.

47:12.430 --> 47:13.529
Like at all.

47:17.402 --> 47:19.869
- Um?
- Yeah, shut up.

47:19.871 --> 47:21.170
Shut up, I was leaving.

47:21.172 --> 47:22.972
Shut up,
I don't want to hear it.

47:23.875 --> 47:25.341
What are you doing?

47:31.082 --> 47:32.215
Pow!

47:33.518 --> 47:37.954
Oh my God,
when did you guys do this?

47:39.090 --> 47:40.189
Wow!

47:45.530 --> 47:47.029
What's this for?

47:47.031 --> 47:48.998
Mushroom tea ceremony.

47:49.000 --> 47:50.199
The feminine god.

47:51.035 --> 47:52.001
What's that?

47:53.004 --> 47:54.437
Just something we made up.

47:58.977 --> 48:03.312
To PMS, to the trio
of motherless souls.

48:05.450 --> 48:06.415
Cheers.

48:10.188 --> 48:14.557
- Okay, now what happens?
- dang.

48:14.559 --> 48:16.125
Is it gonna make me high?

48:17.262 --> 48:22.331
We are
gonna make art, okay?

48:22.333 --> 48:25.301
And we are going
to film this tonight

48:26.137 --> 48:28.471
and we are going to
make the perfect PMS video

48:28.473 --> 48:30.907
- for your application.
- Ok.

48:34.078 --> 48:36.312
I-- I don't think that --

48:46.491 --> 48:49.225
- What are you protesting?
- Death.

48:49.227 --> 48:51.360
- Oh my God.
- You can't protest death,

48:51.362 --> 48:53.195
it's inevitable.

48:53.197 --> 48:56.198
Ready?

48:56.200 --> 48:58.034
I'm ready, I been ready.

48:58.036 --> 48:59.468
What are you protesting?

49:00.338 --> 49:01.304
Life.

49:09.347 --> 49:11.347
- You feel it, huh?
- Yeah.

49:13.318 --> 49:15.217
I am the party kid.
I am the party kid.

49:21.392 --> 49:23.559
I can taste every atom.

49:25.630 --> 49:30.700
I bet if you played, I could
see your music on like--

49:36.741 --> 49:39.108
Last one, the last one.

49:41.245 --> 49:44.080
Oh.

49:45.049 --> 49:46.983
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

49:46.985 --> 49:50.619
- Come on, please.
- Come on, take it off, it feels good.

49:58.062 --> 49:59.428
Let me film you.

50:10.742 --> 50:13.075
I hated earlier today.

50:13.077 --> 50:16.045
Don't play, just wait,
I'm sorry I was late.

50:16.047 --> 50:19.148
- I know.
- I'm sorry, but,

50:19.150 --> 50:23.386
but I did my peak effort.

50:23.388 --> 50:27.356
I was--
I was trying to be subversive.

50:27.358 --> 50:33.062
I researched for you, and it's a
traditional dance from the Ivory Coast.

50:33.064 --> 50:37.066
It's basically like twerking. It's nice.

50:37.068 --> 50:40.236
Should we be on some
traditional African shit in it?

50:40.238 --> 50:44.540
To hell with the legacy
of the chasm and patriarch,

50:44.542 --> 50:46.108
- patriarchy
- Patriarchy.

50:46.110 --> 50:49.111
I know, I understand,
I'm smart too, I get it.

51:07.799 --> 51:11.667
<i>So, I just watched the video and</i>

51:12.570 --> 51:16.605
<i>it's risqué, you are vulnerable,
you're showing yourself.</i>

51:16.607 --> 51:19.075
Oh my God,
the video is so cool.

51:19.811 --> 51:21.143
Take it off, it feels good.

51:21.145 --> 51:25.347
I'm free. Oh, I feel so free.

51:25.349 --> 51:28.217
Make the perfect
PMS video for your application.

51:29.253 --> 51:32.088
<i> They're giving you an interview,
and I think once they talk to you,</i>

51:32.090 --> 51:34.190
<i>- they'll feel the same I feel.</i>
- It's good.

51:34.192 --> 51:36.258
We totally have to go shopping,

51:36.260 --> 51:38.461
we're gonna find you
the most awesome outfit, okay?

51:38.463 --> 51:44.166
Sole, this is so cute.

51:44.168 --> 51:45.101
Try this on.

51:46.471 --> 51:49.672
Come on, try stuff on.

51:52.343 --> 51:53.676
Can you turn around?

51:53.678 --> 51:56.112
Who cares, it's just me.

51:57.115 --> 52:02.218
I need you to turn around.

52:05.423 --> 52:07.723
<i> You are vulnerable,</i>
<i>you're showing yourself.</i>

52:07.725 --> 52:09.525
<i> Take it off,</i>
<i>it feels good.</i>

52:09.527 --> 52:13.129
Do you need me
to help you zip it?

52:13.131 --> 52:14.463
- It's not gonna zip.
- It is.

52:14.465 --> 52:16.899
Just lift it up, it's okay.

52:16.901 --> 52:20.336
<i>- Sole, babe.
- Look at your butt.</i>

52:20.338 --> 52:21.570
You can try on
other things, look?

52:21.572 --> 52:24.840
This is--
This looks more, like, me.

52:30.681 --> 52:33.149
Hey, are you okay, here?

52:36.254 --> 52:38.854
You good? Look,
I'm gonna take you to the best

52:38.856 --> 52:42.224
pizza place, and they
have vegan pizza too, so.

52:43.361 --> 52:46.395
I need to find
something to wear.

52:47.765 --> 52:51.167
- Okay, we'll just try another store.
- I'm not going to find anything.

52:51.169 --> 52:52.368
Come on then,
let's go get pizza.

52:52.370 --> 52:54.170
I don't want pizza!

53:48.526 --> 53:50.492
You talk with me for a bit?

53:50.494 --> 53:52.628
- Okay.
- How does this grant

53:52.630 --> 53:53.696
work with your grandma?

53:55.466 --> 53:57.366
I just need to get it.

53:58.436 --> 54:00.436
M-hm, you'll get it.

54:01.839 --> 54:07.710
- You think so?
- M-hm.

54:07.712 --> 54:11.347
You know, I admire the way
you're going for what you want.

54:12.650 --> 54:15.517
If my dad didn't pay for NYU,
I wouldn't think

54:15.519 --> 54:17.519
to do all this
work for a scholarship.

54:19.724 --> 54:20.956
Thank you.

54:26.831 --> 54:28.597
I like you, Sole.

54:30.501 --> 54:31.934
I like you a lot.

54:47.718 --> 54:51.287
Don't die.

54:51.922 --> 54:54.290
He looked at me all funny.

54:55.660 --> 54:57.893
God, cause your hot.

55:00.331 --> 55:01.430
Oh, shit.

55:09.774 --> 55:12.341
Excuse me, sorry, man,
excuse me, sorry.

55:12.343 --> 55:15.077
Excuse me,
I didn't see you there.

55:21.719 --> 55:23.485
Hold it in, hold it in.

55:23.487 --> 55:27.022
I'm fucked up,
smoking one joint.

55:27.024 --> 55:30.726
Wait, is this
gonna make me hungry?

55:30.728 --> 55:32.795
Duh, it called the munchies.

55:32.797 --> 55:37.099
Oh um, I made a Pinterest board
full of like different ideas

55:37.101 --> 55:42.404
and costumes. Don't
fall on your pals.

56:03.761 --> 56:05.494
Oh my God,
you're dying, you're dying.

56:05.496 --> 56:07.096
Okay, give it here.

56:08.766 --> 56:10.599
Cheers, cheers!

56:11.502 --> 56:12.801
Oh my God.

56:18.642 --> 56:20.542
Oh my god.

56:20.544 --> 56:22.077
Are you good?

56:53.911 --> 56:57.279
How come you're drinking?

56:57.280 --> 57:00.648
Didn't want to keep
thinking about my interview.

57:00.651 --> 57:01.950
Hopefully, they'll see what

57:01.952 --> 57:04.753
I'm trying to do with PMS's,

57:04.755 --> 57:09.458
rooted in giving youth a voice.

57:13.731 --> 57:14.897
What are you thinking?

57:17.535 --> 57:19.001
I want to kiss you.

57:20.771 --> 57:24.006
Can I,
I won't unless you're serious?

57:25.643 --> 57:27.042
- Hm.
- Hm?

57:42.660 --> 57:43.792
Um...

57:46.096 --> 57:47.830
I think I need some water.

57:49.700 --> 57:50.766
- Don't you want--
- You're laughing at me.

57:50.768 --> 57:52.100
I'm not laugh--

57:52.102 --> 57:53.735
I'm laughing with you.

57:58.876 --> 58:01.610
Looking at PMS,
you can see that--

58:01.612 --> 58:03.712
Looking at PMS, each of us--
You can see that--

58:03.714 --> 58:06.248
Approaches the
images differently--

58:06.250 --> 58:10.752
If I receive this grant, when I travel
to Sierra Leone, It won't just be me

58:10.754 --> 58:13.021
- telling them how to--
- Can we order pizza sometimes.

58:13.023 --> 58:17.159
You can order it, I'm doing
a cleanse to clear up my mind.

58:18.562 --> 58:22.764
If I receive this grant,
when I travel to Sierra Leone,

58:25.836 --> 58:29.004
Looking at PMS, you can see,
each of us approaches the--

58:44.889 --> 58:45.921
A real arcanum.

58:48.225 --> 58:49.625
Oh!

59:05.943 --> 59:08.577
Why don't you just ask her.

59:09.980 --> 59:12.180
I'm surrendering, I'm not going

59:12.182 --> 59:13.982
to force her to come back here.

59:15.786 --> 59:18.320
Irene, stop.

59:20.090 --> 59:21.056
Oh.

59:25.162 --> 59:27.729
Lord, help me to let it go.

59:27.731 --> 59:31.934
You know, I know that He's going
to bring her back to me.

59:34.305 --> 59:35.270
And--

59:39.977 --> 59:43.345
Sole.

59:45.049 --> 59:46.014
Sole.

59:52.723 --> 59:54.590
You're hot.

59:54.592 --> 01:00:01.663
They are going to love you. Ok.

01:00:05.069 --> 01:00:06.034
Ow.

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:25.921
As Dr. Helene Kanem would say,

01:00:25.923 --> 01:00:28.123
practice is worth all the gifts.

01:00:28.125 --> 01:00:31.326
Okay, um, my father
was a strong believer that

01:00:31.328 --> 01:00:34.262
the African should be at the
head of their own development.

01:00:34.264 --> 01:00:36.298
The stuff we need connected--

01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:38.300
...is where it all begins --

01:00:38.302 --> 01:00:39.635
My father--

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:44.373
<i>♪ -Did you go downtown?
♪ -Yes ma'am! ♪</i>

01:00:44.375 --> 01:00:46.274

01:00:46.276 --> 01:00:48.377

01:00:48.379 --> 01:00:50.045

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:12.968
Sole?

01:01:33.824 --> 01:01:38.360
- Do you feel like you can talk to me about stuff?
- Hmm?

01:01:38.362 --> 01:01:42.197
Do you feel like you
can talk to me about stuff?

01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:43.165
Yeah, sure.

01:01:44.802 --> 01:01:46.935
Okay, praxis, praxis, praxis.

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:56.445
What is that piss? When the last
time you had real food?

01:01:56.447 --> 01:01:58.980
It's an energy cleanse,
you should try it.

01:01:58.982 --> 01:02:00.082
Um, no.

01:02:05.456 --> 01:02:06.421
Sole.

01:02:07.791 --> 01:02:08.790
Sole.

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:11.827
Look.

01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:12.794
You stopped?

01:02:13.731 --> 01:02:14.496
Yeah.

01:02:15.933 --> 01:02:17.499
Okay.

01:02:17.501 --> 01:02:21.770
If we tie in autonomy
with praxis, then I can--

01:02:21.772 --> 01:02:24.439
I was gonna save
this for a surprise,

01:02:24.441 --> 01:02:27.209
but I might be
going to New York.

01:02:27.211 --> 01:02:28.844
Okay, praxis, praxis.

01:02:28.846 --> 01:02:30.011
I just submitted the PMS footage

01:02:30.013 --> 01:02:31.947
and I'm up for a scholarship.

01:02:31.949 --> 01:02:33.181
What?

01:02:33.183 --> 01:02:34.449
Yeah, I got an audition.

01:02:34.451 --> 01:02:35.517
It's in a week.

01:02:39.456 --> 01:02:41.289
You submitted my footage.

01:02:42.493 --> 01:02:45.460
Okay, see, look,
this is-- you're not eating

01:02:45.462 --> 01:02:47.929
and you're acting
really strange, really weird.

01:02:47.931 --> 01:02:50.532
- I'm the weird one? Wow!
- Yes, you are the weird one.

01:02:50.534 --> 01:02:54.002
- You're acting weird.
- I'm not the one with scars all over my body.

01:02:56.173 --> 01:02:58.240
I can't believe--

01:03:00.944 --> 01:03:01.943
I found your pills.

01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:08.083
You went through my shit?

01:03:08.085 --> 01:03:09.551
What are they?

01:03:14.324 --> 01:03:17.092
I ca-- I can't believe you
went through my shit.

01:03:17.094 --> 01:03:18.293
I didn't do it on purpose.

01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:20.529
- Shut up! Shut up!
- I found them.

01:03:22.266 --> 01:03:24.032
I-- I can't.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:38.079
Sole.

01:03:55.098 --> 01:03:56.965
Fuck.

01:04:34.271 --> 01:04:36.004
Can I have a cigarette?

01:04:45.148 --> 01:04:47.015
I'm worried about you, you know.

01:05:04.268 --> 01:05:06.935
Wait, wait, wait.

01:05:12.242 --> 01:05:14.309
What happened with Jasmine?

01:05:15.445 --> 01:05:17.178
You're worried about Jasmine.

01:05:22.419 --> 01:05:24.586
- Not like this, okay.
- What?

01:05:24.588 --> 01:05:27.689
Come on, stop, stop.

01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:34.296
Forget it.

01:05:35.132 --> 01:05:36.398
Don't touch me.

01:05:46.543 --> 01:05:48.710
Sole, what the hell?

01:05:48.712 --> 01:05:50.478
You're such a hypocrite.

01:05:53.717 --> 01:05:55.434
What are you talking about?

01:05:55.435 --> 01:05:57.152
You're a good liar,
but your dick isn't.

01:06:02.025 --> 01:06:03.658
Fuck you, you never liked me.

01:06:04.394 --> 01:06:06.161
I do like you,
I just want to talk right now.

01:06:06.163 --> 01:06:08.430
Why does everybody
want to fucking talk?

01:06:12.602 --> 01:06:13.802
Huh?

01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:15.003
If you come any closer,
I'll scream.

01:06:16.139 --> 01:06:18.506
Sole.

01:07:56.373 --> 01:07:58.640
Sole, what did you take?

01:07:58.642 --> 01:08:00.341
What did you take?

01:08:01.278 --> 01:08:03.611
Okay, she opened
her eyes a little bit.

01:08:04.848 --> 01:08:10.118
I can't tell is she's-- should
we take her to the hospital?

01:08:42.819 --> 01:08:44.219
Here we go.

01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:45.620
Thank you, darling.

01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:50.457
Oh, phone, am I blowing up.

01:08:53.796 --> 01:08:55.863
Honey, it's Sole.

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:02.337
- Hello.
- Pastor Davis, it's Jasmine, I found Sole

01:09:02.339 --> 01:09:04.706
and she's passed out
and I don't, I don't know.

01:09:06.143 --> 01:09:08.176
Well, come on, come on.

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:38.939
<i>Please leave your message.</i>

01:09:47.817 --> 01:09:50.718
She's just
crying out for help.

01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:53.621
You need to ask
the Lord what to do.

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:55.223
I did ask the Lord.

01:09:55.225 --> 01:09:56.925
I've asked the Lord
over and over again.

01:09:56.927 --> 01:09:59.894
I was praying for Pearl,
I've been praying for Sole.

01:09:59.896 --> 01:10:05.266
But I know, I know that faith without
works is that I just don't know what to do.

01:10:05.268 --> 01:10:07.335
Lord God you are my witness,
I have asked you,

01:10:07.337 --> 01:10:09.370
I need to do something,
I need to do something,

01:10:09.372 --> 01:10:10.872
I just don't know.

01:10:25.689 --> 01:10:29.424
<i> Sole, you're impressive. Dr. Kanem
is right, you seem older than you are.</i>

01:10:29.426 --> 01:10:36.431
Thank you. Um, Dr. Kanem's work is really
important to me, and I am really eager

01:10:36.433 --> 01:10:40.935
to continue growing and learning
from her as much as possible.

01:10:40.937 --> 01:10:45.807
<i>Okay, well, we spoke about your project, your
future visions. Tell me about your weaknesses,</i>

01:10:45.809 --> 01:10:47.575
<i>what is it that
you grapple with?</i>

01:10:48.778 --> 01:10:49.844
Weaknesses?

01:10:55.552 --> 01:10:58.386
I-- I tend to

01:10:58.388 --> 01:11:00.655
think I don't need anyone.

01:11:01.891 --> 01:11:02.857
But...

01:11:05.362 --> 01:11:07.295
I need...

01:11:07.297 --> 01:11:09.264
I mean, we all need someone.

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:11.966
<i>That is profound.</i>

01:11:11.968 --> 01:11:15.737
<i>Well, last few questions
from me, that's it.</i>

01:11:16.806 --> 01:11:20.908
Thank you,
I appreciate the opportunity.

01:11:20.910 --> 01:11:22.944
<i>Don't look so disappointed,
you got it.</i>

01:11:24.381 --> 01:11:25.413
I have the grant?

01:11:34.924 --> 01:11:37.725
Thank you.
Thanks. Um..

01:11:37.727 --> 01:11:39.727
Okay, bye.

01:11:54.978 --> 01:11:57.412
<i> What the fuck is up,</i>
<i>leave a message.</i>

01:11:59.349 --> 01:12:00.815
Hey, um...

01:12:02.819 --> 01:12:03.951
I got the grant.

01:12:07.057 --> 01:12:08.656
Did you go to your audition?

01:12:10.527 --> 01:12:13.695
I-- I hope it went well.

01:12:28.545 --> 01:12:31.746
Don't you have
an audition today?

01:12:31.748 --> 01:12:33.581
- Hm?
- The audition?

01:12:33.583 --> 01:12:35.883
No, no, no, no, that's tomorrow.

01:12:48.131 --> 01:12:49.831
Where are you going?

01:12:51.601 --> 01:12:52.767
Where are you going?

01:13:53.997 --> 01:13:55.863
Can I ask you a question?

01:13:55.865 --> 01:13:58.800
Why didn't you want me
to be on your tour?

01:13:58.802 --> 01:14:00.568
Give me your phone, trade.

01:14:05.942 --> 01:14:09.210
You said your audition was tomorrow,
but your phone calendar says

01:14:09.212 --> 01:14:12.180
- it was 30 minutes ago.
- Okay.

01:14:12.182 --> 01:14:16.684
So you don't show up for yourself,
so why do you expect me to think that

01:14:16.686 --> 01:14:18.453
you would show up
for me on tour?

01:14:18.455 --> 01:14:20.755
Nobody takes care of me
but me, and you know that.

01:14:20.757 --> 01:14:23.791
Jasmine, that is not
true as long as I've known you.

01:14:23.793 --> 01:14:25.793
I mean, you have to
put out for yourself.

01:14:25.795 --> 01:14:28.563
- You gotta do it,
you gotta go for it. -Mhm.

01:14:28.565 --> 01:14:31.866
Otherwise, what am I
supposed to think. You know?

01:14:32.869 --> 01:14:35.503
Nah, you got
a missed call from Sole.

01:16:04.027 --> 01:16:07.261
Talk to me Sole, how bad is it?

01:16:14.037 --> 01:16:15.836
Are you bulimic?

01:16:15.838 --> 01:16:18.339
Do I look bulimic, Irene?

01:16:18.341 --> 01:16:19.907
Let me help you, please.

01:16:21.077 --> 01:16:22.710
I need you to back off.

01:16:23.346 --> 01:16:25.580
Oh my fucking gosh, wow.

01:16:27.216 --> 01:16:31.752
We can get a good doctor,
a good therapist,

01:16:31.754 --> 01:16:35.790
- Sometimes God has other plans.
- Fuck God, Irene.

01:16:37.894 --> 01:16:41.028
I am so sorry.

01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:47.268
- You just-- stop, okay you're not my mother.
- I'm still your family.

01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:49.236
Leave me alone,
I want to get in the house,

01:16:49.238 --> 01:16:51.072
you don't get it.

01:16:51.074 --> 01:16:53.207
Sweetheart, we're all we have.

01:16:53.209 --> 01:16:55.810
It isn't fair.

01:16:55.812 --> 01:17:00.781
I know it's not fair, I know
it's not fair, it's not fair.

01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:06.754
I don't-- I don't want you
to hug me, just don't.

01:17:06.756 --> 01:17:09.690
I know this is hard, darling.

01:17:09.692 --> 01:17:12.893
I'm angry too, I'm angry too.

01:17:19.102 --> 01:17:22.870
Oh, you can my dear, yeah, come.

01:17:25.241 --> 01:17:27.074
I just want my dad.

01:17:27.076 --> 01:17:29.410
I know, I am here.

01:17:33.349 --> 01:17:37.084
- I'm here.
- I don't want to be here, Irene.

01:17:37.086 --> 01:17:38.386
I know you don't.

01:17:39.956 --> 01:17:41.889
- No, I--
- You want to be in New York.

01:17:43.226 --> 01:17:44.925
And I'm not going to stop you.

01:17:54.404 --> 01:17:55.369
You won't?

01:17:57.807 --> 01:18:00.174
I'm going to go everything
that I can to help you.

01:18:06.049 --> 01:18:07.081
Why?

01:18:11.854 --> 01:18:15.222
I want you to be happy.

01:18:19.062 --> 01:18:21.862
I want you to be at peace.

01:18:21.864 --> 01:18:22.830
And you know what?

01:18:25.201 --> 01:18:30.237
Maybe I was wrong.
Maybe I can grow too.

01:18:31.274 --> 01:18:32.807
I can learn too.

01:18:35.712 --> 01:18:38.779
Please give me a chance.

01:18:47.423 --> 01:18:49.390
Was my mother really bulimic?

01:18:56.165 --> 01:18:57.231
Yes.

01:19:00.036 --> 01:19:03.504
I've never eaten out of
the trash before, I swear.

01:19:07.944 --> 01:19:09.510
And I don't want to do it again.

01:19:14.917 --> 01:19:18.986
Somethings wrong with me,
somethings happening to me.

01:19:18.988 --> 01:19:20.254
And I'm scared.

01:19:24.527 --> 01:19:26.360
I can't stop eating.

01:19:32.869 --> 01:19:34.435
I am here with you now.

01:19:35.371 --> 01:19:37.404
We could deal,
now that I'm here.

01:19:37.406 --> 01:19:40.307
I am here now, darling.

01:19:40.309 --> 01:19:44.912
I'm here now.
