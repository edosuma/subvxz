00:00.533 --> 00:01.867
      (upbeat march plays)

00:01.869 --> 00:06.638
     ¶ Good morning, USA!

00:06.640 --> 00:10.542
  ¶ I got a feeling that it's
   gonna be a wonderful day ¶

00:10.544 --> 00:13.545
      ¶ The sun in the sky
   has a smile on his face ¶

00:13.547 --> 00:18.083
  ¶ And he's shining a salute
     to the American race ¶

00:19.819 --> 00:23.122
 ¶ Oh, boy, it's swell to say

00:23.124 --> 00:25.157
                   ¶ Good...
¶ Good morning, USA

00:25.159 --> 00:26.925
       Aah!

00:28.028 --> 00:31.363
     ¶ Good morning, USA!

00:34.034 --> 00:36.335
      Good... morning, everyone.

00:36.337 --> 00:38.504
               It is a beautiful
                 72 degrees out.

00:38.506 --> 00:39.905
                         (sighs)

00:39.907 --> 00:41.206
      Today has so much promise.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.909
             Today?
       Try Berlin in '38.

00:43.911 --> 00:45.544
   So many different people.

00:45.546 --> 00:46.845
       So many opinions.

00:46.847 --> 00:49.882
    A marketplace of ideas.

00:49.884 --> 00:51.984
                         Anyway,
                today in sex-ed,

00:51.986 --> 00:54.686
        we're asking our teacher
            anonymous questions.

00:54.688 --> 00:56.221
              It can be anything
                we want to know.

00:56.223 --> 00:57.523
      That's great, honey.

00:57.525 --> 00:58.924
You know, Steve,
legend has it,

00:58.926 --> 01:00.893
that if you can stump
a sex-ed teacher,

01:00.895 --> 01:03.062
you become the
sex-ed teacher.

01:03.064 --> 01:06.231
 (imitates <i>Highlander):</i>
<i> "There can be only one!"</i>

01:06.233 --> 01:08.333
          Hey. Did you guys know
         that there's a landmass

01:08.335 --> 01:11.003
       made up of garbage that's
  floating in the Pacific Ocean?

01:11.005 --> 01:12.771
         You shouldn't
      have to go <i>that</i> far

01:12.773 --> 01:14.573
       just to throw away
       that manly jacket.

01:14.575 --> 01:17.709
     Well, I'm tired of ignoring
           the world's problems.

01:17.711 --> 01:21.046
   So, today, I start my new job
       for a local news reporter

01:21.048 --> 01:22.347
          with a brand-new show.

01:22.349 --> 01:23.849
     Oh, that sounds hard.

01:23.851 --> 01:25.451
          Are you sure
      you want to bother?

01:25.453 --> 01:28.020
    Look, this is my chance
   to get the truth out there

01:28.022 --> 01:30.522
      about Garbage Island
   and so many other things.

01:30.524 --> 01:34.393
 People need to know the dangers
     of eating non-organic fruit

01:34.395 --> 01:35.427
         and that vaccines are--

01:35.429 --> 01:36.395
Hayley! Behind you!

01:36.397 --> 01:37.796
     (footsteps departing)

01:37.798 --> 01:39.264
         (all grunting)

01:39.266 --> 01:41.467
Damn it!
One at a time, you guys.

01:41.469 --> 01:43.569
This is why we had
all those drills.

01:43.571 --> 01:45.037
           Whatever.

01:45.039 --> 01:47.139
      I'm going out there
     to make a difference.

01:47.141 --> 01:48.607
      ("Let the River Run"
     by Carly Simon begins)

01:48.609 --> 01:52.444
 ¶ It's asking for the taking

01:52.446 --> 01:56.949
     ¶ Trembling, shaking

01:56.951 --> 02:02.955
   ¶ Oh, my heart is aching

02:02.957 --> 02:04.389
  ¶ We're coming to the edge

02:04.391 --> 02:05.791
    ¶ Running on the water

02:05.793 --> 02:06.959
   ¶ Coming through the fog

02:06.961 --> 02:08.894
  ¶ Your sons and daughters

02:33.521 --> 02:34.987
Oh, come on!

02:37.624 --> 02:38.957
              ¶

02:38.959 --> 02:40.492
I'm Genevieve Vavance.

02:40.494 --> 02:41.860
    Tonight on <i>News Glance:</i>

02:41.862 --> 02:43.962
         Is heroin the
      new cure for cancer?

02:43.964 --> 02:46.632
 What I don't know about things
        will shock you.

02:46.634 --> 02:48.667
           And cut. We're clear.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.002
          You're late.

02:50.004 --> 02:51.603
 <i>You're </i>
<i> Genevieve Vavance?</i>

02:51.605 --> 02:53.939
  I thought I was working for
        a real reporter.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.674
     I am a real reporter.

02:55.676 --> 02:58.844
  I broadcast live to Langley
Falls every night on channel 438

02:58.846 --> 03:01.146
      after reruns of the
  Taiwanese prayer breakfast.

03:01.148 --> 03:03.315
             First pitch meeting
              is this afternoon.

03:03.317 --> 03:05.117
              Prepare to wow me.

03:05.119 --> 03:06.451
                  You're already
                  halfway there.

03:06.453 --> 03:07.519
             I love that jacket.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.520
                  Is it...?

03:08.522 --> 03:10.355
                 Yeah. Cheap.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.328
           All right.
   It's time for me to answer

03:16.330 --> 03:18.664
    your anonymous questions
           about sex.

03:18.666 --> 03:21.066
  "I've had sex three times."

03:21.068 --> 03:22.167
             Kudos.

03:22.169 --> 03:24.369
   But that's not a question.

03:24.371 --> 03:27.539
   "What's it called when you
  kiss someone on the toilet?"

03:27.541 --> 03:28.974
         Good question.

03:28.976 --> 03:32.711
      Scientists call that
    a "San Diego Thank You."

03:34.247 --> 03:38.717
 "Is it true that, during sex,
  a woman's uterus can create

03:38.719 --> 03:42.688
 a vacuum-like effect and suck
   a person up inside of it?"

03:42.690 --> 03:44.022
        (class laughing)

03:44.024 --> 03:45.324
Idiot.

03:45.326 --> 03:46.425
       Hold up. Hold up.

03:46.427 --> 03:48.560
 I recognize this handwriting.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.362
      It's Steve Smith's.

03:50.364 --> 03:51.730
      (laughing continues)
GIRL: Loser!

03:51.732 --> 03:55.033
    Hey, Steve! Look out...!

03:55.035 --> 03:57.169
           (whooshes)

03:57.171 --> 04:00.672
    (laughing and whooshing
           continue)

04:03.042 --> 04:04.910
Okay. Story ideas.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.678
Now, I don't know
where you worked before,

04:06.680 --> 04:09.414
but Genevieve Vavance does
things a little differently.

04:10.550 --> 04:12.084
          Now, pitch.

04:13.286 --> 04:15.387
    How 'bout we do a report
       on the corruption

04:15.389 --> 04:16.688
   in the Langley Light Rail?

04:16.690 --> 04:17.689
              No.

04:17.690 --> 04:18.957
         (gun clicking)

04:18.959 --> 04:20.591
            (sighs)
       Can we please get

04:20.594 --> 04:23.895
  a bullet intern to make sure
     I always have bullets?

04:23.897 --> 04:25.130
MAN: We had one.
          We had one?

04:25.132 --> 04:26.565
     What happened to her?

04:26.567 --> 04:28.133
       Oh, that's right.

04:28.135 --> 04:29.768
    She went back to school.

04:29.770 --> 04:30.869
         She was great.

04:30.871 --> 04:32.437
  She's gonna do great things.

04:32.439 --> 04:35.540
  Well, I want to do an exposé
     about Garbage Island.

04:35.542 --> 04:38.377
   It's a giant mass of trash
  polluting the Pacific Ocean.

04:38.379 --> 04:39.311
    You know what's garbage?

04:39.313 --> 04:40.912
          That story.

04:40.914 --> 04:43.148
Come on, I need something juicy
      to boost my ratings!

04:43.150 --> 04:44.549
 I need a serial killer priest!

04:44.551 --> 04:46.118
    I need a vegetarian cop!

04:46.120 --> 04:48.453
   I need a senator cheating
   on his wife with a bagel!

04:48.455 --> 04:50.889
(yells, grunts)

04:50.891 --> 04:52.224
All of you,
get out there

04:52.226 --> 04:55.127
and find me
my JonBenét Ramsey!

04:55.129 --> 04:57.996
 But Garbage Island is a story
   that people need to hear.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.264
I'll tell you what:

04:59.266 --> 05:01.667
you find me a story
that gets me ratings

05:01.669 --> 05:04.936
and I'll let you report
on as much idealistic
crap as you want.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.972
                      Genevieve?
        My bagel and I are ready

05:06.974 --> 05:09.074
                to tell our side
                   of the story.

05:09.076 --> 05:10.976
You have my ear, Senator.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.081
                Today was awful.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.316
     Someone spray painted

05:17.318 --> 05:18.850
      "Steve Smith thinks
         vaginas suck"

05:18.852 --> 05:20.085
         on my locker.

05:20.087 --> 05:21.353
So what?
People think you're gay.

05:21.355 --> 05:22.754
            (scoffs)
            I wish!

05:22.756 --> 05:24.256
No one thinks I'm sexual at all,

05:24.258 --> 05:26.491
 because of the stupid question
       I asked in class.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.293
My day was worse.

05:28.295 --> 05:30.262
My new boss is Roger.

05:30.264 --> 05:32.197
I-I wanted to make
a difference in the world,

05:32.199 --> 05:34.633
but he just wants
a missing kid
to sensationalize.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.268
      Missing kids are so lucky.

05:36.270 --> 05:38.303
                     I'd kill to
            disappear right now.

05:38.305 --> 05:39.971
        Wait a minute...

05:39.973 --> 05:41.440
   What if you did disappear?

05:41.442 --> 05:42.474
               What do you mean?

05:42.476 --> 05:43.642
Yeah. Yeah.

05:43.644 --> 05:45.277
We pretend
you were kidnapped

05:45.279 --> 05:46.945
and we hide you away
for a week,

05:46.947 --> 05:48.880
Roger gets his
missing person story

05:48.882 --> 05:51.483
and then I get to do my exposé
on Garbage Island.

05:51.485 --> 05:52.551
                   That's great!

05:52.553 --> 05:53.885
         By the time I get back,

05:53.887 --> 05:55.454
              everyone will have
             forgotten all about

05:55.456 --> 05:57.055
                 my ignorance of
                 the fairer sex!

05:57.057 --> 05:58.357
I'm not as concerned about

05:58.359 --> 06:00.592
what you're getting
out of it, but sure.

06:04.163 --> 06:05.831
      I rented this cabin
       for the next week.

06:05.833 --> 06:07.466
   Y-You sure
   you'll be okay?

06:07.468 --> 06:09.201
                   Of course!
                I'll be fine.

06:10.803 --> 06:11.803
Geez, Steve.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.405
Four gallons of Lubriderm?

06:13.407 --> 06:16.141
                  You try living
                    with eczema.

06:16.143 --> 06:17.209
All right.

06:17.211 --> 06:19.077
Time to report
a disappearance.

06:19.079 --> 06:20.979
            (sighs)
   (phone beeps, line rings)

06:20.981 --> 06:22.080
ROGER:
Hello?

06:22.082 --> 06:23.181
               (voice breaking):
                      Genevieve?

06:23.183 --> 06:24.216
                    It's Hayley.

06:24.218 --> 06:25.717
                  I think I have
                     your story.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.853
               My little brother
               has gone missing!

06:27.855 --> 06:29.054
Steve is missing?!

06:29.056 --> 06:30.422
How horrible for him.

06:30.424 --> 06:31.757
But fantastic for us!

06:31.759 --> 06:32.891
We can make this
national news!

06:32.893 --> 06:34.493
         (phone beeps)

06:34.495 --> 06:36.561
       They said I wasn't
  good enough for television.

06:36.563 --> 06:39.164
    How do you like me now,
       voices in my head?

06:39.166 --> 06:41.933
 There's no pleasing you guys!

06:41.935 --> 06:43.168
       No, not you, Marc.

06:43.170 --> 06:44.903
 You're always super positive.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.678
      This is <i>News Glance</i>

06:55.549 --> 06:58.016
        Sad news out of
     Langley Falls tonight,

06:58.018 --> 07:00.252
      stunningly gorgeous
      high school student,

07:00.254 --> 07:02.220
          Steve Smith,
       has gone missing.

07:02.222 --> 07:05.690
  Athletic. Chiseled. Missing.

07:05.692 --> 07:08.126
 All we know right now is that
  Steve was last seen at home

07:08.128 --> 07:10.729
        with his family
      and he is adorable.

07:10.731 --> 07:13.198
    This isn't some ugly kid
     who went missing. No.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.733
 This is a person who matters.

07:14.735 --> 07:17.235
      To fully understand
  the weight of this tragedy,

07:17.237 --> 07:19.871
let's take a look at some photos
     of Steve to the song,

07:19.873 --> 07:22.240
         "It's So Hard
 to Say Goodbye to Yesterday,"

07:22.242 --> 07:25.977
  from the notable <i>Boyz II Men</i>
  <i> album, "Cooleyhighharmony."</i>

07:25.979 --> 07:30.549
      ¶ And I'll take...
        ¶ <i>Take with me</i> ¶

07:30.551 --> 07:34.052
  ¶ With me the memories...

07:34.054 --> 07:36.221
     ¶ To be my sunshine

07:36.223 --> 07:39.157
       ¶ After the rain

07:39.159 --> 07:43.161
        ¶ It's so hard
            ¶ <i>Hard</i> ¶

07:43.163 --> 07:46.731
       ¶ To say goodbye
            ¶ <i>Bye</i> ¶

07:46.733 --> 07:51.837
       ¶ To yesterday.
            ¶ <i>Day.</i> ¶

07:51.839 --> 07:53.738
          (song ends)

07:53.740 --> 07:56.775
  It's too early to speculate
whether Steve is dead or alive,

07:56.777 --> 07:58.643
    but, when we come back,
          it won't be.

07:58.645 --> 07:59.945
            And now,
    a word from our sponsor,

07:59.947 --> 08:00.946
           BeerWater.

08:00.948 --> 08:01.980
        (bird screeches)

08:01.982 --> 08:04.950
 You can lead a horse to water,

08:04.952 --> 08:07.752
 but you can't make him party.

08:07.754 --> 08:09.754
   Unless you have BeerWater!

08:09.756 --> 08:12.491
      (house music plays)

08:16.596 --> 08:19.965
               BeerWater--
            quench your sober.

08:19.967 --> 08:22.367
This is great, right?!

08:22.369 --> 08:23.635
I just saw the early ratings

08:23.637 --> 08:24.936
and we're holding 81 percent

08:24.938 --> 08:26.538
of the Taiwanese
prayer breakfast numbers.

08:26.540 --> 08:29.207
     Yeah. Listen, now that
   I got you your hot story,

08:29.209 --> 08:31.443
    I get to do my report on
     Garbage Island, right?

08:31.445 --> 08:32.878
Yeah. We're definitely
gonna do that.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.846
A thousand percent,
top priority on my mind.

08:34.847 --> 08:37.148
GROUP:
¶ It's so hard...

08:37.150 --> 08:38.350
          What the hell is that?

08:38.352 --> 08:40.519
             GROUP:
     ¶ To say goodbye...

08:40.520 --> 08:41.785
       And we...

08:41.788 --> 08:44.789
have... vigil.
       ¶ To yesterday.

08:44.791 --> 08:48.360
         (women crying)

08:48.362 --> 08:50.228
   Look how sad everyone is.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.463
          I did this!

08:51.465 --> 08:55.233
        Officer, please,
       find our baby boy.

08:55.235 --> 08:58.136
   We're doing everything we can
      with the evidence we have.

08:58.138 --> 08:59.838
                  Which... is...

08:59.840 --> 09:01.172
                    no evidence.

09:01.174 --> 09:03.041
              But we will, uh...

09:03.043 --> 09:04.776
                       find him?

09:05.811 --> 09:08.413
   Whoa. A monkey
   holding a banana?!

09:08.415 --> 09:11.082
So many Beanie Babies here
I haven't seen before.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.651
Francine, look at this one!

09:12.653 --> 09:14.686
    It's a bear
    in a bunny costume.

09:14.688 --> 09:17.255
What are you doing
in a bunny costume, bear?

09:17.257 --> 09:20.058
   I'm here with the parents,
    Stan and Francine Smith.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.526
Do you folks
have a statement?

09:21.528 --> 09:23.862
                     I just want
           my baby to come home.

09:23.864 --> 09:25.263
Of course you do.

09:25.265 --> 09:27.198
But I'd let yourself
want other things, too.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.900
I mean, we're at a vigil.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.503
It's not like you have those
when things are going great.

09:31.505 --> 09:33.905
                        (crying)

09:34.907 --> 09:36.341
      If you'll excuse me,

09:36.343 --> 09:38.076
          I have to go
      comfort my wife now.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.378
      I bet a Beanie Baby
      would cheer her up.

09:40.380 --> 09:41.746
         Like this one.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.048
    She might like this one.

09:43.050 --> 09:44.249
            (gasps)
     This one reminds me of

09:44.251 --> 09:45.684
        Abigail Breslin.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.986
 Not so much the way it looks,
        but its energy.

09:50.022 --> 09:51.289
             Great work, Hayley!

09:51.291 --> 09:52.857
                   This story is
             just what I needed.

09:52.859 --> 09:55.026
   I know, but I feel awful.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.561
     My mom is devastated.

09:56.563 --> 09:58.463
          Well, yeah,
   her little baby's missing.

09:58.465 --> 10:00.065
Th-That's the thing,
he's...

10:00.067 --> 10:01.533
    (groans)

10:01.535 --> 10:03.134
...he's not really missing.

10:03.136 --> 10:05.904
I, I kind of staged
the whole thing.

10:05.906 --> 10:08.273
             Oh, my God, Hayley!

10:08.275 --> 10:10.375
            You're a journalist!
   What?!

10:10.377 --> 10:11.743
             Sure!

10:11.745 --> 10:13.311
   We don't report the news,
          we make it.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.113
 Accuracy is so time-consuming.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.414
    Fiction is the new fact.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.416
Roger, these people
need to know that

10:18.418 --> 10:19.784
Steve isn't missing, okay?

10:19.786 --> 10:21.286
I got to come clean on this.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.821
              You know what else
              has to come clean?

10:22.823 --> 10:24.255
                 Garbage Island.

10:24.257 --> 10:25.624
                 Don't you still
         want to do your report?

10:25.626 --> 10:27.125
        Of course I do!

10:27.127 --> 10:29.828
            But, uh,
   my mom, she's so torn up.

10:29.830 --> 10:32.797
    Look, just let this ride
  for one more day, all right?

10:32.799 --> 10:34.733
   Besides, the more popular
        the story gets,

10:34.735 --> 10:36.101
  the more viewers we'll have

10:36.103 --> 10:37.902
     for your bummer piece
       on Garbage Island.

10:37.904 --> 10:38.937
(sighs) Fine.

10:38.939 --> 10:40.138
One more day.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.273
                      All right.
           I'm gonna take a lap.

10:42.275 --> 10:45.176
It's super easy to take peoples'
   wallets while they're crying.

10:45.178 --> 10:47.846
           ANNOUNCER:
Justice hunter. Philanthropist.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.481
      Has a Gmail account.

10:49.483 --> 10:53.985
      This is <i>News Glance</i>
     <i>with Genevieve Vavance.</i>

10:53.987 --> 10:56.488
Been a tough day for all of us
here at the <i>Glance.</i>

10:56.490 --> 10:59.858
Steve Smith has now been
missing for 36 hours.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.760
           I'm joined by some of
             Steve's classmates.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.128
                   You look like
               the type of girls

11:03.130 --> 11:04.663
                 who do a lot of
             regrettable things.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.264
         How does it feel today,

11:06.266 --> 11:07.866
         knowing you'll probably
          never get to hit that?

11:07.868 --> 11:10.535
                  Sad. Steve was
                    really cute.

11:10.537 --> 11:13.204
             I guess I just wish
            I could've hit that.

11:13.206 --> 11:15.473
       It's so important
    to have sex with people

11:15.475 --> 11:16.608
    before they go missing.

11:16.610 --> 11:18.777
    Mm-hmm.
                       Mmm.
          Mm-hmm.

11:18.779 --> 11:20.311
   All those girls want me?!

11:20.313 --> 11:22.147
            Awesome!

11:22.149 --> 11:25.984
The longer I stay in this cabin,
  the more laid I'm gonna get!

11:25.986 --> 11:27.952
        Yeah.

11:30.289 --> 11:31.322
          More volume!

11:31.324 --> 11:32.691
            I want it super big!

11:32.693 --> 11:34.292
       You're doing a great job.

11:34.294 --> 11:36.361
           I know I'm demanding,
          but I'm working on it.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.530
              But it also got me
               where I am today.

11:38.532 --> 11:40.865
            So when I ask you to
              make it super big,

11:40.867 --> 11:42.300
      I mean, make it super big!

11:42.302 --> 11:44.235
              I will murder you!

11:44.237 --> 11:46.204
                   I'm sorry.
            Work in progress.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.773
             God is not finished
                  with this gal.

11:50.409 --> 11:53.044
Hey, Genevieve, I'm all set to
do my story on Garbage Island.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.646
               Yeah, yeah, yeah,
                we'll get to it.

11:54.648 --> 11:56.915
             But first, I got an
     exclusive with the parents.

11:56.917 --> 11:59.317
Wait. What?!

11:59.319 --> 12:00.819
        And we're back.

12:00.821 --> 12:03.054
I'm here tonight
with Stan and Francine Smith,

12:03.056 --> 12:07.425
heartbroken parents of America's
missing son, Steve Smith.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.861
Stan, Francine,

12:09.863 --> 12:11.763
why did you murder your son?

12:11.765 --> 12:13.865
                          What?!
Not ready to confess?

12:13.867 --> 12:15.600
 Let's look at some statistics.

12:15.602 --> 12:18.737
 100% of the time a child goes
  missing, the parents did it.

12:18.739 --> 12:20.205
           ANNOUNCER:
       <i>Legally not a fact.</i>

12:20.207 --> 12:21.372
What are you talking about?

12:21.374 --> 12:22.440
 And where'd you hide the body?

12:22.442 --> 12:24.008
                       We didn't
                  hide the body.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.243
 So you admit there's a body?!

12:25.245 --> 12:26.377
Why are you doing this?!

12:26.379 --> 12:28.246
I'm sorry.
Its been a long week.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.614
Emotions are running wild.

12:29.616 --> 12:31.716
    Can I get you something?
      A BeerWater perhaps?

12:31.718 --> 12:33.852
          No, thanks.
 That stuff gives me diarrhea.

12:37.757 --> 12:40.125
      Stan, are you close
         with your son?

12:40.127 --> 12:42.060
   No, but that doesn't mean
        I murdered him!

12:42.062 --> 12:44.562
Interesting.
Can we play that back?

12:44.564 --> 12:46.397
        I murdered him!

12:46.399 --> 12:48.266
      You son of a bitch!

12:48.268 --> 12:49.868
           (clicking)
                             Oh!

12:49.870 --> 12:51.636
                         (gasps)
We have
to take a break.

12:51.638 --> 12:53.271
            WOMAN:
          <i>BeerWater...</i>

12:53.273 --> 12:54.906
   <i>it won't give you diarrhea.</i>

12:54.908 --> 12:56.708
        (bird screeches)

12:56.710 --> 12:58.409
(quietly):
Just keep it natural.

12:58.411 --> 13:01.112
You guys are doing great.
You're coming off super likable.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.882
    Francine, how many times
     did you stab your son?

13:03.884 --> 13:05.717
                        None!
Huh.

13:05.719 --> 13:07.786
Well, my team and I
created a reenactment

13:07.788 --> 13:10.555
of what we believe happened
the night Steve disappeared.

13:11.924 --> 13:14.092
         You know what
I've been thinking about lately?

13:14.094 --> 13:16.961
    How Steve is the worst?

13:16.963 --> 13:19.230
      Yes! I kind of want
         to murder him.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.966
          Great idea!
      We'll use my knife!

13:21.968 --> 13:23.668
           (clinking)

13:24.470 --> 13:26.404
       Hi, Mom! Hi, Dad!

13:26.406 --> 13:28.807
Just coming in here to love you.

13:36.315 --> 13:39.984
      I... forgive... you.

13:42.588 --> 13:46.024
           (laughter)

13:47.960 --> 13:50.595
Gruesome stuff.

13:50.597 --> 13:52.931
Can you two stick around
for my next guest? Yeah?

13:52.933 --> 13:55.600
Well, please welcome
Officer Keith Benson!

13:55.602 --> 13:57.936
             What?!
        Stan and Francine Smith,

13:57.938 --> 14:00.471
        you are under arrest for
         the murder of your son.

14:00.473 --> 14:01.539
What the hell?!

14:01.541 --> 14:02.674
             We didn't kill him!

14:02.676 --> 14:03.975
                We love our son!

14:03.977 --> 14:05.476
Wait! Officer, please!

14:05.478 --> 14:07.545
You're making a mistake!

14:07.547 --> 14:09.314
            Tragic.

14:09.316 --> 14:10.715
   After the break: bulimia.

14:10.717 --> 14:13.117
          Bad for you,
but is it good for your toilet?

14:13.119 --> 14:15.253
   Find out tonight at 11:00.

14:19.992 --> 14:21.226
                 Are you crazy?!

14:21.228 --> 14:23.461
              You let my mom and
                dad go to jail?!

14:23.463 --> 14:26.464
Now, I know you're angry, but
try not to let that come through

14:26.466 --> 14:29.234
when you do your report
on Garbage Island, which is now!

14:29.236 --> 14:31.569
Go!
      (theme music plays)

14:31.571 --> 14:36.140
 Um... m-mo-most people like to
get wasted on an exotic island,

14:36.142 --> 14:38.810
   but this island <i>is</i> waste.

14:38.812 --> 14:39.978
            (sighs)

14:39.980 --> 14:41.579
  I'm sorry. I can't do this.

14:41.581 --> 14:42.914
      Isn't she a trouper?

14:42.916 --> 14:44.182
 Still trying to save the world

14:44.184 --> 14:45.884
    when, just moments ago,
          she learned

14:45.886 --> 14:48.319
   that her parents murdered
  her little handsome brother.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.154
   They murdered her brother!

14:50.156 --> 14:53.024
          Camera two,
   they murdered her brother!

14:53.026 --> 14:55.827
      I'm sorry. Cut! Cut!
        I can't do this!

14:55.829 --> 14:59.163
              ¶

15:00.566 --> 15:03.534
      Okay, from the top.

15:03.536 --> 15:06.070
    (whistling "Ode to Joy")

15:09.775 --> 15:11.509
                          Steve!
My orchestra!

15:11.511 --> 15:13.945
          Pack your bags, Steve.
               We're going home.

15:13.947 --> 15:16.414
      Home? Are you crazy?

15:16.416 --> 15:18.216
   "Steve Fever" is starting
           to build.

15:18.218 --> 15:19.784
 I'll be dropping more panties

15:19.786 --> 15:22.186
   than when Mr. Bean worked
     at Victoria's Secret.

15:22.188 --> 15:23.621
  Haven't you been watching?!

15:23.623 --> 15:25.290
   Mom and Dad got arrested!

15:25.292 --> 15:29.193
            Huh?!
           Yeah. This kidnapping
             is officially over.

15:29.195 --> 15:31.696
    Un... expected... twist!

15:31.698 --> 15:33.765
    It is with a heavy heart

15:33.767 --> 15:36.034
     that I must report one
     of my own journalists,

15:36.036 --> 15:38.136
         Hayley Smith,
     kidnapped her brother

15:38.138 --> 15:41.439
   and framed her own parents
        for his murder!

15:41.441 --> 15:42.573
(whispering):
Let her take the fall,

15:42.575 --> 15:43.708
or you're going down with her.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.443
    Thank God we found him!

15:45.445 --> 15:48.046
      He seems to be okay,
   at least above the waist.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.882
Steve, did she do stuff to you?

15:50.884 --> 15:52.984
       Oh, God, she did!

15:52.986 --> 15:54.218
          Camera two,

15:54.220 --> 15:55.420
                  she did!

15:55.422 --> 15:56.587
                          What?!

15:56.589 --> 15:57.822
             These are all lies!

15:57.824 --> 15:59.324
                Steve, tell them
                      the truth!

16:04.229 --> 16:06.331
Genevieve Vavance is right!

16:06.333 --> 16:07.966
My sister kidnapped me!

16:07.968 --> 16:09.267
                          Steve!

16:09.269 --> 16:10.868
      (siren approaching)

16:12.104 --> 16:13.604
        We got a runner!

16:13.606 --> 16:15.840
       You cops split up
and comb each side of the river.

16:15.842 --> 16:17.575
        Don't come back
       until you get her!

16:17.577 --> 16:19.410
                      Genevieve,
                    is that you?

16:19.412 --> 16:21.179
               It's me-- Edward.

16:21.181 --> 16:22.914
Edward? No.

16:22.916 --> 16:24.749
No, you can't be Edward.

16:24.751 --> 16:27.652
Edward weighed at least
25 pounds more than you.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.587
              I lost that weight
                 in the academy.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.189
           You look good, Genny.

16:31.191 --> 16:33.358
         I see you kept my name.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.593
Only because
it was TV-ready.

16:35.595 --> 16:37.528
I'm married
to my career now.

16:37.530 --> 16:39.731
                You always were.

16:41.934 --> 16:43.434
I got to go, Eddie.

16:43.436 --> 16:45.737
My story's leaving,
and I got to chase it.

16:48.807 --> 16:51.776
                     Hey, Sarge,
                   was that her?

16:51.778 --> 16:54.012
                   I get it now.

16:59.184 --> 17:02.086
      (door opens, closes)

17:06.191 --> 17:09.861
       Hey, you mind if I borrow
             your Metro section?

17:09.863 --> 17:12.030
 (in deep voice):
       Sure.

17:14.299 --> 17:18.669
    MALE ANNOUNCER (on TV):
 Tonight, don't miss <i>The Steve</i>
  <i>Smith Homecoming Spectacular</i>

     by universally-likable
      crooner Josh Groban!

17:30.416 --> 17:33.551
              ¶

17:33.553 --> 17:35.319
           ANNOUNCER:

     Please welcome special
   musical guest Josh Groban!

17:42.028 --> 17:43.494
    (applause and cheering)

17:43.496 --> 17:47.198
         ¶ He was lost
      but now he's found ¶

17:47.200 --> 17:50.334
        ¶ We just wanted
      to have him around ¶

17:50.336 --> 17:54.338
     ¶ He's the Steveiest,
      he's the Steveiest ¶

17:54.340 --> 17:57.208
     ¶ He's utterly Steve

17:57.210 --> 18:00.578
   ¶ Oh, Steve, in the night
      we called for you ¶
    (applause and cheering)

18:00.580 --> 18:03.748
     ¶ Steve, in the night
      we bawled for you ¶
       (audience groans)

18:03.750 --> 18:05.550
      ¶ Now you're home

18:05.552 --> 18:08.619
        ¶ Stay with us

18:08.621 --> 18:14.592
        ¶ Stay, Steve!

18:14.594 --> 18:17.195
    (applause and cheering)

18:17.197 --> 18:19.230
       And please welcome
         my dear friend

18:19.232 --> 18:21.799
      and spiritual guide,
    Miss Genevieve Vavance.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.734
    (applause and cheering,
       theme music plays)

18:23.736 --> 18:25.636
        Thanks, Grobes.
 See you next month in Mexico.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.305
  I put your name on the room,

18:27.307 --> 18:29.373
        in case you want
     to check in before me.

18:29.375 --> 18:31.943
       And now let's have
     a big welcome back for

18:31.945 --> 18:35.613
  Steve Smith and his parents,
       Stan and Francine!

18:35.615 --> 18:37.849
           (applause)

18:39.418 --> 18:40.918
Thank you
for being here.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.253
Now, let's start
with the parents.

18:42.255 --> 18:43.654
How thankful are you

18:43.656 --> 18:46.257
that my accusing you of murder
has brought an end

18:46.259 --> 18:47.391
to this terrible ordeal?

18:47.393 --> 18:49.160
On a scale
from 90 to 100.

18:49.162 --> 18:51.662
          Then... 90.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.431
      90. Wow! Still an A!

18:53.433 --> 18:56.367
           (applause)
They don't just give those out!

18:57.169 --> 18:58.302
And Steve Smith,

18:58.304 --> 19:00.771
here you are, safe, free,

19:00.773 --> 19:02.573
the nightmare
behind you.

19:02.575 --> 19:05.743
Tell us: what was it like to
be kidnapped by your own sister?

19:05.745 --> 19:07.478
           Well, I...

19:07.480 --> 19:08.479
         I'm not sure.

19:08.481 --> 19:09.814
         Is that right?

19:09.816 --> 19:12.517
          Well, maybe
   the teleprompter can help.

19:14.820 --> 19:17.522
       Um... I... Well...

19:17.524 --> 19:19.657
Uh, I had heard
that there was never a time

19:19.659 --> 19:21.325
you weren't certain
you were going to die.

19:21.327 --> 19:22.660
       (audience gasping)

19:22.662 --> 19:24.862
Every girl
in that crowd wants you.

19:24.864 --> 19:27.031
Just read the damn prompter.

19:30.202 --> 19:32.803
 "My crazy sister locked me up

19:32.805 --> 19:35.873
   and made me kiss a raccoon
        on the mouth..."

19:35.875 --> 19:37.875
            No! That's not true.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.043
                None of this is!

19:39.045 --> 19:40.778
        Wha-What-What?!

19:40.780 --> 19:42.013
                I can't do this.

19:42.015 --> 19:43.814
     My sister didn't kidnap me.

19:43.816 --> 19:46.784
  I humiliated myself at school,
          so she helped me hide.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.619
 This entire thing was staged.

19:48.621 --> 19:49.887
       (audience gasping)

19:49.889 --> 19:51.956
     And Genevieve Vavance
         was in on it.

19:51.958 --> 19:55.059
                   Yes, I staged
             Steve's kidnapping,

19:55.061 --> 19:57.128
           but Genevieve Vavance
                  knew about it.

19:57.130 --> 19:59.130
              She had my parents
            arrested for a crime

19:59.132 --> 20:00.798
                   she knew they
                  didn't commit,

20:00.800 --> 20:03.167
    and when I told her to stop,
             she framed me, too.

20:03.169 --> 20:04.902
      (audience murmuring)
        We trusted you!

20:04.904 --> 20:06.737
    You're supposed
    to be a journalist!
         (audience booing)

20:06.739 --> 20:09.740
                   I can't read!
                I depend on you!

20:09.742 --> 20:10.841
             Whoa!

20:10.843 --> 20:11.876
              Aah!

20:11.878 --> 20:14.645
    Uh, uh, everyone,
    a big hand

20:14.647 --> 20:16.380
for the BeerWater
mermaids!

20:16.382 --> 20:17.982
      (dance music plays)

20:17.984 --> 20:20.651
      (audience clamoring)

20:22.988 --> 20:25.623
          (screaming)

20:27.259 --> 20:30.494
  (gasping)

20:30.496 --> 20:33.898
Hayley, I'm sorry I let
everyone think you kidnapped me.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.199
                      No, Steve.

20:35.201 --> 20:37.001
            I'm the one who owes
                 you an apology.

20:37.003 --> 20:40.004
I just wanted to be a journalist
  and get the truth out there,

20:40.006 --> 20:43.541
  but I ended up compromising
 all my beliefs along the way.

20:43.543 --> 20:45.776
            (sighs)
      I learned my lesson.

20:45.778 --> 20:48.079
 I'll never be ambitious again.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.747
Hayley, I have no idea
what's going on,

20:49.749 --> 20:52.750
       but it sounds like
   I should be proud of you.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.552
                     That ballad
              was supposed to be

20:54.554 --> 20:56.520
        my "Candle in the Wind,"
                      you dicks!

20:56.522 --> 20:59.090
          Captioned by
   <font color="#00ffff"> Media Access Group at WGBH </font>
        <font color="#00ffff">access.wgbh.org</font>

21:02.294 --> 21:03.928
  All right, I'm gonna do the
bumpers for the next few shows.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.130
     Just keep it rollin'.
   I ain't doing this twice.

21:06.132 --> 21:08.766
   What household item could
kill you in the next half-hour?

21:08.768 --> 21:11.702
   We'll tell you tonight...
           at 11:00!

21:11.704 --> 21:13.971
       Easily surprised?
       You'll be shocked

21:13.973 --> 21:16.107
       by what you learn
       tonight at 11:00.

21:16.109 --> 21:18.442
     Texting and driving--
   how it may save your life.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.478
       Tonight at 11:00!

21:20.480 --> 21:22.113
      Is Mario Lopez gay?

21:22.115 --> 21:24.615
 We make irresponsible guesses,
       tonight at 11:00.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.817
  The results will shock him.

21:26.819 --> 21:29.987
  Tonight, at 11:00, teens are
having sex younger and younger.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.322
         Want to watch?

21:31.324 --> 21:33.524
  Bye! Have a beautiful time.
