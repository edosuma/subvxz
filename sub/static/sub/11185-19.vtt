00:01.268 --> 00:03.373
I want you to go down
there and get him out.

00:03.437 --> 00:05.144
You're talking about
someth’n that's illegal.

00:05.205 --> 00:08.186
The law shouldn't have put him
in there in the first place!

00:12.746 --> 00:14.225
Abort, Dom! Get out!

00:15.048 --> 00:18.655
You were always real good at looking out
for number 1. Looks like you still are.

00:18.785 --> 00:22.062
Who would go to such lengths to
save this simpering little gringo?

00:22.122 --> 00:24.398
I'm being watched, so let's make it fast.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073

02:21.375 --> 02:24.322
Pardon me. I'm looking for a
man named Stringfellow Hawke.

02:24.378 --> 02:27.052
Why, yes ma'am, he's right over there.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.033
Eleanor.

02:41.294 --> 02:42.602
Hello, Hawke.

02:42.963 --> 02:46.172
It's been a long time, 15 years.

02:49.202 --> 02:51.876
It shouldn't be hard for
you to remember that day.

02:51.938 --> 02:53.849
Your husband's funeral.

02:54.408 --> 02:56.854
Look Hawke, I know we've never
liked each other very much.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.651
Wasn't a matter of "like," Eleanor.

02:58.712 --> 03:01.784
Mike could’ve really been
somebody if he hadn't married you.

03:04.084 --> 03:07.998
Our son, Terry, is in a
Central American prison camp.

03:10.657 --> 03:12.398
You're my last hope, Hawke.

03:13.093 --> 03:15.164
I know you owe me
nothing less than nothing,

03:15.228 --> 03:17.674
but Mike was your best friend,

03:18.665 --> 03:22.238
and his son, Terry,
needs your help desperately.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.043
Maybe you'd better tell
us how this happened.

03:26.339 --> 03:29.548
And so this sweet girl, this pretty poison,

03:29.609 --> 03:33.523
very cleverly got Terry
framed and convicted

03:33.580 --> 03:37.027
on a “transportation of drugs” charge.

03:37.084 --> 03:41.089
He's currently serving a 14-year
prison sentence in Santa Paula.

03:42.522 --> 03:44.729
Why would this woman want to frame your son?

03:45.826 --> 03:48.033
I have a successful import business.

03:48.095 --> 03:50.473
After Terry was in prison,
the girl phoned me.

03:50.664 --> 03:54.111
She said that if her friends
could use my business

03:54.167 --> 03:56.909
to import drugs into the country,

03:56.970 --> 03:59.712
they would release, to
the Santa Paula Government,

03:59.773 --> 04:02.117
evidence that would clear Terry.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.355
What kind of evidence?

04:04.778 --> 04:07.554
They didn't tell me. I wouldn't
have believed them if they had.

04:07.614 --> 04:09.491
I don't intend to do what they want.

04:09.549 --> 04:12.155
Well, what exactly is your intention?

04:12.352 --> 04:17.630
Hawke, I've used every option
available to me, including bribery.

04:18.625 --> 04:20.764
Terry has a heart condition.

04:21.060 --> 04:23.735
He's not equipped physically or emotionally

04:23.797 --> 04:26.004
to survive in that prison camp.

04:26.066 --> 04:29.775
And he's been there 4
months already. I was there.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.547
It was indescribable.

04:34.207 --> 04:36.187
What do you really want me to do?

04:36.243 --> 04:39.087
I want you to go down there and get him out.

04:39.146 --> 04:42.457
What? Oh lady, you gotta be kidding.

04:43.416 --> 04:45.726
I'll pay you anything you want!

04:45.786 --> 04:48.733
Listen, you're talking about
something that's illegal.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.736
The law shouldn't have put him
in there in the first place!

04:54.828 --> 04:57.138
You know, I'd really like to help you, but…

04:57.197 --> 05:00.974
Hawke, you haven't seen
Terry in a long time,

05:01.301 --> 05:03.178
not since he was little.

05:03.603 --> 05:05.446
I think you'd like him.

05:05.705 --> 05:08.185
He has a lot of his Father in him.

05:13.113 --> 05:17.061
Look, String, you think we can discuss this

05:17.150 --> 05:19.187
for a few minutes in private?

05:21.955 --> 05:23.559
I'll wait outside.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.102
Thank you.

05:33.133 --> 05:36.376
For crying out loud! You're really
not going to do this, are you?

05:36.903 --> 05:39.315
This young man's Father, her husband,

05:39.372 --> 05:42.717
he and his family moved in next
door to me when I was 8 years old.

05:42.776 --> 05:46.121
We went to elementary school
together, high school.

05:46.646 --> 05:49.752
Went off to college
together. He was my partner.

05:49.816 --> 05:51.420
Until she split you up.

05:53.286 --> 05:56.733
But what she's asking for,
you'll land in the next cell.

05:57.591 --> 06:00.299
Dom, I gotta do something.
At least go look around.

06:02.362 --> 06:05.832
This is the nuttiest thing
I ever heard of in my life!

06:06.499 --> 06:09.537
But you're crazy if you think
you're gonna go down there alone.

06:10.237 --> 06:11.272
Right.

06:27.487 --> 06:30.468
Well, we're about 5 minutes
away from that prison compound.

06:30.523 --> 06:33.766
Let's land this bird and
do a quick ground recon.

06:34.027 --> 06:36.166
Those Policias see us
up here getting too nosy,

06:36.229 --> 06:38.140
they're liable to run a tracer on us.

06:38.365 --> 06:39.503
You got it.

06:57.550 --> 06:59.359
Didn't I tell you to keep him quiet?

06:59.419 --> 07:00.955
He can't help himself.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.796
His coughing’s making me angry.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.961
I'll take him to the end of the yard.

07:05.625 --> 07:08.606
Hey, he's gonna get us all sick,
man. I think he's better dead.

07:09.829 --> 07:11.502
Could you get him away from me?

07:28.281 --> 07:29.954
Sanders is crazy.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.058
He doesn't like you.

07:32.452 --> 07:35.194
Look, I just want him
kept away from me… us.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.192
Are you giving me orders?

07:37.257 --> 07:38.292
No, I just…

07:38.358 --> 07:40.736
4 months, and you haven't
learned the rules here.

07:40.794 --> 07:45.174
1st rule, you never argue with Mendez.

07:45.532 --> 07:48.877
2nd rule, Mendez holds the power.

07:50.937 --> 07:52.712
I want to speak to the Commandant.

07:52.772 --> 07:56.083
The Commandant hides in his
office and waits for his pension.

07:56.209 --> 07:58.246
Mendez is in charge here.

07:58.378 --> 08:03.191
Mendez is the power, and
now Mendez is very angry

08:03.249 --> 08:06.696
because you have not accepted that.

08:08.388 --> 08:09.765
I'm sorry.

08:10.090 --> 08:13.697
"Sorry" is that all you have to offer?

08:20.867 --> 08:22.005
Is that all you have?

08:22.068 --> 08:23.103
I can get more.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.080
Look, American dollars, cigarettes.

08:25.138 --> 08:27.982
You worry me. I don't trust you.

08:29.142 --> 08:30.917
You want to see the Commandant…

08:31.144 --> 08:32.623
I won’t. I promise.

08:33.746 --> 08:36.693
Captain Mendez, please, just leave us alone.

08:37.150 --> 08:39.926
…or cause me any trouble,
even just a little bit.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.756
I won't cause you any trouble.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.533
I'll be watching you.

09:15.221 --> 09:16.859
How do you feel?

09:19.826 --> 09:22.170
Like I was rode hard and put up wet.

09:30.670 --> 09:34.948
You, Ernesto! Come here!

09:38.445 --> 09:41.426
Hawke, you will be able
to get him out, won't you?

09:41.481 --> 09:45.588
I already told you,
Eleanor. We'll get him out.

09:59.999 --> 10:02.479
He's my son. I want to go with you.

10:02.902 --> 10:04.609
It's too risky.

10:04.671 --> 10:07.117
I've got a picture of Terry here,

10:07.907 --> 10:09.978
and ID to get in the place.

10:10.076 --> 10:12.522
We shouldn't risk any
more people than we need.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.791
Well, don't forget Terry's care package.

10:19.519 --> 10:21.931
So, you ready to go get some rest?

10:22.021 --> 10:23.694
I won't sleep.

10:24.757 --> 10:27.863
Would you walk with me,
just for a few minutes?

10:28.828 --> 10:30.102
Why not?

10:33.566 --> 10:36.012
You know, I was more than
just a little disappointed

10:36.069 --> 10:39.243
in the way that you took off out of
town right after Michael's funeral.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.012
I had to get away.

10:41.174 --> 10:44.121
Away from the memories.
Away from you, Hawke.

10:44.177 --> 10:47.522
You used to pin me with that
accusing stare of yours.

10:48.281 --> 10:53.094
So I went to San Francisco, bought
into a small import-export business,

10:53.153 --> 10:55.997
and eventually ended up running the place.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.691
Never remarried?

10:57.891 --> 11:00.497
Marriage was not one of my priorities.

11:00.560 --> 11:03.700
I had to start a new life,
build up a business.

11:06.332 --> 11:07.902
Raise a son?

11:09.135 --> 11:10.478
That's not fair.

11:13.039 --> 11:17.818
You were always real good at looking out
for number one. Looks like you still are.

11:22.148 --> 11:24.458
Don't you know there's only
one thing on this earth

11:24.517 --> 11:26.793
that would make me come
crawling back to you?

11:27.320 --> 11:28.890
And that's Terry.

11:47.540 --> 11:51.283
I remember when you thought she
was public enemy number one.

11:51.578 --> 11:53.489
Part of me still does.

11:53.980 --> 11:57.723
But when I see her again, I kind of
think I was a little hard on her.

12:00.687 --> 12:02.064
Bartender.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.241
Adelante.

12:16.569 --> 12:17.673
You sent for me?

12:17.737 --> 12:19.614
Our new prisoner, Haines…

12:20.206 --> 12:21.310
What about him?

12:21.374 --> 12:22.682
He has a visitor.

12:27.981 --> 12:28.982
Uncle?

12:32.185 --> 12:36.759
Requests for visitations have to
be made in advance, in writing.

12:38.491 --> 12:40.437
He has come a long way.

13:10.523 --> 13:11.524
Ernesto.

13:23.069 --> 13:25.606
Haines, your Uncle wants to see you.

13:26.039 --> 13:27.347
My Uncle?

13:29.442 --> 13:32.480
What's the matter? You don't
recognize me without my beard?

13:33.246 --> 13:35.749
Come on, give your old Uncle Tim a big hug.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.489
Play along with this. Your Mother sent me.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.597
Uncle Tim, what a surprise.

13:41.120 --> 13:45.398
You think we could have a private
minute here, just the 2 of us?

13:48.761 --> 13:50.069
Thanks.

13:51.431 --> 13:52.569
Who are you?

13:52.632 --> 13:53.940
Stringfellow Hawke.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.640
I'm a friend of your
Father's, and your Mother's.

13:56.703 --> 13:57.773
My Father?

13:58.137 --> 13:59.878
I'll tell you about that later.

14:00.440 --> 14:03.683
Now, listen close. We're
gonna break you out of here.

14:03.743 --> 14:04.881
You're putting me on.

14:04.944 --> 14:07.185
No. How many times a day
are you in this yard?

14:07.447 --> 14:09.393
3 times, once after each meal.

14:09.649 --> 14:11.026
What times exactly?

14:11.084 --> 14:12.825
9:00, 1:00 and 6:00.

14:18.424 --> 14:20.165
All right, tomorrow, and listen careful,

14:20.226 --> 14:23.503
tomorrow, 1:15, I'm gonna land
a helicopter right over there.

14:23.563 --> 14:25.668
Helicopter? You're serious?

14:26.165 --> 14:28.111
I'm not here 'cause I like the ambiance.

14:28.167 --> 14:30.272
Now, listen to me careful.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.817
I'll be on the ground
5 seconds, 1:15 exactly.

14:34.474 --> 14:35.976
Here he comes.

14:39.245 --> 14:40.451
You look good, boy.

14:40.513 --> 14:41.514
Thanks.

14:41.581 --> 14:42.787
I'll tell your Mother.

14:42.849 --> 14:44.453
Thanks for coming.

14:53.192 --> 14:57.265
So, Uncle Tim, what news you
gonna take out of Santa Paula?

14:57.663 --> 14:59.006
News?

14:59.632 --> 15:01.509
About your nephew.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.883
You heard, that he's well.

15:06.773 --> 15:12.519
Good. If that's what you'll
say, then he might stay well.

15:16.449 --> 15:18.429
Hey, gordo. Maybe you want your rifle

15:18.484 --> 15:20.327
while you help the American out, huh?

15:21.554 --> 15:22.828
Come here, gordo!

16:05.731 --> 16:07.404
Cate will bring the other helicopter in

16:07.467 --> 16:09.572
about a half-hour before we start.

16:10.069 --> 16:12.140
That's where you and Caitlin will stand by

16:12.205 --> 16:14.082
while we go in and get Terry.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.916
I want to go with you. I mean,
what if something goes wrong?

16:16.976 --> 16:18.284
What if he's hurt?

16:18.344 --> 16:20.688
We can handle anything like that.

16:20.746 --> 16:24.751
I need Dom to operate the in-flight
systems and be a backup pilot,

16:24.817 --> 16:26.558
or else he wouldn't even go in.

16:26.619 --> 16:29.293
I can't just sit out there in
the boondocks doing nothing.

16:29.355 --> 16:32.598
Well, String's right, ma'am.
You see, if you come along,

16:32.658 --> 16:34.865
we're just gonna have to
worry about looking after you

16:34.927 --> 16:36.429
instead of doing our real job,

16:36.496 --> 16:38.169
rescuing your son.

16:39.098 --> 16:42.705
What you say makes sense, but
I just hate feeling useless.

16:43.236 --> 16:44.909
You've got your work cut out for you

16:44.971 --> 16:46.746
once we get Terry back across the border.

16:47.073 --> 16:50.919
Sure, by tomorrow afternoon,
we'll all be home, safe and sound.

16:55.381 --> 16:57.292
To tomorrow afternoon.

17:21.507 --> 17:23.680
Now Gentry, you're coming with me.

17:23.742 --> 17:27.213
The second I tell you,
take a grab on my arm,

17:27.280 --> 17:29.419
and if there's any run left in you…

17:29.482 --> 17:32.224
There's enough run to get me outta here.

17:49.302 --> 17:50.713
How we doing on time, Dom?

17:50.770 --> 17:52.374
Right on the money.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.851
We talked it over,
and they all agree with me.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.453
He's gonna make us all get
sick, and we're all gonna die!

18:06.519 --> 18:09.363
Look, here's some cigarettes, some candy.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.869
Here's some money. Just
leave us alone, okay?

18:14.760 --> 18:17.434
Hey, we took a vote. We kill
him before he kills us.

18:17.496 --> 18:19.203
You can't kill a man for no reason.

18:19.265 --> 18:21.871
Hey, we got reason. We don't like him.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.347
And we don't like you.

18:26.238 --> 18:28.878
Maybe we should kill both of you, huh?

18:36.682 --> 18:38.662
What are you looking at, punk?

18:39.852 --> 18:42.560
You think Mendez cares? He doesn't care.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.960
He doesn't like you, either.

18:45.558 --> 18:50.371
I got a good idea. You kill
him in bed tonight. Choke him.

18:51.163 --> 18:53.404
So I don't have to touch him.

18:53.933 --> 18:57.142
Okay, okay, I'll do it.
Just leave us alone, okay?

18:58.304 --> 19:00.978
Come on, man. You ain't
got the stomach for it.

19:01.040 --> 19:05.113
Morales, you got strong hands.
Get him out of his misery.

19:06.045 --> 19:08.082
No, you can't do this.

19:27.933 --> 19:29.708
Gentry, come on. That's Hawke.

19:34.974 --> 19:36.351
Where the hell is he?

19:38.044 --> 19:40.786
He can't get to us, Dom.
I'm gonna go after him.

19:41.213 --> 19:42.590
No, String!

19:48.087 --> 19:49.794
You've got to try.

19:53.526 --> 19:54.937
Abort, Dom! Get out!

19:55.494 --> 19:58.338
Get out! I'm not gonna make it! Abort!

20:14.780 --> 20:18.751
Well, Uncle Tim, welcome back home.

20:20.553 --> 20:23.033
This time you'll be staying longer.

20:48.647 --> 20:49.785
So,

20:51.484 --> 20:53.987
you still think you're Haines' Uncle.

20:56.255 --> 20:57.700
I think not.

21:01.327 --> 21:05.002
I don't like to talk to
myself. Make me feel lonely.

21:08.067 --> 21:11.207
Maybe if you found some manners,
you might have more friends.

21:15.107 --> 21:19.647
Your aircraft look very expensive.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.523
Very modern.

21:22.414 --> 21:26.328
That tells me Haines is well
connected, as you Americans say.

21:28.053 --> 21:29.498
Now, that worries me.

21:32.091 --> 21:33.092
It should.

21:38.230 --> 21:39.573
It's so unfair.

21:40.533 --> 21:45.607
Just a poor, small Civil
Servant, doing my job.

21:47.273 --> 21:52.621
I don't want to become the
victim of… what? Politics?

21:56.382 --> 21:59.852
Who would go to such lengths to
save this simpering little gringo?

22:03.656 --> 22:05.761
People in high places, huh?

22:14.967 --> 22:17.345
Well, I'm gonna keep you here for a while.

22:18.737 --> 22:19.977
Till your trial.

22:21.740 --> 22:24.949
Maybe I can persuade you
to be more talkative.

22:51.103 --> 22:55.051
You 3 are so attached to each
other, you should be together.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.668
You don't look so good.

23:12.024 --> 23:14.436
I got noth’n to say to you, kid.

23:17.763 --> 23:20.539
Listen, I'm sorry it all went sour.

23:23.435 --> 23:27.611
Sorry, hell. You hung me out to dry.

23:57.169 --> 23:59.206
Okay, I got you guys
checked outta your rooms,

23:59.271 --> 24:01.114
and I covered your tracks.

24:01.173 --> 24:04.211
Dom, you think maybe we should
contact the Firm for some help?

24:04.343 --> 24:06.949
Are you kidding? That's too risky, Cate.

24:07.046 --> 24:09.959
What we're doing here is absolutely illegal.

24:11.116 --> 24:13.619
I mean, we're way out on a long limb here.

24:13.686 --> 24:15.893
Then what, what are we going to do?

24:16.188 --> 24:18.634
We're gonna get ourselves out, and fast.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.136
You know, it's not gonna take much checking

24:20.192 --> 24:22.365
to know that those Anglos with
the helicopter were involved

24:22.428 --> 24:23.736
with that rescue attempt.

24:23.796 --> 24:25.036
Oh, God.

24:26.198 --> 24:29.179
Terry was holding the wolves
at bay before this happened.

24:29.234 --> 24:31.236
Can you imagine what he's going through now?

24:31.303 --> 24:33.374
Don't you mean what they're going through?

24:33.439 --> 24:36.909
Oh Cate, you know I mean Hawke, too.

24:38.510 --> 24:40.820
I've gotta get into that prison.

24:41.113 --> 24:42.615
Yeah, but how?

24:42.982 --> 24:47.431
They're not gonna want to see another one
of Terry's Uncles or Hawke's friends.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.022
I know. I know.

24:49.855 --> 24:52.802
I can't go in there to see them specifically.

24:53.492 --> 24:58.100
Once I got in, I'd have to make
it appear like it was incidental.

24:58.163 --> 24:59.574
You know what I mean?

24:59.965 --> 25:01.171
You mean we?

25:02.334 --> 25:04.644
We? Come on, Cate.

25:05.104 --> 25:08.017
It's hard enough for a man
to get in there, but a woman?

25:21.220 --> 25:23.757
And you say you are from where?

25:23.822 --> 25:27.133
Lucia de la Santini, north di Napoli.

25:27.593 --> 25:28.697
Italy?

25:28.761 --> 25:30.468
Si. Yes.

25:31.497 --> 25:33.170
So far from home?

25:33.966 --> 25:36.412
Well, the whole world is our home,

25:36.902 --> 25:39.940
and everybody in the
whole world is our family.

25:40.773 --> 25:43.310
And you are here to do what, exactly?

25:43.609 --> 25:49.059
We have come to plant the seeds
of love with our fratelli.

25:50.115 --> 25:53.187
There are more stones
than seeds in this place.

25:53.585 --> 25:56.828
Which means they must need us very much.

25:57.890 --> 26:00.996
Father, I don't mind your visiting us,

26:01.560 --> 26:05.337
but I can't send a young woman
like this into a prison yard.

26:05.397 --> 26:06.933
Begging your pardon, sir,

26:06.999 --> 26:08.842
but I'm no young woman. I'm a nun.

26:08.901 --> 26:12.576
I've naught to fear from the likes
of them that are incarcerated here.

26:12.638 --> 26:14.777
I thought you were both from Italy.

26:14.840 --> 26:17.013
- Si.
- So we are. Yes, indeed.

26:17.076 --> 26:19.920
Well, you see, I came to Naples 3 years ago,

26:19.978 --> 26:22.618
for, you see, Ireland is the
only country in the world

26:22.681 --> 26:25.355
that produces more nuns
and Priests than it needs.

26:25.484 --> 26:28.488
Catholic clergy are Ireland's
largest export, don't you know?

26:28.554 --> 26:30.158
We're all over the world.

26:30.222 --> 26:32.224
But this is a prison, Sister.

26:32.291 --> 26:35.067
Some of these men have not
seen a woman in years.

26:35.127 --> 26:39.200
But don't you know, I was the
only girl raised among 8 brothers.

26:39.331 --> 26:41.038
I can take care of meself.

26:41.100 --> 26:44.274
But if you're worried,
I'm sure this fine gentleman

26:44.336 --> 26:47.249
would escort me and preserve me from harm.

26:47.739 --> 26:49.377
Wouldn't you, now?

26:51.043 --> 26:52.750
See to it, Mendez, eh?

26:53.112 --> 26:54.591
Yes, Commandant.

26:54.813 --> 26:58.192
I would like to have a talk
with you first, privately.

26:59.351 --> 27:01.262
Scusi, eh? Scusi.

27:08.193 --> 27:10.935
Concerning that incident yesterday…

27:11.563 --> 27:13.634
Yes, I'm writing a report.

27:13.866 --> 27:15.174
I was thinking.

27:15.234 --> 27:19.114
You were looking for an excuse to
go to the capital for a few days.

27:19.171 --> 27:20.548
Yes.

27:21.106 --> 27:22.312
Yes.

27:22.374 --> 27:25.548
I could report the incident
personally, could I not?

27:25.611 --> 27:26.715
Why not?

27:26.778 --> 27:28.689
Yes, why not?

28:14.493 --> 28:16.632
Hand me the candy bar, kid.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.634
Well, he speaks.

28:20.832 --> 28:22.743
Give me the chocolate.

29:17.889 --> 29:19.835
I know you're not too thrilled with me,

29:19.891 --> 29:22.895
but giving the candy
away was a little petty.

29:24.963 --> 29:27.910
Look, I can't change
what happened yesterday.

29:28.867 --> 29:31.677
You sure as hell could have prevented it.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.674
Look, they were about to kill Gentry.

29:33.739 --> 29:36.242
I had to try to get him outta here.

29:37.376 --> 29:40.016
You shouldn't have changed
signals without tell’n us.

29:40.846 --> 29:42.883
Listen, there are some
real crazies in there,

29:42.948 --> 29:44.894
and they're afraid that
Gentry's gonna infect them.

29:44.950 --> 29:47.556
They've threatened to kill him and me.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.428
They just threatened you. You caved in.

29:49.488 --> 29:51.434
Okay, so I'm not a hero.

29:51.957 --> 29:54.904
You know kid, I never
asked you to be a hero,

29:55.294 --> 29:57.934
but I did expect you to
live up to your agreement.

29:58.363 --> 30:00.070
Maybe you expected too much.

30:00.399 --> 30:02.242
Well, let's put it this way.

30:02.501 --> 30:05.380
You're not what I expected
of your Father's son.

30:05.537 --> 30:07.517
That's the second time
you've mentioned my Father.

30:07.572 --> 30:08.642
Yeah, it'll be the last.

30:08.707 --> 30:09.708
Meaning what?

30:29.461 --> 30:31.839
I'm being watched, so let's make it fast.

30:31.897 --> 30:35.572
1st, to keep the wolves at bay.

30:39.905 --> 30:43.478
2nd, any more brilliant ideas?

30:45.077 --> 30:47.489
How about no more frontal assaults?

30:48.013 --> 30:49.253
Agreed.

30:52.451 --> 30:54.453
Listen, I've got an idea.

30:54.720 --> 30:56.324
I'm gonna need some cover.

30:56.421 --> 30:57.764
Well, speak, brother.

30:57.956 --> 31:00.266
May the Lord bless you and keep you.

31:02.894 --> 31:04.532
May the Lord bless you and keep you.

31:04.596 --> 31:08.976
Hey Sis, I think I need some personal
counseling. How about it, huh?

31:12.537 --> 31:14.642
Show some respect, Sanders.

31:15.006 --> 31:17.077
She's under my protection.

31:17.642 --> 31:19.212
Or it's the hotbox.

31:19.277 --> 31:20.620
It's all right.

31:20.679 --> 31:22.681
There's no need to be defending me,

31:22.748 --> 31:25.251
just please forgive him as I forgive him.

31:34.159 --> 31:37.038
What a fine figure you cut
in that uniform, Captain.

31:37.095 --> 31:38.802
That shirt, it's so beautiful.

31:38.864 --> 31:41.868
It wouldn't by any chance be
Irish linen, now would it?

31:41.933 --> 31:43.241
I think not.

31:43.335 --> 31:45.110
Oh! More's the pity.

31:52.444 --> 31:53.548
Any questions?

31:53.612 --> 31:55.250
No, I'll take care of it.

31:56.581 --> 31:59.255
The timing's gotta be perfect, so remember,

31:59.684 --> 32:03.131
those lights go on exactly
one half-hour before sunset.

32:04.222 --> 32:06.498
I'll be there. Until tomorrow.

32:08.460 --> 32:09.734
Go in peace, Padre.

32:09.861 --> 32:10.862
Yeah, sure.

32:12.864 --> 32:15.538
Bless you, my children. Bless you.

32:16.001 --> 32:19.972
Thank you for allowing us
to tend to our flock.

32:21.072 --> 32:23.678
What is your interest in those 3?

32:24.376 --> 32:25.616
Signore?

32:26.111 --> 32:28.318
You were a long time with them.

32:29.915 --> 32:33.260
Well, they seemed to be in need.

32:34.419 --> 32:36.262
Americanos, you know.

32:37.823 --> 32:38.995
I see.

32:39.057 --> 32:41.264
I think your time for
visitation is over, Padre.

32:41.326 --> 32:43.567
Grazie. Thank you, thank you.

32:43.628 --> 32:44.936
- Addio.
- Thank you.

32:45.297 --> 32:46.503
Addio.

32:46.565 --> 32:47.805
Come along, Sister. Tempus fugit.

32:47.866 --> 32:48.867
Ernesto.

32:49.434 --> 32:50.936
Addio.

32:53.605 --> 32:56.017
Thank you, my son. And bless you.

33:02.647 --> 33:04.149
Hey, hey…

33:04.516 --> 33:06.427
Careful, he'll see you.

33:06.485 --> 33:09.227
If he sees that, your friends
aren't gonna get out of here alive.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.368
Get him inside.

33:25.237 --> 33:27.148
I said, get him inside!

33:39.150 --> 33:41.323
Always try to pay my own way.

34:02.140 --> 34:03.813
Thursday morning,

34:04.109 --> 34:07.318
the Commandant leaves
for the capital at San Luis.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.827
By the time he returns,

34:12.650 --> 34:17.862
if you haven't told me who you
are, who sent you and why,

34:20.625 --> 34:23.003
the Comandante will find you all

34:23.094 --> 34:25.130
the unfortunate victims of violence.

34:28.900 --> 34:31.574
Do you believe I'm serious, Uncle Tim?

34:32.070 --> 34:33.606
Oh, yes sir.

34:34.039 --> 34:36.610
You're not a man to be taken lightly.

34:37.275 --> 34:40.119
Especially… when I feel threatened.

34:57.729 --> 34:59.538
Is that your fan?

34:59.764 --> 35:00.765
Yeah.

35:01.166 --> 35:02.975
Paid $100 for it.

35:04.469 --> 35:06.073
That's too bad.

35:08.473 --> 35:10.350
I'm gonna have to take it.

35:11.476 --> 35:14.514
I don't suppose you trust me
enough to tell me what you're doing.

35:14.579 --> 35:15.649
No.

35:18.416 --> 35:21.226
I did screw everything up.

35:30.795 --> 35:34.265
Gentry was tell’n me about
how you tried to save him.

35:41.406 --> 35:42.783
I owed him.

35:45.443 --> 35:47.616
My first 2 weeks here were a nightmare.

35:47.679 --> 35:50.387
I was a basket case, a walking dead man.

35:52.283 --> 35:54.263
Gentry took me aside and he showed me

35:54.319 --> 35:56.595
how he survived here for almost 10 years.

36:01.026 --> 36:03.006
I wouldn't call that surviving.

36:06.631 --> 36:08.304
You know what he does?

36:09.034 --> 36:12.572
He's got himself a few acres
of scrub-land in west Texas.

36:13.738 --> 36:16.048
He builds himself a ranch there,

36:17.175 --> 36:18.950
up here in his mind.

36:20.345 --> 36:22.791
Where the fences go,
how big to build a barn,

36:23.715 --> 36:25.422
what color the horses are.

36:25.717 --> 36:28.596
I figured maybe if I got him out with me…

36:29.154 --> 36:31.532
You'd get him back to Texas, huh?

36:33.358 --> 36:35.463
Well, you might still be able to.

36:36.161 --> 36:38.107
We better get outta here somehow,

36:38.163 --> 36:40.074
'cause I'm sure not stay’n.

36:40.198 --> 36:41.302
How?

36:41.366 --> 36:42.868
I got a plan.

36:43.268 --> 36:45.407
What kinda physical shape you in?

36:45.503 --> 36:47.483
Your Mother told me about your condition.

36:47.539 --> 36:48.882
Condition?

36:50.075 --> 36:51.554
Your heart.

36:52.377 --> 36:54.288
There's nothing wrong with my heart.

36:54.979 --> 36:56.219
There's nothing wrong with my heart.

36:56.281 --> 36:58.852
I had a little touch of
rheumatic fever when I was a kid.

36:58.917 --> 37:00.225
That faded years ago.

37:02.487 --> 37:05.730
In case you hadn't noticed, my
Mother is a bright and clever lady.

37:05.790 --> 37:07.326
But you have to dance to her tune.

37:07.392 --> 37:08.462
She gets it her way,

37:08.526 --> 37:10.972
even if it means bending the
truth a little sometimes.

37:12.597 --> 37:14.167
And you've been dancing.

37:16.201 --> 37:17.407
All my life.

37:20.839 --> 37:23.115
I've sometimes wondered,

37:23.174 --> 37:25.085
was my Father like her?

37:28.780 --> 37:32.318
Your Father was one of my very best friends.

37:33.618 --> 37:35.427
He was the greatest.

37:35.520 --> 37:37.295
He was a really stand-up guy.

37:37.956 --> 37:39.799
You'd have liked him.

37:42.360 --> 37:43.896
He'd have liked you.

38:40.084 --> 38:43.463
Buenas dias, señor.
Do you speaks the English?

38:43.521 --> 38:45.432
Si, si. Muy good.

38:45.490 --> 38:46.867
Oh, good, good, good!

38:46.925 --> 38:50.600
Para su… mi amigo y me lost. Losto?

38:57.535 --> 38:59.378
I love you, mama!

39:00.071 --> 39:01.345
Hey, come on baby!

39:01.406 --> 39:03.511
Hey baby, I'll treat you so good…

39:03.575 --> 39:06.488
You know Paradisio Hills?

39:07.078 --> 39:08.853
Paradise Hills Resort?

39:09.080 --> 39:10.753
Do you think he understands me?

39:10.949 --> 39:12.326
Hey, back off man!

39:14.152 --> 39:16.154
Hey sweetheart, hey
come on, give me a kiss.

39:16.221 --> 39:17.461
Hello!

39:38.476 --> 39:40.080
Oh. Oh, excuse me. I'm sorry.

39:40.144 --> 39:42.090
We've taken too much of your time already.

39:42.146 --> 39:43.853
Let's amscray.

39:43.915 --> 39:45.622
Mucho gracias, señor.

39:45.683 --> 39:48.493
It's okay, kiddos. You muy hot stuff.

39:48.853 --> 39:50.890
Oh, you too. Bye-bye.

39:50.955 --> 39:52.298
Bye.

39:52.357 --> 39:54.200
Don't go, baby! Don't go!

39:54.259 --> 39:55.397
Bye!

39:55.593 --> 39:56.594
Bye.

40:19.817 --> 40:21.296
There's trouble.

40:21.352 --> 40:23.491
The lights are gonna come on soon.

40:23.554 --> 40:25.056
I got an idea.

40:41.372 --> 40:43.318
What are you doing here?

40:46.077 --> 40:47.385
Just dreaming.

40:50.014 --> 40:51.618
Get back with the others.

40:55.553 --> 40:57.089
You know, I…

40:57.789 --> 41:00.531
I was thinking about what
you told me the other night.

41:00.591 --> 41:02.070
I meant what I said.

41:05.496 --> 41:07.134
I'm sure you did.

41:08.366 --> 41:10.312
And you've decided to tell me?

41:16.307 --> 41:18.344
Colonel Mendez! I'm dying!

41:18.409 --> 41:20.013
I'm busted inside!

43:42.687 --> 43:43.927
What do you say, Cate?

43:43.988 --> 43:46.400
All aboard. Let's go home, Dom.

44:08.346 --> 44:09.347
Hi.

44:10.548 --> 44:12.289
I don't know what to say to you.

44:13.017 --> 44:15.054
You don't gotta say anything.

44:15.186 --> 44:16.631
He was worth saving.

44:16.754 --> 44:19.428
Well, thanks to you, I spoke
to Mr. Coldsmith Briggs,

44:19.490 --> 44:22.471
and he feels he can help
clear Terry of his conviction

44:22.527 --> 44:24.803
and punish the people responsible.

44:25.863 --> 44:29.037
Yeah, Michael can usually do
anything he puts his mind to.

44:29.100 --> 44:30.875
It's gonna take some time, though.

44:31.035 --> 44:32.912
Yes, that's what he said.

44:35.640 --> 44:37.551
Well Terry, we must go.

44:37.675 --> 44:40.155
Hawke and I are gonna fly Gentry to Texas.

44:40.244 --> 44:42.053
No, no, that's out of the question.

44:42.113 --> 44:44.150
Gentry's a friend of mine.

44:44.215 --> 44:45.956
I'll be with String.

44:48.619 --> 44:50.155
What do you say?

44:51.522 --> 44:53.763
Well, I wouldn't mind the company.

44:53.858 --> 44:56.930
In fact, he kind of reminds me
of an old friend I had one time.

44:59.163 --> 45:00.801
Well, all right.

45:03.134 --> 45:05.273
Phone me when you get there.

45:19.717 --> 45:21.560
Thanks for everything.

45:22.620 --> 45:25.066
All these years, and I
was so wrong about you.

45:27.458 --> 45:30.405
We got a lot of catch’n
up to do one of these days.

45:38.669 --> 45:40.649
She actually treated me like an adult.

45:40.705 --> 45:43.447
Yeah, now you gotta live up to it.

45:43.941 --> 45:45.249
Come on.

45:45.309 --> 45:49.382
Pull up your bootstraps and tuck in
your shirt. We're flying to Texas.

45:49.580 --> 45:51.491
And there's no speed limits up there.

45:51.549 --> 45:54.723
Good, 'cause I've had
plenty of law enforcement

45:54.785 --> 45:56.128
for one lifetime.

45:56.187 --> 45:58.463
All right.
