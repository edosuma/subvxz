00:25.025 --> 00:26.890
Thank you.

00:26.926 --> 00:28.860
Well, I'd like to thank
our own Mr. Pruit

00:28.895 --> 00:30.692
for an incredible
unplugged evening.

00:30.730 --> 00:32.925
It's his last here
before heading off

00:32.966 --> 00:35.161
to cut his own very first album.

00:35.201 --> 00:38.102
So, uh, from all of us, Ray...

00:38.138 --> 00:39.901
don't forget us
and good luck, okay?

00:39.939 --> 00:41.406
Thanks. I won't.

00:46.880 --> 00:49.371
Did you tell Kelly yet
about the weekend?

00:50.950 --> 00:53.111
Not yet.

00:53.153 --> 00:55.212
What, what? We're still
driving up, aren't we?

00:55.255 --> 00:57.155
Yeah, yeah, I got my dad

00:57.190 --> 00:59.021
to lend us his station wagon
for the drive.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.924
Oh, cool, how long
of a trip is it?

01:00.960 --> 01:01.949
It's, like, five hours.

01:02.028 --> 01:03.461
But the spa will be worth it.

01:03.496 --> 01:06.556
The brochure offers
a stress-free slice of heaven.

01:06.599 --> 01:08.863
Uh, I don't exactly know

01:08.902 --> 01:12.668
if it'll be stress-free,
but... it'll be fun.

01:12.705 --> 01:14.639
Why won't it be stress-free?

01:14.674 --> 01:17.768
Well, my advice is
tell your parents

01:17.811 --> 01:20.405
you need a lot more money
and then let Jim whittle you...

01:20.447 --> 01:22.506
Nat, I made a house budget.

01:22.549 --> 01:23.516
I went over it.

01:23.550 --> 01:24.778
I have to deal with it.

01:24.818 --> 01:26.217
Hey, Bran,

01:26.252 --> 01:29.483
come on over here,
I want you to meet somebody.

01:29.522 --> 01:31.490
Brandon Walsh.
Johnnie Mars.

01:31.524 --> 01:33.082
Location scout extraordinaire.

01:33.126 --> 01:34.991
Nice to meet you. Steve's been
talking about you all week.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.426
Well, same here.

01:36.463 --> 01:38.090
Hey, loved your house.

01:38.131 --> 01:40.156
It's exactly what the
director's looking for.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.792
- It's perfect for the film.
- Great.

01:41.835 --> 01:43.393
He wants to book
your house today.

01:43.436 --> 01:44.733
$1,200 a day.

01:44.771 --> 01:45.999
What do I have to do?

01:46.039 --> 01:47.199
Just sign right here.

01:49.509 --> 01:52.000
How could you have
invited Valerie?

01:52.078 --> 01:53.807
I'm stressed out
just thinking about it.

01:53.847 --> 01:54.905
What was I gonna do?

01:54.948 --> 01:55.972
She found out
we were going.

01:56.015 --> 01:57.277
- What could I say?
- How about "no."

01:57.317 --> 01:58.648
I mean, just because she exists,

01:58.685 --> 02:00.380
doesn't mean
she has to be included.

02:00.420 --> 02:02.445
I know, I know, but Donna
wanted her to come, too,

02:02.489 --> 02:04.480
so, I don't know,
I just thought it would be okay.

02:04.524 --> 02:06.424
- Is that so?
- Kel, it won't be

02:06.459 --> 02:08.120
that bad, I promise, okay?

02:08.161 --> 02:10.253
Besides, do you really
want to leave Valerie

02:10.295 --> 02:11.456
alone in town with Colin?

02:11.498 --> 02:13.659
I would've taken my
chances, thank you.

02:15.368 --> 02:16.426
Too late.

02:16.469 --> 02:17.629
Hey.

02:17.670 --> 02:19.228
So that road trip
we're going on

02:19.272 --> 02:20.330
sounds like fun,
huh, Kel?

02:20.373 --> 02:22.898
Hmm?

03:40.587 --> 03:41.918
Hi.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.980
Is it a bad time?

03:44.090 --> 03:46.786
No, I was just packing up.

03:46.826 --> 03:48.623
The girls will be here
any minute.

03:51.864 --> 03:54.662
I, uh, I just wanted
to return your notes.

03:54.701 --> 03:56.259
They helped me a lot.
Thanks.

03:56.302 --> 03:58.167
Well, I knew you
could catch up.

03:58.204 --> 04:01.731
Hey, listen, uh,
jean jacket or parka?

04:01.774 --> 04:02.798
Probably both.

04:02.842 --> 04:04.469
It gets kind of
cold there at night.

04:06.646 --> 04:08.375
You know, I have to admit

04:08.414 --> 04:10.109
I'm really looking
forward to this.

04:10.149 --> 04:13.915
I'm actually kind of surprised
you got invited.

04:13.953 --> 04:17.149
Well, I kind of invited myself.

04:17.190 --> 04:18.918
Getting out of town

04:18.958 --> 04:22.291
may give Kelly and me
a chance to mend some fences.

04:23.930 --> 04:24.954
Look,

04:24.998 --> 04:27.330
Val...

04:29.936 --> 04:35.568
you helped me through some real
dark hours last week and, uh...

04:35.608 --> 04:38.338
I just want you to know that
I, I really appreciate it.

04:38.378 --> 04:39.936
Thanks.

04:39.979 --> 04:44.439
Well, you don't have
to thank me.

04:44.484 --> 04:46.952
You know, I've been
thinking about you, too.

04:48.421 --> 04:50.753
And, David...

05:01.134 --> 05:03.034
Have a good time.

05:03.069 --> 05:05.060
See you when you get back.

05:55.988 --> 05:58.422
Dylan.

05:58.458 --> 06:00.619
Good, you remember
my name.

06:00.660 --> 06:02.685
And you still remember
where to find me

06:02.729 --> 06:04.390
on Friday mornings.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.400
Yes, I sure do.

06:14.774 --> 06:16.264
What's this?

06:16.309 --> 06:18.937
It's just...

06:19.011 --> 06:21.036
it's my way of apologizing.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.947
You've been giving me the
brush-off for a couple of days,

06:24.016 --> 06:25.950
so I know I did something.

06:26.018 --> 06:27.417
Yeah, you did.

06:29.389 --> 06:33.086
Well, what is it?

06:33.126 --> 06:34.684
I mean...

06:34.727 --> 06:37.127
give it to me straight;
I can take it.

06:37.163 --> 06:38.562
Okay.

06:38.598 --> 06:41.192
The other night
at my dinner party...

06:41.234 --> 06:43.293
why were you snooping
in my father's study?

06:43.336 --> 06:44.928
- That's what this is about?
- Mm.

06:44.971 --> 06:47.439
Well, it was just curiosity.

06:47.473 --> 06:49.566
- I mean, it got
the better of me. - Look...

06:49.609 --> 06:52.134
if you respect me,
you'll respect my father,

06:52.178 --> 06:54.510
our home and our privacy.

06:54.547 --> 06:56.139
Dylan, that's important to me.

06:56.182 --> 06:58.810
Well, if it's important to you,
it's important to me, too.

07:02.755 --> 07:05.121
How did you know
that I like teddy bears?

07:05.158 --> 07:07.786
Oh, it was easy... I was
snooping in your closet.

07:13.499 --> 07:14.761
Will you pass the pretzels?

07:14.801 --> 07:15.859
Oh, yeah.

07:15.902 --> 07:18.132
Okay, let's get
back to the game.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.934
New category.

07:20.039 --> 07:21.802
Best pretzels.

07:21.841 --> 07:23.638
Saltless.

07:23.676 --> 07:24.734
Regular.

07:24.777 --> 07:26.404
With mustard and cheese.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.811
All of the above.

07:27.847 --> 07:29.712
Pass 'em back up here.

07:29.749 --> 07:31.148
Thank you.
Okay...

07:31.184 --> 07:32.549
Best beach.

07:32.585 --> 07:34.951
Mm... Station eight,
Santa Monica.

07:35.021 --> 07:36.682
No, too many
high schoolers.

07:36.722 --> 07:38.815
Paradise Cove
after Labor Day.

07:38.858 --> 07:40.621
Oh, that is the best beach.

07:40.660 --> 07:42.287
I had my best kiss there.

07:42.328 --> 07:43.295
Ooh, I like.

07:43.329 --> 07:44.728
Who with?

07:44.764 --> 07:46.698
Oh, we're not up
to that category yet.

07:48.334 --> 07:50.131
Clare, where are you going?

07:50.169 --> 07:51.761
I'm just gonna take
a little shortcut.

07:51.804 --> 07:53.135
Are you sure you know
where you're going?

07:53.172 --> 07:54.264
Yeah, David and I

07:54.307 --> 07:55.774
took this road last year
when we came up here

07:55.808 --> 07:58.402
looking for UFO's, remember?

07:58.444 --> 08:00.605
Wait.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.511
On my map,
it's just a dotted line.

08:02.548 --> 08:04.015
Yeah, but just for,
like, ten miles.

08:04.050 --> 08:06.018
Back to my
favorite category.

08:06.052 --> 08:07.451
Best kiss...
Kel, who with?

08:07.487 --> 08:08.749
Not gonna tell you.

08:08.788 --> 08:10.722
I know who it was.
Who?

08:10.756 --> 08:13.350
That girl, Alison.

08:13.392 --> 08:15.292
Oh, it was not!

08:15.328 --> 08:16.352
Then tell.

08:16.395 --> 08:17.794
Come on, no secrets
on this trip.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.263
That's right, no secrets.

08:19.298 --> 08:20.925
All right, fine.
It was Dylan.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.126
Really?

08:22.168 --> 08:23.260
Not Brandon or Colin?

08:23.302 --> 08:26.601
Well, Brandon wins
for consistency,

08:26.639 --> 08:29.199
and Colin wins
for intensity, but...

08:29.242 --> 08:31.802
nothing will beat that night
on the beach with Dylan.

08:31.844 --> 08:34.745
Okay, who's next?

08:34.780 --> 08:35.940
Best kiss.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.505
Um, for me, David.

08:37.549 --> 08:39.073
Yeah, me, too.
David Silver.

08:39.118 --> 08:40.278
What about you, Valerie?

08:40.318 --> 08:42.082
Was it Brandon,

08:42.121 --> 08:45.147
Dylan, Steve, Colin, um...

08:49.929 --> 08:53.092
David.

08:53.132 --> 08:54.292
You kissed David?

08:54.333 --> 08:55.732
Just once.

08:55.768 --> 08:56.962
When?

08:57.036 --> 08:58.333
This morning.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.395
Well, don't stop now.

08:59.438 --> 09:00.928
Come on,
let's hear it.

09:00.973 --> 09:02.668
I don't think
I want to hear any more.

09:02.708 --> 09:03.732
Next category.

09:03.776 --> 09:05.676
Um...

09:05.711 --> 09:08.271
favorite cartoon
characters?

09:12.919 --> 09:14.910
Thanks for fixing
the chandelier, Ray.

09:14.954 --> 09:16.615
I want everything shipshape
for the movie crew.

09:16.656 --> 09:18.920
Whether they need it or not,
we'll be ready for 'em.

09:18.991 --> 09:21.323
All right,
stereo system's all set.

09:21.360 --> 09:22.691
Quad speakers, the works.

09:22.728 --> 09:23.922
Yes. Thanks, Silver.

09:24.030 --> 09:26.521
So are we going to get
to meet any stars or what?

09:26.566 --> 09:28.534
Uh... I don't think so.

09:30.703 --> 09:33.171
Look, I'll level with you guys.

09:33.205 --> 09:35.799
They're making a...

09:35.841 --> 09:38.833
an art film, you know?

09:38.878 --> 09:39.867
No, not exactly.

09:39.912 --> 09:40.936
What's an art film?

09:41.047 --> 09:43.277
Take a wild, wild...

09:43.316 --> 09:45.250
wild guess.

09:46.352 --> 09:47.546
I give up.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.611
Don't disappoint me, Silver.

09:48.654 --> 09:51.054
They're shooting
a skin flick here?

09:51.090 --> 09:52.421
Not a skin flick.

09:52.458 --> 09:56.224
Cinematic software for the adult
entertainment industry.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.524
- Oh, a porno.
- For real?

09:57.563 --> 09:58.587
They're gonna shoot it here?

09:59.699 --> 10:01.098
And Brandon okayed this?

10:01.133 --> 10:03.124
Well, I haven't exactly
gotten around

10:03.169 --> 10:04.864
to telling him
about that part yet.

10:06.138 --> 10:07.867
He'll be fine.

10:07.907 --> 10:10.569
Steve says they're going to be
filming at the house till late,

10:10.610 --> 10:12.669
so I figure we should
go have an early meal

10:12.712 --> 10:13.906
and then go over and watch.

10:13.946 --> 10:14.970
What do you say?

10:15.081 --> 10:17.242
Thanks, but no thanks.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.511
You're not working tonight.

10:18.551 --> 10:19.984
Why don't you
come over and hang?

10:20.052 --> 10:21.849
Didn't I just
politely decline?

10:21.887 --> 10:24.151
Which word was unclear?

10:24.190 --> 10:26.351
We could be extras?

10:26.392 --> 10:28.326
Been there, done that,
bought the T-shirt.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.295
That's right, I forgot.

10:30.329 --> 10:33.457
Miss Sophisticated
has seen everything.

10:33.499 --> 10:35.126
Except my house.

10:35.167 --> 10:36.930
What's so special
about your house, anyway?

10:36.969 --> 10:38.368
Nothing special about my house.

10:38.404 --> 10:40.599
It's just a Spanish split-
level in Beverly Hills,

10:40.640 --> 10:42.631
but you know,
I just want you to be

10:42.675 --> 10:44.438
part of my life,
is that so wrong?

10:44.477 --> 10:46.707
Look, I'm just
a little embarrassed

10:46.746 --> 10:48.907
to tell you what I'm really
doing tonight, that's all.

10:48.948 --> 10:51.382
You know, I have a sister.

10:51.417 --> 10:54.113
If this is a feminine hygiene
problem, I can handle it.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.348
I may even be able to help
you out a little bit with it.

10:56.389 --> 10:59.222
Hardly.

10:59.258 --> 11:00.850
I'm fourth in a bridge game

11:00.893 --> 11:02.155
at my great-aunt's house
in Toluca Lake,

11:02.194 --> 11:03.627
and I can't get out of it, okay?

11:03.663 --> 11:04.925
Family obligations.

11:04.964 --> 11:06.363
Why didn't you just say
so in the first place?

11:06.399 --> 11:10.062
Because it's so... uncool.

11:10.102 --> 11:12.366
Yeah, it's uncool, but
it's kinda cute, too.

11:12.405 --> 11:14.669
Don't worry, I won't
tell anybody, I swear.

11:14.707 --> 11:16.140
Thanks.

11:16.175 --> 11:17.369
You're welcome.

11:21.180 --> 11:22.977
See you tomorrow.
Okay.

11:28.821 --> 11:31.153
Clare, where are we?

11:31.190 --> 11:32.418
Relax. We're right
where we should be.

11:32.458 --> 11:34.449
Okay, I've got one.

11:34.493 --> 11:36.188
No holds barred.

11:36.228 --> 11:37.695
Best song to make out to.

11:37.730 --> 11:38.924
Anything by Barry White.

11:38.964 --> 11:40.556
Barry White?!

11:40.599 --> 11:42.294
He's, like, old.

11:42.334 --> 11:43.631
He's, like, fat.

11:43.669 --> 11:44.931
He's, like, cool.

11:44.970 --> 11:46.665
Everybody in New York
is listening to him.

11:46.706 --> 11:47.866
That voice.

11:47.907 --> 11:51.365
Oh, so you and Colin
do it to Barry, huh?

11:51.410 --> 11:54.675
No. Colin's so retro.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.615
He likes to make out to Mozart.

11:57.650 --> 11:59.379
What about you, Donna?

11:59.418 --> 12:00.783
You've been awfully quiet.

12:00.820 --> 12:02.913
Well, maybe I just don't
like to talk about sex

12:02.955 --> 12:04.582
as much as you guys do.

12:04.623 --> 12:06.955
You know, that's all we've
talked about since we left L.A.

12:07.059 --> 12:08.686
You even rated
cartoon characters

12:08.728 --> 12:09.820
on which one was sexiest.

12:09.862 --> 12:11.693
I still say Woody Woodpecker.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.255
Have you been with him?

12:13.299 --> 12:15.961
You've been with everybody else.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.161
And what's that
supposed to mean?

12:18.204 --> 12:19.933
It's true, Val.

12:19.972 --> 12:21.769
This has been
quite a year for you.

12:21.807 --> 12:23.570
I don't know if you have
enough wall space

12:23.609 --> 12:25.577
in your bedroom for all the
trophy heads, do you?

12:25.611 --> 12:26.976
You know what you guys?

12:27.046 --> 12:28.536
I'm sick of this.

12:28.581 --> 12:29.946
You love to talk behind my back.

12:29.982 --> 12:32.280
Why don't we just get things
out in the open, huh?

12:32.318 --> 12:33.444
I'd be glad to.

12:33.486 --> 12:34.384
You know what, Donna,
come off it.

12:34.420 --> 12:35.853
I mean, Clare goes out

12:35.888 --> 12:38.118
with David for a few months
and you don't say a damn thing.

12:38.157 --> 12:39.954
I kiss him one time
and you sit in the back seat

12:39.992 --> 12:41.983
and sulk for the last
half an hour.

12:42.061 --> 12:44.154
Yeah, well, David's not the one
I've been thinking about.

12:44.196 --> 12:45.720
Come on, once and for all,

12:45.765 --> 12:47.995
what really happened
between you and Ray?

12:48.100 --> 12:50.728
Okay, let's change
the subject.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.135
Favorite Russian novels...
Kel? Anyone?

12:52.171 --> 12:54.731
No, no, no...
no secrets here, Valerie.

12:54.774 --> 12:55.934
All right.

12:58.144 --> 12:59.236
I slept with him.

13:01.013 --> 13:02.275
Twice.

13:02.314 --> 13:03.781
Oh, my God.

13:03.816 --> 13:05.408
I think I'm going to be sick.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.442
You really are a slut,
aren't you?

13:07.486 --> 13:08.453
Oh, please.

13:08.487 --> 13:09.681
Don't act so surprised.

13:09.722 --> 13:11.087
Like Clare didn't

13:11.123 --> 13:12.420
tell you months ago.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.187
Clare, you knew about this,
and you didn't tell me?

13:14.226 --> 13:16.956
If you knew something like
that about my boyfriend,

13:17.062 --> 13:19.496
- would you have told me?
- No, but you could have told me.

13:19.532 --> 13:21.932
Well, I thought David
told you, you know,

13:21.967 --> 13:23.525
David knew about this, too?

13:23.569 --> 13:24.763
Stop the car.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.669
I'm gonna throw up.

13:36.782 --> 13:39.410
I hope you're proud
of yourself.

13:55.267 --> 13:56.666
I just want to go home.

13:56.702 --> 13:57.828
Come on, you'll be fine.

13:57.870 --> 13:59.098
How can I be fine?

13:59.138 --> 14:01.333
Ray cheated on me
and lied to me for months.

14:01.373 --> 14:03.603
Well, I think maybe
the weekend will do you good.

14:03.642 --> 14:05.872
You know what, you don't even
have to talk to Valerie.

14:05.911 --> 14:08.675
Yeah, as an added bonus,
none of us do.

14:08.714 --> 14:09.874
I heard that.

14:09.915 --> 14:11.143
Good.

14:11.183 --> 14:12.775
What do you guys want me to do?

14:12.818 --> 14:14.308
Just run alongside the car?

14:14.353 --> 14:16.378
You know what, I think
we'd all feel a lot better

14:16.422 --> 14:17.650
if a hole opened
up beneath you

14:17.690 --> 14:18.679
and you just
disappeared forever.

14:18.724 --> 14:20.385
Very funny.

14:20.426 --> 14:22.656
You guys, come on,
let's go.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.492
Yeah, before anything
else happens.

14:31.503 --> 14:33.971
Houston, we have a problem.

14:34.073 --> 14:36.541
Well, that's one thing
you can't blame on me.

14:36.575 --> 14:38.304
Oh yes, we can.
You were sitting in the car.

14:38.344 --> 14:40.539
What's the matter with it?

14:40.579 --> 14:41.568
You guys relax, all right?

14:41.614 --> 14:43.206
I just need to get
under the hood.

14:43.249 --> 14:45.945
Oh, that'll be a big help.

14:45.985 --> 14:48.146
I took auto mechanics
in summer school once.

14:48.187 --> 14:49.779
Excuse me.

14:49.822 --> 14:51.187
Maybe when I look

14:51.223 --> 14:53.487
at the engine,
it'll come back to me.

14:59.632 --> 15:00.599
Well?

15:00.633 --> 15:02.567
It's not coming back to me.

15:06.405 --> 15:09.169
Can I be of assistance?

15:10.276 --> 15:11.504
Oh, yes, Sister,

15:11.543 --> 15:12.908
you can definitely help.

15:12.945 --> 15:14.173
You're a godsend.

15:18.951 --> 15:21.943
This room will be perfect
for your party scene.

15:22.021 --> 15:25.081
But of course.

15:25.124 --> 15:27.217
Hey, you need any extras
for tonight?

15:29.461 --> 15:30.951
What is your name?

15:31.030 --> 15:32.497
Me, I'm Steve.

15:32.531 --> 15:33.498
Steve.

15:33.532 --> 15:34.521
Sit.

15:34.566 --> 15:37.694
Is this an audition?

15:37.736 --> 15:39.135
Yes. Sit.

15:39.171 --> 15:41.696
Like, like you really mean it.

15:46.812 --> 15:49.212
Yes! This is marvelous!

15:49.248 --> 15:50.476
You are great actor, Steve!

15:50.516 --> 15:51.983
More, yes, more...

15:52.017 --> 15:54.281
Fantastic!

15:54.320 --> 15:56.914
lvan, lvan, lvan, I want to
show you something upstairs.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.082
Yes, of course...
yes, yes.

16:02.361 --> 16:03.692
He takes direction so well.

16:03.729 --> 16:04.923
Yuck it up, all right?

16:05.030 --> 16:07.123
But what I hear
from the location manager,

16:07.166 --> 16:08.292
before the revolution,

16:08.334 --> 16:10.928
this guy was the Scorsese
of his country.

16:11.036 --> 16:12.765
Dude, and you're
the cornball of ours.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.170
Now, what country is he from

16:14.206 --> 16:15.173
exactly, Steve?

16:15.207 --> 16:16.265
Is that pornographia?

16:18.010 --> 16:20.069
You're blowing it.
Oh, yeah.

16:20.112 --> 16:23.513
This is an opportunity
of a lifetime.

16:23.549 --> 16:25.949
You could dine on
this stuff for years.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.646
And you could get VD
from this for years.

16:27.686 --> 16:29.085
Look, Steve, I'm
sure Brandon's still at

16:29.121 --> 16:30.281
the Co <i>n</i> dor's office right now.

16:30.322 --> 16:31.949
Why don't you just
call him and tell him

16:32.057 --> 16:33.718
- what's going on. - No, no,
I don't want to call him.

16:33.759 --> 16:35.249
I don't want to do it
over the phone, all right?

16:35.294 --> 16:37.262
Relax! There's nothing
to be ashamed about.

16:37.296 --> 16:39.821
Many of lvan Frotz films
play in art houses.

16:39.865 --> 16:41.298
Uh, excuse me, sir.
Could you, uh,

16:41.333 --> 16:42.823
could you tell me
what the title

16:42.868 --> 16:44.426
of this film is?

16:44.470 --> 16:47.234
Top/ess Pizza Party Three.

16:47.272 --> 16:49.206
Ah, very artistic.

16:49.241 --> 16:50.469
First team.

16:50.509 --> 16:53.842
Actresses on set!

16:53.879 --> 16:56.279
Okay, see, I dare you
guys to leave now.

16:56.315 --> 16:57.577
Oh, no.

16:57.616 --> 16:59.243
Yeah, you're gonna
stick around.

16:59.284 --> 17:01.844
- Excu... I'm not in this.
- Oh, no, no, he's not qualified.

17:01.887 --> 17:03.377
Very funny.

17:07.492 --> 17:09.654
Hello.

17:09.694 --> 17:12.528
Hi. I've been trying to reach
you for the last hour.

17:12.564 --> 17:14.555
Well, I was catching a couple
extra waves out at Surfrider.

17:14.599 --> 17:16.032
Wish you could've been there.

17:16.068 --> 17:19.435
Mm, my days of cutting class
are over according to my father.

17:19.471 --> 17:22.531
Well, I'm sure
father knows best.

17:22.574 --> 17:24.838
I had a talk with him
last night about you

17:24.877 --> 17:26.138
and he wants to meet you.

17:26.178 --> 17:28.476
Oh, well, the feeling is mutual.

17:28.513 --> 17:29.708
Good, because he made
reservations

17:29.748 --> 17:31.875
for us tonight at Egressia.
Can you make it?

17:31.917 --> 17:33.111
Of course.

17:33.152 --> 17:35.177
Dylan, you're never
going to believe this.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.188
My dad said
that he knew your father.

17:37.222 --> 17:38.519
Small world, huh?

17:38.557 --> 17:39.956
Tiny.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.492
Listen, can you pick me up.

17:41.527 --> 17:43.427
The reservation's not till 7:30.

17:43.462 --> 17:44.656
We'll meet him there.

17:44.696 --> 17:45.754
I'll see you at 7:00.

17:45.798 --> 17:47.789
Great. Bye.

18:03.182 --> 18:04.581
You girls aren't the first

18:04.616 --> 18:06.641
to run into car trouble
on these roads.

18:06.685 --> 18:09.586
But I'm sure there's
a gas station nearby, right?

18:09.621 --> 18:11.919
No, it's a pretty solitary
mountaintop.

18:11.990 --> 18:14.652
That's why the convent was built
here in the first place.

18:14.693 --> 18:16.820
We were headed
to Elysia Springs.

18:16.862 --> 18:18.193
Is that anywhere near here?

18:18.230 --> 18:19.527
Miles.

18:19.565 --> 18:20.930
You must have taken
the wrong road

18:21.033 --> 18:22.432
at the base of the mountain.

18:24.470 --> 18:26.734
- Back off.
- Don't worry.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.137
We have guest quarters.

18:28.173 --> 18:29.936
You'll stay the night,
and in the morning

18:29.975 --> 18:31.875
Sister Agnes will fix your car.

18:31.910 --> 18:33.434
She's an excellent mechanic.

18:33.479 --> 18:34.878
Thank you, Sister Alice.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.519
God bless you.

18:47.559 --> 18:48.958
He already has.

18:48.994 --> 18:50.154
Right this way.

18:50.195 --> 18:51.492
I'll show you
to your room.

18:57.736 --> 19:00.603
I hope you'll be
comfortable here.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.368
We don't get many visitors.

19:02.407 --> 19:03.738
Oh, I'm sure we
will be.

19:03.775 --> 19:05.140
Thank you,
Sister Alice.

19:05.177 --> 19:06.838
I'll be back
with your bedding.

19:08.847 --> 19:11.782
Boy, I sure am glad
we took that shortcut,

19:11.817 --> 19:13.682
otherwise we'd be lounging by
the hot springs right now.

19:13.719 --> 19:15.050
Oh, big tragedy.

19:15.087 --> 19:18.284
Kelly Taylor has to spend
the night on spartan sheets.

19:18.323 --> 19:19.654
I can rough it with
the best of them.

19:19.691 --> 19:20.817
That's just not how
this weekend was billed.

19:20.859 --> 19:22.258
Oh, okay, I'll make sure

19:22.294 --> 19:24.558
there isn't a little pea
under your mattress, all right?

19:24.596 --> 19:26.188
You know, something
about this place...

19:26.231 --> 19:27.562
doesn't it make you

19:27.599 --> 19:30.932
want to sing "Do Re Mi"
and dance on the hilltops?

19:31.036 --> 19:32.401
Too bad Ray

19:32.437 --> 19:33.699
isn't here with his guitar.

19:33.739 --> 19:35.934
Oh, you had to mention
his name, didn't you?

19:35.974 --> 19:37.498
Well, at least it got
you talking to me.

19:37.543 --> 19:39.238
Come on, how long are you three

19:39.278 --> 19:40.802
saints going to beat
this dead horse?

19:40.846 --> 19:42.279
Forgive me,

19:42.314 --> 19:43.747
for I have sinned, okay?

19:43.782 --> 19:45.044
Yeah, you have.

19:45.083 --> 19:47.278
Well, excuse me,
Miss Holier-than-thou.

19:47.319 --> 19:50.288
Didn't I hear about a little
summer sublet with Dylan

19:50.322 --> 19:52.153
when Brenda was across the pond?

19:52.191 --> 19:53.283
You don't know
what you're talking about.

19:55.260 --> 19:57.125
Oh, one other thing, friends.

19:57.162 --> 19:59.960
Our silent time begins
at the bell's final toll.

19:59.998 --> 20:01.124
Silent time?

20:01.166 --> 20:02.895
Oh, yes.

20:02.935 --> 20:05.460
From sunset to sunrise,
no more talking from anyone.

20:05.504 --> 20:06.630
Good.

20:07.940 --> 20:08.964
See you at dinner.

20:11.610 --> 20:12.702
Is this for real?

20:12.744 --> 20:14.678
It's one way to shut you up.

20:16.782 --> 20:18.272
Shh!

20:18.317 --> 20:19.477
Remember...

20:19.518 --> 20:20.678
God is listening.

20:34.166 --> 20:36.566
Ah, baby.

20:36.602 --> 20:39.833
- Ah, baby...
- Cut!

20:39.871 --> 20:42.203
Exquisite!

20:42.241 --> 20:43.606
Ray, Ray.

20:43.642 --> 20:45.405
You really ought to check out
some of this moviemaking.

20:45.444 --> 20:47.002
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.239
No, that's cool, man.

20:48.280 --> 20:49.747
I think one peek
was enough for me.

20:49.781 --> 20:51.772
Yeah, right, yeah, right.

20:51.817 --> 20:54.650
If you wanted to leave, you
could have gone with David.

20:54.686 --> 20:56.586
Hey, kids.

20:56.622 --> 20:58.681
So this is Hollywood, huh?

20:58.724 --> 21:00.487
Bran, I was beginning to think
you weren't gonna make it.

21:00.525 --> 21:02.618
No, no, no, no. I just got
held up rewriting my column.

21:02.661 --> 21:03.559
Did they start filming yet?

21:03.595 --> 21:05.256
Bang, bang, boing.

21:05.297 --> 21:06.195
So to speak.

21:06.231 --> 21:07.960
Steve,

21:08.000 --> 21:09.490
my good friend...

21:09.534 --> 21:11.229
I'm about to make
your dreams come true.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.329
- What can I do for you?
- One of my actors,

21:13.372 --> 21:14.771
he called in sick.

21:14.806 --> 21:17.434
I want you or one of your
friends to portray

21:17.476 --> 21:21.378
the small but pivotal role
of the pizza deliveryman.

21:21.413 --> 21:24.246
Work it out
among yourselves.

21:25.217 --> 21:26.650
Be my guest, man.

21:26.685 --> 21:29.176
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second,
don't I get a shot at this?

21:29.221 --> 21:30.586
Bran, there's something

21:30.622 --> 21:33.716
you should know
before you volunteer.

21:39.398 --> 21:42.231
Thank you.

21:44.436 --> 21:45.869
Steve?

21:45.904 --> 21:46.962
What?

21:47.005 --> 21:48.597
What the hell
is going on here?

21:48.640 --> 21:49.834
Is this a porno movie?

21:49.875 --> 21:51.433
It's not a porno.

21:51.476 --> 21:53.307
It's adult entertainment

21:53.345 --> 21:55.973
and it's been very
entertaining, I might add.

21:56.014 --> 21:57.106
Right, Ray?

21:57.149 --> 21:58.514
I had nothing to do with this.

21:58.550 --> 22:01.485
Sanders, have you
been exercising

22:01.520 --> 22:02.680
in a freshly painted room?

22:02.721 --> 22:04.655
Well, I did a few
pull-ups upstairs, but...

22:04.690 --> 22:05.714
that's it.

22:05.757 --> 22:07.520
- Come on, Bran.
- Is this legal?

22:07.559 --> 22:08.617
Of course.

22:08.660 --> 22:09.718
It's just harmless fun.

22:09.761 --> 22:11.126
It is not harmless, Steve.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.653
It's pornography.

22:12.698 --> 22:14.427
It's sleazy,
it's degrading, it's wrong.

22:14.466 --> 22:16.400
It's got to stop right now.

22:16.435 --> 22:17.561
What are you talking about?

22:17.602 --> 22:18.796
You signed the contract,
remember? We got paid.

22:18.837 --> 22:21.806
Just relax and
enjoy the eye candy.

22:23.542 --> 22:24.668
Ooh,

22:24.710 --> 22:25.802
you're cute.

22:25.844 --> 22:27.641
Am I working with you today?

22:32.417 --> 22:35.147
I can't believe I almost
invited Susan here.

22:36.855 --> 22:38.447
Excuse me. Yoo-hoo!

22:45.397 --> 22:46.989
What do I do?

22:47.065 --> 22:48.555
Answer it.

22:51.870 --> 22:52.996
Hello?

22:53.071 --> 22:55.665
- Kelly.
- Colin. Hold on.

22:55.707 --> 22:59.268
Um, go find Clare.
I'll meet you at dinner.

22:59.311 --> 23:01.871
I can't really talk right now.

23:01.913 --> 23:03.437
Did you lose your voice
or something?

23:03.482 --> 23:04.949
No, I'm in a convent.

23:04.983 --> 23:06.712
I took a vow of silence.

23:06.752 --> 23:07.810
What?

23:07.853 --> 23:09.286
I'll explain later.
I have to go.

23:09.321 --> 23:11.380
Yeah, me, too.
You okay?

23:11.423 --> 23:12.651
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

23:14.126 --> 23:17.527
Listen, I'm on my way out
to dinner with my art dealer.

23:17.562 --> 23:19.792
I just wanted to call you
and tell you I missed you.

23:19.831 --> 23:21.162
Me, too.

23:21.199 --> 23:24.225
- I'll see you when I get back.
- Okay. Bye.

23:24.269 --> 23:26.066
Who was that?

23:26.104 --> 23:28.436
An art groupie?

23:28.473 --> 23:30.668
A good friend.

23:30.709 --> 23:33.234
Well, roam all you want,
my darling,

23:33.278 --> 23:35.109
but just remember,

23:35.147 --> 23:38.605
no one's as good to you as me.

24:01.239 --> 24:03.901
This vow of silence
is killing me.

24:03.942 --> 24:05.910
Ah, what a relief

24:05.944 --> 24:09.175
to see some different faces
around here for a change.

24:09.214 --> 24:11.478
And such nice girls.

24:11.516 --> 24:14.952
What are you
grinning at, Sister?

24:15.053 --> 24:17.078
She can't even
look me in the eye.

24:18.957 --> 24:20.424
Check her out, Sisters.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.723
You're dining
with the Devil's handmaiden.

24:22.761 --> 24:26.197
They all seem to be
such good friends.

24:26.231 --> 24:28.563
Potatoes, please.

24:28.600 --> 24:31.467
I wonder what
Ms. Shortcut wants now.

24:31.503 --> 24:33.664
Pass the damn potatoes.

24:34.840 --> 24:37.001
I mean, darn potatoes.

24:41.112 --> 24:43.307
I hope they go
right to your thighs.

24:44.816 --> 24:47.284
I wonder if any of them
are virgins.

24:49.054 --> 24:52.717
Are any young girls
virgins anymore?

24:54.359 --> 24:56.623
What is she so pissed off for?

24:56.661 --> 24:58.925
I did her a favor,
sleeping with Ray.

24:58.964 --> 25:00.932
She's too good for him.

25:00.966 --> 25:03.127
I always thought
there was something going on

25:03.168 --> 25:04.635
between her and Ray.

25:04.669 --> 25:06.864
I guess I never
wanted to admit it.

25:06.905 --> 25:11.308
I never wanted to admit
a lot of things about Ray.

25:12.744 --> 25:14.769
At least you don't have
any man problems.

25:14.813 --> 25:17.304
Maybe I should have checked
into a place like this

25:17.349 --> 25:19.442
a long time ago.

25:28.727 --> 25:31.252
Glasses.

25:31.296 --> 25:33.230
Thank you.

25:33.265 --> 25:36.496
I can't believe you're actually
gonna go through with this.

25:36.535 --> 25:37.559
Why not?

25:37.602 --> 25:39.194
No one's gonna recognize me.

25:39.237 --> 25:41.171
He's definitely not thinking
with his head right now.

25:41.206 --> 25:42.332
- No, he's not.
- You know,

25:42.374 --> 25:44.239
nine out of ten
red-blooded American men

25:44.276 --> 25:46.335
would gladly swap places
with me right now.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.346
Places!

25:48.380 --> 25:50.473
Show time.

25:51.783 --> 25:53.546
- Go get 'em, big guy.
- There you go.

25:56.321 --> 25:57.788
Ooh, aah, eeh...

25:57.822 --> 25:58.846
Here.

25:58.890 --> 25:59.982
Care-Careful.

26:00.025 --> 26:01.652
They really are hot.

26:01.693 --> 26:04.628
The chicks or the pizza?

26:06.298 --> 26:08.027
Smell that pepperoni.

26:08.066 --> 26:09.260
Mmm.

26:13.638 --> 26:15.367
Steve...

26:15.407 --> 26:17.136
this is your moment.

26:17.175 --> 26:18.802
Do you know your line?

26:18.843 --> 26:20.174
Yes. Um...

26:20.211 --> 26:21.906
Did anyone order pizza?

26:21.947 --> 26:23.915
- Beautiful.
- Yeah?

26:23.949 --> 26:27.646
Now, let nature
take its course. Yes?

26:27.686 --> 26:29.381
Yes.

26:29.421 --> 26:30.718
Let's go.

26:30.755 --> 26:33.223
On the bell.

26:33.258 --> 26:35.226
I like that guy.

26:35.260 --> 26:36.727
Okay!

26:38.096 --> 26:40.428
Scene ten, take one, marker.

26:40.465 --> 26:41.864
Quiet!

26:41.900 --> 26:43.561
Action!

26:50.175 --> 26:52.803
Anyone order a pizza?

26:52.844 --> 26:54.812
No, but since you're here,

26:54.846 --> 26:56.814
why don't you come on in?

26:56.848 --> 26:59.373
Okay.

27:01.386 --> 27:02.683
The kid's a natural.

27:02.721 --> 27:04.052
Look at him go.

27:04.089 --> 27:06.717
Why don't you have a seat
right there? - Hi.

27:06.758 --> 27:08.453
I'll put this...

27:10.295 --> 27:11.990
Careful, I bruise easy.

27:17.202 --> 27:19.102
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo,
I'm very ticklish.

27:19.137 --> 27:20.229
That's got to hurt.

27:20.271 --> 27:21.533
That looks really painful.

27:23.041 --> 27:24.201
Stop!

27:24.242 --> 27:26.142
Stop...

27:28.847 --> 27:29.814
Cut!

27:29.848 --> 27:31.941
Oh! That was exquisite!

27:32.050 --> 27:33.677
Now let's move in for coverage.

27:33.718 --> 27:35.811
Or, uh, un-coverage.

27:35.854 --> 27:36.946
You want me to do this again?

27:37.055 --> 27:38.488
- But of course.
- Brandon Walsh!

27:38.523 --> 27:42.687
You have a visitor.

27:45.263 --> 27:46.787
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

27:46.831 --> 27:48.093
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:48.133 --> 27:50.693
Hi. My bridge game was canceled,

27:50.735 --> 27:52.066
- so...
- Mm-hmm.

27:52.103 --> 27:53.570
Ready for my close-up?

27:53.605 --> 27:55.869
No. No. 'Cause, uh,
'cause we're leaving.

27:55.907 --> 27:57.374
What are you talking about?
I just got here.

27:57.409 --> 27:58.398
- I want to take a look! - No,
Susan, Susan, we're leaving.

27:58.443 --> 28:00.308
- What...
- Susan, we're leaving.

28:00.345 --> 28:01.471
It's very powerful.

28:03.915 --> 28:06.748
Susan, come on, let's go.
Let's go, let's go.

28:06.785 --> 28:08.446
Oh, no, no, not in there.

28:08.486 --> 28:09.783
Susan, don't look in there.

28:13.358 --> 28:15.849
Ah...

28:15.894 --> 28:17.862
They're all naked.

28:17.896 --> 28:19.193
This isn't what it looks like.

28:19.230 --> 28:20.219
Yeah, right.

28:20.265 --> 28:21.630
This isn't what it looks like.

28:21.666 --> 28:23.759
You're shooting a porn
movie in your house!

28:23.802 --> 28:25.770
No, no, no, no.
they're shooting the porn movie.

28:25.804 --> 28:27.931
I was just...
I can explain this.

28:28.039 --> 28:29.165
Oh, don't bother explaining.

28:29.207 --> 28:31.175
I mean, now it all makes
sense, why you were

28:31.209 --> 28:33.370
twisting my arm to get me
to come over here. Ugh!

28:33.411 --> 28:34.742
Quiet on the set!

28:34.779 --> 28:36.440
Places, please.

28:36.481 --> 28:39.609
If this is your world, Walsh,
I don't want any part of it.

28:39.651 --> 28:42.950
Susan, come on, you're being
totally ridiculous here.

28:44.622 --> 28:46.590
Pretty girl.
Get her back.

28:46.624 --> 28:48.615
We put nurse's cap on her.

28:50.095 --> 28:51.426
You know what?

28:51.463 --> 28:54.159
Why don't you pack up
all your little toys here, lvan,

28:54.199 --> 28:56.064
and why don't you
get out of my house?

28:56.101 --> 28:57.898
Bran, Bran, the
contract, the money,

28:57.936 --> 28:59.301
you can't just...
you can't...

28:59.337 --> 29:00.827
I can.

29:00.872 --> 29:02.567
Sue me.

29:06.277 --> 29:08.302
He, too, is very talented.

29:11.783 --> 29:13.717
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

29:13.752 --> 29:15.413
I'm surprised
my father's not here yet.

29:15.453 --> 29:16.579
He's usually never late.

29:16.621 --> 29:18.384
I'll try not
to take it personally.

29:18.423 --> 29:19.617
He's not that intimidating.

29:19.657 --> 29:22.387
And if he gets out of
line, I can handle him.

29:22.427 --> 29:24.361
I'm counting on it.

29:24.395 --> 29:25.726
But I'm sure

29:25.764 --> 29:27.061
he'll be on his best behavior.

29:27.098 --> 29:28.429
I know that despite
their differences,

29:28.466 --> 29:29.933
he thought a lot of your father.

29:30.034 --> 29:32.400
He told you that?

29:32.437 --> 29:33.904
Yeah, he did.

29:33.938 --> 29:37.840
Did he also tell you
that my father was murdered?

29:37.876 --> 29:39.468
No.

29:40.912 --> 29:43.039
Dylan, I'm sorry.

29:44.716 --> 29:46.581
Why didn't you
ever say anything?

29:46.618 --> 29:49.280
Well, it's kind
of a conversation stopper.

29:49.320 --> 29:51.754
Excuse me,
your father just called.

29:51.790 --> 29:54.691
- He asked that you start
without him. - Thank you.

29:55.727 --> 29:58.059
Well, this isn't like him.

30:12.577 --> 30:14.602
All right!

30:14.646 --> 30:17.410
Explain yourself quickly,
then go home.

30:17.448 --> 30:18.938
Can I come in?

30:18.983 --> 30:20.541
Not without delousing.

30:20.585 --> 30:23.816
Pornography is something
I find particularly revolting.

30:23.855 --> 30:26.949
Susan, I was as surprised as you
were about what was going on.

30:26.991 --> 30:29.391
My roommate has the occasional
lapse in good judgment.

30:29.427 --> 30:31.122
Well, if it is true
that we are known

30:31.162 --> 30:33.926
by the company that we keep,
then what does it say about you

30:33.965 --> 30:35.865
that you are living
with some kind of pervert?

30:35.900 --> 30:38.596
Not to mention, one that
is so clueless he cheated

30:38.636 --> 30:40.263
on a placement test.

30:40.305 --> 30:42.330
How do you know about that?

30:42.373 --> 30:44.398
- That's confidential.
- Please.

30:44.442 --> 30:47.002
The story is legendary
among the math faculty.

30:47.045 --> 30:48.273
Steve's a bonehead.

30:48.313 --> 30:51.476
No, Steve's actions
were bonehead.

30:51.516 --> 30:52.949
But 20 years down the road,

30:52.984 --> 30:54.884
Steve's still gonna be
my best friend.

30:54.919 --> 30:58.082
I can't say the same for
the next 20 seconds with you.

30:59.691 --> 31:02.489
Wait a minute.

31:03.962 --> 31:06.658
You swear you didn't know
anything about this?

31:06.698 --> 31:09.223
No. I'm saying
I didn't know what it was

31:09.267 --> 31:10.598
until I got there tonight.

31:10.635 --> 31:14.196
And maybe I should have
stopped it sooner, but...

31:14.239 --> 31:15.900
I didn't.

31:20.845 --> 31:22.176
Come in.

31:38.630 --> 31:42.430
Who am I to blame Valerie
for sleeping around?

31:42.467 --> 31:46.426
Let she who has not sinned
cast the first stone.

31:46.471 --> 31:48.496
I've sinned as much as anybody.

31:48.539 --> 31:51.406
I slept with
my best friend's boyfriend.

31:51.442 --> 31:54.673
I slept with
my boyfriend's best friend.

31:54.712 --> 31:57.840
I hope at least God
can forgive me.

32:00.752 --> 32:03.220
Listen, God,
if you're up there,

32:03.254 --> 32:05.119
I don't ask for a lot.

32:05.156 --> 32:07.454
I just need friends,
like everybody else.

32:07.492 --> 32:09.824
And I always seem
to screw 'em up.

32:09.861 --> 32:11.556
Maybe you could help me out.

32:11.596 --> 32:14.497
And while you're at it,
could you look out for Donna?

32:14.532 --> 32:16.227
Your sweetest lamb
hasn't figured out,

32:16.267 --> 32:18.360
when her boyfriend
throws her down the stairs,

32:18.403 --> 32:20.667
it doesn't mean "I love you."

32:22.373 --> 32:24.466
Now I lay me down to sleep,

32:24.509 --> 32:26.568
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

32:26.611 --> 32:28.738
If I should die before I wake,

32:28.780 --> 32:31.578
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

32:31.616 --> 32:34.744
God bless
my family and friends,

32:34.786 --> 32:36.413
even Valerie,

32:36.454 --> 32:37.648
the witch!

32:37.689 --> 32:39.680
Amen.

32:41.859 --> 32:44.327
Uh... listen, God,

32:44.362 --> 32:46.523
I just want to know one thing.

32:46.564 --> 32:48.964
When Sartre wrote No Exit,

32:49.000 --> 32:51.696
was he thinking of this place?

32:58.409 --> 33:00.809
Mmm. I never got
what the attraction

33:00.845 --> 33:02.335
of pornography was, anyway.

33:02.380 --> 33:04.041
Some people think it's erotic.

33:04.082 --> 33:05.947
If you knew how many
convicted rapists

33:05.984 --> 33:07.281
are regular porn watchers,

33:07.318 --> 33:09.912
you may not be
such a fan, either.

33:09.954 --> 33:12.616
I can't believe I'm hearing
a censorship argument

33:12.657 --> 33:14.318
from a newspaper woman.

33:14.359 --> 33:15.951
I wouldn't ban it.

33:16.027 --> 33:19.360
But I wouldn't invite it
into my living room, either.

33:19.397 --> 33:21.661
Ah.

33:21.699 --> 33:24.930
I'm never gonna live
this one down, am I?

33:24.969 --> 33:26.197
No.

33:26.237 --> 33:28.228
Didn't think so.

33:29.807 --> 33:32.241
So, what do you find erotic?

33:32.276 --> 33:34.836
Well... the massage
was a good start.

33:34.879 --> 33:35.971
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

33:36.047 --> 33:38.481
What else?

33:38.516 --> 33:40.507
Hot baths...

33:40.551 --> 33:42.212
candles...

33:42.253 --> 33:44.312
You know, romance.

33:44.355 --> 33:45.982
- Romance is good.
- Mm-hmm.

33:46.024 --> 33:47.855
Except you'd probably
want to videotape it.

33:47.892 --> 33:50.053
Never on the first date.

33:51.462 --> 33:53.760
I'm glad you stayed.

33:53.798 --> 33:56.528
So am I.

33:56.567 --> 33:58.967
I could run a bath.

33:59.003 --> 34:00.800
I could light some candles.

34:00.838 --> 34:03.033
I think we're on the same page.

34:03.074 --> 34:04.564
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

34:12.116 --> 34:14.607
No more coffee for me, thanks.

34:14.652 --> 34:16.516
Could we have the check, please?

34:16.554 --> 34:19.545
It's on my father.
It's the least he can do.

34:19.590 --> 34:21.751
Antonia, your father's
on the phone.

34:21.793 --> 34:23.283
He'd like to speak to you.

34:23.327 --> 34:24.851
Thank you, Gerard.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.795
Excuse me while I go scold him.

34:26.831 --> 34:29.231
This was supposed
to be an evening with

34:29.266 --> 34:30.699
my two favorite men.

34:34.272 --> 34:36.137
I'll be right back.

34:45.983 --> 34:47.210
This seat taken?

34:47.251 --> 34:49.116
You're late.

34:49.152 --> 34:50.585
You didn't really think
I'd have dinner

34:50.621 --> 34:52.589
with the son of Jack McKay,
now, did you?

34:52.623 --> 34:54.523
Come on. I thought
you two were supposed

34:54.559 --> 34:55.650
to be such great friends.

34:55.693 --> 34:57.456
Let's make this
as brief as possible.

34:57.495 --> 34:58.757
What is it you want? Money?

34:58.796 --> 35:01.788
No. No, I want you
to give yourself up.

35:02.867 --> 35:04.892
Or die. It's your choice.

35:04.936 --> 35:08.929
You know, I thought
after my friend Tom E. Rose

35:09.006 --> 35:12.100
showed you the sights
of Palm Springs that,

35:12.143 --> 35:14.168
well, you knew what
you had coming.

35:14.212 --> 35:16.612
That's when I was afraid
of dying an unnatural death.

35:16.647 --> 35:17.909
Mm. And now you're not?

35:17.949 --> 35:19.576
And now I'm not.

35:19.617 --> 35:21.141
Because I have
a safe-deposit box,

35:21.185 --> 35:24.951
and in that box is enough
information to nail you.

35:24.989 --> 35:26.547
So if anything...

35:26.591 --> 35:29.560
anything happens to me,

35:29.594 --> 35:31.619
it's the gift
that keeps on giving.

35:35.032 --> 35:36.761
Stay away from my daughter.

35:36.801 --> 35:37.961
Or what?

35:38.035 --> 35:41.766
Or I'll have Ronnie here
just aim a little lower

35:41.806 --> 35:44.138
and wound you.

35:46.911 --> 35:49.971
Gentlemen, please,

35:50.081 --> 35:51.981
I mean,
coarse behavior like this?

35:52.083 --> 35:53.983
I am shocked.

35:54.085 --> 35:57.282
However, my opinion of you
is sufficiently low enough

35:57.321 --> 35:58.549
that I, too, came prepared.

36:06.731 --> 36:08.926
You wouldn't do anything
that stupid.

36:09.033 --> 36:10.864
Neither would you.

36:12.837 --> 36:14.361
So I'm gonna put my gun away.

36:14.405 --> 36:15.565
I'm gonna say good night...

36:16.874 --> 36:20.071
...and then I'm gonna
take Toni home.

36:20.111 --> 36:24.241
Actually, Antonia
is already on her way home.

36:24.282 --> 36:26.648
Yeah, well, that's too bad,

36:26.684 --> 36:28.345
because we were just getting
to the part

36:28.386 --> 36:31.082
where I tell her
how you killed my father.

36:34.759 --> 36:35.748
Get him out of here.

36:35.793 --> 36:36.760
No problem.

36:36.794 --> 36:37.761
Just ask...

36:37.795 --> 36:39.490
politely,

36:39.530 --> 36:41.327
and I'll leave.

36:43.634 --> 36:45.932
I'll leave...

36:45.970 --> 36:48.803
but I won't go away.

36:48.839 --> 36:51.774
I'm never going away

36:51.809 --> 36:53.936
until you're put away.

37:13.364 --> 37:15.332
Good morning, Donna.

37:15.366 --> 37:17.357
Oh, can we speak?

37:17.401 --> 37:19.335
The silence ended at daybreak.

37:19.370 --> 37:21.338
I kind of got used to the quiet.

37:21.372 --> 37:22.839
I even liked it.

37:22.873 --> 37:25.205
It's a nice respite from
the noise and confusion

37:25.243 --> 37:27.404
of everyday life.

37:27.445 --> 37:29.936
You know, I-I had
a dream last night.

37:30.014 --> 37:31.948
I dreamt that I left
my confusing life behind

37:32.049 --> 37:34.517
and took the oath of the church.

37:34.552 --> 37:37.612
I have the opposite dream
sometimes.

37:38.656 --> 37:39.953
I like it here.

37:39.991 --> 37:42.551
It's so simple and safe.

37:42.593 --> 37:44.288
I know if I lived your life,

37:44.328 --> 37:46.262
I wouldn't have
so much heartache.

37:46.297 --> 37:48.458
A boy?

37:48.499 --> 37:52.868
Yep, it's a recurring theme.

37:52.903 --> 37:56.168
I meet 'em,
I love 'em, they let me down.

37:56.207 --> 37:59.836
I notice how respectful
you are, Donna.

37:59.877 --> 38:01.868
The church must mean
a lot to you.

38:01.912 --> 38:04.813
It does.

38:04.849 --> 38:06.840
How'd you know
you wanted to be a nun?

38:06.884 --> 38:08.749
I had a calling.

38:08.786 --> 38:10.913
Do you think my dream
was a calling?

38:10.988 --> 38:12.012
If you had to ask,

38:12.056 --> 38:13.614
it wasn't.

38:13.658 --> 38:15.819
But you certainly don't have
to join an order

38:15.860 --> 38:17.088
to maintain your faith.

38:17.128 --> 38:19.494
Well, mine's been tested lately.

38:19.530 --> 38:20.929
It always will be.

38:20.998 --> 38:25.662
You have to remember what an
imperfect world we live in.

38:25.703 --> 38:26.931
With imperfect people.

38:26.971 --> 38:29.940
Which makes forgiveness
an important virtue.

38:30.007 --> 38:33.909
You know, Sister Alice,
you're good at this.

38:33.944 --> 38:36.708
That's why they pay me
the big bucks.

39:18.989 --> 39:20.923
I don't believe it.

39:21.025 --> 39:22.253
What?

39:24.428 --> 39:27.158
You passed the test.

39:27.198 --> 39:29.325
Well, I mean, last night
was pretty good.

39:29.367 --> 39:30.834
Oh, yeah, it was.

39:30.868 --> 39:32.529
But that's not what I mean.

39:32.570 --> 39:34.697
You made my bed.
That was my test.

39:34.739 --> 39:36.070
No one's ever passed before.

39:36.107 --> 39:37.131
Oh.

39:37.174 --> 39:40.302
Oh. Hey, hey, hey,
wait a minute.

39:40.344 --> 39:41.811
I just made this bed.

39:41.846 --> 39:43.279
Guess you'll have
to make it again.

39:43.314 --> 39:45.612
Mm. Oh, okay.

39:51.489 --> 39:54.049
I can't believe
it was just a broken water hose.

39:54.091 --> 39:56.082
Whatever.
It's fixed.

39:56.127 --> 39:58.493
Now we just have to find Donna.

39:58.529 --> 39:59.826
Good morning, sisters.

39:59.864 --> 40:01.593
So, I guess
we're talking now, huh?

40:01.632 --> 40:03.327
Silent time is over.

40:03.367 --> 40:05.426
But are we talking to me?

40:05.469 --> 40:07.960
Well, I'd like to make
an official peace offering.

40:08.005 --> 40:10.235
I've thought about it,
and what's done, is done.

40:10.274 --> 40:12.242
I think we should
put it behind us.

40:12.276 --> 40:13.470
All of us.

40:13.511 --> 40:15.069
If that's how you want it.

40:15.112 --> 40:16.670
Come on. Let's go say
bye to everybody.

40:16.714 --> 40:21.845
Uh, Donna, listen, um,

40:21.886 --> 40:23.285
I don't know what
you plan to say to Ray,

40:23.320 --> 40:25.754
but before you kiss and make up,

40:25.790 --> 40:27.348
make sure he's worth it.

40:27.391 --> 40:29.222
Are you talking
about Palm Springs?

40:29.260 --> 40:30.522
Yeah,

40:30.561 --> 40:33.587
and I can't forget what I saw
Ray do to you...

40:33.631 --> 40:35.690
and you shouldn't either.

40:54.452 --> 40:57.387
I didn't know
if I'd ever see you again.

40:57.421 --> 40:59.013
Well, maybe after today
you won't.

41:00.891 --> 41:02.222
My father told me

41:02.259 --> 41:03.783
some very upsetting things
about you, Dylan.

41:03.828 --> 41:07.195
Yeah? Like what?

41:07.231 --> 41:08.721
Like you used me.

41:10.167 --> 41:12.601
Like you have
some sort of vendetta.

41:12.636 --> 41:15.127
I can't lie to you.

41:15.172 --> 41:17.970
It started that way.

41:18.042 --> 41:20.567
It did...

41:20.611 --> 41:24.638
but that was before I saw you.

41:26.917 --> 41:28.612
My father is a good man.

41:28.652 --> 41:30.381
And if you knew him...

41:30.421 --> 41:34.448
I know that he had my father
blown to little pieces.

41:36.961 --> 41:39.930
He said that you were gonna try
to turn me against him.

41:39.964 --> 41:41.556
Toni,

41:41.599 --> 41:42.827
ask him.

41:42.867 --> 41:44.596
Ask anybody who knew
what was gonna happen

41:44.635 --> 41:47.160
when my Dad turned state's
evidence against him.

41:49.573 --> 41:50.801
You're wrong.

41:50.841 --> 41:53.935
My father could never
do anything like that.

41:59.550 --> 42:01.882
Then I guess there's nothing...

42:01.919 --> 42:03.887
left to say.

42:21.672 --> 42:23.537
What were you thinking?

42:23.574 --> 42:25.508
You're mounting
a big show in one week.

42:25.543 --> 42:27.101
How do you have time

42:27.144 --> 42:28.975
to paint a silly mural
for a nightclub?

42:29.046 --> 42:30.570
Claudia, back off.

42:30.614 --> 42:32.138
I'm ready for the show.

42:32.182 --> 42:33.649
I'm on top of it.

42:33.684 --> 42:34.708
I don't like it.

42:34.752 --> 42:37.346
And you sold yourself
way too cheap.

42:37.388 --> 42:39.288
How many times have I told you,

42:39.323 --> 42:42.690
artists don't negotiate
their own deals?

42:42.726 --> 42:45.160
And they should never negotiate
with old friends.

42:45.195 --> 42:47.163
Kelly...

42:47.197 --> 42:48.357
Hi, I'm Kelly Taylor.

42:48.399 --> 42:50.424
You must be Colin's art dealer.

42:50.467 --> 42:51.695
Claudia Van Eyck.

42:51.735 --> 42:53.430
What are you doing home so soon?

42:53.470 --> 42:54.937
You weren't due back
till tomorrow.

42:54.972 --> 42:56.997
It's a long story.

42:57.041 --> 42:58.508
Well, you can tell him
all about it.

42:58.542 --> 42:59.531
I'm on my way out.

42:59.577 --> 43:00.566
I'll see you at dinner.

43:00.611 --> 43:01.942
Nice to meet you, Kelly.

43:01.979 --> 43:03.276
You, too.

43:05.749 --> 43:07.580
Boy, am I glad to see you.

43:07.618 --> 43:09.279
Hmm... prove it.

43:15.459 --> 43:17.359
It's true, isn't it, Ray?

43:17.394 --> 43:18.554
Isn't it?!

43:18.596 --> 43:21.827
Okay. Okay, it's true.

43:21.865 --> 43:24.527
I slept with her once...

43:24.568 --> 43:25.933
and never again.

43:25.970 --> 43:27.335
And I knew it was a mistake.

43:27.371 --> 43:29.236
You are such a liar.

43:29.273 --> 43:30.797
Valerie told me

43:30.841 --> 43:32.240
all the details...
it was twice!

43:32.276 --> 43:34.267
That bitch.

43:34.311 --> 43:36.245
Yeah, well,
that bitch is my friend.

43:36.280 --> 43:37.611
And it's over.

43:37.648 --> 43:40.515
Don't do this, Donna, please!

43:40.551 --> 43:42.951
I'm begging you, do not do this.

43:42.987 --> 43:45.251
Or what?!
What are you gonna do?

43:45.289 --> 43:46.813
What're you gonna throw me
up against the wall

43:46.857 --> 43:48.188
like in Portland?

43:48.225 --> 43:50.523
Are you gonna push me down
the stairs like in Palm Springs?

43:50.561 --> 43:52.893
Or do you only hit me
when we're out of town?

43:53.931 --> 43:56.422
I love you, Donna.

43:56.467 --> 43:59.527
Please, you gotta
believe me, please.

44:01.038 --> 44:02.835
Forgive me.

44:02.873 --> 44:06.104

44:06.143 --> 44:09.078

44:09.113 --> 44:10.637

44:20.624 --> 44:22.819

44:22.860 --> 44:26.455
What I regret is I didn't
do this a long time ago.
