01:22.292 --> 01:24.740
Right, I'm gonna
head off now, mom.

01:24.775 --> 01:25.706
All right, darling.

01:25.740 --> 01:26.602
Okay.

01:26.637 --> 01:27.775
Have a lovely time,

01:28.982 --> 01:31.120
well as much as you
can at a funeral.

01:32.947 --> 01:35.568
I just want to pay
my respects, you know.

01:35.602 --> 01:38.706
Oh, honey, you
didn't even know him.

01:43.396 --> 01:48.085
Listen, I love
you very much, okay?

01:48.120 --> 01:49.947
The nurse will be in

01:49.982 --> 01:51.258
if not call me, okay?

01:51.292 --> 01:52.568
I'll be back on Friday,

01:52.602 --> 01:53.533
I'm not sure what
time though so...

01:53.568 --> 01:57.947
Yes, yes, I know, don't worry.

01:57.982 --> 01:58.844
Okay.

01:58.878 --> 01:59.844
I'll see you soon.

02:00.844 --> 02:01.775
I'll see you soon.

02:04.258 --> 02:06.844
Don't forget to check the
oil, its a long journey.

02:06.878 --> 02:08.120
Yeah, already done it.

02:15.844 --> 02:17.844
And Cassy sent
me a list of things

02:17.878 --> 02:19.671
that sunny doesn't like to eat.

02:21.878 --> 02:23.361
Huh?

02:23.396 --> 02:25.982
Cassy is very protective
of her because of her...

02:26.016 --> 02:28.499
Whoa, what's Cassy?

02:30.878 --> 02:33.499
Cassandra, Jason's ex.

02:35.327 --> 02:37.465
I left you a post-it-note.

02:37.499 --> 02:39.396
A post-it-note, where?

02:40.568 --> 02:42.499
Right, okay, start
from the beginning.

02:43.844 --> 02:47.464
You're taking her daughter,
Sunny, to the funeral.

02:48.396 --> 02:49.913
You're driving up together.

02:55.568 --> 02:56.361
Ryan.

02:57.292 --> 02:59.982
No fucking way.

03:00.016 --> 03:01.223
Ryan.

03:01.258 --> 03:02.637
Mom, I don't even
know who Cassandra is,

03:02.671 --> 03:04.016
let alone her daughter

03:04.051 --> 03:05.533
and also this is supposed
to be a solo trip,

03:05.568 --> 03:06.706
that's why I'm
leaving a day early.

03:06.740 --> 03:08.258
That's kinda the point.

03:08.292 --> 03:09.844
Jason's ex-wife.

03:09.878 --> 03:11.085
Who's Jason?

03:11.120 --> 03:14.533
What, aunty Sue's son
Jason, aunty Sue's.

03:14.568 --> 03:18.223
Look, I used to do
pilates with Cassy

03:18.258 --> 03:20.429
and she asked me to do it.

03:20.464 --> 03:23.878
It's a two day
journey to Thurso.

03:23.913 --> 03:27.637
It's miles away, it's
in bloody Scotland,

03:28.982 --> 03:32.706
and Cassandra is so
protective of Sunny,

03:32.740 --> 03:36.533
she wouldn't be comfortablewith her going with anyone else.

03:36.568 --> 03:41.396
And she trusts me
and I trust you.

03:43.154 --> 03:44.878
You're doing this.

03:46.085 --> 03:47.499
I raised a gentleman.

04:07.499 --> 04:10.602
Mom, I don't know
her, it will be awkward.

04:12.740 --> 04:15.395
You're a very
easy-to-talk-to young man.

04:17.361 --> 04:18.499
You're affable.

04:27.051 --> 04:29.499
Fine, fine.

04:31.016 --> 04:34.258
Just text me her address,

04:34.292 --> 04:36.913
don't post me a
bloody post-it-note.

04:36.947 --> 04:39.429
Thank you, take your coat.

04:39.464 --> 04:40.844
- Oh, mom, it's hot.
- Ryan.

04:47.533 --> 04:48.844
I love you.

04:48.878 --> 04:49.775
Love you.

04:57.292 --> 04:58.120
Delicious.

05:00.154 --> 05:01.154
See you, mom.

06:03.533 --> 06:08.464
I'm not letting my daughter
go to Scotland on her own.

06:08.499 --> 06:09.706
What are you thinking?

06:09.740 --> 06:12.775
Our daughter, and she
won't be on her own,

06:12.809 --> 06:14.085
he's a good boy.

06:14.947 --> 06:16.291
Okay, he's a man.

06:17.429 --> 06:19.671
And how do you know
what he's like?

06:19.706 --> 06:21.706
I met him once, he
was five at the time.

06:25.706 --> 06:27.533
What if he mistreats her, Cass?

06:27.568 --> 06:30.844
Jason, stop, he's family.

06:30.878 --> 06:32.637
Is he, is he though?

06:33.809 --> 06:35.878
Listen, this is
hard for me as well,

06:37.051 --> 06:38.533
we have to put our
differences aside

06:38.568 --> 06:40.016
and I think it
might be good for us

06:40.051 --> 06:42.291
to loosen the leash a bit.

06:42.326 --> 06:45.051
She can't look
after herself, Cassy.

06:45.085 --> 06:46.706
She won't be by
herself, Jason.

06:47.947 --> 06:50.809
You know why I'm
letting this happen.

06:50.844 --> 06:51.671
I can't...

06:54.947 --> 06:57.257
I can't have another incident.

06:59.360 --> 07:01.395
It tore you and me apart

07:01.429 --> 07:03.189
and I don't want to
lose her as well.

early start and all.

11:10.499 --> 11:11.844
I got it with milk and sugar

didn't know what you like.

11:16.360 --> 11:17.119
It's good coffee.

11:17.153 --> 11:17.981
I hate coffee.

11:18.981 --> 11:20.809
Oh, okay.

11:20.844 --> 11:21.981
That's fine.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.395
It's hot, isn't it?

11:30.360 --> 11:32.084
It's ah, hey, in a minute,

11:32.119 --> 11:33.981
we could stop for
some ice cream.

11:34.015 --> 11:34.844
Ice cream.

11:37.671 --> 11:40.395
My favorite flavor is
mint chocolate chip.

11:41.464 --> 11:42.360
It's...

11:42.395 --> 11:43.568
Oh, that's rank.

11:54.740 --> 11:55.809
So how are we related then?

11:55.844 --> 11:56.878
What, we're cousins or?

11:56.912 --> 11:58.395
No.

11:58.429 --> 11:59.844
Are you Australian?

11:59.878 --> 12:00.740
Yes.

12:00.775 --> 12:02.015
Why are you Australian?

12:02.050 --> 12:04.084
Because I'm Australian.

12:08.878 --> 12:12.878
My mom's your mom's sister's
ex husband's ex wife.

12:12.912 --> 12:17.533
Oh, okay, so that makes me,

12:17.568 --> 12:22.568
so what we're like second
cousins twice removed?

12:23.326 --> 12:25.119
Or are we even related?

12:25.153 --> 12:30.153
No, that would make me
your ex, ex, cousin-in-law.

12:34.291 --> 12:37.499
Oh, small world.

12:42.119 --> 12:43.429
Our kids would be fine.

12:44.360 --> 12:45.740
Huh?

12:45.775 --> 12:46.912
If we were to have
children together,

12:46.946 --> 12:49.084
they would be
normal, not like me.

12:54.809 --> 12:59.084
Oh, ah, good.

13:01.981 --> 13:02.809
Good.

13:07.499 --> 13:08.464
You're kinda blunt.

13:10.637 --> 13:13.326

14:07.222 --> 14:09.360
Okay, well, I'm hungry.

14:38.015 --> 14:39.429
Yeah, I eat a lot.

14:44.774 --> 14:47.568
So, what do you do?

14:50.568 --> 14:52.843
Like hobbies or?

14:55.739 --> 14:57.671
Come on, man, it's
a two day journey,

14:57.706 --> 15:00.671
just give me
something, anything.

15:00.706 --> 15:01.981
I just, I'm...

15:02.912 --> 15:04.395
Art.

15:04.429 --> 15:06.706
Art, art, okay.

15:07.602 --> 15:10.360
Okay, art, cool.

15:10.395 --> 15:11.706
What kind of art?

15:11.739 --> 15:12.568
Pine cones.

15:15.395 --> 15:16.291
Pine cones?

15:16.326 --> 15:17.291
Mm-hmm.

15:18.464 --> 15:21.050
Yeah, I collect them
from the local forest

15:21.084 --> 15:24.568
and then I spray them with
pesticides and paint them silver.

15:24.602 --> 15:26.533
And then I sell them on eBay

15:26.568 --> 15:29.291
or at a local market with
an older lady called Janice.

15:31.739 --> 15:34.912
Right, okay, and what,
and people buy that?

15:38.188 --> 15:39.808
I mean like, I don't know,

15:39.843 --> 15:40.739
I mean where do you put them?

15:40.774 --> 15:42.533
Like what on the mantle or?

15:42.568 --> 15:46.050
In a bowl, Christmas
time's really good money.

15:46.084 --> 15:47.981
They hang them on the trees.

15:49.671 --> 15:50.499
Oh.

15:54.257 --> 15:55.739
Is there a wake?

15:55.774 --> 15:58.602
After the funeral, a
celebration of death?

15:59.568 --> 16:01.084
What, the wake?

16:01.119 --> 16:04.119
I mean usually it's
celebration of someone's life.

16:07.119 --> 16:08.981
Yeah, but in this case
it's a celebration of death

16:09.015 --> 16:12.222
because it's good that
he's dead, because

16:13.981 --> 16:15.119
I guess it could be both.

16:15.153 --> 16:17.912
Wow, okay, what'd
he do to you?

16:17.946 --> 16:18.912
Well no, I don't know him,

16:18.946 --> 16:20.326
I just know he was an alcoholic.

16:20.360 --> 16:21.739
So?

16:21.774 --> 16:23.464
So he's like my
neighbor's cat.

16:24.946 --> 16:27.429
It was old and it
couldn't breath

16:27.464 --> 16:29.429
and they just kept it alive.

16:29.464 --> 16:31.257
So I put it to sleep.

16:31.291 --> 16:32.429
Snapped its neck.

16:36.291 --> 16:38.946
You, what does that have to,

16:38.981 --> 16:41.533
wait, what, you
snapped its neck?

16:41.568 --> 16:42.636
Yeah, it was quick.

16:44.015 --> 16:47.050
That's not your
decision to make.

16:47.084 --> 16:49.360
Well, it was the right one.

16:52.257 --> 16:53.326
Wow, okay.

16:59.360 --> 17:01.015
You snapped its neck?

17:03.188 --> 17:04.808
You snapped its neck?

17:05.843 --> 17:07.773
You snapped a cat's neck.

17:07.808 --> 17:10.222
Yes.

17:13.945 --> 17:14.773
Stop that.

17:20.188 --> 17:21.015
Stop.

17:25.015 --> 17:26.015
Hey, hey, hold on.

17:27.015 --> 17:28.290
Wait for the second click.

17:50.464 --> 17:51.808
So autism.

17:53.257 --> 17:55.601
That is, I mean, hey, so
that's why you don't talk.

17:55.636 --> 17:57.877
Or you struggle to talk.

17:59.222 --> 18:01.670
I mean I don't know
much about autism.

18:01.705 --> 18:02.877
What is it you can't do?

18:04.050 --> 18:06.015
And also, like when you
get like a boyfriend,

18:06.050 --> 18:10.429
or such, are they
like autistic too?

18:12.119 --> 18:13.395
What?

18:13.429 --> 18:15.050
So, are they like,

18:17.739 --> 18:20.395
are they like autistic too?

18:21.601 --> 18:24.222
Why do they have
to be autistic?

18:24.257 --> 18:26.981
Well, because then, you
know, you've both got autism.

18:28.567 --> 18:29.877
And then when we come together

18:29.912 --> 18:32.429
we glow as our
autism intensifies?

18:34.429 --> 18:35.257
No, no, no.

18:37.084 --> 18:38.532
Come on, I mean like,

18:38.567 --> 18:40.808
so for example, you couldn't
flirt with someone like me,

18:40.843 --> 18:44.222
because that's me
taking advantage of you,

18:44.257 --> 18:48.601
because, you know,
you're disabled.

18:48.636 --> 18:51.257
Are you fucking
serious right now?

18:51.291 --> 18:52.119
What?

18:53.257 --> 18:55.222
First of all,
autism is something

18:55.257 --> 18:56.532
that affects how easy it is

18:56.567 --> 18:58.188
to form a relationship
with someone,

18:58.222 --> 19:00.808
so while I might be at a
biological disadvantage,

19:00.843 --> 19:03.567
there's still 100% more
likely to get laid than you.

19:03.601 --> 19:04.429
Second of all...

19:04.464 --> 19:05.257
Whoa, I didn't mean...

19:05.291 --> 19:07.084
Do I not have a brain?

19:07.119 --> 19:08.291
- Can I not say no?
- Yeah, no, of course.

19:08.326 --> 19:10.636
I'm not incapable, if
I wanna talk to a guy,

19:10.670 --> 19:12.291
then I will when I'm ready.

19:12.326 --> 19:13.601
- Yeah, of course.
- If I want to be

19:14.981 --> 19:16.153
- spontaneous then I will.
- I didn't say, I didn't mean.

19:16.188 --> 19:17.498
Of course, I didn't, what?

19:17.532 --> 19:19.981
That's fine, literally
I'm just saying

19:20.015 --> 19:23.326
I'm unfamiliar
with the condition.

19:23.360 --> 19:24.257
Clearly I've struck a nerve.

19:24.291 --> 19:25.498
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19:27.877 --> 19:29.015
Undo your trousers,
I'll toss you off.

19:29.050 --> 19:30.360
What the fuck?

19:30.395 --> 19:32.119
I want to, you're not
taking advantage of me.

19:32.153 --> 19:33.946
What the hell is going on?

19:33.981 --> 19:35.395
I have something to prove.

19:35.429 --> 19:38.291
No, no, you don't, you
have nothing to prove.

19:38.326 --> 19:39.808
You have nothing to prove.

19:45.015 --> 19:47.532
Jesus Christ.

19:47.567 --> 19:49.498
Careful, there's
incoming traffic.

19:52.636 --> 19:53.636
It was stationary.

19:58.636 --> 19:59.532
Am I raping you?

20:02.050 --> 20:06.188
No, you just have
nothing to prove.

20:06.222 --> 20:07.498
I wasn't even, I didn't.

20:09.843 --> 20:12.119
I actually want to do it.

20:17.705 --> 20:20.705
It's okay, I just,
I wasn't ready.

20:40.463 --> 20:42.291
I just can't believe
how ignorant you are.

20:48.153 --> 20:49.360
Well, I've got some good news,

20:49.394 --> 20:51.188
the breathalyzer
came back negative,

20:51.222 --> 20:53.015
which I found a
little surprising.

20:53.050 --> 20:55.843
I mean you were veering
all over the road.

20:55.877 --> 20:58.084
You weren't on your mobile
by any chance, were you, sir?

20:58.119 --> 21:01.257
No, sorry, I was distracted.

21:02.567 --> 21:03.601
Distracted?

21:04.877 --> 21:07.188
Okay, well, I won't
detain you any longer.

21:07.222 --> 21:08.428
Final word of advice,

21:08.463 --> 21:10.359
the cars do tend
to fly along here,

21:10.394 --> 21:12.946
just be a little careful
when you pull off, alright?

21:24.843 --> 21:28.326
♪ I can't see all
obstacles in my way ♪

21:37.359 --> 21:39.050
Do you know this guy?

21:39.084 --> 21:40.532
Who?

21:40.567 --> 21:42.084
The guy whose funeral it is?

21:43.325 --> 21:44.119
No.

21:47.498 --> 21:50.567
But he's family and
family is family, I guess.

21:51.532 --> 21:53.291
Yeah I guess.

21:53.325 --> 21:55.739
I think I need my SATNAV.

21:55.774 --> 21:57.912
He killed himself, you know?

21:57.946 --> 21:59.498
Yeah, no, I heard.

22:02.705 --> 22:04.325
Why did he kill himself?

22:04.359 --> 22:05.946
Why are we talking about this?

22:08.050 --> 22:08.877
Sorry.

22:10.015 --> 22:11.257
Well, yeah, it's just
so heavy, isn't it?

22:11.291 --> 22:13.946
Like, I mean how can
I even answer that?

22:13.981 --> 22:15.119
I don't know, I just,

22:16.601 --> 22:19.739
maybe people feel like they
fuck up one too many times,

22:19.774 --> 22:21.084
I don't know.

22:21.119 --> 22:24.394
Yeah but everybody
fucks up, right?

22:25.359 --> 22:26.601
Yeah, I guess so.

22:26.636 --> 22:27.601
I mean, everybody
does stupid shit.

22:27.636 --> 22:28.774
Like my friend, Carly,

22:28.808 --> 22:31.153
she let a guy give
her a mushroom stamp.

22:31.188 --> 22:32.808
Oh yeah, what's that?

22:32.843 --> 22:33.981
A mushroom stamp?

22:34.015 --> 22:35.222
Yeah?

22:35.257 --> 22:37.119
It's when a guy grabs
the stem of his penis

22:37.153 --> 22:38.808
and he dabs his balls into shit

22:38.843 --> 22:42.119
and then he gently presses it
on the other person's forehead

22:42.153 --> 22:45.222
like a stamp, a mushroom stamp.

22:46.912 --> 22:49.015
Oh right, yeah,
no, that makes sense.

22:51.532 --> 22:52.498
That's fucking vile.

22:53.498 --> 22:55.636
Yeah, well, it's not my thing.

Oh, yeah, nah, I didn't
get much sleep last night.

23:23.912 --> 23:25.705
And I've fucking
cum, haven't I? So.

23:26.877 --> 23:28.705
Well, we should stop
at the first hotel.

23:29.739 --> 23:30.981
Yeah, we could,

23:31.015 --> 23:32.946
but we're still over a
hundred miles away, so.

23:35.188 --> 23:36.015
Why so far?

23:37.050 --> 23:38.290
'Cause it's long way to go.

23:38.325 --> 23:40.532
I just want to push on,
just get there quicker.

23:40.567 --> 23:41.394
Okay.

23:43.290 --> 23:44.808
But there's no rush, but okay.

23:49.739 --> 23:51.084
Oh, shit.

24:32.463 --> 24:33.290
Oh, shit.

24:36.256 --> 24:38.428
Yeah, he put diesel in it.

24:41.084 --> 24:43.325
Yeah, I know it's color coded.

24:43.359 --> 24:44.428
I was surprised too.

24:45.877 --> 24:48.187
He said the car would
be ready to go tomorrow.

24:52.290 --> 24:56.187
It's okay, it's
like a B&B place.

24:56.221 --> 24:57.601
There's a toilet and a sink.

24:59.463 --> 25:03.290
It's kinda like the one
outta that movie "Psycho".

25:03.325 --> 25:04.498
Anyway, mom, I gotta go.

25:07.981 --> 25:11.877
Bye, yeah, bye, bye.

25:19.015 --> 25:23.187
I hate people that
say bye three times.

25:23.221 --> 25:25.670
Yeah, it's
inefficient, isn't it?

25:26.808 --> 25:28.946
Bye, it's meant to be the end.

25:28.981 --> 25:30.428
Like bye.

25:31.636 --> 25:32.498
Bye.

25:51.325 --> 25:53.843
What the hell's going on now?

25:57.877 --> 25:58.946
Are you okay?

26:04.083 --> 26:05.705
Sometimes I cry.

26:09.705 --> 26:13.359
This place is so dirty,
do you have gloves?

26:13.394 --> 26:15.670
Ah no, no this is
all I could afford

26:15.705 --> 26:16.843
at last minute notice.

26:20.256 --> 26:21.739
I think I might sneeze.

26:23.532 --> 26:24.428
Okay, go on then.

26:29.428 --> 26:30.256
Not now.

26:32.946 --> 26:33.774
Okay.

26:41.877 --> 26:43.049
What does your mom do?

26:45.221 --> 26:46.463
Not much at the moment.

26:47.774 --> 26:48.601
Is she lazy?

26:50.394 --> 26:51.601
No, she's got cancer.

26:53.221 --> 26:56.843
Oh, I hope she
gets through it okay.

26:56.877 --> 26:58.877
You live with her don't you?

26:58.912 --> 27:00.187
- Mm-hmm.
- She must really hate

27:00.221 --> 27:02.049
that you've come to
this man's funeral.

27:03.636 --> 27:05.428
But as I said, it's good.

27:05.463 --> 27:06.808
He's family and family's family

27:06.843 --> 27:09.774

First shag then?

30:45.118 --> 30:45.945
First shag?

30:47.532 --> 30:50.083
Ashleigh Moore, I was 16.

30:50.118 --> 30:52.807
Yeah, lost my virginity same
day as my mate, Sandeep.

30:52.842 --> 30:53.636
Lads, lads, lads.

30:55.601 --> 30:56.636
I was 14.

30:56.670 --> 30:58.428
14? I hope he was as well.

30:58.463 --> 30:59.359
He was 13.

30:59.394 --> 31:00.601
13?

31:00.636 --> 31:02.739
What's with the
pink steering wheel?

31:02.773 --> 31:05.601
Jesus, you've perked
up since yesterday.

31:05.636 --> 31:07.601
It's good, the pink
steering wheel,

31:07.636 --> 31:10.601
it's, oh well,
it's ironic really.

31:10.636 --> 31:13.980
Is it, don't most people
think that it's gay?

31:14.014 --> 31:15.290
Yeah.

31:15.325 --> 31:16.670
Is that the irony,
that you're not gay?

31:16.705 --> 31:17.945
Yeah.

31:17.980 --> 31:19.463
So it's like you're so manly

31:19.498 --> 31:21.705
that you can drive around
with a pink steering wheel?

31:21.739 --> 31:22.567
Yeah.

31:23.807 --> 31:24.773
Are you gay?

31:24.807 --> 31:26.290
Yeah, ah, no.

31:26.325 --> 31:28.601
Is that a cock
on your key chain?

31:28.636 --> 31:30.325
Yeah, no, I'm not gay.

31:31.911 --> 31:32.738
I'm not gay.

31:34.187 --> 31:35.980
Well if that's not gay,
then that definitely is gay.

31:36.014 --> 31:37.670
That's, I'm not, shit.

31:44.083 --> 31:44.876
Shit.

31:53.187 --> 31:54.152

31:54.187 --> 31:55.083
- I honestly...
- Hey.

31:55.118 --> 31:56.325
Don't touch my fucking car.

31:56.359 --> 31:57.636
What the fuck are you
doing on the road?

31:57.670 --> 31:58.842
I'm so sorry, it's
completely my fault.

31:58.876 --> 32:00.152
Of course it's
your fucking fault.

32:00.187 --> 32:00.911
Hey, are you going
to pay for this?

32:00.945 --> 32:02.532
Pay for what?

32:02.567 --> 32:04.498
Are you demented, it's dented.

32:06.359 --> 32:07.498
No, it's not.

32:07.532 --> 32:08.670
You want to play big man,

32:08.704 --> 32:10.152
just because you do
50KG on a bench press?

32:10.187 --> 32:11.325
Hey, do you wanna fight?

32:11.359 --> 32:12.670
Do you wanna fight, you
fucking cocky prick?

32:12.704 --> 32:13.807
No, no, of course I
don't want to fight,

32:13.842 --> 32:15.842
I don't want any
trouble, please, I just.

32:16.842 --> 32:19.807
Wait, 50KG?

32:19.842 --> 32:21.290
I mean add a one
in front of that.

32:21.325 --> 32:23.842
Actually my PB was 140,
although my form was terrible.

32:23.876 --> 32:24.738
So on paper...

32:24.773 --> 32:26.290
You fucking smart aleck, hey?

32:26.325 --> 32:27.118
No, I don't know
why I said that.

32:27.152 --> 32:27.980
I'm so sorry.

32:29.325 --> 32:30.152
Hit him.

32:31.876 --> 32:33.394
Let's just move on
with our day, okay?

32:33.428 --> 32:35.221
Because I'm taking full
responsibly for this,

32:35.256 --> 32:36.083
I'm so sorry.

32:36.945 --> 32:38.498
No, that was so uncalled for.

32:40.567 --> 32:43.152
Twat, give me your
details, you prick.

32:44.945 --> 32:45.773
Oh.

32:50.636 --> 32:52.049
You want to fucking fight?

32:53.463 --> 32:54.532
Do you want to fucking fight?

32:54.567 --> 32:55.876
- No, no.
- You got the wrong

32:55.911 --> 32:57.221
fucking guy today.

32:57.256 --> 32:59.911
Oh!

33:01.152 --> 33:01.911
I didn't...

33:01.945 --> 33:04.532
Don't, don't.

33:04.567 --> 33:05.428
Sorry.

33:08.807 --> 33:09.635
What was that?

33:10.773 --> 33:12.256
You struggle to
have a conversation

33:12.290 --> 33:14.911
but you'll happily punch a man
in the spine for no reason?

33:14.945 --> 33:16.152
Well, I didn't like the
way he was talking to you.

33:16.187 --> 33:18.532
Yeah, but that's my problem.

33:18.567 --> 33:19.738
It's not your problem.

33:23.532 --> 33:25.325
My heart rate is
through the roof.

33:26.567 --> 33:28.498
But in like an exciting way.

33:28.532 --> 33:29.773
Not like when you go swimming

33:29.807 --> 33:31.083
and sometimes you hold
your breath underwater

33:31.118 --> 33:33.635
and it gets to a point
where you're like

33:33.669 --> 33:35.669
just a few more seconds
and I'm a goner.

33:37.290 --> 33:38.669
What?

33:38.704 --> 33:40.187
Do you like swimming?

33:40.221 --> 33:41.325
Nah, I never learnt.

33:44.014 --> 33:45.635
Where are we stopping tonight?

33:45.669 --> 33:46.498
Newcastle.

33:48.842 --> 33:50.428
Is it nice?

33:50.463 --> 33:52.980
Yeah, you never been?

33:57.187 --> 34:00.118
You know there will
be some nice bars.

34:00.152 --> 34:01.152
We could grab a drink?

34:02.290 --> 34:04.428
I know I could
certainly use one.

34:04.463 --> 34:05.290
I don't drink.

34:06.567 --> 34:08.498
What, not even orange juice?

34:08.532 --> 34:11.118
No, well, obviously
I drink orange juice.

34:11.152 --> 34:12.324
Well then fine,

34:12.359 --> 34:14.359
then we'll pump you
full of shoog, won't we?

34:14.393 --> 34:15.635
Really?

34:15.668 --> 34:17.152
Yeah.

34:17.187 --> 34:18.600
Like a legitimate bar,
where there's bar fights?

34:18.635 --> 34:21.806
Ah, I bloody hope not.

34:31.806 --> 34:34.565
Awesome, there we
go, are you good?

34:36.565 --> 34:37.773
Yeah.

34:37.806 --> 34:42.393
Oh, excuse me, can I
have a whisky, please?

34:42.428 --> 34:44.668
Because, because why not?

34:46.014 --> 34:47.187
And an orange juice, please.

34:47.221 --> 34:48.152
No worries.

34:48.187 --> 34:49.083
Cheers, man, thank you.

34:52.531 --> 34:54.324
This place is incredible.

34:54.359 --> 34:56.806
Alright darling, fancy a ride?

34:56.842 --> 34:59.049
I've never been
anywhere like this before.

35:02.600 --> 35:03.842
It's just a Monday.

35:07.014 --> 35:08.635
It does smell funny.

35:08.669 --> 35:09.498
It sure does.

35:10.566 --> 35:12.738
Cheers man, thank you so much.

35:12.773 --> 35:13.600
Thank you.

35:14.911 --> 35:15.738
Cheers.

35:27.428 --> 35:28.531
Can I tell you something?

35:32.566 --> 35:37.290
You are genuinely one of
the most interesting people

35:37.325 --> 35:38.290
I've ever met.

35:41.083 --> 35:43.014
Sorry, I'll try to
stop talking so much.

35:43.049 --> 35:44.911
No, no, hey,
it's a good thing,

35:44.945 --> 35:46.325
it's a great thing.

35:47.704 --> 35:49.876
It's awesome, you're so
quirky without even trying.

35:49.911 --> 35:51.256
It's awesome.

35:52.118 --> 35:53.497
You're genuinely very funny.

35:56.773 --> 35:58.566
Is this because I
killed the neighbor's cat?

35:58.600 --> 36:02.462
No, stay away from my pets,

36:02.497 --> 36:03.945
but stuff like that,

36:03.980 --> 36:06.876
stuff like that, like you do
what most people wouldn't.

36:06.911 --> 36:11.911
Despite it probably being
the kinda right thing to do.

36:16.118 --> 36:17.256
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

36:18.152 --> 36:19.807
I killed that cat real good.

36:19.842 --> 36:21.773
Yeah, again, the
cat thing is kind of

36:21.807 --> 36:23.462
- like a bad thing.
- Would you lie to me?

36:24.980 --> 36:26.566
About what?

36:26.600 --> 36:27.462
Anything.

36:28.359 --> 36:29.290
I don't know, probably.

36:29.325 --> 36:30.773
No, I don't think you would.

36:32.462 --> 36:33.566
I mean, I have no reason to.

36:33.600 --> 36:35.911
If you're being
annoying, I'll tell you.

36:35.945 --> 36:40.427
Okay, I just wish that
sometimes people were as blunt

36:40.462 --> 36:41.704
with me as I am them.

36:42.807 --> 36:44.462
It's just that my parents, they,

36:45.807 --> 36:47.497
well they don't really think
that I can handle life,

36:47.531 --> 36:50.427
so they don't let
me do anything.

36:50.462 --> 36:52.531
But then how are you
going to live and learn

36:52.566 --> 36:55.635
if they don't let
you live and learn?

37:02.704 --> 37:06.497
Yes, did you just come
up with that on your own?

37:07.394 --> 37:09.152
Yeah, I guess.

37:09.187 --> 37:12.497
Wow, can you tell
my parents that?

37:12.531 --> 37:15.118
No, no, that's for you to do.

37:15.152 --> 37:18.014
Well I do, but
then I get angry,

37:18.049 --> 37:19.980
and then they pass
that off as rage,

37:20.014 --> 37:22.221
which is commonly
associated with autism,

37:22.256 --> 37:23.842
but it's actually not that.

37:23.876 --> 37:25.427
It's just the way that I feel.

37:29.049 --> 37:30.911
I don't know, man,
it sounds tough.

37:35.118 --> 37:36.359
I mean they let you
come with me, though?

37:36.393 --> 37:38.807
That's, I mean, oh,
that's huge, surely.

37:38.842 --> 37:40.876
Yeah, but that was
for the wrong reasons.

37:43.427 --> 37:46.807
Well, because I was in an
accident not that long ago,

37:46.842 --> 37:48.531
so it just made
them worry about me

37:48.566 --> 37:50.118
even more than they already do.

37:52.221 --> 37:53.497
But they knew that
I had to do this

37:53.531 --> 37:56.049
that I had to just
get out and do it.

37:59.773 --> 38:01.358
Yeah, I don't know.

38:09.600 --> 38:14.600
Hey, how would you
like the tiniest,

38:16.221 --> 38:20.704
tiniest bit of prosecco
in your orange juice?

38:21.566 --> 38:22.876
The tiniest bit.

38:25.256 --> 38:26.187
No.

38:26.221 --> 38:27.738
No?

38:27.773 --> 38:31.669
No, it's just,
what's that drink?

38:31.704 --> 38:32.531
- Mimosa.
- It's just a,

38:32.566 --> 38:34.187
oh, it's a mimosa.

38:34.221 --> 38:36.049
It's just a mimosa.

38:40.876 --> 38:44.704
Come on, a little mimosa,
wanna little mimosa?

38:47.980 --> 38:48.773
Little, just a little?

38:48.807 --> 38:49.600
Yes.

38:49.635 --> 38:50.600
Yes?

38:50.635 --> 38:51.462
Yes.

38:51.497 --> 38:52.462
Yes?

38:52.497 --> 38:53.290
Yes!

38:53.324 --> 38:54.118
Yes!

38:54.152 --> 38:55.049
Yes.

38:55.083 --> 38:56.324
One mimosa please, sir.

38:57.669 --> 38:59.152
And one more whisky please, sir.

38:59.187 --> 39:00.427
Coming right up.

39:00.462 --> 39:01.704
No, no, no, I'm
driving tomorrow,

39:01.738 --> 39:04.635
so it's probably best
I kinda call it quits.

39:05.531 --> 39:07.427
Sexy, baby!

39:08.945 --> 39:09.911
No.

39:09.945 --> 39:11.807
Yes, yes.

39:11.842 --> 39:13.049
No.

39:13.083 --> 39:14.738
Yeah, you've got
them big teeth.

39:16.187 --> 39:17.083
You like them?

39:17.118 --> 39:19.152
Oh, yeah, they are like mine.

39:19.187 --> 39:20.427
Look at my front two teeth,

39:20.462 --> 39:24.014
they're big like plates.

39:24.049 --> 39:26.014
Wow, big.

39:26.049 --> 39:28.669
Yeah, thanks, I
grew them myself.

39:29.669 --> 39:31.187
So how come you're Austrian?

39:31.221 --> 39:33.187
Ah, ah,

39:33.221 --> 39:34.531
Australian?

39:34.566 --> 39:35.358
Dad.

39:35.393 --> 39:36.635
Dad?

39:36.669 --> 39:38.358
You know I can do the accent?

39:38.393 --> 39:41.427
No you can't, everyone thinksthat they can but you can't.

39:41.462 --> 39:42.427
No, I can, I can.

39:42.462 --> 39:44.083
Listen, are you ready?

39:45.945 --> 39:48.531
Ah, see them girls over there?

39:48.566 --> 39:50.945
Ah, yeah, I'm
gonna go kiss them.

39:50.980 --> 39:52.187
I'm gonna go kiss them.

39:53.393 --> 39:54.358
No.

39:54.393 --> 39:55.289
No?

39:55.324 --> 39:56.669
Yeah, that was...

39:56.704 --> 39:58.049
- Yeah?
- That was pretty good.

39:58.083 --> 39:59.842
Yeah, I was good, see?

39:59.876 --> 40:02.152
Yeah.

40:05.427 --> 40:07.118
One more round, officer.

40:07.152 --> 40:10.324
No, no, no, please
no, please no.

40:18.152 --> 40:21.289
So how come you had boyfriends,

40:21.324 --> 40:23.187
but you're not allowed
out of the house?

40:25.220 --> 40:28.427
I did it before that they
thought that I would want to.

40:29.393 --> 40:30.876
So it was out of spite.

40:33.773 --> 40:34.600
Spite.

40:35.669 --> 40:36.738
Whoa, well.

40:42.531 --> 40:43.635
Would you date me?

40:43.669 --> 40:45.186
No.

40:45.220 --> 40:46.255
No, no.

40:46.289 --> 40:47.911
- Why?
- No, no, no, no, no.

40:47.945 --> 40:49.531
Why not?

40:49.566 --> 40:50.393
No.

40:51.842 --> 40:53.014
Why not?

40:53.049 --> 40:55.014
Too much work,
you're too much work.

40:55.049 --> 40:55.842
Give me a kiss.

40:55.876 --> 40:56.842
No, no.

40:56.876 --> 40:58.049
Kiss, kiss.

40:58.083 --> 40:58.876
No.

40:58.911 --> 40:59.704
Kiss.

41:01.393 --> 41:02.220
No.

41:04.566 --> 41:05.427
Hmm.

41:07.289 --> 41:08.083
- Ugh.
- Now me.

41:08.118 --> 41:09.118
That's gross.

41:09.152 --> 41:09.980
Me.

41:28.427 --> 41:30.773
No, we can't do
this, we're family.

41:31.980 --> 41:32.773
What?

41:32.807 --> 41:34.049
We're family.

41:34.083 --> 41:36.427
No, what, I gave
you the hand job.

41:36.462 --> 41:38.324
The good old fashion.

41:46.842 --> 41:49.255
I think she might be retarted.

41:49.289 --> 41:50.083
Oh, no.

41:53.255 --> 41:54.876
We both wanted it.

41:54.911 --> 41:55.738
Cool.

42:01.807 --> 42:06.151
We're not family,
it wasn't sexual.

42:07.427 --> 42:08.980
Okay.

42:17.117 --> 42:17.945

45:10.600 --> 45:11.462
Ow.

45:14.807 --> 45:16.358
He's going where we're going.

45:20.013 --> 45:24.462
So he is, well let's
pick him up then.

45:25.497 --> 45:27.255
What, wait, why?

45:27.289 --> 45:28.151
Well, why not?

45:28.186 --> 45:29.635
We're going to the same place.

45:29.669 --> 45:30.979
I'll just take a turn up
here and we'll go get him.

45:31.013 --> 45:33.151
No, what, why would we, no!

45:33.186 --> 45:34.635
Why not?

45:34.669 --> 45:36.566
He's in a wheel chair, he'd
probably really appreciate it.

45:36.600 --> 45:39.082
Well, he got there
somehow on his own.

45:39.117 --> 45:39.944
So?

45:40.944 --> 45:42.117
So what if he smells?

45:42.151 --> 45:43.497
He won't smell.

45:44.497 --> 45:46.358
Well what if he's dirty?

45:46.393 --> 45:47.497
So he's dirty.

45:48.497 --> 45:50.220
Well what if he kills us?

45:50.255 --> 45:51.497
Well, he won't kill us.

45:51.531 --> 45:53.393
Obviously I'll get out
and I'll suss him out.

45:53.427 --> 45:55.875
If he's got a dodgy vibe,
I won't let him in the car.

46:00.427 --> 46:03.013
Well this was just
meant to be the two of us.

46:03.048 --> 46:04.979
It was just meant
to be the one of us.

46:22.358 --> 46:25.013
Hey, yeah, we're
going past Thurso,

46:25.048 --> 46:27.151
so if you want a lift,
you can come with us?

46:27.186 --> 46:29.013
Yeah, no worries.

46:29.048 --> 46:30.393
I'll take your stuff
to the car, yeah.

46:43.704 --> 46:45.773
There we go, there we go.

47:25.875 --> 47:27.117
Well can we drop him off soon?

47:27.151 --> 47:30.531
Sunny, sorry, sorry.

47:32.497 --> 47:33.324
Whats your name?

47:35.600 --> 47:36.497
What's your name?

47:42.531 --> 47:43.462
Cool, cool.

47:47.013 --> 47:48.566
I think he's deaf or mute.

47:50.635 --> 47:52.289
Well, then why
are you whispering?

47:55.531 --> 47:56.738
What's wrong with your leg?

47:56.772 --> 48:00.082
Sunny, Sunny, you
can't just ask that.

48:00.117 --> 48:01.566
Well he can't hear me.

48:01.600 --> 48:03.324
Well then why are you even
asking in the first place?

48:03.358 --> 48:04.635
'Cause it's all bloody.

48:09.151 --> 48:10.186
Sorry, she's just,

48:11.358 --> 48:13.875
she's asking what's
happened to your leg?

48:49.427 --> 48:52.497
Yeah, I mean yeah,
fair, that's fair.

48:55.979 --> 49:00.186
Legs, legs, there you go.

49:11.427 --> 49:13.737
But why can't I just go
at the side of the road?

49:13.772 --> 49:14.566
It's too public.

49:14.600 --> 49:16.531
I'm bursting.

49:18.289 --> 49:20.289
Just go there.

49:21.255 --> 49:23.737
They better not make me pay.

49:28.186 --> 49:28.979
Okay.

49:33.082 --> 49:34.531
Mate do you want?

49:34.566 --> 49:35.600
Nope, okay.

49:38.358 --> 49:39.635
Yeah?

49:39.668 --> 49:40.497
He's scary.

49:43.255 --> 49:44.324
He's not scary.

49:44.358 --> 49:45.186
He is.

49:46.566 --> 49:49.186
Mate, he's asleep and he
can barely move, bless him.

49:52.566 --> 49:55.082
Hey, look at me.

49:55.117 --> 49:56.048
Look at me.

49:56.910 --> 49:59.186
I'll be right in there, okay.

49:59.220 --> 50:02.531
You know I wouldn't let anythinghappen to you, I promise.

50:02.566 --> 50:03.427
Trust me.

50:11.427 --> 50:14.393
I think he needs
a name, don't you?

50:17.427 --> 50:18.255
Jack.

50:20.048 --> 50:22.772
Jack, well that's
a great name, yeah.

50:25.151 --> 50:26.324
I'll be right in there.

50:26.358 --> 50:27.910
I've gotta go I'm
going to burst, yeah?

51:03.944 --> 51:05.117
You alright?

51:18.462 --> 51:23.151
Hey, there's a
guy in the urinals,

51:25.048 --> 51:28.013
I don't think he is actually
even using the toilet.

51:29.599 --> 51:30.668
Oh, shit.

51:30.703 --> 51:32.255
What's your favorite color?

51:32.289 --> 51:33.117
Sunny.

51:33.151 --> 51:35.048
Red, red, hold on.

51:35.082 --> 51:37.082
It's red, what color is it?

51:38.668 --> 51:39.497
Ginger?

51:40.530 --> 51:41.358
Ginger, ginger?

51:43.634 --> 51:45.324
His favorite color is ginger.

51:48.875 --> 51:50.737
Sunny, Sunny, Sunny.

51:57.668 --> 52:00.944
No, ah, Sunny.

52:00.979 --> 52:03.772
Sunny, yes, yes.

52:05.220 --> 52:08.048
Yes, yes, N-N-Y.

52:15.289 --> 52:17.599
Ah, okay, thank you, Jack.

52:19.186 --> 52:20.634
Yeah, so Jack,

52:20.668 --> 52:21.841
we're probably going to have
to drop you off soon, mate

52:21.875 --> 52:24.013
because, you know,
we're nearly there.

52:24.048 --> 52:25.841
We're not there.

52:25.875 --> 52:30.220
Yeah, no, I know, but we needto prepare for the funeral.

52:30.255 --> 52:32.151
What, why?

52:32.186 --> 52:33.875
You know, mentally.

52:35.358 --> 52:36.324
Mentally.

52:36.358 --> 52:37.530
Yeah.

52:37.565 --> 52:38.427
I don't get it.

52:40.048 --> 52:41.082
I just think we should
drop him off soon.

52:41.117 --> 52:42.186
- Okay?
- Why?

52:43.151 --> 52:46.703
Because he might not be safe.

52:46.737 --> 52:48.530
But you said he
wasn't dangerous.

52:48.565 --> 52:49.461
Yeah, well I don't
know that, do I?

52:49.496 --> 52:51.117
Why are you whispering?

52:51.151 --> 52:52.461
What has changed?

52:52.496 --> 52:55.082
Nothing's changed,
nothing's changed.

52:55.117 --> 52:57.910
Well he's fine,
he's been fine to us.

52:57.944 --> 53:01.220
Yeah, okay, yeah.

53:01.255 --> 53:02.530
You hate Jack.

53:02.565 --> 53:05.082
I don't hate Jack,
I don't hate Jack,

53:05.117 --> 53:10.117
I just, you know, you've
been talking to him a lot,

53:10.979 --> 53:11.772
which is great, which is great,

53:13.875 --> 53:17.220
it just means you're not
talking to me as much now.

53:17.255 --> 53:18.255
So you're jealous?

53:19.634 --> 53:20.875
No.

53:20.910 --> 53:22.634
That you don't have a
disability like we do.

53:22.668 --> 53:23.634
What, no, no.

53:24.772 --> 53:26.979
It's just that I like
to talk to someone.

53:27.910 --> 53:28.772
What?

53:28.806 --> 53:29.910
You don't have to whisper.

53:34.255 --> 53:36.944
Well, I like Jack, we
have something in common.

53:36.979 --> 53:38.910
He finds it hard to communicate

53:38.944 --> 53:40.634
and I find it hard
to communicate.

53:44.358 --> 53:48.393
Okay, alright, I'm sorry.

53:48.426 --> 53:51.151
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

53:51.186 --> 53:53.117
Okay, Jack, we'll carry on.

53:53.151 --> 53:55.048
We're all good, you know.

53:56.151 --> 53:56.979
We'll keep going.

54:00.772 --> 54:02.461
I kinda like
that you're jelly.

54:33.426 --> 54:35.668
There we go, there we go.

54:41.324 --> 54:42.151
Okay?

54:43.530 --> 54:44.599
Nice.

54:44.634 --> 54:47.117
Bye Jack, thank you.

54:47.151 --> 54:47.979
See you, Jack.

54:49.565 --> 54:52.013
No worries, pleasure.

54:52.048 --> 54:53.048
Nice to meet you.

55:02.772 --> 55:03.668
Hey, Simon.

55:03.703 --> 55:05.944
For fuck sake, look at you.

55:08.910 --> 55:12.117
I got a little something thatwould make you feel better.

55:13.255 --> 55:14.082
Ah, yeah.

55:17.186 --> 55:19.289
Come on, let's
get you over here.

55:43.117 --> 55:44.220
We did a good thing.

55:51.565 --> 55:52.392
Huh.

56:00.944 --> 56:03.048
Oh, bloody hell, we're
only 20 minutes away.

56:04.392 --> 56:06.392
Ah, but the
funeral's tomorrow.

56:06.426 --> 56:07.841
Yeah, I mean we're actually

56:07.875 --> 56:09.186
arriving a lot
later than I planned

56:09.220 --> 56:12.254
but it doesn't matter.

56:13.944 --> 56:14.875
Oh, but your
parents arrive today.

56:14.910 --> 56:15.772
Have you got the address?

56:15.806 --> 56:17.910
I'll whack it in the nav.

56:17.944 --> 56:20.806
Oh, well I was hoping
to stay with you tonight.

56:24.151 --> 56:26.944
Oh, I mean I'm just
staying in my car tonight,

56:26.979 --> 56:28.117
I hadn't booked anywhere.

56:28.151 --> 56:30.254
That's okay,
that's a nice idea.

56:30.288 --> 56:31.117
Yeah?

56:32.288 --> 56:34.737
I mean you've got
to ask your mom.

56:37.910 --> 56:40.151
Can I come back with you?

56:42.013 --> 56:43.461
Again, you've gotta
ask your parents,

56:43.496 --> 56:46.875
I mean that's not my
decision, I can't say.

56:46.910 --> 56:49.186
But you would want me to?

56:50.565 --> 56:51.737
I mean, I don't know,

56:51.772 --> 56:52.668
it's been a long
journey, you know?

56:52.703 --> 56:53.910
And like all the way back

56:53.944 --> 56:55.186
and you going off
on one in my ear

56:55.219 --> 56:57.668
like oh, you know, look
at me, I've got autism.

56:59.151 --> 57:01.979
You know, I'm pretty sick of
it, to be honest, you know.

57:02.013 --> 57:03.288
Pretty bloody sick of it.

57:08.461 --> 57:10.772
Obviously I'm joking.

57:10.806 --> 57:12.910
Obviously, I'd love that.

57:12.944 --> 57:14.496
Ah.

57:14.530 --> 57:15.323
Ah.

57:18.772 --> 57:20.151
Sunny.

57:24.634 --> 57:26.048
Can I tell you something?

57:26.082 --> 57:27.392
Yeah, of course.

57:27.426 --> 57:29.323
I feel very
comfortable around you,

57:30.496 --> 57:33.357
more so than anyone
else, even my parents.

57:33.392 --> 57:34.806
You're very easy to talk to.

57:38.496 --> 57:39.323
I'm glad.

57:42.392 --> 57:43.288
You know that accident

57:43.323 --> 57:45.357
I told you about in the bar?

57:45.392 --> 57:46.219
Ah, yeah?

57:47.634 --> 57:48.530
I nearly died.

57:48.565 --> 57:50.013
Oh, shit.

57:50.048 --> 57:51.806
I cut my wrist.

57:51.841 --> 57:52.634
My parents think
it was an accident

57:52.668 --> 57:54.979
but I did it on purpose.

57:55.013 --> 57:58.323
But in reflection,
it was an accident.

58:00.565 --> 58:01.737
Why would you do that?

58:05.082 --> 58:08.496
I don't know, I guess I wantedto know what would happen.

58:08.530 --> 58:10.737
What, are you fucking nuts?

58:10.772 --> 58:12.634
You want to know
what would happen?

58:12.668 --> 58:13.910
Sunny, I'll tell you
what would happen,

58:13.944 --> 58:16.150
you'd bleed out and
you'd die, you die.

58:16.185 --> 58:18.323
Well, I know you die.

58:18.357 --> 58:19.496
I know you die.

58:19.530 --> 58:20.668
Jesus, no wonder
your parents don't feel

58:20.703 --> 58:21.910
like they can leave you
to do your own thing.

58:21.944 --> 58:23.185
You'll probably go
into the kitchen

58:23.219 --> 58:24.392
and stick your head in
the fucking microwave.

58:24.426 --> 58:25.634
Why are you making
me feel stupid?

58:25.668 --> 58:26.910
I already feel guilty.

58:28.357 --> 58:29.496
I shouldn't have told
you, you don't understand.

58:29.530 --> 58:31.048
And why are you
getting so mad at me?

58:31.082 --> 58:32.116
What have I done wrong?

58:32.150 --> 58:33.530
Nothing, nothing.

58:39.048 --> 58:41.565
I'm sorry it's just thatpeople are so desperate to live

58:41.599 --> 58:44.048
and you're here and you're
fine, you're healthy.

58:45.150 --> 58:46.048
And you're just willing

58:46.082 --> 58:47.565
to give that all up for nothing.

58:47.599 --> 58:50.082
Like there are people that
are far worse off than you

58:50.116 --> 58:53.461
and in comparison you're
fucking fine, you're healthy.

58:53.496 --> 58:57.048
Well, I didn't feel fine
and I didn't feel healthy.

58:57.082 --> 58:58.530
And what about the people
around you, like your family?

58:58.565 --> 59:00.737
The people that spend so
much time to care for you

59:00.772 --> 59:02.185
because they love you?

59:02.219 --> 59:03.910
Like if you killed yourself,
what about them, huh?

59:03.944 --> 59:05.081
Now, how would they feel?

59:05.116 --> 59:06.530
Don't you think that's
fucking selfish?

59:06.565 --> 59:08.496
Well, I didn't have
anything to look forward to.

59:08.530 --> 59:10.910
Well, then get
a fucking hobby.

59:10.944 --> 59:12.150
Stop the car.

59:12.185 --> 59:13.530
Sunny, I'm not
stopping the car.

59:13.565 --> 59:14.496
Stop the car.

59:14.530 --> 59:15.703
Sunny, we're on a main road.

59:15.737 --> 59:17.150
- Stop the fucking car.
- Sunny,

59:17.185 --> 59:19.219
I'm not stopping the car,
we're on a main road.

59:19.254 --> 59:20.634
- Stop the fucking car.
- Sunny, I'm not.

59:20.668 --> 59:23.048
Stop the fucking car,
stop the fucking car.

59:23.081 --> 59:25.703
Stop the fucking car,
stop the fucking car.

59:25.737 --> 59:29.081
- Stop the fucking car.
- Okay, okay, okay.

59:52.944 --> 59:53.875
Shit, shit.

59:55.979 --> 59:56.806
Sunny!

59:58.806 --> 59:59.979
Sunny, please!

01:00:02.461 --> 01:00:03.288
Sunny!

01:00:16.392 --> 01:00:17.703
Oh, shit, Sunny!

01:01:02.081 --> 01:01:04.496
Oh, he can't swim.

01:01:19.668 --> 01:01:20.772
I don't care.

01:01:24.012 --> 01:01:25.323
I didn't say anything.

01:01:25.357 --> 01:01:27.012
Well, why aren't
you saying anything?

01:01:28.565 --> 01:01:30.978
Because in all honesty,
I don't know what to say.

01:01:33.047 --> 01:01:35.461
When we get home are you
going to tell my parents?

01:01:36.875 --> 01:01:39.392
What, that you eventually
stopped me from drowning?

01:01:41.737 --> 01:01:44.116
The thought hadn't
crossed my mind.

01:01:44.150 --> 01:01:47.530
I was still thinking
about how I was drowning.

01:01:47.565 --> 01:01:49.737
No, about how I still
feel this way sometimes

01:01:49.772 --> 01:01:52.565
and I still think like this.

01:01:52.599 --> 01:01:54.081
Well, I don't know,

01:01:54.116 --> 01:01:55.599
I don't want you to have
another accident again, so.

01:01:55.634 --> 01:01:57.116
Well, they won't let me
out of the house if you do.

01:01:57.150 --> 01:01:58.530
Yeah, but you might
die if I don't tell them.

01:01:58.565 --> 01:01:59.841
Well, what's the
point in living

01:01:59.875 --> 01:02:01.806
if I don't have a
bloody life anyway?

01:02:06.599 --> 01:02:09.081
Sunny, I don't know
what you're going through,

01:02:09.116 --> 01:02:10.496
so I don't know what to say.

01:02:13.012 --> 01:02:14.737
But I know what I said earlier,

01:02:17.496 --> 01:02:18.599
it wasn't what I meant.

01:02:20.772 --> 01:02:21.772
And it wasn't right.

01:02:27.426 --> 01:02:30.426
You know I actually did
want to come with you.

01:02:30.461 --> 01:02:31.943
Well not you personally,

01:02:31.978 --> 01:02:34.150
but when I found out that
someone had to get a lift

01:02:34.185 --> 01:02:38.254
from my family, I
jumped at the chance.

01:02:40.288 --> 01:02:42.150
My family make me
feel like an alien.

01:02:44.874 --> 01:02:45.703
I hate it.

01:02:47.012 --> 01:02:50.012
I actually begged and
cried to be the one

01:02:50.047 --> 01:02:51.288
to get the lift with you

01:02:51.323 --> 01:02:52.565
and the only reason
why they said yes

01:02:52.599 --> 01:02:54.150
was because that I said
that I would text them

01:02:54.185 --> 01:02:55.806
every 30 minutes.

01:02:57.150 --> 01:02:59.012
I was so terrified,

01:03:00.496 --> 01:03:01.668
standing out the
front of my house,

01:03:01.703 --> 01:03:03.496
but not as scared as I was

01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:06.116
doing nothing by myself
day in and day out.

01:03:09.874 --> 01:03:12.599
This has been the most
thrilling experience

01:03:12.634 --> 01:03:13.634
of my life.

01:03:18.185 --> 01:03:20.943
Of my life, Ryan.

01:03:20.978 --> 01:03:24.772
A fucking extended road trip.

01:03:24.806 --> 01:03:28.116
I live my life so
planned and organized

01:03:28.150 --> 01:03:29.530
and that has all gone to shit

01:03:29.565 --> 01:03:32.772
and my heart has been
racing majority of the time

01:03:32.806 --> 01:03:36.357
and it has been for the
best and the worst ways

01:03:36.392 --> 01:03:38.323
but I finally feel
like I'm living,

01:03:39.496 --> 01:03:42.496
and that's because I
feel safe with you.

01:03:44.392 --> 01:03:45.496
But the best part is

01:03:46.737 --> 01:03:49.978
that I finally felt
like I'd met someone

01:03:50.012 --> 01:03:53.737
that understood
me, that gets me.

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:01.737
And now I just feel
like an alien again.

01:04:05.461 --> 01:04:06.357
- Sunny...
- And that's why

01:04:06.392 --> 01:04:08.874
I have one friend, Carly.

01:04:08.909 --> 01:04:10.426
And she's been mushroom stamped.

01:04:10.461 --> 01:04:11.840
And it stained her head.

01:04:19.392 --> 01:04:22.116
I won't tell your parents.

01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:25.530
I guess you've got to
make your own decisions

01:04:25.565 --> 01:04:26.496
in life, right?

01:04:28.219 --> 01:04:30.530
But please if you ever,
ever feel like that again,

01:04:30.565 --> 01:04:33.012
please feel like
you can talk to me.

01:04:33.047 --> 01:04:34.530
No, you'll yell.

01:04:35.978 --> 01:04:38.392
No, I won't, I'll listen.

01:04:52.254 --> 01:04:56.703
You know I'm really glad
you've popped up in my life.

01:04:57.736 --> 01:04:59.461
I just don't want to lose you.

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:09.081
You know, you're
really easy to talk to.

01:07:12.288 --> 01:07:15.392
Well, I guess
we're finally here.

01:07:15.426 --> 01:07:16.667
Yeah, I can see my mom.

01:07:25.288 --> 01:07:27.530
I guess we should head in.

01:07:27.565 --> 01:07:28.392
Yeah.

01:07:30.496 --> 01:07:32.461
I'll let you go
be with your family.

01:07:32.496 --> 01:07:33.667
Why, where are you going?

01:07:33.702 --> 01:07:35.081
Oh, I'm gonna hold back,

01:07:35.116 --> 01:07:38.012
I'm not really interested
in the ceremony.

01:07:38.047 --> 01:07:39.978
I can pay my respects
from around here.

01:07:41.150 --> 01:07:41.978
Oh.

01:07:44.805 --> 01:07:45.805
Can I stay with you?

01:07:50.047 --> 01:07:50.874
Yeah.

01:07:58.254 --> 01:07:59.426
Funerals are dumb.

01:08:04.426 --> 01:08:08.081
There's not many
people here for him.

01:08:08.116 --> 01:08:09.461
That doesn't surprise me.

01:08:16.943 --> 01:08:17.770
Sunny!

01:08:23.149 --> 01:08:24.149
Oh, my God, Sunny,

01:08:24.185 --> 01:08:25.770
where the hell have you been?

01:08:25.805 --> 01:08:27.496
You were suppose to
meet us yesterday.

01:08:27.529 --> 01:08:28.357
Sorry.

01:08:29.633 --> 01:08:31.908
What have you
done to your head?

01:08:31.943 --> 01:08:32.943
Are you okay?

01:08:32.978 --> 01:08:35.702
Yes, mom, I'm fine.

01:08:36.633 --> 01:08:38.046
Okay, okay.

01:08:38.943 --> 01:08:39.770
Hi, Ryan.

01:08:41.770 --> 01:08:43.426
Thank you so much for driving.

01:08:43.461 --> 01:08:44.529
It's fine, honestly.

01:08:45.874 --> 01:08:48.011
Oh, what have you
done to your face?

01:08:49.702 --> 01:08:50.908
Did you?

01:08:50.943 --> 01:08:52.495
No, it happened
before the journey.

01:08:54.116 --> 01:08:55.149
Oh, my heart.

01:08:56.461 --> 01:08:57.943
Here's me kicking up
a fuss in front of you

01:08:57.978 --> 01:09:00.149
and you probably even
remember who I am.

01:09:01.081 --> 01:09:02.461
I don't, I'm sorry.

01:09:02.495 --> 01:09:04.805
That's fine, I
wouldn't expect you to.

01:09:06.011 --> 01:09:08.840
It's very kind of you to
come at all considering.

01:09:08.874 --> 01:09:13.529
You know he wasn't
terrible, he really wasn't.

01:09:13.564 --> 01:09:14.978
He had lots of issues

01:09:15.011 --> 01:09:18.529
and well he certainly
had his demons.

01:09:18.564 --> 01:09:21.564
But he wasn't one himself.

01:09:23.564 --> 01:09:26.943
Sunny, darling, John's going
to come back with Helen now.

01:09:26.978 --> 01:09:29.770
So you can squeeze in with
us for our journey back.

01:09:29.805 --> 01:09:31.287
Ah.

01:09:31.323 --> 01:09:34.011
Alright well, I shall
see you in the car.

01:09:34.046 --> 01:09:34.874
Five minutes.

01:09:36.011 --> 01:09:37.185
Just be over there.

01:09:37.219 --> 01:09:38.219
Okay,

01:09:38.254 --> 01:09:39.081
Bye, Ryan.

01:09:40.046 --> 01:09:41.149
It was lovely to see you.

01:09:41.185 --> 01:09:42.011
And you.

01:09:58.702 --> 01:10:00.254
I don't understand.

01:10:00.288 --> 01:10:01.633
Huh?

01:10:01.667 --> 01:10:02.736
You don't know him.

01:10:02.771 --> 01:10:03.978
No, I don't.

01:10:04.012 --> 01:10:05.219
So why is my
mom talking to you

01:10:05.254 --> 01:10:06.425
like you care more
than what you do?

01:10:07.357 --> 01:10:08.529
I don't know,

01:10:08.564 --> 01:10:10.047
because he's my
biological father.

01:10:10.081 --> 01:10:11.874
Yeah I know that, but,

01:10:11.909 --> 01:10:12.840
of course he is,

01:10:12.874 --> 01:10:14.219
but I'm sorry, why are you here?

01:10:15.392 --> 01:10:16.736
He left when I was
really, really young.

01:10:16.771 --> 01:10:18.736
And I never had...

01:10:18.771 --> 01:10:20.460
Yeah, sorry, but

01:10:20.495 --> 01:10:22.805
why are you here and not
at home with your mum?

01:10:23.702 --> 01:10:25.185
I don't...

01:10:25.219 --> 01:10:26.081
It's just that you made
it seem like you didn't care

01:10:26.116 --> 01:10:27.771
so I just I don't understand.

01:10:29.392 --> 01:10:32.185
I don't care, he wasn't
a father to me then

01:10:32.219 --> 01:10:33.874
and I don't see him
as a father now.

01:10:33.909 --> 01:10:35.357
- No, I understand that.
- You know, Sunny,

01:10:35.391 --> 01:10:37.702
it's not something I
really want to talk about.

01:10:39.702 --> 01:10:41.495
Are you keeping
something from me?

01:10:42.943 --> 01:10:45.357
Are you protecting
me from something?

01:10:45.391 --> 01:10:47.288
Because I don't need protecting.

01:10:47.323 --> 01:10:48.460
Okay, I know you.

01:10:49.771 --> 01:10:51.425
Sunny, you've
only just met me.

01:10:52.323 --> 01:10:54.943
Don't patronize me, okay?

01:10:54.978 --> 01:10:56.943
Don't make me feel
like this whole

01:10:56.978 --> 01:10:58.771
journey is any less
than what it is,

01:10:58.805 --> 01:10:59.702
'cause I know what it is

01:10:59.736 --> 01:11:00.874
and I know what I feel.

01:11:00.909 --> 01:11:02.116
You know what, Sunny?

01:11:02.150 --> 01:11:03.425
Sunny, it's not
always about you.

01:11:04.529 --> 01:11:06.047
Okay, I know you're used
to all the attention

01:11:06.081 --> 01:11:07.564
but it's not always about you.

01:11:09.425 --> 01:11:10.771
Are you lying to me?

01:11:12.667 --> 01:11:14.909
I mean, do you actually
care about your dad

01:11:14.943 --> 01:11:18.702
or is everything you said
about your mom true as well?

01:11:18.736 --> 01:11:19.909
Is she really dying?

01:11:19.943 --> 01:11:21.254
Sunny.

01:11:21.288 --> 01:11:22.495
Because if she is and
she is at home right now

01:11:22.529 --> 01:11:24.598
and you are the only
person that she has,

01:11:24.633 --> 01:11:26.185
I mean what the fuck are you
doing at this man's funeral?

01:11:26.219 --> 01:11:29.150
I don't know, God,
I don't know Sunny.

01:11:29.185 --> 01:11:31.771
Please, please
stop, I don't know.

01:11:38.047 --> 01:11:40.219
I just wanted to get away.

01:11:42.012 --> 01:11:43.116
Yeah, but your mom.

01:11:45.633 --> 01:11:47.185
There has to be a better reason.

01:11:47.219 --> 01:11:49.840
I mean, she must really need
you and want you right now.

01:11:51.943 --> 01:11:53.460
Don't you think I know that?

01:11:55.805 --> 01:11:59.667
Jesus.

01:11:59.702 --> 01:12:00.598
You know I wake up

01:12:00.633 --> 01:12:02.874
and I look at her and I see her

01:12:02.909 --> 01:12:06.081
and I am forced to be reminded
that I'm gonna lose her.

01:12:08.667 --> 01:12:11.495
And God, I love her,
I love her so much.

01:12:15.978 --> 01:12:17.460
You know this one time,

01:12:17.495 --> 01:12:20.874
I won this shitty little award
at work and she was there,

01:12:20.909 --> 01:12:24.460
she came for it and I walked up

01:12:24.495 --> 01:12:26.391
and when I went to collect it,

01:12:26.425 --> 01:12:28.391
I saw her, she went to stand up

01:12:28.425 --> 01:12:32.322
and she couldn't, she just
feel straight back down.

01:12:36.287 --> 01:12:37.185
You know I wake up every morning

01:12:37.219 --> 01:12:38.805
and I slap a smile on my face

01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:42.012
and I care for her, the
best that I possibly can.

01:12:43.391 --> 01:12:46.909
And I stay positive, because
I know that if I don't,

01:12:49.943 --> 01:12:51.116
that it'll end her.

01:12:56.219 --> 01:12:58.081
I kinda feel so
selfish 'cause I know

01:12:58.116 --> 01:13:00.702
it's not my illness,
but I'm so tired.

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:06.356
God, I'm so tired.

01:13:09.702 --> 01:13:10.529
Get her.

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:19.598
No, no, dad, no!

01:13:19.633 --> 01:13:21.667
Get your fucking
hands off her!

01:13:21.702 --> 01:13:23.529
With me now.

01:13:23.564 --> 01:13:24.391
Don't touch me.
