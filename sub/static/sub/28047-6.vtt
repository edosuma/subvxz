WEBVTT

00:11.100 --> 00:13.050
I know someone
that witnessed the shooting.

00:13.070 --> 00:15.170
-Somebody who says it was G?
-It's a child.

00:16.230 --> 00:18.200
I'm taxin' the Ravens
for what we're losin'

00:18.220 --> 00:20.090
because that asshole arrested G.

00:22.060 --> 00:24.030
-Hey!
-Come on! Come on! Come on!

00:24.050 --> 00:26.170
If you had a witness,
I'd still be in jail.

00:26.190 --> 00:28.110
I just don't want to put this person
in your sights, man.

00:28.130 --> 00:30.090
Who is it?

00:30.110 --> 00:31.090
Move.

00:31.110 --> 00:32.220
I did not rape your mother.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
We slept together once.
Consensually.

00:35.020 --> 00:37.160
Wake the hell up,
or get out!

00:37.180 --> 00:39.070
'Cause I'm not the one who's lying.

00:39.090 --> 00:41.120
Dani told her friend
that men with guns

00:41.140 --> 00:43.200
broke into your house a few nights ago.

00:43.220 --> 00:45.230
I'm going to ask the Department
of Children's Services

00:46.010 --> 00:47.020
to do a home check.

00:47.040 --> 00:48.020
They trust you yet?

00:48.040 --> 00:49.140
They don't even trust each other.

00:49.160 --> 00:51.220
It's about time I meet
these people myself.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.190
Start layin' track for an intro.

00:53.210 --> 00:55.160
This relationship you got
with the cartel--

00:55.180 --> 00:56.210
it's gonna end badly.

00:56.230 --> 00:58.030
They're not gonna let us walk away.

00:58.050 --> 00:59.200
Then I need someone
I can trust runnin' it.

00:59.220 --> 01:01.080
I don't want to go to jail again.

01:01.100 --> 01:03.000
-Can I help you?
-DEA! Hands where I can see 'em!

01:03.020 --> 01:04.090
What the hell's goin' on?

01:04.110 --> 01:06.110
The DEA has their hands
on the cartel's throat,

01:06.130 --> 01:09.020
and it's just a matter of time before
our connection to them comes up.

01:09.040 --> 01:11.120
I'll find Price
and get the answers we need.

01:11.140 --> 01:12.230
She can't come to the phone right now.

01:13.010 --> 01:14.050
But maybe I can help.

01:14.070 --> 01:16.070
Your brother's
running his own program,

01:16.090 --> 01:18.000
and Price is gonna help him do it.

01:18.020 --> 01:19.120
You don't wanna hear
the truth, do you?

01:19.140 --> 01:21.040
That your son is a traitor.

01:21.060 --> 01:22.120
What are you gonna do about it?

01:22.140 --> 01:24.210
I will talk to him.
Face to face.

01:24.230 --> 01:26.020
That's a bad idea.

04:13.180 --> 04:15.120
What did he say?

04:16.210 --> 04:19.100
-He wants the Ravens to work for him.
-And?

04:19.120 --> 04:22.010
Listen, I said what I needed to
to get out of that room.

04:23.100 --> 04:25.130
That doesn't mean
I'm gonna do it.

04:25.150 --> 04:28.000
So, you're gonna say no?

04:29.220 --> 04:31.050
Yes.

04:31.070 --> 04:32.160
Good.

04:33.180 --> 04:34.220
I'm glad to hear that,

04:35.000 --> 04:39.060
because there are a lot of people
that are still loyal to my family

04:39.080 --> 04:41.050
that want to see my father
back in power.

04:51.040 --> 04:53.150
- What the hell's goin' on?
- You OK?

04:53.170 --> 04:54.230
Where's Cole?

04:55.010 --> 04:57.000
Texted him to meet us,
but he never showed.

04:57.020 --> 05:00.210
Ricardo's taken over the cartel.
Killed anyone loyal to Ignacio.

05:03.160 --> 05:05.170
-What about Carmen?
-She's saying what she has to

05:05.190 --> 05:08.110
so that he doesn't lock her up
like her father.

05:08.130 --> 05:10.010
And he tried to kill Price.

05:10.030 --> 05:11.160
But she got away.

05:11.180 --> 05:12.190
Shit.

05:12.210 --> 05:14.150
Why'd he have Hector
take you to him?

05:14.170 --> 05:17.210
He wants us to organize
the other cop gangs.

05:17.230 --> 05:20.110
Get them all working
strictly for him.

05:20.130 --> 05:23.060
-Not happening.
-But you told him no, right?

05:23.080 --> 05:25.210
Just like Carmen,
I told him what he wanted to hear.

05:25.230 --> 05:27.220
But as far as we're concerned,
it's a no.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.190
How do we distance ourselves from this
without it going south?

05:30.210 --> 05:33.120
We back Carmen.

05:33.140 --> 05:36.030
Are you fucking kidding me?

05:38.060 --> 05:40.120
It's the lesser of two evils.

05:46.110 --> 05:50.130
This isn't about Barry
or that man. This is about you.

05:50.150 --> 05:52.020
You said we should always
tell the truth.

05:53.030 --> 05:57.010
I did. And I would never
ask you to lie.

05:57.030 --> 05:59.040
We just want you

05:59.060 --> 06:00.180
to not talk about this.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.020
To anyone.

06:04.150 --> 06:06.080
He killed Barry.

06:06.100 --> 06:08.160
And God will judge him for that.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.000
Just promise us. Please.

06:16.200 --> 06:19.110
You know what,
Barry wouldn't want you in danger.

06:19.130 --> 06:23.100
And that's what will happen
if people know that you saw the shooting.

06:23.120 --> 06:27.030
You said tellin' the truth
builds trust in an untruthful world.

06:29.180 --> 06:31.180
I say a lot of things.

06:31.200 --> 06:33.210
But I'm just a man, son.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.080
I'm not always right.

06:39.200 --> 06:41.180
You was about that.

07:19.190 --> 07:21.090
Dani, are you OK?

07:21.110 --> 07:22.190
Isabel Williams.

07:22.210 --> 07:25.050
I'm with the Department
of Child Services.

07:25.070 --> 07:27.140
I'm taking Dani into state protection.

07:27.160 --> 07:28.210
The hell you are.

07:29.210 --> 07:31.110
Here's the court order.

07:46.010 --> 07:47.150
So you go to college?

07:48.200 --> 07:50.110
Are you kidding me?

07:50.130 --> 07:52.110
Maybe I would have
if you'd been around to pay for it.

08:03.030 --> 08:04.110
Must be nice

08:04.130 --> 08:07.220
having all these young women
constantly throwing themselves at you.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.010
Not really.

08:09.030 --> 08:11.070
You learn to set up
some pretty firm boundaries.

08:11.090 --> 08:12.150
How do you mean?

08:12.170 --> 08:15.000
I teach in a class with
more than 80% women.

08:15.020 --> 08:17.020
Many of them would be
more than happy to...

08:17.040 --> 08:20.140
threaten or flirt their ways
to a passing grade.

08:20.160 --> 08:22.140
Don't try and tell me
you don't date.

08:22.160 --> 08:25.000
You're in your fifties,
you're not dead.

08:25.020 --> 08:26.060
Yeah, I'm careful.

08:26.080 --> 08:28.050
Bad relationship
could end my career.

08:30.030 --> 08:32.170
It's why I keep my office hours
in a public area.

08:35.090 --> 08:36.100
Hey.

08:36.120 --> 08:37.140
Excuse me a minute.

08:49.040 --> 08:51.230
Are--Are you here officially?

08:52.010 --> 08:53.170
What do you mean?

08:53.190 --> 08:56.080
With Mr. Everett.
About the accusations?

08:58.000 --> 08:59.200
What accusations?

09:04.150 --> 09:06.050
Sorry to bother you.

09:33.070 --> 09:34.120
Officer Hammond.

09:35.100 --> 09:36.170
Can we speak?

09:39.000 --> 09:40.090
About what?

09:40.110 --> 09:42.150
I'm looking for Aria Price.

09:42.170 --> 09:44.130
Any idea where she's at?

09:49.110 --> 09:51.160
Ignacio Velasquez.

09:51.180 --> 09:54.230
Freed during transport
by a heavily armed, well informed group.

09:55.010 --> 09:59.200
There's also security contracts
that tie you to Carmen Velasquez.

09:59.220 --> 10:01.200
What does one thing
have to do with the other?

10:01.220 --> 10:03.190
Everything. I'm gonna
let you in on something

10:03.210 --> 10:06.060
so we can both stop
wasting each other's time.

10:06.080 --> 10:08.150
Aria Price is out
because I let her out,

10:08.170 --> 10:11.170
and I did so not because
of information she gave me,

10:11.190 --> 10:14.150
but information that
she would be gathering for me.

10:14.170 --> 10:16.190
So she was an informant?

10:18.180 --> 10:20.030
"Was"?

10:22.040 --> 10:23.180
Is she dead?

10:25.120 --> 10:28.040
If you got a case, arrest me.

10:28.060 --> 10:30.060
If not, piss off!

10:30.080 --> 10:33.190
I have everything I need to indict you
and the rest of the Ravens

10:33.210 --> 10:35.190
for what you did with Ignacio.

10:42.070 --> 10:44.140
But it's the cartel I want.

10:46.010 --> 10:49.130
So what I'm doing here...
is giving you a choice.

10:49.150 --> 10:52.110
What's the ask? Exactly.

10:52.130 --> 10:55.000
Price is either dead or on the run.

10:55.020 --> 10:57.120
Either way, I need a new informant.

10:57.140 --> 11:00.010
One that's already inside and trusted.

11:00.030 --> 11:02.030
Ignacio isn't running things anymore.

11:02.050 --> 11:03.150
Ricardo is.

11:03.170 --> 11:06.170
Good. He's impulsive.

11:06.190 --> 11:09.040
Makes him easy to manipulate.

11:11.020 --> 11:13.090
Are you in? Or out?

11:14.230 --> 11:18.200
This decision isn't just mine to make.
I need to run it by my guys.

11:18.220 --> 11:21.150
No, this deal is for your ears only.

11:23.170 --> 11:25.040
And it's not a free ride.

11:25.060 --> 11:27.220
There are consequences to actions.

11:28.000 --> 11:32.100
Once we take the cartel down,
you go to jail as well.

11:32.120 --> 11:34.050
Then why would I do it?

11:34.070 --> 11:37.110
Because for every cartel member
you testify against,

11:37.130 --> 11:39.060
your sentence gets reduced.

11:39.080 --> 11:42.130
-Not interested.
-You'll be the only Raven to testify

11:42.150 --> 11:45.040
and the only Raven we'll prosecute.

11:46.220 --> 11:48.160
So you'll keep all my guys out of it?

11:48.180 --> 11:51.060
As long as you do what's needed.

11:52.100 --> 11:54.160
I've been lied to before,
so I want it in writing.

11:54.180 --> 11:56.070
That's not a problem.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.040
We need to get Ignacio back in custody.

12:01.060 --> 12:04.060
And you need to find out
where he's at, and tell me.

12:05.070 --> 12:08.220
He's being held by Ricardo's men.
I don't know where.

12:09.000 --> 12:10.190
Then find out through Carmen.

12:10.210 --> 12:13.100
And put a target on my back?

12:13.120 --> 12:15.210
She's gonna know
I was the one who gave him up.

12:15.230 --> 12:18.030
You broke him out.

12:18.050 --> 12:21.000
It's only fair that you help
get him back.

12:42.100 --> 12:45.190
- Where are you, Cole?
- Cole's tied up right now.

12:53.050 --> 12:55.210
Where is he?
The fuck's my brother?

12:55.230 --> 12:57.070
He's safe, for now.

12:59.070 --> 13:02.140
You remember what happened when
Neckbone fucked with my family, right?

13:02.160 --> 13:06.030
This is happenin' because
your brother crossed the line.

13:06.050 --> 13:07.220
And I ain't Neckbone.

13:11.190 --> 13:13.120
He's still alive.

13:13.140 --> 13:15.200
And he'll stay that way, as long as
I get what I want,

13:17.230 --> 13:19.050
What is it you want?

13:19.070 --> 13:22.080
I'm hearing there's a witness
to some work I put in.

13:22.100 --> 13:24.190
But your brother won't tell me
who it is.

13:24.210 --> 13:27.150
So before I go to an ignorant place
and beat it out of him,

13:27.170 --> 13:29.120
I figured I'd ask you.

13:32.070 --> 13:33.190
Take me to him.

13:34.100 --> 13:36.110
Take me to him
and I'll get you the answer you need.

13:36.130 --> 13:38.060
No, you won't.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.070
You'll just try something stupid.

13:42.150 --> 13:44.200
You touch him...

13:44.220 --> 13:46.090
we're goin' to war.

13:47.080 --> 13:49.220
So think real hard
about your next move, huh?

13:50.160 --> 13:53.050
You got 24 hours.

13:53.070 --> 13:56.040
If I don't have a witness by then,

13:56.060 --> 13:58.190
then  I'll  do something stupid.

13:58.210 --> 14:00.000
You feel me?

14:00.020 --> 14:01.200
You already have.

14:04.170 --> 14:06.020
Clock's ticking.

14:08.130 --> 14:12.070
We're not really gonna give up a witness
to that asshole, are we?

14:12.090 --> 14:13.200
No.

14:20.130 --> 14:23.230
I need you two to start sniffin' around
G's territory.

14:24.010 --> 14:26.160
See if we can't get a lead
on where they're keepin' him.

14:26.180 --> 14:28.080
But we better keep it low-key,

14:28.100 --> 14:31.040
'cause G hears we're doin' it,
he'll kill Cole.

14:48.060 --> 14:49.140
Steve.

14:53.030 --> 14:55.150
Cole's not the only problem.
I can see it on your face.

14:57.100 --> 14:59.030
There something else going on?

15:03.150 --> 15:04.190
Yeah.

15:06.150 --> 15:09.010
We're a family.
We handle this shit together.

15:10.140 --> 15:12.140
So tell me. What's up?

15:13.110 --> 15:16.100
You trust me, Karen?

15:16.120 --> 15:18.170
Of course I do.

15:18.190 --> 15:20.200
Then stay out of it.

15:21.200 --> 15:22.220
Please.

15:39.140 --> 15:42.000
-Hey, you got a sec?
-Now's not a good time.

15:42.020 --> 15:44.090
DCS took Dani away from me.

15:46.220 --> 15:48.020
What?

15:51.090 --> 15:52.200
Shit!

15:52.220 --> 15:55.010
-Yeah.
-I'm sorry, Chris.

15:57.010 --> 15:58.190
I don't know what to do.

15:59.170 --> 16:01.160
Listen, you're not alone, all right?

16:01.180 --> 16:04.220
There's a lot of shit goin' on right now,
but we got your back.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.020
I promise, we'll get your sister back.

16:07.040 --> 16:08.060
You hear me?

16:09.180 --> 16:10.230
Yeah.

16:12.070 --> 16:13.140
Yeah, thanks.

16:21.020 --> 16:22.140
Why the sudden interest?

16:22.160 --> 16:25.080
If there was a witness to a murder,
I need to know about it.

16:25.100 --> 16:27.030
Where's Cole?

16:27.050 --> 16:28.220
He's tied up on somethin'. Why?

16:29.000 --> 16:30.210
I already told him about this,

16:30.230 --> 16:33.170
and he agreed it's better
the kid doesn't come forward.

16:33.190 --> 16:34.200
The kid?

16:41.130 --> 16:44.010
Don't do this.
Please.

16:45.170 --> 16:48.030
I'll find another way
to keep G off the streets.

16:51.140 --> 16:53.150
And tell your friends, too.

16:53.170 --> 16:56.000
No more comin' here,
askin' questions.

16:57.030 --> 16:58.150
Friends?

16:58.170 --> 17:00.150
The other cops.

17:00.170 --> 17:02.230
They were here this morning.

17:03.010 --> 17:04.200
Asking about the witness, as well.

17:04.220 --> 17:06.090
They have a name?

17:06.110 --> 17:09.060
I'm pretty sure one of the name tags
said Jones.

18:16.020 --> 18:19.000
You leave a message
saying it's important I call,

18:19.020 --> 18:21.060
and then when I do,
you ignore me.

18:21.080 --> 18:23.120
There's a lot goin' on right now.

18:23.140 --> 18:25.150
No kidding. You look like shit.

18:27.100 --> 18:29.100
So why don't you tell me
what's up?

18:31.170 --> 18:34.070
I need you to shut down
the security business.

18:34.090 --> 18:37.070
Leave a letter of resignation on the desk
where someone can find it,

18:37.090 --> 18:39.170
and just walk away.

18:39.190 --> 18:42.020
-Is it that bad?
-Yes, that bad.

18:45.010 --> 18:46.190
And you need to distance yourself,
brother.

18:46.210 --> 18:48.080
Talk to me. Talk to me. C'mon.

18:51.100 --> 18:52.130
You were right.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.190
So just fuckin' do it.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.100
No.

20:13.030 --> 20:15.110
The Vipers are puttin' in work for G.

20:15.130 --> 20:17.110
And the witness he's lookin'
to wet down is a kid.

20:17.130 --> 20:19.150
So giving him up is a non-starter.

20:19.170 --> 20:22.060
Yeah. We need another way
to get Cole back.

20:22.080 --> 20:25.030
If the Vipers are workin'
that closely with G,

20:25.050 --> 20:27.030
they gotta know where Cole is.

20:27.050 --> 20:29.020
So how do we get them to tell us?

20:29.040 --> 20:30.150
We ask an ugly way.

20:30.170 --> 20:33.220
They're still not gonna say shit.
I know those guys.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.200
Then maybe we point out

20:35.220 --> 20:38.050
there's a shitload more money to be made
workin' for the cartel.

20:48.090 --> 20:49.090
Hey.

20:52.210 --> 20:54.010
Got answers for me?

20:54.030 --> 20:56.000
If you want the cop gangs
in your back pocket,

20:56.020 --> 20:57.120
they'll need cash up front.

20:58.140 --> 20:59.210
Money motivates.

20:59.230 --> 21:02.200
No, no. We pay for services rendered.

21:02.220 --> 21:05.070
We don't do retainers.

21:05.090 --> 21:08.190
Ricardo, the only way the other cop gangs
are gonna take this arrangement seriously

21:08.210 --> 21:11.030
is if you outpay the competition.

21:14.140 --> 21:16.220
-How much are we talking about?
-Two hundred thousand.

21:18.160 --> 21:21.000
And even then,
there are gonna be holdouts.

21:21.020 --> 21:23.100
But a majority will agree.

21:43.140 --> 21:46.110
Comin' over to our side?
Where the real men are?

21:47.160 --> 21:49.030
Where's Cole?

21:49.050 --> 21:51.050
I don't know what you're talking about.

21:52.220 --> 21:56.060
-Anybody?
-Snatching a cop is crossing the line.

21:56.080 --> 21:58.050
What do you think's gonna happen
if G kills him?

21:58.070 --> 21:59.100
He'll be dead.

22:00.190 --> 22:02.140
Like them.

22:03.220 --> 22:06.020
These three.

22:06.040 --> 22:07.190
They died in the line.

22:07.210 --> 22:11.150
McNabb here ate his gun after he retired
and his old lady left him.

22:14.090 --> 22:16.040
This guy.

22:16.060 --> 22:18.210
You guys remember this loser?

22:18.230 --> 22:21.000
Yeah, this is a dumb ass
who's stupid enough

22:21.020 --> 22:23.110
to think he could rob
the Colombian cartel.

22:26.010 --> 22:28.090
That's not on us, though.

22:28.110 --> 22:31.160
Towards the end,
that sellout was more Raven than Viper.

22:36.110 --> 22:39.040
I know you all feel his pain,
but you need to sit down.

22:40.070 --> 22:43.140
You ain't gonna shoot a cop.

22:44.160 --> 22:46.000
You ain't a cop to me.

22:52.160 --> 22:54.200
Take a seat, assholes.

23:01.190 --> 23:05.060
Whatever G's payin' you, we'll make sure
the cartel doubles it.

23:05.080 --> 23:07.020
Just tell us where he's at.

23:08.190 --> 23:10.070
We're not interested.

23:10.090 --> 23:12.040
He speak for all of you?

23:12.060 --> 23:14.140
What, money ain't important?

23:14.160 --> 23:17.230
If it involves you assholes,
no amount of money brings us to the table.

23:18.010 --> 23:19.200
Stop being a dick. Where's Cole?

23:22.130 --> 23:24.050
Go fuck yourself.

23:54.080 --> 23:57.010
You two post up on Jones,
we'll take G.

23:57.030 --> 23:59.110
See if that visit
creates any movement.

24:11.020 --> 24:12.230
Holy shit.

24:13.010 --> 24:14.150
Never know what you're gonna need.

24:14.170 --> 24:16.160
That stuff isn't department issue.

24:18.090 --> 24:19.140
Let's go.

25:05.130 --> 25:07.210
So why we back in bed
with the cartel?

25:09.100 --> 25:11.090
Thought you didn't
want to hear about it.

25:14.190 --> 25:17.170
Same reason we do anything.
We're on a money chase.

25:30.160 --> 25:33.050
You see that look in Karen's eyes
when she came at Jones?

25:35.000 --> 25:36.110
Yeah.

25:38.010 --> 25:40.090
She don't do grief like normal people.

25:41.220 --> 25:43.190
Never understood her and Foster.

25:44.230 --> 25:46.180
I don't think she did, either.

25:50.020 --> 25:52.180
What  does  she do
like normal people?

26:01.090 --> 26:03.050
That's what I'm telling you.

26:03.070 --> 26:06.180
You don't play by the rules.
You make them play by yours.

26:06.200 --> 26:08.050
If it was me--

26:08.070 --> 26:10.130
It's not you. It's me.

26:10.150 --> 26:13.090
When it comes to my sister,
I'm not takin' chances.

26:13.110 --> 26:16.000
You want her back,
you do whatever it takes.

26:20.160 --> 26:23.010
Put this under the tire well
of Jones's car.

26:23.030 --> 26:25.130
It's that ugly-ass Camaro over there.

26:25.150 --> 26:27.010
Hey, listen.

26:28.040 --> 26:29.220
Take your time, do it right,

26:30.000 --> 26:31.130
and don't be seen.

26:31.150 --> 26:32.170
Got it.

26:46.080 --> 26:48.000
- Yeah?
- Can you talk?

26:49.130 --> 26:51.130
Yeah. About what?

26:54.020 --> 26:56.110
I want you to tell me
exactly what he did to you.

27:04.070 --> 27:05.140
Why?

27:33.000 --> 27:34.060
OK, I will.

27:34.080 --> 27:35.200
And Mom...

27:37.160 --> 27:38.190
thank you.

27:45.100 --> 27:46.200
You OK?

27:49.080 --> 27:50.130
Yeah.

28:05.080 --> 28:07.180
Ohh-- Oh, fuck!

28:26.040 --> 28:28.030
Help! Help!

28:30.000 --> 28:31.160
Son of a bitch hit an alarm,

28:31.180 --> 28:34.170
- we need to move him!
-I'll be there in five.

28:36.110 --> 28:38.120
Let Steve know
Jones is on the move.

28:54.010 --> 28:55.030
Jones is mobile.

28:55.050 --> 28:56.160
Jones.

28:56.180 --> 28:58.120
What's your 20 and direction of travel?

28:58.140 --> 29:01.010
East on 7th Street,
crossing Cloverfield.

29:05.040 --> 29:06.140
Move him, let's go.

29:09.200 --> 29:10.220
Get him in the trunk.

29:19.180 --> 29:21.130
Don't even think about it!

29:26.030 --> 29:27.050
Back up.

29:29.140 --> 29:31.000
Move away, Jones.

29:31.020 --> 29:32.050
Move away.

29:32.070 --> 29:33.230
Back up!

29:34.010 --> 29:36.030
Easy, bitch. Easy.

29:36.050 --> 29:38.080
Back up.
Got him, Ramos?

29:38.100 --> 29:39.150
Yeah.

29:47.200 --> 29:49.140
Yo, back it up, back up!

29:58.010 --> 29:59.070
He's in.

30:06.210 --> 30:08.050
Get G on the cell.

30:08.070 --> 30:09.110
Tell him we lost Cole.

30:16.020 --> 30:17.120
Uh, thank you.

30:24.010 --> 30:26.020
Sit down, old man.

30:27.010 --> 30:28.200
And you too, lady.

30:36.130 --> 30:38.170
Now, you know why I'm here.

30:38.190 --> 30:41.150
Just give me a name, and...

30:41.170 --> 30:43.150
we're out of your lives.

30:43.170 --> 30:46.120
Son, I have no idea
what you're talkin' about.

30:47.180 --> 30:49.150
-Aah!
-Don't you touch him!

30:49.170 --> 30:51.140
We don't know what you're talking about!

30:53.010 --> 30:55.120
Yeah...you do.

30:58.200 --> 31:02.010
I'm gonna give you five chances,
and then it's over.

31:02.230 --> 31:04.230
Arm, arm.

31:05.010 --> 31:06.230
Leg, leg.

31:07.010 --> 31:08.150
And head.

31:11.180 --> 31:13.010
Get off me!

31:13.030 --> 31:16.120
I need to ask the same question.

31:16.140 --> 31:17.190
He doesn't--

31:17.210 --> 31:19.160
He doesn't know!

31:22.020 --> 31:23.120
Is that right?

31:25.220 --> 31:27.040
Do  you  know?

31:28.190 --> 31:30.010
Same game.

31:30.030 --> 31:32.000
Different target.

31:32.020 --> 31:34.040
-Aaah!
-Stop it!

31:34.060 --> 31:36.130
- Stop it!
- Oh, I will.

31:36.150 --> 31:38.180
When you give me an answer!

31:41.200 --> 31:45.100
It's me! I me,  I'm  the witness!

32:16.050 --> 32:18.190
- He's a cop.
- Come on, man, move!

32:55.030 --> 32:57.120
Oh, man...

33:12.120 --> 33:14.160
This is only temporary.

33:14.180 --> 33:16.130
For how long?

33:19.090 --> 33:20.230
I don't know.

33:21.190 --> 33:23.150
Not forever.

33:23.170 --> 33:25.170
I'm gonna get you back.

33:25.190 --> 33:28.050
I don't wanna stay here.
I wanna go with you.

33:31.230 --> 33:34.040
They won't listen to me here.

33:34.230 --> 33:36.080
I know.

33:37.100 --> 33:40.000
I'm gonna bring you back home.
I promise.

33:41.100 --> 33:42.170
OK?

33:42.190 --> 33:44.090
Yeah.

33:44.110 --> 33:46.100
Just gotta try and be strong.

34:10.210 --> 34:12.090
Cole.

34:17.010 --> 34:19.000
Want me to come in?

35:44.010 --> 35:46.040
I know it's late. I'm sorry.

35:49.060 --> 35:50.130
Drink?

35:54.180 --> 35:56.180
This isn't a social call.

35:56.200 --> 35:58.120
Let's make it one.

36:11.010 --> 36:12.070
If you want to talk business,

36:12.090 --> 36:14.140
you probably should be
talking to my brother.

36:14.160 --> 36:15.220
Right?

36:18.100 --> 36:21.090
If I'm doin' business with your family,
I'd rather it be with you.

36:21.110 --> 36:23.140
That's not your decision to make.

36:25.100 --> 36:27.170
Do you know where
Ignacio is being held?

36:29.040 --> 36:33.130
-Why?
-If I can free your father...

36:33.150 --> 36:35.100
what's in it for me?

36:38.140 --> 36:39.220
Depends.

36:40.170 --> 36:42.080
What are you after?

37:16.200 --> 37:18.060
Qué?

37:20.020 --> 37:22.050
- Qué paso?
- We need to talk now.

37:22.070 --> 37:25.080
OK. I'll see you here in an hour.

37:40.010 --> 37:41.130
Hey.

37:42.100 --> 37:45.040
-Thanks for meeting me.
-You said it was important.

37:45.060 --> 37:47.190
Yeah. I need to ask you something.

37:48.150 --> 37:50.050
About?

37:51.100 --> 37:53.180
How long have you been teaching
at the university?

37:53.200 --> 37:56.210
This one... seven years.

37:58.060 --> 37:59.080
And before that?

38:01.180 --> 38:02.200
Why?

38:11.110 --> 38:13.130
These are complaints...

38:13.150 --> 38:15.200
filed by female students
and faculty members

38:15.220 --> 38:18.080
from the last three places
that you've worked.

38:21.050 --> 38:22.140
They're all the same.

38:24.180 --> 38:27.060
But you kept your job
because there's nothing in here

38:27.080 --> 38:29.150
that you couldn't dismiss
as a misunderstanding.

38:31.010 --> 38:32.170
-Or consensual.
-This is--

38:32.190 --> 38:34.050
I don't want to hear
your side of the story.

38:34.070 --> 38:36.030
-I want to hear theirs.
-There's nothing here--

38:36.050 --> 38:39.180
My mother told me
exactly what you did to her.

38:42.230 --> 38:46.050
It's hard to believe I came from
your pathetic set of balls.

38:46.070 --> 38:48.090
Now, when I let go,

38:48.110 --> 38:52.050
you'll suffer for a little bit,
but the pain will fade.

38:53.060 --> 38:56.080
-Ow!
-What you do to these women...

38:56.100 --> 38:59.010
-never leaves them.
-All right! All right!

38:59.030 --> 39:00.160
Aaah!

39:00.180 --> 39:02.070
All right, what?

39:02.090 --> 39:04.110
-She might have felt that--
-Don't go there.

39:04.130 --> 39:05.200
Say the word.

39:05.220 --> 39:08.090
Say "I raped her."

39:08.110 --> 39:10.060
I raped her. I raped her!

39:21.200 --> 39:24.100
From now on,
you keep it in your pants.

39:26.060 --> 39:28.100
Because if you don't,

39:28.120 --> 39:30.210
I'm gonna come back here
and rip that fucker off.

40:36.050 --> 40:38.160
Go! Go! Go!

40:59.090 --> 41:01.080
Habla.

41:46.100 --> 41:49.090
We have the package.
Heading back to home base.

41:50.210 --> 41:52.100
So now what?

41:53.150 --> 41:55.110
We focus on Ricardo.
