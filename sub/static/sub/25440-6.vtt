00:44.316 --> 00:46.385
I am so excited

00:46.462 --> 00:48.102
to see what you have
planned for our date.

00:48.179 --> 00:50.016
Don't you worry,
your royal blondeness.

00:50.093 --> 00:51.791
Eugene's got it covered.

00:51.868 --> 00:54.578
I've entrusted Max here
to seek out and deliver us

00:54.655 --> 00:57.107
to the most primo
romantic spot around.

00:57.184 --> 00:58.256
You'll see.

00:58.324 --> 00:59.545
We're talking dinner for two,

00:59.613 --> 01:01.525
the stars twinkling above,

01:01.602 --> 01:02.853
the works.

01:02.970 --> 01:04.658
Now, I'm not saying
it'll top our

01:04.735 --> 01:06.930
crown-stealing,
lantern-watching first date,

01:07.007 --> 01:08.706
but... I kinda am.

01:08.783 --> 01:10.306
Isn't that right, buddy?

01:11.829 --> 01:13.021
An apple tree?

01:13.089 --> 01:14.108
Seriously?

01:14.176 --> 01:15.347
That's the best you got?

01:15.424 --> 01:17.580
Should've asked
the frog to come along.

01:17.649 --> 01:19.275
Even he'd come up with
something better than this.

01:19.342 --> 01:21.572
It's okay, Eugene.

01:22.306 --> 01:23.572
Planning a date is hard

01:23.649 --> 01:25.227
when you're
in the middle of nowhere.

01:25.304 --> 01:27.678
We can just play it by ear.

01:27.915 --> 01:30.038
Well, anything is better
than the horse plan.

01:32.984 --> 01:34.190
Did you hear that?

01:34.267 --> 01:35.461
You mean those out of place,

01:35.538 --> 01:37.461
mystical chimes in
the middle of the forest?

01:37.538 --> 01:38.735
Yeah.

"See-er and know-er of all."

01:53.757 --> 01:56.479
Wow. A real psychic!

01:56.556 --> 01:58.698
Excuse me?
A real psychic?

01:58.775 --> 02:00.601
Oh no, no, no.

02:00.678 --> 02:02.362
- There's no such...
- Ahem!

02:02.439 --> 02:03.753
Gah! Holy quiet shoes!

02:03.830 --> 02:06.189
Greetings, travelers.

02:06.282 --> 02:10.021
My name is Madame Canardist.

02:10.520 --> 02:12.703
And inside this wagon is

02:12.780 --> 02:15.783
the world famous clairvoyant,

02:15.860 --> 02:19.627
Vigor the Visionary!

02:19.704 --> 02:22.383
He has predicted
the fates of emperors,

02:22.460 --> 02:24.258
the future of pharaohs,

02:24.335 --> 02:27.469
the destinies of dynasties even!

02:27.546 --> 02:29.664
And he is offering

02:29.741 --> 02:32.931
a once-in-a-lifetime special...

02:33.017 --> 02:34.900
One fortune

02:34.986 --> 02:38.869
for a mere five silver pieces.

02:38.946 --> 02:40.963
Eugene, did you hear that?

02:41.196 --> 02:42.851
Emperors and pharaohs!?

02:44.037 --> 02:45.119
Okay! Well, uh,

02:45.196 --> 02:46.785
add princess to that list.

02:46.862 --> 02:48.237
Uh, Blondie,

02:48.314 --> 02:50.188
you don't actually believe in

02:50.265 --> 02:52.229
this psychic business, do you?

02:52.408 --> 02:54.555
Well, I don't know if it's real,

02:54.632 --> 02:56.080
but what if it is?

02:56.157 --> 02:58.397
It's kinda fun to believe
in stuff like this.

03:01.839 --> 03:03.133
Silver.

03:03.210 --> 03:06.055
His omniscience requires

03:06.132 --> 03:09.314
five pieces of silver.

03:14.353 --> 03:16.885
Prepare to be astonished.

03:16.962 --> 03:18.549
He's telekinetic,

03:18.626 --> 03:20.291
he's telepathic,

03:20.368 --> 03:23.711
and he'll...
tele-you-the-future!

03:23.788 --> 03:25.330
Oh, man...

03:25.407 --> 03:26.596
Oof!

03:26.673 --> 03:27.796
Please welcome

03:27.873 --> 03:31.813
the world's most prophetic
prognosticator...

03:31.890 --> 03:36.189
Vigor the Visionary!

03:46.842 --> 03:47.968
Aw!

03:48.045 --> 03:49.296
He's a monkey.

03:49.373 --> 03:51.279
And he's adorable!

03:51.356 --> 03:52.567
Vigor...

03:52.644 --> 03:54.927
These people have come in search

03:55.004 --> 03:57.271
of your infinite guidance.

03:57.348 --> 03:59.167
If you are willing,

03:59.244 --> 04:00.958
blink twice.

04:04.401 --> 04:05.529
Did you see that?

04:05.605 --> 04:06.669
Please!

04:06.737 --> 04:09.279
Vigor requires total silence

04:09.356 --> 04:13.610
as he contacts the regions beyond.

04:28.859 --> 04:30.591
Uh huh. Got it.

04:30.668 --> 04:35.125
Vigor the Visionary
has spoken!

04:35.554 --> 04:38.820
"If you see someone fall,
pick them up."

04:38.897 --> 04:40.725
Are you serious, monkey?

04:43.343 --> 04:46.289
That is the most generic
fortune I have ever heard.

04:46.366 --> 04:48.357
Technically, it's not even a fortune.

04:48.434 --> 04:51.125
It's more like advice.
Or a motto. Or an edict.

04:51.202 --> 04:53.750
Okay! Thanks
for the fortune, Vigor.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.789
Oo, oo, oo! Or a credo!

04:55.866 --> 04:57.764
Stop me when you finally understand

04:57.841 --> 04:59.459
what I'm trying to tell you!

04:59.536 --> 05:02.617
"If you see someone
fall, pick them up..."

05:02.694 --> 05:04.043
What do you think it means?

05:04.120 --> 05:06.443
Oh, I know what it means.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.586
It means we just paid five silver pieces

05:08.663 --> 05:11.241
for a pilfering primate
to hand you a phony fortune.

05:11.318 --> 05:12.329
Well, so what?

05:12.406 --> 05:13.866
Maybe it was all just a trick,

05:13.943 --> 05:15.842
but what if, what if,

05:15.919 --> 05:17.267
it wasn't?

05:17.597 --> 05:20.159
And, I'm surprised at you, Eugene.

05:20.236 --> 05:22.752
We have seen some really
strange things together.

05:22.829 --> 05:24.620
Why are you being so cynical?

05:24.697 --> 05:26.622
Cynical? Cynical?

05:26.699 --> 05:28.118
Look, Blondie,

05:28.195 --> 05:30.144
I believe in some crazy stuff.

05:30.221 --> 05:31.603
You know that I do, right?

05:31.680 --> 05:33.225
Life-saving hair?
Believe it.

05:33.302 --> 05:34.698
Magical rocks?
Sure!

05:34.775 --> 05:36.750
Sword-fighting horses?
Why not?

05:36.836 --> 05:38.908
<i>Hermano caballo</i>, you sign me up.

05:38.976 --> 05:41.511
But if there's one thing
I do not believe in,

05:41.588 --> 05:44.574
it's fortune tellers. And if there's
a second thing I do not believe in,

05:44.651 --> 05:46.821
it's fortune tellers that
also happen to be monkeys.

05:46.898 --> 05:48.037
They're all sleazy,

05:48.114 --> 05:50.380
underhanded, fly-by-night,
dubious hucksters,

05:50.457 --> 05:52.829
and you know what?
I'm gonna prove it. Max?

05:52.906 --> 05:53.950
Back to the wagon.

06:08.859 --> 06:10.682
Madame Canardist?

06:11.218 --> 06:12.876
Are you okay?

06:12.953 --> 06:15.516
I never okay again!

06:15.593 --> 06:18.791
My Vigor has been taken.

06:18.923 --> 06:22.980
Thieves snatched him
right out of his wagon!

06:24.345 --> 06:26.409
It's gonna be alright. Don't worry.

06:26.486 --> 06:29.209
Eugene and I will find
the thieves that took Vigor,

06:29.286 --> 06:30.738
and we will bring him back.

06:30.815 --> 06:32.634
What?
Oh, no, no, no. Come on!

06:32.711 --> 06:33.957
The last thing I wanna do

06:34.034 --> 06:36.373
is spend the one night
we have to ourselves,

06:36.450 --> 06:39.073
chasing some monkey...

06:40.100 --> 06:41.545
Okay, we'll track down the monkey.

06:41.622 --> 06:43.114
I knew you would come around.

06:43.191 --> 06:44.368
I wouldn't go that far,

06:44.445 --> 06:46.936
but I have a pretty good idea
of who took him...

06:51.679 --> 06:53.162
Lift it higher!

06:53.239 --> 06:54.261
If he gets this one,

06:54.338 --> 06:56.111
we're all out of bananas!

06:59.265 --> 07:00.457
Eugene!

07:00.542 --> 07:01.865
Princess Rapunzel!

07:01.942 --> 07:03.282
Uh, hi!

07:03.359 --> 07:05.882
Alright, Angry. Gimme the monkey.

07:08.578 --> 07:10.315
What monkey?

07:10.882 --> 07:12.612
Angry? Red?

07:12.689 --> 07:14.789
Oh! We've missed you!

07:14.866 --> 07:16.651
We missed you, too!

07:16.728 --> 07:17.827
Especially Red.

07:17.904 --> 07:19.502
She won't shut up about you.

07:19.579 --> 07:22.987
You are so sweet!

07:23.959 --> 07:25.184
Oh! Um...

07:25.355 --> 07:28.758
yeah, and so, so in trouble.

07:28.986 --> 07:30.451
Now, I thought the two of you

07:30.528 --> 07:32.069
saw the error of your ways.

07:32.146 --> 07:33.469
And if you're going to steal,

07:33.546 --> 07:34.651
why steal this monkey?

07:35.915 --> 07:37.221
And while I'm thinking about it,

07:37.298 --> 07:38.658
how could you leave
my comb behind?

07:38.728 --> 07:39.933
It's the first thing I ever stole...

07:40.000 --> 07:42.123
And it's a shameful reminder
of your criminal past.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.811
We know.
We haven't stolen anything

07:44.888 --> 07:46.729
since we left Corona.

07:47.500 --> 07:48.884
Honest!

07:49.222 --> 07:50.718
But, we had no choice.

07:50.795 --> 07:53.549
This monkey holds a very
important secret...

07:55.918 --> 07:57.774
<i>Red and me are
walking through the forest,</i>

07:57.851 --> 08:00.217
<i>and this weird lady comes out
of nowhere and says,</i>

08:00.294 --> 08:01.881
<i>"Have you heard of this psychic?</i>

08:01.958 --> 08:04.264
<i>"He can tell you
your future and your past</i>

08:04.341 --> 08:05.702
<i>"for one silver piece!</i>

08:05.801 --> 08:07.917
<i>It's a special one-time-only offer."</i>

08:07.994 --> 08:10.284
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on.
One silver piece?</i>

08:10.361 --> 08:11.873
<i>She charged us five!</i>

08:11.950 --> 08:12.960
<i>She's a crook!</i>

08:13.037 --> 08:14.095
<i>And I'm oddly impressed.</i>

08:15.267 --> 08:16.906
<i>So then, this monkey comes out,</i>

08:16.983 --> 08:18.898
<i>and does a weird
future-predicting dance.</i>

08:18.975 --> 08:22.401
<i>Then he gets this funny look on
his face and grabs my necklace.</i>

08:22.538 --> 08:24.001
<i>The weird lady says,</i>

08:24.101 --> 08:25.415
<i>"The necklace you're wearing</i>

08:25.492 --> 08:27.536
<i>has been in your family
for a long time."</i>

08:27.613 --> 08:28.630
<i>And I think,</i>

08:28.707 --> 08:30.790
<i>how does he know that
this is the only thing</i>

08:30.867 --> 08:32.155
<i>I have left from my family?</i>

08:32.232 --> 08:34.875
<i>Then, she reads our fortune.</i>

08:35.022 --> 08:38.207
<i>"Follow the leaf to find your tree."</i>

08:38.284 --> 08:40.543
<i>Tree? Like, a family tree?</i>

08:40.620 --> 08:42.751
<i>Are you saying I have
a family somewhere?</i>

08:42.828 --> 08:44.918
<i>I didn't even know my family existed.</i>

08:44.995 --> 08:46.202
<i>Then, she tells us,</i>

08:46.279 --> 08:47.937
<i>"If it is your family you seek,</i>

08:48.014 --> 08:49.071
<i>"Vigor can show you.</i>

08:49.148 --> 08:51.285
<i>But you gotta give
the monkey more money."</i>

08:51.362 --> 08:53.450
<i>When she finds out
we're broke, she says,</i>

08:53.527 --> 08:56.026
<i>"No money? No monkey."</i>

08:57.541 --> 08:58.568
<i>So...</i>

09:00.807 --> 09:03.070
<i>We decided to borrow the monkey.</i>

09:03.173 --> 09:04.445
Thieves!

09:06.779 --> 09:07.810
Alright, look,

09:07.887 --> 09:10.076
I understand
why you did what you did,

09:10.153 --> 09:11.608
but no matter what you call it,

09:11.685 --> 09:13.907
borrowing without
permission is stealing.

09:13.984 --> 09:15.001
You have to bring him back.

09:15.068 --> 09:16.071
No, no, no!

09:16.148 --> 09:18.155
I can't bring him back now.

09:18.340 --> 09:20.774
Eugene, I know you want them

09:20.851 --> 09:22.434
to do the right thing.
I do, too.

09:22.511 --> 09:26.719
But, Angry and Red have been
on their own for a long time.

09:26.799 --> 09:29.163
And if there's even
the slightest chance that

09:29.240 --> 09:30.834
Vigor can lead them to a home,

09:30.911 --> 09:32.435
shouldn't we take it?

09:36.342 --> 09:38.108
There isn't a chance,

09:38.185 --> 09:40.149
but fine.

09:41.648 --> 09:42.605
That said,

09:42.682 --> 09:44.707
you have to promise on
Maximus' life

09:44.784 --> 09:47.217
that you will give Vigor back
once the search is done,

09:47.294 --> 09:48.969
and he proves to be a phony.

09:49.046 --> 09:51.284
Is that clear, you two?

09:53.837 --> 09:55.350
Deal.

09:57.015 --> 09:57.754
Yah!

09:57.831 --> 09:59.554
- Monkey germs.
- Okay,

09:59.631 --> 10:02.690
so now, all we've gotta do
is figure out how to get

10:02.767 --> 10:04.647
Vigor to do his thing.

10:04.930 --> 10:08.085
Oh, that won't be
too hard to figure out.

10:09.568 --> 10:11.101
Hey, li'l fella.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.825
Where can we find Angry's family?

10:15.390 --> 10:16.591
Look!

10:24.480 --> 10:26.717
The Wheel of Fortune?

10:28.616 --> 10:30.433
Why would he eat it?

10:30.510 --> 10:32.114
Well, it probably means his diet

10:32.191 --> 10:33.641
is deficient in fiber.

10:41.446 --> 10:42.619
Red is right!

10:42.696 --> 10:45.622
There's a city named Fortuna
not too far from here.

10:45.699 --> 10:48.159
That's what Wheel of Fortune meant!

10:48.236 --> 10:49.676
Fortune, Fortuna?

10:49.753 --> 10:51.207
Come on!

10:51.284 --> 10:53.110
You got, "Fortuna," out of,
"Wheel of Fortune?"

10:53.177 --> 10:54.017
That's a coincidence.

10:54.094 --> 10:55.547
Is it a coincidence, Vigor?

10:55.624 --> 10:57.040
Blink twice for, "yes,"

10:57.117 --> 10:58.931
and once for, "no."

11:01.533 --> 11:04.204
Oh! Oh! What was that?

11:04.281 --> 11:07.597
Why, it looks like a single eye-blink.

11:07.674 --> 11:09.751
Is that a coincidence?

11:09.828 --> 11:11.166
Hmm?

11:26.486 --> 11:28.441
This place gives me the creeps.

11:29.514 --> 11:31.547
Eh, it's nothing to worry about.

11:31.624 --> 11:33.052
It's just a quiet, little town.

11:34.794 --> 11:37.444
With sad, foreboding crying.

11:44.808 --> 11:47.268
Beware!

11:50.410 --> 11:51.786
Okay. Psychic monkeys,

11:51.863 --> 11:53.977
and now we've got a talking
octopus, I presume?

11:54.054 --> 11:56.336
Yeah, sure. That's,
that's normal. Why not?

11:56.413 --> 11:59.081
Ye scared the whole town, ye did!

11:59.158 --> 12:01.407
We thought you were...

12:02.420 --> 12:03.853
The Daylights!

12:04.991 --> 12:06.896
What are the Daylights?

12:07.076 --> 12:08.824
The Daylight Thieves.

12:08.901 --> 12:12.249
Nasty crooks of the worst kind they be!

12:12.326 --> 12:15.547
They stole my one-of-a-kind
mahogany piccolo.

12:15.624 --> 12:18.525
And now, I have no instrument!

12:18.602 --> 12:22.100
'Twas a fine piccolo as piccolos be.

12:22.177 --> 12:24.541
It really was.
It really was.

12:24.618 --> 12:26.184
Alack!

12:26.261 --> 12:30.554
Alas! What is a minstrel
without his trusty piccolo?

12:30.631 --> 12:32.050
Just a lonely man

12:32.127 --> 12:34.784
in fancy, ragged pantaloons.

12:34.861 --> 12:38.389
Beware the Daylight Thieves!

12:38.466 --> 12:41.944
Beware! Beware!

12:42.021 --> 12:43.889
- And, scene!
- Ow!

12:48.534 --> 12:50.739
Vigor says we need to go this way.

12:54.128 --> 12:55.832
Eugene, what is it?

12:55.909 --> 12:57.674
Look, Blondie,
I'm just worried, that's all.

12:57.751 --> 12:59.848
I mean,
what if we've come all this way,

12:59.925 --> 13:01.468
and she finds nothing?

13:03.192 --> 13:04.414
Don't worry.

13:05.605 --> 13:06.936
Whatever happens,

13:07.013 --> 13:08.694
we'll be there for them.

13:10.127 --> 13:11.682
Nyah!

13:12.982 --> 13:14.130
Monkey...

13:17.763 --> 13:18.856
I don't get it.

13:18.933 --> 13:20.396
It should be here.

13:20.473 --> 13:21.666
It might be.

13:21.743 --> 13:23.024
I...

13:23.101 --> 13:25.028
can't see a thing through this mist.

13:25.105 --> 13:26.872
Well, the end of
the line is Snake Canyon,

13:26.949 --> 13:28.238
and that's kind of...

13:31.244 --> 13:32.460
Hard to miss.

13:32.537 --> 13:34.937
Vigor, this is a dead end.

13:35.014 --> 13:36.311
What do we do now?

13:38.802 --> 13:40.382
Eugene,
do you have another coin?

13:40.459 --> 13:41.637
Oh no. I say we go back,

13:41.714 --> 13:43.229
return the monkey
to the weird old lady,

13:43.296 --> 13:44.286
and call it a day.

13:44.363 --> 13:45.401
You hear that, Viggy?

13:45.478 --> 13:48.490
You're not getting one more
shiny outta this guy, ya got it?

13:52.291 --> 13:54.112
Vigor, what is it?

13:54.642 --> 13:56.432
Look! Look!

13:59.209 --> 14:00.829
And there's a bridge!

14:00.906 --> 14:03.463
Anybody could've seen that.

14:03.540 --> 14:05.234
Monkey see, monkey point!

14:05.311 --> 14:07.385
Oh, Eugene.
Remind me again.

14:07.462 --> 14:10.145
"If there's one thing
I don't believe in,

14:10.222 --> 14:11.579
it's fortune tellers."

14:11.656 --> 14:13.208
But, what, ugh,

14:13.285 --> 14:14.910
what was that second thing

14:14.987 --> 14:16.412
that you don't believe in?

14:16.489 --> 14:18.112
Fortune tellers that are also,

14:18.189 --> 14:20.710
ugh, what again?

14:20.881 --> 14:22.137
Oh, whatever. I give up.

14:22.214 --> 14:23.802
Lead the way, monkey boy.

14:23.879 --> 14:24.935
Ugh.

14:27.615 --> 14:28.984
But let the record show

14:29.061 --> 14:31.263
that I follow only out
of a sense of obligation

14:31.340 --> 14:33.075
to the group as a whole!

14:44.791 --> 14:46.791
Look! There's people inside!

14:46.868 --> 14:47.972
Look, I know you're excited,

14:48.039 --> 14:50.108
but let's play it cool. Okay?

14:50.285 --> 14:52.609
Seeing you will probably
be a shock to them,

14:52.686 --> 14:54.868
so we should do the talking first.

14:57.332 --> 14:59.389
Mom! It's me!

14:59.466 --> 15:01.320
Your daughter!

15:02.052 --> 15:03.708
I know you weren't expecting this,

15:03.785 --> 15:05.831
but Vigor told us to
follow this leaf symbol

15:05.908 --> 15:07.896
on the necklace you left
me with to the tree,

15:07.973 --> 15:09.783
and we weren't sure if
we would find anything,

15:09.860 --> 15:12.718
but we did and now we
can be together forever!

15:12.795 --> 15:14.636
Uh, this is Vigor,

15:14.713 --> 15:16.158
and what she's saying here is,

15:16.235 --> 15:17.906
you are her long-lost family

15:17.983 --> 15:19.598
and she's come to live with you.

15:19.957 --> 15:21.037
So...

15:21.105 --> 15:22.138
Congrats!

15:25.223 --> 15:26.677
Finally!

15:26.858 --> 15:29.436
After all these years!

15:30.427 --> 15:31.786
William, our...

15:31.863 --> 15:34.607
our little girl has come home!

15:34.705 --> 15:36.248
What was that, Petunia?

15:38.303 --> 15:40.067
I thought
we would never see you again.

15:40.144 --> 15:42.045
Thank goodness you're home.

15:43.264 --> 15:45.577
Wait. You gotta take Red, too.

15:45.654 --> 15:46.815
We're a package deal.

15:46.892 --> 15:49.307
Oh, of course she's welcome.

15:59.058 --> 16:01.326
Thank you.

16:10.665 --> 16:13.629
I understand you had
your doubts about Vigor, Eugene.

16:13.706 --> 16:16.171
But, he did lead us
all the way here.

16:16.248 --> 16:18.768
And just look
how happy the girls are.

16:18.845 --> 16:21.085
I, uh, I... I dunno, Rapunzel.

16:21.162 --> 16:23.295
I just have this feeling
like something's not right.

16:23.372 --> 16:24.778
Maybe we should go back.

16:24.855 --> 16:26.739
Dee!

16:31.138 --> 16:34.845
Vigor, did you take that
whistle from their house?

16:34.922 --> 16:35.982
Blondie,

16:36.129 --> 16:37.526
that's no whistle.

16:39.185 --> 16:41.732
That's a piccolo.

16:41.913 --> 16:44.411
A mahogany piccolo.

16:48.540 --> 16:49.698
Faster, everyone!

16:49.775 --> 16:51.686
The girls are in big trouble!

16:54.045 --> 16:56.112
Wah! Whoa! Rapunzel!

16:56.189 --> 16:57.305
Eugene!

17:01.994 --> 17:03.778
Making yourselves at home?

17:05.837 --> 17:07.377
I wouldn't.

17:08.863 --> 17:10.361
They won't be coming back.

17:10.438 --> 17:11.457
Good.

17:11.546 --> 17:14.221
Now that we're alone,
we can be completely honest.

17:14.298 --> 17:16.867
We aren't your family,
and this isn't our house.

17:16.944 --> 17:18.583
It's our hideout.

17:18.660 --> 17:20.003
We're...

17:20.241 --> 17:22.294
The Daylight Thieves.

17:23.426 --> 17:24.618
I don't get it.

17:24.695 --> 17:27.019
Why take us in
if you don't want us?

17:27.096 --> 17:29.801
And turn away our long lost child?

17:29.997 --> 17:31.699
Could a given us away.

17:31.776 --> 17:33.583
Not worth losing our hideout.

17:33.660 --> 17:35.242
Was better safe than sorry.

17:36.471 --> 17:37.612
Yeah!

17:37.689 --> 17:39.317
And now that we're safe,

17:39.394 --> 17:42.051
you're gonna be real sorry.

17:42.128 --> 17:44.017
Just like your friends.

17:56.616 --> 17:57.815
Eugene!

17:57.892 --> 17:59.614
Don't worry, I'm coming.

18:01.380 --> 18:02.571
No!

18:02.648 --> 18:05.099
No, no, stay where you are.
I'll find a way up.

18:09.221 --> 18:10.246
Ooh!

18:11.390 --> 18:12.655
Of course, that would be easier

18:12.732 --> 18:15.114
if I could see my hand
in front of my face.

18:15.561 --> 18:18.036
Or without a monkey on my head!

18:22.168 --> 18:23.465
Or snak... snakes!

18:23.542 --> 18:24.659
Oh boy.

18:24.736 --> 18:26.368
This place is called Snake Canyon.

18:26.445 --> 18:27.662
Of course because snakes!

18:27.739 --> 18:29.712
That's why you're afraid
right now, got it?

18:29.789 --> 18:31.005
Eugene!

18:31.647 --> 18:33.138
Eugene!

18:33.440 --> 18:35.167
So! How do you get outta here?

18:37.082 --> 18:39.274
Right! Smart! Be a monkey.

18:39.351 --> 18:41.251
Alright, ignore the snakes, Fitzherbert.

18:41.328 --> 18:43.178
Ignore the snakes.

18:43.255 --> 18:46.422
They're just really long, gross
turtles without shells or legs!

18:46.499 --> 18:47.714
That's all!

18:48.427 --> 18:49.993
Oh!

18:50.070 --> 18:51.070
Ah!

18:56.701 --> 18:57.803
Huh?

19:02.707 --> 19:05.097
I thought I told you to stay up there.

19:05.174 --> 19:08.417
Yes, but, "If you see someone fall..."

19:08.494 --> 19:10.167
"Pick 'em up." Yeah, yeah, I know.

19:16.121 --> 19:18.304
You let those little girls...

19:20.059 --> 19:21.381
Go?

19:22.428 --> 19:24.784
Oh, man, I love these girls.

19:24.861 --> 19:25.919
Red?

19:25.996 --> 19:27.500
Where's Angry?

19:42.648 --> 19:44.897
I, I shoulda known better.

19:45.107 --> 19:46.802
I don't know why I believed

19:46.879 --> 19:48.171
that stupid monkey.

19:48.468 --> 19:49.878
Guess I just wanted to believe

19:49.955 --> 19:51.660
I had a family so bad,

19:51.737 --> 19:53.309
that I fooled myself.

19:58.596 --> 20:01.308
"Follow the leaf to find your tree."

20:01.385 --> 20:02.401
Hey...

20:02.522 --> 20:04.336
Did you know that
when I found Rapunzel

20:04.413 --> 20:05.667
I was looking for a crown?

20:05.744 --> 20:07.336
And when Rapunzel found me,

20:07.413 --> 20:09.406
she was chasing lights
in the sky.

20:09.483 --> 20:11.349
That's what we thought
would bring us happiness.

20:11.416 --> 20:13.047
- That's weird, right?
- So?

20:13.124 --> 20:14.812
Why are you telling me this?

20:14.893 --> 20:15.995
Well, because you thought

20:16.072 --> 20:18.115
finding your tree would
bring you to your family.

20:18.192 --> 20:19.512
But, who's by your side
right now,

20:19.589 --> 20:21.187
when you're feeling your lowest?

20:23.936 --> 20:25.695
You have a family in Red.

20:26.492 --> 20:28.365
And if the journey
helps you realize that,

20:28.442 --> 20:30.760
then following the leaf
helped you find your tree.

20:34.761 --> 20:37.151
So I don't forget
who my family is.

20:39.091 --> 20:40.319
Mmm.

20:54.099 --> 20:55.308
Vigor!

20:55.385 --> 20:57.390
We're real sorry
we took your monkey.

20:57.493 --> 21:01.229
Did he show you
what you needed to find?

21:01.306 --> 21:03.181
Yeah, he did.

21:03.940 --> 21:05.044
Then...

21:05.121 --> 21:08.026
that'll be five silver pieces!

21:09.067 --> 21:10.389
That's a good one.

21:11.374 --> 21:13.161
Oh, you're serious.
Yes, you are.

21:13.238 --> 21:14.638
Alright, you heard the lady, girls.

21:14.709 --> 21:17.040
Looks like you're gonna have
to figure out some way to pay.

21:19.775 --> 21:21.581
Man, I hate it when they do that.

21:29.220 --> 21:31.724
So, Vigor made
a believer out of you?

21:31.801 --> 21:33.648
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

21:39.331 --> 21:40.940
Hah!

21:41.902 --> 21:43.741
What are you looking at?

21:48.504 --> 21:50.623
Just looking forward to
getting back to our date.

21:50.700 --> 21:52.756
And, what do you predict
we'll do?

21:52.833 --> 21:55.437
Hmm...
The spirits tell me...

21:55.514 --> 21:57.685
whatever it is,
it'll be free!

21:57.762 --> 21:58.632
Free?

21:58.717 --> 21:59.865
Yes because that lady

21:59.942 --> 22:02.054
and her cheeky monkey
took all our cash.
