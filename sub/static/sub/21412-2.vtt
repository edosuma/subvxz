00:01.917 --> 00:04.852
<i>[Spider-Man] The cool thing about
transferring to a school like Horizon High</i>

00:04.854 --> 00:07.288
<i>is that it's not only a
great place to invent things,</i>

00:07.290 --> 00:09.890
<i>it's also a great place
to reinvent things.</i>

00:09.892 --> 00:11.859
<i>Namely, myself.</i>

00:11.861 --> 00:14.462
<i>So instead of being known
as the school flake,</i>

00:14.464 --> 00:18.299
<i>I now get a second chance at being
good ol' reliable Peter Parker.</i>

00:18.301 --> 00:20.767
<i>[crash] Problem is...
[grunting]</i>

00:22.037 --> 00:24.739
<i>I haven't made it to school
because I had to stop this Scorpion</i>

00:24.741 --> 00:27.708
<i>from stealing a gem
from the science museum.</i>

00:27.710 --> 00:33.514
So this is the Spider-Man I've
been hearing so much about. [grunts]

00:35.984 --> 00:40.321
[grunts] Give it some time.
I grow on ya, like a pimple.

00:40.323 --> 00:43.891
Then you deserve to be eliminated
like one. [grunts, groans]

00:43.893 --> 00:46.727
<i>I really did have the best intentions
of getting to school on time.</i>

00:46.729 --> 00:48.629
<i>It was just an hour ago
that things went wrong.</i>

00:48.631 --> 00:51.232
Pew! Did you leave your gym
clothes in your backpack?

00:51.234 --> 00:55.403
Oh, yeah...
Yeah, that must be it.

00:55.405 --> 00:59.907
So, uh, Harry, how was your
first day back at Midtown?

00:59.909 --> 01:03.477
Don't ask, 'kay?
Hey, how was your first day?

01:03.479 --> 01:06.631
Oh, I just met some cool
people, got to work with some

01:06.632 --> 01:09.784
awesome equipment, and today
I'm getting my very own lab!

01:09.786 --> 01:11.786
Fantastic.

01:11.788 --> 01:13.521
But, hey, do me a favor.

01:13.523 --> 01:16.157
Can you grab some of
the experiments in my lab?

01:16.159 --> 01:19.126
Horizon's policy is to
confiscate anything left behind,

01:19.128 --> 01:24.765
and I'd prefer these
to remain... uh, private.

01:24.767 --> 01:26.767
What kind of experiments?

01:26.769 --> 01:29.937
You know scientists
never reveal their secrets.

01:29.939 --> 01:32.873
Uh, that's magicians,
not scientists.

01:32.875 --> 01:38.012
- Whatever. Just do me a solid.
- I'll... see what I can do.

01:38.014 --> 01:40.614
See ya.
[phone chimes]

01:40.616 --> 01:44.285
Uh-oh. Looks like there's a crazy
guy attacking the science museum.

01:44.287 --> 01:47.355
Twenty minutes
before school starts. Huh.

01:47.357 --> 01:49.990
I can probably stop this guy
and get my costume washed.

01:49.992 --> 01:53.361
<i>And that was my first miscalculation
of the day. [people clamoring]</i>

01:53.363 --> 01:55.996
- Yah! Hah!
- Watch it, buddy!

01:55.998 --> 01:57.898
You break it, you buy it!
[grunts]

01:57.900 --> 01:59.633
[yells]

02:01.737 --> 02:05.829
Or you break it,
I get crushed by it!

[people clamoring]

02:19.088 --> 02:21.222
Oh, no, you don't!

02:22.924 --> 02:26.427
Museum members get 20% off
life-saving acts of heroism. [grunts]

02:26.429 --> 02:29.397
[people screaming]
[grunting]

02:29.399 --> 02:32.806
[groans] This guy's like
a bull in a China shop.

02:32.841 --> 02:35.202
[grunting]

02:35.204 --> 02:37.204
Time to rein this bull in.

02:37.206 --> 02:39.206
[panting]
[grunts]

02:39.208 --> 02:43.344
[grunts] And this is clearly my
second miscalculation of the day.

02:43.346 --> 02:46.180
[yelling]

02:47.115 --> 02:49.216
[grunts]
Whoa!

02:49.218 --> 02:51.752
[yelling]

02:51.754 --> 02:54.955
Oh, this tail has the strength
of a wrecking ball.

02:54.957 --> 02:57.925
And I happen to know a place where
there are less things to wreck.

02:57.927 --> 02:59.794
Hey, Scorpion!

02:59.796 --> 03:02.930
I hear it's the tiny scorpions
that are the dangerous ones.

03:02.932 --> 03:05.933
- Wanna prove me wrong?
- [grunts] Gladly.

03:05.935 --> 03:07.535
Whoa.
[grunts]

03:09.137 --> 03:10.438
[grunts]

03:11.707 --> 03:14.108
Come on! Really?
[grunts]

03:14.110 --> 03:16.427
[blows]
Yeah! [beeps]

03:16.462 --> 03:19.016
[yells]
Nice! Aah!

03:19.051 --> 03:23.484
[evil laughter] Defeated by
your own faulty equipment.

03:23.486 --> 03:24.985
[horn blaring]
[evil laughter]

03:24.987 --> 03:27.555
Web cartridge shattered.
But luckily,

03:27.557 --> 03:30.191
it was a two-for-one sale.
[horn blaring]

03:35.664 --> 03:37.965
<i>So long, Spider-Kid!
[grunting]</i>

03:37.967 --> 03:42.069
[laughing] Hey! Nobody
rides for free in this town!

03:43.839 --> 03:45.005
[grunts]

03:45.007 --> 03:46.907
Aahh!

03:46.909 --> 03:48.175
[groans]

03:48.177 --> 03:51.011
Relax, folks.
Spider-Man is...

03:51.013 --> 03:52.980
- Ow! Hey! Ouch!
- Get away from me!

03:52.982 --> 03:57.117
- Stinky!
- Hmm. [groans]

03:57.119 --> 04:01.394
- What is that stench?
- I could say it's the subway,

04:01.429 --> 04:04.291
but I think we both know
I need to wash my costume.

04:04.293 --> 04:08.195
[grunting]
Fine! I'll clean it tonight!

04:08.197 --> 04:10.998
[both grunting]

04:16.971 --> 04:19.807
Great thing about new heroes...

04:19.809 --> 04:22.543
their aim still needs practice.

04:22.545 --> 04:24.812
Really? 'Cause I was aiming

04:24.814 --> 04:27.745
- for the emergency brake behind you.
- Huh?

04:27.780 --> 04:29.350
[grunts]
[screeching]

04:29.352 --> 04:32.219
[horn blaring]
[grunts]

04:37.025 --> 04:40.327
Hello, New York!
[crowd groaning]

04:40.329 --> 04:41.795
[coughing]

04:41.797 --> 04:44.732
I know, right?
This guy reeks.

04:44.734 --> 04:48.235
This is for you.
And this is for you.

04:48.237 --> 04:53.173
- Hey, nabbing criminals is our job!
- And I salute you for it.

04:53.175 --> 04:56.413
[clangs]
Ow.

04:56.512 --> 05:00.548
I can't believe I'm late for my
first meeting with my class advisor.

05:02.417 --> 05:06.587
Hey, buddy. I'm supposed to meet
Dr. Otto Octavius here.

05:06.589 --> 05:09.356
Any idea where he might be?

05:09.358 --> 05:11.091
Follow me.

05:12.994 --> 05:16.830
Oh, thanks so much.
Hopefully, he won't notice I'm late.

05:16.832 --> 05:19.400
Rumor has it he can be really cranky.

05:19.402 --> 05:22.236
[stammers] I-I mean, don't get
me wrong, the man's a genius.

05:22.238 --> 05:24.572
He even won the city's
science prize last year.

05:24.574 --> 05:28.250
Oh, yeah. There it is. But why
is the mayor giving it to you?

05:28.285 --> 05:31.779
Could he not make it?
Or did you...

05:31.781 --> 05:33.614
Did he...

05:33.616 --> 05:35.616
You're Dr. Octavius, aren't you?

05:35.618 --> 05:41.055
And you are late, Mr. Parker.
Not to mention unobservant.

05:41.057 --> 05:43.257
I'm so sorry, Dr. Octavius.

05:43.259 --> 05:46.678
It's just that you
look younger than I do.

05:47.128 --> 05:51.532
- Great first impression, Parker.
- This is your new lab.

05:51.534 --> 05:55.035
Oh. Wait. This can't be right.
This is Harry's lab.

05:55.037 --> 05:58.806
Harry Osborn is no longer
at this school.

05:58.808 --> 06:00.908
Yeah, but he'll be back.

06:00.910 --> 06:05.148
- Isn't there another lab I could use?
- No. [grunts]

06:05.183 --> 06:09.283
There are no other labs
available at this moment.

06:09.285 --> 06:12.286
[grunts] Now, rip that
nameplate off for me.

06:12.288 --> 06:16.323
I... I feel really weird about this.
Maybe I don't need a lab.

06:16.325 --> 06:19.059
Trust me,
you're going to need a lab.

06:19.061 --> 06:23.556
Now, take that name down
and put this one up.

06:29.337 --> 06:33.418
Once this place is cleared out,
it will all be yours.

06:34.509 --> 06:36.343
How long will that take?

06:36.345 --> 06:40.514
- Depends on how fast you can move.
- I have to move everything?

06:40.516 --> 06:45.396
All confiscated experiments go in
the vault at the end of the hall.

06:54.262 --> 06:56.363
What is all this, Harry?

06:56.365 --> 06:59.166
What in the world
were you working on?

07:00.101 --> 07:02.970
<i>Oh. My Spidey-Sense.</i>

07:02.972 --> 07:05.172
Peter! I was told
I'd find you in here.

07:05.174 --> 07:08.475
Come with me. I wanna
introduce you to someone.

07:08.477 --> 07:11.145
Uh, has anyone seen Gwen Stacy?

07:11.147 --> 07:14.281
- I wanted her to meet Peter.
- You know Gwen.

07:14.283 --> 07:17.685
The princess of preparation
is out collecting samples.

07:17.687 --> 07:19.887
But we can show the newbie around.

07:19.889 --> 07:22.723
We sure can. Welcome
to the Think Tank, Pete.

07:22.725 --> 07:26.360
This is where we mix,
mingle, and motivate. [music]

07:26.362 --> 07:29.863
What he means is, this is where
we show off the work we're doing.

07:29.865 --> 07:32.900
Yeah. Check out this
security robot I made.

07:32.902 --> 07:34.902
<i>[same voice, digitized]
Yo! Something isn't right.</i>

07:34.904 --> 07:36.804
I got tired of
the usual robotic voice,

07:36.806 --> 07:38.972
so I just replaced it with my own.

07:38.974 --> 07:40.990
<i>- Huh? Let go!
- You're outta here, buddy.</i>

07:41.025 --> 07:42.976
You must not be
in the system yet.

07:42.978 --> 07:44.311
Uhh...

07:44.313 --> 07:47.347
Oh, looks like I get to show off
my new scrambler.

07:47.349 --> 07:50.084
It can cut the power to
anything mechanical. Hey...

07:50.086 --> 07:52.920
Nice work, Anya.
[grunts]

07:52.922 --> 07:55.589
Now, students,
regarding Miles's robot,

07:55.591 --> 07:57.891
how could this situation
have been avoided?

07:57.893 --> 08:01.361
- Visual recognition?
- Um, automatic updates?

08:01.363 --> 08:06.318
Uh, boxers instead of briefs?
[laughter]

08:06.936 --> 08:09.870
Is that the best idea
you can come up with?

08:09.872 --> 08:12.740
Man, Gwen Stacy
is gonna eat you alive.

08:12.742 --> 08:16.577
Let's not be so hard on Peter.
It is his first week.

08:16.579 --> 08:20.547
I'm sure he has plenty of ideas
he can contribute to the group.

08:20.549 --> 08:23.283
- Don't you, Peter?
- Uh... [nervous chuckle]

08:23.285 --> 08:26.553
[stammering]
O-Of course I have ideas.

08:26.555 --> 08:28.255
I-I have tons of ideas.

08:28.257 --> 08:31.592
Starting with the ideas to keep
my ideas safely in my backpack.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.760
[quietly]
Stop saying "ideas."

08:33.763 --> 08:35.863
Be right backpack.

08:35.865 --> 08:38.131
Man, do I feel out of my league.

08:38.134 --> 08:39.933
But you can do this, Parker.

08:39.934 --> 08:43.403
They want ideas.
You'll give 'em ideas.

08:43.405 --> 08:47.207
[clock ticking rapidly]

08:47.209 --> 08:48.776
And I got nothin'.

08:48.778 --> 08:52.212
Gotta relax.
Something will come to me.

08:52.214 --> 08:54.214
- Huh?
- Having a little trouble?

08:54.216 --> 08:56.984
I'm staying late to study the stars.

08:56.986 --> 09:00.888
Even though the sun is a star
and can be seen during the day.

09:00.890 --> 09:02.517
Peter, there's no need to worry.

09:02.518 --> 09:04.958
Lots of students stay late
to work on their projects.

09:04.960 --> 09:09.129
An idea will come to you. Just start
with something that's close to your heart.

09:09.131 --> 09:12.466
- See ya tomorrow.
- Thanks, Max.

09:12.468 --> 09:15.002
Close to my heart, huh?

09:15.004 --> 09:18.739
Then this might be the perfect time
to perfect my Spider-Man costume.

09:26.514 --> 09:28.882
[beeping]

09:32.153 --> 09:35.522
Sorry, Aunt May.
I just lost track of the hour.

09:35.524 --> 09:39.293
Time flies when you're having fun.
I'll be home soon. [beeps]

09:39.295 --> 09:41.829
<i>- [robot] Yo! Something isn't right.
- Huh?</i>

09:41.831 --> 09:45.265
<i>- [distorted] Yo! Something isn't right.
- Uh-oh.</i>

09:45.267 --> 09:49.937
I don't recall anyone working on
a techno-organic thingamajigger.

09:49.939 --> 09:52.706
I don't suppose you've got
a student ID, do ya?

09:52.708 --> 09:54.641
Whoa. Whoa.
[grunts]

09:54.643 --> 09:56.543
[grunts, groans]

09:56.545 --> 09:59.473
Hey! Nobody pushes me around!

09:59.508 --> 10:01.515
Actually, that's not true.

10:01.517 --> 10:03.617
Everyone pushes me around.

10:03.619 --> 10:06.653
But I think I know
someone who can't.

10:06.655 --> 10:10.123
Something tells me that's not
a school-sanctioned project.

10:10.125 --> 10:13.360
So hand it over.

10:13.362 --> 10:17.369
Uh-oh. I think I know
what that does now.

10:17.370 --> 10:18.370
[boom]

10:19.400 --> 10:21.335
[yells, grunts]

10:21.337 --> 10:24.471
Wow. No wonder Tony Stark
wears an armored suit.

10:24.473 --> 10:26.139
This job hurts.

10:26.141 --> 10:28.575
I was hoping to test my new
tech out before using it,

10:28.577 --> 10:30.344
but this leaves me no choice.

10:30.346 --> 10:33.380
And almost no pants.

10:33.382 --> 10:36.542
<i>Time to debut the new
Spidey fashion line.</i>

10:46.995 --> 10:49.496
Hold it right there!
Let's see how you do

10:49.498 --> 10:51.832
against new
and improved Spidey.

10:51.834 --> 10:53.233
[grunts]

10:53.235 --> 10:55.235
Not a fan of the new look, are ya?

10:55.237 --> 10:58.405
Give it some time.
It grows on ya, like a pimple.

10:58.407 --> 11:00.774
Oh, wait.
I used that one already.

11:00.776 --> 11:03.610
Whoa!
[grunts]

11:03.612 --> 11:05.946
Time to workshop
some new material.

11:05.948 --> 11:08.916
So maybe you could quit trying
to disrupt my evening.

11:08.918 --> 11:11.151
[grunts]

11:13.421 --> 11:14.571
[grunts]

11:14.572 --> 11:19.526
- Look out!
- Whoa! W-W-W-Whoa! [grunts]

11:19.528 --> 11:21.528
Spider-Man?

11:21.530 --> 11:23.563
- What's going on?
- I don't know exactly,

11:23.565 --> 11:27.534
but whatever that thing was,
I let it get away.

11:27.536 --> 11:29.269
You saved my life.

11:29.271 --> 11:31.271
And if it was a choice
between the two,

11:31.273 --> 11:32.873
I think you picked the right one.

11:32.875 --> 11:34.541
Thanks.
I appreciate that.

11:34.543 --> 11:37.644
Hey, do I know you?
You sound familiar.

11:37.646 --> 11:39.980
Uhh...
[deep voice] Uh, no.

11:39.982 --> 11:41.748
I don't think we've met before.

11:41.750 --> 11:45.285
I just have one of those
familiar-sounding voices.

11:45.287 --> 11:48.121
- You okay?
- Uh... Mm. Huh?

11:48.123 --> 11:50.958
Uh, no. I'm fine.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.160
Guess my robot
needs more work, huh?

11:53.162 --> 11:54.728
[normal voice]
What would give you that idea?

11:54.730 --> 11:57.564
<i>[distorted]
Something isn't... [powering down]</i>

11:57.566 --> 11:59.599
[grunts]
Phew.

11:59.601 --> 12:02.669
What a tough day. Let's hope
they're not all like this.

12:02.671 --> 12:04.604
<i>- [Aunt May] It's not that easy.
- Huh?</i>

12:04.606 --> 12:07.407
Without Ben here, the bills
are starting to pile up.

12:07.409 --> 12:09.476
I don't know what
I'm gonna do, Anna.

12:09.478 --> 12:11.411
I had no idea it was so expensive.

12:11.413 --> 12:14.399
I hope she's not talking
about what I think she is.

12:14.434 --> 12:15.582
[beeping]

12:15.584 --> 12:18.018
The tuition bill!
I knew it!

12:18.020 --> 12:19.586
And job listings?

12:19.588 --> 12:21.855
No, Aunt May.
This stops here.

12:21.857 --> 12:25.592
I won't let you take an extra job
just so that I can stay at Horizon.

12:25.594 --> 12:28.662
I should've never
accepted this position.

12:30.465 --> 12:32.599
You okay, Pete?
You seem a little down.

12:32.601 --> 12:35.035
Just money troubles.
I hate to say it,

12:35.037 --> 12:37.637
but I don't think I can afford
to go to Horizon.

12:37.639 --> 12:39.539
- Do you need some help?
- No!

12:39.541 --> 12:43.343
I couldn't live with myself if
I took your lab and your money.

12:43.345 --> 12:46.646
I have to figure this out
on my own. But thanks.

12:46.648 --> 12:48.515
Up to you.
But after last night,

12:48.517 --> 12:50.717
I'm surprised there's still
a school to go to.

12:50.719 --> 12:52.986
Is it true you were there
when it happened?

12:52.988 --> 12:56.173
- Yeah.
- Wow. And that thing just started

12:56.174 --> 12:58.892
- ripping the place apart, huh?
- Not really.

12:58.894 --> 13:02.195
It sort of... just
went after your stuff.

13:02.197 --> 13:04.531
- My stuff?
- Yeah.

13:04.533 --> 13:07.034
The exact same stuff
you asked me to get for you.

13:07.036 --> 13:09.302
W-What's that
supposed to mean?

13:09.304 --> 13:12.472
- You think I had something to do with it?
- No! Of course not.

13:12.474 --> 13:14.908
I just... I don't know
what I'm saying.

13:14.910 --> 13:17.310
But I was able to snag this for ya.

13:17.312 --> 13:21.548
- Wanna tell me what it is?
- I can't tell you, Pete. It's...

13:22.750 --> 13:24.718
Look, my dad is creating
a school for me.

13:24.720 --> 13:27.554
A school that'll be in direct
competition with Horizon.

13:27.556 --> 13:29.089
I have to keep some things secret.

13:29.091 --> 13:32.592
- So you can create bombs?
- [slurping] Bombs?

13:32.594 --> 13:36.229
[laughs]
It's not a bomb. It's a...

13:36.231 --> 13:40.349
Ah, very clever, Parker.
Very clever.

13:40.384 --> 13:44.361
But I'm not that easy.
This baby will remain a mystery.

13:46.274 --> 13:48.508
[sighs]
Much like the answer to,

13:48.510 --> 13:51.362
"How will I afford to stay at Horizon?"

13:54.690 --> 13:56.450
[music]

13:56.451 --> 13:58.785
What am I doing, Uncle Ben?

13:58.787 --> 14:02.173
It's hard enough splitting my
time between being a student

14:02.174 --> 14:05.559
and being a hero, and now I'm
adding janitor into the mix?

14:05.561 --> 14:08.161
When will I have time
to focus on my schoolwork?

14:10.064 --> 14:12.766
<i>Can I go inside and play with
my chemistry set, Uncle Ben?</i>

14:12.768 --> 14:14.401
<i>As soon as we're done
raking leaves, Petey.</i>

14:14.403 --> 14:16.803
<i>Ugh! When I get older,</i>

14:16.805 --> 14:19.106
<i>I'm going to be a scientist
so I don't have to rake leaves.</i>

14:19.108 --> 14:22.275
<i>[chuckling]
You wanna hear a funny story?</i>

14:22.277 --> 14:25.212
<i>When I was your age
I hated to rake leaves.</i>

14:25.214 --> 14:27.814
<i>I would've much rather
been painting model trains.</i>

14:27.816 --> 14:31.485
<i>Then one day,
I came up with an idea.</i>

14:31.487 --> 14:35.122
<i>If I could get everyone in the
neighborhood to pay me to rake</i>

14:35.123 --> 14:38.758
<i>their leaves, I could make
enough money to buy a model train.</i>

14:38.760 --> 14:41.728
<i>And wouldn't you know it?
It worked.</i>

14:41.730 --> 14:43.730
<i>So it just goes to show ya,</i>

14:43.732 --> 14:47.100
<i>sometimes hard work is just
the break your brain needs</i>

14:47.102 --> 14:49.402
<i>to jump-start a new idea.
[chuckles]</i>

14:49.404 --> 14:52.516
<i>Good thinking, Uncle Ben.</i>

14:54.108 --> 14:57.677
[Max] Peter, I just got
the strangest e-mail.

14:57.679 --> 15:00.447
Did you apply for the
janitor job here at Horizon?

15:00.449 --> 15:02.449
I did, Max.

15:02.451 --> 15:05.585
The truth is, my Aunt May really
can't afford to send me here.

15:05.587 --> 15:08.622
So unless I can contribute in some way,
I don't see how I can stay.

15:08.624 --> 15:12.859
I respect that, Peter.
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

15:12.861 --> 15:15.428
I've been thinking about who
can be my new lab assistant.

15:15.430 --> 15:17.430
It wouldn't be much money,
of course,

15:17.432 --> 15:20.000
but it would be enough
to contribute to the bills.

15:20.002 --> 15:24.137
- Are you interested?
- Yes, sir!

15:24.139 --> 15:27.541
Good, then you can start by
helping me with my next project.

15:27.543 --> 15:29.883
You bet! Should I
grab the atom splitter?

15:29.884 --> 15:34.548
- The molecule condenser?
- No, but you can grab a broom.

15:34.550 --> 15:37.050
'Cause I've gotta clean this place
up after last night's break-in.

15:37.052 --> 15:38.818
A broom?

15:38.820 --> 15:40.854
There's nothing wrong
with hard work, Peter.

15:40.856 --> 15:44.041
Sometimes it's just the
break your brain needs

15:44.042 --> 15:47.227
- to jump-start a new idea.
- So I've heard.

15:47.229 --> 15:49.963
And, hey, Anya and I are
heading back to Midtown

15:49.965 --> 15:52.399
to investigate more
into Harry's situation.

15:52.401 --> 15:54.801
- You should come.
- Me?

15:54.803 --> 15:57.837
Sure. You know Harry
better than anyone.

15:57.839 --> 16:00.611
I think we'd benefit
from having you there.

16:02.877 --> 16:05.912
[chattering]

16:05.914 --> 16:09.149
Well, well, well, look
who's back at Midtown High.

16:09.151 --> 16:12.719
Guess you're not so smart
after all, are ya, Osborn?

16:12.721 --> 16:15.822
Smart enough to know
someone set me up, Smythe.

16:15.824 --> 16:17.090
You're a fraud.

16:17.092 --> 16:20.927
And you're as clueless
as your old man.

16:20.929 --> 16:22.996
[grunting]

16:22.998 --> 16:24.531
Boys, stop it!

16:24.533 --> 16:28.935
Uh... Max?
What are you guys doing here?

16:28.937 --> 16:31.438
Talking to people
about your character, Harry.

16:31.440 --> 16:34.541
- You, too, Pete?
- No! I'm just here to...

16:34.543 --> 16:36.276
<i>[loud thud]
[Max, Peter] Huh?</i>

16:36.278 --> 16:39.679
[grunting]
[clamoring]

16:44.752 --> 16:46.254
Harry!

16:46.289 --> 16:47.787
Please be empty. Please be empty.

16:50.024 --> 16:53.193
Hey! Let me go!
[grunting]

16:53.195 --> 16:57.088
Yo! Metal head!
Aah!

16:58.432 --> 17:02.759
First Horizon, now Midtown?
What are you, school shopping?

17:03.938 --> 17:05.972
Nice try.

17:05.973 --> 17:08.942
But if you think I'm gonna let
you just take off with a student,

17:08.944 --> 17:10.944
you don't have a good grip
on the situation.

17:10.945 --> 17:13.566
Or the student, for that matter.

17:14.214 --> 17:17.717
Is this because
I called you "metal head"?

17:17.719 --> 17:20.553
<i>'Cause if you look closer,
you'll see I'm a really nice guy.</i>

17:20.555 --> 17:22.355
Spider-Man, hang on!

17:23.824 --> 17:25.925
[grunts]

17:25.926 --> 17:27.926
Whoa!
Love that piece of tech.

17:27.929 --> 17:31.398
Thanks. Do I know you?
You sound familiar.

17:31.400 --> 17:34.267
[speaking Spanish] _

17:34.269 --> 17:36.736
[yells] I thought I
took this robot down!

17:36.738 --> 17:38.605
Your tech disables machines.
[grunts]

17:38.607 --> 17:41.775
This thing seems to be
semi-organic. [grunts]

17:41.777 --> 17:44.997
<i>And just all around mean!</i>

17:46.006 --> 17:47.073
[clamoring]

17:47.074 --> 17:49.209
[panting] I have to stop
this thing from crushing me.

17:49.211 --> 17:50.810
Wait a minute.

17:50.812 --> 17:53.213
Aah! What are you doing?

17:53.215 --> 17:55.648
Help! This Spider-Man's
trying to get me!

17:55.650 --> 18:00.019
Not you. But clearly, this
thing senses something on you.

18:00.021 --> 18:00.987
[yells]

18:00.989 --> 18:04.632
So, let's give it what it wants.

18:10.030 --> 18:13.500
[sighs] Too bad I wasn't
bitten by an enhanced turtle.

18:13.502 --> 18:17.070
I could really use
a hard outer shell about now.

18:17.072 --> 18:20.240
That guy's a menace.
You all saw it.

18:20.242 --> 18:23.910
- He tried to pull me into the danger.
- That's not true. I was...

18:23.912 --> 18:26.880
Every time you show up,
something bad happens.

18:26.882 --> 18:30.950
- Harry, he saved our lives. Twice now.
- You're being played, Anya.

18:30.952 --> 18:34.954
He's hiding something,
and I intend to prove it.

18:34.956 --> 18:38.208
I'm sorry he feels that way,
Spider-Man. Especially since

18:38.209 --> 18:41.461
saving us from destructions seems
to be a regular thing with you.

18:41.463 --> 18:44.197
Well, this time, I think
we all played a part.

18:44.199 --> 18:47.901
- Awesome.
- We should get one with Peter. [beeps]

18:47.903 --> 18:50.069
- Where is Peter?
- Oh, uh, uh...

18:50.071 --> 18:54.207
Shucks! I'd love to, but, uh,
I got someplace I need to be.

18:54.209 --> 18:55.708
Have a great day!

18:55.710 --> 18:58.645
That guy has
the oddest-sounding voice.

18:58.647 --> 19:01.581
I know. He was even
speaking Spanish earlier.

19:01.583 --> 19:04.651
- Hey, guys. You okay?
- Where were you?

19:04.653 --> 19:06.753
What do you mean, where was I?

19:06.755 --> 19:09.055
There was a giant robot attacking.
I was hiding in the bathroom.

19:09.057 --> 19:12.058
Well, you missed getting
a picture with Spider-Man.

19:12.060 --> 19:15.456
Yeah. I'm gonna post it
on the Horizon High web site.

19:16.330 --> 19:19.065
[chuckles]
You almost had him, Dad.

19:19.067 --> 19:20.800
Don't worry, son.

19:20.802 --> 19:25.971
The Vulture, the Slayers...
all part of his master plan.

19:26.873 --> 19:29.990
[music]

19:32.313 --> 19:33.580
[fake coughing]

19:33.581 --> 19:38.117
- Hey, Aunt May.
- Oh, Peter. You startled me.

19:38.119 --> 19:41.254
Can I get you a piece
of cake or something?

19:41.256 --> 19:43.156
No, you do enough for me,
Aunt May.

19:43.158 --> 19:44.991
In fact, I should do more for you.

19:44.993 --> 19:47.494
Oh, hogwash.
You do plenty.

19:47.496 --> 19:50.497
Just study hard and make
the most of your talents.

19:50.499 --> 19:54.968
- I'll take care of the rest.
- Funny you should mention studying.

19:54.970 --> 19:57.937
I spoke to Max today, and he
said that my grades qualify me

19:57.939 --> 19:59.772
for a partial scholarship to Horizon.

19:59.774 --> 20:03.476
What?
Oh, Peter, that's wonderful!

20:03.478 --> 20:08.047
You are forever making
your uncle and I proud.

20:08.049 --> 20:11.150
Well, now I insist
we have some cake.

20:11.152 --> 20:13.653
Just as soon as I
take out the trash.

20:13.655 --> 20:16.437
Let me, Aunt May.

20:19.360 --> 20:23.062
<i>Anna Watson, you are never
going to believe what happened.</i>

20:23.064 --> 20:26.299
<i>Peter got a scholarship to Horizon.</i>

20:26.301 --> 20:29.302
<i>I know.
I'm so relieved.</i>

20:29.304 --> 20:32.539
Little white lies aside,

20:32.541 --> 20:35.074
this hasn't been such a bad
first day on the job.

20:35.076 --> 20:37.377
In fact, I'm feeling pretty good.
[cooing]

20:37.379 --> 20:39.913
Oh, come on! Really?

20:39.915 --> 20:41.981
You're not the same pigeon
from earlier, are you?

20:41.983 --> 20:46.352
I mean, scientifically speaking,
the odds are 4,750 to one,

20:46.354 --> 20:49.188
but, well, let's just say you are,

20:49.190 --> 20:52.058
so we can get a second chance
at this relationship.

20:52.060 --> 20:55.328
Maybe that's the thing
about second chances. [music]

20:55.330 --> 20:57.764
They're not about
doing things differently,

20:57.766 --> 21:00.333
they're about
seeing things differently.

21:00.335 --> 21:02.936
Like an opportunity
instead of a struggle.

21:02.938 --> 21:05.271
[cooing]

21:05.273 --> 21:08.741
A hero instead of a celebrity.

21:08.743 --> 21:12.178
Or even friends
where you first saw strangers.

21:12.180 --> 21:14.180
You were right, Uncle Ben.

21:14.182 --> 21:16.516
Your talent was
making sense of things.

21:16.518 --> 21:19.385
I don't know if being
a superhero is my talent,

21:19.387 --> 21:21.588
but if you wouldn't mind
keeping an eye on me,

21:21.590 --> 21:23.723
I've got a sense
we could do this together.

21:23.725 --> 21:26.025
[siren wailing]
Huh?

21:27.428 --> 21:31.497
And we might even have some fun.
Whoo-hoo!
