02:07.456 --> 02:10.925
Richard.

02:10.926 --> 02:13.027
Richie.

02:27.476 --> 02:30.778
Hunt me down...

02:30.780 --> 02:33.080
Richard.

02:33.082 --> 02:37.017
Hunt for me.

02:38.920 --> 02:39.854
Richie?

02:39.856 --> 02:41.088
Richie?

02:41.090 --> 02:43.290
Jesus, is that you?

02:45.093 --> 02:46.861
It's Warren... Warren Pritchard.

02:46.863 --> 02:48.262
Your brother sent me to find you.

02:48.264 --> 02:50.331
Could you just put the knife down, please?

02:51.500 --> 02:53.134
Thank you. He's got a job.

02:53.136 --> 02:54.168
It's a big one.

02:56.805 --> 02:58.239
Hey, are you all right?

03:03.044 --> 03:04.512
Come on in!

03:04.514 --> 03:08.315
You heard me, devil dogs and bad bitches!

03:08.317 --> 03:12.520
Come on in for the
all-you-can-lick buffet

03:12.522 --> 03:14.822
of the most beautiful,

03:14.824 --> 03:18.793
tastiest delicacies south of the border!

03:18.795 --> 03:21.028
We've got only one item on
the menu... that's true...

03:21.030 --> 03:23.898
But we've got every flavor
under the Mexican moon!

03:23.900 --> 03:25.933
I did my part.

03:25.935 --> 03:28.936
We got you across the border.

03:28.938 --> 03:31.138
I'm not taking my children
inside. We're done.

03:31.140 --> 03:32.840
Fine.

03:32.842 --> 03:34.875
You three stay out here
with the devil's rejects,

03:34.877 --> 03:36.243
have your own little altamont.

03:38.113 --> 03:39.346
That wasn't the deal.

03:39.348 --> 03:42.016
No, the deal was that we stick together

03:42.018 --> 03:44.852
until Richie and I finish our deal.

03:47.055 --> 03:48.856
Ooh-aah!
LA-LA-LA-LA-LA!

03:48.858 --> 03:52.159
You heard me, devil dogs and bad bitches!

03:52.161 --> 03:54.361
Come on in!

03:54.363 --> 03:57.131
We got pan dulce of every flavor for you

03:57.133 --> 03:58.966
and any way you like it,

03:58.968 --> 04:00.367
with all the fillings...

04:00.369 --> 04:05.139
Camote, piña, calabaza!

04:05.141 --> 04:06.941
Come on in and get it!

04:06.943 --> 04:10.044
Hold it, now. Hold it.

04:10.046 --> 04:13.080
A new item has just been added
on the à la carte menu...

04:13.082 --> 04:15.249
Sweet, hot...

04:16.618 --> 04:18.886
Cherry pie.

04:19.588 --> 04:21.988
Okay, okay. Easy. She's
not gonna be on the menu.

04:21.991 --> 04:23.858
You leave that up to cherry.

04:23.860 --> 04:24.892
Oh!

04:25.861 --> 04:27.261
Come on, come on.

04:28.063 --> 04:31.899
Oh, I'm gonna get you!

04:32.935 --> 04:35.169
Come on, baby, go!

04:39.207 --> 04:42.142
Come on, baby, yeah!

04:42.144 --> 04:44.144
What's up, baby?

04:47.649 --> 04:49.483
Yeah!

05:12.908 --> 05:15.976
Well, we made it, brother.

05:15.978 --> 05:17.912
Welcome to paradise.

05:18.947 --> 05:20.514
Yeah.

06:05.643 --> 06:07.811
I'm karina. What's your name?

06:07.813 --> 06:09.613
Scott.

06:09.615 --> 06:11.014
He ain't interested.

06:15.087 --> 06:17.354
How about you, chulo?

06:17.356 --> 06:18.789
I'm not a cholo.

06:26.932 --> 06:29.066
Lose somebody?

06:29.068 --> 06:32.703
He's not here yet.

06:42.348 --> 06:43.947
Hey!

06:43.949 --> 06:46.950
I'm looking for a friend of mine,

06:46.952 --> 06:48.118
name of Carlos Madrigal.

06:48.120 --> 06:49.786
Said he was gonna meet me here.

06:51.356 --> 06:52.723
Carlos ain't here.

06:52.725 --> 06:54.691
But he is on his way, right?

06:54.693 --> 06:56.093
He comes and goes as he pleases.

06:56.095 --> 06:57.961
It's his place.

06:57.963 --> 06:59.363
This is his place?

07:00.833 --> 07:02.366
You gonna drink or not?

07:03.402 --> 07:04.968
Yeah. Let me get a...

07:04.970 --> 07:07.838
Tall bottle of your
best firewater, Cochise.

07:10.676 --> 07:12.109
Hey, do me a favor, all right?

07:12.111 --> 07:14.077
When Carlos shows, give me
the high sign, all right?

07:56.505 --> 07:59.005
_

08:00.139 --> 08:01.639
_

08:01.664 --> 08:04.664
_

08:04.689 --> 08:07.689
_

08:10.969 --> 08:12.703
I'm losing my mind.

08:12.705 --> 08:16.440
You're gonna lose a lot
more than that, rinche.

08:16.442 --> 08:18.208
I'm not a rinche.

08:18.210 --> 08:20.811
Oh, you will be.

08:20.813 --> 08:24.848
To beat the devil, you
got to play his game.

08:24.850 --> 08:26.850
Can you see the way?

08:26.852 --> 08:28.151
The culebras do this to you?

08:28.153 --> 08:31.822
Oh, you figured that out all by yourself?

08:31.824 --> 08:35.859
You're lucky they didn't take my tongue.

08:37.462 --> 08:38.861
How can I find them?

08:38.864 --> 08:42.765
Follow the road into town.

08:42.768 --> 08:44.935
Like the pinches culebras they are,

08:44.937 --> 08:46.903
you'll find them at the place

08:46.905 --> 08:49.072
where there are many temptations...

08:49.074 --> 08:54.244
Many... sweet temptations.

09:24.542 --> 09:26.109
Why is this here?

09:26.111 --> 09:28.311
It should have been taken hours ago.

09:28.313 --> 09:30.380
We're waiting for your approval, boss.

09:32.116 --> 09:36.787
If I asked for it, it was approved.

09:55.139 --> 09:57.808
- Yeah, baby, yeah.
- Whoo!

10:01.547 --> 10:03.847
Yeah, baby!

10:03.849 --> 10:05.949
Hey, eyes on the prize.

10:05.951 --> 10:07.150
They are.

10:07.152 --> 10:09.953
Carlos said we were
gonna meet him at a bar,

10:09.955 --> 10:11.021
not his bar.

10:11.023 --> 10:12.155
Yeah, so?

10:12.157 --> 10:14.224
So? Look at me.

10:14.226 --> 10:18.028
You do not close a deal
behind enemy lines, Richard.

10:18.030 --> 10:19.296
You do it on neutral ground.

10:19.298 --> 10:21.131
You have the bonds, right?

10:21.133 --> 10:23.567
Yeah. I got it tucked right
here in my fruit of the looms.

10:23.569 --> 10:25.135
No, they're in the R.V.

10:25.137 --> 10:28.171
Then stop your whimpering.
You control the board.

10:28.173 --> 10:29.239
Do I?

10:36.248 --> 10:39.082
Ah!

10:44.155 --> 10:48.458
Tonight, everything must be perfect.

10:56.200 --> 10:59.936
It's the Twister, boss. We got this.

10:59.938 --> 11:02.105
We always do.

11:02.107 --> 11:05.342
Tonight is not just any night.

11:05.344 --> 11:07.944
There's gonna be a war.

11:07.946 --> 11:10.247
And only the strongest survive.

11:13.317 --> 11:15.986
Are you strong?

11:15.988 --> 11:18.154
Yeah.

11:22.126 --> 11:24.427
I can't reach that busy, little bitch boy,

11:24.429 --> 11:26.162
and I got to tell you,

11:26.164 --> 11:28.231
I don't like the looks
of this place, all right?

11:28.233 --> 11:30.500
- I don't like the way it looks at me.
- What?!

11:30.502 --> 11:31.835
I don't know.

11:31.837 --> 11:33.536
I just feel like I'm coming out of my skin.

11:36.307 --> 11:39.142
Something ain't right here. I can smell it.

11:39.144 --> 11:41.878
Okay, Seth, you got to listen to yourself,

11:41.880 --> 11:44.547
'cause you're starting to
sound like the crazy brother.

12:14.645 --> 12:16.178
Not for me...

12:17.748 --> 12:18.848
And not for them.

12:18.850 --> 12:20.883
Relax, Red Ryder.

12:20.885 --> 12:22.852
These Buckaroos earned their bonus.

12:22.854 --> 12:24.954
So did you. Drink up.

12:24.956 --> 12:26.389
Dad, can we?

12:26.391 --> 12:27.790
Absolutely not.

12:27.792 --> 12:29.158
Aw, come on, pops.

12:29.160 --> 12:31.127
We're a band of brothers now.

12:31.129 --> 12:33.763
Crossed the desert. Didn't
even need Omar Sharif.

12:33.765 --> 12:35.398
As I recall,

12:35.400 --> 12:38.201
he killed a man for drinking
out of the wrong well.

12:38.226 --> 12:39.302
Yep.

12:39.303 --> 12:40.736
I love that scene.

12:40.738 --> 12:42.004
We're not your brothers.

12:42.006 --> 12:43.739
We're not your family.

12:43.741 --> 12:44.840
We're your prisoners.

12:44.842 --> 12:45.875
Dad, don't.

12:45.877 --> 12:47.910
It's all right, little lady.

12:47.912 --> 12:49.712
You see, papa bears grumble.

12:50.213 --> 12:52.014
That's what papa bears do.

12:52.016 --> 12:54.817
You think you're in control
'cause you got the keys?

12:54.819 --> 12:56.752
Think you're on top of the world.

12:56.754 --> 12:59.855
But you're not. You're on the bottom.

12:59.857 --> 13:00.990
And you're scared.

13:00.992 --> 13:03.759
And you think you're better than me?

13:03.761 --> 13:05.761
You too good to have a
drink with a common thief?

13:05.763 --> 13:07.430
Is that it?

13:07.432 --> 13:09.799
Now, like it or not,

13:09.801 --> 13:11.167
we are a family...

13:11.169 --> 13:15.171
A broken, messed up,
sad excuse for a family.

13:16.107 --> 13:17.940
But, God damn it,

13:17.942 --> 13:19.842
we got love for each other, don't we?

13:19.844 --> 13:21.210
Love and forgiveness.

13:21.212 --> 13:25.114
That's how you get through the day, right?

13:29.853 --> 13:32.021
So, here goes, sis.

13:32.023 --> 13:34.190
I left some bodies on
the ground back in Kansas.

13:34.192 --> 13:36.826
Now, no doubt they were good men and true,

13:36.828 --> 13:40.096
but they were in the wrong
place at the wrong time,

13:40.098 --> 13:42.164
and they stood between me and my freedom.

13:43.133 --> 13:45.201
So I did what I had to do.

13:45.203 --> 13:47.169
I did what anybody would do.

13:47.171 --> 13:50.039
Can you find it in your
heart to forgive me?

13:51.808 --> 13:52.808
I can't hear you.

13:52.810 --> 13:54.810
I...

13:54.812 --> 13:57.947
- Yes.
- Yes, what?

13:57.949 --> 13:59.181
I forgive you.

13:59.183 --> 14:03.018
Bingo.

14:03.020 --> 14:04.186
Good job.

14:07.090 --> 14:08.090
Now you.

14:08.092 --> 14:10.226
Now me, what?

14:10.228 --> 14:11.961
Confess.

14:11.963 --> 14:13.796
Well, I've never killed anyone.

14:13.798 --> 14:16.999
Well, you must have done
something real, real bad, right?

14:17.001 --> 14:18.501
Something real, real bad

14:18.503 --> 14:21.237
that papa bear here never, ever dreamed of,

14:21.239 --> 14:24.240
not even in his late-night cable-
TV,

14:24.242 --> 14:26.876
soft-core dreams, I bet?

14:26.878 --> 14:27.910
Hmm?

14:29.513 --> 14:30.846
I caught her once...

14:30.848 --> 14:31.947
Ah!

14:32.849 --> 14:34.984
Got to come from her.

14:36.521 --> 14:38.120
Show time. We're all waiting.

14:38.122 --> 14:39.889
What do you got?

14:41.925 --> 14:44.126
I French-kissed Kyle in
the back of the church.

14:45.530 --> 14:49.131
Whoo! Wow!

14:49.133 --> 14:51.834
Preacher's daughter playing tongue hockey

14:51.836 --> 14:53.135
in the house of the Lord.

14:55.039 --> 14:56.839
Did you get religion?

14:56.841 --> 14:57.940
Hmm?

14:57.942 --> 14:59.074
Don't answer that.

14:59.076 --> 15:01.143
We'll leave that one a secret.

15:01.145 --> 15:05.047
And what about you, angel eyes?

15:05.049 --> 15:08.050
If you were a cowboy, you'd
wear a black goddamn hat.

15:08.052 --> 15:10.853
You think you can tear
us apart? It won't work.

15:10.855 --> 15:13.355
Oh, well, that's 'cause they already
heard your confession, right, padre?

15:13.357 --> 15:15.558
They already heard the
gospel according to daddy.

15:15.560 --> 15:18.160
Tie it all up in a nice,
neat little bow for him.

15:18.162 --> 15:21.330
And lo, the marriage was
falling apart, he said.

15:21.332 --> 15:23.866
That's why he crashed the car.

15:23.868 --> 15:26.335
You don't know a thing about it.

15:26.337 --> 15:28.971
Except I never heard a why, padre.

15:28.973 --> 15:31.307
Why was mommy and daddy's
love on the rocks, huh?

15:31.309 --> 15:32.975
You better stop right there.

15:32.977 --> 15:34.944
Or what?

15:34.946 --> 15:37.079
God's judgment's gonna come down on me?

15:37.081 --> 15:39.915
That's what you were spewing
back at the motel, right?

15:42.085 --> 15:45.387
You said you had this coming.

15:49.092 --> 15:51.193
Put your glasses up.

15:51.195 --> 15:53.128
Up!

15:55.198 --> 15:57.132
Here's to the book of revelations.

16:03.207 --> 16:05.407
It's like angels pissing on my heart.

16:05.409 --> 16:06.942
So that's what that feels like.

16:06.944 --> 16:08.911
Well, I got to go see a man about a horse.

16:08.913 --> 16:11.380
Talk amongst yourselves.

16:11.382 --> 16:14.250
Share your, uh, sorrows, your joys.

16:14.252 --> 16:15.885
I don't really give a shit.

16:15.887 --> 16:19.088
Just remember, I have the keys.

16:23.226 --> 16:25.094
Go to hell.

16:30.634 --> 16:32.635
Like the pinches culebras they are,

16:32.637 --> 16:34.236
you'll find them at the place

16:34.238 --> 16:36.138
where there are many temptations...

16:36.140 --> 16:39.909
Many... sweet temptations.

16:49.987 --> 16:51.921
That guy you belted back there

16:51.923 --> 16:54.924
called you a pinche rinche.

16:54.926 --> 16:57.359
Yes, he did.

16:57.361 --> 17:00.062
I know what that means.

17:00.064 --> 17:03.933
Aren't you just a fountain of knowledge?

17:06.403 --> 17:09.405
I'd have belted him, too.

17:11.007 --> 17:13.142
I caught some static when
I first put the star on.

17:13.144 --> 17:15.176
But people like that need to know

17:15.179 --> 17:17.413
there's no rinches out there anymore...

17:17.415 --> 17:19.682
Just Rangers.

17:19.684 --> 17:21.684
You tell them.

17:21.685 --> 17:24.086
I heard all the stories.

17:24.088 --> 17:26.387
The rangers made a bad name
for themselves back then.

17:26.390 --> 17:29.024
That's why they call it the bad old days.

17:29.026 --> 17:30.426
Some Mexican would go fugitive,

17:30.428 --> 17:32.227
and the rangers would take that

17:32.229 --> 17:33.729
as an excuse to ride around,

17:33.731 --> 17:36.165
shooting other Mexicans
until they got their guy.

17:36.167 --> 17:38.968
Yeah, I knew some of them boys.

17:38.970 --> 17:40.469
Rinches.

17:40.471 --> 17:41.537
Yeah?

17:42.739 --> 17:44.306
Yeah.

17:44.308 --> 17:46.175
Most of them didn't live long enough

17:46.177 --> 17:47.977
to be put out to pasture.

17:49.279 --> 17:51.046
Some of them stuck around,

17:51.048 --> 17:52.448
changed their ways...

17:54.217 --> 17:55.384
Or didn't get caught.

17:55.386 --> 17:57.453
Like I said, that ain't now.

17:57.455 --> 17:59.722
We ain't got to shoot anybody
in the back to make a statement.

17:59.724 --> 18:01.490
You think that's all it was...

18:01.492 --> 18:03.592
A bunch of Mexicans
getting shot in the back?

18:05.195 --> 18:07.763
They'd hang them from willow
trees in the crossroads,

18:07.765 --> 18:10.199
two, three at a time, set them on fire,

18:10.201 --> 18:13.369
dare somebody to come and cut them down,

18:13.371 --> 18:15.437
teach them a lesson.

18:15.439 --> 18:17.106
What lesson?

18:20.443 --> 18:22.044
Sometimes...

18:24.147 --> 18:27.216
Even the worst kind of
brutality has its place.

18:27.218 --> 18:29.151
And what place is that?

18:31.122 --> 18:33.455
Place of dead roads.

18:33.457 --> 18:35.391
Last stop before hell.

18:37.260 --> 18:39.495
¿Señor?

18:39.497 --> 18:40.562
¿Más café?

18:42.232 --> 18:43.432
Sí.

19:14.297 --> 19:15.330
Hey!

19:44.595 --> 19:47.563
Yeah! Whoo!

19:47.565 --> 19:50.630
Check it out.

19:53.303 --> 19:54.603
When was the last time you seen me do that?

19:54.605 --> 19:56.872
Congratulations. Now come on.

19:56.874 --> 19:59.174
Seth, I ain't leaving this place.

19:59.176 --> 20:00.442
Look...

20:00.444 --> 20:02.411
That beige monster sticks out

20:02.413 --> 20:04.580
like a third tit on a stripper, okay?

20:04.582 --> 20:07.316
Not exactly the best
place to keep our money.

20:07.318 --> 20:08.384
I need you to keep watch

20:08.386 --> 20:10.252
while I stash it somewhere else.

20:10.254 --> 20:12.221
Oh, I'm sorry. That's funny?

20:12.223 --> 20:13.322
You want to fill me in on the joke?

20:13.324 --> 20:15.224
You just sat down to the table.

20:15.226 --> 20:16.658
It's a little early to fold your hand.

20:19.864 --> 20:22.464
Yes! Oh! That's right, baby.

20:22.466 --> 20:25.267
You show them why they
call you "Cannonball."

20:25.269 --> 20:27.870
I'll take a piece of that action.

20:27.872 --> 20:29.605
Step right up, slick.

20:32.375 --> 20:34.143
Hey!

20:34.145 --> 20:36.612
You kept saying somebody
was calling you here, right?

20:36.614 --> 20:38.447
What did you mean by that?

20:38.449 --> 20:40.349
Oh, now you want to know.

20:40.351 --> 20:42.618
Forget about it, Seth. You
already had your chance.

20:46.256 --> 20:48.524
Yeah! Whoo!

21:11.514 --> 21:14.950
Iwepa, wepa, wepa!

21:14.975 --> 21:16.975
You again?

21:17.520 --> 21:19.321
I didn't break your nose back there, did I?

21:19.323 --> 21:21.557
Yeah, pendejo, you did.

21:21.559 --> 21:24.593
That's terrible, 'cause if
you don't get out of my way,

21:24.595 --> 21:26.395
I'm gonna break the rest of your face, too.

21:29.400 --> 21:30.699
Sorry. Is something funny?

21:30.701 --> 21:33.302
That look on your face!

21:33.304 --> 21:34.403
This face?

21:38.608 --> 21:40.242
No.

21:40.244 --> 21:42.511
Shit!

21:42.513 --> 21:43.979
That one.

21:48.685 --> 21:49.484
Oh!

21:50.420 --> 21:51.353
Aah!

22:18.281 --> 22:20.716
¡Mátalo! Pick him up!

22:25.655 --> 22:28.423
This is what we do with pinche interlopers!

22:34.998 --> 22:37.766
He's been gone a long time.

22:37.768 --> 22:39.635
Let's just go.

22:39.637 --> 22:40.802
We could hitchhike...

22:41.671 --> 22:43.805
Pay someone to take us to the border.

22:43.807 --> 22:45.907
No, I've put you in enough
bad situations already

22:45.909 --> 22:47.709
without asking you to do something

22:47.711 --> 22:48.810
that could be much worse.

22:48.812 --> 22:50.345
We can't just stay here!

22:50.347 --> 22:52.781
I don't think we have a choice.

22:52.783 --> 22:54.283
How can you say that, dad?

22:54.285 --> 22:55.384
'Cause Seth was right.

22:55.386 --> 22:56.985
He thinks this is judgment.

22:58.621 --> 23:00.289
Is that true, dad?

23:00.291 --> 23:01.990
Is God judging us?

23:01.992 --> 23:03.492
No.

23:04.894 --> 23:06.895
I'm the only one who fell from grace.

23:06.897 --> 23:08.063
Daddy, you're scaring me.

23:08.065 --> 23:10.065
I'm not trying to frighten you.

23:11.668 --> 23:12.734
Listen to me, both of you.

23:12.736 --> 23:14.903
We have to have faith in us

23:14.905 --> 23:17.972
that we can bear this
tribulation as a family

23:17.974 --> 23:18.840
and that we might...

23:18.841 --> 23:20.341
Who are you trying to
convince, us or yourself?

23:20.411 --> 23:21.910
I'm gonna go try and find Richie.

23:21.912 --> 23:23.345
He's crazier than his brother.

23:23.347 --> 23:25.814
Well, at least he hasn't lied to us.

23:39.062 --> 23:40.329
Señor.

23:41.664 --> 23:42.531
Venga.

23:44.801 --> 23:46.401
Números.

23:47.070 --> 23:49.071
Can you get me in there?

23:49.073 --> 23:50.439
Sí.

23:52.975 --> 23:54.343
Mi dinero?

24:02.719 --> 24:04.353
Come on.

24:25.941 --> 24:29.010
Rinche, you're early to the party,

24:29.012 --> 24:31.412
and I don't remember seeing
your name on the list.

24:31.414 --> 24:33.481
But I knew you would find your way here.

24:33.483 --> 24:36.618
Shh, shh. No, no, no, no.

24:36.620 --> 24:38.286
Don't speak,

24:38.288 --> 24:41.356
'cause when you use your tongue...

24:41.358 --> 24:42.924
It's so easy to lie.

24:44.927 --> 24:47.896
You've been carrying this
for a while, haven't you?

24:47.898 --> 24:50.632
It's older than you think. Ancient bone.

24:50.634 --> 24:52.500
And the blade... Well...

24:53.269 --> 24:55.303
Obsidian.

24:55.305 --> 24:56.638
So much more than steel.

24:56.640 --> 24:58.306
It's a dark mirror.

25:01.010 --> 25:03.044
It showed you things, didn't it?

25:05.247 --> 25:07.515
I think it did.

25:07.517 --> 25:11.019
And I wonder, rinche...

25:13.623 --> 25:15.490
What have you seen?

25:22.564 --> 25:23.665
Show me.

25:28.404 --> 25:29.971
Kill these bastards.

25:46.589 --> 25:48.556
¡Felicidades!

25:48.558 --> 25:51.893
Rinche, Margaret is a beautiful woman.

25:51.895 --> 25:53.594
She is beautiful.

25:53.596 --> 25:57.498
And that baby girl... Mmm... Scrumptious.

26:03.706 --> 26:04.639
Aah!

26:07.710 --> 26:09.644
Yeah.

26:12.081 --> 26:13.614
Aah!

26:18.755 --> 26:21.422
Now, I'm gonna do something for you

26:21.424 --> 26:23.691
and give you something
that your mama never did,

26:23.693 --> 26:26.427
and that's a choice...

26:26.429 --> 26:27.729
Gutted like a puerquito

26:27.731 --> 26:31.132
or maybe just quick
surgery at the joints, huh?

26:31.134 --> 26:32.333
Aah!

26:34.404 --> 26:35.737
¿Te quieres? What you want?

26:38.707 --> 26:40.408
Oh, well.

26:40.410 --> 26:42.510
I guess it's dealer's choice!

26:44.347 --> 26:46.347
Aah!

26:49.085 --> 26:52.120
You? But... no, no.

26:52.122 --> 26:55.156
No! He broke my nose! He broke my nose.

26:55.158 --> 26:56.624
Untie him and go.

27:06.735 --> 27:11.039
You're a long way from
Kansas City, Mr. Gecko.

27:17.513 --> 27:19.480
Lost your way, little Bo-Peep?

27:19.482 --> 27:21.482
Then again, I guess there's enough sheep

27:21.484 --> 27:24.652
in this place to follow you.

27:24.654 --> 27:26.387
Wait a minute. I know you.

27:26.389 --> 27:27.455
I got to go.

27:27.457 --> 27:28.790
No, hold on a second.

27:28.792 --> 27:30.792
Your legs must be tired.

27:30.794 --> 27:33.061
You've been walking around my mind all day.

27:33.063 --> 27:34.562
Well, I'm gonna keep walking.

27:34.564 --> 27:36.130
Well, now, are you here
all by your lonesome?

27:36.132 --> 27:38.099
No, I'm not.

27:38.101 --> 27:41.402
Well, if any of these
hooligans give you a hard time,

27:41.404 --> 27:43.704
you just tell them you're with sex machine.

27:43.706 --> 27:46.140
Sex machine?

27:52.781 --> 27:55.216
I bet it shoots blanks.

28:16.238 --> 28:18.172
Who's next?

28:18.174 --> 28:20.208
You?

28:20.210 --> 28:22.710
I'm next.

28:22.712 --> 28:26.848
Hunt me down, Richard.

28:26.850 --> 28:29.650
Hunt for me.

28:38.594 --> 28:39.827
Are you her?

28:39.829 --> 28:43.331
I'm whoever you want me to be, chulo.

28:44.533 --> 28:46.801
Say my name... Richard.

28:50.873 --> 28:53.574
Richard.

28:53.576 --> 28:55.209
Say, "Set me free."

28:55.211 --> 28:59.480
Mm. Set me free.

28:59.482 --> 29:01.849
Say, "I want to drink you up."

29:05.888 --> 29:07.755
I want to drink you.

29:07.757 --> 29:09.590
Up.

29:09.592 --> 29:11.559
Something's up.

29:25.707 --> 29:28.643
That's enough. Get up.

29:32.814 --> 29:34.315
What do you want, Kate?

29:34.317 --> 29:36.284
I need your help. I need
you to get us out of here.

29:36.286 --> 29:38.653
I'm sorry. It's not up to me.

29:39.721 --> 29:42.723
Thank you for, you know,
saving my ass back there.

29:42.725 --> 29:44.258
Not a word about it.

29:47.796 --> 29:50.264
You seem to have me at a disadvantage here.

29:50.266 --> 29:52.333
I mean, you know my name,

29:52.335 --> 29:54.936
but... I don't know who I'm thanking.

29:54.938 --> 29:56.637
Call me Narciso.

29:56.639 --> 29:58.206
Okay.

29:58.208 --> 30:00.208
I have only two questions
for you, Mr. Gecko.

30:00.210 --> 30:02.210
Yeah, shoot.

30:02.212 --> 30:05.680
First, how, after avoiding
hundreds of policemen to get here,

30:05.682 --> 30:07.281
did you find yourself surrounded

30:07.283 --> 30:09.283
by those pendejos in the parking lot?

30:09.952 --> 30:13.254
Uh, well...

30:13.256 --> 30:16.224
You know, my Uncle Eddie always used to say

30:16.226 --> 30:18.559
you're never in a fight
with only one asshole.

30:18.561 --> 30:19.694
Why is that?

30:19.696 --> 30:21.596
Even assholes have friends.

30:21.598 --> 30:22.897
Hmm. Nice.

30:24.566 --> 30:25.600
To Uncle Eddie.

30:25.602 --> 30:27.235
Good, old Uncle Eddie.

30:32.708 --> 30:33.975
The second question,

30:33.977 --> 30:35.710
and perhaps the more pertinent one...

30:35.712 --> 30:38.579
- Yeah.
- Why would a man with such good sense

30:38.581 --> 30:39.847
agree to pay $10 million

30:39.849 --> 30:41.649
to a piece of shit like Carlos?

30:44.786 --> 30:46.988
No. Relax, Mr. Gecko.

30:48.624 --> 30:49.890
I make it my business to know things.

30:49.892 --> 30:51.392
Well, then, you know my deal is with him.

30:51.394 --> 30:52.927
What are you getting out of it?

30:55.330 --> 30:57.398
First-class ticket for
me and my brother...

30:58.400 --> 30:59.600
To El Rey.

30:59.602 --> 31:01.902
El...

31:04.373 --> 31:07.275
Jesus Christ. Everybody's
in on the joke tonight?

31:07.277 --> 31:10.411
He's still using that line... El Rey.

31:10.413 --> 31:12.913
It's a myth, amigo.

31:14.917 --> 31:17.418
So much for your good sense.

31:17.420 --> 31:20.788
Are you saying it's not real?

31:20.790 --> 31:23.324
I'm saying it's not for you.

31:31.634 --> 31:32.900
I want to hear you scream.

31:48.517 --> 31:50.551
I would stay and watch you get taken apart,

31:50.553 --> 31:53.754
slice by slice...

31:53.756 --> 31:55.823
But I have other plans.

31:57.359 --> 31:59.393
I know.

32:04.399 --> 32:05.866
There are nine houses.

32:05.868 --> 32:08.402
They're all coming here tonight

32:08.404 --> 32:09.537
for that snake bitch statue

32:09.539 --> 32:10.805
you have in that cheap shrine.

32:18.613 --> 32:19.714
¿Cómo?

32:19.716 --> 32:22.750
You're afraid of them all.

32:22.752 --> 32:24.452
But one in particular...

32:24.454 --> 32:26.754
He's gonna wreck everything you worked for.

32:26.756 --> 32:29.357
Didn't your piece-of-shit
knife show you that?

32:29.359 --> 32:31.459
You're not the only one who saw something.

32:31.461 --> 32:32.893
Who is it?

32:37.933 --> 32:39.934
You give me the Geckos,
I'll give you a name.

32:51.513 --> 32:52.580
Narciso.

32:57.386 --> 32:58.853
You surprised me.

33:00.689 --> 33:02.456
I don't like surprises.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.700
Tranquilo, cabrón. I'm coming.

33:12.702 --> 33:13.934
The Geckos are here.

33:13.936 --> 33:15.803
Yeah, Seth keeps calling me

33:15.805 --> 33:17.505
like a pussy-whipped gabacho.

33:17.507 --> 33:18.873
Tell me something I don't know.

33:18.875 --> 33:20.975
How about he's in the
V.I.P. booth with Narciso,

33:20.977 --> 33:22.843
talking like they're old friends.

33:34.823 --> 33:36.090
Take your time with him.

33:39.661 --> 33:41.429
Find out what else he knows.

33:41.431 --> 33:43.898
You want us to save you a piece, jefe?

33:43.900 --> 33:45.900
The tongue.

33:48.703 --> 33:49.937
You don't need us.

33:49.939 --> 33:51.906
You're here to make some stupid deal.

33:51.908 --> 33:54.041
- It's Seth's deal.
- So, then, let us go.

33:54.043 --> 33:56.744
I mean, all you have to do
is get the keys from him.

33:58.447 --> 33:59.580
Richie...

33:59.582 --> 34:01.048
I don't want you to leave.

34:01.050 --> 34:03.751
I want you to see this
place for what it really is.

34:03.753 --> 34:05.653
I want you to feel what I'm feeling.

34:06.555 --> 34:07.988
You said that you were lost.

34:07.990 --> 34:09.523
I was alone, too,

34:09.525 --> 34:11.659
and when I had nothing left, she found me.

34:11.661 --> 34:14.728
She called to me, and she led me here.

34:14.730 --> 34:16.597
You said that your life was upside down.

34:16.599 --> 34:18.933
Well, maybe this is where
you're really supposed to be.

34:18.935 --> 34:20.134
But...

34:22.471 --> 34:24.737
How could I belong here?

34:24.739 --> 34:25.873
I mean, look at this place.

34:25.875 --> 34:27.507
You're not looking close enough.

34:27.510 --> 34:30.610
Under the surface, it's really beautiful.

34:33.581 --> 34:35.014
I don't see it.

34:35.016 --> 34:38.085
It's because you aren't
looking close enough.

34:40.755 --> 34:43.056
- What does it feel like?
- What does what feel like?

34:43.059 --> 34:45.693
To know that you...

34:45.695 --> 34:48.596
To know that you belong, really?

34:49.764 --> 34:51.599
It feels like home.

34:53.835 --> 34:55.101
Please.

34:57.873 --> 34:59.840
Please let us go.

35:00.876 --> 35:02.710
Just let us go.

35:06.681 --> 35:08.716
Set me free.

35:10.719 --> 35:11.986
Why did you say that?

35:21.663 --> 35:22.863
Oh, my God.

35:25.834 --> 35:27.835
Preacher's daughter strikes again.

35:28.136 --> 35:29.937
Kate?

35:29.939 --> 35:32.540
- This is what you've been doing?
- Kate?

35:32.542 --> 35:34.942
Playing "You show me yours,
I'll show you mine," huh?

35:34.944 --> 35:36.677
Kate?

35:36.679 --> 35:38.078
Richie, will you listen to me, God damn it?

35:38.080 --> 35:39.780
Don't even start. I'm not leaving.

35:39.782 --> 35:41.549
Yeah, look, I'm sure
there's another titty bar

35:41.551 --> 35:42.917
somewhere else in this
goddamn country, all right?

35:42.919 --> 35:44.818
I'll get you a V.I.P.
card and a couple of girls

35:44.820 --> 35:46.754
just shy of their quinceañera.

35:47.722 --> 35:49.089
I'm your goddamn brother, and you treat me

35:49.091 --> 35:50.758
like I'm the ugly stepkid in the attic.

35:50.760 --> 35:52.092
If I say we stay, we stay, and that's it.

35:52.094 --> 35:54.895
Why don't we throw for it?

35:56.131 --> 35:58.032
What?

35:58.034 --> 36:02.736
Let the knives decide like old times, yeah?

36:02.738 --> 36:04.605
I win, we walk.

36:04.607 --> 36:06.774
You win, we stay.

36:16.085 --> 36:17.751
I'm sorry, Margaret.

36:22.958 --> 36:26.093
Sorry, Earl.

36:26.095 --> 36:28.028
I tried, God damn it. I tried.

36:28.030 --> 36:30.164
Yeah, cállate, pinche rinche.

36:30.166 --> 36:32.933
Sometimes...

36:32.935 --> 36:36.003
Even the worst kind of
brutality has its place.

36:36.005 --> 36:37.705
And what place is that?

36:37.707 --> 36:39.907
Place of dead roads.

36:39.909 --> 36:41.942
Last stop before hell.

37:22.050 --> 37:23.951
Works better if he's wet.

37:45.807 --> 37:48.776
There's gonna be a war.

37:50.145 --> 37:51.812
Only the strong survive.

37:55.684 --> 37:56.850
Are you strong?

37:57.694 --> 37:59.694
_

38:18.139 --> 38:21.008
You will never, ever touch my family!

38:21.010 --> 38:24.378
Do you know who I am? I'm the rinche.

38:57.812 --> 38:58.912
Hey.

38:58.914 --> 39:00.314
Come here!

39:05.754 --> 39:07.054
You tricked me.

39:08.056 --> 39:09.823
You want to make it up to me?

39:09.825 --> 39:12.292
Yes. Sí, sir.

39:12.294 --> 39:14.027
I bet you know where Carlos is.

39:16.131 --> 39:18.999
His club.

39:56.604 --> 39:58.105
I don't see her.

40:00.408 --> 40:03.377
She wouldn't leave without us.

40:03.379 --> 40:05.012
That's enough.

40:07.682 --> 40:09.116
Listen to me.

40:09.118 --> 40:12.552
This whole day has been a horrible mistake.

40:12.554 --> 40:13.754
We've been on edge

40:13.756 --> 40:16.656
since we've come across those bastards.

40:16.658 --> 40:19.159
And because we're all still reeling
from the loss of your mother,

40:19.161 --> 40:22.729
I said it was judgment, but I was wrong.

40:22.731 --> 40:25.732
It's just bad luck.

40:25.734 --> 40:27.567
All this talk about judgment...

40:27.569 --> 40:28.735
Don't you pay it no mind.

40:28.737 --> 40:31.371
But it is true.

40:31.373 --> 40:33.040
The border-patrol agent told me as much.

40:33.042 --> 40:34.174
What are you talking about?

40:34.176 --> 40:36.710
He knew things about us, about me.

40:38.112 --> 40:41.415
Dad, I don't think today is a mistake.

40:41.417 --> 40:43.683
I think it's all happening for a reason.

40:46.788 --> 40:48.121
Get up.

40:49.791 --> 40:51.792
What? Why?

40:51.794 --> 40:53.593
'Cause I'm gonna get us out of here.

40:58.767 --> 41:00.500
Could... could I help you, friend?

41:00.502 --> 41:02.135
Are you heading out?

41:02.137 --> 41:03.770
Yes, sir.

41:03.772 --> 41:06.807
Just rolled my last number for the road.

41:06.809 --> 41:08.141
This really ain't my scene.

41:08.143 --> 41:10.410
Yeah, I hear you on that.

41:10.412 --> 41:12.112
It's lonely at night.

41:12.114 --> 41:15.148
I spied that... that fire.

41:15.150 --> 41:17.417
It's like a beacon.

41:17.419 --> 41:20.520
So I pull over, holed up for a while.

41:20.522 --> 41:24.591
But I guess it's time for me to go.

41:24.593 --> 41:27.193
Well, sir, could... could I impose on you

41:27.195 --> 41:28.461
for a lift back to Texas?

41:28.463 --> 41:29.996
I can pay you.

41:32.567 --> 41:35.135
Listen, friend...

41:35.137 --> 41:38.705
I'd be willing to give you a lift,

41:38.707 --> 41:41.608
if you'd be willing to share.

41:45.713 --> 41:46.880
We got a deal?

41:46.882 --> 41:48.315
That's my son.

41:51.119 --> 41:52.519
I like them young, too.

41:57.658 --> 41:58.859
Dad.

42:22.583 --> 42:23.750
What's going on out there?

42:23.752 --> 42:25.752
He's not with Narciso anymore,

42:25.754 --> 42:27.754
if that's what you're asking.

42:27.756 --> 42:29.489
He and the brother are throwing knives.

42:29.491 --> 42:32.759
Good, 'cause we're about to start.

42:32.761 --> 42:37.564
Make sure that everything
and everyone is ready,

42:37.566 --> 42:40.167
and return this to its rightful owner.

42:57.317 --> 42:58.685
Ow!

43:01.822 --> 43:03.890
Real smooth, Richard.

43:06.827 --> 43:08.261
Okay.

43:14.302 --> 43:16.202
Your move, brother.

43:16.204 --> 43:17.837
Why don't we make it interesting?

43:21.742 --> 43:23.376
What are you doing?

43:24.344 --> 43:26.112
Richie wins,

43:26.114 --> 43:28.047
you give me the keys and let us go.

43:28.049 --> 43:29.415
And if he loses?

43:29.417 --> 43:32.051
Well, then, I guess I'm
stuck here, literally.

43:32.053 --> 43:33.319
No way. I'm not doing this.

43:33.321 --> 43:34.721
Well, you don't really have a choice.

43:34.723 --> 43:36.422
It's her eyeball.

43:41.261 --> 43:43.730
You need to try this one.

43:52.306 --> 43:53.473
Thank you.

43:54.875 --> 43:56.342
Where did you get that?

43:56.344 --> 43:57.510
- He just gave it to me.
- No, the... the first time.

43:57.512 --> 43:58.878
Where did you get it the first time?

43:58.880 --> 44:00.213
I told you. I won it in a contest.

44:00.215 --> 44:01.814
- From who?
- Don't worry about it, bro,

44:01.816 --> 44:03.282
'cause you're about to go down.

44:30.210 --> 44:32.178
Keys.

44:33.480 --> 44:37.283
You need to sit down... now.

44:46.226 --> 44:48.027
Richie, answer the question.

44:48.029 --> 44:49.395
Who gave you the knife?

44:49.397 --> 44:50.729
What does it matter? It was some guy.

44:50.731 --> 44:51.764
Yeah, who?

44:58.872 --> 45:02.341
Ladies and gentlemen, the time has come.

45:02.343 --> 45:05.444
Please take your seats.

45:05.446 --> 45:09.816
Welcome to the Titty Twister.

45:09.818 --> 45:14.487
We have a special
performance, for tonight...

45:14.489 --> 45:18.825
Is a very, very special night.

45:21.428 --> 45:22.361
That's him.

45:22.363 --> 45:24.263
Please welcome...

45:24.265 --> 45:25.898
The mistress of the macabre...

45:25.900 --> 45:26.734
What?

45:26.759 --> 45:28.335
That's him. That's the guy
who gave me the knife.

45:28.336 --> 45:31.938
The queen of the night...

45:33.440 --> 45:36.175
Santanico Pandemonium.

46:02.202 --> 46:05.004
She's real.

46:06.607 --> 46:08.574
She's real.
