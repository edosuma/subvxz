00:20.896 --> 00:23.104
Please stop crying, Lucy.

00:26.151 --> 00:27.141
Please.

01:35.429 --> 01:36.920
Hey.

01:59.077 --> 02:02.070
I love you. Come on.

02:17.638 --> 02:20.255
I still... I have to get back to work,
I'll get in trouble.

02:20.349 --> 02:22.511
You understand, right?

02:22.601 --> 02:24.513
- Yeah.
- Okay.

02:24.603 --> 02:25.684
Come on.

02:27.731 --> 02:30.269
I'll come to you right after work.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.655
Hey!

02:37.741 --> 02:39.528
I love you.

03:30.127 --> 03:33.541
- Hello.
- Hey.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.121
I didn't think you were
gonna be home for dinner.

03:35.215 --> 03:38.208
Oh, I had a big lunch.
I just came from the gym.

03:40.512 --> 03:41.753
How was work?

03:41.847 --> 03:44.760
Yeah, right.

03:44.850 --> 03:48.218
- You?
- Uh, same.

03:48.311 --> 03:50.223
Did you get that message from Joel?

03:52.482 --> 03:53.939
No, what's that?

03:54.025 --> 03:56.563
He's coming home.

04:07.789 --> 04:09.781
We're almost out of toothpaste.

04:11.460 --> 04:12.701
Oh?

04:15.797 --> 04:18.380
I'll make sure to pick up some tomorrow

04:18.466 --> 04:21.005
on the way back from work.

04:26.224 --> 04:29.717
Actually, I'm getting drinks
with Ben after work tomorrow.

04:47.913 --> 04:50.326
- How is he?
- Who?

04:51.541 --> 04:54.625
Ben. You said you're having drinks with him.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.498
Oh, I think fine.

04:59.883 --> 05:03.251
I hope so, anyway.
Poor guy's had a tough year.

05:03.345 --> 05:05.007
Be good to see him.

05:08.183 --> 05:11.142
So... Joel's coming.

05:11.228 --> 05:14.687
Yeah. With his girlfriend.

05:14.773 --> 05:17.516
- Oh, yeah?
- Yep.

05:18.527 --> 05:20.519
That should be nice.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.691
Yes.

05:24.699 --> 05:27.533
- Good night, honey.
- Good night.

05:34.918 --> 05:37.080
<i>What does that mean? For us?</i>

05:37.170 --> 05:40.004
It means we have a date.

05:40.090 --> 05:42.207
Right after my son leaves.

05:44.344 --> 05:47.132
It would be a disaster before.

05:55.689 --> 05:57.521
You need to tell her now,

05:57.607 --> 06:01.521
and then you discuss it with your son
when he gets here.

06:01.611 --> 06:02.852
<i>That</i> makes sense.

06:02.946 --> 06:06.235
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.
You don't know him.

06:06.324 --> 06:10.659
It will be a living hell for his whole visit.

06:10.745 --> 06:13.704
There's no reason to make it dramatic.

06:13.790 --> 06:15.873
- Dramatic?
- I'm sorry.

06:15.959 --> 06:18.372
Lucy, please don't. This is good news.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.623
This is great news. Think about it.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.957
We have a date, a real one.

06:24.050 --> 06:27.634
And all this business
will be over soon, finally.

06:27.721 --> 06:28.928
Dramatic?

06:29.014 --> 06:31.677
God damn it, I used the wrong word!
I didn't mean...

06:31.766 --> 06:36.184
You know, it's impossible to discuss anything
with you if you get upset so quickly.

06:36.271 --> 06:37.933
- Fuck you! Fuck you, Michael!
- Lucy, stop!

06:38.023 --> 06:39.355
Come on, Lucy, where are you...

06:39.441 --> 06:41.854
- Dramatic enough?
- Where are you going?

06:41.943 --> 06:45.061
Come back. God damn it!

06:45.155 --> 06:46.612
Lucy, I'm an idiot!

06:46.698 --> 06:48.781
Everybody knows I'm an idiot, all right?

06:48.867 --> 06:51.280
Come back, I'm a moron.

06:51.369 --> 06:54.703
Lucy, I apologize! I didn't mean "dramatic."

06:56.541 --> 07:00.160
You're a coward, Michael.
You need to tell her now.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.495
All right. All right, yes, you're right.

07:02.589 --> 07:05.127
- Can we just discuss it?
- Tell her!

07:41.294 --> 07:42.455
Hey.

07:43.505 --> 07:47.124
- Lunch?
- I can't.

07:47.217 --> 07:52.212
- I have a potential client.
- Oh, that's too bad.

07:52.305 --> 07:55.048
I appreciate that, Sue. How about tomorrow?

07:55.141 --> 07:57.633
- Sure, sounds great.
- Okay.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.019
Good luck.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.105
With the client.

08:05.402 --> 08:06.563
Right.

08:14.411 --> 08:17.028
It's great news.

08:17.122 --> 08:19.830
It's wonderful news.

08:19.916 --> 08:21.373
Is it?

08:21.459 --> 08:25.954
It means we actually
have a date, a real date.

08:47.819 --> 08:49.355
Robert.

08:51.072 --> 08:52.313
Come...

09:02.792 --> 09:04.408
I feel like I can't do anything anymore.

09:08.214 --> 09:09.455
Can't write.

09:11.301 --> 09:13.133
Can't think.

09:13.219 --> 09:14.960
Can't eat.

09:17.557 --> 09:18.968
Can't sleep.

09:22.145 --> 09:23.727
Can't even fucking smoke.

09:40.747 --> 09:44.577
You got to tell me that this is true, that
this is it for real this time, because...

09:49.297 --> 09:51.835
You know, I can't take it otherwise,
I really can't.

10:04.187 --> 10:07.897
Come on. It's true, I promise.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.810
I'm gonna tell him, promise.

10:14.656 --> 10:16.613
Soon, so soon.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.616
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

10:39.389 --> 10:41.301
Hey, Ben.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.633
Glad I got you! It's me, Michael.

10:47.147 --> 10:50.060
Yeah, it <i>has</i> been awhile,
that's why I'm calling.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.187
Be good to catch up. Uh...

10:52.277 --> 10:55.361
How about you and me go
and grab some beers, now?

10:56.698 --> 10:58.314
Yeah, <i>now,</i> now.

11:00.368 --> 11:02.325
I can come to you.

11:02.412 --> 11:06.156
I can drive to wherever you are.
I can be there in 20 minutes.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.660
Oh, yeah, no, no, I understand.

11:12.714 --> 11:14.250
Of course.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.634
Of course. Next week, let's do it.

11:19.971 --> 11:21.758
You sound well.

11:21.848 --> 11:25.182
All right. Looking forward to it.

11:25.268 --> 11:27.351
Talk soon. Okay, bye.

11:58.218 --> 12:02.713
Hi, Lucy! I was just about to call you.

12:02.805 --> 12:05.422
Oh, just to say hi, and, uh...

12:06.559 --> 12:08.642
tell you I'm thinking about you, and, uh...

12:08.728 --> 12:12.312
and to say I'm sorry about earlier.
I-I-I was being insensitive.

12:16.778 --> 12:20.317
I would love to, but I can't.
I'm just about to meet my buddy, Ben.

12:20.406 --> 12:24.025
He's been after me for a while
to meet him for drinks

12:24.118 --> 12:27.407
and, uh, I-I kept pushing him off.

12:27.497 --> 12:30.740
I don't know, I guess
he's going through a bad time.

12:34.045 --> 12:36.128
I don't know. I don't know.

12:36.214 --> 12:41.216
Why don't we just play it by ear, and I'll
text you or something when I get out?

12:41.302 --> 12:44.261
I don't know how long we're gonna be.

12:45.974 --> 12:47.715
That... that would be lovely.

12:50.687 --> 12:52.144
Yes, my dear.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.181
I will.

12:59.779 --> 13:00.769
Yeah.

13:03.950 --> 13:06.237
I will... Hey! Hey, Ben!

13:06.327 --> 13:09.035
Hold on, hon. Hey, Ben!

13:09.122 --> 13:12.035
I'm sorry, he's here, I just saw him.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.162
Hey, Ben, good to see you, man.

13:14.252 --> 13:18.462
Let me just find a place to park.
I think I see a space right over here.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.005
Okay?

13:20.091 --> 13:22.378
All right, I'll be with you, just one minute.

13:22.468 --> 13:25.552
Honey, I really have to go now.
Why don't I just call you later?

13:25.638 --> 13:29.052
I love you so much. I love you so much.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.179
Okay, bye.

13:34.564 --> 13:37.022
<i>Gladys Perkins has an idea.</i>

13:37.108 --> 13:38.940
<i>I think she must've gone mad.</i>

13:39.027 --> 13:40.393
<i>She... she...</i>

13:42.030 --> 13:43.441
Hello.

13:43.531 --> 13:45.147
- <i>She wants to live with you.</i>
- Hey.

13:45.241 --> 13:48.860
<i>I'm just flinging myself at your head.</i>

13:48.953 --> 13:53.163
<i>I've got a crazy idea that might...</i>

13:53.249 --> 13:56.287
I thought you were going for drinks?

13:56.377 --> 13:58.664
Yeah, no.

13:58.755 --> 14:02.248
- <i>Do you think I'm mad?</i>
- <i>Quite mad, my darling.</i>

14:02.342 --> 14:05.710
I was supposed to, but I just...

14:05.803 --> 14:08.216
I couldn't pull it off.

14:08.306 --> 14:09.922
Work today...

14:14.312 --> 14:16.053
...wiped me out.

14:16.147 --> 14:17.854
<i>That's what I say, Perkins darling.</i>

14:17.940 --> 14:19.306
Mm.

14:20.318 --> 14:23.026
<i>But I've got a better idea than yours.
An improvement on it.</i>

14:23.112 --> 14:26.651
The thought of drinks, with Ben's problems?

14:26.741 --> 14:30.860
<i>No, I won't tell you here.
There's magic here.</i>

14:30.953 --> 14:35.288
<i>I'll tell you later on in the house,
perhaps even in the cold light of morning.</i>

14:35.375 --> 14:37.207
<i>Tell me now.</i>

14:38.211 --> 14:42.546
<i>No! No, let's stay here.</i>

14:42.632 --> 14:43.964
<i>You're cold.</i>

14:44.050 --> 14:47.669
- What about you?
- Me?

14:47.762 --> 14:50.220
Yeah, I...

14:50.306 --> 14:54.971
I figured you were
at the gym or working late.

14:55.061 --> 14:57.974
Oh, I had the same day as you.

14:58.064 --> 15:00.772
Just couldn't deal. Hence.

15:00.858 --> 15:01.939
Right.

15:04.779 --> 15:07.237
<i>No, you can't put on those wet shoes.</i>

15:07.323 --> 15:10.066
- <i>I'm going to try to carry you.</i>
- <i>I'm a devil of a weight.</i>

15:10.159 --> 15:12.526
<i>Well, if you're too heavy for me,
I shall drop you in the mud.</i>

15:12.620 --> 15:15.158
Um...

15:21.337 --> 15:23.875
Do you want some?

15:33.474 --> 15:34.806
Okay.

16:20.897 --> 16:22.684
Thanks.

16:36.913 --> 16:38.950
- <i>Has he got any money?</i>
- <i>Not a penny.</i>

16:39.040 --> 16:42.909
- <i>But you're going out with him.</i>
- <i>Yes, Bill. Are you angry?</i>

16:43.002 --> 16:46.586
<i>I think he's a lunatic, but I'm not angry.</i>

16:47.590 --> 16:50.082
<i>Hey, buddy, can't talk long.
I'm late for work.</i>

16:51.135 --> 16:55.254
Very excited to be seeing you soon, though.

16:55.348 --> 16:58.466
Hey, hey, that's no way
to talk to me, I'm being nice.

17:00.895 --> 17:03.308
No, I'm just...

17:03.397 --> 17:04.979
I'm just late.

17:05.066 --> 17:08.230
I don't wanna be any more late.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.402
Oh, god damn it!

17:10.488 --> 17:12.150
No, not you, I just...

17:12.240 --> 17:15.608
Okay. I'm here, okay.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.909
What's up? How can I help you?

17:20.915 --> 17:23.623
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.952
That's a question for your mother.
I don't wanna get in the middle of that.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.036
Mary!

17:29.257 --> 17:30.964
Mary.

17:31.050 --> 17:34.543
Your son is on the phone,
he has a question for you.

17:34.637 --> 17:37.345
What? Can't you handle it?
I'm trying to get ready.

17:37.431 --> 17:39.764
I'm late already.

17:39.850 --> 17:41.466
It's something about his girlfriend.

17:41.561 --> 17:43.723
I don't understand what he's talking about.

17:43.813 --> 17:46.851
- Fine, have him call me.
- Thank you.

17:46.941 --> 17:50.400
Okay, your mom says
you can call her on her phone.

17:52.822 --> 17:56.532
Yeah, and you can talk to her
about whatever directly.

17:58.286 --> 17:59.618
I'm sorry.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.530
Yes, I'm sorry, Joel.

18:05.668 --> 18:06.784
Right.

18:08.170 --> 18:09.752
I really need to go.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.131
I'm sorry.

18:16.429 --> 18:17.545
I'm sorry.

18:25.271 --> 18:27.183
Hey, it's me. Where are you?

18:28.816 --> 18:31.524
All right, I'm on my way to work, uh...

18:33.195 --> 18:35.733
Call me when you get this, please.

18:46.542 --> 18:50.001
I know, I know, I'm sorry I'm late.

18:50.087 --> 18:52.625
No excuses.

19:41.764 --> 19:43.221
They started ten minutes ago.

19:43.307 --> 19:45.048
- They're waiting for you.
- I know, I know.

19:45.142 --> 19:46.599
I'll just be a minute, I'll come right in.

19:46.686 --> 19:49.929
Thanks. I appreciate it.

19:51.065 --> 19:52.397
Appreciate it.

20:23.305 --> 20:26.264
<i>And if not, they'll still be able to use</i>

20:26.350 --> 20:28.182
<i>all the systems they normally would,</i>

20:28.269 --> 20:32.104
<i>but only with other regions
that have also not adopted.</i>

20:32.189 --> 20:34.852
<i>Accordingly, the regions
involved in phase two</i>

20:34.942 --> 20:39.778
<i>should be able to interact fully
amongst each other as soon as that...</i>

20:39.864 --> 20:43.483
<i>And Mary was gonna put
together a list of the functionalities</i>

20:43.576 --> 20:47.069
<i>that we can expect to be fully operational
throughout the day.</i>

20:47.163 --> 20:50.031
<i>Uh, Mary, do you have that list?</i>

20:50.124 --> 20:52.662
Yes, uh, I'm here. Sorry, one sec.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.459
Let me just get the folder.

21:33.751 --> 21:34.992
Hello?

21:47.181 --> 21:48.422
Hello?

21:55.856 --> 21:57.142
Hello?

22:02.988 --> 22:05.571
What's up?

22:08.327 --> 22:11.161
I called earlier.

22:13.499 --> 22:16.207
Are you not talking to me now?

22:22.383 --> 22:24.340
Busy on the computer?

22:26.887 --> 22:29.425
Getting lots of emails?

22:32.977 --> 22:36.470
Okay. Okay, okay.

22:36.564 --> 22:40.103
Could you just tell me
what's going on, please?

22:46.031 --> 22:47.363
What happened last night?

22:48.367 --> 22:50.905
I went out for drinks with Ben, like I said.

22:54.540 --> 22:56.827
What? Just say it.

23:00.087 --> 23:01.999
I don't know.

23:08.596 --> 23:11.134
You don't know, Lucy? What don't you know?

23:11.223 --> 23:12.885
You said you'd call after and you didn't.

23:12.975 --> 23:14.682
I don't know what you're doing, Michael.

23:14.768 --> 23:16.475
I said I <i>may</i> call.

23:16.562 --> 23:20.101
<i>May,</i> but then it got late, and I didn't.

23:22.109 --> 23:25.443
But I've been calling all day today.

23:26.530 --> 23:29.773
And you haven't been picking up, because why?

23:34.079 --> 23:36.071
Lucy, this is...

23:55.392 --> 23:57.008
Where are you going?

23:57.102 --> 23:59.344
I don't know. To bed.

23:59.438 --> 24:02.772
- I'm tired.
- Don't, I'm sorry.

24:02.858 --> 24:05.771
It's okay. It's fine.

24:05.861 --> 24:10.026
Let's just... start over tomorrow.

24:10.115 --> 24:12.357
Michael.

24:30.094 --> 24:33.007
I wanted to say sorry, so I'm sorry.

24:33.097 --> 24:34.884
Come on, what have you got to be sorry about?

24:34.974 --> 24:39.594
Oh, 'cause, it's taken us
so long to get to this point, and...

24:39.687 --> 24:43.180
I don't know, it should've happened sooner?

24:43.273 --> 24:45.105
But... we're here now.

24:45.192 --> 24:47.149
I wanted to celebrate with you.

24:47.236 --> 24:48.898
Okay, well.

24:50.197 --> 24:51.654
Let's celebrate.

25:13.012 --> 25:14.253
Whoa...

25:16.849 --> 25:19.557
- To us.
- To us.

28:09.563 --> 28:12.601
- What time is it?
- I think it's late.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.557
Can't be late again, two days in a row.

28:14.651 --> 28:17.314
Me, too.

28:17.404 --> 28:19.896
- I'll get the coffee made.
- Great, great, thank you.

28:19.990 --> 28:22.107
I'm gonna... I'm gonna...
I'm gonna get in the shower.

28:22.201 --> 28:23.692
That sounds good.

28:29.917 --> 28:31.328
What the fuck.

29:05.827 --> 29:08.035
Oh, hey.

29:08.121 --> 29:10.659
I'll be out of here in a few minutes.

29:13.418 --> 29:15.501
Yeah, okay. No problem.

33:51.655 --> 33:55.649
And one, and two,

33:55.742 --> 33:57.608
and three, straight,

33:57.702 --> 34:01.286
and four, and flows.

34:02.290 --> 34:05.783
<i>Coupe,</i> attitude,

34:05.877 --> 34:09.791
side, close in back.

34:09.880 --> 34:14.672
<i>Coupe,</i> back, side,

34:14.761 --> 34:16.467
but close behind in fifth.

34:18.473 --> 34:23.092
And back, one, and two,

34:23.186 --> 34:26.020
and keep going.

34:26.106 --> 34:29.315
And when you're done, follow her.

34:29.400 --> 34:32.188
Make sure, <i>relevé,</i> turn around.

34:32.279 --> 34:33.520
Don't forget the <i>port de bras.</i>

34:33.612 --> 34:35.696
If I'm not back, keep going.

34:38.659 --> 34:40.743
What are you doing here?

34:40.829 --> 34:42.411
I missed you.

34:42.496 --> 34:44.989
I wanted to see you. Is that okay?

34:48.587 --> 34:50.748
Of course it's okay, silly.

34:55.092 --> 34:56.755
It's just such a surprise.

34:56.844 --> 35:00.213
I wasn't expecting you,
and I stink, I'm sorry.

35:00.307 --> 35:03.050
No, you don't. You never smell bad.

35:04.811 --> 35:06.677
Such a liar.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.313
Come here.

35:15.864 --> 35:18.402
Studio.

35:21.286 --> 35:23.118
- Can you wait 15 minutes?
- Yeah.

35:23.204 --> 35:24.991
- I'll be done then.
- Okay.

35:25.081 --> 35:28.791
- Then I'll take the quickest shower ever.
- Okay, sure.

35:28.877 --> 35:30.709
Or don't, you don't have to shower for me.

35:30.795 --> 35:32.331
You're a weirdo.

35:32.422 --> 35:34.664
- Yeah, a little bit.
- My weirdo.

35:34.758 --> 35:36.374
- Right.
- I'll be right back.

35:36.468 --> 35:37.458
- Okay.
- Okay.

35:37.552 --> 35:40.716
Okay, where are you?

35:40.805 --> 35:44.048
<i>Relevé,</i> up.

35:44.142 --> 35:46.976
Eyes front. Turn.

35:49.981 --> 35:52.519
And kick... up.

36:00.408 --> 36:02.946
Go ahead and stretch.

36:52.585 --> 36:55.919
One, two...

36:56.005 --> 37:01.376
...three, four, five, six,

37:01.469 --> 37:04.587
seven, eight.

37:25.160 --> 37:27.618
My son.

37:27.704 --> 37:29.286
Funny guy.

37:57.859 --> 38:01.443
You just look fucking beautiful.

38:06.159 --> 38:07.491
Tell me again?

38:08.495 --> 38:12.034
You don't have to do that,
you can do first. Ready?

38:12.123 --> 38:16.493
- Studio, this is Sabrina.
- And one and close.

38:16.586 --> 38:18.623
- Hi, Mrs. Nomad.
- And two, and...

38:18.713 --> 38:20.329
- So, we're doing...
- That's great, yes.

38:20.423 --> 38:23.166
- It's this coming Saturday.
- Hold on. Start over.

38:23.259 --> 38:25.046
Well, show me how to do
the spinny one you do.

38:25.136 --> 38:27.753
- The twirly one.
- You mean...

38:27.847 --> 38:30.635
- Yeah, no, fancier than that.
- That was a bad one.

38:30.725 --> 38:32.717
- So, you mean...
- It was fancier than that.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.768
Do you mean this one?

38:34.854 --> 38:37.312
That's beautiful, but it's...

38:37.398 --> 38:39.310
- You know what I'm talking about.
- Oh, I know what you mean.

38:43.363 --> 38:45.355
I got that.

38:45.448 --> 38:46.564
I got that.

38:46.658 --> 38:48.149
- Yes!
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

38:48.243 --> 38:51.236
- Oh, I love it when you're like this.
- Like what?

38:51.329 --> 38:54.163
I don't know, you're just light and cheerful,

38:54.249 --> 38:59.461
and you're in a good mood
and you're just nice.

38:59.546 --> 39:01.037
Forget it.

39:01.130 --> 39:04.714
I don't wanna forget it. I'm happy.

39:04.801 --> 39:06.042
You're happy.

39:13.476 --> 39:14.466
Hey.

39:17.272 --> 39:19.889
- Let's do something.
- We're about to.

39:19.983 --> 39:21.690
First, I'm gonna do you
and then you're gonna do me.

39:21.776 --> 39:25.770
No, let's do something
we've never done before.

39:25.864 --> 39:30.074
Let's do something normal,
like go to the mall or go see a movie.

39:30.159 --> 39:33.152
Something "date-y."

39:33.246 --> 39:34.987
Then we can do each other.

39:37.208 --> 39:40.042
- Okay.
- Yeah?

39:41.296 --> 39:42.662
Yeah.

39:42.755 --> 39:46.840
If you're okay with it, I'm okay with it.

39:47.927 --> 39:50.385
<i>Poor Henry, let me hold your hand.</i>

39:50.471 --> 39:52.633
<i>It's not heavy, I can manage.</i>
<i>Hold your own hand.</i>

39:52.724 --> 39:56.718
<i>Oh, Henry, when I do
hold your hand like this,</i>

39:56.811 --> 40:00.680
<i>and put my arm around you
and snuggle up to you like that,</i>

40:00.773 --> 40:04.266
- <i>doesn't it suggest anything to you?</i>
- <i>Yes, it does,</i>

40:04.360 --> 40:08.104
<i>but with my health,
I better not think about it!</i>

40:08.197 --> 40:11.065
<i>I think...</i>

40:11.159 --> 40:14.698
Does she think you're on a trip?

40:14.787 --> 40:18.576
I don't know. No. I didn't tell her anything.

40:18.666 --> 40:21.283
It doesn't matter, does it? Really?

40:25.924 --> 40:28.541
Okay. Uh, let's see.

40:32.221 --> 40:35.555
I'll just say I'm working late.

40:35.642 --> 40:39.135
She <i>really</i> doesn't care, trust me.

40:40.355 --> 40:43.268
I just get so tired of all the bullshit.

40:45.318 --> 40:47.605
Almost over.

40:47.695 --> 40:53.111
So why not make it the least
dramatic possible, right?

40:56.371 --> 41:00.991
- Okay. Just give me a moment.
- Okay.

41:17.100 --> 41:19.683
Go on, just where you roll it, roll it.

41:19.769 --> 41:20.759
Oh, come on.

41:20.853 --> 41:23.311
- It's too big, I might miss.
- You're not.

41:24.315 --> 41:25.601
You just slide it.

41:27.819 --> 41:30.357
Just a second, I'll be...

41:39.706 --> 41:41.197
Hello?

41:43.042 --> 41:47.878
Uh, sorry, just calling to say
I'm stuck working late tonight.

41:48.965 --> 41:51.582
Uh, just, uh, grabbing some dinner

41:51.676 --> 41:55.215
and... I'll head straight back.

41:55.304 --> 41:58.593
Uh... may have to work through the night.

41:59.600 --> 42:01.341
Wanted you to know.

42:04.897 --> 42:07.935
Okay. That sounds good.

42:14.240 --> 42:18.234
I thought you were at home. Where are you?

42:22.707 --> 42:25.245
Where am I?

42:26.502 --> 42:29.836
Uh, I had to work late, too.

42:29.922 --> 42:34.542
I just stepped out
for a bite as well, actually.

42:34.635 --> 42:38.049
Um, at the Chinese restaurant.

42:40.099 --> 42:43.592
What about you? What are you eating?

42:49.400 --> 42:53.440
I'm getting Chinese, too, funny enough.

42:53.529 --> 42:57.569
I, uh... like the duck.

42:59.535 --> 43:01.447
You should order the duck, too.

43:05.333 --> 43:06.574
Oh, yeah?

43:08.503 --> 43:11.416
I should, should I?
What if I don't like duck?

43:13.424 --> 43:15.962
Oh, it's always good, is it?

43:16.052 --> 43:19.295
- I don't know.
- Psst.

43:21.182 --> 43:22.218
Psst!

43:30.316 --> 43:35.232
<i>I'm thinking about bringing this duck home
and sharing it with you.</i>

43:36.489 --> 43:38.481
How would you like that?

43:41.452 --> 43:45.241
You don't have to get any. I'll have enough.

43:47.041 --> 43:52.127
If you ask me,
it's too delicious not to share.

44:10.690 --> 44:13.808
- There you are.
- Yeah, sorry it took me so long.

44:19.031 --> 44:21.273
I don't get it, I just don't understand.

44:21.367 --> 44:24.110
No, look, it's not me, it's him, okay?

44:24.203 --> 44:25.785
You know, he's a drama king.

44:25.872 --> 44:28.034
Yeah, but why does he...
why does he suddenly care now?

44:28.124 --> 44:31.788
No, it... who knows?
And your guess is as good as mine.

44:31.878 --> 44:36.248
All I'm saying is can we not let this
blow up into a big scene

44:36.340 --> 44:38.297
if it doesn't have to be, please?

44:38.384 --> 44:43.095
We only have a couple more weeks.
Can we just stay cool till then?

44:43.181 --> 44:45.514
Okay?

44:45.600 --> 44:47.387
Okay, sure, but I don't understand.

44:47.476 --> 44:49.718
Okay? This doesn't make any sense to me.

44:49.812 --> 44:51.053
Robert.

45:54.627 --> 45:55.788
So.

45:57.713 --> 45:58.749
So.

46:11.060 --> 46:12.176
So.

46:13.646 --> 46:15.433
You were able to leave work.

46:16.524 --> 46:17.765
Yes.

46:18.776 --> 46:20.768
And so were you, I see.

46:22.613 --> 46:24.855
That's good.

46:24.949 --> 46:26.861
Those long hours...

46:27.994 --> 46:29.576
It's a lot to ask.

46:31.789 --> 46:33.121
Yes.

46:34.292 --> 46:37.581
It really is.

46:37.670 --> 46:41.038
It can become quite taxing,
wouldn't you agree?

46:42.258 --> 46:45.217
Yes. Why, I would.

46:46.762 --> 46:51.348
Sometimes you just have to say... fuck it.

46:55.146 --> 46:56.933
Fuck it.

47:35.061 --> 47:36.472
Oh, hey, pizza?

47:36.562 --> 47:38.679
Uh, not today, Barry, thanks. I gotta scoot.

47:45.529 --> 47:48.192
Oh, you ready?

47:48.282 --> 47:50.820
- Client?
- Yeah.

48:44.922 --> 48:47.414
"He tried not to come by dusk or later,

48:47.508 --> 48:52.754
and stand in the court,
quiet and still beneath the pines,

48:52.847 --> 48:55.385
staring at the warm buttermilk walls,

48:55.474 --> 48:58.262
the small rectangle of parched, scuffy grass

48:58.352 --> 49:02.471
where their child had taken her first steps.

49:02.565 --> 49:04.056
The window pane"...

50:00.831 --> 50:03.369
"And as you near the end
of your sweltering journey"...

50:07.296 --> 50:09.162
Mary?

50:27.066 --> 50:28.227
Mary!

50:29.443 --> 50:31.981
Oh. What happened?

50:33.113 --> 50:36.151
Well, you fell asleep on me,
that's what happened.

50:38.994 --> 50:40.530
I'm sorry.

50:40.621 --> 50:43.580
I'm sorry. I, um, I haven't had any sleep.

50:43.666 --> 50:45.453
I've been working so hard.

50:45.543 --> 50:47.535
What was the last thing
that you heard me say?

50:47.628 --> 50:50.291
- What was the last thing you heard?
- Something buttermilk?

50:50.381 --> 50:52.964
Scruffy citrus.

50:53.050 --> 50:56.168
There was so... it was beautiful, I'm sorry.

50:56.262 --> 50:59.300
I need to get rest, and then I promise you

50:59.390 --> 51:02.178
I'll make it up to you tomorrow.

51:02.268 --> 51:06.012
We can go anywhere, we can do anything.

51:06.105 --> 51:07.346
I'm sorry.

51:07.439 --> 51:09.431
I liked it, I was into it.

51:09.525 --> 51:11.187
It was good.

51:11.277 --> 51:14.566
There was a... a house.

51:16.490 --> 51:17.856
It was...

51:19.159 --> 51:21.116
So sorry, Robert.

51:21.203 --> 51:23.536
Sorry.

51:25.291 --> 51:26.782
Sorry.

51:30.588 --> 51:32.750
Really?

51:34.008 --> 51:38.255
Well, if you'd feel comfortable leaving
the house that way, I suppose you could.

51:38.345 --> 51:41.133
Bye. Talk to you soon, bye.

51:41.223 --> 51:43.431
Oh, God, what?

51:43.517 --> 51:45.133
Damn it.

51:45.227 --> 51:48.516
- Lucy, what the hell are you doing?
- Just give me the phone! Let go!

51:48.606 --> 51:51.064
No! No, are you out of your mind?

51:51.150 --> 51:54.109
No, I don't believe so.
Give me the phone and then I'll know.

51:54.194 --> 51:56.436
Know what? What is it you're trying to know?

51:58.073 --> 52:01.237
What is it you wanna know?

52:01.327 --> 52:03.569
Ow! Just... You're making a scene.

52:03.662 --> 52:05.574
Just tell me what it is
you wanna know, I'll tell you.

52:05.664 --> 52:08.452
I don't care! Just give me the phone!

52:08.542 --> 52:10.204
Look, maybe I <i>will</i> let you see my phone,

52:10.294 --> 52:12.707
but you have to tell me what it is
you're looking for first.

52:15.299 --> 52:16.961
Are you seeing someone else?

52:18.135 --> 52:20.923
No.

52:21.013 --> 52:23.926
No. No.

52:24.016 --> 52:26.554
No, of course not.
Is that what this is about?

52:31.899 --> 52:34.516
I've hardly seen you this last week.

52:34.610 --> 52:37.102
We've hardly spoken on the phone.

52:37.196 --> 52:39.358
I call you and I know
you send me to voicemail!

52:39.448 --> 52:41.940
No.

52:42.034 --> 52:46.597
Listen, firstly, I apologize. You're right.

52:46.705 --> 52:50.665
This past week, I've been overly occupied
and neglectful of you.

52:50.751 --> 52:52.162
Work has been really demanding.

52:52.252 --> 52:54.289
It always is this time of year,
but more than that,

52:54.380 --> 52:58.920
my son's visit soon has added
crazy stress at home.

52:59.968 --> 53:02.051
She always gets like this before he arrives.

53:02.137 --> 53:04.720
She... she... wants everything to be perfect.

53:04.807 --> 53:06.639
She starts calling, making all these demands.

53:06.725 --> 53:10.890
In fact, that was just her telling me to
pick up some new bedding or some shit.

53:10.979 --> 53:12.811
Look.

53:12.898 --> 53:14.890
That's who I was just talking to.

53:17.152 --> 53:19.895
So, you're fucking <i>her</i> now?

53:19.988 --> 53:22.401
Realizing this was just a big mistake?

53:24.576 --> 53:26.533
Yuck!

53:26.620 --> 53:28.907
As if!

53:28.997 --> 53:30.579
Listen, my son is... What time is it?

53:30.666 --> 53:34.250
Yes, right now he's probably out of class,

53:34.336 --> 53:36.953
headed to his place to pack.

53:37.047 --> 53:38.458
First thing tomorrow,

53:38.549 --> 53:42.509
he and his girlfriend will get on a train
on their way here.

53:42.594 --> 53:45.712
He will... they will stay with us
for three days,

53:45.806 --> 53:49.766
and for those three days, you will not be
hearing much, if anything, from me.

53:49.852 --> 53:52.686
We will have a nice, calm time,

53:52.771 --> 53:56.481
and it will be the last time as a family.

54:00.404 --> 54:01.645
The next time he visits,

54:01.739 --> 54:05.733
he'll be visiting me and you.

54:07.578 --> 54:10.412
He'll leave on Monday,

54:10.497 --> 54:13.331
and I'll tell my wife it's over,

54:13.417 --> 54:16.581
and we will be together, finally.

54:16.670 --> 54:19.253
With nothing to hide.

54:25.512 --> 54:27.504
I give you my word.

54:31.810 --> 54:37.181
You're gonna feel really silly
in just a few days' time.

54:37.274 --> 54:39.812
You're gonna be apologizing to me.

54:44.823 --> 54:47.361
And you're gonna be really happy.

54:55.292 --> 54:57.750
Let me take you home.

54:57.836 --> 54:59.498
Please?

55:21.360 --> 55:23.898
Hey.

55:30.369 --> 55:33.362
I actually can't come in right now.
I'm still...

55:33.455 --> 55:37.244
Lucy... God damn it, Lucy.

55:37.334 --> 55:39.075
Lucy.

55:50.931 --> 55:52.593
God damn it.

56:19.501 --> 56:20.742
Hi.

56:26.925 --> 56:28.507
Hey.

57:33.283 --> 57:36.617
<i>They hate each other.
You gotta understand that.</i>

57:36.703 --> 57:38.285
In fact, I'd love it if they left each other.

57:38.372 --> 57:41.866
That would be a damn relief, it's like...

57:41.959 --> 57:43.791
Oh, this should be fun.

57:43.877 --> 57:46.494
In fact, I'm actually really excited
for you to meet them.

57:46.588 --> 57:48.705
I'd appreciate it if you would study,

57:48.799 --> 57:52.133
like, if you would closely
watch both of them,

57:52.219 --> 57:57.465
and if you see me do anything
like either of them, now or ever,

57:57.557 --> 58:00.891
not only do I want you to tell me,
I want you to punch me in the face.

58:00.978 --> 58:03.140
Okay? You got it? I'm serious.

58:03.230 --> 58:05.813
- You know I'm not gonna do that.
- No, I'm serious.

58:05.899 --> 58:07.891
I'm asking you, I'm begging you.

58:09.861 --> 58:10.851
Go ahead, I'll show you.

58:10.946 --> 58:12.653
Just make a fist and then just,

58:12.739 --> 58:14.571
"No, Joel.

58:14.658 --> 58:16.570
No, Joel."

58:16.660 --> 58:17.946
Not like that, just the hand.

58:18.036 --> 58:20.119
"No, Joel. That was just like your dad.

58:20.205 --> 58:21.946
That was just like your mom."

58:25.585 --> 58:27.918
I don't know, is he still a vegetarian?

58:28.005 --> 58:29.541
'Cause if he is, she probably is.

58:29.631 --> 58:34.342
No, I think he's only eating meat now.

58:34.428 --> 58:36.920
Although I don't know
what he said about her. Ugh!

58:37.014 --> 58:40.883
You know he's gonna be
so mad at me if I forgot.

58:40.976 --> 58:42.808
Let's just fake it.

58:42.894 --> 58:46.353
Let's just make both
and we'll play it off like we know.

58:46.440 --> 58:48.932
If you don't mention it, it won't be a thing.

58:49.026 --> 58:51.268
That's mean. Okay.

58:52.487 --> 58:56.276
All right, I'm gonna get some meat.
Uh, get some Brussels sprouts

58:56.366 --> 58:59.700
or something that'll make me gassy
for the rest of the night.

59:08.545 --> 59:10.912
How's it going, buddy?

59:11.006 --> 59:14.966
Good, buddy, I'm just gonna need
another minute or two here.

59:20.515 --> 59:24.509
- How's it going, buddy?
- Yeah, I'm just having a look.

59:37.074 --> 59:38.315
Hey.

59:45.624 --> 59:48.162
She's leaving you.

59:51.296 --> 59:52.286
Who is?

59:53.632 --> 59:59.128
When your son arrives,
she's gonna tell you then.

59:59.221 --> 01:00:01.759
And there's nothing you can do to stop her.

01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:31.709
Uh, meat is the other way. Behind you.

01:00:34.172 --> 01:00:35.379
What?

01:00:36.842 --> 01:00:38.253
You're facing the wrong way.

01:00:38.343 --> 01:00:41.962
The meat you were going to get,
it's behind you.

01:00:43.682 --> 01:00:46.174
Is anybody in there?

01:00:46.268 --> 01:00:48.931
Where is it? It's behind me? I don't see it.

01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:52.138
- It's, uh, not here either.
- All right.

01:00:52.232 --> 01:00:54.770
- Strange.
- Yeah.

01:01:03.702 --> 01:01:05.364
- Hi.
- Hi. You folks ready yet?

01:01:05.453 --> 01:01:09.117
Yes, can I have four organic chicken breasts?

01:01:09.207 --> 01:01:11.745
- Sure.
- Thanks.

01:01:45.911 --> 01:01:47.243
Hello.

01:01:47.329 --> 01:01:49.867
Come here.

01:01:49.956 --> 01:01:54.542
Look at you. Oh, you.

01:01:54.628 --> 01:01:55.835
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:01:55.921 --> 01:01:57.378
- Feel like I know you. Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:01:57.464 --> 01:02:00.002
- Hey.
- Hey there, tough guy.

01:02:00.091 --> 01:02:02.083
Dad, yeah.

01:02:02.177 --> 01:02:03.839
Good to see you. Happy you came.

01:02:03.929 --> 01:02:06.012
- Hello. Hi.
- Hi, Erin.

01:02:06.097 --> 01:02:07.759
- Really happy to meet you.
- Thank you.

01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:10.683
I'll try not to say anything
that will embarrass my son,

01:02:10.769 --> 01:02:13.887
but, uh, he has expressed
some very fond feelings for you.

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:15.972
She knows I love her. Yeah.

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:19.275
- Nice.
- Well, secret is out.

01:02:19.361 --> 01:02:22.945
It's not a secret. I don't keep secrets.

01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:26.650
Really good to meet you. Welcome to our home.

01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:28.985
- Thanks for having me.
- Dinner's almost ready.

01:02:29.079 --> 01:02:31.036
I have so much of everything on.

01:02:31.122 --> 01:02:34.786
Sorry, I couldn't remember whether
you were a vegetarian or not,

01:02:34.876 --> 01:02:38.210
so I just bought a lot
and made all the options.

01:02:38.296 --> 01:02:40.913
- Well, I told you five...
- Great, that's fine.

01:02:41.007 --> 01:02:43.545
It's... really, I eat a lot
and I eat everything,

01:02:43.635 --> 01:02:46.628
so I'll happily have a plate of both options.

01:02:46.721 --> 01:02:49.259
Thank you, Erin, that's so sweet.

01:02:58.692 --> 01:03:00.183
- How about a drink?
- Yeah.

01:03:00.277 --> 01:03:02.985
- I'll, uh, I'll open some wine.
- Great, thanks.

01:03:06.866 --> 01:03:08.778
Let's go put our bags in your room.

01:03:10.161 --> 01:03:12.904
- Oh, God.
- Hey, you need to chill out.

01:03:12.998 --> 01:03:16.241
- What? Why? What am I doing?
- Jesus.

01:03:16.334 --> 01:03:17.700
She seems really nice.

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:19.251
- Yes.
- Yeah.

01:03:19.337 --> 01:03:21.420
And pretty.

01:03:21.506 --> 01:03:22.747
Yeah, very.

01:03:23.758 --> 01:03:26.421
- Well, he's a handsome guy.
- Yeah.

01:03:28.888 --> 01:03:31.426
He's got a beautiful mother.

01:04:02.005 --> 01:04:03.962
Hey.

01:04:04.049 --> 01:04:06.086
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

01:04:06.176 --> 01:04:07.587
What just happened? Are you okay?

01:04:07.677 --> 01:04:10.841
- Yeah, I'm good. Yeah.
- Okay.

01:04:17.729 --> 01:04:19.186
I don't know where it goes either.

01:04:19.272 --> 01:04:21.514
I've always been able to eat way too much.

01:04:21.608 --> 01:04:23.816
I mean, I'm sure
it's gonna catch up to me one day,

01:04:23.902 --> 01:04:26.394
but for now I'm gonna take advantage of it.

01:04:26.488 --> 01:04:28.354
Especially when the food is this good.

01:04:28.448 --> 01:04:31.737
Oh, please, please,
I'm just so glad you like it.

01:04:31.826 --> 01:04:34.364
- Do you cook as well?
- Uh, no.

01:04:34.454 --> 01:04:37.788
I mean, enough to survive.

01:04:37.874 --> 01:04:39.831
But I'm nothing like your son.

01:04:39.918 --> 01:04:42.456
He's just such a great cook.

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:44.537
- Nah.
- Oh, yeah?

01:04:44.631 --> 01:04:46.293
Yeah!

01:04:46.383 --> 01:04:49.672
Yeah, you didn't know? I mean, he's the best.

01:04:49.761 --> 01:04:53.175
No, it's nothing.
She... You have low standards.

01:04:53.264 --> 01:04:55.301
Hey. "Thank you."

01:04:55.392 --> 01:04:57.099
- Mom, it's not...
- Wait.

01:04:57.185 --> 01:04:58.426
Oh, okay.

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:00.227
- Be quiet.
- You serious?

01:05:00.313 --> 01:05:03.021
What are you saying? You're crazy.

01:05:03.108 --> 01:05:04.474
No, don't listen to him.

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:09.440
Let's have a toast.

01:05:12.075 --> 01:05:13.361
Excellent idea.

01:05:14.869 --> 01:05:17.282
- Who needs... who needs some?
- A little.

01:05:18.832 --> 01:05:20.039
- Oh.
- Yes?

01:05:20.125 --> 01:05:22.663
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:29.915
Ah.

01:05:32.345 --> 01:05:35.338
To you both.

01:05:35.432 --> 01:05:38.516
Uh, we're so happy to meet you, Erin.

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:42.015
- Thank you.
- And to have you both home.

01:05:42.105 --> 01:05:43.391
Yes.

01:05:43.481 --> 01:05:47.646
Yeah. Hear, hear.

01:05:47.735 --> 01:05:50.273
- Well put.
- Thanks.

01:05:59.622 --> 01:06:03.332
So, I think I figured this out.

01:06:03.418 --> 01:06:05.580
You cook and you eat.

01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:06.660
Yes.

01:06:06.754 --> 01:06:09.121
That's the way you two work.

01:06:09.215 --> 01:06:11.798
- So well.
- Whatever works.

01:06:11.885 --> 01:06:12.875
That's what I say.

01:06:14.888 --> 01:06:17.926
Well, that was nice.

01:06:19.726 --> 01:06:20.967
Yes.

01:06:22.228 --> 01:06:24.766
He seems happy. She's great.

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:33.988
Didn't know he could cook. Did you?

01:06:36.117 --> 01:06:37.358
Yes.

01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:40.987
Maybe, I don't know.

01:06:47.504 --> 01:06:49.336
Guess we'll find out soon enough.

01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:52.456
Yes.

01:07:01.059 --> 01:07:03.426
Tomorrow, right?

01:07:04.562 --> 01:07:06.394
We'll find out tomorrow.

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:11.692
Yes.

01:07:21.538 --> 01:07:23.120
Night.

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:28.162
Good night.

01:07:52.443 --> 01:07:54.560
Hi.

01:07:54.654 --> 01:07:56.441
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:07:57.574 --> 01:08:00.533
There's coffee ready and, uh, scrambled eggs,

01:08:00.618 --> 01:08:03.326
but they may be cold by now.

01:08:03.413 --> 01:08:05.450
All right, uh...

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:07.122
Why, what time is it?

01:08:07.208 --> 01:08:10.576
- It's a little after 11:00.
- Wow, I was tired!

01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:15.040
- Uh, where's Mary?
- I'm not sure.

01:08:15.133 --> 01:08:18.001
She said she had to run an errand.

01:08:18.094 --> 01:08:20.211
I'm sure she'll be back soon.

01:08:20.305 --> 01:08:23.469
- How about some coffee?
- Oh, yes.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:27.435
Oh, I should... uh, I should get Joel up.

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:28.600
No, no, no.

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:32.022
Let's let him sleep.

01:08:34.652 --> 01:08:38.612
I'm sure you both hardly get any
with all the studying.

01:08:39.741 --> 01:08:41.107
Here you go.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.487
- Thank you.
- Of course.

01:08:45.872 --> 01:08:49.206
What college did you go to?
I mean, did you go to college?

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:51.203
I can't remember if Joel told me or not.

01:08:51.294 --> 01:08:54.332
Actually, no. I, uh...

01:08:55.506 --> 01:09:01.046
I wasn't serious about things at that age,
at your age.

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:04.380
I, uh, I had other ideas, things.

01:09:04.474 --> 01:09:05.760
Oh, yeah?

01:09:08.144 --> 01:09:11.136
Music.

01:09:11.229 --> 01:09:13.142
I thought maybe, uh...

01:09:15.234 --> 01:09:19.228
I played a lot of music.
Mostly keyboard, piano.

01:09:20.365 --> 01:09:22.322
Ah, I was wondering about that.

01:09:22.408 --> 01:09:25.242
I figured Joel took lessons as a kid.

01:09:25.328 --> 01:09:26.738
Mm.

01:09:27.747 --> 01:09:30.205
Well, I wanna hear. Play something.

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:33.375
- No.
- Oh.

01:09:33.461 --> 01:09:39.002
Those days are far away.
That thing is a shelf now.

01:09:39.091 --> 01:09:41.505
If it wasn't so heavy, it'd be long gone.

01:09:41.594 --> 01:09:45.587
So, when you met Mary, you were a musician?

01:09:47.308 --> 01:09:51.473
A long, long time ago.

01:09:51.562 --> 01:09:52.723
Oh.

01:09:55.149 --> 01:09:57.186
I sold her a bill of goods.

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:00.686
Well, we all change.

01:10:03.408 --> 01:10:05.070
Yeah.

01:10:07.412 --> 01:10:08.823
It's too bad.

01:10:11.082 --> 01:10:14.075
Oh, well. What can you do?

01:10:19.632 --> 01:10:20.918
<i>Don't fall for his bullshit.</i>

01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:25.923
Not after so many years of it, not when...

01:10:27.765 --> 01:10:30.758
We're so close.

01:10:30.852 --> 01:10:34.345
<i>You</i> are so close to finally breaking free.

01:10:34.439 --> 01:10:38.934
No, but I can't do it.
It's... not... I'm confused.

01:10:40.194 --> 01:10:41.810
I'm confused.

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:44.317
And my son is here with his girlfriend.

01:10:44.407 --> 01:10:46.945
- It's not a good time.
- Mary, listen to me.

01:10:48.494 --> 01:10:51.282
It is a good time.

01:10:51.372 --> 01:10:53.409
- It's the only time.
- No.

01:10:53.499 --> 01:10:56.617
This is all you get, this is it, okay?

01:10:56.711 --> 01:11:00.796
It's either him or me, and I'm not even
joking this time, okay?

01:11:00.882 --> 01:11:02.373
You need to make a choice.

01:11:04.051 --> 01:11:05.337
Now.

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:13.263
But before you make this choice,
you need to consider this.

01:11:13.352 --> 01:11:14.809
Is this man he's being now,

01:11:14.896 --> 01:11:18.810
this... this new him
who would suddenly, after years,

01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:22.268
turn into Mr. Right the very week
that he feels threatened,

01:11:22.361 --> 01:11:27.231
when he knows that he's gonna lose you...

01:11:27.325 --> 01:11:28.566
Is that the real him?

01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:31.781
If that's not the case,

01:11:31.871 --> 01:11:33.783
then you know it's only a matter of time

01:11:33.873 --> 01:11:36.616
before the real him shows himself again.

01:11:38.252 --> 01:11:41.290
The man you couldn't take until recently.

01:11:43.382 --> 01:11:47.957
And this time... you'll be facing it alone.

01:11:52.225 --> 01:11:55.218
All alone, I swear to God.
I will move if I have to.

01:11:58.272 --> 01:12:01.731
You will never, ever see me again.

01:12:03.861 --> 01:12:05.272
Have <i>me</i> to cry to.

01:12:06.906 --> 01:12:09.649
Have <i>me</i> to love you.

01:12:09.742 --> 01:12:12.610
Not until you make your decision.

01:12:20.211 --> 01:12:22.328
Oh, there she is.

01:12:24.131 --> 01:12:25.713
Hello.

01:12:26.717 --> 01:12:28.458
- Hello.
- Hi, Mom.

01:12:31.055 --> 01:12:33.889
They just had breakfast
if you can believe it.

01:12:33.975 --> 01:12:37.093
When was the last time you woke up at noon?

01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:39.894
Geez, I miss those days.

01:12:39.981 --> 01:12:41.472
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:12:41.566 --> 01:12:44.024
Hey, we were just hearing
about the cover band.

01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:46.773
- The worst.
- Mm-hmm.

01:12:46.863 --> 01:12:49.401
I thought we should be called The Butchers.

01:12:55.538 --> 01:12:57.404
So, what, this is it?

01:12:57.498 --> 01:13:00.832
- Pajamas all day? Hmm?
- Mm-hmm.

01:13:00.918 --> 01:13:02.534
What, are you gonna go back to bed now?

01:13:02.628 --> 01:13:04.585
You gonna have a little
breakfast at dinnertime?

01:13:04.672 --> 01:13:07.210
- What's up?
- No, we're gonna make dinner.

01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:10.088
And when I say we, I obviously mean him.

01:13:10.177 --> 01:13:12.635
Oh, is that true?

01:13:12.722 --> 01:13:14.930
For real?

01:13:15.016 --> 01:13:17.303
- Sure, why not?
- Good.

01:13:17.393 --> 01:13:18.429
Oh.

01:13:20.688 --> 01:13:25.228
Well, I guess, uh...
I'll take Erin shopping with me.

01:13:25.318 --> 01:13:27.025
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

01:13:27.111 --> 01:13:31.856
And then if you need some help cooking,
your father can... Stop.

01:13:31.949 --> 01:13:34.236
- Stop it.
- What? What can I do?

01:13:34.327 --> 01:13:37.161
I don't know. You tell us.

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:39.454
What can you do?

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:41.202
Huh?

01:13:45.713 --> 01:13:48.251
- Have fun, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:14:00.394 --> 01:14:01.930
You want something to drink?

01:14:02.021 --> 01:14:05.014
Some, uh, soda or something?

01:14:11.614 --> 01:14:13.025
What?

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:45.725
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:15:02.456 --> 01:15:03.992
So...

01:15:10.381 --> 01:15:12.543
Seems like you and Mom are getting along.

01:15:15.094 --> 01:15:17.632
It happens.

01:15:20.558 --> 01:15:21.844
Does it?

01:15:23.477 --> 01:15:25.093
Occasionally.

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:28.976
It's cool.

01:15:45.499 --> 01:15:48.833
- I've been having a really good time.
- Oh.

01:15:48.919 --> 01:15:51.036
Wanted to meet you for awhile.

01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:56.007
I mean, Joel, he loves you, you know?

01:15:56.093 --> 01:15:57.379
Oh, I know.

01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:59.382
It's just nice to hear.

01:16:00.598 --> 01:16:04.137
He's not the best at sharing.
At least with me.

01:16:04.226 --> 01:16:07.310
Well, what guy is?

01:16:07.396 --> 01:16:08.932
What the...?

01:16:14.945 --> 01:16:17.437
Excuse me.

01:16:25.998 --> 01:16:28.206
What was that?

01:16:28.292 --> 01:16:29.749
No, it's... it's all right.

01:16:29.835 --> 01:16:32.794
- Did she just hiss at you?
- It's all right.

01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:35.668
- That's insane.
- It's all right. It's all right.

01:16:35.758 --> 01:16:38.045
Coming.

01:16:41.639 --> 01:16:43.380
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:16:43.474 --> 01:16:45.807
You're a vision on my front porch.
You don't have to ring the bell, hon.

01:16:45.893 --> 01:16:47.304
- You can just come in.
- Okay.

01:16:47.394 --> 01:16:48.851
Where's Mary? Does she need
help with the bags?

01:16:48.938 --> 01:16:51.180
No, she doesn't. She's out.

01:16:51.273 --> 01:16:54.391
"She's out"? Okay, well, come on in.

01:16:54.485 --> 01:16:57.569
Hold on, that's her.

01:16:57.655 --> 01:16:59.066
Hello?

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:03.738
Okay. All right, hold, uh...

01:17:05.162 --> 01:17:06.824
Let me get upstairs. Hold on.

01:17:10.543 --> 01:17:12.034
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:17:14.505 --> 01:17:15.791
- That was weird.
- Yeah.

01:17:15.881 --> 01:17:18.294
- What was that?
- I don't know.

01:17:18.384 --> 01:17:20.967
What's wrong? What happened now?

01:17:21.053 --> 01:17:23.796
Something weird happened outside just now.

01:17:23.889 --> 01:17:26.302
Wait, what do you mean "weird"?

01:17:26.392 --> 01:17:28.509
Why? What are you talking about?

01:17:30.104 --> 01:17:31.345
Okay.

01:17:34.150 --> 01:17:35.436
Okay.

01:17:40.364 --> 01:17:41.605
Okay.

01:17:59.884 --> 01:18:01.375
Where's Mom?

01:18:01.468 --> 01:18:03.505
No, don't bullshit me. Where's Mom?

01:18:03.596 --> 01:18:04.837
She'll be here soon.

01:18:04.930 --> 01:18:08.640
- Soon? Where did she go?
- I don't know.

01:18:08.726 --> 01:18:10.012
I need you to tell me where she went.

01:18:10.102 --> 01:18:12.719
I swear to God,
I will beat the shit out of you.

01:18:12.813 --> 01:18:14.600
All we can do is wait.

01:18:15.858 --> 01:18:17.394
No, Joel!

01:18:19.612 --> 01:18:22.650
You're a cheating piece of shit.
You know that, right?

01:18:24.617 --> 01:18:27.200
You do know that, right?

01:18:28.871 --> 01:18:30.112
Yes.

01:20:12.641 --> 01:20:17.386
I know you're mad at him,
but I made mistakes, too.

01:20:18.564 --> 01:20:21.102
I'm sorry, you'll never know how sorry I am.

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:29.940
We messed up, but we're not bad people.

01:20:34.788 --> 01:20:36.120
Okay.

01:21:26.215 --> 01:21:27.547
Please?

01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:31.922
Nah, I don't need to sit. I'm fine here.

01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:34.842
What happened to your hand?

01:21:36.308 --> 01:21:40.473
Oh. Please, please sit down.

01:21:40.562 --> 01:21:42.394
I'm asking you, please.

01:21:42.481 --> 01:21:44.939
I don't know why, though. I mean, I got it.

01:21:45.943 --> 01:21:48.310
Dad's a lying, cheating piece of shit,

01:21:48.404 --> 01:21:52.239
and you're leaving him,
you've finally had enough of it, right?

01:21:58.163 --> 01:21:59.529
Yes, right.

01:22:02.501 --> 01:22:05.209
- Okay.
- No, but don't, please.

01:22:05.295 --> 01:22:07.161
This is my time to talk,

01:22:07.256 --> 01:22:09.794
so would you sit the fuck down?

01:22:13.595 --> 01:22:17.054
Damn it, I get it, okay?

01:22:17.141 --> 01:22:20.930
I get it, it's worse for you
than it is for everyone else.

01:22:23.313 --> 01:22:26.431
And I am sorry.

01:22:26.525 --> 01:22:28.107
You'll never know how sorry I am,

01:22:28.193 --> 01:22:31.982
and I'm sure you'll never forgive him or me.

01:22:32.072 --> 01:22:35.315
This is why I wanted to wait to tell you
until you were here,

01:22:35.409 --> 01:22:36.650
so we could speak face-to-face

01:22:36.743 --> 01:22:40.953
and you would be with somebody
that you love and that loves you.

01:22:42.124 --> 01:22:45.583
- So, let me just say...
- Wait a second.

01:22:45.669 --> 01:22:47.661
You were planning on telling me this?

01:22:47.754 --> 01:22:50.292
You were waiting until I got here?

01:22:52.509 --> 01:22:54.592
So, why all the show?

01:22:54.678 --> 01:22:57.716
Like, why would you...

01:22:57.806 --> 01:23:00.093
act like this, that?

01:23:00.184 --> 01:23:02.847
Like, why are you acting
like you're happy together?

01:23:05.647 --> 01:23:08.060
Okay, we weren't pretending.

01:23:08.150 --> 01:23:10.938
No, no, you don't get the chance
to tell me anything.

01:23:11.028 --> 01:23:13.736
No. 'Cause none of it's true.

01:23:15.616 --> 01:23:18.734
You're the same as him.
You're the same hypocrites.

01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:20.113
You fucking disgust me.

01:23:20.204 --> 01:23:21.570
- Joel.
- Joel.

01:23:21.663 --> 01:23:25.998
No. Fuck your stupid lies
and your bullshit world.

01:23:27.794 --> 01:23:29.626
No, Joel!

01:23:29.713 --> 01:23:31.875
Fuck... it's all bullshit. That's bullshit.

01:23:31.965 --> 01:23:33.627
- Honey!
- Don't, no.

01:23:33.717 --> 01:23:35.299
- It's bullshit. Bullshit.
- Stop!

01:23:35.385 --> 01:23:38.219
Fuck this. I'm getting your stuff.
We're out of this place.

01:23:40.766 --> 01:23:42.177
God.

01:23:46.688 --> 01:23:47.849
Well.

01:23:49.358 --> 01:23:50.815
Geez.

01:23:50.901 --> 01:23:53.894
You have to do something.

01:23:55.656 --> 01:24:00.026
We can't let him leave like this.
We'll never see him again.

01:24:04.665 --> 01:24:06.201
But he's right.

01:24:11.421 --> 01:24:13.378
Come on, you're dragging this out.
We need to go.

01:24:13.465 --> 01:24:16.833
- I'm going as fast as I can.
- Well...

01:24:16.927 --> 01:24:20.466
- Are you sure you wanna leave like this?
- Yeah. No, are you kidding me?

01:24:20.556 --> 01:24:24.846
We need to go now, Erin.
We need to go, like, right now.

01:24:42.995 --> 01:24:44.111
Hey.

01:24:46.832 --> 01:24:49.916
- Baby, it's okay.
- No.

01:24:50.002 --> 01:24:52.870
Sorry.

01:24:52.963 --> 01:24:56.127
I'm sorry. Sweetheart...

01:26:40.278 --> 01:26:44.818
<i># I never thought I'd miss you #</i>

01:26:44.908 --> 01:26:47.366
