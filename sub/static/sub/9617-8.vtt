WEBVTT

00:06.240 --> 00:07.339
(both laughing)

00:08.309 --> 00:09.808
THEY'RE SO CUTE TOGETHER!

00:09.810 --> 00:11.944
WE'RE CUTE TOGETHER,
RILEY.

00:14.749 --> 00:17.282
WHOA-HO-HO...
OH!

00:19.420 --> 00:20.486
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:22.857 --> 00:25.691
WHY DO THEY SHOVE CAKE
AND WE DON'T SHOVE CAKE?

00:25.693 --> 00:28.260
RILEY?
IS IT OVER BETWEEN US?

00:30.364 --> 00:32.398
IT'S NOT ME, DAD. IT'S YOU.

00:33.334 --> 00:34.767
OKAY! EVENING OVER!

00:34.769 --> 00:36.201
Both: HEY!

00:36.203 --> 00:37.603
DID YOU GIRLS DO
YOUR HOMEWORK?

00:37.605 --> 00:38.637
I DID EXCELLENT WORK.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.205
I ALSO DID EXCELLENT WORK.

00:40.207 --> 00:41.874
ONE OF US IS
COMPLETELY LYING.

00:41.876 --> 00:43.642
-CAN YOU GUESS WHO?
-GIVE THEM A HINT.

00:43.644 --> 00:45.744
-YOU GUYS NEED A HINT?
-Cory and Shawn: NO.

00:47.348 --> 00:48.814
THEY REALLY GET
ALONG TOGETHER, HUH?

00:48.816 --> 00:50.416
YEAH. THE SOUND OF
MY DAUGHTER'S LAUGHTER

00:50.418 --> 00:53.218
HAS ALWAYS BEEN
MY FAVORITE SONG.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.587
YOU AND I HAVE THE
SAME TASTE IN MUSIC.

00:55.589 --> 00:58.457
YOU KNOW,
A LITTLE DISCIPLINE
ISN'T A BAD THING, MAYA.

00:58.459 --> 01:00.392
OH, THANKS, MR. MATTHEWS.
I'LL PONDER ON THAT.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.466
I'M SORRY, WHAT?

01:11.572 --> 01:13.972
YEAH. JUST BECAUSE
YOU DO THE SAME
WEIRD GESTURE TWICE

01:13.974 --> 01:14.940
DOESN'T MEAN
I GET IT.

01:14.942 --> 01:18.877
YOU KNOW, THIS IS USUALLY
THE PART OF THE EVENING

01:18.879 --> 01:21.313
WHEN PEOPLE GIVE OUT
<i>FATHERLY  </i> ADVICE.

01:21.315 --> 01:24.416
OH! (laughs) NO!

01:24.418 --> 01:26.885
NO, IT'S NOT MY PLACE.

01:26.887 --> 01:28.954
GO AHEAD.
WHAT ADVICE YOU GOT FOR ME?
I CAN TAKE IT.

01:28.956 --> 01:31.356
OH, COME ON!
WE WERE HAVING SUCH
A GOOD EVENING.

01:31.358 --> 01:32.691
CAN'T WE JUST
LEAVE IT AT THAT?

01:32.693 --> 01:33.892
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

01:35.029 --> 01:36.829
-BOOM!
-OH!

01:36.831 --> 01:38.497
YOU DON'T THINK
I CAN TAKE IT?

01:38.499 --> 01:40.933
GO AHEAD. PING!
GO AHEAD. PONG!

01:40.935 --> 01:42.000
KA-BLAM!

01:43.537 --> 01:45.270
COME ON! LET'S DO THIS!

01:45.272 --> 01:47.556
TELL ME TO DO
MY HOMEWORK.

01:47.557 --> 01:49.841
MAYBE I WILL JUST DO IT.
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW IT.
COME ON! LET'S DO THIS.

01:52.413 --> 01:54.379
WHY DON'T YOU EVER
DO SOMETHING ALL CUTE
LIKE THAT?

01:54.381 --> 01:55.981
OKAY! POW!

01:55.983 --> 01:56.982
OW!

01:56.984 --> 02:00.652
COME ON.
YOU GOT SOMETHING FOR ME?
OUT WITH IT. I DARE YOU.

02:00.654 --> 02:04.056
NO. NO, NO.
I HAVE THIS WONDERFUL
INSTINCT FOR TOO FAR.

02:04.058 --> 02:05.524
AND WE HAVE ARRIVED.

02:05.525 --> 02:06.991
THERE IS NOTHING HE COULD
SAY THAT WOULD BOTHER ME.

02:06.994 --> 02:08.393
IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

02:09.563 --> 02:11.029
(mimicking chicken clucking)

02:11.031 --> 02:14.766
OH, RIGHT, RIGHT.
BECAUSE CHICKEN NOISES

02:14.768 --> 02:17.069
WORK ON A GROWN MAN.

02:18.005 --> 02:19.872
CLUCK! CLUCK!

02:20.975 --> 02:23.509
I'M A CHICKEN! CLUCK!

02:25.513 --> 02:27.779
ALL RIGHT. YOU WANT ONE
PIECE OF FATHERLY ADVICE?

02:27.781 --> 02:29.548
AND HERE COMES
THE END OF EVERYTHING.

02:29.550 --> 02:30.916
SURE, GIVE IT
YOUR BEST SHOT.

02:30.918 --> 02:32.451
OH, HOW BAD
COULD IT BE?

02:32.453 --> 02:33.919
I THINK YOU SHOULD
DRESS DIFFERENTLY.

02:38.626 --> 02:39.892
WHAT DID YOU
JUST SAY TO ME?

02:39.894 --> 02:43.095
OH. YOU SEE...

02:44.465 --> 02:47.766
YOU ASKED ME FOR ADVICE.
I TOLD YOU... BUT YOU PUSHED.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.936
ARE YOU CRYING?
I MADE YOU CRY?

02:51.972 --> 02:55.040
MAYA, YOU ASKED
ME FOR ADVICE

02:55.042 --> 02:56.808
AND I JUST TOLD YOU
HOW I WAS FEELING.

02:56.810 --> 02:57.776
WHY ARE YOU CRYING?

02:57.778 --> 03:02.147
BECAUSE NO ONE'S EVER CARED
ENOUGH TO SAY THAT TO ME.

03:08.856 --> 03:11.990
WELL, NOW I WOULD
TAKE EXCEPTION TO THAT,

03:11.992 --> 03:14.826
BUT WOW, I LIKE
WHERE THIS IS GOING.

03:14.828 --> 03:17.129
(sobbing)

03:17.131 --> 03:19.097
MAKE IT STOP.

03:19.099 --> 03:20.432
CAN WE MAKE IT STOP?

03:20.434 --> 03:23.101
HOW DO I MAKE IT STOP?

03:25.406 --> 03:27.139
HOW 'BOUT I BUY YOU
SOME NEW CLOTHES?

03:27.141 --> 03:28.574
(sobbing stops)

03:33.113 --> 03:34.580
OKAY.

03:36.116 --> 03:37.549
(sobbing) YOU'RE RIGHT.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.818
MAYBE WE SHOULD BE
MORE LIKE THEM.

03:41.522 --> 03:43.155
NOW YOU SAY I GET
NEW CLOTHES.

03:45.492 --> 03:47.025
YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE, RILEY.

03:48.829 --> 03:49.861

04:53.527 --> 04:55.927
TRYIN' ON CLOTHES
IS ALL DAY.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.229
NO, I'M JUST HERE
TO BUY A KID AN OUTFIT.

04:57.231 --> 04:58.930
I KNOW.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.651
NOT GONNA CHANGE YOU AT ALL

05:02.652 --> 05:05.103
WHEN SHE STEPS OUT FROM
BEHIND THAT CURTAIN, WITH A
LOOK ON HER FACE THAT SAYS,

05:05.105 --> 05:06.738
"DO YOU THINK THIS MAKES
ME LOOK BEAUTIFUL, DAD?"

05:06.740 --> 05:09.107
I'M NOT GOING TO SIT IN ONE
OF THESE DADDY CHAIRS

05:09.109 --> 05:11.243
AND WAIT FOR A KID
TO SPEND MY MONEY.

05:11.245 --> 05:13.245
I KNOW! SIT IN
THE CHAIR, SHAWN.

05:13.247 --> 05:15.814
I AM NEVER GOING TO
SIT IN THAT CHAIR!

05:17.184 --> 05:19.651
GENTLEMEN,
MAY I NOW PRESENT

05:19.653 --> 05:22.254
THE NEW AND
DEFINITELY IMPROVED

05:22.256 --> 05:24.440
MISS MAYA HART.

05:24.441 --> 05:26.625
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. COME ON OUT.
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU PUT TOGETHER.

05:31.265 --> 05:32.731
(chuckles)

05:37.938 --> 05:39.071
I KNOW.

05:41.608 --> 05:42.641
DO YOU LIKE IT?

05:42.643 --> 05:44.509
(stammers)

05:45.746 --> 05:48.113
WOW. LOOK AT YOU.

05:50.250 --> 05:52.250
YEAH. THIS MIGHT BE
MY FAVORITE DAY EVER.

05:55.222 --> 05:58.090
SHAWN, YOU REALLY DON'T
HAVE TO DO THIS.

05:58.091 --> 06:00.959
I WANT TO. I WANT TO BE
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS,
IF YOU'LL LET ME.

06:01.895 --> 06:03.545
THANK YOU.

06:03.546 --> 06:05.196
NO ONE'S EVER DONE ANYTHING
LIKE THIS FOR ME BEFORE.

06:05.199 --> 06:06.264
YOU'RE WELCOME.

06:07.201 --> 06:10.202
NOW, PICK
SOMETHING ELSE OUT

06:10.204 --> 06:13.905
AND GO BACK INTO THE DRESSING
ROOM AND BE HAPPY AND COME OUT
WITH THAT FACE ON.

06:14.842 --> 06:17.059
YOU'LL BE OKAY?

06:17.060 --> 06:19.277
OH, I'M FINE.
I-- I HAVE THIS CHAIR.

06:24.251 --> 06:25.851
-NO!
-BUT MY FACE!

06:25.853 --> 06:27.552
-NO!
-BUT I LOVE YOU.

06:27.554 --> 06:28.920
NO!

06:28.922 --> 06:29.988
I'LL TEACH YOU
THAT NEXT.

06:31.825 --> 06:34.860
I WENT SHOPPING FOR GIRLS
CLOTHES AND HAD A GOOD TIME.

06:37.664 --> 06:39.297
WHAT IS HAPPENING TO ME?

06:40.734 --> 06:43.702
-WHAT DO YOU THINK?
-WOW! NEW LOOK, MAYA.
YOU LOOK GREAT.

06:45.305 --> 06:46.605
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL,
BABY GIRL.

06:46.607 --> 06:47.839
THANKS, MOM.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.641
CAN I HAVE YOUR T-SHIRT
WITH THE BIG TONGUE?

06:49.643 --> 06:51.676
I LIKE THAT BIG TONGUE.
BLAH!

06:56.583 --> 06:59.117
-CORY!
-NO! IT'S NOT HERS.
I GOT HER NOTHIN'!

07:00.654 --> 07:04.156
SHAWN! THAT'S ALL FOR MAYA?
IT'S TOO MUCH.

07:04.158 --> 07:05.690
KATY, WHY DO YOU
WORK SO HARD?

07:05.692 --> 07:07.259
TO KEEP THE
LIGHTS ON, SHAWN.

07:07.261 --> 07:09.294
KATY, WHY DO YOU
WORK SO HARD?

07:09.296 --> 07:12.030
BECAUSE I HAVE A DAUGHTER
TO TAKE CARE OF.

07:12.032 --> 07:14.366
THERE YOU GO.
AND I JUST HAVE ME.

07:14.368 --> 07:17.369
I TRAVEL LIGHT.
I JUST NEED A CUP OF COFFEE
AND A SANDWICH,

07:17.371 --> 07:19.237
'CAUSE OF THAT
I'VE BEEN ABLE TO PUT
A LITTLE MONEY AWAY.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.306
HOW MUCH MONEY?

07:21.308 --> 07:22.774
THAT MUCH RIGHT THERE.

07:23.744 --> 07:25.844
AND NOW IT'S ALL GONE.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.646
I LIKE TAKING CARE OF
SOMEBODY BESIDES ME.

07:32.853 --> 07:35.003
MAYA ADORES YOU.

07:35.004 --> 07:37.154
AND THE DEEPER THAT
THIS GETS, THE MORE
IT'S GOING TO CRUSH HER WHEN--

07:38.158 --> 07:39.724
"WHEN" WHAT?

07:39.726 --> 07:41.726
HER LEGS GET CUT OUT
FROM UNDER HER.

07:41.728 --> 07:44.930
KATY. CAN WE JUST
HAVE A GOOD DAY?

07:44.932 --> 07:46.665
YOU KEEP THE
LIGHTS ON. RIGHT?

07:46.667 --> 07:48.700
AND I DRESS THE KID
UP A LITTLE BIT.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.635
CAN'T WE JUST LOOK
AT HER AND SMILE?

07:52.673 --> 07:54.105
YEAH. I GUESS WE CAN.

07:55.409 --> 07:56.975
-WE GOOD?
-WE'RE GOOD.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.177
THANK YOU.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.348
YEAH, YOU DIDN'T
TELL HIM THAT

08:03.350 --> 08:05.717
KEEPING THE LIGHTS ON
ISN'T QUITE AS GLAMOROUS

08:05.719 --> 08:08.086
FOR YOUR DAUGHTER AS
A WHOLE NEW WARDROBE,
DID YOU?

08:08.088 --> 08:09.254
HE DID A KIND THING.

08:09.256 --> 08:11.723
I STOPPED HOPING
FOR ANY GLORY LONG AGO.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.060
HEY. YOU.
WHO'S YOUR MAMA?

08:15.062 --> 08:16.294
THAT PRETTY BLOND LADY.

08:17.898 --> 08:20.098
SHE DOES ALL
THE HEAVY LIFTING.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.234
I GOT TO DO
SOMETHING FUN.

08:22.236 --> 08:25.837
SO THIS STUFF
COMES FROM ME AND HER.

08:25.839 --> 08:26.738
DON'T EVER FORGET THAT.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.741
I WON'T.
THANKS, MOM.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.751
-WHAT'S THIS FOR?
-NOTHING.

08:40.954 --> 08:42.187
EVERYTHING.

08:46.426 --> 08:49.928
YOU KNOW, MAYA, YOU CAN BORROW
ANY OF MY CLOTHES
WHENEVER YOU WANT.

08:51.465 --> 08:52.748
THANKS.

08:52.749 --> 08:54.032
YOU CAN NEVER TOUCH
ANY OF THIS STUFF.

09:01.275 --> 09:03.041
IT ISN'T ABOUT
THE CLOTHES, YOU KNOW?

09:04.077 --> 09:06.011
IT'S THAT SOMEONE WANTED
TO DO THIS FOR ME.

09:06.947 --> 09:09.414
OF COURSE IT ISN'T
ABOUT THE CLOTHES.
IT'S ABOUT YOU.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.353
-LOVE IT!
-LOOK AT ME.

09:15.355 --> 09:16.721
YAY!

09:17.824 --> 09:19.925
-I NEED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.
-ANYTHING.

09:19.927 --> 09:21.726
-AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO REACT.
-I WON'T.

09:21.728 --> 09:24.095
BECAUSE IF YOU REACT TOO BIG,
YOU'RE GOING TO JINX IT.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.497
PLEASE DON'T JINX IT.

09:27.501 --> 09:29.901
-LOVE IT!
-I KNOW!

09:33.440 --> 09:35.090
YAY!

09:35.091 --> 09:36.741
I THINK THERE'S A CHANCE
I MIGHT'VE BEEN LIVING LIFE
ALL WRONG.

09:36.743 --> 09:39.277
AND I THINK, MAYBE
YOU'VE BEEN RIGHT.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.513
I LIKE WHEN I'M RIGHT.
WHAT AM I RIGHT ABOUT?

09:41.515 --> 09:43.214
DON'T GET ALL
EXCITED, OKAY?

09:43.216 --> 09:45.450
(excitedly)
I PROMISE TO
NOT BE EXCITED!

09:47.487 --> 09:49.421
I USED TO THINK
HOPE WAS FOR SUCKERS.

09:51.391 --> 09:52.457
LOVE IT!

09:52.459 --> 09:53.925
THIS IS ME NOW!

09:53.927 --> 09:55.427
YAY!

09:57.197 --> 09:59.497
BUT MAYBE IF YOU
DON'T HOPE FOR TOO MUCH,

09:59.499 --> 10:01.366
BUT LET YOURSELF
HOPE FOR ONE THING,

10:01.368 --> 10:02.534
IT MIGHT ACTUALLY HAPPEN.

10:03.870 --> 10:05.470
TODAY WAS A REAL GOOD DAY.

10:05.472 --> 10:08.006
I'M GOING TO HOPE
FOR ONE MORE AND
WE'LL SEE WHAT COMES.

10:09.509 --> 10:11.042
PLEASE DON'T GET
EXCITED AND JINX IT.

10:19.086 --> 10:20.185
OKAY, LET IT OUT.

10:20.187 --> 10:21.486
LOVE IT!

10:21.488 --> 10:24.189
-ME, TOO!
-YAY!

10:24.191 --> 10:26.057
-NO!
-OKAY!

10:30.831 --> 10:32.397
IT CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.

10:32.399 --> 10:35.433
THE WINDS WERE BLOWING
AT 175 MILES AN HOUR.

10:35.435 --> 10:37.469
A "CATEGORY FIVE" HURRICANE.

10:37.471 --> 10:39.404
THERE IS NO CATEGORY SIX.

10:40.507 --> 10:42.574
-WHO KNOWS WHAT A LEVEE IS?
-RILEY.

10:42.576 --> 10:45.076
IT'S LIKE A HILL OR A DAM
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO KEEP
WATER OUT.

10:45.078 --> 10:49.247
"SUPPOSED TO." SO, WE BUILD
THESE PROTECTIONS TO KEEP
OUT THE ELEMENTS,

10:49.249 --> 10:52.317
BUT SOMETIMES THE STORM
IS STRONGER THAN WE ARE.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.053
WHO KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT
NEW ORLEANS GEOGRAPHY?

10:55.055 --> 10:57.222
-FARKLE.
-IT'S BELOW SEA LEVEL.

10:57.224 --> 10:58.590
SO WHERE DOES
THE FLOODWATER GO?

10:58.592 --> 11:00.592
DOWN. RIGHT INTO THE CITY.

11:00.594 --> 11:01.893
AND WHAT'S THE RESULT?

11:03.630 --> 11:06.564
-LUCAS.
-PARISH AFTER PARISH
WAS DESTROYED.

11:06.566 --> 11:09.834
PEOPLE LOST THEIR HOMES.
PEOPLE LOST EVERYTHING.

11:09.836 --> 11:12.037
LUCAS WENT THERE
FROM TEXAS TO HELP OUT.

11:12.039 --> 11:14.005
-I TOLD YOU THAT?
-NOPE.

11:15.442 --> 11:18.610
YOU KNOW, WHEN IT ENDED,
THERE WERE JAZZ BANDS
PLAYING ON THE STREET.

11:18.612 --> 11:22.414
OTHER PEOPLE CAME OUT OF
WHAT WAS LEFT OF THEIR
HOUSES TO DANCE.

11:22.416 --> 11:24.215
YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY DO IN NEW ORLEANS?

11:24.217 --> 11:27.385
THEY HAVE
HURRICANE BARBECUES.
HURRICANE PICNICS.

11:28.588 --> 11:31.489
THEIR CITY DROWNED
BUT THEY STILL
CELEBRATED EACH OTHER.

11:31.491 --> 11:32.924
THANK YOU, LUCAS.

11:33.927 --> 11:37.128
SO, THEIR HOMES ARE GONE.

11:37.130 --> 11:38.596
THEY HAVE NO POWER.

11:38.598 --> 11:41.499
AND THEY LIVE IN A CITY WHERE
EVEN GEOGRAPHY TELLS THEM

11:41.501 --> 11:43.635
IT'S A SUCKER'S
BET TO STAY.

11:43.637 --> 11:44.969
WHAT DO THEY DO?

11:46.606 --> 11:49.007
-MAYA, RAISE YOUR HAND.
-I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER.

11:49.009 --> 11:51.342
STOP HIDING OUT
IN MY CLASS, MAYA.

11:51.344 --> 11:54.479
YOU KNOW THE ANSWER.
WHAT DID THEY DO?

11:54.481 --> 11:57.382
THEY STAYED AND BELIEVED
THINGS WOULD GET BETTER.

11:58.552 --> 12:01.119
AND THEY DID.
THEY GOT BETTER.

12:01.121 --> 12:02.487
HOW COME?

12:02.489 --> 12:04.489
BECAUSE THEY HAD HOPE.

12:05.592 --> 12:08.193
NEW ORLEANS IS ONE OF MY
FAVORITE CITIES IN THE WORLD.

12:09.329 --> 12:12.097
EVEN IN DEVASTATION,
THEY DIDN'T MISS A MARDI GRAS.

12:14.167 --> 12:15.200
THE CLOTHES LOOK NICE, MAYA.

12:16.436 --> 12:18.536
BUT IT'S THE HOPE
THAT LOOKS GREAT ON YOU.

12:26.012 --> 12:27.479
THANKS FOR COMING.

12:27.481 --> 12:29.948
YOU NEED TO STOP
BEING NICE TO ME.

12:29.950 --> 12:33.051
-YOU NEED THERAPY.
-NO KIDDING.

12:34.020 --> 12:37.055
LISTEN, I LOVE THE WAY
YOU ARE WITH MAYA

12:37.057 --> 12:39.424
AND I BELIEVE YOU
MAY EVEN BE SINCERE,

12:39.426 --> 12:41.693
BUT THERE'S NO NEED
TO BE NICE TO ME.

12:41.695 --> 12:45.330
I DON'T THINK YOU AND I
HAVE EVER EVEN HAD
A NORMAL CONVERSATION.

12:45.332 --> 12:48.533
-WHEN KERMIT LEFT ME--
-(laughing)

12:48.535 --> 12:51.736
WHAT?

12:51.737 --> 12:54.938
I'M SORRY. I NEVER PICTURED
YOUR EX-HUSBAND AS A "KERMIT".

12:56.676 --> 12:58.543
-WHEN KERMIT LEFT ME--
-(laughing)

12:58.545 --> 13:00.612
-I'M NOT EVEN SORRY.
-MM-HMM.

13:00.614 --> 13:03.648
-WHEN HE LEFT--
-WHO? WHEN WHO LEFT? WHO?

13:07.587 --> 13:09.621
I DECIDED TO SHUT
THAT PART OF ME OFF.

13:10.557 --> 13:13.291
YOU KNOW, FOOL ME ONCE,
SHAME ON YOU. FOOL ME TWICE,

13:13.293 --> 13:14.659
-SHAME ON--
-ME?

13:14.661 --> 13:16.361
SHAME ON ME? WHY?

13:16.363 --> 13:18.329
KATY, I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THIS
CONVERSATION'S COMING FROM.

13:18.331 --> 13:20.698
YOU'RE CONFUSING
YOUR AFFECTION FOR MAYA

13:20.700 --> 13:21.733
WITH AFFECTION FOR ME

13:21.735 --> 13:23.201
AND YOU DON'T
NEED TO DO THAT.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.036
WAIT. WHEN DID I
AFFECTION YOU?

13:25.038 --> 13:27.438
YOU PUT YOUR
ARM AROUND ME!

13:27.440 --> 13:29.240
OH. KATY. COME ON.

13:29.242 --> 13:33.111
SOMETIMES AN ARM AROUND
SOMEBODY IS JUST AN ARM
AROUND SOMEBODY.

13:39.286 --> 13:40.018
UM...

13:41.421 --> 13:42.987
WHAT IS THAT?

13:43.723 --> 13:45.423
-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:54.734 --> 13:56.334
(sighs) KERMIT?

13:56.336 --> 13:59.003
-TOPANGA?
-WE'RE EVEN.

13:59.639 --> 14:01.739
SEEMS LIKE IT'S GOING
PRETTY GOOD IN THERE.

14:01.741 --> 14:03.308
I'M HOPING.

14:04.778 --> 14:06.644
I KNOW WHAT THINGS MEAN.

14:06.646 --> 14:09.714
I'M A WOMAN AND
I HAVE INSTINCTS.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.716
AND YOUR CHARITY
DOES NOT EXTEND TO ME,

14:11.718 --> 14:13.685
SO YOU DON'T NEED
TO ASK ME ON A DATE--

14:13.687 --> 14:16.154
WAIT A MINUTE. ARE YOU
ASKING ME OUT ON A DATE?

14:16.156 --> 14:17.255
NO!

14:17.257 --> 14:19.657
KATY, YOU SEEM MAD
AT ME FOR NO REASON.

14:19.659 --> 14:21.659
DO YOU THINK THERE'S A CHANCE

14:21.661 --> 14:24.329
THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY MAD AT
SOMEBODY ELSE WHO'S NOT ME?

14:24.331 --> 14:27.265
I DIDN'T VIEW MY MARRIAGE
AS DISPOSABLE.

14:28.668 --> 14:30.952
I WAS ALL IN.

14:30.953 --> 14:33.237
I SAID THOSE THINGS TO HIM
IN FRONT OF GOD AND I MEANT IT.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.874
YEAH. I GET IT.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.509
I THOUGHT MY FIRST REAL
GIRLFRIEND WAS GOING TO
BE THE ONE FOREVER.

14:38.511 --> 14:40.111
I WANTED ANGELA--

14:40.113 --> 14:41.813
(scoffing) ANGELA?

14:41.815 --> 14:43.815
WHAT KIND OF NAME--

14:43.817 --> 14:46.050
NO, ANGELA'S A FINE NAME.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.585
IT'S MY MOTHER'S NAME,
ACTUALLY.

14:49.322 --> 14:53.057
I WANTED US TO BE SOME
VERSION OF CORY AND TOPANGA.

14:53.059 --> 14:54.759
BUT I GUESS THERE'S
ONLY ONE OF THOSE.

14:54.761 --> 14:56.761
KATY, RELATIONSHIPS END.

14:56.763 --> 14:59.697
SOMETIMES OUT OF NOWHERE,
ON A SUNNY DAY.

14:59.699 --> 15:04.068
BUT YOU PICK YOURSELF UP,
AND YOU REBUILD.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.136
AND YOU DON'T LOOK BACK.

15:07.741 --> 15:09.841
-KNOCK! KNOCK!
-WHO'S THERE?

15:09.843 --> 15:11.509
THE ONLY PERSON WHO
COULD CHANGE YOUR LIFE

15:11.511 --> 15:13.578
FROM THINGS ARE GOING PRETTY
GOOD RIGHT NOW TO... (shrieks)!

15:15.215 --> 15:17.615
THE ONLY PERSON WHO COULD
CHANGE MY LIFE FROM THINGS ARE
GOING PRETTY GOOD RIGHT NOW TO--

15:17.617 --> 15:18.750
-(shrieks)
-WHO?

15:22.789 --> 15:24.088
HI.

15:25.825 --> 15:26.758
ANGELA.

15:33.633 --> 15:36.768
BOY. LOOK AT YOU. YOU'RE HERE.

15:36.770 --> 15:38.269
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.881
AWKWARD.

15:49.883 --> 15:53.184
I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU
AWKWARD.

15:54.821 --> 15:57.355
HEY! REMEMBER IN HIGH SCHOOL
AND HE FOUND YOUR PURSE?

15:58.291 --> 16:00.525
REMEMBER HE GOT
HANDCUFFED IN THE BOATHOUSE?

16:00.527 --> 16:02.377
THAT WAS A GOOD ONE.

16:02.378 --> 16:04.228
REMEMBER YOU AND HIM FOR
A WHILE THEN YOU WENT AWAY?

16:04.230 --> 16:05.697
LET ME SHOW YOU
WHAT THAT LOOKED LIKE.

16:08.501 --> 16:10.234
WELL, HE'S CALMED DOWN.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.276
HI, ANGELA. I'M KATY.

16:18.278 --> 16:19.777
SHAWN SPEAKS HIGHLY OF YOU.

16:19.779 --> 16:21.813
WELL, I THINK HIGHLY OF HIM.

16:21.815 --> 16:23.381
YOU KNOW WHAT? SO DO I.

16:26.720 --> 16:29.887
WELL, I'M GOING TO
LEAVE YOU TWO ALONE.

16:39.933 --> 16:41.733
I REALLY MISSED YOU.

16:41.735 --> 16:45.303
YEAH? YOU'VE GOT A FUNNY WAY
OF LETTING SOMEONE KNOW.

16:45.305 --> 16:48.439
SHE SEEMS NICE.
SHE'S VERY PRETTY.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.942
-I'M SORRY, MAYA.
-FOR WHAT?

16:50.944 --> 16:54.879
IT'S MY FAULT.
YOU HOPE FOR THINGS
AND YOU GET SMASHED.

16:54.881 --> 16:57.281
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M WRONG. I'M SORRY.

16:57.283 --> 16:59.951
EVERYTHING WILL TURN
OUT THE WAY IT SHOULD.

16:59.953 --> 17:03.821
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?
THAT'S ANGELA.
SHE'S GOING TO TAKE HIM AWAY.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.957
-I'M NOT GIVING UP HOPE YET.
-WHY NOT?

17:05.959 --> 17:07.625
I JUST GOT IT.

17:16.503 --> 17:18.269
HELLO!

17:22.909 --> 17:24.976
WELL, DID YOU HEAR
MY DAD DIED?

17:24.978 --> 17:27.979
OH, NO, ANGELA.
I'M SO SORRY.

17:27.981 --> 17:32.650
(sighs)
A MILITARY MAN. A WAR HERO
AND HE DIES FISHING.

17:33.620 --> 17:35.820
-I LIKED HIM.
-OH, HE LIKED YOU.

17:36.890 --> 17:37.955
BYE!

17:40.760 --> 17:42.593
YOU KNOW I THINK
ABOUT HIM EVERY DAY.

17:43.530 --> 17:45.430
HEY! DO YOU STILL
HAVE THAT THING

17:45.432 --> 17:48.800
WHERE YOU CAN FEEL YOUR DAD
STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO YOU?

17:48.802 --> 17:49.867
I DO.

17:49.869 --> 17:53.604
YEAH, HE WAS BARELY THERE
FOR ME WHEN HE WAS ALIVE,

17:53.606 --> 17:56.841
BUT NOW THAT HE'S GONE,
I CAN ABSOLUTELY DEPEND ON HIM

17:56.843 --> 17:59.277
TO SHOW UP AT THE MOST
IMPORTANT TIMES OF MY LIFE.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.080
ANGELA. WHY ARE YOU HERE?

18:03.083 --> 18:04.916
I NEED SOMEONE TO TALK TO.

18:04.918 --> 18:08.453
-IT CAN ONLY BE YOU.
HOW ABOUT THAT?
-OKAY.

18:08.455 --> 18:10.021
WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS?

18:10.924 --> 18:12.857
WELL, WE'VE GOT
A STORM GOING ON,

18:12.859 --> 18:15.593
SO A HURRICANE PICNIC.

18:25.371 --> 18:26.370
WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:27.507 --> 18:28.639
I'M MARRIED NOW.

18:29.976 --> 18:31.609
Maya: YAY!

18:32.846 --> 18:33.878
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN MARRIED?

18:33.880 --> 18:36.047
FOUR YEARS.
HE'S A MILITARY MAN.

18:36.049 --> 18:38.049
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME?

18:38.051 --> 18:39.417
I WASN'T READY.

18:39.419 --> 18:40.818
AND THEN YOU WERE?

18:40.820 --> 18:42.720
WELL, LIFE GOES ON, SHAWN.

18:42.722 --> 18:45.323
YOU KNOW, I THINK LIFE PUTS
PEOPLE IN FRONT OF US,

18:45.325 --> 18:48.526
SO THAT WE CAN BE PREPARED
FOR WHAT COMES NEXT.

18:48.528 --> 18:50.061
I WAS READY BECAUSE OF YOU.

18:50.063 --> 18:52.296
I HOPE LIFE KNOWS
WHAT IT'S DOING.

18:59.572 --> 19:00.738
WHY DID YOU COME SEE ME?

19:00.740 --> 19:04.809
OKAY. MY HUSBAND
WANTS TO HAVE CHILDREN.

19:04.811 --> 19:10.648
AND YOU KNOW THAT
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN SCARED
OF BEING SOMEBODY'S MOTHER

19:10.650 --> 19:11.916
BECAUSE MY OWN
MOTHER LEFT.

19:11.918 --> 19:14.552
YEAH, WE WERE BOTH
BROKEN THAT WAY.

19:14.554 --> 19:18.589
YEAH, NOW HE'S TRYING
TO CONVINCE ME THAT
I'D BE A GOOD ONE

19:18.591 --> 19:24.028
AND I NEED SOMEBODY WHO
UNDERSTANDS ME TO TELL ME
IF THAT COULD BE TRUE.

19:25.565 --> 19:26.898
I MEAN, I CAN'T
TALK TO MY FATHER.

19:26.900 --> 19:29.600
HE DOESN'T JUST SHOW UP
FOR ME LIKE YOURS DOES.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.370
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
I CAN TRUST WITH THIS.

19:33.606 --> 19:35.473
HAVE KIDS, ANGELA.

19:37.076 --> 19:39.510
PUT MORE OF YOU
IN THE WORLD.

19:39.512 --> 19:42.880
AND THEN SIT IN A CHAIR
AND WATCH THEM.

19:44.017 --> 19:45.049
YOU'D BE AMAZED.

19:47.086 --> 19:48.819
WE'RE HERE TO MAKE
SOMEBODY ELSE HAPPY.

19:49.756 --> 19:50.888
THANK YOU, SHAWN.

19:51.891 --> 19:55.092
I KNEW I COULD COUNT ON YOU
TO TELL ME WHAT'S RIGHT.

19:55.094 --> 19:56.527
HEY, CAN I TELL YOU
SOMETHING RIGHT?

19:56.529 --> 19:57.662
I WISH SOMEBODY WOULD.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.368
WHO'S THAT?

20:04.370 --> 20:05.670
IT'S MAYA.

20:06.739 --> 20:09.907
SHE HAS NOT TAKEN HER EYES
OFF YOU SINCE I WALKED IN.

20:09.909 --> 20:12.009
YEAH. SHE'S SOMEBODY
I'VE GROWN VERY FOND OF.

20:14.147 --> 20:15.980
AND THAT'S HER MOTHER?

20:18.885 --> 20:20.084
KATY, YEAH.
THAT'S HER MOM.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.955
MMM. IS SHE THE ONE?

20:23.957 --> 20:25.456
WHAT? NO.

20:25.458 --> 20:27.992
-IS SHE THE ONE, SHAWN?
-NO.

20:27.994 --> 20:30.561
I DON'T KNOW.

20:30.563 --> 20:32.863
I DON'T KNOW HER ENOUGH
TO KNOW ANYTHING.

20:32.865 --> 20:35.833
WELL, LET ME TELL
YOU WHAT'S RIGHT.

20:35.835 --> 20:39.070
LET WHAT WE HAD MAKE
YOU READY FOR SOMETHING.

20:45.011 --> 20:46.777
LIFE KNOWS
WHAT IT'S DOING.

21:10.470 --> 21:11.802
WHAT'S THIS FOR?

21:12.939 --> 21:14.071
NOTHING.

21:14.073 --> 21:15.606
EVERYTHING.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.177
I THINK WE'RE CUTE TOGETHER.

21:22.915 --> 21:24.081
I KNOW.

21:30.690 --> 21:32.657
HOW'S IT GOING
IN THERE, SUPER SPY?

21:33.660 --> 21:37.662
IT'S BAD, MAN.
I THINK SHE'S UP TO
ABOUT A MILLION DOLLARS.

21:41.100 --> 21:42.466
I DON'T REALLY
LIKE ANY OF IT.

21:42.468 --> 21:43.701
(laughing)

21:47.573 --> 21:48.756
WHO'S BETTER THAN YOU?

21:48.757 --> 21:49.940
-HEY, CAN I BUY YOU AN OUTFIT?
-HE'S REALLY GOOD AT IT.

21:49.942 --> 21:52.243
NO, NO, YOU CAN'T
BUY ME ANYTHING.

21:52.245 --> 21:53.844
WE HARDLY KNOW EACH OTHER.

21:53.846 --> 21:56.147
(chuckles) ARE YOU
ASKING ME OUT ON A DATE?

21:57.517 --> 21:58.749
YEAH.

22:00.019 --> 22:01.218
WAIT. WHAT? SERIOUSLY?

22:03.723 --> 22:05.489
RIGHT HERE IN FRONT
OF EVERYBODY?

22:06.759 --> 22:08.559
SURE.

22:08.561 --> 22:10.761
IT WOULD BE REAL BAD
FOR ME IF YOU SAID NO.

22:12.598 --> 22:14.732
-UNCLE SHAWN?
-YEAH?

22:14.734 --> 22:17.268
THIS IS, LIKE,
A REAL IMPORTANT
MOMENT IN YOUR LIFE.

22:19.906 --> 22:21.038
YEAH, I THINK IT IS.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.907
HOW'RE YOU GONNA
HANDLE THIS, ACE?

22:25.044 --> 22:27.011
I'LL TELL YOU HOW YOU'RE
GONNA HANDLE IT, SON.

22:29.549 --> 22:32.149
YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THAT
TOUGH LITTLE GIRL'S FACE.

22:34.153 --> 22:37.054
YOU KNOW WHAT SHE'S DOIN'?

22:37.055 --> 22:39.956
SHE'S LETTING HER GUARD DOWN
JUST ENOUGH TO LET YOU KNOW
SHE CARES ABOUT YOU.

22:39.959 --> 22:41.826
SO, HOW YOU'RE
GONNA HANDLE THAT IS,

22:41.828 --> 22:46.130
YOU GOTTA DECIDE RIGHT NOW
WHAT THAT MEANS TO YOU.

22:48.134 --> 22:50.801
AND THEN TAKE A LOOK
AT HER SCREWBALL MOTHER.

22:54.207 --> 22:56.307
DO YOURSELF A FAVOR

22:56.309 --> 23:00.211
AND NOTICE HOW SHE
MIGHT BE WONDERFUL, TOO.

23:00.213 --> 23:01.779
YOU GONNA LEAVE ME
HANGIN' OR WHAT?

23:01.781 --> 23:03.781
AND FINALLY,

23:04.917 --> 23:06.250
TRUST ME,

23:07.253 --> 23:09.286
TAKE A LOOK AT THE
EXPRESSION ON THEM
TWO FACES.

23:10.189 --> 23:11.122
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS?

23:12.158 --> 23:14.058
HOPE.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.127
FUNNY THING IS, THEY
COULD USE JUST ABOUT

23:16.129 --> 23:18.596
EXACTLY AS MUCH
OF IT AS YOU CAN.

23:20.032 --> 23:21.599
SHAWN.

23:21.601 --> 23:24.869
IF THAT LITTLE GIRL
CAN LET HER GUARD DOWN,

23:24.871 --> 23:26.203
WHY CAN'T YOU?

23:36.849 --> 23:40.785
MAYA? WOULD IT BE
OKAY WITH YOU IF I--

23:40.787 --> 23:41.786
OKAY. LET IT OUT.

23:41.788 --> 23:45.689
YAY!

23:50.596 --> 23:53.364
KATY, I-- I WOULD LOVE TO
GO ON A DATE WITH YOU.

23:53.366 --> 23:54.231
THANKS FOR ASKING.

23:58.037 --> 23:59.370
THAT'S MY BOY.
