00:29.027 --> 00:29.593
Oh, hello.

00:29.628 --> 00:31.530
You're, uh, you're probably here

00:31.565 --> 00:33.649
About the, Uh, the story.

00:33.684 --> 00:35.699
Elves love to tell stories.

00:35.734 --> 00:38.537
I- I'll bet you didn't know that
about elves.

00:38.572 --> 00:40.856
There's, uh, probably a lot of things

00:40.891 --> 00:43.105
You... you didn't know about elves.

00:43.140 --> 00:47.810
Another... another interesting
Uh, elf ism

00:47.845 --> 00:53.250
Uh, there are only three jobs available
to an elf.

00:53.285 --> 00:54.902
The first is making shoes at night

00:54.937 --> 00:56.520
While, you know, while the old...

00:56.555 --> 00:58.154
The old cobbler sleeps.

00:58.189 --> 01:01.225
Lazy bum. Couldn't even make a clog.

01:01.260 --> 01:02.860
You can bake cookies

01:02.895 --> 01:03.659
In a tree. Hey!

01:03.694 --> 01:06.796
As you can imagine, it's, uh, dangerous
Having an oven

01:06.831 --> 01:09.265
In an oak tree during the dry season.

01:09.300 --> 01:10.999
I wanna make shoes!

01:11.034 --> 01:13.570
But the third job... uh, some call
It, uh,

01:13.605 --> 01:15.804
"The show," or... or "the big dance,"

01:15.839 --> 01:19.959
It's the profession that every elf
Aspires to,

01:19.994 --> 01:24.080
And that is to build toys in
Santa's workshop.

01:24.115 --> 01:26.310
Only two weeks left till Christmas!

01:26.850 --> 01:29.818
I- It's a job only an elf can do.

01:29.853 --> 01:31.237
Our... our nimble fingers,

01:31.272 --> 01:33.014
Natural cheer and active minds

01:33.049 --> 01:34.722
Are perfect for toy-building.

01:34.757 --> 01:37.726
They... they tried using gnomes
And trolls,

01:37.761 --> 01:40.593
But the gnomes drank too much...

01:42.131 --> 01:44.929
...and the trolls weren't toilet
trained.

01:45.401 --> 01:50.572
No human being has ever set... set
foot in Santa's workshop.

01:50.607 --> 01:53.375
Uh, that is until about 30 years ago,

01:53.410 --> 01:56.360
And, as you may have guessed,

01:56.395 --> 01:59.312
That's where our story begins.

02:31.411 --> 02:32.878
Wow!

02:35.649 --> 02:37.207
Whoa!

03:13.685 --> 03:15.253
Ooh!

03:15.288 --> 03:16.850
Wow!

03:16.885 --> 03:18.413
Wow!

03:26.231 --> 03:29.496
Ow! Ow!

03:43.480 --> 03:44.879
Whoa!

03:47.784 --> 03:49.979
Are you sleepy?

03:51.021 --> 03:51.753
Here we are.

03:51.788 --> 03:56.359
We're just going to make you feel
so comfortable.

03:56.394 --> 03:58.428
Here we are.

03:58.463 --> 04:00.428
There you are.

04:00.463 --> 04:03.664
It's time to go to sleep.

04:03.699 --> 04:07.226
Maybe by next Christmas you'll
Have a home.

04:13.543 --> 04:17.502
Merry Christmas, my ángel.

04:44.072 --> 04:46.904
Mmm...

05:25.545 --> 05:28.279
All right, all right.

05:28.314 --> 05:31.818
We've had another very successful
year.

05:33.619 --> 05:36.204
So, after all that hard work,

05:36.239 --> 05:38.790
It's time to start preparations

05:38.825 --> 05:40.425
For next Christmas!

05:49.301 --> 05:53.965
What in the name of Sam hill
Is that?

05:55.340 --> 05:57.807
Wow...

06:00.544 --> 06:02.842
A baby...

06:05.483 --> 06:07.817
"little buddy diapers."

06:07.852 --> 06:09.952
His name is buddy. He must've...

06:09.987 --> 06:12.356
Snuck into your sack at the
orphanage.

06:12.391 --> 06:12.822
What do we do?

06:12.857 --> 06:15.992
So, Santa had a
Decision to make,

06:16.027 --> 06:18.129
And fortunately, when it
Comes to babies,

06:18.164 --> 06:19.428
Santa's a... a pushover.

06:19.463 --> 06:21.665
So, buddy stayed with, uh
An older elf

06:21.700 --> 06:22.597
Who had always wanted a child?

06:22.632 --> 06:25.168
But had been so committed to
Building toys, he...

06:25.203 --> 06:30.006
He, well, had forgotten to
Settle down.

06:30.041 --> 06:30.605
Santa.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.877
Yes, yes, I... I raised buddy.

06:33.912 --> 06:36.111
I was his adopted father.

06:36.146 --> 06:37.846
Though buddy grew twice as fast,

06:37.881 --> 06:42.085
He... he wasn't any different from
the other children.

06:42.120 --> 06:44.755
Chuckles not too fast, buddy.

06:44.790 --> 06:47.354
I mean, not... not really.

06:47.389 --> 06:49.274
Before we learn how to build
The latest

06:49.309 --> 06:51.602
In extreme graphic chipset
Processors,

06:51.637 --> 06:53.896
Let's recite the
"Code of the elves,"

06:53.931 --> 06:54.764
Shall we?

06:54.799 --> 06:55.562
Number one.

06:55.597 --> 06:58.567
"Treat every day like Christmas."

06:58.602 --> 06:59.333
Number two.

06:59.368 --> 07:03.372
"There's room for everyone on the
Nice list."

07:03.407 --> 07:04.471
Number three.

07:04.506 --> 07:07.876
"The best way to spread Christmas
Cheer

07:07.911 --> 07:11.709
Is singing loud for all to hear."

07:11.946 --> 07:14.582
And one day, when buddy was
old enough,

07:14.617 --> 07:16.785
I made him my own personal
apprentice.

07:16.820 --> 07:18.871
I've never been in this room
before.

07:18.906 --> 07:20.922
Well, I think it's time you start

07:20.957 --> 07:22.890
Your tinker training.

07:23.558 --> 07:26.926
Santa's sleigh.

07:26.961 --> 07:29.589
You're gonna help me make it fly.

07:31.399 --> 07:33.701
I thought the magical reindeer made
The sleighs fly.

07:33.736 --> 07:36.503
And where do the reindeer get
their magic from?

07:36.538 --> 07:41.007
Christmas spirit. Everybody
knows that.

07:41.042 --> 07:43.093
Well, silly as it sounds,

07:43.128 --> 07:45.104
A lot of people down south

07:45.139 --> 07:47.080
Don't believe in Santa Claus.

07:47.115 --> 07:48.880
What?!

07:48.915 --> 07:52.119
Well, who do they think puts all?
their toys under the tree?

07:52.154 --> 07:54.055
Well, there's a rumor floating around

07:54.090 --> 07:55.956
That, uh, that the parents do it.

07:55.991 --> 07:57.889
That's... that's ridiculous.

07:57.924 --> 08:00.926
I mean, parents couldn't do that
all in one night.

08:00.961 --> 08:02.026
What about Santa's cookies?

08:02.061 --> 08:04.497
I suppose parents eat them, too?

08:04.532 --> 08:05.563
Yeah, I, uh, I... I know,

08:05.598 --> 08:08.067
Uh, and every earless and less
People

08:08.102 --> 08:08.733
Believe in Santa Claus.

08:08.768 --> 08:12.204
I mean, we have a real energy
crisis on our hands.

08:12.239 --> 08:12.670
Oh.

08:12.705 --> 08:16.642
I mean, just see how low the, uh
Claus meter is.

08:16.677 --> 08:18.444
That's shocking.

08:18.479 --> 08:20.177
That's why I came up

08:20.212 --> 08:22.615
With this little beauty in the '60s.

08:27.218 --> 08:28.451
WH-what is it?

08:28.486 --> 08:29.953
It's a cringle 3000...

08:29.988 --> 08:33.658
A 500-reindeer power jet turbine
engine.

08:33.693 --> 08:35.158
Without it, the sleigh couldn't

08:35.193 --> 08:39.129
Get more than, uh, a few feet off
the ground.

08:40.999 --> 08:42.549
Well, it looks like we got

08:42.585 --> 08:44.594
A short in the thermo coupler.

08:44.629 --> 08:46.604
You wanna give mea hand with that?

08:46.639 --> 08:48.070
You want me to help?

08:48.105 --> 08:50.474
As much as, uh, buddy was accepted

08:50.509 --> 08:52.643
By his family and friends,

08:52.678 --> 08:54.743
There were a few drawbacks

08:54.778 --> 08:58.549
To being, uh, a human in, uh
an elf's world.

09:19.635 --> 09:21.737
Hey, Ming Ming.

09:21.772 --> 09:22.703
Um...

09:22.738 --> 09:27.109
I'm gonna be a little bit short
on today's quota.

09:27.144 --> 09:28.142
It's all right, buddy.

09:28.177 --> 09:29.712
Just how many etch-a-sketches

09:29.747 --> 09:32.983
Did you get finished?

09:33.018 --> 09:36.218
Come on, buddy. How many?

09:36.253 --> 09:40.518
I made, uh... 85.

09:46.027 --> 09:48.086
Eighty-five?

09:48.763 --> 09:50.628
That puts you...

09:51.333 --> 09:52.566
915 off the pace.

09:52.601 --> 09:54.134
Ooh... that's bad.

09:54.169 --> 09:55.535
Why don't you just say it?

09:55.570 --> 09:58.089
I'm the worst toy maker in
the world.

09:58.124 --> 10:00.608
I'm a cotton-headed ninny-muggins.

10:01.175 --> 10:04.044
No, buddy, you're not cotton-
headed ninny-muggins.

10:04.079 --> 10:07.147
We all just have different talents
That's all.

10:07.182 --> 10:08.047
Seems like everyone else

10:08.082 --> 10:09.515
Have the same talents
except for me.

10:09.550 --> 10:12.353
You... you have, you have lots of
Talents, uh...

10:12.388 --> 10:15.890
Special talents in fact, like
Um, uh...

10:15.925 --> 10:16.655
Special talents?

10:16.690 --> 10:19.393
You changed the batteries in the
smoke detector.

10:19.428 --> 10:20.159
You sure did... aaa's.

10:20.194 --> 10:23.397
And in six months, you'll have
to check 'em again...

10:23.432 --> 10:24.129
Won't he?

10:24.164 --> 10:26.866
And you're the only baritone in
the elf choir.

10:26.901 --> 10:29.102
You bring us down whole octave.

10:29.137 --> 10:30.437
In a good way.

10:30.472 --> 10:31.703
See, buddy?

10:31.738 --> 10:33.907
You're not a cotton-headed ninny-
muggings.

10:33.942 --> 10:37.741
You're just... special.

10:38.311 --> 10:43.716
And so, buddy was sent where the...
The special elves work.

10:43.751 --> 10:45.877
Aah!

10:57.262 --> 10:59.765
Ah!

11:21.185 --> 11:21.684
Hey, foom foom...

11:21.719 --> 11:24.004
I hate to do this to you, but you
Think you could

11:24.039 --> 11:26.290
Help me pick up the slack on those
etch-a-sketches?

11:26.325 --> 11:28.426
No problem. I appreciate it.

11:28.461 --> 11:29.091
Buddy is killing me.

11:29.126 --> 11:32.730
I already got lum lum and choochoo pulling' doubles.

11:32.765 --> 11:34.282
That was quick thinking yesterday

11:34.317 --> 11:35.725
With that ¡°special talents¡± thing.

11:35.760 --> 11:37.048
I feel bad for the guy.

11:37.082 --> 11:38.300
I just hope he doesn't get wise.

11:38.335 --> 11:41.938
Well, if he hasn't figured out
He's a human by now,

11:41.973 --> 11:44.304
I don't think he ever will.

11:47.944 --> 11:50.625
If he hasn't figured
Out he's a human

11:50.660 --> 11:53.306
By now, I don't think he ever will.

11:54.317 --> 11:57.218
I think they're too small.

11:58.855 --> 12:03.154
You're just... special.

12:20.743 --> 12:22.945
You don't look so good, buddy.

12:22.980 --> 12:23.444
Are you okay?

12:23.479 --> 12:26.981
I'll be okay, I just need a glass
of water.

12:27.016 --> 12:29.176
Aah!

12:29.717 --> 12:32.208
Buddy...

12:33.287 --> 12:35.482
Unh! Aah!

12:52.706 --> 12:54.741
Buddy, are you okay?

12:54.776 --> 12:56.742
I'm sorry, papa.

12:56.777 --> 12:59.177
I just need some alone time.

12:59.212 --> 13:01.782
Buddy, I... I think we... we have
to talk.

13:01.817 --> 13:04.936
Buddy, uh, I think there's something

13:04.971 --> 13:08.020
I... I probably should tell you.

13:08.055 --> 13:11.525
You probably should have found
out a long...

13:11.560 --> 13:12.691
A long time ago.

13:12.726 --> 13:15.761
I then proceeded to tell buddy of
how his father

13:15.796 --> 13:18.698
Had fallen in love when he was
very young

13:18.733 --> 13:21.600
With a beautiful girl named
Susan wells,

13:21.635 --> 13:22.733
And how buddy was born

13:22.768 --> 13:25.271
And put up for adoption by
his mother,

13:25.306 --> 13:28.240
And how she had later passed away.

13:28.275 --> 13:29.240
I... I told him his father

13:29.275 --> 13:31.777
Had never even known that
Buddy was born,

13:31.812 --> 13:32.543
And most importantly,

13:32.578 --> 13:34.478
I told him where his father was...

13:34.513 --> 13:38.583
Uh, in a magical land called
new York City.

13:38.618 --> 13:40.950
My dad works there?

13:40.985 --> 13:43.282
Empire state building.

13:47.492 --> 13:49.894
Hey, buddy, wanna pick some
snow berries?

13:49.929 --> 13:52.761
Not now, arctic puffin.

13:53.998 --> 13:56.500
Hello, buddy. Oh... hi, Leon.

13:56.535 --> 13:59.421
Why the long face, partner?

13:59.456 --> 14:01.715
It seems I'm... I'm not an elf.

14:01.750 --> 14:04.363
'Course you're not. You're 6'3"

14:04.398 --> 14:06.977
And had a beard since you were 15.

14:07.012 --> 14:08.077
Papa says my real father

14:08.112 --> 14:11.281
Lives in a magical place far away.

14:11.316 --> 14:12.349
I don't know what to do.

14:12.384 --> 14:13.348
At least you have a daddy.

14:13.383 --> 14:17.588
I was just rolled up one day and
left out here in the cold.

14:17.623 --> 14:20.290
But the thing is, I've never even left
the North Pole.

14:20.325 --> 14:22.676
Buddy, I've been around the world
Many times

14:22.711 --> 14:24.993
When I was a young cumulus
nimbus cloud.

14:25.028 --> 14:28.898
It's a wonderful place, filled with
Wondrous creatures...

14:28.933 --> 14:29.397
Except dogs.

14:29.432 --> 14:32.301
Oh, by the way, don't eat the
yellow snow.

14:32.336 --> 14:32.900
Oh, I know that.

14:32.935 --> 14:37.006
All I'm say in' is, this might be
The golden opportunity

14:37.041 --> 14:39.804
To find out whom you really are.

14:42.678 --> 14:44.946
So, I hear you're going

14:44.981 --> 14:47.917
On a little journey to
the big city.

14:47.952 --> 14:49.083
Yup. Ahh.

14:49.118 --> 14:50.353
I'm kind a nervous.

14:50.987 --> 14:52.954
Leon says New York is pretty
different.

14:52.989 --> 14:53.987
Oh, don't pay attention to Leon.

14:54.022 --> 14:57.993
He's never been anywhere.
He doesn't have any feet.

14:58.028 --> 15:00.629
I've been to New York thousands
of times.

15:00.664 --> 15:01.647
Really? Mm-hmm.

15:01.682 --> 15:02.596
What's it like?

15:02.631 --> 15:05.467
Well, there are some things you
should know.

15:05.502 --> 15:08.070
First off, you see gum on
The street,

15:08.105 --> 15:10.639
Leave it there. It's not
free candy.

15:10.674 --> 15:11.838
Oh. Second,

15:11.873 --> 15:14.425
There are, like, 30 ray's
pizzas.

15:14.460 --> 15:16.977
They all claim to be the
Original,

15:17.012 --> 15:18.611
But the real one' son 11th.

15:18.646 --> 15:21.248
And if you see a sign that
Says "peep show,"

15:21.283 --> 15:23.851
That doesn't mean that
They're letting you

15:23.886 --> 15:27.121
Look at presents before Christmas.

15:27.156 --> 15:27.920
Can't wait to see my dad...

15:27.955 --> 15:31.425
We're gonna go ices skating and...
And eat sugar plums.

15:31.460 --> 15:33.745
Yeah, that's the other thing

15:33.780 --> 15:36.840
I wanted to talk to you about.

15:36.875 --> 15:39.455
You know, buddy...

15:39.490 --> 15:42.000
Your father...

15:42.035 --> 15:45.438
Well... he's on the naughty list.

15:45.473 --> 15:48.930
No!

15:49.876 --> 15:54.047
You're taking the books back?

15:55.048 --> 15:57.383
See, I... I see what you're trying
to do here.

15:57.418 --> 15:59.236
Y- You're trying to make me feel bad,

15:59.271 --> 16:01.054
When, in actuality, you're the one

16:01.089 --> 16:02.086
That missed the payments.

16:02.121 --> 16:06.058
But the children love the books.

16:06.093 --> 16:06.890
I know that, uh...

16:06.925 --> 16:09.194
You know, I'm the one that ran
The focus groups,

16:09.229 --> 16:10.661
But I like hearing that.

16:10.696 --> 16:14.066
Listen, some people, they just
Lose sight

16:14.101 --> 16:15.866
Of what's important in life.

16:15.901 --> 16:21.707
That doesn't mean they can't find
their way again, huh?

16:21.742 --> 16:22.539
Maybe all they need

16:22.574 --> 16:25.210
Is just a little Christmas spirit.

16:28.180 --> 16:30.715
Well, uh, I... I'm good at that.

16:30.750 --> 16:33.206
I know you are.

16:45.029 --> 16:46.929
And I'll...

16:46.964 --> 16:47.663
I'll always, uh,

16:47.698 --> 16:50.724
I'll always be here for you.

16:57.173 --> 16:59.604
Now, uh...

16:59.639 --> 17:02.035
Go... uh, get.

17:12.989 --> 17:13.722
Bye, guys.

17:13.757 --> 17:17.027
Bye, buddy. Bye, buddy. Take care.

17:17.061 --> 17:19.017
Bye-bye.

17:20.663 --> 17:22.262
Bye-bye.

17:22.298 --> 17:23.531
Bye-bye, buddy.

17:25.634 --> 17:27.226
There, there.

17:29.505 --> 17:31.404
Huh?

17:31.439 --> 17:33.304
Oh! Ohh!

17:36.045 --> 17:39.214
Bye, buddy. Hope you find your dad.

17:39.249 --> 17:41.205
Thanks, Mr. Narwhal.

17:42.016 --> 17:43.483
Bye.

18:34.066 --> 18:36.569
Hey! What's your name?

18:36.604 --> 18:39.299
My name's buddy.

18:42.541 --> 18:43.838
Ohh!

18:46.345 --> 18:48.347
Does someone need a hug?

18:52.251 --> 18:55.086
aah, aah! That's not cool!

18:56.187 --> 18:58.280
I just wanted a hug!

19:39.263 --> 19:40.828
Hi.

19:40.863 --> 19:42.394
Hello.

19:48.838 --> 19:50.734
Thank you.

19:50.769 --> 19:52.631
Thank you.

19:58.948 --> 20:02.116
You did it! Congratulations!

20:02.151 --> 20:07.123
"World's best cup of coffee.
"Great job, everybody.

20:07.158 --> 20:09.858
It's great to meet you.

20:09.893 --> 20:11.416
Hi.

20:22.737 --> 20:25.440
Santa, san... uh, nope.

20:25.475 --> 20:27.159
Not Santa.

20:27.194 --> 20:28.781
Thank you.

20:28.816 --> 20:30.368
Thank you.

21:17.690 --> 21:19.726
Thank you. Hey, you know what?
No.

21:19.761 --> 21:21.158
No, all right? Thank you.

21:21.193 --> 21:23.718
Get outta here, get outta here.

21:58.529 --> 22:00.676
Hello. Hi.

22:00.711 --> 22:02.824
Ooh...

22:04.869 --> 22:08.770
Beautiful.

22:18.982 --> 22:21.542
Looks like a Christmas tree.

22:22.852 --> 22:24.886
A reprint?

22:24.921 --> 22:26.790
You know how much that's gonna
cost?

22:26.825 --> 22:27.956
Two whole pages are missing.

22:27.991 --> 22:29.224
The story doesn't make any sense.

22:29.259 --> 22:31.511
What, you think some kid's gonna
notice two pages?

22:31.546 --> 22:33.762
I mean, they... all they do is look
at pictures.

22:35.397 --> 22:38.083
Sorry I can't ride with you the
Rest of the way up,

22:38.118 --> 22:40.769
But this is where my dad works.
Well, have a good...

22:40.804 --> 22:42.002
Oh, I forgot to give you a hug!

22:42.037 --> 22:43.973
Oh, I don't know, Connie,
I've never

22:44.008 --> 22:45.441
Declared kittens before.

22:45.476 --> 22:46.407
How many?

22:46.442 --> 22:47.942
Eight?

22:47.977 --> 22:49.877
Uh, I don't know if I'm gonna
Have time.

22:49.912 --> 22:52.364
Oh, all right, just bring 'em by
The camper this week,

22:52.399 --> 22:54.817
And I'll see what I can do. I'm
Not gonna charge you.

22:54.852 --> 22:57.318
Just bring 'em by, and I'll see
What I can do.

22:57.353 --> 22:59.052
I have to go. Excuse me.

22:59.087 --> 23:02.457
I'm here to see a Walter hobs.

23:02.492 --> 23:03.923
I'm buddy the elf. Laughs

23:03.958 --> 23:07.528
You look hilarious! Who sent you?

23:07.563 --> 23:09.495
Papa elf. Papa elf?

23:09.530 --> 23:11.248
Mm-hmm. From the North Pole.

23:11.283 --> 23:12.932
From the North Pole? Yes.

23:12.967 --> 23:15.686
So, you really think we should
Ship 'em?

23:15.721 --> 23:18.048
No, I think we should take a
$30,000 bath

23:18.083 --> 23:20.375
So some kid can understand
What happened?

23:20.410 --> 23:22.042
To a puppy and a frigging pigeon

23:22.077 --> 23:23.961
ship 'em.

23:23.996 --> 23:25.811
Yeah.

23:25.846 --> 23:28.582
Mr. Hobbs? It's me on the intercom.

23:28.617 --> 23:28.981
Go ahead.

23:29.016 --> 23:32.611
Yeah, I think some one sent you a
Christmas-gram.

23:33.854 --> 23:35.321
Dad!

23:38.392 --> 23:41.211
All right, uh, let's get it
Over with.

23:41.246 --> 23:43.996
I walked all day and night to
Find you.

23:44.031 --> 23:46.966
Uh, you look like you came from
the North Pole.

23:47.500 --> 23:49.635
That's exactly where I came from.

23:49.670 --> 23:51.321
Santa must've called you!

23:51.356 --> 23:52.937
Oh, yeah, sure, he, uh...

23:52.972 --> 23:54.874
Just got off the cell phone
with me.

23:54.909 --> 23:56.140
You did?!

23:56.175 --> 23:58.609
So, go on. Go on with what?

23:58.644 --> 24:00.880
Well, are... are you gonna sing a
Song or something,

24:00.915 --> 24:02.648
Or can I just go back to work?

24:02.683 --> 24:05.516
A song? Uh...

24:05.551 --> 24:10.955
Yeah. Anything for you, dad, uh...

24:10.990 --> 24:16.361
I... I'm, I'm here with my dad

24:16.396 --> 24:17.127
And we never met

24:17.162 --> 24:20.999
And he wants me to sing
Him a song

24:21.034 --> 24:22.499
And, um, I was adopted

24:22.534 --> 24:24.868
But you didn't know I was born

24:24.903 --> 24:29.374
So, I'm here now, I found you,
Daddy

24:29.409 --> 24:31.676
And, guess what? I love you

24:31.711 --> 24:35.475
I love you I love you!

24:36.880 --> 24:38.681
Wow, that was weird.

24:38.716 --> 24:41.552
You know, usually you guys just
Uh, you know,

24:41.587 --> 24:44.388
Put my name into jingle bells or
something.

24:44.423 --> 24:45.154
It's me, your son.

24:45.189 --> 24:48.425
Susan wells had me, and... And she
Didn't tell you,

24:48.460 --> 24:50.928
And, and, and, but now I'm here...

24:50.963 --> 24:52.180
It's me buddy.

24:52.215 --> 24:53.362
Susan wells.

24:53.397 --> 24:56.696
Uh, you said Susan wells? Yes.

24:57.101 --> 24:58.966
Who sent this Christmas-gram?

24:59.001 --> 25:01.137
What's a Christmas-gram?
I want one.

25:06.008 --> 25:08.460
It's okay, Walter's my father.

25:08.495 --> 25:10.913
Well, your dad's busy right now.

25:10.948 --> 25:12.146
Okay, I'll come back later.

You're gonna go back to
Santa land.

25:16.754 --> 25:17.185
Okay.

25:17.220 --> 25:20.485
Yeah, why don't you go back?
to gimbals'?

25:38.640 --> 25:41.234
Sorry! Sorry.

Fruit spray? Sure.

Sorry.

26:19.479 --> 26:20.776
Sorry.

Do you wanna go?

26:41.333 --> 26:44.036
Hey! Have you seen these?

26:44.071 --> 26:46.732
They're gl-normous!

26:47.639 --> 26:50.608
"For that special someone."

26:53.812 --> 26:55.213
Past!

27:06.824 --> 27:09.594
You're not supposed to be
Down here!

27:09.629 --> 27:10.793
You can shop on your break,

27:10.828 --> 27:12.662
You don't... come on, get upstairs!

27:12.697 --> 27:15.533
Okay, I didn't know. Well
You should know!

Okay, fair enough.

27:20.873 --> 27:23.105

27:26.010 --> 27:27.594
No, it's not. Yes, it is.

27:27.629 --> 27:29.171

No, it isn't. Yes, it is.

27:32.282 --> 27:35.217
No, it's not. Where's the snow?

27:35.785 --> 27:36.718
Why you smiling like that?

27:36.753 --> 27:39.254
I just like to smile, smiling's
my favorite.

27:39.289 --> 27:42.058
Make work your favorite, that's
You're favorite, okay?

27:42.093 --> 27:43.894
Okay. Work is your new favorite.

27:43.929 --> 27:44.526
Fine.

27:44.561 --> 27:46.329
It's time for the announcement.

27:46.364 --> 27:46.761
Okay.

27:46.796 --> 27:49.865
Okay, people, tomorrow

27:49.900 --> 27:51.367
Santa's coming' to town!

27:51.402 --> 27:52.833
Santa!

27:52.868 --> 27:54.301
Oh, my god!

27:54.336 --> 27:58.741
Santa here?! I know him.

27:58.776 --> 27:59.573
I know him.

27:59.608 --> 28:01.076
He'll be hereto take pictures

28:01.111 --> 28:02.578
With all the children.

28:02.613 --> 28:03.043
Yeah!

28:03.078 --> 28:05.714
Just keep your receipts.
10 a.m. Tomorrow.

28:05.749 --> 28:06.680
10 a.m. Tomorrow.

28:06.715 --> 28:07.815
Santa's coming to town.

28:07.850 --> 28:09.885
Yes. Can you sign this for me?

28:09.920 --> 28:12.621
Ohh! Hi.

28:34.275 --> 28:35.408
Are you enjoying the view?

28:35.443 --> 28:38.712
You are very good at decorating
that tree.

28:38.747 --> 28:40.731
Why are you messing with me?

28:40.766 --> 28:42.716
Did krumpet put you up to this?

28:42.751 --> 28:44.116
I'm not messing with you.

28:44.151 --> 28:46.136
It's just nice to meet
Another human

28:46.171 --> 28:48.664
Who shares my affinity for?
elf culture.

28:48.699 --> 28:51.158
I'm just trying to get
through the holidays.

28:51.193 --> 28:51.590
Get through?

28:51.625 --> 28:55.162
Christmas is the greatest
Day in the whole wide world!

28:55.197 --> 28:56.681
Please stop talking to me.

28:56.716 --> 28:58.130
Uh-oh. Sounds like someone

28:58.165 --> 29:00.334
Needs to sing a Christmas
Carol.

29:00.369 --> 29:00.866
Go away.

29:00.901 --> 29:02.668
The best way to
Spread Christmas cheer

29:02.703 --> 29:04.337
Is singing loud for all to hear.

29:04.372 --> 29:05.436
Thanks, but I don't sing.

29:05.471 --> 29:07.940
Oh, it's easy, it's just like
Talking...

29:07.975 --> 29:08.873
Except louder and longer

29:08.908 --> 29:10.107
And you move your voice up
And down.

29:10.142 --> 29:12.878
I can sing, but I just choose not
to sing.

29:12.913 --> 29:15.064
Especially in front of other
people.

29:15.099 --> 29:17.181
Well, if you sing alone,
You can sing

29:17.216 --> 29:18.851
In front of other people. There's
no difference.

29:18.886 --> 29:21.420
Actually, there's a big difference.

29:21.455 --> 29:23.356
No, there... no, there isn't.

29:23.391 --> 29:24.846
Wait.

29:25.825 --> 29:26.623
I'm singing

29:26.658 --> 29:30.011
I'm in a store, and I'm singing

29:30.046 --> 29:33.330
I'm in a store, and I'm singing

29:33.365 --> 29:36.801
Hey! There's no singing in the
North Pole.

29:36.836 --> 29:38.136
Yes, there is.

29:38.171 --> 29:39.402
No, there's not.

29:39.437 --> 29:41.840
We sing all the time.
No, there's not.

29:41.875 --> 29:44.476
Especially when we make toys.

29:44.511 --> 29:45.175
See?

29:45.210 --> 29:47.512
Attention,
all gimbel's shoppers,

29:47.547 --> 29:49.998
Please make your final purchases.

29:50.033 --> 29:52.859
We'll be closing in ten minutes.

29:52.894 --> 29:55.651
Well, it's time for me to go home.

29:55.686 --> 29:59.356
But... but Santa's coming,
There's so much to do.

29:59.391 --> 30:02.658
Yeah, um... laughs

30:02.693 --> 30:05.229
I'll see you tomorrow...

30:05.264 --> 30:08.432
Buddy. Jovie.

30:08.467 --> 30:10.525
Hi. Hi.

30:13.203 --> 30:14.471
Jovie.

31:09.090 --> 31:11.759
Hey, uh... I'm gonna eat in the
bedroom, okay?

31:11.794 --> 31:12.858
I, uh, I got

31:12.893 --> 31:14.560
A bunch of stuff to go over.

31:14.595 --> 31:16.931
Are you sure? I'm... I'm just way
Behind

31:16.966 --> 31:18.766
On a bunch of stuff.

31:18.801 --> 31:20.097
Okay.

31:23.604 --> 31:25.272
Can I eat in my room?

31:25.307 --> 31:26.772
No. Why not?

31:26.807 --> 31:27.839
Dad's eating in his room.

31:27.874 --> 31:30.243
I got a bunch
Of homework to go over,

31:30.278 --> 31:32.612
And I'm way behind on a bunch
of stuff.

31:32.647 --> 31:35.103
You're eating here.

32:08.614 --> 32:11.850
I really can't stay

32:11.885 --> 32:15.454
I've got to go 'way

32:15.489 --> 32:19.023
This evening has been

32:19.058 --> 32:22.492
So very nice

32:22.527 --> 32:26.529
My mother will start to worry

32:26.564 --> 32:31.135
And father will be pacing'
The floor

32:31.170 --> 32:35.404
So, really, I'd better scurry

32:35.439 --> 32:40.308
Well, may be just a half a drink
More

32:40.343 --> 32:44.881
The neighbors might think
Baby, it's bad out there

32:44.916 --> 32:47.401
Say, what's in this drink?

32:47.436 --> 32:49.851
No cabs to be had out there

32:49.886 --> 32:55.123
I wish I knew how to break the
Spell

32:55.158 --> 32:59.362
I'll take your hat, your hair
Looks swell

32:59.397 --> 33:01.865
I ought to say no, no, no, sir

33:01.900 --> 33:03.865
Mind if I move in closer?

33:03.900 --> 33:06.285
At least I'm gonna say that
I tried

33:06.320 --> 33:08.671
What's the sense of hurting?
my pride?

33:08.706 --> 33:11.505
I really can't stay

33:11.540 --> 33:18.914
Ah, but it's cold outside baby,
it's cold outside!

33:24.887 --> 33:27.423
Get out! Don't look at me!

33:27.458 --> 33:28.889
Get out!

33:41.436 --> 33:44.439
Just hear those sleigh bells
Jingling

33:44.474 --> 33:47.907
Ring-ting-tingling, too

33:47.942 --> 33:50.210
Come on, it's lovely weather

33:50.245 --> 33:54.248
For a sleigh ride together
With you

33:54.283 --> 33:56.617
Outside the snow is falling

33:56.652 --> 33:58.952
And friends are calling yoo-hoo

33:58.987 --> 33:59.851
Dad?

33:59.886 --> 34:02.054
Come on, its lovely weather dad.

34:02.089 --> 34:05.492
Dad, hi! It's me! For a sleigh
Ride together with you

34:05.527 --> 34:07.326
Buddy. Dad! Dad! Dad!

34:07.361 --> 34:10.847
Giddy-yap, giddy-yap, giddy-yap

34:10.882 --> 34:14.299
Let's go, let's look at the show

34:14.333 --> 34:19.272
We're riding in a wonderland
Of snow

34:19.306 --> 34:20.271
Hey! It's okay,

34:20.306 --> 34:21.940
I just have a gift for my dad.

34:21.976 --> 34:22.806
Okay, I'll take this.

34:22.842 --> 34:24.443
Okay. Well, just make sure he knows

34:24.478 --> 34:25.879
It's from me buddy, his son, okay?

34:25.914 --> 34:27.245
Okay. And that I love him so much,

34:27.280 --> 34:29.815
And that I think he's the greatest
dad in the world.

34:29.850 --> 34:31.081
You guys are so strong.

34:31.117 --> 34:33.551
Wow! My cheeks are nice
And rosy

34:33.585 --> 34:36.889
This is neat. And comfy
Cozy are we

34:36.924 --> 34:40.056
We're snuggled up together

34:40.092 --> 34:44.062
Like two birds of a feather
Would be

34:44.097 --> 34:46.965
Let's take that road before us

34:47.000 --> 34:49.818
And sing a chorus or two

34:49.853 --> 34:52.601
Come on, it's lovely weather

34:52.637 --> 34:57.574
For a sleigh ride together
With you

35:05.350 --> 35:07.049
Hey, you. Me?

35:07.084 --> 35:10.918
Come here. I wanna talk to you.

35:12.323 --> 35:14.124
What do you wanna talk to?
Me about?

35:14.159 --> 35:14.790
How come you were

35:14.825 --> 35:17.394
In the women's locker room these
morning?

35:17.429 --> 35:18.093
I heard you singing.

35:18.128 --> 35:20.531
You sure it had nothing to
Do with the fact

35:20.566 --> 35:22.200
That I was naked in the shower?

35:22.235 --> 35:24.419
I didn't know you were naked.

35:24.454 --> 35:26.046
Why were you here so early?

35:26.081 --> 35:27.603
They shut my water off.

35:27.638 --> 35:30.506
What were you doing here so
early?

35:30.541 --> 35:32.838
Building this.

35:34.077 --> 35:36.110
You built this? Mm-hmm.

35:36.145 --> 35:38.848
They're kind a pissed about
this.

35:38.883 --> 35:40.145
Really?

35:40.883 --> 35:42.350
Hey, guys.

35:42.385 --> 35:43.384
Have you seen the place?
Mm-hmm.

35:43.419 --> 35:45.521
It's pretty good. It's a
little too good.

35:45.556 --> 35:47.588
Corporate must have sent in a
professional.

35:47.623 --> 35:50.493
I don't know why some body's
Gunning' for my job,

35:50.528 --> 35:54.130
But, look... let's
Remain team, okay?

35:54.165 --> 35:56.115
'Cause if I go, we all go.

35:56.150 --> 35:58.031
If you get wind of anything,

35:58.066 --> 36:00.634
Call me on my radio,
Channel three.

36:00.669 --> 36:03.705
Code word is "Santa's got
A brand new bag,"

36:03.740 --> 36:05.036
Okay?

36:05.540 --> 36:08.560
Six-inch ribbon curis, honey.

36:08.595 --> 36:11.580
That's impossible. Six... inches.

36:15.150 --> 36:16.918
By the way... I think you have

36:16.953 --> 36:18.687
The most beautiful singing voice

36:18.722 --> 36:20.677
In the whole wide world.

36:28.229 --> 36:29.895
Santa...

36:29.930 --> 36:32.433
Hey, hey! Ho ho ho!

36:33.701 --> 36:35.034
Yeah!

36:35.069 --> 36:37.937
Santa, it's me buddy!

36:37.972 --> 36:40.975
It's me! Hey, buddy,
How you doing?

36:41.010 --> 36:41.941
It's me!

36:41.976 --> 36:43.610
Are you ready to see Santa?

36:43.645 --> 36:45.009
Who the heck are you?

36:45.044 --> 36:47.580
What are you talking about?
I'm Santa Claus.

36:47.615 --> 36:48.413
No, you're not.

36:48.448 --> 36:51.618
Uh, WH-why, of course I am!

36:51.653 --> 36:52.584
Ho ho ho ho ho!

36:52.619 --> 36:54.452
Well, if you're Santa...

36:54.487 --> 36:57.657
What song did I sing for you on?
Your birthday this year?

36:57.692 --> 37:01.261
Uh, happy birthday of course!

37:01.296 --> 37:02.394
Ho ho ho ho ho!

37:02.429 --> 37:05.465
Uh, so, how old are you, son?

37:05.500 --> 37:05.997
Four.

37:06.032 --> 37:07.399
You're a big boy, what's
your name?

37:07.434 --> 37:10.002
Paul. And, uh, what can I
get you for Christmas?

37:10.037 --> 37:11.236
Paul... don't tell him what
You want.

37:11.271 --> 37:13.637
He's a liar. Let the kid talk.

37:13.672 --> 37:16.942
You disgust me. How can you live?
With yourself?

37:16.977 --> 37:19.111
Just cool it, zippy. Woman:
Smile.

37:19.146 --> 37:20.911
You sit on a throne of lies.

37:20.946 --> 37:23.115
Look, I'm not kidding'.
You're a fake.

37:23.150 --> 37:24.081
I'm a fake? Yes.

37:24.116 --> 37:26.452
How'd you like to be dead, huh?

37:26.487 --> 37:29.455
Fake. No, he's kidding.

37:29.490 --> 37:29.953
You stink.

37:29.988 --> 37:32.323
I think you're gonna have a good
Christmas, all right?

37:32.358 --> 37:34.042
You smell like beef and cheese.

37:34.077 --> 37:35.726
You don't smell like Santa.

37:35.761 --> 37:36.994
Okay.

37:38.596 --> 37:41.531
He's an imposter! He's not
Santa!

37:42.266 --> 37:46.504
He's a fake! He's a fake!
Come here. Come here!

37:46.539 --> 37:47.971
I saw!

37:49.807 --> 37:51.536
He's a fake!

37:57.147 --> 38:00.583
Ha ha! Where you going now?
Where you going...?

38:02.686 --> 38:05.814
Ohh! Ohh!

38:08.825 --> 38:10.656
No!

38:13.663 --> 38:17.033
He's not Santa Claus!

38:17.068 --> 38:18.830
He's not Santa!

38:21.036 --> 38:22.799
"To someone special."

38:49.564 --> 38:51.733
What's that? Intercom.

38:51.768 --> 38:53.835
All right.

38:56.538 --> 39:00.542
Yeah? Mr. Hobbs, the police are
On line one.

39:00.577 --> 39:03.344
Police. Hello?

39:21.828 --> 39:22.528
Dad!

39:22.563 --> 39:24.798
I knew that you'd come,
I love you for coming.

39:24.833 --> 39:26.367
Officer tom, this is my dad.

39:26.402 --> 39:27.901
This is Walter... he came.

39:27.936 --> 39:28.700
He bailed me out.

39:28.735 --> 39:29.936
They gave me one phone call.

39:29.971 --> 39:31.103
They gave me one phone call,

39:31.138 --> 39:33.606
And I said," I know who
I'm gonna call...

39:33.641 --> 39:34.272
Walter Hobbs."

39:34.307 --> 39:35.273
And sure enough, you showed up.

39:35.308 --> 39:37.326
You did, they said you weren't
goanna show up.

39:37.361 --> 39:39.988
They told me so many times...
shh shh shh shh shh.

39:40.023 --> 39:42.615
Just who the heck are you,
And what is your problem?

39:42.650 --> 39:44.750
I- I'm buddy, I'm your son.

39:44.785 --> 39:45.850
Wait, um...

39:45.885 --> 39:47.737
Tell me, tell me, tell me, uh...

39:47.772 --> 39:49.589
Where'd you get this picture?

39:49.624 --> 39:52.183
Papa elf gave it to me.

39:53.092 --> 39:55.094
Listen... is this some kind a
game?

39:55.129 --> 39:56.646
What do you want, some money?

39:56.681 --> 39:58.128
No! I just wanted to meet you,

39:58.163 --> 40:01.394
And I thought you might Anna
Meet me.

40:06.404 --> 40:08.634
Who wouldn't Anna meet you?

40:08.740 --> 40:11.209
I thought maybe we could make
Gingerbread houses,

40:11.244 --> 40:13.678
And eat cookie dough, and go
Ice skating, and...

40:13.713 --> 40:15.914
And maybe even hold hands.

40:15.949 --> 40:17.647
Uh-huh.

40:17.682 --> 40:19.775
Come with me. Okay.

40:26.190 --> 40:30.650
Okay. What have we got here?

40:39.236 --> 40:41.466
Buddy, don't eat those.

40:46.876 --> 40:47.909
Ohh!

40:47.944 --> 40:49.277
We got to really hurry up, Walter,

40:49.312 --> 40:51.948
'cause I'm double booked the
rest of the afternoon.

40:51.983 --> 40:52.447
Am I sick?

40:52.482 --> 40:53.750
Yeah, but that's not why we're
Here.

40:53.785 --> 40:54.716
We're hereto do a test, come on.

40:54.751 --> 40:55.783
What kind test? Just a test to
Find out

40:55.818 --> 40:57.954
If you're my son or not. Why am
I sitting on paper?

40:57.989 --> 40:59.973
Because it's sanitary for the
other patients.

41:00.008 --> 41:01.958
Now, sit still so I can do
the finger prick.

41:01.993 --> 41:03.577
Finger prick!

41:03.612 --> 41:05.126
Ohh! It's cold.

41:05.161 --> 41:06.212
Yeah, just pleases it still,
Please?

41:06.247 --> 41:07.228
Okay, can I listen to your
necklace?

41:07.263 --> 41:08.831
No, you can't. Will you
Just sit still...

41:08.866 --> 41:09.831
Why is there a skeleton?
over there?

41:09.866 --> 41:11.049
I don't know, Walter,
Could you please...?

41:11.084 --> 41:12.192
If I squint it looks like a
pirate flag.

41:12.227 --> 41:13.266
Could you please have him?
Sit still?

41:13.301 --> 41:14.736
Does he have a name? No,
He hasn't got a name.

41:14.771 --> 41:15.702
I'm sorry, Ben, I am sorry.

41:15.737 --> 41:16.771
I have a lot of patients
waiting.

41:16.806 --> 41:18.373
Would you please it still?
Please.

41:18.408 --> 41:19.906
He got mad at me. Yes, he did.
He did.

41:19.941 --> 41:22.210
The sooner you sit still,
The sooner we can

41:22.245 --> 41:22.943
Get this mess over with.

41:22.978 --> 41:24.429
Okay. Then can we eat sugar
plums?

41:24.464 --> 41:25.846
You betch a... we'll eat sugar
Plums,

41:25.881 --> 41:28.817
Have gingerbread houses,
And we'll even paint eggs.

41:28.852 --> 41:31.217
Well, paint eggs, that's Easter.

41:31.920 --> 41:35.254
Ow! Ohh...

41:35.289 --> 41:37.356
My finger has a heartbeat.

41:37.391 --> 41:40.194
It won't hurt so much after
a little.

41:40.229 --> 41:41.996
What's your name?

41:42.031 --> 41:43.663
Buddy.

41:43.698 --> 41:45.266
I'm Carolyn.

41:45.301 --> 41:46.733
Hi.

41:47.201 --> 41:48.903
What do you want for Christmas?

41:48.938 --> 41:49.969
A Suzy-talks-a-lot.

41:50.004 --> 41:52.740
I'll put in a good word with
the big man.

41:52.775 --> 41:54.674
Thanks. Your costume is pretty.

41:54.709 --> 41:58.012
Oh, it's not a costume.
I'm an elf.

41:58.047 --> 41:59.913
Well, technically, I'm a human,

41:59.948 --> 42:01.379
But I was raised by elves.

42:01.414 --> 42:04.784
Oh, I'm a human raised by humans.

42:04.819 --> 42:07.446
Hmm. Cool.

42:12.258 --> 42:14.783
So?

42:16.362 --> 42:19.566
It's a boy... buddy's your son.

42:19.601 --> 42:21.199
That's very impossible.

42:21.234 --> 42:22.835
You... you saw that guy out there.

42:22.870 --> 42:24.336
He's... he's certifiably insane.

42:24.371 --> 42:25.769
He's probably just reverting

42:25.804 --> 42:28.407
To a state of childlike
dependency.

42:28.442 --> 42:29.373
An elf?

42:29.408 --> 42:31.443
What he needs is to be nurtured.

42:31.478 --> 42:33.462
Oh, I see.

42:33.497 --> 42:35.412
So, um, uh...

42:35.447 --> 42:37.132
You'd like me to breastfeed him?

42:37.167 --> 42:38.782
Walter, just bring him home.

42:38.817 --> 42:39.983
Introduce him to Emily and
Michael,

42:40.018 --> 42:42.219
And once... once he comes to
Terms with reality,

42:42.254 --> 42:45.390
He should drop the whole elf
Thing and move on with his life.

42:45.425 --> 42:47.892
I mean, that's what I would do if
I was you.

42:47.927 --> 42:51.462
Oh, my god! Walter, this is...

42:51.497 --> 42:52.762
This is wonderful,

42:52.797 --> 42:54.649
You... you have another son.

42:54.684 --> 42:56.466
Wonderful. Oh, gosh, I...

42:56.501 --> 42:59.303
I guess I never really thought
of it that way.

42:59.338 --> 43:00.737
This is incredible, I...

43:00.772 --> 43:03.024
You know, it's a little
complicated,

43:03.059 --> 43:05.276
But it's nothing that we can't
handle.

43:05.311 --> 43:07.744
Honey? What?

43:07.779 --> 43:10.782
He thinks he's an elf.

43:10.817 --> 43:11.880
I'm sorry, what?

43:11.915 --> 43:14.584
He think she's a Christmas elf.

43:14.619 --> 43:15.283
Oh, come on, Walter,

43:15.318 --> 43:19.516
I'm sure he doesn't actually
think he's an elf.

43:19.623 --> 43:22.926
And then, I traveled through
the seven levels

43:22.961 --> 43:24.426
Of the candy cane forest,

43:24.461 --> 43:28.597
Past the sea of swirly-twirly
gumdrops,

43:28.632 --> 43:34.298
And then, I walked through the
Lincoln tunnel.

43:51.821 --> 43:53.516
Ahh.

43:54.957 --> 43:58.661
So, where were you for the
last 30 years?

43:58.696 --> 43:59.560
The north pole.

43:59.595 --> 44:02.280
Can you pass the maple syrup?
Please?

44:02.315 --> 44:06.159
I... I didn't put... it's
spaghetti.

44:06.194 --> 44:10.004
Oh, you know what? I think
I have some.

44:10.039 --> 44:11.437
Yes.

44:12.340 --> 44:14.125
You like sugar, huh?

44:14.160 --> 44:15.910
Is there sugar in syrup?

44:15.945 --> 44:17.076
Yes.

44:17.111 --> 44:18.344
Then yes.

44:18.379 --> 44:20.882
We elves try to stick to the
four main food groups

44:20.917 --> 44:26.987
Candy, candy canes, candy corns,
and syrup.

44:27.022 --> 44:30.657
So, will you be staying with us?
Then?

44:30.692 --> 44:31.824
You mean I can stay?

44:31.859 --> 44:33.358
Of course you can. Emily.

44:33.393 --> 44:35.896
How... how long do you think
you'll be with us?

44:35.931 --> 44:38.399
I... I hadn't really planned
it out,

44:38.434 --> 44:40.833
But I was thinking, like...
forever.

44:40.868 --> 44:43.604
Emily? Can I just speak to you
for a minute

44:43.639 --> 44:46.402
in the, uh, kitchen, please?

44:49.041 --> 44:51.210
Are you crazy? He cannot
stay here.

44:51.245 --> 44:53.344
Clearly he has some serious issues.

44:53.379 --> 44:55.615
We can't just throw him out in
the snow.

44:55.650 --> 44:57.483
Why not? He loves the snow.

44:57.518 --> 44:59.531
He's told me 15 times.

44:59.566 --> 45:01.545
Walter, he's your son.

45:15.433 --> 45:17.094
Did you hear that?

45:18.436 --> 45:21.132
You are so weird.

45:23.041 --> 45:24.474
Dad?

45:27.445 --> 45:29.208
Dad?

45:30.081 --> 45:32.481
Dad!

45:33.151 --> 45:34.286
What?

45:38.255 --> 45:39.523
What?

45:43.761 --> 45:45.661
I am not gonna tuck you in.

45:45.696 --> 45:49.097
I... I promise I'll go right
to sleep.

45:51.268 --> 45:52.735
Fine.

46:00.210 --> 46:02.361
Tickle fight, tickle fight!
buddy, stop.

46:02.396 --> 46:04.514
Tickle fight. Tickle... stop
stop, stop.

46:04.549 --> 46:06.106
Sorry.

46:06.950 --> 46:08.151
It's all right.

46:08.186 --> 46:09.085
Hey, uh...

46:09.719 --> 46:12.155
You just lay there and go to
sleep.

46:12.190 --> 46:13.468
Okay.

46:13.503 --> 46:14.746
Okay.

46:15.625 --> 46:18.556
Dad? Hmm?

46:18.591 --> 46:21.487
I love you.

46:24.000 --> 46:27.560
Okay. Go to sleep now.

46:32.007 --> 46:33.273
Well, this is really something.

46:33.308 --> 46:37.642
I'm usually the one making
breakfast.

46:38.647 --> 46:41.673
That's good, that's good.

46:43.018 --> 46:44.645
Okay.

46:51.792 --> 46:53.494
Oh, that's good.

46:53.529 --> 46:55.229
Good? Good.

46:55.264 --> 46:56.529
Good.

46:56.564 --> 46:59.498
So, did you, um...

46:59.533 --> 47:01.135
Did you sleep okay last night?

47:01.170 --> 47:02.702
Great. I got a full 40 minutes.

47:02.737 --> 47:06.036
And I had time to build that
rocking horse.

47:06.173 --> 47:10.244
Uh, oh, my gosh. You actually
made that?

47:10.279 --> 47:13.042
Where did you get all the wood?

47:22.789 --> 47:25.675
Good morning, honey. Good
morning, dad.

47:25.710 --> 47:28.561
Walter, buddy has made us
breakfast.

47:28.596 --> 47:30.530
Isn't that nice?

47:30.565 --> 47:32.349
And lunch.

47:32.384 --> 47:33.776
And lunch.

47:33.811 --> 47:35.133
Bye.

47:35.168 --> 47:36.101
So, dad, how many scoops?

47:36.136 --> 47:39.071
I'll stick with the coffee now,
thanks.

47:41.306 --> 47:42.139
So, dad...

47:42.174 --> 47:43.841
I planned out our whole day.

47:43.876 --> 47:45.042
First, we'll make snow angels
for two hours,

47:45.077 --> 47:47.713
And then we'll go ice skating
and then we'll eat a
whole roll

47:47.748 --> 47:49.782
Of tollhouse cookie dough as fast
as we can,

47:49.817 --> 47:52.117
And then, to finish, we'll snuggle.

47:52.152 --> 47:54.820
I've got to go to work, buddy.

47:54.855 --> 47:56.020
Oh, and another thing...

47:56.055 --> 47:57.856
If you're going to be staying
here,

47:57.891 --> 47:59.658
You should think about, you know,

47:59.693 --> 48:01.325
Getting rid of the costume.

48:01.360 --> 48:02.693
But I've worn this my whole life.

48:02.728 --> 48:05.863
You're not in the North Pole any
longer.

48:05.898 --> 48:08.166
You wanna make me happy, don't you?

48:08.201 --> 48:08.765
More than anything.

48:08.800 --> 48:13.638
Then, lose the tights. I mean,
as soon as possible.

48:13.673 --> 48:15.273
As soon as possible?

48:15.308 --> 48:16.874
As soon as possible.

48:16.909 --> 48:18.273
Okay.

48:20.078 --> 48:21.279
I almost forgot...

48:21.314 --> 48:23.179
Aah! Aah!

48:26.117 --> 48:27.811
Good morning.

48:32.289 --> 48:32.854
Walter here.

48:32.889 --> 48:35.157
It worked, it's you.

48:35.192 --> 48:37.177
How'd you get this number?

48:37.212 --> 48:39.162
Emily left an emergency list.

48:39.197 --> 48:39.761
I see.

48:39.796 --> 48:41.431
And, uh, is this an emergency?

48:41.466 --> 48:42.597
There's a horrible noise

48:42.632 --> 48:45.635
Coming from the evil
box underneath the window.

48:45.670 --> 48:46.937
It sounds like this...

48:50.607 --> 48:53.442
It's, uh, it's... it's not evil,
buddy,

48:53.477 --> 48:54.575
It's, uh, it's a radiator,

48:54.610 --> 48:56.445
And the heat makes noise when
it comes on.

48:56.480 --> 48:59.649
No, it doesn't. It... It's very
evil.

48:59.684 --> 49:03.303
It's scary to look at. It's...
okay...

49:03.338 --> 49:06.922
I'm going toward... oh, wait.
Yes, it is.

49:06.957 --> 49:08.624
Okay, it's okay. It's okay.

49:08.659 --> 49:09.542
Everything's fine.

49:09.577 --> 49:10.391
You were right.

49:10.426 --> 49:12.928
Okay, good, uh, I'm gonna hang
up now.

49:12.963 --> 49:13.761
I love you.

49:13.796 --> 49:15.481
I'll call you in five minutes.

49:15.516 --> 49:17.130
No, no, buddy, don't, uh...

49:17.165 --> 49:19.701
You... you don't have to call me,
okay?

49:19.736 --> 49:21.267
Good idea, you call me.

49:21.302 --> 49:23.103
Okay. I'm gonna hang up now.

49:23.138 --> 49:24.973
I painted a picture of a
butterfly.

49:25.008 --> 49:27.275
Good. I'm gonna hang up now.

49:27.310 --> 49:29.528
I tuned the piano.

49:29.563 --> 49:31.746
Okay, I love you. Bye.

49:31.781 --> 49:33.713
Mmm...

49:33.748 --> 49:35.340
Mmm... Mmm.

49:49.830 --> 49:51.865
Mmm.

49:52.833 --> 49:55.666
Hobbs. Hey!

49:55.936 --> 49:57.369
How you doing? Please, sit
down.

49:57.404 --> 49:59.706
I haven't seen you since
the retreat.

49:59.741 --> 50:00.639
You're looking good.

50:00.674 --> 50:02.092
Oh, thank you very much.
You as well.

50:02.127 --> 50:03.475
To what do I owe the, uh,
pleasure?

50:03.510 --> 50:06.910
Well, to be honest, I got a call
from my niece.

50:07.914 --> 50:08.713
She wants to know

50:08.748 --> 50:12.499
How a certain puppy and a
certain pigeon

50:12.534 --> 50:16.250
Escape the clutches of a
certain evil witch.

50:17.723 --> 50:18.322
Believe me, uh,

50:18.357 --> 50:19.857
We're already looking for new
printers.

50:19.892 --> 50:22.444
This one has obviously gotten a
little sloppy.

50:22.479 --> 50:24.997
Maybe it isn't the printer who's
gotten sloppy.

50:25.032 --> 50:27.198
That's your signature, right?

50:27.233 --> 50:30.235
You know, we could sit here and
point fingers all day.

50:30.270 --> 50:31.735
I've got news for you...

50:31.770 --> 50:34.306
Even if those two pages were
in there,

50:34.341 --> 50:35.739
The book still would have sucked.

50:35.774 --> 50:38.059
Have you seen the numbers for
this quarter?

50:38.094 --> 50:40.345
Uh, they'll be here today. Oh,
they're in.

50:40.380 --> 50:42.247
That frigging puppy and pigeon

50:42.282 --> 50:43.480
Are tanking hard, Hobbs.

50:43.515 --> 50:45.483
My people estimate we're
gonna post

50:45.518 --> 50:47.250
A minus eight for this quarter.

50:47.285 --> 50:50.487
A minus eight! That does not
happen!

50:50.522 --> 50:52.991
You know, we'll... we'll bounce
back, we...

50:53.026 --> 50:54.776
No, no, no. No? Well...

50:54.811 --> 50:56.527
We're gonna ship a new book

50:56.562 --> 50:57.929
The first quarter.

50:57.964 --> 50:59.261
First quarter?

50:59.296 --> 51:01.915
I'm gonna be back in town on
the 24th.

51:01.950 --> 51:04.535
At that time, I would love
to hear

51:04.570 --> 51:06.302
In exact detail

51:06.337 --> 51:09.534
What your plans are for this
new book.

51:09.740 --> 51:13.437
Uh, wait a minute, the, uh
the 24th, that's Christmas
eve.

51:15.279 --> 51:16.245
And?

51:16.280 --> 51:18.213
And, uh...

51:18.248 --> 51:21.284
No problem. Be great to have
you in the loop.

51:24.387 --> 51:27.423
All right, I got every
weapon in the game.

51:27.458 --> 51:29.926
I got full health, I got full
armor.

51:29.961 --> 51:30.758
Michael!

51:30.793 --> 51:31.928
I got full...

51:31.963 --> 51:33.061
Michael!

51:33.096 --> 51:35.064
It's me buddy!

51:35.832 --> 51:36.531
You know that guy?

51:36.566 --> 51:39.535
No, I've never seen him before.

51:39.570 --> 51:42.504
It's me buddy! Your brother!

51:42.539 --> 51:43.870
Oh, man.

51:43.905 --> 51:48.510
No, Michael! Wait! It's your
brother bud...

51:49.444 --> 51:52.072
Sorry. Sorry! Horn honks

51:52.781 --> 51:55.450
Michael! Michael!

51:55.485 --> 51:57.251
Michael!

51:57.286 --> 51:59.621
Michael, wait up!

51:59.656 --> 52:01.223
Michael! Michael!

52:01.258 --> 52:02.756
Wow, you're fast.

52:02.791 --> 52:04.643
I'm gladi caught up with you.

52:04.678 --> 52:06.253
I waited five hours for you.

52:06.288 --> 52:07.793
Why is your coat so big?

52:07.828 --> 52:10.314
So, good news... I saw a dog
today.

52:10.349 --> 52:12.800
Have you seen a dog?
You probably have.

52:12.835 --> 52:14.500
How was school? Was it fun?

52:14.535 --> 52:16.437
Did you get a lot of
homework, huh?

52:16.472 --> 52:17.705
Do you have any friends?

52:17.740 --> 52:19.190
Do you have a best friend?

52:19.225 --> 52:20.641
Does he have a big coat, too?

52:20.676 --> 52:22.108
Go away!

52:23.477 --> 52:27.607
Ow! Son of a nutcracker!

52:30.451 --> 52:31.883
Run!

52:32.352 --> 52:35.822
Get him! Get the
green guy!

52:42.829 --> 52:45.565
Oh, no. These guys are bad news.

52:45.600 --> 52:48.159
We better get outta here.

52:49.469 --> 52:51.970
You know what? We can take 'em.

52:52.005 --> 52:55.997
Okay, just start making as
many snowballs as you can.

53:03.115 --> 53:05.515
You ready?

53:06.452 --> 53:09.250
Let's go. Aah! Ow.

53:10.456 --> 53:11.855
Ow!

53:16.695 --> 53:18.560
Run!

53:26.571 --> 53:29.374
Oh, man. One got away.

53:29.409 --> 53:30.671
Snowball.

53:39.050 --> 53:40.677
Unh!

53:41.452 --> 53:42.919
Wow.

53:43.553 --> 53:46.386
Where did you say you were from?

53:47.391 --> 53:48.623
Oh, yeah

53:48.658 --> 53:51.361
Candles burning low

53:51.396 --> 53:54.029
Lots of mistletoe

53:54.064 --> 53:59.868
Lots of snow and ice everywhere
we go

53:59.903 --> 54:05.442
Choirs singing carols right
outside my door

54:05.477 --> 54:07.445
All these things and more

54:07.480 --> 54:09.412
I wish dad were here.

54:09.447 --> 54:09.677
Why?

54:09.712 --> 54:13.649
'Cause he's the greatest dad in
the whole wide world.

54:13.684 --> 54:14.482
Are you kidding?

54:14.517 --> 54:17.086
He's the worst dad in the world.

54:17.121 --> 54:18.888
What do you mean?

54:18.923 --> 54:20.656
All he does is work.

54:20.691 --> 54:22.056
Working's fun.

54:22.091 --> 54:24.091
Not the way he does it.

54:24.126 --> 54:25.126
All he cares about is money.

54:25.161 --> 54:29.265
He doesn't care about you,
or me, or anybody.

54:29.300 --> 54:32.097
Well, he is on the naughty list.

54:36.738 --> 54:38.601
You like her?

54:38.636 --> 54:40.464
Like who?

54:40.608 --> 54:42.477
The girl you're staring at.

54:42.512 --> 54:44.261
Oh, uh...

54:44.296 --> 54:46.010
Yeah.

54:47.282 --> 54:49.451
Why don't you ask her out?

54:49.486 --> 54:50.417
Out?

54:50.452 --> 54:53.555
You know, on a date...
to eat food.

54:53.590 --> 54:54.421
Food?

54:54.456 --> 54:57.189
Yes, real food, not candy.

54:57.224 --> 54:59.874
And if she says yes,
you're in.

54:59.909 --> 55:02.524
It's like a secret code
girls have.

55:04.131 --> 55:06.133
Well, look who it is.

55:06.168 --> 55:09.261
Hi, Jovie. Hi.

55:11.238 --> 55:13.006
Oh, uh, this is Michael.

55:13.041 --> 55:14.633
I'm his brother.

55:15.609 --> 55:16.608
Hi.

55:16.643 --> 55:18.444
So, what are you doing here?

55:18.479 --> 55:21.063
Did gimbel's give you your
job back?

55:21.098 --> 55:23.649
No. But things worked out
pretty good.

55:23.684 --> 55:25.708
They gave mea restraining
order.

55:25.818 --> 55:29.789
Well, um, you should probably
get outta here.

55:29.824 --> 55:32.690
Ho ho ho!

55:32.725 --> 55:34.959
But... I really wanted to
see you,

55:34.994 --> 55:39.065
And... and I think you're
beautiful, and I, um...

55:39.100 --> 55:42.535
I feel really warm when I
am around you,

55:42.570 --> 55:46.834
And, um, my tongue swells up.

55:50.809 --> 55:53.039
So...

55:53.345 --> 55:55.540
Do you wanna go eat food?

55:56.214 --> 55:58.517
Do I... do I wanna eat food?

55:58.552 --> 55:59.483
Mm-hmm.

55:59.518 --> 56:04.820
You know, uh, the code... food.

56:06.558 --> 56:09.685
Well, I just had my lunch
break.

56:10.060 --> 56:12.879
Oh, okay. I understand.

56:12.914 --> 56:15.699
But I'm free on Thursday.

56:16.700 --> 56:18.133
Thursday! Thursday!

56:18.168 --> 56:20.337
Come on. That'd be great.

56:20.372 --> 56:21.303
All right.

56:21.338 --> 56:23.072
Was that okay?

56:23.107 --> 56:25.735
You did great, man.

56:26.243 --> 56:27.611
What should we put on it
first?

56:27.646 --> 56:28.996
Lights! Oh, good.

56:29.031 --> 56:30.312
And then, after that?

56:30.347 --> 56:33.214
Ornaments! Ornaments, okay.

56:34.150 --> 56:35.683
What the hell's that?

56:35.718 --> 56:36.986
A Christmas tree.

56:37.021 --> 56:38.219
A Christmas tree?

56:38.254 --> 56:41.382
Buddy chopped it down in
the park.

56:42.158 --> 56:43.591
Emily.

56:43.626 --> 56:46.229
I don't know what you're making
such a big deal about.

56:46.264 --> 56:48.265
They were just having a
little fun.

56:48.300 --> 56:50.231
Oh, fun? So felonies are
fun now?

56:50.266 --> 56:53.069
I thought, see, felonies
were felonies.

56:53.104 --> 56:54.035
Okay, the tree thing was bad.

56:54.070 --> 56:55.336
I'll get him to plant
another one.

56:55.371 --> 56:57.973
But at least Michael is
happy for once.

56:58.008 --> 57:00.541
What, uh, what's that supposed
to mean?

57:00.576 --> 57:02.878
Well, I don't think it's any
secret, Walter,

57:02.913 --> 57:05.180
That you haven't exactly been
there for him.

57:05.215 --> 57:07.149
I'll tell you what, why don't
we just

57:07.184 --> 57:09.084
Pull him outta school and let
the, uh,

57:09.119 --> 57:10.384
Deranged elf man raise him?

57:10.419 --> 57:13.255
Then they can have lots of
fun committing felonies.

57:13.290 --> 57:16.325
How are we gonna get the star
on top?

57:16.360 --> 57:17.883
I got it.

57:29.804 --> 57:30.903
I mean, what are we gonna do?

57:30.938 --> 57:33.107
We can't... we can't leave him
alone here.

57:33.142 --> 57:35.632
He's gonna destroy the place.

57:37.678 --> 57:38.377
Why don't you, um...

57:38.412 --> 57:39.712
Why don't you take off tomorrow?

57:39.747 --> 57:41.949
You know, and you could stay
home and watch him?

57:41.984 --> 57:44.285
Oh, no. No, I can't stay home
tomorrow,

57:44.320 --> 57:45.637
I have a budget meeting tomorrow.

57:45.672 --> 57:47.546
Well, honey, I can't take off,

57:47.581 --> 57:49.019
I'm one... one bad pitch away

57:49.054 --> 57:50.422
From getting fired... one.

57:50.457 --> 57:53.376
Well, I tell you what, I have
an idea then.

57:53.411 --> 57:56.295
Why don't you take buddy to
work with you?

58:03.637 --> 58:05.805
Hey, Walter. Morning, jack.

58:05.840 --> 58:07.466
Morning, jack.

58:08.108 --> 58:09.040
Oh, good morning, Mr. Hobbs.

58:09.075 --> 58:10.609
Good morning, Sarah. Good
morning, Sarah.

58:10.644 --> 58:13.679
That's a nice purple dress.
It's very purple-y

58:13.714 --> 58:15.145
Francisco. How's it going, Mr.
Hobbs?

58:15.180 --> 58:19.284
Francisco, that's fun to say..."
Francisco."

58:20.519 --> 58:21.719
Hi! Hi.

58:21.754 --> 58:22.653
Do you remember me?

58:22.688 --> 58:24.603
I do. I didn't recognize you.

58:24.638 --> 58:26.518
I know, I'm in work clothes.

58:30.029 --> 58:32.031
Thank you, Deborah.

58:32.066 --> 58:33.063
Thanks, deb.

58:33.098 --> 58:34.466
Deb, you have such a pretty face.

58:34.501 --> 58:35.833
You should be on a Christmas card.

58:35.868 --> 58:38.301
You just made my day.

58:46.144 --> 58:47.611
Eww.

58:50.348 --> 58:51.547
Buddy. Hmm?

58:51.582 --> 58:53.551
You don't have to drink that.

58:53.586 --> 58:55.075
Thank you.

59:05.195 --> 59:07.186
Francisco.

59:08.331 --> 59:10.856
Francisco.

59:12.169 --> 59:13.954
Francisco.

59:13.989 --> 59:15.597
Francisco.

59:15.632 --> 59:17.206
Buddy?

59:19.543 --> 59:20.877
Just... just a little.

59:28.551 --> 59:29.150
Yes, bud?

59:29.185 --> 59:31.854
Why is your name on the desk?

59:31.889 --> 59:34.021
I bought the desk.

59:34.056 --> 59:36.854
My name's there so no one
steals it.

59:38.694 --> 59:40.512
That's a joke, isn't it, dad?

59:40.547 --> 59:43.141
Yeah, buddy, that's a joke.

59:43.176 --> 59:45.735
So, what are we gonna build?

59:45.770 --> 59:47.068
No, uh, we don't do

59:47.103 --> 59:48.837
That kind of work here, pal.

59:50.071 --> 59:52.340
Buddy the elf, what's your
favorite color?

59:52.375 --> 59:53.742
Put that down. Hello?

59:53.777 --> 59:56.108
Hello? Dial tone

59:57.378 --> 59:59.881
Please, don't touch anything.

59:59.916 --> 01:00:01.348
Sorry.

01:00:04.719 --> 01:00:06.186
Hey...

01:00:07.922 --> 01:00:10.024
Bud, have you... have you...

01:00:10.059 --> 01:00:12.127
Have you ever seen a mailroom?

01:00:12.161 --> 01:00:13.360
A mailroom? No.

01:00:13.395 --> 01:00:14.560
No? No.

01:00:14.595 --> 01:00:15.394
Oh, I mean, wow.

01:00:15.429 --> 01:00:18.165
Wow... listen, it's a
place where mail

01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:19.164
From all over the world
comes,

01:00:19.199 --> 01:00:21.902
Uh-huh. And they sort it
out there, see?

01:00:21.937 --> 01:00:22.868
And you can touch it all,

01:00:22.903 --> 01:00:24.738
And they put it in these
shiny bins.

01:00:24.773 --> 01:00:26.238
Shiny bins? Right.

01:00:26.273 --> 01:00:28.776
What do ya think? It
sounds great.

01:00:28.811 --> 01:00:29.808
Good.

01:00:29.843 --> 01:00:31.345
Can we go there?

01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:32.111
Well, um...

01:00:32.146 --> 01:00:35.349
I gotta work here, maybe... maybe
you can work there.

01:00:35.384 --> 01:00:36.649
Okay, I'll work there.

01:00:39.185 --> 01:00:41.387
Oh, I don't think this is
the place

01:00:41.422 --> 01:00:42.653
My dad was talking about.

01:00:42.688 --> 01:00:44.190
Is there a different mailroom?

01:00:44.225 --> 01:00:46.425
No. This is the only one.

01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:48.655
It's not very shiny.

01:00:48.761 --> 01:00:52.764
Now... over here's the trench.

01:00:52.799 --> 01:00:54.899
All the mail comes out that
shooter.

01:00:54.934 --> 01:00:59.338
Scan and find the floor each
piece is moving to.

01:00:59.373 --> 01:01:00.304
Put it in a canister

01:01:00.339 --> 01:01:03.942
And shove it up the tube with
the same number.

01:01:03.977 --> 01:01:05.394
You got that?

01:01:05.429 --> 01:01:06.777
I think so.

01:01:06.812 --> 01:01:09.781
This place reminds me of
Santa's workshop.

01:01:09.816 --> 01:01:11.314
Except it smells like mushrooms,

01:01:11.349 --> 01:01:14.375
And everyone looks like they
wanna hurt me.

01:01:14.653 --> 01:01:16.655
Uh, greenway's coming in tomorrow,

01:01:16.690 --> 01:01:18.255
So, what... what do we got?

01:01:18.290 --> 01:01:20.325
Well, Morris and I have been
brainstorming,

01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:22.794
And we've come up with what I
think

01:01:22.829 --> 01:01:24.229
Is a pretty big idea.

01:01:24.264 --> 01:01:24.728
Great, what?

01:01:24.763 --> 01:01:27.298
You're gonna love it, it's
fantastic.

01:01:27.333 --> 01:01:28.264
What?

01:01:28.299 --> 01:01:31.601
Okay, picture this...

01:01:31.636 --> 01:01:34.903
We bring in miles finch.

01:01:35.806 --> 01:01:37.391
The miles finch?

01:01:37.426 --> 01:01:38.635
The golden ghost.

01:01:38.670 --> 01:01:39.809
We bring him in!

01:01:39.844 --> 01:01:42.713
He's written more classics than dr.
Seuss.

01:01:42.748 --> 01:01:43.712
I tain't gonna be easy,

01:01:43.747 --> 01:01:45.347
But I think it's worth a shot.

01:01:45.382 --> 01:01:50.019
My two top writers, my crack team,
my fun squad...

01:01:50.054 --> 01:01:51.686
You came in here pitching me

01:01:51.721 --> 01:01:54.257
The idea of hiring another writer?

01:01:54.292 --> 01:01:55.323
Yeah.

01:01:55.358 --> 01:01:57.519
Miles finch.

01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:02.755
I like it. Chuckles

01:02:03.933 --> 01:02:04.866
I like it.

01:02:04.901 --> 01:02:06.970
Then I traveled through the seven
levels

01:02:07.005 --> 01:02:07.936
Of the candy cane forest

01:02:07.971 --> 01:02:12.242
And past the sea of swirly-twirly
gumdrops.

01:02:12.277 --> 01:02:14.708
Ooh!

01:02:14.743 --> 01:02:17.778
Wow... it's sucky.

01:02:17.813 --> 01:02:20.265
Ohh, it's wonderful. Yes!

01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:22.718
That is marvelous how that...

01:02:22.753 --> 01:02:24.484
Oh!

01:02:24.519 --> 01:02:27.038
Oh, it's very sucky.

01:02:27.073 --> 01:02:29.558
It's very... sucky.

01:02:29.593 --> 01:02:30.858
Whoo.

01:02:30.893 --> 01:02:32.761
So, how'd you get here?

01:02:32.796 --> 01:02:34.229
Work release.

01:02:34.264 --> 01:02:35.329
Mm.

01:02:35.364 --> 01:02:37.898
Oh, syrup and coffee?

01:02:37.932 --> 01:02:41.235
Why didn't I think of that? Can I
try some?

01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:42.368
Be my guest.

01:02:42.403 --> 01:02:43.870
Very generous of you.

01:02:43.905 --> 01:02:48.308
Mmm. I love syrup.

01:02:50.311 --> 01:02:52.506
Ohh, I love it.

01:02:53.748 --> 01:02:55.715
Mmm...

01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:58.552
You know, I know I sound like a
broken record,

01:02:58.587 --> 01:02:59.518
But we are buddies.

01:02:59.553 --> 01:03:01.789
You're my best friend, that's it.

01:03:01.824 --> 01:03:02.520
You're my best friend.

01:03:02.555 --> 01:03:05.258
You know, buddy, nobody around
here listens to me.

01:03:05.293 --> 01:03:07.427
I got really good ideas. Yeah?
I believe it.

01:03:07.462 --> 01:03:09.462
I know, I'm right, I listen to you.

01:03:09.497 --> 01:03:10.395
You have great ideas.

01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:12.332
I just try to go with the flow,
you know?

01:03:12.367 --> 01:03:13.484
Good, you go with the flow.

01:03:13.519 --> 01:03:14.566
Yeah. Go with the flow.

01:03:14.601 --> 01:03:15.985
No, I gotta get out of the flow.

01:03:16.020 --> 01:03:17.335
Well, then get out of the flow.

01:03:17.370 --> 01:03:18.536
I'm in the flow, that's what got
me here.

01:03:18.571 --> 01:03:22.008
I gotta... I'm 26 years old, I got
nothing to show for it.

01:03:22.043 --> 01:03:24.010
You're young. You're so young.

01:03:24.978 --> 01:03:25.777
My papa... yeah?

01:03:25.812 --> 01:03:30.449
He didn't make master tinker till
he was 490,so...

01:03:33.319 --> 01:03:35.054
Four-hundred and ninety? Yeah.

01:03:36.555 --> 01:03:39.057
Tickle fight! Tickle fight!

01:03:39.092 --> 01:03:41.525
Tickle fight! Tickle fight!

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:45.064
My favorite book of yours has
gotta be Gus' pickles.

01:03:45.099 --> 01:03:48.284
It's existential, yet it's so
accessible.

01:03:48.319 --> 01:03:51.211
Uh, Mr. Finch, uh, Eugene Dupris
here.

01:03:51.246 --> 01:03:54.105
It's a thrill just to be talking
to you

01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:55.305
On our speakerphone.

01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:57.375
Miles, um, so, what do you think?

01:03:57.410 --> 01:03:58.308
Can you fly in tomorrow?

01:03:58.343 --> 01:04:00.611
I'll give you five hours tomorrow,

01:04:00.646 --> 01:04:01.811
Not a minute more.

01:04:01.846 --> 01:04:02.879
Oh, that's... that's great.

01:04:02.914 --> 01:04:06.551
I'd like a black s500to receive
me at the airport.

01:04:06.586 --> 01:04:08.353
I need the interior of that car

01:04:08.388 --> 01:04:10.353
To be 71 degrees exactly.

01:04:10.388 --> 01:04:12.123
We can do that.
Mr. Hobbs?

01:04:12.158 --> 01:04:13.858
There's a situation downstairs.

01:04:13.893 --> 01:04:15.058
I'm sorry, what?

01:04:15.092 --> 01:04:16.291
No, hold on, miles. Deb, hang up.

01:04:16.326 --> 01:04:18.460
I do not hold. Do not put
me on hold.

01:04:18.495 --> 01:04:21.098
We have a problem in the
mailroom.

01:04:21.133 --> 01:04:21.964
What's going on?

01:04:21.999 --> 01:04:24.000
Don't speak... Deborah, hang up!

01:04:24.035 --> 01:04:26.002
That's it, I'm gone. Miles!

01:04:28.872 --> 01:04:31.458
I'll be there tomorrow... 71
degrees.

01:04:31.493 --> 01:04:34.044
Sir, chuck in the mailroom

01:04:34.079 --> 01:04:35.546
Needs to talk to you.

01:04:35.581 --> 01:04:36.979
Chuck... what, chuck?

01:04:37.014 --> 01:04:38.513
I mean, what could be going on
down there

01:04:38.548 --> 01:04:40.583
That's so important you had to
interrupt me, what?

01:04:40.618 --> 01:04:42.519
Whoomp, there it is! A little
louder

01:04:42.554 --> 01:04:44.420
Whoomp, there it is! Come on, y'all

01:04:44.455 --> 01:04:46.320
Whoomp! There it is

01:04:46.355 --> 01:04:47.756
Upside down and inside out hey!

01:04:47.791 --> 01:04:49.158
I'm 'bout to show all you folks

01:04:49.193 --> 01:04:50.591
What it's all about hey!

01:04:50.626 --> 01:04:51.826
Time for me to get on the mike

01:04:51.861 --> 01:04:53.429
And make this mother of a party
hype

01:04:53.464 --> 01:04:55.081
I'm taking you back to the old
school

01:04:55.116 --> 01:04:56.664
'cause I'm an old fool who's so cool

01:04:56.699 --> 01:04:58.501
If you wanna get down, I'm gonna
show you the way

01:04:58.536 --> 01:05:00.636
Whoomp, there it is, let me hear
you say

01:05:00.671 --> 01:05:02.789
Whoomp, there it is! Come on, y'all

01:05:02.824 --> 01:05:04.865
Whoomp! There it is a little louder

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:06.908
Whoomp, there it is! Come on, y'all

01:05:06.943 --> 01:05:08.576
Whoomp, there it is!

01:05:11.012 --> 01:05:11.479
Coming.

01:05:17.118 --> 01:05:18.536
Hi.

01:05:18.571 --> 01:05:19.919
Wow.

01:05:19.954 --> 01:05:21.689
You look miraculous.

01:05:21.724 --> 01:05:23.058
So do you.

01:05:23.093 --> 01:05:24.357
Thank you.

01:05:24.392 --> 01:05:26.394
What would you like to do?

01:05:26.429 --> 01:05:28.486
I got some ideas.

01:05:32.566 --> 01:05:36.503
Just reach out in front of you and
and take a sip.

01:05:36.538 --> 01:05:39.961
Don't look. There you go.

01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:43.576
Well?

01:05:43.944 --> 01:05:46.647
It tastes like a crappy cup
of coffee.

01:05:46.682 --> 01:05:48.911
No.

01:05:50.484 --> 01:05:52.184
It is a crappy cup of coffee.

01:05:52.219 --> 01:05:54.685
No, it's the world's best cup
of coffee.

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:58.458
The trick is to not get your arm caught
in the door!

01:05:58.493 --> 01:06:01.959
Also, never close your eyes' cause
then

01:06:01.994 --> 01:06:05.665
Okay, when you feel comfortable, you
just jump in!

01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:07.398
what are you doing?

01:06:07.433 --> 01:06:10.486
I'm skipping. I'm skipping.
I'm skipping.

01:06:10.521 --> 01:06:13.539
Wait, wait, wait... one more, one more.

01:06:13.574 --> 01:06:16.235
Now, look at the size of this one.

01:06:21.746 --> 01:06:23.611
Come with me.

01:06:24.449 --> 01:06:25.549
Watch out.

01:06:25.584 --> 01:06:27.615
Yellow ones don't stop.

01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:29.647
The yellow ones don't stop.

01:06:35.127 --> 01:06:39.257
Wow... that's a big one.

01:07:00.017 --> 01:07:01.368
I'm sorry.

01:07:01.403 --> 01:07:02.685
You missed.

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:04.655
What do you mean I missed?

01:07:04.690 --> 01:07:06.178
You missed.

01:07:26.009 --> 01:07:27.610
Miles finch.

01:07:27.645 --> 01:07:29.211
Miles finch.

01:07:31.146 --> 01:07:33.046
Miles finch.

01:07:35.617 --> 01:07:36.984
All right, let's do this.

01:07:37.019 --> 01:07:39.354
Miles, I'm so happy you could come
Uh...

01:07:39.389 --> 01:07:39.720
Yeah.

01:07:39.755 --> 01:07:42.391
I'm Walter Hobbs. Yeah, let's get
the, uh...

01:07:42.426 --> 01:07:45.027
Taken care of so we can get started
here.

01:07:45.062 --> 01:07:46.756
Here you go.

01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:49.696
Great.

01:07:49.731 --> 01:07:52.217
All right... clears throat

01:07:52.252 --> 01:07:54.702
What have you guys got so far?

01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:56.037
Go ahead.

01:07:56.072 --> 01:07:57.303
Uh...

01:07:57.338 --> 01:08:00.575
We were thinking, uh, something
like this, uh...

01:08:00.610 --> 01:08:02.542
We open on a young tomato.

01:08:02.577 --> 01:08:04.712
He's had some tough times down
at the farm

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:06.581
With, you know, a rabbit, and...

01:08:06.616 --> 01:08:08.166
No. No tomatoes...

01:08:08.201 --> 01:08:09.682
Too vulnerable.

01:08:09.717 --> 01:08:11.268
Kids, they're already vulnerable.

01:08:11.303 --> 01:08:12.996
No, you see? I... I told you guys.

01:08:13.031 --> 01:08:14.689
I told them the very same thing...

01:08:14.724 --> 01:08:15.321
And no farms.

01:08:15.356 --> 01:08:17.792
Every body's pushing small town
rural.

01:08:17.827 --> 01:08:20.227
A farm book would just be white
noise.

01:08:20.261 --> 01:08:21.059
What about this?

01:08:21.094 --> 01:08:24.062
Uh, a tribe of asparagus children,

01:08:24.096 --> 01:08:28.727
But they're self-conscious about
the way their pee smells.

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:35.774
Apparently, all we have is
vegetables.

01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:37.060
I have no time, so, you know,

01:08:37.095 --> 01:08:38.276
If you've got a story here...

01:08:38.310 --> 01:08:41.113
I've got about five or six great
starts here.

01:08:41.149 --> 01:08:43.182
I've got one idea that
I'm especially

01:08:43.216 --> 01:08:45.401
Psyched out of my mind about.

01:08:45.435 --> 01:08:47.295
You know, it's one of those ideas

01:08:47.330 --> 01:08:49.154
Where you're just like, uh...

01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:50.054
Yes!

01:08:50.089 --> 01:08:52.288
Whoa!

01:08:52.323 --> 01:08:54.692
Uh, great, c-could we hear it?

01:08:54.727 --> 01:08:58.096
I'll start with the cover.
Picture this... you got, uh

01:08:58.131 --> 01:09:00.867
Dad! I'm in love, I'm in love,

01:09:00.902 --> 01:09:03.602
And I don't care who knows it!

01:09:03.636 --> 01:09:04.301
Buddy, not now, uh,

01:09:04.336 --> 01:09:06.620
Can you please go back to the...
to the pit?

01:09:06.654 --> 01:09:08.906
I'll come and visit you in a
little while, okay?

01:09:08.941 --> 01:09:12.375
I didn't know you had elves
working here.

01:09:12.410 --> 01:09:17.314
Oh... boy, you're... you're hilarious,
my friend.

01:09:17.350 --> 01:09:19.582
He doesn't, uh... get back to

01:09:19.617 --> 01:09:22.287
The story, please. All right, okay.

01:09:23.421 --> 01:09:24.886
So, on the cover above the title...

01:09:24.921 --> 01:09:27.274
Does Santa know that you left the
workshop?

01:09:27.309 --> 01:09:29.591
You know, we're all laughing our
heads off.

01:09:29.627 --> 01:09:31.761
Did you have to borrow a reindeer
to get down here?

01:09:31.796 --> 01:09:33.630
Buddy... go back to the basement.

01:09:33.665 --> 01:09:35.162
Hey, jack weed,

01:09:35.198 --> 01:09:36.765
I get more action in a week

01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:38.166
Than you've had your entire life.

01:09:38.201 --> 01:09:41.805
I've got houses in I.e., Paris,
and Vail,

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:43.205
Oh. Each one of them

01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:45.242
with a 70-inchplasma screen.

01:09:45.277 --> 01:09:46.707
So, I suggest you wipe

01:09:46.743 --> 01:09:48.109
That stupid smile off your face

01:09:48.145 --> 01:09:50.714
Before I come over there and smack
it off!

01:09:50.749 --> 01:09:52.381
You feeling strong, my friend?!

01:09:52.417 --> 01:09:55.817
Call me elf one more time!

01:09:59.789 --> 01:10:02.656
He's an angry elf.

01:10:05.361 --> 01:10:08.262
Look at you.

01:10:10.199 --> 01:10:12.168
Ow! Hey, what...

01:10:12.203 --> 01:10:12.933
Aah!

01:10:12.968 --> 01:10:14.670
I wasn't ready for that.

01:10:14.705 --> 01:10:16.956
Aah! Hey, hey, hey!

01:10:16.991 --> 01:10:19.208
Hey, hey, hey! Whoa!

01:10:19.243 --> 01:10:19.673
Ooh...

01:10:19.708 --> 01:10:21.676
Call me elf one more time!

01:10:21.711 --> 01:10:23.457
Call me elf!

01:10:23.492 --> 01:10:25.203
You're an elf.

01:10:30.518 --> 01:10:34.249
Miles, I'm sorry, he... he thinks
he's an elf.

01:10:35.190 --> 01:10:35.989
Listen, miles...

01:10:36.024 --> 01:10:38.523
Listen, miles! Door slams

01:10:38.558 --> 01:10:41.023
He must be a South Pole elf.

01:10:43.365 --> 01:10:45.049
You get the hell outta here.

01:10:45.084 --> 01:10:46.392
Where do you want me to go?

01:10:46.427 --> 01:10:47.666
I don't care where you go.

01:10:47.701 --> 01:10:48.969
I don't care that you're an elf!

01:10:49.004 --> 01:10:50.738
I don't care that you're nuts!

01:10:50.773 --> 01:10:52.473
I don't care that you're my son!

01:10:52.508 --> 01:10:55.408
Get out of my life now!

01:11:05.853 --> 01:11:06.852
Hi, it's me.

01:11:06.887 --> 01:11:08.419
I really can't talk right now.

01:11:08.454 --> 01:11:10.722
Well, just tell me how the pitch
went.

01:11:10.757 --> 01:11:13.526
I'm gonna be a little later than
I thought, okay?

01:11:13.561 --> 01:11:15.795
Well, don't be too late, Walter,

01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:17.547
It's Christmas Eve.

01:11:17.582 --> 01:11:19.230
Walter... wait, um.

01:11:19.265 --> 01:11:21.401
Honey, I gotta go, okay? Love ya.

01:11:21.436 --> 01:11:23.562
Oh, say hi to buddy.

01:11:24.437 --> 01:11:26.037
What? Walter, breakthrough.

01:11:26.072 --> 01:11:28.307
We found this in the conference
room.

01:11:28.342 --> 01:11:28.773
What is it?

01:11:28.808 --> 01:11:30.708
It's miles finch's notebook.

01:11:30.743 --> 01:11:33.912
This thing is chock full of
genius ideas.

01:11:33.947 --> 01:11:34.544
I mean, look at that.

01:11:34.579 --> 01:11:38.450
And his best idea is about a
peach that lives on a farm.

01:11:38.485 --> 01:11:40.752
What's more vulnerable than a
peach?

01:11:40.787 --> 01:11:41.385
What, uh, what do we do?

01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:44.756
I think we should go with the
first pitch... it's genius.

01:11:44.791 --> 01:11:45.389
Uh, how much time we got?

01:11:45.424 --> 01:11:47.292
We got, like, 45 minutes. Well,
come on, let's, uh,

01:11:47.327 --> 01:11:49.294
Try to get a storyboard or
something ready.

01:11:49.329 --> 01:11:50.527
Come on, let's do it. Just try.

01:11:50.562 --> 01:11:53.064
No, you can't sit down and get a
storyboard ready.

01:11:53.099 --> 01:11:54.599
Go and get a storyboard ready.

01:11:54.634 --> 01:11:56.862
Oh, boy! Go.

01:11:59.503 --> 01:12:03.038
"I'm sorry I ruined your lives

01:12:03.073 --> 01:12:07.977
"And crammed 11 cookies into
the vcr.

01:12:08.012 --> 01:12:13.416
"I don't belong here. I don't
belong anywhere.

01:12:13.851 --> 01:12:19.390
I'll never forget you. Love,
buddy."

01:12:19.425 --> 01:12:20.823
God...

01:12:31.968 --> 01:12:33.492
Hey, buddy.

01:12:36.105 --> 01:12:37.572
Buddy?

01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:45.547
As you know, we need a big
launch fast

01:12:45.582 --> 01:12:46.880
To get the company back on
track.

01:12:46.915 --> 01:12:50.152
So, I think I speak for my fellow
board members

01:12:50.187 --> 01:12:53.322
When I say... this better be good.

01:12:53.357 --> 01:12:55.908
Before I get into the story, uh,

01:12:55.943 --> 01:12:58.460
Let me start with the cover, okay?

01:12:58.495 --> 01:13:00.763
Now, just picture this...

01:13:00.798 --> 01:13:02.715
Dad! I gotta talk to you.

01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:04.633
Michael, what is it?

01:13:04.668 --> 01:13:05.866
Buddy ran away.

01:13:05.901 --> 01:13:08.286
What? He... he left a note.

01:13:08.321 --> 01:13:10.636
I'm scared, dad, he's gone.

01:13:10.671 --> 01:13:13.140
Uh, let me just finish this
meeting,

01:13:13.175 --> 01:13:15.575
And then, um, we'll figure it
out, okay?

01:13:15.610 --> 01:13:20.014
Figure out what? Buddy cares
about everybody.

01:13:20.049 --> 01:13:22.175
All you care about is yourself.

01:13:23.918 --> 01:13:26.409
Hey, Michael.

01:13:27.088 --> 01:13:28.555
Wait.

01:13:31.859 --> 01:13:35.362
We're gonna have to reschedule
this, uh, Mr. Greenway.

01:13:35.397 --> 01:13:36.780
We don't have time to reschedule.

01:13:36.815 --> 01:13:38.164
I wanna hear the damn thing now.

01:13:38.199 --> 01:13:39.331
Son, you'll have to wait.

01:13:39.366 --> 01:13:43.393
No, d-don't tell my kid what
to do, uh...

01:13:43.937 --> 01:13:46.907
Can't... can't we do this another
time, Mr. Greenway?

01:13:46.942 --> 01:13:49.709
I flew in just to hear this pitch,

01:13:49.744 --> 01:13:51.009
And I intend to.

01:13:51.044 --> 01:13:52.511
It's gonna have to wait.

01:13:52.546 --> 01:13:54.546
If you wanna keep your job, Hobbs,

01:13:54.581 --> 01:13:57.550
You will pitch me this book
right now.

01:14:04.557 --> 01:14:07.605
Well... up yours.

01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:10.654
Yeah, up yours. Hey.

01:14:12.064 --> 01:14:13.564
Hobbs... Hobbs!

01:14:13.599 --> 01:14:15.366
Hobbs, you walk out of here,

01:14:15.401 --> 01:14:17.937
And... and you're finished at
greenway!

01:14:17.972 --> 01:14:19.495
You're finished!

01:14:36.721 --> 01:14:39.713
I don't belong anywhere.

01:14:41.993 --> 01:14:43.978
Buddy!

01:14:44.013 --> 01:14:45.929
Buddy!

01:14:45.964 --> 01:14:48.124
Buddy, where are you?!

01:14:55.606 --> 01:15:00.010
Prancer, pull! Come on! Come on!

01:15:00.045 --> 01:15:03.580
Vixen, up, up!

01:15:03.615 --> 01:15:05.707
Santa?

01:15:06.116 --> 01:15:09.119
Come on, you can do it.

01:15:09.154 --> 01:15:12.747
Pull up! Pull up!

01:15:20.596 --> 01:15:22.663
Dad! What?

01:15:22.698 --> 01:15:24.200
Michael, where you going?

01:15:24.235 --> 01:15:25.565
Michael!

01:15:43.685 --> 01:15:44.050
Santa.

01:15:44.085 --> 01:15:48.790
Back off, slick. You'll scare
the deer.

01:15:48.825 --> 01:15:51.559
Buddy, is that you?

01:15:51.594 --> 01:15:52.492
Are you okay?

01:15:52.527 --> 01:15:55.095
Boy, am I glad to see you.

01:15:55.130 --> 01:15:59.034
The Claus meter suddenly just
dropped down to zero.

01:15:59.069 --> 01:16:02.670
There's just no Christmas
spirit anymore.

01:16:02.705 --> 01:16:05.684
And then the strain was too
Much...

01:16:05.719 --> 01:16:08.664
The engine broke free of her
mounts.

01:16:13.647 --> 01:16:16.181
I need an elf's help.

01:16:16.216 --> 01:16:18.718
I... I'm not an elf, Santa.

01:16:18.753 --> 01:16:21.186
I... I can't do anything right.

01:16:21.221 --> 01:16:26.059
Buddy, you're more of an elf than
anyone I ever met,

01:16:26.094 --> 01:16:28.462
And the only one who I would want

01:16:28.497 --> 01:16:30.830
Working on my sleigh tonight.

01:16:30.865 --> 01:16:32.764
Really? Really.

01:16:32.799 --> 01:16:35.418
Will you fix it for me, buddy?

01:16:35.453 --> 01:16:38.037
I'll try. Papa taught me how.

01:16:38.072 --> 01:16:38.836
You gotta find it first.

01:16:38.871 --> 01:16:41.674
It dropped off the sleigh back
over there a ways.

01:16:41.709 --> 01:16:44.610
The engine? The engine, yeah.

01:16:44.645 --> 01:16:47.714
Go, buddy. Go, Mr. Elf!

01:16:49.114 --> 01:16:50.747
I'm standing here outside
central park

01:16:50.782 --> 01:16:54.319
Where it is unclear exactly
what has happened.

01:16:54.354 --> 01:16:56.221
What we do know is that
authorities

01:16:56.256 --> 01:16:57.054
Have closed the park

01:16:57.089 --> 01:16:58.321
And are in the process of
clearing it.

01:16:58.356 --> 01:17:01.093
The only thing that people can
seem to agree on here

01:17:01.128 --> 01:17:04.596
Is that they saw something fall
from the sky.

01:17:04.631 --> 01:17:05.829
I've got an eyewitness with me

01:17:05.864 --> 01:17:08.066
Who claims to have seen the whole
thing firsthand.

01:17:08.101 --> 01:17:09.266
What did you actually see?

01:17:09.301 --> 01:17:11.837
You know, I was walking around and
I saw this thing,

01:17:11.872 --> 01:17:14.105
And my daughter actually pointed
it out to me.

01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:15.173
Oh, your daughter saw it?

01:17:15.208 --> 01:17:16.172
Sweetheart, can you tell me

01:17:16.207 --> 01:17:18.576
What you saw falling out of the
sky?

01:17:18.611 --> 01:17:20.277
It was Santa's sleigh!

01:17:21.912 --> 01:17:23.781
Santa's sleigh, well, there you
have it.

01:17:23.816 --> 01:17:24.613
Santa's in Manhattan.

01:17:24.648 --> 01:17:27.818
Sorry to interrupt your first big
news story, charlotte,

01:17:27.853 --> 01:17:29.988
But New York one has just received

01:17:30.023 --> 01:17:32.124
Some exclusive amateur news footage

01:17:32.159 --> 01:17:34.190
That you just might Anna follow
up on.

01:17:34.225 --> 01:17:37.627
There seems to be a strange man
dressed as an elf

01:17:37.662 --> 01:17:39.094
Wandering through central park.

01:17:39.129 --> 01:17:42.132
Now, I don't know if this is the
kind of hard-hitting news

01:17:42.167 --> 01:17:44.167
You're used to covering in buffalo,
charlotte,

01:17:44.202 --> 01:17:45.769
Oh, my god. But here at New York one,

01:17:45.804 --> 01:17:48.260
News is top priority.

01:17:58.782 --> 01:18:01.283
What the heck...?

01:18:01.318 --> 01:18:03.183
Hey!

01:18:03.619 --> 01:18:06.315
You found it. Buddy!

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:13.211
I need to tell you something.

01:18:13.246 --> 01:18:14.321
No, no. Buddy, there's something

01:18:14.356 --> 01:18:15.362
I have to tell you right now.

01:18:15.397 --> 01:18:19.268
Um, I didn't mean anything I said back
there, not word.

01:18:19.303 --> 01:18:23.305
I know you may be a little, um, um...

01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:24.705
Uh, chemically imbalanced,

01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:27.475
But you've been right about a lot
of things.

01:18:27.510 --> 01:18:30.909
I... I don't want you to leave.

01:18:30.944 --> 01:18:34.308
You're my son, and I... love you.

01:18:41.656 --> 01:18:42.421
Uh, buddy, uh...

01:18:42.456 --> 01:18:45.326
What was it you wanted to tell me?

01:18:45.361 --> 01:18:47.695
Oh, right. Come with me.

01:18:47.730 --> 01:18:49.492
Right. Come on.

01:18:55.735 --> 01:18:57.169
I'm herewith another eyewitness

01:18:57.204 --> 01:18:59.506
Who has his own version of what
happened.

01:18:59.541 --> 01:19:00.639
Sir, what did you see?

01:19:00.674 --> 01:19:01.873
I think you're great, charlotte.

01:19:01.908 --> 01:19:03.693
Uh, I saw something fall from the
sky

01:19:03.728 --> 01:19:05.478
Right into the middle of central
park.

01:19:05.513 --> 01:19:07.848
I mean, you're a great news lady.

01:19:07.883 --> 01:19:08.647
Thank you.

01:19:08.682 --> 01:19:09.681
Could you tell me a bit more?

01:19:09.716 --> 01:19:11.034
About what you saw fall from the
sky?

01:19:11.069 --> 01:19:12.317
Yeah, yeah. Your eyes tell the
story,

01:19:12.352 --> 01:19:14.353
That's what I love about you.
You've got a great mouth.

01:19:14.388 --> 01:19:16.806
The thing just dropped in the middle of
central park.

01:19:16.841 --> 01:19:19.225
It was amazing, and everybody's, like,
going crazy.

01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:21.193
Dick, uh, according to authorities,

01:19:21.228 --> 01:19:22.393
The area has been cleared.

01:19:22.428 --> 01:19:25.998
Only the central park rangers now
remain in the park.

01:19:26.033 --> 01:19:27.833
These forces are highly trained,

01:19:27.868 --> 01:19:29.200
But rarely see action.

01:19:29.235 --> 01:19:32.371
Some have accused them of being
too gung ho

01:19:32.406 --> 01:19:33.270
When called into duty,

01:19:33.305 --> 01:19:36.041
And their controversial crowd
control tactics

01:19:36.076 --> 01:19:38.776
At the Simon and Garfunkel concert
in '85

01:19:38.811 --> 01:19:41.112
Are still under investigation.

01:19:41.147 --> 01:19:43.379
I knew you'd find it, Mr. Elf!

01:19:43.414 --> 01:19:46.747
Slap it on real quick, we've got
to get going.

01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:50.388
That ta boy.

01:19:53.424 --> 01:19:56.156
So, uh... you're, uh...

01:19:56.191 --> 01:19:58.889
Santa Claus. Right.

01:20:00.031 --> 01:20:04.001
Would you mind taking this to
your firstborn?

01:20:04.036 --> 01:20:04.499
Sure.

01:20:04.534 --> 01:20:07.738
Um, uh, and my firstborn, he's
an elf?

01:20:07.773 --> 01:20:11.401
Yes. Actually, I'm adopted.

01:20:11.742 --> 01:20:15.769
Uh, Michael, would you open this
hatch for me, please?

01:20:21.451 --> 01:20:23.518
That ta boy, thank you.

01:20:23.553 --> 01:20:27.256
So, you're really Santa Claus?

01:20:27.291 --> 01:20:29.992
You never can tell, kid.

01:20:30.027 --> 01:20:30.825
Tell me, Michael,

01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:32.561
What do you want for Christmas?

01:20:32.596 --> 01:20:35.715
I wanted a skateboard.

01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:39.277
Oh, not just skateboard.

01:20:39.312 --> 01:20:42.805
Arealhuf board. Looked here.

01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:44.238
Looked here...

01:20:44.273 --> 01:20:46.342
How do you like them apples?

01:20:46.377 --> 01:20:49.072
Go look and see.

01:20:55.383 --> 01:20:56.850
Whoa.

01:21:03.558 --> 01:21:04.557
What happened?

01:21:04.592 --> 01:21:07.329
You made my sleigh fly.

01:21:07.364 --> 01:21:08.061
What do you mean?

01:21:08.096 --> 01:21:10.263
Well, before the turbine days,

01:21:10.298 --> 01:21:13.301
This baby used to run solely on
Christmas spirit.

01:21:13.336 --> 01:21:16.721
You believed in me. You made my
sleigh fly.

01:21:16.756 --> 01:21:20.072
Hold it... if you're really Santa
Claus,

01:21:20.107 --> 01:21:22.543
Then we can just get some news
cameras in here,

01:21:22.578 --> 01:21:23.761
And everyone will believe in you,

01:21:23.796 --> 01:21:24.910
Then your sleigh will fly, right?

01:21:24.945 --> 01:21:27.948
Christmas spirit is about believing,
not seeing.

01:21:27.983 --> 01:21:30.916
If the whole world saw me,
all would be lost.

01:21:30.951 --> 01:21:35.122
The paparazzi have been trying to
nail me for years.

01:21:37.925 --> 01:21:39.392
Hey, look!

01:21:48.334 --> 01:21:52.105
It's the central park rangers.

01:21:56.342 --> 01:22:01.644
Dad, Michael... I got a plan.

01:22:09.388 --> 01:22:12.089
Whoa, wait! Wait, Michael...
my list!

01:22:12.124 --> 01:22:14.893
You bring that list back right now,
you hear me?!

01:22:14.928 --> 01:22:16.962
Come on, give me your hat and coat.

01:22:16.997 --> 01:22:19.897
Mrs. Claus made them for me.

01:22:24.169 --> 01:22:27.161
Hey! Hey, here I am!

01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:29.972
Ho ho ho!

01:22:30.007 --> 01:22:34.671
Hey, ho ho ho! Hey! Hey!

01:22:42.053 --> 01:22:44.086
Excuse me. Thank you. Excuse me.

01:22:44.121 --> 01:22:46.057
So the authorities have not
discovered

01:22:46.092 --> 01:22:47.890
Any reindeer in the park?

01:22:47.925 --> 01:22:49.443
No, no reindeer. Sleigh bells?

01:22:49.478 --> 01:22:50.703
No, no sleigh bells, either.

01:22:50.738 --> 01:22:51.894
Elves? Excuse me, please.

01:22:51.929 --> 01:22:53.096
None of that, we really just
need everyone...

01:22:53.131 --> 01:22:54.162
It's him, it's the real Santa!

01:22:54.197 --> 01:22:55.965
His sleigh won't fly,' cause nobody
believes in him!

01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:57.901
Did you see something
in the park?

01:22:57.936 --> 01:22:58.533
Everyone out there,

01:22:58.568 --> 01:23:01.071
Santa needs us to believe,
I can prove he's real.

01:23:01.106 --> 01:23:01.903
Look, this is his list!

01:23:01.938 --> 01:23:04.906
Okay... well, further confirmation

01:23:04.941 --> 01:23:07.510
That there has been a Santa
sighting tonight.

01:23:07.545 --> 01:23:08.610
We have the naughty and nice list.

01:23:08.645 --> 01:23:10.947
Lynn Kessler wants a power puff
girls play set.

01:23:11.448 --> 01:23:13.416
Mark weber wants an electric
guitar.

01:23:13.451 --> 01:23:13.715
Yes!

01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:17.586
Carolyn Reynolds wants a Suzy-
talks-a-lot.

01:23:17.621 --> 01:23:18.688
Thanks, buddy.

01:23:18.723 --> 01:23:19.720
Dirk Lawson wants

01:23:19.755 --> 01:23:21.055
A day of pampering at burke
Williams spa.

01:23:21.090 --> 01:23:25.220
Stan Tobias wants a power pumper
water pistol.

01:23:26.028 --> 01:23:27.194
Must be another dirk Lawson.

01:23:27.229 --> 01:23:29.648
Dave keckler wants some Nike
shocks.

01:23:29.683 --> 01:23:31.842
Okay, uh, well, obviously we have

01:23:31.877 --> 01:23:33.967
A new development in the story, uh,

01:23:34.002 --> 01:23:36.605
A confirmation that Santa must
have been sighted

01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:38.440
Because we have his book right
here.

01:23:38.475 --> 01:23:40.174
what's your name?

01:23:40.209 --> 01:23:43.544
Uh, I'm charlotte den on, New York one.

01:23:43.579 --> 01:23:46.104
"D," "D..."

01:23:46.714 --> 01:23:49.116
Charlotte den on wants tiffany

01:23:49.151 --> 01:23:51.519
And for her boyfriend to stop

01:23:51.554 --> 01:23:52.587
And commit already.

01:23:57.525 --> 01:23:58.424
We've got power!

01:23:58.459 --> 01:24:00.726

01:24:00.761 --> 01:24:02.597
Hey, turn the cameras back on!

01:24:02.632 --> 01:24:03.764
Who told you to say that?

01:24:03.799 --> 01:24:04.630
It's the real Santa.

01:24:04.665 --> 01:24:06.766
We need to get these cameras
back on.

01:24:06.801 --> 01:24:07.933
He needs our help!

01:24:07.968 --> 01:24:10.303
Hey, Michael, are you okay?

01:24:10.338 --> 01:24:10.969
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:24:11.004 --> 01:24:14.274
But buddy, he's... he's in the
park with Santa,

01:24:14.309 --> 01:24:15.474
The sleigh won't fly

01:24:15.509 --> 01:24:17.511
'cause there's no Christmas
spirit.

01:24:17.546 --> 01:24:20.381
Michael! Mom!

01:24:20.416 --> 01:24:23.181
Michael! Ohh!

01:24:23.216 --> 01:24:25.484
Are you okay? I'm fine.

01:24:25.519 --> 01:24:28.522
The best way to spread
Christmas cheer

01:24:28.557 --> 01:24:32.651
Is singing loud for all
to hear.

01:24:36.996 --> 01:24:39.865
Buddy... better get going,
get in now!

01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:42.735
Santa, I'm not done with the
engine yet!

01:24:42.770 --> 01:24:44.001
Can't wait!

01:24:44.036 --> 01:24:46.522
On, dasher, on, dancer...

01:24:46.557 --> 01:24:49.008
I'm not done with the engine!

01:24:52.845 --> 01:24:54.010
That's okay.

01:24:54.045 --> 01:24:57.344
You get started, I'll catch up!

01:25:02.220 --> 01:25:04.772
You know, he wasn't lying.

01:25:04.807 --> 01:25:07.325
Merry Christmas.

01:25:12.163 --> 01:25:14.063
Santa, I can't...

01:25:14.098 --> 01:25:16.701
Stop messing around and get in!

01:25:16.736 --> 01:25:20.033
Aah!

01:25:25.075 --> 01:25:27.177
Santa, why are they chasing us?!

01:25:27.212 --> 01:25:29.279
I put the mon the naughty list,

01:25:29.314 --> 01:25:31.713
And they never forgave me.

01:25:37.087 --> 01:25:40.907
You better watch out,
you better not cry

01:25:40.942 --> 01:25:44.727
You better not pout,
I'm telling you why

01:25:44.762 --> 01:25:49.665
Santa Clausis coming' to town

01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:54.569
Yaah, yaah, yaah!

01:25:55.638 --> 01:25:57.672
Up, up, pull up!

01:25:57.707 --> 01:26:02.044
Buddy! We need power, we're
gonna crash!

01:26:02.079 --> 01:26:06.149
He's making a list,
Checking it twice

01:26:06.184 --> 01:26:10.218
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

01:26:10.253 --> 01:26:15.724
Santa clausis coming' to town

01:26:15.759 --> 01:26:21.196
He sees you when you're sleeping

01:26:21.231 --> 01:26:24.064
He knows when you're awake

01:26:24.099 --> 01:26:27.902
He knows if you've been bad or good

01:26:27.937 --> 01:26:30.637
So be good for goodness sake

01:26:30.672 --> 01:26:35.008
Oh, you better watch out,
you better not cry

01:26:35.043 --> 01:26:39.346
You better not pout, I'm telling
you why

01:26:39.381 --> 01:26:45.410
Santa Clausis coming to town

01:26:51.759 --> 01:26:52.791
Aah!

01:26:52.826 --> 01:26:55.396
You can do it!
Come on, dancer.

01:26:55.431 --> 01:26:57.397
That's my boy.

01:26:57.432 --> 01:26:59.449
Pull, cupid! Aah!

01:26:59.484 --> 01:27:01.432
Pull, dasher!

01:27:01.467 --> 01:27:05.638
I'm getting too old for this job.

01:27:05.673 --> 01:27:07.162
Now!

01:27:20.452 --> 01:27:22.154
The engine's gone!

01:27:22.189 --> 01:27:23.388
We're toast!

01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:31.194
Well, still no sign of Santa,

01:27:31.229 --> 01:27:33.298
But some spontaneous Christmas
caroling

01:27:33.333 --> 01:27:34.197
Has broken out

01:27:34.232 --> 01:27:36.268
Right herein front of central
park.

01:27:36.303 --> 01:27:37.301
Let's have a listen in.

01:27:37.336 --> 01:27:39.171
He sees you when you're sleeping

01:27:39.206 --> 01:27:42.673
He knows if you're awake

01:27:42.708 --> 01:27:46.677
He knows if you've been bad or
good

01:27:46.712 --> 01:27:50.481
So be good for goodness sake

01:27:50.516 --> 01:27:50.913
Hey!

01:27:50.948 --> 01:27:54.718
You better watch out, you better
not cry

01:27:54.753 --> 01:27:58.489
You better not pout, I'm telling
you why

01:27:58.524 --> 01:27:58.854
Come on!

01:27:58.889 --> 01:28:03.174
Santa claus is coming' to town

01:28:03.209 --> 01:28:07.459
Just a little more!

01:28:12.502 --> 01:28:13.702
Hal-yah!

01:28:13.737 --> 01:28:16.373
He knows when you're awake

01:28:16.408 --> 01:28:17.672
He knows if you've

01:28:17.707 --> 01:28:20.243
Wait... you're not singing.

01:28:20.278 --> 01:28:21.242
Yes, I am.

01:28:21.277 --> 01:28:24.481
No, you're not. You're just moving
your lips.

01:28:24.516 --> 01:28:26.314
Santa!

01:28:26.349 --> 01:28:28.952
Michael, please, what's the big deal?

01:28:28.987 --> 01:28:29.718
Dad.

01:28:29.753 --> 01:28:30.719
I'm telling you why

01:28:30.754 --> 01:28:36.521
Santa clausis coming to town

01:28:44.900 --> 01:28:46.867
Oh! Ha ha ha!

01:28:46.902 --> 01:28:49.037
Now, my beauties!

01:28:56.278 --> 01:28:57.377
Bye-bye.

01:28:57.412 --> 01:28:58.778
Just like the old days!

01:28:58.813 --> 01:29:01.848
Charlotte? Charlotte?

01:29:01.883 --> 01:29:04.585
Well, I guess we'll never know for
sure

01:29:04.620 --> 01:29:06.587
What happened this Christmas Eve?

01:29:06.622 --> 01:29:07.920
In central park.

01:29:07.955 --> 01:29:14.095
Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!

01:29:14.130 --> 01:29:16.996
Ho ho ho!

01:29:17.031 --> 01:29:19.932
And so, with a little help,

01:29:19.967 --> 01:29:21.900
Buddy managed to save Christmas.

01:29:21.935 --> 01:29:24.838
And his spirit saved a lot of other
People, too.

01:29:24.873 --> 01:29:31.611
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

01:29:31.646 --> 01:29:37.949
And never brought to mind

01:29:37.984 --> 01:29:45.257
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

01:29:45.292 --> 01:29:48.828
Walter started his own independent
publishing company.

01:29:48.863 --> 01:29:51.581
His first book was written by a
brand new,

01:29:51.616 --> 01:29:54.300
Critically acclaimed children's
author.

01:29:54.335 --> 01:29:56.102
The book was elf...

01:29:56.137 --> 01:29:57.835
A, uh, fictional story

01:29:57.870 --> 01:29:59.972
About an adopted elf named buddy

01:30:00.007 --> 01:30:02.041
Who was raised in the North Pole?

01:30:02.076 --> 01:30:04.076
Went to New York, ate spaghetti,

01:30:04.111 --> 01:30:06.462
Worked in a shiny mailroom,

01:30:06.497 --> 01:30:08.779
And eventually saved Christmas.

01:30:08.814 --> 01:30:11.583
"First, I traveled through the
seven levels

01:30:11.618 --> 01:30:13.883
"Of the candy cane forest,

01:30:13.918 --> 01:30:18.488
"Past the sea of twirly-swirly
gumdrops,

01:30:18.523 --> 01:30:23.361
And then, I walked through the
Lincoln tunnel."

01:30:23.396 --> 01:30:25.595
And as for me, I can't complain.

01:30:25.630 --> 01:30:28.032
Buddy comes up to visit from time
to time.

01:30:28.067 --> 01:30:31.603
In the meadow we can build a
snowman

01:30:31.638 --> 01:30:35.103
And pretend that he is parson
brown

01:30:35.138 --> 01:30:38.342
Oh, thank you, Jovie. That's very
sweet of you.

01:30:38.377 --> 01:30:39.842
You're welcome, papa.

01:30:39.877 --> 01:30:43.881
But you can do the job when
you're in town

01:30:43.916 --> 01:30:45.380
Hey, Suzie.

01:30:45.415 --> 01:30:46.315
Come here, little one.

01:30:46.350 --> 01:30:48.886
When it snows, ain't it
thrilling?

01:30:48.921 --> 01:30:50.352
Papa wants to see you.

01:30:50.387 --> 01:30:53.991
Though your nose get a
little chilling

01:30:54.026 --> 01:30:54.356
Buddy...

01:30:54.391 --> 01:30:56.658
We'll frolic and play buddy...
buddy...

01:30:56.693 --> 01:31:02.961
The Eskimo way, walking in a
winter wonderland

01:31:20.216 --> 01:31:24.436
In the meadow we can build a
snowman

01:31:24.471 --> 01:31:28.622
And pretend that he is parson
brown

01:31:28.657 --> 01:31:33.061
He'll say, are you married,
we'll say no, man

01:31:33.096 --> 01:31:37.465
But you can do the job when you
in town, brother

01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:42.070
Later on, we'll conspire

01:31:42.105 --> 01:31:46.606
As we dream by the fire

01:31:46.641 --> 01:31:51.078
To face unafraid the plans
That we made

01:31:51.113 --> 01:31:55.411
Walking in a winter wonderland

01:31:55.446 --> 01:31:59.710
Walking in a winter wonderland

01:32:11.165 --> 01:32:12.597
I really can't stay

01:32:12.632 --> 01:32:17.136
But, baby, it's cold outside

01:32:17.171 --> 01:32:18.202
I've got to go 'way

01:32:18.237 --> 01:32:21.975
But, baby, it's cold outside

01:32:22.010 --> 01:32:24.242
This evening has been

01:32:24.277 --> 01:32:27.013
Been hoping that you'd drop in

01:32:27.048 --> 01:32:28.413
So very nice

01:32:28.448 --> 01:32:33.653
I'll hold your hands, they're
just like ice

01:32:33.688 --> 01:32:36.205
My mother will start to worry

01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:38.689
Beautiful, what's your hurry?

01:32:38.724 --> 01:32:42.127
And father will be pacing the floor

01:32:42.162 --> 01:32:44.663
Listen to that fireplace roar

01:32:44.698 --> 01:32:47.116
So, really, I'd better scurry

01:32:47.151 --> 01:32:49.499
Beautiful, please don't hurry

01:32:49.534 --> 01:32:52.670
Well, maybe just a half a drink more

01:32:52.705 --> 01:32:55.807
Put some records on while I pour

01:32:55.842 --> 01:32:58.193
The neighbors might think

01:32:58.228 --> 01:33:00.253
Baby, it's bad out there

01:33:00.288 --> 01:33:03.386
Say, what's in this drink?

01:33:03.421 --> 01:33:06.484
No cabs to be had out there

01:33:06.519 --> 01:33:08.184
I wish I knew how

01:33:08.219 --> 01:33:10.588
Your eyes are like starlight now

01:33:10.623 --> 01:33:12.521
To break the spell

01:33:12.556 --> 01:33:17.595
I'll take your hat, your hair
looks swell

01:33:17.630 --> 01:33:20.531
I ought to say no, no, no, sir

01:33:20.566 --> 01:33:22.632
Mind if I move in closer?

01:33:22.667 --> 01:33:25.852
At least I'm gonna say that I
tried

01:33:25.887 --> 01:33:29.039
What's the sense of hurting
my pride?

01:33:29.074 --> 01:33:30.941
I really can't stay

01:33:30.976 --> 01:33:32.774
Baby, don't hold out

01:33:32.809 --> 01:33:39.806
Ah, but it's cold outside

01:33:48.091 --> 01:33:49.323
I simply must go

01:33:49.358 --> 01:33:53.328
But, baby, it's cold outside

01:33:53.363 --> 01:33:55.262
The answer is no

01:33:55.297 --> 01:33:58.567
But, baby, it's cold outside

01:33:58.602 --> 01:34:00.334
This welcome has been

01:34:00.369 --> 01:34:03.072
I'm lucky that you dropped in

01:34:03.107 --> 01:34:05.005
So nice and warm

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:10.079
Look out the window at that
storm

01:34:10.114 --> 01:34:12.731
My sister will be suspicious

01:34:12.766 --> 01:34:15.314
Gosh, your lips look delicious

01:34:15.349 --> 01:34:18.586
My brother will be there at
the door

01:34:18.621 --> 01:34:20.787
Waves upon tropical shore

01:34:20.822 --> 01:34:23.558
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious

01:34:23.593 --> 01:34:26.259
Oh, your lips look delicious

01:34:26.294 --> 01:34:28.696
Well, maybe just a cigarette more

01:34:28.731 --> 01:34:32.233
Never such a pleasure before

01:34:32.268 --> 01:34:34.033
I've got to get home

01:34:34.068 --> 01:34:36.804
But, baby, you'll freeze out there

01:34:36.839 --> 01:34:38.603
Say, lend me your comb

01:34:38.638 --> 01:34:42.642
It's up to your knees out there

01:34:42.677 --> 01:34:44.710
You've really been grand

01:34:44.745 --> 01:34:46.780
I thrill when you touch my hand

01:34:46.815 --> 01:34:48.880
But don't you see

01:34:48.915 --> 01:34:52.652
How can you do this thing to me?

01:34:52.687 --> 01:34:56.389
There's bound to be talk tomorrow

01:34:56.424 --> 01:34:59.558
Think of my lifelong sorrow

01:34:59.593 --> 01:35:02.328
At least there will be plenty
implied

01:35:02.363 --> 01:35:05.331
If you caught pneumonia and died

01:35:05.366 --> 01:35:06.897
I really can't stay

01:35:06.932 --> 01:35:09.401
Get rid of that hold out

01:35:09.436 --> 01:35:13.405
Ah, but it's cold

01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:19.139
Outside

01:35:20.305 --> 01:35:26.884
