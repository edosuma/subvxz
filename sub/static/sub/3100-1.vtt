WEBVTT

00:51.803 --> 00:53.179
I don't know.

00:53.763 --> 00:56.474
Maybe we were doomed from the beginning.

00:57.934 --> 01:01.271
I mean, it's not like Dad was Mr. Sunshine.

01:03.523 --> 01:06.651
Sometimes I think all our problems
came directly from him.

01:08.152 --> 01:10.738
But a lot of the good stuff did, too.

01:13.408 --> 01:15.785
Remember what he always called us?

01:15.868 --> 01:17.704
The Gruesome Twosome.

01:18.663 --> 01:21.833
He told us to stick
together, no matter what.

01:30.174 --> 01:33.761
God! What the hell happened to us?

03:30.253 --> 03:31.295
Hello?

03:31.379 --> 03:32.880
Hi, is this Maggie Dean?

03:33.047 --> 03:34.048
Yes.

03:34.132 --> 03:35.633
This is L.A. Presbyterian Hospital.

03:35.758 --> 03:38.052
You know,
I'm on the National Do Not Call Registry.

03:38.136 --> 03:39.345
How did you get this number?

03:40.054 --> 03:42.515
I'm calling to inform you
that your brother Milo

03:42.598 --> 03:45.810
was admitted this afternoon
after an attempted suicide.

03:46.185 --> 03:47.687
He's okay.

03:51.482 --> 03:53.067
Ms. Dean?

03:53.776 --> 03:55.153
Yes.

03:55.528 --> 03:58.948
He's okay.
Good, thank you.

04:02.285 --> 04:04.912
It's a good thing he was
blasting his music.

04:04.996 --> 04:07.999
A neighbor complained
and got the building manager.

04:10.835 --> 04:12.503
Here's his note.

04:17.884 --> 04:19.135
"To whom it may concern..."

04:22.180 --> 04:23.514
Jesus.

04:24.766 --> 04:27.643
When was the last time you saw each other?

04:28.936 --> 04:30.521
About 10 years.

04:33.357 --> 04:34.692
Hey, Milo.

04:38.988 --> 04:40.364
Hey.

04:43.367 --> 04:44.702
You changed your hair.

04:45.161 --> 04:46.746
Oh, yeah. It's...

04:47.705 --> 04:50.333
It's been light for a while, I guess.

04:51.876 --> 04:53.294
Look at you.

04:53.586 --> 04:55.379
Yeah, look at me.

04:57.673 --> 05:00.009
Another tragic gay cliché.

05:05.473 --> 05:07.567
I don't know if you still
like apple fritters.

05:07.580 --> 05:09.685
Probably not as
good as Jensen's.

05:09.769 --> 05:11.562
I'm not really hungry.

05:14.232 --> 05:16.275
I'll just leave them here.

05:27.578 --> 05:29.831
How many days
did they say you have to be in here?

05:29.997 --> 05:31.499
A day or two.

05:33.084 --> 05:34.460
Do you have anyone...

05:36.045 --> 05:37.338
Do you live alone?

05:39.757 --> 05:41.509
Yeah, I live alone.

05:43.761 --> 05:46.138
Well, I'm around the next couple days,
if you need anything.

05:46.222 --> 05:48.023
Maggie, this was just
some stupid thing I did.

05:48.099 --> 05:50.977
I was drunk and feeling melodramatic, so...

05:53.020 --> 05:55.398
You didn't have to come here.

05:56.107 --> 05:57.859
You should go.

06:34.687 --> 06:35.897
Hey.

06:36.147 --> 06:37.982
They told me you were down here.

06:39.191 --> 06:40.818
I get discharged today.

06:40.902 --> 06:43.654
They just called me a cab.
I thought you were going home.

06:44.155 --> 06:45.823
Why, because you told me to?

06:45.907 --> 06:47.992
No, because I asked you to.

06:48.743 --> 06:50.536
What, are you king of the hospital now?

07:00.171 --> 07:01.797
Have you read Marley and Me?

07:01.964 --> 07:03.507
Yeah, sad.

07:04.050 --> 07:05.217
Why is it sad?

07:06.427 --> 07:07.548
You don't know what happens?

07:07.845 --> 07:09.513
No, that's why I'm reading it.

07:09.764 --> 07:11.515
Oh, sorry.

07:12.183 --> 07:13.726
What?
Nothing.

07:13.809 --> 07:16.520
What, does the dog die at the end?
No, I didn't say that.

07:16.604 --> 07:17.688
The fucking dog dies at the end.

07:17.772 --> 07:21.400
I didn't... I'm not saying anything.
Look how much I had left.

07:24.403 --> 07:26.280
I'm sorry I ruined it.

07:28.199 --> 07:30.910
Maggie, I know the dog dies.

07:31.702 --> 07:33.245
Everyone knows the dog dies.

07:33.621 --> 07:35.706
It's the book where the dog dies.

07:38.042 --> 07:39.460
Asshole.

07:39.794 --> 07:41.963
I see you're getting
your sense of humor back.

07:42.046 --> 07:44.423
Yeah, they can't take that away from me.

07:48.302 --> 07:50.054
I was thinking,

07:51.555 --> 07:53.557
maybe you'd wanna come stay with me?

07:54.100 --> 07:55.601
What, back to New York?

07:55.685 --> 07:59.146
Yeah. I mean just for a little bit,
until you feel better.

07:59.230 --> 08:02.733
I have a guest room
and you can meet Lance finally.

08:03.859 --> 08:06.153
Nyack's really beautiful this time of year.

08:06.404 --> 08:09.949
So the crack team of hospital crisis
counselors got to you, too, huh?

08:10.282 --> 08:12.910
This was my decision.
Yeah, whatever.

08:12.994 --> 08:14.912
They guilted you into this.

08:16.247 --> 08:18.874
You're right. It's probably a bad idea.

08:20.001 --> 08:21.502
Hey, Maggie.

08:24.255 --> 08:26.090
I have an aquarium

08:26.507 --> 08:31.178
full of very beloved, fat goldfish.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.605
You can get new goldfish in New York.

08:56.704 --> 08:58.497
Welcome home.

09:20.019 --> 09:21.812
Hey, here he is.

09:21.896 --> 09:23.314
Lance.
Yeah, sure am.

09:23.397 --> 09:24.398
How are ya? Great to meet you.

09:24.482 --> 09:25.775
Oh, shit. Sorry, man.

09:26.192 --> 09:28.986
It's okay. Don't worry about it.
They're healing over, so it's fine.

09:29.070 --> 09:31.322
I'm so psyched to finally meet you,
you know?

09:31.614 --> 09:33.365
Yeah, you, too.

09:33.574 --> 09:36.619
Mysterious Milo in the flesh, right?

09:37.078 --> 09:40.498
Well, actually, I'm clothed now,
so you'll have to get to know me

09:40.581 --> 09:43.167
a little bit better
before you see me in the flesh.

09:44.376 --> 09:46.253
Cool, cool.

09:46.337 --> 09:50.466
Well, hey, if you need anything,
I'm around, so don't hesitate to holler.

09:50.549 --> 09:51.949
I'm just... I'm doing a few chores.

09:51.967 --> 09:54.887
I will, I will, thank you.
Thanks for having me.

09:55.346 --> 09:56.972
Okay, take it easy, amigo.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.849
You, too, amigo.

10:06.065 --> 10:07.858
Jesus, Maggie.

10:10.361 --> 10:13.656
So, Milo, you hear about
your wild and crazy sister?

10:14.156 --> 10:16.283
Are you... He doesn't know?

10:16.492 --> 10:19.411
Your wild and crazy
sister has been taking...

10:19.745 --> 10:23.707
Give me a drumroll. Come on, drumroll.
Come on, louder.

10:23.958 --> 10:25.793
Scuba diving lessons.

10:26.168 --> 10:28.295
Yeah.
Doesn't that sound like fun?

10:28.379 --> 10:30.965
Yeah, if you like scuba diving, yeah.

10:31.048 --> 10:32.049
I do.

10:32.133 --> 10:34.635
She's preparing
for our tropical Hawaiian honeymoon.

10:34.718 --> 10:35.886
It's gonna be badass.

10:36.220 --> 10:37.221
Honeymoon?

10:37.304 --> 10:41.142
Better two years late than never.
It was her idea. It was your idea.

10:41.225 --> 10:42.643
Better late than never.
Yeah.

10:43.227 --> 10:44.979
She's always getting crazy ideas.

10:45.187 --> 10:48.983
Last month, it was salsa dancing.
Have you ever heard of salsa dancing?

10:49.066 --> 10:51.026
It's kind of like a
Spanish-flavored dancing?

10:51.110 --> 10:53.737
Yeah, yeah, the... Yeah.

10:53.821 --> 10:55.322
So now it's scuba diving. Yeah.

10:55.406 --> 10:56.448
You ever been?

10:57.408 --> 10:58.784
No, no.
No?

10:58.868 --> 11:00.995
Dude, you'd love it. It's awesome.
Right.

11:01.078 --> 11:04.456
Me and my buddy Craig,
a couple years ago, we went to Costa Rica.

11:04.665 --> 11:08.043
This was before Maggie was on the scene.
PM, Pre-Maggie.

11:08.127 --> 11:11.380
And the first time we go out on a dive,

11:12.381 --> 11:15.593
we saw an effing sea turtle,
which is very rare.

11:15.676 --> 11:18.220
Incredibly rare.
I think it's pretty normal, right?

11:18.304 --> 11:19.425
Seeing sea turtles?
What?

11:19.471 --> 11:21.682
When you're diving, seeing sea turtles?
I think that's very...

11:21.765 --> 11:23.642
No, I think you're thinking of
just regular turtles

11:23.726 --> 11:25.352
that you'd see in, like,
a pond or a stream.

11:25.436 --> 11:28.272
I'm talking about a sea turtle in the wild.

11:28.355 --> 11:32.526
We were swimming so close to it
that you could practically touch it.

11:33.277 --> 11:35.362
Is it okay if I tell him? Can I?
Nothing really to tell yet.

11:35.446 --> 11:36.739
You ready for some big news?

11:38.741 --> 11:42.161
We're trying to get pregnant.
Really?

11:42.244 --> 11:43.537
We are trying to get pregnant.
Yeah.

11:43.621 --> 11:47.458
And I say "we are,"
because it's not sexist that way.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.251
Right? That's what you told me.
Yeah.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.561
I thought you never wanted to have kids.

11:52.504 --> 11:54.548
Well, I may have said that
in high school or something,

11:54.632 --> 11:57.051
but obviously people
change their minds on that.

11:57.134 --> 11:58.594
No, I... That's great.

11:58.928 --> 12:00.179
I love kids.

12:00.346 --> 12:01.639
Except the fat ones.

12:01.931 --> 12:03.307
Fuck those little turds, right?

12:04.642 --> 12:06.685
He's kidding. He's being a smartass.

12:06.769 --> 12:08.437
Don't mind him.
I'm messing with you.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.189
I was like, "Whoa,
what's this guy got against fat kids?"

12:10.272 --> 12:11.982
No, he's...
I mean, I was a fat kid.

12:12.274 --> 12:14.235
Oh, you were?
I was built like a damn tank, yeah.

12:14.318 --> 12:16.111
She's seen the pictures.
It's pretty cute, though.

12:16.195 --> 12:18.364
I look like a... Just a
little pillow with legs.

12:18.447 --> 12:19.647
A little marshmallow.
Yeah.

12:19.657 --> 12:21.116
Hey, here's to you guys.

12:21.575 --> 12:24.828
Thanks.
May your kids be happy and fat.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.413
Cool, man, thanks.

12:26.497 --> 12:29.178
I mean, it hasn't happened yet,
but we're definitely giving it a go.

12:29.625 --> 12:31.001
Well, keep trying, 9W5-

12:31.502 --> 12:33.103
I can't wait to be the creepy gay uncle.

12:33.379 --> 12:34.797
You're hired.
Okay.

12:35.506 --> 12:36.674
You got the job.

12:41.262 --> 12:42.596
Hey!
Hey!

12:43.138 --> 12:44.723
Settling in?
Yeah.

12:44.932 --> 12:48.018
No, yeah, it's like
a Martha Stewart wonderland.

12:49.520 --> 12:52.940
So, you met Lance.

12:53.023 --> 12:55.192
Yeah, I met Lance.

12:55.943 --> 12:57.027
Isn't he the best?

12:57.152 --> 12:59.738
Yeah, he's like a big Labrador retriever.

13:00.489 --> 13:02.283
Yeah, I guess.

13:04.076 --> 13:06.996
He's just the nicest guy on the planet.

13:07.079 --> 13:08.789
I really lucked out.

13:08.872 --> 13:11.417
Yeah, you're really going for it.

13:13.419 --> 13:15.337
What does that mean?
You're going for it.

13:15.421 --> 13:19.758
Just, like, the job, the house,
the furniture. The Lance.

13:22.845 --> 13:24.221
I guess I grew up.

13:29.143 --> 13:31.186
So, what about you?
What about me?

13:31.478 --> 13:33.814
Well, last I heard,
you moved to L.A. to be an actor?

13:33.897 --> 13:35.691
That was, like, 10 years ago?

13:35.774 --> 13:38.360
Yeah, did you not hear'? I won an Oscar.
Oh, very funny.

13:38.444 --> 13:41.864
Yeah, I played a retarded
Ukrainian immigrant

13:41.947 --> 13:46.910
who inspires a bunch of school kids
in Brooklyn by playing chess.

13:47.911 --> 13:48.996
Seriously.
Seriously,

13:49.079 --> 13:52.166
acting's kinda hard
when you don't have an agent.

13:52.249 --> 13:55.085
So...
Well, what are you doing for money?

13:56.628 --> 13:58.672
Let me guess, male
prostitute joke coming...

13:58.756 --> 14:00.424
What do you want me to say, Maggie?

14:00.507 --> 14:03.218
I wait tables at a shitty tourist
restaurant in Hollywood.

14:03.302 --> 14:05.679
It's fucking boring, the end.
What do you want to know?

14:09.350 --> 14:11.435
You know, I'm tired. I'm gonna go to bed.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.395
All right, good night.

14:37.753 --> 14:38.796
Shit.

15:08.909 --> 15:12.496
The key to buddy breathing is not to panic.

15:13.330 --> 15:15.791
Don't freak out or you'll die.

15:17.334 --> 15:19.545
Don't yank the regulator
away from your partner.

15:19.628 --> 15:21.255
Don't bogart the thing either.

15:21.672 --> 15:25.634
All right, so, everybody partner up.
Let's go, let's do it.

15:31.348 --> 15:32.558
Looking for a date?

15:34.351 --> 15:35.686
A partner.

15:37.271 --> 15:39.690
Oh, yeah, sure. Okay.

16:06.717 --> 16:09.761
This is a book
that we're selling a lot more of.

16:10.721 --> 16:14.266
It's just much more practical.
It's much more hands-on.

16:14.892 --> 16:16.977
Does that sound...
It sounds perfect.

16:17.060 --> 16:19.813
Okay, good. Yeah, good luck.
Thank you.

16:23.567 --> 16:24.860
Surprise.

16:25.944 --> 16:27.321
Milo.

16:28.405 --> 16:30.157
Back from the dead.

16:31.742 --> 16:33.160
What are you doing here?

16:33.243 --> 16:35.025
I just rolled into town.
I wanted to say hi.

16:35.038 --> 16:36.830
No, what are you doing
here at the store?

16:36.914 --> 16:39.917
I am looking for the new
Danielle Steel novel.

16:43.212 --> 16:46.840
You should go.
No, hey, no, I... Let's go hiking.

16:47.716 --> 16:50.552
Let's go to Kate's Lazy Meadow
and, you know,

16:51.011 --> 16:54.515
go to the Harvest Festival and...
Milo, you're out of your mind.

16:54.765 --> 16:56.058
No, Rich, I just think...

16:56.141 --> 16:57.684
Don't come here again.

17:10.113 --> 17:12.115
When do the boys show up?

17:12.406 --> 17:14.326
It's Dyke Night, sweetie.

17:14.409 --> 17:16.703
It's what?
Dyke Night.

17:18.664 --> 17:20.290
Dyke Night?

17:22.209 --> 17:24.211
I showed up on Dyke Night?

17:24.711 --> 17:26.171
Yeah.

17:26.380 --> 17:27.839
Shit.

17:32.970 --> 17:34.221
Jesus.
Hey!

17:34.638 --> 17:38.684
Cal's Corner, fucking Dyke Night.

17:38.809 --> 17:40.894
What?
Oh, boy.

17:40.978 --> 17:42.437
Dyke Night.

17:42.521 --> 17:44.481
Milo, can we talk about
this in the morning?

17:44.565 --> 17:46.483
Sandra and Melissa were very nice.

17:46.608 --> 17:50.654
They were two lesbian ladies
who taught me how to play darts.

17:51.071 --> 17:52.711
But they were not what I was looking for.

17:52.739 --> 17:53.907
What I was looking for,

17:53.991 --> 17:56.994
and you should know this
since we're now related, Lance,

17:57.661 --> 17:59.329
I was looking for some cock.

17:59.413 --> 18:01.039
Okay, Milo, enough.

18:01.206 --> 18:03.458
You're fine 'cause
you're married to my sister.

18:03.542 --> 18:05.002
You're off-limits.
"Off limits."

18:05.085 --> 18:08.422
Just letting you know, if any of
your little buddies around, just...

18:08.505 --> 18:11.091
Milo! Go to bed.
I will be on them like steak on rice.

18:11.174 --> 18:12.259
Okay, Milo, good night.

18:12.342 --> 18:15.554
I'm just letting you know. I'm
a little tipsy. I'm sorry.

18:15.637 --> 18:17.222
That's okay.
No shit.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.311
Milo, good night.
Good night.

18:29.234 --> 18:31.820
Yeah, about last night...
You can't do stuff like that.

18:31.987 --> 18:34.906
Sorry, I was just trying to blow off
some steam, that's all. I just...

18:37.200 --> 18:41.538
So, Lance and I were talking,
and he might need some help

18:42.664 --> 18:44.875
on this trail project at the dam.

18:44.958 --> 18:46.627
Just clearing brush and stuff.

18:47.419 --> 18:49.796
A trail project at the dam?

18:50.047 --> 18:52.549
Yeah. It's what he does.

18:53.258 --> 18:54.968
What do you mean, clearing brush?
Like picking up sticks?

18:55.052 --> 18:59.848
Brush! Sticks and leaves
and pieces of bushes and stuff.

19:00.515 --> 19:02.893
It might be good for you.
So, it's like a job?

19:03.268 --> 19:06.897
It might be nice
for you to spend time with him and stuff.

19:07.522 --> 19:10.651
Be out in nature with the brush.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.153
Do I get a sexy outfit?

19:13.737 --> 19:15.530
I'll make sure of it.

19:20.327 --> 19:21.870
Here.

19:23.580 --> 19:26.333
Probably should've worn longer sleeves.

19:26.917 --> 19:30.379
Yeah, no, I mean, next time, you know?

19:30.462 --> 19:33.548
'Cause then if you have long sleeves,
you can make more of a scooping motion.

19:33.632 --> 19:37.636
You might be able to get
more with each grab, you know?

19:37.886 --> 19:39.429
Yeah, no, I get it.

19:40.097 --> 19:43.684
I'm not really an outdoorsy kind of guy.

19:43.767 --> 19:46.436
Right. Well, no worries, my man.

19:48.814 --> 19:51.358
You know, I got an extra
fleece in the truck.

19:51.441 --> 19:53.026
You want me to go...
No, no, I'm good.

19:53.110 --> 19:55.028
Thank you.
You got it?

19:56.321 --> 19:58.865
Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.

21:03.430 --> 21:05.015
You okay? You all right?

21:05.724 --> 21:07.851
Take a breath. Take a breath.

21:10.061 --> 21:11.354
What happened down there?

21:11.980 --> 21:13.190
Nothing, I'm fine.

21:13.648 --> 21:14.983
Yeah?
I'm fine.

21:15.066 --> 21:16.067
All right.

21:19.362 --> 21:20.572
Hello?

21:20.906 --> 21:22.616
Hi.
What the hell's that?

21:23.033 --> 21:24.826
Happy first day of work.

21:24.910 --> 21:26.244
You didn't have to do that.

21:27.037 --> 21:28.413
What, you don't like it?

21:28.538 --> 21:29.790
No, I love it. It's great.

21:29.873 --> 21:31.750
So, I told somebody that I was in town,

21:32.042 --> 21:36.004
and I didn't think she would come,
so don't freak out.

21:37.130 --> 21:39.132
Hi, angel.

21:39.633 --> 21:40.717
Mother.

21:40.926 --> 21:42.886
Oh, dear.

21:43.887 --> 21:46.932
Okay, broken glass. Everybody freeze.
I'm gonna go get a dustpan. You okay?

21:47.265 --> 21:48.892
Yeah.
I'm gonna go get a dustpan.

21:48.975 --> 21:49.976
Okay.

21:51.228 --> 21:54.523
So, that's Tanner?
No, that's Tad.

21:54.898 --> 21:56.358
Tanner's the oldest.

21:57.067 --> 21:58.735
They look a lot like their father.

21:59.569 --> 22:01.404
See?
I love Arches.

22:01.780 --> 22:03.657
Yeah.
The Grand Canyon's gotten so commercial.

22:03.740 --> 22:07.035
Arches has retained its essence, you know?

22:07.118 --> 22:09.579
It's just such a very,
very spiritual place.

22:09.663 --> 22:10.997
Arches is rad.

22:11.081 --> 22:14.793
I actually road-tripped it down there
spring break sophomore year.

22:15.502 --> 22:18.755
It's insane. Unbelievable.
A toast? A toast? I want to make a toast.

22:20.257 --> 22:25.303
To my beautiful, beautiful children,
and to my lovely son-in-law.

22:26.054 --> 22:30.308
May the light embrace you
with its energy infinite.

22:31.309 --> 22:35.272
May you dwell in a place
of peace and tolerance.

22:36.690 --> 22:41.403
May you live in warmth and understanding
for your days eternal.

22:41.736 --> 22:43.196
Amen.
Yeah.

22:43.613 --> 22:44.990
Cheers.
Now.

22:45.073 --> 22:46.616
Darling, thank you.

22:47.742 --> 22:49.953
So, when are you gonna
come down and visit us in Sedona?

22:50.412 --> 22:51.997
I guess whenever we're invited.

22:52.330 --> 22:54.249
Oh, my God! You just have to show up.

22:54.332 --> 22:56.543
Just drop in. We don't
like to be scheduled.

22:56.626 --> 22:58.378
Perfect.
Great, so how's next week?

22:58.628 --> 23:01.631
Next... That's not gonna
actually be the best week.

23:01.715 --> 23:04.509
Okay, great.
The week after that. We can go then.

23:06.469 --> 23:07.762
Okay, well...

23:07.846 --> 23:09.806
Hey, Mom, how are the alpacas?

23:10.432 --> 23:13.727
We had to get rid of them.
It was just too much poop.

23:13.810 --> 23:16.062
You know what they say,
everybody poops, right?

23:16.229 --> 23:18.940
When I was a kid,
I didn't think that girls pooped.

23:19.024 --> 23:21.610
Seriously.
I've never taken a shit before.

23:23.278 --> 23:24.279
Milo.

23:24.362 --> 23:26.781
So what about your insight retreats, Mom?

23:28.491 --> 23:30.785
What about them?
Do you have one coming up?

23:30.869 --> 23:31.870
Why do you ask?

23:32.454 --> 23:33.872
Oh, I just want to make
sure I don't schedule

23:33.955 --> 23:36.625
the most important event
of my life on the same day.

23:36.708 --> 23:37.834
Okay, just...

23:37.918 --> 23:40.086
You know it broke my heart
to miss the wedding.

23:40.170 --> 23:42.380
Actually, you know, I
don't know that it did.

23:43.006 --> 23:46.509
You're here now, right?
Yes, yes. Thank you.

23:46.593 --> 23:48.713
Did everybody hear
how I've never taken a shit before?

23:48.762 --> 23:49.922
Did you guys miss that?
Yeah.

23:49.930 --> 23:52.015
Why are we talking about
such unpleasant things?

23:53.016 --> 23:55.644
Milo, what's new with you, darling?

23:58.688 --> 24:00.941
I'm gonna go grab the Tabasco.

24:01.691 --> 24:03.360
Anybody like anything?

24:04.694 --> 24:06.446
Everything's great.

24:08.073 --> 24:09.950
It's good.
That's terrific.

24:11.701 --> 24:13.620
Everything is terrific.

24:15.872 --> 24:17.040
Now, breathe out.

24:18.249 --> 24:19.542
Yes.

24:21.378 --> 24:23.380
You're cleansed. Open your eyes.

24:24.130 --> 24:25.966
Oh, my God! How do you feel?

24:26.049 --> 24:29.302
Good, yeah. I might be a little drunk.

24:29.719 --> 24:31.096
You look completely different.

24:31.179 --> 24:33.181
Oh, my God! There's just... There's a...

24:33.264 --> 24:36.643
A purity
and a kind of a glow coming off you.

24:36.726 --> 24:39.562
It's emanating from your crown chakra.

24:40.939 --> 24:42.649
Lance, would you like to be cleansed?

24:42.732 --> 24:45.193
I'm okay, thank you.
I took a sauna this morning.

24:45.276 --> 24:47.779
But I feel good.
Sweetheart?

24:47.862 --> 24:49.447
Oh, I don't usually drink and cleanse.

24:49.531 --> 24:51.366
Just, like, personal policy.

24:51.783 --> 24:52.909
But thank you.

24:52.993 --> 24:55.912
Okay, I guess I should be heading back.

24:56.329 --> 24:57.747
What, like, back to Arizona?

24:57.914 --> 24:59.749
Well, it's a terrific coincidence.

25:00.166 --> 25:04.004
You know, Maggie,
you asked me about the insight retreat.

25:04.295 --> 25:05.755
Guess where it is this year?

25:06.423 --> 25:08.591
Woodstock. Around the corner.

25:08.758 --> 25:10.798
Oh, you've gotta be kidding.
I mean, it's such a...

25:11.094 --> 25:13.054
This just worked out perfectly.

25:13.263 --> 25:14.472
So that's why you came here?

25:14.556 --> 25:16.099
No, no.

25:16.182 --> 25:17.767
I came here to see you two.

25:17.851 --> 25:19.352
Oh, just shut up, Mother.

25:19.728 --> 25:21.688
Hey, Maggie.
This is classic.

25:22.689 --> 25:25.316
Classic bullshit.
Okay, Maggie...

25:25.567 --> 25:27.368
I have to compliment you, though.
I really do.

25:27.444 --> 25:28.737
You gave it a good shot.

25:28.945 --> 25:32.282
But I have to tell you,
you're really not that good of an actress.

25:32.449 --> 25:36.786
Okay. Well, as pleasant as this is...
Stop trying, Judy.

25:38.371 --> 25:40.040
Stop trying-

25:40.707 --> 25:43.918
There are worse things
than being a shitty mother.

25:46.629 --> 25:50.091
So, if you've finished

25:51.634 --> 25:53.094
vomiting all over me,

25:54.137 --> 25:55.472
I will just say

25:56.806 --> 26:01.061
thank you for dinner,
and, Milo, thank you for the invitation.

26:02.562 --> 26:05.815
I'm sorry the night ended
up being so toxic.

26:07.817 --> 26:09.235
I just want you both to know.

26:09.527 --> 26:10.862
Oh, my God!

26:12.489 --> 26:14.240
I'm sending you the light.

26:15.617 --> 26:16.910
Good night, Lance.

26:17.160 --> 26:19.704
Good night, Judy. I'll walk you out.

26:25.043 --> 26:27.837
Well, at least she's sending us the light.

27:20.223 --> 27:24.060
Are those shoes?
Yeah, kinda. They're a hybrid.

27:24.644 --> 27:25.728
Hybrid of...

27:25.895 --> 27:29.732
Of, you know, just shoes and a foot.

27:29.983 --> 27:31.526
The human foot.

27:33.611 --> 27:36.239
You know, some people
use a knife and fork for those things.

27:36.364 --> 27:40.243
Yeah? Well, I'm not most people, babe,
and I think that's why you love me.

27:40.493 --> 27:43.246
'Cause I set myself aside from the pack.

27:43.621 --> 27:45.790
Yeah.
I'll see you tonight, okay?

27:45.957 --> 27:47.250
I gotta get going-

27:47.417 --> 27:49.210
Oh, there he is.
Hey.

27:49.544 --> 27:51.171
What's up, chief?

27:52.422 --> 27:54.007
Nothing.

27:54.132 --> 27:56.217
Okay, I'll check you two dudes later.

27:56.342 --> 27:59.345
Wallet, Lance.
Where is it, baby? Where is it?

28:03.057 --> 28:04.517
Is he ever not like that?

28:05.268 --> 28:06.988
You know I'm happy that you're here, right?

28:07.103 --> 28:09.606
Here it comes.
And you can stay as long as you need.

28:09.689 --> 28:11.733
But“ What do you think?

28:12.984 --> 28:15.570
I thought she'd be different.
It doesn't matter.

28:15.653 --> 28:18.173
You had no right bringing her
into this house without asking me.

28:18.198 --> 28:19.616
Yes, Warden.

28:21.868 --> 28:25.109
Did you really think she'd be different,
that she'd actually give a shit about us?

28:25.121 --> 28:26.789
Maybe.
Please.

28:27.290 --> 28:29.918
She's been done with us ever since Dad...

28:31.044 --> 28:32.337
I don't even blame him.

28:33.463 --> 28:36.174
Imagine being married to her.
I'd probably jump off a bridge, too.

28:36.299 --> 28:37.800
Okay.

28:39.344 --> 28:41.387
I don't want this. Eat it.

28:43.181 --> 28:44.682
Okay.

28:45.892 --> 28:47.560
So, how you feel?
I'm good.

28:47.644 --> 28:49.270
Yeah?
Yeah.

28:50.230 --> 28:52.031
I'm a little embarrassed
about the other day.

28:52.649 --> 28:54.776
I was on planet Jupiter or something.

28:55.652 --> 28:57.111
Don't worry about it.

28:57.487 --> 28:58.988
I'm a doof.
No.

28:59.155 --> 29:01.241
You're one of my favorites.

29:12.835 --> 29:14.879
Someone told me to read this once.

29:20.677 --> 29:21.678
Where to, boss?

29:22.053 --> 29:24.138
I need you to tell me why you're here.
I'm...

29:24.847 --> 29:27.976
I just want to make conversation.
I just want to see how you're doing.

29:28.268 --> 29:30.853
Really?
Yeah, nothing more.

29:31.312 --> 29:33.815
I'm not gonna chop your balls off just yet.

29:36.192 --> 29:39.195
Okay, 'cause I really
wasn't expecting to see you anytime soon.

29:39.279 --> 29:41.281
I'm sure.
This is weird.

29:41.364 --> 29:43.491
I know. I know it's weird.

29:50.456 --> 29:54.627
So, how are... What are you... How are you?

29:54.711 --> 29:57.797
I'm good. Yeah, I'm good.
I have a girlfriend.

30:00.383 --> 30:02.760
Melinda. She's great. She's an optometrist.

30:02.844 --> 30:04.345
Oh, cool.

30:04.429 --> 30:09.392
Really good for me.
She gets along with Eric really well.

30:09.767 --> 30:11.686
Eric:?
My son.

30:12.353 --> 30:14.314
Right, your son.

30:18.276 --> 30:19.736
Are you living here now?

30:19.902 --> 30:21.738
No, no, I...

30:22.113 --> 30:24.657
Temporarily. I'm just here for...
I live in L.A.

30:24.741 --> 30:26.909
L.A., that's cool. Yeah, yeah.

30:26.993 --> 30:29.329
How's that?
Good, good. It's going really well.

30:29.412 --> 30:30.663
I mean, the key is just staying busy,
you know?

30:30.747 --> 30:37.086
I've just been acting and auditioning
and I just got this agent.

30:37.503 --> 30:38.864
Really?
Yeah, I have an agent now.

30:38.921 --> 30:42.342
An agent. Wow, that's impressive.
Yeah.

30:46.304 --> 30:49.344
What brings you to town other than scaring
the shit out of me at a bookstore?

30:49.640 --> 30:51.601
Yeah, that was my sole purpose.

30:51.684 --> 30:55.229
No, I... There's a writer's retreat.

30:55.897 --> 30:57.690
You know, I'm writing this one-man show.

30:57.982 --> 31:02.070
Well, it doesn't surprise me at all.
You were always a great writer.

31:02.236 --> 31:04.864
Oh, well, I had a...

31:05.615 --> 31:07.116
I had a good teacher.

31:10.661 --> 31:14.207
It's a little cove off the Pawai Bay
on the Kona Coast, off the Big Island.

31:14.791 --> 31:16.876
My mate Mike has been there since '05

31:16.959 --> 31:19.003
taking small groups diving,
and I'm telling you...

31:19.670 --> 31:21.339
Pretty?
It's stunning.

31:21.422 --> 31:24.092
Sea turtles, manta rays, blue sharks.

31:24.175 --> 31:26.177
That sounds incredible.

31:26.511 --> 31:28.137
Except for the sharks, I guess.

31:28.471 --> 31:30.139
They're harmless.

31:30.973 --> 31:32.308
Besides,

31:33.768 --> 31:36.312
you could handle a little old shark.

31:48.533 --> 31:50.076
You want another?
Yeah.

31:50.201 --> 31:51.619
No. No.

31:52.787 --> 31:54.997
I think I've filled my quota.

31:55.998 --> 31:57.250
I should go.

31:57.333 --> 32:00.545
I haven't finished my drink yet.
Here, I'll take that.

32:03.923 --> 32:05.883
Okay, there we go.

32:06.217 --> 32:07.260
That was fun.

32:07.385 --> 32:10.513
We had drinks. That was nice. Thank you.

32:11.389 --> 32:13.391
I will see you in class.

32:17.311 --> 32:18.521
Shit.

32:45.965 --> 32:47.216
Sweetie?

32:48.759 --> 32:49.927
Yeah?

32:50.011 --> 32:52.138
Are we out of pizza pockets?

32:54.974 --> 32:58.561
I think so.
Well, can you put them on the list, please?

33:03.441 --> 33:04.650
Honey?

33:15.119 --> 33:16.440
So, you'll pick me up after work?

33:16.579 --> 33:17.955
Okay.

33:21.626 --> 33:23.794
All right, well, have a good day at work.
I will.

33:23.878 --> 33:26.088
Tell Lance I say hi.
I will.

33:27.548 --> 33:28.799
Okay. All right.

33:28.883 --> 33:30.676
Bye, have a good day.
See ya, bye.

33:30.760 --> 33:32.178
Bye.

33:37.517 --> 33:38.643
What's up?

33:40.436 --> 33:41.938
Do you think I should have a baby?

33:42.021 --> 33:45.816
I mean, do you think
I would be a good mom?

33:50.780 --> 33:52.281
I don't know.

33:55.451 --> 33:58.621
I mean, I think you'd be very attentive.

33:59.580 --> 34:03.000
Okay.
And maybe a bit overprotective.

34:04.752 --> 34:05.795
Uptight.

34:05.920 --> 34:07.046
Gee, thanks.

34:07.129 --> 34:08.965
No, I'm just being honest, I'm...

34:09.047 --> 34:10.800
It's a loaded question. I'm sorry.

34:11.132 --> 34:12.885
I think I'd be an excellent mom.

34:13.261 --> 34:14.554
Okay.

34:16.514 --> 34:17.806
What do you want me to say?

34:18.474 --> 34:21.114
How about something that doesn't
make me feel like a piece of shit?

34:22.978 --> 34:25.731
You know, you're so goddamn selfish, Milo,
it's mind-blowing.

34:25.815 --> 34:27.024
Maggie.

34:28.775 --> 34:31.279
Oh, that's classic Maggie, man. Classic.

34:31.362 --> 34:32.905
Yeah, she just jumped down my throat.

34:32.989 --> 34:34.364
It was crazy. Land mines, man.

34:35.616 --> 34:37.702
It's like sometimes she and I will
be strolling through the park

34:37.909 --> 34:41.746
laughing, getting along perfect,
and then, kaboom, you know?

34:41.956 --> 34:44.500
A freakin' land mine blows my nuts off.

34:45.333 --> 34:46.335
You know?
Yeah.

34:46.418 --> 34:49.338
And I'll think, "Oh, I could've sworn
my nuts were there a minute ago."

34:50.422 --> 34:51.632
"I wonder where they went."

34:51.716 --> 34:53.676
No nuts.
Oh, there they are.

34:53.926 --> 34:55.636
They got blown clear across the room.

34:55.719 --> 34:58.472
They're sliding down that wall over there.
My nuts.

34:58.848 --> 35:00.725
And then, you know, when I think about it,

35:01.434 --> 35:04.645
it was probably my fault in the first
place, so I'll just apologize to her.

35:05.271 --> 35:08.858
I probably said
something stupid or insensitive,

35:09.692 --> 35:13.404
so I'll just tell her that I was sorry,
and then it's fine.

35:17.450 --> 35:19.201
Land mines, dude.

35:22.997 --> 35:23.998
There she is.

35:24.624 --> 35:26.542
Your chariot awaits.

35:31.631 --> 35:33.424
All right, look, I'm sorry.

35:33.758 --> 35:35.301
I'm an idiot.

35:35.384 --> 35:36.594
So what else is new?

35:36.927 --> 35:39.430
You'd make an amazing mother, okay?

35:40.348 --> 35:42.558
I thought I was too uptight.

35:42.808 --> 35:45.487
I just said that so I
didn't have to talk about

35:45.500 --> 35:48.189
the real issue, which
is your morbid obesity.

35:49.440 --> 35:52.068
I'm surprised you can even leave the house.

35:56.656 --> 35:58.407
When was the last time
you had your teeth cleaned?

35:58.574 --> 36:00.326
No. No, no, no, no, no.
Come on.

36:00.409 --> 36:03.037
No.
Hey, I am a licensed dental hygienist.

36:03.120 --> 36:04.372
Don't you want to see me work?

36:04.455 --> 36:05.581
No.

36:13.255 --> 36:17.718
There are so many planets,
yet so little time.

36:17.802 --> 36:19.282
All right, okay, I'm gonna take this.

36:19.345 --> 36:21.472
Wait, what are you doing?
Milo, that's enough.

36:21.555 --> 36:24.075
Wait, wait, wait. I'm not done yet.
Come on, seriously, let go.

36:24.100 --> 36:25.434
Let go.

36:25.518 --> 36:27.019
I'm not done.
Stop.

36:29.939 --> 36:32.483
Okay, okay, are you ready?
I'm sorry. Okay.

36:32.566 --> 36:34.985
'Cause this is serious stuff here.

36:45.204 --> 36:46.956
A few more seconds.

36:51.293 --> 36:52.962
Give that to me! Give it to me.

36:53.212 --> 36:55.631
Spit. Spit in there.

36:56.882 --> 36:58.483
Sorry, I think this is broken.
Oh, my...

36:59.135 --> 37:01.137
Milo, stop.

37:01.470 --> 37:04.974
That thing, you gotta have
that thing fixed. My God!

37:05.057 --> 37:08.018
You know what?
You need to take the edge off.

37:09.687 --> 37:11.188
Yeah, right. No.

37:12.273 --> 37:15.943
Everybody's doing it. If you don't do it,
no one will ever talk to you.

37:16.026 --> 37:17.278
I'm not doing it.

37:17.361 --> 37:22.241
Ross is doing it, Tina's doing it,
Emily's doing it, Casey's doing it.

37:22.324 --> 37:23.951
Shannon is doing it.
Shannon cannot be doing it.

37:24.034 --> 37:28.330
Eric T. And Eric S.
Eric T. And Eric S., too?

37:28.414 --> 37:31.167
Eric S. And Eric T. Are both doing it.

37:32.835 --> 37:33.961
I'm not doing it.

37:34.295 --> 37:36.797
I have a very serious question for you.

37:37.840 --> 37:39.967
Will you go to prom with me?

37:45.473 --> 37:47.099
I think you're gassy.

38:03.991 --> 38:06.410
It's okay, this won't hurt. Ready?

38:10.206 --> 38:13.375
That hurt?
Your elbow went into my arm muscle.

38:13.459 --> 38:15.002
"Your elbow went into
my arm muscle, mister."

38:15.085 --> 38:17.713
"Your elbow went
into my arm muscle, mister."

38:17.797 --> 38:20.549
"Oh, my paper route's gonna be screwed."

38:29.391 --> 38:31.185
I'm getting out of here.

38:48.410 --> 38:50.663
That was a good joke.
Thanks.

38:51.163 --> 38:53.499
I have to tell you something, Maggie.
What?

38:53.582 --> 38:55.334
Last month in L.A...

38:58.295 --> 39:00.256
What? What?

39:01.215 --> 39:02.883
I ate pussy.

39:02.967 --> 39:04.260
What?

39:06.595 --> 39:08.514
What?
I know, I'm not proud of it.

39:08.597 --> 39:11.267
Why? HOW? Why? Who?

39:11.767 --> 39:13.936
She looked like a young Debbie Harry.

39:14.019 --> 39:17.481
I was drunk and curious.
I just couldn't resist.

39:18.440 --> 39:20.109
Oh, my gosh.

39:21.110 --> 39:23.487
Well, what... How... Verdict?

39:23.946 --> 39:27.032
I was a little out to sea.
I'll tell you that.

39:28.492 --> 39:32.371
Out in a wet, stormy,

39:33.205 --> 39:34.957
pungent sea.

39:40.379 --> 39:43.048
All right, now your turn.
My turn?

39:43.299 --> 39:46.510
I told you a secret.
You have to tell me a secret.

39:48.971 --> 39:51.473
I don't have any secrets.
Maggie.

39:52.725 --> 39:54.476
Maggie Dean.

39:58.898 --> 40:00.691
I'm on birth control.

40:01.817 --> 40:03.235
Really?

40:04.445 --> 40:05.863
Yeah.

40:06.447 --> 40:09.158
I hide it in a basket in the bathroom.

40:09.992 --> 40:14.663
I figure Lance won't be looking for
butterfly decorative soaps anytime soon.

40:16.373 --> 40:19.126
So, it's terrible.

40:21.337 --> 40:25.674
Wouldn't it be easier just to tell Lance
you're not ready to have a kid?

40:25.758 --> 40:26.842
Yeah.

40:27.593 --> 40:29.595
It would be a lot easier.

40:31.138 --> 40:35.392
But there's a little more to it than that.

40:35.726 --> 40:37.186
What?

40:40.648 --> 40:42.650
It's really bad.
What?

40:44.276 --> 40:45.861
I slept with my scuba instructor.

40:46.070 --> 40:47.363
Maggie.

40:47.529 --> 40:49.198
I know, it sounds like a porno.

40:49.365 --> 40:50.783
Just once?

40:53.369 --> 40:55.037
With him? "With him"?

40:55.371 --> 40:58.290
Yeah. I took a French cooking class
like six months ago.

40:58.374 --> 40:59.708
Maggie!

41:00.209 --> 41:04.672
And a nature photography course...
I met this guy.

41:05.130 --> 41:07.299
It's a fetish is what it sounds like.

41:08.884 --> 41:11.971
If Lance finds out, it will destroy him

41:12.471 --> 41:15.391
and I will not be able to live with myself.

41:20.562 --> 41:22.398
Please say something.

41:23.148 --> 41:25.401
I guess Lance just doesn't do it for you.

41:25.567 --> 41:27.695
But why? He's so great.

41:28.320 --> 41:34.410
He's so sweet and cute and nice
and he would make such a great dad,

41:34.868 --> 41:39.289
and he is the polar opposite of all
the assholes that I'm used to dating.

41:41.875 --> 41:45.087
He doesn't deserve
a fucking whore as a wife.

41:45.170 --> 41:46.463
You're not a whore. Oh, really?

41:46.547 --> 41:48.340
So don't say that, please.
What would you call it, then?

41:48.424 --> 41:52.344
You're a restless housewife
with whore-like tendencies.

41:53.262 --> 41:54.638
Shut up.

41:55.222 --> 41:56.557
It doesn't help.

41:58.183 --> 41:59.518
Do you love him?

42:00.519 --> 42:02.938
Yeah, I do. He's...

42:05.107 --> 42:06.483
He's good.

42:06.775 --> 42:08.902
Maybe good isn't your thing.

42:10.279 --> 42:11.655
Maybe.

42:14.533 --> 42:16.118
What am I gonna do?

42:16.869 --> 42:19.110
You're gonna do a bunch of nitrous
with your gay brother?

42:21.957 --> 42:23.751
You wanna talk about this more downstairs?

42:23.834 --> 42:24.835
Sure.

42:28.547 --> 42:30.591
Oh, this hurts my back.
Me, too, my spine.

42:30.674 --> 42:33.260
Why did I say, "Let's talk downstairs"?
I don't know.

42:37.222 --> 42:39.808
Wait, what time is it?
I don't know.

42:40.267 --> 42:41.727
Shit.

42:42.728 --> 42:44.855
What?
Come on, we gotta go.

42:44.938 --> 42:47.107
Why?
I have a meeting.

42:47.191 --> 42:48.567
You have a meeting? With who?

42:48.650 --> 42:52.821
With Kevin Clancy from high school.

42:53.197 --> 42:54.823
Really?
Yeah.

42:55.157 --> 42:56.742
Cool. Can I come?

42:58.744 --> 43:03.457
No. I think he wanted to make it
kind of like a one-on-one kind of meeting.

43:04.041 --> 43:05.918
Is that weird? I'm sorry.
No.

43:06.001 --> 43:07.122
No, it's fine.
Ls that cool?

43:07.127 --> 43:08.462
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
All right, we gotta go, though.

43:08.545 --> 43:09.755
We gotta go.

43:11.006 --> 43:12.674
Oh, my God! You're killing me.

43:12.758 --> 43:14.927
No, no, no, but, listen, it's like,
"Melville, dude, please,"

43:15.010 --> 43:18.263
"just write me a story about a whale,
a guy who catches a whale."

43:18.347 --> 43:22.101
"Why does it have to be 800 pages
of the history of whaling"

43:22.184 --> 43:24.603
"and all this existential crisis bullshit?"

43:24.686 --> 43:30.692
Like, who gives a shit when the writing
is that weird and funny and rich and alive

43:30.776 --> 43:31.944
and did I mention weird?

43:32.319 --> 43:33.612
You know what I mean, though?
But with class.

43:33.695 --> 43:35.280
And pretentious. And pretentious.

43:35.614 --> 43:40.202
There's a great Moby Dick illustrated
that I think you'd love.

43:40.369 --> 43:43.372
There's a pop-up whale at the end.
Fuck you.

43:45.999 --> 43:47.876
Didn't I give you a whale?

43:47.960 --> 43:50.889
I feel like I gave you,
like, a copper figurine

43:50.902 --> 43:53.841
for your birthday
that I got at that...

43:55.801 --> 43:58.512
Wow! You carry that with you?

43:59.138 --> 44:03.016
I don't know. It's, like, a little
good luck charm or something.

44:04.059 --> 44:06.311
Well, it's working.

44:07.521 --> 44:09.314
Is it? I don't know if it is.
Yeah.

44:09.398 --> 44:11.275
Yeah, Mr. Fancy L.A. Agent.

44:12.067 --> 44:14.319
I should've kept that whale for myself.

44:14.403 --> 44:16.321
It's not that big of a deal.
He's not that big of an agent.

44:16.405 --> 44:18.365
I think it's incredible.

44:21.493 --> 44:25.038
I always knew you'd
do something amazing with your life.

44:27.249 --> 44:29.251
I'm proud of you, Milo.

44:32.337 --> 44:33.630
Do you wanna get out of here?

44:40.637 --> 44:43.599
Those lobster cages can
knock you right off.

44:44.057 --> 44:45.017
What?

44:45.100 --> 44:47.352
Well, actually, they're
called lobster pots,

44:47.436 --> 44:49.813
but they can knock these guys
right off the deck.

44:49.897 --> 44:51.773
They're real dangerous.

44:53.859 --> 44:55.277
I think those are crabs.

44:55.444 --> 44:58.113
Where?
Everywhere.

44:58.238 --> 45:01.033
Oh, yeah, maybe they are.

45:01.783 --> 45:02.951
No, they are.

45:04.703 --> 45:06.496
So, how's Milo working out?

45:06.580 --> 45:11.418
Good. He's definitely doing his best,
but he's been... He's trying.

45:11.793 --> 45:13.003
Good.

45:19.927 --> 45:21.345
I love you.

45:21.929 --> 45:23.555
I love you, too.

45:23.764 --> 45:25.432
I really love you.

45:26.808 --> 45:28.268
Thank you.

45:46.161 --> 45:48.038
God, I can't believe he's 16.

45:50.499 --> 45:53.460
It's strange, man. Having a kid that old.

45:54.461 --> 45:56.088
He just got his license.

45:56.171 --> 45:58.340
I'm like, "Really?"

45:58.966 --> 46:00.968
"I'm old enough to have
a kid who can drive?"

46:01.969 --> 46:03.470
My God!

46:04.680 --> 46:08.016
Does he know about me and you?

46:08.475 --> 46:10.018
No, no, God, no.

46:11.812 --> 46:13.146
He knows I used to teach

46:13.230 --> 46:17.484
and sometimes he asks why I stopped,
you know, but...

46:17.859 --> 46:19.695
What do you tell him?

46:20.362 --> 46:22.364
That it wasn't my thing.

46:24.116 --> 46:27.953
I'm sorry, Rich.
No, Milo, you don't ever have to apologize.

46:28.412 --> 46:31.498
You didn't do anything wrong.
You understand me?

46:35.252 --> 46:36.378
Okay.

46:42.259 --> 46:46.805
Look, I know what happened
was weird and illegal and shit,

46:46.888 --> 46:50.058
but it really meant something to me.

46:52.894 --> 46:54.688
And we're adults.

46:55.522 --> 46:57.274
Well, I'm an adult.

47:00.569 --> 47:04.156
God, I feel like the freshman
asking the senior to the dance.

47:04.906 --> 47:07.743
That's part of the problem. There's...

47:07.826 --> 47:12.664
There's a freshman/senior dynamic
between us.

47:14.750 --> 47:16.710
There doesn't have to be.

47:20.088 --> 47:22.674
Milo, get up. Lance is
leaving in 10 minutes.

47:24.343 --> 47:25.844
Milo?

47:33.935 --> 47:35.729
Milo, is that your phone?

47:35.812 --> 47:38.398
Oh, shit, what time is it?

47:39.191 --> 47:40.233
It's after 9:00.

47:40.317 --> 47:42.903
Fuck, I'm late for work.

47:42.986 --> 47:44.613
You and me both.

47:46.823 --> 47:48.950
So, here.

47:52.162 --> 47:55.499
"Sunrise in Manhattan."
It's a romantic comedy.

47:55.582 --> 47:59.378
About what, Balzac and Foucault?
No, it's actually pretty straightforward.

47:59.461 --> 48:03.715
I wrote it for, you know,
like, Jennifer Aniston or Kate Hudson.

48:03.799 --> 48:05.842
And I don't want to be presumptuous,

48:05.926 --> 48:07.719
but I thought, you know,
if you wanted to read it

48:07.803 --> 48:11.807
and maybe if you liked it,
you could pass it along to your agent?

48:12.724 --> 48:14.434
Yeah, okay. Yeah, totally.

48:14.518 --> 48:16.311
Yeah, I could totally... Cool.

48:16.395 --> 48:18.063
Pass it on if... I'll read it.

48:18.146 --> 48:19.523
Cool.
Yeah.

48:20.190 --> 48:22.609
I kind of... I need you to leave.

48:22.692 --> 48:24.403
Okay. Yeah, sure.

48:25.404 --> 48:27.406
Last night was fun.
Yeah.

48:27.739 --> 48:30.409
Kind of a blast from the past.

48:32.160 --> 48:34.371
Yeah, make sure the door locks
when you close it.

48:43.088 --> 48:45.424
Greetings, Ms. Dean.

48:45.507 --> 48:47.008
What brings you around these parts?

48:48.385 --> 48:49.719
It was a mistake.

48:51.805 --> 48:52.848
All right.

48:53.140 --> 48:55.183
I mean it, the whole thing.

48:55.684 --> 48:57.018
Fine.

48:57.853 --> 48:58.895
Is that all?

48:59.354 --> 49:01.481
Yeah. Yeah, that's all.

49:10.073 --> 49:11.867
What are you doing?

49:11.992 --> 49:14.119
No, Billy, I'm serious.

49:20.709 --> 49:22.085
No.

49:30.385 --> 49:34.389
Bullshit! Bullshit! Bullshit! Bullshit.

49:35.140 --> 49:36.141
Bullshit.

49:36.224 --> 49:38.351
Bull shit.

49:42.689 --> 49:44.024
Hello.

49:44.733 --> 49:45.901
Where were you this morning?

49:46.902 --> 49:52.824
Well, Kevin had a friend,
and last night, I got lucky.

49:53.074 --> 49:55.368
Well, you missed work, so, not cool.

49:55.827 --> 49:57.662
I was a little late. Lance understood.

49:57.746 --> 49:59.664
You have to get your shit together, Milo.

49:59.789 --> 50:02.000
That is a very interesting
statement coming from you.

50:02.083 --> 50:03.752
You know what?
What?

50:15.138 --> 50:16.264
Wow.

50:26.274 --> 50:27.359
What are you doing?

50:30.195 --> 50:31.279
Milo.

50:53.343 --> 50:57.764
Looking in your eyes
I see a paradise.

50:57.847 --> 51:02.769
This world that I found
is too good to be true.

51:03.186 --> 51:07.899
Standing here beside you,
want so much to give you.

51:07.983 --> 51:12.821
This love in my heart
that I'm feeling for you.

51:13.863 --> 51:16.199
Let 'em say we're crazy

51:16.283 --> 51:18.493
I don't care about that.

51:18.702 --> 51:20.912
Put your hand in my hand, baby.

51:20.996 --> 51:23.373
Don't ever look back.

51:23.707 --> 51:28.086
Let the world around us
just fall apart.

51:28.670 --> 51:32.841
Baby, we can make it
if we're heart to heart.

51:34.009 --> 51:37.637
And we can build
this dream together.

51:37.721 --> 51:40.390
Standing strong forever.

51:40.473 --> 51:43.935
Nothing's gonna stop us now.

51:44.227 --> 51:47.772
And if this world
runs out of lovers.

51:47.856 --> 51:50.317
We'll still have each other.

51:50.400 --> 51:52.485
Nothing's gonna stop us.

51:52.569 --> 51:56.656
Nothing's gonna stop us now.

51:59.034 --> 52:00.201
Okay, I got it.

52:00.368 --> 52:02.495
I'm so glad I found you

52:02.579 --> 52:05.123
I'm not gonna lose you.

52:05.206 --> 52:09.377
Whatever it takes,
I will stay here with you.

52:10.253 --> 52:15.216
Take it to the good times,
see it through the bad times.

52:15.300 --> 52:20.013
Whatever it takes
is what I'm gonna do.

52:20.805 --> 52:23.224
Let 'em say we 're crazy.

52:23.308 --> 52:25.226
What do they know?

52:25.727 --> 52:30.231
Put your arms around me,
baby, don't ever let go.

52:30.607 --> 52:34.903
Let the world around us
just fall apart.

52:35.612 --> 52:39.783
Baby, we can make it
if we're heart to heart.

52:40.950 --> 52:44.788
And we can build
this dream together.

52:44.871 --> 52:47.415
Standing strong forever.

52:47.499 --> 52:50.835
Nothing's gonna stop us now.

52:51.252 --> 52:54.756
And if this world
runs out of lovers.

52:54.881 --> 52:57.342
We'll still have each other.

52:57.425 --> 53:02.472
Nothing's gonna stop us,
nothing's gonna stop us.

53:02.555 --> 53:08.269
Ooh, all that I need is you.

53:09.813 --> 53:13.441
All that I ever need.

53:14.901 --> 53:18.279
All that I want to do

53:19.823 --> 53:22.659
Is hold you forever.

53:22.742 --> 53:24.744
Ever and ever.

53:45.724 --> 53:49.185
And we can build
this dream together.

53:49.561 --> 53:51.646
Standing strong forever...

53:51.730 --> 53:52.772
Hi.

53:54.357 --> 53:55.650
Hi.

53:56.651 --> 53:57.944
Is your dad home?

53:58.027 --> 53:59.487
Yeah, hold on.

54:00.071 --> 54:02.657
Dad, some guy's at the door for you.

54:06.369 --> 54:07.454
I'm sorry, I thought you had him...

54:07.537 --> 54:09.080
What are you doing? You can't be here.

54:09.164 --> 54:10.498
That's my kid in there.

54:10.749 --> 54:11.916
Okay, I thought
you only had him on the weekends.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.169
I have a life, Milo. A whole life.

54:26.681 --> 54:28.516
Give me a shot of Cuervo, please.

54:35.064 --> 54:36.775
Can I have another one, please?

55:50.974 --> 55:52.267
Hey.

55:53.601 --> 55:54.978
What are you doing up here?

55:56.729 --> 55:58.940
I'm waiting for you, Mr. Big Officer Man.

55:59.983 --> 56:01.442
The fuck you say?

56:02.110 --> 56:03.695
Thank you. Thank you very much.

56:03.778 --> 56:05.154
No problem. Take care, now.

56:05.238 --> 56:06.739
Thanks.

56:11.661 --> 56:12.871
Maggie, don't freak out.

56:12.954 --> 56:14.122
What is going on?

56:14.539 --> 56:15.707
You wouldn't understand.

56:15.999 --> 56:18.626
Try me. You might be surprised.

56:19.752 --> 56:23.840
I get depressed about my life
and I do stupid things. That's it.

56:24.382 --> 56:26.217
We all get sad about our lives, Milo.

56:26.301 --> 56:28.052
That doesn't mean we go
jumping off of rooftops.

56:28.136 --> 56:29.304
I wasn't gonna jump.

56:29.429 --> 56:30.669
Okay, well, how do I know that?

56:30.847 --> 56:32.473
Okay, I'm sorry.

56:36.144 --> 56:40.607
I can't take this, Milo.
I can't right now. I can't.

56:40.899 --> 56:41.983
Hey, I'm sorry.

56:47.405 --> 56:49.699
Do you remember
Justin Meyer in eighth grade?

56:49.824 --> 56:53.119
Jock, asshole, he used to
fuck with me all the time?

56:53.202 --> 56:57.206
Dad, he told me... He
said, "Guys like Justin",

56:58.166 --> 57:01.210
"like, high school is the best
it's ever gonna get for them."

57:02.003 --> 57:03.713
"They're gonna peak in high school,"

57:03.796 --> 57:08.134
"and the rest of their life
is just gonna be a disappointment."

57:08.968 --> 57:10.595
And that kids like me,

57:12.180 --> 57:15.016
that I would soar after high school.

57:17.310 --> 57:18.478
And, in fact, I would sit there,

57:18.561 --> 57:20.813
I would fast-forward 10
years into the future

57:20.897 --> 57:24.567
and I would think
about our high school reunion

57:24.651 --> 57:31.115
and seeing Justin,
and he would just be this fat, balding guy

57:31.199 --> 57:34.953
who, you know, is the assistant
manager at some sporting goods store,

57:37.580 --> 57:40.708
and I would be this famous actor

57:40.959 --> 57:44.963
who lives in L.A. or New York
and I have this beautiful boyfriend.

57:46.798 --> 57:48.299
And I'm happy-

57:51.427 --> 57:54.514
Do you know I looked Justin up online?

57:56.391 --> 57:58.393
And do you know what he's doing now?

57:59.560 --> 58:01.062
He's an electrician,

58:02.772 --> 58:07.610
and he has two beautiful daughters
and a pretty wife.

58:09.988 --> 58:11.864
And he's happy-

58:15.243 --> 58:16.995
And it turns out that...

58:20.790 --> 58:24.669
It just turns out that I'm the one
that peaked in high school.

58:29.924 --> 58:32.844
You know, if that's not depressing, then...

58:34.512 --> 58:36.472
So, that's it, sweetie?

58:37.015 --> 58:39.267
You're not a famous actor?

58:39.934 --> 58:43.104
'Cause I got news for you.
No one's a famous actor.

58:43.354 --> 58:44.731
George Clooney's a famous actor.

58:44.939 --> 58:48.276
Okay, George Clooney,
I guess that's one exception.

58:49.777 --> 58:52.780
But the rest of us are just walking around

58:53.489 --> 58:55.283
trying not to be disappointed

58:55.908 --> 58:58.619
with the way that our lives turned out.

59:02.248 --> 59:04.917
And either we find a way to deal or...

59:09.380 --> 59:13.468
I need to know
you're not gonna check out on me.

59:16.554 --> 59:18.264
I'll do my best.

59:35.531 --> 59:37.075
What?

59:46.834 --> 59:47.835
What are you doing?

59:48.336 --> 59:50.421
It's gotta be in here somewhere.

59:52.882 --> 59:55.384
Oh, my God!

59:58.846 --> 59:59.847
Wow!

01:00:00.264 --> 01:00:02.183
Oh, here it is! I found it!

01:00:02.642 --> 01:00:04.644
Oh, my God! You still have that thing?

01:00:05.728 --> 01:00:07.688
We're going out.
What?

01:00:07.772 --> 01:00:10.441
It is Halloween, Lance
is at fantasy football,

01:00:10.525 --> 01:00:13.402
I say you put on
something pretty and/or freaky.

01:00:13.611 --> 01:00:14.862
Preferably both.

01:00:14.946 --> 01:00:16.239
Yeah.

01:00:16.781 --> 01:00:18.533
I can do this better myself.

01:00:18.658 --> 01:00:20.034
No, I wanna do it.

01:00:22.829 --> 01:00:24.205
Okay.

01:00:39.762 --> 01:00:40.763
Tell me if you don't like it.

01:00:40.847 --> 01:00:43.182
I will tell you immediately
if I don't like it.

01:00:46.561 --> 01:00:47.645
Is that a good scream?

01:00:47.728 --> 01:00:49.147
That was a great scream. I love it.

01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:51.315
Oh, my God! I can't believe it still fits.

01:00:51.399 --> 01:00:53.067
I know.
Look at me.

01:00:53.526 --> 01:00:55.153
You have better legs than I do, by the way.

01:00:55.236 --> 01:00:56.362
I have a body like a frog.

01:00:56.445 --> 01:00:57.697
No, you don't.
Yes, I do.

01:00:57.780 --> 01:00:58.990
What does that mean?

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:01.033
Just a big belly
and long arms and long legs.

01:01:01.117 --> 01:01:02.285
Just like.

01:01:13.796 --> 01:01:15.590
Oh, Michelle Waller.

01:01:15.673 --> 01:01:17.341
Pregnant again, baby number three.

01:01:17.425 --> 01:01:19.051
Baby number three?
Yeah.

01:01:19.135 --> 01:01:21.345
Shit, I didn't even know she was married.
Yeah.

01:01:22.763 --> 01:01:25.725
We haven't done
the cemetery walk since Dad died.

01:01:25.808 --> 01:01:27.185
I know.

01:01:27.268 --> 01:01:28.644
Oh, my God, watch your step.

01:01:29.061 --> 01:01:31.647
God, it has not changed a bit.

01:01:31.731 --> 01:01:33.608
I had my first wine cooler here.

01:01:33.733 --> 01:01:35.860
With who?
Jenny Copeland.

01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:39.071
That makes sense.
Yeah.

01:01:42.325 --> 01:01:43.826
Oh, wow!

01:01:48.664 --> 01:01:50.458
Dad loved Halloween.

01:01:50.958 --> 01:01:52.084
Who can blame him?

01:01:59.425 --> 01:02:00.801
Scram.

01:02:01.469 --> 01:02:03.095
Get outta here.

01:02:04.138 --> 01:02:05.181
What, are you deaf?

01:02:05.264 --> 01:02:07.975
I'm not deaf. It's Halloween, assholes.

01:02:10.686 --> 01:02:12.480
Fucking people.

01:02:18.444 --> 01:02:19.528
Oh, my God!

01:02:19.612 --> 01:02:21.989
Wait, what was the name of the...

01:02:23.157 --> 01:02:26.369
adolescent psychiatrist
that they assigned us?

01:02:26.452 --> 01:02:28.246
What was her name?
Oh, shit.

01:02:28.496 --> 01:02:30.748
Mary?
Mamie Mortimer.

01:02:30.831 --> 01:02:33.834
Mamie Mortimer.
Mamie Mortimer and her fucking journals.

01:02:33.918 --> 01:02:35.503
Giant sweaters.

01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:37.505
What was with those sweaters?

01:02:37.672 --> 01:02:39.840
Huge! She's not a big woman.

01:02:39.924 --> 01:02:42.760
Every day was Christmas
for Mamie Mortimer.

01:02:42.843 --> 01:02:45.513
Oh, my God!
"Did you write that in your journal?"

01:02:45.596 --> 01:02:47.765
"There's nothing that can't
be solved by journaling."

01:02:47.848 --> 01:02:49.934
"Oh, your dad died? Put it in a journal.

01:02:50.017 --> 01:02:52.658
"You forgot about it, didn't ya?"
"My dad died, I feel better."

01:02:52.853 --> 01:02:54.063
She had a tough gig, though.

01:02:54.146 --> 01:02:55.856
I mean, we were not good kids.

01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:58.526
I mean, what do you do
to two kids whose dad...

01:02:58.901 --> 01:03:01.102
You make them keep a journal.
Yeah, I mean, we were 14.

01:03:01.487 --> 01:03:04.115
God, we were ungrateful
bastards, though. Right?

01:03:04.532 --> 01:03:06.325
Speak for yourself.

01:03:06.742 --> 01:03:08.327
I was an angel.
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:03:08.411 --> 01:03:09.620
Maggie.

01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:11.622
"Maggie."
Maggie.

01:03:12.206 --> 01:03:14.125
Let me... Oh, wait. Let me see it.

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:15.751
What?

01:03:17.795 --> 01:03:19.213
I want to see it.

01:03:19.463 --> 01:03:20.715
Oh, what is that, a new place?

01:03:20.798 --> 01:03:22.049
No, it's always been here.

01:03:22.174 --> 01:03:25.845
Oh, there she is, dancing away.

01:03:27.346 --> 01:03:28.973
Of course she is.

01:03:29.181 --> 01:03:30.391
Did you think I got rid of it?

01:03:30.474 --> 01:03:32.977
I don't know. You're a tricky bird, Magpie.

01:03:43.738 --> 01:03:46.407
How'd we go 10 years without talking?

01:03:46.907 --> 01:03:49.702
Oh, it's probably not
worth talking about now.

01:03:50.077 --> 01:03:51.537
Probably not.

01:04:08.054 --> 01:04:09.638
Let me take my hat off.

01:04:09.722 --> 01:04:11.474
Come on.
Be polite.

01:05:29.927 --> 01:05:31.554
Magpie.

01:05:33.097 --> 01:05:36.851
Oh, peeing in a dress at a urinal
is actually not that hard.

01:05:38.185 --> 01:05:39.186
I'm gonna go.

01:05:39.728 --> 01:05:40.938
Do you want another round?

01:05:41.021 --> 01:05:42.398
I'm gonna go.

01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:44.483
Hey, hey.

01:05:45.192 --> 01:05:46.986
Wait up, Maggie.

01:05:47.069 --> 01:05:48.487
Hey, what's going on?

01:05:50.114 --> 01:05:51.574
Kevin Clancy?

01:05:52.199 --> 01:05:54.243
Kevin Clancy moved to Miami six years ago.

01:05:55.453 --> 01:05:57.246
He was in town for the weekend.

01:06:00.207 --> 01:06:02.001
What? What is this?

01:06:02.209 --> 01:06:03.586
I saw your cell phone.

01:06:04.336 --> 01:06:06.422
You have a missed call from Rich Levitt.

01:06:10.217 --> 01:06:12.052
Are you sleeping with him?

01:06:13.888 --> 01:06:17.183
Some of us have our secrets
and some of us have our reasons, Maggie.

01:06:17.266 --> 01:06:18.726
Wow.

01:06:19.185 --> 01:06:21.854
So, what, you're still
attracted to child molesters?

01:06:21.937 --> 01:06:23.314
Is that it?

01:06:23.731 --> 01:06:24.771
He's not a child molester.

01:06:24.815 --> 01:06:27.735
You were 15
and he was your English teacher.

01:06:27.818 --> 01:06:28.944
You didn't see the way he treated me.

01:06:29.028 --> 01:06:32.156
He wanted to fuck you.
Who are you to judge, okay?

01:06:32.239 --> 01:06:34.679
You've had boyfriends
since you were in the fifth grade, okay?

01:06:34.742 --> 01:06:36.869
I was 15. I had never been kissed before.

01:06:37.286 --> 01:06:39.663
So what if he was my teacher?
So what?

01:06:39.747 --> 01:06:41.749
He made me feel good!
He made me feel good about myself!

01:06:41.832 --> 01:06:44.752
I don't want to hear how he made you feel.
You know what?

01:06:44.835 --> 01:06:48.088
You wanna go hang out with Rich Levitt,
go ahead. I am not gonna stop you.

01:06:48.172 --> 01:06:52.593
But when all that shit went down,
I know, looking back, I was right.

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:54.929
And I can't feel guilty about it anymore.

01:06:55.763 --> 01:06:57.181
And it could've been a lot worse.

01:06:57.264 --> 01:06:58.825
He could've gone to fucking jail, Milo.

01:06:58.849 --> 01:06:59.975
Do you realize that?

01:07:00.059 --> 01:07:01.852
He is lucky that we dealt
with this quietly.

01:07:01.936 --> 01:07:04.188
And I know you blame me,
and I know you think

01:07:04.271 --> 01:07:06.857
I ruined this blossoming relationship
between you and him.

01:07:06.941 --> 01:07:09.527
I know you think I ruined his life,
that I ruined your life,

01:07:10.027 --> 01:07:11.108
but I did what I had to do.

01:07:11.111 --> 01:07:13.531
Look, it had nothing to do with you.

01:07:13.614 --> 01:07:15.032
That is bullshit.

01:07:17.117 --> 01:07:18.410
You're my brother.

01:07:21.872 --> 01:07:23.874
And we're supposed to
be there for each other.

01:07:25.125 --> 01:07:28.128
And if you don't get that by now, then,

01:07:29.255 --> 01:07:31.131
I don't know, I guess I'll talk
to you in another 10 years.

01:07:31.215 --> 01:07:33.008
Maggie, wait.
This sucks.

01:07:34.301 --> 01:07:36.971
I was having such a good night with you.

01:08:06.125 --> 01:08:07.751
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday...

01:08:10.754 --> 01:08:12.381
Sunday, Monday...

01:08:15.175 --> 01:08:16.885
Oh, shit.

01:08:42.953 --> 01:08:44.955
Morning, chief.
Morning.

01:08:45.331 --> 01:08:48.042
Well, looks like your sis
is down for the count.

01:08:48.125 --> 01:08:51.502
I think she's got, like,
food poisoning or something.

01:08:52.129 --> 01:08:53.756
Right, or something.

01:08:53.839 --> 01:08:55.549
Maybe we should have a dude's day.

01:08:55.883 --> 01:08:58.636
A what?
You know, dude's day.

01:09:00.845 --> 01:09:02.305
I think your version of dude's day

01:09:02.389 --> 01:09:05.600
and my version of dude's day
are totally different.

01:09:11.398 --> 01:09:12.483
Oh, shit.

01:09:13.567 --> 01:09:15.069
Oh, shit!

01:09:15.486 --> 01:09:17.404
Come on, man. You almost had it that time.

01:09:17.738 --> 01:09:21.116
Lance, this harness has my balls
in my fucking throat.

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:22.242
Can I please come down?

01:09:22.326 --> 01:09:24.578
It's all part of the experience, buddy boy.

01:09:24.953 --> 01:09:28.832
The only good thing about this experience
is that every guy in here's gorgeous.

01:09:28.916 --> 01:09:30.334
Yeah, it's great here, man.

01:09:30.417 --> 01:09:32.711
You're surrounded by a bunch of hunks.
It's beautiful.

01:09:33.087 --> 01:09:35.756
Come on, you gotta use the pain.
Get inspired by it.

01:09:35.881 --> 01:09:38.509
What are you, some sort of,
like, climbing Nazi?

01:09:38.591 --> 01:09:40.135
I just believe in you, that's all.

01:09:40.219 --> 01:09:42.011
Come on, I saw you out there
working at the park.

01:09:42.095 --> 01:09:43.680
You got it in you, dude. I believe in you.

01:09:43.764 --> 01:09:46.433
Come on.
You're such a piece of shit, Lance.

01:09:47.935 --> 01:09:49.978
Yeah, awesome. Awesome.

01:09:50.062 --> 01:09:52.689
Just keep doing it just like that, man.

01:09:54.817 --> 01:09:57.277
That's what I'm talking about!
Boo-ya, dude!

01:09:57.820 --> 01:09:59.488
To dude's day.
To dude's day.

01:09:59.947 --> 01:10:04.284
I gotta tell you, you were channeling
my middle school P.E. teacher out there.

01:10:04.368 --> 01:10:06.245
Yeah, you were into it, huh?

01:10:07.121 --> 01:10:09.832
Yeah, it was very... You're
very motivating. Thank you.

01:10:09.915 --> 01:10:11.583
You're gonna be a good dad someday.
That was good.

01:10:11.667 --> 01:10:12.710
Thanks, man.

01:10:12.793 --> 01:10:14.211
It's funny, 'cause all my buddies,

01:10:14.294 --> 01:10:16.880
they're scared shitless about
the whole fatherhood thing,

01:10:16.964 --> 01:10:19.800
and, yeah, I just know
that I'm ready for it.

01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:24.054
That's why the whole pregnancy thing
has been frustrating, you know?

01:10:24.138 --> 01:10:27.516
Just wanna make sure
I'm not firing blanks, you know?

01:10:27.850 --> 01:10:28.934
Right.

01:10:29.017 --> 01:10:30.561
Guess I'm just a little paranoid.

01:10:33.313 --> 01:10:37.234
Have you noticed
her acting a little strange at all lately?

01:10:37.317 --> 01:10:39.820
Like, I mean...

01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:43.657
I don't know what I mean.

01:10:43.991 --> 01:10:45.409
I know what you mean, yeah.

01:10:45.492 --> 01:10:47.703
It'll all happen in Hawaii.
That's how I feel.

01:10:47.786 --> 01:10:50.956
Just in between
the trade winds and the palm trees

01:10:51.039 --> 01:10:56.170
and the people and,
you know, exotic spices.

01:10:56.295 --> 01:10:57.379
Yeah.

01:10:57.463 --> 01:10:58.881
Maybe we'll do it in a hammock.

01:11:00.507 --> 01:11:02.634
Hawaii's definitely baby-making country.

01:11:04.845 --> 01:11:09.308
You know, Maggie can be very secretive.

01:11:09.725 --> 01:11:10.893
Like, when we were kids and stuff,

01:11:10.976 --> 01:11:14.521
she would hide cigarettes
and things like that around the house.

01:11:16.565 --> 01:11:19.026
You know, places you
wouldn't think to look.

01:11:19.651 --> 01:11:23.322
Maybe there's some medication or
something that's affecting things.

01:11:24.031 --> 01:11:25.032
Just a thought.

01:11:26.283 --> 01:11:29.203
Yeah, I don't think Maggie'd
hide something like that from me.

01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:32.456
I'm sure you're right.
Yeah.

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:45.052
Hey, miss, do you need help with anything?

01:11:46.637 --> 01:11:50.390
Yeah, you know what? I'm... I just...

01:11:52.059 --> 01:11:53.268
I'm a little late.

01:11:53.352 --> 01:11:54.728
But not seriously late, just a little.

01:11:54.812 --> 01:11:57.147
But I'm... You know what?
I don't need this.

01:11:57.231 --> 01:11:59.858
I'm fine, thanks.

01:12:03.904 --> 01:12:06.657
Thank you for putting that back. Thanks.

01:12:09.243 --> 01:12:11.245
What else did I need?

01:12:16.041 --> 01:12:18.168
Puked all over the field.

01:12:18.335 --> 01:12:20.254
Maggie Dean?

01:12:21.672 --> 01:12:23.257
It's Carlie Van der Hoff.

01:12:23.382 --> 01:12:24.466
Garfield High?

01:12:25.092 --> 01:12:28.220
Yeah, hi.
Yeah, my God! How are you?

01:12:28.512 --> 01:12:31.223
I'm fine.
Oh, this is Cullen.

01:12:31.849 --> 01:12:33.058
Say hi, Cullen.
Hi.

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:35.727
He's the oldest of my rug rats.

01:12:36.103 --> 01:12:37.771
Yeah, but look at you.

01:12:38.272 --> 01:12:39.606
Are you visiting family?

01:12:39.857 --> 01:12:41.191
No, no, I live here.

01:12:41.775 --> 01:12:42.734
Really?
Yeah.

01:12:42.818 --> 01:12:45.362
That's so weird
that we've never run into each other.

01:12:45.445 --> 01:12:47.906
Yeah.
I'm at the school employees credit union.

01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:49.449
Mom.
Cullen, hush.

01:12:49.616 --> 01:12:50.868
If you're bored, go wait in the car.

01:12:50.951 --> 01:12:52.494
Oh, I'm gonna be leaving.
Beat it.

01:12:52.828 --> 01:12:55.455
Kiss my ass!
Hey, you watch it, mister!

01:12:56.331 --> 01:12:57.416
Back at ya!

01:13:00.294 --> 01:13:01.587
What a little shit.

01:13:02.045 --> 01:13:04.506
Can you believe kids today? The attitudes.

01:13:05.382 --> 01:13:07.217
Do you have kids?
No.

01:13:07.801 --> 01:13:11.263
Well, you're lucky
because they are little shits.

01:13:13.515 --> 01:13:16.143
So, how are you? How's Milo?

01:13:16.476 --> 01:13:17.728
Tell me everything.

01:13:18.812 --> 01:13:20.230
I'm all right.

01:13:20.314 --> 01:13:22.107
You got married?
I did.

01:13:22.441 --> 01:13:25.944
Of course, you always had
so many boyfriends.

01:13:30.908 --> 01:13:31.950
Oh, boy.

01:13:32.492 --> 01:13:33.911
Are you okay?

01:13:36.288 --> 01:13:38.624
Carlie, can you...
Can you give me one second?

01:13:38.957 --> 01:13:40.000
Yeah.
Be right back.

01:13:44.338 --> 01:13:47.507
Thank you, thank you. Oh, thank...

01:14:04.608 --> 01:14:05.859
It's over.

01:14:09.029 --> 01:14:11.740
No, for real.

01:14:19.164 --> 01:14:20.165
Hi.

01:14:21.708 --> 01:14:24.252
Honey, what's going on here?

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:30.342
Those are old.

01:14:31.635 --> 01:14:37.265
Okay, well, the prescription says
that they're from last month, so...

01:14:46.316 --> 01:14:48.402
Honey, I'm sorry that...

01:15:00.247 --> 01:15:01.832
Listen...

01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:06.586
If you don't want to have kids right now,

01:15:07.504 --> 01:15:10.132
we can talk about that, okay?

01:15:13.051 --> 01:15:15.178
You don't need to lie to me.

01:15:21.393 --> 01:15:24.813
Sweetie, you're freaking me out right now.

01:15:28.275 --> 01:15:30.485
I'm a sick person, Lance.

01:15:32.279 --> 01:15:33.947
What do you mean?

01:15:39.036 --> 01:15:42.956
I've been with other men
since we've been married.

01:15:45.876 --> 01:15:47.210
Three.

01:15:49.421 --> 01:15:51.298
Three other men.

01:15:53.133 --> 01:15:56.970
I wasn't in love with any of them.
I know that doesn't matter.

01:16:00.474 --> 01:16:02.309
I'm so sorry.

01:16:09.733 --> 01:16:11.109
I'm sorry.

01:16:14.279 --> 01:16:15.489
Lance?

01:16:39.346 --> 01:16:41.473
Look, he was confused.
I felt terrible for him.

01:16:41.556 --> 01:16:43.266
Hey!
You had no right!

01:16:43.350 --> 01:16:44.684
Things were gonna crash down eventually.

01:16:44.768 --> 01:16:46.103
No, you were just trying to get back at me.

01:16:46.186 --> 01:16:48.939
I was trying to help you.
You just ruined my marriage.

01:16:49.022 --> 01:16:50.857
What marriage?
Fuck you.

01:16:51.608 --> 01:16:52.818
Look, you're miserable,

01:16:52.901 --> 01:16:55.153
and if you're too chicken shit
to do anything about it, then I will.

01:16:55.237 --> 01:16:56.738
Oh, so, you know what's best for me?

01:16:56.822 --> 01:16:58.657
Yes, you're my sister.
We're supposed to help each other out.

01:16:58.740 --> 01:17:00.158
You said that.
This is different!

01:17:00.242 --> 01:17:02.577
How?
We are adults. This is my marriage.

01:17:02.661 --> 01:17:05.141
If you think that's a marriage,
then you're fucking nuts, okay?

01:17:05.205 --> 01:17:08.125
I'm sorry. Enjoy your marital bliss.
Okay, yeah, go. Leave anyway.

01:17:08.208 --> 01:17:09.376
This is not working out.

01:17:10.127 --> 01:17:12.671
You know what the sad thing is?
Ls that we're a good team.

01:17:12.754 --> 01:17:15.590
Oh, yeah, and you'd be a real hoot to
have around if you weren't such a fuckup.

01:17:15.799 --> 01:17:17.300
We're both fuckups, okay?

01:17:17.384 --> 01:17:19.545
And I'm tired of you acting
like you're the healthy one

01:17:19.553 --> 01:17:20.971
and I'm your special needs kid.

01:17:21.054 --> 01:17:23.014
What does it even matter anymore, Milo?

01:17:23.098 --> 01:17:24.641
You got your revenge. You got it.

01:17:24.724 --> 01:17:25.809
I was trying to lay it out on the table.

01:17:25.892 --> 01:17:26.893
That's what I was trying to do.

01:17:27.018 --> 01:17:28.061
You wanna lay it out on the table?
Yes!

01:17:28.145 --> 01:17:29.646
Okay, then, go for it.

01:17:29.771 --> 01:17:31.857
You're emotionally unstable.
You're a prick.

01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:33.525
You need professional help.

01:17:33.608 --> 01:17:36.069
And this coming from a guy
who just tried to kill himself.

01:17:36.570 --> 01:17:38.655
Maybe I should try
fucking all my problems away.

01:17:39.406 --> 01:17:41.741
Well, maybe next time
you should cut deeper.

01:18:10.604 --> 01:18:13.815
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:18:13.899 --> 01:18:15.483
Shit.

01:18:16.985 --> 01:18:18.153
Fuck.

01:18:20.739 --> 01:18:22.908
Come on. Fuck.

01:18:24.618 --> 01:18:26.786
Come on, come on, come on.

01:18:27.412 --> 01:18:28.872
There we go. There we go.

01:18:30.373 --> 01:18:32.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah. There you go.

01:18:32.334 --> 01:18:33.960
Come on!

01:18:35.837 --> 01:18:36.963
Come on!

01:18:57.317 --> 01:19:00.195
Hey, I know I'm not supposed
to come over here or anything,

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:04.616
but I want to talk to you,
and I think you owe me that.

01:19:06.284 --> 01:19:08.453
You owe me. That's what I think.

01:19:30.892 --> 01:19:33.770
Listen, I'm sure your sister
didn't mean what she said.

01:19:36.147 --> 01:19:38.191
So, how do you make this work?

01:19:38.275 --> 01:19:42.612
Like, how do you juggle a girlfriend
and a son with guys like me?

01:19:43.238 --> 01:19:45.156
Well, there aren't a lot of guys like you.

01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:47.951
Thanks, Teach.

01:19:48.034 --> 01:19:50.620
No, not... I mean, it's not a pattern.

01:19:51.121 --> 01:19:52.539
Are you gay?

01:20:01.548 --> 01:20:05.885
I can make it work with Melinda,
and I really want to.

01:20:08.221 --> 01:20:09.848
Well, good luck with that.

01:20:16.104 --> 01:20:19.441
Don't... Can you...
What are you fucking doing, man?

01:20:19.524 --> 01:20:20.804
That's not why I came over here.

01:20:21.151 --> 01:20:23.695
Milo...
What am I, some sort of forbidden fruit?

01:20:23.778 --> 01:20:25.196
No.
Or, like, some sort of...

01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:28.491
What am I, like, a blow-up doll?
What am I to you?

01:20:32.078 --> 01:20:35.373
I treated you terribly. I know that. But...

01:20:37.792 --> 01:20:40.670
It's not because I don't care or because...

01:20:42.797 --> 01:20:44.507
I don't respect you...

01:20:45.925 --> 01:20:48.261
or because I don't love you.

01:20:51.639 --> 01:20:54.517
It's because I'm a big pussy. That's it.

01:20:55.018 --> 01:20:58.438
I'm just a huge, pathetic pussy.

01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:05.612
I could never be you.

01:21:12.452 --> 01:21:15.205
You can crash on the couch, if you want.

01:21:24.089 --> 01:21:26.091
Did you, by chance, read my script?

01:21:28.134 --> 01:21:29.386
Yeah.

01:21:29.803 --> 01:21:31.096
And?

01:21:32.180 --> 01:21:33.348
It's great.

01:21:34.015 --> 01:21:36.559
I'll definitely give it to my agent.

01:22:47.714 --> 01:22:51.801
Once again, this is the 528 leaving Nyack
for Port Authority Bus Terminal.

01:22:55.472 --> 01:22:59.017
I would do anything to
take back what I said.

01:23:00.810 --> 01:23:03.688
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

01:23:07.734 --> 01:23:09.444
I love you.

01:23:11.112 --> 01:23:12.739
I screwed it up.

01:23:13.615 --> 01:23:15.575
I do that a lot, I guess.

01:23:15.909 --> 01:23:17.452
It's kind of my thing.

01:23:19.245 --> 01:23:20.788
But I get it.

01:23:21.289 --> 01:23:22.665
Dad just...

01:23:23.833 --> 01:23:25.502
saw a way out.

01:23:26.586 --> 01:23:28.421
I guess you did, too.

01:23:39.724 --> 01:23:41.976
I'm not scared anymore.

01:23:44.103 --> 01:23:46.105
I finally get it.

01:23:47.899 --> 01:23:49.609
See you later.

01:25:36.966 --> 01:25:39.218
Breathe, breathe, breathe. You're okay.

01:25:39.594 --> 01:25:41.054
Are you okay?

01:25:44.349 --> 01:25:45.433
You're okay.

01:25:45.516 --> 01:25:47.393
All right, say something.
Just say something.

01:25:48.478 --> 01:25:49.979
I'm okay.
You're okay.

01:25:50.104 --> 01:25:51.939
You're okay, Jesus. You're okay.

01:25:54.942 --> 01:25:56.653
Breathe, you're okay.

01:25:57.236 --> 01:25:58.655
You're here.

01:26:01.449 --> 01:26:02.784
I'm here.

01:26:08.373 --> 01:26:09.874
You're here.
