WEBVTT

00:00.915 --> 00:02.226
Almost ready.

00:03.211 --> 00:06.378
All right. All right.
Lily, I love you to pieces,

00:06.379 --> 00:09.451
but you're the most
high-maintenance dog ever.

00:09.574 --> 00:12.602
Is that because your owner indulges you?

00:13.999 --> 00:15.086
There he is.

00:18.674 --> 00:19.690
- Hi.
- Catch.

00:19.691 --> 00:20.571
Oh!

00:21.250 --> 00:23.234
- It's a game ball from last night.
- Really?

00:23.438 --> 00:25.497
Is that heavenly smell breakfast?

00:25.498 --> 00:27.565
- Um...
- 'Cause I've been driving all night

00:27.566 --> 00:30.477
on turkey jerky and cold coffee,

00:30.478 --> 00:33.011
and this belly could use a real good meal.

00:33.012 --> 00:34.189
Oh, yeah, a-actually, that...

00:34.190 --> 00:37.391
Beautiful girl, you are a
sight for these tired eyes.

00:38.072 --> 00:40.834
Oh, yes. I missed the
hell out of you, girl.

00:40.835 --> 00:42.834
- Oh, yes.
- Ooh.

00:42.835 --> 00:44.661
Well, um, I'll let the two of you

00:44.662 --> 00:45.970
get reacquainted.

00:45.971 --> 00:49.060
- Hey, thanks for taking care of her.
- You're welcome.

00:50.150 --> 00:51.397
It's great to see you.

00:52.282 --> 00:53.355
I mean it.

00:55.405 --> 00:56.934
Um, if... you know,
if... if you're hungry,

00:56.935 --> 00:58.461
I could... I could,
you know, I could...

00:58.462 --> 00:59.166
You okay?

00:59.167 --> 01:01.374
Oh, yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

01:02.526 --> 01:04.598
- You've been, you know,
driving a long time. - Yeah.

01:04.599 --> 01:06.941
I bet you... you'd like to, uh...
you know...

01:06.942 --> 01:08.158
- Have a shower.
- I was thinking that.

01:08.159 --> 01:11.198
Yeah, well, the water pressure
in the R.V. isn't so hot.

01:11.646 --> 01:13.999
Come to think of it, neither
is the water. Yeah.

01:14.735 --> 01:17.846
Uh, so I've got showers.
A lot of... up there.

01:17.882 --> 01:19.402
- You know, you can use Kitty's room.
- Oh.

01:19.403 --> 01:21.570
- It's the first door on the right.
- Thanks.

01:21.571 --> 01:23.069
- Yeah.
- I'll go get some clean clothes.

01:23.070 --> 01:25.774
- Okay.
- Yeah. All right.

01:29.637 --> 01:30.741
Lily.

01:37.376 --> 01:38.817
Sarah, quick question.

01:39.478 --> 01:41.701
How long do you think it'll
be until the auto industry

01:41.702 --> 01:43.182
introduces a flying car?

01:43.183 --> 01:45.357
Kevin, I do not have time
to listen to you

01:45.358 --> 01:47.176
have a psychotic episode this morning.

01:47.177 --> 01:49.136
Now that we officially
have custody of Olivia,

01:49.137 --> 01:50.493
I'm perfectly healthy, thank you.

01:50.494 --> 01:53.013
I've just been reading the
"30 things to do by 30" list

01:53.014 --> 01:54.404
that Justin wrote when he was 15,

01:54.405 --> 01:57.532
and number four...
"have sex in a flying car."

01:57.533 --> 01:59.889
I can't believe our little
brother is turning 30.

01:59.890 --> 02:01.460
Yeah, I don't think he can either.

02:01.461 --> 02:03.617
I'm at his place right now
hoping this list will help.

02:03.618 --> 02:05.110
You know he canceled
his trip to Mammoth

02:05.111 --> 02:06.016
with Dan and his friends?

02:06.017 --> 02:07.001
I'm sure the ski bunnies

02:07.002 --> 02:09.246
- in hot tubs will be devastated.
- Yeah, I know,

02:09.247 --> 02:11.580
but we can't let Justin
blow off his 30th birthday.

02:11.581 --> 02:13.157
Justin is blowing off his birthday?

02:13.158 --> 02:14.532
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, hey, Luc. Yeah.

02:14.533 --> 02:17.463
I feel so old.
I-I can barely remember my 30th.

02:17.464 --> 02:18.888
You don't remember your
30th 'cause you were

02:18.889 --> 02:22.081
- ripping Tequila shots and then you
threw up on Joe. - Okay, Kevin,

02:22.082 --> 02:24.651
it was my last hurrah before
babies and breast-feeding.

02:24.657 --> 02:25.875
Number 14...

02:25.876 --> 02:28.356
"jump into the chocolate
river at Hershey Park."

02:28.471 --> 02:30.597
I'm guessing somebody wasn't
sober when he wrote that.

02:30.598 --> 02:32.597
I'm gonna call mom.
She'll know what to do.

02:32.862 --> 02:33.901
Hold on.

02:37.791 --> 02:38.577
What?

02:38.578 --> 02:40.876
Wow. You sound like you're
in a good mood, mom.

02:40.877 --> 02:42.533
I'm in a fine mood.
What do you want?

02:42.534 --> 02:44.259
Justin canceled his ski trip,

02:44.260 --> 02:46.761
and we've been left holding
the birthday bag. Any ideas?

02:46.762 --> 02:48.972
I don't know.
How about a dinner at my house?

02:48.973 --> 02:50.626
What, another dinner party?
Come on, mom.

02:50.627 --> 02:52.078
Start thinking outside the wine box.

02:52.079 --> 02:53.882
And hello to you, too, Kevin.

02:53.883 --> 02:56.406
Since when is dinner at
my house not good enough?

02:56.407 --> 02:58.201
- What about a dance party?
- Oh, yeah.

02:58.202 --> 02:59.637
Perfect. Scotty could
shut the restaurant,

02:59.638 --> 03:00.667
and we can get a deejay.

03:00.668 --> 03:02.447
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What about a disco ball?

03:02.448 --> 03:03.984
- You must get a disco ball.
- You're out of control.

03:03.985 --> 03:06.361
Stop right there. Justin hates dancing.

03:06.362 --> 03:10.543
Look, honestly, I-I'll just do
a fabulous dinner at my house.

03:10.544 --> 03:13.004
- Where are the towels?
- Is somebody there?

03:13.005 --> 03:14.406
- No.
- Never mind. I found 'em.

03:14.407 --> 03:16.559
- Is Brody back?
- Yes.

03:16.560 --> 03:17.438
How long's he staying?

03:17.439 --> 03:19.521
Oh, I don't know. Not long.

03:19.522 --> 03:22.466
That's it? You're just another
doggy day care to him?

03:22.492 --> 03:25.418
- That and a laundromat. - Oh, please,
tell me you're not doing his...

03:25.419 --> 03:27.578
Not doing his what, Sarah, his laundry?

03:28.563 --> 03:31.155
Don't be silly.
Why would I do his laundry?

03:32.231 --> 03:33.415
I gotta go. Bye.

03:34.012 --> 03:35.472
- Kevin.
- Hey.

03:35.710 --> 03:38.382
Hey. Who were you just talking to?

03:38.622 --> 03:39.566
No one.

03:41.018 --> 03:42.285
We were just planning your birthday party.

03:42.286 --> 03:44.157
No. I told you, I don't
want a birthday party.

03:44.158 --> 03:45.377
That's why I canceled the ski trip.

03:45.378 --> 03:46.877
Oh, come on.
You're just saying that now.

03:46.878 --> 03:48.377
No, I'm not just saying that.
All right?

03:48.378 --> 03:50.425
Turning 30 is gonna suck.
And you know what?

03:50.426 --> 03:52.326
Kitty skipped her 40th,
so I'm skipping this one.

03:52.327 --> 03:54.118
Look, 30 freaks everyone out.

03:54.125 --> 03:56.167
I developed a crippling
self-tanning obsession

03:56.168 --> 03:57.954
just to cope with mine.
It was a sad orange time.

03:57.955 --> 03:59.137
Look, I'm sure it was really sad.

03:59.138 --> 04:00.539
But you know what?
I just worked a night shift,

04:00.540 --> 04:01.126
and I'm going to bed.

04:01.127 --> 04:03.257
And please don't break in to my home.
It's creepy.

04:03.258 --> 04:04.623
Wait. Look, I have coffee

04:04.624 --> 04:07.729
and something I think
will make you very happy.

04:09.070 --> 04:10.830
What are you talking about?

04:11.370 --> 04:12.233
Ta-da.

04:12.234 --> 04:13.513
Oh, my God. I gave this to you?

04:13.514 --> 04:16.502
Isn't it amazing?
We're gonna do every item on this list.

04:16.866 --> 04:18.826
You know someone with a flying car?

04:19.041 --> 04:21.236
Every item that doesn't
require time travel.

04:21.237 --> 04:22.999
"Tell mom what I really think of her"?

04:23.000 --> 04:25.241
Oh, yeah, remember?
She confiscated your discman.

04:25.242 --> 04:28.802
Oh, yeah. Wait. Why...
You're doing this with me because?

04:28.803 --> 04:30.569
Because you're my brother
and I love you.

04:30.570 --> 04:31.866
You're lying to my face.

04:32.884 --> 04:34.397
Okay. Scotty's mom
is coming to stay.

04:34.398 --> 04:37.532
- Oh. - And I have to be around her
as little as humanly possible.

04:38.002 --> 04:39.970
So what about...

04:40.353 --> 04:42.243
a little "street fighter",
old-school style?

04:42.244 --> 04:43.238
- Wait. That's on the list?
- Yeah.

04:43.239 --> 04:44.763
"Beat 'street fighter' in one session."
You in?

04:44.764 --> 04:47.138
Uh, yes. Let's do it.

04:47.139 --> 04:48.226
Do you like this one?

04:48.926 --> 04:51.090
Uh, yes, I love it.

04:51.091 --> 04:52.667
But how could I not? It's of me.

04:52.719 --> 04:56.148
- Okay, bag, phone, computer,
keys... - What are you doing?

04:56.149 --> 04:58.070
- Uh, going to work.
- What about Benoit?

04:58.446 --> 04:59.174
He's coming in a few minutes.

04:59.175 --> 05:01.558
I know. I just got a text.
I've got a situation at work

05:01.559 --> 05:02.553
I've gotta deal with. Can we postpone?

05:02.554 --> 05:04.233
Hey, you're not
the only one who's busy.

05:04.234 --> 05:06.314
This is my first solo show in Los Angeles.

05:06.608 --> 05:08.246
We need to focus.
We have a wedding to plan.

05:08.247 --> 05:11.521
- And Benoit is our only hope?
- You told me this morning was okay.

05:11.522 --> 05:14.561
- Yes, I'm sorry. I just...
This can't wait. - I can't believe

05:14.562 --> 05:16.950
you're leaving me here all
alone to deal with this.

05:17.142 --> 05:19.114
I'm a guy. I don't know
what I'm doing.

05:19.115 --> 05:20.733
Just listen to his ideas

05:20.734 --> 05:22.862
and get the Benoit ball rolling.

05:25.295 --> 05:27.346
- Fine.
- Thank you. I love you for this.

05:31.666 --> 05:32.691
I have a proposition.

05:32.692 --> 05:34.201
No, I am not taking ballroom classes

05:34.202 --> 05:34.714
with you, Jonathan.

05:34.715 --> 05:37.956
I had a horrendously humiliating experience

05:37.957 --> 05:40.711
with the waltz in junior high, so...

05:44.387 --> 05:45.849
Speaking of junior high.

05:45.850 --> 05:46.889
It's my mother.

05:46.890 --> 05:48.298
Mom, I'll talk to you later.

05:48.299 --> 05:50.907
I swear, I will never
make you dance in public.

05:52.140 --> 05:54.124
This is about a house.

05:54.638 --> 05:55.437
A house?

05:55.438 --> 05:57.781
Now don't worry, Saul.
I'm not asking you to move in with me.

05:57.989 --> 06:00.551
I'm buying a house in Palm Springs.

06:00.569 --> 06:03.775
It's beautiful, mid-century, great views.

06:04.143 --> 06:05.645
It needs a lot of work, but, um...

06:05.646 --> 06:07.682
So you want to restore a
house in Palm Springs?

06:07.683 --> 06:09.353
Yeah. I thought we could do it together.

06:09.393 --> 06:11.973
You know, go there on weekends
whenever you want, uh, holidays.

06:11.974 --> 06:13.494
You could even invite your family.

06:17.090 --> 06:18.226
You know what?

06:19.319 --> 06:21.482
Things are going along
so well here with us.

06:21.483 --> 06:22.843
I-I just...

06:23.402 --> 06:24.888
I just don't want to tempt fate.

06:25.624 --> 06:27.720
You know, like my mother used
to say, "kein ayin hara."

06:28.067 --> 06:29.921
Beware the envious evil eye.

06:29.922 --> 06:31.079
Well, if you're worried about the evil eye,

06:31.080 --> 06:32.255
I'm giving you guys fair warning.

06:32.256 --> 06:34.063
My mother's coming
in a matter of hours.

06:34.064 --> 06:35.565
Well, maybe I have to call Ida back

06:35.566 --> 06:37.231
- so the two of them can entertain
each other. - How about that?

06:37.232 --> 06:40.409
She called this morning and said
she's "popping by" from Arizona.

06:40.410 --> 06:41.932
You seem a little, uh, anxious.

06:41.933 --> 06:43.890
Oh, no, this isn't anxiety. It's dread.

06:43.891 --> 06:44.929
There's a big difference.

06:44.930 --> 06:46.393
She's meeting Olivia for the first time.

06:46.394 --> 06:48.207
- And where's Kevin?
- Hiding.

06:48.208 --> 06:51.434
- What's with the tablecloth?
- Oh, well, last time she was here,

06:51.435 --> 06:53.650
she said our dining room
table was too modern.

06:53.651 --> 06:55.937
I didn't want to spend the next
couple of days discussing it.

06:55.938 --> 06:57.651
Not that we ever discuss anything.
I open my mouth

06:57.652 --> 06:59.773
to say something, and she
goes completely deaf.

06:59.774 --> 07:00.814
Well, just don't take the bait.

07:00.815 --> 07:03.267
You know, I used to think it
was all about me being gay,

07:03.268 --> 07:04.532
but I realized,

07:04.698 --> 07:08.009
she doesn't approve of
anything I've done, ever.

07:08.347 --> 07:10.310
I can't wait to hear what she
has to say about my parenting.

07:10.311 --> 07:12.469
All right, wait a minute.
So she's judgmental.

07:12.470 --> 07:15.471
What's the big deal?
If you had grown up with my mother,

07:15.472 --> 07:17.125
you would've learned very quickly

07:17.172 --> 07:19.424
that the only way to survive
is to be proud of who you are.

07:19.425 --> 07:20.562
That's easier said than done, Saul.

07:20.563 --> 07:22.131
You still haven't told
your mother you're gay.

07:25.031 --> 07:28.070
Your mother doesn't know you're gay?

07:28.103 --> 07:29.414
Yeah, well...

07:31.878 --> 07:34.055
Why would I tell her something like that?

07:34.551 --> 07:35.765
Because that's who you are.

07:35.766 --> 07:37.238
No, it's nothing like that.

07:39.566 --> 07:40.583
Anyway, it's too late now.

07:40.584 --> 07:43.381
She's just... she's not all there.

07:43.382 --> 07:45.164
Well, neither are you...

07:45.261 --> 07:47.950
If you're carrying around
a secret like that.

07:51.191 --> 07:53.574
Oh, thanks. That shower felt good.

07:53.606 --> 07:55.953
Well, you clean up nicely.

07:55.954 --> 07:58.203
Hopefully your clothes will do the same.

07:58.204 --> 07:59.723
What do you do, play in the dirt?

07:59.724 --> 08:01.722
Actually, I do. That's my job.

08:01.723 --> 08:03.291
- Oh.
- Whatcha doin'?

08:03.423 --> 08:06.338
Well, I-I'm planning a
30th birthday for Justin,

08:06.339 --> 08:08.304
and then Sarah is getting married, so...

08:08.305 --> 08:09.666
How about dinner and a movie?

08:09.667 --> 08:12.035
It's the least I can do
after you took care of...

08:14.679 --> 08:16.566
Oh. It's my mother.

08:17.420 --> 08:19.667
I was supposed to visit her
and I didn't.

08:19.668 --> 08:21.745
That's Ida? Don't tell her I'm here.

08:21.746 --> 08:23.717
- She always hated me.
- I know.

08:25.523 --> 08:26.787
Hi, mom.

08:29.656 --> 08:30.999
Oh.

08:32.890 --> 08:34.076
I see.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.465
Could I call you back?

08:40.918 --> 08:43.078
No, I just need to call you back.

08:45.948 --> 08:48.667
Good. Thank you. Bye.

08:51.816 --> 08:53.063
Is everything all right?

08:56.442 --> 08:57.658
She died...

08:58.087 --> 08:59.417
This morning.

09:01.079 --> 09:02.471
She died?

09:04.120 --> 09:05.497
My mother died.

09:09.575 --> 09:12.375
I guess I have to plan
a funeral now, too.

09:29.392 --> 09:30.337
This is delicious.

09:30.338 --> 09:32.999
- You should definitely go with the lemon.
- I don't know, Kevin.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.358
Wait. Is that marzipan?

09:34.359 --> 09:37.169
- Yeah.
- Oh, good. You're all here.

09:37.170 --> 09:38.790
Yeah, we, uh, we came as soon as we heard.

09:38.791 --> 09:39.721
Okay, this won't take long.

09:39.722 --> 09:41.804
- I gotta get back for a conference call.
- You okay?

09:41.805 --> 09:45.386
- Yeah... Oh, my God. Please tell me
that's dead. - No, it's synthetic.

09:45.387 --> 09:46.689
Feel the feathers... unbelievable.

09:46.690 --> 09:48.206
Yeah, it's an inspirational piece.

09:48.207 --> 09:49.922
We will have live ones at the wedding.

09:50.430 --> 09:51.582
You're kidding.

09:51.911 --> 09:54.406
- Okay, Benoit got a little carried away.
- You think?

09:54.407 --> 09:56.803
- Bad timing.
- Kevin, what are you eating?

09:56.804 --> 09:59.097
- Cake samples. This one's marzipan.
- Would you please stop?

09:59.098 --> 10:01.186
I doubt that's appropriate at this time.

10:01.187 --> 10:02.585
What? I'm drowning my grief.

10:02.586 --> 10:05.706
- In what, icing? - Okay, guys.
Can we please talk about this?

10:06.425 --> 10:08.296
How's, uh, how's mom?

10:09.653 --> 10:10.901
I can't really tell.

10:10.902 --> 10:13.345
I mean, she's thrown herself
into organizing the funeral.

10:13.346 --> 10:14.926
Don't worry.
It won't be on your birthday.

10:14.957 --> 10:17.274
- Uh, I wasn't worried, Kevin.
- You know what?

10:17.275 --> 10:18.677
You should get mom to call Benoit.

10:18.678 --> 10:20.280
He could hook her up with this baker.

10:21.026 --> 10:22.597
What? People eat cakes at funerals.

10:22.598 --> 10:23.429
Okay, listen,

10:23.430 --> 10:26.325
we've got some things to
discuss and to decide.

10:26.363 --> 10:29.624
Firstly, Tommy and Kitty
won't be making the funeral.

10:29.625 --> 10:30.693
- What?
- How did they get out of it?

10:30.694 --> 10:32.781
- Uh, Kitty's in Boston with Seth.
- That's lame.

10:32.782 --> 10:36.557
Agreed. And Tommy can't get
leave from his new job.

10:36.558 --> 10:37.746
Well, that... that's not right.

10:37.747 --> 10:40.377
It is what it is.
Anyway, mom would like the rest of us

10:40.378 --> 10:42.292
- to say something at the service.
- No way.

10:42.293 --> 10:45.635
- Are you kidding me? - No, Justin.
I'm not kidding you, okay?

10:46.094 --> 10:48.465
Ida hated me.
In fact, she went out of her way

10:48.466 --> 10:49.884
to tell me what a disappointment I was.

10:49.885 --> 10:50.982
Kevin, stop it, all right?

10:50.983 --> 10:52.648
She was our grandmother and she died.

10:52.649 --> 10:54.377
- Show some respect.
- Justin is right.

10:54.378 --> 10:56.385
You guys have to put your
differences aside now.

10:56.386 --> 10:57.826
You know what? She didn't.

10:57.827 --> 11:01.121
Okay, listen, whoever wants to
say something, say something.

11:01.122 --> 11:03.246
If you don't, please
explain to mom yourself.

11:03.247 --> 11:05.104
- Fine.
- All right, next...

11:05.105 --> 11:07.076
Somebody's gonna have to
go to the nursing home

11:07.094 --> 11:08.150
and clean out Ida's stuff.

11:08.151 --> 11:10.317
- I'm sorry. I do not have time
in the next... - I'll do it.

11:10.318 --> 11:12.671
- Thank you. - Justin, you
want me to come with you?

11:13.378 --> 11:14.611
Yeah, sure. That'd be great.

11:14.612 --> 11:17.076
Okay, good. That's it. I gotta get back.

11:17.077 --> 11:18.486
Um, do you think we could get Benoit

11:18.487 --> 11:20.306
to get rid of all this stuff?

11:20.307 --> 11:22.490
Okay, Sarah, I get it.
You don't want swans.

11:22.491 --> 11:24.449
But you should definitely
go with one of these cakes.

11:24.450 --> 11:25.778
They're delicious.

11:36.149 --> 11:37.580
Hi, mom. Good to see you.

11:37.581 --> 11:38.751
Hi, honey.

11:38.830 --> 11:39.519
Ah.

11:39.520 --> 11:40.574
Oh.

11:41.031 --> 11:44.218
It is much nicer up here
than I expected.

11:45.374 --> 11:47.081
I can't believe you live
above the restaurant.

11:47.082 --> 11:49.573
It must get noisy.
How does Olivia sleep?

11:49.574 --> 11:51.875
Well... well, it's a... it's a caffee.
It's not a nightclub.

11:51.876 --> 11:54.310
I am just so grateful
it hasn't closed yet.

11:54.311 --> 11:57.375
Restaurants are such
notoriously bad investments.

11:57.595 --> 11:59.350
Actually, we've doubled our profits

11:59.351 --> 12:00.417
in the last six months.

12:00.418 --> 12:01.418
- Well, that's good.
- Mm.

12:01.419 --> 12:03.198
Especially with Kevin doing the pro bono.

12:03.562 --> 12:05.562
He must have a lot of time on his hands.

12:05.690 --> 12:08.605
But that's nice.
He can be the stay-at-home mom.

12:09.986 --> 12:12.561
Actually, it... it...
it's stay-at-home dad.

12:12.562 --> 12:15.829
And, you know, second,
we share the parenting,

12:15.830 --> 12:19.286
so... what... what is this?

12:20.613 --> 12:22.659
Oh, that's a gift for Olivia.

12:22.775 --> 12:25.158
All the Mexican kids love piñatas.

12:26.082 --> 12:27.586
Oh... wow.

12:27.587 --> 12:30.562
Y-you know, we just had a piñata
at Evan's birthday party.

12:31.495 --> 12:33.424
Maybe we should save this for later.

12:33.425 --> 12:35.117
We wouldn't want to spoil her.

12:35.118 --> 12:36.157
Oh.

12:36.669 --> 12:38.044
Well, when is she gonna be home?

12:38.531 --> 12:40.707
I have so many things planned for us to do.

12:40.782 --> 12:43.348
In a few hours.
Look, um, I should give you a heads-up.

12:43.349 --> 12:44.766
It's a bit of a weird time right now.

12:44.767 --> 12:47.629
Kevin's grandmother just died.
Well, thank goodness I came.

12:47.630 --> 12:49.717
You boys are gonna need
all the help you can get.

12:49.718 --> 12:51.092
Well, actually, we're doing fine.

12:51.093 --> 12:52.820
Not to worry. I'm here now.

12:54.066 --> 12:55.170
I wasn't worried.

12:58.114 --> 12:59.199
Until now.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.902
I need the biggest room,
I'm telling you.

13:02.090 --> 13:04.253
All the children are speaking, as am I,

13:04.254 --> 13:06.526
so I just simply need the bigger room.

13:07.290 --> 13:09.167
Don't let there be a problem.

13:09.168 --> 13:11.264
Just... call me back.

13:11.793 --> 13:12.915
All right, great.

13:14.810 --> 13:15.800
Who are you calling now?

13:15.801 --> 13:18.469
Saul. I've been trying him for two hours.
He doesn't pick up.

13:18.470 --> 13:20.484
Nora, why don't you sit down
for a second, okay?

13:20.485 --> 13:22.492
You've been running around
like a housewife on meth.

13:22.493 --> 13:26.126
- I can't sit down. I have
too many things to do. - Nora, stop.

13:26.359 --> 13:28.151
Your mom just died.

13:28.153 --> 13:30.026
- It's okay to stop.
- I know that.

13:30.781 --> 13:31.888
Okay, good.

13:33.038 --> 13:34.510
So then talk to me.

13:36.591 --> 13:37.822
How are you feeling?

13:39.076 --> 13:40.386
I feel fine.

13:40.443 --> 13:41.427
Really?

13:41.570 --> 13:43.869
Look, it's tragic.
But it was her time.

13:43.870 --> 13:45.561
The circle of life...

13:45.798 --> 13:48.034
Oh, God. Did I just quote
"The lion king"?

13:48.035 --> 13:49.651
I don't know. I never saw it.

13:49.854 --> 13:51.871
Nora. Nora.

13:52.419 --> 13:54.185
Oh, this is gonna be hard.

13:54.186 --> 13:57.046
- Nora, where is he?
- Hi. - Hi, hi, hi.

13:57.047 --> 13:57.541
Saul, I need to talk to you.

13:57.542 --> 13:59.045
Brody, I can't believe I recognize you.

13:59.046 --> 14:00.742
- Saul...
- I know. You were calling me

14:00.743 --> 14:01.690
because you wanted to
tell me Brody was here.

14:01.691 --> 14:03.261
- He's here.
- Yes, no, I need to talk to you.

14:03.262 --> 14:04.575
- Actually, Scotty's so crazy...
- Saul!

14:04.578 --> 14:07.091
- What?
- Saul, mother died.

14:08.451 --> 14:09.666
Mother died.

14:10.689 --> 14:12.807
6.30 this morning, a heart attack.

14:12.851 --> 14:14.066
No.

14:28.738 --> 14:29.481
Hey. Hi.

14:29.482 --> 14:31.466
I just thought you might like
some chocolate chip cookies.

14:32.148 --> 14:34.894
Got a stew going, too, if you'd
like to have a little dinner.

14:35.313 --> 14:37.294
Oh, well, thank you, but I'm...

14:37.295 --> 14:39.905
I'm... I'm really not
very hungry right now.

14:40.216 --> 14:41.449
Okay, how's the speech going?

14:41.738 --> 14:42.854
It's not.

14:43.670 --> 14:45.898
I-I googled "eulogy," and it... and it said

14:45.899 --> 14:48.317
- I should start out with
an... with an outline... - Mm-hmm.

14:48.318 --> 14:50.142
Put the person's name at the top, and then

14:50.143 --> 14:52.602
just put down any thought
that comes to my mind.

14:52.603 --> 14:55.066
- What do you have so far?
- "Ida Holden."

14:55.067 --> 14:57.770
Well, maybe the problem's not
coming up with thoughts,

14:57.771 --> 14:58.417
it's you don't like the

14:58.418 --> 15:00.338
- thoughts you're coming up with.
- Obviously.

15:01.114 --> 15:02.949
I'm speaking at a funeral, though,

15:02.950 --> 15:04.950
not... not in a shrink's office.

15:04.951 --> 15:06.038
Hmm.

15:08.219 --> 15:11.402
What would you say if
you were being honest?

15:12.842 --> 15:14.202
Well, I'd say...

15:15.227 --> 15:17.210
Thank you all very much for coming.

15:18.395 --> 15:20.297
My mother never really liked me.

15:20.298 --> 15:22.339
I was a constant disappointment to her.

15:22.340 --> 15:25.009
- Mm, that's a start. I like that.
- Oh, Brody, stop.

15:25.010 --> 15:26.755
You don't really live your
life like that, do you?

15:26.756 --> 15:27.925
You just say whatever you want?

15:27.926 --> 15:29.796
You don't care what's right
or what people think?

15:29.797 --> 15:31.221
I just don't want to see you stuck

15:31.222 --> 15:32.846
trying to write a stirring tribute

15:32.847 --> 15:35.929
to a woman that we both
know, sometimes, was not...

15:35.930 --> 15:38.202
Uh-huh. Thank you so much.

15:38.425 --> 15:39.741
And when your mother dies,

15:39.742 --> 15:41.926
please feel free to write
whatever you want.

15:41.927 --> 15:43.127
This is my mother.

15:43.482 --> 15:44.730
I...

15:46.278 --> 15:46.929
I-I don't know.

15:46.930 --> 15:49.237
I-I just would like to say something nice,

15:49.238 --> 15:50.667
be a little more appropriate.

15:50.668 --> 15:52.412
Maybe you're too appropriate, Nora.

15:52.838 --> 15:54.881
Look around you. Everything's perfect.

15:54.882 --> 15:56.354
Well, pardon me.

15:56.757 --> 15:58.719
Maybe I should ride around in an R.V.

15:58.720 --> 16:00.363
And get other people to do my laundry.

16:00.364 --> 16:02.323
No, just admit what you're feeling.

16:02.614 --> 16:03.973
Take care of yourself for a change.

16:03.974 --> 16:08.162
Well, that has clearly been
your game plan, Brody.

16:08.163 --> 16:09.673
Yeah, you just take care of yourself,

16:09.674 --> 16:10.577
follow your dreams.

16:10.578 --> 16:12.213
That's what you did 40 years ago.

16:12.214 --> 16:14.274
You went off to be a
big-league baseball star.

16:14.275 --> 16:16.998
- And how did that dream work
out for you... - Not very well.

16:16.999 --> 16:17.930
- Uh-huh.
- But I can live

16:17.931 --> 16:20.939
with what I ended up with.
At least I tried.

16:21.395 --> 16:22.762
Don't try to use my mother's life

16:22.763 --> 16:24.018
to indict mine.

16:24.019 --> 16:26.418
You left mine a long time ago.

16:29.478 --> 16:30.598
I'm sorry.

16:37.583 --> 16:38.878
Just so you know,

16:39.442 --> 16:41.697
I'm still trying to follow my dreams.

16:42.644 --> 16:43.981
That's what I'm doing here.

16:44.690 --> 16:45.811
Good-bye.

16:50.374 --> 16:53.271
Isn't this one beautiful?

16:53.821 --> 16:54.962
It's... ooh.

16:54.963 --> 16:55.921
It's really lacey.

16:55.922 --> 16:58.054
I'm... I'm just not sure
if it's Olivia, though.

16:58.055 --> 17:01.719
Nonsense. You boys have no
idea how to dress girls.

17:02.179 --> 17:04.786
They want dresses and pretty shoes.

17:05.218 --> 17:06.771
Show 'em your new shoes, honey.

17:07.208 --> 17:08.670
- Oh, w-wow.
- Ooh.

17:08.671 --> 17:11.517
Okay, well, you know what?
Lunch is ready. Let's eat.

17:11.518 --> 17:14.060
- Great. - Well, Liv and gamma want
to sit next to each other,

17:14.060 --> 17:15.806
- right, honey bunny?
- Mm.

17:16.406 --> 17:20.490
Oh, you know what would be so pretty?
A French braid.

17:20.498 --> 17:21.834
I could teach you.

17:22.722 --> 17:24.424
Oh... well, maybe after lunch.

17:24.425 --> 17:26.442
Actually, I was thinking Olivia and I

17:26.443 --> 17:28.848
could go to Griffith Park after lunch.

17:29.023 --> 17:32.766
- Maybe ride a pony?
- Um, I don't like ponies.

17:33.223 --> 17:34.721
Every little girl likes ponies.

17:34.722 --> 17:37.346
Uh, well, maybe not every little girl.

17:41.958 --> 17:42.773
You know what?

17:42.774 --> 17:46.510
Olivia has a lot of homework.
Right, O.?

17:46.635 --> 17:49.451
Yeah. I have a huge math test
to study for.

17:49.452 --> 17:51.867
Yeah, that's a... that's a big test.

17:52.366 --> 17:54.818
Yeah. May I please be
excused from the table?

17:54.819 --> 17:55.938
Of course.

18:01.378 --> 18:03.626
You know, I got all A's in math.
Maybe I should go and help...

18:03.627 --> 18:05.176
Bertha, go to the movies.

18:05.177 --> 18:05.936
You know, spend time with Scotty.

18:05.937 --> 18:08.731
- Enjoy your vacation.
- I think what Kevin means is...

18:09.222 --> 18:10.565
You need to stop trying so hard.

18:10.566 --> 18:11.537
You're overwhelming her.

18:11.538 --> 18:12.254
Well, excuse me

18:12.255 --> 18:14.615
for trying to spend time
with my only grandchild,

18:14.616 --> 18:16.857
- who lives a million miles away.
- That's not what I mean.

18:16.858 --> 18:19.073
I had to invite myself to
even come and meet her.

18:19.074 --> 18:20.113
You know how that makes me feel?

18:20.114 --> 18:23.461
We were gonna invite you once
the adoption was finalized.

18:23.462 --> 18:25.255
When did Nora meet her?

18:28.406 --> 18:29.446
I'm sorry.

18:30.021 --> 18:31.492
I think I've lost my appetite.

18:47.013 --> 18:49.026
Justin, are you... you okay?

18:50.088 --> 18:50.953
Yeah, yeah.

18:50.954 --> 18:53.700
Um... yeah, start on the dresser.

18:53.854 --> 18:55.135
I'll start over here.

18:57.332 --> 18:59.425
You know what? Can we just...
can we talk about something?

18:59.426 --> 19:01.569
Um, how... how are your paintings going?

19:01.941 --> 19:03.092
Good. It's going good.

19:03.868 --> 19:05.893
Come on, Luc. Just work with me.

19:05.894 --> 19:07.271
Talk about something else.

19:07.718 --> 19:08.838
Okay.

19:10.026 --> 19:12.171
Well, we are planning our wedding.

19:13.002 --> 19:13.786
Well, I am.

19:13.787 --> 19:15.869
Your sister, she wants
me to plan everything,

19:15.870 --> 19:17.614
but everything I plan, she hates.

19:18.298 --> 19:20.772
I-I guess I'm... I have
terrible taste or something.

19:20.773 --> 19:21.771
I don't know.

19:21.772 --> 19:22.989
Oh, my God.

19:23.022 --> 19:25.535
What? What is it?

19:26.367 --> 19:28.094
I think this is my grandfather.

19:32.082 --> 19:33.459
He looks just like you.

19:34.380 --> 19:36.572
Yeah, I never met him.
He died before I was born.

19:37.975 --> 19:39.063
I'm sorry.

19:39.174 --> 19:40.502
I guess she never got over him.

19:42.609 --> 19:43.637
Um...

19:44.312 --> 19:45.542
What should I do with this?

19:46.913 --> 19:47.986
What's this?

19:48.167 --> 19:49.787
A letter to Saul.

19:52.962 --> 19:53.894
Hi.

19:53.895 --> 19:54.998
Hey.

19:56.013 --> 19:57.142
How's she doing?

19:57.143 --> 19:59.368
Oh, the woman's a whirling dervish.

19:59.533 --> 20:00.877
She hasn't stopped planning the funeral

20:00.900 --> 20:02.604
since the moment she got
the call yesterday.

20:02.605 --> 20:03.946
Where is she? She, uh, she asked me

20:03.947 --> 20:06.877
to pick up the programs she
designed for the service.

20:06.878 --> 20:09.714
- She's looking at gravestones 
with Saul. - Oh.

20:09.715 --> 20:11.061
He didn't want to go.

20:11.703 --> 20:12.358
Jewish tradition

20:12.359 --> 20:14.873
doesn't have you place
the thing for a year.

20:15.824 --> 20:17.594
Well, at least they're doing it together.

20:17.595 --> 20:19.070
I guess that's important.

20:19.071 --> 20:20.694
Yeah, so is taking a breath.

20:22.208 --> 20:23.882
Saul took it pretty hard.

20:24.042 --> 20:24.132
Yeah?

20:24.133 --> 20:25.957
Your mom's just powering through,

20:25.958 --> 20:28.668
knocking off one task after the next.

20:28.823 --> 20:30.282
Yeah, that's her m.o.

20:30.283 --> 20:31.199
Yeah.

20:32.051 --> 20:33.137
How are you doing?

20:33.240 --> 20:34.905
Me? Oh, I'm fine.

20:35.229 --> 20:37.360
Ida and I were not close.

20:37.508 --> 20:39.555
I'm beginning to see a pattern here.

20:39.857 --> 20:41.650
Yeah. She wasn't the easiest
woman in the world.

20:41.651 --> 20:44.545
Well, I think Nora is trying
to make up for bad times.

20:45.028 --> 20:47.974
She's, uh, got quite a send-off planned.

20:49.809 --> 20:51.660
What is it about weddings and funerals

20:51.661 --> 20:54.590
that makes us all want to
put on such a big show?

20:56.487 --> 20:58.035
We're planning our wedding.

20:58.422 --> 21:00.982
Or Benoit of Beverly Hills is.

21:02.591 --> 21:03.580
You know, it's my second marriage.

21:03.581 --> 21:05.169
To be honest with you,

21:05.420 --> 21:06.622
I'd be happy at the courthouse.

21:06.623 --> 21:08.483
My second marriage was in Vegas.

21:08.484 --> 21:11.661
- It's the courthouse, but with cocktails.
- That sounds like fun.

21:11.662 --> 21:13.840
- If only the marriage was. 
- Oh, really?

21:13.841 --> 21:16.271
- Oh, please. 
- Okay, I won't ask.

21:18.647 --> 21:20.038
Are you taking off?

21:20.150 --> 21:21.161
Yeah.

21:21.474 --> 21:22.738
I think it's time for me to go.

21:22.739 --> 21:26.344
Brody, you can't just show
up here, drop your dog off,

21:26.345 --> 21:27.798
come back, and then leave,

21:27.799 --> 21:29.554
and pretend that nothing is happening.

21:29.555 --> 21:30.844
I think it's best if I just

21:30.845 --> 21:34.219
- get out of her hair.
- All right, listen to me.

21:34.220 --> 21:36.597
She may not be able to express this,

21:36.598 --> 21:37.601
but she needs you.

21:37.602 --> 21:39.308
Her mom just died.

21:41.628 --> 21:42.546
Fine, leave if you want,

21:42.547 --> 21:44.300
but don't pretend 
you're doing it for her.

21:44.301 --> 21:49.240
Sarah, I'm telling you, 
I don't know how to help her.

21:50.074 --> 21:51.316
Then figure it out.

22:10.490 --> 22:11.432
Wow.

22:12.280 --> 22:15.030
I barely even recognize her
looking like that... happy.

22:15.031 --> 22:16.146
Well, by the time we met her,

22:16.147 --> 22:18.838
- she really didn't have much
to be happy about. - No.

22:19.028 --> 22:22.038
- Here. - Oh, come on. Seriously?
We're... we're not even religious.

22:22.039 --> 22:24.606
Grandma was, so everyone
here is gonna wear one.

22:26.066 --> 22:27.719
I gave that letter to Saul.

22:28.243 --> 22:29.748
I think he's scared to open it.

22:29.749 --> 22:31.237
You find anything else in that room?

22:31.238 --> 22:35.308
No, not much.
Just a, uh, an old picture of grandpa.

22:35.309 --> 22:36.563
Grandpa Bernie?

22:36.564 --> 22:38.682
I didn't think they were
exactly the perfect couple.

22:39.554 --> 22:42.058
Well, they weren't, but she
never found anyone else.

22:42.499 --> 22:44.769
She had plenty of time
to find someone else.

22:48.258 --> 22:49.366
You know what, Kevin?

22:49.582 --> 22:50.859
Not everyone's as lucky as you are.

22:50.860 --> 22:52.654
I mean, if you hadn't met
Scotty, you'd probably still be

22:52.655 --> 22:53.327
some corporate lawyer,

22:53.328 --> 22:55.149
hooking up with a different
guy every night.

22:55.150 --> 22:57.305
Wow. Is that what you think of me?

22:59.841 --> 23:03.003
Look, all I'm saying is, 
I know what she went through.

23:03.383 --> 23:04.455
All right? When my marriage ended,

23:04.456 --> 23:07.690
- it felt like my life stopped.
- You're nothing like Ida.

23:07.691 --> 23:09.244
How do you know?
I'm about to be 30 years old,

23:09.245 --> 23:10.564
and I'm a single divorcee,

23:10.565 --> 23:11.926
- Kevin. 
- Yeah, and look what you've achieved.

23:11.927 --> 23:14.435
You served your country three
times, you beat addiction,

23:14.436 --> 23:15.164
you save lives for a living.

23:15.165 --> 23:16.528
Kevin, I don't care what I've achieved.

23:16.529 --> 23:19.371
I'm alone, just like grandma.

23:19.386 --> 23:20.904
And she ended up in a-a sad empty room

23:20.905 --> 23:22.537
with an old photograph.

23:24.303 --> 23:26.275
Not everyone gets the life they want.

23:31.406 --> 23:32.757
Welcome. Thank you for coming.

23:32.758 --> 23:34.057
Of course, dear.

23:35.568 --> 23:38.479
You're still here. I'm very glad.

23:38.480 --> 23:40.419
I came to pay my respects.

23:41.183 --> 23:43.210
Why did mom book the big room?

23:43.211 --> 23:45.458
- There's hardly anyone here? 
- Ask your mom.

23:45.462 --> 23:47.707
- Hello. - Oh, you must be
the lucky French guy.

23:47.708 --> 23:48.371
Mm-hmm. Nice to meet you.

23:48.372 --> 23:52.313
- How's the wedding going?
- Well, right now we're stuck

23:52.314 --> 23:53.818
somewhere between the royal wedding

23:53.819 --> 23:55.110
- and Vegas, baby. 
- Ooh.

23:55.111 --> 23:58.129
Vegas? That's new. 
Now you want to elope?

23:58.467 --> 24:00.359
- No, I was kidding. 
- Yeah,

24:00.360 --> 24:01.954
you've been kidding quite
a bit about this wedding.

24:01.955 --> 24:04.114
- Luc. 
- You skipped Benoit's meeting.

24:04.115 --> 24:05.469
You mock everything I bring home.

24:05.470 --> 24:07.109
No, I only mocked the swan.

24:07.110 --> 24:09.763
Guys, maybe we should take our seats.

24:12.186 --> 24:15.203
- Luc. - You know what?
I don't want to talk about this now.

24:15.204 --> 24:17.101
Well, I don't want to go
into a funeral angry.

24:17.102 --> 24:19.676
And I don't want you to go
into a wedding unhappy.

24:19.866 --> 24:21.468
Do you even want to get married?

24:21.469 --> 24:23.380
Luc, that is ridiculous.

24:24.095 --> 24:25.671
I'm sorry if I've been cracking jokes,

24:25.672 --> 24:28.036
but I don't care about a big wedding.

24:28.037 --> 24:29.350
It's my second marriage.

24:29.351 --> 24:31.680
I don't want to put on
some overpriced dress

24:31.681 --> 24:33.254
and pretend I'm a princess.

24:33.255 --> 24:34.957
It doesn't mean anything.

24:35.237 --> 24:35.746
Like this.

24:35.747 --> 24:37.351
You think a big send-off's

24:37.352 --> 24:39.450
gonna change how any of us 
felt about Ida?

24:39.451 --> 24:41.047
Sarah, maybe it doesn't
mean anything to you,

24:41.048 --> 24:42.941
but this is my first wedding.

24:43.154 --> 24:45.027
This will be my only marriage.

24:45.028 --> 24:48.012
I'm not trying to change how
I feel about you, Sarah.

24:48.650 --> 24:50.503
I'm just trying to celebrate it.

25:03.131 --> 25:04.094
Saul.

25:05.254 --> 25:06.712
To the cemetery after.

25:06.713 --> 25:08.083
I think they're ready to start.

25:09.335 --> 25:10.433
Thanks, Scotty.

25:15.965 --> 25:17.283
What's the letter say?

25:18.721 --> 25:19.741
I don't know.

25:20.118 --> 25:21.400
Well, don't you want to read it?

25:22.598 --> 25:24.310
No, Scotty. I don't want to read it.

25:26.594 --> 25:27.866
My mother told me a while ago

25:27.867 --> 25:30.105
that she wanted to write me about...

25:32.218 --> 25:33.855
She couldn't even say it out loud.

25:34.595 --> 25:35.892
Neither of us could.

25:37.044 --> 25:38.657
So she finally gets to say...

25:39.919 --> 25:41.250
What she wanted to say...

25:44.967 --> 25:46.905
That she's ashamed of me for being gay.

25:48.104 --> 25:49.688
And I don't want to read it.

25:53.127 --> 25:54.538
Come on. Let's go inside.

25:58.820 --> 26:00.345
Today, of course,

26:01.032 --> 26:02.581
is a celebration

26:02.814 --> 26:04.869
of the life of Ida Holden,

26:05.233 --> 26:07.333
beloved mother and grandmother.

26:08.536 --> 26:12.220
Her family would like to share
some of their memories now.

26:12.897 --> 26:13.839
Please.

26:38.976 --> 26:40.160
Hello, everyone.

26:40.161 --> 26:41.902
Thank you so much for coming.

26:44.853 --> 26:46.248
I'm Nora Walker.

26:46.726 --> 26:49.405
Ida Holden was my mother.

26:52.286 --> 26:53.840
My mother...

26:59.802 --> 27:01.994
My mother was...

27:09.339 --> 27:10.625
The truth is...

27:11.141 --> 27:14.028
I can accept the things that she was.

27:15.003 --> 27:16.436
It's the things...

27:16.918 --> 27:20.947
It's the things she wasn't
that breaks my heart.

27:21.798 --> 27:22.947
I, uh...

27:26.790 --> 27:27.769
I can't do this.

27:27.770 --> 27:30.290
I have nothing to say. 
I can't do this.

27:31.301 --> 27:32.205
I can't do this.

27:32.206 --> 27:34.907
Nora, come on. Let's go home.

27:35.871 --> 27:36.887
It's okay.

27:39.736 --> 27:40.722
I'm sorry.

27:42.339 --> 27:44.086
I have nothing to say.

27:46.507 --> 27:47.843
I have nothing to say.

27:59.007 --> 27:59.913
Hey.

28:02.516 --> 28:03.447
Thank you.

28:09.914 --> 28:11.117
What is that?

28:11.118 --> 28:11.991
Bourbon.

28:11.992 --> 28:14.424
Oh. I thought I asked for tea.

28:14.425 --> 28:16.877
You looked like you needed
something a little stronger.

28:20.274 --> 28:22.360
Thanks for driving me home, Brody.

28:23.194 --> 28:26.004
I just didn't feel like talking to anyone.

28:26.005 --> 28:28.841
Well, I don't know why.
I thought you were fantastic.

28:29.986 --> 28:32.120
For once, you weren't perfect.

28:32.444 --> 28:34.507
Well, great.

28:34.839 --> 28:35.869
Thanks.

28:39.012 --> 28:39.896
Brody.

28:46.685 --> 28:47.995
I'd like to say something to you.

28:47.996 --> 28:50.888
- Am I gonna need my own mug of bourbon?
- No, just...

28:51.643 --> 28:52.573
- Huh?
- Listen.

28:57.303 --> 29:00.601
I did try to live a good life.

29:00.602 --> 29:02.778
I tried to make this house a home.

29:03.625 --> 29:05.470
And in many ways, I succeeded,

29:05.471 --> 29:07.009
and in many ways, I failed.

29:07.010 --> 29:08.195
You don't have to do this.

29:08.196 --> 29:10.889
No. My marriage was a failure.

29:10.890 --> 29:14.165
It was built on lie after lie,

29:14.166 --> 29:19.056
and... I never wanted to see it.

29:19.882 --> 29:22.184
I tried so hard to just look away.

29:23.554 --> 29:24.534
When you...

29:25.985 --> 29:27.586
Showed up on my doorstep

29:27.587 --> 29:29.182
40 years later,

29:30.586 --> 29:33.688
it was deeply upsetting...

29:35.985 --> 29:37.042
Because...

29:41.241 --> 29:42.656
I remembered.

29:45.880 --> 29:47.833
I had a choice back then.

29:50.519 --> 29:51.470
You.

29:53.189 --> 29:55.562
And I never told you how I felt...

29:56.659 --> 29:58.817
Because I didn't think it was right.

30:00.499 --> 30:04.755
And now I am the way I am,
and you are the way you are,

30:04.756 --> 30:07.387
and so just keep going, Brody.

30:07.388 --> 30:11.163
Get back into that trusty old R.V.

30:11.164 --> 30:13.214
And... never look back.

30:13.215 --> 30:14.605
I got fired.

30:16.791 --> 30:17.294
What?

30:17.295 --> 30:21.003
The game ball I gave you?
That was my last one.

30:23.133 --> 30:25.021
Yeah, I...

30:26.475 --> 30:28.218
I benched our star player

30:28.219 --> 30:30.608
after I caught him taking steroids.

30:31.805 --> 30:35.077
And after I got the old boot,
I headed straight here.

30:37.677 --> 30:40.643
And I didn't come back 
just to get my dog.

30:42.522 --> 30:44.451
I came back to get you..

30:46.492 --> 30:48.259
Future's wide open...

30:49.719 --> 30:51.136
For both of us.

30:52.498 --> 30:53.731
To do what?

30:54.156 --> 30:55.850
Just close our eyes...

30:56.575 --> 30:57.901
And jump.

31:22.339 --> 31:23.809
Hi, mom. How's Olivia?

31:23.810 --> 31:25.036
Sleeping like an angel.

31:25.037 --> 31:27.888
Oh, great. Oh, thank you
so much for watching her.

31:27.889 --> 31:28.938
I don't think she was quite ready

31:28.939 --> 31:31.961
for the Walker grief parade,
and she never met the woman.

31:31.962 --> 31:33.077
Seems like there's a lot of family

31:33.078 --> 31:34.457
- you've kept away from her. 
- That's enough.

31:34.458 --> 31:36.889
I told you, we just got custody.

31:37.324 --> 31:39.489
I can't listen to this.
I'm going downstairs.

31:43.639 --> 31:44.582
Well...

31:45.768 --> 31:48.350
I think I'll probably be 
leaving tomorrow.

31:48.920 --> 31:49.991
No, you don't have to do that.

31:49.992 --> 31:51.524
It's pretty clear I do.

31:53.400 --> 31:55.934
No, you just need to learn to zip it.

31:56.281 --> 31:57.282
Excuse me?

31:57.331 --> 32:00.687
Bertha, Olivia is our child,
and we're gonna make mistakes,

32:00.688 --> 32:02.953
but you have to let us make them.

32:04.374 --> 32:06.710
Y-you know, Scotty and I,

32:06.938 --> 32:08.615
it has never worked with us.

32:08.616 --> 32:11.482
It's like everything I say 
comes out wrong.

32:11.483 --> 32:13.073
Well, then say something else,

32:13.492 --> 32:15.428
because he wants you guys
to have a good relationship

32:15.429 --> 32:17.687
- as much as you do. 
- When I came here,

32:18.516 --> 32:21.990
I think I felt, if I could
be the perfect grandmother,

32:22.134 --> 32:24.031
somehow I could heal Scotty and me.

32:24.032 --> 32:25.758
It's idiotic, I know.

32:28.794 --> 32:29.759
Bertha...

32:30.640 --> 32:32.548
I buried my grandmother today.

32:33.224 --> 32:36.100
She doesn't have the chance to
fix what was wrong with us,

32:36.101 --> 32:37.771
much less her own children.

32:38.726 --> 32:39.961
You still do.

32:43.312 --> 32:44.329
Oh.

32:53.506 --> 32:55.559
You look like you could use a refill.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.280
I don't want to fight anymore.

33:03.392 --> 33:04.533
Me, neither.

33:05.751 --> 33:07.783
Look, you can wear 
whatever you want...

33:07.784 --> 33:09.556
a black dress, a white dress.

33:09.567 --> 33:11.070
One of Kitty's pantsuit.

33:11.071 --> 33:11.702
I don't care.

33:11.703 --> 33:13.477
Why do I feel like I'd be robbing you

33:13.478 --> 33:15.297
of some childhood dream?

33:16.868 --> 33:19.049
There's a picture in Paige's room

33:19.993 --> 33:21.302
of you at your first wedding.

33:21.303 --> 33:24.216
And, uh... you were glowing.

33:24.749 --> 33:25.992
You looked perfect.

33:28.225 --> 33:29.974
I guess I was trying to compete.

33:30.076 --> 33:32.350
Oh, God, Luc. 
You don't have to compete.

33:32.964 --> 33:34.879
My wedding was far from perfect.

33:35.377 --> 33:36.800
But more importantly...

33:37.984 --> 33:40.227
My marriage was far from perfect.

33:40.856 --> 33:43.750
You've got that beat, and we
haven't even said "I do."

33:47.165 --> 33:48.966
So what are we gonna do 
about the wedding?

33:51.121 --> 33:53.011
I know what we're not gonna do...

33:53.948 --> 33:55.492
princess dresses,

33:55.558 --> 33:58.143
bridesmaids in matching taffeta,

33:59.215 --> 34:00.159
and live animals.

34:00.160 --> 34:01.872
Okay. Agreed.

34:02.591 --> 34:03.573
But...

34:05.261 --> 34:07.605
The guest list is 200...

34:07.606 --> 34:09.091
- What? 
- And I'm not negotiating.

34:09.092 --> 34:10.402
- 100. 
- 150.

34:10.402 --> 34:11.670
- Deal. 
- Done.

34:13.179 --> 34:14.853
- No more demands? 
- Just one.

34:14.998 --> 34:16.808
- Which one? 
- Fire Benoit.

34:16.809 --> 34:18.909
- Done. 
- Deal.

34:21.255 --> 34:22.581
We need another case of red.

34:22.583 --> 34:24.612
Oh, I'm glad to see things
finally getting back to normal

34:24.614 --> 34:27.789
- with the Walkers. - Well the Irish
drown their sorrows in whiskey.

34:27.790 --> 34:30.293
The Walkers prefer a full-bodied cab.

34:30.295 --> 34:31.955
Well, it's not just our family, you know?

34:31.956 --> 34:34.645
Those old ladies out there?
They're doing just fine.

34:34.646 --> 34:37.119
What about you, Saul?
How many sheets to the wind

34:37.120 --> 34:39.246
do you need to be before
you read that letter?

34:39.735 --> 34:41.382
I don't know. At least a few.

34:42.320 --> 34:44.300
You know, the longer you
wait, the harder it gets.

34:44.496 --> 34:47.224
Why don't you just rip it off,
like a band-aid?

34:51.279 --> 34:53.042
Okay. Here we go.

34:53.801 --> 34:54.681
Read it, Scotty.

34:54.683 --> 34:55.135
Me?

34:55.136 --> 34:57.822
Yeah. I don't have my glasses.
Just read it, please.

34:57.980 --> 34:58.990
Okay.

35:01.779 --> 35:03.171
"My dear Saul,

35:04.000 --> 35:06.417
"it breaks my heart to write this letter.

35:07.230 --> 35:08.931
"I've known since you were a young man

35:08.932 --> 35:10.785
that you've been keeping a secret."

35:10.786 --> 35:12.618
Okay. Okay. All right. Give it to me.

35:12.619 --> 35:15.328
I'll read it. I don't need my glasses.

35:15.797 --> 35:16.795
Maybe.

35:18.073 --> 35:20.285
Okay. "...Keeping a secret.

35:20.848 --> 35:22.585
"But I know there was a reason.

35:22.586 --> 35:23.039
"At first,

35:23.040 --> 35:25.696
you probably didn't even want
to admit it to yourself."

35:25.729 --> 35:26.805
Good, mom.

35:27.805 --> 35:31.090
"And I never thought that I
could be the one to ask you.

35:32.936 --> 35:36.943
"So now I cnn only hope that
you've had a beautiful life

35:37.904 --> 35:39.144
"and someone to share it with

35:39.145 --> 35:41.845
even if you didn't share
that part of it with me."

35:47.837 --> 35:49.061
"You deserve"...

35:52.088 --> 35:54.167
"All the happiness in the world"...

35:58.180 --> 35:59.433
"My Saul."

36:03.848 --> 36:05.682
"I trust you found it.

36:06.601 --> 36:10.513
Love... mother."

36:19.141 --> 36:20.799
I told you I shouldn't read it.

36:22.129 --> 36:23.375
That was beautiful, Saul.

36:23.376 --> 36:24.959
What was beautiful?

36:25.731 --> 36:27.863
Nothing she wanted for me happened.

36:27.989 --> 36:30.796
I have spent all of my life alone.

36:35.279 --> 36:36.393
It's funny.

36:36.420 --> 36:38.152
The only thing I was able
to hide from my mother

36:38.153 --> 36:39.155
was my loneliness.

36:39.156 --> 36:42.309
But you're not. You're not alone.

36:44.074 --> 36:45.693
I'm sorry it's too late
for you to tell her that,

36:45.694 --> 36:48.524
but it's not too late 
for you and Jonathan.

36:58.763 --> 36:58.913
Hey.

36:58.914 --> 37:00.346
Are you coming inside?

37:00.347 --> 37:02.814
Uh, yeah, yeah. In a... in a minute.

37:03.961 --> 37:07.891
Do you really think I got
here because of luck?

37:07.892 --> 37:10.168
No, I do not. 
And I apologize for saying that.

37:10.169 --> 37:12.677
Thank you, 
because I've worked very hard

37:12.678 --> 37:15.929
to be good enough 
for someone like Scotty.

37:16.387 --> 37:18.242
And you know who gave
me the hope to do that?

37:18.243 --> 37:21.249
Oh, God, Kevin.
Please, please do not say me.

37:21.250 --> 37:22.379
All right? 
You guys do this all the time.

37:22.380 --> 37:25.309
It's insulting.
It's, "Justin was such a screw-up.

37:25.310 --> 37:26.110
- "Look how far he was able"... 
- Okay,

37:26.111 --> 37:28.920
let me put it like this.
You're right. Life isn't fair.

37:28.921 --> 37:31.527
Sometimes good people live sad lives.

37:31.814 --> 37:33.298
You're not gonna be 
one of them, okay?

37:33.299 --> 37:34.748
Because any kid who writes a

37:34.749 --> 37:36.542
- list like this isn't gonna... 
- Give me that list.

37:36.543 --> 37:37.628
No. No. Kevin, give me the list.
It's my list.

37:37.629 --> 37:38.925
- No, no, listen. Listen.
- Kevin, it's my l... it's my list.

37:38.926 --> 37:43.074
I know. Listen to this.
"Ride a wave on bells beach.

37:43.075 --> 37:45.213
Go streaking. Have a threesome."

37:45.674 --> 37:47.331
Well, you can check one
of those off the list.

37:47.332 --> 37:49.276
- How big was the wave? 
- Not big enough.

37:50.772 --> 37:52.363
You're a dreamer, Justin.

37:52.402 --> 37:53.742
And you still are.

37:54.531 --> 37:56.892
Yeah, most of this list
is impossible, but...

37:57.543 --> 38:00.535
You have more determination
than anyone I know.

38:00.895 --> 38:03.210
And luck didn't get you here. You did.

38:03.211 --> 38:04.747
So write another list.

38:04.880 --> 38:05.848
Come on.

38:08.547 --> 38:11.279
"Dye my hair"? What was I thinking?

38:11.280 --> 38:13.242
It was the '90s. 
Bleached blonde was in.

38:28.074 --> 38:29.083
We did what? What?

38:29.771 --> 38:30.376
You told him so many incredible

38:30.377 --> 38:32.085
- things about her...
- Oh, no, no. Well, I just...

38:32.086 --> 38:32.997
I can't believe that everyone
else is gone but us.

38:32.998 --> 38:34.945
Who? Who are you talking about?

38:35.279 --> 38:36.977
Oh, come on, mom. They're all pretty old.

38:36.978 --> 38:39.526
I think they had to get home
to the retirement village

38:39.527 --> 38:42.172
- before lockdown. 
- Is the wedding still on?

38:42.173 --> 38:42.922
- Oh, yes, yes. 
- Oh, yeah.

38:42.923 --> 38:45.132
- It's gonna be quite a party.
- Mm-hmm. But no swans.

38:45.133 --> 38:46.913
- No, no swans. - Great.
Oh, what are you gonna do about the cake?

38:46.914 --> 38:48.500
- You going with the marzipan? 
- Listen to him.

38:48.501 --> 38:50.099
Kevin, you should plan our wedding.

38:50.100 --> 38:51.339
I'd love to.

38:52.034 --> 38:53.697
- Are you serious? 
- Yeah.

38:56.178 --> 38:56.584
You're on.

38:56.585 --> 38:58.120
- Great. 
- You know what?

38:58.121 --> 39:01.280
I happen to know a-a
florist who is available.

39:01.472 --> 39:02.397
Is she short?

39:02.398 --> 39:04.382
She's short and older, 
but she works hard.

39:04.383 --> 39:07.287
- Wait, wait, whoa, whoa.
Who's doing the bachelor party? - We are.

39:07.288 --> 39:09.266
- No, excuse me. We are. 
- Us?

39:09.434 --> 39:11.738
- Yeah, we are, in Palm Springs. 
- What?

39:11.739 --> 39:14.584
- Yes, we're gonna buy a house there. 
- We are?

39:15.325 --> 39:16.688
That would be incredible.

39:16.689 --> 39:17.683
That would be brilliant.

39:17.684 --> 39:20.781
- Brody could drive you all down 
in his R.V.  - Oh, really?

39:21.540 --> 39:24.458
I mean, if... if he's around.
Are you gonna be around, Brody?

39:24.459 --> 39:26.435
I might be. That could happen.

39:26.563 --> 39:29.622
Actually, I'd like to make
a toast, uh, if I could.

39:29.830 --> 39:34.657
- Um, Ida never really liked me very much.
- I'll say.

39:35.288 --> 39:36.207
Hey. Oh. Sorry.

39:36.208 --> 39:37.922
She didn't think I was good
enough for her daughter.

39:37.923 --> 39:41.395
She was probably right, but,
uh, I have to say this...

39:41.396 --> 39:43.391
people do change.

39:43.392 --> 39:45.599
Hmm? I-I never thought I'd see the day

39:45.600 --> 39:47.924
where I'd be sitting around
this family's table...

39:48.236 --> 39:50.748
a family that Ida helped create.

39:51.253 --> 39:52.367
So, uh...

39:52.824 --> 39:54.583
Come on. Here's to Ida.

39:54.725 --> 39:55.741
To Ida.

39:57.781 --> 39:59.519
Hmm. Actually, now it's my turn.

40:00.969 --> 40:01.994
Mother...

40:02.393 --> 40:05.105
- Mother, I'd like you to meet
the love of my life... - What?

40:05.106 --> 40:06.943
- Jonathan. 
- Aww.

40:07.295 --> 40:08.439
Sweetheart.

40:08.762 --> 40:10.008
Oh. Never say never.

40:10.009 --> 40:12.366
Okay, wait, wait. It's my turn.

40:13.571 --> 40:16.152
- Guys, I'm turning 30 in less
than 45 minutes. - Your birthday!

40:16.153 --> 40:18.218
- Oh, my God! I completely forgot.
- Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

40:18.219 --> 40:20.581
I don't want anything
from anyone, but there is

40:20.582 --> 40:23.433
something that I have to
do by the time it's 12:00,

40:23.435 --> 40:24.584
which is soon.

40:25.627 --> 40:28.649
My lovely brother Kevin, um,
informed me

40:28.650 --> 40:30.313
that I had made a list many, 
many years ago

40:30.314 --> 40:32.487
of things that I wanted
to accomplish by now,

40:32.488 --> 40:35.514
and... at the top of the list is,

40:35.515 --> 40:37.755
"tell mom what I really think of her."

40:38.028 --> 40:40.196
The first thing I want to
say is, I'm really pissed

40:40.197 --> 40:42.759
- you took my discman. 
- What?

40:43.549 --> 40:46.739
Mom... I love you.

40:47.194 --> 40:49.219
And we all do, and you
did a great job today.

40:49.611 --> 40:51.285
