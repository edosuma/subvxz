01:04.949 --> 01:07.218
<i>I know what you are.</i>

01:07.285 --> 01:10.420
<i>You're not one of us.</i>

01:10.487 --> 01:11.821
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

01:11.889 --> 01:14.125
<i>I look like everyone else.</i>

01:14.191 --> 01:16.426
<i>No. I saw your files.</i>

01:16.493 --> 01:18.195
<i>You're... you're...</i>

01:18.262 --> 01:19.829
<i>An alien?</i>

01:39.216 --> 01:40.717
Aliens are scary.

01:40.784 --> 01:42.420
Aren't you glad
they're not real?

01:46.290 --> 01:47.691
Mom!

01:48.758 --> 01:50.061
Thanks
for calling, Deb.

01:50.127 --> 01:53.297
I mean, it wasn't
even that scary.

01:53.364 --> 01:54.999
He just gets
a little jittery.

02:02.505 --> 02:06.543
So that movie
really bothered you, huh?

02:12.682 --> 02:14.852
You didn't say anything,
did you?

02:25.129 --> 02:27.597
It's been days!
It's not healthy.

02:27.664 --> 02:29.400
It's a weak prescription.

02:29.467 --> 02:31.634
Anyway, you try
taking them away.

02:31.701 --> 02:36.140
Now he spends every waking minute,
trying to get that thing to work.

02:36.207 --> 02:38.242
Maybe
we shouldn't have told him.

02:38.309 --> 02:40.911
He lifted a
tractor with one finger, Martha.

02:40.978 --> 02:43.580
He was gonna figure it out.

02:43.646 --> 02:47.418
I don't want him
to feel different.

02:47.485 --> 02:51.688
He is different.
And it scares him, for good reason.

02:51.755 --> 02:54.158
Whoever put him in that ship
had no idea or care

02:54.225 --> 02:57.461
for how dangerous a world
they were sending him to.

02:57.527 --> 03:00.331
The more he knows, the more he can protect himself

03:00.398 --> 03:01.531
and us.

03:04.768 --> 03:07.771
We're supposed
to protect him, Jonathan.

03:07.837 --> 03:09.240
Not the other way around.

03:37.168 --> 03:40.404
<i>Right over left.</i>

03:40.471 --> 03:43.773
- <i>Now, right over...</i>
- <i>No! Left over right!</i>

03:43.840 --> 03:45.742
<i>The image is flipped
on this thing.</i>

03:45.809 --> 03:47.610
<i>What? No, it isn't.</i>

03:47.677 --> 03:49.746
It's okay. I can manage.

03:49.813 --> 03:51.282
You both worry too much.

03:52.383 --> 03:54.051
<i>Shouldn't we?</i>

03:54.118 --> 03:56.887
I can't read
that, Mom. It's...

03:56.954 --> 03:59.957
You have to pull back
from the...

04:00.024 --> 04:03.827
<i>"Flying Man of Metropolis,
Spotted Over South Side."</i>

04:03.894 --> 04:06.263
<i>That's the third story
in two months.</i>

04:06.330 --> 04:08.698
<i>Metropolis
isn't Smallville.</i>

04:08.765 --> 04:10.334
There are powerful
people there,

04:10.401 --> 04:12.669
who would love nothing more
than to get their hands on...

04:13.803 --> 04:16.907
You. Please, be careful.

04:17.475 --> 04:20.277
I will. I am.

04:20.344 --> 04:23.080
Now, I really do have to get to work.
Everyone's counting on me.

04:23.147 --> 04:25.483
I'm a big part of the team
covering today's launch.

04:25.549 --> 04:27.485
<i>Launch? Of what?</i>

04:27.551 --> 04:29.686
You'll read about it tomorrow in
<i>the Daily Planet.</i> I love you. Bye.

04:59.049 --> 05:01.118
Coffee boy! Over here.

05:03.888 --> 05:05.722
Here yo go, Mr. Troupe.

05:05.788 --> 05:07.925
Large skinny vanilla latte. No whip.
And I hope you don't mind,

05:07.992 --> 05:12.196
I had them add a dash of cinnamon to
the grinds. It really wakes it up.

05:12.263 --> 05:15.933
Mmm. Now, you know you don't
have to call me Mr. Troupe.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.968
And uh, you don't actually
have to call me...

05:18.035 --> 05:19.970
Coffee boy,
get a move on!

05:20.037 --> 05:21.704
Excuse me.

05:21.771 --> 05:24.475
Mr. Luthor,
what can you tell us about S.T.A.R. Labs?

05:29.079 --> 05:31.916
Today, is a great day
for Metropolis.

05:32.650 --> 05:34.751
And indeed, the planet.

05:34.817 --> 05:37.955
With any luck, we'll soon have
answered the age-old question,

05:38.022 --> 05:40.991
"Are we alone in the universe?"

05:41.058 --> 05:43.494
The good people at S.T.A.R.
Labs are about to launch

05:43.561 --> 05:47.498
the most sophisticated,
orbital telescope the world has ever seen.

05:47.565 --> 05:50.733
And it's all happening
via a two-stage, liquid-fueled

05:50.800 --> 05:55.172
launch vehicle,
built by none other than LexCorp.

06:00.110 --> 06:02.012
I'll only be taking
one question.

06:02.079 --> 06:04.982
From the young woman
in the back. Hello, Lois.

06:08.252 --> 06:09.954
Lois Lane,
for those that don't know,

06:10.020 --> 06:12.890
is the recipient of the
Luthor Journalism Scholarship.

06:12.957 --> 06:14.992
Haven't heard from
you in months, Lois.

06:15.059 --> 06:16.560
Studies keeping you busy?

06:16.627 --> 06:18.862
I've definitely learned a lot.

06:18.929 --> 06:20.497
Like how you built
that rocket with funds

06:20.564 --> 06:23.234
you received from a rather
hefty government contract.

06:24.702 --> 06:28.072
This president knows a good
investment, when he sees it.

06:28.138 --> 06:30.574
Does he know fraud
when he sees it?

06:30.641 --> 06:32.209
Gross negligence.

06:33.644 --> 06:35.879
Not the question
I expected, Lois.

06:38.382 --> 06:40.150
<i>That's how business is done.</i>

06:40.217 --> 06:42.752
<i>I practically sat him
in the Oval Office myself.</i>

06:42.819 --> 06:45.723
<i>He owes me. More champagne?</i>

06:45.788 --> 06:48.359
<i>Legally, it's opaque.</i>

06:48.425 --> 06:50.427
<i>So you set up a ten million
dollar space program</i>

06:50.494 --> 06:53.931
<i>that the feds underwrite
to the tune of six billion...</i>

06:53.998 --> 06:55.966
<i>The rockets are junk, but...</i>

06:57.101 --> 06:59.136
"But who knows,
they might fly,

06:59.203 --> 07:01.838
and anyone moronic enough
to live close to a launch site

07:01.905 --> 07:05.075
deserves to be hit
by fiery debris."

07:05.876 --> 07:07.344
I have copies, Lex.

07:08.879 --> 07:11.315
Well, I hope you enjoyed
the champagne, at least?

07:14.718 --> 07:16.387
One at a time, please.

07:16.453 --> 07:17.554
One at a time.

07:24.328 --> 07:26.297
Looks like you
could use this more than me.

07:26.363 --> 07:30.034
Oh, you're a life saver.
Early shift.

07:32.303 --> 07:34.238
Mmm. Hmm.

07:34.305 --> 07:36.040
That cinnamon
really wakes it up.

07:36.106 --> 07:37.207
Yeah. I think so, too.

07:40.411 --> 07:43.147
Shouldn't you be part of this
feeding frenzy?

07:43.213 --> 07:47.718
No. Well, uh, yes.
But, no.

07:47.785 --> 07:49.787
Well, I'm glad
we cleared that up.

07:49.853 --> 07:53.823
Well, I mean, I'm not a
reporter, not yet, anyway.

07:53.891 --> 07:55.392
Just an intern.

07:55.459 --> 07:57.827
How does an intern
become a reporter?

07:57.895 --> 08:00.197
With a scoop like that.

08:00.264 --> 08:03.934
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

08:04.001 --> 08:05.235
<i>We have lift off!</i>

08:19.416 --> 08:22.486
That's nothing.

08:22.553 --> 08:24.855
I've seen stuff in there.

08:24.922 --> 08:27.491
Experiments. Bizarre weapons.

08:28.192 --> 08:29.993
Containment cells.

08:30.060 --> 08:32.663
All designed to neutralize
the kind of weird powers

08:32.730 --> 08:34.598
you read about these days.

08:34.665 --> 08:36.700
Super speed. Strength.

08:36.767 --> 08:39.203
All that alien stuff.

08:39.269 --> 08:41.271
It's like, we're preparing
for something.

08:42.139 --> 08:43.807
If you ask me,

08:43.874 --> 08:47.111
I'd say somebody already knows
we're not alone in the universe.

08:50.948 --> 08:52.549
Can you get me inside?

08:52.616 --> 08:53.650
Helluva scoop, huh?

08:53.717 --> 08:56.286
But no, uh...

08:56.954 --> 08:58.555
I gotta work.

08:58.622 --> 09:02.359
My kid, he's in first grade.
We got another on the way.

09:03.093 --> 09:04.628
What if my name came out?

09:05.529 --> 09:07.598
I protect my people.

09:07.664 --> 09:10.033
I think you're the one
that might need protecting.

09:11.802 --> 09:14.104
Two tours in Iraq.

09:14.171 --> 09:16.807
I know a shadow
when I see it.

09:16.875 --> 09:20.077
Someone's interested in you, kid.
I'd watch your back.

09:29.019 --> 09:30.921
Look! Up in the sky!

09:40.899 --> 09:42.366
Whoa! Hey, maybe we should...

09:47.070 --> 09:48.405
Damn.

09:53.744 --> 09:54.978
You gotta be kidding me.

11:17.761 --> 11:21.298
Eyes up here!
Everybody, come on.

11:21.365 --> 11:25.469
I know I don't say it very often, but I
am always, always, looking out for you!

11:25.536 --> 11:27.337
We're a team.

11:29.874 --> 11:33.710
That's why I'm showing you what
a real reporter looks like!

11:33.777 --> 11:36.813
Maybe knock some sense into
the more worthless of you.

11:36.881 --> 11:39.149
- Oh, Jesus!
- Oh, classic Perry!

11:39.216 --> 11:41.920
Anyway, meet the newest
addition to the team.

11:41.986 --> 11:46.056
The grad student who took
down a billionaire genius.

11:46.123 --> 11:48.592
An actual talent. Lois Lane.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.770
- A grad student? Are you kidding me with this?
- Welcome, kid.

11:59.836 --> 12:00.837
Welcome to the team.

12:03.307 --> 12:06.677
See, now they hate you.
That couldn't have gone better.

12:31.735 --> 12:33.303
Uh, Miss Lane.

12:33.370 --> 12:35.405
Don't worry,
it's under control.

12:40.243 --> 12:42.746
There. Lois, by the way.

12:42.813 --> 12:44.147
Just... Lois.

12:44.214 --> 12:46.283
Cool. Just Lois.

12:48.585 --> 12:49.820
And you are?

12:49.887 --> 12:52.155
Oh, I'm coffee... Uh, Clark.

12:52.222 --> 12:54.625
I'm Clark Kent. <i>Daily Planet.</i>

12:54.691 --> 12:56.259
No kidding.

12:56.326 --> 12:59.563
Right. Sorry. I'm just...
I was there at S.T.A.R. Labs.

12:59.630 --> 13:01.899
I saw what you did.
It was amazing.

13:01.966 --> 13:03.433
That creep had it coming.

13:05.268 --> 13:07.404
Can I just... how did you do it?

13:07.471 --> 13:09.439
I mean, I know, the champagne.

13:11.708 --> 13:14.678
It wasn't like that.
Trust me.

13:14.745 --> 13:18.749
People with that much power think
they wield it over everyone.

13:18.815 --> 13:21.351
If you can take that away
from them, for a moment,

13:21.418 --> 13:23.353
you can take it away for good.

13:23.420 --> 13:24.989
It's called a power move.

13:25.056 --> 13:28.492
And I don't want to brag,
but it's kind of my specialty.

13:29.593 --> 13:31.395
Well that, and paper jams.

13:31.461 --> 13:34.032
Any other questions?

13:34.098 --> 13:38.136
If you're gonna be a reporter, kid,
you gotta ask all the questions.

13:38.201 --> 13:40.671
It's just... what do you do now?

13:40.737 --> 13:43.407
You've already taken down the
most powerful man in the world.

13:45.275 --> 13:46.576
Have I?

13:48.146 --> 13:50.247
Have a nice weekend,
Coffee Boy!

13:53.650 --> 13:54.919
Uh, Lois, you left your...

14:10.200 --> 14:11.535
Hmm.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.174
All right.

14:16.239 --> 14:18.575
<i>Breaking news.
An unidentified object</i>

14:18.642 --> 14:22.046
<i>heading towards Earth
was detected by S.T.A.R. Labs.</i>

14:22.113 --> 14:23.547
<i>Stay tuned for updates.</i>

14:23.613 --> 14:25.282
Has anybody seen
this thing?

14:25.348 --> 14:26.683
Do we have a visual?

14:38.595 --> 14:40.363
You gotta figure out
what happened.

14:40.430 --> 14:41.832
- Does anyone know where it is?
- Hold on one second.

15:28.278 --> 15:29.579
Why are you here?

15:32.382 --> 15:34.718
Why are you here?

15:34.785 --> 15:35.987
Kryptonian!

15:37.354 --> 15:38.789
What did you say?

15:38.856 --> 15:42.759
'Course I never heard
of no flying Kryptonian!

15:42.826 --> 15:44.828
But, whatevs.

16:16.326 --> 16:19.329
Guess we're doing this
the fun way!

16:56.868 --> 17:01.371
Don't struggle now.
You'll just make 'em vengeful.

17:28.966 --> 17:31.401
This planet
is protected, alien.

17:35.273 --> 17:36.740
Alien?

17:36.806 --> 17:39.110
They ain't got mirrors
on this dump?

17:39.176 --> 17:43.214
You're as alien as they come
around here, Kryptonian.

17:43.281 --> 17:46.783
Kryptonian? I'm a Kryptonian.

17:50.420 --> 17:53.124
You're <i>the</i> Kryptonian.

17:53.190 --> 17:57.494
Last one in the universe
tucked away in Sector 2814.

17:57.560 --> 18:01.464
You got an awful big bounty on
that stupid looking head o' yers.

18:02.400 --> 18:04.235
You're here for me.

18:04.302 --> 18:09.173
So, I guess... I guess that means,
you have to bring me in alive,

18:09.240 --> 18:10.740
bounty hunter.

18:13.177 --> 18:14.844
Name's Lobo.

18:15.812 --> 18:16.746
And...

18:18.648 --> 18:19.816
Nah.

18:26.489 --> 18:29.060
Mess with the main man,

18:29.126 --> 18:30.460
and you get the...

18:35.433 --> 18:38.035
Well, frag the shit out of me.

18:49.512 --> 18:51.681
You sure you're from Krypton?

18:52.283 --> 18:53.884
I'm from Kansas.

18:53.951 --> 18:57.288
Well, something about Kansas
made you strong.

18:57.355 --> 18:58.621
Weird strong.

19:06.763 --> 19:09.166
I like it.

20:06.190 --> 20:08.426
<i>It appears the flying man
is headed towards the bay.</i>

20:08.492 --> 20:11.362
<i>Perhaps, he's had enough
and is in retreat.</i>

20:11.429 --> 20:14.865
<i>Perhaps, he's trying to move
the fight to safer ground.</i>

20:26.210 --> 20:27.777
They're coming here.

20:27.844 --> 20:30.014
Go! Go! Move!

21:13.257 --> 21:14.859
I wonder...

21:16.626 --> 21:18.195
can you see in the dark!

22:05.476 --> 22:06.410
Agh!

22:55.059 --> 22:55.993
Agh!

23:21.652 --> 23:22.886
Get back!

23:42.406 --> 23:44.642
Purty, ain't it?

23:44.708 --> 23:47.044
You know I'm not one
fer poetry,

23:47.111 --> 23:51.415
but seeing how it was Krypton
itself killed yer people,

23:51.482 --> 23:53.150
s'only right this ring,

23:53.217 --> 23:56.153
carved from the remains
of that doomed rock,

23:56.220 --> 23:59.390
should be the thing
to mess you up.

24:17.308 --> 24:18.542
Huh? Agh!

24:30.454 --> 24:32.856
- Oh! What is that thing?
- What in God's name...

24:32.923 --> 24:34.325
- Do you see that?
- Let's get outta here!

24:34.391 --> 24:36.560
Tell me you're rolling.
Roll tape! Roll tape!

24:36.627 --> 24:40.464
Well, how 'bout this?
A goddamn Martian.

25:54.705 --> 25:56.440
Look!

26:19.963 --> 26:23.200
You were right.
This was the fun way.

26:41.051 --> 26:43.053
Oh, my God,
it's incredible!

26:49.359 --> 26:52.129
Great Caesar's ghost!

26:52.196 --> 26:55.332
It's been days, people! Days!

26:55.399 --> 26:57.234
I may be the managing editor,

26:57.301 --> 27:00.137
but I'm also
a <i>Daily Planet</i> subscriber.

27:00.204 --> 27:02.339
I read the damn thing
every day.

27:02.406 --> 27:04.975
Hell, I read it
the night before every day

27:05.042 --> 27:06.543
and I still don't know

27:06.610 --> 27:10.447
Where are the aliens from?
What do they want with us?

27:10.514 --> 27:13.784
And what are their weaknesses,
if any?

27:13.852 --> 27:14.953
Chief, maybe if we...

27:15.018 --> 27:17.488
Are you talking
or am I talking?

27:18.088 --> 27:19.690
You're talking.

27:19.756 --> 27:23.293
Damn skippy! And, yes, Troupe,
we got a little carried away

27:23.360 --> 27:25.195
with coverage
of the Flying Man.

27:25.262 --> 27:27.966
The Superman.

27:28.031 --> 27:31.201
Write it all you want, Lois,
it's never gonna catch on.

27:31.268 --> 27:35.439
Listen up! The flying man
is no longer the story.

27:35.506 --> 27:37.474
I want aliens.

27:37.541 --> 27:39.978
Everybody stop
whatever you're doing

27:40.043 --> 27:43.146
and get me copy
about the aliens!

27:43.213 --> 27:46.216
Well that's it.
Get back to work.

27:51.154 --> 27:52.623
Speaking of the Superman,

27:52.689 --> 27:54.458
though I think
Perry's right by the way,

27:54.525 --> 27:56.026
it's never going to catch on.

27:56.093 --> 27:57.227
Didn't you have
an interview scheduled?

27:57.294 --> 27:59.931
Like five minutes ago?

27:59.998 --> 28:03.834
Oh, Clark.
So innocent.

28:03.902 --> 28:05.802
I'm not going to that.

28:05.870 --> 28:08.238
See, right now, the Superman is
waiting for me up there on the roof,

28:08.305 --> 28:11.009
getting more
and more impatient.

28:11.074 --> 28:13.477
Ah, it's a "power move."

28:13.544 --> 28:16.547
It's a power move.
Eventually, he'll give up

28:16.613 --> 28:19.017
and, if he's the egomaniac
I think he is,

28:19.082 --> 28:22.085
he will beg me to reschedule.

28:25.055 --> 28:26.925
And when you do...

28:26.991 --> 28:30.193
Big Brave Strong Man
will be putty in my hands.

28:30.260 --> 28:32.663
He'll answer anything.

28:32.729 --> 28:36.500
Where do you come from? Do you
report to some kind of leader?

28:39.570 --> 28:41.405
It sounds like
you think he's...

28:41.471 --> 28:44.976
Another alien?
He flies and can push rockets.

28:45.043 --> 28:47.244
Of course he is.

28:47.311 --> 28:51.582
But, uh, what if he denies it?

28:51.648 --> 28:53.684
Then he's fallen
right into my trap.

28:53.750 --> 28:55.786
See, by then, I'll have
gotten the real truth

28:55.853 --> 28:58.388
from my interview
with the loud, hairy one.

28:58.455 --> 29:00.691
Wait, you're interviewing Lobo?

29:00.757 --> 29:03.226
Isn't he locked up
at S.T.A.R. Labs?

29:03.293 --> 29:05.228
He knows the Superman.

29:05.295 --> 29:08.298
He wants to take him down,
but now he's behind bars.

29:08.365 --> 29:12.102
Lucky for Lobo, I'm not.

29:12.169 --> 29:14.404
So that's it.
You took down Luthor

29:14.471 --> 29:17.774
and now you're doing
an expose on the Flying Man?

29:18.709 --> 29:20.410
No.

29:20.477 --> 29:23.280
I'm winning a Pulitzer
for my revelatory takedown

29:23.347 --> 29:26.985
of the alien who calls himself
"The Superman."

29:27.051 --> 29:28.619
He doesn't call himself that!

29:33.457 --> 29:37.594
Not "Flying Man,"
not "Superman," not "Clark..."

29:39.396 --> 29:41.365
Certainly not "Kryptonian."

29:41.431 --> 29:43.500
It's everything
you warned me about.

29:43.567 --> 29:44.902
They meet someone
from the stars

29:44.969 --> 29:47.905
and their first instinct
is to fire at will.

29:49.239 --> 29:51.208
They love you.

29:54.979 --> 29:56.513
They don't know me.

29:57.581 --> 30:00.417
And I'm afraid that,
when they do...

30:00.484 --> 30:03.220
Maybe you're what they need.
If they knew about you,

30:03.286 --> 30:04.788
maybe they'd
see things differently.

30:04.856 --> 30:09.426
Or maybe the government
will lock him up, or worse.

30:09.493 --> 30:11.062
At some point
they're gonna ask me

30:11.129 --> 30:13.530
where I'm from
and why I was sent here,

30:13.597 --> 30:16.299
and I won't have the answers.

30:16.366 --> 30:18.201
And in the meantime,
one way or another,

30:18.268 --> 30:22.572
Lois is going to
publish her expose.

30:22.639 --> 30:25.609
You know what we're gonna say.
What we've always said.

30:25.676 --> 30:29.579
"The world is dangerous
and unforgiving."

30:29.646 --> 30:32.950
If you're different, special,
you have two options.

30:33.017 --> 30:34.518
You can either...

30:34.584 --> 30:36.186
"Either meet it head-on
and accept the consequences,

30:36.253 --> 30:39.489
or you can keep your head down
and accept the consequences.

30:39.556 --> 30:41.224
There's no wrong choice,
but..."

30:41.291 --> 30:43.427
You have to make one.

30:43.861 --> 30:45.328
Why?

30:45.395 --> 30:48.598
Because you're not
our little boy anymore.

30:48.665 --> 30:51.668
Becoming a man means making
these choices for yourself.

30:52.703 --> 30:54.005
Just be ready,

30:54.072 --> 30:57.841
because each choice,
each action, has a consequence.

31:12.489 --> 31:14.291
Excuse me, do we know...

31:14.357 --> 31:15.459
Nothing yet.

31:16.293 --> 31:18.762
Is Daddy gonna be okay?

31:33.111 --> 31:34.745
Here we go.

31:39.851 --> 31:42.452
Half the liver,
one kidney, the spleen.

31:42.519 --> 31:44.654
Every day another organ fails.

31:44.721 --> 31:46.958
What the hell happened
to this guy?

31:47.024 --> 31:48.458
I'm going to
close him back up.

31:48.525 --> 31:49.894
Give me the...

31:52.864 --> 31:55.332
Code Black!
Call it in! Go!

31:56.566 --> 31:58.401
Agh! Agh!

32:34.906 --> 32:37.707
I know it's not for good,
but sure is nice

32:37.774 --> 32:40.310
having you here
helping out, Clark.

32:40.377 --> 32:42.146
Pa, I can help anytime.

32:42.213 --> 32:44.282
It takes me less than ten minutes
to get here from the city,

32:44.347 --> 32:46.250
you just have to
let me know when...

32:46.316 --> 32:47.417
Clark?

32:47.484 --> 32:49.053
Stop the truck.

33:08.272 --> 33:10.107
Evening, stranger.

33:11.275 --> 33:13.044
I've come for your son.

33:16.214 --> 33:17.714
Our son isn't here.

33:19.283 --> 33:21.118
Something we can do for ya?

33:22.220 --> 33:24.055
You can tell me where he is.

33:25.655 --> 33:28.192
Sir, unless you want to
show us some credentials,

33:28.259 --> 33:30.393
I think we're done here.

33:32.362 --> 33:33.898
Martha, get behind me.

33:34.899 --> 33:37.301
I'm sorry.

33:37.367 --> 33:39.303
Sorry for wh...

33:39.369 --> 33:44.407
Jonathan? What's happening?
What are you doing to him?

34:00.390 --> 34:01.893
Get inside, lock the doors.

34:30.754 --> 34:32.722
Are you another bounty hunter?

34:40.331 --> 34:42.766
I am no Bounty Hunter.

34:44.467 --> 34:47.737
My name is J'onn.

34:49.173 --> 34:52.542
And I only wish to
speak with you.

35:00.351 --> 35:02.153
Call me when you
need the refill.

35:04.454 --> 35:05.990
Ahem. Next?

35:11.329 --> 35:14.831
Uh, did, uh, someone call in
a prescription for you, sir?

35:14.899 --> 35:17.734
Pain... I have... so much...

35:17.801 --> 35:20.271
- Sir, you don't look...
- Drugs.

35:20.338 --> 35:23.074
I'm sorry, without a
prescription, I can't help you.

35:23.140 --> 35:26.043
But there is a clinic nearby
where you can detox...

35:26.110 --> 35:27.311
I need to get home!

35:33.084 --> 35:34.651
I need...

35:34.718 --> 35:37.121
a post-surgical analgesic.

35:38.055 --> 35:39.622
Fentanyl.

35:39.689 --> 35:41.624
I need fentanyl!

35:52.236 --> 35:53.204
Huh?

36:06.649 --> 36:09.586
I apologize
for frightening you earlier.

36:09.652 --> 36:11.255
- Are you...
- I'm fine.

36:11.322 --> 36:14.524
Just don't get
in my head again, okay?

36:14.591 --> 36:17.727
I'm sure you boys
have a lot to talk about.

36:17.794 --> 36:21.132
Clark, if...
John is staying over,

36:21.198 --> 36:23.300
there are sheets
in the hall cupboard and...

36:23.367 --> 36:25.635
We're fine, Ma. G'night.

36:34.844 --> 36:37.814
I thought Martians
only existed in the movies.

36:39.917 --> 36:42.219
Those movies are terrible.

36:45.022 --> 36:49.659
Thank you. For S.T.A.R. Labs.
You saved my life.

36:51.828 --> 36:55.199
I should never have
revealed my natural form.

36:55.266 --> 36:57.034
Why did you?

36:57.101 --> 36:59.602
I mean, if you can
disguise yourself...

36:59.669 --> 37:01.472
To distract Lobo.

37:01.539 --> 37:04.341
He came for
the last Kryptonian.

37:04.408 --> 37:07.278
I offered him something
of equal value.

37:07.344 --> 37:11.282
You're... the last.
You're like me.

37:14.051 --> 37:17.121
It was
a foolish miscalculation.

37:17.188 --> 37:20.257
This world wasn't ready.

37:20.324 --> 37:25.863
Ready or not, Lobo came to us.
That's when everything changed.

37:25.930 --> 37:29.433
Nevertheless, I will be
reverting to human form

37:29.500 --> 37:33.904
and maintaining a low profile
for the foreseeable future.

37:33.971 --> 37:36.540
I advise you to do the same.

37:36.606 --> 37:39.910
If we remain hidden, we live.

37:41.345 --> 37:43.581
Doesn't sound like
much of a life.

37:43.646 --> 37:45.015
Perhaps not.

37:45.082 --> 37:48.018
But as the last survivors
of our people,

37:48.085 --> 37:51.754
is self-preservation
not our chief responsibility?

37:53.790 --> 37:56.894
I have seen firsthand
how rampant xenophobia

37:56.961 --> 37:59.997
can destroy
a great civilization.

38:00.064 --> 38:02.867
If humanity is to have
a chance to thrive,

38:02.933 --> 38:06.836
we mustn't further
stoke its fears.

38:06.904 --> 38:09.406
I don't think anything
can stop that now.

38:09.473 --> 38:13.444
<i>The Daily Planet</i> is about to
publish the truth about me.

38:13.511 --> 38:15.012
Then we must stop them.

38:15.079 --> 38:17.414
J'onn, this world
is beginning to see me

38:17.481 --> 38:19.049
as some sort of champion.

38:20.117 --> 38:22.586
What if knowing
the truth about me

38:22.652 --> 38:23.888
is what turns this around,

38:23.954 --> 38:26.190
makes people
see things differently?

38:31.095 --> 38:33.330
You are an optimist, Kal-El.

38:33.898 --> 38:35.466
Like your father.

38:35.533 --> 38:37.700
Kal-El?

38:37.767 --> 38:40.404
Forgive me.
When I first became aware

38:40.471 --> 38:43.607
that you possess abilities
similar to my own,

38:43.673 --> 38:47.211
I assumed...
hoped you were Martian.

38:48.811 --> 38:51.781
I attempted a telepathic link
between our minds

38:51.848 --> 38:53.384
and in doing so,

38:53.450 --> 38:57.588
I inadvertently accessed
your memories of Krypton.

38:57.655 --> 38:59.623
I have no memories of Krypton.

38:59.689 --> 39:01.892
You were only an infant.

39:14.038 --> 39:16.440
I've never been able to
make this thing work.

39:27.885 --> 39:28.886
Is that...

39:28.953 --> 39:31.121
Your parents.

39:31.188 --> 39:33.123
I was able to pick up
some Kryptonian

39:33.190 --> 39:35.025
from your memories of them.

39:35.092 --> 39:38.795
I could teach you and help you
access those memories.

39:38.862 --> 39:40.464
But you should know
that the last thing

39:40.531 --> 39:44.935
your mother ever said to you
was that "to dwell in the past

39:45.002 --> 39:47.271
is to lose one's path."

39:52.176 --> 39:54.612
You have
a weighty decision to make.

39:54.678 --> 39:56.247
I'll leave you to it.

40:02.720 --> 40:04.154
Wait.

40:05.356 --> 40:06.957
How will I find you?

40:07.024 --> 40:08.892
<i>Just listen.</i>

40:30.014 --> 40:31.814
Have you been up all night?

40:31.882 --> 40:33.984
Yeah, pretty much.

40:36.287 --> 40:37.221
Thank you.

40:37.288 --> 40:39.156
Twenty-four years
collecting dust

40:39.223 --> 40:41.859
and your new friend
gets it working in one try.

40:41.925 --> 40:43.360
So what is it?

40:43.427 --> 40:46.330
I don't know.
Some kind of historical record?

40:46.397 --> 40:49.099
I've barely
scratched the surface.

40:49.799 --> 40:51.201
It was incredible, Ma.

40:51.268 --> 40:53.470
I can't believe
I'll never get to see it.

40:55.072 --> 40:56.573
Maybe you will.

40:56.640 --> 40:59.009
I'm beginning to think
you can do almost anything.

40:59.076 --> 41:02.179
Go anywhere. Only...

41:03.914 --> 41:04.915
What?

41:04.982 --> 41:06.550
You can go anywhere,

41:06.617 --> 41:10.554
but, as all those photos
posted all over the world show,

41:10.621 --> 41:12.890
your clothes can't.

41:21.031 --> 41:22.599
Did you make this?

41:22.666 --> 41:26.804
From the only fabric I know
that's been to outer space.

41:26.870 --> 41:29.606
You were swaddled in it
when we found you.

41:31.442 --> 41:34.244
Otherwise, I just copied
the design of that nice Batman

41:34.311 --> 41:36.880
I always see in the papers
at the checkout.

41:39.183 --> 41:40.617
You even did the cape.

41:40.684 --> 41:42.319
Now I don't know
if it'll hold up

41:42.386 --> 41:43.987
to the stress
you'll put it through,

41:44.054 --> 41:46.023
but we went through
16 bandsaw blades

41:46.090 --> 41:48.792
just to cut the fabric, so...

41:48.859 --> 41:51.061
Whattaya think?

41:51.128 --> 41:53.063
I think you're saying

41:53.130 --> 41:56.066
you want me to
tell the world who I really am.

41:56.667 --> 41:58.402
No, I'm saying

41:58.469 --> 42:02.106
we're not buying you any more
nice clothes to destroy.

42:03.707 --> 42:06.610
I love it, Ma. Thank you.

42:12.716 --> 42:14.351
It's out!

42:28.665 --> 42:30.100
Well?

42:30.167 --> 42:32.236
It's only part one.
She's teasing something big,

42:32.302 --> 42:35.205
but won't say what
until she interviews Lobo.

42:36.306 --> 42:38.475
I have to get back
to Metropolis.

42:38.542 --> 42:40.811
Maybe I can get her
to put the brakes on

42:40.879 --> 42:42.746
while I figure out what to do.

42:42.813 --> 42:44.715
What about your laundry?

42:44.782 --> 42:45.983
I'll get it later.

42:46.049 --> 42:48.552
Love the suit,
especially the cape!

42:50.954 --> 42:52.723
You added a cape?

42:52.790 --> 42:54.525
I think it looks cool.

43:02.533 --> 43:03.767
Stop it!

43:03.834 --> 43:07.638
Oh, don't like that one?
How 'bout this:

43:07.704 --> 43:10.441
"I met an old female in heat"

43:10.507 --> 43:14.645
Stop! Oh, my God!
What is wrong with you?

43:15.746 --> 43:17.815
Why don't I show ya?

43:17.882 --> 43:19.851
Come on, girlie.

43:33.063 --> 43:34.832
Good for you?

43:34.899 --> 43:36.500
Last question.

43:36.567 --> 43:38.635
You told me he's the only one
of his people here on Earth.

43:38.702 --> 43:40.103
Are there more on the way?

43:40.170 --> 43:43.841
Kryptonians? Yeah,
they're on their way all right.

43:43.908 --> 43:47.244
A whole army
comin' just for him.

43:47.311 --> 43:50.314
And those bloodthirsty
sons of bitches don't care

43:50.380 --> 43:53.083
who they gotta liquify
to get 'im.

43:54.618 --> 43:56.787
Nah!

43:56.855 --> 43:58.188
Jes' kiddin'.

43:58.255 --> 43:59.858
They're all dead,

43:59.924 --> 44:03.694
but you shoulda seen
the look on yer face though!

44:03.760 --> 44:05.195
Classic!

44:10.834 --> 44:13.303
And then summa this.
And summa that.

44:13.370 --> 44:16.573
And then I give it a little
bit 'o wam-bam-boom...

44:16.640 --> 44:19.276
Ugh. All right,
that's enough.

44:19.343 --> 44:20.945
That's enough.

44:21.011 --> 44:24.883
That wasn't even half
the Appellaxian mating dance.

44:24.949 --> 44:26.483
I don't blame ya,

44:26.550 --> 44:28.685
- I'm a whole lotta man...
- We're done here.

44:28.752 --> 44:30.354
Open up.

44:32.991 --> 44:34.057
What on Earth...

44:42.232 --> 44:45.302
Maybe you should run along
now, sweetybits.

45:48.599 --> 45:50.634
You...

45:50.701 --> 45:52.202
You did this!

45:52.269 --> 45:55.105
Hey, man,
I jes' work here.

45:55.172 --> 45:57.407
What's happening to me?

46:28.605 --> 46:29.539
Okay then.

46:33.610 --> 46:36.713
Now where'd those assholes
put my bike.

47:07.310 --> 47:08.812
Are you all right, Miss Lane?

47:11.415 --> 47:13.183
I think so.

47:13.250 --> 47:14.751
Paramedics are on their way.

47:16.120 --> 47:17.554
But I have to go after him.

47:19.756 --> 47:21.458
Superman?

47:21.525 --> 47:23.694
You're right about my origins,
Lois,

47:24.594 --> 47:26.263
but not my intentions.

47:27.330 --> 47:29.332
Please don't run your story.

47:29.399 --> 47:31.334
I should be the one
to tell the world.

47:35.472 --> 47:36.974
First you have to save it.

47:39.476 --> 47:41.244
We're overdue
for that interview.

47:43.948 --> 47:45.682
Maybe when this is over.

47:45.749 --> 47:46.817
I'll be there.

47:46.884 --> 47:48.285
No games, I promise.

47:50.587 --> 47:53.757
And Superman...
Don't let him touch you.

48:28.926 --> 48:30.327
What the hell?

48:33.463 --> 48:34.798
Let them go.

48:51.082 --> 48:52.415
Nice work.

48:52.482 --> 48:54.518
Now let's get these
people to safety before...

49:00.191 --> 49:01.825
Go! I'll try to hold him back.

49:17.942 --> 49:21.913
So... much... power!

49:34.324 --> 49:37.661
Oh, yes...

49:38.728 --> 49:40.463
Yes...

49:41.132 --> 49:43.366
More...

49:49.606 --> 49:51.075
How are we doing J'onn?

50:06.157 --> 50:07.824
Yes...

50:08.259 --> 50:10.027
Yes...

50:13.931 --> 50:14.966
Kent.

50:15.967 --> 50:17.068
The intern...

50:18.302 --> 50:21.138
Or is it Kal-El?

50:30.982 --> 50:33.416
No, don't touch him.

50:41.558 --> 50:43.526
J'onn J'onzz...

50:43.593 --> 50:45.263
the manhunter...

50:52.602 --> 50:54.005
Stop this.

50:55.006 --> 50:56.506
Please.

50:59.076 --> 51:01.444
No. No, please.

51:04.781 --> 51:05.883
Ahhh.

51:23.700 --> 51:25.468
Oh!

52:23.793 --> 52:25.662
Clark!

52:25.729 --> 52:27.064
Hey, Clark!

52:29.733 --> 52:31.801
- Clark?
- It was unlocked.

52:32.569 --> 52:33.971
What happened?

52:34.038 --> 52:35.306
I, uh...

52:35.373 --> 52:36.673
I broke the glass.

52:36.740 --> 52:38.608
No kidding.

52:38.675 --> 52:40.077
I mean, what were you doing

52:40.144 --> 52:42.213
in the middle
of the attack yesterday?

52:42.279 --> 52:43.280
How did you know?

52:44.848 --> 52:46.484
You gave a statement
to the police.

52:46.549 --> 52:47.852
You know, Clark,

52:47.918 --> 52:49.552
there are much easier ways
to get the story.

52:50.388 --> 52:51.255
There are?

52:51.922 --> 52:52.822
No!

52:52.890 --> 52:54.125
Actually running in there

52:54.191 --> 52:55.558
was exactly what
I should have done.

52:56.494 --> 52:58.095
Why are you here?

52:58.162 --> 53:00.830
Perry read the police report
and asked me to check on you.

53:02.632 --> 53:05.835
Actually he ordered me
to fire you

53:05.903 --> 53:07.570
for not showing up today but

53:07.637 --> 53:09.773
I think I got
the translation right.

53:16.414 --> 53:18.015
Well, did you see him
in action?

53:20.617 --> 53:22.053
Who?

53:22.119 --> 53:23.220
The Superman.

53:23.287 --> 53:24.288
Oh.

53:24.355 --> 53:25.523
Yeah.

53:25.588 --> 53:27.124
And the Martian Manhunter.

53:27.191 --> 53:29.726
The Martian Manhunter?
That's terrible.

53:29.793 --> 53:31.761
But it's your story so...

53:32.629 --> 53:34.564
It burnt him alive, Lois.

53:35.299 --> 53:36.867
That Parasite thing.

53:37.935 --> 53:39.904
I can still hear the screams.

53:41.539 --> 53:42.973
And the Superman?

53:49.646 --> 53:51.215
I think he's dead, too.

53:56.187 --> 53:57.321
Lois, this job...

53:59.323 --> 54:00.858
Not what you expected?

54:02.960 --> 54:04.528
It's so much harder...

54:04.594 --> 54:07.531
this whole story.

54:07.597 --> 54:09.033
I'd only just gotten started

54:09.100 --> 54:11.202
and now I think
I may have lost it.

54:12.203 --> 54:13.170
Maybe for good.

54:15.339 --> 54:16.273
Clark.

54:17.541 --> 54:18.808
You've chosen a job

54:18.876 --> 54:19.944
that can put you face to face

54:20.010 --> 54:22.279
to some pretty bad stuff.

54:22.346 --> 54:25.715
You try and make a difference
and fight for truth,

54:26.150 --> 54:27.184
justice,

54:27.251 --> 54:28.685
and sometimes
you get smacked down.

54:28.751 --> 54:30.820
But let me tell you,
Clark Kent.

54:30.888 --> 54:32.289
If this is what you want,

54:32.356 --> 54:33.656
if it's who you are,

54:33.723 --> 54:35.259
then you have to do it.

54:35.960 --> 54:37.595
But this job takes guts.

54:37.660 --> 54:39.497
It takes risk.

54:39.563 --> 54:41.298
And maybe
one of those risks is,

54:41.365 --> 54:42.900
when you feel overwhelmed

54:42.967 --> 54:44.301
to open yourself up

54:44.368 --> 54:46.703
and ask someone
smarter than you for help.

54:48.606 --> 54:50.707
Someone smarter than me?

54:50.773 --> 54:52.775
I bet, they're closer
than you think.

54:54.644 --> 54:56.046
You're totally right.

54:57.148 --> 54:58.048
Perfect.

54:59.049 --> 55:00.650
First, give me your source.

55:01.952 --> 55:04.654
Lois, did you come here
to steal my story?

55:04.721 --> 55:05.688
What?

55:05.755 --> 55:07.757
No! No!

55:08.926 --> 55:12.062
I thought that
we would share it.

55:12.129 --> 55:13.696
You know what,
thanks for coming, Lois.

55:13.763 --> 55:14.865
Really, thank you.
Tell Perry

55:14.932 --> 55:16.901
he can't fire me
because I quit.

55:16.967 --> 55:19.136
For now, sorry, I got to go.

55:19.203 --> 55:20.703
What? Where?

55:20.770 --> 55:21.939
To talk to someone smart.

55:22.006 --> 55:23.908
I was going to split
the byline.

55:42.660 --> 55:44.228
Is it still Halloween?

55:46.230 --> 55:47.264
No.

55:47.331 --> 55:48.566
Let's just say,
it's more practical

55:48.632 --> 55:50.267
than cargos and aviator caps.

55:52.303 --> 55:53.736
Ah-ha.

55:53.803 --> 55:55.139
And what's the "S" for?

55:56.440 --> 55:57.341
Superman.

55:59.276 --> 56:00.277
Right.

56:00.344 --> 56:02.845
Well, Superman,
what's this about?

56:04.348 --> 56:05.316
I need your help.

56:06.617 --> 56:08.185
I've seen you in action,
flyboy.

56:08.252 --> 56:10.254
You're as powerful
as a locomotive.

56:11.388 --> 56:12.590
More.

56:12.656 --> 56:14.024
Usually.

56:14.091 --> 56:17.161
So how could I possibly
help you?

56:18.429 --> 56:19.930
I need to get into space.

56:20.397 --> 56:22.166
Fast.

56:22.233 --> 56:24.902
Not the most practical
getaway plan.

56:28.572 --> 56:29.839
The sun!

56:29.907 --> 56:32.343
It's like a power source
for you, isn't it?

56:32.409 --> 56:34.378
And if you need help
getting closer to it,

56:34.445 --> 56:35.713
that means you're...

56:35.778 --> 56:36.914
powerless.

56:37.681 --> 56:38.882
Interesting.

56:40.817 --> 56:42.620
You've seen the news reports.

56:42.686 --> 56:45.522
This creature, this Parasite.

56:46.724 --> 56:48.492
It killed my friend.

56:48.559 --> 56:51.761
Now everyone is in danger
and I can't stop it.

56:51.828 --> 56:53.497
Not like this.

56:53.564 --> 56:54.764
Can you help me?

56:55.499 --> 56:57.234
Of course I can, but...

56:59.003 --> 57:00.404
How much do you want?

57:01.372 --> 57:03.374
Money? I have money.

57:03.440 --> 57:05.609
No, I don't want anything
but to help.

57:05.676 --> 57:09.046
It can only look good
to the parole board.

57:09.113 --> 57:11.415
But I can't help you
from in here.

57:11.482 --> 57:12.916
I have to get out.

57:12.983 --> 57:15.386
That's not going to happen,
Luthor.

57:15.452 --> 57:16.854
Relax.

57:16.920 --> 57:18.322
I can get a day pass.

57:19.657 --> 57:20.891
A day pass?

57:20.958 --> 57:23.360
That's not even a thing.

57:24.528 --> 57:25.795
Wanna bet?

57:41.278 --> 57:42.513
Kaylie!

57:42.579 --> 57:43.647
Breakfast!

57:43.714 --> 57:46.250
I can't find my shoe, Mommy!

58:14.678 --> 58:16.380
Ahhh!

58:19.249 --> 58:20.918
Kaylie, what's wrong?

58:46.243 --> 58:47.945
It's good to be home.

58:48.512 --> 58:50.013
You live here?

58:50.080 --> 58:51.215
Practically.

58:54.418 --> 58:56.420
So this "Parasite" zaps
your powers,

58:56.487 --> 58:58.522
now you're a filthy mortal
like the rest of us.

58:58.589 --> 58:59.590
Do I have it?

59:00.524 --> 59:01.625
Something like that.

59:01.692 --> 59:03.093
I still have my abilities

59:03.160 --> 59:04.661
but they are very weak.

59:04.728 --> 59:05.929
Some more than others.

59:05.996 --> 59:07.231
It may be slow going,

59:07.297 --> 59:09.133
but you'll return
to full strength.

59:11.135 --> 59:12.369
Eventually.

59:12.436 --> 59:14.838
There's no time.
I need a jump start.

59:14.905 --> 59:17.040
Can you shoot me
into orbit or not?

59:17.107 --> 59:19.176
I'm not launching you
into space.

59:19.243 --> 59:20.310
Why not?

59:20.377 --> 59:22.746
Because you are right now
a fragile egg.

59:22.813 --> 59:24.248
Untrained and unprepared

59:24.314 --> 59:26.517
for the grueling reality
of space flight.

59:26.583 --> 59:29.153
Unless your secret identity
is an astronaut.

59:30.754 --> 59:32.589
Didn't think so.

59:32.656 --> 59:33.757
Anyway, don't worry.

59:33.824 --> 59:35.125
I have a plan.

59:42.433 --> 59:44.968
This is from S.T.A.R. labs.
How did you get this?

59:45.035 --> 59:46.203
Yup.

59:46.270 --> 59:48.238
There's your problem.

59:49.440 --> 59:50.407
The janitor...

59:50.474 --> 59:52.676
That grenade
was an organic EMP,

59:52.743 --> 59:54.011
designed to absorb

59:54.077 --> 59:56.346
all the power
it comes in contact with.

59:56.413 --> 59:59.082
It's almost like it
melded with the janitor's DNA

59:59.149 --> 1:00:01.585
and turned him into
some kind of energy vampire.

1:00:03.922 --> 1:00:06.123
It takes everything.

1:00:06.190 --> 1:00:07.926
How do you fight
something like that?

1:00:07.991 --> 1:00:09.726
I just told you.

1:00:09.793 --> 1:00:12.329
"It takes everything."

1:00:12.396 --> 1:00:14.598
It's like buying a company,
when you absorb the assets,

1:00:14.665 --> 1:00:17.534
you also absorb
the vulnerabilities.

1:00:17.601 --> 1:00:21.104
If we can employ those,
we can defeat it.

1:00:21.171 --> 1:00:24.741
So... what are Superman's
weaknesses?

1:00:24.808 --> 1:00:26.743
I don't know. I'm not sure
if I ever had any.

1:00:26.810 --> 1:00:27.912
I wasn't talking to you.

1:00:35.018 --> 1:00:36.019
Lobo.

1:00:36.086 --> 1:00:37.087
Even on the inside,

1:00:37.154 --> 1:00:38.655
I like to keep close tabs

1:00:38.722 --> 1:00:40.390
on all the happenings
about town.

1:00:40.457 --> 1:00:42.961
Once the Czarnian here
was liberated from the cell

1:00:43.026 --> 1:00:44.528
you put him in
at S.T.A.R. Labs...

1:00:46.263 --> 1:00:48.098
Thanks fer that, by the way.

1:00:48.165 --> 1:00:50.000
it was an easy matter
for one of my surrogates

1:00:50.067 --> 1:00:51.535
to track down
the bounty hunter

1:00:51.602 --> 1:00:52.904
and... cut a deal.

1:00:52.971 --> 1:00:54.204
A deal?

1:00:54.271 --> 1:00:56.173
You might say
I bought the company.

1:00:56.240 --> 1:00:59.610
Lobo is now my asset...

1:00:59.676 --> 1:01:01.478
...or vulnerability.

1:01:01.545 --> 1:01:02.579
Time will tell.

1:01:03.982 --> 1:01:05.315
The ring.

1:01:05.382 --> 1:01:08.018
Carved from irradiated remains
of Krypton.

1:01:08.085 --> 1:01:10.420
I don't know how or why,
but it weakened me.

1:01:10.855 --> 1:01:11.788
A lot.

1:01:14.825 --> 1:01:18.295
That's what we use to fight off
the superpowered Parasite.

1:01:26.004 --> 1:01:27.972
Extraordinary amount
of radiation

1:01:28.038 --> 1:01:29.673
for something so minuscule.

1:01:30.875 --> 1:01:32.209
Harmless to humans,

1:01:32.276 --> 1:01:34.545
but having absorbed
your powers...

1:01:34.611 --> 1:01:35.746
this might work.

1:01:38.448 --> 1:01:40.517
We just need
to get its attention.

1:01:45.122 --> 1:01:46.256
Mmm,

1:01:46.323 --> 1:01:49.126
somethin' I like
about this place.

1:01:49.192 --> 1:01:50.895
This plant powers
the entire city.

1:01:50.962 --> 1:01:52.262
Where is everybody?

1:01:55.332 --> 1:01:58.835
I called in a bomb threat
before we left.

1:01:58.903 --> 1:02:00.771
You shouldn't lie about bombs.

1:02:03.240 --> 1:02:04.675
I didn't.

1:02:28.765 --> 1:02:31.234
Looks like Lex was able
to boost the output.

1:02:32.003 --> 1:02:33.236
Now we wait.

1:02:58.930 --> 1:03:00.098
Wait's over.

1:03:00.163 --> 1:03:02.566
It's ass-whoopin'
time.

1:03:15.046 --> 1:03:16.114
Here we go.

1:03:16.179 --> 1:03:17.514
Feeling any stronger?

1:03:17.581 --> 1:03:18.649
Let's see.

1:03:43.206 --> 1:03:45.943
Well? Am I paying you
to stand around?

1:03:46.010 --> 1:03:49.479
Yeah, yeah, don't get
your panties in a twist.

1:03:53.684 --> 1:03:55.652
Hell, yeah!

1:04:12.036 --> 1:04:14.172
Whoo...

1:04:22.245 --> 1:04:24.448
Go down, damn it!

1:04:28.052 --> 1:04:30.320
The ring, it's not working.

1:04:30.387 --> 1:04:31.688
It looks like there's a limit

1:04:31.755 --> 1:04:33.925
to how long the Parasite
can retain your power...

1:04:34.825 --> 1:04:35.860
and weakness.

1:04:42.232 --> 1:04:43.300
Lobo!

1:04:44.869 --> 1:04:46.470
Eat... shit...

1:04:47.370 --> 1:04:48.839
bastich...

1:04:48.906 --> 1:04:49.874
No.

1:05:10.962 --> 1:05:11.863
No.

1:05:54.304 --> 1:05:56.107
They have to hold their fire!

1:05:56.174 --> 1:05:57.641
It's only
making him stronger!

1:05:57.707 --> 1:06:00.278
I'll make a call,
but we need Lobo's ring.

1:06:00.343 --> 1:06:02.512
If this thing absorbs
all the power from the plant,

1:06:02.579 --> 1:06:04.514
it'll become
too strong to take down.

1:06:04.581 --> 1:06:06.316
Then he can't
make it to the plant.

1:06:06.383 --> 1:06:07.784
What are you going to do?

1:06:14.258 --> 1:06:15.692
Give him a weakness.

1:06:19.130 --> 1:06:21.299
Hey! Want some more?

1:06:21.364 --> 1:06:22.732
I'm right here!

1:07:15.418 --> 1:07:17.520
Troupe. T-R-O...

1:07:17.587 --> 1:07:20.291
Yeah. Yeah. I'm still
holding for the Pentagon.

1:07:20.358 --> 1:07:21.926
What? Are you...

1:07:21.993 --> 1:07:24.195
That's 45 minutes
on hold, Lane.

1:07:24.262 --> 1:07:25.897
I was almost through!

1:07:25.963 --> 1:07:27.664
City is on lockdown. We're not
allowed to leave the building.

1:07:27.731 --> 1:07:29.733
- But...
- Yeah?

1:07:29.799 --> 1:07:31.735
The story is out there.

1:07:51.122 --> 1:07:52.489
Need more power?

1:07:52.555 --> 1:07:53.925
Well, come and get it!

1:08:18.548 --> 1:08:20.184
Lex!

1:08:20.251 --> 1:08:21.953
See, here's my problem.

1:08:22.954 --> 1:08:24.821
The Parasite
is very powerful.

1:08:24.889 --> 1:08:28.025
But the Superman
is also very powerful.

1:08:28.092 --> 1:08:30.493
Lex, no!

1:08:33.530 --> 1:08:35.465
Right now, the man
with the ring

1:08:35.532 --> 1:08:37.667
is the most
powerful of all.

1:08:37.734 --> 1:08:39.971
So, which is
the bigger threat?

1:08:44.141 --> 1:08:48.611
A simple janitor transformed into
a monster by futuristic tech?

1:08:48.678 --> 1:08:50.513
Or the super-powered alien

1:08:51.315 --> 1:08:52.849
lying to humanity

1:08:52.917 --> 1:08:54.986
masquerading
as one of us?

1:09:00.490 --> 1:09:02.426
Oh, hell.

1:09:02.492 --> 1:09:04.996
I'll just make
you both my slaves.

1:09:28.853 --> 1:09:31.654
Magnifying Pulse Rifle.

1:09:31.721 --> 1:09:34.025
LexCorp security issue.

1:09:34.091 --> 1:09:35.359
Pretty sweet, huh?

1:09:50.673 --> 1:09:52.043
Are you all right?

1:09:54.844 --> 1:09:56.447
But, the Parasite...

1:09:56.514 --> 1:09:58.015
I saw it kill you.

1:09:59.749 --> 1:10:02.086
You saw what
I wanted it to see.

1:10:25.976 --> 1:10:28.913
Those people
are in grave danger.

1:10:40.224 --> 1:10:41.559
That ring will kill you.

1:10:41.624 --> 1:10:44.161
I don't know any other way.

1:10:49.400 --> 1:10:50.700
Find one.

1:11:09.320 --> 1:11:11.388
Choppers are grounded.
TV crews can't get in.

1:11:38.916 --> 1:11:41.018
Lois Lane, live at the scene.

1:11:41.085 --> 1:11:42.586
We're on foot
and we have a phone,

1:11:42.652 --> 1:11:44.088
so we're live-streaming.

1:11:44.155 --> 1:11:46.157
The military have tried
to keep the crowd back,

1:11:46.223 --> 1:11:48.192
but at this point, we've
got a lot of angry people

1:11:48.259 --> 1:11:49.894
who are ready
to make a stand

1:11:49.960 --> 1:11:52.863
against what they see as
an extra-terrestrial threat.

1:11:55.732 --> 1:11:58.668
Superman may be
the only thing

1:11:58.735 --> 1:12:01.005
that stands between
the people of Metropolis

1:12:01.071 --> 1:12:02.940
and total annihilation.

1:12:03.007 --> 1:12:05.176
But, if the eyewitness
reports are true,

1:12:05.242 --> 1:12:07.144
the Parasite
can absorb our strength,

1:12:07.211 --> 1:12:09.812
knowledge, our feelings,
our essence...

1:12:12.682 --> 1:12:14.051
Feelings?

1:12:14.885 --> 1:12:16.420
My essence.

1:12:21.358 --> 1:12:22.593
Rudy!

1:12:22.660 --> 1:12:24.028
Rudy Jones!

1:12:24.094 --> 1:12:26.096
I know you're still
in there, Rudy.

1:12:30.568 --> 1:12:32.136
I know you remember me.

1:12:33.571 --> 1:12:36.373
And I know if you've
absorbed everything about me,

1:12:36.440 --> 1:12:39.910
then you haven't just gotten
just my powers or my knowledge.

1:12:39.977 --> 1:12:42.812
You've gotten my heart.

1:12:42.880 --> 1:12:45.683
My love for my family
and friends.

1:12:45.748 --> 1:12:47.618
My need to keep them safe.

1:12:47.685 --> 1:12:51.021
Rudy, you are a combat veteran
who served with honor.

1:12:55.426 --> 1:12:58.429
A proud father
of one in first grade.

1:12:59.430 --> 1:13:00.564
<i>Kaylie, right?</i>

1:13:00.631 --> 1:13:02.066
<i>And another on the way.</i>

1:13:03.300 --> 1:13:05.369
I'm sorry this
happened to you.

1:13:06.237 --> 1:13:07.871
But, whatever else you are,

1:13:07.938 --> 1:13:10.374
Rudy, whatever you've become,

1:13:10.441 --> 1:13:12.910
I know you're still
the same as me.

1:13:14.144 --> 1:13:16.947
You don't really want
anyone to get hurt.

1:13:19.984 --> 1:13:21.952
What are you doing?

1:13:22.019 --> 1:13:24.088
Stop! All of you!

1:13:25.822 --> 1:13:27.790
He's not the alien.

1:13:27.858 --> 1:13:29.159
I am.

1:13:31.428 --> 1:13:33.197
I see the anger in you.

1:13:33.264 --> 1:13:37.901
But, the truth is,
you don't hate aliens.

1:13:37.968 --> 1:13:40.971
You're scared,
terrified of them,

1:13:41.038 --> 1:13:42.973
even when they're not there.

1:13:44.241 --> 1:13:45.842
This man's name
is Rudy Jones.

1:13:45.909 --> 1:13:48.479
He's the victim
of a terrible accident.

1:13:49.413 --> 1:13:51.615
But, he was born here.

1:13:51.682 --> 1:13:53.050
He's one of you.

1:13:55.586 --> 1:13:57.054
And so am I.

1:14:00.457 --> 1:14:04.261
I was born in the last days
of a dying planet.

1:14:04.328 --> 1:14:06.829
My parents' hope was that
they had sent me to a world

1:14:06.897 --> 1:14:09.033
where I would be
safe and protected.

1:14:09.099 --> 1:14:11.268
But, the price
of that protection,

1:14:11.335 --> 1:14:14.405
silence about who
and what I really am,

1:14:14.471 --> 1:14:18.008
while others like me
face persecution, or worse...

1:14:19.343 --> 1:14:22.179
I was scared,
but I'm not scared anymore.

1:14:25.883 --> 1:14:28.252
My name is Kal-El of Krypton.

1:14:29.153 --> 1:14:30.521
And I come in peace.

1:15:06.357 --> 1:15:08.392
Die, you bastard!

1:15:11.662 --> 1:15:13.397
Stop!

1:15:17.368 --> 1:15:18.469
Rudy, wait!

1:15:56.640 --> 1:15:59.543
Oh, God.

1:16:13.791 --> 1:16:16.360
You should have let me
turn the damn thing off.

1:16:18.929 --> 1:16:21.398
Superman!
The reactor!

1:18:02.967 --> 1:18:04.268
Rudy!

1:19:32.656 --> 1:19:34.458
Is that
really you this time?

1:19:34.524 --> 1:19:36.493
Or is it
a telepathic trick?

1:19:38.930 --> 1:19:40.898
I've apologized already.

1:19:40.965 --> 1:19:43.901
It bought me the time
I needed to recuperate

1:19:43.968 --> 1:19:46.803
so I could save your ass.

1:19:48.873 --> 1:19:50.140
Better.

1:19:51.408 --> 1:19:55.145
But you still
sound like a dweeb.

1:19:55.212 --> 1:19:57.147
You could've mentioned
the immortality.

1:19:58.448 --> 1:20:00.817
I like to keep
people guessing.

1:20:03.754 --> 1:20:05.522
Three aliens.

1:20:05.589 --> 1:20:07.491
The last surviving members

1:20:07.557 --> 1:20:09.826
of each of our people.

1:20:09.894 --> 1:20:13.497
Of course I killed
all my peoples myself.

1:20:13.563 --> 1:20:15.699
So, why do I give a shit?

1:20:20.837 --> 1:20:22.974
Nah.

1:20:23.041 --> 1:20:26.510
Just kidding. You should
have seen your face, though.

1:20:33.517 --> 1:20:36.020
You know those are
just stories, right?

1:20:36.087 --> 1:20:38.056
Every rat bastard I hunt

1:20:38.122 --> 1:20:40.190
is the last of his people.

1:20:40.257 --> 1:20:42.994
Something you say
to keep the bounty high.

1:20:43.061 --> 1:20:46.229
Are you saying there are
other Martians out there?

1:20:46.864 --> 1:20:48.832
Hell yeah!

1:20:48.900 --> 1:20:50.902
Seen 'em myself.

1:20:50.968 --> 1:20:53.670
Might even be
a Kryptonian, or two.

1:20:57.041 --> 1:20:58.642
All right, ladies.

1:20:58.709 --> 1:21:01.445
I gotta take
a big old space dump

1:21:01.511 --> 1:21:03.981
and I don't do it no place
but my own.

1:21:04.048 --> 1:21:05.415
So...

1:21:05.983 --> 1:21:07.784
smell you later!

1:21:15.659 --> 1:21:17.828
I really hope
he doesn't come back.

1:21:20.363 --> 1:21:22.033
You should go.

1:21:22.100 --> 1:21:23.266
Follow him.

1:21:24.367 --> 1:21:25.702
Find your people.

1:21:28.305 --> 1:21:29.840
And you, Kal-El.

1:21:35.812 --> 1:21:37.181
It's Superman.

1:21:37.247 --> 1:21:38.849
My people are right here.

1:21:47.058 --> 1:21:48.358
You...

1:21:48.425 --> 1:21:50.460
You couldn't meet me
over by the stairs?

1:21:50.527 --> 1:21:52.662
We're losing
valuable interview time.

1:21:52.729 --> 1:21:54.798
Sorry, Ms. Lane. Not today.

1:21:56.901 --> 1:21:58.035
Call me to reschedule.

1:22:22.359 --> 1:22:23.827
Way to go, Superman!

1:22:25.963 --> 1:22:27.899
So, how was
the interview, Lois?

1:22:29.666 --> 1:22:31.568
You know what I told you
about power moves, Clark?

1:22:31.635 --> 1:22:33.770
Well, I was right.
They really do work.

1:22:33.837 --> 1:22:35.873
Has anybody
seen my calendar?
