WEBVTT

00:01.343 --> 00:02.790
Here we are girls.

00:03.648 --> 00:05.408
I want to be your friend Bea.

00:06.225 --> 00:08.614
Even though you shopped he to the cops.

00:10.772 --> 00:12.154
What the fuck!

00:12.349 --> 00:17.158
What does it feel like Vera to finally
have everything you've ever wanted?

00:17.213 --> 00:18.614
It's Governor.

00:18.638 --> 00:20.103
I need to know his name.

00:20.128 --> 00:23.708
Niles Jesper. He works for
Ferguson. He's her thug.

00:25.190 --> 00:27.123
- Argh, Vera!
- Chang! Down!

00:27.362 --> 00:29.213
Drugs have always found their way in.

00:29.237 --> 00:31.518
But you are the only leader
who has never trafficked them.

00:31.544 --> 00:34.594
- The women need you.
- But the women want conjugal visits.

00:38.554 --> 00:39.755
(groans)

00:40.460 --> 00:41.661
<i>Argh!</i>

00:42.329 --> 00:46.615
You still think she's a hero?
The abused is now the abuser.

00:47.384 --> 00:49.125
<i>She taking her anti-psychotics?</i>

00:49.149 --> 00:51.530
- <i>No.</i>
- Good. Keep me informed.

00:55.838 --> 00:58.930
In two days this place will be
crawling with press and VIP's.

00:58.956 --> 01:01.587
We need a good news
story. Don't fuck it up.

01:02.271 --> 01:03.471
Oi!

01:03.942 --> 01:05.867

(exhales nervously)

02:09.627 --> 02:11.317
First time in a prison?

02:11.646 --> 02:12.896
Yeah.

02:40.909 --> 02:42.574
- Hi.
- Who are you?

02:42.599 --> 02:45.460
Enrico Pugliese. I'm uh,
Miss Spencer's junior.

02:45.485 --> 02:47.521
- Where's Nina?
- Uh, she's in court.

02:47.546 --> 02:50.727
She apologises and she
sent uh, me instead.

02:50.752 --> 02:53.903
I am paying for the best in the
business. I expect to get it.

02:57.016 --> 03:01.218
Hi Kim. Are you feeling better?

03:01.469 --> 03:04.474
You took Franky away you bitch!

03:04.725 --> 03:06.967
It's okay. We can be left alone.

03:09.396 --> 03:11.638
Ah, it's not good news.

03:12.021 --> 03:13.542
So spit it out.

03:13.951 --> 03:16.811
Well, under the rules of
disclosure the prosecution has

03:16.836 --> 03:19.867
furnished us with a
statement, from Niles Jesper.

03:19.893 --> 03:21.677
In which he denies my involvement.

03:21.703 --> 03:26.538
Uh, well, Mr Jesper has
revised his statement.

03:27.201 --> 03:28.861
He's cut a plea bargain

03:37.161 --> 03:38.387
_

03:39.645 --> 03:40.844
_

03:43.733 --> 03:46.030
Just go away. Fuck off!

03:46.055 --> 03:49.548
But you need to know that Franky
wanted her parole more than anything.

03:50.093 --> 03:51.960
I didn't take her away.

03:53.304 --> 03:55.743
Excuse me guard. Please guard.

04:09.381 --> 04:13.110
Trust in me, you'll never
smell of this. Stupid!

04:13.134 --> 04:16.487
What's the matter with people?
What's the matter with people?

04:16.512 --> 04:23.302
(incoherent crazed mutterings)

04:27.117 --> 04:30.185
Dead men tell no tales.

04:34.290 --> 04:37.920
Yes, I have her psych evaluation
paperwork in front of me.

04:37.946 --> 04:41.098
Uh, look, this patient should not
have been discharged from the hospital.

04:41.725 --> 04:44.707
Mmmm... Can you have Dr Foster call me

04:44.733 --> 04:47.492
and in the meantime
email the clinical notes?

04:47.518 --> 04:48.718
Thank you.

04:55.098 --> 04:56.298
(knock at door)

04:57.185 --> 04:59.877
- Ms Westfall to see you, Governor.
- Send her in.

05:01.608 --> 05:04.326
- We need to talk about Ferguson.
- You are having a relationship

05:04.350 --> 05:05.632
with Franky Doyle.

05:05.975 --> 05:07.591
A former prisoner.

05:07.858 --> 05:09.867
You've compromised yourself
and you've compromised me.

05:09.893 --> 05:12.026
I went out on a limb
to have you reinstated.

05:14.624 --> 05:17.983
The relationship with Franky only
started after she left Wentworth.

05:18.423 --> 05:20.259
She was no longer a client.

05:21.983 --> 05:24.786
I intend to recommend to the board
that you be dismissed immediately.

05:24.788 --> 05:26.266
In the meantime, you should go home.

05:26.292 --> 05:27.492
(exhales)

05:28.303 --> 05:31.382
- I know you feel this is a personal...
- Do not tell me how I feel!

05:35.834 --> 05:37.034
Okay.

05:38.848 --> 05:40.048
You're right.

05:41.490 --> 05:42.691
I deserve that.

05:43.889 --> 05:45.088
One more thing...

05:45.755 --> 05:47.564
If Doyle is living with you...

05:48.393 --> 05:50.591
that would constitute
a breach of her parole.

05:55.615 --> 05:56.814
(door closes)

05:57.723 --> 06:00.317
*** (speaking in foreign language)

06:01.204 --> 06:02.634
You're in the wrong place.

06:02.660 --> 06:04.524
Give it a rest, Kaz.

06:04.524 --> 06:06.571
Shouldn't you have stayed
in the men's prison?

06:06.752 --> 06:10.601
Yeah blokes, red right
hand. Not perfect together.

06:10.627 --> 06:12.634
She said give it a rest.

06:14.829 --> 06:16.485
Didn't think you'd be too far away.

06:16.509 --> 06:17.718
(Bea chuckles)

06:17.742 --> 06:21.187
Ooh, while you're here. You know, if
you want to start something, anything...

06:21.228 --> 06:23.028
you run it by me first, okay?

06:23.052 --> 06:25.497
Sure. Got it Bea.

06:25.829 --> 06:27.509
Check with the boss.

06:27.877 --> 06:29.836
Where's my toothpaste?

06:31.829 --> 06:33.665
Allie's got the hots for you.

06:34.072 --> 06:36.016
Ugh. She's just weird.

06:36.057 --> 06:38.048
Well, that's the vibe I'm pickin' up.

06:38.930 --> 06:40.415
You should use it to your advantage Bea.

06:40.441 --> 06:43.125
- Bea. I'm serious.
- Hey Bea! Hey! Bea!

06:44.023 --> 06:46.108
Hey do you know anything
about the conjugals yet?

06:46.132 --> 06:47.452
- Yeah.
- I've been in the shower,

06:47.478 --> 06:49.639
not gazing into a crystal ball.

06:49.869 --> 06:52.702
Oh, well, could you like
ask the Governor again?

06:52.728 --> 06:54.846
- Yeah.
- 'Cause I'm gettin' desperate.

06:54.872 --> 06:57.204
- Getting?
- Everyone's so excited, eh?

06:57.228 --> 06:59.446
Yeah, they are. (giggling)

06:59.471 --> 07:00.822
Good on ya, Bea.

07:18.086 --> 07:19.867
How would Vera know that?

07:20.125 --> 07:21.922
How would she know anything about us?

07:21.947 --> 07:24.610
I don't know. It seemed pointless
to ask her how she found out.

07:24.636 --> 07:27.629
It's The Freak winding her up.
She's just trying to bluff ya.

07:27.831 --> 07:29.331
You gotta deny everything.

07:29.699 --> 07:32.399
And what's she going to tell them
anyway? The Freak can smell me?

07:32.423 --> 07:35.091
- Franky, listen.
- What is she, a fuckin' beagle?

07:35.115 --> 07:36.316
It's not a bluff.

07:36.935 --> 07:39.713
All right? And I don't want
you getting caught up in this.

07:40.182 --> 07:41.382
What do ya mean?

07:41.731 --> 07:44.165
You gotta pack your stuff
and get back to the bedsit.

07:44.189 --> 07:46.004
- Now.
- You kickin' me out?

07:46.005 --> 07:48.685
If Vera reports you
to your parole officer

07:48.701 --> 07:50.254
and you're not living where
you said you were living

07:50.278 --> 07:51.310
they're going to ship you straight

07:51.334 --> 07:52.903
- back there.
- And I will fuckin' kill her.

07:52.928 --> 07:54.567
- Franky.
- No. Fuck that, Gidge.

07:54.593 --> 07:56.855
I have fought for this and you know.

07:57.504 --> 07:59.497
For the first time I've got a life.

07:59.521 --> 08:02.403
And I gotta girl and
I'm about to start a job.

08:02.466 --> 08:04.290
You've done great, baby.

08:05.012 --> 08:08.096
I'm proud of you but we need
to focus on the practicalities

08:08.122 --> 08:10.035
Why? And let that vindictive
shit take it all away?

08:10.060 --> 08:12.214
It's not just about you Franky.

08:12.216 --> 08:13.932
She thought I was a friend.

08:13.956 --> 08:15.156
(scoffs)

08:15.403 --> 08:16.802
You're defending her.

08:17.786 --> 08:19.139
It's my fault.

08:19.637 --> 08:21.101
I fucked everything up.

08:27.067 --> 08:30.393
Fine. I'm outta here.

08:39.717 --> 08:41.562
Hey... Franky.

08:43.163 --> 08:44.615
What the fuck?

08:45.318 --> 08:46.919
Franky. I need to talk to ya.

08:46.945 --> 08:48.841
Oh yeah, it's great timing Dad.

08:48.866 --> 08:50.624
Hey look. I understand,
all right, I understand.

08:50.649 --> 08:53.167
But look, if-if I could
just give you my number and

08:53.192 --> 08:56.165
when you're ready you can
just give me a call, please.

09:12.192 --> 09:14.568
So what's, ah, happening
with the conjugal visits.

09:14.594 --> 09:16.326
There will be no conjugal visits.

09:16.639 --> 09:17.928
But you said you'd look into it.

09:17.953 --> 09:19.951
And you said there'd be no
trouble at the press event.

09:19.976 --> 09:21.527
I didn't start that trouble.

09:23.157 --> 09:25.610
- Did you even ask Channing?
- Yes.

09:25.821 --> 09:29.857
There is no conjugal visit program
in any women's prisons, because the

09:29.883 --> 09:32.446
department can't afford the pregnancy
and birth related health costs.

09:32.471 --> 09:34.135
Not wants to get pregnant.

09:34.161 --> 09:36.114
It is the perfect antidote for boredom.

09:36.139 --> 09:38.647
They'd be popping them
out like ping pong balls.

09:40.099 --> 09:41.764
According to Mr Channing.

09:41.807 --> 09:44.846
One thing it's safe to say. The women
are going to be pretty pissed off.

09:45.075 --> 09:48.769
Uh, I want you to get involved in
one of the new education programs.

09:48.786 --> 09:50.476
Grooming for Success.

09:53.114 --> 09:54.676
Grooming for Suc...?

09:54.701 --> 09:56.322
(scoffs) Me?

09:56.433 --> 09:57.634
A lifer?

09:57.658 --> 09:59.394
You can teach the women
what you're good at.

09:59.403 --> 10:01.851
What? Murder? Hm?

10:01.876 --> 10:03.153
And hairdressing!

10:04.716 --> 10:06.514
I need to keep the women active.

10:08.216 --> 10:09.481
Excuse me, Governor.

10:09.506 --> 10:10.806
Thank you, Smith.

10:16.254 --> 10:18.120
The Freak is asking to...

10:18.591 --> 10:20.409
Ferguson is asking to see you.

10:30.774 --> 10:32.283
You wanted to see me?

10:32.307 --> 10:35.601
Not particularly, no. It's
Mr Channing I'd like to see.

10:36.509 --> 10:38.119
Mr Channing's not here.

10:38.322 --> 10:39.655
But he will be tomorrow.

10:39.681 --> 10:42.355
When he arrives could you
convey my request for a meeting?

10:43.580 --> 10:45.398
You're a prisoner now.

10:45.696 --> 10:48.837
You don't get to have meetings
with the regional director.

10:48.985 --> 10:50.186
Really?

10:53.173 --> 10:54.373
(general hubbub)

10:56.540 --> 10:58.384
How's little Joshy going at home?

10:58.408 --> 11:01.509
Well, Nash says he's doing fine
but I'm missing him like crazy.

11:01.534 --> 11:03.328
- Course you are.
- Hey. How did it go?

11:03.360 --> 11:05.126
We get the rumpy pumpy time?

11:05.517 --> 11:07.806
All right. Listen up ladies.

11:08.586 --> 11:09.927
Uh...

11:10.283 --> 11:13.554
I'm sorry, but the uh, department
said no to conjugal visits.

11:13.580 --> 11:15.934
- <i>That's bullshit!</i>
- Oh, jeez.

11:15.960 --> 11:17.649
- <i>Why?</i>
- I tried my best.

11:17.650 --> 11:20.067
Well, why didn't Vinegar
Tits fight harder for us?

11:20.092 --> 11:21.330
- Yeah!
- I don't know.

11:21.355 --> 11:25.051
Maybe she didn't appreciate
being pelted with dirty tampons.

11:26.202 --> 11:29.732
Come on. Seriously. We don't
have to put up with this.

11:29.756 --> 11:33.172
If the men at Walford can get
conjugal visits, then so can we.

11:33.344 --> 11:35.368
Some of us might take no for an answer

11:35.393 --> 11:37.946
but I don't and I won't.
Hands up, who wants a root?

11:37.971 --> 11:39.936
<i>- Oh, yeah!
- Whoo!</i>

11:39.961 --> 11:41.600
<i>- Yeah!
- Ah-ha!</i>

11:42.188 --> 11:43.389
Give me the phone.

11:45.914 --> 11:48.040
I don't think she gets
the whole "Top Dog" thing.

11:48.066 --> 11:50.085
Oh, just full of hot air.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.070
She is politically savvy.

11:52.095 --> 11:54.173
She knows how to harness their emotions.

11:54.197 --> 11:55.493
Don't worry Maxine.

11:55.736 --> 11:57.052
I can manage her.

11:58.186 --> 12:00.116
- Can I have that?
- Yeah, it's nice.

12:00.142 --> 12:01.369
(Kaz) <i>Yeah, okay.</i>

12:01.706 --> 12:04.440
<i>I was thinking tomorrow
morning 10:00. Can you do that?</i>

12:05.009 --> 12:06.921
- (knocks)
- Good.

12:07.416 --> 12:08.615
(knocks)

12:09.970 --> 12:11.530
- (knocks)
- Bury that.

12:13.929 --> 12:15.715
They are not going to know what hit 'em.

12:19.886 --> 12:22.354
(train clattering passed in distance)

12:31.754 --> 12:33.620
(echoed indistinct voices)

12:34.537 --> 12:36.537
<i>You treated that girl
like a piece of meat.</i>

12:36.562 --> 12:38.482
<i>I love you Franky.</i>

12:38.500 --> 12:40.298
<i>The only way I'm getting
out of here is in a box.</i>

12:40.322 --> 12:42.813
<i>I suppose you can't help
but self-destruct can you?</i>

12:42.830 --> 12:44.408
<i>You're not that person Franky.</i>

12:44.433 --> 12:45.813
<i>I'm whatever person I need to be.</i>

12:45.837 --> 12:47.759
<i>Please Franky. Please don't go...</i>

12:52.289 --> 12:53.662
All right.

12:54.328 --> 12:55.750
You got my attention.

12:58.392 --> 13:00.102
Don't tell me you're missing this place.

13:00.119 --> 13:02.462
Ugh... what do you reckon?

13:03.313 --> 13:04.514
What are you doing here?

13:05.750 --> 13:06.951
Don't know.

13:07.461 --> 13:08.789
That's the truth.

13:10.813 --> 13:12.958
Hope you're respecting
your freedom, Franky...

13:13.476 --> 13:14.778
you should be.

13:15.423 --> 13:17.783
Yeah. Well, I don't want to
come back here that's for sure.

13:17.844 --> 13:19.123
Well then, scram.

13:19.398 --> 13:20.597
Go home.

Also I suggest housing me
in a unit with the new

her, someone else will.

24:48.573 --> 24:50.234

25:46.450 --> 25:47.736
What? You don't believe me?

25:47.760 --> 25:49.548
I know you were at Wentworth

25:50.530 --> 25:51.922
That is outstanding.

25:52.741 --> 25:53.942
Why?

25:55.507 --> 25:57.224
I mean that's what I came to tell ya.

25:58.530 --> 25:59.730
(sighs)

26:00.304 --> 26:01.598
It's not easy...

26:02.554 --> 26:05.474
after being inside, to know
how to be on the outside.

26:06.500 --> 26:08.493
And I love being free.

26:09.061 --> 26:11.175
But it scares the fuck out of me.

26:12.343 --> 26:14.346
And sometimes like last night...

26:14.365 --> 26:17.631
I feel like it's all gonna get ripped
away, like it's not really mine.

26:19.865 --> 26:22.962
You know, everything
seemed clearer in prison.

26:24.140 --> 26:26.851
And the thought of that was
somehow comforting. So, I went back.

26:28.499 --> 26:29.826
Did it help?

26:32.624 --> 26:34.246
Acknowledging the fear.

26:34.865 --> 26:36.397
Isn't that what you say?

26:38.513 --> 26:40.538
So, I just wanted to tell ya...

26:42.224 --> 26:43.488
Thank you.

27:01.913 --> 27:03.113
Mmmm...

27:08.625 --> 27:10.182
Would you pass the salad?

27:14.538 --> 27:15.805
Oh, and the pepper.

27:23.824 --> 27:25.222
So you got duck eggs?

27:26.159 --> 27:28.660
It's gotta be something The
Freak wants, that's worth the risk.

27:28.675 --> 27:29.992
Or she has a death wish.

27:30.378 --> 27:32.074
Psychopath's aren't suicidal.

27:32.737 --> 27:34.786
They thrive on power.

27:35.246 --> 27:37.267
Yeah but she's got no
power and protection.

27:37.291 --> 27:38.755
There's no one she can manipulate.

27:39.932 --> 27:42.478
Oh-ho-ho-ho... fuck!

27:44.932 --> 27:46.406
She wants to be Top Dog.

27:49.135 --> 27:50.474
Watch out Red.

27:52.292 --> 27:53.492
(chatter)

27:56.405 --> 27:58.701
Oh, are you fucking kidding me?

27:59.240 --> 28:01.518
Hey, give me a sec.

28:05.298 --> 28:06.571
Hey Ellie.

28:07.445 --> 28:08.698
Hey. Come here.

28:09.364 --> 28:10.564
Come on.

28:10.711 --> 28:12.886
What the fuck? Why?

28:12.912 --> 28:14.759
Does it matter why? Fuck off.

28:15.102 --> 28:16.301
(sighs exasperatedly)

28:16.326 --> 28:17.527
Yuck!

28:17.551 --> 28:20.148
- (swears in foreign language)
- (Bea laughing)

28:20.173 --> 28:21.374
Right-o.

28:21.501 --> 28:23.095
Hey, Kaz out of medical yet?

28:23.422 --> 28:24.622
Yeah

28:24.646 --> 28:27.070
Yeah, she's fine now. No
fracture, just a bruise.

28:27.096 --> 28:28.445
Oh. That's good.

28:31.169 --> 28:32.537
Hey I like that colour.

28:34.199 --> 28:36.182
I reckon you'd look better lighter.

28:36.816 --> 28:38.849
- You reckon?
- Yeah.

28:39.316 --> 28:41.431
I could do it for you.
Give you a cut and colour.

28:43.398 --> 28:44.598
All right.

29:08.423 --> 29:10.105
Oh, for fuck's sake.

29:11.018 --> 29:13.077
- You stalkin' me now, are ya?
- No, Franky.

29:13.111 --> 29:14.758
Look. I know you don't
want anything to do with me.

29:14.782 --> 29:16.224
Yeah. That's why I didn't call ya.

29:16.479 --> 29:17.742
You got a sister.

29:22.104 --> 29:23.304
(scoffs)

29:24.618 --> 29:25.913
So when did this happen?

29:26.337 --> 29:27.817
She's three years old.

29:28.712 --> 29:30.940
I thought you had the
right to know each other.

29:33.555 --> 29:35.186
At least know each other exist.

29:40.384 --> 29:43.944
Dr Foster sent over Ferguson's
psychopathy checklist.

29:43.970 --> 29:46.726
I knew she'd manipulated those answers.

29:46.750 --> 29:49.613
Be careful. You're
poking a dangerous spider.

29:50.376 --> 29:52.720
You want her to go back into
the psych hospital, don't you?

29:52.721 --> 29:54.351
Yes. But not at any cost.

30:03.817 --> 30:05.286
How are you today Joan?

30:07.327 --> 30:09.500
I'll feel better when
I move into general.

30:09.525 --> 30:11.202
Yes. That's what I'm here to discuss.

30:11.228 --> 30:14.849
The Governor has asked me to
assess your readiness for general...

30:15.163 --> 30:17.417
from a psychological viewpoint.

30:17.625 --> 30:18.825
Obviously.

30:20.461 --> 30:22.609
I understand it must be
quite boring here for you.

30:23.422 --> 30:26.920
It's an isolation unit. There
is no stimulation whatsoever.

30:26.944 --> 30:32.108
You're not... concerned about
the risk to yourself, physically,

30:32.134 --> 30:33.625
from the other prisoners in general?

30:33.650 --> 30:34.849
Not at all.

30:35.367 --> 30:36.712
And why is that?

30:38.087 --> 30:39.757
It's not obvious to you?

30:41.568 --> 30:43.102
Because you're superior?

30:50.238 --> 30:51.438
Yes...

30:51.462 --> 30:53.462
(loud echoes of pencil on paper)

30:59.795 --> 31:01.949
You're not assessing, you're scoring.

31:02.692 --> 31:04.548
Oh, it's all part of it I'm afraid Joan.

31:05.314 --> 31:06.923
- Can we continue?
- Tell you what.

31:06.948 --> 31:10.895
You ask me a question
and then I'll ask you one.

31:11.070 --> 31:12.441
Quid pro quo.

31:12.595 --> 31:14.226
You know that's not how it works Joan.

31:14.250 --> 31:16.446
I'll start. You had
some free moves already.

31:16.898 --> 31:18.651
What was your favourite childhood game?

31:22.336 --> 31:23.631
All right...

31:24.134 --> 31:26.723
Is there anything you've
never told your parents?

31:28.211 --> 31:30.053
Have you ever been raped?

31:33.634 --> 31:35.653
I'm not answering any of your questions.

31:35.679 --> 31:36.878
You just did.

31:39.427 --> 31:42.903
Now I understand your reluctance to
play. It's a bit close to the bone.

31:44.388 --> 31:47.833
What if I ask you about somebody else?

31:47.939 --> 31:49.457
Vera for example?

31:49.845 --> 31:51.548
What's your opinion of her?

31:52.076 --> 31:55.623
Really, your professional opinion?

31:55.842 --> 31:58.888
Miss Bennett is an
extremely capable Governor.

31:58.927 --> 32:01.726
The media love her and
she is respected by all.

32:02.135 --> 32:04.430
(whispered) Liar, liar, pants on fire.

32:06.413 --> 32:08.343
You know as well as I that she's weak.

32:08.367 --> 32:09.215
(heart beats commence)

32:09.240 --> 32:11.685
She's a pathetic little creature.
She would have languished

32:11.711 --> 32:13.393
upstairs forever as a shitkicker

32:13.417 --> 32:15.263
- had I not mentored her.
- Right.

32:16.499 --> 32:20.153
You'll be fascinated to know
that her only act of courage...

32:20.179 --> 32:22.500
was to euthanise her own mother.

32:22.743 --> 32:24.743
(heart beats continue)

32:26.490 --> 32:28.257
You truly are a cunt.

32:29.340 --> 32:30.619
Thank you.

32:32.369 --> 32:33.569
(heart beats stop)

32:33.595 --> 32:35.827
Of course none of this
recording will be any use to you.

32:36.479 --> 32:38.038
<i>You are recording it.</i>

32:49.369 --> 32:52.430
She memorised indicators.
She recognised keywords.

32:52.454 --> 32:54.304
Knew exactly what I was doing.

32:55.298 --> 32:57.499
(indistinct voice outside office)

32:58.660 --> 33:00.328
We can't use that recording.

33:02.676 --> 33:03.876
No.

33:06.801 --> 33:08.276
You wanted to see Smith, Governor?

33:08.300 --> 33:10.330
- Send her in.
- I'll leave you to it.

33:17.489 --> 33:19.224
A heads up and a request.

33:19.250 --> 33:20.919
Hey, well, you give me the heads up

33:20.943 --> 33:23.279
and I'll see what I can
do about that request.

33:25.732 --> 33:30.105
It is possible that Ferguson will be
released into the general population.

33:32.419 --> 33:33.698
Are you kidding?

33:34.083 --> 33:36.521
It's out of my hands. The
board is making this decision.

33:40.818 --> 33:42.136
And the request?

33:42.162 --> 33:46.657
If she is released. I need an
undertaking she won't be harmed.

33:47.685 --> 33:48.885
Okay, sure.

33:50.162 --> 33:52.544
Maybe I'll just pull a
magic wand out of my arse.

33:52.545 --> 33:55.364
If anything happens to
Ferguson, I'll lose my job.

33:55.388 --> 33:57.773
Ha. Surely it'd be worth it?

33:59.162 --> 34:01.638
Now, I know Ferguson made
your life hell, Smith,

34:02.388 --> 34:03.998
and maybe it's too
early for you to tell,

34:04.022 --> 34:05.467
but I'm a very different governor.

34:05.474 --> 34:08.168
So I'm just supposed
to trust you then? Hmm?

34:08.277 --> 34:09.757
I'm supposed to help you?

34:10.985 --> 34:13.101
The women have embraced my new programs.

34:14.367 --> 34:16.105
I can just as easily take them away.

34:19.766 --> 34:22.297
(indistinct voice from outside office)

34:25.733 --> 34:27.855
What the women want
more than anything...

34:28.280 --> 34:29.809
is the conjugal visits.

34:32.077 --> 34:34.264
So do you think you can
find that magic wand?

34:35.940 --> 34:37.266
The Freak?

34:37.512 --> 34:39.527
Well, I give her one week, Max.

34:39.552 --> 34:41.630
Fuck that. Won't take a week to do it.

34:41.646 --> 34:44.077
Hey! No one's going
to be doing anything.

34:44.739 --> 34:46.201
I made a deal with the Governor.

34:46.295 --> 34:49.092
Ooh, must be some deal to stop
you from takin' out The Freak, hey?

34:49.117 --> 34:50.952
- Yeah.
- I reckon you're gonna be pretty happy.

34:50.976 --> 34:52.713
Well, are you going to
tell us what the deal is?

34:52.739 --> 34:53.938
Yeah.

34:53.963 --> 34:55.164
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

34:55.188 --> 34:58.860
Well, I could but... I'll
let her tell you herself.

34:59.269 --> 35:01.260
I have a brief announcement.

35:01.284 --> 35:03.175
You've sent The Freak to Africa?

35:03.199 --> 35:05.724
- (all laugh loudly)
- Oh, yeah!

35:05.748 --> 35:07.838
(wolf whistles) Hear the Governor out.

35:07.864 --> 35:09.063
Thank you.

35:09.934 --> 35:12.902
After a proposal from Bea Smith,

35:12.927 --> 35:15.574
On behalf of the women I can tell you...

35:16.246 --> 35:18.126
that on a trial basis...

35:18.532 --> 35:20.947
we will be instituting conjugal visits.

35:20.972 --> 35:22.172
(gasps) Ooooh...

35:22.197 --> 35:24.965
- (cheering and clapping)
- <i>Let's go ladies!</i>

35:26.143 --> 35:27.757
- Boom!
- <i>Take a seat!</i>

35:28.376 --> 35:30.001
<i>- Fuck, yeah!
- Tale a seat!</i>

35:30.025 --> 35:34.402
We are the first women's
prison in the country to do so.

35:34.427 --> 35:35.628
(clapping and cheering)

35:36.514 --> 35:38.302
Okay, there is a proviso,

35:38.706 --> 35:42.621
suggested by Smith and agreed
to by the Corrections Service.

35:43.123 --> 35:45.538
Those of you who wish to participate...

35:45.871 --> 35:49.851
must also take part in the contraception
and family planning program.

35:50.190 --> 35:52.762
- <i>Well done, Bea! Woo hoo!</i>
- Huh, what?

35:52.786 --> 35:54.451
<i>- Good work, Bea.
- Thanks, Bea.</i>

35:54.476 --> 35:56.360
<i>You fuckin' little ripper, Bea.</i>

35:56.385 --> 35:59.623
Okay and, um, one more thing
I'd like to let you know about

35:59.648 --> 36:03.304
in addition to the other programs I've
introduced, there is a new one starting

36:03.668 --> 36:06.005
Personal Grooming and Presentation.

36:06.114 --> 36:09.329
The, uh, hairdressing component
will be run by Bea Smith.

36:09.355 --> 36:11.166
Oh, fuck yeah, fuck yeah!

36:11.192 --> 36:13.403
(indistinct discussions)

36:19.097 --> 36:20.657
I can't believe you talked me into this.

36:20.682 --> 36:22.884
It is an insurance
policy until Ferguson's

36:22.909 --> 36:24.791
trial, if she gets
released into general.

36:24.815 --> 36:26.289
I doubt it will last the trial period.

36:26.315 --> 36:28.398
You promised the board, if
you were appointed Governor,

36:28.423 --> 36:30.135
things would run
smoother. And I backed you.

36:30.150 --> 36:32.065
That was before they
sabotaged my efforts

36:32.090 --> 36:34.284
by considering Ferguson's
insane petition.

36:34.309 --> 36:35.621
Just take control...

36:35.737 --> 36:36.963
Jesus!

36:45.179 --> 36:46.719
_

36:48.065 --> 36:49.443
What the fuck.

36:53.260 --> 36:54.909
What sort of prison
are you running here?

36:54.909 --> 36:57.119
That was a threat. We
can't take it lightly.

36:57.121 --> 36:58.503
Tell the board what you witnessed.

36:58.503 --> 37:01.036
What? That you can't
control your prisoners.

37:01.061 --> 37:04.902
This transfer is not my doing. You
have to tell Ferguson it can't happen.

37:05.619 --> 37:06.916
Fuck Vera.

37:07.847 --> 37:10.516
I want to stay as far away
as possible from that bitch.

37:10.541 --> 37:12.610
It is up to you to
close this can of worms

37:12.635 --> 37:14.625
otherwise we will have
a death on our hands.

37:17.023 --> 37:19.009
Those newbies are gonna
freak when they realise

37:19.034 --> 37:21.175
it's me showing them how
to apply make-up. (laughs)

37:21.199 --> 37:23.472
How's Vinegar tits, cheeky bitch.

37:24.378 --> 37:25.978
Is there a wig in that box?

37:27.052 --> 37:28.306
Uhh... it's empty.

37:28.550 --> 37:30.869
God, if it's not bloody
nailed down in this place.

37:30.894 --> 37:32.094
Hey...

37:32.119 --> 37:33.610
Bea look who's here.

37:36.621 --> 37:38.313
I'll have a cut and colour, thanks.

37:40.856 --> 37:42.751

That's your sister. It's Franky.

38:47.456 --> 38:49.157
(squeals and giggles)

38:51.572 --> 38:52.773
(sniffs)

38:54.128 --> 38:55.327
(laughs)

38:57.929 --> 38:59.510
(tearily) It's nice to meet you.

39:07.541 --> 39:08.751
Just so you know...

39:08.777 --> 39:12.038
I am not going to pursue that
matter between you and Doyle.

39:13.356 --> 39:15.755
Ooh. Can I ask why?

39:15.902 --> 39:17.586
It's purely pragmatic.

39:19.552 --> 39:22.130
Your job is secure, as
long as I'm Governor.

39:22.543 --> 39:23.856
However long that might be.

39:23.880 --> 39:26.237
(chuckles) Well, I'm grateful.

39:26.708 --> 39:28.054
For Franky too.

39:28.771 --> 39:29.971
(sighs)

39:30.001 --> 39:31.206
Uh, Bridget?

39:31.231 --> 39:32.431
Hmm?

39:33.536 --> 39:36.079
Those things that Ferguson
had said about me...

39:36.496 --> 39:39.826
- Don't give them another thought.
- No, uh, I wanted to ask...

39:41.987 --> 39:44.170
you don't think that
I'm in any way like her?

39:47.300 --> 39:51.932
The very fact that you can even
ask that question means you're not.

39:53.541 --> 39:55.476
Psychopaths have no fear.

39:57.666 --> 39:58.945
Night, Vera.

39:59.463 --> 40:00.663
Night.

40:08.820 --> 40:11.476
- Hey, spunky.
- Hey, baby.

40:11.547 --> 40:12.746
(chuckles)

40:14.335 --> 40:15.588
(exhales)

40:16.672 --> 40:18.528
- Hey.
- Heya.

40:18.554 --> 40:20.079
Thanks for picking me up.

40:20.101 --> 40:22.405
No sweat. I wanted to.

40:23.038 --> 40:25.869
It's not weird for you, being here?

40:25.992 --> 40:28.217
Well, it's no weirder
than the rest of my life.

40:30.672 --> 40:31.873
You okay?

40:31.898 --> 40:33.097
Yeah, I'm fine.

40:35.778 --> 40:38.331
Just got... I just got
some stuff I gotta sort out.

40:41.034 --> 40:42.672
We're not breaking up are we?

40:42.965 --> 40:44.346
No, defs not.

40:44.722 --> 40:46.461
Phew, you had me worried
there for a minute.

40:50.226 --> 40:51.574
I should move out.

40:52.864 --> 40:54.333
I have to, Gidge.

40:56.534 --> 40:59.083
If I'm ever gonna learn how
to live on the outside...

40:59.873 --> 41:01.969
I need to be able to
stand on my own two feet.

41:04.713 --> 41:06.280
Sounds like a breakthrough.

41:06.632 --> 41:07.960
(laughs)

41:11.184 --> 41:12.385
Mmmm

41:14.056 --> 41:15.255
(cell doors open)

41:27.945 --> 41:29.510
What took you so long?

41:29.865 --> 41:32.539
I've been giving your
petition due consideration.

41:34.094 --> 41:36.047
And I'll be recommending to the board...

41:36.179 --> 41:38.943
not to release you
into general population.

41:40.117 --> 41:41.708
Surely my lawyer's been in touch?

41:41.735 --> 41:44.148
Mm-hmm. And you can
tell her to stop calling

41:44.641 --> 41:46.163
because it's not going to happen.

41:47.632 --> 41:49.670
You seem to have forgotten how

41:49.695 --> 41:53.672
assiduously I have protected your
interests over the past months.

41:54.914 --> 41:57.032
- Joan...
- Derrick.

41:57.054 --> 41:59.469
whatever you think you have
over me you can forget it.

41:59.876 --> 42:02.284
You have discredited
yourself as a witness,

42:02.472 --> 42:03.902
and in the meantime...

42:04.554 --> 42:05.860
I've cleaned house.

42:07.039 --> 42:09.512
If anyone was to investigate
me they'd find nothing.

42:11.130 --> 42:13.382
You know, Derrick, you may
think you've cleaned house,

42:14.530 --> 42:18.119
you may think you have tied
up every loose end, but...

42:20.474 --> 42:21.777
you haven't.

42:24.432 --> 42:25.827
You wanna test it?

42:30.925 --> 42:32.922
Release Ferguson into general.

42:33.152 --> 42:34.838
Give her what she wants.

42:34.862 --> 42:38.483
You saw what the prisoners did.
She won't survive 5 minutes.

42:39.373 --> 42:40.971
Let's hope it's not that long.
