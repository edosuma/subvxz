00:13.800 --> 00:19.000
<i>Edward, King of Wessex, commanded me</i>
<i>to raise his bastard son, Aethelstan.</i>

00:19.080 --> 00:22.760
Protect him and take him to safety.

00:22.840 --> 00:26.760
Teach him how to be a warrior
and all you know of the Danes.

00:26.840 --> 00:30.120
<i>For Aethelstan has rivals</i>
<i>who plot against him.</i>

00:30.200 --> 00:35.480
<i>Edward's father-in-law Aethelhelm is</i>
<i>determined that his own line will prevail</i>

00:35.560 --> 00:39.400
<i>and he stops at nothing to see</i>
<i>his grandson Aelfweard on the throne.</i>

00:39.480 --> 00:42.120
If the king cannot choose
between his sons,

00:42.200 --> 00:45.960
it may be that we need to ensure
his ally, the queen, does not survive.

00:46.760 --> 00:48.960
Mother! Mother!

00:49.040 --> 00:52.840
<i>For many years,</i>
<i>my men and I protected the Mercian border,</i>

00:53.920 --> 00:56.920
<i>where we serve at the pleasure</i>
<i>of the Lady of Mercia.</i>

00:58.640 --> 01:02.960
<i>Aethelflaed has taken</i>
<i>a vow of chastity to rule alone,</i>

01:03.040 --> 01:05.480
<i>although a deep love remains between us.</i>

01:05.560 --> 01:07.960
The price
we are paying is great.

01:08.520 --> 01:11.760
I will miss you, Uhtred Ragnarson.

01:11.840 --> 01:16.040
<i>And she takes great comfort</i>
<i>in her precious child Aelfwynn.</i>

01:16.600 --> 01:21.000
<i>My own daughter Stiorra has made</i>
<i>her bond with Sigtryggr the Dane.</i>

01:21.080 --> 01:22.760
We seek a homeland.

01:22.840 --> 01:26.320
But we do not succumb to anger.

01:26.400 --> 01:30.800
<i>For many years there has been</i>
<i>peace between Saxon and Dane.</i>

01:30.880 --> 01:32.080
<i>And of Brida?</i>

01:32.600 --> 01:35.280
<i>Nothing has been heard</i>
<i>since she fled Winchester.</i>

01:35.360 --> 01:38.400
- My love--

01:38.480 --> 01:41.360
- <i>And gave birth to Cnut's child.</i>

01:43.880 --> 01:47.360
<i>But I fear that her anger</i>
<i>towards me still haunts her.</i>

01:47.440 --> 01:50.000
Blood has been shed. More will flow.

01:50.560 --> 01:53.200
I will take revenge
on all those who have betrayed me

01:53.280 --> 01:56.440
and I will not rest
until they suffer at my hand.

02:01.200 --> 02:02.400
<i>Destiny is all.</i>

02:13.639 --> 02:15.199
<i>Years passed.</i>

02:16.280 --> 02:18.160
<i>And for those years we heard nothing.</i>

02:19.960 --> 02:21.600
<i>No word, no sign.</i>

02:25.160 --> 02:27.240
<i>Just quiet rumors that she had died.</i>

02:29.920 --> 02:31.240
<i>That she was reborn.</i>

02:35.680 --> 02:38.800
<i>I hoped the silence</i>
<i>meant that she had found peace.</i>

02:42.720 --> 02:43.720
<i>Most forgot her.</i>

02:45.200 --> 02:46.040
<i>I did not.</i>

02:50.640 --> 02:55.600
<i>And I knew, in time, she would return.</i>

04:05.200 --> 04:06.680
The reckoning approaches.

04:08.680 --> 04:10.000
The gods are speaking.

04:12.000 --> 04:14.480
They guide the seer to choose amongst you.

04:49.840 --> 04:51.640
The seer has chosen.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.200
We make this sacrifice
to bring good fortune.

05:32.960 --> 05:35.840
Show us the moment is ripe for our voyage.

05:55.280 --> 05:56.320
The waves...

05:56.400 --> 05:57.640
To the waves!

06:23.000 --> 06:24.400
We sail for battle!

06:25.000 --> 06:27.800
Beloved friends, warriors...

06:28.960 --> 06:31.760
the time has come to save our people!

06:38.720 --> 06:40.000
To war!

07:40.120 --> 07:43.640
Hey, hey! I've told you before,
codfish on top of codfish.

08:01.040 --> 08:03.280
Lord? Do you see something?

08:03.360 --> 08:04.200
No.

08:05.440 --> 08:06.800
But something's changed.

08:08.600 --> 08:10.840
The air is rotten.

08:10.920 --> 08:12.680
That could be me eating too much cabbage.

08:15.680 --> 08:19.200
Something feels wrong.
I don't like it.

08:25.240 --> 08:27.240
Lord! Lord!

08:28.240 --> 08:29.840
This one says he can't pay.

08:29.920 --> 08:31.400
Sea raiders robbed me.

08:31.480 --> 08:35.000
Let me guess.
The Great Rognvaldr seized his silver.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.919
He wants to trade the border,
he pays Mercia a toll.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.320
He says you still have to pay!

08:41.400 --> 08:43.559
In coin. No produce.

08:43.640 --> 08:46.760
And no tin from Cornwallum
pretending to be coin.

08:48.360 --> 08:49.360
Iron Lord there.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.400
We have soldiers to feed.
It could be a lean winter.

08:53.480 --> 08:56.480
All the more reason
to celebrate while we can.

08:57.320 --> 08:59.080
It's Blood Month festival.

08:59.640 --> 09:02.880
I need ale and you need
to hump the tall girl from Frisia.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.920
The tall girl from Frisia's too tall.

09:05.440 --> 09:08.640
It's border country, Lord.
You don't get to be too picky.

09:22.760 --> 09:23.960
Aethelstan!

09:26.520 --> 09:28.080
Why have you left your post?

09:28.160 --> 09:31.480
- His first hunt, Lord.
- It's good luck for Blood Month, Uhtred.

09:31.560 --> 09:33.600
You think you're ready
to slaughter a beast?

09:35.720 --> 09:36.560
You know I am.

09:38.720 --> 09:40.480
Aethelstan says he's ready.

09:42.160 --> 09:43.000
What do you say?

09:43.080 --> 09:45.600
- Yes?

09:47.840 --> 09:51.200
- For Blood Month!
- For Blood Month!

09:53.000 --> 09:55.240
Be careful.
The animal will fight to the death.

09:55.320 --> 09:56.680
Or try to hump you.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.400
- Let's go kill the swine! Kill the beast!

10:01.960 --> 10:03.560
- Blood Month!
- Blood Month!

10:03.640 --> 10:07.440
Blood Month!
Blood Month! Blood Month!

10:07.520 --> 10:10.480
Blood Month! Blood Month! Blood Month!

10:10.560 --> 10:13.240
Blood Month! Blood Month! Blood Month!

10:13.320 --> 10:15.680
- Away with you!
- Blood Month!

10:15.760 --> 10:18.600
Blood Month! Blood Month! Blood Month…

10:18.680 --> 10:20.840
Leave him. He's a man now.

10:21.400 --> 10:22.680
I should like to see it.

10:23.720 --> 10:26.760
Lord, I, uh, need a little help.

10:28.720 --> 10:29.920
I'll kill you!

10:31.920 --> 10:33.400
- Come here!
- Swine!

10:35.120 --> 10:35.960
Again?

10:36.040 --> 10:38.200
- Come here, bitch!

10:38.280 --> 10:41.800
- Right! Hey, hey! Easy, easy!
- He's mine! He's mine!

10:41.880 --> 10:44.080
Split it up. Come on. Come on!

10:44.160 --> 10:46.160
Get off me, you dirty whore!

10:46.240 --> 10:48.600
- Why do they fight over you?
- I… I'm…

10:48.680 --> 10:50.040
I've got no idea, Lord.

10:52.120 --> 10:54.160
Finan! Get your arse over here!

10:54.240 --> 10:56.400
It's 'cause all the best men
are spoken for.

10:56.480 --> 10:58.120
Keep the peace!

10:58.800 --> 11:02.160
We're here to secure the border,
not kick the arses of drunk women!

11:02.240 --> 11:03.800
You can kick my arse anytime.

11:06.320 --> 11:08.280
I'm going hunting with the men.

11:09.840 --> 11:10.760
Go on, then.

11:11.800 --> 11:13.360
- Hey!

11:18.080 --> 11:20.040
Here, piggy, piggy!

11:20.640 --> 11:22.440
Here, piggy! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

11:29.640 --> 11:30.880
Woo, woo!

11:30.960 --> 11:33.400
- Ow!
- Aethelstan, you madman, you!

11:33.480 --> 11:36.240
- Piggy, piggy, piggy!

11:37.600 --> 11:40.440
- Aethelstan!

11:40.520 --> 11:41.600
Aethelstan!

12:23.240 --> 12:24.160
Whose men are you?

13:00.600 --> 13:01.680
Finish him!

13:03.200 --> 13:04.400
Come on.

13:14.200 --> 13:15.120
Uhtred!

13:16.000 --> 13:17.160
Uhtred!

13:18.200 --> 13:19.360
Do you hear that?

13:21.360 --> 13:22.560
Uhtred!

13:22.640 --> 13:23.640
Aethelstan!

13:25.040 --> 13:26.200
Bastard?

13:26.280 --> 13:27.400
Aethelstan!

13:32.120 --> 13:33.120
Aethelstan!

13:33.200 --> 13:34.200
Uhtred!

14:01.200 --> 14:03.200
Bastard! Where are you?

14:04.560 --> 14:05.720
How many men?

14:05.800 --> 14:08.520
There were three.
One escaped.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.720
- No sign this way.
- Who were they?

14:11.800 --> 14:12.760
Not from here.

14:13.840 --> 14:15.880
- Are you hurt?
- No.

14:16.480 --> 14:19.040
You took three men... alone?

14:19.120 --> 14:21.360
Yes.

14:21.440 --> 14:22.800
What did I say?

14:25.800 --> 14:26.920
I told you!

14:29.040 --> 14:31.960
Let me go downriver
and fight the sea raiders.

14:32.040 --> 14:34.280
No. You're not ready.

14:35.680 --> 14:38.240
Take him to the alehouse.
Celebrate his victory.

14:38.960 --> 14:41.360
You had us worried there
for a second, boy.

14:43.160 --> 14:44.400
Just a scratch. Come on!

14:47.200 --> 14:50.600
- Tonight we dine in Rumcofa.
- You're the one not ready.

14:57.920 --> 15:00.840
He's still a virgin though!

15:52.840 --> 15:54.720
He will redeem us all!

15:55.600 --> 15:58.280
You must follow. You must read this.

15:59.160 --> 16:02.840
We will all perish. We will all perish.

16:04.160 --> 16:05.800
God! There is one God!

16:06.600 --> 16:11.280
You, lady, redeem your heathen forebears.

16:11.920 --> 16:14.880
Return Jorvik to its Christian heart!

16:15.440 --> 16:17.280
Restore the name of Eoferwic.

16:18.080 --> 16:20.880
Danes, hear me!

16:22.200 --> 16:23.440
There is only one God.

16:29.320 --> 16:31.120
How long can they do this?

16:31.200 --> 16:33.200
Every day the same sermon.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.280
King Edward pays them well.

16:36.880 --> 16:41.160
King Edward steals your people from you.
You are ruler here. Tell them to leave.

16:41.240 --> 16:43.120
And signal that it troubles us?

16:43.200 --> 16:45.440
A worthless fight.

16:46.400 --> 16:51.360
If I am to be provoked, it will take more
than an old man trying to extract coin.

16:52.200 --> 16:56.640
They're not just raising coin.
They poke at our gods.

16:57.320 --> 16:59.200
Our gods can withstand it.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
He's taking your kingdom
one convert at a time.

17:06.560 --> 17:08.240
We're supposed to be at peace.

17:08.320 --> 17:11.680
Yes and the peace means
that we are breeding at twice their speed.

17:11.760 --> 17:15.800
We grow our town.
We build a country for generations.

17:15.880 --> 17:17.839
We ignore old men.

17:17.920 --> 17:21.079
Could we not have them beaten,
just for good measure?

17:21.160 --> 17:24.400
Maybe.
Once they've collected enough silver.

17:24.480 --> 17:26.319
They hide it in the sewers.

17:26.400 --> 17:27.480
Think we do not know.

17:28.400 --> 17:29.839
You accept too much.

17:29.920 --> 17:32.760
- And you too little, my Queen.

17:35.240 --> 17:37.560
Come on, Christian, fight me!

17:38.120 --> 17:40.080
Not all Danes want to keep the peace.

17:41.840 --> 17:42.800
Fight me!

17:42.880 --> 17:46.200
Did Jesus cut your cock off, hm? Fight me!

17:46.280 --> 17:50.480
- Is that my brother Rognvaldr?
- Back from the dead. Once again.

17:51.160 --> 17:53.120
King Sigtryggr!

17:53.200 --> 17:55.000
Show yourself!

17:59.560 --> 18:03.680
The Great Raider Rognvaldr!
Who have you enraged this time?

18:03.760 --> 18:04.600
No one!

18:05.880 --> 18:09.520
I am completely reformed!

18:09.600 --> 18:11.600
A man of peace.

18:12.720 --> 18:14.840
We heard you drowned off Scotland.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.000
That was last year!

18:17.080 --> 18:21.680
I heard you needed a kick in the arse.

18:21.760 --> 18:25.800
Letting Christians roam your lands?

18:25.880 --> 18:27.680
Ignore them. They are harmless.

18:27.760 --> 18:28.800
Am I welcome?

18:33.560 --> 18:35.080
I will warn the serving women.

18:39.480 --> 18:40.640
You're welcome.

18:46.920 --> 18:48.480
Jesus loves you!

19:03.880 --> 19:04.720
Wolland!

19:06.640 --> 19:07.520
Did you miss me?

19:12.720 --> 19:15.680
- Let's get him to bed.
- Prepare the chamber with no fire.

19:15.760 --> 19:18.160
- That should keep his visit short.
- Bring him in!

19:19.360 --> 19:20.800
Why has he come back now?

19:20.880 --> 19:25.600
Hella, if he tries anything this time,
I will cut his hands off myself.

19:25.680 --> 19:28.960
Thank you, Lady. You are good to us.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.560
Make it known that there will be a curfew

19:35.640 --> 19:38.040
until the visit
of the Lady of Mercia is over.

19:38.120 --> 19:39.560
Lord, it is Blood Month.

19:39.640 --> 19:41.640
Yes, they will have to hump each other
in daylight.

19:41.720 --> 19:45.200
Why the caution? They were just
sea raiders trying their luck upriver.

19:45.280 --> 19:47.320
- They could have attacked anyone.
- But they did not.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.480
They chose the eldest son
of the King of Wessex.

19:49.560 --> 19:53.240
Who actually knows that? Up here,
he's more arseling than aetheling.

19:53.320 --> 19:54.760
- Perhaps.

19:54.840 --> 19:57.240
Perhaps they were just raiders
in search of coin, perhaps not.

19:57.320 --> 20:00.040
There've been signs. The air has changed.

20:00.120 --> 20:02.560
Well, that is definitely a bad sign.

20:02.640 --> 20:04.440
Yes. When Aethelflaed
comes for the festival,

20:04.520 --> 20:06.440
she's bringing us a priest,
a Father Benedict.

20:06.520 --> 20:09.720
Lodge them near the cornfield, show them
the East Well, and hide the strong ale.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.440
But it's the festival.

20:12.520 --> 20:15.800
She thinks Rumcofa
shames Mercia with its heathen ways.

20:15.880 --> 20:19.800
Uhtred! A ship, it's turned in
from the sea, which we cannot identify.

20:22.800 --> 20:24.400
Then the soldiers will be ready.

20:25.080 --> 20:27.440
Why would anyone attack
before the lady arrives?

20:27.520 --> 20:29.520
Line the riverbank. Prepare.

20:39.960 --> 20:40.800
Whoa.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.480
Right, come on. Move.

20:51.640 --> 20:53.640
It's Rognvaldr come to slaughter.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.840
Will you stop?
You'll unsettle all the men.

20:55.920 --> 20:57.400
Rognvaldr is nothing.

20:58.080 --> 21:02.320
- He's just a coward who buys reputation.
- Trust us. We've fought a lot of Danes.

21:31.480 --> 21:34.040
Am I mistaken, or is that Eadith?

21:41.400 --> 21:45.240
We are travelers and traders!
Happy to pay the toll!

21:55.480 --> 21:59.760
- Hindr. Look after your sister.

21:59.840 --> 22:01.920
Hey, hey,
don't let the chickens run away.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.240
- You remember Osferth.

22:04.320 --> 22:05.160
Yes.

22:06.240 --> 22:07.960
And that little one is Aethelstan.

22:08.600 --> 22:09.640
Surely not!

22:10.120 --> 22:12.280
Oh, you were a very solemn child.

22:12.360 --> 22:14.680
- Yes, he beat it out of me.
- Thank you.

22:14.760 --> 22:18.000
Cynlaef.
Those two are always up to no good.

22:18.080 --> 22:22.080
- Go and annoy Uncle Finan.
- Sidgeflaed, who's married to Sihtric.

22:22.160 --> 22:24.000
- Hello.
- Just call me Sig.

22:24.080 --> 22:27.920
And all the little Sigs
and Sihtrics that populate this town.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.320
- Oh, my God.
- And this is Ingrith.

22:30.400 --> 22:31.680
Finan's wife.

22:31.760 --> 22:33.920
- Eadith.
- I have heard of you.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.640
- What brings you to Rumcofa?

22:36.720 --> 22:39.720
I have learned much in Frankia
in the ways of healing.

22:40.280 --> 22:42.480
And I hear Rumcofa
is riddled with disease.

22:42.560 --> 22:44.240
Oh, that's all Osferth's work.

22:45.720 --> 22:47.160
So, uh, no husband, then?

22:47.240 --> 22:49.120
No. No, my silver's all my own.

22:49.200 --> 22:51.120
Hey, I'd watch yourself.

22:51.200 --> 22:54.320
Our turds have baffled every healer
from here to Frisia.

22:54.400 --> 22:56.200
- You're telling me!

22:56.280 --> 23:00.160
- Hey!

23:00.240 --> 23:01.840
Not on your child!

23:02.720 --> 23:06.360
Eadith, tell me, what were they like
before we civilized them?

23:06.440 --> 23:09.600
Much the same. This one less so perhaps.

23:09.680 --> 23:12.400
Is the king really happy with his son
living among soldiers?

23:12.480 --> 23:13.720
We tend not to mention that.

23:13.800 --> 23:16.520
- No shame in being a bastard boy.
- Whoa!

23:16.600 --> 23:18.360
Yes, much has changed.

23:18.440 --> 23:22.200
- No. Uhtred's still the same.
- What?

23:22.280 --> 23:23.520
He's not married either.

23:39.280 --> 23:40.960
Escort them to the lodging house.

23:41.920 --> 23:44.480
And do not get into any fights
with any young monks.

23:46.680 --> 23:49.000
It's not my reputation men wish to test.

23:49.080 --> 23:51.760
I trained you for battles,
not for ale yard brawls.

23:52.640 --> 23:55.160
Look, I know you seek
to protect me.

23:55.240 --> 23:58.840
I know that, but you were sworn
to protect a child and I'm not.

24:00.120 --> 24:02.080
Yet I made a promise
to your father, the king.

24:02.160 --> 24:04.800
So, only a king can relieve me
of that oath.

24:05.760 --> 24:07.000
Our bond holds fast. Go.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.120
Pleasant surprise.

24:17.520 --> 24:18.600
- Hm?
- Eadith.

24:20.840 --> 24:23.720
Though I'm wary of surprises
so close to Aethelflaed's visit.

24:24.320 --> 24:26.840
Eadith is a… friend.

24:26.920 --> 24:28.160
People can change.

24:28.240 --> 24:32.040
The attack on Aethelstan...
I do not think it was chance.

24:32.120 --> 24:34.480
Someone trying to get rid of him
now he's of age?

24:34.560 --> 24:37.680
- Maybe just someone trying to frighten me.
- And are you frightened?

24:37.760 --> 24:38.920
No. But I expect worse.

24:41.360 --> 24:42.840
Lord, you're brooding.

24:43.800 --> 24:47.000
My wife thinks it's the change
of the seasons getting to you.

24:47.080 --> 24:50.840
We have scouts at every lookout point
from here to the burh at Thelwall.

24:53.120 --> 24:56.320
Hey, hump the tall girl.

25:12.480 --> 25:14.400
Has he finally revealed what he wants?

25:15.720 --> 25:19.800
Not yet. He is still boasting
of his escape from the sea.

25:21.320 --> 25:26.160
- He says the gods sent men to save him.
- He always has a tale to tell.

25:26.240 --> 25:29.000
Do you know he pays sailors
to say they fear him?

25:29.080 --> 25:31.400
Better a lying rogue
than a killer.

25:32.480 --> 25:33.400
You're too tender.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.240
Send him on his way.

25:35.320 --> 25:38.160
And break an oath of hospitality, my love?

25:47.840 --> 25:50.120
Wake up! You're in Valhalla!

25:52.480 --> 25:54.440
Wolland, get him to bed.

26:03.760 --> 26:04.800
Time for sleep.

26:09.600 --> 26:12.120
Stop.
We do not want to see your arse.

26:12.600 --> 26:14.400
She's cold, your woman.

26:19.680 --> 26:23.600
We should set to feasting alone,
talk as kin.

26:25.760 --> 26:28.880
I have learned much since last I saw you.

26:30.240 --> 26:31.440
Changed myself.

26:33.280 --> 26:35.120
Things have happened to me.

26:37.360 --> 26:41.000
The gods chose to save me.

26:43.800 --> 26:46.120
We are never divided at feasting.

26:49.960 --> 26:51.280
We will feast, you and I.

26:54.800 --> 26:59.320
When you are sober, we will feast, hm?

27:08.600 --> 27:11.080
Why do you agree
when he seeks to come between us?

27:13.160 --> 27:14.160
Stiorra.

27:16.760 --> 27:20.360
What he suffered,
when I left him alone in Irland…

27:21.880 --> 27:24.600
...you too would have
a spirit broken.

27:24.680 --> 27:27.040
He boasts because the gods
have not favored him.

27:28.840 --> 27:30.320
That doesn't mean you should.

27:31.960 --> 27:34.920
He is my brother and so I honor him.

27:35.480 --> 27:37.600
For all his faults, our blood is shared.

27:39.840 --> 27:41.400
Blame the Christians.

27:41.480 --> 27:44.280
- They have spoken too much of forgiveness.

29:27.880 --> 29:28.920
Uh…

29:29.000 --> 29:30.760
Oh, were you expecting a rather tall girl?

29:30.840 --> 29:31.800
Yes!

29:31.880 --> 29:34.960
She asked me to exchange rooms
because this bed was too short.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.920
- That would explain it.
- Yes. Ooh!

30:13.000 --> 30:15.560
Keep at your right hand
the souls of kings.

30:16.200 --> 30:20.360
Alfred, known as the Wise,
and Aethelred of Mercia.

30:21.800 --> 30:24.720
Bless my daughter, Aelfwynn of Mercia.

30:25.640 --> 30:28.200
May she learn to resist temptation.

30:31.000 --> 30:34.160
I pray for my brother, the King of Wessex.

30:34.240 --> 30:36.600
Guide him well and hear my entreaty

30:36.680 --> 30:40.200
on behalf of my mother, Aelswith,
wife to Alfred.

30:40.280 --> 30:43.200
Why are you praying for me?
What do you think is wrong with me?

30:43.280 --> 30:45.960
I do not think anything
is wrong with you. I--

30:46.040 --> 30:49.440
- Does it look white?
- No, Mother, it looks quite normal.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.640
- This breeze will stiffen my neck.

30:53.720 --> 30:56.080
Lord knows what ailments
lurk within Rumcofa.

30:56.160 --> 30:58.200
Perhaps we should return to Aegelesburg?

30:59.320 --> 31:02.360
Uh, the Lord wants us
in Rumcofa for festival.

31:02.960 --> 31:05.160
Which Lord? Lord Uhtred?

31:07.320 --> 31:10.320
- Do not fight her, it wastes your time.

31:11.320 --> 31:12.720
Is something wrong with you?

31:12.800 --> 31:15.200
No, Mother. I am just stiff from riding.

31:19.200 --> 31:21.760
Lord Aldhelm, Father Benedict...

31:22.640 --> 31:25.720
Ready to bring the faith
to this dark corner of our land?

31:27.400 --> 31:29.600
Where you lead, we follow, Lady.

31:35.640 --> 31:38.480
- In you get!

31:38.560 --> 31:41.280
Are these people
heading for Rumcofa?

31:41.360 --> 31:43.160
Blood Month is wild in these parts.

31:44.280 --> 31:47.960
That's why Lady Aethelflaed wants to find
a way to make it more Christian.

31:50.040 --> 31:52.040
Well, it falls near Martinmas.

31:53.080 --> 31:55.240
Perhaps we could enlighten them.

31:57.480 --> 32:00.040
They would talk in Rome
of these Northern tribes

32:00.120 --> 32:02.600
that they could be resistant.

32:03.600 --> 32:05.800
Is the reputation deserved?

32:07.600 --> 32:10.560
The lady is fond of both you
and of Rumcofa.

32:11.360 --> 32:14.160
She will not place you
somewhere you would not thrive.

32:37.440 --> 32:38.280
Uhtred!

32:44.760 --> 32:46.000
Lady Aethelflaed is arriving.

33:00.160 --> 33:02.880
- So, that's your cousin?

33:02.960 --> 33:06.040
Yes. Go and help the Lady Aelfwynn
off her horse.

33:06.120 --> 33:06.960
Of course.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.080
Lady Aelfwynn, I'm Cynlaef.

33:18.440 --> 33:21.440
I was sorry to miss you
on our last visit south. I was--

33:21.520 --> 33:25.080
You were making a treaty
with the Scots, I know. Important.

33:25.160 --> 33:26.400
Yes, it was.

33:27.520 --> 33:29.520
Still, the timing was unfortunate.

33:32.880 --> 33:37.480
Not much has changed here in two summers.
The soldiers thrive, so does the town.

33:38.080 --> 33:39.960
Occasional raids, much trade.

33:41.560 --> 33:45.880
- And you look well.
- That's life in the open air.

33:46.520 --> 33:48.000
Perhaps I should try it.

33:48.520 --> 33:51.360
- The Witan like to talk.
- You still look beautiful.

33:54.240 --> 33:55.800
Behold our gift.

33:58.600 --> 34:00.960
Rumcofa does not need a priest.

34:01.040 --> 34:03.960
No, but Father Benedict
needs a new place to preach.

34:04.040 --> 34:05.720
- Did he hump someone?
- No.

34:06.400 --> 34:09.760
No, nothing like that.
He's an exceptionally gifted scholar.

34:09.840 --> 34:14.000
He's a gambler.
He gambled all his alms money in Rome.

34:14.080 --> 34:19.400
- Then in Canterbury. Then with us.
- So put him where he can do no damage?

34:23.480 --> 34:24.639
Welcome to our chapel.

34:31.320 --> 34:34.920
Aethelflaed, look.
Look how fine he has become.

34:35.560 --> 34:37.560
Is he not the image of his father?

34:38.600 --> 34:41.719
You have the light of prayer
shining through you.

34:41.800 --> 34:43.600
And quite the swordsman now, I hear.

34:44.199 --> 34:45.960
Is it true you were attacked?

34:46.040 --> 34:50.560
By raiders, yes, but I'm being
sent to fight them on the seas.

34:52.000 --> 34:52.880
No, he's not.

34:54.719 --> 34:57.000
Lady Aelswith, how's your stomach?

34:58.000 --> 35:02.920
I survive, but still, I should like us
to avoid too many commoners.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.080
For fear of passing them
my many afflictions.

35:09.320 --> 35:10.360
Aelfwynn!

35:17.400 --> 35:20.240
Lady Aelswith remains cautious
in matters of health.

35:22.400 --> 35:25.680
- Lady Aelfwynn.
- Lord Uhtred.

35:25.760 --> 35:26.840
Is the border secure?

35:28.160 --> 35:31.200
Yes. Aethelstan... was just thieves.

35:31.280 --> 35:32.480
Still, we're concerned.

35:32.560 --> 35:35.760
Uh, we've heard of a raider
plundering at sea, a Rognvaldr.

35:35.840 --> 35:38.600
Rognvaldr is not a threat.
He's a boastful turd.

35:38.680 --> 35:40.240
Ask his brother Sigtryggr.

35:40.320 --> 35:42.560
We will not be seeking
the word of Sigtryggr.

35:42.640 --> 35:45.840
- Not concerning Danes on the border.
- Why? The alliance has held.

35:45.920 --> 35:47.880
Uhtred, we know Sigtryggr
is family to you,

35:47.960 --> 35:50.280
but that does not mean
Mercia has to trust him.

35:51.000 --> 35:54.040
This Rognvaldr harries north of our coast.
We fear he may strike--

35:54.120 --> 35:58.000
Sigtryggr will not allow him to cause
real trouble. He extracts coin, no more.

35:58.080 --> 36:00.600
Tell that to the widows
of the men that we've lost.

36:00.680 --> 36:02.320
Thirty of them off the coast
of Cumbraland.

36:02.400 --> 36:06.000
Men massacred and not for silver,
but to avenge the gods, they said.

36:06.640 --> 36:08.680
I have to be more wary of the Dane.

36:09.720 --> 36:12.880
Heathen threat. I know many Danes
live here in Rumcofa in peace.

36:12.960 --> 36:14.680
Live in peace, trade, marry our men.

36:14.760 --> 36:17.160
- The Danes are no danger here.
- But this Dane is.

36:17.880 --> 36:19.800
Maybe we know things you do not.

36:19.880 --> 36:22.760
These past weeks,
there have been stories, mutilations.

36:22.840 --> 36:25.160
Raiders seen with white marking
on their faces.

36:26.160 --> 36:28.360
I do not think
that is the work of Rognvaldr.

36:28.440 --> 36:30.840
They may speak it of him,
but that does not make it true.

36:30.920 --> 36:31.760
Who then?

37:07.560 --> 37:10.960
We have received no word
of mourning from Rumcofa.

37:11.040 --> 37:13.440
Yes. It did not quite work out.

37:13.520 --> 37:16.600
- Does Aethelstan live?
- He was a tough little bastard.

37:16.680 --> 37:18.000
Did you try?

37:20.320 --> 37:21.640
I lost two of my best men.

37:23.280 --> 37:24.200
Don't blame me.

37:25.120 --> 37:29.880
Blame Uhtred of Bebbanburg. If you have
the silver, I can try something else.

37:29.960 --> 37:33.440
I hear the lad can be provoked
into a scrap in an alehouse.

37:36.520 --> 37:37.880
Mm-mm. No.

37:38.440 --> 37:41.720
No, it's too soon.
I'll call on you when I'm ready.

37:43.480 --> 37:46.360
In the meantime, find out what is said

37:46.440 --> 37:49.560
among the common people
of my grandson Aelfweard?

37:53.120 --> 37:54.480
No one speaks of him, Lord.

37:54.560 --> 37:58.280
Then spread his name. For his protection.

37:59.160 --> 38:02.160
I have seen enough to know
that when two boys have one claim,

38:03.240 --> 38:04.560
both cannot thrive.

38:13.600 --> 38:14.520
Where am I next?

38:14.600 --> 38:17.320
The ambassadors
from the Duchy of Lotharingia.

38:17.400 --> 38:18.240
Oh.

38:18.800 --> 38:22.960
I can make an excuse, but you'd have
to meet a visionary from Lewes.

38:23.640 --> 38:25.920
She saw St. Cuthbert in a cabbage patch.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.440
What? Ambassadors it is.

38:32.120 --> 38:35.200
She looks like
she's hawking fishes in Cheap Street.

38:35.280 --> 38:36.440
Lord King.

38:37.480 --> 38:39.160
The queen is playing matchmaker.

38:40.320 --> 38:44.280
She is keen that her sisters find husbands
that will do you honor, Lord King.

38:44.360 --> 38:45.240
Mm.

38:45.320 --> 38:48.600
Will you be introducing them
to Aelfweard as the aetheling?

38:48.680 --> 38:51.800
- And why would I do that?
- My grandson is coming of age.

38:51.880 --> 38:55.600
It would signal abroad
that your dynasty is prepared.

38:55.680 --> 38:58.600
And alarm people
by mooting the succession.

38:59.160 --> 39:01.560
No, I'm still a young man myself.

39:02.640 --> 39:06.840
Aelfweard, introduce Lord Aethelhelm
to the guests on my behalf.

39:06.920 --> 39:10.440
Explain he is a respected elder
of the family.

39:10.520 --> 39:12.240
Yes, Father. Of course.

39:12.320 --> 39:14.760
I'm sure they'll love your stories
from the old days.

39:14.840 --> 39:19.200
Well, perhaps I should advise her
on making suitable alliances.

39:19.280 --> 39:24.080
Indeed. There's nothing worse than being
landed with a spouse you come to detest.

39:36.240 --> 39:37.320
Welcome.

39:39.400 --> 39:40.240
Please.

39:43.760 --> 39:45.080
My darling boy.

39:47.200 --> 39:50.400
Did you suggest that Aelfweard
be introduced as aetheling?

39:51.160 --> 39:53.280
Yes. Uh, he refused.

39:53.920 --> 39:58.200
And the other aspect of our plan
has become problematic.

39:59.360 --> 40:00.760
Aethelstan fought back.

40:01.720 --> 40:02.920
Of course.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.960
'Cause they are training him to become
a killer who will one day come for us.

40:06.040 --> 40:07.120
Calm yourself.

40:07.960 --> 40:12.040
All of Wessex
favors Aelfweard as aetheling.

40:12.960 --> 40:16.440
That will sway things if there is
any contention in the matter.

40:18.360 --> 40:22.200
For now the king looks more
to other women every day.

40:22.280 --> 40:24.200
Ah, I shall remove her.

40:25.280 --> 40:27.000
Like you removed Lady Aelswith?

40:27.080 --> 40:28.480
Lady Aelswith's…

40:28.560 --> 40:30.760
…strong constitution

40:31.520 --> 40:33.920
is a blessing to us all.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.600
My grandfather, Lord Aethelhelm.

40:45.720 --> 40:46.760
You have recovered.

40:49.320 --> 40:54.720
Indeed, and my regret if I broke
the conditions of my welcome.

40:54.800 --> 40:57.040
I am sworn from ale these days, but…

40:57.120 --> 40:58.120
- …sometimes--

40:58.200 --> 40:59.280
What is it you want?

41:00.640 --> 41:01.520
Stiorra.

41:01.600 --> 41:05.840
He only visits when he wants something.
Make your demands and then leave us be.

41:06.440 --> 41:09.080
You are right. She sees everything.

41:10.960 --> 41:13.440
I seek safe harbor for some of my people.

41:14.360 --> 41:17.400
They have been accused of raiding
and, I believe, unfairly.

41:17.480 --> 41:20.600
I wish for them to prove
their innocence here, under Danelaw.

41:20.680 --> 41:21.800
And I have agreed.

41:24.040 --> 41:26.880
I will send out Wolland
with some guard to bring them in,

41:26.960 --> 41:28.520
ensure they cause no trouble.

41:30.680 --> 41:31.760
As you command, Lord.

41:34.960 --> 41:37.680
The Saxons always look for reasons
to make incursions.

41:37.760 --> 41:40.760
This will show them
that our borders must be respected

41:40.840 --> 41:43.160
and that we govern here
with justice under the law.

41:43.240 --> 41:46.360
Mm. And remind the Christians
you're not to be moved.

41:47.880 --> 41:52.120
And that we intend to rule here
for many years to come.

43:09.920 --> 43:11.160
My lady, a dance?

43:15.640 --> 43:17.240
Why so troubled?

43:18.000 --> 43:19.880
I wish you had stayed in Aegelesburg.

43:20.440 --> 43:22.720
And miss Blood Month festival? Never.

43:22.800 --> 43:24.520
You did not come for the festival.

43:26.960 --> 43:29.720
What did you come for?
What is here that is not there?

43:31.200 --> 43:32.760
Some say I came to see you.

43:35.080 --> 43:37.360
I wish that were true,
but I think it is not.

43:40.600 --> 43:44.040
- Is there a threat to you I should know?
- No more than the usual.

43:44.680 --> 43:45.800
You're certain?

43:45.880 --> 43:49.840
Yes.
Besides, you have protected us well here.

43:49.920 --> 43:52.160
You have scouts on the bankside
and on every road.

43:53.040 --> 43:55.640
We would not lie about a threat
to me or to Rumcofa.

43:57.720 --> 44:00.480
- Ready?

44:04.480 --> 44:08.240
- He's not going to say prayers, is he?
- I just asked for a few simple words.

44:10.800 --> 44:15.000
And in this moment,
Rumcofa came under God!

44:17.880 --> 44:20.720
It may be harder than that
to douse the pagan flame.

44:20.800 --> 44:24.200
…virgin and mother,
for these pigs…

44:24.280 --> 44:28.200
- …and these chickens, Gods!

44:30.280 --> 44:32.120
Make sure he gives that back.

44:32.680 --> 44:38.600
We pray for fertility, the rising of sun,
the waxing of the moon…

44:38.680 --> 44:42.200
Why did he choose
the<i> Lorica of Loding?</i>

44:42.720 --> 44:44.720
We shall catch our deaths in this draft.

44:44.800 --> 44:47.360
Just smile and wait for it to pass.

44:47.440 --> 44:49.600
…defend me
on every side.

44:49.680 --> 44:53.480
Skull, head, hair and eyes,

44:54.520 --> 44:56.200
mouth, tongue...

44:56.800 --> 44:58.960
teeth and their covering.

44:59.960 --> 45:02.760
- Neck, breast, side.

45:02.840 --> 45:05.000
For the crown of my head with its hair,

45:05.080 --> 45:08.320
be thou the helmet of salvation
on the head.

45:09.200 --> 45:10.160
Yes!

45:10.600 --> 45:13.800
For forehead, eyes, nostrils...

45:15.280 --> 45:16.480
bowels…

45:17.640 --> 45:18.560
Waist!

45:19.440 --> 45:20.920
Oh, please.

45:21.520 --> 45:27.400
For my limbs, for my entrails,
thou mayest thrust back from me

45:27.480 --> 45:30.280
the invisible nails of stakes.

45:31.440 --> 45:34.280
Eyes, triform brain...

45:36.240 --> 45:40.840
nose, face, teeth, the chin…

45:40.920 --> 45:43.800
- …beard, eyebrows, ears, cheeks.

45:45.040 --> 45:47.400
Make way! Move!

45:47.480 --> 45:48.680
Stand back!

45:49.440 --> 45:50.560
Who is it?

45:55.360 --> 45:58.280
Who is it? Children, stay back.

46:07.440 --> 46:08.480
Father…

46:14.480 --> 46:17.000
- Help him!
- Who did this to you? Rognvaldr?

46:20.280 --> 46:21.120
Brida.

46:23.600 --> 46:26.400
Find her. Find her.

46:27.280 --> 46:29.080
Raise the alarm... now!

46:30.240 --> 46:31.080
Son.

46:33.400 --> 46:34.240
My son.

46:38.120 --> 46:41.360
Lord Jesus Christ, in a rich man's house.

46:41.440 --> 46:45.720
A fallen woman cried
as she dried his feet…

46:55.800 --> 46:57.760
Why allow your people to be converted?

46:59.520 --> 47:05.400
Why not keep Daneland for Danes?
Is it because of your wife?

47:08.520 --> 47:10.840
Since when have you cared so much
for the gods?

47:12.120 --> 47:15.240
I told you, much has changed
this last year.

47:17.920 --> 47:20.960
I was close to death
and not for the first time.

47:22.240 --> 47:26.840
- I am sorry that you suffered.
- But this time, I was reborn.

47:28.280 --> 47:30.520
The gods sent men to my rescue.

47:31.680 --> 47:33.240
They took to a land of fire.

47:34.360 --> 47:40.960
And there I learnt how to be loyal
to them and to my people.

47:45.120 --> 47:46.720
But you do not care for loyalty.

47:49.720 --> 47:53.320
He blesses you and the Lord Jesus.

47:55.200 --> 47:58.320
Have these missionaries sent
back to Wessex tomorrow. That's enough.

47:59.000 --> 48:00.320
Lord, yes, Lord.

48:04.720 --> 48:07.760
I… But I…
I speak here every night.

48:07.840 --> 48:09.520
We've always been allowed to preach here.

48:25.640 --> 48:28.080
You are too accepting of enemies.

48:28.840 --> 48:30.160
No, I am not.

48:30.240 --> 48:33.480
It is more difficult to live peacefully
with enemies than to fight them.

48:38.000 --> 48:38.880
Do you pity me?

48:42.160 --> 48:44.520
I think you suffer without my guidance.

48:51.760 --> 48:52.640
That is Wolland.

48:53.440 --> 48:55.960
Show me those who follow you.
This can be resolved.

49:09.040 --> 49:10.080
My Lord!

49:26.320 --> 49:27.320
Sigtryggr!

49:37.000 --> 49:38.240
Sigtryggr!

49:39.600 --> 49:40.800
Open the gates.

50:11.440 --> 50:12.600
Are these your people?

50:12.680 --> 50:14.000
What do you want?

50:17.440 --> 50:20.240
Not mine. Hers.

50:20.920 --> 50:23.200
All Danes, all pure.

50:28.440 --> 50:30.920
Do not be afraid, brother.
She's here to save us.

50:32.000 --> 50:34.320
- Where are my men?

50:34.400 --> 50:35.920
Where are my men?!

50:36.000 --> 50:37.600
Valhalla!

51:14.680 --> 51:17.680
Danes of Jorvik who turned to Christ...

51:18.360 --> 51:21.840
we are here to return you to the gods!

51:29.200 --> 51:31.920
No, Lady, do not fight. Hide.

51:59.960 --> 52:01.040
Where is she?

52:02.240 --> 52:04.520
Find Stiorra, find Uhtred's daughter.

52:16.520 --> 52:17.560
Brida!

52:19.000 --> 52:20.680
We're ready for you!

52:22.440 --> 52:23.520
Brida!

52:32.640 --> 52:34.320
Brida!
