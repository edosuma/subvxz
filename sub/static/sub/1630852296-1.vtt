00:04.004 --> 00:06.789
- The auto industry
is changing.

00:06.832 --> 00:09.487
Payne Motors has been
making cars for 100 years,

00:09.531 --> 00:12.055
but until now,
all our CEOs have been men

00:12.099 --> 00:13.839
and members
of the Payne family.

00:13.883 --> 00:15.145
- Well, I didn't want the job.

00:15.189 --> 00:16.364
- They didn't offer
you the job.

00:16.407 --> 00:17.495
- Because they knew
I didn't want it.

00:17.539 --> 00:20.107
- Anyway, today we are--
- You can sit.

00:20.150 --> 00:21.543
I don't need, like,
a whole big intro.

00:21.586 --> 00:23.023
- I just had a little bit--
-

00:23.066 --> 00:24.415
I just wanna
keep things moving.

00:24.459 --> 00:27.157
All right,
so someone bring me up to speed

00:27.201 --> 00:29.029
on this self-driving car
that we are announcing.

00:29.072 --> 00:30.813
- Yes.

00:30.856 --> 00:33.859
The Ponderosa will be Payne's
first fully autonomous vehicle.

00:33.903 --> 00:35.165
It has seven key innovations--

00:35.209 --> 00:36.688
- I don't wanna
interrupt your flow.

00:36.732 --> 00:39.213
I just have one question,
the name Ponderosa,

00:39.256 --> 00:42.259
do we like it?

00:42.303 --> 00:44.827
- It tested well.
- Really?

00:44.870 --> 00:48.004
Yeah, to me, it sounds like
ponderous, like dull,

00:48.048 --> 00:50.398
you know,
like a dull, ponderous car.

00:50.441 --> 00:52.400
- It comes from
the Ponderosa pine tree.

00:52.443 --> 00:53.749
- Do people wanna drive a tree?

00:53.792 --> 00:55.490
- We're not saying
that it is a tree.

00:55.533 --> 00:57.405
It's just, like, a vibe.
- Yeah.

00:57.448 --> 01:00.538
There's also the Ponderosa
lemon and the Ponderosa snails.

01:00.582 --> 01:02.149
- But aren't snails like
the slowest animal,

01:02.192 --> 01:03.846
and also a lemon?

01:03.889 --> 01:05.717
I mean, isn't that what people
call a car that sucks?

01:05.761 --> 01:07.067
Sounds like we're saying

01:07.110 --> 01:10.331
it's like a dull,
slow, bad tree-car.

01:10.374 --> 01:12.028
- Yeah, you know, I've gotta
say, I agree with you.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.073
You know,
I think the name's crap.

01:13.116 --> 01:14.509
- Do you?
- Yes, I do.

01:14.552 --> 01:15.988
I've always thought that.
- Have you?

01:16.032 --> 01:17.860
- Yes.
- To me, it sounds dirty.

01:17.903 --> 01:19.470
Like, pon sounds like poon,

01:19.514 --> 01:22.647
which means vagina,
and de rosa means "of pink."

01:22.691 --> 01:25.389
So I just picture a giant pink
vagina on wheels.

01:25.433 --> 01:27.217
- That's probably why
it tested so well.

01:27.261 --> 01:28.436
- The name isn't important.

01:28.479 --> 01:30.525
We've made advancements
in sensor fusion

01:30.568 --> 01:32.440
and scene recognition
that will revolutionize--

01:32.483 --> 01:35.138
- Wasn't there a car that meant
something bad in Spanish?

01:35.182 --> 01:36.705
- Yeah.
Quite a few of them actually.

01:36.748 --> 01:39.055
There's the Chevy Nova,
the Mazda Laputa,

01:39.099 --> 01:40.665
the Mitsubishi Pajero.

01:40.709 --> 01:42.232
- You'd think these companies
would hire at least one guy

01:42.276 --> 01:44.452
who spoke Spanish.

01:44.495 --> 01:47.150
- Does anyone here
speak Spanish?

01:49.283 --> 01:50.762
- Jesus, people.

01:53.678 --> 01:58.727

01:58.770 --> 02:02.034
- My great-grandfather would be
rolling over in his grave

02:02.078 --> 02:04.428
if he saw that woman running
the company that he founded.

02:04.472 --> 02:05.560
- Oh, because he hated women?

02:05.603 --> 02:06.865
- I thought he
hated communists.

02:06.909 --> 02:08.737
- No, I think it was Irishmen.
- No.

02:08.780 --> 02:10.608
It's because she knows nothing
about the auto industry.

02:10.652 --> 02:12.175
- She did pretty well
with that drug company.

02:12.219 --> 02:14.308
- Exactly.
She's literally a drug dealer.

02:14.351 --> 02:15.613
I wouldn't let my drug dealer

02:15.657 --> 02:17.485
run a billion-dollar
corporation.

02:17.528 --> 02:20.618
Actually, with him, I might.
He's like low-key genius.

02:20.662 --> 02:22.620
- I just never worked
for a woman before.

02:22.664 --> 02:24.187
You know, with a man,
if I make a mistake,

02:24.231 --> 02:25.449
I can flirt a little,

02:25.493 --> 02:27.625
but you cannot flirt
with a woman.

02:27.669 --> 02:29.758
Well, I guess you can,
technically.

02:29.801 --> 02:31.803
We're about 95% sure
about my cousin.

02:31.847 --> 02:34.284
- Hello.
- She just bought two ladders.

02:34.328 --> 02:35.807
- You'll be fine, all right?

02:35.851 --> 02:37.200
If anyone's gonna be fired,
it's probably gonna be me.

02:37.244 --> 02:38.375
- Or me.
- Yeah.

02:38.419 --> 02:39.507
Actually, I really hope
it is you.

02:39.550 --> 02:40.943
- I can totally see it
being you, dude.

02:40.986 --> 02:42.292
- Now that you said it
out loud, I was thinking it.

02:42.336 --> 02:43.989
- And another feature
of the Payne Ponderosa

02:44.033 --> 02:47.254
is it's--how do you say this?
Chassis, chass-ees?

02:47.297 --> 02:50.822
- Chass-y.
- Chass-y, oh, like gassy.

02:50.866 --> 02:53.216
I was feeling very gassy
when I got on my chassy.

02:53.260 --> 02:54.870
Chassy.
- Perfect.

02:54.913 --> 02:57.220
And then
before you introduce the car,

02:57.264 --> 02:58.656
I thought you might wanna
say a few words

02:58.700 --> 03:00.963
about what made you excited
to come to Payne?

03:01.006 --> 03:03.661
- Oh, I can do that
in two words, the money.

03:03.705 --> 03:05.881
I mean, obviously,
it wasn't just the money.

03:05.924 --> 03:07.578
There were stock options.

03:07.622 --> 03:09.319
- Right, well,
maybe just more what you love

03:09.363 --> 03:11.321
about cars then in general.

03:11.365 --> 03:13.671
- Honestly, I'm not
really that into cars.

03:13.715 --> 03:15.412
I mean, if anything,
I think is kind of weird

03:15.456 --> 03:17.762
how some people
fetishize transportation.

03:17.806 --> 03:19.286
- Right.

03:19.329 --> 03:21.026
Well, that could be a challenge
leading a car company.

03:21.070 --> 03:22.854
- I actually think it's better

03:22.898 --> 03:24.856
if you're not that
into what you're selling.

03:24.900 --> 03:27.511
It's, like, if you're really
into heroin, don't sell heroin.

03:27.555 --> 03:29.557
Go into a different field,
you know?

03:29.600 --> 03:31.776
Why, are you like some kind
of crazy car person?

03:31.820 --> 03:33.387
- Me?
Oh, no, not really.

03:33.430 --> 03:35.258
I mean, define car person,
right?

03:35.302 --> 03:37.521
Do I appreciate cars?
Sure.

03:37.565 --> 03:39.480
Do I love them?
I mean, define love.

03:39.523 --> 03:41.743
Define cars for that matter.

03:43.832 --> 03:47.183
Anyways, so the analysts,
they get here at 5:00.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.098
So if you want--
- Who's that guy?

03:49.141 --> 03:50.360
- I don't know.

03:50.404 --> 03:52.536
It's some worker.
He looks lost.

03:52.580 --> 03:53.450
- Seems like he needs
to talk to you.

03:53.494 --> 03:54.669
- Does he?
- Mm-hmm.

03:54.712 --> 03:58.847
- That's weird.
Okay, now I'll go--okay.

03:58.890 --> 04:00.501
Go see whoever
the heck that is.

04:00.544 --> 04:03.330
And we'll continue this
on the B side, Katherine.

04:03.373 --> 04:05.636
- Grassy Shirley Bassey
got on her chassy.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.377
- What are you doing here?

04:07.421 --> 04:08.726
- Oh, I just needed
to talk to you.

04:08.770 --> 04:10.162
Do you know I've never been up
to this level--

04:10.206 --> 04:11.381
- Just--haven't you--
- This place is really nice.

04:11.425 --> 04:13.253
- Yes, please get in.

04:14.471 --> 04:16.081
Look, I am sorry.

04:16.125 --> 04:18.301
Last week, that was fun,
but it was a mistake.

04:18.345 --> 04:20.912
- Oh, you told me.
- We have this new boss.

04:20.956 --> 04:22.740
And it would look really bad
for me

04:22.784 --> 04:24.220
to be involved
with a guy from the factory.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.656
Sorry, not the factory.
Just anyone who works here.

04:25.700 --> 04:27.049
- Are you trying
to have me transferred

04:27.092 --> 04:28.180
to the truck plant in Westland?

04:28.224 --> 04:29.617
- Hm?
- Yeah.

04:29.660 --> 04:31.096
I thought maybe you felt weird
about having me around

04:31.140 --> 04:33.751
after--well, you know,
and you want to get rid of me.

04:33.795 --> 04:37.842
- No, that was not me.
- Are you sure?

04:37.886 --> 04:40.410
Because my supervisor
said it was you.

04:40.454 --> 04:42.194
- Oh, Westland?
- Westland.

04:42.238 --> 04:43.587
- Westland?
- Westland.

04:43.631 --> 04:44.588
- Yes, no, what happened was

04:44.632 --> 04:46.329
that we got this call asking

04:46.373 --> 04:48.288
for a new day shift operator
in the Westland,

04:48.331 --> 04:49.332
and I heard you're the best.

04:49.376 --> 04:51.639
- Really?
Who do you hear that from?

04:51.682 --> 04:53.380
- Lots of people.
- Was one of them Shawn?

04:53.423 --> 04:55.425
- Yes, Shawn.
- Yes.

04:55.469 --> 04:57.079
- He loves you.
- Okay, which Shawn was it?

04:57.122 --> 04:59.211
- I do not know his last name--

04:59.255 --> 05:01.431
- 'Cause we don't have
a single Shawn that works here.

05:01.475 --> 05:03.564
- I find that hard to believe.

05:04.173 --> 05:06.741
- In a way, being the CEO would
have been the easy way out.

05:06.784 --> 05:09.091
I'm able to be more effective
as a consultant.

05:09.134 --> 05:10.397
- Mm-hmm.
- Dori.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.312
If anyone calls,
I'll be down at the test track.

05:12.355 --> 05:13.617
- Okay.

05:13.661 --> 05:14.966
- And can you handle
whatever A/V stuff we need

05:15.010 --> 05:16.316
for the presentation
this afternoon?

05:16.359 --> 05:17.534
- Me?

05:17.578 --> 05:18.796
The most technology I know

05:18.840 --> 05:21.364
how to use is my hair curler
and my vibrator.

05:21.408 --> 05:23.888
Right?

05:23.932 --> 05:27.849
Mm, but I will figure it out
because I'm a professional.

05:27.892 --> 05:31.026
- Great.
- Great.

05:31.069 --> 05:33.985
- Great?
Oh, my God.

05:34.029 --> 05:37.162
If I was CEO,
I would have said "Make it so."

05:37.206 --> 05:38.860
She's so generic.

Oh, baby, drive us
around the block.

05:53.178 --> 05:56.051

It's a car.

Everyone knows that.

algorithms to identify...

Ahh!

under your elbow.

07:17.915 --> 07:18.786
It helps with pain.
- I'm okay, I'm okay.

07:18.829 --> 07:20.048
They didn't hit me that hard.

07:20.091 --> 07:21.005
- We think we know
what caused the accident.

07:21.049 --> 07:22.616
- Alleged accident.
- Right.

07:22.659 --> 07:24.400
I may have coincidentally
fallen totally on my own.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.532
- Could be.
- Okay.

07:25.575 --> 07:27.098
Well, you know how I was saying

07:27.142 --> 07:29.492
that the car identifies objects
using machine learning?

07:29.536 --> 07:31.494
Well, the operative word is--

07:31.538 --> 07:33.191
- Machine.
- Learning.

07:33.235 --> 07:35.498
See, it still confuses
with dark tones with shadows.

07:35.542 --> 07:40.155
So occasionally, certain darker
optics come off as not there.

07:40.198 --> 07:42.200
- And by darker objects,
do you mean--

07:42.244 --> 07:43.985
- Like a black cat,

07:44.028 --> 07:48.685
or a dark blue car,
or darker brown skin.

07:51.688 --> 07:53.603
- So you've made a car
that hits Black people?

07:53.647 --> 07:57.085
- No, no, no.
Not intentionally.

07:57.128 --> 07:58.739
- Oh!
- Be your own people.

07:58.782 --> 08:00.218
- What would Ewell Payne
have said if he saw

08:00.262 --> 08:02.177
that we designed
the world's first racist car?

08:02.220 --> 08:05.093
- "Well done," probably.
- The car's not racist.

08:05.136 --> 08:07.661
Race is about a shared culture,
history, and traditions.

08:07.704 --> 08:09.445
This just doesn't
see darker skin.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.316
It hit Indian folk, too.

08:11.360 --> 08:12.622
- Oh, thank God.

08:12.666 --> 08:13.710
I thought for a moment
that we built a car

08:13.754 --> 08:15.190
that wouldn't
hit Indian people.

08:15.233 --> 08:16.844
- How are you just
figuring this out now?

08:16.887 --> 08:18.236
In the pharmaceutical industry,

08:18.280 --> 08:19.977
we would test a product
before we announced it.

08:20.021 --> 08:22.110
- Didn't stop all those babies
from being born without heads.

08:22.153 --> 08:23.328
- They had heads.

08:23.372 --> 08:24.765
They just weren't attached
to their bodies.

08:24.808 --> 08:26.027
- We tested it, but
the cardboard cutout thingies

08:26.070 --> 08:27.550
we tested it on were all white.

08:27.594 --> 08:29.160
- Well, why don't we get

08:29.204 --> 08:30.684
some black cardboard cutout
thingies, you know, inclusion?

08:30.727 --> 08:32.947
- Thank you for being an ally.
- His words.

08:32.990 --> 08:34.514
- Y'all know what this is,
right?

08:34.557 --> 08:36.428
This is white privilege.

08:36.472 --> 08:38.387
When you're white,
Band-Aids look good on you.

08:38.430 --> 08:41.085
Hell, even a cheap shampoo
at the hotel works for you.

08:41.129 --> 08:42.609
Do y'all know
the automatic soap dispensers

08:42.652 --> 08:44.132
in the restrooms
don't even work for me?

08:44.175 --> 08:46.830
- Those are push-button.
- Say what now?

08:46.874 --> 08:48.005
- They're push-button.

08:48.049 --> 08:49.137
- Just go like this--
- Yeah.

08:49.180 --> 08:50.268
- And they come--okay.
- Just press it.

08:50.312 --> 08:51.574
- Well, I've been
bringing my own soap,

08:51.618 --> 08:53.184
and I actually like it.

08:53.228 --> 08:54.490
- Okay, we need to figure out
how we're gonna handle this.

08:54.534 --> 08:55.491
This presentation
is in six hours,

08:55.535 --> 08:56.884
and we can't just cancel it.

08:56.927 --> 08:58.494
- Okay, what if we
painted the car black?

08:58.538 --> 08:59.887
Optics-wise, I think

08:59.930 --> 09:02.063
a white car that hits
Black people looks worse

09:02.106 --> 09:03.717
than a black car
that hits Black people.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.240
- I think any car
that targets people

09:05.283 --> 09:07.634
based on their race
would look pretty not great.

09:07.677 --> 09:08.765
- Especially since
Black Lives Matter.

09:08.809 --> 09:10.332
- To be fair,

09:10.375 --> 09:12.073
it would have been bad
before Black Lives Matter, too.

09:12.116 --> 09:13.770
- Right, but like,
now we understand that also.

09:13.814 --> 09:15.598
- Okay, the analysts don't know

09:15.642 --> 09:16.599
that the car
is self-driving, right?

09:16.643 --> 09:18.166
That's the big reveal?

09:18.209 --> 09:19.428
Okay, so maybe we just think
of some other features.

09:19.471 --> 09:20.908
- In six hours?

09:20.951 --> 09:22.431
- I'm sure nothing will be
as innovative and exciting

09:22.474 --> 09:23.998
as your Klanmobile over there,

09:24.041 --> 09:26.478
but let's not let the perfect
be the enemy of the good.

09:26.522 --> 09:28.350
You should come.
- Me?

09:28.393 --> 09:29.743
- Him, why?
Why him?

09:29.786 --> 09:31.396
- Well, because I would
like his perspective.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.790
Plus, we just hit him
with a car in a way

09:33.834 --> 09:36.010
that might be perceived
as a hate crime.

09:36.053 --> 09:38.360
And so you're part of this now.

09:38.403 --> 09:40.667
- Good, now tell me this,
would the car also

09:40.710 --> 09:43.670
hit a white person
if they was in blackface?

09:43.713 --> 09:45.628
- Yeah, probably.
- Right on!

09:45.672 --> 09:46.934
- Lead with that, say that.

09:46.977 --> 09:48.762
- So it's not all bad.
- Silver lining.

[upbeat music]

09:51.765 --> 09:54.724
- How is this my fault?
I licensed the AI.

09:54.768 --> 09:56.508
I didn't program it
from scratch.

09:56.552 --> 09:57.988
- No one's saying
it's your fault.

09:58.032 --> 09:59.642
- But sure, blame the Black guy
for systemic racism,

09:59.686 --> 10:02.123
and then ask the Black guy
to fix the systemic racism.

10:02.166 --> 10:03.646
Do you know how much
pressure that puts on me?

10:03.690 --> 10:04.691
- Is it a lot?

10:04.734 --> 10:06.257
- It is a lot.
- Yeah.

10:06.301 --> 10:09.347
- And FYI, I didn't test it
on non-white cutouts

10:09.391 --> 10:10.740
'cause we don't have
non-white cutouts.

10:10.784 --> 10:12.133
You know why?

10:12.176 --> 10:14.222
- Why?
- Because of systemic racism.

10:14.265 --> 10:15.876
- Yeah.

10:15.919 --> 10:17.660
Well, at least you're not being
forced to work on a project

10:17.704 --> 10:19.401
with a new boss
you're trying to impress

10:19.444 --> 10:22.012
and a subordinate
you just had sex with.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.841
- Hot assembly line-guy?
- Yeah.

10:24.885 --> 10:27.757
- Shut up, when?
- Greg's retirement party.

10:27.801 --> 10:30.281
I'd had a few drinks,
and he's very attractive.

10:30.325 --> 10:32.675
Katherine already thinks
I'm some car-obsessed fangirl.

10:32.719 --> 10:35.025
Now she's also gonna think I
can't keep my pants on at work.

10:35.069 --> 10:37.288
- Look, there's like 15,000
people who work here.

10:37.332 --> 10:39.377
After today,
he'll go back to the line.

10:39.421 --> 10:40.770
She's never gonna find out.

10:40.814 --> 10:42.467
- I never even flirt
with coworkers.

10:42.511 --> 10:44.165
The one time I make a mistake,

10:44.208 --> 10:45.949
and I'm stuck with it
forever like herpes.

10:45.993 --> 10:47.603
- A lot of people have herpes.

10:47.647 --> 10:48.822
It's not that big
a deal anymore.

10:48.865 --> 10:50.084

He didn't give me herpes.

10:50.127 --> 10:51.433
- Who'd you get it from then?

10:51.476 --> 10:53.087
- Okay, so what about
if we had a second horn

10:53.130 --> 10:54.305
that's like a polite horn.

10:54.349 --> 10:56.873
So the first horn is like,
"Rrrrh!"

10:56.917 --> 10:58.396
Like, "I hate you."

10:58.440 --> 11:01.443
But then the second horn is,
like, "eeh."

the light is green."

11:03.837 --> 11:05.055
Right?

11:05.099 --> 11:06.840

polite horn counts

11:06.883 --> 11:08.145
as the car of the future.

11:08.189 --> 11:09.538
- Okay, well, maybe we should

11:09.581 --> 11:10.844
still write it down
so we don't forget it.

11:10.887 --> 11:12.149
- What about some sort
of safety feature?

The all-new Payne
featuring a safety feature.

11:16.371 --> 11:18.634
- All right, guys,
I think we need to step back

11:18.678 --> 11:21.942
and ask ourself
what do people like about cars?

11:21.985 --> 11:23.987
- You don't like cars?
- I mean, they're fine.

11:24.031 --> 11:25.772
Sometimes I'm in a place,
and I need to go

11:25.815 --> 11:27.512
to another place,
and cars help me do that.

11:27.556 --> 11:28.818
- What?

11:28.862 --> 11:31.038
- Cars are where form
meets function.

11:31.081 --> 11:33.214
Name one other thing
that's utilitarian

11:33.257 --> 11:35.607

11:39.394 --> 11:40.874
- Uh-huh.
That would be another one.

11:40.917 --> 11:43.398

a car is about freedom.

11:51.101 --> 11:52.320
- Okay,
when people are buying cars,

11:52.363 --> 11:53.582
they look at a bunch
of different factors.

11:53.625 --> 11:55.976
There's fuel economy,
safety, price, comfort--

11:56.019 --> 11:58.326

to business school

12:00.371 --> 12:02.722
or anything like that, I like
cars 'cause they're cool.

12:02.765 --> 12:04.419
That is it.
They look cool.

12:04.462 --> 12:06.116
They sound cool.
They are fun to drive.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.901
That's why
I don't get why anybody ever

12:07.944 --> 12:10.599
in their right mind would
want a self-driving car.

12:10.642 --> 12:12.514
Driving is just fun.

12:14.037 --> 12:15.909

for car-nuts.

12:15.952 --> 12:17.954
- You like cars
as much as I do.

12:17.998 --> 12:19.390
- Not really, I don't know
why you'd say that.

12:19.434 --> 12:21.044
- Well, because you got
Ferrari bedsheets

12:21.088 --> 12:22.524

like a fuel nozzle.

- Hey, hey.

12:31.663 --> 12:33.274
So should we get back
to the car we're supposed

12:33.317 --> 12:35.276

Okay, new approach.

In pharma,
let's say that the patent

12:41.108 --> 12:42.892

12:42.936 --> 12:44.807
Well, constipated
people get pain, too.

12:44.851 --> 12:47.114
So you mix a little poop meds
in with your pain pill,

12:47.157 --> 12:48.463
and next thing you know,

12:48.506 --> 12:50.987
Rasputinol is making
$1.6 billion.

12:51.031 --> 12:52.684
- I used to snort Rasputinol.
- Everyone did.

12:52.728 --> 12:54.077
That's why it grossed 1.6.

12:54.121 --> 12:57.689
- So you just wanna combine
like a bunch of cars?

12:57.733 --> 12:58.995
- Well, no.

just the best parts.

how many metaphors

that we need to say
to explain this.

13:05.436 --> 13:06.437

13:07.787 --> 13:09.266
these random car parts
supposed to come from?

13:11.268 --> 13:13.140

the employees' cars.

onto company property.
