00:21.187 --> 00:24.607
LATE 2013

00:40.123 --> 00:42.542
You have to wait for it
to be absorbed completely.

00:46.755 --> 00:48.673
In 15 days you'll see the final result.

00:51.050 --> 00:52.218
When does it wear off?

00:53.511 --> 00:54.554
Nine months to a year.

00:55.388 --> 00:56.347
It depends on the skin.

00:58.058 --> 00:58.975
Over here, please.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.901
You said it was Damaso's wife
who recommended me?

01:09.444 --> 01:10.695
Yes. Nancy.

01:10.779 --> 01:12.155
She convinced me to do it.

01:13.156 --> 01:14.783
I hope you're satisfied with the result.

01:15.742 --> 01:16.993
I want to have other enhancements done.

01:17.368 --> 01:18.244
I'll let you know.

01:19.412 --> 01:20.705
This is my direct number.

01:21.539 --> 01:22.916
Did you leave your information
with my assistant?

01:23.416 --> 01:24.250
No.

01:24.626 --> 01:27.170
I'd prefer the communication
be directly with you.

01:28.046 --> 01:29.047
Of course.

01:30.799 --> 01:31.966
Let me have your number.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.010
Six, six, seven...

01:36.638 --> 01:37.764
Thank you for coming.

01:38.139 --> 01:40.099
-I'm at your service.
-Thank you.

01:44.687 --> 01:46.523
Miss Carla, come in, please.

02:14.926 --> 02:16.427
We have to be more discrete, Carla.

02:17.345 --> 02:18.513
If your husband finds out...

02:20.181 --> 02:21.224
he'll kill me.

02:32.360 --> 02:36.239
I feel the warmth
From my boiling blood

02:36.781 --> 02:40.702
I feel the fear, sweat dripping away

02:41.119 --> 02:45.081
There's a stillness
That nothing transmits

02:45.665 --> 02:50.670
I'm a breeze that grows stronger

02:52.088 --> 02:55.383
Even when the clouds drift away

02:56.509 --> 02:59.721
Even when my skin dries away

03:00.555 --> 03:04.225
I'll be back someday

03:05.184 --> 03:08.813
To unleash my return

03:13.860 --> 03:17.739
I have the dust that protects the road

03:18.239 --> 03:21.993
I have the branches of a leafless tree

03:22.660 --> 03:26.581
I'm the guardian of the tired night

03:27.040 --> 03:32.170
There are silhouettes that
Come to meet me

03:33.546 --> 03:37.008
Even when the clouds drift away

03:37.926 --> 03:41.387
Even when my skin dries away

03:42.013 --> 03:45.600
I'll be back someday

03:46.726 --> 03:50.521
To unleash my return

04:01.950 --> 04:03.868
JORGE DEL TORO'S RANCH
QUILÁ, SINALOA

04:03.952 --> 04:05.745
I want to propose the next step.

04:07.038 --> 04:07.956
There's still more?

04:08.665 --> 04:10.500
Your organization is all over the world.

04:10.875 --> 04:13.127
I'm talking about the next step here,
in our house.

04:14.170 --> 04:16.422
We run all the institutions in Sinaloa.

04:17.298 --> 04:18.383
Everyone knows that.

04:19.968 --> 04:22.136
But our deals have always
been under the table.

04:23.721 --> 04:25.223
I don't want us to hide any longer.

04:26.349 --> 04:29.143
I want the organization to be
on top of the institutions.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.354
Cool.

04:31.854 --> 04:33.606
To run the state freely.

04:33.815 --> 04:35.566
Are we ready for that?

04:36.651 --> 04:37.819
What do you say, Jorge?

04:40.613 --> 04:42.865
You play the music, and I'll dance.

04:44.075 --> 04:45.285
Where should we start?

04:45.576 --> 04:48.413
Getting rid of the few
municipal leaders that are not with us.

04:51.082 --> 04:52.125
You got it.

04:52.625 --> 04:53.584
Cheers.

04:59.465 --> 05:02.051
MEXICO CITY

05:04.262 --> 05:05.805
"Saving Mexico."

05:07.724 --> 05:08.808
We're doing good.

05:09.475 --> 05:10.810
We're doing very good.

05:11.769 --> 05:14.856
He's been elected,
you as Secretary of State,

05:14.939 --> 05:16.107
and I as a senator.

05:16.190 --> 05:17.692
We can't complain.

05:19.110 --> 05:20.361
I'm just leaving for the NGO.

05:20.945 --> 05:22.405
The director will greet you.

05:22.488 --> 05:24.240
His name is Raul Escalante.

05:24.324 --> 05:27.994
It's a NGO against drugs,
present in all states.

05:28.619 --> 05:30.538
It will be a great story for the media.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.874
Welcome, Mr. Secretary.

05:33.207 --> 05:34.667
Thank you for setting time aside to come.

05:34.959 --> 05:37.336
I have to thank you, Mr. Escalante

05:37.712 --> 05:40.214
and all your collaborators
for their hard work.

05:40.631 --> 05:42.925
We have to fight drugs from all sides.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.720
-Over here, please.
-Thank you.

05:51.934 --> 05:55.354
Tell me, how many patients do you
treat annually on a national level?

05:56.064 --> 05:58.941
We treat 52,500 people and their families.

06:00.234 --> 06:03.446
This is a process in which
the patient's family is fundamental.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.742
These are some of our counselors.

06:08.117 --> 06:09.494
-Nice to meet you.
-Thank you.

06:09.619 --> 06:10.703
Thank you for everything.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.538
Sir, good day. I wish you the best.

06:12.747 --> 06:13.706
Thank you. Likewise.

06:13.831 --> 06:15.500
The counselors play a very important role.

06:16.417 --> 06:19.337
They're people that have been through it,
and are now completely rehabilitated.

06:19.670 --> 06:22.006
They're an example
for those trying to do the same.

06:23.925 --> 06:25.676
...get to what
we are looking for...

06:25.802 --> 06:27.678
in the end, is support and...

06:27.804 --> 06:28.679
Sebastian.

06:28.930 --> 06:29.972
Just a minute...

06:33.684 --> 06:35.978
Sebastian is one of our best counselors.

06:36.270 --> 06:37.605
Nice to meet you, Mr. Secretary.

06:41.150 --> 06:42.110
It's a pleasure.

06:43.361 --> 06:44.529
This way, please.

06:48.616 --> 06:51.077
We use this space to work
with the families.

06:51.619 --> 06:52.620
As I was mentioning,

06:53.037 --> 06:54.914
the support of at least one family member

06:55.289 --> 06:57.500
is vital for the patient's recovery.

07:09.720 --> 07:10.847
Good afternoon.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.641
We're Isidoro's guys, buddy.

07:13.766 --> 07:14.725
You can't be here.

07:15.810 --> 07:16.727
Why not?

07:17.603 --> 07:19.105
It's been arranged.

07:19.188 --> 07:21.649
Not anymore. Give your boss the message.

07:24.694 --> 07:27.655
I pay you to let me work,
not to fuck with me!

07:37.498 --> 07:38.583
El Chapo again?

07:38.708 --> 07:39.625
Yes.

07:39.709 --> 07:42.628
Since he's been working with
the government again, he keeps striking.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.922
Now he's turned the
municipal police against us.

07:50.970 --> 07:52.555
It'll be hard to get to him, boss.

07:53.556 --> 07:54.724
He's very well protected.

07:55.641 --> 07:58.811
Besides his people, he's being protected
by the governor's people.

08:04.525 --> 08:06.194
If we can't hit him directly,

08:07.278 --> 08:08.863
we'll have to do it from the side, right?

08:12.950 --> 08:15.536
SINALOA DEPOSIT
NOGALES, MEXICO

08:33.095 --> 08:35.306
Tell Chapo that Isidoro sends his regards.

08:36.682 --> 08:37.517
Take him!

08:49.362 --> 08:51.239
Take everything. Let's go!

08:55.117 --> 08:56.577
The girls are beautiful.

08:57.453 --> 08:58.371
Like their mom.

09:00.456 --> 09:02.250
Can we go to the beach so they can
see the sea for the fist time?

09:02.750 --> 09:03.584
Done.

09:04.460 --> 09:05.545
Excuse me, sir.

09:08.422 --> 09:09.840
We can go to Mazatlán, darling.

09:13.678 --> 09:14.720
What's up?

09:16.347 --> 09:18.558
Isidoro stole the gun shipment
from Nogales.

09:20.142 --> 09:21.018
How much?

09:21.310 --> 09:23.396
A hundred and fifty AK-47's
and a thousand rounds of ammo.

09:24.772 --> 09:26.399
We've been too forgiving
with that bastard.

09:27.066 --> 09:27.984
Set everything up.

09:28.651 --> 09:29.944
We're going to Guasave.

09:36.993 --> 09:39.495
Here are the names and contact information
of the employees

09:39.579 --> 09:41.038
and collaborators, Mr. Secretary.

09:41.122 --> 09:42.623
I also included their pictures.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.001
Thank you.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.460
At your service. Excuse me.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.829
REHABILITATED COUNSELOR

10:40.556 --> 10:41.390
Yes, hello?

10:42.767 --> 10:43.601
Hello?

10:51.317 --> 10:52.193
Conrado?

11:19.053 --> 11:21.472
INCOMING CALL

11:56.465 --> 11:57.425
That's it.

11:58.634 --> 12:00.177
ISIDORO'S LABORATORY HOUSE
GUASAVE SINALOA

12:00.261 --> 12:01.470
Wait for my signal.

12:36.338 --> 12:37.840
Get the meth, come on!

13:19.840 --> 13:21.800
And with this agreement signed...

13:21.884 --> 13:22.885
SINALOA GOVERNMENT PALACE
CULIACAN, MEXICO

13:22.968 --> 13:28.516
...we'll bring modernization and
automation of the agri-food sector

13:28.766 --> 13:30.559
to the state of Sinaloa.

13:37.691 --> 13:41.487
You'll have it rough tonight,
the boss went out dancing.

13:41.737 --> 13:43.656
Come early tomorrow,
I want to sleep.

13:44.198 --> 13:45.449
-I'll see you.
-All right.

13:50.704 --> 13:51.830
Hi, baby.

13:52.206 --> 13:53.541
I'll be home for dinner tonight.

13:54.750 --> 13:55.709
Of course.

13:55.960 --> 13:59.046
You know that when one's hungry,
all you can think of is food.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.116
Bastard finally has a day off.

14:39.128 --> 14:40.045
Come on!

15:18.208 --> 15:20.419
Your family's safety
depends on you.

15:23.422 --> 15:25.299
Tell me about the relationship
that your boss,

15:25.424 --> 15:27.885
the governor Jorge del Toro,
has with Chapo Guzman.

15:29.678 --> 15:32.139
What kind of protection
do they give him in Sinaloa?

15:38.812 --> 15:40.898
Speak or your family
will tell no tales.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.542
I was in a meeting at Quilá.

16:01.585 --> 16:03.629
The meeting was at my boss's house,

16:03.963 --> 16:05.381
Governor Jorge del Toro.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.633
The main guys were there.

16:08.092 --> 16:10.260
Chapo, but also Ismael Zambrano.

16:16.225 --> 16:18.894
In that meeting, they talked about
the possibility of creating a group

16:18.978 --> 16:20.854
to protect all organized crime.

16:21.313 --> 16:22.648
I don't want us to hide.

16:23.440 --> 16:26.193
I want the organization to be
on top of the institutions.

16:26.694 --> 16:27.736
They also talked

16:27.945 --> 16:30.447
about the possibility
for all the drug lords

16:31.198 --> 16:32.992
having absolute control over the state.

16:37.454 --> 16:38.789
They also talked about

16:40.040 --> 16:42.876
cleaning all the municipalities
that weren't under

16:42.960 --> 16:44.003
the Sinaloa cartel.

16:49.008 --> 16:52.428
A few days after his kidnapping
by an armed group,

16:52.594 --> 16:56.557
Jorge del Toro's bodyguard was found dead.

16:56.890 --> 16:59.852
But he also made
an appearance through social media

16:59.935 --> 17:02.688
in a video where
serious accusations are made

17:02.855 --> 17:06.650
linking Governor Jorge del Toro
with the Sinaloa cartel.

17:06.734 --> 17:08.652
The meeting was at my boss's house.

17:10.779 --> 17:14.283
The main guys were there.
Chapo, but also Ismael Zambrano.

17:15.075 --> 17:17.202
They also talked about cleaning all
the municipalities

17:17.286 --> 17:19.538
that weren't under
the Sinaloa cartel's command.

17:21.248 --> 17:23.042
Put a hold on that job in Juarez.

17:24.043 --> 17:26.253
The gringos are gonna go crazy
with this mess.

17:28.047 --> 17:31.759
Chapo Guzman was there
and my boss, Governor Jorge del Toro.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.303
In that meeting, they talked about
the possibility of creating a group

17:34.386 --> 17:36.972
to protect all organized crime.

17:37.222 --> 17:40.517
They also talked about the possibility
for all drug lords

17:40.642 --> 17:42.436
to have absolute control over the state.

17:48.442 --> 17:51.945
You have several public appearances
with Jorge del Toro.

17:53.655 --> 17:54.948
This will stain you.

17:59.161 --> 18:00.037
Yes?

18:00.120 --> 18:01.747
Sir, Richard Smith from the DEA

18:01.830 --> 18:03.791
is asking for a meeting
as soon as possible.

18:07.669 --> 18:10.297
We have to give something to Conrado
so he can take the pressure,

18:11.298 --> 18:13.133
or else, I'll have the Navy
after me again.

18:15.552 --> 18:16.970
That's why I want to give him
the Juarez thing.

18:19.056 --> 18:21.225
That job was about 10 million dollars.

18:23.185 --> 18:25.729
That bust should be enough
to calm the gringos down.

18:26.230 --> 18:27.147
And Jorge?

18:27.981 --> 18:28.982
The usual.

18:29.858 --> 18:30.901
He'll say there's no proof.

18:30.984 --> 18:33.695
That his bodyguard said that
because Isidoro's men made him.

18:34.905 --> 18:37.116
They will ask us not to make a big mess.

18:38.575 --> 18:40.119
We'll take care of Isidoro later.

18:40.911 --> 18:43.872
Calm things down with Jorge,
and I'll take care of Conrado.

18:46.500 --> 18:47.918
Juarez is not good enough.

18:48.919 --> 18:50.671
I've never given you
something so big.

18:51.797 --> 18:55.843
I need something to keep the DEA relaxed.
Something that convinces them.

18:56.677 --> 18:57.594
What do you want?

18:59.138 --> 19:00.681
We're going for your lab in Tamazula.

19:01.265 --> 19:02.808
No, not that.

19:03.016 --> 19:04.768
The decision has been made, Joaquin.

19:05.561 --> 19:07.354
Get your people out
if you don't want them arrested.

19:08.313 --> 19:10.065
But we are dismantling that lab.

19:20.075 --> 19:22.327
Come on! Get out, you have to go!

19:22.578 --> 19:25.706
Don't take anything, get out if you
don't want the army to take you!

19:26.206 --> 19:27.833
Get in the trucks!

19:28.458 --> 19:31.253
Leave whatever you're doing
and get in the trucks!

19:34.506 --> 19:36.008
Get in the trucks!

19:51.273 --> 19:53.525
We are inside of one of the six buildings

19:53.609 --> 19:55.569
that were found here,
in Durango's mountain range,

19:55.944 --> 19:58.989
which were part of a mega-lab.

19:59.114 --> 20:02.492
These are the flasks where the drug

20:02.576 --> 20:04.203
known as crystal was prepared,

20:04.369 --> 20:07.581
this was the final process to get to this,

20:07.664 --> 20:10.709
that is the "ice" or crystal,
how it's commonly known.

20:10.792 --> 20:14.671
And these buildings
had the capacity to process

20:14.838 --> 20:18.634
about 220 pounds a day
of this forbidden matter.

20:19.051 --> 20:22.054
The place is in the zone where
the Sinaloa cartel operates,

20:22.304 --> 20:26.183
that is Durango, Sinaloa and Chihuahua,
known as the Golden Triangle.

20:26.600 --> 20:30.437
The ownership of this narco-lab
is attributed to El Chapo Guzman.

20:58.173 --> 21:00.759
I always considered Jorge
to be a responsible politician.

21:03.011 --> 21:05.639
I'm not aware whether his bodyguard's
testimony is true or not.

21:08.308 --> 21:10.018
You have any proof that it is?

21:10.352 --> 21:11.311
No.

21:27.995 --> 21:29.538
I hope that with these pictures

21:29.621 --> 21:31.832
you're not suggesting anything
that dishonors my government.

21:44.428 --> 21:47.639
The Secretary of State
should share our same frustration.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.767
He's been participating
in the search for a long time.

21:51.351 --> 21:52.436
Of course.

22:16.710 --> 22:20.505
Fucking gringos, they have us
by the balls with Plan Merida.

22:22.215 --> 22:24.384
It's not convenient they cut off
cooperation.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.265
El Chapo's time is up.

22:33.101 --> 22:34.186
Do you know where he's hiding?

22:35.645 --> 22:36.938
I only know he's in Culiacan.

22:46.406 --> 22:47.532
I'll handle him.

22:51.453 --> 22:52.871
But, when we capture him,

22:53.497 --> 22:54.915
he can't be extradited.

22:56.666 --> 22:58.168
Chapo has too much information.

23:01.046 --> 23:04.299
MEXICO CITY

23:15.477 --> 23:16.686
I want you to trace a number.

23:17.979 --> 23:19.231
How much time do you need?

23:23.026 --> 23:25.153
First Mayel and now the lab.

23:26.655 --> 23:28.073
The gringos don't forgive.

23:32.869 --> 23:34.454
With this, they should cool down.

23:34.955 --> 23:37.207
That lab thing will make us
close some routes.

23:37.666 --> 23:39.376
But that's better than having
the navy all over you.

23:40.168 --> 23:42.879
We have to keep Conrado happy,
so he can keep our agreements

23:42.963 --> 23:44.131
and protect me from the gringos.

23:45.507 --> 23:47.008
What they want is to get to me,

23:48.301 --> 23:49.928
but that won't happen, son.

23:54.558 --> 23:56.768
I'm sorry, sir,
the number can't be traced.

23:56.852 --> 23:57.727
Why not?

23:58.395 --> 24:00.313
It's a number I usually communicate to.

24:00.397 --> 24:02.107
There's no signal when I trace it.

24:02.399 --> 24:04.317
Most likely, after the calls,

24:04.442 --> 24:05.902
the cell phone's chip is destroyed.

24:06.027 --> 24:08.363
That explains why you can communicate
to the same number

24:08.446 --> 24:11.575
but it's not related
to any localization signal.

24:16.746 --> 24:17.581
Thank you.

24:17.873 --> 24:20.000
-I'll call you if I need anything.
-Good night.

24:31.970 --> 24:34.472
We have to reallocate our people
while we build the next one.

24:35.473 --> 24:38.185
We're sending them to Nogales,
Hermosillo and Mexicali.

24:38.810 --> 24:39.853
To the smaller labs.

24:40.645 --> 24:42.480
Quino, look for an area
where we can build.

24:42.772 --> 24:46.526
The same: big property, the harder
to get there the better.

24:48.737 --> 24:50.363
Look for something by Compostela.

24:52.157 --> 24:54.034
Take the blueprint
so it can be the same as this one.

24:54.451 --> 24:55.410
Not the same, but better.

24:56.119 --> 24:57.537
In the other one we needed
more storage space.

24:58.205 --> 24:59.372
Great, take care of it.

25:04.252 --> 25:05.587
-Look.
-Hello?

25:06.588 --> 25:08.215
The lab should be enough.

25:09.216 --> 25:10.508
Sadly, no, Joaquin.

25:11.509 --> 25:12.928
The gringos have it out for you.

25:13.678 --> 25:15.180
They're pressuring the President.

25:15.263 --> 25:16.973
I need you to help me so I can help you.

25:17.807 --> 25:19.100
I can give you another shipment.

25:19.643 --> 25:20.560
No.

25:21.728 --> 25:23.396
I need to arrest people this time.

25:24.940 --> 25:26.858
No gunmen or hitmen.

25:27.734 --> 25:29.277
I want new faces, at least three.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.405
Something that will get me a headline.

25:33.949 --> 25:35.200
You're asking for too much, Conrado.

25:35.992 --> 25:37.869
The Jorge del Toro thing
reactivated the DEA.

25:38.203 --> 25:40.622
It's the minimum I'm asking for
to get them off your back.

25:47.754 --> 25:49.256
They're gonna call you
to give you the names.

25:58.682 --> 25:59.557
Did he accept?

26:01.559 --> 26:02.519
Do you think it will work?

26:09.859 --> 26:12.821
"THE BANKER"
CHAPO'S FINANCIAL TRADER

26:17.450 --> 26:18.535
-Stop!
-Freeze!

26:29.838 --> 26:32.966
"LIEUTENANT"
CHAPO'S DISTRIBUTION BOSS

26:36.219 --> 26:37.095
Freeze, assholes!

26:37.595 --> 26:39.472
Get down, now! Get down, everybody!

26:39.806 --> 26:42.475
Quickly, to the floor!
Under the truck, quickly!

26:49.357 --> 26:51.359
"COMMANDER"
CHAPO'S SECURITY

27:05.915 --> 27:07.542
I'm the Secretary of State.

27:08.376 --> 27:09.836
I think you know me.

27:10.920 --> 27:12.714
You're here because you're
money laundering for El Chapo.

27:13.798 --> 27:15.175
He gave us your name.

27:16.051 --> 27:18.553
Your weekends at the clubs
in San Diego are over.

27:19.054 --> 27:22.223
You'll be locked up for a long time
for transporting drugs to El Chapo.

27:23.350 --> 27:25.101
There's only one way
to avoid being locked up

27:25.185 --> 27:26.853
in the toughest prison in the country.

27:30.231 --> 27:31.566
I need information.

27:33.485 --> 27:36.571
I need to know the location
of the safe houses

27:36.863 --> 27:38.365
of the man who betrayed you.

27:40.533 --> 27:42.535
If you help me find Joaquin Guzman,

27:43.870 --> 27:46.331
I'll make your stay
in the prison very short.

27:49.334 --> 27:51.002
Nobody will know it was you.

28:03.098 --> 28:04.391
Wait for me in the car,
I'll be right there.

28:10.897 --> 28:13.733
Take care of them,
don't keep them in the sun for too long.

28:13.817 --> 28:14.734
When are you going?

28:15.151 --> 28:16.528
As soon as I can, darling.

28:16.778 --> 28:18.947
I'll just close a deal
and I'll go to Mazatlán.

28:25.537 --> 28:26.454
Don't take long.

28:27.122 --> 28:27.997
Take care.

28:59.821 --> 29:01.865
Put 20 more grams per cucumber.

29:05.994 --> 29:07.412
We have to take full advantage
of this job.

29:08.538 --> 29:09.914
We've lost a lot of cash.

29:19.132 --> 29:22.177
Bravo, stay alert, we have
movement in the safe houses.

29:22.510 --> 29:23.511
Let me talk to him!

29:25.263 --> 29:26.723
Lopez? Is it the navy?

29:27.015 --> 29:28.975
The navy, the army and the feds, sir.

29:29.392 --> 29:30.977
They're hitting several houses
at the same time.

29:31.644 --> 29:32.812
Sir, we have to evacuate.

29:34.522 --> 29:35.732
Go to the usual spot.

29:35.899 --> 29:36.983
Copy that, sir.

29:39.360 --> 29:40.361
Stay alert! Operative!

29:41.488 --> 29:43.156
The security door
will give us an advantage.

29:43.323 --> 29:44.449
Let's go, let's go!

29:44.574 --> 29:45.533
Come on!

31:11.369 --> 31:12.287
I understand.

31:13.037 --> 31:13.997
Thank you.

31:19.752 --> 31:20.628
Did he get away?

31:21.713 --> 31:22.839
Through a fucking tunnel!

31:25.091 --> 31:27.093
This was the perfect opportunity
to catch him!

31:32.390 --> 31:33.850
Now he knows we're after him.

31:34.517 --> 31:36.895
That will make it harder,
but not impossible.

31:38.813 --> 31:40.356
You won't gain anything by worrying.

31:42.525 --> 31:45.111
You need to clear your head
and think on the next step.

31:48.239 --> 31:49.407
Why don't you go see Lalo?

31:50.700 --> 31:52.285
Sex helps me clear my head.

31:55.038 --> 31:55.997
You're right.

32:01.836 --> 32:03.338
I need to stop thinking.

32:18.186 --> 32:19.270
I'll be a while.

32:22.398 --> 32:23.524
Run your errands and I'll call you back.

34:46.167 --> 34:47.085
Who is it?

34:48.628 --> 34:50.088
Sebastian, it's me.

36:15.756 --> 36:16.674
Hi.

36:20.636 --> 36:22.138
I told you to wait at the hostel.

36:24.682 --> 36:26.475
You take too long and I get bored.

36:38.446 --> 36:39.363
What was that?

37:09.894 --> 37:12.980
THAT'S NOT YOUR WOMAN
SHE BELONGS TO THE BOSS

37:15.233 --> 37:16.359
What are we gonna do?

37:36.587 --> 37:38.172
We've been at it
all night with this, Joaquin.

37:39.715 --> 37:41.175
Going to Mazatlán is way too risky.

37:42.468 --> 37:43.552
Sol betrayed me.

37:44.845 --> 37:46.514
I have to disappear for a while.

37:50.351 --> 37:52.687
But I'm not leaving
without seeing Elba and the girls.

37:53.104 --> 37:54.146
I understand.

37:54.981 --> 37:56.649
But going from here to Los Cabos is safer.

37:57.817 --> 37:59.485
The faster you get to that turf,
the better.

38:00.820 --> 38:02.613
It's out of the government's radar,
you said so.

38:02.822 --> 38:03.864
Bravo.

38:06.659 --> 38:08.577
-Yes, sir.
-Coordinate your people in Mazatlán.

38:09.078 --> 38:10.288
Double our security.

38:12.373 --> 38:13.582
We're going to see my kids.

38:45.197 --> 38:46.532
You're very stubborn, Joaquin.

38:47.450 --> 38:48.743
You shouldn't go there.

38:49.702 --> 38:51.662
You once helped me get out of jail.

38:52.705 --> 38:54.915
Now you're gonna help me
not to get in again.

38:55.833 --> 38:56.792
Wait for me in Los Cabos.

38:58.836 --> 39:00.254
I'm going to Mazatlán for a few hours

39:00.755 --> 39:01.881
and we'll meet there.

39:03.966 --> 39:05.885
Say hi to Elba and the kids.

39:09.096 --> 39:10.222
To the trucks!

39:11.307 --> 39:13.476
Her husband is a lieutenant
in the Sinaloa cartel.

39:15.227 --> 39:16.228
If you don't help us,

39:17.229 --> 39:18.105
we'll be killed.

39:18.731 --> 39:20.149
What's his position in the cartel?

39:23.778 --> 39:24.987
Is he related to the bosses?

39:46.008 --> 39:47.385
I treat the wives.

39:48.302 --> 39:49.804
The drug lords' wives?

39:53.265 --> 39:55.101
I treated Chapo Guzman's wife recently.

39:58.437 --> 39:59.772
Her personal number is in my contacts.

40:10.783 --> 40:12.201
She's under the name...

40:13.202 --> 40:14.578
EC.

40:17.957 --> 40:18.833
EC?

40:20.418 --> 40:21.502
Elba Coronado.
