The man is
a sick bastard.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.310
He's not that bad.

01:13.674 --> 01:15.950
It was on
his business card.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.159
It was a joke.

01:22.616 --> 01:25.324
You're better off
without him. Okay?

01:26.753 --> 01:28.596
Now can we change
the subject?

01:28.689 --> 01:31.966
We've been talking about your
ex since we left Pristina.

Hang tight.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.850
Not seeing
anything you like?

02:58.945 --> 03:00.856
Our orders
are very specific.

03:00.947 --> 03:02.688
We're looking for something
a little more high-grade.

03:02.849 --> 03:04.988
I got two smoke
shows coming up.

03:05.052 --> 03:07.896
Brand-new, fresh
fucking racehorses.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.592
Sit down, give me
two minutes.

03:10.824 --> 03:14.328
You need some positive male
attention for a change.

03:28.141 --> 03:29.085
<i>All right, all right.</i>

03:29.176 --> 03:32.157
<i>Gentlemen, give it up
for our next act.</i>

03:32.212 --> 03:35.887
<i>We got some European
beauties for you.</i>

04:39.880 --> 04:41.917
High-grade enough

04:42.215 --> 04:44.217
Yeah,

04:48.288 --> 04:49.824

06:10.203 --> 06:11.910
Thank you

06:52.178 --> 06:54.055
That's a long-ass piss.

07:45.699 --> 07:47.178
My turn.

07:47.267 --> 07:48.268
What's your status?

07:48.702 --> 07:50.978
Two minutes,

07:53.406 --> 07:54.817
- Hold your position, I'm coming.

07:54.874 --> 07:56.251
We'll rendezvous later.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.186
Mina.
Just do it!

07:58.478 --> 07:59.650
Activity in Sector C.

07:59.713 --> 08:00.817
Copy that.

08:04.417 --> 08:05.555
Ma'am.

08:17.664 --> 08:18.836
Ma'am.

08:24.270 --> 08:25.578
Oh!

08:25.805 --> 08:28.012
Security, we have a civ
unaccompanied on the base.

08:28.108 --> 08:30.145
I repeat, a civ
unaccompanied on the base.

08:30.210 --> 08:32.554
Where the fuck did she go? You
were supposed to be with her.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.854
I don't know'
she just disappeared.

08:44.924 --> 08:46.232
What the hell are
you doing in here?

08:46.493 --> 08:47.733
Just me.

08:50.764 --> 08:51.765
Drop your weapon!

09:03.176 --> 09:05.952
<i>We are Code Orange in Sector 3.
This is not a drill.</i>

09:19.726 --> 09:20.966
Show me
your fucking hands!

09:32.405 --> 09:33.509
Mina!

09:42.282 --> 09:43.522
Don't move!

09:44.084 --> 09:45.620
Put your fucking
hands up!

09:45.985 --> 09:47.362
Get 'em up!

09:48.388 --> 09:49.992
What do you want?

09:50.557 --> 09:52.002
Who sent you?

09:52.659 --> 09:54.400
It's nothing personal.

09:54.461 --> 09:56.099
What isn't personal?

09:59.732 --> 10:00.733
This.

10:05.972 --> 10:08.145
Mina, where are you?

10:08.475 --> 10:10.011
<i>Tatiana, go, save yourself.
It's too hot.</i>

10:10.110 --> 10:11.111
Mina.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.648
So, what's it gonna be?

11:18.711 --> 11:19.746
What's what gonna be?

11:19.846 --> 11:20.984
The new name of
the restaurant?

11:21.047 --> 11:22.390
I think the space is
too small for

11:22.482 --> 11:24.484
"Bitch Who Broke My Heart
and Took Half of My Shit."

11:24.551 --> 11:26.462
Dude“.
What? Too soon?

11:27.053 --> 11:30.227
You can change it to
Catalina Spanish Bitch-re.

11:30.323 --> 11:31.358
You know what
you need, man?

11:31.457 --> 11:33.869
You need to get out
of Brooklyn.

11:33.927 --> 11:35.668
Cat's gone, Jules,
that's a fact

11:35.728 --> 11:37.207
whether I'm here
or somewhere else.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.937
That's right, but, look,
we need to go somewhere' too.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.479
Take your mind off the whole
restaurant thing and this chick.

11:42.669 --> 11:45.309
Emmett' cut that on the bias. On the bias.
You know better.

11:45.371 --> 11:46.509
Yeah, chop, chop.

11:46.573 --> 11:48.917
- Hi' Michelle. Let's see what you've got.
- Looks good.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.319
Needs acid. Just a little
bit, though' okay?

11:53.379 --> 11:54.380
Sure.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.221
it needs sea salt.

11:56.583 --> 11:57.721
Hey, man. Uh“.

11:57.784 --> 11:58.956
You ever thought
about making short ribs

11:59.052 --> 12:01.396
or cooking burritos
or something? Mmm?

12:01.487 --> 12:03.057
Why don't you go
clean the dishes for me, man?

12:03.122 --> 12:04.260
Really?
Come on, lazy <i>ass.</i>

12:04.357 --> 12:06.200

12 Years a Slave.</i>

12:08.328 --> 12:10.205

Party of two for Friday.

12:14.133 --> 12:15.771
That's correct.

12:16.803 --> 12:19.113
I am looking for
Mr. Anthony Hester.

12:19.205 --> 12:20.377
I'm sorry,
sir, we're closed.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.750
I would like for it
to be a surprise.

12:23.509 --> 12:25.079
We're closed, sir.

12:25.345 --> 12:26.983
You can't go back there.

12:36.623 --> 12:38.000
Don't even try it!

12:39.559 --> 12:42.005

13:31.878 --> 13:34.154
Who that said, "They're

with the flat chests?

13:46.492 --> 13:47.527
You remember that.
That was good.

Look, my uncle

14:04.077 --> 14:06.216
and give us a home
base for the expo.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.791
All right.
Fuck it, New Orleans.

18:22.335 --> 18:24.337
Antoine, he made
these ribs.

18:24.570 --> 18:26.277
Okay? Come on.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.316
Lord, we would
like to thank you for

18:28.407 --> 18:30.182
bringing this strong
family together today.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.586
And thank you for the bounty
that you have placed upon us.

18:32.645 --> 18:33.953
In Jesus' name, amen.

18:34.046 --> 18:34.990
And thanks
for bringing the beer.

18:35.081 --> 18:36.116
So rude!

18:38.584 --> 18:40.063
Who made all this?

18:44.156 --> 18:45.726
I miss food.
Yeah.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.731
Hey, Big Ray, you tried
that sauce with the ribs?

18:48.828 --> 18:50.205
Oh, yeah. The sauce
was wonderful.

18:50.262 --> 18:51.297
Right?
Mmm-hmm.

18:51.364 --> 18:53.275
Did you try
that sauce?

18:53.332 --> 18:54.970
Did y'all try
the barbecue sauce?

18:55.067 --> 18:57.069
What are you doing with
yourself these days, Jackhole?

18:57.536 --> 18:59.914
Jay, um, lives
in New York.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.214
I'm a private investigator.

19:03.075 --> 19:05.021
- A what?
- A private dick.

19:06.545 --> 19:07.649
And, uh..

19:07.747 --> 19:10.318
Private detective,
or dick.

19:10.916 --> 19:13.692
I'm a dick, okay?
I'm a dick. All right?

19:14.787 --> 19:16.164
Bullshit.

19:18.357 --> 19:20.098
I don't know why
it's so funny. It's true.

19:20.159 --> 19:23.231
We have an office space
we just leased out.

19:23.496 --> 19:24.497
We solve cases.

19:24.563 --> 19:25.564
<i>Yes, we some oases.</i>

19:25.665 --> 19:26.769
We've gotten cases.

19:26.832 --> 19:28.539
How many cases?
A lot of cases.

19:28.634 --> 19:30.136
Yeah, we...
A lot of cases.

19:30.202 --> 19:32.148
We had one big case
that put us on the map.

19:32.238 --> 19:35.219
But then all of the rest of them
were like little branch cases.

19:35.307 --> 19:39.722
Uh, cheating husbands, alimony
checks not being there.

19:40.413 --> 19:43.951
Child support things, those cases.
We had a murder case.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.257
So' you're in people's
drawers and pocketbooks?

19:46.952 --> 19:50.422
Something like that. You know.
Hey, sex sells'

19:51.691 --> 19:53.432
What's the name of
this crackerjack outfit?

19:53.826 --> 19:55.430
It's called the Juan
Detective Agency.

19:55.795 --> 19:58.002
You and who else?

19:58.064 --> 19:59.805
You and who?

20:00.533 --> 20:02.376
You and me.
That's okay, Jackhole,

20:02.435 --> 20:04.278
y'all probably just
in it for the pussy.

20:05.271 --> 20:07.979
But that's a good reason
to be in anything.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.884
Ain't that right, baby'?
That's what I'm talking about.

20:13.746 --> 20:15.191
Hey' Hey.

20:15.981 --> 20:16.982
What's going on?

20:17.149 --> 20:19.060
From the Halls of Montezuma.
Wilson.

20:19.151 --> 20:21.028
- Hey, hey.
- What's up, man?

20:21.087 --> 20:22.191
I was wondering when
you were showing up.

20:22.254 --> 20:23.892
What's going on, man?

20:24.256 --> 20:25.701
You all right, brother?

20:25.758 --> 20:26.930
Hey, come and have
a seat, man.

20:27.026 --> 20:29.165
Excuse me for being rude.
I'm sorry.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.866
My military
friend here, Nina.

20:30.930 --> 20:31.908
Hi.

20:31.997 --> 20:33.533
Pleased to meet you.
Welcome.

20:33.866 --> 20:35.868
Come on in.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.856
<i>So you don't
remember anything?</i>

20:58.124 --> 20:59.501
It's just a blank.

21:01.193 --> 21:03.730
Doctors say that it probably
won't ever come back.

21:05.631 --> 21:08.077
But I saw
the official story,

21:08.134 --> 21:10.045
and it just doesn't
make any sense.

21:10.336 --> 21:12.282
They said it was
a training exercise.

21:12.505 --> 21:15.611
What kind of training exercise kills
the three highest-ranking officers,

21:15.674 --> 21:17.517
his sergeant
and a doggone“.

21:17.610 --> 21:18.611
Civilian.

21:18.677 --> 21:20.247
Yeah, a civilian.

21:20.412 --> 21:21.447
Civilian?

21:21.514 --> 21:22.515
Stripper.

21:25.084 --> 21:27.997
There's rumors going
around that she was...

21:28.587 --> 21:30.225
You know me' Jay.

21:31.924 --> 21:35.531
I love the ladies' but I
would never hurt nobody.

21:36.362 --> 21:37.898
You know that

21:39.665 --> 21:42.077
<i>Now, they're saying it's
some kind of gang rape gone wrong.</i>

21:42.434 --> 21:44.072
Now, look, my cousin
may have blue balls

21:44.136 --> 21:46.548
and absolutely zero game,
but he's no rapist.

21:47.339 --> 21:48.647
So you want
to clear his name?

21:48.707 --> 21:50.152
Yeah, and it wouldn't
hurt to gain some points

21:50.242 --> 21:51.312
with the southern
relations.

21:51.377 --> 21:53.857
Look, I know I got you into this
competition, and now I'm asking you to“.

21:53.946 --> 21:55.152
Nah, man, don't worry about that.
I'll drop out

21:55.247 --> 21:57.488
No, I'm not saying that
I'm saying we do both.

21:57.550 --> 22:00.360
I say we clear my cousin's
name and win the contest.

22:01.086 --> 22:02.394
What do you think?

22:03.956 --> 22:05.333
I say we got
our next case.

22:05.491 --> 22:06.629
My man.

22:06.692 --> 22:08.035
Let's go inside,
it's cold.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.508
You have failed
in your mission'

22:14.567 --> 22:16.513
The Wolf still
needs the plans.

22:20.739 --> 22:23.151
<i>That is courteous,
but unnecessary.</i>

22:23.509 --> 22:26.581
Mina's body and personal effects
have been moved off base.

22:27.980 --> 22:29.687
For the moment,
I do not know.

22:29.748 --> 22:30.988
But that will change.

22:31.383 --> 22:34.057
<i>Mina's body
cannot be autopsied</i>

22:34.153 --> 22:36.497
<i>or the nature of our gifts
will become known.</i>

22:36.555 --> 22:39.001
<i>And this will bring
unwanted attention.</i>

22:39.058 --> 22:40.867
<i>Is that clear?
Mmm.</i>

22:41.393 --> 22:43.031
<i>Expect my call.</i>

22:47.166 --> 22:48.167
Mina.

22:48.234 --> 22:51.511
<i>You need some positive
male attention for</i> a <i>change.</i>

23:22.067 --> 23:23.569

Mmm, Russia.

23:47.092 --> 23:48.469
I am from
Czech Republic.

23:48.661 --> 23:50.641
I like to play soccer.
You like soccer?

23:50.763 --> 23:52.674
I love dancing.

23:53.032 --> 23:54.602
And skiing.

23:54.667 --> 23:56.772
And, uh...

23:56.969 --> 23:58.448
Do you like Chekhov'?

23:59.038 --> 23:59.982
Who's Chekhov?

24:00.072 --> 24:02.518
Yes, the original
series Chekov.

24:02.608 --> 24:05.111
Not that douche from the J.J.
Abrams reboot.

24:05.511 --> 24:08.958
<i>My favorite of his would have

24:17.856 --> 24:20.302
I am hoping to be m
real estate one day.

24:20.392 --> 24:21.996
Do you like real estate?

24:22.261 --> 24:24.798
Um, I'd like to have
a house on the beach.

24:24.997 --> 24:27.238
You look like someone who would
do very well on a beach.

24:27.833 --> 24:29.870
That was very awkward.
I shouldn't say it that way.

24:30.002 --> 24:32.482
I'm just a fitness buff,
a gambling fiend.

24:32.538 --> 24:34.950
Go out every night and
try to pick up women.

24:35.007 --> 24:37.078
Uh, I'm a fashion designer.

24:37.142 --> 24:38.815

24:45.651 --> 24:48.257
Your chin is amazing.
My chin?

24:48.320 --> 24:49.492
It's a strong chin.

24:49.555 --> 24:51.501
I don't like these girls
who have the chins,

24:51.557 --> 24:53.798
they start over here
and go all the way down.

24:53.859 --> 24:55.839
I like your eyes a lot.

24:55.894 --> 24:56.998
My eyes or my ass?

24:57.096 --> 24:59.372
You have the most amazing
eyes I've ever seen.

24:59.465 --> 25:02.344
And I'm not a breast guy,
so I think we might work out.

25:03.435 --> 25:04.675

Depending on the threat
they pose to my employer.

26:39.998 --> 26:42.410
You know what,
I don't like this place.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.842

the music?

30:19.785 --> 30:21.162
What would you
like to hear?

30:21.219 --> 30:23.495
Just play
something different

30:34.666 --> 30:36.009
Is that good?

30:36.601 --> 30:38.842
I'm really not
into country music.

30:38.904 --> 30:40.440
Do you have
any classical?

30:43.075 --> 30:44.520

Hi-.

31:06.031 --> 31:09.274

It's a little cold.

31:11.103 --> 31:13.014
Look, Ludmila“.
Yes?

31:13.939 --> 31:15.941
You seem like
a really nice girl.

31:16.041 --> 31:19.352
I mean, maybe
a little high-maintenance,

31:20.645 --> 31:22.818
but I don't think
I'm ready for this.

31:22.881 --> 31:23.882
Sorry.

you know about it?

32:33.185 --> 32:35.722
I didn't want any
forensics tampered with.

32:37.088 --> 32:38.431
God bless the Corps,
but their brass

32:38.490 --> 32:39.662
ain't above
covering their asses.

32:40.892 --> 32:43.304
Plus, we got
appropriations coming up'

32:43.361 --> 32:45.204
Got to keep
things clean.

32:45.464 --> 32:46.568
Pull!

32:51.203 --> 32:54.343
Well, we'll have to
pick this up next time.

32:57.843 --> 32:58.913
Who?

33:01.379 --> 33:03.859
Coroner.
Plaquemines Parish.

33:04.950 --> 33:05.951
She'll be safe there.

33:12.224 --> 33:13.225
Pull!

33:26.872 --> 33:28.783
Ongoing investigation.

33:29.608 --> 33:30.712
Dead end.

33:30.809 --> 33:31.810
Ah, not necessarily.

33:31.877 --> 33:34.687
I asked him where a guy could go
to pay for some tail around here.

33:34.779 --> 33:36.656
She She's'?
Strip club?

33:37.015 --> 33:38.153
I think so.

33:38.216 --> 33:39.854
Big booties?
Big booties'

33:39.951 --> 33:41.396
You got singles?

33:52.430 --> 33:53.636
Hello.

33:54.366 --> 33:55.970
Yeah, I see 'em.

33:56.268 --> 33:57.576
Private eyes?

33:57.802 --> 33:59.110
I'll be back
in a sec.

33:59.404 --> 34:00.974
Hey, okay, now.

34:01.106 --> 34:02.676
Ooh. Don't throw it on me.

34:02.841 --> 34:04.445
It's my birthday.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.018
He's got a beard.

34:12.551 --> 34:14.292
What the fuck
do you want?

34:14.853 --> 34:15.888
You run this spot?

34:15.987 --> 34:18.991
It's my club. We don't
allow dicks back here.

34:19.123 --> 34:21.297
Especially no
private dicks.

34:21.693 --> 34:22.728
What do you
boys want?

34:22.827 --> 34:23.897
We want to know
about that escort

34:23.995 --> 34:25.099
that was killed
at Fort Polk.

34:25.196 --> 34:27.197
We got dancers here.

34:27.431 --> 34:28.706
Artistes.

34:29.134 --> 34:32.411
Girls want to push pussy on their
own time, that's their business.

34:32.469 --> 34:33.949
Kindly go
fuck yourselves.

34:34.039 --> 34:35.109
You know anybody
that'd want to hurt her?

34:35.206 --> 34:37.413
What did I say,
motherfucker?

34:41.146 --> 34:42.123
Let's get out of here.

34:42.213 --> 34:43.715
No, no, no. Hold up.

34:43.915 --> 34:46.259
One of the men that was wounded
that night was my cousin.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.261
Now somebody gonna give
me some damn information.

34:48.320 --> 34:50.561
I don't give a fuck if it
was your mama in drag.

34:50.621 --> 34:51.692
MY mama?

34:56.494 --> 34:57.598
Um, right by the balls.

35:00.865 --> 35:02.105
<i>W“ Wm gun.</i>

35:02.167 --> 35:03.874
Get your ass on your knees.
Get on your knees.

35:03.935 --> 35:06.040
Hey, big man!
Put him down.

35:06.504 --> 35:09.246
Get on your knees, too. Come
on, corn-fed. Hurry up.

35:09.941 --> 35:11.079
Uh...

35:11.142 --> 35:12.917
You can go on and go. It
might get a little bloody.

35:12.978 --> 35:15.288
Get a little blood
on your two-piece.

35:15.347 --> 35:17.793
I'm gonna send you a friend
request, though. Okay.

35:17.882 --> 35:19.452
Here, go on and take the gun.
That don't smell right.

35:19.718 --> 35:22.790
All right. I'm about to go
Helen Bingham on his ass.

35:22.887 --> 35:25.993
All right. Talk. Mmm.
Talk.

35:26.091 --> 35:29.595
It was two white girls. Russians,
come in from Galveston'

35:29.828 --> 35:31.432
It wasn't supposed
to go down like that

35:31.496 --> 35:32.497
What else,
motherfucker?

35:32.597 --> 35:34.133
I don't know shit
about the other girl.

35:34.199 --> 35:37.908
The one that got killed. They
moved her to Plaquemines Parish.

35:37.969 --> 35:39.073
Who told you that?

35:39.137 --> 35:40.741
Ifs professional
courtesy to”.

35:40.805 --> 35:42.478
Professional courtesy?

35:42.540 --> 35:44.076
Fuck! It was
Beau LaMonde.

35:44.142 --> 35:47.146
He's got a gator farm up
in Lake Pontchartrain.

35:47.846 --> 35:50.383
He loves to run his mouth when
his drawers getting worked on.

35:50.615 --> 35:52.117
I swear
that's all I got!

35:52.384 --> 35:54.159
That's all you got? Huh?
Mmm?

35:54.853 --> 35:56.696
That's all I got.

35:56.788 --> 35:58.233
You got a thong
on, too.

35:58.456 --> 36:00.493
Stay on your
fucking knees.

36:00.558 --> 36:01.696
Yeah.

36:04.929 --> 36:05.999
Why you got
a gold thong on?

36:06.498 --> 36:07.670
Fucking bastard.

36:07.766 --> 36:09.768
Let's go, man. Come on.
Let's get out of here.

36:11.670 --> 36:13.980
We got to make
a right or left?

36:15.240 --> 36:17.015
You got a GPS, man?

37:16.568 --> 37:19.276
"Mid 20s, excellent
physical condition.

37:19.471 --> 37:20.882
"Signs of pre-mortem
intercourse.

37:21.639 --> 37:23.050
"Contusions,
head and neck.

37:23.108 --> 37:25.748
"Multiple bullet wounds.
One fatal shot to the head."

37:25.844 --> 37:27.414
What are you
doing, man?

37:27.479 --> 37:29.481
What? Looking for
identifying marks'

37:33.017 --> 37:35.054
No tan lines,
nice body.

37:36.888 --> 37:39.767
Oh. Fully shaven.
Brazilian.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.234
Vag piercings.

37:43.461 --> 37:45.338
Not a stripper.

37:45.430 --> 37:46.670
Why do you say that?

37:46.765 --> 37:47.937
Well, because there's
too much hardware

37:48.032 --> 37:49.568
that gets tn the way
of the software.

37:49.868 --> 37:51.506
The piercings get caught
in a guy's teeth,

37:51.603 --> 37:53.776
sounds like a door knocker.

37:53.938 --> 37:55.508
He'd knock a nipple off.

37:55.607 --> 37:57.644
Catastrophe, he can't
make it ram like that.

37:59.043 --> 38:01.250
Pretty good hands,
nice hands.

38:01.312 --> 38:02.882
No nail polish.

38:04.916 --> 38:05.917
Hmm.

38:06.217 --> 38:08.163
This tattoo though.

38:08.253 --> 38:09.288
I've seen it before.

38:09.888 --> 38:11.060
Where?

38:12.223 --> 38:13.896
I don't remember.

38:16.528 --> 38:17.666
Um...

38:20.832 --> 38:22.470
Hit the lights.
Hit the lights!

38:25.637 --> 38:26.707
Uh...

38:29.107 --> 38:30.177
Hey, man, let me m.
Come on, man!

38:30.275 --> 38:31.310
There's no room, man.

38:31.376 --> 38:33.856
Get the fuck out of here.
Come on, man!

38:33.945 --> 38:35.185
Damn n.

38:37.849 --> 38:39.021
Whoa...

38:39.117 --> 38:41.119
Goodness! Oh, okay.

38:41.786 --> 38:42.821
Okay?-

39:28.600 --> 39:29.874
Oh, Lord.

39:53.725 --> 39:54.726
Oh, man.

40:35.767 --> 40:37.508
Hey, what you waiting for?

40:37.835 --> 40:40.042
Those girls definitely weren't strippers.
Yeah. I told you.

40:40.104 --> 40:42.516
I had to lay next to a dead guy.
He was musty.

40:42.607 --> 40:44.211
Bucket list, man.

40:45.743 --> 40:47.484
- Shit! Get down!
- Watch it!

40:47.578 --> 40:48.784
Hurry up!

40:57.221 --> 40:58.859
Oh, I think I got hit.

41:02.126 --> 41:03.867
Okay.

41:06.431 --> 41:07.432
Jay?

41:07.999 --> 41:09.808
Oh! Hey!

41:10.702 --> 41:11.680
What happened?

41:11.769 --> 41:14.272
Uh, just a little
complication in the case.

41:14.339 --> 41:15.340
Complication?

41:15.440 --> 41:16.817
Yeah. It's all good.

41:16.874 --> 41:17.978
Do you need some
help with that?

41:18.543 --> 41:20.352
Maybe.
Okay, great.

41:20.445 --> 41:22.186
Sit. Just sit down.
Okay.

41:22.280 --> 41:24.123
I'll be right back. Okay.
All right.

41:26.651 --> 41:28.289
Breathe, breathe.

41:29.787 --> 41:32.097
What are you doing?
Take your pants off.

41:32.423 --> 41:34.869
I've seen you with less
clothes on than that before.

41:34.959 --> 41:36.870
All right. Uh, okay.
Okay.

41:37.729 --> 41:41.472
I remember when you used to give
me looks when we were kids.

41:42.734 --> 41:45.681
I guess I was a little chubby
chaser back then, right?

41:45.737 --> 41:47.580
No, I mean, but
you've changed, girl!

41:47.872 --> 41:50.910
Tattoos and everything. I can do tats.
That's what I do now.

41:51.442 --> 41:55.913
Well, I admire a man
who will risk his life

41:56.547 --> 41:58.288
to save his family.

41:59.017 --> 42:02.555
What can I say? That's what I do.
I risk for the family.

42:05.923 --> 42:07.732
You really grew up.

42:15.400 --> 42:18.313
So, that's it. Julian's
cousin's completely innocent'

42:18.369 --> 42:19.848
Mmm, I knew n.

42:20.605 --> 42:23.051
But if you're just gonna
whack the top brass,

42:23.141 --> 42:24.381
why go somewhere
where you're guaranteed

42:24.475 --> 42:26.045
to get caught
and killed yourself?

42:26.144 --> 42:27.748
I think they were at the
base for something else.

42:27.779 --> 42:29.349
We just don't know what it is yet.

42:30.048 --> 42:31.425
My man.

42:31.516 --> 42:32.961
So, what's the bad news?

42:36.320 --> 42:37.765
What's the bad news?

42:40.324 --> 42:43.430
You and Jackhole let some
motherfucker shoot up my goddamn car?

42:44.762 --> 42:46.742
Oh, son of a bitch!

42:47.965 --> 42:49.876
If it makes you feel any better,
Jules got a flesh wound.

42:49.934 --> 42:50.912
Good, God damn it!

42:50.968 --> 42:52.811
Where's your motherfucking
flesh wound?

43:02.947 --> 43:05.393
If it wasn't
the Chinese,

43:05.450 --> 43:06.952
who were they?

43:08.953 --> 43:10.432
I don't know.

43:11.255 --> 43:14.259
But they obviously had
the same intel we did.

43:19.831 --> 43:22.437
Whoever" they were, you will
have to deal with them.

43:22.533 --> 43:25.377
And your former
employer, Mr, Cordray.

43:26.938 --> 43:30.408
I will inform the Wolf that
these plans are incomplete.

43:31.209 --> 43:33.587
We will have to
find another way.

43:56.934 --> 43:58.174
Boss.

43:58.269 --> 43:59.805
<i>Boss,</i> wake up.
Boss.

43:59.871 --> 44:01.646
What?
Camera three.

44:04.775 --> 44:06.584
Go check it out.

44:35.740 --> 44:36.912
Casey?

44:42.747 --> 44:43.919
Casey?

45:13.844 --> 45:15.323
Oh, fuck!

45:15.780 --> 45:16.781
Bitch!

45:17.315 --> 45:19.921
Two men who came by,
who were they?

45:21.886 --> 45:23.388
Who were they?

45:24.655 --> 45:27.135
Couple pie-ass Pls
from New York.

45:27.959 --> 45:30.064
I didn't tell
them nothing.

45:30.127 --> 45:31.401
I know what
you told them.

45:32.129 --> 45:33.938
You fucking shot me.

45:34.765 --> 45:36.972
I have something for the pain.

45:38.669 --> 45:40.740
This is how
I'm going out?

45:40.805 --> 45:41.909
Yes.

45:41.973 --> 45:43.509
No bitches
on my hp?

45:54.352 --> 45:55.831
Is that better?

45:56.287 --> 45:58.130
Actually, yeah.

46:00.625 --> 46:03.105
I want you to know

46:03.160 --> 46:04.935
it's nothing personal.

46:04.996 --> 46:06.100
I don't give a...

46:54.879 --> 46:55.880
Sounds good.

46:56.414 --> 46:58.155
Thank you, partner.

46:59.317 --> 47:01.024
Hey, Big Ray,
let me ask you a question.

47:01.118 --> 47:02.688
Hit me, Antoine.

47:02.787 --> 47:04.494
Remember those, uh,
ribs that I made?

47:04.588 --> 47:05.692
Yeah.

47:07.124 --> 47:08.194
What was wrong
with them?

47:09.293 --> 47:12.331
Well, there was nothing
wrong with them exactly.

47:12.430 --> 47:15.309
In fact, I don't think I've ever
had a rib sauce so precise.

47:16.634 --> 47:18.705
What they lacked was

47:18.803 --> 47:20.874
passion, spontaneity.

47:21.439 --> 47:24.477
See, there's three things
in life you got to riff,

47:24.542 --> 47:27.785
Cooking, playing jazz,
and fucking.

47:28.512 --> 47:29.616
So, what do I do'?

47:30.147 --> 47:31.683
Man, you know how
to fuck, don't you?

47:31.782 --> 47:33.784
Good-looking white boy like
you must get plenty of tail.

47:34.051 --> 47:35.155
See, you got to...

47:36.087 --> 47:38.226
You got to give
yourself over to it.

47:38.522 --> 47:40.798
Just riff' brother.
Just riff.

47:43.094 --> 47:44.368
I don't really do that

47:44.695 --> 47:47.539
Yeah. Well, the levees
wasn't built in a day.

47:47.631 --> 47:49.201
I can help you with
the cooking and the jazz,

47:49.266 --> 47:52.338
but the fucking you got to
do on your own.

47:52.403 --> 47:54.474
See, it's like this. It's about the...
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

47:54.638 --> 47:56.675
About the...

47:57.108 --> 47:58.485
When you get the good
food, you say...

47:58.542 --> 48:00.021
Mmm.

48:00.478 --> 48:03.254
Right? And when you get
the good jazz, you say...

48:03.347 --> 48:04.485
Mmm!
Mmm!

48:04.915 --> 48:06.053
And, boy' you get
that good pussy,

48:06.117 --> 48:08.119
it's sure gonna
make you say.“

48:08.219 --> 48:09.391
Mmm!
Mmm!

48:09.553 --> 48:11.499
Let's go back to the...

48:11.589 --> 48:12.590
Come on.

48:14.859 --> 48:16.930
That's what I'm talking about.
Then you got to say“.

48:17.361 --> 48:18.396
Mmm!

48:18.496 --> 48:19.941
I feel dirty.
I feel dirty now.

48:20.030 --> 48:21.566
Grab your nuts.
Grab your nuts.

48:21.899 --> 48:23.071
Hold on to them nuts,
say... Mmm!

48:23.401 --> 48:24.402
Mmm!

48:24.902 --> 48:26.142
Mmm!
Mmm!

48:26.570 --> 48:27.674
One more time, say...

48:28.305 --> 48:29.306
Mmm!

48:30.207 --> 48:32.551
<i>Baby, you go!
that good pussy</i>

48:32.610 --> 48:34.681
<i>Oh, yeah, that's what
I'm talking about</i>

48:35.513 --> 48:39.928
<i>Spread them pretty legs And let
me sink between them, yeah</i>

48:41.786 --> 48:43.993
<i>Oh, baby!</i>

48:44.522 --> 48:47.162
<i>Oh, baby!</i>

48:47.725 --> 48:49.136
I think I'm ready.
I think I'm ready.

48:49.226 --> 48:50.603
Let me hear that fucking.

48:50.694 --> 48:51.695
Mmm!

48:51.996 --> 48:53.998
Ow!
Ow!

48:54.098 --> 48:55.975
And finally you say“.

49:03.874 --> 49:04.818
All right, all right.

49:04.909 --> 49:06.479
You got it, baby.

49:06.577 --> 49:07.885
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

49:07.912 --> 49:09.619
Let me make you some breakfast, yeah?
All right.

49:09.713 --> 49:11.090
What do you want?
What do you want?

49:11.148 --> 49:12.252
Some pussy.

49:59.597 --> 50:02.168
Welcome to
the Barataria Bayou Barn!

50:05.236 --> 50:06.408
I'm Guy Mancini.

50:06.804 --> 50:09.341
<i>And</i> this <i>is
Americana Chophouse!</i>

50:10.708 --> 50:13.188
Today on the Chophouse,
we are going to feed you

50:13.244 --> 50:16.350
the filet mignon
of the bayou.

50:16.413 --> 50:18.154
The American alligator.

50:18.382 --> 50:19.793
We are going
to cue 'em

50:19.850 --> 50:22.057
and stew 'em and feed
'em to you good folks.

50:22.152 --> 50:25.190
And this particular gator that
we're going to enjoy today

50:25.256 --> 50:27.202
came right out of
the bayous behind us.

50:30.628 --> 50:31.732
Before we go
any further though,

50:31.829 --> 50:32.899
I would also like
to say thanks

50:32.997 --> 50:35.443
to the man who provided us with
the space and the game today,

50:35.533 --> 50:37.274
Mr. Beau LaMonde.

50:37.368 --> 50:39.644
Looking very sharp
back there.

50:39.703 --> 50:41.705
Wail.
Isn't he the one.“

50:41.805 --> 50:44.012
Cordray mentioned. Probably
tipped off the assassins.

50:44.074 --> 50:45.815
Go try and
get close to him.

50:45.876 --> 50:47.253
Well,
first things first

50:47.344 --> 50:48.721
Got to have a nice,
sharp knife.

50:48.812 --> 50:51.349
So, we're going to
start up here, high.

50:51.448 --> 50:52.893
- Can you hang on to it for me?
- Yeah.

50:52.983 --> 50:54.826
Keep this thing from
spinning right here.

50:58.355 --> 50:59.459
It's like that saying.

50:59.557 --> 51:02.037
"Bravest man I ever saw, the
first to eat an oyster raw."

51:02.092 --> 51:03.901
I'd like to see the first guy who
wrestled one of these things

51:03.994 --> 51:06.065
and go, "I'm hungry."

51:06.130 --> 51:09.543
You got to go on in there, you
got to go through the rib cage.

51:09.833 --> 51:11.403
But you don't want to
bypass the stomach either.

51:11.468 --> 51:13.573
'Cause we found a 12-pound
catfish in one of them one time.

51:13.671 --> 51:16.743
We smoked it up with some pecan shells.
It was delicious.

51:16.840 --> 51:19.013
Okay, here we go.

51:20.044 --> 51:22.217
Feel around in the stomach right there.
You see it?

51:22.279 --> 51:23.280
See the stomach
right there?

51:23.380 --> 51:25.223
Feel around, see if you can
find anything in there.

51:26.016 --> 51:27.120
You feel anything?

51:27.685 --> 51:28.891
I got something solid.

51:28.953 --> 51:30.626
Well, it could be a turtle.
They eat those whole.

51:30.721 --> 51:32.291
You can make
a soup out of that

51:32.389 --> 51:33.390
No, I don't think
it's a turtle.

51:33.457 --> 51:34.595
Let's see.
Can you get it out?

51:34.692 --> 51:36.296
It's not a turtle.

51:36.393 --> 51:37.394
Hmm.

51:39.029 --> 51:40.337
Oh-ho!

51:40.431 --> 51:41.432
ANTHONY; Fuck.

51:41.498 --> 51:42.704
Whoa,
that's not a turtle.

51:42.766 --> 51:45.144
Let's, uh,
put that in a pan.

51:46.770 --> 51:48.875
Never found one
of those before.

51:49.039 --> 51:51.280
That's... Getting a little
too curious about...

52:02.353 --> 52:05.493
What is it?
Are you missing somebody?

52:05.589 --> 52:07.068
Whoa, what's up,
Beau? What is that?

52:07.124 --> 52:09.764
I'm cutting open a gator, I'm cooking this food.
What the hell is that?

52:10.194 --> 52:12.936
That was definitely that
girl from the morgue's hand.

52:12.997 --> 52:14.169
She had the tattoo.

52:14.264 --> 52:17.006
She also had these
weird metallic implants.

52:17.101 --> 52:18.341
Wasn't on the
coroner's report.

52:19.269 --> 52:21.340
That ought to raise
a red flag at Homicide.

52:23.774 --> 52:24.809
Or not.

52:25.509 --> 52:26.647
JULIAN; What was that?

52:26.744 --> 52:28.849
That's Louisiana
justice.

52:29.079 --> 52:30.217
We got to get by
that water, man

52:30.314 --> 52:31.918
There's going to be more
evidence around there.

52:32.016 --> 52:34.326
The water? Like, where
the gators are? Yeah.

52:34.385 --> 52:36.365
And they're doing gator shit,
like devouring human parts?

52:36.453 --> 52:39.400
You know what we gotta do over there, right?
We're gonna look.

52:39.490 --> 52:40.764
No, you going
to look over there.

52:40.791 --> 52:42.464
Hell' no, I'm not going there.
We're both going over.

52:42.526 --> 52:43.561
Come on. Let's go.
What?

52:43.661 --> 52:44.867
Man' I hate gators.

52:52.236 --> 52:53.681
<i>SECURITY' Sir,
I can't understand you.</i>

52:55.239 --> 52:56.240
<i>What?</i>

52:58.342 --> 52:59.844
<i>Could you speak
English please?</i>

53:04.248 --> 53:05.852
They probably dumped
the body over by the bridge.

53:06.984 --> 53:08.019
Just keep
your eyes open, all right?

53:08.118 --> 53:09.791
I got 'em open.
I'm looking.

53:10.220 --> 53:12.791
I don't like the look
of this water.

53:16.593 --> 53:19.039
Shit, look. It's right there.
See?

53:19.596 --> 53:20.870
See what?

53:26.804 --> 53:28.078
You want me to what?

53:32.509 --> 53:33.579
Like kill 'em?

53:36.246 --> 53:37.224
You understand that?

53:37.281 --> 53:38.385
I'm going to send
the other two dudes.

53:38.615 --> 53:42.392
We got two creepers on the
northwest side of Upper Kenter.

53:42.453 --> 53:43.830
Take 'em out.

53:45.055 --> 53:46.056
Them two dudes.

53:47.624 --> 53:48.625
Look at 'em.

53:49.159 --> 53:50.399
Little mini steps.

53:50.461 --> 53:51.462
Creeping-

53:55.833 --> 53:57.437
I can't get wet.

53:59.069 --> 54:00.480
I can't believe you're
making me do this, man.

54:00.571 --> 54:01.914
I thought our friendship
meant more.

54:02.106 --> 54:04.916
You know the largest gator ever
found was 1809, Louisiana.

54:05.275 --> 54:06.913
Really?
19 feet, 1,000 pounds.

54:07.244 --> 54:09.747
Okay, that's not cool, man.
Wrong timing.

54:09.847 --> 54:11.485
Give me your hand.

54:13.884 --> 54:15.420
Oh, fuck!

54:15.486 --> 54:16.931
- Reach.
- Pull, pull!

54:17.221 --> 54:19.258
It was your idea, you know.

54:21.125 --> 54:22.604
Dude, don't
let me fucking...

54:23.961 --> 54:25.338
Grab it.
I got it. Fuck.

54:25.796 --> 54:29.334
Dude, this is the same one that
we found in that girl's hand.

54:30.100 --> 54:32.102
Pull me out, man.
Hey, is that a gator?

54:36.440 --> 54:38.078
Pull me, man! Pull me!

54:39.576 --> 54:41.146
Oh, Shit! Shit! Pull!

54:41.245 --> 54:42.986
Go, go, go, man!
Come on!

54:43.647 --> 54:46.526
Come on. Come on!
Come on, run!

54:46.917 --> 54:48.157
Come on.

54:51.588 --> 54:52.692
Come on.

54:54.925 --> 54:56.802
You know how to drive one of these?
My cousin had one.

54:56.894 --> 54:58.703
Come on, come on.
Lay low!

54:59.229 --> 55:01.231
Push, man, push!
Come on!

55:12.643 --> 55:14.384
Where should we go? I don't know!
Just keep going!

55:17.915 --> 55:21.294
Hey, skeletal augmentation
with titanium alloy.

55:21.718 --> 55:23.857
These are not ordinary
assassins, man.

55:32.496 --> 55:33.873
Who's that?
Can you see?

55:37.568 --> 55:39.946
- Holy shit!
- She's shooting.

55:41.038 --> 55:42.210
Go this way!
Go down that canal.

55:42.673 --> 55:44.550
Fuck, I don't Know
where this leads, man.

56:00.591 --> 56:01.763
Push it faster!

56:06.129 --> 56:07.301
Anthony' faster!

56:17.441 --> 56:19.352
You missed us, bitch!
We're out of here!

56:27.317 --> 56:28.421
Wait a minute.
She's gaining on us.

56:28.518 --> 56:30.088
She's got the scope.
Come on!

56:35.058 --> 56:38.062
You gotta go side to side. Side to side!
We gotta shake them!

56:39.897 --> 56:40.898
We're not
losing her!

56:40.998 --> 56:42.944
I think there's something up here.
Make a left.

56:44.234 --> 56:46.180
Hold on, man!
Hold on!

56:55.779 --> 56:57.122
Hold on! Hold on!

56:57.214 --> 56:58.352
Can't this thing
go faster?

57:01.585 --> 57:02.723
Big bump! Hold on!

57:15.966 --> 57:17.673
Motherfucker! Yeah!
Whoo!

57:23.774 --> 57:24.844
Fuck!

57:26.843 --> 57:27.947
Bio-enhanced assassins.

57:28.045 --> 57:29.388
That's some real
black ops shit.

57:29.446 --> 57:31.448
Who are they? What did
they want at Fort Polk?

57:31.515 --> 57:33.654
I've been thinking,
maybe it's some kind of

57:33.750 --> 57:35.787
ultra high-tech
weapons system.

57:35.852 --> 57:37.229
And I've been
thinking about that tattoo.

57:37.688 --> 57:40.430
I know I've seen it
somewhere, like, on a woman.

57:41.525 --> 57:42.629
I'm gonna need your
help remembering that.

57:42.693 --> 57:43.797
Yeah.

57:43.860 --> 57:46.306
Last year, my physics
adviser had a meeting

57:46.396 --> 57:47.704
with some researchers
at Fort Pork'

57:47.798 --> 57:48.970
- and he came back and he...
- Simone.

57:49.232 --> 57:51.337
You mind if we talk
about this later?

57:52.235 --> 57:54.476
Okay, sure.
I'm gonna be in my room.

57:55.505 --> 57:56.506
All right. You ready
to get to work?

57:56.606 --> 57:58.085
Yeah. Cue the music,
let's do it.

58:01.878 --> 58:03.414
Baby, get it right there.

58:06.650 --> 58:07.651
Oh.

58:07.718 --> 58:08.822
Hey.

58:09.886 --> 58:10.990
What is going on here?

58:12.122 --> 58:14.159
Ah, how do
I say this?

58:14.358 --> 58:16.634
Julian's got what he calls
a pornographic memory.

58:17.728 --> 58:19.264
You mean
photographic memory?

58:19.329 --> 58:20.330
ANTHONY; No.

58:20.564 --> 58:23.204
Total sexual recall. He says he can
literally never forget a fuck.

58:23.300 --> 58:25.211
I need quiet.

58:25.469 --> 58:27.278
Right now he's going
through his memory banks.

58:27.337 --> 58:28.475
For fun?

58:28.538 --> 58:29.915
For the job.

58:30.907 --> 58:32.318
Okay, okay.

58:32.576 --> 58:35.557
You're saying he's going
into this memory of his

58:35.645 --> 58:38.854
and recalling all the girls
he's ever slept with?

58:39.282 --> 58:40.886
How long could
that possibly take?

58:41.885 --> 58:43.228
Oh. Ooh.

58:46.023 --> 58:47.764
You got 15 minutes.

58:50.160 --> 58:52.231
Oh, do that right there.
Ooh, girl!

58:56.299 --> 58:58.472
<i>Oh, yeah,
I remember that night.</i>

58:58.835 --> 59:00.872
<i>She had so many tattoos.</i>

59:00.937 --> 59:03.144
<i>She had, like,
Egyptian hieroglyphics.</i>

59:03.774 --> 59:06.778
<i>"Savage North“ or "South,"
or something like that.</i>

59:07.344 --> 59:08.721
<i>No. That's not it.</i>

59:08.779 --> 59:10.258
<i>Jessica, I remember her.</i>

59:11.081 --> 59:13.789
<i>Yeah. She kind of had
a little mustache, but...</i>

59:14.317 --> 59:15.557
<i>No, that wasn't</i> a <i>tattoo.</i>

59:15.619 --> 59:17.098
<i>- Ah, twerking Tina.</i>
- Yeah.

59:17.187 --> 59:19.167
<i>Yes. Twerking Tina.
Where's that tattoo?</i>

59:19.222 --> 59:20.963
<i>No, she had
a butterﬂy. Oh!</i>

59:21.324 --> 59:23.930
<i>My Asian persuasion.
The tramp stamp.</i>

59:24.494 --> 59:25.598
And the sleeve.

59:25.762 --> 59:27.639
<i>Oh, but she would
slap so hard.</i>

59:28.965 --> 59:30.501
<i>No, damn it!</i>

59:31.268 --> 59:32.508
Ooh.

59:32.569 --> 59:35.413
<i>Flapjacks. Yes, I know
she had</i> a <i>tattoo.</i>

59:35.639 --> 59:37.550
<i>Oh, it was a rose.</i>

59:37.607 --> 59:39.052
<i>I'm looking for
that damn scorpion.</i>

59:39.976 --> 59:41.046
<i>Oh, yes!</i>

59:41.178 --> 59:42.748
<i>The two wild shippers.</i>

59:43.280 --> 59:44.782
<i>They had
a lot of tattoos.</i>

59:45.048 --> 59:47.221
<i>What were their tattoos'?
Oh, that's right.</i>

59:47.284 --> 59:49.958
<i>What did she have, like a
magic dragon or something?</i>

59:50.353 --> 59:52.094
<i>No, it wasn't</i> a <i>scorpion.</i>

59:52.189 --> 59:53.725
<i>Oh, but she was
working her body.</i>

59:53.790 --> 59:56.066
<i>Then we went to Pinkberry
after that.</i>

59:56.126 --> 59:57.764
Ooh, Simone.

59:57.828 --> 59:59.830
<i>JULIAN' Girl,
you slimmed up.</i>

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:02.140
<i>What was
you doing, Herbalife?</i>

01:00:02.232 --> 01:00:05.213
<i>Oh, yeah. She had a fire dragon.
it was like a phoenix.</i>

01:00:06.002 --> 01:00:07.743
No!

01:00:07.804 --> 01:00:09.249
You are so bad.

01:00:09.306 --> 01:00:12.082
<i>She didn't have</i> a <i>tattoo,
why is she in this sequence?</i>

01:00:12.242 --> 01:00:13.448
Get me out of here!

01:00:14.111 --> 01:00:15.146
Oh!

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:18.551
How long was I under?

01:00:18.682 --> 01:00:19.854
Three hours.
Any luck?

01:00:20.851 --> 01:00:22.762
No, wrong context

01:00:23.386 --> 01:00:25.457
Simone, you said you,
uh, know a professor

01:00:25.555 --> 01:00:26.761
who did some work
at Fort Polk?

01:00:26.823 --> 01:00:28.666
Oh, yeah.
My physics advisor.

01:00:29.159 --> 01:00:30.502
He wanted
to get physical.

01:00:30.861 --> 01:00:32.704
I didn't do it.
I could've got an A.

01:00:37.634 --> 01:00:40.240
They offered me a lot of money for a
few equations, and I turned them down.

01:00:40.303 --> 01:00:43.045
So, uh, what they were making
was pretty expensive, huh?

01:00:44.007 --> 01:00:45.953
It was revolutionary.

01:00:46.109 --> 01:00:47.486
But by now I'm sure
it's being developed

01:00:47.577 --> 01:00:48.647
by every
industrialized country

01:00:48.712 --> 01:00:50.692
and every big corporation
with a robotics division.

01:00:51.014 --> 01:00:52.721
I heard the Chinese
are particularly interested.

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:55.594
Enough to hire assassins
to infiltrate a US base?

01:00:58.355 --> 01:00:59.891
That's about as much as
I'm comfortable saying.

01:01:00.724 --> 01:01:03.830
Anyway, remind Simone she
owes me, uh, extra credit.

01:01:03.894 --> 01:01:05.840
Okay.
Thanks for your time.

01:01:05.896 --> 01:01:06.966
Appreciate n.
Mmm-hmm.

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:09.442
All right. Get that
extra credit, huh?

01:01:37.294 --> 01:01:38.329
<i>Ms. Wollcrofl.</i>

01:01:38.395 --> 01:01:39.465
Professor Gussain.

01:01:39.629 --> 01:01:40.664
How can I help you?

01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:42.869
<i>Thefts of ballistic software
in Mumbai seven months ago,</i>

01:01:42.933 --> 01:01:45.379
Stockholm two months ago, now a
failed attempt at Fort Polk'

01:01:45.468 --> 01:01:47.311
<i>Is there</i>
a <i>question here?</i>

01:01:47.671 --> 01:01:49.912
<i>I want to know what
you people are up to.</i>

01:01:50.006 --> 01:01:53.078
Ask yourself if that's something
you'd really like to Know.

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:55.113
<i>Because I can oblige you.</i>

01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:56.914
<i>Others are beginning
10 find out.</i>

01:01:57.247 --> 01:01:59.056
Do yourself a favor,
Professor,

01:01:59.115 --> 01:02:01.425
leave others to
the professionals.

01:02:01.518 --> 01:02:02.792
Good day.

01:02:15.265 --> 01:02:16.903
It is gone.

01:02:19.402 --> 01:02:20.938
Worried about
your safety?

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:23.778
That is good.
You should be.

01:02:24.808 --> 01:02:26.617
The Wolf needs you.

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:28.245
To do what?

01:02:28.345 --> 01:02:30.689
Extrapolate from
incomplete blueprints.

01:02:32.082 --> 01:02:34.062
Fill in what
we are missing.

01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:49.600
As of this morning, Fort
Polk will no longer house

01:02:49.699 --> 01:02:51.645
the military's exo-project.

01:02:52.235 --> 01:02:55.011
Security there is about as
tight as my wife's rear end.

01:02:58.541 --> 01:03:00.316
I had a feeling
you'd ask me that

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:03.557
Turns out that girl's body
up and walked off after all.

01:03:03.747 --> 01:03:05.624
Right after I told you
where she was.

01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:13.924
Now you, son,
are not your daddy.

01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:16.334
Frankly, I don't know
what you are.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:19.566
I do Know your
ambitions go beyond his,

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:22.576
and it's got you mixed up with
folks he wouldn't approve of.

01:03:26.202 --> 01:03:29.012
As chair of the Senate committee
on national security,

01:03:29.105 --> 01:03:30.778
I know a hell of a lot.

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:34.451
Take my advice,

01:03:34.511 --> 01:03:35.956
don't leave
the country.

01:03:36.212 --> 01:03:37.657
Wouldn't want to have
to serve an indictment

01:03:37.747 --> 01:03:39.784
to some spider
hole somewhere.

01:03:40.850 --> 01:03:42.523
Go on,
we're done here.

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:44.799
Go on with you now. Go on.

01:03:45.889 --> 01:03:47.163
Motherfucker.

01:03:56.866 --> 01:03:58.311
Yes, this is Dragovic.

01:03:58.368 --> 01:03:59.847
Keep working.

01:04:05.542 --> 01:04:07.078
<i>What did you say?</i>

01:04:08.645 --> 01:04:10.056
<i>What did you say'!?</i>

01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:14.218
<i>What did you say'!?</i>

01:04:52.655 --> 01:04:53.690
Yeah.

01:04:53.757 --> 01:04:55.759
<i>New orders
from the Wolf.</i>

01:04:55.925 --> 01:04:59.099
You are going to pay a
visit to Senator Barnes.

01:04:59.696 --> 01:05:01.869
And thus time,
Tatiana,

01:05:01.931 --> 01:05:03.501
do not fuck it up.

01:05:04.067 --> 01:05:06.877
Who has jurisdiction over Fort Polk?
Non-military, I mean.

01:05:06.936 --> 01:05:08.415
Senator James Barnes.

01:05:08.505 --> 01:05:10.041
All right, we're
gonna hit Barnes' office

01:05:10.106 --> 01:05:12.245
in Baton Rouge
in the morning'

01:05:12.308 --> 01:05:14.845
Wait, Barnes is in
town this weekend.

01:05:15.211 --> 01:05:16.952
Today's the annual
gala for Tulane alumni.

01:05:17.046 --> 01:05:18.252
Gussain is supposed
to go.

01:05:19.516 --> 01:05:20.517
Hmm.

01:05:21.684 --> 01:05:24.130
Whoa! She got
those Helen Binghams.

01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:27.099
Wow. You really
don't stop, do you?

01:05:27.323 --> 01:05:30.600
What? Hang on, no. I know
where I saw that tattoo.

01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:32.873
Oh, shit.
Bingham.

01:05:35.565 --> 01:05:38.546
Pay attention. I have a
little business to attend to.

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:41.180
Catalina, take this.

01:05:42.572 --> 01:05:43.642
Look after Mummy,
will you?

01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:45.117
<i>Of course. The Order
of the Ghost Scorpion.</i>

01:05:45.408 --> 01:05:46.978
Order of
the what now?

01:05:47.076 --> 01:05:48.919
It was this
post-Cold War experiment,

01:05:48.978 --> 01:05:51.720
<i>an attempt to fill the power
vacuum after the Wall came down'</i>

01:05:51.781 --> 01:05:54.261
<i>An international consortium
of assassins.</i>

01:06:01.825 --> 01:06:02.826
Here.

01:06:09.299 --> 01:06:11.040
Do you need
a moment?

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:15.177
What did you
say your name was?

01:06:15.338 --> 01:06:17.579
Bingham.
Helen Bingham.

01:06:18.575 --> 01:06:20.452
<i>ANTHONY'. Bojan Dragovic
was a godfather and guru.</i>

01:06:21.044 --> 01:06:22.216
An expert in
irregular warfare

01:06:22.312 --> 01:06:23.757
and bio-enhancement
technologies.

01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:25.315
The titanium bones.
That's right.

01:06:25.381 --> 01:06:27.452
<i>He created a cadre
of super-assassins.</i>

01:06:32.388 --> 01:06:34.664
<i>After the oligarchs bought
out Russian intelligence,</i>

01:06:34.757 --> 01:06:37.169
<i>Dragovic brought the organization
into the private sector,</i>

01:06:37.227 --> 01:06:39.332
<i>working with whoever
was willing to pay.</i>

01:06:39.395 --> 01:06:42.399
<i>Most recently,</i> a <i>financier
known as the Wolf.</i>

01:06:42.832 --> 01:06:44.175
How do you
know all this?

01:06:44.234 --> 01:06:47.340
I just know where to look,
Tor, Deep Web' Wikipedia.

01:06:59.082 --> 01:07:00.686
What? What is it?

01:07:00.783 --> 01:07:03.423
Uh, it's Professor Gussain.

01:07:03.686 --> 01:07:05.256
Mmm.
It's for you.

01:07:05.822 --> 01:07:07.699
The Wolf plans to
kill Barnes today.

01:07:07.790 --> 01:07:10.634
I got to get this number to Barnes'
security, Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.030
Gussain contacted us.

01:07:12.095 --> 01:07:13.073
So what?

01:07:13.162 --> 01:07:14.835
That means he's too scared
to contact anyone else.

01:07:14.898 --> 01:07:16.275
Even the Senator's
security.

01:07:16.366 --> 01:07:17.970
The Wolf's got
people everywhere.

01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:19.877
If we're going to do something,
we've got to do it on our own.

01:07:19.969 --> 01:07:21.004
Where's this gala at?

01:07:23.806 --> 01:07:27.344
Still so much like the intern
I took on 20 years ago.

01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:30.289
You couldn't take no for
an answer then either.

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:34.527
I suppose that's part of your
appeal to your investors.

01:07:34.984 --> 01:07:36.861
I'm glad you made
it tonight' James.

01:07:36.986 --> 01:07:38.761
After our last meeting“.
Oh, oh, oh.

01:07:38.855 --> 01:07:41.927
Even old friends don't
always see eye-to-eye.

01:07:42.992 --> 01:07:45.996
I hope you don't need my
affirmation anymore, Hannah.

01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:49.009
No' but I'll always
need your vote, Senator.

01:07:50.533 --> 01:07:51.773
Ah.

01:07:52.068 --> 01:07:54.139
If you'll excuse me.
Of course.

01:07:55.071 --> 01:07:56.744
This is Hannah Wollcrcft.

01:07:57.373 --> 01:07:59.319
Yes, I'll take
the call.

01:08:12.555 --> 01:08:13.761
Hey, what time
are we starting at?

01:08:13.856 --> 01:08:14.926
Already started, man.

01:08:15.024 --> 01:08:16.264
Oh, shit.

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:18.170
Play it cool. Play it cool.
Play it cool.

01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:21.241
I need to see some IDs.

01:08:21.296 --> 01:08:24.437
You
know, she got my ID.

01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:26.639
Oh!
You got the“.

01:08:26.736 --> 01:08:29.182
I keep 'em in here.
 Mmm-hmm.

01:08:29.272 --> 01:08:30.944
Yeah, I left them at home. What?

01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:32.178
Girl, check
the left titty.

01:08:32.508 --> 01:08:33.509
Check the left titty.

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:35.647
You need ID just to get
into a wedding reception?

01:08:35.745 --> 01:08:38.122
Oh, no, wedding reception
is right around this corner.

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:39.251
First floor,
the Bayou Room.

01:08:39.314 --> 01:08:40.316
Great,
thank you.

01:08:40.416 --> 01:08:41.656
Take care, guys. Let
me see your ID, man.

01:08:41.751 --> 01:08:43.127
- You really work here?
- Bye!

01:08:43.185 --> 01:08:45.928
And these spots normally
have rooms we can cut through, so...

01:08:45.988 --> 01:08:48.492
Yeah, we'll go. We'll
find another way through.

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:49.591
JULIAN; All right.

01:08:50.526 --> 01:08:54.633
Whoever would've guessed me
tossing Terrible Timmy out of the ring

01:08:54.731 --> 01:08:57.075
would literally land
him in the lap of love?

01:08:59.202 --> 01:09:01.011
Look at this couple,
aren't they great?

01:09:01.104 --> 01:09:03.140
Hey, man, high five.
Look at this hot couple.

01:09:03.206 --> 01:09:04.844
I mean, come on.

01:09:07.743 --> 01:09:09.223
Enough of me
and the word games.

01:09:09.312 --> 01:09:11.189
Let's hear some of
Tina and Tim's friends'

01:09:11.279 --> 01:09:13.089
words of
encouragement and love.

01:09:13.383 --> 01:09:16.694
You, sir, you. Red tie,
come here for a second.

01:09:16.786 --> 01:09:18.787
You. Come here.

01:09:19.022 --> 01:09:20.023
You sure you want me?

01:09:20.122 --> 01:09:21.966
Just say something
about this great couple.

01:09:22.091 --> 01:09:23.627
No, you.

01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:30.544
Well, uh...

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:34.206
What can I say about the
bride and groom, right,

01:09:34.303 --> 01:09:36.214
that hasn't already
been said, huh?

01:09:37.407 --> 01:09:39.978
Well, I met...

01:09:41.144 --> 01:09:43.215
Tim.
Tim?

01:09:43.312 --> 01:09:45.349
Met Tim in a, uh..

01:09:45.782 --> 01:09:49.854
A mini-bar
in Little Tokyo,

01:09:50.219 --> 01:09:53.689
and we got into some small
talk' had some short ribs.

01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:56.027
And what can I say
about the bride, right?

01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:59.572
She's so effervescent.

01:10:00.396 --> 01:10:02.137
Tina?

01:10:03.366 --> 01:10:04.868
Tina?
Yeah.

01:10:04.967 --> 01:10:06.708
Twerking Tina?

01:10:06.803 --> 01:10:08.180
It is a small world.

01:10:08.237 --> 01:10:09.443
You know what I mean.

01:10:10.907 --> 01:10:15.583
Tina and I, uh,
met at a strip club...

01:10:15.812 --> 01:10:18.418
Mall. Strip mall,
met at a strip mall.

01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:19.856
And, um...

01:10:20.016 --> 01:10:22.223
I always said,
with that kind of ass“.

01:10:22.285 --> 01:10:26.461
Assets. She has many assets
that work in her favor.

01:10:26.823 --> 01:10:31.465
And I always thought that she
was destined for big things.

01:10:31.694 --> 01:10:35.073
Obviously, we all know that big
things come in small packages.

01:10:35.164 --> 01:10:36.734
Or smaller
packages, right?

01:10:36.833 --> 01:10:38.574
Anyways, do you
still have that tattoo?

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:43.244
She has a great
tattoo of a cowgirl

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:45.410
holding a lasso.

01:10:45.475 --> 01:10:47.853
So every time
she'd twerk,

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:49.480
the lasso would just“.

01:10:49.579 --> 01:10:51.252
It would whip like that.
It would just do

01:10:51.314 --> 01:10:53.260
a little whip like that

01:10:53.316 --> 01:10:55.091
It was a pelvic thrust
that she would do.

01:10:55.184 --> 01:10:56.857
Anyways, we all
have a style.

01:10:56.919 --> 01:10:58.421
I have a style.
You all have a style.

01:10:58.654 --> 01:10:59.962
Breaking Bad,
you have a style.

01:11:00.056 --> 01:11:01.967
And if tiny Tim
can handle that,

01:11:02.058 --> 01:11:05.267
then more power to you,
and if he can't...

01:11:05.328 --> 01:11:07.069
Then, girl'
you need to call me.

01:11:07.597 --> 01:11:09.440
All right, okay.

01:11:20.777 --> 01:11:21.778
Ah!

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:25.120
This isn't a fair fight!

01:11:25.481 --> 01:11:26.824
How many of y'all
want some?

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:28.758
- Come on. Dump this shit.
- Switch!

01:11:33.222 --> 01:11:34.701
Okay, okay!

01:11:35.258 --> 01:11:36.999
Hold up!
He got my ribs!

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:38.127
My balls.

01:11:38.227 --> 01:11:39.228
Get off of him now!

01:11:42.765 --> 01:11:44.176
TINA; Put him down!

01:11:46.903 --> 01:11:47.973
Oh, you...

01:11:48.104 --> 01:11:50.516
Let me get mine! Let
me get on my feet.

01:11:52.375 --> 01:11:54.321
Y'all lucky I don't
call my cousins!

01:11:56.479 --> 01:11:58.015
You know you're
the only one I love.

01:12:01.017 --> 01:12:02.690
All right, come on.

01:12:02.785 --> 01:12:03.786
What was that?

01:12:03.853 --> 01:12:05.924
What? I got caught in
my pornographic memory mode.

01:12:05.988 --> 01:12:06.989
Worlds collide, okay?

01:12:07.089 --> 01:12:08.090
Hey' will you guys
knock it off?

01:12:08.157 --> 01:12:09.864
We got a life to save.
We gotta find the Senator.

01:12:21.103 --> 01:12:23.583
All assets are in place.
You are weapons free.

01:12:32.348 --> 01:12:34.521
Excuse me.
Remember me?

01:12:34.684 --> 01:12:35.685
<i>Mmm'?</i>

01:12:36.285 --> 01:12:37.286
Oh, shit.

01:12:37.653 --> 01:12:39.360
Relax.

01:12:39.722 --> 01:12:41.429
Everything's
going to be fine.

01:12:44.427 --> 01:12:46.236
Close your eyes.

01:13:03.679 --> 01:13:04.749
Almost there.

01:13:06.215 --> 01:13:07.694
<i>I have
eyes on him.</i>

01:13:15.258 --> 01:13:17.704
The Order has lowered
its standards, huh?

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:19.433
No more world
powers for clients.

01:13:19.528 --> 01:13:21.007
No more finger on
the pulse of history.

01:13:21.063 --> 01:13:23.407
Now you're just
another corporate tool.

01:13:23.466 --> 01:13:24.638
A cog in the wheel.

01:13:25.167 --> 01:13:27.010
Shut up, Mr Hester.

01:13:28.371 --> 01:13:29.372
Whoa.

01:13:29.705 --> 01:13:30.775
Jay?

01:13:31.474 --> 01:13:32.544
Jay?

01:13:33.609 --> 01:13:36.021
Hello'? Jay? Wake up, baby.
Come on.

01:13:36.545 --> 01:13:37.546
Wake up!

01:13:41.617 --> 01:13:43.392
Do you like Chekhov'?

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:46.100
You don't mean chief navigator
of the Enterprise,

01:13:46.188 --> 01:13:48.498
<i>so Cherry Orchard,
Uncle Vanya, Three Sisters...</i>

01:14:03.506 --> 01:14:04.644
A little
college Russian.

01:14:09.478 --> 01:14:11.219
Tatiana, kill him.

01:14:13.115 --> 01:14:14.924
I want you to know

01:14:21.223 --> 01:14:22.702
it's nothing personal.

01:14:23.059 --> 01:14:24.436
I think it is.

01:14:25.061 --> 01:14:26.938
Ah, for fuck's sake,
Tatiana.

01:14:31.701 --> 01:14:34.682
Stand down,
I repeat, stand down.

01:14:34.770 --> 01:14:36.408
Report back
for instructions.

01:14:57.426 --> 01:14:59.736
How dare you
interrupt our work!

01:15:06.168 --> 01:15:07.738
ls our deal off?

01:15:08.137 --> 01:15:10.447
No. Our deal is no
longer necessary.

01:15:14.477 --> 01:15:15.717
The Olsen twins
are waiting for you.

01:15:15.811 --> 01:15:17.518
Right? Right?

01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:18.650
<i>Sh“.</i>

01:15:18.714 --> 01:15:20.887
Listen, I'm going to
try to go get some help,

01:15:20.983 --> 01:15:23.156
'cause he needs to
go to the hospital.

01:15:23.219 --> 01:15:24.562
Keep that head up.
Hey, hey' hey!

01:15:24.653 --> 01:15:25.654
<i>Mmm.</i>

01:15:25.721 --> 01:15:27.758
Come here.
Come here.

01:15:32.828 --> 01:15:35.308
The Wolf wants
to see both of you.

01:15:36.465 --> 01:15:37.842
Now.

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:45.417
Dragno?

01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:52.218
And here
I thought all this

01:15:52.314 --> 01:15:55.386
daddy-issue, killer-cow
bullshit was just a sales ploy.

01:15:59.355 --> 01:16:01.232
Only because I can
see you're hurting.

01:16:02.091 --> 01:16:04.230
Tonight, our chief
Chinese competitor,

01:16:04.326 --> 01:16:06.067
having developed
their own exo-project

01:16:06.162 --> 01:16:07.766
in parallel with
the US military,

01:16:07.863 --> 01:16:09.433
agreed to a merger.

01:16:09.965 --> 01:16:12.912
We no longer need the US
government or their exo-armor.

01:16:12.968 --> 01:16:14.276
We have our own.

01:16:14.503 --> 01:16:17.040
It's so much more civilized
that way, don't you think?

01:16:18.574 --> 01:16:22.112
Our Chinese counterpart made the
merger conditional in dissolving

01:16:22.211 --> 01:16:24.350
all of our previous
entanglements.

01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:27.587
Which unfortunately
means all of you.

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:32.758
Dispose of them.

01:16:32.822 --> 01:16:34.096
If a black
market weapons dealer

01:16:34.190 --> 01:16:35.931
fucked the madam of a
cripples-only orphanage

01:16:35.991 --> 01:16:37.732
while Gordon Gekko
came on their faces,

01:16:37.793 --> 01:16:39.431
the thing they'd make
would be you'

01:16:39.528 --> 01:16:40.529
The Wolf.

01:16:48.204 --> 01:16:49.740
You flatter me.

01:16:58.848 --> 01:17:01.385
This time make sure the
bodies are never found.

01:17:11.393 --> 01:17:13.339
Your handler got
what he deserves.

01:17:13.429 --> 01:17:14.430
So will you.

01:17:14.797 --> 01:17:16.470
My handler?

01:17:17.032 --> 01:17:19.137
He was the only father
I've ever known.

01:17:19.568 --> 01:17:20.638
I lost my family.

01:17:20.703 --> 01:17:22.307
No one fucking cares.

01:17:22.972 --> 01:17:26.010
And no more talking. We're
almost to the drop zone.

01:17:26.876 --> 01:17:28.150
There's no reason
to go on.

01:17:28.244 --> 01:17:29.518
Yeah?

01:17:29.678 --> 01:17:31.680
There's always stripping, if
you need a reason to live.

01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:33.191
Jules' you okay, man?
Yeah.

01:17:33.282 --> 01:17:34.989
Non-lethal dose
of Propofol.

01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:37.030
But he's going to wish
he didn't wake up.

01:17:37.119 --> 01:17:39.463
You need a reason to go
on, now about vengeance?

01:17:39.588 --> 01:17:41.124
We'll help you.

01:17:43.592 --> 01:17:44.627
Hey, man.

01:17:44.693 --> 01:17:46.263
So the bodies
don't float.

01:18:06.815 --> 01:18:08.351
Hey, what's going
on back there' guys?

01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:10.487
Hey, man, I don't
approve of all of that.

01:18:24.633 --> 01:18:26.112
What was it, the stripping
or the vengeance?

01:18:26.202 --> 01:18:27.772
All right,
I need a little help.

01:18:29.939 --> 01:18:31.179
Need a little
help, guys!

01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:32.480
Tony, get him out!

01:18:39.682 --> 01:18:40.717
You know what
you're doing?

01:18:40.783 --> 01:18:42.319
I learned
in the army.

01:18:47.389 --> 01:18:49.232
Tank's been shot.
We're losing fuel fast.

01:18:49.325 --> 01:18:51.202
We'll have just enough
to reach our destination.

01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:52.500
What's that?

01:18:52.928 --> 01:18:54.134
Vengeance.

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:55.868
We're going to
the Wolf's den.

01:18:55.965 --> 01:18:58.377
The Wolf's Den?
Is that a strip club?

01:19:20.155 --> 01:19:22.135
We have
severed all ties.

01:19:22.791 --> 01:19:24.566
So it's a dean start.

01:19:26.929 --> 01:19:28.306
<i>We're very happy</i>

01:19:28.397 --> 01:19:31.173
<i>And now, Ms. Wollcroft,
3 present to you,</i>

01:19:31.533 --> 01:19:34.537
proof of concept and a
token of our friendship.

01:20:06.869 --> 01:20:08.314
They're not
slowing down.

01:20:09.104 --> 01:20:11.277
- Take care of it.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:20:22.451 --> 01:20:24.226
All right, what's the plan?
What's the plan?

01:20:24.586 --> 01:20:26.224
You jump.
I'll crash land.

01:20:26.622 --> 01:20:28.431
Crash? You ain't got
a better plan than that?

01:20:30.192 --> 01:20:31.296
There's got to
be a better plan.

01:20:32.661 --> 01:20:34.004
If things had
been different“.

01:20:34.063 --> 01:20:35.337
I know, it would've
been great.

01:20:36.799 --> 01:20:38.210
Come on, man,
we got to go.

01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:40.075
We're jumping, man.
Go, go. Jump.

01:20:40.169 --> 01:20:41.239
I'm scared of heights.

01:20:49.778 --> 01:20:52.224
O-M-G!

01:21:11.367 --> 01:21:12.675
Whoo! Whoo!

01:21:13.802 --> 01:21:15.543
Come on, man.
Go, go!

01:21:15.838 --> 01:21:17.818
Go! Move! Move! Go!

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:19.378
I don't wanna die!

01:21:22.211 --> 01:21:25.055
Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:21:29.084 --> 01:21:30.893
Come on!
Come on!

01:21:30.953 --> 01:21:32.489
Come on! Come on!
Come on, man!

01:21:32.554 --> 01:21:33.965
Oh, God!

01:21:37.126 --> 01:21:38.230
Fuck!

01:21:38.293 --> 01:21:40.295
Get down, man!
Get down!

01:21:40.429 --> 01:21:42.238
We got to move.

01:21:42.765 --> 01:21:45.143
Stay down!
Stay the fuck down!

01:21:47.436 --> 01:21:48.506
Oh, my God!

01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:05.621
What happened?

01:22:08.123 --> 01:22:09.864
What happened?
You see something?

01:22:09.992 --> 01:22:11.471
ANTHONY; Shit.

01:22:11.894 --> 01:22:13.703
They're dead.

01:22:36.552 --> 01:22:38.031
Stop right there!

01:22:49.665 --> 01:22:52.271
You're enhanced,
I'm enhanced.

01:22:52.334 --> 01:22:54.905
So why don't we just fight this
out like civilized people?

01:23:34.710 --> 01:23:36.849
<i>You have a lifetime of training
on me, I'll give you that.</i>

01:23:37.012 --> 01:23:39.515
But I have the best combat
software money can buy.

01:24:02.638 --> 01:24:03.981
<i>What is it
you always say?</i>

01:24:05.807 --> 01:24:07.115
It's nothing personal.

01:24:14.650 --> 01:24:17.256
This time
it is, bitch.

01:24:26.762 --> 01:24:28.833
(SIRENS WAILING}

01:24:36.004 --> 01:24:37.108
Hey!

01:24:37.205 --> 01:24:38.240
Drop your weapons!

01:24:38.307 --> 01:24:39.786
We're
private detectives!

01:24:39.908 --> 01:24:41.717
- Hands where we can see 'em!
- We're on the same team!

01:24:41.777 --> 01:24:44.155
Wait! Stop! They're the good guys.
They're with me.

Hey!
Oh, my God!

Come on, guys, sweep the house.
Come on in.

01:24:47.783 --> 01:24:49.558
Sweep the house.

01:24:51.053 --> 01:24:52.464
Go on and sweep
the house, bro.

01:24:52.554 --> 01:24:53.931
There's some
bad guys in there.

01:24:54.022 --> 01:24:55.592
It was crazy.
I had to slide.

01:24:55.691 --> 01:24:57.864
I picked up a gun.
I started shooting back“.

01:24:58.026 --> 01:24:59.061
Thank you for
your cooperation.

01:24:59.127 --> 01:25:01.038
- Thank you.
- Are you okay?

01:25:01.096 --> 01:25:02.598
<i>New W!'</i>

01:25:02.698 --> 01:25:04.609
Just want you to know,
I blamed it all on you.

01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:07.112
Good, 'cause
I blamed it on you' too.

01:25:07.169 --> 01:25:08.341
<i>Dam!</i>

01:25:09.871 --> 01:25:11.714
They found
Dr. Gussain this morning.

01:25:11.773 --> 01:25:12.774
Yeah?
SIMON E; Alive.

01:25:12.874 --> 01:25:14.114
<i>Mmm.</i>

01:25:14.176 --> 01:25:16.747
Get him down! Get him down!
Watch it!

01:25:17.479 --> 01:25:18.651
Let's get him
out of here.

01:25:18.747 --> 01:25:20.784
Oh, and they arrested
Beau LaMonde.

01:25:20.916 --> 01:25:22.918
Oh, see?
It's good.

01:25:24.920 --> 01:25:26.627
Show me
your hands, now!

01:25:26.722 --> 01:25:29.202
Guess there's
nothing left to do but

01:25:29.291 --> 01:25:30.827
go get on a plane
back to New York, huh'?

01:25:30.926 --> 01:25:33.668
No, we're not going nowhere, you still
got a competition to win. Let's go.

01:25:33.996 --> 01:25:35.998
All right, Anthony.

01:25:37.065 --> 01:25:39.102
Take care of yourself. You, too.

01:25:39.201 --> 01:25:41.147
Take care. Hey.

01:25:41.203 --> 01:25:44.480
You cleared Wilson's name and you
caught some really bad folks.

01:25:44.539 --> 01:25:46.678
You done us proud.
Thanks, Big Ray.

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:48.549
Maybe I can visit more often.
Oh, hell no.

01:25:48.777 --> 01:25:51.087
But listen, you are gonna kick out
for the bodywork on that Caddy,

01:25:51.179 --> 01:25:52.817
Mr. Big Fancy Pl.

01:25:53.382 --> 01:25:56.329
And you tell Antoine I
said, "Riff that shit up."

01:25:57.319 --> 01:25:58.957
Big Ray, man“.

01:25:59.187 --> 01:26:00.564
It's you, man.
You the man.

01:26:00.622 --> 01:26:02.568
Nice sweater.

01:26:03.358 --> 01:26:04.632
You know what,
fuck you.

01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:07.101
And the action
is fast and furious here

01:26:07.162 --> 01:26:09.574
as our chefs are preparing
their catfish courtbouillon.

01:26:09.998 --> 01:26:12.308
It's gonna be some
seriously good food here.

01:26:12.367 --> 01:26:13.675
It's already
smelling wonderful,

01:26:13.769 --> 01:26:15.146
and we haven't even
lit the fire yet.

01:26:15.203 --> 01:26:17.683
We'll be back here on
Bayou to Bourbon Street

01:26:17.773 --> 01:26:19.116
right after this.

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:24.490
Can we get some
stage hands up here

01:26:24.546 --> 01:26:25.718
and push this table
out of the way?

01:26:25.814 --> 01:26:26.849
Sorry, coming through.
Excuse us.

01:26:26.948 --> 01:26:28.359
Anthony, where you been?
You're a little late.

01:26:28.417 --> 01:26:29.987
Is this our chef?
Hey, how y'all doing?

01:26:30.052 --> 01:26:31.497
Hi, Anthony Hester.
Sorry about that.

01:26:31.553 --> 01:26:33.533
Hi, Chef Tardy,
how are you'?

01:26:33.588 --> 01:26:36.194
Who's this? Are Batman
and Robin gonna cook?

01:26:36.324 --> 01:26:38.201
No, I'm just his manager.
Manager?

01:26:38.427 --> 01:26:41.340
You could've managed to get
him here quicker, you think?

01:26:41.396 --> 01:26:42.966
I love this guy, right?

01:26:44.132 --> 01:26:45.133
You got this.

01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:46.679
Shit, man, I
haven't had any prep time.

01:26:46.735 --> 01:26:47.873
What? What are you
talking about?

01:26:47.969 --> 01:26:51.041
Remember what Big Ray said, "Let
it flow, just let it flow."

01:26:51.139 --> 01:26:52.584
Back in five, people.

01:26:52.674 --> 01:26:54.017
All right, let it flow.
Flow on out of here.

01:26:54.076 --> 01:26:56.556
Four, three, two“.
Off the stage.

01:26:56.611 --> 01:26:57.612
Calm down,
Chef Boyardee.

01:26:57.746 --> 01:27:00.920
And we're back here on
Bayou 10 Bourbon Street,

01:27:01.016 --> 01:27:02.825
and the action is
fast and furious.

01:27:02.884 --> 01:27:06.457
I'm Guy Mancini, and you can
see our chefs are really

01:27:06.822 --> 01:27:08.267
flying into ii.

01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:10.594
Yeah, and what do
we see over here?

01:27:10.726 --> 01:27:13.639
Jamie is Knocking out“. It looks
like Jamie is making a mirepoix.

01:27:14.162 --> 01:27:16.267
Yeah, all of our chefs are really...
Jay, what's he doing?

01:27:16.998 --> 01:27:18.375
...really
getting involved.

01:27:18.433 --> 01:27:21.277
Oh, he's focusing his energy.
He'll be all right.

01:27:21.369 --> 01:27:24.543
Tearing it up over here as they
prepare their catfish courtbouillon.

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:26.014
He looks paralyzed.

01:27:26.074 --> 01:27:27.553
No, no, no. He knows
what he's doing.

01:27:27.776 --> 01:27:29.585
<i>RAY". You got to give
yourself over to it.</i>

01:27:29.644 --> 01:27:31.851
<i>Just riff, brother.
Just riff.</i>

01:27:35.751 --> 01:27:36.957
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Do that.

01:27:37.319 --> 01:27:39.026
We've got a lot
of action going on.

01:27:39.221 --> 01:27:40.291
Let's see what he
does with his fish,

01:27:40.388 --> 01:27:42.732
'cause everybody else
is so far ahead of him.

01:27:42.891 --> 01:27:44.495
Come on, Anthony.

01:27:44.726 --> 01:27:45.864
Looking
good, Anthony.

01:27:45.927 --> 01:27:47.099
I know
you can't really rush art,

01:27:47.195 --> 01:27:49.732
but we are gonna rush our catfish
courtbouillons over here.

01:27:49.798 --> 01:27:50.776
Oh, there it is.

01:27:50.866 --> 01:27:52.743
- Looking at him.
- Scoring his fish.

01:27:54.136 --> 01:27:55.581
Oh, Jesus,
it's a fire!

01:27:55.670 --> 01:27:58.082
Anybody ever seen anything like this before?

01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:00.581
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're looking at a winner.

01:28:00.675 --> 01:28:02.154
Wow, it's smelling
really good, too.

01:28:02.244 --> 01:28:03.348
You're the best!

01:28:04.246 --> 01:28:05.350
Around.

01:28:05.747 --> 01:28:10.059
And next up is Chef
Anthony Hester's new creation

01:28:10.118 --> 01:28:12.325
of, uh, catfish amandine.

01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:13.831
We'll start
with you, Carol.

01:28:14.122 --> 01:28:15.692
I see some...

01:28:17.092 --> 01:28:18.594
This dish is superb.

01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:20.333
...real soul
in here.

01:28:20.428 --> 01:28:22.806
I can taste the
passion in this dish.

01:28:22.898 --> 01:28:25.708
This dish is
very complex,

01:28:25.801 --> 01:28:27.371
to the point of
being dangerous.

01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:33.486
<i>ANNOUNCER". Crotch crickets
ruining your love life?</i>

01:28:33.542 --> 01:28:36.921
<i>Annoying chirping sounds from your
nether regions keeping you up ail night?</i>

01:28:36.978 --> 01:28:39.686
<i>Try Crick-a-cil, the number-one
crotch crickets-be-gone cream</i>

01:28:39.781 --> 01:28:41.089
<i>and take back
your night.</i>

01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:42.389
<i>Side effects may include
dry mouth, fever,</i>

01:28:42.484 --> 01:28:43.929
<i>rabbit ears, ﬂatulence,
loose bowels, dandruff,</i>

01:28:43.985 --> 01:28:45.726
<i>snot bubbles, and premature balding.
Consult your doctor.</i>

01:28:46.688 --> 01:28:49.134
And our judges
have conferred.

01:28:49.191 --> 01:28:50.864
And after tasting all
of our entries today,

01:28:50.959 --> 01:28:52.563
they have come
to a conclusion.

01:28:52.727 --> 01:28:55.333
And the winner of today's
Bayou to Bourbon Street Festival

01:28:55.397 --> 01:28:58.173
is none other than“.

01:29:08.109 --> 01:29:10.988
Alligator cheesecake? Mmm-hmm.
We can do that.

01:29:11.046 --> 01:29:12.286
Okay?-

01:29:12.347 --> 01:29:14.327
Yeah, and if you see Big
Ray, tell him I said hi.

01:29:14.749 --> 01:29:15.853
- Okay, I love you.
<i>- I love</i> you.

01:29:15.951 --> 01:29:18.022
How's Simone?
Hey. She's good.

01:29:18.119 --> 01:29:20.827
I told her maybe I'll fly
down for Mardi Gras. Ah!

01:29:21.957 --> 01:29:23.595
<i>Anthony Hester.</i>

01:29:26.595 --> 01:29:28.597
<i>I understand that you have</i>
a <i>restaurant up in New York.</i>

01:29:28.730 --> 01:29:30.767
<i>Yes. What's the name of it?
Give it a plug.</i>

01:29:31.032 --> 01:29:32.773
<i>Uh... Uh...</i>

01:29:33.201 --> 01:29:34.737
<i>GUY". Name. Name
of the restaurant.</i>

01:29:34.769 --> 01:29:36.510
It's... Hey,
man, I like the new name.

01:29:36.605 --> 01:29:37.982
<i>I'm kind of in between names.
Thanks, Jules.</i>

01:29:43.211 --> 01:29:45.418
Okay, here we go
right here.

01:29:45.513 --> 01:29:46.924
Your marinated kale.

01:29:47.048 --> 01:29:48.857
And that is
your fresh salad.

01:29:56.725 --> 01:29:59.934
All right, it's good. Come, come.
Go, go, go, Table 3.

01:30:56.851 --> 01:30:58.057
Mr. Hester.

01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:00.163
I have no weapons.

01:31:14.869 --> 01:31:16.246
Your whole body
is a weapon.

01:31:20.875 --> 01:31:22.548
What other parts
of you are enhanced?

01:31:23.545 --> 01:31:25.354
Want me
to show you?
