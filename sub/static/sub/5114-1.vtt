00:45.087 --> 00:48.089
Here in Malaysia, there is an almost
overwhelming sense of euphoria,

00:48.173 --> 00:50.133
as the newly-elected
prime minister

00:50.217 --> 00:52.885
has given this impoverished
nation the gift of hope,

00:52.970 --> 00:55.596
promising to raise the
substandard minimum wage

00:55.681 --> 00:57.724
and end child labour
once and for all.

00:57.808 --> 00:59.851
Already considered a living saint,

00:59.935 --> 01:02.353
he has become this small
country's greatest hope,

01:02.438 --> 01:04.313
for a thriving future
in the new millennium.

01:07.943 --> 01:09.193
Get closer, Jaco.

01:09.695 --> 01:12.905
This is disgusting. How
could you let this happen?

01:13.699 --> 01:16.909
I have negotiated my
butt off, Giorgio.

01:16.994 --> 01:20.747
I've tried bribes, I've tried gifts.
I even sent him some pet oxen.

01:20.831 --> 01:25.376
I mean, they love that crap in
Malaysia, but he won't budge.

01:25.461 --> 01:27.503
Listen, 50% of my inventory

01:27.588 --> 01:30.423
is manufactured in sweatshops
on the Malaysian border.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.258
Something has got to be done.

01:32.801 --> 01:34.886
If Malaysia goes, what is next?

01:34.970 --> 01:37.930
My entire panty line
is made in Vietnam.

01:38.015 --> 01:39.807
We'll all go bankrupt
within a year.

01:40.225 --> 01:43.019
The Malaysian must be
eliminated, Mugatu.

01:44.188 --> 01:47.523
What? No, I don't
have time for this.

01:47.858 --> 01:48.941
Perhaps you'd rather go back

01:49.026 --> 01:51.736
to turning out novelty
neckties in Hackensack.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.071
But my new fall
line is almost due.

01:54.490 --> 01:57.575
And I trust you would like to live
to see your spring line, as well?

01:58.952 --> 02:02.205
The Malaysian prime minister
visits New York in 14 days.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.290
Do it then.

02:04.374 --> 02:07.835
Fourteen days? That's Fashion Week.
It's impossible! I have a show!

02:07.920 --> 02:10.963
It's perfect. Invite him to
be your guest of honour.

02:11.048 --> 02:14.008
That's not enough time. It takes
months to train an operative.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.469
What about Fabio?

02:17.513 --> 02:22.391
Too smart. This is a rush job. He's
got to be extremely dim-witted.

02:22.726 --> 02:26.479
- You know the profile, Jacobim.
- A beautiful, self-absorbed,

02:26.563 --> 02:29.857
simpleton who can be manipulated
and moulded like Jell-O.

02:30.317 --> 02:31.776
Or cookie dough.

02:32.069 --> 02:34.362
- Or Play-Doh.
- Any kind of dough.

02:34.863 --> 02:41.244
The point is, we need an empty vessel,
a shallow, dumb, vacuous moron.

02:41.620 --> 02:43.996
And when he's finished,
we'll dispose of him.

02:44.289 --> 02:45.498
But who?

02:45.791 --> 02:47.834
I mean, where in all of
God's green goodness,

02:47.918 --> 02:51.337
am I gonna find someone
that beef-headed?

02:53.715 --> 02:56.843
Derek, I just have a few more
questions, if that's okay.

02:56.927 --> 02:58.010
Cool.

02:58.095 --> 03:00.596
So when did you know you
wanted to be a model?

03:01.223 --> 03:04.725
I guess it would have to be the first
time I went through the second grade.

03:04.810 --> 03:08.104
I caught my reflection in a spoon
while I was eating my cereal,

03:08.188 --> 03:11.274
and I remember thinking, "Wow,
you're ridiculously good-looking."

03:11.692 --> 03:14.610
- "Maybe you could do that
for a career." - Do what?

03:14.862 --> 03:17.613
- Be professionally good-looking.
- Right.

03:18.073 --> 03:20.408
What would you say your
trademark is, if you have one?

03:20.492 --> 03:23.828
Well, I guess the look I'm
best known for is Blue Steel.

03:23.912 --> 03:25.371
What's that look like?

03:28.959 --> 03:30.126
That's impressive.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.921
And then there's
Ferrari and Le Tigre.

03:34.006 --> 03:37.258
Le Tigre's a lot softer. It's a
bit more of a catalogue look.

03:37.342 --> 03:40.344
- I use it for footwear sometimes.
- Can I see that?

03:51.857 --> 03:53.649
Look, without Derek Zoolander,

03:53.734 --> 03:56.027
male modelling wouldn't
be what it is today.

03:56.111 --> 03:57.737
He is a fashion icon.

03:57.821 --> 04:00.156
So, do you spend a lot of
time working on these looks,

04:00.240 --> 04:01.616
thinking about them?

04:01.700 --> 04:05.995
Sure. I've been working on Magnum
for at least eight or nine years.

04:06.079 --> 04:09.081
"Magnum"? That's intriguing.
Can I see that?

04:09.458 --> 04:12.418
Are you kidding? I shouldn't
even be talking about it.

04:12.836 --> 04:14.086
It's nowhere near ready.

04:14.838 --> 04:19.257
It's almost like there's a light
around him. He exudes beauty.

04:19.343 --> 04:21.385
I think about Derek every
time I design a collection.

04:21.470 --> 04:23.387
Derek, I don't know
if you're familiar

04:23.472 --> 04:25.556
with the belief that some
aboriginal tribes hold.

04:25.641 --> 04:29.602
It's the concept that a photo
might steal a part of your soul.

04:29.686 --> 04:30.811
What are your thoughts on that,

04:30.896 --> 04:33.564
as someone who gets his
picture taken for a living?

04:33.649 --> 04:38.194
That Blue Steel look he does? Oh,
my gosh! The style and the hair.

04:38.946 --> 04:42.615
You know, it's almost like the new afro
for the white man, but it's beautiful.

04:42.699 --> 04:46.035
Well, I guess I would have to answer
your question with another question.

04:47.204 --> 04:49.956
How many "abo-digitals"
do you see modelling?

04:51.208 --> 04:53.793
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the
fashion industry's biggest night,

04:53.877 --> 04:55.044
the VH 1 Fashion Awards.

05:00.008 --> 05:02.468
There he is, three-time
Male Model of the Year,

05:02.552 --> 05:04.220
Derek Zoolander.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.638
He's like music.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.098
Proud owner of Blue Steel,

05:07.182 --> 05:09.308
the look that made him
the legend he now is.

05:09.393 --> 05:11.352
He's almost too good-looking.

05:11.436 --> 05:12.603
Hey, Paco!

05:12.729 --> 05:18.401
That would be my main deterrent
in considering a relationship.

05:27.786 --> 05:30.913
And that's who Derek Zoolander is
defending his title against tonight.

05:32.082 --> 05:33.791
Hansel.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.252
- Hansel, right here!
- All right, all right.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.754
The rookie sensation
who has burned his way

05:38.839 --> 05:40.923
into the eye sockets
of the fashion world,

05:41.049 --> 05:43.259
and left them clawing
their faces for more.

05:44.011 --> 05:47.179
Mugatu sucks! Support
the prime minister!

05:47.264 --> 05:50.433
Mugatu uses slave labour!

05:51.768 --> 05:53.936
Down with Mugatu!

05:54.021 --> 05:57.106
You hate to see something like
that at an event like this.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.984
Ugly protesters bothering
beautiful people.

06:00.068 --> 06:03.779
There's no denying Jacobim Mugatu
has used cheap Malaysian workers

06:03.864 --> 06:07.199
to make his, and most of the
garment industry's, clothes.

06:07.701 --> 06:10.494
- Derek! Derek!
- Hey, Steve, how are you doing?

06:10.579 --> 06:13.873
You're going for your fourth straight
Male Model of the Year award tonight.

06:13.957 --> 06:15.416
Come on. Are you nervous?

06:15.500 --> 06:17.543
Well, there are couple of little
butterflies in my basket,

06:17.627 --> 06:19.128
but I think I'm doing okay.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.464
We also hear you're working on a new
look. Can you tell us about it?

06:22.090 --> 06:24.967
Actually, I can't, Steve,
because it's not yet perfected.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.011
But I can tell you that
it's called Magnum and...

06:27.095 --> 06:28.637
Shut, baby, shut!

06:28.722 --> 06:30.848
If I tell you anything else,
this guy's gonna kill me.

06:30.932 --> 06:32.558
Got that right. How are
you doing, Steven?

06:32.642 --> 06:35.895
- Maury Ballstein, Balls Models.
- A man who needs no introduction.

06:35.979 --> 06:39.398
Maury, you've handled every important
male model for the last 30 years.

06:39.483 --> 06:41.734
- Derek's chances tonight?
- Let me tell you something.

06:41.818 --> 06:44.862
Nobody can touch Derek. Nobody!
I gotta get inside.

06:44.946 --> 06:47.990
I'm shvitzing like a shmendrick
with all these lights.

06:56.333 --> 06:59.376
Derek! Derek! Are you
worried about Hansel?

07:00.670 --> 07:03.047
Not as much as I'm
worried about Gretel.

07:03.465 --> 07:06.217
Hey, put that Hansel and
Gretel line in your article.

07:06.301 --> 07:08.010
I want people to know
how funny I can be.

07:08.095 --> 07:10.805
Oh, believe me, they'll know.
It hits newsstands tomorrow.

07:10.889 --> 07:13.933
Excuse me, Mr Mugatu. Mr
Mugatu, Matilda Jeffries.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.226
Time magazine.

07:15.310 --> 07:17.603
Any comment on Prime Minister
Hassan's wage increases

07:17.687 --> 07:19.980
- for Malaysian garment workers?
- No, he has no comment.

07:20.065 --> 07:21.440
Why don't you let him
speak for himself?

07:21.525 --> 07:24.110
Isn't it true you'd like to see
the prime minister out of power

07:24.194 --> 07:26.237
so you can continue exploiting
cheap Malaysian workers?

07:26.321 --> 07:30.074
Hey, Mugatu! Screw you and
your little dog, too!

07:30.158 --> 07:32.368
Look out! She's got an egg!

07:32.452 --> 07:34.578
Oh, my God! Let go of me!

07:34.663 --> 07:36.080
Yes!

07:37.207 --> 07:38.207
Yes.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.042
Wow.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.295
I just can't tell you how
much this means to me,

07:43.380 --> 07:45.881
to be the first recipient
of this beautiful award.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.717
We have a serious problem
on our hands, Maury.

07:49.010 --> 07:51.554
This Malaysian thing is
getting out of hand.

07:51.638 --> 07:52.972
I hear you, Jaco.

07:53.056 --> 07:55.933
What this, the Slashie, mean,

07:56.017 --> 07:59.520
is you consider me the
best actor slash model,

08:00.355 --> 08:02.064
and not the other way around.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.652
His proposed wage increase
could ruin all of us.

08:06.736 --> 08:09.572
I need it taken care of soon.
I have people to answer to.

08:11.533 --> 08:12.992
All right, now to the
important stuff.

08:13.076 --> 08:15.536
These ain't no slashes, folks.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.288
These are the pure breeds.

08:17.747 --> 08:21.000
Here are the nominees for
Male Model of the Year.

08:21.751 --> 08:24.003
Young, hot, brash.

08:24.087 --> 08:27.882
With more covers in his first
year than any rookie model ever

08:27.966 --> 08:31.510
and an attitude that says, "Who cares?
It's only fashion."

08:31.595 --> 08:34.221
That Hansel's so hot right now.

08:35.097 --> 08:38.308
I hear a lot of words like
"beauty" and "handsomeness"

08:38.393 --> 08:40.019
and "incredibly
chiselled features."

08:40.102 --> 08:42.980
To me, that's like a
vanity, a self-absorption,

08:43.063 --> 08:45.232
that I try to steer clear of.

08:45.317 --> 08:48.360
I dig the bungee. For me, it's
just the way I live my life.

08:48.445 --> 08:51.030
I grip it and I rip it. I
live it with a lot of flair.

08:51.114 --> 08:53.908
I live it on the edge,
where I gotta be.

08:53.992 --> 08:58.329
I wasn't like every other kid, who
dreams about being an astronaut.

08:58.455 --> 09:03.250
I was always more interested in what
bark was made out of on a tree.

09:04.628 --> 09:07.046
Richard Gere's a real hero of mine.
Sting.

09:07.130 --> 09:08.881
Sting would be another
person who's a hero.

09:08.965 --> 09:10.674
The music that he's
created over the years,

09:10.759 --> 09:12.218
I don't really listen to it,

09:12.302 --> 09:14.678
but the fact that he's
making it, I respect that.

09:15.513 --> 09:17.223
I care desperatety
about what I do.

09:17.307 --> 09:21.268
Do I know what product I'm selling? No.
Do I know what I'm doing today? No.

09:21.353 --> 09:24.813
But I'm here, and I'm gonna
give it my best shot.

09:32.447 --> 09:34.365
Over the past decade,

09:34.491 --> 09:37.952
male modelling has had a
shadow cast over it by one man

09:38.036 --> 09:39.620
and five syllables,

09:39.704 --> 09:42.206
Derek Zoolander.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.669
Modelling, to me, isn't just
about being good-looking,

09:46.753 --> 09:50.339
or having a lot of fun and being
really, really good-looking.

09:56.346 --> 09:57.846
The calendar was great,

09:57.931 --> 10:00.683
because it gave people a chance
to see a side of my versatility.

10:00.767 --> 10:04.937
The original Greek word for model
means "misshapen ball of clay",

10:05.021 --> 10:07.398
and I try to think about that every
time I get in front of a camera.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.942
Three-time Male Model of the Year.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.371
And the award goes to

10:27.544 --> 10:28.044
Hansel.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.770
Thank you, Lenny.

10:49.232 --> 10:50.316
Wow!

10:51.776 --> 10:54.903
You know, a lot of people
said winning this award

10:55.113 --> 10:57.072
four years in a row
couldn't happen.

10:58.074 --> 10:59.658
Well, I guess I showed...

11:15.633 --> 11:18.594
I think we've found our
solution, Ballstein.

11:19.471 --> 11:21.680
No, not Derek.

11:21.806 --> 11:24.433
He's perfect, and you know it.
Now make it happen.

11:26.436 --> 11:29.355
It stings me like a fissure
in my ass, but you're right.

11:29.439 --> 11:30.856
He's ready.

11:51.961 --> 11:53.128
Who am I?

11:54.297 --> 11:55.464
I don't know.

11:56.841 --> 11:59.134
I guess I have a lot
of things to ponder.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.263
Hey, the results are in, amigo!

12:03.473 --> 12:05.307
What's left to ponder?

12:08.103 --> 12:09.895
Nice comeback!

13:24.512 --> 13:25.804
I can't stand Hansel!

13:25.889 --> 13:27.181
I know, right?

13:27.265 --> 13:29.558
Riding in on that scooter
like he's so cool.

13:29.726 --> 13:32.936
- And the way Hansel combs his hair.
- Or, like, doesn't.

13:33.104 --> 13:37.357
It's like, "'Ex-squeeze' me, but
have you ever heard of styling gel?"

13:37.692 --> 13:40.402
I'm sure Hansel's heard of styling gel.
He's a male model.

13:40.737 --> 13:42.654
Earth to Brint. I
was making a joke.

13:42.780 --> 13:45.908
Earth to Meekus. Duh, okay?
I knew that.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.285
Earth to Brint. I'm
not so sure you did

13:48.369 --> 13:51.288
'cause you were all, "Well, I'm
sure he's heard of styling gel."

13:51.372 --> 13:53.415
Like you didn't
know it was a joke.

13:54.751 --> 13:57.294
I knew it was a joke, Meekus. I
just didn't get it right away.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.922
- Earth to Brint...
- Would you guys stop it already!

14:01.424 --> 14:03.675
Did you ever think that
maybe there's more to life

14:03.760 --> 14:08.555
than being really, really, really,
ridiculously good-looking?

14:10.600 --> 14:12.100
I mean, maybe we should be doing

14:12.185 --> 14:14.228
something more meaningful
with our lives.

14:15.271 --> 14:16.647
Like helping people.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.650
Derek, what people?

14:20.985 --> 14:23.862
I don't know. People
who need help.

14:24.822 --> 14:28.534
Models help people. They make
them feel good about themselves.

14:28.618 --> 14:32.287
They also show them how to dress cool,
and wear their hair in interesting ways.

14:33.081 --> 14:34.456
I guess so.

14:34.791 --> 14:37.960
You know what could really help you
sort through these important issues?

14:38.086 --> 14:39.127
What?

14:39.963 --> 14:42.714
- Orange mocha frappuccino!
- Orange mocha frappuccino!

14:44.384 --> 14:45.759
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

14:46.052 --> 14:48.303
Come on, man! Come on!

15:57.540 --> 16:01.043
"Derek Zoolander. A model idiot."

16:20.063 --> 16:21.521
- Brint!
- Huh?

16:21.606 --> 16:22.731
No!

16:35.411 --> 16:39.247
Rufus, Brint and Meekus
were like brothers to me.

16:39.916 --> 16:43.669
And when I say brother, I don't
mean like an actual brother,

16:43.753 --> 16:46.004
but I mean it like the
way black people use it,

16:47.507 --> 16:48.924
which is more meaningful, I think.

16:49.842 --> 16:53.261
If there's anything that this
horrible tragedy can teach us,

16:53.388 --> 16:57.182
it's that a male model's life is
a precious, precious commodity.

16:57.725 --> 17:02.688
Just because we have chiselled
abs, and stunning features,

17:03.648 --> 17:08.402
it doesn't mean that we too can't not
die in a freak gasoline fight accident.

17:09.820 --> 17:13.365
So today, ladies and gentlemen, I
would like to take this opportunity,

17:13.449 --> 17:16.326
to announce my...

17:24.210 --> 17:27.253
Hansel. He's so hot right now.
Hansel.

17:28.131 --> 17:29.923
I would like to take this...

17:31.634 --> 17:33.427
People!

17:34.303 --> 17:37.431
I'd like to announce my retirement
from the male modelling profession.

17:39.016 --> 17:40.183
What?

17:41.144 --> 17:45.480
I'm pretty sure there's a lot more to life
than being really, really good-looking.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.400
And I plan on finding out what that is.
Thank you.

17:48.484 --> 17:50.819
Mr Mugatu! Mr Mugatu!

17:50.903 --> 17:53.113
If I could just have a moment
of your time, please, sir.

17:53.197 --> 17:55.699
Just one minute of your
time, please, sir!

17:57.577 --> 17:59.786
Derek? Derek, hey!

17:59.912 --> 18:03.081
- What do you want?
- Actually, I'm trying to talk to Mugatu,

18:03.166 --> 18:05.250
but he's tougher to get
to than the president.

18:05.334 --> 18:08.253
I thought you were gonna tell me
what a bad "eugoogolizer" I am.

18:08.337 --> 18:09.504
A what?

18:10.256 --> 18:12.924
A "eugoogolizer." One
who speaks at funerals.

18:15.136 --> 18:17.846
Or did you think I'd be too stupid
to know what a "eugoogoly" was?

18:19.807 --> 18:22.058
How could you have written those
terrible things about me?

18:22.143 --> 18:24.978
Look, Derek, my editor put
that headline on it, okay?

18:25.062 --> 18:27.856
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I know
it came off kind of harsh.

18:28.149 --> 18:30.442
Yeah, well, fortunately for
you, not too many people I know

18:30.526 --> 18:33.403
read your little Time magazine,
or whatever it's called.

18:33.488 --> 18:35.614
Look, maybe you could
do me a favour.

18:35.698 --> 18:38.992
All I'm trying to do is get some
background information on Mugatu.

18:39.076 --> 18:41.036
Mugatu? If you knew anything,

18:41.120 --> 18:43.997
you'd know Mugatu's the one
designer who's never hired me.

18:44.207 --> 18:45.373
Come on. There's gotta be...

18:45.458 --> 18:47.584
Sorry, lady. Not interested.

18:47.668 --> 18:50.796
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got
an after funeral party to attend.

18:55.092 --> 18:57.135
Go back home? You're overreacting.

18:57.220 --> 18:59.554
I want to do something
meaningful with my life, Maury.

18:59.847 --> 19:01.973
I have deeper thoughts on my mind.

19:02.058 --> 19:04.226
The other day, I was
thinking about volunteering,

19:04.310 --> 19:07.145
to help teach underprivileged
children to learn how to read.

19:07.230 --> 19:10.857
Just thinking about it was the most
rewarding experience I've ever had.

19:10.942 --> 19:12.943
Derek, I don't think you're cut
out for that kind of thing.

19:13.027 --> 19:15.445
I mean, maybe I could even
have my own institute.

19:15.530 --> 19:21.409
We could call it the Derek Zoolander
Centre for Kids Who Can't Read Good.

19:21.744 --> 19:23.954
What about us? We built
this place together.

19:24.038 --> 19:25.747
Look out! Tushy squeeze!

19:26.123 --> 19:27.123
Maury!

19:27.291 --> 19:29.376
Derek, when I met you,
you were a junior petite

19:29.460 --> 19:31.586
who couldn't book a
goddamn Sears catalogue,

19:31.671 --> 19:33.296
and who couldn't turn
left to save his ass.

19:33.381 --> 19:36.424
- Now look at you.
- I can turn left!

19:36.926 --> 19:38.134
Yeah, right.

19:38.261 --> 19:40.846
Derek, please. Some male models
go left at the end of a runway,

19:40.930 --> 19:42.055
others go right.

19:42.139 --> 19:45.225
You got a lot of gifts, but hanging
a louie just isn't one of them.

19:45.309 --> 19:46.601
Sit down!

19:48.271 --> 19:50.438
Hey, you want to hear
some great news?

19:54.777 --> 19:57.946
Mugatu wants you for
his new campaign.

19:58.114 --> 20:01.199
Didn't you hear me, Maury?
I just retired.

20:01.284 --> 20:03.243
But this is Mugatu, Derek.

20:03.619 --> 20:05.620
Right now, this guy is so hot,

20:05.746 --> 20:09.207
he can take a crap, wrap it in tin
foil, put a couple of fishhooks on it,

20:09.292 --> 20:11.751
and sell it to Queen
Elizabeth as earrings.

20:14.338 --> 20:18.133
Derek, you're the laughing stock
of the entire fashion world.

20:20.011 --> 20:23.805
What do we do when we
fall off the horse?

20:29.812 --> 20:31.771
We get back on.

20:33.316 --> 20:36.192
Sorry, Maury. I'm not a gymnast.

20:37.028 --> 20:40.447
I'm going back home. I need to
get in touch with my roots.

20:40.531 --> 20:43.450
Figure out who I am.
See you around, Maury.

21:15.608 --> 21:16.775
Hey, Pop!

21:22.990 --> 21:24.115
It's me.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.578
Scrappy, Luke,

21:30.331 --> 21:31.790
you remember your brother, right?

21:32.333 --> 21:33.500
What do you want?

21:34.877 --> 21:37.545
I thought maybe I could work
the mines with you guys.

21:37.713 --> 21:39.923
You know, all the Zoolander
men together again,

21:40.007 --> 21:41.591
like when we were kids.

21:42.176 --> 21:43.343
Times have changed, boy.

21:43.427 --> 21:45.720
You wouldn't last one day
down those coal pits.

21:46.472 --> 21:49.349
Can't you even pretend to
be happy to see me, Pop?

21:49.725 --> 21:53.728
Damn it, Derek, I'm a coal miner, not a
professional film and television actor.

21:55.189 --> 21:59.901
Do us all a favour
and get out of here.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.364
Pop, wait, please!

22:04.740 --> 22:06.074
Give me a chance.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.661
I won't let you down. I promise.

22:16.252 --> 22:22.173
Hold very still. Very still.
I'm working right now. This...

22:22.258 --> 22:24.050
- Ouch!
- Oh, I'm sorry.

22:24.135 --> 22:26.386
Did my pin get in the
way of your ass?

22:26.762 --> 22:29.556
Do me a favour and lose
five pounds immediately,

22:29.640 --> 22:31.766
or get out of my
building like now!

22:31.934 --> 22:33.268
Get out!

22:33.769 --> 22:36.521
I'm so tired! No, Todd, not now!

22:36.605 --> 22:37.856
It's Maury.

22:38.482 --> 22:39.774
Tell me something good.

22:39.942 --> 22:41.860
You may have to start
looking for someone else.

22:42.236 --> 22:45.780
There is no one else. The show
is in 10 days, Ballstein.

22:46.073 --> 22:48.199
Jaco, I hear you, but
the kid's mixed up.

22:48.284 --> 22:51.119
He went home. He's talking
about going off to ponder

22:51.203 --> 22:53.621
and tutoring underprivileged
retards or some shit.

22:53.706 --> 22:56.666
I don't care what it takes.
Get him back.

22:56.792 --> 22:59.044
We're running out of time.
Capisce?

22:59.128 --> 23:02.130
Yeah, I capisce. Now if
I could only ca-piss.

23:02.214 --> 23:05.759
My prostate's flaring up
like a frickin' tiki torch.

23:06.427 --> 23:10.472
Give me a little pee-pee.
Come on, a couple of drops.

23:12.308 --> 23:14.642
That's what I'm talking about!

23:48.511 --> 23:49.677
Surprise!

23:57.019 --> 23:58.645
What the hell's the
matter with you?

24:10.658 --> 24:12.534
Pacheco back to pass.

24:12.618 --> 24:14.369
He's feeling pressure
from Pressman.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.538
He's tooking for his All-American
John DeRosa, the wide receiver.

24:16.622 --> 24:18.373
He's got him wide open in
the middle of the field.

24:18.499 --> 24:20.041
Big rush.

24:20.167 --> 24:21.960
Who's winning the match?

24:22.044 --> 24:24.295
Hits Kevin Connolly, the
tight end down in there.

24:24.380 --> 24:25.713
State.

24:30.469 --> 24:33.138
I think I'm getting
the black lung, Pop.

24:33.222 --> 24:35.473
It's not very well
ventilated down there.

24:35.558 --> 24:37.976
For Christ's sake, Derek,
you've been down there one day.

24:38.060 --> 24:40.603
Talk to me in 30 years.

24:51.157 --> 24:54.159
Moisture is the
essence of wetness,

24:57.913 --> 25:02.750
and wetness is the
essence of beauty.

25:13.262 --> 25:16.598
Why'd you have to come
back to this damn town?

25:17.766 --> 25:20.143
I wanted to make a
new life for myself.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.646
I'm sorry I was born with
this perfect bone structure.

25:23.772 --> 25:26.274
That my hair looks better
done up with gel and mousse

25:26.400 --> 25:28.985
than hidden under a stupid
hat with a light on it!

25:30.112 --> 25:33.364
All I ever wanted to do was
make you proud of me, Pop.

25:33.908 --> 25:36.117
With what? Your male modelling?

25:36.785 --> 25:38.369
Prancing around in your underwear

25:38.454 --> 25:40.455
with your wiener hanging
out for everyone to see?

25:44.960 --> 25:46.127
You're dead to me, boy.

25:48.255 --> 25:51.674
You're more dead to me
than your dead mother.

25:53.469 --> 25:56.804
I just thank the Lord she didn't
live to see her son as a mermaid.

26:00.643 --> 26:01.935
Merman.

26:07.066 --> 26:08.316
Merman!

26:18.160 --> 26:19.911
Who am I?

26:31.382 --> 26:34.050
Hello? Derek, you hearing me?

26:34.426 --> 26:36.219
- God?
- God?

26:36.345 --> 26:39.264
What the shit are you talking about?
It's me. Maury.

26:39.348 --> 26:41.015
I hope you're finished
touching your roots,

26:41.100 --> 26:43.768
because Mugatu's making you
an offer you won't believe.

26:43.852 --> 26:45.603
You gotta get your
tuches back here.

26:50.776 --> 26:54.404
Well, to tell you the truth, I was a
little hesitant at first, Mr Mugatu.

26:54.697 --> 26:58.866
I mean, you've never hired me
before, and I've been around for...

26:58.951 --> 27:01.369
For ages and ages. You've been
around for a long, long time.

27:01.453 --> 27:02.662
I never wanted anything from you.

27:02.746 --> 27:04.914
And now that you're
retired, I can't have you.

27:04.999 --> 27:06.291
And it's funny how it
switches like that.

27:07.042 --> 27:09.460
But now the forbidden
fruit must be tasted.

27:10.004 --> 27:12.714
Well, when Maury told me what
you were willing to do, I...

27:16.385 --> 27:17.385
Todd!

27:17.928 --> 27:21.556
Are you not aware that I get farty
and bloated with a foamy latte?

27:21.974 --> 27:23.808
My mistake, Jacobim.

27:24.226 --> 27:25.393
Your mistake, indeed!

27:36.780 --> 27:37.864
Yes, Derek.

27:39.408 --> 27:42.076
What Maury said I was
willing to do for you.

27:42.411 --> 27:45.496
Let's get back to the reason
that we're really here.

27:48.250 --> 27:50.877
Without much further
ado, I give you

27:52.421 --> 27:55.882
the Derek Zoolander Centre for
Kids Who Can't Read Good.

28:06.268 --> 28:07.643
What is this?

28:11.982 --> 28:14.025
A center for ants?

28:14.693 --> 28:15.777
What?

28:19.573 --> 28:22.867
How can we be expected to teach
children to learn how to read,

28:22.951 --> 28:25.953
if they can't even fit
inside the building?

28:27.998 --> 28:30.708
- Derek, it's just a small...
- I don't want to hear your excuses!

28:31.126 --> 28:33.628
The center has to be at least

28:35.756 --> 28:37.799
three times bigger than this.

28:40.552 --> 28:44.180
- He's absolutely right.
- Thank you.

28:45.265 --> 28:46.474
I have a vision.

28:46.892 --> 28:50.186
And so do I. Let me show you mine.

28:51.105 --> 28:53.815
I can't help you, lady. I don't
know nothing about Mugatu.

28:54.108 --> 28:56.609
But you've represented every male
model in each of his campaigns.

28:56.693 --> 28:58.694
You must have some kind of
a relationship with him.

28:58.779 --> 29:00.863
Even if I did, why
would I talk to you?

29:00.989 --> 29:04.075
Shame on you how you picked on
Derek Zoolander in that story.

29:04.159 --> 29:06.494
He's a sweet simpleton
who never hurt a fly.

29:06.578 --> 29:09.122
Please don't change the
subject, Mr Ballstein.

29:09.206 --> 29:12.166
What about Mugatu's exploitation
of sweatshop workers in Malaysia?

29:12.251 --> 29:14.669
- Do you have an opinion on that?
- You wanna hear an opinion?

29:14.753 --> 29:17.755
With a push-up bra, you could have a
nice rack of lamb going on there.

29:18.424 --> 29:21.843
Let me show you the
future of fashion.

29:23.220 --> 29:25.012
Let me show you

29:26.390 --> 29:28.057
Derelicte!

29:28.434 --> 29:30.601
It is a fashion, a way of life,

29:30.686 --> 29:33.604
inspired by the very
homeless, the vagrants,

29:33.689 --> 29:35.606
the crack whores

29:35.774 --> 29:38.025
that make this wonderful
city so unique.

29:39.194 --> 29:42.029
And I want you, Derek,
to be the face,

29:42.114 --> 29:46.159
the image, nay, the
spirit of Derelicte!

29:47.453 --> 29:49.662
It'll be your glorious comeback.

29:49.746 --> 29:51.372
Sounds cool.

29:51.457 --> 29:56.127
Derek, I'd like you to meet
Katinka Ingabogovinanana.

29:56.712 --> 29:59.297
She'll be your day-to-day
on the campaign.

30:00.466 --> 30:02.675
Let's get this model on his way!

30:03.385 --> 30:05.636
The big show is in
eight days, Derek.

30:06.096 --> 30:12.226
Like a caterpillar becomes a butterfly,
so must you become Derelicte!

30:12.311 --> 30:14.270
So you want me to
sleep in the gutter?

30:14.354 --> 30:17.690
No. We're sending you to a
very exclusive day spa.

30:18.484 --> 30:22.445
So exclusive, no one knows about it.
Our little secret, okay?

30:30.621 --> 30:32.830
- Matilda, hey.
- Hey, Arch, what's up?

30:32.915 --> 30:34.499
Nothing. I've just been
up for a few days,

30:34.583 --> 30:37.502
putting together these background
articles on Mugatu you asked for.

30:37.586 --> 30:40.338
Wow! Very thorough, Archie.
Thank you.

30:40.756 --> 30:43.674
It's weird. I couldn't get
any info on him before 1995.

30:43.759 --> 30:45.009
It's like he just
appeared out of the blue.

30:45.093 --> 30:47.345
- Really? That's strange.
- Yeah.

30:49.014 --> 30:51.724
- Matilda Jeffries.
- Keep pulling the sweater.

30:51.850 --> 30:55.436
- Excuse me?
- Eventually the thing will unravel.

30:56.104 --> 31:00.233
You mean, if you pull the thread,
the whole thing will unravel?

31:00.567 --> 31:03.986
Now you're talking, sister. If you
want to know more, go to Pier 12.

31:04.112 --> 31:06.239
Things aren't what they seem.

31:15.791 --> 31:17.959
What kind of spa is this?

31:19.253 --> 31:24.131
It's designed for deep, deep relaxation.
Come, let's get you loosened up.

31:34.476 --> 31:37.395
Good boy. Good boy.

31:37.563 --> 31:38.563
Good boy.

32:07.676 --> 32:08.926
I'm sorry.

32:09.511 --> 32:10.511
Derek?

32:12.389 --> 32:15.099
Matilda, what are you doing here?

32:15.517 --> 32:16.684
I was...

32:20.856 --> 32:24.108
What are you doing here, Derek? I
thought you quit the business.

32:24.443 --> 32:27.695
Haven't you heard? I'm the new face
of Mugatu's Derelicte campaign.

32:32.117 --> 32:34.827
What do you mean, Derek? You
said Mugatu never hires you.

32:35.037 --> 32:36.579
Well, I guess he changed his mind.

32:36.872 --> 32:39.165
It's only the biggest
campaign in the world. Ever.

32:39.374 --> 32:42.084
What is this? Who are you?

32:42.336 --> 32:44.420
This is private property. Nils!

32:48.258 --> 32:52.011
I suggest you and your Kmart
Jaclyn Smith Collection outfit,

32:52.220 --> 32:55.514
stay the hell away
from Derek Zoolander.

33:02.522 --> 33:04.231
How do you feel, Derek?

33:06.860 --> 33:07.860
Okay.

33:09.196 --> 33:10.780
When's the seaweed wrap?

33:10.864 --> 33:11.906
You shut up now.

33:12.574 --> 33:15.534
I want you to relax

33:16.203 --> 33:19.622
and breathe deeply.

33:23.001 --> 33:24.919
Breathe deeply.

33:31.677 --> 33:34.804
- I like this song.
- Of course you do.

33:37.432 --> 33:39.266
Hello, Derek.

33:39.935 --> 33:41.060
Hello.

33:41.687 --> 33:44.021
Welcome to your relaxation time.

33:44.773 --> 33:49.318
Let this wonderful '80s
classic soothe you.

33:49.403 --> 33:52.405
Just a nice, warm, happy time.

33:52.614 --> 33:56.617
Happy, happy, happy.

34:00.080 --> 34:02.456
Nothing to worry about at all.

34:02.958 --> 34:05.042
Just relax.

34:07.003 --> 34:09.714
Hey there, Derek. My
name is Lit' Kteatus.

34:10.674 --> 34:14.342
I'm just a kid who wants you to know the
real truth about child labour laws.

34:14.469 --> 34:16.469
- Okay?
- Okay.

34:16.638 --> 34:19.598
They're silly and outdated.
In the good old days,

34:19.683 --> 34:22.810
kids as young as five could
work as they pleased,

34:22.893 --> 34:25.855
from textile factories
to iron smelts.

34:25.938 --> 34:27.940
Yippee! Hooray!

34:28.442 --> 34:32.069
But today, the age-old right of
children to work is under attack.

34:32.821 --> 34:36.322
From the Philippines to
Bangladesh, in China and India,

34:36.408 --> 34:38.324
and South America, too.

34:39.953 --> 34:42.455
But you can help these
children, Derek,

34:42.539 --> 34:45.498
by killing the prime
minister of Malaysia.

34:45.667 --> 34:47.668
- He is bad.
- What?

34:48.795 --> 34:50.838
You learn martial arts.

34:52.799 --> 34:55.134
Prime minister of Malaysia bad!

34:55.217 --> 34:56.886
Martial arts good!

34:57.053 --> 35:01.515
Kill naughty man! Kill naughty man!
Kill naughty man!

35:02.142 --> 35:03.726
Obey my dog!

35:03.977 --> 35:06.645
On the runway, you
have one objective.

35:07.105 --> 35:11.275
Do not be distracted by the
beautiful cetebrities.

35:13.695 --> 35:19.283
Do as you've been trained to do and
kill the Malaysian prime minister!

35:19.367 --> 35:23.204
Karate chop! Bad, man! Awful man!

35:23.288 --> 35:26.832
In your little blue suit and
your spiky black hair. Kill!

35:26.917 --> 35:29.543
You're a super-hot ninja machine!

35:39.387 --> 35:42.056
- Derek, are you in there?
- Hold your horses!

35:42.182 --> 35:45.518
- Derek, please open the door!
- What a cuckoo dream.

35:45.602 --> 35:46.602
Derek!

35:48.480 --> 35:50.981
- What?
- Hey, are you okay?

35:51.066 --> 35:53.067
I've been trying to
reach you for a week.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.319
A week? What, are you
having a whack attack?

35:55.403 --> 35:57.530
I saw you this afternoon, dum-dum.

35:57.864 --> 35:59.365
That was last Friday.

35:59.825 --> 36:02.368
Earth to Matilda. I
was at a day spa.

36:03.036 --> 36:07.414
Day. D-A-I-Y-E. Okay?

36:08.667 --> 36:10.125
Look, I think I know
what this is about,

36:10.210 --> 36:14.338
and I'm very complimented,
but not interested.

36:15.257 --> 36:17.758
- What?
- I can't sleep with you, okay?

36:17.843 --> 36:20.553
- My head is killing me and...
- What are you talking about?

36:20.637 --> 36:22.596
Okay, if you just want to
fool around a little bit...

36:22.931 --> 36:25.266
Hey, I don't want
to sleep with you!

36:25.350 --> 36:27.518
I've been trying to tell you
you've been missing for a week.

36:27.602 --> 36:28.644
Would you look at the date.

36:28.728 --> 36:31.730
Mugatu's Derelicte show
is tomorrow night.

36:31.815 --> 36:33.983
I don't care what the date says.

36:35.944 --> 36:38.612
You have 1,200 messages.

36:40.448 --> 36:41.824
That is a bit above average.

36:42.200 --> 36:45.119
- Derek, what happened in that spa?
- I don't know.

36:45.203 --> 36:47.496
A little massage,
some aromatherapy.

36:47.581 --> 36:51.333
I mean, look, lady, you can't just
come barging into people's lofts,

36:51.418 --> 36:53.419
wanting sex, then
changing your mind,

36:53.503 --> 36:55.880
then telling them that they've
been in a day spa for a week.

36:55.964 --> 36:58.007
You have been in a
day spa for a week.

36:58.091 --> 36:59.633
So what?

36:59.718 --> 37:02.887
Do you understand that the world
does not revolve around you,

37:02.971 --> 37:05.973
and your "do whatever it takes,
ruin as many people's lives",

37:06.099 --> 37:08.893
"so long as you can make a name for
yourself as a investigatory journalist,

37:08.977 --> 37:10.436
"no matter how many
friends you lose,

37:10.520 --> 37:13.188
"or people you leave dead
and bloodied along the way,

37:13.273 --> 37:15.065
"just so long as you can
make a name for yourself

37:15.150 --> 37:16.317
"as an investigatory journalist,

37:16.401 --> 37:18.360
"no matter how many
friends you lose,

37:18.445 --> 37:22.156
"or people you leave dead and
bloodied and dying along the way"?

37:23.992 --> 37:26.327
Derek, I told you I was
sorry about that article.

37:26.453 --> 37:28.913
Enough! My head hurts!

37:28.997 --> 37:30.664
And if it indeed is what
day you claim it is,

37:30.749 --> 37:33.709
I have a pre-runway party to
attend, if you'll excuse me.

37:37.172 --> 37:39.506
- By the way...
- What?

37:39.841 --> 37:41.008
With your complexion,

37:41.092 --> 37:43.177
you really shouldn't be wearing
your hair pulled back that tight.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.095
What are you talking about?

37:45.180 --> 37:46.889
It pulls back the skin
on your forehead,

37:46.973 --> 37:48.933
creating a tension
which clogs the pores.

37:49.017 --> 37:51.644
That's why you have some light
pattern dryness around your scalp.

37:52.979 --> 37:54.021
Do you mind?

38:03.156 --> 38:04.448
Cool.

38:16.044 --> 38:20.798
I do not like snoopy reporter
with lack of fashion sense.

38:20.882 --> 38:23.384
Not one little bit.

38:27.222 --> 38:29.682
Hey, I just e-mailed you all
those LexisNexis searches,

38:29.766 --> 38:32.810
on the male models who've
appeared in Mugatu campaigns.

38:32.894 --> 38:36.271
It's pretty weird. It seems
like all of Mr Mugatu's models

38:36.356 --> 38:39.650
have a bad habit of dying
young in freak accidents.

38:39.734 --> 38:40.776
What?

38:48.493 --> 38:50.494
- Wait a second.
- What?

39:00.922 --> 39:03.590
- Oh, shit. I gotta go.
- What's going on?

39:06.803 --> 39:08.804
I don't want to hang out, okay?

39:08.930 --> 39:11.390
I just need to speak with
Derek Zoolander, please!

39:11.599 --> 39:14.727
I just thought the way you handled
losing that award to Hansel,

39:14.811 --> 39:17.521
and then you sort of
laid low for a while,

39:17.605 --> 39:19.648
and then made your comeback...

39:19.733 --> 39:21.567
It was so courageous.

39:22.110 --> 39:23.819
Look, I gotta go pee,

39:23.903 --> 39:26.655
but I'd really like to continue
talking about this conversation

39:26.740 --> 39:27.865
when I come back.

39:28.116 --> 39:29.199
Yeah.

39:31.536 --> 39:34.329
- Everything cool, Derek?
- It's great, Biff. Thank you.

39:36.332 --> 39:38.500
Hey, Derek. You rule.

39:38.793 --> 39:40.961
Thanks, Paris. I appreciate that.

39:41.296 --> 39:44.214
- Hey, Derek.
- Hey, Maurice.

39:44.340 --> 39:47.092
- Hey, my man.
- What's happening?

39:48.344 --> 39:50.262
Derek, back on top, man.

39:50.680 --> 39:52.431
Thanks, Billy. You rock.

39:52.724 --> 39:55.142
No, you rock. When are you gonna
drop Magnum on us, buddy?

39:55.351 --> 39:58.729
Not yet. Gotta tame the beast
before you let it out of its cage.

40:02.484 --> 40:05.694
- Excuse me, bro.
- You're excused.

40:10.116 --> 40:11.784
And I'm not your bro.

40:14.079 --> 40:18.165
Whatever, dude. Whatever.
Peace. God bless.

40:18.500 --> 40:22.544
Hey, Hansel, I'm sorry you didn't
get Mugatu's Derelicte campaign.

40:23.171 --> 40:24.421
Maybe next time.

40:25.548 --> 40:26.799
What's that?

40:27.050 --> 40:30.344
Mugatu's Derelicte campaign.
Sorry you didn't book it.

40:30.887 --> 40:33.097
Oh, yeah? I've never
even heard of it.

40:33.181 --> 40:34.640
Me and my friends
have been too busy

40:34.724 --> 40:36.308
bathing off the southern
coast of St Barts,

40:36.392 --> 40:38.060
with spider monkeys for
the past two weeks.

40:38.394 --> 40:41.230
Tripping on acid changed our
whole perspective on shit.

40:41.689 --> 40:46.401
So I guess you can Dere-lick
my balls, cápitan.

40:49.531 --> 40:51.365
Would you hold this for me?

40:53.201 --> 40:56.912
I can Dere-lick my own
balls, thank you very much.

41:00.375 --> 41:02.459
You think you're too
cool for school.

41:03.336 --> 41:06.255
But I got a news flash for
you, Walter Cronkite.

41:10.885 --> 41:12.052
You aren't.

41:16.516 --> 41:19.059
Who are you trying to
get crazy with, ese?

41:20.728 --> 41:22.563
Don't you know I'm loco?

41:24.399 --> 41:26.400
Hey, I got a wacky idea.

41:28.403 --> 41:31.572
What say we settle
this on the runway?

41:31.739 --> 41:35.159
Han-solo?

41:42.709 --> 41:44.084
Stop it.

41:45.503 --> 41:48.005
Are you challenging
me to a walk-off

41:48.089 --> 41:50.257
Boo-lander?

41:51.426 --> 41:53.385
Don't do this, Derek.

41:53.511 --> 41:55.304
Listen to your friend Billy Zane.

41:56.598 --> 42:00.475
He's a cool dude. He's
trying to help you out.

42:00.852 --> 42:04.605
Oh, yeah. That's a walk-off
challenge, my friend.

42:09.319 --> 42:12.154
Ten minutes. Old Members
Only warehouse.

42:12.238 --> 42:14.364
You oughta remember that.
You're a dinosaur.

42:14.616 --> 42:16.116
Let's go. Open up.

42:20.747 --> 42:23.457
I heard some mad stories about this kid.
He's limber. He's too limber.

42:23.541 --> 42:25.626
Put a cork in it, Zane!

42:28.004 --> 42:30.631
It's a walk-off. Walk-off.

42:30.924 --> 42:33.800
This is urgent, ma'am.
Do you have any...

42:35.345 --> 42:38.472
Derek? Derek! Derek!

42:38.556 --> 42:39.598
Hey, Matilda.

42:39.682 --> 42:41.767
What is this? Where
is everyone going?

42:41.851 --> 42:44.102
Good luck, Derek!
Kick Hansel's ass!

42:44.187 --> 42:45.812
Thanks, Rico. I'll try.

42:46.397 --> 42:48.273
You want to see the real
world of male modelling?

42:48.358 --> 42:51.109
The one they don't show you in
magazines or the E! channel?

42:51.194 --> 42:53.612
Yeah, I guess. Derek, please.

42:53.696 --> 42:55.781
I have something really
important to talk to you about.

42:55.865 --> 42:57.074
Not now, Matilda.

42:57.158 --> 42:59.910
Han-sell-out is about to
have his Han-sell-ass

42:59.994 --> 43:03.413
handed to him on a platter
with french-fried potatoes.

43:03.539 --> 43:06.166
Katinka, thought you
might want to know,

43:06.251 --> 43:08.418
your boy Zoolander's rolling.

43:08.503 --> 43:10.003
It's a walk-off.

43:32.860 --> 43:34.987
All right, who's gonna
call this sucker?

43:35.071 --> 43:36.571
If nobody has any objections,

43:38.408 --> 43:40.033
I believe I might be of service.

43:47.041 --> 43:50.377
Now, this'll be a straight
walk-off, old school rules.

43:50.503 --> 43:53.380
First model walks,
second model duplicates,

43:53.464 --> 43:54.756
then elaborates.

43:55.425 --> 43:57.759
Okay, boys, let's go to work.

43:58.219 --> 44:00.304
Age before beauty, goat cheese.

44:00.388 --> 44:01.763
Whatever.

44:05.184 --> 44:06.184
Right.

44:36.257 --> 44:37.758
Playschool, baby.

45:08.414 --> 45:10.540
You got to cut me. I can't see.
I'm blind out there.

45:10.625 --> 45:11.625
Evian. Evian.

45:15.088 --> 45:16.713
It's okay. It's okay.

45:30.228 --> 45:31.978
- Where am I? Where am I?
- It's okay.

45:32.897 --> 45:35.899
- Kickin', Hoss.
- I'm going monk.

45:37.777 --> 45:40.445
I got to go monk. Prayer. Prayer.

45:40.530 --> 45:41.738
Pray to the Great Spirit.

45:57.880 --> 46:00.674
Do it, Hansel. Just do it.
Do it, Hansel.

46:03.177 --> 46:05.512
Why is he sticking his
hand in his pants?

46:08.683 --> 46:09.683
Do it, Hansel.

46:29.120 --> 46:30.287
That's what I'm talking about.

46:30.371 --> 46:34.749
Derek, you're not a kid any more.
You could hurt yourself out there.

46:37.378 --> 46:39.045
I can do this, Tyson.

46:49.724 --> 46:52.058
Thank God I wore underwear today.

47:01.027 --> 47:02.152
He's going for it.

47:23.799 --> 47:25.258
Oh, my God.

47:35.311 --> 47:36.603
Disqualified.

47:44.028 --> 47:45.195
Derek, come on. Come on.

47:45.279 --> 47:46.988
Come on.

47:47.365 --> 47:49.032
What's going on?

47:49.116 --> 47:51.201
I think Katinka wants to kill you.

47:51.285 --> 47:55.956
Good. I deserve to die if I can't
beat Han-suck-ass in a walk-off.

47:56.791 --> 47:58.208
Derek, that's not true.

47:58.834 --> 48:01.628
The guy had to miraculously pull
his underwear out of his butt

48:01.712 --> 48:02.963
just to beat you.

48:05.883 --> 48:07.842
And all he had to
do was turn left.

48:10.221 --> 48:11.888
What do you mean?

48:12.431 --> 48:14.015
I'm not an ambi-turner.

48:15.476 --> 48:17.686
It's a problem I had
since I was a baby.

48:18.688 --> 48:20.063
I can't turn left.

48:21.190 --> 48:23.984
Derek, that's nothing
to be ashamed of.

48:24.277 --> 48:27.279
I'm sure there are a lot of people
out there who can't turn...

48:31.117 --> 48:33.910
I mean, there have got to
be some people out there,

48:33.995 --> 48:36.663
just like you, who can't turn...

48:37.164 --> 48:39.833
Turn left.

48:41.919 --> 48:42.919
Hello.

48:43.004 --> 48:45.755
If you want answers, come to
Saint Adonis Cemetery now.

48:45.840 --> 48:47.799
Wait! Wait! Wait! Who are you?

48:48.509 --> 48:49.509
Who was that?

48:49.594 --> 48:52.762
I'm not sure. I have to get
to Saint Adonis Cemetery.

48:52.847 --> 48:54.264
Listen, I'm gonna take you
to my apartment, okay?

48:54.348 --> 48:56.099
You can stay there
until I get back.

48:56.350 --> 48:57.851
Can I come with?

48:58.853 --> 49:00.770
I don't want to be alone tonight.

49:13.075 --> 49:14.701
Pedro Scialfa.

49:16.370 --> 49:18.288
He died when he was 29.

49:21.709 --> 49:23.209
Vin Correjo.

49:25.087 --> 49:27.881
"Derriere Extraordinaire."

49:31.927 --> 49:34.679
92 minus 63.

49:35.431 --> 49:37.390
None of them ever made it past 30.

49:38.851 --> 49:39.851
I did.

49:41.479 --> 49:42.520
Who are you?

49:43.898 --> 49:45.190
It's not important.

49:45.650 --> 49:47.108
Are you a ghost?

49:49.445 --> 49:51.237
He called, Derek.

49:52.156 --> 49:53.573
Let's take a walk.

49:54.450 --> 49:58.119
You think Zoolander's in trouble?
Think again.

49:58.496 --> 50:01.581
What you've stumbled upon goes way
deeper than you could ever fathom.

50:02.124 --> 50:04.167
The fashion industry
has been behind,

50:04.251 --> 50:08.421
every major political assassination
over the last 200 years.

50:08.547 --> 50:12.967
And behind every hit, a
card-carrying male model.

50:13.344 --> 50:14.844
Okay, that's impossible.

50:14.929 --> 50:17.764
Oh, yeah? Listen and
learn, sweetness.

50:17.973 --> 50:20.684
Abe Lincoln wanted to
abolish slavery, right?

50:20.768 --> 50:22.185
But who do you think
made the powdered wigs

50:22.269 --> 50:25.355
and coloured leg stockings, worn
by our country's early leaders?

50:27.191 --> 50:28.441
Mugatu!

50:30.486 --> 50:31.903
Slaves, Derek.

50:33.698 --> 50:37.492
Without their free labour, prices on
such items would have gone up tenfold.

50:37.660 --> 50:40.537
So the powers that be
hired John Wilkes Booth,

50:40.621 --> 50:43.957
the originat model/actor,
to do Mr Lincoln in.

50:45.876 --> 50:47.127
I'll go on.

50:47.420 --> 50:50.255
Dallas, Texas, 1963.

50:50.464 --> 50:52.882
Kennedy had just put a
trade embargo on Cuba,

50:52.967 --> 50:56.678
ostensibly halting the shipment
of Cuban-manufactured slacks.

50:56.804 --> 50:58.471
Incredibly popular
item at the time.

50:58.806 --> 51:01.015
Lee Harvey Oswald was
not a male model.

51:01.100 --> 51:02.142
You're God damn right he wasn't.

51:02.226 --> 51:03.768
But those two lookers
who capped Kennedy

51:03.853 --> 51:05.729
from the grassy knoll
sure as shit were.

51:07.440 --> 51:08.773
Well, what about you?

51:08.858 --> 51:10.442
How do you fit in to all this?

51:11.110 --> 51:12.318
This nation was swept...

51:13.279 --> 51:14.654
I'll get it, ma'am.

51:20.327 --> 51:22.495
I can't get over...

51:22.872 --> 51:23.997
Wait a minute.

51:25.791 --> 51:28.001
- No.
- I know that hand.

51:29.962 --> 51:33.214
It was in the fall 1973
Bulova watch catalogue.

51:35.176 --> 51:36.468
You're J. P. Prewitt.

51:38.387 --> 51:40.263
The world's greatest hand model.

51:41.974 --> 51:45.727
Once upon a time.
But things change.

51:46.353 --> 51:48.271
Thanks to this homemade
hyperbaric chamber,

51:48.355 --> 51:50.106
my sweet baby never did.

51:52.151 --> 51:54.027
Let's keep moving.

51:54.695 --> 51:58.323
And that's when I found out I was in
line to assassinate Jimmy Carter.

51:58.407 --> 52:01.534
- So, how did you manage to escape?
- Because I'm a hand model, mama.

52:02.411 --> 52:04.120
A finger jockey. We don't
think the same way

52:04.205 --> 52:06.289
as the face and body boys do.

52:06.373 --> 52:09.626
- We're a different breed.
- So why male models?

52:09.960 --> 52:11.127
Think about it, Derek.

52:11.879 --> 52:15.215
Male models are genetically
constructed to become assassins.

52:15.633 --> 52:17.258
They're in peak
physical condition.

52:20.054 --> 52:23.056
They can gain entry to the most
secure places in the world.

52:25.267 --> 52:28.770
And most important of all, models
don't think for themselves.

52:28.854 --> 52:32.065
- They do as they're told.
- That is not true.

52:32.149 --> 52:34.234
- Yes, it is, Derek.
- Okay.

52:35.277 --> 52:38.404
Yeah. Think about any photo
shoot you've ever been on.

52:39.698 --> 52:41.950
You're a monkey, Derek!
You're a monkey.

52:42.034 --> 52:44.953
Dance, monkey, in your
little spangly shoes!

52:45.037 --> 52:47.622
Mash your cymbals, chimpy!
Dance, Derek, dance!

52:48.707 --> 52:50.166
Good point.

52:50.251 --> 52:53.002
But if this has been going
on for so long, Mugatu...

52:53.087 --> 52:54.963
He's just a punk-ass errand boy,

52:55.047 --> 52:57.549
working for an international
syndicate of fashion designers.

52:58.008 --> 53:00.760
You do a little background
check on your Mr Mugatu.

53:01.220 --> 53:04.931
You'll find that he sold his soul to
the devil for a shot at the big time.

53:06.058 --> 53:07.475
But why male models?

53:12.273 --> 53:15.984
Are you serious? I just... l
just told you that a moment ago.

53:16.694 --> 53:17.694
Right.

53:17.778 --> 53:21.155
You're a killing machine, Derek.
They've programmed you.

53:21.240 --> 53:23.074
But I won't do it. I
won't kill anybody.

53:23.158 --> 53:24.367
It's not up to you.

53:24.451 --> 53:26.286
At the proper moment,
they'll trigger you,

53:26.370 --> 53:28.079
usually using some
kind of auditory

53:28.163 --> 53:30.290
or visual Pavlovian
response mechanism.

53:30.374 --> 53:33.001
- "Audi-what-ey"?
- And when it's over...

53:35.254 --> 53:36.254
What?

53:37.756 --> 53:39.299
There's an after party?

53:41.135 --> 53:42.468
Derek, get down!

53:45.723 --> 53:48.182
You got to get to Maury
Ballstein's computer.

53:48.601 --> 53:52.645
He recorded everything in
case they ever turned on him.

53:54.773 --> 53:57.066
Derek, get a grip! Get a grip!

53:57.151 --> 54:01.613
Good luck to you, Derek. I've
always been a fan of Blue Steel.

54:02.406 --> 54:04.741
And I hear Magnum is
gonna blow us all away.

54:05.993 --> 54:07.076
Come on!

54:08.162 --> 54:10.830
- Get out of here.
- Hang in there, J. P.

54:12.917 --> 54:14.334
You freakin' idiot!

54:18.964 --> 54:20.548
Man, that was close.

54:20.633 --> 54:22.967
I can't believe Maury's
in on it, too.

54:23.052 --> 54:25.386
That she-male Katinka's
not messing around.

54:25.471 --> 54:27.096
You're telling me!
For a second there,

54:27.181 --> 54:29.432
I thought someone was gonna
be reading our "eugoogoly."

54:29.516 --> 54:31.851
Okay, all right, we
need a place to hide.

54:31.936 --> 54:34.646
Derek, where's the last place anyone
would ever expect to look for you?

54:35.064 --> 54:36.272
I don't know.

54:36.357 --> 54:38.650
Think, okay? This is important!

54:44.365 --> 54:45.615
I hate Hansel!

54:45.699 --> 54:49.035
Hansel, Hansel! Everywhere I look!
Hansel! Hansel, Hansel!

54:59.171 --> 55:00.797
Were you looking for a rematch?

55:01.966 --> 55:03.007
Excuse me, Hansel.

55:03.092 --> 55:05.009
I don't think there's an
easy way to put this,

55:05.094 --> 55:06.719
so I am just gonna lay it out.

55:07.054 --> 55:09.889
Derek has been brainwashed

55:11.141 --> 55:13.518
to kill the prime
minister of Malaysia.

55:14.520 --> 55:15.561
And?

55:16.563 --> 55:20.191
And we need a place to hide until
we figure this whole thing out.

55:20.275 --> 55:22.068
Derek said this would probably be

55:22.152 --> 55:24.112
the last place anyone
would look for him.

55:25.948 --> 55:27.907
Yeah, you're cool to hide here.

55:28.951 --> 55:31.285
But first, me and him got to
straighten some shit out.

55:33.330 --> 55:34.414
Fine.

55:36.083 --> 55:42.213
Why you been acting so
messed up towards me?

55:48.429 --> 55:49.762
Well, you go first.

55:51.056 --> 55:53.057
I don't know. Maybe I felt a
little threatened or something,

55:53.142 --> 55:56.102
'cause your career is,
kind of, just blossoming,

55:56.186 --> 55:58.855
and mine's, kind of,
winding down or whatever.

55:58.939 --> 56:01.607
And I felt like, "This
guy's really hurting me,"

56:02.985 --> 56:04.318
and it hurt.

56:06.613 --> 56:09.699
And I felt like when you told
me to Dere-lick my balls,

56:09.783 --> 56:11.159
that really hurt.

56:11.452 --> 56:14.871
Maybe I was scared, man.
You're Derek Zoolander!

56:16.623 --> 56:18.708
Yeah, you're Derek Zoolander.

56:18.792 --> 56:20.376
You know what it's like
to be another model

56:20.461 --> 56:22.962
and be in Derek
Zoolander's shadow?

56:27.509 --> 56:29.135
You want to hear something crazy?

56:32.347 --> 56:34.390
Your work

56:34.475 --> 56:38.144
in the winter '95
International Male catalogue

56:43.901 --> 56:45.860
made me want to be a model.

56:49.448 --> 56:51.657
I freakin' worship you, man.

56:54.620 --> 56:56.120
I'm sorry I was whack.

56:56.747 --> 57:00.124
I was whack.

57:09.593 --> 57:11.094
So welcome to chez Hansel.

57:11.345 --> 57:13.262
You're welcome to hide out
here as long as you want.

57:13.347 --> 57:15.848
Well, there isn't much time.
The show's tomorrow night.

57:15.933 --> 57:17.683
We have to figure
out a plan by then.

57:19.394 --> 57:21.646
I'll round up the troops here.

57:22.022 --> 57:24.982
Hey, what's up, y'all?
This is Derek and Matilda.

57:25.359 --> 57:27.360
Derek, you know Natani and Chloe.

57:27.486 --> 57:28.486
Hi!

57:28.695 --> 57:32.073
We got Buzzy Sullivan, big
wave surfer from Maverick's.

57:32.157 --> 57:33.116
Hey, bra.

57:33.200 --> 57:35.576
This is this fantastic
band, the Little Kings,

57:35.661 --> 57:37.870
I met when I was ice
sailing in Finland.

57:38.497 --> 57:40.414
That's my Sherpa, Lapsang.

57:40.499 --> 57:43.042
Okay, so, hey, everybody!
Listen up for a second.

57:44.711 --> 57:47.588
Derek and Matilda are in hiding
'cause some dudes brainwashed Derek,

57:47.673 --> 57:49.757
to off the prime
minister of Micronesia.

57:49.842 --> 57:51.634
- Malaysia.
- Right.

57:51.718 --> 57:54.137
So, they're gonna be hiding
here for a little while.

57:54.221 --> 57:55.429
Let's show them a good time.

57:55.639 --> 57:57.974
- Right on!
- All right, come on, over here.

57:58.267 --> 58:00.393
Hey, Ennui, will you
do me a favour?

58:00.519 --> 58:02.478
Will you get me some of that
tea that me and Lapsang got,

58:02.563 --> 58:04.147
when we were free
climbing the Mayan ruins?

58:10.737 --> 58:14.073
This... This is really strong tea.

58:15.409 --> 58:17.201
No, it's just right. Trust me.

58:17.286 --> 58:19.912
What with all the intrigue you
guys have been dealing with.

58:20.706 --> 58:24.709
You know, Matilda, I'm surprised
you're so worried about "Der-rock."

58:26.253 --> 58:28.004
From that article that
I read, it seems like

58:28.088 --> 58:30.798
you don't really care too much
about guys in our line of work.

58:32.050 --> 58:34.093
Why do you hate models, Matilda?

58:35.304 --> 58:37.597
- Honestly?
- Yes.

58:39.099 --> 58:43.936
I think they're vain, stupid
and incredibly self-centred.

58:45.022 --> 58:46.606
I totally agree with you.

58:48.358 --> 58:50.943
But how do you feel
about male models?

58:51.278 --> 58:52.528
Sweet.

58:54.948 --> 58:59.160
No, no! Okay, but seriously, Matil.
Is it all right if I call you Matil?

59:01.205 --> 59:02.914
What's the deal, yo-yo?

59:03.540 --> 59:05.458
'Cause you're not telling
us the whole story.

59:05.542 --> 59:07.460
There's something
else, isn't there?

59:07.794 --> 59:09.879
You guys really want
to know the truth?

59:09.963 --> 59:13.341
- Yeah.
- Okay, then I'm gonna tell you the truth.

59:15.677 --> 59:20.932
When I was in seventh grade, I
was the fat kid in my class.

59:25.854 --> 59:27.396
All right, forget it.

59:27.981 --> 59:30.399
- No.
- Dude, be cool tonight. Come on.

59:30.484 --> 59:32.944
I'm sorry. Please, go ahead.
My mistake.

59:34.279 --> 59:36.948
I was the one that all the pretty
girls used to make fun of.

59:37.032 --> 59:39.867
It was an awkward phase.

59:42.204 --> 59:44.080
Anyway,

59:44.164 --> 59:46.916
every day after school, I
would come home and...

59:48.001 --> 59:52.255
You know, I'd flip through the pages
of my mom's Vogue and Glamour.

59:52.339 --> 59:55.508
And I just...

59:55.592 --> 59:56.926
I'd look at these women,

59:57.010 --> 01:00:00.846
these perfect, beautiful,

01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:04.517
just unbelievable, skinny women.

01:00:05.018 --> 01:00:06.852
I just couldn't...

01:00:06.937 --> 01:00:09.897
Oh, I couldn't understand why
I didn't look like them.

01:00:11.358 --> 01:00:13.943
I... I just didn't get it. So...

01:00:16.822 --> 01:00:20.032
So I became...

01:00:23.745 --> 01:00:24.745
What?

01:00:27.833 --> 01:00:29.208
Bulimic.

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:33.587
You can read minds?

01:00:41.722 --> 01:00:44.598
It's when you throw
up after every meal.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.562
See, you know what? This is exactly
what you models do to people.

01:00:49.688 --> 01:00:51.814
You make them feel bad
about themselves.

01:00:51.898 --> 01:00:52.898
Matilda...

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:55.359
Matilda, it's just...

01:00:56.695 --> 01:01:00.448
So what? I throw up
after lots of meals.

01:01:00.782 --> 01:01:04.285
So do I. It's a great way to
lose pounds before a show.

01:01:04.911 --> 01:01:08.122
Are you guys insane? Do you
understand that it's a disease.

01:01:08.206 --> 01:01:11.917
Wow. How did that affect you with guys?
Did they not want to get busy with you?

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:14.378
- Good point.
- Okay. You know what?

01:01:14.463 --> 01:01:19.091
I'm not gonna sit here with both of
you and discuss my sex life or...

01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:23.763
Or lack thereof.

01:01:25.599 --> 01:01:28.184
You mean, like, like
you, like you...

01:01:28.268 --> 01:01:29.935
- Haven't really...
- You haven't...

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:32.772
- Done it...
- Done it in a while, yeah.

01:01:33.106 --> 01:01:35.649
Okay, what's a while?
Like, eight days?

01:01:38.028 --> 01:01:39.111
More?

01:01:41.281 --> 01:01:44.116
Try a couple years.

01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:46.452
Oh, snap!

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:49.497
How do you live? How do you live?

01:01:49.581 --> 01:01:52.291
Seriously. Do you service
yourself ten times a day?

01:01:53.085 --> 01:01:55.669
- End of discussion!
- Easy. Okay, hold on.

01:01:55.754 --> 01:01:57.213
- Easy, easy.
- I'm not comfortable talking,

01:01:57.297 --> 01:01:59.006
- Easy. Easy.
- This is...

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.343
This has been an emotional
day for all of us.

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:09.517
I think we should get naked.

01:02:09.601 --> 01:02:10.601
What?

01:02:10.936 --> 01:02:12.686
Don't ask questions.

01:02:13.772 --> 01:02:15.940
Just give in to the
power of the tea.

01:02:59.025 --> 01:03:00.943
So I'm rappelling
down Mount Vesuvius,

01:03:01.027 --> 01:03:04.071
when suddenly I slip
and I start to fall.

01:03:04.156 --> 01:03:06.073
I mean, I'm about to die.
Hot bread, Zeke.

01:03:07.033 --> 01:03:10.536
Just falling. I'll never
forget the terror.

01:03:10.662 --> 01:03:14.290
When suddenly I remember, "Holy shit.
Hansel,"

01:03:14.374 --> 01:03:17.126
"haven't you been smoking
peyote for six straight days?"

01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:19.962
"And couldn't some of this,
maybe, be in your mind?"

01:03:20.046 --> 01:03:21.380
And?

01:03:22.674 --> 01:03:25.176
It was. I was totally fine.

01:03:25.385 --> 01:03:27.386
I've never even been
to Mount Vesuvius.

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:30.306
Cool story, Hansel.

01:03:30.682 --> 01:03:31.765
Thanks, Olaf.

01:03:33.351 --> 01:03:35.644
Dude, how dope was last night?

01:03:35.729 --> 01:03:38.063
I mean, the soil room.
Dirt was flying.

01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:40.691
You couldn't see anything.
It was like, who's that?

01:03:40.775 --> 01:03:43.694
- Who's this?
- I think I'm falling for Matilda, Hansel.

01:03:44.529 --> 01:03:47.114
Dude, I wasn't gonna say anything,

01:03:47.199 --> 01:03:50.451
but it was crazy energy flying
back and forth between you guys.

01:03:50.535 --> 01:03:52.119
It was like, look out!

01:03:52.204 --> 01:03:53.829
There was a moment last night,

01:03:53.914 --> 01:03:56.165
when she was sandwiched between
the two Finnish dwarves

01:03:56.249 --> 01:03:57.333
and the Maori tribesman...

01:03:59.044 --> 01:04:00.586
- Yeah.
- ...where I thought,

01:04:00.795 --> 01:04:05.466
"Wow, I could really spend the
rest of my life with this woman."

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:07.801
Really?

01:04:08.386 --> 01:04:10.304
What do you call that?

01:04:10.764 --> 01:04:13.098
I think you call
that love, D-Bone.

01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:14.267
Hey!

01:04:18.813 --> 01:04:20.439
So what time is it?

01:04:20.774 --> 01:04:23.067
- Almost 5:00.
- What?

01:04:23.318 --> 01:04:25.903
Hey, guys, that show
is in three hours.

01:04:25.987 --> 01:04:29.114
Derek is dead unless we get
that evidence. Do you guys...

01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:33.452
Easy. How about a "Good
afternoon, Derek and Hansel."

01:04:34.037 --> 01:04:36.080
"Thanks for the freak
fest last night"?

01:04:38.833 --> 01:04:40.834
- Hello?
- Hello?

01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:43.379
Hi, Katinka.

01:04:44.422 --> 01:04:47.007
No, I just had a really late
party night last night.

01:04:47.092 --> 01:04:49.885
- Derek, hang up the phone now!
- Where am I?

01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:50.928
- Look, I have to go!
- Hang up!

01:04:51.012 --> 01:04:52.513
But I'll see you at 7:00.
Okay, bye.

01:04:52.597 --> 01:04:55.140
Derek, I thought I told you
to turn off your phone.

01:04:55.892 --> 01:05:00.896
Turn off my phone?

01:05:00.981 --> 01:05:02.898
- Yeah.
- Earth to Matilda.

01:05:02.983 --> 01:05:05.734
This phone is as much
a part of me as...

01:05:05.819 --> 01:05:09.655
You know what? Can we just cut it out
with all the "Earth to's", please?

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:12.658
We're not actually saying this is
the Earth calling you, Matilda.

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:16.161
Yeah. No, I got that. I understand
you don't literally mean...

01:05:16.246 --> 01:05:18.122
No, I don't think you do.

01:05:18.498 --> 01:05:22.126
Listen. It's not like we think that
we're actually in a control tower,

01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:25.629
trying to reach outer space
aliens or something, okay?

01:05:25.797 --> 01:05:29.508
Hello.

01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:33.554
- Oh, snap!
- A joke.

01:05:34.306 --> 01:05:35.764
Okay, you know what?

01:05:35.849 --> 01:05:39.268
Instead of doing that, I'm gonna try
to figure out a way into Maury's,

01:05:39.352 --> 01:05:41.562
before Derek assassinates
a world leader.

01:05:44.232 --> 01:05:45.357
Wait a minute.

01:05:46.234 --> 01:05:47.610
I might just have an idea.

01:05:48.987 --> 01:05:51.196
They'll be looking for
us at Maury's, right?

01:05:52.032 --> 01:05:53.741
But they won't be looking for...

01:05:56.036 --> 01:05:57.036
Not us.

01:05:57.621 --> 01:05:59.371
Derek, what are you talking about?

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:02.541
Hansel, do you have
a cosmetics case?

01:06:02.626 --> 01:06:05.502
Sure, I mean, just for
touch-ups or whatever.

01:06:05.587 --> 01:06:07.129
What are you gonna do with that?

01:06:08.214 --> 01:06:10.549
That'll do. Early in my career,

01:06:10.634 --> 01:06:12.843
I used to do my own makeup
styling and tailoring.

01:06:12.927 --> 01:06:15.137
If I can create a basic
disguise for us,

01:06:15.221 --> 01:06:17.723
we may just be able to sneak
into Maury's, undetected.

01:06:18.933 --> 01:06:22.061
You is talkin' loco and I like it.

01:06:43.667 --> 01:06:50.756
Welcome to Derelicte.

01:06:53.426 --> 01:06:55.052
Hansel calling Matil.
Hansel calling Matil.

01:06:55.136 --> 01:06:56.178
We have entry. Repeat.

01:06:56.262 --> 01:06:58.263
- We have entry.
- Okay, guys. I hear you.

01:06:58.348 --> 01:07:01.100
Now, once you get the info, I want
you to e-mail it to my office

01:07:01.184 --> 01:07:02.434
and I'll download the files,

01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:04.770
we'll rendezvous and take the
information to the police.

01:07:04.854 --> 01:07:06.188
We hear you loud and clear.

01:07:08.775 --> 01:07:09.900
Listen, Matil.

01:07:10.485 --> 01:07:12.820
I've been thinking a lot
about that bulimia thing.

01:07:13.321 --> 01:07:16.865
And I want you to know I understand
where you're coming from.

01:07:17.617 --> 01:07:21.036
I feel really bad that
good-looking people like us,

01:07:21.121 --> 01:07:23.288
made you throw up and
feel bad about yourself.

01:07:24.207 --> 01:07:25.416
For serious.

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:29.795
- Thanks, Derek. Now, hurry up.
- Okay.

01:07:31.131 --> 01:07:32.506
Hey, I finally got the results

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:35.467
on the name check you asked
for on Jacobim Mugatu.

01:07:35.552 --> 01:07:38.345
- Or should I say Jacob Moogberg.
- What?

01:07:38.430 --> 01:07:40.848
He changed his name when he
went into the fashion business.

01:07:41.099 --> 01:07:43.726
Apparently, the guy was the
original guitar synth player,

01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:45.436
for that band Frankie
Goes to Hollywood,

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:47.020
but he got kicked out,
before they hit it big

01:07:47.105 --> 01:07:48.814
with that song Relax.

01:07:48.898 --> 01:07:50.774
After the Frankie folks
gave him the heave-ho,

01:07:50.859 --> 01:07:53.152
he held a series
of odd jobs until,

01:07:53.236 --> 01:07:57.573
get this, he invented the
piano-key necktie in 1985.

01:07:57.991 --> 01:08:00.033
The guy's been a fashion
designer ever since.

01:08:05.832 --> 01:08:07.249
First obstacle.

01:08:11.171 --> 01:08:12.921
You ever use one of these?

01:08:13.006 --> 01:08:14.465
I don't think so.

01:08:16.301 --> 01:08:19.094
Watch out. Watch...
Fix that hem, Jason.

01:08:19.179 --> 01:08:21.345
Please. I need... Katinka!

01:08:22.223 --> 01:08:23.932
He's not here yet, Jacobim.

01:08:24.017 --> 01:08:27.144
- That little toad-face better show.
- He will show.

01:08:27.228 --> 01:08:30.189
Good, because I'm a hot
little potato right now.

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:34.484
There must be an "on"
button somewhere.

01:08:34.861 --> 01:08:36.653
Did you press that apple thing?

01:09:24.077 --> 01:09:25.618
Wait! Hansel!

01:09:26.328 --> 01:09:27.662
Let's not lose our cool.

01:09:27.747 --> 01:09:29.206
Then we're no better
than the machine.

01:09:31.584 --> 01:09:33.710
It's almost 7:00. I got to go.

01:09:33.795 --> 01:09:36.212
No! Derek. Der, wait.

01:09:36.296 --> 01:09:38.674
If you go, they'll make you
kill that Eurasian dude.

01:09:38.758 --> 01:09:41.885
I don't care, Hansel. I've never
been late for a show in my life.

01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:43.804
I don't plan on starting now.

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:45.889
Damn it, you're right.

01:09:46.765 --> 01:09:48.600
Do me a favour.

01:09:48.685 --> 01:09:51.144
If anything happens to me, I want
you to give this to Matilda.

01:09:51.437 --> 01:09:54.731
- No.
- Please, Hansel. Take it. Please.

01:09:54.816 --> 01:09:56.775
- Man.
- Take it.

01:09:59.112 --> 01:10:03.198
Let's just say I'll hold on
to it till you get back.

01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:05.617
Go! Go!

01:10:06.452 --> 01:10:08.537
We're live at the Derelicte show,

01:10:08.621 --> 01:10:11.081
where controversial
designer Jacobim Mugatu,

01:10:11.165 --> 01:10:12.624
has extended the olive branch

01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:14.835
to the Malaysian Prime
Minister Hassan,

01:10:14.919 --> 01:10:17.129
making him the guest of
honour at tonight's show.

01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:20.924
And starring in that show, veteran
supermodel Derek Zootander.

01:10:24.137 --> 01:10:27.556
Guys, what's happening?
Did you find the files?

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:28.974
Matilda, we've got problems.

01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:30.893
Derek's already left for the show.

01:10:30.977 --> 01:10:33.604
No. No, he can't. We don't
even know what the trigger is.

01:10:33.688 --> 01:10:36.273
He just went running out of here.
I couldn't stop him.

01:10:36.733 --> 01:10:39.192
- I'll call him on his phone.
- He doesn't have it.

01:10:39.277 --> 01:10:41.236
- What?
- Yeah, he doesn't have it.

01:10:41.321 --> 01:10:43.447
What are you talking about?
He always has it.

01:10:43.531 --> 01:10:46.783
- No, he gave it to me.
- Did you find the files?

01:10:46.868 --> 01:10:49.077
I don't even know what they...
What do they look like?

01:10:49.162 --> 01:10:50.662
They're in the computer.

01:10:50.747 --> 01:10:52.956
They're in the computer?

01:10:53.291 --> 01:10:56.126
Yeah, they're definitely in there. I
just don't know how he labelled them.

01:10:56.210 --> 01:10:58.587
- I got it.
- You got to figure it out.

01:10:58.713 --> 01:11:00.213
We're running out of time, Hansel,

01:11:00.298 --> 01:11:02.466
you got to find them and
meet me at the show.

01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:03.926
Roger.

01:11:05.053 --> 01:11:06.887
In the computer.

01:11:07.722 --> 01:11:09.431
It's so simple.

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:13.435
Hey, I just cut up a couple
of cantaloupe halves,

01:11:13.519 --> 01:11:15.270
with some cottage cheese,
if you're hungry.

01:11:15.355 --> 01:11:17.940
Not the right time. I need
to figure out this trigger

01:11:18.024 --> 01:11:20.484
before Derek kills the
Malaysian prime minister.

01:11:20.568 --> 01:11:23.320
You just seem a little tense. I
was trying to help you relax.

01:11:23.404 --> 01:11:26.657
Relax? The last thing I
need to do right now is...

01:11:29.369 --> 01:11:31.161
- That's it.
- Let's go, people!

01:11:31.245 --> 01:11:34.706
Let's go! Vagrants and whores,
you're wanted in Makeup!

01:11:34.791 --> 01:11:36.708
Runaways and street
hustlers, you're next!

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:39.795
- You had us worried, Derek.
- Everything's cool.

01:11:39.879 --> 01:11:42.839
- I'm really super psyched for the show.
- Good.

01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:46.593
Just remember, relax.

01:11:47.387 --> 01:11:48.679
Two minutes, Derek.

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.099
There he is.

01:11:52.809 --> 01:11:55.560
I just want to wish you good luck.

01:11:56.729 --> 01:11:58.563
Don't you mean "Good-bye"?

01:11:59.065 --> 01:12:00.399
What are you talking?

01:12:04.612 --> 01:12:06.571
I know it was you, Maury.

01:12:06.698 --> 01:12:08.240
I know it was you,

01:12:08.658 --> 01:12:10.075
and it breaks my heart.

01:12:10.868 --> 01:12:12.703
Derek, I don't know
what you're talking.

01:12:15.581 --> 01:12:18.083
Derek, I'm...

01:12:20.712 --> 01:12:21.962
I'm sorry.

01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:31.054
Glad you could join us, Kmart.

01:12:32.348 --> 01:12:34.433
Lucky for you, there
is no dress code.

01:12:36.310 --> 01:12:38.770
I am vile spew

01:12:38.855 --> 01:12:40.689
of the wretched masses.

01:12:41.024 --> 01:12:45.193
I am really, really dirty.

01:12:45.445 --> 01:12:48.238
I am Derelicte!

01:13:03.046 --> 01:13:05.088
You make me sick to
my stomach, Jaco.

01:13:06.799 --> 01:13:08.675
It'll all be over soon.

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:11.803
Derek Zoolander will be
dead and you'll be fine.

01:13:12.638 --> 01:13:14.056
You always are.

01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:15.265
Come on, Derek. You're on.

01:13:17.977 --> 01:13:19.519
Break a leg, Derek.

01:13:51.677 --> 01:13:52.677
Derek...

01:13:53.679 --> 01:13:54.888
It's Relax!

01:13:54.972 --> 01:13:55.972
I hate you.

01:13:56.057 --> 01:13:58.558
I'm fine. I've done
this a thousand times.

01:13:59.894 --> 01:14:01.228
The trigger! It's...

01:14:13.032 --> 01:14:15.617
Concentrate, Derelicte.

01:14:16.869 --> 01:14:20.288
Do not be distracted by the
beautiful celebrities.

01:14:20.373 --> 01:14:22.040
Celebrities.

01:14:28.464 --> 01:14:33.051
Do what you've been trained to do and
kill the Malaysian prime minister!

01:14:47.191 --> 01:14:48.650
Just do it already!

01:14:58.578 --> 01:14:59.744
D-Bone, I got your back!

01:15:00.955 --> 01:15:01.997
What?

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:06.126
It's that damn Hansel!

01:15:06.419 --> 01:15:07.794
He's so hot right now!

01:15:09.589 --> 01:15:10.922
Popping and locking, fool!

01:15:13.926 --> 01:15:15.510
They're break-dance fighting.

01:16:20.826 --> 01:16:23.411
Derek Zoolander just tried to kill
the prime minister of Malaysia.

01:16:26.165 --> 01:16:28.750
That's bullshit!
Listen up, everyone.

01:16:28.834 --> 01:16:30.335
Mugatu's a dick!

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:34.005
He tried to brainwash Derek
to kill the Claymation dude.

01:16:36.175 --> 01:16:39.803
That's a lie! Zoolander snapped
because he's over the hill!

01:16:39.887 --> 01:16:41.972
He knew his career was over
and he couldn't face it.

01:16:42.056 --> 01:16:43.515
No way, compadre.

01:16:43.975 --> 01:16:47.560
We got 30 years of files
right here in this computer!

01:16:47.645 --> 01:16:49.396
They're gonna bring you down!

01:16:49.897 --> 01:16:51.189
Oh, no.

01:16:51.524 --> 01:16:52.524
Down!

01:16:56.821 --> 01:16:58.154
Where did all the files go?

01:17:00.324 --> 01:17:01.533
I'm taking you out!

01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:04.869
Yo, taste my pain, bitch!

01:17:09.417 --> 01:17:10.625
Yes!

01:17:11.335 --> 01:17:12.377
Deal with that!

01:17:16.048 --> 01:17:18.925
You don't have the guts, Kmart!

01:17:19.343 --> 01:17:21.344
Wanna bet? And by the way,

01:17:21.429 --> 01:17:23.305
you were wrong about my outfit.

01:17:23.389 --> 01:17:26.850
It's the Cheryl Ladd Collection,
and I got it at J.C. Penney.

01:17:27.476 --> 01:17:28.977
On sale.

01:17:33.941 --> 01:17:37.193
Jig's up, Mugatu. Everything
they're saying is true.

01:17:37.278 --> 01:17:39.571
I've been in on it for 30 years.

01:17:39.697 --> 01:17:41.448
What are you doing, Ballstein?

01:17:41.907 --> 01:17:45.493
I'm done, Jaco. I got a prostate
the size of a honeydew,

01:17:45.578 --> 01:17:47.329
and a head full of bad memories.

01:17:47.413 --> 01:17:49.331
It's time to set things straight.

01:17:49.415 --> 01:17:53.626
You have no evidence. Han-stupid
destroyed everything.

01:17:53.711 --> 01:17:57.339
I got two words for
you, sugar, Zip disc.

01:17:57.590 --> 01:18:00.508
The whole thing is in
my den in Long Island.

01:18:00.593 --> 01:18:02.886
I can have that evidence
here in 20 minutes.

01:18:02.970 --> 01:18:04.888
- That a boy, Maury.
- Hold on a second.

01:18:04.972 --> 01:18:06.431
I'm afraid of the radiation.

01:18:09.810 --> 01:18:12.354
Sheila, honey, it's me. Listen.

01:18:12.438 --> 01:18:15.940
I need you to bring that Zip disc in
the den down to the fashion show.

01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:19.944
I don't care what the
traffic is like.

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:23.865
Take the God damn service road
and get off before the bridge.

01:18:25.534 --> 01:18:27.744
So put it in one of those
Tupperware containers

01:18:27.828 --> 01:18:29.829
and I'll heat it up in the
microwave when I get home.

01:18:30.873 --> 01:18:34.626
For Christ's sake, it's a
casserole, Sheila! It'll stay!

01:18:36.128 --> 01:18:37.212
Shut up!

01:18:37.296 --> 01:18:39.255
Enough already, Ballstein!

01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:42.258
Who cares about Derek
Zoolander, anyway?

01:18:42.343 --> 01:18:45.470
The man has only one
look, for Christ's sake!

01:18:45.596 --> 01:18:48.431
Blue Steel, Ferrari, Le Tigre?

01:18:48.641 --> 01:18:50.266
They're the same face!

01:18:51.769 --> 01:18:55.855
Doesn't anyone notice this? I
feel like I'm taking crazy pills!

01:18:57.525 --> 01:19:00.610
I invented the piano-key necktie!

01:19:00.694 --> 01:19:02.529
I invented it!

01:19:02.613 --> 01:19:05.365
What have you done, Derek?
Nothing!

01:19:05.491 --> 01:19:08.701
You've done nothing! Nothing!

01:19:09.203 --> 01:19:12.872
And I will be a monkey's uncle
if I have you ruin this for me!

01:19:12.957 --> 01:19:16.167
Because if you can't get
the job done, then I will!

01:19:16.794 --> 01:19:18.878
Die, you wage-hiking scum!

01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:24.551
One look?

01:19:25.636 --> 01:19:29.139
One look? I don't think so!

01:19:41.694 --> 01:19:43.153
There it is!

01:19:43.237 --> 01:19:44.362
Magnum!

01:19:45.448 --> 01:19:47.198
Holy moly.

01:19:47.324 --> 01:19:50.535
Yeah, baby! That's what
I've been waiting for!

01:19:50.911 --> 01:19:54.164
Dear God. It's beautiful.

01:20:08.137 --> 01:20:10.388
Yeah!

01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:20.148
That's my kid. That's my son.

01:20:23.152 --> 01:20:24.194
Yeah!

01:20:26.739 --> 01:20:27.739
Derek!

01:20:28.115 --> 01:20:32.285
I love that kid. Dumb as
a stump, but I love him.

01:20:32.369 --> 01:20:34.329
Derek, you did it!
That was amazing!

01:20:34.413 --> 01:20:36.581
I know. I turned left!

01:20:37.666 --> 01:20:38.791
Yeah, that too. But, Derek,

01:20:38.876 --> 01:20:40.919
you saved the prime
minister of Malaysia!

01:20:41.253 --> 01:20:43.505
Right. Cool.

01:20:44.256 --> 01:20:47.258
Thank you, Derek Zoolander,
for saving my life.

01:21:14.453 --> 01:21:18.164

supermodel Derek Zoolander.

01:21:18.249 --> 01:21:19.832

Other Stuff Good, Too,

everything they need to know to
learn to be a professional model

01:21:29.093 --> 01:21:31.386
and a professional human being.

01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:34.514

business management teacher,

01:21:34.598 --> 01:21:37.225

of every pair of underwear sold.

01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:45.900
What are you gonna do?

01:21:45.985 --> 01:21:49.112
Screw him! Hold out for more!

01:21:49.196 --> 01:21:51.573

01:21:51.657 --> 01:21:54.409

01:21:57.496 --> 01:21:58.913
we teach you that
there's more to life,

01:21:59.039 --> 01:22:01.708
than just being really,
really, really good-looking.

01:22:01.792 --> 01:22:03.626
- Right, kids?
- Right!

01:22:03.711 --> 01:22:04.961
And cut!

01:22:06.505 --> 01:22:09.173
- Looks great. I think we got it.
- All right, Mitch. Thanks.

01:22:09.258 --> 01:22:11.801
- All right, everybody! That's a wrap!
- Hey, Hansel.

01:22:11.885 --> 01:22:15.471
Hey, D-Rock, I'm gonna take these kids
over to the George Washington Bridge,

01:22:15.556 --> 01:22:17.515
give them a little
lesson in base jumping.

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:19.142
I'll catch you in the
teacher's lounge later on?

01:22:19.226 --> 01:22:20.268
All right.

01:22:20.352 --> 01:22:23.021
All right, guys. Last one to the
helicopter's a rotten egg. Let's go!

01:22:25.024 --> 01:22:26.149
Hey, Matilda!

01:22:26.233 --> 01:22:29.277
- There's Daddy! Hi.
- Hey.

01:22:29.695 --> 01:22:31.195
- How's Derek, Jr?
- He's great.

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:33.531
Guess what. He made
his first look today.

01:22:33.699 --> 01:22:34.741
Really?

01:22:34.825 --> 01:22:36.659
You wanna show Daddy
your look, Derek, Jr?

01:22:42.374 --> 01:22:43.374
Wow.

01:22:44.126 --> 01:22:47.503
- Wanna hang out for story hour?
