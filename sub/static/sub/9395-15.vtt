01:42.082 --> 01:45.428
Hey, easy there tough guy, you’ll pop a stitch.

01:45.479 --> 01:47.363
It’s just a drawer, Mom. I’m not helpless.

01:47.435 --> 01:49.559
You will be if you keep this up. What are you looking for?

01:49.636 --> 01:50.932
The book Keith dropped off.

01:56.471 --> 01:57.305
I don’t get it.

01:58.334 --> 02:00.838
You know, Dan does one decent thing and you cut him some slack.

02:00.967 --> 02:04.529
And yet Keith makes one mistake and you cut him out.

02:06.281 --> 02:07.449
How are we doing today?

02:07.620 --> 02:08.970
Like I had my spleen ripped out.

02:09.800 --> 02:11.739
You’ll be sore for a while.

02:12.368 --> 02:13.486
What about basketball?

02:14.340 --> 02:15.293
Will I get it back?

02:16.133 --> 02:17.050
The way it was?

02:18.528 --> 02:20.381
Your shoulder was pretty badly damaged.

02:20.453 --> 02:22.214
Full recovery may not be possible.

02:34.955 --> 02:36.685
- It’s him.
- Don’t pick up.

02:38.635 --> 02:42.163
Your father is refusing to cooperate with the attorneys.

02:42.226 --> 02:45.599
So, this custody thing may end up in front of a judge.

02:45.696 --> 02:48.845
If that happens, things could get ugly, sweetie.

02:48.922 --> 02:52.809
But I want you to know, I’m only trying to protect you.

02:55.220 --> 02:55.956
Nathan.

03:00.032 --> 03:02.265
How great is it that dad has an off button now?

03:03.954 --> 03:06.438
Look, Mom, I think you’re doing the right thing for yourself.

03:07.963 --> 03:10.841
- Even for him.
- It’s you I’m worried about, Honey.

03:10.892 --> 03:12.515
Well don’t. I get it.

03:13.345 --> 03:15.269
You and dad splitting up is a good thing.

03:18.669 --> 03:21.332
The nurse said you set a new VWU record.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.615
Visitors While Unconscious.

03:24.562 --> 03:28.658
You know, Whitey came to see you, and Deb, and the guys from the River Court.

03:30.296 --> 03:31.603
Anybody else from school?

03:32.586 --> 03:33.344
Peyton?

03:33.830 --> 03:37.261
Once. I saw her holding your hand and talking to you.

03:38.837 --> 03:40.142
And she never came back?

03:40.711 --> 03:42.405
I don’t think so, why?

03:43.927 --> 03:44.822
Surprise!

03:49.118 --> 03:50.260
Oh wow.

03:50.767 --> 03:51.498
What?

03:52.952 --> 03:53.930
Bad idea?

03:55.892 --> 03:59.835
No, no, you just surprised me.

04:00.284 --> 04:03.152
Then mission accomplished. I Fung Swayed your room.

04:03.336 --> 04:04.820
It promotes healing.

04:05.824 --> 04:08.058
I just wanted to say, Welcome Home, Boyfriend.

04:14.555 --> 04:16.029
Can we have a minute, Mom?

04:16.250 --> 04:19.301
Keep it short, you need to be in bed.

04:23.156 --> 04:26.439
Hey, I want you to know I’m here for you. Whatever you need.

04:26.930 --> 04:30.842
And if she’s not home, I might even give you a sponge bath.

04:31.262 --> 04:33.433
Actually, I can’t do that for a while.

04:33.494 --> 04:34.083
What?

04:35.060 --> 04:38.491
- Bathe?
- No. You know. Sex.

04:38.573 --> 04:41.537
Oh. That sucks.

04:41.887 --> 04:44.436
A little cardio might just be what you need though.

04:46.274 --> 04:47.185
What?

04:48.045 --> 04:50.606
I’m just going to need some time to figure some stuff out.

04:50.969 --> 04:53.872
Whatever you need, I’m here for you.

04:54.486 --> 04:57.958
Yeah, see that’s the thing.

05:04.952 --> 05:06.713
Are you breaking up with me?

05:07.326 --> 05:09.779
I just think it’s the best thing for right now.

05:15.821 --> 05:16.943
Maybe for you.

05:18.940 --> 05:21.377
Brooke, I’m sorry.

05:22.646 --> 05:24.443
Apparently not enough.

05:34.571 --> 05:37.470
Dan, Deb has made it more than clear that she intends to divorce you.

05:37.546 --> 05:38.432
Or murder me.

05:39.381 --> 05:41.401
Did she tell you she threatened to stab me in my sleep?

05:41.476 --> 05:43.050
It was a figure of speech.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.816
Your client’s trying to shut me out of my son’s life

05:44.867 --> 05:46.577
- and I won’t let that happen.
- Dan.

05:46.628 --> 05:48.806
And you know you can’t throw me out of the house without a court order.

05:48.857 --> 05:49.891
You already moved out.

05:49.956 --> 05:53.818
That’s because I was threatened with physical bodily harm. I did what I had to do to protect myself.

05:53.910 --> 05:58.063
And now that things have calmed down, I don’t know. Maybe I’ll move back in.

05:58.174 --> 06:03.002
I’ll get a restraining order. I’ll prove what an abusive son of a bitch you really are.

06:03.633 --> 06:06.371
The gloves are coming off, huh, Deb? Fine.

06:06.576 --> 06:09.137
See, you’re calling the shots here, I’m just following the lead.

06:14.308 --> 06:16.509
All that stuff from your past may have to come out, Deb.

06:16.540 --> 06:18.189
Do you really want to do that to Nathan?

06:18.225 --> 06:20.006
No, Deb the question is, do you?

06:31.777 --> 06:33.405
You have one message.

06:34.782 --> 06:37.374
Hey it’s me. Peyton. Where are you?

06:37.645 --> 06:39.703
I really want to see you. Give me a call.

07:23.690 --> 07:26.347
Lucas. Lucas?

07:27.322 --> 07:29.685
- What hurts the most?
- All of it.

07:31.186 --> 07:33.531
So you broke up with Brooke to be with Peyton?

07:34.339 --> 07:35.241
You think that’s wrong?

07:35.307 --> 07:37.990
Oh I’m not in any position to judge, I just...

07:39.558 --> 07:41.882
but the heart wants what it wants. Right?

07:42.978 --> 07:44.708
At least Brooke knows the truth now.

07:46.459 --> 07:49.255
Anyway, I should let you get some rest.

07:52.841 --> 07:54.374
- You look good.
- Thank you.

07:54.770 --> 07:57.667
By the way, you’re lucky you didn’t die cause I would have killed you.

07:58.927 --> 07:59.981
I love you too.

08:03.724 --> 08:04.538
Peyton?

08:04.944 --> 08:06.493
Hey, I’m going to go elsewhere

08:13.308 --> 08:15.264
I was so afraid you weren’t going to wake up.

08:15.341 --> 08:18.572
What? And miss out on being with you?

08:28.120 --> 08:30.098
When you never came to the hospital,

08:31.450 --> 08:35.899
I started to worry that maybe you changed your mind.

08:36.631 --> 08:41.078
No, it was just all too weird with Brooke there.

08:46.608 --> 08:49.663
I started to tell her about us, the night of you accident,

08:49.707 --> 08:51.861
but then Haley called and everything changed.

08:52.273 --> 08:53.173
I figured.

08:55.358 --> 08:57.402
That’s why I ended things with Brooke today.

08:58.241 --> 08:59.132
You did?

09:01.539 --> 09:02.630
Did you tell her why?

09:03.418 --> 09:05.829
I told her I needed to focus on getting well.

09:07.208 --> 09:08.743
Maybe I should tell her the rest.

09:09.597 --> 09:13.693
Sure, could you just give me a few days to straighten up? Okay?

09:14.861 --> 09:17.611
Then we’ll tell her together. Like we said.

09:17.791 --> 09:22.864
Besides, we’re not exactly going to be dating in the mean time, you know?

10:04.230 --> 10:06.798
Am I going to have to tie you to your bed to make you rest?

10:06.885 --> 10:07.714
I’m sorry.

10:10.273 --> 10:13.597
The next time you leave the house, I’ll be cashing in your life insurance.

10:21.806 --> 10:23.319
Want to tell me what’s going on?

10:24.939 --> 10:25.681
What do you mean?

10:26.587 --> 10:28.942
Brooke’s waiting for you when you get home from the hospital.

10:28.988 --> 10:31.030
Peyton’s there when I show up after work.

10:32.070 --> 10:34.886
What happened when I went to Italy? I thought you were interested in Peyton.

10:35.517 --> 10:36.565
I was.

10:38.174 --> 10:39.611
It just got too complicated.

10:40.821 --> 10:43.242
You know, I don’t know where she stood with me, and

10:44.368 --> 10:45.771
so I started dating Brooke.

10:46.391 --> 10:49.320
You know, when I first met Brooke I thought she was a little nutty.

10:50.996 --> 10:53.917
But the way she looked after you. She proved me wrong.

10:54.317 --> 10:56.770
She’s crazy about you and I think that’s a good thing.

10:56.856 --> 10:59.089
Actually I broke up with Brooke yesterday.

10:59.298 --> 11:00.825
What? Why?

11:00.938 --> 11:02.519
I’d rather not talk about it.

11:04.147 --> 11:04.854
Okay.

11:06.584 --> 11:08.495
But when you want to I’m here, alright?

11:15.111 --> 11:18.524
Peyton, what’s the matter?

11:22.773 --> 11:27.223
Peyton? I looked all over for you. You didn’t get my messages?

11:27.443 --> 11:31.258
Really? Oh no, my phone’s been whacked out all day.

11:31.811 --> 11:32.746
Are you okay?

11:33.615 --> 11:35.456
Not really, no.

11:37.181 --> 11:41.063
I said I wasn’t going to do this and I said that it wasn’t worth it but it is.

11:41.267 --> 11:42.982
Lucas broke up with me.

11:43.644 --> 11:44.754
I’m sorry.

11:44.841 --> 11:47.924
I was looking forward to getting a chance to show him how much he means to me

11:48.800 --> 11:51.389
and he said he just wants to be friends.

11:51.973 --> 11:54.994
And every idiot knows that that’s just code for go away.

11:55.577 --> 11:57.130
I don’t know what I’m supposed to do.

11:57.504 --> 11:59.956
Look, if Lucas said he wants to be friends, I’m sure he means it.

12:00.499 --> 12:02.331
How do you do that with Lucas?

12:04.349 --> 12:10.447
You just sort of do everything that you’ve been doing without the sex part.

12:13.470 --> 12:15.808
There’s a first time for everything, right?

12:22.008 --> 12:23.253
Wait a minute, is this…

12:23.963 --> 12:24.855
What?

12:26.037 --> 12:27.266
Is this a new outfit?

12:27.545 --> 12:31.772
He noticed. Yes, it is, it’s all part of the new me.

12:32.603 --> 12:33.441
Do you like?

12:34.065 --> 12:36.287
Yeah but what’s wrong with the old you?

12:36.564 --> 12:39.400
Nothing, I just thought I’d branch out into some new things.

12:40.211 --> 12:41.961
This could be good. Like what?

12:42.165 --> 12:44.833
I don’t know, there’s a lot of stuff I wanted to try that I never did.

12:44.884 --> 12:46.021
Like fooling around with me.

12:47.653 --> 12:49.052
Like snowboarding.

12:49.221 --> 12:50.885
Okay, well I can teach you how to do that too.

12:50.941 --> 12:52.523
Yeah? Cool.

12:52.615 --> 12:53.291
What else?

12:54.459 --> 12:56.220
- Singing.
- Do you sing?

12:57.019 --> 13:00.337
I, no, I mean I sing when no one’s around.

13:01.120 --> 13:03.024
Well, I think you should sing for me sometime.

13:03.394 --> 13:06.793
Okay, right yeah. I’ll catch you on the slopes.

13:11.613 --> 13:18.181
You know, I don’t know how I’d deal with all this crap with my parents if you weren’t around.

13:18.375 --> 13:19.184
Well you’re welcome.

13:19.445 --> 13:23.500
I’m serious. It’s like the worst things get with my parents.

13:23.644 --> 13:25.242
The better things get with you.

13:26.321 --> 13:28.098
Are things really awful with your parents?

13:28.189 --> 13:29.102
It’s a war zone.

13:30.274 --> 13:32.650
And I’m stuck with whoever’s got the best lawyer.

13:33.899 --> 13:35.985
Oh that’s… you should know your rights.

13:36.387 --> 13:39.670
- It’s not like I have any.
- No, you do, let’s find out.

13:40.272 --> 13:41.303
Knowledge is power.

13:49.556 --> 13:50.468
What’s that?

13:50.760 --> 13:53.145
This is a playstation 2.

13:55.157 --> 13:57.066
From the team. Even Nathan kicked in.

13:57.523 --> 14:01.348
We got you NBA Shoot Out, and NCAA Final 4.

14:01.690 --> 14:03.232
Keep you in the game till you get back.

14:03.314 --> 14:06.882
Yeah, well the doctor says I might not be back.

14:06.965 --> 14:10.302
Well don’t listen to them. I mean ultimately, that’s up to you, right?

14:10.440 --> 14:11.398
I guess so.

14:12.838 --> 14:16.759
Hey, so I had a… I had a question for you.

14:16.815 --> 14:19.032
Do you know if your mom’s hiring at the café?

14:19.094 --> 14:22.115
Because I have to get a part time job and I was thinking maybe…

14:22.212 --> 14:23.180
You want me to talk to her?

14:23.246 --> 14:25.857
You know if you wanted to put in a good word for me, that’s cool.

14:29.171 --> 14:30.414
You’re popular today, huh?

14:31.484 --> 14:32.231
Keith.

14:37.311 --> 14:38.897
- It’s good to see you.
- You too.

14:40.271 --> 14:41.266
Hey Jake.

14:41.990 --> 14:43.106
Glad to see you’re okay.

14:44.279 --> 14:47.996
Anyway, I got to head out so, hang in there, Luke.

14:48.124 --> 14:49.132
Tell the team thanks for me.

14:53.959 --> 14:55.000
So where’ve you been?

14:56.460 --> 14:59.792
I was just waiting for a chance when your mom wouldn’t be here.

15:02.845 --> 15:03.797
So how you doing?

15:04.482 --> 15:05.271
Alive.

15:07.601 --> 15:08.892
You look pretty banged up.

15:08.973 --> 15:10.126
I got off easy.

15:12.091 --> 15:16.944
Luke, I... I want you to know how sorry I am about what happened.

15:17.007 --> 15:18.927
I know that. Keith, come on.

15:18.983 --> 15:20.258
I should have had those beers.

15:20.848 --> 15:23.781
I just freaked out about your mom coming home.

15:24.643 --> 15:26.602
I just kept thinking, what if Italy changed her?

15:26.664 --> 15:32.061
What if after having that experience she doesn’t want to settle for a guy with permanent grease stains?

15:32.792 --> 15:34.358
It happened. Alright?

15:35.777 --> 15:38.798
- I know you weren’t drunk, so…
- Yeah, I wish your mom believed that.

15:38.855 --> 15:42.254
She’ll get over it. I’m working on her.

15:44.491 --> 15:49.114
So Dan actually saved me, huh?

15:49.243 --> 15:55.224
Yeah. I have to say most of the time he’s an ass but that night, he was definitely a hero.

15:56.790 --> 15:58.239
Where am I supposed to put that?

15:59.268 --> 16:00.788
Just be grateful, I guess.

16:06.313 --> 16:12.785
Hey. I was just leaving.

16:13.882 --> 16:14.797
I’ll see ya.

16:17.031 --> 16:18.826
- Mom.
- Get back in bed.

16:24.469 --> 16:28.611
Well, I can’t pay unless I make the repair and I cant’ make the repair unless you send me the part.

16:30.157 --> 16:33.214
Cash up front? Since when?

16:35.724 --> 16:37.739
Alright, fine, fine.

16:38.507 --> 16:39.358
Bye.

16:45.650 --> 16:47.335
Here’s the stuff you left at the house.

16:48.779 --> 16:50.043
You didn’t need to do that.

16:50.172 --> 16:53.356
And I’m going to pay you back. Every penny of Lucas’ medical bills.

16:53.418 --> 16:55.395
It may take me a while, but I’ll get the money to you.

16:55.589 --> 16:56.971
It wasn’t a loan, Karen.

16:57.053 --> 16:58.066
Yes it was.

16:58.307 --> 16:59.372
I made a mistake.

16:59.659 --> 17:03.530
Keith, I nearly lost my son because of that mistake.

17:04.825 --> 17:05.665
I’m sorry

17:07.071 --> 17:08.771
but I can’t change what happened.

17:10.569 --> 17:11.885
I wish I could.

17:25.575 --> 17:26.479
What the hell?

17:28.996 --> 17:29.832
What do you want?

17:30.318 --> 17:31.777
What’d you do? Change the locks?

17:32.002 --> 17:33.312
My attorney’s advice.

17:33.379 --> 17:35.545
That’s great, would you open the door please? We need to talk.

17:35.607 --> 17:36.948
Not going to happen, Dan.

17:37.316 --> 17:39.514
You have something to say, you say it to my lawyer.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.781
- Damn it, Deb, open the…
- What’s going on?

17:41.848 --> 17:44.735
Your mother’s on crack, she changed the locks on my house. Will you open the damn door?

17:44.795 --> 17:46.380
No! You have to leave.

17:46.753 --> 17:49.108
Fine. Come on, Nathan, I’ll buy you breakfast.

17:51.110 --> 17:53.332
- Nathan.
- Hey do you mind? I need to talk to my son.

17:53.409 --> 17:56.170
- Yes I do mind. I mean it, Dan.
- Okay, this is what I’m talking about,

17:56.226 --> 17:59.466
- it’s sad to see that the lady…
- Stop! Stop!

17:59.973 --> 18:02.709
You guys don’t get to decide who I live with, alright? I do.

18:02.769 --> 18:05.436
- What are you talking about?
- Look it up. It’s not your decision.

18:05.549 --> 18:07.725
All I have to do is take my case to the judge.

18:08.779 --> 18:11.354
And right now I don’t know if I want to live with either of you two.

18:15.293 --> 18:16.378
Okay.

18:23.289 --> 18:24.713
Hey, I really appreciate this, Ms. Roe.

18:24.918 --> 18:26.557
Oh please, call me Karen.

18:26.680 --> 18:29.890
And don’t worry about it. Lucas put in a good word for you.

18:33.705 --> 18:35.315
You got your first table.

18:49.014 --> 18:50.282
Everything okay, dad?

18:51.978 --> 18:55.910
You’re kidding, well I just started.

18:57.240 --> 18:57.830
No...

18:59.775 --> 19:02.776
Okay, no, I know.

19:04.071 --> 19:04.841
Yeah.

19:06.239 --> 19:09.402
Ms. Roe? I’m really sorry about this but I got to go.

19:09.672 --> 19:10.640
Is something wrong?

19:10.702 --> 19:13.968
Well, my dad just got called into work so there’s no one to watch Jenny.

19:14.034 --> 19:14.946
Is that your sister?

19:15.852 --> 19:17.368
That’s my daughter.

19:17.978 --> 19:19.272
Lucas didn’t tell you?

19:19.809 --> 19:21.438
Apparently not.

19:21.638 --> 19:27.429
- I’m really sorry to do this but I…
- No it’s okay. Just give me a call.

19:27.926 --> 19:28.785
Okay.

19:42.461 --> 19:45.079
Where’ve you been? I’m going nuts!

19:47.704 --> 19:50.212
Sorry. Got a strip due.

20:00.042 --> 20:02.985
You could work on it here. I love to watch you draw.

20:09.108 --> 20:10.989
All my stuff is here.

20:15.737 --> 20:17.775
C’mon…. I miss you!

20:27.121 --> 20:29.366
I can’t. Sorry. Gotta go.

20:45.223 --> 20:46.062
Come in.

20:47.882 --> 20:48.751
Hi.

20:49.025 --> 20:51.510
Oh, Brooke. Hi.

20:52.370 --> 20:53.983
Lucas told you we broke up?

20:54.367 --> 20:55.519
Actually, yeah.

20:56.472 --> 21:00.917
Okay. I know he said he needed some space but I was on the internet

21:00.958 --> 21:05.212
and I found this website about Splenectomies and it recommended this herbal tea so,

21:05.458 --> 21:07.035
I picked some up for Lucas.

21:07.628 --> 21:08.939
That was very sweet of you.

21:10.127 --> 21:13.942
He’s asleep right now but I’ll brew him a cup when he wakes up.

21:16.061 --> 21:17.552
Will you tell him I said hi?

21:19.481 --> 21:20.302
Yeah.

21:23.547 --> 21:24.658
What is all this?

21:24.949 --> 21:28.267
Oh, I was putting together a scrapbook from my trip. You want to see?

21:28.861 --> 21:29.567
Great.

21:30.536 --> 21:34.546
I am sorry to put you through this, the divorce I mean.

21:35.277 --> 21:36.618
It’s a little late for that, Mom.

21:37.468 --> 21:40.259
And I know I wasn’t always there for you.

21:41.324 --> 21:45.061
I guess it was easier to avoid going head to head with your father.

21:45.286 --> 21:47.555
And I’m sorry you had to pay the price for that.

21:48.476 --> 21:49.326
Yeah.

21:49.577 --> 21:50.980
Can you tell me where you’re at?

21:51.441 --> 21:53.483
I’m kind of tired of all the lying and the fighting.

21:54.866 --> 21:56.545
I’m feeling like I’m caught in the middle of it all.

21:56.633 --> 21:59.715
That will end. As soon as the divorce is final.

21:59.890 --> 22:00.724
I just...

22:06.340 --> 22:08.617
I want you to stay with me, Nate.

22:09.999 --> 22:11.563
Things are going to change?

22:11.834 --> 22:13.119
I promise you.

22:16.160 --> 22:17.052
Okay.

22:21.977 --> 22:23.257
I love you, Nathan.

22:23.744 --> 22:26.524
Yeah. You too.

22:33.272 --> 22:36.181
So did you ever actually do any cooking while you were there?

22:36.487 --> 22:39.231
Are you kidding? It was culinary boot camp.

22:39.974 --> 22:42.001
But we had our Sunday’s free.

22:42.508 --> 22:45.529
So it was all about fitting the entire country into 6 days.

22:46.870 --> 22:48.340
Where was this one taken?

22:48.416 --> 22:50.757
Oh that’s Piazza of San Marco in Venice.

22:51.693 --> 22:53.111
It was so beautiful.

22:54.525 --> 22:56.706
I’d love to go there someday.

22:58.324 --> 23:00.863
I don’t even know how to describe it, Brooke.

23:02.287 --> 23:05.093
I got to be an entirely different person for a little while.

23:06.705 --> 23:08.508
I almost didn’t want to come back.

23:08.631 --> 23:09.384
Yeah.

23:10.817 --> 23:14.042
When things are really special it makes it that much harder to let go.

23:14.363 --> 23:17.114
Lucas is going through a pretty tough time right now.

23:17.426 --> 23:18.274
I know.

23:18.905 --> 23:22.332
I’m hoping that maybe when he feels better he’ll take another chance on me.

23:53.601 --> 23:55.592
- Lucas, what are you…
- I wanted to see you.

23:55.628 --> 23:59.258
The doctor said you shouldn’t be out. What are you crazy?

23:59.452 --> 24:00.266
Probably.

24:02.402 --> 24:04.730
I just had to get out of there, you know?

24:10.195 --> 24:11.720
I can’t get you out of my head.

24:13.204 --> 24:16.692
I wish we could just fast forward these next 6 months.

24:19.189 --> 24:21.018
This messed up thing with Brooke.

24:23.456 --> 24:25.083
So we could just be together.

24:27.873 --> 24:28.975
What’s going on, Peyton?

24:29.973 --> 24:33.506
You sign off fast and… Ah...

24:34.634 --> 24:36.444
What? Are you okay?

24:36.689 --> 24:37.730
Can I just lay down?

24:40.622 --> 24:44.299
Lucas. Oh my God, you’re burning up.

24:47.348 --> 24:48.317
What are you doing?

24:49.128 --> 24:51.481
- I’m calling your mom.
- She’s with Brooke.

24:55.204 --> 24:56.933
Well, I should go check on Lucas.

24:57.301 --> 24:58.333
Will you let me?

24:58.506 --> 24:59.335
Yeah.

25:02.554 --> 25:03.387
Lucas?

25:08.383 --> 25:09.130
Hello?

25:09.986 --> 25:10.774
Peyton.

25:11.896 --> 25:12.797
What?!

25:13.468 --> 25:15.946
Can you get him to the emergency room, I’ll meet you there.

25:16.017 --> 25:19.698
Brooke. It’s Lucas. I got to go.

25:19.769 --> 25:20.841
Yeah, I’m coming with you.

25:32.839 --> 25:34.929
Hey. You’re back.

25:36.117 --> 25:37.392
How long was I out?

25:37.563 --> 25:38.693
Just a couple of minutes.

25:39.952 --> 25:43.049
- Luke, what are we going to do?
- My God Lucas, are you alright?

25:45.295 --> 25:46.680
Yeah, I think so.

25:46.976 --> 25:49.055
The doctor said his fever’s going down.

25:49.275 --> 25:50.249
Where were you?

25:51.000 --> 25:51.778
Peyton?

25:53.815 --> 25:55.844
I was down at the river court.

25:57.428 --> 26:00.084
I know I shouldn’t have but I had to get out.

26:02.018 --> 26:03.831
I guess I over did it.

26:05.070 --> 26:07.733
I started feeling pretty bad and Peyton drove by.

26:09.571 --> 26:12.193
So now that you guys are here I should probably go.

26:12.383 --> 26:13.320
Thank you, Peyton.

26:13.601 --> 26:16.159
Sure. I’ll see you guys later.

26:20.124 --> 26:23.533
- I’m sorry.
- Yeah, you should be. Honestly, Lucas…

26:23.590 --> 26:27.707
Mom, just wait and not yell at me now. Until we get home.

26:27.901 --> 26:29.632
- You going to be okay?
- Yeah.

26:41.718 --> 26:42.837
You want a drink?

26:45.135 --> 26:46.581
Since when do you let me drink?

26:47.557 --> 26:50.557
- You’re old enough.
- Look, Dad...

26:50.604 --> 26:52.493
I know things haven’t been easy on you lately.

26:52.970 --> 26:58.678
To be honest, when you told us that it’s you who gets to choose who you’re staying with,

26:59.072 --> 27:00.880
- I was relieved.
- You were?

27:01.044 --> 27:05.610
Absolutely. Cause you’re a smart kid. And you know what’s best for you, right?

27:06.461 --> 27:09.631
Yeah, yeah and that’s why I came…

27:09.681 --> 27:11.371
You know I’ve been there for you your whole life.

27:11.790 --> 27:13.804
And I admit, sometimes too much.

27:15.056 --> 27:19.102
But, it’s only because I care about you.

27:20.024 --> 27:23.459
And I’ve been trying to pick up the slack for your mom whose been focused on her work all these years.

27:25.742 --> 27:27.440
I wish she wouldn’t go through with this.

27:28.544 --> 27:31.272
But she’s doing what she feels she has to do.

27:32.081 --> 27:34.570
- So I’m just going to have to do the same.
- Meaning what?

27:35.134 --> 27:37.718
I’m going to have to make some tough choices where she’s concerned.

27:38.816 --> 27:42.684
But you should know, this is all in service of you.

27:42.737 --> 27:44.102
What are you planning on doing, Dad?

27:45.803 --> 27:49.091
She’s trying to steal you away from me, Nate. So I’m going to fight her.

27:49.617 --> 27:51.759
By making things as difficult for her as I can.

27:52.684 --> 27:55.684
And the sad part is, and you know how lawyers work,

27:55.986 --> 27:57.809
they’re going to make her out to be an unfit mother.

27:57.953 --> 28:02.028
By using all the time she was absent against her. And there’s other stuff as well.

28:02.151 --> 28:05.045
- What other stuff?
- Anything they can find out about her.

28:05.874 --> 28:09.474
- Like what, Dad?
- Come stay with me, Nate.

28:09.965 --> 28:13.108
I’ll back off and let this divorce go through as quickly as possible.

28:13.262 --> 28:16.176
You’d be better off with me. You’d be doing your mother a favor as well.

28:16.784 --> 28:19.314
Dad look, I just want to know what you’re talking about.

28:19.673 --> 28:20.988
What other stuff with mom?

28:22.440 --> 28:24.357
Go live with her and find out.

28:29.256 --> 28:30.153
Sit down.

28:38.730 --> 28:42.083
Now, tell me why you and Peyton were really together.

28:42.555 --> 28:45.385
- I told you.
- Lucas, you’re lying to me.

28:45.474 --> 28:48.006
And you wouldn’t be unless you’re doing something you’re not proud of.

28:49.502 --> 28:51.177
I went to see Peyton.

28:53.286 --> 28:56.013
- We want to be together.
- Behind Brookes back?

28:56.076 --> 28:57.068
I broke up with Brooke.

28:57.125 --> 28:59.266
But apparently you didn’t tell her about Peyton.

28:59.743 --> 29:02.471
And that’s a shabby way to treat someone who’s really been there for you.

29:03.690 --> 29:05.410
Kind of like the way you’re treating Keith.

29:05.472 --> 29:06.823
Don’t change the subject.

29:06.889 --> 29:09.158
Mom I heard you talking to Brooke, about Italy.

29:10.172 --> 29:13.285
You know, I know you had this great time. It was amazing.

29:13.333 --> 29:15.840
But you know what I think you’re blaming Keith for taking that away from you.

29:15.917 --> 29:19.239
- I blame Keith for nearly killing you.
- No you weren’t there, Mom!

29:20.120 --> 29:22.314
You don’t know how excited he was to see that you were coming home.

29:22.391 --> 29:23.028
Lucas.

29:23.095 --> 29:28.645
No, he had a couple of beers because he was nervous about you coming back the way you guys left things.

29:31.169 --> 29:32.438
He wasn’t drunk.

29:33.816 --> 29:37.179
Why are you pushing somebody out of your life who really and truly cares about you?

29:38.487 --> 29:39.837
Why are you?

29:50.394 --> 29:52.073
That doesn’t look like a yes face.

29:52.878 --> 29:57.871
I’m sorry Mr. Scott, your account history is working against your loan application.

29:57.998 --> 29:58.971
What does that mean?

29:59.166 --> 30:04.449
Well, given your average monthly income and what your new mortgage payment would be,

30:05.049 --> 30:06.820
it’s not a very reassuring picture.

30:06.866 --> 30:11.131
Well look, business is good. I mean, you know, it’s…

30:11.212 --> 30:15.236
We’re also concerned that withdrew virtually all of your savings.

30:15.437 --> 30:17.096
That’s usually a sign of trouble.

30:18.628 --> 30:21.786
Look, my nephew nearly died in a car accident.

30:22.487 --> 30:24.545
I paid the medical bills, I just…

30:25.610 --> 30:27.214
I wish I could help you.

30:33.583 --> 30:34.341
Hey.

30:34.940 --> 30:37.244
Hey sweetie. I’m glad you brought Jenny.

30:37.321 --> 30:38.012
Yeah.

30:40.241 --> 30:43.383
Hey Ms. Roe. Can I talk to you for a sec?

30:43.459 --> 30:44.735
It’s Karen, remember?

30:45.436 --> 30:46.735
Oh, she’s beautiful.

30:47.828 --> 30:48.925
What’s up?

30:49.567 --> 30:54.093
Well look, I’m really sorry about this but I don’t think this is going to work out.

30:54.145 --> 30:57.950
Because now my mom, she’s got the flu, and you know she can’t watch Jenny

30:57.996 --> 30:59.976
and I can’t keep flaking out on you like this.

31:00.048 --> 31:02.157
It’s okay, Jake, I understand.

31:03.514 --> 31:04.810
Come here, I want to show you something.

31:15.739 --> 31:17.108
This was Lucas’.

31:17.463 --> 31:21.906
And I can’t throw anything away so, when you need to bring Jenny, it’s fine.

31:22.827 --> 31:23.913
You’d let me do that?

31:25.044 --> 31:27.732
I wasn’t much older than you when I had Lucas.

31:27.799 --> 31:29.979
I know how hard it is to ask for help.

31:30.543 --> 31:35.264
But sometimes it’s okay to have someone give you a hand.

31:36.431 --> 31:37.564
I don’t know what to say.

31:38.004 --> 31:41.152
Say thank you, and get to work.

31:51.526 --> 31:53.072
You were out late last night.

31:54.214 --> 31:55.759
There was some stuff I had to take care of.

31:55.831 --> 31:57.510
Try to remember to call, honey.

31:58.341 --> 31:59.389
What’s that?

31:59.493 --> 32:04.356
Look, mom, you and I both know that no matter what we do, no matter what happens,

32:04.828 --> 32:08.760
dad’s not going to let up until he wins. It’s just the way he’s wired.

32:09.948 --> 32:12.544
So I’m going to save us all one huge headache.

32:12.646 --> 32:14.991
Nathan, what did he say to you? What did he do?

32:15.354 --> 32:18.159
No mom, apparently the question is what did you do?

32:19.441 --> 32:23.398
If your father is threatening you, you have to tell me the truth.

32:23.459 --> 32:25.461
Why am I the only one who has to tell the truth around here?

32:25.532 --> 32:27.110
Nathan, what did he say?

32:27.513 --> 32:30.402
He told me that there’s some things that you don’t want people to know about you.

32:31.483 --> 32:33.438
And that he’d use it against you in court.

32:36.046 --> 32:37.822
Maybe you can tell me he’s bluffing.

32:40.375 --> 32:43.361
I made some mistakes in the past.

32:43.463 --> 32:46.341
- What kind of mistakes?
- The kind that should stay in the past.

32:46.776 --> 32:51.911
None of it had anything to do with you or how much I love you, Nathan, you have to trust me.

32:53.043 --> 32:54.287
I already tried that.

32:55.839 --> 32:58.158
I’ll be back later to get the rest of my stuff.

32:58.240 --> 33:02.075
- Nathan please, listen to me.
- You want to keep your secrets, Mom? Fine.

33:03.078 --> 33:04.384
I’m gonna help you do that.

33:36.145 --> 33:38.879
Keith, you got a minute?

33:45.500 --> 33:47.567
I don’t want to dance around this.

33:47.742 --> 33:49.350
- Dance around what?
- Us.

33:50.400 --> 33:51.766
Where we’re at now.

33:53.563 --> 33:57.520
I left you with the most important thing in my life and you let me down

33:58.426 --> 34:00.947
at a time when I really thought we had something.

34:02.083 --> 34:02.954
We do.

34:05.218 --> 34:07.286
Those 6 weeks were amazing to me.

34:07.469 --> 34:09.969
For once I felt like I was in Lucas’ life in a real way.

34:10.054 --> 34:11.627
I mean you have to know how much that meant to me.

34:11.694 --> 34:15.277
- I don’t doubt that, but...
- I know. It doesn’t change what happened, right?

34:19.141 --> 34:20.664
I wasn’t drunk, Karen.

34:21.822 --> 34:22.911
I know that.

34:24.514 --> 34:26.306
But that’s not what this is about.

34:28.384 --> 34:29.710
Well, I want you to know,

34:30.512 --> 34:31.579
one of these days,

34:32.656 --> 34:35.362
you’re going to look at me and you’re going to see the person you used to see.

34:36.587 --> 34:38.451
Where does that leave us now?

34:39.480 --> 34:40.704
I guess it doesn’t.

34:54.284 --> 34:55.291
How you feeling?

34:56.331 --> 34:57.507
Okay, I guess.

34:59.520 --> 35:02.694
And not so okay.

35:04.182 --> 35:05.136
Me too.

35:21.151 --> 35:22.243
- Lucas.
- Peyton.

35:26.722 --> 35:30.925
When I saw you lying there in the hospital right after the accident

35:31.857 --> 35:36.815
all I could think about was how my mom wasn’t was luck as you.

35:37.930 --> 35:40.602
And then I remembered, after she died,

35:41.351 --> 35:44.463
it was Brooke who was there for me.

35:45.501 --> 35:49.948
We were just little kids and she would come over, every single day,

35:50.213 --> 35:51.641
to make sure I was okay.

35:53.327 --> 35:55.456
She’s been my best friend ever since.

36:00.642 --> 36:02.333
Well life’s short, Peyton.

36:03.397 --> 36:06.107
Too short to live it as a bad person.

36:08.108 --> 36:09.931
I cant betray her, Lucas.

36:10.755 --> 36:12.795
You mean even more than we already have.

36:17.633 --> 36:18.737
Peyton.

36:21.312 --> 36:22.387
I’m sorry.

36:24.866 --> 36:25.808
Me too.

36:30.078 --> 36:31.671
But it‘s better this way, right?

36:32.151 --> 36:32.853
Yeah.

36:53.036 --> 36:54.480
- Hey.
- Hey, you’re still here.

36:54.593 --> 36:55.663
How are you?

36:57.219 --> 36:59.964
I’m always here. Are you okay?

37:00.026 --> 37:03.050
Whatever I said last time you asked me that question probably still applies.

37:04.106 --> 37:06.784
Want to get some coffee? There’s some left if you want to talk about it.

37:06.860 --> 37:09.246
Actually, I’m kind of tired of talking about it.

37:09.339 --> 37:10.210
Oh, okay.

37:10.911 --> 37:13.492
Well, if there’s anything I can do to help, let me know.

37:14.936 --> 37:19.284
Well, I was thinking about what you said, about living in the moment.

37:19.593 --> 37:22.425
Well, I realized, that if I’m going to live in the moment,

37:22.988 --> 37:25.220
then I just want to live in it with you.

37:36.303 --> 37:39.138
So were you serious? About doing something for me?

37:40.003 --> 37:42.511
Well, that depends. What is it?

37:44.349 --> 37:46.710
- Nathan… no.
- Here’s your chance.

37:47.022 --> 37:51.936
Come on, you said you do anything to help me and this would really help me take my mind off things.

37:53.823 --> 37:56.607
- You asked for it.
- Yeah, I did.

38:08.829 --> 38:12.004
I love the time and in between

38:13.467 --> 38:15.214
the calm inside me

38:15.270 --> 38:18.895
in the space where I can breathe

38:19.483 --> 38:22.003
I believe there is a

38:22.049 --> 38:25.110
distance I have wandered

38:25.326 --> 38:28.362
to touch upon the years of

38:28.774 --> 38:34.418
reaching out and reaching in

38:34.486 --> 38:40.481
holding out holding in

38:42.279 --> 38:45.049
I believe

38:45.271 --> 38:51.673
this is heaven to no one else but me

38:52.113 --> 38:58.166
and I'll defend it long as I can be

38:58.243 --> 39:03.149
left here to linger in silence

39:03.666 --> 39:06.399
if I choose to

39:07.255 --> 39:12.942
would you try to understand

39:15.252 --> 39:21.575
Oh the quiet child awaits the day when she can break free

39:21.852 --> 39:26.880
the mold that clings like desperation

39:27.237 --> 39:30.530
Mother don’t you see I've got

39:30.664 --> 39:37.459
to live my life the way I feel is right for me

39:37.570 --> 39:45.686
say it’s not right for you but it's right for me

39:47.392 --> 39:50.483
I believe

39:50.590 --> 39:56.868
this is heaven to no one else but me

39:57.038 --> 40:00.523
and I'll defend it as long as

40:00.679 --> 40:07.873
I can be left here to linger in silence

40:08.440 --> 40:11.169
if I choose to

40:12.116 --> 40:17.235
would you try to understand

40:17.277 --> 40:18.192
Hey.

40:19.642 --> 40:20.799
You’re out late.

40:22.099 --> 40:24.665
Lucky thing you finding Lucas like that.

40:26.887 --> 40:29.283
If you didn’t come along, who knows what might have happened.

40:30.912 --> 40:32.436
Everything turned out okay.

40:33.850 --> 40:35.350
No, not really.

40:37.577 --> 40:42.507
I don’t know what hurts worse, you and Lucas sneaking around behind my back

40:42.565 --> 40:44.864
or you lying about it to my face.

40:46.543 --> 40:47.940
- Brooke.
- No.

40:48.636 --> 40:52.758
The next time you want to steal my boyfriend, you might want to turn that thing off.

40:54.572 --> 40:59.287
I went into his room to check on him and his computer was on.

41:01.093 --> 41:02.851
I know you two were together.

41:05.307 --> 41:07.801
He meant everything to me, Peyton.

41:08.867 --> 41:12.219
And I was ready to try and be his friend if that’s what he needed.

41:19.147 --> 41:22.332
And now I don’t really care if I see either one of you again.
