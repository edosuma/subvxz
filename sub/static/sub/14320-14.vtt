NARRATOR:
Previously onX-Men...

00:03.250 --> 00:05.750
Your destiny is
at its end, X-Men.

00:05.750 --> 00:10.875
The Dark Phoenix has
come to destroy you all!

00:11.583 --> 00:15.583
That thing, whatever it is,
just destroyed an entire
star system.

00:16.250 --> 00:19.583
We must
destroy that creature
before it feeds again.

00:19.583 --> 00:23.333
LILANDRA:
Gladiator, assemble the
Imperial Guard immediately

00:23.333 --> 00:25.458
and make ready the
Imperial Star Cruiser!

00:25.458 --> 00:27.291
What has happened,
my Empress?

00:27.291 --> 00:29.416
Our worst nightmare.

00:29.416 --> 00:32.208
I won't allow you
to enter my...

00:32.208 --> 00:33.500
(JEAN SCREAMING)

00:34.333 --> 00:38.583
Jean. Help me.
Help me. Help me.

00:38.583 --> 00:43.125
This can't be! No!

00:43.125 --> 00:45.833
The Phoenix is contained,
for now.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.125
Lilandra!

00:48.125 --> 00:51.583
It is the decision
of the High Council
of the Shi'ar Empire,

00:51.583 --> 00:55.208
that the being known both
as the Phoenix and as
Jean Grey,

00:55.208 --> 00:57.125
must be destroyed!

00:58.250 --> 00:59.250
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

01:58.708 --> 02:00.333
Capture Jean Grey!

02:00.333 --> 02:02.125
Don't let them through!

02:02.125 --> 02:03.750
You got that right!

02:03.750 --> 02:05.458
LILANDRA:
Do not resist, X-Men!

02:09.583 --> 02:10.708
No!

(SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE)

02:13.000 --> 02:15.166
(LILANDRA
SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE)

02:15.166 --> 02:17.583
They stopped! Why?

02:17.583 --> 02:20.375
Maybe they want to
live a little longer.

02:20.375 --> 02:22.583
I have probed
Lilandra's mind.

02:22.583 --> 02:24.583
The Shi'ar
have an ancient law,

02:24.583 --> 02:28.958
the challenge
to a duel of honor
which cannot be refused.

02:28.958 --> 02:31.583
I have made the challenge
in our names.

02:31.583 --> 02:34.000
In all of our names?

02:34.000 --> 02:37.583
It is the only way
to save Jean's life.

02:37.583 --> 02:39.875
So let's get to it.

02:39.875 --> 02:40.958
(SPEAKING ALIEN LANGUAGE)

02:53.875 --> 02:56.333
What happened?

02:56.333 --> 03:00.750
I believe that the technology
involves molecular dispersal
and reconstitution.

03:00.750 --> 03:03.083
In the vernacular,
we were moved.

03:03.083 --> 03:07.125
CYCLOPS: Lilandra, the
X-Men were your friends,
why have you kidnapped us?

03:07.125 --> 03:12.333
You are my friends.
I owe you my life
and my throne.

03:12.333 --> 03:15.208
CYCLOPS:
Then why not trust
us to deal with Jean?

03:15.208 --> 03:17.958
LILANDRA:
The Phoenix
is too powerful.

03:17.958 --> 03:22.416
Once, she existed
only to serve our
empire.

03:22.416 --> 03:26.958
Now she lives only to
experience new sensations.

03:26.958 --> 03:30.333
The planets were,
fortunately, uninhabited.

03:30.333 --> 03:35.875
But what of next time?
Soon single stars will
not satiate her.

03:35.875 --> 03:38.375
She will consume galaxies.

03:38.375 --> 03:43.583
Like the
crystal that spawned her,
she can destroy all that is!

03:43.583 --> 03:45.833
I have no choice.

03:46.416 --> 03:49.375
But Professor Xavier
has cured her!

03:49.375 --> 03:53.875
Scott, the Phoenix
may be under control,
but she is still within me.

03:53.875 --> 03:58.291
To kill
an innocent creature to
get at another is barbarous!

03:58.291 --> 04:03.958
Lilandra,
I have invoked the
challenge of "Arin'nn Haelar!"

04:03.958 --> 04:05.750
You cannot refuse it!

04:05.750 --> 04:08.958
Take no solace
in your cleverness.

04:08.958 --> 04:12.458
You have only compounded
the tragedy.

04:12.458 --> 04:15.708
The Shi'ar empire
does not act alone,

04:16.333 --> 04:19.500
Phoenix is a creature
of such immense power,

04:19.500 --> 04:21.875
that
she threatens
stellar empires

04:21.875 --> 04:25.208
that were ancient
before your sun
had planets.

04:25.708 --> 04:28.750
I must consult them.

04:28.750 --> 04:32.166
Earthers
are a stubborn
breed, but honorable.

04:32.166 --> 04:34.416
The Kree do not
object to this duel!

04:34.416 --> 04:38.125
Nor do I,
Empress of the Skrulls,

04:38.125 --> 04:43.125
provided the X-Men
are not permitted
to win!

04:43.125 --> 04:46.166
You'll have your duel,
Charles Xavier.

04:46.166 --> 04:50.625
Though I fear
you will live to regret
what you have done this day.

04:53.458 --> 04:56.833
Beast, there is a question
I must ask of you.

04:56.833 --> 04:59.333
You wonder
if we are on
the right side.

04:59.333 --> 05:02.458
She is someone I love,
as I would love a sister.

05:02.458 --> 05:06.458
Of course,
but there is far
more at stake here, Ororo.

05:06.458 --> 05:10.291
Jean has
committed no crime,
has injured no one.

05:10.291 --> 05:12.958
Yet, we are asked
to allow her to
be destroyed

05:12.958 --> 05:15.250
to prevent the possible
future crimes of another.

05:15.250 --> 05:18.458
But she has given
Jean a trial by combat.

05:18.458 --> 05:22.875
Such a trial is no
contest of reason,
it is a war.

05:22.875 --> 05:26.458
Such a position
mocks justice.
Lilandra is wrong.

05:26.458 --> 05:28.875
WOLVERINE: You're
getting slow, gumbo!

05:30.458 --> 05:32.000
GAMBIT: Gambit will be ready.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.583
Could Lilandra be right?

05:35.583 --> 05:37.583
Is Phoenix too
dangerous to exist?

05:37.583 --> 05:38.875
Maybe,

05:40.166 --> 05:45.708
but if push comes to shove
I stand by Jean all the way.

05:46.458 --> 05:51.708
XAVIER, TELEPATHICALLY:
Lilandra, let our minds
join as one.

05:54.458 --> 05:58.875
We must not
let these events
wither our love, Lilandra.

05:58.875 --> 06:02.458
LILANDRA:
I wish only to
cherish you, Charles.

06:02.458 --> 06:07.416
Then help me.
Join with me to
contain the Phoenix.

06:08.708 --> 06:11.000
That was unworthy of you.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.875
Lilandra,
you do not understand...

06:14.875 --> 06:18.458
I am Empress of
the Shi'ar Empire.

06:18.458 --> 06:21.958
My duty, before
the longings of
my heart,

06:21.958 --> 06:25.458
is to
protect those
in my dominion!

06:25.458 --> 06:30.500
Please, Lilandra,
it doesn't have
to be... No!

06:39.375 --> 06:42.708
I can't
help thinking, Rogue,
what if Lilandra's right?

06:42.708 --> 06:46.500
If the psychic
circuit breakers Xavier
placed in Jean's mind fail,

06:46.500 --> 06:50.416
a universe full of innocent
life would be at the
Phoenix's mercy.

06:50.416 --> 06:53.166
I know
how much you love Jean.

06:53.166 --> 06:58.000
It's the kind of love I've
always wanted in my life,
but never had.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.333
This must be
tearing you apart.

07:00.333 --> 07:02.583
I know
what you're
asking yourself.

07:02.583 --> 07:06.583
If I were
in Lilandra's place,
would I act any differently?

07:06.583 --> 07:09.208
I'd like to think, I would.

07:09.208 --> 07:11.458
No matter what the cost?

07:11.458 --> 07:14.125
You're wearing
your old X-Men
uniform.

07:14.125 --> 07:18.000
It is how you first
knew me. It felt right.

07:19.291 --> 07:21.000
My daddy always said,

07:21.000 --> 07:23.583
"Two's company,
and three's an
eavesdropper."

07:24.583 --> 07:26.000
Jean...

07:27.000 --> 07:30.583
I destroyed
a solar system
and reveled in it.

07:30.583 --> 07:32.625
Phoenix did! Not you.

07:32.625 --> 07:35.958
What if she breaks free?
What if...

07:35.958 --> 07:40.208
What if the next
world we ravage
is Earth?

07:40.208 --> 07:43.333
Jean, you're not evil.
You can win.

07:43.333 --> 07:45.083
We can stop Phoenix!

07:45.083 --> 07:48.833
No, Scott,
before you say any more,

07:50.625 --> 07:55.291
see my fears
and then give
me your answer.

07:55.291 --> 07:58.708
I can imagine
losing control again.

07:58.708 --> 08:02.291
Only this time, my victims
would be my friends.

08:13.458 --> 08:15.875
And the world
that I call home.

08:17.583 --> 08:20.291
Am I worth the risk?

08:20.291 --> 08:22.875
You're worth
everything there is.

08:23.625 --> 08:27.208
I love you, too, Scott.
With all my heart.

08:29.583 --> 08:32.583
The X-Men
will battle
the Imperial Guard

08:32.583 --> 08:35.750
in the uncharted blue
area of Earth's moon.

08:35.750 --> 08:40.500
If the X-Men win,
those who survive
will be set free.

08:40.500 --> 08:43.125
If my
Imperial Guard wins,

08:43.125 --> 08:48.583
Phoenix, Jean Grey,
is ours to do with
as we will.

08:50.250 --> 08:52.458
Technician,
beam them down.

08:57.083 --> 09:00.458
The X-Men face hopeless odds,
Your Majestrix.

09:00.458 --> 09:04.375
But they're exceptional
beings. Suppose they win?

09:04.375 --> 09:09.625
They will not win, Araki.
They cannot win.

09:14.708 --> 09:17.750
Looks like some
spooky Mardi Gras.

09:17.750 --> 09:19.375
Fascinating!

09:19.375 --> 09:22.625
These ruins mean the
moon was once inhabited!

09:22.625 --> 09:26.500
I can fly and we
can all breathe.

09:26.500 --> 09:30.625
Wait! I'm picking up
multiple telepathic
impressions.

09:30.625 --> 09:32.208
Over there.

09:37.583 --> 09:39.625
Looks like
it's show time.

09:39.625 --> 09:41.583
Remember the plan,

09:41.583 --> 09:43.833
we split up into teams
and start hitting and
running

09:43.833 --> 09:45.583
until we whittle them down!

09:45.583 --> 09:48.583
STARBOLT: You can
neither hide nor
escape from us!

09:48.583 --> 09:50.708
Guess again, hot shot!

09:59.375 --> 10:00.583
(SCREAMS)

10:05.375 --> 10:06.875
GAMBIT: The party's
started without us!

10:07.333 --> 10:13.250
Oh, dear, we have met
the enemy, and he is big.

10:13.250 --> 10:16.708
We offer you the choice
of honorable surrender.

10:16.708 --> 10:19.250
Stuff your offer, tin man!

10:20.500 --> 10:22.750
Where'd you come from?

10:25.458 --> 10:26.708
Gambit!

10:28.750 --> 10:31.250
Gambit is much obliged,
my brave belle.

10:31.250 --> 10:33.375
I look forward to
making it up to you.

10:33.583 --> 10:35.708
EARTHQUAKE: Nice try!

10:35.708 --> 10:41.291
But you can't
fight a man who controls
the ground under your feet.

10:42.166 --> 10:47.333
Controlling
the dirt is nothing to one
who commands wind and rain!

10:48.333 --> 10:49.333
(SCREAMS)

10:56.000 --> 10:59.333
First round to the
Imperial Guard,
Hussar.

10:59.333 --> 11:00.583
A good omen!

11:00.583 --> 11:02.500
You have angered Starbolt!

11:02.500 --> 11:05.458
My rage is feared
throughout the empire!

11:09.458 --> 11:11.708
Honey,
you're giving
me goose bumps!

11:16.625 --> 11:19.208
If you want me,
you got to catch me first.

11:19.208 --> 11:22.708
You're fast as a swamp bug
on a hot skillet!

11:22.708 --> 11:24.958
Let's see if
you're as nimble!

11:29.625 --> 11:30.958
Guess not.

11:31.750 --> 11:35.625
Organics are too
slow to fight Warstar.

11:36.166 --> 11:38.750
Your
elimination
is inevitable.

11:46.291 --> 11:48.875
Initiate repair sequence.

11:49.625 --> 11:51.000
Take your time.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.166
Arrogant fool!

11:53.166 --> 11:57.250
To fight the Imperial Guard
is to face the wrath of
Gladiator!

11:58.125 --> 11:59.416
WOLVERINE:
I get the message.

12:07.208 --> 12:12.416
Your loyalty to this Jean
creature speaks well for
your species, human.

12:16.416 --> 12:17.458
Jean.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.583
Oracle,
you're making
this too easy.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.875
GLADIATOR: We have
fought before, Rogue.

12:36.875 --> 12:39.458
You know you
cannot match
my power.

12:39.458 --> 12:42.458
Come on,
give a gal
a little credit.

12:49.333 --> 12:50.333
(GRUNTS)

13:15.958 --> 13:20.958
My X-Men!
I never dreamed it
would end like this!

13:20.958 --> 13:24.250
Why do you not go
to him, Majestrix?

13:24.250 --> 13:27.708
The part
of me that is woman
wants to comfort him

13:27.708 --> 13:30.333
with every breath
that I take.

13:30.333 --> 13:35.291
But an Empress must be
made of steel, even at
the cost of her heart.

13:40.750 --> 13:44.375
Scott, I've lost
telepathic contact
with the other X-Men!

13:44.375 --> 13:47.625
I think
we're the only
ones left. In here!

13:48.083 --> 13:50.458
SCOTT: It's too shallow.
They'll spot us.

13:50.458 --> 13:54.875
Leave that to me.
We're safe, for now.

13:54.875 --> 13:56.625
Jean,
we don't have much time.

13:57.416 --> 14:00.583
There's so much I feel,
so much we haven't done,

14:01.416 --> 14:03.208
so much I want
to say to you!

14:03.208 --> 14:06.958
Where I'm concerned,
it's the thoughts
that count.

14:06.958 --> 14:10.291
And yours, like you,
are beautiful.

14:17.166 --> 14:18.458
Ready?

14:33.500 --> 14:34.583
(GRUNTS)

14:34.583 --> 14:35.958
Scott!

14:41.083 --> 14:42.875
I let you down.

14:51.375 --> 14:54.875
Majestrix! Sensors are
registering off the scales!

14:54.875 --> 14:56.958
Go to plan Omega! Now!

15:01.166 --> 15:04.583
Araki, get the weapons
online and fire at will!

15:04.583 --> 15:06.583
The Phoenix
must be destroyed!

15:07.500 --> 15:09.000
Lilandra was right.

15:09.000 --> 15:12.416
I know it now.
I must stop Phoenix!

15:12.416 --> 15:15.583
Hear me, X-Men!
You must revive!

15:15.583 --> 15:17.458
Phoenix must be stopped!

15:17.458 --> 15:19.166
This has gone too far!

15:19.166 --> 15:22.125
You must strike
while you still can!

15:22.125 --> 15:25.250
PHOENIX: The great Gladiator!

15:25.250 --> 15:29.583
How I have missed
the pleasure of
thrashing you!

15:29.583 --> 15:35.000
Scott, destroy
Phoenix now, before
she fully re-energizes!

15:35.000 --> 15:37.833
Professor,
there must be
some other way!

15:37.833 --> 15:39.583
There is not!

15:51.708 --> 15:53.083
(SCREAMS)

15:55.875 --> 15:59.125
I can't do it, Jeannie...

15:59.625 --> 16:01.166
How touching!

16:01.708 --> 16:02.750
(GRUNTS)

16:04.166 --> 16:06.208
Rogue! Now!

16:08.125 --> 16:09.625
Beast, now!

16:12.000 --> 16:13.625
Forgive me, Jean!

16:19.291 --> 16:21.000
It's done.

16:23.583 --> 16:24.625
JEAN: Scott.

16:25.583 --> 16:27.458
Scott, help me.

16:28.708 --> 16:33.375
The Phoenix is
growing within me.
I can't control her.

16:33.375 --> 16:35.250
Stop us, now!

16:35.625 --> 16:39.625
Jean! Fight it!
Use the powers
of your mind!

16:39.625 --> 16:42.958
I can't fight it!
Not every second
of every day.

16:42.958 --> 16:45.166
Never slipping,
not even for an instant.

16:45.166 --> 16:47.708
Scott, please. Do it!

16:47.708 --> 16:49.708
I can't!

16:58.708 --> 17:01.125
The weapons
just came online.

17:01.125 --> 17:02.500
But how?

17:02.500 --> 17:04.500
It's Jean!

17:05.000 --> 17:08.958
Jean,
come back!
Come back!

17:13.208 --> 17:14.708
I love you, Scott.

17:20.333 --> 17:21.750
Jean!

17:21.750 --> 17:24.416
Part of me will
always be with you!

17:28.375 --> 17:29.708
She's gone!

17:30.750 --> 17:32.708
You've won!

17:44.458 --> 17:49.291
You've got your
justice, Lilandra.
The universe is safe!

17:49.291 --> 17:51.875
I take
no pleasure in
this, Scott Summers.

17:51.875 --> 17:55.083
Don't. Not a word.

17:57.958 --> 18:01.500
I am the entity
known to you as
Phoenix.

18:01.500 --> 18:05.250
To save all that exists,
I became one with Jean Grey.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.291
We preserved the crystal.

18:07.291 --> 18:10.583
But
I discovered an element
to humans called emotion.

18:10.583 --> 18:12.625
I lost my way.

18:12.625 --> 18:16.458
Now that the
fire within Jean Grey
has been extinguished,

18:16.458 --> 18:21.750
I am as I was,
guardian of creation.

18:21.750 --> 18:23.750
And what about Jean?

18:23.750 --> 18:26.500
Or are the
dreams of a mortal
beneath your notice?

18:26.500 --> 18:29.833
The radiance
within her is no more.

18:29.833 --> 18:33.958
It can be rekindled only by
taking the flame from another.

18:33.958 --> 18:35.750
Then take mine.

18:35.750 --> 18:38.000
Sorry, bub,
you're out
of line.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.458
I'm your man.

18:39.458 --> 18:41.750
Don't even think about it.

18:41.750 --> 18:43.750
I ain't giving
you a choice!

18:43.750 --> 18:47.208
The gift
need not come
from a single entity.

18:47.208 --> 18:51.625
A smaller
portion from many
is possible. Be warned!

18:51.625 --> 18:55.583
Your own flames
would be diminished
by the amount sundered.

18:55.583 --> 18:59.083
We understand
and we accept.

19:16.375 --> 19:17.458
(SCREAMS)

19:20.416 --> 19:23.833
Scott? Scott?

19:24.583 --> 19:28.375
Jean! Oh, Jean!

19:29.500 --> 19:30.875
I love you, Scott.

19:31.750 --> 19:36.625
My time here has ended.
I must depart.

19:43.875 --> 19:47.166
The Mansion?
The control room?

19:47.875 --> 19:49.208
We're home!

19:52.875 --> 19:54.708
LILANDRA, TELEPATHICALLY:
Farewell, Charles.

19:56.875 --> 19:58.458
XAVIER, TELEPATHICALLY:
Lilandra,

19:59.750 --> 20:02.875
part of your mind
is hidden from me.

20:02.875 --> 20:06.875
You have
never denied me
before, why now?

20:06.875 --> 20:11.875
LILANDRA, TELEPATHICALLY:
As Empress, there is a part of
me that will forever be alone.

20:12.375 --> 20:13.833
Goodbye, Charles.

20:32.833 --> 20:33.875
