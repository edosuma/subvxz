Um, what's the scientific name for ogre?

11:12.960 --> 11:15.645
<i>Ogre ogre-is-not-realicus?</i>

11:15.720 --> 11:16.721
<i>(BOTH CHUCKLE)</i>

11:18.320 --> 11:20.209
I don't know, looks pretty human.

11:25.120 --> 11:27.088
Okay. I have a theory.

11:27.600 --> 11:30.410
This bullshit story
about a bear in the woods?

11:30.480 --> 11:31.720
You made it up, right? 'Cause,

11:31.800 --> 11:33.848
honestly, it's totally lame.
Nobody's buying it.

11:34.880 --> 11:36.405
So do you wanna tell me
what's actually out there?

11:37.800 --> 11:38.801
Okay, first of all,

11:39.360 --> 11:40.361
the bear is real.

11:40.840 --> 11:42.285
- It's deadly and dangerous and...
-Right, liar.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.971
- And, no, I am not, and second...
-Yes.

11:45.040 --> 11:48.647
You were out there this morning.
You helped the girls. Charlotte told me.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.968
<i>We're on The Island of Dr Moreau, here.</i>

11:53.040 --> 11:57.125
Whatever weird shit is happening,
it's coming from the big house.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.609
I know that disturbs you, Mud.

12:00.680 --> 12:01.841
So talk to me.

12:02.680 --> 12:03.761
Tell me the truth.

12:05.560 --> 12:06.721
It's not his fault.

12:06.840 --> 12:08.410
Who... Who are you talking about?

12:12.160 --> 12:13.161
Mud.

12:13.680 --> 12:14.727
Who's out there?

12:14.840 --> 12:16.171
You're gonna get me in trouble.

12:18.040 --> 12:19.371
Why are you so scared?

12:20.280 --> 12:22.408
Stay out of the woods.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.161
There's a bear in the woods.

12:36.720 --> 12:38.802
She's relentless, always has been.

12:39.280 --> 12:41.521
And she knows exactly how
to make me mad.

12:41.800 --> 12:43.245
How much of yourself
do you see in your daughter?

12:43.400 --> 12:45.289
Ugh, are you going to charge me now?

12:45.640 --> 12:46.926
It's not rocket science.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.240
Your problems with your daughter

12:48.320 --> 12:51.164
can trace right back
to your relationship with own mother.

12:51.240 --> 12:52.241
Jesus.

12:53.520 --> 12:54.646
We'll be here all night.

12:58.160 --> 12:59.650
Dr Elizabeth Perkins.

13:00.120 --> 13:01.406
Department of Psychology.

13:03.720 --> 13:04.721
(SIGHS)

13:05.760 --> 13:06.761
- Trauma?
-Mmm.

13:06.840 --> 13:08.842
Is that, um, PTSD?

13:08.920 --> 13:10.968
Survivors of abuse, that sort of thing?

13:11.400 --> 13:15.485
I'm looking at how PTSD co-occurs
with major depressive disorders.

13:15.560 --> 13:17.050
And you're in town for...

13:17.120 --> 13:19.168
Some case studies from a book.
A place out of town.

13:19.760 --> 13:20.841
Let me give you a card.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.009
You know what? Don't go to any trouble.

13:23.080 --> 13:24.206
I'll just lose it.

13:24.520 --> 13:27.410
No, take it anyway. You never know.

13:27.480 --> 13:28.891
Calmed down, have we?

13:29.000 --> 13:33.369
I'm just back to say you keep drinking.
I'm leaving, I'm taking a cab.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.970
- Sorry.
-Sarah, please. Take a lift with me.

13:37.240 --> 13:38.571
I'm sorry, I just don't want to let her
get away.

13:38.640 --> 13:39.641
Go. Go.

13:39.720 --> 13:41.484
- I'll get these.
-Oh, thank you.

13:41.840 --> 13:42.841
Thanks so much.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.769
Hey. Listen.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.606
Your daughter is struggling
on the threshold

13:50.680 --> 13:52.091
of what it means to become you.

13:53.920 --> 13:54.921
Remember that.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.001
Thanks.

14:01.480 --> 14:03.960
Let me get this straight,
you got Madame LaRue for French,

14:04.040 --> 14:06.441
and then you got that, uh,
scrumptious Mr Mitchell

14:06.520 --> 14:08.124
for homeroom and everything else?

14:08.200 --> 14:09.247
Mmm-hmm.

14:09.320 --> 14:10.321
Well...

14:12.080 --> 14:14.287
Hey, how's that cut on your arm doing?
Shall we have a look?

14:14.360 --> 14:16.010
(SIGHS) It's fine.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.481
<i>Okay-</i>

14:18.600 --> 14:19.761
Do you wanna go sit yourself down?

14:22.560 --> 14:25.484
I'm getting a nice bit of light
right on your face, there.

14:28.280 --> 14:29.281
Be still.

14:30.920 --> 14:32.081
I wanna see!

14:32.200 --> 14:33.964
No! Go sit down,

14:34.040 --> 14:35.451
-you're being impatient.
-(GIGGLES)

14:36.440 --> 14:37.441
Come on.

14:39.120 --> 14:40.121
Hmm.

14:40.200 --> 14:41.531
I really look like my mum there.

14:41.640 --> 14:42.801
Yeah, you do look like your mum.

14:43.240 --> 14:44.685
Been reminding me of her all day.

14:45.120 --> 14:48.169
Stomping around, breathing like a pug.

14:48.240 --> 14:49.321
I'm trying to help her.

14:50.200 --> 14:52.089
And what do you mean by that, eh?

14:53.200 --> 14:54.201
(EXHALES H EAVI LY)

14:54.880 --> 14:57.326
She's acting dumb, and...

14:58.160 --> 15:00.083
She gets mad at me
for going to visit Rachel.

15:00.280 --> 15:02.009
But she shows me things.

15:02.320 --> 15:03.765
Like, about why I'm special.

15:05.880 --> 15:09.521
Darling, you know that even if Rachel's
being nice to you, we can't trust her.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.168
-(EXHALES)
-Kira?

15:12.680 --> 15:14.728
We don't know what she wants to do
with that special part of you.

15:21.160 --> 15:23.128
Dr Elizabeth Perkins.

15:23.240 --> 15:25.447
Patient names, e-mails, histories.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.844
About two hours ahead, there's
a psychiatric facility, Cedar Ridge.

15:28.920 --> 15:31.730
Her contact there is Dr Nimitz.
They've never met.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.240
She's expected tomorrow.

15:33.480 --> 15:34.845
But she's showing up tonight.

15:36.040 --> 15:37.246
With her assistant.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.128
There's a patient, Alex Ripley.

15:41.400 --> 15:44.370
Not their real name.
Apparently a Neolution defector.

15:44.440 --> 15:46.681
High-level.
Close to old man Westmoreland.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.128
Probably being held against their will.

15:49.200 --> 15:50.770
It's a secure facility.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.929
Won't be easy to get inside.

15:53.280 --> 15:54.805
But we're going to make them talk.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.803
How did bloody Hell Wizard
figure that out?

15:57.000 --> 15:58.570
Well, he didn't, but he found Perkins.

15:59.760 --> 16:01.603
So who found the defector?

16:03.600 --> 16:05.841
Who's feeding you info close to P.T.?

16:10.760 --> 16:11.921
You always do this.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.525
I rarely do this.

16:14.960 --> 16:16.121
All right.

16:16.440 --> 16:18.249
About time, then, I'm gonna make a stop.

16:18.400 --> 16:19.401
Where?

16:20.000 --> 16:21.047
It's a convent, Mum.

16:29.600 --> 16:32.126
I cannot imagine you here in this place.

16:33.280 --> 16:34.930
(SIGHS) You never talked about it

16:35.000 --> 16:37.606
and you never even mentioned
Westmoreland was actually alive.

16:37.840 --> 16:39.444
We have a complicated history.

16:39.600 --> 16:40.601
Mmm-hmm?

16:42.160 --> 16:43.161
Ira?

16:44.600 --> 16:46.568
- You're jealous!
-Nonsense.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.804
- He's fossilised.
-(CHUCKLES)

16:49.080 --> 16:51.128
- No... You shouldn't...
-(GASPS)

16:51.200 --> 16:52.406
be walking.

16:56.360 --> 16:59.045
Just tell me what happened
between you two.

17:01.760 --> 17:03.000
Years ago,

17:03.920 --> 17:05.604
he chose another path.

17:06.920 --> 17:08.205
Another scientist.

17:08.520 --> 17:10.682
Someone who was willing to do
the things I wouldn't.

17:11.040 --> 17:12.883
And he led Rachel to stab you.

17:14.240 --> 17:17.961
I don't know how you can work for him
and his insane vision.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.730
Ira, do not mistake me.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.769
The vision is mine, as well.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.128
Our feud is only about the means.

17:38.040 --> 17:40.122
Have there been any other visitors?

17:44.000 --> 17:45.889
Vow of silence, maybe?

17:52.720 --> 17:54.006
This one's for you, love.

17:55.600 --> 17:58.080
- Yeah? You... you sure?
-Yeah, I need to get ready.

17:58.400 --> 17:59.481
Give her a hug from me.

17:59.840 --> 18:00.841
I'll meet you here after.

18:01.440 --> 18:02.441
<i>Okay-</i>

18:13.280 --> 18:14.281
Oi, meathead.

18:16.040 --> 18:17.041
<i>Sestra.</i>

18:23.440 --> 18:25.408
Donnie Hendrix told you our secret.

18:25.960 --> 18:26.961
Yeah.

18:30.240 --> 18:32.402
-(SPEAKING UKRAINIAN)
-(KISSES)

18:32.600 --> 18:33.886
We are family.

18:35.520 --> 18:39.286
Sestra Irina was kind to me
when I was a child in the Ukraine.

18:39.360 --> 18:41.169
She protect me from other nuns,

18:41.240 --> 18:44.130
so they call her blasphemer
and they take her tongue.

18:45.400 --> 18:46.401
Oh.

18:46.480 --> 18:47.481
Mmm.

18:48.080 --> 18:49.570
I am writing my memories.

18:50.000 --> 18:51.001
Your memoirs?

18:52.680 --> 18:53.886
(SIGHS)

18:55.040 --> 18:56.405
<i>Sit, sestra.</i>

18:57.440 --> 18:58.441
I think...

18:58.880 --> 19:00.086
Your heart is heavy.

19:07.320 --> 19:08.765
(WHISPERING) Sorry, darling.

19:14.880 --> 19:16.928
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

19:22.040 --> 19:23.041
(LAUGHS)

19:24.480 --> 19:26.403
Okay, not the welcome I was hoping for.

19:26.480 --> 19:28.323
- Where's the sibling love? (LAUGHS)
-Oh, my God.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.004
What are you doing here?
What's going on?

19:30.080 --> 19:31.605
- I'm waiting for my cocktail!
-(SHUSHES)

19:31.680 --> 19:33.011
(SOFTLY) Oh, is Kira sleeping?

19:34.640 --> 19:36.642
- Please tell me S didn't.
-Didn't what?

19:36.760 --> 19:38.728
Tell me everything? (LAUGHS)

19:38.840 --> 19:39.966
Probably not.

19:40.400 --> 19:42.767
She did shed some light
on those many sisters of yours.

19:42.840 --> 19:43.921
FELIX: She did not.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.889
Clones. Jesus Christ, what a trip.

19:45.960 --> 19:47.769
She had no right to do that, Adele.

19:48.200 --> 19:51.283
Hey, you know what? She trusted me.

19:52.720 --> 19:54.484
I'm kind of a sucker for that.

19:55.320 --> 19:56.606
You could have, too, you know.

19:56.680 --> 19:59.206
Adele, there was a reason
I didn't tell you.

19:59.480 --> 20:02.802
Oh, yeah, our life is hell,
and our people regularly die violently.

20:04.160 --> 20:07.482
All right, well, did I ever tell you
why I was disbarred?

20:07.640 --> 20:10.086
I just kind of assumed it was
'cause you were drinking all the Dom.

20:10.160 --> 20:11.810
That is a very good guess,
but you're wrong.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.280
I'm an embezzler.

20:13.640 --> 20:15.005
Corporate law, right?

20:15.240 --> 20:17.368
So I'm real good at following the money.

20:18.280 --> 20:19.327
Stealing it, not so much.

20:19.920 --> 20:23.049
- Oh, my God, this family.
-I know.

20:23.280 --> 20:25.806
Hey. Your momma has a job for us.

20:26.520 --> 20:28.841
How do you feel about
tracking patent-hoarding corporations

20:28.920 --> 20:31.651
and global profit flows in Switzerland?

20:33.800 --> 20:35.165
I hate fondue.

20:38.200 --> 20:40.123
I can't give Kira what she wants.

20:41.800 --> 20:45.043
She's cutting herself
for answers I don't have.

20:45.560 --> 20:47.927
I cut myself since I was small.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.641
But I stopped when I found peace

20:52.880 --> 20:55.042
and my sestras accepted me.

20:55.800 --> 20:57.040
She is an old soul.

20:57.720 --> 21:00.041
You should share our horrors with her.

21:02.200 --> 21:04.567
God, I don't want her
dealing with what we do.

21:04.960 --> 21:06.962
But she will have to, you know this.

21:11.200 --> 21:12.531
I wasn't a good sister to you.

21:12.600 --> 21:13.601
Yes.

21:14.160 --> 21:15.446
We tried to kill each other.

21:15.760 --> 21:17.524
(LAUGHING) No, no, after that.

21:20.640 --> 21:21.641
I avoided you.

21:22.480 --> 21:24.960
My twin, my other self.

21:26.600 --> 21:27.647
You scared me

21:28.360 --> 21:30.089
because of what you felt.

21:31.400 --> 21:32.845
You knew we were connected.

21:34.960 --> 21:38.203
Kira feels that, too.
She feels all of us.

21:40.440 --> 21:41.680
But I didn't until...

21:43.760 --> 21:46.525
Until I was half-dead on that island.

21:47.080 --> 21:48.081
She...

21:48.880 --> 21:50.609
Flowed right through me.

21:51.120 --> 21:52.326
Picked me up.

21:53.920 --> 21:55.081
(SIGHS)

21:55.440 --> 21:56.601
Is that what it is?

21:56.680 --> 21:57.966
Is that what it feels like?

21:58.400 --> 21:59.401
Yes.

22:00.120 --> 22:01.201
Here.

22:01.840 --> 22:02.921
Here.

22:05.840 --> 22:07.683
I don't give a shit about our genetics,

22:07.760 --> 22:09.364
this is what Rachel can't have.

22:10.240 --> 22:11.321
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

22:11.600 --> 22:14.683
I think this old man and Rachel,

22:15.000 --> 22:17.446
after babies, we will kill them.

22:17.600 --> 22:20.251
No, you're gonna take care
of your babies.

22:20.720 --> 22:21.926
Miracle babies.

22:24.520 --> 22:25.646
Like us.

22:28.640 --> 22:29.641
Yeah.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.001
MUD: I'm going for a walk.

22:41.640 --> 22:42.641
Just clearing my head.

22:42.720 --> 22:43.846
MAN: Where was it? Mud!

22:44.080 --> 22:45.764
You understand me?
I'm asking you a question, Mud.

22:45.840 --> 22:48.002
I don't know. I haven't seen anything.

22:48.080 --> 22:50.731
You're lying. Where is he?
Where does he hide?

22:51.040 --> 22:52.644
I don't know. Now leave me alone.

22:52.840 --> 22:53.841
Where was he?

22:54.240 --> 22:55.730
- I don't know what you're talking about.
-Mud.

22:56.280 --> 22:57.281
I know he's out there.

If we do,

37:41.760 --> 37:45.606
we can have the kind of conversation
both you and I love.

37:46.200 --> 37:48.248
A conversation filled with deep

37:49.080 --> 37:50.491
and far-reaching

37:52.200 --> 37:53.201
COHSGQUGHCG.

37:55.200 --> 37:57.362
Now, if we don't...

38:02.360 --> 38:04.840
- The conversation is very short.
-Yes.

38:05.680 --> 38:06.681
And it's a pity.

38:07.280 --> 38:08.691
Worse than death, really.

38:10.800 --> 38:12.404
To be left out of the future,

38:13.120 --> 38:14.645
after you put so much into it.

38:16.400 --> 38:19.802
You overvalue ruthlessness, P.T.
You always have.

38:21.440 --> 38:24.842
Rachel is too damaged
for this responsibility.

38:27.120 --> 38:29.168
She's done pretty well so far.

38:30.400 --> 38:31.526
She tried to kill me.

38:32.080 --> 38:34.560
I didn't intend for her to go that far.

38:35.760 --> 38:38.411
- I'm sorry, Susan.
-No, you're not.

38:38.840 --> 38:42.845
Your corporate-raised psychopath
is finally paying dividends.

38:44.800 --> 38:49.249
But admit it, scientifically,
you're lost without me.

38:52.520 --> 38:54.010
That's why I need you, Susan.

38:59.560 --> 39:04.487
I'd require real-time access to all
Rachel's new data on Kira's anomaly.

39:06.160 --> 39:07.161
Very well.

39:07.960 --> 39:09.530
Exclusive access.

39:11.200 --> 39:13.328
Nothing hidden, no more secrets.

39:15.560 --> 39:16.641
But...

39:18.240 --> 39:19.651
Rachel has the reins.

39:21.920 --> 39:24.844
So, to the future.

39:30.880 --> 39:31.881
To the future.

39:38.360 --> 39:39.361
(SCREAMING)

39:39.880 --> 39:41.803
What did P.T. do to him
to make him violent?

39:42.760 --> 39:45.604
- You have me.
-You? You were paid to lie to me.

39:45.680 --> 39:49.162
Kira, if you can teach me everything
you know about that feeling,

39:49.360 --> 39:51.408
then I'll tell you all the
grown-up stuff we do.

39:51.800 --> 39:55.202
Make no mistake,
P.T. put me at his right hand.

39:55.920 --> 39:59.242
All your hard work
is finally paying off.

39:59.520 --> 40:01.204
- Dress or leave.
-We'll dress.

40:01.840 --> 40:03.171
We'll learn more if we play along.
