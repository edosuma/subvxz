(male announcer)
Previously, on a very special
Clone High...

00:05.867 --> 00:08.100
Some voted with their heads,

00:08.100 --> 00:10.000
some voted with their hearts,

00:10.000 --> 00:13.067
Cleopatra voted
with her student body,

00:13.067 --> 00:18.200
and you, the audience,
voted to be absolutely riveted.

00:18.200 --> 00:21.333
(Abandoned Pools singing)
* Way, way back in the 1980s

00:21.333 --> 00:24.233
* Secret government employees

00:24.233 --> 00:27.033
* Dug up famous
guys and ladies *

00:27.033 --> 00:29.967
* And made amusing
genetic copies *

00:29.967 --> 00:32.933
* Now the clones
are sexy teens now *

00:32.933 --> 00:35.800
* They're going to make it
if they try *

00:35.800 --> 00:38.733
* Loving, learning,
sharing, judging *

00:38.733 --> 00:44.967
* Time to laugh
and shiver and cry *

00:44.967 --> 00:47.700
* Clone High

00:47.700 --> 00:53.267
* Clone High

00:53.267 --> 00:56.900
*

00:56.900 --> 00:58.267
Check it out.

00:58.267 --> 01:00.600
I'm the guy with
two French fries up his nose!

01:00.600 --> 01:01.800
Get it?

01:01.800 --> 01:04.633
[laughing]
That's hilarious, Gandhi.

01:04.633 --> 01:06.600
Ah, your impressions
are awesome.

01:06.600 --> 01:07.933
Uh, spaz?

01:07.933 --> 01:10.433
Putting fries up your nose
is not an impression.

01:10.433 --> 01:13.233
You actually are
a guy with fries up his nose.

01:13.233 --> 01:16.433
Oh, you like
impressions, huh?

01:16.433 --> 01:19.067
Hi, I'm Joan of Arc,
and I wear a retainer.

01:19.067 --> 01:21.400
[laughing]

01:21.400 --> 01:25.167
Hi, I'm Abe Lincoln,
and I've never laughed

01:25.167 --> 01:27.567
so hard in my life.

01:27.567 --> 01:30.667
Up high, honest Abe!
Whoo!

01:30.667 --> 01:32.967
This bent wire better not
cause an overbite,

01:32.967 --> 01:34.767
or in three to five years,
I'm gonna--

01:34.767 --> 01:37.067
[muffled speaking]

01:37.067 --> 01:38.100
Perfect.

01:38.100 --> 01:39.200
Oh, sorry.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.333
I didn't see
you there.

01:40.333 --> 01:42.500
I did, but I didn't
say anything.

01:42.500 --> 01:44.700
Wow, Cleo, you're doing
a bang-up job promoting

01:44.700 --> 01:46.300
the awareness fair.

01:46.300 --> 01:49.533
This year, the theme
for the awareness fair is...

01:49.533 --> 01:50.767
awareness.

01:50.767 --> 01:52.567
- Wow!
- That is a good theme.

01:52.567 --> 01:53.900
- I like it also.
[dog barks]

01:53.900 --> 01:56.200
And for a fundraiser,
I'm hosting

01:56.200 --> 01:58.200
an open-mouth kissing booth.

01:58.200 --> 02:00.933
Oh, for herpes awareness?

02:00.933 --> 02:03.500
Gandhi will take
a little sugar right now.

02:03.500 --> 02:05.367
Show some respect.

02:05.367 --> 02:08.100
JFK'll take
a little sugar right now.

02:08.100 --> 02:10.967
[slurping sounds]

02:10.967 --> 02:12.433
That was so hot.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.367
The girls definitely
won't walk away

02:14.367 --> 02:16.067
from our kissing booth
disappointed.

02:16.067 --> 02:18.467
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

02:18.467 --> 02:19.600
Whoa!

02:19.600 --> 02:21.133
Whoa.

02:21.133 --> 02:22.267
whoa!

02:22.267 --> 02:25.067
Our open-mouth kissing booth?

02:25.067 --> 02:28.533
More like your
open-mouth kissing booth.

02:28.533 --> 02:32.067
You know
my policy regarding fatties.

02:32.067 --> 02:33.200
Well, you don't see
me complaining

02:33.200 --> 02:35.200
about having to kiss
poor people.

02:35.200 --> 02:36.933
I'm sure you can make
an exception for one day.

02:36.933 --> 02:39.067
Well, I'm tired
of making exceptions, hussy!

02:39.067 --> 02:42.267
And I'm tired of playing
second fiddle to that pooch.

02:42.267 --> 02:45.633
There's nothing going on
between me and President Dog.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.500
What happened to us, Cleo?

02:47.500 --> 02:50.800
I'll bet you let him poop
in your backyard too.

02:50.800 --> 02:54.267
*

02:54.267 --> 02:56.900
Ring-a-ding-ding,
Mr. Butlertron, babe.

02:56.900 --> 02:58.067
[mumbling]

02:58.067 --> 02:59.200
Hell of a show last night,
Mr. B.

02:59.200 --> 03:00.633
What Frank said.

03:00.633 --> 03:02.767
Mr. B, I'm the principal,

03:02.767 --> 03:03.967
and you're a mere

03:03.967 --> 03:06.300
butler/vice principal/
dehumidifier,

03:06.300 --> 03:08.133
yet every student says
hello to you

03:08.133 --> 03:09.500
and ignores me.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.967
How can I get close
to the students?

03:11.967 --> 03:15.367
I try to listen with compassion
instead of killing them.

03:15.367 --> 03:16.800
Of course!

03:16.800 --> 03:19.067
It's that soothing
cardigan sweater of yours.

03:24.267 --> 03:26.100
Cleo, what are you doing here?

03:26.100 --> 03:28.900
I come here whenever
I break up with JFK.

03:28.900 --> 03:30.667
Seems like I've
been here a lot lately.

03:30.667 --> 03:32.900
Then these are lucky roses.

03:32.900 --> 03:36.133
- How do you mean?
- Uh...

03:36.133 --> 03:37.633
'Cause you visit them?

03:37.633 --> 03:39.267
Actually, Abe,
flowers are

03:39.267 --> 03:41.100
just the reproductive
organs of plants.

03:41.100 --> 03:43.233
They can't tell
when someone visits them.

03:43.233 --> 03:45.367
But--hmm.

03:45.367 --> 03:47.267
I'm just feeling sad.

03:47.267 --> 03:48.600
I don't know
how I'll manage

03:48.600 --> 03:50.067
the open-mouth kissing booth.

03:50.067 --> 03:51.067
Well, I could help.

03:51.067 --> 03:52.633
I love open-mouth kissing.

03:52.633 --> 03:55.567
It's so much more open
than closed-mouth kissing.

03:59.067 --> 04:02.700
(male voice)
Don't feel alone.
God is always with you.

04:02.700 --> 04:03.900
Did you just say something?

04:03.900 --> 04:04.900
Uh-uh.

04:04.900 --> 04:06.433
The voices...

04:06.433 --> 04:07.567
Finally!

04:07.567 --> 04:09.067
The voices!

04:09.067 --> 04:11.067
Come on now.

04:11.067 --> 04:12.300
Talk to me.

04:12.300 --> 04:14.467
I am not going
to open up to you.

04:14.467 --> 04:16.400
Lynn, quick, your cardigan.

04:16.400 --> 04:18.433
But it's cold and flu season.

04:18.433 --> 04:20.167
Give it!

04:20.167 --> 04:22.933
[sighs]

04:22.933 --> 04:28.233
Behold, the soothing power
of this enchanted sweater vest.

04:28.233 --> 04:30.900
Behold it!

04:30.900 --> 04:33.067
Do you have a BB gun?

04:33.067 --> 04:34.067
I have several.

04:34.067 --> 04:36.700
Wanna go shoot birds some time?

04:36.700 --> 04:38.400
I would love to!

04:39.700 --> 04:42.333
B, D, B, C, C, A, D.
Boop! I'm done!

04:42.333 --> 04:44.100
Do you mind?

04:44.100 --> 04:46.633
We are taking a test.

04:46.633 --> 04:50.267
Gandhi, just try and sit still
until everyone is finished.

04:50.267 --> 04:52.567
Not a problem, Mr. Sheepman.

04:52.567 --> 04:55.467
[humming]

04:55.467 --> 04:59.067
[fingers tapping]

04:59.067 --> 05:00.100
[pen clicking]

05:00.100 --> 05:02.467
[all noises combined]

05:02.467 --> 05:04.333
Rhythm is everywhere!

05:04.333 --> 05:07.167
[laughing]
It's true. It's everywhere!

05:07.167 --> 05:08.533
Darn it, Gandhi!

05:08.533 --> 05:12.233
I've had it
with your constant fidgeting.

05:12.233 --> 05:17.133
[blows raspberry]

05:18.900 --> 05:20.567
Who did that?

05:20.567 --> 05:23.333
[whistling]

05:23.333 --> 05:26.167
Your innocent whistling
doesn't fool me.

05:26.167 --> 05:30.633
I'm 70% sure that farting noise
came from you.

05:30.633 --> 05:31.633
Hall monitor!

05:31.633 --> 05:33.233
[door slams]

05:33.233 --> 05:36.267
I was so on today.

05:36.267 --> 05:39.267
[locker slamming]

05:39.267 --> 05:41.933
[drawer slamming]

05:41.933 --> 05:42.933
What's in here?

05:42.933 --> 05:44.967
Quit fidgeting, boy.

05:44.967 --> 05:48.800
Can't you see
I'm wearing a cardigan?

05:48.800 --> 05:50.833
What's his deal, man?

05:50.833 --> 05:54.533
Impulsiveness, hyperactivity,
short attention span.

05:54.533 --> 05:57.400
I'll run the symptoms
through my computer.

05:57.400 --> 06:00.400
[beeping]

06:01.533 --> 06:04.467
[beeping continues]

06:06.100 --> 06:08.267
[beeping continues]

06:08.267 --> 06:09.833
Oh, Wesley.

06:09.833 --> 06:13.067
You have A.D.D.

06:14.200 --> 06:15.867
A.D.D.?

06:15.867 --> 06:19.167
Am I...dying?

06:19.167 --> 06:23.367
No, it's A.D.D.,
attention deficit disorder.

06:23.367 --> 06:26.800
You also have A.D.H.D.,
its hyperactive cousin.

06:26.800 --> 06:29.367
Oh, wow.

06:29.367 --> 06:31.633
I need a minute
to think about this.

06:31.633 --> 06:34.300
*

06:34.300 --> 06:36.967
Hey, check out this
extra flappy skin on my elbow.

06:36.967 --> 06:37.933
What is that?

06:43.100 --> 06:45.667
[fingers snapping]

06:45.667 --> 06:47.400
* Did you hear?
Did you hear? *

06:47.400 --> 06:48.467
* Gandhi has A.D.D.

06:48.467 --> 06:49.633
* Incurable disease

06:49.633 --> 06:51.267
* Did you hear?
Did you hear? *

06:51.267 --> 06:52.700
* Don't tell Paul Revere *

06:52.700 --> 06:55.067
* Gandhi's contagious,
totally outrageous *

06:55.067 --> 06:57.800
* A disease with initials,
that's the worst kind *

06:57.800 --> 07:00.300
* A.D.D. has warped his mind

07:00.300 --> 07:01.967
* Did you hear?
Did you hear? *

07:01.967 --> 07:04.500
* Don't tell Paul Revere,
don't tell Paul Revere *

07:04.500 --> 07:08.400
* Don't tell Paul Revere *

07:08.400 --> 07:11.867
* Too late!

07:11.867 --> 07:13.067
* Bada-rum bada-rum

07:13.067 --> 07:14.467
* Bada-rum bada-rum
bada-rum *

07:14.467 --> 07:17.367
* Gandhi has A.D.D.,
Gandhi has A.D.D. *

07:17.367 --> 07:18.867
* You get it from toilet seats

07:18.867 --> 07:19.867
* Use a protective sheet

07:19.867 --> 07:25.433
* Attention deficit disorder

07:25.433 --> 07:26.633
* A.D.D.

07:26.633 --> 07:29.233
[panting]

07:29.233 --> 07:32.067
It can't be true,
but then again,

07:32.067 --> 07:34.500
it rhymed,
so it must be.

07:34.500 --> 07:37.633
*

07:37.633 --> 07:39.567
Jesús Cristo,
do you know the story

07:39.567 --> 07:40.933
of Joan of Arc?

07:40.933 --> 07:41.933
Yeah, I seen the movie.

07:41.933 --> 07:43.133
I got it on DVD, homes.

07:43.133 --> 07:44.467
She was, like, 16, right?

07:44.467 --> 07:45.867
And then God told her
to make the Frenchies

07:45.867 --> 07:47.300
fight the Ingléses,
you know, the people

07:47.300 --> 07:48.933
that drink tea all the time
and have big teeth?

07:48.933 --> 07:50.433
And then people started
getting mad,

07:50.433 --> 07:52.100
'cause she was hearing voices
and then at the end,

07:52.100 --> 07:53.400
she got cooked like a steak.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.067
Pretty good.
I give it thumbs up, homes.

07:55.067 --> 07:56.400
Basically.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.933
See, I've never been able
to live up to her.

07:57.933 --> 08:00.267
That's why, instead,
I became a cynical,

08:00.267 --> 08:01.867
angst-ridden goth girl.

08:01.867 --> 08:04.800
But now,
I'm hearing voices.

08:04.800 --> 08:06.733
Religious voices.

08:06.733 --> 08:08.567
Damn.

08:08.567 --> 08:10.367
Hey, they tell you who's gonna
win the Latin Grammys?

08:10.367 --> 08:11.500
If it's Ricky Martin,
don't tell me,

08:11.500 --> 08:12.500
eh, don't tell me.

08:12.500 --> 08:13.500
It's Ricky Martin, huh?

08:13.500 --> 08:15.233
This is totally freaking me out.

08:15.233 --> 08:17.167
Hey, take a hit.
Relax.

08:17.167 --> 08:18.667
God's message can be
a total trip.

08:18.667 --> 08:20.600
But you know that you have
to do what he tells you, eh?

08:20.600 --> 08:22.667
Because god has a plan
for all of us--

08:22.667 --> 08:25.933
a painful, painful plan.

08:25.933 --> 08:28.133
Wait, wait,
the voices are telling me

08:28.133 --> 08:33.133
to head on down to St. Paul's
Mattress Discounters.

08:33.133 --> 08:34.367
I have to go.

08:34.367 --> 08:37.300
Jesús, God's power is
in the mix!

08:37.300 --> 08:39.067
[nail gun fires]
- Ooh!

08:39.067 --> 08:42.333
Be careful with
that nail gun, Jesús.

08:42.333 --> 08:44.067
I'm worried about Gandhi.

08:44.067 --> 08:45.267
Me too.

08:45.267 --> 08:46.200
You don't think
he'll freak out

08:46.200 --> 08:47.400
and bite me, do you?

08:47.400 --> 08:49.233
He hasn't done anything
to hurt anyone.

08:49.233 --> 08:52.400
Hey, which open-mouth kissing
technique do you like better?

08:52.400 --> 08:54.067
This one...

08:54.067 --> 08:56.700
[slurping noises]

08:56.700 --> 08:58.133
or this one?

08:58.133 --> 09:01.500
[slurping noises]

09:01.500 --> 09:04.067
Hey, principal, look!

09:04.067 --> 09:08.067
I fit the entire freshman class
into just ten lockers.

09:08.067 --> 09:10.200
[laughing]

09:10.200 --> 09:12.267
- Oh, man.
- Oh, my.

09:12.267 --> 09:16.600
Oh, JFK, you're
such a wonderful boy.

09:16.600 --> 09:19.300
So full
of fun and life.

09:19.300 --> 09:21.333
I'm gonna go chuck
a dead gopher

09:21.333 --> 09:23.267
into the girls' bathroom.

09:23.267 --> 09:24.433
Classic!

09:24.433 --> 09:27.267
Jesus saves,
and so will we--

09:27.267 --> 09:29.300
on California kings
all weekend long!

09:29.300 --> 09:31.200
If you can find a lower price,
God will give you

09:31.200 --> 09:32.933
a bed frame for free!

09:32.933 --> 09:36.067
Oh, feel it!
Firm, but not too firm,

09:36.067 --> 09:37.967
just like the lord!

09:37.967 --> 09:40.367
No, Gene Kelly.

09:40.367 --> 09:43.067
It's shuffle, cha-cha,
spin left, shimmy,

09:43.067 --> 09:45.833
booty quake, thrust,
booty quake, thrust.

09:45.833 --> 09:48.800
Wow, Marie Curie's
mutated DNA may have

09:48.800 --> 09:51.967
left her grotesquely deformed,
but she's a really good dancer.

09:51.967 --> 09:53.800
Sorry I'm late,
but somebody forgot

09:53.800 --> 09:57.433
to tell el Gandhisimo
we had practice.

09:57.433 --> 09:59.167
Hey, before we kick it,
can I get someone

09:59.167 --> 10:00.767
to stretch my hammies?

10:00.767 --> 10:04.000
Gandhi, this is
really hard to say.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.133
I think maybe because of your
condition, you shouldn't be--

10:07.133 --> 10:09.033
You're kicking me
off the dance squad?

10:09.033 --> 10:11.500
The Solid Gandhi Dancers?

10:11.500 --> 10:13.167
But I'm the treasurer.

10:13.167 --> 10:15.233
What if you have
an A.D.D. attack,

10:15.233 --> 10:17.433
and you can't pay attention
to the moves?

10:17.433 --> 10:18.567
That's not gonna happen.

10:18.567 --> 10:19.700
Check this out.

10:19.700 --> 10:22.633
[scatting]

10:28.067 --> 10:30.067
Gandhi, stop,
you're out of control.

10:30.067 --> 10:31.533
Are you watching?
Are you watching?

10:31.533 --> 10:33.267
'Cause watch this,
here it comes, finish.

10:33.267 --> 10:34.367
Pow!

10:34.367 --> 10:36.500
[column slams]

10:36.500 --> 10:40.633
(woman)
I don't want that diseased freak
going near my Attila.

10:40.633 --> 10:43.167
I don't really think
it's safe for Gandhi

10:43.167 --> 10:45.067
to wander around
without a space suit.

10:45.067 --> 10:47.633
Folks, you all know me.

10:47.633 --> 10:50.733
I'm Toots,
Joan of Arc's foster grandpa.

10:50.733 --> 10:53.467
Now, I may be blind,
but I can see

10:53.467 --> 10:55.267
certain things loud and clear.

10:55.267 --> 10:57.667
This is a room
full of scared people

10:57.667 --> 11:01.133
making decisions based
on fear and ignorance.

11:01.133 --> 11:03.467
Now when I left
the house this evening,

11:03.467 --> 11:07.067
I intended to go to
Giovanni's Italian Restaurant.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.267
I can tell
I'm in the wrong place.

11:09.267 --> 11:11.333
So if you'll excuse me,
I'll leave,

11:11.333 --> 11:13.733
and let you get on
with your meeting.

11:13.733 --> 11:14.733
[crowd shouting]

11:14.733 --> 11:15.967
Settle!

11:15.967 --> 11:19.567
The bevested principal has
the answer.

11:19.567 --> 11:21.400
Therapeutic isolation!

11:21.400 --> 11:24.600
- That will solve everything.
- I feel so pacified.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.133
(man)
Is that cashmere?

11:26.133 --> 11:28.300
The man in the dapper
cardigan is right.

11:28.300 --> 11:30.767
Let's lock him up
like a diabetic.

11:30.767 --> 11:32.633
I move we form
an angry mob,

11:32.633 --> 11:35.433
just a whole bunch
of mens just running.

11:35.433 --> 11:38.567
(Abe)
I've never sat here
in the popular section before.

11:38.567 --> 11:40.833
Wow!
Salt and pepper?

11:40.833 --> 11:43.833
With me, Abe, it's
first class all the way.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.633
Abe, you've gotta help me.

11:45.633 --> 11:47.200
You're all I have, man.

11:47.200 --> 11:48.233
Is that pepper?

11:48.233 --> 11:50.467
Abe, do you have
a celibacy wish?

11:50.467 --> 11:52.633
No, no,
a thousand times no.

11:52.633 --> 11:54.800
Because when I see
you talking to Gandhi,

11:54.800 --> 11:57.067
I feel like totally
not kissing you.

11:57.067 --> 11:58.933
You want to kiss
something, Cleo?

11:58.933 --> 12:03.067
You can start
with my solid gold ass.

12:03.067 --> 12:04.967
Up high, Lincoln Continental!

12:07.233 --> 12:09.767
Dude, don't leave me hanging.

12:09.767 --> 12:14.067
Come on, Abe, it's me...
Gandhi.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.667
Don't you know me?

12:15.667 --> 12:20.400
Sorry Gandhi,
I'm kind of tired.

12:20.400 --> 12:23.867
[scoffs]
Fine.

12:23.867 --> 12:25.267
I never thought
the world would see

12:25.267 --> 12:28.500
Abraham Lincoln dissing
Mahatma Gandhi.

12:28.500 --> 12:29.600
Gandhi, no!

12:29.600 --> 12:32.300
Not our matching
friendship locket.

12:32.300 --> 12:34.600
"Best dudes forever," Abe?

12:34.600 --> 12:36.567
"Best dudes forever?"

*

12:59.067 --> 13:00.600
I brought you some fries.

13:00.600 --> 13:03.300
I was thinking you could,
I don't know,

13:03.300 --> 13:06.467
stick some in your nose
like old times.

13:06.467 --> 13:08.067
Keep your damn fries.

13:08.067 --> 13:10.733
Look, Gandhi, when I chose
not to high five you yesterday

13:10.733 --> 13:13.367
it wasn't because
I don't care about you.

13:13.367 --> 13:15.867
It was because I didn't
want to touch you.

13:15.867 --> 13:17.567
I'm sorry, is somebody talking?

13:17.567 --> 13:19.400
'Cause I don't see anyone.

13:19.400 --> 13:20.767
Gandhi--
[phone rings]

13:20.767 --> 13:22.600
Hi, Cleo.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.333
Yeah, I got your fax.

13:24.333 --> 13:26.700
I already called ahead
to the lip balm store, yeah.

13:26.700 --> 13:28.267
I'm goin' right now.

13:28.267 --> 13:31.433
I'm going right now.

* Running with the streets

* Got to remember the fire

13:51.400 --> 13:55.767
* Don't give in to the heat *

13:55.767 --> 13:59.067
* Remember the memories

13:59.067 --> 14:03.333
* Life is only a game

14:03.333 --> 14:05.300
* You're only a man now *

14:05.300 --> 14:07.200
* Remember your heart

Hi there, friend.

14:31.767 --> 14:33.933
- Wow, Tom Green.
- Who?

14:33.933 --> 14:35.067
You work here?

14:35.067 --> 14:36.433
Oh, I always make
time to teach kids

14:36.433 --> 14:37.967
the facts
about A.D.D.

14:37.967 --> 14:40.600
and/or A.D.H.D.,
its hyperactive cousin.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.633
- Huh?
- Hey, you're reading my book.

14:42.633 --> 14:44.233
Touch the book.

14:44.233 --> 14:47.967
Lick the book. Lick the book.
Lick the book. Lick the book.

Lick the book. Lick the book.

Book, book, book, book,
book, book, book, book.

14:55.933 --> 14:57.367
Yeah, I haven't read it either.

14:57.367 --> 14:59.067
People with A.D.D.,
they aren't good readers.

14:59.067 --> 15:00.500
Want to go shave a dog?

15:00.500 --> 15:02.500
My friend has A.D.D.

15:02.500 --> 15:05.633
And everyone at school treats
him like some kind of leper.

15:05.633 --> 15:07.133
Well, that's discrimination.

15:07.133 --> 15:10.233
Hey, do you want to go
take a dump on my parents' bed?

15:10.233 --> 15:13.733

Ahh!

15:30.967 --> 15:33.200
Go ahead, I'm here for you.

15:33.200 --> 15:39.200
I, uh--recently broke up
with my girlfriend, Cleo.

15:39.200 --> 15:43.533
Remember, too much emotion makes
Dr. Scudworth uncomfortable.

15:43.533 --> 15:46.933
But she was the first girl
that gave me--

15:46.933 --> 15:49.333
what's that word?

15:49.333 --> 15:50.633

What is this
touchy-feely bull crap?

Yech!

this sweater no more.

I haven't slept in 78 hours.

[chuckles]

16:22.533 --> 16:24.967
Oh, my goodness, I'm tired.

Jeez, that guy is,
like, 45.

16:28.967 --> 16:30.633
(Principal Scudworth)
Whee!

16:30.633 --> 16:33.533
It's experimental surgery time.

16:33.533 --> 16:35.267
Go on, man, do it.

16:35.267 --> 16:36.400
I want you to.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.667
Stick it in my head.
I hope it kills me.

16:38.667 --> 16:41.067
If you're not terrified,
where's the sport?

16:41.067 --> 16:42.333
I don't want to live
in a world

16:42.333 --> 16:44.733
where buds diss their homeboys.

16:44.733 --> 16:46.200
You're a high school principal.

16:46.200 --> 16:47.867
You don't know
what it's like to be lonely.

16:47.867 --> 16:50.867
On the contrary, Gandhi,
some principals

16:50.867 --> 16:52.767
do feel loneliness.

16:52.767 --> 16:56.067
We're not the invincible gods
that teen magazines would

16:56.067 --> 16:58.667
have you believe.

16:58.667 --> 17:02.100
Then I guess there's no hope
for guys like us.

17:02.100 --> 17:03.933
There's always hope, Gandhi.

17:03.933 --> 17:07.067
When life gives you lemons,
you clone those lemons

17:07.067 --> 17:08.800
and make super lemons.

17:08.800 --> 17:10.667
So go down
to that awareness fair,

17:10.667 --> 17:14.867
stand up for what's right,
and bring me back a funnel cake.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.667
But there's no way
out of this place.

17:16.667 --> 17:19.267
Isn't there?

17:20.433 --> 17:24.767
Oh, I think I know
what you're saying.

17:24.767 --> 17:26.867

[glass shatters]

You really helped that boy.

17:30.600 --> 17:34.633
I did,
and without the sweater vest.

17:34.633 --> 17:37.700
I guess it wasn't
magic after all.

17:37.700 --> 17:39.933
Or was it?

17:41.900 --> 17:43.067
[crowd gasps]

17:43.067 --> 17:44.567
Is there a Heather in the crowd?
Heather?

17:44.567 --> 17:46.733
Heather, I have
a message for you:

17:46.733 --> 17:48.067
Jerome wants
you to forgive him

17:48.067 --> 17:49.467
for hooking up
with Lupe at Trey's party,

17:49.467 --> 17:52.600
and God is commanding all of us
to give a shout out

17:52.600 --> 17:55.300
to all the locals
at the In-N-Out in La Puente

17:55.300 --> 17:57.233
His power is in the mix!

18:00.733 --> 18:02.133
(radio announcer)
We're 107 FM,

18:02.133 --> 18:06.433
where the mix of fresh
Christian jams slam first.

18:06.433 --> 18:09.067
His power is in the mix.

18:09.067 --> 18:11.200
Coming up, we've got
a rock crusade--

18:11.200 --> 18:13.967
40 minutes of nonstop Amy Grant!

18:13.967 --> 18:18.067
I can't--you know,
I gotta take--okay...

18:18.067 --> 18:20.133
[scoffs]
I can't believe it, eh?

18:20.133 --> 18:23.133
Jerome hooked up with Lupe?

18:23.133 --> 18:24.233

What the hell are
you doing here?

18:25.800 --> 18:28.500
You're selling kisses?
I'm buying.

18:28.500 --> 18:31.600
Abe, will you form a mob
and get rid of this loser?

18:31.600 --> 18:35.967
No, but I will inform a mob
with the help of this winner.

18:35.967 --> 18:37.767
- Tom?
- Hi, everybody.

18:37.767 --> 18:39.333
I'm Ottawa's Tom Green.

18:39.333 --> 18:40.367
I live in Hollywood.

18:40.367 --> 18:41.967
[applause]
- Thank you.

18:41.967 --> 18:45.100
So some of you may have
been mean to a kid with A.D.D.

18:45.100 --> 18:46.533
That's not cool.

18:46.533 --> 18:47.533
Coffee?

18:47.533 --> 18:49.333
Anyone--coffee, anyone?

18:49.333 --> 18:50.667
Huh?
Sorry.

18:50.667 --> 18:52.533
I like cotton candy.
Check out my muscle.

18:52.533 --> 18:54.067
Potato chips.
It's a Ferris wheel.

18:54.067 --> 18:56.067
So I guess what I'm trying
to say is--

18:56.067 --> 18:58.767
Plastic bag. Plastic bag.
Plastic bag. Plastic bag.

18:58.767 --> 19:00.633
Plastic bag.
Plastic bag.

19:00.633 --> 19:03.900
Like Mr. Green
so eloquently said,

19:03.900 --> 19:06.967
A.D.D. is not infectious.

19:06.967 --> 19:09.800
What is infectious is ignorance.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.433
If everyone keeps
treating Gandhi

19:11.433 --> 19:12.900
like a contagious freak,

19:12.900 --> 19:15.900
then this isn't
an awareness fair.

19:15.900 --> 19:18.933
It's an awareness unfair.

19:18.933 --> 19:20.533
(man)
Do you think
I was born yesterday?

19:20.533 --> 19:21.633
[crowd murmuring]

19:21.633 --> 19:22.867
(Tom Green)
Who likes cheese?

19:23.933 --> 19:24.967
Abe?

19:24.967 --> 19:27.367
You know what you have to do.

19:27.367 --> 19:28.700
You're right.

19:28.700 --> 19:32.300
(man)
* Am I on time?

19:32.300 --> 19:35.700
* Have I got soul?

19:35.700 --> 19:40.800
* Arrest myself
for being cold *

19:42.167 --> 19:43.167
[grunts]

19:43.167 --> 19:44.800
Dude, that was not cool.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.133
Not cool!

19:46.133 --> 19:50.067
And because of that,
I'm only paying you $4.

19:50.067 --> 19:52.333
My discomfort
with a man kissing another man

19:52.333 --> 19:54.667
is stronger than my hatred
for people with A.D.D.

19:54.667 --> 19:57.867
Hey, let's all accept Gandhi
and shun Abe instead.

19:57.867 --> 19:59.467
[cheering]

19:59.467 --> 20:01.967
Wow, Abe, your brave
homoerotic gesture

20:01.967 --> 20:04.333
has changed
my view about A.D.D.

20:04.333 --> 20:05.633
Just don't touch me.

20:05.633 --> 20:08.667
Gandhi, get on up here
and dance.

20:08.667 --> 20:10.333
But I didn't bring
my dance skins.

20:10.333 --> 20:11.500
Gandhi!

20:11.500 --> 20:13.667
Okay, you got me.

20:15.433 --> 20:16.767
Maybe I can help.

20:16.767 --> 20:19.633
I think God left
one last song in me.

20:19.633 --> 20:21.300
(man)
Ya'll ready for God?

20:21.300 --> 20:24.300
[dance music playing]

20:24.300 --> 20:32.233

20:38.633 --> 20:42.233
(announcer)
Next time, on a very special
Clone High.

20:42.233 --> 20:44.567
Will Abe and Joan's
student films reveal

20:44.567 --> 20:46.600
their true feelings
for one another?

20:46.600 --> 20:50.733
How will Scudworth get himself
out of another dangerous pickle?

20:50.733 --> 20:53.233
And what will become of Gandhi?

20:53.233 --> 20:55.867
I'd tell you, but I haven't
seen the episode yet.

20:55.867 --> 20:57.367
They were supposed
to send it to me,

20:57.367 --> 20:59.800
but there's this guy at work
who totally hates me.

20:59.800 --> 21:04.267
If he gets me fired,
I'm gonna kill his dog.

21:04.267 --> 21:07.167
(Abandoned Pools singing)
* Way, way back in the 1980s

21:07.167 --> 21:10.100
* Secret government employees

21:10.100 --> 21:13.067
* Dug up famous
guys and ladies *

21:13.067 --> 21:16.067
* And made amusing
genetic copies *

21:16.067 --> 21:18.833
* Now the clones
are sexy teens now *

21:18.833 --> 21:21.667
* They're going to make it
if they try *

21:21.667 --> 21:24.667
* Loving, learning,
sharing, judging *

21:24.667 --> 21:30.900
* Time to laugh
and shiver and cry *

21:30.900 --> 21:33.700
* Clone High
