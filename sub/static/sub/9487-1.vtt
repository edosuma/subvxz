01:24.542 --> 01:26.111
- What?
- Eddie.

01:26.211 --> 01:28.738
- Eddie, have you seen Boogie?
- He's over there.

01:28.838 --> 01:30.480
Thanks.

01:31.216 --> 01:33.451
Hey

01:33.551 --> 01:34.703
Boogs.

01:34.803 --> 01:37.038
Boogie. Come here.

01:37.138 --> 01:40.291
Jump up and shout now
Everybody shout now

01:40.391 --> 01:42.794
I was just downstairs in the basement.

01:42.894 --> 01:45.588
Fenwick is breaking windows
with his bare hands.

01:45.688 --> 01:48.299
He's punching out the windows
with his bare hands.

01:48.399 --> 01:50.719
And he'll break every one in the place.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.929
I'll go talk to him.

01:53.029 --> 01:56.307
Oh, shout now
Hey, shout now

01:56.407 --> 01:59.644
Everybody shout now
Jump up and shout now

01:59.744 --> 02:01.553
Get down and shout

02:07.335 --> 02:08.602
What's up, Fen?

02:10.420 --> 02:13.158
Just breaking windows, Boog.

02:13.258 --> 02:16.870
We're gonna take a short break
and then we'll be right back.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.153
What for?

02:18.930 --> 02:21.031
It's a smile.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.920
Come on, don't be a schmuck.

02:26.020 --> 02:29.340
I know glass is made from sand.

02:29.440 --> 02:32.385
How come you can see through it?

02:32.485 --> 02:34.929
Leave the windows alone.
What's the matter with you?

02:35.029 --> 02:39.059
- It's a smile, that's all.
- Yeah, I'm cracking up.

02:39.159 --> 02:44.763
Fenwick, you break another window,
and I'm gonna give you a fat lip.

02:45.874 --> 02:47.933
Now, where's your date?

02:48.626 --> 02:50.727
Gave her away.

02:51.462 --> 02:53.865
- What?
- I gave her away.

02:53.965 --> 02:55.784
David Frazer said she was death.

02:55.884 --> 02:59.613
So I said, "If you like the way
she looks, take her."

03:00.013 --> 03:02.165
What are you, the Salvation Army?

03:02.265 --> 03:04.825
I charged him 5 bucks.

03:07.770 --> 03:09.496
Come on upstairs.

03:10.899 --> 03:12.541
Come on.

03:16.154 --> 03:17.514
You really are nuts.

03:17.614 --> 03:20.350
What about her? She didn't have to go.
I'm nuts. Get that.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.894
That's what you get
for going out with 11th-graders.

03:22.994 --> 03:25.772
- Her brains aren't developed yet.
- Yeah, but her tits were.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.024
- Falsies.
- Were they?

03:28.124 --> 03:29.734
Firsthand info.

03:29.834 --> 03:32.278
Shit. Then what am I pissed about?

03:40.220 --> 03:42.705
Hey, Eddie. It looks like
you're having a lot of fun.

03:42.805 --> 03:43.915
Perk up.

03:44.015 --> 03:48.285
- How could you take Frazer over the Fen?
- Because.

03:48.770 --> 03:52.465
Diane, did you know
that Frazer paid 5 bucks for you?

03:52.565 --> 03:54.541
That's the kind of guy he is.

03:54.692 --> 03:56.460
He did?

03:58.446 --> 04:02.049
Do you want to leave with...?
You wanna leave with Frazer?

04:02.367 --> 04:05.395
Not really. Fenwick scares me.

04:05.495 --> 04:06.887
He's all right.

04:07.038 --> 04:08.857
Why don't you take me home?

04:08.957 --> 04:11.985
I go to law school now.
I have to go home and study.

04:12.085 --> 04:17.156
The only reason I came by here
is because I appreciate the fine music.

04:17.257 --> 04:21.911
- I thought you worked in a beauty parlor.
- Yeah, I do, during the day.

04:22.011 --> 04:26.114
Would you do me a favor?
Would you go home with the Fen?

04:27.016 --> 04:28.459
Okay?

04:28.559 --> 04:30.410
Okay?

04:42.323 --> 04:44.392
- Are you cold?
- No.

04:44.492 --> 04:45.852
I could turn the heat on.

04:49.664 --> 04:53.109
Elyse feels that Eddie is getting
very sensitive about the wedding.

04:53.209 --> 04:55.560
Yeah, I know. We were talking about it.

04:57.463 --> 05:00.241
You know what word
I'm not comfortable with?

05:00.341 --> 05:04.996
"Nuance." It's not a real word.
Like "gesture." "Gesture" is a good word.

05:05.096 --> 05:07.457
At least you know where you stand
with "gesture."

05:07.557 --> 05:13.203
But, "nuance," I don't know.
Maybe I'm wrong.

05:13.646 --> 05:16.966
- Aren't you chilly?
- No, no, I feel good. I feel good.

05:17.066 --> 05:18.968
- Am I going too fast for you?
- No. No.

05:33.207 --> 05:35.517
Look at that Fenwick go.

05:43.634 --> 05:46.371
You know, Elyse's mother
is very upset with Eddie.

05:46.471 --> 05:49.374
They picked out this yellow and white
motif for the wedding.

05:49.474 --> 05:52.627
You know, like we did.
Napkins, tablecloths, bridesmaids...

05:52.727 --> 05:56.714
maid of honor, the whole bit.
Anyway, Eddie objected.

05:56.814 --> 06:00.093
He wanted blue and white,
the Colts' colors.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.011
He refused to give in.

06:02.111 --> 06:03.888
So?

06:03.988 --> 06:06.381
Well, you know how stubborn Eddie is.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.310
Could have been worse.

06:09.410 --> 06:12.512
Could have been black and gold,
Steelers' colors.

06:14.415 --> 06:16.859
Billy's coming in on
a train this morning.

06:16.959 --> 06:19.487
I thought he was just
coming in for the wedding.

06:19.587 --> 06:22.240
We didn't want to mention it.
It's a surprise for Eddie.

06:22.340 --> 06:26.359
- What the hell's going on?
- I don't know.

06:40.274 --> 06:42.250
Stay here.

06:46.989 --> 06:49.007
Oh, Jesus.

06:56.374 --> 06:58.934
You son of a bitch.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.406
I really got you guys, didn't I?

07:03.506 --> 07:07.285
I've been carrying this ketchup bottle
around for weeks.

07:09.887 --> 07:12.707
- You asshole.
- Weeks.

07:12.807 --> 07:16.377
I hid behind the car. I didn't want
to get any ketchup on my dress.

07:16.477 --> 07:19.848
Weeks. Just waiting for the right time.

07:20.148 --> 07:24.177
Well, you got me. Christ,
I really thought you'd bought it.

07:24.277 --> 07:28.505
Real hard, holding back the laughs.
Real hard.

07:29.365 --> 07:32.852
- You really outdid yourself, Fenwick.
- That's very mature, Fenwick.

07:32.952 --> 07:34.520
Fuck mature.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.022
Hey. Hey.

07:36.122 --> 07:37.732
Sorry, Beth.

07:37.832 --> 07:39.984
Did you overturn this yourself?

07:40.084 --> 07:42.894
Yeah, yeah. Give me a hand.

07:44.422 --> 07:45.605
No way.

07:46.924 --> 07:49.577
Hey, come on, guys.

07:49.677 --> 07:53.331
Yo, Boog? Modell, come on.

07:53.431 --> 07:55.375
Hey, guys, come on.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.585
Hey.

07:57.685 --> 08:01.130
Fenwick, you turned this over by yourself.
You've got to turn it back.

08:01.230 --> 08:03.800
But it was easy getting it over,
because of the angle.

08:03.900 --> 08:06.677
- It's gonna be a bitch getting...
- Come on. Did you try it?

08:06.777 --> 08:08.336
I'll bet you didn't even try.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.881
I'm buying at the diner.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.353
You know, Fenwick, you're a schmuck.

08:15.453 --> 08:18.305
Another five seconds,
you would've had it for free.

08:23.503 --> 08:26.313
Hey, I'll see you guys later
at the diner, okay?

08:28.841 --> 08:31.244
You're a sick person, you know that?

08:31.344 --> 08:33.413
You're not a normal person.

08:33.513 --> 08:36.197
You guys really are sick, you know that?

08:36.390 --> 08:38.292
That's because you got no sense
of humor.

08:38.392 --> 08:39.460
Yeah, right.

08:58.246 --> 09:02.349
You can't compare Mathis to Sinatra.
There's no way, no way.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.986
They're in totally different leagues.

09:05.086 --> 09:07.363
Eddie, they're both great singers.

09:07.463 --> 09:10.741
You know the thing about Sinatra?
He's good, but he's too thin.

09:10.841 --> 09:12.160
I don't like that.

09:12.260 --> 09:16.873
Yeah, but you can't compare them.
Sinatra is the Lord. All right?

09:16.973 --> 09:19.625
He's big in movies.
He's big in nightclubs.

09:19.725 --> 09:22.545
Let me ask you another question:

09:22.645 --> 09:26.331
When you wanna make out, who do you
make out to? Sinatra or Mathis?

09:28.058 --> 09:30.636
- That's a stupid question.
- One question, answer that.

09:30.736 --> 09:33.890
It's irrelevant.
I won't answer it. Mathis.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.132
There you go. How about you, Shrevie?

09:36.909 --> 09:40.387
- I'm married. We don't make out.
- That's funny.

09:40.913 --> 09:43.316
- Hey, George, do you got a Band-Aid?
- No.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.443
- Come on, you have a Band-Aid.
- I don't.

09:45.543 --> 09:47.153
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.405
- You don't know?
- I cut myself shaving.

09:49.505 --> 09:53.034
Sorry about that Diane thing.
I didn't know you had a thing for her.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.619
Yeah, yeah, it's okay.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.704
Well, what about my 5 bucks?

09:56.804 --> 09:59.248
- Give me a couple of days.
- A couple days?

09:59.348 --> 10:02.084
Can I have French fries and gravy,
with a cherry Coke?

10:02.184 --> 10:04.253
Sinatra doesn't like
fatty foods, I think.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.372
Look who's here.

10:07.648 --> 10:08.799
Hey, how'd it go?

10:08.899 --> 10:11.302
Pretty good. Said she never wanted
to see me again.

10:11.402 --> 10:13.429
You're a charming person, you know that?

10:13.529 --> 10:16.557
- What happened?
- I parked the car on a nice, lonely road.

10:16.657 --> 10:18.643
I looked at her,
I said, "Fuck or fight?"

10:18.743 --> 10:21.979
Hey, that's a good line.
I'll use that myself sometime.

10:22.079 --> 10:24.649
- You're a maniac.
- You always know exactly what to say.

10:24.749 --> 10:27.068
- I love this.
- Well, how old is she?

10:27.168 --> 10:28.819
- She's jailbait.
- What is she, 12?

10:28.919 --> 10:30.196
- She'll be 12.
- Jailbait.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.657
- "She'll be 12."
- She's old enough to know better.

10:32.757 --> 10:36.035
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
She said she wanted to see me again.

10:36.135 --> 10:37.620
She liked me, sort of.

10:37.720 --> 10:39.580
- Get out of here.
- Come on.

10:39.680 --> 10:43.491
George, will you come here
and talk to him? He's driving me wild.

10:50.024 --> 10:51.583
What is that? Roast beef?

10:52.234 --> 10:54.804
Don't ask me this anymore, Modell. Yes.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.389
You gonna finish that?

10:56.489 --> 11:00.685
Yeah, I'm gonna finish it. I paid for it.
I'm not gonna give it to you.

11:00.785 --> 11:02.979
If you're not gonna
finish it, I'd eat it.

11:03.079 --> 11:06.566
- What do you want? Say the words.
- Go ahead. You eat it. That's all right.

11:06.666 --> 11:09.569
Say, "I want the roast beef sandwich."
I'll give you a piece.

11:09.669 --> 11:13.364
- Would you guys cut this out? Every time...
- He doesn't talk. He just...

11:13.464 --> 11:16.075
- You know what he means, right?
- I know what he means.

11:16.175 --> 11:18.286
If he'd say the words,
I'd give him a piece.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.288
If I wanted it, wouldn't I ask you?

11:20.388 --> 11:22.707
- Then ask. You know he wants it.
- Just let it go.

11:22.807 --> 11:24.667
- He wants it.
- You're annoying as hell.

11:24.767 --> 11:27.086
I'm annoying?
I'm trying to eat a meal by myself.

11:27.186 --> 11:30.256
If you want to give him the sandwich,
give him the sandwich. If...

11:30.356 --> 11:33.342
- I don't want to...
- Then eat the sandwich, and shut up.

11:33.442 --> 11:35.344
- Look at his eyes.
- I asked one question.

11:35.444 --> 11:37.847
Know what your problem is?
You don't chew your food.

11:37.947 --> 11:40.349
That's why you get so irritable.
You get lumps.

11:40.449 --> 11:43.144
You have roast beef in your heart
that just stays there.

11:43.244 --> 11:47.481
Oh, Modell, you're really, really
getting me mad. My blood is boiling.

11:47.581 --> 11:49.191
- I'll take the sandwich.
- Don't...

11:49.291 --> 11:52.361
- Fine. I'll take the sandwich.
- See what you do. Every time!

11:52.461 --> 11:55.114
Why are you blaming me?
He took your sandwich.

11:55.214 --> 11:56.824
- You want this?
- No.

11:56.924 --> 11:58.534
- You want this?
- I don't want it.

11:58.634 --> 12:00.995
- I do.
- I can't believe you're eating the...

12:01.095 --> 12:03.581
You two play against me.
That's what the problem is.

12:03.681 --> 12:05.323
You're both on each other's side.

12:08.018 --> 12:09.795
Come on, George. Lend me another 10.

12:09.895 --> 12:12.923
What do you want from me?
You owe me $10 already. Get out of here.

12:13.023 --> 12:15.092
- Boog, come here.
- Don't be like that.

12:15.192 --> 12:17.970
- Wait a minute, Bagel.
- Come here a second, Boog. Come on.

12:18.070 --> 12:21.297
Get out of here.
I don't want to talk to you.

12:23.868 --> 12:26.678
- What, Bagel?
- Did you lay down a bet with Barnett?

12:28.630 --> 12:30.524
- I don't remember.
- Yeah, right.

12:30.624 --> 12:34.153
Nobody bets $2000 and forgets, Boogie.

12:34.253 --> 12:35.363
So, what's the point?

12:35.463 --> 12:38.699
Well, the point is, Boog,
where are you gonna get the $2000?

12:38.799 --> 12:40.441
You haven't got a pot to piss in.

12:41.469 --> 12:43.537
Look, the game is a lock.

12:43.637 --> 12:47.208
Nothing's a lock, Boog.
Nothing's a lock.

12:47.308 --> 12:48.918
Look, you want me to call it off?

12:49.018 --> 12:51.587
Out of respect for your father,
may he rest in peace.

12:51.687 --> 12:53.913
Look, leave my father out of it.

12:54.482 --> 12:58.543
Listen, Bagel, just you should get in.

12:59.153 --> 13:00.753
I've gotta go.

13:01.572 --> 13:03.131
See you around.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.851
- Kids, man.
- Very crazy.

13:05.951 --> 13:08.729
Nobody's interested in making
an honest buck anymore.

13:08.829 --> 13:10.439
I heard he's going to law school.

13:10.539 --> 13:13.192
Well, that's what I'm talking about.
You call that an honest buck?

13:29.308 --> 13:31.877
Bagel heard about my basketball bet.

13:31.977 --> 13:34.454
And I'm already down for 10 bucks.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.092
- Big spender.
- Come on.

13:38.192 --> 13:42.263
Hey, listen, Eddie.
If you guys want in on this...

13:42.363 --> 13:44.974
I'm gonna tell you now
they're shaving points in this game.

13:45.074 --> 13:47.810
- You heard they're shaving points?
- How do you know?

13:47.910 --> 13:49.562
I know. This is no bullshit tip.

13:49.662 --> 13:52.565
I heard about your tips before.
Cost me 50 bucks.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.483
- How do you know?
- No way.

13:54.583 --> 13:57.153
- What's your resource?
- Don't get in.

13:57.253 --> 14:00.072
Will you listen to me?
They are shaving points on this game.

14:00.172 --> 14:01.282
You want in or not?

14:01.382 --> 14:04.034
They're definitely shaving points?
You feel secure?

14:04.134 --> 14:05.985
- Forget it.
- Who's the guy?

14:06.554 --> 14:10.791
- Why do you ask so many questions?
- Because I don't know who the guy is.

14:10.891 --> 14:13.461
Let me make it 15. Because...
Make it $15.

14:13.561 --> 14:14.837
Let me ask you a question.

14:14.937 --> 14:17.089
If you're really sure, make it 20 bucks.

14:17.189 --> 14:20.259
Don't do it, Modell. I'm telling you.
I lost 50 bucks last game.

14:20.359 --> 14:23.053
All right. Will you guys hop off
of the subject?

14:23.153 --> 14:25.389
- Can you quiet?
- Fifteen bucks would be good.

14:25.489 --> 14:28.434
Modell. Who do you pick,
Sinatra or Mathis?

14:28.534 --> 14:32.271
- Would you just let that die? Please.
- It's important to me.

14:32.371 --> 14:34.523
- It's annoying me.
- It's important in my life.

14:34.623 --> 14:37.777
You've been asking that question
to every man that walks in here.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.278
Would you just forget it?

14:39.378 --> 14:41.822
Maybe I have something to gain
from the answer.

14:41.922 --> 14:44.366
- Did you ever think of that?
- What does it matter?

14:44.466 --> 14:47.777
Let the man speak.
Let the man speak. Speak.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.414
Presley.

14:50.514 --> 14:51.707
Elvis Presley?

14:51.807 --> 14:53.918
There you go.
There's the definitive answer.

14:54.018 --> 14:57.922
- Sinatra or Mathis? It's Presley. Fine.
- You're sick. You're sick.

14:58.022 --> 15:00.382
You feel better?
Did you learn something?

15:00.482 --> 15:04.502
You've gone like two steps below
in my book.

15:06.780 --> 15:08.715
Once again...

15:09.366 --> 15:11.009
I guess you're full?

15:13.996 --> 15:16.315
I'd sacrifice anything
Come what might

15:16.415 --> 15:19.151
For the sake of havin' you near

15:19.251 --> 15:23.364
In spite of a warnin' voice
That comes in the night

15:23.464 --> 15:24.698
And repeats

15:24.798 --> 15:29.870
Did I tell you guys that I've got a date
with Carol Heathrow tomorrow night?

15:29.970 --> 15:32.081
You're taking out Carol Heathrow?

15:32.181 --> 15:33.999
No, you're taking her out.

15:34.099 --> 15:36.743
She is death.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.548
I only go for the best.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.842
Heathrow is cold.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.209
She's not a smart girl.
You ever talk to her?

15:46.195 --> 15:49.431
You wanna bet that she goes
for my pecker on our first date?

15:49.531 --> 15:51.934
The only hand on your pecker
is gonna be your own.

15:52.034 --> 15:55.855
Do you want to bet me?
Do you want to bet me 20?

15:55.955 --> 15:57.346
You got it.

15:58.207 --> 16:00.067
- I'm in.
- Me too.

16:00.167 --> 16:04.530
Yeah, I'm in too,
but we need validation for this.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.314
All right. I'll arrange it.

16:06.423 --> 16:09.910
How? What, are you gonna
get fingerprints?

16:10.010 --> 16:11.871
I'm telling you,
I'm not gonna do the dusting.

16:22.231 --> 16:25.593
- You bring your car?
- No, I walked. Yeah, I brought my car.

16:25.693 --> 16:27.344
You're going straight home?

16:27.444 --> 16:31.015
No, I'm going by way of Atlantic City.
What kind of question is that?

16:31.115 --> 16:33.684
Because if...
I'll wait for the other guys.

16:33.784 --> 16:36.979
You constantly do this. You walk out
behind me. You stand there...

16:37.079 --> 16:40.065
- Maybe you got plans.
- I have no plans. It's 4 in the morning.

16:40.165 --> 16:42.443
- You want a ride?
- I'll go with you if you want.

16:42.543 --> 16:45.446
- You want me to go with you?
- Say the words, "I want a ride."

16:45.546 --> 16:46.697
I don't have to go.

16:46.797 --> 16:49.116
I enjoy your company.
Do you want a ride?

16:49.216 --> 16:50.409
- I'll go with you.
- Okay.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.953
You got gas money? Just kidding.

16:53.053 --> 16:56.072
You're so serious lately, Modell.

17:13.615 --> 17:15.309
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:15.409 --> 17:18.311
You're too much. How'd you know
I was coming in this morning?

17:18.412 --> 17:20.021
We know, man. We know everything.

17:20.122 --> 17:21.732
You up for some diner?

17:21.832 --> 17:24.233
Hold on a sec.
I'm getting some coffee here.

17:24.334 --> 17:27.404
You're gonna get coffee before
we go to the diner to have coffee?

17:27.503 --> 17:29.147
I want coffee. Coffee.

17:29.298 --> 17:32.191
I can't believe
that Eddie is getting married.

17:32.342 --> 17:36.622
It's crazy. I mean, with Shrevie here,
it was nuts. But with Eddie, it's lunacy.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.999
Hey, marriage is all right.
I'm not complaining.

17:39.099 --> 17:41.377
Not complaining, huh?
That sounds wonderful.

17:41.477 --> 17:44.421
Of course it's not a hundred-percent
sure thing yet. Right?

17:44.521 --> 17:47.883
- He's getting married New Year's Eve.
- No, no.

17:47.983 --> 17:50.344
Not until she takes the test.

17:50.444 --> 17:52.304
- What are you talking about?
- Tell him.

17:52.404 --> 17:56.850
Eddie's giving Elyse a football quiz.
If she fails, the marriage is off.

17:56.950 --> 17:59.937
Football quiz? Come on, you guys.
Are you putting me on?

18:00.037 --> 18:01.438
Is this a joke or what?

18:01.538 --> 18:05.025
No. You know Eddie and the Colts.
It's very serious stuff.

18:05.125 --> 18:08.737
The test has got something like,
what, 140, questions.

18:08.837 --> 18:11.240
True and false, multiple choice,
short answer.

18:11.340 --> 18:14.243
It's an oral test.
He doesn't want any cheating.

18:14.343 --> 18:17.037
So wait a second.
What happens if she fails?

18:17.137 --> 18:18.998
- He's gonna call it off?
- Yeah.

18:19.098 --> 18:23.159
He swears to it. The test was supposed
to be two months ago.

18:23.268 --> 18:26.755
But Elyse keeps putting it off.
She's got a lot of pressure on her.

18:26.855 --> 18:28.465
- I guess.
- Yeah.

18:28.565 --> 18:31.051
It's not the best way
to start off a marriage.

18:31.151 --> 18:32.960
Eddie's crazy.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.074
Billy, you're missing
all the action now.

18:54.174 --> 18:55.284
Yeah?

18:55.384 --> 18:58.370
Yeah. Half the guys are
going to U of B night school.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.622
I mean, it's a lot of
fucking laughs now.

19:00.722 --> 19:03.709
- A master's in business. That's the lowest.
- Yeah.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.587
What are you majoring in now,
Fenwick? Still?

19:09.565 --> 19:14.970
- So who's at U of B?
- Well, Eddie's going, of course, and...

19:15.070 --> 19:17.931
- And then there's me.
- Yeah?

19:18.031 --> 19:19.641
- You going to law school?
- Yeah.

19:19.741 --> 19:22.019
Yeah, I thought I would give it a pop.

19:22.119 --> 19:24.772
I'm still working at the beauty salon
in the daytime.

19:24.872 --> 19:29.443
- But you were so good at the beauty salon.
- Cut and fuck, 2.50.

19:29.543 --> 19:30.944
All right, you guys laugh.

19:31.044 --> 19:34.239
- You ever think of doing your own hair?
- You guys laugh.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.575
- It looks good.
- Let me tell you something.

19:36.675 --> 19:40.996
I get more action in a week
than you've had in your whole life.

19:41.096 --> 19:43.572
No, I get it every night.

19:51.940 --> 19:56.261
- Billy. You're in town already.
- Hi.

19:56.361 --> 19:59.098
Yeah, I thought I'd come
and spend the holiday here.

19:59.198 --> 20:01.892
I heard there are a lot of good parties
and stuff.

20:01.992 --> 20:04.144
- You know your parents are out of town?
- No.

20:04.244 --> 20:06.897
They're in Florida.
They'll be back for Eddie's wedding.

20:06.997 --> 20:08.148
Is he still sleeping?

20:08.248 --> 20:13.269
What else? It's only 2:30. Wake him.
I can't wait till he's out of the house.

20:31.313 --> 20:32.890
Hey.

20:33.690 --> 20:36.375
Hey. How you doing, Bill?

20:36.985 --> 20:39.295
- What are you doing?
- Don't fuck with me.

20:41.782 --> 20:43.716
Still the early riser, huh?

20:44.117 --> 20:46.135
Yeah. Nothing changes.

20:46.328 --> 20:51.390
- Yeah, except you're getting married.
- Yeah. Ain't that a kick?

20:57.714 --> 20:59.950
Thought you weren't coming
until New Year's Eve?

21:00.050 --> 21:03.370
Well, nothing happening
around campus, so...

21:03.470 --> 21:06.081
Hey, did you bring that girl with you?

21:06.181 --> 21:07.416
No. We broke up.

21:07.516 --> 21:10.460
That's a shame. You know...

21:10.560 --> 21:12.495
that picture you sent me?

21:13.814 --> 21:16.049
It looked like she had
a great set of knockers.

21:16.149 --> 21:17.217
Yeah.

21:18.777 --> 21:22.222
- Didn't figure on you and Elyse so soon.
- Yeah, well...

21:22.322 --> 21:23.515
Whoop.

21:23.615 --> 21:26.810
Figured New Year's Eve would be good.

21:26.910 --> 21:30.262
Get married.
Party through the night, you know?

21:31.123 --> 21:33.567
I was pissed off.
I figured you'd at least call me...

21:33.667 --> 21:36.185
and let me know you were planning it.

21:36.378 --> 21:38.488
Yeah, well, you know.

21:38.588 --> 21:41.107
But you're my best man, right?

21:42.884 --> 21:44.026
Right?

21:45.804 --> 21:48.207
What do you think?
Of course I'm your best man.

21:50.976 --> 21:54.578
So Boogie and the guys picked me up
at the train station.

21:54.688 --> 21:56.038
Yeah?

21:57.316 --> 21:59.417
They didn't say anything to me.

22:00.610 --> 22:02.294
Surprise, I guess.

22:02.988 --> 22:04.296
I guess.

22:04.990 --> 22:08.060
- How'd they know?
- Barbara Kohler told Fenwick.

22:08.160 --> 22:11.063
Oh, yeah? You keep in touch, huh?

22:11.163 --> 22:12.805
Oh, yeah.

22:14.499 --> 22:17.069
Still nailing her, aren't you,
son of a bitch?

22:17.169 --> 22:18.686
Never did.

22:19.087 --> 22:22.991
You're kidding? What else would you be
doing with her all these years?

22:23.091 --> 22:24.275
Talking.

22:25.093 --> 22:29.280
- Talking? Am I losing my hair?
- You've still got a little up there.

22:29.431 --> 22:32.334
If you want to talk, you always got
the guys at the diner.

22:32.434 --> 22:34.628
You don't need a girl
if you want to talk.

22:34.728 --> 22:36.787
Eddie, you'll never change.

22:37.439 --> 22:41.792
Yeah, I saw it. It was in the papers
this morning, Marion. Yes, this morning.

22:43.028 --> 22:46.723
- Hey, you and I gonna shoot some pool?
- I haven't shot pool in ages.

22:46.823 --> 22:49.101
It's about time,
otherwise you lose your edge.

22:49.201 --> 22:52.104
- You still have the morning paper?
- Mom, what's for breakfast?

22:52.204 --> 22:53.939
The kitchen is closed.

22:54.039 --> 22:55.691
I'm hungry here.

22:55.791 --> 22:58.151
Wait a second.
You want something to eat? Make it.

22:58.251 --> 23:00.279
I don't have all day to wait on you.

23:00.379 --> 23:03.991
Come on, Ma. Don't give me that shit.
A fried baloney sandwich would be good.

23:04.091 --> 23:06.451
Get out of the house.
Billy, take him out of here.

23:06.551 --> 23:08.870
A fried baloney sandwich is not
a lot to ask for.

23:08.970 --> 23:10.664
Hold the wire, Marion, will you?

23:10.764 --> 23:14.418
Eddie, you're giving me a headache.
Take a walk.

23:14.518 --> 23:17.995
What are you gonna do?
You gonna stab me?

23:18.397 --> 23:21.258
Come on. Come on.

23:21.358 --> 23:23.918
- Come on.
- You miserable creature.

23:24.486 --> 23:26.179
How did you get to be such a thing?

23:26.279 --> 23:28.515
- Take your best shot.
- Who do you think you are?

23:28.615 --> 23:30.851
And then I'm gonna
punch your lights out.

23:30.951 --> 23:32.394
You don't even look like me.

23:34.454 --> 23:37.858
Where'd you come from? Get married
and get out of this house. Quick.

23:37.958 --> 23:41.236
Come on, go for the gut.
Then you, you're going down and out.

23:41.336 --> 23:43.822
Come on, I've got fists of granite.
Come on.

23:43.922 --> 23:47.367
- How did you turn into such a thing?
- I won't look. Hit me right here.

23:47.467 --> 23:49.786
And ruin my good knife on you?
It's not worth it.

23:49.886 --> 23:52.863
Sit down. I'll fix you something to eat,
and that's it.

23:53.181 --> 23:55.699
Eat a sandwich, then give me some peace.

23:56.184 --> 23:58.086
- Billy, you want something?
- No, thanks.

23:58.186 --> 24:01.080
- You sure? It's no trouble.
- No, really, I'm fine.

24:01.731 --> 24:03.457
A lot's changed around here.

24:04.693 --> 24:07.012
Oh, I'm never going to get married.

24:07.112 --> 24:10.223
Never, never.

24:10.323 --> 24:12.174
Aren't you, my Jo?

24:12.576 --> 24:15.437
Is this show in color
or is something wrong with this set?

24:15.537 --> 24:19.441
No, there's nothing wrong with the set.
This is a black-and-white set.

24:19.541 --> 24:22.903
It... I don't think they're showing
the movie in color anyway.

24:23.003 --> 24:25.364
I don't like color television.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.898
Don't like color for nothing.

24:29.134 --> 24:34.122
I saw Bonanza over at my in-laws,
and it was not for me.

24:34.222 --> 24:36.865
The Ponderosa looked faked.

24:37.767 --> 24:39.868
I hardly recognized Little Joe.

24:40.020 --> 24:41.797
Well, maybe you had to tune it.

24:41.897 --> 24:44.966
Not for me. Have you got an Emerson?
I hear they're real good.

24:45.066 --> 24:48.845
Yeah. I've got an Emerson. I've got
an Emerson right here. It's a good set.

24:48.945 --> 24:52.516
- What's all that stuff?
- This? You've got a high-fidelity system.

24:52.616 --> 24:55.435
I don't want any high-fidelity system
with my television.

24:55.535 --> 25:01.191
All I want is a 21 -inch Emerson,
cabinet style.

25:01.291 --> 25:06.905
Hey, Kenny, we got any Emerson,
21 inches, without the record player in it?

25:07.005 --> 25:10.700
- I'll check in the warehouse.
- He's gonna check that in the warehouse.

25:10.800 --> 25:13.245
It'll take a few minutes.
Why don't you look around?

25:13.345 --> 25:16.123
I'll look around
at some of the television sets.

25:16.223 --> 25:17.615
You do that.

25:21.019 --> 25:24.172
I talked to Boog.
He's taking Carol to the Strand tonight.

25:24.272 --> 25:26.133
The Strand?

25:26.233 --> 25:29.001
- He's gonna try it in the Strand?
- Yeah.

25:29.444 --> 25:30.804
So, what do you want to do?

25:30.904 --> 25:32.597
I'll be there. A few seats away.

25:32.697 --> 25:36.476
Yeah, I'll be there too.
I got 20 bucks on this thing.

25:36.576 --> 25:38.145
Don't want any judgment calls.

25:38.245 --> 25:40.647
He's got a couple of C's
riding on this already.

25:40.747 --> 25:42.649
- He's making bets left and right.
- What?

25:42.749 --> 25:47.144
- He's got 200 bucks on this already?
- Yeah. A lot of people bet for Carol.

25:52.217 --> 25:54.744
What have you been doing?
You been drinking already?

25:54.844 --> 25:57.038
Yeah. I guess so.

25:57.138 --> 25:58.748
What for? It's too early.

25:58.848 --> 26:01.168
I don't know.
I'm getting antsy or something.

26:01.268 --> 26:03.128
I can't figure out what. I don't know.

26:03.228 --> 26:05.788
I'll see you at the Strand tonight.

26:08.316 --> 26:10.292
Hey, Fen.

26:13.488 --> 26:15.390
Are you sure you're all right?

26:15.490 --> 26:18.175
Yeah. Hey.

26:24.374 --> 26:26.234
Hey. What do you say, Knocko?

26:26.334 --> 26:27.611
Hey, Billy.

26:27.711 --> 26:30.280
- How are you doing?
- Eat, sleep, you know.

26:30.380 --> 26:32.574
I never see you and the guys anymore.

26:32.674 --> 26:35.118
You know how it is.
Time to move on, I guess.

26:35.218 --> 26:37.329
You got change for a quarter?

26:37.429 --> 26:40.415
- Doing okay, Billy?
- Yeah, I'm going for my master's.

26:40.515 --> 26:42.032
Hey, wonderful.

26:42.142 --> 26:44.660
Take seven. It's got a new felt.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.006
What are you doing it for?

26:48.106 --> 26:51.092
Well, It's not like I'm doing it
just to make her happy.

26:51.192 --> 26:52.876
To hell with that.

26:53.737 --> 26:56.213
No, you wouldn't want to make her happy.

26:56.740 --> 27:00.050
Anyway, she's the only one
I really care about.

27:00.327 --> 27:04.272
You know, it's not like I go looking
for girls to date, or anything like that.

27:04.372 --> 27:07.725
You know, it seems
like the right time and all.

27:08.543 --> 27:10.320
At least she's not a ballbreaker.

27:10.420 --> 27:14.982
Christ. If she was a ballbreaker,
there'd be no way.

27:15.967 --> 27:17.494
Right?

27:19.971 --> 27:21.122
How you doing?

27:21.222 --> 27:24.709
It's one thing to wear your dog collar,
but when it turns into a noose...

27:24.809 --> 27:28.046
I'd rather have my freedom.
A man in jail is always for freedom.

27:28.146 --> 27:31.550
Except, if you'll excuse me, J.J.,
I'm not in jail.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.261
You're blind, Mr. McGoo.
This is the crossroad for me.

27:34.361 --> 27:37.556
I won't get Kello. Not for a
lifetime pass to the polo grounds.

27:37.656 --> 27:40.433
Not if you serve me Cleopatra
on a plate.

27:40.533 --> 27:42.936
And that is why you put your hands
on my sister.

27:43.036 --> 27:44.771
J.J., please. Susie tried to...

27:44.871 --> 27:48.608
It's Methan's favorite movie,
Sweet Smell of Success.

27:48.708 --> 27:51.101
- He memorized the whole movie?
- Yeah.

27:51.294 --> 27:55.105
These younger guys, I tell you,
they're crazier than we were.

27:55.340 --> 27:57.867
Eddie, are you taking
any of Boogie's action?

27:57.967 --> 28:01.570
Yeah. No way he pulls this off.

28:06.184 --> 28:08.827
There's a boy up there watching me.

28:24.828 --> 28:28.680
There he goes. Funny feeling,
being looked at without knowing it.

28:30.417 --> 28:33.862
Remember that family
that lived next door to us back home?

28:33.962 --> 28:35.405
Yeah.

28:35.505 --> 28:37.824
Their son used to look at me.

28:37.924 --> 28:39.525
Without you knowing it?

28:40.552 --> 28:44.331
Well, his bedroom
was right across from mine.

28:44.431 --> 28:49.868
One night I felt naughty and went
right on undressing so he could see.

28:50.478 --> 28:54.841
She says I bounce when I walk. Do I?

28:54.941 --> 28:56.917
- Do I?
- What?

28:57.402 --> 28:59.095
This thing even hurts.

28:59.195 --> 29:02.807
And I couldn't blast my way into
this cast-iron girdle with dynamite.

29:02.907 --> 29:05.769
I've had just about enough
rebellion for one afternoon.

29:05.869 --> 29:09.272
- First you.
- Pants off.

29:09.372 --> 29:12.391
- Why do you try to destroy it?
- I don't want her stared at.

29:13.293 --> 29:15.862
So you insist on desexing her...

29:15.962 --> 29:18.063
as though sex were synonymous with dirt.

29:32.437 --> 29:34.580
This is the old rose garden.

29:36.399 --> 29:38.917
It's sort of gone to seed.

29:45.825 --> 29:47.801
The rose's thorn scratched you.

29:48.036 --> 29:49.344
It's nothing.

29:51.479 --> 29:53.483
Did you ever catch fireflies?

29:53.583 --> 29:56.236
When I was young,
I used to put them in a bottle...

29:56.336 --> 29:58.905
and see if I could get enough
to read by.

29:59.005 --> 30:01.032
There used to be goldfish here.

30:01.132 --> 30:04.327
- Did you ever catch any?
- No. I wasn't supposed to.

30:04.427 --> 30:08.363
Then last winter, we forgot to take
them out and they all froze solid.

30:10.725 --> 30:13.869
That poor cupid.
He looks lost without them.

30:14.145 --> 30:17.497
He looks like he's waiting to be kissed.

30:18.858 --> 30:20.417
He is.

30:21.903 --> 30:23.587
How can you tell?

30:24.405 --> 30:26.298
Well, I can't really.

30:27.158 --> 30:29.259
I just know how he feels.

30:40.463 --> 30:42.365
Shrevie, what's going on?

30:42.465 --> 30:44.775
I have no idea.

30:45.844 --> 30:48.913
- Would you hold on a second?
- You are disgusting.

30:49.013 --> 30:53.543
Look, I know it was really terrible.
It was horrible, but it was an accident.

30:53.643 --> 30:55.003
An accident?

30:55.103 --> 30:58.673
No, Carol, seriously.
It was an accident. I swear to God.

30:58.773 --> 31:02.918
An accident. Your thing just got
into a box of popcorn.

31:06.531 --> 31:08.465
Well, damn near that.

31:10.577 --> 31:12.687
- Listen, can I be straight with you?
- Boogie.

31:12.787 --> 31:15.430
Wait, look. There's a real good reason.

31:15.623 --> 31:19.810
You know, but it's like...
It's a little embarrassing to me.

31:20.003 --> 31:23.855
I mean, so maybe if you don't want
to hear it, I'll understand.

31:24.007 --> 31:26.316
Go on. I want to hear this.

31:26.759 --> 31:28.402
Well...

31:28.845 --> 31:30.737
I don't know, it's just...

31:31.306 --> 31:36.169
I don't like to tell this to girls, but,
you know, you really are a knockout.

31:36.269 --> 31:40.048
No, you really are. And sitting down
next to you in there got me crazy.

31:40.148 --> 31:41.790
I got a hard on.

31:42.317 --> 31:45.553
You know, I mean,
I don't like to admit it, but I did.

31:45.653 --> 31:50.683
I mean, you don't know me. You know, I try
to come off like I'm being cool all the time.

31:50.783 --> 31:55.230
I don't like to look like I'm hustling,
and there I was next to you with a boner.

31:55.330 --> 31:57.273
You know, I don't...

31:57.373 --> 31:58.974
Am I embarrassing you?

32:00.418 --> 32:02.144
Go on.

32:02.712 --> 32:05.740
I don't know, it's just that
the pain was killing me, you know?

32:05.840 --> 32:09.452
It was to stop the pain.
It was digging into the side of my leg.

32:09.552 --> 32:13.321
So what I did was, you know,
I opened my fly to loosen everything up.

32:13.431 --> 32:15.625
Just to give it a little air.

32:15.725 --> 32:17.159
And, you know, it worked.

32:17.268 --> 32:21.548
Everything settled down and then I got,
you know, caught back up in the picture.

32:21.648 --> 32:25.051
And then, you know, when Sandra
got her leg caught on the bush...

32:25.151 --> 32:28.388
and she lifted up her dress,
you know, it just popped right up.

32:28.488 --> 32:31.057
And it went through the bottom
of the popcorn box.

32:31.157 --> 32:34.394
And the force of it
just opened up the flap.

32:34.494 --> 32:36.980
It just pushed the flap open?

32:37.080 --> 32:40.233
It's Ripley's. I'm telling you,
it just pushed the flap right open.

32:40.333 --> 32:44.102
And I couldn't move the box.
You know, you would have seen it.

32:46.339 --> 32:47.773
That's true.

32:49.175 --> 32:50.859
Come on.

32:52.470 --> 32:54.362
Let's go back inside.

32:54.931 --> 32:56.749
- Okay?
- Okay.

32:56.849 --> 32:58.075
Come on.

32:58.476 --> 32:59.627
All right.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.915
We'll just get a seat in the back here.

33:05.650 --> 33:09.628
Do you care if I kiss you right here
in front of God and everybody?

33:09.821 --> 33:11.671
I can't wait either.

33:16.577 --> 33:18.938
What's that guy's name? The actor?

33:19.038 --> 33:20.639
Troy Donahue.

33:20.999 --> 33:23.600
Troy. What kind of name is Troy?

33:24.002 --> 33:25.560
He's gorgeous.

33:25.670 --> 33:28.605
You ever hear of a guy
with the name of Troy?

33:28.798 --> 33:31.117
Yeah. Troy Swartzman from Towanda.

33:31.217 --> 33:35.038
This movie was written by the author
of The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit.

33:35.138 --> 33:37.373
I wonder where that Barbara girl
and Billy are.

33:37.473 --> 33:39.292
I'd really like to see this again.

33:39.392 --> 33:41.159
You can take Elyse.

33:41.519 --> 33:43.203
Hi.

33:44.647 --> 33:47.958
Fellas, don't forget to bring
some tens tonight.

33:48.693 --> 33:50.043
Ten whats?

33:50.361 --> 33:51.554
I don't know.

33:51.654 --> 33:55.590
Death. I'd give up your life
if I could have her.

34:15.178 --> 34:16.570
We're even.

34:17.346 --> 34:19.415
Take it easy. Take it easy.

34:19.514 --> 34:20.792
Is he okay?

34:20.891 --> 34:24.462
- Damn. That's Willard Broxton.
- Is he hurt?

34:24.562 --> 34:26.547
Long time coming, Bill?

34:26.647 --> 34:30.217
I couldn't believe it. There he was.
I didn't want to hit him, but I had to.

34:30.318 --> 34:33.012
Definitely. You had to.
I mean, Willard Broxton.

34:33.112 --> 34:34.389
Who's Willard Broxton?

34:34.489 --> 34:36.349
You should have said something.

34:36.449 --> 34:39.393
- What am I gonna say?
- Hey, I got Willard! Boo.

34:40.828 --> 34:43.940
- Shrevie, who is Willard Broxton?
- I always liked Willard Broxton.

34:44.040 --> 34:46.275
- You liked him?
- I used to take his milk money.

34:46.375 --> 34:48.527
That was outstanding.
I'll see you guys later.

34:48.628 --> 34:50.655
- Are we gonna go eat?
- I'm not in the mood.

34:50.755 --> 34:51.864
Going to the diner?

34:51.964 --> 34:54.283
Later. Gonna go to the
TV station to see Barbara.

34:54.382 --> 34:57.694
Shrevie, who is Willard Broxton?

34:58.221 --> 35:02.709
Well, it was the 11th grade.
No, no, it was the 10th grade. That's right.

35:02.809 --> 35:06.379
Billy was playing ball against
one of the high school fraternities.

35:06.479 --> 35:08.371
I think they were ULP.

35:08.564 --> 35:12.552
So Billy comes sliding into second base
to break up the double play...

35:12.652 --> 35:16.338
and the second baseman thought
that Billy was trying to hurt him.

35:16.447 --> 35:19.767
So he jumped on Billy.
So Billy punched the guy.

35:19.867 --> 35:23.011
And then, the whole ULP team
jumped on Billy.

35:23.162 --> 35:24.772
They beat the crap out of him.

35:24.872 --> 35:27.400
He's been waiting
for them after all these years?

35:27.500 --> 35:31.195
- Well, he swore he'd get them.
- That was forever ago, Shrevie.

35:31.295 --> 35:35.867
So Broxton makes it eight. Or seven.
Seven? No, no. It's eight. That's right.

35:35.967 --> 35:37.817
There's one guy left.

35:38.177 --> 35:40.987
What are you waiting for? It's open.

35:45.852 --> 35:49.172
What about the slides?
I didn't hear anything about the slides.

35:49.272 --> 35:53.208
- There's not much time before the news.
- Yeah, I tried to call.

35:53.526 --> 35:56.336
The switchboard closes down at 10.

35:58.156 --> 36:01.017
I was getting the feeling
that you were trying to avoid me.

36:01.117 --> 36:03.802
Oh, that's not true, Billy.

36:19.844 --> 36:22.163
Do you want to run down
the film chains for me?

36:22.263 --> 36:25.249
The governor's press conference on 3.
There's a B roll of it.

36:25.349 --> 36:27.867
And the slides? One.

36:36.319 --> 36:39.212
- Stand by for cold tease.
- Ten seconds.

36:39.864 --> 36:43.967
- Who's the visitor?
- Friend of mine. Five seconds.

36:44.702 --> 36:46.344
And, one. Mike, cue.

36:46.454 --> 36:49.273
President Eisenhower returns
from the World Peace Tour.

36:49.373 --> 36:53.861
Steel dispute continues. Interviews
with John Unitas and Coach Ewbank...

36:53.961 --> 36:56.781
in preparation
for tomorrow's championship game.

36:56.881 --> 36:58.950
These and other stories next.

36:59.050 --> 37:01.119
Roll three, three and track.

37:01.219 --> 37:04.539
Willy, after this I still have
a lot of work to do.

37:04.639 --> 37:06.582
Why don't you call in the morning?

37:06.682 --> 37:09.210
- Where's the news opening?
- Six.

37:09.310 --> 37:11.754
Okay. What's good?

37:11.854 --> 37:16.050
Church services are at 10, 8:30, 9.

37:16.150 --> 37:19.303
Punch ID, and announce.

37:19.403 --> 37:23.631
This is WBAL TV, Channel 11
in Baltimore, wishing all our viewers...

37:23.741 --> 37:27.186
a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

37:30.957 --> 37:34.059
Merry Christmas, baby

37:35.544 --> 37:39.064
You really did treat me nice

37:44.720 --> 37:47.989
Bought me a hi-fi for Christmas

37:50.351 --> 37:54.037
Now I'm living in paradise

37:55.982 --> 37:58.958
Let's see. It's two more
days till the test.

37:59.193 --> 38:04.599
And if she passes, it's two more days
till the thing. The marriage.

38:04.699 --> 38:06.475
Where are you guys going, Puerto Rico?

38:06.575 --> 38:07.727
No, Cuba.

38:07.827 --> 38:11.772
Cuba, that's nice. My parents' friends,
the Copelands, they go there every year.

38:11.872 --> 38:14.192
- They said it's nice?
- Really nice.

38:14.292 --> 38:16.267
Yeah. Yeah, I heard.

38:18.921 --> 38:23.066
Shrev, are you happy
with your marriage or what?

38:23.634 --> 38:25.077
I don't know.

38:25.177 --> 38:27.737
What do you mean, you don't know?

38:27.847 --> 38:30.082
- You don't know?
- What?

38:30.182 --> 38:33.586
How could you not...? You don't know?
How could you not know?

38:33.686 --> 38:35.578
I don't know.

38:36.439 --> 38:41.292
Beth is terrific and everything,
but Jesus, I don't know.

38:42.695 --> 38:45.556
A big part of the problem
when you get married...

38:45.656 --> 38:48.059
When you're dating...

38:48.159 --> 38:50.645
everything is talking about sex, right?

38:50.745 --> 38:54.523
Where can we do it?
You know, why can't we do it?

38:54.623 --> 38:58.226
Are your parents gonna be out
so we can do it, you know?

38:58.836 --> 39:01.489
Trying to get a weekend
just so that we can do it.

39:01.589 --> 39:02.698
So you can do it.

39:02.798 --> 39:05.952
Everything is just always talking
about getting sex.

39:06.052 --> 39:08.913
And then planning the wedding.

39:09.013 --> 39:10.572
All the details.

39:11.223 --> 39:12.708
Details, shit.

39:12.808 --> 39:17.078
But then, when you get married...

39:17.813 --> 39:21.550
It's crazy, I don't know. I mean,
you can get it whenever you want it.

39:21.650 --> 39:23.803
You wake up in the morning,
and she's there.

39:23.903 --> 39:27.005
And you come home from work,
and she's there.

39:27.239 --> 39:31.185
And so all that sex-planning talk
is over with.

39:31.285 --> 39:34.438
And so is the wedding-planning talk
because you're already married.

39:34.538 --> 39:35.972
Right.

39:37.333 --> 39:42.238
So, you know, I can come down here
and we can bullshit the whole night away.

39:42.338 --> 39:46.534
But I cannot hold
a five-minute conversation with Beth.

39:46.634 --> 39:49.537
It's not her fault. I'm not blaming her.
She's great. It's...

39:49.637 --> 39:51.112
No, of course not.

39:52.139 --> 39:54.782
It's just,
we've got nothing to talk about.

39:57.645 --> 39:59.588
But, it's good, it's good.

39:59.688 --> 40:01.289
It's good?

40:01.774 --> 40:04.093
- It's nice, right?
- Yes.

40:04.193 --> 40:06.544
- It's nice.
- Right.

40:06.821 --> 40:08.296
Right.

40:09.448 --> 40:12.967
Well, you've always got the diner.

40:14.245 --> 40:17.347
Yeah. We've always got the diner.

40:19.708 --> 40:22.685
- But don't worry about it.
- I'm not worried.

40:22.878 --> 40:25.031
- Ahem.
- Don't back out on me.

40:25.131 --> 40:27.649
I'm not gonna back out on you either.

40:28.426 --> 40:32.445
Unless, of course, she fails the test.
It's out of my hands.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.951
Run, run Rudolph
Santa's got to make it to town

40:39.270 --> 40:43.706
Santa make him hurry
Tell him he can take the freeway down

40:45.276 --> 40:48.637
Run, run Rudolph
'Cause I'm reelin' like a merry-go-round

40:53.451 --> 40:57.188
Hey, Boog. Did you hear? They won by 14.

40:57.288 --> 41:00.524
God! They weren't supposed to roll up
that high of a score.

41:00.624 --> 41:03.226
You gonna listen to me next time?

41:17.558 --> 41:21.869
Santa make him hurry
Tell him he can take the freeway down

41:23.939 --> 41:28.376
Run, run Rudolph
Reelin' like a merry-go-round

41:54.803 --> 41:57.039
Come here. Your mother
let you loose like this?

41:57.139 --> 41:59.375
Look at those pants.
I got charcoal pants here.

41:59.475 --> 42:04.213
You want to get inside the diner?
Come here. Look at these. Charcoal gray.

42:04.313 --> 42:06.132
Special sale, 12.50.

42:06.232 --> 42:09.969
- Twelve-fifty? You offered him 7.
- For you, 11.98. These are better.

42:10.069 --> 42:13.514
You think I'll tell him?
Don't tell anybody where you got these.

42:13.614 --> 42:16.142
- How much money have you got?
- Four bucks.

42:16.242 --> 42:19.395
Four bucks? I've got a good shirt
for you. Forget the pants.

42:21.872 --> 42:23.732
- It's incredible.
- Unbelievable.

42:23.832 --> 42:25.391
Where's he now?

42:25.543 --> 42:29.113
He's already up to the Pimlico. Right?
Then he's got the Junction.

42:29.213 --> 42:32.741
And the Avalon and the Garrison.
That's the George's Deluxe in the corner.

42:32.841 --> 42:34.275
Oh, yeah.

42:34.510 --> 42:35.995
You know what that is?

42:36.095 --> 42:40.749
One, two. The whole left side of the menu.
What a triumph if he pulls it off.

42:40.849 --> 42:44.920
You're talking about 15, 16 more
if you include the...

42:45.020 --> 42:49.341
- The Maryland fried-chicken dinner.
- I think he's just talking club sandwiches.

42:49.441 --> 42:52.344
Excuse me, Earl. Does that
include the fried-chicken dinner?

42:52.444 --> 42:54.805
- Yes.
- It does.

42:54.905 --> 42:58.517
Twenty-two deluxe sandwiches
and the fried-chicken dinner.

42:58.617 --> 43:02.062
It's not human. He's not a person.
He's like a building with feet.

43:02.162 --> 43:04.273
You know what I mean? It's unbelievable.

43:04.373 --> 43:06.400
- Not gonna pay you, no.
- It's not fair.

43:06.500 --> 43:10.404
She was supposed to grab your pecker,
not reach into the popcorn and get it.

43:10.504 --> 43:12.531
- Exactly.
- She grabbed my pecker.

43:12.631 --> 43:16.243
Yeah, but Boog, the bet was touch
your pecker, not pecker in popcorn.

43:16.343 --> 43:19.455
That's right. It was pecker-touching
without intention.

43:19.555 --> 43:24.335
I'm not gonna pay you. No.
No, she was supposed to grab your pecker.

43:24.435 --> 43:26.378
- Give me some money.
- I don't buy it.

43:26.478 --> 43:29.757
Yeah. I want it on the up-and-up.
Me too. This one was default.

43:29.857 --> 43:31.425
Let it ride. I'll tell you what.

43:31.525 --> 43:34.845
I'll bet you I can ball Carol Heathrow
on our next date.

43:34.945 --> 43:36.305
Now, you're nuts.

43:36.405 --> 43:37.848
- No.
- Come on, Boog.

43:37.948 --> 43:40.935
- You want to bet me 50 bucks a guy?
- Fifty?

43:41.035 --> 43:44.637
- Yeah.
- It's like stealing money from you, Boog.

43:45.039 --> 43:48.150
- Are you in?
- Yeah, I'm in. I'm in.

43:48.250 --> 43:49.527
- Are you in?
- I'm in.

43:49.627 --> 43:50.945
- Are you in?
- I'm in.

43:51.045 --> 43:52.739
All right.

43:53.339 --> 43:55.533
- Yeah.
- Are you in, Billy?

43:55.633 --> 43:57.233
No, I'm not in.

43:57.676 --> 43:59.995
I'll take all the action I can get.

44:01.023 --> 44:02.331
We need validation.

44:02.431 --> 44:06.085
All right, you want validation?
Okay, you can be there to validate.

44:06.185 --> 44:07.853
Sure.

44:16.612 --> 44:19.390
- Earl is the king.
- The whole left side.

44:19.490 --> 44:22.393
The Portland. I didn't think he
could eat any more than that.

44:22.493 --> 44:25.104
Do you want to look at some desserts?
He's locking up.

44:25.204 --> 44:26.689
Get them now or forget it.

44:26.789 --> 44:30.475
- Can he do it?
- Yes. He's getting in the car.

44:31.293 --> 44:32.987
Good breakfast, Earl.

44:33.087 --> 44:38.033
- Try to keep that down, Earl.
- Standing ovation for the Earl. Standing O.

44:38.133 --> 44:39.650
The car moves.

44:40.302 --> 44:42.195
Don't get in the way.

44:42.471 --> 44:44.947
That was beautiful. Grind them.

44:45.599 --> 44:47.825
Peel some rubber now, Earl.

44:48.185 --> 44:50.963
Let's meet here at 12
and go to the game in my car.

44:51.063 --> 44:54.133
Let's make it quarter to.
I don't want to miss any pre-game crap.

44:54.233 --> 44:57.303
Why don't we just go now?
That way we won't miss anything.

44:57.403 --> 45:00.681
Shrevie. Wait a minute, we're talking
about the championship game.

45:00.781 --> 45:03.726
For Christ's sake, let's get serious.
A quarter to.

45:03.826 --> 45:04.935
- All right?
- Quarter to.

45:05.035 --> 45:07.261
- All right. I'll see you later.
- So long.

45:08.997 --> 45:10.107
You got a ride?

45:10.207 --> 45:12.109
- You going straight home?
- Yeah. Get in.

45:12.209 --> 45:15.154
- It's no problem?
- Modell. Don't give me that. Get in.

45:15.254 --> 45:18.481
You want me to go? I'll go.
Whatever you want.

46:00.466 --> 46:03.067
I got to meet that girl. She is death.

46:06.305 --> 46:08.957
- Very nice.
- Man, I'm in love.

46:09.057 --> 46:11.909
Miss! Whoa, miss!

46:12.728 --> 46:14.912
Whoa, miss?

46:15.355 --> 46:17.248
- Hey, miss.
- Watch the road.

46:23.906 --> 46:25.590
Hold on a second.

46:40.005 --> 46:42.064
I was admiring your horse.

46:42.508 --> 46:43.900
Were you?

46:44.927 --> 46:47.621
Do you ride Western as well?

46:47.721 --> 46:51.365
I do, but I prefer English.
There's a finer sense of control.

46:53.227 --> 46:54.420
What's your name?

46:54.520 --> 46:57.580
Jane Chisholm. As in the Chisholm Trail.

47:02.528 --> 47:05.129
What fucking Chisholm Trail?

47:05.864 --> 47:10.009
Do you ever get the feeling there's
something going on we don't know about?

47:15.624 --> 47:19.185
Do you get the feeling
that she gave me a fake name?

47:31.181 --> 47:34.825
- Do you want to keep driving?
- No. Might as well call it a night.

48:21.732 --> 48:23.916
Is there anything wrong, Barb?

48:24.484 --> 48:26.419
No.

48:28.572 --> 48:31.215
Yes. I think I'm pregnant.

48:44.129 --> 48:45.688
Me?

48:47.215 --> 48:49.150
Yes.

48:51.428 --> 48:55.614
Our one night in New York last month.

48:56.475 --> 49:01.713
Six years of a platonic relationship,
and then that night.

49:01.813 --> 49:04.081
And this happens.

49:06.276 --> 49:09.128
- Maybe it's for the best.
- No.

49:10.447 --> 49:12.757
I don't think so.

49:14.284 --> 49:15.968
Do you want to marry me?

49:17.496 --> 49:19.138
Yes.

49:19.706 --> 49:24.769
Is that why you came back
a few days early? To ask?

49:25.253 --> 49:28.856
Well, I thought after New York,
you know...

49:30.133 --> 49:32.452
Seven weeks is a long time
when you miss someone.

49:32.552 --> 49:34.737
New York was a mistake.

49:36.640 --> 49:42.703
Well, maybe it wasn't as romantic as we'd
like it to be, but I think it will happen.

49:44.231 --> 49:46.957
It isn't perfect yet, but...

49:49.945 --> 49:52.088
I love you, Barb.

49:54.408 --> 50:00.179
You're confusing a friendship
with a woman and love.

50:00.330 --> 50:02.640
It's not the same.

50:08.880 --> 50:10.657
That's the opening whistle
and our game begins.

50:10.757 --> 50:12.910
You're still playing
for a 30-point bonus question.

50:13.010 --> 50:16.371
Here's another toss up in English.
Are you ready?

50:16.471 --> 50:22.044
A spaceship is stranded on the planet
Mercury outside of the libration areas.

50:22.144 --> 50:25.213
It is night, and pitch black outside.

50:25.313 --> 50:29.343
For 10 points, how long must
the explorers wait until sunrise?

50:29.443 --> 50:31.261
Sun doesn't rise on Mercury.

50:31.361 --> 50:32.554
Bryn Mawr. Stebbins.

50:32.654 --> 50:35.349
They won't get a sunrise
because Mercury has one side...

50:35.449 --> 50:38.518
perpetually turned toward the Sun
and the other away from it.

50:38.618 --> 50:42.022
That's right. They would have
to wait forever. That's the answer.

50:42.122 --> 50:43.982
I have a 20-point bonus coming up.

50:44.082 --> 50:49.279
Here's your toss-up. For 10 points:
What would a man probably have...

50:49.379 --> 50:53.909
if he had a visible contusion near the
upper part of his zygomatic arch?

50:54.009 --> 50:56.620
- A black eye.
- A sharp lump on his head.

50:56.720 --> 50:58.237
- No.
- Black eye, you bozo.

50:58.555 --> 50:59.790
Bryn Mawr. Stebbins.

50:59.890 --> 51:03.877
I think, let's see,
he would have a bump here.

51:03.977 --> 51:06.463
You look like you've got a bump
on your head.

51:06.563 --> 51:07.788
A black eye.

51:08.023 --> 51:10.791
All right.
We were looking for a black eye.

51:10.901 --> 51:14.179
But I must accept a bruised cheekbone.
All right.

51:16.740 --> 51:21.677
Yeah, Ma. I know I owe $2000.
Guess what? I heard it before you.

51:22.120 --> 51:23.929
What am I gonna do?

51:24.498 --> 51:28.309
I'm choice. I'm gonna have
to find a way to pay it off.

51:28.418 --> 51:31.228
Me? I've got $56 to my name.

51:32.255 --> 51:34.491
Yeah, I know I'm in trouble.

51:34.591 --> 51:37.661
Then they'll kill me.
What can I tell you?

51:39.012 --> 51:42.833
Here's your toss-up. For 10 points:
What home-grown philosopher said:

51:42.933 --> 51:45.377
- "The masks of men lead lives..."
- Thoreau!

51:45.477 --> 51:47.004
- Cornell. Pearlman.
- Thoreau.

51:47.104 --> 51:49.914
Right, for 10 points.
"Lead lives of quiet..."

51:59.491 --> 52:01.018
That's right, for 10 points.

52:01.118 --> 52:03.562
The statement inscribed
in the US Post Office:

52:03.662 --> 52:06.398
"Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat,
nor gloom of night..."

52:06.498 --> 52:08.316
Herodotus!

52:08.416 --> 52:11.111
For 10 points, what classical author
wrote it?

52:11.211 --> 52:13.687
- Herodotus.
- Right, for 10 points.

52:14.422 --> 52:17.409
Hey, Cornell. Take a walk, you bozo.

52:17.509 --> 52:20.454
The final half, with the score:
Bryn Mawr College, 104...

52:20.554 --> 52:21.997
and Cornell University, 60.

52:22.097 --> 52:24.416
I talked to Shrevie.
Shrevie's gonna lend me 200.

52:24.516 --> 52:25.908
- You going over now?
- Yeah.

52:27.394 --> 52:31.089
I might drop in on my brother, might be
able to get some bucks from the toast.

52:31.189 --> 52:32.831
Howard?

52:33.400 --> 52:34.951
Really?

52:35.443 --> 52:37.095
I appreciate that, Fen.

52:37.195 --> 52:39.213
I know how you guys feel
about each other.

52:41.116 --> 52:45.636
Listen. With the Heathrow bet
I'm gonna be close. I'll see you later.

53:13.857 --> 53:15.416
Beth?

53:17.152 --> 53:18.752
- What?
- Come here.

53:18.862 --> 53:21.348
I'm doing a crossword puzzle.

53:21.448 --> 53:22.923
Come here!

53:24.618 --> 53:28.313
Playin' the fiddle and drinkin' gin

53:28.413 --> 53:29.564
What?

53:29.664 --> 53:31.900
Have you been playing my records?

53:32.000 --> 53:33.443
Yeah. So?

53:33.543 --> 53:36.071
So didn't I tell you the procedure?

53:36.171 --> 53:39.991
Yeah, you told me all about it, Shrevie.
They have to be in alphabetical order.

53:40.091 --> 53:42.109
And what else?

53:43.136 --> 53:47.573
They have to be filed alphabetically
and according to year as well. Okay?

53:48.141 --> 53:49.616
And what else?

53:52.103 --> 53:54.663
- What else?
- I don't know.

53:55.148 --> 53:58.176
You don't know?
Well, let me give you a hint, okay?

53:58.276 --> 54:03.223
I found my James Brown record filed
under the J's, instead of the B's.

54:03.323 --> 54:05.725
I don't know who taught you
to alphabetize.

54:05.825 --> 54:08.770
But to top it off,
he's in the rock 'n' roll section...

54:08.870 --> 54:11.898
instead of the R & B section.
How can you do that?

54:11.998 --> 54:15.735
It's too complicated, Shrevie.
See, every time I pull out a record...

54:15.835 --> 54:18.613
there's this whole procedure
I have to go through.

54:18.713 --> 54:21.116
I just want to hear
the music, that's all.

54:21.216 --> 54:24.536
Is it too complicated to just keep
my records in the category?

54:24.636 --> 54:27.122
Just put the rock 'n' roll
in with the rock 'n' roll.

54:27.222 --> 54:30.750
Put the R & B in with the R & B.

54:30.850 --> 54:34.370
You're not gonna put Charlie Parker
in with the rock 'n' roll, would you?

54:35.730 --> 54:37.007
Would you?

54:37.107 --> 54:40.626
I don't know. Who is Charlie Parker?

54:41.945 --> 54:44.264
Jazz! Jazz!

54:44.364 --> 54:48.602
He was the greatest jazz
saxophone player that ever lived!

54:48.702 --> 54:50.812
What are you getting so crazy about?

54:50.912 --> 54:54.149
It's just music.
It's not that big a deal.

54:54.249 --> 54:58.644
It is. Don't you understand?
This is important to me.

55:00.130 --> 55:02.898
Shrevie, why do you yell at me?

55:04.884 --> 55:07.579
I never hear you yell
at any of your friends.

55:07.679 --> 55:09.831
Look. Pick a record. Okay?

55:09.931 --> 55:12.167
- What?
- Just pick any record.

55:12.267 --> 55:14.336
Any record. Okay.

55:14.436 --> 55:16.078
What's the hit side?

55:18.773 --> 55:20.800
- "Good Golly Miss Molly."
- Okay.

55:20.900 --> 55:24.679
- Now ask me what's on the flip side.
- Why?

55:24.779 --> 55:28.266
Just ask me
what's on the flip side. Okay?

55:28.366 --> 55:29.976
What is on the flip side?

55:30.076 --> 55:35.055
"Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey." 1958.
Specialty Records.

55:36.958 --> 55:42.280
See, you don't ask me things like that.
You never ask me what's on the flip side.

55:42.380 --> 55:45.450
No. Because I don't give a shit.

55:45.550 --> 55:48.370
Who cares about what's on the flip side
of a record?

55:48.470 --> 55:50.538
I do.

55:50.638 --> 55:53.875
Every one of my records means something.

55:53.975 --> 55:57.286
The label. The producer.
The year it was made.

55:57.437 --> 56:00.757
Who was copying whose styles.
Who was expanding on that.

56:00.857 --> 56:02.717
Don't you understand?

56:02.817 --> 56:04.761
When I listen to my records...

56:04.861 --> 56:07.806
they take me back to certain points
in my life. Okay?

56:07.906 --> 56:11.467
Just don't touch my records. Ever.

56:12.952 --> 56:14.729
The first time that I met you...

56:14.829 --> 56:18.817
Modell's sister's high-school
graduation party. Right? 1955.

56:18.917 --> 56:23.061
And "Ain't That A Shame" was playing
when I walked in the door.

57:03.586 --> 57:05.646
- Hi, Boogie.
- How you doing?

57:06.005 --> 57:08.116
- Is Shrevie here?
- No.

57:08.216 --> 57:11.652
He's not here? I called him
a little while ago, he said he'd be in.

57:14.556 --> 57:16.124
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

57:16.224 --> 57:18.992
- Did I come at a bad time?
- No, it's all right.

57:19.352 --> 57:22.589
What's the matter? Maybe I should go.
I'll come back later.

57:22.689 --> 57:25.091
Should I leave? Should I?
What's the matter?

57:25.191 --> 57:27.385
Boogie, does he ever yell at you?

57:27.485 --> 57:31.088
What? What happened, baby?

57:34.367 --> 57:36.227
We had a fight.

57:36.327 --> 57:39.721
- Why did you have a fight?
- I don't know.

57:42.959 --> 57:45.018
Do you want me to talk to him?

57:45.211 --> 57:48.156
- Tell me why you had a fight.
- I don't know...

57:48.256 --> 57:50.816
Come on, don't cry. Come on.

57:50.967 --> 57:54.069
- Come on, baby.
- I did something wrong.

57:54.429 --> 57:57.040
I ain't got a man

57:57.140 --> 57:59.876
I ain't got a son

57:59.976 --> 58:02.712
I ain't got a daughter

58:02.812 --> 58:05.548
I ain't got no one

58:05.648 --> 58:08.468
I'm a lonely girl

58:08.568 --> 58:11.262
I ain't got a home

58:11.362 --> 58:14.047
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

58:14.449 --> 58:17.435
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

58:17.535 --> 58:20.146
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

58:20.246 --> 58:23.024
I ain't got a mother

58:23.124 --> 58:25.819
I ain't got a father

58:25.919 --> 58:28.979
I ain't got a sister

58:29.380 --> 58:32.742
He's in trouble. Don't you know
about friendship, Howard?

58:32.842 --> 58:34.411
Five hundred dollars?

58:34.511 --> 58:38.289
Four hundred, 300.
Whatever you can afford.

58:38.389 --> 58:40.417
Maybe this is a lesson for you.

58:40.517 --> 58:43.702
If you worked,
you'd have some money to lend him.

58:43.811 --> 58:48.049
Yeah, I know. I'm irresponsible.
I dropped out of college.

58:48.149 --> 58:51.010
I won't work in the family business.
I'm a disgrace.

58:51.110 --> 58:54.973
That's a good reason to keep me
out of your house, God knows.

58:55.073 --> 58:56.307
You're a bad example.

58:56.407 --> 59:01.396
Far be it for me to disagree.
Give me some money, Howard.

59:01.496 --> 59:03.013
Do you ever read a book?

59:04.457 --> 59:07.527
- Read. Do you ever read?
- Never.

59:07.627 --> 59:11.448
You should read Dale Carnegie's
How to Win Friends and Influence People.

59:11.548 --> 59:13.315
Give me some money, Howard.

59:13.841 --> 59:15.660
Where'd you get this attitude?

59:15.760 --> 59:19.247
I borrowed it. I have to have it back
by midnight. Howard.

59:19.347 --> 59:22.292
I should talk to Daddy
about stopping your trust fund.

59:22.392 --> 59:24.159
It's killing your initiative.

59:25.228 --> 59:29.132
Some big trust fund.
A hundred dollars a month till I'm 23.

59:29.232 --> 59:32.677
Yeah, Granddad was a real Rockefeller.

59:32.777 --> 59:34.544
Howard.

59:35.071 --> 59:36.723
It's important.

59:36.823 --> 59:38.757
I wouldn't come otherwise.

59:38.908 --> 59:43.387
I don't like to see you, so you know
it's got to be very important.

59:43.997 --> 59:45.398
Get off.

59:45.498 --> 59:48.975
I despise you, and yet I'm here.

59:49.460 --> 59:51.061
Get off.

59:57.093 --> 01:00:01.206
It's funny. You know, when I was
a little kid I always wanted a brother...

01:00:01.306 --> 01:00:04.959
and I told that to Mom once.
And she said, "You have a brother."

01:00:05.059 --> 01:00:09.830
And I said, "Oh, that's who the asshole
in the other bed is."

01:00:14.319 --> 01:00:17.597
If I had my way,
I'd just date Elyse all my life.

01:00:17.697 --> 01:00:19.756
- Hey, watch it, pal.
- Just date her.

01:00:19.949 --> 01:00:21.601
I personally like dating.

01:00:21.701 --> 01:00:24.938
- What are you doing it for?
- I've been dating Elyse for five years.

01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:28.316
I have no choice. You know how girls are.
Security and all that.

01:00:28.416 --> 01:00:32.477
They need that thing,
that marriage thing.

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:40.328
What am I watching?

01:00:40.428 --> 01:00:43.081
The movie just started
and I don't know what's going on.

01:00:43.181 --> 01:00:45.031
It's symbolic.

01:00:52.815 --> 01:00:54.416
Who's that guy?

01:00:55.526 --> 01:00:58.170
That's Death walking on the beach.

01:01:00.365 --> 01:01:05.010
I've been to Atlantic City a hundred times
and I never saw Death walk on the beach.

01:01:16.089 --> 01:01:17.782
Kids.

01:01:17.882 --> 01:01:19.691
Kids did this.

01:01:20.551 --> 01:01:24.613
Oh, tell me, baby

01:01:25.473 --> 01:01:28.668
What's the matter with you?

01:01:28.768 --> 01:01:31.620
It's a sacrilege for Christ's sake.

01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:43.891
Hey, what is this?

01:01:43.991 --> 01:01:45.143
- Come on.
- What's wrong?

01:01:45.243 --> 01:01:46.477
It's an emergency.

01:01:46.577 --> 01:01:48.313
- What's up?
- Fenwick's in the manger.

01:01:48.413 --> 01:01:50.764
- What?
- He's in the manger and he won't leave.

01:01:50.915 --> 01:01:53.308
- Manger?
- I've never seen him like this.

01:01:56.212 --> 01:02:00.106
Oh, little town of Bethlehem

01:02:10.101 --> 01:02:14.079
- This is crazy.
- I told you.

01:02:15.022 --> 01:02:18.301
Three more wise men.
They've heard of the miracle.

01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:22.138
- Let's go, Fen.
- You must have traveled far.

01:02:22.238 --> 01:02:26.351
Come. Come rest your weary feet.

01:02:26.451 --> 01:02:28.102
Come on, Fen. Get out of there.

01:02:28.202 --> 01:02:30.512
Someone'll spot you.
The police are gonna be here.

01:02:30.955 --> 01:02:33.265
Come on, Fen. Put your pants on.

01:02:34.333 --> 01:02:35.777
This.

01:02:35.877 --> 01:02:40.239
This is a big smile. Don't you think?

01:02:40.339 --> 01:02:42.533
Yeah. Yeah, come on.

01:02:42.633 --> 01:02:43.868
Come on.

01:02:43.968 --> 01:02:46.403
- Let's go.
- No! No!

01:02:46.512 --> 01:02:48.539
- Here we go.
- Fen, no! Fen!

01:02:48.639 --> 01:02:51.908
- Eddie, get him.
- Get his arms.

01:02:52.101 --> 01:02:53.994
- Billy.
- Billy, grab him.

01:02:57.023 --> 01:02:59.457
- I got him.
- Keep him. Hold on.

01:03:04.363 --> 01:03:06.808
- Back! Back!
- Fenwick, put the damn sheep down.

01:03:06.908 --> 01:03:09.060
- Put the sheep down.
- Stop screwing around.

01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:13.805
Put the sheep down. We'll pick up
the three wise men and get out of here.

01:03:22.673 --> 01:03:24.524
Police.

01:03:24.884 --> 01:03:28.737
Fortunately, my work is done.

01:03:30.014 --> 01:03:32.407
Nice, Fen. Very nice.

01:03:32.975 --> 01:03:35.785
- What do we do now?
- Choice.

01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:39.205
Thanks, pal.

01:03:45.404 --> 01:03:47.598
I added some killer
questions to the test.

01:03:47.698 --> 01:03:49.925
Tomorrow night's the showdown.

01:03:50.076 --> 01:03:51.676
Is she studying hard?

01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:55.898
Better be. Otherwise,
she's off to Cuba alone.

01:04:03.047 --> 01:04:04.824
Wish I knew what to do about Barbara.

01:04:04.924 --> 01:04:07.734
You get married.
You take her back to school with you.

01:04:07.844 --> 01:04:09.537
You get a part-time job.

01:04:09.637 --> 01:04:13.990
And, you know, by the time you've got
your master's, kid's arrived, all's well.

01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:16.034
Yeah, what about her job?

01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:18.578
Her job?

01:04:20.189 --> 01:04:22.675
Her job...

01:04:22.775 --> 01:04:26.220
I give you an answer and you confuse it
by bringing her into the problem.

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:28.088
Do you want to take a walk?

01:04:30.366 --> 01:04:32.842
Look, Ed. She's in this thing.

01:04:33.035 --> 01:04:34.970
There's two of us, you know?

01:04:35.121 --> 01:04:38.056
She loves her work and...

01:04:38.624 --> 01:04:41.068
she doesn't want to marry me.
That's the bottom line.

01:04:42.545 --> 01:04:45.981
You're dealing with an irrational girl.
That's your problem.

01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:50.953
Look, do you want to find someplace else
to stand, buddy?

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:54.197
You gonna do some thing about it?

01:04:55.224 --> 01:04:57.418
You heard him! Schmuck, back off!

01:04:57.518 --> 01:05:00.161
You gonna do something about it?

01:05:04.775 --> 01:05:09.347
Do you want to fight?
Is that what you want? Come on.

01:05:09.447 --> 01:05:11.756
Come on, you son of a bitch.

01:05:11.949 --> 01:05:15.427
I'll hit you so hard,
I'll kill your whole family.

01:05:29.842 --> 01:05:31.202
What's going on?

01:05:31.302 --> 01:05:32.944
What?

01:05:34.096 --> 01:05:35.498
I've got him right here.

01:05:35.598 --> 01:05:40.044
We called Timmy's father, but he said
he wouldn't post bail until the morning.

01:05:40.144 --> 01:05:42.579
He wants to teach him a lesson.

01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:45.633
We get back from Florida, open the door,
and the police call.

01:05:45.733 --> 01:05:47.552
That's what I call good timing.

01:05:47.652 --> 01:05:50.054
- How's Mom?
- She's fine.

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:59.188
- He was punching out wise men?
- Yeah, he was punching out the wise men.

01:05:59.288 --> 01:06:01.232
He was so drunk I couldn't believe it.

01:06:01.332 --> 01:06:04.902
I can't believe that his father
leaves him in jail overnight.

01:06:05.002 --> 01:06:08.072
He's punching out the wise men
and knocks over the whole manger?

01:06:08.172 --> 01:06:12.535
His family situation is not the best.
Between his father and his brother...

01:06:12.635 --> 01:06:15.737
But why furnish your enemies
with ammunition?

01:06:16.347 --> 01:06:19.083
You're a family man, Harvey.
And someday, God willing...

01:06:19.183 --> 01:06:22.920
you may want to be president.
And there you are, out in the open...

01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:27.383
where any hep person knows that this guy
is toting this guy around with you.

01:06:27.483 --> 01:06:29.760
- Are we kids, or what?
- Get out of here.

01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:33.139
Thanks, J.J., for what I consider
sound advice.

01:06:33.239 --> 01:06:34.974
Would you get out of here?

01:06:35.074 --> 01:06:38.134
- Is he crazy, or am I mistaken?
- He's weird.

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:43.723
Do you think I'm doing the right thing
getting married?

01:06:44.792 --> 01:06:46.518
Eddie, I can't tell you that.

01:06:47.336 --> 01:06:51.397
I keep thinking that I'm gonna
be missing out on things, you know?

01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:55.401
Yeah, well, that's what
marriage is all about.

01:06:58.389 --> 01:07:01.908
But I never did a lot before. You know?

01:07:02.643 --> 01:07:03.785
What?

01:07:05.396 --> 01:07:07.455
I never did a lot of...

01:07:08.357 --> 01:07:10.426
Not a lot of screwing around.

01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:14.295
Some, you know? Of course. A little.

01:07:15.573 --> 01:07:16.756
A little?

01:07:18.159 --> 01:07:19.300
A little.

01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:24.013
You son of a bitch.

01:07:25.249 --> 01:07:27.183
You're a virgin, aren't you?

01:07:30.337 --> 01:07:31.771
Technically.

01:07:33.716 --> 01:07:35.525
Ed...

01:07:37.422 --> 01:07:39.154
You've got a lot to learn.

01:07:43.893 --> 01:07:45.962
Who am I gonna learn it from?

01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:49.455
Elyse? Elyse doesn't know anything.

01:07:52.193 --> 01:07:54.210
We could be in trouble.

01:07:57.239 --> 01:08:00.383
I am thinking of him.

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:04.596
Barbara, this is stupid.
I mean, it's crazy.

01:08:06.832 --> 01:08:09.568
By deserting him before he dies.

01:08:09.668 --> 01:08:12.363
I don't understand you, Barbara.
It's mine as well.

01:08:12.463 --> 01:08:14.782
I have something to say in this as well.
Don't I?

01:08:14.882 --> 01:08:17.692
I'm not talking about
doing anything drastic.

01:08:17.801 --> 01:08:19.703
An abortion, or anything like that.

01:08:19.804 --> 01:08:23.040
- I'm getting the feeling I'm not included.
- Keep your voice down.

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:26.711
Who is it you think you're talking to?
I'm half responsible for this mess.

01:08:26.810 --> 01:08:29.203
Please, don't talk so loud.

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:33.509
I do not think this is the time or place
to talk about this very private matter.

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:35.511
- When is the time?
- You're yelling...

01:08:35.611 --> 01:08:38.379
Why don't we take a 10-minute break?

01:08:47.456 --> 01:08:49.724
Barbara, what are we gonna do?

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:53.019
We've got to talk about this.
We've got to try...

01:08:53.587 --> 01:08:57.439
Would it be easier
just to let time pass?

01:08:59.051 --> 01:09:01.620
He's very, very ill.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:07.367
I can't believe this happened to me.
I'm hardly the adventurous type.

01:09:09.103 --> 01:09:12.798
Somehow it just doesn't seem fair,
and that makes it very difficult.

01:09:12.898 --> 01:09:16.761
Of course it's difficult. Whether it's fair
or not doesn't make difference.

01:09:16.861 --> 01:09:20.755
- It's happened. Got to work it out together.
- I know.

01:09:21.365 --> 01:09:28.064
I know. I have a great
feeling for you, Willy.

01:09:28.163 --> 01:09:30.473
You're my closest friend.

01:09:31.082 --> 01:09:32.902
Barbara, I want you to marry me.

01:09:33.002 --> 01:09:36.072
Is it necessary to talk to him?

01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:40.108
I will not marry you.
Not out of convenience.

01:09:40.676 --> 01:09:43.996
Not because it's the thing to do,
which is what everybody else does.

01:09:44.095 --> 01:09:46.749
Do you think that I'm asking you
to marry me because...

01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:49.450
it's what everybody else does?

01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:56.916
Someday I may change my hairstyle,
but not yet.

01:09:57.985 --> 01:10:01.546
- Okay. Whenever you're ready.
- All right.

01:10:04.491 --> 01:10:08.511
- The style you have looks really good on you.
- Thank you.

01:10:10.998 --> 01:10:12.849
Watch your head.

01:10:15.002 --> 01:10:16.821
Hi, Boog.

01:10:16.921 --> 01:10:18.730
How you doing, Beth?

01:10:19.965 --> 01:10:22.775
- Here's the Post.
- Thank you.

01:10:23.677 --> 01:10:25.037
Is Mr. Andre here?

01:10:25.137 --> 01:10:29.125
No. Mr. Andre, he stepped out
to get some coffee and donuts.

01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:30.918
He'll be back. What's up?

01:10:31.018 --> 01:10:33.879
We're all supposed to have our hair done
for the wedding.

01:10:33.979 --> 01:10:35.631
The bridesmaids, the whole group.

01:10:35.731 --> 01:10:39.176
And I'm in charge to make sure
that Mr. Andre can handle it...

01:10:39.276 --> 01:10:43.806
without any problems. Maybe get some
extra operators or something.

01:10:43.906 --> 01:10:47.226
Yeah, I don't know what he has...
Can you get this?

01:10:47.326 --> 01:10:49.510
I don't know what he has planned.

01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:52.022
You're not gonna go to work that day,
are you?

01:10:52.122 --> 01:10:55.484
No, but I'm sure he's got
something arranged.

01:10:55.584 --> 01:10:58.362
Why don't you, sit down over there
and he'll be right in.

01:10:58.462 --> 01:11:00.063
Okay.

01:11:00.422 --> 01:11:02.815
I'm gonna go out for a second.

01:11:14.895 --> 01:11:19.290
- It's cold out here. I should get my coat.
- Come on. It's not that cold.

01:11:19.608 --> 01:11:21.376
Where are we gonna go?

01:11:21.652 --> 01:11:23.596
Let's go down here to my office.

01:11:23.696 --> 01:11:26.223
- This is your office?
- Yeah.

01:11:29.243 --> 01:11:30.936
Get in.

01:11:31.036 --> 01:11:33.272
- What's the matter?
- You had a payment to make.

01:11:33.372 --> 01:11:34.481
I'm gonna make it.

01:11:34.581 --> 01:11:38.110
You were supposed to make it last night.
Nobody in the office got a call.

01:11:38.210 --> 01:11:41.906
That was a mistake. I forgot.
I've placed some bets tonight.

01:11:42.006 --> 01:11:43.481
I'm gonna have it.

01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:45.951
- Don't bullshit me, Boogie.
- I'm not bullshitting.

01:11:46.051 --> 01:11:47.745
- Don't bullshit me.
- Unh!

01:11:47.845 --> 01:11:49.830
Tank, cut it out. I'm gonna make it.

01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:54.826
Tank, what are you doing?

01:11:56.603 --> 01:11:59.256
Who do you think you're fucking with,
some kid?

01:11:59.356 --> 01:12:00.758
What are you doing?

01:12:00.858 --> 01:12:03.093
Fun and games, a little kids' play
or something?

01:12:03.193 --> 01:12:04.720
- I'll have it.
- I'm not amused.

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:06.931
- I'm not amused. Hear me?
- Don't hit me.

01:12:07.031 --> 01:12:10.267
- Tank, what are you doing?
- No ifs, ands, or buts. All right?

01:12:10.367 --> 01:12:12.718
- I'm gonna have it.
- Tonight.

01:12:15.497 --> 01:12:16.973
Tank, don't...

01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:05.489
Carol. Hey.

01:13:05.589 --> 01:13:07.773
I was just thinking about you.

01:13:09.134 --> 01:13:10.568
What?

01:13:11.553 --> 01:13:13.122
The flu?

01:13:14.515 --> 01:13:17.825
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
That doesn't sound too good.

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:20.453
Yeah.

01:13:22.392 --> 01:13:23.873
A hundred and two?

01:13:24.108 --> 01:13:26.885
Yeah, well listen. All right.

01:13:26.985 --> 01:13:29.253
All right. Take care, and...

01:13:30.364 --> 01:13:31.515
All right.

01:13:31.615 --> 01:13:35.259
Listen, I'll call you back later
and check up on you.

01:13:36.245 --> 01:13:38.596
Okay. Bye-bye.

01:14:06.316 --> 01:14:08.125
You feeling better?

01:14:08.694 --> 01:14:14.048
Yeah, well, I'm not crying.
I think that's about the only improvement.

01:14:17.744 --> 01:14:20.888
Boog, I want to thank you
for last night.

01:14:22.791 --> 01:14:25.476
I guess I just needed someone.

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:31.732
Don't thank me. It was... I don't know.
It just kind of felt like old times, you know?

01:14:32.134 --> 01:14:37.029
Standing in the doorway, I kind of
felt like I was dating you again.

01:14:39.391 --> 01:14:43.379
Boog, when we were dating,
did you care for me?

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:44.912
Sure I did.

01:14:45.564 --> 01:14:48.717
No, I don't mean just because
you could do stuff to me, but...

01:14:48.817 --> 01:14:50.928
But because you really cared.

01:14:51.028 --> 01:14:55.464
Of course, Beth. I mean, there was plenty
of girls around for a quick pop.

01:14:56.783 --> 01:14:58.477
If that's what I wanted.

01:14:58.577 --> 01:15:02.847
But I got to tell you, you were good.

01:15:04.583 --> 01:15:05.859
I was?

01:15:07.671 --> 01:15:09.637
Believe me.

01:15:11.548 --> 01:15:13.608
How would I rate?

01:15:14.551 --> 01:15:17.621
You would rate way up there.

01:15:17.721 --> 01:15:22.827
I mean, because,
I never told you this, but this,

01:15:23.227 --> 01:15:25.838
I often think of the nights
that we spent together.

01:15:25.938 --> 01:15:28.164
I mean, and that was a long time ago.

01:15:29.191 --> 01:15:34.920
You know, I don't have any sense
of myself anymore.

01:15:35.864 --> 01:15:38.424
I don't know what I am.

01:15:41.203 --> 01:15:45.014
- I don't know if I'm pretty or if I'm...
- Oh.

01:15:45.832 --> 01:15:49.185
I just, I have no sense of me anymore.

01:15:51.255 --> 01:15:52.980
Listen.

01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:56.368
I don't know what Shrevie...
I don't know what he doesn't tell you.

01:15:56.468 --> 01:15:58.662
But you don't have anything
to worry about.

01:15:58.762 --> 01:16:01.498
You're a definite looker.
You're a very... Listen to me.

01:16:01.598 --> 01:16:05.993
You're a very sexy lady. You are.

01:16:07.145 --> 01:16:09.121
I think...

01:16:09.898 --> 01:16:12.134
I think maybe we should...

01:16:12.234 --> 01:16:14.335
you know, go out sometime.

01:16:16.446 --> 01:16:18.547
I think we should get together.

01:16:20.576 --> 01:16:24.313
Is, Shrevie gonna go over...

01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:26.523
for Elyse's football test?

01:16:26.623 --> 01:16:28.224
Yeah.

01:16:29.376 --> 01:16:31.102
Well?

01:16:31.962 --> 01:16:33.813
I don't know.

01:16:34.339 --> 01:16:36.232
Are you going?

01:16:37.884 --> 01:16:39.360
No.

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:44.990
What do you think?

01:16:48.812 --> 01:16:51.664
Maybe we can go out tonight, Boog?

01:16:54.693 --> 01:16:56.335
Yeah.

01:16:59.156 --> 01:17:00.756
Yeah, we...

01:17:01.825 --> 01:17:04.593
We can get together.

01:17:04.995 --> 01:17:06.595
Okay.

01:17:09.374 --> 01:17:13.269
Was George Shaw
a first-round draft choice?

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:15.030
Five, seven.

01:17:15.130 --> 01:17:17.648
First-round draft choice? True.

01:17:17.799 --> 01:17:20.067
Wrong. He was a bonus pick.

01:17:20.218 --> 01:17:22.996
Elyse, did you study?

01:17:23.096 --> 01:17:27.584
Okay. That concludes the true-and-false
section of the test.

01:17:27.684 --> 01:17:30.128
Let me get the short-answer
stuff in order.

01:17:30.228 --> 01:17:32.089
- Can I have a glass of water?
- No.

01:17:32.189 --> 01:17:33.914
How's she doing?

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:38.804
Elyse has about a 72 so far.
But she's hitting a bad streak.

01:17:38.904 --> 01:17:42.432
Before the Cleveland Browns joined
the NFL, they were in another league.

01:17:42.532 --> 01:17:43.924
What was it called?

01:17:44.826 --> 01:17:46.311
Browns were in another league?

01:17:46.411 --> 01:17:48.313
- Yes, they were.
- I don't know.

01:17:48.413 --> 01:17:50.315
This is hot. You have anything cold?

01:17:50.415 --> 01:17:53.068
Elyse, don't get too close
to the answer sheet. Okay?

01:17:53.168 --> 01:17:56.363
- What's it now, Shrev?
- Let me see.

01:17:56.463 --> 01:17:58.606
What, passing is 65?

01:17:59.049 --> 01:18:00.742
No. Passing is 65.

01:18:00.842 --> 01:18:05.789
Buddy Young played for a team
that no longer exists.

01:18:05.889 --> 01:18:08.657
What was the name of that team?

01:18:11.770 --> 01:18:14.715
- Anybody know that?
- Not a chance.

01:18:14.815 --> 01:18:19.303
- The New York Yankees football team.
- The New York Yankees football team?

01:18:19.403 --> 01:18:22.973
They also were part
of the All-American Football Conference.

01:18:23.073 --> 01:18:25.216
I contributed that question.

01:18:27.661 --> 01:18:33.233
What was the longest run from scrimmage
by a rookie in his first game?

01:18:33.333 --> 01:18:34.443
Alan Ameche.

01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:37.112
Hey! We heard that in here.

01:18:37.212 --> 01:18:39.865
I'm disqualifying this question.

01:18:39.965 --> 01:18:42.909
I knew that. Seventy-nine
yard run, opening day 1955.

01:18:43.009 --> 01:18:44.578
Good, Shrevie. You blew that.

01:18:44.678 --> 01:18:47.956
I'm sorry. I got excited. It's one
of the few questions that I knew.

01:18:48.056 --> 01:18:49.416
Sorry, Elyse.

01:18:49.516 --> 01:18:51.659
- How many more?
- I don't know. I lost count.

01:18:52.728 --> 01:18:55.339
Elyse's mother is on the phone.
How's she doing?

01:18:55.439 --> 01:18:57.466
The guys think it could go either way.

01:18:57.566 --> 01:18:59.917
Either way. Okay.

01:19:01.486 --> 01:19:05.557
- Can I go to the bathroom?
- No. Okay. The Colts signed him.

01:19:05.657 --> 01:19:08.226
A Heisman Trophy winner
who decided to play in Canada.

01:19:08.326 --> 01:19:11.637
Now, however, he plays for the team.
What's his name?

01:19:12.038 --> 01:19:14.107
Heisman Trophy winner.

01:19:14.207 --> 01:19:16.026
- L.G. Dupre.
- No. Billy Vessels.

01:19:16.126 --> 01:19:18.570
- I should've known that.
- Should-ofs don't count.

01:19:18.670 --> 01:19:21.448
Vessels. Out of Oklahoma.

01:19:21.548 --> 01:19:25.285
- She could have racked up points on that one.
- I have no idea what the score is.

01:19:25.385 --> 01:19:28.205
You want to bet she goes down
for the count?

01:19:28.305 --> 01:19:32.199
Last question. The Colts had
a team here, lost the franchise...

01:19:32.350 --> 01:19:33.877
then got one from Dallas.

01:19:33.977 --> 01:19:36.797
What were the colors
of the original Colt team?

01:19:36.897 --> 01:19:39.299
Ooh. Ball buster.

01:19:39.399 --> 01:19:41.718
- The original colors?
- My mother quizzed me on this.

01:19:41.818 --> 01:19:43.627
Also my question.

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:48.141
- Green and gray.
- Right.

01:19:49.451 --> 01:19:50.894
Whoa. What a scrapper.

01:19:50.994 --> 01:19:53.146
A tough question and she pulls it
out of the bag.

01:19:53.246 --> 01:19:55.524
- Very impressive.
- Okay. Total's coming up.

01:19:55.624 --> 01:19:59.403
True and false, 72.

01:19:59.503 --> 01:20:02.239
Killer choices. Very confusing.

01:20:02.339 --> 01:20:04.607
Short answer, 64.

01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:07.860
- What do you think?
- I don't know. Pick them.

01:20:08.512 --> 01:20:12.114
- Cliffhanger.
- The total is 63.

01:20:12.682 --> 01:20:14.000
Sixty-three.

01:20:14.100 --> 01:20:17.212
- I think you better check that again.
- Two points.

01:20:17.312 --> 01:20:19.047
I checked the figures thoroughly.

01:20:19.147 --> 01:20:21.633
- What do you think he'll do?
- He'll give them to her.

01:20:21.733 --> 01:20:23.927
Good sportsmanship is worth two points.

01:20:24.027 --> 01:20:28.714
Eddie, what about the Alan
Ameche question? I knew that one.

01:20:31.243 --> 01:20:33.552
The marriage is off.

01:20:48.844 --> 01:20:50.527
Hi.

01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:55.751
- Where are we going?
- We'll go to Fenwick's apartment.

01:20:55.851 --> 01:20:58.661
Hey, listen. Put this on.

01:21:00.939 --> 01:21:03.967
- What's that for?
- I don't know. In case somebody sees us.

01:21:04.067 --> 01:21:07.753
They'll think you're Carol Heathrow
or somebody like that.

01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:12.132
It's the craziest thing.

01:21:17.706 --> 01:21:19.431
How does it look?

01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:22.226
You look good.

01:21:22.878 --> 01:21:25.104
Okay. Let's go.

01:21:30.510 --> 01:21:34.122
I gave him the questions. What's this jazz?
They were wonderful questions.

01:21:34.222 --> 01:21:35.457
Go drive your truck.

01:21:35.557 --> 01:21:38.409
Ask your son if they weren't
wonderful questions.

01:21:38.810 --> 01:21:42.005
- I was just trying to have some fun.
- Don't raise your voice.

01:21:42.105 --> 01:21:46.834
- I don't want you to raise your voice...
- How did I know it would end up like this?

01:21:48.153 --> 01:21:51.556
- Going to the diner. Want to go?
- I got to validate the Heathrow bet.

01:21:51.656 --> 01:21:53.308
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

01:21:53.408 --> 01:21:55.676
Do you mind if I go with you?

01:21:56.328 --> 01:21:59.346
Come on. I'm not gonna make any noise.

01:21:59.623 --> 01:22:02.683
- It's a small closet. You've got to be still.
- Okay.

01:22:02.876 --> 01:22:04.277
Okay, let's take my car.

01:22:04.377 --> 01:22:06.729
No. Let's take mine. Get some fresh air.

01:22:07.130 --> 01:22:10.816
Let's put the top up.
It's freezing out here.

01:22:15.305 --> 01:22:17.781
- Let's go.
- Okay.

01:22:18.433 --> 01:22:21.827
- Let's go. Let's fly.
- Okay, Shrev. All right.

01:22:23.647 --> 01:22:26.248
Any forward gear will do here.

01:22:28.526 --> 01:22:31.388
Beth would kill me if she knew
what I was doing.

01:22:34.115 --> 01:22:37.269
She goes with all the guys
From outta my class

01:22:37.369 --> 01:22:40.647
But that can't stop me
From a-thinkin' to myself

01:22:40.747 --> 01:22:44.600
She's sure fine-lookin' man
She's something else

01:22:49.255 --> 01:22:52.316
Hey, look a-there, across the street

01:22:53.051 --> 01:22:57.122
There's a car made just for me
To own that car would be a luxury

01:22:57.222 --> 01:22:58.415
"My Prayer"?

01:22:58.515 --> 01:23:02.043
Flip side, "Heaven on Earth," recorded
by The Platters for Mercury Records.

01:23:02.143 --> 01:23:05.088
- Color of the label, maroon. Another.
- "I'm Stickin' With You"?

01:23:05.188 --> 01:23:08.133
"I'm Stickin' With You."
Flip side is "Ever Lovin' Fingers."

01:23:08.233 --> 01:23:11.595
Recorded by Jimmy Bowen
for Roulette Records.

01:23:11.695 --> 01:23:14.671
Color of the label is orange. All right.

01:23:14.823 --> 01:23:16.099
- "Donna"?
- "Donna."

01:23:16.199 --> 01:23:18.852
- Flip side?
- I thought "Donna" was the flip side.

01:23:18.952 --> 01:23:20.312
It's "La Bamba."

01:23:20.412 --> 01:23:22.939
Oh, la, la, la, la, la, la bamba

01:23:23.039 --> 01:23:25.349
Ba, da, da, da, da, la bamba

01:24:05.331 --> 01:24:08.684
- Come on, I'll crouch. You stand.
- Fine.

01:24:12.464 --> 01:24:14.282
- All right?
- That'll be good.

01:24:14.382 --> 01:24:15.575
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:24:15.675 --> 01:24:17.160
- Can you see?
- Yeah.

01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:18.453
I'm okay.

01:24:18.553 --> 01:24:22.114
- Let's leave it open. I'm claustrophobic.
- Come on, Shrev.

01:24:24.559 --> 01:24:28.162
- I should have taken my coat off too.
- Take it off. It's a closet.

01:24:47.082 --> 01:24:48.841
Oh, God.

01:24:49.667 --> 01:24:51.235
She's beautiful.

01:24:59.427 --> 01:25:01.820
All right, you're good? That's good?

01:25:02.722 --> 01:25:06.626
You're gonna have to be real quiet
when we get inside. No talking.

01:25:06.726 --> 01:25:09.786
I think you're being
a little paranoid, Boog.

01:25:10.772 --> 01:25:13.707
The walls are very, very thin.
You promise?

01:25:14.359 --> 01:25:16.126
Okay.

01:25:20.156 --> 01:25:22.090
Did you leave the door open?

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:23.852
What door?

01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:26.146
Don't worry.

01:25:26.246 --> 01:25:27.856
What's going on? Come on, man.

01:25:27.956 --> 01:25:30.057
They should be here by now.

01:25:30.583 --> 01:25:34.394
- Boog, what are you talking about?
- Bet or no bet, it's not right.

01:25:35.338 --> 01:25:39.066
Boog? Boog, what are you talking about?

01:25:39.717 --> 01:25:41.318
Where are they?

01:25:42.053 --> 01:25:43.621
They're taking their time.

01:25:43.721 --> 01:25:45.248
I wonder what's happening.

01:25:45.348 --> 01:25:48.408
- Come on, Boog.
- I think we're missing the show.

01:25:56.985 --> 01:25:59.544
So I was supposed to be Carol Heathrow?

01:26:00.738 --> 01:26:02.923
That's right.

01:26:03.533 --> 01:26:05.894
It was a sick thing to do.

01:26:05.994 --> 01:26:07.427
I'm sorry.

01:26:24.512 --> 01:26:26.280
Thanks, Boog.

01:26:27.599 --> 01:26:29.116
What for?

01:26:29.684 --> 01:26:34.371
You had enough respect for me
to call it off. That says a lot.

01:26:35.064 --> 01:26:38.959
Look. I think you and Shrevie
should try to work out your thing.

01:26:39.277 --> 01:26:41.753
Yeah. I just wish I knew what to do.

01:26:44.032 --> 01:26:46.300
Yeah, I don't know. It's like...

01:26:48.828 --> 01:26:53.108
This kind of problem with a girl,
I'm not too good about talking about it.

01:26:53.208 --> 01:26:57.987
But, I mean, you know me. If I
have a problem with a girl, I just split.

01:26:58.087 --> 01:27:01.857
But I think you and Shrevie
should work your thing out.

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:05.152
I think it would be worth it.

01:27:06.679 --> 01:27:12.159
Boog, when I came into the beauty parlor
this morning, and you said all those things...

01:27:12.644 --> 01:27:14.286
were you lying?

01:27:17.649 --> 01:27:20.292
You'll always rate right up there.

01:27:25.615 --> 01:27:28.300
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay.

01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:38.852
What are you going to do
about the money?

01:27:39.754 --> 01:27:41.480
I don't know.

01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:46.109
Come on, Boog. Don't let us down, buddy.

01:27:46.844 --> 01:27:48.445
Come on.

01:27:49.097 --> 01:27:52.824
We're missing all the action.
I'll bet he's getting her in hallway.

01:27:57.272 --> 01:27:59.257
Can we have a couple more beers
over here?

01:27:59.357 --> 01:28:01.467
Do you remember copping a feel?

01:28:01.767 --> 01:28:05.545
How could I forget?
Boogie was the first. Seventh grade.

01:28:05.947 --> 01:28:07.724
So...

01:28:07.824 --> 01:28:10.226
When I took out Ruth Ray,
I figured I had to do it.

01:28:10.326 --> 01:28:12.520
- Ruth Ray, eighth grade.
- Right.

01:28:12.620 --> 01:28:17.317
Sat on the... Sat on the couch
in her club cellar for hours...

01:28:17.417 --> 01:28:20.236
trying to figure out
a way to get my arm around her.

01:28:20.336 --> 01:28:22.906
Finally, I learned the move.

01:28:23.006 --> 01:28:24.564
Do you know the move?

01:28:24.674 --> 01:28:27.327
I yawned and put my arm
around her shoulder.

01:28:27.427 --> 01:28:30.580
Then... Man, was I young.

01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:34.751
Then came the big task
of getting my hand down to her breast.

01:28:34.851 --> 01:28:37.837
By the time, you know,
I got the nerve to move down...

01:28:37.937 --> 01:28:40.048
I realized my arm was asleep.

01:28:40.148 --> 01:28:41.341
- No?
- Yeah.

01:28:41.441 --> 01:28:45.428
There wasn't time enough to take it away,
get the feeling again, and start over.

01:28:45.528 --> 01:28:48.181
I had to be in by 11.
Time was running out.

01:28:48.781 --> 01:28:52.852
The breast was moved toward,
with my arm asleep.

01:28:53.457 --> 01:28:55.887
My first copping a feel was like this.

01:28:57.999 --> 01:28:59.901
That doesn't even count.

01:29:00.001 --> 01:29:02.528
Then I see the guys. You were there.

01:29:02.628 --> 01:29:05.114
They say, "Did you cop a feel?"

01:29:05.214 --> 01:29:09.244
I said, "Yeah." The guys said,
"How was it?" I said, "Great."

01:29:09.344 --> 01:29:12.455
Do you mean to tell me that
you never copped a feel from Ruth Ray?

01:29:12.555 --> 01:29:14.823
- No.
- You lied to me?

01:29:15.058 --> 01:29:17.451
- I ought to kill you.
- You believed me.

01:29:18.186 --> 01:29:20.171
I was dumb.

01:29:23.775 --> 01:29:26.293
And you believed me, you dick.

01:29:29.781 --> 01:29:33.758
Yeah, the whole thing
with girls is painful.

01:29:34.327 --> 01:29:38.388
And it seems like it keeps getting
more painful instead of easier.

01:29:43.044 --> 01:29:45.353
Hey, Boog's here.

01:29:53.304 --> 01:29:55.197
Hey, Boog.

01:29:55.681 --> 01:29:59.085
Hey. Where were you tonight?
We missed you Boog.

01:29:59.185 --> 01:30:01.077
Yeah. You chicken out?

01:30:02.772 --> 01:30:04.581
Yep, I chickened out.

01:30:06.567 --> 01:30:09.794
Listen, Boog.
I think you should get out of here.

01:30:09.904 --> 01:30:11.306
Tank's inside.

01:30:11.406 --> 01:30:14.466
Yeah, why don't you
wait out here till he splits?

01:30:17.161 --> 01:30:20.013
No, he's just gonna catch up with me
sooner or later.

01:30:22.166 --> 01:30:26.144
I mean the hand's dealt.
I might as well just play the cards.

01:30:30.425 --> 01:30:34.537
What do you think we should do,
in case something happens?

01:30:34.637 --> 01:30:36.404
I don't know.

01:30:46.941 --> 01:30:48.750
Boog.

01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:51.179
How are you doing, Tank?

01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:53.004
You're a lucky man, Boog.

01:30:54.031 --> 01:30:56.142
Yeah. Is that so?

01:30:56.242 --> 01:31:01.680
This donkey in here, Bagel,
he paid your whole tab.

01:31:04.667 --> 01:31:06.944
Bagel paid the money that I owe you?

01:31:07.044 --> 01:31:09.646
Yeah, Boog.
You're straight, like an arrow.

01:31:12.091 --> 01:31:14.285
Shame, shame.

01:31:14.385 --> 01:31:16.403
- Hey, Tank.
- Yeah?

01:31:19.515 --> 01:31:21.283
All right, Boogie!

01:31:21.934 --> 01:31:24.202
- Whoo!
- I owed you that.

01:31:25.104 --> 01:31:27.715
- What a punch, ladies and gentlemen.
- Yeah, Boog.

01:31:27.815 --> 01:31:30.301
- Nice punch. He put him down.
- Nice going.

01:31:30.401 --> 01:31:34.305
Smile of the week.
Definitely the smile of the week.

01:31:34.405 --> 01:31:37.173
- What do you say, George?
- Nothing.

01:31:42.079 --> 01:31:45.849
Thanks a lot, Bagel.
I really appreciate it.

01:31:46.417 --> 01:31:47.944
Your mother called me.

01:31:48.044 --> 01:31:50.687
- She did?
- Yeah. She was hysterical.

01:31:51.088 --> 01:31:53.898
So, you know, out of respect
for your father.

01:31:55.468 --> 01:31:59.622
Your mother told me you're just
wasting your time in law school.

01:31:59.722 --> 01:32:01.406
It's not for you. What do you say?

01:32:02.183 --> 01:32:04.127
Yeah, well, she's probably right.

01:32:04.727 --> 01:32:06.754
So why don't you come work for me?

01:32:06.854 --> 01:32:09.173
Boog, you can't imagine...

01:32:09.273 --> 01:32:12.051
how much money there is to be made
in home-improvement.

01:32:12.151 --> 01:32:15.629
And I can't think of anybody
who'd do it better than you would.

01:32:17.490 --> 01:32:21.978
Well, I'll tell you. You know,
I was only going to law school...

01:32:22.078 --> 01:32:24.422
as a come-on for the girls.

01:32:25.122 --> 01:32:26.399
They like that.

01:32:26.499 --> 01:32:29.809
- Do they like it a lot?
- Yeah. They like it.

01:32:30.294 --> 01:32:33.897
I mean, what the hell?
You know, I could lie.

01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:40.737
Hey, Florence, could I have some
French fries with gravy, please?

01:32:41.305 --> 01:32:45.075
We'll call the $2000 an advance?

01:32:48.646 --> 01:32:50.538
Okay.

01:32:51.691 --> 01:32:54.834
Okay, but I've got
to tell you something, Bagel.

01:32:55.152 --> 01:32:58.973
I'll work with you for a little while
until we square it off.

01:32:59.073 --> 01:33:02.300
But, you know I got plans.

01:33:03.202 --> 01:33:05.136
Always a dreamer, hey, Boog?

01:33:06.664 --> 01:33:10.350
If you don't have good dreams, Bagel,
you got nightmares.

01:33:17.592 --> 01:33:20.369
I'll tell you one thing that happens
when you get married.

01:33:20.469 --> 01:33:22.654
You have to give up your old friends.

01:33:22.763 --> 01:33:25.541
Because the wife wants you
to get new friends.

01:33:25.641 --> 01:33:26.991
And new friends?

01:33:27.977 --> 01:33:31.255
Nope. Because you and me, buddy...

01:33:31.355 --> 01:33:33.665
we got secrets she'll never know.

01:33:34.025 --> 01:33:38.054
Never know. Those new friends
could never be as good.

01:33:38.154 --> 01:33:39.347
Nope.

01:33:39.447 --> 01:33:43.049
Because we've... We've got a history.

01:33:44.076 --> 01:33:45.385
A history.

01:33:47.538 --> 01:33:50.557
It won't change, Ed. Only if you let it.

01:33:52.627 --> 01:33:55.645
This is getting me crazy. Come on.
Pick it up, you guys.

01:34:02.261 --> 01:34:04.080
You want to pick up the beat?

01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:07.333
- Be quiet or we'll get thrown out.
- You gonna pick up the beat?

01:34:07.433 --> 01:34:09.826
You gonna pick up the beat?

01:34:41.634 --> 01:34:43.860
It's classical.

01:35:01.195 --> 01:35:03.213
That's crazy, man.

01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:18.686
I'll pay for it. No problem.

01:35:20.881 --> 01:35:22.899
My buddy!

01:35:30.766 --> 01:35:32.992
- All right. All right.
- That's better.

01:35:44.238 --> 01:35:46.464
Come on, honey. You can shake it.

01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:17.732
Billy, you've got magic fingers.

01:37:17.832 --> 01:37:20.308
A regular Fats Domino.

01:37:32.054 --> 01:37:33.289
Hold on a second.

01:37:33.389 --> 01:37:35.374
Come on. Come on.
First joke you remember.

01:37:35.474 --> 01:37:38.669
All right. All right. Okay.

01:37:38.769 --> 01:37:42.288
Fifth grade, Junior Scholastic Magazine.

01:37:43.023 --> 01:37:47.470
Okay. Hickory dickory doc.
The mouse ran up the clock.

01:37:47.570 --> 01:37:51.174
The clock struck one, and the other two
escaped with minor injuries.

01:37:51.574 --> 01:37:52.975
- Boo. Boo.
- Minor...

01:37:53.075 --> 01:37:54.185
Boo.

01:37:54.285 --> 01:37:57.104
- That's terrible.
- Fifth-grade humor.

01:37:57.204 --> 01:38:00.682
Since then, it's moved up
to the sixth grade. Is that it?

01:38:06.171 --> 01:38:08.949
- You're all right.
- You guys have really made my night.

01:38:09.049 --> 01:38:11.243
You should come down
and hang out more often.

01:38:11.343 --> 01:38:13.695
I can't. I'm getting married.

01:38:14.597 --> 01:38:18.167
She would have gotten that Alan Ameche
question that Shrev screwed up.

01:38:18.267 --> 01:38:21.045
- Benefit of the doubt.
- Exactly.

01:38:21.145 --> 01:38:22.996
I love weddings.

01:38:23.647 --> 01:38:28.093
I just never found the time to settle,
or even wanted to.

01:38:28.193 --> 01:38:30.221
And you?

01:38:30.321 --> 01:38:31.472
No marriage.

01:38:31.572 --> 01:38:33.339
Got a girl?

01:38:34.241 --> 01:38:37.144
Not really. Just in love.

01:38:37.244 --> 01:38:40.397
- Does the girl know?
- Yeah, I told her about it.

01:38:40.497 --> 01:38:42.274
Told her.

01:38:42.374 --> 01:38:44.475
Didn't you show her?

01:39:14.531 --> 01:39:15.631
Come on.

01:39:31.757 --> 01:39:33.149
Nice morning.

01:39:33.384 --> 01:39:35.276
Yes, it is.

01:39:36.136 --> 01:39:39.614
Mornings, I've often felt,
are a nice time to ride.

01:39:40.891 --> 01:39:44.118
- Do you live around here?
- Well, not around here. Here.

01:39:44.979 --> 01:39:47.747
Which means, you're trespassing.

01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:51.334
- I'm just waiting for an invite.
- So let's ride.

01:39:51.694 --> 01:39:54.128
- What's your name?
- Boogie.

01:39:54.238 --> 01:39:56.923
- Boogie?
- Bobby Sheftell.

01:40:15.384 --> 01:40:17.652
Isn't she beautiful?

01:40:26.020 --> 01:40:29.330
- What is that music?
- It's the Colts' marching song.

01:40:29.898 --> 01:40:33.209
It's very tasteful. Very tasteful.

01:40:41.452 --> 01:40:46.440
In the presence of this company
as witness, you have spoken the words...

01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:50.861
and performed the rites
which unite your lives.

01:40:50.961 --> 01:40:56.492
I therefore declare, you Edward,
and you Elyse...

01:40:56.592 --> 01:40:58.818
husband and wife.

01:40:59.887 --> 01:41:04.124
And now I ask you,
and all your dear ones here...

01:41:04.224 --> 01:41:06.826
to bow your heads in reverence.

01:41:07.561 --> 01:41:11.632
Silently, let us pray,
that God will bless your home...

01:41:11.732 --> 01:41:15.928
and help you to achieve
your highest hopes.

01:41:16.028 --> 01:41:17.888
Amen.

01:41:17.988 --> 01:41:20.307
One, two, one, two, three.

01:41:20.407 --> 01:41:23.384
- One, two, one, two, three.
- One...

01:41:24.453 --> 01:41:26.897
- You look very pretty.
- Thank you.

01:41:26.997 --> 01:41:29.098
Blue becomes you.

01:41:31.168 --> 01:41:34.905
Hey, I made us some reservations...

01:41:35.005 --> 01:41:37.032
for the summer in the Poconos.

01:41:37.132 --> 01:41:38.524
For how long?

01:41:38.675 --> 01:41:41.120
I think we might go for 10 days.

01:41:41.220 --> 01:41:43.613
Ten days is good, yeah.

01:42:05.077 --> 01:42:07.803
I'm thinking of going to Europe.

01:42:09.039 --> 01:42:12.600
Why don't you stay in the United States
and just travel around?

01:42:13.127 --> 01:42:18.231
I don't know. It's been done. Europe.
Europe looks like a smile.

01:42:21.927 --> 01:42:24.111
Yes, I'll have my master's in business.

01:42:25.389 --> 01:42:28.115
And then, I guess I'll come back.

01:42:28.809 --> 01:42:33.338
Blue moon

01:42:33.438 --> 01:42:36.717
You saw me standing alone

01:42:36.817 --> 01:42:39.794
Every time we go to a wedding,
we got to listen to this guy.

01:42:39.945 --> 01:42:44.391
Without a dream in my heart

01:42:44.491 --> 01:42:47.853
Yeah, I'll visit you, of course.
I'm not moving to another country.

01:42:47.953 --> 01:42:51.806
Please come back soon.
I'll make you sandwiches. All right?

01:42:54.877 --> 01:42:59.448
Blue moon

01:42:59.548 --> 01:43:04.402
You knew just what I was there for

01:43:06.263 --> 01:43:09.917
You heard me saying a prayer for

01:43:10.017 --> 01:43:12.628
Gonna get some hors d'oeuvres.
Would you like anything?

01:43:12.728 --> 01:43:16.622
Yeah, Bobby. Can I have a few more
of whatever these are?

01:43:18.442 --> 01:43:20.668
They're good. Thank you.

01:43:32.581 --> 01:43:34.223
Hi, boys.

01:43:36.251 --> 01:43:38.612
Hello, test.

01:43:38.712 --> 01:43:43.659
I don't want to bother you.
I just wanted to say a few words.

01:43:43.759 --> 01:43:46.495
I didn't prepare anything or anything.

01:43:46.595 --> 01:43:50.374
The guys told me to come up
and say a few words.

01:43:50.474 --> 01:43:55.879
I was thinking that, you know,
now that Eddie's getting married...

01:43:55.979 --> 01:43:59.290
and he won't really be hanging out
with the guys anymore...

01:43:59.441 --> 01:44:02.970
I just wanted to say that we were
never really that crazy about you.

01:44:03.070 --> 01:44:05.046
I'll be quite honest.

01:44:05.197 --> 01:44:09.467
I didn't want to tell you sooner
because you're a sensitive person.

01:44:10.077 --> 01:44:14.648
I just want to thank everybody
who's responsible for your being here.

01:44:14.748 --> 01:44:19.695
Elyse, I don't know if everybody knows what
Elyse had to go through to get married.

01:44:19.795 --> 01:44:24.116
She was two points away from spending
the rest of her life by herself.

01:44:24.216 --> 01:44:26.285
It was very... It was sad.

01:44:26.385 --> 01:44:30.289
And now she knows more about football
than most girls in America.

01:44:30.389 --> 01:44:32.708
It's important, it really is.

01:44:32.808 --> 01:44:39.298
I mean, we all know most marriages depend
on a firm grasp of football trivia.

01:44:42.401 --> 01:44:45.637
Eddie gets crazy sometimes with sports.
I don't know if you know him.

01:44:45.737 --> 01:44:49.715
I mean, it's one thing to dress the room
in blue and white, with banners...

01:44:49.950 --> 01:44:53.478
and the cake in the shape of a football.
It was a little too much.

01:44:53.578 --> 01:44:56.398
I thought it was out of line
when Eddie asked the rabbi...

01:44:56.498 --> 01:45:01.018
to wear black and white stripes
and a whistle. That was wrong.

01:45:02.462 --> 01:45:07.942
So, Eddie's mother, I know,
is very upset that he's leaving the house.

01:46:12.908 --> 01:46:14.476
Would you look at this?

01:46:14.576 --> 01:46:17.312
Another article talking
about this theory of evolution.

01:46:17.412 --> 01:46:18.855
Can I have the "Sports" page?

01:46:18.955 --> 01:46:21.233
Do you believe this?
I don't buy the whole thing.

01:46:21.333 --> 01:46:24.903
They're saying that millions of
years ago there was a swamp.

01:46:25.003 --> 01:46:26.488
I don't want to hear it.

01:46:26.588 --> 01:46:28.740
In the middle of
this murky, disgusting...

01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:30.951
boggy water swamp, there's an amoeba.

01:46:31.051 --> 01:46:32.744
This amoeba meets another amoeba...

01:46:32.844 --> 01:46:35.580
and they have a kid who's a fish
who crawls onto land.

01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:38.125
And from one lousy amoeba
millions of years ago...

01:46:38.225 --> 01:46:42.546
that today there's some guy with
a winter coat on a corner yelling "Taxi!"

01:46:42.646 --> 01:46:44.965
Where's that connection?
How can that possibly be?

01:46:45.065 --> 01:46:47.884
- An amoeba has no legs.
- Why do you care how we evolved?

01:46:47.984 --> 01:46:50.002
They can float.

01:46:50.654 --> 01:46:53.432
- We're all animals.
- You're gonna argue this with him?

01:46:53.532 --> 01:46:56.435
It's not just people. It's not
even animals, chickens, come on.

01:46:56.535 --> 01:46:59.313
- How could chickens live in a swamp?
- That's ridiculous.

01:46:59.413 --> 01:47:01.815
They can't even make it
out of a pot of frying oil.

01:47:01.915 --> 01:47:05.277
Think of chickens, dogs, birds, cows,
little Cocker Spaniel puppies...

01:47:05.377 --> 01:47:08.196
living in a muddy swamp.
It's enough to make you sick.

01:47:08.296 --> 01:47:11.450
Girls don't come from the
same swamp, that's for sure.

01:47:11.550 --> 01:47:13.869
I don't know who makes up this stuff.

01:47:13.969 --> 01:47:17.873
It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
People do not come from swamps.

01:47:17.973 --> 01:47:20.241
They come from Europe.

01:47:22.310 --> 01:47:26.340
- Where do people in Europe come from?
- What am I? Rand McNally? It's...

01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:28.642
Ba-da-boom.

01:47:28.942 --> 01:47:31.178
Let me ask you something personal.

01:47:31.278 --> 01:47:32.387
Sure.

01:47:32.487 --> 01:47:34.348
Is it true you took out Arlene Stanton?

01:47:35.782 --> 01:47:37.601
- You heard that?
- Yeah.

01:47:37.701 --> 01:47:39.269
Get out of here. Of course not.

01:47:39.369 --> 01:47:41.730
Come on. You touched Arlene.

01:47:41.830 --> 01:47:44.399
- Would you look at her? Would you...?
- Would you?

01:47:44.499 --> 01:47:46.360
You're embarrassed, don't want to say.

01:47:46.460 --> 01:47:48.070
- Get out of here.
- Did you?

01:47:48.170 --> 01:47:50.989
- Once. I took her once.
- Did you spend money on her?

01:47:51.089 --> 01:47:53.408
I'm not marrying the girl.
I went out for a drive.

01:47:53.508 --> 01:47:56.411
- Why did you deny it when I asked you?
- I didn't deny that.

01:47:56.511 --> 01:47:57.746
Wouldn't you deny it?

01:47:57.846 --> 01:48:00.749
I just want to ask you a question.
Did you touch her, at all?

01:48:00.849 --> 01:48:02.000
Of course not.

01:48:02.100 --> 01:48:04.920
- Did you touch anything she touched?
- Did she touch you?

01:48:05.020 --> 01:48:07.204
You guys are sick, you know that.

01:48:07.314 --> 01:48:09.341
I heard you kissed her goodnight.

01:48:09.441 --> 01:48:12.084
I'm dropping her off.
You got to be polite.

01:48:12.569 --> 01:48:14.503
Remind me never to kiss you.

01:48:14.654 --> 01:48:18.100
- I'll make a note about that one, Shrev.
- Disgusting, Shrevie.

01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:20.102
- You want to hear one?
- Yeah, go.

01:48:20.202 --> 01:48:22.771
This guy's going home from work.
He has a brand new car.

01:48:22.871 --> 01:48:24.606
- What kind?
- Doesn't matter.

01:48:24.706 --> 01:48:27.275
- Brand new car, it doesn't matter.
- Let's hear it.

01:48:27.375 --> 01:48:29.226
So he pulls into this bar.

01:48:29.503 --> 01:48:33.031
He says "Give me...
Give me a scotch and soda."

01:48:34.466 --> 01:48:36.785
- He's drunk, right.
- That's not funny.

01:48:39.387 --> 01:48:42.624
Would you let me tell the joke?
So he says:

01:48:42.724 --> 01:48:46.368
"Yeah, give me a scotch and soda."
And so the bartender says:

01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:48.839
"Do you really think
you should be having one?"

01:48:48.939 --> 01:48:50.382
- Why?
- Why?

01:48:50.482 --> 01:48:53.427
- Why what?
- Why should he not be having one?

01:48:53.527 --> 01:48:57.556
I'm just telling you the joke.
I don't know why he asks him, all right?

01:48:57.656 --> 01:48:59.766
So he looks at the guy and says:

01:48:59.866 --> 01:49:02.811
"Sir, maybe it's none of
my business, but..."

01:49:02.911 --> 01:49:04.771
- Oh, what?
- He forgot something.

01:49:04.871 --> 01:49:06.982
This guy has no arms and no legs.

01:49:07.082 --> 01:49:08.608
How could he drive the car?

01:49:08.708 --> 01:49:10.777
It's a funny joke,
but it doesn't work now.

01:49:10.877 --> 01:49:11.987
Finish it.

01:49:12.087 --> 01:49:14.823
No, I'm starting a joke.
I spend 10 minutes building a joke.

01:49:14.923 --> 01:49:17.659
- Let him finish.
- Now it's not going to be funny.

01:49:17.759 --> 01:49:19.578
- Come on.
- It's not funny now.

01:49:19.678 --> 01:49:21.496
- Tell the joke.
- Just say it.

01:49:21.596 --> 01:49:25.500
Do you remember that time
they brought a girl in here?

01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:26.751
When was that?

01:49:26.851 --> 01:49:30.046
- The only girl that ever set foot...
- They brought a girl here.

01:49:30.146 --> 01:49:31.590
There's never been a woman.

01:49:31.690 --> 01:49:34.509
- When we were in 10th grade...
- Everybody was younger.

01:49:34.609 --> 01:49:36.845
- This place was great then.
- It was great.

01:49:36.945 --> 01:49:39.598
Nice cars then?

01:49:39.698 --> 01:49:42.851
It used to be so cool to be older
and hang out here, and now...

01:49:42.951 --> 01:49:46.720
But now we're older, and we're cooler,
and we're still hanging out here.
