00:55.221 --> 00:57.221
         Off your butt          
    and on your feet, here.     

00:57.223 --> 00:58.489
                 We've got      
                 company coming.

00:58.491 --> 00:59.924
            I want this whole   
            area, please.       

00:59.926 --> 01:01.126
            Come on.            
            Move it, move it.   

01:01.128 --> 01:03.394
Boy, one sergeant's wife        
comes to visit,                 

01:03.396 --> 01:04.929
this places turns               
into an Army barracks.          

01:04.931 --> 01:07.298
            Not Army, Meathead--
            Air Force.          

01:07.300 --> 01:08.432
                  Remember that.

01:08.434 --> 01:10.835
The 15th Air Force              
flying out of Foggia, Italy--   

01:10.837 --> 01:13.237
the ones that won the war.      
      The ones that won the war.

01:13.239 --> 01:14.605
        Yes.                    

01:14.607 --> 01:18.143
Now, let's see what this detail 
    is doing in here.           

01:18.145 --> 01:19.144
                What are you    
                doing, Edith?   

01:19.146 --> 01:21.579
                  Ain't the meat
                  dead yet?     

01:21.581 --> 01:23.682
Oh, no, Archie.                 
It's chuck.                     

01:23.684 --> 01:25.183
I'm tenderizing it.             

01:25.185 --> 01:26.184
                         Oh.    

01:26.186 --> 01:27.385
                Well, that's    
                all right, then.

01:27.387 --> 01:28.386
            You keep stabbing   
            it, Edith,          

01:28.388 --> 01:29.587
    because Duke Loomis' wife   

01:29.589 --> 01:31.289
              ain't no spring   
              chicken, you know.

01:31.291 --> 01:33.925
             She's probably got 
             store teeth by now.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.860
Daddy, I've never seen you      
         this anxious.          

01:35.862 --> 01:38.462
 Why are you making such a fuss 
    over Mrs. Loomis?           

01:38.464 --> 01:40.031
              Oh, I don't care  
              nothing about her.

01:40.033 --> 01:41.833
        I'm doing this for      
        the Duke, my best buddy,

01:41.835 --> 01:43.034
                  the guy that  
                  saved my life.

01:43.036 --> 01:44.769
That's right, Gloria.           

01:44.771 --> 01:46.971
Sergeant Loomis                 
threw himself                   

01:46.973 --> 01:49.674
on a live I-talian              
for Archie.                     

01:54.947 --> 01:58.016
                        Edith...

01:58.018 --> 02:01.319
                it's an I-talian
                grenade, Edith. 

02:01.321 --> 02:03.454
            A grenade... that   
            some joker threw    

02:03.456 --> 02:05.757
              into the barracks,
              there, see?       

02:05.759 --> 02:07.592
        And you can keep this   
        in mind, little girl,   

02:07.594 --> 02:08.793
if it wasn't for the Duke,      

02:08.794 --> 02:10.794
     you probably wouldn't      
         be here today.         

02:10.797 --> 02:12.463
                Neither would I.

02:16.102 --> 02:17.335
            Why not?            

02:17.337 --> 02:20.772
I'd be living someplace else... 

02:20.774 --> 02:22.941
          Aw, come on.          

02:22.943 --> 02:25.176
And Gloria would look different.

02:27.880 --> 02:29.347
            Come on, come on,   
            come on.            

02:29.349 --> 02:30.681
        Listen, what are yous   
        fooling around?         

02:30.683 --> 02:33.051
             You got to set     
             the table in there,

02:33.053 --> 02:35.053
 because I want the front room  
    to be looking nice          

02:35.055 --> 02:36.054
      when she gets here,       

02:36.056 --> 02:37.388
so come on. Set the table.      

02:37.390 --> 02:38.823
Move it, move it, move it, huh? 

02:38.825 --> 02:39.991
What about you,                 
Meathead?                       

02:39.993 --> 02:41.392
Didn't I give you               
a direct order?                 

02:41.394 --> 02:42.627
     Arch, what's the rush?     

02:42.629 --> 02:44.629
    She's not gonna be here     
     for at least an hour.      

02:44.631 --> 02:46.965
I want all departments          
in motion around here!          

02:46.967 --> 02:47.966
Come on.                        

02:47.968 --> 02:49.567
I want the Duke's wife          
to give him                     

02:49.569 --> 02:51.770
a good report on me.            

02:51.772 --> 02:53.138
                Daddy, what I   
                don't understand

02:53.140 --> 02:55.339
             is how can the Duke
             still be alive     

02:55.341 --> 02:57.742
             if he threw himself
             on a grenade?      

02:57.744 --> 03:00.511
         Because it was         
     an I-talian grenade...     

03:03.048 --> 03:04.382
        and it was a dud        

03:04.384 --> 03:09.020
      like everything else      
     them pastafazoos made,     

03:09.022 --> 03:10.688
but that ain't the point.       

03:10.690 --> 03:12.690
    The point is that she's     
coming here for one night.      

03:12.692 --> 03:14.058
  We got to make her welcome.   

03:14.060 --> 03:16.060
  She's going to join the Duke  
     over there in Germany.     

03:16.062 --> 03:18.263
  Come on, we all got to make   
some sacrifices over here.      

03:18.265 --> 03:20.131
     Listen, I'm giving up      
    part of my bed upstairs,    

03:20.133 --> 03:21.365
         right, Edith?          

03:21.367 --> 03:22.600
         That's right.          

03:22.602 --> 03:25.436
         Your father's          
  going to sleep on the sofa.   

03:25.438 --> 03:26.704
      Just think, Archie,       

03:26.706 --> 03:30.108
  this will be the first time   
          in 24 years           

03:30.110 --> 03:32.143
    we ain't slept together.    

03:32.145 --> 03:35.413
Well, that's the sacrifice      
     you gotta make, Edith.     

03:38.750 --> 03:42.120
Look, Archie, I found           
your old photo album            

03:42.122 --> 03:43.421
from the war.                   

03:43.423 --> 03:45.756
I thought maybe you'd like      
to show Mrs. Loomis             

03:45.758 --> 03:47.959
some of your                    
old Army pictures.              

03:47.961 --> 03:49.060
    Oh, that's great.           

03:49.062 --> 03:50.295
  That's good thinking there,   
             Edith.             

03:50.297 --> 03:52.730
     Now maybe I won't have     
    to talk to her too much     

03:52.732 --> 03:54.065
      because she's about       
         as interesting         

03:54.067 --> 03:55.599
    as a doorknob, you know.    

03:55.601 --> 03:58.536
Is there a picture              
of Mrs. Loomis in there?        

03:58.538 --> 03:59.704
                  Nah, nah, nah.

03:59.706 --> 04:00.705
                She was the type

04:00.707 --> 04:02.106
                that always used
                to run and hide 

04:02.108 --> 04:03.507
        when anybody come out   
        with a camera.          

04:03.509 --> 04:04.575
        Why?                    

04:04.577 --> 04:06.945
        Oh, well, Edith,        
    you'd do the same thing     

04:06.947 --> 04:10.448
     if you was 195 pounds      
      at four-foot-seven.       

04:10.450 --> 04:11.449
            [DOORBELL BUZZES]   

04:11.451 --> 04:12.450
    Oh, now, listen, Edith,     

04:12.452 --> 04:13.651
                 whoever that is
                 at the door,   

04:13.653 --> 04:15.586
              please don't waste
              no time, huh?     

04:15.588 --> 04:16.988
      Just hello, goodbye.      
    Nothing else in between.    

04:16.990 --> 04:19.290
            Yeah. Right, Archie.

04:19.291 --> 04:20.291
Hi!                             

04:20.293 --> 04:23.361
Hi. Can I help you,             
Miss?                           

04:23.363 --> 04:26.130
    Missus. Bobbi Jo Loomis,    
          Duke's wife.          

04:26.132 --> 04:29.033
              Oh, well, come in.

04:29.035 --> 04:30.601
Archie, it's Mrs. Loomis.       

04:30.603 --> 04:33.637
    She's lost weight           
    and grown taller.           

04:39.278 --> 04:40.345
Wait a minute, Edith.           

04:40.347 --> 04:41.846
There's something               
ain't kosher here.              

04:41.848 --> 04:42.847
Look out, look out.             

04:42.849 --> 04:44.048
Uh, did you say...?             

04:44.050 --> 04:47.385
              I know you, PFC   
              Archie Bunker.    

04:47.387 --> 04:49.553
              I got a message   
              for you from Duke.

04:53.125 --> 04:56.494
      What's the message?       

05:00.199 --> 05:02.666
Now, wait a minute,             
I don't think I get this...     

05:02.668 --> 05:05.169
            Oh, I'm Bobbi Jo,   
            Duke's wife.        

05:05.171 --> 05:08.839
Well, come in, Mrs. Loomis,     
and sit down.                   

05:08.841 --> 05:10.241
            Yeah, wait a minute.
            Now, you know,      

05:10.243 --> 05:11.842
              I knew Duke's wife
              awful well...     

05:11.844 --> 05:12.843
No, no, no.                     

05:12.845 --> 05:14.812
  I know what's confusing you.  

05:14.814 --> 05:16.981
    You were expecting          
     the first Mrs. Loomis.     

05:16.983 --> 05:18.482
        I'm the second.         

05:18.484 --> 05:20.084
     The first is deceased.     

05:20.086 --> 05:21.652
                         Oh.    

05:21.654 --> 05:25.056
Wait happened to her?           

05:25.058 --> 05:26.724
        She died.               

05:26.726 --> 05:31.229
     Oh.                        
                     Oh.        

05:31.231 --> 05:33.031
        Oh, I guess Duke        
    should have warned you.     

05:33.033 --> 05:34.899
    I hope you're not           
    too disappointed.           

05:34.901 --> 05:36.968
            Oh, no.             
  We're very happy to see you.  

05:36.970 --> 05:38.602
Uh, I'm their daughter, Gloria, 

05:38.604 --> 05:40.038
    and this is my husband,

05:40.040 --> 05:41.505
    Hi.                         
                        Hi.     

05:41.507 --> 05:43.441
    So, uh, you're the Duke's   
    second wife, huh?           

05:43.443 --> 05:44.575
            What do you know?   

05:44.577 --> 05:46.978
        You know, I was going to
        ask you for your ID Card

05:46.980 --> 05:48.046
          over here at the door.

05:48.048 --> 05:50.448
            [LAUGHS]            
      I wouldn't need ID.       

05:50.450 --> 05:52.650
    All I'd have to do          
 is remind you of those stories 

05:52.652 --> 05:54.252
      about you and Duke,       

05:54.254 --> 05:56.887
like the time you two were      
    at Madam Talini's place.    

05:56.889 --> 06:00.491
                Madam Ta-who?   

06:00.493 --> 06:02.827
    In Rome, in 1945,           

06:02.829 --> 06:05.229
    in that big house           
    near the train station.     

06:05.231 --> 06:06.664
                  Uh, hey! Uh...

06:06.666 --> 06:10.034
            Where'd you leave   
            your bags?          

06:10.036 --> 06:11.436
The driver left it              
on the porch.                   

06:11.438 --> 06:12.470
                Oh, Meathead,   

06:12.472 --> 06:13.938
            don't be standing   
            there doing nothing.

06:13.940 --> 06:15.606
                Get the suitcase
                on the porch.   

06:15.608 --> 06:16.874
            Bring it in here.   

06:16.876 --> 06:18.742
      Who's Madam Talini?       

06:19.878 --> 06:23.414
                 A nurse, Edith.

06:23.416 --> 06:25.316
              An Air Corps nurse
              over there.       

06:25.318 --> 06:26.784
                In fact, she was
                the head nurse, 

06:26.786 --> 06:29.020
             which is why they  
             called her "madam."

06:29.022 --> 06:31.589
Oh.                             

06:31.591 --> 06:33.157
Excuse me.                      

06:33.159 --> 06:35.893
    Gloria and me better get    
    the dinner ready,           

06:35.895 --> 06:37.095
         and meantime,          

06:37.097 --> 06:39.763
         you could help         
 entertain Mrs. Loomis, Archie. 

06:39.765 --> 06:41.899
              Yeah, yeah. Sure. 
              I can handle that.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.267
                 Ha, ha, ha.    

06:43.269 --> 06:46.004
Hey, let me take your coat      
      there, Mrs. Loomis.       

06:46.006 --> 06:47.571
There. It'll make you           
feel comfortable.               

06:47.573 --> 06:49.207

What are you looking at?        

07:09.262 --> 07:11.195
            Nothing.            

07:12.398 --> 07:14.598
Take the suitcase

07:14.600 --> 07:16.267
          Sure, Arch.           

07:19.138 --> 07:20.538
Well, why don't we make         
ourselves comfortable,          

07:20.540 --> 07:21.805
Mrs. Loomis?                    

07:21.807 --> 07:23.807
Why don't you park yourself     
on the sofa over there?         

07:23.809 --> 07:24.808
                 Well, thank you
                 so much.       

07:24.810 --> 07:27.678
And, uh, I'll                   
just hang up your coat          

07:27.680 --> 07:29.080
over here on a hook.            

07:29.082 --> 07:30.214
          [CHUCKLING]           

07:30.216 --> 07:31.215
 Jeez, we wasn't expecting you  

07:31.217 --> 07:32.616
    for about an hour, here,    
        you know.               

07:32.618 --> 07:34.919
                Oh, well, I took
                an earlier bus. 

07:34.921 --> 07:37.155
Oh, you took                    
an earlier bus.                 

07:37.157 --> 07:39.123
Yeah, oh,                       
and listen, listen.             

07:39.125 --> 07:44.062
Edith dug out this old          
photo album of pictures         

07:44.064 --> 07:45.863
of the Duke and me,             
Mrs. Loomis.                    

07:45.865 --> 07:48.199
            Oh, why don't you   
            call me Bobbi Jo?   

07:48.201 --> 07:49.467
        Bobbi Jo?               

07:49.469 --> 07:51.602
        Yeah, all right,        
      I'll call you that.       

07:51.604 --> 07:53.871
      That's a boy's name,      
          though, huh?          

07:53.873 --> 07:57.741
      You don't look like       
        no boy, though.         

07:57.743 --> 07:59.843
    Aren't you sweet.           

07:59.845 --> 08:01.745

    I am just dying to hear     

08:01.747 --> 08:04.615
    everything you got          
     to tell me about Duke.     

08:04.617 --> 08:07.518
      You know, we barely       
     said "I do" when wham!     

08:07.520 --> 08:10.455
The Air Force shipped him       
      off to West Germany       

08:10.457 --> 08:11.322
        just like that.         

08:13.792 --> 08:16.827
The Air Force ain't got         
no human feeling at all, huh?   

08:16.829 --> 08:18.896
         Well, now, why don't we
         look at the pictures?  

08:18.898 --> 08:19.763
        Yeah.                   

08:20.899 --> 08:22.833
            Oh, look at Duke,   

08:22.835 --> 08:25.203
                and look at that
                head of hair.   

08:25.205 --> 08:26.604
        Oh, Archie, where was   
        this picture taken?     

08:26.606 --> 08:29.307
Oh, that's taken                
over there in Rome.             

08:29.309 --> 08:31.309
That's me and Duke eating       
at one of them restaurants      

08:31.311 --> 08:33.811
that must have run out          
of roof, you know,              

08:33.813 --> 08:35.779
because we're eating outside.   

08:35.780 --> 08:38.582
            Oh, oh, now, Archie.

08:38.585 --> 08:41.751
          Well, now, here's you,
          but I can't find Duke.

08:41.754 --> 08:42.919
        Now, which one is he?

08:55.968 --> 09:00.471

         find him looking there.

            Oh, no.             

09:03.543 --> 09:05.476

there he is!                    

09:06.479 --> 09:07.745
He was there                    
all the time.                   

09:07.747 --> 09:10.515

09:10.517 --> 09:13.984
Oh, you can't                   
blame me, huh?                  

09:23.061 --> 09:24.795
        How long are you        
        standing there?         

09:24.797 --> 09:26.430
        I just got here.        

09:26.432 --> 09:30.201
     Don't you never knock      
when you come into a room?      

09:30.203 --> 09:34.405
    What you want me to do,     
     knock on the banister?

09:41.381 --> 09:43.181
 Oh, dinner's ready, huh? Yeah.

Uh, Bobbi Jo,                   
dinner's ready.                 

09:45.585 --> 09:47.385
We all go to the table          
when dinner's ready.

             me help you serve. 

09:52.858 --> 09:54.358

    I'm a terrific waitress.    

09:54.360 --> 09:55.660
Oh, thank you.

                None of that.

              everything, huh?  

10:05.438 --> 10:09.273
     Right next to the old      
     patroney of the house, huh?

10:09.275 --> 10:10.140
That's sweet.                   

10:11.410 --> 10:12.276
                     What? What?

10:13.512 --> 10:15.580
             What?              

10:15.582 --> 10:18.048
             Converse nice about
             something here.    

10:18.050 --> 10:19.049
Uh...                           

10:19.051 --> 10:20.918
         Oh, Bobbi Jo,          

10:20.920 --> 10:22.587
     did you say something      
    about being a waitress?     

10:22.589 --> 10:23.588
                      Well, yes.

10:23.590 --> 10:25.623
That's how I met Duke.          

10:25.625 --> 10:27.391
I was working                   
at the Burgerama.               

10:27.393 --> 10:30.160
That's a drive-in on Route 27   
outside of Tallahassee.         

10:30.162 --> 10:32.296
You know it?                    

10:32.298 --> 10:34.098
            Uh, no.             

10:34.100 --> 10:35.099
                             Oh.

10:35.101 --> 10:37.868
Well, the minute Duke drove up, 

10:37.870 --> 10:39.903
and I saw that cute little      
      bald-headed sergeant      

10:39.905 --> 10:45.409
in that cute little sports car, 
          a yellow MG,          

10:45.411 --> 10:49.347
I said to myself, "Bobbi Jo, you
     got to have that man."     

10:49.349 --> 10:53.217
  Well, what did the Duke say   
 when he first set eyes on you? 

10:53.219 --> 10:55.486
Well, I was standing there      
 in my little cowgirl outfit--  

10:55.488 --> 10:58.122
  you know, that's what all us  
 girls wore at the Burgerama--  

10:58.124 --> 11:00.558
    and Duke drove up           
    and he honked his horn,     

11:00.560 --> 11:02.893
      and I went strutting      
      on over with my menu      

11:02.895 --> 11:04.094
    you know, the way we do,    

11:04.096 --> 11:05.829
          and I had on          
     my little cowgirl hat      

11:05.831 --> 11:09.300
      and my white blouse       
and my little vest with tassels 

11:09.302 --> 11:11.969
                  and itty-bity 
                  red hot pants,

11:11.971 --> 11:13.771
                high white boots
                up to here,     

11:13.773 --> 11:15.473
                 and he took one
                 look and said, 

11:15.475 --> 11:18.075
            "I'll have a bowl   
            of thighs."         

11:18.077 --> 11:20.210
             Whoa!

                      [LAUGHING]

11:22.581 --> 11:26.617
 Well, he meant chicken thighs, 
        of course.              

11:26.619 --> 11:28.519
          Here we are.          

11:28.521 --> 11:31.355
        I hope everybody        
         likes it rare.         

11:31.357 --> 11:32.990
          Hey, Edith, you should
          have heard about      

11:32.992 --> 11:34.392
         the whirlwind courtship

11:34.394 --> 11:36.193
             between Bobbi Jo   
             and the Duke, here.

11:36.195 --> 11:39.730
        Oh, I just love         
    true love stories.          

11:39.732 --> 11:41.699
How did he propose to you?      

11:41.701 --> 11:44.067
Well, it was early one morning, 

11:44.069 --> 11:47.705
and he just woke me up and said,
  "Honey, let's get married."   

11:56.948 --> 11:59.417
             Well, uh, you know,

11:59.419 --> 12:01.819
        that's a kind of a      
        risqué story for us here

12:01.821 --> 12:03.921
        because, you know, we're
        kind of old-fashioned.  

12:03.923 --> 12:05.790
Oh, what did I say?             

12:05.792 --> 12:08.258
I was asleep,                   
and the phone rang              

12:08.260 --> 12:10.093
and it was Duke.                

12:10.095 --> 12:12.963
          Oh, oh, oh!           

12:12.965 --> 12:16.467
Gee, well, what the hell.       
         That's legit.          

12:19.571 --> 12:21.372
    See there, Edith?           
    Nothing wrong with that.    

12:21.374 --> 12:22.707
              Huh?              

12:24.576 --> 12:27.778
            Go on out and get   
            the rolls, huh?     

12:27.780 --> 12:29.046
    Vegetables.                 
    Hot stuff.                  

12:29.048 --> 12:30.848
    Oh, now, Gloria, let me     
      help you with that.       

12:30.850 --> 12:32.316
                     No, no, no!

12:32.318 --> 12:34.151
        You can't serve         
      nothing around here.      

12:34.153 --> 12:37.321
     You're the guest here.     
 Give me that. I'll serve that. 

12:37.323 --> 12:39.824
    What are you looking at?    
      Get the salad, huh?       

12:39.826 --> 12:42.092
Here we, oh...                  
look at this here, carrots.     

12:42.094 --> 12:43.494
They say they're                
awful good for you.             

12:43.496 --> 12:45.062
 Yeah, good for the eyes, Arch. 

12:49.868 --> 12:51.702
         [MOUTHS WORDS]         

12:53.071 --> 12:56.273
                 Hurry up with  
                 the salad, huh?

12:56.275 --> 12:57.274
                 Come on, Edith.

12:57.276 --> 12:59.076
                I'm waiting to  
                serve the rolls.

12:59.078 --> 13:02.913
Archie, you ain't never         
helped serve dinner before.     

13:02.915 --> 13:04.915
  Well, Bobbi Jo Loomis ain't   
 never been here before, Edith. 

13:04.917 --> 13:06.717
     Hey, hey, what do you      
    think of her, huh?          

13:06.719 --> 13:08.719
     Cute the way she talks     
with the southern accent there. 

13:08.721 --> 13:13.657
        Yeah, and she's         
    so cheerful and lively.     

13:13.659 --> 13:15.993
         Duke was lucky         
    to have found her.          

13:15.995 --> 13:19.397
Oh, Edith, I hope he was lucky. 

13:19.399 --> 13:20.765
What do you mean?               

13:20.767 --> 13:23.000
    Oh, Edith, you can tell     
by looking at her there--       

13:23.002 --> 13:24.802
        fast and loose.         

13:26.471 --> 13:28.305
          Oh, Archie.           

13:28.307 --> 13:30.073
     But I don't blame her      
          for nothing.          

13:30.075 --> 13:31.542
 I mean, that's the way it is.  

13:31.544 --> 13:33.878
    Nature, you know--          
    good-looking dame           

13:33.880 --> 13:35.979
    with a shape there          
        and everything.         

13:35.981 --> 13:37.281
         Men are always         
    turning after her,          

13:37.283 --> 13:38.916
give her the double-O, you know.

13:38.918 --> 13:41.585
  Now, listen, dames like that  
  put thoughts in guys' heads.  

13:41.587 --> 13:43.587
     Why kind of thoughts?      

13:46.658 --> 13:49.326
Well, I don't know, Edith.      

13:49.328 --> 13:52.229
    I don't have no thoughts    
        like that.              

14:01.039 --> 14:02.439
  Here are the last two cups,   
            Gloria.             

14:02.441 --> 14:03.440
Oh, thank you.                  

14:03.442 --> 14:04.642
Michael, if you                 
don't speed up,                 

14:04.644 --> 14:05.909
we'll never                     
get to the movies.              

14:05.911 --> 14:07.911
  Bobbi Jo, what are you doing  
      out in the kitchen?       

14:07.913 --> 14:09.113
                We got a lot    
                more pictures   

14:09.115 --> 14:10.114
                to look at here.

14:10.116 --> 14:11.949
We got a lot                    
of ground to cover.             

14:13.518 --> 14:15.152
Daddy sure is                   
acting different.               

14:15.154 --> 14:16.020
I wonder what it is.            

14:17.689 --> 14:20.323
     I think it's his eyes.     

14:21.693 --> 14:22.760
        His eyes?               

14:22.762 --> 14:24.561
             Oh, Gloria, haven't
             you noticed        

14:24.563 --> 14:26.697
            the way he's been   
            looking at Bobbi Jo?

14:26.699 --> 14:28.298
Michael,                        
that's my father.               

14:28.300 --> 14:30.333
Those things aren't             
on his mind.                    

14:30.335 --> 14:33.170
  Well, Gloria, something is.   

14:33.172 --> 14:35.472
You got to admit Bobbi Jo is... 

14:35.474 --> 14:36.874
    uh, pretty well endowed.    

14:36.876 --> 14:40.510
     Sounds like your eyes      
have been working overtime too. 

14:40.512 --> 14:44.481
         Not overtime,          
  just a regular working day.   

14:47.618 --> 14:51.388
    Eight hours of looking,     
     and then I punch out.      

14:51.390 --> 14:55.125
     You're as big a letch      
    as you say my father is.    

14:55.127 --> 14:59.997
 Gloria, a little innocent lust 
      never hurt anybody.       

14:59.999 --> 15:02.399
You just have to know how       
  to deal with it, that's all.  

15:02.401 --> 15:04.601
  See, your father, he doesn't  
know how to deal with it.       

15:04.603 --> 15:07.004
How do you deal with your lust? 

15:07.006 --> 15:08.605
            Well...             

15:08.607 --> 15:10.607
    Go ahead, Michael,          
        you can tell me.        

15:10.609 --> 15:13.143
        How do you deal         
        with your lust?         

15:18.649 --> 15:21.752
         That's funny.          
  That's how I deal with mine.  

15:23.788 --> 15:25.355
And that's                      
the Duke and me.                

15:25.357 --> 15:26.957
We're fooling around            
with a couple of girls          

15:26.959 --> 15:28.692
in the street                   
in Naples, there.               

15:28.694 --> 15:32.730
I tell you, looking at them     
old pictures there, you know,   

15:32.732 --> 15:35.699
it makes me feel                
that, well...                   

15:35.701 --> 15:37.634
like I was                      
30 years younger.               

15:37.636 --> 15:40.537
            Archie?             
What?                           

15:40.539 --> 15:42.272
I'm gonna make up the sofa now. 

15:42.274 --> 15:43.741
    It's getting late,          

15:43.743 --> 15:45.342
            and you got to go   
            to work tomorrow.   

15:45.344 --> 15:47.077
Oh, Edith, Edith, huh?          
It's only 10:00.                

15:47.079 --> 15:49.079
Who the hell ever               
goes to bed at 10:00?           

15:49.081 --> 15:51.949
                 You do, Archie.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.717
I'm putting you out             
of your bedroom.                

15:53.719 --> 15:55.052
Now, I'll sleep                 
on the couch.                   

15:55.054 --> 15:57.054
            Oh, no. He'll be    
            very comfortable.   

15:57.056 --> 15:59.356
             I even brought down
             his special pillow.

15:59.358 --> 16:01.058
Oh, ixnay on the...             

16:01.060 --> 16:03.894
              Archie can't sleep
              without it.       

16:03.896 --> 16:06.396
 Oh, you got one of those too.  

16:06.398 --> 16:08.932
            Oh, he's got lots   
            of those things.    

16:08.934 --> 16:10.667
            He can't even eat   
            his cereal          

16:10.669 --> 16:13.737
             without his Chicago
             World's Fair spoon.

16:24.249 --> 16:26.316
Never mind the pillow,          
huh, Edith?                     

16:26.318 --> 16:27.751
     Come here, come here.      

16:27.753 --> 16:29.719
Go upstairs and get me          
a regular pillow, huh?          

16:29.721 --> 16:30.720
        All right.              

16:30.722 --> 16:32.122
That's all I need               
to sleep on                     

16:32.124 --> 16:34.158
is a regular pillow, Edith.     

16:34.160 --> 16:36.059
                    Oh.         
    Oh, jeez.                   

16:36.061 --> 16:37.294
Excuse me, there,               
Bobbi Jo.                       

16:37.296 --> 16:39.529
Hey, come on, it's              
the shank of the evening.       

16:39.531 --> 16:40.931
Sit down and                    
we'll look at the...            

16:40.933 --> 16:42.266
                 Oh, no, no, no.

16:42.268 --> 16:43.867
              See, I really have
              to get to sleep.  

16:43.869 --> 16:46.270
        My flight for Germany   
        is at 8:00 a.m.         

16:46.272 --> 16:48.538
          But you know, you have
          been just so sweet.   

16:48.540 --> 16:50.207
        I mean, really, so kind,

16:50.209 --> 16:51.741
              and I'm surely    
              going to tell Duke

16:51.743 --> 16:53.576
              just how wonderful
              you've been to me.

16:53.578 --> 16:55.779
  Oh, hey, likewise, I'm sure.  

16:55.781 --> 16:58.581
    Well, but for now,          
     I'm just going to say      

16:58.583 --> 17:02.585
    good night, sleep tight,    
and don't let the bed bugs bite.

17:04.289 --> 17:06.290
             Good night, Mike.  
             Good night, Gloria.

17:06.291 --> 17:08.291
BOTH:                           
Good night.                     

17:18.936 --> 17:20.337
 What are yous two doing here?  

17:20.339 --> 17:22.771
                We live here.   

17:26.410 --> 17:28.212
    You doing a little spying   
    here too, ain't you?        

17:28.214 --> 17:29.379
          What are you          
         talking about?         

17:29.381 --> 17:31.381
          Get in the kitchen.   
          I want to talk to you.

17:31.383 --> 17:32.382
What's the matter               
with you?                       

17:32.384 --> 17:33.616
Are you going nuts              
or something?                   

17:33.618 --> 17:35.618
          Get in the kitchen.   
          I want to talk to you.

17:35.620 --> 17:38.588
    What yous two seen out      
    there, you didn't see it!   

17:38.590 --> 17:39.957
What's going on,                
Daddy?                          

17:39.959 --> 17:42.893
I don't want neither one of yous
     to get the wrong idea,     

17:42.895 --> 17:44.361
see, especially you, the husband

17:44.363 --> 17:45.963
      because monkey sees,      
          monkey does!          

17:48.599 --> 17:50.400
 And I don't go around kissing  
         no women, see,         

17:50.402 --> 17:52.602
  and I didn't kiss that woman  
out there. She kissed me.       

17:52.604 --> 17:53.703
      Now, remember that,       
        then forget it.         

17:56.841 --> 17:58.242
            Archie, what are you
            so uptight about?   

17:58.244 --> 17:59.276
             Just because you're
             feeling guilty     

17:59.278 --> 18:00.610
        about being attracted   
        to Bobbi Jo?            

18:00.612 --> 18:01.611
What do you mean,               
"guilty"?                       

18:01.613 --> 18:02.612
I ain't guilty                  
about nothing!                  

18:02.614 --> 18:05.148
Why should I                    
be guilty?                      

18:05.150 --> 18:07.450
If anyone's guilty, well,       
she's guilty out there.         

18:07.452 --> 18:09.519
I didn't kiss Bobbi Jo.         
Bobbi Jo kissed me.             

18:09.521 --> 18:10.921
She's the one                   
that made the pass.             

18:10.923 --> 18:12.155
             Daddy.             

18:12.157 --> 18:13.357
                    She made a  
                    pass at you?

18:13.359 --> 18:15.392
        No, she didn't.         
     Well, all right, yeah.     

18:15.394 --> 18:16.894
        She made a pass.        

18:19.697 --> 18:21.798
GLORIA: Mrs. Loomis             
made a pass at you?             

18:21.800 --> 18:23.533
ARCHIE:                         
Made a pass, yes! Shh!          

18:27.005 --> 18:29.373
Look at the face on you.        
What's on your mind?            

18:29.375 --> 18:30.473
                  Nothing.      

18:30.475 --> 18:31.875
            It's just hard      
            for me to believe   

18:31.877 --> 18:33.576
             that anybody would 
             make a pass at you.

18:37.615 --> 18:39.649
Don't be a wise guy, huh?       

18:39.651 --> 18:41.385
      Just remember this,       
    the two of yous--           

18:41.387 --> 18:42.986
    Edith ain't supposed to     
    know nothing about that.    

18:42.988 --> 18:44.587
MICHAEL: All right,             
don't worry about it, Arch.     

18:44.589 --> 18:46.656
Come on, Gloria, we'll          
be late for the movies.         

18:46.658 --> 18:48.625
You're going to                 
the movies late, huh?           

18:48.627 --> 18:50.860
    When you come home late,    
    don't wake me up!           

18:50.862 --> 18:53.230
  I'll be on the couch, there.  

18:59.837 --> 19:02.306
Oh, Edith,                      
you startled me.                

19:02.308 --> 19:03.307
                      I'm sorry.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.842
Edith, do you like this?        

19:05.844 --> 19:06.977
            It's very pretty.   

19:06.979 --> 19:08.345
Oh, I'm glad                    
you think so.                   

19:08.347 --> 19:10.147
I was going to wear it          
to bed tonight,                 

19:10.149 --> 19:12.282
but I think I'll wait           
till Duke can see it.           

19:13.784 --> 19:16.420
         I got something to tell
         you about going to bed.

19:16.422 --> 19:17.421
What's that, Edith?             

19:17.423 --> 19:19.556
          You're not.           

19:21.826 --> 19:23.460
             What?              

19:23.462 --> 19:28.565
 I don't think it's a good idea 
 for you to sleep here tonight. 

19:28.567 --> 19:30.367
Well, now, you see,             
I have been a problem.          

19:30.369 --> 19:32.169
I'm not going to be             
another bit of trouble.         

19:32.171 --> 19:33.570
I'm just going                  
to get my things                

19:33.572 --> 19:34.804
                  and go sleep  
                  on that couch.

19:34.806 --> 19:37.107
No!

  Archie? I don't understand.   

19:48.353 --> 19:51.955
  It's something I just heard.  

19:51.957 --> 19:54.891
      I can't explain it,       

19:54.893 --> 19:57.760
  and I never in my whole life  

19:57.762 --> 20:01.798
have I ever asked anybody       
    to leave my house,          

20:01.800 --> 20:03.333
    and if I stay here          
        another minute,         

20:03.335 --> 20:05.668
         I'm gonna cry.         

20:05.670 --> 20:11.241
    So please... that's all.    
            Please.             

20:28.592 --> 20:29.926
Hey, what's going on,           
Bobbi Jo?                       

20:29.928 --> 20:31.861
Where are you going             
with the suitcase?              

20:31.863 --> 20:33.463
                 Don't you know?

20:33.465 --> 20:34.797
                 Your wife asked
                 me to leave.   

20:36.600 --> 20:39.503
Aw, no, no, Bobbi Jo.           

20:39.505 --> 20:41.271
Edith never said that.          

20:41.273 --> 20:43.073
        She said it was         
      something she heard       

20:43.075 --> 20:44.974
     when she was down here     
      a little while ago.       

20:47.512 --> 20:49.879
     Oh, was she down here      
      a little while ago?       

20:49.881 --> 20:52.549
      You wouldn't happen       
    to know what she heard?     

20:54.652 --> 20:55.885
              No.               

20:55.887 --> 21:00.223
        Your wife thinks        
    I have a thing for you.     

21:00.225 --> 21:01.525
 Now, why does she think that?  

21:03.528 --> 21:05.028
    Did she say that?           

21:05.030 --> 21:07.397
      She didn't have to.       

21:09.900 --> 21:12.135
    Oh, this is kind of bad,    
        Bobbi Jo.               

21:12.137 --> 21:14.871
    No. Don't worry, Archie.    

21:14.873 --> 21:19.776
 Nobody's gonna know about this 
    except you, me and Duke.    

21:19.778 --> 21:21.778
The Duke? No, no, no,           
wait a minute, Bobbi Jo.        

21:21.780 --> 21:23.780
You can't go out like this.     
Now, wait a minute.             

21:23.782 --> 21:25.615
Now, you put the bag down       
and stay here.                  

21:25.617 --> 21:27.684
Edith. Hey, Edith.              
Come down here, will you?       

21:27.686 --> 21:29.719
I want to talk                  
to you, huh?                    

21:29.721 --> 21:32.489
Uh, listen,                     
there was a mix-up              

21:32.491 --> 21:34.524
or something, you know,         

21:34.526 --> 21:35.725
and Edith didn't                
mean that.                      

21:35.727 --> 21:36.793
Now, I'll talk to her.          

21:36.795 --> 21:38.128
I'll straighten it              
all out, see?                   

21:38.130 --> 21:39.129
So, uh, Edith...                

21:39.131 --> 21:42.566
Edith?                          

21:42.568 --> 21:45.102
Uh, Edith, uh, I want           
to talk to you, Edith,          

21:45.104 --> 21:47.170
but out                         
in the kitchen, huh?            

21:47.172 --> 21:50.574
  Now, listen, you stay here.   
  Now, don't go nowhere, see.

                 you doing?     

21:54.779 --> 21:57.447
              You can't kick her
              out of the house. 

21:57.449 --> 22:00.683
  Is it true what I heard you   
        tell the kids--         

22:00.685 --> 22:03.386
      that she kissed you       
    and made a pass at you?     

22:03.388 --> 22:06.456
    Well, Edith, yes and no.    

22:06.458 --> 22:08.125
      What does that mean?      

22:10.128 --> 22:14.397
      Yes, she kissed me,       
but no, it wasn't no pass.      

22:14.399 --> 22:17.234
 But I heard you tell the kids  
            it was.

         Edith, Edith,

    You wouldn't know that,     

22:29.848 --> 22:31.848

  a man of the world like me,
