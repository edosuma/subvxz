WEBVTT

00:10.779 --> 00:12.213
Where's Mommy?

00:12.247 --> 00:14.849
Hi. She didn't sleep with you?

00:14.883 --> 00:16.851
No.

00:16.885 --> 00:19.754
Okay. Nicole?

00:19.788 --> 00:22.022
I already checked. She's not here.

00:22.057 --> 00:25.025
Well, we're just gonna have
to figure this out, won't we?

00:25.060 --> 00:27.928
Go get dressed, hon.
I'll take you to school.

00:31.900 --> 00:33.234
Nicole, it's 7:00 in the morning.

00:33.268 --> 00:35.269
Where are you? I need to get to work.

00:35.303 --> 00:37.972
Can you call me?

00:38.006 --> 00:39.473
It's just not like her.

00:39.508 --> 00:41.942
Nicole would never just not come home.

00:41.977 --> 00:43.944
Maybe she got lucky.

00:43.979 --> 00:45.813
My conservative sister?

00:45.847 --> 00:48.382
She's been married to that
pretentious idiot for ten years.

00:48.417 --> 00:50.050
She deserves a little luck.

00:50.085 --> 00:51.385
Okay. Okay, fine.

00:51.420 --> 00:53.120
Then why isn't she answering her calls?

00:53.155 --> 00:54.822
It keeps going straight to voicemail.

00:54.856 --> 00:57.491
Kim, when people go out
all night, their phones die.

00:57.526 --> 00:59.427
Happens to me all the time.

00:59.461 --> 01:01.262
Happened to me one time.

01:01.296 --> 01:03.130
Just once.

01:06.168 --> 01:07.301
There you go.

01:07.335 --> 01:08.769
Where the hell are you?

01:08.804 --> 01:11.138
<i>Help me. I'm in trouble.</i>

01:11.173 --> 01:14.241
Nicole? What's the matter? Nicole?

01:14.276 --> 01:16.977
<i>- Kim...
- Nicole?</i>

01:17.012 --> 01:19.113
What happened?

01:19.147 --> 01:20.481
She said she was in trouble. I don't...

01:23.351 --> 01:25.753
<i>Hey, it's Nicole.
Please leave a message.</i>

01:25.787 --> 01:27.421
Nicole, where are you? Call me.

01:27.456 --> 01:28.823
What's the matter, Kim?

01:28.857 --> 01:30.524
It... it keeps going to voicemail.

01:30.559 --> 01:32.259
Who?

01:32.294 --> 01:34.495
My sister. She went out
with her girlfriends last night

01:34.529 --> 01:35.996
and never came home.

01:36.031 --> 01:37.531
She just called.
She said she was in trouble.

01:37.566 --> 01:39.366
The call cut out,
and now she's not answering,

01:39.401 --> 01:41.836
and she sounds really scared.

01:41.870 --> 01:44.271
Well, let's ping her phone.
Take somebody. Go look for her.

01:44.306 --> 01:45.506
- I'll go.
- Thanks.

01:45.540 --> 01:47.241
Come on.

01:49.000 --> 01:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:56.518 --> 01:58.452
Okay, the call logs show

01:58.487 --> 02:00.187
she made three calls from Lake Street,

02:00.222 --> 02:01.989
two to 911 that were disconnected,

02:02.023 --> 02:04.992
hitting off two different
towers... there, there.

02:05.026 --> 02:06.794
Like she was in a moving car.

02:06.828 --> 02:08.963
Yeah. Or a train.

02:08.997 --> 02:11.332
Her call to me this morning...
it had the weakest signal.

02:11.366 --> 02:15.035
The weakest signal would be
from inside of the station.

02:23.445 --> 02:25.279
Nicole?

02:26.581 --> 02:28.415
Nicole! Oh, my God.

02:28.450 --> 02:30.985
Hey, no... hey, it's me.
It's me. It's just me.

02:31.019 --> 02:32.820
It's just me. Are you hurt?

02:32.854 --> 02:35.856
What happened? Nicole, what happened?

02:35.891 --> 02:36.991
Nicole?

02:37.025 --> 02:38.993
I was raped.

02:41.630 --> 02:43.230
Okay.

02:43.265 --> 02:45.332
She's losing a lot of blood.
Call an ambulance.

02:45.367 --> 02:47.868
Okay, I'm here. I'm here.
I'm here. It's okay.

02:49.538 --> 02:50.905
I'm here, okay?

02:55.715 --> 02:59.521

03:02.180 --> 03:04.781
The X-ray showed free air
in her abdomen,

03:04.815 --> 03:06.272
which means her bowel was perforated.

03:06.297 --> 03:07.864
It's why she's in so much pain.

03:07.899 --> 03:09.633
- From a rape?
- We haven't gotten the results

03:09.667 --> 03:11.968
from the SART exam,
but everything I've seen is

03:12.003 --> 03:13.470
consistent with a vicious assault.

03:13.504 --> 03:14.838
- Kim!
- Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

03:14.872 --> 03:16.373
- I'm here.
- I'm scared.

03:16.407 --> 03:17.641
I know. Trust me.
You're in really good hands.

03:17.675 --> 03:19.176
They're gonna fix you up, okay?

03:19.210 --> 03:20.377
- Where's Zoe?
- She's at school,

03:20.411 --> 03:21.945
- and she's fine.
- Does she know?

03:21.979 --> 03:23.547
No. No.

03:25.149 --> 03:26.349
Nicole, can you remember
anything that happened?

03:26.384 --> 03:29.052
Even the smallest detail would help.

03:29.087 --> 03:30.520
I can't remember.

03:30.555 --> 03:33.356
I'm sorry. They're waiting in the OR.

03:35.259 --> 03:37.027
I love you.

03:43.568 --> 03:45.902
What do we know about Burgess' sister?

03:45.937 --> 03:48.972
Yeah, uh, Nicole Silver.

03:49.006 --> 03:50.574
She's in surgery right now

03:50.608 --> 03:53.543
with injuries sustained
from what appears to be

03:53.578 --> 03:55.479
a brutal rape.

03:55.513 --> 03:59.049
She has no recollection of
the attack or who attacked her.

03:59.083 --> 04:01.551
We do know that Nicole was out
with girlfriends last night.

04:01.586 --> 04:03.487
They were celebrating
a friend's birthday.

04:03.521 --> 04:06.256
Burgess said that her sister's
going through a nasty divorce.

04:06.290 --> 04:08.358
She's fighting for custody
of her daughter.

04:08.392 --> 04:10.360
- We look at the husband?
- Jordan Silver.

04:10.394 --> 04:12.596
He's flying back
from Pittsburgh right now.

04:12.630 --> 04:14.464
Hey.

04:18.736 --> 04:21.036
How's Nicole?

04:21.072 --> 04:23.573
She's still sedated.

04:23.608 --> 04:25.342
The doctor said she was sodomized.

04:25.376 --> 04:27.410
That's why the blood...

04:29.647 --> 04:33.416
Uh, tox report came back.
Her blood alcohol was .12,

04:33.451 --> 04:35.552
which is not enough
to make her black out,

04:35.586 --> 04:37.220
but she had enough ketamine
in her system

04:37.255 --> 04:39.055
to knock out a horse.

04:39.090 --> 04:41.224
All right, get the names of
the women at the birthday party.

04:41.259 --> 04:43.493
Find the bars they hit. Let's go.

04:45.763 --> 04:49.099
- Sarge?
- Yeah?

04:49.133 --> 04:50.600
Thank you for taking this on.

04:50.635 --> 04:53.737
An attack on your family is
an attack on our family.

04:57.608 --> 04:59.943
So, you're the kick-ass sister.

04:59.977 --> 05:02.445
Nicole was bragging about you
last night.

05:02.480 --> 05:03.747
Yeah?

05:03.781 --> 05:06.449
It's one of the few things I remember.

05:06.484 --> 05:10.120
My head feels like a
World War II documentary today.

05:13.524 --> 05:16.493
What's this about?

05:16.527 --> 05:20.297
Well, Nicole was sexually assaulted

05:20.331 --> 05:23.233
sometime late last night
or early this morning.

05:23.267 --> 05:25.435
Oh, my God. What happened?

05:25.469 --> 05:27.404
She doesn't remember.

05:27.438 --> 05:31.007
Jasmine, can you walk us
through the evening, please?

05:31.042 --> 05:32.175
I don't know what to tell you.

05:32.210 --> 05:37.480
Uh, there were six of us.
We had dinner at the Pump Room.

05:37.515 --> 05:41.985
It was my birthday.
Lots of wine, lots of laughs.

05:42.019 --> 05:43.186
Did any men come around?

05:43.221 --> 05:47.490
You know, there was this one
kind of creepy guy at the bar.

05:47.525 --> 05:49.326
Nicole swore he was giving her the eye.

05:49.360 --> 05:50.527
Can you describe him?

05:50.561 --> 05:53.663
White guy, wore a hat,

05:53.698 --> 05:55.365
but he never came over.

05:55.399 --> 05:57.367
And then what?

05:57.401 --> 06:00.670
I went home.
But they all went to Jinx's.

06:00.705 --> 06:04.007
I'm too old for Jinx's.

06:04.041 --> 06:05.809
I'm so sorry, Kim.

06:05.843 --> 06:08.311
Nicole was having such a good time.

06:08.346 --> 06:11.248
Yeah. Thanks. Al?

06:12.316 --> 06:14.084
Thank you.

06:16.520 --> 06:18.255
Hey.

06:20.157 --> 06:22.692
Nicole Silver. She was here last night.

06:22.727 --> 06:24.527
Honestly,
the volume of ladies in here...

06:24.562 --> 06:26.229
they all start to blur.

06:26.264 --> 06:28.198
Well, kind of a blur for
the ladies, too, though, right?

06:28.232 --> 06:29.699
I mean, this bar's got a reputation

06:29.734 --> 06:32.202
for serving them shots
until they can't see straight.

06:32.236 --> 06:35.305
- Serving drinks is my job.
- Over-serving drinks is

06:35.339 --> 06:37.240
a violation of the Chicago Liquor Code,

06:37.275 --> 06:39.809
and we know at least one girl
who was over-served last night,

06:39.844 --> 06:42.812
so take another look.

06:42.847 --> 06:46.082
Let me see it again.

06:46.117 --> 06:48.485
There was a group of ladies
that came in late.

06:48.519 --> 06:50.487
- She was one of them.
- Was she with a man?

06:50.521 --> 06:52.389
From what I understand, she
was trying to get away from one.

06:52.423 --> 06:54.157
All right, can you describe him?

06:54.191 --> 06:55.759
No, but the bouncer got a good look.

06:55.793 --> 06:57.193
Hey, Hector!

07:06.904 --> 07:09.839
That's him. The old guy.

07:09.874 --> 07:11.574
Okay. What was the problem?

07:11.609 --> 07:14.244
Lady complained
some creep was following her,

07:14.278 --> 07:16.780
so I told him to get the hell out.

07:16.814 --> 07:18.682
What did he say?

07:20.151 --> 07:22.118
Ooh, Hector.

07:22.153 --> 07:24.587
I didn't expect the old dog
to pack a punch like that.

07:24.622 --> 07:27.257
All right, well,
we're gonna need all the tapes.

07:27.291 --> 07:30.226
Yeah. We won't show anybody.

07:31.829 --> 07:33.430
We were able to get one clean image

07:33.464 --> 07:34.597
from the surveillance footage

07:34.632 --> 07:35.732
to run facial recognition,

07:35.766 --> 07:37.600
and found Arlen Pfister.

07:37.635 --> 07:39.602
Got two priors for domestic abuse.

07:39.637 --> 07:42.105
He beat a man into a coma
in a road rage incident

07:42.139 --> 07:43.573
on the Dan Ryan Expressway,

07:43.607 --> 07:44.908
did a year for aggravated assault.

07:44.942 --> 07:46.710
We showed a photo array to Jasmine

07:46.744 --> 07:48.278
and the bouncer at Jinx's Bar,

07:48.312 --> 07:49.913
and they both ID'd Pfister.

07:49.947 --> 07:51.748
Any other women at the birthday party?

07:51.782 --> 07:53.917
We spoke to everyone
except for Denise Miranda...

07:53.951 --> 07:56.286
we left her a message...
they all said that they saw

07:56.320 --> 07:58.421
an older guy wearing a hat
at the Pump Room.

07:58.456 --> 07:59.789
All right. Call the State's Attorney.

07:59.824 --> 08:01.558
Get a sneak and peek warrant.

08:01.592 --> 08:04.160
We do not want this guy to know
he's on our radar.

08:04.195 --> 08:05.595
Yeah.

08:42.366 --> 08:43.767
Chicago PD!

08:43.801 --> 08:45.668
Oh, I thought you were trying to rob me.

08:45.703 --> 08:48.371
My bad.

08:48.406 --> 08:50.840
You good?

08:50.875 --> 08:53.676
Yeah, I guess.

08:53.711 --> 08:55.912
- Clear.
- Clear.

09:01.685 --> 09:03.520
Al?

09:21.739 --> 09:25.375
Nicole Silver. You've been
following her for two weeks.

09:25.409 --> 09:29.212
The last I checked,
taking pictures wasn't a crime.

09:29.246 --> 09:31.714
Aggravated sexual assault...
last time I checked,

09:31.749 --> 09:33.516
that's a Class 1 felony.

09:33.551 --> 09:37.420
Yeah. It's sad news. It wasn't me.

09:37.455 --> 09:40.223
We've got witnesses saying
that you were stalking her.

09:40.257 --> 09:41.891
And this picture looks like it was taken

09:41.926 --> 09:43.693
from inside her apartment.

09:43.727 --> 09:45.595
Mm-hmm. I know how it looks.

09:45.629 --> 09:48.731
Looks like you're obsessed with her.

09:48.766 --> 09:50.767
Looks like you attacked her last night.

09:50.801 --> 09:53.736
That's how it looks.

09:56.740 --> 09:58.875
Um...

09:58.909 --> 10:02.011
I was hired to find things about her.

10:02.046 --> 10:03.780
I do opposition research.

10:03.814 --> 10:07.584
So, you were hired
by Nicole's estranged husband

10:07.618 --> 10:08.952
to dig up dirt on her?

10:08.986 --> 10:11.554
Well, let's just say
the gloves had come off.

10:11.589 --> 10:13.690
Now, look, since we've
cleared this matter up...

10:13.724 --> 10:15.291
Yeah, I'm not buying it.

10:15.326 --> 10:17.594
Well, I've got a check to prove it.

10:17.628 --> 10:19.295
You see these pictures?

10:19.330 --> 10:21.397
They're really flattering, aren't they?

10:21.432 --> 10:23.566
I mean, I think you're into her.

10:23.601 --> 10:25.468
She's a lovely woman.

10:25.503 --> 10:27.804
Mm. Did you follow Nicole after Jinx's?

10:27.838 --> 10:30.707
I'd already been made. Had to giddy-up.

10:30.741 --> 10:32.575
Do you have an alibi?

10:32.610 --> 10:34.310
Yeah. Massage therapist

10:34.345 --> 10:37.647
by the name of Candi Tempte.

10:37.681 --> 10:39.449
Pretty sure that wasn't her real name.

10:39.483 --> 10:41.084
Yeah, so where were the rest

10:41.118 --> 10:42.452
of the women?

10:42.486 --> 10:43.720
They'd left at that point.

10:43.754 --> 10:45.922
It was just those two right there.

10:48.826 --> 10:50.760
Sarge, can I see you in the hall?

10:54.665 --> 10:55.899
What's up?

10:55.933 --> 10:58.434
Sarge, that is Denise Miranda.

10:58.469 --> 11:00.336
She's one of the women
who was at the birthday.

11:00.371 --> 11:02.906
She's the only one we can't reach.

11:05.609 --> 11:08.077
When was the last time
you spoke to Denise?

11:08.112 --> 11:11.314
I've been calling her all day,
but she doesn't answer.

11:11.348 --> 11:13.983
Something bad has happened to her.
I know it for a fact.

11:14.018 --> 11:16.819
- What makes you so sure?
- Hercules.

11:16.854 --> 11:18.488
Uh, her dog.

11:18.522 --> 11:20.823
It's like her kid.
She hates to leave him alone.

11:20.858 --> 11:23.760
And she sent me
this video message last night.

11:23.794 --> 11:25.828
<i>- Hey, Eric!
- Hi, Eric!</i>

11:25.863 --> 11:27.864
<i>Eric, will you put Hercules inside?</i>

11:27.898 --> 11:29.098
We're going to a party in Wicker Park.

11:29.133 --> 11:30.867
We'll come home right after.

11:30.901 --> 11:33.603
<i>- Come on, let's go.
- I'll be right there.</i>

11:35.539 --> 11:36.773
What time was that at?

11:36.807 --> 11:39.008
Around 1:30 this morning.

11:39.043 --> 11:40.977
She never came home.

11:46.228 --> 11:48.561
All right. We've got a possible
second rape victim.

11:48.596 --> 11:49.896
This is Denise Miranda.

11:49.930 --> 11:51.865
She's 34 years old, works at Macy's,

11:51.890 --> 11:53.146
did not show up to work today,

11:53.171 --> 11:54.887
and we're pinging her phone...
so far, nothing.

11:54.912 --> 11:56.713
After Jinx, they went to Thirsty Raven.

11:56.738 --> 12:00.207
That's where they did
the video message at 1:42 a.m.

12:00.410 --> 12:02.945
The car's a black Audi Q7.

12:02.970 --> 12:04.371
The license plate isn't visible,

12:04.413 --> 12:06.714
but somebody's motioning
to get them inside.

12:06.741 --> 12:09.343
Can't see his face,
but it's a white male.

12:09.377 --> 12:10.978
What about Mr. Shutterfly?

12:11.012 --> 12:13.380
Arlen Pfister's alibi checks out.

12:13.415 --> 12:16.717
He put $500 on a Visa
at Gentleman's Choice,

12:16.751 --> 12:21.288
and the... therapist confirms
he had a treatment at 1:30 a.m.

12:21.322 --> 12:22.890
Plus, he drives a Pontiac Aztek.

12:22.924 --> 12:25.459
All right, lodge a BOLO,
file a missing person's report

12:25.493 --> 12:28.295
on Denise Miranda, and get the DMV list

12:28.329 --> 12:30.664
of all black Audi Q7 owners
in the region.

12:30.698 --> 12:32.900
Run it against known sex offenders.

12:32.934 --> 12:36.870
Look, Nicole was attacked
and she was left for dead.

12:36.905 --> 12:38.705
Let's hope her friend is
still out there.

12:38.740 --> 12:40.908
Whoa. Hey.

12:40.942 --> 12:42.643
We got a ping on Denise's phone.

12:42.677 --> 12:44.812
She's at 1227 Langdon Street.

12:44.846 --> 12:46.713
Real strong signal. It's not moving.

12:46.748 --> 12:48.482
Hit it.

13:00.361 --> 13:02.329
So, she should be

13:02.363 --> 13:03.831
a few meters around this spot, right?

13:03.865 --> 13:05.265
Yeah.

13:08.903 --> 13:10.337
Hear that?

13:31.493 --> 13:35.996
I remember it was last call.

13:37.732 --> 13:40.400
These guys bought us drinks.

13:40.435 --> 13:42.536
Can you describe them?

13:43.605 --> 13:45.873
White.

13:45.907 --> 13:49.076
Twenties, I guess.

13:49.110 --> 13:52.713
They looked like every other guy
in the bar.

13:52.747 --> 13:55.749
One had dark hair.

13:55.783 --> 13:58.051
The other was kind of blond.

13:58.086 --> 13:59.887
Okay.

13:59.921 --> 14:03.123
He invited us to a party.

14:03.157 --> 14:06.927
There was something about balloons.

14:06.961 --> 14:08.762
Balloons?

14:08.796 --> 14:12.399
Yeah. There were all these balloons.

14:14.536 --> 14:18.805
The whole thing is like
a nightmare I can't remember.

14:18.840 --> 14:21.441
Uh, do you remember the train station?

14:21.476 --> 14:23.410
Okay, how'd you get there, babe?

14:23.444 --> 14:27.514
It was, uh... it must have been later.

14:27.549 --> 14:31.852
We were... we were in the car.

14:31.886 --> 14:36.523
I was waking up. I was sick.

14:36.558 --> 14:40.427
There were sparks in the sky.

14:40.461 --> 14:42.496
They were coming from the train.

14:44.699 --> 14:46.700
Denise was screaming.

14:46.734 --> 14:48.869
That's what woke me up.
She was screaming,

14:48.903 --> 14:51.138
and she was pulling me from the car.

14:51.172 --> 14:53.040
Okay, so you and Denise...
you got out of the car.

14:53.074 --> 14:56.009
No. I couldn't move.

14:56.044 --> 14:57.811
I think she ran away.

14:57.845 --> 15:01.648
You... you have to talk to Denise.

15:01.683 --> 15:05.485
Nicole, Denise is missing.

15:05.520 --> 15:08.655
She never came home, and, um,

15:08.690 --> 15:10.624
we can't find her.

15:13.595 --> 15:16.163
How could I have been so stupid?

15:17.865 --> 15:19.666
Look at me.

15:19.701 --> 15:22.002
You are not stupid.

15:22.036 --> 15:24.871
You were drugged and you were assaulted.

15:33.514 --> 15:35.082
Nicole and Denise were
at the Thirsty Raven

15:35.116 --> 15:36.750
at roughly 1:30 a.m.

15:36.784 --> 15:39.152
They were approached
by two white males: 20s, 30s,

15:39.187 --> 15:40.687
one dark hair, one blond,

15:40.722 --> 15:42.089
which doesn't narrow it down much.

15:42.123 --> 15:44.091
Atwater and I found Denise's phone

15:44.125 --> 15:45.926
about a mile away
from the Thirsty Raven.

15:45.960 --> 15:48.028
It was wiped clean. No prints.

15:48.062 --> 15:49.930
Patrol's canvassing the area
looking for witnesses,

15:49.964 --> 15:51.898
but they got nothing yet.

15:51.933 --> 15:54.234
Yeah, they tossed the phone
so she couldn't call for help.

15:54.268 --> 15:57.037
Burgess, your sister said
that she saw sparks

15:57.071 --> 15:58.839
- from a train, right?
- Yeah.

15:58.873 --> 16:00.107
I worked a beat on Lake Street,

16:00.141 --> 16:01.608
and the L train there throws sparks.

16:01.643 --> 16:02.776
It's the same line
that runs to the station

16:02.810 --> 16:03.944
where we found your sister.

16:03.978 --> 16:05.112
All right, run all in-service calls

16:05.146 --> 16:06.613
around Lake Street.

16:06.648 --> 16:07.948
We got anything on those cars?

16:07.982 --> 16:11.618
Yeah. The DMV lists
18 black Audi Q7 owners

16:11.653 --> 16:14.955
in Wicker Park... one was accused
of aggravated rape last year.

16:14.989 --> 16:16.857
Guy by the name of Rex Goldwin.

16:16.891 --> 16:19.026
Goldwin. No, I've read
about that douchebag.

16:19.060 --> 16:21.128
He's like a local pickup guru.

16:21.162 --> 16:24.131
He teaches guys how to get laid.

16:24.165 --> 16:26.566
Well, he was arrested by Area North.

16:26.601 --> 16:28.869
The victim said that Goldwin
approached her in a bar,

16:28.903 --> 16:30.971
slipped ketamine in her drink,
and then took her phone.

16:31.005 --> 16:32.639
- Same MO.
- Yeah.

16:32.674 --> 16:33.774
State's Attorney couldn't make the case,

16:33.808 --> 16:35.142
so Goldwin beat the rap.

16:35.176 --> 16:37.911
All right, dig up everything
on this Goldwin.

16:37.945 --> 16:40.814
I want to pay this guy a visit.

16:40.848 --> 16:44.618
Any man is capable of having any woman

16:44.652 --> 16:46.486
at any time.

16:46.521 --> 16:49.589
All you need is game.

16:49.624 --> 16:51.224
Who wants to know a dirty secret?

16:51.259 --> 16:52.826
- I do.
- I do.

16:52.860 --> 16:54.227
What, are we in second grade?

16:54.262 --> 16:56.263
I said, "Who wants to know
a dirty secret?"

16:58.866 --> 17:01.668
Yeah, okay, okay. Well, here it is.

17:01.703 --> 17:03.670
When a woman says no, it does not mean

17:03.705 --> 17:05.137
that the game is over.

17:05.173 --> 17:08.308
It means that the game has started.

17:08.342 --> 17:10.777
And my program will teach you

17:10.811 --> 17:14.013
how to break through a woman's
artificial resistance

17:14.048 --> 17:17.983
and bring her to
her desired state of consent.

17:19.787 --> 17:22.823
We're gonna get into that
right after we break for lunch.

17:22.857 --> 17:24.023
Thank you.

17:25.226 --> 17:27.260
Thank you.

17:30.965 --> 17:33.333
Hey, you got a second?

17:33.367 --> 17:35.869
- Yeah. Want to go back here?
- Yeah. Thanks.

17:35.903 --> 17:38.839
So, every one of those guys
pays 500 bucks?

17:38.873 --> 17:41.875
Heh. I got a message that
the men of today need to hear.

17:41.909 --> 17:43.176
Huh.

17:43.211 --> 17:46.146
To what do I owe this visit?

17:46.180 --> 17:47.781
I'm just... I'm just curious.

17:47.815 --> 17:51.785
I mean, this whole "consent"
thing is a mystery to me.

17:51.819 --> 17:53.220
I mean, how do you tell if a woman's

17:53.254 --> 17:55.655
just pretending to resist?

17:55.690 --> 17:56.790
You're asking as a cop?

17:56.824 --> 17:58.325
No. Man to man.

17:58.359 --> 17:59.993
Well, if that's
all you're interested in,

18:00.027 --> 18:02.863
stick around for the seminar.
I'll comp you.

18:02.897 --> 18:04.831
I can tell that you're intrigued.

18:04.866 --> 18:06.800
But even for an expert like you,

18:06.834 --> 18:08.902
the line's got to get fuzzy.

18:08.936 --> 18:11.171
You were accused of rape last year.

18:11.205 --> 18:13.173
The woman said that you drugged her.

18:13.207 --> 18:15.175
That doesn't sound like consent.

18:15.209 --> 18:17.911
Yeah. That woman said a lot of things.

18:17.945 --> 18:20.013
None of them were true,

18:20.047 --> 18:22.149
which is why the case
never made it to trial.

18:22.183 --> 18:25.719
Mm-hmm. You drive a black Audi Q7?

18:25.753 --> 18:27.020
Yeah. You a car guy?

18:27.054 --> 18:30.257
Only when they're involved in a crime.

18:30.291 --> 18:33.093
So, where were you last night?

18:35.763 --> 18:38.765
My car's parked in the garage.
You're welcome to check it out.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.700
Nah.

18:40.735 --> 18:42.836
You recognize them?

18:44.138 --> 18:46.706
No. I'm not into cougars, my man.

18:46.741 --> 18:48.842
No offense.

18:48.876 --> 18:51.778
I was at the hotel last night

18:51.813 --> 18:54.681
with her.

18:54.715 --> 18:56.183
- Wow.
- She's 21.

18:56.217 --> 18:58.251
Get out.

18:59.654 --> 19:02.389
Hey, can I keep one of these?

19:02.423 --> 19:03.790
Eh, knock yourself out.

19:03.825 --> 19:05.625
Hey, thank you.

19:05.660 --> 19:07.227
Thank you very much.

19:10.064 --> 19:13.233
Hey. Any luck?

19:13.267 --> 19:14.434
I showed Nicole the photo array.

19:14.468 --> 19:15.869
She couldn't pick out Goldwin.

19:15.903 --> 19:18.138
But she doesn't remember any faces.

19:18.172 --> 19:21.241
I got something here.

19:21.275 --> 19:23.143
So, I ran all the in-service calls

19:23.177 --> 19:24.811
around the Lake Street L station.

19:24.846 --> 19:27.447
Patrol responded
to a distraught woman wandering

19:27.481 --> 19:31.051
the 4300 block of Maple
at 3:22 in the morning, okay?

19:31.085 --> 19:32.919
They showed up. She was already gone.

19:32.954 --> 19:35.789
Um, it's mostly abandoned
warehouses in the area.

19:35.823 --> 19:37.324
Hardly any surveillance cameras,

19:37.358 --> 19:39.025
but they were able to pull POD footage.

19:43.164 --> 19:44.931
Is that Denise?

19:47.034 --> 19:48.835
That's her.

19:48.870 --> 19:50.937
There's no cameras after that.

20:12.193 --> 20:13.894
Gate's open.

20:35.216 --> 20:36.850
Jay?

20:55.242 --> 20:57.740
All right, the ME came back
with the preliminary exam

20:57.765 --> 20:59.018
on Denise Miranda.

20:59.044 --> 21:01.319
Unlike Nicole,
no signs of sexual assault.

21:01.344 --> 21:03.111
No defense wounds. But, like Nicole,

21:03.146 --> 21:05.724
alcohol found in her blood,
and high levels of ketamine.

21:05.749 --> 21:07.916
- How'd she die?
- Hypothermia.

21:07.951 --> 21:09.251
She got knocked out by the ketamine,

21:09.285 --> 21:12.187
and then she froze to death.

21:12.222 --> 21:15.390
Hiding from the predators.

21:15.425 --> 21:18.026
I'm telling you this has
Goldwin written all over it.

21:18.061 --> 21:19.695
I've been reading blogs

21:19.729 --> 21:21.063
written by other women
who have been victimized,

21:21.097 --> 21:23.165
and they all have the same story.

21:23.199 --> 21:25.334
They get taken to apartments, drugged,

21:25.368 --> 21:27.870
their phones disappear,
and after they're assaulted,

21:27.904 --> 21:29.838
they get dumped at subway stations.

21:29.873 --> 21:32.174
I hear you, but the crime lab
went through Goldwin's car.

21:32.208 --> 21:34.443
It's clean, and his alibi
checks out for last night.

21:34.477 --> 21:37.112
Right. I'm not saying
he's personally responsible

21:37.147 --> 21:39.915
for this assault,
but he's trained an army

21:39.949 --> 21:41.683
at these seminars of his.

21:41.718 --> 21:44.953
Whoever assaulted Nicole was
following Goldwin's blueprint.

21:44.988 --> 21:47.122
Put a microscope
on Goldwin's organization.

21:47.157 --> 21:49.291
Get a list of all the men
who have attended his seminar.

21:49.325 --> 21:52.161
Burgess, Zoe's father is downstairs.

21:57.133 --> 21:58.867
- Where's Zoe?
- I kept her in the back.

21:58.902 --> 22:00.936
- Thanks, Trudy.
- Hello, Kim.

22:00.970 --> 22:02.905
I came as soon as I heard.
It's just awful what happened...

22:02.939 --> 22:04.206
what the hell?

22:04.240 --> 22:05.974
You hired a private eye
to spy on my sister?

22:06.009 --> 22:07.276
Hey! Hey.

22:07.310 --> 22:08.944
You think she's having affairs like you?

22:08.978 --> 22:10.279
She's the one who started this.

22:10.313 --> 22:12.214
I wanted to mediate,
but she hired a lawyer.

22:12.248 --> 22:14.149
Because you are a scumbag.

22:14.184 --> 22:16.952
You think your sister's a saint?

22:16.986 --> 22:19.454
Just look at what happened last night.

22:22.992 --> 22:24.960
- Last night?
- Yeah.

22:24.994 --> 22:28.263
She's getting wasted in pickup bars.

22:28.298 --> 22:32.334
What kind of a mother puts
herself in that position, huh?

22:32.368 --> 22:34.770
Get out.

22:34.804 --> 22:36.138
Fine.

22:36.172 --> 22:37.906
Where's Zoe? I'm taking her with me.

22:37.941 --> 22:40.142
Zoe stays with me until her
mom gets out of the hospital.

22:40.176 --> 22:41.476
But she's not your daughter.

22:41.511 --> 22:43.512
She is my blood,

22:43.546 --> 22:47.349
and I've got 85 cops in this building

22:47.383 --> 22:49.451
who have her back.

22:51.354 --> 22:53.255
- This isn't over.
- Yeah?

22:53.289 --> 22:55.257
It is for you.

22:57.393 --> 23:00.028
So, we went through the
Effective Pickup online forums.

23:00.063 --> 23:01.997
Some really dark,
nasty stuff on this thing.

23:02.031 --> 23:03.932
I should've been typing
with rubber gloves on.

23:03.967 --> 23:05.834
It's really just a bunch
of anonymous guys bragging

23:05.869 --> 23:07.436
about they got women
to have sex with them.

23:07.470 --> 23:08.804
So, a lot of this might be bluster,

23:08.838 --> 23:10.305
but there is this one post:

23:10.340 --> 23:12.441
"At the Thirsty Raven
at closing time last night.

23:12.475 --> 23:14.176
"Cougars running wild.
I pulled a drunk one,

23:14.210 --> 23:15.878
"dragged her back,

23:15.912 --> 23:17.379
took her anal virginity."

23:17.413 --> 23:18.947
Which sounds like
what happened to Nicole.

23:18.982 --> 23:20.382
When was that posted?

23:20.416 --> 23:22.951
This morning... the blogger's
handle is "Manslut."

23:22.986 --> 23:25.153
We can locate him
through his IP address.

23:25.188 --> 23:27.823
Get an expedited warrant.
Let's find this guy.

23:35.899 --> 23:39.501
Harry Klinsman?
Chicago PD. We need to talk.

23:39.535 --> 23:41.303
- About what?
- Manslut,

23:41.337 --> 23:43.071
and what you were doing last night.

23:43.106 --> 23:44.840
I'm sorry.
I'm in the middle of something,

23:44.874 --> 23:47.142
but if you leave your card,
I'll get back to you.

23:47.176 --> 23:49.144
Sorry about that.
Yes. It's like I said...

23:49.178 --> 23:51.480
Are you sure that's
how you want to play this, man?

23:51.514 --> 23:54.983
I went to law school, okay?
I know my rights.

23:55.018 --> 23:56.818
A thousand apologies.

23:56.853 --> 24:00.022
Um, excuse me. Chicago Police.

24:00.056 --> 24:03.158
Was anybody here with Manslut
last night?

24:03.192 --> 24:05.594
Anybody? Manslut?

24:05.628 --> 24:08.230
- Who's Manslut?
- It's, um...

24:08.264 --> 24:10.065
what do you call it...
it's like his alter-ego.

24:10.099 --> 24:11.266
- I will give you a call back.
- Anybody? Manslut?

24:11.301 --> 24:12.834
All right, all right. Let's talk.

24:12.869 --> 24:14.569
Just don't do that.

24:16.039 --> 24:18.006
- Do you know these women?
- Yeah.

24:18.041 --> 24:20.909
Well, not their names.
I didn't get that far.

24:20.944 --> 24:23.211
How far did you get?

24:23.246 --> 24:25.380
"Can I buy you a drink?"

24:25.415 --> 24:27.416
That's all the game you got
for 500 bucks?

24:27.450 --> 24:30.285
I spent a lot more than that.
I hired two instructors

24:30.320 --> 24:32.421
- for a field session.
- Personal coaching?

24:32.455 --> 24:33.889
Yeah.

24:33.923 --> 24:36.391
Yeah, my assignment was these women.

24:36.426 --> 24:38.927
They told me I needed
to push through the resistance,

24:38.962 --> 24:40.562
but I couldn't get there,

24:40.596 --> 24:44.633
so they swooped in
and showed me how it was done.

24:44.667 --> 24:47.102
After that, I went home.

24:47.136 --> 24:50.038
You posted online that you
took a woman's anal virginity.

24:50.073 --> 24:53.909
That just gets the most points.

24:53.943 --> 24:56.044
What are the instructors' names?

24:56.079 --> 24:58.213
Andrew and Keith.

24:58.247 --> 25:00.282
They'll be at the Thirsty Raven tonight.

25:03.086 --> 25:05.387
Keith Tasker and Andrew Latimer.

25:05.421 --> 25:07.923
We got their names off
the Effective Pickup registry.

25:07.957 --> 25:09.291
Latimer is a barista,

25:09.325 --> 25:11.393
and Tasker works for a tech startup

25:11.427 --> 25:13.261
and leases an Audi Q7.

25:13.296 --> 25:15.397
Yeah, just like his hero, Rex Goldwin.

25:15.431 --> 25:17.299
The Effective Pickup organization

25:17.333 --> 25:19.334
only has four official employees.

25:19.369 --> 25:21.503
These guys are not among them.
But they acknowledge

25:21.537 --> 25:23.305
that so-called "graduates"
take on side jobs

25:23.339 --> 25:24.940
mentoring other men.

25:24.974 --> 25:28.076
Hey, thanks for coming, Ana.
You all know Ana Valdez.

25:28.111 --> 25:31.113
I brought the State's Attorney's
office up to speed.

25:31.147 --> 25:32.981
We want to make sure
we can make this case.

25:33.016 --> 25:34.149
Wait a second. We own these guys.

25:34.183 --> 25:35.283
Why don't we just grab them?

25:35.318 --> 25:36.418
You could certainly question them,

25:36.452 --> 25:37.586
but short of a confession,

25:37.620 --> 25:39.254
it's a very high bar to prove rape

25:39.288 --> 25:41.089
- when alcohol's involved.
- They were drugged.

25:41.124 --> 25:42.491
Or they willingly took a party drug.

25:42.525 --> 25:44.259
Willing? My sister wasn't willing.

25:44.293 --> 25:47.963
- She didn't...
- Hey, Kim, she's on your side.

25:47.997 --> 25:50.198
Look, this whole case turns my stomach.

25:50.233 --> 25:52.601
I'm just making the argument
their lawyer would make.

25:52.635 --> 25:54.970
We have two victims. One of them's dead,

25:55.004 --> 25:57.039
and the other one can't
ID her attackers,

25:57.073 --> 25:59.341
and there's no physical evidence
tying them to Nicole's rape.

25:59.375 --> 26:02.044
Okay. This is not a first time
for these two.

26:02.078 --> 26:03.378
I mean, they have an MO.

26:03.413 --> 26:05.113
Great. If we can prove an MO,

26:05.148 --> 26:06.648
it's easier to hang
assault charges on them.

26:06.682 --> 26:08.216
You know, one thing about these guys is

26:08.251 --> 26:10.118
they don't know that Denise is dead.

26:10.153 --> 26:11.453
I mean, she ran from the car.

26:11.487 --> 26:13.622
As far as they know, she went home.

26:13.656 --> 26:15.957
That's true. I mean,
these guys can be out right now

26:15.992 --> 26:18.493
or tonight on the hunt like
nothing ever happened, Sarge.

26:22.765 --> 26:25.734
Erin, go down and talk to Platt.

26:25.768 --> 26:27.969
Find a female officer
to partner up with.

26:28.004 --> 26:29.337
The rest of you meet in the roll up.

26:29.372 --> 26:31.173
We're going undercover.

26:31.207 --> 26:33.275
- Thank you for coming.
- I'm sorry I couldn't do more.

26:43.186 --> 26:45.220
- Sarge?
- Yeah?

26:45.254 --> 26:47.255
I want to go undercover with Lindsay.

26:47.290 --> 26:50.025
I don't think it's the right fit, Kim.

26:50.059 --> 26:51.526
It's the perfect fit.

26:51.561 --> 26:53.228
I know the case,
I work well with Lindsay,

26:53.262 --> 26:56.198
and I'm the right gender.

26:56.232 --> 26:57.699
You're too close to this.

26:57.733 --> 27:01.369
Like you were too close to Justin?

27:01.404 --> 27:03.271
Careful.

27:03.306 --> 27:05.273
Just because it's our family
does not mean

27:05.308 --> 27:07.342
we can't do our job.

27:13.483 --> 27:15.417
So, go get changed.

27:28.180 --> 27:29.539
All right, we just need to make sure

27:29.555 --> 27:31.322
the camera's always facing out.

27:31.357 --> 27:33.624
Yep.

27:33.649 --> 27:36.661
Okay, we know these guys like
to come in at last call,

27:36.695 --> 27:38.496
target the most available women.

27:38.531 --> 27:40.698
Their MO is to slip drugs
into cocktails,

27:40.733 --> 27:42.910
so nobody drinks anything
under any circumstances.

27:42.935 --> 27:44.502
- We clear?
- Copy.

27:44.537 --> 27:46.337
You want us to grab them
after they spike the drinks?

27:46.372 --> 27:47.505
No. We're gonna wait for them

27:47.540 --> 27:48.940
to cross the line of consent first.

27:48.974 --> 27:51.776
Till that happens,
we just keep eyes on them.

27:51.810 --> 27:54.646
All right, choose a safe word.

27:54.680 --> 27:57.515
Bluebell.

27:57.550 --> 28:00.351
It's my sister's favorite ice cream.

28:00.386 --> 28:03.221
Bluebell. We're ready outside.

28:03.255 --> 28:05.190
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

28:05.224 --> 28:07.292
You might not believe it,
but I used to go undercover

28:07.326 --> 28:08.860
as a streetwalker 20 years ago.

28:08.894 --> 28:10.562
Hmm.

28:10.596 --> 28:12.897
Okay, 25 years ago.

28:12.932 --> 28:15.366
I don't know if this is
really my shade, Sarge.

28:15.401 --> 28:18.703
Yeah, but you might just need
a little touch-up.

28:18.737 --> 28:21.773
- Ohh.
- Good luck.

28:23.375 --> 28:24.809
Okay.

28:33.352 --> 28:34.719
I want to buy you a drink.

28:34.753 --> 28:36.821
Oh, we're good.
We're waiting for someone.

28:36.855 --> 28:38.556
Oh, okay. Cool.
Well, I will keep you company.

28:38.591 --> 28:40.391
She said we're good.

28:40.426 --> 28:41.960
Whatever.

28:43.596 --> 28:44.929
Is this what single life is like?

28:44.964 --> 28:47.532
On Division Street at 1:00 a.m. it is.

28:47.566 --> 28:49.334
Great.

28:51.937 --> 28:53.738
Have a good time.

28:53.772 --> 28:55.607
Thanks for coming tonight. Thank you.

28:55.641 --> 28:58.509
All right. Enjoy yourself.

28:58.544 --> 29:00.878
Hey. What's up, fellas?

29:00.913 --> 29:03.648
Lot of talent here tonight.
Thanks for coming out.

29:04.883 --> 29:06.818
Frick and Frack just walked in.

29:12.591 --> 29:15.360
Yeah, man, might have to try that out.

29:20.833 --> 29:24.435
They locked onto somebody else.

29:24.470 --> 29:26.404
I got this.

29:28.907 --> 29:30.775
- Jill! Jill.
- What?

29:30.809 --> 29:32.577
Hey, I haven't seen you in forever.

29:32.611 --> 29:33.878
What are you doing? I'm not Jill.

29:33.912 --> 29:35.780
Hey, listen. I'm a police officer.

29:35.814 --> 29:38.750
Those guys you're talking to...
you don't want to know them.

29:38.784 --> 29:40.785
All right?

29:40.819 --> 29:44.622
Take this, grab a cab,
take yourself home.

29:44.657 --> 29:46.357
I'm doing you a favor. I promise.

29:50.996 --> 29:54.299
<i>You girls look lonely. And thirsty.</i>

29:54.333 --> 29:56.734
<i>- Is it that obvious?
- Contact.</i>

29:56.769 --> 29:58.336
What have you been up to tonight?

29:58.370 --> 30:00.638
Oh, we had our girlfriend's
bachelorette party.

30:00.673 --> 30:02.407
Cheers to being single.

30:02.441 --> 30:03.408
What's up?

30:03.442 --> 30:05.310
Last call!

30:05.344 --> 30:06.911
Uh, if you two are still at the bar,

30:06.945 --> 30:08.680
I'm guessing that you don't
want the night to end.

30:08.714 --> 30:10.415
Am I right?

30:10.449 --> 30:11.916
I don't know. What do you have in mind?

30:11.950 --> 30:13.918
We know a party in Wicker Park.

30:13.952 --> 30:15.486
That's close.

30:15.521 --> 30:17.922
You girls down?

30:17.956 --> 30:20.858
I don't know. We've had a lot
to drink already, so...

30:20.893 --> 30:23.461
You're fine. Come on.

30:23.495 --> 30:26.130
We can keep this party going
all night long.

30:26.165 --> 30:27.498
Oh.

30:27.533 --> 30:29.634
- Do you wanna?
- Kind of.

30:29.668 --> 30:32.837
- Let's go.
- Okay.

30:32.871 --> 30:34.906
- Okay.
- All right.

30:37.576 --> 30:39.410
Party's on the move.

31:14.780 --> 31:18.049
- Is this your place?
- Share it with some friends.

31:18.083 --> 31:20.084
Uh, let me take your coat.

31:20.119 --> 31:23.721
Wait, where's the party?

31:23.756 --> 31:26.391
Uh, we're the party. We got drinks.

31:26.425 --> 31:28.526
We got music.
We got whatever you may need.

31:28.560 --> 31:32.397
Go ahead. Why don't you
make yourself comfortable?

31:32.431 --> 31:34.465
Okay. All right.

31:35.934 --> 31:39.670
All right. I'll make the drinks.

31:39.705 --> 31:41.139
He took the phones.

31:49.114 --> 31:52.150
- What are those?
- Kamikazes.

31:53.952 --> 31:55.420
Well, aren't you guys gonna have one?

31:55.454 --> 31:57.955
We just did. They're awesome.

31:57.990 --> 32:00.057
Why don't you try one for us?

32:04.563 --> 32:07.765
- Mm...
- What's the matter?

32:07.800 --> 32:10.935
Nothing. I think I'd rather smoke pot.

32:10.969 --> 32:12.203
<i>Do you guys have any pot?</i>

32:12.237 --> 32:14.539
<i>Oh, come on. Drink it for me.</i>

32:17.976 --> 32:19.777
I'm not getting a good feeling
about this.

32:19.812 --> 32:21.546
What's going on, guys?

32:21.580 --> 32:24.449
Do you girls want to party,
or don't you?

32:24.483 --> 32:27.885
Yeah, totally. I just...

32:31.123 --> 32:34.959
That's my girl.

32:35.994 --> 32:37.228
Oh, what is she doing?

32:37.262 --> 32:38.896
On my order.

32:41.633 --> 32:44.635
That was, uh, really strong.

32:44.670 --> 32:46.137
Well...

32:46.171 --> 32:49.207
- You okay?
- Yeah.

32:51.176 --> 32:53.277
Do you have, like,
a bathroom or something?

32:53.312 --> 32:56.781
Yeah, yeah, just down the hall.

32:56.815 --> 33:00.051
<i>Okay, we've had so much to drink.</i>

33:25.043 --> 33:26.777
I was wondering where you went.

33:28.680 --> 33:30.581
Let's have some fun.

33:32.084 --> 33:35.319
- I don't want this.
- Oh, sure you do.

33:35.354 --> 33:36.888
- Hey.
- Stop.

33:36.922 --> 33:38.222
What? Why are you so uptight?

33:38.257 --> 33:39.857
Didn't you hear me say no?

33:39.892 --> 33:42.326
I heard you. I just don't believe you.

33:42.361 --> 33:44.896
Aah! Bluebell!

33:44.930 --> 33:46.564
Let's go.

33:52.371 --> 33:54.038
Aah!

33:55.040 --> 33:56.340
Chicago PD! Get down!

33:56.375 --> 33:57.875
Stay down!

33:57.910 --> 33:59.677
- Where's Kim?
- She's in the back. Go.

33:59.711 --> 34:00.811
Kim!

34:15.893 --> 34:17.594
Kim. Kim. Kim.

34:17.629 --> 34:18.829
Kim! Kim, Kim, Kim!

34:18.864 --> 34:20.063
We got it. We got it.

34:20.098 --> 34:23.067
We've got it. We got it. We got it.

34:24.937 --> 34:27.004
Kim, hey, are you all right?

34:27.039 --> 34:28.606
I need to get to Med.

34:28.639 --> 34:30.206
She's got to have her stomach pumped.

34:46.523 --> 34:48.226
This is entrapment.

34:48.425 --> 34:51.025
And just so you know,
I'm gonna sue the CPD.

34:52.228 --> 34:53.762
Getting stabbed by a cop...
what's that worth?

34:53.795 --> 34:56.063
A few million?

34:56.098 --> 34:59.024
You're here about last night.

34:59.835 --> 35:02.804
These two women.
They were at your apartment.

35:02.838 --> 35:05.807
Look at me.

35:05.841 --> 35:08.109
What happened?

35:08.144 --> 35:10.812
They came over. We partied.

35:10.846 --> 35:12.681
She was raped.

35:12.715 --> 35:14.316
Just 'cause she woke up
feeling guilty about it

35:14.350 --> 35:15.784
doesn't mean she was raped.

35:15.818 --> 35:18.553
She woke up in the hospital
with internal injuries.

35:18.588 --> 35:20.989
She was in surgery for 2 1/2 hours.

35:21.023 --> 35:24.492
Me and her were both drunk.
She wanted rough sex,

35:24.527 --> 35:27.529
and there's no way
anyone can tell me she didn't.

35:31.534 --> 35:33.702
I'm not saying another word
without a lawyer.

35:35.705 --> 35:38.840
There was no plan.
We met two girls and we partied.

35:38.874 --> 35:40.909
What's wrong with that?

35:40.943 --> 35:43.712
You separated them, and then
you took their cell phones

35:43.746 --> 35:45.380
so that they couldn't call for help.

35:45.414 --> 35:47.015
It was a joke.

35:47.049 --> 35:50.585
Look, I admit that I was drunk,
but I didn't hurt anybody.

35:50.620 --> 35:51.886
Did you drug their drinks?

35:51.921 --> 35:54.856
It's called a kamikaze. Women dig them.

35:54.890 --> 35:56.858
So, they asked to be drugged?

35:56.892 --> 35:59.661
Look, the reason
they came back with us is

35:59.695 --> 36:01.162
'cause they wanted to party, okay?

36:01.197 --> 36:03.465
Can someone tell me
what's going on here?

36:06.602 --> 36:08.737
Nicole was raped.

36:12.642 --> 36:14.843
Well, n-not by me.

36:14.877 --> 36:17.078
No, no. She was with Tasker.
They went into the bedroom.

36:17.113 --> 36:18.880
Did you know what was going on?

36:18.914 --> 36:21.049
Look, whatever happened in
that room... it wasn't me, okay?

36:21.083 --> 36:24.085
I never touched either one of them.

36:24.120 --> 36:26.021
Her, okay? Ask her. She'll tell you.

36:26.055 --> 36:27.856
All I did was drive her home.

36:27.890 --> 36:29.924
You sure you drove her home?

36:31.427 --> 36:33.628
Uh... we were gonna
drop them off at the L,

36:33.663 --> 36:36.064
but she... she jumped out of the car.

36:36.098 --> 36:37.966
Hmm. Do you have any idea why?

36:38.000 --> 36:39.567
You'll have to ask her.

36:39.602 --> 36:41.770
Yeah, we can't ask Denise Miranda,

36:41.804 --> 36:44.105
because she died this morning.

36:44.140 --> 36:46.574
What?

36:46.609 --> 36:48.043
Yeah.

36:48.077 --> 36:49.577
She had a really bad reaction

36:49.612 --> 36:51.613
to that kamikaze you gave her,

36:51.647 --> 36:54.983
and after she escaped your car,

36:55.017 --> 36:57.719
she froze to death,

36:57.753 --> 37:00.822
so you're not
just an accessory to a rape.

37:00.856 --> 37:02.924
You're looking at a murder.

37:04.960 --> 37:06.494
No. No, no.

37:06.529 --> 37:09.164
I... I didn't do...
I didn't do anything.

37:09.198 --> 37:10.465
No. She wanted...

37:10.499 --> 37:12.734
She wanted what, exactly?

37:12.768 --> 37:15.070
She wanted to be kidnapped?

37:15.104 --> 37:17.605
She wanted to be drugged
without her knowledge?

37:17.640 --> 37:19.808
What she wanted was
to get away from you,

37:19.842 --> 37:22.077
- so badly that she died!
- Erin.

37:22.111 --> 37:23.745
I'm fine.

37:29.652 --> 37:31.720
It was just supposed to be fun.

37:35.057 --> 37:36.825
Jesus.

37:43.966 --> 37:46.034
Why are you in a hospital gown?

37:46.068 --> 37:49.037
It's a really long story.

37:49.071 --> 37:51.139
Um...

37:53.576 --> 37:57.545
We got the guys who attacked you,

37:57.580 --> 38:00.849
so they're never gonna
hurt anybody ever again.

38:04.153 --> 38:06.054
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

38:06.088 --> 38:08.123
Kim,

38:08.157 --> 38:10.725
what am I supposed to do now?

38:10.760 --> 38:12.560
You're gonna get better,

38:12.595 --> 38:14.162
and you're gonna put it behind you.

38:14.196 --> 38:17.699
How? How?

38:19.568 --> 38:21.302
And how am I supposed
to take care of my daughter

38:21.337 --> 38:24.139
when I don't even feel safe
leaving the house?

38:26.342 --> 38:28.355
Nicole,

38:28.711 --> 38:31.769
I'm gonna help you through this.

38:32.014 --> 38:33.957
I will.

38:34.216 --> 38:36.230
Yeah.

38:37.353 --> 38:41.227
- Mom?
- Hi.

38:41.357 --> 38:42.953
Hi, sweetie.

39:03.746 --> 39:05.914
Knew I'd see you again.

39:07.750 --> 39:11.219
We arrested two of your
disciples for sexual assault.

39:11.253 --> 39:15.790
- Wow. That's horrible.
- Uh-huh.

39:15.825 --> 39:18.059
But that has nothing to do with me.

39:18.093 --> 39:21.563
You teach men how to rape.

39:21.597 --> 39:25.300
I teach men to find their power.

39:25.334 --> 39:27.302
Apparently these guys took it too far,

39:27.336 --> 39:28.937
but here's the thing:

39:28.971 --> 39:32.106
men... we're wired to conquer women.

39:32.141 --> 39:34.209
It's our animal instinct.

39:34.243 --> 39:36.644
That's how our species endures.

39:36.679 --> 39:39.113
Help...

39:40.416 --> 39:42.984
Here's how I see it:

39:43.018 --> 39:45.053
men and women...

39:45.087 --> 39:48.923
we endure because we care
for each other.

39:48.958 --> 39:50.592
We need each other.

39:52.127 --> 39:57.298
When we find predators
who seek to prey on us,

39:57.333 --> 39:59.400
we eliminate them.

40:12.181 --> 40:16.918
You teach another one of
your rape seminars in my city,

40:16.952 --> 40:20.288
I will find you,

40:20.322 --> 40:23.324
and we will settle this like animals.

40:44.013 --> 40:45.146
You wanted to see me?

40:45.180 --> 40:47.081
Yeah. Come on in.

40:50.185 --> 40:52.954
You feel better?

40:52.988 --> 40:54.155
Yeah.

40:54.189 --> 40:56.824
Good.

40:56.859 --> 41:00.161
Now, what the hell
were you thinking out there?

41:00.195 --> 41:02.330
I gave a clear order. You went off-book.

41:02.364 --> 41:05.667
But those guys were getting suspicious.

41:05.701 --> 41:08.336
I mean, I could feel
everything was going south.

41:08.370 --> 41:11.472
I had to do something; I had
to do something to make sure

41:11.507 --> 41:15.343
that they went far enough
that no lawyer could save them.

41:15.377 --> 41:18.746
Sergeant, I did what I had to do.

41:18.781 --> 41:20.848
You know what?

41:23.886 --> 41:26.387
You think like a cop
that belongs up here.

41:31.894 --> 41:36.397
And I've been doing a lot
of soul searching.

41:36.432 --> 41:41.035
Ever since we were kids,
Nicole has looked out for me.

41:41.070 --> 41:43.938
She has always had my back
no matter what.

41:43.973 --> 41:48.076
And now it's my big sister...
she's the one who needs help.

41:51.814 --> 41:54.215
Sarge, I'm all she's got.

41:54.249 --> 41:56.184
So...

41:56.218 --> 41:58.252
I have comp days I can add
to my furlough. I can...

41:58.287 --> 42:00.355
Take all the time you need.

42:03.258 --> 42:05.326
Thank you, Sarge.
