00:02.635 --> 00:04.636
<i>[Paul] I'm miserable.</i>

00:04.638 --> 00:09.441
<i>And food is the only thing
that helps me with the pain.</i>

00:16.116 --> 00:19.818
<i>[woman 1] Somewhere in
me is this little glimmer of hope.</i>

00:19.820 --> 00:21.887
<i>I just want to be
a normal person.</i>

00:21.889 --> 00:24.289
[pants]

00:32.766 --> 00:36.068
You can't do it and then
I just get mad.

00:36.070 --> 00:40.005
<i>[woman 2] If I don't make a change
now, I'm scared it's going to be too late.</i>

00:42.942 --> 00:46.545
[grunts] No! It hurts!

00:46.547 --> 00:49.148
<i>[woman 3] I refuse
to stop fighting.</i>

00:49.150 --> 00:51.283
<i>I have to do this
for my children.</i>

00:56.956 --> 00:58.757
<i>[man] I'm waiting for as long
as I can handle it.</i>

00:58.759 --> 01:01.226
<i>It just got to be
too much for me.</i>

01:01.228 --> 01:04.163
<i>A ten piece nugget
and a large chocolate shake.</i>

01:30.423 --> 01:31.990
[sighs]

01:36.796 --> 01:39.131
<i>[Paul] I never thought my life
would be like this.</i>

01:39.899 --> 01:42.768
<i>I never thought I'd be
750 pounds</i>

01:42.770 --> 01:45.971
<i>and at my size, I'm miserable.</i>

01:48.741 --> 01:52.811
<i>My back aches
and my knees, my toes.</i>

01:52.813 --> 01:54.713
<i>I mean, everything
on my body it hurts.</i>

01:54.780 --> 01:57.182
[exhales]

01:57.184 --> 02:01.620
<i>The only thing that helps me
with the pain is the food.</i>

02:01.622 --> 02:06.959
<i>And the thought of being able to
eat is what motivates me to get up</i>

02:06.961 --> 02:11.063
<i>and get out of bed because
I have to take a shower.</i>

02:11.065 --> 02:13.932
<i>And that's a painful
ordeal for me.</i>

02:14.000 --> 02:16.101
<i>And I hate it.</i>

02:19.672 --> 02:23.342
<i>Even getting out of bed is hard.</i>

02:23.344 --> 02:27.646
<i>Because I have lymphedema
on both of my legs,</i>

02:27.648 --> 02:31.416
<i>which means my legs
are permanently swollen.</i>

02:38.725 --> 02:42.127
<i>The second I'm up,
I'm already in pain.</i>

02:42.829 --> 02:46.431
<i>And anytime I walk more
than 10 feet,</i>

02:46.433 --> 02:48.567
<i>I can't even catch my breath.</i>

02:48.569 --> 02:52.771
I'm exhausted all the time.

02:52.773 --> 02:56.375
<i>And I almost can't fit through
the door to the bathroom</i>

02:56.377 --> 02:57.576
<i>or the shower.</i>

02:57.578 --> 03:00.779
<i>So, I have to move carefully
so I don't get stuck</i>

03:00.781 --> 03:02.948
<i>or trip and fall.</i>

03:02.950 --> 03:07.786
<i>Anybody that's my size,
the biggest fear is slipping.</i>

03:07.788 --> 03:10.689
If I fell I'd have to call 911.

03:10.691 --> 03:14.326
<i>But, no matter what,
I can't be up for long.</i>

03:14.328 --> 03:17.763
<i>I may be able to stand
for 10 minutes at the most.</i>

03:17.765 --> 03:20.832
<i>If I'm not leaning against
something and I just have</i>

03:20.834 --> 03:22.668
<i>to give up and get out.</i>

03:22.670 --> 03:25.704
<i>I don't feel like my body's
ever clean</i>

03:25.706 --> 03:28.941
<i>and that depresses me
because I am ashamed</i>

03:28.943 --> 03:32.978
<i>to have let my life get
to the point to where</i>

03:32.980 --> 03:34.846
<i>I can't even clean myself, like,</i>

03:34.848 --> 03:39.418
I need every day.
I try to shower every day.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.553
<i>Sometimes, I don't,
sometimes it's twice a week</i>

03:41.555 --> 03:44.223
<i>and makes me feel disgusting.</i>

03:46.693 --> 03:49.428
<i>So, I hate the whole process
of taking a shower</i>

03:49.430 --> 03:50.829
<i>and getting dressed.</i>

03:50.831 --> 03:55.567
<i>I'm in so much pain afterwards,
I can barely get dressed.</i>

03:55.569 --> 03:59.871
<i>I basically wear the same
thing every day</i>

03:59.873 --> 04:04.710
<i>because I can only wear what's
easiest to put on at this point.</i>

04:04.712 --> 04:06.845
<i>So, I can't wear pants at all.</i>

04:06.847 --> 04:10.682
<i>Because of the swelling,
it's out of control.</i>

04:10.684 --> 04:14.820
<i>So, during the day,
I have to wear special socks</i>

04:14.822 --> 04:16.688
<i>to keep the swelling down.</i>

04:16.690 --> 04:18.824
<i>But, it's hard to wrap them
on my own.</i>

04:18.826 --> 04:24.196
<i>It's the one part I have
to get help from my mom to do.</i>

04:24.998 --> 04:27.599
-It's been a night. How are you this morning?
-Good.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.401
- Love you.
- Love you.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.336
Will you help me put
my socks on, please?

04:31.904 --> 04:35.440
<i>I live with my mom,
so she can help me</i>

04:35.442 --> 04:37.843
<i>and that makes me feel
really bad,</i>

04:37.845 --> 04:41.413
<i>that she has to basically
take care of me all the time.</i>

04:43.816 --> 04:45.784
<i>[Teresa] I love Paul.</i>

04:45.786 --> 04:48.420
As much love as god could
give you to give somebody.

04:48.422 --> 04:49.988
<i>I'm always worried about him.</i>

04:49.990 --> 04:55.394
<i>He's just gotten so extremely
large, that it's out of hand.</i>

04:55.396 --> 04:59.765
<i>His legs are so tight,
so badly tight 'cause</i>

04:59.767 --> 05:02.934
<i>his weight did a thing on it
and made it</i>

05:02.936 --> 05:04.303
<i>to where the blood doesn't flow.</i>

05:04.305 --> 05:07.572
<i>So, Paul stays swollen and he
needs his compression socks,</i>

05:07.574 --> 05:10.642
<i>but he can't bend over
and put 'em on himself.</i>

05:10.644 --> 05:13.412
<i>So, if I ain't doing it,
then it ain't getting done.</i>

05:13.414 --> 05:16.181
<i>You see what I mean,
because he's too big to do it.</i>

05:16.716 --> 05:19.351
- All right, there you go.
- [sighs]

05:22.055 --> 05:27.826
<i>So, by the time I'm dressed,
I'm in pain and exhausted</i>

05:27.828 --> 05:30.228
<i>and I feel like a failure.</i>

05:30.697 --> 05:34.833
<i>And how I deal
with that is I eat.</i>

05:34.835 --> 05:39.004
<i>And that's when my day
starts to turn around.</i>

05:39.939 --> 05:44.042
<i>You know, after I get dressed
I make it to the couch</i>

05:44.044 --> 05:47.946
<i>in the living room and that's
where I stay for the rest of the day</i>

05:47.948 --> 05:50.115
<i>and all I do is eat because...</i>

05:50.117 --> 05:52.184
Food makes me happy.

05:52.186 --> 05:53.051
Are you hungry?

05:53.053 --> 05:54.786
Yeah.

05:54.788 --> 05:56.221
Want me to make you an omelet?

05:56.723 --> 05:57.689
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

05:57.691 --> 06:01.660
Maybe some ham and some toast.

06:01.662 --> 06:05.130
-And maybe some juice.
-Yeah, I got orange juice. I love ya.

06:06.299 --> 06:11.169
<i>And it takes everything bad
and makes it go away.</i>

06:11.171 --> 06:15.340
<i>I feel like there's an empty
space there when it's not food.</i>

06:15.342 --> 06:20.278
<i>So, food is everything to me
and that all started a long time ago.</i>

06:22.815 --> 06:26.818
<i>From as far back as I can
remember, I've always been big.</i>

06:26.820 --> 06:29.087
<i>My dad was 400 pounds.</i>

06:29.089 --> 06:31.656
<i>And my mom was overweight too.</i>

06:31.658 --> 06:34.760
<i>So, we all were big
and I think that was partly</i>

06:34.762 --> 06:37.396
<i>because my mom is such
a good cook.</i>

06:38.564 --> 06:41.767
<i>My mom's goal was
to make us happy,</i>

06:41.769 --> 06:44.870
<i>so she was always feeding us
and that's how she showed us</i>

06:44.872 --> 06:46.404
<i>she loved us.</i>

06:46.406 --> 06:51.410
<i>And I just constantly wanted to
eat and I never wanted to stop.</i>

06:51.677 --> 06:54.846
<i>So, food was everything.</i>

06:54.848 --> 07:00.352
<i>But then when I was seven,
things at home started to change.</i>

07:01.854 --> 07:03.655
<i>My parents started
to fight a lot more.</i>

07:03.657 --> 07:06.758
<i>They often wouldn't see each
other for days</i>

07:06.760 --> 07:10.262
<i>because they were always
working to make ends meet.</i>

07:10.264 --> 07:13.398
<i>So, I think they would
fight because of that.</i>

07:13.400 --> 07:18.403
<i>And so, when I was around 10,
they got a divorce and my dad left.</i>

07:18.405 --> 07:22.340
<i>So, I just ate and ate
to make me feel better.</i>

07:22.342 --> 07:26.845
<i>And by the time I was 11,
I was already over 200 pounds.</i>

07:26.847 --> 07:31.950
<i>So that's when it started
to get really hard at school.</i>

07:36.989 --> 07:40.659
<i>I was an outcast
and I was lonely a lot.</i>

07:40.661 --> 07:43.562
<i>So, food was my friend.</i>

07:43.564 --> 07:45.697
<i>But I also started to hang
around the people</i>

07:45.699 --> 07:48.533
<i>at the carnival
where my dad worked,</i>

07:48.535 --> 07:51.803
<i>when I see him and they
never made me feel rejected.</i>

07:51.805 --> 07:54.806
<i>Because they considered me
like family.</i>

07:54.808 --> 07:57.843
<i>My dad was a third generation
carnival worker.</i>

07:57.845 --> 07:59.644
<i>It was like the family business</i>

07:59.646 --> 08:02.814
<i>and the carnival was my family.</i>

08:02.816 --> 08:05.517
<i>So, I really didn't hang out
with anybody my age.</i>

08:05.519 --> 08:08.487
<i>I preferred older people
for a while.</i>

08:08.489 --> 08:12.891
<i>But that changed when I was 12
because when my mom worked,</i>

08:12.893 --> 08:15.160
<i>she would have a friend
of the family watch us.</i>

08:15.162 --> 08:16.962
<i>And one day...</i>

08:20.633 --> 08:25.370
<i>And so we were going to the
beach and he started to rub on me.</i>

08:26.005 --> 08:29.407
<i>And then decided to whip out...</i>

08:29.409 --> 08:33.411
his private and started to.

08:33.413 --> 08:36.448
And I told him at the time
to put it away.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.017
And...

08:39.986 --> 08:41.453
that I wanted to go home.

08:41.455 --> 08:45.824
<i>And basically, he told me you
don't tell nobody else, you know.</i>

08:45.826 --> 08:48.593
<i>If so, then I'll deny it,
you're a child,</i>

08:48.595 --> 08:50.695
<i>nobody's gonna believe you.</i>

08:50.697 --> 08:53.665
<i>So, after that I stopped
trusting a lot of adults</i>

08:53.667 --> 08:57.736
<i>because of that
and what it did to me.</i>

08:57.738 --> 09:00.672
<i>'Cause I felt like I could've
stopped it if I said something,</i>

09:00.674 --> 09:02.641
<i>but I just kept quiet</i>

09:02.643 --> 09:06.478
<i>and just used food
to forget about what happened.</i>

09:06.480 --> 09:11.349
<i>And by the time I was 14,
I weighed 475 pounds.</i>

09:12.952 --> 09:15.554
<i>Food then in high school
became a problem.</i>

09:15.556 --> 09:18.623
<i>That's the age when
everyone starts to date.</i>

09:18.625 --> 09:22.627
<i>I wanted a girlfriend, but
girls didn't want the fat guy.</i>

09:22.629 --> 09:25.797
<i>So, I just kept to myself
and continued to eat more</i>

09:25.799 --> 09:27.732
<i>and food was all I cared about.</i>

09:27.734 --> 09:29.634
<i>I didn't even care about
my grades.</i>

09:29.636 --> 09:33.171
<i>My grades got so poor,
they held me back then.</i>

09:33.173 --> 09:36.074
<i>So, by the time I finally
did manage to graduate</i>

09:36.076 --> 09:37.776
<i>I was very happy to leave school</i>

09:37.778 --> 09:39.711
<i>and all that behind me.</i>

09:39.713 --> 09:41.613
<i>Because I wasn't being bullied
every day,</i>

09:41.615 --> 09:43.682
<i>but I knew I needed to work.</i>

09:43.684 --> 09:46.418
<i>So, after high school, I
went into the family business.</i>

09:47.420 --> 09:50.822
<i>I became the fourth generation
in my family to do that</i>

09:50.824 --> 09:53.892
<i>and I loved it 'cause
I felt like I fit right in.</i>

09:53.894 --> 09:57.996
<i>So, I did that fulltime
for the next 12 years.</i>

09:57.998 --> 10:01.366
<i>And I did my job well.
It was a happy place for me.</i>

10:06.772 --> 10:11.810
<i>Fried chicken, baked sausages,
corndogs,</i>

10:11.812 --> 10:14.679
<i>and lots of bread
and fried dough.</i>

10:14.681 --> 10:18.383
<i>I could have any of it
any time I wanted.</i>

10:18.385 --> 10:23.722
<i>And, by the time I was 24
until I was 29,</i>

10:23.724 --> 10:26.858
<i>my weight rose to 600 pounds.</i>

10:26.892 --> 10:28.526
<i>So, that's when my weight</i>

10:28.528 --> 10:31.630
<i>started to become more
of a problem for me.</i>

10:31.632 --> 10:36.868
<i>I had to stop working because it
was too hard to be on my feet for long.</i>

10:36.870 --> 10:40.939
<i>And that was a huge blow
to my morale.</i>

10:40.941 --> 10:43.642
<i>So I just ate more
to forget my misery.</i>

10:43.644 --> 10:47.212
<i>And so I got even bigger.</i>

10:48.381 --> 10:53.952
<i>It was a few years later
when I was 33 that I hit 700.</i>

10:53.954 --> 10:57.889
<i>And shortly after that is when
I had to move in with my mom</i>

10:57.891 --> 11:00.191
<i>because I needed help.</i>

11:00.893 --> 11:03.695
<i>And I couldn't afford a place
on my own</i>

11:03.697 --> 11:06.131
<i>since I couldn't work anymore.</i>

11:09.769 --> 11:14.372
<i>And I hate that I have to
make her sleep on the couch.</i>

11:14.374 --> 11:18.410
<i>So, I feel horrible
and like a failure.</i>

11:18.412 --> 11:22.647
<i>But, the one bright spot in
my life is my girlfriend Jen.</i>

11:22.649 --> 11:25.750
<i>She came into my life
a little over a year ago.</i>

11:25.752 --> 11:29.921
<i>A friend of mine that knew
I was lonely told me about her</i>

11:29.923 --> 11:32.657
<i>and told me
I should reach out to her.</i>

11:32.659 --> 11:34.592
<i>My buddy had told her about me,</i>

11:34.594 --> 11:37.362
<i>and she thought I was funny
and I reached out to her</i>

11:37.364 --> 11:40.398
<i>to be a friend when I
didn't know who she was.</i>

11:40.400 --> 11:44.035
<i>So, from there we started
hanging out and almost a year ago,</i>

11:44.037 --> 11:47.405
<i>I asked her to be my
girlfriend and she said yes.</i>

11:47.407 --> 11:50.909
<i>In a few weeks, it'll be
our one year anniversary.</i>

11:50.911 --> 11:54.579
<i>She's the best thing
that's happened to me.</i>

11:54.581 --> 11:57.148
<i>And having her in my life
is giving me hope</i>

11:57.150 --> 11:59.651
<i>that I still have a chance
at life.</i>

11:59.653 --> 12:00.885
Thank you.

12:00.887 --> 12:03.588
<i>But I know, the biggest
obstacle keeping me</i>

12:03.590 --> 12:06.891
<i>from getting to the life
is my weight.</i>

12:06.893 --> 12:10.328
<i>My whole life revolves
around food.</i>

12:11.664 --> 12:14.299
<i>So, I know it's a death
coming up.</i>

12:14.867 --> 12:17.402
<i>Because my size is killing me.</i>

12:17.404 --> 12:20.405
<i>It's already taken everything
else from me.</i>

12:20.407 --> 12:25.443
<i>And I don't see anyone most
days except my mom and Jen.</i>

12:25.445 --> 12:29.781
<i>And she has to come to me now
if I'm gonna see her.</i>

12:29.783 --> 12:33.017
<i>And so our whole relationship
mostly revolves on her</i>

12:33.019 --> 12:35.453
<i>coming here to eat with me.</i>

12:35.455 --> 12:37.789
<i>She lives an hour
and a half away.</i>

12:37.791 --> 12:40.692
<i>So, I know that's hard
for her to keep doing.</i>

12:40.694 --> 12:42.961
<i>I want to have a future
with Jen.</i>

12:42.963 --> 12:47.465
<i>She makes me happy, but I
know that's not going to happen</i>

12:47.467 --> 12:49.300
<i>the direction I'm headed.</i>

12:50.069 --> 12:53.972
<i>So, I feel like I need
to change my life,</i>

12:53.974 --> 12:56.975
<i>so we could be happy together.</i>

12:56.977 --> 12:59.144
[knocking at door]

12:59.879 --> 13:02.313
- [Jennifer] Hey, hey.
- Hi!

13:02.315 --> 13:05.683
- Oh, it smells good in here.
- Hi, babe, how are you?

13:05.685 --> 13:07.619
- [Jennifer] Good, how are you?
- [Teresa] It's good to see you.

13:07.621 --> 13:10.889
- [laughs] How you doing?
- Good.

13:10.891 --> 13:13.825
- Oh, it smells so good.
- Hi, Booker.

13:13.827 --> 13:16.427
I got hamburgers.

13:16.429 --> 13:17.996
- Hi, babe.
- Hi, babe.

13:18.430 --> 13:20.832
And potatoes and appetizers.

13:20.834 --> 13:24.102
- Good.
- Hey, Punk. What's up, man?

13:24.403 --> 13:27.038
<i>[Paul] She has a son too.</i>

13:27.040 --> 13:30.408
<i>And it makes me so sad
that I can't play sports</i>

13:30.410 --> 13:32.410
<i>with my girlfriend's son.</i>

13:35.080 --> 13:36.681
Thanks, bud.

13:36.683 --> 13:40.985
<i>I can't go for long walks
with my girlfriend.</i>

13:41.620 --> 13:45.023
<i>And I want to change all that.</i>

13:45.025 --> 13:49.027
<i>So, I know I got to change,
so I'm trying to fight</i>

13:49.029 --> 13:50.328
<i>this addiction.</i>

13:51.764 --> 13:54.132
<i>But, I can't do it alone.</i>

13:55.100 --> 13:58.403
I'm feeling like I'm at
a crossroads and I'm scared.

13:58.405 --> 14:01.940
<i>Even though I'm finally
starting to see that</i>

14:01.942 --> 14:03.741
<i>I can have the life
that I wanted.</i>

14:03.743 --> 14:05.743
<i>And I have hope.</i>

14:05.745 --> 14:09.914
<i>My fear is that it could
already be too late for me,</i>

14:09.916 --> 14:13.218
<i>that my body's
too far gone already.</i>

14:13.853 --> 14:16.054
<i>[Teresa] Paul's hit rock bottom.</i>

14:16.056 --> 14:20.158
My son is the size of three men.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.360
<i>But, he only has one heart.</i>

14:23.963 --> 14:27.699
<i>And I'm afraid, I'm afraid
of losing my kid.</i>

14:27.701 --> 14:31.069
<i>Me and Paul are very close
and I would say</i>

14:31.071 --> 14:34.606
<i>if my son doesn't survive,
I will probably lose it.</i>

14:34.608 --> 14:36.241
<i>I don't know.</i>

14:36.243 --> 14:40.411
But I know that I beg God
all the time to let me go first.

14:42.615 --> 14:43.982
I'm not ready to go.

14:43.984 --> 14:47.018
<i>I have so much to live for now.</i>

14:47.020 --> 14:50.588
<i>So, I have to do it now
because if I don't change,</i>

14:50.590 --> 14:52.357
I'm gonna die.

15:05.838 --> 15:09.340
<i>I'm gonna talk to Dr. Now
today on a video call.</i>

15:09.342 --> 15:12.744
<i>To talk to him about
doing his program.</i>

15:12.746 --> 15:16.848
<i>I know I need help in that I have to
get some sort of aid to lose weight</i>

15:16.850 --> 15:18.383
<i>before things get worse.</i>

15:18.385 --> 15:21.386
<i>But, my big concern
is that Dr. Now</i>

15:21.388 --> 15:23.788
<i>is all the way in Houston.</i>

15:23.790 --> 15:27.125
<i>And if I did his program, I don't
know how that'll affect my life.</i>

15:27.127 --> 15:28.826
[Skype ringing]

15:28.828 --> 15:29.661
<i>Hello.</i>

15:29.663 --> 15:31.195
Hello.

15:31.197 --> 15:33.698
<i>Hi, Paul, I'm Dr. Nowzaradan,
how you doing?</i>

15:33.700 --> 15:36.000
I'm good.

15:36.002 --> 15:39.837
<i>So, Paul I understand you want
to get some help to lose weight.</i>

15:39.839 --> 15:41.873
- Yes.
<i>- Okay.</i>

15:41.875 --> 15:43.841
<i>So, Paul, what's
going on with you?</i>

15:43.843 --> 15:46.577
I'm a very large man.

15:46.579 --> 15:53.284
I'm 750 pounds
and I'm in dire need of help.

15:55.621 --> 15:59.123
Yes, I live
in Auburndale, Florida.

15:59.125 --> 16:02.193
<i>And Paul I'm gonna ask you
some questions about your health.</i>

16:04.797 --> 16:06.864
Yes, sir.

16:06.866 --> 16:10.101
<i>You said you are
about 750 pounds.</i>

16:11.070 --> 16:13.071
6'6".

16:14.039 --> 16:17.875
<i>So you have a BMI of 87.</i>

16:17.877 --> 16:21.012
<i>Paul, how far you can walk?</i>

16:22.848 --> 16:24.716
I can walk to the end
of the driveway.

16:24.718 --> 16:28.686
<i>- Okay.
- Maybe 500 feet.</i>

16:28.688 --> 16:31.489
<i>And you get short of breath
walking</i>

16:31.491 --> 16:34.659
<i>or your stamina gives out?</i>

16:34.661 --> 16:40.064
A shortness of breath and
my knees start to give out.

16:40.066 --> 16:44.869
<i>So, you can get around, but
your mobility is severely limited.</i>

16:44.871 --> 16:45.903
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

16:45.905 --> 16:47.338
<i>Okay.</i>

16:55.147 --> 16:57.248
<i>And if you're ready
to lose weight...</i>

17:02.755 --> 17:07.525
<i>But even though it may be safe
for you drive to Houston,</i>

17:07.527 --> 17:10.595
<i>it will put too much strain
on you to go back and forth</i>

17:10.597 --> 17:13.398
<i>and keep making that trip
many different times.</i>

17:18.771 --> 17:23.041
<i>And stay for at least a year
or more to do the program.</i>

17:23.043 --> 17:24.642
<i>- Okay?
- Yes, sir.</i>

17:24.644 --> 17:25.777
<i>So, you think you can do that?</i>

17:25.779 --> 17:28.980
<i>I, I would love
to do the program.</i>

17:28.982 --> 17:32.884
But I need to have some
conversations first about moving.

17:32.886 --> 17:35.153
<i>Conversation with who?</i>

17:35.155 --> 17:36.587
My family and my girlfriend.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.389
<i>Well...</i>

17:48.734 --> 17:52.503
<i>In your situation, if you want
to get help on lose weight,</i>

17:52.505 --> 17:55.440
<i>so that is something that
you need to figure out.</i>

17:55.442 --> 17:58.876
<i>And you need to make
a decision and plan on coming</i>

17:58.878 --> 18:02.713
<i>to see us in Houston
if you want to do my program,</i>

18:02.715 --> 18:04.182
<i>- okay?
- Yes, sir.</i>

18:04.184 --> 18:05.917
<i>And then we go from there, okay?</i>

18:05.919 --> 18:07.985
Yes, sir.

18:14.827 --> 18:17.428
<i>And that means
you're only gonna eat</i>

18:17.430 --> 18:19.897
<i>three times a day
and no snacking.</i>

18:19.899 --> 18:23.434
<i>And you're gonna eat
around 1,200 calories a day.</i>

18:30.742 --> 18:33.111
<i>And you start that diet
right now.</i>

18:35.414 --> 18:37.982
<i>And once you get down here...</i>

18:47.893 --> 18:48.493
<i>Okay?</i>

18:48.495 --> 18:50.294
Yes, sir.

18:53.932 --> 18:57.101
<i>And it won't be easy for you.
You get that?</i>

18:57.903 --> 18:59.370
I do.

18:59.372 --> 19:03.441
<i>Okay, so tell me what do your
eating habits look like right now?</i>

19:03.876 --> 19:06.210
I eat all the time.

19:06.212 --> 19:10.047
I eat lots of sweets
and a lot of food.

19:10.049 --> 19:11.682
I eat a lot of fast food.

19:11.717 --> 19:14.752
A lot of greasy food.

19:14.754 --> 19:19.624
<i>So, you eat because you're
hungry or you eat it from habit?</i>

19:19.626 --> 19:22.760
Um, more of a habit
than anything.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.929
<i>There is no excuse for that.</i>

19:24.931 --> 19:27.565
<i>So, if you're telling me
you're eating to get</i>

19:27.567 --> 19:30.801
<i>over 700 pounds out of habit,</i>

19:30.803 --> 19:33.437
<i>then it's time to change
and break the habit.</i>

19:33.439 --> 19:36.007
<i>- You got that?
- Yes, sir.</i>

19:36.009 --> 19:39.844
<i>Does anyone in your family
enable you to eat like you do?</i>

19:39.846 --> 19:40.778
Not really.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.413
<i>Who do you live with?</i>

19:42.415 --> 19:45.683
I live with my mom
for most of the time.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.418
<i>Does she feed you?</i>

19:47.420 --> 19:51.088
Yes, sir. My mom cooks...
Almost every night, she cooks.

19:51.090 --> 19:54.959
<i>Is your mom helping you
to eat less</i>

19:54.961 --> 19:56.961
<i>or she encourage you to eat?</i>

19:56.963 --> 19:59.363
<i>She puts too much on the plate.</i>

19:59.798 --> 20:01.532
<i>And I don't tell her no.</i>

20:01.534 --> 20:04.001
<i>Well, if you don't learn
to say no,</i>

20:04.003 --> 20:06.404
<i>then you're gonna be 700 pounds.</i>

20:06.406 --> 20:09.807
<i>So, this is not a healthy way.</i>

20:09.809 --> 20:14.845
<i>You know, people like you,
they don't make it to age 40.</i>

20:14.847 --> 20:18.216
<i>And this is very high
risk situation</i>

20:18.218 --> 20:21.953
<i>with all the strain that
you're putting on your system.</i>

20:21.955 --> 20:26.190
<i>Any day, your body can give
out and you're not gonna make it.</i>

20:26.391 --> 20:28.526
<i>And that'll be it for you.</i>

20:28.528 --> 20:32.330
<i>So, you have to realize your
situation is very dangerous</i>

20:32.332 --> 20:34.799
<i>and you have to change
your eating habit</i>

20:34.801 --> 20:40.371
<i>and this is gonna be all up to
you to make that decision, okay?</i>

20:40.373 --> 20:42.907
Yes, sir. I'm ready
to do it, sir.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.141
I'm ready to change.

20:44.543 --> 20:45.409
<i>Okay.</i>

20:45.411 --> 20:47.712
<i>You said that you have
a girlfriend.</i>

20:47.714 --> 20:50.615
<i>Is your girlfriend encourage
you to watch your diet</i>

20:50.617 --> 20:52.750
<i>or what's going on with that?</i>

20:52.752 --> 20:56.887
She tries to watch my diet
and cook better,

20:56.889 --> 21:01.759
but I sometimes just go
eat stuff that I shouldn't eat.

21:01.761 --> 21:05.129
<i>Well, that needs to change
immediately.</i>

21:05.131 --> 21:07.031
- Yes, sir.
<i>- Okay?</i>

21:13.205 --> 21:14.939
<i>And do your exercises.</i>

21:14.941 --> 21:16.407
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

21:22.547 --> 21:25.249
<i>- You understand that?
- Yes, sir.</i>

21:32.524 --> 21:37.762
<i>And that diet
is no carb on your diet.</i>

21:37.764 --> 21:41.866
<i>And high protein
and a lot of vegetable</i>

21:41.868 --> 21:44.802
<i>like a salad or cooked
vegetable on your diet, okay?</i>

21:44.804 --> 21:46.404
Yes, sir.

21:46.406 --> 21:48.973
<i>Well, if you need anything,
give me a call.</i>

21:48.975 --> 21:51.008
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

21:51.109 --> 21:51.842
<i>Okay.</i>

21:51.844 --> 21:54.145
<i>- Bye now.
- Bye.</i>

22:02.921 --> 22:06.157
<i>I know I need to make
my health a priority</i>

22:06.159 --> 22:08.392
<i>like Dr. Now says.</i>

22:08.394 --> 22:11.495
<i>It's just I'm scared about
what Jen is gonna think</i>

22:11.497 --> 22:14.632
<i>and what it's gonna mean
for our relationship.</i>

22:14.634 --> 22:16.567
<i>I just don't want
to mess things up with her</i>

22:16.569 --> 22:20.971
<i>because she's already told me
she wishes we lived closer.</i>

22:20.973 --> 22:25.276
<i>So, this is tough because
both options for me</i>

22:25.278 --> 22:27.611
<i>seems like a big risk.</i>

22:27.613 --> 22:31.015
<i>So, I feel like I just need
to discuss it all with Jennifer</i>

22:31.017 --> 22:33.818
<i>before I make a final decision.</i>

22:33.820 --> 22:37.355
<i>So, I just hope this doesn't
end up messing things up</i>

22:37.357 --> 22:39.323
<i>with us in the end.</i>

22:52.003 --> 22:54.772
<i>Today, I'm headed to Houston
to see Dr. Now in person</i>

22:54.774 --> 22:56.640
<i>to start his program</i>

22:56.642 --> 22:58.175
<i>and to see what I have
to do to get</i>

22:58.177 --> 23:00.211
<i>weight loss surgery with him.</i>

23:00.213 --> 23:01.479
Mom, you ready?

23:01.481 --> 23:04.815
I'm getting there, babe.
Just got my meds.

23:04.817 --> 23:07.618
<i>I don't think my truck will
make it all the way to Houston</i>

23:07.620 --> 23:09.553
<i>and I can't fit in my mom's car,</i>

23:09.555 --> 23:14.658
<i>so I didn't have an option until
my friend JJ offered to take me.</i>

23:14.660 --> 23:17.895
<i>So, I'm thankful she is
willing to be a good friend</i>

23:17.897 --> 23:19.997
<i>and do this to help me out.</i>

23:22.067 --> 23:23.834
Hey!

23:23.836 --> 23:25.669
Hey, JJ in the house.

23:25.671 --> 23:27.204
I'm going to Houston.

23:27.206 --> 23:28.873
You ready for a road trip?

23:28.875 --> 23:29.874
Yes, I'm ready.

23:29.876 --> 23:32.977
I'm Jessica, Paul
calls me JJ though.

23:32.979 --> 23:33.978
It's a nickname
I've had my whole life.

23:33.980 --> 23:35.880
<i>Me and Paul have been
best friends, you know,</i>

23:35.882 --> 23:37.081
<i>pretty much our whole lives.</i>

23:37.083 --> 23:38.983
- What's up, homie? JJ.
- [JJ] Hey.

23:38.985 --> 23:41.152
- Are you excited?
- Oh, yeah.

23:41.154 --> 23:42.253
Oh, I'm so stoked for you.

23:42.255 --> 23:44.989
I'm so excited for him
to go to Houston.

23:44.991 --> 23:47.992
This is gonna be a whole, you
know, chance at a new life for him,

23:47.994 --> 23:50.528
you know, just be able
to live a normal life again.

23:50.530 --> 23:51.796
You guys ready?

23:51.798 --> 23:53.831
- I'm ready you ready, J?
- I've been ready.

23:53.833 --> 23:55.699
All right, we got to load up.

23:55.701 --> 23:57.001
Get your luggage, let's go.

23:57.003 --> 23:58.202
All right, let's go.

23:58.269 --> 24:00.871
<i>[Paul] Overall, I'm nervous
about the trip down there</i>

24:00.873 --> 24:02.640
<i>just because of how long it is.</i>

24:02.642 --> 24:06.610
<i>This is gonna be
a thousand mile trip.</i>

24:06.612 --> 24:11.415
<i>That's a total of 15
to 16 hours of just driving.</i>

24:12.851 --> 24:15.786
<i>But, my big concern is after
a couple of hours,</i>

24:15.788 --> 24:18.823
<i>it's just gonna get too hard
for me.</i>

24:18.825 --> 24:22.693
<i>But, my hope for now
is to divide up the drive</i>

24:22.695 --> 24:24.728
<i>across two days,
so I don't make it</i>

24:24.730 --> 24:26.597
<i>too hard on my body.</i>

24:26.599 --> 24:30.334
<i>But, how I'm going to handle
being in a car for seven</i>

24:30.336 --> 24:33.571
<i>to eight hours at a time,
I still don't even know.</i>

24:33.573 --> 24:36.807
<i>Right now, my plan is
to take it an hour at a time.</i>

24:36.809 --> 24:39.343
- Or you want this in the front?
- Back seat.

24:39.345 --> 24:42.213
This third seat will
probably be better.

24:42.215 --> 24:45.983
<i>If it starts to get too much
for me and I get sore,</i>

24:45.985 --> 24:49.019
<i>I know we can stop
and take breaks.</i>

24:49.554 --> 24:52.022
- All right, all right.
- It's kinda heavy.

24:53.625 --> 24:54.892
<i>And I'm definitely gonna
want to eat</i>

24:54.894 --> 24:57.161
<i>when I can on the way there.</i>

24:58.997 --> 25:01.098
<i>Because this trip down there
to Houston</i>

25:01.100 --> 25:03.501
<i>is kind of my last chance
to eat.</i>

25:03.503 --> 25:04.969
Yeah, I think so.

25:04.971 --> 25:08.138
<i>Because I know when I get
to Dr. Now,</i>

25:08.473 --> 25:11.075
<i>everything is going to change.</i>

25:15.413 --> 25:17.982
<i>We've been on the road
for about an hour and a half.</i>

25:17.984 --> 25:19.416
<i>And I'm starting to feel it.</i>

25:20.919 --> 25:22.119
Hey, guys.

25:22.121 --> 25:24.121
- Yeah?
- I'm hungry.

25:24.123 --> 25:25.322
Can we stop?

25:26.024 --> 25:27.191
Yeah, sure.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.392
Where do you want to stop?

25:28.394 --> 25:30.194
Some fast food.

25:32.831 --> 25:38.035
<i>So, I told JJ I just need
to eat and call it a day.</i>

25:38.303 --> 25:40.704
<i>So, we found a hotel up ahead</i>

25:40.706 --> 25:44.842
<i>and we're getting some fast
food and then going to rest.</i>

25:44.844 --> 25:48.846
<i>Which I'm very happy about
because this has been</i>

25:48.848 --> 25:52.650
<i>so much harder than
I realized it was gonna be.</i>

25:52.652 --> 25:54.351
<i>And it's taking everything
out of me</i>

25:54.353 --> 25:56.687
<i>to even make it this far.</i>

25:56.689 --> 25:59.757
<i>So, I'm disappointed in myself
because we didn't even</i>

25:59.759 --> 26:01.592
<i>make it out of Florida.</i>

26:01.594 --> 26:06.030
<i>We needed to at least make
it to Alabama to stay on track.</i>

26:06.032 --> 26:08.799
<i>But, I did the best
that I could and waited</i>

26:08.801 --> 26:10.935
<i>for as long as I can handle.</i>

26:10.937 --> 26:12.803
<i>It just got to be too
much for me.</i>

26:12.805 --> 26:15.839
I need a double quarter pounder

26:15.841 --> 26:17.975
and then another double
quarter pounder with no pickle,

26:17.977 --> 26:19.476
and no onion.

26:19.478 --> 26:22.413
I need a McDouble,
add Big Mac sauce.

26:22.415 --> 26:25.749
That spicy chicken sandwich,
a 10 piece nugget,

26:25.751 --> 26:29.086
a large fry,
and a large chocolate shake.

26:29.088 --> 26:32.056
And can I get
baker's dozen chocolate chip?

26:32.058 --> 26:34.992
- Mom, you want anything?
- I'll have some of your nuggets.

26:34.994 --> 26:36.393
And an apple fritter.

26:36.395 --> 26:37.995
That'll be it.

26:38.663 --> 26:42.533
<i>And now, I got to make
it to Houston on time.</i>

26:42.535 --> 26:46.737
<i>I'm gonna have to spend, like,
11 hours on the road tomorrow.</i>

26:46.739 --> 26:49.173
<i>I don't know how
I'm gonna do that.</i>

26:50.642 --> 26:54.144
<i>But I'm just trying not to
think about it right now.</i>

26:56.681 --> 26:58.916
<i>Because I'm in so much pain,</i>

26:58.918 --> 27:02.219
<i>I just want to eat
and go to sleep.</i>

27:04.823 --> 27:08.192
<i>At this point, I'm so sore.</i>

27:08.460 --> 27:11.629
<i>And in so much
pain that I'm worried that</i>

27:11.631 --> 27:16.100
<i>it could seriously take me a
whole day to bounce back from this.</i>

27:16.735 --> 27:19.803
<i>But, I'm just trying not
to think about that</i>

27:19.805 --> 27:22.106
<i>or anything
that stresses me out.</i>

27:26.044 --> 27:27.811
Apple fritter.

27:27.813 --> 27:31.081
<i>I just need a bed and to
be able to sleep for a while</i>

27:31.083 --> 27:33.417
<i>and hopefully when I wake up,</i>

27:33.985 --> 27:36.854
<i>I'll feel a lot better.</i>

27:36.856 --> 27:40.491
<i>And I'll figure out some way
to make it to Houston tomorrow.</i>

27:40.493 --> 27:42.159
[Teresa] Oh, here we go.

27:45.697 --> 27:49.733
<i>But so far, this trip
is kicking my butt</i>

27:49.735 --> 27:52.269
<i>and it's just a lot harder
to be in a car that long</i>

27:52.271 --> 27:55.239
<i>than I thought
it was going to be.</i>

27:55.241 --> 28:01.679
<i>I was worried about that but I
didn't know how bad it was gonna be.</i>

28:01.681 --> 28:06.984
<i>Because I can't even remember how long
it's been since I did a trip like this.</i>

28:07.919 --> 28:11.221
<i>So, when I hit that wall
with my body...</i>

28:11.956 --> 28:14.425
<i>Around the third hour
in the car,</i>

28:14.859 --> 28:17.161
<i>it took me by surprise.</i>

28:17.862 --> 28:19.830
<i>And there was a part of me
right then</i>

28:19.832 --> 28:23.801
<i>that started thinking
that this was a mistake</i>

28:23.803 --> 28:27.137
<i>and that I bit off more
than I can chew.</i>

28:27.872 --> 28:31.341
<i>In trying to make this trip
and go this far.</i>

28:36.081 --> 28:40.184
<i>But I know I'm doing this
for an important reason.</i>

28:40.186 --> 28:42.186
<i>So, I have to keep going.</i>

28:44.089 --> 28:46.290
<i>No matter how much pain I'm in.</i>

28:47.959 --> 28:50.961
<i>- Or how hard it is.
- [sighs]</i>

28:52.964 --> 28:54.698
Here. Want to get
your shoes off?

28:54.700 --> 28:57.000
- Yeah.
- Let me help you.

29:00.405 --> 29:03.207
Oh, man, your legs
are so swollen.

29:03.209 --> 29:05.175
[Paul] I'm just gonna go to bed.

29:05.710 --> 29:06.777
It really hurts.

29:06.779 --> 29:08.846
Come on. We'll help you.

29:08.848 --> 29:10.748
- You want to try to get under the blankets?
- Yeah.

29:10.750 --> 29:13.517
<i>And even though I don't know
how I'm gonna figure out</i>

29:13.519 --> 29:17.054
how to push myself to get
<i>to Houston on time.</i>

29:17.056 --> 29:20.023
<i>A whole lot is depending on me
making it.</i>

29:20.025 --> 29:21.258
Here you go, babe.

29:25.230 --> 29:26.396
[exhales]

29:27.766 --> 29:29.767
You guys turn lights off,
please?

29:29.769 --> 29:34.004
- Yeah.
<i>- And getting the chance I need to lose weight.</i>

29:34.006 --> 29:37.241
<i>So whatever it takes,
I'll figure it out.</i>

29:38.877 --> 29:40.344
<i>Because I have to.</i>

29:49.821 --> 29:52.356
<i>Today is gonna be hard.</i>

29:53.525 --> 29:56.994
<i>Somehow, I have to
make it to Houston.</i>

29:58.029 --> 30:02.032
<i>I slept past breakfast
so my mom and JJ went</i>

30:02.034 --> 30:02.666
<i>and got me something.</i>

30:02.668 --> 30:03.934
Hey, son.

30:03.936 --> 30:06.503
[Paul] Thank God, the
food's here. I'm starving.

30:06.505 --> 30:09.506
<i>So, I'm going to have a bite
before I left</i>

30:09.508 --> 30:13.076
<i>and hopefully give me
a little boost to start out.</i>

30:14.612 --> 30:17.080
<i>As soon as I eat,
we're gonna hit the road.</i>

30:17.082 --> 30:18.782
<i>And do our best to get to
Houston today</i>

30:18.784 --> 30:23.387
<i>before my appointment
with Dr. Now tomorrow.</i>

30:23.389 --> 30:26.290
- That's good [bleep].
- How'd you sleep last night?

30:26.292 --> 30:30.194
- Rough.
- Are you still hurting being in the car all day?

30:30.361 --> 30:31.795
Yeah.

30:31.797 --> 30:34.798
<i>The trip I think has been
a lot harder on Paul than</i>

30:34.800 --> 30:36.867
we really expected it to be.

30:36.869 --> 30:38.635
You know, someone 700 pounds,

30:38.637 --> 30:41.071
<i>his size being crammed
in the car,</i>

30:41.073 --> 30:43.907
<i>it's hard on his legs
and it's really rough.</i>

30:43.909 --> 30:47.477
<i>And we're all tired, but I know
it's taken a toll on him worse</i>

30:47.479 --> 30:48.879
<i>and he slept in this morning.</i>

30:48.881 --> 30:51.548
<i>You could just tell his body's
tired and he's hurting</i>

30:51.550 --> 30:54.885
and now I'm really concerned
we're gonna miss this appointment.

30:54.887 --> 30:57.421
<i>Because he slept in longer
than he should have</i>

30:57.922 --> 30:58.822
<i>and I, you know,
could not get him up</i>

30:58.824 --> 31:00.657
<i>and moving him out of bed.</i>

31:00.659 --> 31:02.960
<i>Seems like he's just
dragging today.</i>

31:02.962 --> 31:07.030
And I'm really concerned
and stressed out.

31:07.032 --> 31:08.532
[JJ] I don't mean to rush you
on eating,

31:08.534 --> 31:10.133
but we really got to get going.

31:10.135 --> 31:12.936
We're gonna probably be late
for your appointment, Paul.

31:12.938 --> 31:14.638
- Nah, we'll be good.
- We overslept, like...

31:14.640 --> 31:16.106
We'll be good.

31:16.108 --> 31:17.875
You don't have to eat
all that right now.

31:17.877 --> 31:18.809
You can save some.

31:18.811 --> 31:20.744
Uh-huh, [mumbles]

31:20.746 --> 31:24.548
I feel I'm trying
to pressure him

31:24.550 --> 31:26.383
and push him and...

31:26.385 --> 31:29.419
<i>It's been hard
to get him motivated and going</i>

31:29.421 --> 31:30.787
<i>and, just, I just want
to get on the road</i>

31:30.789 --> 31:32.256
<i>road and get
to this appointment.</i>

31:32.258 --> 31:36.193
And I feel like I'm the only
one really taking it serious.

31:37.829 --> 31:38.996
Paul.

31:38.998 --> 31:41.031
Like, you don't
have to eat all of it.

31:41.033 --> 31:43.667
You don't have
to eat everything there.

31:43.669 --> 31:45.302
I'm hungry.

31:47.171 --> 31:49.673
<i>I'm very concerned
about Paul's eating.</i>

31:49.675 --> 31:52.542
<i>You know, we're on our way
to see the doctor and I know</i>

31:52.544 --> 31:54.645
he really has to start <i>the diet</i>

31:54.647 --> 31:56.780
after, but, I just,
I wish I would see him

31:56.782 --> 31:59.616
trying to put in
the effort now ahead of time.

31:59.618 --> 32:04.855
Um, I had the surgery
and it's really a mental thing.

32:04.857 --> 32:09.826
<i>So, you have to be mentally
prepared to stop yourself from eating.</i>

32:09.828 --> 32:13.063
<i>And it's hard
and I just don't feel like</i>

32:13.065 --> 32:14.932
<i>he's really taking it
as serious as I wish he was.</i>

32:14.934 --> 32:17.601
<i>And I know it's hard,</i>

32:17.603 --> 32:21.605
<i>I do, but he just,
he won't stop eating.</i>

32:21.607 --> 32:24.641
<i>And I try to tell him are you,
are you sure you're so hungry?</i>

32:24.643 --> 32:28.445
Like, and he says yes,
but it just doesn't stop.

32:28.713 --> 32:30.414
And I'm really
getting concerned.

32:31.115 --> 32:33.984
You got me two omelets.

32:35.086 --> 32:36.653
That was all they had.

32:36.721 --> 32:38.355
<i>I'm scared, really scared.</i>

32:38.357 --> 32:41.591
<i>And that Dr. Now isn't
gonna approve the surgery</i>

32:41.593 --> 32:44.594
<i>because he's not gonna see
what he needs to see from Paul.</i>

32:44.596 --> 32:46.596
Like, he wants to see that
you're dedicated

32:46.598 --> 32:50.000
and ready for this change
and he's not gonna want

32:50.002 --> 32:52.970
to waste his time on somebody
that's not gonna put in the effort.

32:57.075 --> 32:58.208
Can we go now?

32:58.643 --> 32:59.609
Yeah.

33:01.612 --> 33:03.847
<i>And I really want this
for him, but I'm,</i>

33:03.849 --> 33:06.383
<i>I'm really worried he's not
gonna get approved for it.</i>

33:07.752 --> 33:09.686
I'm so concerned about him.

33:09.688 --> 33:13.090
And I don't want to lose
my best friend. [sniffles]

33:17.295 --> 33:20.864
<i>[Paul] The one thing that I
do have to look forward to</i>

33:20.866 --> 33:23.066
<i>is the food on the road.</i>

33:23.068 --> 33:27.504
<i>And my plan is to use that to try
and motivate me to push myself</i>

33:27.506 --> 33:29.306
<i>to keep going today.</i>

33:31.809 --> 33:35.879
<i>So, every time I make it
another 100 miles closer</i>

33:35.881 --> 33:37.881
<i>to Houston, I'll reward myself</i>

33:37.883 --> 33:41.385
<i>with something good to eat.</i>

33:43.588 --> 33:46.723
<i>And if I do that around
six or seven times,</i>

33:46.725 --> 33:49.159
<i>I'll be able to make it
to Houston.</i>

33:50.661 --> 33:52.896
<i>I don't know if that's gonna
be enough</i>

33:52.898 --> 33:55.298
<i>to help me deal with the pain.</i>

33:55.733 --> 33:58.735
<i>Especially after a few hours.</i>

33:58.737 --> 34:00.570
<i>But, at least it gives me
something to try.</i>

34:00.572 --> 34:02.973
<i>And do to keep going.</i>

34:02.975 --> 34:06.176
<i>So, hopefully that helps,
but I'll just have to wait</i>

34:06.178 --> 34:06.843
<i>and see how it goes.</i>

34:06.845 --> 34:08.678
<i>And how I handle it all.</i>

34:08.680 --> 34:12.482
<i>I'm just worried because
of how sore I already am</i>

34:12.484 --> 34:15.619
<i>and how hard I know
it's gonna get for me.</i>

34:15.621 --> 34:19.022
<i>But, all I have to do
is keep moving forward</i>

34:19.024 --> 34:23.160
<i>and do my best
and hopefully I can make it.</i>

34:27.765 --> 34:29.299
I'm really tired.

34:30.935 --> 34:32.936
<i>I lasted as long as I can today.</i>

34:32.938 --> 34:35.539
<i>But, I'm at my limit.</i>

34:35.541 --> 34:39.443
<i>So, I told JJ we had to stop.</i>

34:39.510 --> 34:42.813
<i>She wants me to keep going
because we still have</i>

34:42.815 --> 34:45.148
<i>five hours left to go
to get to Houston.</i>

34:45.150 --> 34:47.350
<i>We're about to be in Louisiana.</i>

34:48.953 --> 34:50.353
<i>But, I can't do it.</i>

34:50.855 --> 34:54.024
<i>I have to rest.</i>

34:54.026 --> 34:59.062
<i>I really want to keep going,
but my body just can't take it.</i>

34:59.064 --> 35:00.397
It hurts.

35:01.632 --> 35:03.266
My knees hurt.

35:03.968 --> 35:07.871
<i>I don't know what this is
gonna mean about tomorrow</i>

35:07.873 --> 35:10.440
<i>and my appointment
with Dr. Now.</i>

35:11.976 --> 35:15.045
<i>But, I can't think about it
right now.</i>

35:15.047 --> 35:17.948
<i>I just need to get into bed
and rest.</i>

35:17.950 --> 35:20.117
[grunts]

35:32.130 --> 35:36.133
<i>I've done my best today
and I'm out.</i>

35:36.834 --> 35:39.069
<i>I've got no more in me.</i>

35:40.004 --> 35:42.405
<i>And so I don't know
what we're gonna do</i>

35:42.407 --> 35:44.741
<i>about getting to
my appointment on time,</i>

35:44.743 --> 35:48.111
<i>but I'll figure it out tomorrow.</i>

35:50.281 --> 35:55.018
<i>Because I don't have it in me
to do anything more today.</i>

35:55.186 --> 35:56.419
Mom.

35:58.823 --> 36:00.023
[Teresa] Coming.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.994
<i>I'm just done.</i>

36:17.208 --> 36:22.279
<i>We have a chance of making it to
Dr. Now's in time for my appointment.</i>

36:22.680 --> 36:26.950
<i>My appointment is five
and a half hours from now.</i>

36:26.952 --> 36:31.087
<i>So, that's tight, but we can
make it if we don't stop a lot.</i>

36:31.522 --> 36:33.423
<i>We need to get on the road.</i>

36:33.425 --> 36:37.994
<i>JJ says it'll look bad
and show Dr. Now</i>

36:37.996 --> 36:42.032
<i>I'm not invested in
doing this, but I am.</i>

36:44.669 --> 36:48.705
<i>I'm very invested and I
want Dr. Now to know that.</i>

36:48.707 --> 36:52.842
<i>So, I'm gonna push myself
and try and make it today.</i>

36:52.844 --> 36:56.112
<i>I'm just hoping my body
can handle it.</i>

37:06.090 --> 37:09.593
<i>We made it to Houston
and I'm so very thankful</i>

37:09.595 --> 37:10.760
<i>we're getting close</i>

37:10.762 --> 37:13.663
<i>and it looks like
we're gonna make it.</i>

37:13.665 --> 37:16.800
<i>The appointment's at 1:30
and it's a little past one now,</i>

37:16.802 --> 37:19.903
<i>and we're about 30 minutes away.</i>

37:19.905 --> 37:24.507
<i>So, we may be a little late,
but pretty much on time.</i>

37:24.509 --> 37:27.544
<i>I'm in a lot of pain
because we mostly done</i>

37:27.546 --> 37:29.579
<i>a straight shot down
the interstate 10</i>

37:29.581 --> 37:32.816
<i>to get here with just about
no stopping.</i>

37:32.818 --> 37:35.352
<i>So, I'm really looking forward
to just getting there</i>

37:35.354 --> 37:37.220
<i>and being able to get out.</i>

37:48.766 --> 37:52.736
<i>My legs are so sore,
but I'm just glad we made it.</i>

37:52.738 --> 37:55.038
<i>We're a little late,
but not too bad,</i>

37:55.040 --> 37:58.408
<i>so I don't think Dr. Now
is gonna be upset.</i>

37:58.410 --> 37:59.909
- You ready?
- Yeah.

37:59.911 --> 38:01.044
- Are you gonna do this?
- Yeah.

38:01.046 --> 38:04.014
<i>But, I'm really getting
nervous about this appointment</i>

38:04.016 --> 38:05.982
<i>because we had to rush here
so fast</i>

38:05.984 --> 38:10.754
<i>that I haven't had time to
kind of mentally prepare myself</i>

38:10.756 --> 38:13.957
<i>to talk to Dr. Now
and do this.</i>

38:15.726 --> 38:19.229
<i>I just hope that he has a plan
for me that can work,</i>

38:19.231 --> 38:22.032
<i>so I can finally lose
the weight.</i>

38:24.902 --> 38:26.670
Mr. McNeill.

38:26.672 --> 38:28.605
<i>I know that I have a lot
to lose,</i>

38:28.607 --> 38:30.840
<i>no matter what
my weight is today.</i>

38:30.842 --> 38:33.877
<i>Whatever the scale number,
it's gonna be a lot higher</i>

38:33.879 --> 38:34.644
<i>than what it should be.</i>

38:34.646 --> 38:36.413
<i>And I want to fix that.</i>

38:37.415 --> 38:40.884
<i>But, I hope the number
I get from the scale today</i>

38:40.886 --> 38:44.321
<i>is at least in the range
I was at last time.</i>

38:45.690 --> 38:49.059
<i>It's been at least five months
since I got my weight</i>

38:49.061 --> 38:50.960
<i>and I was around 750 then.</i>

38:50.962 --> 38:55.565
<i>So, if I'm around 800
or something like that now,</i>

38:55.567 --> 38:58.134
<i>it's gonna be
a huge shock for me.</i>

38:58.736 --> 39:00.737
<i>I'm worried and nervous about
that</i>

39:00.739 --> 39:02.505
<i>and I'm in a lot of pain still.</i>

39:02.507 --> 39:05.608
<i>And I feel rushed,
so I'm just hoping</i>

39:05.610 --> 39:08.712
<i>I can get through this
and it all goes right</i>

39:08.714 --> 39:11.881
<i>because in a fight
to save my life.</i>

39:11.883 --> 39:14.351
<i>And if I don't get a plan
to do that today,</i>

39:14.353 --> 39:16.386
<i>then I don't know
what I'm gonna do.</i>

39:27.698 --> 39:31.634
<i>I'm at Dr. Now's for my first
in person appointment with him</i>

39:31.636 --> 39:33.837
<i>and I'm about to get my weight.</i>

39:33.839 --> 39:36.306
[woman] Go ahead,
and step on the scale.

39:39.143 --> 39:42.645
<i>I was 744 about four months ago.</i>

39:42.647 --> 39:45.281
[breathing heavily]

39:45.283 --> 39:49.085
<i>So, I'm hoping I'm still
in the 740 range.</i>

39:54.892 --> 39:57.127
757.

39:57.895 --> 39:59.095
[JJ] It's gonna be okay, Paul.

39:59.097 --> 40:00.897
Oh, son.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.365
What are we gonna do?

40:02.833 --> 40:04.634
Gotta do something about it.

40:04.636 --> 40:05.802
[JJ] Never gonna
see that number again.

40:05.804 --> 40:08.805
- Never again.
- Never again.

40:08.807 --> 40:11.074
Whenever you mess up, just
remember seeing that number

40:11.076 --> 40:12.175
and how you feel right now.

40:12.476 --> 40:13.943
Yeah.

40:13.945 --> 40:18.114
<i>I gained a little,
but not a whole lot.</i>

40:18.849 --> 40:21.151
<i>So I'm a little relieved,</i>

40:22.386 --> 40:26.790
<i>but 750 pounds is still
a little embarrassing</i>

40:26.792 --> 40:29.926
<i>to see come up on the scale.</i>

40:29.928 --> 40:33.363
<i>And when it did,
it made me sick to my stomach.</i>

40:33.764 --> 40:36.966
<i>So, I'm here to change.</i>

40:36.968 --> 40:41.204
<i>I just hope that Dr. Now
is able to give me an option</i>

40:41.839 --> 40:43.973
<i>and a plan to help me do that.</i>

40:43.975 --> 40:45.408
[knocking at door]

40:46.710 --> 40:47.944
Hello.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.245
- Hey, Doc.
- How you all doing?

40:49.247 --> 40:50.680
[Paul] How you doing.

40:50.682 --> 40:53.983
All right, Paul, you finally
made it just a little late,

40:53.985 --> 40:56.920
but you're here,
so I'm glad to see you.

40:56.922 --> 40:58.588
So, how was your trip down here?

40:58.590 --> 40:59.622
Long.

40:59.624 --> 41:01.825
All right, how long it
take you to get down here?

41:01.827 --> 41:04.194
Almost three days.

41:04.196 --> 41:07.230
Three days.
Are you holding up okay?

41:07.232 --> 41:08.832
My body hurts.

41:08.899 --> 41:09.866
I'm tired.

41:09.868 --> 41:11.968
[Dr. Now] Tired
and your body hurts.

41:11.970 --> 41:14.404
So, that's a lot of strain
on your body

41:14.406 --> 41:15.972
going back and forth.

41:15.974 --> 41:18.641
So, this is not gonna be
something that

41:18.643 --> 41:19.876
you're gonna be able to do.

41:19.878 --> 41:22.779
And that's why it important
you move here.

41:22.781 --> 41:24.981
So, if you want to do
the program,

41:24.983 --> 41:26.850
then you need to plan to do that

41:26.852 --> 41:29.786
and stay for at least
a year or so.

41:29.788 --> 41:31.955
Because going back and forth
is going to be very hard

41:31.957 --> 41:34.657
on your body
and it not gonna be possible

41:34.659 --> 41:37.527
for us to keep the track
of your weight

41:37.529 --> 41:40.396
and make sure that
you stay committed.

41:40.398 --> 41:43.600
And if we need to intervene
to get you back on track,

41:43.602 --> 41:46.703
it won't be possible to do it
being in Florida.

41:46.705 --> 41:49.005
So, that is something
you need to consider.

41:49.007 --> 41:50.807
But, I'm glad you made it here
this time.

41:50.809 --> 41:51.975
[Paul] Thank you.

41:51.977 --> 41:54.878
So, Paul, you weren't kidding
about your weight.

41:54.880 --> 41:57.814
You're over 750
and that's a lot.

41:57.816 --> 42:00.149
But, thankfully,
you're still mobile.

42:00.151 --> 42:02.986
But, no one that weight
is getting food

42:02.988 --> 42:03.753
without some help.

42:03.755 --> 42:05.655
So, who you got with you?

42:05.657 --> 42:09.692
Um, my mother
and my best friend.

42:09.694 --> 42:11.928
- All right, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

42:11.930 --> 42:15.665
So, who is enabling you more,

42:15.667 --> 42:18.134
your mother or your friend?

42:19.703 --> 42:22.805
Probably me
'cause he's with me more.

42:22.807 --> 42:26.776
So are you the one
that encourage him to eat

42:26.778 --> 42:29.178
whatever he wants,
whenever he wants?

42:31.649 --> 42:34.717
I allow it,
and I give it to him.

42:34.719 --> 42:39.055
And I cook so I said it before
and I'm very, very sorry

42:39.057 --> 42:41.591
because I was a big woman myself

42:41.593 --> 42:42.926
and I ate wrong.

42:42.928 --> 42:46.629
And then you know
just tragedy, things happened.

42:46.631 --> 42:49.866
And Paul would
get bigger and bigger.

42:49.868 --> 42:53.970
And then when he'd say he wants
something to eat, I'd fix it for him.

42:54.838 --> 42:56.272
So how did you lose your weight?

42:56.807 --> 42:58.808
Actually I had...

42:58.810 --> 43:02.011
It started out...
I had a gallbladder problem

43:02.013 --> 43:05.648
and so I took my gallbladder
out and then I just decided

43:05.650 --> 43:08.518
to take a change on my way

43:08.520 --> 43:12.989
and I tried to go on
just like chicken,

43:12.991 --> 43:17.327
very little starches and,
you know, lots of vegetables,

43:17.329 --> 43:19.162
and no sweets.

43:19.164 --> 43:23.032
Well you're doing that for yourself
but you're not doing that for Paul.

43:23.200 --> 43:25.268
Paul, Paul I...

43:26.570 --> 43:27.870
[sighing]

43:27.872 --> 43:31.874
He was on the road a lot,
so he wasn't always home.

43:31.876 --> 43:35.778
Then when he was home,
I tried to make him happy

43:35.780 --> 43:37.513
and fix what he wanted to eat.

43:37.515 --> 43:39.282
- Well...
- I didn't see it before--

43:39.284 --> 43:42.318
Looking at his leg
and you think he's happy now?

43:42.486 --> 43:43.586
No, sir.

43:43.588 --> 43:47.056
So this is a dynamic
that we need to change.

43:47.058 --> 43:50.059
But I don't know
how we gonna change that.

43:50.861 --> 43:51.761
I know how we're
gonna change it.

43:51.763 --> 43:53.029
We're gonna try.

43:53.031 --> 43:54.897
We're gonna try
and I'm gonna cook right.

43:54.899 --> 43:58.935
And he has a young lady
that he sees.

43:58.937 --> 44:00.770
And she has already told him

44:00.772 --> 44:02.705
that food will be
cooked good, too.

44:02.707 --> 44:05.942
So we're not gonna do things
in front of him

44:05.944 --> 44:08.645
and we're gonna try
to all start eating healthy.

44:08.647 --> 44:09.979
Yeah.

44:09.981 --> 44:11.781
So Paul you come down
to Houston,

44:11.783 --> 44:13.182
who's gonna be with you?

44:15.452 --> 44:18.154
I mean I wanted
my girlfriend to come

44:18.156 --> 44:23.826
but I don't think she's able
to make it. So I'm not sure yet.

44:23.828 --> 44:26.195
You're gonna need
somebody to help you out

44:26.197 --> 44:28.665
because you know
you're not a person

44:28.667 --> 44:30.133
that you're gonna
take care of yourself.

44:30.135 --> 44:32.935
And it's not safe
for you to be alone

44:32.937 --> 44:34.937
because if anything
happen to you, if you fall,

44:34.939 --> 44:37.073
who's gonna help you.

44:37.075 --> 44:39.976
And somebody need to be
around with you

44:39.978 --> 44:42.345
so it'll be safe, okay?

44:42.913 --> 44:46.182
So if you want to do the program

44:46.184 --> 44:47.417
you're gonna have to
figure that out.

44:47.419 --> 44:48.584
Yes, sir.

44:48.586 --> 44:52.422
So just think about that and
let me know what you decide.

44:52.424 --> 44:57.093
But for the time being, your
mother is gonna stop enabling you.

44:57.861 --> 44:59.062
Yes.

44:59.897 --> 45:02.365
Is that what your mom said?

45:03.200 --> 45:04.400
That's what I say.

45:04.402 --> 45:07.236
And your friend is
not enabling you, huh?

45:08.605 --> 45:09.739
I do sometimes.

45:09.741 --> 45:11.841
I'm a little more stern with him

45:11.843 --> 45:13.876
because I also had the surgery
five years ago.

45:13.878 --> 45:17.113
So I know the struggles but...

45:17.948 --> 45:20.516
So everybody look like
they know what to do.

45:20.518 --> 45:22.585
- Right.
- But not for Paul.

45:22.587 --> 45:27.390
So let's keep Paul happy and
give him more... whatever he want.

45:27.392 --> 45:29.525
Instead of making
him permanently happy

45:29.527 --> 45:32.695
we try to make him happy
in that moment. But, yeah.

45:32.697 --> 45:35.998
We know it's not good
and we have to change.

45:36.000 --> 45:39.102
So this is all more reason
you need to be here

45:39.104 --> 45:43.973
so we can get you to be accountable
for your eating habit, okay?

45:44.174 --> 45:45.007
Yes, sir.

45:45.009 --> 45:46.943
But until then,
you need to realize that

45:46.945 --> 45:49.679
enabling people
are gonna be around you,

45:49.681 --> 45:52.381
but ultimately it is
your responsibility

45:52.383 --> 45:53.449
to change your eating habit.

45:53.451 --> 45:55.051
- Yes, sir.
- And that's gonna be something

45:55.053 --> 45:57.754
that you're gonna have to do.
You understand that right?

45:57.756 --> 45:59.388
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

45:59.390 --> 46:03.426
All right Paul, so right now,
because you live so far

46:03.428 --> 46:06.429
I'm gonna set your next appointment
for three months from now.

46:06.431 --> 46:10.099
I don't want you traveling
again too soon after this trip.

46:10.101 --> 46:15.905
In that time you need to lose
100 pounds in three months.

46:15.907 --> 46:16.973
You think you can do that?

46:16.975 --> 46:18.307
Yes, sir.

46:18.309 --> 46:22.912
So you should be
around 650 by then, okay?

46:22.914 --> 46:25.815
And if you do that I'll approve
you for weight loss surgery

46:25.817 --> 46:27.049
to help you lose weight.

46:27.051 --> 46:29.952
And also what's going on
with your legs

46:29.954 --> 46:31.754
and all the swelling you got?

46:31.756 --> 46:33.189
[Paul] Lymphedema.

46:34.892 --> 46:37.760
You got it also down in the leg.

46:37.762 --> 46:39.996
All the way down to my feet.

46:39.998 --> 46:42.198
- Okay.
- All through the back of my legs, yeah.

46:43.066 --> 46:45.601
Hasn't really opened right now

46:45.603 --> 46:47.170
but sometimes they do open.

46:48.005 --> 46:51.541
Okay. So what you doing
with the lymphedema?

46:51.543 --> 46:53.810
I try to put socks on.

46:53.812 --> 46:57.914
I have some compression socks
but sometimes it's hard to do.

46:57.916 --> 47:02.185
Okay. So how mobile are you?
How much you can walk?

47:02.753 --> 47:06.088
I can stand for probably
about ten minutes.

47:06.090 --> 47:10.560
I can walk to the end of
my mom's driveway, you know.

47:10.562 --> 47:12.728
- You get short of breath?
- Yes sir,

47:12.730 --> 47:14.297
So we have a lot
of work to do with you

47:14.299 --> 47:15.798
to get you healthy, Paul.

47:15.800 --> 47:18.201
But nothing we do
is gonna matter

47:18.203 --> 47:20.570
if you don't make the choices
to work hard.

47:20.572 --> 47:22.905
- You get that?
- Yes sir.

47:22.907 --> 47:25.474
Everyone come here
to lose weight.

47:25.476 --> 47:27.643
The only way you're gonna be
able to do that

47:27.645 --> 47:30.413
is that you're gonna
have to do the hard work,

47:30.415 --> 47:33.583
and you're gonna make
those changes happen. Okay?

47:33.585 --> 47:37.820
So you're gonna have to prove
that you can change your eating habit

47:37.822 --> 47:41.557
and motivate yourself so
that's gonna be all up to you

47:41.559 --> 47:44.493
- to do the hard work, okay?
- Okay.

47:44.495 --> 47:48.097
So I sent you the diet and
exercises a couple of weeks ago.

47:48.099 --> 47:51.267
Have you started following it
and doing what it says?

47:51.735 --> 47:52.568
[Paul] Not yet.

47:52.570 --> 47:55.238
So how does that make sense

47:55.240 --> 47:58.708
if you're telling me
that you're ready to change?

47:58.710 --> 48:01.777
I'm ready now.
And I'm gonna do what I need.

48:01.779 --> 48:05.781
Okay. In order to get the
temptation out of the house,

48:05.783 --> 48:10.386
get all the unhealthy food
out of the house.

48:10.388 --> 48:12.688
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

48:12.690 --> 48:14.490
Then Paul, follow the diet.

48:14.492 --> 48:15.958
You only eat three time a day.

48:15.960 --> 48:18.794
Make sure it's high protein,
low carb diet.

48:18.796 --> 48:21.530
So I know I gave you
some instruction,

48:21.532 --> 48:23.399
but I'm gonna bring you it again

48:23.401 --> 48:26.002
and maybe I'll give
another copy to your mom

48:26.004 --> 48:28.704
so she can be more familiar

48:28.706 --> 48:31.407
what you're gonna be
doing that. Okay?

48:31.409 --> 48:34.410
Also do your exercises,
and if you do all that

48:34.412 --> 48:37.747
you should easily be able to
lose 100 pound in three months.

48:37.749 --> 48:42.151
- Okay.
- When you're 700 pounds you can lose 100 pounds easily.

48:42.153 --> 48:45.521
So you got a lot of room
to lose that very quickly.

48:45.523 --> 48:47.089
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

48:48.292 --> 48:50.826
- All right, any questions?
- [Paul] No sir.

48:50.828 --> 48:53.930
Okay. I'm gonna bring you
another copy of the diet

48:53.932 --> 48:56.732
and exercises
that I want you to do

48:56.734 --> 48:58.801
and I want you to go over it.
I'll be back.

48:58.803 --> 48:59.535
[Paul] All right. Thank you.

48:59.537 --> 49:01.070
[Teresa] Thank you, sir.

49:06.510 --> 49:10.413
I'm glad to see that everyone
seems ready to support Paul.

49:10.415 --> 49:13.082
<i>And do what it takes
to help him get healthy.</i>

49:13.084 --> 49:15.651
<i>And that Paul feels he's ready
to make the changes</i>

49:15.653 --> 49:17.453
he need to save his life.

49:17.455 --> 49:21.190
<i>But as ready as
they all are to do this,</i>

49:21.192 --> 49:23.693
<i>it's not gonna be simple
for Paul and his mom</i>

49:23.695 --> 49:25.561
<i>to change
their dynamic instantly.</i>

49:25.563 --> 49:27.930
<i>But it is Paul's responsibility</i>

49:27.932 --> 49:31.734
to make sure that no matter
the situation or temptation,

49:31.736 --> 49:36.405
the choice to do
what he need is up to him.

49:36.407 --> 49:39.875
[Dr. Now] No more nothing to
do and watching for the food.

49:39.877 --> 49:43.779
You get all this homework,
you start working on it, okay?

49:43.781 --> 49:45.848
- Yes, sir.
- And,

49:45.850 --> 49:47.750
let me know if you need anything

49:47.752 --> 49:49.919
and then we go from there, okay?

49:49.921 --> 49:52.154
Sounds good, thank you.

49:52.156 --> 49:55.024
Before you go
we do some tests, okay?

49:55.026 --> 49:55.725
Thank you.

49:55.727 --> 49:57.126
All right.

49:57.128 --> 49:59.695
- And if you need anything give me a call.
- Yes, sir.

49:59.697 --> 50:00.830
Thank you very much.

50:00.832 --> 50:02.832
All right you're welcome.
I'll see you all later.

50:02.834 --> 50:03.866
- See you later.
- All right. Bye-bye.

50:11.708 --> 50:14.610
<i>So far it is concerning
that he has a few weeks</i>

50:14.612 --> 50:16.846
<i>to start making those changes</i>

50:16.848 --> 50:18.681
with the diet and exercises
I sent him.

50:18.683 --> 50:20.016
<i>But hasn't.</i>

50:20.018 --> 50:23.619
<i>So it's time for him to
put action to all he's saying</i>

50:23.621 --> 50:25.755
<i>and show me he can do this.</i>

50:25.757 --> 50:29.959
Because if he doesn't, we
won't be moving ahead with him.

50:30.894 --> 50:34.997
<i>[Paul] I know I have to do this.</i>

50:34.999 --> 50:39.101
<i>I'm out of options so I have to
lose 100 pounds in three months.</i>

50:39.770 --> 50:43.873
<i>And do everything
Dr. Now says starting now.</i>

50:43.875 --> 50:48.344
<i>I know 100 pounds
is a whole lot to lose</i>

50:49.379 --> 50:51.647
<i>but I'm actually excited
about the goal.</i>

50:51.649 --> 50:55.785
<i>Because I feel like
I have a plan to fix things.</i>

50:55.787 --> 50:58.654
<i>And there's still time
for me to turn it all around</i>

50:58.656 --> 51:00.122
<i>before it's too late.</i>

51:00.524 --> 51:02.658
<i>I'm making it to that goal</i>

51:02.660 --> 51:05.461
<i>because I'm getting
a second chance in life</i>

51:05.463 --> 51:09.031
<i>and I'm gonna do whatever it
takes to get approved for surgery.</i>

51:21.978 --> 51:25.381
<i>[Paul] I've been back home
from Houston for a few days now.</i>

51:26.349 --> 51:30.152
<i>And as soon as we made it home
my focus went 100 percent</i>

51:30.154 --> 51:34.857
<i>towards making the changes
I need to do Dr. Now's diet.</i>

51:34.859 --> 51:37.993
<i>Because I'm determined
to get to my goal.</i>

51:40.430 --> 51:42.765
<i>But we don't have
the ingredients I need at home</i>

51:42.767 --> 51:45.734
<i>to make the healthy stuff
in this diet.</i>

51:45.736 --> 51:49.004
<i>So I'm trying to make sure
I have what I need now.</i>

51:49.006 --> 51:50.906
- Yeah, Dad?
- Turkeys.

51:50.908 --> 51:52.741
Turkey gizzards,
stuff like that?

51:52.743 --> 51:54.810
It has to be high protein.

51:54.812 --> 51:57.379
-Turkey's high protein. All protein.
-No.

51:57.381 --> 51:58.814
Yeah it is.

51:58.816 --> 52:01.417
<i>I'm looking forward to the day
where I can go somewhere</i>

52:01.419 --> 52:05.287
<i>and walk around enough
without having to have a scooter.</i>

52:05.289 --> 52:09.391
<i>Right now, this is the only
option I have to go anywhere</i>

52:09.393 --> 52:13.229
<i>where I have to walk a lot
or be on my feet for a while.</i>

52:18.735 --> 52:20.870
[Thomas] You can have that
without, without the butter--

52:20.872 --> 52:22.004
That's too many carbs.

52:22.006 --> 52:23.005
They're small though.

52:23.007 --> 52:24.140
Still dad.

52:24.808 --> 52:25.908
I think I'm gonna get this.

52:25.910 --> 52:28.544
<i>[Paul] This is gonna be
a little tougher to do</i>

52:28.546 --> 52:31.947
<i>than I thought
just because I have to learn</i>

52:31.949 --> 52:35.117
<i>what options that I can get
that work and what don't.</i>

52:35.119 --> 52:36.485
Bananas.

52:36.487 --> 52:38.487
No I can't.
I can't have no fruit.

52:38.489 --> 52:40.389
I'm not supposed to have it
because I'm a diabetic.

52:40.391 --> 52:43.893
- I didn't know you couldn't 'cause you're fat.
- Yeah.

52:43.895 --> 52:47.396
<i>[Paul] There's a lot of good
ingredients Dr. Now listed in his diet</i>

52:47.398 --> 52:51.000
<i>that I'm allowed to use
to make my healthy meals.</i>

52:51.002 --> 52:54.436
<i>I didn't realize how many
things have a lot of stuff</i>

52:54.438 --> 52:56.405
<i>that you're not
supposed to have.</i>

52:56.407 --> 53:00.276
<i>But I know that's the stuff
that makes it taste so good.</i>

53:02.479 --> 53:05.114
<i>So I'm not getting as much
as I was thinking,</i>

53:05.116 --> 53:08.584
<i>but at least I feel like I got
a good starting point</i>

53:08.586 --> 53:09.752
<i>to begin doing the diet.</i>

53:09.754 --> 53:12.588
<i>But I know this is mostly
gonna come down</i>

53:12.590 --> 53:16.659
<i>to having to make meals myself
or with my mom's help.</i>

53:16.661 --> 53:20.062
<i>And that's not gonna be
easy to do three times a day.</i>

53:20.064 --> 53:22.731
<i>But I'm committed
to doing this because I know</i>

53:22.733 --> 53:26.769
<i>everything depends on me
losing weight and qualifying.</i>

53:26.771 --> 53:30.406
<i>So no matter what it takes,
I'm gonna figure this out.</i>

53:43.386 --> 53:45.521
<i>For the past month,
I've continued making</i>

53:45.523 --> 53:48.157
<i>a lot of adjustments
to what I'm doing.</i>

53:49.359 --> 53:52.428
<i>After I went shopping
for some better ingredients,</i>

53:52.430 --> 53:54.697
<i>my mom did what Dr. Now said</i>

53:54.699 --> 53:57.600
<i>and threw out
all the bad stuff in my house</i>

53:57.602 --> 53:59.868
<i>so it wouldn't be there
to tempt me.</i>

53:59.870 --> 54:01.937
<i>And it was hard
to watch all that stuff go,</i>

54:01.939 --> 54:03.772
<i>but I knew it had to be done,</i>

54:03.774 --> 54:05.808
<i>because I couldn't be around it.</i>

54:05.810 --> 54:08.310
<i>A part of what me
and my mom decided to do</i>

54:08.312 --> 54:11.580
<i>was to have me start cooking
most of my meals</i>

54:11.582 --> 54:16.452
<i>because her temptation is making
the food taste as good as she can.</i>

54:16.454 --> 54:19.822
<i>That's how she showed people
her love for so long.</i>

54:19.824 --> 54:25.761
<i>So she just instinctly puts
butter and all this other stuff.</i>

54:25.763 --> 54:27.896
<i>So for right now, I'm trying
to do my own cooking</i>

54:27.898 --> 54:29.698
<i>for most of my meals.</i>

54:29.700 --> 54:31.700
<i>And I learned to make
some simple meals</i>

54:31.702 --> 54:34.970
<i>so I don't have to head
back to the store as often.</i>

54:35.572 --> 54:37.906
<i>The first stuff I got
from the grocery store</i>

54:37.908 --> 54:41.577
<i>ran out in less than a week,
and I had to go back again.</i>

54:41.579 --> 54:44.680
<i>So I tried just
to do simpler meals</i>

54:44.682 --> 54:46.782
<i>so I can stretch out
what I have for longer</i>

54:46.784 --> 54:48.484
<i>so that doesn't happen again.</i>

54:48.486 --> 54:50.853
<i>And it's working some.</i>

54:50.855 --> 54:53.756
<i>I don't run out as fast but it's
only like an extra three or four days.</i>

54:53.758 --> 54:59.061
<i>So my mom's trying to help me by
grabbing what I need when she can.</i>

54:59.063 --> 55:02.831
<i>But for the past month I've
been complying to Dr. Now's diet</i>

55:02.833 --> 55:04.900
<i>and only eating
what I'm supposed to eat.</i>

55:04.902 --> 55:08.537
<i>And I'm making meals with
the only approved ingredients.</i>

55:08.539 --> 55:10.105
<i>So I feel good about that.</i>

55:11.341 --> 55:13.676
<i>But it's been
a lonely experience,</i>

55:13.678 --> 55:15.911
<i>because I'm having
to eat alone a lot</i>

55:15.913 --> 55:18.380
<i>since I'm avoiding temptation.</i>

55:19.649 --> 55:22.518
<i>When my mom,
Jen or JJ eat with me,</i>

55:22.520 --> 55:25.354
<i>they don't get anything bad
to support me,</i>

55:25.356 --> 55:27.723
<i>but it's hard for them
to do it every meal.</i>

55:27.725 --> 55:31.093
<i>So I try to eat breakfast
and lunch on my own right now,</i>

55:31.095 --> 55:34.763
<i>so I can make what I need
and not be around anything else</i>

55:34.765 --> 55:36.832
<i>that can tempt me.</i>

55:36.834 --> 55:39.401
<i>I'm scared I'm gonna
give in if I do.</i>

55:39.403 --> 55:42.404
<i>So I just make my meals
and eat them.</i>

55:42.406 --> 55:45.574
<i>And then I try to occupy
myself throughout the day</i>

55:45.576 --> 55:49.645
<i>so I don't think about food
and all the stuff I wish I can eat.</i>

55:49.647 --> 55:51.814
<i>And I'm making sure not to snack</i>

55:51.816 --> 55:57.019
<i>because Dr. Now made it clear,
absolutely no snacking.</i>

56:03.827 --> 56:07.096
<i>And I'm also doing
my exercises every day.</i>

56:08.698 --> 56:11.567
<i>Those were hard to start
because walking's still tough for me.</i>

56:11.569 --> 56:15.237
<i>And the upper body exercises
were a little tough to start at first.</i>

56:16.106 --> 56:17.873
<i>But I'm able to do
all the stretches</i>

56:17.875 --> 56:20.209
<i>and mom exercises now.</i>

56:21.478 --> 56:23.946
<i>After doing 'em for a while
it's not too bad.</i>

56:23.948 --> 56:28.083
<i>But I'm still trying to work
on my ability to walk.</i>

56:31.554 --> 56:34.356
<i>Right now, I can't go very far.</i>

56:35.892 --> 56:40.329
<i>My limit when I started was
the end of my mom's driveway.</i>

56:41.064 --> 56:42.498
<i>I knew I could walk that far</i>

56:42.500 --> 56:44.867
<i>because I've had to walk it
to get to the car</i>

56:44.869 --> 56:46.702
<i>that was parked
at the end of the driveway.</i>

56:46.704 --> 56:49.238
<i>I can't go
much further than that.</i>

56:50.607 --> 56:54.610
<i>So I walk to the edge of the
driveway and take a small break.</i>

56:54.612 --> 56:56.979
<i>And enjoy the view for a moment.</i>

56:58.548 --> 57:00.816
<i>That makes me think
about the whole world</i>

57:00.818 --> 57:03.419
<i>that's out there,
that's out of reach for me.</i>

57:03.421 --> 57:06.922
<i>And I can't enjoy
or be a part of.</i>

57:06.924 --> 57:11.627
<i>And I use that to try to
motivate myself to work hard.</i>

57:11.629 --> 57:14.229
<i>And then I head back
inside to rest</i>

57:14.231 --> 57:16.265
<i>because that tires me out.</i>

57:18.334 --> 57:22.037
<i>And I do that twice a day
like Dr. Now said.</i>

57:22.039 --> 57:24.940
<i>But I'm noticing that
when I come back in</i>

57:24.942 --> 57:26.909
<i>that I'm not as out of breath
as I was</i>

57:26.911 --> 57:30.045
<i>when I started all this
a month ago.</i>

57:30.047 --> 57:32.981
<i>That makes me feel good
because it feels like</i>

57:32.983 --> 57:35.250
<i>it's some
proof I'm making progress.</i>

57:36.753 --> 57:37.920
<i>I'm doing good.</i>

57:37.922 --> 57:40.823
<i>I have two more months
before I go back</i>

57:40.825 --> 57:44.193
<i>to see Dr. Now and to find
how I did.</i>

57:44.694 --> 57:46.995
<i>But I'm determined
to get to my goal</i>

57:46.997 --> 57:49.498
<i>to make sure I get approved
for his program</i>

57:49.500 --> 57:51.099
<i>and weight loss surgery.</i>

57:51.101 --> 57:53.735
<i>And once that happens,
the next step is for me</i>

57:53.737 --> 57:55.304
<i>to move there to Houston.</i>

57:55.839 --> 57:58.640
<i>And that's gonna be
hard and scary</i>

57:58.642 --> 57:59.774
<i>because I don't want
to leave Jen</i>

57:59.776 --> 58:02.945
<i>and I still don't know
who's gonna move with me.</i>

58:02.947 --> 58:05.647
<i>But I know I'm gonna figure
it out because I'm ready to do</i>

58:05.649 --> 58:10.052
<i>whatever I have to and have a
chance at the future I want with Jen.</i>

58:10.054 --> 58:12.588
<i>So until then,
I'm gonna push myself</i>

58:12.590 --> 58:14.590
<i>to work as hard as I can.</i>

58:14.592 --> 58:17.559
<i>And hopefully
when I go back to see Dr. Now,</i>

58:17.561 --> 58:19.761
<i>it'll be enough
for me to qualify</i>

58:19.763 --> 58:22.431
<i>and take the step I need
to get my life back.</i>

58:39.682 --> 58:42.518
<i>I'm back at Dr. Now's
for my second appointment</i>

58:42.520 --> 58:45.721
<i>to find out if I made it
to my goal or not.</i>

58:45.723 --> 58:47.723
<i>And I'm a little nervous
to find out.</i>

58:47.725 --> 58:50.058
<i>But overall, I'm doing okay.</i>

58:50.060 --> 58:52.861
<i>I'm just a little sore
from the trip here,</i>

58:52.863 --> 58:55.631
<i>but it's not nearly
as bad as the last time</i>

58:55.633 --> 58:57.733
<i>because this time I flew,</i>

58:57.735 --> 59:00.235
<i>and that was
an experience for me.</i>

59:04.707 --> 59:07.142
<i>Hopefully, this appointment
is a good one</i>

59:07.144 --> 59:10.112
<i>and I feel like there's
a good chance it will be.</i>

59:15.084 --> 59:17.386
Mr. MacNeill.

59:17.388 --> 59:21.323
<i>The last time I was here
I weighed in at 757.</i>

59:21.325 --> 59:23.158
<i>That was three months ago,</i>

59:23.160 --> 59:27.462
<i>and Dr. Now gave me a goal
to lose 100 pounds by today.</i>

59:27.464 --> 59:31.400
<i>So that means my weight
has to be down to 657</i>

59:31.402 --> 59:35.737
<i>if I made it to my goal to
qualify for Dr. Now's program</i>

59:35.739 --> 59:38.440
<i>so that's what I'm really hoping
to see on the scale right now.</i>

59:43.846 --> 59:46.081
[nurse] Your weight is 695.

59:48.384 --> 59:52.054
<i>I got mixed feelings
seeing that weight I guess</i>

59:52.056 --> 59:56.391
<i>because I'm disappointed
I didn't lose what I needed.</i>

59:56.693 --> 59:58.927
<i>But I did still lose a lot</i>

59:58.929 --> 1:00:02.230
<i>and it's hard not to feel
a little proud of that.</i>

1:00:04.033 --> 1:00:06.401
<i>But ultimately,
I'm nervous right now</i>

1:00:06.403 --> 1:00:09.137
<i>because I don't know
what Dr. Now's gonna say.</i>

1:00:09.139 --> 1:00:10.839
<i>I just hope it's positive.</i>

1:00:10.841 --> 1:00:12.074
[knock at door]

1:00:13.943 --> 1:00:15.444
Hello. How you doing, Paul?

1:00:15.945 --> 1:00:17.312
I'm good, Dr. Now.

1:00:17.947 --> 1:00:19.581
Where is your family?

1:00:19.583 --> 1:00:20.949
Uh, at home.

1:00:20.951 --> 1:00:23.752
So you left your enablers
all at home?

1:00:23.754 --> 1:00:25.687
- [laughs] Yeah.
- Except yourself?

1:00:25.689 --> 1:00:28.924
Except myself.
I'm my own enabler.

1:00:28.926 --> 1:00:30.726
All right. How was your trip?

1:00:30.728 --> 1:00:33.895
It was a little cramped,
but it was an easier trip.

1:00:33.897 --> 1:00:37.633
It's a whole lot easier than being
on the road two to three days.

1:00:37.635 --> 1:00:38.867
Definitely, sir.

1:00:38.869 --> 1:00:41.203
But still it's a lot of strain
on your system

1:00:41.205 --> 1:00:42.738
going back and forth like that.

1:00:42.740 --> 1:00:44.673
So if you want to do the program

1:00:44.675 --> 1:00:46.642
you need to move
down to Houston.

1:00:46.644 --> 1:00:49.745
I'm gonna do that as soon as I
get approved for weight loss surgery.

1:00:49.747 --> 1:00:51.647
So if you tell me today
that I'm getting it,

1:00:51.649 --> 1:00:53.482
I'll move down here
as soon as possible.

1:00:53.484 --> 1:00:57.853
Well you lost 62 pounds
in the last three months

1:00:57.855 --> 1:01:01.690
so that's positive, but still it's a
lot less than you should have lost.

1:01:01.692 --> 1:01:02.891
I know.

1:01:02.893 --> 1:01:06.395
So right now instead of losing
at least 33 pounds a month,

1:01:06.397 --> 1:01:07.896
you only lost 20.

1:01:07.898 --> 1:01:10.499
So that means that
you're not doing the diet

1:01:10.501 --> 1:01:12.701
like you should
because if you were

1:01:12.703 --> 1:01:14.970
you would have easily lost
what you should have.

1:01:14.972 --> 1:01:16.938
What did you do
with your eating habit

1:01:16.940 --> 1:01:19.708
to start making
the changes you need?

1:01:19.710 --> 1:01:21.910
I just been trying
to learn your diet

1:01:21.912 --> 1:01:23.779
and cut back
to only what's on it.

1:01:23.781 --> 1:01:27.015
So I cut out bread and pastas
and all the junk food.

1:01:27.017 --> 1:01:28.984
No sugars and sodas.

1:01:28.986 --> 1:01:30.752
I feel like I made a big change.

1:01:30.754 --> 1:01:32.154
But I guess it wasn't enough.

1:01:32.156 --> 1:01:34.556
Are you still
emotional eating at all?

1:01:34.558 --> 1:01:35.924
I don't think I am.

1:01:35.926 --> 1:01:38.827
So you're working on things
with Dr. Paradise?

1:01:38.829 --> 1:01:40.562
Yes, I am, sir.

1:01:40.564 --> 1:01:43.799
Okay. Keep that up,
but how's your portion size?

1:01:43.801 --> 1:01:47.469
A lot smaller than what
I usually eat, a whole lot.

1:01:47.471 --> 1:01:50.839
- Do you eat 'til you're full?
- Sometimes.

1:01:50.841 --> 1:01:53.575
With a stomach your size
you shouldn't eat to get full.

1:01:53.577 --> 1:01:56.578
You have a stomach about
the size of two footballs.

1:01:56.580 --> 1:01:59.014
So you need surgery to fix that

1:01:59.016 --> 1:02:00.515
so you can get full
much quicker.

1:02:00.517 --> 1:02:03.485
So you need to cut back
on your portion size.

1:02:03.487 --> 1:02:05.520
I'll do that 'cause
I didn't realize that.

1:02:05.522 --> 1:02:09.424
Now if you look at my book
I explain the portion size.

1:02:09.426 --> 1:02:13.829
So if you eat meat it should
be around four to six ounces.

1:02:13.831 --> 1:02:18.967
So four to six ounces
is what fit in my hand, okay?

1:02:18.969 --> 1:02:22.537
But then, when you're eating
a salad or cooked vegetable,

1:02:22.539 --> 1:02:27.142
put that on a smaller plate so you'll
have control of your portion size.

1:02:27.144 --> 1:02:30.479
So before you eat, you
put everything on the plate,

1:02:30.481 --> 1:02:32.981
so you see
what the portion size are.

1:02:32.983 --> 1:02:35.951
- So you can control that, okay?
- Yes, sir.

1:02:35.953 --> 1:02:38.787
So if you do that then over time

1:02:38.789 --> 1:02:41.623
you get full
as your stomach shrinks.

1:02:41.625 --> 1:02:44.126
I will do that,
and I didn't realize that,

1:02:44.128 --> 1:02:48.163
but I'm dedicated to do this.
I promise you Dr. Now.

1:02:48.165 --> 1:02:48.897
[Dr. Now] Okay, great.

1:02:48.899 --> 1:02:50.532
So here's what we can do.

1:02:50.534 --> 1:02:52.400
Since you showed me
some good progress,

1:02:52.402 --> 1:02:56.371
I'm gonna reduce your goal
to 50 pounds over two months.

1:02:56.373 --> 1:02:59.775
And if you do that then I'm gonna
approve you for weight loss surgery.

1:02:59.777 --> 1:03:01.409
You think you can do that?

1:03:01.411 --> 1:03:02.844
I'll definitely do that, sir.

1:03:02.846 --> 1:03:06.815
Good. But remember, you
have to move down here first

1:03:06.817 --> 1:03:08.683
before we go ahead
and do surgery.

1:03:08.685 --> 1:03:10.519
That's no problem, sir.

1:03:10.521 --> 1:03:12.821
If I'm getting weight loss
surgery, I'll move down here

1:03:12.823 --> 1:03:15.390
and stay as long as I
need to do your program.

1:03:15.392 --> 1:03:18.593
Great. So lose
another 50 pounds

1:03:18.595 --> 1:03:20.929
by cutting back
on your portion sizes.

1:03:20.931 --> 1:03:22.864
And once you do that, move here,

1:03:22.866 --> 1:03:25.033
then we'll schedule
your surgery.

1:03:25.035 --> 1:03:26.434
You got it, Dr. Now.
Thank you.

1:03:26.436 --> 1:03:29.704
You're welcome. Okay,
I'll see you in two months.

1:03:29.706 --> 1:03:34.042
Have a safe trip back and if you need
anything before then give me a call.

1:03:34.044 --> 1:03:36.044
I will, thank you, Dr. Now.

1:03:36.046 --> 1:03:37.913
Okay. Take care.

1:03:37.915 --> 1:03:38.947
- You too.
- Bye now.

1:03:38.981 --> 1:03:40.448
Bye.

1:03:43.686 --> 1:03:46.454
<i>[Dr. Now] I am very encouraged
to see the progress Paul's made</i>

1:03:46.456 --> 1:03:47.656
<i>over the last three months.</i>

1:03:47.658 --> 1:03:50.926
Even though it's not as much
as he should have made,

1:03:50.928 --> 1:03:55.497
<i>it shows me he's trying to make
the changes he needs to do this.</i>

1:03:55.499 --> 1:03:57.799
But it sounds like
the portion sizes

1:03:57.801 --> 1:04:01.903
are the issue that he
need to focus on still.

1:04:01.905 --> 1:04:04.706
<i>And there may be some
emotional component to that</i>

1:04:04.708 --> 1:04:06.675
<i>to where he eats to get full,</i>

1:04:06.677 --> 1:04:10.078
to get the satisfied feeling
he wants from food still

1:04:10.080 --> 1:04:11.479
even though he has cut back.

1:04:11.481 --> 1:04:15.717
<i>So if he works on that
and loses another 50 pounds</i>

1:04:15.719 --> 1:04:18.420
<i>to show me he's getting some
control over his eating habits</i>

1:04:18.422 --> 1:04:20.822
in all the ways he needs.

1:04:20.824 --> 1:04:25.427
<i>And I feel confident he's ready to
move ahead and get weight loss surgery.</i>

1:04:25.429 --> 1:04:27.963
As soon as he moves to Houston.

1:04:28.798 --> 1:04:33.735
<i>I feel like Dr. Now was
fair with me so I feel good.</i>

1:04:33.737 --> 1:04:37.239
<i>You know I lost,
but it was the goal I needed.</i>

1:04:37.241 --> 1:04:39.708
<i>So I didn't qualify this time.</i>

1:04:39.710 --> 1:04:42.878
<i>But even though I didn't get
approved for weight loss surgery</i>

1:04:42.880 --> 1:04:45.480
<i>I have an easier goal
for next time.</i>

1:04:45.482 --> 1:04:47.515
<i>And I know I'm gonna be
able to do it</i>

1:04:47.517 --> 1:04:51.753
<i>with what I've done so far
and everything I've learned.</i>

1:04:51.755 --> 1:04:55.156
<i>So I'll go back focused and
cutting my portion sizes down</i>

1:04:55.158 --> 1:04:56.725
<i>like Dr. Now said,</i>

1:04:56.727 --> 1:05:01.630
<i>and see if I can lose even
more each month by doing that.</i>

1:05:01.632 --> 1:05:04.633
<i>Because I want to do
everything I can</i>

1:05:04.635 --> 1:05:09.571
<i>to make sure my next appointment
is the one I get my approval at.</i>

1:05:09.573 --> 1:05:12.774
<i>I'm done wasting time
and wasting my life.</i>

1:05:12.776 --> 1:05:15.710
<i>So every choice I make
from here on out</i>

1:05:15.712 --> 1:05:16.645
<i>it's gonna be one that moves me</i>

1:05:16.647 --> 1:05:18.980
<i>towards getting my life back</i>

1:05:18.982 --> 1:05:24.019
<i>because I'm taking back control
of my life no matter what it takes.</i>

1:05:32.962 --> 1:05:36.798
<i>Today I'm at the carnival
I used to work at</i>

1:05:36.800 --> 1:05:38.233
<i>to start working there again.</i>

1:05:38.968 --> 1:05:40.201
Hey, Butch.

1:05:40.803 --> 1:05:42.504
- Whoa!
- What's up, man?

1:05:42.506 --> 1:05:43.771
- What's up, man?
- All right.

1:05:46.042 --> 1:05:48.209
- What's going on man.
- Good, how are you, how you doing?

1:05:48.211 --> 1:05:49.911
All right.
You doing All right?

1:05:49.913 --> 1:05:52.080
- I'm good.
- Look like you're losing a little weight there.

1:05:52.082 --> 1:05:54.549
- Yeah, a little bit.
- Yeah?

1:05:54.551 --> 1:05:56.217
All right, boss, let's go.

1:05:56.786 --> 1:05:58.720
<i>[Paul] I cut back
on my portions,</i>

1:05:58.722 --> 1:06:00.689
<i>and I'm eating smaller sizes.</i>

1:06:00.691 --> 1:06:03.358
<i>And I'm able to get around
even better now</i>

1:06:03.360 --> 1:06:06.394
<i>to where I can even go out
without the scooter now.</i>

1:06:08.864 --> 1:06:11.866
<i>And trying to figure out
and plan my move to Houston</i>

1:06:11.868 --> 1:06:14.202
<i>and looking at places
to live and all that.</i>

1:06:17.073 --> 1:06:18.306
<i>Where you want it at, Butch?</i>

1:06:18.874 --> 1:06:21.643
<i>I realize I need to
save up some money</i>

1:06:21.645 --> 1:06:24.112
<i>to be able to afford
to stay there for a year</i>

1:06:24.114 --> 1:06:26.214
<i>because I'm gonna be on my own.</i>

1:06:27.483 --> 1:06:29.084
Over there, Michele?

1:06:29.086 --> 1:06:33.221
<i>And I don't know what kind of job
or work I'll be able to do in Houston.</i>

1:06:33.656 --> 1:06:35.757
<i>Carnival work is what I know,</i>

1:06:35.759 --> 1:06:38.393
<i>so I called the guys
and asked them</i>

1:06:38.395 --> 1:06:39.961
<i>if I could jump back in,</i>

1:06:39.963 --> 1:06:42.097
<i>and they told me
it was gonna be no problem.</i>

1:06:44.066 --> 1:06:45.734
Hey!

1:06:45.736 --> 1:06:47.268
I'll sit on this cooler.

1:06:47.270 --> 1:06:49.838
<i>And they'd love to have me back</i>

1:06:49.840 --> 1:06:52.807
<i>so I'm excited to be doing
this, and to see everyone.</i>

1:06:52.809 --> 1:06:56.244
<i>I just hope I could do
the full day like I need.</i>

1:06:58.681 --> 1:07:02.117
<i>So far I feel like
I'm holding up pretty good.</i>

1:07:02.885 --> 1:07:05.020
<i>This has taken a lot out of me,</i>

1:07:05.421 --> 1:07:07.155
<i>but it feels good to be back.</i>

1:07:08.491 --> 1:07:11.726
<i>I really missed it
more than I realized.</i>

1:07:11.728 --> 1:07:17.098
<i>So as exhausted as I am,
I'm happy to be doing this.</i>

1:07:18.734 --> 1:07:23.371
<i>It's kinda like coming home
and I just miss being here.</i>

1:07:23.373 --> 1:07:26.307
<i>That may sound weird,
but this is where I grew up.</i>

1:07:27.309 --> 1:07:30.812
<i>And this is where I worked
for my whole adult life.</i>

1:07:30.814 --> 1:07:35.717
<i>Right now I'm gonna work off
days so it's not that crowded.</i>

1:07:35.719 --> 1:07:38.987
<i>Just because I'm still nervous
being around a lot of people.</i>

1:07:38.989 --> 1:07:41.523
<i>One thing
that I didn't think about</i>

1:07:41.525 --> 1:07:45.660
<i>is being around all the
food I love, carnival food</i>

1:07:45.662 --> 1:07:50.098
<i>because it's all the stuff
I used to eat constantly,</i>

1:07:50.100 --> 1:07:53.201
<i>every day of my life
for so many years.</i>

1:07:53.803 --> 1:07:56.004
<i>But I'm not gonna give in.</i>

1:07:57.273 --> 1:08:00.008
<i>I'm gonna stay focused
on the work.</i>

1:08:01.410 --> 1:08:05.513
<i>Once I lose the weight then I
can do the things I want with Jen.</i>

1:08:05.515 --> 1:08:07.649
<i>I'm hoping we can get married</i>

1:08:07.651 --> 1:08:11.186
<i>and maybe even have
some kids together some day.</i>

1:08:13.022 --> 1:08:16.391
<i>And as long as I keep
reminding myself of that</i>

1:08:16.393 --> 1:08:18.093
<i>I know I can resist.</i>

1:08:18.427 --> 1:08:21.529
<i>That's what's helped me so far</i>

1:08:21.531 --> 1:08:26.701
<i>because right now I feel like
everything's coming together.</i>

1:08:26.703 --> 1:08:28.937
<i>And I'm starting
to get my life back.</i>

1:08:29.772 --> 1:08:32.240
<i>So I feel good about today,</i>

1:08:32.242 --> 1:08:36.711
<i>and I'm trying to keep
doing this a few times a week.</i>

1:08:36.713 --> 1:08:41.983
<i>Hopefully, I'll be able to save up a
good amount before I get to Houston.</i>

1:08:43.486 --> 1:08:45.420
<i>Because I'm determined
to get to my goal</i>

1:08:46.522 --> 1:08:49.357
<i>and get weight loss surgery
no matter what.</i>

1:09:04.607 --> 1:09:06.941
<i>[Paul] It's been almost
two months</i>

1:09:06.943 --> 1:09:09.644
<i>since my last appointment
with Dr. Now.</i>

1:09:09.646 --> 1:09:12.680
<i>My next appointment
with him is in a week,</i>

1:09:12.682 --> 1:09:15.116
<i>and I'm feeling pretty good
about how I'm doing</i>

1:09:15.118 --> 1:09:17.285
<i>and my chances
of meeting my goal.</i>

1:09:19.221 --> 1:09:22.991
<i>Ultimately, I'm still not sure
what my weight loss is right now.</i>

1:09:23.626 --> 1:09:26.895
<i>But I stayed
on the diet completely</i>

1:09:26.897 --> 1:09:31.499
<i>and I made sure I'm paying
attention to my portion sizes.</i>

1:09:31.501 --> 1:09:36.804
<i>And I've just really simplified what
I eat and how I make my meals.</i>

1:09:36.806 --> 1:09:40.608
<i>The easiest thing for me is that
I'm hard boiling a bunch of eggs</i>

1:09:40.610 --> 1:09:42.844
<i>at the beginning of the week.</i>

1:09:42.846 --> 1:09:45.647
<i>And I put them in the fridge
to use through the week.</i>

1:09:45.649 --> 1:09:47.882
<i>Or I get some sliced
turkey with it.</i>

1:09:47.884 --> 1:09:52.220
<i>And then I make a simple salad so
I don't have to cook for every meal.</i>

1:09:52.922 --> 1:09:56.357
<i>Having to cook each meal
was taking a long time</i>

1:09:56.359 --> 1:09:59.027
<i>especially doing it
three times a day.</i>

1:10:00.095 --> 1:10:02.931
<i>And my frustration was that
it increases my temptation</i>

1:10:02.933 --> 1:10:05.767
<i>to order something
from somewhere</i>

1:10:05.769 --> 1:10:09.070
<i>because it's convenient,
and it's quick.</i>

1:10:09.672 --> 1:10:12.140
<i>But I've made sure
not to do that.</i>

1:10:12.841 --> 1:10:15.343
<i>So I'm resisting all temptations</i>

1:10:16.679 --> 1:10:17.912
<i>even at the carnival.</i>

1:10:17.914 --> 1:10:20.148
<i>I haven't given in once</i>

1:10:20.150 --> 1:10:22.717
<i>even when I'm around
all that food.</i>

1:10:22.719 --> 1:10:26.754
<i>So I feel like I'm getting more
control over my eating habits.</i>

1:10:26.789 --> 1:10:28.856
<i>Like Dr. Now said.</i>

1:10:28.858 --> 1:10:31.426
<i>And that makes me
feel good and confident</i>

1:10:31.428 --> 1:10:35.330
<i>I'm doing good and headed
in the direction I should.</i>

1:10:49.578 --> 1:10:53.881
<i>When I started,
I couldn't do a whole lot.</i>

1:10:53.883 --> 1:10:59.187
<i>Mostly I could only do the arm
exercises and the stretching.</i>

1:10:59.955 --> 1:11:02.056
<i>The upper body stuff.</i>

1:11:02.458 --> 1:11:05.026
<i>That's all something I could do.</i>

1:11:05.828 --> 1:11:09.097
<i>But it still made me really
tired by the time I finish.</i>

1:11:09.798 --> 1:11:12.500
<i>But now, I'm barely
breaking a sweat</i>

1:11:12.502 --> 1:11:15.003
<i>when I'm doing 'em,
and I can do 'em a lot faster</i>

1:11:15.005 --> 1:11:17.939
<i>because it hurts less
with all the movement.</i>

1:11:18.474 --> 1:11:19.941
<i>So I've been happy about that.</i>

1:11:19.943 --> 1:11:23.244
<i>But what's been really
is great is my walking.</i>

1:11:28.450 --> 1:11:30.752
<i>When I first started
five months ago,</i>

1:11:30.754 --> 1:11:33.588
<i>I could barely get to the end
of my mom's driveway,</i>

1:11:33.590 --> 1:11:35.723
<i>and even that wiped me out.</i>

1:11:35.725 --> 1:11:38.126
<i>And now, I can walk for blocks.</i>

1:11:38.794 --> 1:11:41.763
<i>And that's an amazing feeling.</i>

1:11:41.765 --> 1:11:44.299
<i>So far, my record is nine blocks</i>

1:11:44.301 --> 1:11:46.668
<i>and I'm working on ten.</i>

1:11:46.670 --> 1:11:51.773
<i>But I have to be careful not to
accidentally get too far past my limit.</i>

1:11:51.775 --> 1:11:55.410
<i>Because whatever extra
distance I push myself to go</i>

1:11:55.412 --> 1:11:56.844
<i>I have to cover it coming back.</i>

1:11:56.846 --> 1:11:59.681
<i>So it's like double that
when I do it.</i>

1:11:59.683 --> 1:12:02.417
<i>And I don't want to
end up hitting a wall</i>

1:12:02.419 --> 1:12:05.687
<i>before I go back home
and get stuck out here.</i>

1:12:05.689 --> 1:12:10.058
<i>So I just be careful when I
try to see if I can go further.</i>

1:12:10.426 --> 1:12:12.660
<i>So it's been a slower process</i>

1:12:12.662 --> 1:12:14.762
<i>figuring out what my limits are.</i>

1:12:14.764 --> 1:12:17.432
<i>But I'm really excited
by how far I've come</i>

1:12:17.434 --> 1:12:20.401
<i>with my walking and my stamina.</i>

1:12:20.403 --> 1:12:22.437
<i>Because that's been
the biggest thing for me.</i>

1:12:22.439 --> 1:12:25.606
<i>Being able to go places
changes everything for me.</i>

1:12:25.608 --> 1:12:29.510
<i>And it's opening up
a whole new world for me.</i>

1:12:29.512 --> 1:12:33.581
<i>Being able to work again
is a good example of that.</i>

1:12:33.583 --> 1:12:36.617
<i>So it's been amazing
to just go outside</i>

1:12:36.619 --> 1:12:39.921
<i>and enjoy being out
and looking at the ocean,</i>

1:12:39.923 --> 1:12:43.925
<i>and just take a moment
to enjoy life.</i>

1:12:43.927 --> 1:12:47.228
<i>It's been so long since I've
been able to do anything like that.</i>

1:12:47.930 --> 1:12:48.896
<i>So I feel great now.</i>

1:12:48.898 --> 1:12:51.999
<i>And I'm really excited
about my progress</i>

1:12:52.634 --> 1:12:56.304
<i>because I know I'm working
towards a better future now</i>

1:12:56.306 --> 1:12:58.773
<i>and I'm doing everything
I can to make sure</i>

1:12:58.775 --> 1:13:01.476
<i>nothing stops me
from doing that.</i>

1:13:01.478 --> 1:13:05.513
<i>So I'm just hoping next week
when I go back to see Dr. Now</i>

1:13:05.515 --> 1:13:08.716
<i>that my weight loss is enough
to make it to my goal</i>

1:13:08.718 --> 1:13:11.219
<i>to get approved
for weight loss surgery.</i>

1:13:11.787 --> 1:13:14.555
<i>So I can keep going
on this journey</i>

1:13:14.557 --> 1:13:16.991
<i>and make it to
where I need to be.</i>

1:13:23.866 --> 1:13:25.400
<i>[Paul] I'm back in Houston again</i>

1:13:25.402 --> 1:13:28.169
<i>for another appointment
with Dr. Now.</i>

1:13:29.304 --> 1:13:34.108
<i>I flew again just because it's
easier than having to drive in.</i>

1:13:36.945 --> 1:13:41.282
<i>And I know that Dr. Now prefers
me to put less strain on my body.</i>

1:13:44.987 --> 1:13:46.921
<i>But I'm less sore this time</i>

1:13:46.923 --> 1:13:49.023
<i>even from the last time I flew.</i>

1:13:49.558 --> 1:13:50.792
<i>So I think that's positive.</i>

1:13:50.794 --> 1:13:54.061
<i>It shows that I'm moving
in the right direction.</i>

1:13:54.596 --> 1:13:57.732
<i>So I'm feeling really good
about where I'm at.</i>

1:13:57.734 --> 1:14:01.202
<i>And my chances of being
where I need to be today.</i>

1:14:02.805 --> 1:14:05.940
<i>But like the other times,
I'm still nervous</i>

1:14:05.942 --> 1:14:07.708
<i>because I just don't know
what my weight's gonna be</i>

1:14:07.710 --> 1:14:10.978
<i>until I see it on the scale.</i>

1:14:11.814 --> 1:14:16.150
<i>But I've worked extremely hard
to qualify for Dr. Now's program</i>

1:14:16.152 --> 1:14:18.419
<i>and hopefully get
weight loss surgery.</i>

1:14:19.354 --> 1:14:21.989
Mr. McNeill.

1:14:21.991 --> 1:14:24.559
<i>[Paul] Because I know I'm not
gonna be able to move ahead</i>

1:14:24.561 --> 1:14:27.662
<i>unless I show him
I'm ready to work at this.</i>

1:14:27.664 --> 1:14:30.264
<i>So that's what I'm hoping
I do today.</i>

1:14:31.800 --> 1:14:35.002
<i>Because I know if I don't
I can't do his program.</i>

1:14:35.004 --> 1:14:37.605
<i>There's no other options
for me out there.</i>

1:14:37.607 --> 1:14:39.974
<i>So I really hope I did it.</i>

1:14:52.421 --> 1:14:56.591
<i>I'm back at Dr. Now's to see if
I made it to my goal this time.</i>

1:14:56.593 --> 1:14:58.259
<i>And I'm really hoping I did.</i>

1:14:58.894 --> 1:15:03.164
<i>Two months ago,
I made it down to 695.</i>

1:15:04.266 --> 1:15:06.501
<i>Dr. Now gave me
another weight loss goal</i>

1:15:06.503 --> 1:15:09.370
<i>to lose 50 pounds by that day.</i>

1:15:10.405 --> 1:15:14.342
<i>So if I made it
I'll be down to 645 today.</i>

1:15:17.846 --> 1:15:19.347
[nurse] Your weight is 641.

1:15:20.015 --> 1:15:21.249
Yes!

1:15:22.818 --> 1:15:24.919
<i>That's awesome.</i>

1:15:24.921 --> 1:15:26.888
<i>It felt really good to see
that number come up,</i>

1:15:26.890 --> 1:15:29.991
<i>I'm excited.
I'm really excited.</i>

1:15:29.993 --> 1:15:31.759
<i>I set my mind to something,
and I did it.</i>

1:15:31.761 --> 1:15:34.595
<i>And it wasn't easy.</i>

1:15:34.597 --> 1:15:37.899
<i>So it just feels really good
to see it pay off</i>

1:15:37.901 --> 1:15:40.968
<i>especially when I
wanted it so bad.</i>

1:15:40.970 --> 1:15:43.604
<i>So I'm hoping
that the next steps for me</i>

1:15:43.606 --> 1:15:46.707
<i>are to figure out
how to move to Houston.</i>

1:15:46.709 --> 1:15:48.776
<i>Because Dr. Now's
about to tell me</i>

1:15:48.778 --> 1:15:50.945
<i>I'm approved
for weight loss surgery.</i>

1:15:55.751 --> 1:15:57.752
Hey, Paul, how you doing?

1:15:57.754 --> 1:15:58.853
Good, Dr. Now,
how are you, sir?

1:15:58.855 --> 1:16:00.655
I'm doing well.

1:16:00.657 --> 1:16:03.658
So you made it down here
on your own again?

1:16:03.660 --> 1:16:05.860
Yes, sir, this time
it was easier,

1:16:05.862 --> 1:16:07.929
so I feel like what I'm doing
is paying off.

1:16:07.931 --> 1:16:13.200
Well, I agree with you because
you lost 54 pound, and that's great.

1:16:13.202 --> 1:16:15.369
Yes, sir. I almost
did a cartwheel.

1:16:17.406 --> 1:16:18.673
All right.

1:16:18.675 --> 1:16:22.243
So did you cut back
on your portion size?

1:16:22.245 --> 1:16:25.913
<i>Yes, sir, I did like you said and I
followed the portions in your book.</i>

1:16:25.915 --> 1:16:27.515
<i>And it was just like you told me</i>

1:16:27.517 --> 1:16:30.051
<i>because after a month
of never feeling full</i>

1:16:30.053 --> 1:16:32.653
<i>with that amount
I started to feel more full,</i>

1:16:32.655 --> 1:16:35.923
<i>not completely, but I was
getting more satisfied with less.</i>

1:16:35.925 --> 1:16:38.726
That's great.
That's good progress.

1:16:38.728 --> 1:16:40.828
Well I'm proud of you
for all your hard work.

1:16:40.830 --> 1:16:43.731
So I'm gonna approve you
for weight loss surgery.

1:16:43.733 --> 1:16:46.834
And I'll do that as soon as you
move down here to Houston.

1:16:46.836 --> 1:16:48.636
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1:16:48.638 --> 1:16:50.972
I'm so stoked. I'm so excited.

1:16:50.974 --> 1:16:53.774
I'm gonna move down
to Houston as soon as I can.

1:16:53.776 --> 1:16:55.009
Don't take too long.

1:16:55.011 --> 1:16:57.812
But if you do I expect you
to stay on track

1:16:57.814 --> 1:16:59.580
and lose at least
15 pound a month

1:16:59.582 --> 1:17:01.616
until we do your surgery

1:17:01.618 --> 1:17:03.651
which should be easier for
you, and it would be great

1:17:03.653 --> 1:17:06.654
if you get under 600
before your surgery

1:17:06.656 --> 1:17:08.723
because it will reduce
the strain on your system,

1:17:08.725 --> 1:17:11.926
and will be easier
with anesthesia and all that.

1:17:11.928 --> 1:17:13.628
So you think you can do that?

1:17:13.630 --> 1:17:15.796
Yes, sir, I can do that.

1:17:15.798 --> 1:17:18.766
I can stay on track
and lose the 15 pounds a month

1:17:18.768 --> 1:17:20.434
until we do the surgery.

1:17:20.436 --> 1:17:22.770
I'm gonna stick to my goals

1:17:22.772 --> 1:17:25.339
and keep on pushing
on the diet that you gave me.

1:17:25.341 --> 1:17:26.607
Okay, great.

1:17:26.609 --> 1:17:29.410
So I'm gonna set you an
appointment for two months from now.

1:17:29.412 --> 1:17:31.412
That'll give you enough time
to move down here.

1:17:31.414 --> 1:17:32.980
So you don't have to
make these trips.

1:17:32.982 --> 1:17:35.983
And keep me posted
about your timeframe

1:17:35.985 --> 1:17:36.817
when you're moving down here.

1:17:36.819 --> 1:17:38.853
But as long as
you stay on track,

1:17:38.855 --> 1:17:41.589
we'll keep moving forward
with your surgery, okay?

1:17:41.591 --> 1:17:42.790
That's great, doctor.

1:17:42.792 --> 1:17:44.725
I'm thankful that you
approved me for the surgery.

1:17:44.727 --> 1:17:46.627
It's a blessing.
Thank you so much.

1:17:46.629 --> 1:17:49.797
You're welcome.
I'm proud of your progress,

1:17:49.799 --> 1:17:53.701
keep working hard, and if you need
anything before then, give me a call.

1:17:53.703 --> 1:17:54.769
Thank you, and I will.

1:17:54.771 --> 1:17:57.138
- All right, take care.
- Bye-bye.

1:18:00.809 --> 1:18:02.576
<i>[Dr. Now] I'm very proud
of Paul.</i>

1:18:02.578 --> 1:18:05.713
He has worked hard to do
what he needs from the start.

1:18:05.715 --> 1:18:07.982
<i>So I have no doubt
about how dedicated he is</i>

1:18:07.984 --> 1:18:09.817
to change his life
and get healthy.

1:18:09.819 --> 1:18:13.554
<i>And I'm confident he's ready to
move ahead with weight loss surgery.</i>

1:18:13.556 --> 1:18:16.957
<i>And that it will be
a good tool that will help him</i>

1:18:16.959 --> 1:18:20.895
to continue doing what he
needs to get to his target weight.

1:18:20.897 --> 1:18:22.463
<i>So as soon as he
moves down here,</i>

1:18:22.465 --> 1:18:23.998
<i>we will take that step with him,</i>

1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:26.667
<i>and then continue working
to help him lose</i>

1:18:26.669 --> 1:18:29.070
<i>the 400 pounds he still needs</i>

1:18:29.072 --> 1:18:32.640
to get to his target weight
of 225 pounds.

1:18:32.642 --> 1:18:35.042
<i>And I think with what
I have seen from him so far,</i>

1:18:35.044 --> 1:18:37.945
he should be able
to do that within a year

1:18:37.947 --> 1:18:39.613
after his weight loss surgery,

1:18:39.615 --> 1:18:41.015
<i>as long as he stick with it,</i>

1:18:41.017 --> 1:18:43.284
<i>and keep working
as hard as he has so far.</i>

1:18:43.286 --> 1:18:45.619
<i>But I'm proud of him
for how he has done,</i>

1:18:45.621 --> 1:18:50.858
and I'm looking forward to seeing
even more progress from him soon.

1:18:50.860 --> 1:18:54.495
<i>[Paul] I'm excited, because this
means I can keep on moving forward</i>

1:18:54.497 --> 1:18:57.098
<i>to work towards
getting my life back.</i>

1:18:57.100 --> 1:18:59.500
<i>And I have a chance
to have what I want,</i>

1:18:59.502 --> 1:19:02.103
<i>which is a future with Jen.</i>

1:19:02.105 --> 1:19:04.772
<i>So I'm happy that I'm gonna be
able to take this next step</i>

1:19:04.774 --> 1:19:07.441
<i>to get closer to that.</i>

1:19:07.443 --> 1:19:10.211
<i>And I know this is
just a start for me really.</i>

1:19:10.213 --> 1:19:12.680
<i>And that there's
a lot of hard work ahead</i>

1:19:12.682 --> 1:19:16.383
<i>especially figuring out the move
to come down here and all that.</i>

1:19:16.385 --> 1:19:19.620
<i>But I'm ready to do this,
whatever I have to do</i>

1:19:19.622 --> 1:19:23.324
<i>to have the life that I want.
I'm ready for it.</i>

1:19:30.665 --> 1:19:32.666
<i>I flew back home yesterday.</i>

1:19:32.668 --> 1:19:34.802
<i>After my appointment
with Dr. Now,</i>

1:19:34.804 --> 1:19:37.671
<i>but I held off on telling
anyone my progress</i>

1:19:37.673 --> 1:19:39.907
<i>And that I got approved.</i>

1:19:39.909 --> 1:19:42.143
<i>But right now, I wanted
to do something special</i>

1:19:42.145 --> 1:19:43.310
<i>to tell Jen.</i>

1:19:46.915 --> 1:19:47.982
This is beautiful.

1:19:48.617 --> 1:19:49.650
Where are we going?

1:19:49.652 --> 1:19:53.954
Ah... Wouldn't you
like to know.

1:19:56.858 --> 1:20:01.061
<i>Ultimately, this is good news
as this is gonna save my life.</i>

1:20:01.063 --> 1:20:03.631
<i>But the bad part is
I have to move away,</i>

1:20:03.633 --> 1:20:05.666
<i>and that means that Jen and me</i>

1:20:05.668 --> 1:20:08.803
<i>have to have a long distance
relationship for a while.</i>

1:20:08.805 --> 1:20:12.473
<i>We won't be able to see each
other often during that time.</i>

1:20:12.475 --> 1:20:14.542
<i>And that's gonna be
really hard for me.</i>

1:20:14.544 --> 1:20:17.511
<i>But I'm doing this for us
because I know</i>

1:20:17.513 --> 1:20:21.015
<i>if I don't that I won't
have a future with Jen.</i>

1:20:21.850 --> 1:20:24.285
[Jen] Well, it's already
past our anniversary.

1:20:25.020 --> 1:20:28.589
It's not my birthday.
It's not your birthday.

1:20:28.591 --> 1:20:32.126
[Paul] It's not,
it's a surprise.

1:20:32.128 --> 1:20:33.694
<i>[Paul] I have plans
to tell her that I did it,</i>

1:20:33.696 --> 1:20:36.664
<i>and that this is
actually happening.</i>

1:20:36.666 --> 1:20:40.301
<i>So I'm moving to Houston, but
I'm gonna make her a promise.</i>

1:20:40.303 --> 1:20:42.770
<i>In one year, I'm gonna
lose the weight</i>

1:20:42.772 --> 1:20:45.239
<i>and come and take her
back to the beach.</i>

1:20:46.675 --> 1:20:50.177
It's been a minute since
we've been to the beach, huh?

1:20:50.179 --> 1:20:52.646
- It has.
<i>- [Paul] She loves the beach.</i>

1:20:52.648 --> 1:20:53.714
Whoo!

1:20:53.716 --> 1:20:55.683
<i>[Paul] It's one
of her favorite places.</i>

1:20:55.685 --> 1:20:58.219
<i>But I've never been able
to go with her.</i>

1:20:58.221 --> 1:21:00.020
I can't wait to be able
to walk on the beach.

1:21:00.022 --> 1:21:01.455
[Jen] Me, too.

1:21:01.457 --> 1:21:04.892
<i>[Paul] It's impossible
at my size to walk on sand,</i>

1:21:04.894 --> 1:21:08.963
<i>because my weight makes it
shift too much to walk on.</i>

1:21:08.965 --> 1:21:11.632
<i>So my commitment to her
is that I'm gonna go work hard</i>

1:21:11.634 --> 1:21:13.067
<i>to get healthy,</i>

1:21:13.069 --> 1:21:15.302
<i>to lose all the weight
in a year.</i>

1:21:17.105 --> 1:21:18.172
I'm gonna spin you
around, all right?

1:21:18.607 --> 1:21:20.341
Ready? Ooh-wee!

1:21:23.645 --> 1:21:25.779
<i>[Paul] The main reason
I'm doing this</i>

1:21:25.781 --> 1:21:29.016
<i>is to have a better life
with her and Riley someday.</i>

1:21:29.018 --> 1:21:31.352
<i>And I want that day to be soon.</i>

1:21:32.721 --> 1:21:33.921
So what's up?

1:21:33.923 --> 1:21:37.291
So you want to know
why I brought you here, right?

1:21:37.859 --> 1:21:40.194
I know I have a problem.

1:21:41.062 --> 1:21:43.731
I had to take this leap,

1:21:43.733 --> 1:21:46.934
and have the surgery
by going to Houston.

1:21:47.769 --> 1:21:51.438
And I know that you can't go,

1:21:51.440 --> 1:21:54.508
because there's work and Riley.

1:21:54.510 --> 1:21:58.746
I want you to know that
when I'm done with the surgery,

1:21:58.748 --> 1:22:00.547
I'm gonna push myself
to lose all this weight.

1:22:00.549 --> 1:22:03.384
Right now I'm not able
to walk on this beach.

1:22:03.386 --> 1:22:06.787
I'm gonna make this promise that
we're gonna walk on this beach together

1:22:06.789 --> 1:22:09.423
and be happy
for the rest of our lives.

1:22:10.759 --> 1:22:12.293
I know you can do this.

1:22:13.194 --> 1:22:15.195
- I love you.
- I love you.

1:22:19.534 --> 1:22:20.534
I love you.

1:22:20.536 --> 1:22:22.703
<i>[Jen] I understand
why Paul has to go,</i>

1:22:22.705 --> 1:22:25.773
<i>but I'm not gonna be able
to go to Houston with him.</i>

1:22:25.775 --> 1:22:31.045
I think the hardest thing is
we're gonna be apart 1,400 miles.

1:22:31.047 --> 1:22:33.747
I feel like our relationship
is strong enough

1:22:33.749 --> 1:22:36.784
to withstand this time away.

1:22:36.786 --> 1:22:39.086
<i>I think it's vital for him
to get healthy,</i>

1:22:39.088 --> 1:22:40.988
<i>because if he doesn't,</i>

1:22:40.990 --> 1:22:44.692
the strain that the weight
does put on his body

1:22:44.694 --> 1:22:47.428
I feel will cut
his life shorter.

1:22:47.430 --> 1:22:49.330
<i>I think if Paul lost
a lot of weight</i>

1:22:49.332 --> 1:22:51.899
<i>he would be able to come out
and do more things</i>

1:22:51.901 --> 1:22:58.138
<i>and be able to spend time
doing those things with Riley and I.</i>

1:22:58.140 --> 1:23:00.441
I want to be able
to do things with him.

1:23:00.909 --> 1:23:02.876
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

1:23:02.878 --> 1:23:04.712
<i>Paul made a promise to me</i>

1:23:04.714 --> 1:23:07.748
that he was gonna come back
and take a walk

1:23:07.750 --> 1:23:09.483
along the beach with me.

1:23:09.485 --> 1:23:12.786
<i>I feel like that's important because
the beach is one of my favorite places,</i>

1:23:12.788 --> 1:23:15.956
and he can't
walk with me right now.

1:23:15.958 --> 1:23:18.659
So I think
it's a really nice promise.

1:23:18.661 --> 1:23:20.761
And I would love to walk
on the beach with Paul.

1:23:20.763 --> 1:23:21.895
<i>That would make me very happy.</i>

1:23:21.897 --> 1:23:24.131
And I'm definitely gonna
hold him to it.

1:23:24.133 --> 1:23:26.700
<i>I think that Paul will be
very successful.</i>

1:23:26.702 --> 1:23:28.802
I'm absolutely gonna support him

1:23:28.804 --> 1:23:30.037
<i>in his quest to lose weight.</i>

1:23:30.039 --> 1:23:31.739
What sounds good to you?

1:23:31.741 --> 1:23:33.440
[Paul] Need something healthy.

1:23:33.442 --> 1:23:37.678
<i>[Paul] Jen changed my life
and gave me purpose again.</i>

1:23:37.680 --> 1:23:40.414
<i>So I owe her this, and even
though it's gonna be hard</i>

1:23:40.416 --> 1:23:42.016
<i>for both of us to be apart,</i>

1:23:42.018 --> 1:23:46.186
<i>I know we'll manage this and
figure it out to make it work.</i>

1:23:46.821 --> 1:23:49.857
- Just the chicken.
- Chicken?

1:23:49.859 --> 1:23:52.826
- Do you want black beans?
- No beans.

1:23:52.828 --> 1:23:53.727
No beans?

1:23:53.729 --> 1:23:56.897
No sour cream, no cheese.

1:23:56.899 --> 1:23:58.332
So no dairy on it.

1:23:58.334 --> 1:24:02.036
<i>[Paul] Thankfully, I have a little
more time before I'm leaving.</i>

1:24:02.437 --> 1:24:04.371
And a large ice water please.

1:24:05.106 --> 1:24:07.841
<i>I want to get my surgery
as soon as possible</i>

1:24:07.843 --> 1:24:10.377
<i>so the second that
I have everything I need,</i>

1:24:10.379 --> 1:24:13.914
<i>and everything lined up,
I'm making the move.</i>

1:24:13.916 --> 1:24:17.317
<i>But until then, I'm making
sure I don't slack on my diet.</i>

1:24:17.319 --> 1:24:19.286
<i>Dr. Now warned me about that.</i>

1:24:19.821 --> 1:24:21.522
<i>But I'm sticking to my diet.</i>

1:24:21.524 --> 1:24:23.957
<i>Because Dr. Now also told me</i>

1:24:23.959 --> 1:24:27.361
<i>if I don't stay on track,
then I'll lose my approval,</i>

1:24:27.363 --> 1:24:29.663
<i>and I can't let that happen.</i>

1:24:29.665 --> 1:24:32.966
<i>But I know this means I have
a whole lot of work ahead,</i>

1:24:32.968 --> 1:24:36.503
<i>not just to get ready
for Houston and the move,</i>

1:24:36.505 --> 1:24:38.906
<i>but to lose the weight
and to get to where I need.</i>

1:24:38.908 --> 1:24:41.975
<i>But I'm gonna work
my hardest to make sure</i>

1:24:41.977 --> 1:24:44.378
<i>that all that happens
as soon as possible.</i>

1:24:46.047 --> 1:24:48.415
I'd offer you a bite, but
you can't have the tortilla.

1:24:49.751 --> 1:24:50.717
I don't need a bite, baby.

1:24:50.785 --> 1:24:53.020
I got this salad and it's good.

1:24:53.022 --> 1:24:58.258
<i>Every choice I make from
here on out has one purpose.</i>

1:24:58.260 --> 1:25:00.828
<i>To get the life I want with Jen</i>

1:25:00.830 --> 1:25:03.497
<i>so I'm using that
to keep me motivated</i>

1:25:03.499 --> 1:25:06.100
<i>for every minute of every day,</i>

1:25:06.102 --> 1:25:08.569
<i>so I move closer
and closer to my goal,</i>

1:25:08.571 --> 1:25:10.771
<i>and that life,
so I can get back here</i>

1:25:10.773 --> 1:25:14.007
<i>and keep that promise I made
to the love of my life.</i>

1:25:14.009 --> 1:25:16.610
<i>And start the life with her
that I'm dreaming of.</i>

1:25:16.612 --> 1:25:18.979
<i>And I can't wait for that.</i>

1:25:18.981 --> 1:25:20.881
Wow, you seem
really serious about this.

1:25:20.948 --> 1:25:23.083
I gotta be.

1:25:23.085 --> 1:25:24.985
Gotta make a better life
for both of us.
