After joining the
military,

00:22.655 --> 00:24.590
I never thought that
I'd have to leave home

00:25.725 --> 00:27.426
just to return and face tragedy.

00:30.830 --> 00:32.465
There comes a point in time in
life

00:34.366 --> 00:36.435
where things happen out of our
control,

00:38.071 --> 00:40.604
but we have to face the
consequences

00:40.606 --> 00:41.973
that change our lives.

00:44.343 --> 00:45.710
Forever.

01:25.988 --> 01:29.055
"and every tongue which
rises against you in judgment

01:29.057 --> 01:30.759
"you shall condemn."

01:35.731 --> 01:36.763

Take a look at that.

04:10.660 --> 04:11.962
You look like someone just
died.

04:16.166 --> 04:17.232
Two years on this fucking case.

04:17.233 --> 04:18.666
I know.

04:18.668 --> 04:20.135
I was the lead investigator on
this.

04:20.137 --> 04:21.971
You guys are gonna
serve me with this shit?

04:21.973 --> 04:23.872
You fucking joking!

04:23.874 --> 04:24.940
Morgan, just...

04:24.942 --> 04:25.808
It's Richardson, isn't it?

04:25.810 --> 04:27.042
That fucking cock sucker!

04:27.044 --> 04:28.143
He's always had it out for me.

04:33.551 --> 04:34.217

04:34.919 --> 04:35.751
You'll get through this, man.

04:35.753 --> 04:37.753

do.

04:37.755 --> 04:38.689
Bullshit.

04:39.825 --> 04:41.559
You fucking tell Richardson
that.

04:55.008 --> 04:57.774
After joining the
military,

04:57.776 --> 04:59.812
I always knew I'd be away from
my family,

05:02.215 --> 05:03.282
but I never thought

05:05.118 --> 05:07.820
that I'd return home just to
face tragedy.

05:12.592 --> 05:13.659
Now my brother's dead.

05:15.862 --> 05:17.231
They have no suspects.

05:19.366 --> 05:21.601
And that's just something I
can't let go.

05:56.372 --> 05:59.273
We got contact, we got
contact!

05:59.275 --> 06:00.407
We have contact on the left!

06:08.250 --> 06:10.653
Set up a diamond perimeter.

06:11.687 --> 06:13.188
Get up there, goddamit.

06:13.190 --> 06:16.191
Get over there, soon as
upriver, nobody gets out.

06:19.329 --> 06:21.196
What's the sitrep, what's going
on?

06:21.198 --> 06:22.864
Dammit, there's a shooter on the
roof.

06:22.866 --> 06:24.399
We're taking fire.

06:24.401 --> 06:25.735
Contact, contact.

06:29.806 --> 06:34.110
We need a medivac, we need
a medivac immediately.

06:54.466 --> 06:56.433
Special Agent Ruiz.

06:56.435 --> 06:57.300
Nice to meet you.

06:57.302 --> 06:59.302
I'm not here to barge or
interrupt.

06:59.304 --> 07:02.105
We're just here for the
briefing of the case.

07:02.107 --> 07:05.842
The DEA's declined to comment
if Morgan is even part

07:05.844 --> 07:06.912
of the agency or not.

07:08.481 --> 07:10.046
You know what, he'll
be in a few minutes.

07:10.048 --> 07:11.482
Why don't you ask him
yourselves?

07:11.484 --> 07:13.984
Well, I'd like to hear your
opinion.

07:13.986 --> 07:16.222
Okay, well.

07:18.057 --> 07:19.790
The US Drug Enforcement Agency

07:19.792 --> 07:23.995
has labeled Morgan as the
golden child around here.

07:23.997 --> 07:26.998
You know he's earned multiple
plaudits for his work

07:27.000 --> 07:29.836
for the DEA with the New
Orleans field division.

07:30.737 --> 07:33.438
There's also a legend of him
being known

07:33.440 --> 07:36.241
as the "White Devil".

07:37.178 --> 07:39.077
Yeah, the "White Devil",
how crazy is that?

07:39.079 --> 07:41.280
There's also a rapper out of
Houston

07:41.282 --> 07:43.515
who's done some name checking
and called Morgan out

07:43.517 --> 07:44.516
in one of his songs.

07:44.518 --> 07:46.752
You know Morgan has the
balls to play that song

07:46.754 --> 07:48.220
every time he does a drug
arrest?

07:48.222 --> 07:49.221
Wow.

07:49.223 --> 07:50.456
That's some crazy shit.

07:50.458 --> 07:51.757
Hello, Sherri.

07:51.759 --> 07:52.925
Hey.

07:52.927 --> 07:54.062

07:56.364 --> 07:57.864
What you doing out here,
brother?

07:57.866 --> 07:59.199
Not too bad, not too bad.

07:59.201 --> 08:00.533
What are you doing here?

08:00.535 --> 08:02.869
He's here for the
debriefing of the case.

08:02.871 --> 08:03.536
All right, all right.

08:03.538 --> 08:04.605
The more the merrier.

08:04.607 --> 08:09.008
Welcome to the shit show
that is the Torres Cartel.

08:09.010 --> 08:11.347
Here we got the big
cheese Ignacio right here.

08:13.382 --> 08:14.381
We know he's got, we
got him on a murder here

08:14.383 --> 08:17.351
but you know, we can't
pin it to him just yet.

08:17.353 --> 08:19.789
This guy right here Clavo is his
cousin.

08:20.523 --> 08:22.523
Now he's not even a US citizen.

08:22.525 --> 08:25.025
We can't even find him,
is that right Sherri?

08:25.027 --> 08:25.893
Right.

08:25.895 --> 08:26.561
Are we looking?

08:26.563 --> 08:27.562
We are, we are.

08:27.564 --> 08:29.863
We have a few leads but
nothing solid just yet.

08:29.865 --> 08:30.599
Okay.

08:30.601 --> 08:31.433
Other cousin right here,
Lorenzo.

08:31.435 --> 08:33.503
Now he is a US citizen.

08:34.438 --> 08:36.371
We pinched him a couple times.

08:36.373 --> 08:39.474
Once on a DUI, another one on a
possession

08:39.476 --> 08:41.308
of a controlled substance.

08:41.311 --> 08:44.512
Now he is a US citizen, we did
let him go

08:44.514 --> 08:46.114
'cause nothing stuck yet.

08:46.116 --> 08:47.916
But he is gonna fuck up.

08:47.918 --> 08:49.552
Got a couple baby mamas.

08:49.554 --> 08:51.456
So it's just a matter of time.

08:52.823 --> 08:54.457
What you got for me, Sherri?

08:54.459 --> 08:57.360
Lorenzo Torres, that is all.

08:57.362 --> 09:00.465
Born February 27, 1987.

09:07.038 --> 09:08.971
This my homeboy
Lorenzo.

09:08.973 --> 09:11.475
Met him when he was locked up a
year ago.

09:11.477 --> 09:13.143
He'd been down since.

09:13.145 --> 09:15.112
He spent time in Mexico with his
big bro

09:15.114 --> 09:17.581
but I don't ask him too much
about it.

09:17.583 --> 09:19.883
We just some regular mess up on
the hood.

09:19.885 --> 09:22.388
We're Hispanic, or you could say
Latino.

09:23.355 --> 09:26.189
My pop's from Juarez and ma from
Laredo.

09:26.191 --> 09:29.394
I was born here in Dallas,
Texas.

That's Skii right there.

09:31.464 --> 09:32.332

We ain't no criminals or major
dealers

09:46.346 --> 09:47.481
but we do get that work.

09:49.049 --> 09:51.916
I guess that's one of the
perks of being Latino.

09:51.918 --> 09:53.152
You always know somebody who got

12:27.248 --> 12:28.415
But before all that, man,

12:28.417 --> 12:30.817
it's all about hard work man.

12:30.819 --> 12:32.652
You don't just come down
candy just for free, man.

12:32.654 --> 12:35.322
You gotta go out there and work
hard, man.

12:35.324 --> 12:37.591
That way once you get
it, you're protected,

12:37.593 --> 12:39.125
you know what I'm saying?

12:39.127 --> 12:40.227
And cherish it, man.

12:40.229 --> 12:43.263
Straight up, know what I'm
saying?

12:43.265 --> 12:44.264
You get it easy, you gonna lose
it easy,

12:44.266 --> 12:46.066
know what I'm talking about?

12:46.068 --> 12:46.736
For real.

12:48.237 --> 12:49.302
I never
seen him much after that

12:49.304 --> 12:51.106
but life went on.

12:52.775 --> 12:54.709
Go right there.

12:54.711 --> 12:56.277
Follow me, right way.

12:56.279 --> 12:57.144

13:07.925 --> 13:09.791
Just don't come back round
here thinking you're the shit

13:09.793 --> 13:12.796

your little uniform on and shit.

13:13.764 --> 13:15.864
We been right here fighting a
war.

13:15.866 --> 13:17.466
So you think y'all

13:23.407 --> 13:24.273
Okay.

13:25.209 --> 13:27.109
You get them niggas, and y'all
follow me.

13:27.111 --> 13:28.778
Teach you how to fight a war.

13:28.780 --> 13:31.714
That was the last time
I saw my brother alive.

13:31.716 --> 13:33.216
Fuck!

13:33.218 --> 13:34.084
Fuck!

13:44.563 --> 13:45.428
What's going on, brother?

13:45.430 --> 13:46.429
What's up, brother?

13:46.431 --> 13:47.363
Appreciate you coming out.

13:47.365 --> 13:49.368
Hey man, no problem, what's
going on?

13:50.636 --> 13:52.670
You and I go way back.

13:52.672 --> 13:55.873
And I wish we were meeting here
under better circumstances.

13:55.875 --> 13:57.708
But I got a DA friend of mine,

13:57.710 --> 13:59.577
New Orleans Division.

13:59.579 --> 14:03.615
Bottom line, I'm being
under investigation.

14:03.617 --> 14:06.551
I led up a couple multi agency
task forces

14:06.553 --> 14:08.185
out of New Orleans.

14:08.187 --> 14:10.555
And right now I'm under
investigation

14:10.557 --> 14:11.558
for some misconduct.

14:12.826 --> 14:14.292
Don't fucking hold back on me.

14:14.294 --> 14:16.328
Tell me what the fuck I'm
facing.

14:16.330 --> 14:18.296
Look man, I'm gonna be honest
with you.

14:18.298 --> 14:20.800
This does not look good at all.

14:20.802 --> 14:22.735
What we got going on right now
is that

14:22.737 --> 14:25.236
the task force right now is
suspected

14:25.238 --> 14:28.173
of tampering of evidence,
extortion, contraband,

14:28.175 --> 14:30.409
conspiracy, drugs, stealing
money,

14:30.411 --> 14:32.278
all kinds of crazy shit, man.

14:32.280 --> 14:33.713
Right now.

14:33.715 --> 14:35.247
How do I get rid of this shit?

14:35.249 --> 14:36.882
Best thing to do is just lay
low,

14:36.884 --> 14:38.718
let it ride out, stay under the
radar.

14:38.720 --> 14:40.286
Fuck it.

14:40.288 --> 14:41.220
Under the radar?

14:41.222 --> 14:43.255
You know how good I stay under
the radar?

14:43.257 --> 14:46.493
I'm this goddamn close to
busting this case wide open.

14:46.495 --> 14:49.163
Yeah, but you're this
close to getting busted too.

14:49.965 --> 14:52.599
You can't have a bird in one
hand and shit in the other.

14:52.601 --> 14:54.835
Just lay low and let it ride.

14:54.837 --> 14:56.171
Do what you do best.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.705
Stay away from the radar.

14:58.707 --> 14:59.773
Appreciate it.

Well I gotta go to class.

16:28.869 --> 16:29.935

17:54.792 --> 17:56.458
What about our trip to...

17:56.460 --> 17:58.929
Hey, why are you
hassling me with the trip?

17:58.931 --> 18:01.397
You know I already got that trip
handled.

18:01.399 --> 18:02.098
Have you?

18:02.100 --> 18:03.033
I've got a travel agent.

18:03.035 --> 18:04.100
She does all that.

18:04.102 --> 18:05.501
Really?

18:05.503 --> 18:07.873
Go log into my profile and
check it out.

18:09.174 --> 18:10.709
Okay let's see.

18:13.445 --> 18:15.478
Actually
you know, I don't think

18:15.480 --> 18:17.416
I actually booked that.

18:19.785 --> 18:21.185
Morgan, what, what do you
mean?

18:21.187 --> 18:25.556
I mean, you haven't booked that?

18:25.558 --> 18:26.858
How can I trust you?

18:26.860 --> 18:27.925
Are you serious?

18:27.927 --> 18:29.560
Yes I am.

18:29.562 --> 18:31.195
Okay, I forgot to book it.

18:31.197 --> 18:32.997
I've got an agent, she'll handle
it.

18:32.999 --> 18:34.432
Just relax.

18:34.434 --> 18:37.468
Why can't you, yes,
it's not the first time

18:37.470 --> 18:39.905
in the relationship if you can't
handle

18:39.907 --> 18:43.642
- even simple trip.
- Oh my goodness.

18:43.644 --> 18:45.944
You're blowing this way out of
proportion.

18:45.946 --> 18:48.814
I just hate when you
lie, okay?

18:48.816 --> 18:49.681
Lying?

18:49.683 --> 18:50.983
Yes.

18:50.985 --> 18:53.051
I didn't get the trip booked,
so what?

18:53.053 --> 18:55.687
We had a great dinner, we
had a great time at the pool.

18:55.689 --> 18:56.555
Morgan!

18:56.557 --> 18:57.623
What?

18:57.625 --> 18:59.658
It's about our future.

18:59.660 --> 19:02.829
It's about our relationship,
about trust.

19:02.831 --> 19:03.796
Oh my.

19:03.798 --> 19:05.932
You think the trips,
you think the jewelry,

19:05.934 --> 19:08.568
you think the hotels, the
drinks?

19:08.570 --> 19:12.472
You think that comes on a
50,000 dollar a year salary?

19:12.474 --> 19:13.141
It doesn't.

19:15.510 --> 19:18.045
Where does it come from?

19:18.047 --> 19:22.149
If you're in jail or you are
dead,

19:22.151 --> 19:23.918
it doesn't matter.

19:23.920 --> 19:26.687
I don't care about all that
stuff.

19:26.689 --> 19:27.688
I don't care.

19:27.690 --> 19:29.425
Morgan, who are you?

19:30.493 --> 19:31.158

20:39.798 --> 20:41.966
Entered the Police Academy.

20:41.968 --> 20:43.668

20:43.670 --> 20:46.270
You know, I really wanted

20:46.272 --> 20:48.975
I wanted to be one of the good

20:50.176 --> 20:53.212

20:53.214 --> 20:57.251
all that money, all those
women, all that booze,

20:58.285 --> 21:01.086

22:07.291 --> 22:10.027
I bet your mom is so proud of
you.

22:11.362 --> 22:12.761
Hmm.

22:12.763 --> 22:13.864
Have you called her?

22:16.934 --> 22:17.801
Nah.

22:18.702 --> 22:19.636
Not yet.

22:22.173 --> 22:23.041
So tell me.

22:24.309 --> 22:25.343
What happened?

22:29.214 --> 22:31.082
There's an investigation.

22:34.153 --> 22:36.020
He was found on the side of the
road.

22:40.459 --> 22:41.327
He was shot.

22:47.967 --> 22:50.901
The detectives left a number

22:50.903 --> 22:55.108
but I haven't heard from
anyone in two weeks.

23:02.382 --> 23:04.115
This what I'm gonna do.

23:04.117 --> 23:08.088
Since I'm stateside, I'm
gonna visit the cemetery.

23:10.857 --> 23:12.025
Gonna make some calls.

23:16.397 --> 23:18.099

So is that an invitation?

25:11.318 --> 25:12.584
It's definitely an invitation.

27:05.003 --> 27:07.270
I'm trying to go to Hawaii too.

27:07.272 --> 27:08.672
Somewhere, I mean.

27:08.674 --> 27:10.106

27:12.745 --> 27:15.046
I'll be in contact, I'll text
you.

27:57.625 --> 27:58.491
What are you doing here, boy?

27:58.493 --> 27:59.459
Dammit, dad.

27:59.461 --> 28:02.195
Jesus Christ, you scared
the shit out of me.

28:02.197 --> 28:04.030
Pussy.

28:04.032 --> 28:06.332
It's nice to see you too, dad.

28:06.334 --> 28:08.236
You know I always wanted a
daughter.

28:09.137 --> 28:12.171
And I reckon you're the
closest thing I'll ever get.

28:12.173 --> 28:14.708
Again, what the hell
are you doing here, boy?

28:14.710 --> 28:17.578
Dammit dad, why do we
have to do this every time?

28:17.580 --> 28:20.481
Why can't I just stop by and see
my dad?

28:20.483 --> 28:22.449
I went to the grocery
store to pick some stuff up

28:22.451 --> 28:24.117
and from the looks of this
place,

28:24.119 --> 28:25.185
it's a fucking mess.

28:25.187 --> 28:27.488
Looks like you could use
a little help around here.

28:27.490 --> 28:29.424
I don't need your charity.

28:29.426 --> 28:30.825
And I certainly don't need you
snooping

28:30.827 --> 28:32.159
around my apartment.

28:32.161 --> 28:33.728
Why don't you take your
groceries

28:33.730 --> 28:35.298
and get the hell out of here!

28:39.736 --> 28:41.102
You know I don't even know why
I bother

28:41.104 --> 28:42.370
with your sorry ass.

28:42.372 --> 28:43.605
The only real reason I stopped
by

28:43.607 --> 28:46.575
is because mom keeps bugging
the shit out of me about you.

28:46.577 --> 28:48.378
And you never answer your damn
phone!

28:49.312 --> 28:51.312
What the fuck does
she care about me, huh?

28:51.314 --> 28:53.482
She walked out on us, remember?

28:53.484 --> 28:54.519
She left me.

28:55.586 --> 28:57.453
So don't you come here
with that lame ass excuse

28:57.455 --> 28:59.588
that she's worried about me.

28:59.590 --> 29:01.657
She was selfish and weak.

29:01.659 --> 29:03.294
At least Peter and I saw that.

29:05.263 --> 29:07.463
Why you chose to go and live
with her,

29:07.465 --> 29:08.698
I'll never understand.

29:08.700 --> 29:10.266
You know, if you put down the
bottle

29:10.268 --> 29:11.801
and come join the rest of the
world,

29:11.803 --> 29:13.403
quit mourning Peter's death,

29:13.405 --> 29:15.338
maybe your life wouldn't be such
a mess!

29:15.340 --> 29:18.508
Don't you ever talk about
your brother like that.

29:18.510 --> 29:20.744
At least he was a real man.

29:20.746 --> 29:22.813
You think you're a detective?

29:22.815 --> 29:25.584
You're so fucking crooked
you can't even see straight.

29:27.252 --> 29:29.121
You always were a mama's boy.

29:30.222 --> 29:33.724
And your face, it reminds me of
her.

29:33.726 --> 29:35.459
So why don't you take your
groceries

29:35.461 --> 29:36.627
and get out!

29:36.629 --> 29:39.898
I don't need you spying on
what I have for that bitch.

29:39.900 --> 29:42.700
You know, let me let you in
on a little secret, old man.

29:42.702 --> 29:45.202
Peter never even wanted to
enlist.

29:45.204 --> 29:47.171
He hated the military.

29:47.173 --> 29:48.640
Yeah, that's right.

29:48.642 --> 29:50.207
He only did it to please your
sorry ass

29:50.209 --> 29:52.411
and to get away from all
your overbearing bullshit!

29:52.413 --> 29:54.479
I'll kill you, you son of a
bitch!

29:54.481 --> 29:55.683
Dad!

29:56.617 --> 29:58.350
Leave me alone.

29:58.352 --> 29:59.219
Just go!

30:02.423 --> 30:03.290
Get out!

30:04.793 --> 30:07.328
And don't you ever come back!

33:51.897 --> 33:53.664
I had five of my boys killed
last year

33:53.666 --> 33:55.065
in one day alone.

33:55.067 --> 33:57.000
I don't want a part of that
anymore.

33:57.002 --> 33:58.136
I want out.

33:58.138 --> 34:00.071
I got one more deal.

34:00.073 --> 34:04.776
I close this out, take my
early retirement, my pension,

34:04.778 --> 34:06.512
then I ride off in the sunset.

34:07.446 --> 34:09.449
Don't forget to send me a
postcard.

34:10.583 --> 34:11.783
Don't be surprised if you
never hear

34:11.784 --> 34:13.418
from me again, brother.

34:13.420 --> 34:15.522
They don't make them like
you anymore, brother.

34:21.862 --> 34:23.663
This is Sherri
Daniels.

34:24.531 --> 34:26.067
I've known her since high
school.

34:27.735 --> 34:30.438
We've always, always given tips.

34:39.780 --> 34:41.147
That was kind of fun.

34:41.149 --> 34:42.916
But you can keep the tacos.

34:42.918 --> 34:45.185
It beats eating them RAs.

34:45.187 --> 34:46.054
That's nasty.

34:47.755 --> 34:49.623
But you know, it's better
times now

34:49.625 --> 34:51.591
being back stateside,

34:51.592 --> 34:54.159
being close to somebody...

34:54.161 --> 34:55.862
Don't act like you weren't
near women

34:55.864 --> 34:58.899
that were soft and getting cozy.

34:58.901 --> 35:00.234
Not as soft as you.

35:00.236 --> 35:01.104
Oh really?

35:03.773 --> 35:06.007
Oh wait a minute, soldier.

35:06.009 --> 35:06.774
You're getting a little close.

35:06.776 --> 35:08.111
- Excuse me again.
- Too fast.

35:09.112 --> 35:11.012
Were you able to find a name

35:11.014 --> 35:13.648
like associated with the case?

35:13.650 --> 35:15.616
Yeah, I was.

35:15.618 --> 35:16.484
Really?

35:16.486 --> 35:17.985
Yeah.

35:17.987 --> 35:19.054
What was his name?

35:19.056 --> 35:21.256
The guy's name was Clavo.

35:21.258 --> 35:22.425
Real bad guy.

35:23.160 --> 35:24.492
Clavo.

35:24.494 --> 35:25.162
Yeah.

35:29.266 --> 35:31.867
Know what, I'm gonna go.

35:31.869 --> 35:32.968
Call me later.

35:32.970 --> 35:34.171
Stay out of trouble.

35:39.110 --> 35:39.978
Clavo.

36:26.693 --> 36:27.894
Open up, bro.

36:39.941 --> 36:40.942
He done for.

36:42.977 --> 36:43.976
Hey!

36:45.213 --> 36:46.612
What are you trying to kill me,
dad?

36:46.614 --> 36:47.680
Put the gun down, dad.

36:47.682 --> 36:48.714
Are you trying to kill me?

36:48.716 --> 36:49.749
It's your fucking son.

36:49.751 --> 36:50.950
It's the state of Texas.

36:50.952 --> 36:54.053
Put the fucking
gun down, dad, you crazy fuck.

36:54.055 --> 36:55.690
Break into somebody's domain.

36:56.591 --> 36:58.060
Pay with your life, asshole!

37:02.730 --> 37:04.663
Dad, you're a fucking mess.

37:04.665 --> 37:06.601
Peter, Peter.

37:08.137 --> 37:09.703
Let's go get you cleaned up.

37:09.705 --> 37:11.372
All right we'll go to the
bathroom then.

37:11.374 --> 37:12.839
Lean forward.

37:12.841 --> 37:15.075
All right, put your arm over my
shoulder.

37:15.077 --> 37:16.843
Yeah, yeah.

37:16.845 --> 37:18.647
Come on, up, up, up.

37:20.016 --> 37:20.883
Let's go.

37:22.185 --> 37:23.053
Feet up.

37:33.129 --> 37:36.130
Well are you
just gonna stand there?

37:36.132 --> 37:37.901
Trust me, dad, I ain't
looking.

37:40.004 --> 37:42.273
I just talked to, need
you to talk to Morgan.

37:43.874 --> 37:45.242
I think he's lost his way, son.

37:46.677 --> 37:48.946
I love you both, I love you.

37:49.880 --> 37:52.881
I love you, son, I love my kids.

37:52.883 --> 37:54.317
You're a good son, Peter.

37:54.319 --> 37:55.920
And, up, up, up.

37:56.854 --> 38:00.025

forget, talk to Morgan.

Morgan.

me

42:19.297 --> 42:21.430
you let the motherfucker get
away.

42:21.432 --> 42:23.566
Find that fucking money and call
me back.

42:23.568 --> 42:25.301
Don't call me back if
you ain't got that money

42:25.303 --> 42:27.171
and if you don't, you already
know.

42:29.407 --> 42:31.307
I don't know
what the fuck happened.

42:31.309 --> 42:33.610
It's supposed to be a quick
deal.

42:33.612 --> 42:35.245
I got off to take a piss

42:35.247 --> 42:37.081
and some dude run up and blasted
DD.

42:38.350 --> 42:39.218
I booked.

42:40.486 --> 42:42.085
And a car shows up towed to my
house

42:42.087 --> 42:44.154
with all the money inside.

42:44.156 --> 42:46.258
And I know somebody's
coming back for this.

42:48.227 --> 42:49.596
I kind of just wanted to take
off.

42:50.530 --> 42:51.564
But my family's here.

42:52.699 --> 42:54.699
I just can't call the cops.

42:54.701 --> 42:56.001
I ain't no snitch.

42:57.404 --> 42:59.139
I'm just here like a sitting
duck.

43:03.676 --> 43:05.309
Just my fucking luck.

43:05.311 --> 43:07.311
I ditch the getaway car
and I get pulled over

43:07.313 --> 43:09.147
in this fucking Camaro.

43:09.149 --> 43:12.283
Chasing down this damn tow
truck looking for the money.

43:12.285 --> 43:15.119
Clavo's pissed at me, the DA is
after me.

43:15.121 --> 43:16.956
What the fuck else is next?

43:18.359 --> 43:19.725
Harvey, my man.

43:19.727 --> 43:21.462
What's up, Morgan?

43:22.563 --> 43:23.595
This the day job?

43:23.597 --> 43:24.630
Ah, you know.

43:24.632 --> 43:26.331
I got the info for you.

43:26.333 --> 43:27.602
Let's see what you
got.

43:28.737 --> 43:31.405
There's this guy you been
talking about.

43:32.407 --> 43:33.506
I score from the guy all the
time,

43:33.508 --> 43:34.509
he fucks with Clavo.

43:37.245 --> 43:38.413
I always come through.

43:39.614 --> 43:41.448
20 bucks?

43:41.450 --> 43:44.350
What the fuck am I gonna do with
20 bucks?

43:44.352 --> 43:45.987
You know all that meth
you've been pushing?

43:47.422 --> 43:49.523
You're lucky I don't
arrest your ass right now.

43:49.525 --> 43:53.561
20 bucks is cool man, I
was just kidding.

43:53.563 --> 43:56.530
Take that 20 bucks and join a
gym.

43:56.532 --> 44:00.100
I'll get all buff like you,
Morgan.

44:00.102 --> 44:01.204
Fucking Thor.

44:02.238 --> 44:04.438
Well we found the
suspect in the front room

44:04.440 --> 44:05.406
and he was shot.

44:05.408 --> 44:07.508
We let him go so he can go to
the hospital

44:07.510 --> 44:09.176
so I guess we'll have to
go to the hospital to get

44:09.178 --> 44:10.712
more answers out of him.

44:10.714 --> 44:12.279
What's the status on him?

44:12.281 --> 44:13.113
Did he make it?

44:13.115 --> 44:14.014
Yeah we think he's gonna make
it.

44:14.016 --> 44:16.150
You know he was shot in the
chest once

44:16.152 --> 44:18.255
but it didn't pierce any vital
organs, so.

44:28.600 --> 44:30.131
That is just nasty.

44:30.133 --> 44:31.603
Yeah, real nasty.

44:33.237 --> 44:34.270
Look at the wall.

44:34.272 --> 44:35.771
I mean you've got to be.

44:35.773 --> 44:38.508
If I had a blacklight, this
would be glowing up right now.

44:38.510 --> 44:39.475
Yeah.

44:39.477 --> 44:41.677
You gotta be evil to
do some shit like this.

44:41.679 --> 44:44.380
So what information do
you have on this for me?

44:44.382 --> 44:47.618
Well, William has all
the information you need.

44:47.620 --> 44:50.086
He can debrief you when we
get back to the station.

44:50.088 --> 44:52.589
Yeah, I think I've just
about smelled enough of this.

44:52.591 --> 44:54.460
Let's get out of here.

45:36.136 --> 45:40.141
That's what happens when
you fuck with my money.

46:04.466 --> 46:06.869
What's up now, motherfucker?

46:12.642 --> 46:14.744
Hey, y'all get back to work

46:15.778 --> 46:16.644
Hey Fabo.

46:16.646 --> 46:17.578

46:17.580 --> 46:18.579
The car let you out when

Oh yeah.

46:22.752 --> 46:23.618

46:23.620 --> 46:25.353

47:06.899 --> 47:09.332
You know, you're a real good
worker.

47:09.334 --> 47:11.334
Let me add that I
appreciate what you bring

47:11.336 --> 47:12.403
to the table.

47:12.405 --> 47:14.338
But you're fucking up.

47:14.340 --> 47:15.773
This a business that we're
running here

47:15.775 --> 47:17.541
and what am I supposed to tell
them,

47:17.543 --> 47:20.844
that we can't paint
their cars, we backed up.

47:20.846 --> 47:22.379
Do whatever though.

47:22.381 --> 47:24.015
They gonna take their
business elsewhere.

47:24.017 --> 47:26.517
Don't panic too much,
we got a little time.

47:26.519 --> 47:27.788
But this serious though.

47:30.423 --> 47:31.288
You gotta kill it while it's a
snack

47:31.290 --> 47:33.360
before it turn into a meal, you
know.

47:34.728 --> 47:36.229
Let's go on and get this money,
man.

47:40.701 --> 47:41.599
I'm down.

47:41.601 --> 47:42.469
I'm down.

47:43.503 --> 47:44.371
I'm hit!

48:32.622 --> 48:34.489
I'm about to save the hood,
baby.

48:34.491 --> 48:36.824
Hey pop, hey.

48:36.826 --> 48:38.025
I'm about to save the hood.

48:38.027 --> 48:39.327
Bomb light though.

48:39.329 --> 48:40.328
Come through.

48:40.330 --> 48:42.330
Hey, you gonna be all
you can be, you feel me?

48:42.332 --> 48:45.466
Say man, what made
you wanna join the army?

48:45.468 --> 48:46.400
Gotta get out the hood huh?

48:46.402 --> 48:47.069
Oh yeah.

48:47.071 --> 48:48.402
Man.

48:48.404 --> 48:49.538
Nothing nice in these streets.

48:49.540 --> 48:50.606
The way you and pops, man,

48:50.608 --> 48:51.940
the way you all niggas did it,

48:51.942 --> 48:53.408

48:53.410 --> 48:55.844
shit man, I'm just trying to
change it in.

48:55.846 --> 48:56.912
I feel you, I feel you.

48:56.914 --> 48:57.746
You wanna see something new.

48:57.748 --> 48:59.715
Yeah man, gotta get
out.

48:59.717 --> 49:00.382
It's all good and everything

49:00.384 --> 49:01.717
but how your brother doing?

49:01.719 --> 49:03.454
Where your brother at though?

49:34.387 --> 49:35.853
Hey, where's Clavo?!

49:35.855 --> 49:37.388
Can I help you bro?

49:42.628 --> 49:43.763
Fuck you want?

49:49.069 --> 49:50.735
Where's Clavo,
you tell me where he is

49:50.737 --> 49:52.406
and I let you live!

49:59.847 --> 50:00.846
Fuck all you!

50:00.848 --> 50:04.683
Don't make
this hard on yourself!

50:06.587 --> 50:07.789
Call him out!

50:32.448 --> 50:34.114
Fuck out of here!

51:58.104 --> 52:00.040
Who the fuck is that?

52:10.818 --> 52:11.750
What's happening?

52:11.752 --> 52:12.452
You got some business or
something for me?

52:12.454 --> 52:14.186
Can I help you with something?

52:14.188 --> 52:16.588
I'm looking for a
young esse with tattoos.

52:16.590 --> 52:17.656
Young esse with tattoos?

52:17.658 --> 52:18.724
Goes by the name of Fabian.

52:18.726 --> 52:20.726
I don't hide no kids or
none of that shit, man.

52:20.728 --> 52:23.162
We straight about paint
and bodywork, that's it.

52:23.164 --> 52:26.032
I don't know nothing
about that other shit.

52:26.034 --> 52:27.266
Just straight business over
here.

52:27.268 --> 52:29.035
I don't know nothing about that.

52:29.037 --> 52:30.138
You sure about that?

52:37.979 --> 52:39.581
We'll see.

54:10.844 --> 54:11.843
Sit, motherfucker!

54:11.845 --> 54:12.544
Drop your ass.

54:12.546 --> 54:14.112
Sit your ass down, get down!

54:14.114 --> 54:15.246
Right now!

54:15.248 --> 54:15.947
You're gonna tell me everything

54:15.949 --> 54:17.815
I motherfucking need to know.

54:17.817 --> 54:18.685
Right now.

54:21.021 --> 54:22.421
I got the info I needed

54:22.423 --> 54:24.624
and it all points to a guy named
Fabian.

54:26.060 --> 54:27.928
If I find him, I find Clavo.

54:29.463 --> 54:30.331
Come on Sherri.

54:32.933 --> 54:34.668
What do we got here?

54:35.437 --> 54:38.036
We got the Torres gang
warehouses getting killed.

54:38.038 --> 54:40.939
These aren't just regular
warehouses, all right?

54:40.941 --> 54:42.408
These are the main focus points

54:42.410 --> 54:45.278
of the Torres Cartel hit.

54:45.280 --> 54:48.948
People beaten, left alive,
barely.

54:48.950 --> 54:51.017
We got the Ramirez residence,
again,

54:51.019 --> 54:52.252
a Torres Cartel.

54:52.254 --> 54:54.020
Are you telling me
that they're organized,

54:54.022 --> 54:56.290
that this is maybe a rival gang?

54:56.292 --> 54:58.459
Maybe the same person
and maybe the same people.

54:58.461 --> 55:00.727
The shit was tactical.

55:00.729 --> 55:05.034
All I know that it was cool,
it was calm, collected.

55:06.502 --> 55:08.202
With pinpoint accuracy.

55:08.204 --> 55:10.873
No drugs, no money.

55:11.774 --> 55:12.675
No murders.

55:13.743 --> 55:15.843
All I know that they were
looking for something,

55:15.845 --> 55:18.946
collecting information, hunting.

55:18.948 --> 55:20.215
For what?

55:20.217 --> 55:21.084
Or who.

55:23.487 --> 55:25.053
Man it's that dude, man!

55:25.055 --> 55:26.855
Dustin, come here.

55:26.857 --> 55:28.223
There's a bag in the back.

55:28.225 --> 55:30.358
Whatever you do, hide the bag.

55:30.360 --> 55:31.359
I trust you.

55:31.361 --> 55:32.294
I got you, bro.

55:32.296 --> 55:33.462
Lay in the bag, man.

55:33.464 --> 55:35.899
You hear me?

55:45.043 --> 55:47.376
hand over the bag.

55:47.378 --> 55:49.378
You looking for me,

56:02.894 --> 56:03.694
What is it, Sherri?

56:03.696 --> 56:05.362
What'd you call me down here
for?

56:05.364 --> 56:08.298
Morgan, I really fucked up.

56:08.300 --> 56:10.568
Everybody fucks up.

56:10.570 --> 56:12.069
What, they kick you out the case
too?

56:12.071 --> 56:15.207
No, I'm in trouble, I fucked
up.

56:17.176 --> 56:18.343
What is it?

56:18.345 --> 56:20.978
Look, I think I know who's
behind the home invasions

56:20.980 --> 56:23.147
and the warehouse busts.

56:23.149 --> 56:24.282
Oh my god, oh my god.

56:24.284 --> 56:25.151
And?

56:26.219 --> 56:27.318
It's a friend.

56:27.320 --> 56:29.220
His name is Timothy.

56:29.222 --> 56:32.390
And actually, he's a brother
of one of the victims

56:32.392 --> 56:33.492
from the 45

56:33.494 --> 56:34.192
- South crime scene.
- Fuck.

56:34.194 --> 56:35.927
You need to tell me everything.

56:35.929 --> 56:37.363
You know I can help you.

56:37.365 --> 56:39.431
Okay.

56:39.433 --> 56:40.432
He's a childhood friend.

56:40.434 --> 56:43.402
And I may have slipped
and told him something

56:43.404 --> 56:45.204
I shouldn't have, but he is a
really,

56:45.206 --> 56:47.072
really good person.

56:47.074 --> 56:48.274
Oh my god, oh my god.

56:48.276 --> 56:51.110
Oh my god, my career's gonna be
over!

56:51.112 --> 56:52.177
Where you going?

56:52.179 --> 56:53.580
What am I gonna
do, what am I gonna do?

56:53.582 --> 56:55.848
Sherri, get over here!

56:58.587 --> 57:00.553
Where is he?

57:00.555 --> 57:01.755
Where is he?

57:01.757 --> 57:07.095
He's at the hotel on 35
and Walnut Hill.

57:18.207 --> 57:19.074
Fuck!

57:49.973 --> 57:53.543
Come on, motherfucker.

58:12.097 --> 58:13.466
Can't believe
this shit was a setup

58:14.400 --> 58:16.234
by Lorenzo and his cousin Clavo.

58:17.403 --> 58:20.237
Good thing I split the
bag to buy me some time.

58:20.239 --> 58:21.705
But ain't no telling how much.

58:21.707 --> 58:23.476
All this shit for some extra
cash.

58:26.679 --> 58:28.278
Where's
Fabian and who are you?

58:28.280 --> 58:29.480
I know you got something
to do with this shit.

58:29.482 --> 58:31.716
Bro, I got nothing to do with
this shit.

58:31.718 --> 58:33.485
Shut up, get down!

58:33.487 --> 58:34.354
Get down!

58:36.556 --> 58:38.155
Who the fuck are you?

58:38.157 --> 58:39.491
Who are you, stop!

58:39.493 --> 58:40.692
Stop, put the gun down.

58:40.694 --> 58:41.559
No, put your gun
down.

58:41.561 --> 58:42.560
Put the gun down, DEA.

58:42.562 --> 58:43.995
You're interfering in a
Federal investigation.

58:43.997 --> 58:45.597
Put it down, get on you knees.

58:45.599 --> 58:46.598
Put the gun down.

58:46.600 --> 58:47.298
Put it down.

58:47.300 --> 58:49.200
I swear, I'll shoot your ass.

58:49.202 --> 58:51.269
Listen, there's bigger
things going on here

58:51.271 --> 58:54.005
than me or you, but
you gotta listen to me.

58:54.007 --> 58:55.508
There's something bigger going
on here.

58:55.510 --> 58:57.041
It's bigger than the both of us.

58:57.043 --> 58:58.143
Now you're military, right?

58:58.145 --> 58:58.977
Yeah.

58:58.979 --> 59:00.112
What the fuck that got to do
with it?

59:00.114 --> 59:02.415
Listen, I've been on you
all the way down 45 South

59:02.417 --> 59:04.085
and I know a lot about you, son.

59:06.154 --> 59:07.721
There's some people you want to
get to

59:07.723 --> 59:10.022
and I can help you get there.

59:10.024 --> 59:12.324
Now listen first, I
need to know something.

59:12.326 --> 59:15.060
Before I call this in, do you
have a bag?

59:15.062 --> 59:15.729
I got a bag.

59:15.731 --> 59:16.563
All of it?

59:16.565 --> 59:17.664
Nah, I just got
half.

59:17.666 --> 59:20.001
Shit, the Cartel got it.

59:23.205 --> 59:24.237
They said he go killed a guy.

59:24.239 --> 59:25.405
They kidnapped him.

59:25.407 --> 59:26.473
That's my friend
Fabian.

59:26.475 --> 59:27.641
Yo, shut the fuck up.

59:27.643 --> 59:30.177
Calm down, we'll figure this
out.

59:30.179 --> 59:32.147
Just listen to me, hear me out.

59:37.387 --> 59:40.154
Clavo has a farm right
off the border of Mexico.

59:40.156 --> 59:41.355
That's where we'll go.

59:41.357 --> 59:43.791
Right now he thinks we're
gonna make a deal in two days.

59:43.793 --> 59:45.393
But we're gonna ambush him in
one.

59:45.395 --> 59:46.627
Listen up.

59:46.629 --> 59:48.463
If you want to have any chance
of getting your friend back.

59:48.465 --> 59:51.432
Our getaway vehicle is
gonna be on the south side

59:51.434 --> 59:52.634
near the stream.

59:52.636 --> 59:54.736
Now we're gonna split up into
two teams.

59:54.738 --> 59:57.171
We're gonna need a group
of trustworthy guys.

59:57.173 --> 59:59.374
I'm gonna have to fly
under the radar on this one

59:59.376 --> 01:00:01.109
so that means no backup.

01:00:01.111 --> 01:00:02.211
So do you have a group of guys?

01:00:02.213 --> 01:00:03.447
Yeah, I got some guys.

01:00:04.482 --> 01:00:05.781
We enter from the south.

01:00:05.783 --> 01:00:07.483
I'm gonna take the stream.

01:00:07.485 --> 01:00:09.652
You're gonna take a couple
guys towards the horse stalls.

01:00:09.654 --> 01:00:11.654
That's where your friend's gonna
be.

01:00:11.656 --> 01:00:13.088
The bag's gonna be over here.

01:00:13.090 --> 01:00:16.292
Listen, we got seven, 10 minutes
tops

01:00:16.294 --> 01:00:17.827
before Clavo's men are all over
us.

01:00:17.829 --> 01:00:19.562
Then shit's gonna hit the fan.

01:00:19.564 --> 01:00:21.164
Can you do this?

01:00:21.166 --> 01:00:23.533
Yeah, let me ask you a
question.

01:00:23.535 --> 01:00:27.237
What if we get in here
and the money's not here

01:00:27.239 --> 01:00:28.672
and their friend ain't there?

01:00:28.674 --> 01:00:30.473
Listen.

01:00:30.475 --> 01:00:32.442
This is not a marriage of
convenience.

01:00:32.444 --> 01:00:33.611
We get in, we get out.

01:00:33.613 --> 01:00:35.746
If you're not back at the
getaway car when I'm there,

01:00:35.748 --> 01:00:37.381
I'm gone, buddy.

01:00:37.383 --> 01:00:39.084
And I'd expect the same from
you.

01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:42.286
Can you do this?

01:00:42.288 --> 01:00:43.821
I can do it.

01:00:43.823 --> 01:00:45.322
But this ain't a guarantee.

01:00:45.324 --> 01:00:47.157
Neither is life, buddy.

01:00:47.159 --> 01:00:48.727
Just roll with it.

01:00:48.729 --> 01:00:49.730
Let's lock and load.

01:00:52.231 --> 01:00:54.164
It's gonna be a long road.

01:00:54.166 --> 01:00:55.400
Take the night off.

01:00:55.402 --> 01:00:57.235
Do what you gotta do.

01:00:57.237 --> 01:00:59.473
We'll meet tomorrow
morning and go from there.

01:01:13.788 --> 01:01:15.855
What the fuck is that, man?

01:01:15.857 --> 01:01:19.124
I thought you was out of this
shit.

01:01:19.126 --> 01:01:19.794
I know.

01:01:21.496 --> 01:01:22.363
So what now?

01:01:24.299 --> 01:01:26.100
I'm gonna find that
motherfucker.

01:01:27.201 --> 01:01:28.269
And I'm gonna kill him.

01:01:29.705 --> 01:01:31.540
Nigger, you trying to go to
Mexico

01:01:32.875 --> 01:01:34.140
with them Cartel niggers?

01:01:34.142 --> 01:01:36.443
Man you out your goddamn mind.

01:01:36.445 --> 01:01:37.313
Hell no.

01:01:39.415 --> 01:01:41.183
I'm gonna need a
favor.

01:01:42.484 --> 01:01:45.586
You done ran out of
all your favors with me.

01:01:45.588 --> 01:01:48.923
But since you my nigger,
I'ma hold you down.

01:01:48.925 --> 01:01:50.594
I'ma hold you down.

01:02:05.742 --> 01:02:07.410
Get your ass out.

01:02:16.587 --> 01:02:19.421
You don't get two shots.

01:02:19.423 --> 01:02:20.923
We're gonna go in through the
south side,

01:02:20.925 --> 01:02:23.258
in the stream, just like we
talked about in the plan.

01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:24.460
We split off.

01:02:24.462 --> 01:02:26.662
Son, you're coming with me.

01:02:26.664 --> 01:02:29.431
You guys split off and go the
other way.

You know in life we gonna

But you gotta remain strong,
you know what I mean?

01:10:30.439 --> 01:10:34.174
And always pull through
and protect your family.

01:10:34.176 --> 01:10:36.176
I'm an American Soldier.

01:10:36.178 --> 01:10:39.249
I'm a warrior and a member of a
team.

01:10:43.286 --> 01:10:46.120
A warrior and a member of a
team.

01:10:46.122 --> 01:10:47.922
I will never quit.

01:10:49.092 --> 01:10:53.227
Never leave a fallen comrade.

01:11:19.823 --> 01:11:20.691
Help!

01:12:11.311 --> 01:12:12.877
I'll take care of my brother

01:12:12.879 --> 01:12:15.416
and I'll take care of my family.

01:12:17.951 --> 01:12:20.553
Dad, Jojo keep getting on my
nerves.

01:12:23.024 --> 01:12:25.925
Always pull through
and protect your family.

01:12:25.927 --> 01:12:27.126
Be there for them, you know.

01:12:27.128 --> 01:12:31.132
But at the end of the day don't
ever throw your life away.

01:12:32.934 --> 01:12:36.271
Okay, I'll take care
of them.

01:12:39.208 --> 01:12:42.242
Never throw your life
away.

01:12:46.148 --> 01:12:47.883
Protect your family.

01:12:50.219 --> 01:12:52.352
And I'll
never throw my life away.

01:13:23.087 --> 01:13:26.221
Hey dad, it's me
Morgan.

01:13:26.223 --> 01:13:28.223
By the time you read this
letter,

01:13:28.225 --> 01:13:30.192
I'll be well on my way to
prison.

01:13:30.194 --> 01:13:32.463
But I accept the
consequences of my actions.

01:13:33.498 --> 01:13:35.297
I guess you were right.

01:13:35.299 --> 01:13:37.933
I was a poor excuse for a
detective.

01:13:37.935 --> 01:13:40.137
And even worse, as a son.

01:13:41.139 --> 01:13:43.975
I wish it was me you lost
as a son and not Peter.

01:13:45.143 --> 01:13:47.344
But I could never take his
place.

01:13:47.346 --> 01:13:48.313
Not even in death.

01:13:49.614 --> 01:13:50.949
So take care, old man.

01:13:51.950 --> 01:13:54.685
Maybe one day we'll meet again.

01:13:54.687 --> 01:13:55.555
Morgan.

01:14:00.992 --> 01:14:01.860
Fabian!

01:14:03.062 --> 01:14:04.095

shit.

01:14:08.067 --> 01:14:08.933
Are you okay?

01:14:08.935 --> 01:14:10.637
That ain't even half of the
story.

01:14:12.038 --> 01:14:13.572
Well I'm happy to see you're
okay now.

01:14:13.574 --> 01:14:15.141

01:14:16.643 --> 01:14:18.310
