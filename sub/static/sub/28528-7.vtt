00:02.907 --> 00:04.867
<i>Previously,
on "</i> The Spanish Princess"...

00:04.869 --> 00:07.189
<i>Isabella
of Castile is dead.</i>

00:07.191 --> 00:10.833
<i>The new Spanish queen has been
blown off course to these shores.</i>

00:10.835 --> 00:13.636
Now she is queen,
my father says we cannot marry.

00:13.638 --> 00:15.318
Your father
will not pay the dowry.

00:15.320 --> 00:17.520
There is no marriage
you can make now.

00:17.522 --> 00:19.842
You're soiled,
have no dowry and no rank.

00:19.844 --> 00:23.086
You mock us for our efforts
to keep this throne for you.

00:23.088 --> 00:25.288
I will not
let him break me.

00:25.290 --> 00:29.092
The Spanish princess and Prince Arthur
performed their marriage duties.

00:29.094 --> 00:30.533
They knew each other.

00:30.535 --> 00:33.296
I will not be an instrument
of yours, My Lady.

00:33.298 --> 00:34.738
I remain a maid.

00:37.182 --> 00:40.063
I will sooner believe
in God than that.

00:40.065 --> 00:43.587
The baby
knew it wasn't wanted.

00:43.589 --> 00:47.351
I have made a marriage between
my son and Princess Mary.

00:47.353 --> 00:49.072
<i>No one tells
me what to do.</i>

00:49.074 --> 00:51.675
<i>We do not need
you, Catherine.</i>

02:12.600 --> 02:14.761
I will miss you, Rosa.

02:14.763 --> 02:16.765
Highness.

02:17.525 --> 02:19.525
I don't want to leave you,

02:19.527 --> 02:23.530
but I need to see my family,
and I know that I shamed you.

02:23.532 --> 02:24.971
Shh. Shh.

02:24.973 --> 02:26.613
I didn't mean
to be a burden to you.

02:26.615 --> 02:28.897
You have never
been a burden, Rosa.

02:29.858 --> 02:31.858
You are my friend.

02:31.860 --> 02:34.142
Señora...

02:35.224 --> 02:37.144
it is not too late.

02:37.146 --> 02:39.746
You could come with me
back to Spain,

02:39.748 --> 02:41.308
leave Lina here
with Oviedo,

02:41.310 --> 02:44.791
and we both go home
and start a new life.

02:44.793 --> 02:49.196
Highness, I implore you to
join us on the voyage back.

02:49.198 --> 02:52.359
I fear what fate awaits you
if you stay here now in England.

02:52.361 --> 02:54.401
Ambassador,
Spain and England

02:54.403 --> 02:56.884
may no longer need me
for the alliance,

02:56.886 --> 02:59.246
but Harry loves me.

02:59.248 --> 03:02.249
He told me he held fast
against them all.

03:02.251 --> 03:04.253
He will be true to me.

03:06.336 --> 03:08.338
Highness.

03:10.460 --> 03:12.462
Rosa...

03:13.223 --> 03:15.225
I want to give you
something.

03:16.266 --> 03:18.906
No. Señora, no...

03:18.908 --> 03:21.912
This compass helped Señor
Colombo to find his way.

03:23.233 --> 03:25.433
Perhaps it will
help you as well.

03:25.435 --> 03:26.795
It is yours.

03:26.797 --> 03:30.078
He gave this to you.
It is precious.

03:30.080 --> 03:31.760
So are you.

03:31.762 --> 03:34.244
Maybe it will bring you
back to us someday.

03:43.454 --> 03:46.257
Go well, dear Rosa.

03:54.745 --> 03:56.988
I am sorry I will miss
your wedding.

03:58.389 --> 04:00.591
Your bowman
is very beautiful.

04:02.513 --> 04:06.595
We will attend each
other at our weddings,

04:06.597 --> 04:09.561
but you will ever be
in our prayers.

04:25.697 --> 04:27.577
There's nothing, Mother.

04:27.579 --> 04:30.622
Every rabbit and even rats
are being caught and eaten.

04:32.544 --> 04:33.703
<i>Mother.</i>

04:38.791 --> 04:40.911
Watch your brother
and sister for me,

04:40.913 --> 04:43.555
and tell them I will bring
them something to eat.

05:40.374 --> 05:42.054
<i>"Dearest Father,</i>

05:42.056 --> 05:44.696
<i>my sister would usurp
my role in the alliance</i>

05:44.698 --> 05:47.701
<i>by betrothing her son Charles
to English Princess Mary.</i>

05:50.985 --> 05:53.385
<i>Impress upon her the value
of my wedding to Prince Harry</i>

05:53.387 --> 05:56.829
<i>in strengthening
her kingdom now.</i>

05:56.831 --> 06:00.394
<i>Have her send my dowry, and we
will have a double wedding."</i>

06:04.639 --> 06:07.600
<i>Princess Mary.</i>

06:07.602 --> 06:11.606
Well, now,
don't we look fine?

06:13.768 --> 06:16.771
Dido awaiting
her Aeneas.

06:18.373 --> 06:20.613
I was about your age
when I was wed,

06:20.615 --> 06:22.617
so there's
nothing to fear.

06:25.340 --> 06:26.940
Don't be profligate
with the trim.

06:26.942 --> 06:30.063
In Spain, they may treat
it as a gaudy spectacle,

06:30.065 --> 06:34.950
but in England, marriage is to serve
God, king, and country.

06:42.077 --> 06:44.400
<i>Quite a haul you've got
yourself there, Master Dudley.</i>

06:56.532 --> 06:57.531
Dudley.

06:57.533 --> 06:59.613
My Lady.

06:59.615 --> 07:03.457
I bring you the
contributions of Essex.

07:03.459 --> 07:05.459
People of Kent
proved more resistant,

07:05.461 --> 07:08.142
but their dues to the Crown
will flow. I promise.

07:08.144 --> 07:11.666
You look like a cat bringing
a dead mouse to its owner.

07:11.668 --> 07:14.471
Please don't make a parade
of treasury affairs.

07:23.760 --> 07:25.680
Oviedo.

07:25.682 --> 07:27.684
I would like
to see the king.

07:29.086 --> 07:33.608
I have orders to not
show you in, my lady.

07:33.610 --> 07:34.930
"My lady"?

07:34.932 --> 07:37.572
Oviedo,
she is "highness."

07:37.574 --> 07:38.934
<i>I'll take you.</i>

07:38.936 --> 07:41.136
I know the way,
Lord Stafford.

07:41.138 --> 07:42.698
I do not need
an escort.

07:42.700 --> 07:43.819
Well, I was your escort

07:43.821 --> 07:45.060
when you first
came to England,

07:45.062 --> 07:47.785
so why break the habit?

08:05.523 --> 08:07.883
I was told I could
see the king.

08:07.885 --> 08:09.565
The king?

08:09.567 --> 08:11.087
Do you suppose
he idles here?

08:11.089 --> 08:12.288
He has weddings
to arrange.

08:12.290 --> 08:13.689
Then I wish
to see Prince Harry.

08:13.691 --> 08:15.171
Prince Harry
is no longer here.

08:15.173 --> 08:17.613
He's gone to get ready

08:17.615 --> 08:19.615
for his wedding
to your niece,

08:19.617 --> 08:21.620
<i>Princess Eleanor.</i>

08:23.582 --> 08:26.062
Did your sister
not tell you?

08:26.064 --> 08:27.744
It was arranged
before she left.

08:27.746 --> 08:30.587
Harry will
not marry Eleanor.

08:30.589 --> 08:32.107
<i>No, he is
betrothed to me.</i>

08:32.110 --> 08:33.870
The king oversaw our
blessing by the bishop.

08:33.871 --> 08:36.873
Do not presume
to lecture me in the law.

08:36.875 --> 08:39.678
A bended knee
is not a contract.

08:41.080 --> 08:43.080
<i>The Prince of Wales
has repudiated you.</i>

08:43.082 --> 08:44.241
It isn't true.

08:44.243 --> 08:45.963
<i>He would
not abandon me.</i>

08:45.965 --> 08:48.765
Alas, my lady,
a young man's gaze

08:48.767 --> 08:53.731
can be inconstant,
fickle.

08:53.733 --> 08:57.056
Prince Harry is in Spain
for his wedding to your niece.

08:58.698 --> 09:00.417
<i>She's already fertile,</i>

09:00.419 --> 09:03.180
so she will bear him heirs
when the marriage is concluded.

09:03.182 --> 09:05.022
Prince Harry
and his sister, Mary,

09:05.024 --> 09:07.264
will double-stitch
our alliance with your country,

09:07.266 --> 09:09.106
<i>and you will have
no part in it.</i>

09:09.108 --> 09:10.668
Where is the king?

09:10.670 --> 09:13.911
My dear girl,
something you should learn...

09:13.913 --> 09:16.594
there is
a time for dignity,

09:16.596 --> 09:18.836
for admitting
one has lost

09:18.838 --> 09:21.241
and being gracious
in defeat.

09:22.762 --> 09:24.682
There's no place for you now
here in England.

09:24.684 --> 09:25.844
- I...
- No.

09:25.846 --> 09:28.849
Close that ruby mouth.

09:30.610 --> 09:32.613
The audience is over.

09:36.697 --> 09:39.578
If you care
for him at all,

09:39.580 --> 09:41.662
you'll set sail
for Spain.

09:43.664 --> 09:45.666
There's nothing
for you here.

09:56.837 --> 09:58.920
Lina de Cardonnes...

09:59.961 --> 10:03.124
I ask you
to be my wife.

10:09.811 --> 10:11.330
You may not wear it

10:11.332 --> 10:13.332
until I place it on your
finger at our wedding.

10:13.334 --> 10:15.777
Aww.

10:22.223 --> 10:23.983
How did you pay for this?

10:23.985 --> 10:26.786
I work
for Lady Margaret.

10:26.788 --> 10:29.629
But she is
Catherine's enemy.

10:29.631 --> 10:32.953
The only enemy
is hunger and be poor.

10:32.955 --> 10:34.874
This is the country
I was brought to.

10:34.876 --> 10:37.317
I did not ask to be here,
but I must make my life.

10:37.319 --> 10:38.758
But must you work
for her?

10:38.760 --> 10:40.763
Do you know another
who can pay me?

10:42.324 --> 10:45.047
I will be your husband,
and I will keep you.

10:47.049 --> 10:48.649
I am sorry
the Infanta cannot be

10:48.651 --> 10:50.370
the queen of England
as she dreams,

10:50.372 --> 10:53.253
but I must
make a life for us,

10:53.255 --> 10:58.661
and thanks to Allah and
the woman who pays me, I can.

11:01.063 --> 11:03.104
I did not mean to...

11:03.106 --> 11:07.788
Please, just don't tell the
Infanta who it is who pays you.

11:07.790 --> 11:09.792
It would hurt her.

11:13.396 --> 11:17.198
Oviedo, can you
take me to the king?

11:17.200 --> 11:19.040
Is he here?

11:19.042 --> 11:21.044
I must see him.

11:23.166 --> 11:27.929
You always served me
with kindness and compassion.

11:27.931 --> 11:29.933
Please do this for me.

11:30.934 --> 11:34.378
Last I know, the king
is in <i>la galeria.</i>

11:36.260 --> 11:38.262
<i>Os doy las gracias.</i>

11:44.949 --> 11:45.988
Your Grace.

11:45.990 --> 11:47.992
Catherine.

11:50.074 --> 11:52.835
Thank you for seeing me.

11:52.837 --> 11:55.319
I know this
cannot be easy for you.

11:58.082 --> 12:00.322
Harry is...

12:00.324 --> 12:01.443
He loves me.

12:01.445 --> 12:03.165
He cannot wed my niece.

12:03.167 --> 12:05.327
Harry has a new path
he must take.

12:05.329 --> 12:06.969
But does he
do so willingly?

12:06.971 --> 12:09.292
For peace and duty and
for king and for country,

12:09.294 --> 12:11.296
yes, I think he does.

12:12.096 --> 12:14.457
Much like his mother did
in marrying me.

12:14.459 --> 12:16.018
But you found love.

12:16.020 --> 12:18.141
You think Harry can
abandon his love for me?

12:18.143 --> 12:21.544
A king is
not like other men.

12:21.546 --> 12:24.347
His heart
belongs to his kingdom,

12:24.349 --> 12:27.831
and in that sacrifice he proves
that he will be a great monarch.

12:27.833 --> 12:31.837
Harry's ambition is to make
this isle master of the world.

12:33.839 --> 12:35.841
I have seen it in his eyes.

12:36.762 --> 12:39.044
Soon, we will all be
in his shadow.

12:41.366 --> 12:43.369
If it is his choice...

12:45.010 --> 12:47.012
then I accept it, but...

12:49.014 --> 12:51.897
But, please,
Your Grace...

12:53.299 --> 12:55.499
is he happy?

12:55.501 --> 12:58.222
You still care
for his happiness?

12:58.224 --> 13:00.226
I cannot help it.

13:01.988 --> 13:05.351
I love him,
so he has my heart.

13:07.353 --> 13:09.395
Sweet, constant Catherine.

13:13.039 --> 13:15.041
You were born
to be a queen.

13:15.922 --> 13:17.522
I am still
without a wife.

13:17.524 --> 13:19.524
I know I am not Harry,

13:19.526 --> 13:24.050
but you would yet be
Queen of England.

13:26.213 --> 13:28.855
You honor me,
Your Grace...

13:30.016 --> 13:31.856
but I cannot.

13:31.858 --> 13:35.022
You deserve the full
heart of a wife.

13:36.063 --> 13:39.064
Mine will ever be
for Harry.

13:39.066 --> 13:41.068
Yes.

13:42.349 --> 13:44.389
And mine
for my dear, sweet Lizzie.

13:46.393 --> 13:48.393
Who allowed you
to return?

13:48.395 --> 13:50.556
I agreed
to speak with her,

13:50.558 --> 13:53.240
but now she
will take her leave.

13:54.522 --> 13:55.921
Your Grace.

13:55.923 --> 13:57.363
Make sure she leaves
the palace grounds,

13:57.365 --> 13:58.924
and do not readmit her.

13:58.926 --> 14:00.928
Yes, my lady.

14:02.370 --> 14:04.372
Escort her...

14:06.013 --> 14:08.016
as a princess.

14:18.506 --> 14:21.027
I think her heart is broken.

14:21.029 --> 14:22.388
Good.

14:22.390 --> 14:24.591
She may send it to
her sister as a warning.

14:24.593 --> 14:26.352
<i>There's still no word</i>

14:26.354 --> 14:28.955
<i>on Edmund de la Pool's
return to us.</i>

14:28.957 --> 14:30.677
He'd best
be sent back soon,

14:30.679 --> 14:33.602
or perhaps we'll think again
about who our friends are.

14:34.563 --> 14:37.284
My sister
has betrayed me.

14:37.286 --> 14:40.127
Harry is to wed
her daughter, Eleanor.

14:40.129 --> 14:42.969
They say he's left
for Spain already.

14:42.971 --> 14:47.214
But, Highness, no ships have sailed
to Spain since your sister left.

14:47.216 --> 14:50.177
I know because
Rosa was asking.

14:50.179 --> 14:53.180
The merchant ship she
and the ambassador sailed on

14:53.182 --> 14:55.622
was the first one
in a month.

14:55.624 --> 14:57.424
The prince would
not have sailed on that.

14:57.426 --> 14:59.589
You think he's
still in England?

15:01.150 --> 15:03.030
Then I must find him.

15:03.032 --> 15:05.475
Until he tells me to my
face that he forsakes me...

15:06.476 --> 15:08.478
then I believe in him.

15:32.582 --> 15:36.186
You evoke the torments
of Christ in the wilderness.

15:37.227 --> 15:39.229
<i>You're troubled.</i>

15:40.230 --> 15:42.070
Harry, it becomes you
that you wish

15:42.072 --> 15:44.433
to hold your course
in matters of the heart.

15:44.435 --> 15:47.155
My father
has already told me

15:47.157 --> 15:52.441
of the double-stitched alliance that
Queen Joanna has demanded of us.

15:52.443 --> 15:56.045
She has a daughter whom
she wishes to see wed well,

15:56.047 --> 15:59.088
and what better husband
could there be in Christendom?

15:59.090 --> 16:01.330
I have prayed
on king and country,

16:01.332 --> 16:04.053
peace and duty,
as I was tasked to do.

16:04.055 --> 16:06.575
A king must choose
his reason and his strength

16:06.577 --> 16:10.742
to choose a path which is
right for England's future.

16:12.183 --> 16:14.185
What of Catherine?

16:14.506 --> 16:16.145
Where is she in this?

16:16.147 --> 16:18.149
She'll return to Spain.

16:19.711 --> 16:22.233
She's comely.
She'll find another suitor.

16:23.275 --> 16:25.114
<i>Her sister
will help her,</i>

16:25.116 --> 16:27.517
and I think you'll find her
heart recovers quickly

16:27.519 --> 16:29.561
at the sight
of Spanish gold.

16:31.083 --> 16:33.203
Without
this second match,

16:33.205 --> 16:35.405
the whole alliance
could be forfeit.

16:35.407 --> 16:37.449
I will tell you
when I have decided.

16:40.452 --> 16:42.775
And I will pray on it further.

17:07.440 --> 17:09.440
It's true, then.

17:09.442 --> 17:11.642
You are a Saracen.

17:11.644 --> 17:16.529
My Lady,
the word is "Muslim."

17:17.170 --> 17:18.770
There is no law
against it here.

17:18.771 --> 17:22.333
Please, enlighten me.

17:22.335 --> 17:25.779
What is it that you do
here on this carpet?

17:27.741 --> 17:29.541
I pray to Allah.

17:29.543 --> 17:31.545
I surrender to His will.

17:32.185 --> 17:34.828
Devotion is commendable.

17:37.311 --> 17:39.313
Tell me...

17:40.434 --> 17:42.436
does your princess
know you're a heretic?

17:43.757 --> 17:47.479
I'm told you are
sweethearts with her lady.

17:47.481 --> 17:49.483
That is true.

17:49.884 --> 17:52.124
What information
have you for me?

17:52.126 --> 17:54.166
Who plots
against the king?

17:54.168 --> 17:55.567
No one at the court,
My Lady.

17:55.569 --> 17:57.571
You're sure?

17:59.213 --> 18:00.813
Send someone to the ports,

18:00.815 --> 18:04.336
<i>and read every letter
coming in and out of court.</i>

18:04.338 --> 18:06.579
The York traitors
still have friends here.

18:06.581 --> 18:08.583
We will root them out.

18:10.665 --> 18:13.746
And take this book of hours.

18:13.748 --> 18:16.189
Learn some Latin.

18:16.191 --> 18:18.831
Read the Catholic prayers
and psalms.

18:18.833 --> 18:21.554
I am not Queen Isabella.

18:21.556 --> 18:23.516
My wish is for you
to find the light

18:23.518 --> 18:25.560
without the need of torture.

18:28.323 --> 18:30.605
I pray the light finds you.

18:50.826 --> 18:53.467
Hey! Hey, he's stolen me onions!

18:54.710 --> 18:56.712
Watch out.

19:05.641 --> 19:07.643
Stay close.

19:11.888 --> 19:13.890
Come.

19:17.734 --> 19:19.736
<i>Stop right there.</i>

19:20.817 --> 19:22.216
- George.
- Cousin.

19:22.218 --> 19:23.378
<i>Let them pass.</i>

19:23.380 --> 19:25.742
In. In, in!

19:27.584 --> 19:28.823
Oh, forgive what happened.

19:28.825 --> 19:31.266
The streets
are wayward these days.

19:31.268 --> 19:35.430
Dear Maggie,
the whitest of white roses.

19:35.432 --> 19:36.871
My heart
is glad to...

19:36.873 --> 19:38.914
I wish you to take
my boys in, George,

19:38.916 --> 19:42.639
for a time. Our fortunes
are much changed.

19:54.612 --> 19:58.614
A rose of any color has thorns
and can still draw blood.

19:58.616 --> 20:00.215
Why not
work with us?

20:00.217 --> 20:02.578
As injustice grows,
our numbers swell.

20:02.580 --> 20:05.301
There are many that
hate the Tudors now.

20:05.303 --> 20:07.305
No, cousin.

20:07.945 --> 20:09.745
<i>I came to ask
for your help,</i>

20:09.747 --> 20:11.587
<i>but will my children
be in danger here?</i>

20:11.589 --> 20:14.951
Reggie cannot stay.
He is too young.

20:14.953 --> 20:16.472
If you cannot feed him,

20:16.474 --> 20:18.554
then perhaps the monks
at Sheen Priory.

20:18.556 --> 20:21.317
Sheen Priory
is a silent order.

20:21.319 --> 20:23.640
They speak
only on feast days.

20:23.642 --> 20:26.362
<i>No, I-I will find
another plan for Reggie.</i>

20:26.364 --> 20:29.566
Perhaps my fortunes
will reverse.

20:29.568 --> 20:31.167
They have to.

20:31.169 --> 20:34.531
Our fortunes never turn
under this pretender king.

20:34.533 --> 20:37.334
If you would pledge your
fealty to our York heir,

20:37.336 --> 20:40.257
De la Pool,
and support his claim,

20:40.259 --> 20:42.659
you would rally half
of England to his banner

20:42.661 --> 20:44.781
and the sooner
this thing would end.

20:44.783 --> 20:47.826
And the sooner all my children
would be in the ground.

20:49.828 --> 20:52.549
Do not let Henry
come to any harm.

20:52.551 --> 20:54.631
If one drop
of his blood spills,

20:54.633 --> 20:56.996
I will kill you
with my own bare hands.

20:59.879 --> 21:02.279
I asked
some English ladies,

21:02.281 --> 21:03.881
and we have to post
our banns

21:03.883 --> 21:05.643
for three weeks
before we marry.

21:05.645 --> 21:07.845
The Muslim way is we
announce at our <i>walima</i> feast,

21:07.847 --> 21:09.687
and then we marry
anywhere we wish.

21:09.689 --> 21:12.450
I did not know you
want a Muslim wedding.

21:12.452 --> 21:13.971
I am Muslim.

21:13.973 --> 21:15.253
I am Catholic.

21:15.255 --> 21:17.295
Only because
your father was afraid.

21:17.297 --> 21:20.578
My father was a convert
to the Catholic faith,

21:20.580 --> 21:22.660
but if we are
to marry in England,

21:22.662 --> 21:24.664
it must be Christian.

21:27.427 --> 21:30.028
So I am to deny my faith
and lie about who pays me,

21:30.030 --> 21:32.630
but you feel free to ask
me where the prince is

21:32.632 --> 21:34.232
and to tell the secrets
of the court

21:34.234 --> 21:36.474
because your princess
wants to know?

21:36.476 --> 21:37.956
<i>Do you love me
the most or her?</i>

21:37.958 --> 21:39.878
I am not sure.

21:39.880 --> 21:41.880
You should be.

21:41.882 --> 21:43.722
I sacrifice for you,

21:43.724 --> 21:46.405
just as you
sacrifice for me.

21:46.407 --> 21:48.567
And if I ask you
where the prince is,

21:48.569 --> 21:50.729
I am asking
for my own sake,

21:50.731 --> 21:52.531
because my happiness

21:52.533 --> 21:54.895
is soured
by her distress.

21:57.378 --> 21:59.778
I must leave
for some business.

21:59.780 --> 22:01.782
I will be back by tonight.

22:04.025 --> 22:06.027
Perhaps...

22:06.347 --> 22:08.067
we marry in a church,

22:08.069 --> 22:10.431
then have a Muslim feast?

22:27.769 --> 22:29.649
<i>So where is Harry?</i>

22:29.651 --> 22:34.694
All Oviedo knows is that
the prince is not at court.

22:34.696 --> 22:37.457
He and Charlie Brandon
left in secret.

22:37.459 --> 22:39.499
But he
is still in England?

22:39.501 --> 22:40.700
He does not know.

22:40.702 --> 22:41.982
Well, summon him
back here.

22:41.984 --> 22:43.103
I will talk with him.

22:43.105 --> 22:45.585
Señora, he has alread...

22:45.587 --> 22:47.589
Someone else must know.

22:56.679 --> 22:58.681
- <i>Stand back.</i>
- Hello.

22:59.081 --> 23:01.482
What's your name?

23:01.484 --> 23:02.723
Anne.

23:02.725 --> 23:04.565
Anne, did you see
the prince today,

23:04.567 --> 23:06.727
Prince Harry?

23:06.729 --> 23:08.049
He's gone.

23:08.051 --> 23:10.173
Gone? Gone where?

23:11.574 --> 23:12.573
Anne, do you know?

23:12.575 --> 23:14.577
<i>Highness.</i>

23:16.779 --> 23:19.660
Catherine,
I mean you no offense,

23:19.662 --> 23:22.984
but your time at court,
it's behind you.

23:22.986 --> 23:24.826
I wish to see
the Prince of Wales.

23:24.828 --> 23:26.067
The prince is gone.

23:26.069 --> 23:27.869
He will be married.

23:27.871 --> 23:29.631
His life is
not your business,

23:29.633 --> 23:31.873
and nor is
any matter of the court.

23:31.875 --> 23:33.835
The longer you stay here,

23:33.837 --> 23:36.478
the more
you will demean yourself.

23:36.480 --> 23:38.482
Return to Spain,
I beg of you.

23:39.363 --> 23:41.365
Give up this folly.

23:44.128 --> 23:46.288
<i>How dare
he speak to me like that?</i>

23:46.290 --> 23:48.170
I am a princess.

23:48.172 --> 23:50.132
Who is he?
He is no one...

23:59.543 --> 24:00.943
Lady Catherine.

24:00.945 --> 24:02.745
Mr. Dudley.

24:02.747 --> 24:05.630
Sad to say,
your rent is overdue.

24:09.754 --> 24:11.756
The rent
is paid already.

24:12.477 --> 24:15.518
We have
receipt of payment.

24:15.520 --> 24:16.959
See here.

24:16.961 --> 24:19.522
The rent is now
eight pounds a month.

24:19.524 --> 24:20.963
Eight pounds?

24:20.965 --> 24:23.046
No, it is one pound,
15 shillings.

24:23.048 --> 24:25.568
It has increased
from this month onwards.

24:25.570 --> 24:27.050
This is
Lady Margaret's doing.

24:27.052 --> 24:29.052
It's a decision
for the church.

24:29.054 --> 24:30.693
It is their property.

24:30.695 --> 24:31.935
We cannot pay this.

24:31.937 --> 24:33.496
It would take
all the gold we have.

24:33.498 --> 24:35.098
A thousand pities,
madam,

24:35.100 --> 24:37.983
but if the rent cannot be met,
then you must leave.

25:09.936 --> 25:12.056
<i>Catherine.</i>

25:12.058 --> 25:14.018
I'm sorry.

25:14.020 --> 25:16.941
We have
nowhere else to go.

25:16.943 --> 25:18.945
Neither,
it seems, do I.

25:20.186 --> 25:23.267
You are welcome
for as long as we remain,

25:23.269 --> 25:26.753
<i>but, alas, I cannot
stay here for much longer.</i>

25:35.963 --> 25:39.604
My cousins
cannot help us.

25:39.606 --> 25:42.287
It seems our fortunes
match the others'.

25:42.289 --> 25:46.692
We both fall
at the Tudors' hands.

25:46.694 --> 25:48.976
I fear you
fall at mine...

25:50.097 --> 25:51.857
because I asked you

25:51.859 --> 25:54.820
to maintain my maidenhood
to Lady Margaret.

25:54.822 --> 25:58.303
I thought
of writing to her,

25:58.305 --> 26:00.628
telling her
you lay with Arthur...

26:03.271 --> 26:06.592
but I did not know
for a fact.

26:06.594 --> 26:11.399
And besides, who you did or did not
lie with is of little value now.

26:11.799 --> 26:13.799
Harry has gone
to marry Eleanor,

26:13.801 --> 26:15.922
as I'm sure you know.

26:15.924 --> 26:18.324
I would not give that crone
the satisfaction

26:18.326 --> 26:21.728
of me writing to her,
harming you,

26:21.730 --> 26:24.771
and then finding that she
disregards me anyway

26:24.773 --> 26:27.934
and my fortunes
are no more improved.

26:27.936 --> 26:31.019
What do they tell you
of the prince's wedding?

26:33.782 --> 26:37.063
Catherine, I speak
with a friendly heart,

26:37.065 --> 26:39.226
so I will speak plainly.

26:39.228 --> 26:42.028
You are without a home
in England,

26:42.030 --> 26:43.790
and when Harry
marries Eleanor,

26:43.792 --> 26:46.033
you are without
a husband, too.

26:46.035 --> 26:48.315
But if you return to Spain,

26:48.317 --> 26:50.998
you may live
as a princess again

26:51.000 --> 26:53.242
<i>and start
a new life there.</i>

26:56.245 --> 26:58.247
Tell me something.

27:00.169 --> 27:01.889
Why would Lady Margaret
tell the church

27:01.891 --> 27:04.894
to raise my rent right
now if she has won?

27:06.055 --> 27:08.376
<i>No, if Harry is
to marry Eleanor,</i>

27:08.378 --> 27:10.898
what threat could I be?

27:10.900 --> 27:14.061
Margaret Beaufort may simply
want to fatten the exchequer.

27:14.063 --> 27:16.264
She has raised the rents
of all of her tenants.

27:16.266 --> 27:21.151
We must accept that the world
has turned against us

27:21.831 --> 27:23.952
and there is no hope.

27:23.954 --> 27:28.396
When my mother's camp of tents
was burned down to the ground,

27:28.398 --> 27:30.278
she built
a camp of stone.

27:30.280 --> 27:32.280
Your mother had
an army at her back,

27:32.282 --> 27:33.842
a kingdom at her feet.

27:33.844 --> 27:35.764
You cannot even pay
your rent.

27:35.766 --> 27:38.166
Señor Colombo
once showed me a trick.

27:38.168 --> 27:42.250
When the sailors on his
ships faced a storm,

27:42.252 --> 27:43.772
they put
their hands together,

27:43.774 --> 27:45.374
and the tattoos
on their fingers

27:45.376 --> 27:47.135
made these two words...

27:47.137 --> 27:51.300
<i>"ya basta,"</i> hold fast.

27:51.302 --> 27:54.503
<i>It helped them reach
the New World.</i>

27:54.505 --> 27:57.146
I will reach
my new world, Maggie,

27:57.148 --> 27:59.230
and you must
reach yours, too.

28:00.952 --> 28:02.351
Chart a course.

28:02.353 --> 28:04.355
Head towards it.

28:17.368 --> 28:19.811
Thank you for letting
us share your room.

28:21.332 --> 28:23.335
What a beautiful dress.

28:24.936 --> 28:26.938
It is
for my wedding.

28:30.302 --> 28:32.304
Good night.

29:00.933 --> 29:04.897
<i>"Dearest Harry,
though I have not heard from you,</i>

29:06.179 --> 29:09.382
<i>I hold fast to my... our love.</i>

29:11.064 --> 29:14.105
<i>I believe that I
was born to love you</i>

29:14.107 --> 29:18.309
<i>as the sun exists to shine upon
the roses in the palace garden.</i>

29:18.311 --> 29:22.353
<i>You are my destiny,
and I will not forsake you.</i>

29:22.355 --> 29:26.399
<i>Come back to me,
wherever you may be."</i>

29:34.968 --> 29:36.970
Wherever.

29:52.266 --> 29:54.426
<i>Harry, my dearest prince,</i>

29:54.428 --> 29:57.069
<i>I'm in darkness
when I'm apart from you.</i>

29:57.071 --> 29:59.031
<i>I wilt upon the vine
of your absence,</i>

29:59.033 --> 30:00.512
<i>and my heart feels dry.</i>

30:00.514 --> 30:02.597
<i>Moments of time
are but an eternity.</i>

30:04.158 --> 30:06.240
<i>Harry. Harry. Harry.</i>

30:13.568 --> 30:15.848
Where have you been?

30:15.850 --> 30:17.970
<i>I need you.</i>

30:17.972 --> 30:19.974
I need you, too.

30:20.415 --> 30:22.417
Be with me.

30:28.143 --> 30:30.183
<i>No king's command,</i>

30:30.185 --> 30:32.427
<i>nothing can keep me
from you, Catherine.</i>

30:35.831 --> 30:37.833
<i>Only the crown.</i>

30:39.234 --> 30:41.436
For that,
I will toss love away.

30:42.958 --> 30:44.960
Harry?

30:45.881 --> 30:47.280
A king can play with love,

30:47.282 --> 30:49.605
but he cannot
build his reign on it.

30:51.967 --> 30:53.969
<i>Look.</i>

30:54.530 --> 30:57.091
<i>This is Princess Eleanor.</i>

30:57.093 --> 30:59.095
<i>She is my bride.</i>

30:59.935 --> 31:02.218
She will bear my sons...

31:04.220 --> 31:06.662
and I will build
my reign.

31:17.433 --> 31:19.956
You burned my letters...

31:21.918 --> 31:23.920
so I burned yours.

31:32.569 --> 31:35.330
Without you, I am lost.

31:35.332 --> 31:37.334
<i>Then you'll need this.</i>

32:19.057 --> 32:20.296
Is it from Harry?

32:20.298 --> 32:22.380
Your father.

32:31.389 --> 32:33.712
I have one final card
to play.

32:37.155 --> 32:39.276
<i>"To my daughter, Caterina,</i>

32:39.278 --> 32:41.478
<i>I write with news so sad</i>

32:41.480 --> 32:44.281
<i>that I can hardly bear
to tell of it.</i>

32:44.283 --> 32:46.403
<i>Your sister's husband, Philip,</i>

32:46.405 --> 32:48.405
<i>whom we all of us loved dearly,</i>

32:48.407 --> 32:51.128
<i>had the fever and is dead.</i>

32:51.130 --> 32:54.371
<i>Your sister's mind is weak
and full of fantasy,</i>

32:54.373 --> 32:56.213
<i>and she spread
the godless slander</i>

32:56.215 --> 32:58.736
<i>that his death
must be from poison at my hand,</i>

32:58.738 --> 33:03.020
<i>that I did it
to win power back in Spain.</i>

33:03.022 --> 33:06.464
<i>Joanna tried to rule alone,
but she is cracked with grief.</i>

33:06.466 --> 33:09.346
<i>She fell
to such a strange madness</i>

33:09.348 --> 33:13.110
<i>that I had to have her locked up
in the convent of Santa Clara,</i>

33:13.112 --> 33:16.594
<i>and I fear that she
will not regain her wits.</i>

33:16.596 --> 33:20.158
<i>The burden of the kingdom
falls to me,</i>

33:20.160 --> 33:24.242
<i>and I am now ruler
of the Spanish empire.</i>

33:24.244 --> 33:27.325
<i>Dear Caterina,
if anyone speaks ill of me,</i>

33:27.327 --> 33:31.449
<i>defend my honor,
and I will send your dowry."</i>

33:31.451 --> 33:34.652
Dowager princess,
you cannot be here.

33:34.654 --> 33:36.494
There are orders
to bar you...

33:36.496 --> 33:40.619
Chaplain Woolsey,
I would like to see the king.

33:40.621 --> 33:42.621
The privy council is
about to be in session.

33:42.623 --> 33:46.467
The Infanta has brought
urgent news from Spain.

33:47.788 --> 33:49.388
From Queen Joanna?

33:49.390 --> 33:51.350
There is no queen.

33:51.352 --> 33:53.712
<i>If you wonder why your enemy,
Edmund de la Pool,</i>

33:53.714 --> 33:57.636
is not returned to you,
then I have news.

34:03.084 --> 34:07.326
Your Grace, the dowager princess
brings an urgent message.

34:07.328 --> 34:08.647
No. Out.

34:08.649 --> 34:10.772
Now, let her speak.

34:17.338 --> 34:19.178
The queen's consort,

34:19.179 --> 34:22.504
Philip, Archduke of the House
of Habsburg, is dead.

34:24.105 --> 34:26.145
My sister's grief has
caused her health to fail,

34:26.147 --> 34:28.668
and her son and heir,
Prince Charles,

34:28.670 --> 34:31.311
who is betrothed
to your Princess Mary,

34:31.313 --> 34:34.514
is only eight and is
too young to rule.

34:34.516 --> 34:37.476
My father has declared himself
the king of Spain again,

34:37.478 --> 34:40.199
and I am named
ambassador to England.

34:40.202 --> 34:43.643
Ambassador? That is
a position for a man.

34:43.645 --> 34:46.646
I sat at my mother's feet
in the Alhambra palace.

34:46.648 --> 34:50.530
I listened to my father in the
golden Hall of the Ambassadors.

34:50.532 --> 34:52.693
Statecraft has always been
my family business.

34:52.695 --> 34:54.855
I see this
for what it is.

34:54.857 --> 34:57.498
You cannot block the
weddings we have brokered.

34:57.500 --> 34:59.340
My father can.

34:59.342 --> 35:01.502
My niece and nephew
are in his keeping now.

35:01.504 --> 35:03.464
Your father wants this
alliance as much as we do.

35:03.466 --> 35:05.628
Yet he offered me my dowry.

35:06.629 --> 35:08.469
<i>You were right, My Lady,</i>

35:08.471 --> 35:12.833
when you said my father
is as tricky as a fox,

35:12.835 --> 35:16.557
but you need him now to
save yourselves from France.

35:16.559 --> 35:19.280
<i>I am his proxy in this court,</i>

35:19.282 --> 35:21.202
so unless you wish
to cross him,

35:21.204 --> 35:25.807
I will take Señor de Fuensalida's
quarters for the moment,

35:25.809 --> 35:27.811
and my lady
will lodge with me.

35:28.692 --> 35:30.694
Hmm.

35:36.700 --> 35:38.702
But, Catherine...

35:39.423 --> 35:41.425
my son...

35:42.346 --> 35:45.227
I know you will
seek to find him,

35:45.229 --> 35:49.473
probably scour this
palace from top to toe.

35:50.194 --> 35:52.476
But he is gone.

35:56.680 --> 35:58.921
Your Grace.

35:58.923 --> 36:00.925
<i>Guards.</i>

36:02.887 --> 36:04.767
He will not stop
these marriages.

36:04.769 --> 36:07.770
This is a ruse
to stay at court.

36:07.772 --> 36:09.612
I know a schemer
when I see one,

36:09.614 --> 36:11.614
and I see a Spanish
schemer in a skirt.

36:11.616 --> 36:13.696
I will write again
to Maximilian.

36:13.698 --> 36:16.659
We must know if De la
Pool has been dispatched

36:16.661 --> 36:20.985
or if my enemy has found a
new shelter under Ferdinand.

36:33.318 --> 36:35.398
Mother?

36:35.400 --> 36:37.442
We're going to have
to be very brave.

36:38.844 --> 36:40.964
We need to live apart
for a little while.

36:40.966 --> 36:45.571
But when I can find a way,
we'll be together again.

36:53.899 --> 36:56.740
Did you see him at court?

36:56.742 --> 37:00.824
He is gone, but I don't
believe he is in Spain.

37:00.826 --> 37:02.626
My father
would have told me.

37:02.628 --> 37:05.469
I have written to him,

37:05.471 --> 37:07.671
asking him to find another
match for Eleanor

37:07.673 --> 37:09.994
and to let me
have Prince Harry.

37:09.996 --> 37:11.916
I still have some time.

37:11.918 --> 37:14.360
But we do not.

37:16.563 --> 37:19.003
Maggie, do you know
where you will go?

37:19.005 --> 37:20.404
I...

37:20.406 --> 37:22.527
Let me speak to the king
on your behalf.

37:22.529 --> 37:24.248
He is not a cruel man.

37:24.250 --> 37:26.411
Perhaps he will accept
you back at court.

37:26.413 --> 37:28.413
They will not accept me.

37:28.415 --> 37:30.495
I have
no currency with them.

37:30.497 --> 37:32.337
Catherine, you were right.

37:32.339 --> 37:34.701
I need to find
my own New World.

37:36.583 --> 37:38.585
Lady Pole...

37:39.907 --> 37:41.386
<i>it is very little,</i>

37:41.388 --> 37:42.467
<i>but it will buy food.</i>

37:42.469 --> 37:45.991
Please, take this...

37:45.993 --> 37:47.873
from us.

37:47.875 --> 37:49.434
No.

37:49.436 --> 37:51.717
Let us do you
this small kindness

37:51.719 --> 37:54.802
in memory of our
beloved Arthur.

37:57.605 --> 38:00.846
How different the world
would have been had he lived,

38:00.848 --> 38:04.532
for England,
for all of us.

38:09.377 --> 38:11.817
May I ask one more favor?

38:11.819 --> 38:14.702
May I borrow paper and ink?

38:25.433 --> 38:26.913
Up! There we go.

38:27.916 --> 38:29.918
Please don't touch.

38:32.040 --> 38:34.042
Bird and the bath
go to the king.

38:42.891 --> 38:46.853
Now, you can't speak
a word in here,

38:46.855 --> 38:49.456
because it's a special
kind of church.

38:49.458 --> 38:53.660
It's a quiet church,
but at night,

38:53.662 --> 38:56.944
you can whisper to
your little poppet, see?

38:56.946 --> 38:58.906
Poppet knows
how to keep quiet,

38:58.908 --> 39:00.950
and he'll keep
all your secrets safe.

39:02.632 --> 39:04.672
No, no, please.

39:04.674 --> 39:09.477
Reggie, I'll find a way
to bring you back.

39:09.479 --> 39:11.519
And we'll be back together
before you know it.

39:11.521 --> 39:14.041
Please, Mummy.
I'll be good. I promise.

39:14.043 --> 39:16.003
We'll be just
across the river

39:16.005 --> 39:18.005
at Syon Abbey
with the nuns.

39:18.007 --> 39:21.129
We're so close, we can
see the chimneys here.

39:21.131 --> 39:23.531
And we'll visit you
on feast days,

39:23.533 --> 39:26.414
and... and...

39:26.416 --> 39:29.137
Is this because of Daddy?

39:29.139 --> 39:32.460
'Cause it's my fault
Daddy died?

39:32.462 --> 39:35.143
No, my dearest boy.

39:36.787 --> 39:38.947
Never say that.

39:38.949 --> 39:42.110
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

39:42.112 --> 39:44.715
Mummy loves you
with all of her heart.

39:48.158 --> 39:50.481
I promise we'll return.

39:57.688 --> 40:00.491
Please, Mummy, please.

40:11.502 --> 40:12.782
I don't want Poppet.

40:12.784 --> 40:14.786
I want you.

40:20.031 --> 40:22.073
I'll bring it
for you next time.

40:27.479 --> 40:30.682
God grant me time
to see all the Tudors dead.

40:39.211 --> 40:40.210
George.

40:40.212 --> 40:41.811
Mother.

40:41.813 --> 40:42.812
Ursula.

40:42.814 --> 40:44.817
<i>Henry.</i>

40:45.818 --> 40:47.217
<i>I do not come
for charity.</i>

40:47.219 --> 40:49.860
Ursula and I
are staying in a nunnery.

40:49.862 --> 40:51.581
I am sorry.

40:51.583 --> 40:53.624
I have written
to my cousin Edmund.

40:53.626 --> 40:56.987
I have pledged my full support
in ending England's tyranny.

40:56.989 --> 41:00.150
We will destroy the Tudors,
send them all to Hell,

41:00.152 --> 41:03.754
and restore the true
and glorious house of York.

41:03.756 --> 41:06.757
I will stand with you
and do whatever it may take.

41:06.759 --> 41:09.079
I will cut
their throats myself,

41:09.081 --> 41:12.004
every man, woman,
and bastard son.

41:26.820 --> 41:28.940
I will help you dress.

41:28.942 --> 41:31.625
I can dress myself
now, Lina.

41:33.987 --> 41:35.987
<i>Your first duty as ambassador</i>

41:35.989 --> 41:40.712
will be to oversee Princess Mary's
betrothal ceremony to Charles.

41:40.714 --> 41:42.834
That is not within
an ambassador's remit.

41:42.836 --> 41:44.476
<i>Someone must translate,</i>

41:44.478 --> 41:47.639
and perhaps your overseeing it
will aid your acceptance

41:47.641 --> 41:49.921
that the alliance
is being made without you.

41:49.923 --> 41:52.284
Hmm, bended knee
is not a marriage.

41:52.286 --> 41:54.246
You said so yourself.

41:54.248 --> 41:56.608
My father could still
change his mind

41:56.610 --> 41:58.610
before Princess Mary
weds in law,

41:58.612 --> 42:00.853
and Harry
is not yet in Spain,

42:00.855 --> 42:02.895
<i>so he is not yet
married, either.</i>

42:02.897 --> 42:05.257
Prince Harry's whereabouts
is not your province.

42:05.259 --> 42:07.620
The king and myself
are both

42:07.622 --> 42:10.142
great-great-grandchildren
of John of Gaunt,

42:10.144 --> 42:13.786
our royal ancestor who
bequeathed us the throne,

42:13.788 --> 42:15.828
whereas you, My Lady,

42:15.830 --> 42:18.070
are John of Gaunt's
great-grandchild.

42:18.072 --> 42:20.673
You have a stronger claim
to the English throne

42:20.675 --> 42:23.676
than either
your son or grandson.

42:23.678 --> 42:27.000
If only women were allowed to rule
here, as in Spain.

42:27.002 --> 42:28.721
That is treason.

42:28.723 --> 42:34.127
I only observe that given
your intellect and ambition,

42:34.129 --> 42:36.009
were it
not for your sex,

42:36.011 --> 42:38.013
you could have been the
greatest queen of England.

42:48.183 --> 42:52.906
<i>You know what you must
do, so go quickly.</i>

42:52.908 --> 42:54.910
- Now go.
- Yes, sir.

42:57.953 --> 43:00.314
So you live again
at the palace.

43:00.316 --> 43:04.798
Your mistress torments
our Infanta for her sport.

43:04.800 --> 43:07.521
How can you do the bidding
of such a woman?

43:07.523 --> 43:11.485
You defend a woman whose
mother tormented our people,

43:11.487 --> 43:12.967
Moors and Jews.

43:12.969 --> 43:14.971
Isabella made...

43:16.012 --> 43:20.094
Lady Margaret
shows my faith respect.

43:20.096 --> 43:21.896
She would not see me
burn for my belief.

43:21.898 --> 43:24.338
Nor would Catherine,
as you know well.

43:24.340 --> 43:28.343
Why must we always
fight each other?

43:28.345 --> 43:30.305
Is this the way
that it will be?

43:30.307 --> 43:33.109
Must you really work
for Lady Margaret?

43:42.239 --> 43:45.160
I have received
a reply from my cousin.

43:45.162 --> 43:47.122
"The time
to strike is now.

43:47.124 --> 43:50.245
"Together, we will raise the
people and reclaim the kingdom.

43:50.247 --> 43:53.769
Your faithful cousin and rightful
king, Edmund de la Pool."

43:53.771 --> 43:56.411
There it is!

43:56.413 --> 43:58.416
Make ready, gentlemen.

44:00.217 --> 44:03.379
Do I see Edmund de la Pool
on English soil once more?

44:03.381 --> 44:06.262
Yes, you do,
and I bring God's wrath

44:06.264 --> 44:09.387
and the Yorks down
upon Henry bloody Tudor.

44:11.789 --> 44:13.791
Come.

44:32.090 --> 44:33.810
<i>The ale must be served</i>

44:33.812 --> 44:36.212
as soon as Princess Mary
stands after the ceremony.

44:36.214 --> 44:38.815
Half cups, that is decent.

44:38.817 --> 44:40.817
To the brim is not.

44:40.819 --> 44:44.781
It's a royal wedding,
not a tavern party.

44:44.783 --> 44:47.104
He says that there
are many coming to join us

44:47.106 --> 44:49.426
and that he will tell us
of the plan tonight.

44:49.428 --> 44:52.990
Do not use one thoroughfare
on the way to meet him.

44:52.992 --> 44:54.992
Ensure that you're
not followed.

44:54.994 --> 44:56.996
We must not
lead them to him.

45:15.295 --> 45:16.814
Will you
check inside?

45:16.816 --> 45:18.015
My Lady.

45:18.017 --> 45:19.297
Thank you.

45:19.299 --> 45:20.498
<i>My lady.</i>

45:20.500 --> 45:22.260
Good day,
Your Grace.

45:22.262 --> 45:23.661
<i>Our new ambassador</i>

45:23.663 --> 45:26.184
has done a marvelous job
with this wedding.

45:26.186 --> 45:28.987
She might consider dressing
more appropriately.

45:28.989 --> 45:31.351
Anyone would think
she's the bride.

45:40.200 --> 45:42.200
Oh, what in the name
of Christendom is she...

45:42.202 --> 45:44.402
Something troubles you,
Lady Margaret?

45:44.404 --> 45:46.805
My granddaughter
has vanished.

45:46.807 --> 45:48.046
I will look for her.

45:48.048 --> 45:50.168
Please, allow me.

45:50.170 --> 45:54.535
There was only one person I wished
to talk to before my wedding.

46:23.885 --> 46:26.005
What does He say?

46:26.007 --> 46:28.009
Nothing.

46:31.092 --> 46:32.372
He's 300 years old,

46:32.374 --> 46:35.135
the man they say
I'll marry one day.

46:35.137 --> 46:38.979
That is not
your husband, Mary.

46:38.981 --> 46:42.382
That is the man they've sent
to promise him to you.

46:42.384 --> 46:46.106
And Charles, who is
to be your husband,

46:46.108 --> 46:47.467
is younger than you are.

46:47.469 --> 46:49.471
I won't like him.

46:50.392 --> 46:52.593
You will come to.

46:52.595 --> 46:57.037
One day, when you marry him
and come to know him,

46:57.039 --> 46:59.081
you will learn...

47:00.963 --> 47:05.926
what makes him sad and
what makes him laugh.

47:05.928 --> 47:08.088
That is the adventure.

47:08.090 --> 47:09.410
Is it?

47:09.412 --> 47:11.414
Yes.

47:12.095 --> 47:14.295
It is a glorious
adventure,

47:14.297 --> 47:16.299
to learn
about a person.

47:17.140 --> 47:19.142
Love will follow.

47:19.502 --> 47:21.664
Do you know
what makes Harry laugh?

47:23.266 --> 47:26.147
Yes, I think I do.

47:26.149 --> 47:28.469
I'm not
supposed to tell you,

47:28.471 --> 47:30.473
but I know where Harry is.

47:32.115 --> 47:34.315
He's in Hatfield.

47:34.317 --> 47:36.319
It's not far from London.

47:40.083 --> 47:41.323
Ohh.

47:55.339 --> 47:56.859
Oh, body of Christ.

47:56.861 --> 47:59.103
I'll need a shave
before he gets there.

48:04.348 --> 48:06.108
Charles is very handsome,

48:06.110 --> 48:07.509
and if he
ever annoys you,

48:07.511 --> 48:09.191
I will bite his ear off,

48:09.193 --> 48:11.275
because I'm
his mean old aunt.

48:24.409 --> 48:25.688
<i>The Sieur de Berghes</i>

48:25.690 --> 48:27.210
will receive the blessing
on his feet.

48:30.375 --> 48:31.534
<i>Gracias.</i>

48:31.536 --> 48:33.176
Mary, you as well.

48:41.587 --> 48:43.547
I know where Harry is.

48:43.549 --> 48:46.309
He is only a few
hours' ride from here.

49:00.926 --> 49:02.566
What have you for me?

49:02.568 --> 49:04.570
I, uh...

49:05.691 --> 49:07.773
I don't know
if this is a...

49:09.695 --> 49:14.098
"George Neville,
William Courtenay,

49:14.100 --> 49:16.060
Margaret Pole."

49:16.062 --> 49:18.544
It is God's work
you have done.

49:20.747 --> 49:22.306
You men,
pay attention.

49:22.308 --> 49:23.548
My Lady.

49:25.111 --> 49:27.113
<i>We're here
to serve you, My Lady.</i>

49:32.439 --> 49:34.639
What is it?

49:34.641 --> 49:35.720
What is happening?

49:35.722 --> 49:38.123
The safety of the realm.

49:38.125 --> 49:40.165
I give my thanks to God.

49:40.167 --> 49:41.766
The Spanish alliance
is sealed,

49:41.768 --> 49:46.251
and our greatest enemy
is brought home to us,

49:46.253 --> 49:48.734
Edmund de la Pool.

49:48.736 --> 49:51.296
Your sister paved the way
with Spanish gold.

49:51.298 --> 49:55.701
Tonight, all those who plotted
with him will meet their end,

49:55.703 --> 49:58.383
including
Lady Margaret Pole.

49:58.385 --> 50:00.385
Does Prince Harry
know of this?

50:00.387 --> 50:01.627
They are his family.

50:01.629 --> 50:03.108
They are traitors.

50:03.110 --> 50:05.230
They're a threat to him.

50:05.232 --> 50:08.153
The red rose
will eclipse the white,

50:08.155 --> 50:10.158
as in the Tudor coat.

50:15.243 --> 50:17.283
Lina...

50:17.285 --> 50:18.925
I set this in motion

50:18.927 --> 50:22.488
when I told my sister
how to win her freedom.

50:22.490 --> 50:24.690
I must send word
to warn Maggie.

50:24.692 --> 50:27.694
<i>...Spiritus Sanctus.</i>

50:27.696 --> 50:29.698
<i>♪ Amen ♪</i>

50:31.259 --> 50:32.458
Come on.

50:34.222 --> 50:36.222
Mummy, I need a wee.

50:36.224 --> 50:37.504
Not now, darling,
please.

50:37.506 --> 50:39.506
We're in a hurry.

50:39.508 --> 50:40.667
Look.

50:40.669 --> 50:42.188
There's your brother.

50:42.190 --> 50:45.192
Mummy, I can't hold it.

50:45.194 --> 50:47.196
All right.
Quickly, then.

50:54.283 --> 50:56.285
Hurry.

50:57.406 --> 50:59.366
- <i>Stay where you are!</i>
- <i>Seize them!</i>

50:59.368 --> 51:00.687
<i>Don't move!</i>

51:00.689 --> 51:03.290
- <i>There they are!</i>
- <i>Traitor!</i>

51:08.578 --> 51:10.580
<i>Traitors to the crown!</i>

51:12.822 --> 51:16.304
I've got him!
I've got De la Pool!

51:16.306 --> 51:18.308
Hold them!

51:19.188 --> 51:22.270
You've got your orders!
I want all of them!

51:22.272 --> 51:23.671
Let me go!

51:23.673 --> 51:24.792
Take them.

51:24.794 --> 51:25.873
Henry, no.

51:25.875 --> 51:27.877
Tudor bastard!

51:30.240 --> 51:32.800
- Come here.
- No. No.

51:32.802 --> 51:34.722
No. Don't choose
this day to die, boy.

51:34.724 --> 51:36.564
- No. Henry!
- Stay still,

51:36.566 --> 51:37.726
and I'll protect you.

51:39.810 --> 51:41.169
Get off me!

51:41.171 --> 51:42.410
Come on!

51:42.412 --> 51:43.411
Let go!

51:43.413 --> 51:44.813
Run. Go.

51:44.815 --> 51:45.894
<i>There may be more!</i>

51:45.896 --> 51:47.496
That one, get her!

51:47.498 --> 51:48.737
- Quickly.
- <i>Hold them!</i>

51:48.739 --> 51:49.738
<i>That way!</i>

51:49.740 --> 51:50.899
There they are!

51:50.901 --> 51:52.903
Stop them!

51:53.664 --> 51:55.666
Come on!

52:00.911 --> 52:02.191
<i>This way!</i>

52:02.193 --> 52:03.792
- Run. Run.
- <i>Here!</i>

52:03.794 --> 52:05.394
Mummy!

52:05.396 --> 52:07.636
- <i>In there!</i>
- <i>In here.</i>

52:07.638 --> 52:09.640
Mummy.

52:16.848 --> 52:18.850
This way.

52:24.456 --> 52:27.339
<i>Open up, in the name of the king!</i>

52:28.380 --> 52:30.702
<i>Open this door now!</i>

52:31.743 --> 52:34.264
About fucking time,
Sister.

52:34.266 --> 52:36.466
Ohh!

52:36.468 --> 52:37.787
<i>They went this way.</i>

52:37.789 --> 52:38.828
Wait.

52:38.830 --> 52:40.710
<i>They must be
somewhere.</i>

52:40.712 --> 52:42.512
<i>Find them!</i>

52:42.514 --> 52:44.516
Over here!

52:44.957 --> 52:46.959
Look through there!

52:47.960 --> 52:49.962
<i>No sign of 'em.</i>

52:50.602 --> 52:52.322
Good girl.

52:52.324 --> 52:54.326
Come.

52:56.569 --> 52:58.571
Don't run.
