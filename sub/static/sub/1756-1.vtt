01:09.361 --> 01:11.654
There is no darkness without light,

01:11.655 --> 01:15.750
and yet there is light
without darkness.

01:18.787 --> 01:21.415
I have both within me.

02:13.925 --> 02:15.384
Flyby to Ghost,

02:15.385 --> 02:17.386
you're about 20 miles
out from target.

02:17.387 --> 02:20.185
There are no bogies
visible from above.

02:20.807 --> 02:22.308
Roger that, Flyby.

02:22.309 --> 02:24.435
So tell me, is there any good
restaurants around here?

02:24.436 --> 02:27.485
Nobody told me Movie
Star can't cook.

02:31.068 --> 02:34.663
Yeah, that's a negative on
the restaurants, Ghost.

03:06.311 --> 03:11.273
Ghost, this is Director Styles.

03:11.274 --> 03:12.942
Reaper-1 is now online.

03:12.943 --> 03:15.861
We're maintaining a safe and
invisible distance to target.

03:15.862 --> 03:18.781
We're getting a good image of
what's going on down there.

03:18.782 --> 03:21.284
Ready to bring Hellfire
down on your command.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.539
Look, I'm sorry about
cutting your team.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.791
This is a mission we
need to keep quiet.

03:28.792 --> 03:31.260
You're operating as
a two-man team now.

03:37.801 --> 03:40.845
Target name: Abu Alwaki Khan.

03:40.846 --> 03:44.140
The ground-branch comedians
called him Abu Normal.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.684
Your primary target
remains Abdul Normal.

03:46.685 --> 03:49.478
We have new information
on the secondary target,

03:49.479 --> 03:51.322
an arms dealer.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.570
Hey, Ghost.

03:55.193 --> 03:56.990
We gotta go.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.492
Our secondary target is
a Chicom arms dealer,

04:03.493 --> 04:08.123
an Islamic fundamentalist who
finances terrorist activities.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.505
We go by call signs.

04:16.505 --> 04:18.923
We never know a team
member's real name.

04:18.925 --> 04:20.801
You're now five miles out, Ghost.

04:20.802 --> 04:23.387
Switching to radio silence.
Over and out.

04:23.388 --> 04:26.265
I don't feel good about
them splintering our team.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.809
We a 12-man team, minimum of six.

04:28.810 --> 04:31.520
We down to fucking two
'cause they had to go kill

04:31.521 --> 04:34.857
some fucking high-value
target up in the north

04:34.858 --> 04:37.026
50 minutes from here.
What the fuck is that?

04:37.027 --> 04:39.612
Well, it's a small camp.

04:39.613 --> 04:44.074
VICD confirmed target's
there, that right?

04:44.075 --> 04:46.869
UAV followed him in there
about 45 minutes ago.

04:46.870 --> 04:49.538
He's got a protection
detail of three shooters.

04:49.539 --> 04:51.916
We've had eyes on that
target ever since,

04:51.917 --> 04:53.876
and there's been nobody
in and nobody out.

04:53.877 --> 04:57.630
Since when a guy like that
got three security detail?

04:57.631 --> 05:00.883
He got 15 motherfuckers in there
with guns and you know it.

05:00.884 --> 05:03.182
This intel is fucked up.

05:04.387 --> 05:06.430
Well, we don't know
how many shooters

05:06.431 --> 05:08.057
he could have already
in that building.

05:08.058 --> 05:10.726
Look, before we stick
our dick in anything,

05:10.727 --> 05:13.813
we're gonna sneak up and take
a good look before we commit.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.940
Here's to dead enemies
and live friends

05:15.941 --> 05:17.691
and all y'all
motherfuckers going home.

05:17.692 --> 05:19.409
Roger that.

05:20.779 --> 05:22.531
Let me tack up.

05:26.618 --> 05:28.035
How it look out there?

05:28.036 --> 05:30.996
Looks good. Good conditions, bro.

05:30.997 --> 05:33.749
- Nice and quiet?
- Yeah, I like it.

05:33.750 --> 05:36.335
I wonder how much pussy he get.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.254
Do you think he get
more than, like,

05:38.255 --> 05:40.598
Osama bin Laden got?

05:41.174 --> 05:43.592
I'm... I'm gonna be
sorry to kill his ass.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.511
A lot of virgins are
gonna be happy though.

05:45.512 --> 05:49.107
- That's true, once he go up there.
- Yeah.

05:50.934 --> 05:53.277
Okay. Take a look at this here.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.480
That's our route in.

05:56.481 --> 05:59.775
Let's get positioned in this building
here, but we gotta clear this first

05:59.776 --> 06:01.944
before we get into the
hornets' nest over here.

06:01.945 --> 06:05.289
Try to figure out...
we make a decision in here.

06:05.824 --> 06:07.867
Oh, fuck me, man.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.915
What you got?

06:25.552 --> 06:27.761
Ghost to nest, ghost to nest,

06:27.762 --> 06:29.346
you're getting too
close, man, back off.

06:29.347 --> 06:30.973
You're gonna give my position away.

06:30.974 --> 06:33.017
Roger that, Ghost.

06:33.018 --> 06:34.685
Once Abu Normal is
confirmed to be in there,

06:34.686 --> 06:36.645
you can take him out,
but wait for my word.

06:36.646 --> 06:38.689
Standing by. Over and out.

06:38.690 --> 06:41.108
We got the chickenshit
sandwich now, boy.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.577
Well, let's go get this bastard.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.601
Come on.

08:46.484 --> 08:48.076
Clear.

09:06.004 --> 09:07.801
Whoa. Thank you, bro.

09:17.974 --> 09:20.818
Looks good. Compound clear.

09:54.344 --> 09:58.180
Okay, Ghost, got
eyes on, settled in.

09:58.181 --> 09:59.640
You're good to go.

09:59.641 --> 10:02.439
Oh. Check that. We got a rover.

10:03.186 --> 10:05.688
Be advised: one rover.

10:20.203 --> 10:21.870
Okay, that rover... he is up.

10:21.871 --> 10:23.372
He's on top.

10:23.373 --> 10:26.041
Looks like he's walking
off into the woods, bro.

10:26.042 --> 10:28.418
You're clear. Go
ahead, make your move.

10:28.419 --> 10:31.046
Looking good. Six is clear.

10:31.047 --> 10:34.424
Movie Star, can you see
anything inside the hooch?

10:34.425 --> 10:37.303
Negative. Hang on.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.683
I see four.

10:42.976 --> 10:46.728
Four Haj... check that,
check that, six...

10:46.729 --> 10:50.399
six Hajis, all got AKs.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.152
Ghost, a man in a white coat...

10:53.153 --> 10:55.075
could be our second target.

10:57.907 --> 11:00.910
Okay, confirmation
on target, stand by.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.760
Ghost to nest, visual
confirmation on the target.

11:18.761 --> 11:21.684
They're using human
shields. No joy, no joy.

11:25.810 --> 11:28.270
This is Nest. We have a
lock on your position.

11:28.271 --> 11:31.866
We have orders to initiate
Hellfire now. Stand down.

11:35.778 --> 11:38.113
I repeat, they're
using human shields.

11:38.114 --> 11:40.537
No joy, no joy!

11:55.840 --> 11:58.800
Okay, be advised, our
rover is returning.

11:58.801 --> 12:00.598
He's 30 yards out.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.355
You're gonna have to
take this guy out.

12:11.356 --> 12:13.607
I can't crack him there.
He'll create a hornets' nest.

12:13.608 --> 12:15.192
You've got him. He's 10 yards out.

12:15.193 --> 12:18.446
10 yards. He's on your six.

12:20.365 --> 12:22.324
Five, four,

12:22.325 --> 12:24.326
three, two...

12:24.327 --> 12:26.454
two steps. He's there.

12:33.878 --> 12:36.255
I'm going in now,
repeat, going in now.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.303
On my way to you.
I'm on my way to you.

12:58.861 --> 13:01.113
Move.

13:03.449 --> 13:08.036
Call off the strike. Abu Normal's
on the move. Call off the strike.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.335
- We've got women and children in here.
- Papa! Papi!

13:13.293 --> 13:15.545
Target locked, sequence initiated.

13:22.385 --> 13:24.261
Direct hit on Abu Normal.

13:24.262 --> 13:26.639
No joy on the secondary target.

13:28.099 --> 13:30.434
Call off the air-strike!
We've got kids in here!

13:30.435 --> 13:32.983
Negative, Ghost.
Hellfire is initiated.

13:37.066 --> 13:39.910
Come with me! We gotta
get out of here!

14:07.013 --> 14:08.764
Flyby, this is command.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.733
We have a direct hit.

14:20.068 --> 14:22.570
Ghost! Ghost, how you doing?

14:25.198 --> 14:27.991
It's my right... right side.

14:27.992 --> 14:29.618
Check the girl.

14:29.619 --> 14:32.621
- Nothing's broke.
- Check the girl.

14:32.622 --> 14:35.250
Hey. You okay?

14:35.792 --> 14:37.760
She's not moving.

15:29.595 --> 15:32.063
Some things never change.

16:01.752 --> 16:05.222
Mya, do you have the keys?

16:08.801 --> 16:11.224
You hungry? Come here.

16:15.433 --> 16:18.527
Don't tell me I lost them again.

16:19.562 --> 16:22.690
- Hey.
- What's happening? Are you locked out?

16:23.774 --> 16:27.574
- You want some help?
- This would be great.

16:32.408 --> 16:35.161
The second time I've lost my keys.

16:37.622 --> 16:39.339
I think I can fix that.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.001
- My name's Lena...
- Nice to meet you.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.795
and she's my sister, Mya.

16:45.796 --> 16:48.965
- What's happening?
- What's his name?

16:48.966 --> 16:51.510
You know, I just never named him.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.303
You can name him.

16:53.304 --> 16:54.804
Roman.

16:54.805 --> 16:57.015
- Roman.
- Roman?

16:57.016 --> 16:59.109
Roman it is.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.571
Come on, doggy.

17:36.013 --> 17:38.106
Pretty.

17:38.808 --> 17:40.434
Good boy.

17:42.395 --> 17:45.397
- Okay, there you go.
- Thank you. Wow.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.023
That was easy.

17:47.024 --> 17:49.693
- Thanks.
- Alexander.

17:49.694 --> 17:51.787
Thanks, Alexander.

17:53.239 --> 17:55.082
Mya.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.159
Go inside and say goodbye.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.828
- Bye.
- Bye, Roman.

17:59.829 --> 18:01.663
Go, go, go, go.

18:01.664 --> 18:04.165
I'll come by later and
drop off a new lock.

18:04.166 --> 18:05.834
Any time.

18:05.835 --> 18:08.838
Nice to finally meet you, neighbor.

18:11.132 --> 18:13.009
Nice to meet you.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.015
Come here, boy.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.658
Where do you think you're going?!

18:36.866 --> 18:38.663
Catch him!

18:45.541 --> 18:47.384
Pick him up.

18:52.173 --> 18:53.640
Let's go.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.003
I have already paid!

19:32.004 --> 19:33.881
I swear it.

19:34.423 --> 19:36.015
Hey, Amerikansky.

19:38.135 --> 19:40.888
He says he already paid.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.891
When you speak to me

19:44.892 --> 19:48.066
you speak in English.

19:48.604 --> 19:50.447
You know that.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.697
This is not fair.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.865
I work hard for this money.

20:00.866 --> 20:03.702
I understand. We work hard...

20:03.703 --> 20:05.750
to provide you protection.

20:07.456 --> 20:09.958
But it comes at a price.

20:11.460 --> 20:15.089
I think I need protection
from Mr. Vladimir.

20:15.965 --> 20:17.933
Hey!

20:18.634 --> 20:20.635
You don't pay up next week,

20:20.636 --> 20:22.303
I'm taking your fucking tongue.

20:22.304 --> 20:23.680
Don't!

20:23.681 --> 20:26.559
Okay okay. Okay.

20:28.310 --> 20:30.812
Just give me a second.

20:42.533 --> 20:44.785
How much are you short?

20:48.998 --> 20:51.250
Watch the door.

21:18.652 --> 21:20.904
Don't mistake this act of kindness

21:20.905 --> 21:22.827
as weakness.

21:24.366 --> 21:25.992
Are we clear?

21:26.577 --> 21:29.830
- Are we clear?
- Yeah.

21:35.044 --> 21:37.546
He's square. I'm gonna grab a bite.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.598
Da?

21:43.969 --> 21:46.221
Da. Wait.

21:46.222 --> 21:48.389
Vladimir says there's a problem.

21:48.390 --> 21:50.517
He wants you to check it out.

22:23.092 --> 22:24.259
Same as others?

22:24.260 --> 22:25.927
Da, sliced and diced.

22:25.928 --> 22:27.600
Identical MO.

22:36.272 --> 22:40.777
Gangs killing rival gangs I guess?

22:41.610 --> 22:43.820
But why leave incense?

22:43.821 --> 22:45.864
It's Chinese.

22:45.865 --> 22:50.535
They believe incense to be associated
with the "yin" energies of the dead.

22:50.536 --> 22:53.663
Burning joss sticks
attracts ghosts,

22:53.664 --> 22:57.834
who consume the smoke and destroy
the fortunes of the family.

22:57.835 --> 22:59.382
It's symbolic.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.308
Googled it.

23:33.746 --> 23:36.623
These guys... look very Russian.

23:36.624 --> 23:39.834
Yeah. The cross
signifies prison time

23:39.835 --> 23:42.337
and the ring finger indicates rank.

23:42.338 --> 23:45.591
This arm belongs to a lieutenant.

23:51.597 --> 23:53.770
Okay. So...

23:54.433 --> 23:56.351
let's find out which Russian gangs

23:56.352 --> 23:58.479
are missing a lieutenant...

23:59.188 --> 24:02.487
and has a beef with the
Chinaman assassins.

24:10.282 --> 24:12.408
Hey, Sasha, I don't suppose

24:12.409 --> 24:14.786
you'd know anything about
this mess, would you?

24:14.787 --> 24:17.205
You know me better
than that, Constable.

24:17.206 --> 24:19.333
I'm just getting a bite.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.593
Afternoon, Father.

25:09.425 --> 25:13.594
Alexander. I've seen you
pass by many many times.

25:13.595 --> 25:16.472
First time you
actually came inside.

25:16.473 --> 25:19.100
Yeah, just looking around.

25:19.101 --> 25:22.400
Of course. Feel free.

25:22.938 --> 25:24.940
Thanks.

25:57.639 --> 25:59.599
You must be Mya's brother.

25:59.600 --> 26:03.394
- Yeah, how'd you know?
- Hey, where's your dog?

26:03.395 --> 26:07.274
You mean Roman.
He's at my apartment.

26:08.025 --> 26:09.817
I'll bring him by later.

26:09.818 --> 26:12.820
That's the man I've been
telling you about...

26:12.821 --> 26:15.119
our new neighbor with the dog.

26:17.826 --> 26:21.000
Okay. I gotta get out of here.

26:22.998 --> 26:24.373
Just in case...

26:24.374 --> 26:26.250
you get hungry, here's a little...

26:26.251 --> 26:28.845
whoa. Hey. No, you
can't have all that.

26:29.880 --> 26:32.173
- There you go.
- Thank you.

26:32.174 --> 26:34.642
You're coming by tonight?

26:35.344 --> 26:36.928
I can't. I gotta work,

26:36.929 --> 26:38.521
but I'll call.

26:39.056 --> 26:40.681
- You still have it?
- Have what?

26:40.682 --> 26:42.650
The key.

26:43.268 --> 26:44.393
What key?

26:44.394 --> 26:46.562
I give you... on the neck.

26:46.563 --> 26:48.606
I don't know what
you're talking about.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.950
The neck.

26:52.569 --> 26:56.531
- Yeah. Yeah!
- This key. This key.

26:56.532 --> 26:58.407
- Yeah.
- Of course I have.

26:58.408 --> 27:00.910
I never leave home without it.

27:00.911 --> 27:02.787
- Good.
- All right.

27:02.788 --> 27:04.460
I'll see you later.

27:35.404 --> 27:37.780
No. But whoever it was

27:37.781 --> 27:40.658
left joss sticks on
the bodies again.

27:40.659 --> 27:43.452
Yeah, he's sending a message.

27:43.453 --> 27:45.876
And the money?

27:49.209 --> 27:52.428
One last thing. Vladimir...

27:52.963 --> 27:55.261
who is she?

27:57.926 --> 27:59.848
Just a girl.

28:28.624 --> 28:30.124
Feels light.

28:30.125 --> 28:33.127
It's all in there, sir.

28:33.128 --> 28:35.671
If you like, I could...

28:35.672 --> 28:38.132
at least you and your men
made it here alive tonight.

28:38.133 --> 28:41.219
Let's keep it that way.
I can't afford to do business

28:41.220 --> 28:44.189
with some Chinese
ninja out hunting us.

28:45.515 --> 28:46.891
Give this to Chen... clean.

28:46.892 --> 28:48.851
And before you go, enjoy the girls.

28:48.852 --> 28:50.899
Tonight, it's on the house.

28:52.689 --> 28:54.782
Hey!

28:57.319 --> 28:59.492
Try Lena, the girl behind the bar.

29:01.823 --> 29:03.791
Leave the girl alone.

29:12.834 --> 29:15.169
It's all there.

29:15.170 --> 29:18.005
My sister working here was
not part of our deal.

29:18.006 --> 29:20.341
You are telling me what to do now?

29:20.342 --> 29:23.261
Your sister is here so I
can keep an eye on her,

29:23.262 --> 29:25.846
- to keep her safe.
- If she works here,

29:25.847 --> 29:27.682
I say she's for sale,

29:27.683 --> 29:30.311
like the rest of the bitches.

29:43.573 --> 29:46.667
You promised my
family protection...

29:48.537 --> 29:51.961
if I came here to work
off my father's debt.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.959
I am upholding my part of the deal.

29:54.960 --> 29:58.045
Yes, and you are very
good at what you do.

29:58.046 --> 30:00.389
That makes you valuable to me.

30:01.216 --> 30:03.138
You want out, no?

30:04.553 --> 30:06.095
That's why you are here...

30:06.096 --> 30:08.889
to rescue your family.

30:08.890 --> 30:10.891
Noble, truly.

30:10.892 --> 30:12.727
But Lena is beautiful.

30:12.728 --> 30:16.198
She could make me a lot of money.

30:17.399 --> 30:18.899
But Aleksey is right.

30:18.900 --> 30:21.444
Lena here is nothing more
to me than a pretty girl

30:21.445 --> 30:24.322
behind the bar, and
until the debt is paid,

30:24.323 --> 30:29.076
she is my girl, not yours.

30:29.077 --> 30:31.170
Remember that.

30:47.846 --> 30:50.769
- Who is it?
- Alexander.

30:51.725 --> 30:53.522
Wait a minute.

31:00.776 --> 31:02.985
I brought you a new lock,

31:02.986 --> 31:06.447
unless you and your sister want
to keep using a screwdriver.

31:06.448 --> 31:08.916
Wait a minute.

31:16.291 --> 31:17.625
Hey.

31:17.626 --> 31:20.424
Hi, Roman. Come on.

31:22.756 --> 31:24.678
Come on.

31:48.990 --> 31:51.826
Okay, so you're an American.

31:51.827 --> 31:54.625
What are you doing here?

31:55.205 --> 31:56.664
Sasha's an American.

31:56.665 --> 31:59.291
What's he doing here?
He's... kind of over there

31:59.292 --> 32:02.670
with a guy who's not a
very good human being.

32:02.671 --> 32:05.840
- What's your relation to him?
- Vladimir?

32:05.841 --> 32:07.684
In business with him?

32:08.218 --> 32:10.812
Yes, you could say that.

32:15.267 --> 32:17.351
I only come here to drink.

32:17.352 --> 32:20.062
This is kind of a bad neighborhood
you're walking through.

32:20.063 --> 32:21.188
I thought I'd walk you home.

32:21.189 --> 32:23.023
Hey, bitch.

32:23.024 --> 32:25.568
Are you work here or what?
Hey, where are you going, honey?

32:25.569 --> 32:27.361
I want a lap dance.

32:27.362 --> 32:31.282
You know, it takes the IQ
of a mature caterpillar

32:31.283 --> 32:33.242
to know the difference

32:33.243 --> 32:36.162
between the staff and the dancers.

32:36.163 --> 32:39.039
- You understand?
- I want that bar bitch to dance for me,

32:39.040 --> 32:40.792
so fuck you.

32:46.089 --> 32:48.924
- Shall we go?
- Are you for real?

32:48.925 --> 32:51.393
Not really. It's all fake.

33:00.729 --> 33:02.021
Well, Mya was worried.

33:02.022 --> 33:04.690
Yeah, poor thing.
She's alone so much.

33:04.691 --> 33:08.286
It was worse... a lot worse
before Sasha came back.

33:09.988 --> 33:12.907
- And...?
- And...

33:12.908 --> 33:15.409
Our father owed money
to the Russian mob,

33:15.410 --> 33:20.211
he died and the debt fell
onto me and my sister.

33:21.333 --> 33:24.001
And how is it you got
mixed up with Vladimir?

33:24.002 --> 33:25.924
With Vladimir.

33:26.421 --> 33:28.422
Sasha... Sasha is my half-brother.

33:28.423 --> 33:30.799
He grew up in the states.
He was in the military

33:30.800 --> 33:32.468
and was stationed over here.

33:32.469 --> 33:34.720
So when he heard about our problem,

33:34.721 --> 33:36.939
he came to help us out.

33:44.439 --> 33:47.943
Hey, asshole, do you know
who that ho belongs to?

33:49.194 --> 33:50.694
Yeah, she belongs to me.

33:50.695 --> 33:52.780
Why? Vladimir sent you?

33:52.781 --> 33:56.784
Tell Vladimir Piteras if he has
something to say, say it to me.

33:56.785 --> 33:58.410
Take this. I'm gonna
talk to these guys.

33:58.411 --> 34:00.458
- Okay.
- Can you do that for me?

35:08.690 --> 35:10.399
Lock yourself out again?

35:10.400 --> 35:13.119
No, just worried about you.

35:14.279 --> 35:16.747
Why don't you come in?

35:24.414 --> 35:26.382
Thanks.

35:28.293 --> 35:30.377
I can't believe those assholes.

35:30.378 --> 35:32.046
Thanks for helping me...

35:32.047 --> 35:34.548
- again.
- I didn't do nothing, ma'am.

35:34.549 --> 35:37.509
I'm just a handyman.
I work with saws,

35:37.510 --> 35:40.179
and screwdrivers,
and hammers, and...

35:40.180 --> 35:42.057
simple stuff like that.

35:42.724 --> 35:44.975
They were Vladimir's men.

35:44.976 --> 35:48.776
You said earlier that Sasha was
working with some dangerous men.

35:49.814 --> 35:51.398
You know all about them, don't you?

35:51.399 --> 35:53.150
I do.

35:53.151 --> 35:56.070
Then you know once there is a debt,

35:56.071 --> 35:57.404
there's no getting away.

35:57.405 --> 36:02.081
So, as long as Vladimir
needs Sasha, here we are.

36:03.286 --> 36:06.246
But it will come a day when
Vladimir doesn't need him anymore,

36:06.247 --> 36:08.415
- and when that day come...
- When that day comes,

36:08.416 --> 36:11.251
you go away to a nice, safe place

36:11.252 --> 36:15.347
and you have to never think
about them again. You hear?

36:18.551 --> 36:20.594
I'm glad you made it home safe.

36:20.595 --> 36:22.597
So am I.

36:48.957 --> 36:53.460
Ooh, the rate this guy's going,

36:53.461 --> 36:57.090
we're going to be out
of Russians soon.

36:58.508 --> 37:00.635
Again with the incense.

37:03.054 --> 37:04.638
And the Chinese
writing... Gwai Lo...

37:04.639 --> 37:06.482
it means "white ghost."

37:07.142 --> 37:08.600
But not a derogatory
sense, you know?

37:08.601 --> 37:11.186
Like he sa... he's
saying it with pride.

37:11.187 --> 37:12.646
You know?

37:12.647 --> 37:16.316
A vendetta. So he's not Chinese.

37:16.317 --> 37:17.943
Maybe.

37:20.488 --> 37:22.786
Ah... okay.

37:23.324 --> 37:25.952
Oh, I googled the tats.

37:26.703 --> 37:29.171
You were right about
the last victims.

37:30.331 --> 37:32.128
These guys...

37:33.334 --> 37:35.502
have the same ink.

37:35.503 --> 37:37.212
Yeah, but they're low level,

37:37.213 --> 37:40.512
- Foot soldiers.
- So?

37:41.676 --> 37:44.595
- Messengers?
- Bag men.

37:44.596 --> 37:46.769
They were transporting something.

37:53.855 --> 37:57.029
Something our assailant has
taken, probably money.

37:58.109 --> 38:00.110
The way they are cut up...

38:00.111 --> 38:03.030
the killer obviously is
very skilled with a knife.

38:03.031 --> 38:07.456
Short sword. I'm guessing our
man is sending a message.

38:07.994 --> 38:10.292
- A warning?
- Yeah.

38:10.955 --> 38:12.623
But the question is,
a warning to whom?

38:12.624 --> 38:14.341
But the question is,
a warning to whom?

38:36.731 --> 38:38.565
Keep your mouth shut

38:38.566 --> 38:40.818
and do what I do.

39:03.091 --> 39:05.425
My buyer,

39:05.426 --> 39:07.519
a very good customer...

39:08.346 --> 39:10.639
he likes big weapons,

39:10.640 --> 39:13.141
dangerous weapons,

39:13.142 --> 39:15.686
expensive weapons.

39:15.687 --> 39:20.693
All you had to do was launder
this money through your club.

39:21.985 --> 39:24.328
Now the money's gone missing.

39:26.865 --> 39:30.835
I cannot honor my
deal with my buyer.

39:34.330 --> 39:36.206
Mr. Chen, I would never...

39:36.207 --> 39:38.876
never... steal from you.

39:38.877 --> 39:41.044
But these murders, they
are disrupting my ability

39:41.045 --> 39:43.130
- to do bus...
- Oh.

39:43.131 --> 39:44.923
You were short last month.

39:44.924 --> 39:48.802
This is your way of saying
you're short yet again?

39:48.803 --> 39:52.933
No, Mr. Chen, I just
need more time.

40:09.949 --> 40:14.579
Li Wei just confirmed that you have
this Russian girl at your club.

40:15.997 --> 40:18.040
You are very fortunate...

40:18.041 --> 40:20.500
that my buyer has this proclivity

40:20.501 --> 40:23.003
for beautiful Russian girls.

40:23.004 --> 40:25.422
The younger, the better.

40:25.423 --> 40:29.009
Maybe I can... repair the situation

40:29.010 --> 40:31.854
with the help of
your Russian beauty.

40:35.850 --> 40:40.520
You know, I am reminded
of this old proverb

40:40.521 --> 40:44.441
that if you stand by the
river's edge long enough,

40:44.442 --> 40:46.652
eventually...

40:46.653 --> 40:51.454
you will see your dead
enemy's body floating past.

40:59.874 --> 41:01.671
the money or...

41:03.503 --> 41:05.004
Your choice.

41:41.916 --> 41:43.250
Why didn't you call me?

41:43.251 --> 41:45.836
I told you, Alexander
took care of it.

41:45.837 --> 41:48.422
- It wasn't any problem.
- It wasn't a problem?

41:48.423 --> 41:51.216
- No.
- Right.

41:51.217 --> 41:54.436
Lena, do you have any idea
what's going on right now?

41:55.138 --> 41:57.811
You don't. You call me.

42:13.364 --> 42:16.913
- Alexander?
- How can I help you?

42:18.661 --> 42:20.412
Replacing the lock.

42:20.413 --> 42:22.289
Oh, yeah.

42:22.290 --> 42:24.124
What do you think I am,
man? Put that away.

42:24.125 --> 42:27.127
And I also wanted to say thanks for
what you did for my sister last night.

42:27.128 --> 42:29.050
I didn't do nothing.

42:29.881 --> 42:32.466
Look, I do the best that I can

42:32.467 --> 42:33.842
to take care of my family,

42:33.843 --> 42:37.637
but I can't be all
places all the time.

42:37.638 --> 42:41.062
So what you did last night...

42:42.060 --> 42:43.777
I appreciate it.

42:45.313 --> 42:47.689
Look, man, I have a
rope around here...

42:47.690 --> 42:50.025
on the Russians, with the Chinese.

42:50.026 --> 42:54.196
There's bad guys that live by a
code of ethics and follow the rules

42:54.197 --> 42:55.822
and there are those who don't.

42:55.823 --> 42:57.699
You're running with
those who don't.

42:57.700 --> 43:00.118
You're right.

43:00.119 --> 43:02.162
It's still none of your business.

43:02.163 --> 43:06.918
- Keep that in mind.
- My family, my business.

43:11.672 --> 43:12.672
All right.

43:12.673 --> 43:14.841
We're not gonna be here
much longer, anyway.

43:14.842 --> 43:17.219
You can count on that.

43:18.930 --> 43:20.682
I gotta go.

43:21.641 --> 43:24.935
Oh, and I sincerely hope that you didn't
have anything to do with what happened

43:24.936 --> 43:26.603
to Vladimir's men last night.

43:26.604 --> 43:28.401
Not me.

43:50.586 --> 43:52.383
Hello.

43:54.382 --> 43:55.632
Amerikansky.

43:55.633 --> 43:57.134
Hey, Why'd you call
me at a payphone?

43:57.135 --> 43:58.510
I was downstairs at the club.

43:58.511 --> 44:00.387
So I would be able
to speak with you,

44:00.388 --> 44:03.557
Knowing that our conversation
will remain in private.

44:03.558 --> 44:05.105
Sasha...

44:05.643 --> 44:07.227
I'm afraid we suspect

44:07.228 --> 44:10.527
one of our own stealing
from Mr. Chen.

44:12.316 --> 44:14.401
Are you talking about the murders?

44:14.402 --> 44:16.904
Yes, Sasha, the murders.

44:20.032 --> 44:22.742
Okay. Just wait a second.

44:22.743 --> 44:26.538
Vladimir, I would never
steal from you or Mr. Chen,

44:26.539 --> 44:28.665
let alone kill one of our own.

44:28.666 --> 44:30.584
I may believe that, Sasha,

44:30.585 --> 44:33.044
But Mr. Chen is not the
sort that is comforted

44:33.045 --> 44:35.547
by panicked assurances.

44:36.299 --> 44:38.091
But if it makes you
feel any better,

44:38.092 --> 44:40.969
he will continue to care
for your lovely sister

44:40.970 --> 44:44.264
long after you are dead and buried.

44:44.265 --> 44:46.141
I didn't kill anyone!

44:46.142 --> 44:48.736
I swear to you! You
have to tell him that!

45:03.701 --> 45:06.124
Wait! Andrei!

45:29.227 --> 45:31.603
and try your call again.

45:31.604 --> 45:33.947
Please hang up.

45:51.457 --> 45:53.834
Oh... fuck!

46:57.398 --> 46:59.195
Mya?

47:23.424 --> 47:25.221
What's going on?

47:27.928 --> 47:29.679
Where is Sasha?

47:29.680 --> 47:31.890
Did something happen to him?

47:31.891 --> 47:34.893
- Yes, something happened to Sasha.
- What?

47:34.894 --> 47:36.686
Your brother was a thief,

47:36.687 --> 47:38.938
so he had to pay with
his life, I'm afraid.

47:38.939 --> 47:41.983
- No, that's impossible.
- I'm afraid it's possible and finished.

47:41.984 --> 47:44.277
But this is not the
reason I'm here.

47:44.278 --> 47:46.621
I'm here for you.

47:47.782 --> 47:49.949
You're a smart and
very attractive girl.

47:49.950 --> 47:52.452
Now I can see why
Mr. Chen had decided

47:52.453 --> 47:54.704
to keep you for himself.

47:54.705 --> 47:57.003
Don't touch me!

47:57.541 --> 47:59.292
Now be smart and watch your tongue.

47:59.293 --> 48:02.296
I don't want to mess up
that lovely mouth of yours.

48:06.342 --> 48:09.061
- No.
- Go in that room.

48:09.720 --> 48:11.638
Mya.

48:11.639 --> 48:13.482
Keep her quiet.

48:42.670 --> 48:43.837
Mya!

48:43.838 --> 48:45.510
Lena.

48:46.966 --> 48:49.926
Mr. Chen is willing to
take her over money.

48:49.927 --> 48:53.522
I'd be a fool to turn
her over so easily.

48:55.349 --> 48:56.896
Okay.

48:57.435 --> 48:59.561
Slight change of plans.

48:59.562 --> 49:02.856
- Keep her safe. Let's go.
- Mya! No.

49:02.857 --> 49:04.483
Stop!

49:05.067 --> 49:06.651
Mya!

49:06.652 --> 49:08.654
No!

49:29.091 --> 49:32.344
Do that again and
your sister is dead.

49:34.722 --> 49:35.847
Do you understand me?

49:35.848 --> 49:38.476
Now be a good girl
and get in the car.

49:42.229 --> 49:44.902
Oh Shit.

49:50.946 --> 49:53.039
Quit staring at me, bitch.

49:56.243 --> 49:58.953
Go on. Test me.

49:58.954 --> 50:01.127
I dare you.

50:04.752 --> 50:07.220
Give us a minute.

50:21.769 --> 50:25.068
- What's going on?
- We got trouble.

50:28.651 --> 50:30.619
Come on.

50:35.658 --> 50:37.617
Stay here.

50:37.618 --> 50:39.285
Go back to your room.

50:39.286 --> 50:41.254
Back to my room?

50:41.789 --> 50:43.666
Uh-huh.

50:46.961 --> 50:48.804
You want some?

51:09.316 --> 51:11.784
You're gonna die, motherfucker.

51:30.671 --> 51:32.172
Alexander.

51:34.842 --> 51:36.926
- Are you hurt?
- No.

51:36.927 --> 51:39.679
They took Mya. Sasha's dead.

51:39.680 --> 51:42.390
- This can't be happening.
- Well, he... he's not dead.

51:42.391 --> 51:44.100
That's for sure.

51:44.101 --> 51:47.020
Why do you think Vladimir took Mya?

51:47.021 --> 51:49.188
He said he was taking
her to Mr. Chen.

51:49.189 --> 51:52.900
Mr. Chen wanted me,
but he took Mya instead.

51:52.901 --> 51:56.112
I don't even know who Mr. Chen is.

51:56.113 --> 51:58.365
Well, I do. Come on.

52:31.190 --> 52:34.534
Sir, I know who took your money.

52:36.403 --> 52:39.031
I don't care who took my money.

52:41.200 --> 52:43.117
We made a deal.

52:43.118 --> 52:45.411
The cash, the girl

52:45.412 --> 52:50.166
or I'll kill you and
your entire family.

52:50.167 --> 52:53.336
This is the thief's sister.

52:53.337 --> 52:56.260
I brought her to you
for collateral.

52:58.634 --> 53:00.677
Are you gaming me?

53:00.678 --> 53:04.102
Or do you have the biggest
pair of balls on earth?

53:06.058 --> 53:08.226
You're running out of time

53:08.227 --> 53:10.445
and excuses, Vladimir.

53:16.944 --> 53:18.277
Hi.

53:18.278 --> 53:21.030
What is your name?

53:21.031 --> 53:23.033
Mya.

53:25.452 --> 53:28.621
Oh, your name is Mya.

53:28.622 --> 53:32.041
She's the little sister
of the one you asked for.

53:32.042 --> 53:34.585
I will have her soon
again, but until then...

53:34.586 --> 53:36.588
I am Mr. Chen.

53:38.632 --> 53:41.009
Take her to the safe house.

53:49.852 --> 53:51.394
The money is one thing,

53:51.395 --> 53:54.897
but when people start
to die around me

53:54.898 --> 53:58.901
with frequency and ferocity,

53:58.902 --> 54:02.113
it usually means that
someone is trying to take

54:02.114 --> 54:03.786
what is rightfully mine.

54:05.200 --> 54:07.994
Is this what you're trying to do?

54:07.995 --> 54:10.204
Mr. Chen, please, I'm
getting your money.

54:10.205 --> 54:11.414
I just thought...

54:11.415 --> 54:13.499
no. No, no, no, no, no!

54:13.500 --> 54:15.460
No, no, no! No!

54:15.461 --> 54:17.044
No!

54:17.045 --> 54:19.013
No! No!

54:39.026 --> 54:42.028
You think too much, Vladimir.

54:42.029 --> 54:44.247
I'm gonna keep the girl.

54:55.250 --> 54:58.219
I would start going if I were you.

56:00.065 --> 56:02.066
- Where are we going?
- To see your brother.

56:02.067 --> 56:04.535
My friend told me
he's hiding out here.

56:14.121 --> 56:15.622
Follow me.

56:17.583 --> 56:19.300
Sasha.

56:22.963 --> 56:25.006
Are you trying to kill me?

56:25.007 --> 56:27.760
Okay, okay, it's good
to see you, too. Yeah.

56:28.302 --> 56:30.094
Thank God you're alive.

56:30.095 --> 56:31.637
Vladimir said that you're dead

56:31.638 --> 56:34.140
- and I thought you were.
- Sorry to disappoint you.

56:34.141 --> 56:39.312
Sasha, Vladimir and Aleksey took
Mya to someone called Mr. Chen.

56:39.313 --> 56:40.980
- What?
- Yeah.

56:40.981 --> 56:43.107
So I know you don't trust me,

56:43.108 --> 56:45.651
but you're gonna have to trust me.

56:45.652 --> 56:47.620
Otherwise, I can't help you.

56:53.827 --> 56:57.246
You know, there is an old
adage from Sun Tzu that says,

56:57.247 --> 56:59.332
"When one first sets out for war,

56:59.333 --> 57:02.335
first dig two graves."

57:02.336 --> 57:06.339
And I'm hoping that you feel
that way about your family.

57:06.340 --> 57:08.174
I'm hoping you're willing to die

57:08.175 --> 57:10.009
in order to save your family.

57:10.010 --> 57:12.638
How you feel about that?

57:13.180 --> 57:15.353
Whatever it takes.

57:16.850 --> 57:19.694
This I call...

57:21.188 --> 57:23.522
It means "the Devil's
Butcher Knife."

57:23.523 --> 57:25.775
I use it a lot. It's
the perfect weapon.

57:25.776 --> 57:28.324
Very quiet.

57:30.364 --> 57:32.958
Why'd you kill Vladimir's men?

57:34.701 --> 57:37.453
Two years ago I was
given an assignment

57:37.454 --> 57:38.955
to terminate a couple terrorists.

57:38.956 --> 57:42.541
One in particular, he was
working with am arms dealer,

57:42.542 --> 57:44.293
and...

57:44.294 --> 57:47.638
I got the terrorist and
the arms dealer got away.

57:49.257 --> 57:51.717
- Mr. Chen.
- That's right.

57:51.718 --> 57:54.720
So the last two years
I've been tracking Chen

57:54.721 --> 57:58.224
through Asia, and went
to Hong Kong and...

57:58.225 --> 58:01.560
killed all of his men, triad style,

58:01.561 --> 58:03.904
just to flush out Chen.

58:04.606 --> 58:07.108
- What's in it?
- I wanted him to think

58:07.109 --> 58:09.276
that it was inside-the-family job,

58:09.277 --> 58:12.071
so I get in there and kill
the bad guys with a sword

58:12.072 --> 58:14.415
and leave joss sticks on the body.

58:14.908 --> 58:18.202
You drew the w... the writing
on the wall. Gwai Lo.

58:18.203 --> 58:20.621
I'm the one that's gonna
save your sister,

58:20.622 --> 58:23.332
and I'm the one that's
gonna kill Chen.

58:23.333 --> 58:26.211
Good. Let me help.

58:27.587 --> 58:29.304
Open it.

58:37.347 --> 58:38.848
It's the money from the drops.

58:38.849 --> 58:41.602
It's... it's Vladimir's money.

58:44.771 --> 58:46.439
All right, let me tell
you what you can do.

58:46.440 --> 58:48.941
You go to Vladimir and
find out how much money

58:48.942 --> 58:51.652
it's gonna take to buy her back.

58:51.653 --> 58:53.863
So you just want me to stroll in

58:53.864 --> 58:55.531
and talk to the guy
that tried to kill me?

58:55.532 --> 58:57.408
Well, he's not gonna kill you,

58:57.409 --> 59:00.119
'cause he knows you're a part of
how he's gonna get the money.

59:00.120 --> 59:02.121
You wait for me here.

59:02.122 --> 59:04.707
You said you were
just a regular man.

59:04.708 --> 59:06.292
Yeah, that's true...

59:06.293 --> 59:10.423
I'm a regular man who does
bad things to bad people.

59:23.685 --> 59:26.103
If Vladimir sees you
here, he will kill you.

59:26.104 --> 59:28.898
- You know that, right?
- Yeah.

59:28.899 --> 59:31.367
Just let him know I'm here.

59:43.288 --> 59:45.165
Hi, Sasha.

59:45.832 --> 59:48.300
I'm supposed to give you a dance.

59:50.796 --> 59:52.923
Of course you are.

01:00:01.473 --> 01:00:04.817
So why did he send you and
not one of his goons?

01:00:05.852 --> 01:00:07.812
I don't ask questions, Sasha.

01:00:07.813 --> 01:00:09.688
You know that.

01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:11.566
I just do as I'm told.

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:14.860
Look, why don't you just sit back

01:00:14.861 --> 01:00:17.034
and enjoy the dance?

01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:34.922
Okay. Passion?

01:00:34.923 --> 01:00:37.972
I need to speak with Vladimir.

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:41.979
Thank you, Passion. That's enough.

01:00:44.057 --> 01:00:47.060
I didn't think I would
see you again, Sasha.

01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:49.528
Easy.

01:00:56.987 --> 01:01:00.036
I'll give you whatever
you want for Mya.

01:01:02.409 --> 01:01:03.909
The price is 300,000.

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:05.536
This is what I owe to Mr. Chen.

01:01:05.537 --> 01:01:07.663
Pay it and you can
have your sister back.

01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:09.882
Sounds reasonable?

01:02:10.185 --> 01:02:11.777
300,000?

01:02:12.479 --> 01:02:14.822
Yeah, reasonable as hell.

01:02:34.376 --> 01:02:36.344
Finally.

01:02:39.839 --> 01:02:41.841
Hey, look, there's our friend.

01:02:43.927 --> 01:02:45.135
Think he might talk either?

01:02:45.136 --> 01:02:47.855
I don't know. Let's find out.

01:02:50.267 --> 01:02:51.850
Hey, Sasha!

01:02:51.851 --> 01:02:54.645
- Yo, man!
- Let's have a word.

01:02:54.646 --> 01:02:57.490
Come. Come, come.

01:03:24.217 --> 01:03:26.469
No no!

01:03:28.138 --> 01:03:31.598
What? No, no, no, no, no!

01:03:31.599 --> 01:03:33.225
No!

01:04:04.424 --> 01:04:06.221
Just a second.

01:04:14.559 --> 01:04:16.311
Yeah.

01:04:16.853 --> 01:04:18.525
I got it under control.

01:04:42.295 --> 01:04:44.797
He said he would be back soon.

01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:49.426
Best to relax

01:04:49.427 --> 01:04:52.554
and not to work yourself up
any more than you are, Lena.

01:04:52.555 --> 01:04:55.432
I know Sasha would do anything
for me and my sister,

01:04:55.433 --> 01:04:58.268
- but Alexander...
- Is just like your brother.

01:04:58.269 --> 01:05:02.524
- A military man.
- A good man.

01:05:17.705 --> 01:05:19.331
Mr. Wei.

01:05:19.332 --> 01:05:22.836
Yes, our buyer will be
arriving tomorrow morning.

01:05:23.378 --> 01:05:24.837
He'll be terribly disappointed

01:05:24.838 --> 01:05:28.763
when I tell him there's
problems with our deal.

01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:33.011
Won't the little one be enough?

01:05:33.012 --> 01:05:34.847
Scratch Roberta's itch?

01:05:34.848 --> 01:05:37.516
I'm not sure if his
interest would dip so low.

01:05:37.517 --> 01:05:40.686
Perhaps not, but... if they do?

01:05:40.687 --> 01:05:42.521
We'll decide in the morning.

01:05:42.522 --> 01:05:45.023
Okay. So...

01:05:45.024 --> 01:05:46.775
I'll bring her in the morning.

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:48.493
Yes.

01:06:16.264 --> 01:06:18.724
Tell me the truth and
I won't hurt you.

01:06:18.725 --> 01:06:21.569
Where is Mya?

01:06:22.145 --> 01:06:23.770
I don't know.

01:06:23.771 --> 01:06:25.523
You don't know.

01:06:33.907 --> 01:06:35.533
You want to take me to her?

01:06:42.248 --> 01:06:45.217
Okay, where can I find Chen?

01:06:46.085 --> 01:06:48.795
I can't tell you.

01:06:48.796 --> 01:06:51.840
If he finds out I sent you
to him, he'll kill me.

01:06:51.841 --> 01:06:54.635
Okay, well, I'll kill you
a lot fucking worse.

01:06:54.636 --> 01:06:57.262
And I'm a lot better
at it than he is.

01:06:57.263 --> 01:06:58.805
If I'm dead, you're dead!

01:06:58.806 --> 01:07:00.599
Those girls are dead!

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.601
I don't mind.

01:07:02.602 --> 01:07:04.978
I don't mind if everybody dies,

01:07:04.979 --> 01:07:08.440
but I will kill you really slowly.

01:07:08.441 --> 01:07:11.364
Now where is Mya?

01:07:14.531 --> 01:07:17.875
I guess it's gonna be a
long, painful night.

01:07:32.298 --> 01:07:34.967
This is a very very
special compound,

01:07:34.968 --> 01:07:37.766
but it's gonna be slow
and fucking painful.

01:07:46.646 --> 01:07:50.116
There will be no more
fucking around with you.

01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:54.112
You want to tell me,
or you wanna die?

01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:56.822
Either way is fine
with me at this point.

01:07:56.823 --> 01:07:58.824
I really don't give a fuck.

01:07:58.825 --> 01:08:00.909
Okay, I'll talk, I'll
talk, I'll talk.

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:02.502
Talk.

01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:04.955
I'll bring you there.

01:08:04.956 --> 01:08:07.675
- I'll bring you to Mr. Chen.
- You'll bring me there? Perfect.

01:08:08.501 --> 01:08:10.799
Get ready. We're going now.

01:08:19.886 --> 01:08:21.809
Hey.

01:08:24.183 --> 01:08:26.143
Dude, what do you want?

01:08:26.144 --> 01:08:29.363
I already said everything
I gotta say to the cops.

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:32.608
Am I under arrest?

01:08:32.609 --> 01:08:34.401
My friend...

01:08:34.402 --> 01:08:36.779
what for?

01:08:46.205 --> 01:08:48.298
Chess?

01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:54.591
- What is your name?
- Alexander.

01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:57.131
And you're here for
the little girl?

01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:58.680
Yeah.

01:08:59.218 --> 01:09:00.594
What is your business?

01:09:00.595 --> 01:09:02.304
When you say, "what
is my business,"

01:09:02.305 --> 01:09:04.389
you mean, what do I
do for a living?

01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:07.809
- Yes.
- I'm a handyman.

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:10.062
A handyman?

01:09:10.604 --> 01:09:12.397
Well, Mr. Handyman,

01:09:12.398 --> 01:09:14.983
I have good news and bad news.

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:18.328
The good news is I
do have the girl.

01:09:18.904 --> 01:09:20.572
The bad news is I need her

01:09:20.573 --> 01:09:23.075
for another business transaction.

01:09:23.076 --> 01:09:26.203
Well, that's a shame, because...

01:09:26.746 --> 01:09:28.830
I came here to make
a deal with you,

01:09:28.831 --> 01:09:31.457
and any good businessman
would always hear

01:09:31.459 --> 01:09:33.335
what another man has to say.

01:09:33.336 --> 01:09:35.504
I'm prepared to throw money down.

01:09:35.505 --> 01:09:37.631
How much money are
we talking about?

01:09:37.631 --> 01:09:40.300
- How much you want?
- How about a million?

01:09:40.301 --> 01:09:45.055
A million? How about
300,000 cash, right now?

01:09:49.102 --> 01:09:51.229
That's a good number.

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:57.150
I tell you what: you
come back tomorrow,

01:09:57.151 --> 01:10:00.621
bring your money and we
can do some business.

01:10:25.972 --> 01:10:27.973
What happened?

01:10:27.974 --> 01:10:30.442
They took her.

01:10:35.314 --> 01:10:37.942
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

01:10:38.484 --> 01:10:40.152
'Cause now...

01:10:40.153 --> 01:10:43.657
I will snatch every
motherfucker birthday.

01:11:07.889 --> 01:11:10.357
Oh, fuck.

01:11:28.701 --> 01:11:30.748
Shit.

01:12:22.421 --> 01:12:23.964
Camera 4 is not working.

01:12:23.965 --> 01:12:25.590
I don't get a signal too.

01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:27.388
No signal.

01:12:43.901 --> 01:12:45.744
Reboot the system.

01:13:07.133 --> 01:13:08.383
Three men...

01:13:08.384 --> 01:13:10.802
two getting out of a limo,

01:13:10.803 --> 01:13:14.014
one guarding the gate
that's in the driveway.

01:13:14.015 --> 01:13:17.268
Looks like your tip might
actually be worth the trip.

01:13:23.024 --> 01:13:24.491
Still down.

01:13:26.694 --> 01:13:29.697
Pavel will be pissed
if something's wrong.

01:13:59.018 --> 01:14:01.853
Okay, let me hear
your theory again,

01:14:01.854 --> 01:14:04.606
'cause you're drawing a
lot of conclusions here.

01:14:04.607 --> 01:14:06.950
Okay, so what do we know so far?

01:14:07.485 --> 01:14:09.527
Chinese guy with a sword.

01:14:09.528 --> 01:14:12.864
"Gwai Lo." "White ghost."

01:14:12.865 --> 01:14:14.787
Maybe not.

01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:17.836
Dead Russians.

01:14:18.704 --> 01:14:21.627
And who's the big dog
in town these days?

01:14:22.917 --> 01:14:25.543
Mr. Chen, the Chinese arms dealer.

01:14:25.544 --> 01:14:27.337
Okay.

01:14:27.338 --> 01:14:30.882
And we got nothing connecting
Mr. Chen to the murders.

01:14:30.883 --> 01:14:34.052
Hear me out. What if
Vladimir is laundering money

01:14:34.053 --> 01:14:37.222
- for a deal for Mr. Chen?
- No. No.

01:14:37.223 --> 01:14:39.015
You have nothing to prove that.

01:14:39.016 --> 01:14:43.111
What if our killer is
taking out Vladimir's men?

01:14:43.854 --> 01:14:45.522
Okay. Why?

01:14:45.523 --> 01:14:47.565
In order to prevent Mister...

01:14:47.566 --> 01:14:51.070
to prevent Vladimir
from paying Mr. Chen?

01:14:57.952 --> 01:14:59.749
Lena?

01:16:25.039 --> 01:16:27.007
Sasha.

01:16:29.335 --> 01:16:31.711
Are you okay? Are you okay?
Did they hurt you?

01:16:31.712 --> 01:16:33.759
- No.
- Okay.

01:16:58.531 --> 01:17:00.328
Come on.

01:17:04.370 --> 01:17:07.123
- This way, this way.
- Let's go.

01:17:19.552 --> 01:17:21.594
Easy.

01:17:21.595 --> 01:17:23.688
Easy easy.

01:17:24.765 --> 01:17:26.891
You really didn't give me
a choice, you know?

01:17:26.892 --> 01:17:29.477
- Pavel?
- I tried to steer you away,

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:31.396
but you wouldn't listen.
Talking all the time.

01:17:31.397 --> 01:17:34.696
- Talking all the time.
- You work for Vladimir?

01:17:35.234 --> 01:17:36.985
Are you kidding me? Huh?

01:17:36.986 --> 01:17:40.535
I work for Mr. Chen.

01:17:52.751 --> 01:17:56.546
- What?
- No, they're cops.

01:17:56.547 --> 01:17:59.674
Look, stay here until I come
back and get you, all right?

01:17:59.675 --> 01:18:01.342
- Okay.
- Don't move.

01:18:01.343 --> 01:18:03.186
Okay.

01:18:23.199 --> 01:18:25.283
Partner, you are...

01:18:25.284 --> 01:18:28.828
a real pain in the ass,

01:18:28.829 --> 01:18:33.379
but not anymore. Not anymore.

01:18:50.809 --> 01:18:52.435
No!

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:56.482
Watch out!

01:19:00.819 --> 01:19:03.287
Li Wei, go! Warn Mr. Chen!

01:19:40.651 --> 01:19:42.778
Sasha!

01:19:48.534 --> 01:19:49.867
Go, go, go. I'm okay, I'm okay.

01:19:49.868 --> 01:19:51.995
Go, I'm good, I'm good.

01:20:28.449 --> 01:20:30.742
Too bad you are unarmed now.

01:20:30.743 --> 01:20:33.291
I am, too. Come on. Come here.

01:20:44.256 --> 01:20:48.602
You know what? Let's
make this a fair fight.

01:24:11.088 --> 01:24:14.465
Roberto. See, unteachable.

01:24:14.466 --> 01:24:16.764
You're early, my friend.

01:24:17.511 --> 01:24:19.604
Bongiorno, Mr. Chen.

01:24:45.038 --> 01:24:48.374
You have caused me much
trouble, Sasha. Much trouble.

01:24:48.375 --> 01:24:50.752
I guess that's the cost
of doing business.

01:24:51.878 --> 01:24:53.838
You should have never come back.

01:24:53.839 --> 01:24:56.512
Sasha, be careful.

01:24:57.301 --> 01:24:59.474
Shoot him!

01:25:32.127 --> 01:25:34.962
Okay. Okay. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Stop, stop, stop.

01:25:34.963 --> 01:25:37.010
Give it to me. Give it to me.

01:25:37.549 --> 01:25:40.051
Lena. Lena. Come on.

01:25:41.386 --> 01:25:42.887
It's okay. It's okay.

01:25:42.888 --> 01:25:44.639
It's okay.

01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:46.562
I've got you. I've got you.

01:25:47.392 --> 01:25:48.768
My squad car is over there.

01:25:48.769 --> 01:25:51.522
I'll call it in, make
sure she's safe.

01:25:56.234 --> 01:25:58.407
Go. Finish this.

01:25:59.821 --> 01:26:01.781
- I'll be back.
- No.

01:26:01.782 --> 01:26:03.407
I'm gonna finish this.
I'm gonna finish this.

01:26:03.408 --> 01:26:04.575
I'll be back.

01:26:04.576 --> 01:26:06.077
It's okay. It's okay.

01:26:19.675 --> 01:26:21.717
Okay, I'll take her.

01:26:21.718 --> 01:26:25.017
I'll find another
to clean my money.

01:26:25.555 --> 01:26:27.227
Excellent.

01:26:43.824 --> 01:26:46.409
Not very spirited.

01:26:46.410 --> 01:26:49.038
Roberto, she's still young.

01:26:51.206 --> 01:26:53.925
Ah. This is true.

01:26:54.459 --> 01:26:56.586
Make her a Shirley Temple.

01:27:05.137 --> 01:27:06.889
What do you want?

01:27:08.724 --> 01:27:11.350
I have an appointment with Chen.

01:27:11.351 --> 01:27:13.686
I got some stuff in here for him.

01:27:13.687 --> 01:27:15.484
Show me.

01:27:25.449 --> 01:27:28.247
He's clean. Mr. Chen
is expecting him.

01:28:05.739 --> 01:28:08.783
Alexander, I've got Lena.
She's safe.

01:28:08.784 --> 01:28:10.451
Stay on the perimeter.

01:28:10.452 --> 01:28:11.911
Wait for my signal.

01:28:11.912 --> 01:28:13.459
All right, copy that.

01:28:45.946 --> 01:28:49.573
Well, Mr. Alexander.

01:28:49.574 --> 01:28:51.742
Oh, you could just
call me "Alexander."

01:28:51.743 --> 01:28:53.202
As you wish.

01:28:53.203 --> 01:28:55.162
But addressing someone
in the formal

01:28:55.163 --> 01:28:56.413
is much more...

01:28:56.414 --> 01:28:58.249
polite. Don't you think?

01:28:58.250 --> 01:29:00.417
Yeah, it's impressive. Yeah.

01:29:00.418 --> 01:29:04.843
Listen, the deal was $300,000,
and I brought the money.

01:29:05.382 --> 01:29:06.632
You know, it astounds me

01:29:06.633 --> 01:29:09.385
how a handyman got $300,000.

01:29:09.386 --> 01:29:11.178
How did you get so much?

01:29:11.179 --> 01:29:12.972
Well, that's kind of
none of your business,

01:29:12.973 --> 01:29:15.516
but the fact of the
matter is I got it,

01:29:15.517 --> 01:29:18.602
and we have a deal...

01:29:18.603 --> 01:29:21.272
$300,000 for Mya.

01:29:21.273 --> 01:29:22.773
She's right there.

01:29:22.774 --> 01:29:24.650
I'm here to take you home.

01:29:24.651 --> 01:29:27.119
Oh, about that...

01:29:27.779 --> 01:29:29.906
I changed my mind.

01:29:36.705 --> 01:29:38.831
I thought you were a man of honor.

01:29:38.832 --> 01:29:40.499
I thought you were
gonna keep your word.

01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:42.251
I thought we had a deal.

01:29:42.252 --> 01:29:46.213
No, no, no, no, no, we had
business... not yet a deal.

01:29:46.214 --> 01:29:48.257
But it's time to make a deal.

01:29:48.258 --> 01:29:51.510
I already told you she's
for another buyer,

01:29:51.511 --> 01:29:53.804
but her sister, however...

01:29:53.805 --> 01:29:56.056
how much would you pay for her?

01:29:56.057 --> 01:29:59.560
Let's say 300,000 maybe?

01:29:59.561 --> 01:30:01.353
But you see, the deal was for Mya.

01:30:01.354 --> 01:30:03.147
Then I guess we have no deal.

01:30:03.148 --> 01:30:06.242
Yeah, well, I got all
this money here.

01:30:06.818 --> 01:30:09.662
What you want me to do
with all this money?

01:30:10.196 --> 01:30:12.915
$300,000, all right here.

01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:18.370
You know, may I say

01:30:18.371 --> 01:30:19.997
either you are very brave

01:30:19.998 --> 01:30:22.333
or very naive for you
to come back here.

01:30:22.334 --> 01:30:24.126
Now, you didn't bring no firepower.

01:30:24.127 --> 01:30:26.503
If you did, we would've
honored our word.

01:30:26.504 --> 01:30:29.427
But you're nothing but a handyman.

01:30:29.966 --> 01:30:31.216
It'd be stupid for us

01:30:31.217 --> 01:30:33.844
just not to take that
money and kill you.

01:30:33.845 --> 01:30:35.220
I'm gonna give you one last chance

01:30:35.221 --> 01:30:37.189
to keep your word.

01:30:40.268 --> 01:30:43.354
You're gonna give
me one last chance?

01:30:43.355 --> 01:30:46.523
- That's what I said.
- In my house?

01:30:46.524 --> 01:30:49.197
With my people and my guns?

01:30:51.196 --> 01:30:52.868
Yeah.

01:31:07.587 --> 01:31:09.713
I lied, but that's what I do.

01:31:09.714 --> 01:31:11.557
I lie for a living.

01:31:12.717 --> 01:31:14.760
I got some bad news for you.

01:31:14.761 --> 01:31:18.731
See, I lie for a living, too.

01:31:19.224 --> 01:31:20.941
And guess what?

01:31:21.476 --> 01:31:23.811
I'm not a handyman.

01:31:23.812 --> 01:31:26.531
I'm a professional killer.

01:31:27.065 --> 01:31:29.408
I came here to kill you.

01:31:42.747 --> 01:31:45.215
You're Gwai Lo?

01:31:50.005 --> 01:31:51.927
That's the way it is.

01:35:07.452 --> 01:35:09.249
Sasha!

01:35:13.625 --> 01:35:15.626
Is this how you wanna go out?

01:35:15.627 --> 01:35:17.836
A man of war?

01:35:17.837 --> 01:35:20.590
A son of Guan Gong?

01:35:21.216 --> 01:35:22.716
Like this?

01:35:22.717 --> 01:35:26.470
Killing a child? This is not you.

01:35:26.471 --> 01:35:30.474
You look at the total summation

01:35:30.475 --> 01:35:32.818
of your whole life...

01:35:33.353 --> 01:35:35.696
and see your last breath.

01:35:36.898 --> 01:35:39.116
Is this it?

01:35:40.735 --> 01:35:42.737
Well said.

01:35:44.072 --> 01:35:47.115
All my life, I try to take
care of my han dais,

01:35:47.116 --> 01:35:49.326
honor Guan Gong,

01:35:49.327 --> 01:35:51.828
amassed wealth and power,

01:35:51.829 --> 01:35:54.373
but no one close would tell me

01:35:54.374 --> 01:35:57.969
it's by trickery and deceit.

01:36:00.129 --> 01:36:02.339
It took an adversary

01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:06.344
to show me the significance
of life and death.

01:36:08.513 --> 01:36:10.514
If we can resolve this

01:36:10.515 --> 01:36:13.985
by the code of Gong...

01:36:15.436 --> 01:36:17.153
as han dai...

01:36:17.689 --> 01:36:19.816
men of honor...

01:36:20.650 --> 01:36:22.652
by the sword...

01:36:23.528 --> 01:36:25.325
would you?

01:36:46.050 --> 01:36:48.218
Come here, come here.
Mya, Mya, get over here.

01:36:48.219 --> 01:36:49.811
Come here.

01:37:38.436 --> 01:37:41.314
Now I can die in peace...

01:37:46.694 --> 01:37:48.286
Yes.

01:38:00.375 --> 01:38:02.334
Come here.

01:38:02.335 --> 01:38:03.752
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:38:03.753 --> 01:38:05.675
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:38:15.306 --> 01:38:16.765
Are you sure this is what you want?

01:38:16.766 --> 01:38:19.268
There's nothing here
for her anymore.

01:38:19.811 --> 01:38:23.281
I don't want to lose you again.

01:38:24.816 --> 01:38:26.818
I don't want to lose
you either, squirt.

01:38:35.326 --> 01:38:37.411
I'm gonna give you this dog.

01:38:37.412 --> 01:38:40.040
He's a good dope dog.
That's where I got him.

01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:42.249
Are you sure you don't
wanna come with?

01:38:42.250 --> 01:38:44.668
Yeah, I'm sure. I'm retired.

01:38:44.669 --> 01:38:47.504
And if you're retired, you're
gonna need some company.

01:38:47.505 --> 01:38:49.714
You got any ideas?

01:38:49.715 --> 01:38:51.467
Yes.

01:38:52.593 --> 01:38:55.178
It's finally over. Hear me, kiddo?

01:38:55.179 --> 01:38:57.180
Don't forget to call me, yes?

01:38:57.181 --> 01:38:58.648
Yes.

01:39:10.194 --> 01:39:13.321
It's good to see you.
Take care, okay?

01:39:13.322 --> 01:39:14.990
- Mm-hmm.
- Talk to you soon.

01:39:14.991 --> 01:39:17.325
- Thanks for coming home.
- Of course.

01:39:17.326 --> 01:39:19.369
Oh, let me give this to you.

01:39:19.370 --> 01:39:22.840
It's good luck... from Mya.

01:39:24.709 --> 01:39:26.209
Never leave home without it.

01:39:26.210 --> 01:39:29.463
Okay. Thank you.

01:39:29.464 --> 01:39:31.261
Bye.

01:39:33.634 --> 01:39:35.556
Bye.

01:39:53.446 --> 01:39:54.905
All right.

01:39:54.906 --> 01:39:56.407
Help me walk him.

01:40:17.845 --> 01:40:19.938
Buckle up.

01:40:20.305 --> 01:40:26.479
