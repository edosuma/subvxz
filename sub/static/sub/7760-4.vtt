01:28.689 --> 01:30.591
- AAH! NO!

01:30.624 --> 01:32.760
- WHAT IS IT?

01:32.793 --> 01:36.397
- OH, I HAD THAT DREAM--
AGAIN.

01:36.430 --> 01:40.668
- THE MR. SPERM-DONOR PAGEANT?
WHO WON THIS TIME?

01:40.701 --> 01:42.136
- GUESS.

01:42.170 --> 01:44.272
- MAYBE IT'S
SOME KIND OF SIGN.

01:44.305 --> 01:47.808
- FUCK.

01:47.841 --> 01:51.345
I ALREADY TOLD YOU,
I WANT SOMEONE ELSE.

01:51.379 --> 01:52.513
- BUT WE AGREED
IT'S IMPORTANT

01:52.546 --> 01:54.248
OUR KIDS SHOULD HAVE
THE SAME PARENT.

01:54.282 --> 01:56.150
- WE DIDN'T AGREE IT SHOULD BE
THE SAME ASSHOLE.

01:56.184 --> 01:58.619
- FINE. WE'LL PULL A NAME
OUT OF A HAT.

01:58.652 --> 02:03.257
LET'S GET SOME SLEEP,
BEFORE THE ALARM GOES OFF.

02:03.291 --> 02:06.527
- LOOK, I KNOW HOW MUCH
HE MEANS TO YOU.

02:06.560 --> 02:10.764
HE ALWAYS HAS,
AND HE ALWAYS WILL.

02:10.798 --> 02:14.802
BUT HE DOESN'T MEAN
THE SAME TO ME.

02:18.939 --> 02:21.809
- TO EAT, OR NOT TO EAT?

02:21.842 --> 02:23.444
- TRY ONE.

02:23.477 --> 02:24.545
- YOU KNOW I'M TRYING
TO WATCH MY WEIGHT.

02:24.578 --> 02:27.815
- ONE'S NOT GOING TO KILL YOU.

02:27.848 --> 02:31.852
- ALL RIGHT.

OOH, GOD.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.699
MMM...

02:45.733 --> 02:47.801
JESUS! YOU SAID IT WASN'T
GOING TO KILL ME.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.203
WHAT THE HELL'S
IN THOSE THINGS?

02:49.237 --> 02:51.805

THAT'S ACTUALLY...

03:08.622 --> 03:10.991

LAST SATURDAY NIGHT."

03:11.024 --> 03:12.560
YEAH, GENIUS.

03:12.593 --> 03:13.894
- I DON'T CARE
WHAT HE'S DOING.

03:13.927 --> 03:16.230
I HAVE TO SEE HIM.
- I'M SORRY, BRIAN.

03:16.264 --> 03:17.231
UH, SHE INSISTED.

03:17.265 --> 03:18.432
- BRIAN, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

03:18.466 --> 03:19.733
THE SCHOOL JUST CALLED.

03:19.767 --> 03:21.569
PETER BROKE HIS ARM
AT SOCCER PRACTICE.

03:21.602 --> 03:24.738
- GARDNER...
MY SISTER, CLAIRE.

03:24.772 --> 03:27.308
- IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
HAVING A FAMILY CRISIS.

03:27.341 --> 03:29.310
I'M GOING TO LET YOU
SORT IT OUT.

03:29.343 --> 03:31.312
PLEASURE.
- THANK YOU.

03:31.345 --> 03:34.315
I HAVE TO GET TO
THE EMERGENCY ROOM RIGHT AWAY.

03:34.348 --> 03:35.616
- THEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- CAN YOU HELP ME?

03:35.649 --> 03:37.318
- CAN YOU LOOK AFTER JOHN?

03:37.351 --> 03:39.253
- IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,
I'M WORKING.

03:39.287 --> 03:41.522
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
TO DO WITH HIM.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.657
- STICK HIM IN A LOCKER
AT THE BUS STATION.

03:43.691 --> 03:45.659
YOU EVER HEARD OF A SITTER?

03:45.693 --> 03:47.528
- YOU EXPECT ME TO FIND SOMEONE
ON A MOMENT'S NOTICE

03:47.561 --> 03:48.529
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY?

03:48.562 --> 03:49.797
- LEAVE HIM WITH MOM.

03:49.830 --> 03:52.266
- MOM'S INDISPOSED.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.934
- IS SHE PASSED OUT DRUNK
ON THE FLOOR AGAIN?

03:53.967 --> 03:56.337
- BRIAN, PLEASE,
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

03:56.370 --> 03:58.939
- [sighs]
[video game beeps]

03:58.972 --> 04:01.375
HOW LONG WILL YOU BE?
- I DON'T KNOW,

04:01.409 --> 04:02.676
BUT I'LL CALL
AS SOON AS I HEAR.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.345
OKAY, YOU BEHAVE YOURSELF,
DO YOU HEAR ME?

04:04.378 --> 04:09.583
[game beeping]

04:14.422 --> 04:16.824
- YOU STILL A FAG?

04:16.857 --> 04:20.894
- HERE.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.396
HAVE ONE.

04:22.430 --> 04:24.532
HAVE TWO.

04:30.938 --> 04:33.541
[chuckles]

04:33.574 --> 04:34.975
- LOOK AT THAT
BONE STRUCTURE,

04:35.008 --> 04:37.445
THOSE ADORABLE SEASHELL EARS.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.947
AND HE'S INCREDIBLY TALENTED.

04:39.980 --> 04:42.916
- HE'S ONLY 19.
- WELL, ISN'T THAT A PLUS?

04:42.950 --> 04:44.518
FRESH, YOUNG SPERM?

04:44.552 --> 04:46.320
- TO ME, HE'S STILL A BABY.

04:46.354 --> 04:48.656
IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT
HAVING A BABY WITH A BABY.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.824
- OKAY.

04:50.858 --> 04:53.461
- BEN'S BRAINY AND BRAWNY.

04:53.494 --> 04:55.796
- I'D SAY HE'S
JUST ABOUT PERFECT,

04:55.829 --> 04:57.398
EXCEPT FOR ONE THING.

04:57.431 --> 05:00.834
- RIGHT.

05:00.868 --> 05:03.704
THERE'S ALWAYS TED.

05:03.737 --> 05:06.540
- AH, GOOD OLD RELIABLE TEDDY.

05:06.574 --> 05:08.976
- EMMETT?
- YOU TRY IT.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.878
- TEDDY!

05:16.016 --> 05:18.886
- WHAT IS THIS PLACE?
- IT'S CALLED A DINER.

05:18.919 --> 05:21.689
- HEY, BRI.
GET YOURSELF A NEW BOYFRIEND?

05:21.722 --> 05:23.957
- YEAH, HE'S EVEN YOUNGER
THAN THE LAST ONE!

05:23.991 --> 05:25.693
[laughter]

05:25.726 --> 05:27.428
- GOD, I HOPE NOBODY
SEES ME.

05:27.461 --> 05:31.432
- SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP.
- WHO'S THE CUTIE?

05:31.465 --> 05:33.367
- HE'S THE SPAWN OF SATAN
AND MY SISTER.

05:33.401 --> 05:36.036
- THOUGHT I RECOGNIZED
A FAMILY RESEMBLANCE.

05:36.069 --> 05:37.838
- BOTH SIDES.

05:37.871 --> 05:42.976
- IS SHE A DRAG QUEEN?

05:43.010 --> 05:45.012
- SO, WHAT CAN I GET YA,
HONEY?

05:45.045 --> 05:46.847
- I'M NOT EATING ANYTHING
IN HERE.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.349
- BRING HIM A BURGER
WITH EXTRA GROUND GLASS.

05:51.084 --> 05:52.986
- HEY.
- HEY.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.722
- I WANT TO GO TO THE ARCADE
IN THE MALL.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.624
I GO THERE EVERY DAY
AFTER SCHOOL.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.459
- DOES YOUR MAMA KNOW?
- SHE THINKS I'M

05:58.492 --> 05:59.493
AT CHOIR PRACTICE.

05:59.527 --> 06:02.463
BET YOU'D LIKE THAT.

06:02.496 --> 06:05.466
- WHAT'RE YOU DOING
WITH YOUR NEPHEW?

06:05.499 --> 06:06.900
- I'M BRAT-SITTING.

06:06.934 --> 06:08.469
- HI, JOHN.
I'M MICHAEL.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.070
I'M BRIAN'S FRIEND.
YOU REMEMBER ME?

06:10.103 --> 06:12.039
- NO.

06:12.072 --> 06:14.041
- WHY DON'T YOU BRING HIM
BY THE STORE?

06:14.074 --> 06:15.876
I HAVE A COMIC BOOK STORE,
IF YOU WANT TO COME BY.

06:15.909 --> 06:18.512
IT'S JUST DOWN THE STREET.

06:18.546 --> 06:21.615
- YOU GOT THE NEW AVENGERS?
- I GOT EVERYTHING.

06:21.649 --> 06:23.484
- WHY DON'T YOU DROP BY
AND CHECK IT OUT?

06:23.517 --> 06:25.653
I GIVE FREE SAMPLES.

06:25.686 --> 06:27.488
- CAN WE, UNCLE BRI?

06:27.521 --> 06:31.692
- ALL OF A SUDDEN,
WE'RE RELATED.

06:31.725 --> 06:35.796
- WASN'T THAT SWEET OF MICHAEL?
- YEAH, HE'S A REAL MENSCH.

06:37.965 --> 06:41.535
AND WOULDN'T GIVE US
ANY TROUBLE.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.042
- DO YOU WANT TO HAND ME
THAT LIGHT BULB, BABE?

06:49.076 --> 06:50.644
- CAN I HAVE THIS SPIDER-MAN
TOO?

06:50.678 --> 06:53.080
- MM-HMM.
- DON'T BE SO FUCKING GREEDY.

06:53.113 --> 06:54.948
HE'S ALREADY GIVEN YOU
A SHITLOAD.

06:54.982 --> 06:56.116
- IT'S YOURS.

06:56.149 --> 06:59.052
- WHAT DO YOU SAY?

06:59.086 --> 07:01.822
- THANKS, MIKE.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.524
- YOU TWO WANT A KID?

07:03.557 --> 07:06.126
- ACTUALLY, I HAVE GIVEN THAT
SERIOUS THOUGHT...

07:06.159 --> 07:08.829
BECAUSE THE STUDIES
SHOW THAT TWO MEN

07:08.862 --> 07:10.698
ARE EVERY BIT AS CAPABLE
OF RAISING A CHILD--

07:10.731 --> 07:13.100
- PSST.
I MEAN THIS ONE.

07:13.133 --> 07:15.569
COME ON.
- AW...I DON'T WANNA GO.

07:15.603 --> 07:16.837
- WE ALL HAVE TO GO SOMETIME.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.806
- STOP PULLING ME, ASSHOLE.

07:18.839 --> 07:20.708
GODDAMN FAG.

07:20.741 --> 07:23.243
- YOU WERE GREAT WITH HIM,
YOU KNOW THAT?

07:23.276 --> 07:25.613
- KIDS LOVE ME.
DON'T ASK ME WHY.

07:25.646 --> 07:28.682
- I DON'T HAVE TO.
- GOD, YOU'RE HARD!

07:28.716 --> 07:29.750
- YEAH, YOU TOO.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.118
- [clears throat]

07:31.151 --> 07:34.154
DO YOU HAVE THE NEW SUPERMAN?

07:34.187 --> 07:37.124
- YOU'RE LOOKING AT HIM.

07:37.157 --> 07:40.828
IT'S, UH, RIGHT OVER THERE.

07:40.861 --> 07:44.131
THOSE WORKOUTS HAVE REALLY BEEN
PAYING OFF.

07:44.164 --> 07:45.999
SO I'LL SEE YOU AT DINNER?

07:46.033 --> 07:49.770
- UH, I THOUGHT WOULD, UH,
HIT THE GYM TONIGHT...

07:49.803 --> 07:52.973
PUT IN SOME EXTRA TIME
ON MY CHEST AND STOMACH.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.775
- BUT I THOUGHT
WE MADE PLANS.

07:54.808 --> 07:57.244
- SO WE'LL CHANGE THEM.
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM, IS IT?

07:57.277 --> 08:01.849
- NO.

08:01.882 --> 08:04.184
NOT A PROBLEM.

08:08.055 --> 08:09.623
[opera music playing]

08:09.657 --> 08:12.726
- YOU'RE A WONDER.

08:12.760 --> 08:13.994
- I AM?

08:14.027 --> 08:15.128
- I'VE KNOWN YOU...
HOW LONG?

08:15.162 --> 08:16.263
FIVE, SIX YEARS?

08:16.296 --> 08:17.998
I HAD NO IDEA
YOU COULD COOK.

08:18.031 --> 08:20.601
- MMM, THAT'S BECAUSE I NEVER
HAD ANYONE TO COOK FOR.

08:20.634 --> 08:24.004
NOW THAT I DO,
YOU WON'T BELIEVE THE DELIGHTS

08:24.037 --> 08:26.640
I PLAN TO WHIP UP.

08:26.674 --> 08:30.611
- WELL, I CAN HARDLY WAIT...
FOR DESSERT.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.312
- HMM. MMM.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.047
JUST A MINUTE. I JUST--
I WANT TO CLEAN UP.

08:34.081 --> 08:36.183
- EVERYTHING'S
ALREADY CLEAN.

08:36.216 --> 08:38.051
THE KITCHEN'S PRACTICALLY
SPOTLESS.

08:38.085 --> 08:39.820
- WELL, YOU KNOW ME.

08:39.853 --> 08:43.290
CAN'T RELAX UNTIL
EVERYTHING'S IN ORDER.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.158
- GOD, WHEN I COOK,

08:45.192 --> 08:47.294
THE KITCHEN LOOKS LIKE
A HURRICANE HIT.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.830
- SORRY.
- OH.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.199
- WELL, THIS'LL JUST TAKE
A SECOND.

09:01.108 --> 09:02.943
THIS IS SO NICE.

09:02.976 --> 09:04.211
- MMM.

09:04.244 --> 09:06.113
- I WISH YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO GO.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.048
- WHO'S GOING ANYWHERE?

09:08.081 --> 09:11.852
- I MEAN...IT'S SO...

09:11.885 --> 09:13.587
INCONVENIENT,
YOU ALWAYS HAVING TO RUN

09:13.621 --> 09:15.656
BACK AND FORTH
TO YOUR PLACE.

09:15.689 --> 09:18.592
- WELL, SOMETIMES ONE DOES NEED
A FRESH PAIR OF UNDIES.

09:18.626 --> 09:19.993
- YEAH, BUT WOULDN'T IT BE
MORE PRACTICAL

09:20.027 --> 09:21.261
IF THE UNDIES CAME TO YOU,

09:21.294 --> 09:25.666
RATHER THAN YOU GOING
TO THE UNDIES?

09:25.699 --> 09:27.601
- TEDDY, ARE--
ARE YOU SAYING...

09:27.635 --> 09:30.203
- WHY NOT MOVE IN?

09:30.237 --> 09:32.606
- YOU--YOU MEAN...
- LIVE TOGETHER.

09:32.640 --> 09:33.874
SHACK UP.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.342
- "SHACK UP."

09:35.375 --> 09:38.712
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO HEAR
THOSE WORDS.

09:40.180 --> 09:42.616
BUT DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S TOO SOON?

09:42.650 --> 09:46.386
- YEAH.
PROBABLY RIGHT.

09:46.419 --> 09:47.955
I MEAN, WE'VE ONLY
KNOWN EACH OTHER HOW LONG?

09:47.988 --> 09:49.222
FIVE, SIX YEARS?

09:49.256 --> 09:51.091
WE SHOULD WAIT AT LEAST
ANOTHER FIVE MORE.

09:51.124 --> 09:52.993
- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.361
LOVING SOMEONE
AND LIVING TOGETHER

09:54.394 --> 09:55.763
ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.230
WHAT IF WE DRIVE EACH OTHER
CRAZY?

09:57.264 --> 10:01.869
- WELL...WON'T KNOW
UNLESS WE TRY.

10:01.902 --> 10:05.238
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

10:05.272 --> 10:08.041
- WELL, AS...

10:08.075 --> 10:10.711
LONG AS I WON'T BE
IN THE WAY.

10:10.744 --> 10:14.281
- HOW COULD YOU EVER BE
IN THE WAY?

10:19.152 --> 10:20.921
PUT THAT THERE.
- [laughs]

10:20.954 --> 10:23.223
- WON'T LEAVE A SPOT.

10:26.827 --> 10:29.763
- OKAY, GUS,
GIMME YOUR HAPPY FACE.

10:29.797 --> 10:33.934
NOW LET ME SEE YOUR...
SAD FACE?

10:33.967 --> 10:36.069
OOH, SAD FACE. MMM.

10:36.103 --> 10:39.406
- YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE REALLY GOOD WITH KIDS.

10:39.439 --> 10:42.743
- YEAH, GUS ADORES YOU.

10:42.776 --> 10:45.345
- THAT'S 'CAUSE I'M A PUSHOVER.
[grunts]

NEED THINGS,

22:36.689 --> 22:39.125
SO I'M PASSING THEM ON
TO YOU AND ETHAN

22:39.158 --> 22:41.628
FOR SAFEKEEPING.

22:46.633 --> 22:49.168
- HI, VIC.
- DETECTIVE HORVATH.

22:49.201 --> 22:52.939
SIS, YOUR DICK'S HERE.
- HEY!

22:52.972 --> 22:55.808
- HI, HONEY.
- HEYA, SWEETMEAT.

22:55.842 --> 22:58.878
- HETEROSEXUAL LOVE.

22:58.911 --> 23:01.714
YOU SEE, JUSTIN, THEY'RE NOT
THAT DIFFERENT FROM US.

23:01.748 --> 23:02.782
- I THOUGHT WE WERE ON
TOMORROW NIGHT.

23:02.815 --> 23:04.484
- WE ARE.

23:04.517 --> 23:07.487
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING I THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

23:07.520 --> 23:10.790
ONE OF YOUR LOST BOYS
IS IN TROUBLE.

23:10.823 --> 23:13.192
- WHICH ONE?
- KINNEY.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.193
- BRIAN?

23:14.226 --> 23:16.095
SOMETHING HAPPEN TO BRIAN?

23:16.128 --> 23:18.631
- IT SEEMS
HIS 12-YEAR-OLD NEPHEW

23:18.665 --> 23:21.968
HAS ACCUSED HIM
OF MOLESTING HIM.

23:22.001 --> 23:23.670
- HOLY SHIT.
- THAT'S BULLSHIT.

23:23.703 --> 23:25.638
THERE'S NO WAY BRIAN
WOULD EVER DO

23:25.672 --> 23:27.674
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
- HAS HE BEEN ARRESTED?

23:27.707 --> 23:29.576
- SO FAR THEY'RE
JUST QUESTIONING HIM.

23:29.609 --> 23:31.444
- BRIAN MAY BE
A LOT OF THINGS,

23:31.478 --> 23:33.045
AND I'M THE FIRST ONE
TO SAY SO,

23:33.079 --> 23:36.649
BUT HE IS NO CHILD MOLESTER.

23:36.683 --> 23:38.084
[dance music]

23:38.117 --> 23:41.087
- [grunting rhythmically]

23:41.120 --> 23:43.122
*

23:43.155 --> 23:46.793
- * ONE BY ONE,
DEFENSES FALL *

23:46.826 --> 23:50.229
* ONE BY ONE,
YOU'RE MINE *

23:50.262 --> 23:51.798
* ONE BY ONE

23:51.831 --> 23:55.001
- OW!

23:55.034 --> 24:00.540
- * ONE BY ONE,
YOU'RE MINE *

24:00.573 --> 24:03.676
- WELCOME HOME, HONEY.
HOW WAS WORK?

24:03.710 --> 24:05.578
- OH, THE USUAL.

24:05.612 --> 24:08.815
ORGY, GANG RAPE, ENEMA-THON.

24:08.848 --> 24:10.216
- YOU MUST BE EXHAUSTED.

24:10.249 --> 24:11.818
- YEAH, WELL...

24:11.851 --> 24:13.720
GOT TO KEEP GIVING
THOSE WEBSITE MEMBERS

24:13.753 --> 24:16.756
THE KIND OF HIGH-QUALITY
ENTERTAINMENT THEY DESERVE.

24:16.789 --> 24:20.560
- * ONE BY ONE,
YOU'RE MINE *

24:20.593 --> 24:22.829
- HEY.

24:22.862 --> 24:24.897
SO WHAT'S ALL THIS?

24:24.931 --> 24:27.500
- MY AUNT LULAH'S
BILOXI-BATTERED CHICKEN.

24:27.534 --> 24:29.769
SHE USED TO SAY SHE COULD
DEEP-FAT-FRY A HORSE APPLE,

24:29.802 --> 24:31.638
AND THEY'D COME RUNNING.

24:31.671 --> 24:35.775
- [chuckles]

24:35.808 --> 24:37.844
AH, WELL, I GUESS
I'M JUST GOING TO GO

24:37.877 --> 24:41.581
WASH MY HANDS.

24:41.614 --> 24:44.517
- OH, BY THE WAY, I HUNG
A FEW THINGS UP IN THERE TO DRY.

24:48.020 --> 24:49.922
- I SEE.

24:49.956 --> 24:52.024
- WHY DON'T YOU SIT DOWN
AND PUT YOUR FEET UP, HONEY?

24:52.058 --> 24:54.293
DIN-DIN BE READY
IN A MIN-MIN!

24:54.326 --> 24:59.031
- RIGHT.

24:59.065 --> 25:01.634
- WHAT--WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE LIVING ROOM?

25:01.668 --> 25:05.171
- OH, I-I FENG SHUI-ED IT.

25:05.204 --> 25:08.541
DO YOU LIKE IT?

25:08.575 --> 25:11.911
- WELL, IT REALLY
GIVES THE ROOM A FLOW.

25:27.994 --> 25:30.797
UH, MY NAIL.

25:30.830 --> 25:32.031
- WHAT, TEDDY?

25:32.064 --> 25:34.667
- THERE WAS A BENT NAIL
RIGHT THERE.

25:34.701 --> 25:37.303
- WHAT,
THAT RUSTY, OLD THING?

25:37.336 --> 25:39.972
- YEAH, YEAH, THAT RUSTY,
OLD THING, WHERE IS IT?

25:40.006 --> 25:42.842
- WELL,
WHILE I WAS FENG SHUI-ING,

25:42.875 --> 25:44.110
IT FELL ON THE FLOOR.

25:44.143 --> 25:45.678
YOU KNOW HOW DANGEROUS
THAT WOULD BE

25:45.712 --> 25:47.079
IF YOU STEPPED ON THAT
IN YOUR BARE FEET?

25:47.113 --> 25:48.347
YOU'D NEED A TETANUS SHOT.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.982
- YEAH, WHAT DID YOU
DO WITH IT?

25:50.016 --> 25:54.053
- I THREW IT OUT.

25:54.086 --> 25:55.988
IT'S JUST AN OLD NAIL.

25:56.022 --> 25:57.824
- IT'S NOT JUST AN OLD NAIL.

25:57.857 --> 26:00.860
IT'S PAVAROTTI'S OLD NAIL.

26:00.893 --> 26:02.328
BEFORE EVERY PERFORMANCE,

26:02.361 --> 26:03.663
HE HAS TO FIND A BENT NAIL
BACKSTAGE FOR GOOD LUCK.

26:03.696 --> 26:05.064
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

26:05.097 --> 26:07.066
THE NIGHT HE WAS IN TOWN
PERFORMING TURANDOT

26:07.099 --> 26:09.268
AT THE PITTSBURGH OPERA,
HE FOUND THAT NAIL,

26:09.301 --> 26:11.704
PICKED IT UP, KISSED IT,
THREW IT OVER HIS SHOULDER,

26:11.738 --> 26:13.205
AND I PICKED IT UP.

26:13.239 --> 26:15.007
IT'S BEEN MY GOOD LUCK CHARM
EVER SINCE.

26:15.041 --> 26:18.678
NOW IT'S JUST GONE?

26:18.711 --> 26:20.847
- I DIDN'T KNOW.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.381
[music clicks off]

26:22.414 --> 26:23.883
I'M SORRY.

26:23.916 --> 26:25.818
- WELL, YOU HAD NO RIGHT
TOUCHING IT.

26:25.852 --> 26:27.353
YOU HAD NO RIGHT
TOUCHING ANYTHING!

26:27.386 --> 26:28.821
YOU KNOW, I WOULD APPRECIATE
IT IF YOU JUST PUT

26:28.855 --> 26:30.289
EVERYTHING BACK
THE WAY YOU FOUND IT,

26:30.322 --> 26:31.824
AND THAT INCLUDES REMOVING

26:31.858 --> 26:33.626
YOUR DRIPPING SHORTS
FROM MY BATHROOM.

26:33.660 --> 26:36.395
- YOUR BATHROOM?

26:36.428 --> 26:40.099
I'M SORRY, I THOUGHT
IT WAS OUR BATHROOM.

26:40.132 --> 26:44.971
IN FACT, I THOUGHT
THIS WAS OUR PLACE.

26:45.004 --> 26:50.276
APPARENTLY NOT.

26:50.309 --> 26:55.181
WELL, LIKE YOU SAID, HAVE
TO FIND OUT SOONER OR LATER

26:55.214 --> 26:58.417
WHETHER OR NOT
WE COULD LIVE TOGETHER.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.653
BETTER TO HAVE FOUND OUT
SOONER.

27:03.890 --> 27:05.391
[door shuts]

27:05.424 --> 27:08.127
- HE TOLD THEM
YOU MADE HIM SUCK YOUR COCK?

27:08.160 --> 27:10.997
- THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD
MY CUNT-SISTER.

27:11.030 --> 27:12.765
THAT'S WHAT MY CUNT-SISTER
TOLD THE COPS.

27:12.799 --> 27:14.934
- I GAVE THAT LITTLE ASSHOLE
FREE COMICS.

27:14.967 --> 27:17.136
THEY DON'T BELIEVE HIM,
DO THEY?

27:17.169 --> 27:19.271
- LISTEN UP, MICHAEL.
ARE YOU LISTENING?

27:19.305 --> 27:21.140
- I'M LISTENING.
- THEY'RE HETEROSEXUALS.

27:21.173 --> 27:23.409
THEY THINK ALL US PERVERTS
ARE AFTER ONLY ONE THING:

27:23.442 --> 27:27.146
TO GET OUR HANDS ON SOME
SWEET PIECE OF LITTLE BOY MEAT.

27:27.179 --> 27:28.447
- SO ALL HE HAS TO DO
IS ACCUSE YOU,

27:28.480 --> 27:30.016
AND THEY AUTOMATICALLY
BELIEVE HIM?

27:30.049 --> 27:31.350
- I DUNNO, BUT NOW I HAVE
TO USE THE MONEY

27:31.383 --> 27:33.019
I WAS GOING TO SPEND
ON MY BOTOX TREATMENTS

27:33.052 --> 27:35.922
ON SOME GODDAMN
$300-AN-HOUR LAWYER.

27:35.955 --> 27:37.924
- THEY'RE NOT GOING
TO ARREST YOU, ARE THEY?

27:37.957 --> 27:39.926
- HOW DO I KNOW?
GIVE ME...

27:39.959 --> 27:43.195
- SHIT, YOU COULD GO TO PRISON!
[keys jingling]

27:43.229 --> 27:45.197
- DON'T GET YOURSELF
ALL WORKED UP.

27:45.231 --> 27:46.465
- I'M HALF ITALIAN
AND HALF DRAG-QUEEN.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.167
I'M ALLOWED
TO GET WORKED UP.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.236
WELL,
YOU CAN'T JUST WAIT AROUND

27:50.269 --> 27:53.940
FOR THEM TO COME
AND TAKE YOU AWAY.

27:53.973 --> 27:57.910
- I DON'T INTEND TO.
[tires squealing]

27:57.944 --> 28:00.880
[doorbell rings]

28:04.984 --> 28:07.053
- OH, SHIT.
- OPEN THE DOOR.

28:07.086 --> 28:08.921
- GO AWAY OR I'LL CALL
THE POLICE, YOU SON OF A BITCH.

28:08.955 --> 28:12.792
- I SAID
OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!

28:12.825 --> 28:16.228
WHERE IS HE?
- GET OUT OF HERE, BRIAN!

28:16.262 --> 28:19.265
- [laughs]

28:19.298 --> 28:20.466
JOHN!

28:20.499 --> 28:22.735
GET YOUR ASS DOWN HERE,
YOU LITTLE FUCK.

28:22.769 --> 28:23.936
- WHAT, YOU THINK
I'M GOING TO LET YOU

28:23.970 --> 28:25.938
GO NEAR HIM,
YOU SICK PERVERT?

28:25.972 --> 28:28.207
[sirens wailing]

28:28.240 --> 28:32.511
- YOU THINK I ACTUALLY
MOLESTED YOUR SON?

28:32.544 --> 28:35.748
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE IF YOU HAD ASKED ME

28:35.782 --> 28:38.017
BEFORE YOU CALLED THE COPS...
- WHY SHOULD I?

28:38.050 --> 28:39.819
AND WHY WOULD HE MAKE IT UP?

28:39.852 --> 28:42.955
- BECAUSE YOUR KID IS A TWISTED,
FAG-HATING LIAR, CLAIRE.

28:42.989 --> 28:48.527
THAT'S WHY.
WHO'D HE LEARN THAT FROM?

28:48.560 --> 28:49.862
OH.

28:49.896 --> 28:51.964
ENTER MOM, STAGE LEFT.

28:51.998 --> 28:54.967
- YOU HAVE A HELL OF A NERVE,
SHOWING YOUR FACE.

28:55.001 --> 28:56.836
- AH.
NICE TO SEE YOU TOO.

28:56.869 --> 28:58.270
WHAT?
DON'T I GET A KISS?

28:58.304 --> 29:00.306
- STAY AWAY FROM ME.
- DON'T WORRY.

29:00.339 --> 29:02.041
YOU'RE NOT MY TYPE.
- GOD ONLY KNOWS

29:02.074 --> 29:03.509
WHAT PERMANENT DAMAGE
YOU'VE DONE TO HIM.

29:03.542 --> 29:05.044
- WHAT?
THAT YOU HAVEN'T DONE ALREADY?

29:05.077 --> 29:06.278
- YOU OUGHT TO BE LOCKED UP.
PUT AWAY.

29:06.312 --> 29:08.848
- THANKS, OLD SPORT.
[glass clinks]

29:08.881 --> 29:10.382
HAVE ANOTHER.

29:10.416 --> 29:12.451
- AND IF I HAVE ANYTHING
TO SAY ABOUT IT, YOU WILL BE.

29:12.484 --> 29:15.521
- HOW COULD YOU?
- HOW COULD I WHAT?

29:15.554 --> 29:20.126
MAKE LITTLE JOHNNY
SUCK MY DICK?

29:20.159 --> 29:23.262
I'M GOING TO FIND YOU,
YOU LITTLE SACK OF SHIT!

29:23.295 --> 29:25.898
AND THIS TIME, YOU WON'T BE
COMING UP FOR AIR!

29:25.932 --> 29:27.166
- DID YOU HEAR THAT,
MOTHER?

29:27.199 --> 29:29.035
HE JUST THREATENED HIM!

29:29.068 --> 29:30.036
I'M CALLING THE POLICE.

29:30.069 --> 29:31.270
- GO AHEAD, SIS.

29:31.303 --> 29:34.540
TELL 'EM
I'M A DEPRAVED MONSTER.

29:34.573 --> 29:36.442
A GODLESS FAG, RIGHT, MOM?

29:36.475 --> 29:37.877
- IF YOU THINK
YOU'RE GETTING A REACTION

29:37.910 --> 29:39.545
FROM ME, YOU'RE NOT.

29:39.578 --> 29:43.449
HOWEVER, I WILL SAY, KNOWING
THE KIND OF LIFE YOU LIVE,

29:43.482 --> 29:47.286
THE TYPE OF PEOPLE
YOU ASSOCIATE WITH,

29:47.319 --> 29:50.056
I'M NOT SURPRISED.

29:50.089 --> 29:55.427
IT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU
TURN YOUR BACK ON THE LORD.

29:55.461 --> 29:58.330
- FUCK THE LORD.

30:02.334 --> 30:05.972
AND FUCK YOU.

30:17.884 --> 30:20.386
- I TOLD MY MOM
NOT TO GET HER HOPES UP,

30:20.419 --> 30:23.956
AND THEN SHE HAS TO GO
AND TELL EVERYBODY.

30:23.990 --> 30:25.925
NOW SHE'LL PROBABLY BE
ALL DISAPPOINTED

30:25.958 --> 30:28.360
AND MOPE AROUND FOR DAYS.

30:30.997 --> 30:33.332
- GOOD THING
YOU'RE NOT LIKE HER.

30:33.365 --> 30:36.068
- YEAH.

30:36.102 --> 30:37.937
- [chuckles]

30:37.970 --> 30:40.206
OH, IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION,

30:40.239 --> 30:41.640
I'M DISAPPOINTED TOO.

30:41.673 --> 30:45.411
I WAS LOOKING FORWARD
TO BEING UNCLE BEN.

30:45.444 --> 30:48.080
- LIKE THE RICE.

30:48.114 --> 30:50.883
- PROBABLY THE CLOSEST
I'LL EVER COME TO BEING A DAD.

30:55.654 --> 30:58.224
- I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WANTED TO BE ONE.

30:58.257 --> 30:59.391
- IT WAS ALWAYS A THOUGHT,
BUT I NEVER KNEW

30:59.425 --> 31:01.928
HOW MUCH I WANTED IT

31:01.961 --> 31:02.962
UNTIL I COULDN'T.

31:02.995 --> 31:06.098
[door opens]

31:06.132 --> 31:08.534
- SHIT.

31:08.567 --> 31:12.538
THERE'S SOMEBODY
IN THE APARTMENT.

31:12.571 --> 31:18.177
[shuffling]

31:18.210 --> 31:20.446
JESUS, EM.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

31:20.479 --> 31:23.015
WHAT ARE YOU DOING BACK?

31:24.450 --> 31:26.685
- BRIAN WAS RIGHT.

31:26.718 --> 31:30.289
GOOD THING
I SAVED THE BOXES.

31:36.562 --> 31:39.465
[dance music]

31:39.498 --> 31:47.439
*

31:52.211 --> 31:55.681
[laughter]

31:55.714 --> 31:59.285
*

31:59.318 --> 32:04.290
- * DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN RESCUE ME ?

32:04.323 --> 32:07.026
* RESCUE ME,
RESCUE ME *

32:07.059 --> 32:08.227
- HEY, WHERE'S YOUR WIFE?

32:08.260 --> 32:11.163
- SHE WENT HOME TO HER MOTHER.

32:11.197 --> 32:12.698
- LESS THAN 24 HOURS?

32:12.731 --> 32:15.334
WOW, IT SURPASSED
EVEN MY OWN PREDICTIONS.

32:15.367 --> 32:16.735
- CONGRATULATIONS,
YOU MUST FEEL

32:16.768 --> 32:19.205
AN OVERWHELMING SENSE
OF SATISFACTION.

32:19.238 --> 32:20.973
- NAH, WHAT I FEEL IS

32:21.007 --> 32:23.175
AN OVERWHELMING SENSE
OF DISGUST,

32:23.209 --> 32:26.045
SEEING TWO PATHETIC FAGS
TRYING TO TURN THEMSELVES

32:26.078 --> 32:27.479
INTO SOMETHING
EVEN MORE PATHETIC:

32:27.513 --> 32:30.716
TWO HAPPILY MARRIED
HETEROSEXUALS.

32:30.749 --> 32:34.486
- IT'S GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

32:34.520 --> 32:36.255
YOU KNOW, IT'S GOT TO DO
WITH SOMETHING

32:36.288 --> 32:39.525
US LOWER LIFE FORMS
GENERALLY REFER TO AS "LOVE."

32:39.558 --> 32:41.327
JUST BECAUSE YOU
CAN'T COMPREHEND THAT

32:41.360 --> 32:43.195
DOESN'T MEAN THE REST OF US
SHOULD BE CONDEMNED

32:43.229 --> 32:46.498
TO LIVE OUT OUR LIVES
IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT,

32:46.532 --> 32:50.069
OUR HEARTS BANISHED TO ONE
OF JUPITER'S ICE MOONS.

32:50.102 --> 32:53.272
- WHOA, THAT WAS VERY POETIC

32:53.305 --> 32:55.541
FOR A FORMER ACCOUNTANT.

32:55.574 --> 32:57.276
I SINCERELY HOPE
YOU FIND THE DREAM

32:57.309 --> 32:59.078
THAT SATISFIES
YOUR EXISTENCE.

32:59.111 --> 33:02.281
BUT UNTIL THEN, WHY DON'T YOU
LET ME BUY YOU A DRINK?

33:02.314 --> 33:06.218
- FUCK OFF.

33:06.252 --> 33:07.553
- THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

33:07.586 --> 33:13.125
*

33:13.159 --> 33:15.094
- YEAH. YEAH.

33:15.127 --> 33:18.664
YEAH.

33:21.567 --> 33:23.535
- HEY.
- HEY.

33:34.680 --> 33:37.449
YOU'RE A LITTLE YOUNG
FOR ME.

33:37.483 --> 33:40.152
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I HEARD.

33:42.488 --> 33:45.424
[arcade hubbub]

34:01.173 --> 34:03.342
- YEAH, MOTHERFUCKERS, DIE.

34:03.375 --> 34:04.743
[gunfire]

34:04.776 --> 34:06.578
- HOW'S CHOIR PRACTICE?

34:06.612 --> 34:09.415
- WHO ARE YOU?
- I'M A FRIEND OF YOUR UNCLE'S.

34:09.448 --> 34:11.417
- ANOTHER FAG?

34:11.450 --> 34:14.153
GET AWAY FROM ME
OR I'LL CALL THE POLICE.

34:14.186 --> 34:16.322
- WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO TELL 'EM?

34:16.355 --> 34:18.357
THAT I MADE YOU
SUCK ME OFF TOO?

34:18.390 --> 34:20.692
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?
- I WANT THE TRUTH.

34:20.726 --> 34:22.561
- I ALREADY TOLD THE TRUTH.

34:22.594 --> 34:25.097
HE OFFERED ME MONEY,
BUT I WOULDN'T DO IT.

34:25.131 --> 34:26.465
DID HE OFFER YOU MONEY TOO?

34:26.498 --> 34:28.700
- HA.
HE DIDN'T HAVE TO.

34:28.734 --> 34:30.436
I WOULD'VE PAID HIM.

34:30.469 --> 34:32.871
IF YOU DON'T ADMIT
THAT YOU'RE LYING,

34:32.904 --> 34:35.307
THAT YOU MADE ALL OF THIS UP,
BRIAN COULD GO TO JAIL.

34:35.341 --> 34:39.378
- GOOD, THEN HE'D GET RAPED
BY A GANG OF BLACK GUYS.

34:39.411 --> 34:43.449
- YOUR MOTHER
MUST SUBSCRIBE TO HBO.

34:43.482 --> 34:46.718
- WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?
GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME!

34:46.752 --> 34:49.621
- THAT'S A COOL BRACELET.

34:53.692 --> 34:56.462
- MAYBE THE TERMS OF
THE AGREEMENT WERE A BIT HARSH.

34:56.495 --> 34:58.464
- I WAS ONLY TRYING
TO PROTECT US.

34:58.497 --> 35:00.199
- BUT MICHAEL'S NOT BRIAN.

35:00.232 --> 35:01.767
THAT'S WHY WE CHOSE HIM
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.902
- I SAY WE GET A GENIUS
FROM THE SPERM BANK.

35:03.935 --> 35:06.605
IT'S EASIER.
- FOR WHO, MEL? OUR KID?

35:06.638 --> 35:09.208
NEVER KNOWING ITS DAD,
EXCEPT BY A NUMBER?

35:09.241 --> 35:11.810
- I'M NOT HAVING A REPEAT OF
WHAT WE WENT THROUGH WITH BRIAN.

35:11.843 --> 35:14.146
- I JUST SAID
MICHAEL'S NOT BRIAN.

35:14.180 --> 35:15.647
ARE YOU EVEN LISTENING
TO ME?

35:15.681 --> 35:17.883
- BABY, THE ENTIRE STREET'S
LISTENING TO YOU.

35:17.916 --> 35:21.620
- IT'S NOT ABOUT MICHAEL
OR WHO THE FATHER WILL BE.

35:21.653 --> 35:24.356
IT'S ABOUT TRUST--
TRUSTING TO FATE,

35:24.390 --> 35:26.558
TRUSTING TO GOD,

35:26.592 --> 35:29.561
TO THE OB-GYN, THAT SOMEHOW
EVERYTHING WILL BE ALL RIGHT.

35:29.595 --> 35:31.363
NOW, IF YOU CAN'T ACCEPT THAT,

35:31.397 --> 35:33.299
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
A BABY.

35:33.332 --> 35:35.667
MAYBE WE SHOULD STOP
RIGHT NOW.

35:35.701 --> 35:38.637
- KEEP COMING.
KEEP COMING.

35:38.670 --> 35:40.672
LITTLE MORE.
A LITTLE BIT.

35:40.706 --> 35:44.510
- [sighs]

35:53.452 --> 35:57.256
[CD player shuts off]

35:57.289 --> 35:58.390
- WHAT'S UP?

35:58.424 --> 35:59.725
- HOW ABOUT YOU TELLING US?

35:59.758 --> 36:01.527
- LET ME HANDLE THIS,
DEBBIE.

36:01.560 --> 36:03.962
DETECTIVE CARL HORVATH,

36:03.995 --> 36:05.664
PITTSBURGH P.D.

36:05.697 --> 36:07.466
I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE
MADE SOME ALLEGATIONS

36:07.499 --> 36:10.869
RECENTLY REGARDING
YOUR UNCLE, BRIAN KINNEY.

36:10.902 --> 36:13.205
- HE MADE ME DO THINGS TO HIM.

36:13.239 --> 36:15.941
- THAT'S A PRETTY SERIOUS
CHARGE, SON, IF IT'S TRUE.

36:15.974 --> 36:17.543
- I'M NOT LYING.

36:17.576 --> 36:19.545
- HE SAID YOU MADE IT UP
BECAUSE HE FOUND YOU

36:19.578 --> 36:21.280
STEALING MONEY
FROM HIS WALLET.

36:21.313 --> 36:24.216
- HE'S THE LIAR.

36:24.250 --> 36:26.985
- YOU ALSO TOOK SOME KIND
OF BRACELET WITH SHELLS.

36:27.018 --> 36:29.688
- I DON'T HAVE
ANY STUPID BRACELET.

36:29.721 --> 36:31.590
- I SAW YOU WEARING IT TODAY
AT THE ARCADE.

36:31.623 --> 36:33.825
- WHY SHOULD ANYONE
BELIEVE YOU?

36:33.859 --> 36:35.227
- JOHN,
IS THAT THE BRACELET

36:35.261 --> 36:36.828
YOU HAD ON THIS MORNING
AT BREAKFAST?

36:36.862 --> 36:38.330
- MOM, WOULD YOU SHUT UP?

36:38.364 --> 36:39.898
- WELL, YOU SAID YOU GOT IT
AT THE MALL.

36:39.931 --> 36:42.768
- I BOUGHT IT
WITH MY ALLOWANCE

36:42.801 --> 36:45.571
AT THAT STORE
ACROSS FROM THE PET SHOP.

36:45.604 --> 36:47.873
- LET'S SEE THE BRACELET,
SON.

36:47.906 --> 36:49.508
- I DON'T HAVE IT.
I LOST IT.

36:49.541 --> 36:52.911
- [sighs]
SHOW IT TO HIM.

37:07.693 --> 37:10.596
- BRIAN GOT IT IN MEXICO.

37:10.629 --> 37:12.631
HIS INITIALS ARE CARVED
ON ONE OF THE SHELLS.

37:12.664 --> 37:13.999
- MM-HMM.

37:14.032 --> 37:16.668
- I WANT THE TRUTH, JOHN.

37:16.702 --> 37:18.504
NOW YOU TELL ME THE TRUTH.

37:18.537 --> 37:23.675
NOW DID BRIAN REALLY DO
WHAT YOU SAID HE DID?

37:23.709 --> 37:25.511
- HE'S A FAG,
LIKE YOU SAID.

37:25.544 --> 37:28.314
A GODDAMN FAG.

37:29.648 --> 37:32.784
- SHAME ON YOU.

37:39.558 --> 37:43.529
[door shuts]
BUT MOST OF ALL, SHAME ON YOU.

37:48.967 --> 37:50.702
- AND THIS HULK FROM 1988

37:50.736 --> 37:52.671
HAS A REALLY COOL BATTLE
WITH WOLVERINE

37:52.704 --> 37:55.574
AND SOME GREAT ART
BY TODD MACFARLANE.

38:00.879 --> 38:02.348
HI.
- HOPE WE DIDN'T COME

38:02.381 --> 38:03.649
AT A BAD TIME.

38:03.682 --> 38:05.651
- NO, I WAS JUST ADVISING
A COLLECTOR.

38:05.684 --> 38:08.654
HE'S ACTUALLY
ONE OF MY BEST CUSTOMERS.

38:08.687 --> 38:10.456
- THEN WE WON'T STAY
TOO LONG.

38:10.489 --> 38:12.057
MICHAEL,
ABOUT THE AGREEMENT--

38:12.090 --> 38:13.392
- LOOK,
I ALREADY TOLD YOU, I--

38:13.425 --> 38:15.394
- WE KNOW.

38:15.427 --> 38:17.463
THAT'S WHY WE DECIDED
TO AMEND

38:17.496 --> 38:22.434
SOME OF THE FINE POINTS.

38:22.468 --> 38:25.003
- PROVIDED YOU FULFILL
YOUR FUNCTION,

38:25.036 --> 38:29.441
YOU WILL HEREWITH
BE REFERRED TO AS THE FATHER.

38:33.979 --> 38:36.848
- SO WHAT DO YOU SAY, DAD?

38:41.587 --> 38:43.088
[laughter]

38:43.121 --> 38:47.993
- OH!
[laughter]

38:57.503 --> 39:00.606
- MIND IF I HAVE A DRINK?

39:00.639 --> 39:02.974
- NAME ON THE DOOR'S "WOODY'S,"
NOT "EMMETT'S."

39:03.008 --> 39:08.046
- GREY GOOSE AND TONIC.

39:08.079 --> 39:09.848
EM--
- SAVE YOUR BREATH.

39:09.881 --> 39:11.016
IT'S QUITE OBVIOUS
YOU AND I

39:11.049 --> 39:12.584
WERE NOT MEANT
TO LIVE TOGETHER.

39:12.618 --> 39:14.653
- LOOK, I'M SORRY
THAT I GOT UPSET.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.522
- UPSET?
TRY "WENT BALLISTIC."

39:16.555 --> 39:18.457
- JUST,
I'M KIND OF FINICKY...

39:18.490 --> 39:20.726
- FINICKY IS WHEN YOU TURN
YOUR NOSE UP AT FRISKIES.

39:20.759 --> 39:22.728
- WHEN IT COMES
TO MY THINGS.

39:22.761 --> 39:24.463
- AND WHY SHOULDN'T YOU BE,
HONEY?

39:24.496 --> 39:25.864
IT'S YOUR PLACE.

39:25.897 --> 39:27.466
SO, IN THE FUTURE,

39:27.499 --> 39:31.169
DON'T ASK SOMEONE
TO MOVE IN WITH YOU.

39:31.202 --> 39:32.938
- LOOK, AFTER YOU LEFT,

39:32.971 --> 39:35.140
I WALKED UP AND DOWN
LIBERTY AVENUE.

39:35.173 --> 39:36.475
I FINALLY ENDED UP
AT THE DINER

39:36.508 --> 39:37.909
WITH A STALE LEMON BAR

39:37.943 --> 39:39.611
AND A COPY OF LAST WEEK'S
PITTSBURGH OUT.

39:39.645 --> 39:41.079
HAVE YOU SEEN IT?

39:41.112 --> 39:42.881
- IS THE HEADLINE, "FINICKY
BOYFRIEND GOES BERSERK"?

39:42.914 --> 39:44.483
- ACTUALLY, THERE'S
AN INTERESTING LETTER

39:44.516 --> 39:46.752
TO "DEAR ABS"
IN HERE.

39:46.785 --> 39:48.520
- DON'T TELL ME YOU READ
THAT SILLY QUEEN.

39:48.554 --> 39:50.822
- GO ON.

39:55.694 --> 39:58.497
- "DEAR ABS, MY BOYFRIEND
JUST MOVED IN WITH ME,

39:58.530 --> 40:00.899
"AND HE'S TAKEN OVER.

40:00.932 --> 40:04.770
"HE EVEN MOVED THE LUBE
TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BED.

40:04.803 --> 40:09.641
HELP.
ATTA LOSS."

40:09.675 --> 40:12.143
SO?
- NOW HIS ANSWER.

40:14.880 --> 40:17.115
- "DEAR ATTA,

40:17.148 --> 40:20.051
"GET A NEW PLACE
THAT'S BOTH OF YOURS,

40:20.085 --> 40:23.922
"UNLESS YOU WANT
TO JACK OFF ALONE.

40:23.955 --> 40:26.725
"AND AS FOR THE LUBE,
I SUGGEST YOU LET

40:26.758 --> 40:29.461
YOUR BOYFRIEND
PUT IT WHEREVER HE WANTS."

40:32.598 --> 40:34.566
- NOW THERE MUST HAVE BEEN
A REASON I WAS READING THAT

40:34.600 --> 40:36.735
AT 2:00 IN THE MORNING.

40:36.768 --> 40:38.937
I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE YOU, EM,

40:38.970 --> 40:41.540
BUT THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN
LIVE TOGETHER AT MY PLACE.

40:41.573 --> 40:42.841
- YESTERDAY'S NEWS.

40:42.874 --> 40:46.678
- SO I SUGGEST
WE TAKE DEAR ABS' ADVICE

40:46.712 --> 40:48.747
AND GET OUR PLACE--

40:48.780 --> 40:52.083
A SPACE BIG ENOUGH FOR YOU
TO FENG SHUI YOUR HEART OUT

40:52.117 --> 40:55.721
AND FOR ME TO CLOSE THE DOOR
AND TRY AND HIT A HIGH "C"

40:55.754 --> 40:59.024
ALONG WITH PAVAROTTI
IF I WANT TO.

40:59.057 --> 41:04.095
IN FACT,
I WAS THINKING OF A HOUSE.

41:04.129 --> 41:06.097
- A HOUSE?

41:06.131 --> 41:08.834
- WITH A BACKYARD AND ROOMS
FOR YOU TO DECORATE.

41:08.867 --> 41:10.569
- DECORATE?

41:10.602 --> 41:12.838
- IT'S THE BEST INVESTMENT
ONE CAN MAKE.

41:12.871 --> 41:14.239
I MEAN, BESIDES BEING
A GREAT DEDUCTION,

41:14.272 --> 41:16.007
IT'S A PROVEN HEDGE
AGAINST INFLATION

41:16.041 --> 41:18.510
AND AN UNSTABLE ECONOMY.

41:20.278 --> 41:22.714
SO...

41:22.748 --> 41:24.650
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

41:24.683 --> 41:29.621
- I SAY THOSE ARE THE MOST
ROMANTIC WORDS I EVER HEARD.

41:29.655 --> 41:31.823
- YEAH?

41:42.100 --> 41:43.802
- ARE YOU COUNTING OFF
HOW MANY SHOPPING DAYS LEFT

41:43.835 --> 41:45.036
TILL CHRISTMAS?

41:45.070 --> 41:47.939
- IT'S MELANIE'S
OVULATION CYCLE.

41:47.973 --> 41:51.677
- AND WHAT A PERFECT SPOT
FOR IT, RIGHT BESIDE OUR BED.

41:51.710 --> 41:54.880
- WELL, IT'S TO REMIND ME
WHEN WE CAN DO IT

41:54.913 --> 41:56.648
AND WHEN WE CAN'T.

41:56.682 --> 41:58.016
- WHOEVER THOUGHT
OUR SEX LIFE

41:58.049 --> 42:00.619
WOULD BE RULED
BY A FERTILITY CHART?

42:00.652 --> 42:02.020
- WELL, NOW THAT I'M GOING
TO BE A FATHER,

42:02.053 --> 42:03.321
WITH FULL CREDIT
AND EVERYTHING,

42:03.354 --> 42:05.090
I GOTTA BE
EXTRA-SPECIAL RESPONSIBLE.

42:05.123 --> 42:08.159
TONIGHT LOOKS GOOD, THOUGH.
YOU UP FOR IT?

42:08.193 --> 42:09.928
- YEAH, SOON AS I GET BACK
FROM THE GYM.

42:09.961 --> 42:13.164
- WAIT, YOU'RE GOING
TO THE GYM AGAIN?

42:13.198 --> 42:15.166
WELL, DON'T BE LATE.

42:15.200 --> 42:17.636
- MISS MY WINDOW
OF OPPORTUNITY?

42:17.669 --> 42:19.605
- [hums]

42:22.874 --> 42:25.677
- HMM...BYE.

43:00.779 --> 43:05.583
- I BELIEVE
THIS BELONGS TO YOU.

43:08.787 --> 43:11.222
- THANKS.

43:11.256 --> 43:14.993
- ANY TIME.

43:16.327 --> 43:20.031
HERE.

43:22.033 --> 43:24.636
- [clears throat]

43:38.016 --> 43:41.787
SHOULDN'T YOU BE GETTING BACK
TO YOUR BOYFRIEND?

43:44.455 --> 43:48.126
- YEAH.

DON'T BE MISLED *

44:40.812 --> 44:42.914
* BY WHAT I SAID

44:42.948 --> 44:47.786
* YOU KNOW THE ONLY PLACE
I WANT TO BE IS HERE *

44:47.819 --> 44:52.390
* IF WE SHARED A BODY,
WE COULD BE ONE *

44:52.423 --> 44:56.061
* THE FIRST TIME AGAIN

44:56.094 --> 45:00.365
* IF WE SHARED A BODY,
WE COULD BE ONE *

45:00.398 --> 45:03.034
* THE FIRST TIME AGAIN

45:03.068 --> 45:10.976

45:12.911 --> 45:16.848
* CAN IT BE TRUE?
PASSING TIME *

45:16.882 --> 45:20.852
* OR IS IT
JUST INSIDE MY MIND? *

45:20.886 --> 45:22.888
* THE ONLY GOVERNMENT

45:22.921 --> 45:28.226
* I'D OVERTHROW

WE COULD BE ONE *

45:48.880 --> 45:51.850
* THE FIRST TIME AGAIN

45:51.883 --> 45:57.255
