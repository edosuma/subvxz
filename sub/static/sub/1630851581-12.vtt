This baby's the centrepiece

00:41.708 --> 00:43.001
of the exhibition!

00:44.670 --> 00:47.673
Hey, guys, let's take a break!

01:03.605 --> 01:04.564
Huh?

01:05.232 --> 01:07.651
Hey, Mike, you're here
for Techno Expo too?

01:07.734 --> 01:10.279
Yep. I've been planning
my tour all week.

01:10.279 --> 01:13.156
Whoa! You've planned
every minute of the day?

01:13.240 --> 01:14.992
I'm not wasting a second.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.869
I'm down for 39 minutes
at the circuit exhibit,

01:17.869 --> 01:20.706
then 31 checking out
"Computers from History".

01:20.706 --> 01:23.166
‐ 31 sounds about right.
‐ Mmm‐hmm.

01:23.250 --> 01:28.088
That leaves 52 whole minutes
with the RXXTBV‐3000.

01:28.088 --> 01:31.925
The OG of PCs!
I'm following your lead.

01:32.050 --> 01:34.595
Hey, let's wait at the doors
so we get in first.

01:34.595 --> 01:37.389
No can do. I gotta wait
for Andy and Liv.

01:37.389 --> 01:40.767
OK, I'll see you inside, I hope.
Knowing Andy's timing,

01:40.892 --> 01:43.937
‐ he might blow your schedule.
‐ Oh, I planned for that too.

01:43.937 --> 01:46.315
I told him to meet me
15 minutes early.

01:46.315 --> 01:48.900
Ha, ha! OK. See you later, then!

01:50.360 --> 01:53.322
Actually,
they should be here by now.

01:55.615 --> 01:57.492
‐ Phew!
‐ There!

01:57.617 --> 01:59.786
A few repairs
and it'll be as good as new.

01:59.786 --> 02:03.415
Great. We gotta bounce. We're
so late, Mike'll go ballistic!

02:03.498 --> 02:05.959
(Phone rings)

02:06.335 --> 02:10.172
‐ Hey! Hello, Mike! What's up?
‐ Where are you?

02:10.172 --> 02:13.175
The museum just opened and
we're already in a time crunch!

02:13.258 --> 02:16.470
Yeah, dude, we had
a mini‐catastrophe at home.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.680
I'll explain later.
We're on our way!

02:18.680 --> 02:21.391
What? Did another racoon
eat your homework?

02:21.475 --> 02:23.185
Hey! The racoon was real.

02:23.268 --> 02:25.312
Anyway,
I promise we're on our way!

02:26.396 --> 02:30.567
You were right. He is gonna
go ballistic. Let's boogie!

02:31.151 --> 02:34.196
‐ Bye, Dad!
‐ Thanks for your help, kids!

02:41.703 --> 02:43.997
Whoa!

02:45.374 --> 02:47.125
Amazing!

02:51.963 --> 02:53.548
Whoa!

02:58.845 --> 03:00.847
‐ Aaah!
‐ Boo!

03:02.516 --> 03:04.518
(Bubbling sounds)

03:09.773 --> 03:11.775
(Panting)

03:12.943 --> 03:15.612
‐ Mike, we're here!
‐ Finally!

03:15.612 --> 03:18.407
Next time, I'm telling you
to come two hours early.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.117
Yeah, super sorry, Mike,

03:20.200 --> 03:22.828
but our washing machine
had a malfunction.

03:22.828 --> 03:25.497
It ate all of Andy's underpants.
But we are here now!

03:26.081 --> 03:29.167
Don't bother, the schedule
is already all messed up.

03:30.585 --> 03:32.754
(Screaming)

03:32.754 --> 03:33.755
(Bubbling sounds)

03:35.465 --> 03:38.969
‐ Nothing's going as planned!
‐ (Bubbling sounds)

03:40.637 --> 03:43.682
Uh... Anybody catch
what he just burbled?

03:44.891 --> 03:46.393
Huddle up, guys!

03:49.062 --> 03:52.566
MS JONES: I'm detecting a Boo
signature at the museum, kids!

03:52.691 --> 03:54.443
We can barely hear you,
Ms Jones.

03:54.443 --> 03:58.238
Oh! Hey, Glowboo,
a little quiet please?

04:00.490 --> 04:03.743
I'm afraid I'm quite unfamiliar
with this fella.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.954
Glowboo will be on his way...
uh...

04:08.373 --> 04:10.667
after a recharge.
(Embarrassed laugh)

04:12.377 --> 04:14.588
Let's go, Ghost Force!

04:14.588 --> 04:17.048
Ghost Force!
Don't fear the glow!

04:23.221 --> 04:24.431
Fury!

04:25.682 --> 04:27.225
Krush!

04:28.185 --> 04:29.561
Myst!

04:32.981 --> 04:34.441
Ghost Force!

04:39.988 --> 04:44.159
No, no, no! Not the RXXTVB‐3000!

04:44.785 --> 04:47.454
The what now?
Oh, you mean that thing.

04:47.579 --> 04:50.832
It's cool. Everything
will be back to normal,

04:50.957 --> 04:53.293
and that jumbo calculator
will be OK too.

04:53.418 --> 04:56.338
‐ It's a supercomputer!
‐ Yeah, super.

04:56.421 --> 04:59.466
My point is it'll be
good as new, or... old.

04:59.591 --> 05:02.010
(Curator screaming)

05:05.972 --> 05:07.849
And how're we gonna fix that?

05:08.475 --> 05:10.185
Save it
for after we get our ghost!

05:14.231 --> 05:15.440
(Bubbling sounds)

05:20.487 --> 05:21.822
Let's go!

05:26.576 --> 05:28.912
(Screaming)

05:30.872 --> 05:32.374
Boo!

05:45.178 --> 05:47.389
It's going after
our washing machine!

05:47.389 --> 05:50.642
Your washing machine?
So, you weren't making that up?

05:50.642 --> 05:52.686
It's gonna merge!

05:54.354 --> 05:56.314
(Listening to music)

06:02.404 --> 06:03.738
Huh?

06:06.908 --> 06:09.035
(Evil laugh)

06:09.035 --> 06:09.911
Aaah!

06:12.372 --> 06:13.498
Spectral gate!

06:15.250 --> 06:16.626
Aaah!

06:18.461 --> 06:20.255
Aaah!

06:21.715 --> 06:24.050
Aaah!

06:24.050 --> 06:25.719
Run!

06:25.719 --> 06:28.096
Are you all right, Da...
uh... sir?

06:28.179 --> 06:30.473
(Bubbling sound)

06:31.224 --> 06:33.101
Get to safety, sir.

06:33.184 --> 06:34.144
Aaah!

06:45.989 --> 06:49.910
‐ ALL: Gah!
‐ (Laughter)

06:50.577 --> 06:53.163
We need a plan to stop
ol' Bubbly there. Krush?

06:53.246 --> 06:56.791
Let's neutralise its scrubbers.
Fury, you take the left,

06:56.916 --> 06:59.753
Myst, you take the right.
I'll hang back to finish up.

06:59.753 --> 07:03.340
By scrubbers do you mean
those firehoses of fury?

07:03.423 --> 07:05.342
Get up real close
so you don't miss!

07:05.342 --> 07:07.844
Um, don't you think
I can use my spectral gates?

07:07.844 --> 07:11.014
It'd take too long. Trust me,
we gotta follow the plan.

07:11.097 --> 07:12.265
BOTH: Um...

07:16.645 --> 07:18.730
Flexy blast!

07:22.108 --> 07:24.277
Not cool!

07:25.320 --> 07:27.072
Spectral arrow!

07:30.450 --> 07:33.328
That ghost
is cleaning up big time!

07:43.630 --> 07:45.674
Watch out!

07:46.383 --> 07:47.676
We need to get outta here!

07:56.142 --> 07:57.185
No!

08:06.569 --> 08:08.613
What just happened?
Where are they?

08:08.697 --> 08:10.782
They seam to be trapped
under the foam.

08:10.782 --> 08:13.493
What's the deal?
We've gotta help Myst and Fury!

08:13.576 --> 08:15.954
Impossible.
You may get swept away.

08:16.037 --> 08:18.832
A strategic retreat
is the best solution.

08:23.670 --> 08:26.589
‐ (Laughter)
‐ It is out of soap, for now.

08:26.589 --> 08:27.424
Let us go.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.730
Myst, Fury, do you copy?

08:41.813 --> 08:44.274
I said, do you copy?

08:44.274 --> 08:46.943
I am unable
to pinpoint their location.

08:47.027 --> 08:50.113
'cause of my failed strategy,
Myst and Fury have been hit.

08:50.113 --> 08:52.157
How come
nothing's going as planned?

08:52.157 --> 08:54.826
Even the simplest plans
are affected by

08:54.826 --> 08:59.039
over 1.2 billion variables.
Conclusion. Deal with it.

08:59.831 --> 09:01.541
I should've seen this coming!

09:02.000 --> 09:05.462
It is logically impossible to
foresee an unforeseen event.

09:07.130 --> 09:09.049
(Bubbling sound)

09:10.800 --> 09:12.385
Scrub‐a‐dub‐dub!

09:14.679 --> 09:15.889
You're up, Glowboo!

09:30.278 --> 09:32.781
You could do
with another spin cycle.

09:38.953 --> 09:39.829
Aaah!

09:44.542 --> 09:46.795
(Bubbling) Foam party's over,
Bubble Brush!

09:50.799 --> 09:51.674
Gah!

09:57.347 --> 09:59.766
Stabilisation completed.
Back to fight.

10:01.768 --> 10:02.602
Huh?

10:03.394 --> 10:05.855
It's the charge.
Don't let him open its gates.

10:20.411 --> 10:21.287
Checkmate!

10:27.794 --> 10:30.296
Try to wash this, Bubble Brush!

10:35.593 --> 10:37.095
Gromax!

11:05.748 --> 11:07.750
(Cheering)

11:07.834 --> 11:08.793
Thanks, Ghost Force!

11:11.629 --> 11:13.464
(Bubbling sound)

11:15.800 --> 11:18.845
‐ Phew! No more bubble talk!
‐ (Chuckles)

11:18.970 --> 11:21.222
Are you guys OK?
I was so worried!

11:21.306 --> 11:23.892
We're fine, and sparkling clean.

11:23.975 --> 11:27.353
Gotta say, blocking the door
was a brilliant plan, Krush!

11:27.478 --> 11:29.522
Actually,
I didn't plan anything.

11:29.647 --> 11:32.734
Sometimes you gotta fly
by the seat of your pants.

11:32.734 --> 11:35.361
That is what I call teamwork!

11:35.486 --> 11:38.198
Or clean work! Ha, ha, ha!

11:38.323 --> 11:39.365
Well done, kids!

11:40.033 --> 11:42.785
Let's check out the Techno Expo
before it closes!

11:42.869 --> 11:44.370
Boo‐yah!

11:50.168 --> 11:55.924
Wow, I guess they built that old
LMNOP‐8000 to survive anything.

11:55.924 --> 11:59.719
It's called the RXXTBV‐3000,
Andy.

11:59.719 --> 12:02.263
Amazing, huh?
You know, they used to call it

12:02.263 --> 12:05.099
the washing machine 'cause
it was so noisy.

12:05.099 --> 12:07.977
Can we stop talking about
washing machines?

12:07.977 --> 12:10.271
I'm traumatised enough!

12:23.243 --> 12:25.328
No teasing the ghost, Glups.

12:25.328 --> 12:27.497
That little spook
is a level eight.

12:27.747 --> 12:28.957
Let's get to work!

12:29.082 --> 12:30.291
We might even tame it

12:30.291 --> 12:32.210
if I can decipher
it's Boo energy.

12:32.335 --> 12:34.003
(Yawning)

12:34.420 --> 12:37.257
Right after I take
a quick snooze.

12:37.257 --> 12:40.885
(Snoring)

12:40.885 --> 12:42.595
Cake...

12:42.720 --> 12:45.306
Oh, gotta eat that cake...

12:45.306 --> 12:47.058
(Snoring)

12:57.944 --> 12:59.445
The coast is clear!

13:01.281 --> 13:04.575
Hey, Andy's pretty hyped about
our Friday study session, huh?

13:04.659 --> 13:07.036
Pretty sure that's not
what he's hyped about.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.539
Ready for another
training sesh, sis?

13:09.622 --> 13:12.750
'Cause today
I'm boo‐capping a ghost!

13:12.750 --> 13:15.086
Oh, yeah? Challenge accepted.

13:32.770 --> 13:34.897
Watcha got for us this week,
Ms Jones?

13:34.897 --> 13:36.733
‐ Huh?
‐ Shh!

13:36.816 --> 13:38.860
(Snoring)

13:38.860 --> 13:41.696
Not now. Ms Jones' neurons
need to recharge.

13:41.821 --> 13:45.324
Aw, she's so cute
when she's sleeping!

13:45.450 --> 13:48.870
Uh, not sure that cute's
the right word, Liv.

13:48.870 --> 13:51.581
Yo, check out
our training ghost of the day!

13:51.664 --> 13:55.376
Cool, she can snooze away while
we train on our own this time.

13:55.376 --> 13:56.711
You know the rules.

13:57.295 --> 13:59.714
Nobody except Ms Jones
starts a training session.

13:59.797 --> 14:02.633
Aw, come on, Mike,
it's just an egg.

14:02.717 --> 14:05.553
The Ghost Force
can handle an egg.

14:07.055 --> 14:08.765
I don't like
where this is going.

14:14.604 --> 14:17.440
Hold up! We've got no idea
what this ghost can do!

14:17.523 --> 14:20.068
So what? I know what we can do.

14:22.028 --> 14:24.280
Crush ghosts for a living.

14:33.414 --> 14:34.582
Huh? What's up?

14:34.582 --> 14:35.958
Are your superhero costumes

14:36.000 --> 14:37.168
at the dry cleaners?

14:41.047 --> 14:42.423
Heh, heh!

14:44.842 --> 14:45.802
Come on!

14:50.389 --> 14:51.933
Gah!

14:52.016 --> 14:54.769
(Laughter) A ghost‐chicken?

14:54.769 --> 14:58.147
See what you guys were so,
er, chickened about?

14:58.231 --> 14:59.065
(Groan)

15:01.943 --> 15:02.985
Huh?

15:07.615 --> 15:09.575
You have no idea
how to capture this ghost!

15:12.537 --> 15:13.579
End training session!

15:15.957 --> 15:16.833
Aaah!

15:20.294 --> 15:22.463
Er, who ordered
that chicken to go?

15:24.423 --> 15:28.136
Oh, no! Congrats, Andy.
That thing's called Glougloux,

15:28.219 --> 15:31.639
and it's a level‐eight
loose in Central Park!

15:31.639 --> 15:34.725
Uh... I'm sorry, guys.
I didn't think it would get out.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.145
We've gotta wake Ms Jones up.

15:37.145 --> 15:39.147
Wait, wait.
If she finds out what I did

15:39.272 --> 15:40.982
she'll kick me off
the Ghost Force!

15:41.107 --> 15:43.818
Or, worse,
make me compost her Boo bin!

15:43.943 --> 15:47.155
Well, you did unleash
a level‐eight ghost.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.949
My bad!
So let me fix this. Please?

15:50.533 --> 15:52.493
Fine.
But if this sitch escalates,

15:52.493 --> 15:54.203
we're telling Ms Jones, OK?

15:54.203 --> 15:55.830
‐ Yes.
‐ And...

15:55.830 --> 15:58.207
no more bailing
on our study group.

15:58.291 --> 16:01.544
‐ Sounds pretty fair to me!
‐ Argh!

16:01.544 --> 16:03.212
OK, deal.

16:03.212 --> 16:05.256
Let's go, Ghost Force!

16:06.007 --> 16:08.384
Ghost Force!
Don't fear the glow!

16:13.472 --> 16:14.765
Krush!

16:16.267 --> 16:17.560
Myst!

16:19.937 --> 16:21.522
Ghost Force!

16:24.901 --> 16:28.738
Lemme see what I can cook up,
Lieutenant Calaghan.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.865
One spicy pickle for the kick,

16:30.865 --> 16:35.578
and a strawberry for a burst
of freshness. Voilà!

16:35.578 --> 16:38.206
‐ Whoa!
‐ Oh, and a selection of ‐‐

16:38.206 --> 16:39.749
Aaah!

16:39.749 --> 16:41.334
And... Action!

16:42.043 --> 16:46.672
I, Solarman,
the man that has no fear...

16:46.672 --> 16:48.633
(Squeals)

16:49.550 --> 16:50.384
Aaah!

17:01.437 --> 17:04.941
‐ Ready to capture it, Fury?
‐ Bring on the Boo‐cap!

17:09.695 --> 17:11.781
Huh?

17:12.740 --> 17:14.158
It's boosting!

17:21.666 --> 17:23.501
What? He looks exactly the same!

17:23.584 --> 17:25.461
That boost was kinda a let‐down,
huh?

17:25.544 --> 17:27.171
Maybe it's just a lame duck!

17:31.008 --> 17:34.720
I wouldn't count your chickens
before they're hatched, Fury.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.433
Um, guys?
I'm starting to lose count!

17:40.017 --> 17:42.436
‐ We have to call Ms Jones!
‐ Hold up, please!

17:42.520 --> 17:44.981
Come on, we got this.
Right, Myst?

17:44.981 --> 17:49.110
‐ We need a plan. Krush?
‐ If the ghost is the same size,

17:49.110 --> 17:51.320
maybe his Boo energy
stayed the same too?

17:51.404 --> 17:54.073
A Boo‐cap oughta be enough
to capture it!

17:56.075 --> 17:58.619
It's heading to the city centre!
Let's do it!

18:05.001 --> 18:08.879
It's gotta be around here.
Over there! It's on 5th Avenue!

18:08.963 --> 18:10.339
I see it!

18:12.049 --> 18:13.426
ALL: What?

18:18.055 --> 18:19.265
Huh?

18:22.059 --> 18:23.311
(Screaming)

18:28.608 --> 18:30.943
‐ Oh, no!
‐ Aaah!

18:33.112 --> 18:34.614
(Clucking)

18:38.951 --> 18:40.620
Oh! Missed it!

18:42.455 --> 18:44.498
We'll never catch it like this.

18:44.498 --> 18:47.460
Agreed. We need to immobilise
its spectral membrane

18:47.585 --> 18:50.838
to prevent its Boo molecules
from transmogrifying.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.509
‐ Basically, I gotta freeze it.
‐ Oh!

18:55.593 --> 18:57.970
Let's go pluck that chicken!

19:05.561 --> 19:07.313
‐ There it is!
‐ Fractal power!

19:10.816 --> 19:12.109
You're up, bro.

19:12.902 --> 19:14.654
Boo‐cap take‐down, take two!

19:16.113 --> 19:18.783
Don't even think about
teleporting, Egghead.

19:18.866 --> 19:21.786
The Ghost Force
has got you on blast.

19:21.786 --> 19:23.954
‐ Get on with it, Fury!
‐ Oh, yeah, right!

19:41.597 --> 19:44.725
Whoa! That's even harsher
than my alarm clock!

19:45.976 --> 19:48.229
(Nervous laugh)

19:48.813 --> 19:50.731
What?

19:50.731 --> 19:53.067
Oh, no!

19:53.067 --> 19:54.610
The eggs! They've hatched!

19:54.694 --> 19:56.779
This is bad.
We should've told Ms Jones.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.948
‐ You're right, but...
‐ So,

19:59.031 --> 20:02.159
I was having a lovely dream
about chicken and waffles,

20:02.243 --> 20:05.621
yum, when I was woken up by
a thundering cocka‐doodle‐doo,

20:05.705 --> 20:09.166
which made me wonder... do you
have something to tell me?

20:10.000 --> 20:11.627
It's my fault, Ms Jones.

20:11.711 --> 20:14.088
I released Glougloux
into the training room.

20:14.171 --> 20:17.299
I never thought poultry
could be so fierce.

20:17.383 --> 20:21.053
Save it for later, Fury.
We have more urgent business!

20:21.178 --> 20:24.098
‐ How do we fix this?
‐ Find the original Glougloux,

20:24.181 --> 20:27.727
which won't be easy now that
it's hatched hundreds of chicks!

20:27.727 --> 20:30.938
KRUSH: There's gotta be
some way to tell them apart.

20:34.191 --> 20:35.568
They're all identical.

20:35.568 --> 20:38.446
Unless... the original Glougloux

20:38.446 --> 20:41.741
doesn't follow the same pattern
of movement as the others!

20:41.866 --> 20:44.076
You're saying
the original Glougloux

20:44.076 --> 20:46.746
‐ doesn't move the same way?
‐ Yes, it teleports

20:46.871 --> 20:50.082
in a spiral pattern,
like the patterns on its shell.

20:50.207 --> 20:52.710
Wait. If we trace
the spiral of its movements...

20:52.710 --> 20:55.045
We can predict
where it's gonna pop up next!

20:55.045 --> 20:57.882
Never thought I'd say this,
but you're a genius, Fury!

20:57.965 --> 21:00.092
I know, right?
But let's backtrack.

21:00.217 --> 21:03.304
After Glougloux escaped the lab
it teleported

21:03.304 --> 21:05.514
‐ to Central Park.
‐ Then to the subway.

21:05.598 --> 21:08.309
And then to the bank.
You tracking this, Ms Jones?

21:08.309 --> 21:10.978
Like a hawk.
If my calculations are correct,

21:11.061 --> 21:13.814
it should appear above
the Empire State Building...

21:14.440 --> 21:17.359
‐ any second now!
‐ Copy that, Ms Jones.

21:20.029 --> 21:22.114
I hope we're
ahead of the game this time.

21:23.073 --> 21:24.116
There!

21:24.492 --> 21:26.535
I won't go easy on you
this time!

21:26.619 --> 21:27.828
Fractal power!

21:41.467 --> 21:44.303
Fury!
You'll have to get to Glougloux!

21:44.303 --> 21:46.305
Krush, hold on!
I got your backs!

21:55.648 --> 21:56.774
Myst!

21:57.983 --> 21:59.819
‐ Myst!
‐ Let me go!

21:59.819 --> 22:01.570
Oh, no! I need to hurry!

22:06.951 --> 22:07.910
Flexy shield!

22:13.123 --> 22:14.124
Fury! Catch him!

22:20.297 --> 22:21.423
Yah!

22:24.134 --> 22:25.344
Too... heavy!

22:28.389 --> 22:29.181
Got ya!

22:43.529 --> 22:46.866
(Cheering)

22:49.159 --> 22:53.247
Gotta admit,
you were one hard‐boiled ghost!

22:53.247 --> 22:54.373
Boo‐yah!

23:16.270 --> 23:20.524
Ah! We were this close to a
world ruled by phantom poultry.

23:20.524 --> 23:24.194
‐ Isn't that right, Andy?
‐ Yeah, sorry, Ms Jones.

23:24.194 --> 23:26.530
Promise
to never let it happen again.

23:26.530 --> 23:29.491
At least our near‐catastrophe
has taught you

23:29.491 --> 23:34.204
that even the smallest ghost
can cause a world of trouble.

23:34.204 --> 23:38.584
So... You're not gonna punish me
with Boo‐compost cleaning duty?

23:38.709 --> 23:41.921
‐ I'm not that cruel.
‐ You're the best, Ms Jones.

23:42.046 --> 23:43.714
Now we can start training!

23:43.923 --> 23:48.385
Ahem! At our Friday‐night
study group. Remember our deal?

23:48.510 --> 23:50.554
I reserved a table
at the library!

23:50.679 --> 23:52.222
Oh!
