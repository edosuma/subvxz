WEBVTT

00:03.899 --> 00:07.086
It is time
for us to retire.

00:07.144 --> 00:09.501
And you want me
to take your place?

00:09.589 --> 00:12.027
With the help of
your friends, of course.

00:12.121 --> 00:15.805
You may call
me Grogar.

00:15.892 --> 00:19.034
Together, Equestria
will be ours.

00:19.122 --> 00:22.678
I will take back the
Crystal Empire on my own!

00:22.765 --> 00:24.113
How are we
going to stop them?

00:24.200 --> 00:25.700
With the
Elements of Harmony!

00:25.787 --> 00:28.117
With those, we can
defeat anypony.

01:20.523 --> 01:22.824
What just happened!

01:22.912 --> 01:26.729
The Tree of Harmony can't
really be gone, can it?

01:26.875 --> 01:28.144
It can't be.

01:28.232 --> 01:31.730
But it is! You thought
you'd defeated me,

01:31.968 --> 01:33.416
but you led
me right to

01:33.503 --> 01:35.451
the source of
your power!

01:35.538 --> 01:37.683
Now that it's
destroyed,

01:37.878 --> 01:39.870
nothing can stop me!

01:42.606 --> 01:44.659
He's right. With
the Elements gone,

01:44.747 --> 01:46.324
I don't know how
we can defeat him.

01:46.412 --> 01:49.917
Then we'll just have to beat
him the old-fashioned way!

02:10.740 --> 02:12.003
Hey!

02:12.174 --> 02:14.511
Ha! You're no match for me!

02:14.599 --> 02:17.605
I will finally rule
the Crystal Empire.

02:17.966 --> 02:24.230
Wait. With you out of the way,
I will rule all of Equestria!

02:24.318 --> 02:25.441
NO!

02:25.529 --> 02:30.316
Oh, yes. And I think I know
exactly where I'll start!

02:30.468 --> 02:32.217
Don't you dare say it.

02:32.304 --> 02:35.520
Your sweet little home town.

02:35.779 --> 02:37.894
You leave Ponyville alone!

02:37.982 --> 02:39.168
Or what?

02:39.256 --> 02:43.417
Without your Elements, it would
be so easy to control you.

02:48.598 --> 02:50.018
But there's no point,

02:50.362 --> 02:54.347
my conquering Ponyville is
already your greatest fear!

02:54.617 --> 02:55.863
Ha ha ha ha!

02:57.653 --> 02:58.767
NO!

03:00.872 --> 03:02.229
What do we do?

03:02.317 --> 03:05.173
I don't know. The Tree of
Harmony grew the Elements;

03:05.261 --> 03:07.534
it kept the Everfree
Forest under control.

03:07.684 --> 03:08.932
And now it's gone.

03:09.098 --> 03:10.779
Sombra will take
over Equestria,

03:10.866 --> 03:12.545
and it's all my fault.

03:12.711 --> 03:15.117
I knew I wasn't ready to
take the Princesses' place,

03:15.204 --> 03:17.959
but I never thought
I'd mess up this badly.

03:20.711 --> 03:22.558
What are you
looking at me for?

03:22.646 --> 03:24.753
This is usually when
you say something funny

03:24.841 --> 03:26.465
to lift our spirits.

03:26.661 --> 03:29.248
Sorry, nothing about
this is funny to me.

03:31.326 --> 03:33.724
I'm sorry, I'm
trying to be strong,

03:33.817 --> 03:36.191
but I just can't bear to think
about poor Sweetie Belle

03:36.279 --> 03:38.521
under the spell
of that monster.

03:38.609 --> 03:40.691
Or those sweet
little Cake twins.

03:40.877 --> 03:42.943
Or Spike or Starlight.

03:43.031 --> 03:46.941
Or Angel or anypony forced
to do that monster's bidding!

03:48.575 --> 03:49.764
What the...

03:49.852 --> 03:52.349
Twilight, what are you doing?

03:52.516 --> 03:54.498
We can't just stay here.

03:54.659 --> 03:57.041
I don't have a plan and I don't
know what I'm going to do

03:57.129 --> 03:59.394
once we get out,
but we can't just sit here

03:59.482 --> 04:02.341
and let Sombra make slaves
of every pony we love.

04:02.606 --> 04:04.498
Let me help. I'm faster.

04:06.711 --> 04:08.066
I like digging.

04:10.878 --> 04:12.896
I've been known to
get my hooves dirty.

04:12.984 --> 04:14.162
Move over, y'all!

04:14.250 --> 04:17.201
Normally I wouldn't dream
of digging, but right now...

04:17.289 --> 04:19.482
Show me the muddy!

04:37.353 --> 04:38.746
Apple Bloom!

04:39.327 --> 04:41.941
It's me. Look at
me, sugarcube!

04:43.459 --> 04:46.472
Twilight, you gotta
free her, please.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.184
I-I-can't. Without
the Elements,

04:56.272 --> 04:59.321
my magic isn't strong
enough to stop Sombra's!

04:59.408 --> 05:00.714
Spike!

05:03.813 --> 05:06.195
Spike, where are you
going? Starlight?

05:06.282 --> 05:09.064
We must lay siege to Canterlot.

05:09.151 --> 05:11.133
No! Snap out of it, you two!

05:11.220 --> 05:13.168
You're stronger than his magic.

05:13.255 --> 05:15.237
Sweetie
Belle, please stop!

05:15.324 --> 05:17.239
I can't get her to stop.
I can't get her to...

05:17.326 --> 05:19.975
None of us can. We
can't reach them.

05:29.292 --> 05:32.054
He made them bake a black
licorice fruitcake that says.

05:32.141 --> 05:34.089
"Congratulations to our
favorite Supreme Emperor,

05:34.176 --> 05:36.825
King Sombra!" in
green frosting.

05:36.912 --> 05:39.695
It's the ugliest
cake I've ever seen!

05:42.084 --> 05:45.558
Twilight, this is
bad. Like really bad.

05:45.646 --> 05:49.290
I've never been so
sad in my whole life.

05:49.477 --> 05:51.683
I don't know what to do.
I don't know how to free them

05:51.771 --> 05:53.486
and I don't know
how to stop Sombra!

05:53.589 --> 05:56.410
Everypony was so sure
I'd do such a great job.

05:56.499 --> 05:58.447
Well, this is exactly
what I was afraid of.

05:58.534 --> 06:00.983
Could anything else
possibly go wrong?

06:01.070 --> 06:04.119
Well, with the Tree
of Harmony gone,

06:04.206 --> 06:06.158
the Everfree Forest
could grow out of control

06:06.246 --> 06:07.636
and threaten the town.

06:07.724 --> 06:09.878
Darling, that's
oddly specific.

06:22.256 --> 06:24.338
Even if we figure out
how to defeat Sombra

06:24.426 --> 06:26.175
and bring everypony
back to Ponyville,

06:26.263 --> 06:27.842
if we don't stop the forest,

06:27.930 --> 06:29.812
there won't be a
Ponyville to come back to.

06:36.472 --> 06:37.730
Ahem.

06:42.791 --> 06:44.075
For our friends.

06:44.226 --> 06:45.807
For our families.

06:45.995 --> 06:47.676
For our home.

06:47.764 --> 06:49.246
For Equestria.

06:50.881 --> 06:53.434
Equestria!

07:08.003 --> 07:10.223
You! Break it down.

07:25.835 --> 07:29.981
They've fled.
Celestia and Luna are too cowardly

07:30.069 --> 07:33.629
to even stand against me.

07:33.864 --> 07:36.643
Equestria is mine!

07:55.778 --> 07:57.168
Come on, everypony!

08:07.398 --> 08:08.934
We've been at this for hours,

08:09.022 --> 08:11.004
but it's just growin'
back too fast!

08:11.248 --> 08:13.332
We have to keep trying!

08:24.183 --> 08:26.665
I know we're supposed to
be able to handle things

08:26.766 --> 08:28.135
on our own, but I've
never been happier

08:28.222 --> 08:30.016
to see two ponies
in my whole life!

08:30.552 --> 08:33.360
Nopony is meant to
handle this on their own.

08:33.448 --> 08:35.395
Starswirl! The Tree
of Harmony, it's...

08:35.491 --> 08:39.063
I know. I alerted the
princesses as soon as I could.

08:39.260 --> 08:41.015
I felt it, when it happened.

08:41.104 --> 08:44.654
Like part of my essence
just ceased to be.

08:44.805 --> 08:47.329
I know what you mean.
I'm sorry.

08:47.490 --> 08:50.251
Don't be. I've more
than enough magic in me

08:50.339 --> 08:52.587
to keep the Everfree
Forest under control.

08:52.675 --> 08:53.774
You can do that?

08:53.862 --> 08:56.244
The Pillars and I planted
the Tree of Harmony.

08:56.465 --> 08:59.038
Who do you think kept
the Forest under control

08:59.126 --> 09:00.915
before it did?

09:02.882 --> 09:04.165
It will take time,

09:04.253 --> 09:07.102
but with the Princesses'
help, I can keep it at bay.

09:12.524 --> 09:15.509
Aw, yeah! Go get 'em, Beardy!

09:22.661 --> 09:26.144
Sombra's back and he's taken
control of all of our friends.

09:26.302 --> 09:28.618
We've left Canterlot
defenseless!

09:28.765 --> 09:32.515
Twilight, you must
go! Defend Equestria

09:32.603 --> 09:34.952
and we shall
contain the forest.

09:35.040 --> 09:37.899
At least now we're back
to just one problem.

09:48.082 --> 09:51.063
Aw, everypony's all evil-y.

09:51.837 --> 09:53.452
Sombra's going
to force us

09:53.540 --> 09:55.584
to fight our way
through our friends?

09:55.671 --> 09:57.019
Not if I can help it!

10:11.651 --> 10:14.767
OK. Guess we need a
different plan. Twilight?

10:14.861 --> 10:17.371
I don't know! I'm not
prepared to fight against

10:17.459 --> 10:19.134
the citizens of Equestria.

10:19.222 --> 10:22.238
I guess that's one more
thing I'm not ready to do.

10:22.416 --> 10:24.197
Well, we'd better figure
out something quick

10:24.285 --> 10:26.532
because none of them seem
to have a problem with it.

10:37.501 --> 10:39.579
Sorry about this, Fancy Pants!

10:44.575 --> 10:47.188
We promise we'll let y'all
out as soon as we can!

10:51.291 --> 10:53.243
Will I go here?

10:53.496 --> 10:54.844
Or here?

10:54.932 --> 10:56.978
Or here or there!

10:59.009 --> 11:00.211
Huh?

11:12.206 --> 11:13.253
Gotcha!

11:16.361 --> 11:18.309
I don't know how long
we can hold them off.

11:18.513 --> 11:20.428
And holding them off
isn't what we need anyhow.

11:20.515 --> 11:22.230
We need to get inside.

11:22.411 --> 11:23.938
But we can't just
leave them here,

11:24.026 --> 11:25.941
all possessed and Sombrafied.

11:26.144 --> 11:27.992
What do we do, Twilight?

11:28.087 --> 11:30.369
I don't know, but
we can't stay here.

11:33.681 --> 11:35.540
I'm sorry we couldn't
help our friends,

11:35.681 --> 11:37.429
but I didn't know
what else to do.

11:37.517 --> 11:38.969
At least we're inside.

11:39.057 --> 11:43.477
Yeah. All we have to do
now is defeat King Sombra.

11:44.064 --> 11:45.899
I... we...

11:48.143 --> 11:51.532
Oh, my. No Elements?
No princesses?

11:51.620 --> 11:53.961
Seems like you're in
a bit of a pickle.

11:54.055 --> 11:57.407
Or are you in
more of a jam?

11:57.914 --> 11:59.516
Mmmmm.

11:59.604 --> 12:02.540
Discord! What are
you doing here?

12:02.631 --> 12:04.679
Well, I was going to hang
these up all over the castle

12:04.766 --> 12:06.782
to celebrate your coronation,

12:06.870 --> 12:09.977
but apparently, it's
a bit premature.

12:11.824 --> 12:13.305
I'm so glad to see you!

12:13.501 --> 12:15.165
We could really use
some all-powerful.

12:15.253 --> 12:17.383
Lord of Chaos' help right now.

12:17.471 --> 12:20.528
Moi? Oh, I couldn't possibly.

12:26.217 --> 12:27.465
Aw, poodles!

12:30.667 --> 12:32.532
Discord, please?

12:32.995 --> 12:35.368
Ugh. Fine.

12:35.456 --> 12:38.712
Just to be clear, I was really
rooting for you to do this

12:38.800 --> 12:41.618
on your own and parlay
that confidence boost

12:41.706 --> 12:45.594
into being the best Protectors
of Equestria you can be.

12:45.821 --> 12:48.938
A little less talking and
a little more helping!

12:56.503 --> 12:58.040
Thank you, Discord!

12:58.128 --> 13:00.157
I don't know what
we'd do without you.

13:08.905 --> 13:13.227
OK, "King" Sombra. Time
to give up the crown.

13:15.104 --> 13:17.820
Here to fight the good fight
with nothing but your wits?

13:17.982 --> 13:19.866
Admirable, but foolish.

13:19.954 --> 13:21.275
Ha!

13:24.854 --> 13:28.352
Well, I guess it's on
me to be the MVP today.

13:28.440 --> 13:32.857
I was betting on you, and
I do hate being wrong.

13:32.999 --> 13:34.258
Although if you think about it,

13:34.346 --> 13:39.571
I am your friend so maybe you
win because friendship wins?

13:39.659 --> 13:42.141
Although Fluttershy should
get most of the credit for that.

13:42.680 --> 13:44.547
She's my favorite.

13:52.341 --> 13:54.126
Discord!

14:01.339 --> 14:04.855
Not even the Lord of Chaos
can stand against me!

14:05.320 --> 14:08.856
I am truly the most powerful
creature in Equestria!

14:11.727 --> 14:13.175
Discord!

14:13.262 --> 14:14.543
We need you!

14:14.630 --> 14:16.446
Please wake up. Please wake up.

14:19.584 --> 14:20.931
Discord!

14:21.019 --> 14:24.636
I'm so glad you're OK. We
can't beat him without you.

14:24.724 --> 14:27.267
You couldn't beat
me with him either!

14:31.338 --> 14:33.759
It would appear that
you're on your own.

14:36.501 --> 14:39.321
I have nothing left to give.

14:39.572 --> 14:42.187
That's it then. We're doomed?

14:42.275 --> 14:43.602
Of course you are!

14:43.690 --> 14:46.720
I can't believe it's taken
you this long to realize it!

14:46.879 --> 14:50.863
Now, how shall I
eliminate all this clutter

14:50.950 --> 14:52.727
in my throne room?

14:54.768 --> 14:57.579
Listen to me.
You don't need me.

14:57.667 --> 14:59.858
You don't need the princesses

14:59.946 --> 15:02.540
and you certainly don't
need the Elements.

15:02.652 --> 15:05.915
Fluttershy, you will
always be kind.

15:06.098 --> 15:08.712
Applejack, you will
always be honest.

15:08.813 --> 15:13.009
Rarity, you'll
always be generous.

15:13.097 --> 15:17.118
And Rainbow Dash will
be loyal as can be.

15:17.343 --> 15:21.634
Pinkie will always bring
laughter wherever she goes

15:21.766 --> 15:27.251
and Twilight, you are
and always will be

15:27.391 --> 15:29.798
the embodiment of Magic.

15:30.459 --> 15:33.469
You lost sight of
what's in front of you.

15:33.610 --> 15:36.975
You're here, together,
willing to give

15:37.063 --> 15:39.587
everything you've
got for Equestria.

15:39.712 --> 15:44.634
Nothing and no pony can ever
take that away from you

15:44.847 --> 15:48.097
because that's who you are.

15:49.948 --> 15:52.991
It's going to take more
than a sentimental speech

15:53.079 --> 15:54.454
to save you.

15:54.612 --> 15:55.895
Discord's right.

15:55.983 --> 15:57.639
We've proven
time and time again

15:57.727 --> 16:00.784
that the real magic is the
six of us working together.

16:00.872 --> 16:04.021
With these girls by my
side, I'm not afraid of you.

16:04.216 --> 16:07.425
I'm not afraid of what you can
do or how much power you have.

16:07.527 --> 16:08.641
You should be.

16:11.474 --> 16:14.704
You may knock us down, but we're
going to get back up again.

16:17.269 --> 16:18.431
And again.

16:20.172 --> 16:22.421
And again. As long
as we're together,

16:22.508 --> 16:24.806
we will never stop
trying to defeat you.

16:30.683 --> 16:32.370
For our friends.

16:32.686 --> 16:34.667
For our families.

16:34.856 --> 16:36.304
For our Home.

16:36.555 --> 16:37.870
For Equestria.

16:41.694 --> 16:47.412
No! This can't be possible!
Your magic can't defeat mine!

16:47.499 --> 16:51.379
I destroyed the
source of your power.

16:51.485 --> 16:54.268
You can't destroy our
friendship, Sombra.

16:54.364 --> 16:57.480
And we keep telling bad guys.

16:57.568 --> 17:00.351
But y'all just don't
seem to remember.

17:00.562 --> 17:02.377
Friendship is magic.

17:09.315 --> 17:12.330
No!

17:31.232 --> 17:33.247
Do you want more juice?

17:33.380 --> 17:37.330
Only if it's not too much
trouble, and it's red,

17:37.449 --> 17:40.893
and it has one of those little
umbrellas, and two cherries.

17:40.981 --> 17:46.042
No no. Actually make it three.
And maybe some doughnuts?

17:46.197 --> 17:49.370
I see you've made
yourselves at home.

17:49.461 --> 17:52.611
Celestia! Luna! I know
what you're going to say.

17:52.776 --> 17:54.805
I should have called on
you as soon as I knew

17:54.893 --> 17:56.284
how dangerous it was.

17:56.425 --> 17:59.761
A good leader knows when to
ask for help and I didn't.

17:59.849 --> 18:03.237
And because of me, the Tree
of Harmony was destroyed.

18:03.342 --> 18:05.524
Equestria deserves somepony
much better than me

18:05.612 --> 18:06.839
as its leader.

18:07.006 --> 18:08.354
You're right.

18:08.839 --> 18:09.839
Oh!

18:09.931 --> 18:14.425
About one thing. A good leader
knows when to ask for help.

18:14.608 --> 18:17.335
But a great leader has
the courage to admit

18:17.423 --> 18:18.870
when they've
made a mistake

18:18.999 --> 18:21.401
and the strength
to make it right.

18:21.557 --> 18:24.308
Today, you've proven to
me beyond any doubt,

18:24.396 --> 18:26.611
that you will be a
great leader.

18:26.800 --> 18:27.886
Will be?

18:28.043 --> 18:30.617
Luna and I have decided
it may have been

18:30.705 --> 18:33.285
a bit unfair to thrust
this upon you

18:33.372 --> 18:35.893
without giving you the
time you need to prepare.

18:36.092 --> 18:39.580
Oh, thank goodness! I
really wasn't ready.

18:39.737 --> 18:43.440
Not ready? So Twilight's
not taking over?

18:43.649 --> 18:44.924
This was all for nothing?

18:45.096 --> 18:47.265
I pretended to be
very hurt and gave

18:47.352 --> 18:49.804
one of the most convincing
speeches of my life.

18:49.892 --> 18:51.330
PRETENDED?

18:51.481 --> 18:54.577
Of course. You don't
think some would-be-king

18:54.665 --> 18:57.096
could actually hurt the
Lord of Chaos, do you?

18:57.184 --> 19:00.437
Anyway, as I was saying,
I pretended to be very hurt

19:00.525 --> 19:02.804
to convince you that
you didn't need anything

19:02.892 --> 19:05.010
but yourself to be
the incredible leader

19:05.098 --> 19:08.615
I know you can be! And
now it's not happening?

19:08.841 --> 19:11.705
It will, but when she's ready.

19:12.211 --> 19:14.346
How can she not be ready?

19:14.434 --> 19:17.951
What a waste of a perfectly
wonderful speech!

19:18.141 --> 19:20.986
Honestly, I don't know
why I even bother!

19:21.838 --> 19:25.203
So he could have ended
the whole Sombra thing

19:25.369 --> 19:26.705
whenever he wanted.

19:26.792 --> 19:29.741
But he didn't because he cares.

19:29.877 --> 19:32.002
That's Discord for you.

19:32.242 --> 19:35.273
He sure has a weird way
of being supportive.

19:35.361 --> 19:37.385
Super odd dude.

19:38.588 --> 19:39.875
I heard that.

19:43.475 --> 19:46.844
Also, truth be told, Celestia
and I had fun today,

19:46.932 --> 19:49.828
fighting side-by-side with
Starswirl for our home!

19:49.915 --> 19:52.711
It's been years since we've
gotten to do what you girls do.

19:52.806 --> 19:55.259
You all make it look so easy.

19:55.431 --> 19:58.481
Well, we are kind of
an awesome team.

19:58.638 --> 20:00.836
Every adventure
is heart-pounding

20:00.924 --> 20:02.463
but so rewarding!

20:02.587 --> 20:06.477
I'm up for anything, as long
as it's with all of you!

20:06.565 --> 20:09.275
Life certainly hasn't
been dull since we met.

20:09.535 --> 20:11.307
Nowhere else I'd rather be.

20:11.419 --> 20:13.334
We are pretty
incredible together.

20:13.422 --> 20:15.603
And we would do
anything for Equestria.

20:15.736 --> 20:18.452
I guess I know,
when the time comes,

20:18.610 --> 20:21.156
as long as we're
together, we probably...

20:21.244 --> 20:22.694
Ahem!

20:22.877 --> 20:24.663
We definitely got this.

20:32.129 --> 20:34.478
Now, I'll say something
nice about centaurs.

20:34.593 --> 20:37.709
Tirek, you say something
nice about changelings.

20:37.796 --> 20:40.278
And Chrysalis, you say
something nice about ponies.

20:40.435 --> 20:41.744
NEVER!

20:43.867 --> 20:48.572
Let us hope the three of you
will be enough for my plans.

20:49.442 --> 20:51.455
And what of King Sombra?

20:51.543 --> 20:53.275
Did he succeed?

20:53.363 --> 20:54.492
HA!

21:01.753 --> 21:05.400
I'd say he gambled and lost.

21:05.546 --> 21:07.672
But at least he can
serve as a warning

21:07.760 --> 21:10.542
to those who doubt
continuing with my plans.

21:10.629 --> 21:14.213
Unless any of you have doubts.

21:14.433 --> 21:15.861
Not I.

21:16.041 --> 21:17.533
- No.
- I'm good.

21:17.621 --> 21:20.922
Then we shall join
forces and work together

21:21.010 --> 21:23.554
to bring Equestria
to its knees.
