WEBVTT

00:01.069 --> 00:02.736
HOPE (in distance):
Num-num!

00:02.770 --> 00:05.673
(Hope bawling in distance)

00:05.706 --> 00:08.109
We found some extra
Halloween boxes.

00:08.142 --> 00:11.812
And by the way, your kid is
still screaming for her num-num.

00:11.845 --> 00:12.880
HOPE:
Num-num!
Seriously, Jimmy,

00:12.913 --> 00:15.816
either she gets her pacifier
or I get a sedative.

00:15.849 --> 00:18.186
One of us is gonna be addicted
something-- you choose.

00:18.219 --> 00:20.221
The book said to try
and go cold-turkey

00:20.254 --> 00:22.556
if nothing else works,
and nothing else has worked.

00:24.758 --> 00:27.428
See? Doesn't Daddy look silly

00:27.461 --> 00:28.429
with...

00:28.462 --> 00:31.232
(quiet squeaky
groaning)

00:31.265 --> 00:34.268
(quiet, squeaky
groaning continues)

00:34.302 --> 00:35.603
I think we should look
at the pros and cons

00:35.636 --> 00:37.205
of not giving Hope
her num-num.

00:37.238 --> 00:39.240
Pro: she's learning
to take care of herself.

00:39.273 --> 00:41.509
Con: She'll start sucking
her thumb, mess up her teeth,

00:41.542 --> 00:43.744
end up going to Winter Formal
with her gay best friend

00:43.777 --> 00:45.346
because nobody asked the girl

00:45.379 --> 00:46.447
with massive braces
and headgear.

00:47.448 --> 00:48.416
I'll get her the pacifier.

00:48.449 --> 00:50.251
HOPE (in distance):
Num-num!

00:50.284 --> 00:53.254
Speaking of pros and cons,

00:53.287 --> 00:55.756
what if I dress as a pro

00:55.789 --> 00:59.393
and you can go... as a con.

00:59.427 --> 01:03.431
Yeah, and you could hit me
with this old rubber nightstick.

01:03.464 --> 01:04.598
Wait a minute.

01:04.632 --> 01:06.234
These aren't
costumes.

01:06.267 --> 01:09.470
(gasps) This is Maw Maw
and Paw Paw's old sex box!

01:09.503 --> 01:10.871
(grunts)

01:10.904 --> 01:11.572
Ugh!

01:11.605 --> 01:12.540
(grunts)

01:12.573 --> 01:14.475
(Burt continues grunting)

01:14.508 --> 01:16.177
(shudders)
(yelps)

01:16.210 --> 01:17.311
*

01:17.345 --> 01:19.247
* Whoo!

01:19.280 --> 01:20.248
* Here we go

01:20.281 --> 01:23.651
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

01:26.187 --> 01:29.323
Hey, I found a couple "C"
batteries in Maw Maw's sex box.

01:29.357 --> 01:31.392
We can finally play
electronic Battleship.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.427
And you made
mice-mallows?

01:33.461 --> 01:36.464
Mm-hmm.
I don't care what those guys
running for president say,

01:36.497 --> 01:38.332
this is the best country
in the world.

01:38.366 --> 01:40.601
Sorry, Burt, I can't play
Battleship with you.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.136
It's Bunko night.

01:42.170 --> 01:44.138
But last Thursday
was Bunko night.

01:44.172 --> 01:45.339
Every Thursday's Bunko night.

01:45.373 --> 01:47.508
Every Thursday?
Forever?

01:47.541 --> 01:49.143
You'll be okay.

01:49.177 --> 01:51.512
Here. Have a mice-mallow.

02:02.490 --> 02:04.325
Feel better?
(muffled):
A little bit.

02:05.793 --> 02:07.228
(sighs)

02:07.261 --> 02:09.129
E-5.

02:11.399 --> 02:12.433
(beep)

02:12.466 --> 02:13.467
COMPUTER VOICE:
Miss.

02:13.501 --> 02:15.203
Oh.

02:22.310 --> 02:23.677
(exhales)

02:23.711 --> 02:25.879
(crashing)

02:25.913 --> 02:27.515
(groans softly)

02:29.517 --> 02:30.684
Geez.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.323
B-4.

02:35.356 --> 02:38.359
Do you know anything
about gay people?

02:38.392 --> 02:41.362
I think sometimes
they like to wear handkerchiefs.

02:41.395 --> 02:43.464
Okay. I can work with that.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.566
Do you need to...

02:45.599 --> 02:47.368
buy a handkerchief?

02:47.401 --> 02:49.403
What? No.
'Cause it'd be cool if you did.

02:49.437 --> 02:51.572
No, Sabrina has
this gay friend, Jordan,

02:51.605 --> 02:53.341
and every time he and his
boyfriend come to town,

02:53.374 --> 02:55.243
I end up looking like an idiot.

02:55.276 --> 02:58.246
(laughter)

02:58.279 --> 03:01.382
It's like our drama teacher
from eighth grade, remember?

03:01.415 --> 03:03.517
Mr. K-- he was always
talking about his mystery wife.

03:03.551 --> 03:04.718
JORDAN:
We called her
Mrs. Beard.

03:04.752 --> 03:06.887
Well, guess
where I ran into him.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.390
It starts with "Fire"
and it ends with "Island."

03:09.423 --> 03:11.392
Oh, you're so bad!

03:11.425 --> 03:13.361
Oh, James looks lost.

03:13.394 --> 03:15.329
(voice squeaks):
No. I...

03:15.363 --> 03:17.365
Your teacher's wife had some
unfortunate facial hair,

03:17.398 --> 03:19.733
and then he ended up
on a burning island.

03:19.767 --> 03:20.801
(smacks lips)

03:21.535 --> 03:23.271
Uh, no, we just had a...

03:23.304 --> 03:26.006
teacher who's obviously gay
who refused to come out.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.107
Oh, I get it.
Yeah, it's stupid

03:27.140 --> 03:29.610
when a gay guy tries to act
like a normal person.

03:31.479 --> 03:32.580
(whispers):
Jimmy.

03:32.613 --> 03:35.416
I did it again?

03:35.449 --> 03:37.385
That's offensive?
You didn't know that, either?

03:37.418 --> 03:39.587
How am I supposed to know that?
I don't know any gay people.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.689
When I'd watch Will & Grace,
I'd fall asleep.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.525
Till that lady with
the squeaky voice came on.

03:44.558 --> 03:47.695
Is it weird that we don't
really know any gay people?

03:47.728 --> 03:49.363
We clean pools
and cut lawns.

03:49.397 --> 03:51.399
There's not a lot of gay guys
in that profession.

03:51.432 --> 03:53.434
It's not like
we've been avoiding them.

03:53.467 --> 03:54.435
I guess that's true.

03:54.468 --> 03:56.937
But it doesn't help me
not look like an idiot.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.939
And they're staying with her
again this week.

03:58.972 --> 04:01.409
You know what you should do?
You should go to a gay bar.

04:01.442 --> 04:02.976
Wait. What?
You need

04:03.010 --> 04:05.413
to find out what's okay to say
and not to say,

04:05.446 --> 04:07.281
and what all these words mean.

04:07.315 --> 04:08.449
It's like how I used

04:08.482 --> 04:09.950
to have nothing to say
to Cockney Carl

04:09.983 --> 04:11.419
while he was repairing my mower.

04:11.452 --> 04:12.853
Then I learned some
Cockney rhyming slang.

04:12.886 --> 04:15.889
(Cockney accent):
Na we can rabbit and pork
aw the nickel and dime.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.459
Yeah, would you come with me?

04:18.492 --> 04:22.430
I have always wanted to know
what goes on in those places.

04:22.463 --> 04:23.431
Who buys the drinks?

04:23.464 --> 04:25.433
Do they have a women's bathroom,

04:25.466 --> 04:26.667
or just twice as many urinals?

04:26.700 --> 04:29.970
If you say to the bartender,
"I'm in the mood for some nuts,"

04:30.003 --> 04:31.372
what do you get?

04:32.440 --> 04:34.342
When you think about it,
I'm super gay-curious.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.410
Aw, but I'm right
in the middle of a game.

04:36.444 --> 04:39.647
Against yourself?
I'm very evenly matched.
I'm guaranteed to win.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.315
I'm the perfect opponent.

04:41.349 --> 04:42.483
You're also guaranteed to lose.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.785
True. I hate losing.

04:44.818 --> 04:46.320
Okay.

04:46.354 --> 04:48.389
I offer myself a draw.

04:48.422 --> 04:50.924
Draw accepted.

04:50.958 --> 04:52.326
Let's go.

04:54.828 --> 04:56.997
(dance music playing)

05:00.534 --> 05:02.603
Huh.
What?

05:02.636 --> 05:03.771
I don't know.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.639
I assumed
there'd be more...

05:05.673 --> 05:07.941
hot pants.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.410
Burt?

05:09.443 --> 05:09.977
Steve!

05:10.010 --> 05:11.479
Guy!

05:11.512 --> 05:14.382
What are the odds
that two other straight...

05:14.415 --> 05:16.417
Wait a minute.

05:16.450 --> 05:19.520
Are you telling me my wholesale
flower vendors are gay?

05:19.553 --> 05:20.287
Guilty.

05:21.088 --> 05:22.423
What are you doing here?
Are you...

05:22.456 --> 05:24.892
No, my son's nervous
to meet someone,

05:24.925 --> 05:26.460
so I just thought
I'd offer support.

05:26.494 --> 05:28.496
Oh, he's your son.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.064
We were saying
you could do a lot better.

05:31.098 --> 05:32.600
(laughs)

05:34.502 --> 05:35.469
Let us buy you a drink.

05:35.503 --> 05:36.404
Okay.

05:36.437 --> 05:38.439
Bye, Jimmy. Good luck.

05:38.472 --> 05:40.674
Here I thought the most
interesting thing

05:40.708 --> 05:43.377
about you was you
were a guy named Guy.

05:43.411 --> 05:45.879
Ooh, I've got
oodles of secrets.

05:45.913 --> 05:47.715
And I've got oodles of time.

05:47.748 --> 05:48.982
I think.

05:49.016 --> 05:52.720
"Oodles" is a gay form
of measurement, right?

05:52.753 --> 05:55.556
JIMMY: While Dad was getting
to know some old friends better,

05:55.589 --> 05:57.458
I went to work.

05:57.491 --> 05:59.527
That's amazing.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.862
So, "glory hole" has nothing
to do with a donut.

06:01.895 --> 06:03.431
Oh, I get it.

06:03.464 --> 06:05.699
Is it true you guys
wax the fellas?

06:05.733 --> 06:08.436
I have a lot of dreams
about dolphins.

06:08.469 --> 06:09.437
Does that mean anything?

06:09.470 --> 06:10.904
So, if you bite me,

06:10.938 --> 06:13.607
there's absolutely no chance
I'll turn gay?

06:13.641 --> 06:16.544
Oh, maybe I did just make
that up in my head.

06:16.577 --> 06:17.778
Oh, I get it!

06:17.811 --> 06:19.480
A bear's a guy.

06:19.513 --> 06:21.415
Ah, that makes
way more sense.

06:21.449 --> 06:23.417
Well, you know, it's
not nearly as impressive.

06:23.451 --> 06:24.785
Well, of course, I mean,

06:24.818 --> 06:27.521
who wouldn't want
a shower made out of gold?

06:35.763 --> 06:37.130
Where were you?

06:37.164 --> 06:38.566
It's so late.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.568
I was at a gay bar with Jimmy.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.936
I was having so much fun,
I just lost track of time.

06:45.539 --> 06:46.707
(sighs)

06:46.740 --> 06:49.577
You were where?

06:49.610 --> 06:50.578
It was amazing, Virginia.

06:50.611 --> 06:51.545
It changed my life.

06:51.579 --> 06:52.780
Changed my life!

06:52.813 --> 06:54.548
Changed your life how?

06:54.582 --> 06:55.816
It was fabulous.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.485
I could order
those fruity drinks I love

06:57.518 --> 06:59.219
without feeling judged
by some breeder.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.654
Breeder?

07:00.688 --> 07:02.623
That's me and you
because we make babies.

07:02.656 --> 07:03.791
Oh.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.125
I'm telling you,
this place was incredible.

07:05.158 --> 07:07.060
Get this: I fast-danced.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.529
You fast-danced?

07:08.562 --> 07:09.597
In public?

07:09.630 --> 07:11.632
You hate fast-dancing in public.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.133
That's because there's
always women around that I know

07:13.166 --> 07:15.469
are making fun of the way
my shoulders go up and down.

07:15.503 --> 07:19.206
But at The Polka Dot,
there's no women.

07:23.176 --> 07:26.179
You look like you're trying
to shake a lizard off your back.

07:26.213 --> 07:27.781
That's just what
a woman would say.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.182
But at The Polka Dot,

07:29.216 --> 07:31.151
they just make a circle
around you and clap.

07:31.184 --> 07:32.252
I can't wait till next Thursday.

07:32.285 --> 07:35.656
So, while I'm at Bunko,
your Thursday night thing's

07:35.689 --> 07:37.257
going to be hanging out
at a gay bar?

07:37.290 --> 07:38.692
Is it too weird?

07:38.726 --> 07:39.727
It's weird, isn't it?

07:40.861 --> 07:42.162
No.

07:42.195 --> 07:43.363
I have my thing with the ladies.

07:43.396 --> 07:45.533
I guess you should get to have
your thing with the boys.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.034
Thanks.

07:47.067 --> 07:50.237
And don't worry: I'll always
be the same guy you married.

07:53.006 --> 07:55.142
(sighs)

07:58.646 --> 08:00.714
Do you think it be weird
if I shaved my chest?

08:00.748 --> 08:03.584
Some of the other guys
are doing it.

08:03.617 --> 08:05.185
Give it a try.

08:11.759 --> 08:13.627
Okay, two words.

08:15.563 --> 08:16.697
Freddy Mercury.

08:16.730 --> 08:18.732
You got it, Jimmy.

08:18.766 --> 08:20.233
I'm turning in my gay card.

08:20.267 --> 08:22.135
'Cause Freddy Mercury is gay.
Yeah, I-I got that.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.572
Even though he never
came out publicly,

08:24.605 --> 08:25.973
after his death,
he became a gay icon.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.308
I'm sure he and Rock Hudson
are laughing about it

08:28.341 --> 08:30.177
over Cosmopolitans
in gay heaven right now.

08:30.210 --> 08:31.579
Rumor has it

08:31.612 --> 08:32.980
it's somewhere
above Palm Springs.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.014
Am I right, fellas?

08:35.749 --> 08:36.550
Oh, ho, ho.

08:36.584 --> 08:39.620
Well, as much
as we love charades,

08:39.653 --> 08:42.923
there's another reason
why we came to visit.

08:42.956 --> 08:45.693
Remember how in high school
you were so generous

08:45.726 --> 08:46.727
and let borrow your leggings
when I went through

08:46.760 --> 08:48.596
my Elizabeth Berkley
Showgirls phase?

08:48.629 --> 08:50.063
Oh, my God, I still think

08:50.097 --> 08:51.264
you would have been better
in that movie than she was.

08:51.298 --> 08:52.265
Oh, I agree.

08:52.299 --> 08:54.334
Thank you.

08:54.367 --> 08:55.335
But now we want
to borrow something

08:55.368 --> 08:57.270
even more important of yours:

08:57.304 --> 08:58.271
an egg and your uterus.

08:58.305 --> 08:59.339
What?
What?

08:59.372 --> 09:01.241
We want to have a family,
but we're both sterile.

09:01.274 --> 09:02.943
If you ever spend
time in Africa,

09:02.976 --> 09:04.244
do not wear
glow-in-the-dark G-strings

09:04.277 --> 09:05.579
that you bought on the street.

09:05.613 --> 09:06.546
They don't have an FDA there.
Uh...

09:06.580 --> 09:08.616
Anyway, Elijah's brother
said he would donate

09:08.649 --> 09:10.951
and I figured you're like
a sister to me, so...

09:10.984 --> 09:12.986
Friends.
Acquaintances, really.

09:15.723 --> 09:16.690
Yes.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.191
Of course I will, yes.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.760
Oh, my God, really?
Yes.

09:19.793 --> 09:20.728
I love you.

09:20.761 --> 09:24.164
(all screaming in joy)

09:29.402 --> 09:33.941
So, you agreed to rent out
your fiance's uterus?

09:33.974 --> 09:35.108
I wouldn't
call it "renting."

09:35.142 --> 09:36.376
They're not paying us.

09:36.409 --> 09:39.780
So, you agreed to let someone
freeload on her uterus' couch?

09:39.813 --> 09:40.580
That's even worse.

09:40.614 --> 09:42.916
Well, I didn't agree
to anything.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.284
I just lost the argument.

09:44.317 --> 09:45.753
(clears throat)

09:45.786 --> 09:47.120
I just thought we
would have discussed it

09:47.154 --> 09:48.756
before you agreed
to have another man's baby.

09:48.789 --> 09:49.790
Oh, my God, you're right.

09:49.823 --> 09:52.159
Yeah, I mean, we're engaged.

09:52.192 --> 09:53.661
We should talk
about these things.

09:53.694 --> 09:56.329
Let's just discuss this
in a reasonable manner.

09:56.363 --> 09:57.264
Here are my pros:

09:57.297 --> 09:59.132
Jordan and Elijah
would make great fathers.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.834
Hope would have a cousin.

10:00.868 --> 10:02.235
For nine months
I'd have huge boobs.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.737
Let's hear the cons.

10:03.771 --> 10:05.639
All right, uh, here we go.

10:05.673 --> 10:07.274
Number one,

10:07.307 --> 10:09.309
when I think about you doing it,
it makes my tummy hurt...

10:12.012 --> 10:13.113
And now, I'm realizing
I shouldn't have numbered these

10:13.146 --> 10:14.147
because that's it.

10:14.181 --> 10:15.649
Okay.

10:15.683 --> 10:18.051
Looks like
I'm having their baby.

10:19.753 --> 10:22.923
Your problem is you're trying
to win an argument with words.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.825
We're not word people, Jimmy.

10:24.858 --> 10:28.395
We're more... uh...

10:32.165 --> 10:34.101
th...

10:34.134 --> 10:35.202
Listen,

10:35.235 --> 10:36.837
within our family,

10:36.870 --> 10:38.138
we can debate each other

10:38.171 --> 10:39.807
because none of us
is that great with words.

10:39.840 --> 10:40.841
It's a fair fight.

10:40.874 --> 10:42.943
But out there
in the world,

10:42.976 --> 10:45.713
there are people
who can use words as weapons.

10:45.746 --> 10:46.814
They're crafty.

10:46.847 --> 10:49.349
That's close,
but not quite right.

10:50.718 --> 10:51.852
You'll never win an argument
with Sabrina

10:51.885 --> 10:54.221
unless you learn how to be...

10:58.325 --> 10:59.192
Trickerish.

10:59.226 --> 11:00.694
I like it.

11:00.728 --> 11:01.695
Trickerish.

11:01.729 --> 11:03.363
You need to learn
how to be more trickerish.

11:03.396 --> 11:05.198
Trickerisher.
Trickerisher.

11:05.232 --> 11:07.835
But I already said
that she could have the baby.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.803
But what if Jordan and Elijah

11:09.837 --> 11:12.139
change their minds?

11:12.172 --> 11:13.774
That is very offensive,
Virginia.

11:13.807 --> 11:15.308
They were born this way.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.844
Not about being gay.
We need to

11:16.877 --> 11:20.147
get them to change their minds
about wanting a baby.

11:20.180 --> 11:23.316
That is the definition
of trickerish.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.252
JIMMY:
So we came up with a plan
to make Jordan

11:25.285 --> 11:27.187
and Elijah realize they'd be
giving up their fabulous life

11:27.220 --> 11:28.989
if they had a baby.

11:29.022 --> 11:32.893
And the best day to do that on
was Gay Christmas.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.361
Or Halloween as we call it.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.163
Step 1 was dressing Hope up

11:36.196 --> 11:38.131
as something Jordan and Elijah
couldn't resist.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.771
And step 2 was making sure

11:43.804 --> 11:46.273
that Sabrina
was out of the way.

11:46.306 --> 11:47.174
James.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.508
Didn't you see

11:48.541 --> 11:50.210
the costume sign-up sheet?

11:50.243 --> 11:51.945
I already called
"Buying-in-Bulk Hulk."

11:51.979 --> 11:53.914
Oh.
You better just go home

11:53.947 --> 11:55.916
because you wouldn't like me
when I'm angry.

11:55.949 --> 11:57.851
(growls)

11:57.885 --> 11:58.952
I'll call somebody else in.

11:58.986 --> 12:02.189
Hey, you know,
Sabrina's available.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.356
Step 3:...
(doorbell rings)

12:03.390 --> 12:05.826
(growls):
Trick or treat.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.861
...set the bait.
Oh...

12:07.895 --> 12:08.796
Jimmy, she's so cute.

12:08.829 --> 12:09.797
(phone rings)
Ooh.

12:09.830 --> 12:13.200
Hello. What?

12:13.233 --> 12:14.802
A fire at the orphanage?

12:14.835 --> 12:16.436
JIMMY:
I'm on my way.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.138
Hey, guys, can you help me out?

12:18.171 --> 12:20.073
I'm a volunteer fireman,
and I don't have time to drop...

12:20.107 --> 12:21.274
Just go, go, go.
We got her.

12:22.442 --> 12:23.476
Bring back some calendars.

12:24.277 --> 12:25.946
JIMMY:
Step 4:

12:25.979 --> 12:28.882
pull the pin and wait
for the explosion.

12:28.916 --> 12:30.951
(Hope crying)

12:44.865 --> 12:46.967
You're dressing as a mailman?

12:47.000 --> 12:48.836
I'm one of the Village People.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.503
There's no mailman
in the Village People.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.405
I know there isn't.
I was gonna say...

12:52.439 --> 12:54.574
I added a mailman
to the Village People

12:54.607 --> 12:56.877
'cause I deliver
the biggest package.

12:58.045 --> 12:59.312
Is that weird for a straight guy

12:59.346 --> 13:01.248
to say to another guy
in a gay bar?

13:01.281 --> 13:03.984
No, I think we're still
on the good side of weird here.

13:04.017 --> 13:05.819
So for Bunko night,

13:05.853 --> 13:06.820
you dressed up as...

13:06.854 --> 13:09.857
a lady with a spaghetti stain
on her pants?

13:09.890 --> 13:13.126
No, they called off Bunko
'cause it's Halloween.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.428
Oh. Oh, I didn't know...

13:15.462 --> 13:17.130
Well, maybe I shouldn't...

13:18.932 --> 13:20.901
...go.

13:20.934 --> 13:21.902
No, you should go.

13:21.935 --> 13:24.337
What if the Indian needs
to send an urgent letter

13:24.371 --> 13:26.006
to the construction guy?

13:26.039 --> 13:28.175
I'll just give candy to the
kids. You know I love that.

13:28.208 --> 13:29.843
Cool. I'd bring you with me,

13:29.877 --> 13:31.611
but all the other
married guys' wives

13:31.644 --> 13:32.880
don't even know they're there.

13:39.252 --> 13:41.188
Have fun.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.224
GIRL:
Trick or treat.

13:45.192 --> 13:47.527
Just take the whole thing.

13:47.560 --> 13:48.962
I'm going to bed.

13:52.265 --> 13:53.333
HOPE:
Num-num! Num-num!

13:53.366 --> 13:54.634
JORDAN:
Honey, stop.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.636
(both talking over each other)
HOPE: Num-num!

13:56.669 --> 13:57.837
(moped whirring)

14:01.408 --> 14:03.176
Hey, what are you doing here?

14:03.210 --> 14:05.946
We had to close the store early.
Barney had a toxic reaction

14:05.979 --> 14:07.314
to all the green body paint
he was wearing.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.216
(screaming)

14:10.583 --> 14:14.021
It's burning.
My face is burning.

14:14.054 --> 14:15.855
(screaming)

14:25.198 --> 14:26.233
So I thought
I'd drop off my moped

14:26.266 --> 14:28.168
and go meet Jordan and Elijah
at the Polka Dot.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.970
What are you doing here?

14:30.003 --> 14:32.105
You know, Hope got tired
of trick or treating,

14:32.139 --> 14:34.007
so I left her with my mom,

14:34.041 --> 14:37.077
and then I came back
to, uh, to scare some kids.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.112
Seems like the type
of thing a...

14:39.146 --> 14:41.181
normal 25-year-old man
would do.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.082
No, it's fun. Watch.

14:42.115 --> 14:44.117
(screams)

14:44.151 --> 14:46.119
(groans)

14:48.088 --> 14:49.522
Nice.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.092
So you wanna come
to the Polka Dot,

14:52.125 --> 14:53.560
or do you wanna
scare more kids?

14:53.593 --> 14:56.096
(groans):
Polka Dot.

14:56.129 --> 14:58.131
(dance music playing)

15:09.276 --> 15:11.044
Hey, nice costume, pal.

15:11.078 --> 15:13.313
Not many people
can pull off Hitler.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.550
Hey. Uh, listen, buddy.

15:17.584 --> 15:20.387
I... Virginia?

15:20.420 --> 15:21.488
Sorry.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.223
Am I ruining guys' night?

15:23.256 --> 15:24.992
No, thank God it's you.

15:25.025 --> 15:27.027
Good. 'Cause I missed you.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.096
Besides I really
wanted to see you dance.

15:29.129 --> 15:31.264
Then I must be a cat
stuck in a tree

15:31.298 --> 15:32.399
and the fire truck is here,

15:32.432 --> 15:34.434
'cause it is time
for me to get down!

15:38.438 --> 15:41.174
I can't believe how long
we had to stand in that line.

15:41.208 --> 15:42.976
I know. This place
gets really crowded

15:43.010 --> 15:44.211
when you're allowed
to wear a mask.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.315
Hey, wait. Is that your dad?

15:48.348 --> 15:49.749
JIMMY:
Yeah.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.218
I've never seen him happier.

15:55.022 --> 15:56.223
Okay, that's a little much.

15:58.658 --> 16:00.193
Dad.

16:00.227 --> 16:02.029
I think you might have had
a little too much to...

16:03.030 --> 16:04.164
Mom?

16:04.197 --> 16:05.598
That's right.
I'm here,

16:05.632 --> 16:07.000
we're queer.

16:07.034 --> 16:08.101
Get used to it.

16:08.135 --> 16:09.436
Whoa.
Wait a second.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.471
If you guys are here,

16:11.504 --> 16:13.140
then who's watching Hope?

16:13.173 --> 16:15.008
Okay, I admit it:
I made a mistake.

16:15.042 --> 16:17.044
I'll just tell them
I'm sorry.

16:17.077 --> 16:19.079
No, Jimmy, you ruined Halloween
for two gay men.

16:19.112 --> 16:20.013
"Sorry" is not gonna cut it.

16:20.047 --> 16:22.049
(shrill scream)

16:23.483 --> 16:25.385
(woman screams)

16:25.418 --> 16:27.020
Where's Hope?

16:27.054 --> 16:29.156
Sleeping.
Oh, so sweet.

16:29.189 --> 16:32.692
She didn't scream
the whole time?
Oh, she screamed.

16:32.725 --> 16:34.661
JORDAN:
We had to find a way
to stop her from screaming,

16:34.694 --> 16:37.130
and believe me,
we tried everything.

16:37.164 --> 16:38.198
(crying)

16:38.231 --> 16:40.033
Eventually,
when we calmed down,

16:40.067 --> 16:42.102
we realized we'd learned
how to deal with this

16:42.135 --> 16:43.136
from all the parenting books
we'd read.

16:43.170 --> 16:45.072
You read parenting books?

16:45.105 --> 16:46.473
(laughing):
Yeah.

16:46.506 --> 16:49.076
Who'd have a child
without doing the research?

16:49.109 --> 16:50.477
Um, maybe someone
who's prepared to make

16:50.510 --> 16:52.079
a series of hopefully
entertaining mistakes.

16:53.180 --> 16:54.314
Well, anyway,
because of her age,

16:54.347 --> 16:55.348
and the behavior
she was exhibiting,

16:55.382 --> 16:58.118
we realized that what she
wanted was her pacifier.

16:58.151 --> 17:00.187
ELIJAH:
And we knew we could settle her
down by just getting one.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.188
But then we thought:

17:01.221 --> 17:02.555
that was just helping us.

17:02.589 --> 17:05.725
So we decided to wean her
off of it entirely.

17:05.758 --> 17:07.260
We read that going cold turkey
on the pacifier

17:07.294 --> 17:09.396
could be traumatizing
for a child.
But...

17:09.429 --> 17:11.064
what if we could find a num-num

17:11.098 --> 17:12.699
that would gradually
go away on its own?

17:12.732 --> 17:14.101
Got it!

17:14.134 --> 17:17.104
(Hope screaming)

17:17.137 --> 17:19.172
(Hope stops screaming)

17:19.739 --> 17:20.807
Yay!

17:22.142 --> 17:23.143
Pop! Pop-pop-pop!

17:28.215 --> 17:29.416
Patty-cake!

17:29.449 --> 17:31.218
Right there.
You know patty-cake?

17:34.254 --> 17:36.256
JORDAN:
And once we got past
the whole num-num issue,

17:36.289 --> 17:38.525
we were able to relax
and have a great time

17:38.558 --> 17:40.127
with your fantastic daughter.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.661
(laughing)
Ah!

17:43.163 --> 17:45.265
Wow. That's amazing!

17:45.298 --> 17:46.733
I've been trying to get her
to kick the habit,

17:46.766 --> 17:48.568
and it looks like
you guys did it.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.137
You guys are good at this.

17:50.170 --> 17:52.239
You guys are gonna be
such great dads.

17:52.272 --> 17:54.807
Well... if we get a baby
as great as Hope.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.143
Uh, hint, hint.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.577
You guys want to keep Hope?

17:57.610 --> 17:58.611
No.

17:58.645 --> 18:00.280
But we want one
just like her.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.115
We were talking about it,

18:02.149 --> 18:03.583
and is there any way
you'd consider being our donor

18:03.616 --> 18:04.784
instead of Elijah's brother?

18:05.785 --> 18:07.154
What?
SABRINA:
Wait.

18:07.187 --> 18:09.122
If you're using my egg,

18:09.156 --> 18:10.223
and Jimmy's sperm,

18:10.257 --> 18:11.424
aren't we just

18:11.458 --> 18:13.560
having a baby
that we're giving to you?

18:13.593 --> 18:15.262
No, that'd be too weird.

18:15.295 --> 18:16.796
Ugh.
And, um...
to be honest,

18:16.829 --> 18:18.598
you weren't Elijah's
first choice anyway.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.300
ELIJAH:
Not that you aren't great.

18:20.333 --> 18:21.468
(laughs)

18:21.501 --> 18:23.136
It's just that Petra's
so much better.

18:23.170 --> 18:24.837
Petra?
Our barista.

18:24.871 --> 18:25.838
She's tall,

18:25.872 --> 18:27.274
has gorgeous blonde hair...

18:27.307 --> 18:28.608
A barista?

18:28.641 --> 18:30.577
I'm losing out
to a barista?

18:30.610 --> 18:32.745
Aren't you a cashier
at a grocery store?

18:32.779 --> 18:34.214
Yeah.

18:34.247 --> 18:35.615
But I do that ironically.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.184
Wow.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.319
I am honored that
you guys would ask.

18:39.352 --> 18:41.288
Wha...
I'll do it!

18:41.321 --> 18:43.156
Really?
Yes.

18:43.190 --> 18:44.123
We're having a baby!

18:46.226 --> 18:47.327
(screaming)

18:47.360 --> 18:49.196
Whoo!

18:49.229 --> 18:51.331
(yelling excitedly)

18:51.364 --> 18:52.632
How does this work with Petra?

18:52.665 --> 18:53.833
Do I call her?

18:53.866 --> 18:55.568
Do you call her? I mean...

19:02.409 --> 19:04.444
You should come look at Hope
while she's sleeping.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.879
She looks just like
a little angel.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.281
Imagine something that cute

19:08.315 --> 19:10.317
that could also work
an espresso machine.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.619
Okay, first of all,
this Petra?

19:12.652 --> 19:15.288
She's steaming milk,
not splitting atoms.

19:15.322 --> 19:16.289
Second of all...

19:16.323 --> 19:17.957
Jimmy...

19:17.990 --> 19:20.193
I thought we were going
to talk about big decisions

19:20.227 --> 19:22.629
before we went and just...
made them.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.731
You're right. You're right.
That was a rash decision.

19:24.764 --> 19:26.966
We totally should've
done pros and cons.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.701
Pros: they'll be great fathers.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.570
Instead of a cousin,
Hope will have a half-sister.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.439
And you won't have
any stretch marks.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.375
Wow, I've actually got pros.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.344
This is fun when you have pros.

19:37.377 --> 19:38.778
Okay, what are the cons?

19:46.018 --> 19:47.387
I got nothing.

19:47.420 --> 19:49.256
Really?

19:49.289 --> 19:50.423
I won an argument with words?

19:51.458 --> 19:53.393
It looks that way.
Cool.

19:53.426 --> 19:56.229
Well, let's go and tell
the guys the good news.

19:56.263 --> 19:57.764
Um... no, you go ahead.

19:57.797 --> 20:00.267
I... I don't feel so good.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.534
(sighs)

20:03.536 --> 20:05.538
Are you sick?

20:07.407 --> 20:09.309
I don't know.

20:09.342 --> 20:12.211
This whole thing just kind of
makes my stomach hurt.

20:14.981 --> 20:16.783
You know what?

20:16.816 --> 20:18.618
I don't think I want
to be the sperm donor.

20:18.651 --> 20:20.353
Really?
Yeah.

20:20.387 --> 20:22.289
Look, I know how you feel.

20:22.322 --> 20:25.925
Sometimes you can't
explain or defend

20:25.958 --> 20:27.560
why you feel a certain way
about something,

20:27.594 --> 20:29.429
but that doesn't mean
you're not right.

20:29.462 --> 20:30.897
If this makes you feel weird,

20:30.930 --> 20:32.565
that's enough for me.

20:32.599 --> 20:33.533
You win.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.535
Thank you.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.337
God, Jimmy, I'm sorry.

20:37.370 --> 20:39.439
I mean, I really should
have done the same thing

20:39.472 --> 20:40.540
when you said your stomach hurt.

20:40.573 --> 20:41.641
It's okay.

20:41.674 --> 20:44.277
At least we got
a good story out of it.

20:44.311 --> 20:47.314
And the only person
I want to donate sperm to

20:47.347 --> 20:48.415
is you.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.951
That didn't sound as romantic
out loud as it did in my head.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.085
Mm-mm.

20:53.119 --> 20:55.322
I guess we should probably
go tell Jordan and Elijah.

20:55.355 --> 20:58.291
I can't believe I have
to deny people my sperm.

20:58.325 --> 21:01.428
I mean, there was a time
I couldn't give this stuff away.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.496
*

21:10.337 --> 21:12.439
(coughs lightly)

21:12.472 --> 21:13.740
(sneezes)

21:13.773 --> 21:15.508
This is starting
to get weird, isn't it?

21:15.542 --> 21:16.909
Yeah.

21:16.943 --> 21:19.312
Yeah, it's getting weird.
Let's get out of here.

21:19.346 --> 21:20.813
All right, but walk slow.

21:20.847 --> 21:22.849
The cucumber in my pants
is starting to slip.
