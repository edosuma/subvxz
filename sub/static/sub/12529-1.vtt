00:27.568 --> 00:31.989
Probe primary and auxiliary

00:32.156 --> 00:34.617
Shunt voltage three zero.

D.S.N. uplink rate is now 61.101.

00:39.831 --> 00:41.874

can better that for you.

00:41.999 --> 00:44.043
This is the probe's

00:44.168 --> 00:46.379
We need all the data we can get.

00:46.504 --> 00:51.509
Uh, standby.
We're getting a low current level here.

00:51.634 --> 00:55.179
Voltage is down to, uh, 185.

Here's our rock, fellas. One-one-niner.

00:59.100 --> 01:01.227

01:04.688 --> 01:06.732
-Can you repo the solar arrays?
-[Man #2] Uh, negative.

-Well, people, congratulations.
-[Smattering Of Applause]

01:22.707 --> 01:26.043

in the Santa Barbara shootout.

02:22.691 --> 02:24.610

02:27.404 --> 02:29.615
I want it for the 6:00.
It's no good at 10:00. You got that?

-It's no good at 10:00.
-What are you, a parrot? Get movin'.

02:32.743 --> 02:36.247
I want footage of that 1st Monument Bank

-Van Gundy?

02:38.415 --> 02:40.543
-Sir!
-And get that security camera's

02:40.668 --> 02:42.795
-Yeah, mm-hmm.
-No tape, no story.

02:42.920 --> 02:45.548
You got it, boss.
Whatever you say, boss.

02:45.673 --> 02:49.969

with all the top brass involved.

02:57.768 --> 03:00.896
Oh, take Brace with you. It's a good
story for her to cut her teeth on.

03:01.021 --> 03:04.817
Brace? Are you sure? Because I usually
produce Brace's on-camera segments.

03:04.942 --> 03:08.654
We're a team. I mean, we're more
than a team. Brace and I are--

03:08.779 --> 03:11.365
You and my daughter are what?

03:15.744 --> 03:19.415
-Um, nothing.
-That's right.

03:19.540 --> 03:22.334
I didn't send Brace to all those
fancy English boarding schools...

03:22.460 --> 03:25.796
to wind up with the likes of you.

03:25.921 --> 03:30.009

the dangers of sunbathing, yadda, yadda.

03:45.941 --> 03:50.613
Something to fill time
if my idiot weatherman runs short.

03:52.990 --> 03:55.993
Mr. Channing? Mr. Channing?
Excuse me. Sir?

03:56.118 --> 04:01.040
You hired me because I had ten years'
experience as a newspaper reporter.

04:01.165 --> 04:05.044
Now, I will go to the ends of the Earth
to bring you a great story.

04:05.169 --> 04:08.214
But I need the chance.

04:08.339 --> 04:13.302
You know, Tim, when I look at you,
I see myself at your age.

04:13.427 --> 04:16.221
-Really?
-And I was a moron!

04:16.346 --> 04:19.725
-Huh.
-But you got a lot of nerve,

04:19.850 --> 04:22.394
Sometimes.
Okay, it's yours.

04:22.520 --> 04:24.855
-B-B-B-But you said--
-Shut up, Felix.

04:24.980 --> 04:27.191
You won't-- You won't regret this, sir.
You really won't.

04:27.316 --> 04:31.654

thing, you're fired. Is that clear?

04:59.515 --> 05:01.433

-We're here
at Vandenberg Air Force Base,

05:03.978 --> 05:07.857

the shuttle Atlantis will be

05:07.982 --> 05:09.942
-on the west coast.
-I understand that Project Deadhead...

05:10.067 --> 05:14.280
I understand that Project Deadhead
is carrying a sophisticated satellite...

05:14.405 --> 05:18.033
-to study the Fiona comet.
-to study the Fiona comet.

05:18.159 --> 05:21.120
Yes, the satellite has
a specialized guidance system...

05:21.245 --> 05:24.582
which will allow it to pass
closer to the comet than ever before.

05:24.707 --> 05:26.625
Yeah, yeah.
Is Jerry Garcia on board?

05:26.750 --> 05:28.919
What?

05:29.044 --> 05:32.214
Is Jerry Garcia on board?

05:32.339 --> 05:35.926
Is Jerry Garcia on board?

05:36.051 --> 05:39.221
-Well, yes, actually.
-Yes!

05:39.346 --> 05:41.974
Project Deadhead
gets its name from the fact...

05:42.099 --> 05:45.644
that its payload includes
the ashes of famous rocker...

05:45.769 --> 05:47.813
Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead.

05:47.938 --> 05:49.982
How in the world
did you know that?

05:50.107 --> 05:52.818
-It's my job to know that.
-It's my job to know these things.

All right, Brace, here we go.
The big wrap-up.

06:20.304 --> 06:23.432
-And so, on this the night
of the Fiona Comet,

06:23.557 --> 06:26.185
the night of the Fiona Comet,
our thoughts turn...

06:26.310 --> 06:29.688
to that satellite's only passenger--
Jerry Garcia.

06:29.814 --> 06:33.984
-I'm Brace Channing--

06:47.790 --> 06:51.877
-Tim, I'd like a word with you.
-And I'm dead.

06:53.295 --> 06:56.715
-Colonel?
-Yes?

06:56.841 --> 07:00.219
-You might want to take
a look at this, sir.

07:00.344 --> 07:03.389
-So what?
-It's changing direction, sir.

07:03.514 --> 07:06.559
That's impossible. Are you sure it's not
the trajectory of our own satellite?

07:06.684 --> 07:10.229
Yes, sir. Uh, the comet's
just changed direction again, sir.

07:10.354 --> 07:12.648
-It's gotta be the equipment.
-I've got down line confirmation.

07:12.773 --> 07:15.818
No, sir. Our backup computers
verify all systems go.

07:15.943 --> 07:18.737
It's-- It's coming down, sir.

07:18.863 --> 07:22.741
-The satellite?
-No, sir. The comet.

07:22.867 --> 07:24.910
Okay, let's go to general alert.

-What's this?
-It's Capt. Dalton's telephone number.

07:39.633 --> 07:42.595
Well, he's not really my type, but--

07:42.720 --> 07:45.264
-You made me look such an idiot.
-Brace, come on.

-O'Hara here. Please leave a message.

13:49.420 --> 13:54.049
-[Answering Machine Beeps]
-Channing here. You're fired.

13:54.175 --> 13:56.427
-Short enough for ya?
-[Receiver Clicks]

13:56.552 --> 13:59.722
What more can I say?
When you're right, you're right!

14:01.098 --> 14:03.309
[Wheezing]

14:03.434 --> 14:08.397
[Coughing]

14:20.284 --> 14:22.244
[Electronic Whirring]

14:25.956 --> 14:28.209
[Gasps]
Hmm.

14:38.385 --> 14:41.263
[Groans]

14:46.769 --> 14:50.272
[Gasps]
Stay where you are, little Earth man,

14:50.397 --> 14:52.483
and no harm will come to you.

14:52.608 --> 14:56.028
Say, I wish I'd thought of that!

14:56.153 --> 14:59.865
-[Tim] Hello?
-What more can I say?

14:59.990 --> 15:02.493
-Be silent.
-How do you do it?

15:02.618 --> 15:05.162
I thought I told you to shut up.

15:05.287 --> 15:07.790
I couldn't agree with you more--
[Muffled]

15:07.915 --> 15:10.376
You leave me no choice.

15:10.501 --> 15:13.712
Who's there?
I got a gun!

15:26.851 --> 15:30.813
Static.
[Groans]

15:46.787 --> 15:51.542
-Hey, buddy. Hey. Hey.
-[Moans Softly]

15:51.667 --> 15:53.919
-Hey! [Grunts]
-That's it, Earthling!

15:54.044 --> 15:58.549
-[Grunting]
-It's alive!

16:00.176 --> 16:01.886
Hyah!

16:02.011 --> 16:05.389
Okay, you wanna play games?

16:05.514 --> 16:09.435
-Slide through.
-I must be going... [Grunts] nuts.

16:09.560 --> 16:13.189
[Laughs]
One strike, no balls.

16:13.314 --> 16:16.442
Over here, Tiger Woods.
[Chuckling]

16:16.567 --> 16:18.736
[Blows Raspberry]
Aaah!

16:18.861 --> 16:23.908
-Hey, look-- Jimmy Hoffa.
-Leisure suit from hell!

16:24.033 --> 16:26.785
[Whimpering]

16:26.911 --> 16:31.248
-I'm gonna...
-Ohh!

16:31.373 --> 16:33.417
mutilate you!

16:36.921 --> 16:40.424
Come on!
Show your face... if you have one.

16:43.928 --> 16:46.889
Where-- Where'd he go?

16:48.432 --> 16:54.480
What the heck
was in those brownies?

16:54.605 --> 16:57.149
When dealing with primitive life-forms,

16:57.274 --> 17:00.110
sometimes one must
resort to primitive acts.

17:00.236 --> 17:03.113
-Are you okay, Zoot?
-[Coughing]

17:03.239 --> 17:06.492
If you don't mind my asking,
where were you?

17:06.617 --> 17:08.285
Don't be such a wet blanket.

17:08.410 --> 17:11.454
Wait a minute.
Leave my mother out of this!

17:11.579 --> 17:13.624
It's your fault we ended up
on this no-good, carbon-based,

17:13.749 --> 17:16.752
-over-oxygenated,
miserable excuse of a--

17:16.877 --> 17:19.003
-[Woman] Tim?
-Oh, no. It's another one!

17:19.128 --> 17:21.840
I know you're not asleep yet.

17:21.965 --> 17:24.134
Tim, it's Lizzie!

17:24.260 --> 17:26.512
[Gasps]
Blotz! It's Lizzie!

17:26.637 --> 17:28.597
What's a Lizzie?

17:28.722 --> 17:31.517
I would say a Model T Ford,
but this one has better tires.

17:31.642 --> 17:35.187
-Ah-ooga! Ah-ooga!
-I know what a woman is,

17:35.312 --> 17:38.816
Help, Mr. Lifeguard, I'm drowning.
I need mouth-to-mouth.

17:38.941 --> 17:41.277
Ugh, saliva exchange.

17:41.402 --> 17:44.029
I would never partake
in such an unsanitary interaction.

17:44.154 --> 17:46.490
There must be some other way
to greet a female and then be rid of it.

17:46.615 --> 17:48.534
-[Knock On Door]
-Tim!

17:48.659 --> 17:50.953
If it was me, I'd be he.

17:51.078 --> 17:54.164
-Tim, please.
-Good thinking, Zoot.

18:12.641 --> 18:15.978
Okay, Tim,
I'm picking up the hide-a-key.

18:17.813 --> 18:21.942
-Gonna open the door.
-[Key Turning]

18:23.486 --> 18:26.322
-Tim?
-Lizzie!

18:26.447 --> 18:28.574
My dear friend or family member.

18:28.699 --> 18:31.076
Uh, oh, my gosh.

18:31.202 --> 18:34.079
Oh, inappropriate.

18:34.205 --> 18:39.251
-Oh, boy.
-[Zoot] I told you

18:39.376 --> 18:42.379
Lizzie, my dear friend
or family member.

18:42.505 --> 18:44.632
You sound funny.
Are you catching a cold?

18:44.757 --> 18:46.926
A cold, a virus?
[Deep Voice] Yes.

18:47.051 --> 18:49.470
[Voice Changing] A contagious
bubonic plague. You better leave.

18:49.595 --> 18:52.264
What? What in the world--

18:52.389 --> 18:55.434
Are-- Are you a Trekkie?

18:55.559 --> 18:58.562
Uh, yes, I am.

18:58.687 --> 19:01.107
Okay, what's going on?

19:01.232 --> 19:03.984
-What's going on?
-Tim, are you okay?

19:04.109 --> 19:06.403
-You don't seem like yourself.
-Oh, I'm Tim, all right.

19:06.529 --> 19:09.615
-Tim O'Hara, no reason to doubt it.
-Uh, what's going on?

19:09.740 --> 19:12.117
Lots.

19:17.414 --> 19:19.875
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

19:24.922 --> 19:27.633
-Lizzie.
-Yeah?

19:27.758 --> 19:30.761
If you're my sister,
an explanation is in order.

19:30.886 --> 19:34.014
[Chuckles]
Yeah.

19:34.139 --> 19:36.767
-Does this mean that you and I are--
-Indeed.

19:36.892 --> 19:40.604
-Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do, and you...

19:40.729 --> 19:42.815
-need...to go.
-Huh?

19:42.940 --> 19:46.026
Wha--

19:48.487 --> 19:51.991
-Human emotions.
-Crazy monkeys.

19:55.786 --> 19:58.372
[Humming]

19:58.497 --> 20:03.127
[Siren]

20:11.802 --> 20:16.307
-[Beeping]
-[Chattering]

20:18.350 --> 20:20.895
Welcome, sir.

20:22.688 --> 20:24.690
Where's Coleye?

20:24.815 --> 20:29.028
Examining mucus-type protoplasm.

20:31.155 --> 20:33.073
Hmm. It's saline-based.

20:33.199 --> 20:37.077
Good God, Coleye,
put that on a slide next time.

20:37.203 --> 20:40.539
I want this stuff analyzed
and the cigarette dusted for prints.

20:40.664 --> 20:44.752
-I want to know whose this was.
-There's more, sir.

20:46.128 --> 20:49.882
[Coleye]
Quadroped becomes... biped?

20:50.007 --> 20:52.885
It must have taken human form!

20:53.010 --> 20:55.387
The footprints stop at the road.

20:55.513 --> 20:57.515
We think someone
may have picked them up.

20:57.640 --> 21:00.017
Evidence of a crash,

21:00.142 --> 21:02.603
no spaceship and alien
in human form?

21:02.728 --> 21:05.231
It's just like the incident of '64!

21:05.356 --> 21:07.858
Keep your mouth shut, you idiot.

21:07.983 --> 21:10.236
That incident is not only classified,

21:10.361 --> 21:12.947
but it never happened, you got it?

21:13.072 --> 21:16.867
-Yes, sir.
-Once again, we have no alien, no U.F.O.

21:16.992 --> 21:19.245
If you can't get me either one,

21:19.370 --> 21:21.372
then you'd better start
looking for another job.

21:21.497 --> 21:24.124
Well, you heard him! Move it!
It's out there somewhere!

21:24.250 --> 21:26.252
-So, move it! Go! Move!
-Yes, sir!

21:26.377 --> 21:30.422
And God help the poor soul...

21:30.548 --> 21:32.883
who picked him up.

21:42.601 --> 21:44.937
[Screams]

21:45.062 --> 21:46.981
Silence, subculturer!

21:47.106 --> 21:51.277
-Let me down!
-Look what you did to me. Barbarian!

21:51.402 --> 21:53.612
-Let me down!
-As you wish!

21:53.737 --> 21:56.407
-[Electronic Buzz]
-[Screams, Crashes]

21:56.532 --> 21:58.576
[Grunts]

22:00.411 --> 22:03.831
For a thief,
you are extremely clumsy.

22:03.956 --> 22:07.460
-Thief? I'm not a thief.
-So I see.

22:07.585 --> 22:10.462
Tim O'Hara.
You are a reporter.

22:10.588 --> 22:13.132
Reporter? No.
I'm a producer, pal!

22:13.257 --> 22:16.510
-Let me tell ya, I-- Aaah!
-[Electronic Buzzing]

22:16.635 --> 22:20.472
Look, I didn't steal anything, okay?
I don't know what you're talking about.

22:20.598 --> 22:23.142
-All right, all right.
-[Electronic Buzzing]

22:23.267 --> 22:26.312
No! No!
[Coughing]

22:26.437 --> 22:29.482
Warning, Tim O'Hara. Any attempt
to expose me will be useless.

22:33.611 --> 22:38.324
-I think we use more than ten.
-Your astronauts

22:38.449 --> 22:41.452
Case closed.

22:43.287 --> 22:45.372
[Grunting]

22:45.497 --> 22:47.875
Okay. Okay, just--

22:48.000 --> 22:52.171
[Electronic Whirring]

22:55.132 --> 22:58.677
Whoa!

23:04.475 --> 23:08.354
Okay, it's just a dream.
It's a very bad dream.

23:08.479 --> 23:13.484
[Panting] Just-- Come on.
Wake up. Wake up!

23:13.609 --> 23:16.070
What's with that?

23:16.195 --> 23:20.366
-I believe it's called
a nervous breakdown.

23:20.491 --> 23:23.661
-I don't believe in aliens.
-I heard that!

23:23.786 --> 23:27.373
To us, you are the alien.

23:27.498 --> 23:30.209
If you must know,
I am from the planet you call Mars.

23:30.334 --> 23:34.380
-And what, I'm from Uranus? I never--
-I was getting to you!

23:34.505 --> 23:36.590
Don't get a crease in your Sputnik.

23:36.715 --> 23:38.884
[Zoot] Please,
just introduce me to monkey boy.

23:39.009 --> 23:43.055
This is my Zoot.

23:43.180 --> 23:46.725
-A polymorphous Zootenex 3,000.
-Just look, don't touch.

23:46.851 --> 23:50.229
-Your suit talks?
-[Scoffs] Incessantly.

23:50.354 --> 23:52.273
Corduroys talk,
nobody gives them grief.

23:52.398 --> 23:54.400
-[Zoot] Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.
-Mars? Wait a minute.

23:54.525 --> 23:58.362
[Stuttering] There's no life on Mars.
We've sent probes.

23:58.487 --> 24:02.032
I'd try to explain it, but you people
still think "E" equals "MC" squared.

24:02.158 --> 24:06.245
-You're still trying to
analyze our rocks. Ha-ha!

24:06.370 --> 24:09.915
Oh! Blasted sand particles.

24:10.040 --> 24:13.210
They've completely crystallized
the vortex generator.

24:13.335 --> 24:15.754
-Hey, do you mind?
-[Knock On Door]

24:15.880 --> 24:17.590
-[Gasps]
-Now what?

24:17.715 --> 24:20.050
-Thank God, an eyewitness.
-Eyewitness? Negative.

24:20.176 --> 24:24.263
-You must tell no one.
-No offence, but your ship is

24:24.388 --> 24:26.807
You're the biggest story
in the history of mankind!

24:26.932 --> 24:29.602
There is intelligent life
out there in the universe!

24:29.727 --> 24:31.437
I hope you're not including yourself
in that statement!

24:31.562 --> 24:34.273
Tim, listen, I'm sorry to bother you
so early in the morning,

24:34.398 --> 24:36.317
but I got a hold of your mail,
and I wanted--

24:36.442 --> 24:39.987
Could you just-- please, come here.
Take a look at that!

24:40.112 --> 24:42.990
[Tim]
Aaah!

24:43.115 --> 24:47.953
Tim, you definitely need a maid!
Oh, hello!

24:50.247 --> 24:55.086
-Greetings.
-Oh, I'm sorry to catch you

24:55.211 --> 24:58.839
-Pyjamas? [Muffled]
-[Stammering] Where's the spaceship?

24:58.964 --> 25:01.467
-[Mrs. Brown] Spaceship?
-Right here.

25:01.592 --> 25:04.512
Oh, for the rummage sale!
Does it come with an action figure?

25:04.637 --> 25:07.515
-You're looking at him.
-[Chuckles]

25:07.640 --> 25:10.643
-No, don't touch him! He's a Martian.
-Tim, what's going on?

25:10.768 --> 25:12.686
-[Stuttering]
-I beg your-- Mart-- Martin?

25:12.811 --> 25:15.314
-Yes. Martin.
-No, no, no, no!

25:15.439 --> 25:17.816
-He's a-- uh--
-Uncle!

25:17.942 --> 25:21.153
-Martin.
-Oh.

25:21.278 --> 25:24.323
-Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.
-He turns invisible, okay?

25:24.448 --> 25:26.367
His suit talks--
he's got a talking suit.

25:26.492 --> 25:28.494
He's got these things that
pop out of his head-- You just--

25:28.619 --> 25:30.996
-Show her. Go ahead.
Come on, give her the finger.

25:31.122 --> 25:35.501
No, I didn't mean that.
I don't know what I mean. Forget it.

25:35.626 --> 25:38.546
You'll have to forgive Tim, Mrs. Brown.
He lost his job last night,

25:38.671 --> 25:40.673
and he's experiencing
a nervous breakdown.

25:40.798 --> 25:42.883
Oh, poor dear.

25:43.008 --> 25:45.010
-I hope it doesn't affect the rent.
-[Laughing Hysterically]

25:45.136 --> 25:48.013
-Don't worry,
I'm here to look after him.

25:48.138 --> 25:51.976
He's very lucky to have
an uncle like you in his life, Martin.

25:52.101 --> 25:55.855
And you, Mrs. Brown,
are like a brilliant quasar

25:55.980 --> 25:59.149
Oh! Call me Lorelei.

25:59.275 --> 26:02.069
Lorelei.
The sound of...

26:02.194 --> 26:06.198
pure mountain spring water
from the centre of the Earth.

26:06.323 --> 26:08.951
Oh, my.
[Chuckles]

26:12.204 --> 26:16.083
-[Slurping]
-[Stammering]

26:16.208 --> 26:19.086
Oh!
[Chuckles]

26:19.211 --> 26:22.756
I obviously misconstrued a custom.
I apologize.

26:22.882 --> 26:26.218
I'm from... New York.

26:26.343 --> 26:29.180
No, actually, it's--
[Stuttering] It's fine.

26:29.305 --> 26:32.892
[Stuttering]
It's perfect. [Sighs]

26:33.017 --> 26:35.853
-Oh, brother.
-Oh, Martin?

26:35.978 --> 26:37.897
Yes, Lorelei?

26:38.022 --> 26:43.903
Um, Mr. Brown... passed away
several years ago.

26:44.028 --> 26:48.908
-I thought you might like to know that.
-Hmm.

26:49.033 --> 26:52.703
Au revoir.
[Chuckles]

26:52.828 --> 26:54.747
Hmm?

26:54.872 --> 26:57.291
Just for the record,
a handshake will do for me.

26:57.416 --> 26:59.418
[Scoffs]
You think that I actually enjoyed...

26:59.543 --> 27:01.587
tasting that female's exoskeleton?

27:01.712 --> 27:05.591
[Shudders] I merely used my data on
your primitive species to determine...

27:05.716 --> 27:08.052
the optimum way
to avoid suspicion.

27:08.177 --> 27:11.722
-Yeah, but what's the optimum
way to get home?

27:11.847 --> 27:16.227
I don't know, Zoot. Where on this
barbaric swamp of a planet...

27:16.352 --> 27:19.563
can we find the makings
of an electron accelerator?

27:19.688 --> 27:22.608
-[Zoot]
Maybe your new girlfriend has one.

27:22.733 --> 27:26.070
Excuse me. Fellas,
I don't mean to interrupt, but...

27:26.195 --> 27:31.283
I-I, you know, I think I might be able
to help you find that electron thing.

27:31.408 --> 27:33.077
We're toast.

27:33.285 --> 27:35.913
I don't believe this.
You really think you can...

27:36.038 --> 27:37.957
repair your ship
with all this junk?

27:38.082 --> 27:40.334
Everything has been carefully chosen
for its potential to fashion...

27:40.459 --> 27:42.962
a crude vortex electron accelerator.

27:43.087 --> 27:46.006
Except for this.
A pooper scooper.

27:46.132 --> 27:48.801
I have no idea what it does,
but it's fascinating.

27:48.926 --> 27:53.430
Excuse me. Where are your
nuclear implosion couplers?

27:53.556 --> 27:55.891
For a garden hose?

27:57.768 --> 28:00.646
I'm never going to get off
this infernal planet.

28:00.771 --> 28:02.940
[Zoot]
The I.Q. of a pancake.

28:03.065 --> 28:05.025
You're right. Humans are truly
the amoebas of the universe!

28:05.151 --> 28:07.695
Yeah, this from a guy
who talks to his tin foil suit.

28:07.820 --> 28:10.865
-Hey, what was that for?
-It wasn't me, it was Zoot.

28:10.990 --> 28:15.035
-[Zoot Laughing]
-Come here a sec.

28:15.161 --> 28:17.830
Listen, you've been on Earth,
what, all of ten minutes?

28:17.955 --> 28:20.332
-It's not so bad here.
-[Chuckles] That's what Neenurt said.

28:20.457 --> 28:24.336
-Who?
-Exactly. One of my planet's

28:24.461 --> 28:27.006
and now he's gone without a trace.

28:27.131 --> 28:30.843
He arrived on Earth in 1964,
and, I presume, was abducted

28:30.968 --> 28:33.053
I shudder to think what they did to him
in the name of science.

28:33.179 --> 28:37.391
-What are they laughing at?
-[Laughing] Hey, space man!

28:37.516 --> 28:40.519
-I've been discovered!
-[Electronic Buzz]

28:40.644 --> 28:43.147
-[Grunting]
-Sorry about that.

28:43.272 --> 28:44.899
-Oh, my--
-What happened?

28:45.024 --> 28:47.234
They don't know anything.
They were just making fun of your--

28:47.359 --> 28:50.738
Making fun. I'm one of
the best-dressed beings on my planet.

28:50.863 --> 28:52.865
[Man]
Yo, Elvis! Nice suit.

28:52.990 --> 28:57.203
Well, Dorothy, I hate to tell you this,
but you're not in Kansas any more.

28:57.328 --> 28:59.371
[Zoot] That's great.
The minute I turn my back,

28:59.497 --> 29:01.874
you're getting into
someone else's pants!

29:01.999 --> 29:05.002
[Martin] I need to blend in,
and you stand out like a putt

29:05.127 --> 29:07.046
[Zoot] I should have known
by the way you've been gawking...

29:07.171 --> 29:09.215
at every T-shirt
and sweat pant we pass.

29:09.340 --> 29:12.593
-Don't come apart at the seams!
-Why is Zoot always the last to know?

29:12.718 --> 29:15.054
-All right, all right, all right!
-[Zoot Sobbing]

29:15.179 --> 29:18.933
-Martian footage, take one.
-Zoot, this is tearing me apart too.

29:19.058 --> 29:21.852
[Zoot]
I know I'm not what I used to be.

29:21.977 --> 29:24.730
I mean, a stretch mark here,
a line stain there.

29:24.855 --> 29:27.107
[Zoot Sobbing]

29:27.233 --> 29:30.778
[Screams]

29:30.903 --> 29:33.572
-Hey!
-Pervert!

29:33.697 --> 29:36.700
It's not safe
for a woman around here!

29:36.826 --> 29:38.786
I'm ready to blend in now.

29:43.415 --> 29:46.710
-Outstanding.
-Martin, that outfit looks ridic--

29:46.836 --> 29:49.463
-Stylin', bro!
-Thanks, bro.

29:49.588 --> 29:51.590
[Chuckles]
Real cool.

29:51.715 --> 29:53.634
I've got the touch on two planets.

29:53.759 --> 29:56.053
I gotta get out more.
How did your Zoot take the--

29:56.178 --> 29:58.430
Zoot, he's highly intelligent.
He understands.

29:58.556 --> 30:01.934
Aaaah!
You used me, you buttonhole!

30:02.059 --> 30:06.105
-Go and have your fling.

-Huh? Oh, incoming.

-Tacky, huh?

Hey! Hey! What?

-Now turn the other cheek.

30:38.053 --> 30:40.264
All right, I'm bustin' out!

30:40.389 --> 30:42.349
-There.
-Go ahead, try 'em all on.

30:42.475 --> 30:45.811
See if I care.
Whoa!

30:45.936 --> 30:49.482
If love is a crime, lock me up!

30:49.607 --> 30:53.611
I'm guilty.
Look at her.

30:53.736 --> 30:56.280
A perfect size six,

30:56.405 --> 30:59.950
and never been worn!

31:00.076 --> 31:04.330
Darling, don't speak.
Just come to me. [Chuckles]

31:04.455 --> 31:08.167
Oh, this is crazy.
I'm a polymorph, and you're a polyester.

31:08.292 --> 31:11.212
Yes, you're synthetic,
but I like that in a girl!

31:11.337 --> 31:13.964
Give me some thread, baby!
[Kissing Sounds]

Look who's talking,
Mr. Clothes Horse!

31:26.977 --> 31:30.898
Now, in you go, or you'll take
a long walk on a short hanger.

Coming in for a landing!
Flaps down!

31:33.150 --> 31:36.987
-[Flatulent Sound]
-I said bag it, mister!

31:37.112 --> 31:40.491

have to throw me in the hamper.

-Help me, Tim!
-Mm-hmm.

No!
Give me that,

Why wouldn't you give
the kid a piece of gum?

32:26.245 --> 32:29.707
[Scoffs] Okay, sure, right.
Here, have one.

-Come on, let's go. No, no, come on.
-What are you doing?

-What are you doing?
-Trust me.

-Not the finger! Don't do the finger!
-Try some.

-Why?
-You don't want to try Martian gum?

32:38.758 --> 32:42.887
-No, not particularly.
-Afraid, Earthling?

32:50.060 --> 32:52.605
You know what, that is not bad.

-The centre's got
a nice little zing to it.

Hmm, no.
No, not really.

Aaaah!

-Everything okay in there?

-Yeeow.

33:24.470 --> 33:27.014
[Breathing Heavily]

33:27.139 --> 33:30.309
This "gum", as you call,
allows me to take on the outward

33:30.434 --> 33:32.436
On you, it has the reverse effect.

33:32.561 --> 33:35.523
Oh, so that's what you
really look like.

33:35.648 --> 33:38.651
Don't be disgusting.
That was Fluvian Nurplex.

33:38.776 --> 33:41.654
-Oh.
-We carry many different planets.

33:41.779 --> 33:46.826
If you think that was bad,
this is Veenox Seven.

-Oh, well, that's--
-Don't ever mess with a Veenox Seven.

All right, come on, the rest of you,
come on up on stage!

The sun, while you can get it.
The sand, the surf.

34:10.516 --> 34:13.476
Usually, the beach conjures up
images of our youth,

34:13.601 --> 34:17.815
but come on down to Sunset Pier today,
and your contraceptions of--

and be a doctor. I hate this!

-Feeling hot, hot, hot
-What do you think?

34:39.712 --> 34:41.714
I think your bathing suit
should have a top.

Cut! Cut! Cut!

of this divergence?

-I gotta see some friends.
-Negative! Exclamation point.

Do you have any idea
how fortunate you are?

has to be squeezed from rocks.

-Well, surf's up, dude.
-Tim, I'm so glad you came.

to know that it kills.

ever happened between us last night.

I have to go to the bathroom later.
Later.

52:02.213 --> 52:04.924
Um, glasses are in the kitchen.

52:05.049 --> 52:07.092
Why don't I go get them,
and you just...

52:07.217 --> 52:09.303
kind of make yourself at home.

52:09.428 --> 52:11.847
Okay.

52:14.016 --> 52:16.936
-Fantastic apartment, Tim.
-Thank you very much.

52:17.061 --> 52:19.230
-[Cork Pops]
-Ah, yeah, there we go.

52:19.355 --> 52:22.942
Oh! What a slob!

52:23.067 --> 52:28.072
[Humming]

52:29.448 --> 52:32.117
[Martin Grunting]
Cut it out!

52:32.243 --> 52:36.163
-Hey!
-Yes, let's fall in love

52:36.288 --> 52:38.332
-Ooh!
-Why shouldn't we

52:38.457 --> 52:41.752
-Fall in love
-Mmm, that's the spot.

52:41.877 --> 52:44.630
Let's take a chance

52:44.755 --> 52:48.759
-Ooh, yeah. Mmm.
-Why be afraid of it, ba-ba-doo-day

52:48.884 --> 52:51.178
-Let's close our eyes
-[Moaning]

52:51.303 --> 52:54.181
And make our own paradise

52:54.306 --> 52:59.353
-Little we know
-Oh, oh, no, harder, like before.

52:59.478 --> 53:02.523
-Ahhh.
-Oh, baby

53:02.648 --> 53:05.317
-Where's the wine?
-Uh, uh--

53:05.443 --> 53:09.196
Why shouldn't
we fall in love

53:09.321 --> 53:11.866
-I'll get it.
-Now is the time for it

53:11.991 --> 53:14.618
Let's fall in love

53:14.743 --> 53:16.704
You know, I asked Daddy
about giving you another chance.

53:16.829 --> 53:18.998
Oh, oh, good!

53:21.917 --> 53:25.713
-Here we go.
-Oh, lovely. Thanks.

53:28.466 --> 53:31.343
Hmm. You know, I thought
that crash of yours...

53:31.468 --> 53:33.679
might make a kind of
cute little story.

53:33.804 --> 53:36.849
-Oh, really? Good. That's--
-Mm-hmm.

53:36.974 --> 53:38.976
[Grunts]
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

53:39.101 --> 53:41.687
Cut it out!

53:41.812 --> 53:44.023
-What was that?
-Uh, I didn't hear anything.

53:44.148 --> 53:47.526
Tim, get rid of--
[Groaning]

53:47.651 --> 53:49.904
Are you all right?

53:50.029 --> 53:53.532
Yes, I just--
I really have to go to the bathroom.

53:53.657 --> 53:58.204
-Well, hurry back.
-[Chuckles]

53:58.329 --> 54:01.415
-Why shouldn't we fall in love
-Be a minute.

54:01.540 --> 54:04.210
-Now's the time while we're young
-[Sighs]

54:04.335 --> 54:08.005
Tim!
Get me outta here!

54:08.130 --> 54:10.841
Stop making all that noise!

54:10.966 --> 54:13.886
Tell her to stop punching me!
Besides, what are you doing...

54:14.011 --> 54:16.013
letting that female
in your apartment?

54:16.138 --> 54:19.266
I've been waiting a long time
to get Brace Channing into my apartment.

54:19.392 --> 54:22.227
But you like Lizzie! I could tell
through your saliva exchange.

54:22.353 --> 54:25.064
-Excuse me?
-Look, Tim, the other night,

54:25.189 --> 54:27.191
when you were unconscious,
Lizzie came here.

54:27.316 --> 54:29.902
-And you what, you kissed her?
-Yes-- No, no--

54:30.027 --> 54:32.196
Well, you did.

54:32.321 --> 54:34.281
I did a molecular
identiclone of your body.

54:34.406 --> 54:36.909
-What? You what?
-You'd never understand.

54:37.034 --> 54:38.953
You people think E-mail is amazing.

54:39.078 --> 54:41.747
The point is, while I was you,

54:41.872 --> 54:44.750
I tapped into your subconscious,
and trust me, you like Lizzie.

54:44.875 --> 54:47.586
That's why I thought it was okay
for you to kiss her.

54:47.711 --> 54:49.964
I-I-I didn't kiss her, you did!

54:57.429 --> 55:00.641
[Gasps]
Bingo!

55:00.766 --> 55:05.896
Tim? I let myself
in the back door.

55:06.021 --> 55:08.774
Hello?

55:08.899 --> 55:13.112
-Oh, isn't this nice?
-Lizzie, is that you?

55:13.237 --> 55:16.824
Oh, you look, um, nice.

55:16.949 --> 55:19.285
He's in the bathroom,

55:19.410 --> 55:21.787
and he's all yours.

55:21.912 --> 55:24.081
I got what I came for.

55:28.294 --> 55:31.464
-Oh, this is great.
-Tim!

55:31.589 --> 55:34.758
-We don't have a lot of time here!
-I'm confused, all right?

55:34.883 --> 55:37.636
-Everything was going along fine
until you came along.

55:37.761 --> 55:40.639
Even a substandard species
such as yours has feelings.

55:40.764 --> 55:44.810
Just slow down for one millisecond
and look into your heart.

55:44.935 --> 55:47.313
Whose face do you see?

55:54.278 --> 55:57.031
Look, Brace, I think--
Lizzie!

55:58.282 --> 56:01.327
Whoa!
Lizzie, no, wait, wait--

56:01.452 --> 56:04.622
-No, please!
-This better be good.

56:04.830 --> 56:06.457
Oh, it is. It is.

56:06.582 --> 56:09.376
Uh, remember that guy
I was with at the pier yesterday?

56:09.502 --> 56:12.588
-Your Uncle Martin.
-He's not my uncle.

56:12.713 --> 56:14.715
He's a Martian!

56:14.840 --> 56:16.634
-[Chuckles]
-Yeah.

56:16.759 --> 56:20.387
-You are such a jerk!
-No, no, no. He's a Martian!

56:20.513 --> 56:23.557
It's the truth. In fact,
he's the one who kissed you, not me.

56:23.682 --> 56:25.434
-Really?
-Yeah.

56:25.559 --> 56:27.978
His head's in my sink right now.

56:28.103 --> 56:30.940
-[Grunts]
-Get some sleep. You look awful.

56:31.065 --> 56:34.235
-Lizzie--
-And if there was anything kinky

56:34.360 --> 56:37.780
you better get Brace to give it back.

56:42.076 --> 56:46.080
[Zoot Grunts] Fine!
Since when did I become a mechanic?

56:46.205 --> 56:49.750
-[Drill Whirring]
-Do I look like overalls?

56:53.129 --> 56:55.131
Uncle Martin!

56:55.256 --> 56:58.008
-[Scissors Snipping]
-[Zoot] Okay. Don't cut the red one.

56:58.133 --> 57:00.678
-Or was it the blue one? [Mumbling]
-Ooh!

57:00.803 --> 57:03.848
I can't see a thing down here!

57:03.973 --> 57:05.975
Oh, thanks.

57:09.103 --> 57:11.313
-[Electricity Zapping]
-Ow! Geez, that hurt!

57:11.438 --> 57:13.524
-[Screams]
-No!

57:13.649 --> 57:16.152
Lady, please!
Put a sock in it! Quiet!

57:16.277 --> 57:18.195
The baby's sleeping!

57:18.320 --> 57:20.656
Martin, I told you.
We gotta get to the...

57:20.781 --> 57:22.783
TV station before Brace does.

57:22.908 --> 57:25.119
-[Martin] Open the bag!
-Okay, okay.

57:25.244 --> 57:27.496
-[Gasping] I can't breathe!
-I'm sorry.

57:27.621 --> 57:30.374
-Where is that confounded Zoot?
-Zoot? Uh--

57:30.499 --> 57:34.170
Zoot! Zoot! I think he's
in the middle of a spin cycle.

57:34.295 --> 57:38.049
Leave him! Quick, Tim!
Get my arm out of the other bag!

57:38.174 --> 57:40.676
-All right. Okay, okay, okay.
-Okay.

57:40.801 --> 57:44.180
-Okay.
-Yes! Excellent! Toward the ship!

57:44.305 --> 57:46.140
-Huh? What?
-Higher! Higher! Okay, here!

57:46.265 --> 57:49.060
Here we go!
[Grunts] Yes!

57:49.185 --> 57:51.729
-[Whimpering]
-[Martin] Easy. Oh, no!

57:51.854 --> 57:55.483
-[Screaming]
-Oh, no! Don't send me

57:55.608 --> 57:57.359
-[Whimpering]
-Ohh!

57:57.485 --> 58:00.321
-What was that?
-Uh-oh.

58:02.448 --> 58:04.408
Sweetie-pie,

58:04.533 --> 58:06.535
this is the most amazing footage
I've ever seen.

58:06.660 --> 58:08.996
Felix!
O'Hara's tapes are going on the 6:00.

58:09.121 --> 58:11.206
-Van Gundy, call the network.
-Yeah?

58:11.332 --> 58:14.043
Brace is going out live
with the story of the century!

58:16.796 --> 58:18.756
[Martin]
I'm feeling a little carsick!

58:18.881 --> 58:20.883
-Oh!
-Sorry.

58:21.008 --> 58:23.552
[Martin Grunting]

58:23.677 --> 58:27.223
I can't take it any more.
I can't take it any more!

58:27.348 --> 58:31.352
-We're running out of time.
Try and pull yourself together.

58:31.477 --> 58:34.939
Without my blasted electron accelerator,
the I.S.S. will blow!

58:35.064 --> 58:37.233
I feel like a hacksaw murderer.

58:37.358 --> 58:39.777
What the heck is
an electron accelerator anyway?

58:39.902 --> 58:42.905
It's a simple low-amperage power source
that activates the main thrusters.

58:43.030 --> 58:46.784
-Oh. Kind of like an alternator?
-What's an alternator?

58:46.909 --> 58:49.912
-It, uh, turns over the engine in a car.
-[Gasps] A car?

58:50.037 --> 58:52.623
That's it! That should work!
We're saved!

58:52.748 --> 58:54.750
-Not quite.
-Yes, we are.

58:54.875 --> 58:57.503
-Whoo-hoo! Ha, ha, ha.
-Listen, I've been--

58:57.628 --> 59:00.423
I've been videotaping you.
I've got everything. I got the ship.

59:00.548 --> 59:03.676
I got Zoot.
I even got you in your Martian form.

59:03.801 --> 59:06.470
I was putting together a story,
and I was gonna get it on the air,

59:06.595 --> 59:08.639
-but I couldn't do it.
-Why not?

59:08.764 --> 59:10.433
Because I like you, Martin.

59:10.558 --> 59:12.643
I like you. I--

59:12.768 --> 59:14.687
And I'm sorry.
I-I just-- I'm sorry.

59:14.812 --> 59:18.190
I I-- I apologize.
I shouldn't have lied to you.

59:18.315 --> 59:21.110
-You're a good human, Tim O'Hara.
-Oh, oh, yeah. I'm a terrific--

59:21.235 --> 59:23.279
Martin!
You're back!

59:23.404 --> 59:25.531
And I like you too.

59:25.656 --> 59:28.284
-Oh-ho!
-I've never had feelings before!

59:28.409 --> 59:30.286
-Oh.
-[Chuckles]

59:30.411 --> 59:33.372
Now, let's go fix my ship.

59:33.497 --> 59:35.541
Yeah, okay-- No!
No, we got a problem-- the tapes.

59:35.666 --> 59:39.128
-Brace goes on with the
Martian story in five minutes.

59:39.253 --> 59:42.965
Yeah, and I got to get these tapes and
get to Brace before she gets on the air.

59:43.090 --> 59:45.634
But there's not enough time.
You can't be in two places at once.

59:45.759 --> 59:49.138
Yeah. Wait a minute!
Come on!

59:49.263 --> 59:51.682
Is there an alien amongst us?

59:51.807 --> 59:55.644
Is there an alien amongst us?

59:55.769 --> 59:58.147
-Is there an alien among--
-[Knocking]

59:58.272 --> 01:00:01.817
Billy, now what?

01:00:01.942 --> 01:00:04.570
I want to be Brace Channing.

01:00:04.695 --> 01:00:07.072
Yeah, well, get in line.
I'm sorry.

01:00:07.197 --> 01:00:08.699
I really don't have time
to do any auto--

01:00:10.451 --> 01:00:13.579
-[Gasps]
-Quaint, aren't they?

01:00:13.704 --> 01:00:16.332
These days, most of our young
are born cable-ready.

01:00:16.457 --> 01:00:18.334
You're the--
[Gasps]

01:00:18.459 --> 01:00:21.587
[Gasps] Daddy!
[Screams]

01:00:23.130 --> 01:00:25.007
[Director]
Heads up. Four minutes to air.

01:00:25.132 --> 01:00:28.344
First positions, everyone.

01:00:28.469 --> 01:00:32.264
Tim! What are you doing here?
You look, uh, tired.

01:00:32.389 --> 01:00:35.518
Oh, yeah. I was up all night with Brace
working on the alien story.

01:00:35.643 --> 01:00:39.063
I made a couple of mistakes
in tape number two,

01:00:39.188 --> 01:00:43.859
Now if I could just get through this
without having to look in a mirror.

01:00:43.984 --> 01:00:47.446
-Hmm.
-[Director]

01:00:50.407 --> 01:00:52.409
[Grunts]

01:00:59.041 --> 01:01:01.085
Tim!

01:01:01.210 --> 01:01:04.380
-Martin, is that you?
-Does a wild bear blotz in the woods?

01:01:04.505 --> 01:01:08.300
Good, good. Okay. Just--
Just read the copy as written. Go.

01:01:10.344 --> 01:01:12.263
-Hi, Brace.
-[Chuckling Nervously]

01:01:12.388 --> 01:01:15.391
-Congratulations, Brace.
-Yes, I'm Brace Channing.

01:01:15.516 --> 01:01:17.977
[Man]
Let's hear it for Brace!

01:01:18.102 --> 01:01:21.564
[Whistling, Applauding]

01:01:21.689 --> 01:01:25.568
-Dr Coleye, you're going
to become a very famous man.

01:01:25.693 --> 01:01:27.737
-[Announcer] KGSC.
-Ready camera one live.

01:01:27.862 --> 01:01:29.947
-The news for southern California...
-[Grunting]

01:01:30.072 --> 01:01:34.827
with anchor Howard Greenly and
on special assignment, Brace Channing.

01:01:34.952 --> 01:01:37.329
-What the hell is she wearing?
-You know Brace.

01:01:37.455 --> 01:01:41.417
-Yeah. Must be trendy.
-[Director] Fifteen seconds, people.

01:01:41.542 --> 01:01:46.422
[Mr. Channing]
Sweetie-pie, get rid of the gum.

01:01:46.547 --> 01:01:49.675
-Billy!
-Come on, Brace!

01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:53.262
-Get the gum, Billy!
-[Man] Brace, ten seconds.

01:01:53.387 --> 01:01:55.431
Ready?
Camera two live in five--

01:01:55.556 --> 01:01:57.099
-Give me the gum, Brace!
-No! No! No!

01:01:57.224 --> 01:01:59.435
-Four--
-No!

01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:02.104
-Three--
-Get the damn gum!

01:02:02.229 --> 01:02:05.483
-[Roars]
-[Announcer]

01:02:05.608 --> 01:02:07.985
This report is being broadcast live.

01:02:08.110 --> 01:02:10.779
-The gum is out.
-Oh, good. Thanks to you, Felix.

01:02:10.905 --> 01:02:14.700
[Announcer]
And now, Howard Greenly...

01:02:14.825 --> 01:02:17.036
-And cue Howard.
-and Brace Channing!

01:02:17.161 --> 01:02:19.455
-Good evening. I'm Howard Greenly.
-[Groaning]

01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:22.166
-What's up with her?
-I don't know.

01:02:22.291 --> 01:02:27.546
...a story developing throughout the day
right here in southern California.

01:02:27.671 --> 01:02:32.301
Our own Brace Channing has been
following the events as they take place.

01:02:32.426 --> 01:02:34.720
-Brace?
-[Groans]

01:02:34.845 --> 01:02:37.223
-What is she doing?
-Howard--

01:02:37.348 --> 01:02:39.350
-Camera two go.
-No!

01:02:39.475 --> 01:02:42.061
[Greenly]
Brace?

01:02:42.186 --> 01:02:44.313
-Brace!
-Just read the copy!

01:02:44.438 --> 01:02:47.316
[Groans]
Just get the nurplex.

01:02:47.441 --> 01:02:49.693
What's going on here?

01:02:49.819 --> 01:02:51.820
Is there an alien amongst us?

01:02:51.946 --> 01:02:54.823
-Oh. It's all right.
-According to Dr Elliot Coleye,

01:02:54.949 --> 01:02:58.327
chief biologist and head researcher
for the SETI group,

01:02:58.452 --> 01:03:00.746
the answer is--

01:03:00.871 --> 01:03:03.582
-[Gasping]
-Yes.

01:03:03.707 --> 01:03:07.169
-She's an alien!
-She's not an alien. She's my daughter!

01:03:07.294 --> 01:03:09.588
[Voice Tonality Wavering] What you're
about to see is that evidence...

01:03:09.713 --> 01:03:12.341
[Squawks]
of the actual footage of the alien.

01:03:12.466 --> 01:03:15.010
But I warn you--
it's appearance is unlike...

01:03:15.135 --> 01:03:17.680
[Gasps] anything you are
likely to have seen before.

01:03:17.805 --> 01:03:20.933
She's going under the table.
She's going under the table!

01:03:21.058 --> 01:03:23.852
-[Continues, Voice Wavering]
-And go.

01:03:23.978 --> 01:03:27.189
-Feelin' hot, hot, hot
-What the hell is this?

01:03:27.314 --> 01:03:30.693
-Somebody mislabelled the tapes!
-Come on. Got it!

01:03:30.818 --> 01:03:33.237
-I don't know. Let's go back live.
-Tim!

01:03:33.362 --> 01:03:35.698
What is O'Hara doing with my daughter?

01:03:35.823 --> 01:03:38.617
-I-I-I don't know. I--
-Get me out of here!

01:03:38.742 --> 01:03:41.120
-[Chattering]
-[Muffled Screaming]

01:03:41.245 --> 01:03:44.039
-[Shouting]
-Get me the network!

01:03:44.164 --> 01:03:46.542
-You're a dead man, O'Hara!
-Come on!

01:03:46.667 --> 01:03:50.212
I think that went pretty well,
don't you?

01:03:50.337 --> 01:03:52.923
-[Muffled Shouting]
-[Martin] All right. Calm down.

01:03:53.049 --> 01:03:55.467
Search everywhere!

01:03:55.593 --> 01:03:58.596
Boy, her head was dark and empty.

01:03:58.721 --> 01:04:01.098
-There they are! There they are!
-[Muffled Shouting]

01:04:01.223 --> 01:04:03.309
Wait!

01:04:05.352 --> 01:04:08.230
I think Miss Channing might have been
contaminated by the alien.

01:04:08.355 --> 01:04:11.275
-Hmm?
-I'm just going to give her

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:13.569
[Muffled Shout]
No!

01:04:13.694 --> 01:04:15.779
I'll just be a moment.

01:04:15.946 --> 01:04:17.907
Ah.
There we go.

01:04:18.032 --> 01:04:20.075
Let's see.
Am I forgetting something?

01:04:20.201 --> 01:04:23.079
Oh.
[Humming]

01:04:23.204 --> 01:04:25.915
There it is.

01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:28.000
[Humming Resumes]

01:04:28.125 --> 01:04:30.085
-Mrs. Brown! Down here!
-[Martin] Lady, please.

01:04:30.211 --> 01:04:33.631
-[Both Shouting]
-Oh, this is darling.

01:04:33.756 --> 01:04:36.091
-I'm gonna hurl!
-[Shouting]

01:04:36.216 --> 01:04:39.637
This will make some child very happy...
if he's got a buck or two.

01:04:45.601 --> 01:04:48.687
-Hey, Mrs. B. How are you?
-Hello, fellows.

01:04:50.564 --> 01:04:53.859
Zoot!
Blotz!

01:04:53.984 --> 01:04:56.112
My ship! Where's my ship?

01:04:56.237 --> 01:04:58.781
-We only have two hours
before it explodes!

01:04:58.906 --> 01:05:00.866
Hurry!
Zoot!

01:05:02.076 --> 01:05:04.120
Zoot?
Where are you?

01:05:04.245 --> 01:05:07.373
Blotz! You're not Zoot.
Where could he be?

01:05:07.498 --> 01:05:10.292
I'm not leaving this planet
without Zoot. Tim!

01:05:10.417 --> 01:05:12.962
Not upstairs.

01:05:13.087 --> 01:05:15.798
-What's a "rummaggie" sale?
-"Rummaggie" sale?

01:05:15.923 --> 01:05:19.218
R-- Rummaggie--
Rummage. Mrs. Brown.

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:26.475
-[Tyres Squealing]
-[Siren Wailing]

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:28.811
-Looks like we got company.
-Blotz!

01:05:28.936 --> 01:05:32.314
It's them!
After them!

01:05:32.439 --> 01:05:37.987
-[Sirens Wailing]
-Hang on.

01:05:38.112 --> 01:05:40.239
-Ooh.
-I repeat, Gilford and Third.

01:05:40.364 --> 01:05:44.493
Give me that thing.
I want a roadblock!

01:05:44.618 --> 01:05:48.831
-We're never gonna lose 'em!
-Can't you drive any faster,

01:05:53.335 --> 01:05:55.421
-Uh-oh, we're in trouble.
-[Martin] Maximum thrust!

01:05:55.546 --> 01:05:57.882
-What?
-Stand on it, Stan!

01:05:59.383 --> 01:06:01.677
-We're gonna crash!
-[Triggers Cocking]

01:06:01.802 --> 01:06:04.180
-I think not!
-[Device Beeps]

01:06:04.305 --> 01:06:08.059
[Tyres Squealing]

01:06:08.184 --> 01:06:10.227
-[Tyres Squealing]
-Aah!

01:06:11.478 --> 01:06:13.898
-Oh!
-Shoot it! Come on!

01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:18.402
-They're shooting at us!
-Duck in that garage.

01:06:18.527 --> 01:06:20.946
-What garage?
-There!

01:06:22.364 --> 01:06:24.742
[Both Screaming]

01:06:24.867 --> 01:06:27.953
Oh. Tim, why are we stopping?

01:06:29.830 --> 01:06:32.875
-[Car Ignition Grinding]
-They're right there.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.629
God!

01:06:36.754 --> 01:06:40.049
-Get me that thing over there!
We're gonna flush 'em out!

01:06:40.174 --> 01:06:42.551
-I dropped it!
-What? Dropped what?

01:06:42.676 --> 01:06:45.304
-My molecular compressor!
-Here.

01:06:45.429 --> 01:06:47.556
Use this.

01:06:47.681 --> 01:06:51.560
-This won't work!
-No, use it to find it.

01:06:53.229 --> 01:06:56.398
That'll do very nicely.
Now, get it in there!

01:06:56.524 --> 01:06:58.484
Uh! Uh!
Nuts!

01:06:58.609 --> 01:07:00.569
Ahh! I found it!

01:07:00.694 --> 01:07:02.821
[Coleye]
We've got you now!

01:07:04.073 --> 01:07:06.158
-Tim!
-I see it!

01:07:08.869 --> 01:07:11.455
-[Martin Groans]
-[Tim] Sorry.

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:16.502
[Shouting]

01:07:21.215 --> 01:07:24.760
-Faster. Faster.
-It's getting closer!

01:07:24.885 --> 01:07:28.430
-I'm going as fast as I can!
-That's not fast enough!

01:07:28.556 --> 01:07:31.642
[Screaming]

01:07:38.149 --> 01:07:41.861
Martin! Martin, up ahead!
We're trapped! Quick, make us smaller.

01:07:46.323 --> 01:07:49.201
We're not gonna make it!

01:07:49.326 --> 01:07:52.037
Hang on!

01:07:55.332 --> 01:07:59.628
-Are we clear?
-[Martin] Whoa-ho, I think we did it!

01:07:59.753 --> 01:08:02.465
-I see light ahead!
-Oh. Whoa, whoa-ooh!

01:08:02.590 --> 01:08:05.342
[Both Screaming]

01:08:15.936 --> 01:08:20.149
-Where the heck are we?
-[Man] Hey, Elma,

01:08:20.274 --> 01:08:23.319
[Woman] It's in the bathroom,
right where you left it.

01:08:23.444 --> 01:08:25.863
Oh, yeah.
I see it now.

01:08:25.988 --> 01:08:28.823
By the way,
where's my tuna sandwich?

01:08:28.948 --> 01:08:32.161
-You want it in there?
-Ha-ha. Ohh!

01:08:32.286 --> 01:08:35.581
Why'd I eat that fourth burrito?
[Grunting]

01:08:35.706 --> 01:08:38.709
-Uh-oh.
-[Grunting Continues]

01:08:42.129 --> 01:08:45.006
[Flatulent Sounds]

01:08:46.508 --> 01:08:50.261
-Do it. Do it now.
-[Device Beeping]

01:08:50.386 --> 01:08:52.890
Uh! Uh, uh, uh--
[Screaming]

01:09:02.733 --> 01:09:05.027
-Sorry, buddy.
-I'll get you, you son of a b--

01:09:05.152 --> 01:09:08.906
-No!
-Sir, the police just had a crank call.

01:09:09.031 --> 01:09:11.951
-A '62 Plymouth just came out
of a toilet on Woodlawn.

01:09:15.703 --> 01:09:17.706
[Martin]
Stop! Pull over! Pull over!

01:09:17.832 --> 01:09:19.792
We need to talk!
Pull over!

01:09:19.917 --> 01:09:22.044
[Brakes Squealing]

01:09:22.169 --> 01:09:24.087
-Pull over there.
-Where? Oh.

01:09:24.212 --> 01:09:26.924
-Get the alternator. I'll get the ship!
-Okay.

01:09:27.049 --> 01:09:31.303
Oh, my goodness! Martin!
What's wrong?

01:09:31.428 --> 01:09:33.389
Forgive me, Lorelei,
but this is urgent.

01:09:33.514 --> 01:09:35.890
-You have something I need desperately.
-Oh, wow.

01:09:36.015 --> 01:09:39.395
-Martin, don't say that
unless you mean it.

01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:44.567
-I'm from another world.
-Oh, well, I could have told you that.

01:09:50.738 --> 01:09:53.783
-[Grunts]
-Oh! Mmm!

01:09:53.908 --> 01:09:56.662
Mar-- Martin?

01:09:56.787 --> 01:09:59.081
Martin, come on!

01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:03.794
When you look at the stars,
think of me.

01:10:03.919 --> 01:10:06.589
-Oh. [Giggles]
-[Barks]

01:10:06.714 --> 01:10:10.968
[Gasps]
Oh! Whew!

01:10:11.093 --> 01:10:13.595
Feelings for an Earth woman--
I've gotta get off this planet.

01:10:13.721 --> 01:10:15.681
I've got it!

01:10:15.806 --> 01:10:18.184
I don't have the right tools,
so I'm having trouble getting--

01:10:18.309 --> 01:10:21.937
Oh!
Or we could do it your way.

01:10:22.062 --> 01:10:25.441
But wait! This means your vehicle
will cease to function.

01:10:25.566 --> 01:10:28.152
I know how much it means to you.

01:10:28.277 --> 01:10:31.613
Well, that's too bad.
Just had the darn thing washed too.

01:10:38.746 --> 01:10:40.998
That's good!
That's--

01:10:41.123 --> 01:10:43.125
Martin? Martin?

01:10:45.628 --> 01:10:48.381
-[Coleye] Direct hit!
-Uncle Martin?

01:11:00.643 --> 01:11:03.813
[Tim]
Hey! Hey, what--

01:11:03.938 --> 01:11:07.483
Hey, you don't know what you're doing!
Hey, hey!

01:11:07.608 --> 01:11:12.237
Don't mess with that spaceship!
It's gonna explode!

01:11:12.362 --> 01:11:14.406
-Narrow the beam.
-Intensify.

01:11:14.531 --> 01:11:17.326
[Lizzie Groaning]

01:11:17.451 --> 01:11:19.995
I'm not flame-retardant!

01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:23.165
We're in here!
Stop it!

01:11:23.290 --> 01:11:25.209
-[Sobbing]
-We're gonna die.

01:11:25.334 --> 01:11:29.338
-Die? And I'm still virgin wool!
-It's okay.

01:11:29.463 --> 01:11:32.008
I'm scared! Hold me!
[Sobbing]

01:11:32.133 --> 01:11:34.051
Oh, this is nice.

01:11:34.176 --> 01:11:36.387
[Beeping]

01:11:39.181 --> 01:11:43.686
[Coleye]
Easy does it.

01:11:43.811 --> 01:11:46.689
Great.

01:11:46.814 --> 01:11:51.027
-Wow. Fascinating.
-[Woman] Doctor.

01:11:51.152 --> 01:11:53.529
It appears to be some sort of...

01:11:53.654 --> 01:11:56.198
biomechanical transmitting device.

01:11:56.323 --> 01:11:58.575
Doctor, there's some chewing gum
wedged back in his molar.

01:11:58.701 --> 01:12:01.370
Leave it!
Pestering me with Juicy Fruit!

01:12:01.495 --> 01:12:05.040
This guy's got a radio station
inside of his skull! Here.

01:12:05.166 --> 01:12:08.711
We'll put this under the electron
microscope later. Whoa-ho!

01:12:08.836 --> 01:12:12.423
Excellent.
Armitan's gonna be eating his words!

01:12:12.548 --> 01:12:16.051
Perfect ending
to an already perfect day.

01:12:16.176 --> 01:12:20.055
-He's a little pale.
-I think he's having a negative

01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:22.433
Well, two CCs of adrenaline, stat!

01:12:22.558 --> 01:12:25.436
-Doctor, I think we're losing him.
-[Yelling, Pounding]

01:12:25.561 --> 01:12:28.105
-Nothing.
-[Man] Shut it down.

01:12:28.230 --> 01:12:31.942
-Get ready to try it again.
This time, full power.

01:12:33.736 --> 01:12:36.071
-He's pointing to the thing.
-Pick it up. Pick--

01:12:36.196 --> 01:12:38.282
Pick it-- Yeah.
No. No, no, no.

01:12:38.407 --> 01:12:40.743
No, that one. That one.

01:12:40.868 --> 01:12:43.787
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

01:12:43.913 --> 01:12:46.832
This. Do this.

01:12:46.957 --> 01:12:51.295
-[Beeping]
-Yes!

01:12:53.422 --> 01:12:56.258
[Shouting]

01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:02.139
Whoa-oh-oh!

01:13:05.392 --> 01:13:07.645
No. No, no. Oh.

01:13:07.770 --> 01:13:09.939
-Tim!
-Oh!

01:13:10.064 --> 01:13:12.441
All right, back off, Gomer.
Hey.

01:13:12.566 --> 01:13:14.443
Give me that, dipstick!

01:13:14.568 --> 01:13:16.529
You get Tim.
I'll scare the locals.

01:13:16.654 --> 01:13:18.781
[Shouts]

01:13:18.906 --> 01:13:20.699
-Let's get out of here!
-Call security!

01:13:20.824 --> 01:13:23.202
-[All Shouting]
-Nobody will take on the suit!

01:13:23.327 --> 01:13:25.788
My zipper is stuck,
and I'm mad as hell!

01:13:25.913 --> 01:13:28.624
-Lizzie, what--
-Tim! Oh, are you okay?

01:13:28.749 --> 01:13:31.043
-Fine, fine. Are you okay?
-Oh, you wouldn't believe--

01:13:31.168 --> 01:13:35.131
-Yeah.
-[Beeping]

01:13:35.256 --> 01:13:38.384
-We got to find Martin.
-Yeah.

01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:41.387
Back off!
You heard me.

01:13:41.512 --> 01:13:43.973
You don't understand. That spaceship's
gonna explode in 20 minutes.

01:13:44.098 --> 01:13:46.725
-It is?
-On the floor. Now.

01:13:48.269 --> 01:13:50.479
Excuse me.
Arnold, Jean-Claude?

01:13:50.604 --> 01:13:54.066
[Shouts]
Not working. Oh.

01:13:54.191 --> 01:13:56.819
-It's an empty suit.
-Empty suit?

01:13:56.944 --> 01:14:00.030
Now you've done it, Grasshopper.
Whoo-aah!

01:14:02.950 --> 01:14:05.661
Boxing?
[Chuckles]

01:14:05.786 --> 01:14:07.830
-You should be boxing groceries.
-[Grunts]

01:14:07.955 --> 01:14:10.374
[Laughs]
That tickles, ya big ox!

01:14:10.499 --> 01:14:13.502
Say, aren't you
one of the Spice Girls?

01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:18.049
[Crashes]

01:14:18.174 --> 01:14:20.175
Beavis down, Butt-head to go.

01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:23.679
So, is it true you peed your bunk
in summer camp? Ouch!

01:14:23.804 --> 01:14:26.265
-[Screams]
-[Gasping]

01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:30.227
Oh, Gee-- Tim! Lizzie!

-[Grunts]

01:14:39.654 --> 01:14:42.072

[Groaning Continues]

01:14:57.004 --> 01:14:59.382
-Uh-oh.
-[Grunts]

01:14:59.507 --> 01:15:01.592
-This is gonna hurt.
-Ooh!

01:15:01.717 --> 01:15:04.470
-Ow!
-[Lizzie Gasps]

01:15:04.595 --> 01:15:07.598
-[Blows Landing, Both Grunting]
-Lizzie!

01:15:07.723 --> 01:15:09.558
The ship's going to explode!

01:15:09.683 --> 01:15:12.228
Veenox Seven.
Chew this.

01:15:12.353 --> 01:15:15.398
-[Punching Continues]
-[Tim] You gotta believe it!

01:15:25.866 --> 01:15:28.577
Whoa-oh-oh-oh!

01:15:28.702 --> 01:15:31.121

-[Screams]

01:16:01.235 --> 01:16:03.612
[Belches]
Uh-oh.

01:16:03.737 --> 01:16:06.323
Did you do something with your hair?

01:16:06.448 --> 01:16:10.286
Glad you noticed.
[Roars]

01:16:17.585 --> 01:16:20.046
[Mutters]
Whoop!

01:16:20.171 --> 01:16:22.173
[Sighs]

01:16:25.426 --> 01:16:28.470
-I think I liked you
better the other way.

01:16:28.595 --> 01:16:31.849
-[In Raspy Voice]
Well, that can be arranged.

01:16:31.974 --> 01:16:35.978
-Where's Zoot?
-[Moaning]

01:16:36.103 --> 01:16:38.731
Oh, no.

01:16:40.107 --> 01:16:42.568
Come on!
Come on!

01:16:42.693 --> 01:16:45.362
Doctor, he's gone.

01:16:45.487 --> 01:16:48.657
He's not gone till I say he's gone,
so back off!

01:16:48.782 --> 01:16:51.368
-Back off! Now!
-[Nurse] Charge the paddle.

01:16:51.493 --> 01:16:54.580
-[Man] All right, we're charged.
-[Coleye] Clear! Clear!

01:16:54.705 --> 01:16:57.833
All right. Clear!

01:16:57.958 --> 01:17:01.212
-Come on, Martin.
-[Electricity Buzzing]

01:17:01.337 --> 01:17:03.422
-Oh, damn!
-There's no pulse, Doctor.

01:17:03.547 --> 01:17:07.718
All right, all right.
I'm calling it. 8:15.

01:17:07.843 --> 01:17:12.014
-We're too late.
-[Zoot] No, hurry!

01:17:12.139 --> 01:17:15.518
-[Man] Would you like me
to do the autopsy, Doctor?

01:17:15.643 --> 01:17:18.062
-You get out of here! Get out!
-All right. All right.

01:17:18.187 --> 01:17:20.689
All of you idiots, you get out.
You get out.

01:17:20.815 --> 01:17:23.442
-I'm goin'!
-You get right out. Clowns!

01:17:23.609 --> 01:17:25.569
Come on.

01:17:25.695 --> 01:17:30.699
Okay, my sorry little Martian.

01:17:30.824 --> 01:17:33.869
Have it your way.

01:17:33.994 --> 01:17:36.705
Let's open you up.

01:17:36.831 --> 01:17:41.127
-[Lizzie] Assistance, Doctor?
-What? No! You--

01:17:41.252 --> 01:17:43.713
Hey, wait a minute.
You're not--

01:17:43.838 --> 01:17:46.382
-She came with me.
-Oh.

01:17:46.507 --> 01:17:49.093
[Electricity Zapping]

01:17:49.218 --> 01:17:51.887
[Moans]

01:17:56.559 --> 01:17:59.478
[Zoot's Voice]
Must... be together.

01:18:19.457 --> 01:18:21.167
Zoot!

01:18:33.595 --> 01:18:36.015
-[Gasps]
-Martin?

01:18:38.893 --> 01:18:42.521
-Martin!
-[Groans] Tim! Lizzie!

01:18:42.646 --> 01:18:45.441
-You're-- You're--
-[Zoot] Breathin', baby!

01:18:45.566 --> 01:18:48.277
Oh, you beauteous bathrobe!
[Laughs]

01:18:48.402 --> 01:18:50.446
-Martin--
-Let's see cotton do that, huh? Easy.

01:18:50.571 --> 01:18:53.449
-I got an image!
-[Martin] Okay, okay.

01:18:53.574 --> 01:18:55.534
Martin! Martin!

01:18:55.659 --> 01:18:58.662
-We don't have much time.
-Blotz!

01:18:58.787 --> 01:19:01.457
-[Man, Over Loudspeaker]
Shut down and monitor all exits.

01:19:01.582 --> 01:19:03.793
[Men Chattering, Indistinct]

01:19:03.918 --> 01:19:06.712
[Woman, Over Loudspeaker]
All units stand by for total lockup.

01:19:08.589 --> 01:19:10.716
-Martin, can you get the lock?
-I think so.

01:19:12.259 --> 01:19:14.553
-[Electricity Humming]
-Come on!

01:19:16.597 --> 01:19:19.475
-[Man, Over Loudspeaker]
Biotech units on alert.

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:22.478
[Woman, Over Loudspeaker]
All non-security personnel...

01:19:22.603 --> 01:19:25.523
-are to report to their holding areas.
-Come on. Stay down!

01:19:25.648 --> 01:19:29.318
-Stay down.
-Here's a place!

01:19:29.443 --> 01:19:31.570
All right.
Stand back, you two.

01:19:31.695 --> 01:19:33.697
[Device Beeping]

01:19:41.455 --> 01:19:44.333
-[Siren Wailing]
-What's going on? Where's the alien?

01:19:44.458 --> 01:19:47.503
-There's been a slight problem.
-Open that gate. Let's find Dr Coleye.

01:19:47.628 --> 01:19:49.422
-Yes, sir, yes, sir. Right away.
-Come on!

01:19:49.547 --> 01:19:51.382
Let 'em through!

01:19:52.716 --> 01:19:54.760
Here.

01:19:57.471 --> 01:20:00.266
There. [Grunts]
Contact.

01:20:00.391 --> 01:20:03.102
There.
I think that's going to work.

01:20:04.854 --> 01:20:06.856
I'm gonna miss you, Martin.

01:20:06.981 --> 01:20:11.027
-[Zoot Giggles]
-You too, Zoot.

01:20:11.152 --> 01:20:13.737
Hey, let 'em know how you feel!
[Chuckles]

01:20:13.862 --> 01:20:15.864
You're the best pet I ever had!

01:20:15.990 --> 01:20:18.200
Stop being such a baby blanket!

01:20:18.325 --> 01:20:21.120
[Mutters]

01:20:21.245 --> 01:20:23.747
Lizzie, my dear friend.

01:20:24.874 --> 01:20:27.918
Take care, Uncle Martin.

01:20:30.338 --> 01:20:34.758
I've done that before. It's very nice.
I highly recommend it.

01:20:37.344 --> 01:20:40.598
Good luck, you two.

01:20:45.019 --> 01:20:48.064
Something tells me
you're gonna miss your flight!

01:20:48.189 --> 01:20:51.275
-Then in two minutes, we all die.
-You're lying.

01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:55.112
Are you certain about that, Coleye?

01:20:55.237 --> 01:20:58.157
-Because I'm not.
-What are you saying?

01:20:58.282 --> 01:21:01.452
-Release him.
-Release him?

01:21:01.577 --> 01:21:05.164
I have spent an entire career
trying to prove that aliens exist.

01:21:05.289 --> 01:21:07.166
Now he's my proof!

01:21:07.291 --> 01:21:10.753
Dead or alive,
he's staying with me!

01:21:10.878 --> 01:21:12.588
Oh. Ohh! Ohh!

01:21:12.713 --> 01:21:15.091
Whoa! Aah!

01:21:15.216 --> 01:21:18.594
-Martin?
-I don't understand! I-- I--

01:21:18.719 --> 01:21:22.306
Coleye, you always were a little blotz.

01:21:22.431 --> 01:21:25.810
-[Coleye] What?
-Neenurt!

01:21:25.935 --> 01:21:29.605
Ha ha ha! I haven't heard that name
in a long time.

01:21:29.730 --> 01:21:34.026
-Pronounced properly, anyway.
-You mean it was you all along?

01:21:34.151 --> 01:21:39.323
I can't believe this!
I should have known! You're a Martian?

01:21:39.448 --> 01:21:41.450
I was--
Uhh! Aah!

01:21:41.575 --> 01:21:44.286
[Screaming]

01:21:51.293 --> 01:21:54.839
Waaah!
[Grunting]

01:21:54.964 --> 01:21:58.717
-[Chuckling]
-Wait. You're the one I saw at the pier.

01:21:58.842 --> 01:22:00.469
I was trying to get to you
before they did.

01:22:00.594 --> 01:22:03.472
I've been trying
to hitch a ride home for 30 years!

01:22:03.597 --> 01:22:06.976
What a beauty!
Oh, by the way,

01:22:07.101 --> 01:22:09.395
I believe these belong to you.

01:22:09.520 --> 01:22:12.314
[Gasps]
My antennae.

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:15.818
I can't go home without these. I have a
hard enough time getting dates as it is.

01:22:15.943 --> 01:22:19.863
Mine's always giving me trouble too.
And everything's in black and white.

01:22:19.988 --> 01:22:23.325
-[Groaning]
-And those commercials--

01:22:23.450 --> 01:22:26.912
That gum lost its flavour in '66.

01:22:27.037 --> 01:22:29.874
All right. Let's go.
Let's go. Come on.

01:22:29.999 --> 01:22:33.085
-Got to go. Farewell.
-Come back for a visit sometime.

01:22:33.210 --> 01:22:35.838
Maybe.

01:22:35.963 --> 01:22:38.883
I'm beginning to see a glimmer
of potential among you Earthlings.

01:22:39.008 --> 01:22:42.845
One word of advice: You'll never
completely advance as a culture...

01:22:42.970 --> 01:22:46.682
until you take care of your oceans
and do away with daytime talk shows.

01:22:49.143 --> 01:22:51.353
Goodbye, you crazy lovebirds!

01:22:51.479 --> 01:22:54.231
Ah, stop being such
a hysterical housecoat.

01:22:54.357 --> 01:22:59.695
-See ya, Zoot.
-Rollin', rollin', rollin'

01:23:01.321 --> 01:23:04.742
[Growling]
Aliens!

01:23:08.204 --> 01:23:11.457
Wait! No!

01:23:11.582 --> 01:23:13.709
Please! No! You can't!

01:23:13.834 --> 01:23:16.629
Don't go! Come back!

01:23:16.754 --> 01:23:20.383
No-o-o!

01:23:20.508 --> 01:23:23.052
[Growls]

01:23:23.177 --> 01:23:24.428
Aah!

01:23:24.553 --> 01:23:26.805
What the--
Eeew!

01:23:26.931 --> 01:23:30.392
Gum. Gum!

01:23:30.518 --> 01:23:33.729
Wait, this is the alien gum!
Yes!

01:23:33.854 --> 01:23:36.065
Wait, wait.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

01:23:36.190 --> 01:23:39.318
Well, you're not me, are ya?
[Laughs]

01:23:41.195 --> 01:23:43.155
I can learn more about them...

01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:45.449
from their leftover--

01:23:45.574 --> 01:23:47.660
Wha--
That's brilliant!

01:23:47.785 --> 01:23:50.287
I can feel every molecule of my body...

01:23:50.412 --> 01:23:52.456
starting to change!

01:23:52.581 --> 01:23:55.626
[Laughing]

01:23:57.211 --> 01:23:59.171
Aah!

01:24:00.298 --> 01:24:02.633
Oh, no.

01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:09.181
Hold it! Don't move!

01:24:09.306 --> 01:24:12.601
-No!
-Stop! Don't shoot!

01:24:12.726 --> 01:24:15.146
No, not that, you idiots!

01:24:15.271 --> 01:24:18.649
-I'm not a Martian.
-We got him, boys.

01:24:18.774 --> 01:24:20.943
We've got one--
a real live Martian!

01:24:21.068 --> 01:24:25.155
It's me. Coleye. No! No!

01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:27.533
Aah!

01:24:27.658 --> 01:24:30.369
[Man]
The truth is out there!

01:24:30.494 --> 01:24:33.998
We are not leaving until they
listen to us! We've got proof!

01:24:34.123 --> 01:24:37.293
I saw one!
He cloned my body!

01:24:37.418 --> 01:24:39.295
He could be anywhere by now!

01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:41.797
The truth is out there!

01:24:41.922 --> 01:24:43.841
The truth is out there!

01:24:43.966 --> 01:24:47.302
So that's the story here
from Santa Barbara City Hall.

01:24:47.428 --> 01:24:50.472
-I'm Bill Randall, KGSC.
-[Crowd Chanting]

01:24:50.598 --> 01:24:53.225
the truth, the truth, the truth!

01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:55.394
It's all I--

01:24:59.273 --> 01:25:03.861
-Hey, sleepy. Brought you some tea.
-[Chuckles]

01:25:07.031 --> 01:25:11.493
Listen, I've been thinking. Now that
I really know what happened between us,

01:25:11.619 --> 01:25:14.830
I think maybe we should just go back
to the way things used to be.

01:25:14.955 --> 01:25:16.332
Mmm.

01:25:16.457 --> 01:25:18.501
Our friendship really does
mean a lot to me.

01:25:18.626 --> 01:25:22.088
Yeah, well, I've been thinking too,
and, uh,

01:25:22.213 --> 01:25:24.423
I think I've got enough friends.

01:25:29.970 --> 01:25:31.931
[Whooshing Sound]

01:25:48.655 --> 01:25:50.908
[Rattling]

01:25:51.033 --> 01:25:55.788
-[Hissing]
-One giant leap for man,

01:25:55.913 --> 01:25:59.208
-Zoot?
-Hey, Tim, Lizzie! We're back!

01:25:59.333 --> 01:26:03.045
-[Chuckles]
-Zoot-- [Grunts]

01:26:03.170 --> 01:26:06.299
Oh! Geez!
Call a skycap, for cryin' out loud.

01:26:06.424 --> 01:26:08.550
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

01:26:08.675 --> 01:26:11.887
We've decided to stay here with you.

01:26:12.012 --> 01:26:15.808
-Y-You what?
-I kept thinking how lonely

01:26:15.933 --> 01:26:18.060
And since you said
you were gonna miss me,

01:26:18.185 --> 01:26:21.605
I thought I'd save us both
the heartache of separation.

01:26:21.731 --> 01:26:23.774
Ya-hah! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:26:23.899 --> 01:26:28.654
B-B-B-But, Martin, I can't miss you
if you don't go!

01:26:28.779 --> 01:26:32.241
Exactly!
Isn't it wonderful?

01:26:32.366 --> 01:26:35.744
Farewell, Neenurt!

01:26:35.870 --> 01:26:38.289
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Where's he going?

01:26:38.414 --> 01:26:41.083
To Mars, of course!

01:26:41.208 --> 01:26:44.503
[Whooshing]

01:26:45.963 --> 01:26:48.799
-Whoo! [Chuckling]
-Wh--

01:26:48.925 --> 01:26:51.510
Martin. Martin.
What are you doing?

01:26:51.635 --> 01:26:55.139
Tim, since we'll be living together,
let's do something about this furniture.

01:26:55.264 --> 01:26:57.850
-Living together? What do you mean--
-I say we get rid of this couch,

01:26:57.975 --> 01:27:01.437
and buy a hyperbolic resting chamber
like normal beings have.

01:27:01.562 --> 01:27:04.190
-No! No! You're not staying here.
-Hey, who wants ice cream?

01:27:04.315 --> 01:27:07.276
-[Chuckles]
-Tonight I'm craving praline swirl.

01:27:07.401 --> 01:27:09.445
-Martin-- You think this is funny?
-[Chuckling]

01:27:09.570 --> 01:27:11.447
You haven't seen him eat ice cream.
It's not pretty!

01:27:11.572 --> 01:27:15.159
Rocky road! Rocky road! Rocky road!
[Shouts]

01:27:15.284 --> 01:27:17.369
-Martin, you can't-- He doesn't sleep.
-[Shouting Continues]

01:27:17.494 --> 01:27:19.455
He doesn't let me sleep.
This can't happen.

01:27:19.580 --> 01:27:21.791
I can't have a Martian for a roommate.

01:27:21.916 --> 01:27:24.293
I can't. I just--

01:27:24.418 --> 01:27:26.504
-Oh, maybe I can.
-[Chuckles]

01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:31.341
Zoot! We've got cookie dough.
Want some?

01:27:31.467 --> 01:27:33.719
Zoot.
Zoot, where are you?

01:27:33.844 --> 01:27:37.973
Bartender, a Mai "Tide", please.

01:27:38.098 --> 01:27:41.185
Ah, Victoria's Secret.

01:27:41.310 --> 01:27:44.647
You people know how to live!

01:27:44.772 --> 01:27:47.233
[Chuckles]
Lycra.
