00:37.439 --> 00:39.374
Hey!

00:39.407 --> 00:42.210
Hey! Ha ha ha!

00:42.244 --> 00:43.911
Yeah!

00:43.944 --> 00:45.313
Wa-hey!

00:45.347 --> 00:48.350
Yeah!

01:52.247 --> 01:54.416
We are not lost!

01:54.449 --> 01:57.017
We are somewhere around here.

01:59.154 --> 02:01.423
I told you, we're lost!

02:02.089 --> 02:03.791
We should've brought a compass.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.427
I don't need a compass!

02:08.229 --> 02:11.899
No, that's east! We've been
walking north since we set off.

02:11.932 --> 02:14.269
But... we turned west
at the river.

02:18.206 --> 02:20.074
It's that way!

02:21.343 --> 02:23.345
It's getting dark soon.

02:23.378 --> 02:25.413
You play with your GPS.

02:25.447 --> 02:27.382
I'm going this way.

02:54.008 --> 02:56.378
Akito?

02:58.280 --> 02:59.947
Akito!

03:00.881 --> 03:01.583
Akito?

03:01.616 --> 03:04.119
Akito?!

03:04.152 --> 03:05.786
Akito?!

03:37.252 --> 03:39.454
Akito?!

04:47.555 --> 04:49.557
Jen, you seen the headlamps?

04:52.993 --> 04:54.596
Hey, Jen?

04:55.363 --> 04:57.097
Hey, Jen?

04:57.132 --> 04:58.533
Y-yeah, I'm in the bathroom.

04:58.566 --> 05:01.001
You know where
the headlamps are?

05:01.034 --> 05:04.639
Oh, yeah, um... they're in
the kitchen. I'm charging them.

05:04.672 --> 05:07.375
Oh, have you seen my phone?

05:07.409 --> 05:10.978
No. Uh, but I'll have a look
when I get out.

05:11.011 --> 05:13.548
Well, better hurry.
They're here.

05:14.081 --> 05:15.717
What time do you call this?

05:17.985 --> 05:19.554
Ah, you said 10am.

05:19.587 --> 05:22.223
Yeah, on the road at 10am.
It's already 10:05.

05:22.257 --> 05:24.192
Oh. How do you live
with this guy?

05:24.225 --> 05:26.227
I just let him think
he's in charge.

05:26.261 --> 05:28.061
- Hi.
- Mwah.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.330
Oh, yours.

05:29.364 --> 05:31.064
Ah. Thanks. Where was it?

05:31.098 --> 05:32.434
It was just on the sofa inside.

05:32.467 --> 05:34.402
You two - smile.

05:34.935 --> 05:36.438
Aw!

05:36.471 --> 05:38.239
I got that torch
you told me to get.

05:38.273 --> 05:39.641
Oh, God.
Tell him about the torch.

05:39.674 --> 05:41.342
Took out a second mortgage
to get that thing.

05:41.376 --> 05:44.245
120 hours of full charge.
Worth every cent.

05:44.279 --> 05:46.947
Guys, get in. Group shot.

05:49.551 --> 05:51.586
- Alright, let's hit the road.
- Nice.

06:05.366 --> 06:07.502
So, uh,
I read your latest article.

06:07.535 --> 06:11.004
10 best bars in Bucharest.
Tough assignment.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.174
Worst hangover I ever had.

06:13.208 --> 06:14.442
You've got the cushiest job.

06:14.476 --> 06:18.112
This might be a little tricky,
though. But it'll be worth it.

06:18.146 --> 06:19.414
How'd you find out about it?

06:19.447 --> 06:21.783
Oh, my mate Cash.
He runs tours out of Cairns.

06:21.816 --> 06:23.384
Cash?

06:23.418 --> 06:25.420
You'll see.

06:25.453 --> 06:27.589
So, anyway, we're over
in Puerto Escondido.

06:27.622 --> 06:29.724
I look across
and I see this crazy bastard.

06:29.757 --> 06:31.593
He paddles into
this monster wave.

06:31.626 --> 06:33.595
This thing was huge.
It was near vertical, right?

06:33.628 --> 06:35.630
He gets completely wiped out.
Fucking boom!

06:35.663 --> 06:39.032
Like, this thing explodes
on this head, right?

06:39.066 --> 06:42.270
So I race over on the ski and I
had to haul his sorry arse out.

06:42.303 --> 06:43.705
Oh, get off!

06:43.738 --> 06:45.406
- I see what you mean.
- Mm-hm.

06:45.440 --> 06:47.609
So, this cave?

06:47.642 --> 06:48.643
Mmm.

06:48.676 --> 06:52.680
What I can tell you is
this thing is unexplored.

06:52.714 --> 06:55.183
Right? You won't find this
on any of your caving websites.

06:55.216 --> 06:59.487
Yeah, see, that part doesn't
really excite me very much.

07:00.855 --> 07:02.657
It's all good, mate.

07:06.861 --> 07:09.664
I cannot believe
I let Eric talk me into this.

07:11.266 --> 07:13.066
You say that every time.

07:15.203 --> 07:16.804
What is that, water?

07:16.838 --> 07:18.706
Not pregnant, are you?

07:23.311 --> 07:25.713
Wait. You're not?

07:25.747 --> 07:27.682
Oh, wow! Really?
That is amazing!

07:27.715 --> 07:29.584
Yes, but please
don't say anything, OK?

07:29.617 --> 07:31.119
I haven't even told Viktor.

07:31.152 --> 07:34.656
Why? He's gonna be
so excited when you tell him.

07:34.689 --> 07:35.757
Yeah.

07:35.790 --> 07:40.361
It's just... not something
we've ever spoken about.

07:40.395 --> 07:42.630
- Well, surely...
- And what about you?

07:44.899 --> 07:46.768
No, Eric would freak out.

07:49.571 --> 07:54.442
You know, things have been
kind of... bad for us. Um...

07:57.312 --> 08:00.515
Sometimes I get the feeling
he's keeping his options open.

08:02.717 --> 08:04.586
Well, remember Simmo?

08:04.619 --> 08:06.321
Remember that time
when he was like...

08:06.354 --> 08:07.589
..he's coming off
the bloody pier

08:07.622 --> 08:08.890
and he's straight into
the water?

08:08.923 --> 08:11.091
Simmo's bloody mad, that guy.

08:12.360 --> 08:14.395
You want to dance?

08:16.364 --> 08:18.499
Yeah?

08:57.271 --> 08:58.840
What?

09:00.742 --> 09:02.510
Nothing.

09:05.346 --> 09:07.448
Let's not do this.

09:07.482 --> 09:10.218
Let's just go somewhere
by ourselves, huh?

09:10.251 --> 09:11.786
Like an island.

09:11.819 --> 09:16.758
We can sit on a beach, get
massages, order room service...

09:17.659 --> 09:19.894
I thought you said
going into remission

09:19.927 --> 09:21.896
meant you want to
live life to the full.

09:23.798 --> 09:24.899
I do. It's just...

09:24.932 --> 09:27.802
I mean, don't you want to
experience something new?

09:31.406 --> 09:33.241
Eric can send me the photos

09:33.274 --> 09:36.344
and I'll make
the experience part up.

09:36.377 --> 09:39.180
I write most of my stuff
from the hotel anyway.

09:40.548 --> 09:42.950
I think it's time
you experience the real thing.

09:45.386 --> 09:46.854
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:51.559 --> 09:53.795
- Morning, Prince Charming.
- Morning.

09:55.396 --> 09:57.331
Hey, don't forget,
I found this cave.

09:57.365 --> 09:58.700
I'm going in first, alright?

09:58.733 --> 10:00.401
Thought we were gonna
toss for it.

10:00.435 --> 10:01.969
Toss this.

10:12.747 --> 10:15.483
So, how did you
find this cave?

10:15.516 --> 10:17.018
I was in
a search party last week

10:17.051 --> 10:19.587
looking for those missing
Japanese bushwalkers.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.322
I was searching
through the forest

10:21.355 --> 10:22.890
and I stumbled across
this shaft.

10:22.924 --> 10:26.394
I shine my torch in.
This thing goes way down.

10:26.427 --> 10:28.529
Any luck, she'll lead
to a bigger system

10:28.563 --> 10:31.532
and, uh... we can start
making some money.

10:31.566 --> 10:33.568
And what if it doesn't?

10:33.601 --> 10:34.836
Well, then we'll be
back in town

10:34.869 --> 10:36.504
in time for another party,
then, won't we?

10:36.537 --> 10:38.506
Eric's shout.

10:49.317 --> 10:50.785
Did you see that?

10:50.818 --> 10:52.353
Oh, yeah.

10:52.386 --> 10:53.688
Hey, are there many crocs
around here?

10:53.721 --> 10:56.657
Yeah, a few,
now that we can't cull 'em.

10:57.959 --> 10:59.060
Relax.

10:59.093 --> 11:01.963
If some nasty croc thinks
he's got an easy lunch...

11:02.597 --> 11:04.332
- Jesus!
- Whoa! What the fuck?!

11:04.365 --> 11:07.869
What? It's not loaded!
The clip's in the glove box.

11:10.538 --> 11:13.007
Did you ever find
those missing tourists?

11:14.976 --> 11:16.878
Nah, not yet.

11:37.565 --> 11:39.567
Yeah, this is it.

11:52.046 --> 11:54.549
- So, where is it?
- It's up through there.

12:08.596 --> 12:10.398
What do you reckon?

12:10.431 --> 12:13.734
Yeah, it's moving south.
We'll be fine.

12:50.538 --> 12:52.573
Welcome to Cash's Cave.

13:02.583 --> 13:04.719
Well? What do you think?

13:06.154 --> 13:07.955
Let's go find out.

13:20.235 --> 13:22.170
Looking good.

13:22.204 --> 13:24.605
You ready, big fella?

13:25.606 --> 13:26.707
Yeah, it's all good.

13:26.741 --> 13:28.476
You can go first.

13:28.509 --> 13:30.011
You've never done this before,
have you?

13:30.044 --> 13:31.213
Yes, course I have.

13:31.246 --> 13:33.115
Wrong way round, mate.

13:33.148 --> 13:34.916
Huh?

13:38.619 --> 13:40.087
- Ready?
- Mm-hm.

13:40.122 --> 13:41.555
So, when you're on,

13:41.589 --> 13:43.191
it's one hand on the brake
all the way down.

13:43.225 --> 13:44.725
Mm.

13:44.759 --> 13:46.827
- Right, be careful.
- See you at the bottom.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.864
Yeew!

14:08.183 --> 14:09.684
Ready?

14:09.717 --> 14:12.653
Ready as I'll ever be.

14:23.864 --> 14:25.533
Whew!

14:25.566 --> 14:27.202
- You right?
- Yeah, totally.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.108
Whew!

14:44.819 --> 14:46.787
That's it. Nice work,
guys. Almost there.

14:48.923 --> 14:51.193
Keep coming.

14:51.226 --> 14:52.994
Nice!

14:54.862 --> 14:56.697
Attaboy.

14:57.999 --> 14:59.734
Nice.

15:13.814 --> 15:15.683
Look. Over here.

15:21.156 --> 15:23.057
What do you reckon?

15:26.927 --> 15:29.231
Uh... what if there are
snakes in there?

15:29.264 --> 15:31.599
Eric will get bitten first,
then, won't he?

15:34.169 --> 15:35.903
Go.

15:40.775 --> 15:42.543
After you.

15:43.077 --> 15:44.678
Oh, God.

15:45.247 --> 15:47.048
Alright.

15:50.985 --> 15:52.787
Here we go.

16:40.801 --> 16:42.803
Hope no-one's claustrophobic.

16:42.837 --> 16:45.107
Probably should've asked that
before we came down here.

16:45.140 --> 16:47.342
Mmm.

16:57.285 --> 16:58.386
Oh!

16:58.420 --> 17:00.621
- You right?
- Yep.

17:07.094 --> 17:08.762
Everyone OK?

17:08.796 --> 17:10.232
Yeah.

17:10.265 --> 17:12.633
This looks promising.

17:14.768 --> 17:16.804
I wonder
how far it goes.

17:22.144 --> 17:24.212
What if we get lost down here?

17:24.246 --> 17:26.414
I mean, no-one knows
we're down here, right?

17:26.448 --> 17:27.915
I don't know.

17:27.948 --> 17:30.885
We won't get lost.
We should keep moving.

17:32.287 --> 17:34.054
Yep.

17:38.993 --> 17:41.795
Come on. I've got
a good feeling about this.

17:43.931 --> 17:45.799
Lead the way.

17:54.074 --> 17:55.743
Oi, check this out.

17:55.776 --> 17:58.812
- Oh!
- Oh, what is that?

17:58.846 --> 18:03.017
It looks like a...
a goat or something.

18:03.050 --> 18:05.287
So, we're not
the first ones down here, then.

18:05.320 --> 18:08.022
How did it get down here?

18:20.302 --> 18:22.703
Where do you reckon
that's coming from?

18:26.141 --> 18:28.075
Just seepage.

19:20.562 --> 19:23.931
Careful, guys.
Gets a bit tighter up here.

19:40.148 --> 19:42.816
Whoa. You feel that?

19:42.850 --> 19:44.286
What?

19:44.319 --> 19:46.421
Space.

19:55.330 --> 19:57.865
Careful.
It's low right here, guys.

20:02.036 --> 20:03.804
Watch your step, guys.

20:18.486 --> 20:22.390
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah!

20:31.566 --> 20:34.402
This is
what it's all about.

20:34.436 --> 20:36.870
This makes it
a cave worth exploring.

20:36.904 --> 20:40.108
Holy shit, man.
We are in business!

20:42.644 --> 20:44.412
- What did I tell you?
- Yep.

20:44.446 --> 20:46.548
Well done.

20:58.326 --> 21:01.129
- Let's check it out.
- Yeah.

21:03.164 --> 21:05.400
Let's have a look over there.

21:08.503 --> 21:10.070
You guys coming?

21:10.105 --> 21:11.939
- After you.
- Come on.

21:11.972 --> 21:13.874
Watch out for this.

21:16.411 --> 21:19.381
You good?

21:20.482 --> 21:22.317
Cold?

21:22.350 --> 21:24.152
Little bit.

21:24.185 --> 21:26.121
Nah, it's not too bad.

21:48.443 --> 21:50.111
You right?

21:50.145 --> 21:52.480
Yeah.

21:52.514 --> 21:54.482
Don't need me
to hold your hand?

22:52.340 --> 22:54.242
It's just seepage, mate.

22:54.275 --> 22:55.643
Maybe.

22:55.677 --> 22:57.445
It's running pretty fast,
though.

22:57.479 --> 23:00.582
Yeah. Probably
a natural waterway.

23:01.249 --> 23:04.419
Cave river tours.

23:05.353 --> 23:06.588
Oop.

23:06.621 --> 23:09.390
Oh, shit. Thought I checked
those batteries.

23:09.424 --> 23:11.292
What happened
to the light?

23:11.326 --> 23:12.760
Oh, shit.

23:16.664 --> 23:20.033
I don't like the look of this.
I think we should head back.

23:21.336 --> 23:22.504
Are you serious?

23:22.537 --> 23:26.441
Mate, this cave's
just getting started.

23:29.611 --> 23:32.747
A little bit of
water's not gonna hurt you.

23:34.816 --> 23:36.551
Oi!

23:38.720 --> 23:40.188
Inspired?

23:40.221 --> 23:42.089
This is incredible, huh?

24:43.351 --> 24:44.586
Hey?

24:44.619 --> 24:47.488
Hey! I think there's something
in the water.

24:48.890 --> 24:49.824
What the hell is that?

24:49.857 --> 24:52.660
I don't know.

25:12.747 --> 25:14.716
Jen!

25:21.756 --> 25:22.857
Jen!

25:24.492 --> 25:26.628
Help! Help!

25:29.931 --> 25:31.666
Jen!

25:36.471 --> 25:37.872
Grab my hand!

25:37.905 --> 25:39.507
Grab my hand!

25:45.213 --> 25:46.514
Jen!

25:46.547 --> 25:49.617
Viktor! Viktor!

25:50.885 --> 25:52.487
Help!

25:52.520 --> 25:55.456
Jen! Faster, Jen!

25:55.490 --> 25:57.358
This way. Come on.

25:57.392 --> 25:59.260
Are you OK?

26:15.009 --> 26:17.478
You're OK. You're alright.

26:17.512 --> 26:18.980
You're alright, darling.

26:25.253 --> 26:26.754
I lost my bag.

26:28.823 --> 26:31.325
OK. We'll find it.

26:31.359 --> 26:34.529
We'd better.

26:34.562 --> 26:36.698
Had my keys in it.

26:43.471 --> 26:46.741
Where in the fuck did
that water come from?

26:51.412 --> 26:53.514
It was the rain, wasn't it?

26:54.549 --> 26:56.851
Didn't you say that we were
on the edge of the storm?

26:56.884 --> 26:59.353
No, that's got to be
more than that.

26:59.387 --> 27:01.689
That river must have
burst its banks.

27:03.291 --> 27:05.793
So, how are we gonna
get out of here, then?

27:19.874 --> 27:22.443
Oh. Here.

27:23.344 --> 27:24.979
- What? Hold on.
- Fuck!

27:25.012 --> 27:26.881
Hold on. Hold on.

27:28.750 --> 27:29.984
Fuck!

27:30.017 --> 27:31.586
Does anyone have service?

27:31.619 --> 27:33.955
There's not gonna be a signal
down here, guys.

27:35.656 --> 27:37.625
We're gonna have to go back
the way we came in.

27:37.658 --> 27:39.761
It's gonna be
underwater.

27:39.794 --> 27:43.397
I'm not going underwater
in this cave. I'm just not. OK?

27:43.431 --> 27:45.466
Look. It's only
a short passage.

27:45.500 --> 27:46.667
Once we clear that low rock,

27:46.701 --> 27:50.404
I reckon we'll be
above the waterline.

27:50.438 --> 27:52.874
Well, we could just wait
for the water to go down

27:52.907 --> 27:53.908
and... and then we'll...

27:53.941 --> 27:55.710
..we'll just swim back out
the way we came in.

27:55.743 --> 27:58.579
- No, we can't wait.
- Why?

27:58.613 --> 28:01.449
The cave's filling up. Look.

28:02.016 --> 28:03.584
The water's still rising.

28:03.618 --> 28:06.921
We're gonna be in the water
whether we like it or not.

28:11.425 --> 28:14.428
Fuck.

28:25.140 --> 28:26.874
Wait. I saw something.

28:27.408 --> 28:29.744
Before the water hit.

28:29.777 --> 28:31.546
What?

28:32.713 --> 28:35.616
It was over there.
I don't know.

28:42.390 --> 28:44.826
I'm not going. I'm not going
back in the water in this cave.

28:44.859 --> 28:47.428
Hey. Look at me.

28:47.461 --> 28:48.729
It's only a short swim.

28:48.763 --> 28:51.632
I'll go first
and check it out, OK?

29:05.513 --> 29:06.948
It's gonna be fine.

29:06.981 --> 29:09.584
Let's just stick together
and stay calm.

29:13.955 --> 29:15.790
You right?

29:26.434 --> 29:27.802
We need to find that backpack.

29:27.835 --> 29:30.571
Alright? We're not going
anywhere without those keys.

29:30.605 --> 29:32.707
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

30:01.535 --> 30:03.471
What's that?

30:17.952 --> 30:19.854
It's Cash's bag.

30:26.194 --> 30:27.962
This is it.

30:27.995 --> 30:31.065
I'll go down and make sure
we can get through.

30:31.098 --> 30:33.534
10, 15 seconds max, I reckon.

30:33.567 --> 30:35.603
Be careful.

30:38.106 --> 30:39.573
What was that?

30:39.607 --> 30:41.609
- Viktor?
- Where did he go?

30:41.642 --> 30:43.945
- Viktor!
- Viktor?

30:45.079 --> 30:46.814
- Viktor!
- Viktor?

30:46.847 --> 30:48.616
Viktor!

30:48.649 --> 30:50.484
- Viktor!
- Viktor, where are you?!

30:50.518 --> 30:52.120
- Viktor?!
- Viktor!

30:52.154 --> 30:54.088
- Viktor!
- Viktor!

30:57.091 --> 30:59.860
- Viktor!
- Stop! Wait!

31:01.028 --> 31:02.697
Get out of the water!

31:02.730 --> 31:04.832
- Viktor!
- Get out of the water!

31:06.567 --> 31:09.637
Viktor!

31:10.238 --> 31:11.806
Viktor!

31:11.839 --> 31:13.141
Viktor! Oh!

31:13.175 --> 31:15.009
Get her out!

31:15.042 --> 31:17.979
Arggh! Viktor!

31:20.047 --> 31:21.048
Viktor!

31:21.082 --> 31:22.150
Eric, get out of the water!

31:22.184 --> 31:24.852
Come on! Come on!

31:27.054 --> 31:29.724
Viktor! Viktor!

31:30.925 --> 31:33.527
Get up! Get up!

31:36.564 --> 31:39.734
Oh, shit! The bag!

31:45.006 --> 31:46.241
Oh, fuck!

31:46.274 --> 31:47.908
It's not Viktor!

31:47.942 --> 31:49.777
Fucking hell!

31:50.811 --> 31:51.413
Viktor!

31:51.446 --> 31:53.115
Viktor!

31:53.148 --> 31:54.815
Viktor! Get out of there!

31:54.849 --> 31:57.252
- Get out!
- Get out of it!

31:57.285 --> 31:58.986
Viktor!

32:00.021 --> 32:01.323
Viktor!

32:01.356 --> 32:04.025
- Viktor!
- Viktor!

32:06.994 --> 32:08.562
Oh! Oh, it's coming!

32:08.596 --> 32:11.266
It's coming!

32:11.299 --> 32:13.834
Get him out of
the fucking water!

32:13.868 --> 32:14.869
Viktor!

32:14.902 --> 32:16.971
It's coming!

32:17.004 --> 32:18.306
Oh!

32:18.340 --> 32:20.007
Get up! Get up!

32:20.041 --> 32:21.343
Run!

32:21.376 --> 32:23.245
No, no, no!

32:23.278 --> 32:25.546
Get up! Get up, get up, get up!

32:27.382 --> 32:29.184
Oh! Viktor!

32:38.859 --> 32:40.861
Viktor. Hey, hey.

32:40.895 --> 32:43.265
Look at me. Look at me.
Can you talk?

32:43.298 --> 32:45.133
- Yeah.
- OK.

32:45.167 --> 32:46.801
Oh, God. Alright.

32:46.834 --> 32:48.270
- Oh, God.
- Oh, shit!

32:48.303 --> 32:49.637
Oh, God.

32:49.670 --> 32:51.139
Is he OK?!

32:51.173 --> 32:53.040
Is he OK?!

32:54.342 --> 32:56.278
Oh, fuck!

32:56.311 --> 32:58.779
He kept
trying to roll me.

33:00.182 --> 33:01.916
Move back in close.

33:01.949 --> 33:03.684
Step back.

33:05.886 --> 33:08.656
Hey, buddy. This is gonna
really hurt, alright?

33:08.689 --> 33:10.125
One, two, three.

33:10.158 --> 33:12.227
- Arggh!
- Sorry. Sorry.

33:14.728 --> 33:16.997
You've got to sit him up.

33:17.031 --> 33:18.400
Up you get. OK.

33:18.433 --> 33:20.235
- I'm gonna come up the back.
- Yep.

33:20.268 --> 33:21.836
Good thing
he spat you out, huh?

33:21.869 --> 33:25.739
Must've not liked
the taste of me, huh?

33:25.773 --> 33:29.043
Good work. Good work.

33:29.076 --> 33:30.945
Thanks.

33:32.147 --> 33:34.349
We need to get him
to a hospital.

34:00.841 --> 34:04.044
This is one of our
missing bushwalkers.

34:15.922 --> 34:18.260
Those painkillers
should kick in soon, alright?

34:30.338 --> 34:32.139
Cash and I will go.

34:32.174 --> 34:33.774
What?

34:33.806 --> 34:35.443
Cash!

34:40.848 --> 34:43.050
We've got to swim
out of here, mate.

34:45.786 --> 34:47.422
Did you miss something?

34:47.455 --> 34:50.358
There's a massive fucking
crocodile in this water!

34:50.391 --> 34:53.793
Yeah. Is your phone
still waterproof?

34:53.827 --> 34:55.829
Yes!

34:55.862 --> 34:57.063
OK.

34:57.097 --> 34:59.334
So we get back to the entrance,
get a signal, call for help.

34:59.367 --> 35:00.868
While we're at it,
we grab your gun,

35:00.901 --> 35:02.304
come back here
and kill the bastard.

35:03.505 --> 35:05.072
Look, we just need
to get through there

35:05.106 --> 35:06.308
and we'll be fine.

35:06.341 --> 35:08.909
Oh, we'll be fine, will be?
Yeah... No!

35:08.943 --> 35:10.945
I've got my knife.

35:10.978 --> 35:13.481
That fucking croc comes for us,
he's gonna get it in the head.

35:13.515 --> 35:17.219
Great.
It's bloody Crocodile Dundee.

35:17.252 --> 35:19.387
You can't be serious.

35:19.421 --> 35:21.055
- He needs a hospital.
- Eric.

35:21.088 --> 35:22.257
- Jen.
- Don't be stupid.

35:22.290 --> 35:23.458
We're all gonna be
in the water soon.

35:23.491 --> 35:25.393
Crocs are territorial.

35:25.427 --> 35:27.429
He's not gonna be happy
till we're all gone.

35:27.462 --> 35:29.997
We have to try something.

35:31.299 --> 35:33.501
Mate, this is madness!

35:34.269 --> 35:36.338
I'm not doing it.
I'm not doing it.

35:36.371 --> 35:38.440
Nup. Nuh. Fuck you.

35:46.114 --> 35:47.915
What?!

36:00.428 --> 36:02.564
Eric, you cannot get
in that water.

36:02.597 --> 36:04.532
What choice do I have?

36:14.908 --> 36:16.877
W-wait! Wait!

36:18.146 --> 36:19.880
Just wait a minute!

36:26.454 --> 36:28.390
What's he saying?

36:29.923 --> 36:31.293
Cash!

36:31.326 --> 36:32.560
Alright!

36:34.629 --> 36:36.364
Yeah?

36:42.002 --> 36:43.471
Alright, this is what
we're gonna do.

36:43.505 --> 36:46.840
We're gonna push that
out there,

36:46.874 --> 36:49.009
and when the croc grabs it,
we go.

36:49.043 --> 36:51.011
You got it?

36:54.249 --> 36:56.050
That might just work.

36:57.352 --> 36:58.986
Let's do it.

37:31.219 --> 37:32.886
Aaah!

38:14.061 --> 38:18.065
Go. Whatever you do, right,
don't splash.

38:18.098 --> 38:19.267
Careful.

38:19.300 --> 38:21.902
They're attracted to
vibrations, OK?

38:27.675 --> 38:30.412
Slowly! Slow!

38:39.354 --> 38:41.322
Attaboy.

38:42.290 --> 38:44.057
OK.

39:07.449 --> 39:09.651
Jesus.

39:16.391 --> 39:18.326
Oh, shit.

40:09.511 --> 40:11.479
Stick together.

40:55.123 --> 40:57.725
- You good?
- Yeah. Yeah.

41:33.828 --> 41:36.331
Shit.

41:38.366 --> 41:40.168
What's that?

41:50.244 --> 41:51.813
Just keep moving.

42:05.493 --> 42:07.195
Fuck!

42:08.796 --> 42:10.798
- What?
- I felt something.

42:11.666 --> 42:13.201
You sure?

42:13.234 --> 42:14.802
Yes!

42:16.437 --> 42:17.505
Hang on.

42:17.538 --> 42:19.440
What are you doing?

42:37.358 --> 42:39.494
Nothing.

42:41.362 --> 42:42.897
Let's keep moving.

43:08.022 --> 43:09.791
Hey.

43:09.824 --> 43:12.293
Here you go.

43:15.463 --> 43:16.698
- Yolanda?
- Yep?

43:16.731 --> 43:19.367
Uh... have you got, uh,
Viktor's puffer?

43:19.400 --> 43:22.270
- He said it's in your pack.
- Yep.

43:22.303 --> 43:25.273
Take some deep breaths,
alright? OK?

43:25.306 --> 43:26.774
Oh...

43:26.808 --> 43:27.642
Yep.

43:27.675 --> 43:30.311
It's OK, buddy.

43:30.344 --> 43:32.747
Throw it over!

43:32.780 --> 43:34.248
Come on, Yolanda,
throw it over!

43:34.282 --> 43:35.983
- He's suffocating!
- Yes!

43:41.055 --> 43:43.024
Fuck!

43:47.428 --> 43:50.732
Uh... Do you have
another one of those?

43:54.635 --> 43:56.304
- No!
- Slow down.

43:56.337 --> 43:58.806
Hey. It's OK. It's OK.

43:58.840 --> 44:01.576
Look at me. Look at me.
It's coming. OK?

44:01.609 --> 44:04.612
You're gonna be just fine.
It's OK.

44:08.049 --> 44:09.851
Hey, hey, hey... It's OK.

44:09.884 --> 44:11.486
It's OK. It's OK.

44:11.519 --> 44:13.755
It's OK. It's OK.

44:13.788 --> 44:16.891
Calm down. Calm breaths.
Calm breaths.

44:16.924 --> 44:18.626
It's OK.

44:20.394 --> 44:21.462
Calm down.

44:24.799 --> 44:26.534
Yolanda, no!

44:30.471 --> 44:31.973
Slowly!

44:32.940 --> 44:34.976
Gently.

44:35.009 --> 44:37.478
Don't splash, OK?

44:37.512 --> 44:38.980
Fuck.

44:41.082 --> 44:42.884
Fuck.

45:00.935 --> 45:02.436
Yes!

45:05.506 --> 45:07.074
Aah!

45:18.519 --> 45:19.954
Do not move.

45:19.987 --> 45:22.490
Do not move a muscle.

45:46.447 --> 45:48.749
Aah!

45:48.783 --> 45:49.917
Go!

45:49.951 --> 45:52.753
Go. Go, go, go, go, go!

45:52.787 --> 45:54.555
Come on.

45:58.459 --> 46:00.061
Come on.

46:00.094 --> 46:01.863
Come on.

46:03.497 --> 46:05.700
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

46:09.637 --> 46:10.905
Here.

46:10.938 --> 46:13.007
Breathe. Breathe.

46:13.040 --> 46:14.809
Again.

46:14.842 --> 46:16.178
Breathe.

46:23.517 --> 46:26.888
Hi. It's OK.

46:28.623 --> 46:31.726
I'm here. I'm here.

47:13.701 --> 47:14.936
That hole we dropped into,

47:14.969 --> 47:17.505
it should be
on the other side of this.

47:21.008 --> 47:22.743
It's a bit of a swim.

47:27.215 --> 47:28.983
Give me your phone.

47:29.016 --> 47:31.686
Hey?

47:31.719 --> 47:34.655
No point both of us
drowning in that crack.

47:37.024 --> 47:38.960
If you think I'm letting you
have all the glory...

47:48.803 --> 47:50.571
I'll see you on the other side.

47:50.604 --> 47:52.740
- Righto.
- Yeah?

48:44.992 --> 48:46.861
Aah!

48:50.265 --> 48:52.767
- No way through.
- How? It's...

48:52.800 --> 48:55.903
The water... must have
moved the rocks.

48:58.306 --> 49:01.143
We've got to try to move 'em.

49:01.176 --> 49:04.279
- Let's do it.
- OK.

49:36.744 --> 49:38.280
Fuck!

49:43.218 --> 49:45.853
We gotta... we gotta
go back down.

49:47.688 --> 49:50.258
Mate, those rocks
aren't going anywhere.

49:50.292 --> 49:52.626
We have to go back.

49:55.163 --> 49:56.864
Come on.

49:58.099 --> 49:59.934
Just give me a sec.

51:23.817 --> 51:25.353
Eric?!

51:28.223 --> 51:31.892
Fuck. Fuck...

51:40.034 --> 51:41.802
Eric?

53:54.935 --> 53:56.937
Aaagh!

54:00.941 --> 54:03.345
Aaagh! Aaaagh!

54:30.705 --> 54:32.906
Cash?!

54:34.309 --> 54:36.444
Cash!

55:00.268 --> 55:02.203
Fuck.

55:02.237 --> 55:04.004
Cash!

55:11.044 --> 55:13.080
Water's still rising.

55:40.108 --> 55:41.676
There's a breeze.

56:02.095 --> 56:03.631
Hey.

56:05.032 --> 56:08.169
It's OK. It's OK.

56:09.404 --> 56:12.005
We're gonna get out of here.

56:12.039 --> 56:14.108
- OK?
- Yeah.

56:14.142 --> 56:15.677
We have to.

56:17.145 --> 56:19.581
Yes, boss.

56:26.788 --> 56:28.523
Viktor, I'm pregnant.

56:33.595 --> 56:37.398
- You're gonna be a dad.
- Yeah.

56:39.834 --> 56:42.170
- I'm gonna be a dad?
- I was gonna tell you... Yeah.

56:44.339 --> 56:46.808
- I was gonna tell you.
- Yeah.

56:46.841 --> 56:50.512
I've just been waiting
for the right time.

56:53.581 --> 56:56.083
- I'm gonna be a daddy.
- Yeah.

56:59.487 --> 57:01.723
Hey?

57:15.870 --> 57:17.805
Hey, I found a passage.

57:21.743 --> 57:23.811
Look.

57:31.119 --> 57:32.420
Here.

57:32.453 --> 57:34.722
Oh, baby.

57:56.444 --> 57:58.580
Where's Cash?

58:01.716 --> 58:03.484
He, um...

58:06.888 --> 58:08.590
What?

58:09.791 --> 58:11.559
Oh, God.

58:11.593 --> 58:13.695
Oh!

58:17.532 --> 58:20.668
Oh. Oh, fuck.

58:31.713 --> 58:34.415
Well, did you find a way
out of here?

58:37.518 --> 58:39.220
No, it's blocked.

58:39.253 --> 58:41.422
We can't get out that way.

58:56.270 --> 58:58.272
Hey, I think I found a passage.

58:58.306 --> 59:00.408
- What?
- It's up there.

59:05.380 --> 59:07.615
Hey, Jen. Where's the Ventolin?

59:09.751 --> 59:10.952
Careful.

59:10.985 --> 59:12.220
Hey.

59:12.253 --> 59:16.290
It's pretty tight, but I think
I might be able to squeeze in.

59:16.324 --> 59:19.193
- Eric?
- Hey, it's alright. I'll go.

59:19.227 --> 59:21.796
We need to find a way
out of here.

59:49.991 --> 59:51.926
- You OK?
- Yeah.

59:55.663 --> 59:57.732
This whole place is
gonna be flooded soon.

59:59.667 --> 01:00:01.669
We need to get Viktor out.

01:00:03.838 --> 01:00:06.507
We will. We will.

01:00:10.445 --> 01:00:11.979
Eric, I'm pregnant.

01:00:18.486 --> 01:00:20.455
Have you told Viktor?

01:00:21.789 --> 01:00:24.193
Yeah. Just now.

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:40.975
Here.

01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:47.882
That should help take
the temperature down.

01:01:00.695 --> 01:01:02.296
Oh, God.

01:01:06.101 --> 01:01:07.869
The water's really rising.

01:01:27.655 --> 01:01:29.457
Hey.

01:01:30.324 --> 01:01:32.660
Do you think you can
make it up there?

01:01:34.529 --> 01:01:38.566
We've gotta move, OK?
Or we're gonna go under.

01:01:39.767 --> 01:01:41.803
Yeah.

01:01:41.836 --> 01:01:43.004
I think so.

01:01:43.037 --> 01:01:44.705
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:01:44.739 --> 01:01:46.607
OK.

01:03:04.552 --> 01:03:06.821
OK. I got you.

01:03:19.066 --> 01:03:21.469
Hang on.

01:03:26.574 --> 01:03:28.476
OK, we're there.

01:03:32.046 --> 01:03:34.482
It's OK.

01:04:47.088 --> 01:04:48.823
Aarggh!

01:04:52.227 --> 01:04:53.661
OK, that's it!

01:04:53.694 --> 01:04:55.297
Come on, buddy.

01:04:55.330 --> 01:04:57.199
Gotta get up here.

01:04:57.232 --> 01:04:58.833
Come on.

01:04:58.866 --> 01:05:01.169
You have to get up here.
You can do this.

01:05:01.203 --> 01:05:02.803
Get up!

01:05:02.837 --> 01:05:04.071
Get up here!

01:05:04.106 --> 01:05:05.706
Oh!

01:05:07.242 --> 01:05:08.876
Come on.

01:05:08.909 --> 01:05:10.745
Get up! Come on!

01:05:13.948 --> 01:05:15.950
Come on! Arggh!

01:05:38.906 --> 01:05:40.641
Here.

01:06:15.042 --> 01:06:17.345
Yolanda's pregnant.

01:06:21.283 --> 01:06:22.983
I know.

01:06:26.154 --> 01:06:27.888
It's amazing.

01:06:29.224 --> 01:06:31.259
I'm so happy for you guys.

01:06:33.828 --> 01:06:36.063
We never thought
we could have kids.

01:06:37.265 --> 01:06:40.835
After all the chemo,
I thought I was sterile.

01:06:41.969 --> 01:06:43.804
It's incredible.

01:07:14.702 --> 01:07:16.271
Fuck!

01:07:26.814 --> 01:07:28.883
We're never gonna get
out of here, are we?

01:07:32.086 --> 01:07:33.821
We will.

01:07:36.324 --> 01:07:38.058
Of course we will.

01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:10.151
What?

01:09:10.185 --> 01:09:11.952
What?

01:09:11.986 --> 01:09:13.886
You're OK.

01:09:14.589 --> 01:09:17.359
- You're OK.
- Are they back?

01:09:18.859 --> 01:09:20.462
No.

01:09:30.970 --> 01:09:33.375
Yolanda's so sure
of herself, isn't she?

01:09:35.210 --> 01:09:36.511
It's funny, um...

01:09:36.544 --> 01:09:39.046
Those two have always been
the adventurous ones

01:09:39.078 --> 01:09:41.448
and...

01:09:41.483 --> 01:09:44.084
..you and I, we always just
wanted to sit by the pool.

01:09:50.292 --> 01:09:53.827
I used to joke
with Eric that...

01:09:53.861 --> 01:09:56.096
..maybe we should
switch partners.

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:00.135
He'd laugh.

01:10:10.645 --> 01:10:12.414
Look.

01:10:14.382 --> 01:10:16.418
The keys.

01:10:17.385 --> 01:10:19.354
Cash's pack.

01:10:22.157 --> 01:10:24.992
Here. Hold this.

01:10:25.025 --> 01:10:27.429
Hey. Wait.

01:10:29.464 --> 01:10:32.300
- Jen...
- We need them to get back.

01:10:32.334 --> 01:10:35.035
Hey, wait. Wait.

01:10:35.069 --> 01:10:37.071
Jen.

01:10:38.139 --> 01:10:39.873
Jen.

01:11:18.011 --> 01:11:20.013
Hey.

01:11:39.066 --> 01:11:41.935
OK. OK. OK.

01:12:07.262 --> 01:12:08.962
Fuck!

01:12:23.211 --> 01:12:25.580
Jen! Jen, I think it's coming!

01:12:26.548 --> 01:12:28.650
Jen, get out of the water!

01:12:28.683 --> 01:12:30.418
Jen!

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:41.094
Jen?

01:12:42.130 --> 01:12:43.665
Jen.

01:12:46.734 --> 01:12:48.536
Jen.

01:12:51.139 --> 01:12:52.674
Jen, can you hear me?

01:12:55.777 --> 01:12:57.779
Oh, shit.

01:13:01.081 --> 01:13:03.016
Shit. Jen.

01:13:04.285 --> 01:13:05.753
Aarggh!

01:13:07.087 --> 01:13:08.256
Jen.

01:13:08.289 --> 01:13:10.124
Wake up.

01:13:10.158 --> 01:13:12.560
Come on! Come on!

01:13:14.061 --> 01:13:15.563
Come on!

01:13:17.165 --> 01:13:18.800
Come on!

01:13:58.239 --> 01:13:59.407
Viktor?

01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:01.442
Viktor! Viktor!

01:14:01.476 --> 01:14:03.478
Come on, Viktor!

01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:15.356
Oh!

01:15:10.244 --> 01:15:11.779
Jen.

01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:14.716
Huh?

01:15:14.749 --> 01:15:16.517
Jen!

01:15:17.852 --> 01:15:19.420
I'm over here.

01:15:19.454 --> 01:15:22.457
Shit. OK.

01:15:22.490 --> 01:15:26.628
Um... we're gonna have to swim.

01:15:26.661 --> 01:15:29.864
It's not far.
We'll stick together, OK?

01:16:35.463 --> 01:16:36.998
Hey. Are you alright?

01:16:37.031 --> 01:16:38.966
Where's Viktor?

01:16:41.669 --> 01:16:42.904
Jen?

01:16:42.937 --> 01:16:44.739
What?

01:16:48.476 --> 01:16:50.278
He, um...

01:16:57.018 --> 01:16:59.487
Uh... you OK?

01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:02.523
You OK?

01:17:07.929 --> 01:17:09.330
Wait, did you...

01:17:09.363 --> 01:17:11.799
Did you find a way out?
Did you get out?

01:17:13.367 --> 01:17:14.902
No, we can't get out that way.

01:17:19.907 --> 01:17:21.542
Fuck!

01:17:21.576 --> 01:17:24.846
Why did you bring us down here?
Why did you bring us here?!

01:17:24.879 --> 01:17:26.047
Jen, just calm down.

01:17:26.080 --> 01:17:27.448
We're gonna fucking die
down here!

01:17:27.482 --> 01:17:28.983
Fuck, Jen, you wanted to come.

01:17:29.016 --> 01:17:32.487
- No, I didn't!
- OK, I get it! It's my fault!

01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:54.675
When were you gonna tell me?

01:17:56.911 --> 01:17:58.613
About the two of you?

01:18:04.018 --> 01:18:07.522
- Jen, come on. What the fuck?
- I know, Eric.

01:18:09.390 --> 01:18:10.992
Just tell me the truth.

01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:14.996
Please just tell me the truth.

01:18:34.448 --> 01:18:36.450
It wasn't an affair.

01:18:38.986 --> 01:18:40.621
Then what was it?

01:18:44.425 --> 01:18:46.494
It was a mistake.

01:18:49.030 --> 01:18:50.865
A mistake?

01:18:59.540 --> 01:19:01.576
Is the baby yours?

01:19:28.903 --> 01:19:30.938
Oh, God.

01:19:48.489 --> 01:19:50.024
Look.

01:19:52.227 --> 01:19:53.427
Sunlight.

01:19:53.461 --> 01:19:56.998
There must be a shaft. The
light's coming in through it.

01:19:59.201 --> 01:20:00.635
It's a down current.

01:20:00.668 --> 01:20:02.204
See the way the water eddies
near the wall?

01:20:02.237 --> 01:20:03.804
So?

01:20:03.838 --> 01:20:06.440
So... it means
the water must be

01:20:06.474 --> 01:20:08.509
getting sucked out there
somewhere.

01:20:15.082 --> 01:20:16.484
Like a plughole.

01:20:16.517 --> 01:20:18.619
It could be a way out.

01:20:19.321 --> 01:20:21.522
We don't know it's a way out.

01:20:21.555 --> 01:20:24.959
We could get sucked down there
and drown.

01:20:24.992 --> 01:20:27.028
Well, it's that
or wait here to get eaten.

01:20:28.529 --> 01:20:30.998
We could get eaten
swimming over there.

01:20:31.032 --> 01:20:32.667
Yeah?

01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:35.069
Well, I'd rather
take my chances.

01:20:36.938 --> 01:20:38.606
Jen...

01:20:38.639 --> 01:20:39.907
What, Eric?

01:20:39.941 --> 01:20:42.877
You want to stay here too
and wait to die?

01:20:57.591 --> 01:21:00.027
Oh, fuck!

01:22:52.039 --> 01:22:54.075
Hey. You're OK.

01:22:54.109 --> 01:22:56.744
You're OK. Just keep swimming.
Keep swimming.

01:22:56.777 --> 01:22:59.680
Nice and slow. You're OK.

01:23:01.249 --> 01:23:03.318
Oh, shit.

01:23:33.348 --> 01:23:34.815
It's coming!

01:23:34.849 --> 01:23:37.084
Swim! Swim!

01:23:40.288 --> 01:23:42.357
Go!

01:23:49.763 --> 01:23:51.266
Help me!

01:23:51.299 --> 01:23:53.368
Ah! Ah!

01:23:54.469 --> 01:23:57.004
Come on, you bastard! Come on!

01:24:01.243 --> 01:24:02.377
Eric!

01:24:02.410 --> 01:24:04.279
- Go!
- Eric!

01:24:04.312 --> 01:24:06.080
- Go!
- No!

01:24:06.114 --> 01:24:09.384
Eric! Come back here! Eric!

01:24:09.417 --> 01:24:11.319
Eric, come back here!

01:24:11.353 --> 01:24:13.888
Eric?

01:24:13.921 --> 01:24:15.123
Arggh!

01:24:16.258 --> 01:24:17.892
Arggh!

01:24:17.925 --> 01:24:19.394
Eric!

01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:24.732
Arggh!

01:24:24.765 --> 01:24:26.101
Eric?

01:24:27.067 --> 01:24:28.802
Oh!

01:25:04.439 --> 01:25:07.209
You're OK.

01:25:20.288 --> 01:25:22.123
Eric?

01:25:33.201 --> 01:25:35.370
Oh, fuck.

01:25:37.305 --> 01:25:40.074
Come on. Come on.

01:25:51.419 --> 01:25:53.854
What the fuck is this place?

01:25:58.159 --> 01:25:59.261
Ohhh!

01:25:59.294 --> 01:26:01.762
We have to get out of here.

01:26:02.896 --> 01:26:04.165
Which way?!

01:26:10.004 --> 01:26:11.839
Look!

01:26:13.208 --> 01:26:15.277
Is that a way out?

01:26:16.611 --> 01:26:18.546
Go! Go!

01:26:18.580 --> 01:26:20.482
That's it.

01:26:41.001 --> 01:26:42.870
Come on!

01:26:46.441 --> 01:26:48.610
- OK.
- Quick, quick, quick!

01:27:01.088 --> 01:27:03.425
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:27:06.361 --> 01:27:08.363
Oh, God.

01:27:11.333 --> 01:27:13.501
This is the road
we came in on, isn't it?

01:27:14.636 --> 01:27:16.471
I think so.

01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:07.355
Jen.

01:28:08.423 --> 01:28:10.023
I'm so sorry.

01:28:10.057 --> 01:28:11.459
Not now.

01:28:44.125 --> 01:28:45.460
Look out!

01:28:58.740 --> 01:29:00.941
Oh, God. Fuck.

01:29:02.009 --> 01:29:03.211
Yolanda, are you OK?

01:29:03.244 --> 01:29:04.978
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

01:29:05.012 --> 01:29:07.382
- We have to get out of here.
- Oh, shit!

01:29:07.415 --> 01:29:09.517
- Come on.
- Oh! Oh, my God!

01:29:09.551 --> 01:29:11.453
Come on. Oh, come on!

01:29:11.486 --> 01:29:13.755
- Can you open your door?
- I can't!

01:29:13.788 --> 01:29:15.523
Come on.

01:29:18.793 --> 01:29:21.329
This is where
we just came out of.

01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:28.102
Oh, my God.

01:29:34.142 --> 01:29:35.443
Oh, shit!

01:29:35.477 --> 01:29:37.412
Oh, shit!

01:29:37.445 --> 01:29:39.314
Oh, my God!

01:29:39.347 --> 01:29:40.648
The gun! The gun!

01:29:40.682 --> 01:29:44.185
Oh, my God! Get the gun!
Quick, quick, quick! Get it!

01:29:44.219 --> 01:29:45.986
Did you find it?

01:29:47.054 --> 01:29:48.490
We need the clip.

01:29:51.292 --> 01:29:53.093
- Come on!
- Here you go.

01:29:54.195 --> 01:29:56.164
- OK. It's OK.
- OK.

01:29:57.665 --> 01:29:59.367
Where is it?

01:30:17.485 --> 01:30:19.821
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

01:30:19.854 --> 01:30:22.657
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, shit! Oh, my God!

01:30:22.690 --> 01:30:24.726
No! No!

01:30:46.147 --> 01:30:47.582
Yolanda!

01:30:48.616 --> 01:30:51.753
Yolanda! Yolanda!

01:30:51.786 --> 01:30:53.588
Oh, God!

01:31:00.695 --> 01:31:04.365
- Are you OK?
- My ankle!

01:31:04.399 --> 01:31:06.434
Can you swim?

01:31:06.467 --> 01:31:08.770
We gotta swim down there.

01:31:08.803 --> 01:31:10.438
Come on!

01:31:29.490 --> 01:31:32.226
Nearly there.

01:32:23.845 --> 01:32:25.813
Jen!

01:32:28.983 --> 01:32:31.219
Jen!

01:32:31.252 --> 01:32:33.454
Jen!

01:32:45.433 --> 01:32:47.835
Jen!

01:32:51.339 --> 01:32:53.641
Jen!

01:32:57.478 --> 01:32:59.814
Jen!

01:33:06.287 --> 01:33:07.989
Jen!

01:33:08.022 --> 01:33:09.991
Jen!

01:33:10.024 --> 01:33:12.727
Jen!

01:33:27.442 --> 01:33:30.511
Jen!

01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:01.008
Are you OK?

01:34:04.846 --> 01:34:06.781
Yeah.

01:34:13.321 --> 01:34:14.922
Come on, then.

01:34:18.359 --> 01:34:20.828
I'm sorry. I love you.

01:34:39.903 --> 01:34:44.903
