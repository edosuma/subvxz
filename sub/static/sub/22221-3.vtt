WEBVTT

00:07.800 --> 00:10.337
(panting)

00:28.946 --> 00:30.322
( groans )

00:32.366 --> 00:33.867
Son of a...!

00:41.250 --> 00:42.535
Crichton.

00:43.669 --> 00:45.000
What are you breaking now?

00:45.087 --> 00:47.248
I'm not breaking anything.

00:47.340 --> 00:50.332
I'm trying to see how our
quote-unquote navigation system

00:50.426 --> 00:52.337
quote-unquote works.

00:52.428 --> 00:54.259
You got a microt?

00:54.347 --> 00:56.429
Ain't got no time
right now, Chi.

00:58.434 --> 01:00.550
Crichton, I, uh...

01:00.645 --> 01:02.306
I really got to talk.

01:02.396 --> 01:03.351
Chi!

01:03.439 --> 01:06.806
I do not have the time.

01:08.277 --> 01:11.019
You don't have the time?

01:11.113 --> 01:12.899
Okay.

01:17.370 --> 01:19.406
Ah! Son of a...

01:36.639 --> 01:38.379
( groans )

01:38.474 --> 01:40.385
(panting)

01:45.982 --> 01:48.519
(groaning)

01:51.237 --> 01:54.149
( pulsating )

01:56.867 --> 01:57.697
No.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.491
( pulsating stops )

02:00.997 --> 02:02.612
Nerri.

02:23.853 --> 02:25.593
(yells)

02:28.274 --> 02:30.811
Aeryn:
That little tralk!

02:30.901 --> 02:33.984
Aeryn, we don't know that
Chiana stole your Prowler.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.277
It's gone, isn't it, Crichton?

02:35.364 --> 02:38.071
I did not immediately detect
her departure

02:38.159 --> 02:41.993
because several of my control
systems have been offline.

02:42.079 --> 02:44.536
She could be thousands of
metras away by now.

02:44.623 --> 02:46.124
We found this in the
Maintenance Bay.

02:46.208 --> 02:48.995
It had Chiana's blood
all over it.

02:49.086 --> 02:50.246
What is it?

02:50.338 --> 02:51.578
I believe it's a Life Disc.

02:51.672 --> 02:54.209
Some species have them
surgically implanted.

02:54.300 --> 02:58.259
This creates a permanent life
link between those
close to them.

02:58.346 --> 02:59.461
Then why would she take it out?

02:59.555 --> 03:01.466
It is no longer functioning.

03:01.557 --> 03:05.345
Which means that whoever
Chiana was linked to...

03:05.436 --> 03:06.972
is dead.

03:07.646 --> 03:10.103
Oh, man.

03:10.191 --> 03:12.933
She was trying to talk to me,
and I blew her off.

03:15.613 --> 03:18.104
(thundering)

03:25.748 --> 03:29.240
Come on. You've been
in worse places.

03:32.630 --> 03:34.291
Who's there?!

03:34.382 --> 03:36.373
Stop pleeking around!

03:37.885 --> 03:39.841
Lemme see you!

03:46.352 --> 03:47.683
( screams )

03:53.818 --> 03:55.354
( snarling )

04:02.368 --> 04:04.575
Sweet nixar.

04:11.168 --> 04:13.204
Let's mark her.

04:15.089 --> 04:16.454
(Chiana screaming)

04:20.052 --> 04:22.213
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

04:22.304 --> 04:25.467
A radiation wave hit and I got
shot through a wormhole.

04:25.558 --> 04:28.220
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship,

04:28.310 --> 04:31.894
a living ship, full of strange
alien life-forms.

04:31.981 --> 04:32.720
Help me.

04:32.815 --> 04:34.271
Listen, please.

04:34.358 --> 04:36.189
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

04:36.277 --> 04:40.270
I'm being hunted by an insane
military commander.

04:40.364 --> 04:42.730
I'm doing everything I can.

04:42.825 --> 04:45.658
I'm just looking for
a way home.

05:31.874 --> 05:34.411
So this entire planet's
covered in graves.

05:34.502 --> 05:37.084
It's a Royal Cemetery Planet.

05:37.171 --> 05:39.207
Haven't you ever seen one?

05:40.424 --> 05:41.709
Nope.

05:42.635 --> 05:45.172
Chiana!

05:45.262 --> 05:47.924
Well, where did you bury
your leaders on Erp?

05:48.015 --> 05:50.347
Just underground.

05:50.768 --> 05:52.178
Chiana!

05:52.269 --> 05:53.805
Next to where you lived?

05:53.896 --> 05:56.433
That's disgusting. Ugh!

06:00.528 --> 06:04.737
Aeryn:
Well, the Prowler checked out
all right. At least she landed it in one piece.

06:04.823 --> 06:06.814
Let's go. You can take
the Transport.

06:06.909 --> 06:09.821
No. These belong to Chiana.

06:13.165 --> 06:14.575
You coming?

06:16.001 --> 06:17.502
(moans)

06:17.586 --> 06:18.871
Let's go.

06:18.963 --> 06:21.204
Rygel:
What are you talking about?

06:21.298 --> 06:23.289
I'm not going anywhere.

06:23.384 --> 06:25.375
I'm staying right here.

06:25.469 --> 06:27.380
Yeah, like anybody cares.

06:30.975 --> 06:32.806
Don't rob the graves, sparky!

06:32.893 --> 06:37.227
How dare you imply that a
Hynerian Dominar would...

06:37.314 --> 06:39.145
deseHJ

06:41.402 --> 06:43.358
(grunting)

06:56.875 --> 06:58.661
Yotza!

07:08.679 --> 07:10.215
Does this look familiar?

07:10.306 --> 07:11.796
Of course it looks familiar.

07:11.890 --> 07:14.347
That's because each of these
tunnels are exactly the same.

07:15.686 --> 07:18.393
Are we lost?

07:18.480 --> 07:20.562
(muffled moans and shrieks)

07:27.573 --> 07:29.905
(moaning)

07:33.704 --> 07:35.410
What are they doing to her?

07:35.497 --> 07:36.828
l have no idea.

07:36.915 --> 07:38.655
Do you see any weapons?

07:39.293 --> 07:40.248
No.

07:40.336 --> 07:41.371
I'll go for Chiana.

07:41.462 --> 07:43.168
l'll pin down the others.

07:47.718 --> 07:50.334
Everybody down!
On the ground now!
-Chiana!

07:50.429 --> 07:51.589
Move it!

07:52.264 --> 07:53.800
What are you doing?!

07:53.891 --> 07:56.598
No one's ever lasted more than
50 microts in that thing.

07:57.311 --> 07:59.222
I had 'em beat.

08:00.731 --> 08:02.972
Aeryn:
lwouldn't if I were you.

08:04.443 --> 08:06.684
You had no right to
come after me.

08:06.779 --> 08:10.021
We were worried about
you, so we...
-How sweet!

08:10.115 --> 08:11.776
Now get the frell out of here.

08:11.867 --> 08:14.279
Chiana.
-No, Crichton.

08:14.370 --> 08:16.986
Now I don't have the time.

08:21.877 --> 08:23.208
Hey, ancient.

08:23.295 --> 08:26.207
Who the hell are you
talking to?

08:26.298 --> 08:27.583
And who are you?

08:28.384 --> 08:29.715
Molnon.

08:33.722 --> 08:35.303
Taste?

08:36.100 --> 08:38.011
Look at her.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.976
Wow.

08:42.898 --> 08:45.139
Vyna's amazed by you.

08:45.234 --> 08:47.566
Age lines, dead spots.

08:47.653 --> 08:48.984
You're historic, nixar.

08:49.071 --> 08:50.311
Historic?

08:51.907 --> 08:55.320
Molnon:
Let's go, Gardas.
They're worn out.

08:56.704 --> 08:59.411
Ancients.

09:04.545 --> 09:06.251
Did you catch any of that?

09:06.338 --> 09:10.126
Not much, except all the
"I'm worn out" dren.

09:14.179 --> 09:16.886
If you find Chiana, show her
this, ask her about it.

09:16.974 --> 09:18.180
Ask her yourself.

09:18.267 --> 09:19.256
Aeryn.

09:19.351 --> 09:21.683
She's pissed at me.

09:24.773 --> 09:28.391
And try not to be too angry
about the Prowler.

09:28.485 --> 09:29.816
Be nice.

09:29.903 --> 09:32.110
I'm not good at nice.

09:32.197 --> 09:34.188
Just don't shoot her.

09:41.373 --> 09:45.707
Okay, Rygel. Take me through
this one more time.

09:45.794 --> 09:47.625
Why did you leave?

09:47.713 --> 09:50.295
I told you. They left me first.

09:50.382 --> 09:53.044
Pilot lost contact with Crichton
and Aeryn several arns ago.

09:53.135 --> 09:54.841
Where did they go?

09:54.928 --> 09:55.917
Down.

09:56.013 --> 09:57.344
Underground.

09:57.431 --> 09:59.843
They went looking for Chiana.

09:59.933 --> 10:03.676
Crichton seems to think she
might still be alive.

10:09.735 --> 10:12.226
You frelling Luxan.

10:13.614 --> 10:15.150
What is this?

10:15.240 --> 10:18.152
My private property.

10:19.286 --> 10:20.696
You robbed the dead.

10:20.788 --> 10:25.031
And believe me, that wasn't
as easy as it sounds.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.332
Now leave me alone.

10:27.419 --> 10:29.535
Yes, that's right.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.871
Get out.

10:58.659 --> 11:00.399
Bonus.

11:15.968 --> 11:17.378
What do you want?

11:18.262 --> 11:19.843
You forgot this.

11:33.318 --> 11:35.980
It's my brother. Nerri.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.486
He's terminated.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.073
It means he's dead.

11:51.461 --> 11:53.998
I'm sorry.

11:54.089 --> 11:56.330
Hey, I got to show you
around this place.

11:56.425 --> 11:59.167
You know what they do if
they want you to stay?

11:59.261 --> 12:01.798
They make you run through these,
these, these rings of fire,

12:01.889 --> 12:04.096
like, um, naked.

12:04.182 --> 12:05.922
Totally naked.

12:10.439 --> 12:12.270
That's where I just was.

12:12.357 --> 12:15.190
Your whole body, it vibrates.
It's...

12:15.277 --> 12:17.643
You got to try it.

12:17.738 --> 12:21.731
I think you had a little bit
too much to drink.

12:21.825 --> 12:23.611
Don't be like Crichton.

12:24.745 --> 12:27.657
Come on. Everyone's so
lame on Moya.

12:28.749 --> 12:30.535
Stay with me.

12:31.209 --> 12:32.995
You gotta.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.542
Or at least stay for
the Gathering.

12:34.630 --> 12:36.211
And what is that?

12:36.298 --> 12:39.165
Well, Molnon says it's
the dradest.

12:39.968 --> 12:42.380
Says it'll blow my mind.

13:13.961 --> 13:15.701
Hey, guy.
We didn't meet before.

13:15.796 --> 13:17.411
It's too late.

13:17.506 --> 13:19.337
I don't know what you're
talking about.

13:20.842 --> 13:22.298
The Lost People know...

13:22.386 --> 13:23.592
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:23.679 --> 13:25.920
Focus, man. Come on.
Focus right here.

13:26.348 --> 13:28.213
Das.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.469
Time to jump, garda.

14:12.394 --> 14:14.726
New narl emerges.

14:14.813 --> 14:16.849
Clans gather.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.311
It's time to celebrate!

14:24.197 --> 14:28.782
Way back, the ancients dug
the Royal Tombs.

14:28.869 --> 14:31.201
But the surface is full,

14:31.288 --> 14:33.199
and the Royals leave.

14:34.916 --> 14:36.656
Now we alone.

14:36.752 --> 14:38.663
( chuckles )

14:39.337 --> 14:41.328
But we live.

14:47.721 --> 14:49.837
We take the Stone.

14:53.268 --> 14:57.386
(deep reverberating hum )

15:01.818 --> 15:05.481
(hum continues)

15:17.709 --> 15:19.574
(hum stops)

15:21.213 --> 15:23.329
Ahh!

15:24.132 --> 15:25.121
What the...?

15:25.217 --> 15:27.708
Frell. It's a sonic net.

15:27.803 --> 15:29.088
You want to explain that?

15:29.179 --> 15:31.044
It's a net sustained by
their own voices.

15:31.139 --> 15:33.221
Peacekeepers use them in
aerial combat training

15:33.308 --> 15:35.390
and the sound actually
cushions your fall.

15:35.477 --> 15:37.388
I'm ready.

15:45.237 --> 15:49.276
(deep reverberating hum )

16:01.336 --> 16:02.621
(hum stops)

16:09.261 --> 16:11.877
Like I said.

16:11.972 --> 16:13.758
Frell.

16:14.349 --> 16:16.135
Das...

16:25.026 --> 16:26.857
Takes the Stone.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.285
Chiana:
Drad.

16:38.373 --> 16:41.080
I gotta do that.

16:44.713 --> 16:47.045
(thunder roaring)

17:02.397 --> 17:05.355
(thunder crashing)

17:22.292 --> 17:23.202
Chiana...

17:23.293 --> 17:25.830
Aeryn:
Leave her alone, Crichton.

17:28.423 --> 17:30.004
Come on.

17:33.011 --> 17:34.797
Uh, you know what?
We're going to sober her up

17:34.888 --> 17:36.298
and get her out of here
right now.

17:36.389 --> 17:39.552
That life disc that we found on
board Moya was her brother's.

17:41.311 --> 17:42.346
Then he's dead?

17:42.437 --> 17:45.144
Yes. I think that's why she
likes it down here.

17:45.232 --> 17:47.473
I think she's trying to prove
that she's still alive.

17:47.567 --> 17:51.810
Aeryn, when I need a psych
report on Chiana, I'll
let you know.

17:51.905 --> 17:55.272
If you try to force her to
leave she will stay here just
to spite you.

17:55.367 --> 17:57.574
No, she won't.

18:09.339 --> 18:10.954
Later.

18:13.343 --> 18:15.959
And what are they going
to do with it?

18:16.054 --> 18:19.262
Soak the skin and harden
the bones.

18:19.349 --> 18:22.933
Then Das can be buried in
the Gathering Dome.

18:24.271 --> 18:26.603
Your best friend's just died.

18:27.691 --> 18:30.899
All die, nixar.

18:30.986 --> 18:32.942
But you're frightened of it.

18:33.029 --> 18:37.238
Never knowing when it's going
to happen. Should I do this?
Or do that?

18:38.368 --> 18:40.233
Fear, nixar.

18:40.870 --> 18:43.907
lt overwhelms.

18:43.999 --> 18:46.115
Not us. We live, we do
what we want.

18:46.209 --> 18:49.246
Liberated, 'cause we take
the Stone.

18:50.380 --> 18:53.417
A dead jump. The last.

18:53.508 --> 18:55.339
I know you get it.

19:01.182 --> 19:03.343
Stay with us, nixar.

19:03.435 --> 19:07.223
Celebrate the Stone.
It's the second dradest time.

19:07.314 --> 19:11.307
Chiana:
Oh? And what's the dradest?

19:25.040 --> 19:27.747
(Zhaan chanting )

19:27.834 --> 19:29.199
Shut up.

19:29.294 --> 19:31.831
(chanting continues)

19:31.921 --> 19:33.457
Shut up!

19:33.548 --> 19:35.709
(chants louder)

19:35.800 --> 19:38.667
Oh, will you please shut up!

19:38.762 --> 19:41.299
I'm doing this for your
benefit, Rygel.

19:41.389 --> 19:42.674
Oh, thank you.

19:42.766 --> 19:46.179
Now benefit me elsewhere.
I'm trying to sleep.

19:46.269 --> 19:49.227
Have you ever considered that
these items might be protected?

19:49.314 --> 19:51.726
Protected? By what?

19:51.816 --> 19:52.805
A curse.

19:52.901 --> 19:55.813
Oh, yotz. The only curse
here is you.

19:55.904 --> 20:01.570
And, anyway, if there is a
curse, which there's not,
it'll just be on me.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.241
Yes, it will.

20:05.497 --> 20:06.862
( groans )

20:06.956 --> 20:08.867
(whimpers )

20:17.842 --> 20:19.503
Aeryn:
Vyna.

20:22.389 --> 20:24.926
I'm sorry about Das.

20:25.016 --> 20:28.634
Oh, don't be, nixar.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.389
(swallowing loud )

20:30.480 --> 20:32.345
Should you be doing that?

20:35.652 --> 20:37.267
Taste?

20:45.412 --> 20:46.401
Hey.

20:47.705 --> 20:50.117
What were you talking to Chiana
about on the cliff?

20:51.709 --> 20:56.078
When narl comes,
Chiana wants to jump.

20:57.424 --> 21:00.416
I gave her my blessing.

21:07.767 --> 21:11.476
( chanting )

21:13.398 --> 21:15.480
Chiana, you got a microt?

21:15.567 --> 21:18.400
Not for you.

21:18.486 --> 21:20.147
All right, fine. You know what?

21:20.238 --> 21:26.325
You made your point and I'm
sorry that I ignored you
on the ship. Okay?

21:26.411 --> 21:30.199
Crichton, why I'm here,
it's not about you.

21:30.290 --> 21:32.952
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm not your kid.

21:33.042 --> 21:35.419
I'm not your sister and
I'm only your...

21:35.503 --> 21:38.210
your tralk in your dreams.

21:38.298 --> 21:42.132
So, please, please, go away!

21:42.218 --> 21:44.004
I'm trying to help.

21:44.095 --> 21:47.303
I don't want it and
I don't need it.

21:51.895 --> 21:54.227
I like it here.

21:54.314 --> 21:56.100
I like these people.

21:56.191 --> 22:00.059
Chiana, you realize that nobody
here has a clue.

22:00.153 --> 22:03.065
They're nothing but stoned
monkeys who jump off a cliff!

22:03.156 --> 22:07.320
Then you tell me what we're
doing on Moya that's so
frelling wonderful?

22:07.702 --> 22:09.317
Tell me that.

22:09.412 --> 22:11.653
At least they get to live
before they die, Crichton.

22:11.748 --> 22:14.239
That's what I want to do.

22:14.334 --> 22:16.871
You said to me...

22:16.961 --> 22:20.829
you said to me anytime I
want tojump ship,

22:20.924 --> 22:23.540
anytime I want to leave.

22:24.636 --> 22:26.376
Well...

22:27.639 --> 22:29.595
see ya.

22:34.354 --> 22:36.811
Feel free to jump in
here anytime.

22:36.898 --> 22:39.310
It's Chiana's choice, John.

22:44.239 --> 22:46.104
Great.

22:46.199 --> 22:48.406
That's just great, Aeryn.

22:48.493 --> 22:50.575
You know, I hope if I ever
decide to jump in front of a bus

22:50.662 --> 22:52.323
you're not the only one...

23:05.718 --> 23:08.755
Vyna told us you're
joining the clan.

23:10.139 --> 23:12.004
You really going to jump?

23:13.226 --> 23:15.012
I might.

23:15.979 --> 23:17.560
Molnon?

23:17.647 --> 23:21.606
Yo, Bob Marley, you
seen Molnon?

23:21.693 --> 23:24.230
Forget about it.
I'll find him myself.

23:25.238 --> 23:26.944
(sighs in disgust)

23:27.782 --> 23:29.443
Molnon.

23:31.619 --> 23:33.951
( heavy breathing )

23:39.586 --> 23:41.872
No, please, don't!

23:45.508 --> 23:47.874
(whimpering)

23:47.969 --> 23:49.209
Wrong person.

23:49.304 --> 23:51.420
Sorry, didn't mean to hurt you.

23:53.349 --> 23:55.635
You've been following me.

23:56.269 --> 23:57.509
Why?

23:58.062 --> 23:59.802
You old.

24:01.316 --> 24:03.557
But still you live.

24:04.444 --> 24:06.150
What's your name?

24:07.280 --> 24:08.395
Janixx.

24:11.909 --> 24:13.194
What happened to you?

24:13.286 --> 24:16.153
This happen to all of us.

24:16.247 --> 24:20.832
At 22 cycles, if we do not
take the Stone.

24:20.918 --> 24:25.036
Gardas and nixars here
don't like seeing this,

24:25.131 --> 24:27.122
SO WE go away.

24:27.216 --> 24:31.084
Hide. Make ourself lost.

24:31.179 --> 24:33.795
Lost? You're one of the
Lost People?

24:36.309 --> 24:39.096
Das said he knew why
this happened.

24:39.187 --> 24:42.099
He said cliff has answer.

24:42.190 --> 24:43.771
What are you talking about?

24:43.858 --> 24:47.146
I'm lost. Must stay lost.

25:03.795 --> 25:06.958
Crichton:
You must be pushing 22
cycles, huh, sport?

25:07.048 --> 25:09.084
I'd say the end is
near for you,

25:09.175 --> 25:11.666
whether you take the
Stone or not.

25:13.388 --> 25:15.800
You've been talking to
the Lost People.

25:15.890 --> 25:17.221
( chuckles )

25:17.308 --> 25:18.684
You true smart.

25:18.768 --> 25:22.886
Yeah, well, it's easy to jump
when you know you're
going to die.

25:22.980 --> 25:26.063
Chiana's not going to die.

25:26.150 --> 25:28.232
Why drag her into this?

25:30.279 --> 25:32.065
See this?

25:32.782 --> 25:35.239
Three lobes gets you high.

25:35.326 --> 25:37.112
One gets you dead.

25:37.203 --> 25:39.364
Never know which one.

25:40.748 --> 25:43.615
Are we having a failure to
communicate here?

25:46.003 --> 25:50.167
I'm not going to talk
until you taste.

26:20.788 --> 26:22.449
Ooh, man.

26:27.962 --> 26:29.827
( soft chuckles )

26:29.922 --> 26:33.130
Now since you taste, I talk.

26:33.217 --> 26:37.551
Only thing worth having is
a narl, and I want one.

26:37.638 --> 26:41.130
And I'm scared that if next I
take the Stone, it claims me.

26:41.225 --> 26:45.343
So Chiana takes my place.
She takes the Stone.

26:46.856 --> 26:48.596
Son of a bitch!

26:49.192 --> 26:50.557
You've had your time.

26:50.651 --> 26:53.779
You leave Chiana out
of this, just...

26:53.863 --> 26:56.821
She wants to fly.

26:56.908 --> 26:58.944
| tell you truth.

27:00.286 --> 27:05.531
And I'm going to tell her...
truth.

27:07.210 --> 27:09.292
( slowly ):
Truth.

27:09.378 --> 27:12.666
( blurred speech ):
Only if you remember.

27:12.757 --> 27:14.372
You won't remember.

27:14.467 --> 27:16.253
I'm going to remember.

27:16.969 --> 27:18.880
(laughing)

27:21.390 --> 27:22.926
(three stooges laugh )

27:26.354 --> 27:28.345
( screaming )

27:37.448 --> 27:38.984
Aeryn:
Crichton!

27:42.078 --> 27:43.614
Crichton...

27:43.704 --> 27:44.693
Whoa!

27:47.458 --> 27:48.322
Here...

27:48.417 --> 27:49.827
What happened to you?

27:49.919 --> 27:54.208
I had a pissing contest
with Molnon.

27:54.298 --> 27:55.959
I won. I think.

27:56.050 --> 27:57.335
It doesn't look like it.

27:57.426 --> 27:59.417
Yeah. Yeah, well...

27:59.512 --> 28:01.468
I got some information.

28:01.556 --> 28:02.966
There's more...

28:03.057 --> 28:04.172
( both grunting )

28:04.267 --> 28:06.929
l, uh...

28:07.019 --> 28:12.434
l, uh... I think I convinced
him to get Chiana not to jump.

28:12.525 --> 28:14.356
Aeryn:
That's good. That's great.

28:14.443 --> 28:15.853
Crichton:
Listen...

28:15.945 --> 28:19.654
I need you to go back to
the Transport pod.

28:19.740 --> 28:22.152
Take this tissue sample.
I got it from the Lost People.

28:22.243 --> 28:25.906
Scan it up to Zhaan.
See if we can find out what...

28:25.997 --> 28:28.864
what's killing these kids.

28:28.958 --> 28:30.664
Where are you going?

28:30.751 --> 28:31.957
To see if this...

28:32.044 --> 28:33.375
(groaning)

28:33.462 --> 28:36.204
Excedrin headache was worth it.

28:47.518 --> 28:48.928
Crichton!

28:49.020 --> 28:50.180
Whoa, whoa...

28:51.147 --> 28:54.014
notso”.soloud.

28:54.108 --> 28:57.646
Those morna, they have a real
kick to them, don't they?

28:58.654 --> 29:00.110
Mmm...

29:00.197 --> 29:01.186
Hey, um...

29:01.282 --> 29:04.115
Molnon told me what
you talked about.

29:05.703 --> 29:07.159
He did?

29:07.246 --> 29:09.862
That's fantastic.

29:09.957 --> 29:11.493
That is fanta...

29:11.584 --> 29:14.417
let us get the hell
out of here then.

29:14.503 --> 29:15.959
Oh, no, I'm not leaving.

29:16.047 --> 29:17.253
l'm jumping.

29:19.175 --> 29:21.336
What?

29:21.427 --> 29:23.759
Come on, don tfrell with me.
You understand.

29:24.805 --> 29:30.141
Chiana, I know that you like
Molnon.

29:30.227 --> 29:32.092
But he is using you.

29:32.188 --> 29:36.807
He only wants you here so
you'll do the jump and
he won't have to.

29:36.901 --> 29:38.482
No, he's not.

29:38.569 --> 29:41.231
I want to jump.

29:41.322 --> 29:43.153
l have to.

29:46.869 --> 29:47.984
Okay.

29:48.079 --> 29:49.910
Okay.
-Okay.

29:50.539 --> 29:51.870
You want to jump?

29:51.958 --> 29:53.539
Yeah.

29:54.585 --> 29:58.919
But whatever you want,

29:59.006 --> 30:02.544
you cannot want to die.

30:04.720 --> 30:07.928
Well, maybe one day...

30:10.142 --> 30:12.224
you'll understand.

30:16.232 --> 30:17.312
(gasping)

30:30.121 --> 30:31.361
You frelling...

30:31.455 --> 30:33.741
you frelling khan.

30:33.833 --> 30:35.243
You gotta to let me...

30:35.334 --> 30:38.542
you gotta to let me fly.

30:38.629 --> 30:40.415
You gotta to let me fly.

30:41.757 --> 30:44.043
Aeryn:
What... what are you doing?

30:44.135 --> 30:46.251
I think it's pretty
self-explanatory.

30:46.345 --> 30:48.552
You're not going anywhere.
-Yes, I am.

30:48.639 --> 30:51.255
No, you re not.
-She wants tojump.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.181
She wants to kill herself.

30:53.269 --> 30:54.304
You can't take her like this.

30:54.395 --> 30:55.680
Yes, I can!
-No, you can't!

30:55.771 --> 30:57.272
lc... Aeryn!

30:57.356 --> 30:59.017
What the hell is wrong
with you?

30:59.108 --> 31:01.690
You are the pin-up girl
for frontal assault.

31:01.777 --> 31:04.268
You should be dragging her back
to the ship yourself.

31:04.363 --> 31:06.319
Crichton, just listen to me,
will you?

31:06.407 --> 31:10.195
If Chiana really wants to,
she's going to find a way
to kill herself,

31:10.286 --> 31:12.151
and maybe not here, or now.

31:12.246 --> 31:14.578
So you have to let her work
through this on her own.

31:14.665 --> 31:17.452
You cannot take her back
to Moya like this.

31:42.276 --> 31:45.109
When did you get so insightful?

31:45.196 --> 31:47.232
I understand loss.

31:47.615 --> 31:49.401
SodoL

31:54.830 --> 31:58.197
Did you scan the tissue
samples up to Zhaan?

31:58.292 --> 32:00.032
Aeryn:
Yes, I did.

32:01.170 --> 32:02.501
Thank you.

32:04.215 --> 32:07.207
Well, let's get her on
the dog and bone.

32:09.303 --> 32:11.919
Whatever that means, Crichton.

32:16.727 --> 32:20.265
Rygel:
Now this is what a Dominar's
chamber should look like.

32:20.356 --> 32:25.396
Hung with the blood-stained
trophies from my conquests.

32:40.918 --> 32:42.408
( Rygel screaming )

32:50.261 --> 32:53.298
This cannot be real.

32:54.682 --> 32:59.267
Yes, I know what's happening.

33:02.189 --> 33:05.932
Talk to me, Zhaan.
What have you got?

33:06.026 --> 33:10.690
John, the readings from the
tissue samples do indicate
long-term radiation exposure.

33:10.781 --> 33:13.158
Yeah, I thought they might.

33:13.242 --> 33:17.531
But according to your readings,
the radiation level is
only 76 trads.

33:17.621 --> 33:18.906
Is that high or low?

33:18.998 --> 33:20.704
Low, I would have thought.

33:20.791 --> 33:24.579
Huh. Is that too low to
make somebody sick?

33:24.670 --> 33:26.206
D'Argo:
Yes.

33:26.297 --> 33:28.162
But Pilot thinks that the cliff
chamber you're describing

33:28.257 --> 33:31.090
may be acting as an amplifier
which would increase
the exposure.

33:31.177 --> 33:35.341
Aeryn:
I imagine that would be the
reason why they all die at twenty two cycles.

33:35.431 --> 33:37.262
I believe it would.

33:37.349 --> 33:39.886
Crichton:
Maybe Das figured that out.

33:39.977 --> 33:43.219
You know, maybe he knew if the
clans moved out of the caves,

33:43.314 --> 33:45.771
they'd stop dying so young.

33:45.858 --> 33:49.601
They wouldn't have a reason
to take the Stone.

33:50.779 --> 33:52.110
Thanks, guys.

33:52.198 --> 33:54.610
We'll all be back up real soon.

33:55.534 --> 33:58.025
Goddess be with you, John.

33:59.955 --> 34:01.661
Curse my mivonks.

34:01.749 --> 34:04.912
I know what you're up to and
it's not going to work.

34:05.002 --> 34:06.242
What are you talking about?

34:06.337 --> 34:09.249
Rygel:
It's you that's making
everything in my chamber cursed.

34:09.340 --> 34:13.208
But I'm not returning any of
it, no matter what you do.

34:13.302 --> 34:15.258
I'm keeping it all,
you hear me?

34:15.346 --> 34:17.052
Everything!

34:19.516 --> 34:22.883
(Vyna screaming)

34:26.899 --> 34:29.106
Do you need help?
Can I get someone for you?

34:29.193 --> 34:30.854
Vyna:
No, don t touch me!

34:30.945 --> 34:34.904
We give birth alone, as our
clans prepare the Gathering.

34:34.990 --> 34:37.106
Yes, and somebody has to do the
bungee without the rope,

34:37.201 --> 34:39.408
except this time it's our
friend jumping.

34:39.495 --> 34:42.111
Ah, its too late, garda!

34:42.206 --> 34:43.161
Now go!

34:43.249 --> 34:45.285
( screaming )
Leave!

34:45.376 --> 34:49.039
Listen, Vyna, we know why you
all die young here.

34:49.129 --> 34:50.710
Crichton:
It's radiation.

34:50.798 --> 34:52.459
We think that Das knew it, too.

34:52.549 --> 34:55.040
He knew there was a way
to stop the jumps.

34:55.135 --> 34:58.343
Das? Oh, my poor Das.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.842
Aeryn:
Vyna, if you move out of these
caves and up to the surface,

35:00.933 --> 35:04.767
you can all live longer lives.
Your child can, too.

35:04.853 --> 35:06.559
Crichton:
We need you to talk
to the clans.

35:06.647 --> 35:08.638
If they hear it from you,
they'll believe it.

35:08.732 --> 35:10.108
No one ever has to jump again.

35:10.192 --> 35:12.103
( screaming )

35:14.071 --> 35:17.609
Molnon didn't make
Das jump, garda.

35:17.700 --> 35:20.112
The rules of the clan did.

35:20.744 --> 35:22.154
Das understood.

35:22.246 --> 35:25.113
In the final, Das scoped
that truth.

35:25.207 --> 35:26.367
You let him die?

35:27.835 --> 35:29.996
He took the Stone!

35:30.087 --> 35:32.624
He'll live forever now.

35:33.257 --> 35:35.293
( screaming )

35:35.384 --> 35:38.251
Look at you. You're old.

35:39.346 --> 35:41.462
You're worn out!

35:42.099 --> 35:43.384
Now, go!

35:43.475 --> 35:47.218
Aaghh, just go!

35:47.313 --> 35:49.429
(Vyna continues screaming )

35:49.523 --> 35:51.639
(sobbing)

36:00.576 --> 36:02.988
Chiana, don't.

36:14.006 --> 36:17.419
Listen to me, all of you.

36:19.303 --> 36:21.294
There's radiation in the rocks.

36:21.388 --> 36:24.255
That's what's killing the
Lost People. That's what's
killing all of you.

36:24.350 --> 36:26.181
( chuckles )

36:26.268 --> 36:28.429
Garda doesn't understand.

36:28.520 --> 36:30.636
He's old!

36:30.731 --> 36:32.312
Crichton:
That's right.

36:32.399 --> 36:34.310
I'm old.

36:34.401 --> 36:36.642
And you can be old
just like me.

36:36.737 --> 36:39.274
( Molnon chuckles)

36:39.365 --> 36:41.321
I don't want to be
ancient, garda.

36:41.408 --> 36:45.242
Move to the surface.
Live as long as you can.

36:45.329 --> 36:48.196
The surface belongs to the
Royals and their tombs.

36:48.290 --> 36:50.281
( hisses )

36:52.169 --> 36:54.125
You think that Janixx
has it bad?

36:54.213 --> 36:56.169
Wait till you see what this
does to your face.

36:56.256 --> 36:58.998
Crichton, get the frell out of
here! This is about me.

36:59.093 --> 37:03.632
Chiana, shut up and don't
move another step!

37:07.601 --> 37:09.102
Ready, boy?

37:09.186 --> 37:11.518
There's your Stone.

37:11.605 --> 37:13.220
What do you say?

37:13.315 --> 37:15.397
Want to take it together?

37:16.276 --> 37:19.939
Tick, tick, tick.

37:20.656 --> 37:22.772
Time's running out.

37:22.866 --> 37:25.528
Garda doesn't understand.

37:25.619 --> 37:27.155
We want the Stone.

37:27.246 --> 37:28.577
( hisses )

37:28.664 --> 37:29.779
(all hiss)

37:29.873 --> 37:32.330
Oh, you think?

37:32.418 --> 37:34.909
Let the clans decide.

37:35.462 --> 37:38.329
Let the clans vote!

37:38.424 --> 37:41.040
Molnon:
Clans will vote.

37:41.135 --> 37:42.545
( Molnon chuckles)

37:43.303 --> 37:46.511
What they scope, I'll follow.

37:57.401 --> 37:59.517
You satisfied?

37:59.611 --> 38:01.067
Chiana, I'm just trying...

38:01.155 --> 38:03.191
You can't help me.

38:10.873 --> 38:12.784
Rygel:
They're just trying to scare me.

38:12.875 --> 38:14.490
Get me to cut them in.

38:14.585 --> 38:17.292
Well, they can forget
about that.

38:17.379 --> 38:18.334
It's not going to work.

38:18.422 --> 38:19.582
(metallic clank)

38:19.673 --> 38:21.004
Who's there?

38:21.091 --> 38:22.752
(chuckles nervously)

38:25.512 --> 38:29.471
Yotz! There's nothing wrong
with any of this. Nothing!

38:29.558 --> 38:30.764
You hear that?

38:33.145 --> 38:35.386
You can't scare me!

38:36.106 --> 38:37.642
(gasps )

38:39.443 --> 38:41.229
All right.

38:41.320 --> 38:43.276
All right, I'll take it back.

38:43.363 --> 38:45.319
All of it. I promise.

38:45.407 --> 38:47.363
Just make it stop.

38:47.451 --> 38:49.112
( screams )

38:49.870 --> 38:54.204
Pilot, is the Transport fueled?

38:58.587 --> 39:00.703
Crichton:
Yo, Molnon.

39:02.633 --> 39:04.248
How'd the vote go?

39:04.343 --> 39:06.959
You got no idea, garda.

39:07.054 --> 39:10.592
No idea. All the clans,
every one, voted to stay.

39:10.682 --> 39:12.263
To keepjumping.

39:12.351 --> 39:13.431
What?

39:13.519 --> 39:15.635
They didn't believe the
radiation was killing them?

39:15.729 --> 39:20.223
No, they don't believe.
They know what's killing them.

39:20.317 --> 39:23.024
l'm rechanting the Gathering.
They want the Stone.

39:23.111 --> 39:25.102
I've already told Chiana.

39:25.197 --> 39:27.108
I've given her a head start.

39:27.199 --> 39:29.155
It's going to be drad.

39:29.243 --> 39:31.359
Hey, Molnon.

39:31.453 --> 39:34.195
Please, just wait. Just...

39:40.921 --> 39:43.879
Why does it always
end in tears?

39:50.389 --> 39:52.220
(thunder crashes)

39:52.307 --> 39:54.468
Hey, old man.

39:56.395 --> 39:58.727
Chiana...
-Don't come any closer.

40:00.023 --> 40:02.014
I won't.

40:02.109 --> 40:04.145
Have the clans voted?

40:05.279 --> 40:07.235
Yeah.

40:07.322 --> 40:09.187
And they're going to
stop jumping?

40:09.283 --> 40:11.399
No.

40:12.369 --> 40:15.031
They voted to keep jumping.

40:15.956 --> 40:18.072
They want to die.

40:19.376 --> 40:22.459
| just can't believe that
you want to die.

40:30.304 --> 40:33.467
Never had any courage.

40:33.557 --> 40:38.893
As a kid, Nerri gave me
everything. ljust...
ljust followed him.

40:41.607 --> 40:44.223
You've shown me courage
plenty of times.

40:46.778 --> 40:49.690
I got to see if I can
do this, Crichton.

40:52.326 --> 40:53.907
And if you die?

41:09.926 --> 41:13.965
(humming single note)

41:31.239 --> 41:32.775
(humming ceases)

41:37.537 --> 41:40.153
Chiana!

41:40.248 --> 41:42.375
You did it!

41:42.459 --> 41:45.622
Woo-hoo-hool

41:45.712 --> 41:47.919
I did it?

41:48.006 --> 41:49.587
Wool

41:49.675 --> 41:53.213
(both laughing)

41:56.348 --> 41:58.259
I did it!

42:06.066 --> 42:07.181
(thunder crashing)

42:07.275 --> 42:10.233
It's been three arns, John.

42:10.320 --> 42:13.107
Just give it a few more
microts, okay?

42:31.383 --> 42:33.339
Lately...

42:33.427 --> 42:35.088
do I seem...

42:35.178 --> 42:37.635
a little crazy to you?

42:37.723 --> 42:39.554
What do you mean, "lately"?

42:41.017 --> 42:45.602
Well, late one of
Molnon's mushrooms.

42:45.689 --> 42:48.396
One in four gets you dead.

42:48.483 --> 42:50.940
Was that supposed to get Chiana
out of here more quickly, John?

42:51.027 --> 42:52.813
You eating a mushroom?

42:56.825 --> 42:59.191
( loud grunt)
( metallic clattering )

43:01.413 --> 43:04.496
Rygel, we're out of here in 90
microts with or without you.

43:04.583 --> 43:08.041
I'm going as fast as I can.

43:29.191 --> 43:30.852
Hey, old man.

43:31.818 --> 43:34.195
Hey, little girl.

43:34.863 --> 43:36.319
You okay?

43:39.868 --> 43:41.859
Yeah.

43:46.208 --> 43:48.790
You know...

43:48.877 --> 43:51.835
Molnon was right about
one thing.

43:54.049 --> 43:57.416
The jump was incredible.

44:00.472 --> 44:02.554
You should have tried it.

44:05.268 --> 44:09.637
Nah, I'm too old.

44:32.504 --> 44:34.870
It's time to go.

44:52.983 --> 44:55.725
Chiana:
Let's get out of this
dead place.

45:00.115 --> 45:01.150
( hisses )

45:01.241 --> 45:02.356
( hisses )
