00:02.152 --> 00:04.245
So I'm not saying
that everything is great.

00:04.421 --> 00:07.356
But I promise you,
everything gets better.

00:08.591 --> 00:10.354
Anyway, look, thank you...

00:10.627 --> 00:11.924
...for letting me share tonight.

00:12.095 --> 00:14.029
If you get nothing else
out of my qualification...

00:14.197 --> 00:19.066
...just remember this: don't drink,
even if your ass is falling off.

00:23.540 --> 00:29.570
God, grant me the serenity
to accept the things I cannot change...

00:29.746 --> 00:32.408
...courage to change
the things I can...

00:32.582 --> 00:34.812
...and wisdom to know the difference.

00:34.984 --> 00:36.212
Amen.

00:36.386 --> 00:39.719
Keep coming back.
It works if you work it.

00:49.999 --> 00:52.058
Hey, that was a, uh...

00:53.136 --> 00:55.127
- What do you call it? It's a...
- Oh, oh.

00:55.305 --> 00:56.932
- Qualification.
- Right.

00:57.107 --> 00:59.075
Yeah, thanks, kid.
I'm glad you liked it.

00:59.642 --> 01:01.234
You been in the program a while?

01:01.411 --> 01:04.608
A little over 14 years now.
How about you?

01:04.781 --> 01:07.306
Yeah, I just... I was...

01:07.484 --> 01:10.510
I was wondering how all this works.

01:11.287 --> 01:13.812
This must be your first meeting, huh?

01:14.991 --> 01:17.619
I don't know.
I just feel like I'm in such a deep hole.

01:17.794 --> 01:19.694
I don't know how to dig myself out.

01:19.863 --> 01:23.128
- Am I taking up too much of your time?
- No. Not at all. Keep going.

01:23.299 --> 01:27.360
All right. After my wife divorced me,
she, like, turned my parents against me.

01:27.537 --> 01:30.802
They think I've blown it, you know,
losing my marriage and my career.

01:30.974 --> 01:35.377
But, um... I don't know. I mean, never,
ever, ever drinking again? I...

01:35.545 --> 01:37.172
All right. Listen, kid.

01:37.347 --> 01:39.042
You don't think about it that way.

01:39.249 --> 01:43.549
You just think, " I'm not gonna have
a drink today." That's it.

01:47.290 --> 01:49.815
Hey, why don't we go
across the street...

01:49.993 --> 01:53.053
...I'll buy you a cup of coffee
and we'll keep talking?

01:53.229 --> 01:55.288
Um, no.

01:55.799 --> 01:57.027
No, I, um...

01:57.200 --> 01:59.828
Thank you for the offer, but I just...

02:00.703 --> 02:02.694
I don't know if I can do this yet.

02:02.872 --> 02:03.964
- Sorry.
- Sure.

02:07.544 --> 02:12.004
Nice meeting you. And, uh, if you change
your mind, I'm here next week.

02:13.082 --> 02:15.676
- I'm really sorry.
- Not a problem.

02:16.886 --> 02:18.649
Hey.

02:19.155 --> 02:20.486
Keep coming back.

04:33.156 --> 04:36.523
Captain Raydor. It's Lieutenant Flynn.

04:36.693 --> 04:37.785
Yeah.

04:37.961 --> 04:40.156
This is your lucky day.

04:48.338 --> 04:52.468
Lieutenant, sit down. You've lost more
blood than you know. You're in shock.

04:52.642 --> 04:54.974
I'm not going anywhere
until I give my statement.

04:55.144 --> 04:56.907
Let them do their job, lieutenant.

04:57.080 --> 05:00.015
- Yeah, right after I do mine.
- Okay, hurry up.

05:00.183 --> 05:02.151
He used this. My attacker.

05:02.318 --> 05:04.752
Was white, six feet. Asshole.

05:04.954 --> 05:07.514
I discharged my weapon.
So you're gonna want my gun.

05:09.058 --> 05:10.150
Here. Take it.

05:10.326 --> 05:12.385
There's one in the chamber.
Six in the mag.

05:12.562 --> 05:15.326
And two in that son of a bitch.

05:17.667 --> 05:20.067
I double tapped,
so he couldn't have gone far.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.568
He ran off over...

05:23.439 --> 05:25.839
- Whoa...
- Okay.

05:28.878 --> 05:30.675
He better wake up.

05:33.483 --> 05:35.075
Need that. Thank you.

05:51.634 --> 05:53.465
This is Captain Sharon Raydor.

05:53.636 --> 05:56.366
Put out a hospital alert
for Southern California.

06:07.250 --> 06:08.308
So there is a hell.

06:09.452 --> 06:11.920
You're not there yet, lieutenant.

06:13.656 --> 06:16.318
- It's the only one they had in the shop.
- It's okay.

06:16.526 --> 06:19.222
- Doesn't matter because I'm not staying.
- Yes, you are.

06:19.395 --> 06:22.091
You've got 30 stitches
in your side alone.

06:22.265 --> 06:24.256
Lay back. Are you comfortable?

06:24.434 --> 06:25.594
Yeah, I'm fine, chief.

06:25.768 --> 06:27.929
Good, because I've got
some questions for you.

06:28.104 --> 06:30.800
- Like who would wanna kill me?
- Lots of people, I'm sure.

06:30.973 --> 06:33.567
- But who would go to the trouble?
- I have no idea.

06:33.743 --> 06:35.643
You're positive
you didn't know the guy?

06:35.812 --> 06:38.440
I've never seen him before in my life.

06:38.614 --> 06:44.246
I was leaving an AA meeting
when this young man, around 30...

06:44.420 --> 06:45.614
...came up to talk to me.

06:45.788 --> 06:47.585
I mean, definitely not the attacker.

06:47.757 --> 06:51.193
Now, I don't... I didn't think
anything of it at the time...

06:51.360 --> 06:55.524
...but, uh, this newbie, he hung out
until everyone else was gone.

06:55.698 --> 06:59.293
Okay. Lieutenant, I'm gonna need
to take a peek at the AA logbook...

06:59.469 --> 07:02.461
...or sign-in sheet...
- There is no sign-in sheet.

07:02.638 --> 07:04.265
It's anonymous.

07:04.440 --> 07:07.102
Hasn't your husband told you
about how AA works?

07:07.276 --> 07:09.972
All right, then.
So the guy that was waiting for you...

07:10.146 --> 07:13.377
...did you at least get his first name?
- No. No, I didn't.

07:13.583 --> 07:17.110
I watched him walk out.
Then I went out to my car and then...

07:17.286 --> 07:19.846
- Oh, damn. Look at me.
- You should see the other guy.

07:22.125 --> 07:24.787
Captain Raydor. Have you found
Lt. Flynn's assailant?

07:24.961 --> 07:26.792
The hospital alert
didn't show anybody.

07:26.963 --> 07:29.523
But a crime broadcast
found a white male...

07:29.699 --> 07:32.395
...shot in the chest,
left by the road in San Bernardino.

07:32.602 --> 07:34.627
We've ID'd him as Bobby Harris.

07:34.804 --> 07:36.169
Never heard of him.

07:36.339 --> 07:39.968
All right, misdemeanor car theft,
out on probation three days ago.

07:40.143 --> 07:43.203
I had a detective in San Bernardino
e-mail me his photo.

07:45.047 --> 07:46.742
Is this the man who attacked you?

07:46.916 --> 07:50.977
I should mention
that if you positively ID the victim...

07:51.154 --> 07:53.418
...then this case becomes mine
right now.

07:53.623 --> 07:56.820
On the other hand,
if you don't recognize this man...

07:56.993 --> 08:00.053
...then this case will be investigated
by Major Crimes.

08:00.229 --> 08:06.134
So bearing all of that in mind,
is this the man who tried to kill you?

08:11.007 --> 08:12.065
It is hard to say.

08:12.241 --> 08:14.368
It all happened so fast.

08:15.144 --> 08:16.202
Very good.

08:16.846 --> 08:18.677
Uh, you will be needing this.

08:18.848 --> 08:21.510
This is the knife from the crime scene.

08:21.684 --> 08:23.242
Good luck, chief.

08:23.419 --> 08:26.183
Thank you so much, Captain Raydor.

08:28.090 --> 08:32.049
That's definitely the guy. That gash
on his face was from the wiper blade I...

08:32.227 --> 08:34.457
No, no, no.
You've never seen that man before.

08:34.664 --> 08:36.597
Yes, I have, chief. That's the guy.

08:36.765 --> 08:40.065
I don't want you to ID anybody
until you're in a better state of mind.

08:40.236 --> 08:42.966
Wait until Capt. Raydor comes back
with the results from Ballistics...

08:43.172 --> 08:44.366
...then you can ID him.

08:44.974 --> 08:46.373
Hey, lieutenant.

08:46.542 --> 08:47.975
Oh, hey, David.

08:48.177 --> 08:51.271
- Oh, you don't look too bad.
- Heh.

08:51.814 --> 08:56.444
Chief, I just ran into Captain Raydor out
in the hallway and she said hello to me.

08:58.321 --> 08:59.982
She's up to something.

09:00.189 --> 09:01.952
Is there any, uh, leads on your attacker?

09:02.124 --> 09:03.216
- No.
- Yes.

09:03.392 --> 09:07.726
Well, now that we've got that settled,
I'm going to San Bernardino...

09:07.897 --> 09:09.797
...to search Dead Bobby Harris' home.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.058
Come on, Gabriel.

09:11.234 --> 09:13.395
- I'll fill you in on the way.
- Feel better.

09:17.940 --> 09:19.635
Well...

09:20.743 --> 09:22.404
...I'm leaving too.

09:22.578 --> 09:23.738
You take care. And, um...

09:24.480 --> 09:26.948
...keep your hands off the nurses.

09:34.490 --> 09:36.082
Chief?

09:37.426 --> 09:40.259
Dead Bobby Harris was living
above his mother's garage.

09:40.429 --> 09:42.294
Mom didn't want him
under the same roof.

09:42.465 --> 09:45.628
He didn't have a car either. We checked
his mom's SUV, no blood.

09:45.801 --> 09:48.099
So how he got to San Bernardino,
we don't know.

09:48.271 --> 09:51.035
Maybe the guy who was stalling
Lt. Flynn at his meeting...

09:51.240 --> 09:55.199
...picked up Bobby after he was shot
and dumped the body in San Bernardino.

09:55.378 --> 10:00.611
- What's in the bag?
- Oh, uh, $37,500. Cash.

10:00.783 --> 10:03.479
We found this in the closet
in Bob's apartment.

10:03.653 --> 10:07.749
This guy didn't need to rob Flynn.
He was lying in wait, chief.

10:09.759 --> 10:13.058
Tao. Tao, I already counted this.

10:13.262 --> 10:15.890
- You heard Gabriel. There's 37...
- I'm not counting it.

10:16.065 --> 10:18.124
- Then what?
- Due to counterfeiting...

10:18.301 --> 10:21.464
...our currency got a series of facelifts
over the past 12 years.

10:21.637 --> 10:24.663
All these bills are from the old design
from before 1998.

10:24.840 --> 10:28.469
And when you take into account
the Secretary of Treasury signatures...

10:28.644 --> 10:30.669
...all this cash might even be earlier.

10:31.514 --> 10:34.642
See? This is a stack
of Nicholas F. Brady's.

10:34.817 --> 10:37.342
Uh, 1988 to 1993.

10:37.753 --> 10:39.653
Ohh.

10:39.822 --> 10:43.053
A Lloyd Bentsen. Very rare.

10:43.225 --> 10:47.992
So an ex-con, three days out of jail,
with a bag of cash from the 1990s.

10:48.731 --> 10:53.361
- Someone paid this guy to kill Lt. Flynn.
- I'm in violent agreement.

11:09.385 --> 11:11.012
What?

11:11.420 --> 11:14.856
I was just thinking that maybe
it'd be a good idea...

11:15.024 --> 11:17.857
...for me to come with you
to some of your AA meetings.

11:18.027 --> 11:19.892
Really.

11:20.563 --> 11:23.760
You wanna spend time getting to know
that part of my life?

11:23.933 --> 11:26.128
I do. I do.

11:26.302 --> 11:30.796
And I had a sketch artist sit down
with Andy last night.

11:31.006 --> 11:33.941
- Mm-hm.
- And they came up with a composite...

11:34.110 --> 11:38.376
...of the man that he was talking to
after his AA meeting.

11:38.547 --> 11:42.142
- I thought, you know, perfect timing.
- This has nothing to do with me...

11:42.385 --> 11:45.218
...and everything to do with work.
- Why can't it be both?

11:45.388 --> 11:46.821
I got a better idea.

11:47.022 --> 11:51.459
If you're honestly, truthfully interested
in spending more free time with me...

11:51.627 --> 11:55.393
- I am. That was the whole point of...
- Listen. Listen. Shh. One second. Listen.

11:57.400 --> 11:58.958
As a liaison to the L.A.P. D...

11:59.135 --> 12:01.831
...I could pass on
some highly classified info to you.

12:02.271 --> 12:04.296
- Mm-hm.
- But you'd have to get in bed with me...

12:04.473 --> 12:06.168
...for five minutes to hear it.

12:06.342 --> 12:09.505
Five minutes? Well, this clearly
isn't gonna be about me.

12:09.678 --> 12:12.340
Oh, but that's how good
the information is.

12:12.515 --> 12:14.244
Uh-huh.

12:16.285 --> 12:18.480
But, you know...

12:19.155 --> 12:21.783
...I'm not supposed to talk.

12:27.630 --> 12:30.064
Okay, you broke me. Heh.

12:30.266 --> 12:32.894
- Now that Tommy Delk...
- Uh-huh.

12:33.068 --> 12:34.968
...has been sworn in
as the new chief...

12:35.137 --> 12:39.301
...people are telling me,
they're gonna offer you...

12:39.475 --> 12:40.942
...Pope's job.

12:47.283 --> 12:50.184
That's why Captain Raydor
let me go first last night.

12:50.352 --> 12:54.516
You could be her boss. She's doing
some preemptive ass-kissing.

12:54.690 --> 12:57.022
I know you don't like Will,
but he's my friend.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.184
I can never take his job
away from him.

12:59.361 --> 13:02.524
- You're not taking it. You've earned it...
- It's horrible news.

13:02.698 --> 13:05.292
Do you not think Will Pope
would've walked over you...

13:05.468 --> 13:07.299
...if it meant he could've been chief?

13:14.043 --> 13:16.807
Hey, you promised me five minutes.

13:16.979 --> 13:18.640
Well, I didn't say when.

13:18.814 --> 13:20.372
Did I?

13:25.888 --> 13:30.416
I followed the money, double-checked it.
All old paper, 1988 to 1995.

13:30.626 --> 13:33.390
So I pulled all of Flynn's convictions
during those years.

13:33.562 --> 13:34.756
Slide.

13:34.930 --> 13:37.524
And since Dead Bob got out of jail
three days ago...

13:37.700 --> 13:40.692
...we cross-referenced everyone else
coming through the system.

13:40.870 --> 13:43.703
Maybe someone on the inside
sent Bob on a mission.

13:43.873 --> 13:45.272
Slide.

13:45.908 --> 13:49.844
Martin Lawson, murdered his mother.
He was convicted in June of '94.

13:50.012 --> 13:51.604
He came at Flynn in court...

13:51.780 --> 13:55.216
...swore his brothers would get Flynn
for calling his mama ugly.

13:55.384 --> 13:58.285
That's what got him talking.
Flynn is the guy that broke him.

13:58.454 --> 14:00.115
By the way, his mother was ugly.

14:00.289 --> 14:03.019
What are you doing here?
You've got over 30 stitches.

14:03.192 --> 14:06.059
Look, if you're trying to find somebody
connected to me...

14:06.228 --> 14:10.130
...don't you think you have a better
chance identifying them with my help?

14:10.299 --> 14:13.791
Chief, don't worry.
He won't do much. Like usual.

14:13.969 --> 14:17.302
It's just until we make the guy
and then Flynn is going home.

14:17.473 --> 14:21.068
Lieutenant Flynn, you can stay.
As soon as you make the ID, you leave.

14:21.243 --> 14:23.370
Slide. Slide.

14:28.350 --> 14:31.251
Whoa, whoa. Back that thing up. There.

14:31.787 --> 14:33.550
That's Rick Zuman.

14:33.722 --> 14:36.555
Yeah. He dealt coke
and laundered money in the 90's.

14:36.725 --> 14:41.059
He offed two of his business partners.
I got his bookkeeper to flip on his alibi.

14:41.230 --> 14:42.492
What was his m. o?

14:42.698 --> 14:45.292
Oh, well, Ricky boy would,
uh, find a mark...

14:45.467 --> 14:48.766
...get some front money from them
for a big cocaine buy...

14:48.938 --> 14:52.840
...and promise to double their investment
by selling it.

14:53.008 --> 14:55.499
When his partners came
looking for their share...

14:55.711 --> 14:57.838
...he'd make sure they died
of an overdose.

14:58.013 --> 14:59.412
The feds had an informant.

14:59.582 --> 15:03.018
Gave him $400,000 in marked bills
to make a deal with Rick.

15:03.218 --> 15:04.981
Yeah, but the informant went missing.

15:05.154 --> 15:07.019
They never found the body
or the cash.

15:07.222 --> 15:09.782
Rick went to jail in '96.

15:09.959 --> 15:11.927
This money's from '95 and before.

15:12.094 --> 15:14.255
Maybe this is some of the FBI cash.

15:14.430 --> 15:16.864
How did Zuman
get his conviction overturned?

15:17.032 --> 15:20.695
It's gotta be some technicality
because this creep's as guilty as sin.

15:20.869 --> 15:24.805
Still, on appeal, he would have been
in county lockup waiting for his retrial.

15:24.974 --> 15:28.432
Which means that Zuman and Dead Bob
were there at the same time.

15:28.877 --> 15:32.608
Lieutenant Provenza, would you please
get Rick Zuman's jail movement records?

15:32.781 --> 15:35.113
I wanna find out who his friends
might have been.

15:35.284 --> 15:38.981
Maybe one of them was Dead Bob or the
young man Flynn met at his AA meeting.

15:39.888 --> 15:42.379
Lieutenant Flynn, did Rick have
any special reason...

15:42.558 --> 15:44.355
...to hate you?
- I don't know.

15:44.526 --> 15:46.824
Did you assault, threaten
or irritate him in any way?

15:46.996 --> 15:49.556
Uh, well, when we convicted Rick...

15:49.765 --> 15:53.064
...I told him that I knew that he'd killed
that FBI informant...

15:53.268 --> 15:56.704
...and that I was going
to dedicate my life to proving it.

15:56.905 --> 15:58.395
And then what did you do?

15:58.574 --> 16:00.872
I don't know.
Something else came up.

16:01.043 --> 16:03.637
If Zuman is in county,
let me go down and talk to him.

16:03.812 --> 16:05.803
No, no, no.
You are not going anywhere.

16:05.981 --> 16:09.644
Detective Gabriel, Detective Sanchez,
let's get Zuman down here for a chat.

16:09.818 --> 16:13.811
Let's see how surprised he is to see
Lieutenant Flynn standing upright.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.487
Love the new place, guys.

16:21.296 --> 16:25.198
Congratulations on winning that award
for best new building in Los Angeles.

16:25.367 --> 16:28.336
Do you feel this place makes
you more, um, productive?

16:28.504 --> 16:30.335
Shut up.

16:39.581 --> 16:40.673
Lieutenant Flynn.

16:40.849 --> 16:42.783
Good to see you looking so well.

16:42.951 --> 16:45.112
Oh, I spoke too soon.

16:45.320 --> 16:48.255
- What happened?
- Some guy brought a knife to a gunfight.

16:48.424 --> 16:49.857
I gather you had the gun.

16:50.025 --> 16:52.789
You know it's illegal to question me
without my attorney.

16:52.961 --> 16:55.293
I love that you guys
are doing something illegal.

16:55.464 --> 16:58.228
Always nice to meet someone
who understands their rights.

16:58.400 --> 17:01.267
Once you've had them taken away,
you appreciate them more.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.928
That's a waiver.
Now you're on the record, Mr. Zuman.

17:04.106 --> 17:06.074
Keep talking, Ricky, just keep talking.

17:06.241 --> 17:08.300
<i>Well, I'm glad you feel</i>
<i>that way, Mr. Zuman.</i>

17:08.477 --> 17:10.877
- But...
- Please. Call me Rick.

17:11.046 --> 17:12.707
All right, Rick.

17:12.881 --> 17:15.474
You should know that you are
my number one suspect...

17:15.651 --> 17:17.550
...in the attempted murder
of Lt. Flynn.

17:17.720 --> 17:22.817
Well, I have a great alibi if it happened
any time in the last 15 years.

17:22.991 --> 17:25.983
But anything I can do to help...

17:26.161 --> 17:28.994
You could let me knock
that smug grin off your face.

17:29.164 --> 17:30.324
Do you know Bob Harris?

17:30.499 --> 17:33.900
He was in county with you
up until about three days ago.

17:34.069 --> 17:37.402
I am horrible with names.

17:37.606 --> 17:38.834
Much better with faces.

17:39.007 --> 17:40.907
I try not to get too close to anyone.

17:41.076 --> 17:44.375
One minute they're here
and the next, poof.

17:47.282 --> 17:49.682
Maybe this picture
will jog your memory.

17:50.252 --> 17:54.814
Yeah. This is not really
how people look in jail.

17:54.990 --> 17:58.926
Maybe if you had something of him
in an orange or blue uniform.

17:59.094 --> 18:03.030
Orange is more lockdown,
blue is kind of a general population vibe.

18:03.198 --> 18:09.762
Besides, what motive would I possibly
have for wanting Lieutenant Flynn dead?

18:11.140 --> 18:14.701
Other than the fact that he manipulated
evidence, intimidated a witness...

18:14.910 --> 18:16.172
...and perjured himself...

18:16.345 --> 18:18.939
...to have me sentenced to death.
- Heh.

18:19.114 --> 18:21.776
- Now, why would he do that?
- Ask him.

18:21.950 --> 18:23.941
Or the federal government.

18:24.119 --> 18:26.451
<i>You operate</i>
<i>a successful business like mine...</i>

18:26.622 --> 18:29.955
<i>...and people assume you're laundering</i>
<i>money and selling coke.</i>

18:30.125 --> 18:32.855
By the way,
how do you like the cartels, hmm?

18:33.028 --> 18:35.656
Everything better now that
the Mexican Mafia's running the show?

18:35.831 --> 18:38.561
I wouldn't know.
I deal mainly with homicide.

18:38.734 --> 18:40.895
Why have you been back in county
for so long?

18:41.069 --> 18:42.229
New trial.

18:43.806 --> 18:46.536
My appeal was granted
a couple years ago...

18:46.708 --> 18:49.199
...but the judge keeps extending
the People's case...

18:49.378 --> 18:51.710
...so they can make up
for the witness they lost.

18:52.247 --> 18:54.215
What witness did we lose?

18:57.719 --> 18:58.981
Floria Stenzel.

18:59.154 --> 19:00.712
Remember her, lieutenant?

19:00.889 --> 19:04.723
My bookkeeper you coerced
into contradicting my alibi?

19:05.460 --> 19:06.722
Coerced?

19:06.895 --> 19:08.658
That is a hundred percent crap.

19:08.831 --> 19:12.699
Well, bless her soul, Floria found God.

19:12.868 --> 19:15.837
And, uh, as part of her amends...

19:16.705 --> 19:20.505
You know something about amends,
don't you, lieutenant?

19:23.245 --> 19:25.406
As part of her amends,
she has withdrawn...

19:25.581 --> 19:27.344
...the wickedly false statements...

19:27.516 --> 19:29.575
...you pressured her
into making against me.

19:29.751 --> 19:31.275
No, no, lieutenant.

19:31.486 --> 19:33.215
Let me.

19:35.891 --> 19:38.416
I know a little something
about amends too, Rick.

19:41.530 --> 19:45.261
Rick. That's AA language,
which makes me think...

19:45.434 --> 19:49.234
...that you've been looking into Lt.
Flynn's life. And I don't like that.

19:49.404 --> 19:53.568
Let me tell you real quick what's gonna
happen when you go back to county.

19:53.742 --> 19:56.643
They're gonna put you straight
into solitary confinement...

19:56.812 --> 19:59.542
...so you won't be able
to communicate with anybody.

19:59.715 --> 20:02.149
And while you're in there,
I'll be out here...

20:02.317 --> 20:05.980
...looking for the person or persons
that you paid to kill Lieutenant Flynn.

20:06.154 --> 20:08.782
And when I find them,
you're gonna come back in here.

20:08.957 --> 20:11.585
You're gonna tell me everything
I wanna know.

20:11.760 --> 20:13.250
You understand me?

20:16.531 --> 20:17.930
<i>Chief, Captain Raydor's here.</i>

20:18.567 --> 20:20.728
Don't let me keep you.

20:26.608 --> 20:28.667
You knew about these charges
claiming...

20:28.844 --> 20:32.678
...that Lt. Flynn threatened a witnesses
and you didn't say anything about it?

20:32.848 --> 20:34.281
By law, I can't tell you.

20:34.449 --> 20:39.580
Forcefully intimidating a witness
is a serious and confidential accusation.

20:39.755 --> 20:42.280
We can't just tell the suspect.

20:42.457 --> 20:44.288
I almost get killed and I'm a suspect?

20:44.459 --> 20:49.624
You've just been pretending to be helpful
here so you can investigate Andy, right?

20:49.798 --> 20:53.290
No, that is not right. I didn't know
the Rick Zuman case was connected...

20:53.468 --> 20:56.369
...to the attempt
on Lieutenant Flynn's life until today.

20:56.571 --> 20:58.630
The minute you found out,
you should have told me.

20:58.807 --> 21:00.502
No. I couldn't.

21:00.676 --> 21:02.268
Okay, here is how it works.

21:02.444 --> 21:06.005
Every time we get a defense request
for a Pitchess motion...

21:06.181 --> 21:09.150
...we are required, by law,
to look into the history...

21:09.318 --> 21:15.018
...of the accused officer's behavior
without notifying him or his division.

21:15.190 --> 21:19.024
Most officers' packages, lieutenant,
are about this big.

21:19.194 --> 21:21.685
Yours is huge.

21:21.863 --> 21:24.457
It's crammed with accusations.

21:25.033 --> 21:27.467
Exonerated of every charge.

21:27.636 --> 21:30.298
But your history lends credence
to Rick Zuman's case...

21:30.472 --> 21:32.906
...and to Floria's new testimony.

21:33.108 --> 21:35.576
Well, Floria's lying. She found God.

21:35.744 --> 21:39.145
I bet she found him
under a big wad of old money.

21:39.314 --> 21:40.406
That may be so.

21:40.615 --> 21:43.641
But in the meantime, we are going
to precisely follow the law.

21:43.819 --> 21:45.582
- Okay, here we go.
- Yes, here we go.

21:45.754 --> 21:46.982
Ballistics came back.

21:47.155 --> 21:50.090
Lieutenant Flynn's bullets
did match those in Bob Harris.

21:50.258 --> 21:53.056
So this is officially
an officer-involved shooting.

21:53.228 --> 21:57.164
Also, you can no longer participate
in the investigation of Rick Zuman...

21:57.332 --> 22:01.735
...because he will claim that you will
once again stack the deck against him.

22:02.170 --> 22:03.228
I'm not leaving.

22:04.506 --> 22:06.872
She's right. You need to go home.

22:07.042 --> 22:10.239
Get some rest. Okay?
Let me handle this.

22:22.357 --> 22:25.520
That man, Rick Zuman,
tried to kill him.

22:25.694 --> 22:26.888
If you can prove that...

22:27.062 --> 22:30.964
...my witness tampering investigation
of Lieutenant Flynn would be over.

22:31.166 --> 22:35.432
Okay, good. Then help me. I want
everything you have on Floria Stenzel.

22:38.373 --> 22:42.867
This is her basic information
and everything else is confidential.

22:43.045 --> 22:46.276
And you cannot ask her anything
about her upcoming testimony.

22:46.748 --> 22:48.909
I'm not gonna ask her anything
about anything.

22:49.084 --> 22:51.450
- No?
- No.

22:51.920 --> 22:54.582
Floria Stenzel's gonna come talk
to me.

23:01.129 --> 23:03.927
- Come in.
- Why was I not informed about...?

23:04.132 --> 23:05.360
How's Lieutenant Flynn?

23:05.534 --> 23:07.161
- He's home.
- Resting.

23:07.335 --> 23:10.168
Good. Proceed with your outrage.

23:10.338 --> 23:13.899
Why was I not informed of Captain
Raydor's investigation into Lt. Flynn?

23:14.076 --> 23:17.409
Because I didn't know anything about it
until you just said that.

23:18.747 --> 23:22.410
Oh. Why was I not informed
about the DA's retrial of Rick Zuman?

23:22.584 --> 23:25.348
- Who's Rick Zuman?
- A convicted murderer.

23:25.520 --> 23:29.957
He's getting a retrial because he says
Lt. Flynn lied and intimidated a witness.

23:30.158 --> 23:32.592
- He filed a complaint.
- Oh, that Rick Zuman.

23:32.761 --> 23:36.424
Yeah. Last year,
there were 4999 complaints filed...

23:36.598 --> 23:40.591
...so I'm not on a first name basis
with everybody who's awaiting a retrial.

23:40.769 --> 23:42.566
Fill me in.

23:42.804 --> 23:46.467
Oh, okay. Uh, in 1995, Rick Zuman
had a bunch of nightclubs...

23:46.675 --> 23:49.303
...he used to launder the money
he made selling cocaine.

23:49.478 --> 23:52.311
He also periodically killed
his business partners.

23:52.481 --> 23:56.918
Now, Flynn's brilliant police work
helped put this creep behind bars...

23:57.085 --> 23:58.416
...for two of those murders.

23:58.587 --> 24:01.317
But then suddenly,
this Zuman gets a retrial...

24:01.490 --> 24:05.119
...because out of the blue, the witness
against him, this Floria Stenzel...

24:05.293 --> 24:10.060
...she claims Flynn forced her
to back out of Rick's alibi.

24:10.232 --> 24:11.722
Did Flynn do that?

24:11.900 --> 24:15.631
Don't tell me. I don't wanna know that.
So Zuman gets a new trial?

24:15.804 --> 24:18.295
Yes, but not because of Andy Flynn.

24:18.473 --> 24:22.466
I'm telling you, chief, somebody paid
this woman to change her testimony.

24:22.644 --> 24:24.976
She has no job,
she maxed out her credit cards...

24:25.147 --> 24:27.445
...but she's been spending money
like crazy.

24:27.616 --> 24:29.140
New car. Elective surgery.

24:29.317 --> 24:31.751
And this is after
she changed her testimony.

24:31.920 --> 24:34.150
- Can we prove somebody paid her?
- No.

24:34.322 --> 24:37.086
- Which is why I need a protection detail.
- For whom?

24:37.259 --> 24:38.351
Floria Stenzel.

24:38.527 --> 24:40.461
- Protection from whom?
- Us.

25:01.349 --> 25:04.045
Hello. This is Commander Taylor.
I'm Detective Gabriel.

25:04.252 --> 25:06.516
We're from the L.A.P.D.
Are you Floria Stenzel?

25:07.189 --> 25:08.281
Yes.

25:08.456 --> 25:11.391
Our records indicate you're a witness
in an upcoming trial.

25:11.560 --> 25:13.221
<i>California v. Rick Zuman.</i>

25:13.395 --> 25:16.558
We're here to notify you
that you might be in danger.

25:16.765 --> 25:18.198
Why?

25:18.366 --> 25:21.164
I changed my testimony. I recanted.

25:21.336 --> 25:23.531
What reason would I have
to be worried?

25:23.705 --> 25:25.673
I don't know too much
about the case.

25:25.840 --> 25:28.172
I just know you're the last witness
we have left.

25:28.343 --> 25:31.506
- We do not want to lose you.
- What do you mean "last witness"?

25:31.713 --> 25:34.341
The investigating officer
was stabbed to death.

25:34.516 --> 25:37.041
And another person connected
to this Rick Zuman...

25:37.219 --> 25:38.880
...he was murdered a few days ago.

25:39.054 --> 25:41.818
The good news is we do have
a description of the suspect.

25:41.990 --> 25:47.257
He is a Latino male, approximately 5'8 ",
wearing a faded blue hoodie.

25:47.429 --> 25:49.192
Was seen a few miles from here...

25:49.364 --> 25:52.265
...driving an old two-tone
brown and tan Grand Prix.

25:52.434 --> 25:56.734
You should be fully informed given the
heinous nature of the recent murders.

25:56.905 --> 25:59.533
If you don't mind,
we need you to sign this form...

25:59.708 --> 26:01.938
...that states that you were notified...

26:02.110 --> 26:05.238
...and may be under threat
of bodily harm, injury and even death.

26:05.413 --> 26:07.005
Thank you.

26:10.051 --> 26:11.951
- Here?
- Mm-hm. Thank you, ma'am.

26:12.120 --> 26:14.145
And, uh, do you have any weapons
in your home?

26:14.322 --> 26:16.620
Uh, no. Should I?

26:16.825 --> 26:18.918
- No.
- No. Um, absolutely not.

26:19.094 --> 26:20.686
If you do have any problems...

26:20.862 --> 26:23.729
...or you see anyone matching
the description we gave you...

26:23.898 --> 26:26.867
...please, for your own sake,
give us a call. All right?

26:27.035 --> 26:29.162
Well, thank you very much.
You have a good day.

26:29.571 --> 26:30.970
Mm-hm.

26:56.965 --> 27:00.799
That's her, Detective Sanchez.
Make sure you make eye contact.

27:26.995 --> 27:29.327
- <i>911.</i>
- Okay. There is... Ahem.

27:29.497 --> 27:32.193
There is a man outside my house.

27:32.400 --> 27:36.461
He is wearing a blue sweatshirt
with a hoodie.

27:36.638 --> 27:40.267
<i>Calm down, say that again? I'm</i>
<i>trying to figure out what your emergency is.</i>

27:40.442 --> 27:43.673
It's a Mexican. It's a Mexican killer.

27:43.845 --> 27:48.214
- <i>Does he have a weapon, ma'am?</i>
- He is wearing a blue hoodie.

27:48.416 --> 27:50.350
<i>Okay, ma'am. Please hold.</i>

27:51.619 --> 27:53.416
Ugh.

27:58.660 --> 28:01.220
Hold on just a minute. Lieutenant?

28:01.730 --> 28:03.561
- Provenza.
- <i>This is L.A.P.D.</i>

28:03.732 --> 28:07.566
<i>We got a 911 call from a Floria Stenzel.</i>
<i>We were told to call before responding.</i>

28:07.736 --> 28:11.638
Yeah, don't send anyone over here
and ignore her calls.

28:11.806 --> 28:15.207
We've got Miss Stenzel's house
under surveillance.

28:16.211 --> 28:18.008
All right. It's working.

28:18.179 --> 28:22.013
Detective Sanchez, let's get into position
for the big surprise.

28:38.633 --> 28:42.069
It was him. It was the guy
with the blue hoodie. It was him.

28:42.237 --> 28:46.503
- It's a good thing we stopped by earlier.
- My God, he was right outside my door.

28:46.674 --> 28:49.199
Oh, that's just terrible.

28:49.377 --> 28:51.572
Horrible. I'm sure.

28:51.746 --> 28:53.839
You were right to call us.

28:54.015 --> 28:56.006
Thank you
for signing the consent form...

28:56.184 --> 28:58.516
...and allowing my detective
to secure your home.

28:58.686 --> 29:00.847
He'll make sure everything
is safe for you...

29:01.022 --> 29:06.892
...and the $30,000 in old $20 bills
we found in your dresser.

29:15.103 --> 29:16.900
Look...

29:18.506 --> 29:19.803
...you can keep the money.

29:20.642 --> 29:25.204
Yeah, I wanna go back to my original
testimony against Rick Zuman.

29:25.380 --> 29:28.816
I made a horrible mistake
and, please, you have to help me.

29:29.017 --> 29:31.417
There, huh? Happy now?

29:31.586 --> 29:33.713
She claims she was paid
for her testimony...

29:33.888 --> 29:36.049
...but she's hardly
the most reliable witness.

29:36.224 --> 29:39.284
If I'm to close my investigation
into Lieutenant Flynn...

29:39.461 --> 29:41.326
...I need to know who paid her.

29:42.030 --> 29:44.225
I want to protect you, Floria, I do.

29:44.399 --> 29:46.833
But until I know how you
communicate with Zuman...

29:47.035 --> 29:49.902
...and where you got this money,
there's not much I can do.

29:51.105 --> 29:52.936
Okay.

29:53.141 --> 29:55.837
There is this man. Jeff.

29:56.044 --> 29:57.272
He came to my house...

29:57.445 --> 30:00.278
...he offered me this money
if I would go back to saying...

30:00.448 --> 30:02.973
...that Rick Zuman was with me
during these murders.

30:05.119 --> 30:06.984
That's it. That's all I know.

30:07.922 --> 30:10.413
There's a lot of people named Jeff
in L.A. county.

30:10.592 --> 30:13.493
Do you have a last name for me
or a physical description?

30:15.363 --> 30:16.990
Maybe an astrological sign?

30:18.066 --> 30:20.296
That's all I know.

30:21.469 --> 30:22.697
Okay.

30:22.871 --> 30:26.307
Well, I heard you found God recently,
Floria. Maybe he'll protect you.

30:26.474 --> 30:29.841
- <i>I'll get an officer to take you back...</i>
- <i>Okay. Wait.</i>

30:30.011 --> 30:31.501
<i>Wait.</i>

30:34.315 --> 30:38.809
Jeff, the man who gave me this money,
I have his cell phone number.

30:45.527 --> 30:48.394
Floria gave up a name. Jeff.

30:48.563 --> 30:50.030
- Ring a bell?
- No.

30:52.534 --> 30:54.058
Thanks, Mike.

30:56.237 --> 30:58.068
Excuse me, lieutenant.

30:58.606 --> 31:03.236
Um, no offense, but I thought the chief said
that you couldn't return to work.

31:03.411 --> 31:07.507
- Well, we need Flynn to ID this guy...
- And then I'm out of here.

31:07.682 --> 31:11.049
Fine. I didn't see you. But I would
be looking out for Captain Raydor.

31:11.219 --> 31:13.517
Raydor? Well, she knows we're here.

31:13.688 --> 31:16.020
She's coming in herself in a minute.

31:16.190 --> 31:17.384
Jeff, darling.

31:17.559 --> 31:21.620
I hate to call you, but something
has come up and, uh, I need to see you.

31:21.796 --> 31:23.764
But you can't come to my house.

31:23.932 --> 31:30.303
Yeah, you could meet me tomorrow
at 4 p.m. in front of 412 Azalia Lane.

31:30.505 --> 31:33.531
<i>It's just, uh, two blocks from my house.</i>

31:33.708 --> 31:36.404
<i>Yeah. I'll be in a friend's Prius...</i>

31:36.578 --> 31:40.139
<i>...with the license plate El Buzzo.</i>

31:40.315 --> 31:45.252
<i>I'll be wearing a scarf</i>
<i>over my head, darling. Bye.</i>

31:45.420 --> 31:47.752
- Floria, we can't keep me...
- Hi.

31:47.922 --> 31:50.550
- Who the hell are you? You're not...
- Floria, I know.

31:50.725 --> 31:53.888
But thanks for meeting me
on such short notice, Jeff.

31:54.062 --> 31:57.088
Yeah, she told me your name.
Floria told me things about you.

31:57.265 --> 31:58.994
Oh, she's getting crumbs everywhere.

31:59.167 --> 32:01.465
The car's self-parking,
not self-cleaning.

32:02.036 --> 32:03.094
That's the guy.

32:03.271 --> 32:05.603
<i>I'm Deputy Chief</i>
<i>Brenda Leigh Johnson. L.A.P.D.</i>

32:05.773 --> 32:08.970
That's the guy who I talked to
after the AA meeting.

32:09.143 --> 32:11.134
Well, thank you, lieutenant.

32:11.679 --> 32:14.807
And as we agreed earlier,
you can go home now.

32:14.983 --> 32:18.783
Okay. But I should tell you,
I'm moving really slowly.

32:19.787 --> 32:23.814
Floria told me you paid her to change
her testimony in the Rick Zuman trial.

32:23.992 --> 32:27.257
- I never gave Floria a dime.
- That's not even worth lying about.

32:27.428 --> 32:31.296
But the real issue here is that someone
tried to kill a friend of mine.

32:31.466 --> 32:34.799
A police officer who's also due to testify
in the Rick Zuman retrial?

32:34.969 --> 32:36.027
Lieutenant Andy Flynn.

32:36.204 --> 32:38.468
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

32:38.640 --> 32:41.108
<i>Okay, before you completely freak out...</i>

32:41.275 --> 32:43.140
<i>...ask yourself this question first.</i>

32:43.311 --> 32:46.303
Like, why am I here
instead of the back of a squad car?

32:46.481 --> 32:49.382
Why aren't I already under arrest
for murder?

32:49.584 --> 32:50.642
I didn't kill anybody.

32:50.818 --> 32:52.877
I wonder if Bob Harris
would agree with you.

32:53.087 --> 32:56.147
He's who you hired
to kill Lieutenant Flynn? Isn't he?

32:56.324 --> 32:59.384
You know what I have in my purse?
A warrant to search your car.

33:00.028 --> 33:04.055
What if I used that warrant and found
Bob's blood or his DNA in your vehicle?

33:04.232 --> 33:07.531
I didn't kill him. I swear...
That cop shot him. I just...

33:07.702 --> 33:11.297
You just drove around for an hour.
Passed 30 hospitals until he bled out.

33:12.373 --> 33:16.400
You dumped his body. If it's not murder,
it's the worst case of littering I've seen.

33:16.611 --> 33:17.839
Okay, what do you want?

33:18.012 --> 33:21.345
- Okay? What do you want?
- Now, that's the right question.

33:22.884 --> 33:24.977
I want what you gave Bob and Floria.

33:25.153 --> 33:27.951
Only I want a lot more of it.
A hundred thousand dollars.

33:28.122 --> 33:30.147
- Oh.
- And then Rick Zuman goes on to retrial...

33:30.324 --> 33:31.586
...as planned.

33:31.759 --> 33:33.624
Or I turn you in.

33:35.863 --> 33:38.024
- I need time.
- You've got three hours.

33:39.867 --> 33:41.835
You know what I don't understand,
Jeff...

33:42.003 --> 33:45.268
...is why you care so much
about Rick Zuman getting out of jail?

33:45.440 --> 33:48.341
You're free.
You know where the money is.

33:49.077 --> 33:51.170
Some people care about
more than just money.

33:51.345 --> 33:53.210
Well, I'm not one of them.

33:54.716 --> 33:56.707
You've got until 7
to get me that money.

33:56.884 --> 33:59.717
Or the next time we talk,
things will end differently.

34:12.033 --> 34:13.795
<i>Are the bags I gave him transmitting?</i>

34:15.570 --> 34:16.628
Clear as day.

34:16.804 --> 34:20.399
<i>Good. Then tell Lieutenant Provenza</i>
<i>to swing by and pick up Rick Zuman.</i>

34:20.574 --> 34:22.907
<i>See you later, Captain Raydor.</i>

34:58.446 --> 35:01.210
Drop the bag.
Put your hands in the air.

35:01.749 --> 35:03.614
What's this about?

35:03.785 --> 35:06.948
Officers, please escort this gentleman
downtown.

35:15.530 --> 35:19.022
Special Agent Howard,
would you like to examine those bills?

35:19.233 --> 35:21.258
Yes, I would.

35:23.104 --> 35:27.040
Shouldn't we have waited until he
delivered the money to Chief Johnson?

35:27.241 --> 35:30.438
If I were going to charge him
with bribing a police officer, yes.

35:30.611 --> 35:34.138
But under these circumstances,
simply finding the FBI money...

35:34.315 --> 35:36.112
...ties Jeff to murder...

35:36.284 --> 35:38.548
...attempted murder
and witness intimidation.

35:38.753 --> 35:40.812
Not to mention
a missing FBI informant...

35:40.988 --> 35:44.151
...who seems increasingly
like a possible homicide victim.

35:45.326 --> 35:47.157
- Some of these bills match up.
- Good.

35:47.328 --> 35:51.230
I think this closes my case against
Lieutenant Flynn for witness tampering.

35:51.399 --> 35:54.664
And reopens a murder case
of an FBI informant.

35:56.838 --> 36:01.298
Ricky. So sorry for all the boxes.
We're still moving into the new facility.

36:01.475 --> 36:03.966
Have you met Andy Flynn's partner,
Lt. Provenza?

36:04.145 --> 36:07.171
He's been so looking forward
to meeting you.

36:07.882 --> 36:09.213
How's solitary been?

36:09.383 --> 36:12.978
Must be hard. You don't seem to be
a guy who likes to be alone.

36:13.154 --> 36:16.317
- Now, why would you think that?
- You're used to having company.

36:16.490 --> 36:19.891
- While in county, you had 32 roommates.
- Some must have been special.

36:20.061 --> 36:22.859
- Weren't they?
- I'm not sure what you're getting at.

36:23.030 --> 36:25.692
You wouldn't trust a stranger
to kill Lieutenant Flynn.

36:25.867 --> 36:27.232
<i>Oh, my.</i>

36:27.401 --> 36:31.838
Has anyone ever explained to you
the concept of ineffective repetition?

36:32.006 --> 36:35.339
Oh, I'm so sorry. I forgot.
You're better with faces.

36:36.744 --> 36:38.769
This is Jeff Darby.

36:38.946 --> 36:40.743
He was your roommate
for four months.

36:41.849 --> 36:43.009
That's a long time.

36:43.184 --> 36:46.415
Your next closest roommate
lasted only three weeks.

36:46.587 --> 36:48.054
Jeff must have been special.

36:48.222 --> 36:50.622
Hmm. Not really.

36:51.325 --> 36:52.917
But you ate lunch together.

36:54.328 --> 36:58.059
And he visited you,
even after he got out.

36:58.232 --> 37:03.363
You and Jeff roomed together
as cellmates for 123 days straight.

37:03.537 --> 37:07.439
In fact, you were more than
just roommates. Weren't you?

37:07.608 --> 37:10.406
You and Jeff formed a real bond
between you.

37:10.578 --> 37:14.639
If you're implying
a physical relationship, okay.

37:14.849 --> 37:17.716
- You were in love with Jeff Darby.
- Heh.

37:17.919 --> 37:20.444
No. But I'm in prison.

37:20.621 --> 37:23.283
Jeff relieved the tedium.

37:23.457 --> 37:24.947
Jeff feels differently.

37:25.126 --> 37:27.754
In fact, he's been very cooperative.

37:28.396 --> 37:30.990
Look, I'm not sure
what lies Jeff's been telling you...

37:31.165 --> 37:33.599
...but he was obsessed with me.

37:33.768 --> 37:38.603
At first, I felt sorry for him,
but then he got all clingy.

37:38.773 --> 37:41.867
To be fair, he's young
and likes older guys.

37:42.610 --> 37:44.009
I get it.

37:44.178 --> 37:46.510
But in kind of the same way
I feel about you...

37:47.281 --> 37:49.442
...I wish he'd just go away.

37:50.584 --> 37:53.985
Now, can we wrap this up?
I'd like to go now.

37:55.489 --> 37:57.081
Okay.

37:57.959 --> 38:01.122
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Wait a minute, Detective Sanchez.

38:01.329 --> 38:02.956
How about...?

38:04.265 --> 38:09.134
How about I bet you 20 bucks,
I can get you to confess?

38:09.303 --> 38:11.032
Now you're embarrassing yourself.

38:11.205 --> 38:14.140
Okay. What if we raised the stakes?

38:14.308 --> 38:19.644
What if I bet you $100
you'd confess?

38:19.814 --> 38:22.305
I'd just be taking your money.
Hardly seems fair.

38:22.483 --> 38:25.782
Chief, I think we should, uh,
up the ante here a bit.

38:26.320 --> 38:28.379
How about this? How about $10,000?

38:28.556 --> 38:31.047
You know what?
Let's make it $400,000...

38:31.225 --> 38:34.319
...I can get you to tell me everything
I wanna know.

38:34.695 --> 38:37.061
Fine. I'll take that bet.

38:37.231 --> 38:38.323
What do you got?

38:43.838 --> 38:45.738
Jeff Darby led me
to your storage space.

38:46.540 --> 38:50.670
Woo-hoo. I'm a winner
because I'm still not confessing.

38:51.178 --> 38:54.238
Now, will you please pick up my money
because when I'm free...

38:54.448 --> 38:57.008
<i>...I'm going to count</i>
<i>every single bill...</i>

38:57.184 --> 39:01.348
...and make sure that you didn't slide
a few of them into your cheap purse.

39:01.522 --> 39:06.084
There's nothing illegal about a citizen
keeping cash in a storage space.

39:08.162 --> 39:10.323
Well, that's true. Usually.

39:10.498 --> 39:12.466
But all this money? It's marked.

39:13.234 --> 39:15.429
You may not realize this,
but in 1995...

39:15.603 --> 39:18.436
...you took $400,000
from an FBI informant.

39:18.606 --> 39:22.064
And every one of these old bills
is completely traceable to him.

39:22.243 --> 39:24.575
By saying this is your money,
you confessed...

39:24.745 --> 39:27.737
...not only to money laundering,
but to selling drugs...

39:28.516 --> 39:30.882
...and to bribing a witness...

39:31.052 --> 39:34.544
...and conspiracy
to murder a police officer.

39:34.722 --> 39:36.451
So woo-hoo, I win.

39:36.624 --> 39:38.717
You owe me $400,000.

39:41.128 --> 39:44.256
I'll tell you what, I'll give all this money
back to the FBI...

39:44.432 --> 39:47.993
...you spend the rest of your life
on death row and we'll call it even.

40:02.183 --> 40:05.152
I thought
that you might like this back.

40:05.319 --> 40:07.810
Flynn's package.
He's completely cleared.

40:07.988 --> 40:09.979
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

40:10.357 --> 40:12.757
So, uh, what's been going on?

40:12.927 --> 40:14.690
Why have you been so nice?

40:14.862 --> 40:16.727
I could ask the same about you.

40:16.897 --> 40:17.989
I've been nice?

40:19.066 --> 40:21.830
No, but cooperative.

40:23.437 --> 40:24.529
I had a thought.

40:25.272 --> 40:28.537
While Chief Delk is completing
his transition plans...

40:28.709 --> 40:32.042
...maybe you and I could figure out
a way for FID and Major Crimes...

40:32.213 --> 40:33.771
...to better share their cases.

40:34.915 --> 40:38.749
Say, uh, over a... I don't know.
Working lunch.

40:38.919 --> 40:41.353
- Lunch?
- Great, I'll set it up.

40:42.823 --> 40:44.415
Oh.

40:44.592 --> 40:46.526
Agent Howard.

40:47.361 --> 40:50.455
By the way, nice working with you.
It was great.

40:50.664 --> 40:52.723
And you, captain.

40:56.237 --> 40:57.465
Is everything all right?

40:57.671 --> 40:59.730
I think so, yes.

41:00.808 --> 41:03.299
I know you don't wanna hear this,
but, uh...

41:04.111 --> 41:07.478
...you should really start thinking
about which one of Pope's drawers...

41:07.681 --> 41:09.205
...you wanna fill up with candy.

41:09.383 --> 41:10.645
That's not funny.

41:10.818 --> 41:13.412
Brenda, come on. It'd be great.

41:14.989 --> 41:16.217
Besides, think about it.

41:16.390 --> 41:20.486
Someone less qualified takes over
from Pope, you'll be miserable.

41:26.700 --> 41:28.190
So get ready.

41:28.836 --> 41:30.633
Where do you wanna go?
Where we going?

41:31.338 --> 41:34.671
One day, sooner than you think...

41:34.842 --> 41:38.608
...Chief Delk's gonna offer you the job
of assistant chief of police.

41:38.779 --> 41:40.576
What happened to chicken and waffles?

41:40.748 --> 41:43.080
I'm not going
to that chicken and waffles place.

41:44.985 --> 41:48.216
- So you better figure out what you want.
- Flynn.

41:50.724 --> 41:53.750
So no chicken and waffles?

41:53.928 --> 41:55.589
I already know what I want.

41:55.763 --> 41:57.025
What's that?

42:04.538 --> 42:06.369
Five more minutes.

42:07.305 --> 42:13.541
