00:13.709 --> 00:15.125
- Nothing.

Wait, what are you doing

00:15.166 --> 00:16.750

00:16.792 --> 00:21.041
- Oh, I'm in here all the time,

- Oh. Get out.

00:23.542 --> 00:24.542

00:24.583 --> 00:26.083
- Nothing, get out.

00:26.125 --> 00:30.375

00:30.417 --> 00:32.083
So I figured it was a diary.

00:32.125 --> 00:34.083

- Ooh, you have a diary?

00:34.125 --> 00:36.583
- No.

00:36.625 --> 00:38.834
- Anything in there about us?

00:38.875 --> 00:41.250
- Diaries are for

00:38.875 --> 00:41.250

00:41.291 --> 00:46.417

00:41.291 --> 00:46.417

00:53.625 --> 00:56.583
Look, I respect your privacy

00:53.625 --> 00:56.583

00:56.625 --> 00:58.792
appreciate it

00:56.625 --> 00:58.792

You can trust us.

- Absolutely.

01:08.875 --> 01:10.000
- Coast is clear.

01:10.709 --> 01:13.625

and see what she writes about

01:10.709 --> 01:13.625

01:16.792 --> 01:22.625
- No diary, just this weird

01:16.792 --> 01:22.625
ear-warmer thing.

01:22.667 --> 01:24.542
- These aren't ear-warmers.

08:11.875 --> 08:15.667
squeaks a little.

08:15.709 --> 08:18.792
- You heard me, boys.

08:15.709 --> 08:18.792
I said lights out.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.250
<i>[bed creaks]</i>

08:20.333 --> 08:23.250
<i>[all scream]</i>

08:24.792 --> 08:26.125
- [sighs]

08:31.291 --> 08:33.250
<i>- ♪ La, la-la-la ♪</i>

08:33.291 --> 08:39.250
- Five, carry the two,

08:33.291 --> 08:39.250
divide that by three equals...

08:39.291 --> 08:41.291
I hate homework.

08:41.333 --> 08:44.709
- That's the same answer

08:41.333 --> 08:44.709
I got.

08:44.750 --> 08:47.667
- Dawn, Dawn, Dawn,

08:44.750 --> 08:47.667
or Dawn to the third power

08:47.709 --> 08:50.125
as us math guys like to say.

08:50.166 --> 08:52.125
Why don't you take a little

08:50.166 --> 08:52.125
break and let me

08:52.166 --> 08:53.625
handle the homework situation?

08:53.667 --> 08:56.417
In fact, the Rickulator

08:53.667 --> 08:56.417
has already completed

08:56.458 --> 08:58.000
your assignments for the week.

08:58.041 --> 09:02.542
You know you can<i> count</i>

08:58.041 --> 09:02.542
on me to get you an A.

09:02.583 --> 09:06.208
Well, a B-plus to make it seem

09:02.583 --> 09:06.208
like you did it.

09:06.250 --> 09:08.458
- Why would you do my homework?

09:08.500 --> 09:10.792
That falls in the...

09:08.500 --> 09:10.792
you broke something,

09:10.834 --> 09:14.291
need something, or have

09:10.834 --> 09:14.291
something to hide category.

09:14.333 --> 09:17.166
- What? Hogwash.

09:17.208 --> 09:18.333
- What's hogwash?

09:18.375 --> 09:21.917
- It's similar

09:18.375 --> 09:21.917
to "balderdash."

09:21.959 --> 09:24.959
And doing your homework

09:21.959 --> 09:24.959
is just what kind,

09:25.000 --> 09:27.166
loving siblings do.

09:27.208 --> 09:30.250
For example, you'd look out

09:27.208 --> 09:30.250
for me if you knew

09:30.291 --> 09:32.875
I was in imminent danger

09:30.291 --> 09:32.875
or if someone

09:32.917 --> 09:34.583
was threatening what I prize

09:32.917 --> 09:34.583
the most

09:34.625 --> 09:37.375
like my perfect attendance

09:34.625 --> 09:37.375
record.

09:37.417 --> 09:40.166
You'd tell me, right?

09:40.208 --> 09:41.792
- Of course.

09:41.834 --> 09:45.041
- So anything

09:41.834 --> 09:45.041
you want to tell me now?

09:45.083 --> 09:47.125
- Nope.

09:47.166 --> 09:49.542
- Well, if anything comes up,

09:47.166 --> 09:49.542
I'll be upstairs

09:49.583 --> 09:51.834
working on your music

09:49.583 --> 09:51.834
history report.

09:51.875 --> 09:56.291
Just remember, I'll always

09:51.875 --> 09:56.291
have your Bach.

09:56.333 --> 09:57.875
See what I did there?

10:03.500 --> 10:06.834
- Wow, this is going way

10:03.500 --> 10:06.834
better than I thought.

10:08.333 --> 10:12.250
Oh, and I smell

10:08.333 --> 10:12.250
chocolate chip paranoia

10:12.291 --> 10:13.834
coming from the kitchen.

10:16.375 --> 10:18.166
- Oh, hello, ladies.

10:18.208 --> 10:20.375
Don't mind me, I'm just baking

10:18.208 --> 10:20.375
some of Dawn's favorite

10:20.417 --> 10:24.291
chocolate chip muffins.

10:24.333 --> 10:26.417
- Mm.

10:24.333 --> 10:26.417
- Mmm.

10:26.458 --> 10:27.875
These are delicious.

10:27.917 --> 10:30.333
- Can you guess

10:27.917 --> 10:30.333
the secret ingredient?

10:30.375 --> 10:32.083
- Sugar?

10:30.375 --> 10:32.083
- No.

10:32.125 --> 10:33.500
- Flour?

10:32.125 --> 10:33.500
- No.

10:33.542 --> 10:34.959
- Baking soda.

10:33.542 --> 10:34.959
- No.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.083
- Chocolate chips?

10:36.125 --> 10:39.083
- Those aren't secret

10:36.125 --> 10:39.083
ingredients!

10:39.125 --> 10:41.583
- Shrimp?

10:39.125 --> 10:41.583
- Trust!

10:41.625 --> 10:45.250
Trust

10:41.625 --> 10:45.250
is the secret ingredient!

10:45.291 --> 10:48.291
Enjoy.

10:48.333 --> 10:50.583
- Why would you

10:48.333 --> 10:50.583
make us muffins?

10:50.625 --> 10:53.291
- I just enjoy doing nice things

10:50.625 --> 10:53.291
for nice people,

10:53.333 --> 10:55.041
like my nice sister Dawn.

10:55.083 --> 10:57.417
- Hogwash!

10:57.458 --> 11:00.166
It's like balderdash.

11:00.208 --> 11:01.709
- No, it's true.

11:01.750 --> 11:02.875
I'm just looking out

11:01.750 --> 11:02.875
for my sis

11:02.917 --> 11:04.417
like she always looks

11:02.917 --> 11:04.417
out for me.

11:04.458 --> 11:07.208
For example, if you knew

11:04.458 --> 11:07.208
someone or...

11:07.250 --> 11:11.125
two people were threatening

11:07.250 --> 11:11.125
what I love most...

11:12.291 --> 11:16.041
Say, my perfectly seasoned

11:12.291 --> 11:16.041
cast iron skillet,

11:16.083 --> 11:18.208
I could trust you

11:16.083 --> 11:18.208
to warn me, right?

11:18.250 --> 11:21.250
- Well, there is something

11:18.250 --> 11:21.250
I do need to warn you about.

11:21.291 --> 11:22.417
- Yes?

11:25.458 --> 11:29.083
- We're gonna eat

11:25.458 --> 11:29.083
all these muffins.

11:29.125 --> 11:32.208
- Wait, isn't there anything

11:29.125 --> 11:32.208
else you want to tell me?

11:32.250 --> 11:33.625
- Nope.

11:36.834 --> 11:38.709
Two down, one to go.

11:38.750 --> 11:40.083
- Hey, girls, whatcha eating?

11:40.125 --> 11:41.208
- Oh, Nicky made muffins.

11:41.250 --> 11:43.625
I think there's one left

11:41.250 --> 11:43.625
in the kitchen.

11:43.667 --> 11:45.041
both: Dibs!

11:48.709 --> 11:53.208
- There she is,

11:48.709 --> 11:53.208
my favorite sister.

11:53.250 --> 11:55.792
- She's your only sister.

11:55.834 --> 11:58.375
- Aren't we all sisters?

11:58.417 --> 12:00.375
Uh, Dawn,

11:58.417 --> 12:00.375
I brought you a gift.

12:00.417 --> 12:01.709
- Why?

12:01.750 --> 12:03.417
- I just felt like

12:01.750 --> 12:03.417
giving you something,

12:03.458 --> 12:06.667
you know, like you'd give me

12:03.458 --> 12:06.667
a warning if you knew

12:06.709 --> 12:09.834
someone wanted to take away

12:06.709 --> 12:09.834
what I prize most.

12:09.875 --> 12:14.667
Like my luscious locks.

12:14.709 --> 12:17.917
- Sure.

12:17.959 --> 12:21.917
Um, Dicky,

12:17.959 --> 12:21.917
this is my lamp.

12:21.959 --> 12:24.542
- I knew you'd love it.

12:24.583 --> 12:26.250
So now that I gave you

12:24.583 --> 12:26.250
something,

12:26.291 --> 12:28.750
is there something you would

12:26.291 --> 12:28.750
like to give me?

12:28.792 --> 12:30.375
Like information?

12:30.417 --> 12:32.166
- Yep.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.166
- Really?

12:32.208 --> 12:33.792
- Oh, did I say "yep"?

12:33.834 --> 12:36.750
I meant nope.

12:36.792 --> 12:39.291
Three for three, doesn't get

12:36.792 --> 12:39.291
any better than this.

12:43.417 --> 12:45.750
Writing fake diary entries

12:43.417 --> 12:45.750
to mess with my brothers

12:45.792 --> 12:48.125
is the best idea

12:45.792 --> 12:48.125
I've ever had.

12:48.166 --> 12:51.917
I now have a homework servant,

12:48.166 --> 12:51.917
a muffin chef,

12:51.959 --> 12:54.709
and a brighter room.

12:54.750 --> 12:56.959
- I can't wait until my

12:54.750 --> 12:56.959
brother's old enough

12:57.000 --> 12:58.625
to read my fake diary.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.542
Mmm, we're out of muffins.

13:04.583 --> 13:07.834
- Relax, I know where we can

13:04.583 --> 13:07.834
go get some more.

13:07.875 --> 13:11.333
- Mmm, s'mores sound good.

13:11.375 --> 13:12.792
- You know what?

13:12.834 --> 13:14.667
Let's get Nicky to make

13:12.834 --> 13:14.667
some of those too.

13:14.709 --> 13:16.542
Just when I thought

13:14.709 --> 13:16.542
it couldn't get any better,

13:16.583 --> 13:18.583
it got s'more better.

13:18.625 --> 13:21.083
[laughter]

13:25.417 --> 13:27.542
- Fake diary entries?

13:27.583 --> 13:30.667
The other boys are never

13:27.583 --> 13:30.667
gonna believe this.

13:30.709 --> 13:32.166
- I believe it.

13:44.208 --> 13:46.208
- I believe it too.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.417
Thanks.

13:54.458 --> 13:56.625
Mae's heavier than I thought.

13:56.667 --> 13:58.375
- What are you guys

13:56.667 --> 13:58.375
doing in here?

13:58.417 --> 14:01.250
- I was trying to get info about

13:58.417 --> 14:01.250
what you guys were gonna do to

13:58.417 --> 14:01.250
me.

14:01.291 --> 14:03.583
- Me, too, but now we know

14:01.291 --> 14:03.583
everything was all made up

14:03.625 --> 14:06.375
so Dawn could manipulate us

14:03.625 --> 14:06.375
into turning on each other.

14:06.417 --> 14:08.750
- I can't believe she

14:06.417 --> 14:08.750
double-crossed us.

14:08.792 --> 14:11.667
- Yeah, who would go to such

14:08.792 --> 14:11.667
lengths just to

14:11.709 --> 14:15.291
betray someone's trust?

14:15.333 --> 14:17.417
- You know, I think it's time

14:15.333 --> 14:17.417
we start working together

14:17.458 --> 14:18.709
to get Dawn back.

14:18.750 --> 14:20.667
- Yeah, and I have a plan.

14:20.709 --> 14:22.375
But first, could you make us

14:20.709 --> 14:22.375
some s'mores?

14:22.417 --> 14:24.041
I'm starving.

14:24.083 --> 14:25.375
I thought I'd have a snack

14:24.083 --> 14:25.375
in the beanbag chair,

14:25.417 --> 14:29.709
but turns out,

14:25.417 --> 14:29.709
these weren't real beans.

for reading your diary.

15:05.417 --> 15:06.750

15:06.792 --> 15:08.625

15:08.667 --> 15:12.083
too big of a deal out of this,

15:12.125 --> 15:15.333
but your most private thoughts

15:12.125 --> 15:15.333
saved my life.

15:15.375 --> 15:19.625
Now I know about Ricky

15:15.375 --> 15:19.625
and Nicky's plot to betray me.

15:19.667 --> 15:21.625
You're my hero,

I'm about to go mess with them

15:21.667 --> 15:24.834
before they can mess with me.

15:32.333 --> 15:35.000
couldn't get any better

15:35.041 --> 15:37.625
from when it got better

15:35.041 --> 15:37.625
after being better?

15:37.667 --> 15:39.750
It just got better.

15:44.625 --> 15:47.166
- Did I miss it?

15:47.208 --> 15:48.583
- No, the boys haven't

15:47.208 --> 15:48.583
come down yet.

15:48.625 --> 15:50.000
This should be good, though.

15:50.041 --> 15:51.875
Dicky really meant business

15:50.041 --> 15:51.875
last night.

15:51.917 --> 15:53.542
- He did?

15:53.583 --> 15:55.166
Are you nervous at all?

15:55.208 --> 15:58.709
What if he does something

15:55.208 --> 15:58.709
really bad?

15:58.750 --> 16:01.667
- Nah, how bad could it be?

Don't worry, it's just

16:09.208 --> 16:11.333
It's not like they're

16:26.083 --> 16:28.458
How's your morning going?

16:28.500 --> 16:29.875
- Okay.

16:29.917 --> 16:32.458
- Can't complain.

16:32.500 --> 16:34.959

16:49.125 --> 16:50.583
The only reason I shaved your

16:49.125 --> 16:50.583
heads was because

16:50.625 --> 16:52.291
I thought

16:50.625 --> 16:52.291
you were gonna shave mine.

16:52.333 --> 16:54.041
- Why would you think that?

16:54.083 --> 16:55.625
- Because I read in Dawn's

16:54.083 --> 16:55.625
diary that you were

16:55.667 --> 16:58.166
gonna take the thing

16:55.667 --> 16:58.166
that I prized most.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.834
- Hiya.

17:05.875 --> 17:09.250
- Dawn, why would you write

17:05.875 --> 17:09.250
a lie like that

17:09.291 --> 17:10.750
in your diary?

17:10.792 --> 17:13.333
- Because you guys invaded

17:10.792 --> 17:13.333
my privacy,

17:13.375 --> 17:15.000
and I wanted to teach you

17:13.375 --> 17:15.000
a lesson.

17:15.041 --> 17:17.667
So I wrote some fake stuff

17:15.041 --> 17:17.667
in my diary

17:17.709 --> 17:19.542
to turn you

17:17.709 --> 17:19.542
against each other.

17:19.583 --> 17:21.000
[all gasp]

17:21.041 --> 17:22.208
- Why would you do that?

17:22.250 --> 17:24.083
- I am shocked.

17:24.125 --> 17:26.959
- And bald.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.667
- I never thought my diary

17:27.000 --> 17:29.667
would cause things

17:29.709 --> 17:31.083
to get this out of control.

17:31.125 --> 17:32.291
I'm sorry.

17:32.333 --> 17:33.750
- We appreciate that, Dawn.

17:33.792 --> 17:35.750
But all the "I'm sorrys"

17:33.792 --> 17:35.750
in the world

17:35.792 --> 17:38.834
won't bring our hair back.

17:38.875 --> 17:40.875
- I know,

17:38.875 --> 17:40.875
and I feel horrible.

17:40.917 --> 17:43.750
I promise I'll find a way

17:40.917 --> 17:43.750
to make it up to you.

17:43.792 --> 17:45.792
- Honestly, Dawn,

17:43.792 --> 17:45.792
I don't know how

17:45.834 --> 17:47.583
that would be possible.

17:56.542 --> 17:59.375
[laughter]

17:59.417 --> 18:00.500
- She totally bought it.

18:00.542 --> 18:02.208
- Who knew the flesh-colored

18:00.542 --> 18:02.208
swim caps

18:02.250 --> 18:07.291
Dad couldn't sell at the store

18:02.250 --> 18:07.291
would finally come in handy?

18:07.333 --> 18:12.375
- My bald cap's starting

18:07.333 --> 18:12.375
to itch. Can I take it off?

18:12.417 --> 18:14.917
- I think we should keep it on

18:12.417 --> 18:14.917
for the rest of the day

18:14.959 --> 18:17.250
and see how guilty we can

18:14.959 --> 18:17.250
make Dawn feel.

18:17.291 --> 18:20.750
In fact, let's start a wish list

18:17.291 --> 18:20.750
of stuff we can

18:20.792 --> 18:22.375
guilt Dawn into giving us.

18:24.375 --> 18:29.083
Number 370,

18:24.375 --> 18:29.083
a hot tub for our bedroom.

18:29.125 --> 18:30.875
- Yeah, I've got some foot

18:29.125 --> 18:30.875
issues you guys

18:30.917 --> 18:33.291
don't want any part of.

18:33.333 --> 18:36.625
- Uh, why not make it

18:33.333 --> 18:36.625
three hot tubs?

18:38.917 --> 18:40.417
- Hi, guys.

18:40.458 --> 18:43.792
Dawn still feels terrible about

18:40.458 --> 18:43.792
the whole fake diary thing.

18:43.834 --> 18:46.083
- She should.

18:43.834 --> 18:46.083
- It was terrible.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.500
- It could've been me.

18:48.542 --> 18:51.250
- But she thinks she found a way

18:48.542 --> 18:51.250
to make it up to you.

18:51.291 --> 18:53.792
- Is it a monkey

18:51.291 --> 18:53.792
on a motorcycle?

18:53.834 --> 18:57.083
If not,

18:53.834 --> 18:57.083
put it on the list.

18:57.125 --> 18:58.458
- Dawn, come on in.

19:01.083 --> 19:03.291
- After some deep thought

19:01.083 --> 19:03.291
and reflection,

19:03.333 --> 19:06.417
I decided that if my fake diary

19:03.333 --> 19:06.417
caused Nicky and Ricky

19:06.458 --> 19:11.208
to be bald,

19:06.458 --> 19:11.208
then I deserve to be bald too.

19:11.250 --> 19:13.834
- What did you do?

19:11.250 --> 19:13.834
- Is it that bad?

19:13.875 --> 19:15.166
- Terrible.

19:13.875 --> 19:15.166
- Awful.

19:15.208 --> 19:16.417
- Gollum!

19:16.458 --> 19:20.166
- Well, you guys don't look

19:16.458 --> 19:20.166
so good either.

19:20.208 --> 19:22.417
both: Actually...

19:26.250 --> 19:28.458
- Bald caps?

19:26.250 --> 19:28.458
- Sorry.

19:28.500 --> 19:31.166
All three of us overheard

19:28.500 --> 19:31.166
you guys talking in your room.

19:31.208 --> 19:33.333
- What? When?

19:31.208 --> 19:33.333
- Last night.

19:33.375 --> 19:36.834
- And by the way, Mae,

19:33.375 --> 19:36.834
you're heavier than you look.

19:36.875 --> 19:38.917
- You were in my room again?

19:38.959 --> 19:41.333
- Yeah, and it's a good thing,

19:38.959 --> 19:41.333
'cause we found out

19:41.375 --> 19:43.083
those diary entries were fake.

19:43.125 --> 19:44.583
- Liar!

19:44.625 --> 19:47.041
- So we're giving you a taste

19:44.625 --> 19:47.041
of your own medicine.

19:47.083 --> 19:48.625
How's it taste, Dawn?

19:48.667 --> 19:51.333
- Taste!

19:51.375 --> 19:54.458
- So I shaved my head

19:51.375 --> 19:54.458
for nothing?

19:54.500 --> 19:57.875
Oh, this is bad.

19:54.500 --> 19:57.875
This is so bad!

19:57.917 --> 19:59.959
I have to go to school tomorrow.

20:00.000 --> 20:01.417
What did I do?

20:01.458 --> 20:03.000
- You know what?

20:03.041 --> 20:06.375
The whole fake head shaving plan

20:03.041 --> 20:06.375
was mine in the first place.

20:06.417 --> 20:09.083
I know what I have to do

20:06.417 --> 20:09.083
to make this right.

20:12.709 --> 20:13.834
[buzzing]

20:13.875 --> 20:15.583
- Wait, Dicky, no!

20:20.458 --> 20:21.959
I was faking it too.

20:27.917 --> 20:30.041
- This story has more twists

20:27.917 --> 20:30.041
than a cinnamon roll.

20:30.083 --> 20:34.667
- Cinnamon rolls only

20:30.083 --> 20:34.667
have one twist.

20:30.083 --> 20:34.667
- But it's a pretty big twist!

20:34.709 --> 20:36.625
- How did you know we were

20:34.709 --> 20:36.625
faking it?

20:36.667 --> 20:39.917
- Mae and I overheard you guys

20:36.667 --> 20:39.917
in here talking about your Dawn

20:36.667 --> 20:39.917
guilt wish list.

20:39.959 --> 20:43.041
- You were eavesdropping

20:39.959 --> 20:43.041
on our private conversation?

20:43.083 --> 20:46.125
- Private? The pass-through

20:43.083 --> 20:46.125
was completely open.

20:53.792 --> 20:55.125
- Yeah, we said,

20:55.166 --> 20:58.875
"Uh, guys, we're right here,"

20:55.166 --> 20:58.875
several times.

20:58.917 --> 21:02.083
- It's still an invasion

20:58.917 --> 21:02.083
of our privacy.

21:02.125 --> 21:04.875
- You know,

21:02.125 --> 21:04.875
when you think about it,

21:04.917 --> 21:08.583
we invaded your privacy,

21:04.917 --> 21:08.583
you invaded our privacy.

21:08.625 --> 21:10.166
It's kind of funny.

21:10.208 --> 21:13.709
- [laughs]

21:10.208 --> 21:13.709
- Yeah, I guess it is.

21:13.750 --> 21:16.792
- Yeah,

21:13.750 --> 21:16.792
nothing really bad happened.

21:16.834 --> 21:19.834
- I shaved my head!

21:21.500 --> 21:24.834
For real!

21:24.875 --> 21:26.667
- Ooh.

21:24.875 --> 21:26.667
- Wow.

21:26.709 --> 21:29.667
- Yikes.

21:26.709 --> 21:29.667
- Your hair really

21:26.709 --> 21:29.667
is everything.

21:29.709 --> 21:33.917
- Your real bald head

21:29.709 --> 21:33.917
has taught us all a lesson.

21:33.959 --> 21:36.875
We could all work on respecting

21:33.959 --> 21:36.875
each other's privacy

21:36.917 --> 21:39.333
so this sort of thing

21:36.917 --> 21:39.333
never happens again.

21:39.375 --> 21:41.250
- Dawn's right.

21:41.291 --> 21:42.583
Who wants cinnamon rolls?

21:42.625 --> 21:45.667
- Oh, yum, me.

21:42.625 --> 21:45.667
- Yeah.

21:45.709 --> 21:47.750
- I shaved my head!

21:52.834 --> 21:55.166
- Looking good, kids.

21:55.208 --> 21:58.000
- Did we all really

21:55.208 --> 21:58.000
have to shave our heads?

21:58.041 --> 22:01.750
- Hey, quad for all,

21:58.041 --> 22:01.750
and all for bald.

22:01.792 --> 22:03.375
- Besides, I'm sure

22:01.792 --> 22:03.375
it'll grow back.

22:03.417 --> 22:05.000
- Maybe.
