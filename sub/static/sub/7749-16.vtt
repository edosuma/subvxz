WEBVTT

00:09.840 --> 00:13.230
We're fine, right?

00:13.280 --> 00:15.407
Yes.

00:15.440 --> 00:17.408
It'll come down
to turnout today.

00:17.450 --> 00:19.748
That's the thing to stress--
that everyone get out and vote.

00:19.780 --> 00:21.372
It's too close not to.

00:21.420 --> 00:22.739
Is it really?

00:22.790 --> 00:24.246
Too close?

00:24.290 --> 00:25.712
No, I...

00:25.750 --> 00:28.412
I think we're solid.

00:28.460 --> 00:31.054
Unless people don't turn out.

00:32.460 --> 00:34.451
(siren chirps)

00:45.470 --> 00:48.132
"Racism without racist"?

00:48.180 --> 00:50.102
Excuse me?

00:50.150 --> 00:52.618
Oh, I'm just commenting on
the cheap shot taken at me

00:52.650 --> 00:54.311
at the Black Business
Leaders lunch.

00:54.350 --> 00:56.489
Really? You thought
that was cheap?

00:56.520 --> 00:58.181
Not for me.

00:58.220 --> 01:00.654
I lost key support in the
African-American community.

01:00.690 --> 01:02.385
It wasn't personal, Peter.

01:02.430 --> 01:04.250
Hmm.

01:04.290 --> 01:06.224
So, you don't personally
think I'm a racist,

01:06.260 --> 01:09.127
but saw a political advantage
in calling me a racist?

01:09.170 --> 01:10.592
I didn't specifically
call you a racist.

01:10.630 --> 01:13.531
You know, I see
little comfort in that.

01:13.570 --> 01:15.435
Let's just get
through this.

01:15.470 --> 01:19.236
Then we can get back to you
using me politically.

01:23.450 --> 01:25.202
Good morning.
Good to see you all.

01:25.250 --> 01:28.572
She's finally getting to vote
for her favorite Florrick.

01:28.620 --> 01:32.283
(laughter)

01:32.320 --> 01:34.515
* Oh, give me a home

01:34.560 --> 01:38.189
* Where the buffalo roam

01:38.230 --> 01:41.290
(gunshot)
* Where the deer

01:41.330 --> 01:46.290
(gunfire)
* And the antelope play

01:46.340 --> 01:49.468
* Where seldom is heard...

01:49.510 --> 01:50.909
REPORTER:
Mrs. Florrick and her husband

01:50.940 --> 01:52.703
Governor Peter Florrick
voted this morning.

01:52.740 --> 01:54.401
The first couple
looked confident

01:54.440 --> 01:56.908
even as public polls have shown
the race tightening.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.316
Across town, the resurgent
Prady campaign claim

01:59.350 --> 02:00.772
that their internals
(laughs)

02:00.820 --> 02:02.685
show the race in a dead heat.

02:02.720 --> 02:04.540
* Home

02:04.590 --> 02:08.708
* Home on the range

02:08.760 --> 02:11.558
* Where the deer...

02:11.590 --> 02:13.558
Whoa.

02:13.600 --> 02:17.161
Nicely done.

02:17.200 --> 02:19.191
Perfect way to scare off the
deer you don't want to hunt.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.663
Don't you mock me.
I'm holding a firearm.

02:22.740 --> 02:26.130
What?

02:27.840 --> 02:29.398
Oh.

02:29.450 --> 02:32.374
Most men prefer their wives
in garters and hose.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.844
You're late.

02:35.880 --> 02:37.313
R.D., good to see you again.

02:37.350 --> 02:39.511
This is my wife Diane.
Hello.

02:39.560 --> 02:40.754
Pleasure. _
These are your permits.

02:40.790 --> 02:42.382
Do not lose them, please.

02:42.430 --> 02:44.352
R.D. will be taking us
out to the blinds.

02:44.390 --> 02:45.254
Have you hunted before?

02:45.290 --> 02:46.496
No, first time.

02:46.530 --> 02:47.929
Marvelous.
Go get some grub,

02:47.960 --> 02:49.621
and we'll see you out there.

02:51.300 --> 02:52.858
So, this is the
top one percent

02:52.900 --> 02:54.595
of the top one percent
of the top one percent?

02:54.640 --> 02:57.234
We're not gonna talk
like communists here, okay?

02:57.270 --> 02:58.669
We discussed this.

02:58.710 --> 03:00.302
(laughs)
I don't know.

03:00.340 --> 03:03.377
I might start soliciting
for the ACLU.

03:03.410 --> 03:06.573
Your wife is
unpredictable that way.

03:06.620 --> 03:09.839
So, how did you get to know
all these billionaires aanay?

03:09.890 --> 03:11.585
R.D.

03:11.620 --> 03:13.451
They're nice guys.
You'll like them.
I like change.

03:13.490 --> 03:15.458
If I were to set off
a bomb in this room,

03:15.490 --> 03:17.583
we'd have democratic presidents
for the next 30 years.

03:17.630 --> 03:19.257
Okay, let's just keep
that to ourselves.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.291
(quiet laugh)

03:23.330 --> 03:24.365
Oh, my gosh.

03:24.400 --> 03:26.334
Is that Gil Berridge?

03:26.370 --> 03:28.634
McVEIGH:
No idea.

03:28.670 --> 03:30.661
He's the king
of Silicon Hills.

03:30.710 --> 03:33.474
The Mark Zuckerberg
of Austin, Texas.

03:33.510 --> 03:35.330
What's he do?

03:35.380 --> 03:36.278
DIANE:
At this point?

03:36.310 --> 03:37.846
Count his $25 billion.

03:37.880 --> 03:40.474
CARY:
Gil Berridge?

03:40.520 --> 03:42.408
Creator of the Kracker
Web browser?

03:42.450 --> 03:44.441
DIANE: He and his wife are in
the buffet line as we speak.

03:44.490 --> 03:46.378
My God, there must be
$400 million

03:46.420 --> 03:48.354
in legal fees
in that dining room.

03:48.390 --> 03:51.359
Wasn't there talk of Berridge
leaving Sewell & Augustine?

03:51.390 --> 03:53.699
I don't know, but landing him
would fill the Chumhum hole.

03:53.730 --> 03:55.357
Well, I am in Nowhere,
Wyoming,

03:55.400 --> 03:56.890
with him for the
next three days.

03:56.930 --> 03:58.727
A perfect chance
to pitch our firm.

03:58.770 --> 04:01.432
I just need to know why
he left Sewell & Augustine

04:01.470 --> 04:02.937
so I can play to that.

04:02.970 --> 04:04.369
We'll get back as soon
as we find something.

04:04.410 --> 04:07.038
Okay. We'll talk.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.640
Hon, when we're out there

04:09.680 --> 04:11.739
we'll be divided up
into blinds, right?

04:11.780 --> 04:14.772
Yes, two person blind. Why?

04:14.820 --> 04:18.278
It would be really helpful
to have a captive audience.

04:21.860 --> 04:24.454
I thought we said three
days no work, just fun.

04:24.490 --> 04:25.752
We did.

04:25.790 --> 04:27.291
This is fun.

04:27.330 --> 04:28.752
Aren't you having fun?

04:28.800 --> 04:30.062
You hunt deer.

04:30.100 --> 04:31.328
I hunt clients.

04:31.370 --> 04:32.894
Mm, but which head

04:32.940 --> 04:35.329
are we gonna mount
over the fireplace?

04:35.370 --> 04:36.439
Here, have one.

04:36.470 --> 04:38.631
They're good. Nature's treat.

04:38.670 --> 04:41.468
Okay, uh, there's nothing
more for you to do today.

04:41.510 --> 04:43.774
So, sit back, take a nap, just
try to stay fresh for tonight.

04:46.350 --> 04:48.318
Alicia, you can have one.

04:48.350 --> 04:50.443
I'll keep you posted
throughout the day.

04:50.490 --> 04:53.482
We should have some sense
of the turnout by noon,

04:53.520 --> 04:54.817
but the official exit polling
won't be until 4:00.

04:54.860 --> 04:56.350
Oh, my God!

04:56.390 --> 04:57.982
Sugar in my brain.

04:58.030 --> 04:59.327
I know, Cool, right?
(doorbell rings)

04:59.360 --> 05:00.452
Uh, how are
your speeches coming?

05:00.500 --> 05:02.525
Good.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.526
I've already written
my acceptance speech.

05:04.570 --> 05:07.937
I mean, I heard it was bad luck
to write a concession speech.

05:10.570 --> 05:12.060
Finn!
Hey!

05:12.110 --> 05:14.533
I, uh, I didn't think
that you'd be here.

05:14.580 --> 05:16.946
I was going to leave this
for you at the door.

05:16.980 --> 05:20.416
I just, uh, wanted
to wish you good luck.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.418
Thank you.
Do you want to come in?

05:22.450 --> 05:24.008
Would you like a donut?

05:24.050 --> 05:25.540
Uh, no. But thanks. Hey.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.085
Jon, you know Finn.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.054
Yes, it's good to see you again.

05:30.090 --> 05:32.854
Uh, yeah, it's, uh,
for Alicia for today.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.424
Okay, um...
I'd better go.

05:34.460 --> 05:35.597
I'm gonna call you
in a few hours.

05:35.630 --> 05:37.393
Okay. Thanks.

05:37.430 --> 05:38.761
Can I open this now?

05:38.800 --> 05:41.098
Yeah! Kind of the whole point.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.569
A friend of mine

05:45.610 --> 05:47.771
gave me one of those while I was
waiting for a jury verdict.

05:47.810 --> 05:49.869
_ It turns out the
first-person shooter game

05:49.910 --> 05:51.548
is exactly what I needed.

05:51.580 --> 05:53.411
Oh, Hal That's a good one!
Yeah!

05:53.450 --> 05:55.611
(cell phone rings)
One second.

05:55.650 --> 05:57.481
Hello?

05:57.520 --> 05:58.782
MAN:
Mrs. Florrick, I just wanted

05:58.820 --> 06:00.481
to wish you good luck today.

06:00.520 --> 06:01.885
Oh, well, thank you.

06:01.920 --> 06:03.126
I'm sorry. Who is this?

06:03.160 --> 06:05.754
It's Lemond.

06:05.790 --> 06:07.121
Bishop.

06:07.160 --> 06:08.718
Oh.

06:08.760 --> 06:11.729
Um... thank you, sir.

06:11.770 --> 06:13.067
I'm sorry, but it is, uh,

06:13.100 --> 06:15.489
a very busy day
and I have to go.

06:27.650 --> 06:29.072
Dylan?

06:29.120 --> 06:30.883
Why don't you wait for
Kalinda in the other room?

06:30.920 --> 06:32.911
Sure, Dad.

06:37.660 --> 06:38.820
Is everything
all right, Mr. Bishop?

06:38.860 --> 06:41.590
I don't know.

06:41.630 --> 06:44.724
I put a lot of money
into Alicia's campaign.

06:44.770 --> 06:47.091
I didn't do it because
I'm a nice guy.

06:47.140 --> 06:50.667
I know Alicia needs to
keep me at arm's length.

06:50.710 --> 06:53.099
For appearance sake.

06:53.140 --> 06:54.835
But I will still need her help

06:54.880 --> 06:56.848
when I need her help.

06:56.880 --> 06:59.769
If Alicia wins,
she's leaving the law firm.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.117
Yes, and going

07:01.150 --> 07:02.845
to the S.A.'s office.

07:02.890 --> 07:05.188
Yeah.

07:05.220 --> 07:08.610
I'm gonna need you
to be the go-between

07:08.660 --> 07:10.651
for the two of us, Kalinda.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.756
I'm sorry, sir.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.768
I don't think I can do that.

07:16.800 --> 07:19.997
Yes, you can.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.735
All right.
Good.

07:21.770 --> 07:24.068
(clears throat)

07:24.110 --> 07:25.907
Done.

07:25.940 --> 07:27.874
Oh, God, you're good to me.

07:27.910 --> 07:30.071
(tapping glass)
GIL: IfI could
have your attention.

07:30.110 --> 07:31.907
Hello.
(laughs)

07:31.950 --> 07:33.577
It's good to see you all
again this year.

07:33.620 --> 07:34.541
It's been an interesting year.

07:34.580 --> 07:36.218
We've had our ups and downs.

07:36.250 --> 07:38.184
The Republican Senate.

07:38.220 --> 07:41.553
(all cheering)

07:41.590 --> 07:43.581
Now you know what it's like
for me among your friends.

07:43.630 --> 07:46.190
To celebrate this historic turn
I have a gift for the group.

07:46.230 --> 07:47.595
Sacrificing welfare virgins?

07:47.630 --> 07:49.257
I know our wives
have been left

07:49.300 --> 07:53.066
to _their own devices over
this long manly weekend

07:53.100 --> 07:54.533
of testosterone-heavy
blood lust.

07:54.570 --> 07:56.606
(laughter)
But... no more.

07:56.640 --> 08:00.576
I bought our lovely ladies
a spa day.

08:00.610 --> 08:02.840
Ladies, if you'd be
so kind as to follow

08:02.880 --> 08:04.279
Darla through the lobby.

08:04.310 --> 08:05.242
Uh, now, where's Darla?
There she is.

08:05.280 --> 08:06.508
Wave your hand, Darla.

08:06.550 --> 08:08.245
Like hell I'm going.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.487
Coming, buddy?

08:12.320 --> 08:13.685
I'll talk to you, hon.

08:13.720 --> 08:15.517
Are you freaking serious?!

08:15.560 --> 08:17.755
You can chase him tonight
at dinner.
You're seriously thinking

08:17.790 --> 08:20.099
of leaving me alone with
all these Republican women?

08:20.130 --> 08:22.860
I love you, and I'll bring
you home an antlered buck.

08:22.900 --> 08:25.562
Oh... this is... sexist!

08:25.600 --> 08:28.194
(women laughing)

08:28.240 --> 08:30.959
Oh, dear God.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.875
PETER:
What can I say?

08:32.910 --> 08:35.299
I am a proud husband
and an even prouder governor.

08:35.340 --> 08:38.002
You look fonNard to working with
your wife if she gets elected?

08:38.050 --> 08:40.678
As long as I don't get
on her bad side.

08:40.720 --> 08:43.780
I don't know if you've noticed,
but Alicia can be pretty tough.

08:43.820 --> 08:45.242
Uh, Mandy, the governor has
a very busy day.

08:45.290 --> 08:46.712
Are we nearly done here?
No, no, no.

08:46.760 --> 08:47.784
That's-that's all right, Eli.

08:47.820 --> 08:48.787
Let her do her job.

08:48.820 --> 08:50.287
You know, all those years,

08:50.330 --> 08:51.957
I was out running for office,

08:51.990 --> 08:54.220
Alicia was the one that held
the family together.

08:54.260 --> 08:56.626
Now, she is committed,
she's focused

08:56.670 --> 08:58.592
and she's gonna be an excellent

08:58.630 --> 09:00.188
state's attorney.
Oh, you're speaking

09:00.240 --> 09:01.935
very confidently.
Think she has a good shot?

09:01.970 --> 09:03.631
The precincts have barely
started reporting.

09:03.670 --> 09:04.932
We're a long way away.
Well, as far

09:04.970 --> 09:07.029
as I'm concerned,
you can take it to the bank.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.877
There's no question
in my mind.

09:08.910 --> 09:10.207
Alicia Florrick is going
to be the next

09:10.250 --> 09:11.979
state's attorney
for Cook County.

09:12.010 --> 09:13.341
What in the freaking
bloody hell is he doing?

09:13.380 --> 09:15.848
He just slaughtered us like
blah-blah-blah cattle!

09:15.880 --> 09:18.019
Okay, so we set up your avatar.
ALICIA: Wow!

09:18.050 --> 09:19.187
I look good.
(cell phone ringing)

09:19.220 --> 09:20.653
Yeah, every girl's
bra size increases

09:20.690 --> 09:22.009
a letter when they
become an avatar.

09:22.060 --> 09:24.028
Hey, Jon, what's up?

09:24.060 --> 09:26.324
Well, to be honest,
your husband is up.

09:26.360 --> 09:28.590
How do I make her shoot?
There. That button on the side.

09:28.630 --> 09:30.689
He just went off-script
in an interview today.

09:30.730 --> 09:32.061
He said you were definitely
gonna be the next

09:32.100 --> 09:33.328
state's attorney.
ALICIA: Okay, good.

09:33.370 --> 09:34.359
No, not good.

09:34.400 --> 09:37.005
Uh... Jon, I don't think

09:37.040 --> 09:38.200
I'm getting...

09:38.240 --> 09:39.332
He just depressed turnout,
Alicia.

09:39.370 --> 09:40.302
He said you were a slam dunk

09:40.340 --> 09:42.205
to be the next state's attorney.

09:42.240 --> 09:43.673
He just told every voter
in Cook County that

09:43.710 --> 09:45.769
they don't have
to come out to the polls!

09:45.810 --> 09:47.869
Oh.
Yeah. "Oh."

09:47.920 --> 09:49.615
He just screwed you.

09:49.650 --> 09:51.914
You're five points up,
but only if they vote.

09:51.950 --> 09:53.349
Only if they come out.

09:53.390 --> 09:55.688
If they stay home,
if they think you're secure?

09:55.720 --> 09:56.926
You will lose.

09:56.960 --> 09:58.621
Alicia, do you hear me?
Yes.

09:58.660 --> 10:01.356
Why is he doing this?

10:01.400 --> 10:02.867
I don't know.

10:02.900 --> 10:04.322
We set up three more interviews
with him today.

10:04.370 --> 10:06.395
He can't keep saying this.
I'll talk to him.

10:06.430 --> 10:08.762
Can he walk it back?
I don't know that he can.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.108
I don't know, but remember

10:10.140 --> 10:11.960
when I told you
I think we're good?

10:12.010 --> 10:13.739
Yeah.

10:13.780 --> 10:14.974
We're not good.

10:39.100 --> 10:41.159
PETER: Gentlemen, again,
congratulations.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.100
And thank you for your

10:43.140 --> 10:45.335
years of service.

10:48.110 --> 10:49.771
Well, what are you doing here?

10:49.810 --> 10:51.243
I thought you'd be
holed up at home.

10:51.280 --> 10:53.748
I was until I_saw _
your Mandy Post InterVIew.

10:53.780 --> 10:56.271
Okay, let's just take this
through here, shall we?

10:56.320 --> 10:58.686
Just move it through here.

11:00.420 --> 11:01.717
Well, you look unhappy

11:01.760 --> 11:03.079
so I must have done
something wrong.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.882
Oh, come on, Peter,
you know what you did.

11:04.930 --> 11:06.283
Well, I know that I gave
you a rave as a leader

11:06.330 --> 11:07.922
and as a great decider.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.029
I also know
that on a day

11:09.060 --> 11:10.960
that I was supposed to be
talking about pensions,

11:11.000 --> 11:12.968
I'm doing crime-related
photo ops to help you.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.935
So what else did I do?
"You can take it
to the bank.

11:15.970 --> 11:18.768
My wife is going to be
the next state's attorney"?
Yes, she is.

11:18.810 --> 11:20.778
You've read the polls.
What's going on,
Peter?

11:20.810 --> 11:22.300
Why are you pretending
you didn't know what you did?

11:22.340 --> 11:24.001
I do know what I did, and
it was all about you, I...

11:24.050 --> 11:26.177
Alicia, I think we should
take this out to the car.

11:26.210 --> 11:28.212
It's depressing
the turnout.
Oh, that's nonsense.

11:28.250 --> 11:30.946
I mean, that's political
handler speak.
It is not.

11:30.990 --> 11:31.843
Who told you that?

11:31.890 --> 11:33.778
Elfman, to
sound clever?

11:33.820 --> 11:35.879
People don't come out to vote
if they think you've won.

11:35.920 --> 11:38.718
They read the polls;
everybody reads the polls.

11:38.760 --> 11:39.920
Not the polls
we're seeing.

11:39.960 --> 11:41.393
Everyone knows
you're ahead.

11:41.430 --> 11:42.863
I haven't said anything
that is not true.

11:42.900 --> 11:44.299
You remember that?
The truth?

11:46.370 --> 11:48.031
You don't want me to win.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.866
I don't want you to win?

11:51.910 --> 11:52.899
(chuckles)

11:52.940 --> 11:53.929
Really?

11:53.980 --> 11:55.936
Yes, I suddenly
just realized.

11:55.980 --> 11:58.801
You_ want_ to be _
the only wmner In the family.

11:58.850 --> 12:00.875
Alicia, I have done nothing
for the last three months

12:00.920 --> 12:02.842
but work to get
you elected.

12:02.890 --> 12:03.948
Yes, like banging
Ramona.

12:03.990 --> 12:05.412
Okay, let's
discuss this...

12:05.450 --> 12:07.156
When you specifically
promised me that you wouldn't.

12:07.190 --> 12:08.452
Look, is that what's
bothering you?

12:08.490 --> 12:11.027
Then just say it.
Just say it.
I did just say it.

12:11.060 --> 12:12.994
You promised me you wouldn't
see her anymore.
All right,
don't psychoanalyze me.

12:13.030 --> 12:15.999
I'm not psychoanalyzing
you.
Then give me credit
for being a fan.

12:16.030 --> 12:17.918
For thinking that you'd actually
be a great state's attorney.

12:17.970 --> 12:19.938
I am giving you credit
for your political smarts.

12:19.970 --> 12:21.892
ALICIA: You know when you
go off-message.
PETER: No, no, no, I did not...

12:21.940 --> 12:22.929
You know when you
purposefully...
I did not go off-message.

12:22.970 --> 12:24.801
I'm the governor,
I have to say what I think.

12:24.840 --> 12:26.102
Yes, but you don't just say
the first thing that comes

12:26.140 --> 12:28.176
to your mind, Peter.
Look, if you don't
like what I'm saying,

12:28.210 --> 12:30.178
then don't come to me with
all your problems to fIx.

12:30.210 --> 12:32.007
Okay.

12:32.050 --> 12:33.449
I won't.

12:33.480 --> 12:35.448
And don't do any more
interviews today.

12:35.480 --> 12:36.913
Eli, you cancel
the next two.

12:36.950 --> 12:38.941
Great, gives me time
to serve my state!

12:44.230 --> 12:48.155
The thing is, the employment
statistics are misleading

12:48.200 --> 12:50.395
because everybody's only
working part-time.

12:50.430 --> 12:52.398
Because of
Obamacare.

12:52.430 --> 12:54.034
(cell phone rings)
And that's not even
counting the people

12:54.070 --> 12:55.867
who've stopped
looking for work.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.061
Which is why the unemployment
numbers are so low.

12:58.110 --> 12:59.065
Oh.

12:59.110 --> 13:00.577
Cary.

13:00.610 --> 13:02.373
CARY:
It was his wife.
What?

13:02.410 --> 13:03.968
Gil Berridge left
Sewell & Augustine

13:04.010 --> 13:05.375
because his wife
convmced hIm

13:05.410 --> 13:08.379
they weren't attuned to the
needs of a tech prodigy.

13:08.420 --> 13:10.388
He's henpecked--
he does anything she says

13:10.420 --> 13:11.580
just to shut her up.

13:11.620 --> 13:13.258
She's there, right?

13:13.290 --> 13:15.053
She's about ten feet
away from me,

13:15.090 --> 13:17.058
waiting to get
her toes done.

13:17.090 --> 13:18.455
I'll call you back.

13:18.490 --> 13:20.094
DAVID: Get the wife,
and you get the husband.

13:20.130 --> 13:21.529
Right.

13:24.170 --> 13:25.319
Hi, Diane.

13:25.370 --> 13:27.338
Georgette.

13:27.370 --> 13:30.305
You were the_one who wanted
to go shooting, aren't you?

13:30.340 --> 13:31.932
(chuckles)
Yep.

13:31.970 --> 13:33.506
Silly me.
Yeah.

13:33.540 --> 13:35.508
It's a lot of cigars and
corporate loophole talk.

13:35.540 --> 13:37.007
Mm.

13:37.050 --> 13:38.847
Why don't you
sit on down?
Oh.

13:38.880 --> 13:40.279
Well, you're a tall
one, aren't you?

13:40.320 --> 13:41.947
Oh, thank you.

13:41.980 --> 13:43.345
I saw you and Gil
at breakfast.

13:43.390 --> 13:46.041
I, um, meant to stop over
and say hello.

13:46.090 --> 13:47.284
Do you know Gil?

13:47.320 --> 13:49.117
No, I know Jim Sewell,
Mm.

13:49.160 --> 13:51.128
his former attorney.

13:51.160 --> 13:52.991
Right, he's not
with them anymore.
Yeah, I heard.

13:53.030 --> 13:54.998
That's probably
a smart move.

13:55.030 --> 13:57.021
Um, not a good fit
for a tech firm.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.992
So you're a
lawyer, too, then?

13:59.030 --> 14:01.498
Is it that obvious?

14:01.540 --> 14:02.598
No, you're not Jewish.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.232
Gil hates all
the Jews around.

14:04.270 --> 14:07.068
He's not anti:Semitic
or anything.

14:07.110 --> 14:08.600
It's just...

14:08.640 --> 14:10.244
I used to date
a Jewish guy,

14:10.280 --> 14:12.271
and I think he gets
a little jealous.

14:15.950 --> 14:17.281
So I heard you have
a lot of sway with Gil.

14:17.320 --> 14:18.912
Oh?

14:18.950 --> 14:20.110
Who said that?

14:20.160 --> 14:22.014
Darla? She's a bitch.

14:22.060 --> 14:23.880
Oh, he's just a man,

14:23.930 --> 14:25.886
and men really secretly
want to be manipulated.

14:25.930 --> 14:28.091
Where's your
firm, anyway?

14:28.130 --> 14:29.392
Chicago.

14:29.430 --> 14:31.022
I love Chicago.

14:31.070 --> 14:32.628
Really?

14:37.610 --> 14:39.566
DYLAN: I wanted
to go to Disney World,

14:39.610 --> 14:41.430
but my dad said
maybe next time.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.072
But we went swimming
one day,

14:43.110 --> 14:45.078
_and there was
a wmdow under water.

14:45.110 --> 14:46.042
In the pool.

14:46.080 --> 14:48.219
I wanted to go to it,

14:48.250 --> 14:50.639
but my dad said I couldn't
because it was a bar.

14:54.290 --> 14:57.259
Dylan, could you listen to your
music for a second, please?

14:57.290 --> 14:58.552
Why?
Please.

14:58.590 --> 15:00.126
Just for a second.

15:00.160 --> 15:02.196
(phone auto-dialing)

15:02.230 --> 15:04.198
(muffled music playing)
(line ringing)

15:04.230 --> 15:05.390
BISHOP:
Yeah?

15:05.430 --> 15:08.035
Uh, it's behind me.

15:08.070 --> 15:09.332
Two occupants:

15:09.370 --> 15:11.167
one black, one white.

15:11.210 --> 15:12.700
Right, I see it.

15:12.740 --> 15:14.708
I'm behind it.

15:14.740 --> 15:17.379
This is what I need you
to do, Kalinda.

15:17.410 --> 15:20.072
You see the light up ahead?

15:20.120 --> 15:21.178
Stop at it.

15:21.220 --> 15:22.676
Don't move when it turns green.

15:22.720 --> 15:24.119
Don't hang up.

15:24.150 --> 15:25.219
All right.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.279
(muffled music continues)

15:35.360 --> 15:38.090
(over phone): Now. Now.
(car honks)

15:41.440 --> 15:44.068
(horn honking)

15:46.740 --> 15:49.106
MAN:
Get out of the car now!
Now, move It!

15:49.140 --> 15:51.074
BISHOP: You can go, Kalinda.
Take Dylan to school.

15:51.110 --> 15:53.214
Is-is everything all right, sir?

15:53.250 --> 15:55.115
It is now.

15:55.150 --> 15:56.981
Put 'em in the back.

16:03.660 --> 16:05.184
NEWSCASTER:
Three hours into voting,

16:05.230 --> 16:07.596
and the lines at the polls
are getting crowded.

16:07.630 --> 16:09.222
All signs point to this being
a tight race.

16:09.260 --> 16:11.160
Both camps expressed confidence

16:11.200 --> 16:12.326
as they calmly wait
for exit polls.

16:12.370 --> 16:13.337
...really soon.
We've been
here before.

16:13.370 --> 16:14.530
This problem
is growing

16:14.570 --> 16:16.060
It's not too late,
by the minute.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.761
and we need to
walk it back.
Alicia.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.766
I talked to Peter,
we're canceling the interviews.

16:19.810 --> 16:21.038
Good.
No.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.172
He needs
to walk it back.

16:22.210 --> 16:23.302
We need to get him
to walk it back.

16:23.350 --> 16:25.045
Where, Josh? Where
is he gonna do that?

16:25.080 --> 16:27.241
Let's not make this Alic_ia's
problem-- you two deCIde.

16:27.280 --> 16:29.077
A robocall, you know,
a-a blah-blah.

16:29.120 --> 16:31.042
It's not too late.
It's never too...

16:31.090 --> 16:31.988
No, it'll look like
a desperate move.
It is a desperate move.

16:32.020 --> 16:33.282
ALICIA: What are we talking
about here?

16:33.320 --> 16:34.355
Would you stop talking
to each other

16:34.390 --> 16:36.358
and start talking
to me?

16:36.390 --> 16:38.529
First of all,
I need to say

16:38.560 --> 16:41.358
your apartment
is beautiful.

16:41.400 --> 16:44.198
Thank you.

16:44.230 --> 16:46.198
I just got married, I'm hiring
a contractor.
Okay, the
turnout's depressed.

16:46.230 --> 16:47.663
We're losing a third
of your voters.

16:47.700 --> 16:49.099
You know that already?

16:49.140 --> 16:50.539
Yes, it's throwing
off my models,

16:50.570 --> 16:52.231
and your precincts
are the worst hit.
So I'm losrng.

16:52.270 --> 16:54.238
Well, your margin of error
wasn't so blah-blah-blah.

16:54.280 --> 16:55.474
Yes, yes, you're losing.

16:55.510 --> 16:57.671
And if turnout is this low in
the 'burbs, Prady will win.

16:57.710 --> 17:00.372
Is there anything Alicia
can do about it at this point?

17:00.420 --> 17:01.569
In terms of
turnout, no.

17:01.620 --> 17:03.087
Then come_ with me.
Walt.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.485
W-Wait, we'll need
her input.

17:04.520 --> 17:06.511
When you want her input,
come get us.

17:08.360 --> 17:11.158
Who can we get
to do a robocall, hmm?

17:11.190 --> 17:12.452
We still have
the after-work voters,

17:12.490 --> 17:14.299
the 6:00 to 8:00 voters.

17:14.330 --> 17:15.649
Or we could work on
depressing Prady's votes.

17:15.700 --> 17:18.567
How?
I have to talk
to Peter.

17:18.600 --> 17:20.568
Come on, hold that.

17:20.600 --> 17:23.160
You know, the problem
isn't even losing.

17:23.210 --> 17:26.168
It's the wasted time.

17:26.210 --> 17:27.802
And Peter.

17:27.840 --> 17:29.808
Why encourage me to
run if you're just...

17:29.840 --> 17:32.775
Okay, you're JusticeGal,
and I'm Badass Kicka'.

17:32.810 --> 17:34.311
What?

17:34.350 --> 17:35.317
Your avatar.

17:35.350 --> 17:36.612
See, you're the one on top.

17:37.620 --> 17:40.157
Push the joystick.

17:40.190 --> 17:42.078
Why?
To kill me.

17:44.690 --> 17:46.282
You missed.
Marissa,

17:46.330 --> 17:49.356
I don't want to do
this right now.
Yes, you do.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.061
Now, I'm gonna
shoot at you.

17:52.830 --> 17:55.196
Hey.
Yeah, you better fight,
or I'll kill you.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.663
(gunfire)

17:57.710 --> 17:58.506
(laughing)

17:58.540 --> 18:00.838
Uh, yoo-hoo.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.677
Can you get something
stronger in these babies?

18:02.710 --> 18:03.779
Uh, bourbon.

18:03.810 --> 18:05.243
Yeah, a small-batch.

18:05.280 --> 18:06.679
(cell phone rings)

18:06.710 --> 18:08.268
Bring us the private
reserve, the good stuff.

18:08.320 --> 18:10.584
Oh, um, excuse me,
Georgette.

18:12.590 --> 18:15.354
So how is hunting
and gathering going?

18:15.390 --> 18:16.687
McVEIGH:
Good.

18:16.720 --> 18:17.880
Listen, I need a favor.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.886
I forgot my rifle
in the bedroom.

18:19.930 --> 18:22.524
You... I thought I saw you leave
with your rifle?

18:22.560 --> 18:24.528
Yes, I did.

18:24.570 --> 18:26.219
But I brought the wrong one.

18:26.270 --> 18:28.261
I need the 26-inch barrel.

18:30.670 --> 18:33.275
This is you being nice to me.

18:33.310 --> 18:36.700
I don't know, but Mr. Berridge
and I are here in the blind,

18:36.740 --> 18:38.605
and we need
the proper weaponry.

18:38.650 --> 18:41.619
There are no words
for how much I love you.

18:41.650 --> 18:43.618
So then I'll see you soon?

18:43.650 --> 18:45.242
I'm on my way.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.258
(school bell rings)

18:47.290 --> 18:48.655
Hello, Mrs. Bishop?

18:48.690 --> 18:50.248
How are you doing?

18:50.290 --> 18:51.757
Actually,
I'm not Mrs. Bishop.

18:51.790 --> 18:53.758
Tabitha Gray, head of
the parent's committee.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.155
I've never seen
you at meetings.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.827
Uh, I just wanted to know
if everything's all right.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.326
Everything's fine.

18:59.370 --> 19:00.632
Because I saw what
happened back there,

19:00.670 --> 19:02.661
on the way to school,
with your husband.

19:02.700 --> 19:05.362
Everything's all right,
but thank you very much.

19:05.410 --> 19:07.378
It-it looked like those men
were dragged from their car...

19:07.410 --> 19:08.809
I have to go. Bye.

19:08.840 --> 19:11.445
(engine starts)

19:13.920 --> 19:15.876
ALICIA:
Hey, why are you
picking on me?

19:15.920 --> 19:17.888
Because you keep
exposing yourself.

19:17.920 --> 19:19.217
Use the barriers.

19:19.250 --> 19:20.854
Who's that?

19:20.890 --> 19:22.653
I don't know--
shoot him.

19:22.690 --> 19:23.918
Ah! He's shooting at me--
shoot him.

19:23.960 --> 19:25.655
Who is he?
Some bad guy-- kill him!

19:25.690 --> 19:27.521
MAN: What do we got here,
couple of virgins?

19:27.560 --> 19:29.357
Oh, who is he?

19:29.400 --> 19:30.560
Someone's talking in my head.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.568
I'm your worst nightmare, lady.

19:32.600 --> 19:35.262
Keith, from Idaho.
Well, watch this,
Keith from Idaho.

19:35.300 --> 19:37.507
JOHNNY: Alicia, do you have
a minute?
Well, she's a bit
tied down right now, guys.

19:37.540 --> 19:40.373
JOSH: Well, we need an answer
on something, crazy lady.
What?

19:40.410 --> 19:41.479
We're thinking about
putting out a robocall

19:41.510 --> 19:42.534
to get your people
out to vote.

19:42.580 --> 19:44.673
We think we can get the
after-work voters riled up,

19:44.710 --> 19:45.904
and they'll come out
for you.

19:45.950 --> 19:47.679
(avatar screaming)
ALICIA: Damn it.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.915
Oh, really? A-Are you sure
you have time for this now?

19:49.950 --> 19:51.383
You want me to do the robocall?

19:51.420 --> 19:53.411
No, it's not
about you.

19:53.460 --> 19:55.758
We want to suggest that one of
the initiatives is in trouble

19:55.790 --> 19:57.382
unless people come out
and vote for it.
Which one?

19:57.430 --> 19:59.421
The privatization
of parking meters.

20:01.430 --> 20:03.421
People won't come out
if I'm losing,

20:03.470 --> 20:05.859
but they'll come out
if parking meters are losing?

20:05.900 --> 20:07.936
Yes, because it
costs them money.

20:07.970 --> 20:09.938
Didn't Daley sell Chicago's soul
to the parking meter gods?

20:09.970 --> 20:12.302
Yes, for a billion dollars
in return.

20:12.340 --> 20:13.602
God, there is something
truly sad about...

20:13.640 --> 20:14.732
Die, scumbag!

20:14.780 --> 20:16.634
JOSH:
Not if we use it.

20:16.680 --> 20:19.877
We just need you to get Peter
on board to do this robocall?

20:19.910 --> 20:22.470
JOHNNY:
Right now, the initiative
is winning by six points.

20:22.520 --> 20:24.488
We just need Peter to convince
people that it's losing by six.

20:24.520 --> 20:26.408
He won't do it.
He will if he knows
you're gonna lose.

20:26.450 --> 20:29.578
That's why he won't.
JOSH: Alicia, we are
at that point

20:29.620 --> 20:31.759
where you can lose the election.
ALICIA: I know.

20:31.790 --> 20:34.429
And I'm the last person
Peter will do it for.

20:34.460 --> 20:35.825
Okay, we need someone
that people implicitly trust

20:35.860 --> 20:36.895
to record a call for us.

20:36.930 --> 20:38.488
What about
what's-his-name?

20:38.530 --> 20:39.565
Uh, uh, uh,
the oatmeal guy?

20:39.600 --> 20:40.567
BIah-blah-blah?

20:40.600 --> 20:41.760
The Quaker?

20:41.800 --> 20:42.892
No, no, I eat oatmeal.

20:42.940 --> 20:44.737
I'm old,
and I eat oatmeal.

20:44.770 --> 20:45.839
Wilford Brimley?
JOSH:
Yes.

20:45.870 --> 20:46.837
Uh, isn't he dead?

20:46.870 --> 20:48.428
Or the president.

20:48.480 --> 20:49.469
Obama?!
JOSH:
No.

20:49.510 --> 20:50.647
Him, the... come on.

20:50.680 --> 20:51.908
Why am I the only one
thinking here?

20:51.950 --> 20:52.939
Martin Sheen?

20:52.980 --> 20:54.470
Yeah.
Oh, my God.

20:54.520 --> 20:56.374
It's scaring me--
I'm on his wavelength now.

20:56.420 --> 20:57.580
Well, we better call
someone, 'cause we've got

20:57.620 --> 20:58.609
two hours to record
and air a call.

20:58.650 --> 21:00.288
(vehicle approaching)

21:00.320 --> 21:03.551
MAN (over walkie-talkie):
ATV from the north 50 feet.

21:03.590 --> 21:05.285
Roger, standing down.

21:05.330 --> 21:06.558
McVEIGH:
Hey, Gil,

21:06.590 --> 21:08.399
my wife, Diane Lockhart.

21:08.430 --> 21:11.024
Diane, you remember
Gil and RD.

21:11.070 --> 21:12.560
Mr. Berridge.

21:12.600 --> 21:13.828
Ma'am.

21:13.870 --> 21:15.064
Hi.

21:15.100 --> 21:16.499
Is that the
one you want?

21:16.540 --> 21:18.007
Yep, that's her.

21:18.040 --> 21:20.600
Oh, and I was told by
the driver to tell you

21:20.640 --> 21:22.039
that the deer are
being flushed.

21:22.080 --> 21:23.547
Although, I don't
know what that means.

21:23.580 --> 21:24.842
It means the hunting's
about to get good.

21:24.880 --> 21:25.847
Will you join us?

21:25.880 --> 21:27.006
Oh, you don't mind?

21:27.050 --> 21:28.574
Please.
Oh, great.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.315
Is this your first time?

21:30.350 --> 21:32.011
Uh, shooting
anything alive, yes.

21:32.050 --> 21:33.756
Well, don't worry, we won't
make you drink the blood.

21:33.790 --> 21:37.556
(laughing)

21:37.590 --> 21:39.626
Georgette warned me about,
uh, your sense of humor.

21:39.660 --> 21:41.457
She said the way
to get at your good side

21:41.500 --> 21:42.592
is to get you laughing.

21:44.070 --> 21:45.628
Is that how we get
on your good side?

21:45.670 --> 21:46.591
I didn't know
I had a good side.

21:46.630 --> 21:48.632
(chuckles)
Yeah.

21:48.670 --> 21:50.706
Georgette said that you were
looking for a new firm.

21:50.740 --> 21:52.708
A law firm?

21:52.740 --> 21:55.106
Really? Uh, what else
was Georgette saying?

21:55.140 --> 21:57.449
Well, that you needed
a bigger firm,

21:57.480 --> 22:00.517
one with deeper connections
in politics.

22:00.550 --> 22:03.348
And she was happy to hear
we no longer represent Chumhum.

22:03.390 --> 22:05.346
And she told me how much,
uh, she loves Chicago.

22:05.390 --> 22:06.584
I'm sorry to be rude--

22:06.620 --> 22:07.655
I'm gonna stop
you right there.

22:07.690 --> 22:08.679
Diane, boys...

22:08.720 --> 22:10.358
Uh, if you'll excuse me,

22:10.390 --> 22:11.652
I think I might have
a better line of sight

22:11.690 --> 22:13.658
from another blind.
Oh.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.656
Well, is everything all right?
Yes. Uh...

22:15.700 --> 22:16.951
Ijust like trading blinds.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.399
Yeah, I'm good.

22:18.430 --> 22:19.624
Can you call out
the all-clear, R.D.?

22:19.670 --> 22:22.696
Roger. Hunter moving blinds,
stand down.

22:22.740 --> 22:23.707
MAN (over radio):
Rogen

22:23.740 --> 22:24.707
Did I say something wrong?

22:24.740 --> 22:25.866
R.D.?

22:25.910 --> 22:27.138
Uh, well,

22:27.170 --> 22:28.671
I can think of one thing.

22:28.710 --> 22:30.849
Uh, Georgette isn't his wife.

22:30.880 --> 22:33.041
Uh, she's his call girl.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.552
(birds calling)

22:47.530 --> 22:49.054
R.D.:
Kurt's talking to Gil

22:49.100 --> 22:50.829
in the eastern blind.

22:50.870 --> 22:51.996
Everything's fine.

22:52.030 --> 22:53.998
He might even come back.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.894
I didn't know.

22:55.940 --> 22:58.761
She didn't seem like
she was... working.

22:58.810 --> 23:00.163
We've been letting Gil
get away with that

23:00.210 --> 23:01.700
for a few years now.

23:01.740 --> 23:02.968
He said he could
bring either a...

23:03.010 --> 23:04.807
a call girl or
a Democrat.

23:04.850 --> 23:07.375
People voted, said they'd
rather the call girl.

23:08.880 --> 23:10.438
That was a joke, right?

23:10.490 --> 23:12.640
No.

23:14.790 --> 23:18.180
Well, was there
a vote about me?

23:18.230 --> 23:19.982
What about you?

23:20.030 --> 23:22.021
Being a Democrat?

23:24.570 --> 23:26.788
(chuckles)

23:26.830 --> 23:29.162
Well...

23:29.200 --> 23:30.804
I suppose
your husband's

23:30.840 --> 23:32.660
conservative enough
for the both of you.

23:32.710 --> 23:33.904
Want one?

23:33.940 --> 23:34.975
Oh.

23:35.010 --> 23:37.877
Thank you.

23:37.910 --> 23:39.844
So what should
we talk about?

23:39.880 --> 23:41.814
Killing babies?

23:43.550 --> 23:44.744
Sure. Why the hell not?

23:44.790 --> 23:46.815
We both have rifles.

23:46.850 --> 23:48.454
Let's see what comes of this.

23:50.530 --> 23:52.828
MARISSA:
Kick that weapon to me.
I'm going to the top

23:52.860 --> 23:54.225
of that building.
There's ammunition up there.

23:54.260 --> 23:55.955
Where is the rest of our team?
I need help here.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.888
Hey, watch out.
Behind you! To the left!

23:57.930 --> 24:00.091
(avatar screams)
Hey, we got a
friendly here.

24:00.130 --> 24:01.939
He just saved you.
Thanks.

24:01.970 --> 24:02.891
Who is it?

24:02.940 --> 24:04.760
MARISSA:
"Coolbeans."

24:04.810 --> 24:05.731
Thanks, Coolbeans.

24:05.770 --> 24:06.907
We got some nerds

24:06.940 --> 24:08.578
from Seattle after us.
Want to run with us?

24:08.610 --> 24:10.100
COOLBEANS (over headset):
Sure. This way.

24:10.140 --> 24:12.199
Hey, I've been here before;
stay to the left.

24:12.250 --> 24:13.808
Finn?

24:13.850 --> 24:15.738
Hey, JusticeGirl.

24:15.780 --> 24:17.919
You know, you're racking up
some pretty good kills.

24:17.950 --> 24:19.144
(laughs)

24:19.190 --> 24:20.612
Thanks.

24:20.660 --> 24:21.979
Best election day gift ever.

24:22.020 --> 24:24.250
Hey, watch out. Behind you.

24:24.290 --> 24:26.520
Mr. Sheen,
it's Jonathan Elfman calling.

24:26.560 --> 24:28.050
Yes, sir.

24:28.100 --> 24:29.829
Well, no, I'm with the Florrick
campaign now, sir, and we were

24:29.860 --> 24:31.794
hoping maybe you'd record
a robocall for us today.

24:31.830 --> 24:33.127
JOSH:
Mr. Whitford, hi.

24:33.170 --> 24:35.593
I'm a campaign adviser
for Alicia Florrick.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.267
You've been a big supporter,
and we were hoping that...

24:37.300 --> 24:39.507
He's suggesting one of
the other cast members.

24:39.540 --> 24:40.905
VVho?
Uh, Melissa Fitzgerald.

24:40.940 --> 24:43.101
One of the secretaries.
Ooh, the one who died.

24:43.140 --> 24:44.698
What? No.
No, I mean
died on the show.

24:44.750 --> 24:46.547
I don't know.
Should I call?

24:46.580 --> 24:48.070
I mean, it's not as impressive
as the fictional president.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.076
The fictional dead secretary
to the fictional president?

24:50.120 --> 24:51.417
It's 2:30. We need
someone. Call.

24:51.450 --> 24:54.089
Okay. Mr. Sheen, you know,
we're gonna take you up
on that advice.

24:54.120 --> 24:55.781
The Supreme Court has upheld

24:55.820 --> 24:57.924
a woman's right to choose
since 1973.

24:57.960 --> 25:00.849
Ah, the great,
wise body.
And they've done
so repeatedly

25:00.900 --> 25:03.198
and with Scalia and
Alito on the Court.
You know,
once upon a time

25:03.230 --> 25:04.868
the court also
upheld Dred Scott.

25:04.900 --> 25:06.891
Oh, God!
Do you realize

25:06.930 --> 25:08.932
every other Western
democracy mocks us for
still having this debate.

25:08.970 --> 25:11.109
"Simili autem _modo
neque mulieri

25:11.140 --> 25:13.108
pessum abortivum
concedam..."

25:13.140 --> 25:15.700
So now we drag out the Latin.

25:15.740 --> 25:17.105
I mean, the original
Hippocratic oath

25:17.140 --> 25:19.540
orders doctors
to swear by Apollo.

25:19.580 --> 25:21.172
Are we to do that now?
Mm. A woman who
knows her Latin.

25:21.220 --> 25:23.176
I'm impressed.
Yes, a woman

25:23.220 --> 25:25.279
who should have
the right to choose.

25:25.320 --> 25:26.912
Notice the word.

25:26.950 --> 25:28.588
Have you ever seen
a five-month-old fetus?

25:28.620 --> 25:29.882
No.

25:29.920 --> 25:31.228
Have YOU EVGI' seen a woman

25:31.260 --> 25:32.989
dead from
a backstreet abortion?

25:33.030 --> 25:34.224
Yep.

25:34.260 --> 25:36.091
And I have seen a
five-month-old fetus.

25:36.130 --> 25:39.918
But I also know that
SCIence gives that fetus

25:39.970 --> 25:44.100
200/9 to 35% survival rate
at five months, all right?

25:44.140 --> 25:48.679
In other words, at the same
moment, any woman in America...

25:48.710 --> 25:51.201
And the world.
and the world, can
get an abortion,

25:51.250 --> 25:53.275
science gives that infant
a 30% chance of survival.

25:53.310 --> 25:54.914
So what?

25:54.950 --> 25:56.975
Abortion is murder?
At six months,

25:57.020 --> 25:59.147
survival rate
goes up to 50%.
So,

25:59.190 --> 26:01.988
you would put women in jail?
Come on, imprison them?
I'm not saying that.

26:02.020 --> 26:04.750
Yes, you are.
What is the option?
Admit the facts.

26:04.790 --> 26:06.758
Don't look away from
the aborted fetus.

26:06.790 --> 26:08.348
Look at it.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.356
Why is it not a baby?

26:10.400 --> 26:12.925
And-and why are
we kitchifying

26:12.970 --> 26:14.892
Good word.
these babies and...
Thank you.

26:14.940 --> 26:16.339
Kitchifying babies
and turning 'em

26:16.370 --> 26:18.008
_ into these cute
little Raphael cherubs,

26:18.040 --> 26:19.200
at the same time,
we're aborting

26:19.240 --> 26:21.299
1.2 million
of them a year?

26:21.340 --> 26:23.001
Because it's legal, and because

26:23.040 --> 26:24.746
you still haven't
answered the question.

26:24.780 --> 26:26.941
What are the options?
I don't need an option.

26:26.980 --> 26:28.914
It's not up to me
to have an option.

26:28.950 --> 26:30.076
Because you're a man.
Come on. That's
beneath you.

26:30.120 --> 26:31.678
No, it's not,
because I just said it,

26:31.720 --> 26:33.688
and you still
haven't answered.

26:33.720 --> 26:35.312
Look, bottom line,
I like people.

26:35.360 --> 26:36.952
I like you.

26:36.990 --> 26:38.855
I mean, you seem
smart, I think.

26:38.890 --> 26:43.259
I don't know why that next
fetus wouldn't turn into you,

26:43.300 --> 26:45.325
or me,

26:45.370 --> 26:49.329
and what would be lost to the
world if it were to be aborted.

26:49.370 --> 26:51.133
MAN (over walkie-talkie):
Would you guys shush?!
Here they come!

26:51.170 --> 26:53.365
Here they come.

26:56.910 --> 26:58.969
(school bell ringing)

26:59.010 --> 27:01.410
MAN (on radio):
Voters are motivated
by their self interests.

27:01.450 --> 27:04.044
They're going to cast their vote
for the candidate...

27:04.090 --> 27:05.409
TABITHA:
Are you looking for Dylan?

27:05.450 --> 27:07.918
He's inside... with
the headmaster.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.882
Why?

27:09.920 --> 27:12.127
(radio continues indistinctly)

27:13.960 --> 27:15.825
MAN (over P.A.):
Attention, students...
KALINDA: Hey, Dylan?

27:15.860 --> 27:17.396
What's going on?
You're late.

27:17.430 --> 27:19.091
Dad.

27:19.130 --> 27:20.893
MAN:
...but this is not up
for discussion.

27:20.940 --> 27:23.067
We've decided to counsel
Dylan out of the school.

27:23.100 --> 27:24.806
This is not a good fit.

27:24.840 --> 27:26.307
BISHOP:
His grades are stellar.
His fees are paid.

27:26.340 --> 27:28.228
I'm not seeing
a problem here.

27:28.280 --> 27:29.907
MAN:
I'm sure you do see
the problem, Mr. Bishop.

27:29.940 --> 27:31.248
We cannot endanger

27:31.280 --> 27:33.202
the other students with
your son's presence.

27:33.250 --> 27:37.243
Look, Dylan, why
don't we head home?

27:37.280 --> 27:39.441
Your dad will meet us there.
WOMAN:
i.

27:39.490 --> 27:41.082
"Do you remember me?

27:41.120 --> 27:42.781
"I'm Melissa Fitzgerald.

27:42.820 --> 27:45.323
I played Miss Landingham
on West Wing."

27:45.360 --> 27:48.989
It's "The" West Wing,
and Mrs. Landingham,

27:49.030 --> 27:51.863
and I didn't play Mrs.
Landingham on The West Wing.

27:51.900 --> 27:53.458
Yes. Sorry.
We knew that.

27:53.500 --> 27:55.934
Sorry. Uh, uh, uh,
it was an earlier draft,

27:55.970 --> 27:58.336
and we had to fire her,
an intern.

27:58.370 --> 28:00.133
(laughing):
But we want you.

28:00.170 --> 28:01.706
You sure?
Oh, yes. We're gonna

28:01.740 --> 28:03.037
send you a blah-blah,
a corrected draft.

28:03.080 --> 28:06.049
Right, Marissa?
Uh, yes, Mr. Mariner.

28:06.080 --> 28:08.878
I will.
Here I go, doing that.

28:08.920 --> 28:11.115
"I played Carol on

28:11.150 --> 28:12.788
"The West Wing.

28:12.820 --> 28:15.084
"I know that
if you're anything like me,

28:15.120 --> 28:17.008
you hate overpaying
for parking."

28:17.060 --> 28:18.220
I don't drive.

28:18.260 --> 28:20.854
You don't?
Nope, I take Ubers.

28:20.900 --> 28:22.754
(phone plays tune)
Do you want me to say,

28:22.800 --> 28:24.722
"I know if you're anything
like my friends, you..."

28:24.770 --> 28:26.123
Uh, Miss Landingham...

28:26.170 --> 28:27.364
(clears throat)
or Fitzgerald,

28:27.400 --> 28:29.265
as good as this is all going,

28:29.300 --> 28:31.063
I have to take this phone call.

28:31.110 --> 28:33.101
It's the, you know,
the exit polling, so...

28:33.140 --> 28:35.779
What about the
morning-after pill?

28:35.810 --> 28:37.277
It's proven,
it's effective.

28:37.310 --> 28:38.868
Shh.

28:38.910 --> 28:40.047
Right there. You see it?

28:40.080 --> 28:42.241
DIANE
Yes.

28:42.280 --> 28:44.748
We got the line of sight.
It's all yours. Take a shot.

28:44.790 --> 28:47.088
I-I can't.
Not like this.
Come on.

28:47.120 --> 28:49.111
It's a pest.
Deer are a hazard.

28:49.160 --> 28:51.219
They carry ticks.
They're overpopulated.

28:51.260 --> 28:53.319
If you don't take
the shot, I will.

28:55.330 --> 28:59.027
It's just grazing.
It's not doing anything.

28:59.070 --> 29:01.789
Would you do it
if it were charging you?

29:01.840 --> 29:03.865
(click, crow cawing)

29:03.910 --> 29:05.502
There you.
It's on the move.

29:05.540 --> 29:07.508
Take it down! Take it down!
If you don't, I will!

29:14.920 --> 29:17.115
(gunshot)

29:17.150 --> 29:20.517
(gasps)

29:27.560 --> 29:29.494
Alicia Florrick is going

29:32.070 --> 29:34.197
That was Governor Peter Florrick
earlier today saying things

29:34.240 --> 29:36.390
he may end up regretting
as we keep a close watch...

29:36.440 --> 29:38.032
Okay, tell me
what's gone wrong.

29:38.070 --> 29:39.901
We got the first
batch of exits.

29:39.940 --> 29:42.170
You know how we talked about
this being a turnout election?

29:42.210 --> 29:45.077
Yeah.
Prady's hitting his
numbers and then some.

29:45.110 --> 29:46.042
We're not.

29:46.080 --> 29:48.469
(sighs)
So what does that mean?

29:48.520 --> 29:50.841
It means
you should start working

29:50.890 --> 29:52.915
on your concession speech.

30:02.000 --> 30:06.596
POLMAR: Come on, it's not over.
ALICIA: Please. I've been around
politics long enough to know

30:06.630 --> 30:08.495
if you're chasing robocalls,

30:08.540 --> 30:11.338
hoping to get a last-minute push
at the polls,

30:14.380 --> 30:16.530
Not until the last vote is cast.
Finn, really,

30:16.580 --> 30:17.979
I'm okay with it.

30:18.010 --> 30:19.546
Alicia...
I'm serious.

30:19.580 --> 30:21.969
Most first-time candidates
don't succeed, right?

30:22.020 --> 30:25.217
You ran a great race.

30:25.250 --> 30:27.889
No.

30:27.920 --> 30:30.354
I didn't.

30:30.390 --> 30:31.857
The right man's winning.

30:33.260 --> 30:36.024
Well, did you write
a concession speech?

30:36.060 --> 30:37.869
I did that months ago.

30:37.900 --> 30:40.027
It was the first thing I did
after declaring.

30:40.070 --> 30:43.369
And the thing is,
losing is actually a relief.

30:43.400 --> 30:45.209
Well, then,

30:45.240 --> 30:46.935
congratulations.

30:46.970 --> 30:49.632
(gunfire on video game)

30:49.680 --> 30:52.240
I just told Elfman

30:52.280 --> 30:55.044
that I wouldn't do the robocall.

30:55.080 --> 30:56.911
I think you should reconsider.

30:56.950 --> 30:59.885
Alicia's defeat could be
a major embarrassment.

30:59.920 --> 31:01.979
I can already hear
the pundits laying blame,

31:02.020 --> 31:04.659
replaying the sound bite of you
saying she's the next S.A.

31:04.690 --> 31:06.885
Eli, I cannot do that robocall.

31:06.930 --> 31:08.329
It's stupid, it's obvious.

31:08.360 --> 31:10.294
Okay.

31:10.330 --> 31:12.662
Then what?

31:12.700 --> 31:15.237
(sighs)

31:16.200 --> 31:18.509
* From this valley

31:18.540 --> 31:23.978
* They say you are going

31:24.010 --> 31:25.671
Oh. (laughs)

31:25.710 --> 31:27.598
Is that, uh... mine?

31:27.650 --> 31:30.016
Congratulations.

31:30.050 --> 31:32.439
Good shot.

31:32.490 --> 31:39.987
* For they say
you are taking the sunshine *

31:40.030 --> 31:47.664
* Which has brightened
our pathways a while... *

31:48.700 --> 31:50.668
You all right?

31:50.700 --> 31:53.100
Oh, yes.

31:54.680 --> 31:57.035
It's just meat.
We eat it every day.

31:57.080 --> 31:59.947
Yes, and someone else kills it

31:59.980 --> 32:01.618
in some godforsaken
slaughterhouse

32:01.650 --> 32:03.948
while...

32:03.990 --> 32:07.414
I killed it... in nature.

32:07.450 --> 32:09.589
But, uh...

32:09.620 --> 32:12.157
(sighs)

32:13.490 --> 32:15.629
You don't need
to do it again.

32:15.660 --> 32:17.969
You don't need to hunt.

32:18.000 --> 32:20.161
You don't understand.

32:21.440 --> 32:24.000
I liked it.

32:30.010 --> 32:32.399
(phone ringing)

32:32.450 --> 32:36.170
Sorry.

32:36.220 --> 32:38.313
We've got good news
and better news.

32:38.350 --> 32:40.989
First off, Gil Berridge
is definitely in play.

32:41.020 --> 32:43.488
He axed Sewell & Augustine
because he felt like

32:43.520 --> 32:45.488
they were taking on too
many cases with conflicts.

32:45.530 --> 32:48.158
Yeah, thanks, but I think

32:48.200 --> 32:49.758
Gil Berridge may be
a non-starter.

32:49.800 --> 32:53.019
What did you do, Diane?
Or what didn't you do?

32:53.070 --> 32:54.731
Too long and complicated.
What's the other news?

32:54.770 --> 32:56.499
CARY:
Well,

32:56.540 --> 32:58.235
it turns out
the fourth richest man

32:58.270 --> 32:59.669
in America is _
at your little shindig.

32:59.710 --> 33:01.598
VVho?

33:01.640 --> 33:03.335
Reese Dipple.
He's right behind Bill Gates,

33:03.380 --> 33:04.779
Warren Buffett
and Larry Ellison.

33:04.810 --> 33:06.209
Reese Dipple?

33:06.250 --> 33:08.047
CARY:
Yeah, you don't hear about him

33:08.080 --> 33:10.048
because his conglomerates
are all unsexy businesses,

33:10.080 --> 33:12.583
like industrial gases,
pulp and paper.

33:12.620 --> 33:14.656
He mostly gives
to anti-choice causes.

33:18.730 --> 33:20.083
R.D.?

33:20.130 --> 33:21.427
Yeah, did you
meet him?

33:21.460 --> 33:23.052
Uh, what does he look like?

33:23.100 --> 33:24.067
He doesn't like
being photographed,

33:24.100 --> 33:25.294
so we_don't have
anything recent.

33:25.330 --> 33:26.763
All right, I'll call you back.

33:29.300 --> 33:31.404
REPORTER: Welcome back to
coverage of the Cook County...

33:31.440 --> 33:33.408
BISHOP:
I need to talk to you
about something.

33:33.440 --> 33:35.101
Sure.

33:35.140 --> 33:37.574
(TV continues indistinctly)

33:39.250 --> 33:41.616
You _want
something else?

33:41.650 --> 33:43.641
No, it's fine.

33:45.650 --> 33:49.256
This is the third school
Dylan has had to leave.

33:49.290 --> 33:53.078
Look, I'm sure you'll
find a good school.

33:53.130 --> 33:56.122
Mm. And that school
will ask him to leave.

33:58.130 --> 34:02.191
My life is strangling any chance
of him living his.

34:05.840 --> 34:07.603
You're being
followed, Kalinda.

34:09.610 --> 34:10.804
What?

34:10.840 --> 34:12.808
The men we stopped
in the SUV,

34:12.850 --> 34:14.818
the ones following you
to school,

34:14.850 --> 34:16.841
they weren't
following Dylan.

34:16.880 --> 34:18.745
They were following you.

34:20.420 --> 34:21.819
Why?

34:21.860 --> 34:24.249
They work for the
state's attorney's office.

34:25.690 --> 34:27.555
ASA Geneva Pine.

34:33.630 --> 34:35.598
We're seeing lower than
expected turnout in suburbs

34:35.640 --> 34:38.234
like Barrington,
Northbrook, Orland Park--

34:38.270 --> 34:41.137
all of which were expected
to favor Mrs. Florrick.

34:41.180 --> 34:44.149
For now, though, with only 46%
of precincts reporting,
(kitchen appliance whirs)

34:44.180 --> 34:45.772
the race is still neck-and-neck.

34:45.810 --> 34:47.778
Until the loop and
inner-city precincts report.

34:47.810 --> 34:49.414
that's where
Prady's voters are,

34:49.450 --> 34:51.281
and then we're
gonna get buried.

34:51.320 --> 34:53.345
Marissa,
could you please?
What?

34:53.390 --> 34:55.187
Will you stop it
with the cappuccino?

34:55.220 --> 34:56.551
Hey, at least
I have a skill

34:56.590 --> 34:57.887
to fall back on if
this falls through.

34:57.920 --> 34:59.581
POLMAR:
You want my advice?

34:59.630 --> 35:01.495
Plan something fun
for tomorrow just in case.

35:01.530 --> 35:03.122
You know, go for dinner
with somebody.

35:03.160 --> 35:04.127
That's what I do
when I'm waiting

35:04.170 --> 35:05.262
for a verdict to come in.

35:05.300 --> 35:06.665
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

35:06.700 --> 35:08.292
If I drink any more coffee,

35:08.340 --> 35:09.637
I'm gonna be up
straight through tomorrow.

35:09.670 --> 35:10.864
Wait, behind you!

35:10.900 --> 35:11.867
POLMAR:
Aah!

35:11.910 --> 35:13.866
Good shot, thanks.

35:13.910 --> 35:15.275
Don't mention it, partner.

35:15.310 --> 35:16.277
You know what, you're right.

35:16.310 --> 35:18.278
I do need to plan something.

35:18.310 --> 35:20.198
Have dinner with me
tomorrow night.

35:20.250 --> 35:21.649
Uh...

35:21.680 --> 35:25.389
Uh, I'd love to,
but I can't-- I have plans.

35:25.420 --> 35:26.842
Oh.

35:28.420 --> 35:30.650
Look, I feel like a jerk
because I suggested it,

35:30.690 --> 35:32.282
but, um...

35:32.330 --> 35:34.298
um...

35:34.330 --> 35:36.525
I'm actually seeing somebody.

35:36.560 --> 35:38.528
Oh.

35:38.570 --> 35:40.162
It only just started, but, uh...

35:40.200 --> 35:41.292
No, that-that's great.

35:41.340 --> 35:43.160
But, you know,
H can reschedule.

35:43.200 --> 35:44.906
Oh, n-n-no, don't be silly.

35:44.940 --> 35:45.929
Alicia, you got to get in here.

35:45.970 --> 35:47.164
Okay, I'm coming!

35:47.210 --> 35:48.177
Hey, Finn.

35:48.210 --> 35:49.370
I have to go.

35:49.410 --> 35:50.809
I will...
(explosion)

35:50.840 --> 35:52.239
talk to you soon, okay?

35:52.280 --> 35:53.247
Uh, yeah.

35:53.280 --> 35:55.714
Sure.

35:57.350 --> 35:59.784
(sighing)

35:59.820 --> 36:01.185
(sighs)

36:03.320 --> 36:04.753
MAN (on TV):
Northbound Lower Wacker
is your best bet.

36:04.790 --> 36:06.621
Back to you Rob.
What's going on?

36:06.660 --> 36:09.254
ROB (on TV): As you can see
from this footage, traffic is at

36:09.300 --> 36:11.894
a standstill in the loop because
of the governor's speech.

36:11.930 --> 36:13.761
If possible,
you're going to want

36:13.800 --> 36:15.734
to avoid that area at all costs.

36:15.770 --> 36:17.931
He's giving a last-minute, you
know, speech from Daley Plaza,

36:17.970 --> 36:19.403
and that's gonna
kill Prady's turnout.

36:19.440 --> 36:20.805
JOHNNY:
Nobody wants to fight

36:20.840 --> 36:22.432
traffic to get
to the polls.

36:22.480 --> 36:24.209
It's gonna smother all
the after-work voters.

36:24.250 --> 36:25.808
REPORTER: ...speech about
crime rates and pensions,

36:25.850 --> 36:27.306
the governor urged
all citizens...

36:27.350 --> 36:28.942
You think he knew
what he was doing?

36:28.980 --> 36:31.642
No. Not after he fought
us the way that he did.

36:32.890 --> 36:34.585
He knew.

36:34.620 --> 36:36.417
The polling stations
do not close till 7:00 p.m.

36:36.460 --> 36:38.928
(owl hooting)
* Oh, give me a home

36:41.260 --> 36:42.693
* Where the buffalo roam

36:42.730 --> 36:44.288
What's the matter, don't
you like our venison?

36:44.330 --> 36:46.924
Uh, no, I'm, uh...
I'm just not hungry...

36:46.970 --> 36:49.188
Reese?

36:51.470 --> 36:54.007
I never really
liked that name.

36:54.040 --> 36:57.635
* A discouraging word

36:57.680 --> 37:00.240
* And the skies are not
cloudy all day *

37:00.280 --> 37:01.417
Aren't you going to pitch me?

37:01.450 --> 37:03.338
Is there any reason to?

37:03.380 --> 37:05.382
I am looking for a new law firm.
Mr. Dipple,

37:05.420 --> 37:08.548
we spent two hours
arguing over abortion.

37:08.590 --> 37:10.615
Very enjoyable hours.

37:10.660 --> 37:13.458
I like working with people
I don't necessarily agree with.

37:16.960 --> 37:19.520
We won't argue
any anti-choice cases.

37:19.570 --> 37:21.697
Pro-life cases?

37:21.740 --> 37:25.267
Pro-life cases, either.
We won't.

37:25.310 --> 37:27.870
* And the skies
are not cloudy... *

37:27.910 --> 37:31.778
Give me a call on Friday,
we'll talk.

37:32.980 --> 37:39.579
Home, home on the range *

37:39.620 --> 37:46.287
* Where the deer
and the antelope play *

37:46.330 --> 37:49.925
* Where seldom is heard...

37:49.960 --> 37:51.325
REPORTER:
Welcome back to coverage

37:51.370 --> 37:52.723
of the Cook County
State's Attorney race.

37:52.770 --> 37:54.397
All eyes are
on the candidates...

37:54.440 --> 37:56.738
Will they call it
right at 7:00 p.m.?

37:56.770 --> 37:59.034
If the numbers are, you know,
trending strong enough.

37:59.070 --> 38:01.800
Here we go.

38:01.840 --> 38:04.035
...as the polls are officially
closing now in Cook County.

38:04.080 --> 38:08.710
And apparently, CBS is prepared
to predict a winner

38:08.750 --> 38:11.014
in the hotly-contested
state's attorney race.

38:11.050 --> 38:14.383
And we'll have those results
for you right after the break.
(all sigh)

38:20.830 --> 38:24.493
JOHNSON: It's a busy night
in Cook County as returns

38:24.530 --> 38:27.624
continue to stream in, and,
as promised, we can make a call

38:27.670 --> 38:29.490
in the Cook County
State's Attorney race.

38:29.540 --> 38:31.758
_ In a race
With enough star power to fuel

38:31.810 --> 38:33.698
a dozen
state's attorney battles,

38:33.740 --> 38:35.935
legal commentator Frank Prady

38:35.980 --> 38:38.778
faced attorney and wife of
the governor, Alicia Florrick.

38:38.810 --> 38:41.745
(TV news music plays)
And Alicia Florrick

38:41.780 --> 38:43.645
has held off
Frank Prady's aggressive...

38:43.680 --> 38:45.580
Here's a live look at the
(screaming happily)

38:45.620 --> 38:48.487
Florrick headquarters where
they've just gotten the news.
(cheering)

38:48.520 --> 38:50.579
Looks like they're
celebrating already.

38:50.620 --> 38:53.350
(laughter, phone ringing)

38:53.390 --> 38:55.551
Hey!

38:56.830 --> 38:59.367
Hello.

38:59.400 --> 39:01.436
_ _ ELI: _
AllCla, congratulations!

39:01.470 --> 39:03.688
Oh, Eli. Uh, thank you.

39:03.740 --> 39:04.866
There's nothing
like your first win.

39:04.910 --> 39:06.138
Uh, yeah, I suppose so. Uh...

39:06.170 --> 39:07.808
A bit surreal.

39:07.840 --> 39:09.398
Believe me, they'll be bursting
your bubble soon enough,

39:09.440 --> 39:10.805
so, tonight, savor it.

39:10.840 --> 39:12.603
I'll try.

39:12.650 --> 39:15.710
Um... Eli, is Peter coming
to the victory party?

39:15.750 --> 39:18.071
Of course.
We'll see you there.

39:18.120 --> 39:20.987
JOHNSON: Thanks, Maria.
So what now for Frank Prady?

39:21.020 --> 39:23.011
This has been suggested
to be one of the most

39:23.060 --> 39:24.687
heavily financed
state's attorney races

39:24.730 --> 39:26.789
in the county's history.

39:26.830 --> 39:28.058
Will Frank Prady throw his hat

39:28.090 --> 39:30.524
into the political arena again
after this?

39:30.560 --> 39:32.562
His campaign has just released
a statement

39:32.600 --> 39:34.568
saying that he will be making
his concession speech

39:34.600 --> 39:36.739
within the next hour.

39:36.770 --> 39:38.806
(line ringing)
We have cameras standing by
at Prady headquarters...

39:44.850 --> 39:46.101
(car door opening)

39:47.910 --> 39:50.743
Thank you
for meeting me like this.

39:50.780 --> 39:52.418
No problem.

39:52.450 --> 39:54.589
Gives me a chance
to concede in person.

39:54.620 --> 39:56.053
Oh. Sorry.

39:56.090 --> 39:57.785
No, no, no.
Congratulations.

39:57.820 --> 39:59.629
Good job.

39:59.660 --> 40:01.594
So, what couldn't wait?

40:01.630 --> 40:03.757
Come work with me.

40:03.800 --> 40:05.893
Work with you?
What do you mean?

40:05.930 --> 40:07.568
At the state's
attorney's office.

40:07.600 --> 40:08.760
Be the deputy.

40:08.800 --> 40:11.462
Be your second?

40:11.510 --> 40:14.479
Yes. Be my corrective.

40:14.510 --> 40:16.569
(laughs)

40:16.610 --> 40:18.498
A team of rivals?

40:18.550 --> 40:20.768
(laughing):
Yes.

40:21.950 --> 40:23.838
No.

40:23.880 --> 40:26.212
Why not?
We'd be great together.

40:26.250 --> 40:29.515
One good thing came
out of our campaign.

40:29.560 --> 40:31.687
Our positions were clarified,

40:31.730 --> 40:35.928
and I essentially don't believe
in your approach, Alicia.

40:35.960 --> 40:40.897
I-I_think it's based_in_
pe55imism and not optimism.

40:40.930 --> 40:43.069
And I don't think
it will work.

40:43.100 --> 40:46.069
But besides that...?

40:46.110 --> 40:48.704
(laughs)

40:49.910 --> 40:51.741
I better go.

40:51.780 --> 40:53.805
I have a concession
speech to give.

40:53.850 --> 40:55.613
You're sure?

40:55.650 --> 40:57.868
Yes.

40:57.920 --> 40:59.547
KALIN DA:
She won.

40:59.590 --> 41:02.684
I never had
any doubt she would.

41:02.720 --> 41:04.859
Now I need you more than ever.

41:10.800 --> 41:13.166
I'm getting out.

41:13.200 --> 41:15.191
Excuse me?

41:15.240 --> 41:16.867
This is the end for me.

41:16.900 --> 41:19.232
I'm giving up the trade,

41:19.270 --> 41:22.899
going straight.

41:22.940 --> 41:27.639
I need you to go to Alicia and
tell her I am ready to retire.

41:27.680 --> 41:31.070
But she needs to get Geneva Pine
to drop this investigation.

41:31.120 --> 41:34.886
Retired dealers
always end up in prison.

41:36.690 --> 41:39.750
They lose their power,
they lose their clout.

41:39.790 --> 41:41.997
Everybody comes
gunning for them.

41:44.770 --> 41:47.796
I need to know
that I'll stay free.

41:51.300 --> 41:54.508
(applause and cheering)

41:58.310 --> 42:00.141
So, are you staying or going?

42:00.180 --> 42:02.011
I don't know.

42:02.050 --> 42:05.542
There's a job in LA,
but I've grown to like Chicago.

42:05.590 --> 42:06.818
You?

42:06.850 --> 42:08.818
Alicia could
use the help.
Yeah.

42:08.860 --> 42:10.589
Maybe.

42:12.990 --> 42:14.719
(cheering)

42:14.760 --> 42:16.990
(cheering grows louder)

42:22.240 --> 42:26.734
(cheering continues)

42:35.880 --> 42:38.246
(reporters chattering)

42:40.920 --> 42:44.788
But then, I've never been
a guy to stay in one place.

42:44.830 --> 42:46.923
So you're going?

42:46.960 --> 42:50.293
Take care of her.

42:55.940 --> 42:58.329
