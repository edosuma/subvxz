00:06.257 --> 00:08.122
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

01:22.500 --> 01:25.583
DRAMA: Am I nuts or would a hoodie
make me look 10 years younger?

01:25.670 --> 01:26.785
1 O years younger than him
maybe, Drama.

01:26.879 --> 01:27.960
Blow me, E.

01:28.047 --> 01:29.412
I don't know what
you're so nervous about, Johnny.

01:29.507 --> 01:30.497
You're just going back to work.

01:30.967 --> 01:32.298
Guys at work think I'm old, bro.

01:32.385 --> 01:34.797
They treat me old,
and the writers write me old.

01:35.012 --> 01:36.423
This season I'm aging down.

01:36.514 --> 01:39.176
I'm gonna get rne a storyline
with someone around 19.

01:39.267 --> 01:41.929
- He'll play your boy toy.
- Would you look at this beast?

01:42.019 --> 01:44.431
Looks just like the one I got at
the Army/Navy in the sixth grade.

01:44.522 --> 01:46.308
Yeah, only about two grand more.

01:46.399 --> 01:48.436
Two grand just to hang
with the cool kids, huh?

01:48.526 --> 01:51.234
Great, Johnny,
you know what? It's on me.

01:52.029 --> 01:53.406
You come into some money, bro?

01:53.489 --> 01:55.947
- No, we got into Cannes.
- It's a film festival, not a job, Vince.

01:56.033 --> 01:58.240
Jobs are coming, E. I can feel it.

01:58.327 --> 02:00.944
Here's my Barney's card.
Knock yourself out.

02:01.038 --> 02:03.120
- I'll take it off my tab, bro.
- Sweet.

02:03.207 --> 02:05.198
We got Walsh upstairs in five.
We'll see you guys later.

02:05.293 --> 02:06.704
- Later.
- Have fun, boys.

02:07.044 --> 02:08.580
All right, you buying that
or what, pretty woman?

02:09.463 --> 02:11.670
Not now, Turtle. Check out that hat.

02:12.717 --> 02:14.128
<i>- TURTLE". What about it?
- It's awesome.</i>

02:14.218 --> 02:16.505
The potheads at work will freak.

02:16.595 --> 02:19.428
Potheads? You're aging yourself
up with that phrase, Drama.

02:19.515 --> 02:21.677
Yo, pretty dope lid
you're sporting there, hombre.

02:21.767 --> 02:23.508
Where'd you get it?

02:23.644 --> 02:26.102
So maybe we should
start thinking about a new house.

02:26.188 --> 02:28.099
Yeah, maybe we should start
thinking about a new job.

02:28.190 --> 02:30.181
I told you, E, jobs are coming.

02:30.693 --> 02:32.604
- God, you're so negative.
- Hey!

02:32.695 --> 02:35.608
- Hey, Snoop, what up?
- Nothing like you got going on.

02:35.698 --> 02:37.314
- What's up, Snoop?
- What's up, E?

02:37.408 --> 02:40.070
See you all got that "Medellin"
into Cannes or is it Cannes?

02:40.161 --> 02:41.401
- It's Cannes.
- It's Cannes.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.077
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:43.205 --> 02:45.458
- Either way, man, congratulations.
- VINCE: Thanks.

02:45.541 --> 02:48.158
And I seen the trailer. Whoo!
That motherfucker's off the hook.

02:48.252 --> 02:49.834
- Trailer?
- Where?

02:49.920 --> 02:51.001
On YouTube this morning.

02:51.088 --> 02:53.079
Y'all make "Blow"
look like "Romper Room."

02:53.174 --> 02:54.790
- (SIGHS)
- Thanks.

02:54.884 --> 02:56.420
Success and nothing less, man.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.625
All right, Snoop,
we'll see you next time.

02:57.720 --> 02:58.926
Peace.

02:59.013 --> 03:00.344
Somebody leaked the trailer?

03:00.431 --> 03:03.765
- Walsh should be happy.
- I think he already isn't.

03:04.060 --> 03:05.926
Hey, what's up, Billy?

03:06.228 --> 03:08.640
Nothing good. Somebody
put the trailer on the net.

03:08.731 --> 03:11.314
- Yeah, I know. We just heard.
- Yeah, any idea who?

03:11.400 --> 03:12.640
Just one.

03:13.986 --> 03:15.522
What, are you kidding me?

03:15.613 --> 03:17.854
- I only gave it to you.
- Yeah, and it's at my house.

03:17.948 --> 03:20.235
Yeah, and now
it's all over the fucking internet,

03:20.326 --> 03:23.364
- you rat cocksucker.
- Listen, E would never do that.

03:23.454 --> 03:25.286
Vince, he hated the movie.
He was wrong.

03:25.373 --> 03:27.535
Now he's trying to sabotage it
no matter what it does to you.

03:27.625 --> 03:29.662
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you.

03:29.794 --> 03:31.580
You suck at your job.
You got a Napoleonic complex,

03:31.670 --> 03:33.581
and I'm gonna fuck your mother
if I ever meet her.

03:33.672 --> 03:35.333
- Get your finger out of my face.
- Or what?

03:35.424 --> 03:36.755
- It's gonna end up up your ass.
- Why don't you admit

03:36.842 --> 03:39.755
that you're a traitorous pussy
and you like to suck cock?

03:39.845 --> 03:41.256
Hey hey hey!

03:41.847 --> 03:43.303
(CLAMORING)

03:46.352 --> 03:48.969
Are you sure the kid
said 7263 Melrose?

03:49.772 --> 03:51.638
Yeah, right next to Albano's.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.315
This don't look like a clothing store.

03:56.612 --> 03:57.977
Look again.

03:59.323 --> 04:01.155
(SNIFFING) You smell that?

04:01.534 --> 04:03.775
Yeah, Albano's.
We'll get a slice of pepperoni after.

04:03.869 --> 04:05.610
I'm not talking about pizza.

04:06.163 --> 04:08.029
That's some fine herb.

04:08.124 --> 04:10.115
Yeah, what is this place?

04:12.795 --> 04:14.251
Heaven maybe.

04:16.423 --> 04:19.166
- Can I help you fellas?
- Yes, I believe you can.

04:19.552 --> 04:23.295
I would like to purchase one black
California homegrown trucker hat,

04:23.389 --> 04:25.380
similar to the one
on that fella over there.

04:25.474 --> 04:27.260
Sure, chief, soon as I see your card.

04:27.852 --> 04:29.468
Card, what card?

04:29.562 --> 04:31.428
The card that says you're allowed in.

04:34.024 --> 04:35.981
Why wouldn't I be allowed in?

04:36.068 --> 04:39.106
I hope there are no discriminatory
practices going on here, because--

04:39.196 --> 04:41.062
Is this a medical marijuana facility?

04:41.157 --> 04:43.615
Uh-huh, and no card, no service.

04:44.326 --> 04:46.363
Wow. Yo, something
about getting my weed legally

04:46.454 --> 04:48.912
just never seemed right,
but this looks okay.

04:48.998 --> 04:50.033
It is okay.

04:50.124 --> 04:52.035
Look, I don't want any weed.
I just want the hat.

04:52.126 --> 04:55.664
Well, you can't get that hat,
not without a card. Sorry.

04:56.005 --> 04:57.916
Come on, Drama, it's just a hat.

04:58.007 --> 04:59.122
It's not just a hat, Turtle.

04:59.216 --> 05:01.594
It's the key to me landing
the cover of "Tiger Beat."

05:01.677 --> 05:03.463
Where do I get one of these cards?

05:03.554 --> 05:05.716
You need a doctor's prescription.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.717
Yeah, that's great, just great.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.674
- Let's go, Drama.
- Where to?

05:09.768 --> 05:11.975
Get you checked out.
I know a guy, come on.

05:12.062 --> 05:13.723
(INHALES DEEPLY)

05:14.106 --> 05:16.564
Hey, E, you're not gonna take
Ari down too, are you?

05:16.650 --> 05:18.937
That's funny, Vince, but this kid's
had it coming for a long time.

05:19.028 --> 05:20.610
But in the middle of Barney's?

05:20.696 --> 05:22.653
You're right. I should have
done it a month ago on set

05:22.740 --> 05:23.855
and saved myself the ulcer.

05:23.949 --> 05:25.110
You're lucky
you didn't get arrested.

05:25.201 --> 05:26.817
He's lucky that busboy
was there to pull me off.

05:26.911 --> 05:28.618
I would have fuckin' killed him.
Hey, Lloyd.

05:28.704 --> 05:30.536
Ooh, somebody's
got a sexy tear in their shirt.

05:30.623 --> 05:32.489
Oh, man, I just bought this.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.915
No need to get upset.
If you take it off I could sew it,

05:35.002 --> 05:36.834
good as new in a mere moment.

05:36.921 --> 05:39.379
Save your homoerotic
slave labor for me, Lloyd.

05:39.465 --> 05:41.672
E, don't take your shirt off.
I don't want anyone going blind

05:41.759 --> 05:44.501
from the reflection
off your translucent boy chest.

05:44.595 --> 05:46.632
Don't start with E, Ari.
He's very aggressive today.

05:46.722 --> 05:48.178
Ooh, that's scary.

05:48.265 --> 05:50.222
So my services are not required?

05:50.309 --> 05:52.346
- Thanks anyway.
- Let's do this.

05:52.436 --> 05:53.892
Did you hear about the trailer?

05:54.021 --> 05:55.352
That's all I've been hearing about.

05:55.439 --> 05:57.555
Lloyd, how many calls have we
gotten already about Vince?

05:57.650 --> 05:59.140
<i>LLOYD". A baker's dozen, at least.</i>

05:59.235 --> 06:01.192
Including Jeff Katzenberg,
who called and said

06:01.278 --> 06:03.189
it was like when
he saw the "Ray" trailer

06:03.280 --> 06:05.191
and knew that Jamie Foxx
was gonna get an Oscar nom.

06:05.282 --> 06:07.944
- So this is good news?
- No, this is not good news.

06:08.035 --> 06:11.244
Good news is when the wife agrees
to eat box for your birthday.

06:11.330 --> 06:13.071
This is great news!

06:13.332 --> 06:14.697
I told you
things were gonna start turning.

06:14.792 --> 06:15.953
<i>They are turning fast.</i>

06:16.043 --> 06:17.249
Every studio in town
wants to take a meeting.

06:17.336 --> 06:18.371
Awesome

06:18.462 --> 06:20.703
but I only wanna take one meeting
with one studio,

06:20.798 --> 06:22.163
if you guys are still on board.

06:22.258 --> 06:23.373
Still on board with what?

06:23.467 --> 06:25.959
Well, even though
I pretty much find E useless,

06:26.053 --> 06:27.339
he did slip me this one year ago.

06:27.429 --> 06:28.555
Wow, you remembered this, Ari.

06:28.639 --> 06:29.925
Don't get all misty on me, E.

06:30.140 --> 06:33.269
"Lost in the Clouds,"
about the hiker up Mount Annapurna.

06:33.352 --> 06:35.969
- I love that story.
- It is on a fast track. Good eye, E.

06:36.313 --> 06:39.146
Guess who's in control of this one.
Dana Gordon.

06:39.441 --> 06:42.058
Dana Gordon?
She hates you, doesn't she?

06:42.152 --> 06:44.314
- Only until she loves me again.
- You got her fired, Ari.

06:44.405 --> 06:46.567
Yes, I did,
but now she's got a new bigger job.

06:46.657 --> 06:47.863
It would have taken her years

06:47.950 --> 06:49.190
without a good
goddamn kick in the ass.

06:49.285 --> 06:52.198
Plus, I got pictures,
slides actually, of her

06:53.289 --> 06:55.951
begging me. You know what
I'm saying? So here's the deal.

06:56.041 --> 06:57.543
Now I am ready

06:58.043 --> 07:00.910
to clear my calendar
and focus on one mission

07:01.005 --> 07:03.497
if you choose to accept.
Do you choose?

07:03.591 --> 07:06.003
- Absolutely.
- Get us a payday, Ari.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.380
Choose some clothes other than
the ones from the Salvation Army, E.

07:08.470 --> 07:11.007
- This is Ralph Lauren, Ari.
- One more <i>thing:</i>

07:11.098 --> 07:12.088
my boy Elvis Mitchell,

07:12.182 --> 07:13.843
former superstar critic
of the "New York Times,"

07:13.934 --> 07:15.891
is in town doing a piece
for "Interview" magazine

07:15.978 --> 07:18.640
about the brains behind "Medellin"--
and you too, E.

07:19.023 --> 07:20.639
- Really?
- Nice.

07:20.733 --> 07:22.019
Gotta keep that momentum pushing.

07:22.276 --> 07:24.017
Can you do early drinks
at the Beverly Wilshire?

07:24.111 --> 07:26.068
- Sure.
- <i>And call Walsh.</i>

07:27.197 --> 07:28.528
No problem.

07:29.366 --> 07:30.777
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.531
- I gotta use my real name?
- You want the card?

07:35.748 --> 07:37.113
I wanna improve my image, Turtle,

07:37.207 --> 07:38.584
not end up as an "Us Weekly" headline.

07:39.001 --> 07:41.709
You should be so lucky,
and this is not headline material.

07:42.338 --> 07:43.624
This is perfectly legal.

07:43.714 --> 07:44.875
All you have to do is convince them

07:44.965 --> 07:46.126
that there's
something wrong with you.

07:46.383 --> 07:48.545
But there's not.
I'm the picture of health.

07:49.887 --> 07:52.219
Hey, kid, what are you claiming?

07:53.265 --> 07:56.053
Nerve damage
from a skateboarding accident.

07:56.185 --> 07:57.721
Huh... and you?

07:58.729 --> 08:00.891
Same, but from a car accident.

08:02.441 --> 08:04.352
How about you
on a motorcycle accident?

08:05.194 --> 08:06.980
- And I have nerve damage?
- Sure, why not?

08:08.197 --> 08:10.985
Because I'm too physically fit
to have nerve damage, Turtle.

08:11.075 --> 08:13.316
- Look at these pipes.
- Oh, God.

08:13.410 --> 08:14.992
- Johnny Chase.
- Right here.

08:15.079 --> 08:16.410
Follow me.

08:17.081 --> 08:18.697
What are you gonna go with?

08:18.791 --> 08:20.407
My improv skills.

08:21.293 --> 08:22.829
You have Legionnaire's disease?

08:22.920 --> 08:24.081
That's right.

08:24.213 --> 08:26.204
Legionnaire's disease
is a chronic lung disorder.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.714
I know. It's terrible.

08:28.801 --> 08:31.589
Mr. Chase, I don't think
smoking marijuana

08:32.221 --> 08:35.714
is the right treatment
for a chronic lung disease, do you?

08:37.142 --> 08:38.724
Well, you're the doc.

08:39.436 --> 08:42.929
Typically, medical marijuana
is used to treat nausea

08:43.357 --> 08:46.065
- as related to cancer.
- I don't have cancer.

08:46.276 --> 08:48.529
- Crohn's disease?
- What's that?

08:48.612 --> 08:52.071
Intestinal problems,
extreme bouts of diarrhea?

08:52.282 --> 08:53.738
Thank you, no.

08:53.951 --> 08:56.283
- AIDS?
- Tested biweekly. No no.

08:56.912 --> 08:58.653
I think we're at a stalemate here.

09:00.457 --> 09:02.915
Hey, Doc, can I be honest with you?

09:03.085 --> 09:04.246
I don't want any pot.

09:04.336 --> 09:06.452
I just want the hat
that they sell at the place.

09:06.672 --> 09:08.003
That's all. Just a hat.

09:08.257 --> 09:09.747
Well, could I be honest with you?

09:09.842 --> 09:13.005
I can't give you a card unless
you give me a legitimate reason to.

09:13.387 --> 09:16.300
So will you give me one?

09:16.932 --> 09:19.299
- Can I go back to Crohn's disease?
- You already said no.

09:19.393 --> 09:21.634
- What else is there?
- Well, you can't think of anything?

09:22.312 --> 09:25.100
No, I'm usually so good on my feet.
Fuck, I need that hat.

09:25.190 --> 09:27.522
Why? What is so important
about this hat?

09:28.819 --> 09:31.106
Doc, in my line of work,
you gotta do everything you can

09:31.196 --> 09:34.860
to look young. And since I dare
not stick a Botox needle

09:34.950 --> 09:38.284
in my face for fear
of losing my comic expressiveness,

09:38.746 --> 09:40.612
<i>this hat is all I got.</i>

09:40.789 --> 09:44.373
You seem like an anxious person.
Is this a fair assessment?

09:44.460 --> 09:45.541
Well...

09:45.627 --> 09:47.914
Do you feel nervous
for no apparent reason?

09:48.380 --> 09:50.166
- Sometimes.
- Hyperventilating?

09:51.216 --> 09:52.627
I do have a history of panic attacks.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.587
- Beautiful.
- I think it's hereditary.

09:54.678 --> 09:56.089
Well, go get yourself a hat.

09:56.638 --> 09:58.720
And do yourself a favor:
while you're there,

09:58.807 --> 10:02.095
pick up some nice chill weed
and smoke just a little.

10:02.686 --> 10:06.395
I think you're gonna find your life
just a tad more manageable.

10:06.690 --> 10:07.930
<i>Trust me.</i>

10:10.194 --> 10:12.606
- Thank <i>you, Doc.</i>
<i>- You're welcome.</i>

10:13.530 --> 10:16.238
There is no fucking way
I'm apologizing to thatjerkoff, Vince.

10:16.700 --> 10:18.441
- Forget it.
- I'm not asking you to apologize,

10:18.535 --> 10:20.071
- but you have to talk to him.
- Why?

10:20.162 --> 10:22.950
Why? Because he's our director
and we have a movie to finish.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.872
I can finish the movie
without saying dick to him.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.869
He doesn't listen to me anyway.

10:26.960 --> 10:27.995
And what about tonight?

10:28.086 --> 10:29.952
You go. Elvis Mitchell
doesn't care about me.

10:30.047 --> 10:32.755
E, the guy's trying to write a story
about three guys from New York

10:32.841 --> 10:35.503
who made a movie, not two.
You understand?

10:35.928 --> 10:37.293
All right, fine, I'll go.
But you better tell Walsh

10:37.387 --> 10:39.219
not to fucking antagonize rne
or it's gonna get ugly.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.467
- All right.
- I'm serious.

10:40.557 --> 10:41.638
Okay.

10:43.227 --> 10:45.844
- She in?
- No, you cannot go in there, Mr. Gold.

10:46.396 --> 10:49.263
How is the most fuckable president
of production in town?

10:49.358 --> 10:50.598
Ari, get the fuck out.

10:50.692 --> 10:54.151
I brought Cristal and Sprinkles
cupcakes. Your favorite.

10:54.238 --> 10:56.149
Or is it mine? What's the difference?

10:56.240 --> 10:58.072
We used to eat everything
off each other anyway.

10:58.867 --> 11:00.733
I have to call you back.

11:01.328 --> 11:02.568
What do you want, Ari?

11:02.704 --> 11:03.990
Have you seen Vince's trailer?

11:04.081 --> 11:06.163
- I have. It's good.
- Oh, please.

11:06.500 --> 11:07.490
It's fucking great.

11:07.584 --> 11:09.837
Gonna be downloaded more times
than Britney's beaver shot.

11:09.920 --> 11:12.287
- Point?
- Point is I just left him.

11:12.422 --> 11:13.799
He loves "Lost in the Clouds" enough

11:13.882 --> 11:16.715
to let you scoop him up
before every studio in town begs

11:16.802 --> 11:19.464
for his services. I'm telling you, Dana,

11:19.888 --> 11:22.346
buy him today for half of
what you pay for him tomorrow.

11:22.432 --> 11:23.684
I can't.

11:24.101 --> 11:26.968
Dana, do not hold
our personal problems against Vince.

11:27.062 --> 11:30.054
Ari, Vince would be great for this,
but Curtis Hanson is directing.

11:30.148 --> 11:31.138
Vince loves Curtis.

11:31.233 --> 11:33.315
And we already have
an offer out to someone.

11:33.652 --> 11:35.313
- I hope to close today.
- Motherfucker.

11:35.404 --> 11:36.690
<i>- Who'?
- Heath Ledger.</i>

11:40.284 --> 11:41.615
Sorry, Ari.

11:42.786 --> 11:44.242
But this is good.

11:44.830 --> 11:48.323
Lay off the icing, Dana. Looks like
your hips could use a breather.

11:54.673 --> 11:57.131
Lloyd, I need information
on Heath Ledger.

11:57.426 --> 11:59.087
44-inch chest, Aries,

11:59.177 --> 12:00.793
and he loves rainy days
and black-and-white movies.

12:01.138 --> 12:03.129
Who represents him, Lloyd?

12:06.476 --> 12:07.602
Josh Weinstein.

12:07.936 --> 12:09.802
- FUCK you!
- FUCK you!

12:10.147 --> 12:12.354
Sorry, Ari, that was a reflex.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.276
(LAUGHS)
This is gonna be easier than I thought.

12:14.359 --> 12:15.440
What is?

12:15.527 --> 12:16.733
You have any queen spies
at the Weinstein office?

12:16.820 --> 12:19.403
I have spies at every office, Ari.
Doctors, lawyers--

12:19.489 --> 12:20.570
Find out
where he's eating lunch today.

12:20.657 --> 12:21.738
What are you up to, Ari?

12:21.825 --> 12:23.691
Sabotage, Lloyd. Agency 101.

12:24.036 --> 12:25.367
Oh, goody.

12:25.704 --> 12:27.661
We haven't had a stealth adventure
in a while.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.906
You know I don't smoke weed
during the work season.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.035
Yeah, but you heard the doc.

12:31.126 --> 12:33.037
He said you're nervous.
You ought to try something.

12:33.170 --> 12:35.081
Turtle, if you wanted the weed,
why didn't you get the card?

12:35.172 --> 12:36.708
I just wanted to see
if something happened to you first.

12:36.798 --> 12:39.836
Well, nothing did.
Check out that bad boy right there.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.793
Impressive. What's wrong with you?

12:41.929 --> 12:44.341
- Panic disorder.
- I'll buy that.

12:46.516 --> 12:48.302
Yo, where the hats at?

12:54.858 --> 12:56.440
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh!

12:56.610 --> 12:58.271
Hey, can I help you guys?

12:58.362 --> 13:01.024
Yes, what's the largest
amount that one can legally--

13:01.323 --> 13:03.064
with the card-- purchase?

13:03.158 --> 13:05.900
- How much do they need?
- Maybe <i>2</i> lbs.

13:06.203 --> 13:09.571
Listen, just give him the most you can
of the strongest you got.

13:10.040 --> 13:13.374
Me, I'll take one jet-black
California homegrown trucker hat.

13:13.460 --> 13:16.168
No bag necessary.
I'll be wearing it out.

13:19.549 --> 13:22.712
Oh, yeah. Now I'm ready for work.

13:23.553 --> 13:24.543
Me too.

13:25.305 --> 13:28.468
Vinnie, Vinnie, that little
cunt sucker-punched me, man,

13:28.892 --> 13:30.678
the biggest bitch move in the world.

13:30.769 --> 13:32.555
Billy, you did scream
he likes to suck cock.

13:32.646 --> 13:35.638
I want that little undersized douche
in the ring anytime, anywhere.

13:35.899 --> 13:37.560
Billy, this is getting ridiculous.

13:37.651 --> 13:38.732
No, what's ridiculous

13:38.819 --> 13:40.651
is that one of the producers
of our film seems intent

13:40.737 --> 13:42.603
- <i>on taking it</i> down.
<i>- Taking it down?</i>

13:42.781 --> 13:44.897
The whole town
is freaking over the trailer.

13:44.992 --> 13:46.357
Yo, I wasn't ready yet.

13:46.451 --> 13:48.783
Well, either way,
I'm telling you he did not leak it.

13:48.912 --> 13:51.074
Get him on a lie detector then.
I'll pay for the thing.

13:51.707 --> 13:52.742
Oh, Billy, come on.

13:52.833 --> 13:53.868
You don't doubt him
even for a minute?

13:53.959 --> 13:56.326
The guy tried to sell
our movie behind your back.

13:56.420 --> 13:58.127
Billy, he's like my brother.

13:58.255 --> 14:01.498
I've known him since I'm six years old.
I have zero doubt.

14:01.591 --> 14:03.127
<i>You understand?</i>

14:03.760 --> 14:05.797
I do. You're a loyal guy,
and I respect that.

14:05.887 --> 14:07.798
So please respect that
I need you there tonight.

14:08.056 --> 14:09.888
And I need you both
to get along during this interview

14:09.975 --> 14:11.636
<i>for the sake of the movie.</i>

14:11.727 --> 14:14.014
Okay, Vince, for you
and for the movie, but you tell him,

14:14.104 --> 14:17.517
one look, one word, one smirk,
and he's going down hard.

14:17.607 --> 14:20.645
I'll see you there. It's all good.

14:20.902 --> 14:22.028
He understands
it's all about the movie.

14:22.112 --> 14:24.194
- He's gonna be on his best behavior.
- Yeah, well, he better be.

14:29.244 --> 14:30.860
There he is. There he is.

14:30.954 --> 14:33.036
Keep the moistness out of your pants,
Lloyd, and just wait.

14:33.123 --> 14:35.490
Let him see us.
Let him come to us, all right?

14:37.294 --> 14:40.286
Hey, Ari, how are you?
What, we still got beef?

14:40.505 --> 14:43.668
No beef, Josh.
This is my assistant Lloyd.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.258
- Hey.
- Josh used to be you, Lloyd.

14:46.386 --> 14:49.924
Oh, Josh Weinstein.
Ari's always yelling at me,

14:50.098 --> 14:52.760
"Lloyd, why can't you be
more like Josh Weinstein?"

14:52.934 --> 14:54.641
Really? That's cool.

14:54.811 --> 14:56.142
ARI: What are you up to, Josh?

14:56.229 --> 14:58.607
Nothing much, man,
just working with Heath.

14:59.191 --> 15:01.398
- Ledger-- I'm sure you've heard.
- I did not hear.

15:01.485 --> 15:03.772
No, but that's fantastic.
Terrific. I love Heath.

15:03.862 --> 15:05.978
Oh yeah. He's huge, and he's mine.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.229
Mmm.

15:07.324 --> 15:08.439
Ari, you would have been
so proud of me.

15:08.533 --> 15:10.069
- It was just how you taught me.
- Yeah?

15:10.160 --> 15:11.525
- I was in a Team Ledger meeting,
- Uh-huh?

15:11.620 --> 15:14.533
Threw out a couple of suggestions--
oh, did his point guy get pissed!

15:14.623 --> 15:16.580
- (LAUGHS)
- But Heath loved my ideas.

15:16.666 --> 15:19.078
Barn! Now he only listens
to what I say.

15:19.169 --> 15:20.955
Where are you
steering him now, Josh?

15:21.046 --> 15:23.287
We're about to close
on "Lost in the Clouds."

15:23.924 --> 15:25.005
Really?

15:25.092 --> 15:26.378
Yeah, what? You don't like it?

15:26.468 --> 15:28.300
No no no, you know,
I shouldn't say anything.

15:28.386 --> 15:31.424
Excuse me, miss, uh,
could we be seated now? Thanks.

15:31.515 --> 15:33.301
- Right this way, Mr. Gold.
- All right.

15:33.642 --> 15:35.804
Are you just being a hater,
or you really got something to say?

15:35.894 --> 15:37.885
Listen, do you really want
Heath up on another mountain

15:38.021 --> 15:39.523
playing gay again? I mean, come on,

15:39.606 --> 15:41.938
"Brokeback" is still in people's minds.

15:42.025 --> 15:43.481
Very much so.

15:44.611 --> 15:47.194
Gay? What are you talking about, Ari?

15:47.280 --> 15:49.066
This is supposed to be
a badass mountain climber.

15:49.157 --> 15:50.272
Maybe. Did you read the book, Josh?

15:50.367 --> 15:52.449
I mean, there is a reason why
he chose the handsome Sherpa

15:52.536 --> 15:55.278
who was educated at Oxford
to show him up the mountain.

15:56.164 --> 15:58.280
I was thinking about The Rock
for the Sherpa.

15:58.375 --> 16:00.082
<i>Om. (GUFFAWS)</i>

16:00.710 --> 16:03.543
There is an image. Look, Josh, I don't
mean to tell you your business,

16:03.630 --> 16:06.213
but what do you think they were
doing in that cave for two weeks?

16:06.633 --> 16:09.045
They were using each other's asses
as hand warmers.

16:09.386 --> 16:11.969
The love affair--
it's the subtext of the whole script,

16:12.055 --> 16:13.966
even if it doesn't
overtly make the movie.

16:14.099 --> 16:17.057
I think Heath and The Rock
will make a hot couple, Josh.

16:17.394 --> 16:18.759
I wouldn't worry about it at all.

16:18.854 --> 16:20.219
You've got my $10.50.

16:21.731 --> 16:23.938
I gotta go call Heath.
Excuse me, guys.

16:24.025 --> 16:25.402
Sorry, 9W5-

16:26.278 --> 16:27.814
- What do you think?
- (CHUCKLES)

16:27.904 --> 16:30.896
When you told me your plan,
I thought it was simple and stupid.

16:30.991 --> 16:33.824
- Uh-huh, and now?
- Brilliant and complex.

16:33.910 --> 16:35.821
There you go.
A couple of shots, huh, Lloyd?

16:35.912 --> 16:37.414
Okay, Ari Gold, okay.

16:37.622 --> 16:40.740
Excuse me, miss, can we get
a couple of woo-woos over here?

16:40.917 --> 16:42.828
What the fuck is a woo-woo?

16:42.919 --> 16:43.909
Woo-woo!

16:47.757 --> 16:49.964
- Hey, Johnny.
- Hey, gorgeous.

16:50.177 --> 16:53.340
- What up, playas?
- Looking good, Johnny Drama.

16:53.597 --> 16:55.008
Feeling good, J.J., feeling good.

16:55.098 --> 16:56.839
Hey, Angela, how's it hanging, baby?

16:56.933 --> 16:58.310
Hey, Johnny. How was your hiatus?

16:58.393 --> 17:00.384
Any better-- I'd be guilty.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.012
Gary! Yo!

17:03.857 --> 17:06.565
- Drama, what up, dawg?
- What up, biatches?

17:06.651 --> 17:08.028
Johnny, what's up, man?
You look good.

17:08.111 --> 17:09.693
- Yeah?
- Yeah. You lose weight or what?

17:09.779 --> 17:12.771
Maybe a couple pounds. I've been
hitting the gym, doing two a day.

17:12.866 --> 17:14.698
Nice.
Hey, we should work out sometime.

17:14.951 --> 17:17.157
If you think
you can keep up with my regimen.

17:17.244 --> 17:19.327
Yo, man, that's a sweet hat.

17:20.207 --> 17:21.538
- This old thing?
- Yeah.

17:21.625 --> 17:23.366
- It's a'ight.
- A'ight? Dude, it's awesome.

17:23.501 --> 17:24.957
Killer, man.

17:25.045 --> 17:27.207
That's from that medical
marijuana joint, huh, Drama?

17:27.297 --> 17:28.287
Yeah.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.883
Dude, I hear they got
the illest OG Kush there.

17:29.966 --> 17:33.084
Let's just say
membership has its privileges.

17:33.178 --> 17:35.419
Nice, Drama. Dude,
you just turned this

17:35.513 --> 17:37.220
into one very sweet new season.

17:37.307 --> 17:38.763
- Yeah?
- Fuck yeah, dude.

17:38.850 --> 17:40.807
Yo, what the hell
we waitin' for, boys?

17:40.894 --> 17:42.680
Let's hit Drama's trailer, spark it up.

17:42.771 --> 17:44.387
- Come on.
- Uh...

17:44.981 --> 17:47.473
Don't even tell me
you didn't bring any for us, Drama.

17:47.692 --> 17:49.558
Of course I did. It's in the car.

17:49.653 --> 17:50.768
- Yeah!
- Yeah, all right!

17:50.862 --> 17:53.069
- I'll go get it.
- All right!

17:54.658 --> 17:57.195
Dude, he's the man. We're hooking up.

18:11.341 --> 18:13.548
- Yo.
- Yo, did you finish all my weed?

18:13.677 --> 18:15.088
<i>Nah, not all of it.</i>

18:15.178 --> 18:17.670
I need you on the set
with whatever's left, now.

18:17.764 --> 18:20.347
I'm not moving too fast, Drama.
This is some powerful shit.

18:20.517 --> 18:22.178
Now, Turtle, now!

18:25.605 --> 18:26.766
- Vince.
- Hey, Elvis.

18:26.856 --> 18:28.062
- How are you?
- Great.

18:28.149 --> 18:29.890
Good to see you.
Haven't seen you since Sundance.

18:29.985 --> 18:31.475
- Yeah, that's right.
- How have you been?

18:31.569 --> 18:32.821
- Very well. And you?
- Good.

18:32.904 --> 18:34.690
This is my producer
and manager, Eric Murphy.

18:34.823 --> 18:36.154
- Nice to meet you, Elvis.
- How are you?

18:36.241 --> 18:37.857
- I'm well. How are you?
- I'm good, thanks.

18:37.951 --> 18:40.409
And here's Mr. Walsh now.

18:40.704 --> 18:42.411
Mr. Mitchell.

18:42.497 --> 18:44.864
- Pleasure to meet you.
- How are you?

18:45.500 --> 18:46.740
So, uh...

18:47.210 --> 18:49.793
how charming
do we have to be to get the cover?

18:49.879 --> 18:51.540
(ELVIS CHUCKLES)

18:52.799 --> 18:55.006
<i>- Who told you, Ari?
- Told me what, Dana?</i>

18:55.135 --> 18:56.876
<i>What are you talking about?
I was just calling to apologize.</i>

18:56.970 --> 18:59.211
You know, I thought maybe
I was a little rude earlier.

18:59.306 --> 19:01.047
- Brian grazer, how are you, man?
- Yeah. Hey.

19:01.141 --> 19:02.131
Good to see you.

19:02.225 --> 19:03.386
Listen, the real "American Gangster."
Everything good?

19:03.476 --> 19:04.978
Yeah, it's good,
but I'll see you in a while.

19:05.061 --> 19:07.223
Yes, you will. Can we put
Vinnie and Russell together?

19:07.897 --> 19:08.887
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

19:08.982 --> 19:09.972
We will. Dana, listen,

19:10.066 --> 19:12.182
I know that deep down
my behavior really turns you on,

19:12.277 --> 19:14.689
<i>but in case it really doesn't,
then yes, I am sorry.</i>

19:14.779 --> 19:17.567
Whatever.
Heath's off "Lost in the Clouds."

19:19.075 --> 19:20.577
- Really?
- Yeah, <i>it turns</i> out

19:20.660 --> 19:23.322
he's got some passion project
he wants to direct.

19:23.413 --> 19:26.371
A very interesting
turn of events out of nowhere.

19:26.458 --> 19:28.665
<i>And an even stranger one
that I'm calling you now.</i>

19:28.752 --> 19:30.459
Well, you tell Curtis that Vinnie is in.

19:31.087 --> 19:33.419
(CHUCKLES) You know, I would love to,

19:33.506 --> 19:35.167
but Curtis is out.

19:35.800 --> 19:38.633
<i>Wanted to only work with Heath on this
and no one else.</i>

19:38.845 --> 19:40.711
Jesus. Uh, so now what?

19:40.889 --> 19:43.722
So now my fast-track film
has hit the skids.

19:59.199 --> 20:00.689
Oh yeah, baby.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.570
<i>MAN". Whoo! Yeah!</i>

20:02.952 --> 20:05.205
Take it easy, Drama.
That shit's strong.

20:05.288 --> 20:07.199
Hey, everyone,
Turtle here thinks he's my dad,

20:07.290 --> 20:08.951
thinks I should slow down.

20:09.459 --> 20:11.541
Don't worry, bro, he's cool.

20:12.170 --> 20:13.956
See, Turtle? I'm cool.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.088
- MAN: Yeah.
- All right, I'm up.

20:16.174 --> 20:18.461
- You just went, Drama.
- Just hit me, bitch.

20:18.551 --> 20:21.634
- It's not your turn, Drama.
- Just fucking hit me, man.

20:21.763 --> 20:23.754
You don't have any cards, Drama.

20:23.848 --> 20:26.101
Well, get me some
motherfucking cards then, son.

20:27.268 --> 20:28.804
All right, dawg.

20:30.480 --> 20:31.561
Ooh.

20:32.315 --> 20:33.476
Hit me.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.857
ALL: Oh!

20:36.152 --> 20:37.358
Strip or smoke.

20:37.445 --> 20:39.277
Well, there's no way
I'm taking these boxers off

20:39.656 --> 20:42.114
and humiliating
all the other men in here, so...

20:42.492 --> 20:44.324
- I'll strip for you.
- (MEN CHEER)

20:44.577 --> 20:46.193
I'll take that...

20:46.329 --> 20:48.320
and I'll smoke. Pack that shit tight.

20:48.415 --> 20:51.498
- (CHEERING)
- You're out of your mind, Drama.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.659
Smoke smoke smoke...

Are you okay, Drama?

21:12.939 --> 21:13.974
What?

21:14.065 --> 21:15.521
Are you okay?

21:18.069 --> 21:20.276
Why is everyone looking at me?

21:20.363 --> 21:21.444
'Cause you're talking.

21:21.531 --> 21:24.193
- I'm not talking, you're talking.
- Relax, Drama.

21:24.451 --> 21:27.068
I can't relax.
My pulse is skyrocketing.

21:27.287 --> 21:29.574
- Check my pulse.
- Oh shit, dude.

21:29.664 --> 21:31.450
Someone is bugging out.

21:31.541 --> 21:33.703
I'm not bugging out. My mouth
is just dry. I need some water.

21:34.210 --> 21:36.201
But out! Bug out! Bug out...

21:40.467 --> 21:42.708
No, I'm not bugging out. Give me water.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.885
Someone get me some water.
Get me some water!

21:46.055 --> 21:47.716
Bug out! Bug out...

21:48.600 --> 21:50.841
Turtle, why won't they help me?

21:52.145 --> 21:54.682
Why don't you just help yourself
and embrace it?

21:55.732 --> 21:58.224
Yeah, I'm bugging out.

21:58.401 --> 22:00.392
- Yeah.
- I'm bugging out!

22:01.446 --> 22:02.857
(CHEERING)

22:06.993 --> 22:08.950
<i>ALL". Smoke smoke smoke-J</i>

22:09.787 --> 22:12.040
So we're standing
on the side of this mountain

22:12.123 --> 22:15.411
overlooking this place
that Pablo Escobar terrorized

22:15.919 --> 22:18.126
over a decade, and we're going,

22:18.713 --> 22:22.502
"What is the flaw in humanity
that makes people act so cruel?"

22:22.592 --> 22:24.879
- Elvis, it was amazing.
- It was very inspiring.

22:24.969 --> 22:26.755
- Mm-hmm.
- What did you think, Eric?

22:26.930 --> 22:28.671
Oh, Eric wasn't there.

22:28.765 --> 22:30.426
I was at base camp
preparing for the next scene.

22:30.517 --> 22:32.474
Eric wasn't necessarily on set a lot.

22:32.560 --> 22:34.551
<i>I was wherever I needed to be,
wherever that</i> was.

22:34.646 --> 22:35.977
Eric has the toughest job

22:36.064 --> 22:37.850
and he'll probably
get the least amount of credit.

22:38.024 --> 22:41.312
But he's the smallest so he doesn't
need as much credit as big people.

22:42.403 --> 22:44.861
Yeah. Then again, my ego
isn't half as big as Billy's.

22:44.948 --> 22:47.440
Shit, Simon Cowell's ego isn't as big.

22:47.951 --> 22:50.488
- You guys have an amazing rapport.
- Don't they?

22:50.578 --> 22:52.535
The three of you.
Did you all grow up together?

22:52.622 --> 22:54.204
No, just me and E.

22:54.582 --> 22:56.573
"Tiny E"-- that's our nickname for him.

22:56.668 --> 22:59.456
- You can print that.

(ALL CHUCKLE)

23:03.174 --> 23:04.209
Thanks again, guys.

23:04.300 --> 23:05.381
- ERIC: Take care, Elvis.
- VINCE: Thank you.

23:05.468 --> 23:07.379
- Good luck at Cannes.
- Thank you.

23:07.887 --> 23:10.549
- You fucking prick.
- Lick my balls, bitch.

23:10.640 --> 23:13.052
What, you want me to whip your ass
again, you fucking hack?

23:13.142 --> 23:15.930
- Hack? Let's go, right here.
- Yeah, you're a fucking hack.

23:16.020 --> 23:17.931
Shut the fuck up!

23:18.189 --> 23:19.475
Seriously.

23:19.607 --> 23:22.315
E, get in the fucking car. Go.

23:24.445 --> 23:25.731
You'd better run, pussy.

23:25.822 --> 23:27.153
- Run?
- E.

23:31.202 --> 23:33.489
I'm sorry, man. I just hate him.

23:33.997 --> 23:35.032
Talk to you later, Billy.

23:35.123 --> 23:37.160
Don't be mad at me, Vinnie.

23:38.167 --> 23:41.034
Drive away now. Drive away
if you know what's good for you.

23:41.129 --> 23:42.836
- Are you fucking serious?
- Oh, what, it's me?

23:43.006 --> 23:45.748
Walsh is a mess. I mean, look at him.
He's a crazy artist.

23:45.842 --> 23:47.674
- Arghh-hh-hh!
- VINCE: You're not.

23:47.760 --> 23:50.297
You're supposed to have
your head on your shoulders, right?

23:51.264 --> 23:54.006
Right.
No, you're right, Vince, I'm sorry.

23:55.184 --> 23:56.640
But six more weeks and that's it.

23:56.728 --> 23:58.264
We finish posting this movie,
we go to Cannes,

23:58.354 --> 24:00.766
and then I never see
or speak to this fuck again, ever.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.317
- Fine.
- Fine.

- Hey, what's up, Ari?

24:04.819 --> 24:06.901
Who wants to climb
Mount Annapurna?

24:07.280 --> 24:08.270
We got it?

24:08.364 --> 24:09.570
- We got it.
- That's sick.

24:09.699 --> 24:12.908
No, what's sick is
I also got E on as a producer.

24:13.161 --> 24:14.572
- Nice.
- How did you do that?

24:14.662 --> 24:16.994
By using the hype to sell them
the dream-team package.

24:17.081 --> 24:18.333
Oh yeah? Who's the dream team?

24:18.416 --> 24:20.874
<i>Team "Medellin," baby. Vinnie stars,</i>

24:21.044 --> 24:23.035
you produce, Walsh directs.

24:23.212 --> 24:24.293
