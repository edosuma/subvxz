WEBVTT

00:02.500 --> 00:04.117
Let there be light.

00:04.781 --> 00:07.660
I can't believe you waited three
months to tell me about this.

00:07.684 --> 00:10.414
In my defense, it's not like
you and I have always had

00:10.439 --> 00:12.905
the best tenant-slash-
building-manager relationship.

00:12.930 --> 00:14.289
Your first week here, you said,

00:14.314 --> 00:16.241
"Ma'am, will you help me
hang my shower drapes?"

00:16.265 --> 00:17.680
I don't know which to
be offended by more,

00:17.704 --> 00:20.132
you calling me "ma'am"
or you calling them "shower drapes."

00:21.079 --> 00:22.203
What would you call them?

00:22.228 --> 00:24.560
Curtains, Zoey. They're curtains.

00:24.585 --> 00:25.710
You need a new part.

00:25.735 --> 00:28.403
I'll hit up the hardware store
right after I get my manicure.

00:32.052 --> 00:35.101
Dear God, is this job really
worth the cheaper rent?

00:37.647 --> 00:39.124
What are you giggling at?

00:39.149 --> 00:42.164
Simon and I are helping
each other make me-mojis.

00:42.189 --> 00:43.601
Does that really look like me?

00:43.626 --> 00:45.117
All I see is a single lady

00:45.142 --> 00:47.320
texting an engaged man before 9 A.M.

00:47.798 --> 00:49.648
This is just innocent fun.

00:49.673 --> 00:52.070
Said no innocent person ever.

00:53.926 --> 00:55.875
- I can see your side-eye.
- Good.

00:58.585 --> 01:00.031
Morning, Bonnie.

01:00.056 --> 01:02.140
Wait. Someone actually lives there?

01:02.165 --> 01:03.680
I've been in this
building for two years,

01:03.704 --> 01:05.421
and I've never seen
anybody go in or out.

01:05.446 --> 01:06.929
Shh. Bonnie's agoraphobic,

01:06.954 --> 01:08.257
so I deliver her mail

01:08.282 --> 01:10.687
and occasionally read
to her through her door.

01:10.712 --> 01:13.458
I've never heard a peep,
but it's probably good practice

01:13.483 --> 01:15.667
for when I finally record my audiobook.

01:15.692 --> 01:17.058
Poor Bonnie.

01:18.280 --> 01:20.158
She must be so lonely.

01:20.183 --> 01:22.421
Can you imagine
living your life like that?

01:22.446 --> 01:24.324
I can't imagine hiding
myself from the world.

01:24.349 --> 01:27.476
I'm a Leo, baby, brave, bold, beautiful!

01:27.787 --> 01:29.314
And I'm...

01:29.339 --> 01:31.414
whatever a Capricorn is.

01:31.978 --> 01:34.452
It's too bad we can't all be like you.

02:59.930 --> 03:01.510
You just sang to me,

03:01.535 --> 03:03.146
like in a heart-song way,

03:03.171 --> 03:04.982
not in like a condescending

03:05.007 --> 03:07.603
"I'm gonna teach you
the power of music" kind of way.

03:07.628 --> 03:08.905
I didn't feel anything.

03:08.930 --> 03:10.916
Eh, I'm telling you it happened.

03:11.237 --> 03:13.924
Here's the bad news.
Your song was kind of sad.

03:13.949 --> 03:16.182
And what was it you thought
you heard me singing?

03:16.207 --> 03:17.783
I'm gonna take a shot in the dark

03:17.808 --> 03:19.322
and say "The Great Pretender."

03:19.347 --> 03:22.346
According to the lyrics,
you're pretending you're well,

03:22.371 --> 03:26.182
but, at the same time,
you're, like, super lonely.

03:26.207 --> 03:27.451
Should we unpack that?

03:27.476 --> 03:29.368
No, because I didn't sing it.

03:29.393 --> 03:30.401
If I'm gonna sing anything,

03:30.425 --> 03:32.533
it's gonna be something like
"Walking on Sunshine,"

03:32.558 --> 03:34.836
and there'd be a montage of
me trying on cute clothes.

03:34.861 --> 03:35.995
I don't know. I really think...

03:36.019 --> 03:37.994
I really think your
power is on the fritz, girl.

03:38.019 --> 03:40.455
Now, if you'll excuse me,

03:40.480 --> 03:43.369
I have to snake a toilet
in apartment seven.

03:47.443 --> 03:49.502
Quick. Feel something strongly,

03:49.527 --> 03:51.603
but don't tell me
about it. Just think it.

03:51.628 --> 03:53.603
Did you just learn a new magic trick?

03:53.628 --> 03:55.752
Just work with me, Simon, okay?

03:56.111 --> 03:59.807
What is bothering you on the inside?

04:03.277 --> 04:04.688
I'm kind of pissed at the florist

04:04.713 --> 04:07.158
for our engagement
party. Does that count?

04:07.183 --> 04:08.831
- What happened?
- He totally bailed on us.

04:08.855 --> 04:11.338
Jessica is livid,
and I'm kinda scared for the guy,

04:11.363 --> 04:13.347
because she will find him,
and she does not fight fair.

04:13.371 --> 04:15.003
If you need somebody,
you should call my mom.

04:15.027 --> 04:16.392
She's a landscape architect,

04:16.416 --> 04:18.243
but that's florist adjacent-adjacent.

04:18.267 --> 04:20.064
I'm sure she could give
you some solid recs.

04:20.089 --> 04:21.298
God bless you.

04:21.324 --> 04:24.471
Godspeed to you.

04:24.827 --> 04:28.853
Uh, I will give her a heads-up
and text you her info.

04:28.878 --> 04:29.939
Thank you.

04:32.894 --> 04:36.307
Sorry, Zoey. I'm just making
a smoothie for your dad.

04:36.332 --> 04:38.644
But if you're saying what
I think you're saying,

04:38.669 --> 04:40.463
just have your friend call me.

04:40.488 --> 04:42.323
Instant gratification
is not what we're after.

04:42.347 --> 04:44.174
I don't do surprises. Hand it over.

04:44.199 --> 04:46.377
Hey, you two. Play nice,

04:46.402 --> 04:48.147
or I'm gonna take your toy away.

04:48.172 --> 04:50.986
Be my guest, and then will
you please open the damn thing

04:51.011 --> 04:52.627
and let me know what it says inside?

04:52.652 --> 04:54.236
We went to the OB-GYN this morning,

04:54.261 --> 04:56.775
and the baby's gender
results are in here.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.244
- Open it!
- No!

04:58.269 --> 04:59.439
- Come on.
- Oh, see?

04:59.464 --> 05:01.167
Now you got her involved.
I need two of you?

05:01.191 --> 05:03.172
- Maggie, I agree.
- Yeah.

05:03.197 --> 05:04.599
David.

05:04.624 --> 05:07.136
He wants to wait until
this whatever you are

05:07.168 --> 05:10.099
pops out of me to find out
if it's a boy or a girl,

05:10.124 --> 05:12.035
but why would we want to do that?

05:12.060 --> 05:15.506
Well, because it's exciting,
surprising, more fun.

05:15.531 --> 05:18.510
And try impractical,
inconvenient, patience testing.

05:18.535 --> 05:20.326
- I could go on, babe.
- Please don't.

05:20.351 --> 05:22.295
Oh, I'm with Emily on this.

05:22.320 --> 05:26.000
- You are wasting precious time.
- Exactly.

05:26.025 --> 05:27.956
Hey, Dad, you want to weigh in on this?

05:30.373 --> 05:32.513
"Pass." He's just being polite, okay?

05:32.538 --> 05:35.357
We all know that Dad always
votes on the side of...

05:35.382 --> 05:37.761
Bigger moments, bigger memories.

05:37.786 --> 05:40.123
- Yes.
- All right, how 'bout this?

05:40.148 --> 05:43.076
I agree to wait until
we're in the delivery room

05:43.101 --> 05:46.638
if you agree to rub my
feet and/or shoulders

05:46.663 --> 05:47.896
every night 'til then.

05:47.921 --> 05:50.142
Deal. But I have to warn you,

05:50.167 --> 05:51.812
- it... it might get a little bit...
- It won't get sexual.

05:51.836 --> 05:52.879
No? No?

05:52.904 --> 05:54.983
- No.
- Yeah, okay.

05:55.008 --> 05:58.154
Are you sure that you're
okay with me leaving?

05:58.179 --> 05:59.983
It's totally fine. I
talked to the office.

06:00.008 --> 06:01.703
They're cool with me
working here for the week,

06:01.727 --> 06:03.105
and it'll give Dad and I a chance

06:03.130 --> 06:04.851
to have some good
father-son quality time.

06:04.876 --> 06:05.999
Right.

06:06.521 --> 06:08.022
Thank you.

06:09.514 --> 06:13.465
Then, I guess I will just go
do this whole me-time thing

06:13.490 --> 06:16.280
that you and Zoey seem to want so badly.

06:16.305 --> 06:17.838
I just, um...

06:20.509 --> 06:23.655
... have to figure out
what it is me wants to do.

06:34.730 --> 06:36.288
Oh, hi, Joan. How's it going?

06:36.313 --> 06:38.047
Oh, great. Super great.

06:38.765 --> 06:40.304
- Glad to hear it.
- Mm-hmm.

06:40.329 --> 06:42.265
Does that mean you and Charlie...

06:42.290 --> 06:43.999
Are basically dead to each other? Yeah.

06:44.609 --> 06:46.515
Oh, okay.

06:46.540 --> 06:47.851
- Congratulations?
- Right?

06:47.876 --> 06:49.328
I mean, he's been living at the hotel.

06:49.352 --> 06:50.763
I haven't reached out once.

06:50.788 --> 06:52.476
This new chapter of my life is all about

06:52.501 --> 06:55.116
making healthy choices,
and I have never felt better.

06:55.141 --> 06:57.421
I swam a half-mile in
the Bay this morning,

06:57.446 --> 06:59.944
I'm flying my herbalist
in from Shanghai,

06:59.969 --> 07:03.804
and, thanks to my new no-carb,
high-protein food regimen,

07:03.829 --> 07:07.186
I am focused and energized
and fully in ketosis.

07:07.211 --> 07:09.022
I wish I had a husband of 20 years

07:09.047 --> 07:11.319
I suddenly became estranged from.

07:11.344 --> 07:13.218
Oh, give it time.

07:13.243 --> 07:15.523
I don't know that I would have
had the courage to go through it

07:15.547 --> 07:17.640
without your naive boundary overstepping

07:17.665 --> 07:19.543
and your optimistic meddling.

07:20.163 --> 07:21.632
I appreciate that?

07:21.657 --> 07:25.163
Enjoy your croissant and your twist.

08:12.322 --> 08:14.657
Autumn and I did make our first love.

08:14.801 --> 08:16.211
How did you know that?

08:16.236 --> 08:17.714
Women's intuition.

08:17.739 --> 08:20.251
A power that's seemingly
working just fine,

08:21.678 --> 08:23.297
Well, that's not all.

08:23.322 --> 08:24.744

08:24.768 --> 08:27.299
in Napa this weekend and our third love

08:27.324 --> 08:29.039
- and our fourth.
- You can take the fifth

08:29.064 --> 08:30.602
and stop telling me about it.

08:30.627 --> 08:32.104
Okay. Jeez.

08:32.129 --> 08:33.438
I'm sorry.

08:33.462 --> 08:35.341
Uh, Napa?

08:35.366 --> 08:36.625
Like a couple's trip.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.063
Mm-hmm.

08:38.403 --> 08:40.907
That's kind of a big step.

08:41.196 --> 08:42.532
What?

08:42.557 --> 08:44.249
Do you think it's too soon?

08:44.274 --> 08:46.852
No. I'm happy for you.

08:47.227 --> 08:51.664
And it seems like your feelings
for Autumn are just soaring,

08:51.827 --> 08:53.672
operatically so.

08:53.860 --> 08:55.321
Is it that obvious?

08:55.346 --> 08:57.480
You could tone it down a little bit.

09:03.236 --> 09:04.636
Hey, Mo?

09:06.131 --> 09:07.485
My powers are working just fine,

09:07.510 --> 09:08.889
so maybe we should get to the bottom

09:08.913 --> 09:10.657
of that song you sang to me earlier,

09:10.682 --> 09:13.461

I'm gonna assume

10:11.509 --> 10:15.305
there's not a karaoke
party going on in there.

10:17.793 --> 10:21.664
So maybe I'm just
picking up on your vibe,

12:10.041 --> 12:12.385
You had no right following me here.

12:12.724 --> 12:14.302
That might be true.

12:14.327 --> 12:16.587
But I heard you singing
"The Great Pretender" again,

12:16.612 --> 12:19.767
and then you came here dressed like
I've never seen you dress before,

12:19.792 --> 12:21.791
so clearly something's going on.

12:21.816 --> 12:23.916
That song, whether I sang it or not,

12:23.941 --> 12:26.186
is an expression of my private feelings.

12:26.211 --> 12:28.589
Emphasis on the "you shouldn't
even be here right now."

12:28.614 --> 12:30.306
Do you have to dress
like a man at church?

12:30.331 --> 12:31.783
Is that, like, required?

12:31.808 --> 12:34.056
I can dress however I
want whenever I want, Zoey.

12:34.081 --> 12:35.511
But you don't dress
like that anywhere else.

12:35.535 --> 12:37.791
Let she without sin
cast the first stone.

12:37.816 --> 12:41.447
- I don't know what that means.
- It means don't judge me.

12:41.543 --> 12:43.713
So maybe I don't feel
exactly comfortable

12:43.738 --> 12:45.385
being my true self here. So what?

12:45.410 --> 12:47.517
I just feel like you wouldn't
have sung that song to me

12:47.541 --> 12:49.189
unless this was really bothering you.

12:49.214 --> 12:51.158
How do you know how
I feel when I'm here?

12:51.183 --> 12:52.713
Are you religious?

12:53.182 --> 12:55.885
Do you know anything about faith at all?

12:56.153 --> 12:58.721
- No.
- Then, please go.

12:58.746 --> 13:01.025
And the next time you
hear my heart singing,

13:01.050 --> 13:02.463
stop listening.

13:02.526 --> 13:04.659
I don't want you in my audience.

13:14.679 --> 13:18.291
I could get you guys a
couple of Japanese maples.

13:19.027 --> 13:21.471
Zoey, look who stopped by.

13:21.496 --> 13:23.338
Ah, Zoey, I can't tell you

13:23.363 --> 13:25.385
how much you saved
our lives with Maggie.

13:25.410 --> 13:28.111
And the life of the
florist who bailed on us.

13:29.044 --> 13:31.408
Uh, that is so great.

13:31.433 --> 13:32.635
I'm sorry.

13:33.088 --> 13:36.213
Um, what's happening here?

13:36.238 --> 13:38.431
I reached out to your
mom for recommendations,

13:38.456 --> 13:40.134
and then she started
asking about the party,

13:40.158 --> 13:42.136
and when I told her that we're
throwing it in our backyard...

13:42.160 --> 13:45.096
I figured that was the perfect
way to spend my me-time.

13:45.121 --> 13:46.549
And Maggie had so many great ideas,

13:46.574 --> 13:47.963
we just hired her on the spot.

13:47.988 --> 13:50.367
They're just checking out
the yard for inspiration.

13:50.392 --> 13:54.666
And I am inspired by this and, ah, that.

13:54.691 --> 13:55.768
Something like that would be

13:55.792 --> 13:58.275
such an incredible
photo-op for our guests.

13:58.609 --> 14:00.642
I could definitely
make you one of those.

14:00.667 --> 14:02.799
- What do you think, hon?
- Sounds good to me.

14:02.824 --> 14:05.408
He's handsome and accommodating.

14:05.667 --> 14:07.071
I trained him well.

14:13.024 --> 14:15.275
All right, that's enough PDA

14:15.300 --> 14:16.916
from the annoying engaged couple.

14:17.503 --> 14:19.541
That's right. Tsk, tsk, tsk.

14:19.566 --> 14:21.646
I mean, if you do want to do that,
I would take it...

14:21.981 --> 14:25.736
behind the hydrangeas,
'cause that's what I used to do.

14:25.761 --> 14:27.439
High school.

14:27.581 --> 14:29.281
With boys.

14:38.929 --> 14:42.228
They're lovely.
Thank you for introducing us.

14:43.930 --> 14:45.353
Are you all right?

14:45.378 --> 14:47.260
Yeah. You just...

14:47.754 --> 14:49.549
caught me off guard. That's all.

14:49.574 --> 14:51.556
Should I not have taken this job?

14:51.581 --> 14:54.603
You gave them my number,
so I just thought that...

14:54.628 --> 14:57.346
No, it's okay. You seem excited, so...

14:57.371 --> 14:58.838
I just...

15:00.470 --> 15:02.517
I got in a fight with my friend, Mo,

15:02.542 --> 15:06.471
and, uh, he called me
out on a bunch of faith stuff.

15:06.751 --> 15:09.424
I realized I know
nothing about religion.

15:09.915 --> 15:13.127
Ah, well, you can blame
your lapsed Catholic father

15:13.152 --> 15:16.465
and your perpetually-seeking
mother for that.

15:16.490 --> 15:20.603
I never thought I should impose
any religion on you or David,

15:20.628 --> 15:27.200
because a person's spiritual
quest should be their own.

15:28.538 --> 15:31.603
Yeah, well,
this is very out of my comfort zone.

15:32.018 --> 15:33.838
That makes sense.

15:34.304 --> 15:36.572
There's a lot of grey area to this stuff

15:36.597 --> 15:38.808
that math and science
people like yourself

15:38.833 --> 15:41.679
have a hard time
wrapping your head around.

15:42.510 --> 15:45.674
I guess I didn't even realize
you had so many of these books.

15:45.699 --> 15:48.549
The Koran, Tibetan Book of the Dead,

15:48.574 --> 15:52.635
"Everyday Tarot," The Kama Sutra.

15:52.660 --> 15:54.564
Oh, there that is.

I think we might be vibing again.

16:23.357 --> 16:27.228
I don't know about you, but with
all this crappy weather lately,

16:27.629 --> 16:33.096
a tropical escape does
sound pretty nice right now.

16:33.501 --> 16:35.300
So...

16:36.768 --> 16:38.682
is that what you want?

Hi.

16:50.274 --> 16:52.377
How? Um...

16:53.291 --> 16:57.025
I'm very tuned in to other
people's inner tunes.

- Yeah.

18:17.342 --> 18:18.789
Do you go to temple?

18:18.814 --> 18:21.087

18:21.112 --> 18:22.642
'Cause your family wanted you to?

20:12.135 --> 20:13.509
Are you sure everything's okay with you?

20:13.533 --> 20:16.618
- 'Cause I feel like maybe it's not.
- Yes, oh, my God. I mean,

20:16.643 --> 20:17.821
maybe going through a separation

20:17.845 --> 20:19.275
was not the best time to quit carbs,

20:19.299 --> 20:21.210
but I'm not missing Charlie at all.

20:21.235 --> 20:23.626
- Not even a little bit?
- Mm-mm.

20:24.204 --> 20:27.501
'Cause when you're with
somebody for so long,

20:27.526 --> 20:28.705
- it's only natural...
- You know, we should really

20:28.729 --> 20:31.282
switch this bread bar
out to something else,

20:31.307 --> 20:33.547
a fruit bar, a nut bar, open bar.

20:33.572 --> 20:35.852
Gotta look into the legalities of that.

20:38.151 --> 20:40.860
What's a five-letter
word for "uninspired?"

20:44.001 --> 20:45.040
Bored? No.

20:45.065 --> 20:47.065
That's good, but it starts with an "S."

20:49.713 --> 20:52.204
"No I'm."

20:52.229 --> 20:53.844
I see. You're... You're bored.

20:54.165 --> 20:56.790
It's fine. No more crossword, then.

21:00.392 --> 21:05.774
Um, I wasn't sure when the
best time to bring this up was,

21:05.799 --> 21:08.954
but since I'm gonna be a dad soon,

21:08.979 --> 21:10.957
I thought, um...

21:11.182 --> 21:12.960
I just thought maybe you might have

21:12.985 --> 21:15.008
some advice on being a parent.

21:15.033 --> 21:17.032
Whatever you got, I'm happy to take.

21:17.057 --> 21:19.532
I know it's gonna take
some time to spell it out,

21:19.557 --> 21:22.091
but we're not going anywhere, so...

21:23.344 --> 21:24.907
"Wedding"...

21:26.602 --> 21:28.247
wedding video?

21:28.600 --> 21:30.077
Oh, your toast.

21:30.101 --> 21:32.336
That's... Okay,
that... That's a great idea.

21:32.361 --> 21:34.047
I've never even watched this thing.

21:34.072 --> 21:36.702
Emily refuses to because of Train-gate.

21:36.727 --> 21:40.672
How Zoey managed to butcher that
beautiful dress is beyond me.

21:40.697 --> 21:43.909
I mean, she had one job...

21:43.934 --> 21:45.254
Fan it.

21:59.407 --> 22:01.141
Look at you, you party animal.

22:01.610 --> 22:03.910
Where is that awesome toast?

22:04.372 --> 22:06.141
Let's see.

22:07.791 --> 22:09.977
Oh, here it is.

22:10.374 --> 22:12.886
<i>Hey, let's hear it for the band.</i>

22:15.104 --> 22:16.157
<i>Thank you, everyone,</i>

22:16.182 --> 22:18.294
<i>for sharing this special day with us.</i>

22:18.319 --> 22:20.961
<i>As we all know,
life can get pretty tough sometimes.</i>

22:20.986 --> 22:24.297
<i>When the good moments happen,
moments like today,</i>

22:24.322 --> 22:26.485
<i>we've got to mark them
as such and embrace them,</i>

22:26.510 --> 22:30.336
<i>because it's important to
celebrate the milestones.</i>

22:30.361 --> 22:31.844
<i>The job of any parent</i>

22:31.869 --> 22:34.381
<i>is to prepare their kid for the world,</i>

22:34.406 --> 22:36.618
<i>and in David's case,</i>

22:36.731 --> 22:39.145
<i>his mother deserves all the credit.</i>

22:39.170 --> 22:40.981
<i>Let's hear it for Maggie.</i>

22:42.713 --> 22:45.660
<i>I do have a few pieces
of parental advice</i>

22:45.685 --> 22:46.877
<i>that I've learned over the years,</i>

22:46.901 --> 22:51.430
<i>that I'd like to impart to our
son and his beautiful bride.</i>

22:51.455 --> 22:53.829
<i>Number one, if, as a parent...</i>

22:53.854 --> 22:56.446
<i>you have no idea what to do...</i>

22:56.471 --> 22:58.031
- Dad?
- <i>Just choose love.</i>

22:58.079 --> 22:59.678
What's wrong?

23:01.392 --> 23:03.508
It's all right. It's all right.

23:03.731 --> 23:06.806
I'm here. It's okay.

23:06.831 --> 23:08.915
You're okay. I'm here.

23:18.745 --> 23:20.190
Freeze.

23:23.174 --> 23:27.660
Holy blessed father full of grace and...

23:27.685 --> 23:28.805
I appreciate the thoroughness,

23:28.829 --> 23:31.422
but, uh, Pastor Steve will suffice.

23:32.219 --> 23:34.446
- Weren't you at the church last night?
- Yeah.

23:34.471 --> 23:37.005
I'm Zoey...

23:38.550 --> 23:39.797
Mo's neighbor.

23:39.822 --> 23:42.934
Oh. I'm glad I ran into you.

23:42.959 --> 23:44.494
No one's heard from
Mo since he walked out

23:44.518 --> 23:45.922
of the middle of choir practice.

23:45.947 --> 23:47.321
- He did?
- Yeah.

23:47.346 --> 23:49.094
Called, text, no answer.

23:49.119 --> 23:50.399
Thought about sending a dove,

23:50.424 --> 23:53.501
but stopping by with a note
seemed like a better idea.

23:53.526 --> 23:57.339
I wish I could be more help,
but Mo is avoiding me, too.

23:57.364 --> 23:58.975
Any idea what's going on?

23:59.325 --> 24:01.208
I don't want to...

24:01.233 --> 24:04.571
break Mo's trust,
and I don't know how...

24:04.596 --> 24:05.954
I know he's gender fluid.

24:05.979 --> 24:08.251
- You do?
- Yeah. Mo's out to me.

24:08.593 --> 24:10.361
Before joining the choir,
he wanted to make sure

24:10.385 --> 24:14.086
I was an open-minded minister.
I assured him I was.

24:14.111 --> 24:17.735
Oh. I didn't know churches
were okay with that.

24:17.760 --> 24:20.001
Some are. I want mine to be.

24:20.026 --> 24:21.657
Then, why do you think
he's uncomfortable

24:21.682 --> 24:22.930
being himself there?

24:22.955 --> 24:24.288
I couldn't tell you.

24:25.393 --> 24:27.774
Could you make sure he gets this?

24:27.799 --> 24:30.144
And please remind him that sick children

24:30.169 --> 24:31.860
are counting on him to sing this Sunday.

24:31.885 --> 24:33.383
Sure.

24:35.729 --> 24:37.938
But I can't promise it'll do any good.

24:37.963 --> 24:39.813
Oh? You never know.

24:39.838 --> 24:42.571
And if not, maybe we'll ask Him

24:42.596 --> 24:44.579
for a little extra help on this one.

24:54.680 --> 24:56.524
Mo!

24:58.556 --> 25:01.179
Mo, it's me. We really need to talk.

25:04.625 --> 25:06.640
My stove blew up.

25:06.665 --> 25:08.500
I'm on fire!

25:10.721 --> 25:12.843
Okay, now you're just being rude.

25:20.703 --> 25:23.164
Hey. Perfect timing.

25:23.189 --> 25:24.844
Can you help me with
that corner over there?

25:24.868 --> 25:27.080
- Yeah.
- What's wrong?

25:27.105 --> 25:28.656
I just got off the phone with my mom.

25:28.681 --> 25:31.476
Uh, my dad still has not stopped crying.

25:31.501 --> 25:33.262
It's been over a day.

25:33.287 --> 25:35.296
All because you showed
him our wedding video?

25:35.321 --> 25:36.843
My mom spoke to Dr. Hamara,

25:36.868 --> 25:38.713
and he said that uncontrollable emotion

25:38.738 --> 25:40.769
can be a symptom of the disease.

25:40.794 --> 25:42.742
Then, it's not totally your fault.

25:42.767 --> 25:44.257
Can we maybe work on your pep talks

25:44.282 --> 25:45.679
before our baby arrives?

25:45.704 --> 25:49.562
Mm, we can try, but as per our deal,

25:49.587 --> 25:51.390
you can rub my feet now.

25:51.415 --> 25:53.234
Oh, that great deal I made, yeah.

25:53.259 --> 25:54.359
Yeah.

25:54.987 --> 25:57.795
Hey, you gotta stop blaming yourself.

25:57.820 --> 25:59.022
You only had good intentions.

25:59.046 --> 26:00.672
It was still so stupid of me.
I mean, of course

26:00.696 --> 26:02.219
showing him that video
is just gonna remind him

26:02.243 --> 26:04.445
of all the things he's
gonna miss in the future,

26:04.470 --> 26:06.921
all the bigger moments,
all the bigger memories.

26:06.946 --> 26:08.423
Our kid's birthdays.

26:08.448 --> 26:10.059
Our kid's birth.

26:10.084 --> 26:11.594
I mean,

26:11.619 --> 26:15.258
he might not ever meet his grandkid.

26:16.156 --> 26:18.571
Hey, I have an idea.

26:18.596 --> 26:21.321
And I'm not just bringing it
up because it means I win,

26:21.346 --> 26:23.344
although that is a nice added bonus.

26:24.805 --> 26:27.180
Hey, Bonz, it's me.

26:27.205 --> 26:28.804
Just checking in.

26:30.658 --> 26:35.297
I took the liberty of pricing
airfare to Aruba, Jamaica,

26:35.322 --> 26:36.966
some other tropical destinations,

26:36.991 --> 26:40.376
and then I realized you
probably wouldn't go,

26:40.401 --> 26:41.779
even if I bought you a ticket.

26:41.804 --> 26:45.806
But... I got another idea.

26:47.563 --> 26:51.141
When I was little,
all I wanted was to go to outer space.

26:51.166 --> 26:52.547
My parents bought me a telescope,

26:52.572 --> 26:55.607
and I spent hours staring up at the sky.

26:58.637 --> 27:02.951
I got an even better one now,
so what do you say...

27:03.107 --> 27:05.790
you and I take this
bad boy up to the roof?

27:05.815 --> 27:11.585
We can look at the beach,
the bay, the stars.

27:12.982 --> 27:15.093
I feel like it might
be a good first step

27:15.118 --> 27:17.463
towards getting you to Bermuda or Bahama

27:17.488 --> 27:20.056
or wherever you want to go, pretty mama.

27:20.654 --> 27:22.131
Hi.

27:22.156 --> 27:24.165
Are you lying in wait for me now?

27:24.190 --> 27:26.852
Uh, no, but that would have
been super smart on my part.

27:27.338 --> 27:29.422
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, I got a message for you

27:29.447 --> 27:31.883
from Pastor Steve and
a bunch of sick kids.

27:35.802 --> 27:37.204
What does it say?

27:37.229 --> 27:39.587
That I'll always have his support

27:39.612 --> 27:43.329
and he'll be there for me
whenever I decide to come back.

27:43.368 --> 27:45.732
All I wanted was to help.

27:45.757 --> 27:48.236
I didn't mean to ruin church for you.

27:48.261 --> 27:49.305
I know.

27:49.330 --> 27:51.624
I think when you crashed that rehearsal,

27:51.649 --> 27:54.758
I got scared because my
worlds were colliding,

27:54.783 --> 27:58.262
and it made me think of how
big of a hypocrite I'm being.

27:58.420 --> 28:01.643
But clearly it's something
you've been feeling for a while,

28:01.668 --> 28:05.315
because you sang that song to
me before I followed you there.

28:05.339 --> 28:06.900
Because I shouldn't be living two lives.

28:06.924 --> 28:09.032
I mean, how am I supposed to go up there

28:09.057 --> 28:11.688
and sing proudly in front
of God and the congregation

28:11.713 --> 28:12.991
knowing that I'm lying?

28:13.016 --> 28:14.291
What kind of an example does that set

28:14.315 --> 28:15.962
for those kids coming
to service tomorrow?

28:15.987 --> 28:19.212
Well, then, show up
in your sparkliest dress

28:19.237 --> 28:23.417
and "fear not," Isaiah 43:1.

28:23.797 --> 28:25.824
I've been doing my research.

28:28.877 --> 28:31.680
- F-sharp.
- Hmm?

28:31.705 --> 28:33.742
That's the note you're
making with your spoon.

28:33.767 --> 28:35.657
I have perfect pitch.

28:35.682 --> 28:37.063
The church organist discovered it

28:37.088 --> 28:38.883
when I was in the second grade.

28:38.908 --> 28:41.438
Until then, the only other person

28:41.463 --> 28:44.047
that made this little
black boy who liked

28:44.072 --> 28:47.516
clomping around in heels
feel special was my mom.

28:47.541 --> 28:51.102
But when I found out that I
had something special in me

28:51.127 --> 28:54.834
that made people clap rather
than call me a sissy...

28:57.687 --> 28:59.954
I knew I was special, too.

29:01.558 --> 29:03.803
I mean, two weeks in the kids' choir,

29:03.828 --> 29:07.352
and they moved me directly up
to the adult soprano section.

29:07.377 --> 29:08.415
As they should have.

29:08.440 --> 29:11.727
Well, let's say that
I wasn't exactly accepted

29:11.752 --> 29:13.836
by some of those pitchy sisters.

29:13.861 --> 29:17.415
Not because I sang better
than them, which I do.

29:18.873 --> 29:21.516
They said I wasn't right with God.

29:22.324 --> 29:24.546
And they complained
to the choir director,

29:24.571 --> 29:26.883
who didn't care.

29:26.908 --> 29:30.974
And things got so bad that we
just moved to another church,

29:30.999 --> 29:32.743
and then it happened all over again.

29:32.768 --> 29:36.664
So from then on, I vowed to present male

29:36.689 --> 29:39.312
any time that I was
in a house of worship.

29:39.631 --> 29:40.961
But...

29:42.321 --> 29:43.798
isn't it different this time?

29:43.823 --> 29:45.765
Pastor Steve seems so accepting.

29:45.790 --> 29:49.695
He is, but that's no guarantee

29:49.720 --> 29:52.087
that anybody else in
those pews are gonna be.

29:52.112 --> 29:54.734
So my only two options

29:54.759 --> 29:58.656
are to dress like a man
and feel like a fraud

29:59.833 --> 30:01.343
or dress like a female

30:01.368 --> 30:04.640
and risk being run out of the sanctuary.

30:06.007 --> 30:10.906
Mo, I-I wish I knew how to
help you make the decision.

30:11.280 --> 30:16.453
Thanks, but it's gonna take
a miracle to show me the way.

30:17.349 --> 30:20.765
Until then, I'm staying home on Sundays.

30:29.836 --> 30:31.023
Hi.

30:31.179 --> 30:32.461
Hey. What you doing here?

30:32.486 --> 30:35.054
I went by the church,
but the receptionist said

30:35.079 --> 30:36.453
this is where you work on your sermons.

30:36.477 --> 30:39.322
Oh, yeah. I like trying new
material out on the tipsy.

30:39.346 --> 30:40.670
They laugh at my jokes.

30:40.695 --> 30:42.626
They cry at the poignant stuff.

30:42.650 --> 30:45.125
Also like taking the drunks in darts.

30:45.757 --> 30:48.156
For the, uh, Sunday offering, of course.

30:48.812 --> 30:50.654
Want to buy in? 20 bucks.

30:50.679 --> 30:52.086
Sure.

30:56.507 --> 30:58.554
I spoke to Mo.

30:58.931 --> 31:02.944
Um, he says he feels like a...

31:03.195 --> 31:06.257
hypocrite dressing male at church,

31:06.282 --> 31:09.194
but if he shows up the way
he feels most comfortable,

31:09.678 --> 31:13.991
he's afraid the other
members might reject him.

31:14.016 --> 31:15.215
Hmm.

31:16.429 --> 31:17.961
Well, I wish I could guarantee

31:17.986 --> 31:21.163
that everyone in my flock
had open hearts and minds.

31:21.188 --> 31:24.031
Unfortunately humans aren't perfect.

31:24.875 --> 31:27.337
Yep, if they were, I'd be out of a job.

31:29.363 --> 31:30.941
Done all we can.

31:31.211 --> 31:32.943
It's up to Mo now.

31:34.015 --> 31:36.512
Let's hope that he eventually
takes the leap of faith.

31:37.404 --> 31:40.514
Yeah, see,
that whole leap of faith thing

31:40.539 --> 31:42.919
- really doesn't work for me.
- What do you mean?

31:42.943 --> 31:45.484
What if sitting and
waiting isn't an option?

31:45.913 --> 31:51.228
Wh-What if the universe
has made it very clear

31:51.252 --> 31:53.752
that I have to act now
in order to help someone?

31:55.304 --> 31:57.200
Universe is talking to you?

31:57.961 --> 32:00.397
- More like singing.
- Hmm.

32:00.422 --> 32:02.678
And it's making me super sensitive

32:02.703 --> 32:04.908
to other people's thoughts and feelings.

32:05.867 --> 32:08.195
Empathy is a wonderful gift to have.

32:10.976 --> 32:12.397
You're very easy to talk to.

32:12.422 --> 32:14.975
I think I'm starting to get
the whole confession thing.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.602
It's the friendly smile

32:16.626 --> 32:19.171
and the clerical collar.
Gets 'em every time.

32:19.195 --> 32:20.906
The thing is,
I've been trying to do good

32:20.930 --> 32:22.942
and help other people,

32:22.966 --> 32:26.011
but it just feels like
I'm making things worse.

32:26.035 --> 32:28.080
I, uh, drove Mo away from the church.

32:28.104 --> 32:31.183
I intervened in my boss's marriage,

32:31.207 --> 32:33.452
and now she's miserable,

32:33.476 --> 32:36.055
and the verdict's still out
on my downstairs neighbor.

32:36.079 --> 32:38.842
You want assurances that
you're actually helping

32:38.867 --> 32:40.928
whenever you do something for someone?

32:40.953 --> 32:42.453
Yes.

32:42.819 --> 32:44.897
If you're only motivated by proof,

32:44.921 --> 32:48.067
keep your eyes open,
'cause you might just see a miracle.

32:48.091 --> 32:49.869
I'm not talking about giant-sized ones

32:49.893 --> 32:53.906
like parting the Red Sea,
but little ones,

32:53.930 --> 32:57.064
the signposts that
you're on the right path.

33:05.575 --> 33:07.364
Whoo!

33:08.011 --> 33:09.828
You mean like that?

33:10.757 --> 33:12.138
Ooh.

33:12.163 --> 33:15.328
Well, pleasure doing business with you.

33:20.924 --> 33:23.125
- Surprise.
- Hi.

33:23.150 --> 33:27.497
The bubbly was a thank-you
from Simon and Jessica.

33:27.697 --> 33:29.074
Since you introduced us,

33:29.098 --> 33:31.078
I figured I should share the wealth.

33:31.611 --> 33:33.976
Well, thank you.

33:34.003 --> 33:35.781
Cheers to us.

33:35.805 --> 33:37.414
Yeah, to us.

33:43.664 --> 33:45.186
Did I ever tell you about the time

33:45.211 --> 33:47.289
I worked in a winery in France?

33:47.314 --> 33:49.824
- What?
- I had just had this steamy affair

33:49.849 --> 33:52.131
with my married Russian Lit professor,

33:52.155 --> 33:54.168
and I needed to get away from it all.

33:54.193 --> 33:55.388
I'm sorry.

33:55.413 --> 33:59.426
You lived where, when,
and were sleeping with whom?

34:04.117 --> 34:06.568
It's pretty late. Is everything okay?

34:06.593 --> 34:09.793
Uh, yeah. Um, it's Simon.

34:10.726 --> 34:14.429
We have this dumb
back-and-forth running joke.

34:14.454 --> 34:16.203
I may be slow on the uptake here,

34:16.228 --> 34:18.367
but is Simon the guy at the office

34:18.391 --> 34:20.406
that you told me you have a crush on?

34:20.431 --> 34:23.243
That was before we
really knew each other

34:23.268 --> 34:25.617
and before I knew he was engaged.

34:25.641 --> 34:28.351
So now we mostly just
bond about dad stuff.

34:28.376 --> 34:31.998
I bonded with Ray,
my Russian Lit teacher,

34:32.024 --> 34:33.867
over Tolstoy,

34:33.898 --> 34:37.063
and eventually the innocent trading

34:37.089 --> 34:41.264
of favorite "Anna Karenina"
passages turned to more.

34:41.290 --> 34:46.335
And I was devastated when
he told me that he was

34:46.360 --> 34:49.867
not going to leave his wife
and that it had to stop.

34:51.755 --> 34:54.703
You're telling me this why?

34:54.728 --> 34:57.288
I don't ever want you
to hurt the way I did.

34:57.313 --> 35:00.054
Simon and I are friends.

35:00.079 --> 35:01.468
We're not having an affair.

35:01.493 --> 35:04.132
Okay, but I'm not judging you, Zoey.

35:04.157 --> 35:05.760
I'm really not.

35:08.170 --> 35:12.439
Please tell me you have some
salty snacks in your pantry.

35:16.929 --> 35:19.382
_

35:23.056 --> 35:26.617
Simon is the only person
who isn't you and David

35:26.642 --> 35:29.195
who I can talk to about what
I'm going through with Dad.

35:29.220 --> 35:34.068
No one else understands,
and I guess I'm worried

35:34.093 --> 35:40.163
that if I let it go,
let him go, that I...

35:44.258 --> 35:46.469
won't ever feel this way again.

35:46.494 --> 35:48.839
I felt the same way about Ray.

35:48.864 --> 35:50.631
Then I met your dad.

35:51.419 --> 35:53.330
I have faith.

35:53.355 --> 35:54.992
You should, too.

36:05.112 --> 36:08.406
I know it's tempting, but no peeking.

36:11.946 --> 36:14.484
Okay, you can look.

36:22.843 --> 36:24.254
Hey, Dad.

36:24.279 --> 36:26.117
I know you love a live band.

36:26.142 --> 36:28.304
You always taught me to celebrate

36:28.329 --> 36:31.675
the milestones in life, and, uh, this...

36:31.700 --> 36:33.460
This feels like a pretty big one.

36:33.855 --> 36:36.304
And even though I thought
it was a great idea

36:36.329 --> 36:38.296
to wait until the baby was born,

36:38.980 --> 36:42.560
we decided we could
create a bigger moment

36:42.585 --> 36:45.130
and a bigger memory right now.

36:45.670 --> 36:47.663
So let's get this show on the road.

36:55.686 --> 36:57.929
Ahh! Oh, it's a boy.
Is that what that means?

36:57.954 --> 36:59.695
Blue still means boy?

37:01.616 --> 37:03.999
Oh, no, no, no, no.

37:04.024 --> 37:05.757
This was supposed to stop your crying.

37:05.782 --> 37:09.546
It's fine. I think this time,
these are happy tears.

37:10.923 --> 37:12.358
Great job, D.

37:12.383 --> 37:14.016
Thanks, Z.

37:15.047 --> 37:16.958
So, uh...

37:17.177 --> 37:18.633
now that we know
you're gonna have a boy,

37:18.657 --> 37:20.218
you're not gonna need
both of those cakes, are you?

37:20.242 --> 37:22.725
Oh, you... you want
to take the pink one?

37:23.012 --> 37:26.233
I do, but just know it's
for a very good cause.

37:27.438 --> 37:29.530
Tomford, Hermès, come here.

37:29.555 --> 37:31.522
Who is it? Let's see who's there.

37:31.547 --> 37:33.525
Oh, what do we have here?

37:33.550 --> 37:34.849
Ah.

37:37.698 --> 37:40.405
_

37:43.705 --> 37:45.530
Hey, back in the house.

37:50.937 --> 37:52.482
Bonnie?

37:56.671 --> 37:58.342
Hi.

38:01.787 --> 38:03.365
- I'm...
- Zoey.

38:03.390 --> 38:05.424
I recognize your tiny footsteps.

38:05.912 --> 38:08.772
So, I've been thinking about your offer,

38:08.797 --> 38:10.809
the whole telescope-on-the-roof thing.

38:11.365 --> 38:13.256
Seems like it could
be a great first step

38:13.281 --> 38:15.498
toward getting me to the Caribbean.

38:15.712 --> 38:18.928
- Let's do it.
- Except I'm afraid of heights.

38:20.326 --> 38:21.503
How 'bout you just...

38:21.528 --> 38:23.306
come for a quick walk with me?

38:23.331 --> 38:26.377
I want to put my rent
check in Mo's mailbox.

38:26.611 --> 38:28.043
Glad to.

38:32.317 --> 38:35.850
Would you be up for a
slightly longer pilgrimage?

38:36.390 --> 38:37.647
Go away, Zoey,

38:37.672 --> 38:38.811
I'm not in the mood.

38:40.224 --> 38:41.592
What?

38:41.617 --> 38:43.061
Sorry to disturb you,

38:43.086 --> 38:45.732
but there is a tenant from downstairs

38:45.757 --> 38:47.459
that would like to say hi.

38:51.759 --> 38:53.279
Hello, Mo.

38:54.363 --> 38:55.920
Bonnie?

38:56.844 --> 38:59.779
It's so nice to see you.

39:06.843 --> 39:11.717
Okay. That's enough gaping
at the shut-in for one day.

39:12.244 --> 39:14.607
Maybe we can do this again tomorrow?

39:26.481 --> 39:28.174
How'd you do that?

39:28.199 --> 39:29.631
It was all her.

39:29.656 --> 39:33.102
I guess she just took a leap of faith.

39:33.671 --> 39:36.725
I mean, I'm sitting here,
and I'm feeling awful for myself.

39:36.750 --> 39:38.594
Then that just happened.
That's incredible.

39:38.619 --> 39:40.201
Well, let's not take it that far.

39:40.226 --> 39:42.764
I mean, she only, like,
walked up a flight of stairs.

39:42.789 --> 39:45.101
You're not getting it.
I said the only thing

39:45.126 --> 39:46.928
to make me go back
to church was a miracle.

39:46.953 --> 39:48.342
That was a miracle.

39:48.367 --> 39:51.139
I mean, if Bonnie has enough courage

39:51.164 --> 39:53.576
to face her fears, so can I.

39:54.061 --> 39:56.248
A signpost.

39:58.300 --> 40:00.092
So what happens now?

40:00.117 --> 40:03.373
I'm a man of my word, which means
I have exactly 20 minutes

40:03.398 --> 40:05.565
to pick a wig and paint my face.

40:07.003 --> 40:08.347
Good morning.

40:08.372 --> 40:10.147
Good morning.

40:11.004 --> 40:16.720
On this beautiful Sunday,
music shall provide the message.

40:16.893 --> 40:18.637
It's simple.

40:18.662 --> 40:20.974
All of us are welcome.

40:21.239 --> 40:24.240
All of us are loved.
