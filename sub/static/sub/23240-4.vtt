00:03.900 --> 00:06.067
Jazz: PREVIOUSLY ON
"I AM JAZZ"...

00:06.067 --> 00:07.500
YOU READY?

00:07.500 --> 00:09.933
Jeanette: JAZZ AND I HAVE BEEN
INVITED TO BE ON A PODCAST.

00:09.933 --> 00:11.700
HAD I BROUGHT
LITTLE JAZZ TO YOU,

00:11.700 --> 00:13.567
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
TOLD ME AS A PARENT?

00:13.567 --> 00:16.400
Dr. Bradley: If anything, it
would be gentle discouragement.

00:16.400 --> 00:18.433
IF I HAD TO GO THROUGH
MALE PUBERTY,

00:18.433 --> 00:20.700
THAT'S COMPARABLE
TO A FORM OF TORTURE.

00:20.700 --> 00:24.533
I HAVE TO LOSE 30 POUNDS
BEFORE I CAN GET THE SURGERY.

00:24.533 --> 00:26.800
HEY, AT LEAST SOMETHING'S
GONNA MOTIVATE YOU.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.533
I KNEW THAT MY WEIGHT
WAS A PROBLEM,

00:28.533 --> 00:31.667
BUT I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT
IT COULD AFFECT SOMETHING

00:31.667 --> 00:33.433
THAT I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR MY ENTIRE LIFE.

00:33.433 --> 00:34.900
-YES.

00:34.900 --> 00:36.700
AND YOU GUYS GOT TO HELP ME.
-IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY,

00:36.700 --> 00:38.333
JUST LIKE THE SURGERY'S
NOT GONNA BE EASY.

00:38.333 --> 00:41.533
WE HAVEN'T HAD A LOT OF KIDS WHO
HAVE HAD THEIR PUBERTY BLOCKED.

00:41.533 --> 00:43.633
WE WANT TO GET AS MUCH SKIN
FROM EVERYWHERE.

00:43.633 --> 00:46.367
A TISSUE EXPANDER IS
AN IMPLANTABLE DEVICE

00:46.367 --> 00:48.600
TO GRADUALLY
STRETCH THE SKIN.

00:48.600 --> 00:52.500
I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD IF YOU
VISITED DR. TING AT MOUNT SINAI.

00:52.500 --> 00:56.600
Greg:
THE IDEA OF GOING TO NEW YORK
AND HAVING ANOTHER CONSULTATION

00:56.600 --> 00:58.467
JUST OPENS UP
A CAN OF WORMS.

00:58.467 --> 00:59.667
WE ARE OVERWHELMED.

00:59.667 --> 01:03.267
LIKE, SHE HIT US OVER
THE HEAD WITH A BRICK.

01:03.267 --> 01:06.333
Jazz: 16 YEARS AGO,
I WAS ASSIGNED MALE AT BIRTH,

01:06.333 --> 01:08.700
BUT INSIDE,
I ALWAYS KNEW I WAS A GIRL.

01:08.700 --> 01:11.133
I HAVE A GIRL BRAIN
AND A BOY BODY.

01:11.133 --> 01:13.633
BEING TRANSGENDER
HASN'T BEEN EASY.

01:13.633 --> 01:15.767
WE REALLY ARE WALKING
A TIGHTROPE.

01:15.767 --> 01:17.733
-I'M A TOUGH CASE.
-YOU'RE A TOUGH CASE.

01:17.733 --> 01:19.233
COME ON, JAZZ!
WHOO!

01:19.233 --> 01:21.667
GO FOR IT, GIRL!

01:21.667 --> 01:23.833
BUT IT'S MADE ME WHO I AM.

01:23.833 --> 01:25.700
I AM JAZZ.

CAPTIONS PAID FOR BY
DISCOVERY COMMUNICATIONS

01:34.067 --> 01:35.333
Griffen: ALL RIGHT,
I WANT TO SEE YOU DO 25. READY?

01:35.333 --> 01:38.967
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

01:38.967 --> 01:41.800
IF YOU DON'T GET 25
IN A ROW, RESTART.

01:41.800 --> 01:43.467
YOU READY?
WANT TO START DOWN HERE.

01:43.467 --> 01:45.767
JUST DO A FULL CURL.

01:45.767 --> 01:46.967
Jazz: I SUCK AT THIS.

01:46.967 --> 01:48.100
FEELS GOOD THOUGH,
RIGHT?

01:48.100 --> 01:50.133
YEAH.
DO 10.

01:50.133 --> 01:52.900
I HAVE DEFINITELY TRIED
TO LOSE WEIGHT BEFORE.

01:52.900 --> 01:54.233
LAST ONE.

01:54.233 --> 01:57.133
I FIRST STARTED DIETING
WHEN I WAS IN FIFTH GRADE...

01:57.133 --> 01:58.900
OKAY.
I'M DONE WITH THOSE.

01:58.900 --> 02:00.400
DAMN.

02:00.400 --> 02:03.267
...AND IT'S JUST BEEN
A CONSTANT BATTLE SINCE THEN.

02:03.267 --> 02:04.467
YOU'RE GONNA DO TWO SETS.

02:04.467 --> 02:06.267
OF SQUATS? I DON'T WANT TO
DO SQUATS ANYMORE.

02:06.267 --> 02:08.300
THIS IS NOT YOUR WORKOUT.
I'M RUNNING THE WORKOUT.

02:08.300 --> 02:09.733
HEY.

02:09.733 --> 02:12.733
TOUGH LOVE IS WHAT MOTIVATES
CHANGE IN SOMEONE'S LIFE.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.133
DO THIS.

02:14.133 --> 02:15.167
YEP.

02:15.167 --> 02:16.500
I FEEL LIKE ONE
OF THOSE MONKEYS.

02:16.500 --> 02:18.333
JAZZ HAS ALWAYS WANTED
THIS SURGERY,

02:18.333 --> 02:20.067
AND IT'S KIND OF SCARY
THAT HER WEIGHT

02:20.067 --> 02:22.233
COULD BE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
IF SHE CAN GET IT OR NOT.

02:22.233 --> 02:24.533
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN ONE OF
THE BEST ATHLETES AROUND.

02:24.533 --> 02:26.800
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED AND
WHY YOU GAINED SO MUCH WEIGHT.

02:26.800 --> 02:28.467
OH, YOU'RE SWEET.

02:28.467 --> 02:30.300
I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING
YOU DON'T KNOW.

02:30.300 --> 02:31.700
I KNOW.

02:31.700 --> 02:33.100
Jazz: I DON'T LIKE IT WHEN
MY BROTHERS ARE TELLING ME

02:33.100 --> 02:35.900
THAT I HAVE TO LOSE WEIGHT, EVEN
IF I DO HAVE TO LOSE WEIGHT.

02:35.900 --> 02:37.533
KIND OF LOWERS MY SELF-ESTEEM

02:37.533 --> 02:39.833
AND MAKES ME FEEL
WORSE ABOUT MYSELF.

02:39.833 --> 02:41.200
YOU'RE GONNA LOSE IT
THOUGH, RIGHT?

02:41.200 --> 02:43.667
HAVE YOU BEEN STARTING?
HAVE YOU BEEN MAKING PROGRESS?

02:43.667 --> 02:46.167
YEAH. I'VE BEEN WORKING OUT
AND EATING HEALTHY.

02:46.167 --> 02:48.267
I DON'T THINK MY BROTHERS
FULLY UNDERSTAND

02:48.267 --> 02:50.267
WHY I'M STRUGGLING
WITH MY WEIGHT.

02:50.267 --> 02:53.067
THEY'VE NEVER HAD TO DEAL
WITH ANXIETY OR DEPRESSION,

02:53.067 --> 02:55.067
SO THEY DON'T KNOW
HOW THAT AFFECTS

02:55.067 --> 02:56.500
MY UNHEALTHY EATING HABITS,

02:56.500 --> 02:58.067
ESPECIALLY BINGE EATING.

02:58.067 --> 02:59.600
Griffen: OBVIOUSLY, THE MOST
MOTIVATING FACTOR IN THIS

02:59.600 --> 03:02.100
IS BECAUSE MARCI BOWERS TOLD YOU
YOU NEED TO LOSE WEIGHT,

03:02.100 --> 03:04.767
BUT DOES SOCCER MOTIVATE YOU
AT ALL OR NOT ANYMORE?

03:04.767 --> 03:05.967
'CAUSE I KNOW YOU USED
TO LOVE SOCCER.

03:05.967 --> 03:08.233
NOT REALLY.
THAT'S NOT A FACTOR.

03:08.233 --> 03:10.200
SO IS YOUR COMPETITIVE NATURE
JUST GONE?

03:10.200 --> 03:11.867
I'M NOT VERY COMPETITIVE.
NO. NOT AT ALL.

03:11.867 --> 03:14.067
YOU JUST DON'T LIKE WINNING?
IT'S ALSO COMPETITIVE.

03:14.067 --> 03:15.433
SOCCER JUST ISN'T ONE
OF MY PERSONAL GOALS.

03:15.433 --> 03:17.933
Griffen: IN HER PRIME, I'D SAY
JAZZ HAD THE MOST POTENTIAL

03:17.933 --> 03:19.867
OUT OF ANY OF US
AS AN ATHLETE.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.600
Woman: GOOD. GO.
EXPLODE.

03:21.600 --> 03:24.500
WOW.

03:24.500 --> 03:27.733
SHE WAS SO FAST, SO GOOD,
AND, HONESTLY, SO MUCH BETTER

03:27.733 --> 03:29.900
THAN ALMOST ANYBODY
SHE FACED.

03:29.900 --> 03:32.367
WHEN I SEE THAT YOU'RE
20 POUNDS MORE THAN ME,

03:32.367 --> 03:34.467
30 POUNDS MORE THAN ME,

03:34.467 --> 03:36.067
I'M NOT SO HAPPY ABOUT THAT

03:36.067 --> 03:38.400
'CAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE
BETTER THAN THAT, YOU KNOW?

03:38.400 --> 03:40.067
I KNOW YOU'RE ABLE
TO LOSE WEIGHT,

03:40.067 --> 03:41.633
BUT YOU HAVE TO WANT TO BE,
WHICH IS WHY I'M TRYING TO FIND

03:41.633 --> 03:42.900
DIFFERENT MOTIVATING
FACTORS FOR YOU,

03:42.900 --> 03:44.600
WHICH IS WHY I THINK
SOCCER IS A GREAT ONE

03:44.600 --> 03:46.400
'CAUSE I KNOW YOU USED
TO LOVE THE SPORT.

03:46.400 --> 03:47.833
WE'RE ONLY GIVING
JAZZ TOUGH LOVE

03:47.833 --> 03:49.367
BECAUSE WE WANT
TO SEE HER CHANGE.

03:49.367 --> 03:50.433
WE WANT TO SEE HER LOSE WEIGHT

03:50.433 --> 03:52.633
BECAUSE WE KNOW
IT'S FOR THE BEST.

03:52.633 --> 03:54.500
SO THANK YOU
FOR YOUR MOTIVATION.

03:54.500 --> 03:56.067
I JUST --
YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD FOR ME

03:56.067 --> 03:58.300
'CAUSE I'M STILL GONNA
ALWAYS BE THAT GIRL

03:58.300 --> 04:00.167
WHO LOVES EATING FOOD.

04:00.167 --> 04:02.933
I'M JUST TELLING HER THAT SHE
NEEDS TO GO SIT IN THE CORNER

04:02.933 --> 04:05.233
FOR A LITTLE BIT
OR FOREVER.

04:05.233 --> 04:07.433
WHO
I LOST IT.

04:07.433 --> 04:08.633
THE GIRL WHO LOVES
EATING FOOD.

04:08.633 --> 04:10.600
OH, MY GOD.
WERE YOU NOT LISTENING?

04:10.600 --> 04:13.433
OH. THAT DIDN'T REALLY
MAKE SENSE TO ME.

04:13.433 --> 04:14.833
LET'S DO
SOME SHOULDER STUFF.

04:14.833 --> 04:17.933
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S START REALLY SLOW.

04:17.933 --> 04:26.733
**

04:26.733 --> 04:27.933
Noelle:
I'LL GET THE STRAWBERRY.

04:27.933 --> 04:29.100
Jazz: I'M GONNA GET
THAT ONE AS WELL.

04:29.100 --> 04:30.400
Man: SURE.
JUST GIVE US A FEW MINUTES.

04:30.400 --> 04:31.600
I'LL BRING IT OUT TO YOU,
OKAY?

04:31.600 --> 04:33.067
-THANK YOU.
-SURE.

04:33.067 --> 04:35.400
Jazz: TODAY, I AM GETTING
SMOOTHIES WITH NOELLE,

04:35.400 --> 04:38.067
AND I JUST REALLY NEEDED A BREAK
FROM MY BROTHER'S WORKOUTS

04:38.067 --> 04:39.600
BECAUSE HE'S TOUGH ON ME,

04:39.600 --> 04:41.900
AND I ALSO KNOW
THAT NOELLE IS DYING

04:41.900 --> 04:43.567
TO FIND OUT HOW THE PODCAST WENT

04:43.567 --> 04:45.267
SINCE SHE HELPED ME
PREPARE FOR IT.

04:45.267 --> 04:48.067
AS YOU CAN SEE, EVERYTHING HERE
IS REALLY HEALTHY.

04:48.067 --> 04:49.533
SMELLS HEALTHY, TOO.

04:49.533 --> 04:50.900
I KNOW.

04:50.900 --> 04:53.367
SO, I'M REALLY CURIOUS.

04:53.367 --> 04:54.733
HOW'D YOUR PODCAST GO?

04:54.733 --> 04:56.233
IT ACTUALLY WENT
REALLY WELL.

04:56.233 --> 04:59.067
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF WHAT
DR. BRADLEY WAS SAYING WAS,

04:59.067 --> 05:01.933
HONESTLY, JUST IDIOTIC.

05:01.933 --> 05:05.067
DID OUR LITTLE STUDY SESSION
HELP OUT AT ALL?

05:05.067 --> 05:06.367
YOUR RESEARCH DID HELP.

05:06.367 --> 05:09.533
I FEEL LIKE I WAS ABLE
TO GET OUR POINT ACROSS.

05:09.533 --> 05:11.867
I MEAN, LIKE, I WOULD
HAVE LIKED TO BE THERE.

05:11.867 --> 05:13.067
I KNOW, OBVIOUSLY.

05:13.067 --> 05:14.800
I WAS THINKING THAT
THE WHOLE TIME, LIKE,

05:14.800 --> 05:17.167
"NOELLE WOULD TOTALLY
BE GOOD AT THIS."

05:17.167 --> 05:19.767
I'M GLAD THAT JAZZ PARTICIPATED
ON THIS PODCAST,

05:19.767 --> 05:22.833
JUST BECAUSE THIS RESEARCH
GIVES FALSE JUSTIFICATION

05:22.833 --> 05:24.500
FOR TRANSPHOBIC IDEAS,

05:24.500 --> 05:28.700
AND JAZZ IS A VERY LOUD VOICE
FOR THE TRANS COMMUNITY,

05:28.700 --> 05:31.833
SO IF SHE SAYS SOMETHING,
SHE WILL BE HEARD.

05:31.833 --> 05:33.067
THESE ARE PROBABLY
THE BEST SMOOTHIES

05:33.067 --> 05:35.067
I'VE HAD IN A LONG TIME.
-YEAH.

05:35.067 --> 05:38.967
I'VE BEEN JUST FOCUSING ON
EATING HEALTHY AND LOSING WEIGHT

05:38.967 --> 05:41.067
'CAUSE, OTHERWISE, I'M NOT
GONNA GET THE SURGERY,

05:41.067 --> 05:43.367
AND I NEED TO LOSE
30 POUNDS.

05:43.367 --> 05:44.533
HOW'S THAT GOING FOR YOU?

05:44.533 --> 05:45.933
IT'S KIND OF SCARY
AND INTIMIDATING,

05:45.933 --> 05:48.867
BUT I'M STARTING
WITH SMOOTHIES.

05:48.867 --> 05:50.333
YAY.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.633
I KNOW HOW MENTALLY STRENUOUS
LOSING WEIGHT CAN BE BECAUSE,

05:52.633 --> 05:55.500
SINCE GOING ON ESTROGEN,
I'VE GAINED A LOT OF WEIGHT,

05:55.500 --> 05:57.067
AND I FEAR THAT, YOU KNOW,

05:57.067 --> 05:58.967
MY BMI WILL BE SOMETHING
THAT'S CONCERNING

05:58.967 --> 06:00.900
WHEN IT COMES
TO MY SURGERY.

06:00.900 --> 06:04.867
YOU KNOW, ALSO, I'M GOING TO
NEW YORK AND VISITING DR. TING

06:04.867 --> 06:06.267
FOR ANOTHER CONSULTATION.

06:06.267 --> 06:08.267
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING
DR. TING FOR?

06:08.267 --> 06:10.667
WELL, YOU KNOW THAT I
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TISSUE,

06:10.667 --> 06:13.367
AND WE HAVE TO FIND
A WAY TO INCREASE THAT.

06:13.367 --> 06:15.900
DR. BOWERS PROVIDED
ALL THESE OPTIONS,

06:15.900 --> 06:18.433
AND I'M VISITING DR. TING
TO DETERMINE

06:18.433 --> 06:20.700
IF I CAN GET THIS
PERITONEAL LINING PROCEDURE

06:20.700 --> 06:23.067
BECAUSE
HE SPECIALIZES IN THAT.

06:23.067 --> 06:25.067
Jazz: MARCI BOWERS
DOESN'T DO THIS PROCEDURE

06:25.067 --> 06:28.733
WHERE THEY USE THE LINING AROUND
YOUR STOMACH TO MAKE A VAGINA

06:28.733 --> 06:31.667
BECAUSE HOW EXPERIMENTAL
IT IS AT THIS MOMENT.

06:31.667 --> 06:34.800
THE FACT THAT IT'S SO NEW
KIND OF SCARES ME,

06:34.800 --> 06:37.200
BUT I DO KNOW I'M GONNA
HAVE TO BE A PIONEER

06:37.200 --> 06:39.133
WHEN IT COMES TO MY PROCEDURE

06:39.133 --> 06:41.733
BECAUSE I'M ONE OF THE
FIRST TRANSGENDER YOUTH

06:41.733 --> 06:43.200
WHO'S BEEN COMPLETELY SUPPRESSED

06:43.200 --> 06:44.933
WHO IS GETTING
THIS OPERATION DONE.

06:44.933 --> 06:47.433
HE'S GONNA DETERMINE
IF I'M, LIKE, YOU KNOW,

06:47.433 --> 06:49.067
A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR THAT,

06:49.067 --> 06:51.300
BUT, ALSO,
HE'S GONNA FIGURE OUT

06:51.300 --> 06:54.900
IF I DO NEED A TISSUE EXPANDER
OR NOT.

06:54.900 --> 06:57.300
THIS TISSUE EXPANDER
IS ANOTHER OPTION.

06:57.300 --> 07:00.633
IT'S BASICALLY PUTTING A BALLOON
INSIDE MY GENITALS

07:00.633 --> 07:02.667
SO THAT MY SKIN COULD STRETCH.

07:02.667 --> 07:04.467
THEN I WOULD HAVE ENOUGH TISSUE

07:04.467 --> 07:07.400
TO GET THE REGULAR
STANDARD VAGINOPLASTY,

07:07.400 --> 07:09.500
BUT KNOWING THAT
THAT PART OF MY BODY

07:09.500 --> 07:11.067
IS GONNA BE GROWING MORE,

07:11.067 --> 07:15.167
IT'S LIKE SOMETHING DISGUSTING
AND HORRIFYING IN MY MIND.

07:15.167 --> 07:18.900
THIS TISSUE EXPANDER THING
HAS BEEN ON MY MIND A LOT.

07:18.900 --> 07:21.267
JUST DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
THE BEST OPTION.

07:21.267 --> 07:23.667
IT REALLY SEEMS LIKE
IT'S ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER

07:23.667 --> 07:25.800
WHEN IT COMES TO
GETTING THE SURGERY.

07:25.800 --> 07:29.067
Noelle:
I DON'T KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT
THE DIFFERENT METHODS OF SURGERY

07:29.067 --> 07:31.800
THAT JAZZ'S DOCTORS
ARE OFFERING HER,

07:31.800 --> 07:35.300
BUT I HOPE THAT SHE DOESN'T GO
WITH ANYTHING TOO EXPERIMENTAL,

07:35.300 --> 07:37.900
JUST BECAUSE IT WOULDN'T
BE THE BEST THING

07:37.900 --> 07:39.967
IF THIS EXPERIMENT WENT WRONG.

07:39.967 --> 07:45.333
**

07:45.333 --> 07:50.700
**

07:52.467 --> 07:54.667
LOOK AT THE FLOWERS
THAT DADDY GOT FOR ME.

07:54.667 --> 07:56.067
AREN'T THEY BEAUTIFUL?

07:56.067 --> 07:58.100
-BEAUTIFUL.

07:58.100 --> 08:00.333
I KNOW I'M SUPPOSED
TO CALL MARCI AT 12:00.

08:00.333 --> 08:01.900
IT'S ALMOST 12:00.

08:01.900 --> 08:04.067
Jeanette: WE'RE FACETIMING
WITH DR. BOWERS TODAY

08:04.067 --> 08:06.200
SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE
WE HAVE ALL OUR DUCKS IN A ROW

08:06.200 --> 08:07.800
BEFORE WE SEE DR. TING.

08:07.800 --> 08:09.267
SHE'S JUST BRIEFING US ON IT,

08:09.267 --> 08:11.700
AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON

08:11.700 --> 08:13.433
BEFORE WE HEAD TO NEW YORK.

08:13.433 --> 08:15.333
SO, JAZZ, YOU READY
TO GO TO NEW YORK?

08:15.333 --> 08:16.667
Jazz: I DON'T KNOW.

08:16.667 --> 08:18.167
MY FEAR IS THAT
HE'S GONNA BE LIKE,

08:18.167 --> 08:20.067
"TISSUE EXPANDER,
TISSUE EXPANDER."

08:20.067 --> 08:22.900
HE'LL DECIDE WHAT HE THINKS
AFTER HE EXAMINES YOU.

08:22.900 --> 08:27.733
I FEEL LIKE EVERYONE IN THIS
WORLD HAS EXAMINED ME BY NOW.

08:27.733 --> 08:30.800
Jazz: I HONESTLY THOUGHT THAT
ONCE I CHOSE DR. MARCI BOWERS

08:30.800 --> 08:34.400
AS MY SURGEON THAT I WOULDN'T
HAVE TO VISIT ANY MORE DOCTORS,

08:34.400 --> 08:36.367
SO IT JUST FEELS
LIKE AN EXTRA STEP

08:36.367 --> 08:38.467
TO HAVE TO GO TO NEW YORK
TO SEE DR. TING

08:38.467 --> 08:41.500
AND HEAR HIS PERSPECTIVE ON
THE PERITONEAL LINING PROCEDURE

08:41.500 --> 08:44.167
AND THE TISSUE EXPANDER.

08:44.167 --> 08:45.333
Dr. Bowers: Hi.

08:45.333 --> 08:46.867
HELLO.HELLO.

08:46.867 --> 08:49.067
Well,
how are things going?

08:49.067 --> 08:52.733
GOOD. WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT
ABOUT OUR LAST VISIT WITH YOU

08:52.733 --> 08:54.800
AND DIGESTING EVERYTHING
AND...

08:54.800 --> 08:56.300
How about the diet?

08:56.300 --> 08:58.700
Are you making
progress there?

08:58.700 --> 09:01.700
YEAH, NO. I'VE BEEN WORKING ON
IT QUITE A LOT.

09:01.700 --> 09:03.800
That's terrific.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

09:03.800 --> 09:06.333
How about
the therapy letters?

09:06.333 --> 09:08.067
Have you been working
on those as well?

09:08.067 --> 09:10.800
SHE HAS BEEN WITH ONE DOCTOR
SINCE SHE WAS 3,

09:10.800 --> 09:12.833
SO THAT DOCTOR FOR SURE.

09:12.833 --> 09:16.500
BEFORE JAZZ GETS THE GREEN LIGHT
TO GO FORWARD WITH THE SURGERY,

09:16.500 --> 09:19.600
SHE HAS TO HAVE TWO LETTERS
FROM TWO DIFFERENT THERAPISTS.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.367
DR. VOLKER KNOWS JAZZ

09:21.367 --> 09:23.400
BETTER THAN ANY OTHER
MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELOR,

09:23.400 --> 09:26.567
AND SHE IS THE PERSON THAT NEEDS
TO WRITE LETTER NUMBER ONE,

09:26.567 --> 09:30.100
BUT WE NEED TO FIND A SECOND
THERAPIST FOR THE SECOND LETTER.

09:30.100 --> 09:32.800
WE'RE ACTIVELY LOOKING
FOR SOMEBODY NOW.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.100
Okay.

09:34.100 --> 09:36.767
Have you worked on what
we talked about last time?

09:36.767 --> 09:39.467
UM...

09:39.467 --> 09:41.200
WE REALLY ARE WALKING
A TIGHTROPE.

09:41.200 --> 09:43.600
WE HAVE A SKIN ISSUE.
WE HAVE THE ORGASM ISSUE.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.967
HAVE YOU TRIED
A LITTLE BIT TO GET...

09:45.967 --> 09:47.067
Jazz:
I'VE TRIED, BUT...

09:47.067 --> 09:50.300
...POSITIVE FEELINGS
AND EVEN ORGASM?

09:50.300 --> 09:51.733
THERE'S NOT MUCH
GOING ON.

09:51.733 --> 09:53.433
YEAH.

09:53.433 --> 09:54.667
Dr. Bowers: Hmm.

09:54.667 --> 09:59.067
WHEN DR. BOWERS BRINGS UP
THE WHOLE ORGASM TOPIC,

09:59.067 --> 10:01.167
I KNOW JAZZ GETS UNCOMFORTABLE.

10:01.167 --> 10:02.567
I'M UNCOMFORTABLE.

10:02.567 --> 10:04.233
THIS IS NOT ANY OF
MY BUSINESS, REALLY.

10:04.233 --> 10:06.067
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
A PRIVATE THING.

10:06.067 --> 10:07.567
Dr. Bowers:
That part's important.

10:07.567 --> 10:09.867
You know, if you put your mind
to it, these things can happen.

10:09.867 --> 10:12.200
You need to awaken
those sexual feelings

10:12.200 --> 10:14.967
because if it's not there
before surgery,

10:14.967 --> 10:17.733
it's not likely to be
there after surgery.

10:17.733 --> 10:22.000
Jeanette:
I WANT JAZZ TO HAVE A WONDERFUL
FUTURE WITH A LOVING PARTNER

10:22.000 --> 10:23.867
AND HAVE A VERY
HEALTHY SEX LIFE.

10:23.867 --> 10:29.867
I WANT JAZZ TO LOVE AND BE LOVED
IN THE WAY THAT SHE DESERVES.

10:29.867 --> 10:33.067
Dr. Bowers:
And we mentioned last time
the tissue expander idea.

10:33.067 --> 10:36.267
It's possible he's gonna
recommend that,

10:36.267 --> 10:38.367
so I'm gonna have you
talk to Dr. Ting

10:38.367 --> 10:41.300
about that,
although the problem I saw

10:41.300 --> 10:45.833
was that that isn't really gonna
be very comfortable.

10:45.833 --> 10:46.833
YEAH.

10:46.833 --> 10:48.200
But I have made arrangements.

10:48.200 --> 10:49.367
In case they need to be done,

10:49.367 --> 10:51.200
I've made arrangements
for the O.R.

10:51.200 --> 10:53.867
in case we choose to do it.

10:53.867 --> 10:54.967
WAIT. WHAT?

10:54.967 --> 10:56.667
It's a consideration.

10:56.667 --> 10:59.700
Jazz: I DIDN'T REALIZE I MIGHT
COME HOME FROM NEW YORK

10:59.700 --> 11:02.067
WITH THIS BALLOON
BETWEEN MY LEGS.

11:02.067 --> 11:03.767
THAT'S SUPER SCARY.

11:03.767 --> 11:05.667
THAT'S SOMETHING
TO DIGEST.

11:05.667 --> 11:08.133
HAVING THIS
TISSUE EXPANDER SURGERY

11:08.133 --> 11:10.233
WILL DEFINITELY
DISRUPT MY LIFE,

11:10.233 --> 11:14.067
AND I DON'T THINK
I'M READY FOR THAT.

11:14.067 --> 11:15.867
YOU'VE BEEN ON
A COUPLE OF DATES.

11:15.867 --> 11:19.667
IS THIS A SOUL MATE
OR A SEXUAL MATE?

11:19.667 --> 11:21.867
GRANDMA.

11:21.867 --> 11:24.067
WE'RE ON OUR WAY
TO MEET DR. TING...

11:24.067 --> 11:25.900
-DR. TING.
-...IN NEW YORK.

11:25.900 --> 11:27.933
YOU HAVE TO PUT A NEEDLE
THROUGH THE SKIN

11:27.933 --> 11:29.733
IN THE SCROTUM
INTO THE EXPANDER

11:29.733 --> 11:31.667
AND INJECT SALINE INTO IT.

11:31.667 --> 11:33.467
THIS IS A BIG STEP.

11:37.667 --> 11:45.733
**

11:45.733 --> 11:47.167
I THINK WE SHOULD
EAT NEMO FOR DINNER.

11:47.167 --> 11:48.867
-IF ANYONE EVER ATE HIM...
-OH, MY GOD.

11:48.867 --> 11:51.267
OH, NO.

11:51.267 --> 11:52.567
MOM ASKED ME TO WEAR IT,

11:52.567 --> 11:53.833
SO I'M CHEF SANDER
FOR THE NIGHT.

11:53.833 --> 11:55.733
I'M GONNA COOK IN STYLE.

11:55.733 --> 12:00.067
I'M GONNA WEAR MY CHEF HAT
AND APRON 'CAUSE IT LOOKS GOOD,

12:00.067 --> 12:03.133
AND IF YOU LOOK GOOD, YOU FEEL
GOOD, AND YOU COOK GOOD.

12:03.133 --> 12:08.233
THAT'S ME, CHEF SANDER,
AT YOUR SERVICE.

12:08.233 --> 12:09.867
HERE COMES THE SALAD.

12:09.867 --> 12:11.067
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE?

12:11.067 --> 12:12.933
WHERE'S THE BEEF,
SANDER?

12:12.933 --> 12:17.267
SANDER IS JUST OUT
OF CONTROL WITH THIS...

12:17.267 --> 12:18.567
-IT'S NOT OUT OF --
-...HIS APRON.

12:18.567 --> 12:19.967
HE DOESN'T EVEN PUT
A SHIRT UNDERNEATH.

12:19.967 --> 12:21.233
I KNOW.
IT WAS CUTE.

12:21.233 --> 12:23.267
HARD TO CUT.

12:23.267 --> 12:24.633
IT'S A LITTLE BIT
ON THE RARE SIDE.

12:26.467 --> 12:29.567
I WISH HE COULD COOK
AS GOOD AS HE LOOKED.

12:29.567 --> 12:31.633
HE THINKS HE CAN,
SO DON'T TELL HIM.

12:31.633 --> 12:32.767
IT'S TASTY THOUGH.

12:32.767 --> 12:35.067
I'M SAVING MY CALORIES
FOR VACATION.

12:35.067 --> 12:36.967
ARE WE GONNA BE EATING STEAKS
IN THE GRAND CANYON?

12:36.967 --> 12:39.333
YOU DIDN'T TELL THEM ABOUT
WHAT WAS GOING ON?

12:39.333 --> 12:41.100
NO.
THAT'S YOUR JOB.

12:41.100 --> 12:42.233
OH.

12:42.233 --> 12:43.667
WELL, WE'RE GOING
TO NEW YORK CITY.

12:43.667 --> 12:45.567
WE HAVE TO HAVE
THIS CONSULTATION.

12:45.567 --> 12:50.600
WHAT I WANT TO TRY AND DO IS TO
PIGGYBACK OUR TRIP TO NEW YORK

12:50.600 --> 12:54.500
AND DO A FAMILY
RAFTING EXCURSION.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.367
RAFTING IS FUN NO MATTER
WHERE YOU GO,

12:56.367 --> 12:59.067
AND WE'LL HAVE MANHATTAN
TO GO TO AS WELL.

12:59.067 --> 13:00.767
I WAS TOLD I WAS GOING TO THE
GRAND CANYON WITH MY FAMILY,

13:00.767 --> 13:03.667
AND I WAS SUPER EXCITED,
SO TO HAVE THAT TAKEN AWAY

13:03.667 --> 13:05.833
AND TO BE TOLD THAT NOW
I'M GOING TO NEW YORK,

13:05.833 --> 13:07.067
IT'S NOT REALLY FAIR.

13:07.067 --> 13:08.433
Jazz: WELL, I KIND OF FEEL
LIKE IT'S MY FAULT.

13:08.433 --> 13:10.800
WE'RE NOT GOING TO
THE GRAND CANYON BECAUSE OF ME.

13:10.800 --> 13:12.067
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME

13:12.067 --> 13:13.833
THAT WE'VE HAD TO PLAN
A FAMILY VACATION

13:13.833 --> 13:16.900
BASED ON
MY MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS.

13:16.900 --> 13:20.200
I REALLY KNOW MY BROTHERS WANTED
TO GO TO THE GRAND CANYON,

13:20.200 --> 13:23.333
AND I FEEL BAD THAT
THEY'RE DISAPPOINTED.

13:23.333 --> 13:25.533
WE GET IT. YOU DON'T WANT TO PAY
FOR TWO VACATIONS.

13:25.533 --> 13:26.633
WELL, IT'S NOT THAT.

13:26.633 --> 13:28.067
YOU ONLY HAVE A LIMITED
AMOUNT OF TIME

13:28.067 --> 13:30.200
BEFORE YOU HAVE TO
GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

13:30.200 --> 13:32.067
TAKE IT.
I DON'T DESERVE IT.

13:32.067 --> 13:33.300
SO THE KIDS HAVE TO GO
BACK TO COLLEGE.

13:33.300 --> 13:34.533
WE HAVE LIMITED TIME,

13:34.533 --> 13:38.400
BUT WE NEED TO GET THIS
CONSULTATION DONE, SO...

13:38.400 --> 13:40.867
DR. TING'S OFFICE WAS TOO FAR
FROM THE GRAND CANYON,

13:40.867 --> 13:43.300
WAS THE BOTTOM LINE.

13:43.300 --> 13:46.967
OBVIOUSLY, I'M STILL LUCKY TO BE
AT LEAST GOING ON VACATION,

13:46.967 --> 13:48.633
BUT I'M A LITTLE
DISAPPOINTED.

13:48.633 --> 13:50.133
I OBVIOUSLY REALLY DON'T
THINK IT'S FAIR

13:50.133 --> 13:52.200
THAT WE ALWAYS HAVE TO
CHANGE THINGS FOR JAZZ

13:52.200 --> 13:54.867
AND HER DOCTOR APPOINTMENTS,
BUT WE'RE JAZZ'S BROTHERS.

13:54.867 --> 13:56.067
WE'VE ALWAYS
BEEN THERE FOR HER,

13:56.067 --> 13:57.867
AND HER SURGERY
IS MORE IMPORTANT

13:57.867 --> 14:00.533
THAN GOING TO SEE
SOME ROCKS.

14:00.533 --> 14:02.167
DID YOU JUST CALL
THE GRAND CANYON SOME ROCKS?

14:02.167 --> 14:03.300
I MEAN, THEY ARE.

14:03.300 --> 14:04.633
IT'S A CANYON.

14:04.633 --> 14:07.367
BRO, I'M IN EARTH SCIENCE
WHERE THEY'RE JUST ROCKS.

14:07.367 --> 14:09.667
HERE'S THE THING.
SO AT SOME POINT IN YOUR LIVES,

14:09.667 --> 14:12.467
WE WILL GO
TO THE GRAND CANYON TOGETHER,

14:12.467 --> 14:14.300
AND I'LL TAKE
CARE OF THE BILL.

14:14.300 --> 14:16.733
-THANKS, MAN.
-YOU CAN HAVE YOUR STEAK BACK.

14:16.733 --> 14:19.600
-ATTA BOY.
-WELL, THEN, IT'S BEEN DECIDED.

14:19.600 --> 14:21.700
WE'RE GONNA DO
THE NEW YORK TRIP.

14:21.700 --> 14:22.933
I'LL TOAST TO THAT.

14:22.933 --> 14:24.233
AND WE'RE OWED A TRIP
TO THE GRAND CANYON.

14:24.233 --> 14:25.267
IT'S THE BIG APPLE.

14:25.267 --> 14:27.100
YOU GUYS ARE MAKING OUT
LIKE BANDITS.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.933
AND TO THE LAST CONSULT,
HOPEFULLY.

14:29.933 --> 14:39.567
**

14:39.567 --> 14:41.100
Jazz: DO YOU SEE ALL
OF THE BUTTERFLIES?

14:41.100 --> 14:42.533
WOW.

14:42.533 --> 14:44.400
I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE GOING
OUTSIDE THAT MUCH, BUT --

14:44.400 --> 14:46.567
NO. NO. NO.
I LOVE OUTDOORS,

14:46.567 --> 14:47.833
AS LONG
AS OUTDOORS LOVES ME.

14:47.833 --> 14:49.267
YOU JUST DON'T LIKE
WHAT IT DOES TO YOUR HAIR.

14:49.267 --> 14:51.300
Jazz:
NOW THAT I'M A LITTLE BIT OLDER,

14:51.300 --> 14:54.367
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH GRANDMA
HAS DEFINITELY CHANGED.

14:54.367 --> 14:56.833
WE DON'T GET TO HANG OUT,
JUST YOU AND ME VERY OFTEN.

14:56.833 --> 14:58.667
-BUT...
-VERY INFREQUENTLY.

14:58.667 --> 14:59.867
...I THINK YOU'RE
A COOL PERSON, GRANDMA.

14:59.867 --> 15:01.233
I LOVE THAT.

15:01.233 --> 15:03.333
OH, I LOVE YOU.

15:03.333 --> 15:05.500
WE TALK ABOUT
MORE SERIOUS STUFF.

15:05.500 --> 15:07.067
BEING A TEENAGER IS HARD.

15:07.067 --> 15:08.700
IT COMES WITH ALL THESE
DIFFERENT WORRIES,

15:08.700 --> 15:11.467
SO IT'S REALLY GREAT TO HAVE
SOMEONE LIKE HER IN MY LIFE.

15:11.467 --> 15:14.067
NOT ONLY IS SHE SUPER FUNNY
WITHOUT REALIZING IT,

15:14.067 --> 15:16.333
BUT SHE GIVES
AMAZING ADVICE.

15:16.333 --> 15:17.567
IT'S HOT.

15:17.567 --> 15:20.633
I'M AS SHINY
AS A NEW PENNY.

15:20.633 --> 15:22.733
YOU ARE SWEATING.

15:22.733 --> 15:23.867
YOU LOOK FINE, GRANDMA.

15:23.867 --> 15:25.200
YOU ALWAYS LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

15:25.200 --> 15:26.467
ALL RIGHT.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.500
SO, I WANT TO ASK YOU.

15:28.500 --> 15:31.433
MOM AND DAD MENTIONED
SOMETHING ABOUT A SOCIAL THING.

15:31.433 --> 15:35.067
OH, YEAH.
I WENT TO THIS MIXER RECENTLY.

15:35.067 --> 15:37.267
IT WAS AT
THIS LGBTQ CENTER.

15:37.267 --> 15:38.833
-MM-HMM.
-THEY'RE ALL REALLY COOL.

15:38.833 --> 15:40.633
I COULD BE GOOD FRIENDS
WITH THEM.

15:40.633 --> 15:45.533
AND, ALSO, I JUST THINK
THEY MAY OPEN UP DOORS FOR ME

15:45.533 --> 15:46.833
TO FIND NEW FRIENDS AS WELL

15:46.833 --> 15:49.367
AND POTENTIALLY A PARTNER,
A RELATIONSHIP.

15:49.367 --> 15:51.067
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU HAD GOTTEN TO THIS.

15:51.067 --> 15:52.833
WELL,
THIS IS A NEW HAPPENING.

15:52.833 --> 15:55.067
-YEP.
-YOU'RE OPEN FOR THE HAPPENING.

15:55.067 --> 15:56.200
-I'M REALLY OPEN.
-I'M SO EXCITED TO HEAR THAT.

15:56.200 --> 15:57.333
I'M MORE OPEN THAN EVER.

15:57.333 --> 16:00.433
SO IS THIS A SOUL MATE
OR A SEXUAL MATE?

16:00.433 --> 16:02.500
HAVE YOU DIFFERENTIATED?

16:02.500 --> 16:05.067
GRANDMA, DO I LOOK
LIKE A SEXUAL BEING?

16:05.067 --> 16:06.567
I'M NOT JUDGING YOU.

16:06.567 --> 16:08.867
I'M TRULY ASKING, JUST TO TRY
TO SEE WHERE YOUR THINKING IS.

16:08.867 --> 16:10.167
-I THINK --

16:10.167 --> 16:11.400
YOU KNOW, MARCI BOWERS,

16:11.400 --> 16:14.167
SHE SAID I NEED TO START
FIGURING THINGS OUT

16:14.167 --> 16:15.833
IN TERMS OF TRYING
TO HAVE AN ORGASM,

16:15.833 --> 16:18.533
SO, I MEAN, THIS ISN'T
REALLY MY INTENTION,

16:18.533 --> 16:23.200
BUT IT COULD BE A BENEFIT
OF BEING IN A RELATIONSHIP.

16:23.200 --> 16:25.233
-WOW.
-IF I EXPERIMENT SEXUALLY,

16:25.233 --> 16:27.500
THEN MAYBE I'LL FIND OUT
WHAT I LIKE,

16:27.500 --> 16:29.600
AND THEN I COULD HAVE
ORGASMS MY ENTIRE LIFE.

16:29.600 --> 16:30.800
YAY.

16:30.800 --> 16:34.367
YOU'D HAVE TO MISS
A FEW DAYS OF SCHOOL.

16:34.367 --> 16:36.067
SEE, I'M BEING
FACETIOUS ABOUT IT.

16:36.067 --> 16:37.800
Jacky:
JAZZ IS STILL AN ADOLESCENT.

16:37.800 --> 16:39.333
SHE STILL NEEDS TIME.

16:39.333 --> 16:44.300
SHE IS ONLY 16 GOING ON 17,
BUT SHE'S FINDING HERSELF,

16:44.300 --> 16:46.900
AND SHE HAS NOT BEEN PRIVY

16:46.900 --> 16:50.100
TO WHAT I THINK A LOT OF
THE GIRLS HER AGE HAVE BEEN.

16:50.100 --> 16:52.067
SHE'S LOST THAT,

16:52.067 --> 16:55.200
AND I THINK THAT YOU
CAN'T FIND WHAT YOU'VE LOST.

16:55.200 --> 16:57.133
SHE'S GOING TO HAVE
TO PLAY CATCH-UP.

16:57.133 --> 17:01.100
ARE YOU STARTING TO DEFINE WHAT
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, PERHAPS?

17:01.100 --> 17:04.067
WELL,
I FEEL LIKE INTELLIGENCE

17:04.067 --> 17:05.367
IS SOMETHING REALLY
IMPORTANT TO ME.

17:05.367 --> 17:06.933
SO THAT WOULD BE
TOP OF YOUR LIST?

17:06.933 --> 17:08.200
-UP THERE.
-YEAH.

17:08.200 --> 17:10.933
ANOTHER THING IS, THEY NEED
TO BE ABLE TO HANDLE ME.

17:10.933 --> 17:12.333
I'M A LOT.

17:12.333 --> 17:13.633
-YEAH.
-I'M A LOT, A LOT.

17:13.633 --> 17:16.533
YEAH. YOU ARE A VERY
COMPLICATED YOUNG LADY.

17:16.533 --> 17:19.600
I WANT TO FIND SOMEONE
WHO LOOKS AT MY PROBLEMS

17:19.600 --> 17:24.067
AND REALIZES THAT IT'S WHAT
MAKES ME BEAUTIFUL AS A PERSON.

17:24.067 --> 17:26.500
WOW.
THAT'S QUITE A REMARK.

17:26.500 --> 17:30.600
THE FACT THAT SHE REALLY
WANTS TO LOVE, IT'S HER RIGHT.

17:30.600 --> 17:34.667
IT'S EVERY HUMAN BEING'S
RIGHT TO LOVE AND BE LOVED,

17:34.667 --> 17:36.533
AND I THINK IT'S FABULOUS.

17:36.533 --> 17:37.967
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU.

17:37.967 --> 17:40.067
-YEAH.

17:40.067 --> 17:41.133
YEAH.

17:41.133 --> 17:43.800
I DO LOVE GRANDPA,
BUT LOVE CHANGES.

17:43.800 --> 17:47.167
EARLY LOVE, WHEN YOU MEET
SOMEBODY, IS VERY EXCITING...

17:47.167 --> 17:51.233
-IT'S PASSIONATE.
-...AND PASSION AND PHYSICAL,

17:51.233 --> 17:52.600
AND THEN IT MOVES ALONG,

17:52.600 --> 17:55.533
AND AS THE YEARS GO,
IT TAKES ON A DIFFERENT FLAVOR.

17:55.533 --> 17:58.067
IT CHANGES.

17:58.067 --> 18:01.233
WOULD YOU SAY THAT ALL
THE FLAVORS ARE EQUIVALENT,

18:01.233 --> 18:02.300
OR DO YOU THINK
THE BEGINNING...

18:02.300 --> 18:04.100
-NO.

18:04.100 --> 18:06.267
THE HOTTEST,
MOST EXCITING TIME

18:06.267 --> 18:08.067
IS WHEN TWO PEOPLE
MEET EACH OTHER.

18:08.067 --> 18:09.700
YOU CAN'T SLEEP.
YOU CAN'T EAT.

18:09.700 --> 18:11.367
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

18:11.367 --> 18:12.800
IT'S ALL GEARED
IN ONE DIRECTION.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.133
SO IT'S NOT -- IT DOESN'T FEEL
AS GOOD ANYMORE, THEN.

18:15.133 --> 18:17.533
NO. NO.
IT'S NOT MEASURABLE.

18:17.533 --> 18:18.900
IS IT ALL EASY?
IT'S A LOT OF WORK.

18:18.900 --> 18:20.633
RELATIONSHIPS
ARE A LOT OF WORK.

18:20.633 --> 18:23.767
Jazz: IT'S REALLY SPECIAL THAT
MY GRANDMA IS WILLING

18:23.767 --> 18:25.067
TO TALK WITH ME,

18:25.067 --> 18:26.867
NO MATTER WHAT THE SUBJECT IS,

18:26.867 --> 18:29.433
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE
EVERYTHING SHE HAS TO SAY

18:29.433 --> 18:30.967
BECAUSE SHE'S A WISE WOMAN.

18:30.967 --> 18:34.300
SHE'S LIVED A LONG TIME, AND SHE
KNOWS WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT.

18:34.300 --> 18:37.133
YOU BLOW ME AWAY IN WHERE
YOU HAVE COME

18:37.133 --> 18:38.967
IN THESE LAST MANY MONTHS.

18:38.967 --> 18:42.067
IT'S LIKE A -- LIKE,
WE'RE IN BUTTERFLY WORLD.

18:42.067 --> 18:44.733
I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE COMING
OUT OF YOUR COCOON,

18:44.733 --> 18:46.100
AND I THINK
IT'S A GREAT ANALOGY.

18:46.100 --> 18:48.433
YOU'RE GROWING.
YOU'RE EXPANDING.

18:48.433 --> 18:50.500
THERE'S ANOTHER JAZZ
EMERGING,

18:50.500 --> 18:52.600
AND I'M SO PROUD
TO BE YOUR GRANDMA.

18:52.600 --> 18:56.067
I AM BLOWN AWAY THAT SHE TURNS
TO ME, NOT A GIRLFRIEND,

18:56.067 --> 18:57.567
NOT MOMMY, WHICH SHE MAY.

18:57.567 --> 19:00.733
I DON'T KNOW, BUT HERE I AM,
THE OLD GRANDMA,

19:00.733 --> 19:04.433
AND THAT JUST WAS ENDEARING,
SO ENDEARING.

19:04.433 --> 19:06.100
WELL, I NEED TO DO
YOUR MAKEUP ONE DAY.

19:06.100 --> 19:07.433
HERE WE GO AGAIN.

19:07.433 --> 19:10.500
WHAT? YOU DO A GOOD JOB, BUT YOU
PUT TOO MUCH BLUSH ON THE --

19:10.500 --> 19:12.300
WELL,
WE'LL SWEAT IT OFF.

19:13.967 --> 19:16.167
I'M SUPER STOKED ABOUT
GOING WHITE-WATER RAFTING.

19:16.167 --> 19:17.067
KEEP GOING.
WE'RE GETTING THERE.

19:17.067 --> 19:19.433
GO. GO. WHOO!

19:19.433 --> 19:21.733
I FEEL LIKE ALMOST
YOU'RE HAPPY ABOUT THIS, DAD,

19:21.733 --> 19:23.067
'CAUSE YOU'RE
GETTING YOUR WAY.

19:23.067 --> 19:24.667
GETTING HIS WAY?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

19:24.667 --> 19:25.700
JAZZ --

19:25.700 --> 19:26.867
IS IT TRUE THAT
YOU DON'T WANT ME

19:26.867 --> 19:28.633
TO GET THE SURGERY
UNTIL I'M AN ADULT?

19:28.633 --> 19:30.333
IS IT TRUE?

19:33.333 --> 19:39.767
**

19:39.767 --> 19:42.733
WE'RE AT THE AIRPORT,
ON OUR WAY TO MEET DR. TING...

19:42.733 --> 19:44.267
-DR. TING.
-...IN NEW YORK.

19:44.267 --> 19:46.233
IT'S GONNA BE EXCITING
BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA LEARN

19:46.233 --> 19:47.933
MORE ABOUT
THE PERITONEAL LINING.

19:47.933 --> 19:50.833
[ WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY
OVER P.A. ]

19:50.833 --> 19:53.733
I REALLY WANT TO MAKE THIS VISIT
TO NEW YORK MORE OF A VACATION.

19:53.733 --> 19:55.667
YES, I KNOW
WE HAVE TO SEE DR. TING,

19:55.667 --> 19:57.633
BUT I REALLY WANT US
TO SPEND TIME TOGETHER,

19:57.633 --> 19:59.300
AND I DON'T WANT
THIS APPOINTMENT

19:59.300 --> 20:01.633
TO BE LIKE THIS DARK CLOUD
HANGING OVER OUR HEAD.

20:01.633 --> 20:04.767
I JUST WANT JAZZ TO BE
CAREFREE AND HAVE FUN.

20:04.767 --> 20:09.900
**

20:09.900 --> 20:15.067
**

20:15.067 --> 20:16.900
Greg:
LOOK HOW PRETTY IT IS HERE.

20:16.900 --> 20:18.567
I'M EXCITED TO SEE THE SIGHTS.

20:18.567 --> 20:22.300
I MEAN, I THINK CENTRAL PARK
IS AN AWESOME PLACE TO GO.

20:22.300 --> 20:23.700
PRETTY.

20:23.700 --> 20:26.567
I FEEL BAD BECAUSE I KNOW
THAT THE KIDS HAD TO SACRIFICE

20:26.567 --> 20:29.100
AND ACCEPT THE FACT
THAT WE NEEDED TO DEAL

20:29.100 --> 20:31.333
WITH JAZZ'S
MEDICAL CONSULTATION.

20:31.333 --> 20:32.833
MOM, THINK FAST.

20:32.833 --> 20:35.300
-BUT EVERY NOW AND THEN...
-AW, YOU HAD IT.

20:35.300 --> 20:37.333
...YOU HAVE TO BE PRACTICAL,
AND WE HAVE TO BE ABLE

20:37.333 --> 20:40.867
TO MAKE THE BEST
OF A SITUATION.

20:40.867 --> 20:42.367
Jazz: HERE, I'M GONNA TRY
MY OTHER THROW.

20:42.367 --> 20:43.867
IT'S GOING INTO
THE SECOND POCKET.

20:43.867 --> 20:45.533
-THAT WAS TO ARI.

20:45.533 --> 20:46.933
AW.

20:46.933 --> 20:48.300
AND THEY'RE PROBABLY THINKING,

20:48.300 --> 20:49.667
"DAD OWES US A TRIP
TO THE GRAND CANYON."

20:50.933 --> 20:53.400
-OH.

20:53.400 --> 20:55.967
Jeanette:
IMPRESSIVE.

20:55.967 --> 20:57.200
I LIKE IT OVER HERE.

20:57.200 --> 20:58.600
YOU DID GOOD, MOM.
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.667
THANKS, JAZZ.

21:00.667 --> 21:02.633
ARI,
COME TO THE BRIDGE WITH ME.

21:02.633 --> 21:06.500
I'M VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE AN
OLDER SISTER THAT I CAN RELY ON.

21:06.500 --> 21:08.333
THIS IS SO ROMANTIC.

21:08.333 --> 21:10.400
I FEEL LIKE THIS WOULD BE
A GOOD PLACE IF YOU WERE, LIKE,

21:10.400 --> 21:11.667
ON A DATE WITH SOMEONE.

21:11.667 --> 21:13.300
Ari: YEAH.
IT WOULD BE NICE.

21:13.300 --> 21:17.133
I FEEL LIKE I'M DEFINITELY ABLE
TO BE MORE VULNERABLE WITH ARI.

21:17.133 --> 21:19.400
I JUST FEEL LIKE I COULD
GO TO HER WITH ANYTHING.

21:19.400 --> 21:22.600
THIS CONSULTATION IS LIKE --
UGH.

21:22.600 --> 21:23.767
I'M JUST NOT READY.

21:23.767 --> 21:26.233
WELL, THAT'S TOTALLY
UNDERSTANDABLE.

21:26.233 --> 21:29.433
I HAVE A REALLY BAD FEELING HE'S
GONNA EXAMINE ME AND BE LIKE,

21:29.433 --> 21:31.667
"WE GOT TO DO
THIS TISSUE EXPANDER."

21:31.667 --> 21:33.633
YOU JUST GOT TO BE LIKE, "YOU
KNOW WHAT? THIS IS HOW IT IS.

21:33.633 --> 21:36.133
THIS IS WHAT I'M DOING,
AND I'M DOING IT."

21:36.133 --> 21:38.233
BUT THERE'S SO MANY PROBLEMS
THAT COME WITH IT.

21:38.233 --> 21:41.067
LIKE, I WOULD HAVE TO THINK
ABOUT THE CLOTHES THAT I WEAR,

21:41.067 --> 21:42.667
WHAT ACTIVITIES
I'M ABLE TO DO.

21:42.667 --> 21:44.467
LIKE,
WOULD I BE ABLE TO, LIKE,

21:44.467 --> 21:46.933
PURSUE A RELATIONSHIP
WITH THIS TISSUE THING?

21:46.933 --> 21:48.700
-YEAH.
-IT'S, LIKE, UNCOMFORTABLE.

21:48.700 --> 21:50.833
LIKE, THIS IS MY BODY,
YOU KNOW?

21:50.833 --> 21:53.400
YEAH, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY,
IF YOU DO THIS EXPANDER THING,

21:53.400 --> 21:55.367
YOU GET WHAT
YOU'VE ALWAYS WANTED.

21:55.367 --> 21:56.500
-THAT'S TRUE.

21:56.500 --> 21:57.633
LIKE, IT'S BABY STEPS.

21:57.633 --> 21:59.100
BUT WILL I?

21:59.100 --> 22:02.800
BUT YOU CAN NEVER BE SURE
ABOUT THAT, AND THAT'S SCARY.

22:02.800 --> 22:04.433
IT'S DEFINITELY
INTERESTING TO HEAR

22:04.433 --> 22:06.900
JAZZ SAY
SHE'S SCARED OF SOMETHING

22:06.900 --> 22:09.600
'CAUSE I JUST LOOK AT HER AS
SOMEONE WHO'S PRETTY FEARLESS.

22:09.600 --> 22:11.167
WELL, I HAVE TO GO
TO THERAPY TOO.

22:11.167 --> 22:12.400
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

22:12.400 --> 22:14.233
SO, LIKE, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO TALK ABOUT

22:14.233 --> 22:15.933
ALL THIS STUFF
WITH MY THERAPIST.

22:15.933 --> 22:18.700
LIKE, WHAT'S THE WORST
THING THAT COULD HAPPEN?

22:18.700 --> 22:22.633
THEY DON'T RECOMMEND ME
FOR THE PROCEDURE,

22:22.633 --> 22:24.067
AND THAT COULD BE
FOR MULTIPLE REASONS.

22:24.067 --> 22:25.433
THEY COULD SAY
I'M MENTALLY UNSTABLE.

22:25.433 --> 22:27.200
I DO HAVE DEPRESSION
AND ANXIETY.

22:27.200 --> 22:28.633
I'M DIAGNOSED.

22:28.633 --> 22:29.967
MM-HMM.

22:29.967 --> 22:31.967
OR THEY COULD SAY,
"OH, SHE'S A BINGE EATER.

22:31.967 --> 22:33.833
LIKE, SHE'S NOT TAKING
CARE OF HER BODY.

22:33.833 --> 22:36.600
HOW IS SHE GONNA TAKE
CARE OF HER NEW VAGINA?

22:36.600 --> 22:37.967
LIKE, HOW IS SHE GONNA
BE ABLE TO DILATE?"

22:37.967 --> 22:40.500
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

22:40.500 --> 22:43.533
FOR NOW, I THINK
IT'S IMPORTANT TO JUST WAIT

22:43.533 --> 22:44.800
AND THEN BE VERY PRESENT.

22:44.800 --> 22:46.600
YEAH,
BUT HOW CAN I BE PRESENT

22:46.600 --> 22:48.067
IF I'M ALWAYS THINKING
ABOUT SURGERY,

22:48.067 --> 22:49.767
IF I'M ALWAYS THINKING
ABOUT THE FUTURE?

22:49.767 --> 22:53.367
I THINK THAT THE FACT THAT HER
WHOLE LIFE HAS BEEN A TRANSITION

22:53.367 --> 22:56.333
KIND OF MAKES YOU
LOOK FORWARD TO A FUTURE

22:56.333 --> 22:58.900
AND FINALLY BEING TRANSITIONED.

22:58.900 --> 23:01.967
IT'S HARD TO JUST BE, LIKE,
CONTENT WITH WHERE YOU'RE AT NOW

23:01.967 --> 23:06.333
WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING TO JUST BE
YOUR FULL SELF IN THE FUTURE.

23:06.333 --> 23:08.367
WHENEVER I'M THINKING
A LOT OR, LIKE,

23:08.367 --> 23:10.067
JUST STRESSED OUT
ABOUT SOMETHING,

23:10.067 --> 23:11.133
I USUALLY JUST, LIKE,

23:11.133 --> 23:12.667
GO DO SOMETHING
TO GET MY MIND OFF OF IT.

23:12.667 --> 23:14.767
AND I JUST FOCUS
ON WHAT I'M DOING.

23:14.767 --> 23:16.733
IT'S SO STUPID.

23:16.733 --> 23:18.433
I MEAN,
THIS IS JUST WHO I AM,

23:18.433 --> 23:22.067
AND I JUST WANT MY BODY
TO REPRESENT THAT

23:22.067 --> 23:23.933
BECAUSE IT MAKES ME
FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE

23:23.933 --> 23:26.167
BECAUSE I DON'T FEEL
COMFORTABLE IN MY OWN SKIN.

23:26.167 --> 23:27.633
YOU KNOW?

23:27.633 --> 23:30.533
MAKES SENSE.

23:30.533 --> 23:33.433
AT THE END OF THE DAY, IT'S
A VERY JUST SCARY SITUATION,

23:33.433 --> 23:37.300
AND THERE'S NOT MUCH YOU CAN DO
BESIDES JUST BE THERE FOR HER.

23:37.300 --> 23:39.200
I'M SCARED.

23:39.200 --> 23:48.367
**

23:49.600 --> 23:50.933
DADDY AND I REALLY THINK
YOU SHOULD WEAR SOMETHING

23:50.933 --> 23:53.267
THAT COVERS YOU UP MORE.

23:53.267 --> 23:56.367
BECAUSE YOUR BOOBS
ARE HANGING OUT.

23:56.367 --> 23:58.500
Sander:
JAZZ HAS TOO MUCH CLEAVAGE?

23:58.500 --> 23:59.567
YEAH.

23:59.567 --> 24:04.433
-YOU GO, GIRL.
-SHUT UP, SANDER.

24:04.433 --> 24:06.800
Jazz: TODAY, MY FAMILY AND I
ARE TAKING A DAY TRIP

24:06.800 --> 24:09.733
TO GO TO WHITE-WATER RAFTING,
AND WE LOVE DOING THIS STUFF.

24:09.733 --> 24:13.067
WE'RE PRETTY ADVENTUROUS
AND LOVE BEING OUTSIDE.

24:13.067 --> 24:15.300
Jeanette:
COUSIN DEBBIE'S CALLING.
EVERYBODY BE QUIET.

24:15.300 --> 24:16.400
HELLO.

24:16.400 --> 24:17.400
Debbie: Hey, cuz.

24:17.400 --> 24:18.633
HI.
I HAVE YOU ON SPEAKER.

24:18.633 --> 24:19.667
EVERYBODY'S HERE.

24:19.667 --> 24:21.267
Oh, my gosh.
Where are you?

24:21.267 --> 24:22.567
WE'RE GOING RAFTING TODAY.

24:22.567 --> 24:24.600
I was calling to see
if you wanted to go

24:24.600 --> 24:27.067
To a movie or out to dinner,

24:27.067 --> 24:29.567
something calm like that,
you know?

24:29.567 --> 24:31.333
WHEN I GET BACK,
I'D LOVE TO.

24:31.333 --> 24:32.800
Jeanette: DEBBIE IS A THERAPIST.

24:32.800 --> 24:34.700
SHE WORKS WITH A LOT
OF TRANS PATIENTS,

24:34.700 --> 24:38.767
AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY
TO WRITE THAT SECOND LETTER.

24:38.767 --> 24:42.067
Debbie: Listen, I've been
reaching out to see who Jazz

24:42.067 --> 24:44.167
might be able
to discuss surgery

24:44.167 --> 24:46.933
and to feel better
and more prepared,

24:46.933 --> 24:51.733
and I think I found
the most perfect match.

24:51.733 --> 24:53.200
OH, GREAT.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.767
I KNOW
SHE NEEDS A THERAPIST

24:54.767 --> 24:56.733
BECAUSE SHE HAS TO HAVE
THAT SECOND LETTER.

24:56.733 --> 24:58.867
DEFINITELY SEND ME
ALL THE INFORMATION.

24:58.867 --> 25:00.700
Okay.
Sounds like a plan.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.333
ALL RIGHTY.
LOVE YOU.

25:02.333 --> 25:03.467
THANK YOU.
-I love you all.

25:03.467 --> 25:04.933
Love you too. Bye.
-BYE.

25:04.933 --> 25:06.133
BYE, DEBBIE.

25:06.133 --> 25:08.100
JAZZ IS NOT A BIG
FAN OF THERAPY,

25:08.100 --> 25:10.933
BUT SHE CAN'T HAVE THE SURGERY
WITHOUT THE LETTERS,

25:10.933 --> 25:13.700
SO THE SOONER WE GET
THE BALL ROLLING, THE BETTER

25:13.700 --> 25:15.667
SO WE DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

25:15.667 --> 25:18.133
SO, JAZZ?

25:18.133 --> 25:20.867
Jazz: WHAT?
YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE THERAPY.

25:20.867 --> 25:23.367
THIS IS FOR THE SURGERY, SO
I'M WILLING TO JUST SUCK IT UP

25:23.367 --> 25:25.633
AND DO IT, BUT IT'S GONNA
BE ANNOYING ANYWAY.

25:25.633 --> 25:27.433
DO YOU KNOW HOW CLOSE
IN PROXIMITY

25:27.433 --> 25:30.067
DOES THE LETTER HAVE TO BE
TO THE ACTUAL SURGERY?

25:30.067 --> 25:32.600
MARCI SAID THAT YOU COULD
DO IT A MONTH BEFORE,

25:32.600 --> 25:33.800
AND IT'S NO PROBLEM.

25:33.800 --> 25:35.933
HOWEVER, JUST BECAUSE
OF MY CIRCUMSTANCES,

25:35.933 --> 25:38.300
IT'S BETTER IF I DO IT
A LITTLE BIT SOONER,

25:38.300 --> 25:40.700
BUT THE SURGERY IS LESS
THAN A YEAR AWAY, DAD,

25:40.700 --> 25:41.933
AND WE GOT TO --

25:41.933 --> 25:43.633
WELL, WE'RE NOT
100% SURE OF THAT.

25:43.633 --> 25:45.867
WE HAVEN'T MET WITH
DR. TING.

25:45.867 --> 25:48.900
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THOSE
OTHER REQUIREMENTS ARE,

25:48.900 --> 25:50.300
THE TIMING OF IT.

25:50.300 --> 25:52.267
-WHATEVER.
-THAT COULD FACTOR IN.

25:52.267 --> 25:54.533
I FEEL LIKE ALMOST
YOU'RE HAPPY ABOUT THIS, DAD,

25:54.533 --> 25:55.867
'CAUSE YOU'RE
GETTING YOUR WAY.

25:55.867 --> 25:57.467
GETTING HIS WAY?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

25:57.467 --> 26:00.367
I CAN HEAR THE UNDERLYING
EXCITEMENT IN YOUR VOICE.

26:00.367 --> 26:03.833
WHEN I SAID, LIKE, "GET THE
SURGERY IN LESS THAN A YEAR,"

26:03.833 --> 26:06.400
YOU'RE LIKE, "WELL, THAT MIGHT
NOT BE A POSSIBILITY."

26:06.400 --> 26:11.533
JAZZ, YOU NEED TO BE RESPECTFUL
OF YOUR PARENTS AND YOUR ELDERS.

26:11.533 --> 26:12.800
I'M JUST SAYING
HOW I FEEL.

26:12.800 --> 26:16.200
LIKE, I FEEL LIKE YOU
ARE A LITTLE BIT HAPPY.

26:16.200 --> 26:17.767
IS IT TRUE THAT
YOU DON'T WANT ME

26:17.767 --> 26:19.733
TO GET THE SURGERY
UNTIL I'M AN ADULT?

26:19.733 --> 26:20.767
IS IT TRUE?

26:24.433 --> 26:26.067
IS IT TRUE THAT
YOU DON'T WANT ME

26:26.067 --> 26:27.967
TO GET THE SURGERY
UNTIL I'M AN ADULT?

26:27.967 --> 26:29.067
IS IT TRUE?

26:29.067 --> 26:30.367
THAT'S NOT
SPECIFICALLY THE ISSUE.

26:30.367 --> 26:32.133
AGE IS NOT THE ISSUE.

26:32.133 --> 26:34.167
THERE'S A LOT GOING ON
IN JAZZ'S LIFE.

26:34.167 --> 26:36.400
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS
TO CONTEMPLATE.

26:36.400 --> 26:39.467
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT JAZZ IS
IN THE RIGHT FRAME OF MIND,

26:39.467 --> 26:41.667
THAT SHE'S
EMOTIONALLY READY.

26:41.667 --> 26:43.633
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
THAT THE TIMING

26:43.633 --> 26:45.567
IS TRULY RIGHT FOR JAZZ.

26:45.567 --> 26:47.867
THAT'S ALL
I REALLY CARE ABOUT.

26:47.867 --> 26:50.400
SOUNDS LIKE YOU MAY NEED
TIME TO RECOVER,

26:50.400 --> 26:53.267
AND I DON'T WANT YOU
TO HAVE TO RUSH RECOVERY.

26:53.267 --> 26:54.300
WHY WOULD I RUSH IT?

26:54.300 --> 26:55.567
IF I GET IT AT
THE BEGINNING OF SUMMER,

26:55.567 --> 26:56.933
I WOULD HAVE ALL SUMMER LONG.

26:56.933 --> 26:58.667
I DON'T KNOW THAT
THAT'S ENOUGH TIME.

26:58.667 --> 27:00.767
SKYLAR DID IT AT
THE BEGINNING OF SUMMER.

27:00.767 --> 27:01.800
SHE'S FINE NOW.

27:01.800 --> 27:03.800
IF YOU END UP HAVING
THE EXPANDERS,

27:03.800 --> 27:07.533
IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THAT IS
A PRETTY LENGTHY PERIOD OF TIME

27:07.533 --> 27:09.333
FOR YOU TO GO THROUGH
THIS PROCESS,

27:09.333 --> 27:11.767
AND I DON'T KNOW THAT WE WOULD
WANT TO RUSH THAT PROCESS.

27:11.767 --> 27:13.800
SO WHEN DO YOU THINK IT'S GONNA
BE BETTER FOR ME TO DO THAT,

27:13.800 --> 27:15.400
WHEN I'M ENTERING COLLEGE?

27:15.400 --> 27:17.367
I THINK YOU END UP
NEEDING A GAP YEAR,

27:17.367 --> 27:20.300
IF YOU GO THROUGH
THAT PROCESS.

27:20.300 --> 27:23.367
I DEFINITELY JUST FEEL
LIKE MY DAD IS REALLY CONCERNED

27:23.367 --> 27:25.500
ABOUT ME,
AND HE'S PROTECTIVE.

27:25.500 --> 27:28.167
HOWEVER, I ALSO KNOW
THAT HE THINKS

27:28.167 --> 27:30.467
I'M NOT MATURE ENOUGH
TO MAKE THIS DECISION

27:30.467 --> 27:31.967
AND THAT, YOU KNOW,

27:31.967 --> 27:35.100
MAYBE I SHOULD WAIT TO GET THIS
OPERATION DONE WHEN I'M OLDER.

27:35.100 --> 27:39.433
I JUST WISH THAT
HE WAS MORE SUPPORTIVE.

27:39.433 --> 27:41.433
I DON'T KNOW WHY
WE'RE MAKING CONCLUSIONS

27:41.433 --> 27:43.100
BEFORE
YOU GUYS SEE DR. TING.

27:43.100 --> 27:44.967
I FEEL LIKE THAT'S GONNA
GIVE ALL THE ANSWERS.

27:44.967 --> 27:47.367
ARGUING BACK AND FORTH
AND GETTING MAD AT DAD

27:47.367 --> 27:49.667
AND WHATNOT IS NOT WORTH IT.
-I'M NOT ARGUING WITH DAD.

27:49.667 --> 27:51.333
-ALL RIGHT. LET'S --
-I'M JUST SAYING, LIKE...

27:51.333 --> 27:53.967
-ALL RIGHT. I THINK...
-...I DON'T KNOW HOW HE FEELS.

27:53.967 --> 27:55.567
...WE'VE BELABORED THIS LONG
ENOUGH, AND WE ALL GET IT.

27:55.567 --> 27:57.733
Greg: ALL OF THESE DECISIONS
THAT ARE BEING MADE

27:57.733 --> 27:59.700
ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT,

27:59.700 --> 28:01.900
AND THEY HAVE TO BE
CAREFULLY THOUGHT THROUGH,

28:01.900 --> 28:03.167
AND AS PARENTS,

28:03.167 --> 28:05.867
IT'S OUR PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY
TO DO THAT

28:05.867 --> 28:10.833
AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING
IS AS PERFECT AS IT CAN BE.

28:10.833 --> 28:16.867
**

28:16.867 --> 28:22.867
**

28:22.867 --> 28:24.900
-JENNINGS FAMILY, WELCOME.

28:24.900 --> 28:26.233
WELCOME TO
WHITEWATER CHALLENGERS.

28:26.233 --> 28:28.067
I'M SCOTT.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

28:28.067 --> 28:29.500
THANK GOD WE'RE HERE
AT THE RIVER.

28:29.500 --> 28:32.833
I JUST WANT TO ENJOY MYSELF,
RAFTING WITH MY FAMILY.

28:32.833 --> 28:34.567
-YEAH. DEFINITELY.

28:34.567 --> 28:35.900
Scott: ALL RIGHT.

28:35.900 --> 28:37.567
I'M SUPER STOKE ABOUT
GOING WHITE-WATER RAFTING.

28:37.567 --> 28:39.500
I KNOW JEANETTE'S...

28:39.500 --> 28:41.933
I GREW UP ON THE WATER,
WHITE-WATER RAFTING.

28:41.933 --> 28:43.433
WELL, MORE LIKE CANOEING.

28:43.433 --> 28:45.067
THIS IS SOMETHING
I CAN DO.

28:45.067 --> 28:46.600
LET'S GET YOU SUITED UP.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.867
-I SURE HOPE SO.

28:48.867 --> 28:50.533
I HAD A PEP TALK
THIS MORNING, SO...

28:50.533 --> 28:52.400
Griffen: HOW'S IT RUNNING TODAY,
NICE AND FAST?

28:52.400 --> 28:54.200
-COLD.
-COLD. NICE. PERFECT.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.267
THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE.
-NO. WE'RE GOOD. WE'RE GOOD.

28:55.267 --> 28:57.967
Greg:
WHEN WE HAVE FAMILY ARGUMENTS,

28:57.967 --> 28:59.467
NOBODY HOLDS ANY GRUDGES.

28:59.467 --> 29:01.933
EVERYBODY MOVES FORWARD.

29:01.933 --> 29:04.600
I KNOW
ONCE WE GET ON THE RAFTS,

29:04.600 --> 29:06.467
ALL THAT B.S.
WILL BE BEHIND US.

29:06.467 --> 29:08.067
I'M GONNA
GIVE YOU GUYS PFDs.

29:08.067 --> 29:10.733
THESE ARE YOUR
PERSONAL FLOTATION DEVICES

29:10.733 --> 29:13.233
FOR WHEN YOU ACTUALLY
FALL IN THE RIVER,

29:13.233 --> 29:15.767
I MEAN,
TO KEEP YOU WARM.

29:15.767 --> 29:17.467
-SAY CHEESE.
-CHEESE.

29:17.467 --> 29:19.500
Scott:
ALL RIGHT, WELL, LET'S GET IN
OUR RAFT AND GET ON THE RIVER.

29:19.500 --> 29:21.067
GO AHEAD AND HOP IN,
NEXT SET OF PEOPLE.

29:21.067 --> 29:23.467
Greg: I THINK THE NICE THING
ABOUT RAFTING IS

29:23.467 --> 29:25.667
YOU'RE ALL IN ONE PLACE.
-GOING ON OUR WAY.

29:25.667 --> 29:27.267
YOU'RE A CAPTIVE AUDIENCE
WITH EACH OTHER.

29:27.267 --> 29:29.900
YOU HAVE TO DEAL
AND COMMUNICATE

29:29.900 --> 29:32.167
AND HAVE FUN TOGETHER,
AND THAT MAKES FOR

29:32.167 --> 29:34.933
A PERFECT ENVIRONMENT
AS A FAMILY, I THINK.

29:34.933 --> 29:37.233
ALL RIGHT. SO LET'S ALL
TAKE A FEW STROKES FORWARD.

29:37.233 --> 29:38.600
HERE COMES A BUMP.

29:38.600 --> 29:41.400
-WHOO!
-JEANETTE.

29:41.400 --> 29:42.700
Jeanette:
OH, THAT'S COLD.

29:42.700 --> 29:44.633
Griffen: WE'RE ON THE RIVER
AND MOVING VERY FAST.

29:44.633 --> 29:46.733
AT ALL TIMES,
YOU'RE ROWING, PADDLING.

29:46.733 --> 29:48.567
WE'RE GETTING STUCK ON ROCKS.

29:48.567 --> 29:50.433
THERE'S SO MUCH GOING ON
IN SUCH A SHORT TIME,

29:50.433 --> 29:54.167
AND I COULD SEE OUR FAMILY
REALLY COMING TOGETHER.

29:54.167 --> 29:55.967
Scott: ALL FORWARD.
ALL FORWARD.

29:55.967 --> 29:57.300
ALL FORWARD.
KEEP GOING.

29:57.300 --> 29:58.567
WE'RE GETTING THERE.
WE'RE GETTING THERE.

29:58.567 --> 30:00.333
GO. GO. GO.

30:00.333 --> 30:02.467
ALL FORWARD.
COME ON.

30:02.467 --> 30:04.600
Jazz: THIS IS DEFINITELY HELPING
TO GET MY MIND

30:04.600 --> 30:07.600
OFF THE ARGUMENT WITH MY DAD.

30:07.600 --> 30:10.100
I FEEL LIKE WE'RE DOING
REALLY GREAT AS A TEAM,

30:10.100 --> 30:13.167
AND THAT'S WHAT
MAKES IT ENJOYABLE.

30:13.167 --> 30:14.567
WHOO!

30:14.567 --> 30:16.967
Jeanette: NO MATTER WHAT WE DO
OR WHERE WE GO,

30:16.967 --> 30:18.967
OUR FAMILY HAS FUN TOGETHER.

30:18.967 --> 30:20.667
WE LIKE EACH OTHER.

30:20.667 --> 30:22.800
NOT ALL FAMILIES
LIKE EACH OTHER.

30:22.800 --> 30:23.800
COME ON, JAZZ.

30:23.800 --> 30:25.500
GO FOR IT, GIRL!
GO FOR IT!

30:25.500 --> 30:27.767
WHOO!

30:27.767 --> 30:29.833
Greg: I THINK IT'S
REALLY IMPORTANT --

30:29.833 --> 30:31.467
ACTUALLY, I CAN'T THINK
OF ANYTHING

30:31.467 --> 30:34.567
MORE IMPORTANT
THAN FAMILY VACATIONS.

30:34.567 --> 30:37.100
THAT WAS SO GRACEFUL.

30:40.233 --> 30:42.033
-THIS WAS FUN.

30:42.033 --> 30:44.200
THAT WAS A LIE.
-LET'S EAT. I'M HUNGRY.

30:44.200 --> 30:46.833
HUNGRY PEOPLE,
HERE'S YOUR LUNCH.

30:46.833 --> 30:50.433
WELL, I'M SORRY, GUYS, I DIDN'T
GET YOU TO THE GRAND CANYON,

30:50.433 --> 30:51.700
BUT LOOK AT
THIS BACKGROUND.

30:51.700 --> 30:53.967
I MEAN, LOOK WHERE WE ARE.
-IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

30:53.967 --> 30:55.800
YOU GOT THE SOUNDS
AND THE VIEW.

30:55.800 --> 30:58.633
HONESTLY, I JUST FEEL LIKE
THIS IS SUCH A GOOD BREAK

30:58.633 --> 31:01.433
FROM EVERYTHING THAT'S BEEN
GOING ON IN OUR LIVES.

31:01.433 --> 31:05.633
WHITE-WATER RAFTING WAS A GOOD
DISTRACTION FROM THE SURGERY

31:05.633 --> 31:07.867
AND THE UPCOMING CONSULTATION,

31:07.867 --> 31:11.300
BUT NO MATTER HOW HARD
I TRY TO PUSH THIS FROM MY MIND,

31:11.300 --> 31:13.467
THIS IS JUST AN ISSUE
THAT IS SO IMPORTANT

31:13.467 --> 31:15.767
THAT IT'S GONNA COME UP
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

31:15.767 --> 31:18.600
I'M KIND OF SCARED TO HEAR
WHAT DR. TING IS GONNA SAY.

31:18.600 --> 31:21.467
THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO
IS THAT HE TELLS ME

31:21.467 --> 31:23.133
THAT I NEED
THE TISSUE EXPANDER

31:23.133 --> 31:24.667
AND THAT I'M NOT
A GOOD CANDIDATE

31:24.667 --> 31:27.233
FOR THE PERITONEAL
LINING PROCEDURE.

31:27.233 --> 31:30.800
AND HE SAYS,
"HERE'S THE O.R."

31:30.800 --> 31:33.900
AND HE SENDS ME RIGHT INTO
THE O.R. TO GET THE EXPANDER.

31:33.900 --> 31:36.833
-OPERATING ROOM.

31:36.833 --> 31:38.800
I DIDN'T HEAR
WHAT YOU JUST SAID.

31:38.800 --> 31:42.300
DR. BOWERS, WHEN WE WERE ON
THE FaceTime CALL WITH HER,

31:42.300 --> 31:44.867
SHE SAID, "I BOOKED AN O.R.
JUST IN CASE,"

31:44.867 --> 31:47.900
IN CASE HE WANTS TO STICK
AN EXPANDER IN HER.

31:47.900 --> 31:49.133
A TISSUE EXPANDER.

31:49.133 --> 31:50.133
I'M SORRY.
WHY DON'T YOU ELABORATE ON THAT?

31:50.133 --> 31:52.133
YOU --
-THAT'S ALL SHE SAID.

31:52.133 --> 31:53.767
YOU DIDN'T SHARE THAT
WITH ME THOUGH.

31:53.767 --> 31:55.067
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
-I THOUGHT I DID. SORRY.

31:55.067 --> 31:58.200
STARTING WHEN?

31:58.200 --> 31:59.367
WHEN?

31:59.367 --> 32:01.200
WHEN WE GO TO VISIT
DR. TING.

32:01.200 --> 32:02.300
-YEAH.

32:02.300 --> 32:03.867
WAIT. WHAT?

32:03.867 --> 32:05.767
YOU GOT TO TALK TO ME
ABOUT STUFF LIKE THIS.

32:05.767 --> 32:07.367
YOU DON'T JUST GO IN
AND HAVE SURGERY

32:07.367 --> 32:09.067
WITHOUT TALKING TO ME.
-WE DID NOT AGREE TO IT.

32:09.067 --> 32:11.967
SHE JUST SAID, "I BOOKED
AN O.R. JUST IN CASE."

32:11.967 --> 32:14.067
Jeanette: I AM NEVER PREPARED
TO TELL GREG SOMETHING

32:14.067 --> 32:15.233
THAT'S GONNA UPSET HIM

32:15.233 --> 32:17.600
'CAUSE I DON'T LIKE
TO UPSET GREG, SO NO.

32:17.600 --> 32:20.267
MAYBE THAT'S WHY
I SUBCONSCIOUSLY FORGOT.

32:20.267 --> 32:26.233
YOU AND I ARE GONNA
HAVE TO SPEAK.

32:26.233 --> 32:27.467
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU AND I HAVE TO SPEAK?

32:27.467 --> 32:28.767
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE.

32:28.767 --> 32:31.500
Greg: I'M REALLY BAFFLED WHY
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

32:31.500 --> 32:33.833
I'M HEARING ABOUT IT BECAUSE,

32:33.833 --> 32:36.333
TO HAVE THIS
TISSUE EXPANDER SURGERY,

32:36.333 --> 32:39.133
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I WOULD
EVEN BE REMOTELY OKAY WITH

32:39.133 --> 32:40.600
ON THIS TRIP TO NEW YORK.

32:40.600 --> 32:42.100
Jeanette: I GAVE YOU --

32:42.100 --> 32:44.333
THERE'S NO FURTHER DISCUSSION
UNTIL WE SPEAK TO DR. TING.

32:44.333 --> 32:47.367
SHE JUST SAID, "I BOOKED
AN O.R. JUST IN CASE."

32:47.367 --> 32:56.500
**

32:56.500 --> 33:05.700
**

33:05.700 --> 33:07.067
THANK YOU, MILADY.

33:07.067 --> 33:08.433
-YOU'RE WELCOME.
-HI.

33:08.433 --> 33:10.467
JAZZ HERE FOR DR. TING.

33:10.467 --> 33:13.300
Jazz: GOING INTO THIS
CONSULTATION WITH DR. TING,

33:13.300 --> 33:16.633
I AM SCARED THAT HE MAY
SAY SOMETHING BAD

33:16.633 --> 33:18.900
OR SUGGEST THAT I DO GET
THIS TISSUE EXPANDER.

33:18.900 --> 33:20.667
-THANKS SO MUCH.
-YOU'RE WELCOME.

33:20.667 --> 33:21.800
ANOTHER CONSULTATION.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.100
I FEEL LIKE
IT TAKES A WHOLE --

33:23.100 --> 33:24.567
-IT TAKES THE WHOLE UNIVERSE...

33:24.567 --> 33:25.733
-I DON'T THINK ANYBODY --
-...JUST TO GET MY PROCEDURE.

33:25.733 --> 33:26.900
NOBODY I KNOW HAS HAD
THIS MANY CONSULTS.

33:26.900 --> 33:28.433
WE'VE BEEN ACROSS
THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.

33:28.433 --> 33:29.933
YOU'RE A SPECIAL CASE.

33:29.933 --> 33:32.067
Greg: I'M HOPING THAT THIS
CONSULTATION WITH DR. TING

33:32.067 --> 33:34.200
IS THE LAST CONSULTATION
THAT WE HAVE.

33:34.200 --> 33:38.133
I HOPE TO ACHIEVE
SOME TYPE OF FINALITY.

33:38.133 --> 33:40.067
Jeanette: I THINK WE'RE ON
THE CUTTING EDGE

33:40.067 --> 33:42.800
OF THE MEDICINE
IN THIS AREA.

33:42.800 --> 33:45.400
Greg: I DON'T REALLY LIKE BEING
ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF ANYTHING.

33:47.667 --> 33:49.067
-HELLO.
-HI.

33:49.067 --> 33:50.167
-HELLO.

33:50.167 --> 33:51.533
HI.
HOW ARE YOU?

33:51.533 --> 33:52.600
GOOD.
I'M GREG.

33:52.600 --> 33:53.800
GREG, HI.
I'M DR. TING.

33:53.800 --> 33:55.267
-NICE TO MEET YOU.
-HI.

33:55.267 --> 33:56.300
JAZZ.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

33:56.300 --> 33:57.467
HI, JAZZ.
I LOVE YOUR HAIR.

33:57.467 --> 33:59.133
MY NAME IS DR. JESS TING.

33:59.133 --> 34:02.467
ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO,
I GAVE UP PLASTIC SURGERY

34:02.467 --> 34:05.067
TO FOCUS ON
TRANSGENDER SURGERY.

34:05.067 --> 34:06.067
SO,
JUST BRING ME UP TO SPEED.

34:06.067 --> 34:07.533
SO HOW OLD ARE YOU,
JAZZ?

34:07.533 --> 34:08.867
I'M 16.

34:08.867 --> 34:11.300
AND THEN, IN TERMS OF HORMONES
AND PUBERTY BLOCKERS,

34:11.300 --> 34:12.967
WHEN DID
ALL OF THAT START?

34:12.967 --> 34:17.067
I STARTED THE PUBERTY BLOCKERS
AT AGE 11

34:17.067 --> 34:20.367
AND HORMONES
WHEN I WAS 12.

34:20.367 --> 34:21.733
HAVE YOU WORKED
ON OTHER PATIENTS

34:21.733 --> 34:24.833
WHO HAVE BEEN BLOCKED
FROM SUCH AN EARLY AGE?

34:24.833 --> 34:27.267
YOU ARE THE EARLIEST.

34:27.267 --> 34:30.533
Dr. Ting:
I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT
JAZZ HAVING THIS OPERATION.

34:30.533 --> 34:34.400
SHE IS YOUNGER THAN ANYONE
WE'VE OPERATED ON SO FAR HERE,

34:34.400 --> 34:36.333
SO THIS IS A BIG STEP.

34:36.333 --> 34:39.233
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE
THE PATIENT IS PREPARED,

34:39.233 --> 34:41.100
UNDERSTANDS WHAT THEY'RE DOING,

34:41.100 --> 34:44.067
AND IS MAKING THE RIGHT
DECISION FOR THEMSELVES.

34:44.067 --> 34:45.233
BUT, I MEAN,
YOU'RE VERY FORTUNATE.

34:45.233 --> 34:46.867
YOUR VOICE HASN'T CHANGED.

34:46.867 --> 34:48.700
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU HAVEN'T
HAD ANY HAIR GROWTH.

34:48.700 --> 34:50.200
BUT THAT'S WHY WE'RE
IN THE POSITION NOW

34:50.200 --> 34:53.100
BECAUSE SHE'S GOT LESS
MATERIAL TO WORK WITH.

34:53.100 --> 34:56.433
THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM
THAT WE CAN'T OVERCOME.

34:56.433 --> 34:59.267
ONE OF THE THINGS WE CAN DO IS
WE CAN PUT IN A TISSUE EXPANDER,

34:59.267 --> 35:01.067
WHICH IS
A SKIN STRETCHER,

35:01.067 --> 35:04.167
AND WE CAN PUT THAT
IN THE SCROTUM.

35:04.167 --> 35:06.067
IT'S KIND OF LIKE
AN EMPTY BALLOON,

35:06.067 --> 35:10.133
AND YOU SLOWLY FILL IT UP
EVERY WEEK WITH JUST WATER.

35:10.133 --> 35:11.967
AS IT BLOWS UP,
IT STRETCHES THE SKIN,

35:11.967 --> 35:13.900
AND THAT CAN
CREATE NEW SKIN.

35:13.900 --> 35:17.900
IF YOU START THE PROCESS,
THEN WE FLY BACK TO FLORIDA,

35:17.900 --> 35:19.200
DO WE HAVE TO COME
BACK AND FORTH,

35:19.200 --> 35:20.633
OR IS THAT SOMETHING
THAT WE COULD DO --

35:20.633 --> 35:22.233
AS FAR AS
DOING IT YOURSELF,

35:22.233 --> 35:25.233
I MEAN,
HOW ARE YOU WITH NEEDLES?

35:25.233 --> 35:27.067
BECAUSE YOU JUST
HAVE TO FIND --

35:27.067 --> 35:28.567
THERE'S ONE PLACE
IN THE TISSUE EXPANDER

35:28.567 --> 35:31.067
YOU HAVE TO PUT A NEEDLE
THROUGH THE SKIN

35:31.067 --> 35:33.667
INTO THE EXPANDER
AND INJECT SALINE INTO IT.

35:33.667 --> 35:36.233
BUT THAT'S VERY PAINFUL
THOUGH, RIGHT?

35:36.233 --> 35:37.933
THAT'S VERY PAINFUL.

35:37.933 --> 35:40.100
THIS SOUNDS LIKE
MY WORST NIGHTMARE.

35:40.100 --> 35:44.133
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY, IF I NEED TO
DO IT TO GET THE OPERATION DONE,

35:44.133 --> 35:45.600
THEN I'M GONNA HAVE TO DO IT.

35:45.600 --> 35:49.167
HOWEVER, I'M REALLY HOPING THAT
I CAN AVOID THIS ALTOGETHER.

35:49.167 --> 35:50.767
HOW MUCH DOES THAT
AFFECT YOUR LIFE,

35:50.767 --> 35:52.700
LIKE, GOING TO SCHOOL
AND THINGS LIKE THAT?

35:52.700 --> 35:55.067
IN THE BEGINNING, IT'S OKAY.
IT'S NOT THAT BAD, BUT AS --

35:55.067 --> 35:56.467
ONCE IT GETS BIGGER.

35:56.467 --> 35:58.367
ONCE IT GETS BIGGER,
YOU'RE GONNA BE WALKING AROUND

35:58.367 --> 36:02.167
WITH, LIKE, THE WORLD'S
LARGEST SCROTUM.

36:02.167 --> 36:04.967
WE'RE TALKING, LIKE, YOU KNOW,
THE SIZE OF A GRAPEFRUIT.

36:04.967 --> 36:07.633
-OH, MY GOODNESS.
-IT'S REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE.

36:07.633 --> 36:09.133
Jeanette:
NO MATTER WHAT DR. TING SAYS,

36:09.133 --> 36:11.167
I AM NOT A FAN
OF THE TISSUE EXPANDER.

36:11.167 --> 36:12.933
IT MAKES YOU IMMOBILE,

36:12.933 --> 36:15.900
AND JAZZ'S DEPRESSION
IS STILL LOOMING.

36:15.900 --> 36:19.100
SO BESIDES THE TISSUE EXPANDER
BEING UNCOMFORTABLE,

36:19.100 --> 36:21.200
ARE THERE ANY
OTHER COMPLICATIONS

36:21.200 --> 36:22.633
THAT COULD HAPPEN
WITH THAT OR...?

36:22.633 --> 36:28.433
SO THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION,
AND THE ANSWER IS YES.

36:32.733 --> 36:35.233
SO BESIDES THE TISSUE EXPANDER
BEING UNCOMFORTABLE,

36:35.233 --> 36:37.233
ARE THERE ANY OTHER
COMPLICATIONS

36:37.233 --> 36:38.533
THAT COULD HAPPEN WITH THAT
OR...?

36:38.533 --> 36:41.433
SO THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION,
AND THE ANSWER IS YES.

36:41.433 --> 36:44.300
THE MOST COMMON COMPLICATIONS
FROM A TISSUE EXPANDER

36:44.300 --> 36:46.833
WOULD BE INFECTION,

36:46.833 --> 36:49.300
IN WHICH CASE THE EXPANDER
HAS TO BE REMOVED.

36:49.300 --> 36:53.100
THE OTHER PROBLEM IS THAT
THE SUTURE LINE CAN SPLIT OPEN.

36:53.100 --> 36:56.467
YOU CAN SEE THE IMPLANT
THROUGH THE SKIN.

36:56.467 --> 36:58.700
-YAY.
-RIGHT.

36:58.700 --> 37:01.267
THE MORE INFORMATION
THAT DR. TING REVEALS

37:01.267 --> 37:02.733
IN THIS CONSULTATION,

37:02.733 --> 37:05.633
THE MORE WORRIED I AM
ABOUT THIS EXAMINATION.

37:05.633 --> 37:08.267
I'M AFRAID THAT HE'S GONNA
TAKE ONE LOOK AT ME AND BE LIKE,

37:08.267 --> 37:11.600
"OKAY. YOU NEED TISSUE EXPANDER.
YOU NEED THIS. YOU NEED THAT."

37:11.600 --> 37:15.133
WOULD THERE BE ANY WAY TO, LIKE,
WORK AROUND THE TISSUE EXPANDER?

37:15.133 --> 37:17.067
WELL, I COULD EXAMINE YOU,
AND WE WOULD KNOW,

37:17.067 --> 37:19.133
BUT THERE ARE
OTHER OPTIONS.

37:19.133 --> 37:21.267
WE HAVE THE SKIN
ON THE OUTSIDE, RIGHT?

37:21.267 --> 37:23.400
BUT THERE'S ACTUALLY, LIKE,
A SECOND SKIN

37:23.400 --> 37:26.600
ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR BODY
CALLED PERITONEUM.

37:26.600 --> 37:31.067
PERITONEUM IS DIFFERENT
THAN SKIN IN SEVERAL KEY WAYS.

37:31.067 --> 37:32.367
IT'S HAIRLESS.

37:32.367 --> 37:33.533
IT'S PINK.

37:33.533 --> 37:34.833
IT'S ALSO SECRETORY.

37:34.833 --> 37:37.067
IT'S MOIST.
IT CREATES FLUID.

37:37.067 --> 37:40.233
IN A LOT OF WAYS, IT'S KIND
OF SIMILAR TO THE TISSUE

37:40.233 --> 37:43.800
THAT IS LINING
A CIS WOMAN'S VAGINA.

37:43.800 --> 37:46.233
IS THERE A LIMITATION
OF HOW MUCH PERITONEUM

37:46.233 --> 37:47.933
YOU HAVE AVAILABLE TO USE?

37:47.933 --> 37:50.067
-WE CAN GET A LOT.

37:50.067 --> 37:53.933
BUT THIS IS
EXPERIMENTAL.

37:53.933 --> 37:57.433
I'VE DONE IT IN
ABOUT 15 PATIENTS.

37:57.433 --> 38:00.833
Greg: I'M NOT KEEN ON THE USE
OF THE WORD EXPERIMENTAL.

38:00.833 --> 38:04.700
15 IS NOT THE GREATEST NUMBER,
AND I'M THINKING,

38:04.700 --> 38:07.233
"WHY COULDN'T
HE HAVE SAID 1,500?"

38:07.233 --> 38:08.667
I WOULD HAVE FELT
MUCH BETTER.

38:08.667 --> 38:10.767
OUT OF YOUR 15 PATIENTS,

38:10.767 --> 38:12.867
HAVE THE RESULTS
BEEN SUCCESSFUL?

38:12.867 --> 38:13.933
MIXED.

38:13.933 --> 38:16.467
WE'VE HAD SOME VERY
SUCCESSFUL ONES,

38:16.467 --> 38:19.400
A COUPLE THAT WERE
LESS SUCCESSFUL.

38:19.400 --> 38:21.567
LIKE WITH ANY KIND OF SURGERY,
THERE ARE PARTS OF IT

38:21.567 --> 38:24.967
THAT ARE JUST OUT
OF OUR CONTROL.

38:24.967 --> 38:30.233
ALL RIGHT. WELL, I GUESS
EXAMINATION, RIGHT?

38:30.233 --> 38:31.533
ALL RIGHT.
SHALL WE GO?

38:31.533 --> 38:32.733
-YEAH.
-OKAY.

38:32.733 --> 38:34.067
OKAY.

38:34.067 --> 38:36.067
Greg: THERE'S SO MUCH
INFORMATION THAT, YOU KNOW,

38:36.067 --> 38:38.067
WE HAVE TO DIGEST

38:38.067 --> 38:39.933
AND COME TO SOME
CONCLUSIONS ABOUT,

38:39.933 --> 38:42.200
BUT THE IDEA OF HAVING
TISSUE EXPANDERS

38:42.200 --> 38:45.400
IS A REALLY TOUGH
CONCEPT TO GRASP.

38:45.400 --> 38:48.100
I WANT TO HAVE JAZZ HAVE
THE LEAST DRASTIC METHOD

38:48.100 --> 38:50.633
OF OBTAINING
THE RESULTS SHE WANTS.

38:50.633 --> 38:52.667
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE WE WOULD
NEED TO SET ASIDE

38:52.667 --> 38:55.400
A MUCH GREATER AMOUNT
OF TIME FOR JAZZ

38:55.400 --> 38:57.667
TO BE ABLE TO HAVE
THAT PROCESS DONE

38:57.667 --> 39:00.467
AND THEN TO HAVE THE SURGERY
AND THEN TO RECOVER.

39:00.467 --> 39:02.467
Dr. Ting: OKAY, SO WE'RE JUST
GONNA DO A QUICK EXAM.

39:02.467 --> 39:04.333
IT SEEMS LIKE
A VERY DIFFICULT ROAD.

39:04.333 --> 39:07.600
SO THE VAGINA IS GONNA
GO RIGHT OVER HERE.

39:07.600 --> 39:10.100
Jazz: I'M HOPING THAT HE SAW
WHAT HE NEEDED TO,

39:10.100 --> 39:13.067
AND THAT HE CAN CONSTRUCT
THE BEST VAGINA POSSIBLE

39:13.067 --> 39:15.067
BASED ON MY MATERIALS.

39:15.067 --> 39:16.433
NOW, IF WE PUT
A TISSUE EXPANDER IN,

39:16.433 --> 39:18.067
THAT'S GONNA GO
RIGHT OVER HERE.

39:18.067 --> 39:21.067
I'M VERY NERVOUS BECAUSE
THE TISSUE EXPANDER

39:21.067 --> 39:22.367
AFFECTS ME PHYSICALLY.

39:22.367 --> 39:24.767
IT WOULD PREVENT ME
FROM BEING ABLE TO WALK

39:24.767 --> 39:26.400
AND ENGAGE IN
PHYSICAL ACTIVITY,

39:26.400 --> 39:29.067
AND I NEED TO DO THAT
TO LOSE THIS WEIGHT.

39:29.067 --> 39:31.533
OKAY.
SO WE'LL SEE YOU UPSTAIRS, OKAY?

39:31.533 --> 39:33.333
AND I HAVE TO
LOSE THIS WEIGHT,

39:33.333 --> 39:35.533
OR THERE WILL BE NO OTHER
ISSUES TO DEAL WITH AT ALL

39:35.533 --> 39:37.433
'CAUSE I WON'T BE GETTING
THE PROCEDURE DONE.

39:37.433 --> 39:40.867
OKAY.

39:40.867 --> 39:42.633
AFTER EXAMINING YOU,

39:42.633 --> 39:45.533
AS FAR AS A TISSUE EXPANDER
IS CONCERNED...

39:45.533 --> 39:46.667
MM-HMM.

39:51.567 --> 39:53.067
SPIT IT OUT, AND TELL ME

39:53.067 --> 39:55.167
IF I NEED THIS TISSUE
EXPANDER OR NOT.

39:55.167 --> 39:56.933
YOU JUST...
