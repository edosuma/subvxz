Oh, sorry. I guess
we're just nervous.

birthday present yet?

Let me guess, Alex,
you forgot.

01:49.680 --> 01:51.200
two days ago.

extra money, Alex.

Wow, ten bucks.

02:11.720 --> 02:13.280
18 months with my powers

02:13.280 --> 02:15.120
and I'm not any more popular

02:15.120 --> 02:16.920
my grades are still average

02:16.920 --> 02:19.280
and my dad still
sometimes treats me

02:19.280 --> 02:20.800
like I'm that other kid

02:20.800 --> 02:22.520
that lives in
Annie's room.

02:22.520 --> 02:24.600
Nobody knows
what you can do, Alex.

02:24.600 --> 02:26.880
If they did you'd be
the most popular

02:26.880 --> 02:28.520
eighth-grader
in the world.

02:28.520 --> 02:30.680
And I'd be your
famous best friend.

02:30.680 --> 02:33.440
If they knew,
I'd be locked up at the Plant

02:33.440 --> 02:35.520
with wires and tubes
stuck to me.

Wasn't Annie supposed
to find a safe way

02:38.240 --> 02:40.040

to expose Danielle?

02:40.040 --> 02:41.960
That's exactly
my point, Ray.

02:41.960 --> 02:44.400
Annie's going to
find a way, not me.

<i>That child shouldn't have been
running loose for 18 hours!</i>

02:58.520 --> 03:01.760
If I'd been able
to experiment on that kid

03:01.760 --> 03:04.120
I'd have a nobel prize by now.

03:04.120 --> 03:08.200
I'd have a trillion-dollar
patent by now!

03:09.520 --> 03:11.440
I'd be running
for governor

03:11.440 --> 03:13.800

But instead

what have I got?

03:17.120 --> 03:18.800
An ulcer!

03:18.800 --> 03:22.800
And I love spicy food.

03:22.800 --> 03:26.280
Just give me a little bit
more time, Miss Atron.

03:26.280 --> 03:28.360

Oh, of course.

Uh, shall we
get started?

03:53.960 --> 03:56.000
Mm-hmm. We can
go in here.

04:04.200 --> 04:06.000
Oh, I should've
made it clear.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.520
All candidate interviews

04:12.000 --> 04:13.160
Um, okay, sure.

04:13.160 --> 04:15.360
You can hang out
in the garage with Alex.

04:15.360 --> 04:18.200
I told her to wait there
until it was over.

04:18.200 --> 04:20.360
We'll be about an hour.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.640

Thanks for lending me
your allowance, Ray.

Now I can afford
to buy

04:44.040 --> 04:46.360
So, I'll get this back

Right, like next week

All right, next week,

I should have just
enough time to get there

05:20.840 --> 05:22.440
You know I can't drive.

05:22.440 --> 05:24.680

about driving?

Just roll it.

Uh-uh. No way.

Who's interviewing Annie.

05:31.600 --> 05:34.080
Come on, Alex,
he won't even notice it.

05:34.080 --> 05:36.520
Just use your powers
and roll it back.

05:36.520 --> 05:37.640
It'll be a snap.

05:39.120 --> 05:40.480

Okay.

Yes!

All right, ready?

05:51.160 --> 05:52.680
This independent
research project

05:52.680 --> 05:53.880
is impressive,
Miss Mack.

05:53.880 --> 05:55.360
How long have you
worked on it?

05:55.360 --> 05:56.440
18 months.

05:56.440 --> 05:58.240
And you say
it's secret research?

05:58.240 --> 05:59.240
Yes, for now.

05:59.240 --> 06:00.880
I hope to complete
the project

06:00.880 --> 06:02.680
and then make
the results public

06:02.680 --> 06:03.800
once I'm at M.I.T.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.720
Well, based on your
academic record

enough, Alex

an explanation!

I was trying
to get my bike out

07:00.040 --> 07:01.080
to get Mom's present.

07:01.080 --> 07:02.200
So I pushed his car--

If you needed
the car moved

07:03.840 --> 07:05.640
why didn't you
just ask him?

07:05.640 --> 07:07.480
You were in
mid-interview.

07:07.480 --> 07:08.920
Which you ruined anyway.

Do you think I'll get accepted
after this?!

10:39.360 --> 10:40.680
I'm Alexandra Mack.

10:40.680 --> 10:43.080
I'm supposed to be in
Miss Elkin's Algebra class.

10:43.080 --> 10:45.200
You're making it harder
on yourself, miss.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.680
The record shows no
Alexandra Mack in this school

10:47.680 --> 10:49.880
or in Paradise Valley,
either.

10:49.880 --> 10:51.320
There must be a mistake.

My parents are
George and Barbara Mack.

10:55.160 --> 10:57.680
There's a mistake,
all right, young lady

10:57.680 --> 10:58.960

This is the assistant

11:36.440 --> 11:38.800
to Principal Cunningham
at Atron Junior High.

11:38.800 --> 11:40.360
We had a girl at school today

insisting she was your daughter,
Alexandra.

please call us.

11:53.320 --> 11:55.320
What's going on?!

Vince?

12:28.200 --> 12:30.000
Do you know
what today is?

12:30.000 --> 12:32.600
Ah, an anniversary, is it not?

12:32.600 --> 12:33.760
Yes.

12:33.760 --> 12:35.760
Today it's been
exactly 18 months

12:35.760 --> 12:39.000
since we began testing GC-161
on our human subject

12:39.000 --> 12:42.480
and I'm happy to report that
the chairman of the board

12:42.480 --> 12:44.760
is coming today
for a demonstration.

12:44.760 --> 12:48.400
Well, now, that is
excellent news, Miss Atron

12:48.400 --> 12:50.680
and we are more than ready.

12:50.680 --> 12:53.120
I can't wait to see
the chairman's face

12:53.120 --> 12:55.440
when he realizes
what GC-161 can do!

12:55.440 --> 12:58.240
All my dreams are about
to come true, Vince.

12:58.240 --> 12:59.920
Once I'm elected
governor

12:59.920 --> 13:02.040
I'll push to make sure
that GC-161

13:02.040 --> 13:04.680
is approved for sale
in the United States

13:04.680 --> 13:06.320
and we'll make a fortune!

13:06.320 --> 13:08.520
Then... it's on to
the white house.

13:08.520 --> 13:10.560
And I have you to thank, Vince.

13:10.560 --> 13:13.520
Your outstanding job
in plant security

13:13.520 --> 13:16.200
has made sure
that nobody found out

13:16.200 --> 13:18.120
about our human testing.

13:18.120 --> 13:21.320
The tricky part was
keeping George Mack away.

13:21.320 --> 13:24.360
But the kid that lives
next door to him

13:24.360 --> 13:26.160
is keeping an eye on him for me.

13:26.160 --> 13:29.160
Just make sure that
nothing goes wrong today.

13:29.160 --> 13:30.920
We're this close, Vince.

13:30.920 --> 13:33.880
You can count on me, Miss Atron.

13:35.240 --> 13:38.360
I am so sorry that I'm late,
Dr. Matsumura.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.720
Well, let's get started,
shall we?

13:46.800 --> 13:50.680
I'm concerned about your
academic record, Miss Mack.

13:50.680 --> 13:54.360
Your grades have fallen badly
in the last three semesters.

13:54.360 --> 13:55.800
I can explain that.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.400
A year and a half ago

13:57.400 --> 14:01.400
my mother disappeared
under mysterious circumstances.

14:01.400 --> 14:04.280
I had to take a job
after school.

14:04.280 --> 14:06.760
You'll need a scholarship
for college?

14:06.760 --> 14:08.880
Yes, money's
very tight now.

14:08.880 --> 14:11.160
My father got demoted
at his job and...

14:11.160 --> 14:13.280
I'm sorry.
But I can only

14:13.280 --> 14:14.880
offer scholarships

14:14.880 --> 14:16.880
to the most
qualified applicants.

14:16.880 --> 14:19.240
Perhaps you should apply

14:19.240 --> 14:21.200
to less competitive
colleges.

14:24.360 --> 14:26.760
Mom disappeared?

14:27.640 --> 14:29.880
A year and a half ago?

14:36.800 --> 14:37.960

Ah.

14:53.200 --> 14:56.040
So this is going to be
a private tour.

14:56.040 --> 14:58.200
Hmm... in fact

14:58.200 --> 15:01.640
one person is more
than I usually get.

15:01.640 --> 15:04.080
Well, let's begin, shall we?

15:07.000 --> 15:10.320
Paradise Valley Chemical
Plant's here to help mankind.

15:10.320 --> 15:13.680
Over 197 environmentally
safe products are made here.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.200
Pretty impressive, huh?

15:15.200 --> 15:17.360
What's in there?

15:17.360 --> 15:18.600
That's the vacu-zone.

15:18.600 --> 15:20.920
That's where they
work on the Chemical

15:20.920 --> 15:22.920
that's going
to change the world.

15:22.920 --> 15:24.240
Can I see it?

15:24.240 --> 15:26.560
Sorry, even I'm
not allowed in there.

15:26.560 --> 15:27.800
Let's go.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.920
Hey, Mr. Mack,
how's it going?

15:41.920 --> 15:43.000
Fine, Ray.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.280
Today's shipment

15:44.280 --> 15:45.800

safe products

15:45.800 --> 15:47.400

15:47.400 --> 15:48.400
Good, good.

15:48.400 --> 15:49.880
This is
Alex MacKenzie.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.800
I'm giving her
a tour today.

15:51.800 --> 15:52.920
Alex?

15:52.920 --> 15:54.480
That's a great name.

15:54.480 --> 15:56.400
If I'd had another daughter

15:56.400 --> 15:58.200
I would have named her Alex.

15:58.200 --> 16:00.400
Didn't you use to be
a scientist?

16:00.400 --> 16:03.160
Yes, Alex,
I was head researcher

16:03.160 --> 16:06.440
for a special chemical
called GC-161.

16:08.120 --> 16:10.560
But Danielle Atron
canceled the project

16:10.560 --> 16:13.920
and this was the only job left
at the Plant for me.

16:13.920 --> 16:15.960
It's time for us
to move on.

16:15.960 --> 16:18.200
Nice to see you
again, Mr. Mack.

16:18.200 --> 16:21.160
And remember, keep
those packages moving.

16:21.160 --> 16:22.680
You got it, Ray.

16:22.680 --> 16:24.600
Good-bye, Alex.

16:24.600 --> 16:25.600
Bye.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.680
<i>( Coughing )</i>

16:33.560 --> 16:34.600
The real truth is

16:34.600 --> 16:37.000
they didn't cancel
the GC-161 project.

16:37.000 --> 16:39.960
Mack was fired because
he was a security risk.

16:39.960 --> 16:41.640
What happened
to his wife?

16:41.640 --> 16:43.160
Huh, really sad.

16:43.160 --> 16:45.160
I hear she ran
away from home

16:45.160 --> 16:47.360
and went to Tahiti
or something.

16:47.360 --> 16:49.000
How do you know
all this?

16:49.000 --> 16:50.200
I know everything.

16:50.200 --> 16:51.960
I'm best friends
with Vince

16:51.960 --> 16:53.640
head of plant security.

16:57.800 --> 17:00.120
Excellent work, Vince!

17:00.120 --> 17:02.240
The chairman was
extremely pleased.

17:02.240 --> 17:04.520
So, he'll take
our subject to Europe?

17:04.520 --> 17:05.839
Yes, it'll be
easier

17:05.839 --> 17:07.359
to keep her
hidden away.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.720
My only regret is
that I'll be losing

17:09.720 --> 17:12.200
all that free public
relations advice.

17:12.200 --> 17:14.640

17:24.599 --> 17:28.079
How come you don't have
any friends your own age?

17:28.079 --> 17:29.240
Well, growing up

17:29.240 --> 17:33.080
I didn't have anyone
my age to play with.

17:33.080 --> 17:35.560
Do you have
a best friend?

17:35.560 --> 17:36.720
Um, I did.

17:36.720 --> 17:39.800
You know, where I come from.

17:39.800 --> 17:42.240
Must have been nice.

18:39.840 --> 18:41.240
Tell me, please.

18:41.240 --> 18:43.120
I'm here to help you.

18:43.120 --> 18:48.760
I was driving to pick up
my daughter at school one day

18:48.760 --> 18:51.600
and suddenly a truck
slammed into me

18:51.600 --> 18:55.560
and spilled a kind of a chemical
all over everything.

18:55.560 --> 18:59.000
And then... the next thing
I remember

18:59.000 --> 19:02.600
Mr. Carter and Miss Atron
locked me in here

19:02.600 --> 19:05.000
and I've been here ever since.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.520
You got in that accident

19:06.520 --> 19:09.240
because I wasn't there
to run into the truck first.

19:09.240 --> 19:11.080
What are you talking about?

19:11.080 --> 19:13.040
I don't have time
to explain.

19:13.040 --> 19:15.800
Come on, we have
to get you out of here.

19:15.800 --> 19:17.280
Here, morph into this

and I'll sneak you out
under my sweater.

What's a morph?

19:26.040 --> 19:27.560

Barbara Mack.

Hear, hear.

19:31.480 --> 19:33.200
My security card
was stolen!

19:33.200 --> 19:36.000
And there's an intruder
loose in the Plant!

19:36.000 --> 19:39.080
Someone could be here
to free the test subject.

19:39.080 --> 19:42.000
And I thought she was
going to be my friend.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.280

goes free

Since our primary testing
subject is off to Europe

21:36.480 --> 21:38.160
I'm afraid the only way

we can continue
our research here
