It's been so long
since I've had a pair
of tits in my hands,

00:16.133 --> 00:19.366
I popped a lap rocket
opening up a can of tuna
last Sunday morning.

00:19.400 --> 00:20.633
Oh, that's off‐putting.

00:20.666 --> 00:22.400
Not to old Gail,
it isn't.

big bang theory, Daniel.

00:24.600 --> 00:26.566

just be out there

to a bit of toe curlin'

College and university kids
will be home for the summer
next week.

00:48.666 --> 00:50.433
Well, that should
help your spring fever.

00:58.066 --> 01:00.500
Go easy down there,
Squirrely Dan.

01:00.533 --> 01:03.066
I suffered severely
from the spring fever
last year,

01:03.100 --> 01:06.166
had to go into
full cougar mode
with an 18‐year‐old.

01:06.200 --> 01:08.166
Oh?
May have been
my second cousin.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.500
Oh.

01:09.533 --> 01:11.166
It was either that
or be at home flickin' it

01:14.066 --> 01:15.333
You know they're all
gonna be in here lookin'

01:15.366 --> 01:17.566

"How's your father?"

01:17.600 --> 01:19.466

is tight or you'll
be home firing wristers.

01:34.466 --> 01:36.300
Here's a tip.

01:36.333 --> 01:39.433
When the gettin's good
around here, stay close
to your pal Wayne.

than a hotel room
hand towel.

01:42.433 --> 01:44.700
Well, here's a tip.
Don't fart in a spacesuit.

01:44.733 --> 01:47.200
Here's a tip.
Don't sneeze when
you're taking a piss.

01:47.233 --> 01:49.533
Here's a tip.
It's really hard to get tuna
out of your dick hole.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.700
This place is about to be
crawling with snapper.

01:55.733 --> 01:57.366
Let's hope
this is the last night

01:57.400 --> 01:59.633

Why don't you guys
wear belts?

03:48.833 --> 03:50.800
'Cause we buy pants

09:40.065 --> 09:40.898
Ooh.

09:44.532 --> 09:46.365
Scored a perfect score
in the bonus round.

09:46.398 --> 09:47.432
Don't think I've ever
seen that before.

09:47.465 --> 09:49.532
Remember what happened
here today.

09:49.565 --> 09:50.865
You can't forget
something like that.

09:50.898 --> 09:52.965
Seen Angie in here
with her new boyfriend
again a couple nights ago.

09:52.998 --> 09:55.798
Oh, who gives a care.

09:55.832 --> 09:57.632
Remember I told you
he was in a '94 Jeep YJ with
a wave decal on the side?

09:57.665 --> 09:59.498
He made an upgrade.
Short trip.

09:59.532 --> 10:02.465
Pulled in here with a 2003
aquamarine Audi wagon

10:02.498 --> 10:04.598
with a magenta "Fear this"
sticker on the back.

10:04.632 --> 10:06.732
Ain't no reason
to get excited.

10:06.765 --> 10:09.632
Came in here wearing
a pair of Fandango
pink pastel khakis

10:09.665 --> 10:11.865
with a white, gold
leather chain
fuckin' wallet,

10:11.898 --> 10:13.032
and a Creed T‐shirt on.

10:13.065 --> 10:15.432
Remarkable.
I know.

10:15.465 --> 10:18.398
He had a deep carrot
orange fedora with
a burnt orange stripe

10:18.432 --> 10:20.598
and a little cauliflower
blue feather

10:20.632 --> 10:21.732
with a fucking,
I don't know,

10:21.765 --> 10:23.432
looked like to me
some kind of

10:23.465 --> 10:24.998
a black‐bearded titmouse
or some kind of shit.

10:25.032 --> 10:27.698
Did you know
there's a type of bird
called a Bushtit?

10:27.732 --> 10:29.365
I did not.
It's a type
of chickadee.

10:29.398 --> 10:30.765
He also had
an imperial purple...

10:30.798 --> 10:32.332
That'll do, McMurray.

10:32.365 --> 10:33.965
Oh, I'm just sayin'
it must suck balls

10:33.998 --> 10:35.498
to lose to a fucking
douchebag like that.

10:37.465 --> 10:38.765
Hi.

10:38.798 --> 10:41.265
Heard you doin' all right
at Buck Hunter.

10:41.298 --> 10:42.332
What say I give you
a quick squeezer in
the parking lot there, eh?

10:44.032 --> 10:45.232
Could be worse.

10:45.732 --> 10:46.732
Could indeed.

10:48.398 --> 10:49.465
There a vet around
here, ladies?

10:49.498 --> 10:50.465
These puppies are sick.

10:55.465 --> 10:59.265
Christ, I would
snort her dandruff.

10:59.298 --> 11:02.932
DARYL: Dandruff is a fungus.
I think you mean you'd
sniff her flakes.

11:02.965 --> 11:04.998
Then you are giving me
far too much credit, my boy.

11:09.498 --> 11:10.965
(LOUDLY) Oh, oh.

11:10.998 --> 11:14.032
Lookin' some comely
tonight there, big fella.

11:14.065 --> 11:15.965
Do you wanna know
what, Gail?

11:15.998 --> 11:18.532
I think you've got a case
of the spring fever.

11:18.565 --> 11:19.698
Can I get you a drink?

11:19.732 --> 11:20.532
Okay.

11:21.798 --> 11:23.432
You see that one?

11:23.465 --> 11:25.465
She's like a Middle Eastern
rebel army.

11:25.498 --> 11:27.598
'Cause there's a political
uprising in my pants.

11:27.632 --> 11:29.532
Well, shoulders back.
Here she comes.

11:30.765 --> 11:31.765
Excuse me, boys.

11:36.665 --> 11:38.298
She's sweet on you.
Get after it.

11:38.332 --> 11:39.465
You think so?

11:39.498 --> 11:40.632
You see what she
just did?

11:40.665 --> 11:42.465
Touched your back
and then, moved on?

11:42.498 --> 11:44.632
That's called the
unnecessary squeeze‐by.

11:44.665 --> 11:45.965
Is that what
it's called?
Mmm‐hmm.

11:45.998 --> 11:49.265
You noticed she had about
half a fuckin' soccer field
to get past

11:49.298 --> 11:51.498
but instead leaned in close,
got a bit handsy

11:51.532 --> 11:52.898
like there was only
a tiny lane to get by?

11:54.032 --> 11:55.865
The unnecessary
squeeze‐by.

11:55.898 --> 11:57.965
Go talk to her.

11:57.998 --> 12:00.265
Let's fire back
a couple of shots first.

12:00.298 --> 12:03.332
Well, this is
swiftly becoming
a counterproductive practice,

12:03.365 --> 12:04.732
but okay.

12:09.532 --> 12:12.032
Look at Coopsy
out there.

sweet on a dude

Instead of tilting
her neck up
to look at him,

she'll just keep her head
straight and look up
with her eyes.

For the boys.

18:55.284 --> 18:56.617
KATY: Yeah, no,
I heard you.

18:58.251 --> 19:00.517
I heard you say
that I'm a distraction.

19:00.551 --> 19:02.484
Okay.

19:02.517 --> 19:03.984
Well, guess I'll have to
find one of your teammates

19:04.017 --> 19:05.184
to dibs my digits.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.617
BOTH: But we dibs'd
those digis!

19:16.151 --> 19:18.917
You did a decent job
with these d‐gens tonight.

19:18.951 --> 19:19.951
Thank you, Gail.

19:20.651 --> 19:21.851
I said decent.

19:21.884 --> 19:24.117
You forgot the
most important thing.

19:24.151 --> 19:27.484
Don't get so drunk you
couldn't use it even
if you had the option.

19:27.517 --> 19:29.851
Mmm‐hmm.

19:29.884 --> 19:32.217
I'll tell you what
and I'll only tell you once.

19:32.251 --> 19:34.051
You've got the pick
of the litter around here

19:34.084 --> 19:35.584
so you may as well
get pickin'.

19:39.751 --> 19:42.184
I've got this fifty bucks
and no one to claim it.

19:42.217 --> 19:43.451
What say we put it
in your jeans

19:43.484 --> 19:46.584
and see what else is
hangin' around in there
while we're at it?

19:46.617 --> 19:48.151
No.

19:48.184 --> 19:51.251
Like what's in your jeans,
big fella?
Nothin'...

19:51.284 --> 19:54.017
I mean it. Cripes,
I may not go down
in history,

19:54.051 --> 19:55.751
but I'll go down on you.

19:55.784 --> 19:59.551
Okay.
(CHUCKLING)
You want to do 68?

19:59.584 --> 20:01.684
I'll help you clean up.
You'll go down on me?

20:01.717 --> 20:03.517
And I'll owe you one.

20:03.551 --> 20:05.584
Where's that rag?
There it is.

20:05.617 --> 20:08.217
Wake up, big shoots
and really big shoots.

20:08.251 --> 20:09.851
More hands
make less work.

20:09.884 --> 20:11.184
Call me cake!

20:11.217 --> 20:13.217
'Cause I go straight
to your ass, cowboy.

20:17.784 --> 20:18.784
There's cake?

20:20.051 --> 20:21.051
No.
