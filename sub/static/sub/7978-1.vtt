00:49.108 --> 00:51.224
Your Highness...

00:53.188 --> 00:56.863
There was a time, not very long ago,

00:56.948 --> 01:00.065
when we lived in an enchanted world

01:00.148 --> 01:05.461
of elegant palaces and grand parties.

01:05.868 --> 01:09.747
The year was 1916

01:10.588 --> 01:12.977
and my son Nicholas

01:13.668 --> 01:16.819
was the Czar of lmperial Russia.

01:27.508 --> 01:29.021
Hello, darling.

01:29.108 --> 01:35.456
We were celebrating the 300th anniversary
of our family's rule.

01:36.028 --> 01:43.537
And, that night, no star burned brighter
than that of our sweet Anastasia,

01:43.628 --> 01:45.983
my youngest granddaughter.

01:47.668 --> 01:51.138
She begged me not to return to Paris,

01:51.228 --> 01:57.781
so I had a very special gift made for her
to make the separation easier for both of us.

01:58.988 --> 02:01.502
For me? Is it ajewellery box?

02:02.348 --> 02:04.908
Dimitri. You belong in the kitchen.

02:06.268 --> 02:08.258
Look.

02:10.428 --> 02:12.225
It plays our lullaby.

02:12.308 --> 02:15.061
You can play it at night
before you go to sleep

02:15.148 --> 02:17.537
and pretend that it's me singing.

02:21.268 --> 02:23.463
On the wind

02:23.548 --> 02:25.857
'Cross the sea

02:25.948 --> 02:30.863
Hear this song and remember

02:31.628 --> 02:36.144
Soon you'll be home with me

02:36.708 --> 02:41.782
Once upon a December

02:43.828 --> 02:45.819
Read what it says.

02:45.908 --> 02:48.342
"Together in Paris."

02:49.708 --> 02:51.903
Really? Oh, Grandmamma.

02:54.668 --> 02:58.502
But we would never be together in Paris,

02:58.588 --> 03:04.584
for a dark shadow had descended
upon the house of the Romanovs.

03:05.548 --> 03:08.301
His name was Rasputin.

03:08.988 --> 03:12.947
We thought he was a holy man,
but he was a fraud,

03:13.028 --> 03:15.383
power-mad and dangerous.

03:15.468 --> 03:17.584
How dare you return to the palace?

03:17.668 --> 03:19.738
But I am your confidant.

03:19.828 --> 03:21.341
Confidant? Hah!

03:21.428 --> 03:23.703
You are a traitor. Get out!

03:23.788 --> 03:27.019
You think you can banish the great Rasputin?

03:27.108 --> 03:33.547
By the unholy powers vested in me,
I banish you with a curse.

03:34.868 --> 03:36.859
Mark my words.

03:36.948 --> 03:41.499
You and your family will die
within the fortnight.

03:42.548 --> 03:48.544
I will not rest until I see the end
of the Romanov line for ever!

03:56.068 --> 03:59.981
Consumed by his hatred
for Nicholas and his family,

04:00.068 --> 04:04.459
Rasputin sold his soul
for the power to destroy them.

04:10.468 --> 04:12.220
Go.

04:12.308 --> 04:15.345
Fulfil your dark purpose

04:16.067 --> 04:21.017
and seal the fate of the Czar and his family

04:21.108 --> 04:23.303
once and for all.

04:24.388 --> 04:28.779
From that moment on,
the spark of unhappiness in our country

04:28.868 --> 04:34.386
was fanned into a flame
that would soon destroy our lives for ever.

04:37.468 --> 04:39.345
- Help!
- Hurry, children.

04:39.428 --> 04:41.783
- My music box.
- Anastasia!

04:42.468 --> 04:44.459
Come back! Come back!

04:47.228 --> 04:49.219
Anastasia...

04:54.348 --> 04:57.784
- Please, hurry.
- Come this way. Out the servants' quarters.

04:59.108 --> 05:02.100
- Hurry, Anastasia.
- Rasputin, she's getting away.

05:02.188 --> 05:03.860
- My music box.
- Go! Go!

05:03.948 --> 05:06.382
Comrades, in here!

05:06.468 --> 05:09.028
Where are they, boy?

05:12.948 --> 05:15.337
- Grandmamma...
- Keep up with me, darling.

05:18.748 --> 05:21.262
- Rasputin!
- Let me go. Please!

05:21.348 --> 05:25.421
You'll never escape me, child. Never!

05:30.988 --> 05:33.024
Bartok!

05:33.108 --> 05:34.382
Master!

05:41.628 --> 05:44.586
Anastasia, hurry. Hurry.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.101
- Grandmamma!
- Here, take my hand.

05:51.588 --> 05:54.261
- Hold onto my hand.
- Don't let go!

05:56.388 --> 05:57.537
Anastasia.

05:59.188 --> 06:01.224
Anastasia!

06:06.388 --> 06:10.017
So many lives were destroyed that night.

06:11.188 --> 06:14.783
What had always been
was now gone for ever.

06:16.388 --> 06:20.142
And my Anastasia, my beloved grandchild,

06:21.388 --> 06:23.743
I never saw her again.

06:56.188 --> 06:58.019
Saint Petersburg is gloomy

06:58.108 --> 06:59.666
Saint Petersburg is bleak

06:59.748 --> 07:03.661
My underwear got frozen
standing here all week

07:03.748 --> 07:07.104
Since the Revolution
our lives have been so grey

07:07.188 --> 07:10.339
Thank goodness for the gossip
that gets us through the day

07:11.068 --> 07:14.697
Have you heard
there's a rumour in Saint Petersburg?

07:14.788 --> 07:17.586
Have you heard
what they're saying on the street?

07:18.228 --> 07:21.857
Although the Czar did not survive,
one daughter may be still alive

07:22.748 --> 07:25.421
The Princess Anastasia

07:25.508 --> 07:26.941
But please do not repeat

07:27.028 --> 07:30.543
It's a rumour, a legend, a mystery

07:30.628 --> 07:34.223
Something whispered in an alleyway
or through a crack

07:34.308 --> 07:38.062
It's a rumour that's part of our history

07:38.148 --> 07:41.504
They say her royal grandmamma
will pay a royal sum

07:41.588 --> 07:45.501
To someone who can bring the princess back

07:48.268 --> 07:50.259
- Vlad!
- Dimitri.

07:52.788 --> 07:54.460
A rouble for this painting

07:54.548 --> 07:56.504
It's Romanov, I swear

07:56.588 --> 08:00.422
Count Yusupov's pyjamas -
comrades, buy the pair

08:00.508 --> 08:03.705
I got this from the palace,
it's lined with real fur

08:03.788 --> 08:07.497
It could be worth a fortune
if it belonged to her

08:10.668 --> 08:12.738
Well, Dimitri, I got us a theatre.

08:12.828 --> 08:16.104
Everything's going according to plan.
All we need is the girl.

08:16.188 --> 08:19.578
Just think, Vlad, no more forging papers,
no more stolen goods.

08:19.668 --> 08:24.947
We'll have three tickets out of here: One
for you, one for me and one for Anastasia.

08:26.028 --> 08:29.338
It's the rumour, the legend, the mystery

08:29.428 --> 08:33.023
It's the Princess Anastasia
who will help us fly

08:33.107 --> 08:36.942
You and I, friend, will go down in history

08:37.548 --> 08:40.664
We'll find a girl to play the part
and teach her what to say

08:41.107 --> 08:44.703
Dress her up and take her to Paree

08:44.788 --> 08:48.781
lmagine the reward
her dear old grandmamma will pay

08:48.868 --> 08:52.019
Who else could pull it off but you and me?

08:52.108 --> 08:53.826
- We'll be rich
- We'll be rich

08:53.908 --> 08:55.899
- We'll be out
- We'll be out

08:55.988 --> 09:00.300
And Saint Petersburg
will have some more to talk about

09:04.308 --> 09:07.505
Have you heard
there's a rumour in Saint Petersburg?

09:07.588 --> 09:10.705
Have you heard
what they're saying on the street?

09:17.828 --> 09:21.377
Have you heard
there's a rumour in Saint Petersburg?

09:21.468 --> 09:24.540
Have you heard?
Comrades, what do you suppose?

09:24.668 --> 09:28.741
- A fascinating mystery
- The biggest con in history

09:28.828 --> 09:35.779
The Princess Anastasia

09:35.868 --> 09:38.985
Alive or dead?

09:39.548 --> 09:41.539
Who knows? Sh!

09:50.468 --> 09:53.426
I got you ajob in the fish factory.

09:53.508 --> 09:57.467
You go down this path till you get to
the fork in the road. Go left...

09:57.548 --> 09:58.264
Bye!

09:58.348 --> 10:00.623
- Are you listening?
- Bye, everybody!

10:00.708 --> 10:03.461
I'm listening, Comrade Phlegmenkoff.

10:03.548 --> 10:07.461
You've been a thorn in my side
since you were brought here.

10:07.548 --> 10:12.576
Acting like the Queen of Sheba
instead of the nameless no-account you are.

10:12.988 --> 10:17.106
For the last ten years, I've fed you,
I've clothed you, I've...

10:17.188 --> 10:19.179
Kept a roof over my head.

10:20.588 --> 10:25.298
How is it you don't have a clue
who you were before you came to us,

10:25.388 --> 10:27.185
but you can remember all that?

10:27.268 --> 10:30.260
- I do have a clue to...
- Ach! I know.

10:30.348 --> 10:32.816
"Together in Paris."

10:32.908 --> 10:37.379
So, you want to go to France
to find your family?

10:40.388 --> 10:43.380
Little Miss Anya,
it's time to take your place in life.

10:43.468 --> 10:45.459
In life and in line.

10:45.548 --> 10:47.425
And be grateful, too.

10:48.228 --> 10:50.219
"Together in Paris"!

10:54.748 --> 10:56.739
Be grateful.

10:59.308 --> 11:01.742
"Be grateful, Anya."

11:01.828 --> 11:04.820
I am grateful. Grateful to get away!

11:06.068 --> 11:08.787
"Go left" she says.

11:08.868 --> 11:13.658
Well, I know what's to the left.
I'll be "Anya the orphan" for ever.

11:15.068 --> 11:18.265
But if I go right, maybe I could find...

11:19.948 --> 11:22.667
Whoever gave me this necklace
must have loved me.

11:25.308 --> 11:28.061
This is crazy. Me? Go to Paris?

11:30.868 --> 11:32.859
Send me a sign!

11:33.708 --> 11:35.585
A hint!

11:36.028 --> 11:38.019
Anything!

11:43.708 --> 11:47.542
I don't have time to play right now, OK?
I'm waiting for a sign.

11:50.828 --> 11:53.979
Would you please leave me alone?
Gimme that back.

11:58.588 --> 12:02.297
Oh, great. A dog wants me
to go to Saint Petersburg.

12:06.628 --> 12:09.017
OK, I can take a hint.

12:19.548 --> 12:21.982
Heart, don't fail me now

12:22.428 --> 12:24.942
Courage, don't desert me

12:25.028 --> 12:26.427
Don't turn back

12:26.508 --> 12:29.386
Now that we're here

12:29.748 --> 12:32.467
People always say

12:32.548 --> 12:35.108
Life is full of choices

12:35.188 --> 12:39.784
No one ever mentions fear

12:39.868 --> 12:45.147
Or how the world can seem so vast

12:45.708 --> 12:49.417
On ajourney

12:49.508 --> 12:55.219
To the past

13:01.028 --> 13:03.417
Somewhere down this road

13:03.508 --> 13:06.227
I know someone's waiting

13:06.308 --> 13:10.665
Years of dreams just can't be wrong

13:11.068 --> 13:13.502
Arms will open wide

13:13.588 --> 13:16.148
I'll be safe and wanted

13:16.228 --> 13:20.062
Finally home where I belong

13:20.468 --> 13:22.663
Well, starting now

13:22.748 --> 13:25.740
I'm learning fast

13:26.348 --> 13:29.420
On this journey

13:29.828 --> 13:35.937
To the past

13:41.268 --> 13:45.978
Home, love, family

13:46.068 --> 13:50.778
There was once a time
I must have had them, too

13:51.588 --> 13:56.184
Home, love, family

13:56.268 --> 13:58.543
I will never be complete

13:58.628 --> 14:03.702
Until I find you

14:04.588 --> 14:07.227
One step at a time

14:07.308 --> 14:09.822
One hope, then another

14:09.908 --> 14:14.823
Who knows where this road may go?

14:14.908 --> 14:17.342
Back to who I was

14:17.428 --> 14:19.737
On to find my future

14:19.828 --> 14:23.980
Things my heart still needs to know

14:24.468 --> 14:27.540
Yes, let this be a sign

14:27.628 --> 14:29.823
Let this road be mine

14:29.908 --> 14:34.060
Let it lead me to my past

14:34.548 --> 14:38.063
And bring me home

14:39.468 --> 14:46.897
At last

14:53.548 --> 14:56.267
- One ticket to Paris, please.
- Exit visa.

14:56.868 --> 15:00.463
- Exit visa?
- No exit visa, no ticket!

15:05.108 --> 15:08.066
See Dimitri. He can help.

15:08.508 --> 15:12.137
- Where can I find him?
- At the old palace.

15:12.228 --> 15:14.537
But you didn't hear it from me.

15:15.628 --> 15:17.858
- Go, go, go.
- Dimitri...

15:18.828 --> 15:20.739
Nice. Nice. Very nice.

15:20.828 --> 15:23.217
- And I look like princess.
- OK...

15:23.308 --> 15:27.267
- I dance like a feather.
- Thank you. Thank you. Next, please.

15:31.068 --> 15:33.059
Grandma, it's me.

15:33.548 --> 15:35.459
Anastasia.

15:37.268 --> 15:39.259
Oh, brother.

15:41.028 --> 15:43.144
That's it, Dimitri. Game over.

15:43.228 --> 15:46.743
Our last kopeck gone
for this flea-infested theatre

15:46.828 --> 15:49.661
and still no girl to pretend to be Anastasia.

15:49.748 --> 15:53.263
We'll find her, Vlad.
She's here somewhere, right under our noses.

15:53.348 --> 15:57.785
One look at this jewellery box, the Empress
will think we have the real Anastasia.

15:57.868 --> 16:00.382
- I'm looking for...
- Before she catches on,

16:00.468 --> 16:03.460
we'll be off spending the 10 million roubles.

16:15.388 --> 16:17.379
Pooka.

16:18.468 --> 16:20.459
Pooka.

16:21.148 --> 16:22.979
Pooka, where are you?

16:26.468 --> 16:29.062
- Did you hear something?
- No.

16:40.028 --> 16:41.859
Hello?

16:41.948 --> 16:43.939
Anybody home?

17:25.548 --> 17:27.539
This place.

17:28.228 --> 17:29.786
It's...

17:29.868 --> 17:32.302
It's like a memory from a dream.

17:36.268 --> 17:38.657
Dancing bears

17:38.748 --> 17:40.739
Painted wings

17:41.428 --> 17:46.343
Things I almost remember

17:46.428 --> 17:48.623
And a song

17:48.988 --> 17:51.263
Someone sings

17:51.628 --> 17:56.418
Once upon a December

17:56.788 --> 18:01.145
Someone holds me safe and warm

18:01.628 --> 18:06.383
Horses prance through a silver storm

18:06.948 --> 18:11.419
Figures dancing gracefully

18:11.508 --> 18:16.536
Across my memory

18:45.428 --> 18:50.058
Someone holds me safe and warm

18:50.388 --> 18:54.666
Horses prance through a silver storm

18:54.988 --> 18:59.345
Figures dancing gracefully

18:59.428 --> 19:04.183
Across my memory

19:04.788 --> 19:09.498
Far away, long ago

19:09.588 --> 19:14.218
Glowing dim as an ember

19:14.308 --> 19:19.018
Things my heart used to know

19:19.108 --> 19:25.377
Things it yearns to remember

19:26.188 --> 19:28.543
And a song

19:28.628 --> 19:33.702
Someone sings

19:37.148 --> 19:43.906
Once upon a December

19:53.948 --> 19:55.939
What are you doin' in here?

20:06.268 --> 20:08.463
Stop! Stop, stop, stop.

20:08.548 --> 20:10.539
Hold on a minute. Hold on.

20:13.308 --> 20:15.981
Now, how did you get in here?

20:25.668 --> 20:27.067
Excuse me, child...

20:27.148 --> 20:29.537
Vlad, do you see what I see?

20:30.068 --> 20:31.501
No.

20:32.588 --> 20:35.102
Yes. Yes!

20:35.588 --> 20:37.897
- Are you Dimitri?
- Cute.

20:38.588 --> 20:41.182
Perhaps. Depends on who's looking for him.

20:41.268 --> 20:44.226
My name is Anya. I need travel papers.

20:44.308 --> 20:48.017
They say you're the man to see,
even though I can't tell you who said that.

20:48.108 --> 20:50.224
And what... Hey, why are you circling me?

20:50.308 --> 20:53.983
- What, were you a vulture in another life?
- I'm sorry, Anneya.

20:54.068 --> 20:56.298
- It's Anya.
- Anya.

20:56.388 --> 20:59.380
It's just that you look an awful lot like...

21:00.348 --> 21:04.466
Never mind. Now, you said
something about travel papers?

21:05.788 --> 21:07.938
Yes. I'd like to go to Paris.

21:08.028 --> 21:11.100
- You'd like to go to Paris?
- Who is this here?

21:11.588 --> 21:13.738
- Look. He likes me.
- Nice dog.

21:14.708 --> 21:18.303
Now, let me ask you something...
Anya, was it?

21:18.388 --> 21:22.461
- There's a last name that goes with that?
- Well, actually...

21:22.548 --> 21:26.018
This is gonna sound crazy.
I don't know my last name.

21:26.108 --> 21:29.657
I was found wandering around
when I was eight years old.

21:29.748 --> 21:32.023
And before that? Before you were eight?

21:32.108 --> 21:36.340
I know it's strange, but I don't remember.
I have very few memories of my past.

21:36.668 --> 21:39.023
Hm. That's perfect.

21:39.108 --> 21:41.622
I do have one clue, however.
And that is Paris.

21:41.708 --> 21:43.141
Paris?

21:43.228 --> 21:45.696
Right. So can you two help me or not?

21:46.548 --> 21:48.186
Vlad, Vlad, tickets.

21:48.268 --> 21:53.137
Sure would like to. In fact, oddly enough,
we're going to Paris ourselves.

21:54.228 --> 21:58.267
And I've got three... Well, this one is...
But I've got three tickets here.

21:58.348 --> 22:00.816
Unfortunately, the third one is for her.

22:00.908 --> 22:03.297
Anastasia.

22:04.188 --> 22:08.227
We are going to reunite the Grand Duchess
Anastasia with her grandmother.

22:08.308 --> 22:11.425
- You do kind of resemble her.
- The same blue eyes.

22:11.508 --> 22:13.942
- The Romanov eyes.
- Nicholas' smile.

22:14.028 --> 22:16.098
- Alexandra's chin.
- Oh, look.

22:16.188 --> 22:18.941
She even has the grandmother's hands.

22:19.028 --> 22:21.303
She's the same age, the same physical type.

22:21.388 --> 22:24.380
Are you trying to tell me
you think that I am Anastasia?

22:24.468 --> 22:27.346
I've seen thousands of girls
all over the country.

22:27.428 --> 22:30.659
Not one of them looks as much like
the Grand Duchess as you.

22:30.748 --> 22:33.216
- Look at the portrait.
- I knew you were crazy.

22:33.308 --> 22:35.822
- But now I think you are both mad.
- Why?

22:35.908 --> 22:39.298
- You don't remember what happened to you.
- No one knows what happened to her.

22:39.388 --> 22:41.424
You're looking for family, in Paris.

22:41.508 --> 22:43.863
And her only family is in Paris.

22:43.948 --> 22:46.098
Have you ever thought about the possibility?

22:46.188 --> 22:48.179
That I could be royalty?

22:50.708 --> 22:53.859
Well, it's kind of hard
to think of yourself as a duchess

22:53.948 --> 22:56.257
when you're sleeping on a damp floor.

22:56.348 --> 22:59.704
But, sure, every lonely girl
would hope she's a princess.

22:59.788 --> 23:03.576
And, somewhere, one little girl is.

23:05.148 --> 23:09.903
After all, the name Anastasia means
"she will rise again".

23:09.988 --> 23:14.220
Wish we could help, but the third ticket
is for the Grand Duchess Anastasia.

23:14.668 --> 23:16.659
Good luck.

23:19.108 --> 23:21.941
Why didn't you tell her
about our brilliant plan?

23:22.028 --> 23:26.579
All she wants to do is go to Paris.
Why give away a third of the reward money?

23:26.668 --> 23:28.818
I tell you, we're walking away too soon.

23:28.908 --> 23:31.581
Not to worry. I got it all under control.

23:32.108 --> 23:34.383
All right, walk a little slower.

23:45.508 --> 23:48.864
Three, two, one...

23:48.948 --> 23:52.941
- Dimitri!
- Right in the palm of our hand.

23:53.028 --> 23:55.781
- Dimitri, wait!
- Did you call me?

23:55.868 --> 24:00.623
If I don't remember who I am, then who's
to say I'm not a princess or a duchess, right?

24:01.388 --> 24:02.343
Go on.

24:02.428 --> 24:05.465
If I'm not Anastasia,
the Empress will know right away.

24:05.548 --> 24:08.267
- So it's just an honest mistake.
- Sounds plausible.

24:08.668 --> 24:11.546
But, if you are the princess,

24:11.628 --> 24:15.746
then you'll finally know who you are
and have your family back.

24:15.828 --> 24:17.819
You know, he's right.

24:17.908 --> 24:20.502
- Either way, it gets you to Paris.
- Right.

24:24.148 --> 24:29.302
May I present Her Royal Highness,
the Grand Duchess Anastasia?

24:30.428 --> 24:33.943
- Pooka, we are going to Paris.
- No, the dog stays.

24:34.028 --> 24:36.781
- What are you saying? The dog goes.
- The dog does not go.

24:36.868 --> 24:38.824
- I say he's going.
- I'm allergic to dogs.

24:39.548 --> 24:44.747
Anastasia? You have just one problem there,
fellah. Anastasia's dead.

24:44.828 --> 24:47.706
All the Romanovs are dead. They're dead.

24:47.788 --> 24:49.779
Dead, dead, dead.

24:49.868 --> 24:53.019
Am I right, my friend?
I mean, how could that be Ana...

24:58.268 --> 25:03.296
Oh, come on. Am I supposed to believe
that thing woke up after all these years

25:03.388 --> 25:06.425
just because some guy
claims she's a Romanov?

25:07.988 --> 25:13.267
OK, OK, I get the message. Enough already
with the glowing and the smoke people.

25:16.148 --> 25:22.417
If that thing's come back to life,
it must mean Anastasia's alive.

25:22.508 --> 25:24.703
- Leave the dog.
- I am not leaving the dog.

25:24.788 --> 25:27.177
- And that's her.
- We've got a train to catch.

25:30.228 --> 25:32.105
Mayday! Mayday!

25:45.428 --> 25:47.419
It's hot!

25:54.228 --> 25:56.139
Oh, boy.

25:56.228 --> 25:59.300
Ow! I tell you what... Ow!

26:00.108 --> 26:02.542
Who dares intrude on my solitude?

26:05.228 --> 26:07.219
Get out! Out!

26:08.348 --> 26:11.067
Bartok? Is that you?

26:15.268 --> 26:17.702
Master? You're alive?

26:17.788 --> 26:20.348
Yes. In a manner of speaking.

26:21.028 --> 26:23.667
Whoa, that fell right out there, sir.

26:24.388 --> 26:26.948
- Something's happened.
- Yeah.

26:27.948 --> 26:30.018
- Whoopsie.
- I knew it.

26:30.108 --> 26:33.578
I could feel the dark forces stirring.

26:33.668 --> 26:36.740
I'm not surprised, because I saw her.
Anastasia.

26:36.828 --> 26:39.137
Anastasia? Alive?

26:39.748 --> 26:41.739
Sir, your lips, they're...

26:41.828 --> 26:44.388
That Romanov brat!

26:44.468 --> 26:48.347
Ain't that the kick in the head?
I guess a curse just ain't what it used to be.

26:48.428 --> 26:51.625
That's why I was stuck here in limbo.

26:51.708 --> 26:54.097
My curse is unfulfilled.

27:01.188 --> 27:03.179
Look at me.

27:03.628 --> 27:05.619
I am falling apart.

27:07.748 --> 27:09.978
I'm a wreck!

27:10.068 --> 27:14.858
Actually, considering how long
you've been dead, you look pretty good.

27:15.828 --> 27:18.422
- Sir, you do. You do.
- Really?

27:18.508 --> 27:21.545
Sir, is this the face of a bat
who would lie to you?

27:22.188 --> 27:25.544
Come on, for a minute there,
you had your old spark back.

27:25.628 --> 27:30.258
If only I hadn't lost the gift
from the dark forces.

27:30.868 --> 27:33.428
The key to my powers.

27:33.508 --> 27:36.102
What? You mean this reliquary?

27:36.188 --> 27:39.703
- Where did you get that?
- Oh, I found it.

27:39.788 --> 27:42.825
- Give it to me!
- All right, all right. Don't get so grabby.

27:42.908 --> 27:45.297
My old friend.

27:45.388 --> 27:47.060
Together again.

27:49.388 --> 27:53.063
Now my dark purpose will be fulfilled.

27:53.148 --> 27:58.268
And the last of the Romanovs will die!

27:59.028 --> 28:01.747
In the dark of the night
I was tossing and turning

28:03.188 --> 28:05.986
And the nightmare I had was as bad as can be

28:07.948 --> 28:10.064
It scared me out of my wits

28:10.148 --> 28:12.139
A corpse falling to bits

28:12.228 --> 28:15.459
Then I opened my eyes
and the nightmare was me

28:16.628 --> 28:19.381
I was once the most
mystical man in all Russia

28:21.068 --> 28:23.707
When the royals betrayed me
they made a mistake

28:25.668 --> 28:27.659
My curse made each of them pay

28:27.748 --> 28:29.739
But one little girl got away

28:29.828 --> 28:33.867
Little Anya beware, Rasputin's awake

28:34.268 --> 28:38.341
In the dark of the night, evil will find her

28:38.748 --> 28:41.979
In the dark of the night, just before dawn

28:42.908 --> 28:44.899
Revenge will be sweet

28:44.988 --> 28:47.548
When the curse is complete

28:47.628 --> 28:50.904
- In the dark of the night
- She'll be gone!

28:51.988 --> 28:54.183
Hi, ladies. Listen, I...

28:54.268 --> 28:57.305
I can feel that my powers are slowly returning

28:58.468 --> 29:02.097
Tie my sash,
add a dash of cologne for that smell

29:02.948 --> 29:05.223
As the pieces fall into place

29:05.308 --> 29:07.299
I'll see her crawl into place

29:07.828 --> 29:09.739
Do svidaniya, Anya, Your Grace

29:09.828 --> 29:11.784
Farewell

29:11.868 --> 29:16.498
- In the dark of the night, terror will strike her
- Terror's the least I can do!

29:16.588 --> 29:20.661
In the dark of the night, evil will brew

29:20.748 --> 29:22.500
Soon she will feel

29:22.588 --> 29:25.102
That her nightmares are real

29:25.188 --> 29:26.701
In the dark of the night

29:26.788 --> 29:28.779
She'll be through!

29:29.628 --> 29:32.700
In the dark of the night, evil will find her

29:32.788 --> 29:34.141
Find her

29:34.228 --> 29:37.186
In the dark of the night, terror comes through

29:37.268 --> 29:40.180
- Doom her
- My dear, here's a sign

29:40.268 --> 29:42.862
It's the end of the line

29:42.948 --> 29:44.904
In the dark of the night

29:44.988 --> 29:47.297
In the dark of the night

29:47.388 --> 29:49.538
Come, my minions

29:49.628 --> 29:51.698
Rise for your master

29:51.788 --> 29:54.700
Let your evil shine

29:54.788 --> 29:56.380
In the dark of the night

29:56.468 --> 29:57.742
Find her now

29:57.828 --> 30:00.706
Yes, fly ever faster

30:00.788 --> 30:04.337
In the dark of the night
In the dark of the night

30:04.428 --> 30:07.181
She'll be mine!

30:31.148 --> 30:33.423
Oh. The mutt gets the window seat.

30:37.748 --> 30:41.741
Stop fiddling with that. Sit up straight.
Remember, you're a grand duchess.

30:41.828 --> 30:44.422
How do you know
what grand duchesses do or don't do?

30:44.508 --> 30:46.897
I make it my business to know.

30:47.988 --> 30:50.502
Look, Anya, I'm just trying to help, all right?

30:53.028 --> 30:55.417
Dimitri, do you really think I'm royalty?

30:55.508 --> 30:58.784
- You know I do.
- Then stop bossing me around.

31:00.508 --> 31:02.703
She certainly has a mind of her own.

31:03.228 --> 31:05.822
Yeah. I hate that in a woman.

31:20.148 --> 31:23.584
- Look, I think we got off on the wrong foot.
- I think we did too.

31:23.668 --> 31:26.057
- But I appreciate your apology.
- Apology?

31:26.148 --> 31:28.218
An apology? I was just saying...

31:28.308 --> 31:31.664
Please, don't talk any more.
It's only gonna upset me.

31:31.748 --> 31:34.945
- Fine. I'll be quiet, if you will.
- All right, I'll be quiet.

31:35.028 --> 31:35.619
- Fine.
- Fine.

31:35.708 --> 31:37.699
- Fine.
- Fine.

31:39.068 --> 31:41.662
- Think you'll miss it?
- Miss what, your talking?

31:41.748 --> 31:43.943
No. Russia.

31:44.948 --> 31:46.939
- Nope.
- But it was your home.

31:47.028 --> 31:49.098
It was a place I once lived.

31:49.188 --> 31:51.383
Then you plan on making Paris your home?

31:51.468 --> 31:53.459
What is it with you and homes?

31:53.548 --> 31:57.257
Well, for one thing,
it's something every normal person wants.

31:57.348 --> 31:59.543
- For another thing, you...
- What?

31:59.628 --> 32:02.188
- Just forget it.
- Fine.

32:02.828 --> 32:05.900
Thank goodness it's you.
Please, remove him from my sight.

32:05.988 --> 32:08.786
- What have you done to her?
- Me? It's her.

32:12.148 --> 32:14.537
An unspoken attraction.

32:14.628 --> 32:18.462
Attraction? That skinny little brat?
Have you lost your mind?

32:18.548 --> 32:22.507
- Only asking a simple question.
- Attraction. Ridiculous.

32:36.788 --> 32:39.985
Last month, the travelling papers were blue.

32:40.068 --> 32:42.059
But now they are red.

32:43.308 --> 32:45.663
Papers. Papers, please.

32:49.508 --> 32:51.703
It's what I hate about this government.

32:51.788 --> 32:53.858
- Everything's in red.
- Red?

32:54.508 --> 32:57.739
I propose we move to the baggage car
before the guards come.

32:57.828 --> 32:59.819
I propose we get off this train.

33:12.628 --> 33:14.778
Sorry. I thought you were someone else.

33:14.868 --> 33:17.257
Oh, it's you. Well, that's OK then.

33:17.348 --> 33:19.339
- We've got to go.
- Where are we going?

33:19.428 --> 33:21.339
I think you broke my nose.

33:21.428 --> 33:23.419
Men are such babies.

33:27.468 --> 33:29.982
Yes. Yes, this will do nicely.

33:31.188 --> 33:34.180
- She'll freeze in here.
- She can thaw in Paris.

33:34.268 --> 33:39.467
The baggage car? There's nothing
wrong with our papers, is there, maestro?

33:39.548 --> 33:41.539
Of course not, Your Grace.

33:41.628 --> 33:47.146
It's just that I hate to see you forced
to mingle with all those commoners.

33:54.868 --> 33:57.063
- What was that?
- I don't know.

33:57.148 --> 33:59.184
But there goes the dining car.

34:00.508 --> 34:02.499
- Get off of me!
- I'm trying.

34:04.628 --> 34:07.096
- Uh, Dimitri.
- What?

34:07.188 --> 34:10.498
I think someone has flambéed our engine.

34:13.628 --> 34:15.619
Something's not right.

34:17.788 --> 34:19.779
Wait here. I'll check it out.

34:27.108 --> 34:29.576
Anybody here?

34:31.268 --> 34:33.259
We're going way too fast!

34:34.388 --> 34:37.425
Nobody's driving this train.
We're gonna have to jump.

34:38.908 --> 34:40.899
Did you say jump?

34:42.188 --> 34:46.466
- After you.
- Fine. Then we'll uncouple the car.

34:53.467 --> 34:55.902
Come on! I need a wrench, an axe, anything.

34:56.668 --> 34:58.659
Here.

35:06.468 --> 35:09.778
Come on, there's gotta be
something in there better than this.

35:09.868 --> 35:11.426
That'll work.

35:12.988 --> 35:14.706
Go, go, go!

35:15.948 --> 35:18.064
What did they teach you in the orphanage?

35:22.908 --> 35:24.899
The brakes are out!

35:25.508 --> 35:27.738
Turn harder!

35:29.068 --> 35:32.902
Don't worry. We've got plenty of track.
We'll just coast to a stop.

35:40.668 --> 35:41.896
You were saying?

35:44.348 --> 35:46.942
I got an idea, Vlad. Gimme a hand with this.

35:51.788 --> 35:53.858
Hand me the chain.

35:53.948 --> 35:56.223
- Not you!
- Vlad's busy at the moment.

36:10.388 --> 36:12.538
And to think that could have been you.

36:14.548 --> 36:17.221
If we live through this,
remind me to thank you.

36:20.028 --> 36:22.462
Here goes nothin'. Brace yourselves.

36:34.908 --> 36:37.263
Well, this is our stop.

36:56.988 --> 37:00.776
I hate trains.
Remind me never to get on the train again.

37:05.788 --> 37:07.346
Wow.

37:07.428 --> 37:11.546
Take it easy there. Sir, really,
you should watch your blood pressure.

37:11.628 --> 37:14.984
My nephew, lzzie,
just keeled over one day, mid-mango.

37:16.108 --> 37:18.986
Stress, it's a killer, sir. And he's a fruit bat.

37:19.068 --> 37:21.059
No meat. No blood, even.

37:22.748 --> 37:24.739
How could they let her escape?

37:25.428 --> 37:28.386
You're right. It's very upsetting, sir.

37:28.468 --> 37:30.459
I guess this reliquary's broken.

37:31.988 --> 37:33.979
You idiot!

37:40.948 --> 37:45.738
All right now, sir. Take it easy there. Just
remember what I said to you about stress.

37:45.828 --> 37:47.898
I sold my soul for this.

37:49.748 --> 37:52.785
My life, my very existence, depends on it.

37:52.868 --> 37:56.577
And you almost destroyed it.

37:56.668 --> 37:59.705
I get it. I get it. You break it, you bought it.

37:59.788 --> 38:04.100
See that you remember,
you miserable rodent!

38:06.468 --> 38:08.857
Sure, blame the bat. We're easy targets.

38:08.948 --> 38:10.939
What are you muttering about?

38:11.028 --> 38:14.464
Anastasia, sir.
Just wishing I could do the job for you, sir.

38:14.548 --> 38:16.539
I'd give her a... And a...

38:17.188 --> 38:18.860
And then a...

38:18.948 --> 38:21.178
And I'd kick her, sir.

38:21.268 --> 38:23.828
Oh, I have something else in mind.

38:23.908 --> 38:26.217
Something more enticing.

38:26.308 --> 38:29.778
Something really cruel.

38:37.868 --> 38:42.066
- Are we gonna walk to Paris?
- We'll take a boat in Germany.

38:42.148 --> 38:45.458
- Then we're walking to Germany?
- No, Your Grace, we're taking a bus.

38:45.548 --> 38:47.539
A bus.

38:47.868 --> 38:49.859
That's nice.

38:50.308 --> 38:52.299
Sophie, my dear!

38:53.068 --> 38:54.945
Vlady's on his way!

38:55.788 --> 38:59.906
- Who's Sophie?
- Who's Sophie? She's a tender little morsel.

38:59.988 --> 39:03.298
A cup of hot chocolate
after a long walk in the snow.

39:03.388 --> 39:05.299
Vlad, ix-nay on the Ophie-say.

39:05.388 --> 39:10.098
She's a decadent pastry
filled with whipped cream and laughter.

39:10.188 --> 39:15.137
- Is this a person or a cream puff?
- She is the Empress' ravishing first cousin.

39:15.228 --> 39:19.744
But I thought we were going to see
the Empress herself.

39:19.828 --> 39:22.217
Why are we going to see her cousin?

39:23.068 --> 39:24.547
Dimitri?

39:24.628 --> 39:29.099
Well, nobody gets near the Dowager Empress
without convincing Sophie first.

39:29.868 --> 39:32.302
Oh, no. Not me. No.

39:32.388 --> 39:36.222
Nobody told me I had to prove
I was the Grand Duchess.

39:36.308 --> 39:38.538
- Look...
- Show up, yes. Look nice, fine.

39:38.628 --> 39:42.382
- But lie?
- You don't know it's a lie. What if it's true?

39:42.988 --> 39:46.537
OK, so it's one more stop on the road
to finding out who you are.

39:46.628 --> 39:49.825
I thought this was something
you had to see through to the end.

39:49.908 --> 39:53.901
Look at me, Dimitri. I am not exactly
grand duchess material here.

40:02.868 --> 40:05.177
Tell me, child. What do you see?

40:06.108 --> 40:10.863
I see a skinny little nobody
with no past and no future.

40:12.988 --> 40:16.901
I see an engaging and fiery young woman,

40:16.988 --> 40:22.187
who, on occasion, has shown a regal
command equal to any royal in the world.

40:24.028 --> 40:27.179
And I have known my share of royalty.

40:28.548 --> 40:30.539
You see, my dear,

40:30.628 --> 40:34.462
I was a member of the lmperial Court.

40:39.748 --> 40:44.060
So, are you ready to become
the Grand Duchess Anastasia?

40:44.788 --> 40:48.576
- What?
- There is nothing left for you back there.

40:49.428 --> 40:52.067
Everything is in Paris.

40:56.748 --> 40:59.467
Gentlemen, start your teaching.

41:00.108 --> 41:01.700
I remember it well.

41:02.068 --> 41:05.504
You were born in a palace by the sea

41:05.588 --> 41:06.907
A palace by the sea?

41:06.988 --> 41:08.979
- Could it be?
- Yes, that's right.

41:09.068 --> 41:11.946
You rode horseback
when you were only three.

41:12.028 --> 41:13.825
Horseback riding? Me?

41:13.908 --> 41:15.899
- And the horse...
- He was white.

41:15.988 --> 41:20.425
- You made faces and terrorised the cook
- Threw him in the brook

41:20.508 --> 41:22.339
- Was I wild?
- Wrote the book.

41:22.428 --> 41:25.306
But you'd behave
when your father gave that look

41:25.388 --> 41:28.346
- Imagine how it was
- Your long-forgotten past

41:28.428 --> 41:31.738
We've lots and lots to teach you
And the time is going fast

41:32.108 --> 41:34.383
All right. I'm ready.

41:34.468 --> 41:37.699
- Now shoulders back and stand up tall
- And do not walk, but try to float.

41:37.788 --> 41:41.098
- I feel a little foolish. Am I floating?
- Like a little boat.

41:41.188 --> 41:42.416
- You give a bow
- What happens now?

41:42.508 --> 41:44.146
Your hand receives a kiss

41:44.228 --> 41:47.106
Most of all, remember this

41:47.188 --> 41:50.066
If I can learn to do it, you can learn to do it

41:50.468 --> 41:53.505
- Something in you knows it
- There's nothing to it

41:53.588 --> 41:56.500
Follow in my footsteps, shoe by shoe

41:56.868 --> 41:59.143
You can learn to do it, too

41:59.668 --> 42:02.501
- Now elbows in and sit up straight.
- And never slurp the stroganoff.

42:02.588 --> 42:05.785
- I never cared for stroganoff.
- She said that like a Romanov.

42:05.868 --> 42:07.142
- The samovar.
- The caviar.

42:07.228 --> 42:08.946
Dessert and then good night?

42:09.028 --> 42:11.781
Not until you get this right

42:11.868 --> 42:15.224
If I can learn to do it, you can learn to do it

42:15.308 --> 42:18.220
Pull yourself together
and you'll pull through it

42:18.548 --> 42:21.665
Tell yourself it's easy and it's true

42:21.748 --> 42:24.103
You can learn to do it, too

42:24.948 --> 42:27.940
Next, we memorise the names of the royalty.

42:28.028 --> 42:29.381
Now here we have Kropotkin

42:29.468 --> 42:31.220
- Shot Potemkin
- In the Botkin

42:31.308 --> 42:33.299
And dear old Uncle Vanya loved his vodka

42:33.388 --> 42:34.218
- Got it, Anya?
- No.

42:34.308 --> 42:36.105
- The Baron Pushkin
- He was short

42:36.188 --> 42:37.337
- Count Anatoly
- Had a wart

42:37.428 --> 42:39.100
- Count Sergei
- Wore a feathered hat

42:39.188 --> 42:40.780
I hear he's gotten very fat

42:40.868 --> 42:42.859
And I recall his yellow cat

42:43.748 --> 42:45.739
I don't believe we told her that.

42:47.708 --> 42:50.939
If you can learn to do it, I can learn to do it

42:51.028 --> 42:54.225
- Don't know how you knew it
- I simply knew it

42:54.308 --> 42:57.106
Suddenly I feel like someone new

42:57.588 --> 43:00.056
Anya, you're a dream come true

43:00.148 --> 43:02.867
- If I can learn to do it
- You can learn to do it

43:02.948 --> 43:05.178
- You can learn to do it
- Pull yourself together

43:05.268 --> 43:06.747
And you'll pull through it

43:06.828 --> 43:09.820
- Tell yourself it's easy
- And it's true

43:09.908 --> 43:12.741
- You can learn to do it
- Nothing to it

43:12.828 --> 43:18.061
You can learn to do it, too

43:27.068 --> 43:29.059
Here. I bought you a dress.

43:30.868 --> 43:33.382
You bought me a tent.

43:35.588 --> 43:39.706
- What are you lookin' for?
- The Russian Circus. I think it's still in here.

43:40.148 --> 43:42.503
Come on. Just put it on.

43:53.868 --> 43:55.096
Checkmate.

44:02.228 --> 44:04.025
Wonderful!

44:04.108 --> 44:05.905
Marvellous!

44:07.548 --> 44:10.984
And now you are dressed for a ball.

44:11.068 --> 44:13.502
And you will learn to dance for one as well.

44:13.588 --> 44:15.579
Dimitri...

44:15.668 --> 44:17.659
I'm... I'm not very good at it.

44:19.108 --> 44:20.063
And...

44:21.348 --> 44:23.339
One, two, three. One, two, three.

44:23.428 --> 44:26.226
No. Anya, you don't lead. Let him.

44:33.228 --> 44:35.423
That dress is really beautiful.

44:35.508 --> 44:38.068
- Do you think so?
- Yes.

44:39.348 --> 44:42.385
It was nice on the hanger,
but it looks even better on you.

44:42.468 --> 44:45.266
- You should wear it.
- I am wearing it.

44:45.348 --> 44:47.339
Right. Of course.

44:47.868 --> 44:49.859
I'm just trying to give you a...

44:50.468 --> 44:52.459
Compliment?

44:52.548 --> 44:54.539
Of course. Yes.

44:58.188 --> 45:01.737
It's one, two, three and suddenly

45:01.828 --> 45:04.342
I see it at a glance

45:04.428 --> 45:10.663
She's radiant and confident
and born to take this chance

45:10.748 --> 45:13.626
I taught her well, I planned it all

45:13.708 --> 45:17.098
I just forgot romance

45:19.068 --> 45:21.502
Vlad, how could you do this?

45:22.108 --> 45:25.703
How will we get through this?

45:25.788 --> 45:32.227
I never should have let them dance

45:36.988 --> 45:39.218
I'm feeling a little dizzy.

45:39.788 --> 45:42.063
- Kind of light-headed?
- Yeah.

45:43.068 --> 45:44.660
Me too.

45:44.748 --> 45:46.739
Probably from spinning.

45:48.708 --> 45:51.176
Maybe we should stop.

45:51.268 --> 45:53.259
We have stopped.

45:54.388 --> 45:56.379
- Anya, I...
- Yes?

46:04.428 --> 46:06.419
You're doing fine.

46:22.887 --> 46:25.685
- Are you all right?
- Fine. Fine.

46:25.767 --> 46:28.281
Just riddled with envy. Look at him.

46:28.887 --> 46:31.082
He can sleep through anything.

46:44.727 --> 46:46.718
Pretty jewellery box, isn't it?

46:46.807 --> 46:48.798
Jewellery box?

46:48.887 --> 46:50.878
Are you sure that's what it is?

46:50.967 --> 46:52.958
What else could it be?

46:53.847 --> 46:56.520
Something else. Something special.

46:57.527 --> 46:59.518
Something to do with a secret.

47:02.167 --> 47:05.284
- Is that possible?
- Anything's possible.

47:05.367 --> 47:07.722
You taught Dimitri how to waltz, didn't you?

47:16.727 --> 47:18.957
Sleep well, Your Majesty.

47:27.247 --> 47:29.238
Sweet dreams, Pooka.

47:31.647 --> 47:33.797
There she is, master.

47:33.887 --> 47:36.447
Sound asleep in her little bed.

47:36.527 --> 47:39.360
And pleasant dreams to you,

47:39.447 --> 47:41.438
Princess.

47:42.367 --> 47:44.756
I'll get inside your mind,

47:44.847 --> 47:47.486
where you can't escape me.

48:52.087 --> 48:54.078
Come on.

49:12.127 --> 49:13.685
What? What? What?

49:14.167 --> 49:16.158
Pooka. Pooka, what?

49:17.527 --> 49:19.245
Anya! Anya!

49:24.527 --> 49:26.085
Anya!

49:37.087 --> 49:38.805
Hello, sunshine.

49:39.887 --> 49:41.081
Hello!

49:41.167 --> 49:42.919
Jump in. Jump!

49:50.807 --> 49:52.399
Anya!

49:59.647 --> 50:02.115
Anya! Stop!

50:02.207 --> 50:04.277
Anya, no!

50:05.127 --> 50:07.118
Yes, jump!

50:07.207 --> 50:09.402
The Romanov curse!

50:09.487 --> 50:10.397
Jump!

50:11.287 --> 50:12.515
Jump!

50:19.727 --> 50:20.876
No.

50:20.967 --> 50:23.117
Anya! Anya, wake up.

50:23.207 --> 50:25.198
Wake up!

50:28.127 --> 50:31.039
- The Romanov curse.
- What are you talking about?

50:31.127 --> 50:33.880
I keep seeing faces. So many faces.

50:35.847 --> 50:37.838
It was a nightmare.

50:38.527 --> 50:40.757
It's all right now. You're safe now.

50:44.127 --> 50:46.641
No!

50:49.407 --> 50:51.204
Easy, master. Wow.

50:52.607 --> 50:54.598
This is no time to lose your head.

50:54.687 --> 50:56.564
You're right.

50:56.647 --> 50:58.638
I am calm.

50:59.407 --> 51:01.398
I am heartless.

51:02.407 --> 51:06.082
I have no feelings whatsoever.

51:06.167 --> 51:07.122
Sir?

51:07.207 --> 51:10.358
I feel a sudden onset of clarity, Bartok.

51:11.727 --> 51:14.639
I'll have to kill her myself in person.

51:15.407 --> 51:19.036
- What, you mean physically?
- You know what they say.

51:19.127 --> 51:21.402
If you want something done right...

51:22.887 --> 51:25.196
But that means going topside.

51:25.287 --> 51:27.278
Exactly.

51:27.847 --> 51:31.283
I have so many fond memories of Paris.

51:31.367 --> 51:37.476
And killing the last of the Romanovs
with my own hands will be so delicious.

51:40.847 --> 51:44.681
- Time to go.
- But you're dead. You're falling apart, sir.

51:44.767 --> 51:47.235
How do you expect to get to Paris
in one piece?

51:47.327 --> 51:49.477
I thought we'd take the train.

52:02.247 --> 52:05.319
Ah, yes. I remember so well.

52:05.407 --> 52:08.399
Uncle Yashin was from Moscow.

52:08.487 --> 52:11.160
Uncle Boris was from Odessa.

52:11.247 --> 52:15.365
- And every spring...
- We'd take picnics by the shore on Sunday.

52:16.287 --> 52:18.801
Haven't you anything better to do?

52:18.887 --> 52:21.196
Oh, dear. You have to leave now. Yes.

52:21.287 --> 52:23.278
Goodbye.

52:23.807 --> 52:26.002
No more. No more.

52:28.767 --> 52:32.646
I must say, I'm so sorry.
I thought that one surely was real.

52:32.727 --> 52:36.720
Well, she was real. I mean, she was
human, of course, but not our real.

52:36.807 --> 52:38.798
But we won't be fooled next time.

52:38.887 --> 52:42.118
No, I am going to think
of really hard questions.

52:43.087 --> 52:44.839
No.

52:44.927 --> 52:47.646
My heart can't take it any more.

52:47.727 --> 52:50.764
I will see no more girls
claiming to be Anastasia.

52:56.407 --> 52:59.604
- Where is Uncle Boris from?
- What if Sophie doesn't recognise me?

52:59.687 --> 53:02.121
She will. You're Anastasia.

53:02.207 --> 53:05.517
It's just that three days ago
I didn't have any past at all

53:05.607 --> 53:08.519
and now I'm trying to remember
an entire lifetime.

53:08.607 --> 53:12.520
That's why you got me.
Now, where was Uncle Boris from?

53:12.607 --> 53:14.518
Moscow?

53:16.647 --> 53:18.478
Oui, monsieur?

53:20.127 --> 53:25.076
Sophie Stanislovskievna Somorkov-Smirnoff!

53:25.647 --> 53:30.482
Vladimir Vanya Voinitsky Vasilovich!

53:31.207 --> 53:34.722
Well, this is unexpected.

53:34.807 --> 53:37.719
But look at me. Where are my manners?

53:38.207 --> 53:40.801
Come in, everyone.

53:41.647 --> 53:45.526
I am palpitating with amazement
and shock and surprise.

53:47.487 --> 53:53.835
May I present Her lmperial Highness
the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolayevna?

53:53.927 --> 53:56.282
Oh, my heavens.

53:56.367 --> 53:59.598
She certainly does look like Anastasia.

54:00.207 --> 54:02.562
But so did many of the others.

54:03.367 --> 54:06.006
- Where were you born?
- At the Peterhoff Palace.

54:06.087 --> 54:10.717
Correct.
And how does Anastasia like her tea?

54:11.487 --> 54:13.796
I don't like tea. Just hot water and lemon.

54:22.327 --> 54:27.560
Finally, you'll most likely find this
an impertinent question,

54:27.647 --> 54:29.717
but indulge me.

54:31.207 --> 54:35.997
How did you escape
during the siege of the palace?

54:41.327 --> 54:43.318
There was a boy.

54:43.407 --> 54:46.285
A boy who worked in the palace.

54:47.567 --> 54:49.285
He opened a wall.

54:50.807 --> 54:52.923
I'm sorry. That's crazy.

54:53.287 --> 54:55.278
Walls opening.

54:56.687 --> 54:58.917
So, is she a Romanov?

55:00.087 --> 55:03.045
Well, she answered every question.

55:03.127 --> 55:05.960
You hear that, child? You did it!

55:10.247 --> 55:14.035
- So, when do we go and see the Empress?
- I'm afraid you don't.

55:14.127 --> 55:15.765
Come again, my pet.

55:15.847 --> 55:18.236
The Empress simply won't allow it.

55:18.327 --> 55:20.443
Now, Sophie, my bright diamond,

55:20.527 --> 55:25.806
surely you can think of some way to arrange
a brief interview with the Dowager?

55:25.887 --> 55:29.038
I refuse to budge
until an answer occurs to you.

55:29.127 --> 55:30.321
Please.

55:30.407 --> 55:36.516
Do you like the Russian Ballet? I believe
they're performing in Paris tonight.

55:36.607 --> 55:40.282
The Dowager Empress and I
love the Russian Ballet.

55:41.647 --> 55:44.081
We never miss it.

55:45.767 --> 55:48.918
We did it!

55:49.007 --> 55:52.124
We're going to see
the lmperial Highness tonight.

55:52.207 --> 55:55.040
We're going to get the 10 million roubles.

55:55.367 --> 55:58.245
- We're going to be...
- Vlad. Vlad.

55:58.607 --> 56:02.600
- She is the princess.
- Anya was extraordinary!

56:02.687 --> 56:06.043
I almost believed her. And Sophie...

56:06.207 --> 56:09.358
Sophie wants to take us shopping
for the ballet.

56:09.447 --> 56:11.915
Shopping in Paris. Can you believe it?

56:19.487 --> 56:21.478
Lovers!

56:22.727 --> 56:24.319
Ooh, la-la!

56:29.167 --> 56:32.477
Welcome, my friends, to Paree

56:33.967 --> 56:37.437
Here, have a flower on me

56:38.967 --> 56:41.117
Forget where you're from

56:41.607 --> 56:45.122
You're in France - children, come

56:45.567 --> 56:50.880
I'll show you that French joie de vivre

56:52.287 --> 56:55.245
Paree holds the key to your heart

56:56.007 --> 56:59.079
And all of Paree plays a part

56:59.167 --> 57:00.361
Bonjour!

57:00.447 --> 57:04.235
- You'll stroll two-by-two
- Down what we call La Rue

57:04.327 --> 57:08.002
And soon all Paree will be singing to you

57:08.087 --> 57:09.236
Ooh, la-la!

57:09.327 --> 57:12.399
Ooh, la-la! Ooh, la-laaa!

57:12.487 --> 57:15.877
Paree holds the key to I'amour

57:16.287 --> 57:19.916
And not even Freud knows the cure

57:20.127 --> 57:24.643
- There's love in the air
- At the Folies Bergère

57:24.727 --> 57:27.287
The French have it down to an art

57:28.287 --> 57:32.883
Paree holds the key to your heart

57:32.967 --> 57:34.161
Ooh, la-la!

57:34.247 --> 57:38.081
When you're feeling blue, come to Le Moulin

57:38.527 --> 57:42.315
When your heart says "don't"
the French say "do"

57:42.767 --> 57:46.965
When you think you can't,
you'll find you cancan

57:47.047 --> 57:49.038
Everyone can cancan

57:49.127 --> 57:51.482
You can cancan, too

58:05.327 --> 58:09.320
Paree holds the key to her past

58:10.727 --> 58:14.879
Yes, Princess, I've found you at last

58:16.087 --> 58:18.078
No more pretend

58:18.167 --> 58:20.965
You'll be gone, that's the end

58:27.007 --> 58:31.205
Paree holds the key to your heart

58:31.727 --> 58:35.640
You'll be très jolie and so smart

58:36.367 --> 58:41.043
- Come dance through the night
- And forget all your woes

58:41.127 --> 58:45.643
- The city of light
- Where a rose is a rose

58:45.727 --> 58:50.164
And one never knows what will start

58:50.247 --> 58:55.799
Paree holds the key

58:55.887 --> 58:58.355
To her

58:58.447 --> 59:01.803
Heart

59:03.007 --> 59:05.282
Ooh, la-la! Ooh, la-la!

59:19.847 --> 59:22.486
We don't have anything to be nervous about.

59:22.967 --> 59:25.481
- She's the princess.
- I know. I know. But...

59:25.567 --> 59:27.717
No. No, you don't know.

59:29.847 --> 59:32.600
I was the boy in the palace.

59:32.687 --> 59:36.726
The one who opened the wall.
She's the real thing, Vlad.

59:39.327 --> 59:43.240
That means our Anya has found her family.

59:44.767 --> 59:49.522
We have found the heir to the Russian throne.

59:51.967 --> 59:54.959
- And you...
- Will walk out of her life for ever.

59:56.007 --> 59:59.636
- But...
- Princesses don't marry kitchen boys.

59:59.727 --> 01:00:00.955
I know, but...

01:00:01.047 --> 01:00:04.596
We're going to go through with this
as if nothing has changed.

01:00:04.687 --> 01:00:06.678
You've got to tell her.

01:00:07.087 --> 01:00:09.078
Tell me what?

01:00:12.807 --> 01:00:15.002
How... how beautiful you look.

01:00:16.207 --> 01:00:18.402
Well, thank you.

01:00:28.407 --> 01:00:29.726
Monsieur.

01:00:50.767 --> 01:00:52.758
Look. There she is.

01:00:57.447 --> 01:00:59.836
Please, let her remember me.

01:01:20.127 --> 01:01:22.118
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:01:26.727 --> 01:01:29.366
Come on. I guess it's time.

01:01:29.807 --> 01:01:31.798
Relax. You're gonna be great.

01:01:33.967 --> 01:01:36.197
Deep breath. Everything's gonna be fine.

01:01:36.287 --> 01:01:39.882
Wait here forjust a moment.
I'll go in and announce you properly.

01:01:40.607 --> 01:01:42.598
- Dimitri...
- Yes?

01:01:43.527 --> 01:01:45.722
Look, we've been through a lot together.

01:01:47.687 --> 01:01:50.326
- And I just wanted to...
- Yes?

01:01:50.767 --> 01:01:52.758
Well...

01:01:53.127 --> 01:01:55.118
Thank you, I guess.

01:01:55.207 --> 01:01:57.846
Yes. Thank you, for everything.

01:01:59.047 --> 01:02:01.607
- Anya, I...
- Yes?

01:02:02.767 --> 01:02:05.361
- I'm... I...
- Yes?

01:02:07.967 --> 01:02:10.162
I want to wish you good luck, I guess.

01:02:13.687 --> 01:02:15.678
Good luck.

01:02:15.767 --> 01:02:17.758
Well, here goes.

01:02:21.247 --> 01:02:24.478
Please inform Her Majesty,
the Dowager Empress,

01:02:24.567 --> 01:02:28.196
that I have found her granddaughter,
the Grand Duchess Anastasia.

01:02:28.287 --> 01:02:30.437
She's waiting to see herjust outside.

01:02:30.527 --> 01:02:36.841
I'm very sorry, young man, but
the Dowager Empress, she will see no one.

01:02:36.927 --> 01:02:42.399
Tell that impertinent young man that I have
seen enough Grand Duchess Anastasias

01:02:42.487 --> 01:02:44.603
to last me a lifetime.

01:02:44.687 --> 01:02:46.917
- You'd better go.
- Please, let me just...

01:02:47.007 --> 01:02:53.480
Now, if you'll excuse me, I wish to live out
the remainder of my lonely life in peace.

01:02:54.807 --> 01:02:56.798
I'll see you to the door.

01:02:57.247 --> 01:02:59.317
Come, come now. Come to the door.

01:03:02.447 --> 01:03:04.597
Your Majesty, I intend you no harm.

01:03:06.167 --> 01:03:08.681
My name is Dimitri.
I used to work at the palace.

01:03:08.767 --> 01:03:11.565
Well, that's one I haven't heard, I must say.

01:03:13.287 --> 01:03:16.120
Wait. Don't go. Please.
If you'll just hear me out...

01:03:16.207 --> 01:03:19.722
I know what you're after. I've seen it before.

01:03:19.807 --> 01:03:22.719
Men who train young women
in the royal ways.

01:03:22.807 --> 01:03:27.483
- But if Your Highness will just listen...
- Haven't you been listening? Enough.

01:03:27.567 --> 01:03:31.242
I don't care how much you have fashioned
this girl to look like her,

01:03:31.327 --> 01:03:33.318
sound like her or act like her.

01:03:33.407 --> 01:03:35.398
In the end, it never is her.

01:03:35.487 --> 01:03:39.275
- This time it is her.
- Dimitri. I've heard of you.

01:03:39.847 --> 01:03:41.997
You're that con man from St Petersburg

01:03:42.087 --> 01:03:46.558
who was holding auditions
to find an Anastasia lookalike.

01:03:46.647 --> 01:03:48.717
But we've come all the way from Russia...

01:03:48.807 --> 01:03:51.401
And others have come from Timbuktu.

01:03:51.687 --> 01:03:53.723
No. It's not what you think.

01:03:53.807 --> 01:03:59.200
How much pain will you inflict on an
old woman for money? Remove him at once.

01:03:59.287 --> 01:04:04.486
But she is Anastasia. I'm telling you.
If you'll only speak to her, you'll see.

01:04:08.527 --> 01:04:10.802
- It was all a lie, wasn't it?
- No. No.

01:04:11.047 --> 01:04:13.163
You used me?

01:04:13.247 --> 01:04:15.966
I was just part of your con to get her money?

01:04:16.047 --> 01:04:20.723
No. No, no, no. It started out that way,
but everything's different now,

01:04:20.807 --> 01:04:22.957
because you really are Anastasia.

01:04:23.047 --> 01:04:24.765
- You are.
- Stop it!

01:04:24.847 --> 01:04:27.725
From the very beginning, you lied!

01:04:27.807 --> 01:04:30.799
And I not only believed you, I actually...

01:04:31.487 --> 01:04:35.765
Anya, please. When you spoke of
the door of the wall opening and the boy...

01:04:35.847 --> 01:04:37.644
- Listen to me. That was...
- No!

01:04:37.727 --> 01:04:42.676
I don't want to hear about anything that I said
or remembered. You just leave me alone!

01:04:43.927 --> 01:04:46.043
Anya, please. You have to know the truth!

01:04:56.607 --> 01:04:58.598
Your Majesty.

01:05:09.167 --> 01:05:10.805
Ilya, slow down.

01:05:10.887 --> 01:05:13.481
I'm not llya. And I won't slow down.

01:05:13.567 --> 01:05:15.876
- Not until you listen.
- You!

01:05:15.967 --> 01:05:19.084
How dare you? Stop this car immediately.

01:05:19.167 --> 01:05:20.885
Stop this car!

01:05:34.447 --> 01:05:36.642
You have to talk to her.

01:05:37.287 --> 01:05:39.517
Just look at her. Please.

01:05:39.607 --> 01:05:42.326
I won't be badgered by you a moment longer.

01:05:42.927 --> 01:05:44.918
Do you recognise this?

01:05:48.367 --> 01:05:50.358
Where did you get this?

01:05:50.727 --> 01:05:56.324
I know you've been hurt, but it's just possible
she's been as lost and alone as you.

01:05:57.647 --> 01:06:00.400
You'll stop at nothing, will you?

01:06:01.247 --> 01:06:04.637
I'm probably about as stubborn as you are.

01:06:11.967 --> 01:06:13.958
Go away, Dimitri.

01:06:24.367 --> 01:06:26.756
I'm sorry, I thought you were...

01:06:26.847 --> 01:06:30.840
I know very well who you thought I was.
Who exactly are you?

01:06:32.567 --> 01:06:34.558
I was hoping you could tell me.

01:06:34.887 --> 01:06:37.037
My dear, I'm old.

01:06:37.127 --> 01:06:40.324
And I'm tired of being conned and tricked.

01:06:41.047 --> 01:06:43.322
I don't want to trick you.

01:06:43.407 --> 01:06:47.286
And I suppose the money
doesn't interest you, either?

01:06:48.967 --> 01:06:50.958
I just want to know who I am.

01:06:51.567 --> 01:06:54.639
Whether or not I belong to a family.

01:06:54.727 --> 01:06:56.718
Your family.

01:07:00.607 --> 01:07:03.565
You're a very good actress.
The best yet, in fact.

01:07:03.647 --> 01:07:05.922
But I've had enough.

01:07:10.007 --> 01:07:12.760
- Peppermint?
- An oil for my hands.

01:07:13.407 --> 01:07:15.398
Yes.

01:07:15.487 --> 01:07:17.478
And I spilled a bottle.

01:07:18.167 --> 01:07:22.638
The carpet was soaked
and it forever smelled of peppermint.

01:07:23.367 --> 01:07:25.198
Like you.

01:07:27.247 --> 01:07:31.240
I used to lie there on that rug and
how I missed you when you went away.

01:07:32.447 --> 01:07:35.484
When you came here, to Paris.

01:07:41.287 --> 01:07:43.278
What is that?

01:07:43.367 --> 01:07:47.918
This? Well, I've always had it,
ever since before I can remember.

01:07:48.367 --> 01:07:50.358
May I?

01:07:54.727 --> 01:07:56.718
It was our secret.

01:07:57.727 --> 01:08:00.241
My Anastasia's and mine.

01:08:05.927 --> 01:08:07.918
The music box.

01:08:09.487 --> 01:08:12.797
To sing me to sleep when you were in Paris.

01:08:23.647 --> 01:08:28.595
Hear this song and remember

01:08:29.647 --> 01:08:32.207
Soon you'll be

01:08:32.926 --> 01:08:35.487
Home with me

01:08:35.966 --> 01:08:41.678
Once upon a December

01:08:43.407 --> 01:08:45.398
Oh, Anastasia!

01:08:46.487 --> 01:08:48.478
My Anastasia.

01:09:06.607 --> 01:09:09.167
Bartok, get me a comb.

01:09:09.247 --> 01:09:12.398
Find some cologne. I want to look my best.

01:09:12.487 --> 01:09:17.356
- That might take some work, sir.
- Then snap to it. We're going to a party.

01:09:17.447 --> 01:09:19.881
- A party in Paris?
- That's right.

01:09:19.966 --> 01:09:23.642
I could teach you the latest dance step.
It starts with a...

01:09:23.727 --> 01:09:27.720
And then you get really crazy
with the hips, sir. It's fun.

01:09:27.807 --> 01:09:31.322
We'll let the Grand Duchess Anastasia
have her moment.

01:09:31.407 --> 01:09:34.843
- Who cares?
- And then we'll kill her.

01:09:34.926 --> 01:09:39.238
Right, and then... kill her?
Sir, what happened to the party idea?

01:09:39.327 --> 01:09:43.923
That's where we'll kill her.
Crush her at the height of her glory.

01:09:44.607 --> 01:09:46.598
And we're back with the crushing.

01:09:47.006 --> 01:09:53.002
Sir, I'm begging you. Please.
Please, forget the girl and get a life.

01:09:53.087 --> 01:09:56.124
Oh, I'll get a life, Bartok.

01:09:57.327 --> 01:09:59.318
Hers!

01:10:10.527 --> 01:10:13.724
I remember now how much I loved them.

01:10:13.807 --> 01:10:19.564
They would not want us to live in the past,
not now that we have found each other.

01:10:21.647 --> 01:10:25.117
Look here. The drawing you gave me.

01:10:26.007 --> 01:10:27.998
Remember?

01:10:28.247 --> 01:10:30.966
Yes. Olga made me so mad.

01:10:31.047 --> 01:10:34.244
She said it looked like a pig riding a donkey.

01:10:34.327 --> 01:10:36.477
- She was right.
- In your laughter,

01:10:36.567 --> 01:10:41.482
once again I hear my Nicky, your dear father.

01:10:46.727 --> 01:10:51.437
But you have the beauty of your mother,
Alexandra,

01:10:52.007 --> 01:10:54.237
Empress of all Russia.

01:11:21.207 --> 01:11:23.243
You sent for me, Your Grace?

01:11:23.327 --> 01:11:27.684
10 million roubles, as promised,
with my gratitude.

01:11:28.407 --> 01:11:32.844
I accept your gratitude, Your Highness.
But I don't want the money.

01:11:32.927 --> 01:11:35.043
What do you want, then?

01:11:36.047 --> 01:11:38.515
Unfortunately, nothing you can give.

01:11:41.567 --> 01:11:45.526
Young man,
where did you get that music box?

01:11:47.327 --> 01:11:51.286
You were the boy, weren't you?
The servant boy who got us out.

01:11:52.367 --> 01:11:56.838
You saved her life, and mine,
then you restored her to me.

01:11:57.887 --> 01:12:00.560
Yet you want no reward?

01:12:00.647 --> 01:12:02.046
Not any more.

01:12:02.127 --> 01:12:04.595
Why the change of mind?

01:12:04.687 --> 01:12:07.155
It was more a change of heart.

01:12:08.527 --> 01:12:10.518
I must go.

01:12:26.847 --> 01:12:28.838
Hello, Dimitri.

01:12:29.167 --> 01:12:31.761
- Hello.
- Did you collect your reward?

01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:33.838
My business is complete.

01:12:33.927 --> 01:12:38.796
Young man, you will bow and address
the Princess as "Your Highness".

01:12:38.887 --> 01:12:41.082
- No, that's not necessary.
- Please...

01:12:41.167 --> 01:12:44.477
Your Highness. I'm glad you found
what you were looking for.

01:12:45.127 --> 01:12:47.357
Yes, I'm glad you did, too.

01:12:48.367 --> 01:12:51.677
Well, then. Goodbye, Your Highness.

01:12:59.727 --> 01:13:01.718
Goodbye.

01:13:10.167 --> 01:13:12.681
You look fabulous!

01:13:15.727 --> 01:13:18.719
Do you mind? No, of course not.
You're a wonderful dog.

01:13:22.607 --> 01:13:26.361
Well, if you're ever in St Petersburg again,
look me up.

01:13:27.807 --> 01:13:29.798
So long, Vlad.

01:13:31.287 --> 01:13:33.517
Ah, my boy...

01:13:34.967 --> 01:13:37.765
- You're making a mistake.
- Trust me,

01:13:37.847 --> 01:13:40.964
this is the one thing I'm doing right.

01:13:44.887 --> 01:13:46.320
So long, mutt.

01:13:48.687 --> 01:13:51.121
I can't stay. I don't belong here.

01:14:03.167 --> 01:14:06.762
- He's not there.
- Oh, I know he's not here.

01:14:06.847 --> 01:14:10.396
- Who's not there, Grandmamma?
- A remarkable young man

01:14:10.487 --> 01:14:12.682
who found a music box.

01:14:12.767 --> 01:14:17.158
Well, he's probably too busy spending
his reward money as fast as he can.

01:14:18.887 --> 01:14:20.525
Look at them dance.

01:14:21.767 --> 01:14:26.238
You were born into this world
of glittering jewels and fine titles.

01:14:26.327 --> 01:14:31.355
But I wonder if this is what you really want.

01:14:31.447 --> 01:14:35.520
Of course. Of course it is.
I found what I was looking for.

01:14:35.607 --> 01:14:37.598
I found out who I am.

01:14:38.327 --> 01:14:40.318
I found you.

01:14:41.167 --> 01:14:43.158
Yes, you did find me.

01:14:43.247 --> 01:14:45.522
And you'll always have me.

01:14:46.487 --> 01:14:48.478
But is it enough?

01:14:50.447 --> 01:14:52.438
My darling...

01:14:54.607 --> 01:14:58.156
- He didn't take the money.
- He didn't?

01:14:58.247 --> 01:15:03.196
Knowing that you are alive,
seeing the woman you have become,

01:15:03.287 --> 01:15:06.802
brings me joy I never thought
I could feel again.

01:15:13.447 --> 01:15:15.642
Whatever you choose,

01:15:16.327 --> 01:15:18.602
we will always have each other.

01:15:20.447 --> 01:15:22.836
Grandmamma, can't you tell me the...

01:15:40.847 --> 01:15:42.758
Pooka?

01:15:47.847 --> 01:15:49.838
Pooka?

01:15:55.087 --> 01:15:57.078
Pooka.

01:16:07.367 --> 01:16:10.040
- Voilà.
- You're next.

01:16:23.167 --> 01:16:25.397
Pooka? Here boy.

01:16:31.127 --> 01:16:32.401
There you are.

01:16:32.487 --> 01:16:34.876
Anastasia...

01:16:38.567 --> 01:16:40.922
Anastasia...

01:16:48.847 --> 01:16:50.838
Anastasia.

01:16:52.247 --> 01:16:55.239
Your lmperial Highness.

01:16:55.927 --> 01:16:59.602
Look what ten years has done to us.

01:17:00.247 --> 01:17:02.920
You, a beautiful young flower.

01:17:03.567 --> 01:17:05.558
And me...

01:17:05.647 --> 01:17:09.083
- A rotting corpse.
- That face.

01:17:09.167 --> 01:17:13.080
Last seen at a party like this one.

01:17:13.167 --> 01:17:18.082
- A curse.
- Followed by a tragic night on the ice.

01:17:18.407 --> 01:17:19.806
Remember?

01:17:27.727 --> 01:17:29.718
- Rasputin?
- Rasputin.

01:17:31.287 --> 01:17:35.360
Destroyed by your despicable family!

01:17:35.447 --> 01:17:38.917
But what goes around comes around

01:17:39.007 --> 01:17:42.443
- and around and around and around...
- Stop! No!

01:17:44.487 --> 01:17:48.878
You're on your own, sir.
This can only end in tears.

01:17:51.927 --> 01:17:55.317
- I'm not afraid of you.
- I can fix that!

01:17:56.167 --> 01:17:59.557
Care for a little swim under the ice?

01:18:01.007 --> 01:18:04.124
Say your prayers, Anastasia!

01:18:05.127 --> 01:18:08.517
- No one can save you!
- Wanna bet?

01:18:15.167 --> 01:18:16.236
Dimitri...

01:18:18.367 --> 01:18:21.518
- If we survive, remind me to thank you.
- Thank me later.

01:18:21.607 --> 01:18:23.359
How enchanting.

01:18:23.447 --> 01:18:26.484
Together again - for the last time!

01:18:27.807 --> 01:18:29.365
You'll get a kick out of this.

01:18:35.127 --> 01:18:36.526
No!

01:18:44.367 --> 01:18:45.436
Dimitri!

01:18:46.447 --> 01:18:48.005
Watch out!

01:18:48.687 --> 01:18:52.646
Do svidaniya, Your Highness.

01:18:56.687 --> 01:18:58.325
Hold on!

01:18:58.407 --> 01:19:01.877
Finally, the last Romanov death.

01:19:11.687 --> 01:19:12.597
No!

01:19:12.687 --> 01:19:14.757
Anya!

01:19:15.767 --> 01:19:18.918
Long live the Romanovs!

01:19:19.687 --> 01:19:21.200
Right.

01:19:22.767 --> 01:19:25.042
I couldn't have said it better myself.

01:19:50.047 --> 01:19:52.242
This is for Dimitri.

01:19:53.567 --> 01:19:56.206
- Give it back.
- This is for my family.

01:19:58.207 --> 01:20:02.120
- I'll tear you to pieces.
- And this is for you.

01:20:02.807 --> 01:20:04.684
Do svidaniya.

01:20:42.727 --> 01:20:43.716
Dimitri?

01:20:57.287 --> 01:21:00.518
- Dimitri!
- No, no. Let go. Let go.

01:21:00.607 --> 01:21:03.280
- Sorry.
- Yeah. I know. I know.

01:21:03.367 --> 01:21:05.358
All men are babies.

01:21:08.047 --> 01:21:10.686
- I thought you were going to St Peters...
- I was.

01:21:10.767 --> 01:21:12.803
- You didn't take the...
- I couldn't.

01:21:14.447 --> 01:21:16.836
- Why?
- Because...

01:21:17.287 --> 01:21:19.278
I...

01:21:31.247 --> 01:21:33.238
They're waiting for you.

01:21:49.007 --> 01:21:51.919
Dear Grandmamma, wish me luck.

01:21:52.687 --> 01:21:55.201
We'll be together in Paris again soon.

01:21:56.127 --> 01:21:58.118
A bientôt.

01:21:59.807 --> 01:22:01.798
They've eloped.

01:22:01.887 --> 01:22:03.878
Isn't it romantic?

01:22:05.327 --> 01:22:07.557
It's a perfect ending.

01:22:08.327 --> 01:22:11.205
No. It's a perfect beginning.

01:23:03.047 --> 01:23:04.116
Uh, hello...

01:23:08.647 --> 01:23:09.875
Wow.

01:23:09.967 --> 01:23:11.958
I tell you what... Wow!

01:23:14.287 --> 01:23:16.278
So long, everybody.
