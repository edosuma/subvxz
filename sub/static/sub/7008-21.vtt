WEBVTT

00:03.768 --> 00:07.728
Hey, guys. Got the hot rod outside.
Want to go for a ride?

00:07.839 --> 00:10.468
We'll scare some student drivers, huh?

00:10.975 --> 00:12.034
No, that's okay. Go ahead.

00:12.110 --> 00:14.238
No! Student drivers!
Get up behind them.

00:17.949 --> 00:19.247
What's the matter?

00:19.317 --> 00:21.252
Tell him, Harry.

00:22.487 --> 00:23.978
I can't.

00:24.055 --> 00:28.117
I mean, look at that face.
Poor guy's got no clue.

00:32.997 --> 00:34.898
I've never had a clue.

00:35.767 --> 00:37.827
Come on, guys. What's going on?

00:37.902 --> 00:40.064
Harry's selling the hardware store.

00:40.138 --> 00:43.108
Oh, quick! Get a chair!

00:46.844 --> 00:50.008
Sorry. Where was I?

00:50.081 --> 00:52.854
I thought for a minute I heard you say
you were selling the hardware store.

00:52.884 --> 00:56.821
He is. I've been totally useless
ever since I heard the news.

00:59.090 --> 01:01.252
And for 40 years before that.

01:02.727 --> 01:05.253
Harry, why all of a sudden?

01:05.328 --> 01:06.763
Dolores.

01:07.598 --> 01:08.930
Her asthma's acting up again?

01:09.000 --> 01:12.698
Oh, yeah. She wants to move
to a warmer climate.

01:12.770 --> 01:16.070
Yeah. They're moving to Tucson.
That's in Arizona.

01:21.112 --> 01:24.571
Tucson is Plan A.
Plan B is we stop at a gas station,

01:24.649 --> 01:28.814
she goes in to powder her nose,
and I burn rubber for Vegas.

01:30.054 --> 01:32.819
You can't just leave your wife
in the middle of nowhere.

01:32.890 --> 01:35.951
If we're meant to be together,
she'll find me.

01:37.695 --> 01:39.755
Wait, wait, wait.
You own 20% of the hardware store.

01:39.831 --> 01:41.335
- Why don't you just buy the rest of it?
- I wish.

01:41.365 --> 01:43.129
But I don't have that kind of money.

01:43.234 --> 01:44.338
Unless you want to give me a raise.

01:44.368 --> 01:45.996
I don't think so.

01:46.070 --> 01:48.039
- Well, you got a rich girlfriend.
- Trudy!

01:48.139 --> 01:52.201
I can't ask Trudy. I mean, if I let her
buy the hardware store for me,

01:52.276 --> 01:55.610
I'd feel like I was taking money
for sexual favors.

01:57.582 --> 01:59.346
Wow, I didn't realize Harry's retirement

01:59.417 --> 02:02.785
could send you spiraling
into a life of prostitution.

02:04.188 --> 02:06.748
- Can I speak to you privately?
- Yeah.

02:09.627 --> 02:13.291
This could be a great opportunity.
Listen to me. You could buy the place.

02:13.364 --> 02:16.003
- Get a bank loan. I'll co-sign for you.
- It's not just the money.

02:16.033 --> 02:18.264
There's a lot of things
going on in my life right now.

02:18.336 --> 02:21.465
Like what?
Promoted to head bingo caller?

02:23.207 --> 02:25.870
I wish!

02:25.943 --> 02:29.505
No. The fact is that Trudy and I
are getting pretty serious.

02:29.580 --> 02:33.540
And there might be some
major expenses coming up in my life.

02:34.418 --> 02:36.284
Don't tell anyone! You know, even Jill.

02:36.354 --> 02:39.813
But I'm thinking of making her
the next Mrs. Borland.

02:41.025 --> 02:43.585
You want her to be your mother?

02:44.629 --> 02:46.834
I'm kidding. I'm kidding. It's good news.
It's good news.

02:46.864 --> 02:48.536
But now we really gotta find
a buyer for this place.

02:48.566 --> 02:50.262
And I will do whatever it takes.

02:50.334 --> 02:53.793
Harry, have you had anybody put
a bid in on it or anything like that?

02:53.871 --> 02:56.306
Yeah. A nail salon.

02:58.309 --> 03:01.074
A nail salon? This is the work of Satan.

03:02.413 --> 03:06.509
I can't believe it! Our store is being
turned over to a bunch of women

03:06.584 --> 03:09.349
who sit on their cans and yak all day!

03:11.000 --> 03:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:06.611 --> 04:09.775
Why do you have a brochure
for a motel in Florida?

04:10.348 --> 04:13.250
'Cause a bunch of kids and I
are going down there for spring break.

04:13.317 --> 04:15.582
It's gonna be a week with no parents,
no chaperones

04:15.653 --> 04:17.815
and no tops in the Jacuzzi.

04:19.890 --> 04:22.985
And how did you get Mom and Dad
to agree to this?

04:23.060 --> 04:26.155
Well, that's one detail
I haven't quite figured out.

04:26.230 --> 04:28.597
But I've got a plan.

04:28.666 --> 04:30.100
Hi, guys. How's it going?

04:30.167 --> 04:32.636
You know, it's interesting
you should ask, Mom.

04:32.703 --> 04:34.331
While many young Americans are busy

04:34.405 --> 04:36.499
frittering away their lives
with sex and drugs,

04:36.574 --> 04:40.409
I have remained dedicated
to my studies and athletic pursuits.

04:41.112 --> 04:44.139
You're not going to Florida
on spring break.

04:45.983 --> 04:47.542
How does she know these things?

04:47.618 --> 04:49.678
Your travel agent called.

04:51.856 --> 04:53.188
Oh, man!

04:54.291 --> 04:56.658
Guess what?
Harry is selling the hardware store.

04:56.727 --> 04:59.162
We're gonna save a lot of money.

05:01.465 --> 05:03.957
Hey, now I can actually go to college.

05:05.903 --> 05:08.075
Oh, come on! Harry's always
threatening to sell the store.

05:08.105 --> 05:11.132
This time it's for real.
Dolores's asthma is really acting up

05:11.208 --> 05:12.972
and so they're gonna move to Tucson.

05:13.044 --> 05:14.603
It's in Arizona.

05:15.980 --> 05:17.141
Well, that really is awful.

05:17.248 --> 05:18.819
What's awful is now I have to buy
all my hardware

05:18.849 --> 05:21.011
at one of those big chain stores.

05:21.118 --> 05:24.350
Or you could be happy
with the tools you have.

05:24.422 --> 05:26.448
Fat chance of that.

05:26.524 --> 05:28.356
This is a disturbing trend, though.

05:28.426 --> 05:31.555
This signals the demise
of American small business.

05:31.629 --> 05:35.396
I know. My favorite book store was
bought out by one of those big chains.

05:35.499 --> 05:37.161
Now it's so sterile when you go there.

05:37.234 --> 05:40.568
I used to love to just
be there for hours and browse.

05:40.638 --> 05:42.009
Well, maybe
if you'd bought something,

05:42.039 --> 05:45.134
they wouldn't be going out of business.

05:45.209 --> 05:49.579
Well, there's got to be someone
who'd be interested in taking it over.

05:50.581 --> 05:52.277
Other than you.

05:52.516 --> 05:54.522
Give me one reason why
I shouldn't buy the hardware store.

05:54.552 --> 05:56.316
We have three kids
who have to go to college.

05:56.387 --> 05:58.083
I said one reason.

06:00.291 --> 06:03.056
Come on, Tim. There's gotta be
another buyer out there.

06:03.160 --> 06:06.892
You're a great salesman.
You should be able to find someone.

06:08.099 --> 06:11.866
When we were selling tools,
we used to have these big parties

06:12.503 --> 06:14.665
to soften up potential buyers.

06:14.739 --> 06:17.072
- Did it work?
- You bet! Wild time.

06:17.141 --> 06:19.076
A lot of brown liquor, sexy women.

06:24.048 --> 06:26.017
I just hated those times.

06:29.253 --> 06:32.087
- Tim, this is great!
- Unbelievable! I'm so excited.

06:32.156 --> 06:34.921
All these people are interested
in buying the hardware store!

06:37.661 --> 06:41.325
They all think they're here
for a free meal, all right?

06:43.000 --> 06:44.366
Hey, Rock, what are you drinking?

06:44.468 --> 06:46.198
What am I not drinking?

06:46.270 --> 06:48.899
Hey, Tim. Thank you.
This is really nice.

06:48.973 --> 06:50.711
Usually, when people invite me
over to their house,

06:50.741 --> 06:53.711
it's because they want
to sell me something.

06:54.879 --> 06:57.041
Oh, the weasels. Here.
Let me top that off for you.

06:57.114 --> 06:58.275
Thank you, Tim.

06:58.382 --> 07:01.284
- Dolores, we're really gonna miss you.
- Yes, we are.

07:01.352 --> 07:03.253
I've ignored my asthma for years.

07:03.320 --> 07:06.154
It just keeps getting worse and worse.

07:13.030 --> 07:16.057
Oh, I forgot. Cigar smoke bothers you.

07:19.637 --> 07:23.005
You light that, Harry,
you're sleeping alone tonight.

07:29.613 --> 07:32.481
Hey, your old ball and chain's
looking hot.

07:32.550 --> 07:34.576
- She's a real tomato.
- Yeah.

07:34.652 --> 07:36.678
- I'm a lucky man, Eddie.
- Yeah.

07:36.754 --> 07:40.384
Hey, Jill? Why don't you go flirt
with Eddie a little bit?

07:42.226 --> 07:43.455
Are you insane?

07:43.527 --> 07:47.055
I'm not asking you to do anything.
And your call.

07:50.267 --> 07:52.306
I think it's time for you to tell everybody
why they're here.

07:52.336 --> 07:56.068
All right. Okay, everybody, gather up.
Yeah. All right.

07:56.941 --> 07:59.604
I want to say how happy I am
that you all joined us here tonight.

07:59.677 --> 08:01.509
We are here to celebrate.

08:01.579 --> 08:04.743
- Celebrate what, Tim?
- America!

08:05.382 --> 08:06.543
America, yeah.

08:06.684 --> 08:10.621
Hey, if you're organizing
a secret militia, Timmy, count me in.

08:12.456 --> 08:16.393
No. I'm here to try to save
a small business.

08:16.460 --> 08:17.621
Ladies and gentlemen,

08:17.695 --> 08:19.789
Harry's Hardware is
going out of business.

08:19.864 --> 08:22.026
Oh, no. When did that happen?

08:22.099 --> 08:24.330
I've been taken over by a nail salon

08:24.401 --> 08:26.370
and forced to live
in the desert with my wife.

08:26.470 --> 08:27.836
Oh, no!

08:29.607 --> 08:31.769
And now we'll all have to
buy our hardware

08:31.842 --> 08:33.868
at one of those big faceless chains

08:33.943 --> 08:36.072
instead of a friendly place like Harry's.

08:36.914 --> 08:41.352
I got you.
We're calling our unit "Harry's."

08:41.784 --> 08:44.083
I know where we can get guns.

08:45.523 --> 08:47.856
Now, come on, everybody.

08:48.592 --> 08:52.051
Don't you... We don't want
to lose our hardware store now, do we?

08:52.129 --> 08:53.701
- No!
- That's right. We're not just gonna

08:53.731 --> 08:54.969
stand here and let this happen,
are we?

08:54.999 --> 08:55.999
- No!
- No, we're not!

08:56.066 --> 08:58.331
So, who's gonna step up
and buy this Harry's Hardware?

08:58.402 --> 09:00.496
- Yeah!
- What?

09:00.571 --> 09:01.903
Anybody?

09:03.040 --> 09:05.703
Tim, look, we all love to shop there.

09:05.776 --> 09:08.109
But it just doesn't make sense
to buy the place.

09:08.178 --> 09:10.841
Look, you can't compete
with the large discount stores.

09:10.915 --> 09:13.180
It's a great opportunity.
Harry's has a good location.

09:13.250 --> 09:14.809
He's an institution in this town.

09:14.919 --> 09:17.458
- Then, how come you don't buy it?
- Yeah! How come you don't buy it?

09:17.488 --> 09:20.720
I think The Tool Man is afraid
to put his money where his mouth is!

09:20.791 --> 09:21.850
I am not afraid!

09:21.926 --> 09:23.485
- Then prove it!
- Come on, Timmy.

09:23.560 --> 09:25.432
- Prove it!
- I don't have to prove it. Prove what?

09:25.462 --> 09:27.434
- Prove it! Prove it!
- All right! I'll buy the place!

09:27.464 --> 09:28.830
Yeah!

09:37.741 --> 09:40.210
I think it's great you're
buying the hardware store, Tim.

09:40.277 --> 09:42.508
Hey, congratulations, Jill.

09:45.449 --> 09:48.214
- We gotta talk.
- We're at a party. Not now.

09:48.285 --> 09:49.423
We have talked about this already.

09:49.453 --> 09:51.091
There's no way
that you can buy a business.

09:51.121 --> 09:52.680
We don't know that.

09:52.790 --> 09:53.994
I don't even know
what I paid for the place.

09:54.024 --> 09:55.429
Harry, what did I pay for the place?

09:55.459 --> 09:58.327
- Eighty thousand dollars.
- Eighty thousand dollars?

09:58.395 --> 10:01.160
The nail salon talked you down to 70.

10:01.332 --> 10:03.995
Oh, yeah.

10:04.201 --> 10:06.636
Honey, we just can't shell out
that kind of money.

10:06.704 --> 10:09.538
Listen, listen, listen.
What if I carried the loan?

10:09.607 --> 10:11.111
That way you don't have to
make a down payment.

10:11.141 --> 10:12.632
You can make monthly payments.

10:12.710 --> 10:15.475
And then if it works out,
you can give me the rest later.

10:15.579 --> 10:17.810
Why didn't you make that deal to me?

10:17.881 --> 10:20.646
All right. I'll offer you the same thing.

10:20.851 --> 10:23.480
I'll pass. But thanks for asking.

10:27.191 --> 10:31.128
See? The way he puts it,
it makes it a win-win situation for us.

10:31.195 --> 10:32.823
Just try it a couple of months.

10:32.896 --> 10:36.060
Then if you want to bail,
I'll sell it to the nail salon.

10:36.133 --> 10:38.295
Look, why don't you guys talk it over

10:38.369 --> 10:40.804
while I feed Harry
something fatty and salty?

10:42.873 --> 10:44.345
- Honey, just...
- Honey, look, even if we can make

10:44.375 --> 10:45.946
the monthly payments, I mean,
you've already got a job.

10:45.976 --> 10:47.342
How are you gonna run a business?

10:47.411 --> 10:49.710
Al. Al's 20% owner.
So, he'd work part-time.

10:49.780 --> 10:52.147
Then I'd work part-time. And...

10:52.916 --> 10:56.080
Marty! Have him work full-time.
He needs a job anyway.

10:56.186 --> 10:58.451
I don't know.
It's still a huge undertaking.

10:58.522 --> 11:00.081
I really want to give it a shot.

11:00.190 --> 11:03.888
It's not for me, it's for every guy
out there with a dream.

11:11.869 --> 11:15.772
I don't think every guy out there has
the same dream, Tim.

11:18.008 --> 11:21.570
This saw's $12 cheaper at Tool Mart.
Why should I buy it here?

11:21.645 --> 11:24.410
- We deliver.
- But I'm already here.

11:26.850 --> 11:29.410
All right, I'll tell you what.
I'll knock off a buck.

11:29.520 --> 11:31.455
A buck? You gotta be kidding!

11:31.522 --> 11:33.684
Look, I got customers waiting,
you know?

11:33.757 --> 11:36.818
If Tool Mart is so much cheaper,
go shop there.

11:36.894 --> 11:38.226
Good idea!

11:38.295 --> 11:41.629
Wait, hold it...
Great sales technique, Marty.

11:44.401 --> 11:47.860
I'm sorry, Tim.
I guess I'm not a very good salesman.

11:47.938 --> 11:50.844
It's not just you. We haven't done any
better with Al and I behind the counter.

11:50.874 --> 11:52.114
I don't know how Harry does it.

11:52.176 --> 11:55.476
I mean, it's impossible
to move merchandise at these prices.

11:55.713 --> 11:57.272
I have a theory.

11:57.581 --> 12:01.541
Let me guess.
Harry had a better selection of donuts.

12:01.685 --> 12:05.178
- Yes. But that's not my point.
- What is your point, Benny?

12:05.255 --> 12:07.815
Well, people had
a long-standing relationship with Harry,

12:07.891 --> 12:09.757
so they were willing to pay more.

12:09.827 --> 12:14.731
Once Harry left, people didn't have to
feel guilty about switching to Tool Mart.

12:14.832 --> 12:17.734
I never thought I'd say this.
Benny's right.

12:19.503 --> 12:23.372
I know I'm right. I bought a faucet
at Tool Mart this morning.

12:24.007 --> 12:25.942
Saved myself a bundle.

12:29.179 --> 12:30.909
I gotta hand it to you, Tim.

12:30.981 --> 12:34.008
I mean, this is the worst investment
you ever could have made.

12:34.084 --> 12:36.519
Way to problem-solve, Marty.

12:36.753 --> 12:38.813
Well, hi-ho, tool Taylors.

12:39.857 --> 12:41.018
Morning, Wilson.

12:41.125 --> 12:42.663
Always nice to see
your face around here.

12:42.693 --> 12:44.252
Well, thank you, Tim.

12:44.361 --> 12:48.628
- What can we do for you, Wilson?
- Well, I stopped by to buy a few things.

12:48.699 --> 12:51.726
- Stuff's a lot cheaper at Tool Mart.
- Marty!

12:53.337 --> 12:55.670
Man, I stink at this!

12:55.739 --> 12:57.144
Oh, I would never shop at Tool Mart.

12:57.174 --> 12:58.479
I'd rather spend a little bit more

12:58.509 --> 13:01.274
and come down and get
personal service from Harry's.

13:01.378 --> 13:04.246
I wish everybody felt
the same way you feel.

13:04.314 --> 13:05.680
Business not going so good?

13:05.749 --> 13:07.588
Well, let's put it this way,
the next time you come in here,

13:07.618 --> 13:10.588
you'll be getting a pedicure
and a bikini wax.

13:13.123 --> 13:15.683
Well, I did get myself a new Speedo.

13:17.694 --> 13:21.028
Wilson, we're not making any money.
What did Harry have that we don't?

13:21.098 --> 13:22.657
Well, people trusted Harry.

13:22.733 --> 13:25.038
He was the kind of guy
who stood behind everything he sold.

13:25.068 --> 13:27.128
He'd do anything for a customer.

13:27.204 --> 13:29.173
- I'm that kind of guy.
- Well, I know that, Tim.

13:29.239 --> 13:32.004
But I'm not sure everybody else does.

13:32.376 --> 13:34.743
Then, Marty, we gotta get the word out.

13:34.811 --> 13:37.975
I know! We can print up flyers!
Then we can get on our bikes

13:38.048 --> 13:41.314
and we can plaster them
all over the neighborhood!

13:41.785 --> 13:43.014
Yippie-yi-yo-ki-yay!

13:43.087 --> 13:44.953
Marty! Yeah!

13:45.022 --> 13:47.890
And then... Wait a minute...
We'll sell lemonade in the driveway!

13:47.958 --> 13:51.588
And put cards in our spokes that
go like this! We'll have big lollipops!

13:51.662 --> 13:53.290
And then we'll have a puppet show

13:53.363 --> 13:55.002
for all the rest of the kids
in the neighborhood!

13:55.032 --> 13:57.695
What the hell's the matter with you?

14:08.212 --> 14:09.771
We did that to prove a point.

14:09.847 --> 14:12.749
That in the wrong hands,
even water is flammable.

14:12.816 --> 14:14.154
That's right. And we'll be right back

14:14.184 --> 14:16.153
after these important
commercial messages.

14:22.826 --> 14:25.193
Hi, I'm Tim Taylor.
You probably know me from <i>Tool Time.</i>

14:25.262 --> 14:26.466
What you probably don't know is

14:26.496 --> 14:28.829
I'm now the proud new owner
of Harry's Hardware.

14:28.899 --> 14:30.731
Tim, aren't you forgetting something?

14:30.801 --> 14:34.499
Yes. And Al is my silent partner.
Show them how that works.

14:35.939 --> 14:38.033
That's very funny. Well, in the past,

14:38.108 --> 14:40.600
Harry's Hardware has been known
for its personal service.

14:40.677 --> 14:42.115
That's true. Every time I shop there,

14:42.145 --> 14:43.784
people drop whatever they're doing
to help me.

14:43.814 --> 14:46.477
Even the ones that don't work there.

14:46.950 --> 14:49.442
Now that service is
going to get even better.

14:49.519 --> 14:54.617
That's right. We're proud to introduce
Harry's new Video Tool Library.

14:54.958 --> 14:57.052
So, come on down to the store
and borrow a video

14:57.127 --> 15:00.427
for any project you might
be working on, absolutely free!

15:00.497 --> 15:04.059
- Did you say free?
- I said free!

15:04.167 --> 15:05.726
And that's not all.

15:05.802 --> 15:07.641
If you have any questions
about any one of the videos,

15:07.671 --> 15:09.572
you can call us at our
24-hour tool line.

15:09.640 --> 15:12.804
That's right. Tim and I bought these
cell phones for the express purpose of

15:12.876 --> 15:14.435
being there for you!

15:14.544 --> 15:17.878
Al and I are standing by 24 hours a day
to attend to all the questions

15:17.948 --> 15:19.052
of our hardware store customers.

15:19.082 --> 15:22.917
Call us anytime, 24 hours a day,
night or day, day or night!

15:25.789 --> 15:28.418
Harry's on call! No problem too small!

15:28.592 --> 15:32.359
No, Mother. This won't conflict with
square-dancing night.

15:32.629 --> 15:34.188
Harry's Hardware!

15:36.933 --> 15:39.133
Harry's on call. No problem too small.
Hold on a second.

15:39.169 --> 15:40.841
Hold on,
there's a great pay-per-view movie on

15:40.871 --> 15:42.042
and Mom's not home. Can we watch it?

15:42.072 --> 15:44.303
Yeah. Go ahead.

15:44.374 --> 15:47.936
- So, what's this one called again?
<i>- Shakespeare in Lust.</i>

15:51.148 --> 15:55.210
Oh, wow! Queen Elizabeth is played
by Busty Bartholomew.

15:55.352 --> 15:57.184
I love her work.

15:58.689 --> 16:00.594
- And after that, call a licensed plumber.
- Hi, guys.

16:00.624 --> 16:02.115
Thanks a lot. Bye.

16:02.192 --> 16:04.821
Tim, are you not monitoring
what they're watching?

16:04.895 --> 16:08.457
There's some woman on
there wearing a leather thong!

16:09.199 --> 16:11.134
Not anymore.

16:12.169 --> 16:15.503
Guys, finish up this scene
and shut this thing off!

16:15.739 --> 16:17.002
What?

16:18.709 --> 16:20.473
Does everybody know what time it is?

16:20.544 --> 16:22.172
<i>- Tool Time!
- Tool Time!</i>

16:22.245 --> 16:27.582
That's right. Binford Tools is proud to
present Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor!

16:35.859 --> 16:38.624
Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor!

16:42.799 --> 16:45.291
Tim? Al? Where are you guys?

16:46.002 --> 16:48.528
At Harry's hot line, we'd recommend
some oil or grease on that.

16:48.605 --> 16:50.938
Well, how'd you get it in there?

16:51.007 --> 16:52.339
Tim!

17:00.117 --> 17:01.346
Mmm.

17:02.052 --> 17:05.318
Looks like somebody's ready
to come over to Daddy.

17:06.923 --> 17:11.054
Actually, I was thinking of going
downstairs to meet the cable guy.

17:11.261 --> 17:13.594
Well, see if you can't get us
some premium channels.

17:14.765 --> 17:16.996
- Okay.
- Come here.

17:20.737 --> 17:21.829
Ignore it.

17:21.905 --> 17:23.396
Just... I gotta do this.

17:24.007 --> 17:26.977
Okay, Harry's hot line.
No problem too small.

17:27.210 --> 17:30.772
Oh, a blocked toilet.
Yeah, yeah, that's very, very hard.

17:30.881 --> 17:33.441
Don't put drain cleaner in there. No!
That's not a good idea.

17:34.785 --> 17:38.950
Well, you're gonna need a snake
or a crowbar to bust that sucker up.

17:39.623 --> 17:44.357
Huh? Yeah.
What the heck you been eating, sir?

17:49.065 --> 17:50.226
Yeah.

17:50.834 --> 17:52.803
- Okay, where were we?
- Nowhere.

17:52.903 --> 17:53.974
What do you mean "nowhere"?

17:54.004 --> 17:56.371
Well, first of all,
that phone call was really disgusting.

17:56.473 --> 17:57.702
Worse for him.

17:57.774 --> 17:59.936
And second of all,
every time we try to get romantic,

18:00.043 --> 18:01.909
one of your customers calls.

18:01.978 --> 18:03.606
I'm trying to run a business.

18:03.680 --> 18:06.047
Well, the business is just
ruining your whole life.

18:06.149 --> 18:08.482
You haven't slept in weeks.

18:08.552 --> 18:09.623
Well, it's working though.
I've been getting

18:09.653 --> 18:11.058
a lot of new customers in the store.

18:11.088 --> 18:12.818
Yeah. But, honey, at what cost?

18:12.889 --> 18:15.654
The more customers you get,
the harder you have to work.

18:15.759 --> 18:17.330
It's affecting your whole life, you know?

18:17.360 --> 18:20.524
Your family, your work,
your health, my sex life.

18:21.898 --> 18:24.629
You're not thinking of calling Eddie,
are you?

18:24.701 --> 18:26.863
No. It's his turn to call me.

18:29.239 --> 18:31.105
I am so tired.

18:31.174 --> 18:33.246
Maybe it was a dumb idea for me
buying this hardware store.

18:33.276 --> 18:36.337
No. It wasn't a dumb idea.

18:36.546 --> 18:38.981
You bought it because
you're just a passionate person.

18:39.049 --> 18:40.153
That's what I love about you.

18:40.183 --> 18:43.711
Yeah, I know. But my passion's starting
to get in the way of our passion.

18:43.787 --> 18:45.025
And I really love this hardware store,

18:45.055 --> 18:48.423
but I don't know if it's worth
giving up everything.

18:49.059 --> 18:50.897
Well, you know,
you don't have to decide tonight.

18:50.927 --> 18:53.487
You can sleep on it
and decide in the morning.

18:53.597 --> 18:57.830
- I don't feel like sleeping.
- Oh, good.

18:57.901 --> 19:01.770
- I feel like waxing the hot rod.
- I don't think so, Tim.

19:03.673 --> 19:06.802
- Good morning, Marty.
- Hey, Tim. Business was great today.

19:06.977 --> 19:10.470
That's good. Pack your things up.
I'm gonna sell to the nail salon.

19:10.847 --> 19:13.612
What are you talking about?
You mean I don't have a job anymore?

19:13.717 --> 19:16.983
Depends how good you are
with an emery board.

19:17.520 --> 19:18.886
- Hey, Tim.
- Hey, Jeff.

19:18.955 --> 19:20.446
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

19:20.524 --> 19:22.220
Oh, I just came in
to get some keys made

19:22.292 --> 19:23.864
and Marty asked me to
take a look at the books.

19:23.894 --> 19:26.523
Don't bother, Jeff.
I'll tell you the ending.

19:26.596 --> 19:27.859
He's shutting down Harry's.

19:27.931 --> 19:31.095
Really? Gee. Last week was the store's
best grossing week of the year.

19:31.168 --> 19:32.192
It was?

19:32.269 --> 19:35.364
I think this calls for a celebration.
Free keys.

19:37.340 --> 19:39.613
Well, take all the keys you want.
I'm still gonna sell the shop.

19:39.643 --> 19:41.305
Oh, come on! Why?

19:41.378 --> 19:44.473
Because I don't want my wife
dating Eddie!

19:44.547 --> 19:48.177
That's not a problem.
Eddie's dating somebody else's wife.

19:49.152 --> 19:51.712
Marty, I'm just not getting any sleep.
I'm working too much here.

19:51.788 --> 19:53.848
Twenty-four-hour hot line's
pretty exhausting, huh?

19:53.924 --> 19:57.884
Oh, by the way, thanks
for talking me through that toilet clog.

20:00.530 --> 20:02.590
I can't believe the dream is over.

20:02.666 --> 20:04.498
- It doesn't have to be.
- How's that?

20:04.568 --> 20:06.573
Look, you've already got
people coming in the store.

20:06.603 --> 20:08.909
They know who you are. Maybe
you can cut back on the hot line hours.

20:08.939 --> 20:10.477
Even if I cut back on the hot line hours,

20:10.507 --> 20:12.806
it's just, the workload's
too much for me to handle.

20:12.876 --> 20:15.436
Well, I might be interested in
coming in as a partner.

20:15.545 --> 20:19.380
Yeah. You know, I think I could spend
a few hours in the store every week.

20:19.449 --> 20:20.974
- You?
- Yeah. Of course.

20:21.051 --> 20:23.418
I think this is a good investment.

20:23.553 --> 20:25.522
There's a kiss of death.

20:25.989 --> 20:27.321
Well, thank you for that.

20:27.390 --> 20:29.359
I've saved a few bucks. And, you know,

20:29.426 --> 20:32.453
when Marty here gets back on his feet
in 20 or 30 years,

20:32.529 --> 20:34.828
maybe he'll want to come in, too.

20:34.898 --> 20:36.202
- What do you think?
- Wait, wait.

20:36.232 --> 20:37.270
You're serious about this?

20:37.300 --> 20:38.838
- Yeah.
- Yes, it is. This might be the first time

20:38.868 --> 20:42.100
we've ever done something together
that was productive.

20:42.172 --> 20:46.337
No. No. Remember that time we dug
that really giant hole in the back yard?

20:46.409 --> 20:47.877
Oh, yeah.

20:48.545 --> 20:50.411
Oh, yeah. I was so excited

20:50.513 --> 20:53.278
that my big brothers were letting me
hang out with them finally.

20:53.383 --> 20:57.445
I found out we were digging
that hole so you could stick me in it.

20:57.520 --> 20:59.926
Just think what we could do with a
whole store full of shovels.

20:59.956 --> 21:01.584
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah. Sure.

21:01.658 --> 21:03.957
I ain't gonna fall for that one anymore.

21:04.027 --> 21:06.792
You're gonna have to
find somebody else.

21:10.667 --> 21:12.101
What are you looking at?

21:12.168 --> 21:13.727
Somebody else.

21:17.774 --> 21:19.037
For the millionth time,

21:19.109 --> 21:21.135
you are not going to Florida
on spring break.

21:21.211 --> 21:22.415
But, Mom, will you hear me out?

21:22.445 --> 21:24.818
All right. A lot of the parents shared
your concerns, all right?

21:24.848 --> 21:26.578
Now we have five chaperones going.

21:26.650 --> 21:29.256
The boys are staying in one hotel
and the girls are staying in another.

21:29.286 --> 21:31.016
We're gonna be supervised
24 hours a day.

21:31.087 --> 21:33.955
And I promise,
we can't go anywhere alone.

21:34.023 --> 21:36.117
So, why do you want to go?

21:38.728 --> 21:40.856
I don't think I do anymore.

21:46.302 --> 21:49.272
We did that to... We just did that.

21:52.008 --> 21:53.032
<i>Four, three...</i>

21:53.109 --> 21:56.273
- Absolutely free!
- Did you say free?

21:57.881 --> 22:00.112
Oh, yes, I did!

22:01.217 --> 22:03.709
Listen, I know, we can print up some...

22:10.860 --> 22:12.988
Yeah. They're moving to Arizona.

22:13.063 --> 22:15.623
- That's in Tucson, you know?
- I know.
