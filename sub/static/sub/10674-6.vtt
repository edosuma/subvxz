WEBVTT

00:00.027 --> 00:02.106
- Previously on Underground...
- You were right.

00:02.133 --> 00:03.182
I ain't made for running.

00:03.217 --> 00:04.467
Will you tell Noah for me?

00:04.469 --> 00:05.968
You want to help,
you think on that song.

00:06.020 --> 00:07.136
Yeah.

00:07.188 --> 00:08.938
It speaks of the wolf who will

00:08.973 --> 00:10.389
drag you into the underworld.

00:10.441 --> 00:11.607
She's just a simple girl.

00:11.642 --> 00:13.142
I see what kind of trouble Rosalee is.

00:13.144 --> 00:14.360
Run!

00:14.395 --> 00:16.145
This whole mess cannot
have come at a worse time

00:16.146 --> 00:18.697
for my campaign, especially
with the reverend arriving soon.

00:18.733 --> 00:20.399
You sold my wife.

00:20.451 --> 00:22.735
The worst day
of that man's life was just

00:22.787 --> 00:24.453
another Tuesday at the office for me.

00:24.489 --> 00:25.654
You made a mistake.

00:25.706 --> 00:28.624
But God has given us
the opportunity to fix that now.

00:28.659 --> 00:31.260
Dear Mr. Still,

00:31.295 --> 00:33.662
thank you for your last letter.

00:33.714 --> 00:36.215
It gives John and I great joy
to know your business

00:36.250 --> 00:40.219
in Philadelphia is thriving.
Our lives here are filled

00:40.254 --> 00:43.651
with excitement as well.
I am pleased to report

00:43.687 --> 00:45.841
in the last three weeks, our new nursery

00:45.843 --> 00:49.762
has come along nicely.
John and I have a strong vision

00:49.814 --> 00:51.680
of what to do with the space.

00:52.623 --> 00:55.568
Of course, one never knows
just how small a room can be

00:55.603 --> 00:57.903
until you find a big purpose for it.

01:00.622 --> 01:02.191
We pray to God
that one day soon, this room

01:02.193 --> 01:04.964
is put to full use within
that beautiful purpose.

01:05.324 --> 01:08.864
When it is, one worries
if it will be enough.

01:10.952 --> 01:12.701
It's daunting to think
how much is involved

01:12.703 --> 01:14.833
in caring for another human being.

01:15.820 --> 01:17.289
But we try to anticipate.

01:17.864 --> 01:19.792
To open our hearts.

01:20.292 --> 01:22.357
To prepare for the arrival
of a new soul.

01:24.496 --> 01:25.714
So much is unknown.

01:26.400 --> 01:27.383
Who will they be?

01:27.920 --> 01:29.468
How will they challenge us?

01:29.902 --> 01:31.638
What struggles will they face?

01:32.614 --> 01:35.724
Perhaps there's no way to truly
prepare, and that's scary.

01:36.726 --> 01:39.645
But that is not why we do it,
I suppose, for it to be easy.

01:41.317 --> 01:42.281
We do it because we are compelled

01:42.316 --> 01:44.817
to build a safe world for those we love.

01:45.366 --> 01:46.952
And because of the joy
we'll feel in giving another

01:46.988 --> 01:49.154
a happy and healthy life.

01:52.625 --> 01:54.890
I look forward to your next
correspondence.

01:55.129 --> 01:57.331
It means all the world to me.

01:57.878 --> 02:00.122
Sincerely, Elizabeth.

03:17.011 --> 03:18.377
You writing your ma?

03:18.991 --> 03:19.662
Yes, sir.

03:20.464 --> 03:21.413
Good things?

03:33.889 --> 03:35.769
Do you think we'll pass a post soon?

03:36.169 --> 03:38.593
Runaways usually steer clear of towns.

03:39.439 --> 03:40.816
We're following along the river.

03:41.343 --> 03:43.352
We'll catch 'em soon enough.

04:29.450 --> 04:30.816
He's got a shotgun!

04:31.176 --> 04:32.243
Run!

04:48.786 --> 04:50.419
We lost him.

04:50.471 --> 04:52.171
What happened?

04:52.223 --> 04:54.089
You trying to get us killed? Huh?

04:54.091 --> 04:56.925
Hey, hey.
What the hell is wrong with you?

04:56.977 --> 04:58.060
Going off by yourself?

04:58.095 --> 04:59.144
I was trying to get us some food.

04:59.180 --> 05:00.479
By begging a white man?

05:00.514 --> 05:01.897
I checked him out
'fore I went to his door.

05:01.932 --> 05:03.766
We got enough problems
with that catcher doggin'

05:03.768 --> 05:06.151
our every step. We don't
need no more attention.

05:06.187 --> 05:08.270
Man, all I can think about is food.

05:08.322 --> 05:11.190
We've had nothing to eat
for weeks. I'm so hungry...

05:11.242 --> 05:13.776
Hey, we all hungry.
And thirsty. And tired.

05:13.828 --> 05:15.744
But you whining about it
don't help nothing.

05:15.780 --> 05:17.329
We ain't gonna make it like this.

05:17.364 --> 05:19.248
We going in the right direction.

05:19.283 --> 05:20.999
No, we been following
this drinking gourd

05:21.035 --> 05:22.418
and this blue haze.

05:22.453 --> 05:24.271
We ain't seen no sign of no wolf.

05:25.184 --> 05:26.088
Maybe the song ain't the way.

05:26.123 --> 05:28.411
Hey, you want to go back, then go.

05:29.071 --> 05:30.386
Ain't nobody gonna stop you.

05:36.027 --> 05:37.132
Y'all hear that?

05:42.275 --> 05:45.140
It's a boat. Maybe...
maybe they got something to eat.

05:45.142 --> 05:46.475
A shotgun in your face
ain't enough to teach you

05:46.477 --> 05:47.893
the white folks
ain't gonna give you nothing?

05:47.945 --> 05:49.394
Then we take it.

05:51.482 --> 05:52.781
We can't attack 'em.

05:52.817 --> 05:54.566
She right... we only got one bullet.

05:54.618 --> 05:55.651
They don't know that.

05:55.676 --> 05:57.369
No, I mean, they ain't
done nothing to us.

05:57.404 --> 05:58.537
You got to harden up, house girl.

05:58.572 --> 05:59.538
You said it yourself...

05:59.573 --> 06:00.956
we can't last like this.

06:05.452 --> 06:06.662
Noah.

06:09.201 --> 06:10.874
We ain't got nothing left to lose.

06:11.226 --> 06:12.900
It's us or them.

07:07.725 --> 07:10.309
It's not so much about
faith as it is fervor.

07:10.361 --> 07:12.444
I heard a New York senate candidate

07:12.479 --> 07:13.695
is a Quaker.

07:13.731 --> 07:16.031
Quaker's not a religion.
It's a philosophy.

07:16.562 --> 07:19.735
They, uh, they have, uh,
meetings instead of worship.

07:20.244 --> 07:22.237
It's blasphemy
to hear them speak of God.

07:23.715 --> 07:25.380
The lighting in here

07:25.949 --> 07:27.049
- is perfect.
- Mm-hmm.

07:27.051 --> 07:28.433
If you would be so...

07:28.469 --> 07:30.844
so gracious as to lend your office.

07:31.188 --> 07:33.722
I-I'll have the desk

07:33.774 --> 07:35.223
removed right away.

07:35.459 --> 07:37.539
P-Please, Reverend, sit.

07:39.414 --> 07:40.395
Ah.

07:43.734 --> 07:45.283
Oh, not now.

07:45.319 --> 07:47.869
I see that you are

07:47.905 --> 07:49.988
an avid reader of the Word.

07:50.248 --> 07:53.388
Yes, I-I try to read passages
to the family every Sunday.

07:53.677 --> 07:54.910
I do... I want to be a moral leader

07:54.912 --> 07:56.244
as much as a political one.

07:56.246 --> 07:58.830
Goddamn it, get it out!

08:01.585 --> 08:02.751
And your slaves?

08:02.753 --> 08:05.456
Do you read from the
Good Book to them as well?

08:06.684 --> 08:07.472
From time to time.

08:07.508 --> 08:09.307
Time to time. Perhaps if you had

08:10.180 --> 08:10.726
a few more times,

08:10.761 --> 08:12.516
seven of 'em wouldn't have run away.

08:15.732 --> 08:17.131
You want to be a moral leader?

08:18.731 --> 08:20.852
That begins...

08:21.756 --> 08:22.688
at home.

08:23.412 --> 08:25.508
I will not rest until it's achieved.

08:26.443 --> 08:29.027
Get your asses off!

08:30.280 --> 08:31.580
Do what he says!

08:33.200 --> 08:34.533
Go!

08:37.755 --> 08:39.453
Come here, come here. Come here. No! No.

08:39.506 --> 08:41.789
Show me how you steer this. How you...

08:41.792 --> 08:43.924
Drop your weapons
to the side of the boat!

08:48.235 --> 08:49.214
Your weapon...

08:49.685 --> 08:52.050
to the side of the boat. Come on.

08:54.772 --> 08:57.973
You, inside... get out the cabin, now.

08:59.443 --> 09:00.649
Get out here.

09:02.529 --> 09:03.305
Ben.

09:06.287 --> 09:07.297
They move, shoot 'em.

09:12.990 --> 09:14.539
Now, put 'em on.

09:15.983 --> 09:17.167
Put 'em on.

09:17.828 --> 09:18.949
Slow.

09:20.351 --> 09:21.217
Where's Rosalee?

09:22.776 --> 09:23.692
Where's she at?

09:45.522 --> 09:47.689
Aah!

09:55.332 --> 09:57.699
Take the shot. Take the shot!

09:57.701 --> 09:59.501
She can't swim.

09:59.536 --> 10:01.036
He the only thing keeping her afloat.

10:16.687 --> 10:17.717
No!

10:19.119 --> 10:21.307
Look, there she is!

10:28.532 --> 10:30.565
Aah!

11:36.479 --> 11:38.145
Bitsy. May I come in?

11:38.612 --> 11:39.733
Of course.

11:41.288 --> 11:42.856
You've finished construction?

11:44.280 --> 11:46.144
I've seen the men coming in and out.

11:47.239 --> 11:48.784
We had to pull the floorboards up.

11:49.075 --> 11:50.241
I couldn't get the blood out.

11:51.329 --> 11:53.777
And how have you been, since...

11:54.369 --> 11:55.341
Good.

11:55.690 --> 11:58.699
Bitsy. That's the same "good"
I got after Charles Bradley

11:58.751 --> 12:00.877
told everyone
you showed him your knickers.

12:01.253 --> 12:02.557
You can talk to me.

12:03.873 --> 12:05.964
I've been keeping busy
as not to think about it.

12:07.176 --> 12:08.652
But there have been nightmares.

12:10.422 --> 12:12.629
If there's one place you're
supposed to feel safe,

12:12.681 --> 12:13.492
it's in your own home, right?

12:14.141 --> 12:15.317
You are safe. I have been

12:16.150 --> 12:18.969
- keeping diligent watch.
- Marshal.

12:18.971 --> 12:20.361
To what do we owe the pleasure?

12:20.910 --> 12:23.474
This is not a social visit, I'm afraid.

12:23.526 --> 12:25.309
I'm here on official business.

12:25.361 --> 12:26.674
A visiting tobacco farmer

12:26.710 --> 12:27.977
spotted one of his runaways in town.

12:28.814 --> 12:31.482
He evaded capture and has since
been seen in the area.

12:31.484 --> 12:32.969
We're mounting a search.

12:34.369 --> 12:35.819
You know, in this stretch of the river,

12:35.871 --> 12:37.454
there's not many places to hide.

12:37.490 --> 12:39.073
Just a few abandoned barns

12:39.857 --> 12:40.953
and, uh, your home.

12:43.778 --> 12:45.170
Can you grab your gun?

12:46.259 --> 12:47.393
I don't own a gun.

12:48.619 --> 12:51.001
Federal commissioners
have given us broad authority

12:51.053 --> 12:53.003
to compel any and all citizens

12:53.005 --> 12:54.505
to aid us in our search.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.061
What do you mean by compel?

12:56.850 --> 12:58.225
John Hawkes.

12:58.427 --> 13:00.394
Under the powers
of the Fugitive Slave Act,

13:00.429 --> 13:01.645
I'd like to welcome you

13:01.680 --> 13:03.506
into the service
of the Marshal's office.

13:05.317 --> 13:07.690
God has a plan for all of us.

13:07.911 --> 13:10.357
And if we follow that plan,
it will lead us to salvation.

13:10.711 --> 13:12.451
Massa, the baby's come.

13:12.858 --> 13:13.688
It's a boy.

13:14.059 --> 13:15.359
I knew it.

13:15.411 --> 13:16.184
A blessing.

13:16.612 --> 13:18.600
What shall we call this child?

13:19.657 --> 13:20.860
Hmm. Samuel.

13:21.250 --> 13:22.631
It's a good Christian name.

13:23.202 --> 13:25.452
It takes more than nomenclature
to make a good Christian.

13:25.504 --> 13:28.505
A baptism is the first step
of the faithful.

13:28.541 --> 13:29.807
Of course.

13:29.842 --> 13:31.542
And not just baby Samuel

13:31.544 --> 13:32.960
but all my slaves as well.

13:33.012 --> 13:34.628
I want the whole of the Macon Plantation

13:34.680 --> 13:36.013
be brought closer to God.

13:36.048 --> 13:37.347
Tomorrow's Sunday.

13:37.383 --> 13:40.384
As good a day as any
to be accepted into His grace.

13:40.436 --> 13:42.636
One Lord. One truth.

13:43.351 --> 13:44.822
One baptism.

13:44.857 --> 13:45.968
It shall be done.

13:48.727 --> 13:49.837
Oh, yes.

13:50.311 --> 13:53.141
Pardon, massa,
the river water's still cold.

13:53.482 --> 13:56.283
Might be baby Samuel ain't strong enough

13:56.318 --> 13:57.534
for it yet.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.894
He's plenty strong. He's a Macon.

14:14.987 --> 14:15.702
Pa!

14:16.489 --> 14:17.262
Ain't nothing.

14:20.926 --> 14:22.006
Get my other shirt.

14:25.264 --> 14:27.431
What we gonna do now if
they're in the water?

14:27.433 --> 14:28.534
I broke that rudder.

14:29.185 --> 14:30.741
Means they can't steer the boat.

14:31.570 --> 14:33.783
Means the end of the line's
the next bend in the river.

14:33.808 --> 14:34.701
Come on out!

14:35.297 --> 14:36.461
Don't shoot.

14:37.056 --> 14:38.010
Don't shoot.

14:38.156 --> 14:39.639
I fell off the boat.

14:39.812 --> 14:41.559
You know, I washed down shore.

14:42.326 --> 14:43.902
Got all wet.

14:47.404 --> 14:48.790
I heard y'all talkin'.

14:49.455 --> 14:51.588
You know, I could show you
where the river bends.

14:51.624 --> 14:52.956
There's a tavern that's right near it...

14:52.958 --> 14:54.424
We can find it on our own.

14:54.460 --> 14:55.792
Wait.

14:55.844 --> 14:58.210
No, no, no, no, no. You...
you got to take me with you.

14:58.490 --> 14:59.850
This here's Indian territory.

15:00.172 --> 15:01.750
And I heard about what
they done to captives.

15:01.775 --> 15:03.650
Them cutting off their scalps.

15:04.103 --> 15:05.722
And their other parts.

15:06.882 --> 15:07.889
Please.

15:10.442 --> 15:12.098
We can't just leave her.

15:18.651 --> 15:20.266
She rides with you.

15:20.786 --> 15:23.453
We'll cut through Indian territory,

15:23.489 --> 15:26.378
get to the bend before they run ashore.

15:26.992 --> 15:28.297
Here you go, miss.

15:30.379 --> 15:33.413
Well, aren't you just
my knight in shining armor.

15:45.818 --> 15:47.602
We have no food.

15:47.846 --> 15:48.996
Nothing to drink.

15:49.315 --> 15:50.091
No rudder.

15:52.554 --> 15:54.242
And this boat ain't nothin'
but a floating casket.

15:58.490 --> 15:59.691
How you know how to swim?

16:00.409 --> 16:01.945
Massa taught me.

16:02.361 --> 16:04.861
- He teach all his house slaves?
- No.

16:04.913 --> 16:07.528
Miss Mary was afraid of the water.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.594
Massa threw me in.

16:09.714 --> 16:10.912
Showed her it was safe.

16:11.314 --> 16:12.196
You weren't scared?

16:12.762 --> 16:14.084
No need to be.

16:15.265 --> 16:17.268
Massa was holding me the whole time.

16:17.817 --> 16:19.407
He wasn't gonna let me go.

16:25.804 --> 16:27.140
Ain't no food in here.

16:27.176 --> 16:29.988
Ain't much of anything to wear, either.

16:36.870 --> 16:38.336
The hell's going on?

16:38.371 --> 16:40.755
Underneath is somebody!

16:40.790 --> 16:42.874
Please!

16:42.926 --> 16:44.675
Don't hurt me! Don't hurt me!

16:44.711 --> 16:46.127
What are we gonna do with him?

16:46.129 --> 16:47.295
Toss him overboard!

16:47.347 --> 16:49.380
- Wait-wait-wait! Listen, listen....
- Shut your mouth!

16:49.432 --> 16:51.299
Y'all are runaways, right?
Trying to get north?

16:51.301 --> 16:53.217
I can help. I know a man.

16:53.269 --> 16:54.886
A half-Injun at the
base of the mountains.

16:54.938 --> 16:56.521
He'll help your kind.

16:58.292 --> 17:00.340
He'll... he'll take you to freedom.

17:01.644 --> 17:03.644
If you let me live,
I'll show you the way.

17:03.646 --> 17:04.896
I'll show you the way.

17:05.949 --> 17:07.531
I'll show you the way.

17:09.819 --> 17:11.319
We'll break off into teams of two,

17:11.371 --> 17:13.154
scouring the area north of the river.

17:13.156 --> 17:14.555
Now, we suspect there might be someone

17:14.590 --> 17:16.212
aiding runaways in the area.

17:16.638 --> 17:17.959
We find anyone helping him...

17:17.993 --> 17:20.627
white or black... you know
what we do with their kind.

17:24.122 --> 17:26.834
There's a man out there, scared, alone,

17:26.836 --> 17:29.470
about to fight for his life,
and look at them...

17:29.899 --> 17:30.922
they're excited.

17:30.974 --> 17:33.431
John... you have to.

17:33.810 --> 17:35.643
I don't have to do
anything... if I refuse

17:35.678 --> 17:37.100
and Kyle arrests me, I'll pay the fine.

17:37.347 --> 17:38.905
It'll be well worth it
not to be involved in this.

17:38.907 --> 17:41.005
And it'll only increase his suspicions.

17:41.184 --> 17:42.976
He doesn't have any proof.

17:43.486 --> 17:45.637
I don't think these men need it.

17:47.573 --> 17:48.356
Just show them you're the kind of man

17:48.358 --> 17:50.408
that puts the law above all else.

17:51.116 --> 17:54.996
The last time I did that, I sold
a woman away from her husband.

17:58.476 --> 18:01.168
You didn't tell me you
were having nightmares.

18:02.102 --> 18:04.204
My nightmares and your principles

18:04.257 --> 18:05.623
don't matter anymore.

18:06.253 --> 18:09.343
We have to do whatever it takes
to protect our cargo.

18:12.765 --> 18:13.453
John?

18:14.716 --> 18:16.060
You with us?

18:20.857 --> 18:22.740
So, where are y'all coming from?

18:22.951 --> 18:25.068
Georgia. We're huntin' runaways.

18:25.195 --> 18:27.145
Y'all and everyone else.

18:27.197 --> 18:29.030
I swear, every catcher in the country

18:29.065 --> 18:31.449
come through that tavern talkin'
about that Macon 7 reward.

18:31.484 --> 18:33.367
I even heard Patty Cannon gang's here.

18:33.403 --> 18:35.236
Who's the Patty Cannon gang?

18:35.238 --> 18:36.871
You ain't never heard of Patty Cannon?

18:37.407 --> 18:39.823
She run, like,
a whole outfit of catchers!

18:39.876 --> 18:43.878
Some of them niggers, too, but
they're the best of the best.

18:43.913 --> 18:45.580
How do you know that they're the best?

18:45.582 --> 18:47.748
Well, they always got
the most scratch to pay for...

18:47.750 --> 18:49.467
particulars.

18:49.502 --> 18:50.918
My pa already brought in

18:50.920 --> 18:52.420
two of 'em, and we're gonna get

18:52.472 --> 18:54.305
the rest of 'em down at the river bend.

18:54.340 --> 18:57.091
Was that them that attacked
Miss Dilly's gunboat?

18:58.011 --> 19:00.144
What's wrong?

19:05.351 --> 19:08.352
What the hell is that?

19:29.092 --> 19:30.625
Watch out!

19:30.677 --> 19:33.594
Ben, hush up. Put it away.

20:09.932 --> 20:13.702
First that damn song, now
some magical Indian our savior?

20:13.704 --> 20:14.738
Boy, you want freedom
so bad you're willing

20:14.763 --> 20:16.662
to swallow any tale they feed you.

20:16.697 --> 20:18.865
I done heard about Indians
sheltering people like us.

20:18.917 --> 20:20.574
Yeah, but they own slaves, too,
and the way the white folks

20:20.610 --> 20:22.777
- talk about...
- Same way they talk about us?

20:23.601 --> 20:24.800
I ain't ready to give up yet.

20:25.441 --> 20:26.841
- If there's a chance...
- Ain't nobody gonna help us.

20:26.877 --> 20:28.443
We out here alone, and that's all

20:28.478 --> 20:29.598
we ever been and ever gonna be.

20:29.600 --> 20:30.655
Now we fashion up some weapons,

20:30.690 --> 20:31.972
- fight it out...
- It's a waste of time.

20:31.997 --> 20:33.957
- There's three of us.
- They got guns.

20:34.064 --> 20:35.037
We ain't got no more bullets.

20:35.062 --> 20:37.173
That's because you used
the last one to save her ass.

20:37.201 --> 20:38.733
She can swim us to shore.

20:38.785 --> 20:41.153
We-we just use the whiskey barrels,

20:41.155 --> 20:42.821
and they'll help us

20:42.873 --> 20:43.788
keep us afloat.

20:43.824 --> 20:45.824
House girl ain't strong enough.

20:45.826 --> 20:47.826
- The current'll drag us under.
- She can do it!

20:47.878 --> 20:49.661
Noah... You can do it.

20:49.663 --> 20:50.996
You got to.

20:51.048 --> 20:52.414
Might be this our only hope.

20:52.466 --> 20:53.832
Y'all threatened that man's life.

20:53.884 --> 20:56.301
He gonna say anything to save himself.

20:56.336 --> 20:58.887
- We can't trust what he says.
- You don't have to trust him.

20:58.922 --> 21:01.056
You got to trust me.

21:02.342 --> 21:04.759
I'm gonna get us to freedom.

21:04.811 --> 21:07.646
If we can't find those Indians,
we keep following the song.

21:07.681 --> 21:09.731
You know what I think
about your damn song?

21:09.766 --> 21:11.939
The same thing I think about your girl.

21:11.974 --> 21:13.768
Hell, the same thing
I think about this redneck.

21:13.820 --> 21:15.353
They all useless!

22:06.573 --> 22:08.156
What are you doing?

22:20.833 --> 22:23.098
- Not in the house.
- Ooh, is that my whiskey

22:23.149 --> 22:25.016
- I taste?
- Never in the house.

22:25.069 --> 22:26.402
Later in the wine cellar.

22:26.437 --> 22:28.354
No. Now.

22:28.406 --> 22:31.073
I haven't touched you since
the reverend got here.

22:31.108 --> 22:33.943
I say when, I say where, always.

22:33.995 --> 22:36.075
This is my house, and I make the rules!

22:39.867 --> 22:41.949
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

22:42.001 --> 22:44.253
All right?

22:46.290 --> 22:48.185
I'm sorry.

22:48.221 --> 22:51.427
It's the reverend.

22:51.462 --> 22:53.595
You see, there's no pleasing him.

22:53.631 --> 22:57.049
Nothing I do is working. Please?

22:58.302 --> 23:02.304
Can we just, for a moment, let go?

23:19.540 --> 23:22.157
Stop.

23:25.876 --> 23:27.325
Please.

24:28.893 --> 24:31.727
I talked to a boat captain.

24:31.779 --> 24:33.479
Rained recently.

24:33.531 --> 24:35.898
Based on the current,
he says that the...

24:35.900 --> 24:38.317
boat'll likely...

24:38.369 --> 24:40.953
get here at first light.

24:45.139 --> 24:46.738
I'm gonna grab some shut-eye

24:46.773 --> 24:48.353
before heading out to keep watch.

24:48.660 --> 24:51.411
- That should give you enough time.
- For what?

24:51.413 --> 24:53.046
To get to know each other.

24:53.081 --> 24:54.297
What do I say?

24:55.581 --> 24:56.999
Doesn't matter much what.

24:57.457 --> 24:58.633
As long as you say it with confidence.

24:59.170 --> 25:00.919
Is that how you courted Ma?

25:01.389 --> 25:02.307
With confidence?

25:03.594 --> 25:06.726
Took me a long while to muster
up the courage to speak to her.

25:06.761 --> 25:09.562
Lucky for you, she spoke first.

25:11.049 --> 25:12.565
Here she come.

25:17.155 --> 25:19.322
Hey there, Ben.

25:19.357 --> 25:21.240
What you been up to?

25:30.870 --> 25:32.270
You know, I was thinking
maybe we could take apart

25:32.272 --> 25:34.004
some of those lanterns
that I found in the cabin,

25:34.171 --> 25:35.587
make us some knives.

25:35.623 --> 25:37.005
I have to finish this.

25:37.041 --> 25:40.425
Ain't no way Rosalee gonna
pull us all to shore.

25:40.461 --> 25:43.428
We gonna have to fight. Mr. Cato was...

25:43.464 --> 25:45.297
Damn it, you ain't got
to call him Mr. Cato no more.

25:45.299 --> 25:46.965
We off the plantation.

25:48.969 --> 25:50.886
We don't stand a chance
against them guns.

25:50.938 --> 25:53.555
Pick us off before
we even get off the boat.

25:53.607 --> 25:56.775
You said it. We got nothin' to lose.

26:15.379 --> 26:17.792
You thinkin' of jumpin' ship?

26:19.408 --> 26:22.918
- Thought I saw somethin' in the trees.
- Mmm.

26:25.756 --> 26:27.389
These your first stripes, ain't they?

26:28.182 --> 26:29.807
Master must've

26:29.843 --> 26:32.239
taken a liking to you
to keep you so clean.

26:32.822 --> 26:34.512
That catcher doggin' us,

26:34.515 --> 26:37.566
calling you out by name.
And I think I know why.

26:39.153 --> 26:41.120
Daddy want his little
girl back, don't he?

26:41.605 --> 26:45.073
Oh, you can't swim us to
shore. You can't save us.

26:45.109 --> 26:48.610
That catcher ain't gonna leave
us alone as long as you with us.

26:48.662 --> 26:50.845
You gonna sink us, house girl.

27:43.648 --> 27:45.784
Everybody out there in the fields,

27:45.819 --> 27:48.160
they think they want to be
in the big house.

27:49.808 --> 27:52.674
Closer you are
to the white folks, the better.

27:52.726 --> 27:54.040
Safer.

27:55.714 --> 27:57.011
What they don't know

27:57.064 --> 28:00.552
is that livin' in they world,
it starts to change you.

28:01.880 --> 28:03.720
We start actin' like them.

28:04.496 --> 28:06.600
Do things we never thought we could.

28:09.120 --> 28:10.407
Pearly Mae,

28:11.383 --> 28:12.077
she picked cotton

28:12.112 --> 28:14.279
out in that field all day,

28:14.775 --> 28:16.197
every day,

28:16.250 --> 28:17.904
and I was jealous of her.

28:19.160 --> 28:22.287
The massa own her from sunup to sundown,

28:24.968 --> 28:26.208
but after that, she had her man

28:27.128 --> 28:28.583
and her baby.

28:29.315 --> 28:30.567
She could read.

28:31.932 --> 28:33.824
She could escape.

28:38.496 --> 28:40.850
We don't never get to let go.

28:51.240 --> 28:52.896
I kilt her.

28:58.826 --> 29:00.780
I'd rather be out in that field.

29:03.580 --> 29:06.704
But the house is the only way
I know how to protect 'em.

29:08.634 --> 29:10.009
My babies.

29:11.580 --> 29:13.731
I'd do anything for them.

29:15.723 --> 29:18.844
God have to forgive any sin
for that, don't he?

29:46.206 --> 29:47.789
Oh.

29:48.753 --> 29:49.975
What are you doing here?

29:50.010 --> 29:51.509
You paid for me.

29:51.891 --> 29:53.171
For my boy.

29:55.215 --> 29:57.049
With them Indians.

29:58.943 --> 30:01.553
I ain't never seen
nothin' like that before.

30:02.051 --> 30:03.779
I thought they was gonna kill you.

30:05.461 --> 30:07.058
I have to know what that was.

30:07.110 --> 30:08.643
A tribal ritual.

30:08.695 --> 30:09.895
They got my blood on their spears,

30:09.947 --> 30:11.646
they know I'm not an enemy to be feared.

30:12.126 --> 30:16.902
Well, you sure did
fool them, didn't you?

30:18.319 --> 30:19.933
Go downstairs.

30:20.624 --> 30:22.805
I talked to him like you asked.

30:25.949 --> 30:27.325
He told me about your sick wife.

30:31.013 --> 30:32.300
My momma,

30:32.844 --> 30:36.412
God rest her soul, she was sick
a long time before she passed.

30:37.212 --> 30:39.460
And I was the only one
there to take care of her.

30:43.244 --> 30:45.116
I know the burden...

30:46.285 --> 30:47.933
of that.

30:50.320 --> 30:51.298
And...

30:53.865 --> 30:55.738
the burden

30:56.944 --> 31:02.113
of feelin' like it's a burden
on top of that.

31:04.952 --> 31:07.554
They're bedridden.

31:10.841 --> 31:14.843
But you're the one...

31:14.878 --> 31:17.712
who feels trapped.

31:24.972 --> 31:27.939
When all you want to do

31:28.378 --> 31:30.525
is scream

31:30.560 --> 31:34.195
and run wild.

31:34.682 --> 31:37.146
To release the pain.

31:38.702 --> 31:41.474
The day my momma died

31:42.730 --> 31:44.882
was the best day of my life.

31:53.750 --> 31:57.585
My mind keeps wandering
back to, uh, that night.

31:57.637 --> 31:59.587
How those men got into your house.

32:00.484 --> 32:03.008
There were no signs of forced entry.

32:04.802 --> 32:07.262
As lawmen, we are trained
to consider every angle.

32:07.314 --> 32:08.930
Such as?

32:09.271 --> 32:10.923
Perhaps you invited them in.

32:12.102 --> 32:14.235
You think that I would invite
that into my home?

32:14.271 --> 32:15.904
I think you're a man of principles.

32:16.346 --> 32:18.490
I just hope you wouldn't
endanger Elizabeth for them.

32:18.525 --> 32:21.659
Your concern for my wife is noted.

32:23.274 --> 32:25.447
I'm sure in the capital
there are lofty debates

32:25.499 --> 32:28.416
on every corner about the rights
of man and the arc of justice.

32:28.452 --> 32:31.202
But down here, on the ground, it's real.

32:31.204 --> 32:32.482
It's dangerous.

32:33.040 --> 32:36.374
You now know firsthand how
desperate these runaways can be.

32:36.376 --> 32:37.926
It's us or them.

32:39.410 --> 32:40.712
Hold up.

33:15.215 --> 33:16.548
Stop!

33:17.918 --> 33:19.751
Clyde?

33:21.805 --> 33:23.671
Help me.

33:54.113 --> 33:56.081
I'm taking my letter for ma to the post.

33:57.005 --> 33:59.251
Be at the river bend after.

34:06.460 --> 34:09.127
Kyle.

34:10.092 --> 34:12.013
Kyle, can you hear me?

34:14.601 --> 34:15.743
It's okay.

34:15.795 --> 34:16.828
You're safe.

34:17.726 --> 34:18.880
You remember what happened?

34:19.751 --> 34:20.666
The runaway.

34:21.327 --> 34:22.132
He got us both.

34:22.168 --> 34:24.469
Then I'm afraid he got away.

34:25.906 --> 34:26.922
And the rest of the posse?

34:26.974 --> 34:28.172
Still on the hunt.

34:28.225 --> 34:29.725
They're headed westward.

34:30.360 --> 34:32.594
I need to get back.

34:36.904 --> 34:38.100
Thank you.

34:38.928 --> 34:40.268
For the save.

34:40.321 --> 34:42.321
I was compelled.

34:44.358 --> 34:46.108
But you were right.

34:46.469 --> 34:48.045
Down here, on the ground,

34:48.880 --> 34:50.746
it is us versus them.

35:11.936 --> 35:13.407
You saved his life.

35:14.151 --> 35:17.269
That should buy us some
respite from speculation.

35:17.687 --> 35:18.945
Hopefully.

35:36.544 --> 35:38.660
I was just heading to the post.

35:38.662 --> 35:40.129
A normal morning.

35:40.164 --> 35:43.499
I never expected to find
my old massa just staring at me.

35:44.551 --> 35:46.164
I had imagined
a thousand different things

35:46.199 --> 35:48.597
I'd do to him
if I ever saw him once more.

35:50.021 --> 35:52.195
None of them included running again.

35:52.230 --> 35:52.814
I had just

35:52.839 --> 35:54.199
assumed you were a free man.

35:55.052 --> 35:56.617
I am a free man.

35:57.539 --> 35:58.860
We should head out.

35:58.885 --> 36:01.219
We can make it up to Ripley
before nightfall.

36:07.411 --> 36:09.978
Last words of Jesus

36:10.014 --> 36:12.693
"He that believeth

36:12.728 --> 36:14.728
and is baptized shall be saved."

36:14.789 --> 36:17.756
Today will be the beginning

36:17.792 --> 36:19.842
of your new life with him.

36:19.877 --> 36:21.343
Your sins shall be washed away.

36:21.379 --> 36:23.212
You may give yourself,

36:23.214 --> 36:27.266
mind and body to the Lord.

36:29.220 --> 36:32.221
Do you accept

36:32.223 --> 36:34.056
the one true God into your heart,

36:34.108 --> 36:37.109
to honor and obey him
for the rest of your days?

36:39.864 --> 36:41.864
In the name of the Father, the Son

36:41.899 --> 36:43.115
and the Holy Ghost, I cleanse you.

37:20.036 --> 37:22.824
Do you accept the one true God
into your heart,

37:23.649 --> 37:25.926
to honor and obey him
for the rest of your days?

37:26.911 --> 37:28.160
I do.

37:29.530 --> 37:31.839
Know I have seen you, Jezebel.

37:58.392 --> 38:00.609
Amen.

38:00.644 --> 38:03.138
Always follow the hands, not the eyes.

38:03.163 --> 38:04.725
The eyes can lie.

38:12.156 --> 38:13.603
You ain't have to cut me.

38:13.655 --> 38:14.940
Oh, they gonna do that and worse,

38:14.942 --> 38:16.702
you don't do it to 'em first.

38:17.154 --> 38:19.557
Rose, the raft's finished.

38:28.005 --> 38:29.805
She gone.

38:29.840 --> 38:31.673
Looks like the house girl
finally got sick of being dirty

38:31.675 --> 38:33.592
- with the rest of us field niggers.
- What did you do?

38:33.644 --> 38:34.927
- Nothin'.
- Y'all was arguing last night.

38:34.979 --> 38:36.222
And I ain't sad to see her go,

38:36.247 --> 38:38.514
but that don't mean I had a hand in it.

38:41.152 --> 38:43.068
I ain't no fool.

38:43.104 --> 38:45.854
You did somethin', just
like you did to Zeke.

38:45.906 --> 38:49.491
I ain't believe for one second
them catchers just got him.

38:49.527 --> 38:51.910
Oh, you wish they would, huh?
That was your plan, right?

38:51.946 --> 38:54.001
To sacrifice one of us
to save the preacher man

38:54.053 --> 38:54.980
and his girl?

38:55.533 --> 38:57.249
Zeke's on you.

38:58.198 --> 39:00.419
You touch her again, you touch
her, I'll kill you, see?

39:00.454 --> 39:01.537
Noah, stop it.

39:01.589 --> 39:04.039
Come on. Come on! She gone.

39:04.091 --> 39:06.872
She gone. Ain't nothing
we can do about it.

39:07.619 --> 39:09.419
We need him.

39:10.264 --> 39:11.794
She ain't just leave.

39:11.819 --> 39:14.159
Even she knew your plan ain't shit.

39:14.581 --> 39:16.265
That girl gave up on you.

39:58.322 --> 39:59.534
Morning.

39:59.586 --> 40:00.366
What's your business here?

40:00.833 --> 40:02.383
I suspect the same as you.

40:02.418 --> 40:04.752
Waiting for a pay day to float this way.

40:04.804 --> 40:08.055
Miss Jubilee, that pretty young thing,

40:08.091 --> 40:10.662
was kind enough to share with me
the nature of your acquaintance.

40:11.594 --> 40:12.727
And seeing how the price

40:12.762 --> 40:14.428
of those Macon niggers'
heads is so high,

40:14.464 --> 40:16.397
I thought I'd come out here
and introduce myself.

40:19.852 --> 40:21.275
Name's Jeremiah Johnson.

40:22.619 --> 40:24.322
I hope you don't mind,
I brought some friends along.

40:26.326 --> 40:28.276
See, we've heard your name, Mr. Pullman,

40:28.328 --> 40:30.659
and your reputation does proceed you.

40:31.014 --> 40:33.531
Now I see this going one of two ways.

40:33.924 --> 40:37.451
One... we can shoot it out, the
outcome of which seems obvious.

40:37.503 --> 40:39.187
Seems obvious to me.

40:39.622 --> 40:42.373
Or two, we could work together,

40:42.425 --> 40:45.009
apprehend these runaways
and split the bounty.

40:45.387 --> 40:47.295
There's plenty enough to go around.

40:47.347 --> 40:50.514
And besides, Patty likes to say,

40:50.550 --> 40:53.434
"There is no greater waste of bullets

40:53.469 --> 40:55.770
than using them on white folks."

40:57.307 --> 40:59.807
BEN Pa? There's

40:59.859 --> 41:02.109
a telegram from Jay
at the post. It's Ma.

41:02.145 --> 41:05.179
She's missin' from the hospital.

41:05.214 --> 41:09.450
Looks like a third option
has presented itself.

41:12.655 --> 41:15.289
Hyah. Come on.

41:15.325 --> 41:16.595
Hyah.

41:33.843 --> 41:36.010
Gee.

42:14.851 --> 42:17.935
Hollander. Hollander, what happened?

42:17.970 --> 42:20.354
Risdin and his...

42:20.390 --> 42:22.690
...posse.

42:22.725 --> 42:24.809
They got Clyde.

42:30.233 --> 42:32.900
John, what are you doing?

42:34.570 --> 42:37.405
Whatever it takes.

42:46.215 --> 42:48.632
Noah. Noah.

43:20.283 --> 43:21.949
Hot damn, that's some luck.

43:28.925 --> 43:31.625
That ain't no luck.
