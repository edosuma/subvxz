WEBVTT

00:21.522 --> 00:23.808
Impressive.

00:23.815 --> 00:25.066
Not many recruits
could take down

00:25.067 --> 00:26.853
a guard nearly
twice their size.

00:30.405 --> 00:32.191
He had the superior training
and conditioning.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.778
All you had
were your instincts

00:34.868 --> 00:36.244
and your teeth.

00:40.165 --> 00:41.621
Normally,
such actions would be

00:41.625 --> 00:43.911
cause for immediate
cancellation.

00:46.755 --> 00:48.962
But you've only been here
a few days

00:49.007 --> 00:52.170
and Division
is all about second chances.

00:52.177 --> 00:54.008
- I want out.
- But of course.

00:55.639 --> 00:56.879
When you're ready...

00:58.183 --> 01:00.424
When you learn that
brute force will never be

01:00.435 --> 01:03.142
as effective as deception.

01:05.232 --> 01:08.144
You can either be
powerful and beautiful,

01:08.235 --> 01:10.647
or you can be a wild animal.

01:12.364 --> 01:14.696
But you have to choose.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.315
I can't decide for you.

01:16.410 --> 01:19.447
So the question is,
who will you be?

01:26.753 --> 01:28.004
Aah!

01:54.615 --> 01:56.276
(BEEP)

02:05.542 --> 02:07.407

Get down!

(SILENCED GUNSHOTS)

02:26.271 --> 02:28.011
- Hello, Phillip.
- Hey, wait, wait, wait!

02:29.941 --> 02:31.067
We can discuss this.

02:31.109 --> 02:34.146
No more deals,
no more illusions!

02:34.154 --> 02:35.769
Ryan sacrificed
himself for the truth.

02:35.864 --> 02:37.229
Now it's your turn.

02:37.324 --> 02:38.814
There were others.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.322
It wasn't just me,
there were others.

02:42.454 --> 02:44.991
I know that.
Why do you think I'm here?

02:46.083 --> 02:47.072
(BEEP)

02:47.334 --> 02:48.494
Their names.

02:52.381 --> 02:53.871
This is the contact file.

02:53.882 --> 02:56.624
It's all of them,
the entire group.

02:56.635 --> 02:59.217
You can't let it get back to me.

02:59.221 --> 03:00.836
They'll retaliate,
no matter where you hide me.

03:00.847 --> 03:03.634
Oh, trust me.
No one will ever find you.

03:07.979 --> 03:10.356
(BEEPING)

03:13.902 --> 03:15.984
- One down.
- Seven to go.

(WHIRRING)

03:21.368 --> 03:23.529
Woman: Federal authorities
have yet to comment on

03:23.537 --> 03:26.825
what caused the explosion,
but marshals have conﬁrmed

03:26.832 --> 03:29.539
that this was the convoy
transporting Phillip Jones,

03:29.543 --> 03:31.704
the former CFO of MDK.

03:31.712 --> 03:32.701
(DOOR OPENS)

03:36.383 --> 03:38.044
- What the hell is she doing?
- Don't you people knock?

03:38.051 --> 03:40.383
Exactly what she told you
needs to be done.

03:40.387 --> 03:41.547
She's taking out the group.

03:41.555 --> 03:44.012
And I told her there's
a process, investigate,

03:44.015 --> 03:46.006
collect evidence,
ferret them out.

03:46.017 --> 03:48.008
We can't just go around
killing these people,

03:48.019 --> 03:49.179
even if they're dirty.

03:49.187 --> 03:51.769
Why not?
Sounds like a plan to me.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.809
Hard to believe, but there are
ways of getting things done

03:53.817 --> 03:55.603
that don't involve
illegal activities.

03:55.610 --> 03:56.941
Yeah,
well, she tried it that way,

03:56.945 --> 03:58.810
and now Ryan's dead.

03:58.822 --> 04:00.437
You're saying you
agree with this?

04:00.449 --> 04:01.609
No.

04:03.243 --> 04:07.361
What I'm saying is,
she's just getting started.

04:22.012 --> 04:24.253
So we've given her the
Presidential Medal of Freedom.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.800
She's a national hero.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.763
Now she's out there
assassinating charter members

04:27.768 --> 04:29.053
of the Fortune 500.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.607
Be sure to get my neck,
would you?

04:37.611 --> 04:38.771
Of course.

04:44.409 --> 04:46.946
Our government forbids
the assassination--

04:46.953 --> 04:48.693
Don't make me laugh.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.696
Our government trained her
to be an assassin.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.455
And she never
misses her target.

05:05.222 --> 05:06.462
So what?

05:06.473 --> 05:09.340
Nikki's wiping out the elites
that killed Ryan

05:09.351 --> 05:11.012
and tried to start
World War III?

05:11.019 --> 05:12.304
Oh, no.
We don't want that.

05:14.064 --> 05:15.645
Let's say Ryan Fletcher's
intel is correct,

05:15.649 --> 05:18.561
and this group
has planted 54 doubles

05:18.568 --> 05:21.435
in key positions of power
around the world.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.650
What happens after,

05:24.658 --> 05:27.775
when Nikita kills
the puppet masters?

05:30.664 --> 05:33.531
There would be sleeper agents
operating off book,

05:33.583 --> 05:37.952
military officers,
executives, politicians.

05:37.963 --> 05:39.294
This is why you need
to get us off the base.

05:39.297 --> 05:40.457
We're the only ones
who can rein her in.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.501
- I don't think that's--
- You are not gonna find her.

05:42.509 --> 05:45.125
Sonya's already looking for her
through Shadownet,

05:45.136 --> 05:46.842
but there's only so much
we can do from a desk.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.054
We need to be on the ground,
that's how we'll find her.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.217
Yeah, but why should we?

05:53.228 --> 05:57.892
Look, Nikita wants to reduce
the 1% ofthe 1% to O.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.889
I say pull up a chair
and pass the popcorn.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.516
You really want
innocent people to die?

06:01.528 --> 06:03.018
Because that is
what is going to happen.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.645
Come on, Mikey,
she wouldn't let that happen.

06:05.657 --> 06:06.897
You really think
you know her that well?

06:08.618 --> 06:10.870
But you weren't there
in the very beginning.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.416
You didn't see her
when she ﬁrst came in.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.754
This is her fourth incident
in her first week,

06:26.761 --> 06:29.013
and now Damon's
missing half his ear.

06:29.014 --> 06:31.175
Everyone knows Damon likes
to knock the girls around.

06:31.182 --> 06:33.389
It was inevitable one of them
decided to knock back.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.758
Well, it's one thing
to go after a guard,

06:34.769 --> 06:36.760
it's another to attack someone
who's trying to help her.

06:36.813 --> 06:39.725
She needs training
like any recruit.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.182
No, this is different.

06:42.277 --> 06:45.360
She doesn't fight
for a purpose.

06:45.363 --> 06:46.944
She fights as if something's
trying to get out of her.

06:47.032 --> 06:48.147
She's...

06:48.158 --> 06:50.490
- Special.
- Dangerous.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.699
I'm going
to recommend to Percy

06:55.749 --> 06:57.410
that we cut our losses
and cancel her.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.792
You know, the entire time
we were talking,

07:01.796 --> 07:04.378
she was trying to figure out
a way to kill me.

07:04.382 --> 07:06.338
Her tactical sense
is intuitive.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.668
If we could just harness
that talent,

07:10.430 --> 07:12.796
she could be the greatest agent
Division's ever known.

07:12.807 --> 07:15.184
But if we can't control it,
she could be the weapon

07:15.185 --> 07:16.971
that destroys us all.

07:17.729 --> 07:19.185
What does that prove ?

07:20.440 --> 07:21.805
She did destroy Division.
What's wrong with that?

07:21.816 --> 07:24.148
It's not about Division
or training or even Amanda.

07:24.152 --> 07:28.111
It's about Nikita
and what is deep inside of her.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.194
It's...

07:29.908 --> 07:31.193
a darkness.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.775
Look, Amanda showed
her happiness,

07:34.371 --> 07:36.737
the finish line,
and she stole it all away.

07:36.748 --> 07:40.036
I mean, that's enough to turn
anybody upside down.

07:40.585 --> 07:43.076
Look, 10 years ago,
when I said she could end up

07:43.088 --> 07:45.704
destroying us all,
l was talking about Division.

07:45.924 --> 07:48.631
But now, I'm talking
about the world.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.635
As much as I love her,
I can't let that happen.

07:59.354 --> 08:00.594
Stop her.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.645
Do whatever you have to do.

08:13.159 --> 08:15.150
Yeah, but you said
she wouldn't come after us.

08:15.161 --> 08:17.243
l underestimated her
desperation.

08:17.247 --> 08:18.327
Great.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.912
Can you make sure
to let Howorth,

08:19.916 --> 08:21.497
Wells, and Kwon know that?

08:21.501 --> 08:24.664
Oh, wait, you can't.
They're dead.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.377
The priority at the moment
is to make sure

08:26.381 --> 08:28.997
you and the rest of the group
remain safe.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.670
Look, Nikita works best

08:30.677 --> 08:32.167
when she can divide
and conquer.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.964
| suggest you deny her
that approach,

08:33.972 --> 08:36.179
and fortify
to a single location.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.343
No, this place
is totally off the grid.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.592
I ran it through
a dozen shell companies,

08:40.603 --> 08:41.638
so it wouldn't show up
under my name.

08:41.646 --> 08:42.681
Perfect.

08:42.689 --> 08:44.850
I'll come prepared
with some recommendations

08:44.858 --> 08:45.847
on how to deal with Nikita.

08:45.859 --> 08:46.848
No.

08:46.860 --> 08:50.694
I'll call the others,
and we'll figure out Nikita.

08:50.697 --> 08:51.937
And then we'll discuss you.

08:53.158 --> 08:54.193
Me?

08:54.200 --> 08:56.282
Yeah, this group
has enjoyed success

08:56.286 --> 08:59.494
from a position of absolute
secrecy for generations.

08:59.497 --> 09:01.874
All that started to change
once we brought you on board.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.661
I hardly think
I can be blamed.

09:03.668 --> 09:05.044
Look, [7/ bottom-line
it for you,

09:05.045 --> 09:06.205
this meeting

09:06.421 --> 09:08.286
is for decision-makers only,
all right?

09:08.298 --> 09:10.209
Your history shows you're not
someone who can be in charge.

09:10.216 --> 09:12.798
It's just something
you're not capable of.

09:13.219 --> 09:16.211
Hey, but I'll put in
a good word for you.

09:21.519 --> 09:23.635
You have no idea
what I'm capable of.

09:27.484 --> 09:29.770
( FOOTSTEP APPROACHING )

09:29.778 --> 09:31.518

that Sam and I found

09:33.573 --> 09:34.733
from a shoperative in Zurich.

09:36.826 --> 09:37.815
Great.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.408

same friends and family plan.

09:41.664 --> 09:42.995
(COMPUTER BEEPS)

09:46.920 --> 09:48.456
I got something.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.121
A message.

09:51.382 --> 09:53.714
Looks like Trevor Adrian
called a meeting.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.550
These are GPS coordinates.

09:57.722 --> 09:59.758
Somewhere near Binghamton.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.506
It's a few hours away.
We can be there soon.

10:02.477 --> 10:04.092
Nikita, you sure about this?

10:04.104 --> 10:05.264
It's perfect.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.227
They'll all be
in the same place.

10:07.232 --> 10:09.268
Right, which means
a frontal assault.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.651
Not picking them off
one by one

10:10.652 --> 10:11.687
from the shadows anymore.

10:13.488 --> 10:15.570
So far we've managed to keep
your name out of the news.

10:15.573 --> 10:16.824
But this?

10:16.825 --> 10:18.656
This will get loud.

10:18.660 --> 10:19.991
Let it get loud.

10:23.331 --> 10:25.572
You know that I'm with you
no matter what.

10:25.583 --> 10:26.618
You want
to invade the moon,

10:26.626 --> 10:27.957
and I will find
the next rocket ship.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.703
But please,

10:30.713 --> 10:32.453
think about the line
that you're about to cross.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.003
You fought so hard
to clear your name,

10:36.010 --> 10:37.921
and you're finally
being recognized

10:37.929 --> 10:40.796
for who you really are,
a hero.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.798
Alex,

10:42.809 --> 10:45.972
you've always said that you've
learned so much from me.

10:45.979 --> 10:46.968
And you know what?

10:46.980 --> 10:49.221
I've learned
a lot from you too.

10:49.232 --> 10:53.316
I've learned to stop
running from who I am,

10:53.319 --> 10:56.231
embrace my identity
the way you have.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.404
That is how I know
I'm not a hero.

11:00.451 --> 11:01.736
(THUD)

11:03.580 --> 11:05.662
Birkhoff, get Shadownet up
and running.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.166
All right, might take a minute.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.909
Sonya's getting us an uplink
to the NSA's sat servers,

11:09.919 --> 11:11.625
give us an eye in the sky.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.083
Yeah.

11:14.799 --> 11:15.834
Dad gave me access.

11:15.842 --> 11:17.048
We're official now, remember?

11:17.051 --> 11:18.211
- Give me a gun.
- What?

11:18.219 --> 11:19.334
Give me a gun.
We've got company.

11:19.345 --> 11:20.551
Give me a gun.

11:20.555 --> 11:21.886
Whoa.

11:21.890 --> 11:23.630
Easy.

11:23.641 --> 11:24.676
Stand down.

11:26.144 --> 11:27.429
Colonel Slocum?

11:27.854 --> 11:29.936
- Who?
- From the JAG office.

11:29.939 --> 11:31.190
He interrogated us
back at the base.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.180
That was a debrief.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.433
An interrogation
would feel a bit different.

11:35.528 --> 11:36.517
You're here to interrogate?

11:36.529 --> 11:37.518
Supervise.

11:37.530 --> 11:38.861
Per Senator Chappell's request.

11:38.865 --> 11:39.854
We're fine on our own.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.481
It's not an option.

11:41.492 --> 11:43.949
This isn't a field trip
to find a lost camper.

11:43.953 --> 11:45.409
It's a matter of
national security.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.529
You know what, JAG officer,

11:47.540 --> 11:49.405
we've had enough
of you soldier types.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.157
Why don't you take
your army of two

11:51.169 --> 11:52.705
and go clean each other's
gun somewhere?

11:52.712 --> 11:53.872
You don't get it.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.541
You haven't been released.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.049
You're out on a temporary pass,

11:57.050 --> 11:59.291
which means you are
still our responsibility.

11:59.844 --> 12:01.300
You may be
used to breaking laws

12:01.304 --> 12:03.716
all over the planet,
but not anymore.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.384
This is a military
operation now.

12:19.197 --> 12:20.562
That's the last of them.

12:21.032 --> 12:22.067
They're all here.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.828
What the hell is that?
Come on.

12:30.875 --> 12:31.864
You two stay here.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.769
(FIGHTING OUTSIDE)

13:05.034 --> 13:06.114
Away from the windows now!

13:08.830 --> 13:09.569
Hi.

13:10.623 --> 13:11.738
We haven't officially met.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.745
(BEEP)

13:14.752 --> 13:16.413
I need access
to the security cameras

13:16.421 --> 13:18.252
at Mr. Adrian's house.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.205
Yes, the one upstate.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.253
Of course he knows
I'm doing this.

13:33.604 --> 13:35.310
(RINGING)

13:40.820 --> 13:42.981
(BEEPING)

13:42.989 --> 13:44.195
Hello?

13:46.993 --> 13:48.278
Lionel.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.410
Amanda.

13:50.413 --> 13:51.823
Why can't you stay dead?

13:51.831 --> 13:53.787
It wasn't a good color on me.

13:53.791 --> 13:54.951
What do you want?

13:54.959 --> 13:56.460
To pass along a tip.

13:56.461 --> 14:00.170
Nikita and Alex have just
infiltrated Trevor Adrian's

14:00.173 --> 14:02.164
compound in upstate New York.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.757
Gathered there with him
are the three remaining members

14:04.761 --> 14:06.342
of their group.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.711
And you're telling us
this because?

14:07.722 --> 14:09.212
Well, we both have
a common goal.

14:09.223 --> 14:11.134
We both want them out
of commission.

14:11.809 --> 14:13.345
You mean your bosses.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.809
Not anymore.

14:14.812 --> 14:17.019
For a while, I thought
they could be useful partners.

14:17.023 --> 14:19.389
But it turns out they're just
another group of self-involved,

14:19.400 --> 14:20.936
over-privileged men
who think they know

14:20.943 --> 14:24.276
how best to control
other people's destinies.

14:24.739 --> 14:26.195
Well, if that's
the way you feel,

14:26.199 --> 14:27.735
why don't you let Nikita
finish the job?

14:27.742 --> 14:29.778
Because she won't stop
with them.

14:29.786 --> 14:32.027
Once she's through,
I'll be her next target.

14:32.038 --> 14:34.029
Obviously, I don't want that.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.998
I don't think you want her
going down that path either.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.711
She's murdered three people
in cold blood.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.705
What happens if she turns
Adrian '8 place

14:43.716 --> 14:44.796
into a slaughterhouse?

14:44.801 --> 14:47.793
Do you really think there'll be
anything left of her soul then?

14:51.349 --> 14:53.055
(BEEP)

14:56.396 --> 14:58.478
(BEEPING)

14:58.481 --> 14:59.766
Got him.

14:59.774 --> 15:04.814
Trevor Adrian, heir to the
Adrian industrial fortune.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.690
Six residences listed,

15:06.697 --> 15:07.903
none of them
in upstate New York.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.073
Hang on, maybe there's
something off the books.

15:13.329 --> 15:14.660
All right,
there '8 a few properties

15:14.789 --> 15:16.654
that fit the bill.

15:16.666 --> 15:17.906
Yeah, I think I got it.

15:17.917 --> 15:18.906
You got thermal?

15:18.918 --> 15:20.283
Thanks to Sonya, I do.

15:22.964 --> 15:24.579
Six heat signatures inside.

15:24.590 --> 15:27.127
Cluster pattern suggests
four are hostages.

15:27.135 --> 15:28.420
Get us there, now.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.631
You have to understand,
alright?

15:35.643 --> 15:37.474
We--we don't know what goes on

15:37.478 --> 15:39.514
in our operations
at a day-to-day level.

15:39.522 --> 15:42.639
Alright? It's really Amanda
that you're after.

15:43.025 --> 15:44.481
I'll get to her soon enough.

15:44.485 --> 15:46.476
Yeah, but she won't
be easy to find.

15:47.113 --> 15:48.899
What if we give her to you?

15:48.906 --> 15:51.613
You know, maybe
we could work out a deal.

15:51.617 --> 15:54.279
Yeah?
You want to make me an offer?

15:54.287 --> 15:56.118
Give me Ryan Fletcher back.

15:56.122 --> 15:57.111
Can you do that?

16:00.126 --> 16:02.583
(RINGING)

16:09.886 --> 16:11.046
Hello?

16:11.512 --> 16:12.672
Nikita, you don't
have to do this.

16:12.680 --> 16:15.046
There is another way.

16:15.266 --> 16:16.927
We tried the other way,
and now Ryan's dead.

16:16.934 --> 16:17.923
Ryan wouldn't have wanted--

16:17.935 --> 16:19.800
Ryan wanted to get the group.

16:22.398 --> 16:24.013
He's why I'm doing this.

16:24.025 --> 16:25.936
Amanda wants you to do it, too.

16:25.943 --> 16:28.025
How do you think we found you?

16:28.029 --> 16:30.111
She wants you to do
her dirty work for her.

16:30.114 --> 16:31.524
You do this, and she wins.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.653
Nikita, we've got company.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.495
You sent troops?

16:43.503 --> 16:45.539
What?
No, we didn't send anyone.

16:45.546 --> 16:46.581
I did.

16:47.173 --> 16:48.162
I made it very clear.

16:48.174 --> 16:49.960
This is a military operation.

17:17.537 --> 17:20.153
(PHONE RINGING)

17:26.754 --> 17:28.710
You need to come out
before anyone gets hurt.

17:29.090 --> 17:30.876
Who else is still out there?

17:30.967 --> 17:31.956
Force Recon.

17:31.968 --> 17:33.174
And they're on a hair trigger.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.634
Okay, just hold them off for me
for a little bit longer.

17:35.638 --> 17:37.754
Nikita, I am not here to run
interference for you.

17:37.765 --> 17:38.845
I know.

17:38.849 --> 17:41.010
And I know that
they asked you to do this.

17:41.018 --> 17:42.724
They put you up to being
my personal connection, and--

17:42.812 --> 17:44.393
No one asked me to do anything.
I'm here on my own,

17:44.605 --> 17:47.062
and I am telling you--Stop this
before it goes too far.

17:50.695 --> 17:52.902
Michael,
you don't understand.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.816
I'm about to get
the list of doubles.

17:54.824 --> 17:56.689
And then what?
What are you gonna do with it?

17:56.701 --> 17:58.066
I don't really have many
opﬂons,

17:58.077 --> 18:00.910
but I'm gonna get this out
to the world today.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.369
Then it won't matter
what they do to me,

18:02.373 --> 18:03.909
because the whole world
will know the truth.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.326
Nikita, more than anyone,

18:05.334 --> 18:06.744
you know how dangerous
the truth can be.

18:06.752 --> 18:07.912
This is how we destroy them.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.251
But what about
the collateral damage?

18:09.255 --> 18:10.995
- I don't care!
- Yes, you do.

18:11.007 --> 18:12.417
Remember that you do--

18:12.425 --> 18:13.414
(CLICK)

18:17.013 --> 18:18.344
I need you to do something.

18:29.442 --> 18:32.104
This is an experimental
neurotoxin.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.272
Odorless, tasteless.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.441
It's designed to be
in a person's system

18:36.449 --> 18:38.314
and be undetectable,
until it turns their organs

18:38.326 --> 18:39.691
into blood pudding.

18:41.245 --> 18:45.659
Probably recognize it,
since MDK designed it.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.122
Give me the list of doubles,

18:47.126 --> 18:49.333
or you'll get to see how good
your scientists really are.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.082
Who wants a shot?

18:56.093 --> 18:57.708
If you're gonna kill us,
get on with it.

18:57.720 --> 18:58.800
For God's sake, Carl.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.795
Carl: Don't you see
she's playing with us?

19:00.806 --> 19:02.637
This is just cheap theatrics.

19:14.028 --> 19:15.108
No,no,no.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.495
Ugh.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.035
(GAGGING)

20:00.533 --> 20:03.821
The bar, uh, top drawer.
There's a false bottom.

20:11.127 --> 20:12.367
Call it up.

20:29.645 --> 20:30.725
That's it.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.186
Every political official,
diplomat,

20:32.189 --> 20:35.022
and military officer
in the world we've replaced.

20:35.192 --> 20:37.057
Under no circumstances
can she be allowed

20:37.069 --> 20:38.104
to get that list
out of the house.

20:38.112 --> 20:39.227
I don't care
what you have to do.

20:39.405 --> 20:41.236
Break cover if you must.
Are we clear?

20:42.908 --> 20:43.818
What are you doing?

20:43.951 --> 20:45.157
Sending it
to the news outlets.

20:45.161 --> 20:47.322
- Which ones?
- All of them.

20:47.329 --> 20:48.409
It's gonna go so far and wide,

20:48.414 --> 20:50.075
no one's gonna be
able to cover it up.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.869
She's searching
for a wireless signal.

20:52.877 --> 20:55.038
She's getting ready to transmit.

20:55.045 --> 20:56.296
Major, do your snipers
have a shot?

20:56.297 --> 20:57.457
No, no, no, not yet.

20:57.465 --> 20:58.671
Birkhoff, are you ready?

20:58.674 --> 21:00.665
Almost there.

21:02.303 --> 21:03.292
Jamming field active.

21:06.515 --> 21:08.847
(BEEPING)

21:08.851 --> 21:10.842
(TYPING)

21:11.228 --> 21:12.434
Birkhoff.

21:14.190 --> 21:16.101
(PHONE RINGING)

21:17.151 --> 21:18.106
Keep her on that line.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.896
Why, what are you gonna do?

21:21.781 --> 21:23.112
Plan B.

21:23.991 --> 21:25.356
Michael,
stop the jamming shield.

21:25.367 --> 21:26.402
This isn't Michael.

21:27.620 --> 21:28.735
Sam.

21:28.746 --> 21:31.283
Look, I get it, okay?

21:31.290 --> 21:33.576
I know these bastards
deserve to pay.

21:33.584 --> 21:35.245
But as much as I hate
to admit it, Michael's right.

21:35.252 --> 21:36.241
This ain't the way.

21:38.464 --> 21:39.670
What do you care?

21:39.673 --> 21:41.049
There's no profit in it for you.

21:41.050 --> 21:42.085
Okay.

21:42.092 --> 21:44.504
All right.
I deserve that.

21:44.512 --> 21:45.627
But now you got
to listen to me.

21:45.638 --> 21:46.878
You remember London?

21:49.391 --> 21:50.722
I had a black box
in my hand,

21:50.726 --> 21:53.308
and I was gonna release
the secrets to the world.

21:53.312 --> 21:55.223
You stopped me before
I made the same mistake

21:55.231 --> 21:56.266
you're about to make right now.

21:56.273 --> 21:59.060
You were suffering
from regimen psychosis, I'm not.

21:59.068 --> 22:00.649
My head is clearer
than it's ever been.

22:00.820 --> 22:01.809
It's not about
where your head's at.

22:05.324 --> 22:07.531
If Owen was here,
he'd say you're hurting

22:08.702 --> 22:09.953
and that now's the time
to trust the people

22:09.954 --> 22:10.989
that care about you.

22:10.996 --> 22:12.111
He 'd tell you it's not
about your head,

22:12.122 --> 22:14.738
it's about your heart
and your soul.

22:18.754 --> 22:19.834
That's what Owen would say.

22:22.758 --> 22:25.295
Patch me in to Alex's comm,
and only Alex's comm.

22:28.639 --> 22:31.130
Alex, it's Michael.

22:31.141 --> 22:32.642
Don 't let Nikita know
you can hear me.

22:32.643 --> 22:33.632
What are you doing?

22:33.644 --> 22:35.760
You need to stop her
from making this mistake.

22:36.647 --> 22:38.057
These are the people
that killed Ryan.

22:38.065 --> 22:39.145
Why are you protecting them?

22:39.149 --> 22:40.184
It's not about them.

22:40.192 --> 22:41.227
It's about that list
she's trying

22:41.235 --> 22:42.224
to send out to the world.

22:42.236 --> 22:44.192
Do you know what'll happen
if she succeeds?

22:44.196 --> 22:46.403
No, Sam.
I know what I'm doing.

22:46.407 --> 22:48.022
Tell Michael
to stop the jamming field,

22:48.033 --> 22:49.318
or I kill them.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.241
All!

22:51.245 --> 22:53.201
Hey, she's gonna shoot 'em.

22:55.583 --> 22:56.948
(BEEP)

22:56.959 --> 22:59.792
Nikita, if you start shooting,
the Marines will attack.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.704
Then it's yourjob to make sure
I don't die in vain, isn't it?

23:04.466 --> 23:05.455
Man: Snipers have a shot.

23:05.467 --> 23:06.456
Do we have a green light?

23:08.429 --> 23:10.044
Nikita, please.

23:17.813 --> 23:21.772
I have nothing left.
If you die, I die.

23:35.414 --> 23:36.950
All right.

23:39.585 --> 23:40.791
You're right.
We'll do it your way.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.410
Thank you.

23:45.925 --> 23:48.632
Stand the snipers down.
Repeat, stand down.

23:48.636 --> 23:50.092
Need to access
a secure server.

23:50.095 --> 23:51.255
Okay.

23:51.263 --> 23:53.128
Birkhoff will open
a data channel,

23:53.140 --> 23:54.380
transfer the file through it.

23:54.391 --> 23:58.100
Once we receive the file,
the Marines will back off,

23:58.103 --> 23:59.138
and then you can
come out peacefully.

24:12.743 --> 24:14.449
(BEEP)

24:19.124 --> 24:20.159
Michael:
Birkhoff, did you get it?

24:21.794 --> 24:22.783
Did you get the file?

24:24.630 --> 24:27.963
I did, and I sent it
someplace safe.

24:27.967 --> 24:30.128
What are you talking about,
someplace safe?

24:30.135 --> 24:32.046
Nikki, remember
operation Red Harvest?

24:32.054 --> 24:33.885
If you do, then you'll know
where I sent the ﬁle.

24:33.889 --> 24:35.174
Same server, same pass code.

24:35.182 --> 24:37.093
What the hell are you doing?

24:37.101 --> 24:38.386
Nikki's right.

24:38.394 --> 24:40.555
Too many secrets, too many lies.

24:40.562 --> 24:42.177
- Turn that file over now!
- Whoa.

24:42.189 --> 24:43.349
- Relax.
- Put it down!

24:43.357 --> 24:44.893
Not until
he turns over that file.

24:44.900 --> 24:46.982
I will put all of you down!

24:47.653 --> 24:48.813
Easy.

24:53.534 --> 24:55.274
Nikita, what are you doing?

24:55.285 --> 24:56.491
Birkhoff's giving me
a second chance.

24:56.495 --> 24:57.826
I'm not gonna waste it.

25:01.166 --> 25:02.576
Don't do this.

25:03.085 --> 25:04.165
Alex!

25:05.337 --> 25:06.372
Get out of my way.

25:08.132 --> 25:10.088
The person who trained me
would want me to stop you.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.905
You saved me once.
Now I'm trying to save you.

25:38.912 --> 25:40.493
We can't release that file.

25:56.013 --> 25:58.345
This is Slocum.
Raid! Raid! Raid!

26:15.616 --> 26:16.822
Get down, get down,
get down!

26:16.825 --> 26:17.905
She's down!

26:17.910 --> 26:19.400
- I surrender!
- Down on the floor!

26:24.500 --> 26:26.240
(INDISTINCT VOICES ECHOING)

26:44.103 --> 26:45.513
She's being
processed right now.

26:51.360 --> 26:53.191
And we brought in the
Udinov woman as well.

26:53.195 --> 26:54.651
She's in D-block.

26:55.364 --> 26:56.979
I also arrested
and booked that hacker.

27:01.203 --> 27:03.034
That list is still out there.

27:03.038 --> 27:04.574
If we're to have
any hope of recovering it--

27:04.581 --> 27:05.991
What about Amanda?

27:05.999 --> 27:07.284
No sign of her at the house.

27:07.292 --> 27:09.123
Senator,
I requested your approval

27:09.128 --> 27:10.493
to isolate F-block.

27:10.504 --> 27:12.165
Relax. It's done.

27:12.172 --> 27:13.912
Doesn't mean I like it.

27:13.924 --> 27:17.382
Sir, I need the entire wing
to be isolated.

27:17.386 --> 27:18.967
We all know
how dangerous she is.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.131
Cut the crap.
I know why you want it.

27:20.139 --> 27:22.505
And it's not supposed
to happen on American soil.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.843
I didn't see the need
to bring them into custody.

27:28.564 --> 27:29.644
Rest assured,

27:29.648 --> 27:31.809
they are no longer
part of the process.

27:42.870 --> 27:44.610
Think there's gonna be
a lot of security?

27:44.621 --> 27:46.031
Take a wild guess.

27:46.832 --> 27:48.197
Got enough firepower?

27:48.208 --> 27:49.197
I just hope it's all worth it.

27:49.209 --> 27:51.074
Nikita's in a real bad spot
right now,

27:51.086 --> 27:52.451
and we kind of put her there.

27:52.754 --> 27:53.914
She knew what she was
getting into.

28:09.980 --> 28:11.470
I'm not giving you that list.

28:11.481 --> 28:12.812
This is the most secure wing

28:12.816 --> 28:15.478
in one of the most secure
prisons on the planet.

28:15.485 --> 28:18.067
Solitary cells
with steel-reinforced doors,

28:18.071 --> 28:20.198
and of course,
constant surveillance.

28:21.116 --> 28:23.858
Although that's been shut off.

28:23.869 --> 28:25.530
And the entire wing's
been emptied.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.573
For what? Torture?

28:27.581 --> 28:28.661
Good luck.

28:28.665 --> 28:31.532
No, not torture.

28:31.919 --> 28:35.161
I just needed to make sure
no one would ever hear or see

28:35.172 --> 28:36.503
what's gonna happen here.

28:38.550 --> 28:39.585
All clear!

29:03.283 --> 29:06.320
You just had to twist
the knife, didn't you?

29:06.328 --> 29:10.116
No, Nikita,
I'm here to thank you.

29:10.123 --> 29:12.250
I control
this wing of the prison,

29:12.251 --> 29:14.082
and thanks to you,

29:14.086 --> 29:16.543
I control 54 agents
all over the world.

29:16.546 --> 29:18.958
Highly placed, powerful,
and completely loyal to me.

29:18.966 --> 29:21.207
(SPEAKING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

29:26.515 --> 29:28.972
lfl use the Sarin gas,
the casualties will be greater.

29:29.434 --> 29:31.299
Woman: Impressive work.

29:31.311 --> 29:32.767
And they all seem
to respond well.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.181
Well, they all went through
the same adjustment

29:34.189 --> 29:36.271
you went through.

29:36.275 --> 29:37.765
And now they all know
who's in charge.

29:41.697 --> 29:44.985
I still have that master list
on an encrypted cloud server.

29:45.701 --> 29:47.532
No, you don't.

29:47.995 --> 29:50.327
Birkhoff isn't the only one
who remembers

29:50.497 --> 29:52.362
operation Red Harvest.

29:52.457 --> 29:54.709
The list wasn't
that hard to find.

29:55.335 --> 29:56.324
You erased it?

29:56.336 --> 29:57.837
I bought the company
that owns the server,

29:57.838 --> 29:59.624
and then I shut down
the entire server farm.

30:01.174 --> 30:03.586
This is it, Nikita.
This is the end.

30:10.183 --> 30:12.890
I'm a new woman
because of you.

30:13.854 --> 30:15.014
I'm transformed.

30:15.022 --> 30:18.890
Your face is transformed.
Is that a gift from Ryan?

30:18.900 --> 30:21.687
Oh, no,
this is nothing compared

30:21.695 --> 30:22.901
to what you've endured.

30:22.904 --> 30:25.065
All that killing.

30:25.866 --> 30:27.731
I know how it must
have torn you apart,

30:27.743 --> 30:29.904
resurrecting
the monster inside.

30:30.287 --> 30:34.155
I know because I understand

30:34.166 --> 30:35.406
where that darkness was formed.

30:38.587 --> 30:40.703
The abuse you endured
growing up.

30:43.884 --> 30:47.001
I know because I was formed
in the same place.

30:47.012 --> 30:50.425
But today, I rose above it all.

30:50.432 --> 30:51.888
It wasn't easy.

30:52.934 --> 30:56.677
You were always
a natural leader.

30:57.731 --> 31:00.268
I didn't encourage it,
of course, not inside Division.

31:00.275 --> 31:03.938
But after you left me,
this team you put together,

31:03.945 --> 31:05.776
they followed you....

31:06.281 --> 31:07.487
They looked to you.

31:07.491 --> 31:09.607
Ryan gave his life for you.

31:12.954 --> 31:16.446
I had to claw my way
to the top, past Percy,

31:16.458 --> 31:17.948
past Oversight, the Group.

31:19.961 --> 31:22.623
A long time ago,
I gave you a choice,

31:22.631 --> 31:24.087
brutality or deception.

31:24.091 --> 31:28.084
You should have listened to me.
And to Michael--to Alex.

31:41.316 --> 31:42.977
I'm going to leave you here...

31:46.488 --> 31:50.072
where no one will ever see
or hear from you again.

31:51.701 --> 31:53.657
But you can take comfort
in knowing

31:53.662 --> 31:55.823
that you will never
be forgotten.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.457
I have doctors who can
take this scar away.

32:04.256 --> 32:06.668
But I'm going to leave it
as a reminder.

32:06.842 --> 32:08.753
Not only
for what you did today,

32:09.803 --> 32:12.670
but for every wound
you ever inflicted on me.

32:13.348 --> 32:14.679
But, Amanda...

32:20.397 --> 32:21.682
I'm not done.

32:26.361 --> 32:27.817
Slocum!

32:32.534 --> 32:34.115
I'm not a monster.

32:34.870 --> 32:36.406
I just wanted you
to think I was.

32:38.498 --> 32:39.704
Show her, Nerd.

32:49.551 --> 32:50.882
I didn't kill anyone.

32:56.892 --> 32:58.883
And I did listen
to Michael and Alex and,

32:58.894 --> 33:00.054
yes, even you.

33:03.398 --> 33:05.138
Didn't |, Alex?

33:05.150 --> 33:08.062
Brute force will never be
as powerful as deception.

33:11.740 --> 33:14.607
We had to scare the crap
out of some top-shelf dirtbags.

33:17.078 --> 33:18.614
They actually thought
they were going to die.

33:24.377 --> 33:27.460
From the last victim,
the plan was to work our way

33:27.464 --> 33:28.920
through the group,
all the way to you.

33:36.264 --> 33:39.222
But you called a meeting,
which made it that much easier.

33:39.226 --> 33:41.091
Adrian's house
was the big show,

33:41.102 --> 33:43.184
and we made him the star.

33:43.188 --> 33:45.930
It was all about
getting that list.

33:45.941 --> 33:49.604
The neurotoxin was a modiﬁed
form of tetrodotoxin.

33:49.611 --> 33:50.646
Death-like symptoms,

33:50.654 --> 33:52.565
but without
the lasting side effects.

33:54.783 --> 33:58.651
But that gun.
Well, that was Nikita's idea.

33:59.120 --> 34:00.906
Non-lethal tranq rounds.

34:00.914 --> 34:03.121
Look and sound like
the real thing,

34:03.124 --> 34:04.660
but all they do
is put you to bed.

34:07.629 --> 34:10.120
After we got the list,
Nerd went to work.

34:10.131 --> 34:12.793
Nikki gave me full access
to Adrian '8 laptop.

34:14.803 --> 34:15.963
l tracked down
all the Shop facilities

34:15.971 --> 34:17.381
he'd been talking to.

34:21.142 --> 34:22.131
Turns out, it was just one.

34:24.104 --> 34:25.969
Western Pennsylvania, right?

34:25.981 --> 34:27.471
Converted coal mine?

34:27.983 --> 34:31.191
Your roster listed it
as Replication Center.

34:31.653 --> 34:33.143
Fancy name for toy factory,

34:33.154 --> 34:35.281
where you make
your little wind-up dolls.

34:35.782 --> 34:37.397
But you like to keep
the originals, don 't you?

34:37.409 --> 34:39.070
Nobody knows that
better than me.

34:40.996 --> 34:42.952
But none of this could have
happened without Slocum.

34:42.956 --> 34:44.992
He was our audience,
and through him, you.

34:53.341 --> 34:55.002
How did you know
he was a double?

34:55.010 --> 34:56.716
Ryan told me
on his deathbed.

34:58.138 --> 34:59.799
Slocum is a double.

35:01.433 --> 35:03.469
And trust me,
I wanted to kill Slocum

35:03.476 --> 35:04.682
and every single member
of the group

35:04.686 --> 35:05.675
just to get to you.

35:08.023 --> 35:12.266
I was gonna rip your guts out
and wipe the walls with them.

35:13.028 --> 35:16.316
But my friends, my family,
they reminded me

35:16.323 --> 35:19.986
that I'm better than that
and that the right thing to do

35:19.993 --> 35:21.858
would be to lure you in,
not kill you.

35:21.870 --> 35:23.735
Under no circumstances
can she be allowed

35:23.747 --> 35:24.862
to get that list
out of the house.

35:24.873 --> 35:26.829
I don 't care
what you have to do.

35:26.833 --> 35:29.700
And in order to do that,
I needed you to feel

35:29.711 --> 35:30.871
that I'd lost my way.

35:34.049 --> 35:36.335
I needed to become
the destroyer that you met

35:36.468 --> 35:37.833
all those years ago.

35:38.762 --> 35:40.298
Remember her?

35:41.556 --> 35:43.057
I do.

35:46.227 --> 35:48.559
She is a part of me.

35:48.563 --> 35:51.555
And she always will be,
but she's not everything.

35:54.069 --> 35:58.153
You asked me to choose,
who will I be?

35:59.741 --> 36:02.027
This is my choice.

36:05.038 --> 36:07.700
There are people out there
loyal to me.

36:07.707 --> 36:09.243
They will find me.

36:09.250 --> 36:11.741
No one will ever find you.

36:14.339 --> 36:16.204
Welcome back
to the basement...

36:17.092 --> 36:18.207
Helen.

36:27.519 --> 36:30.181
Nikita!

36:34.776 --> 36:39.236
That was a risky move, letting
the Marines take you down.

36:39.239 --> 36:40.900
Right up till then,
I thought you had really

36:40.907 --> 36:42.272
gone off the rails.

36:42.283 --> 36:44.899
I'm sorry we couldn't bring you
into the loop sooner.

36:44.911 --> 36:46.776
The only way
this was going to work was

36:46.788 --> 36:48.369
if everyone bought into it.

36:48.748 --> 36:50.363
Don't apologize.

36:50.375 --> 36:51.785
Unlike the people
I usually work with,

36:51.793 --> 36:54.079
you guys actually
get things done.

36:56.715 --> 37:00.128
The coordinated sting
started 38 minutes ago.

37:00.135 --> 37:03.468
CIA, FBI, Interpol all working
in concert to bring in

37:03.471 --> 37:05.962
the doubles around
the world, quietly.

37:07.934 --> 37:08.969
Thank you, Senator.

37:08.977 --> 37:09.966
No.

37:11.604 --> 37:12.810
Thank you.

37:13.356 --> 37:14.766
Your pardons have
all been signed.

37:14.774 --> 37:16.355
This chapter of history is over,

37:16.359 --> 37:18.350
and a new one's begun,
for all of you.

37:22.031 --> 37:23.771
All but one of us.

37:24.451 --> 37:26.567
Ryan Fletcher's service
has been recognized.

37:28.329 --> 37:30.069
He'll be remembered.

37:38.798 --> 37:40.459
You saw the lies.

37:40.467 --> 37:42.833
You knew there'd always be

37:42.844 --> 37:44.425
someone who would
abuse their power.

37:48.391 --> 37:49.801
That's why you
looked to us.

37:54.647 --> 37:56.683
You made us better heroes.

38:09.788 --> 38:13.406
Now Ryan has given us
a gift, freedom.

38:13.541 --> 38:16.624
We 're here tonight
to honor an extraordinary--

38:16.628 --> 38:18.209
There will be a car outside
the west entrance

38:18.213 --> 38:19.544
after the speech.

38:20.548 --> 38:22.049
Stationed two men there.

38:23.176 --> 38:24.291
Is that really necessary?

38:24.302 --> 38:25.542
It's a human rights conference.

38:25.553 --> 38:27.168
They don't get that rowdy.

38:27.180 --> 38:29.546
Hey, I'm trying
to be responsible.

38:29.849 --> 38:31.350
Isn't that what people
with jobs do?

38:31.351 --> 38:33.012
Hey, you need the money.

38:35.438 --> 38:36.894
The company's
not so bad either.

38:39.651 --> 38:40.811
Dinner later?

38:42.278 --> 38:43.893
Why, you need someone
to open the wine?

38:43.905 --> 38:46.021
No, I don't drink,
which you should know about me.

38:47.742 --> 38:48.982
Any other surprises?

38:50.578 --> 38:52.443
Man: Alexandra Udinov.

38:57.877 --> 38:59.993
Nikita: Now we can ﬁnd
our place in the world,

39:00.004 --> 39:01.744
wherever that might be.

39:01.756 --> 39:05.795
So, Shadowwalker is coming out
of the shadows.

39:06.386 --> 39:08.001
That's one way
of putting it, yeah.

39:08.930 --> 39:10.886
Does this mean
you're going legit?

39:10.890 --> 39:12.050
Legﬂ?

39:14.060 --> 39:15.095
Yeah, I don't know.

39:15.103 --> 39:16.559
I've never really
done Iockstep.

39:18.273 --> 39:20.935
I've got a girl waiting
for me in London.

39:20.942 --> 39:22.478
She convinced me
sharing the code

39:22.485 --> 39:24.066
was the right thing to do.

39:24.070 --> 39:25.935
Yes. Shadownet.

39:25.947 --> 39:28.780
You claim this will protect
regular folks against

39:28.783 --> 39:30.739
government agencies
that spy on them?

39:30.743 --> 39:32.870
So this is what?

39:33.371 --> 39:35.407
Digital freedom
for the masses?

39:35.874 --> 39:40.243
I'd say more like
open-source anarchy.

39:40.962 --> 39:43.169
Yeah, I like that.
Write that down.

39:43.172 --> 39:45.254
- Open-source anarchy.
- Okay.

39:45.258 --> 39:46.794
Hyphen in between
open and source.

39:49.262 --> 39:50.968
You know, this is gonna
freak some people out.

39:51.097 --> 39:52.086
Good.

39:53.641 --> 39:55.506
That's good.

39:55.518 --> 39:57.679
Nikita: Freedom '8 a scary thing,
though.

39:57.896 --> 39:59.602
We 've got no one to answer to
but ourselves.

40:02.525 --> 40:04.641
We used to answer to them.

40:04.652 --> 40:07.314
The stepchild nobody wanted
but the world needed.

40:49.447 --> 40:53.110
(SPEAKING SPANISH )

41:13.346 --> 41:15.803
You think they'll be mad
we eloped?

41:16.432 --> 41:17.808
Well, it's not like
we planned it.

41:19.185 --> 41:20.800
I have an idea
for the honeymoon.

41:23.272 --> 41:25.058
Nikita:
Now that we 're ﬁnally free,

41:25.191 --> 41:27.352
I get why we fought so hard.

41:27.360 --> 41:28.691
The real gift isn't freedom.

41:28.695 --> 41:30.060
It's what we get to do with it.

41:41.374 --> 41:44.207
I don 't know about you,
but I could never just sit

41:44.335 --> 41:45.541
on a beach anyway.

42:12.155 --> 42:14.146
