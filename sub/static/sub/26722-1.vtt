04:55.315 --> 04:56.115
Hello.

04:58.259 --> 04:59.189
Hello.

05:02.163 --> 05:03.059
Mom.

05:04.530 --> 05:05.331
Dad.

05:06.738 --> 05:07.539
Hello.

09:08.531 --> 09:09.489
Please, what are you doing?

09:09.491 --> 09:11.027
That's for the cat.

09:23.122 --> 09:24.563
That's all I have.

10:03.123 --> 10:04.786
That's wonderful bye, bye.

10:04.788 --> 10:06.064
Au revior.

12:06.931 --> 12:08.688
I haven't got any.

12:08.690 --> 12:10.225
There's no car.

12:10.227 --> 12:11.123
My father took it.

12:12.146 --> 12:14.099
Please, I can assure you.

12:16.818 --> 12:17.649
Go and check.

12:17.651 --> 12:18.708
Go and check.

12:19.506 --> 12:20.147
S'il vous plait.

16:44.657 --> 16:45.491
Who?

16:52.498 --> 16:54.258
What about Lyon, huh?

16:55.346 --> 16:56.883
That's where they
were told to go.

16:57.971 --> 16:59.603
They probably have
vaccines by now.

17:54.578 --> 17:56.399
Please.

17:56.401 --> 17:57.585
Listen.

17:57.587 --> 17:58.515
My name is Jacques.

17:59.634 --> 18:01.552
I think, we should
just all calm down.

18:01.554 --> 18:03.536
The power will be back on soon.

18:03.538 --> 18:05.810
The government said it'll
just be a couple of days.

18:07.090 --> 18:09.008
Look, people always panic
in these situations.

18:09.010 --> 18:11.504
The mention of a flu, the
outbreak people go nuts.

18:11.506 --> 18:12.466
Have you seen it?

18:15.027 --> 18:17.840
Look, if you're scared,

18:17.842 --> 18:19.505
if you need somewhere to
stay, you can stay here.

18:19.507 --> 18:21.076
But please just
put the gun away.

20:44.817 --> 20:46.195
I thought you said no fire.

20:49.009 --> 20:49.618
Last night.

20:58.674 --> 20:59.987
How long have you been here?

21:10.737 --> 21:11.986
I flew in last a month

21:13.330 --> 21:14.996
before they shut
the airports down.

21:16.498 --> 21:18.099
It's my parent's place not mine.

21:19.347 --> 21:20.178
Where are they?

21:24.017 --> 21:25.042
They drove to Lyon.

21:30.610 --> 21:31.858
Dad said mom was fine.

21:32.850 --> 21:34.452
They just went for a check up.

21:40.466 --> 21:41.747
What happened to your leg?

21:45.683 --> 21:46.484
I'm tired.

21:47.698 --> 21:49.553
I need you to keep watch.

21:53.010 --> 21:54.418
I haven't got a choice.

21:59.666 --> 22:00.466
Jacques.

22:02.578 --> 22:03.538
Lyon is down.

23:24.178 --> 23:25.139
Nothing but cold.

24:51.121 --> 24:52.498
You idiot.

27:23.955 --> 27:25.427
Jacques, let me in!

27:31.825 --> 27:32.752
Kara!

27:32.754 --> 27:33.776
Kara!

27:33.778 --> 27:34.707
Kara!

29:08.402 --> 29:09.778
What did you do?

29:19.058 --> 29:20.306
What did you do?

30:49.617 --> 30:50.994
You're just a common thief,

30:54.418 --> 30:55.731
a lying thief.

31:06.738 --> 31:07.538
Now what?

31:11.697 --> 31:14.479
We get through the night.

31:14.481 --> 31:16.082
And hope
they don't break in.

31:17.170 --> 31:18.227
They won't.

31:20.850 --> 31:23.154
The man seemed pretty keen.

31:28.497 --> 31:29.522
Then I'll shoot him.

31:34.738 --> 31:36.304
You need to give back
what you stole from them

31:36.306 --> 31:37.618
and get the fuck out my house.

31:39.921 --> 31:41.456
They won't leave.

32:01.138 --> 32:03.378
There is a blanket upstairs.

32:05.426 --> 32:08.147
What would you do just waltz
up there and get it, huh?

32:09.970 --> 32:12.016
And I haven't got a choice.

32:12.018 --> 32:13.104
We don't have a choice.

32:13.106 --> 32:13.907
We.

32:46.706 --> 32:47.538
Stop.

32:57.073 --> 32:57.841
Stop.

33:08.785 --> 33:10.736
Jacques, I can't.

33:10.738 --> 33:13.075
No, I can't, Kara.

33:15.377 --> 33:16.306
This is not me.

33:17.842 --> 33:18.448
I don't do this.

33:18.450 --> 33:20.178
I can't do this.

33:22.225 --> 33:23.151
I studied IT.

33:23.153 --> 33:24.179
Do you know what that is?

33:25.138 --> 33:26.737
I fix computers.

33:28.402 --> 33:29.936
And you want me to go out there

33:29.938 --> 33:31.183
and take on two mountain men,

33:31.185 --> 33:32.466
so you can have a blanket.

33:34.705 --> 33:35.698
Then we both freeze.

33:36.658 --> 33:37.523
No.

33:40.080 --> 33:41.459
You go and give
them what they want,

33:42.769 --> 33:43.665
and let them leave.

33:45.265 --> 33:48.463
I'll get my father
to pay you, huh

33:48.465 --> 33:50.514
double, three fold
whatever you want.

33:51.601 --> 33:53.361
Just give 'em that
money, so they can go.

33:54.449 --> 33:56.371
Your father is not
coming back, Jacques.

34:06.225 --> 34:09.137
And what about
your parents, huh?

34:10.801 --> 34:12.179
Suppose they're lying face down

34:13.522 --> 34:15.058
in a Russian ditch somewhere.

34:16.978 --> 34:17.938
Ukrainian.

35:12.626 --> 35:14.098
It's always you.

35:18.322 --> 35:19.602
It's always you.

35:30.865 --> 35:34.738
I could spend you in London
as fast as three minutes.

35:37.457 --> 35:39.922
Now a hundred of you
wouldn't even buy an apple.

37:02.097 --> 37:03.027
Fuck.

43:18.385 --> 43:19.666
Kara.

43:24.176 --> 43:25.105
Kara.

43:41.873 --> 43:42.481
Kara.

44:08.401 --> 44:13.137
Let me do it.

44:33.330 --> 44:34.801
Kara.

45:00.177 --> 45:02.065
The blade needs to go deep.

46:34.193 --> 46:36.654
Who is that asshole?

46:36.656 --> 46:37.872
Hmm, answer me!

46:41.905 --> 46:42.706
Answer me!

46:49.456 --> 46:50.352
My husband.

47:00.528 --> 47:01.682
You have one bullet.

47:07.697 --> 47:11.694
Michel!

47:11.696 --> 47:13.614
She's in here!

47:18.769 --> 47:20.303
I won't be fucked
about by you anymore!

47:20.305 --> 47:21.710
You hear me you French cunt!

47:27.665 --> 47:29.902
You wanna die, is that it, huh?

47:29.904 --> 47:30.830
Who wants to die?

47:30.832 --> 47:31.887
Who wants to fucking die?

47:31.889 --> 47:33.358
How about this one, huh?

47:33.360 --> 47:35.119
How about I shoot
her in the twat?

47:35.121 --> 47:36.494
How would you like her then?

47:36.496 --> 47:37.583
Yeah, go on.

47:37.585 --> 47:38.606
Yes!

47:38.608 --> 47:40.401
Alright, again, huh!

47:41.169 --> 47:43.087
Merci, come on!

48:14.513 --> 48:15.986
I'm fucking hungry!

48:25.617 --> 48:26.862
Don't open it!

48:26.864 --> 48:27.537
Shut up!

48:29.104 --> 48:30.225
Shut the fuck up!

48:36.465 --> 48:37.198
Don't do it!

48:37.200 --> 48:38.097
Shut up!

49:01.041 --> 49:02.510
You idiot.

49:02.512 --> 49:03.857
You want your money, huh?

49:05.905 --> 49:07.855
You get the fuck out my house.

49:08.945 --> 49:11.727
First, you were gonna fucking
shoot me, you understand?

49:11.729 --> 49:15.054
We just want the money.

49:23.505 --> 49:24.591
Give me it.

49:24.593 --> 49:25.520
Give me it.

49:27.984 --> 49:28.881
Give me it.

49:29.968 --> 49:31.122
I've got it.

49:31.889 --> 49:32.818
Here it is.

49:43.344 --> 49:45.840
Let me see you come and get it!

50:27.825 --> 50:28.498
Hey.

50:30.000 --> 50:30.930
Hey, we had a deal.

50:31.793 --> 50:33.807
We had a...

50:33.809 --> 50:34.610
Fuck.

50:35.984 --> 50:36.785
Fuck.

51:14.159 --> 51:16.146
I guess, he must
really love you.

51:26.768 --> 51:27.857
What did he do to you?

51:38.288 --> 51:39.120
Did he hurt you?

51:47.217 --> 51:49.103
Do you want me to open that door

51:49.105 --> 51:50.097
and leave with him?

51:53.456 --> 51:54.865
What do you think will happen?

51:57.744 --> 51:58.545
Hmm?

52:01.073 --> 52:02.994
Believe it or not
this flu kills.

52:05.744 --> 52:07.982
We will look after his brother,

52:07.984 --> 52:09.297
and then I will look after him.

52:10.640 --> 52:12.656
And that will be the
last thing I ever do.

52:15.345 --> 52:16.977
And you will get
your house back.

52:33.839 --> 52:35.217
Why did you take the money?

52:46.448 --> 52:47.537
Hmm?

52:55.665 --> 52:57.265
What if this ends?

53:27.569 --> 53:29.489
I'm leaving.

53:33.456 --> 53:34.706
This is your house.

53:38.544 --> 53:39.345
No.

53:42.832 --> 53:44.305
It's my parent's house.

53:50.031 --> 53:51.345
My parents are dead.

01:01:57.487 --> 01:01:58.320
