00:01.002 --> 00:02.337
<i>Previously on Riverdale...</i>

00:02.545 --> 00:05.298
<i>The story is about a town,
once wholesome and innocent,</i>

00:05.507 --> 00:08.635
<i>now forever changed
by the mysterious murder
of Jason Blossom...</i>

00:08.843 --> 00:10.220
This is our insurance.

00:10.428 --> 00:11.930
In case everything
goes to hell.

00:12.138 --> 00:13.264
Stash it. Keep it safe.

00:13.473 --> 00:14.933
I talked it over
with Mrs. Cooper.

00:15.141 --> 00:16.059
She's a part of this?

00:16.267 --> 00:18.436
She's gonna keep FP busy
while we search his trailer

00:18.645 --> 00:20.855
to find anything
that links FP to Jason.

00:21.064 --> 00:22.607
<i>Or, more importantly,
FP to my dad.</i>

00:22.816 --> 00:24.109
We went to your
dad's trailer...

00:24.317 --> 00:25.902
- Why would you guys do that?
- We were wrong.

00:26.111 --> 00:27.529
We didn't find anything.

00:27.737 --> 00:29.781
- You went behind
my back, Archie?
- Jug...

00:29.990 --> 00:31.116
My dad just told Mayor McCoy

00:31.324 --> 00:32.826
- about your dad.
- What about my dad?

00:33.034 --> 00:35.537
<i>He was just arrested.
For the murder of
Jason Blossom.</i>

00:39.958 --> 00:41.418
Someone planted the gun...

00:41.626 --> 00:43.628
Jason's murder weapon,
in a closet in FP's trailer.

00:43.837 --> 00:46.047
It wasn't there when
we searched for it.
He's being framed, Betty.

00:46.256 --> 00:47.590
Well, maybe you didn't see it.

00:47.799 --> 00:49.634
We're not talking about
the <i>Vogue</i> closet here, Bee...

00:49.843 --> 00:51.052
Well, maybe you looked
in the wrong one.

00:51.261 --> 00:53.638
It's a trailer
with literally one closet.

00:53.847 --> 00:55.390
There was no lockbox. No gun.

00:55.598 --> 00:58.393
Whatever Sheriff Keller
is saying he found,
it wasn't there.

00:58.601 --> 01:01.354
Look, we need to tell Jughead
his dad's innocent.
Where is Jughead?

01:01.563 --> 01:02.522
I don't know.

01:02.731 --> 01:05.525
I tried calling him.
I left him messages.
He's not answering his phone.

01:05.734 --> 01:07.235
In the meantime...

01:07.444 --> 01:09.154
- Should we talk
to Sheriff Keller?
No.

01:09.362 --> 01:10.655
Not until we tell our parents.

01:10.864 --> 01:12.741
That we broke into
FP's trailer?

01:12.949 --> 01:14.200
My dad will know what to do.

01:14.409 --> 01:16.119
You did what?

01:16.327 --> 01:18.788
We had to make sure
FP wasn't involved
in Jason's murder.

01:18.997 --> 01:20.623
And now we know the truth.
He was.

01:20.832 --> 01:22.792
What? Mom, no.
We just told you.

01:23.001 --> 01:25.003
- The gun was planted.
- By whoever killed Jason.

01:25.211 --> 01:26.379
Couldn't you have
just missed it?

01:26.588 --> 01:29.758
Yeah, excuse me if I trust
the detection skills
of an officer of the law

01:29.966 --> 01:31.676
over three amateur sleuths.

01:31.885 --> 01:34.345
Mom, you're the one who
asked Veronica to break in!

01:34.554 --> 01:35.555
- Excuse me?
- What!

01:35.764 --> 01:37.140
- Alice?
- Actually...

01:37.348 --> 01:39.059
I approached Mrs. Cooper.

01:39.267 --> 01:42.353
I had to know if FP
was involved, and if he
was connected to my dad.

01:42.562 --> 01:44.230
A gun was found.

01:44.439 --> 01:47.275
FP is the killer.
Case closed. We're leaving.

01:47.484 --> 01:48.610
There was no gun!

01:48.818 --> 01:52.781
Son, this isn't
petty theft or a bar fight
we're talking about, Archie.

01:52.989 --> 01:54.032
This is murder.

01:54.240 --> 01:55.784
Okay, fine. Then we'll go
to the sheriff without you.

01:55.992 --> 01:59.537
Archie, you entered
FP's residence illegally.

01:59.746 --> 02:01.289
So whatever you did
or did not find there

02:01.498 --> 02:03.458
would be inadmissible
in a court of law.

02:03.666 --> 02:04.959
I don't care
what happens to me.

02:05.126 --> 02:07.462
I do care. FP may have
ruined Jughead's life,

02:07.670 --> 02:08.838
I'm not gonna
let him ruin yours.

02:43.832 --> 02:44.999
Hi, Mom.

02:47.043 --> 02:48.211
Hey, guess what?

02:50.296 --> 02:53.800
I got a bus ticket to Toledo.

02:55.260 --> 02:57.887
Yeah. I thought I'd come see
you and Jellybean for a while.

02:59.472 --> 03:01.057
I could crash on the couch.

03:05.019 --> 03:06.146
Yeah.

03:09.440 --> 03:10.567
Mmm-hmm.

03:11.776 --> 03:13.027
No. I...

03:14.612 --> 03:16.072
No, I understand.

03:17.448 --> 03:18.533
Look, I...

03:19.659 --> 03:21.119
Forget I said anything, okay?

03:22.453 --> 03:23.580
All right. Bye.

03:27.667 --> 03:30.003
<i>I changed my mind
about Toledo.</i>

03:30.503 --> 03:33.882
Can you just
put me on whatever
the next bus out of town is?

03:34.090 --> 03:36.050
I don't even care
where it's going.

03:36.259 --> 03:39.846
Citrusville, Florida.
Leaves tomorrow
morning at 6:00.

03:40.054 --> 03:41.181
Great.

03:42.932 --> 03:46.686
Lobby closes
in fifteen minutes,
reopens at 5:30.

03:49.981 --> 03:51.482
Mom?
What are you looking for?

03:51.691 --> 03:53.776
- Our passports.
- Why?

03:53.985 --> 03:56.988
Because Lord knows
what FP is going to say,
now that he's behind bars.

03:58.198 --> 04:01.284
So, you do think Daddy
hired him to kill Jason?

04:01.492 --> 04:02.827
Honey, I don't know.

04:03.036 --> 04:04.954
But, regardless of that,
we are known associates

04:05.163 --> 04:06.956
of the man
who killed Jason Blossom.

04:07.540 --> 04:09.834
Your father may have had
something to do with that.

04:10.043 --> 04:13.296
Maybe not. But either way,
we need to be ready.

04:14.214 --> 04:15.548
Ready to do what?

04:16.424 --> 04:18.843
Run away? Like we ran away
from New York?

04:19.052 --> 04:21.429
- We're gonna look guilty.
- Baby, we are guilty!

04:23.139 --> 04:24.557
I'm guilty.

04:24.766 --> 04:27.477
I bribed the Mayor
to get the drive-in land,

04:27.685 --> 04:30.355
forged your signature,
paid off the Serpents.

04:31.147 --> 04:33.608
If that comes out, just...

04:34.692 --> 04:36.903
Pack a bag, okay?

04:37.737 --> 04:38.905
Just in case.

04:48.331 --> 04:49.374
Come on.

04:49.582 --> 04:52.669
From what he said in the hall,
it seems like he wants to get
to his mom in Ohio.

04:53.628 --> 04:55.380
- Anything?
- No.

04:55.797 --> 04:57.173
Maybe his phone died.

04:58.216 --> 05:01.552
Or maybe,
the only friends he has
just completely betrayed him.

05:03.346 --> 05:05.014
- Is that him?
- No, it's Veronica.

05:05.640 --> 05:07.100
Hey. You okay?

05:07.308 --> 05:10.937
Not really.
My mom's spiraling,
and I'm on the verge.

05:11.354 --> 05:13.523
I just wanted to talk.
Where are you?

05:14.107 --> 05:15.608
I'm with Betty.
We're looking for Jughead.

05:15.817 --> 05:16.651
Wait.

05:17.402 --> 05:19.404
You and Betty went
on a manhunt without me?

05:19.612 --> 05:20.280
I'll come meet you.

05:20.488 --> 05:21.406
<i>We're at the bus station,</i>

05:21.614 --> 05:22.490
<i>but it's shut down
for the night.</i>

05:22.865 --> 05:26.077
What's the one place in town
that's open 24 hours?

05:26.286 --> 05:27.745
Hint, we were just there.

05:31.749 --> 05:33.710
- Told you.
- Jug.

05:39.507 --> 05:41.801
Jug, we're so sorry...

05:42.927 --> 05:44.137
About everything.

05:47.390 --> 05:50.143
Juggy, we screwed up.
We all did.

05:51.602 --> 05:53.146
Breaking into your
dad's trailer was wrong,

05:53.354 --> 05:54.814
but at least
some good came out of it.

05:55.023 --> 05:57.525
Pretty sure my dad was
just arrested for murder.

05:58.484 --> 06:01.571
That gun wasn't there
when we searched his trailer.

06:01.779 --> 06:03.406
Someone put it there
after we left.

06:07.660 --> 06:09.120
What are you talking about?

06:09.662 --> 06:11.039
The gun we found
in your trailer

06:11.247 --> 06:13.249
matched the bullet
that killed Jason Blossom.

06:16.961 --> 06:18.171
So, did you know him well,

06:18.379 --> 06:20.256
or did you just do it
for kicks?

06:25.470 --> 06:26.262
Last summer,

06:28.598 --> 06:30.308
<i>a redhead kid
comes up to me at the bar,</i>

06:30.516 --> 06:31.684
<i>the Whyte Wyrm.</i>

06:33.019 --> 06:36.439
<i>Said he was
planning to run away
with his pregnant girlfriend.</i>

06:36.647 --> 06:39.150
- Polly Cooper.
- So I would learn.

06:39.359 --> 06:42.362
He asked me to set him up
with a getaway car
and some cash.

06:43.196 --> 06:44.530
We made a deal.

06:45.239 --> 06:47.241
In exchange for some wheels,

06:48.743 --> 06:50.995
and a tidy sum, he would
make a delivery for me.

06:51.204 --> 06:52.663
<i>- Drugs?
- Mmm.</i>

06:53.873 --> 06:55.333
<i>I got him a station wagon,</i>

06:55.541 --> 06:57.210
<i>stashed some weed in the back.</i>

06:58.503 --> 06:59.379
<i>Then...</i>

07:00.588 --> 07:02.465
I put two and two together.

07:03.716 --> 07:05.843
Realized he was
Cliff Blossom's son.

07:07.303 --> 07:08.554
I thought...

07:09.972 --> 07:12.642
Kid like that has everything.

07:13.559 --> 07:15.603
Why in the hell does he need
a guy like me?

07:16.354 --> 07:18.231
Then he told me his plan.

07:19.440 --> 07:21.109
On July 4th,

07:21.317 --> 07:23.861
<i>his sister
was going to row him
across Sweetwater River,</i>

07:24.070 --> 07:26.656
<i>tip the boat,
and say he drowned.</i>

07:29.367 --> 07:31.244
<i>Once he made it
across the river,</i>

07:31.744 --> 07:34.872
I grabbed him before
he reached his getaway car,

07:35.081 --> 07:37.500
which he'd stashed
I don't know where.

07:40.044 --> 07:42.004
And then,
I took him to the Wyrm...

07:43.714 --> 07:44.924
Held him in the basement.

07:45.758 --> 07:47.677
I kept him tied up
and worked out my plan.

07:47.885 --> 07:49.303
Which was?

07:49.512 --> 07:52.098
Get word to Cliff Blossom
that his son was alive,

07:52.306 --> 07:53.891
and being held for ransom.

07:54.100 --> 07:56.894
Set up a drop-off point
for payment to get him back.

07:58.104 --> 07:59.689
Before I sent word to Blossom,

08:00.898 --> 08:02.483
the kid got loose.

08:03.734 --> 08:05.278
Tried to escape.

08:06.612 --> 08:10.032
And that's when you shot him
and stuffed him
in the freezer.

08:19.167 --> 08:20.710
Once things quieted down,

08:21.544 --> 08:24.589
<i>and your guys were done
dragging Sweetwater River
for his body,</i>

08:25.798 --> 08:27.258
that's when I dumped it.

08:28.342 --> 08:30.553
The only place
we'd already looked.

08:33.389 --> 08:35.641
You break into my house
and steal my files?

08:38.644 --> 08:39.896
Yeah, I did.

08:43.274 --> 08:45.026
<i>I even followed
my son and Betty Cooper</i>

08:45.234 --> 08:47.403
<i>to Jason's getaway car,
and torched it.</i>

08:51.282 --> 08:53.326
<i>You must've thought
you're real smart.</i>

08:54.994 --> 08:57.079
<i>Now, I wanna hear you say it.</i>

09:00.249 --> 09:02.502
Did you kill Jason Blossom?

09:12.803 --> 09:13.804
Excuse me, sir.

09:14.013 --> 09:15.139
We need to see Sheriff Keller.

09:15.348 --> 09:17.016
There's been a huge mistake.

09:17.225 --> 09:19.810
Sheriff, we need to
talk to you about FP Jones.

09:20.019 --> 09:21.312
- What about him?
- He's innocent.

09:21.521 --> 09:22.605
He's being framed.

09:23.189 --> 09:24.774
Then why did he just confess?

10:02.812 --> 10:05.898
Polly, the most incredible
thing has happened.

10:11.821 --> 10:13.906
He killed Jason, not...

10:20.413 --> 10:21.622
I went to the station.

10:22.582 --> 10:23.916
I looked our son's killer
in the eye.

10:30.548 --> 10:32.008
Finally, we'll have peace.

10:33.884 --> 10:35.303
Jason will have peace.

10:36.929 --> 10:40.057
And we...
We can all start over.

10:40.725 --> 10:41.684
All of us.

10:49.358 --> 10:52.403
The police report said
FP worked alone.

10:52.903 --> 10:55.364
No mention
of your dad, Ronnie.
That's good news, right?

10:55.573 --> 10:57.158
I can't
stop thinking that...

10:57.950 --> 11:00.703
Maybe my dad hired
another Serpent
to plant that gun.

11:04.123 --> 11:07.043
It's surreal, isn't it?
How's Jughead doing?

11:07.710 --> 11:08.336
Not good.

11:08.544 --> 11:10.171
He's not coming in today.
He's at the station.

11:10.379 --> 11:12.590
- Being grilled by your dad.
- Who's just doing his job.

11:12.798 --> 11:14.133
I mean, of course he's gonna
ask Jughead questions.

11:14.342 --> 11:16.385
Okay, well,
he's wasting his time, Kev.

11:16.594 --> 11:18.596
Because FP didn't kill Jason.

11:18.804 --> 11:21.390
- Betty, he confessed.
- Or he was coerced.

11:22.308 --> 11:25.269
Or he's protecting someone,
maybe a Serpent.

11:26.312 --> 11:28.022
My mom saw him
and Joaquin together...

11:28.230 --> 11:31.692
Don't! Do not drag
my boyfriend into this.

11:32.985 --> 11:34.236
What're you...

11:34.445 --> 11:35.738
- Oh, no.
- What?

11:38.407 --> 11:40.284
What happened to him
not coming in today?

11:59.011 --> 12:00.471
I'm sorry, Cheryl.

12:12.942 --> 12:14.610
Enough!

12:16.570 --> 12:19.573
Mr. Jones, you need
to come with me. Right now.

12:19.782 --> 12:21.992
He was apologizing.
He didn't do anything wrong!

12:30.876 --> 12:33.921
- Cheryl?
- I barely touched him.

12:43.347 --> 12:45.057
It's not his fault, Cheryl.

12:46.392 --> 12:48.602
Even if his dad
did do it, it's...

12:48.811 --> 12:51.939
Everybody keeps
coming up to me,

12:52.148 --> 12:54.191
and hugging me,

12:54.400 --> 12:55.860
and telling me that
I must be so relieved

12:56.068 --> 12:58.404
that my brother's killer
has finally been caught.

12:59.822 --> 13:01.657
That this nightmare is over.

13:06.370 --> 13:08.164
Then why doesn't it
feel that way?

13:20.009 --> 13:21.469
What happened in there?

13:21.677 --> 13:23.721
My second interrogation
of the day.

13:24.722 --> 13:25.890
Don't know who's
more of a dick,

13:26.098 --> 13:27.266
Keller or Weatherbee.

13:27.475 --> 13:29.518
Don't listen to them.
Everyone else is wrong.

13:29.727 --> 13:32.521
Your dad's innocent, and
we just need to prove it, Jug.

13:32.730 --> 13:35.191
Who killed him, then, Betty?

13:36.317 --> 13:37.526
Tell me.

13:38.903 --> 13:41.280
If it wasn't my dad,
who killed Jason Blossom?

13:41.989 --> 13:43.908
He said he did it,
and you know what?

13:44.116 --> 13:45.659
I've been waiting
my whole life

13:45.826 --> 13:47.703
for that man
to do the right thing,

13:47.912 --> 13:49.038
and I'm done.

13:50.790 --> 13:52.458
- You should be, too.
- Jug.

13:59.006 --> 14:00.674
Yes, I... I appreciate it.

14:03.427 --> 14:04.678
That was Weatherbee.

14:04.887 --> 14:06.847
He's concerned for
Jug's personal safety.

14:07.056 --> 14:08.933
After what happened
with Cheryl,

14:09.141 --> 14:10.851
he's worried about the other
students' reaction to it.

14:11.060 --> 14:14.021
Thinks Jughead should finish
the semester from home.

14:14.188 --> 14:16.440
Jughead's getting kicked out
because Cheryl pummeled him.

14:16.649 --> 14:17.608
How is that fair?

14:18.567 --> 14:21.529
- It's not.
- Well, can we call, I don't
know, the school board?

14:21.737 --> 14:25.950
Son, FP may spend
decades in prison,

14:26.158 --> 14:27.451
potentially the rest
of his life.

14:27.660 --> 14:29.537
We gotta think
of a long-term solution.

14:29.745 --> 14:31.455
We are the long-term solution.

14:31.664 --> 14:34.083
That's not how it works, okay?
I'm not his legal guardian.

14:34.291 --> 14:35.501
Oh, good thing mom's a lawyer.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.795
Archie, my priority
is keeping you safe.

14:38.003 --> 14:40.005
Keep me safe
from who? Jughead?

14:40.214 --> 14:41.340
Are you kidding me, Dad?

14:41.549 --> 14:42.633
No, from whatever trouble

14:42.842 --> 14:44.134
seems to follow
the Jones' around,

14:44.343 --> 14:47.054
wherever they go,
whatever they do.

14:47.263 --> 14:48.639
Hell, maybe you should
go to Chicago

14:48.848 --> 14:50.015
and live with your mom.

14:53.018 --> 14:55.229
It's not even something
I was considering, Dad.

14:55.437 --> 14:57.648
But you know what?
Maybe I should.

14:57.857 --> 15:00.192
Hey, if it'll keep you
out of trouble,
I'm all for it.

15:05.281 --> 15:06.407
Hey, Jug.

15:07.992 --> 15:09.952
I'm gonna sleep
in the garage tonight. Okay?

15:10.786 --> 15:11.537
Jug...

15:42.526 --> 15:43.944
Did you hear that?

15:44.153 --> 15:45.696
Mom, what are you
doing with that?

15:45.905 --> 15:47.823
Get behind me.
Be ready to dial 911.

15:59.460 --> 16:01.879
Don't move.

16:02.087 --> 16:03.422
Hands where I can see them.

16:07.551 --> 16:08.761
Don't shoot, Alice.

16:08.969 --> 16:09.887
- Dad!
- Hal!

16:11.889 --> 16:13.849
These are
Sheriff Keller's files

16:14.058 --> 16:16.894
about the Blossom
murder investigation.

16:17.102 --> 16:19.104
How did you get these, Dad?

16:19.313 --> 16:20.439
<i>I broke into his house</i>

16:20.648 --> 16:21.774
<i>the night
of the last drive-in,</i>

16:21.982 --> 16:23.233
<i>and I took them.</i>

16:23.442 --> 16:24.526
Well, that's impossible.

16:24.735 --> 16:26.737
FP Jones already
confessed to that.

16:26.946 --> 16:28.405
Well, I have no idea
why he would do that,

16:28.614 --> 16:29.448
because it was me.

16:29.657 --> 16:30.908
That's why I'm here.

16:31.075 --> 16:32.952
To destroy any evidence
that could lead back to me.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.787
Wait, that doesn't
make any sense.

16:34.995 --> 16:37.790
Why would FP fess up to
something he didn't even do?

16:37.998 --> 16:39.750
Yeah, I'm not thinking
about FP right now.

16:39.959 --> 16:41.919
I'd like to know why
your father is stealing

16:42.127 --> 16:44.588
and destroying evidence
in a murder investigation.

16:44.797 --> 16:46.340
Look, I was worried
that the investigation

16:46.548 --> 16:50.052
would get back to Polly,
somehow. To us.

16:50.719 --> 16:53.263
And somehow Sheriff Keller
would figure out
the connection

16:53.472 --> 16:56.392
between our family
and the Blossoms.

16:56.600 --> 16:58.644
And he would think that
there was some kind of motive.

16:58.852 --> 17:02.648
Wait, you mean about
Great-Grandpappy Cooper
being murdered by a Blossom?

17:06.568 --> 17:07.444
Betty...

17:08.821 --> 17:13.033
Your great-grandfather wasn't
just murdered by a Blossom.

17:14.618 --> 17:16.245
He was a Blossom.

17:19.832 --> 17:22.626
After the murder,
our family severed ties

17:22.835 --> 17:24.336
with the Blossoms
and their name,

17:24.545 --> 17:26.714
and we took a new one.
"Cooper."

17:28.173 --> 17:29.299
I'm...

17:31.218 --> 17:32.845
A Blossom?

17:33.721 --> 17:35.431
Polly is a Blossom,

17:38.183 --> 17:41.103
which makes her and Jason

17:41.854 --> 17:43.731
relatives by blood.

17:47.109 --> 17:50.112
- Which is why you wanted to...
- Yeah.

17:51.030 --> 17:52.489
Alice, that's why.

17:54.825 --> 17:56.285
Oh, my God, Hal.

17:56.493 --> 17:58.328
If you're willing to send
our daughter away

17:58.537 --> 18:01.582
to keep her away from Jason...

18:01.790 --> 18:05.169
How far would the Blossoms go
to keep them apart?

18:05.836 --> 18:07.629
We need to get Polly
out of that house.

18:19.850 --> 18:22.186
Don't bother calling the cops.
We're not staying. Polly!

18:22.394 --> 18:24.313
What the hell
is going on here, Alice?

18:24.521 --> 18:25.647
It's the middle of the night.

18:25.856 --> 18:28.150
Oh, sorry to disrupt
the witching hour
at Thornhill.

18:28.358 --> 18:29.610
Polly, honey, are you okay?

18:29.818 --> 18:31.820
Yeah, I'm fine.
Betty, what's going on?

18:32.029 --> 18:33.405
We're here to bring
you home, Pol.

18:33.614 --> 18:34.740
She's not leaving us.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.658
She chose
to live here, remember?

18:36.867 --> 18:38.494
With a mentally stable family.

18:38.702 --> 18:41.121
Oh, I know all about
your family, Penelope.

18:41.330 --> 18:43.540
- And the incest.
- What?

18:43.749 --> 18:45.292
What incest?

18:45.501 --> 18:49.129
Hal's grandfather wasn't
just your grandpappy's
murder victim.

18:50.339 --> 18:54.009
They were brothers,
which made him a Blossom.

18:54.218 --> 18:55.886
Just like Hal.

18:56.095 --> 18:57.805
- Yeah, so what?
- "So what?"

18:58.013 --> 18:59.264
So, everything,

18:59.848 --> 19:03.060
starting with FP's confession,
has a few gaping holes in it.

19:03.268 --> 19:06.980
He's being used by someone
with a crazy motive,

19:07.189 --> 19:09.858
for example, hiding incest.

19:10.067 --> 19:12.736
You were disgusted that
Jason and Polly were dating

19:12.945 --> 19:14.446
because they were related.

19:14.655 --> 19:16.532
Nothing could be
more purely Blossom

19:16.740 --> 19:18.450
than those babies.

19:19.243 --> 19:21.411
Okay, what is wrong
with you people?

19:21.620 --> 19:23.705
Will you just spare us
the middle-class morality.

19:23.914 --> 19:25.499
It's not like they were
brother and sister.

19:25.707 --> 19:28.127
They were, what,
third cousins.

19:28.627 --> 19:30.879
You think I killed my son?

19:31.088 --> 19:33.090
That's it.
Polly, we are out of here.

19:34.091 --> 19:38.512
Enough of this Doctor Moreau
experimentation in breeding
and eugenics.

19:38.720 --> 19:39.805
It's over!

19:40.806 --> 19:42.057
Betty, let's go.

19:42.266 --> 19:43.934
You've made
a grave error, little girl.

19:45.644 --> 19:47.479
No, I don't think so.

19:47.688 --> 19:50.023
And I'm not gonna stop
until I prove it.

19:58.949 --> 20:02.494
Juggy. Jug.
Wake up, we gotta go to Pop's.

20:04.788 --> 20:07.332
<i>Archie asked me to look
into your father's case.</i>

20:07.541 --> 20:10.711
I went down to the station,
and passed myself off
as his attorney

20:10.919 --> 20:12.796
to try to get as much
information as I could.

20:13.881 --> 20:15.007
How's it looking, Mom?

20:15.215 --> 20:19.052
Well, unfortunately,
between FP's list of priors,

20:19.261 --> 20:20.596
the anonymous tip,

20:20.804 --> 20:22.097
and the possession
of the murder weapon...

20:22.306 --> 20:24.349
Don't forget
that pesky confession.

20:24.558 --> 20:25.726
Things look pretty bad.

20:27.144 --> 20:28.645
I was with him all night,

20:28.854 --> 20:30.439
and he never once
budged from his story.

20:33.275 --> 20:35.068
Well, if nothing else,

20:35.277 --> 20:36.904
at least
he's an honest murderer.

20:37.112 --> 20:38.155
- Jug...
- Right?

20:38.822 --> 20:44.036
Oh, also,
who is Joaquin DeSantos?

20:44.244 --> 20:46.455
Joaquin? As in
Kevin's boyfriend?

20:48.457 --> 20:50.292
He was FP's one phone call.

20:52.252 --> 20:53.295
Jughead,

20:54.046 --> 20:57.799
my advice to you is,
go and see your father.

20:58.008 --> 20:59.718
Tell him everything
you wanna say.

20:59.927 --> 21:02.638
Once he's arraigned,
things tend to move
pretty quickly,

21:02.846 --> 21:04.473
and there won't be
anything left to do.

21:04.681 --> 21:06.475
So, this might be
your last chance.

21:09.102 --> 21:11.772
When Archie told me about
his little plan to help you,

21:14.316 --> 21:17.110
get you on your feet,
and working with Fred,

21:18.362 --> 21:22.282
deep down,
I knew it was a mistake.

21:22.491 --> 21:23.742
Should have listened
to your gut.

21:24.493 --> 21:25.494
You really had me.

21:30.123 --> 21:31.458
Cleaning the trailer.

21:31.667 --> 21:33.710
Convincing me that you
had quit drinking.

21:37.756 --> 21:42.469
I was so happy,
for the first time in so long.

21:44.096 --> 21:45.931
You paid attention to me.

21:46.556 --> 21:47.849
Let's be honest.

21:48.058 --> 21:50.102
The only reason
you even read my manuscript

21:50.310 --> 21:51.687
about Jason's murder,

21:51.895 --> 21:53.981
was to make sure
I wasn't onto you.

21:55.065 --> 21:57.109
And you didn't want to take me

21:57.317 --> 22:00.153
to Toledo to get the family
back together.

22:01.071 --> 22:02.572
You wanted to get away.

22:03.282 --> 22:05.033
You wanted to run away.

22:05.242 --> 22:07.911
I did what I had to do!
What I always do!

22:08.120 --> 22:10.998
Are you even sorry?

22:17.045 --> 22:18.797
Sorry I got caught.

22:21.717 --> 22:22.718
We done?

22:25.387 --> 22:26.722
Look at me, Jughead!

22:32.352 --> 22:33.854
Never come back here!

22:35.272 --> 22:36.565
Understand?

22:44.906 --> 22:45.574
Got it.

22:54.666 --> 22:56.460
He called Joaquin?

22:57.169 --> 22:58.670
Why not Jughead?

22:58.879 --> 23:00.630
Or your dad? Or a lawyer?

23:00.839 --> 23:02.591
- It's weird.
- What does Betty think?

23:02.799 --> 23:04.509
She thinks it's weird.

23:05.510 --> 23:09.514
Joaquin might know
if FP was hired to kill Jason,

23:09.723 --> 23:11.016
if it was my father...

23:12.976 --> 23:14.978
I need to see
this through to the end.

23:15.187 --> 23:17.272
We know FP
used his call from jail
to get in touch with you.

23:17.481 --> 23:18.940
What did he say?

23:19.149 --> 23:20.442
It was basically
just a warning.

23:20.650 --> 23:21.777
Said to lay low.

23:21.985 --> 23:24.571
No one uses their one call
to say "lay low."

23:24.780 --> 23:26.406
Joaquin, do you
know something?

23:27.657 --> 23:29.201
I'm not talking to you
as your boyfriend,

23:29.409 --> 23:30.827
I'm talking to you
as the sheriff's son.

23:31.036 --> 23:32.579
Did FP kill Jason?

23:38.335 --> 23:39.086
Yeah.

23:39.920 --> 23:42.297
- I mean, I... I assume.
- Oh, my God.

23:42.506 --> 23:43.715
Did you see him
pull the trigger?

23:43.924 --> 23:45.133
No, no. God, no...

23:45.342 --> 23:46.593
Then why
do you think he did it?

23:50.555 --> 23:53.141
On July 11th,
I got a phone call

23:53.350 --> 23:54.935
in the middle of the night
from FP.

23:56.520 --> 23:58.063
Said he needed help
with some clean-up job

23:58.271 --> 23:59.564
at the Whyte Wyrm.

23:59.773 --> 24:00.857
What job?

24:02.192 --> 24:05.695
The basement of the Whyte Wyrm
is off limits to everyone,

24:07.155 --> 24:08.573
but that's where I met FP,

24:08.782 --> 24:11.618
and that's where I saw...

24:16.915 --> 24:18.083
<i>He'd been shot.</i>

24:19.376 --> 24:22.003
<i>I never asked FP
if he did it. I just...</i>

24:22.212 --> 24:24.881
<i>I mean, I was terrified.
I... I just assumed.</i>

24:25.882 --> 24:27.467
<i>We stashed the body
in the freezer,</i>

24:29.886 --> 24:33.723
<i>cleaned up the mess,
got rid of any evidence...</i>

24:39.521 --> 24:41.857
You are a criminal.

24:42.065 --> 24:47.028
Joaquin, FP has done jobs
for my dad, Hiram Lodge,
in the past.

24:48.363 --> 24:50.949
Do you think killing Jason
was one of them?

24:53.452 --> 24:55.620
There was one time
I overheard a conversation

24:55.829 --> 24:57.164
between FP and Mustang...

24:57.372 --> 25:01.251
- Who's Mustang?
- He's another Serpent.

25:02.252 --> 25:04.087
The only other guy
who knew about the clean-up.

25:04.838 --> 25:06.631
The guy you got
into a fight with at the Wyrm.

25:08.425 --> 25:12.554
<i>I heard him tell FP
something about some rich guy.</i>

25:12.762 --> 25:13.889
<i>I don't know who.</i>

25:14.097 --> 25:15.891
- Where is Mustang?
- No, no, no, no.

25:16.099 --> 25:17.601
You do not want to go see him.

25:17.809 --> 25:19.227
Yes, I do.

25:19.436 --> 25:20.979
And you're going
to take us. Or...

25:21.188 --> 25:23.356
Or I'm going to tell my dad
about your little
clean-up job.

25:25.734 --> 25:27.944
I'm so glad
that you're home, Pol.

25:28.987 --> 25:30.739
And that you're safe.

25:30.947 --> 25:33.825
And that the babies
are okay and healthy.

25:36.036 --> 25:38.413
But God,
everything else...

25:39.581 --> 25:41.208
Is the worst.

25:49.257 --> 25:51.468
Betty, I saw my dad.

25:52.219 --> 25:53.261
You were right.

25:54.137 --> 25:55.722
He's hiding something.

26:07.108 --> 26:07.901
Not that much money

26:08.109 --> 26:09.778
in local crime
and villainy, huh?

26:09.986 --> 26:11.696
This is him, here.

26:15.784 --> 26:18.995
Mustang? You here?

26:38.306 --> 26:39.307
Oh, my God.

26:48.692 --> 26:51.361
- I can't... I can't be here.
- Let's go.

26:51.570 --> 26:52.654
Call my dad.

27:03.707 --> 27:06.042
- Son...
- I'm okay. We both are.

27:06.751 --> 27:08.169
What were you doing here
in the first place?

27:08.378 --> 27:10.505
We knew Mustang was a Serpent.
We just wanted to talk to him,

27:10.714 --> 27:12.382
to see if he knew
anything about FP.

27:12.591 --> 27:14.175
Veronica, this has to stop.

27:14.384 --> 27:15.885
- Why are you doing this?
- Mom.

27:16.094 --> 27:17.345
What do you think
happened in there?

27:17.554 --> 27:18.888
Likely an overdose.

27:19.097 --> 27:21.224
We're waiting to see
a time of death,

27:21.433 --> 27:22.726
but it wouldn't
surprise me at all

27:22.934 --> 27:23.893
if he was somehow involved
in Jason's murder,

27:24.102 --> 27:25.520
and was feeling the heat.

27:25.729 --> 27:27.480
And how'd you know
he even lived here?

27:30.483 --> 27:31.359
Sheriff...

27:34.154 --> 27:35.447
Found it under his bed.

27:38.867 --> 27:40.368
Hermione Lodge?

27:40.577 --> 27:41.953
Mind explaining to me
why your initials

27:42.162 --> 27:43.288
are on this bag?

27:45.206 --> 27:48.335
Not Hermione Lodge, Sheriff.

27:48.543 --> 27:50.003
- Hiram Lodge. My dad.
- Veronica!

27:50.211 --> 27:51.254
Mom...

27:52.088 --> 27:54.090
He was doing business
with the Serpents.

27:54.299 --> 27:55.383
And that's all we're saying

27:55.592 --> 27:57.177
until there's
an attorney present.

28:16.196 --> 28:18.239
This is exactly
what I didn't want to happen.

28:18.448 --> 28:20.992
If you stay on this path,
you will end up dead.

28:21.201 --> 28:22.619
Just like Jason Blossom.

28:24.120 --> 28:25.580
You gotta believe me.

28:25.789 --> 28:27.582
Okay? When I tell you
I'm trying to protect you.

28:27.791 --> 28:29.751
That is my job.

28:31.086 --> 28:32.754
It's the only one that counts.

28:38.968 --> 28:41.554
- Do you got that?
- Yes.

28:58.988 --> 29:01.866
Mom! Mom... Mom!

29:04.953 --> 29:07.706
It's okay. It's okay.

29:10.291 --> 29:13.461
You gotta tell your friends
to stop before they get hurt.

29:13.670 --> 29:15.630
You really don't know them
at all, do you?

29:17.006 --> 29:18.591
Just like I don't know you.

29:22.971 --> 29:24.639
- Joaquin?
- Yeah?

29:33.440 --> 29:34.607
I'm gonna miss you, Preppy...

29:43.283 --> 29:44.951
Look, I didn't want
to say this

29:45.160 --> 29:46.369
in front of your friends,

29:47.203 --> 29:48.872
but there's something else.

29:51.666 --> 29:53.501
My dad's been
lying to me his whole life,

29:53.710 --> 29:55.128
but he's never been
any good at it.

29:56.212 --> 29:57.756
I saw it in his eyes.

29:58.798 --> 30:01.134
- He didn't do it.
- So, why lie?

30:01.342 --> 30:02.510
Who is he protecting?

30:12.395 --> 30:14.397
Mommy, that last morning,

30:14.606 --> 30:16.608
before Jay-Jay
and I went to the river...

30:17.734 --> 30:19.486
Why were he and Daddy arguing?

30:21.863 --> 30:23.114
We've been over this.

30:25.492 --> 30:28.369
Your father dedicated himself
to grooming Jason

30:28.578 --> 30:30.079
to take over
the family business,

30:30.288 --> 30:32.290
- but in the end...
- He couldn't stomach it.

30:32.499 --> 30:34.125
When, really, I should have
been nurturing you.

30:35.335 --> 30:36.836
Because Jason never
had the stomach for any of it.

30:37.045 --> 30:39.422
But you... You're a Blossom.

30:40.757 --> 30:42.425
I remember. He told me.

30:50.183 --> 30:53.895
But why?
What couldn't he handle?

30:58.650 --> 31:01.569
So many questions, Cheryl...

31:02.779 --> 31:05.073
Okay, who can we rule out?

31:05.281 --> 31:06.241
My dad.

31:06.449 --> 31:09.327
We know why
he was acting so shady.

31:09.536 --> 31:10.662
- Hermione.
- Yeah.

31:10.870 --> 31:11.996
Veronica says
she's guilty of plenty,

31:12.205 --> 31:13.706
but not murder.
Plus, she has an alibi.

31:13.915 --> 31:15.542
She was in New York.

31:15.750 --> 31:17.210
So, that just
leaves Hiram Lodge...

31:17.418 --> 31:19.796
And Clifford
and Penelope Blossom...

31:23.550 --> 31:26.803
I think something
happened, Mommy.

31:27.011 --> 31:28.388
Whatever do you mean?

31:29.931 --> 31:32.433
If Daddy wasn't mad at Jason
about Polly,

31:32.642 --> 31:34.477
it must have been
about the business.

31:35.812 --> 31:37.730
I don't know if he heard
something he shouldn't have,

31:37.939 --> 31:39.899
or he saw something
he didn't like...

31:40.108 --> 31:41.860
You don't know
what you're saying...

31:42.527 --> 31:44.904
What was Jay-Jay
running away from?

31:46.447 --> 31:48.074
The business?

31:48.950 --> 31:49.993
Daddy?

31:52.662 --> 31:53.955
You?

32:00.128 --> 32:00.837
Ow!

32:06.134 --> 32:09.345
You think
your father killed
your brother?

32:09.554 --> 32:11.055
You think I did?

32:11.264 --> 32:13.308
You think we murdered him
and threw him in the river,

32:13.516 --> 32:16.811
because Jason knew
some deep, dark, horrible

32:17.020 --> 32:18.646
secret about our business?

32:19.856 --> 32:21.274
You want answers, Cheryl?

32:21.482 --> 32:23.026
Are you ready?

32:25.528 --> 32:27.030
There it is!

32:29.282 --> 32:34.037
There's the sticky,
dark, dirty truth.

32:34.579 --> 32:35.622
Maple syrup!

32:38.041 --> 32:39.709
Drown in it, why don't you?

32:44.339 --> 32:45.715
Well, what do we have here?

32:46.674 --> 32:48.468
You two just can't leave
well enough alone, can you?

32:48.635 --> 32:50.762
Mom, we know what
you're going to say.

32:51.554 --> 32:53.306
The police found
another dead body.

32:53.514 --> 32:54.390
Okay, maybe not that.

32:54.599 --> 32:55.767
A Southside Serpent

32:55.975 --> 32:57.518
and Sheriff Clueless
is convinced

32:57.727 --> 32:59.312
that he was working
with your father.

32:59.520 --> 33:01.940
He allegedly
committed suicide by overdose,

33:02.148 --> 33:03.775
and there was
a bag of money on-site

33:03.983 --> 33:05.360
that links him to Hiram Lodge.

33:05.568 --> 33:07.362
Everything is tied up
into a nice little bow.

33:08.613 --> 33:10.323
Too tidy, if you ask me.

33:14.369 --> 33:15.495
Kevin?

33:17.789 --> 33:20.458
Oh, okay.
We'll meet you there.

33:23.127 --> 33:24.504
Whatever it is
we're looking for,

33:24.712 --> 33:25.880
Joaquin didn't know
if it would help your dad,

33:26.089 --> 33:27.215
or make things worse.

33:27.423 --> 33:29.217
Um, guess
we're going to find out.

33:29.425 --> 33:31.260
And why did he wait
so long to tell us?

33:31.469 --> 33:33.054
FP called him from jail.

33:33.262 --> 33:34.722
Told him to forget
about their plan,

33:34.931 --> 33:37.892
some contingency plan.
He said it was too dangerous.

33:39.477 --> 33:40.687
Deja vu.

33:44.649 --> 33:45.984
Hey, right here.

34:08.965 --> 34:10.758
This is meant to help FP?

34:10.967 --> 34:14.345
I don't know. Looks like more
incriminating evidence to me.

34:14.554 --> 34:15.763
Yeah, this just confirms

34:15.972 --> 34:17.932
that my dad torched
Jason's getaway car.

34:18.141 --> 34:21.227
And that his confession
was true.

34:21.436 --> 34:24.355
Why would FP say Jason's
varsity jacket is dangerous?

34:24.564 --> 34:25.732
What could that mean?

34:25.940 --> 34:27.442
I can ask my father.

34:28.276 --> 34:29.360
He would know,

34:29.569 --> 34:30.820
considering we found
concrete proof

34:31.029 --> 34:33.531
that he hired
the Serpents to kill Jason.

34:34.699 --> 34:36.034
Which probably means

34:36.242 --> 34:39.203
that your dad
pulled the trigger, Jughead.

34:39.412 --> 34:40.830
I'm sorry.

34:47.253 --> 34:49.839
No. No!

34:50.923 --> 34:52.383
No, I'm not giving up yet.

34:56.220 --> 34:57.346
Put this on.

34:58.306 --> 34:59.682
- What?
- Put it on.

35:01.225 --> 35:02.560
Betty, this is weird.

35:09.734 --> 35:11.110
There's a hole in the pocket.

35:11.319 --> 35:12.695
Okay, now we're just
grasping at straws...

35:12.904 --> 35:14.322
Okay, no.
I don't know about you guys,

35:14.530 --> 35:15.823
but whenever I have a hole
in my jacket pocket,

35:16.032 --> 35:18.034
I always lose my chapstick
in the lining.

35:18.242 --> 35:19.577
Or my Montblanc?

35:20.161 --> 35:21.412
Hold on.

35:25.500 --> 35:26.918
What the hell?

35:28.294 --> 35:30.379
Nancy Drew strikes again.

35:55.655 --> 35:56.781
Oh, my God.

36:11.003 --> 36:12.088
Oh, my God.

36:23.850 --> 36:25.560
Betty...

36:26.644 --> 36:28.146
Betty, who are you calling?

36:30.898 --> 36:33.359
You have to get out
of that house. Listen to me...

36:37.572 --> 36:38.990
I understand.

36:39.907 --> 36:41.159
Thank you.

37:29.332 --> 37:30.541
Cheryl, what is it?

37:31.959 --> 37:33.878
You did a bad thing, Daddy.

37:35.338 --> 37:37.173
And now everyone knows.

37:49.060 --> 37:52.230
Sheriff. Your office told me
that I would find you here.

37:52.438 --> 37:54.440
You need to see this.
Both of you.

37:56.484 --> 37:57.568
<i>That night,</i>

37:57.777 --> 37:59.070
<i>Sheriff Keller and Mayor McCoy</i>

37:59.278 --> 38:01.197
<i>saw what we watched
in Archie's garage.</i>

38:03.491 --> 38:05.868
<i>Jason, tied to a chair,</i>

38:06.077 --> 38:07.370
<i>in the basement of a bar,</i>

38:07.578 --> 38:09.455
<i>on the Southside
of Riverdale,</i>

38:09.664 --> 38:12.250
<i>while a Serpent,
Mustang, taunted him.</i>

38:13.834 --> 38:15.836
<i>Then, the unthinkable.</i>

38:19.215 --> 38:20.341
Oh, my God.

38:47.159 --> 38:48.452
Oh, my God.

39:03.301 --> 39:06.429
<i>Later, we would learn why
my father confessed.</i>

39:08.139 --> 39:09.473
<i>Because Clifford Blossom</i>

39:09.682 --> 39:11.726
<i>visited him
on the night of his arrest,</i>

39:11.934 --> 39:13.185
<i>with a threat,</i>

39:14.603 --> 39:17.148
<i>that I, Jughead Jones,</i>

39:17.356 --> 39:20.026
<i>would suffer the same fate
as Jason Blossom,</i>

39:20.234 --> 39:22.111
<i>if my father didn't confess.</i>

39:22.820 --> 39:26.073
<i>My dad was protecting me
from a monster,</i>

39:26.282 --> 39:28.200
<i>and the nightmare
was far from over.</i>

39:28.409 --> 39:30.036
...charged with tampering
with evidence,

39:30.244 --> 39:32.246
obstruction of justice,
mishandling a body,

39:32.455 --> 39:34.832
perjury, and that's just
off the top of my head.

39:35.499 --> 39:37.501
He's not getting out
any time soon.

39:54.185 --> 39:55.644
I'm sorry, Mom,

39:56.937 --> 39:58.189
that I ever thought
that Dad...

39:58.397 --> 40:00.816
Shh, <i>mija.</i>

40:01.025 --> 40:03.152
Everyone makes mistakes.

40:03.778 --> 40:05.529
I have good news.

40:07.281 --> 40:08.783
Very good news.

40:09.533 --> 40:11.202
Your father's coming home.

40:14.747 --> 40:17.917
<i>And our families,
far from repaired...</i>

40:18.125 --> 40:20.002
I'm sorry, Mom,
but my friends need me.

40:20.836 --> 40:22.171
You should come
for the summer, maybe?

40:23.255 --> 40:24.382
That'd be great.

40:27.968 --> 40:30.471
- You be careful.
- I will.

40:30.679 --> 40:32.390
You better.

40:33.474 --> 40:34.809
I love you, Archie.

40:35.851 --> 40:37.186
I love you too, Mom.

40:59.792 --> 41:02.962
<i>And though
one question had been
answered that night,</i>

41:03.170 --> 41:05.798
<i>that it was Clifford Blossom
who killed Jason,</i>

41:06.006 --> 41:08.050
<i>a new mystery
loomed over Riverdale.</i>

41:08.259 --> 41:10.886
<i>Why had he done it?
It was a question</i>

41:11.095 --> 41:13.722
<i>only Clifford himself
would be able to answer.</i>
