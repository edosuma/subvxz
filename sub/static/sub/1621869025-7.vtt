[Diggins] Welcome, players,
to the elimination round.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.776
If it's true that what you
don't know can never hurt you,

00:25.776 --> 00:27.987
then what you do know
must come at a cost.

00:27.987 --> 00:30.239
Blind Man's Bluff
challenges you to face

00:30.239 --> 00:32.158
three fears at once.

00:32.158 --> 00:35.077
Fear of darkness,
fear of falling,

00:35.077 --> 00:37.121
- and fear of the unknown.

of this challenge will move on

00:46.422 --> 00:48.174

00:48.174 --> 00:50.092
The challenge tonight
is to make it off the bridge

00:50.092 --> 00:51.719
and back to the van.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.846
You can choose to walk blind

00:53.846 --> 00:56.849
or you can ask for a hand and
we get to ask you a question.

00:56.849 --> 00:58.476
What kind of questions?

00:59.518 --> 01:01.270
Quid pro quo.

You can answer up to five
questions, but you only have

01:10.738 --> 01:12.782
one chance to do it
before the timer starts.

01:12.782 --> 01:14.784
[gasps]
Oh.

01:15.868 --> 01:18.829
Points will be rewarded
based on time.

01:18.829 --> 01:20.372
Anyone who takes longer
than 20 minutes

Thank you.

02:45.791 --> 02:47.793
- Oh, Lord.
- Nothing on Hunt?

02:47.793 --> 02:50.796
No. He could be in Cleveland
for all we know.

02:50.796 --> 02:53.090
- Yeah, something spooked him.
- Okay, the last time

02:53.090 --> 02:55.092
his mom saw him,
he was heading off to the derby.

02:55.092 --> 02:57.219
Oh. Found this in his bedroom,

up this afternoon, okay?

For a memorial tree.

Oh. Well, you know what?

03:35.507 --> 03:36.967
I am sure that the library

03:36.967 --> 03:38.510
will have some
you can borrow, okay?

Okay.

But why can't we stay
at Bishop's?

03:59.239 --> 04:02.284
I already told you. Okay?

The law says that I can't take
care of you until my birthday.

in a lot of trouble.

not to say anything, okay?

You're gonna have

- Make lots of friends?
- Yeah.

if this still counts,

She was paralyzed
in an accident.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.237
But the only time
I asked him about it, he lied.

12:59.237 --> 13:01.198
He said it happened
during Hurricane Harvey.

13:01.198 --> 13:03.575
But there's a trophy
from her last big rodeo

13:03.575 --> 13:07.120
displayed in the living room
that proves

13:07.120 --> 13:09.122
she was competing
after the hurricane.

13:09.122 --> 13:12.209

anyone to know when it happened,

13:12.209 --> 13:14.044
or he doesn't want them
to know how it happened.

13:15.253 --> 13:18.173
I'm the only one
who knows about Dayna.

13:18.173 --> 13:20.091
If Dodge finds out...

13:20.091 --> 13:23.553
He won't find out.
He won't, you know?

13:23.553 --> 13:26.765
What happens at a challenge
stays at a challenge. Remember?

13:28.725 --> 13:30.143
What is it?

13:31.937 --> 13:34.064
You didn't tell the judges
something else, did you?

13:34.064 --> 13:35.607
Mm...

13:35.607 --> 13:38.235
I-I didn't. I didn't.

13:38.235 --> 13:40.320
Ray was the first one back.

13:42.948 --> 13:44.950
How do you think he did that?

13:46.409 --> 13:49.246
If he answered
all five questions.

13:49.246 --> 13:52.082
Oh, my God.

13:52.082 --> 13:54.584
Oh, my God.
What if he said something?

13:54.584 --> 13:56.795
Bishop can't find out
I hooked up with Ray.

13:56.795 --> 13:58.296
They wouldn't care
about me, though, right?

13:58.296 --> 14:01.174
Like-like, the judges
wouldn't ask about me

14:01.174 --> 14:03.468
if I'm out of the game, right?

14:03.468 --> 14:06.012
- I don't know.
- I have to go talk to Ray.

14:06.012 --> 14:08.431
It's okay.

14:08.431 --> 14:11.434
It's just not fair.

14:11.434 --> 14:13.853
You should be in the final four,
not Shawna.

14:13.853 --> 14:17.649
At least we're still
in second place.

14:17.649 --> 14:21.403
Maybe you can ask the judges
for an exception.

14:21.403 --> 14:23.822
You still have your immunity.

14:23.822 --> 14:26.157
Yeah, but you have to use it
before the challenge starts.

14:26.157 --> 14:28.285
Just talk to Diggins.

14:29.327 --> 14:31.538
We've come this far as a team.

14:32.956 --> 14:34.791
We can do this.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.376
Heather, you and me.

14:36.376 --> 14:39.045
We can win this together.

14:43.508 --> 14:45.510
Diggins, all you have to do
is ask.

14:45.510 --> 14:47.095
Heather, I'm not gonna ask
the judges

14:47.095 --> 14:48.513
when I already know
what the answer is.

14:48.513 --> 14:51.141
You have to claim immunity
between the announcement

14:51.141 --> 14:52.350
of the challenge
and the time it begins.

14:52.350 --> 14:55.145
- It's in the bylaws.
- What bylaws?

14:55.145 --> 14:57.856
Heather, all I can say
is the judges

14:57.856 --> 15:01.860
are going through
some tension right now.

15:01.860 --> 15:04.070
Some tension?
What does that mean?

15:04.070 --> 15:06.656
I'm running out of money.
I really need back in the game.

15:06.656 --> 15:10.368
Look, just try not
to think about it, okay?

15:10.368 --> 15:13.204
It's just a game.
You're room 107.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.418
Um, Heather.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.837
Wait, um,
I actually just realized

15:20.837 --> 15:23.757
that I am completely
overcharging you for this week.

15:24.883 --> 15:26.885
We got a promotion going.

15:26.885 --> 15:28.678
It's buy one, get one free.

15:29.679 --> 15:31.431
Diggins.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.266
That's all you're
gonna charge me?

15:33.266 --> 15:36.269
Just don't expect to see
those rates at high season.

15:57.999 --> 15:59.668
Well, I was wondering if maybe

15:59.668 --> 16:02.087
I could get some more hours
in the fall?

16:02.087 --> 16:04.089
You know? Just do, like,

16:04.089 --> 16:06.007
housework or laundry
or something.

16:08.009 --> 16:09.969

That really seems like
a hell of a coincidence.

37:19.529 --> 37:21.782
Yeah. Both Jimmy
and Abby's deaths

37:21.782 --> 37:23.784
are connected
to the game, but...

37:23.784 --> 37:26.119

You let me do the worrying,

Any idea what she
was doing over here?

Yeah.
