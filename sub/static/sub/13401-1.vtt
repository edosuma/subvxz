00:20.603 --> 00:23.090
<i>There's a serious disease.</i>

00:26.468 --> 00:29.510
<i>But we can't give in to hysteria or fear.</i>

00:32.752 --> 00:36.285
<i>Because that only makes it harder to get
people the accurate information they need.</i>

00:36.386 --> 00:39.728
<i>East Mission, Oregon will be the third
major outbreak in the United States.</i>

00:39.828 --> 00:42.161
<i>Large stores of the antidote drug Zombrex...</i>

00:42.261 --> 00:44.820
<i>...contained the process,
though of thousands remain trapped.</i>

00:44.920 --> 00:46.653
<i>The President has called in the military...</i>

00:46.753 --> 00:49.278
<i>...has stopped all evacuation efforts
and sealed the city.</i>

00:49.378 --> 00:53.123
<i>25,000 civilians
still trapped inside the zone...</i>

00:53.643 --> 00:57.252
<i>...the military construction of
a quarantine wall without authorization.</i>

01:00.268 --> 01:02.443
<i>...in Congress objecting strongly...</i>

01:02.543 --> 01:04.678
<i>...wall completed in record time.</i>

01:04.778 --> 01:08.920
<i>East Mission is now the most dangerous
infected zone in the world.</i>

01:09.020 --> 01:14.261
<i>Despite objections, all control of homeland
defense handed to the military.</i>

01:14.361 --> 01:19.183
We've worked very closely with Phenotrans
to improve how we treat the infected people.

01:21.595 --> 01:24.170
We will implant them with these.

01:25.220 --> 01:28.253
This chip contains highly concentrated
supply of Zombrex.

01:28.353 --> 01:32.903
<i>Chip implantation is now mandatory
for all infected Americans.</i>

01:33.603 --> 01:36.311
<i>More than one and a half million Americans
now carry the Zombrex chip.</i>

01:36.411 --> 01:38.704
<i>Fear of a new outbreak runs high.</i>

01:38.804 --> 01:41.336
<i>The Army gains the power
of arrest and detention.</i>

01:41.436 --> 01:43.228
<i>The rash of unexplained disappearances...</i>

01:43.328 --> 01:45.708
<i>Conspiracy theories are circulating
on the Internet.</i>

01:45.808 --> 01:49.378
<i>Some websites claiming that more than
300 people are now unaccounted for.</i>

01:49.478 --> 01:51.953
- Chase, do you hear me?
- <i>Journalist Chase Carter...</i>

01:52.053 --> 01:54.261
<i>Frantically searching for his producer.
Jordan Blair.</i>

01:54.361 --> 01:56.370
<i>Jordan Blair disappeared
during the outbreak.</i>

01:56.470 --> 02:00.153
<i>...vanished while reporting
on Army corruption.</i>

02:00.253 --> 02:04.728
- <i>Many believe she was the first victim...</i>
- <i>Without proof of a larger conspiracy...</i>

02:04.828 --> 02:08.919
<i>...the only resistance are those
brave enough to report.</i>

02:09.020 --> 02:10.877
- <i>Where are the missing persons?</i>
- Jordan!

02:10.978 --> 02:14.195
- <i>Where's Jordan Blair?</i>
- <i>Where's Jordan Blair?</i>

02:58.344 --> 03:00.336
- Come on!
- What?

03:00.436 --> 03:03.013
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Kid's a walking disease bag.

03:03.113 --> 03:05.666
No different from the rest
of these motherfuckers.

03:06.970 --> 03:09.986
I'm just not all that cool
about what's about to happen.

03:11.545 --> 03:14.753
You'll learn. Don't think
about it too much, all right?

03:14.853 --> 03:17.003
We're transport. Just transport.

03:17.103 --> 03:20.195
In this goddamn town,
that's trouble enough.

03:30.228 --> 03:33.270
Chase, we gotta get out of here.
There's fucking Zs everywhere, man.

03:33.370 --> 03:35.936
We're not going anywhere until
I get what you promised me.

03:36.036 --> 03:37.753
You said your guys would be here.
Where are they?

03:37.853 --> 03:41.861
- They'll be here. Trust me!
- They better be.

03:47.636 --> 03:49.811
- Shit.
- How's the feed?

03:49.911 --> 03:53.370
- You in yet?
- Yeah. Piece of cake.

03:53.470 --> 03:56.130
We hear you, Chase.
How about some picture?

04:00.195 --> 04:01.620
Gotcha.

04:02.670 --> 04:07.195
There they are. There they are. I told you
they'd be here. I told you they'd be here.

04:07.586 --> 04:10.511
- I can't see inside.
- There they are. That's part of the deal.

04:10.611 --> 04:12.495
<i>Yeah, well, we're doing
a Missing Persons piece,</i>

04:12.595 --> 04:15.978
<i>so if I can't see the goddamn hostages,
we don't have a story.</i>

04:16.870 --> 04:19.035
- Where are they taking them?
- How am I supposed to know?

04:19.135 --> 04:21.970
All I know is that they don't come back.

04:22.803 --> 04:25.053
Here's your money.

04:25.478 --> 04:28.011
You can't leave me here alone.

04:31.861 --> 04:33.686
You'll be fine.

04:34.386 --> 04:37.795
- I'm going in.
- Wait, what?

04:40.720 --> 04:43.261
Chase, don't go in there.

04:50.036 --> 04:54.370
- I gotta get the exchange on camera.
- Goddammit, does he listen to anyone?

04:54.470 --> 04:57.953
- You're dating him.
- Not this week.

05:06.561 --> 05:07.953
Shit.

05:33.070 --> 05:34.970
Look who it is.

05:35.070 --> 05:38.620
Tell me you're getting this.
General Alan fucking Lyons.

05:38.720 --> 05:40.970
<i>General.</i>

05:42.720 --> 05:44.903
<i>To what do we owe the honor?</i>

05:45.003 --> 05:48.870
<i>How are things going for you, Skinner?
Getting everything you need?</i>

05:48.970 --> 05:51.466
- <i>We're fine.</i>
- <i>You know what I need?</i>

05:51.566 --> 05:55.336
- Who are the prisoners?
- I want my covert ops to remain covert.

05:55.436 --> 05:58.828
You exist to provide a pipeline
for Leo Rand.

05:58.928 --> 06:02.086
An invisible pipeline.
When you become visible,

06:02.286 --> 06:05.778
- your reasons for existing end.
- Chase, what the hell are we looking at?

06:05.878 --> 06:10.470
- <i>You really think I'm that stupid?</i>
- <i>Well, that's the reason for the visit.</i>

06:10.570 --> 06:14.503
To make sure you understand
the importance of not being stupid.

06:14.603 --> 06:17.595
- I don't know yet.
- <i>Would I ever let you down?</i>

06:17.695 --> 06:22.620
<i>You know, I don't mind that your
product pays for our operations.</i>

06:22.761 --> 06:25.170
I've seen worse.

06:25.370 --> 06:30.086
General Lyons is allegedly supposed
to be in Washington DC all week.

06:30.261 --> 06:35.036
- You hacked his personal schedule?
- Want to know what he had for breakfast?

06:35.436 --> 06:38.845
My people also tell me that you have
a problem moving more bodies.

06:38.945 --> 06:41.728
That deal was supposed to end weeks ago.

06:41.828 --> 06:45.003
<i>None of us have been thrilled
about moving your prisoners.</i>

06:46.553 --> 06:50.736
Afterlife is close now. This may be
the last group you move through the zone.

06:51.136 --> 06:53.578
What the hell is going on here?

06:54.345 --> 06:56.353
All right.

06:59.011 --> 07:01.286
What happens
to our little agreement once...

07:01.386 --> 07:03.870
Let me go! Let me go!

07:04.386 --> 07:08.390
Found this one outside.
He got this with him.

07:08.490 --> 07:11.620
- <i>One of yours?</i>
- Fuck me!

07:11.720 --> 07:15.053
- Anybody else out there?
- Nah, he's by himself.

07:15.153 --> 07:18.045
Hey! Have you talked to anyone?

07:18.145 --> 07:22.128
No, no, I swear, I did not.
Look, I just came back to work. Okay?

07:22.228 --> 07:26.036
I needed the money. I just wanted
the work. I just wanted the work.

07:26.136 --> 07:28.845
He's seen this. He's seen me.

07:29.453 --> 07:31.035
Hey!

07:31.135 --> 07:33.428
No guns.

07:36.703 --> 07:39.924
Hey, you're all right.

07:41.303 --> 07:43.845
You're one of us.

07:54.386 --> 07:55.761
Oh, fuck.

07:55.861 --> 08:00.615
Chase! Chase, get out of there.
Get out of there now.

08:01.711 --> 08:04.082
Hey, Skinner.
Skinner, there's someone up there.

08:04.311 --> 08:06.047
- Handle it.
- I got it.

08:06.147 --> 08:08.711
Chase, get to the pickup.

08:20.236 --> 08:21.923
Shit!

08:34.303 --> 08:36.720
Take note of all present, Captain.

08:36.820 --> 08:39.745
Once Afterlife is executed...

08:39.845 --> 08:42.211
this pipeline needs to be sanitized.

08:42.311 --> 08:44.378
Yes, sir.

09:00.370 --> 09:02.228
Fuck.

09:08.320 --> 09:10.495
Oh, my God.

09:10.595 --> 09:12.133
Shit.

09:20.536 --> 09:22.693
Do you see him?

09:29.695 --> 09:31.513
What?

09:39.603 --> 09:41.486
Nothing.

09:42.136 --> 09:44.353
Let's try over here.

10:05.011 --> 10:07.828
He's on the street! Let's go!

10:38.136 --> 10:40.594
You gotta be kidding me.

10:41.753 --> 10:43.086
Shit.

11:04.978 --> 11:06.820
Shit.

11:52.503 --> 11:54.920
I'm getting too old for this shit.

12:03.075 --> 12:05.435
Oh, my God.

12:05.650 --> 12:08.375
Don't do that to me, okay?

12:08.475 --> 12:10.817
Don't do that to me.

12:10.999 --> 12:14.483
Don't you ever do that to me again!

12:14.583 --> 12:16.758
You scared the shit out of me!

12:16.858 --> 12:18.561
Now get in the car!

12:21.325 --> 12:24.967
- Let's go!
- Drive. Go, go, go!

12:35.325 --> 12:38.892
- We can't run this.
- You mean, you're too afraid to run it?

12:38.992 --> 12:42.391
- The lawsuit here would bury this network.
- Now the lawyers tell us what's the news?

12:42.491 --> 12:46.767
Everything runs through my office.
Don't waste your time unless this is air-tight.

12:46.867 --> 12:50.525
You screw this up
and the Army will own our ass.

12:53.934 --> 12:55.692
You pussy.

12:55.792 --> 13:00.125
Thank you. We got Lyons involved
in a possible human trafficking ring,

13:00.225 --> 13:03.192
and complicit in a murder execution.
What more do you need?

13:03.292 --> 13:07.000
Forget the lawyers for a second. You want
to accuse a two-star general of murder

13:07.100 --> 13:12.125
and go toe-to-toe with the US military
over some dark footage and crappy audio?

13:12.225 --> 13:14.917
Do you want to be the next person
who disappears?

13:15.017 --> 13:16.168
I'll take my chances.

13:16.268 --> 13:20.675
Yeah, I'm not going to put this program
and my A-team in the military cross hairs.

13:20.775 --> 13:24.209
It's my job to protect my reporters,
even from themselves.

13:24.309 --> 13:26.634
So we what? We sit on this?

13:26.784 --> 13:31.100
We do another propaganda puff piece
on Phenotrans humanitarian efforts?

13:31.200 --> 13:35.025
People's lives and reputations are on the
line and you don't even have a story yet.

13:35.125 --> 13:38.659
Who are those prisoners? Who the hell
is Leo Rand? What the fuck is Afterlife?

13:38.759 --> 13:42.225
They're abducting people.
And they killed someone!

13:42.325 --> 13:44.542
My source. Our source.

13:44.642 --> 13:48.509
But apparently, I'm the only one in this room
with the balls to do something about it.

13:48.609 --> 13:50.950
No offense, Jill.

13:51.517 --> 13:54.009
You're outta control, Chase.

13:54.109 --> 13:56.259
You're a journalist or a vigilante?

13:56.359 --> 14:00.034
Because you seem more interested
in chasing ghosts than facts.

14:00.134 --> 14:02.134
Or have you forgotten what happened
to your last partner?

14:02.234 --> 14:03.759
Hey! Don't even go there!

14:03.859 --> 14:07.475
Jordan Blair is gone, Chase,
and she's never coming back.

14:11.525 --> 14:13.911
You don't know that.

14:15.692 --> 14:18.175
You don't know that!

14:29.567 --> 14:31.425
Chase.

14:32.150 --> 14:34.009
Chase!

14:34.109 --> 14:36.009
You know, I could've used
a little support back there.

14:36.109 --> 14:39.675
Don't give me that shit. You know
I support you more than anyone else.

14:39.775 --> 14:43.917
Look, are we a team or am I just
along for the ride? Because...

14:44.017 --> 14:48.805
this one-man crusade is really starting
to look like a suicide mission.

14:50.392 --> 14:52.159
You know I'm invested in this.

14:52.259 --> 14:56.034
You know I would love nothing more than
to watch these guys burn to the ground,

14:56.134 --> 14:59.019
but I won't watch you get yourself killed.

14:59.634 --> 15:03.142
And if that's what you're going to do,
then you have to do it on your own.

15:10.709 --> 15:13.767
- Beer?
- Yeah.

15:19.309 --> 15:21.725
Collins was right.

15:21.825 --> 15:24.092
I was so hell bent on getting a story,

15:24.192 --> 15:27.300
I didn't see how my actions
could hurt other people.

15:27.400 --> 15:29.792
Sandra will get over it.

15:30.859 --> 15:33.217
Not Sandra.

15:33.317 --> 15:35.150
Jordan.

15:35.650 --> 15:39.960
She told me not to go into that tent,
and I did it anyway.

15:40.060 --> 15:43.884
- I left her.
- Chase, it's not your fault.

15:43.984 --> 15:46.925
We know that Phenotrans is responsible
for the East Mission outbreak.

15:47.025 --> 15:50.550
- That the US Army covered it up.
- But I failed.

15:50.650 --> 15:55.117
Lyons was never held accountable.
And Phenotrans has only grown stronger.

15:55.217 --> 15:59.075
I mean, this is like,
Iran-Contra all over again.

15:59.175 --> 16:03.275
The US military is using drug dealers
to do their dirty work.

16:03.375 --> 16:05.925
- And people are disappearing.
- Yes.

16:06.025 --> 16:08.267
This is the reason
why I got into Journalism.

16:08.367 --> 16:11.017
To break stories like this.

16:11.909 --> 16:14.425
You said it yourself
we need to go back in.

16:14.525 --> 16:16.867
You're the only one crazy enough to do it.

16:16.967 --> 16:19.342
So when you're done being a little girl...

16:19.442 --> 16:21.800
you let me know.

16:34.734 --> 16:38.384
Hey, I don't have
a lot of time to explain,

16:38.484 --> 16:41.050
you're in a lot of danger right now.

16:41.150 --> 16:45.375
- You should come with me.
- Yeah, I'm going home, buddy.

16:46.109 --> 16:48.925
I know who you are. You're Chase Carter.

16:49.025 --> 16:52.918
I know what you saw. Afterlife.

16:53.484 --> 16:55.592
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm George Hancock.

16:55.692 --> 16:59.967
As of a couple hours ago,
I was a senior exec at Phenotrans.

17:01.984 --> 17:04.425
Come and take a look.

17:10.017 --> 17:13.659
- Fuck me.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come with me.

17:13.759 --> 17:16.284
This way. This way.

17:16.483 --> 17:19.892
- All right, you're with me.
- Chase Carter!

17:22.400 --> 17:26.775
Jesus! No, no! Come on, this way!
This way! Up here! Up here!

17:26.875 --> 17:29.659
- Come on. Come on.
- Cover the back!

17:29.759 --> 17:31.931
Cover the back!

17:42.684 --> 17:44.502
Shit!

17:55.717 --> 17:57.704
Come on!

18:10.375 --> 18:13.092
Come on. This way.

18:13.492 --> 18:14.850
What the fuck's Afterlife?

18:14.950 --> 18:17.734
It's their logical conclusion
of Project Watchtower.

18:17.834 --> 18:21.867
Phenotrans developed it.
Military controls it.

18:21.967 --> 18:24.759
And you've seen too much already.

18:32.675 --> 18:34.210
Carter!

18:52.609 --> 18:53.990
Fuck!

18:55.942 --> 18:58.625
Hurry up! Come on!

19:00.317 --> 19:03.750
Get in the back! Get in the back!

19:09.009 --> 19:11.314
Son of a bitch!

19:15.609 --> 19:17.792
- <i>Captain?</i>
- We missed him, sir.

19:18.650 --> 19:22.109
- <i>It looks like someone warned him.</i>
- Find out who.

19:22.209 --> 19:23.942
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

19:24.042 --> 19:27.057
Extreme prejudice, Captain. Understood?

19:27.267 --> 19:28.992
Of course.

19:32.775 --> 19:34.619
Thanks.

19:35.300 --> 19:38.767
- How'd they know where to find me?
- They know everything, man.

19:38.867 --> 19:41.592
Phenotrans got a hold of that footage
you sent to the network,

19:41.692 --> 19:45.209
- it caused quite a panic.
- What's Phenotrans' involvement?

19:45.309 --> 19:49.775
They're secretly funneling drugs to
the outside in exchange for test subjects.

19:49.875 --> 19:52.925
Like test subjects?
You mean people who are infected?

19:53.025 --> 19:57.262
No, not necessarily. They need to know that
Afterlife works under real life conditions.

19:57.362 --> 20:00.092
So the Army,
they just seize whoever they want.

20:00.192 --> 20:03.114
Claim they turned Z,
who's gonna argue with that?

20:03.484 --> 20:07.675
Everyone who's infected has a chip, right?
It carries one to three years of Zombrex.

20:07.775 --> 20:11.809
Released daily it prevents the user from
becoming a zombie. Released all at once...

20:11.909 --> 20:13.392
- Overdose.
- Exactly right.

20:13.492 --> 20:18.242
- So Phenotrans can kill anyone with a chip?
- We designed it. As a failsafe.

20:18.775 --> 20:22.986
If you had a problem, you could prevent
an outbreak just with the push of a button.

20:23.275 --> 20:27.925
- Genocide. Mass murder.
- That was the Army, that wasn't us.

20:28.025 --> 20:30.842
Once they had the tech,
they wanted to use it.

20:30.942 --> 20:33.696
Kill the host... Kill all the hosts,
the virus dies along with it.

20:33.796 --> 20:35.859
No more virus, no more zombies.

20:35.959 --> 20:39.425
The greatest existential threat
in human history

20:39.525 --> 20:44.009
vanishes with the flip of a switch.
That's Afterlife.

20:44.109 --> 20:47.809
We're talking about roughly
one and a half million people.

20:47.909 --> 20:50.967
- So when's this supposed to happen?
- The clock's ticking.

20:51.067 --> 20:55.417
Chip activation is set
for 7:00 pm tomorrow. Now listen...

20:55.517 --> 20:57.959
Afterlife is essentially a software.

20:58.109 --> 21:02.450
It's controlled from a secret base
inside East Mission City.

21:02.550 --> 21:05.709
I need to get there
and shut those servers down.

21:06.909 --> 21:08.167
Why'd you come to me?

21:08.267 --> 21:11.484
I hear you've been going
inside the wall for months.

21:11.584 --> 21:17.171
You... are the only person outside
the Army who can get me in there.

21:18.309 --> 21:20.334
Jesus.

21:25.859 --> 21:28.709
Sandra, don't talk, just listen.

21:28.809 --> 21:31.917
You need to get out of your house.
Get Jill and meet me at G's.

21:32.017 --> 21:35.792
You know where it is.
And don't say anything to anyone.

21:35.892 --> 21:37.975
Who the hell is Chase Carter?

21:39.334 --> 21:42.367
- He's a reporter. Why?
- You think you're the only one with spies?

21:42.467 --> 21:44.984
- He knows about Afterlife.
- How do you know this?

21:45.084 --> 21:50.175
I run a trillion dollar company. If a story
could harm Phenotrans, I hear about it.

21:50.734 --> 21:53.759
Absolute secrecy was one
of the conditions of our involvement.

21:53.859 --> 21:56.434
I'm shutting the project down.

21:57.109 --> 22:00.325
No. We launched already.

22:00.425 --> 22:03.162
That was a huge mistake.

22:03.262 --> 22:07.150
No, building Afterlife and not using it,
that would be the mistake.

22:07.250 --> 22:10.925
If only a small portion of the carriers
read some conspiracy theory

22:11.025 --> 22:13.652
and removed their chips,
the program fails.

22:13.752 --> 22:15.997
I won't allow it.

22:20.275 --> 22:21.928
Well...

22:22.028 --> 22:25.384
a trillion dollars buys a lot of things.

22:25.484 --> 22:29.309
But the power to give me orders
is not one of them.

22:30.117 --> 22:33.125
Chase Carter has forced our hand.

22:38.050 --> 22:40.367
Take 'em. Take 'em.

22:40.984 --> 22:43.467
Get your fight out!

23:06.300 --> 23:08.134
Jesus.

23:08.234 --> 23:13.279
I need a favor, but it's dangerous,
and the Army is all over our ass.

23:14.717 --> 23:16.992
Sounds like fun.

23:17.092 --> 23:19.117
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

23:21.525 --> 23:23.384
Ladies.

23:26.817 --> 23:28.875
Who's this shady looking dude?

23:28.975 --> 23:30.850
He's cool.

23:30.950 --> 23:35.684
- George Hancock.
- Doesn't help. Get in here, man.

23:40.330 --> 23:43.030
I just ran a background check on him.
He is who he says he is.

23:43.130 --> 23:45.547
This guy has been ex-Phenotrans
for what? Five minutes?

23:45.647 --> 23:47.363
How are we supposed to trust him?

23:47.463 --> 23:51.580
Look, if what he says is true,
we need him.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.322
You don't have to like me, man.

23:53.422 --> 23:57.788
But are you willing to stand by and let
a million and a half people get murdered?

23:59.555 --> 24:01.392
How about you?

24:02.747 --> 24:05.538
How are you going to feel
if someone you love is chipped?

24:05.638 --> 24:09.163
I am chipped, so... you'll forgive me
if I'm reluctant to hop into bed

24:09.263 --> 24:11.663
with one of the assholes that made them.

24:11.763 --> 24:15.397
- You know they're tracking that.
- I made a few modifications.

24:15.497 --> 24:18.780
They're not seeing me.
But thanks for the warning.

24:22.830 --> 24:24.997
- How long?
- 24 hours.

24:25.097 --> 24:29.680
That started 11 hours ago when you pulled
that little stunt at the warehouse.

24:30.180 --> 24:32.638
I don't like this, Chase.

24:33.988 --> 24:36.330
But I like you.

24:37.288 --> 24:40.330
Screw it. This guy stinks.

24:40.430 --> 24:43.536
Friends don't let friends
go through Z town alone.

24:50.697 --> 24:52.897
That's what I'm talking about.

24:52.997 --> 24:57.347
- Besides, I still owe you for that thing.
- Not after this.

25:03.697 --> 25:06.213
What choice do we have?

25:12.980 --> 25:15.418
What's the plan?

25:17.638 --> 25:19.172
Straight from the source.

25:19.272 --> 25:22.497
This is our access point.
It's the safest route I know.

25:22.597 --> 25:24.680
We need to stay underground
as long as possible,

25:24.780 --> 25:28.938
- and get across the city as fast as we can.
- The server farm is located right here.

25:29.038 --> 25:31.563
It's an old VA hospital right
in the middle of the quarantine zone

25:31.663 --> 25:35.447
nine miles from the wall surrounded
by 15,000 infected.

25:35.547 --> 25:39.188
If we get across the city, we're going
to access the building through Ward C.

25:39.288 --> 25:42.555
I've got the pass code which will get us
in through the emergency exit.

25:42.655 --> 25:46.263
Then we're going to head up to the fourth
floor where the server farm is located.

25:46.363 --> 25:50.880
You gotta understand now that Afterlife
needs 24 hours to sync all of the chips,

25:50.980 --> 25:54.430
so it can administer the overdose
to every carrier all at once.

25:54.530 --> 25:56.263
That's our window.

25:56.363 --> 26:00.472
Once we're inside, we need to take care
of the tech to monitor the system.

26:00.572 --> 26:04.105
There's two doctors and 11 guards to provide
security to the whole building.

26:04.205 --> 26:06.555
So we'll need to find
a way around them, too.

26:06.655 --> 26:09.980
They get people thinking that the wall
was built to keep the zombies contained,

26:10.080 --> 26:14.330
but I know the wall was built
to protect the server farm.

26:14.430 --> 26:17.455
Once we're done, we'll have Chuck
extract us with his chopper.

26:17.555 --> 26:20.655
His daughter has a chip.
He'll want to help.

26:20.755 --> 26:22.930
So, what do we do when
we get there? Just blow it up?

26:23.030 --> 26:26.847
No, no, no, no. You destroy those servers,
Afterlife is triggered immediately.

26:26.947 --> 26:29.897
We need to get in there and shut
the servers down, freeze 'em up.

26:29.997 --> 26:33.147
So we freeze 'em with some
sort of virus or malware.

26:33.247 --> 26:36.505
Yeah. You think you can swing it?

26:37.313 --> 26:40.472
As soon as I understand
the system's architecture, yeah.

26:40.572 --> 26:42.788
I should be able to handle it.

26:42.888 --> 26:46.380
Here you go. Straight from the source.

26:48.747 --> 26:51.105
I had a bad feeling about this
right from the get-go.

26:51.205 --> 26:54.988
I thought I'd snatch that up
and keep it for myself.

26:55.905 --> 26:58.847
13 hours. We better get going.

27:01.622 --> 27:04.080
I think I can do this.

27:05.488 --> 27:07.572
I'll call you back.

27:16.972 --> 27:19.713
Carter's source is George Hancock.

27:19.813 --> 27:22.513
- He works for you.
- George Hancock?

27:22.613 --> 27:25.347
Check his home and office right now.

27:25.447 --> 27:27.913
Destroy him or discredit him immediately.

27:28.013 --> 27:32.055
Call off Afterlife. You can't pull
the trigger with Hancock on the loose.

27:32.155 --> 27:36.105
We're talking about the survival of
the human race. If push comes to shove,

27:36.205 --> 27:39.513
I will stand before the American people
and explain why it was necessary.

27:39.613 --> 27:42.113
Hancock knows we created
the first outbreak.

27:42.213 --> 27:45.730
Are you prepared to tell the American
people you destroyed an entire city,

27:45.830 --> 27:49.463
so you could take control
of Homeland Security? Call it off.

27:49.563 --> 27:53.297
Put your dog on a leash
and then we'll talk options.

27:53.397 --> 27:56.405
And show some goddamn respect.

28:00.805 --> 28:03.697
Where the hell is George Hancock?

28:05.863 --> 28:08.147
Hey, Jill.

28:09.347 --> 28:12.538
- I need someone on the outside.
- Bullshit, I'm coming with you.

28:12.638 --> 28:15.488
Aside from everything else,
this is a huge story.

28:15.588 --> 28:18.497
Somebody needs to make sure it gets out.

28:18.597 --> 28:20.063
No matter what happens...

28:20.163 --> 28:22.397
- Don't talk like that.
- We gotta go.

28:22.497 --> 28:26.055
Call Chuck. Make sure
he's standing by with his chopper.

28:29.138 --> 28:31.613
And watch your back.

28:35.422 --> 28:39.247
You might have to hold the handle down
a couple of seconds for it to flush.

28:54.972 --> 28:59.080
Hey, just so you know,
my daughter's chipped.

28:59.180 --> 29:01.655
How'd you get yours?

29:02.138 --> 29:05.129
Fortune City. Second outbreak.

29:05.609 --> 29:08.597
I was in Army Intelligence
with a quick response unit.

29:08.697 --> 29:13.180
There to hack websites, block reports,
jam the media the brass didn't like.

29:13.280 --> 29:14.997
Desk job, right?

29:15.097 --> 29:18.280
Zombie outbreak isn't the kind
of party you want to arrive at early.

29:18.380 --> 29:22.538
Anyway, the Army ran me out.
So I went freelance.

29:22.638 --> 29:25.230
Until Chase found me.

29:25.930 --> 29:29.622
He was the first guy in years
that didn't treat me like a leper.

29:29.722 --> 29:32.280
Made me go legit.

29:32.505 --> 29:34.355
Bastard.

29:38.030 --> 29:41.397
- How's our connection?
- We're good.

30:13.322 --> 30:15.622
You sure your girl's up for this?

30:15.722 --> 30:19.738
She's good to go.
You sure you can get us in that hospital?

30:20.538 --> 30:23.605
I have the access code
to the emergency exit. We're good.

30:23.705 --> 30:26.063
Well, okay then.

30:33.097 --> 30:37.672
Security access.
Connects the old and new systems.

30:41.680 --> 30:45.638
Through here, we're on the inside.

30:58.313 --> 31:00.330
Come on.

31:02.538 --> 31:05.013
Stay close to Garth.

31:12.055 --> 31:14.288
Here we go.

31:37.497 --> 31:40.438
How far until we reach anything hostile?

31:40.538 --> 31:43.722
A mile, hundred yards.

31:43.830 --> 31:46.288
Behind that corner.

32:35.270 --> 32:37.061
Go!

32:40.919 --> 32:42.810
Clear.

32:50.085 --> 32:52.735
Find out what's on his laptops.

33:03.694 --> 33:09.360
- Tell me you have Chase Carter in custody.
- <i>I'm afraid not. We'll sweep for intel.</i>

33:09.460 --> 33:12.677
I'd like to expand our ask
to the rest of his team.

33:12.777 --> 33:16.319
- <i>I don't think we have a choice.</i>
- Thank you, sir.

33:17.694 --> 33:20.135
Central, this is Smith,
I'd like to add two new targets.

33:20.235 --> 33:22.177
Garth O'Toole and Jill Eikland.

33:22.277 --> 33:25.294
They're both newly infected
and are under high risk to turn.

33:25.394 --> 33:29.260
They don't have chips
or access to Zombrex.

33:29.360 --> 33:32.294
Lethal force is authorized.

34:03.069 --> 34:05.052
Shit.

34:05.152 --> 34:07.310
This guy wasn't here yesterday.

34:08.277 --> 34:12.768
- Who would do that?
- Survivors, gang members.

34:12.869 --> 34:15.161
Who knows?

34:19.960 --> 34:21.635
Stepping through.

34:21.735 --> 34:24.302
- Chase?
- Yeah?

34:24.402 --> 34:26.635
Maybe I should take point.

34:26.735 --> 34:28.985
Be my guest.

34:45.819 --> 34:48.627
- Wait.
- What is it?

34:57.694 --> 35:01.594
- We need another route.
- Do you know another route?

35:01.694 --> 35:04.769
Not as well as I know this one.

35:04.869 --> 35:07.445
Let's go, Garth, come on.

35:12.944 --> 35:15.710
Sandy, watch our six.

35:18.819 --> 35:21.077
Stay tight.

35:36.444 --> 35:39.260
I've never seen the network respond
like this. They're scared shitless.

35:39.360 --> 35:42.177
- Will they support us?
- Well, the Army listed you as infected.

35:42.277 --> 35:45.244
There are arrest warrants out.
They're freezing your bank accounts.

35:45.354 --> 35:50.094
And our lawyers are terrified, they're going
to be moving from you guys to the network.

35:50.194 --> 35:54.302
This is how they get rid of people.
I need you to do something for me.

35:54.402 --> 35:58.427
I'm going to draw their attention.
I want them fixated on me, not Chase.

35:58.527 --> 36:01.927
When they come and check whatever story
I tell them, I need you to have my back.

36:02.027 --> 36:05.352
You're drawing this to you?
That's suicide.

36:05.452 --> 36:09.160
You said you have to look out
for your reporters. This is how.

36:09.260 --> 36:12.950
- The network is not going to go for...
- Not the network! You!

36:13.050 --> 36:16.910
I need your help. We need your help.

36:18.194 --> 36:22.469
They're coming for us,
and we can either lay it down or fight back.

36:45.860 --> 36:48.659
Do you have any idea where we're going?

36:48.759 --> 36:50.877
Approximately.

36:55.127 --> 36:57.485
Hey, you smell that?

36:57.585 --> 37:00.052
Yeah, it smells like rotting corpse.

37:00.152 --> 37:02.610
No, it's something else.

37:08.319 --> 37:10.802
Freeze. Put the guns down.

37:10.902 --> 37:14.327
Now! Get your fingers off.

37:14.427 --> 37:16.044
- Drop it!
- Drop it!

37:16.144 --> 37:18.168
Put it down!

37:19.902 --> 37:22.919
Let's go. Let's go.

37:23.394 --> 37:25.452
Drop it!

37:27.068 --> 37:31.519
- What? Something you want to say?
- Take it easy, all right? We're not a threat.

37:31.619 --> 37:35.727
- We're just passing through.
- Not yet, you're not.

37:35.827 --> 37:39.552
- You need to know the password.
- I got you your password right here.

37:39.652 --> 37:42.055
Right between my legs.

37:42.555 --> 37:44.074
That's nice.

37:45.510 --> 37:49.027
- You like that?
- There's a new one?

37:50.802 --> 37:53.069
- Talking piñata.
- Come here.

37:53.169 --> 37:56.460
- I'll fucking...
- You might want to let go!

37:57.019 --> 37:59.260
- All right.
- Good.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.477
All right, question the foul mouth.

38:01.577 --> 38:04.869
If he doesn't talk,
leave his body by the junction.

38:04.969 --> 38:08.952
Keep Zs distracted for a bit,
let's move 'em inside.

38:09.927 --> 38:13.452
Let's find out who these assholes are.

38:13.552 --> 38:15.427
Move.

38:15.527 --> 38:16.927
Hey, guys, help me down, guys.

38:17.027 --> 38:18.652
- Let's go.
- All right.

38:18.752 --> 38:21.015
Move your ass.

38:21.252 --> 38:25.060
I'll bite your dick off, you motherfucker.
You better hope I never see you again...

38:25.160 --> 38:27.485
Zs coming.

38:30.344 --> 38:32.760
Can we talk about this?

38:33.110 --> 38:35.327
- Yeah, let's talk.
- Good.

38:53.994 --> 38:56.444
Get your ass over there.

39:01.485 --> 39:03.774
Who are you?

39:07.235 --> 39:09.721
We work for Lyons.

39:10.402 --> 39:12.535
Bullshit.

39:14.385 --> 39:17.410
You want to piss him off
twice in one week?

39:17.510 --> 39:20.485
And what do you know about that?

39:20.777 --> 39:22.702
Only what he told me.

39:24.402 --> 39:27.960
There are a lot of ways
a man can die in this city.

39:28.060 --> 39:30.296
Z would lick your bones clean

39:30.396 --> 39:34.389
before anyone even thought to look for you.

39:35.252 --> 39:37.685
That'd be a mistake.

39:37.952 --> 39:40.260
Heard you don't like running prisoners.

39:40.360 --> 39:42.885
Let us go, you won't have to.

39:42.985 --> 39:46.952
No more Rand. No more deliveries.

39:47.052 --> 39:50.969
- You're taking out the doc?
- That's right.

39:51.669 --> 39:53.402
No.

39:54.002 --> 39:56.610
No, I don't think so.

39:58.035 --> 40:03.694
No, Rand does the sickest,
most twisted shit you seen for years,

40:03.794 --> 40:06.410
and nobody says a thing.

40:06.510 --> 40:10.819
He's protected even from the military.

40:15.835 --> 40:18.310
Who are you, really?

40:18.860 --> 40:21.677
- I told you.
- Shut up.

40:22.110 --> 40:24.619
I'm talking to her.

40:25.319 --> 40:29.094
- Where are you going, darling?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

40:31.360 --> 40:33.602
Leave her alone.

40:33.702 --> 40:36.244
Now if he talks again...

40:36.644 --> 40:38.852
shoot him.

40:38.952 --> 40:41.119
Who the fuck are you?

40:41.238 --> 40:43.960
- I could do this all day.
- I'll be honest with you.

40:44.060 --> 40:46.102
Ladyboys in Bangkok
drove me harder than that.

40:46.202 --> 40:48.150
Yeah? Was it something like this?

40:50.960 --> 40:56.144
Nice. Very, very nice.

40:57.760 --> 41:00.310
Get your fucking hands off me.

41:02.152 --> 41:06.294
We're just going to go someplace
a little private.

41:06.394 --> 41:08.760
I'm going to see
what it takes to make her cry.

41:08.860 --> 41:10.754
No!

41:12.827 --> 41:15.519
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

41:16.344 --> 41:19.119
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

42:03.777 --> 42:06.152
What, did you guys start without me?

42:25.510 --> 42:28.454
Chase, we gotta boogie.
Move, move. Go, go, go!

42:28.554 --> 42:31.302
- Let's go!
- Move it! Move it!

42:31.994 --> 42:34.981
Go, go, go, go! Move, move!

42:43.210 --> 42:45.060
Sandra!

42:45.360 --> 42:47.594
Our gear!

42:47.694 --> 42:51.469
- All of our gear!
- Did they get the flash drive?

42:51.569 --> 42:55.652
- It's in my pocket.
- Come on. We gotta get out of here.

43:12.809 --> 43:15.751
We gotta move! Come on!

43:32.676 --> 43:35.029
They're stopping.

43:37.018 --> 43:39.076
What the hell is that?

43:39.976 --> 43:41.793
Run!

43:49.926 --> 43:51.809
Garth!

43:52.109 --> 43:53.724
Chase!

43:56.801 --> 43:59.000
Hancock!

44:08.393 --> 44:10.730
Attaboy, Chase.

44:13.209 --> 44:14.626
- Chase!
- Come on, we gotta get out.

44:14.726 --> 44:16.493
Come on, we gotta go now!
Come on, come on!

44:16.593 --> 44:19.352
Go, go, go, go!

44:23.951 --> 44:26.466
Go, go, go!

44:26.566 --> 44:28.118
Shit.

44:32.993 --> 44:35.686
- This way!
- Where? Where?

44:36.434 --> 44:38.718
Shit, it's locked.

44:43.843 --> 44:45.273
Shit.

44:47.143 --> 44:50.168
- Throw me the wrench.
- Get that door open!

44:50.268 --> 44:52.176
Hurry!

44:55.976 --> 44:58.934
- Go, go!
- Got it!

45:14.159 --> 45:16.834
What the hell were those things?

45:16.934 --> 45:21.709
I don't know. But they're going
to be a bitch to deal with.

45:22.151 --> 45:25.126
Since when do Zs move that fast?

45:26.551 --> 45:29.909
Hey, Garth. Garth, man.

45:30.309 --> 45:32.043
Are you still okay?

45:32.643 --> 45:35.434
Guys, what do you mean by okay?

45:36.209 --> 45:39.647
I'll live, baby. I'll live.

45:45.976 --> 45:49.384
Garth, shit. You're bit.

45:49.984 --> 45:52.576
Let's get you some Zombrex.

45:58.859 --> 46:00.676
Shit.

46:01.059 --> 46:03.409
I always knew this day would come.

46:08.393 --> 46:10.876
Let me take a look.

46:11.184 --> 46:14.276
- You gotta put pressure on it.
- Okay.

46:16.726 --> 46:19.509
It's... it's like
the goddamn things evolved.

46:19.609 --> 46:22.459
It had a tattoo on its neck.

46:22.559 --> 46:27.076
Like an ID number. That's not evolution.

46:27.376 --> 46:30.151
There's only one logical explanation.

46:31.143 --> 46:33.601
Phenotrans?

46:35.393 --> 46:37.776
I knew nothing about that.

46:37.876 --> 46:41.151
You think I would've come down here
if I knew they were there?

46:41.601 --> 46:46.359
You're the expert. Now we're stuck
down here with none of our gear.

46:46.459 --> 46:48.985
- That was your route. That's on you.
- You're blaming this one me?

46:49.085 --> 46:51.751
- That was your route.
- You would be dead if it wasn't for him.

46:51.851 --> 46:54.401
I just killed a guy out there, so did you.

46:54.501 --> 46:57.909
Those are people, not zombies.
That was never a part of the plan.

46:58.009 --> 47:01.843
So you'd rather have clean hands and no head?
Does that make you feel better?

47:01.943 --> 47:04.776
No, it wouldn't make me feel better.
It's not what I'm saying.

47:04.876 --> 47:07.684
Hey, stop! Stop!

47:09.084 --> 47:13.526
First time around I didn't have
any gear either. But I survived.

47:14.643 --> 47:18.709
We need to remember the reason
we're down here. 1.5 million lives.

47:18.809 --> 47:22.334
And we're running out of time.
We gotta stick together.

47:22.434 --> 47:24.268
Right.

47:26.493 --> 47:29.626
- I'm sorry, guys.
- You're right.

47:29.726 --> 47:31.984
It's all right.

47:37.601 --> 47:39.408
We need to build some weapons.

48:16.434 --> 48:18.459
Miss Ingot?

48:18.559 --> 48:22.918
I'm Jill Eikland from UBN. We're running
a story on Afterlife within the next 24...

48:23.018 --> 48:27.576
George Hancock suffers from severe psychiatric
problems including paranoid delusions.

48:27.676 --> 48:33.501
He's on medical leave. If you exploit him
for ratings, our lawyers will bury you.

48:33.601 --> 48:35.918
There are two versions of the story.

48:36.018 --> 48:39.609
And one, the Army took your technology
and used it to massacre a million people.

48:39.709 --> 48:43.168
And the other, Phenotrans built
Afterlife from the ground up.

48:43.668 --> 48:45.825
Which do you think I should go with?

48:45.925 --> 48:50.351
When Lyons comes for you,
you're going to need friends.

49:10.143 --> 49:11.976
Hey.

49:12.226 --> 49:14.551
We'll get there.

49:15.184 --> 49:17.668
When we do, what if I can't freeze it?

49:17.768 --> 49:20.917
- You're the best hacker I know.
- I'm the only hacker you know.

49:21.017 --> 49:23.376
Okay, you'll improvise.

49:23.476 --> 49:27.884
Look, I know you. You walk around
with a chip, act like it's nothing.

49:28.026 --> 49:30.768
You're stronger than anyone I know.

49:33.943 --> 49:36.418
I hate that I dragged you into this.

49:36.818 --> 49:41.459
Chase, you didn't drag me anywhere.
I came here on my own.

49:42.476 --> 49:47.074
But next time,
let's do... dinner and a movie?

49:51.476 --> 49:54.001
Lyons won't stop.

49:55.643 --> 49:58.096
Best case scenario...

49:58.418 --> 50:01.276
he kills our customers
and doesn't get caught.

50:01.376 --> 50:03.918
Phenotrans will be destroyed.

50:05.626 --> 50:07.459
Worst case...

50:07.559 --> 50:11.218
he finds a way to frame us for it.
Decides he doesn't need us anymore.

50:11.318 --> 50:14.631
Puts us in whatever shallow grave
he dug for those reporters.

50:14.731 --> 50:17.159
You think he'd kill you?

50:18.418 --> 50:22.584
Do you know what the key
to the Phenotrans strength is, Rogers?

50:22.684 --> 50:25.959
Not money.
Not research or patented technology.

50:26.059 --> 50:27.693
It's fear.

50:27.793 --> 50:31.084
Zombie terror and the world's utter
dependence on us for an antidote.

50:31.184 --> 50:33.634
That's how we survive.

50:34.043 --> 50:38.476
As soon as Lyons destroys the virus,
you will release a new strain from our stock.

50:38.876 --> 50:41.168
Rand has gives us a few to choose from.

50:41.268 --> 50:45.268
You know, there are a lot
worse things than losing a company.

50:45.368 --> 50:47.984
Not to me.

50:53.295 --> 50:56.611
You think coming in here
is going to get you off the hook?

50:56.711 --> 51:01.336
- With who?
- Humanity. God, whatever.

51:01.436 --> 51:04.070
I don't know. Maybe, yeah.

51:04.170 --> 51:08.195
- Well, it won't.
- So I save my sister.

51:08.295 --> 51:11.611
Easier just to dig that chip out of her.

51:11.711 --> 51:14.795
Just let another million people die?

51:15.878 --> 51:18.678
Bullshit, man. If that's your attitude,
what are you doing here?

51:18.778 --> 51:20.878
Atonement, same as you.
But I'm not kidding myself.

51:20.978 --> 51:22.970
I know it's not going
to make a lick a difference.

51:23.070 --> 51:28.028
- What's your problem?
- My problem is that they might need you.

51:28.128 --> 51:31.278
So I can't just put a nail in your head
and move on with my life.

51:31.378 --> 51:34.895
If we head north, we can reach
the VA hospital in about a mile.

51:34.995 --> 51:37.278
That sounds about right.

51:37.378 --> 51:40.636
Shit. Quick! Get inside.

52:06.395 --> 52:08.211
Here.

52:39.186 --> 52:41.461
Let's get out of here.

52:43.620 --> 52:45.961
Back it up.

53:04.070 --> 53:05.928
Shit.

53:10.316 --> 53:13.228
We gotta move. Let's go.

53:29.120 --> 53:30.878
Fuck me.

53:32.261 --> 53:35.453
Chase! Hang on, buddy!

53:53.745 --> 53:56.361
- Garth!
- Let's go!

53:56.461 --> 53:58.778
Head for the door.

54:58.484 --> 55:00.712
Head for the door. Head for the door.

55:29.766 --> 55:31.583
Chase!

55:37.758 --> 55:39.625
Go!

55:40.892 --> 55:42.809
Shit.

55:43.641 --> 55:45.500
Fuck.

55:47.391 --> 55:48.925
Fuck.

57:15.456 --> 57:18.948
Sandra? Sandra!

57:19.260 --> 57:21.144
Shit.

01:00:07.135 --> 01:00:08.694
Jordan?

01:00:09.844 --> 01:00:12.127
Come with me.

01:00:12.469 --> 01:00:14.627
Oh, my God.

01:00:19.374 --> 01:00:22.724
- Anybody try to follow you?
- I don't think so.

01:00:23.407 --> 01:00:25.766
I need you to trust me with something.

01:00:25.866 --> 01:00:29.224
- What?
- Somebody you need to talk to.

01:00:30.666 --> 01:00:33.234
- You set me up.
- No, no, no. Stop.

01:00:33.334 --> 01:00:35.957
Relax. I'm on your side.

01:00:36.593 --> 01:00:38.234
I got a story for you.

01:00:39.557 --> 01:00:43.832
Couple of years ago, Army decides to start
using Zombrex chips as weapons.

01:00:43.932 --> 01:00:47.278
So they build a Black Ops site inside
Mission City, so they can test them

01:00:47.378 --> 01:00:50.982
- and run the program once it's operational.
- Afterlife? I know this already.

01:00:51.082 --> 01:00:54.266
Yeah, what you don't know is
when the fail safe idea first came up,

01:00:54.366 --> 01:00:56.449
Ingot and Lyons made a deal, okay?

01:00:56.549 --> 01:00:59.649
Dr. Leo Rand, who is head
of research at Phenotrans,

01:00:59.749 --> 01:01:03.412
is put in charge of making
Afterlife happen. In return,

01:01:03.512 --> 01:01:07.587
Rand gets to use human test subjects
for basically anything he wants to

01:01:07.687 --> 01:01:11.107
in a secret facility
and nobody is watching him.

01:01:11.207 --> 01:01:12.349
What's he working on?

01:01:12.449 --> 01:01:14.693
Presumably a cure, but only Ingot
would know that for sure.

01:01:14.793 --> 01:01:18.432
For two years, he's been in there
torturing and killing his subjects.

01:01:18.532 --> 01:01:21.974
But Ingot doesn't want to stop him because she
thinks he's on the verge of a breakthrough.

01:01:22.074 --> 01:01:26.432
She's hoping he hits the jackpot
before the Army pulls the plug.

01:01:26.532 --> 01:01:31.766
This is footage of the tests
and documents linking Ingot to them.

01:01:35.366 --> 01:01:38.749
It's disturbing, it's criminal.

01:01:38.849 --> 01:01:41.182
But there's more than enough
on there to bury her.

01:01:41.282 --> 01:01:42.577
Why come to me?

01:01:42.677 --> 01:01:47.641
Ingot's willing to do anything she has to,
to save her company, even mass murder.

01:01:48.282 --> 01:01:51.691
She's reached a line
I'm not willing to cross.

01:01:52.974 --> 01:01:57.549
Phenotrans needs a change
of leadership. Right now.

01:02:13.932 --> 01:02:16.016
Are you okay?

01:02:16.116 --> 01:02:18.649
What happened to you?

01:02:21.991 --> 01:02:24.474
They told me you were dead.

01:02:26.116 --> 01:02:29.907
They said you'd been infected
and turned while in custody.

01:02:31.241 --> 01:02:33.924
And that they were forced to terminate.

01:02:34.916 --> 01:02:37.232
I didn't believe it.

01:02:37.332 --> 01:02:40.807
I ran this story with the footage
that you left me.

01:02:41.407 --> 01:02:43.824
But they discredited me.

01:02:43.924 --> 01:02:47.057
They labeled me a conspiracy theorist.

01:02:48.282 --> 01:02:53.649
I pushed for an investigation, but they
deemed it a matter of national security.

01:02:55.216 --> 01:02:57.457
And Lyons skated.

01:02:59.782 --> 01:03:03.657
And everything about
Project Watchtower was classified.

01:03:09.049 --> 01:03:11.341
I failed you.

01:03:14.782 --> 01:03:17.241
I'm so sorry, Jordan.

01:03:23.199 --> 01:03:25.201
I found these guys in the hall.

01:03:27.782 --> 01:03:29.899
Chase! You made it.

01:03:29.999 --> 01:03:32.841
There are infected everywhere.

01:03:34.949 --> 01:03:37.624
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:03:38.782 --> 01:03:41.024
Where's Garth?

01:03:41.424 --> 01:03:45.191
Zombrex didn't work. He turned.

01:03:47.166 --> 01:03:49.657
It's not the same virus.

01:03:55.341 --> 01:03:57.232
Sandra...

01:03:58.607 --> 01:04:00.841
meet Jordan.

01:04:02.657 --> 01:04:04.366
Jordan Blair?

01:04:04.466 --> 01:04:06.616
I was done for.

01:04:06.716 --> 01:04:09.324
She came out of nowhere and saved me.

01:04:10.507 --> 01:04:13.432
Jordan... I'm Sandra.

01:04:13.532 --> 01:04:15.699
Where have you been?

01:04:15.799 --> 01:04:18.149
Rand's hospital.

01:04:20.449 --> 01:04:22.941
There was a breach.

01:04:23.257 --> 01:04:25.191
Eight of us got out.

01:04:25.291 --> 01:04:27.782
We're down to two now.

01:04:30.682 --> 01:04:33.074
You're right about the Zombrex.

01:04:33.174 --> 01:04:35.182
It doesn't work.

01:04:35.666 --> 01:04:38.157
We'll be one soon.

01:04:39.032 --> 01:04:44.633
He's insane, right?
Experimenting on healthy human subjects.

01:04:47.116 --> 01:04:49.199
Injecting them
with new strains of the virus.

01:04:49.299 --> 01:04:52.166
He's created new specimens
that are faster, stronger.

01:04:52.266 --> 01:04:55.291
We were lucky to be part
of the control group.

01:04:56.732 --> 01:04:59.641
But Rand definitely had his favorites.

01:05:02.157 --> 01:05:04.845
This is going to sting a bit.

01:05:05.799 --> 01:05:09.516
I hate to be the asshole here,
but we're running out of time.

01:05:09.616 --> 01:05:12.749
- Where was that breach?
- Ward C.

01:05:12.849 --> 01:05:16.182
Son of a bitch. That was our way in.

01:05:19.474 --> 01:05:25.166
It's sealed off. We've come up through
the tunnels underneath the building.

01:05:25.266 --> 01:05:27.922
Can you lead us back in?

01:05:28.022 --> 01:05:30.898
I don't think that's such a good idea.

01:05:30.998 --> 01:05:33.524
I'm running out of time.

01:05:38.649 --> 01:05:42.624
- We need her, Chase.
- I can't make her go back in there.

01:05:42.724 --> 01:05:45.024
It's my fault what happened to her.

01:05:45.124 --> 01:05:48.982
Over a million lives are at risk
and the clock is ticking.

01:05:49.082 --> 01:05:53.007
This isn't about you or me or her.

01:05:53.107 --> 01:05:55.741
We have to do something
and we have to do it fast,

01:05:55.841 --> 01:05:58.704
no matter how difficult this may be.

01:06:04.432 --> 01:06:06.274
A million lives?

01:06:09.341 --> 01:06:11.216
Yeah.

01:06:13.132 --> 01:06:15.549
More than a million, actually.

01:06:18.139 --> 01:06:20.066
Jordan...

01:06:20.166 --> 01:06:22.724
they're planning on killing everyone...

01:06:22.824 --> 01:06:25.316
who has a chip.

01:06:47.707 --> 01:06:49.672
I'll take you.

01:06:57.132 --> 01:06:59.707
No, no.

01:07:46.574 --> 01:07:48.949
You don't have to go in there.

01:07:52.699 --> 01:07:55.249
From here we go in the tunnels.

01:09:06.670 --> 01:09:10.194
This is it. We're in.

01:09:11.211 --> 01:09:13.736
Rand keeps his failures
on the lower levels.

01:09:13.836 --> 01:09:16.278
Your servers are above them.

01:09:59.470 --> 01:10:01.645
Wait here.

01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:18.592
Come on.

01:10:28.775 --> 01:10:31.317
They didn't deserve to live.

01:10:58.609 --> 01:11:00.434
Hey!

01:11:01.134 --> 01:11:03.425
Who the...

01:11:06.667 --> 01:11:08.509
Move.

01:11:09.167 --> 01:11:11.042
Move!

01:11:15.109 --> 01:11:17.327
- How long?
- If what Hancock told me was correct,

01:11:17.427 --> 01:11:19.384
not long.

01:11:21.017 --> 01:11:23.367
Sit down.

01:11:25.875 --> 01:11:27.767
Okay.

01:11:30.317 --> 01:11:32.467
Alarms are down. Security should be blind.

01:11:32.567 --> 01:11:35.100
- Good.
- Go.

01:11:35.834 --> 01:11:37.925
We're in.

01:11:39.734 --> 01:11:41.509
Okay.

01:11:49.984 --> 01:11:52.895
What might you be?

01:11:57.442 --> 01:11:59.334
Okay.

01:12:02.925 --> 01:12:05.567
This is going to sting a bit.

01:12:19.275 --> 01:12:20.542
What have we got?

01:12:20.642 --> 01:12:23.309
Sir, there's a security breach
in the Project Afterlife lab.

01:12:23.409 --> 01:12:27.475
Well, get them out of there.
Then lock down the firewall.

01:12:28.025 --> 01:12:31.586
- Chase, Jordan just took off. She just ran.
- And you let her go?

01:12:31.686 --> 01:12:33.850
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- I didn't let her go.

01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:37.559
Am I supposed to be watching her?
You think I'm going to derail this?

01:12:38.875 --> 01:12:42.361
They're onto us. Someone on the outside
is sending in counter measures.

01:12:42.461 --> 01:12:45.842
- You didn't think the Army would notice?
- Shut up!

01:12:45.942 --> 01:12:50.219
- Can you get past it?
- Yeah, I think.

01:12:57.434 --> 01:12:59.007
Fuck.

01:13:00.967 --> 01:13:03.400
She went after Rand.

01:13:11.217 --> 01:13:13.235
Sandra...

01:13:13.385 --> 01:13:16.586
I'm sorry, but I have to go after her.

01:13:20.242 --> 01:13:23.759
I know how much she means to you. Just go.

01:13:24.059 --> 01:13:26.075
I'll come back for you.

01:13:26.175 --> 01:13:29.825
- If I beat the clock.
- You will.

01:13:36.275 --> 01:13:38.670
It's all very touching.

01:14:17.388 --> 01:14:19.830
They've got remote access.

01:14:20.747 --> 01:14:23.313
How can I disconnect them?

01:14:23.955 --> 01:14:27.830
You're about to kill a million
and a half people. People! Not zombies.

01:14:27.930 --> 01:14:29.830
- They were infected.
- You're disgusting.

01:14:29.930 --> 01:14:33.955
Afterlife may be ugly, but it's necessary.

01:14:37.247 --> 01:14:38.980
What happens when the next virus hits?

01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:41.755
And the one after that? You're just going
to keep killing people that get sick?

01:14:41.855 --> 01:14:45.322
If the disease can wipe out
my entire family, yeah.

01:14:49.447 --> 01:14:52.888
We're running out of time.
Give me the shortcut.

01:14:53.955 --> 01:14:56.180
I got a chip in my shoulder
and nothing to lose.

01:14:56.280 --> 01:15:00.572
So you're going to give me root access,
and tell me everything I need to know

01:15:00.672 --> 01:15:03.938
or my last seconds on Earth
will be spent blowing your head off.

01:15:04.038 --> 01:15:05.910
But don't worry,

01:15:06.010 --> 01:15:09.456
Afterlife will still happen
just the way you wanted it to.

01:15:09.763 --> 01:15:12.238
You're willing to kill me
to save humanity.

01:15:12.338 --> 01:15:14.988
Are you willing to make
the same sacrifice?

01:15:15.088 --> 01:15:18.380
None of us want to kill anybody,
but I will.

01:15:20.255 --> 01:15:24.672
There's a Telnet port open
in the network security appliance,

01:15:24.772 --> 01:15:26.822
we use it for local management.

01:15:26.922 --> 01:15:30.913
Password is West40@Jackson.

01:15:31.238 --> 01:15:32.264
You can use it to...

01:15:32.364 --> 01:15:35.748
You can control and stop them
from tunneling into the LAN.

01:15:37.738 --> 01:15:41.813
The thing was never designed
to counter an attack from the inside.

01:15:47.972 --> 01:15:50.330
What's your name?

01:15:51.088 --> 01:15:52.905
Todd.

01:15:53.205 --> 01:15:55.438
Thanks, Todd.

01:15:57.547 --> 01:16:00.322
They're circumnavigating
our firewall by island hopping.

01:16:00.422 --> 01:16:02.430
Dammit.

01:16:04.213 --> 01:16:06.280
Sir, the attack's coming
from inside a local network.

01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:08.405
- They have physical access?
- Yeah.

01:16:08.505 --> 01:16:10.549
Stop them.

01:16:13.213 --> 01:16:16.697
This is Lyons. I have a priority strike.

01:16:16.797 --> 01:16:20.297
The target codename is Eagleride.
Destroy immediately.

01:16:20.397 --> 01:16:24.003
<i>Copy that. Time to target, 15 minutes.</i>

01:16:29.522 --> 01:16:32.545
Now this is going to sting a bit.

01:16:43.405 --> 01:16:45.713
When we're done,
what's the fastest way to the roof?

01:16:45.813 --> 01:16:48.280
Fright elevator. Goes direct.

01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:51.013
You guys are taking me with you, right?

01:16:51.113 --> 01:16:53.605
If your intel isn't bullshit.

01:16:54.055 --> 01:16:55.597
They're uploading something to Afterlife.

01:16:55.697 --> 01:16:58.047
I can't stop it,
but I can throttle their upload speed.

01:16:58.147 --> 01:17:00.172
Do it now.

01:17:03.938 --> 01:17:07.688
Shit. They're throttling the upload speed.

01:17:08.688 --> 01:17:12.081
This is taking too long. Way too long.

01:17:13.838 --> 01:17:16.083
I need to speed this up.

01:17:38.647 --> 01:17:40.463
Jordan.

01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:45.505
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm the guy who's going to kill you

01:17:45.605 --> 01:17:48.713
- if you don't get the fuck out of my way.
- I asked you a question.

01:17:50.672 --> 01:17:53.697
All right, go ahead. Shoot.

01:17:54.447 --> 01:17:56.680
<i>Set her free.</i>

01:17:58.655 --> 01:18:00.522
Or...

01:18:00.722 --> 01:18:02.938
find out why you shouldn't.

01:18:03.938 --> 01:18:06.255
What'd you give her?

01:18:09.888 --> 01:18:13.853
- What's RXX 22?
- I'm looking Chase.

01:18:15.738 --> 01:18:19.447
- <i>Another virus?</i>
- A purpose.

01:18:19.547 --> 01:18:20.866
Now we all die eventually,

01:18:20.966 --> 01:18:24.238
but some of us, like her, get a chance
to do something meaningful with it.

01:18:24.338 --> 01:18:28.190
- She's not a lab rat.
- No, that is exactly what she is.

01:18:28.290 --> 01:18:30.753
And if you disconnect this IV,
she will die within two minutes.

01:18:30.853 --> 01:18:33.138
So just step away.

01:18:33.238 --> 01:18:35.514
Keep him talking.

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:40.899
I have been working with her
for two years.

01:18:40.999 --> 01:18:45.265
For two years, I have been
keeping her alive. So fuck off!

01:18:49.013 --> 01:18:51.275
I die, the cure dies with me.

01:19:02.363 --> 01:19:04.797
The coin drops.

01:19:05.297 --> 01:19:08.572
The second this thing is over,
I want you to wipe everything.

01:19:08.672 --> 01:19:11.030
Root directories, everything.

01:19:11.130 --> 01:19:13.250
- You know the protocol?
- Yes, sir.

01:19:17.397 --> 01:19:21.380
- Where are you?
- <i>We're heading into the containment cell.</i>

01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:23.955
<i>We believe Carter's there.</i>

01:19:25.255 --> 01:19:27.505
I understand.

01:19:28.113 --> 01:19:30.763
Start sanitation procedures immediately.

01:19:30.863 --> 01:19:36.230
The time is up. Question is this, does she
mean more to you than the whole human race?

01:19:37.072 --> 01:19:39.305
You're not saving people.

01:19:39.405 --> 01:19:43.547
You're killing them.
Afterlife isn't a cure, it's genocide.

01:19:43.647 --> 01:19:48.104
And you think that is my idea?
The Army gave up on finding a cure.

01:19:48.204 --> 01:19:52.629
<i>Phenotrans doesn't want to find one.
Show me a pharmaceutical company that does.</i>

01:19:52.729 --> 01:19:55.388
- <i>Virus is more profitable than cancer.</i>
- Shit.

01:19:55.488 --> 01:19:58.338
I needed live subjects
to better understand the disease.

01:19:58.488 --> 01:20:00.963
Afterlife was a means of providing them.

01:20:01.663 --> 01:20:05.472
What, you honestly think things don't die
in the name of science? People die.

01:20:05.572 --> 01:20:07.904
Not her. Not today.

01:20:08.004 --> 01:20:10.263
Yes, her, today. She's it.

01:20:10.363 --> 01:20:13.138
This is all coming down.
This thing is over.

01:20:13.238 --> 01:20:16.722
She is the last chance
to save the human race.

01:20:16.822 --> 01:20:18.705
Fuck.

01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:21.338
All right.

01:20:24.505 --> 01:20:26.613
If you die here,

01:20:26.713 --> 01:20:29.047
people will remember you as a monster.

01:20:29.147 --> 01:20:32.338
I'm a reporter. I can tell your story.

01:20:32.738 --> 01:20:35.472
What, do you really think I give
a shit about what people think?

01:20:35.572 --> 01:20:37.497
You think this is about ego?

01:20:37.597 --> 01:20:41.488
If we do nothing,
this virus will wipe us all out completely.

01:20:41.588 --> 01:20:45.388
This is about survival.
This is about salvation.

01:20:45.488 --> 01:20:47.509
Salvation?

01:20:48.188 --> 01:20:50.589
What salvation?

01:20:50.689 --> 01:20:53.505
This test, it's meaningless.

01:20:53.605 --> 01:20:55.847
Okay, because no one
is ever going to fucking see it!

01:20:55.947 --> 01:20:59.213
You know, once they enact Afterlife,
they're going to destroy this place.

01:20:59.313 --> 01:21:03.905
And everything that you have done here
will be for nothing. Nothing!

01:21:04.505 --> 01:21:09.738
Give me the antidote and I will take you
and your research out with us.

01:21:09.838 --> 01:21:13.663
Your results, your data,
whatever you want.

01:21:16.688 --> 01:21:19.455
Jesus Christ, Rand, you're killing her.

01:21:19.655 --> 01:21:23.572
Yeah, I'm trying as hard
as I goddamn can and I hope I fail.

01:21:23.672 --> 01:21:27.113
Because if she survives death,
then there is hope.

01:21:29.963 --> 01:21:32.513
Best thing about this virus...

01:21:33.213 --> 01:21:35.572
victims can't die.

01:21:45.288 --> 01:21:47.672
This is going too slow.

01:21:51.113 --> 01:21:53.330
We're screwed.

01:21:57.688 --> 01:21:59.563
Hancock!

01:22:02.922 --> 01:22:05.397
Son of a bitch.

01:22:07.188 --> 01:22:09.872
Where others saw disease...

01:22:10.729 --> 01:22:12.838
I saw a miracle.

01:22:12.938 --> 01:22:16.796
With small adjustments to the RNA,
the virus, in theory,

01:22:16.896 --> 01:22:19.279
could co-exist with human tissue.

01:22:19.379 --> 01:22:23.071
And that is a permanent form
of regeneration.

01:22:23.171 --> 01:22:26.096
Cells that never die.

01:22:28.171 --> 01:22:30.279
You're talking about immortality.

01:22:30.379 --> 01:22:34.729
That is the cure. And she is the research.

01:22:34.829 --> 01:22:39.063
The only way to test it
is to kill the subject.

01:22:40.188 --> 01:22:42.879
You really are fucking crazy.

01:22:45.504 --> 01:22:48.041
Hancock, what are you doing here?

01:22:56.021 --> 01:22:57.979
There it is.

01:22:58.079 --> 01:23:01.234
Chase, have you ever had
a trillion dollars in your hand?

01:23:02.188 --> 01:23:04.688
- Me neither.
- Why?

01:23:04.788 --> 01:23:07.038
Eternal life.

01:23:07.138 --> 01:23:09.111
Endless money.

01:23:21.788 --> 01:23:23.554
Jordan.

01:23:26.188 --> 01:23:31.604
- Chase, the antidote is R-E-D 1.
- Got it.

01:23:37.929 --> 01:23:39.871
We are so screwed. Do you have a tool box?

01:23:39.971 --> 01:23:43.155
- You can't manually speed up a network.
- I said, do you have a fucking tool box?

01:23:43.255 --> 01:23:45.321
In there.

01:23:51.804 --> 01:23:53.638
Shit.

01:24:23.121 --> 01:24:26.004
- Shit.
- We gotta go. We gotta go now.

01:24:27.054 --> 01:24:29.679
Chase, we're about to have company.

01:24:30.788 --> 01:24:33.221
Where are we on the hack?

01:24:34.421 --> 01:24:35.429
I'm down to the wire.

01:24:35.529 --> 01:24:38.488
You said you'd take me with you,
we gotta get to the roof.

01:24:38.588 --> 01:24:40.179
Let's go!

01:24:45.121 --> 01:24:46.838
Yeah.

01:25:06.963 --> 01:25:08.346
Jeez.

01:25:34.263 --> 01:25:36.754
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- It's not personal.

01:25:36.854 --> 01:25:39.988
- Fuck you.
- We'll die if we stay here.

01:25:41.588 --> 01:25:43.328
Shit.

01:25:44.428 --> 01:25:47.254
We gotta go now. We gotta get to the roof.

01:25:47.354 --> 01:25:49.738
I'm not done yet!

01:25:50.088 --> 01:25:54.554
Goddamn it. You can't beat it.
Let's save ourselves at least.

01:25:54.654 --> 01:25:56.997
Come on, you bastard.

01:26:02.379 --> 01:26:04.704
Hey! Hey!

01:26:05.647 --> 01:26:08.279
Hey! Hey!

01:26:09.104 --> 01:26:12.646
Come on! Come on! Let's go! We gotta go!

01:26:12.746 --> 01:26:15.143
We're not leaving until I've moved on.

01:26:15.243 --> 01:26:17.563
- We gotta go now.
- Fight them off!

01:26:17.963 --> 01:26:19.893
Yes!

01:26:21.338 --> 01:26:23.196
Fuck!

01:26:28.163 --> 01:26:32.078
You can't save them.
You're wasting time. We gotta go.

01:26:32.178 --> 01:26:34.436
Keep them back.

01:26:38.148 --> 01:26:40.818
- Yes!
- Goddammit!

01:26:56.413 --> 01:27:00.385
- Destroy it! Destroy it all.
- Affirmative. Locking on coordinates.

01:29:35.085 --> 01:29:36.918
Fuck.

01:29:43.918 --> 01:29:46.643
- Jordan.
- Yes, Chase.

01:29:48.626 --> 01:29:50.946
- Can you run?
- Yeah.

01:29:51.046 --> 01:29:53.834
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:30:33.792 --> 01:30:35.617
Chuck!

01:30:48.459 --> 01:30:50.776
One minute to target.

01:31:06.976 --> 01:31:09.234
Let's go!

01:31:19.842 --> 01:31:22.187
Target acquired.

01:31:30.792 --> 01:31:32.092
Thanks, Chuck.

01:31:32.192 --> 01:31:35.142
Are you kidding me?
After what you did for my daughter?

01:31:35.242 --> 01:31:37.476
Thank you.

01:32:26.790 --> 01:32:29.181
George Hancock?

01:32:34.098 --> 01:32:37.140
Leave him. Something will come along
and eat him soon enough.

01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:39.331
Yes, sir.
