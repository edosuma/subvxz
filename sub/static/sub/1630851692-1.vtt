13:36.782 --> 13:38.449
[Karen] Oh, wait.
Let me get my mic off.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.885
Hey, can you guys take these
mics off me?

13:40.920 --> 13:43.421
I just wanna have
a private conversation.

13:43.455 --> 13:45.423
I just wanna talk to my son.

13:58.971 --> 14:00.638
[man] You ready?

14:02.441 --> 14:04.375
Rolling again.

14:05.411 --> 14:07.212
[producer speaking]

14:07.246 --> 14:10.415
[Karen] You know, he just
said they needed some space.

14:10.449 --> 14:12.283
They told me that they're okay.

14:12.318 --> 14:15.153
Angenette told me she was
embarrassed about everything

14:15.187 --> 14:17.922
that happened and they
apologized and I just wanna

14:17.957 --> 14:20.792
give them some more time,
give them some room.

14:21.794 --> 14:23.294
I mean, they need help.

14:23.329 --> 14:27.398
They need to get
some marital counseling.

14:27.433 --> 14:29.734
They need to work
through whatever it is

14:29.768 --> 14:32.070
that they have going on.

14:32.104 --> 14:36.140
They need to heal
and that I do respect.

14:37.543 --> 14:40.345
Oh, my dang.

14:40.379 --> 14:44.048
<i>I disagree with the way
I was treated</i>

14:44.083 --> 14:45.450
<i>but we've had time to heal.</i>

14:45.484 --> 14:48.920
And I don't want him
or Angenette to think that

14:48.954 --> 14:51.556
we're stewing over any of that.

14:51.590 --> 14:54.492
So, I am willing to give them
the space

14:54.526 --> 14:57.095
that they want and need.

[Karen speaking]

19:01.673 --> 19:03.975
[Chantel] I am so glad
to be done with school

19:04.009 --> 19:05.209
and graduating...

19:05.244 --> 19:06.410
She is.

19:06.445 --> 19:08.212
Yes, I am.

19:08.247 --> 19:12.216
<i>But graduating during
a pandemic is so weird.</i>

19:12.251 --> 19:14.585
I'm not gonna be able to walk
across the stage in my cap

19:14.620 --> 19:16.454
and gown with all
of my family there.

19:16.488 --> 19:19.457
Instead, we're having
a drive-thru parade

19:19.491 --> 19:23.294
but we're still going
to have a graduation party.

19:23.328 --> 19:28.399
Yes, a fabulous graduation
party with all the trimmings.

19:28.433 --> 19:31.169
Oh, here's the
graduation things.

19:31.203 --> 19:32.503
[Karen] Okay.

19:32.538 --> 19:35.206
[Chantel] I always imagined
that I was going to have

19:35.240 --> 19:36.741
my graduation...

19:36.775 --> 19:38.442
- [Karen] Mmm-hmm.
- walk across the stage

19:38.477 --> 19:39.544
and that's been taken from me.

19:39.578 --> 19:41.479
- [Karen] Well, guess what?
- All we're doing

19:41.513 --> 19:43.414
is a car parade...

19:43.448 --> 19:45.616
Then we're gonna make
your car fabulous

19:45.651 --> 19:46.784
and I mean fabulous.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.019
Just sucks.

19:48.053 --> 19:50.555
[Karen] We're going to have
fun and I'll be there,

19:50.589 --> 19:52.056
daddy will be there.

19:52.090 --> 19:55.493
River will be there.
Your sister will be there.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.295
[Chantel] Do you think
that Winter is gonna bring

19:57.329 --> 19:58.796
Jah to my party?

19:58.830 --> 20:02.233
We'll just have
to play it by ear.

20:02.267 --> 20:05.603
It was only a couple of weeks
into the quarantine

20:05.637 --> 20:08.239
after we got back
from the Philippines.

20:08.273 --> 20:10.474
Winter just moved back
in with Jah.

20:10.509 --> 20:12.476
But she's always done that.

20:12.511 --> 20:14.545
Winter has been going back
and forth with Jah.

20:14.580 --> 20:16.414
You know, breaking up
and getting back together.

20:16.448 --> 20:18.249
<i>So, this is nothing new.</i>

20:18.283 --> 20:21.919
[Karen] I mean,
last time I saw Jah,

20:21.954 --> 20:23.521
it was very awkward.

20:23.555 --> 20:25.056
[upbeat music playing]

20:25.090 --> 20:27.325
[Karen] Jah, I know
you have a son

20:27.359 --> 20:30.261
and I know Winter doesn't know.

20:30.295 --> 20:31.696
- Is it true?
- This is strange.

20:31.763 --> 20:33.297
This is not how...

20:33.332 --> 20:35.499
Uh, I wanted to get
the chance to tell it,

20:35.534 --> 20:38.135
talk to Winter, you know?
Winter.

20:38.170 --> 20:40.037
Y'all got paperwork too, like,

20:40.072 --> 20:42.173
so what, you're all doing
the investigations on me

20:42.207 --> 20:44.275
- and then whatnot?
- Definitely. Most definitely.

20:44.309 --> 20:45.142
Y'all set this up.

20:45.177 --> 20:48.246
You set this up for yourself.

20:49.014 --> 20:52.383
<i>[Karen] If he wants to have
a relationship with Winter,</i>

20:52.417 --> 20:57.021
I think that Jah needs
to prove himself.

20:57.055 --> 20:59.156
Not only to Winter but to us.

20:59.191 --> 21:02.226
[Chantel] I already know
he's not somebody

21:02.261 --> 21:04.795
who I want for my sister.

21:10.168 --> 21:11.702
Have you seen Royal?

21:11.770 --> 21:13.271
[Karen] No, no.
As a matter of fact,

21:13.305 --> 21:14.472
I've called him.

21:14.506 --> 21:16.474
He is not answering his phone.

21:16.508 --> 21:19.543
I've called Angenette's number.

21:19.578 --> 21:21.412
I mean, I have...
I have even gone up there.

21:21.446 --> 21:23.714
Why did you go to Royal's house?

21:23.782 --> 21:26.784
[Karen] I was really
worried about him

21:26.918 --> 21:30.354
and Angenette. And I wanted
to know if they were okay.

21:30.389 --> 21:32.156
I'm exhausted with it.

21:32.190 --> 21:35.059
I feel like I can't
torment myself with that.

21:35.093 --> 21:37.962
I have to move on.

21:37.996 --> 21:40.531
[Karen] I know you're upset
with him as was I,

21:40.565 --> 21:42.500
but you love your brother.
You know that.

21:42.534 --> 21:44.502
- I do.
- [Karen] You know, it would...

21:44.536 --> 21:46.437
it would be great
if we could all be together

21:46.471 --> 21:49.273
at your party.
I would love to have Royal

21:49.308 --> 21:52.076
at the party. But the way
he is treating me right now,

21:52.110 --> 21:56.180
I know he needs, I guess, space.

21:57.249 --> 21:59.450
[Chantel] The Philippines
trip is still fresh

21:59.484 --> 22:02.019
in our minds. And for me,
I feel like

22:02.054 --> 22:05.556
if they want to be together,
we can't stop them.

22:05.590 --> 22:08.326
Oh, we don't have any
intention to stop them

22:08.360 --> 22:12.530
but my hope is that they both
get some help and get their...

22:12.564 --> 22:15.466
Get those issues taken care of.

22:15.500 --> 22:18.069
<i>In this family, we're all
for one and one for all.</i>

22:18.103 --> 22:20.137
No one gets left behind.

22:20.172 --> 22:24.775
All for one, Chantel, and...

22:24.910 --> 22:27.311
- One for all.
- [Karen] ...one for all.

[guitar music playing]

23:07.886 --> 23:09.920

we doing here, Dad?

23:09.955 --> 23:12.323

we're decorating the cars.

23:12.357 --> 23:13.290

We're getting to it.

23:15.494 --> 23:18.229
[Karen] I'm giving the car
its own face mask.

23:18.263 --> 23:19.430
- There it is.
- [man] For the corona.

23:19.464 --> 23:20.598
Oh, look at it, yeah.

23:20.632 --> 23:24.068
[Karen] Chantel is finally
graduating but it's...

23:24.102 --> 23:26.003
we're in the middle
of the pandemic,

23:26.037 --> 23:27.972

face mask
I made one for the car,

23:37.015 --> 23:39.383
and the balloons and signs

23:39.418 --> 23:42.153
and antennas and pompoms.

- Yes.
- Yeah.

to get in line.

23:59.604 --> 24:01.372

proud of me right now. And...

24:01.406 --> 24:02.373
[Pedro speaking]

24:02.407 --> 24:04.108
[Chantel] You out
of anybody should know...

24:04.142 --> 24:05.709
- [Pedro speaking]
- [Chantel] ...how much

24:05.744 --> 24:06.744

It's a big deal.
Not only did she graduate,

24:48.854 --> 24:51.121
she graduated with her
bachelor's and she's a nurse.

24:51.156 --> 24:54.225
Nobody can call her
a dumb-ass bitch.

24:54.259 --> 24:55.960

- Talk her up. Talk her up.

[Winter] I'm so proud of Chantel

25:07.339 --> 25:11.141
for sticking it out
and going after her dreams.

25:11.176 --> 25:12.343
- Mmm-hmm.
- And this is what she

- Does anybody need

25:31.429 --> 25:33.264
their temperature checked?

25:33.298 --> 25:35.332
- [Pedro speaking] [bleep]

Somehow, I don't think
it's as much as you're

26:52.110 --> 26:54.478
thinking it's going to be.

26:54.512 --> 26:57.281
For starting out, I think
it's below 50,000.

26:57.315 --> 26:59.617
- I think it's like 45,000.
- [Pedro speaking]

26:59.651 --> 27:01.952
Forty-five, fifty, uh, uh,

27:01.987 --> 27:04.321
I'm not sure, baby.
I'm entry level.

27:04.356 --> 27:06.757
I'm at the bottom.
But I'm sure I can work

27:06.891 --> 27:08.125
my way up to the top.

27:08.159 --> 27:10.561
[Pedro speaking]

27:14.466 --> 27:15.332
Really?

27:15.367 --> 27:16.433
[Pedro speaking]

27:18.036 --> 27:20.571
I think that what you
thought was when I graduate,

going to school,

36:18.309 --> 36:20.844
I had a long distance

36:20.878 --> 36:22.779
I was going to see him,
and coming back,

36:22.880 --> 36:26.316
and then decided to do
the K-1 visa, and, um,

36:26.350 --> 36:29.553
the expenses that
it just comes with K-1 visa

36:29.587 --> 36:31.221

So it took me
a little bit longer.

what are you up to these days?

to have a career.

Jah since the big blowup.
