00:34.374 --> 00:35.686
No.

00:35.721 --> 00:37.787
No, no!

00:57.408 --> 00:58.903
You want to do something tonight?

00:58.923 --> 01:00.777
Sure. If you want.

01:01.664 --> 01:04.147
- Sure.
- Like what?

01:05.554 --> 01:07.887
We could, um, go watch a movie.

01:07.907 --> 01:09.729
Yeah. Yeah, if you want to.

01:09.749 --> 01:10.921
Well, not if you don't want to.

01:10.941 --> 01:12.874
- No, if you want to, I-I want to.
- You know what?

01:12.894 --> 01:14.462
We've watched a lot of movies
over the past couple weeks.

01:14.482 --> 01:15.798
Yeah.

01:16.071 --> 01:21.497
So, maybe we could,
you know, if you wanted...

01:23.215 --> 01:24.601
If I wanted to what?

01:24.635 --> 01:28.067
I mean,
we could try something else tonight.

01:30.726 --> 01:32.141
Something else as in...

01:32.176 --> 01:34.643
Yeah, I mean, we haven't since...

01:34.678 --> 01:36.446
Yeah, well,
given everything that's happened,

01:36.480 --> 01:39.815
I thought you just... you weren't... ready.

01:39.849 --> 01:42.141
I thought that <i>you</i> weren't ready.

01:42.786 --> 01:43.719
I'm ready.

01:43.753 --> 01:45.654
I'm... I

01:46.447 --> 01:48.423
I'm... I'm so ready.

01:48.458 --> 01:50.584
I-I'm ready, too. Like, I'm really ready.

01:50.604 --> 01:52.094
Okay. Well, then what are we waiting for?

02:00.463 --> 02:01.952
What?

02:02.803 --> 02:04.906
- You promise?
- Yes, we'll pick up where we left off.

02:04.940 --> 02:06.975
I'll even slip into that
Valentine's day gift you got me.

02:07.009 --> 02:08.977
- You mean the one with...
- Mm-hmm.

02:09.011 --> 02:10.211
- With...
- Yeah.

02:17.022 --> 02:18.188
Oh.

02:18.437 --> 02:21.147
Is that a pool cue through his chest?

02:21.167 --> 02:23.224
Guess we don't have to ask how he died.

02:23.258 --> 02:27.597
Inferior vena cava was punctured.
He bled out in minutes.

02:27.617 --> 02:28.730
And when did that happen?

02:28.764 --> 02:30.865
The couple in the unit downstairs

02:30.899 --> 02:33.367
heard a struggle at 7:50 and called 911.

02:33.401 --> 02:34.968
They said it sounded
like a hell of a fight.

02:35.003 --> 02:37.804
Victim's name is William Fairwick.
He was 25.

02:37.839 --> 02:39.106
What else do we know about him?

02:39.141 --> 02:40.974
Other than his taste in anarchy tattoos

02:41.009 --> 02:43.076
and satanic design, not much yet.

02:43.111 --> 02:46.046
His laptop and phone were
both password protected.

02:46.080 --> 02:47.681
So sorry. Subway took forever.

02:47.715 --> 02:49.516
Bro, you're supposed to be on call.

02:49.550 --> 02:51.084
Why do you smell like a wino?

02:51.119 --> 02:52.719
Oh, I was at dinner with Jenny,

02:52.754 --> 02:56.424
and someone spilled a drink
on me as I rushed out.

02:57.379 --> 02:58.896
- Beckett.
- Yeah.

02:58.916 --> 03:02.297
The debris from this breakage
goes from left to right.

03:02.483 --> 03:04.444
So, whoever did it was left handed.

03:04.464 --> 03:05.859
Most likely invited.

03:05.879 --> 03:07.833
All the doors and windows
were locked from the inside,

03:07.868 --> 03:09.935
and despite the wreckage,
there's no sign of forced entry.

03:09.970 --> 03:11.437
Was anything stolen?

03:11.472 --> 03:12.972
None of the obvious valuables,

03:13.006 --> 03:15.941
but I did find this stashed in
the back of his sock drawer.

03:15.976 --> 03:17.677
It's $20,000 in cash.

03:17.711 --> 03:19.445
Could be what the killer was looking for.

03:19.480 --> 03:21.047
That's pretty risky leaving it here.

03:21.081 --> 03:22.581
What did this guy do for a living?

03:22.615 --> 03:24.747
Hey, check it out.
I found his work I.D.

03:25.814 --> 03:29.085
It says here "Greenblatt Insurance."

03:29.105 --> 03:30.856
I'll track it down,
see if it has any relevance.

03:30.891 --> 03:33.525
Oh, my God, Will?!

03:34.118 --> 03:35.928
What happened?

03:37.430 --> 03:39.987
Yeah, we've been neighbors for two years.

03:40.007 --> 03:42.444
We played video games after work sometimes.

03:42.464 --> 03:43.702
I was just seeing if he was around.

03:43.736 --> 03:45.437
Were you here all night, Henry?

03:45.753 --> 03:46.805
Yeah.

03:46.839 --> 03:48.240
So, did you hear anything?

03:48.274 --> 03:52.106
Sorry, I've been laying siege
to the fortress of kobald all night.

03:52.126 --> 03:53.583
From "Terra Quest"?

03:53.603 --> 03:56.710
What are you... a wily westland ghoul?
Menacing south river orc?

03:56.730 --> 03:57.889
Oh!

03:57.909 --> 03:59.338
East mountain goblin.

03:59.847 --> 04:02.143
I'm, uh, their king, actually.

04:02.738 --> 04:04.066
Respect.

04:04.401 --> 04:05.489
Anyway, back to the real world.

04:05.524 --> 04:09.327
So, did Will exhibit any
odd behavior recently?

04:09.361 --> 04:10.695
No. It was pretty much the same routine.

04:10.729 --> 04:12.296
I mean, he'd go to work in the morning,
come home at night.

04:12.331 --> 04:14.298
Okay.
Did he talk about any of his other friends?

04:14.333 --> 04:15.833
Was he having troubles with anyone?

04:15.867 --> 04:18.369
We didn't talk much about real-life stuff.

04:18.403 --> 04:20.571
It was mainly just "Terra Quest."

04:20.606 --> 04:22.039
But if he was having a problem,

04:22.072 --> 04:23.841
it probably had something to
do with how he made his money.

04:23.875 --> 04:25.576
At Greenblatt Insurance?

04:25.611 --> 04:28.045
Claims adjuster, that...
that was just his day job.

04:28.079 --> 04:31.472
He was making a fortune every
night over at Chelsea Billiards.

04:31.794 --> 04:33.457
Guy was a pool hustler.

04:33.656 --> 04:36.319
That explains the cold,
hard cash we found in his sock drawer.

04:36.354 --> 04:38.830
And the pool cue we found in his chest.

04:41.874 --> 04:44.594
Yeah. Will worked my tables.

04:44.629 --> 04:46.563
He was the best I ever seen.

04:46.597 --> 04:48.131
Knew all the angles.

04:48.165 --> 04:50.467
Anyone he took for money
ever have a problem with him?

04:50.501 --> 04:53.136
Sure, but Will mostly
hustled Wall Street tools

04:53.170 --> 04:54.337
for 10 bills a game.

04:56.440 --> 04:59.609
Losing a grand here or there
is chump change for them.

04:59.644 --> 05:02.444
None of those guys would
ever kill Will over a bet.

05:02.479 --> 05:04.657
But there are guys that would?

05:04.819 --> 05:06.949
Will always worked
- the upscale clubs like mine

05:06.984 --> 05:11.053
where it's safe to take
money off the clientele.

05:11.088 --> 05:13.555
But recently,
I'd heard that he started hustling

05:13.590 --> 05:16.901
out in Brooklyn at O'Neill's.

05:16.921 --> 05:19.966
That place is full of felons and lowlifes.

05:19.986 --> 05:22.230
Any idea why he decided
to move his game up there?

05:22.265 --> 05:25.434
Well, it wasn't for the money.
I mean, he was cleaning up here.

05:26.041 --> 05:27.269
But, uh...

05:28.125 --> 05:31.493
what people say and do...

05:31.513 --> 05:33.735
doesn't always make sense.

05:35.236 --> 05:36.912
Mr. Shepherd?

05:37.941 --> 05:40.361
No, it's probably nothing.

05:40.845 --> 05:41.917
It's stupid, even.

05:41.951 --> 05:43.885
It's not stupid if it could help us

05:43.920 --> 05:46.482
fill in the blanks on Will's life.

05:51.583 --> 05:54.094
I once asked him
how he got to be so good.

05:55.156 --> 05:58.176
He told me he went down to the crossroads,

05:58.196 --> 06:01.105
made a deal with the devil for his talent.

06:01.125 --> 06:04.294
I figured that's... that...
that's got to be a joke, right?

06:04.314 --> 06:07.007
But the other night, he looked nervous.
I mean, downright scared,

06:07.042 --> 06:09.509
so I asked him, I said, "what's going on?"

06:09.544 --> 06:10.978
You know what he told me?

06:11.012 --> 06:14.315
No, but I want to know.

06:17.091 --> 06:19.353
He said it wasn't a joke.

06:19.834 --> 06:22.651
He said his time was up...

06:23.209 --> 06:26.326
that he was about to lose his soul.

06:29.464 --> 06:34.100
Well, like I said, though,
uh, stupid, right?

06:39.725 --> 06:42.641
Espo's got something
for us at the precinct.

06:42.676 --> 06:45.378
A guy says he's gonna lose
his soul and then he does?

06:45.412 --> 06:46.612
How creepy is that?

06:46.646 --> 06:49.115
The guy was hustling felons
and he got himself killed.

06:49.149 --> 06:52.318
That's not creepy, that's probable cause.

06:52.353 --> 06:53.519
Anything on our vic's employer?

06:53.553 --> 06:54.754
Uh, yeah.

06:54.788 --> 06:56.989
I got a 1-800 number for
Greenblatt Insurance,

06:57.023 --> 06:58.724
but they're closed until tomorrow.

06:58.759 --> 07:00.860
Can you stop by O'Neill's bar
in Brooklyn on your way home,

07:00.894 --> 07:03.330
- ask around about the vic?
- Uh...

07:03.565 --> 07:06.295
- Unless Jenny needs you?
- No, all good.

07:07.801 --> 07:09.201
Espo, what do we got?

07:09.235 --> 07:10.669
I pulled security
footage from Will's building.

07:10.704 --> 07:12.871
There's a security camera
in the elevator area

07:12.906 --> 07:14.873
slightly angled towards Will's apartment.

07:14.908 --> 07:16.741
I was able to magnify the footage.

07:16.776 --> 07:19.813
Great, then we should be able to pull an
image of our killer leaving the apartment.

07:19.833 --> 07:22.817
We should, yeah, but... watch.

07:25.423 --> 07:27.419
This is a minute before the 911 call.

07:27.453 --> 07:29.687
And this is minutes later.

07:30.539 --> 07:33.525
The door opens and closes on its own,

07:33.559 --> 07:36.327
and then no one enters or exits
the apartment until police arrive,

07:36.361 --> 07:38.229
and all the windows
were locked from the inside.

07:38.263 --> 07:39.330
That's impossible.

07:39.364 --> 07:41.433
The killer had to get in and out somehow.

07:41.467 --> 07:44.602
Uh, can you play that again?

07:45.748 --> 07:48.106
There's your killer right there.

07:48.342 --> 07:49.273
Don't you see?

07:49.308 --> 07:50.998
Will made a deal with the devil.

07:51.018 --> 07:53.877
The contract was up, so it was time to pay.

07:53.912 --> 07:56.590
The devil came and got his due.

07:59.544 --> 08:02.025
S07E03
Clear & Present Danger

08:02.150 --> 08:04.880
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

08:06.442 --> 08:07.237
Really?

08:07.257 --> 08:08.938
That's how the devil is
gonna kill someone...

08:08.958 --> 08:10.345
using a broken pool stick?

08:10.379 --> 08:13.225
Well, perhaps the prince of darkness
is trying to make a point.

08:13.245 --> 08:15.334
You live by the cue, you die by the cue.

08:15.354 --> 08:17.953
Thought he usually just
released the hell hounds.

08:17.973 --> 08:20.354
All right, then how do you explain
what we just saw back there?

08:20.388 --> 08:21.956
Easy.

08:21.990 --> 08:24.891
Will didn't close the door all
the way when he came back in.

08:24.925 --> 08:25.925
Our window was open.

08:25.960 --> 08:27.160
The killer came through,

08:27.194 --> 08:30.096
and this huge gust of
wind forced the door open

08:30.131 --> 08:32.097
and then shut when they left.

08:32.133 --> 08:36.416
But Esposito said all the windows were
locked from the inside.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.270
Our killer's a pro.

08:38.289 --> 08:40.539
He knows how to reset interior locks.

08:40.573 --> 08:43.909
Except Will lives on the 19th
floor with no fire escape.

08:43.943 --> 08:45.311
Come on, Castle.

08:45.345 --> 08:47.580
You know that there are plenty
of ways to access windows

08:47.614 --> 08:49.415
on high-level floors without a fire escape.

08:49.449 --> 08:51.350
Yes. If you're spider-man.

08:51.385 --> 08:53.052
Our killer's not spider-man.

08:53.087 --> 08:55.009
Agreed... Because it's the devil.

08:55.195 --> 08:56.889
The only place
that we're gonna find the devil

08:56.923 --> 08:58.658
in this case is in the details.

08:58.692 --> 09:00.826
Once we find out more about Will's life,

09:00.860 --> 09:04.145
then we Will uncover
who his earthbound enemy is.

09:04.165 --> 09:05.155
Tomorrow.

09:05.175 --> 09:09.846
Tonight, I have something I'd
like to uncover back at home.

09:09.866 --> 09:12.397
Don't answer that.

09:13.339 --> 09:15.174
Don't. Don't even. Don't look at it.

09:15.208 --> 09:16.508
- Don't answer it.
- I just want...

09:16.542 --> 09:18.295
Don't pick it up.

09:18.315 --> 09:19.767
You picked it up.

09:19.990 --> 09:20.971
Beckett.

09:20.991 --> 09:23.018
- Oh, lanie. Yes.
- Lanie!

09:23.440 --> 09:25.655
Okay. I'll be right there.

09:26.786 --> 09:29.087
On closer examination of the body,

09:29.122 --> 09:31.656
I found multiple stress fractures here

09:31.691 --> 09:33.692
on the victim's left wrist.

09:33.726 --> 09:35.327
From what?

09:35.361 --> 09:38.029
Well, they're consistent with flexion,
extension,

09:38.063 --> 09:39.130
and hyperextension,

09:39.164 --> 09:41.700
as a left-handed person
would experience if...

09:41.734 --> 09:44.918
They grabbed a pool cue
and smashed everything to bits.

09:44.938 --> 09:46.904
So, Will's left handed.

09:46.939 --> 09:49.907
Are you saying that Will
destroyed his own apartment?

09:51.997 --> 09:52.844
Wow.

09:52.878 --> 09:55.479
Swinging a pool cue
blindly to defend himself?

09:55.513 --> 09:57.014
Telling you, it makes perfect sense.

09:57.049 --> 10:00.517
What would you do if you were attacked
by an invisible demonic force?

10:00.537 --> 10:03.587
I'd tell Ryan to lay off
the bean burritos at lunch.

10:04.029 --> 10:05.369
Hey, guys.

10:05.704 --> 10:07.524
- Hey, Ryan.
- So, you were right.

10:07.559 --> 10:10.761
Will's troubles may have followed him home
from O'Neill's pool hall.

10:10.795 --> 10:12.596
I spoke with several witnesses who said

10:12.630 --> 10:15.332
that he got into an
altercation there last week

10:15.367 --> 10:17.534
with an ex-con named Jiggy Michaels.

10:17.569 --> 10:19.169
How serious was the altercation?

10:19.203 --> 10:21.471
Well, Jiggy smashed a beer bottle,
threatened to kill him.

10:21.505 --> 10:23.039
Several people had to hold him back.

10:23.074 --> 10:24.241
That qualifies as serious.

10:24.275 --> 10:26.109
Apparently,
Will hustled him out of 20 grand.

10:26.143 --> 10:28.644
That's the exact same amount of
money we found at his apartment.

10:28.679 --> 10:33.031
Plus, Jiggy has over a dozen priors,
including multiple B&Es.

10:33.051 --> 10:36.051
He can get in and out undetected.
They call him the ghost.

10:36.086 --> 10:39.955
Wow. A real-world killer who
can get in and out undetected.

10:39.990 --> 10:41.991
Now, that makes perfect sense.

10:42.025 --> 10:43.999
I want a lawyer.

10:44.272 --> 10:46.002
This ain't my first rodeo.

10:46.022 --> 10:46.662
Hmm.

10:46.697 --> 10:47.830
Well, that is too bad,

10:47.865 --> 10:50.710
because a lawyer
is gonna tell you not to talk.

10:50.730 --> 10:52.401
And how are you gonna
explain to a grand jury

10:52.435 --> 10:55.237
that you threatened
to kill a guy who hustled you,

10:55.272 --> 10:57.523
and then, three days later,
he ended up dead?

10:57.543 --> 10:59.875
As a second-story man for
several crime outfits,

10:59.910 --> 11:01.843
you knew how to break
into Fairwick's place,

11:01.878 --> 11:03.612
but when you couldn't find your money,

11:03.646 --> 11:05.114
you settled on revenge instead.

11:05.148 --> 11:07.649
We've got a taxi receipt

11:07.683 --> 11:09.584
dropping you off at Chelsea last night,

11:09.619 --> 11:11.352
three blocks from Will's apartment.

11:11.387 --> 11:15.135
That's a long way from your
place in Cypress Hills, Jiggy.

11:17.021 --> 11:18.927
My boyfriend lives in Chelsea.

11:18.961 --> 11:20.128
I was with him all night.

11:20.162 --> 11:22.644
And Will didn't hustle me. He cheated me.

11:22.664 --> 11:25.733
Half a game in,
that cujo bet me double or nothing

11:25.753 --> 11:27.802
and cleared the rest of the
table with a single shot.

11:27.836 --> 11:29.103
What are you talking about?

11:29.138 --> 11:33.937
It was like that cue ball
was possessed or something.

11:34.521 --> 11:35.843
<i>No one is that good or that lucky,</i>

11:35.877 --> 11:38.541
<i>so, yeah, I got pissed,
but I didn't kill the guy.</i>

11:38.926 --> 11:40.982
<i>In fact, Will tracked me down the next day</i>

11:41.002 --> 11:43.451
- and offered to give the money back.
- Really?

11:43.485 --> 11:46.186
He was just gonna pay you back $20,000,

11:46.220 --> 11:47.888
what, out of the kindness of his heart?

11:47.923 --> 11:49.189
In exchange for some knowledge.

11:49.223 --> 11:51.224
That's some expensive knowledge.
What did you do for him?

11:51.259 --> 11:53.270
I didn't do anything. We just talked.

11:53.290 --> 11:55.548
So, what did Will want to know?

11:55.958 --> 11:58.165
He wanted me to case a brownstone
on the Upper East Side.

11:58.199 --> 11:59.899
That sounds
like more than talking.

11:59.934 --> 12:01.701
I don't do that stuff anymore.

12:02.638 --> 12:04.653
Will just asked how he
could break in himself.

12:04.673 --> 12:07.155
Why?
What was so special about that brownstone?

12:07.428 --> 12:10.225
I don't know, but it wasn't gonna be easy.

12:10.245 --> 12:11.755
I mean, place had the works...

12:11.775 --> 12:14.567
motion detectors,
pressure and thermal sensors.

12:15.349 --> 12:17.438
You'd have to be nuts
to try to go in there.

12:17.458 --> 12:20.099
What do you say that we forget

12:20.119 --> 12:22.120
that you were acting like
the Wikipedia of B&Es?

12:22.140 --> 12:25.557
And you give us the
address of that brownstone.

12:28.061 --> 12:31.669
There was a break-in at 39 east 70th street

12:31.689 --> 12:33.319
earlier this week, and the owner,

12:33.339 --> 12:35.478
Tom Talmadge, was assaulted.

12:35.535 --> 12:37.002
Tom Talmadge?

12:37.036 --> 12:39.738
He's the founder of that
ride-share service, Hytch.

12:39.773 --> 12:42.140
The stupid cars with
the thumbs on the roof?

12:42.175 --> 12:44.343
Laugh all you want.
That app made him a billionaire.

12:44.377 --> 12:46.812
What's Will doing breaking
into a billionaire's house?

12:46.846 --> 12:48.613
I don't know, but here's the weird thing.

12:48.647 --> 12:52.317
Tom was hospitalized and he refused
to give a description of the attacker.

12:52.351 --> 12:55.821
Can't be a coincidence that Will
shows up dead a few days later.

12:55.855 --> 12:57.936
No. He's hiding something.

12:58.557 --> 13:00.192
I already told the other cops...

13:00.226 --> 13:01.960
I don't want to give a statement.

13:01.994 --> 13:03.094
Mr. Talmadge,

13:03.129 --> 13:05.363
what's your relationship
to William Fairwick?

13:05.397 --> 13:07.102
I don't know who that is.

13:10.005 --> 13:12.837
Mr. Talmadge, your reaction says otherwise.

13:12.871 --> 13:14.799
Was he your attacker?

13:15.593 --> 13:17.380
I'm not giving a statement.

13:17.690 --> 13:19.677
Given that Mr. Fairwick was murdered,

13:19.712 --> 13:21.212
you might want to rethink that.

13:21.246 --> 13:22.791
Murdered?

13:23.597 --> 13:25.582
Look, if you're implying that I
had something to do with it...

13:25.616 --> 13:27.885
Well, why else would you
refuse to answer the question?

13:27.919 --> 13:30.420
Because you won't believe me anyway.

13:30.455 --> 13:32.262
It'll sound crazy.

13:32.282 --> 13:35.592
You wouldn't believe
the crazy things we've heard.

13:35.626 --> 13:37.094
Try us.

13:41.723 --> 13:44.458
I'd gotten home early, cracked a beer,

13:44.478 --> 13:46.236
but before I could settle in,

13:46.270 --> 13:49.439
I had this feeling
like I was being watched.

13:49.981 --> 13:51.641
Then out of nowhere,

13:51.676 --> 13:54.944
- something threw me to the ground.
- Wait. Some <i>thing?</i>

13:54.979 --> 13:56.312
You mean him, right?

13:56.347 --> 13:58.794
No. I mean some <i>thing.</i>

13:58.814 --> 14:00.816
Some force.

14:00.851 --> 14:03.353
I could feel it on top of me,
suffocating me,

14:03.387 --> 14:05.721
but... but there was nothing there.

14:06.515 --> 14:09.359
I must've blacked out for a second,
and when I came to,

14:09.393 --> 14:13.228
that guy was standing over me,
screaming, "stop it.

14:13.263 --> 14:15.299
You're killing him. This wasn't the deal."

14:15.319 --> 14:17.666
- And who was he yelling at?
- I don't know.

14:17.701 --> 14:20.089
There wasn't anybody else there.

14:20.436 --> 14:22.583
But I think that guy, he saved my life.

14:22.931 --> 14:26.008
This force, what did it want?

14:27.529 --> 14:31.446
It just seemed like it wanted... me.

14:46.354 --> 14:47.762
Okay. Fine.

14:47.797 --> 14:49.431
I admit it is weird.

14:49.465 --> 14:51.365
But I can tell you this.

14:51.400 --> 14:54.402
Whatever Talmadge saw or didn't see,
it wasn't the devil.

14:54.437 --> 14:57.672
You're right.
Probably one of his minions.

14:57.706 --> 15:00.107
A lowly demon that Will
summoned from Beelzebub

15:00.142 --> 15:02.376
to help him get whatever it
was he wanted from Talmadge.

15:02.411 --> 15:04.578
Demons don't need help
getting past security systems,

15:04.612 --> 15:06.414
and the devil doesn't need to use the door.

15:06.448 --> 15:09.116
I'm gonna take another look
at that security-cam footage

15:09.151 --> 15:10.717
from Will's apartment.

15:15.179 --> 15:17.458
- Where's the DVD?
- What DVD?

15:17.492 --> 15:20.126
I put a DVD of security
footage in this evidence box.

15:20.161 --> 15:21.328
Where is it?

15:21.362 --> 15:23.129
Ain't in there, you didn't put it in there.

15:23.164 --> 15:24.264
The hell I didn't.

15:24.298 --> 15:25.666
Who's been in here the past two hours?

15:25.700 --> 15:27.334
Detective,
no one's been in or out of this room

15:27.368 --> 15:29.685
since you checked that box in this morning.

15:30.181 --> 15:31.769
So, what did it do?

15:32.974 --> 15:35.608
- Just walk out on its own?
- No.

15:35.642 --> 15:37.410
It didn't walk out on its own.

15:37.445 --> 15:38.744
Beckett, you were right.

15:38.779 --> 15:40.046
Killer isn't the devil.

15:40.081 --> 15:41.614
The devil doesn't need
to dispose of evidence.

15:41.648 --> 15:42.615
Clearly.

15:42.649 --> 15:44.017
"Clearly" is the perfect word,

15:44.051 --> 15:47.854
because clearly,
our killer is the invisible man.

15:56.587 --> 15:57.954
You collapsed the foam.

15:57.988 --> 15:59.489
So, I called Will's place

15:59.523 --> 16:01.941
to pull security-cam footage
from the hallway again,

16:01.961 --> 16:04.294
and all the files have been erased.

16:04.328 --> 16:07.630
The doorman swears that no one
has been in the security room

16:07.664 --> 16:09.524
since NYPD left the crime scene.

16:09.544 --> 16:12.001
No one or someone he couldn't see?

16:12.035 --> 16:14.003
Beckett, it fits all the facts.

16:14.037 --> 16:16.372
The attack on Talmadge by an unseen force,

16:16.406 --> 16:17.573
the missing evidence,

16:17.607 --> 16:19.942
the haunted cue ball, even Will's murder.

16:19.962 --> 16:20.965
Castle, stop.

16:20.985 --> 16:22.778
There is no such thing
as the invisible man.

16:22.812 --> 16:25.154
But something is going on,
and Will is at the center of it.

16:25.174 --> 16:26.693
- Hey, Espo.
- Yo.

16:26.713 --> 16:29.043
What else have we found on Will Fairwick?

16:29.063 --> 16:30.937
Well,
Ryan's still trying to get in touch

16:30.957 --> 16:32.688
with his employer, Greenblatt Insurance,

16:32.722 --> 16:34.523
and Tory's in there trying
to crack his electronics.

16:34.557 --> 16:37.326
Apparently, Will had some heavy
encryption on his hardware.

16:37.360 --> 16:40.365
That seems a little unnecessary
for someone in the insurance industry.

16:40.385 --> 16:42.864
Yeah, but I just got his phone records

16:42.899 --> 16:44.166
from his wireless carrier,

16:44.200 --> 16:47.411
and dude didn't talk much
except to this one number right here.

16:47.431 --> 16:50.004
He traded dozens of calls with
it over the past six weeks,

16:50.024 --> 16:51.807
and he didn't ever call it before then.

16:51.841 --> 16:53.341
Looks like they spoke nearly every day.

16:53.375 --> 16:56.856
- Who owns that number?
- It's registered to a Ms. Donna Brooks.

16:56.876 --> 16:59.780
Says here that she's a marine
biology professor at Hudson U.

16:59.815 --> 17:03.117
What's he doing
talking to a biology professor?

17:04.001 --> 17:06.607
I hadn't heard from him in a few days.

17:06.627 --> 17:09.557
I was worried,
but I never imagined this.

17:09.944 --> 17:11.980
I can't believe he's dead.

17:12.000 --> 17:16.281
Donna, I know this is hard,
but how do you know Will?

17:16.631 --> 17:20.101
Um, I guess you could say we were dating.

17:20.135 --> 17:23.204
He reached out on Facebook
a couple months ago.

17:23.238 --> 17:27.263
I hadn't seen him since we
first dated back at M.I.T.

17:27.983 --> 17:30.777
An anarchist pool shark attended M.I.T.?

17:31.359 --> 17:33.672
He was always a rebel,

17:33.692 --> 17:35.646
and the smartest student in our class.

17:35.666 --> 17:37.484
Why did he get back in touch?

17:37.518 --> 17:39.819
Will dropped out after only a semester.

17:40.300 --> 17:42.589
So he wanted to talk about
finishing his degree,

17:42.624 --> 17:44.606
enrolling here at Hudson.

17:44.929 --> 17:46.392
It was crazy after all that time,

17:46.426 --> 17:48.628
the spark was still there between us.

17:52.532 --> 17:54.100
Excuse me.

17:54.135 --> 17:55.501
Cuttlefish don't like that.

17:55.535 --> 17:56.770
Right.

17:57.190 --> 17:59.806
Did he ever mention the name Tom Talmadge?

17:59.840 --> 18:01.507
Uh, no. Not that I remember.

18:01.541 --> 18:03.309
And was there anything out of the ordinary

18:03.343 --> 18:04.477
going on in Will's life?

18:04.511 --> 18:07.413
Like way, way, way out of the ordinary.

18:07.447 --> 18:09.649
Yeah. There was.

18:09.683 --> 18:12.050
Will started acting paranoid last week.

18:12.085 --> 18:13.218
We went to dinner,

18:13.253 --> 18:15.988
and he would only take
a table facing the door.

18:16.022 --> 18:18.456
He said he thought he was being watched.

18:18.491 --> 18:19.825
By who?

18:19.859 --> 18:21.293
He would only say by "them."

18:21.327 --> 18:22.995
I thought he was imagining it.

18:23.029 --> 18:26.145
I told him he needed to get help
so it didn't become M.I.T. all over again.

18:26.165 --> 18:27.866
What happened at M.I.T.?

18:28.451 --> 18:31.369
Freshman year, Will had a breakdown.

18:31.404 --> 18:33.538
He cracked under the pressure.

18:33.572 --> 18:35.840
That's why he left.

18:35.874 --> 18:37.776
But if somebody killed him,

18:37.810 --> 18:40.312
then maybe he was being followed.

18:40.346 --> 18:41.579
Okay, here's a theory.

18:41.614 --> 18:42.980
What if Will had another breakdown?

18:43.015 --> 18:45.216
What if he imagined that
the devil was after him,

18:45.250 --> 18:47.952
and in his delusional state,
he smashed up his apartment

18:47.986 --> 18:49.086
and impaled himself?

18:49.121 --> 18:51.726
I mean,
we've seen guys on pcp do much worse.

18:51.746 --> 18:54.025
Well, that still doesn't
explain the attack on Talmadge,

18:54.059 --> 18:56.861
the magical pool shot,
or all the disappearing evidence.

18:56.895 --> 18:58.963
No, something much bigger is going on here.

18:58.997 --> 19:00.464
You know, I think Castle may be right.

19:00.498 --> 19:01.999
I finally got in touch
with Greenblatt Insurance.

19:02.034 --> 19:04.302
They say he is on the payroll,
but as a remote employee.

19:04.336 --> 19:06.137
Greenblatt's only office is in Chicago,

19:06.171 --> 19:07.471
and Will's never been there.

19:07.505 --> 19:09.473
But his neighbor said he saw
him go into work every day.

19:09.507 --> 19:11.208
Yep, and his Greenblatt key card

19:11.242 --> 19:13.143
was with his house keys
and all scratched up, worn.

19:13.177 --> 19:15.045
So, if Greenblatt doesn't
have a New York office,

19:15.079 --> 19:16.347
where was Will going every day?

19:16.381 --> 19:18.716
Sounds like Greenblatt
Insurance is a front.

19:18.750 --> 19:20.517
Ryan, where is this key card now?

19:20.552 --> 19:22.312
Back at Will's apartment.

19:27.673 --> 19:29.326
What are you doing?

19:29.360 --> 19:32.195
We don't know if the invisible
man is here right now.

19:40.704 --> 19:41.904
Oh!

19:41.938 --> 19:43.673
Did the invisible man just goose you?

19:43.707 --> 19:45.074
- Castle.
- I know.

19:45.108 --> 19:46.876
They're like that. So gauche.

19:49.745 --> 19:51.013
Right.

19:55.853 --> 19:57.753
Ooh. That's pretty good.

19:57.787 --> 19:59.788
You're really selling the invisible...

20:02.192 --> 20:03.926
This is... this is real!

20:03.960 --> 20:05.794
This is...

20:07.663 --> 20:10.299
I touched it.
Whatever it was, I touched it!

20:13.469 --> 20:15.203
Castle!

20:15.237 --> 20:16.538
He's going after the key card!

20:18.574 --> 20:21.142
Ow! Ow! Ow!

20:24.316 --> 20:26.147
Are you okay?

20:28.846 --> 20:30.757
What was that?

20:30.777 --> 20:32.320
That was him.

20:32.788 --> 20:36.324
The invisible man is real!

20:36.773 --> 20:37.558
Yeah.

20:37.593 --> 20:43.131
Well, whatever it...
That... whatever it was,

20:43.623 --> 20:46.532
it just ran off
with the only lead we have.

20:46.552 --> 20:47.681
No.

20:47.817 --> 20:49.356
It ran off with my credit card.

20:49.517 --> 20:52.272
I managed to hang on to the key card.

20:53.342 --> 20:55.712
You don't think
he's still here, do you?

21:03.584 --> 21:06.999
You were attacked at a closed crime scene?
By whom?

21:07.019 --> 21:09.285
We didn't get a good look
at the assailant, sir.

21:09.305 --> 21:10.893
Actually, we...

21:12.655 --> 21:14.058
Yes, Mr. Castle?

21:14.092 --> 21:17.194
It was dark and we didn't see anything.

21:17.228 --> 21:19.063
Do you know why this person was there?

21:19.097 --> 21:20.990
We believe they were after
the victim's key card.

21:21.010 --> 21:24.551
Why? Were they trying to gain
access to some part of Will's life?

21:24.571 --> 21:25.971
Or maybe they were covering their tracks

21:25.991 --> 21:28.205
and don't want us to know
what door that card opens.

21:28.240 --> 21:30.015
I've got CSU reprocessing the crime scene.

21:30.035 --> 21:32.041
They're looking for new prints,

21:32.076 --> 21:34.210
and Tory's gonna try to match the key card

21:34.245 --> 21:35.779
to, um, to security systems.

21:35.813 --> 21:37.618
She's gonna start that
first thing in the morning.

21:37.638 --> 21:39.783
All right. Um, keep me posted.

21:46.553 --> 21:48.925
Is there something you're not telling me?

21:51.705 --> 21:53.442
No, sir.

21:56.632 --> 21:58.254
Detective Beckett.

21:58.274 --> 22:00.575
Lying to your superior?

22:00.595 --> 22:03.173
I told her the truth.
I don't know what attacked us.

22:03.207 --> 22:04.873
That was not a lie.

22:04.908 --> 22:06.676
Omission is the invisible lie.

22:06.710 --> 22:08.177
Castle,
you can't tell me that what happened

22:08.211 --> 22:10.045
didn't freak you out just a little bit.

22:10.079 --> 22:12.181
- I mean, what the hell was that thing?
- I don't know.

22:12.215 --> 22:15.584
But I do know a way to
take our minds off it

22:15.619 --> 22:18.153
for a while if you're, uh...

22:18.188 --> 22:20.211
interested?

22:34.796 --> 22:37.787
You have no idea how much I missed this.

22:39.338 --> 22:40.908
You had amnesia for two months.

22:40.943 --> 22:41.976
I missed it more.

22:49.436 --> 22:50.705
Did you hear that?

22:50.725 --> 22:52.754
- Very funny, Castle.
- Mm.

22:54.088 --> 22:55.689
I'm serious.

22:57.427 --> 23:00.335
- No, I just hear the music.
- Okay.

23:01.529 --> 23:04.201
Mm!
Is that your hand on my leg?

23:04.221 --> 23:06.633
Uh... Yeah.

23:06.668 --> 23:07.969
- Yeah. Pretty sure.
- Okay.

23:08.003 --> 23:09.954
Okay.

23:10.372 --> 23:11.372
What's wrong?

23:11.406 --> 23:12.939
I just... I feel like we're being watched.

23:16.834 --> 23:18.412
Pretty sure we're not being watched.

23:18.446 --> 23:20.347
I know,
but maybe this isn't such a good idea.

23:20.382 --> 23:22.048
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

23:22.083 --> 23:23.183
Whoa.

23:24.035 --> 23:25.853
Just wait here.

23:25.887 --> 23:27.254
Okay.

23:39.755 --> 23:42.335
And you thought zombie
apocalypse survival camp

23:42.370 --> 23:44.637
was a waste of time.

23:47.924 --> 23:49.809
Good. Okay.

23:52.714 --> 23:54.217
What?

23:54.688 --> 23:57.417
You just kind of make nerdy sexy.

23:57.451 --> 23:59.051
That's true.

23:59.085 --> 24:00.752
- Where were we?
- Yeah.

24:05.436 --> 24:06.926
Aah!

24:11.777 --> 24:13.172
- Mother.
- Oh.

24:13.192 --> 24:13.966
Martha?

24:14.000 --> 24:15.067
I'm so sorry.

24:15.101 --> 24:16.334
I didn't know you guys were home.

24:16.368 --> 24:18.503
I just wanted a little dental floss,

24:18.538 --> 24:20.772
and it looks like I found it.

24:20.807 --> 24:23.575
Oh, my lord.

24:29.384 --> 24:32.183
So, CSU reprocessed that crime scene.

24:32.217 --> 24:34.485
No new fingerprints, which means...

24:34.519 --> 24:36.120
Come on. The invisible man?

24:36.155 --> 24:37.822
I'm just saying,
even Beckett seemed freaked out last night.

24:37.856 --> 24:39.023
Mm.

24:39.058 --> 24:41.892
It would be cool,
the power of invisibility.

24:41.927 --> 24:44.963
I would so sneak into area 51. You?

24:44.997 --> 24:47.698
Super bowl, 50-yard line.

24:47.732 --> 24:49.099
Best seat in the hou...

24:49.133 --> 24:51.071
Hey, what's that on your neck?

24:52.136 --> 24:54.570
Is that... is that body glitter?

24:56.059 --> 24:57.423
Is that a scratch?

24:57.443 --> 24:59.477
No, it's nothing.

25:00.062 --> 25:01.849
Married women don't wear body glitter.

25:02.159 --> 25:03.616
What's going on?

25:03.636 --> 25:04.715
You stepping out on Jenny?

25:04.749 --> 25:06.749
Wait. What? N-no.

25:06.784 --> 25:08.151
She's the mother of your kid.

25:08.186 --> 25:09.419
I am doing this for my kid.

25:09.454 --> 25:10.887
Oh, come on.

25:10.921 --> 25:12.922
Do you realize how much it's gonna cost

25:12.957 --> 25:14.591
to send Sarah grace to college?

25:14.625 --> 25:17.427
A quarter of a million dollars.
That's for a state school.

25:17.462 --> 25:20.552
Well, I'm...
I've got a second job working nights.

25:21.483 --> 25:22.828
Doing what?

25:22.848 --> 25:24.667
Bouncing at a club.

25:24.702 --> 25:26.503
Where they use body glitter?

25:28.638 --> 25:29.772
A gentleman's club.

25:29.807 --> 25:32.241
Is it bottom's up? Pole position?

25:32.275 --> 25:34.243
No, no, no. Landing strip.

25:34.277 --> 25:36.245
- Men-hattan.
- What?

25:37.796 --> 25:39.415
Men-hattan.

25:39.449 --> 25:40.682
Men-hattan?

25:41.723 --> 25:45.210
You got a job protecting male strippers?

25:45.632 --> 25:47.573
Oh, my God.

25:47.593 --> 25:48.790
Hey.

25:48.825 --> 25:49.825
It's no joke.

25:49.859 --> 25:51.560
It's more dangerous than this job.

25:51.594 --> 25:55.041
Those women, they rush the stage
like these are the last men on the planet.

25:55.061 --> 25:57.533
I have bruises that I can't explain.

25:57.567 --> 25:59.001
Ladies be crazy, Javi.

25:59.035 --> 26:02.578
The card's rfid architecture
is like nothing I've ever seen.

26:02.598 --> 26:04.907
Yeah, but there's got to be something else
that you can tell us about it.

26:04.941 --> 26:07.075
I can tell you this...
it's not commercially manufactured.

26:07.109 --> 26:08.977
Well, how did anarchy boy get it, then?

26:09.012 --> 26:11.046
I don't know,
and I'm afraid there's no way to find out.

26:11.080 --> 26:12.680
This thing was designed to be untraceable.

26:12.714 --> 26:15.883
Maybe the card was, but this wasn't.

26:15.918 --> 26:20.688
Proudly made in the U.S.A.
by advantus apparel.

26:22.066 --> 26:25.026
So, wait,
I'm sponsoring the precinct softball team?

26:25.061 --> 26:27.828
Yeah, it was the only way that
I could get advantus apparel

26:27.863 --> 26:29.630
to share their client list with us.

26:29.665 --> 26:32.433
Now, they said that they
shipped the Greenblatt order

26:32.467 --> 26:35.469
to this office four years ago.

26:35.503 --> 26:38.039
What is this place?

26:38.073 --> 26:40.641
I don't know.

26:40.676 --> 26:42.509
This whole floor is unlisted.

26:42.544 --> 26:44.545
I think it's a secret laboratory

26:44.579 --> 26:47.586
where they're injecting human guinea pigs
with invisibility serum.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.299
Well, whatever it is,

26:49.319 --> 26:51.351
the killer definitely
didn't want us to find it.

26:55.756 --> 26:57.257
Oh, hello, there.

26:57.292 --> 27:00.094
I'm betting this isn't
Greenblatt Insurance.

27:00.128 --> 27:01.360
Hi. I'm detective Beckett, NYPD.

27:01.395 --> 27:03.463
We were wondering if a William Fairwick

27:03.497 --> 27:04.564
is an employee here.

27:04.599 --> 27:06.332
Let me get someone to assist you.

27:06.366 --> 27:08.568
What kind of business is this, exactly?

27:08.603 --> 27:10.403
It'll be just a moment.

27:10.437 --> 27:12.307
I love that jacket.

27:15.634 --> 27:18.364
Hands! Show me your hands!

27:27.400 --> 27:28.990
Your credentials check out.

27:29.010 --> 27:31.136
If you and Mr. Castle vacate
the premises immediately,

27:31.170 --> 27:33.139
we'll refrain from filing
federal trespassing charges.

27:33.159 --> 27:35.007
I'm sorry, we're investigating a homicide.

27:35.041 --> 27:36.683
We're not leaving without answers.

27:36.703 --> 27:39.364
Uh, federal charges?

27:39.785 --> 27:42.014
It's a top-secret government facility.

27:42.048 --> 27:43.848
I was right. Invisibility serum.

27:43.882 --> 27:45.484
What did you say?

27:45.518 --> 27:46.985
I said I was right.

27:50.189 --> 27:52.055
Copy that, ma'am.

28:02.630 --> 28:04.769
Hello. I'm Dr. Elena Sarkov.

28:04.789 --> 28:07.138
What did you mean by invisibility serum?

28:07.172 --> 28:09.907
- I was just saying that...
- Castle.

28:10.279 --> 28:13.344
If you want answers,
you're gonna have to give us some first.

28:13.378 --> 28:17.079
Unless you want the entire NYPD
knocking on your front door.

28:18.535 --> 28:20.184
What do you want to know?

28:20.218 --> 28:24.442
What is this place and how is
Will Fairwick connected to it?

28:25.150 --> 28:26.790
Mr. Castle is correct.

28:26.824 --> 28:28.392
This is a government facility.

28:28.426 --> 28:30.661
CIA? Homeland security.

28:30.695 --> 28:32.835
Ah-ah! D.A.R.P.A.?

28:32.855 --> 28:34.031
Something like that.

28:34.065 --> 28:35.875
Will worked here,

28:35.895 --> 28:38.365
and his death was quite a loss to us.

28:38.724 --> 28:40.037
So, you know about his murder.

28:40.071 --> 28:41.337
What did he do here?

28:41.372 --> 28:43.273
He was one of my scientists.

28:43.307 --> 28:45.942
Quantum engineering.
I recruited him out of M.I.T.

28:45.977 --> 28:47.044
Recruited?

28:47.078 --> 28:49.011
Wait, so then he never had a breakdown.

28:49.046 --> 28:50.880
Cover story to avoid questions.

28:50.914 --> 28:53.216
Quantum engineering? D.A.R.P.A.?

28:53.250 --> 28:55.618
You <i>are</i> researching invisibility.

28:55.653 --> 28:59.225
No, Mr. Castle.
Invisibility is science fiction.

28:59.809 --> 29:03.259
Cloaking, however, is science.

29:03.473 --> 29:07.096
I have answered your questions.
Now answer mine.

29:07.742 --> 29:10.459
How did you find out about our technology?

29:10.621 --> 29:11.834
During our investigation,

29:11.868 --> 29:14.303
we encountered an unseen person...

29:14.337 --> 29:16.431
- Invisible person.
- at Will's apartment.

29:16.451 --> 29:19.474
We believe this whoever
was behind his murder,

29:19.509 --> 29:21.943
and given the research
that you're doing here,

29:21.977 --> 29:23.912
we believe the killer is
connected to this facility.

29:23.946 --> 29:25.146
That's impossible.

29:25.181 --> 29:27.449
- We know what we saw.
- Or didn't see.

29:27.483 --> 29:28.783
No, it's impossible

29:28.818 --> 29:32.020
because we haven't gotten
our technology to work.

29:33.590 --> 29:35.056
But I think I know who did.

29:35.091 --> 29:36.458
The Chinese?

29:36.492 --> 29:38.559
They've been pursuing the same technology.

29:38.594 --> 29:40.695
We heard they were close to a breakthrough.

29:40.730 --> 29:42.163
Why would you suspect them?

29:42.198 --> 29:43.598
Because a few days ago,

29:43.632 --> 29:45.967
we suffered a crippling cyber attack.

29:46.001 --> 29:47.969
All of our data was wiped out.

29:48.003 --> 29:50.205
Our team managed to trace the virus

29:50.239 --> 29:52.273
to a relay station in Shanghai.

29:52.307 --> 29:54.475
It's a suit.

29:54.509 --> 29:56.310
How does it turn invisible?

29:56.345 --> 29:59.647
By bending light waves over meta materials.

30:02.191 --> 30:04.352
You guys have the coolest toys.

30:04.386 --> 30:07.087
It's what I promised Will to lure him here.

30:07.122 --> 30:10.391
The opportunity to play
with advanced government tech.

30:10.425 --> 30:12.292
Of course, as an anarchist,

30:12.326 --> 30:14.962
he joked it was his deal with the devil.

30:14.996 --> 30:17.397
If you're right and the
Chinese do have a working suit,

30:17.431 --> 30:18.598
why would they target Will?

30:18.633 --> 30:22.093
Technology is the arms
race of the 21st century.

30:22.113 --> 30:24.138
And Will was the key to our research.

30:24.172 --> 30:27.674
His death... sets us back years.

30:29.863 --> 30:32.816
- Excuse me for just one moment.
- Yeah.

30:36.417 --> 30:37.651
Castle.

30:37.685 --> 30:39.519
If the Chinese are behind this,

30:39.553 --> 30:42.656
why would they try to stop us
from taking Will's key card,

30:42.690 --> 30:45.024
and what do they have to do with Talmadge?

30:45.058 --> 30:47.276
- I don't think it's the Chinese.
- Why not?

30:47.296 --> 30:50.696
Do you see that symbol there that... there.

30:50.730 --> 30:53.699
It keeps repeating in the virus
the one that isn't Chinese.

30:53.733 --> 30:55.534
- Mm-hmm.
- It's a symbol

30:55.568 --> 30:59.770
of the east mountain goblins from
"Terra Quest."

31:00.539 --> 31:02.308
Will's neighbor.

31:02.342 --> 31:04.410
Henry Wright.

31:04.444 --> 31:06.011
Unis went to Henry Wright's apartment,

31:06.045 --> 31:07.946
found it cleaned out...
closet and dresser emptied.

31:07.980 --> 31:08.947
Dude's gone.

31:08.981 --> 31:10.148
What have we found on him?

31:10.183 --> 31:11.617
Well, he's a serious hacker.

31:11.651 --> 31:14.353
At 15, he cracked the city's power grid.

31:14.387 --> 31:16.888
Didn't get scared straight
until he was in his 20s.

31:16.923 --> 31:18.223
Now he's a sneaker,

31:18.257 --> 31:20.591
testing cyber defenses
for fortune 500 companies.

31:20.626 --> 31:22.117
Which means he had the skills necessary

31:22.137 --> 31:24.388
to launch a cyber attack
against Dr. Sarkov's lab.

31:24.408 --> 31:26.431
And, uh,
he had another connection to this case.

31:26.465 --> 31:28.967
Henry attended caltech with...
wait for it...

31:29.001 --> 31:30.135
assault victim Tom Talmadge.

31:30.169 --> 31:31.436
They were roommates.

31:31.470 --> 31:34.977
This is the lawsuit that
Henry filed against Talmadge,

31:34.997 --> 31:38.376
accusing him of stealing the code
that he used to build Hytch.

31:38.410 --> 31:41.912
- The court dismissed the case.
- Costing Henry billions.

31:41.947 --> 31:45.350
Sarkov said her lab hadn't
cracked the cloaking technology,

31:45.384 --> 31:46.784
but what if Will did

31:46.819 --> 31:48.760
with a little help from his neighbor,
Henry?

31:48.780 --> 31:51.779
And with a functioning suit,
Henry could've enlisted Will's help

31:51.799 --> 31:53.392
to get revenge against Talmadge.

31:53.412 --> 31:56.126
But Henry still needed help
defeating Talmadge's home security.

31:56.161 --> 31:58.963
Invisibility doesn't defeat
thermal or pressure systems.

31:58.997 --> 32:00.464
So, they hustled Jiggy

32:00.498 --> 32:02.933
while Henry was wearing
that invisibility suit.

32:02.968 --> 32:05.402
Henry is the one that was moving
the cue ball around the table.

32:05.436 --> 32:07.203
And perhaps once Henry
realized the power of the suit,

32:07.238 --> 32:08.828
he set his sights on Will,

32:08.848 --> 32:11.541
making sure that power
would never be taken away.

32:11.576 --> 32:12.743
Okay, how do we find this kid?

32:12.777 --> 32:14.678
We don't. The guy's a high-level hacker.

32:14.712 --> 32:16.646
He's got a new I.D. And he's
out of the country by now.

32:16.681 --> 32:18.382
He'll trade on his skills
and live like a king.

32:18.416 --> 32:21.685
Actually, he's already living like a king,

32:21.719 --> 32:24.620
and that's how we're gonna find him.

32:24.654 --> 32:28.457
<i>Welcome to "Terra Quest." Adventure awaits.</i>

32:30.865 --> 32:32.461
All right.

32:32.496 --> 32:35.064
East mountain goblin army is attacking

32:35.099 --> 32:36.699
from the base of Mt. Orr,

32:36.733 --> 32:40.578
which means their king Will
be leading them into battle.

32:41.708 --> 32:43.238
There he is.

32:43.273 --> 32:44.860
That's Henry.

32:44.880 --> 32:47.743
Ooh! Where did he get a falchion sword?

32:47.778 --> 32:49.344
That's like plus-90 conquest points.

32:49.379 --> 32:50.679
Can you get a lock on that avatar

32:50.714 --> 32:52.314
and see if you can trace the
location where Henry logged in?

32:52.348 --> 32:54.182
I think so.

32:54.217 --> 32:56.051
And I Will join the battle...

32:57.420 --> 32:59.124
And slow him down.

33:08.984 --> 33:12.534
I thought underground gaming
dens were just legend.

33:12.568 --> 33:15.580
Yeah, well, I thought
the invisible man wasn't real.

33:15.600 --> 33:17.065
There he is.

33:18.120 --> 33:18.940
Henry!

33:18.974 --> 33:20.875
Stop! Stop!

33:20.910 --> 33:22.410
Stop him!

33:22.445 --> 33:24.278
Stop!

33:30.018 --> 33:32.253
Who's got the falchion sword now?

33:37.242 --> 33:40.324
I didn't murder Will. He was my friend.

33:40.344 --> 33:42.335
Then why did you run, Henry?

33:48.648 --> 33:51.142
Look,
we know that you went after Tom Talmadge.

33:51.162 --> 33:52.681
You were behind a cyber attack

33:52.701 --> 33:55.101
that brought down a government lab,

33:55.121 --> 33:58.363
and then you cleaned out your
apartment and you disappeared.

33:58.383 --> 34:00.929
Because I was afraid that
they would come after me next.

34:01.701 --> 34:02.562
Who?

34:02.582 --> 34:04.432
The same people that killed Will.

34:04.467 --> 34:07.769
All right, if they found out that I knew...

34:07.803 --> 34:09.603
That you knew what?

34:11.005 --> 34:12.639
You helped him, didn't you?

34:12.675 --> 34:14.542
You helped him build a working suit.

34:14.577 --> 34:18.312
Will came to me with an out-there idea.

34:19.134 --> 34:23.851
He wanted to adopt nature's camouflage
to meta materials.

34:23.886 --> 34:25.319
But there wasn't anybody in his lab

34:25.353 --> 34:28.324
that had my program skills,
and since there was no way

34:28.344 --> 34:30.291
I was gonna get security clearance,

34:30.324 --> 34:32.193
we worked on the down low.

34:32.226 --> 34:33.694
And in exchange, you got to use his suit

34:33.728 --> 34:35.362
to exact your revenge
against Talmadge, right?

34:35.397 --> 34:37.264
That wasn't supposed to happen.

34:37.998 --> 34:39.065
I was just looking for proof

34:39.101 --> 34:41.067
that Tom stole my idea for Hytch.

34:41.101 --> 34:42.735
Yeah, well, his broken ribs say otherwise.

34:42.755 --> 34:45.839
I couldn't find what I needed.

34:46.373 --> 34:49.306
And then Tom came home early.

34:49.952 --> 34:53.452
I-I just wanted to mess with him.

34:55.152 --> 34:57.423
But I snapped.

34:59.644 --> 35:02.755
Will heard the struggle,
he came in, and he pulled me off.

35:03.200 --> 35:06.592
You got angry with Will for stopping you.

35:06.627 --> 35:09.362
So, you decided to use his suit
to kill him instead, right?

35:09.397 --> 35:10.430
No!

35:10.464 --> 35:13.198
We both realized that I had become Frodo,

35:13.233 --> 35:16.936
and the suit was the one
ring to rule them all!

35:16.970 --> 35:19.238
Will knew it was too much
power for anyone to have,

35:19.272 --> 35:21.122
especially the government.

35:22.868 --> 35:25.548
So, that was Will's Oppenheimer moment.

35:25.796 --> 35:27.279
The suit became the atomic bomb.

35:27.314 --> 35:29.148
All right, it needed to be destroyed.

35:29.182 --> 35:31.283
Cast into the fires of Mordor.

35:31.318 --> 35:34.036
We sabotaged the lab so that
they couldn't rebuild the tech,

35:34.056 --> 35:36.288
at least not right away.

35:36.729 --> 35:38.490
And without the quantum cellular equations

35:38.524 --> 35:40.626
Will derived from Cephalopods,

35:40.787 --> 35:43.963
- they may never be able to.
- Cephalopods? Like squids?

35:43.997 --> 35:46.142
Actually, um, Will,

35:46.162 --> 35:49.455
he based his equations
off of the cuttlefish.

35:53.540 --> 35:56.908
<i>The cuttlefish is known
as nature's king of camouflage.</i>

35:56.943 --> 35:58.309
And listen to this.

35:58.344 --> 36:00.779
"The papillae of the cuttlefish
are unique in their ability

36:00.813 --> 36:03.081
"to rapidly polarize reflected light waves

36:03.115 --> 36:04.682
and change the creature's skin color."

36:04.716 --> 36:06.650
That's why Will got back
in touch with Donna.

36:06.685 --> 36:09.363
He didn't want her. He wanted her research.

36:09.383 --> 36:12.923
Castle, look at Will's phone records.

36:12.958 --> 36:15.093
For weeks, there were phone calls

36:15.127 --> 36:17.195
going back and forth
between the two of them,

36:17.229 --> 36:20.582
and then three days before his death,

36:20.602 --> 36:22.816
right when he got that suit to function,

36:22.836 --> 36:25.031
there were only incoming calls from her.

36:25.051 --> 36:26.036
Will wasn't answering.

36:26.070 --> 36:29.373
And right after Will was murdered,
she stops calling,

36:29.407 --> 36:31.447
almost as if she knew he was dead.

36:31.467 --> 36:33.544
Hey, guys. I called the university.

36:33.578 --> 36:36.310
Guess who canceled their class
the night Will was killed.

36:41.585 --> 36:42.952
What's going on here?

36:42.987 --> 36:44.854
This is a private office.

36:44.889 --> 36:46.156
Which belongs to the university.

36:46.190 --> 36:47.690
The Dean gave us permission to search it

36:47.725 --> 36:49.359
as a part of our investigation.

36:49.394 --> 36:52.228
Wait. You think I had something
to do with Will's death?

36:52.262 --> 36:54.296
Donna, you missed your class
the night that he was killed.

36:54.331 --> 36:55.297
Where were you?

36:55.332 --> 36:57.497
At home with a cold.

36:57.517 --> 36:59.869
I never would've hurt Will. I loved him.

36:59.904 --> 37:02.572
You loved him, but then he betrayed you.

37:02.606 --> 37:05.041
That must have made you angry to find out

37:05.075 --> 37:07.677
that he was just using
you for your research.

37:07.711 --> 37:09.512
That's not true.

37:09.546 --> 37:11.480
That was the second time that he left you,

37:11.515 --> 37:12.748
and you couldn't live
with the embarrassment.

37:12.782 --> 37:14.983
This is ridiculous.
I'm not gonna stand here

37:15.018 --> 37:16.852
and let you accuse me
of killing my boyfriend.

37:16.886 --> 37:19.422
Donna, that was you in the
suit in the apartment with us.

37:19.456 --> 37:22.525
That's the same suit that
you used to kill Will.

37:22.559 --> 37:24.560
You found out about his project,

37:24.594 --> 37:26.528
and before he could destroy it,

37:26.563 --> 37:28.630
you used his own creation against him.

37:28.665 --> 37:30.732
What suit?
What are you talking about?

37:30.767 --> 37:33.334
The suit you wore when you
went after Will's key card

37:33.369 --> 37:35.203
and you got my credit card instead.

37:35.237 --> 37:37.673
Just found it buried in
the back of your drawer.

37:37.707 --> 37:39.174
Thank you for that, by the way.
I forgot to cancel this.

37:39.208 --> 37:40.475
That can be such a pain.

37:40.509 --> 37:44.331
What was I supposed to do,
let him get away with it?

37:44.617 --> 37:48.475
He stopped calling, stopped texting.

37:48.495 --> 37:50.552
He used me!

37:50.586 --> 37:53.543
And then pretended like I didn't exist.

37:53.563 --> 37:56.901
He wanted me to just
disappear from his life.

37:58.523 --> 38:00.235
So I did.

38:01.017 --> 38:03.130
And he never saw me coming.

38:05.075 --> 38:07.532
Donna Brooks, you're under arrest...

38:12.507 --> 38:14.224
- You go.
- Okay. Okay.

38:14.509 --> 38:16.143
Okay, I'll get this.

38:23.804 --> 38:25.752
Her backpack and clothes.

38:25.786 --> 38:26.820
She's wearing the suit.

38:26.854 --> 38:27.954
Castle, block the door.

38:27.989 --> 38:29.656
Right.

38:31.646 --> 38:33.879
She is not slipping past this time.

38:37.498 --> 38:40.084
Donna, there's nowhere to go.

39:14.500 --> 39:16.035
Yeah, gotcha now!

39:18.337 --> 39:20.872
I so missed these mind melds.

39:30.583 --> 39:31.616
2:00!

39:35.087 --> 39:36.655
She's right there.

39:54.906 --> 39:57.341
Beckett,
what would you do if you were invisible?

39:57.375 --> 40:00.077
I'd walk out of here without
having to file this report.

40:00.111 --> 40:02.045
- Mm.
- Boring.

40:02.080 --> 40:04.248
- Yeah. I know.
- How about you, Castle?

40:04.282 --> 40:06.450
Be a fly on the wall,
see what Beckett's dad really thinks of me.

40:06.484 --> 40:07.484
Hmm.

40:09.884 --> 40:10.721
Hmm.

40:10.755 --> 40:12.279
What's this?

40:15.190 --> 40:17.527
"Time you had a proper uniform.

40:17.561 --> 40:19.462
Love, Javi."

40:19.496 --> 40:21.264
It's from the heart, bro.

40:21.298 --> 40:22.966
Okay.

40:27.006 --> 40:28.289
Too big?

40:28.309 --> 40:29.272
Want to help me try it on?

40:29.306 --> 40:30.740
Ew. They told me it was new.

40:30.774 --> 40:33.142
I could really use your help.
What? Blue is my color.

40:33.176 --> 40:35.111
What's wrong with you?

40:36.614 --> 40:38.926
You don't have to be embarrassed.

40:40.515 --> 40:43.630
We'll be taking custody of that,
Mr. Castle.

40:45.752 --> 40:48.557
You know,
Will thought this was too much power

40:48.591 --> 40:50.159
for any one person to have,

40:50.193 --> 40:52.013
and after everything that's happened,

40:52.033 --> 40:53.896
I think I agree.

40:53.930 --> 40:56.766
This kind of science is a
bit of a deal with the devil.

40:57.260 --> 40:59.817
Be careful not to lose your soul.

41:10.785 --> 41:13.639
Mother is out for the evening.

41:13.659 --> 41:18.119
Alexis is pulling
an all-nighter at the library.

41:18.154 --> 41:21.028
So, we're actually, truly really alone?

41:21.048 --> 41:24.051
This came in this morning.

41:25.776 --> 41:27.162
Switching to thermal.

41:30.833 --> 41:32.233
Scanning the room.

41:36.715 --> 41:37.705
The room is clear,

41:37.739 --> 41:41.409
all except for the very
hot object before me.

41:41.443 --> 41:43.043
Okay.

41:43.077 --> 41:46.087
Give me a minute and let me slip
into something special, okay?

41:46.211 --> 41:47.563
Right.

41:48.866 --> 41:51.919
'Cause there's something special
I got you for Valentine's day.

41:51.953 --> 41:52.920
I approve.

41:52.954 --> 41:55.122
It's even better.

41:55.486 --> 41:57.157
It's invisible.
