03:28.959 --> 03:30.700
Man and his dreams.

03:31.169 --> 03:36.381
Since the beginning of mankind,
man has been pushing himself

03:36.508 --> 03:41.799
past great limits,
beyond his wildest imagination,

03:42.305 --> 03:47.050
to find himself in a place
that he never thought he'd be.

03:47.477 --> 03:51.972
Physical strength, magnificent speed,
the human spirit.

03:53.233 --> 03:58.149
The human mind
should never be underestimated.

03:58.864 --> 04:01.732
See, some of us are born
to do great things.

04:02.951 --> 04:05.159
To inspire.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.737
To run.

04:07.873 --> 04:10.206
Everyone runs for different reasons,

04:10.333 --> 04:15.545
but no one in the history of humanity
has run as fast as Usain Bolt.

04:16.380 --> 04:19.874
They get away first time,
Tyson Gay right alongside Usain Bolt,

04:20.010 --> 04:22.468
but here he goes, streaking away already.

04:22.596 --> 04:29.685
Let's take a look at the clock.
9.58. New world record!

04:30.729 --> 04:33.767
Away cleanly. Bolt has got
a very good start indeed.

04:33.899 --> 04:37.392
Look at the gap between him
and the rest of the world.

04:37.527 --> 04:40.315
Three meters clear. Five meters clear.
And away he goes.

04:40.447 --> 04:44.066
He continues on his way towards
another gold medal. Watch the clock.

04:44.284 --> 04:49.655
19.19. Bolt destroys his old world record.

04:49.790 --> 04:53.625
He writes his own history
with every stride that he takes.

04:55.921 --> 05:00.461
He has defied what science or normal
people says no one is supposed to do.

05:00.592 --> 05:03.835
For his height they said
he shouldn't be running so fast,

05:03.970 --> 05:07.554
or for where he's from, they're saying
he shouldn't be who he is.

05:07.682 --> 05:10.675
So he represent "don't let everybody
tell you you can't."

05:10.811 --> 05:13.394
"Don't let anybody tell you don't dream."

05:13.522 --> 05:15.605
People love sports throughout the world.

05:15.732 --> 05:18.315
You support one football team
and you hate the other team.

05:18.443 --> 05:21.231
I think with Usain,
everyone loves him everywhere.

05:21.363 --> 05:26.358
He goes beyond boundaries
of race, religion, politics.

05:26.493 --> 05:30.908
Usain Bolt bring rhythm to athletics.
It wasn't there before.

05:31.039 --> 05:34.999
Everybody took it too serious,
maybe because they had to.

05:35.126 --> 05:41.168
He don't have to do that.
Naturally, naturally a champion.

05:41.299 --> 05:45.543
If you've gotten to see him on TV,
consider yourself lucky.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.137
If you've gotten a chance
to see him run live,

05:48.265 --> 05:50.427
consider yourself very, very blessed.

05:52.143 --> 05:55.227
He's dominated.
He's won everything there is to win.

05:55.355 --> 05:58.644
If he goes on
and he's three-times Olympic champion,

05:58.775 --> 06:01.062
I mean, no one can top that.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.813
He'll never be forgotten
because no one's ever done it before,

06:04.948 --> 06:07.156
and for him to just take command

06:07.284 --> 06:12.245
and to be that much better
than everyone else is unbelievable.

06:15.208 --> 06:21.546
He has to believe in himself
and trust God, because he born for this.

06:38.940 --> 06:44.186
Yo. It's my last day in Monaco.

06:44.321 --> 06:47.189
About to get ready
to go to China right now, Beijing.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.200
Iron my shirt.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.613
Once more, one more season.

06:55.749 --> 07:01.165
They say I'm the underdog,
so let's see what happens about that.

07:01.296 --> 07:04.084
Almost done ironing.

07:04.215 --> 07:05.251
Oh, shit.

07:05.383 --> 07:08.922
Should be a little tricky this season.

07:09.054 --> 07:14.140
I haven't been in the best of shape,
but for me that's never an excuse.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.385
I seem to always get injured
throughout the season,

07:17.520 --> 07:21.935
but I always find a way
to get it right, so...

07:24.194 --> 07:28.734
I have all faith in God and my coach
that they will get me ready,

07:28.865 --> 07:32.575
and as long as I'm ready
when I'm on the line,

07:32.702 --> 07:34.159
there's no stopping me.

07:39.417 --> 07:42.160
This is the moment. Are you ready?
I keep asking myself that.

07:45.924 --> 07:48.007
Been a long season.
It's been rough for me.

07:48.134 --> 07:51.718
It's been tough, a few people doubting
me, saying, "You're not gonna do it,"

07:51.846 --> 07:55.681
or "Gatlin's running better,
Gatlin is the best right now."

07:55.809 --> 07:58.347
I think this season,
because Gatlin was running so good,

07:58.478 --> 08:00.344
it was playing on my mind
a little bit more.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.432
Bolt, the holder
of the championship record.

08:04.567 --> 08:07.401
The only blemish was when he false started

08:07.529 --> 08:09.816
in the final in Daegu four years ago.

08:16.204 --> 08:21.450
Usain is in the first semi, so we expect
him to execute and get into the finals.

08:21.584 --> 08:23.792
The gun went.

08:23.920 --> 08:29.166
And I remember the young kid
which was near me got a flying start.

08:30.552 --> 08:33.794
This kind of threw me off a little bit,
so I stumbled.

08:35.306 --> 08:36.638
I was like, "Yo, shit."

08:36.765 --> 08:38.097
He's stumbled.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.467
I looked up and I panicked.

08:39.602 --> 08:42.845
I need to get back in this race
as quickly as possible.

08:42.981 --> 08:45.519
Usain Bolt has got
an awful lot of work to do.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.562
China is there.
Is he gonna make the top two?

08:47.694 --> 08:50.732
He has a look,
and just, just, just does it.

08:52.282 --> 08:55.070
Ran through the line,
all I could think is, like,

08:55.201 --> 08:58.410
"Dear God, please
don't let this happen in the final."

08:58.538 --> 09:02.657
Not the way he would have liked
to have done it, but he's in the final.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.408
Coming back to the warm-up area,

09:04.544 --> 09:07.582
I keep telling myself it's just
one start, just the one bad start.

09:07.714 --> 09:10.297
You're OK. You ran back well.
That's a positive.

09:10.425 --> 09:13.088
I tried to motivate myself
by telling myself these things.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.461
And my coach came to me,

09:15.597 --> 09:18.635
he never really says much to me,
but he called me over and says...

09:18.767 --> 09:22.511
What the hell is going on out there?
You're trying too hard.

09:22.645 --> 09:25.558
You're making the pressure get to you.

09:25.690 --> 09:30.810
You need to relax, calm,
and take control of the situation.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.436
You are the champion.

09:32.572 --> 09:37.988
The race is not won at 30 meters,
at 40 meters.

09:38.119 --> 09:41.863
And that, for me, really helped
when he said that.

09:41.998 --> 09:45.537
It kinda released my mind,
let me relax a little bit more.

09:45.668 --> 09:50.413
It's just a matter of you going out
there and taking charge, as a champion,

09:50.548 --> 09:53.382
and give a champion performance.

09:55.386 --> 09:59.881
I think Usain Bolt has just given us all
almost heart failure.

10:00.016 --> 10:04.886
He'll need to step it up a gear,
because Justin Gatlin did look good.

10:05.021 --> 10:09.140
Shocking news from the American track
and field camp involving Justin Gatlin,

10:09.275 --> 10:11.938
the doping scandal continues.

10:12.070 --> 10:15.234
But why are you on top now at 33?

10:15.365 --> 10:17.106
I have training partners like Isiah Young

10:17.242 --> 10:18.983
to come out and train, who's a young star.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.236
The long-term effect of steroids...

10:21.371 --> 10:24.239
Do you think you can benefit from this,
even if you are clean now?

10:24.374 --> 10:26.957
I think it's ridiculous.
Why are you asking these questions?

10:27.085 --> 10:29.372
That happened a decade ago.
You're not a history major.

10:29.504 --> 10:31.166
A lot of people don't believe your story.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.289
- Are you a history major?
- I was a history major.

10:33.424 --> 10:36.633
Good. Really good. Then maybe you should
go do that in a museum or something.

10:37.846 --> 10:42.056
I think we've never seen, probably,
a closer encounter for Usain

10:42.183 --> 10:45.142
than we're gonna see tonight
in this stadium.

10:45.270 --> 10:51.688
Gatlin is making 9.7 and change
look easy, comfortably. Strolling.

10:53.903 --> 10:57.067
I get into the warm-up area,
and I looked across at Justin Gatlin,

10:57.198 --> 11:00.032
and I could see the fear in his face.

11:01.953 --> 11:05.617
And he keeps talking to me.
He's saying "yo" and dapping my fist.

11:05.748 --> 11:10.584
And I'm like,
why are we having a conversation?

11:10.712 --> 11:14.296
It's proper rivalry right now.
There's no reason for us to be talking.

11:14.424 --> 11:17.167
Like we are, like,
pretty much the two guys

11:17.302 --> 11:19.134
who are gonna go head-to-head right now.

11:20.471 --> 11:23.430
But the fact that he kept doing that
kind of made me go,

11:23.558 --> 11:25.049
hmm, you're not so confident.

11:31.232 --> 11:36.728
With all the setbacks and
the injury concerns, it's a tall order.

11:36.863 --> 11:42.359
Half of this crowd here
thinks he may lose tonight.

11:42.493 --> 11:45.782
Gosh, I don't even wanna think about it,
I don't even wanna say it because...

11:45.914 --> 11:50.329
I don't know. The sport will be in
a very sad place if that should happen.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.670
We have two guys that's capable
of doing remarkable things.

11:54.797 --> 11:56.709
And when you finally get 'em head-to-head

11:56.841 --> 11:59.174
and go run out here in front of the world,

11:59.302 --> 12:02.921
there's gonna be fireworks,
it's gonna be something special.

12:09.312 --> 12:11.269
Gatlin always walk down...

12:14.776 --> 12:17.519
And then Usain would do a little bit of...

12:22.659 --> 12:25.276
And depending on the crowd's reaction,
he would just...

12:29.207 --> 12:31.620
He came out, and in the back
of his head he's like,

12:31.751 --> 12:33.959
"Oh, God, I wonder if he's ready."

12:34.087 --> 12:35.294
I'm ready.

12:38.883 --> 12:41.466
The Bird's Nest is where, in 2008,

12:41.594 --> 12:43.802
Usain Bolt was crowned sprint king.

12:46.182 --> 12:51.553
Seven years on, is the same venue
about to witness his abdication?

12:58.403 --> 13:00.861
Has Justin Gatlin
and the rest of the world

13:00.989 --> 13:03.572
finally caught the sprint king,
Usain Bolt?

13:03.700 --> 13:06.738
He'll start in five, Gatlin in seven.

13:06.869 --> 13:10.203
American record holder Tyson Gay in six.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.205
Set.

13:15.336 --> 13:20.673
Gun went. I got a good start.
I was like, "Yo, this is good."

13:20.800 --> 13:24.089
Just drive through your drive phases,
drive through, drive through.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.678
At 30 meter I'm like, "Hold on."

13:27.974 --> 13:31.058
"I'm in this race."
I'm like, "Yo, I'm right there."

13:32.437 --> 13:35.020
Gatlin's been running all season
by himself,

13:35.148 --> 13:37.811
but can you handle the pressure
when, at 50 meter,

13:37.942 --> 13:40.150
there's still somebody right there?

13:40.278 --> 13:44.067
We hit 60 meters, and me and Justin,
we start pulling away from the pack.

13:44.198 --> 13:48.943
At 80 meters, I see him
start falling over, and I'm, like,

13:49.078 --> 13:53.072
all I keep telling myself is,
"Listen, do not panic."

13:53.207 --> 13:56.666
Just run through the line
and time this dip because...

13:56.794 --> 14:00.788
because he's falling over and I'm like,
yo, just time this dip perfectly.

14:00.923 --> 14:03.836
Do not dip, do not dip,
and I'm telling myself, do not dip.

14:03.968 --> 14:08.303
I lean. I saw Gatlin, I was like, mm-hmm.

14:08.431 --> 14:11.549
...together here,
it's Gatlin... Here comes Usain Bolt!

14:11.684 --> 14:16.804
And Bolt gets this! Usain Bolt!
He's saved his title!

14:18.024 --> 14:22.735
He's saved his reputation!
He may have even saved his sport!

14:22.862 --> 14:24.569
That's the win...

14:24.697 --> 14:30.864
He's been celebrated so much more
than most others for so many reasons.

14:30.995 --> 14:34.705
That is one of the great historic
moments in the history of sprinting.

14:37.668 --> 14:39.204
Everyone has a responsibility.

14:39.337 --> 14:42.876
Gatlin gets a good start.
He's already up on Zharnel Hughes.

14:43.007 --> 14:46.216
At this point in time, my responsibility
is make that dude run fast.

14:46.344 --> 14:49.587
Usain Bolt is up.
He has a lead over Gatlin.

14:49.722 --> 14:50.963
Can the American come back?

14:51.099 --> 14:53.682
It's an honor to be able to come
out here and put on a great show.

14:53.810 --> 14:57.929
Justin Gatlin is trying to close,
but Bolt's already smiling.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.351
Dare we ever doubt him?

15:00.483 --> 15:03.976
The legend just grows and grows.

15:05.446 --> 15:08.939
What up, people? I'm here. Usain Bolt.

15:09.075 --> 15:12.739
Usain Bolt is just unstoppable.

15:15.415 --> 15:20.331
World champion four times
in the 200 meters. That's what I do.

15:20.461 --> 15:21.918
Mr Bolt.

15:24.215 --> 15:27.708
- Address me right.
- Usain Bolt!

15:35.017 --> 15:39.978
Did we ever dare doubt
he would produce yet another double?

15:44.277 --> 15:46.690
Get things done. What ya laughing for?

15:47.280 --> 15:49.647
Ah, you did well.

15:52.243 --> 15:56.738
- We can start planning.
- Me know, man.

16:05.047 --> 16:07.334
It's not as fun as it used to be.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.584
The older I get, the less fun it is,

16:09.719 --> 16:14.214
because it takes up more of your time
and you have to sacrifice a lot more.

16:17.310 --> 16:21.850
Normally I could just party for a while,
enjoy myself, still train hard and good,

16:21.981 --> 16:24.473
but the older you get,
you can't party as much.

16:24.609 --> 16:27.022
Gotta cut back on going out, drinking...

16:27.153 --> 16:30.612
I gotta start eating proper, go to bed
early, stuff like that, and it's...

16:30.740 --> 16:34.780
For me it's no fun and I hate doing
something that I don't really enjoy,

16:34.911 --> 16:38.325
so I just want to get back into
the real world, you know what I mean?

16:38.456 --> 16:42.075
Just hang out with some people I know,
just not train for, like, two days,

16:42.210 --> 16:45.169
put my foot up, laugh, just chill,
you know what I mean?

16:45.296 --> 16:50.007
Go to bed very late,
just to chill out and just be me

16:50.134 --> 16:52.376
and just to be like a human again,
pretty much.

16:53.971 --> 16:56.679
Just rollin' around in the airport.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.801
Watch it, watch it, watch it.

17:00.937 --> 17:03.680
Almost crashed.

17:03.814 --> 17:05.931
Going home. Back to Jamaica.

17:06.067 --> 17:08.980
Big up, big up, big up, big up, big up.

17:09.111 --> 17:14.402
Mr Coach Mills, how are you feeling
after a long, grueling season?

17:16.035 --> 17:17.242
I'm feeling great.

17:17.369 --> 17:23.332
For the first time, he went into a meet
not being favorite to win,

17:23.459 --> 17:28.545
and this is what makes you a champion,

17:28.673 --> 17:34.044
not just winning
when you're favorite to win

17:34.178 --> 17:37.342
but winning the ones
that you're not supposed to win.

17:37.473 --> 17:41.513
We did a great job in establishing

17:41.644 --> 17:47.606
that we are not just talented
and brilliant coaching,

17:47.733 --> 17:55.027
but we have character and quality
that puts us above the rest.

17:56.826 --> 17:59.489
And I know I'm gonna pay for this.

18:01.664 --> 18:03.576
Team, Team Bolt.

18:03.708 --> 18:06.826
Alright, no, Team Mills. I don't know.

19:08.064 --> 19:09.771
This is my passion when I'm not running.

19:09.899 --> 19:14.360
I love to ride quad bikes. It gives you
that same adrenaline when you run.

19:14.487 --> 19:17.776
The only rule is if you take an orange
tree out, you've got to pay for it.

19:17.907 --> 19:21.526
That's the only rule they have here,
so it's just all fun.

19:50.731 --> 19:53.439
Yeah, you know, when Usain
first came on the scene,

19:53.567 --> 19:57.652
he almost threw the rulebook out,
the textbook out the window in a way.

19:57.780 --> 20:01.615
But, you know, that's... Sometimes you
think maybe that's what makes him great.

20:01.742 --> 20:04.951
You know, he often says
he needs his time away from the track.

20:05.079 --> 20:07.787
If he's always focused,
always thinking about running,

20:07.915 --> 20:09.827
always thinking about how to get faster,

20:09.959 --> 20:11.746
then maybe it has
a negative effect on him.

20:11.877 --> 20:15.541
- Ooh.
- Kill 'em!

20:15.673 --> 20:19.257
- Me pussy!
- Oh, gosh, boy!

20:25.182 --> 20:27.174
For me, Rio is the biggest thing.

20:27.309 --> 20:31.553
I need to go there
and do what's never been done before,

20:31.689 --> 20:35.524
and that's win three more gold medals
at the Olympics.

20:35.651 --> 20:38.439
I like to set myself apart from the rest,

20:38.571 --> 20:41.609
and I'm setting the standard,
so anybody comes, they say,

20:41.741 --> 20:43.949
"Great athlete comes every ten years,"

20:44.076 --> 20:46.489
so if a great athlete comes in ten years,

20:46.620 --> 20:49.158
he's got a lot of work to do
to surpass me.

20:49.290 --> 20:53.375
So Usain likes to have a small team
around him. I see it like a triangle.

20:53.502 --> 20:55.619
At the top there's Coach Mills,
who's his coach,

20:55.755 --> 20:58.873
who's his second father,
who's the one that makes him run fast.

20:59.008 --> 21:02.251
And then he's got NJ, his best friend,
they grew up together,

21:02.386 --> 21:04.673
they went to school together,
he's become his manager.

21:04.805 --> 21:07.718
And then on the other side
of the triangle is me and our staff.

21:07.850 --> 21:10.342
I actually think NJ is
the most important person in his life.

21:10.478 --> 21:12.970
This is called a food samplings.

21:13.105 --> 21:17.349
I have to sample food
and ensure that it is right for Usain.

21:17.485 --> 21:19.977
So if I drop down, yeah?

21:20.112 --> 21:22.445
I have to sample each food an hour before.

21:23.699 --> 21:26.817
Is it true that you sample everything
for Usain before he...?

21:26.952 --> 21:27.908
No.

21:28.037 --> 21:30.279
I think NJ's the one
that keeps him motivated.

21:30.414 --> 21:31.871
He loves him like a brother.

21:31.999 --> 21:35.868
He would take the bullet for Usain
and I think he plays a huge role.

21:36.003 --> 21:39.121
It's very nice of Ricky to say it, though.
I look at it as a team.

21:39.256 --> 21:40.838
Our role in his life

21:40.966 --> 21:44.630
is to get him in the best
physical condition to the championship,

21:44.762 --> 21:45.718
and once you do that,

21:45.846 --> 21:49.635
he's a supreme, confident, mentally
strong athlete who will take gold.

21:50.893 --> 21:53.306
I'm always telling him the truth.

21:53.437 --> 21:58.398
My... Yeah? And I think that's what
we... why our relationship is good.

21:58.526 --> 22:02.770
It has its, of course, it has its
moments, when he has to get up at six

22:02.905 --> 22:05.943
and he wants his friend to say,
"OK, sleep until ten."

22:06.075 --> 22:10.490
I'm, like, "No, gotta get up at six."
He's like, "NJ!"

22:10.621 --> 22:12.988
I didn't set the mark. You set it.

22:13.123 --> 22:16.958
So if you said, "I didn't want to win
in Brazil," I'll leave you alone,

22:17.086 --> 22:22.332
but once we sit and say this is
the plan, you can't change the plan.

22:26.512 --> 22:30.506
If you get the correct body angle,
you can simulate a start.

22:30.641 --> 22:31.927
Go!

22:36.814 --> 22:40.524
Alright, downhill 4.24, uphill 4.60.

22:40.651 --> 22:44.065
- Anything slower than that...
- Coach Mills, I can't.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.483
You gotta do it over.

22:46.615 --> 22:49.824
- I can't work like that.
- It don't register.

22:49.952 --> 22:53.821
You know how it goes...
You got to register a time.

22:53.956 --> 22:55.788
The watch stops working after 4.60.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.291
Go!

23:09.930 --> 23:12.138
Get a bandage. Is it deep?

23:13.017 --> 23:14.098
Yeah.

23:15.686 --> 23:19.430
Bad habits. Bad practices.

23:21.567 --> 23:24.230
Cut it all the time, just spike myself.

23:24.361 --> 23:28.856
This is how you know he's getting fast.
When he's getting fast, he cuts himself.

23:28.991 --> 23:31.233
Do not wipe, Eddie. Dab.

23:36.206 --> 23:37.367
Ah!

23:38.334 --> 23:41.452
I think if I don't cut myself,
I don't feel like I'm going fast enough.

23:41.587 --> 23:43.670
I swear.

23:46.926 --> 23:48.963
Battle scars. Rrrr!

23:49.094 --> 23:50.301
Go!

23:52.264 --> 23:53.596
It's more fluent.

23:53.724 --> 23:58.810
Although you drive with more power,
fluency will make you go faster.

24:01.815 --> 24:03.226
Makes sense.

24:08.113 --> 24:13.950
You see, the mind, the transition
of the mind from one to the other,

24:14.078 --> 24:19.073
sometimes it carry over,
it doesn't change out.

24:19.208 --> 24:22.542
But since you drive pure automatic cars,
you shouldn't...

24:26.882 --> 24:29.465
Coach, why you stay so...?

24:31.136 --> 24:35.050
- How me stay? How me stay, fat?
- We know what he's talking about.

24:35.182 --> 24:38.141
I'ma try an' lose weight.

24:39.269 --> 24:44.060
Turn the tables and he's gone.
You have to just allow him.

24:46.986 --> 24:48.227
Set.

24:49.863 --> 24:50.944
Go!

24:58.205 --> 25:00.288
4.17.

25:02.084 --> 25:07.796
That was good. Fluency, with the power
behind it, makes a big difference.

25:23.689 --> 25:27.524
Being calm, being humble.
That's what Usain got from me.

25:27.651 --> 25:29.608
The good-looking from me.

25:39.121 --> 25:42.239
His parents were great
at instilling discipline in him.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.457
Hard work. His dad...

25:44.585 --> 25:47.623
He would wake up every morning, his dad
is heading out to the coffee farm,

25:47.755 --> 25:50.418
and probably sometime go to bed
and his daddy's just coming in.

25:50.549 --> 25:53.257
And discipline is key for his dad.

25:53.385 --> 25:57.550
He did not give much trouble,
and if you said, "Don't do that,"

25:57.681 --> 26:00.845
he'll try not to do it because he knows
a spanking will be coming.

26:00.976 --> 26:03.889
I would say that he's more,
you know, mischievous

26:04.021 --> 26:06.980
because he likes to, you know,
to be funny.

26:10.069 --> 26:13.779
I guess it all got serious when
one sports day this guy recorded

26:13.906 --> 26:16.023
that he was always beating him
in the 100 meters.

26:16.158 --> 26:20.402
I indicated to him that if he can
beat him, lunch was on me.

26:20.537 --> 26:22.904
Coach said to him,
"We give you box lunch."

26:23.040 --> 26:27.034
In Jamaica that's rice and peas
and fried chicken.

26:28.587 --> 26:32.331
Usain goes, "OK,"
and he won and he got his box lunch.

26:32.466 --> 26:38.258
He demonstrated from then
the aptitude and the discipline

26:38.388 --> 26:40.254
to learning the craft.

26:49.358 --> 26:52.772
Did he tell you about his dad
coming to high school to beat him?

26:52.903 --> 26:53.893
No.

26:54.029 --> 26:59.070
Some friend of his threw a shoe,
hit a girl. He asked him about it.

26:59.201 --> 27:01.818
Of course he was being loyal,
so he didn't rat out the friend.

27:01.954 --> 27:03.286
His dad heard about it.

27:03.413 --> 27:06.906
And I didn't even ask him. At the
school, I see him going up the stairs.

27:07.042 --> 27:07.998
You just grab him.

27:08.127 --> 27:11.962
All I heard was "VJ," and I turn around...

27:12.089 --> 27:14.752
And believe you me, I did beat him.

27:14.883 --> 27:18.092
Everybody just came out
and went on the side of the hill,

27:18.220 --> 27:22.931
and me and my dad was face to face,
and I fold my fists, and he saw,

27:23.058 --> 27:26.267
and it pissed him off even more, and
he was, like, "Yo, you wanna hit me?"

27:26.395 --> 27:28.978
You have just won World Juniors,

27:29.106 --> 27:32.941
you're the most famous high-school kid
in Jamaica,

27:33.068 --> 27:38.234
and your dad shows up at your school,
in the middle of school, and spank you.

27:38.365 --> 27:42.655
Oh! If I was an emotional one,
I would cry.

27:42.786 --> 27:47.156
He did say me wicked.
But now me is the best father.

27:47.291 --> 27:48.782
Him talk about it and him said,

27:48.917 --> 27:52.126
"Daddy, I did say you wicked,
but you is the best father."

28:07.936 --> 28:09.928
Big man now, eh?

28:10.063 --> 28:14.433
- I've grown taller, that's it.
- Grown.

28:15.194 --> 28:18.562
I reckon, on top a' get thin, you know.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.233
Stressful.

28:20.365 --> 28:23.529
Me can't be bald in my 30s.
That don't look good.

28:24.453 --> 28:26.319
Daddy and his bad genes.

28:26.455 --> 28:28.913
- Who the bad?
- Not me.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.749
Your bad genes, man.
Your head done already.

28:32.878 --> 28:37.748
One day I was supposed to go to school
for a track meet.

28:37.883 --> 28:41.342
Dad said,
"What time you supposed to reach?"

28:41.470 --> 28:44.213
Me said seven o'clock but...
me no have to rush.

28:44.348 --> 28:49.093
Four thirty in the mornin'!
He come wake me up.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.811
Four thirty! An' I said, "Daddy, what...?"

28:51.939 --> 28:56.058
"Get up 'n get ready so we can get there."

28:56.193 --> 28:59.106
At six o'clock, we reach the school.

28:59.238 --> 29:01.981
All the man who open the gate asleep.

29:04.493 --> 29:09.739
Bright and early. Me and the caretaker
alone there 'pon de campus.

29:09.873 --> 29:12.786
Man there ever punctual, him never late.

29:12.918 --> 29:17.037
High school he was enjoying it
and we went to a couple of competition,

29:17.172 --> 29:18.834
like Western Championship, and he lost,

29:18.966 --> 29:22.004
but when Usain lose,
he doesn't take it well.

29:22.135 --> 29:26.049
In third form he trained
somewhat seriously, cos Usain,

29:26.181 --> 29:29.720
Usain was so talented that he didn't
have to train really, really hard,

29:29.851 --> 29:34.767
and he put in some semblance of training
and then became the man from the west.

29:42.030 --> 29:45.273
I remember walking down the tunnel
and people were chanting.

29:45.409 --> 29:47.947
I was hearing the chanting,
but I didn't hear it clearly.

29:48.078 --> 29:52.448
And I listened to the crowd and the
crowd was chanting, "Bolt, Bolt, Bolt."

29:52.582 --> 29:54.699
And instantly I just got nervous.

29:55.836 --> 29:59.079
Bolt! Bolt! Bolt!

30:00.173 --> 30:03.666
And my legs were shaking,
my hands were shaking. I was so weak.

30:03.802 --> 30:06.510
I was trying to put on my spikes,
put on one foot

30:06.638 --> 30:09.096
and I was trying to put on the other one
and it wouldn't go on,

30:09.224 --> 30:11.807
and I looked down and I saw it was...
they were on the wrong foot,

30:11.935 --> 30:14.598
and I was like,
"Oh, my God, this is not good."

30:14.730 --> 30:18.019
I get into the blocks.
I was so weak, I was still weak.

30:18.150 --> 30:23.362
But when the gun went, and it go pow,
all that just kinda went away.

30:23.488 --> 30:25.150
It was like, shh, let's go.

30:27.743 --> 30:29.530
I remember coming off the corner,

30:29.661 --> 30:33.075
I felt like I've just gotta push,
like that extra burst of energy,

30:33.206 --> 30:35.243
and I went in front.

30:37.044 --> 30:40.037
Back then my form was awful,
my neck was back,

30:40.172 --> 30:44.291
I was skinny, and I was just running
for my dear life.

30:46.219 --> 30:49.553
The crowd was going crazy.
Everybody was jumping, and...

30:49.681 --> 30:53.800
I don't know why I did it, but I just
walked over and I saluted the crowd,

30:53.935 --> 30:57.144
and when I did that I didn't know
they could get any louder,

30:57.272 --> 30:59.389
but they got louder.

31:02.944 --> 31:06.483
People always say, "What was your best
moment, then?" That is my best moment.

31:06.615 --> 31:11.110
The first time I won a proper
gold medal, I mean a world gold medal,

31:11.244 --> 31:14.157
and it was in front of my people.

31:14.289 --> 31:16.497
That's where it all started,

31:16.625 --> 31:20.118
when I took my first step
into becoming who I am today.

31:21.963 --> 31:25.627
Coming from the rural area
and to step into Kingston, a city,

31:25.759 --> 31:28.046
and perform in front of your home crowd

31:28.178 --> 31:32.798
and to be able to hold his composure
in front of a sell-out stadium,

31:32.933 --> 31:35.016
that's where it all started.

31:35.143 --> 31:38.727
So I think that moment
will always be a special moment.

31:41.483 --> 31:44.942
First...
Are we gonna have a sober weekend?

31:46.238 --> 31:49.402
- Starting now.
- I don't hear a "yes".

31:49.533 --> 31:50.569
Yes, Coach.

31:55.956 --> 31:57.618
No, the "yes" is important,

31:57.749 --> 32:01.914
because I think you have
a little bit of conscience left, so...

32:02.796 --> 32:05.584
you'll remember that you say "yes".

32:07.592 --> 32:10.255
He's a nice guy and he's a good guy,

32:10.387 --> 32:14.051
but I don't know
that he's that easy to coach.

32:14.182 --> 32:20.304
The odd time I have to say, "Look,
I'm in charge," and we move on, so...

32:21.148 --> 32:23.561
Remember you train twice Monday.

32:23.692 --> 32:26.275
- I know that, Coach.
- Huh?

32:26.403 --> 32:27.769
I remember.

32:36.663 --> 32:38.700
What are you doing at this point?

32:38.832 --> 32:43.247
At this point we're using
the ultrasound machine.

32:43.378 --> 32:44.414
Which is that.

32:44.546 --> 32:52.420
To send electronic magnetic waves
into deep within the ligaments

32:52.554 --> 32:55.718
that have been damaged
to stimulate healing.

32:57.642 --> 33:00.555
Well, that's what's happening right now.

33:01.688 --> 33:09.152
Twisted my ankle four days ago
and it was swollen big.

33:09.279 --> 33:12.192
I wish I had recorded it, but I didn't.

33:12.324 --> 33:14.907
In Jamaica they have
something called "money pull-up".

33:15.035 --> 33:17.493
When you hear a bad song,
you give the selector some money

33:17.621 --> 33:18.862
and he starts the song over,

33:18.997 --> 33:22.035
so I was coming to the end in a club
and then one of the songs play

33:22.167 --> 33:24.124
and I wanted to do a "money pull-up",

33:24.336 --> 33:26.293
so I was walking down the stairs,
actually,

33:26.421 --> 33:29.459
and then I got to the barrier
and I was stepping over the barrier.

33:29.591 --> 33:33.255
I stepped on the edge of the ledge
and twisted, just rolled my ankle.

33:39.976 --> 33:40.932
Wow!

33:41.061 --> 33:43.724
A masseuse trying to work on my leg...

33:45.857 --> 33:48.645
while he's trying to burn my leg off
at the same time.

33:48.777 --> 33:51.770
Yeah. After the pain, no gain.

33:53.073 --> 33:54.735
No pain, no gain.

34:01.748 --> 34:06.083
It's always frustrating, every season,
just to deal with injuries.

34:06.211 --> 34:10.420
I was running good, Coach was happy,
and then I twist the ankle.

34:10.549 --> 34:12.962
That's just... That's frustrating.

34:13.092 --> 34:17.303
It was like, shit,
this could be pretty bad.

34:17.429 --> 34:22.721
And for a doctor to say, "Could be out
for a while," then you start worrying.

34:22.851 --> 34:25.889
You know what I mean? Like, "What do you
mean, I could be out for a while?"

34:27.232 --> 34:30.440
So all you have to do right now
is stay off your feet

34:30.569 --> 34:33.107
and that messes with your confidence.

34:35.447 --> 34:39.943
Judging from what he say to me,
he doesn't sound worried.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.320
That doesn't necessarily mean he's not.

34:42.455 --> 34:47.166
Sometimes we do a good job
of hiding our inner feeling,

34:47.293 --> 34:50.286
but he must have concern

34:50.422 --> 34:53.380
because normally, at this time,

34:53.507 --> 34:57.092
he would be far ahead of what he has now.

34:57.220 --> 35:00.304
Originally we didn't think it was
something serious, a sprained ankle.

35:00.432 --> 35:02.765
We thought in two weeks
he's gonna be better,

35:02.892 --> 35:06.385
but then it took three weeks, four
weeks, so we decided to come to Germany.

35:13.903 --> 35:16.020
Usain. Hello.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.405
Hey, man.

35:24.164 --> 35:28.078
- What's up? You alright?
- Very much interested to see.

35:29.002 --> 35:30.334
OK.

35:37.886 --> 35:39.548
All that work.

35:39.679 --> 35:44.845
It's encapsulated
the front part of the ligament. Here.

35:45.894 --> 35:49.137
- This sector here.
- Here was tender.

35:49.272 --> 35:50.934
- Yeah.
- On the bone.

35:51.066 --> 35:54.810
That's the tendon. It is tendovaginitis.

35:54.944 --> 35:58.654
So the tendon had stress and the ligament.

35:58.782 --> 36:01.616
And the tendon still is swollen,

36:01.743 --> 36:06.863
and the surrounding,
where it slips, slipping in,

36:06.998 --> 36:11.618
is swollen too, and this causes pain,

36:11.753 --> 36:13.836
so we have to treat.

36:19.469 --> 36:21.301
Now we have to work on the muscle.

36:21.429 --> 36:28.552
He had to rest. Now he gets
a serious session for muscle training.

36:29.562 --> 36:32.646
It's not good. Mmm.

36:35.026 --> 36:38.144
The injury's bad, it's not as simple
as I thought it would be,

36:38.279 --> 36:42.694
so now it's gonna be
work, work, work, work, work.

36:42.826 --> 36:47.537
Pretty much that's gonna be my life,
so it's not something you wanna hear,

36:47.664 --> 36:50.407
but it has to be done,
so I'm gonna get it done.

36:54.462 --> 36:57.296
The doctor thinks it's gonna be
another three, four weeks

36:57.424 --> 36:59.416
before he can start training again.

36:59.551 --> 37:01.884
It's not something
that we want his rivals to know

37:02.011 --> 37:06.005
because it gives them an edge if they
know he's missed two months of training.

37:06.141 --> 37:08.258
There's only six months left
to the Olympic Games.

37:08.393 --> 37:10.976
It's not an ideal situation
to be in right now.

37:14.357 --> 37:16.064
I try to tell myself, don't worry.

37:16.192 --> 37:19.060
You have the best coach in the world.
It will be fine.

37:19.195 --> 37:22.779
But you still worry about
why this happened on the biggest year.

37:22.907 --> 37:24.614
Am I gonna be ready?

37:24.743 --> 37:26.530
It's gonna be hard.

37:26.661 --> 37:31.326
As it is, he's faced with a gigantic task

37:31.458 --> 37:35.372
because it will be
like starting all over again.

37:35.503 --> 37:42.216
With such a long inactivity on
the track, you lose almost everything.

37:42.343 --> 37:45.336
He has started doing pool training

37:45.472 --> 37:48.806
and will resume
training in the gym and stuff,

37:48.933 --> 37:52.768
but there's no substitute
to actually running on the track.

37:53.938 --> 37:56.146
90. Very good. Let's go.

37:59.152 --> 38:01.895
Come on, that's it.

38:02.030 --> 38:03.771
Four.

38:09.037 --> 38:12.371
Wall is right here,
it's right here, right here. Good. Turn.

38:12.832 --> 38:14.619
Very good. Let's go.

38:14.751 --> 38:19.086
I'm sure that, the champion he is,
good sense will prevail,

38:19.214 --> 38:23.083
and that as painful as it is

38:23.218 --> 38:27.713
and monotonous as it can be
for the next couple of months,

38:27.847 --> 38:32.933
circumstances dictate
that it cannot be business as usual.

38:33.061 --> 38:36.179
So what's the plan, Coach?

38:36.314 --> 38:40.854
Well, the plan is, Mr Bolt,
that you need to work your belly off.

38:42.529 --> 38:47.945
We got a fat athlete here
who's lying on his back,

38:48.076 --> 38:53.071
so we're gonna reduce his meals
and increase the work.

38:54.290 --> 38:58.034
You're going to have to train
twice a day for the rest of the year.

38:58.169 --> 38:59.705
For the rest of the year, Coach?

38:59.838 --> 39:02.455
I listened yesterday and you said

39:02.590 --> 39:08.928
when the coach says it's time,
it's time to go.

39:09.055 --> 39:10.466
No parties.

39:10.598 --> 39:16.014
It's an end to this party-going,
because the coach says it's time to go.

39:16.145 --> 39:19.263
Well, as you see, he's lying on his back.

39:19.399 --> 39:23.268
An unusual position for him. So...

39:23.403 --> 39:24.769
Turn the camera off!

39:24.904 --> 39:26.861
- He...
- Turn the camera off!

39:28.116 --> 39:29.323
Turn the cam...

39:29.450 --> 39:34.241
- It's a sign that he surrenders.
- What can I say? He's the coach.

39:35.665 --> 39:37.782
Have a good day, Coach Mills.

39:37.917 --> 39:38.907
OK.

39:39.043 --> 39:41.285
12, 13, 14.

39:41.421 --> 39:43.754
Coach Mills is just a genius, man.

39:43.882 --> 39:47.250
Like, I've been injured so much
over the years, through the seasons,

39:47.385 --> 39:51.174
and he's always found a way
to get me in shape for the big moment.

39:51.306 --> 39:53.343
Always. I don't know how he does it.

39:54.475 --> 39:57.263
Final. Oh, good.

39:57.395 --> 40:01.389
His career has been in...
as dramatic as it is,

40:01.524 --> 40:07.942
has also been punctuated
by bouts of injury.

40:08.072 --> 40:10.689
2004 was his first year
running as a professional,

40:10.825 --> 40:12.566
but we spent the whole summer

40:12.702 --> 40:14.864
looking for chiropractors
and doctors and physios

40:14.996 --> 40:17.864
to try and fix his back
and his hamstrings.

40:17.999 --> 40:21.083
At that point, in 2004, '05,
you know, you were kind of, like,

40:21.210 --> 40:24.544
OK, is this guy ever gonna fulfil
the promise he showed as a junior?

40:24.672 --> 40:27.710
I wasn't happy. I was pushing my body
too hard and I was not used to it.

40:27.842 --> 40:30.505
And I used to watch Mr Mills
coaching the guys.

40:30.637 --> 40:33.675
I was, like, yo,
I would love Mr Mills to coach me.

40:35.099 --> 40:40.720
Well, first I did not agree
because I was saying to him,

40:40.855 --> 40:43.814
because you don't want to do the
training, you are a little bit too lazy.

40:43.942 --> 40:46.650
He said, "Daddy, you don't know
what I am feeling,"

40:46.778 --> 40:48.269
and he did it on his own.

40:48.404 --> 40:51.522
We didn't like it,
but of course it was the right decision.

40:52.659 --> 40:54.946
The problem was his scoliosis.

40:55.078 --> 40:57.195
It affected his worse hip

40:57.330 --> 41:02.325
which affected his hamstring
and just a chain of reaction.

41:02.460 --> 41:06.875
Scoliosis means the spine was straight

41:07.006 --> 41:11.467
and the lumber part a little to the side.

41:11.594 --> 41:13.085
That was all.

41:13.221 --> 41:17.761
That the coach saw, he said, "Something
is wrong. Go to Muller-Wohlfahrt."

41:17.892 --> 41:22.853
So we set about doing
the specific exercises

41:22.981 --> 41:28.943
to develop the strength of his lower
back and then to stabilize his hip.

41:33.950 --> 41:36.943
It was a tough 2004, 2005, 2006,

41:37.078 --> 41:41.743
and I think it was really up until 2007
that, you know, you started to say, OK,

41:41.874 --> 41:43.991
he's now getting
consistently better and better,

41:44.127 --> 41:47.370
and he lost the World Championship
in 2007.

41:47.505 --> 41:50.248
He came off the curve level with Tyson Gay

41:50.383 --> 41:53.672
and he thought he should go away and win
and he couldn't,

41:53.803 --> 41:56.716
he just didn't have any gears left,
and then he sat down.

41:56.848 --> 41:58.840
I remember that night,
he went back and he said,

41:58.975 --> 42:01.968
"Coach, I can't do this again.
I've gotta win the next time."

42:03.896 --> 42:08.061
Coach says, "Listen to me. You're too
weak and you need to do another event

42:08.192 --> 42:10.275
to get your strength up or your speed up."

42:10.403 --> 42:12.019
I was like, "Alright, so where?"

42:12.155 --> 42:14.568
He's like, "Yo, next season
we need to run the 400 meters."

42:14.699 --> 42:17.783
I'm like, "Hold on, no,"
cos the training's too hard.

42:21.080 --> 42:24.824
He's like, "You're too slow
to run the 100 meters

42:24.959 --> 42:26.541
and your start is really bad."

42:26.669 --> 42:29.753
So I was like, "Let's make a deal.
Give me one 100 meters try-out."

42:29.881 --> 42:35.673
"If I run slow, I run the 400 meters.
If I run fast, I run the 100 meters."

42:40.558 --> 42:43.596
Ran 10.03, and I was like, "Hey, 10.03."

42:43.728 --> 42:48.723
A lot of guys were running 10.03
at that time, so... I got my wish.

42:54.739 --> 42:56.446
Set.

42:58.076 --> 43:02.195
Finally, a clean start.
Will it be a historic 100 meters?

43:02.330 --> 43:07.121
Usain Bolt has the step.
Usain Bolt blowing away the field.

43:07.251 --> 43:13.339
Usain Bolt takes the men's 100 meters!
It's a new world record! 9.71!

43:13.466 --> 43:15.002
9.71!

43:15.134 --> 43:21.222
Usain Bolt has run the fastest
100 meters in the history of humankind.

43:21.349 --> 43:26.469
That is the fastest any human
has ever covered 100 meters.

43:26.604 --> 43:29.187
There's an old Chinese proverb that says,

43:29.315 --> 43:32.729
"The journey is as important
as the destination,"

43:32.860 --> 43:38.151
and I believe that
if you pay attention to the journey

43:38.282 --> 43:42.572
and you do the right things,
you reach the right destination.

43:44.247 --> 43:46.159
No matter how fast you run,

43:46.290 --> 43:49.033
there is gonna be a time that
someone's gonna break those records.

43:49.168 --> 43:54.630
However, when it comes to being
Olympic champion, it's etched in stone,

43:54.757 --> 43:59.092
and at no point whatsoever is
that title gonna be taken away from you,

43:59.220 --> 44:01.052
so the title is there for life.

44:01.180 --> 44:04.469
- Hold on there. What say you call?
- You're the best roommate ever.

44:04.600 --> 44:06.136
Me?

44:06.394 --> 44:07.475
Yes, you.

44:07.603 --> 44:12.974
I was roommates with Usain.
That guy was... was something else, man.

44:13.109 --> 44:15.897
Well, on my corner, right,
you gotta have your orange juice.

44:16.028 --> 44:17.735
- Yeah, yeah.
- Vitamin C.

44:17.864 --> 44:19.275
So go down smooth.

44:19.407 --> 44:21.774
We got a water.
I can't really read Chinese...

44:21.909 --> 44:23.445
Yeah, yeah.

44:23.578 --> 44:28.164
And then we have some Lacoste.
Keep my fresh, you know what I say?

44:28.291 --> 44:31.534
Keep my fresh. One more thing.
This is my baby.

44:31.669 --> 44:34.833
- Alright. Let me see it.
- C'mon, baby thing.

44:34.964 --> 44:38.423
Yo, cut out that. Cut out that.

44:38.551 --> 44:40.713
Hold that. See there? Coach, that.

44:40.845 --> 44:47.012
Coach Glen Mills. The best coach
in the world. In the world.

44:47.143 --> 44:51.729
Coach Mills was right next door,
and he'll be banging on the walls, man,

44:51.856 --> 44:58.069
just "Usain! It's time to go to sleep.
You got the 100 meter tomorrow."

45:01.115 --> 45:06.531
- It's late, man, come on.
- Yeah, I'm putting on my shoes, Coach.

45:06.662 --> 45:10.827
I watched the 100 meter at my sister's
house, up by the road there.

45:10.958 --> 45:12.415
It was nerve-racking.

45:12.543 --> 45:17.629
Going to the Bird's Nest, it was
such fun. The place was beautiful.

45:17.757 --> 45:22.502
Throughout his career,
I've never stood beside Coach Mills.

45:22.637 --> 45:25.630
I don't even know where Coach Mills
watches the races from.

45:25.765 --> 45:27.757
I always stay by myself.

45:27.892 --> 45:29.599
I went to the stadium for that one.

45:29.727 --> 45:32.845
Actually, I was
right behind the starting blocks.

45:35.942 --> 45:39.151
Got to the line.
I was hyper, I was really hyper.

45:39.278 --> 45:40.814
Set.

45:41.656 --> 45:43.363
When the race started,

45:43.491 --> 45:45.824
I was just,
"I need to get this first 50 right."

45:46.953 --> 45:53.325
I was nervous, believe you me.
I shed tears with that race as well.

45:56.504 --> 45:58.461
30 meters, I looked,
I was slightly behind,

45:58.589 --> 46:01.377
then I ran to 50
and I was in line with everyone.

46:01.509 --> 46:05.423
I ran the race with Usain.
I was up jumping.

46:05.554 --> 46:09.343
A fair start, Asafa Powell.
Usain Bolt is also out well.

46:09.475 --> 46:11.262
I expected Asafa to be ahead.

46:11.394 --> 46:13.636
Everybody looked across, he wasn't there,

46:13.771 --> 46:16.354
so I was like, you know what,
continue running.

46:16.482 --> 46:19.691
Ran to 60. Kinda checked. Ran to 70.

46:19.819 --> 46:20.980
It went by so quick.

46:22.113 --> 46:25.606
I got to 80 meters, I was like hold on,
where's Asafa, you know what I mean?

46:25.741 --> 46:29.280
And then I was like, "Oh, shit, I'm
gonna win." I start beating my chest.

46:29.453 --> 46:31.445
Usain Bolt sprinting ahead,

46:31.580 --> 46:36.700
winning by daylight
and setting a world record.

46:36.836 --> 46:41.706
I have never seen another 100-meter
Olympic champion run that easy.

46:41.841 --> 46:43.377
He dominated the field.

46:43.509 --> 46:46.968
Oh, shit! Oh, my God!

46:47.430 --> 46:48.841
Whoo!

46:50.224 --> 46:53.843
Did you see that shit? Did you see that?

46:53.978 --> 46:57.312
That's my roommate! That's my roommate!

46:59.525 --> 47:02.609
People are saying, why did I celebrate?
Well, it just happened.

47:02.737 --> 47:06.981
It just came out of me
because that's what I felt.

47:07.116 --> 47:09.654
You're coming up to the line
and you go, "Oh!"

47:09.785 --> 47:13.028
"This is it. This is it.
This is what I've been working on."

47:14.248 --> 47:16.331
I can't believe I've finally done it.

47:18.294 --> 47:22.334
It's just so much work to get to
that one moment, to win that one moment.

47:23.466 --> 47:26.459
I just remember he literally exploded.

47:26.594 --> 47:29.132
That image in Beijing
of him pounding his chest, you know,

47:29.263 --> 47:32.472
as he crosses that finish line is like,
wait, can he go faster than that?

47:33.684 --> 47:39.180
I mean, everyone could see
that he was something special. He...

47:39.315 --> 47:42.899
A man like him is not born very often.

47:43.027 --> 47:47.988
Yes. I just witnessed
something great, great.

47:48.115 --> 47:49.981
I can't explain it what the man just do.

47:50.117 --> 47:53.110
- Say something for them.
- Well, I just did what I had to do.

47:53.245 --> 47:58.036
I went out there and I executed,
and now I am Olympic champion.

47:58.167 --> 48:00.159
It's not like we never see it coming.

48:00.294 --> 48:02.536
- God damn!
- God damn!

48:04.048 --> 48:05.505
The next thing is 200 meters.

48:05.633 --> 48:08.376
I'm going through the rounds
and I'm feeling tired.

48:08.511 --> 48:10.798
And I remember the night before,

48:10.930 --> 48:13.764
my roommate, Maurice Smith,
was sitting down and he goes,

48:13.891 --> 48:16.258
"Yo, you're gonna break
the 200-meter world record,"

48:16.394 --> 48:18.351
and I go, "It's hard, man."

48:18.479 --> 48:23.395
We stayed up chatting till
I think it was like five in the morning.

48:23.526 --> 48:26.610
And he's like, "Yo, you can do it."

48:27.988 --> 48:29.570
Yeah. Hot gym now.

48:32.076 --> 48:35.194
Usain, you better get ready for go
after the 200 finals.

48:35.329 --> 48:39.915
You don't know enough.
I'm gonna zoom in there.

48:40.042 --> 48:41.249
- Fresh, ain't I?
- Yeah.

48:41.377 --> 48:42.959
- Fresh.
- Fresh to death.

48:43.087 --> 48:44.919
I cut his hair before he went out

48:45.047 --> 48:49.508
and, you know, we goofed off a lot
about him having his fresh cut

48:49.635 --> 48:51.422
and, you know, he did a thing

48:51.595 --> 48:54.429
where he rubbed his head like this
before the race.

48:56.434 --> 48:57.925
I had the decathlon the next day,

48:58.060 --> 49:01.895
so I stayed at the village
and watched that with the teammates.

49:06.652 --> 49:10.236
Nesta Carter, Michael Frater, Asafa.

49:13.075 --> 49:15.408
On your marks.

49:15.536 --> 49:17.277
If you watch the race, you can see,

49:17.413 --> 49:20.451
as soon as the gun goes,
I'm like so focused.

49:20.624 --> 49:22.115
Set.

49:34.263 --> 49:35.595
I'm watching the clock

49:35.723 --> 49:37.965
and I'm like,
"Yo, I can make it, I can make it."

49:45.065 --> 49:48.058
When I saw it, I didn't know what to do.
I was like...

49:50.654 --> 49:54.944
I was happy, I was so happy, I was...
That's when all the joy came out.

49:58.579 --> 50:01.242
It's one of the best things in the world!

50:01.499 --> 50:03.866
I have to join the celebration!

50:13.719 --> 50:18.714
Look what happened to the place after
the man ran the world record on the 200.

50:18.849 --> 50:20.511
Watch this.

50:20.643 --> 50:22.680
Yo, they mash up the place.

50:28.192 --> 50:31.526
We were watching the girls
and they dropped the baton and we go...

50:31.654 --> 50:33.236
we all looked at each other like...

50:33.364 --> 50:37.233
Jesus. So Usain,
Usain called us together and said, "Yo."

50:37.368 --> 50:41.658
Team meeting.
Let's just get the baton around.

50:41.789 --> 50:45.954
And I remember, I looked him
straight in the eye and I said,

50:46.085 --> 50:49.920
"I'm giving you
a third world record at this Olympics

50:50.047 --> 50:52.164
and another gold medal,
don't worry yourself."

50:52.299 --> 50:54.040
And there's the gun.

50:54.176 --> 50:56.634
Nesta Carter runs the lead-off
for Jamaica.

50:56.762 --> 50:59.846
Looking down the track and I see
Michael Frater coming towards me.

50:59.974 --> 51:02.682
Michael Frater's, like, five six,

51:02.810 --> 51:04.972
and he looks like six five, he's so tall.

51:05.104 --> 51:08.017
I'm like, he's coming so fast.

51:08.148 --> 51:11.812
Should I run off or should I wait?
Oh, shit, oh, shit.

51:12.278 --> 51:16.864
Hand-off to Bolt and he's
on his way around the curve.

51:16.991 --> 51:18.983
Look at Bolt go with
those big, long strides.

51:19.285 --> 51:23.245
Giving the baton, I remember
screaming to him, "Run, Asafa!"

51:23.372 --> 51:25.204
And Asafa Powell has it...

51:25.332 --> 51:28.075
"Go on, Asafa! Go on, Asafa!"

51:28.210 --> 51:32.454
I remember, I remember that and, I mean,
I just felt, I just felt a boost,

51:32.590 --> 51:34.547
and I felt strong and powerful

51:34.675 --> 51:36.837
and went down the track
and I saw the world record.

51:36.969 --> 51:38.585
Asafa Powell...

51:38.721 --> 51:40.929
I was more happy for him
than even for myself,

51:41.056 --> 51:45.266
you know, because it was his Olympic
and that was his time to shine.

51:45.394 --> 51:49.013
Asafa really started it,
breaking world records, and I said,

51:49.148 --> 51:51.265
"I wanna do that.
I wanna be on that level."

51:52.359 --> 51:58.230
Another reason why I'm so proud of him,
he did what I wanted to do, you know,

51:58.365 --> 52:02.609
he went on and he did better than,
you know, I wanted to do

52:02.745 --> 52:04.361
and, you know, I'm really proud of that.

52:04.496 --> 52:08.240
For somebody to move from rival
instantly into your teammate

52:08.375 --> 52:09.707
and then fully on your side

52:09.835 --> 52:14.626
shows the bond of not Jamaicans
but as friends also.

52:21.430 --> 52:23.843
If you're a young guy
an' you don't have the talent

52:23.974 --> 52:27.183
or you don't want to work on the talent,
then don't do it, then.

52:27.311 --> 52:30.224
Try and find something else.
There's tons of sports.

52:30.356 --> 52:32.473
What is that thing them... curling?

52:36.654 --> 52:40.443
- See what I'm saying?
- First on the broom.

52:42.284 --> 52:43.741
Yeah, curling.

52:43.869 --> 52:47.453
You want to be a winner,
you have to work hard to be a winner.

52:47.581 --> 52:50.540
- True...
- You have to teach 'em that!

52:51.502 --> 52:54.666
- Me, I grew up in a...
- You should encourage them!

52:54.838 --> 52:56.955
- What did my father tell me?
- What did he tell you?

52:57.091 --> 52:58.502
"Work for what you want."

52:58.634 --> 53:01.377
Did he say,
"Oh, Usain, you're a loser today"?

53:01.512 --> 53:05.677
I wasn't, though...
I wasn't a loser, though.

53:05.808 --> 53:08.471
But I'm saying, even then
if there's anythin' you want in life,

53:08.602 --> 53:09.638
you gotta work for it.

53:09.770 --> 53:11.056
That my father instilled in us.

53:11.188 --> 53:17.105
"If you run and you lose, you have
to try harder and you lose, stop it."

53:18.946 --> 53:21.029
Simple as that. You understand.

53:22.157 --> 53:26.026
No, that fact of...
Yo, the fact of the matter.

53:26.161 --> 53:29.154
- Some of them developed late.
- What happens to the late bloomers?

53:29.289 --> 53:32.657
Thank you, thank you.
What happens to the late bloomers?

53:32.793 --> 53:35.581
- You can't discourage late bloomers.
- The late bloomers.

53:35.713 --> 53:38.000
The ones that take
a little bit more time to do...

53:38.132 --> 53:40.044
Take time to develop, late bloomers.

53:40.175 --> 53:43.839
Name someone who you know
that developed late. Name one person.

53:43.971 --> 53:45.052
- Who is great?
- Yeah.

53:45.180 --> 53:47.593
- Who is great?
- Nobody.

53:47.725 --> 53:49.387
Yeah, man.

53:55.399 --> 53:58.517
Getting his feet ready
to take on the world.

54:02.156 --> 54:04.113
Good condition, Coach Mills.

54:05.159 --> 54:06.570
Go.

54:14.042 --> 54:15.624
It was my first day of training.

54:15.753 --> 54:18.587
Finally I could run
with a little bit of pain. It felt good.

54:18.714 --> 54:22.048
I was like, I'm back on the track,
that's a positive side about this.

54:22.176 --> 54:24.042
So, Coach, what do you think?

54:26.013 --> 54:30.132
One good thing about the run,
he's not as fat as the coach any more.

54:35.022 --> 54:38.732
Hey. So, I'm pretty bored.

54:38.859 --> 54:45.072
Can't sleep. So just decided
to talk to the camera a little bit.

54:46.116 --> 54:48.950
I'm gonna
show you why I'm spinning around.

54:50.245 --> 54:51.736
Alright. Give me a minute.

54:51.872 --> 54:55.991
I'm in my hotel room just going around.

54:57.336 --> 54:59.953
With my coach, he's always saying,
"Usain, you should sleep."

55:00.088 --> 55:02.580
"It's very important for you
to get your rest and stuff."

55:02.716 --> 55:09.464
So I try my best to get my sleep,
especially this year, I've really tried.

55:09.598 --> 55:11.681
What people don't understand with Usain

55:11.809 --> 55:13.220
is that cos he's so recognizable,

55:13.352 --> 55:15.765
everywhere he goes,
he doesn't really do much.

55:15.896 --> 55:17.979
I can go to the shopping mall,
I can go to the cinema,

55:18.106 --> 55:20.689
but Usain's pretty much in-house
a lot of the day.

55:20.818 --> 55:24.152
What else to talk about? I've no idea.

55:26.824 --> 55:31.364
So this is a Jamaican introduction,
introduction. Wallet!

55:32.496 --> 55:35.079
No s... Oh, I almost fall over.

55:35.207 --> 55:37.699
Especially when he's travelling,
he's in his hotel room,

55:37.835 --> 55:40.043
you can go stir crazy,

55:40.170 --> 55:43.789
so often at one in the morning he gets
bored and, like, let me go somewhere,

55:43.924 --> 55:46.837
and I can understand why he just can't
sit in his room all the time.

55:47.010 --> 55:50.174
- # My mind tell me no
- # My mind tell me no

55:52.808 --> 55:54.094
# But my body

55:54.226 --> 55:56.058
# But my body

55:56.186 --> 55:58.178
# Telling me yes

55:58.313 --> 56:00.350
# Telling me yes

56:01.066 --> 56:02.648
- # Baby
- # Baby

56:03.527 --> 56:07.020
- # I don't wanna hurt nobody
- # I don't wanna hurt nobody

56:07.155 --> 56:13.743
# But there is something
that I must confess

56:13.871 --> 56:17.535
# I...

56:19.459 --> 56:25.706
- # I don't see nothing wrong
- # I don't see nothing wrong

56:25.841 --> 56:29.050
# With a little bump and grind...

56:29.177 --> 56:30.884
I love this song, I'm sorry.

56:32.347 --> 56:35.886
I'm just remembering that this is
gonna go out nationally to the world.

56:36.018 --> 56:39.432
I shouldn't be singing.
I'm not a good singer, but...

56:39.563 --> 56:43.227
Just letting you know what my life
is about when I'm bored sometimes.

56:43.358 --> 56:46.396
- # With a little bump and grind
- # Bump and grind

56:46.528 --> 56:50.147
# I don't, I don't see

57:03.837 --> 57:08.502
It's hard to be as hungry as a person
who has never won a championship.

57:08.634 --> 57:11.172
It's hard. No matter how people say,

57:11.303 --> 57:13.420
"I'm very hungry,
I still wanna be a champion,"

57:13.555 --> 57:17.219
it's hard to be as hungry as a guy
who's never won an Olympic champion.

57:17.351 --> 57:19.809
I've been going through this for years.

57:19.937 --> 57:21.644
Started out with my mom and my dad,

57:21.772 --> 57:24.810
I wanted to clear their debts,
buy them things,

57:24.942 --> 57:29.778
and then it was for me, to get nice
stuff, cars, clothes, all this stuff.

57:29.905 --> 57:32.648
Then it was just to secure my future.

57:32.783 --> 57:36.367
But now that I've done most of that stuff,

57:36.495 --> 57:39.363
it makes me just wanna give up,
do you know what I mean?

57:39.498 --> 57:42.912
It worries me, at this point in my career,

57:43.043 --> 57:49.085
now at a big stage, that I still have
issues motivating myself now.

57:49.216 --> 57:52.254
I remember I was sitting at home
and he called me up and he's like,

57:52.386 --> 57:57.677
he's like, "John, I'm over this shit,"
and I was like, "Oh, OK."

57:57.808 --> 58:01.051
"You know, I just wanna have
a normal life and relax."

58:01.186 --> 58:04.350
"Now all I can think of is vacationing.
I can't think of anything else."

58:04.481 --> 58:06.518
I know last year
it was the World Championship,

58:06.650 --> 58:08.391
I'm like, it's the World Championship,

58:08.527 --> 58:11.190
I wanna win, but it's not the Olympics,
do you know what I mean?

58:11.321 --> 58:13.688
But then it gets to this season.

58:13.824 --> 58:17.317
It's still like, I'm lazy,
do I really need to do this?

58:17.452 --> 58:19.409
What do I have to prove,
do you know what I mean?

58:19.538 --> 58:21.871
And same thing with Michael Johnson.
I asked him.

58:21.999 --> 58:24.616
He said, "Yo, I've done everything
in the sports, why stay?"

58:24.751 --> 58:27.869
I think you get to a point, as an athlete,

58:28.005 --> 58:30.998
where it becomes
less about competing against others

58:31.174 --> 58:34.542
and more about competing against yourself.

58:34.678 --> 58:36.886
It's a much more lonely pursuit.

58:37.931 --> 58:41.140
I think lonely is...
It goes deeper than that.

58:41.268 --> 58:44.557
I feel like it is, it's gut-wrenching.

58:44.688 --> 58:47.271
You're at a place that no one else is,

58:47.399 --> 58:53.020
and sometimes you just feel like,
you know, no one is in your shoes.

58:53.989 --> 58:56.402
In terms of daily motivation for training,

58:56.533 --> 58:58.445
you've got to motivate yourself

58:58.577 --> 59:03.993
based only on you and what you want
and how bad do you want it.

59:05.000 --> 59:09.745
When the battle is with yourself,
you can't lie to yourself.

59:09.880 --> 59:12.964
When you look in the mirror,
you know all the truth.

59:14.217 --> 59:19.633
Battling with yourself is... is...
That's deep.

59:19.765 --> 59:22.553
I think a lot of times you lose control
when you're at this level

59:22.684 --> 59:25.722
because everyone's pulling you
from one direction, another direction.

59:25.854 --> 59:28.141
I think sometimes
you want your own personal life back.

59:28.273 --> 59:31.687
When you can say, "I'm waking up at this
time, I'm doing this when I wanna do it,

59:31.818 --> 59:35.607
I'm going out here," you know, and I
think sometimes he's had enough of this.

59:35.739 --> 59:39.574
When the time comes for you
to just enjoy yourself sometimes,

59:39.701 --> 59:44.287
even during the season I take a weekend
and just have fun with my friends.

59:52.255 --> 59:56.625
Just to me when we spoke, it did
sound like a guy crying out for help.

59:56.760 --> 59:57.796
You know what I mean?

59:57.928 --> 01:00:02.172
And he'd do anything he could
to self-sabotage what he was doing,

01:00:02.307 --> 01:00:03.548
just to have an out.

01:00:06.103 --> 01:00:08.015
10.95.

01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:12.766
And I guess the answer he was
expecting to hear from me was,

01:00:12.901 --> 01:00:15.393
"Nah, man, you need to get ready
for the Olympic Games."

01:00:15.529 --> 01:00:16.940
I was like, "Bruv, quit."

01:00:18.115 --> 01:00:20.277
"Will you be happier?"

01:00:20.408 --> 01:00:24.197
And he was like... he sort of stalled
a little bit and was like,

01:00:24.329 --> 01:00:27.493
"Yeah, yeah. I just wanna relax."

01:00:33.255 --> 01:00:36.293
Sometime after Rio,
I'm gonna cut out the track and field.

01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:40.005
Just breathe.

01:00:41.596 --> 01:00:43.588
I feel like me have asthma.

01:00:47.519 --> 01:00:49.727
Everybody knows, even his competitors,

01:00:49.855 --> 01:00:52.973
that he's the most talented athlete ever,

01:00:53.108 --> 01:00:56.692
so if he doesn't win,
it's not because of his talent.

01:00:56.820 --> 01:00:58.652
It's gonna be a failure on my part,

01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:01.818
Ricky's part, his family's part,
not to motivate him.

01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:06.035
Close up. Close up. Close up.

01:01:06.163 --> 01:01:09.747
Certain persons cannot handle a party.

01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:12.162
We're trying to hold him back
and we're trying to say,

01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:14.873
"Come on, Usain, the Olympics
is getting closer, come on."

01:01:15.005 --> 01:01:18.169
"Give it three months, then you can do
all these things the rest of your life."

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:24.137
For me, it would destroy me,
knowing that I'm a part of his team,

01:01:24.264 --> 01:01:27.098
I wasn't able to help him
to find that motivation.

01:01:37.152 --> 01:01:38.688
Good morning, boss man.

01:01:42.991 --> 01:01:45.074
Hey, Ricky.

01:01:45.994 --> 01:01:48.077
Got ya.

01:01:49.456 --> 01:01:52.665
This is the sleep cam.
Usain Bolt's sleep cam.

01:01:52.792 --> 01:01:54.283
He didn't go out last night.

01:01:54.419 --> 01:01:59.505
This is how the world's fastest man wakes up.
Not so fast now, huh? Huh?

01:02:02.427 --> 01:02:05.010
I know himself, the winner in him,

01:02:05.138 --> 01:02:08.848
he wouldn't want to see Rio come on
and he's not there,

01:02:08.975 --> 01:02:10.682
so we might have to ask him the question,

01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:12.722
"Do you not want to go to Rio?"

01:02:12.854 --> 01:02:17.770
And once you put that on the table,
we believe that Usain Bolt will respond.

01:02:17.901 --> 01:02:23.397
Earlier this year I've said to you guys
that, yo, I'm having doubts, I'm not...

01:02:23.531 --> 01:02:25.898
Not doubts,
I'm not having the same feeling,

01:02:26.034 --> 01:02:28.742
like I'm not motivated, but then...

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:32.621
Are you going to win?

01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:35.082
- Justin, we need to hear you say...
- We need a guarantee.

01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:37.543
- ..."I'm bringing the gold medal..."
- I'm going to win.

01:02:37.671 --> 01:02:38.832
"...back to the US of A."

01:02:38.964 --> 01:02:40.956
- He just said he's gonna win.
- I'm going to win.

01:02:41.091 --> 01:02:44.255
- Oh, yes!
- We bring it to LA, to New York.

01:02:44.386 --> 01:02:46.594
We go out on a tour all around the country

01:02:46.721 --> 01:02:48.838
with that ribbon around my neck
like a gold chain.

01:02:48.974 --> 01:02:50.260
That's what I'm talking about.

01:02:51.893 --> 01:02:57.059
And as soon as I watch that video,
soon as I watch that video...

01:02:58.650 --> 01:03:00.607
everything changed.

01:03:01.987 --> 01:03:05.401
I didn't... I'm not saying
I got back my full motivation.

01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:11.073
I'm not saying that I was cured
or I was saved or it was a epiphany,

01:03:11.204 --> 01:03:18.418
but I got that feeling, that feeling
in my stomach that, "Yo, what?"

01:03:18.545 --> 01:03:22.710
"He's gonna beat me? Hell, no."
You know what I mean?

01:03:22.841 --> 01:03:27.131
The truth is I'm gonna retire soon,
so I can comfortably say this.

01:03:29.681 --> 01:03:31.764
They don't understand that, though.

01:03:36.271 --> 01:03:38.638
What makes me, what makes me...

01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:47.189
strive is the fact
that they talk all the time.

01:03:47.324 --> 01:03:52.160
I love competition, so when you talk
and tell me what you're gonna do,

01:03:52.287 --> 01:03:54.529
all it makes me wanna do is work harder.

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:58.954
So... big up to yourself, Justin Gatlin.

01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:06.838
Five thirty. Don't know why I'm up
this early. Gotta work out.

01:04:06.968 --> 01:04:10.302
Life of a champion, right? Full marks.

01:04:34.496 --> 01:04:39.082
Five, six. Don't bounce it.
Seven. Don't bounce it.

01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:41.246
Eight, nine, ten.

01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:46.880
Seven. Seven. 24. 25.

01:04:52.055 --> 01:04:53.717
Good job.

01:05:42.981 --> 01:05:48.693
Everybody knows that I'm the coach
and I have the authority.

01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:50.777
I don't have to wear it on my face.

01:05:51.906 --> 01:05:53.898
We joke a lot.

01:05:54.033 --> 01:06:00.451
We try to make the whole thing exciting
because he likes fun.

01:06:01.708 --> 01:06:05.702
Remember you said you'd do a high jump?
Where was it? In Europe or something?

01:06:05.837 --> 01:06:10.423
- Ostrava.
- Ostrava? And that was super.

01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:12.542
But it's the javelin I want to throw.

01:06:12.677 --> 01:06:14.043
How much money you bet on it again?

01:06:14.179 --> 01:06:16.717
I don't know how much money,
but you have to give me something.

01:06:16.848 --> 01:06:18.885
- Bolt... what we saying?
- Over a hundred dollar.

01:06:19.017 --> 01:06:20.974
What did we say,
you can't throw over 50 meters?

01:06:21.102 --> 01:06:22.138
50 or 60...

01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:25.434
No, no, no, no. I have to be in that bet.

01:06:25.565 --> 01:06:27.101
You think I can't throw that?

01:06:27.233 --> 01:06:28.349
50 what?

01:06:29.611 --> 01:06:31.193
No, I'm gonna bet now.

01:06:31.321 --> 01:06:33.984
I'm telling you you can't throw it...
I'm telling you.

01:06:34.115 --> 01:06:36.653
- How much you wanna bet?
- What?

01:06:36.784 --> 01:06:40.027
- A mill? One million?
- What?

01:06:40.163 --> 01:06:42.997
- You sure?
- Yeah, man.

01:06:43.124 --> 01:06:44.160
You can't throw over 60.

01:06:44.292 --> 01:06:45.373
- 50 to 60.
- No, no, no, no.

01:06:45.502 --> 01:06:48.961
60. You can't change it now.
60 we say now.

01:06:49.088 --> 01:06:50.704
- The man dem say yo...
- No, no, no, no.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.376
Not them. Me! My bet is 60.

01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:55.502
They told me I can't throw over 50 meters.

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:58.386
I told them I can go 60, let me tell you.

01:06:58.515 --> 01:07:00.928
You can't do 60.

01:07:01.059 --> 01:07:02.391
You go, you go.

01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:06.854
We'll have a shake. You hear that?
He can't throw 60 with a javelin.

01:07:06.981 --> 01:07:11.271
- 60 is my bet.
- I won't argue. Just give me my money.

01:07:11.402 --> 01:07:14.770
Coach, listen, me seen the other
athletes stand up and throw 40.

01:07:14.906 --> 01:07:16.317
Just stand and throw.

01:07:16.449 --> 01:07:21.365
Eddie say you cannot throw 60
and Eddie teach it. Eddie's a teacher.

01:07:21.496 --> 01:07:25.285
Me nah worried.
Listen to me, I get my three tries...

01:07:25.416 --> 01:07:27.703
- Three tries?
- You always get three tries.

01:07:27.835 --> 01:07:30.418
- One try.
- One try?

01:07:30.547 --> 01:07:33.290
- One try, you know.
- It can't be one throw.

01:07:33.424 --> 01:07:35.541
When you ever hear
someone get one try for a bet?

01:07:35.677 --> 01:07:39.887
- In our arrangement.
- No, that's not how it works.

01:07:40.014 --> 01:07:43.428
- You must get warm-up throws.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:07:50.024 --> 01:07:58.273
We don't have to have a military thing,
because if you can reach people...

01:08:00.034 --> 01:08:03.778
you tend to get more out of them.
That's my philosophy.

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:05.575
Go!

01:08:05.707 --> 01:08:07.539
Yeah, you look good.

01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:10.917
That's not bad at all.

01:08:11.963 --> 01:08:14.421
That was smooth!

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:23.923
We gonna give it to Usain, so whenever
you see him, just present one of these.

01:08:24.058 --> 01:08:26.595
He should be able to solve it
in 30 seconds.

01:08:26.769 --> 01:08:31.685
Here you go, Usain, a token of
my appreciation. Here you go, Mr Bolt.

01:08:31.816 --> 01:08:33.773
It's called a Rubik's Cube.

01:08:33.901 --> 01:08:37.109
A Rubik's Cube. I knew the word.
That was your first test.

01:08:37.238 --> 01:08:38.944
Yeah.

01:08:41.701 --> 01:08:43.363
- Go.
- Can I have a first clue?

01:08:43.493 --> 01:08:44.484
No, you don't.

01:08:44.621 --> 01:08:49.036
Over, over this.
I don't have the first clue.

01:08:50.001 --> 01:08:51.912
People, we are showing the world a secret

01:08:52.045 --> 01:08:56.415
as to why Usain is so cutting edge,
always ahead of the pack.

01:08:56.549 --> 01:08:59.087
No.

01:08:59.218 --> 01:09:00.425
Now I work.

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:06.804
You see with a matter,
if it can be done, Bolt can do it.

01:09:06.934 --> 01:09:09.017
Watch how he broke stuff.

01:09:10.938 --> 01:09:13.350
Evil. Evil.

01:09:14.524 --> 01:09:15.935
But...

01:09:17.654 --> 01:09:19.737
Bolt.

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:23.653
Bolt, this is your answer
to solving the problem.

01:09:23.826 --> 01:09:25.658
It was a good one. It was a good idea.

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:29.993
You see I knew Bolt was like this,
so... I bought two.

01:09:32.794 --> 01:09:34.877
Bolt, are you breathing?

01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:39.339
Yeah.

01:09:41.678 --> 01:09:47.265
I'm a type of person, I get nervous
before my first race, I really do.

01:09:47.392 --> 01:09:51.978
Like, every year my first race I worry,
am I still fast?

01:09:54.899 --> 01:10:00.111
I train well, I execute well in training
but I always worry, am I still fast?

01:10:00.238 --> 01:10:03.402
Am I still the fastest man in the world?

01:10:03.533 --> 01:10:08.073
Am I still this great Usain Bolt?
Every year. I don't know why.

01:10:08.204 --> 01:10:11.788
So my first race right now
I'm always slightly nervous,

01:10:11.916 --> 01:10:14.533
but after the first one
my confidence grows,

01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:17.537
and the more I compete,
the more I get more confident.

01:10:25.722 --> 01:10:27.463
We're in a foreign land.

01:10:30.309 --> 01:10:34.428
It's the start of the season.
I came out for my first race.

01:10:34.564 --> 01:10:37.477
I haven't raced since Beijing.

01:10:37.608 --> 01:10:41.693
I'm just hoping that, after this first
race, I feel like, yeah, this is it.

01:10:41.821 --> 01:10:45.030
The season has started
and I feel like I'm ready to go

01:10:45.158 --> 01:10:47.275
and I'm heading on my way to Rio.

01:10:58.004 --> 01:11:01.964
I've been working hard.
I've had setbacks with my ankle issue.

01:11:02.091 --> 01:11:06.677
But I'm on the right track now
and getting to where I need to be.

01:11:09.223 --> 01:11:11.055
I'm happy that it's time now.

01:11:11.184 --> 01:11:15.428
It's time where it's just going to be
competition. That's what really matters.

01:11:15.563 --> 01:11:19.432
I hate the training part of it,
but I love competing so much.

01:11:19.567 --> 01:11:21.980
Bolt!

01:11:32.747 --> 01:11:35.285
Usain Bolt!

01:12:15.540 --> 01:12:18.658
The start was pretty good, I think,
I think it was an excellent start,

01:12:18.793 --> 01:12:22.707
but when I went to do my transition
and ready to push, I felt my hamstring.

01:12:22.839 --> 01:12:25.957
If it wasn't for that,
I would have ran easy a 9.80.

01:12:28.594 --> 01:12:32.053
50 meters, when I'm coming out
of my drive phase and it's time to go,

01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:36.050
you know what I mean,
that's when I start running, I felt it.

01:12:36.185 --> 01:12:39.519
So then I had to start looking around
to see where I'm at

01:12:39.647 --> 01:12:44.358
because I don't want to push too hard,
you know what I mean?

01:12:44.485 --> 01:12:49.401
And then tear something.
But I don't want to lose either, so...

01:12:51.242 --> 01:12:54.952
I had to make a conscious decision
to get shit right, you know what I mean?

01:12:55.079 --> 01:12:58.197
I'm just too competitive.
I'm just really competitive.

01:12:58.332 --> 01:13:00.824
I take it personally
when I lose to somebody.

01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:05.955
I always go after that person.
I tell myself, you can't beat me again.

01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:09.549
I don't want to lose
at any point in my life.

01:13:13.472 --> 01:13:18.137
The race we were denied last year at the
World Championships, we will get tonight.

01:13:18.269 --> 01:13:22.764
The world champion
vs the Olympic champion. Blake vs Bolt.

01:13:23.691 --> 01:13:27.310
Off they go. Powell is off well.
Bolt has work to do.

01:13:27.445 --> 01:13:29.732
Powell is ahead of Bolt
and the rest of the field.

01:13:29.864 --> 01:13:34.325
Asafa Powell! Blake comes forward
on the outside! Yohan Blake wins!

01:13:34.785 --> 01:13:37.277
I know he wasn't at his best
because I train with him,

01:13:37.413 --> 01:13:39.029
so I know what he was going through.

01:13:39.165 --> 01:13:42.624
The big man Bolt has a platform now

01:13:42.752 --> 01:13:46.666
to restate his dominance
as the world's best.

01:13:46.797 --> 01:13:49.255
I take my 200 meters very personal,

01:13:49.383 --> 01:13:53.423
so for me it was a big deal that
he actually beat me over 200 meters.

01:13:53.554 --> 01:13:55.716
Blake is running well in lane three!

01:13:55.848 --> 01:13:59.808
Bolt is being beaten here by Blake
once again!

01:13:59.936 --> 01:14:04.101
And Yohan Blake,
for the second time in three days,

01:14:04.231 --> 01:14:08.942
delivers a beating on the world's best,
Usain Bolt.

01:14:09.195 --> 01:14:12.108
What counts will be London,
but Blake has to be thrilled

01:14:12.239 --> 01:14:16.279
with his performances
at the nationals this weekend.

01:14:16.410 --> 01:14:19.448
For the next month the work that I put in

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:26.498
to make sure I could silence all
these doubters was just unbelievable.

01:14:26.629 --> 01:14:32.216
I vomited daily because I was
pushing myself to the ultimate level.

01:14:49.986 --> 01:14:52.103
Being great isn't good enough sometimes.

01:14:52.238 --> 01:14:57.609
You have to be better than great
and failure is just not an option.

01:14:57.743 --> 01:15:03.205
At some point, and under those sort
of circumstances, you're just racing.

01:15:03.332 --> 01:15:05.540
You're just racing like we did
when we were kids,

01:15:05.668 --> 01:15:08.536
just, "I am not gonna allow you
to beat me today."

01:15:12.466 --> 01:15:16.301
Everybody who was anybody in that race
was on my left,

01:15:16.429 --> 01:15:17.840
so I didn't have to look right.

01:15:17.972 --> 01:15:22.137
I was, like, you know what, everybody's
on one side of me. This is great.

01:15:23.728 --> 01:15:26.015
On your marks. One deep breath.

01:15:26.689 --> 01:15:30.399
The moment of truth has finally arrived.

01:15:31.444 --> 01:15:35.108
CThe fastest group of sprinters
that has ever taken the line

01:15:35.239 --> 01:15:36.525
in a 100-meter Olympic final.

01:15:36.657 --> 01:15:41.118
God put me on this earth to run,
and that's what I'm gonna do.

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:47.283
Bolt not very quickly out of the blocks,
Powell was the quickest,

01:15:47.418 --> 01:15:49.831
but Bolt just coming into his stride
alongside Gatlin.

01:15:50.046 --> 01:15:53.835
I saw Usain in the peripheral vision.
"Damn, he's coming. He's coming fast."

01:15:53.966 --> 01:15:58.051
When I seen those strides
coming through, bam, bam, bam, hitting,

01:15:58.220 --> 01:15:59.677
I said, "Oh, God."

01:15:59.805 --> 01:16:02.047
In that split second he just fly past.

01:16:02.308 --> 01:16:07.053
And here comes Usain Bolt,
he's pulling away. 9.64!

01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:09.687
The champion becomes a legend.

01:16:10.649 --> 01:16:16.065
Why did we ever doubt
the brilliance of Usain Bolt?

01:16:16.197 --> 01:16:18.940
Beijing was, you know, off the planet,

01:16:19.075 --> 01:16:23.740
but actually it was London, I think,
that established him for all time.

01:16:23.871 --> 01:16:29.412
I don't think I can remember anybody
since Muhammad Ali

01:16:29.543 --> 01:16:36.040
that has just grabbed the stage
in any sport in the way Usain has.

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:45.264
So, on the day, 100 is for my coach,
that's how we do it,

01:16:45.392 --> 01:16:48.100
100 meters for my coach,
the 200 is for me,

01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:52.269
so he didn't say absolutely nothing
to me when it comes to the 200 meters.

01:16:52.399 --> 01:16:54.436
He was like, "Go get 'em, champ."

01:16:58.364 --> 01:17:00.856
Came out. I know I had more energy

01:17:00.991 --> 01:17:05.031
because I had more confidence,
so everything was smoother, I was happy.

01:17:09.291 --> 01:17:12.329
I remember doing some stride out
and Warren Weir was in front of me,

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:15.875
and I said to Warren,
"I'm gonna run past you pretty fast."

01:17:16.006 --> 01:17:21.297
"Do not try to run me down. You run
your own race and you'll be fine."

01:17:24.431 --> 01:17:26.673
- Shh.
- On your marks.

01:17:26.809 --> 01:17:29.722
Everyone was like, "Yo, are you ready?
Feel like you're ready?"

01:17:29.854 --> 01:17:31.971
I'm, like, yo,
I'm so ready for these finals.

01:17:38.112 --> 01:17:40.900
I remember coming off the corner.
I looked. I could see him.

01:17:41.031 --> 01:17:45.275
I was, like, "Usain, you cannot let
Blake come off this corner before you."

01:17:45.411 --> 01:17:47.744
It was like I found another gear
cos I started digging.

01:17:50.749 --> 01:17:52.615
When I got to the finish line,

01:17:52.751 --> 01:17:55.710
I remember Blake doing something
at the national trials,

01:17:55.838 --> 01:17:58.171
he went like this after the race,

01:17:58.299 --> 01:18:01.838
and when I was going through the line, I
went like this and I was looking at him.

01:18:01.969 --> 01:18:04.507
I was letting him know that,
listen, I'm still number one.

01:18:04.638 --> 01:18:08.427
You're my teammate, and I respect you,
but I'm the greatest.

01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:11.302
You know, I was a bit naive. I was young.

01:18:11.437 --> 01:18:14.896
It was a bit of, you know,
rivalry between me and Bolt.

01:18:15.024 --> 01:18:17.687
We tried to play that down
and just go on the track and have fun

01:18:17.818 --> 01:18:21.437
and, you know,
he was just the better man on the day.

01:18:21.572 --> 01:18:25.486
And then we found out
that Warren actually came third.

01:18:29.705 --> 01:18:31.867
And then it was like
an even bigger celebration now

01:18:31.999 --> 01:18:33.991
because it was one, two, three.

01:18:34.126 --> 01:18:35.583
It was a great feat for my coach,

01:18:35.711 --> 01:18:38.920
and Jamaica was going ecstatic
because of one, two, three.

01:18:39.048 --> 01:18:40.289
You should have heard them.

01:18:54.063 --> 01:18:56.555
You've got Tyson Gay versus Yohan Blake

01:18:56.690 --> 01:18:57.931
and Blake's winning this one.

01:18:58.067 --> 01:18:59.899
Here comes Usain Bolt,

01:19:00.027 --> 01:19:02.360
and Usain Bolt is moving away.

01:19:02.488 --> 01:19:04.855
36.85!

01:19:04.990 --> 01:19:09.234
World record for Usain Bolt and Jamaica.

01:19:15.626 --> 01:19:21.463
So there's two screens. One here,
and there's one across the road.

01:19:25.719 --> 01:19:29.713
- I'm gonna try experience it myself.
- Always epic.

01:19:31.267 --> 01:19:33.259
I can just imagine the energy.

01:19:33.394 --> 01:19:35.260
- Just seeing that, full stop.
- Loud.

01:19:35.437 --> 01:19:38.271
Everybody just stop in one place.
Would be nice.

01:19:40.985 --> 01:19:46.276
Usain Bolt has represented Jamaica
in a modern era.

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:50.408
In a time when there was nobody
bearing the banner of Jamaica

01:19:50.536 --> 01:19:55.577
and carrying Jamaica on them shoulder,
and he did all up.

01:19:58.127 --> 01:20:03.748
When you see him live and what he do,
and what he does on the spare time,

01:20:03.882 --> 01:20:07.000
definitely the new generation
of Jamaica, you know,

01:20:07.136 --> 01:20:11.005
so you can still be yourself
and achieve what you need to achieve

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:13.632
without losing who you are,
without losing your identity.

01:20:13.767 --> 01:20:15.929
That's what I respect most about Usain.

01:20:16.061 --> 01:20:18.303
Him keep it real, you know,
as them sayin'.

01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:26.862
I think Bolt is a shining example
of the best that we can be as Jamaicans.

01:20:26.989 --> 01:20:30.858
Out of the belly of rural Jamaica

01:20:30.993 --> 01:20:36.534
to becoming a face recognized
in any corner of the world.

01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:39.203
It's absolutely a phenomenal feat.

01:20:43.088 --> 01:20:45.831
Yo! Yo, yo, yo, yo!

01:20:46.592 --> 01:20:49.130
A Jamaican hero and always our hero.

01:20:49.261 --> 01:20:51.878
He's well beloved by everybody
all over the world,

01:20:52.014 --> 01:20:54.927
especially Jamaica,
cos we are proud of him.

01:21:17.539 --> 01:21:21.909
So we're now start of July.
It's the Olympic trials for Jamaica.

01:21:22.044 --> 01:21:23.535
Every athlete has to qualify here,

01:21:23.670 --> 01:21:27.789
so normally it's top two, top three
gets selected on the team.

01:21:27.925 --> 01:21:30.759
Two weeks ago
we had a Racers Track Club meet.

01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:34.004
Usain won the 100 meters there
and he looked very comfortable.

01:21:34.139 --> 01:21:35.801
He's down at the line and still had 9.88.

01:21:35.933 --> 01:21:37.925
Bolt made that look pretty easy.

01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:41.804
In lane four, Asafa Powell.

01:21:45.401 --> 01:21:47.063
Yohan Blake.

01:21:52.408 --> 01:21:54.070
Usain Bolt.

01:21:54.201 --> 01:21:56.284
The season's gone pretty well for Usain.

01:21:56.412 --> 01:21:58.244
He hasn't ran really fast yet,

01:21:58.372 --> 01:22:01.285
but you would say if he ran full out
and that the race went well,

01:22:01.417 --> 01:22:04.251
he could run 9.70 right now.

01:22:04.378 --> 01:22:05.914
But, of course, he has to do it.

01:22:06.046 --> 01:22:07.253
Set.

01:23:11.028 --> 01:23:14.647
Yesterday they get us all up,
we had to get us all up,

01:23:14.781 --> 01:23:19.367
and they send us out there and,
as professionals, I'm not used to that.

01:23:19.495 --> 01:23:23.739
The first race was at seven
and I was in the last heat,

01:23:23.874 --> 01:23:26.662
and I was out there just watching
the races, you know what I mean,

01:23:26.793 --> 01:23:31.504
trying to stay warm,
and then my race false started.

01:23:36.428 --> 01:23:38.920
And when I actually ran the race,

01:23:39.056 --> 01:23:42.891
I felt my hamstring like
in the Cayman Islands, I had that issue,

01:23:43.018 --> 01:23:47.388
and I feel it was the fact that we were
out there so long and I got cold and...

01:23:47.523 --> 01:23:50.266
So it was just...
I was just annoyed and frustrated

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:55.816
about the whole organization
of the meet and the trial,

01:23:55.948 --> 01:23:58.440
so I'm not happy and I complain.

01:24:00.744 --> 01:24:04.533
I'm used to being sent out
at a timely fashion.

01:24:12.798 --> 01:24:16.087
- How was your semi today?
- It's not so bad.

01:24:16.218 --> 01:24:18.301
- I think it's easily a ten.
- Ten-one?

01:24:18.428 --> 01:24:19.919
The guys were going for under nines?

01:24:20.055 --> 01:24:23.890
I've not... Listen, I'm not pulling past
anybody. We'll see what they do.

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:29.891
So the good thing about Usain

01:24:30.023 --> 01:24:35.314
is he likes to give me a couple
of watches to take away each time.

01:24:35.445 --> 01:24:37.186
This one I think I'll have this time.

01:24:37.322 --> 01:24:40.815
- Lies.
- Thank you, sir. Looks good on me.

01:24:43.870 --> 01:24:47.204
Yep, someone leaves them in hotel rooms
every now and again.

01:24:47.332 --> 01:24:48.948
Was one, bruv, one.

01:24:49.084 --> 01:24:51.918
- Jesus, man, one watch.
- Yup.

01:24:59.595 --> 01:25:02.429
Usain Bolt!

01:25:05.517 --> 01:25:10.558
In lane number one,
his time 10. 15 seconds as well...

01:25:58.737 --> 01:26:03.107
- Coach. It's 50/50, you know.
- You feel it again?

01:26:03.241 --> 01:26:06.530
Yeah, but this time
I'm trying not to push as hard.

01:26:06.662 --> 01:26:09.746
It don't make sense to push it.

01:26:09.873 --> 01:26:12.411
I'm over by the warm-up area.

01:26:12.542 --> 01:26:13.999
But...

01:26:15.545 --> 01:26:17.537
I need you to...

01:26:17.673 --> 01:26:23.214
I need to get a waiver, because
Usain can't run cos of this hamstring.

01:26:27.224 --> 01:26:29.307
What the plan, Coach?

01:26:32.062 --> 01:26:37.057
Me call Dr. Bruce,
tell him to come over. Relax.

01:27:06.930 --> 01:27:09.593
Last night, him aggravate it,

01:27:09.725 --> 01:27:14.470
so I'm concerned it's getting...
it's deteriorating, so...

01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:20.191
I wanna pull him from the final,
from the race.

01:27:28.285 --> 01:27:34.907
So, according to the rules, you have
to report it to the medical team.

01:27:43.592 --> 01:27:45.458
Unfortunately, Usain had to pull out

01:27:45.594 --> 01:27:47.381
of the final of the 100 meters
in the trials,

01:27:47.512 --> 01:27:50.630
so we got it checked out
by the chief medical officer

01:27:50.766 --> 01:27:52.883
and it was determined
that he had a strain in there

01:27:53.018 --> 01:27:54.930
and it would be dangerous for him to run,

01:27:55.061 --> 01:27:57.018
so we've submitted
a medical exemption form.

01:27:57.147 --> 01:28:00.766
You know, we're hoping that
he can be selected based on that.

01:28:00.901 --> 01:28:02.984
He definitely was disappointed.

01:28:03.111 --> 01:28:06.195
He was quiet last night.
It's frustrating for him.

01:28:06.323 --> 01:28:09.361
Injuries have been the thing
that held him back his whole career.

01:28:09.659 --> 01:28:13.278
I would say injuries have been
his biggest rival throughout his career,

01:28:13.413 --> 01:28:16.326
so for it to come at this time
isn't ideal,

01:28:16.458 --> 01:28:18.575
but I think he knows how to deal with it.

01:28:18.710 --> 01:28:19.917
Hopefully today or tomorrow

01:28:20.045 --> 01:28:22.287
he's a little bit more positive
about the situation,

01:28:22.422 --> 01:28:24.789
but until we go
to Dr. Muller-Wohlfahrt in Germany

01:28:24.925 --> 01:28:28.589
and he, you know, does a scan and a full
assessment, we'll not know for sure.

01:28:44.152 --> 01:28:48.112
What pissed me off, they were saying,
"Usain always does this."

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:50.823
I'm like, do what?

01:28:50.951 --> 01:28:54.115
I beat these guys day in, day out,
every day of the week,

01:28:54.246 --> 01:28:59.583
so for them to say, talk like,
oh, I'm chickening out from a race,

01:28:59.709 --> 01:29:02.247
you know what I mean, it's insulting.

01:29:03.839 --> 01:29:05.831
I've never really disrespected 'em
like that.

01:29:05.966 --> 01:29:07.707
Always Justin Gatlin,
you know what I mean?

01:29:07.843 --> 01:29:10.051
I've beaten him many times. He's nobody.

01:29:10.178 --> 01:29:13.717
I've never said these things
cos I give every athlete a respect,

01:29:13.849 --> 01:29:16.262
and especially the little one,
even Rodgers.

01:29:16.393 --> 01:29:18.976
Get an individual gold medal,
that's what I'm thinking,

01:29:19.104 --> 01:29:21.847
before you even have a conversation
about my name.

01:29:22.023 --> 01:29:26.108
You have never won an individual gold
medal or a silver medal or any medal,

01:29:26.236 --> 01:29:29.354
you know what I mean, and you're gonna
have a conversation about me?

01:29:30.490 --> 01:29:32.652
I've built this sport,
you know what I mean?

01:29:32.784 --> 01:29:35.993
You guys have been through so many drugs
charges and so many drugs things,

01:29:36.121 --> 01:29:39.740
I've never pointed the finger and say,
"These guys are making the sports bad."

01:29:39.875 --> 01:29:42.709
If you cross the line,
I'm gonna cross the line too,

01:29:42.836 --> 01:29:45.374
because I think I'm one of
the nicest guys on the circuit.

01:29:45.505 --> 01:29:48.213
I've always shown people respect,
so it pisses me off.

01:29:51.094 --> 01:29:54.212
Last season was one of
the most horrifying seasons of my life,

01:29:54.347 --> 01:29:58.933
and getting to Beijing, I wasn't
in the shape that I wanted to be.

01:29:59.102 --> 01:30:01.810
So going into that race,
it was pretty much a dog fight,

01:30:01.938 --> 01:30:05.181
it's like I'm out there just
for my life, you know what I mean?

01:30:05.317 --> 01:30:09.527
We're going in the biggest race of your
life right now to defend your glory,

01:30:09.654 --> 01:30:13.364
cos being undefeated in the championship
is everything for me.

01:30:13.491 --> 01:30:16.700
That's my legacy that I have
and I have to defend.

01:30:16.828 --> 01:30:19.366
So this season is not gonna be
like last season,

01:30:19.497 --> 01:30:21.784
not gonna be one of those races
where everybody's like,

01:30:21.917 --> 01:30:24.079
"Oh, my God, is Usain Bolt gonna win?"

01:30:24.210 --> 01:30:27.578
And this year I'm a little bit more
angry also, you know what I mean?

01:30:27.714 --> 01:30:30.923
I'm a little bit more ticked off about
things these guys have been saying,

01:30:31.051 --> 01:30:34.169
so it's not gonna be the same.

01:30:34.304 --> 01:30:36.387
I'm gonna...

01:30:37.933 --> 01:30:39.595
It's not gonna be the same.

01:30:47.984 --> 01:30:51.148
I don't think we'll ever see anyone,
certainly not in my lifetime,

01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:53.396
who'll be able to win three Olympic Games

01:30:53.531 --> 01:30:55.818
in the 100 meters, 200 meters
and the four by one.

01:30:55.951 --> 01:30:59.410
I think it will be one of the greatest
achievements in the history of sport.

01:31:10.590 --> 01:31:13.503
When you think of Usain Bolt,
you're definitely gonna have to think of

01:31:13.635 --> 01:31:17.754
the Muhammad Alis, the Pelé,
the Michael Jordans.

01:31:17.889 --> 01:31:21.348
Like, amazing athletes
that's reached beyond

01:31:21.476 --> 01:31:23.809
what any other athlete has reached,

01:31:23.937 --> 01:31:26.099
Serena Williamses, it's just those names,

01:31:26.231 --> 01:31:28.188
Usain Bolt goes right in there.

01:31:40.996 --> 01:31:42.612
He is one of my idols.

01:31:43.707 --> 01:31:47.826
I hope he doesn't run
against a Brazilian in Rio.

01:31:47.961 --> 01:31:50.669
Then I'm going to suffer.

01:31:53.758 --> 01:31:56.751
It will be hard not to support Usain Bolt.

01:31:56.886 --> 01:32:02.257
There will be a lot of Brazilians
supporting him. He is an icon, an idol.

01:32:05.770 --> 01:32:09.434
Getting to the championship,
it's distraction, it's injuries,

01:32:09.566 --> 01:32:12.900
but for whatever reason,
when he gets to the championship,

01:32:13.028 --> 01:32:15.065
he's just a different animal.

01:32:16.614 --> 01:32:20.449
Usain, two days out from the hundred,
how are you feeling?

01:32:33.048 --> 01:32:34.539
Will you give us a photograph?

01:32:36.801 --> 01:32:39.043
The moment we've all been waiting for now.

01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:42.213
Please welcome the main man. Usain Bolt.

01:32:48.813 --> 01:32:50.930
It's not been the perfect build-up,
has it?

01:32:51.066 --> 01:32:52.773
How worried should people be?

01:32:52.901 --> 01:32:54.608
Are you afraid of losing?

01:32:54.736 --> 01:32:57.854
How ready are you to defend your titles?

01:33:00.617 --> 01:33:04.236
How sure are you that the sprint
races that you'll be involved in

01:33:04.370 --> 01:33:06.578
will be free of drugs?

01:33:06.706 --> 01:33:08.493
How does athletics,

01:33:08.625 --> 01:33:11.538
even the Olympic movement,
survive without Usain Bolt?

01:33:11.669 --> 01:33:13.911
What does that make you feel?

01:33:14.047 --> 01:33:16.380
These your last games? How does it feel?

01:33:16.508 --> 01:33:20.878
Is that sad to think about? Is it
emotional? Or are you just excited?

01:33:25.725 --> 01:33:29.719
How do you deal with this pressure
to always be the best,

01:33:29.854 --> 01:33:31.766
to always be the fastest?

01:33:32.524 --> 01:33:36.108
If you wanna be obsessed,
be obsessed about after the gun,

01:33:36.277 --> 01:33:38.815
what technical...

01:33:41.449 --> 01:33:44.442
What kind of questions
are you tired of getting asked?

01:33:44.577 --> 01:33:49.038
I don't know. I think I've been asked
so much questions, it's hard to say.

01:33:49.165 --> 01:33:51.407
I think it's just
when it's mostly after...

01:33:51.543 --> 01:33:53.284
- Sorry, sorry.
- In the light.

01:33:56.089 --> 01:33:58.627
He always stays in the Athletes' Village
with the team.

01:33:58.758 --> 01:34:01.751
He loves the team environment.
That gives him energy.

01:34:01.886 --> 01:34:05.345
He doesn't need a lot.
It's a spartan existence.

01:34:05.473 --> 01:34:09.092
He just needs to sleep, train, eat
and prepare for the race.

01:34:13.523 --> 01:34:16.015
He gets this dormant quietness about him.

01:34:18.361 --> 01:34:21.354
I think he's going through everything
in his head.

01:34:21.489 --> 01:34:24.948
All the vulnerabilities, insecurities,
game plans, race plans.

01:34:26.452 --> 01:34:29.945
And then he gives us
the bravado, the smile.

01:34:30.081 --> 01:34:33.415
The pose. The rest is history.

01:34:39.966 --> 01:34:41.002
Show people.

01:34:41.134 --> 01:34:42.341
Lots of grey hair, man.

01:34:42.468 --> 01:34:46.007
Look right here, people. See?

01:34:46.139 --> 01:34:47.630
Your head bald, man.

01:34:54.022 --> 01:34:56.059
Hey, don't take off the moustache.
Just leave...

01:34:56.191 --> 01:34:58.649
Take off everything, Kettle,
and just leave a moustache.

01:34:58.776 --> 01:35:01.063
- Don't worry about that.
- You can look for yourself.

01:35:01.196 --> 01:35:03.062
I'd look like a police.

01:35:06.784 --> 01:35:08.867
We have danced...

01:35:10.788 --> 01:35:14.498
Tomorrow, aerodynamic.
Yeah, let's dance, the people.

01:35:14.626 --> 01:35:16.834
Oh, yeah, freshness.

01:35:16.961 --> 01:35:18.452
Off to the block.

01:35:21.049 --> 01:35:23.132
Yo. Almost did.

01:35:26.971 --> 01:35:29.463
I was there, I was there,
I was there. I was there.

01:35:29.599 --> 01:35:31.966
Honestly, I was there. I was there.

01:35:32.101 --> 01:35:34.718
Yo, that's the '08... Yo, yo...

01:35:34.854 --> 01:35:39.144
Yo, that's the 2008 edition. Ali!

01:35:43.988 --> 01:35:48.107
So I'm about to go to bed.
Got my fresh cut today.

01:35:48.243 --> 01:35:50.906
First round is tomorrow.
I'm looking forward to it.

01:35:51.037 --> 01:35:53.871
Am I nervous? Just a little bit.

01:35:53.998 --> 01:35:56.661
But the more I run,
the more I feel better.

01:36:00.672 --> 01:36:03.005
Watch out. There's gonna be fire.

01:36:03.883 --> 01:36:05.715
Peace.

01:37:33.056 --> 01:37:41.055
From Jamaica, reigning Olympic
World Champion, Usain Bolt.

01:37:48.279 --> 01:37:50.646
Came off of the semi-finals, I felt great.

01:37:50.782 --> 01:37:53.650
In warming up I felt quick,
felt light on my feet.

01:37:54.369 --> 01:37:57.487
Oh! Fisher.

01:38:04.253 --> 01:38:05.243
Fisher.

01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:08.999
Usain Bolt knows
what it's like to be disqualified.

01:38:10.426 --> 01:38:14.921
Bolt. Is this
going to be the biggest challenge...

01:38:15.056 --> 01:38:17.890
I came out here and I got a flyer,

01:38:18.017 --> 01:38:21.556
I got the best start
I've ever gotten in a long while,

01:38:21.687 --> 01:38:26.648
and I ran to about 40 meters,
and when I came out of my drive phase,

01:38:26.776 --> 01:38:29.610
I was alongside everybody
and pulling away.

01:38:31.447 --> 01:38:34.110
Perfect picture, you know what I mean?
Bright smile.

01:38:34.242 --> 01:38:39.078
It looked like I was actually looking
into the camera and, like, smiling.

01:38:39.205 --> 01:38:40.741
There was something in that smile.

01:38:42.875 --> 01:38:45.618
Oh, shit.

01:39:10.486 --> 01:39:12.694
This guy is without doubt

01:39:12.822 --> 01:39:15.940
the greatest sprinter
the world has ever seen.

01:39:16.075 --> 01:39:22.447
We know this is going to be his last
appearance at an Olympic Games.

01:39:24.459 --> 01:39:28.954
And surely a hat-trick of golds
over the 100 meters

01:39:29.088 --> 01:39:34.334
would be a feat never to be repeated,
certainly not in lifetimes.

01:39:55.448 --> 01:39:57.110
Set.

01:40:17.470 --> 01:40:19.632
I was born to be an athlete.

01:40:19.764 --> 01:40:22.882
I think it was just my moment
and I was always gonna do great.

01:40:23.017 --> 01:40:26.636
I want to be remembered
among the great athletes in the world.

01:40:26.771 --> 01:40:28.137
I want people to talk about me

01:40:28.272 --> 01:40:32.937
when they talk about Muhammad Ali
and Pelé and all these guys.

01:40:39.784 --> 01:40:42.322
He's immortal now.

01:40:42.453 --> 01:40:47.539
All the way from Beijing to London
and now to Rio.

01:40:48.584 --> 01:40:53.454
It is one of the greatest
athletic achievements of all time.

01:40:55.675 --> 01:40:57.416
When Usain Bolt win the race,

01:40:57.552 --> 01:41:00.420
the whole world feel like they win a race.

01:41:00.555 --> 01:41:02.592
That I can't explain.

01:41:03.849 --> 01:41:06.182
Number one on there today. Remember that.

01:41:07.186 --> 01:41:12.102
Yo, when you wake up
and you feel like a million dollars

01:41:12.233 --> 01:41:17.695
and you remember that you're Olympic
three-time 100-meter champion,

01:41:17.822 --> 01:41:19.313
it's a good feeling.

01:41:20.157 --> 01:41:22.240
Two more to go, baby. Yeah!

01:41:23.703 --> 01:41:26.446
You're from other countries
and you're rooting for your country,

01:41:26.581 --> 01:41:29.369
but then you see Bolt and you're like,
"OK, I'm rooting for Bolt."

01:41:30.876 --> 01:41:33.118
Everyone wanted to see Bolt run,

01:41:33.254 --> 01:41:36.622
and that's something that, you know,
just doesn't happen.

01:41:36.799 --> 01:41:38.586
No one knows what nine-five feels like,

01:41:38.759 --> 01:41:40.842
no one knows what it is to run
in the Olympic Games,

01:41:40.970 --> 01:41:43.132
but for some reason
when he steps on the line,

01:41:43.264 --> 01:41:45.756
you feel like you're running with him.

01:41:50.271 --> 01:41:52.809
I have no doubt
that you'll have a faster runner

01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:54.602
than Usain Bolt in the future,

01:41:54.734 --> 01:41:58.398
but the world
will always remember Usain Bolt.

01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:08.488
The last three Olympics
have been amazing with Usain,

01:42:08.623 --> 01:42:12.242
um... and he really went out in style,
you know.

01:42:12.376 --> 01:42:15.540
He's the best athlete
who's ever lived by far

01:42:15.671 --> 01:42:17.253
and he proved that again tonight.

01:42:19.133 --> 01:42:24.299
A youth who was born relatively poor,
in terms of economics,

01:42:24.430 --> 01:42:31.018
but was rich, was rich with talent,
rich with life, rich with substance.

01:42:31.145 --> 01:42:35.640
And to see somebody like that
rise to win an Olympic gold medal,

01:42:35.816 --> 01:42:38.809
like, that's what the world needed.

01:42:41.405 --> 01:42:46.776
I found the drive and I was relentless
in wanting to become the greatest.

01:42:46.911 --> 01:42:48.652
So for me it's like...

01:42:50.706 --> 01:42:52.663
I found it, I did it.

01:42:52.792 --> 01:42:57.253
It took a lot of hard work and guts
and focus and concentration.

01:42:58.923 --> 01:43:02.132
It's not easy.
People feel like it's simple.

01:43:02.259 --> 01:43:06.048
And I have to remind myself that,
listen, you have a goal for yourself,

01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:11.016
and if you don't win this year, all that
you've done doesn't really matter,

01:43:11.143 --> 01:43:13.556
and that's one of the things
that kept me going.

01:43:13.688 --> 01:43:16.396
Running in lane four, it's Jamaica.

01:43:16.524 --> 01:43:20.689
Big up to Usain.
Definitely he is a legend.

01:43:21.570 --> 01:43:24.529
It's a great feeling being, you know,
his friend and his teammate.

01:43:25.950 --> 01:43:28.442
And we did it for him,
tonight was for him.

01:43:28.577 --> 01:43:31.445
I think they should just give him
the stadium, take it back to Jamaica,

01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:33.071
take it wherever he wants, you know?

01:43:33.207 --> 01:43:34.573
What is there still to give him?

01:43:36.210 --> 01:43:39.078
To come and do something like that,
getting nine gold medals,

01:43:39.213 --> 01:43:40.749
that has been magical.

01:43:42.299 --> 01:43:45.508
He's up there with the big guys.
He's sitting at the table.

01:43:56.397 --> 01:44:00.107
It is a dream of every coach
to have a talented athlete,

01:44:00.234 --> 01:44:05.696
and to have one as talented as Bolt
is extra special.

01:44:09.368 --> 01:44:11.735
To see this child I grew up with,

01:44:11.871 --> 01:44:18.118
this boy influencing the world
the way he has, is special.

01:44:19.170 --> 01:44:21.002
It gives you a sense of purpose.

01:44:21.130 --> 01:44:23.964
Like you have contributed
to something great.

01:44:26.093 --> 01:44:31.339
Cos he ain't here trying to be
political or revolutionary.

01:44:31.474 --> 01:44:35.309
His whole quest
is to just make people smile.

01:44:35.436 --> 01:44:38.224
Probably that's why
the world responds to him so much.

01:44:38.355 --> 01:44:42.099
At a time when the world is in chaos,
he's just all about smiling.

01:44:42.234 --> 01:44:45.944
For nine seconds,
let's just put the runner euphorically.

01:44:48.365 --> 01:44:51.073
I've dedicated all my life
to being the best,

01:44:51.202 --> 01:44:54.411
and to being the best track and field
person I can possibly be,

01:44:54.538 --> 01:44:56.530
trying to be a legend,
trying to be the greatest,

01:44:56.665 --> 01:44:59.578
trying to be unstoppable,
trying to be undefeated.

01:44:59.710 --> 01:45:01.542
I've dedicated my life to this.

01:45:02.087 --> 01:45:06.377
If I was an emotional guy,
right now I'd be crying for sure,

01:45:06.509 --> 01:45:08.501
because it's been such a long journey,

01:45:08.636 --> 01:45:13.256
and now, for me,
it's like... it's finally over.

01:45:13.390 --> 01:45:17.225
I'm sad, but I'm relieved that it's over.

01:45:17.353 --> 01:45:21.188
I've done it. I've done
what I've set out to do in the sport.

01:45:21.315 --> 01:45:25.480
I'm just happy this part of...
this chapter is closed

01:45:25.611 --> 01:45:29.070
and I can just relax
and just go on vacation,

01:45:29.198 --> 01:45:33.317
not worrying about anything,
eat some junk food and just live.

01:45:34.870 --> 01:45:36.862
Yo.

01:45:37.039 --> 01:45:39.076
The greatest, the greatest.

01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:47.497
I am the greatest. Remember that. I am.

01:45:53.556 --> 01:45:56.094
Listen... So we had a bet.

01:45:57.434 --> 01:46:01.394
Everybody's been talking
all kind of crap all season.

01:46:01.522 --> 01:46:06.642
All stuff about I can't throw 60 meters.
Well, it's gonna go down right now.

01:46:08.529 --> 01:46:10.486
Yo, where's the tape?

01:46:10.614 --> 01:46:13.527
No chance, no chance.

01:46:18.247 --> 01:46:23.242
Can you believe that the last event
I'm gonna be doing at the Olympics

01:46:23.377 --> 01:46:26.040
is javelin?

01:46:26.171 --> 01:46:31.007
No one knew. It's a beautiful moment.
Let's do this.

01:46:33.679 --> 01:46:40.768
Bolt, Bolt, Bolt, Bolt, Bolt, Bolt,
Bolt, Bolt, Bolt...
