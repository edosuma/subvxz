WEBVTT

00:07.923 --> 00:09.999
The reading's growing
stronger, Captain.

00:10.175 --> 00:13.425
Coming from a star system
directly ahead.

00:14.596 --> 00:16.221
It's not a signal, sir.

00:16.390 --> 00:20.767
It does not seem to even exist,
and yet it's affecting all my channels.

00:22.688 --> 00:23.933
Well?

00:24.440 --> 00:28.568
Someone or something is attempting
to attract our attention.

00:28.736 --> 00:31.571
Someone or something
has succeeded.

00:31.739 --> 00:33.566
Our distress signal relays
have been activated.

00:33.741 --> 00:36.279
We've been given a direction
to follow, but how?

00:36.453 --> 00:39.122
- What's causing it?
- I do not know.

00:40.415 --> 00:43.499
Not even a Vulcan can know
the unknown, Captain.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.786
We are hundreds of light years past

00:45.962 --> 00:48.169
where any Earth ship
has ever explored.

00:48.340 --> 00:51.294
Planet dead ahead, Captain.
Becoming visual.

00:55.139 --> 00:58.140
- Class-M planet, Captain.
- Close to Earth conditions.

00:58.309 --> 01:01.512
With two very important exceptions.
It is much older than Earth,

01:01.687 --> 01:03.312
and about a half million years ago,

01:03.481 --> 01:06.398
its atmosphere was totally ripped away
by some sort of cataclysm.

01:06.776 --> 01:09.232
The planet has evidently
been dead since then.

01:09.404 --> 01:11.480
Sensors detect no life of any kind.

01:11.823 --> 01:16.401
All your questions will be answered
in time, Captain Kirk.

01:19.748 --> 01:22.665
- Are your hailing frequencies open?
- No, sir.

01:22.834 --> 01:24.708
I am Sargon.

01:24.878 --> 01:28.128
It is the energy of my thoughts
which has touched your instruments

01:28.298 --> 01:30.090
and directed you here.

01:30.259 --> 01:33.924
Now, at this closer distance,
I can speak to you at last.

01:34.096 --> 01:35.674
Who are you, Sargon?

01:35.848 --> 01:39.299
Please assume a standard orbit
about our planet, Captain.

01:39.477 --> 01:41.350
Is that a request or demand?

01:41.520 --> 01:43.180
The choice is yours.

01:43.356 --> 01:47.982
I read what is in your mind.
Words are unnecessary.

01:48.152 --> 01:49.812
The planet is dead.

01:49.988 --> 01:53.154
There's no possibility of life there
as we understand life.

01:53.324 --> 01:57.536
And I am as dead as my planet.

01:59.247 --> 02:03.541
Does that frighten you, James Kirk?
For if it does,

02:03.710 --> 02:07.044
if you let what is left of me perish,

02:07.214 --> 02:09.705
then all of you, my children,

02:09.883 --> 02:14.925
all of mankind must perish too.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:28.736 --> 02:32.070
Space, the final frontier.

02:37.579 --> 02:42.040
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

02:42.209 --> 02:45.957
Its five-year mission:
To explore strange, new worlds,

02:46.129 --> 02:49.962
to seek out new life
and new civilizations,

02:50.134 --> 02:53.135
to boldly go
where no man has gone before.

03:34.472 --> 03:37.757
Captain's Log. Stardate 4768.3.

03:37.934 --> 03:40.057
The Enterprise is in orbit
above a planet

03:40.228 --> 03:43.976
whose surface, our sensors tell us,
is devoid of all life.

03:44.148 --> 03:47.980
A world destroyed and dead
for at least a half million years,

03:48.278 --> 03:52.322
yet from it comes a voice,
the energy of pure thought,

03:52.490 --> 03:56.868
telling us something has survived
here for those thousands of centuries.

03:57.120 --> 04:01.284
Since exploration and contact with alien
intelligence is our primary mission,

04:01.458 --> 04:06.500
I've decided to risk the potential
dangers and resume contact.

04:06.672 --> 04:08.214
Log entry out.

04:08.424 --> 04:11.045
How long before Starfleet
receives that?

04:11.218 --> 04:13.341
Over three weeks
at this distance, sir.

04:13.512 --> 04:14.841
Captain.

04:17.308 --> 04:18.553
Got something?

04:18.726 --> 04:22.344
Sensors registering some form
of energy deep inside the planet.

04:22.522 --> 04:25.274
Your probes have
touched me, Mr. Spock.

04:26.901 --> 04:29.855
Reading energy only, Captain.
No life forms.

04:30.030 --> 04:33.862
I have locked your transporter device
on my coordinates.

04:34.034 --> 04:37.866
Please come to us.
Rescue us from oblivion.

04:38.038 --> 04:41.988
Coming from deep under
the planet surface, Captain...

04:42.584 --> 04:46.914
...under at least 100 miles
of solid rock.

04:47.298 --> 04:50.049
I will make it possible
for your transporter

04:50.217 --> 04:54.511
to beam you that deep
beneath the surface. Have no fear.

04:55.640 --> 04:57.763
Reading a chamber now.

04:57.934 --> 05:03.521
Oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere,
suitable for human life support.

05:04.524 --> 05:07.774
Lieutenant Uhura, have Dr. McCoy
report to the Transporter Room

05:07.944 --> 05:11.194
in 10 minutes with standard
landing-party equipment.

05:11.364 --> 05:12.396
Yes, sir.

05:12.574 --> 05:15.147
- Spock.
- Captain. Captain,

05:15.327 --> 05:18.696
I do wish to inspect whatever this is
that lived that long ago.

05:18.872 --> 05:23.250
And I'd want my Science Officer with
me on something as unusual as this,

05:23.419 --> 05:27.915
but it is full of unknowns, and we can't
risk both of us being off the ship.

05:30.760 --> 05:32.551
All power gone, sir.

05:35.473 --> 05:41.143
On the other hand, perhaps this
Sargon would like you to come with us.

05:42.605 --> 05:46.188
- Fascinating.
- All normal. No damage at all.

05:46.776 --> 05:48.484
I see.

05:50.614 --> 05:53.365
Will you transport
down with us, Mr. Spock?

05:53.533 --> 05:57.697
- Evidently, Captain.
- Mr. Sulu, you have the conn.

06:04.545 --> 06:07.499
Why no briefing on this? I'd at least
like to know what we're getting into.

06:07.673 --> 06:09.796
Easy. As long as you know
there's something down there

06:09.967 --> 06:11.960
you know as much as we do.
The rest is only guesses.

06:12.136 --> 06:13.381
I don't like it, sir.

06:13.554 --> 06:18.845
The transporter coordinates preset
by an alien of some sort.

06:19.018 --> 06:21.936
You could materialize
inside solid rock.

06:23.189 --> 06:26.143
- Inside solid rock?
- Unlikely.

06:26.317 --> 06:30.066
These coordinates correspond with the
location of the subterranean chamber.

06:30.238 --> 06:33.654
I have a feeling that they, or it,

06:33.825 --> 06:38.534
could destroy us just standing here
if they or it wanted to.

06:38.705 --> 06:40.615
"They or it"?

06:50.676 --> 06:54.591
- Who are you?
- Dr. Ann Mulhall, Astrobiology.

06:56.349 --> 07:00.050
Well, I was ordered to report here
for landing-party duty.

07:00.228 --> 07:02.185
By whom?

07:03.440 --> 07:06.191
Strange. I'm not sure.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.186
Well, I'm not a liar, Captain.

07:10.363 --> 07:13.151
I did receive an order
to report here for duty.

07:13.325 --> 07:17.786
I'm sure she did, Captain, just as you
received an order to bring me along.

07:20.082 --> 07:21.742
Oh, yes.

07:24.044 --> 07:26.084
Let's get back to this
solid rock business.

07:26.255 --> 07:28.212
Just how much rock
are we going to go through?

07:28.382 --> 07:32.214
Approximately 112.37 miles, doctor.

07:32.512 --> 07:34.421
Miles?

07:36.015 --> 07:38.008
Are you joking?

07:39.394 --> 07:42.229
No, we're not. Let's go.

07:44.524 --> 07:48.569
Please stand ready.
I will operate your controls.

07:49.946 --> 07:54.075
Doctor, if you prefer to stay behind...

07:54.243 --> 07:55.986
No.

07:56.161 --> 07:58.652
No, if I'd be useful.
As long as you're going down,

07:58.831 --> 08:02.579
I might as well take a medical look
at whatever this is.

08:18.852 --> 08:21.936
Captain, the security guards.

08:22.981 --> 08:25.768
- Kirk here.
- Can you read me, Captain?

08:25.942 --> 08:28.813
Yes, Scotty. And I shouldn't be able
to this deep inside the planet.

08:28.987 --> 08:30.814
But perhaps that's been
arranged for us too.

08:30.989 --> 08:32.187
Is the security guard up there?

08:32.366 --> 08:35.532
They're fine, Captain.
They just didn't dematerialize.

08:35.702 --> 08:36.947
I don't like it, sir.

08:37.121 --> 08:41.118
No problem yet. Maintain alert.
Kirk out.

08:41.292 --> 08:42.952
Atmosphere report, Captain.

08:43.126 --> 08:47.789
A fraction richer in oxygen than
usual for us, but otherwise normal.

08:47.965 --> 08:51.132
This vault was constructed
about a half million years ago.

08:51.302 --> 08:53.710
About the same time the planet
surface was destroyed,

08:53.888 --> 08:57.471
- if our sensor readings are accurate.
- Composition of walls?

08:57.642 --> 09:00.180
They're an alloy or substance
completely unknown to me,

09:00.353 --> 09:04.102
much stronger and harder than
anything I've measured before.

09:04.482 --> 09:07.483
All readings are off the scale, Captain.

09:07.652 --> 09:10.903
The air seems fresh.
It must be re-circulated somehow.

09:11.406 --> 09:14.526
Is that for us?
Or does "it" need fresh air?

09:30.843 --> 09:32.503
Welcome.

09:33.930 --> 09:35.341
I am Sargon.

09:40.603 --> 09:43.973
Sargon, would it harm you if I...

09:44.149 --> 09:46.854
You may use your tricorder,
Mr. Spock.

09:47.027 --> 09:51.155
Your readings will show energy,
but no substance.

09:51.323 --> 09:55.652
Sealed in this receptacle
is the essence of my mind.

09:57.371 --> 10:00.491
Pure energy. Matter without form.

10:00.666 --> 10:02.326
Impossible.

10:02.501 --> 10:04.708
But you once had
a body of some type?

10:04.879 --> 10:07.168
A body much as yours, my children,

10:07.340 --> 10:10.045
although our minds
were infinitely greater.

10:10.218 --> 10:13.801
That's twice you've referred to us
as "my children."

10:13.972 --> 10:17.804
Because it is possible you are
our descendants, Captain Kirk.

10:17.976 --> 10:21.974
Six thousand centuries ago our
vessels were colonizing this galaxy

10:22.147 --> 10:26.726
just as your own starships have
now begun to explore that vastness.

10:26.902 --> 10:30.187
As you now leave your own seed
on distant planets,

10:30.364 --> 10:33.069
so we left our seed behind us.

10:33.242 --> 10:35.567
Perhaps your own legends
of an Adam and an Eve

10:35.744 --> 10:37.654
were two of our travellers.

10:38.414 --> 10:41.498
Our beliefs and our studies indicate

10:41.667 --> 10:45.535
that life on our planet Earth
evolved independently.

10:45.713 --> 10:50.007
That would tend, however, to explain
certain elements of Vulcan pre-history.

10:50.176 --> 10:52.169
In either case, I do not know.

10:52.345 --> 10:56.592
It was so long ago and the records of
our travels were lost in the cataclysm

10:56.766 --> 10:59.886
- which we loosened upon ourselves.
- A war?

11:00.061 --> 11:03.893
A struggle for such goals
and the unleashing of such power

11:04.066 --> 11:06.023
that you could not comprehend.

11:06.193 --> 11:10.273
Then perhaps your intelligence
wasn't so great, Sargon.

11:10.447 --> 11:14.575
We faced a similar crisis
in our earlier nuclear age.

11:14.743 --> 11:18.611
We found the wisdom
not to destroy ourselves.

11:18.789 --> 11:22.739
And we survived our primitive
nuclear era, my son.

11:22.919 --> 11:27.664
But there comes to all races,
an ultimate crisis

11:27.840 --> 11:29.632
which you have yet to face.

11:31.886 --> 11:33.297
I don't understand.

11:33.471 --> 11:37.469
One day our minds
became so powerful

11:37.642 --> 11:41.177
we dared think of ourselves as gods.

11:45.192 --> 11:49.521
You said you wanted our help.
What is it you wish?

11:59.123 --> 12:01.199
Just a moment, doctor.

12:05.671 --> 12:09.752
I am Sargon.

12:12.637 --> 12:14.677
Where's our Captain?

12:14.848 --> 12:16.840
Where's Jim Kirk?

12:17.017 --> 12:20.018
He is unharmed.

12:20.187 --> 12:26.640
I have taken his body to demonstrate.

12:27.486 --> 12:29.028
I won't go along with this!

12:30.823 --> 12:33.528
Back to where you were, Sargon,
or whatever you are.

12:33.701 --> 12:38.078
And if he refuses, doctor? What do
you propose to do with your phaser?

12:38.247 --> 12:39.741
That is still Jim's body.

12:55.307 --> 12:58.391
Lungs filling with air again...

13:00.187 --> 13:03.022
...to see again...

13:04.358 --> 13:08.403
...heart pumping, arteries

13:08.570 --> 13:11.062
surging with blood again.

13:11.365 --> 13:13.607
I can feel.

13:14.368 --> 13:17.737
After a half a million years...

13:19.498 --> 13:22.583
...to be again.

13:26.047 --> 13:30.626
Your Captain has
an excellent body, Dr. McCoy.

13:30.802 --> 13:33.340
I compliment you both

13:33.513 --> 13:37.297
on the condition in which
you maintained it.

13:39.227 --> 13:41.267
What are your plans for it?

13:41.438 --> 13:45.021
Can you exchange places again
when you wish?

13:45.192 --> 13:49.320
Have no fear.
Your Captain is quite unharmed.

13:49.488 --> 13:53.106
Although his mind generates
insufficient energy

13:53.284 --> 13:56.569
for him to speak from there as I do.

13:56.746 --> 14:00.031
- Doctor.
- Yes, I have the same readings.

14:00.208 --> 14:02.450
Are you aware of what's happening
to his body?

14:02.627 --> 14:05.082
Heart action doubled,
temperature 104 degrees.

14:05.255 --> 14:08.125
He'll die if you don't leave
his body soon.

14:08.299 --> 14:09.959
What is it you want of us?

14:12.429 --> 14:17.055
In the next room
there are other receptacles.

14:17.642 --> 14:21.475
The other two of us that survived.

14:21.813 --> 14:26.559
You, Dr. Ann Mulhall
and you Mr. Spock...

14:26.735 --> 14:30.484
...we require your bodies also.

14:30.656 --> 14:36.362
We must have Captain Kirk and you...

14:39.624 --> 14:42.791
...so that we may live again.

14:56.892 --> 15:01.601
Even for us, a half million years
is almost too long to wait.

15:02.147 --> 15:06.608
Two others still survive, Henoch...

15:09.488 --> 15:11.730
...and Thalassa.

15:13.993 --> 15:16.947
Thalassa, my Thalassa...

15:17.121 --> 15:20.371
...I am pleased you survived.

15:23.711 --> 15:28.124
Forgive me. It has been so very long.

15:28.299 --> 15:31.217
When the struggle came
which devastated your planet...

15:31.386 --> 15:34.055
Only the best minds
were chosen to survive.

15:34.556 --> 15:37.723
Thalassa, my wife,
as you may have guessed.

15:37.893 --> 15:40.645
Henoch, from the other side.

15:40.813 --> 15:44.976
Realizing our mistake,
we attempted to perpetuate both sides.

15:45.150 --> 15:47.309
We built this chamber here

15:47.528 --> 15:51.608
in order to preserve our essence
in this fashion.

15:51.782 --> 15:53.656
Fascinating.

15:54.076 --> 15:59.617
We knew the seed that we had planted
on other planets would take root,

15:59.791 --> 16:02.957
that one day you would build vessels
as we did.

16:03.127 --> 16:04.670
And one day you would come here.

16:05.213 --> 16:08.629
These others, they were stored
differently than you.

16:08.925 --> 16:11.962
But it was your task to remain
in the receptacle out there...

16:12.137 --> 16:16.051
And search the heavens
with my mind, probing,

16:16.266 --> 16:21.509
waiting, probing. And then one day
my mind touched your vessel...

16:22.022 --> 16:23.564
...and brought you here.

16:23.732 --> 16:25.939
So you could steal
our bodies from us?

16:26.360 --> 16:32.149
To steal? To take them from you?
No, my children, you misunderstand.

16:33.451 --> 16:37.614
We mean only that you should lend us
your bodies for a short time.

16:37.789 --> 16:40.955
And destroy them. Just as
you're burning that one up now.

16:41.334 --> 16:46.376
Heart beat 262, Spock, the entire
metabolic rate correspondingly high.

16:47.048 --> 16:50.963
I will return your Captain to you
before the body limit has been reached.

16:51.136 --> 16:54.054
Our bodies, Sargon.
For what purpose?

16:55.057 --> 16:56.634
To build...

16:59.228 --> 17:01.933
To build humanoid robots.

17:02.106 --> 17:04.679
We must borrow your
bodies long enough

17:04.858 --> 17:06.816
to have the use
of your hands, your fingers.

17:06.986 --> 17:09.940
Then you intend to
construct mechanical bodies,

17:10.114 --> 17:14.491
move your minds into them,
and then return our bodies to us.

17:14.660 --> 17:19.156
We have engineers, technicians. Why
can't they build your robots for you?

17:19.999 --> 17:21.957
No, our methods...

17:22.127 --> 17:26.670
...our skills are far beyond
your abilities.

17:29.634 --> 17:30.832
It is time.

17:52.992 --> 17:54.819
Is it you, Jim?

17:59.457 --> 18:02.375
Good. His metabolic rate
is back to normal.

18:03.461 --> 18:06.830
Captain, do you know what happened?

18:07.007 --> 18:09.046
- Do you remember any part of it?
- Yes.

18:09.217 --> 18:15.754
Sargon borrowed my body.
I was floating in time and space.

18:16.433 --> 18:19.719
He doesn't appear to be harmed
physically anyway.

18:19.895 --> 18:23.229
Spock, I remember!

18:24.316 --> 18:29.559
When Sargon and I exchanged,
as we passed each other...

18:30.198 --> 18:33.068
...for an instant we were one.

18:34.243 --> 18:38.573
I know him now.
I know what he is, and what he wants.

18:38.748 --> 18:41.418
And I don't fear him.

18:41.584 --> 18:43.910
That's the most ridiculous statement
I've ever heard.

18:44.087 --> 18:47.254
An alien practically hijacks your body
and then corks you into a bottle...

18:47.424 --> 18:49.630
I'm afraid I must agree
with Dr. McCoy.

18:49.801 --> 18:53.005
You could be suffering from
a form of false euphoria.

18:57.101 --> 19:00.470
- Sargon.
- I understand, my son.

19:00.646 --> 19:05.189
Go to your vessel. All who
are involved must agree to this.

19:05.359 --> 19:08.775
After all these centuries,
we can wait a few more hours.

19:08.946 --> 19:11.069
And what if we should
decide against you?

19:11.282 --> 19:13.690
Then you may go as free
as you came.

19:13.868 --> 19:15.742
You're going to what?

19:17.372 --> 19:19.827
- Are they all right in the head, doctor?
- No comment.

19:19.999 --> 19:22.621
A simple transference,
their minds and ours.

19:22.794 --> 19:24.288
Quite simple. Happens every day.

19:24.462 --> 19:26.372
Scotty, I need your approval too,

19:26.548 --> 19:29.300
since you'll be working with them,
furnishing them with all they need

19:29.468 --> 19:30.843
to make the android robots.

19:31.011 --> 19:33.846
You won't be working with them
you'll be working with us, our bodies.

19:34.014 --> 19:37.632
- They'll be inside us and we'll be...
- It all seems rather indecent to me.

19:37.810 --> 19:42.271
I'm not so certain of that, doctor.
It is scientifically fascinating.

19:43.232 --> 19:47.100
Once inside their
mechanical bodies, Engineer...

19:47.278 --> 19:50.647
...they can leave this planet,
travel back with us.

19:50.823 --> 19:53.908
With their knowledge, mankind
could leap ahead 10,000 years.

19:54.077 --> 19:55.820
Bones, they'll show us
medical advances,

19:55.995 --> 19:57.655
miracles you never dreamed possible.

19:57.831 --> 20:00.748
Scotty, engineering advances,
vessels this size,

20:00.917 --> 20:04.666
with engines the size of walnuts.

20:04.838 --> 20:08.172
- You're joking.
- No, he's not.

20:08.342 --> 20:10.465
They're giants and we're insects
beside them.

20:10.636 --> 20:13.174
They could destroy us
without meaning to.

20:13.347 --> 20:16.134
And all he wants is
the body of our Captain

20:16.308 --> 20:18.680
and our second in command too.

20:19.436 --> 20:20.682
Coincidence?

20:20.855 --> 20:23.690
They selected us
as the most compatible bodies.

20:25.276 --> 20:27.067
What's your attitude on that, doctor?

20:29.238 --> 20:32.608
Well, if we all agree...

20:33.701 --> 20:36.952
...l'm willing to host Thalassa's mind.

20:38.957 --> 20:40.866
I'm a scientist.

20:41.042 --> 20:44.542
The opportunity is
an extraordinary one...

20:44.713 --> 20:47.548
...for experimentation, observation.

20:48.133 --> 20:51.633
A starship engine
the size of a walnut?

20:51.804 --> 20:53.713
That's impossible.

20:54.056 --> 20:59.347
But, I don't suppose there'd be any
harm in looking over diagrams on it.

21:01.564 --> 21:05.478
Bones, you could stop all this
by saying no.

21:07.320 --> 21:09.063
That's why I called you all
here together.

21:12.200 --> 21:16.529
We'll all be deeply involved.
It must be unanimous.

21:16.705 --> 21:20.370
Then I'll still want one question
answered to my satisfaction.

21:21.084 --> 21:22.792
Why?

21:22.961 --> 21:25.250
Not a list of possible miracles.

21:25.422 --> 21:31.046
But a simple basic understandable
"why" that overrides all danger.

21:31.470 --> 21:35.598
Let's not kid ourselves that
there is no potential danger in this.

21:38.602 --> 21:42.185
They used to say, if man could fly,
he'd have wings.

21:42.356 --> 21:45.690
But he did fly,
he discovered he had to.

21:47.362 --> 21:51.940
Do you wish that the first Apollo
Mission hadn't reached the moon,

21:52.242 --> 21:55.942
or that we hadn't gone on to Mars
and then to the nearest star?

21:56.121 --> 21:59.704
That's like saying you wish that
you still operated with scalpels,

21:59.875 --> 22:02.163
and sewed your patients up
with catgut,

22:02.335 --> 22:06.499
like your great-great-great-
great-grandfather used to.

22:09.301 --> 22:13.050
I'm in command. I could order this.

22:13.639 --> 22:15.632
But I'm not...

22:18.102 --> 22:22.848
...because Dr. McCoy is right...

22:23.691 --> 22:28.021
...in pointing out the enormous
danger potential...

22:28.196 --> 22:31.482
...in any contact with life
and intelligence,

22:31.658 --> 22:33.864
as fantastically advanced as this.

22:34.035 --> 22:36.906
But I must point out
that the possibilities

22:37.080 --> 22:42.751
the potential for knowledge
and advancement is equally great.

22:46.632 --> 22:48.423
Risk.

22:48.592 --> 22:51.344
Risk is our business.

22:52.179 --> 22:55.097
That's what this starship is all about.

22:55.266 --> 22:58.136
That's why we're aboard her.

23:04.942 --> 23:07.647
You may dissent without prejudice.

23:10.782 --> 23:14.032
Do I hear a negative vote?

23:25.839 --> 23:27.749
Engineer...

23:28.550 --> 23:31.884
...stand by to beam aboard
three receptacles.

23:32.805 --> 23:35.261
The extreme power of the alien mind

23:35.433 --> 23:37.675
will drive the heart action
dangerously high

23:37.852 --> 23:41.470
and the body functions will race
many times their normal metabolism.

23:41.647 --> 23:44.435
So we're going to have to monitor
this very carefully.

23:44.609 --> 23:46.317
Yes, sir.

23:46.903 --> 23:49.061
Well, I guess we're about as ready
as we'll ever be.

23:49.239 --> 23:51.944
- Jim.
- Ready, Sargon.

24:26.611 --> 24:30.775
The transference is complete.

24:37.873 --> 24:41.040
Metabolic rate is doubled
and rising, doctor.

24:44.713 --> 24:46.540
Hello.

24:49.260 --> 24:51.798
You are a lovely female.

24:51.971 --> 24:56.016
A pleasant sight to wake up to
after half a million years.

24:56.183 --> 24:59.185
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

25:11.449 --> 25:14.783
I'd forgotten what it felt like...

25:17.539 --> 25:20.113
...even to breathe again.

25:29.677 --> 25:31.337
Sargon?

25:41.189 --> 25:43.016
Here.

25:43.858 --> 25:45.650
In this body.

26:08.259 --> 26:12.091
I am not displeased, my husband.

26:12.263 --> 26:16.890
Your body is not unlike that
which was your own.

26:17.769 --> 26:23.724
And I too, am pleased, beloved.

26:27.570 --> 26:29.480
After so long...

26:31.116 --> 26:33.572
...so very long.

26:37.664 --> 26:39.289
Yes.

26:51.762 --> 26:53.672
This is an excellent body, doctor.

26:53.848 --> 26:57.134
I seemed to have received
the best of the three.

26:57.310 --> 27:01.224
Strength, hearing, eyesight,
all far above your human norms.

27:01.397 --> 27:04.019
I'm surprised the Vulcans
never conquered your race.

27:04.192 --> 27:06.600
Vulcans worship
peace above all, Henoch.

27:06.778 --> 27:09.779
Yes, of course. Just as we do, doctor.

27:09.948 --> 27:11.442
Nurse.

27:16.538 --> 27:17.949
Doctor.

27:22.962 --> 27:24.835
Henoch, you'd better
get back to bed too.

27:25.005 --> 27:26.204
It will be unnecessary, doctor.

27:26.382 --> 27:29.881
This Vulcan body is accustomed
to the higher metabolism.

27:31.053 --> 27:34.921
Sargon, it won't work. You've got to
get out before you kill them.

27:35.475 --> 27:37.717
We will vacate at once

27:37.894 --> 27:41.310
until you can administer a metabolic
reduction injection.

27:42.065 --> 27:45.149
- A what?
- I'll prepare the formula, Sargon.

27:45.443 --> 27:48.314
Henoch, your condition?

27:48.780 --> 27:51.152
I can continue in this body
for several hours.

27:51.700 --> 27:53.527
Fortunate.

27:54.077 --> 27:58.455
We will vacate at once.

28:13.181 --> 28:15.090
This woman will assist me.

28:15.850 --> 28:19.100
You will take me
to your pharmacology laboratory.

28:23.525 --> 28:26.098
Bones, what...

28:26.278 --> 28:29.943
It was close, Jim.
You both barely got back alive.

28:30.115 --> 28:32.523
Unless the formula works,
we can't risk it again.

28:35.329 --> 28:38.912
Now, this formula will reduce
the heart action

28:39.083 --> 28:40.992
and the bodily functions to normal.

28:41.627 --> 28:43.501
While the bodies are occupied,

28:43.671 --> 28:47.538
you will administer one injection
of 10 cc's each hour.

28:47.717 --> 28:48.879
I understand.

28:49.051 --> 28:52.717
This hypo you will code mark
for Thalassa.

28:54.432 --> 28:59.474
And this one,
you will code mark for me.

28:59.646 --> 29:01.603
Yes, sir.

29:01.773 --> 29:06.898
This one, you will administer
to Captain Kirk...

29:07.070 --> 29:09.277
...while Sargon is in his body.

29:12.117 --> 29:14.608
This hypo does not contain
the same formula.

29:14.912 --> 29:16.454
No, that's correct.

29:16.622 --> 29:20.406
But since I will arrange for you
to administer each of the injections,

29:20.584 --> 29:22.411
no one else will notice.

29:22.586 --> 29:25.540
But without the same formula,
Captain Kirk will die.

29:33.348 --> 29:34.925
What were you saying?

29:38.311 --> 29:42.724
I was... I wanted to say something.
I've forgotten what it was.

29:43.775 --> 29:47.773
You were about to say that you
watched me prepare the formula

29:47.946 --> 29:49.773
and fill each of the hypos.

29:49.948 --> 29:52.522
Yes, that was it.

29:53.202 --> 29:58.362
I will inform Dr. McCoy that each
is properly filled for each patient.

29:58.749 --> 30:00.078
Very good.

30:00.292 --> 30:03.958
You see, Sargon would not permit me
to keep this body.

30:04.171 --> 30:07.505
It is therefore necessary for you
to kill your Captain

30:07.675 --> 30:09.549
so that Sargon will die with him.

30:18.895 --> 30:22.940
Enterprise Medical Log.
Stardate 4769.1.

30:23.108 --> 30:26.394
Three alien minds now inhabit
the bodies of Captain Kirk,

30:26.653 --> 30:30.402
Science Officer Spock,
and Dr. Ann Mulhall.

30:30.574 --> 30:34.868
As planned, the construction
of android robots is underway.

30:35.371 --> 30:40.662
All is proceeding as expected
and as promised.

30:41.293 --> 30:43.619
I can find no reason for concern...

30:44.338 --> 30:47.707
...but yet, I am filled with foreboding.

30:59.563 --> 31:03.014
Sargon, I remember a day long ago.

31:03.525 --> 31:05.850
We sat beside a silver lake.

31:06.028 --> 31:09.313
The air was scented
with the flowers of our planet.

31:09.948 --> 31:11.146
I remember.

31:12.868 --> 31:16.533
You held my hand like this.

31:23.045 --> 31:25.667
I think it best not to remember so well.

31:25.840 --> 31:29.043
In two days you'll have hands
of your own again, Thalassa.

31:29.218 --> 31:32.919
Mechanically efficient
and quite human looking.

31:33.098 --> 31:38.056
Android, robot hands, of course.
Hands without feeling.

31:38.687 --> 31:41.356
Enjoy the taste of life while you can.

31:41.523 --> 31:45.307
Our minds will have survived.
And as androids...

31:46.361 --> 31:49.066
...we can move among
the people who do live...

31:49.615 --> 31:55.155
...teaching them, helping them
not to make the errors we did.

31:59.542 --> 32:02.911
- What is it, Sargon?
- Nothing.

32:03.087 --> 32:06.871
Our next injection will renovate me.
Do not be concerned.

32:23.025 --> 32:26.310
Nurse, how are the last metabolical
readings on our patients?

32:26.487 --> 32:30.947
You'll find them excellent, doctor.
Well within normal.

32:33.869 --> 32:36.491
Is something wrong, Miss Chapel?

32:37.498 --> 32:39.206
Yes...

32:39.750 --> 32:42.586
...I had something to say.

32:43.212 --> 32:47.162
- I can't seem to remember.
- Regarding our patients?

32:49.052 --> 32:52.385
Yes. That must be it.

32:53.473 --> 32:57.257
I am so pleased
the way they are responding, doctor.

32:57.435 --> 33:00.353
The formula is working perfectly.

33:00.689 --> 33:02.267
You look tired, Miss Chapel.

33:02.441 --> 33:06.273
Perhaps you'd care for me to
administer the last few injections.

33:06.445 --> 33:09.648
Tired? Not at all, doctor.

33:09.823 --> 33:12.030
Thank you for asking.

33:30.678 --> 33:32.671
Thank you.

33:32.847 --> 33:35.683
Have you prepared
the megaton hydra coils

33:35.851 --> 33:38.009
for the drawings Sargon supplied?

33:38.186 --> 33:40.974
For all the good it will do you.

33:41.356 --> 33:43.682
It's a fancy name...

33:43.859 --> 33:47.939
...but how will something that looks like
a drop of jelly make this thing work?

33:48.113 --> 33:50.439
You'll need micro-gears
and some form of pulley

33:50.616 --> 33:52.110
that does what a muscle does.

33:52.284 --> 33:54.242
That would be highly inefficient.

33:54.412 --> 33:57.745
I tell you, lady. This thing won't work.

33:58.374 --> 34:01.909
It will have twice the strength
and agility of your body, Engineer,

34:02.086 --> 34:04.043
and will last a thousand years.

34:04.213 --> 34:09.172
That is, assuming you'll stop wasting
your time and allow us to complete it.

34:15.934 --> 34:18.888
A thousand-year prison, Thalassa.

34:19.396 --> 34:21.969
When it wears out,
we'll build another one,

34:22.149 --> 34:25.399
and we'll lock ourselves into it
for another thousand years,

34:25.569 --> 34:28.855
and then another and another.

34:29.239 --> 34:33.402
Sargon has closed his mind
to a better way...

34:33.744 --> 34:35.203
...with these bodies.

34:38.458 --> 34:40.949
They're not ours, Henoch.

34:44.255 --> 34:48.833
When you awoke
in this body, Thalassa...

34:49.010 --> 34:52.011
...you said how good it was
to breathe again...

34:52.889 --> 34:57.635
...to have eyes
and to see again, to feel...

34:58.395 --> 35:03.141
...to live and feel again, Thalassa.

35:04.735 --> 35:08.982
Just think, how much we can do
for mankind.

35:10.241 --> 35:16.030
Are these bodies too much to ask for
in return? Would you prefer this?

35:17.498 --> 35:19.123
No.

35:19.751 --> 35:21.909
I'm beginning to hate it.

35:30.262 --> 35:31.970
Sickbay.

35:32.139 --> 35:34.345
Sickbay. McCoy.

35:34.516 --> 35:36.307
Sargon here, McCoy. I'm in your...

35:37.895 --> 35:43.565
- Deck 6 briefing room.
- You sound terrible. Wait there for me.

35:47.696 --> 35:49.488
Sargon, what is it?

35:49.657 --> 35:53.240
Nothing of importance.
Fatigue perhaps.

35:54.453 --> 35:56.078
Henoch's formula.

35:56.247 --> 35:59.616
Yes, I wanted to be certain
there was no error.

35:59.792 --> 36:03.458
The formula is correct.

36:04.714 --> 36:06.837
Don't be concerned.

36:09.845 --> 36:12.336
It is an excellent body.

36:13.682 --> 36:17.846
There you see, I feel better already.

36:20.022 --> 36:24.351
In time our host body will become
accustomed to us, husband.

36:24.526 --> 36:27.231
Injections will no longer be necessary.

36:27.488 --> 36:32.067
That will take months, perhaps years.
We haven't that choice, Thalassa.

36:32.994 --> 36:34.785
Husband...

36:35.371 --> 36:37.862
...feel the touch of my hand, husband.

36:38.207 --> 36:39.999
No, beloved.

36:41.711 --> 36:44.167
- If we torment ourselves...
- Beloved.

36:45.048 --> 36:47.088
What will that word mean
to a machine?

36:47.259 --> 36:50.841
Our thoughts will intertwine.

36:51.012 --> 36:53.219
Will they, husband?

36:54.474 --> 36:57.310
Will they intertwine like this?

36:58.228 --> 37:02.440
Can two minds press close like this?

37:03.192 --> 37:06.561
Can robot lips do this?

37:19.334 --> 37:22.501
Sargon, what is it?

37:29.052 --> 37:30.961
Hypo.

37:35.100 --> 37:36.559
Doctor, help him.

37:44.485 --> 37:46.276
He's dead.

37:57.957 --> 38:01.907
Medical Log. Stardate 4770.3.

38:02.087 --> 38:04.708
Do I list one death or two?

38:04.881 --> 38:06.162
When Kirk's body died,

38:06.341 --> 38:10.671
Sargon was too far distant
from his receptacle to transfer back.

38:10.846 --> 38:14.844
Sargon is dead.
But is Captain Kirk dead?

38:15.267 --> 38:18.553
His body is, but his consciousness
is still in the receptacle,

38:18.729 --> 38:21.137
into which it was transferred earlier.

38:32.326 --> 38:35.363
All his vital organs
are now working, doctor.

38:35.538 --> 38:38.623
Yes, we can keep them going
for a few weeks or a month,

38:38.792 --> 38:40.334
for all the good it'll do.

38:44.089 --> 38:47.090
Why pretend to work
on that thing, Henoch?

38:47.259 --> 38:49.832
You know you never intended
to leave Spock's body.

38:50.429 --> 38:53.134
This is your new home, Thalassa.

38:53.640 --> 38:58.349
Once occupied, I'll add female features
and some texturing.

38:58.687 --> 39:02.685
You, no doubt, want the mechanism
to at least appear to be a woman.

39:14.871 --> 39:18.038
- It is ready, Thalassa.
- No!

39:19.000 --> 39:22.250
You have no excuse
to keep the real body any longer.

39:22.420 --> 39:25.421
Sargon would have required that you
enter the mechanism immediately.

39:25.799 --> 39:28.255
I cannot live in that thing.

39:38.896 --> 39:40.556
Doctor?

39:41.399 --> 39:43.190
Yes?

39:47.196 --> 39:50.530
Would you like to save
your Captain Kirk?

39:51.909 --> 39:54.745
But you said that was impossible.

40:02.212 --> 40:06.957
We have many powers
Sargon did not permit us to use.

40:07.134 --> 40:09.173
He thought them too tempting to us.

40:09.344 --> 40:13.389
This body pleases me.
I intend to keep it.

40:13.599 --> 40:15.473
I see.

40:17.603 --> 40:21.138
And Henoch intends to keep
Spock's body, of course.

40:21.315 --> 40:23.604
Henoch's plans are his own affair.

40:23.776 --> 40:28.023
I wish only to exist in peace...

40:28.197 --> 40:29.740
...as a living woman.

40:29.907 --> 40:34.866
- If you're asking my approval...
- I require only your silence.

40:35.288 --> 40:40.531
Only you and I will know that Dr.
Mulhall has not returned to her body.

40:40.710 --> 40:43.415
Isn't that worth your Captain's life?

40:47.301 --> 40:49.127
Doctor...

40:50.512 --> 40:52.885
...we can take what we wish.

40:55.100 --> 40:59.644
Neither you, this ship, nor all your
worlds have the power to stop us.

40:59.814 --> 41:02.221
Neither Jim nor I can trade a body
we don't own.

41:02.400 --> 41:06.267
- It belongs to a young woman.
- Who you hardly know.

41:06.738 --> 41:08.944
Almost a stranger to you.

41:09.115 --> 41:13.492
I will not peddle flesh. I'm a physician.

41:14.662 --> 41:18.957
A physician?
In contrast to what we are...

41:19.125 --> 41:21.035
...you are a prancing...

41:21.962 --> 41:24.251
...savage medicine man.

41:24.506 --> 41:28.836
You dare defy one you should be
on your knees worshiping?

41:29.887 --> 41:33.172
I could destroy you
with a single thought.

41:44.652 --> 41:46.111
Stop!

41:55.705 --> 41:57.828
Sargon was right.

41:58.500 --> 42:01.417
Temptations within a living body
are too great.

42:02.212 --> 42:03.243
Forgive me.

42:03.755 --> 42:06.460
I am pleased, my beloved.

42:06.633 --> 42:09.718
It is good you have found
the truth yourself.

42:10.054 --> 42:12.379
Sargon.

42:14.308 --> 42:16.301
Where are you?

42:16.811 --> 42:19.099
I thought you destroyed by Henoch.

42:19.272 --> 42:23.601
I have power even Henoch
does not suspect, beloved.

42:28.406 --> 42:33.317
Yes, I see. I understand.

42:36.373 --> 42:41.960
Just as we would have placed
our consciousness within robots...

42:42.588 --> 42:46.420
...Sargon has placed his
into your vessel.

42:48.093 --> 42:49.588
Doctor.

42:49.762 --> 42:51.754
Doctor, leave us.

42:52.473 --> 42:55.676
Sargon has a plan.
We have much work to do.

43:20.460 --> 43:22.749
This is the Sickbay. Get me...

43:25.466 --> 43:28.217
Nurse Chapel, what in the devil...

43:42.692 --> 43:46.820
Jim, are you all right?

43:46.988 --> 43:49.906
Yes, I'm fine, Bones.

43:55.580 --> 44:00.326
- Thalassa?
- She is now with Sargon, doctor.

44:00.502 --> 44:04.286
I'm Ann Mulhall, back in my own body.

44:17.019 --> 44:21.349
Jim, the receptacles. Spock's
consciousness was in one of them.

44:21.524 --> 44:25.273
- It was necessary.
- What are you talking about?

44:25.445 --> 44:28.529
There is no Spock
to return to his body.

44:28.698 --> 44:32.281
You've killed a loyal officer.
Your best friend!

44:32.452 --> 44:35.987
Bones, prepare a hypo. The fastest,
deadliest poison to Vulcans.

44:36.164 --> 44:38.702
Spock's consciousness is gone.

44:39.751 --> 44:42.289
We must kill his body...

44:42.463 --> 44:43.957
...the thing in it.

44:58.062 --> 45:00.304
Must I make an example
of you too, Helm?

45:02.817 --> 45:04.193
Pain, Captain.

45:07.238 --> 45:08.697
And you, my dear...

45:14.121 --> 45:16.030
Fortunately, doctor,

45:16.206 --> 45:21.746
I know every thought of every
mind around me. See?

45:22.421 --> 45:23.880
Take the hypo from him.

45:28.928 --> 45:31.300
And inject him with it.

45:44.652 --> 45:46.028
You fools!

45:46.196 --> 45:50.146
I'll simply transfer to another place,

45:50.325 --> 45:52.116
another body.

45:55.205 --> 45:57.162
Sargon.

45:57.875 --> 46:01.493
No, Sargon, please, let me...

46:02.296 --> 46:05.463
...let me transfer...

46:19.314 --> 46:21.140
Spock.

46:24.611 --> 46:26.817
My friend, Spock.

46:28.156 --> 46:31.074
If there'd only been another way.

46:31.952 --> 46:36.863
I could not allow your sacrifice
of one so close to you.

46:51.305 --> 46:53.013
You're alive.

46:53.182 --> 46:55.673
There was enough poison in that hypo
to kill 10 Vulcans.

46:55.852 --> 46:59.351
No, doctor. I allowed you
to believe that to be true

46:59.522 --> 47:02.891
so that Henoch would read your
thoughts and believe it also.

47:03.151 --> 47:04.266
Sargon.

47:04.611 --> 47:08.443
It seems, doctor, the injection was only
enough to cause unconsciousness.

47:08.615 --> 47:11.402
But Henoch believed
and fled the body.

47:11.576 --> 47:13.035
He is destroyed.

47:13.203 --> 47:17.201
But your vessel was destroyed too.
Where was your consciousness kept?

47:17.374 --> 47:20.874
The place Henoch
would least suspect, Captain.

47:23.798 --> 47:27.001
That is why I was summoned
into the Sickbay, doctor.

47:27.176 --> 47:30.510
Mr. Spock's consciousness
was placed in me.

47:30.680 --> 47:32.756
We shared consciousness together.

47:32.932 --> 47:35.221
We now know we cannot
permit ourselves

47:35.393 --> 47:38.062
to exist in your world, my children.

47:38.229 --> 47:42.891
Thalassa and I must now also depart
into oblivion.

47:43.401 --> 47:46.521
Is there any way we can
help you, Sargon?

47:46.696 --> 47:48.072
Yes, my son.

47:48.240 --> 47:52.154
You can allow Thalassa and me
to share your bodies again.

47:52.327 --> 47:55.328
A last moment together.

48:20.190 --> 48:24.022
Oblivion together
does not frighten me, beloved.

48:27.906 --> 48:30.444
Promise we will be together.

48:31.159 --> 48:34.114
I promise, beloved.

48:34.288 --> 48:36.280
Together forever.

48:37.374 --> 48:40.790
Forever, beloved...

48:41.504 --> 48:43.627
...forever.

49:02.442 --> 49:04.684
Well, I'm sure...

49:04.861 --> 49:08.906
...that Sargon appreciated your
cooperation, Dr. Mulhall.

49:09.074 --> 49:13.570
Yes, I was happy to cooperate,
Captain.

49:16.915 --> 49:19.122
It was beautiful.
