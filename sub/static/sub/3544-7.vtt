00:02.160 --> 00:03.880
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:04.040 --> 00:05.485
- I'm Elena.
- I'm Stefan.

00:05.680 --> 00:08.365
<i>Love brought me to Mystic Falls,
love drove me away.</i>

00:08.560 --> 00:10.881
- I love you, Damon.
- Silas.

00:11.080 --> 00:12.127
Hello, my shadow self.

00:13.840 --> 00:14.887
Bonnie's dead, Elena.

00:15.080 --> 00:16.525
I can't believe she's gone.

00:16.720 --> 00:18.802
<i>We'll do anything
to protect people we love.</i>

00:19.000 --> 00:21.241
Katherine,
he needs your blood to cure himself.

00:21.440 --> 00:22.487
No.

00:24.240 --> 00:27.562
Silas, you said now that you're a witch
again, you'd bring Bonnie back...

00:27.760 --> 00:29.250
- ...from the Other Side.
- I did.

00:29.440 --> 00:31.920
She's the freaky carbon copy
of my true love Amara.

00:32.119 --> 00:33.565
I have to be cured.

00:33.840 --> 00:35.080
Amara's been cured.

00:35.280 --> 00:38.602
The fate of the Other Side
rests on a living, breathing human being...

00:38.800 --> 00:40.370
that we now need to protect.

00:43.200 --> 00:44.964
<i>You ever been in love?</i>

00:45.840 --> 00:47.968
Love? Hello, you two.

00:49.040 --> 00:51.008
Yeah, we're together. Heh. In love.

00:51.200 --> 00:54.010
Aw. That's so adorable.

00:54.240 --> 00:57.369
I love love, l do.

00:57.560 --> 00:58.800
Yeah.

00:59.040 --> 01:00.804
I got a soul mate too.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.765
That love-at-first-sight,
wanna live forever...

01:04.000 --> 01:05.809
love is eternal kind of love.

01:06.160 --> 01:08.891
Amara. That's her name.

01:09.080 --> 01:11.651
See, when I first met Amara,
I was with another woman...

01:11.880 --> 01:15.327
so I kind of cheated on her.
Which, to be honest with you...

01:15.520 --> 01:18.126
it really wouldn't have been
that big of a deal...

01:18.320 --> 01:22.120
except it turned out that the
other woman was a raging lunatic.

01:22.480 --> 01:25.290
So when she found out
that I cheated on her...

01:25.520 --> 01:28.330
she freaked out
and turned Amara into stone.

01:28.560 --> 01:31.962
Like, literally, Medusa-style.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.606
Dude, are you, like, okay?

01:36.120 --> 01:37.929
What do you mean?
You think I'm crazy?

01:38.120 --> 01:40.691
Why?
All I've wanted for the last 2000 years...

01:40.880 --> 01:44.362
is to be reunited with the love of my life.
How is that crazy?

01:44.920 --> 01:47.048
Maybe the "turned her to stone" part.

01:47.240 --> 01:49.163
Or the 2000 years part.

01:49.360 --> 01:54.161
No, guys, we were both immortal
and now we're not. Hello?

01:56.280 --> 01:58.169
The point is, I finally had the chance...

01:58.360 --> 02:00.681
to hold Amara in my arms,
and what does she do?

02:00.880 --> 02:04.327
She jams a chunk of glass
into my carotid artery. Look.

02:04.560 --> 02:07.723
- Look.
- No, thanks. No.

02:08.199 --> 02:11.090
Listen, you two, here's my advice.
Live it up.

02:11.280 --> 02:13.521
You know, enjoy this love while it lasts.

02:13.720 --> 02:16.166
Because let me tell you something,
a couple days ago...

02:16.400 --> 02:19.006
I was psychic, I was immortal,
I was in love.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.766
Now my neck hurts,
my soul is crushed...

02:21.960 --> 02:24.406
I'm sitting at a bus stop
in fricking Delaware.

02:24.640 --> 02:25.687
You're in Philly.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.245
I'm in Philly?

02:29.080 --> 02:31.287
God, that's even worse.

02:32.920 --> 02:35.082
- What's going on, babe?
- I don't know.

02:35.640 --> 02:39.247
Hey, talk to me.
Oh, my God. What's happening?

02:40.720 --> 02:44.964
- What are you doing to him?
- I think I'm liquefying his internal organs.

02:45.160 --> 02:47.322
Did I fail to mention that I'm a witch?

02:47.560 --> 02:51.007
- Please, stop!
- No. I'm pissed off at the world...

02:51.200 --> 02:55.000
and I'm taking it out
on your so-called lover.

02:55.200 --> 02:56.531
Please.

02:56.720 --> 02:58.529
I'm thinking you might be my next victim.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.730
Oh, my God.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.284
Look at that.

03:05.480 --> 03:08.563
Unbelievable. Love is so damn fickle.

03:08.760 --> 03:11.923
Incredible. Up you go, buddy.
Come on up.

03:12.120 --> 03:15.090
Come on up, come on up.
Up you go. That's good.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.248
Buses, however...

03:22.440 --> 03:24.442
tried and true.

03:41.520 --> 03:43.124
<i>Hello, my shadow self.</i>

03:45.960 --> 03:47.166
Silas.

03:49.800 --> 03:50.847
<i>STOP-</i>

03:57.000 --> 03:58.411
Stefan.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.201
Morning.

04:03.480 --> 04:04.527
I made coffee.

04:05.160 --> 04:06.207
How did you sleep?

04:06.400 --> 04:07.686
Ah, pfft.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.405
Not great. Heh.

04:09.640 --> 04:11.961
First night back in your own bed.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.242
Not as comfy as Tessa's couch?

04:14.480 --> 04:17.723
If we're gonna talk about Tessa,
I think I need that caffeine.

04:21.440 --> 04:25.525
So, uh, what's with the wake-up call?

04:26.200 --> 04:27.361
I miss you.

04:28.800 --> 04:34.170
I feel like when you lost your memories,
I lost a friend.

04:35.400 --> 04:39.610
And I was thinking, instead of describing
how much we meant to each other...

04:39.840 --> 04:41.842
maybe we can just start fresh.

04:44.640 --> 04:46.927
Hi. I'm Elena.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.721
I was driving to Portland.

04:50.920 --> 04:52.570
What?

04:53.080 --> 04:56.323
The night I took Silas to the quarry.

04:57.600 --> 05:01.491
I said goodbye to Lexi
and then I decided to keep driving west.

05:01.680 --> 05:04.047
Wait. Hang on. How do you remember that?

05:04.960 --> 05:07.361
Because my memories are back.

05:08.360 --> 05:12.604
Really? Are you serious? How?

05:12.960 --> 05:14.928
Tessa came here last night...

05:15.160 --> 05:18.130
and she undid whatever spell
fried my brain...

05:19.560 --> 05:22.450
and it's all back.
I can remember everything.

05:24.080 --> 05:25.844
Stefan, this is great.

05:27.400 --> 05:28.765
Mm.

05:29.280 --> 05:31.203
Oh, this is amazing.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.209
<i>DAMON'.
October, 1852.</i>

05:33.480 --> 05:38.361
You broke my nose trying to teach me
how to throw a right hook.

05:38.600 --> 05:41.080
- But not on purpose, just to be clear.
- Heh.

05:41.280 --> 05:44.329
How much did you pay for that
hunk of junk motorcycle you ride?

05:44.520 --> 05:48.002
That's a trick question.
You bought me that motorcycle.

05:48.240 --> 05:50.846
Although,
I'm guessing it was pretty expensive.

05:51.040 --> 05:53.771
Tessa just gave back your memories?
No strings attached?

05:53.960 --> 05:58.329
Well, it wasn't exactly a gift.
It was a lot to take in all at once.

05:58.520 --> 06:02.411
Everything from blowing out the candles
on my first birthday cake...

06:03.480 --> 06:05.403
to drowning in a safe.

06:08.640 --> 06:09.846
Stefan?

06:10.720 --> 06:11.846
Whoa.

06:12.200 --> 06:13.611
Easy there, buddy.

06:18.320 --> 06:22.006
Stefan, where did you go?

06:23.400 --> 06:24.447
Ah. Heh.

06:24.640 --> 06:28.008
All that and I still can't remember
my own strength.

06:33.640 --> 06:36.166
- What was that noise?
- Uh, well, that is...

06:36.360 --> 06:39.125
- We have a situation.
- Of the doppelganger variety.

06:39.320 --> 06:41.322
- Yeah.
- Katherine?

06:41.520 --> 06:43.648
No. Nope. Not Katherine.

06:45.120 --> 06:46.485
I don't know!

06:49.200 --> 06:50.247
I don't know.

06:50.440 --> 06:52.200
- What's wrong with her?
- I don't know.

06:52.360 --> 06:55.364
Tessa turned her into a rock
and kept her in a box for 2000 years.

06:55.600 --> 06:59.525
Probably went stir crazy, like those deserted
island guys that talk to volleyballs.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.051
I said, I don't know!

07:01.240 --> 07:05.211
You're telling me that this girl is the
only thing holding together the Other Side?

07:05.440 --> 07:09.331
- Yep. She's the anchor.
- Leave me alone.

07:09.520 --> 07:13.206
As long as she's alive, the Other Side
exists, we can keep trying to get Bonnie.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.482
I said, I don't know!

07:15.680 --> 07:19.002
Well, considering she's immortal,
I'd say we have plenty of opportunity.

07:19.200 --> 07:22.283
You'd think. Except last night
she stuck a hole in Silas's neck...

07:22.480 --> 07:25.882
sucked the cure out of him.
So she's not only nuts, she's mortal...

07:26.080 --> 07:30.404
which means we have to keep her human
heart beating until we get Bonnie back.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.284
How do you plan to do that?

07:32.480 --> 07:35.006
Silas pinky-promised he'd do a spell
to bring her back.

07:35.200 --> 07:38.727
Unfortunately, he's taking his sweet time
coming back to Mystic Falls.

07:43.040 --> 07:45.088
Ah, Amara, stop.

07:47.560 --> 07:49.085
No!

07:49.320 --> 07:55.009
No. No. Let me die. I want to die.

07:55.240 --> 07:58.722
Let's hope love is blind,
or at least deaf.

08:06.400 --> 08:10.564
It turns out that it's not gonna be
that easy to keep Amara alive.

08:10.960 --> 08:15.124
I wonder what will happen, if she dies
and the Other Side gets destroyed.

08:15.320 --> 08:18.244
Do you think there'll be, like,
a white light and then nothing?

08:18.440 --> 08:22.126
It won't hurt, will it?
That would suck if it hurt.

08:22.480 --> 08:25.723
Bon, there's something I want to tell you.

08:26.680 --> 08:29.650
Actually, there are three things
that I want to tell you.

08:29.840 --> 08:31.808
Don't you dare give me a goodbye speech.

08:32.960 --> 08:35.566
This is not a goodbye.
That's the first thing.

08:36.080 --> 08:39.801
I know one way or another
that you will always be here.

08:40.960 --> 08:45.807
The second is,
thank you for giving your life up for me.

08:46.320 --> 08:47.526
Jer.

08:47.720 --> 08:51.406
- And the third is...
- Wait. Don't tell me.

08:51.680 --> 08:54.445
If you don't tell me,
we'll have to wait until another time.

08:54.640 --> 08:57.166
Which means there'll be another time.

08:58.480 --> 09:00.005
I'm not sure it works like that.

09:01.360 --> 09:05.684
Just go with it, okay?

09:18.360 --> 09:23.890
So, what am I looking at here, hmm?
Blood clot? Tumor? What?

09:24.120 --> 09:27.647
I did a full workup on your
blood, Katherine. It's clean.

09:27.840 --> 09:30.286
My hair is going gray
and my teeth are falling out.

09:30.480 --> 09:32.960
I'm not sure what that suggests,
but it's not health.

09:33.320 --> 09:37.291
Patient is irritable.
Unsure if this is a symptom or personality.

09:39.640 --> 09:43.690
Personality. Now tell me exactly
what the hell is going on with me.

09:44.040 --> 09:46.122
- You're aging.
- What?

09:46.320 --> 09:49.722
You said you were turned into a vampire
500 years ago, give or take.

09:50.680 --> 09:55.208
And now that you're human, let's just
say time is catching up with you.

09:59.800 --> 10:04.044
Okay. Okay. Well, how do we stop it?

10:04.240 --> 10:08.882
We don't. It's just life running its course.
Quicker than normal.

10:09.920 --> 10:11.046
How much quicker?

10:11.920 --> 10:15.049
If it continues at this rate,
you have a few months.

10:16.400 --> 10:17.731
I'm sorry.

10:30.360 --> 10:33.364
- Hello, Damon.
- Well, look who decided to pick up his phone.

10:33.560 --> 10:35.688
Is your secretary out sick?

10:35.880 --> 10:38.690
They prefer "administrative assistants,"
thank you very much.

10:38.880 --> 10:41.201
Learned that on the bus.
Very nice people on here.

10:41.400 --> 10:42.526
You're taking a bus?

10:42.720 --> 10:45.326
Not to sound like a dick,
but we're in a rush over here.

10:45.520 --> 10:48.729
Yeah, but you know what's great
about the bus? Open road, Damon.

10:48.920 --> 10:53.482
All this time to think. Watch everyday
human beings in their normal environment.

10:53.680 --> 10:57.605
Did you know that gas
is over $3 a gallon at the moment?

10:57.840 --> 10:59.808
Seems to really concern a lot of people.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.889
Not a time to have an everyman crisis.

11:02.080 --> 11:05.289
We need you to resurrect Bonnie
before your nutter-butter soul mate...

11:05.480 --> 11:07.562
offs herself and
destroys the Other Side.

11:07.760 --> 11:11.162
Yeah, I've been thinking about that.
Amara needs to die.

11:11.800 --> 11:14.280
- Pardon me?
- My poor Amara.

11:14.520 --> 11:17.808
All those years trapped in stone
clearly left her unhinged.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.401
If she doesn't want to spend
another moment on this earth...

11:20.600 --> 11:24.605
I'm happy to put her out of her misery and
spend eternity in the afterlife with her.

11:24.800 --> 11:28.646
If you wanna go ahead and kill her and
save me the trouble, please, by all means.

11:28.840 --> 11:33.971
Not until you bring Bonnie back, remember?
Promises made, metaphorical hands shook.

11:34.160 --> 11:35.730
<i>Been thinking about that too.</i>

11:35.960 --> 11:39.681
Remember I told you the universe was working
to draw our doppelgangers together...

11:39.920 --> 11:41.251
and you laughed in my face?

11:41.440 --> 11:45.365
Well, if you don't bring Bonnie back,
you'll be breaking your promise to Elena.

11:45.560 --> 11:51.841
And the idea of jeopardizing your relationship
brings me this perverse amount of joy...

11:52.040 --> 11:54.008
so I've decided not to help you, Damon.

11:54.480 --> 11:59.771
And I will see you soon. I'm looking
forward to all this being over. Bye.

12:07.120 --> 12:10.442
Hey, Jesse.
You missed our study session. Again.

12:10.640 --> 12:14.122
Where are you?
Look, I'm really worried. Just call me.

12:14.320 --> 12:16.482
Well, that was pathetic.

12:17.880 --> 12:21.566
- Um, I'm sorry?
- Leaving a message for a boy...

12:21.800 --> 12:26.840
who... What's the American phrase?
Oh.... is just not that into you.

12:28.440 --> 12:29.487
Who are you?

12:30.000 --> 12:32.128
I'm looking for Katherine Pierce.

12:32.680 --> 12:35.160
I heard she was living here,
so I checked your room.

12:35.360 --> 12:39.126
- What...? You went into my room?
- Do you know where she is or not?

12:39.520 --> 12:43.969
- Great. Even Katherine's friends are bitches.
- I'm not a friend.

12:46.360 --> 12:48.647
- You're kidding me.
- I need to speak with you.

12:48.840 --> 12:51.810
- Um, how do you two know each other?
- Katherine is my...

12:52.040 --> 12:56.329
She's my stylist. Ahem. She cuts my hair.

12:56.520 --> 12:58.761
Okay. Whatever.

13:01.520 --> 13:04.410
So, what do you want?

13:04.600 --> 13:07.331
Sit. You've been avoiding me.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.522
I've been a busy girl, doing busy things.

13:11.720 --> 13:12.926
Sit.

13:18.400 --> 13:21.051
We need to buy some more time.
Protect Amara.

13:21.240 --> 13:22.890
We should move her somewhere else.

13:23.080 --> 13:26.482
Silas is a witch. He's a living,
breathing GPS tracking device.

13:26.680 --> 13:29.650
- He'll track her wherever we take her.
- Can't let him near her...

13:29.840 --> 13:32.411
- until he brings Bonnie back.
- Weren't you listening?

13:32.600 --> 13:35.604
- He's not gonna bring her back.
- So, what, I should just give up?

13:36.280 --> 13:38.931
Come on, Stefan,
you got your memory back.

13:39.400 --> 13:42.290
You know me,
probably better than anyone else.

13:42.480 --> 13:44.528
Do you really think that I'm gonna give up?

13:44.760 --> 13:48.082
You're right. I do know you. You put
your hope in all the wrong places...

13:48.280 --> 13:50.408
and sometimes in the wrong people.

13:50.640 --> 13:53.883
Silas needs to die
and put us all out of our misery.

13:54.080 --> 13:58.369
So long as he's alive, I'm holding
out hope that he can still help us.

13:58.600 --> 14:02.002
As someone who spent months at the
bottom of a quarry because of the guy...

14:02.200 --> 14:04.441
I wouldn't hold your breath.
Pun intended.

14:04.640 --> 14:08.122
Silas needs to die and I need to be
the one to kill him. End of story.

14:19.800 --> 14:22.007
How's our mental patient doing?

14:23.240 --> 14:26.005
I guess all those years alone
sent her over the edge.

14:32.640 --> 14:36.326
Relax. I'm just bringing dinner.

14:39.440 --> 14:40.930
I know you.

14:41.120 --> 14:42.929
I don't think so.

14:44.320 --> 14:45.526
You're the hunter.

14:47.480 --> 14:48.641
I never forget a face.

14:50.320 --> 14:52.084
But Silas killed you.

14:52.320 --> 14:53.367
You're dead.

14:54.360 --> 14:57.170
I was, but I came back.

14:59.760 --> 15:00.807
How?

15:02.480 --> 15:03.811
I said, how?

15:06.880 --> 15:11.283
It was you, wasn't it?
You're a witch. You brought him back.

15:11.480 --> 15:13.642
- You can see me?
- Of course I can see you.

15:13.840 --> 15:16.161
I'm not blind. I have eyes.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.008
Or are you dead?

15:20.200 --> 15:23.283
I get mixed up. I can't tell the difference
between living or dead.

15:23.520 --> 15:25.284
Can you see people on the Other Side?

15:25.520 --> 15:30.242
I'm the anchor to the Other Side.
I can see everything.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.289
Ah! Don't touch me.
Please, don't... Don't touch me.

15:37.480 --> 15:39.244
I can touch her.

15:39.440 --> 15:42.410
Okay, that's weird.

15:43.520 --> 15:47.047
Jer, I think I've got an idea.

15:50.240 --> 15:52.686
Amara could see Bonnie
and Bonnie could touch her.

15:52.880 --> 15:54.211
They made physical contact.

15:54.400 --> 15:57.688
It's like Amara's got a foot
on each side or something.

15:57.880 --> 16:02.044
Amara exists in both places at once?
Here and the Other Side?

16:02.240 --> 16:04.004
Then she's not "crazy" crazy...

16:04.200 --> 16:07.522
she's just talking to dead
supernatural beings in our basement.

16:07.720 --> 16:08.767
That's not the point.

16:08.960 --> 16:13.409
The point is, if Silas isn't gonna help us,
what if Bonnie could be the same thing?

16:13.600 --> 16:15.682
What if she existed on both sides at once?

16:15.880 --> 16:19.248
- What if she became the anchor?
- You're right.

16:19.760 --> 16:24.527
Jeremy, you're right. So all we would need
is someone who could do that spell.

16:24.720 --> 16:27.371
- Don't say who I think you're gonna say.
- Think about it.

16:27.560 --> 16:28.971
Silas wants Amara to die.

16:29.160 --> 16:30.685
And Amara wants Amara to die.

16:30.920 --> 16:36.086
So who besides us is the one person with the
biggest stake against letting that happen?

16:40.080 --> 16:41.570
I was hoping we could talk.

16:41.760 --> 16:44.889
And I was hoping
you were my Chinese food. Goodbye.

16:47.240 --> 16:51.006
You remember Amara? Brunette, brown eyes,
I'm surprisingly not in love with her?

16:52.280 --> 16:53.645
What about her?

16:53.840 --> 16:59.051
Well, she took the cure,
she wants to die, and we have her.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.445
- But she's alive?
- For now.

17:01.840 --> 17:06.289
Silas is literally on his way to kill her. He's
obsessed with destroying the Other Side...

17:06.920 --> 17:11.243
so that he and Amara can live
happily ever after in the great beyond.

17:11.440 --> 17:14.444
You were right about doppelgangers.
They always end up together.

17:14.960 --> 17:16.962
So how does it feel to say "I told you so"?

17:18.400 --> 17:21.608
Like I want to shoot fireballs at Silas
and drown him in acid.

17:21.800 --> 17:25.805
That's what I thought. So how would
you feel about us making a deal?

17:29.800 --> 17:32.565
Haven't you heard it's bad luck
to kill your doppelganger?

17:34.200 --> 17:38.683
Yeah, well, if I don't kill him, he wins.

17:39.840 --> 17:41.729
And what if he kills you first?

17:43.320 --> 17:46.324
Witches aren't exactly easy to take down.

17:46.640 --> 17:48.449
We just got you back, Stefan.

17:49.160 --> 17:51.322
Don't do anything crazy.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.606
You and I have been down
the revenge road...

17:54.840 --> 17:56.330
and it's not worth it.

17:57.440 --> 18:01.764
You know,
there were these moments in that safe...

18:02.960 --> 18:05.804
this stillness in time...

18:06.000 --> 18:09.447
when I was dead, right before I
was about to come back to life.

18:10.000 --> 18:13.607
I would think about things in the past
that made me happy.

18:14.440 --> 18:16.363
Things that gave me hope.

18:18.920 --> 18:21.924
All these things kept me sane.

18:23.080 --> 18:24.889
They pushed me to hang on...

18:25.120 --> 18:30.411
when all I wanted to do
was give up and turn off my humanity.

18:31.480 --> 18:35.087
But eventually, the pain,
it took those moments away from me too.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.369
I'm so sorry.

18:39.920 --> 18:45.404
Every time I close my eyes,
I can see Silas stabbing me.

18:45.920 --> 18:48.287
I can feel myself drowning.

18:48.520 --> 18:50.124
And I need to make it stop.

18:51.400 --> 18:55.564
If I don't kill him, I'm gonna lose my
mind, or I'm gonna turn off my humanity...

18:57.560 --> 18:59.050
or both.

18:59.880 --> 19:02.929
So here's my pitch.
In order to keep the Other Side in place...

19:03.160 --> 19:05.367
you need something
to anchor the spell, right?

19:05.560 --> 19:08.086
Something powerful,
like an immortal-being powerful.

19:08.280 --> 19:11.329
Now, Amara was obviously a great choice
until she downed the cure.

19:11.520 --> 19:13.568
Would you consider someone who's dead...

19:13.760 --> 19:15.842
but stuck on the Other Side
a viable candidate?

19:16.040 --> 19:17.201
An anchor swap?

19:17.400 --> 19:18.811
Because I got a volunteer.

19:20.840 --> 19:24.367
I'd be making a ghost a human tollbooth
between our side and the Other Side.

19:24.600 --> 19:27.080
Giving her power to interact
with our physical world...

19:27.280 --> 19:30.250
- ...and the supernatural purgatory.
- So, what's the problem?

19:30.480 --> 19:33.768
I need a massive amount of power
to do a transfer spell like that.

19:33.960 --> 19:36.440
- Fine. Name your poison.
- I need something to draw on.

19:36.640 --> 19:38.563
- Mm-hm.
- Moon's not full.

19:38.760 --> 19:41.491
I don't think there's a worthy comet
for a couple billion years.

19:41.680 --> 19:45.048
Think hard. I have a girlfriend at home
who misses her best friend...

19:45.280 --> 19:48.045
and a wacky stowaway on suicide watch.
It's ridiculous.

19:48.240 --> 19:52.290
Doppelgangers. They're powerful,
mystical, naturally recurring.

19:52.480 --> 19:55.768
You want doppelganger blood?
I got doppelgangers coming out of my ears.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.890
How many you want?

19:59.200 --> 20:02.841
You hate junk food.
You call it toxic poison.

20:03.040 --> 20:05.361
Yeah, well, I've decided to live a little.

20:05.880 --> 20:09.009
Now, may I be excused,
scary vampire daughter?

20:09.360 --> 20:13.570
- You've been avoiding me. I don't like it.
- Clearly.

20:15.800 --> 20:20.761
We had a moment, you and I.
There was a bond. I felt it.

20:20.960 --> 20:24.965
And then, nothing.
You abandoned me all over again.

20:25.320 --> 20:28.483
Okay, first of all, I never abandoned you.

20:28.960 --> 20:31.327
You were snatched out
of my arms at birth...

20:31.520 --> 20:34.000
because my father
thought I was a shameful slut.

20:34.200 --> 20:37.124
And second of all, it's been 500 years.

20:37.320 --> 20:40.483
Do we really have to do this whole
mother-daughter bonding thing?

20:40.680 --> 20:42.808
Estrangement is much easier,
don't you think?

20:44.400 --> 20:46.880
Sorry to interrupt
the world's weirdest lunch...

20:47.080 --> 20:50.289
but you with the doppelganger blood,
duty calls.

20:50.480 --> 20:53.529
Wonderful.
Now that Katherine's a human and fragile...

20:53.720 --> 20:56.690
everyone thinks that they can just
boss her around.

20:57.680 --> 20:59.011
Hands off, okay? I'm going.

20:59.200 --> 21:02.522
- We're not done.
- Oh, yes, we are.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.401
So you live in this giant mansion...

21:09.600 --> 21:12.809
with two doppelgangers
that are destined to end up together.

21:14.280 --> 21:16.328
I swear there's a sitcom
in there somewhere.

21:16.520 --> 21:19.888
So where's the ancient
boyfriend-stealing bitch?

21:20.520 --> 21:21.965
This way.

21:28.880 --> 21:30.644
That'll be all.

21:40.640 --> 21:45.248
Well, if it isn't the face that launched
a thousand doppelgangers.

21:48.400 --> 21:52.086
A little birdie told me you weren't
enjoying your immortal life.

21:55.320 --> 21:58.210
Two thousand years,
you have nothing to say to me?

21:58.560 --> 22:00.722
No apology?

22:03.920 --> 22:05.410
I'm sorry.

22:05.920 --> 22:09.402
- What was that?
- I'm sorry.

22:10.200 --> 22:11.486
Ah.

22:12.240 --> 22:14.481
That is what you want to hear, isn't it?

22:15.080 --> 22:16.605
How I have suffered?

22:16.800 --> 22:21.089
How every moment of my life
has been a living hell? It has.

22:23.520 --> 22:28.208
My sin was falling in love,
and I've learned my lesson.

22:28.600 --> 22:30.250
You win.

22:32.480 --> 22:34.448
You win, now, please kill me.

22:35.360 --> 22:36.850
Please.

22:37.760 --> 22:39.125
Please kill me.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.644
Don't worry.

22:43.760 --> 22:47.162
When I make someone else the anchor,
I will.

22:47.360 --> 22:50.250
And since you're nothing more
than a non-supernatural human...

22:50.440 --> 22:53.523
you'll pass on while Silas
is trapped on the Other Side.

22:53.800 --> 22:57.043
And then you and Silas...

22:57.960 --> 23:00.281
you're gonna spend eternity apart.

23:02.800 --> 23:07.442
And that is gonna be kind of fantastic
for me.

23:09.920 --> 23:12.161
Selfishly speaking.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.449
The cute one's here.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.971
- She's all yours.
- Let me guess. You must be...

23:23.520 --> 23:26.126
- ...who now?
- Let's be clear.

23:26.320 --> 23:29.449
I don't care about Bonnie Bennett
or the Other Side going away...

23:29.640 --> 23:31.563
or Elena getting her best friend back.

23:32.320 --> 23:35.802
You want something. I'm shocked.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.810
I had the cure you created
running through my veins...

23:39.000 --> 23:41.731
and when Silas sucked it out of me...

23:42.160 --> 23:45.960
I started aging. Faster than normal.

23:46.160 --> 23:49.369
So basically, I'm dying,
and I need you to fix me.

23:50.160 --> 23:54.484
You made the cure,
now make something that stops the aging.

23:54.680 --> 23:57.331
Otherwise, no blood for you.

23:58.360 --> 24:03.002
Fine. When the ritual is finished,
and Bonnie is the anchor...

24:03.200 --> 24:06.329
- ...I'll find a way to stop you from dying.
- Thank you.

24:06.520 --> 24:08.682
Now, where's Tweedledee and Tweedledum?

24:16.600 --> 24:18.807
- What is that?
- It's Bonnie's Grimoire.

24:19.000 --> 24:23.881
- A grim what?
- It's a magic spell book. Ugh. Idiot.

24:24.080 --> 24:27.050
It's a talisman.
Since Bonnie can't be here...

24:27.240 --> 24:30.926
her Grimoire will have to do.
Hands in, palms up.

24:39.240 --> 24:41.163
I'm sorry, love, did that hurt?

24:42.400 --> 24:44.243
I've been through worse.

24:44.440 --> 24:47.410
Easy. Okay? I'm fragile these days.

25:05.760 --> 25:07.444
Show-off.

25:29.800 --> 25:31.689
- No.
- Is it done?

25:31.920 --> 25:33.410
No, it's not done.

25:44.880 --> 25:48.168
- What is happening?
- Silas is happening.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.721
Show yourself, bastard!

25:58.040 --> 26:00.361
I can't see anything. Can you?

26:00.920 --> 26:03.605
Electricity's out in the whole house.
What happened?

26:03.800 --> 26:06.451
- Silas is here.
- Well, Silas owes me a fuse box.

26:08.240 --> 26:11.369
Hang on. I only count two doppelgangers.

26:11.560 --> 26:14.325
- Where's crazy pants?
- And where's the other crazy?

26:25.840 --> 26:29.128
- That was quite the show, Silas.
- Thank you.

26:29.320 --> 26:32.290
You haven't seen the love of my life
running around, have you?

26:32.520 --> 26:35.603
Nope. Maybe you shouldn't have
turned the lights off, genius.

26:37.520 --> 26:42.003
You've had 2000 years to watch us suffer.
You've had your fun.

26:42.240 --> 26:45.847
- Why can't you just let it go?
- Maybe I'm just not wired that way.

26:49.440 --> 26:51.761
Honestly, I feel sorry for you.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.480
Hateful vengeance is for people
without real love.

27:01.360 --> 27:06.161
You spent 2000 years waiting for me to die
just so you could be with me.

27:06.640 --> 27:10.361
When all along, the universe knew
I belonged with somebody else.

27:10.600 --> 27:14.844
Doesn't that make your whole existence,
like, I don't know...

27:15.040 --> 27:16.166
a total waste?

27:17.480 --> 27:20.768
- I loved you.
- Yeah. Well, get in line.

27:23.880 --> 27:26.281
- Sucky timing, Stefan.
<i>- I</i> disagree.

27:26.480 --> 27:29.689
I have Amara beyond the property line.
You have 10 minutes to find us.

27:29.880 --> 27:33.202
Well, I'm a little busy right now
watching my nemesis bite it.

27:33.400 --> 27:36.324
- Plus, I have no interest in saving Amara's life.
- I know that.

27:36.520 --> 27:39.683
Which is why I'm gonna take her away,
keep her alive by any means...

27:39.920 --> 27:41.968
while everyone hunts you like an animal.

27:42.400 --> 27:44.721
<i>You now have nine minutes.</i>

27:49.920 --> 27:51.729
Katherine?

27:52.720 --> 27:54.768
What are you doing?

27:54.960 --> 27:58.203
Tessa's stupid non-surgical incision
won't stop bleeding.

27:59.720 --> 28:01.722
Here. Heal.

28:09.680 --> 28:11.364
What's wrong?

28:11.560 --> 28:15.360
Nothing. Just another tragic side effect
from taking that cure.

28:15.560 --> 28:19.246
Apparently, the universe just doesn't
want me to heal from vampire blood.

28:19.440 --> 28:24.321
Stupid universe. Find me that damn witch
so she can finish that spell.

28:29.560 --> 28:32.325
No. No way.

28:35.480 --> 28:40.281
- Can't a witch rest in peace?
- It's a flesh wound. Get up.

28:41.840 --> 28:44.684
You're not done yet. Come on.

28:56.640 --> 28:58.005
Amara.

29:07.520 --> 29:09.329
I loved you.

29:11.560 --> 29:13.403
I still do.

29:16.560 --> 29:19.928
But I can't live any longer.

29:23.560 --> 29:25.642
Please understand.

29:40.320 --> 29:42.243
I understand.

29:44.960 --> 29:46.849
I love you.

30:12.120 --> 30:14.122
Silas, please.

30:15.720 --> 30:17.688
I'm ready.

30:29.120 --> 30:30.451
Do you remember me?

30:32.280 --> 30:34.487
I remember you.

30:38.160 --> 30:40.561
Oh, I'm sorry, is it hard to breathe?

30:42.000 --> 30:46.085
Is your throat closing? Did the fear
of dying start to creep in yet?

30:55.920 --> 30:59.049
I hear every emotion is heightened
for a vampire.

30:59.600 --> 31:03.161
All those memories must be
eating you alive right now, Stefan.

31:03.360 --> 31:07.445
What's it like to die? I've never done it.
You must have done it, what...

31:07.640 --> 31:10.086
- ...a thousand times over the summer?
- Stop it.

31:10.280 --> 31:13.329
Stop? I spent 2000 years alone in a tomb.

31:14.000 --> 31:16.367
You were locked up for, what,
three months?

31:17.040 --> 31:19.520
Look at you. You're a mess.

31:20.480 --> 31:24.087
The safe was the easy part, wasn't it?
Being forgotten about...

31:24.280 --> 31:26.044
that's the real torture, isn't it?

31:31.600 --> 31:33.204
Silas.

31:43.200 --> 31:45.168
Stefan and Amara are not inside.

31:45.640 --> 31:49.201
Because Stefan took her. You have to
find him before he gets himself killed.

31:49.400 --> 31:52.483
He's luring Silas away so we can finish this.
He'll be fine.

31:52.720 --> 31:54.404
He's hurting.

31:55.360 --> 31:57.328
<i>Damon, he's not thinking clearly.</i>

31:57.560 --> 32:02.521
Okay, Silas may have put him in that safe,
but we were supposed to get him out of it.

32:02.720 --> 32:06.247
Please, go find him.
We can't lose him again.

32:08.680 --> 32:09.727
Okay.

32:31.400 --> 32:33.528
Our eternity starts now.

32:40.080 --> 32:42.811
No. Amara.

32:43.280 --> 32:44.645
No. Amara.

32:44.920 --> 32:48.083
Amara. Drink this. Drink.

32:48.760 --> 32:49.807
Little more.

32:51.960 --> 32:54.611
No, no, no. Okay? No. Hey.

32:55.040 --> 32:57.964
Stay with me. Look at me.
Look at me. Amara.

32:58.400 --> 33:01.244
Amara. Hey. Look at me.

33:04.480 --> 33:08.201
I've been in hell for 2000 years.

33:08.400 --> 33:11.006
What's another five minutes, huh? Hey.

33:12.240 --> 33:15.289
- Let me die.
- No. Amara.

33:15.480 --> 33:18.165
Come on. Please.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.684
I came to say goodbye.

33:28.480 --> 33:31.086
What are you talking about?
Tessa's doing the spell.

33:31.320 --> 33:34.130
- Amara's dying, Jer.
- No.

33:35.440 --> 33:39.968
- That's impossible. Damon...
- Stop. We don't have much time.

33:49.320 --> 33:53.211
Amara. Amara. Please. Amara.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.048
Tell me the third thing.

34:00.960 --> 34:05.409
- Bon.
- Tell me. Please.

34:11.440 --> 34:15.331
- I love you.
- I love you too.

34:15.520 --> 34:17.568
I'm not ready to let you go.

34:23.560 --> 34:25.562
I can feel you.

34:26.400 --> 34:27.686
I can feel you.

34:29.600 --> 34:31.011
Bonnie?

34:35.920 --> 34:38.321
Please tell me this is real.

34:40.120 --> 34:41.531
You guys can see me?

34:42.520 --> 34:46.605
- Bonnie, it worked.
- Ha, ha. It worked. It worked.

34:46.920 --> 34:48.967
- You're here.
- Thank you.

34:49.159 --> 34:50.764
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

34:50.960 --> 34:53.246
And we can be roommates.
We have that extra bed.

34:53.480 --> 34:55.880
- We can clear out half the closet...
- Caroline.

34:56.080 --> 34:59.926
Sorry. I'm just...
I can't believe you're really here.

35:00.880 --> 35:02.564
I'm here.

35:05.400 --> 35:07.289
I'm back.

35:15.600 --> 35:21.050
I missed this. I missed feeling warm.

35:22.360 --> 35:27.048
- I never felt warm on the Other Side.
- I missed this.

35:29.360 --> 35:31.362
Holding your hand.

35:33.680 --> 35:35.887
I am never gonna let you go again.

35:51.240 --> 35:55.768
Okay. I'm ready. Let's do this.

35:56.000 --> 35:58.890
You. Right.

35:59.080 --> 36:02.527
You want me to stop the aging?
I'd find a drugstore cream.

36:04.200 --> 36:08.250
Hilarious. But the thing is,
I'm not getting any younger, so...

36:08.480 --> 36:09.561
spell away.

36:09.760 --> 36:13.685
Altering someone's lifespan is what started
this whole mess in the first place.

36:14.280 --> 36:18.251
I've learned my lesson.
I'm not saving your life.

36:18.640 --> 36:19.846
Excuse me?

36:21.800 --> 36:23.723
I won.

36:24.080 --> 36:26.208
Amara is gone.

36:26.400 --> 36:30.041
And Silas is waiting for me
on the Other Side.

36:37.840 --> 36:40.207
No. No!

36:41.240 --> 36:43.925
Help. Help! Somebody help her!
She's dying!

36:44.120 --> 36:47.647
- Don't die. I need you.
- True love prevails.

36:48.960 --> 36:52.089
- Universe be damned.
- No!

36:52.760 --> 36:54.330
No.

36:59.880 --> 37:01.325
You're the anchor now.

37:02.520 --> 37:04.090
Tessa.

37:04.880 --> 37:08.123
- Where did you just come from?
- I'm dead.

37:09.880 --> 37:13.407
As I pass through you,
you'll feel my death.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.411
You'll feel every death.

37:16.720 --> 37:22.204
Every supernatural being that passes over
to the Other Side will pass through you.

37:24.000 --> 37:28.403
Sorry. That's gonna hurt like a bitch.

37:39.840 --> 37:44.926
- So he's dead. It's over.
- Yeah, it's over.

37:45.880 --> 37:48.850
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

37:49.040 --> 37:52.442
Look at me and tell me
that killing Silas worked.

37:52.640 --> 37:56.440
- That you'll be okay now.
- Why is this so important to you?

37:56.640 --> 37:59.723
- Because I know how much he stole from you.
- Yeah, and he's dead.

37:59.960 --> 38:03.089
And because while you were suffering
in that safe...

38:03.280 --> 38:06.921
grasping onto hope,
fighting every second...

38:07.720 --> 38:09.802
so that you wouldn't
lose your humanity...

38:11.440 --> 38:12.805
I was happy.

38:13.920 --> 38:16.491
I got everything that I wanted, Stefan.

38:17.800 --> 38:21.088
I got to be in love.
I got the summer of my dreams.

38:21.280 --> 38:22.725
I got Bonnie back.

38:24.440 --> 38:26.647
So I need to know that this worked.

38:28.640 --> 38:32.122
I need to know that it's gonna take away
all of your suffering.

38:33.600 --> 38:36.001
I need to know that you're gonna be okay.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.082
I wanted it to be you.

38:43.200 --> 38:46.647
When that safe finally opened
and somebody found me...

38:48.920 --> 38:50.285
I wanted it to be you.

38:56.120 --> 38:58.168
I wanted it to be both of you.

39:11.640 --> 39:13.005
<i>Hey-</i>

39:13.280 --> 39:17.842
- Um, now that Bonnie's back...
- Your room is full.

39:18.280 --> 39:20.681
Got it. I'll just get my stuff.

39:20.960 --> 39:24.009
- Thank you. For what you did today...
- Enough.

39:24.560 --> 39:27.291
I killed you once. Don't forget.

39:27.480 --> 39:31.530
- We still hate each other, okay?
- Yes, you did.

39:31.760 --> 39:32.966
And, yes, we do.

39:40.360 --> 39:42.522
Where the hell is my bag?

39:44.000 --> 39:45.729
Already packed.

39:48.960 --> 39:50.564
You again?

39:52.720 --> 39:56.884
I'm leaving, Katherine.
I'm heading back to Prague.

39:57.120 --> 39:59.407
And I'd really like it
if you came with me.

40:00.720 --> 40:04.281
We can go to Bulgaria.
Retrace our lives.

40:04.480 --> 40:07.404
I don't know what kind of twisted fantasy
you have about us...

40:08.080 --> 40:11.004
but that's all it is. A fantasy.

40:12.480 --> 40:17.168
I would rather rip my own heart out than do
more mother-daughter bonding with you.

40:17.360 --> 40:21.410
And I'm human now,
so it wouldn't really be that easy.

40:22.880 --> 40:24.450
I don't want to know you.

40:25.240 --> 40:28.050
Mother-daughter? She's your...?

40:28.320 --> 40:29.606
Oh. Wow.

40:32.120 --> 40:34.282
I'm doing you a favor, Nadia.

40:35.920 --> 40:37.490
Okay?

40:38.480 --> 40:39.720
I can't be there for you.

40:42.480 --> 40:44.960
So take a good look...

40:46.000 --> 40:48.048
because you are never
gonna see me again.

41:08.640 --> 41:10.051
Hello, my shadow self.

41:14.240 --> 41:16.481
<i>Look at me and tell me
that you'll be okay now.</i>

41:19.160 --> 41:20.650
<i>He's dead. It's over.</i>

41:25.520 --> 41:27.284
<i>It's over.</i>

41:37.640 --> 41:39.165
No.

41:41.600 --> 41:42.806
No.

41:44.320 --> 41:48.245
It's over. It's supposed to be over.
