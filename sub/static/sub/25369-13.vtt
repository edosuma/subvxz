00:01.752 --> 00:03.545
[Living Brain]
Finally, Spider‐Man,

00:03.545 --> 00:06.340
my sweet revenge
is about to be complete.

00:06.340 --> 00:10.511
Your little friend
can't help you now, web‐head.

00:10.511 --> 00:12.179
Doctor Octopus.

00:12.179 --> 00:15.557
I don't believe it.
Is it really you?

00:15.557 --> 00:17.893
Who else would it be?

00:17.893 --> 00:20.479
My real body
might remain in a coma,

00:20.479 --> 00:24.525
but this metal shell houses
my most valuable asset‐‐

00:24.525 --> 00:26.068
my mind.
[groans]

00:26.068 --> 00:27.819
Downloading
human consciousness...

00:27.819 --> 00:29.696
[grunts]
into a robot body?

00:29.696 --> 00:33.325
That's supposed...
[grunts]
to be impossible.

00:33.325 --> 00:35.160
Nothing is impossible.

00:35.160 --> 00:39.164
It was a simple matter
of amalgamating the encoded‐‐

00:39.164 --> 00:43.335
Wait. I know what
you're doing, Spider‐Man.

00:43.335 --> 00:46.672
What?
I'm seriously interested.

00:46.672 --> 00:48.090
Please, go on.

00:48.090 --> 00:51.593
You are only attempting
to buy yourself time.

00:51.593 --> 00:56.223
But time is a luxury
no longer available to you.

00:59.810 --> 01:00.978
[grunts]

01:00.978 --> 01:03.480
Aahh!
Mental feedback!

01:03.480 --> 01:05.482
[groaning]

01:05.482 --> 01:08.151
Let's get you outta here.
[groans]

01:12.114 --> 01:16.118
There is no escape
from me, Spider‐Man.

01:16.118 --> 01:18.036
You'll thank me
for this later!

01:19.746 --> 01:22.207
[grunts]

01:24.501 --> 01:27.504
[grunting]
[laughing]

01:28.839 --> 01:30.841
[pants, grunts]

01:30.841 --> 01:34.094
Being a robot hasn't made you
any less creepy, Ock.
[grunts]

01:34.094 --> 01:38.599
This shell was a necessary tool
to focus on my mission‐‐

01:38.599 --> 01:41.018
revenge against you.

01:41.018 --> 01:45.272
Oh, how delightful it was
to hide in plain sight...

01:45.272 --> 01:47.274
[laughing]

01:47.274 --> 01:49.776
masterminding all of this.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.445
[grunting]
All I was missing

01:51.445 --> 01:53.572
was this
Energy Focal Device

01:53.572 --> 01:55.949
I once designed
for Osborn.

01:55.949 --> 01:59.202
It gives my robotic form
the power it needs

01:59.202 --> 02:03.040
for my endgame
to come to fruition.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.042
Wait. So your big plan
was to...

02:05.042 --> 02:07.085
[grunts]
use some gizmo to zap me?

02:07.085 --> 02:08.962
This is...
[grunts]

02:08.962 --> 02:11.798
a lot of effort to go through
for one of your same old moves.

02:11.798 --> 02:15.344
Oh, no.
This is so much more.

02:15.344 --> 02:20.140
I am going to destroy
the very essence
of who you are.

02:20.140 --> 02:25.562
I am going to take absolutely
everything away from you,

02:25.562 --> 02:29.775
like you took everything
away from me.
[screaming]

02:42.704 --> 02:44.247
[screaming]

02:45.499 --> 02:49.252
[grunts]
Oh, do not worry,
Spider‐Man.

02:49.252 --> 02:53.131
The suffering
will not last long.

02:53.131 --> 02:57.844
[groans]
You have terrible
bedside manner, Doc.

02:57.844 --> 03:00.013
[grunts]

03:01.223 --> 03:02.724
Blast it!

03:02.724 --> 03:03.892
[groans]

03:03.892 --> 03:06.311
Time to take this outside.
[grunts]

03:06.311 --> 03:08.188
You infuriate me!

03:12.901 --> 03:15.195
[grunts]

03:15.195 --> 03:17.406
Need to get Ock away from Miles.

03:17.406 --> 03:19.616
[groaning]

03:26.206 --> 03:27.999
[groaning continues]

03:27.999 --> 03:30.502
Your feeble attempts
to defeat me

03:30.502 --> 03:34.881
are only going to make
my victory all the sweeter.
[siren wailing]

03:37.926 --> 03:42.931
[groans]
This does not end here,
web‐head.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.724
[powering down]

03:49.312 --> 03:51.356
Trouble at Oscorp.

03:51.356 --> 03:55.402
Look who's here.
Big shock.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.529
[weakly]
Stop‐‐ Have to stop Ock.

03:57.529 --> 04:00.699
Inside...
My friend's inside.

04:00.699 --> 04:03.326
Where's SeÃ±or Trunks?
[exhales]

04:03.326 --> 04:05.954
Any idea what
he's talking about?

04:05.954 --> 04:08.248
Maybe Spidey's
finally lost his mind.

04:08.248 --> 04:11.877
Let's bring all this in
and let Chief Watanabe
sort out the mess.

04:11.877 --> 04:14.254
[scoffs]
You bring a forklift?

04:17.883 --> 04:20.677
Look at this crazy thing.

04:20.677 --> 04:24.890
Must be way too dangerous
to store in the normal
evidence lockup.

04:24.890 --> 04:28.685
That's one of the reasons
the city built this supervillain
holding facility.

04:28.685 --> 04:32.439
But all this mad science junk
freaks me out.

04:32.439 --> 04:36.067
[groans]
Can't wait to get back
to our usual beat.

04:36.067 --> 04:41.072
Give me a mugger any day
over all the superpowered
maniacs they keep here.

04:41.072 --> 04:42.365
Seriously.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.460
[man]
I'll tell you what.
[gasps]

04:53.460 --> 04:56.338
It's about time someone brought
this menace to justice.

04:56.338 --> 04:58.381
All he's ever done
is cause us trouble.

04:58.381 --> 05:00.425
I bet the chief's
not gonna keep
that spider dude

05:00.425 --> 05:02.427
in supervillain holding
for long.

05:02.427 --> 05:03.970
She'll send him
straight to the cellar.

05:03.970 --> 05:05.806
[quietly]
Spidey's in holding?

05:08.016 --> 05:10.268
[Chief Watanabe]
Wake up, sunshine!
[gasping]

05:10.268 --> 05:13.480
What?
[groans]
Where am I?

05:17.901 --> 05:22.113
[groans]
Cuffs? One‐way mirror?
Harsh lighting?

05:22.113 --> 05:26.076
Things aren't coming up
smelling like roses for Spidey,
are they, Chief Watanabe?

05:27.869 --> 05:30.038
No, Spider‐Man,
they are not.

05:30.038 --> 05:33.124
I was one of the only people
in the city defending you.

05:33.124 --> 05:36.336
I gave you a chance when
everyone else in the world
told me not to.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.421
I really appreciate that.

05:38.421 --> 05:41.383
And you showed that appreciation
by breaking into Oscorp

05:41.383 --> 05:42.801
and blowing up a lab?

05:42.801 --> 05:44.386
[sighs]

05:44.386 --> 05:46.221
This is gonna sound crazy,

05:46.221 --> 05:50.308
but remember when you told me
someone hired Chameleon?

05:50.308 --> 05:52.811
It was Doc Ock.
He's behind it all.

05:52.811 --> 05:56.731
I got a lead on that
Chameleon tech you showed me,
but when I went to investigate‐‐

05:56.731 --> 05:59.609
I told you not to investigate
anything without me.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.695
You promised me
you wouldn't.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.614
Right. Kind of forgot
about that.

06:04.614 --> 06:08.618
One of my officers said
you mentioned Otto Octavius,
so I checked up on him.

06:08.618 --> 06:11.246
And guess what?
He's still in a coma,

06:11.246 --> 06:13.415
like he has been
for a couple of months.

06:13.415 --> 06:15.584
It's way more complicated
than that.

06:15.584 --> 06:17.919
No, it's not. It's simple.

06:17.919 --> 06:21.923
I can no longer
let a vigilante like you
operate in our streets.

06:21.923 --> 06:24.426
I'm formally arresting you.

06:24.426 --> 06:27.304
And like any criminal
in our holding cell,

06:27.304 --> 06:30.015
there are no
secret identities.

06:30.015 --> 06:32.017
Unmask, Spider‐Man.

06:32.017 --> 06:34.311
It's time we found out
who you are.

06:36.938 --> 06:40.483
I‐‐ I can't.

06:40.483 --> 06:43.069
You're either gonna take
that mask off now,

06:43.069 --> 06:45.196
or I'm gonna remove it
by force.

06:45.196 --> 06:47.198
[sighs]

06:50.577 --> 06:54.039
[sighing]

06:54.039 --> 06:56.082
[alarm blaring]
What?

06:56.082 --> 06:58.043
Emergency power's kicked in.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.590
[alarm continues blaring]

07:08.678 --> 07:10.680
This can't be good.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.308
[grunts]

07:13.308 --> 07:15.727
Ow!
[groans]

07:15.727 --> 07:18.730
Okay. The supervillain
holding facility

07:18.730 --> 07:21.358
slams shut right when
Spidey's taken inside.

07:21.358 --> 07:23.526
Oh, no way this is
on the level.

07:23.526 --> 07:25.153
I need in!

07:25.153 --> 07:27.447
It's not just
emergency power.

07:27.447 --> 07:31.576
This is lockdown‐‐ a protocol
in case a supervillain
tries to escape.

07:31.576 --> 07:33.411
It wasn't me.
You're my witness

07:33.411 --> 07:35.580
for when J. Jonah Jameson
tries to blame this on me.

07:35.580 --> 07:38.166
[beeps]
Chief to Control.
Status report, now.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.293
He's probably blocking
the comm channel.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.628
You think someone's
hacked our system?

07:41.628 --> 07:44.714
Yeah.
And I have eight guesses
about who it is.

07:44.714 --> 07:49.427
<i>I told you there is no escape</i>
<i>from me, Spider‐Man.</i>

07:49.427 --> 07:52.347
<i>But now you have a mission.</i>

07:52.347 --> 07:53.932
<i>Come and find me.</i>

07:53.932 --> 07:56.393
<i>Face Doctor Octopus</i>

07:56.393 --> 07:58.520
<i>before I destroy</i>
<i>this building</i>

07:58.520 --> 08:00.605
<i>and everyone trapped inside.</i>

08:00.605 --> 08:02.607
Destroy them? How?

08:02.607 --> 08:06.403
<i>There was more than enough</i>
<i>tech in here to fashion a bomb.</i>

08:06.403 --> 08:10.865
<i>One with a countdown,</i>
<i>just to liven up</i>
<i>the entire situation.</i>

08:10.865 --> 08:15.245
<i>You have 15 minutes,</i>
<i>Spider‐Man.</i>
<i>[laughs]</i>

08:15.245 --> 08:17.247
Doesn't look like I'm gonna need
those other seven guesses.

08:20.709 --> 08:23.837
<i>[Living Brain]</i>
<i>The clock is ticking,</i>
<i>Spider‐Man.</i>

08:23.837 --> 08:26.047
<i>If you want to save the lives</i>

08:26.047 --> 08:29.843
<i>of everyone in this building,</i>
<i>come and find me.</i>

08:29.843 --> 08:33.304
Couldn't Ock get into
model trains or something?

08:33.304 --> 08:36.266
Why does his favorite hobby
have to be my destruction?

08:36.266 --> 08:39.477
Despite all logic,
looks like your claims
about Ock are true.

08:39.477 --> 08:44.023
Is it against the law to say,
"I told you so,"
to the chief of police?

08:44.023 --> 08:47.318
I should've trusted my gut,
Spider‐Man.

08:47.318 --> 08:49.320
I should've trusted you.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.364
How did Ock
even get inside here?

08:51.364 --> 08:54.659
Ock's mind
isn't inside his body.

08:54.659 --> 08:58.663
It's in the Living Brain,
the robot that was taken in
when I was arrested.

08:58.663 --> 09:01.583
The officers would've put it
in the evidence lockup.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.585
So let's do this.

09:03.585 --> 09:06.337
[straining]

09:08.757 --> 09:10.300
[grunts]

09:10.300 --> 09:12.093
All this...
[panting]

09:12.093 --> 09:14.220
spider strength and not...
[panting]

09:14.220 --> 09:16.097
even a dent?

09:16.097 --> 09:20.435
I guess this place was designed
to withstand
a superpowered attack.

09:20.435 --> 09:24.606
But maybe overloading
the energy supply
could pop this joint open.

09:24.606 --> 09:27.650
Electro‐sting time!

09:27.650 --> 09:29.611
[beeps]
<i>[Living Brain]</i>
<i>Where are you, Spider‐Man?</i>

09:29.611 --> 09:31.946
<i>Only 11 minutes left,</i>

09:31.946 --> 09:35.033
<i>so I would pick up the pace,</i>
<i>if I were you.</i>

09:35.033 --> 09:39.287
<i>So many innocent lives rest</i>
<i>in the hands of Doctor Octopus.</i>

09:39.287 --> 09:41.998
Doc Ock? Oh, man!

09:41.998 --> 09:45.585
This situation just got
every kind of even worse.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.795
[crying out]

09:46.795 --> 09:48.379
Aah!
[grunts]
[thud]

09:48.379 --> 09:51.049
[groaning]

09:51.049 --> 09:53.051
I'm gonna need some help.

09:53.051 --> 09:56.137
This is the fastest way.
Through the holding cells.

09:58.473 --> 10:02.018
Okay, what are the odds
those two open cells

10:02.018 --> 10:04.062
are for the inmates
on good behavior?

10:04.062 --> 10:06.606
Ock must've remotely
sprung the doors.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.399
Who was in them?

10:09.609 --> 10:11.611
Electrical insulation?
Scorch marks?

10:11.611 --> 10:14.489
Oh, this cell's gotta be
for someone who‐‐
[woman laughs]

10:14.489 --> 10:17.283
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.873
[laughs]

10:23.873 --> 10:27.710
Well, Electro, looks like you're
the bright spot in my day.

10:27.710 --> 10:29.379
[evil laughter]

10:30.421 --> 10:32.423
So what do you think?

10:32.423 --> 10:35.635
Did it occur to you that
reprogramming an access panel

10:35.635 --> 10:38.304
might be easier
before you fried it?

10:38.304 --> 10:40.598
I was conducting
an experiment.

10:40.598 --> 10:42.600
In conduction.
[sheepish chuckle]

10:42.600 --> 10:46.229
[scoffs]
How can Ock be in there, Miles?

10:46.229 --> 10:48.356
I saw him in a coma myself.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.733
It just doesn't
make any‐‐ Wait.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.032
[Miles]
Yes!

10:59.659 --> 11:01.244
No!

11:01.244 --> 11:03.246
[growls]

11:03.246 --> 11:05.790
So you're gonna be that way,
huh, door? Fine.

11:05.790 --> 11:08.835
We don't need you.
We can find a different way in.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.378
[laughs]

11:12.755 --> 11:16.426
[yells]
[grunting]

11:17.844 --> 11:19.762
You're falling apart,
Spidey.

11:19.762 --> 11:22.807
Plus, let's face it, loser,
you only beat me last time

11:22.807 --> 11:25.226
'cause you built
some fancy containment suit.

11:25.226 --> 11:28.646
But where's your suit now?

11:31.858 --> 11:34.235
I must have left it
at the dry cleaners.

11:34.235 --> 11:37.488
And since I don't think
you're gonna give me time
to go pick it up...

11:37.488 --> 11:39.824
[grunting]

11:39.824 --> 11:41.993
[yells]

11:41.993 --> 11:45.205
[yells, grunts]

11:46.789 --> 11:49.834
I thought I might try
a little web improvisation.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.754
Huh? Aah! Hot!
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!

11:52.754 --> 11:55.215
Spidey, get her contained!
I can't!

11:55.215 --> 11:59.135
She's right.
Last time I only beat her
because I had special equipment.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.304
We have special equipment
here too.

12:01.304 --> 12:03.556
Of course!

12:04.807 --> 12:06.851
Oh, no, you don't!

12:07.894 --> 12:09.437
[grunts]

12:10.939 --> 12:13.066
[yells]

12:13.066 --> 12:15.735
It's not as cool
as my Electro suit,
but it'll do.

12:15.735 --> 12:19.364
[both grunting]

12:19.364 --> 12:21.950
[growls]
Spider‐Man, I'll make you‐‐

12:21.950 --> 12:24.911
"Make you a nice
ice cream sundae,"
[blows landing]

12:24.911 --> 12:26.913
is how she was gonna
finish that sentence.

12:26.913 --> 12:29.123
Probably.

12:29.123 --> 12:30.291
[grunts]

12:30.291 --> 12:32.085
Taking the panel offline

12:32.085 --> 12:34.754
means Ock can't open it
remotely again.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.714
Good thinking, Chief.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.883
Guess we make
a pretty good team.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.927
Up high.
Maybe.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.805
But don't forget,
there were two open doors.
[sighs]

12:46.891 --> 12:48.935
[both panting]

12:48.935 --> 12:51.854
Whoa!
[groans]
Whoa, there, hero.

12:51.854 --> 12:55.942
Sorry. I've been going
nonstop for days.

12:55.942 --> 12:59.404
Passing out when they
arrested me is the closest thing
I've had to sleep in forever.

12:59.404 --> 13:02.949
[sighs]
I've been hammered by villain
after villain, day after day.

13:02.949 --> 13:05.201
I‐‐ I gotta be honest,
Chief.

13:05.201 --> 13:08.288
I don't know if I've got
the strength to do this.

13:08.288 --> 13:11.207
There's a reason I've held off
on bringing you in.

13:11.207 --> 13:13.293
I've been assembling
a file on you.

13:13.293 --> 13:16.796
And if there's one thing
everyone says about Spider‐Man,
it's that‐‐

13:16.796 --> 13:18.881
I'm really cute
and loveable?

13:18.881 --> 13:21.426
That when things
are at their worst,

13:21.426 --> 13:24.095
Spider‐Man always rises
to his best.

13:26.514 --> 13:29.767
You're‐‐ You're right.

13:29.767 --> 13:33.521
This isn't the time
to give up.
A nice sentiment.

13:33.521 --> 13:36.858
[gasps]
Beetle! The other open cell!

13:36.858 --> 13:40.028
That's right.
And while you were distracted
with that electric loon,

13:40.028 --> 13:42.780
I managed to get
my confiscated gear,

13:42.780 --> 13:45.116
along with a few other toys.

13:45.116 --> 13:47.827
Say good‐bye to your friend,
Spider‐Man.

13:47.827 --> 13:48.828
[Spider‐Man]
No!

13:50.872 --> 13:53.916
Say good‐bye to your friend,
Spider‐Man.

13:53.916 --> 13:56.669
No!
[grunts]
[grunts]

13:56.669 --> 13:58.880
[both grunt]

13:58.880 --> 14:00.923
Spidey, you okay?

14:00.923 --> 14:05.136
Totally fine,
except that I hate candy corn.

14:05.136 --> 14:07.972
Who would make a gun
that shoots candy corn?

14:07.972 --> 14:11.184
Oh‐ho, so you haven't
met Jack O'Lantern.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.644
The police must've
confiscated his weapons.

14:13.644 --> 14:15.605
He's the worst.

14:15.605 --> 14:18.024
Everything's Halloween
with that doofus.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.567
[angry grunt]

14:19.567 --> 14:21.861
Never trust
someone else's gear.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.196
[yells]

14:23.196 --> 14:25.239
[grunting]

14:25.239 --> 14:27.825
Especially when my own
will do the job.

14:27.825 --> 14:29.035
Micro‐grenades!

14:29.035 --> 14:31.871
[grunts, yells]

14:31.871 --> 14:34.165
[grunts]

14:36.125 --> 14:38.127
[yells]
Get off!

14:38.127 --> 14:39.962
[Spider‐Man]
Chief!
[grunts, groans]

14:39.962 --> 14:40.963
Chief!

14:43.174 --> 14:44.926
[yells]
[groans]

14:45.968 --> 14:47.053
[groans]

14:47.053 --> 14:48.971
Don't worry, bug.

14:48.971 --> 14:52.433
After I'm done with you,
I'll finish her off too!

14:52.433 --> 14:55.019
[grunting]

14:56.854 --> 14:58.189
Aah!

15:01.317 --> 15:05.404
See? We don't need
that stupid door.
<i>Idiota!</i>

15:05.404 --> 15:09.408
Anya, you realize
that the door's
not after you personally?

15:09.408 --> 15:11.119
Says you.

15:11.119 --> 15:13.412
Almost in the air
ventilation operating system.

15:13.412 --> 15:15.540
Get ready with
the malware patch.

15:15.540 --> 15:18.084
[explosions]
Were those explosions?

15:18.084 --> 15:21.504
We have to hurry. Okay.
You've got an open slot.

15:21.504 --> 15:22.922
I see it.

15:22.922 --> 15:26.092
Intrusion file
in three, two, one‐‐

15:28.094 --> 15:30.930
Yes! Sciencing our way in!

15:30.930 --> 15:34.934
All right.
Thanks for your help, Anya.
Now I gotta get to work.

15:34.934 --> 15:38.062
[Anya]
You think I'm gonna let you
save Spidey by yourself?

15:38.062 --> 15:41.858
No offense, but this is
definitely gonna be a fight
that calls for spider powers.

15:41.858 --> 15:45.153
Yeah. I know.
So good news.

15:45.153 --> 15:48.406
You get to team up
with Spider‐Girl!

15:50.074 --> 15:52.034
Uh, s‐‐

15:52.034 --> 15:53.828
So, you, uh‐‐

15:53.828 --> 15:56.372
Uh, I didn't, uh‐‐

15:56.372 --> 15:58.875
[explosion]
Whoa! W‐Wait up!

15:58.875 --> 16:01.794
[grunting]

16:03.254 --> 16:04.672
Whoa!

16:04.672 --> 16:07.091
[both grunting]

16:07.091 --> 16:10.720
Come on, Beetle.
Stop being such a pest!

16:12.013 --> 16:14.223
[both grunting]

16:14.223 --> 16:15.516
[yells]

16:15.516 --> 16:17.852
[groans]

16:17.852 --> 16:20.855
You're really off your game,
Spider.

16:20.855 --> 16:24.108
I was hoping for a bit more
of a fair fight.

16:24.108 --> 16:25.151
Huh?

16:25.151 --> 16:26.777
Surprise!

16:26.777 --> 16:30.198
What is this, a bug party?

16:30.198 --> 16:32.783
[yells]

16:41.250 --> 16:44.712
Oh, man.
Another spider?
[both grunting]

16:44.712 --> 16:47.757
I must be so out of it,
I've got double‐spider vision.

16:47.757 --> 16:49.926
[Miles]
No. Spider‐Girl's really here.

16:49.926 --> 16:53.054
[cries out, groans]

16:53.054 --> 16:56.307
And she's legit!
[yells]

16:56.307 --> 16:59.143
[yells]

16:59.143 --> 17:00.895
[groans]
Miles heard Ock earlier.

17:00.895 --> 17:03.022
We know the clock's ticking,
Spidey.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.233
We'll handle this guy.
Go stop Ock!

17:05.233 --> 17:08.152
Thanks... Spider‐Girl.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.788
[computers beeping]

17:18.788 --> 17:21.457
The Living Brain! The bomb!
[panting]

17:21.457 --> 17:24.168
Gotta defuse it. Ugh!
But where could it be?

17:24.168 --> 17:25.836
[panting]
[beeping]

17:25.836 --> 17:27.421
Gotta find it!
[beeping continues]

17:27.421 --> 17:29.465
Huh? What's that?

17:34.679 --> 17:38.391
Spider‐Man!
So predictable.

17:39.433 --> 17:41.185
Ock?
[grunts, groans]

17:41.185 --> 17:43.187
This bomb
has to be deactivated.

17:43.187 --> 17:46.232
If it goes off,
everyone in the building
will be destroyed,

17:46.232 --> 17:49.652
including you in that tin box
you're scooting around in!

17:49.652 --> 17:53.114
Do not concern yourself
with such a triviality.
[grunting]

17:53.114 --> 17:55.241
As soon as
I've defeated you,

17:55.241 --> 17:59.704
I'll take care
of the bomb myself,
as per my plan.

18:00.871 --> 18:02.999
[grunts]

18:05.126 --> 18:08.504
I hope your new appliance
came with a warranty.

18:08.504 --> 18:11.048
This mere metal frame
was never meant

18:11.048 --> 18:15.177
to be a long‐term vehicle
for my precious mind.

18:15.177 --> 18:18.598
No. I've had my eye
on a much better model.

18:18.598 --> 18:21.142
[grunts, groans]

18:21.142 --> 18:25.271
[groaning]
Fighting you put my
original body into a coma.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.733
Aah!
You owe me a new one.

18:28.733 --> 18:32.945
[Spider‐Man groaning weakly]
Something spider‐powered,
perhaps?

18:32.945 --> 18:36.657
Wait. What are you‐‐
What are you saying?

18:38.367 --> 18:40.202
<i>[Living Brain laughing]</i>

18:40.202 --> 18:43.873

<i>I never believed</i>
<i>any of those newbie villains</i>
<i>would take you down.</i>

18:51.380 --> 18:54.634
I just needed
your defenses worn out,

18:54.634 --> 18:58.512
[Spider‐Man straining]
making you susceptible
to the download

18:58.512 --> 19:04.226

19:12.860 --> 19:14.945
Sorry, Ock...

19:14.945 --> 19:19.367

but this body
is already occupied!

19:26.707 --> 19:28.084

19:28.084 --> 19:30.544
You don't play well
with others.

19:30.544 --> 19:33.464
I'm taking away your toys.

19:33.464 --> 19:35.675
You'll pay for‐‐

19:35.675 --> 19:37.343
You are in time‐out.

19:39.178 --> 19:42.139
Wow, Spider‐Girl.
I'm impressed.

19:42.139 --> 19:44.141
You're a natural.
[chuckles]

19:44.141 --> 19:47.269
Well, you and Spidey
haven't set bad examples.

19:47.269 --> 19:50.398
Hey! The facility's
computer nerve center!

19:50.398 --> 19:53.693
Let's see if we can cancel
the lockdown from in here.

19:57.321 --> 19:59.323
Huh?

19:59.323 --> 20:01.367
[both]
Huh?

20:12.002 --> 20:13.546
Don't have
much time left.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.464
We gotta get back in
and help Spidey.

Way to go, man!
[horn blares]

20:33.190 --> 20:35.776
[cheering continues]
You did it, Spider‐Man.

20:35.776 --> 20:38.404
They don't think
he's a menace today.

20:38.404 --> 20:41.741
Maybe people
will finally see Spidey
for who he really is.

has won the day!

20:59.175 --> 21:02.094
Spider‐Man is no more.
