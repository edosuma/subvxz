00:33.475 --> 00:34.676
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

00:34.709 --> 00:36.078
<i>Just another rom-com.</i>

00:36.112 --> 00:38.513
<i>Well, you'd definitely be wrong
about that.</i>

00:38.915 --> 00:39.849
<i>Where do I start?</i>

00:40.950 --> 00:43.786
<i>Man, I had the swag,
the look, the everything.</i>

00:43.820 --> 00:45.420
<i>I don't even know what it was.</i>

00:45.453 --> 00:46.421
<i>Kind of just had it.</i>

00:46.454 --> 00:48.891
<i>You know, as I'm older,
I know what it is.</i>

00:48.925 --> 00:54.130
<i>It's that thing called je ne... je ne...
je ne sais quoi. Yeah, that's it.</i>

00:54.163 --> 00:55.697
<i>I don't even know
what I'm talking.</i>

00:55.730 --> 00:57.632
<i>Let me take you back to the 90s.</i>

00:58.901 --> 01:00.569
- What are you up to, man?
- Good.

01:00.602 --> 01:02.404
I haven't seen you in ages,
but it always was like that.

01:02.437 --> 01:04.140
- Innit?
- What have you been up to?

01:04.173 --> 01:07.742
Bunked college, bunked sports, bunked football,
gave it away. Gave it up all for women.

01:08.643 --> 01:10.146
- That sounds blasé.
- Yeah.

01:10.179 --> 01:12.714
You don't care about your books
no more, your stuff?

01:12.747 --> 01:13.850
What about...
what about sports like?

01:13.883 --> 01:16.685
- Hey. Yo, you know the Cool J?
- Yeah.

01:16.718 --> 01:18.653
- You know that lip movement he does?
- Mm-hmm.

01:18.687 --> 01:19.621
He got that from me.

01:19.654 --> 01:22.124
Wait, what...
what are you talking about?

01:23.960 --> 01:25.127
You're stupid, man.

01:25.161 --> 01:26.295
You're silly, bruv.

01:26.329 --> 01:27.864
- I don't know what's gotten into you.
- Listen, man.

01:27.897 --> 01:29.764
When I grow up,
I'm gonna be like Jay Z.

01:30.498 --> 01:31.466
- Really?
- Puff Daddy.

01:31.499 --> 01:32.601
Really?

01:32.634 --> 01:35.470
Nah, I get more girls than Puffy.
See these looks.

01:35.770 --> 01:36.839
See these...
see these looks, man.

01:37.639 --> 01:38.740
What?

01:42.979 --> 01:44.613
Oh, shit!

01:53.688 --> 01:55.690
Bro, are you seeing this?

02:02.999 --> 02:05.500
<i>As I got older,
it got easier.</i>

02:05.533 --> 02:08.503
<i>I was getting girls
twice my age, twice my size.</i>

02:08.536 --> 02:09.738
<i>I'm not just saying it.</i>

02:09.771 --> 02:11.539
<i>But I was the man.</i>

02:13.475 --> 02:14.509
Hey, hey, hey.

02:14.542 --> 02:15.878
Baby.

02:15.912 --> 02:16.779
Can I get your digits?

02:16.812 --> 02:18.680
How'd you know I have a phone?

02:19.547 --> 02:20.682
How old are you anyways?

02:20.715 --> 02:21.784
Mm-hmm.

02:21.817 --> 02:24.220
Someone with that buff,
def connected.

02:24.253 --> 02:26.188
And I'm whatever age
you want me to be, innit?

02:27.790 --> 02:31.526
Have you got a... And a...

02:39.701 --> 02:41.770
- You're cute.
- Thanks.

02:45.573 --> 02:46.976
- Just like that, yeah?
- Yeah.

02:51.948 --> 02:53.783
Whoa! Shit.

02:53.816 --> 02:55.684
Um, I just wanted
to ask if you, um,

02:55.717 --> 02:57.619
if you wanted to like to go,
um...

02:57.652 --> 03:00.256
She wanted to ask if you'd
go out on a date with her.

03:00.289 --> 03:01.857
Yeah. That's...

03:09.065 --> 03:11.533
What? Me? With her?

03:12.068 --> 03:13.069
Are you mad?

03:13.803 --> 03:14.536
No one will go out with her.

03:14.569 --> 03:15.470
Bro, allow-it, man.
Allow-it.

03:15.503 --> 03:18.007
Look at her face.
How many spots is that?

03:18.040 --> 03:20.276
One, two... Oh, man.

03:20.309 --> 03:23.678
Look... look at her teeth.
Smile for a bit. Smile.

03:23.712 --> 03:25.714
Do you eat bricks with them?

03:25.747 --> 03:26.849
Bro, you can't do this, man.

03:26.882 --> 03:28.616
Don't you have coco-butter
in your yard?

03:28.650 --> 03:30.853
- I shouldn't... I shouldn't have asked.
- No, you shouldn't have.

03:32.520 --> 03:37.059
Look. Okay. Okay. Okay, alright. Alright,
alright, alright. I'm sorry. I'm joking.

03:37.093 --> 03:39.561
Alright. I'm joking. Hold on.

03:47.803 --> 03:49.571
Here, bell me.

03:51.606 --> 03:54.110
What did you do?

03:55.911 --> 03:57.046
You're just so cruel.

03:59.315 --> 04:01.549
<i>And that's when
it started to go bad.</i>

04:01.583 --> 04:02.717
<i>I mean, really bad.</i>

04:02.751 --> 04:06.856
<i>Every girl I ever met;
problems, drama, arguments.</i>

04:06.889 --> 04:09.859
<i>I was 19 then.
I'm almost 40 now.</i>

04:10.592 --> 04:11.127
<i>And guess what?</i>

04:11.927 --> 04:13.062
And I'm still single.

04:13.095 --> 04:14.897
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:14.930 --> 04:17.565
What you're saying is,
you've not got a steady girlfriend.

04:17.599 --> 04:19.634
I mean, it's not like
you're not getting any.

04:19.667 --> 04:23.705
- Nah, I'm serious.
- I just don't get it, darling. You are beautiful.

04:23.738 --> 04:25.875
You're a catch, honestly.
I can't believe it.

04:25.908 --> 04:27.910
You're joking, right?

04:27.943 --> 04:29.912
No. I wish if I was.
I don't get it myself.

04:29.945 --> 04:32.114
I've got a good property
business.

04:32.148 --> 04:34.984
I've got money in the bank,
you know, I got my own teeth.

04:35.017 --> 04:37.719
Yeah. I wear nice clothes.
I'm doing alright.

04:37.752 --> 04:39.121
Alright.
My hair is a little bit light.

04:39.155 --> 04:41.756
What hair, bro? What hair?

04:41.791 --> 04:43.359
I was going to say
it's a little bit thin.

04:43.392 --> 04:45.895
Thin? Thin?

04:45.928 --> 04:48.763
- Bruv, your hair is gone. It's gone, bro.
- It's alright.

04:48.798 --> 04:51.333
It's cool though, man.
Women like guys with no hair, man.

04:51.367 --> 04:53.002
- They like guys that are bald.
- Say that twice.

04:53.035 --> 04:55.337
Guys with no hair
always say that line.

04:55.371 --> 04:56.571
Alright. Fair enough.
Fair enough.

04:56.604 --> 04:59.707
But you know what, like, Jason,
like, you're doing alright.

04:59.741 --> 05:01.777
Like, you've got two kids.
You're married.

05:01.811 --> 05:03.145
- Well... You're alright.
- Yeah.

05:03.179 --> 05:05.815
Cruz, to be honest,
you're still the same.

05:05.848 --> 05:07.883
You're still the same. He ain't changed.

05:07.917 --> 05:09.385
Nothing's developed for him,
like...

05:09.418 --> 05:10.820
He's still got,
like, hundred girls.

05:10.853 --> 05:12.687
Like, God knows how many kids.

05:12.720 --> 05:15.091
So right. Always has been.

05:15.124 --> 05:17.625
Yeah. But you're... but you still have...
But you're happy, right?

05:17.659 --> 05:20.162
- Yeah.
- Alright, fair enough.

05:20.196 --> 05:22.398
Like J, like,
you're getting engaged.

05:22.431 --> 05:23.933
- Yes.
- Congratulations!

05:23.966 --> 05:26.701
- Well done, son. And I'm proud of you.
- Yeah.

05:26.734 --> 05:28.871
Like, Brian,
even Brian's got a girl.

05:28.904 --> 05:29.905
- Yeah, thank you.
- Yeah.

05:29.939 --> 05:30.973
- Yeah.
- Even though she is a man.

05:32.441 --> 05:34.977
What's that supposed to mean,
you cheap little bugger?

05:35.010 --> 05:37.813
What about that girl you met the other day?
You said that was okay, right?

05:37.847 --> 05:38.746
Yeah.

You know, I had to wait for the weed man

06:42.211 --> 06:43.913
to pop along in them
things there, you know.

06:45.080 --> 06:46.182
Are you Charmaine?

06:46.215 --> 06:47.783
Yeah, man.

06:49.218 --> 06:50.685
Man's balling.

06:51.887 --> 06:54.290
So what,
I'm licking a baller now, yeah?

06:55.090 --> 06:56.458
Is that you, brother?

06:56.492 --> 07:01.130
Mm-hmm. 20 in... inch rims
the thing's shiny, bruv.

07:03.499 --> 07:04.699
Come, man.

07:05.968 --> 07:08.938
Mmm. Is this me?

07:08.971 --> 07:11.140
- This is me.
- Um...

07:11.173 --> 07:12.740
Who you calling?

07:15.010 --> 07:16.078
Who are you calling?

07:17.246 --> 07:19.081
Yo, who you calling?

07:20.249 --> 07:24.286
Na, na, na, na, na, na. I asked you
a question, brother. Who you calling?

07:25.087 --> 07:26.822
Who are you calling?

07:26.855 --> 07:28.723
<i>I even tried speed dating.</i>

07:29.058 --> 07:30.993
<i>This is how that turned out.</i>

07:31.026 --> 07:34.129
Yeah, so, um, this is the
first time I've done this.

07:34.163 --> 07:36.498
I'm quite nervous.
Um, how... how does it work?

07:36.532 --> 07:37.933
- Well, you tell us a bit about yourself...
- Yeah.

07:37.967 --> 07:39.802
...and we decide
if you're boring

07:39.835 --> 07:41.904
or if you're not our type, then,
press the bell and you leave.

07:41.937 --> 07:46.909
Okay, alright. Um, okay, so my name's
Treyvon and I'm a property developer.

07:48.110 --> 07:49.812
I'm not really
into materialistic.

07:49.845 --> 07:51.113
I prefer sensitive.

07:51.146 --> 07:56.518
Hi, I'm Treyvon and I'm a Sagittarius and I'm sensitive.

07:56.552 --> 08:00.322
I only like assertive rich guys,
men who take charge.

08:01.056 --> 08:04.159
Successful and assertive.

08:04.893 --> 08:07.296
And I'm a feminist and no guy can tell me what to do.

08:07.329 --> 08:12.835
I'm assertive, I'm rich but I'm not
materialistic and I like feminists.

08:12.868 --> 08:15.004
Piss off you liar.

08:15.037 --> 08:17.172
UH, I don't like mess
and I'm quite organized.

08:17.606 --> 08:21.176
Too bad. I like crazy, spontaneous guys.

08:21.210 --> 08:22.978
Yeah, I'm the sporty type.

08:23.012 --> 08:25.281
I like the countryside
and the great outdoors.

08:25.314 --> 08:27.082
Oh, I hate nature.

08:27.116 --> 08:29.018
All the bugs and spiders
crawling about.

08:35.190 --> 08:37.259
<i>Even my mate Mark tried
to hook me up with his friend.</i>

08:37.293 --> 08:38.827
<i>Apparently,
she saw me at the gym,</i>

08:38.861 --> 08:40.562
<i>thought I looked nice,
sent me a pic.</i>

08:40.596 --> 08:42.131
<i>I thought,
yeah, she looked nice.</i>

08:42.164 --> 08:44.600
<i>Spoke a few times,
arranged a date,</i>

08:44.633 --> 08:46.568
<i>but I didn't expect this.</i>

08:52.074 --> 08:54.343
- Just say hi. Just say hi.
- Hello.

08:54.376 --> 08:56.345
Come in. Come in.
Everybody in. Everybody in.

08:56.378 --> 09:01.050
Hi. Kids, come inside.
Come on. Come on. In you go.

09:01.083 --> 09:02.384
- Hi. I'm Cindy.
- Hello.

09:02.418 --> 09:03.452
- Treyvon?
- I'm Treyvon. Yes.

09:03.485 --> 09:05.587
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Listen, I'm so, so sorry.

09:05.621 --> 09:06.922
All the dads are running really,
really late.

09:06.955 --> 09:08.357
Alexander's dad got canceled.

09:08.390 --> 09:11.193
Eh, girl, do not do a poo
in the kitchen.

09:11.226 --> 09:13.162
Go into the garden. Now.

09:13.195 --> 09:14.263
Good girl.

09:14.296 --> 09:15.964
Twins. Sorry.

09:15.998 --> 09:17.866
Listen, my mom's coming down
to babysit.

09:17.900 --> 09:19.268
So do you want to come in
for a quick tea first?

09:19.301 --> 09:21.904
Yeah, I've just got to move my car
because of the traffic wardens.

09:21.937 --> 09:23.272
- I'll be back in a second.
- Okay.

09:23.305 --> 09:24.373
- No problem. How do you take your tea?
- Yeah.

09:24.406 --> 09:26.342
- Uh, two sugars please.
- Milk?

09:26.375 --> 09:28.410
- Uh, just a little bit.
- A little bit milk, two sugars.

09:28.444 --> 09:29.912
- Thank you.
- Okay. I'll... I'll go put the kettle on.

09:29.945 --> 09:30.814
Yeah, okay.

09:30.846 --> 09:32.381
- Okay. Coming up.
- Alright. Thank you.

09:32.414 --> 09:34.149
Alright.

09:34.183 --> 09:35.951
- Oh, two sugars?
- Yeah.

09:35.984 --> 09:37.252
- Okay, coming up.
- Alright.

09:55.671 --> 09:57.139
Jesus Christ.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.008
That is hilarious.

10:00.676 --> 10:03.412
Oh, no, but listen,
there was this one girl, right?

10:03.445 --> 10:05.414
- Yeah.
- Well, come on then, go on.

10:05.447 --> 10:06.348
So I was out jogging...

10:07.149 --> 10:08.150
<i>And then there she was.</i>

10:08.183 --> 10:12.287
<i>I mean, absolutely stunning,
10 out of 10.</i>

10:17.459 --> 10:19.461
Yeah, no, I'm... no, I'm okay.

10:19.495 --> 10:21.430
Um, yeah,
I just needed to come back.

10:21.463 --> 10:22.664
That's why I dropped.

10:22.698 --> 10:24.066
Right, that's original.

10:24.099 --> 10:26.301
- Hold on. Wait, do you jog around here a lot?
- All the time, yeah.

10:26.335 --> 10:30.305
- I've never seen you.
- Yeah, just in and out, I mean.

10:30.339 --> 10:33.142
Hold on, wait. Hold on. Wait, wait.
Um, what... Do you live in the area?

10:33.175 --> 10:34.109
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:34.143 --> 10:36.311
Listen, I...
I jog around here all the time

10:36.345 --> 10:38.414
and I need a jogging partner,
maybe.

10:38.447 --> 10:40.682
Is there any way that I'd be
able to like contact you again

10:40.716 --> 10:43.419
because, you know,
maybe jog together or, like...

10:43.452 --> 10:44.888
um, I know it's a bit forward.

10:44.920 --> 10:47.356
Hold on, wait, wait, I know it's a
bit forward and you don't know me,

10:47.389 --> 10:48.690
but is it possible
to grab your number

10:48.724 --> 10:51.960
and maybe we can go running
or something?

10:51.994 --> 10:53.028
- I don't know.
- Sure, sure, sure.

10:53.061 --> 10:55.297
- What is it?
- 07957...

10:55.330 --> 10:57.966
- Okay, 07957...
- ...285...

10:58.000 --> 10:59.968
- 285...
- ...402. Yeah.

11:00.002 --> 11:01.103
- What?
- ...402.

11:01.437 --> 11:03.138
- ...285...
- ...402.

11:04.173 --> 11:05.240
Bye.

11:06.041 --> 11:07.509
Oh.

11:08.143 --> 11:09.978
Oh, my God!

11:10.012 --> 11:11.213
Alright. Oh...

11:14.516 --> 11:15.517
Oh, my...

11:20.289 --> 11:21.190
Tch.

11:22.758 --> 11:25.227
Trust me, bruv. I was pissed.

11:25.260 --> 11:28.497
Look, perhaps she can help.

11:28.530 --> 11:30.999
Honestly, she's really,
really good.

11:31.033 --> 11:32.234
She'll tell you
all kinds of stuff,

11:32.267 --> 11:35.137
things from your past and even
stuff that's in the future.

11:35.471 --> 11:36.371
Look.

11:37.306 --> 11:38.474
Madame Ruby.

11:39.141 --> 11:40.476
Bruv, that's mad.

11:40.509 --> 11:41.543
You know what makes it worse?

11:41.577 --> 11:43.512
I've got to listen
to flipping Ashley every night.

11:43.545 --> 11:45.747
- Who?
- Ashley. You'll meet him later.

11:45.782 --> 11:47.216
He's a friend of mine
staying at my flat.

11:47.583 --> 11:48.952
Have you ever thought
about counseling?

11:48.984 --> 11:52.187
I know a real good couple of
people that I can recommend you to.

11:52.221 --> 11:55.324
Now, we're black. If we need
counseling, we go barbershop, innit?

11:55.357 --> 11:58.393
We've been best friends since we've been at university.

11:58.427 --> 12:00.329
Well, not you obviously.

12:00.362 --> 12:03.098
Yeah, we don't get to see
each other all of the time,

12:03.131 --> 12:07.202
but we are going to get him
a girl before your wedding.

12:07.236 --> 12:08.470
Or die trying.

12:08.504 --> 12:11.240
Alright, alright. To J and his fiancée, man.

12:11.273 --> 12:12.809
- Come on, man.
- Yes, to J and his fiancée.

12:12.842 --> 12:14.209
- Come on, bruv.
- Cheers.

12:14.243 --> 12:16.378
And, hopefully, we can get Trey some
pom-pom before the decade's out.

12:30.592 --> 12:31.593
Really?

12:37.499 --> 12:38.500
Aargh!

12:39.401 --> 12:40.302
Stop.

12:41.103 --> 12:42.371
Oh, yes!

12:54.583 --> 12:56.618
- What?
- Oh.

12:56.652 --> 12:58.420
- Hi, Reesh. Hello.
- Hi, Treyvon.

12:58.453 --> 13:03.158
You're... um, yeah, is... is
Ash... Yeah, of course, he is.

13:03.191 --> 13:04.393
- Um, can I speak with him?
- Yeah, he's here.

13:04.426 --> 13:05.661
Okay, thank you, alright.

13:07.362 --> 13:08.430
Bruv.

13:08.463 --> 13:10.165
Bruv, thought you was out, man?

13:10.198 --> 13:12.167
Yeah, yeah,
well, I could hear you were in.

13:12.200 --> 13:13.937
Sorry, man.

13:13.970 --> 13:16.338
Nah, bruv, I'm serious, man. I need to get
some sleep, man. Can you keep the noise down?

13:16.371 --> 13:17.306
Alright.

13:17.339 --> 13:18.206
Thank you.

14:00.649 --> 14:02.919
I mean, what women see in these things anyway?

14:02.952 --> 14:07.289
- Just go harder, go harder.
- Ah, God. It's just too tight.

14:08.925 --> 14:10.559
Wait. Change position.

14:10.592 --> 14:12.361
Nah, I'm gonna break it.

14:12.394 --> 14:14.529
- You can do it.
- Let me try cloth hanger.

14:15.430 --> 14:17.666
- Ah!
- Ah! Go on.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.601
I don't want it to tear.

14:20.937 --> 14:23.405
That's it. That's it.

14:27.442 --> 14:29.946
- Go on. Get in.
- That's it.

14:35.550 --> 14:38.387
- Thank God. That is over.
- Wow.

14:38.420 --> 14:40.689
Yo Trey, what are you saying, brother?
You good?

14:40.722 --> 14:42.190
Yo, J, what's good?

14:42.557 --> 14:44.159
No, I'm just out training, man.

14:45.460 --> 14:47.362
Yeah, last night was good still, man.
Great to see the guys.

14:47.396 --> 14:49.598
Yeah, man. We shouldn't leave
it so long next time, man.

14:49.631 --> 14:51.667
Listen, I was thinking, alright.

14:51.700 --> 14:55.270
My cousin, she's a relationship
therapist, right and perhaps you...

14:55.303 --> 14:56.304
Hello?

14:56.338 --> 14:57.239
Trey?

14:57.706 --> 14:59.241
Trey? Hello.

14:59.708 --> 15:00.642
Dang.

15:06.682 --> 15:08.383
Yes, bruv, what's up?

15:08.417 --> 15:09.786
Yeah, I was just thinking, Trey.

15:10.519 --> 15:12.654
Bruv, I'm not going
to a therapist.

15:13.388 --> 15:15.490
It's just an idea, bruv.
I was thinking that maybe you could...

15:15.524 --> 15:17.659
Bruv, I'm good. I'm not going.

15:21.263 --> 15:24.700
So how long have you not had
a serious girlfriend?

15:24.733 --> 15:29.304
Oh, um, I don't know, uh...

15:29.337 --> 15:32.207
Has it been that long
that you can't remember?

15:32.674 --> 15:39.681
No, it's... no, no it's... Eh...

15:40.549 --> 15:44.987
I think about 15 years.

15:45.021 --> 15:46.755
Fifteen y...

15:46.789 --> 15:47.990
About that.

15:48.024 --> 15:49.391
Are you ill?

15:49.424 --> 15:51.593
No, no, I'm fine. I'm fine.

15:51.626 --> 15:53.595
I think. I think.

15:53.628 --> 15:55.697
Oh, you've been to prison?

15:55.731 --> 15:59.735
No, no, no. No, never been
in trouble before ever.

15:59.768 --> 16:02.738
Looks like there's a lot
that you've not been in,

16:02.771 --> 16:06.441
but, look,
what about sexual encounters?

16:06.475 --> 16:12.347
Yeah, of course, of course,
yeah, like a few.

16:12.714 --> 16:16.351
Just my problem is girlfriends,
long-term relationship.

16:16.384 --> 16:18.587
Nothing seems to last
more than six months.

16:18.620 --> 16:19.755
I don't know... I don't know
what I'm doing wrong.

16:19.789 --> 16:22.657
- Six... months?
- Yeah.

16:23.759 --> 16:26.561
Is everything okay down there?

16:28.396 --> 16:30.800
Everything's fine, thank you.

16:30.833 --> 16:35.704
Okay, look, look, I think
you should try online dating.

16:35.737 --> 16:36.738
Yeah.

16:36.772 --> 16:39.574
No. No, no, that's not for me.

16:39.608 --> 16:44.346
Yes, yes. Look, there's loads of women
on there that's just desperate...

16:44.379 --> 16:47.315
desperately seeking love,
you know,

16:47.349 --> 16:50.820
and you can cross check
and look at the suitability.

16:50.853 --> 16:52.822
I... I think that's the way
forward for you.

16:52.855 --> 16:54.623
You can't go wrong.

16:54.656 --> 16:55.557
Mm.

16:57.093 --> 16:58.460
That might work still.

16:58.861 --> 17:01.097
- Okay.
- Yeah, great.

17:01.130 --> 17:03.565
Alright. No, you know what, I might...
I might give it a try.

17:03.598 --> 17:07.636
Just in... in case it...
it doesn't work, you know,

17:07.669 --> 17:11.706
I have a little service myself,
you know, after nine...

17:11.740 --> 17:14.576
9:00 PM one to one.

17:15.744 --> 17:17.814
Just 079 me.

17:19.481 --> 17:20.549
- You just...
- Okay.

17:20.582 --> 17:24.352
- 079 me.
- Okay. Okay.

17:24.386 --> 17:25.587
Thank you.

17:25.620 --> 17:26.721
Mm-Hm.

17:27.589 --> 17:28.623
Mm-Hm.

17:29.391 --> 17:30.559
Mm-Hm.

17:32.161 --> 17:35.865
<i>I ain't gonna lie.
That shit pissed me off.</i>

17:35.898 --> 17:40.735
<i>When you're single, everyone around is all
hugging, loving, kissing up each other.</i>

17:41.503 --> 17:42.905
<i>It's not even February yet.</i>

17:42.939 --> 17:46.809
<i>Look at these two, for example,
tongues down each other's throat.</i>

17:46.843 --> 17:48.911
<i>It's like he's trying to taste
her liver or something.</i>

17:50.880 --> 17:52.480
<i>Anyway, then there's me.</i>

17:53.883 --> 17:55.550
Hey, give us a tenner.

17:55.584 --> 17:56.751
Yeah, yeah, mate.

17:56.786 --> 17:58.587
What? Did you just ask for a...

17:58.620 --> 17:59.588
- Tenner.
- Yeah, tenner.

17:59.621 --> 18:01.123
- Give us a tenner.
- Are you mad?

18:01.157 --> 18:03.758
People nowadays,
they've never got any change, man.

18:03.793 --> 18:05.127
Yeah, they got no change.

18:05.161 --> 18:06.761
They've always got
a sneaky little tenner.

18:07.562 --> 18:09.431
What... to do what?

18:09.464 --> 18:10.900
Are you stu... Is he stupid?

18:10.933 --> 18:12.134
Oh, I tell you
what we want to do.

18:12.168 --> 18:14.703
We want two tickets for the
opera, we want to go for din...

18:14.736 --> 18:16.738
Look, mate,
can't you see we're homeless.

18:16.771 --> 18:19.474
See this? This has to last
all three of us.

18:19.507 --> 18:21.143
Three?

18:21.177 --> 18:22.677
Give them some money.

18:22.711 --> 18:25.882
My wife.

18:25.915 --> 18:26.883
I've got some change, yeah.

18:26.916 --> 18:27.884
Here you go. Some change.

18:27.917 --> 18:30.853
He gave.

18:58.814 --> 18:59.681
Good morning, Trey.

19:00.816 --> 19:01.716
Trey!

19:02.818 --> 19:06.188
Come on, bruv. Look... really?

19:06.222 --> 19:07.790
Bruv, go and put
some clothes on, man.

19:07.823 --> 19:10.793
- What are you doing here anyway?
- This is my house, yeah?

19:10.826 --> 19:12.194
That's the first thing.

19:12.228 --> 19:15.197
Secondly, that project I'm working
on, I want to do it from home.

19:15.231 --> 19:16.832
- Is that alright?
- I hear that.

19:17.766 --> 19:18.667
You smelling it?

19:21.503 --> 19:22.671
Bruv, come on.

19:22.704 --> 19:25.241
Listen, I know we're good
friends here but this is weird.

19:25.274 --> 19:26.042
Come on, man.

19:29.779 --> 19:31.513
Me and Reesh,
we were talking earlier.

19:31.546 --> 19:33.983
Oh, so you guys find time
to talk to, yeah?

19:35.785 --> 19:36.685
Funny.

19:36.718 --> 19:37.954
And yeah, sometimes.

19:37.987 --> 19:39.922
When are you going to get
a woman, mate?

19:39.956 --> 19:41.656
Like, settle down?

19:41.690 --> 19:44.459
I'm up in here almost, what,
two years and...

19:47.930 --> 19:48.730
Are you...

19:48.763 --> 19:51.566
Na... Very funny.
No, I'm not gay.

19:51.599 --> 19:53.635
It's... look,
it's cool if you are, like...

19:53.668 --> 19:56.038
Bruv, I said I'm not gay,
alright?

19:56.072 --> 19:58.707
I just... just haven't found
the right one, that's it.

19:58.740 --> 20:02.011
What in two... Ah, nothing.

20:02.044 --> 20:05.915
You need to... you need to go on
like Tinder or Plenty of Fish.

20:05.948 --> 20:07.049
There's loads of women on there,
bruv.

20:07.883 --> 20:09.484
That's where I met Reesh.

20:09.885 --> 20:10.820
Not for me.

20:15.091 --> 20:16.025
Really?

20:20.896 --> 20:23.631
Yeah, look, this isn't a joke,
this is a big deal.

20:23.665 --> 20:25.034
Six-figure deal this is.

20:26.035 --> 20:27.803
Yeah. Okay.

20:29.005 --> 20:32.540
Yeah, but I need the report on my
desk within seven days, please.

20:33.641 --> 20:34.542
Yeah.

20:35.911 --> 20:36.578
Yeah, but you're the one who's
told me to meet the surveyor here

20:36.611 --> 20:37.947
for six o'clock in the evening.

20:37.980 --> 20:42.051
I'm here at six o'clock. And that's it.
So where's the surveyor?

20:42.084 --> 20:43.185
Hi.

20:43.219 --> 20:45.087
Oh, thank you.
Hold on one sec, I think she's here.

20:45.121 --> 20:46.588
Okay, thanks. Bye.

20:46.621 --> 20:47.655
Mr. Patterson?

20:47.689 --> 20:48.891
- Wow!
- Hi.

20:48.924 --> 20:50.826
Um, yeah. Hi. Hello.

20:50.860 --> 20:53.595
- I'm Ms. Francis from Eaton and Co Surveyors.
- Hello.

20:53.628 --> 20:56.298
- Okay, so I've taken a look at the property.
- Yeah.

20:56.332 --> 20:58.767
And, structurally,
there's some damages to the rear.

20:58.801 --> 21:02.038
- Ah...
- And nothing that can't be treated and resolved.

21:02.771 --> 21:03.973
Yeah.

21:04.006 --> 21:06.976
Yeah, um, how long do you think
it would take to get resolved?

21:07.009 --> 21:09.644
- Give or take two weeks.
- Okay.

21:09.677 --> 21:12.314
So, I'll get a report sent out
to you as soon as possible

21:12.348 --> 21:16.018
- so we can get things sorted quite quickly.
- Okay.

21:16.052 --> 21:18.054
Um, what are you actually going
to be doing with the property?

21:18.788 --> 21:20.622
Yeah, um, luxury flats.

21:20.655 --> 21:22.690
- Oh, nice.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:22.724 --> 21:25.560
Excellent. Um, well,
I think that's all from me.

21:25.961 --> 21:27.396
Was there any questions?

21:27.430 --> 21:29.932
Yeah, well, like, what are you doing later?
Like maybe we could...

21:32.168 --> 21:33.135
What?

21:44.246 --> 21:47.917
<i>So on tonight's show, we're
gonna be talking about relationships,</i>

21:47.950 --> 21:49.952
<i>the good, the bad and the ugly.</i>

21:49.985 --> 21:54.123
<i>Have you ever been hurt? What's your
ideal partner? And much, much more.</i>

21:55.057 --> 21:57.725
<i>Some men
just can't get a girlfriend.</i>

21:57.759 --> 22:00.662
<i>I don't know, they just don't
have the swag or the confidence.</i>

22:01.729 --> 22:03.665
<i>If any of you
would like to dial in</i>

22:03.698 --> 22:05.134
<i>and talk about your experiences,
feel free.</i>

22:21.784 --> 22:26.989
Hi, this is DJ Sass and you're

22:27.022 --> 22:29.959

22:29.992 --> 22:33.129
Yeah, this is Treyvon...

22:42.204 --> 22:44.739
...15 years. Just over...

22:44.772 --> 22:46.075
- Wait, did he just say...
- Wow.

22:46.108 --> 22:47.343
What?

22:47.376 --> 22:48.577
- <i>That long?</i>
- He's technically a virgin again.

22:48.611 --> 22:52.114
He's technically a virgin again.
Everything's sealed back up.

22:53.382 --> 22:56.152
I bet right now, if he releases,
he'll be two stones lighter.

22:56.185 --> 22:57.820
His... his complexion
will even change.

22:57.853 --> 23:00.990
<i>Any woman stand next to him... just stand
next to him, and she'd get pregnant.</i>

23:01.023 --> 23:02.858
<i>Don't know the price
of condoms.</i>

23:03.459 --> 23:08.197
I just didn't think
men went that long without sex.

23:08.230 --> 23:12.168
I know... I know there's this thing called
blue balls but he's got the rainbow.

23:12.201 --> 23:14.904
- Yeah, buddy.
- He'll be all kind of colors.

23:14.937 --> 23:16.105
- He's got Skittles balls.
- He's got Skittles balls.

23:31.220 --> 23:33.088
Woo-hoo!

23:33.122 --> 23:35.757
Trey baby, you awake, bruv?

23:35.791 --> 23:37.126
Yeah? Look who I brought in.

23:49.838 --> 23:55.277

- Ooh! I do like a man with no hair.

23:56.245 --> 23:58.314
Let me take a close look.

23:59.515 --> 24:02.218
Oh, very nice.

24:04.954 --> 24:08.824
Don't mind me if I just touch you here?

24:08.857 --> 24:10.226
And there.

24:11.026 --> 24:12.494
And there.

24:12.528 --> 24:14.997
Oh, look at you.

24:19.335 --> 24:20.936
Oh...

24:28.010 --> 24:29.245
Oh, man.

24:38.087 --> 24:40.289
Hey. Wake up, you dirty boy!

24:41.023 --> 24:43.959
What are you making
all them sexy noises for?

24:43.993 --> 24:50.165
With the ooh,
and the aah and the oh-oh-oh.

24:50.199 --> 24:51.867
Oh, my Lord!

24:51.900 --> 24:53.936
You dirty boy. Get up, man.

24:53.969 --> 24:56.171
- I can't even get a girl in my dreams.
- What?

24:56.605 --> 24:57.873
Nothing.

24:57.906 --> 24:59.774
What are you doing here anyway?

25:00.876 --> 25:02.077
I'm your mother.

25:02.611 --> 25:04.913
One not need me need invitation.

25:06.348 --> 25:09.051
I just come to, you know,
to see my one son.

25:09.084 --> 25:10.886
- Mom.
- Mm-hmm.

25:10.919 --> 25:13.322
- Mom.
- Mm-hmm.

25:14.056 --> 25:18.193
What? What? I... I was just...
I was just in the area

25:18.227 --> 25:20.062
and I... and I...
and I thought that I would...

25:20.896 --> 25:22.298
Alright, alright.

25:24.600 --> 25:27.169
I'm down the way to church
and... and...

25:27.202 --> 25:33.342
Well,
there's some really nice...

25:33.375 --> 25:35.210
I mean, nice.

25:35.244 --> 25:40.349
I mean, just... just decent
and godly women down there.

25:43.185 --> 25:46.288
You know, the kind that
you could just settle down with.

25:47.089 --> 25:48.290
Mom.

25:48.324 --> 25:50.025
Invite them to meet your mother.

25:50.059 --> 25:51.593
Who you've been speaking to,
Mom?

25:51.627 --> 25:53.962
Well, maybe a friend
did say something.

25:53.996 --> 25:56.965
- Who?
- The good-looking one.

25:58.133 --> 25:59.101
The ballet one.

25:59.935 --> 26:01.270
- Energy.
- Jirese?

26:01.303 --> 26:02.371
Him.

26:02.404 --> 26:05.074
Maybe... maybe, you know,
did say, just I don't...

26:05.107 --> 26:09.078
He just mentioned.
Just a little... just a little.

26:09.111 --> 26:11.246
You know, maybe see him
on the high street.

26:11.280 --> 26:13.882
I mean,
he never really say much.

26:13.916 --> 26:14.883
This is embarrassing.

26:14.917 --> 26:17.152
I don't need to go to church
to find a woman.

26:17.186 --> 26:19.988
Okay, if you say so.

26:24.126 --> 26:27.129
I'm going to church now
to pray for honor.

26:28.130 --> 26:29.998
Maybe God have a plan for me.

26:56.425 --> 26:59.461
Oh, hello, my friend.

26:59.495 --> 27:02.264
Oh, you again.
What are you doing here?

27:02.297 --> 27:03.665
I'm homeless, innit?

27:03.699 --> 27:09.071
A man of no fixed abode, a vagrant,
uh, from the Latin term vagary,

27:09.104 --> 27:11.306
to a wanderer about a bit
with not much to do.

27:11.740 --> 27:15.010
I move
where the spirit dictates.

27:15.043 --> 27:18.147
Guide to the course by the music
of the spheres.

27:18.180 --> 27:21.350
- What?
- Yeah, well which is a perfect paradigm concerning the fact

27:21.383 --> 27:24.953
the, uh, forces have guided me
directly to you, Sir.

27:24.987 --> 27:27.356
Oh. So, I suppose
you want that tenner, do you?

27:27.389 --> 27:30.426
Well, that would be a satisfactory
outcome considering, uh,

27:30.459 --> 27:35.297
our perambulatory talking is, uh,
due to do the course of nature,

27:35.330 --> 27:37.132
the seen and the unseen.

27:37.733 --> 27:39.268
Why do you talk like that,
anyway?

27:40.936 --> 27:44.406
Well, an inquiry mind is not just the
prerogative of the wealthy and elite, Sir.

27:44.440 --> 27:47.309
It is a universal birthright

27:47.342 --> 27:51.180
which is afforded to those who
take the opportunity to study,

27:51.213 --> 27:52.448
to pick up a book
and learn, Sir.

27:52.481 --> 27:57.186
- Okay, okay.
- Oh, major forces are at hand.

27:57.219 --> 27:59.988
You know the ones about
the seen and the unseen

28:00.022 --> 28:03.459
because you know, the only constant
thing in life is change, Sir.

28:04.092 --> 28:07.463
- Could I quote the Bard, William Shakespeare?
- Yeah.

28:08.096 --> 28:11.133
"There is something in the
heaven and Earth, Horatio,

28:11.166 --> 28:13.268
than are dreamt
of in your philosophy."

28:13.302 --> 28:18.140
Ooh. Major changes are coming to you.
Major changes are coming to you.

28:18.173 --> 28:21.043
- Whatever. Listen...
- Oh, yeah, that's 10.

28:21.076 --> 28:22.377
Good one... good...
good one, Shakespeare.

28:22.411 --> 28:24.012
Here you go, mate,
here is a tenner.

28:25.414 --> 28:26.315
- Yeah, it's alright. It's alright.
- Big changes are coming for you.

28:26.348 --> 28:28.283
- Alright.
- Big changes are coming for you.

28:28.317 --> 28:33.021
Big changes are coming for you.

28:44.166 --> 28:46.401
Damn, you are psychic.

28:46.435 --> 28:49.071
Yes, I am.

28:49.104 --> 28:51.440
Brian said
that you might be coming. Enter.

29:00.315 --> 29:01.350
Sit.

29:13.897 --> 29:18.066
So, what can Madame Ruby do
for you, my lovely?

29:19.301 --> 29:21.270
I don't even know
where to start.

29:21.303 --> 29:23.806
Do you know what, this is the first
time I've done anything like this.

29:23.840 --> 29:27.309
Um, um, I need a woman.

29:29.846 --> 29:31.446
This is not
that kind of service.

29:31.480 --> 29:33.248
I... I read palm.

29:33.282 --> 29:38.320
No, no, no, no, no, not like...
like, um, ah, how do I explain?

29:38.353 --> 29:40.122
Like, okay, look,

29:40.155 --> 29:42.324
I just want to find out like if
there's anything wrong with me.

29:42.357 --> 29:43.592
That's what...
that's what I've come here for.

29:44.459 --> 29:46.295
I don't think I can help you.

29:46.328 --> 29:48.430
You need NHS. I'm not a doctor.

29:48.463 --> 29:55.470
No. Oh, alright. Listen, um, alright,
so you... you read into the future, yeah?

29:55.504 --> 29:57.306
- I can.
- Okay, alright.

29:57.339 --> 30:00.542
So, I basically want
to find like my...

30:00.576 --> 30:04.346
The woman, my dream woman, you
know, you can look into the future

30:04.379 --> 30:05.581
and try and help me
maybe somehow.

30:06.315 --> 30:07.215
Okay.

30:07.583 --> 30:08.483
Okay.

30:09.384 --> 30:10.586
Give me your hands.

30:24.700 --> 30:27.436
Oh, you're so lonely.

30:28.637 --> 30:31.206
You are so, so lonely.

30:31.239 --> 30:37.646
But I... I... I...

30:44.720 --> 30:48.657
What? What? What?

30:52.260 --> 30:58.667
I'm getting Mel... Me...
Me... Melanie... Melanie.

30:59.401 --> 31:05.340
She's saying that she likes
the way you use your tongue

31:06.541 --> 31:13.248
and... and you have
a very big lunchbox?

31:13.281 --> 31:15.450
Oh. Melanie?

31:15.484 --> 31:17.285
Melanie Richards.

31:17.753 --> 31:19.922
She's been dead for 15 years.

31:19.956 --> 31:21.523
You see dead people?

31:21.556 --> 31:23.525
I'm only telling you
what I can see.

31:23.558 --> 31:25.928
No, no, no,
I have not come here for that.

31:25.962 --> 31:30.265
Can't you see anybody who's alive?
I want to find my dream girl now.

31:30.298 --> 31:33.936
- Okay, come on.
- Oh, my gosh!

31:40.676 --> 31:42.945
Oh!

31:42.979 --> 31:46.381
There is...
there is something blocking.

31:46.983 --> 31:48.583
There's... there's...
there's something blocking.

31:50.552 --> 31:51.453
What?

31:52.688 --> 31:54.423
What? What? What? What?

31:55.024 --> 31:55.958
He's gone.

31:55.992 --> 31:57.960
What do you mean gone?

31:57.994 --> 31:59.294
Gone where?

31:59.327 --> 32:00.897
Gone where? Find it.

32:00.930 --> 32:05.567
Go back to whatever you was doing be...
do the... do that. Go back. Come on.

32:05.600 --> 32:06.601
You have to find it.

32:06.635 --> 32:07.669
It... it is gone.

32:07.703 --> 32:10.807
Once the vision is gone,
it's gone.

32:11.540 --> 32:14.710
There's somebody out there
for you but you must find her.

32:14.743 --> 32:15.544
How?

32:15.577 --> 32:17.579
I don't know,
I'm not a detective.

32:17.612 --> 32:20.449
- But you must find her.
- Okay.

32:20.817 --> 32:22.718
You've been amazing. Thank you so much.
Thank you. Thank you.

32:22.751 --> 32:25.822
- I love you. I love you. Muah. I love you.
- Wait, wait, wait.

32:29.491 --> 32:30.425
There's more? There's more?

32:31.359 --> 32:32.394
You have to pay.

32:39.334 --> 32:41.770
- Ashley. Asher.
- Broski.

32:41.804 --> 32:45.440
Bruv, listen, I need to set up like
a Tinder online dating profile thing.

32:45.474 --> 32:46.508
Give me two seconds.

32:48.376 --> 32:49.511
- Look.
- What's that?

32:49.544 --> 32:50.545
Man's already looked after you,
bruv.

32:50.579 --> 32:51.781
- I've set the profile for you already.
- Yes.

32:51.814 --> 32:53.216
Yes, trust me. I've got your
main picture up already here.

32:53.248 --> 32:56.685
- Yeah.
- You scroll down and you just got these little three blocks.

32:56.718 --> 32:59.354
You just gotta add the pictures
that you want to put in here.

32:59.387 --> 33:02.058
As soon as you do that, finish
that, then the matches come up.

33:02.091 --> 33:04.060
Just scroll through your matches and
send them messages and that's it.

33:04.093 --> 33:05.761
- Simple.
- What? It's that easy?

33:05.795 --> 33:08.296
- That easy, bro.
- What?

33:08.330 --> 33:09.664
- Bruv!
- Trust me.

33:09.698 --> 33:11.033
- That's wicked.
- Yeah.

33:11.067 --> 33:13.635
All you got... Do you know what
though, watch out for the catfish.

33:13.668 --> 33:14.669
What's that?

33:16.005 --> 33:18.607
I was trying to meet this one girl
called Renee for months, bruv.

33:18.640 --> 33:20.709
- Yeah.
- We're talking, we're texting,

33:20.742 --> 33:22.779
she's sending me nudes,
everything, boom.

33:22.812 --> 33:24.814
So I'm saying, "Okay, let's...
let's... let's meet."

33:24.847 --> 33:26.314
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

33:26.348 --> 33:28.683
Now, always avoiding me, yes.
I thought, okay, let me... let me do this.

33:28.717 --> 33:31.453
I'll go and surprise her.
I'll turn up to her work.

33:31.486 --> 33:34.389
I'm at the bus stop now, yeah,
get the phone out and call.

33:34.422 --> 33:36.058
Phone starts ringing
to the left of me, bruv.

33:36.092 --> 33:38.627
I look around, it's a man,
bruv, who's answering.

33:38.660 --> 33:41.396
- Oh.
- Trust me. That's what I'm saying, bruv.

33:41.429 --> 33:43.398
Yeah. Trust me, yeah.

33:43.431 --> 33:45.534
So watch out them
for the fake profiles, bruv.

33:45.567 --> 33:46.768
Bruv, respect for the heads up,
man.

33:46.803 --> 33:47.602
- Respect, bruv.
- Thanks, bruv.

33:47.636 --> 33:50.072
Yo, Ash,
are you seeing Reesh later?

33:50.106 --> 33:53.742
Nah, bruv, um, we had a proper
full-blown.

33:54.376 --> 33:56.678
Oh, mate,
sorry to hear about that, man.

33:56.711 --> 33:58.881
No, but this time, brother,
that's it.

33:59.614 --> 34:01.483
Bro, I thought she was the one.

34:01.516 --> 34:04.452
Nah, bruv, it is what it is.

34:04.486 --> 34:06.421
- If it's done, it's done, innit?
- No, man.

34:06.454 --> 34:08.757
Bro, listen,
you need to kiss her, hug her,

34:08.791 --> 34:09.892
make her feel like
she's the one, bruv.

34:10.625 --> 34:11.459
Trust me, man.

34:11.493 --> 34:13.762
Do it like your life
depended on it.

34:13.796 --> 34:14.797
That's what they do
in the movies.

34:14.831 --> 34:19.734
Well, I ain't no Richard Gere.
But, yeah, thanks.

34:31.446 --> 34:33.049
I knew I'll find you here,
you know.

34:33.082 --> 34:35.717
What are you getting done now? Have you even got space?

34:35.750 --> 34:37.320
Just getting some more inks,
man.

34:37.352 --> 34:39.889
I'm gonna just, you know, tidy them up
a bit, bring it down the whole sleeve.

34:39.922 --> 34:41.456
You know how you do this thing,
man.

34:41.489 --> 34:43.592
- What's good, anyway?
- We need to get Trey go.

34:43.625 --> 34:44.626
We need to get Trey go.

34:44.659 --> 34:47.163
We need to hit bars, clubs,
wherever, however.

34:47.196 --> 34:50.132
So you came all the way
to Battersea just to say that.

34:50.166 --> 34:51.200
But already got no credit.

34:51.234 --> 34:53.435
Listen, the reason is I need
to borrow your car.

34:55.370 --> 34:57.539
Seriously, please.
I need to see this girl.

34:57.572 --> 34:58.875
Bro, you better take Uber, man.

34:58.908 --> 35:00.575
You don't know about Simone?

35:00.609 --> 35:01.776
Simone?

35:03.012 --> 35:06.414
Simone got to, the girl in the
highest tax bracket, Simone.

35:06.448 --> 35:07.783
I don't know, man. No.

35:07.817 --> 35:10.418
Listen, she throws a banging
VIP party.

35:10.452 --> 35:12.621
And listen, there's gonna be
bad girls there, it's heavy.

35:12.654 --> 35:14.756
- No, I'm good, man. I'm gonna chill this week.
- Okay.

35:15.791 --> 35:20.830
Actually we're gonna need
four invitations.

35:20.863 --> 35:22.464
Alright.
Listen, she's family, man.

35:22.497 --> 35:23.799
- I've got you both, 100 percent.
- Yeah.

35:23.833 --> 35:24.867
- Cool, man.
- Love.

35:24.901 --> 35:26.401
Alright, brother, later.
So, can I borrow your car?

35:35.011 --> 35:36.779
high, you know.

35:36.812 --> 35:37.914
Exactly.

35:40.950 --> 35:42.985
What is this?

35:44.253 --> 35:45.855
- Is this where you taking me to?
- Yeah?

35:47.656 --> 35:48.891
- You like it?
- Of course, I like it.

35:48.925 --> 35:50.492
Party.

35:50.960 --> 35:55.730
Hey. Wow.

35:56.498 --> 35:59.701
This is a madness.

36:00.236 --> 36:02.470
- We have arrived.
- Come on, come on.

36:06.275 --> 36:08.610
Oh, wow.

36:08.978 --> 36:10.813
- Whoa!
- Hello.

36:10.846 --> 36:12.014
- Hi.
- Kai's friends, right?

36:12.048 --> 36:14.482
Yes, my name is Jirese.
And this is...

36:14.516 --> 36:18.687
- Jason. Pleased to meet you.
- I am Cruz. Good to see you.

36:18.720 --> 36:20.722
Has our friend arrived...
Trey, Treyvon?

36:20.755 --> 36:23.558
He's about my height
and weird...

36:23.591 --> 36:25.227
Look like him
but not as good looking as me.

36:32.868 --> 36:34.804
Not by now, but do come in.

36:35.537 --> 36:37.273
- Ladies first.
- Thank you.

36:37.306 --> 36:38.606
After you.

36:44.546 --> 36:45.714
Wow.

36:46.648 --> 36:47.883
Nice place.

36:47.917 --> 36:51.686
Um, you guys are early so might
as well get a drink at the bar?

36:51.720 --> 36:53.722
She's got the bar.
She got the bar.

36:53.755 --> 36:56.058
Most people have a fridge
but she got the whole bar.

36:56.092 --> 36:57.726
Sounds good to me.

36:57.759 --> 36:58.861
- I'm with you, man.
- Through there?

36:58.894 --> 37:00.662
- Through there, yeah.
- Thank you.

37:07.903 --> 37:09.839
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

37:09.872 --> 37:11.273
- Thank you.
- You know, I'm gonna go and call Trey.

37:11.307 --> 37:12.241
- Okay, mate. Yeah.
- Yeah?

37:12.274 --> 37:14.743
I'm gonna head outside
and join the party.

37:14.776 --> 37:16.511
No worries.
I'll come back for that.

37:17.579 --> 37:20.883
So, uh, do you have
many parties here?

37:20.916 --> 37:21.817
I do actually.

37:23.386 --> 37:26.956
- <i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>
- Trey, it's us, man.

37:26.989 --> 37:28.623
I'm at the spot,
we are at the place.

37:28.656 --> 37:30.893
You need to hurry up, man.
The guys are waiting, yeah.

37:30.926 --> 37:32.727
Don't be on no long-ting,
please, man.

37:32.761 --> 37:35.798
Hurry up. Alright. See you soon.
Alright, bless. Bye.

37:42.905 --> 37:43.973
Yo, uh, what's going?

37:44.006 --> 37:46.042
- Yo, you alright?
- Yeah, man, I'm blessed, brother.

37:46.075 --> 37:47.043
- You alright?
- I'm good, man.

37:47.076 --> 37:48.743
- Long time.
- I know, bruv.

37:48.778 --> 37:50.046
It's just a quick workout today,
bro.

37:50.079 --> 37:52.081
- Okay, cool. Cool.
- Yeah. Anything in there?

37:52.114 --> 37:54.050
- Too many, man. Too many.
- Are you serious?

37:54.083 --> 37:55.683
Yeah. I can't imagine.

37:55.717 --> 37:56.651
- Yeah.
- Go have your fun, man.

37:56.684 --> 37:59.088
Wish me, bruv. Alright, thanks.

38:02.825 --> 38:04.759
- Oh!
- Bro, where have you been?

38:04.794 --> 38:07.029
- You're late.
- I know. I'm sorry, bruv. I'm sorry, man.

38:07.063 --> 38:08.330
I had some property stuff
to deal with.

38:08.364 --> 38:11.033
Listen, so you just go,
I'm gonna quickly grab a drink, yeah.

38:11.067 --> 38:11.901
- Alright.
- Alright.

38:11.934 --> 38:13.102
- See you in a bit.
- See you in a bit.

38:25.647 --> 38:27.715
That's... Oh, no.

38:29.118 --> 38:30.685
Oh, wait... hello.

38:32.088 --> 38:33.989
Hold on, wait, it is you.

38:34.023 --> 38:35.357
I didn't know
that you trained here.

38:35.391 --> 38:37.827
Yeah. I didn't know you trained.

38:38.394 --> 38:41.163
Oh, listen, is it alright if like
I jump in and we could do like...

38:41.197 --> 38:44.900
Oh, I don't think so.
I've literally just finished.

38:44.934 --> 38:47.403
So, it's time for me to stretch
and leave, actually.

38:47.436 --> 38:49.872
Alright. Listen, um, how often
do you train down here?

38:50.172 --> 38:51.907
Often enough.

38:51.941 --> 38:54.076
So then maybe like
we could train together, like...

38:54.110 --> 38:55.978
Um, I doubt that very much.

38:56.011 --> 38:58.414
I'm just gonna leave now.
I've finished now.

38:58.447 --> 39:00.883
So if you want to take over,
knock yourself out.

39:01.716 --> 39:02.650
Yeah, but...

39:03.886 --> 39:04.887
I'll see you later.

39:05.720 --> 39:07.123
Oh, man.

39:07.156 --> 39:08.690
Oh, God.

39:08.723 --> 39:09.959
Bruv, tell me that's you.

39:09.992 --> 39:11.961
- No, man.
- That's gonna be you, bruv.

39:12.694 --> 39:14.130
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

39:14.163 --> 39:16.664
Thank you so much
for inviting us

39:16.698 --> 39:18.200
- to this amazing party.
- No, you're welcome.

39:47.029 --> 39:47.930
Whoa!

40:13.189 --> 40:15.791
- So how many sets are we doing?
- Probably about three more.

40:15.824 --> 40:18.460
- I feel mashed up rough, trust me.
- Magical.

40:18.494 --> 40:20.728
Yo, what you're saying?
You cool?

40:20.762 --> 40:22.498
- What are you saying, bruv?
- He's saying cool. Yeah.

40:22.531 --> 40:24.266
Yeah, yeah, I've seen you
looking at that girl over.

40:24.300 --> 40:25.134
What, the one in the gray?

40:25.167 --> 40:26.768
Yeah, the one
that was in the splits.

40:26.802 --> 40:29.238
Yes, she was good stuff.

40:29.271 --> 40:31.273
How do you know
that she likes you though?

40:33.309 --> 40:34.476
That's what I'm trying to say.

40:34.510 --> 40:36.879
You are perving on a girl
that's just trying to work out.

40:36.912 --> 40:38.280
And you don't even know
she's your type.

40:38.314 --> 40:39.848
What's wrong with this guy?

40:39.882 --> 40:41.483
Or you're even her type.

40:41.517 --> 40:43.953
And I know for a fact
you're not her type.

40:43.986 --> 40:45.888
Bruv, why... what's going on?
What are you coming up...

40:45.921 --> 40:47.856
Bruv, I'm just saying,
some people just want to work out,

40:47.890 --> 40:49.792
and you're out here
trying to grab girls.

40:49.825 --> 40:50.960
Girls don't want you.

40:50.993 --> 40:52.494
She might not want
to talk to you.

40:52.528 --> 40:54.797
She might not like you one bit,
bruv.

40:55.164 --> 40:56.232
She's young.

40:56.265 --> 40:58.033
You're old.

40:59.235 --> 41:01.103
You're just a whole
different breed.

41:01.136 --> 41:03.839
Bruv, who come to the gym
dressed like Venom.

41:03.872 --> 41:05.140
Get out of here, man.

41:05.174 --> 41:06.809
- That's easy, you know.
- Leave this brother alone, man.

41:06.842 --> 41:08.010
It's that people work out, man.

41:14.250 --> 41:15.918
Francis, you're still here.

41:15.951 --> 41:18.053
Hey, how are you doing?

41:18.087 --> 41:19.888
- I'm fine, thanks.
- Good, good.

41:19.922 --> 41:22.324
Listen, I know we got off
to a bad start, yeah,

41:22.358 --> 41:24.793
but maybe like we could train
together or something.

41:24.827 --> 41:27.129
Look, we both know
you couldn't keep up with me

41:27.162 --> 41:29.331
if you trained with me,
so let's just leave it there.

41:29.365 --> 41:32.067
Wow. That's big talk. Alright, alright.
What about this then...

41:32.101 --> 41:35.904
One day, when you're not working,
yeah, if like I come over...

41:35.938 --> 41:38.874
Oh, no, you come over
and we get some food.

41:38.907 --> 41:40.142
That...
that's never gonna happen.

41:40.175 --> 41:41.243
And I can cook...

41:46.181 --> 41:48.884
Babes, who is this?

41:49.218 --> 41:51.086
You remember the client
I was telling you about,

41:51.120 --> 41:52.321
the one that's renovating
the old boxing gym.

41:52.354 --> 41:55.190
Yeah, listen,
didn't she tell you about me?

41:55.224 --> 41:58.861
Like, I'm a client and basically...
you told him... Did you tell him?

41:58.894 --> 42:00.596
You never said to him anything
about like I'm...

42:00.629 --> 42:04.166
So basically, I buy and sell
properties and she's...

42:04.199 --> 42:06.268
you know what she does,
that's your girl, innit? Obviously.

42:06.302 --> 42:08.837
And, um, do you...
You train here as well?

42:08.871 --> 42:11.206
- Does he train here?
- Look, about the renovation,

42:11.240 --> 42:13.142
I'll be speaking to you soon
about it.

42:13.175 --> 42:15.010
So, um, I'll see you later.

42:15.044 --> 42:18.047
Okay, alright.
Well, it was good to see you.

42:18.080 --> 42:21.817
And I will be in contact
regarding the... the property.

42:46.975 --> 42:47.876
Hello.

42:49.278 --> 42:50.446
Yeah. Ash, what's up?

42:52.348 --> 42:54.383
No, no, just on my way back
from the office.

42:55.317 --> 42:56.218
What?

42:57.119 --> 42:58.387
Why are you reading
my messages, bruv?

42:58.420 --> 43:00.155
I was just about to use it.

43:00.189 --> 43:02.324
You left it open
and it just popped up.

43:02.358 --> 43:05.961
Anyway, she wants
to meet you tonight, T.

43:05.994 --> 43:07.062
Where?

43:07.096 --> 43:09.932
Bruv, trust me, she is banging.

43:09.965 --> 43:11.100
I would.

43:11.133 --> 43:13.268
Alright.
Listen, text me the details.

43:13.302 --> 43:14.336
Yeah.

43:14.370 --> 43:15.304
Alright, alright.

43:16.171 --> 43:17.906
Yeah, thanks. Alright. Bye.

43:18.273 --> 43:19.308
Alright. Alright.

43:47.102 --> 43:48.003
Hey.

43:48.971 --> 43:49.905
Move.

43:50.739 --> 43:52.107
Hey. Listen.

44:01.250 --> 44:03.185
Oi! Oi!
Wait, what are you doing?

44:05.354 --> 44:06.422
Are you alright?

44:07.456 --> 44:08.991
- Are you okay?
- Shit.

44:09.024 --> 44:11.293
- I'm alright.
- Can you sit up?

44:13.128 --> 44:14.496
Try to get up little if you can.

44:16.432 --> 44:18.167
Come on.

44:18.200 --> 44:19.101
Are you okay?

44:20.369 --> 44:22.070
- I can't believe it.
- Don't worry.

44:22.471 --> 44:24.072
Aaargh!

44:24.106 --> 44:25.207
Do I know you from somewhere?

44:27.342 --> 44:30.012
Hold on, you're her.

44:30.045 --> 44:32.181
Yeah. You took my number
and you didn't use it.

44:32.214 --> 44:33.982
- No, no, no, no.
- It's okay, though.

44:34.016 --> 44:35.184
Listen, no, what happened...

44:35.217 --> 44:37.052
It's fine. It's fine.

44:37.085 --> 44:39.755
You're in pain. Okay,
should I call the police, ambulance or...

44:39.789 --> 44:40.857
No, no, no police.

44:40.890 --> 44:43.425
It's okay. It's alright, I'll...
I'll call my friend.

44:44.760 --> 44:46.361
- It's alright.
- Did they hurt you anywhere else?

44:46.395 --> 44:48.230
- Did they cut you anywhere?
- No.

44:49.231 --> 44:50.299
Oh, my phone's not working.

44:51.567 --> 44:53.235
You can use my phone, right?

44:55.571 --> 44:58.207
Shit, I've left it at home.
So, look, I live around the block, right,

44:58.240 --> 45:01.076
so you can just come around
the block with me at my house

45:01.109 --> 45:01.945
and you can just use
my phone there.

45:01.977 --> 45:03.278
- Are you sure?
- Use the phone at home.

45:03.312 --> 45:04.146
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure...
- Yeah, but you don't even know me.

45:04.179 --> 45:06.315
Marvin's there.
It's fine. It's okay.

45:06.348 --> 45:08.350
- Just gotta get you cleaned up. Yeah?
- You sure?

45:08.383 --> 45:11.086
Yeah, yeah, sure. Come, let's just go.

45:11.119 --> 45:12.387
- Can you...
- Yeah.

45:13.055 --> 45:14.756
Just put your arm
around me like this.

45:14.791 --> 45:17.059
- Oh, my God! I can't believe this.
- Just take it easy.

45:17.092 --> 45:17.993
Just take it easy.

45:19.595 --> 45:23.098
- ]
- Oh, shit.

45:24.266 --> 45:26.502
Oops. Oops, oops, oops.

45:40.582 --> 45:42.217
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, come.

45:42.251 --> 45:43.452
Oh, that's Marvin.

45:46.622 --> 45:49.124
Do you want me to offer you
a drink whilst you're waiting?

45:49.157 --> 45:51.460
I can't believe I've actually
got a strange man in my house

45:51.493 --> 45:52.728
and I can't even remember
your name.

45:52.761 --> 45:56.431
Okay, so my name is Shenisha.
Um, and you can call me Shen.

45:56.465 --> 45:58.200
Nice to meet you,
my name's Treyvon.

45:58.233 --> 45:59.268
- Ah.
- Hello.

45:59.301 --> 46:01.169
Hi, Treyvon. That's it, Treyvon?

46:01.203 --> 46:02.337
Yeah.

46:02.371 --> 46:04.339
- I'll go and get a drink for you and...
- Thank you.

46:04.373 --> 46:06.241
- Get some water for your face.
- Thank you.

46:06.843 --> 46:11.246
<i>I can't believe I'm
inside her house here with her</i>

46:11.280 --> 46:12.481
<i>and she's touching my face.</i>

46:12.514 --> 46:14.283
<i>I don't let no girl
touch my face.</i>

46:15.384 --> 46:18.420
<i>Look at her eyes.
I think she's perfect.</i>

46:19.655 --> 46:22.090
<i>Oh, and she's got dimples
as well.</i>

46:22.124 --> 46:24.192
<i>I didn't even realize
she had dimples.</i>

46:24.226 --> 46:26.194
<i>This is just getting better.</i>

46:26.228 --> 46:29.398
<i>When you make a girl giggle
like that, you're in.</i>

46:29.431 --> 46:31.199
- Is it?
- January 7th.

46:31.233 --> 46:32.568
Yeah, yeah. I got you.

46:33.836 --> 46:36.605
Oh, that must be your friend.
Let me go and get him first.

46:41.476 --> 46:42.879
Oh, what happened to you?

46:42.912 --> 46:45.414
Bruv, some madness, bruv.

46:45.915 --> 46:50.385
So you know I went to go
and meet, um, my friend, yeah,

46:50.419 --> 46:53.622
and I'm waiting in my car,
within five minutes about seven or...

46:53.655 --> 46:55.424
There's at least ten of them
actually.

46:55.457 --> 46:57.192
Men just surrounded my car,
bruv.

46:57.225 --> 46:58.193
- What?
- Yeah.

46:58.226 --> 46:59.829
There was enough of them
to surround my car.

46:59.862 --> 47:03.066
I heard the man talking about he's gonna
pull out a metal pipe and all that crap.

47:03.465 --> 47:05.367
So I jumped out
and I confronted them.

47:05.400 --> 47:06.602
No, no, you know what I'm like.

47:06.635 --> 47:07.736
But why didn't you call me
sooner?

47:07.769 --> 47:10.339
Bruv, I wish. I didn't have time.
I jumped out.

47:10.372 --> 47:14.476
I'm grappling with two of them, punched one
of them in the head. I know I broke his nose.

47:14.509 --> 47:15.878
I broke one of their...
Look at my hand.

47:15.912 --> 47:20.382
- Yeah, he broke his arm.
- Listen, yeah, so anyway, bruv,

47:20.415 --> 47:21.717
I appreciate you coming, man.

47:22.451 --> 47:23.285
Thanks, man.

47:23.318 --> 47:26.221
Thank you, bruv.
I appreciate it, man.

47:26.254 --> 47:28.290
- Yeah, nice meeting you.
- Very nice meeting you.

47:28.323 --> 47:31.193
- You take care of him. Yeah.
- Nice to... Thank you.

47:31.226 --> 47:33.595
- No, I really appreciate...
- No worries.

47:33.629 --> 47:35.530
- ...you looking after me.
- It's okay.

47:35.564 --> 47:37.165
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

47:37.532 --> 47:41.503
- Uh, alright. Thanks. Alright.
- Take... take care.

47:41.536 --> 47:42.939
Okay.

47:42.972 --> 47:44.339
Uh, thank you.

47:51.279 --> 47:52.681
Ball of fire.

47:53.615 --> 47:54.917
- Pow.
- On the 5.

47:55.952 --> 47:57.920
Like that, yeah.
Like that, yeah.

47:57.954 --> 48:00.188
Not today. Not today.

48:00.222 --> 48:01.490
Yeah, I think you see my cards.

48:01.523 --> 48:02.925
You're lucky. You're lucky.
You're lucky.

48:02.959 --> 48:04.359
What happened
last night, anyways?

48:04.393 --> 48:07.362
I would have been there in a flash.
You know I'm about this thing.

48:08.998 --> 48:10.532
Bro, you should have called me.

48:10.565 --> 48:13.635
Bruv, who do you think I would have called?
I would have called you, yes.

48:13.669 --> 48:15.604
Mr. Shadow Boxer over there,
you're mad.

48:15.637 --> 48:17.406
I mean it.

48:17.439 --> 48:18.373
Who guess it?

48:18.407 --> 48:19.976
Um, I think it's yours, yeah.

48:20.009 --> 48:21.610
Bruv, I need to find this girl,
you know.

48:21.643 --> 48:22.678
She helped me, bro.

48:22.711 --> 48:23.780
I need to see her again.

48:23.813 --> 48:25.647
- Your phone's smashed, innit?
- Exactly.

48:26.348 --> 48:27.683
Yeah,
I left her my business card

48:27.716 --> 48:29.484
but I don't know
if she's even gonna call though.

48:29.518 --> 48:30.787
Don't you know where she lives?

48:31.720 --> 48:34.423
I went to her house last night
but it was dark.

48:34.456 --> 48:35.724
So I don't even know
if I remember.

48:35.757 --> 48:37.526
You do remember.
Go there right now.

48:38.027 --> 48:40.495
Who turns up at a girl's house
like they don't know?

48:40.529 --> 48:42.397
Like, this is the...
I only met her once, you know.

48:42.999 --> 48:43.732
It doesn't matter.

48:46.268 --> 48:48.437
- Really?
- Yeah, I'll do it 100 percent.

48:48.470 --> 48:49.371
Yeah, he would.

48:49.404 --> 48:51.673
This guy. You're a joker.

48:55.610 --> 48:57.713
Now, where is it? Where is it?

49:23.338 --> 49:24.439
Yeah, that is it.

49:25.307 --> 49:26.175
Who are you?

49:27.609 --> 49:29.779
What do you want?
Who are you here for?

49:30.545 --> 49:32.280
And the rose flowers for?

49:32.314 --> 49:33.548
Are they for Shenisha?

49:34.083 --> 49:35.317
Shenisha.

49:35.617 --> 49:37.019
Who is Sheni...

49:37.053 --> 49:38.620
No, I don't know any Shenisha.

49:38.653 --> 49:41.289
- Is that who lives here?
- Shenisha lives here.

49:41.323 --> 49:45.560
Oh, this is... No,
this is 67 I was looking for.

49:45.594 --> 49:47.295
These flowers, Sister Margaret.

49:47.329 --> 49:48.764
I was looking
for Sister Margaret.

49:48.798 --> 49:50.499
That's... yeah, because yeah...

49:50.532 --> 49:52.768
No, she lives at 67.

49:52.802 --> 49:56.505
She's... she's sick. She's sick.
I brought them for poor Sister Margaret.

49:56.538 --> 49:58.373
Poor Sister Margaret,
she is dying.

49:58.406 --> 50:00.475
Sister Margaret!

50:00.509 --> 50:01.844
Sister Margaret! She's not in.

50:02.812 --> 50:05.680
Hey, don't be doing
that nonsense crap.

50:05.714 --> 50:07.582
Tiny.

50:08.350 --> 50:10.052
- Hey, Treyvon?
- Hello, Shen love.

50:11.586 --> 50:14.056
Get back to bed. Get to the bed.

50:14.090 --> 50:15.490
Look, do you wanna go in?

50:15.524 --> 50:18.493
I've done most of the packing already
but the heavy stuff is upstairs.

50:18.527 --> 50:20.529
- Okay.
- I'm sure Marvin will be happy to see you.

50:20.562 --> 50:21.429
Alright.

50:21.463 --> 50:23.532
I've got an appointment later,
alright.

50:23.565 --> 50:24.801
- Okay. Alright.
- I'm working late.

50:27.870 --> 50:30.405
- Tiny?
- Yeah.

50:30.438 --> 50:31.908
Ain't nothing tiny about him.

50:31.941 --> 50:34.844
He looks like he's been stung by a
thousand bees and he's allergic to it.

50:35.577 --> 50:37.880
Anyway, um, yeah, um,
these are for you.

50:37.914 --> 50:39.681
Oh, thank you.
That's kind of you.

50:39.714 --> 50:43.585
You know, you didn't have to but I was just doing
my friendly neighborhood bit and everything.

50:43.618 --> 50:46.354
- Yeah.
- But, yeah, and I hate bullies, by the way, so.

50:46.388 --> 50:48.490
- Are you moving?
- Yeah, well, kinda.

50:48.523 --> 50:52.494
No, yeah, I am, yeah, my tenancy
agreement is finished so I've got to go.

50:52.527 --> 50:53.830
But, listen,
I'd love to speak to you

50:53.863 --> 50:55.564
but I've got an appointment
and I've got to go.

50:55.597 --> 50:57.099
Okay. Yeah, but look,
I was just gonna ask, um,

50:57.133 --> 50:59.668
can I maybe take you out
to dinner, lunch, coffee maybe?

50:59.701 --> 51:00.837
A date? Listen, that's so sweet

51:00.870 --> 51:02.470
but I've got a date
already tonight, so.

51:02.872 --> 51:04.841
- Oh, you got...
- Yeah, with my kids.

51:04.874 --> 51:06.108
You've got a kid?

51:06.142 --> 51:07.844
Well, five of them.

51:07.877 --> 51:10.545
- Five?
- Yeah. But, listen, I've got to go.

51:23.960 --> 51:25.127
Hi, guys.

51:25.161 --> 51:26.461
- Hey, Miss.
- You alright?

51:26.494 --> 51:27.429
Yeah, I'm good, thanks.

51:29.598 --> 51:31.466
Guys, continue doing
what you're doing, okay?

51:31.499 --> 51:32.534
I'm going to make
a quick phone call

51:32.567 --> 51:33.568
and I'm going to be back,
alright?

51:33.602 --> 51:34.636
- Alright, Miss.
- Okay.

51:48.851 --> 51:50.518
<i>Please leave a message
after the tone.</i>

51:50.920 --> 51:52.288
Hi. Hi, it's Shenisha.

51:52.321 --> 51:56.491
Okay, yeah, um, so I'm doing evening
courses in photography, right,

51:56.524 --> 51:59.494
and, um, this week,
we're shooting in London locations

51:59.527 --> 52:02.731
and I was kind of like thinking
if you would like to join me

52:02.764 --> 52:06.601
and, perhaps, we can go
for a bite to eat after.

52:06.635 --> 52:09.939
So 8:00 AM tomorrow morning,
Tate Modern.

52:10.672 --> 52:11.740
Okay, yeah, bye.

52:14.911 --> 52:18.915
<i>♪ You are my everything ♪</i>

52:18.948 --> 52:22.550
<i>♪ You are my one and only ♪</i>

52:22.584 --> 52:24.586
<i>♪ Ooh-hoo ♪</i>

52:24.954 --> 52:27.589
Ha-ha.

52:27.622 --> 52:29.792
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:29.825 --> 52:31.360
Can't a man be happy or what?

52:31.394 --> 52:35.497
Bro, happy is good but it's 6:00 AM in
the morning and I want to take a piss.

52:35.831 --> 52:38.968
No one's this happy,
this early in the morning.

52:39.936 --> 52:44.439
Well, I am. So, if you'll excuse
me, I need to get ready.

52:44.840 --> 52:48.543
<i>♪ You are my everything ♪</i>

53:11.700 --> 53:13.836
Hi, so you came.

53:13.869 --> 53:15.737
- I told you. You alright?
- How you doing? You alright?

53:17.639 --> 53:18.773
- Come, let's go this way.
- Yeah?

53:18.808 --> 53:19.708
- Yeah, yeah.
- Alright.

53:21.911 --> 53:23.545
- I love mornings like this.
- Yeah.

53:23.578 --> 53:24.981
You know, especially,
in the wintertime

53:25.014 --> 53:27.850
when it's nice and cold,
calm and it's still.

53:27.883 --> 53:29.018
It's a bit too cold for me.

53:29.051 --> 53:30.485
Yeah.

53:30.886 --> 53:31.954
What do you do anyway?

53:31.988 --> 53:34.023
Um, yeah, I'm into property.

53:34.056 --> 53:35.257
- Property.
- Yeah.

53:35.291 --> 53:37.026
I wish I did
something like that,

53:37.059 --> 53:38.995
especially the fact that
I'm nearly going to be homeless.

53:39.028 --> 53:41.263
Oh, don't say that.
What do you do anyway?

53:41.297 --> 53:43.299
I work with children
in the community, yeah.

53:43.332 --> 53:44.867
So I try to keep them
off the streets.

53:44.900 --> 53:46.869
Oh, the five kids.

53:46.902 --> 53:48.570
- Yeah.
- Makes sense now.

53:49.571 --> 53:50.638
Yep, it sure does make sense.

53:50.672 --> 53:53.309
Yeah. But I don't know
for how much longer though.

53:53.342 --> 53:54.576
Why? What do you mean?

53:55.077 --> 53:56.611
Ah, never mind.

53:56.644 --> 53:57.913
Look, let's go.

53:58.646 --> 53:59.949
I've got a couple
more spots to hit.

53:59.982 --> 54:01.616
Oh, okay then.

54:12.995 --> 54:14.897
Where would you like
to go today, sweet?

54:14.930 --> 54:16.866
Oh, I've got a list
to make it easier. Thank you.

54:16.899 --> 54:17.967
- That's no problem.
- Cheers.

54:18.000 --> 54:21.871
You want to go to Albert Bridge,
Trafalgar Square,

54:21.904 --> 54:24.706
Hampstead Heath
and Buckingham Palace...

54:24.739 --> 54:27.810
Yeah, but can we stop off also
at, um, Hyde Park as well, please?

54:27.843 --> 54:29.812
- That's no problem, sweet.
- Thank you.

54:29.845 --> 54:31.881
You want to go
to five different destinations?

54:31.914 --> 54:33.149
Yeah.

54:33.182 --> 54:35.717
Brother, could you just take us
to Buckingham Palace, please?

54:35.750 --> 54:36.919
That's no problem, fella.

54:36.952 --> 54:38.187
Thank you.

54:38.220 --> 54:40.856
- So what about that? That's nice, innit?
- That's Hyde Park.

54:40.890 --> 54:41.924
A mini Hyde Park.

54:41.957 --> 54:44.326
This actually this...
this area is really nice.

54:44.360 --> 54:45.693
What is this area?

55:28.904 --> 55:32.108
And so that concludes the
presentation, ladies and gentlemen.

55:32.141 --> 55:34.977
If there are any questions you'd
like to ask, please feel free.

55:36.145 --> 55:39.115
Uh, yeah, um, why is it so thin?

55:39.849 --> 55:40.816
What?

55:42.251 --> 55:44.053
Well, I mean, you want me to invest
300 grand in something this thin?

55:44.086 --> 55:44.854
Yeah.

55:44.887 --> 55:46.422
It's a fair point there,
actually.

55:46.455 --> 55:50.159
Uh, maybe I can bulk it out with some
of those traffic management studies.

55:52.094 --> 55:53.162
So, what do you reckon?

55:53.195 --> 55:54.897
I think if I had 300 grand,
I'll be definitely in.

55:56.298 --> 55:59.101
To get 300 grand, you've
got to get a job in the first place.

55:59.135 --> 56:01.170
Hmm, fair point.

56:13.249 --> 56:14.749
Come on, give me two.

56:18.787 --> 56:20.956
So, Miss, are we really
gonna lose this place?

56:20.990 --> 56:22.191
Don't worry.
It's gonna be fine, alright?

56:22.958 --> 56:24.793
- Where are we gonna train?
- Don't worry.

56:24.827 --> 56:26.728
You don't have to worry about anything.
It's gonna be fine.

56:26.761 --> 56:27.796
Yeah, right.

56:28.264 --> 56:29.932
Oh, really? Give me ten.

56:29.965 --> 56:31.901
- That's light.
- It's light?

56:31.934 --> 56:33.903
Okay, how about give me 50 then?

56:34.803 --> 56:37.173
Yeah, exactly.
I'll be back in a sec.

56:58.928 --> 57:01.130
So, how's...
how's the deal going, bro?

57:02.097 --> 57:04.800
Yeah, it's kind of right,
you know.

57:05.267 --> 57:07.735
Um, should be done in about
three weeks, the contract.

57:07.769 --> 57:10.105
Nice. So, is she the one then?

57:10.772 --> 57:12.774
- Who?
- Really, bro?

57:12.808 --> 57:14.243
You ain't stop talking
about her. Come on.

57:14.977 --> 57:17.213
Oh, yeah. No.

57:17.246 --> 57:19.982
Bruv, I don't know, man, like, this girl...
she's leaving anyway.

57:20.015 --> 57:21.817
Yeah, but where's she going?

57:21.850 --> 57:23.319
Don't know, bruv,
but she's moving.

57:23.352 --> 57:26.222
Well, wherever she's going, I'm sure
they've got mobile phones. Come on.

57:26.255 --> 57:30.025
Yeah, true, but I'm not sure, man.
Like, you know the worst thing?

57:30.059 --> 57:32.528
I was actually gonna call her,
you know, and ask her on a date.

57:32.561 --> 57:34.129
Do it like the traditional way.

57:34.530 --> 57:35.998
Well, just ring her, innit?

57:36.031 --> 57:36.999
Nah, bro. No way.

57:37.032 --> 57:39.134
What's the worst
that can happen? Just call her.

57:39.568 --> 57:40.869
You serious?

57:42.238 --> 57:43.205
Ring her, bro.

57:43.239 --> 57:45.975
Ah, bruv!

57:46.008 --> 57:47.176
This guy, you know.

57:47.209 --> 57:48.877
- Come on, man.
- This guy!

57:49.278 --> 57:51.313
Bruv, if this girl asked me,
you know.

57:51.347 --> 57:52.982
Ah...

57:59.288 --> 58:00.155
Hello, babe.

58:01.857 --> 58:06.929
Yeah, um, listen. Um, ah, um.
Yeah, I was just gonna ask, um,

58:06.962 --> 58:09.198
if you wanted to go out maybe
to get something to eat later?

58:11.233 --> 58:12.134
Yeah.

58:12.901 --> 58:14.536
Oh, you got an appointment.

58:14.570 --> 58:15.904
What about after?

58:18.107 --> 58:18.941
Seven?

58:18.974 --> 58:21.377
Yeah, okay. Yeah that can work.
Okay.

58:22.311 --> 58:23.212
Yeah.

58:25.281 --> 58:26.181
Okay.

58:26.915 --> 58:27.783
Alright then.

58:28.083 --> 58:28.851
Alright, see you then.

58:31.153 --> 58:33.022
Alright, bye.
Bye-bye, babe. Bye.

58:35.257 --> 58:36.592
Bruv!

58:38.594 --> 58:39.361
Simple.

58:39.395 --> 58:40.863
Wha!

58:40.896 --> 58:43.899
You know the only thing? This girl's
always got appointments though, bro.

58:43.932 --> 58:46.101
Well, she's a woman.
You know what women are like, man.

58:46.135 --> 58:49.071
- Always waxing, do their head, their nails...
- Yeah, true.

58:49.104 --> 58:50.906
- Make sure everything's prim and proper.
- Yeah.

58:50.939 --> 58:52.341
Actually talking about
all that business, man.

58:52.374 --> 58:54.176
I ain't goin' anywhere
in a week or so, innit?

58:54.209 --> 58:55.577
What?

58:55.611 --> 58:57.179
I gotta go and do that whole,
down on one knee thing, you know...

58:57.212 --> 58:58.314
Oh, yeah.

58:58.347 --> 58:59.915
- I forgot about that, you know, bruv.
- Yeah, man.

58:59.948 --> 59:01.150
No, you know,
I'm proud of you, you know.

59:01.183 --> 59:03.052
- You're proud of me?
- Yeah, bruv. I'm proud of you, man.

59:03.085 --> 59:05.321
Trust me, more black guys need
to do the same thing, you know.

59:05.354 --> 59:08.223
You know how many white guys
get married at 17, 18.

59:08.257 --> 59:10.359
Black guys waiting
till they're old, bald,

59:10.392 --> 59:12.361
looking terrible,
belly hanging over their shirt.

59:12.394 --> 59:14.330
Yeah, bruv. Yeah, man.

59:14.363 --> 59:15.597
I'm happy for you, bro.

59:15.631 --> 59:17.966
Is this like some kind
of bromance been going on?

59:18.000 --> 59:21.270
Bro, forget bromance, bro. Take the
"mance" out of it, bro. We're just bros.

59:22.171 --> 59:23.305
- Let's roll, man.
- Come, you ready?

59:23.339 --> 59:24.940
- Yeah, man. Come on, let's roll.
- Let's roll, man.

59:24.973 --> 59:25.874
Let's roll.

59:27.976 --> 59:29.178
That is the one, innit?

59:29.912 --> 59:31.347
I can tell.

59:31.380 --> 59:33.315
You're doing this weird thing
with your eyes

59:33.349 --> 59:34.950
when you're like twitchy
and stuff.

59:34.983 --> 59:36.318
Yeah, I don't know
what you're talking about.

59:36.352 --> 59:38.187
Babe, you haven't done that twitchy
thing since you were at college.

59:38.220 --> 59:39.154
Mmm.

59:39.188 --> 59:40.456
Go on then, there's a picture.

59:41.090 --> 59:42.891
Okay, look at this.

59:47.262 --> 59:49.331
What?
You don't know him, do you?

59:50.099 --> 59:53.102
Babe, he's black, sexy and hot.

59:53.135 --> 59:55.971
No.
My type's white, the odd spawn.

59:56.004 --> 59:57.906
This guy's definitely not
into <i>Dr. Who</i>.

59:59.007 --> 1:00:00.209
I do recognize him though.

1:00:01.276 --> 1:00:02.244
Looks familiar.

1:00:03.312 --> 1:00:04.814
You know,
I got that T'Challa memory, babe.

1:00:04.848 --> 1:00:11.253
- Mm-hmmm.
- Anyway, I think we should arrange an <i>Avengers</i> evening.

1:00:11.286 --> 1:00:12.988
- Yeah?
- I guess that would be fantastic, yeah.

1:00:13.021 --> 1:00:14.623
- Get some noodles.
- Yeah.

1:00:14.656 --> 1:00:17.092
- Get some wine before you leave.
- I'm so down for that. Do you know what I'll do?

1:00:17.126 --> 1:00:19.228
I'll call Jess so we can
have a pamper party. Yeah?

1:00:19.261 --> 1:00:22.664
Okay, brilliant. When do you leave
and does Mr. Man know you're leaving?

1:00:22.698 --> 1:00:24.099
Well, soon-ish.

1:00:24.133 --> 1:00:27.269
You know, but... yeah, it was just,
you know, just dating and stuff.

1:00:27.302 --> 1:00:28.370
- So, it was just sweet.
- Dating?

1:00:28.404 --> 1:00:30.005
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

1:00:30.038 --> 1:00:32.040
- The old eye thing.
- It's all twitchy.

1:00:32.074 --> 1:00:33.242
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

1:00:48.323 --> 1:00:50.325
A hundred and seven messages!

1:00:53.395 --> 1:00:55.164
Who needs online dating?

1:01:07.342 --> 1:01:11.713
So, Marvin, I've got this date
tonight, right?

1:01:13.248 --> 1:01:15.117
And I kind of really like him.

1:01:18.053 --> 1:01:20.355
I don't know what dress to wear.
What dress can I wear?

1:01:20.389 --> 1:01:24.493
I'm thinking of the red one,
or the black one.

1:01:24.526 --> 1:01:28.263
As a matter of fact,
which one do you think?

1:01:29.531 --> 1:01:33.969
This one, or this one?

1:01:37.807 --> 1:01:40.075
But, tonight, listen,
when he comes right,

1:01:40.108 --> 1:01:42.211
you've got to be really
good to him.

1:01:42.244 --> 1:01:43.780
You've got to be a really
good boy, okay?

1:01:43.813 --> 1:01:45.280
Don't jump up on him.

1:01:45.314 --> 1:01:47.549
Don't slobber him with kisses or
anything like that, no hugs, alright?

1:01:47.583 --> 1:01:48.484
Did you get me?

1:01:49.318 --> 1:01:51.286
Okay.
So, you gonna be a good boy?

1:01:52.087 --> 1:01:52.956
You gonna be a good boy?

1:01:52.988 --> 1:01:54.990
You're gonna be a good boy.
Good boy.

1:02:14.510 --> 1:02:15.410
Hello, babe.

1:02:15.845 --> 1:02:17.045
Yeah, I'm outside.

1:02:19.147 --> 1:02:19.949
Okay.

1:02:19.983 --> 1:02:21.383
Alright, see you in a second.
Bye.

1:02:25.587 --> 1:02:27.055
What's going on? What?

1:02:28.156 --> 1:02:29.191
What's going on?

1:02:32.829 --> 1:02:34.162
What the...

1:02:38.835 --> 1:02:40.202
Oh.

1:02:42.504 --> 1:02:45.173
Oh, my Lord! She looks amazing.

1:03:05.227 --> 1:03:06.395
Oh!

1:03:07.629 --> 1:03:09.565
Oh! Are you okay?

1:03:09.598 --> 1:03:13.302
- Ouch! My ankle.
- Oh!

1:03:13.335 --> 1:03:16.471
Ah! They're my favorite shoes.

1:03:17.205 --> 1:03:19.341
I love those. Oh, damn.

1:03:19.374 --> 1:03:21.643
- Is your foot okay?
- No.

1:03:21.677 --> 1:03:23.545
- Thank you.
- Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1:03:23.579 --> 1:03:27.316
Cheers. Aw. Ouch!

1:03:27.349 --> 1:03:31.219
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, I didn't... Ow!

1:03:31.253 --> 1:03:33.856
- Oh, man. Are you sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I'm alright.

1:03:33.890 --> 1:03:36.258
Look, let me go inside
and change this, um...

1:03:36.625 --> 1:03:37.759
- This shoe?
- ...shoe, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:03:37.794 --> 1:03:40.228
What I'll do...
I'm gonna have to call an Uber

1:03:40.262 --> 1:03:41.296
because my car's not working.

1:03:42.464 --> 1:03:43.332
I don't know what's happened to it.
It just stopped.

1:03:43.365 --> 1:03:44.232
Okay.

1:03:44.700 --> 1:03:46.501
Um... Oh, God!

1:03:48.905 --> 1:03:49.571
What?

1:03:49.605 --> 1:03:51.406
It's coming after 43 minutes.

1:03:52.240 --> 1:03:54.209
Like there's thousands of Ubers,
I don't understand.

1:03:54.242 --> 1:03:55.812
Don't worry, don't worry.

1:03:55.845 --> 1:03:59.314
Look, there's a cab station around the
corner, I'll just get us a car, alright?

1:04:00.382 --> 1:04:01.583
Two secs.

1:04:05.520 --> 1:04:07.556
Hi, um, can I have a car,
please?

1:04:08.223 --> 1:04:09.124
Yeah.

1:04:10.525 --> 1:04:11.627
Two hours?

1:04:12.661 --> 1:04:14.663
Right. Okay. Are you sure?
I mean, like I just...

1:04:17.399 --> 1:04:18.533
- What?
- Just put the phone down on me.

1:04:18.935 --> 1:04:20.502
What? Oh, my gosh.

1:04:21.403 --> 1:04:23.572
What a day?
What a week? What a life?

1:04:23.605 --> 1:04:26.208
Do you know, honestly, remember,
I told you I was losing my flat?

1:04:27.242 --> 1:04:29.177
Now I may be losing my job
and then this happens.

1:04:29.211 --> 1:04:30.545
You know what?
Let's just go inside.

1:04:30.579 --> 1:04:32.414
I'll rustle up us
something to eat

1:04:32.447 --> 1:04:36.218
and then we can just watch a film
on Netflix and something, yeah?

1:04:36.251 --> 1:04:37.352
- Should we do that?
- Okay. Alright.

1:04:37.386 --> 1:04:38.921
- Are you sure? Okay, cool.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm sure.

1:04:38.955 --> 1:04:40.622
This hasn't started off
very good, has it?

1:04:40.656 --> 1:04:42.591
No, it hasn't, but it's okay.

1:04:43.325 --> 1:04:44.326
Oh, man.

1:04:45.494 --> 1:04:46.062
- You alright?
- You're gonna have to help me though.

1:04:46.095 --> 1:04:47.295
Alright.

1:04:47.329 --> 1:04:49.665
- Hold on, wait. Where's Marvin?
- He's at my cousin's house.

1:04:50.499 --> 1:04:51.934
Look, don't worry about it.

1:04:51.968 --> 1:04:53.168
We'll just get a takeaway
or something.

1:04:53.535 --> 1:04:55.004
What, you don't trust
my cooking?

1:04:55.038 --> 1:04:57.940
Yeah, I do. I just don't want you to
put too much pressure on your ankle.

1:04:57.974 --> 1:04:59.307
- That's all.
- Oh, thank you.

1:04:59.341 --> 1:05:00.609
I'll tell you what then.

1:05:00.642 --> 1:05:04.947
You order the food and I will
see what's in the television.

1:05:04.981 --> 1:05:06.281
Can you pass me the control,
please?

1:05:06.314 --> 1:05:07.282
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:05:07.315 --> 1:05:08.483
- Ooh.
- There you go.

1:05:08.517 --> 1:05:10.419
Um, just order anything?

1:05:10.452 --> 1:05:13.188
Yeah, but I don't eat seafood
because I'm allergic to it.

1:05:14.456 --> 1:05:15.323
Okay.

1:05:16.391 --> 1:05:17.693
What, like do you come up
in like hives and uh...

1:05:19.327 --> 1:05:20.462
I'm just asking. Alright.

1:05:21.697 --> 1:05:23.498
Are you quite hungry? Shall I get quite a lot?

1:05:23.532 --> 1:05:24.433
Yeah.

1:05:29.404 --> 1:05:32.708
<i>Hello and welcome
to Scottish Rocks.</i>

1:05:32.741 --> 1:05:35.978
<i>This week we will be exploring
one of Scotland's most...</i>

1:05:36.012 --> 1:05:37.446
Do you know what time
he's gonna be back?

1:05:39.015 --> 1:05:40.248
He went on a date, yeah.

1:05:40.615 --> 1:05:42.350
- On a date?
- Mm-hmm.

1:05:42.819 --> 1:05:44.720
He really gets on my nerves,
you know that.

1:05:44.753 --> 1:05:47.322
I had this little shindig
organized for my folks, right?

1:05:47.355 --> 1:05:49.725
Get some people around my ass,
getting set up because he's single.

1:05:49.758 --> 1:05:50.993
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:05:51.027 --> 1:05:53.328
He is the worst.
Never turned up.

1:05:53.361 --> 1:05:54.997
Well, that's what I'm saying.

1:05:55.031 --> 1:05:56.765
I've got him on them apps,
nothing.

1:05:56.799 --> 1:05:58.134
Apps? Oh, my God!

1:05:58.167 --> 1:06:01.303
We sat there one night in my living
room, he was on Grindr, right?

1:06:01.336 --> 1:06:03.505
And I couldn't...
Sorry. No. That's my app.

1:06:03.538 --> 1:06:06.408
He was on Tinder
and we sat there for ages.

1:06:06.441 --> 1:06:08.710
All he kept on doing was swiping
left, right, left, right.

1:06:08.744 --> 1:06:10.345
No matches at all.

1:06:10.378 --> 1:06:12.380
He is the worst person,
honestly.

1:06:12.414 --> 1:06:13.482
Useless, man.

1:06:13.515 --> 1:06:14.583
Honestly.

1:06:17.787 --> 1:06:20.355
What are you doing with that banana?
You're gonna eat it or what?

1:06:22.324 --> 1:06:22.859
Here.

1:06:24.794 --> 1:06:25.694
Thank you.

1:06:28.131 --> 1:06:30.499
Okay. Right. Now, that will be
about 20 minutes.

1:06:31.067 --> 1:06:32.400
What's on Netflix?

1:06:32.434 --> 1:06:34.804
I don't know because this remote
control is just not working.

1:06:34.837 --> 1:06:36.371
- Alright.
- I don't know what's going on.

1:06:36.404 --> 1:06:38.074
Alright. Calm down. Bloody hell.

1:06:38.107 --> 1:06:39.307
Listen, it's alright.

1:06:39.341 --> 1:06:41.777
Listen, we can go old school
like and have a conversation.

1:06:41.811 --> 1:06:42.845
Relax.

1:06:44.046 --> 1:06:47.049
Or, even better if we have
a look at some old photographs.

1:06:47.083 --> 1:06:48.283
That'll be fun.

1:06:49.317 --> 1:06:51.620
What do you mean?
Like an old album and stuff?

1:06:51.653 --> 1:06:53.823
Like of... of me... of my work?

1:06:53.856 --> 1:06:55.524
Of you, obviously.

1:06:55.557 --> 1:06:57.626
Like, you know, the old school
photographs, you know.

1:06:57.659 --> 1:07:00.529
The ones when you had like
your afro and your flares

1:07:00.562 --> 1:07:01.696
and your little picky head
and...

1:07:03.365 --> 1:07:05.400
Those got destroyed years ago
in Haiti.

1:07:05.433 --> 1:07:06.368
Oh, whatever.

1:07:06.401 --> 1:07:07.402
Okay, okay.

1:07:07.435 --> 1:07:08.470
- Alright.
- Mm-hmm.

1:07:09.504 --> 1:07:10.438
Actually, who are they?

1:07:11.306 --> 1:07:14.576
That's my grandparents and...
Yeah.

1:07:14.609 --> 1:07:15.812
Nice. And who's that down there?

1:07:15.845 --> 1:07:18.513
That's my mom
and that's my mom, too.

1:07:19.148 --> 1:07:22.785
Yeah, and that mask there
my dad made that for my...

1:07:22.819 --> 1:07:25.587
Well, for me and my mom
just after she died.

1:07:26.122 --> 1:07:28.623
Oh, very interesting.

1:07:29.125 --> 1:07:30.793
It's different,
I can tell you that.

1:07:30.827 --> 1:07:32.460
Yeah,
my mom was very interesting.

1:07:32.494 --> 1:07:34.897
She was a bit weird, you know. She was
into all that magic stuff and everything.

1:07:34.931 --> 1:07:36.698
Well, like voodoo
and juju business?

1:07:36.731 --> 1:07:38.700
Yeah,
whatever you want to call it.

1:07:39.434 --> 1:07:41.570
Like two days after my 19th
birthday, she passed away

1:07:41.603 --> 1:07:45.540
and yeah, my dad told me that she wrote
a letter, but so slow, he passed away

1:07:45.574 --> 1:07:47.375
before he could tell me where
the actual letter was so...

1:07:47.409 --> 1:07:49.644
Oh, wow. I'm sorry to hear that.

1:07:49.678 --> 1:07:52.414
But anyway, um, do you want something
to drink? What do you fancy?

1:07:52.447 --> 1:07:54.784
Uh, anything really.

1:07:54.817 --> 1:07:58.687
- Whatever you're having. Anything.
- Okay. So, vodka with lemonade?

1:07:58.720 --> 1:08:00.455
- Yeah, that's alright. Yeah, yeah.
- Cool.

1:08:58.781 --> 1:08:59.681
What?

1:09:13.662 --> 1:09:14.696
How long for the food?

1:09:15.898 --> 1:09:17.499
Oh, it should be here
in a minute.

1:09:18.667 --> 1:09:21.436
Should I get that?

1:09:21.804 --> 1:09:24.706
Yeah, go on. Go ahead.
I'm coming. I'm just getting changed.

1:09:31.047 --> 1:09:33.682
- What's this?
- The... the... the... the...

1:09:33.715 --> 1:09:38.687
This... this... this is
just mm... mm... mm... my... my system.

1:09:38.720 --> 1:09:42.825
You're Mr. T Pa...

1:09:42.858 --> 1:09:49.497
This is 65.

1:09:49.531 --> 1:09:51.666
Yeah, but I didn't order pizza.

1:09:51.700 --> 1:09:58.506
But...
you done on... on... on online.

1:09:58.540 --> 1:10:01.543
Bruv, I ordered Thai.
I didn't order pizza.

1:10:01.576 --> 1:10:05.513
But I... I...
I got a d... date. At eight.

1:10:05.547 --> 1:10:07.817
- The... the... the... the...
- Oh, my Lord!

1:10:07.850 --> 1:10:12.654
T... t... tip.

1:10:14.756 --> 1:10:16.993
I know, I did not order pizza.

1:10:17.026 --> 1:10:19.829
It's fine. Let's just eat
because I'm so hungry.

1:10:19.862 --> 1:10:24.632
Oh, and it's seafood.

1:10:25.034 --> 1:10:26.836
- Seafood?
- Yeah.

1:10:27.903 --> 1:10:29.839
- I'm allergic to seafood.
- I know.

1:10:30.705 --> 1:10:31.539
Okay, look.

1:10:31.573 --> 1:10:34.676
Let me get something
from the kitchen.

1:10:34.709 --> 1:10:36.912
Yep, don't worry.

1:10:36.946 --> 1:10:38.781
Alright, can I wash my hands
at least?

1:10:38.814 --> 1:10:40.016
Yeah, sure it's just down there.

1:10:40.049 --> 1:10:41.716
- That door just there.
- Thanks, cheers.

1:10:44.619 --> 1:10:45.520
Alright.

1:10:47.689 --> 1:10:50.793
Oh!

1:10:51.693 --> 1:10:52.761
What happened?

1:10:58.600 --> 1:11:00.870
Oh, my goodness!
Like what else can happen?

1:11:03.939 --> 1:11:05.540
Oh, shit!

1:11:09.711 --> 1:11:10.946
...investing, you're
gonna have to report.

1:11:10.980 --> 1:11:12.915
I know I'm late. You alright?

1:11:12.948 --> 1:11:15.317
You know, busy morning and everything.
How you doing?

1:11:15.351 --> 1:11:17.552
Whatever. Why you always late?

1:11:18.087 --> 1:11:19.355
I just don't get it.

1:11:19.388 --> 1:11:22.958
Stop complaining. I'm here now, okay?
What are you eating?

1:11:23.691 --> 1:11:25.928
- Get your own food.
- Jeez!

1:11:25.961 --> 1:11:28.030
I understand
this woman's prerogative in that

1:11:28.064 --> 1:11:30.866
but there's late
and then there's late.

1:11:30.900 --> 1:11:32.334
What's wrong with you, man?

1:11:32.368 --> 1:11:34.103
Come on like you're not
getting enough bum at home.

1:11:34.136 --> 1:11:37.672
Oh, like really?
Did you really need to even say that?

1:11:37.705 --> 1:11:38.706
Jeez!

1:11:39.741 --> 1:11:41.977
Talking about that, Shen,
how was last night?

1:11:42.845 --> 1:11:44.980
Don't even go there.
Honestly, behave yourself.

1:11:45.014 --> 1:11:47.817
Look, I've just decided that
it's not about me and men, okay?

1:11:47.850 --> 1:11:49.351
It's about me and Marv.
That's it.

1:11:49.385 --> 1:11:50.920
And he's the reason
why you ain't getting no man.

1:11:52.388 --> 1:11:54.656
You see, man, this is exactly the
reason why I can't deal with them.

1:11:54.689 --> 1:11:55.791
Exactly.

1:11:55.825 --> 1:11:58.660
Don't end up one of those like
old biddies, you know.

1:11:58.693 --> 1:12:02.098
All lonely
with your wrinkly cat... or dog.

1:12:02.131 --> 1:12:04.732
Hold on, ain't that...

1:12:06.135 --> 1:12:08.938
- So, I think he...
- Oh, that's Aunty Vanessa.

1:12:08.971 --> 1:12:10.106
Aunty Vanessa, Vanessa.

1:12:10.139 --> 1:12:11.907
- No.
- You got a white auntie?

1:12:11.941 --> 1:12:13.675
She's Jewish for goodness sake.

1:12:13.708 --> 1:12:17.679
Ah, that's like Vanessa
Fitzsimmon always man bashing.

1:12:17.712 --> 1:12:20.116
- Hold on, ain't she like that... like relationship guru?
- Yes.

1:12:20.149 --> 1:12:21.683
Maybe we should speak to her.

1:12:22.151 --> 1:12:22.852
What?

1:12:24.019 --> 1:12:25.955
Like what?
About my man problems?

1:12:26.856 --> 1:12:28.690
- I think you should go to ask her.
- No, no, no.

1:12:28.723 --> 1:12:30.725
- If you won't. I will.
- No.

1:12:30.758 --> 1:12:34.163
No, no, no. No, No. No.

1:12:34.897 --> 1:12:35.998
Um, hi.

1:12:36.031 --> 1:12:37.066
- Hello.
- Excuse me. Hi, Ms. Feltz.

1:12:37.099 --> 1:12:39.034
- Hi.
- Hi, my name is Shaz. Nice to meet you.

1:12:39.068 --> 1:12:41.070
- Nice to meet you.
- This is my friend Shen.

1:12:41.103 --> 1:12:42.238
- Hello.
- Hi there.

1:12:42.271 --> 1:12:43.771
- Hi, pleased to meet you.
- Nice to meet. This is Ben.

1:12:43.806 --> 1:12:45.141
- Hi.
- Hello.

1:12:45.174 --> 1:12:46.175
- Hi, Nice to meet.
- Hi.

1:12:46.208 --> 1:12:47.409
- Hi. Pleased to meet you.
- Hello.

1:12:47.443 --> 1:12:48.743
Nice to meet you.

1:12:48.776 --> 1:12:50.813
Sorry, do you mind
if I get a selfie?

1:12:51.180 --> 1:12:53.782
Sure, pleasure.

1:12:53.816 --> 1:12:55.217
- I'll do it later.
- Alright, fine.

1:12:55.251 --> 1:12:56.986
So, like this is my friend Shen.

1:12:57.019 --> 1:13:00.789
She's basically been single
forever like as in cobweb single.

1:13:00.823 --> 1:13:03.159
- Oh!
- And, um, I know that you guys have been together

1:13:03.192 --> 1:13:04.894
for some time now

1:13:04.927 --> 1:13:08.164
and I just wanted to know if you could give
us some advice on like what the secret is.

1:13:08.797 --> 1:13:09.899
Well, what I would say...

1:13:09.932 --> 1:13:12.067
Well, it's...
it's really very much like this.

1:13:12.101 --> 1:13:14.136
Well,
I think the situation is this.

1:13:14.170 --> 1:13:17.239
What you want is to cultivate
a relationship

1:13:17.273 --> 1:13:18.807
with someone very different
from yourself.

1:13:18.841 --> 1:13:20.075
You've got nothing in common,
whatsoever.

1:13:20.109 --> 1:13:22.444
- Different background, different culture...
- Yeah, but...

1:13:22.478 --> 1:13:25.447
...social class, everything completely
different, income, everything different.

1:13:25.481 --> 1:13:27.049
So, you have nothing
to talk about at all.

1:13:27.082 --> 1:13:28.851
Absolutely nothing 'cause
you got nothing in common.

1:13:28.884 --> 1:13:31.753
Then you rev up
the chemical side

1:13:31.787 --> 1:13:34.190
- and you get that whole carnal side.
- Yeah, but...

1:13:34.223 --> 1:13:37.759
Now, if you unleash,
you know, that element in you

1:13:37.793 --> 1:13:39.795
that may be dormant
for all these years.

1:13:39.828 --> 1:13:42.064
- And so, for example, just for example, randomly...
- Yeah.

1:13:42.097 --> 1:13:43.566
...you're doing something
really ordinary

1:13:43.599 --> 1:13:44.900
- like let's say cleaning your teeth, okay?
- No, but that doesn't always...

1:13:44.934 --> 1:13:47.937
But you have the option
of just cleaning your teeth.

1:13:47.970 --> 1:13:49.071
You're like someone
in a toothpaste ad.

1:13:49.104 --> 1:13:50.639
Okay, so you could be doing it
like this.

1:13:50.673 --> 1:13:55.010
- Yeah, but don't forget...
- No, but you could instead... really, you know.

1:13:55.044 --> 1:13:57.479
You get the toothpaste,
you just squirt it on.

1:13:57.513 --> 1:14:00.082
Kind of like erupt
onto the toothbrush

1:14:00.115 --> 1:14:02.952
and at the moment, you're just,
you know, and it's...

1:14:02.985 --> 1:14:04.353
- Yeah, but what if...
- You squirt the tooth...

1:14:04.386 --> 1:14:06.288
You remember when I did it,
it was only yesterday for God's sake.

1:14:06.322 --> 1:14:07.690
Let's say you're putting on
lipstick.

1:14:07.722 --> 1:14:10.960
You don't just do that, but instead
you, you know, just around there.

1:14:10.993 --> 1:14:15.097
Just like... like that and then that way
you've got this simmering sexual tension

1:14:15.130 --> 1:14:17.266
and you've got the whole thing
going on.

1:14:17.299 --> 1:14:20.502
And, you know, and it can... You can transcend
it into anything you would normally do.

1:14:20.536 --> 1:14:21.971
- Yeah.
- That type of thing.

1:14:22.004 --> 1:14:23.072
So, what do you think, Ben?

1:14:23.806 --> 1:14:24.940
Whatever she said.

1:14:25.908 --> 1:14:26.809
Right.

1:14:32.881 --> 1:14:33.849
Yeah, bruv.

1:14:34.850 --> 1:14:36.552
It's just mad.
I don't know what's going on.

1:14:36.585 --> 1:14:38.821
I swear to you,
it's like I'm cursed.

1:14:39.555 --> 1:14:41.857
It's like... I don't know. I'm serious.
There's something wrong.

1:14:41.890 --> 1:14:44.260
Everything that could have
gone wrong, went wrong.

1:14:44.293 --> 1:14:46.262
<i>What do you mean?
Did you ask her on a date?</i>

1:14:46.895 --> 1:14:48.130
I didn't even get that far.

1:14:48.163 --> 1:14:49.999
That's what I'm trying
to say to you.

1:14:50.032 --> 1:14:52.568
It's... bro,
I don't know what's going on.

1:14:52.601 --> 1:14:55.004
I really don't, man.
It's just crazy.

1:14:55.037 --> 1:14:58.574
I've invited her over later on, so I'm just
hoping that everything goes alright tonight.

1:14:58.607 --> 1:15:01.277
<i>I'm sure it will, bruv.
What about Clara, though?</i>

1:15:01.310 --> 1:15:02.611
<i>When are you gonna see Clara
next?</i>

1:15:02.645 --> 1:15:04.947
Oh, yeah. No, I've got an
appointment with her in a few days.

1:15:04.980 --> 1:15:05.881
<i>Oh, nice. Cool.</i>

1:15:05.914 --> 1:15:07.182
Yeah, so that should be fine.

1:15:07.216 --> 1:15:09.051
- <i>Alright, cool, cool, cool, cool.</i>
- <i>Yeah, okay.</i>

1:15:09.084 --> 1:15:10.085
<i>Yeah, man.
You'll be fine, brother.</i>

1:15:10.119 --> 1:15:11.587
- Yeah, alright.
- <i>You're gonna be good.</i>

1:15:11.620 --> 1:15:13.822
- Bye-bye. Bye.
- <i>Alright, bye.</i>

1:15:16.058 --> 1:15:21.263

1:15:58.200 --> 1:15:59.234
Okay.

1:16:01.070 --> 1:16:02.371
Oh, okay.

1:16:03.172 --> 1:16:04.073
Whoo!

1:16:05.341 --> 1:16:06.942
Me, come on, me.

1:16:12.047 --> 1:16:14.083
No!

1:16:16.051 --> 1:16:17.453
What the hell's going on?

1:16:20.222 --> 1:16:21.323
This is mad.

1:16:49.418 --> 1:16:51.153
Oh, my God!

1:17:02.398 --> 1:17:04.400
- Uh, do you want to take a seat?
- Yeah.

1:17:04.433 --> 1:17:05.300
Alright.

1:17:08.337 --> 1:17:11.006
Oh, my Lord!

1:17:11.039 --> 1:17:12.141
No way.

1:17:14.076 --> 1:17:15.144
Is everything alright?

1:17:17.713 --> 1:17:19.982
Huh? Yeah, everything's fine.

1:17:22.184 --> 1:17:23.318
Oh, my God!

1:17:24.186 --> 1:17:25.154
Oh!

1:17:25.754 --> 1:17:27.055
What's going on?

1:17:28.090 --> 1:17:30.092
Are you sure everything's okay?

1:17:30.125 --> 1:17:34.696
Oh, man!

1:17:34.730 --> 1:17:37.366
Oh, wow! Okay,
so I guess it's takeaway then, yeah?

1:17:37.399 --> 1:17:38.934
And this time, I'm ordering.

1:17:43.272 --> 1:17:46.041
Oh, God! It's so cold out
here, but you know what?

1:17:46.074 --> 1:17:47.476
It's better being out here
than the inside

1:17:47.509 --> 1:17:49.711
with all that smoke
and your three-course meal.

1:17:49.745 --> 1:17:51.980
Funny. Real funny.

1:17:52.014 --> 1:17:54.149
- But it's true, right? Yeah.
- Oh, leave me alone, man.

1:17:54.784 --> 1:17:56.218
- But I'm right.
- Yeah.

1:17:56.752 --> 1:17:58.120
Do you know what?

1:17:58.153 --> 1:18:00.322
I know it sounds weird yeah,
but I just can't believe you're here.

1:18:00.355 --> 1:18:02.191
Like you're actually here
in my house.

1:18:02.558 --> 1:18:05.461
Like, I just feel like
the luckiest guy ever.

1:18:05.494 --> 1:18:06.995
I know it sounds weird.

1:18:07.029 --> 1:18:11.333
I know. I know you think like I'm just
maybe just talking, but I mean it.

1:18:11.366 --> 1:18:13.435
It's... it's just... it's crazy.

1:18:14.369 --> 1:18:16.505
But talking about compliments
and stuff,

1:18:16.538 --> 1:18:19.508
like what do you see
in your ideal woman?

1:18:19.541 --> 1:18:22.110
- My ideal woman?
- Mm-hmm.

1:18:22.144 --> 1:18:25.447
Natural, slick brown hair,
red lipstick,

1:18:25.481 --> 1:18:28.083
- furry coat, black dress, nice teeth.
- Oh, you're funny.

1:18:28.116 --> 1:18:29.351
You're too much.

1:18:29.384 --> 1:18:31.119
You're absolutely too much.

1:18:32.054 --> 1:18:33.222
No.

1:18:33.255 --> 1:18:36.158
I just don't understand
why you're single.

1:18:36.191 --> 1:18:38.193
Like, you're gorgeous.
Look at you.

1:18:40.195 --> 1:18:41.096
Look!

1:18:42.164 --> 1:18:43.398
That moonlight's nice, right?

1:18:45.534 --> 1:18:47.269
Not as beautiful as you.

1:18:49.304 --> 1:18:53.242
Look, this ain't what I had in mind.
I promise you, I can cook.

1:18:54.811 --> 1:18:57.079
No, thanks, no. Uh-uh.

1:18:57.479 --> 1:18:59.581
What, a limp lettuce leaf
is in your finger?

1:19:02.150 --> 1:19:05.087
- I'm sorry.
- It's alright.

1:19:08.825 --> 1:19:11.260
- What about some wine?
- Hmm. Cheers.

1:19:11.293 --> 1:19:14.797
- Alright, cheers. Well, yeah.
- It looks very nice, anyway.

1:19:14.831 --> 1:19:16.799
- Yeah, I did try.
- You did. You did.

1:19:16.833 --> 1:19:18.567
Oh, man! It's bad.

1:19:20.302 --> 1:19:22.805
- Do you dance?
- I do, actually.

1:19:22.839 --> 1:19:24.172
- Can you?
- Yeah.

1:21:52.554 --> 1:21:54.289
Do you have anything
I can change into?

1:21:56.258 --> 1:21:56.793
Huh.

1:21:57.827 --> 1:21:59.628
Yeah, I've got a dressing gown
in the bathroom.

1:21:59.661 --> 1:22:00.562
Thanks.

1:24:05.720 --> 1:24:06.588
Shenisha.

1:24:09.457 --> 1:24:10.358
Shenisha.

1:24:16.598 --> 1:24:20.702
Yo, Ash.
Ash, have you seen Shenisha?

1:24:21.736 --> 1:24:22.571
Huh?

1:24:22.604 --> 1:24:24.606
Been on a bender, mate.
Just got back.

1:24:25.440 --> 1:24:27.576
Bro, do you believe in duppy?

1:24:27.609 --> 1:24:28.510
In what?

1:24:28.878 --> 1:24:30.847
Ghosts, spooks, evil shit.

1:24:30.880 --> 1:24:34.116
You mean like Count Dracula
or Frankenstein?

1:24:34.150 --> 1:24:35.517
Bro, I'm not even joking.

1:24:35.885 --> 1:24:37.419
I think a ghost lives here.

1:24:37.452 --> 1:24:39.922
So, is he more like Casper
or is he Freddy Krueger-ish?

1:24:39.956 --> 1:24:42.457
- I'm serious.
- So am I.

1:24:43.692 --> 1:24:45.460
That shit keeps moving
by itself.

1:24:46.394 --> 1:24:48.898
Look, there's no such thing
as ghosts.

1:24:48.931 --> 1:24:51.566
There's a logical explanation
for everything.

1:24:51.600 --> 1:24:53.501
And on that note,
I'm going back to sleep.

1:24:53.535 --> 1:24:54.603
I've been up all night.

1:24:54.636 --> 1:24:58.373
Logical explanation,
I'm knackered. Later, mate.

1:25:32.942 --> 1:25:34.010
Oh! Come in.

1:25:35.744 --> 1:25:36.879
- Hello.
- Hi.

1:25:36.913 --> 1:25:38.781
- You okay?
- Yeah, it's nice to see you.

1:25:38.814 --> 1:25:40.448
Ah, good.

1:25:40.482 --> 1:25:41.918
So, how are you?

1:25:41.951 --> 1:25:43.718
Yeah, um, not bad.

1:25:43.752 --> 1:25:45.553
Listen, you know the girl
you's talking to outside,

1:25:45.587 --> 1:25:46.956
is that your friend or a client?

1:25:46.989 --> 1:25:48.891
- Phishing, yeah?
- What?

1:25:48.925 --> 1:25:51.894
Phishing, when you're trying
to find that information.

1:25:51.928 --> 1:25:54.997
She's not my friend,
she's a client.

1:25:55.031 --> 1:25:56.464
Client?

1:25:57.833 --> 1:25:59.802
Anyway,
how's your quest for love?

1:25:59.835 --> 1:26:02.805
No, it's alright. Yeah, still single.
Still looking.

1:26:02.838 --> 1:26:07.676
Okay, well, I think today's session
is going to be about role play.

1:26:08.743 --> 1:26:13.682
- Role play?
- Yes, you know, I need you to imagine...

1:26:13.715 --> 1:26:18.720
It's not hard... you know, me,
sexy woman in a club, alright?

1:26:18.753 --> 1:26:21.857
Just a feisty woman in a club.

1:26:21.891 --> 1:26:26.561
I need to see how you would come for
all of this and try to get all of this.

1:26:26.594 --> 1:26:28.264
- I got to do it, really?
- All of this.

1:26:28.297 --> 1:26:31.033
Do you want to stay single, huh?

1:26:32.001 --> 1:26:33.568
- Okay, alright.
- Come for me.

1:26:33.601 --> 1:26:36.038
Alright. Alright.
Alright. Alright.

1:26:36.072 --> 1:26:38.274
Okay. Alright. Ah!

1:26:40.843 --> 1:26:41.877
Oh.

1:27:05.600 --> 1:27:06.869
Oh, God!

1:27:07.837 --> 1:27:09.038
God, I hate packing.

1:27:39.335 --> 1:27:40.069
Shit!

1:28:49.872 --> 1:28:50.840
Hey, Claire.

1:28:51.739 --> 1:28:52.640
Hiya.

1:28:55.044 --> 1:28:59.614
Yeah. Um, look, I need to ask you to
do me a favor, please, if possible.

1:29:00.449 --> 1:29:01.183
Yeah.

1:29:02.551 --> 1:29:06.021
Would you look into a company
called Skyline Properties for me?

1:29:06.956 --> 1:29:07.923
Yeah.

1:29:07.957 --> 1:29:10.226
Yeah, yeah. Skyline Properties.

1:29:12.760 --> 1:29:13.661
Thanks, doll.

1:29:14.964 --> 1:29:16.899
Yeah, bye. Bye.

1:30:47.990 --> 1:30:49.858
Who wants their nails done
first?

1:30:49.892 --> 1:30:51.060
Oh, go on. I'll give it a go.

1:30:51.093 --> 1:30:52.595
Which color do you want?

1:30:52.628 --> 1:30:56.865
I'd go with pink, but you know what
they say, pink makes the boys wink.

1:30:56.899 --> 1:30:58.067
Hey.

1:30:58.100 --> 1:30:59.767
Yeah, yeah. Everyone's here.

1:30:59.802 --> 1:31:00.803
Yeah, what is it?

1:31:02.271 --> 1:31:03.172
What is it?

1:31:04.139 --> 1:31:06.108
Alright. Okay. Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay.

1:31:06.141 --> 1:31:07.876
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Bye.

1:31:08.577 --> 1:31:11.013
- Claire?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's on her way.

1:31:16.385 --> 1:31:19.255
Oh, well. I don't know.
If you ask me, I would say all men cheat.

1:31:19.288 --> 1:31:20.789
- They just can't help it.
- Mm-hmm.

1:31:20.823 --> 1:31:21.857
It's in their makeup.

1:31:23.325 --> 1:31:24.260
If a woman's going to offer them the
pom-pom, they're going to take it.

1:31:26.295 --> 1:31:29.898
Oh, no. Not my Byron.
He's not cheated on me before.

1:31:29.932 --> 1:31:31.333
Not that you know about.

1:31:33.068 --> 1:31:34.336
Piss off!

1:31:35.204 --> 1:31:38.307
So, what's next for the evening,
ladies? What's next?

1:31:38.340 --> 1:31:41.543
- Drinks.
- Yeah, cheers to that. That sounds good.

1:31:41.577 --> 1:31:42.745
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, cheers to that.

1:31:42.777 --> 1:31:46.548
- Chin-chin.
- Mmm, this drink tastes good.

1:31:46.582 --> 1:31:48.117
God, I so needed that.

1:31:57.393 --> 1:31:59.194
- So, what did you find?
- Oh, hi, Claire.

1:31:59.228 --> 1:32:01.997
Yes, I'm fine. Thanks for asking.
Yes, thank you very much. Yes.

1:32:02.031 --> 1:32:03.132
Okay. Hi, how are you doing?

1:32:03.165 --> 1:32:04.166
Okay, so what did you find?

1:32:05.034 --> 1:32:06.135
Where's Marvin?

1:32:06.168 --> 1:32:07.269
He's not here.
He's at my cousin's house.

1:32:07.303 --> 1:32:10.205
- Come on, what did you find?
- Oh, hi, ladies. Alright?

1:32:10.239 --> 1:32:12.207
- Hey, Claire.
- Hiya!

1:32:12.241 --> 1:32:13.575
Nice.

1:32:13.609 --> 1:32:17.112
Okay, you know I said that I
recognized this guy from somewhere.

1:32:17.146 --> 1:32:19.248
- Yeah.
- Boom!

1:32:21.617 --> 1:32:22.951
What is it?

1:32:30.959 --> 1:32:35.331
I knew it would come to me. I went
through all my old albums and I found him.

1:32:35.364 --> 1:32:36.265
Who are they?

1:32:37.801 --> 1:32:40.936
- Oh, you don't want to know, babe. Man, there's more.
- There's more. Shit.

1:32:40.969 --> 1:32:45.607
Well, yeah. So, I did some
digging on your mystery developer

1:32:45.641 --> 1:32:49.144
and he's none other
than Skyline Developers,

1:32:49.178 --> 1:32:51.280
which they've just put in
an application

1:32:51.313 --> 1:32:53.415
to build flats on your gym,
babe.

1:32:54.416 --> 1:32:55.819
What?

1:32:55.851 --> 1:33:01.357
Now, Companies Houses lists Skyline
Developers as Treyvon Patterson,

1:33:01.390 --> 1:33:04.360
and Treyvon Patterson
on LinkedIn's profile

1:33:04.393 --> 1:33:08.097
says that he used to go
to Woodhill College with us.

1:33:08.130 --> 1:33:09.064
You recognize him now?

1:33:10.299 --> 1:33:13.302
Yes, babe. It's Treyvon Patterson, Treyvon.
It's your Trey.

1:33:13.335 --> 1:33:14.903
I hate him.

1:33:14.937 --> 1:33:17.306
What do you mean you hate him? How...
how can you hate him when you just...

1:33:17.339 --> 1:33:19.341
- Oh, shit!
- ...when you used to like him and now... what?

1:33:19.375 --> 1:33:22.177
I mean that's even geeky for me,
Mavis.

1:33:22.211 --> 1:33:23.645
- Mavis?
- Who?

1:33:23.679 --> 1:33:25.381
So, your name's Mavis?

1:33:25.414 --> 1:33:26.648
Can someone tell me
what's going on?

1:33:26.682 --> 1:33:28.650
Oh, shit! Look,
she's having a moment, alright?

1:33:28.684 --> 1:33:32.121
Look. That was then.
This is now, okay?

1:33:32.154 --> 1:33:34.656
Look, you... you... you're stunning.
You're an absolute babe.

1:33:34.690 --> 1:33:35.624
- Ain't she, ladies?
- Yeah.

1:33:35.657 --> 1:33:36.992
- Yes.
- Yeah, you're lovely, Shen.

1:33:37.025 --> 1:33:40.095
No, but it's not what's on the
outside, it's what's on the inside.

1:33:40.129 --> 1:33:41.263
You don't even understand.

1:33:41.296 --> 1:33:43.031
Claire, do you know that
I'm still going to counseling?

1:33:43.499 --> 1:33:44.666
Counseling?

1:33:44.700 --> 1:33:46.935
Would you just please,
just shut up.

1:33:50.439 --> 1:33:53.208
Babe, I'm actually glad that I'm moving because
I don't think I want to see him again.

1:33:53.242 --> 1:33:56.311
This was like 19, 20 years ago,
babe.

1:33:57.112 --> 1:33:58.313
Yeah, he's done wrong,

1:33:59.314 --> 1:34:02.418
but I haven't seen that eye
quiver since you were at college.

1:34:02.451 --> 1:34:04.119
Yeah, she's right.

1:34:05.454 --> 1:34:07.423
What about the gym?
What about those kids?

1:34:08.357 --> 1:34:09.992
Babe, it's just business.

1:34:10.025 --> 1:34:14.163
Look, let's get this <i>Avengers</i>
on the road, okay?

1:34:14.196 --> 1:34:17.132
Because I brought my onesie
and my hammer.

1:34:17.166 --> 1:34:19.034
Bugsy <i>Captain America.</i>

1:34:19.067 --> 1:34:22.371
- Iron Woman.
- Yes... oh, babe. This is my tune.

1:34:22.404 --> 1:34:24.440
Get in. Yes!

1:35:06.081 --> 1:35:08.217
What? What is that?

1:35:08.250 --> 1:35:10.552
Oh, excuse me.
Do you know how to get to Central Park?

1:35:10.586 --> 1:35:12.521
Wait, wait. Hold on. Wait.
Ain't you from here?

1:35:12.554 --> 1:35:15.557
- You trying to get us lost?
- I'm not from here. This is Brooklyn.

1:35:16.358 --> 1:35:18.527
North Train Avenue
is two blocks south.

1:35:18.560 --> 1:35:20.128
Take the C-Train
and you'll find it.

1:35:20.162 --> 1:35:21.463
- C-Train?
- Yeah.

1:35:21.497 --> 1:35:22.397
- Awesome.
- Okay.

1:35:22.431 --> 1:35:23.999
- Thanks.
- Thanks, mate.

1:35:25.234 --> 1:35:27.269
- Cool accent.
- Oh, thanks, bro.

1:35:31.206 --> 1:35:32.774
Oh, God!

1:35:35.377 --> 1:35:38.180
- Do you remember this tree?
- Of course, I remember that tree.

1:35:38.213 --> 1:35:40.048
No, do you remember this tree?

1:35:40.082 --> 1:35:41.350
- Of course, I do.
- Go on then.

1:35:41.383 --> 1:35:44.286
Well, we had our first
picnic here and...

1:35:44.319 --> 1:35:45.554
- Yeah.
- ...we, uh...

1:35:50.392 --> 1:35:52.327
You... you definitely remember
this tree.

1:35:52.361 --> 1:35:56.265
So, alright look, um, we've been
together like three years and...

1:35:56.298 --> 1:35:58.534
- Four.
- Four?

1:35:58.567 --> 1:36:00.402
- Yeah, four. Four years.
- Four?

1:36:00.435 --> 1:36:03.205
We've been together four years,
five months,

1:36:03.238 --> 1:36:05.607
three days
and two and a half hours.

1:36:05.641 --> 1:36:07.309
Wow! Brah.

1:36:07.342 --> 1:36:09.211
Anyway, look,
I've been thinking...

1:36:21.423 --> 1:36:23.158
Really?

1:36:23.860 --> 1:36:25.561
Go on, answer it already.

1:36:27.496 --> 1:36:28.597
Hello.

1:36:28.630 --> 1:36:30.532
Trey. Trey, Trey.

1:36:30.566 --> 1:36:32.467
I'm in the middle of... What?

1:36:32.501 --> 1:36:34.169
Come on, bruv.

1:36:34.202 --> 1:36:36.438
No, I'm just about to do
my down on one knee thing, man.

1:36:36.471 --> 1:36:37.339
What?

1:36:38.707 --> 1:36:40.676
Bro, bro. Just handle your business,
bro, like I'm handling mine.

1:36:41.410 --> 1:36:44.146
No. Bye, Trey. Bye, Trey.

1:36:45.647 --> 1:36:47.316
Sorry.

1:36:47.349 --> 1:36:48.283
Alright, so...

1:36:49.551 --> 1:36:51.219
Oh, my God!

1:36:55.257 --> 1:36:56.391
Will you marry me?

1:36:57.894 --> 1:36:59.328
Yeah, of course.

1:36:59.361 --> 1:37:00.596
- Would you really marry me?
- Yes!

1:37:00.629 --> 1:37:02.497
- Will you marry me, marry me, marry me, marry me?
- Yeah.

1:37:02.531 --> 1:37:03.565
Ai!

1:37:04.433 --> 1:37:05.701
It's just beautiful.

1:37:09.171 --> 1:37:10.606
- We're getting married.
- Yeah!

1:37:52.982 --> 1:37:55.350
<i>Bro, listen.
You need to kiss her, hug her,</i>

1:37:55.384 --> 1:37:56.718
<i>make her feel like
she's the one, bro.</i>

1:37:56.752 --> 1:37:58.253
<i>Trust me, man.</i>

1:37:58.286 --> 1:38:00.288
<i>Do it like your life depended
on it.</i>

1:38:07.562 --> 1:38:10.298
She's the one.

1:38:11.667 --> 1:38:13.602
She's the one.

1:38:13.635 --> 1:38:16.672
She's the one.

1:38:17.606 --> 1:38:18.440
Good morning.

1:38:18.473 --> 1:38:20.342
Mum, what you doing here?

1:38:20.375 --> 1:38:22.411
What? You're not going
to invite us in?

1:38:22.444 --> 1:38:23.712
I need to go.

1:38:23.745 --> 1:38:27.549
This is Myrtle, one of the young
ladies I told you about you.

1:38:27.582 --> 1:38:28.785
The one at the church.

1:38:29.551 --> 1:38:31.553
- Would you like a drink, Myrtle?
- Yes, please.

1:38:31.586 --> 1:38:33.722
She'll have juice.
Any juice will do.

1:38:34.489 --> 1:38:37.626
And I'll have a cup of tea
and in it.

1:38:37.659 --> 1:38:39.327
That's good too.

1:38:42.297 --> 1:38:43.398
Come on, Myrtle.

1:38:54.309 --> 1:38:58.580
"And when he went out, hence..."

1:38:58.613 --> 1:39:00.749
You got the Bible on your phone.

1:39:03.552 --> 1:39:06.488
You do know it's the 21st
century, don't you, son?

1:39:07.756 --> 1:39:10.425
It has to keep up
with the times, you know.

1:39:10.459 --> 1:39:13.729
You can't walk around with
the paper version all the time.

1:39:13.762 --> 1:39:20.635
"...in the synagogue, and many
hearing Him were astonished."

1:39:30.479 --> 1:39:35.517
"Saying from henceforth
this man,

1:39:35.550 --> 1:39:40.655
these things I tell you
the word, powerful."

1:39:41.723 --> 1:39:44.392
Would you like to read
the next chapter, son?

1:39:44.794 --> 1:39:47.763
Oh, do you know what?
I really want to go to the toilet, mom.

1:39:47.797 --> 1:39:48.764
- Toilet?
- Yeah.

1:39:48.798 --> 1:39:50.565
- Now?
- I'm bursting.

1:39:51.100 --> 1:39:53.668
Like I'm...
like my bladder is full.

1:39:53.702 --> 1:39:55.370
Hmm, too much information.

1:39:55.403 --> 1:39:57.372
I'm sorry.
I'll be back in a minute.

1:39:57.405 --> 1:39:59.374
- You have to go now?
- Yeah. I'll be back in a minute.

1:39:59.407 --> 1:40:00.675
My kid.

1:40:04.412 --> 1:40:05.782
He'll soon come back, yeah.

1:40:09.852 --> 1:40:12.287
I think his belly's
a bit delicate.

1:40:13.089 --> 1:40:13.890
Mm-hmm.

1:41:20.156 --> 1:41:21.356
Hey, Shenisha.

1:41:21.958 --> 1:41:23.558
Go away, Treyvon.

1:41:23.926 --> 1:41:25.493
Why? What have I done?

1:41:25.862 --> 1:41:27.129
I just want to talk.

1:41:27.163 --> 1:41:28.831
I've got nothing to say to you.

1:41:29.531 --> 1:41:30.432
What?

1:41:30.833 --> 1:41:32.400
Alright, look. I'm sorry.

1:41:33.768 --> 1:41:35.872
I don't... I don't even know
what I'm saying sorry for.

1:41:35.905 --> 1:41:36.973
Can you open the door?

1:41:39.441 --> 1:41:40.843
Why would you want
to talk to me, anyway?

1:41:41.543 --> 1:41:43.980
What? I'm ugly, remember?

1:41:45.948 --> 1:41:47.649
What are you talking about?

1:41:47.682 --> 1:41:48.951
You're gorgeous.

1:41:49.584 --> 1:41:50.685
I've told you this.

1:41:50.719 --> 1:41:51.954
Just open the door.

1:41:53.990 --> 1:41:55.557
Just open the door.

1:41:56.959 --> 1:41:58.426
Shenisha.

1:42:08.204 --> 1:42:10.538
Why have you got a picture of me
when I was younger?

1:42:17.779 --> 1:42:20.950
And, uh, ugly Mavis?

1:42:21.817 --> 1:42:25.487
Who's this?
Is it... is it your sister?

1:42:25.955 --> 1:42:29.524
- No, it's me, Treyvon.
- What?

1:42:32.560 --> 1:42:34.663
- I don't understand.
- You know what, just delete my number.

1:42:34.696 --> 1:42:36.665
I just don't exist anymore,
alright?

1:42:36.698 --> 1:42:37.967
Just, just go away.

1:42:39.534 --> 1:42:40.602
Shenisha.

1:42:41.904 --> 1:42:42.604
Why?

1:42:43.873 --> 1:42:45.808
The kids, the gym,
just like why.

1:42:46.574 --> 1:42:47.944
Oh, man.

1:42:48.710 --> 1:42:49.678
It's just business.

1:42:49.711 --> 1:42:51.847
I'm a property developer,
that's what I do.

1:42:52.714 --> 1:42:54.850
That gym's been derelict
for decades.

1:42:57.286 --> 1:42:58.720
Just leave me alone.

1:43:29.318 --> 1:43:32.721
Okay, look, can you
just give me five minutes?

1:43:33.956 --> 1:43:37.559
But if you just let me in for five
minutes, I can explain everything.

1:43:38.961 --> 1:43:40.863
Please.

1:44:03.352 --> 1:44:05.021
Hold on. Wait. Where's Marvin?

1:44:05.054 --> 1:44:08.024
Marvin's not here.
If he was here, you'd be minced meat.

1:44:21.703 --> 1:44:23.738
Look, I just want to talk.
Please.

1:44:23.772 --> 1:44:24.940
Talk to me about what?

1:44:26.942 --> 1:44:28.543
So, you can lie to me?

1:44:30.913 --> 1:44:32.714
You know, you ruined my life.

1:44:33.916 --> 1:44:37.319
For all those years, I actually
believed that I was ugly

1:44:37.353 --> 1:44:40.856
and I went to therapy
for years and years and years.

1:44:42.792 --> 1:44:44.927
Yeah, well, look,
you're gorgeous. Look at you.

1:44:44.960 --> 1:44:48.030
No, what you see is strong
and confident on the outside,

1:44:48.064 --> 1:44:50.132
but you have no idea
what's going on in the inside.

1:44:50.166 --> 1:44:52.835
Look, alright.
I know what I could do.

1:44:52.868 --> 1:44:54.736
- What if... hear me out.
- Mm-hmm.

1:44:54.769 --> 1:44:56.671
What if I still serve
the eviction notice.

1:44:56.704 --> 1:44:57.907
Hold on, hold on.
Wait, wait a second.

1:44:57.940 --> 1:45:01.010
- I knock down the building...
- I knew this was a bad idea.

1:45:01.043 --> 1:45:02.278
...build some flats

1:45:02.311 --> 1:45:04.113
- and then put a state-of-the-art gym underneath.
- No, no, no.

1:45:04.146 --> 1:45:05.680
I think you need to leave.

1:45:05.713 --> 1:45:06.816
- Just go.
- But that's alright.

1:45:06.849 --> 1:45:07.917
I said just go.

1:45:10.752 --> 1:45:13.155
Mummy!

1:45:14.857 --> 1:45:17.592
Who keeps their dead mom
in the house?

1:45:20.695 --> 1:45:21.763
What's this?

1:45:25.667 --> 1:45:28.070
"Beauty is in the eye
of the beholder.

1:45:28.104 --> 1:45:32.640
He who caused you pain must
call you gorgeous three times

1:45:32.674 --> 1:45:36.378
<i>or remain without someone
to love or hold,</i>

1:45:36.412 --> 1:45:39.849
<i>without someone
to call their own.</i>

1:45:39.882 --> 1:45:43.651
<i>Six weeks, six days,
six hours will pass.</i>

1:45:43.685 --> 1:45:45.988
<i>The most your love
will ever last</i>

1:45:46.021 --> 1:45:48.891
<i>until the time
true love you see,</i>

1:45:48.924 --> 1:45:52.094
<i>your lonely fate I thus decree."</i>

1:46:17.752 --> 1:46:20.055
- What is...
- Hold on.

1:46:23.058 --> 1:46:24.293
She's talking about me.

1:46:24.326 --> 1:46:27.163
Someone to love. Someone to hold.
Someone to call their own.

1:46:27.196 --> 1:46:28.164
That's me.

1:46:29.031 --> 1:46:31.467
Hold up.
Your mom put juju on me.

1:46:31.500 --> 1:46:32.734
That's it.

1:46:33.735 --> 1:46:38.073
- Oh, Oh, shit.
- Treyvon, this isn't about you.

1:46:38.107 --> 1:46:40.242
No, you're right. It's about us.

1:46:40.276 --> 1:46:43.112
It's about you not letting people
judge you by what you look like

1:46:43.145 --> 1:46:45.747
and understanding that beauty
is in the eye of the beholder.

1:46:46.215 --> 1:46:49.919
And it's about me understanding
that I shouldn't just judge people

1:46:49.952 --> 1:46:51.719
by what they look like
on the outside,

1:46:51.753 --> 1:46:53.122
but what they're like
on the inside.

1:46:54.190 --> 1:46:55.257
That's what it is.

1:46:56.025 --> 1:46:56.992
Can't you see?

1:46:58.961 --> 1:47:01.729
Look, look. Listen,
I'll just do anything to make this work.

1:47:01.763 --> 1:47:03.465
Just... just let me know
what I need to do.

1:47:03.499 --> 1:47:05.901
- I don't... I don't know.
- Forget the flats.

1:47:05.935 --> 1:47:07.970
I'm... I'm not going
to knock down the building.

1:47:08.003 --> 1:47:09.205
I won't bother with that.

1:47:09.238 --> 1:47:10.239
Forget about the flats.

1:47:11.807 --> 1:47:14.843
I'll just refurbish the gym and that's it.
I'll just spend the money there.

1:47:15.544 --> 1:47:17.880
- What, you'd do that for me?
- Yeah.

1:47:17.913 --> 1:47:19.048
No, I'll do it for us.

1:47:20.883 --> 1:47:22.284
What's up with your eye?

1:47:22.318 --> 1:47:23.919
And for her.

1:47:23.953 --> 1:47:25.888
Like, I don't want to go
on the wrong side of her.

1:47:29.858 --> 1:47:31.293
No, no, no, no. Not over mommy.

1:47:48.911 --> 1:47:52.014
Yeah, I know, bro.
It just didn't work out, man.

1:47:53.015 --> 1:47:54.116
I know that's life, mate.

1:47:54.149 --> 1:47:55.784
I thought so, too.

1:47:56.986 --> 1:47:59.021
No, come on, bruv.
Of course, I'm gonna be there.

1:47:59.054 --> 1:48:00.289
I'm the best man
at your wedding.

1:48:01.924 --> 1:48:02.825
Yeah.

1:48:03.826 --> 1:48:04.893
Okay. Alright.

1:48:06.128 --> 1:48:08.364
Alright. Take care.
Alright. Bye.

1:48:13.202 --> 1:48:16.872
- Everything alright?
- Yeah, it is now.

1:48:16.905 --> 1:48:18.440
Mm-hmm.

1:48:18.474 --> 1:48:21.143
Yeah, just Jirese talking about the
finance on that new deal I was doing.

1:48:21.176 --> 1:48:23.279
- Alright. Okay.
- You okay?

1:48:23.312 --> 1:48:24.213
I'm good.

1:48:31.620 --> 1:48:33.022
Ashley!

1:48:33.055 --> 1:48:34.256
Asher!

1:48:34.290 --> 1:48:36.859
- Broski!
- Listen, bro. Quick one.

1:48:41.263 --> 1:48:44.166
Set. Action.

1:48:50.039 --> 1:48:52.107
Sir, we can't hear action at all
out there.

1:48:52.141 --> 1:48:53.042
Action.

1:48:54.443 --> 1:48:58.247
- You'd do that for me?
- Yeah, I'll do it for us. And her.

1:48:58.280 --> 1:49:01.317
What's up with your eye?

1:49:01.350 --> 1:49:04.053
I won't bother building
the flats. How about that?

1:49:04.086 --> 1:49:07.089
I'll just refurbish the gym
and just make it brand-new.

1:49:07.623 --> 1:49:09.325
- You'd do that for me?
- Yeah.

1:49:10.626 --> 1:49:14.196
The eye is incredible.

1:49:18.067 --> 1:49:20.402
Yeah, oh, yeah.

1:49:20.436 --> 1:49:23.972
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. It's broke.

1:49:26.108 --> 1:49:27.309
Let's do it again.

1:49:27.343 --> 1:49:29.078
And for her.

1:49:29.111 --> 1:49:31.180
Like, I don't want to get
on the wrong side of her.

1:49:36.018 --> 1:49:38.120
Oh, you stepped on mom.

1:49:38.987 --> 1:49:42.391
I guess I did.

1:49:46.228 --> 1:49:50.866
Sorry.
