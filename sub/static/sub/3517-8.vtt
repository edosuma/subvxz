02:06.741 --> 02:08.785
Evelyn...

02:08.785 --> 02:11.496
- Mr. Danton.
- Remy.

02:11.496 --> 02:15.333
- How are you?
- I'm OK. I'm good.

02:15.333 --> 02:18.586
- Been awhile.
- Yeah, it has.

02:22.340 --> 02:25.635
- Good morning.
- Mr. Vice President.

02:25.635 --> 02:27.053
Chief Whitehall.

02:27.053 --> 02:29.973
Is Andrew Jackson
going to be joining us?

02:29.973 --> 02:34.227
No, I'm sorry, that's a terrible
oversight. Doug, will you... remove that.

02:34.227 --> 02:36.604
Why don't we take
the photograph first.

02:42.735 --> 02:44.112
Thank you.

02:44.112 --> 02:45.738
Please have a seat.

02:49.993 --> 02:52.287
Let's talk federal recognition.

02:52.370 --> 02:54.706
Your tribe has waited
long enough.

03:27.363 --> 03:28.740
Who is it?

03:28.740 --> 03:31.409
It's me.
It's Lisa.

03:38.207 --> 03:39.959
Can I come in?

03:39.959 --> 03:43.546
Temp jobs, mostly.
Clerical work...

03:43.546 --> 03:47.759
Right now I'm doing part-time
at a dentist's office. Reception.

03:47.759 --> 03:49.552
You deserve better.

03:49.552 --> 03:51.387
It is what it is.

03:51.387 --> 03:55.350
This is the first time I've had
Starbucks since I can remember.

03:55.350 --> 03:58.019
It's a luxury for me these days.

03:58.019 --> 04:01.022
Maybe there's something
for you at Glendon Hill.

04:01.022 --> 04:04.984
That's nice of you to say, but I'm not
the right fit for a place like that.

04:04.984 --> 04:07.654
Sure you are. Twenty years' experience
in the non-profit sphere,

04:07.654 --> 04:10.949
you coordinated all the time
NGOs, you'd be a valuable asset to us.

04:13.242 --> 04:16.536
- Claire should've never let you go.
- Yeah.

04:16.536 --> 04:19.332
Well... I'll hold my tongue.

04:21.750 --> 04:25.171
She and I don't talk.
We had a falling out.

04:25.171 --> 04:27.715
- Loyalty isn't her thing.
- No, it is not.

04:27.715 --> 04:30.134
I don't think
she's loyal to anyone.

04:30.134 --> 04:36.933
- Except maybe her husband.
- Maybe... maybe not.

04:36.933 --> 04:41.187
- What do you mean?
- Nothing I know for certain, but...

04:41.187 --> 04:44.524
...spend a decade
working for someone...

04:49.987 --> 04:52.490
- She threaten you or anything?
- No.

04:52.490 --> 04:54.325
She just wouldn't leave.

04:54.325 --> 04:56.953
It's not like I wanted to call
the cops, she's not a bad person.

04:56.953 --> 04:59.997
- No, no, but...
- I tried to talk to her,

04:59.997 --> 05:02.500
then she lit up a pipe.

05:02.500 --> 05:04.335
- Meth.
- Yeah.

05:04.335 --> 05:06.921
When we were roommates
that's all it was.

05:06.963 --> 05:09.382
I used to be really deep
into that.

05:10.216 --> 05:12.885
Heroin too.

05:12.885 --> 05:16.305
- And then I found the Fellowship.
- What can I do?

05:16.305 --> 05:19.475
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't be here...
- No, I'm glad you came here.

05:19.475 --> 05:21.519
- I know you're late for work.
- I'll call in sick.

05:21.519 --> 05:24.647
- Don't do that, it's not...
- Don't go, stay here.

05:24.647 --> 05:26.941
I mean, don't go back there.

05:28.317 --> 05:30.278
Look...

05:30.278 --> 05:35.116
- Are you sure?
- Keys. In case you need to come and go.

05:35.116 --> 05:38.244
- I'll be back around 7:30.
- Thank you.

05:38.244 --> 05:39.787
You don't have to thank me.

06:04.187 --> 06:07.815
All the president has to do is pick up
the phone and the bridge is approved.

06:07.815 --> 06:10.234
If the president had wanted to be involved,
he would've already made that call.

06:10.234 --> 06:13.529
- It's his initiative, Linda. - Was his
initiative. We're in a trade war now.

06:13.529 --> 06:15.489
That doesn't mean
we have to abandon good policy.

06:15.489 --> 06:17.241
It's inconsistent
with his current stance...

06:17.241 --> 06:19.911
The committee on foreign
investment has 30 days to approve.

06:19.911 --> 06:22.079
There's only six days left.
They won't act without

06:22.079 --> 06:24.248
a directive from the president
of the United States.

06:24.248 --> 06:28.377
I'm confused, you've been the biggest
proponent of our position against China.

06:28.377 --> 06:31.756
That is not true. I advocated
the opposite early on.

06:31.756 --> 06:34.508
You seem fixated on this bridge.
Is something else going on here?

06:34.508 --> 06:37.553
Unemployment is at
nine-point-two, inflation is skyrocketing,

06:37.553 --> 06:39.472
we're on the verge
of losing our majority.

06:39.472 --> 06:41.766
The president needs to offer
a piece of good news.

06:41.766 --> 06:43.976
A bridge? That's a drop
in the bucket.

06:43.976 --> 06:46.562
Jobs, infrastructure,
deficit reduction...

06:46.562 --> 06:48.814
You're still not
being straight with me.

06:48.814 --> 06:50.942
I have no ulterior motive here,

06:50.942 --> 06:54.654
but if you feel that strongly
and the president feels that strongly,

06:54.654 --> 06:58.616
then I'll back off.
I won't mention it again.

06:58.616 --> 07:01.994
I think that's a wise decision.
We should be a united front.

07:02.036 --> 07:05.414
- I couldn't agree more.
- Thank you.

07:05.414 --> 07:07.750
Why does everything
have to be a struggle?

07:07.750 --> 07:11.462
- Can't some people just
say "yes" for once? - Sir.

07:11.462 --> 07:13.881
I need the president's schedule
for the next two days.

07:13.881 --> 07:15.883
- She change her mind?
- What do you think?

07:15.883 --> 07:18.344
- So what's our next move?
- I'll focus on the bridge,

07:18.344 --> 07:20.137
you talk to the Indian affairs.

07:20.137 --> 07:22.556
The sooner that Whitehall's
tribe gets recognized,

07:22.556 --> 07:24.767
the sooner they can
break ground on that casino.

07:24.767 --> 07:26.435
Yes sir.

07:26.435 --> 07:28.479
Maybe it will help me, you know?

07:28.521 --> 07:31.649
If I talk about it
more in the open.

07:31.649 --> 07:34.026
I mean that's what
your interview did.

07:34.026 --> 07:36.988
When I called. When I could
say those things out loud.

07:36.988 --> 07:39.532
Well, we don't want you
to feel obligated.

07:39.532 --> 07:42.451
I know the press
hasn't left you alone.

07:42.451 --> 07:46.789
If they're going to keep taking pictures
of me, I should at least say something.

07:46.789 --> 07:48.582
Well, that's only going
to become more intense

07:48.582 --> 07:50.543
when McGinnis gets closer
to his court-marshal.

07:50.543 --> 07:53.295
Yeah, I know.
I'm prepared.

07:53.295 --> 07:57.007
If you come and speak to the
Armed Services Committee, tell your story,

07:57.007 --> 07:59.176
I feel confident
we can get it to a vote.

07:59.176 --> 08:02.054
- I'd be too much coverage to ignore it.
- And you think it will pass?

08:02.054 --> 08:04.432
- We need to get it through committee
first. - But let's be clear, Megan,

08:04.432 --> 08:06.058
it's not just the testimony.

08:06.058 --> 08:08.477
We'll need you to do
a media avail after.

08:08.477 --> 08:10.479
Photo ops, a statement.

08:10.479 --> 08:12.732
- OK.
- You won't be alone.

08:12.732 --> 08:15.401
- I'll be standing right next to you.
- And so will I.

08:15.901 --> 08:17.987
OK.

08:19.989 --> 08:23.576
Do you think we're doing the right thing?
Hauling her in front of the cameras?

08:23.576 --> 08:27.121
We have to trust her
when she says she wants to.

08:27.121 --> 08:32.835
But it's very important that
the White House backs us
up on this, not just you.

08:32.835 --> 08:36.672
I'm not sure if Garrett
will get involved publicly.

08:36.672 --> 08:38.841
Well, can you talk to him?

08:38.841 --> 08:41.677
We haven't been doing much
talking about anything lately.

08:45.389 --> 08:48.976
Things haven't
gotten any better?

08:48.976 --> 08:52.730
We haven't said a word
to each other in almost a week.

08:52.730 --> 08:55.357
- I've been there, it's awful.
- With Frank?

08:55.357 --> 08:57.651
- Sure.
- What did you do?

08:58.611 --> 09:00.613
We saw someone.

09:00.613 --> 09:04.074
You mean a therapist?

09:04.074 --> 09:07.369
- Weren't you worried about exposure?
- He was a minister.

09:07.369 --> 09:13.417
He wasn't exactly a therapist. It was more
like a spiritual guidance, type thing.

09:13.417 --> 09:15.711
The only difference
was that he had a degree.

09:16.921 --> 09:19.089
I could put you in touch.

09:19.089 --> 09:20.716
It's too risky.

09:22.176 --> 09:24.053
Just a suggestion.

09:24.053 --> 09:25.846
Let me know if
you change your mind.

09:25.846 --> 09:28.432
Thanks.

09:28.432 --> 09:31.393
In the meantime,
can you try to talk to Garrett?

09:31.393 --> 09:33.979
We really need
his support with this.

09:33.979 --> 09:35.522
I will.

09:44.406 --> 09:45.699
Yes?

09:47.409 --> 09:49.161
Show him in please.

10:01.882 --> 10:05.177
- Remy.
- So formal.

10:08.222 --> 10:10.224
Would you have a seat?

10:10.224 --> 10:12.393
Shouldn't keep
your interns so late.

10:12.393 --> 10:14.770
You and I might not
have lives but they do.

10:14.770 --> 10:17.481
When there's work to be done,
we work. They know that.

10:19.316 --> 10:22.861
- Why am I here at ten at night?
- Where's the GOP getting their money?

10:22.861 --> 10:26.865
- That's a $25 million question isn't it?
- You must have an idea.

10:26.865 --> 10:30.160
- What makes you think that?
- Because you know things.

10:30.160 --> 10:33.706
That's why Glendon Hill
made you partner.

10:33.706 --> 10:37.584
Most of our clients are Democrats,
I'm just as much in the dark as you are.

10:38.794 --> 10:40.963
I'm losing in my district, Remy.

10:40.963 --> 10:43.298
I wish I could help you.

10:43.298 --> 10:46.176
Even if I pull off
a win, it doesn't matter.

10:46.176 --> 10:50.305
The GOP takes the house,
I lose my spot in the leadership,

10:50.305 --> 10:52.766
this office, everything
I've worked for.

10:53.726 --> 10:54.768
I feel for you.

10:54.768 --> 10:57.229
But you want information
I don't have.

11:01.275 --> 11:06.780
Are you upset about
the last time we saw each other?

11:06.780 --> 11:10.367
Not at all. I made myself clear.

11:10.409 --> 11:14.538
Can we talk?
No work, no politics.

11:17.916 --> 11:21.587
We can talk about
whatever you want.

11:21.628 --> 11:27.384
I've never... been with anyone
for more than six months.

11:27.384 --> 11:31.638
When I was in the army I was
always on the move and, um...

11:31.638 --> 11:35.267
Since I've been in Congress,
I just haven't had time.

11:35.267 --> 11:40.355
I wasn't asking to marry you.
Just to be more than company for a night.

11:41.565 --> 11:43.192
Do you still want that?

11:44.401 --> 11:45.861
I'm here, aren't I?

11:47.154 --> 11:50.157
There would have
to be clear boundaries.

11:50.157 --> 11:53.702
Whatever we have privately couldn't
affect our professional relationship.

12:00.125 --> 12:03.337
Then we shouldn't be having this
conversation in your office.

12:05.964 --> 12:08.592
I'm glad we had this meeting.

12:08.592 --> 12:12.179
If you'd like to have
another, just call me.

12:12.179 --> 12:14.640
We can leave the
secretaries out of it.

12:27.486 --> 12:29.571
I'll review this
and have Linda get in touch.

12:29.571 --> 12:31.198
Thank you, sir.

12:38.872 --> 12:41.959
- Good morning, Mr. President.
- Hi, Frank.

12:41.959 --> 12:46.672
I left my bourbon at home,
but you have time for some coffee?

12:46.672 --> 12:48.382
I'm fine, you go ahead.

12:52.094 --> 12:54.930
I wanted to talk to you
about the Port Jefferson Bridge.

12:54.930 --> 12:57.015
Linda told me you two spoke.

12:57.015 --> 12:59.059
Have you reconsidered?

12:59.059 --> 13:02.062
It's not the right time, Frank.

13:02.062 --> 13:08.068
We'll find some other project to showcase
our program once tensions subside.

13:08.068 --> 13:10.654
During the campaign,
you repeatedly promised

13:10.654 --> 13:12.531
to address critical
infrastructure.

13:12.531 --> 13:14.825
We're well into
your second year.

13:14.825 --> 13:18.412
This project is ready to go, you don't
want to have to start from square one.

13:18.412 --> 13:20.872
I'm thinking midterms.

13:20.872 --> 13:23.041
We have to project consistency.

13:23.041 --> 13:28.588
Except people don't vote for consistency,
they vote for concrete progress.

13:28.588 --> 13:32.759
Linda mentioned that you seemed
obsessed with this bridge.

13:32.759 --> 13:34.678
I'm beginning to think
she was right.

13:34.678 --> 13:38.181
The backstabbing,
vomit-inducing bitch.

13:38.181 --> 13:40.308
Is she right, Frank?

13:40.308 --> 13:43.478
Tell me why this bridge
is so important to you.

13:45.856 --> 13:48.775
- I wanted to insulate you from this...
- From what?

13:53.822 --> 13:57.617
You asked me to back channel with
the Chinese and I have continued to do so.

13:57.617 --> 14:01.580
No, I told you to stop back
channeling and you did anyway?

14:01.580 --> 14:05.542
- Without informing me, Frank...
- I needed to distance you.

14:05.542 --> 14:08.253
There are issues that
a president cannot be aware of.

14:08.253 --> 14:11.590
- What issues...
- But, what I can tell you...

14:11.590 --> 14:13.717
...is that the building
of this bridge

14:13.717 --> 14:17.304
directly affects our ability to
combat the Republicans in the midterms.

14:17.304 --> 14:19.973
- Have the Chinese...
- Mr. President, you are asking questions

14:19.973 --> 14:23.185
you do not want the answers to.

14:23.185 --> 14:25.479
All right, how much
danger are we in, Frank?

14:25.479 --> 14:28.190
None if we end this
conversation right now.

14:31.318 --> 14:35.030
Sometimes I feel like I'm losing control
over my goddamn administration.

14:35.030 --> 14:38.033
You're under pressure, sir,
but you're not losing control.

14:38.033 --> 14:43.121
You have people who are
looking out for you: me, Linda, your wife.

14:43.121 --> 14:45.373
I might be losing control
of her too.

14:46.792 --> 14:49.419
I shouldn't have said that...

14:49.419 --> 14:53.173
Of course she wants
the best for me.

14:53.173 --> 14:56.468
Has Claire said anything?
I know they talk.

14:56.510 --> 15:00.806
Not much... just that things
have been a little rocky.

15:00.806 --> 15:04.601
Well, that's an understatement.

15:04.601 --> 15:10.315
You have the most difficult job on earth.
It would take a toll on any marriage.

15:10.315 --> 15:14.319
Which is why I'm urging you
to reconsider your decision on the bridge.

15:14.319 --> 15:19.783
And I'd say that not as
your vice president... but as your friend.

15:19.783 --> 15:21.993
Because I care about you.

15:30.377 --> 15:32.921
All right, I'll...
I'll have another look at it.

15:34.130 --> 15:36.216
Thank you, Mr...

15:38.760 --> 15:40.554
Thank you, Garrett.

15:42.806 --> 15:47.310
- Mr. Frost.
- Morning.

15:47.310 --> 15:49.980
We filed all our paperwork
back in 2006.

15:49.980 --> 15:52.399
We dotted all of our I's
and crossed all of our T's.

15:52.399 --> 15:56.611
There's over 317 applications. Each one
requires at least a year to review.

15:56.611 --> 15:59.072
- You need more researchers.
- It's not just personnel.

15:59.072 --> 16:01.908
There's travel, filing,
administration...

16:01.908 --> 16:04.160
Name the figure.

16:04.160 --> 16:06.246
Twelve, thirteen million.

16:06.246 --> 16:08.373
That requires an appropriation
from Congress.

16:08.373 --> 16:10.000
The vice president
can make that happen.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.877
But first we need you
to recognize the Ugaya tribe.

16:12.877 --> 16:16.965
Our policy is first come, first serve.
There are other applications which we...

16:16.965 --> 16:19.384
Daniel Lanagin disenrolled us.

16:19.384 --> 16:22.387
We lost our right
to BIA benefits.

16:22.387 --> 16:23.805
Is this more about
starting a casino?

16:23.805 --> 16:25.724
It's about correcting
an injustice.

16:25.724 --> 16:28.018
I can't be getting involved
in inner-tribal conflicts.

16:28.018 --> 16:30.937
Yes, you can.
If you want that appropriation.

16:33.189 --> 16:35.900
Two months. Maybe less
if all the ancestry holds up.

16:35.900 --> 16:38.028
Lanagin knows.

16:38.028 --> 16:39.404
And what did he say?

16:39.404 --> 16:43.241
He wants to meet.
But on his turf this time.

16:43.241 --> 16:46.703
I need a way to get to Missouri
without attracting any attention.

16:46.703 --> 16:49.956
Womack's district is in Kansas City.
It's not far from the casino.

16:49.956 --> 16:53.293
See if he has any events
coming up: rallies fund-raisers...

16:57.964 --> 17:00.592
How's it coming with
cosponsors for Claire's bill?

17:00.592 --> 17:03.428
Terrific, we're making
great progress.

17:10.810 --> 17:13.688
One speech, it'll send a message to
Congress...

17:13.688 --> 17:15.732
And a message to
the joint chiefs that I'm trampling on...

17:15.732 --> 17:18.777
Twenty-four thousand assaults
last year, only 3,000 reported because...

17:18.777 --> 17:20.819
- I know the figures.
- Do you know how many suicides

17:20.819 --> 17:23.615
- result from the trauma...
- It's not the question of statistics...

17:23.615 --> 17:25.784
- This bill will save lives.
- Can we discuss this later?

17:25.784 --> 17:28.578
- I had to schedule this meeting, Garrett.
- It's the middle of the day.

17:28.578 --> 17:32.332
- You know very well...
- Don't make me lobby you when I go home...

17:32.332 --> 17:35.251
I'm sorry to interrupt Mr. President.
The secretary general's here.

17:35.251 --> 17:36.753
I got two more minutes.

17:36.753 --> 17:39.339
It's 12:30, he was schedule
for 12:15.

17:39.798 --> 17:40.924
I'll go.

17:44.511 --> 17:46.846
You were supposed to
tell me to stay.

17:46.846 --> 17:49.474
But it's nice to know
I'm worth at least two minutes.

17:57.607 --> 18:00.443
Hi, Tricia.

18:00.443 --> 18:02.821
No, please,
don't worry about it.

18:07.909 --> 18:09.911
Oh, that's awful.

18:11.287 --> 18:14.582
Yes, of course, let me
grab his number for you.

18:16.084 --> 18:17.502
Mm-hm.

18:21.548 --> 18:23.049
Right.

18:26.803 --> 18:29.472
His name is Dr. Thomas Larkin.

18:29.472 --> 18:35.019
At 202-251-6258

18:35.019 --> 18:37.438
And if you'd like, I can
give him a call before hand

18:37.438 --> 18:39.566
and let him know
you'll be reaching out.

18:42.277 --> 18:45.029
OK, you let me know
if I can be of any help.

18:46.364 --> 18:48.283
Good night, Tricia.

18:50.034 --> 18:51.744
What do you think?

18:51.744 --> 18:53.621
We'll see.

18:55.248 --> 19:00.503
The idea is to take color theory
and turn it on its head.

19:00.503 --> 19:02.589
Break all the rules.

19:03.881 --> 19:06.509
They're gorgeous.

19:06.509 --> 19:08.803
Who'd you say your client is?

19:08.803 --> 19:10.305
I didn't.

19:10.305 --> 19:12.265
I was just wondering
if maybe I knew them.

19:12.265 --> 19:14.058
You don't.

19:14.100 --> 19:17.145
Let's say he's a collector
always on the lookout for new talent.

19:19.105 --> 19:22.108
I understand you work
for Adam Galloway.

19:22.108 --> 19:25.903
Yeah... it's a way
to pay the bills.

19:25.903 --> 19:29.324
I mean, Adam's a good photographer
if you like that kind of thing.

19:29.324 --> 19:32.076
I'm much more
interested in form.

19:32.076 --> 19:36.372
- How much for all of them?
- What?

19:36.372 --> 19:41.085
I'd like to buy them all.

19:41.085 --> 19:44.047
<i>Missouri is the</i>
<i>"Show Me State" for a reason.</i>

19:44.047 --> 19:49.052
<i>We need to show the rest of America
that we can keep our leadership intact.</i>

19:49.052 --> 19:52.805
It is a pleasure to look out
and see a room full of smiling faces.

19:52.805 --> 19:55.767
That's not something you see
everyday in Washington DC.

19:55.767 --> 19:58.394
- What did your editor say?
<i>- Five thousand words.</i>

19:58.394 --> 19:59.604
This should be twice that.

19:59.604 --> 20:00.897
I could probably
get them to eight,

20:00.897 --> 20:02.774
but I'm gonna need
the First Lady too.

20:02.774 --> 20:03.900
Separate interviews.

20:03.900 --> 20:05.985
Let me talk to Mrs. Underwood.

20:05.985 --> 20:07.904
<i>How come you're coming to me</i>
<i>with this instead of Connor?</i>

20:07.904 --> 20:10.907
Between you and me, he's out.
He got a job at SpaceX.

20:10.907 --> 20:12.992
<i>His choice or was he pushed out?</i>

20:12.992 --> 20:15.703
People don't like working with me, Matt.
You may be the only one.

20:15.703 --> 20:18.456
I don't like you either. I might
if you give me the First Lady.

20:18.456 --> 20:20.249
They'll both be speaking
to armed services tomorrow.

20:20.249 --> 20:21.542
<i>Along with Megan Hennessy.</i>

20:21.542 --> 20:23.169
<i>She's</i> the one the general...

20:23.169 --> 20:24.337
That's right.
I'll set up a one-on-one,

20:24.337 --> 20:25.880
text you for your piece.

20:25.880 --> 20:27.173
All right, let me know, man.

20:27.173 --> 20:28.674
Anything for the <i> Times,</i> man.

20:28.674 --> 20:30.551
Anything for the <i> Times,</i> huh?

20:30.551 --> 20:33.137
Then we get shut out
of donor meetings.

20:33.137 --> 20:35.098
The magazine. And yes.

20:35.098 --> 20:38.101
Raymond Tusk. Your boss
went to see him last October.

20:38.101 --> 20:40.603
It's in his congressional
travel report.

20:40.645 --> 20:42.939
- Before my time.
- You said they didn't communicate.

20:42.939 --> 20:44.899
- I said, "not to my knowledge."
- We're in Missouri.

20:44.899 --> 20:47.777
- He's not one of the donors.
- I can quote you on that?

20:47.777 --> 20:50.029
If you spell my name right.

20:50.029 --> 20:54.033
Now, normally, I don't quote
Northern writers, but every now and then

20:54.033 --> 20:56.077
one of them says something
that makes a lot of sense,

20:56.077 --> 20:59.580
and this Emerson fellow
you probably heard of,

20:59.580 --> 21:04.252
once wrote that the only way
to have a friend is to be one.

21:04.252 --> 21:08.631
I think you all know what kind of
a friend Terry has been to this district.

21:08.631 --> 21:12.343
So I am proud to introduce him
today and to call him my friend.

21:12.343 --> 21:16.722
Would you please welcome, the majority
leader, Representative Terry Womack.

21:16.722 --> 21:18.558
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

21:24.188 --> 21:26.232
We all set?

21:26.232 --> 21:30.361
I told the press you were having some
private meetings with contributors.

21:30.361 --> 21:35.032
- Any protests?
- We're good except for Ayala Sayyad.

21:36.409 --> 21:38.035
Thank you. What's going on?

21:38.035 --> 21:41.080
- Potential blind spot.
- Tell me on the way to the car.

22:12.862 --> 22:15.197
Mr. Vice President.

22:15.197 --> 22:16.490
Thank you.

22:23.664 --> 22:26.459
Calm down. Now.

22:27.793 --> 22:30.212
Welcome.

22:30.212 --> 22:34.383
- What a pleasant surprise, Raymond.
- Mr. Vice President.

22:34.383 --> 22:37.553
I was expecting to see you
privately today, Daniel.

22:37.553 --> 22:41.307
When it's a serious matter
I invite all the chiefs to the circle.

22:44.185 --> 22:46.062
Nice pool.

22:46.062 --> 22:49.315
I've never swum in
it. The chlorine hurts my eyes.

22:49.315 --> 22:52.318
You're welcome to take
a dip in it if you'd like.

22:52.318 --> 22:54.904
Another time.

22:54.904 --> 22:57.490
Raymond tells me
you're a ribs man.

22:57.490 --> 22:59.909
I've got three of the
choicest pieces of meat

22:59.909 --> 23:04.080
you'll ever see in your life coming out.
You do not want to pass on this.

23:04.080 --> 23:06.123
I won't be here long.

23:06.123 --> 23:09.418
So the Ugaya band.

23:10.503 --> 23:12.880
Tip of the iceberg.

23:12.880 --> 23:15.966
- They're not a real tribe.
- They're about to be.

23:15.966 --> 23:20.554
No, they're a bunch of troublemakers
with too much hope on their hands.

23:20.554 --> 23:24.058
Once they get recognized,
they're gonna have their own casino.

23:24.058 --> 23:25.601
In two years... at best?

23:25.601 --> 23:28.020
You better enjoy this pool
while you can.

23:28.020 --> 23:31.065
I don't think your casino
can stand that sort of competition.

23:33.317 --> 23:37.780
Who do you think Whitehall
called as soon as he left the BIA?

23:37.780 --> 23:42.493
You offer them a casino two years from
now, we offered what they really want.

23:42.493 --> 23:46.288
Reenrollment in my tribe.

23:46.288 --> 23:49.416
A tip of your iceberg
is melting, Frank.

23:49.416 --> 23:54.713
And you do not have time
on your side so how about this...?

23:54.713 --> 23:58.551
You help me repair
my relationship with Garrett,

23:58.551 --> 24:02.847
Dan and I here get the money
flowing back in the right direction.

24:06.308 --> 24:07.977
How about this...?

24:07.977 --> 24:11.021
I get the BIA to investigate
both of you.

24:11.021 --> 24:13.274
Connection to Feng, laundering...

24:13.274 --> 24:15.734
You could, but you won't.

24:15.734 --> 24:17.486
You don't dare.

24:17.528 --> 24:20.406
My money has been going
to the Democrats for nine years.

24:20.406 --> 24:22.616
You were the whip
for all of them.

24:22.616 --> 24:24.285
You implicate us,
you implicate yourself.

24:24.285 --> 24:27.538
And everyone in the leadership.

24:27.538 --> 24:29.957
- Ah, here comes the steak.
- Oh...

24:29.957 --> 24:33.377
Now you are going to enjoy this,
Frank. There you go.

24:33.377 --> 24:35.462
Thank you.

24:35.462 --> 24:38.507
Now dig in, Frank.
Before the flies get to it.

24:38.507 --> 24:40.968
- I'll pass, thanks.
- Are you sure?

24:40.968 --> 24:44.305
This is soy-fed Matsusaka beef.

24:44.305 --> 24:48.642
You know, my ancestors would've
prayed to this heifer to honor her spirit.

24:48.642 --> 24:53.188
But at 200 bucks a pound,
I figure... fuck tradition.

24:53.188 --> 24:55.524
Come on, live a little, Frank.

24:56.859 --> 24:59.236
Mr. Vice President.

24:59.236 --> 25:01.822
Not my vice president.

25:01.822 --> 25:04.283
You're on sovereign land.

25:16.629 --> 25:19.423
Dogs are so predictable,
aren't they?

25:24.470 --> 25:28.015
Set up a meeting with Walker. Tonight,
if possible. I should be back by six.

25:28.015 --> 25:30.225
- <i> Lanagin didn't budge?</i>
- He reenrolled the Ugaya.

25:30.225 --> 25:33.103
<i>- We have to get the bridge approved now.</i>
<i>- </i> I'll call Linda.

25:33.103 --> 25:35.773
<i>Bypass her, I don't</i>
<i>want her in the meeting.</i>

25:35.773 --> 25:38.317
- I'm on it.
- Thanks.

25:38.317 --> 25:42.863
Meechum, get in touch with the plane
have them make ribs for the flight back.

25:42.863 --> 25:43.947
Yes sir.

27:14.705 --> 27:16.540
Mr. Vice President,
do you have a moment?

27:16.540 --> 27:18.041
I'm sorry, the president
asked to see me.

27:18.041 --> 27:21.128
No he didn't, you requested the meeting
and I took it off the schedule.

27:21.128 --> 27:23.755
- You did what?
- Let's go in your office.

27:25.883 --> 27:29.344
You lied, Frank. You said
you would let the bridge go

27:29.344 --> 27:31.680
and then you went behind my back
just like you're trying to do now.

27:31.680 --> 27:34.391
- I do not require your permission!
- No, but you should involve me.

27:34.391 --> 27:37.519
The president and the vice president
have issues they must discuss privately.

27:37.519 --> 27:40.480
When you are secretive it prevents
me from being able to do my job.

27:40.480 --> 27:43.775
And when you cancel meetings it
prevents me from being able to do mine.

27:43.775 --> 27:45.903
Which is why I wanted to talk
so we can work things out.

27:45.903 --> 27:47.738
- I will not waste my time...
- We should be working together...

27:47.738 --> 27:49.239
...inflating your sense
of self-importance!

27:49.239 --> 27:52.034
- Excuse me?
- How many elections have you won?!

27:52.034 --> 27:54.536
How many congressional
committees have you chaired?!

27:54.536 --> 27:56.163
Would you even be working
in the White House

27:56.163 --> 27:58.123
if I hadn't recommended you
during the campaign?

27:58.123 --> 28:01.585
I returned that favor and then
some. Look where your desk is now!

28:01.585 --> 28:03.003
And I'd say we're even.

28:03.003 --> 28:04.963
And if you want
to maintain my respect,

28:04.963 --> 28:06.548
you're going about it all wrong.

28:06.548 --> 28:08.133
I asked you in here
to work out a situation...

28:08.133 --> 28:09.635
You didn't ask, you demanded!

28:09.635 --> 28:11.053
I will not be left out
of the loop,

28:11.053 --> 28:12.930
I'm the president's
chief of staff.

28:12.930 --> 28:17.309
You call this being chief of staff?
Micromanaging his date book?

28:17.309 --> 28:19.811
I'd say that's more
of a glorified scheduler.

28:19.811 --> 28:22.564
The White House would fall off
its rails without me doing my job.

28:22.564 --> 28:24.524
- Are you certain about that?
- Yes, I am.

28:24.524 --> 28:26.985
I look out
for the president 24/7.

28:26.985 --> 28:29.780
I keep him informed.
I keep his priorities straight.

28:29.780 --> 28:32.032
We did just fine before you
became vice president, Frank.

28:32.032 --> 28:34.117
All right, let's go over
to the Oval Office right now

28:34.117 --> 28:37.371
and ask the president to choose:
his chief of staff or his vice president.

28:37.371 --> 28:39.998
I know what the answer would be.
You wanna go?

28:41.208 --> 28:42.960
I didn't think so.

28:42.960 --> 28:47.839
Now I will see the president
tomorrow morning, schedule or no.

28:49.299 --> 28:53.053
And please, turn out the lights
before you leave.

28:58.350 --> 29:00.143
I thought you went home.

29:00.143 --> 29:04.022
No, not yet.
Um, do you have a moment?

29:04.022 --> 29:05.732
Is there something wrong?

29:05.732 --> 29:08.777
I know you are reconsidering
the bridge project and I want...

29:08.777 --> 29:10.696
I'm reviewing it.
I'll make my decision soon.

29:10.696 --> 29:12.781
But you already
made a decision, sir.

29:12.781 --> 29:15.283
I'm concerned that you
are overthinking this one.

29:15.283 --> 29:17.494
- If we backtrack...
- Did I not make myself clear?

29:17.494 --> 29:19.871
I'm just trying to offer
my advice, sir.

29:19.871 --> 29:24.543
Which I've heard. And which I don't
need to hear again but... thank you.

29:24.543 --> 29:27.879
I know the vice president spoke
to you yesterday and in fairness...

29:27.879 --> 29:30.090
You know I value your input,
Linda,

29:30.090 --> 29:32.634
but when I say I've heard it,
you need to know I mean that.

29:32.634 --> 29:34.136
Of course, sir.

29:34.136 --> 29:37.347
- Is there anything else?
- No, sir.

29:37.347 --> 29:39.724
- Good night.
- Good night.

29:50.318 --> 29:51.987
You disappointed me.

29:51.987 --> 29:54.072
I told you it would take time.

29:54.072 --> 29:55.407
Any leads?

29:55.407 --> 29:57.701
I've been going over
his state senate days,

29:57.701 --> 29:59.286
it's a slow process.

29:59.286 --> 30:00.704
I have to be thorough.

30:00.704 --> 30:02.539
So how is it that
I've found more in two days

30:02.539 --> 30:04.124
than you have in two months?

30:04.124 --> 30:07.878
- What do you mean?
- I've had to do your job for you.

30:07.878 --> 30:09.379
You found something?

30:09.379 --> 30:11.923
I'm the one who's supposed
to ask that question.

30:11.923 --> 30:14.468
What'd you find?
Maybe I can help.

30:16.595 --> 30:18.513
Are you working for Frank?

30:18.513 --> 30:23.768
- Yeah, as his communications director.
- No, are you working for him?

30:23.768 --> 30:25.437
Come on.

30:25.437 --> 30:27.439
He couldn't pay me a fraction
of what you're offering.

30:27.439 --> 30:30.901
- Don't lie to me. - Look, if you've lost
confidence in my ability...

30:30.901 --> 30:32.068
Stop fucking around.

30:36.865 --> 30:38.909
You made the wrong choice, Seth.

30:39.951 --> 30:41.661
I don't think so.

30:43.872 --> 30:46.750
You're nothing.
You're a parasite.

30:46.750 --> 30:50.170
So are you Danton.
Just in a nicer suit.

30:56.843 --> 30:58.678
Do you know what it might be?

31:01.890 --> 31:03.767
Well, keep your ear
to the ground.

31:07.312 --> 31:08.855
That was Seth.

31:13.443 --> 31:16.404
He thinks Remy may have
something on us.

31:18.865 --> 31:23.495
- What?
- He doesn't know.

31:23.495 --> 31:27.040
- Do you think it could be...
- No.

31:27.040 --> 31:31.836
If it's anything I'm sure it's innocuous.
Nothing we can't weather.

31:31.836 --> 31:35.924
But my bet is they're bluffing.
Just to make us paranoid.

31:38.843 --> 31:42.681
But he's a dangerous man,
isn't he? Raymond?

31:44.307 --> 31:46.685
We can be dangerous too.

31:46.685 --> 31:48.269
When we need to be.

32:33.606 --> 32:35.316
Don't stop.

32:38.987 --> 32:40.989
I used to be a call girl.

32:44.617 --> 32:48.621
I had to get away from it
and that's why I came here.

32:54.753 --> 32:56.921
It's a lot of stuff
you don't know about me.

32:56.921 --> 32:59.424
You don't have to
say anything you don't want to.

33:05.513 --> 33:08.224
When you tapped on
my shoulder on the bus,

33:08.224 --> 33:10.643
there was something...

33:17.442 --> 33:19.736
Your eyes.

33:19.736 --> 33:22.530
- That sounds really, really dumb.
- No.

33:24.574 --> 33:26.659
Um...

33:26.659 --> 33:30.580
I don't know, I felt like...
I wanted to tell you everything.

33:31.372 --> 33:33.208
Like...

33:33.208 --> 33:36.669
...that I could trust you
even though I didn't know you.

33:36.669 --> 33:37.837
You can.

33:42.050 --> 33:44.302
I never trusted anyone.

33:45.678 --> 33:47.805
Have you ever loved anyone?

33:52.769 --> 33:54.312
No.

33:57.774 --> 34:02.111
I've never expected
much from the world. It's ugly.

34:02.111 --> 34:04.072
It's not a fair place.

34:06.157 --> 34:08.117
I'm happy to have what I have.

34:10.828 --> 34:12.914
I'm glad I have this.

34:45.279 --> 34:47.239
I've thought it all out.

34:47.239 --> 34:50.827
And there's a way to do it
so we don't risk any exposure.

34:52.245 --> 34:54.371
Do we have to talk
about this now?

34:55.623 --> 34:57.625
I'm beat.

34:57.625 --> 34:59.460
My brain is f...

35:01.462 --> 35:03.047
Yes, we do.

35:04.757 --> 35:07.051
Because it's our marriage.

35:07.051 --> 35:11.389
If we're going to survive
the next two years... or six.

35:12.348 --> 35:14.642
We need to do something.

35:14.642 --> 35:17.645
We should be each others'
support system.

35:17.645 --> 35:21.357
Not cause each other stress.

35:21.357 --> 35:24.777
The foundation of this White
House is not brick and mortar.

35:24.777 --> 35:26.821
It's us, Garrett.

35:31.659 --> 35:34.036
This is important to me.

35:34.036 --> 35:36.456
And I want it
to be important to you.

35:42.670 --> 35:44.922
I have to trust
that whatever you're managing,

35:44.922 --> 35:48.843
to whatever extent you choose
not to inform me, that I'm neither at risk,

35:48.885 --> 35:51.637
nor passively condoning
something blatantly illegal.

35:51.637 --> 35:53.514
Any risk solely falls on me,

35:53.514 --> 35:56.559
and you can't be accused of condoning
what you're not aware of.

35:56.559 --> 35:58.728
Being not aware,
is just as egregious.

35:58.728 --> 36:02.523
Not in this case. I'm steering the
ship away from the rocks, not toward them.

36:02.523 --> 36:04.609
Then I'll call the committee
for foreign investments.

36:04.609 --> 36:06.736
You're making
the right decision, sir.

36:08.237 --> 36:10.656
I have another difficult
decision to make.

36:11.991 --> 36:15.536
Linda submitted her resignation.

36:15.536 --> 36:20.208
I was furious with her. That was
a very manipulative move.

36:20.208 --> 36:22.668
I can speculate
as to why she made it.

36:22.668 --> 36:25.338
Are her complaints valid?

36:25.338 --> 36:28.132
I have a very biased view
on that subject.

36:28.132 --> 36:30.885
Well, I've heard hers.
Give me yours.

36:32.136 --> 36:34.472
Linda and I don't always agree.

36:34.472 --> 36:38.226
But she's been very loyal to you,
and a more than competent chief of staff.

36:38.226 --> 36:40.102
So you think I should keep her?

36:42.063 --> 36:45.316
Do I think she oversteps
sometimes? Yes.

36:45.316 --> 36:48.569
Does she wrongly equate
her advice with mine? Often.

36:48.569 --> 36:52.740
But... the question that occurs
to me is not about Linda.

36:52.740 --> 36:57.537
Let's say you refuse her resignation,
if this gets out, and it could,

36:57.537 --> 37:02.166
won't you be sending a signal
to anybody who works for you that...

37:02.166 --> 37:05.628
...you can be leveraged.

37:05.628 --> 37:10.174
She offered her resignation.
She's already gone even if she stays.

37:23.229 --> 37:25.773
Megan. They're ready.

37:25.773 --> 37:28.567
I don't know,
my hands are shaking.

37:28.567 --> 37:31.195
You can do this, Megan.
I'll be there.

37:31.195 --> 37:33.990
I get panic attacks sometimes.

37:33.990 --> 37:36.117
- You're afraid you'll get one?
- Yeah.

37:36.117 --> 37:39.537
OK, why don't we ask for a couple
more minutes, that's not a problem.

37:39.537 --> 37:41.914
It's not about that,
they just come.

37:41.914 --> 37:44.041
I can't control them.

37:46.252 --> 37:48.170
I don't want to do this.

37:50.673 --> 37:55.094
OK, Megan, there's some of the most
senior congressmen and women in the room,

37:55.136 --> 37:57.221
and they press, they've shown up
just to hear from you.

37:57.221 --> 37:59.890
- I know.
- OK, I don't want to pressure you,

37:59.890 --> 38:03.144
but a lot of planning
has gone into this.

38:04.270 --> 38:06.188
Please don't make me do this.

38:07.940 --> 38:10.026
We're not making you
do anything.

38:10.026 --> 38:12.194
Then can I just go back home?
Back to Chicago?

38:12.194 --> 38:13.946
Listen, you have nerves,
that's understandable.

38:13.946 --> 38:15.573
I don't wanna fucking do it, OK?

38:15.573 --> 38:17.575
I understand, it's OK. But
if you back out now, Megan...

38:17.575 --> 38:19.493
- This isn't about me at all, is it?
- ...this is not good for us.

38:19.493 --> 38:21.662
It hurts us, it makes us
look unorganized.

38:21.662 --> 38:23.080
This is about your
fucking moment to shine.

38:23.080 --> 38:24.665
You don't care if do...

38:24.665 --> 38:27.710
I do care. I do care.

38:27.752 --> 38:30.796
It is about me and about you!

38:33.841 --> 38:38.345
And for whatever reason, we both
decided to share what happened to us.

38:38.345 --> 38:40.014
And it mattered
and people listened

38:40.014 --> 38:41.724
so let's go in
and finish what we started.

38:41.724 --> 38:43.559
- I can't, I'm not the right person.
- Come on, Megan.

38:43.559 --> 38:46.228
You know what I did last night?
I picked up some guy at a bar.

38:46.228 --> 38:49.774
A total stranger. I let him
fuck my brains out at the hotel.

38:49.774 --> 38:51.400
Night before, same thing.

38:51.400 --> 38:53.402
I can't stop.
It's my only way to fucking...

38:53.402 --> 38:56.322
Jesus, I fucking hate this when
my hands shake like this and I...

39:02.536 --> 39:05.331
It's OK.
It's OK.

39:05.331 --> 39:06.999
I'm not who you want
to be your poster girl.

39:06.999 --> 39:09.210
It's OK. You don't have to be.
You don't have to be.

39:09.210 --> 39:10.503
I'm sorry I'm letting you down.

39:10.503 --> 39:12.338
It's OK, you're not
letting me down.

39:12.338 --> 39:14.298
It's OK. It's OK.

39:14.298 --> 39:16.091
When will it become official?

39:16.091 --> 39:17.927
<i>President will make</i>
<i>his call this afternoon.</i>

39:17.927 --> 39:21.180
<i>Official approval will be</i>
<i>announced in the morning.</i>

39:21.180 --> 39:23.224
No revisions to the agreement?

39:23.224 --> 39:26.977
<i>None. Everything is</i>
<i>as spelled out in the proposal.</i>

39:26.977 --> 39:29.688
Then I will uphold
my end of the bargain.

39:29.688 --> 39:31.357
<i>The money will be cut off.</i>

39:31.357 --> 39:34.610
You required proof.
Now we want some.

39:34.610 --> 39:37.363
- <i> What sort?</i>
- Of your commitment.

39:37.363 --> 39:39.281
You kill your
co-venture with Tusk.

39:39.281 --> 39:41.951
<i>- </i> That was never part of the deal.
<i>- It is now.</i>

39:41.951 --> 39:45.246
<i>The refinery can't proceed</i>
<i>while we're in a trade wall.</i>

39:45.246 --> 39:49.250
We want you to kill it for good.
And we want you to kill it today.

39:49.250 --> 39:51.126
Make the call to Tusk.

40:05.891 --> 40:08.227
<i>It's business hours,</i>
<i>is this a business call?</i>

40:08.227 --> 40:09.812
No...

40:09.812 --> 40:11.897
<i>I was hoping it wasn't.</i>

40:11.897 --> 40:14.733
- What are you doing tonight?
- Just about to get on a plane.

40:14.733 --> 40:16.235
<i>Where to?</i>

40:16.235 --> 40:18.362
Boundaries, remember?

40:18.362 --> 40:21.115
- Work related.
- <i> I don't take vacation.</i>

40:22.575 --> 40:24.785
Can you tell me
when you'll be back?

40:24.785 --> 40:27.246
Tomorrow. It's a quick trip.

40:27.246 --> 40:28.831
<i>Do you want to have dinner?</i>

40:29.790 --> 40:31.333
I'd like that.

40:31.333 --> 40:36.005
Bring your carry-on.
You can stay over after.

40:44.013 --> 40:47.182
- Yes.
- Do you have a moment?

40:47.182 --> 40:48.934
Absolutely.

40:48.934 --> 40:52.146
The president accepted
my resignation an hour ago.

40:52.146 --> 40:53.814
Yes, I know.

40:53.814 --> 40:55.649
I almost told him
that I changed my mind,

40:55.649 --> 40:57.401
but I realized
it wouldn't make any difference.

40:57.401 --> 40:59.820
For whatever it's worth,
I did bring up your loyalty

40:59.820 --> 41:03.032
and how good you are at your job.
Not that he needed me to remind him.

41:03.032 --> 41:05.826
And I will always be grateful
you recommended me.

41:05.826 --> 41:07.619
It has been quite a ride.

41:07.619 --> 41:09.872
Shorter than I would've hoped,
but I have a long career ahead.

41:09.872 --> 41:12.499
- No doubt.
- And just so you know,

41:12.499 --> 41:14.793
I don't plan on making
any fuss in the press.

41:14.793 --> 41:18.005
You'll hear nothing but
my praises if I'm asked.

41:18.005 --> 41:20.966
I have something for you.
A few weeks ago,

41:20.966 --> 41:23.802
the president told me about
a dinner he had at your house.

41:23.802 --> 41:26.430
He went on and on
about your Civil War models.

41:26.430 --> 41:29.016
How much fun he had painting
the toy soldiers with you.

41:29.016 --> 41:32.519
This was given to me by the
director of the Smithsonian.

41:32.519 --> 41:36.106
It's the first Medal of Honor
awarded to a Hispanic-American:

41:36.106 --> 41:39.568
Corporal Joseph de Castro,
he fought for the Union.

41:41.487 --> 41:44.948
Linda, I don't know what to say.

41:44.948 --> 41:48.702
It's clear the president sees you
as a friend, I've never been that to him,

41:48.702 --> 41:51.955
but his job is bigger
than friendship.

41:51.955 --> 41:54.208
It's bigger than you and me.

41:54.208 --> 41:57.836
I just hope you'll look out for
him the way I've tried to do.

41:57.836 --> 42:01.006
I will. And I'll treasure this.

42:02.508 --> 42:05.260
Goodbye, Mr. Vice President.

42:12.059 --> 42:15.771
I've never thought higher of her
than I do at this moment.

42:15.771 --> 42:21.777
She lost...
but she played to win.

42:21.777 --> 42:26.281
Underwood got the phone.
The refinery's dead. Grayson played us.

42:26.281 --> 42:28.116
We're running out of options.

42:30.494 --> 42:32.162
What do you think Jean?

42:33.872 --> 42:35.332
Fuck him!

42:36.959 --> 42:38.335
Do it.

42:59.439 --> 43:00.983
Thank you.

43:15.372 --> 43:17.708
Thank you for doing this Sandra.

43:20.377 --> 43:21.712
Richard.

43:26.049 --> 43:27.509
How are you, Richard?

43:27.509 --> 43:30.971
He has his good days
and his bad.

43:30.971 --> 43:32.723
This is a good day.

43:32.723 --> 43:34.975
He'd love to spend a few minutes
with you after your meeting.

43:34.975 --> 43:36.059
Of course.

43:36.059 --> 43:37.769
The reverend's in here.

43:40.063 --> 43:42.983
- Mrs. Walker.
- Hello.

43:42.983 --> 43:45.611
- Mr. President.
- Reverend.

43:52.326 --> 43:54.536
How can I help?

43:54.536 --> 43:57.122
You need to get
a fan in here, Francis.

43:57.122 --> 43:59.499
Well, the AC is all the way
up to full blast.

43:59.499 --> 44:01.918
I mean from the fumes, the glue.

44:01.918 --> 44:04.504
Oh, that's half the fun.

44:09.426 --> 44:12.304
Megan Hennessy
bailed on us today.

44:13.430 --> 44:14.681
Why?

44:14.681 --> 44:16.600
Her nerves got to her.

44:16.600 --> 44:20.395
And she decided she didn't
want to be in the public eye.

44:20.395 --> 44:23.690

sympathize with that.

44:23.690 --> 44:25.901
That was Doug.

44:25.901 --> 44:27.486
Yes.

44:30.489 --> 44:32.741
Seth.

44:32.741 --> 44:34.076
I'll call you back.

44:34.076 --> 44:35.285
When?

44:47.339 --> 47:06.019
