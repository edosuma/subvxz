02:30.840 --> 02:32.960
SOCO need another hour.

02:32.960 --> 02:34.520
She's been placed like that.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.440
Carefully placed.

02:47.920 --> 02:49.440
Do we have a name?

03:44.520 --> 03:46.160
Mrs Thomas?

03:47.760 --> 03:49.240
Gwen?

04:13.760 --> 04:15.320
When did you see Alys last?

04:18.800 --> 04:20.720
A couple of days ago.
Is that normal?

04:24.000 --> 04:26.240
We speak on the phone sometimes,
but...

04:29.360 --> 04:32.640
..we haven't been that close
just recently.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.240
Any particular reason?

04:37.080 --> 04:39.360
There was an argument. About what?

04:41.720 --> 04:43.080
I don't remember.

04:45.520 --> 04:48.880
She's impulsive. Like her dad.

04:50.320 --> 04:51.720
Is he here?

04:53.560 --> 04:55.920
Can we talk to him?

04:55.920 --> 04:58.160
My husband and I haven't spoken
in months.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.800
I have no idea where he is.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.520
Alys Thomas.

06:04.520 --> 06:07.120
Classics undergraduate,
was studying in Aber.

06:07.120 --> 06:10.360
Pathology think she'd been dead for
8-10 hours before she was found.

06:10.360 --> 06:12.840
That puts time of death between
ten and 12 last night.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.120
What else have we got?

06:14.120 --> 06:16.800
Bruising to the face consistent
with a blow or a fall.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.000
No signs of sexual assault.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.640
We're waiting for the medical
examiner's report to confirm.

06:20.640 --> 06:22.320
What about her shoes, her mobile?

06:22.320 --> 06:23.880
Missing. No sign.

06:23.880 --> 06:25.400
I want them found.

06:25.400 --> 06:27.080
Alys was dressed to impress.

06:27.080 --> 06:29.200
She was taking care
of the way she looked.

06:29.200 --> 06:31.520
Was that for her own benefit,
or somebody else's?

06:31.520 --> 06:32.800
What about the tattoo?

06:32.800 --> 06:36.960
A Celtic symbol of female power,
sir. Triskele.

06:36.960 --> 06:38.280
It's got other meanings, too.

06:38.280 --> 06:40.200
Could be religious,
could be lots of things.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.800
What about her parents?

06:41.800 --> 06:45.120
Gwen and Iwan Thomas married young.
1989.

06:45.120 --> 06:47.320
Gwen was 18, Iwan 21.

06:47.320 --> 06:49.280
They separated in 2004.

06:49.280 --> 06:52.080
But they were never divorced.
What do we know about the father?

06:52.080 --> 06:53.760
He was one of us.

06:53.760 --> 06:56.320
A police officer?
What happened to him?

06:56.320 --> 06:59.240
We had to let him go.
The man liked his drink.

06:59.240 --> 07:01.880
Did you know about this?
Let's find out where he lives.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.120
House on the estate, sir.
We've already checked.

07:04.120 --> 07:06.280
There's no sign of him.
He hasn't been seen for days.

07:06.280 --> 07:08.280
Well, let's find out where he works.
Yes, sir.

07:08.280 --> 07:10.280
I want a picture
of how the dead girl lived.

07:10.280 --> 07:12.560
Who she knew
and what she believed in.

07:12.560 --> 07:15.120
Whoever did this
felt something for her.

07:15.120 --> 07:18.200
She wasn't dumped, she was placed.

07:18.200 --> 07:19.960
It was a conscious act.

07:19.960 --> 07:21.720
And I want to know why.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.040
I don't think
I ever spoke to Iwan Thomas.

07:28.040 --> 07:30.640
I was still in uniform back then.

07:30.640 --> 07:32.120
But you know what happened?

07:32.120 --> 07:33.800
Rumour has it he wasn't up to it.

07:35.520 --> 07:39.360
I've found where Iwan Thomas works,
sir. I'll check him out.

08:13.280 --> 08:14.840
What about friends?

08:14.840 --> 08:17.480
She doesn't have any really.

08:17.480 --> 08:19.240
Only Sara.

08:20.520 --> 08:22.240
Sara Perkins.

08:23.320 --> 08:26.080
They study together, classics.

08:26.080 --> 08:28.720
They've been close for years.
Still are.

08:32.480 --> 08:34.919
Did Alys have any plans last night?

08:34.919 --> 08:37.760
Was she due to meet someone,
go somewhere?

08:37.760 --> 08:42.520
Did Alys come home in the evenings?
Generally, I mean.

08:42.520 --> 08:46.600
No. No, she's got a flat in town.

08:46.600 --> 08:49.360
She shares it with Sara.
We'll need an address.

08:51.280 --> 08:54.320
Could you think of anyone that
would want to hurt your daughter?

08:57.280 --> 09:01.000
What's her relationship
with her father like?

09:01.000 --> 09:03.080
I don't know.

09:05.360 --> 09:06.880
They used to be close.

09:40.760 --> 09:42.600
Sara Perkins?

09:45.240 --> 09:47.160
You were friends, weren't you,
you and Alys?

09:49.560 --> 09:51.880
We've known each other
since primary school.

09:51.880 --> 09:54.000
You must've been through
a lot together.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.480
Did Alys have a boyfriend?

09:58.480 --> 10:00.120
Alys didn't like to get involved.

10:00.120 --> 10:01.360
Why not?

10:04.520 --> 10:07.080
You don't seem to know much
about your friend, do you?

10:08.840 --> 10:10.920
Don't you care?

10:10.920 --> 10:12.440
Of course I care.

10:13.600 --> 10:16.080
Lately, I'm not sure she cared much
about me, though.

10:17.800 --> 10:19.480
Alys changed.

10:19.480 --> 10:22.080
The last few months, she was...

10:23.440 --> 10:25.080
..she was different.

10:25.080 --> 10:26.720
We need to see her room.

11:26.040 --> 11:27.760
Odi et amo.

11:30.480 --> 11:32.080
I hate and I love.

11:42.720 --> 11:44.600
I hate and I love.

11:44.600 --> 11:47.080
Who does she hate?
Who does she love?

12:00.480 --> 12:04.240
Catullus 85. Odi et amo.

12:04.240 --> 12:06.520
"I hate and I love.

12:06.520 --> 12:09.360
"Why, you may ask? I know not,

12:09.360 --> 12:13.160
"but I feel it happening"
and I am tormented.

12:13.160 --> 12:15.160
She was really taken by it.

12:17.560 --> 12:19.520
She was so full of life.

12:19.520 --> 12:21.480
When did you see Alys last?

12:21.480 --> 12:23.120
Yesterday. When?

12:23.120 --> 12:24.680
Morning, in my lecture.

12:24.680 --> 12:27.360
What kind of a student was she?
Bright.

12:29.080 --> 12:32.400
But she suffered the usual problems
one associates with growing up.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.160
In what way?

12:34.160 --> 12:37.520
Hm! Alys felt things intensely.

12:37.520 --> 12:41.400
She was unique. She didn't just
study it, she lived it.

12:41.400 --> 12:43.880
She had character.

12:43.880 --> 12:45.400
She was bright.

12:45.400 --> 12:47.280
There was no place for mediocrity.

12:48.600 --> 12:50.840
She was a creative soul.

12:52.280 --> 12:54.800
But recently she'd lost her way
and, er...

12:54.800 --> 12:57.160
Well, it happens.

12:57.160 --> 12:59.640
Were you concerned about her?

12:59.640 --> 13:03.080
Well, she was fragile.
There was a darkness in her.

13:04.240 --> 13:06.360
And there was something
going on at home.

13:08.240 --> 13:10.280
It was a difficult time for her.

13:10.280 --> 13:12.360
We need to speak with her father.

13:13.480 --> 13:15.760
Well, I can't help you there.
I'm sorry.

13:24.680 --> 13:28.200
This is Alys at 17:22
yesterday afternoon,

13:28.200 --> 13:30.000
arriving at Aberystwyth station

13:30.000 --> 13:33.280
wearing the same dress,
carrying a small bag.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.040
She was dressed up for something.

13:35.040 --> 13:37.640
For a man? Not necessarily.

13:38.720 --> 13:41.120
Now, this is an angle from inside
the station.

13:41.120 --> 13:44.560
She's catching the 17:30
heading east to Shrewsbury.

13:54.840 --> 13:58.920
I checked CCTV all along the route.
She didn't go very far.

14:00.360 --> 14:03.520
Ten minutes later,
she got off at Borth station.

14:08.080 --> 14:11.920
Now, if we scroll forward
to 22:55...

14:13.560 --> 14:17.320
..the next train to Aberystwyth
is due at 23:25.

14:17.320 --> 14:18.600
What's she looking for?

14:18.600 --> 14:21.360
Her phone. It has to be.

14:23.600 --> 14:26.640
She was dead within an hour.
Where did she go?

14:33.920 --> 14:37.200
Let's get up there. And I want every
inch of that platform searched.

15:23.680 --> 15:24.960
Can I help you?

15:26.640 --> 15:27.920
Yeah.

15:28.960 --> 15:30.560
And you are?

15:30.560 --> 15:33.320
Dyfan. Dyfan Richard.

15:33.320 --> 15:36.960
I live at the station house.
Look after the museum.

15:36.960 --> 15:38.360
Is there a problem?

15:39.720 --> 15:41.880
Do you work here? I help out.

15:41.880 --> 15:44.800
Keep an eye on the place.
Keep everything in order.

15:46.120 --> 15:48.000
Do you know this girl, Mr Richard?

15:51.160 --> 15:53.360
She was found dead on the marshes
this morning.

16:18.440 --> 16:19.880
I used to see her quite often.

16:21.600 --> 16:24.800
She was pleasant.
Different to the others.

16:24.800 --> 16:26.920
The others?

16:26.920 --> 16:28.640
Most of the people on the platform.

16:28.640 --> 16:30.640
There was a way about her.

16:33.440 --> 16:34.720
Always full of life.

16:36.240 --> 16:37.440
Ready with a smile.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.480
When did you last see her?
I'm not sure.

16:51.480 --> 16:53.440
A few weeks ago?

16:53.440 --> 16:56.440
I only spoke to her a couple
of times. That's all.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.280
Such a pretty girl.

17:00.640 --> 17:04.000
Bachman City Class. 3439.

17:05.839 --> 17:09.200
My brother Ian, he was a fanatic.

17:09.200 --> 17:10.599
Does he still collect?

17:15.359 --> 17:18.000
What did you and the girl
speak about, Mr Richard?

17:18.000 --> 17:19.359
I don't recall.

17:20.760 --> 17:24.040
She was headed over to the hotel.

17:24.040 --> 17:26.200
The Rhediol hotel?

17:26.200 --> 17:27.440
Yes. That's the one.

17:28.480 --> 17:31.320
Where were you last night?

17:31.320 --> 17:33.760
Here. Home alone.

17:33.760 --> 17:36.040
And you saw nothing? Heard nothing?

17:37.400 --> 17:39.840
No. Nothing.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.560
She was here last night,
about six-ish.

18:03.560 --> 18:05.200
With a man.

18:05.200 --> 18:07.080
Can you describe the man?

18:07.080 --> 18:10.240
I didn't get a look at him.
But you remember the girl?

18:10.240 --> 18:12.960
She's not the sort of girl
you'd forget.

18:12.960 --> 18:15.400
Been here a few times. A few times?

18:15.400 --> 18:17.920
And you say you never saw
the man's face?

18:17.920 --> 18:20.600
Oh, I'm not really sure
if it was the same man.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.640
You heard them together?
Only rowing.

18:23.640 --> 18:27.440
Shouting and screaming, she was,
slamming doors.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.080
The whole shebang.

18:29.080 --> 18:32.120
You should've seen the room
afterwards. A right state.

18:32.120 --> 18:34.440
Did they leave anything behind?
A bag, shoes?

18:35.480 --> 18:36.840
How did they pay?

18:36.840 --> 18:39.320
Cash. They left it on here.
What time was this?

18:39.320 --> 18:42.280
10:30? What about the room?
Has it been cleaned?

18:42.280 --> 18:46.200
Yes, but, er...you can have a look,
if you like.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.000
Thanks.

19:38.040 --> 19:39.840
'Alys?'

19:39.840 --> 19:41.440
Who is this?

20:06.160 --> 20:07.640
Ever decreasing circles.

20:10.240 --> 20:12.200
Why were you calling her? No reason.

20:12.200 --> 20:13.760
How do you know her?

20:13.760 --> 20:15.720
I used to see her round.
You were her dealer?

20:17.080 --> 20:20.920
We went to a few parties last summer,
hooked up a couple of times.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.560
Had a few laughs. No big deal.

20:22.560 --> 20:25.280
She was wild
with a couple of drinks inside her.

20:25.280 --> 20:26.840
When did you last see her?

20:27.960 --> 20:29.680
I don't remember. Try.

20:29.680 --> 20:31.840
A week? Two?
Where were you last night?

20:31.840 --> 20:34.160
Here till closing time.
What time was that?

20:34.160 --> 20:36.280
Midnight-ish.
What about after closing time?

20:36.280 --> 20:37.720
I went home with someone.

20:37.720 --> 20:41.000
Who? Oh, does it matter?
Is that how you got your black eye?

20:42.720 --> 20:45.040
Alys' father did it. Iwan Thomas.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.120
That's why I was phoning her.

20:49.120 --> 20:51.120
To warn her he was off his head
on booze.

20:51.120 --> 20:53.760
He gets me outside,
tells me to leave Alys alone.

20:53.760 --> 20:57.040
I try to tell him I got nothing
to do with Alys any more,
and he smacks me.

20:57.040 --> 20:59.040
When was this? Sunday night.

20:59.040 --> 21:01.800
Why did you wait so long
before phoning Alys?

21:01.800 --> 21:04.960
I'd been phoning and phoning.
I know, I checked the phone records.

21:04.960 --> 21:07.600
I was trying to warn her.
I was looking out for her.

21:09.600 --> 21:12.600
Iwan's not a man you want to cross.
Why hire him?

21:12.600 --> 21:15.640
Knows the patch.
He's all right when he's sober.

21:15.640 --> 21:18.160
And when he isn't?
You stay out of his way.

21:18.160 --> 21:21.160
Terrible what happened, though.

21:21.160 --> 21:22.880
Did you ever meet his daughter Alys?

21:22.880 --> 21:25.080
The man never shut up about her.

21:25.080 --> 21:26.920
This him? Yeah.

21:26.920 --> 21:28.480
You think he'd hurt her?

21:28.480 --> 21:31.320
He drove taxis for me.
I don't want to get involved.

21:39.880 --> 21:42.160
I want a unit outside
Iwan Thomas' house.

21:42.160 --> 21:45.320
Yes, sir. There's something else.
What is it?

21:45.320 --> 21:47.400
A postmortem has been completed.

21:47.400 --> 21:52.120
There's evidence of multiple
scarring on Alys' inner thigh.

21:52.120 --> 21:54.000
Recently? It doesn't appear so.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.240
You coming in? No.

22:35.200 --> 22:38.280
Mami? Gwen?

23:12.920 --> 23:14.280
He was a great dad.

23:15.600 --> 23:17.320
She adored him.

23:20.960 --> 23:22.280
What happened?

23:23.360 --> 23:26.120
There's no room for us
in his life any more.

23:26.120 --> 23:28.840
He said the job needed him.

23:28.840 --> 23:30.960
More than usual?

23:30.960 --> 23:34.240
There was a case.
It...got under his skin.

23:35.800 --> 23:37.240
Drink was a release.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.360
So they suspended him.

23:44.480 --> 23:46.080
What happened?

23:46.080 --> 23:49.400
They pulled him over. One of his own.

23:49.400 --> 23:51.080
Did him for drink-driving.

23:53.080 --> 23:54.440
Part of me was relieved.

23:55.920 --> 23:57.680
I thought we'd get the old Iwan back.

23:59.640 --> 24:01.160
But he was more distant than ever.

24:02.760 --> 24:04.080
Even with Alys?

24:07.840 --> 24:08.960
Could he have harmed her?

24:10.080 --> 24:11.480
Sober?

24:13.200 --> 24:14.560
Never.

24:15.840 --> 24:17.800
Any idea where we might find him?

24:40.360 --> 24:42.480
I know this is difficult for you,
Gwen.

24:46.120 --> 24:48.560
But there's evidence
of scarring on Alys' body.

24:49.840 --> 24:53.720
Was she...was she self-harming?

24:53.720 --> 24:55.600
It was something we knew about.

24:57.240 --> 24:58.520
We dealt with it.

24:59.760 --> 25:01.200
It passed.

25:01.200 --> 25:04.280
He should never have said
those things.

25:04.280 --> 25:06.200
What things?

25:06.200 --> 25:09.640
My husband and I had an argument
a couple of years ago.

25:11.200 --> 25:12.760
Some things were said.

25:15.040 --> 25:17.040
Not all of them were meant, and...

25:18.800 --> 25:20.320
..Alys overheard.

25:21.320 --> 25:23.200
Overheard what?

25:24.360 --> 25:27.760
The usual drunken rant
about how I never forgave him

25:27.760 --> 25:30.760
for never being able to give me
a baby of my own.

25:30.760 --> 25:34.560
How he was the reason
I had to settle for...

25:36.160 --> 25:37.920
..second best.

25:37.920 --> 25:39.560
Alys was adopted?

25:42.920 --> 25:45.200
And was there any truth
in what your husband said?

25:51.000 --> 25:52.200
No.

25:56.480 --> 25:58.240
I loved my daughter.

26:19.040 --> 26:20.640
Alys?

26:24.240 --> 26:25.600
Yes.

26:35.240 --> 26:36.760
Where did you find it?

26:39.160 --> 26:41.200
Rheidol Hotel in Borth.

26:42.280 --> 26:43.840
What was she doing there?

26:43.840 --> 26:46.000
That's what we're
trying to find out.

27:03.720 --> 27:06.720
She's dead...because of us!

27:06.720 --> 27:10.040
We killed her, you and me!
Our own daughter!

27:10.040 --> 27:12.120
This is between me and her!

27:12.120 --> 27:14.280
Iwan, stop it! Our daughter!

27:14.280 --> 27:18.720
Our own daughter!

28:21.080 --> 28:22.200
Hiya.

28:23.360 --> 28:24.680
Hiya.

29:47.360 --> 29:50.320
There's another meaning, sir.
The triskele design.

29:50.320 --> 29:52.120
Mother, father, child.

29:55.160 --> 29:56.600
I hate and I love.

29:58.400 --> 30:00.760
The two people she loved the most.

30:02.160 --> 30:03.960
The two people that let her down.

31:34.640 --> 31:36.120
Stop!

32:14.000 --> 32:15.320
Oi!

32:50.080 --> 32:51.680
How do you feel?

32:54.080 --> 32:55.480
I've felt better.

32:58.560 --> 32:59.840
Take your time.

33:02.440 --> 33:04.040
There's no rush.

33:12.800 --> 33:13.960
Do you have children?

33:22.760 --> 33:23.840
You?

33:25.280 --> 33:26.760
No.

33:28.120 --> 33:29.840
No, I haven't.

33:41.880 --> 33:44.480
Does your brother build
the whole model world,

33:44.480 --> 33:46.040
or is he a train enthusiast only?

33:50.560 --> 33:51.760
Hm!

33:53.200 --> 33:54.760
Oh, Ian loved his trains.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.200
Always did.

33:59.520 --> 34:00.760
Did?

34:10.360 --> 34:12.280
You know the marshes well, do you?

34:17.520 --> 34:18.760
I see them every day.

34:20.800 --> 34:23.159
Can you think of any reason
why someone

34:23.159 --> 34:25.960
would want to place a body
out there...like that?

34:28.199 --> 34:29.600
Not to my knowledge, no.

34:32.719 --> 34:34.600
But if I think of anything, or...

34:36.040 --> 34:37.480
..if I hear something...

34:38.480 --> 34:39.960
..I'll let you know.

34:52.520 --> 34:53.880
Thank you.

34:53.880 --> 34:55.120
You're welcome.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.600
I switched on my phone...

36:40.440 --> 36:41.920
..and there they were.

36:45.440 --> 36:47.120
Message after message.

36:48.240 --> 36:49.400
About Alys.

36:50.680 --> 36:52.040
Two from my boss.

36:53.360 --> 36:55.760
One telling me you lot
were looking for me.

36:56.920 --> 36:58.960
The other sacking me for going AWOL.

37:01.000 --> 37:02.200
So you got drunk.

37:03.920 --> 37:05.600
Then I got angry.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.400
So, what now?

37:12.400 --> 37:14.640
Well, that depends. On what?

37:14.640 --> 37:17.480
On whether you had anything
to do with Alys' death.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.560
Why did you hit Dean?

37:23.120 --> 37:25.960
He's a...waste of space.

37:27.320 --> 37:29.560
Do you think he killed
your daughter?

37:33.880 --> 37:35.400
He's capable of it.

37:39.440 --> 37:41.040
She was...

37:42.040 --> 37:47.000
..a precious...beautiful girl.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.280
She was.

37:52.320 --> 37:53.760
Catch him!

37:57.680 --> 37:58.960
Please.

38:00.880 --> 38:04.560
Catch the man who did this to Alys.

38:10.120 --> 38:12.160
"They took the flowers of the oak

38:12.160 --> 38:14.440
"and the flowers of the broom

38:14.440 --> 38:16.520
"and the flowers of the meadowsweet,

38:16.520 --> 38:18.640
"and from those,
they conjured up the fairest

38:18.640 --> 38:21.200
"and most beautiful maiden
that anyone had ever seen."

38:21.200 --> 38:23.560
"And they baptised her in the way
they did at that time

38:23.560 --> 38:25.320
"and named her Blodeuwedd."

38:25.320 --> 38:27.960
Rootless, lonely and ignored
by the man she was made for.

38:27.960 --> 38:30.200
Hardly the fairytale
it's made out to be.

38:30.200 --> 38:32.600
Dates and times from the hotel
in Borth.

38:33.920 --> 38:36.160
Alys stayed five times in total.

38:36.160 --> 38:39.960
I also ran a check on phone numbers
taken from Alys' mobile. Thanks.

38:39.960 --> 38:42.440
She phoned one number
three times that night

38:42.440 --> 38:45.600
between 6:00 and 6:15pm. No reply.

38:45.600 --> 38:49.120
Then she calls a landline at 6:20pm.

38:49.120 --> 38:51.760
The call only lasted a few minutes.

38:51.760 --> 38:55.040
The landline was traced to an address
on Constitution Hill.

38:56.960 --> 38:58.560
Wynford Rees. Yes, sir.

39:04.520 --> 39:07.400
You shouldn't have gone up to
the marshlands alone like that.

39:07.400 --> 39:09.600
No. It was reckless.
I know. I'm sorry.

39:09.600 --> 39:12.880
You might not value yourself much
but it doesn't mean that we don't.

39:12.880 --> 39:14.240
I said sorry, Mared.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.240
He never asked about Alys. Not once.

39:24.240 --> 39:26.440
Never asked about the case,
how it was going. Who?

39:26.440 --> 39:29.480
Dyfan Richard. He never asked the
questions he should have had asked.

39:29.480 --> 39:30.680
What are you talking about?

39:36.200 --> 39:38.800
Is this Professor Rees' class? Yes.

39:38.800 --> 39:40.600
Where is he? He didn't show.

39:59.080 --> 40:00.960
Mrs Rees? Yes.

40:00.960 --> 40:02.960
Is your husband in?

40:09.360 --> 40:11.920
You weren't at your lecture
this morning, Mr Rees.

40:11.920 --> 40:14.600
My husband hasn't been well.

40:17.080 --> 40:19.160
She started missing classes.

40:19.160 --> 40:22.400
She seemed distracted...

40:22.400 --> 40:24.040
disinterested.

40:25.440 --> 40:29.520
I called her to my office to try
to get to the source of the problem.

40:29.520 --> 40:31.960
Offered one-to-one tutorials to help.

40:31.960 --> 40:34.520
Doesn't explain the large number
of calls she made to you.

40:34.520 --> 40:36.880
Well, she was behind with her work.

40:36.880 --> 40:40.320
She was nervous, panicking, anxious.

40:41.760 --> 40:43.680
It happens sometimes.

40:43.680 --> 40:45.200
She called you at home.

40:47.520 --> 40:49.200
Yes.

40:49.200 --> 40:51.960
You gave her your private number?

40:53.640 --> 40:55.360
She was a troubled soul.

40:55.360 --> 40:57.320
Was the tattoo for you?

40:58.760 --> 41:00.760
Sorry? The tattoo on her arm.

41:03.880 --> 41:06.560
Where were you Monday night,
Mr Rees? Here.

41:06.560 --> 41:08.240
Can anyone verify that? I can.

41:10.280 --> 41:11.960
Wynford and I had dinner together.

41:15.960 --> 41:17.400
Thank you, Mr Rees.

41:20.880 --> 41:24.280
Get Lloyd to run a check
on Wynford Rees. Already on it.

41:24.280 --> 41:26.240
Same goes for Dyfan Richard. Yeah.

41:27.240 --> 41:28.560
Yeah, Mathias.

41:28.560 --> 41:31.240
Sir, it's Lloyd. I think you need
to get down here.

41:45.480 --> 41:47.080
I-It was Dean.

41:48.360 --> 41:49.960
It was Dean that killed Alys.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.040
They got together last summer.

41:58.800 --> 42:00.320
She thought it was just a fling.

42:01.520 --> 42:04.120
But Dean thought it was more
than that.

42:04.120 --> 42:05.400
He loved her?

42:06.640 --> 42:07.840
I think so.

42:09.680 --> 42:10.960
But he'd never admit it.

42:12.560 --> 42:14.560
Why does that hurt you so much,
Sara?

42:18.960 --> 42:20.800
How long have you been seeing Dean?

42:22.280 --> 42:23.680
Six months.

42:23.680 --> 42:25.760
Did Alys know? Yeah.

42:26.840 --> 42:28.360
Did she care? No.

42:29.680 --> 42:30.920
She didn't love Dean?

42:30.920 --> 42:33.920
I told you...it was just a fling.

42:33.920 --> 42:37.320
But to Dean, it meant more?
He couldn't let go?

42:40.160 --> 42:42.120
He was only with me
to be close to her.

42:45.000 --> 42:49.560
He wanted me to dress like her,
dye my hair like her.

42:51.800 --> 42:54.480
He even went and got the same tattoo
on his arm.

42:54.480 --> 42:57.240
Like there was some kind
of connection between them.

42:57.240 --> 42:58.560
But there wasn't?

43:01.000 --> 43:03.600
She hadn't really been close
to anybody recently.

43:06.200 --> 43:09.880
She'd been in a really...weird place.

43:09.880 --> 43:12.000
The Blodeuwedd stuff
in her notebook,

43:12.000 --> 43:13.560
is that what that was about?

43:13.560 --> 43:16.160
She said that her and Blodeuwedd
were the same.

43:17.600 --> 43:22.040
Reckoned they'd been conjured
out of nothing.

43:22.040 --> 43:23.640
Whatever that means.

43:26.720 --> 43:29.280
Monday night,
Dean was at work, wasn't he?

43:31.280 --> 43:35.560
According to this, he was at the
Pier Amusements till gone midnight.

43:35.560 --> 43:38.240
No, he wasn't. Oh, go on.

43:38.240 --> 43:39.800
I couldn't get hold of him.

43:41.280 --> 43:43.800
I went down there about 10:00
and he wasn't there.

43:45.680 --> 43:47.720
The guy looking after the place
was pissed off,

43:47.720 --> 43:50.560
said he hadn't seen Dean for hours.

43:50.560 --> 43:51.840
Where was he, Sara?

43:54.360 --> 43:56.320
You think
he was down on the marshes?

44:40.280 --> 44:41.960
Checked out Dyfan Richard.

44:41.960 --> 44:43.360
His record's clean,

44:43.360 --> 44:46.240
but there was an incident
on the marshes a few years ago.

44:46.240 --> 44:49.400
A run-in with a guy called
John Clancy. He's in prison now.

44:49.400 --> 44:51.920
It was his boys that found the body.
Yeah, exactly.

44:51.920 --> 44:55.280
Shall I go up there and find out
what they know? Yes. Be careful.

45:01.000 --> 45:02.800
Did it hurt?

45:02.800 --> 45:04.680
The tattoo. A bit.

45:06.800 --> 45:08.280
Was it worth it?

45:08.280 --> 45:10.080
Obviously not.

45:10.080 --> 45:12.640
I bet you don't even know
what it means.

45:12.640 --> 45:14.480
It's from Lord Of The Rings.

45:17.760 --> 45:19.840
Where were you on Monday night,
Dean?

45:19.840 --> 45:22.920
I've already told you,
I was down the arcade.

45:22.920 --> 45:24.640
That's not what I've been told.

45:29.240 --> 45:30.680
I was with a girl.

45:30.680 --> 45:32.400
Alys?

45:32.400 --> 45:34.080
In Aber.

45:34.080 --> 45:35.360
Does she have a name?

45:36.800 --> 45:38.680
Kirsten. Kirsten Reid.

47:02.560 --> 47:03.920
Kirsten?

47:58.440 --> 48:01.440
Does the name Dyfan Richard
mean anything to you?

48:01.440 --> 48:02.960
Never heard of him.

48:02.960 --> 48:04.720
What about Wynford Rees?

48:05.800 --> 48:08.000
Alys and Mr Rees spent a lot of time
together.

48:08.000 --> 48:09.320
He didn't love her.

48:09.320 --> 48:10.480
And you did?

48:12.720 --> 48:14.000
Yeah.

48:30.960 --> 48:33.680
Clancy wasn't making any sense.

48:33.680 --> 48:38.360
I told him over and over I hadn't
seen anybody take his horses...

48:38.360 --> 48:39.960
but he wouldn't accept it.

48:39.960 --> 48:42.600
I must've seen something.
That was his take on it.

48:42.600 --> 48:45.560
What about the money you owed
for the building work?

48:46.720 --> 48:51.520
It was nothing. Some slates
on the roof, some plastering work.

48:51.520 --> 48:55.240
I did them a favour,
paid the agreed price.

48:56.480 --> 48:58.600
That's not how they remember it.

48:58.600 --> 49:02.560
There was a deal. Clancy tried
to renegotiate after the event.

49:02.560 --> 49:04.600
What sort of a man does that?

49:20.240 --> 49:22.160
He's in prison now, am I right?

49:23.200 --> 49:25.080
Yeah.

49:25.080 --> 49:26.720
The three boys are alone out there.

49:53.920 --> 49:56.280
It's a terrible thing.

49:56.280 --> 49:58.880
Seeing children abandoned like that.

50:00.680 --> 50:04.280
The eldest boy's 19.
He's doing a good enough job.

50:04.280 --> 50:05.600
Yeah, I'm sure.

50:06.880 --> 50:07.880
And Mr Mathias?

50:09.920 --> 50:11.520
What sort of a job is he doing?

50:14.360 --> 50:15.680
Give him my regards.

50:27.200 --> 50:29.520
I spoke to Kirsten Reid.

50:33.280 --> 50:34.680
Dean's alibi checks out.

50:38.360 --> 50:41.080
How was she? Slow.

50:41.080 --> 50:43.240
Someone to see you in reception.

50:46.000 --> 50:47.400
Release him.

50:52.720 --> 50:54.040
Gwen?

50:58.000 --> 51:00.520
I want to see the place
where Alys was found.

51:06.760 --> 51:09.400
That's not such a good idea. Please?

55:00.040 --> 55:01.520
Thank you.

56:01.360 --> 56:03.360
Ah! Shit!

56:16.240 --> 56:17.880
What is it, Lloyd?

56:17.880 --> 56:20.440
Wynford Rees used to lecture
at Edinburgh Met, sir.

56:20.440 --> 56:24.040
I spoke to the department up there,
he was moved on three years ago.

56:24.040 --> 56:26.840
Moved on? Why?
Accusation of rape, sir.

56:29.600 --> 56:32.240
I want Wynford Rees picked up.
And his wife, too.

56:32.240 --> 56:35.240
And make sure they keep them apart.
Yes, sir.

56:47.720 --> 56:50.320
The charge was dropped. Why?

56:50.320 --> 56:52.800
The girl who made it, Chloe...

56:53.800 --> 56:56.520
..she retracted the accusation.

56:56.520 --> 56:58.960
But you WERE sleeping with her?

56:58.960 --> 57:00.800
Yes.

57:00.800 --> 57:03.120
You took advantage of her.

57:03.120 --> 57:04.560
Just like you did with Alys. No.

57:06.680 --> 57:08.520
Alys was extraordinary.

57:12.160 --> 57:13.520
I stood by him.

57:14.520 --> 57:17.240
How did that make you feel,

57:17.240 --> 57:20.040
your husband, carrying on like that?

57:22.480 --> 57:24.520
I felt nothing.

57:26.240 --> 57:27.840
I-I knew he didn't love them.

57:30.080 --> 57:32.160
But were things different with Alys?

57:34.520 --> 57:36.000
Why are you defending him?

57:37.600 --> 57:39.680
Why did you say you were
with him that night

57:39.680 --> 57:43.160
when you knew he was at the hotel
with Alys?

57:43.160 --> 57:45.760
Because despite everything...

57:47.240 --> 57:48.800
..I still love him.

57:51.440 --> 57:54.440
My husband may be a fool
but he's not a killer.

57:54.440 --> 57:56.680
You seem very sure about that,
Mrs Rees.

57:56.680 --> 57:58.680
Our marriage is a strong one.

58:00.520 --> 58:03.120
The only thing that can
threaten it...

58:05.440 --> 58:06.680
..is love.

58:10.760 --> 58:12.120
And Alys Thomas...

58:14.400 --> 58:16.720
..didn't love my husband.

58:33.963 --> 58:36.843
"They baptised her in the way
that they did at the time

58:36.843 --> 58:38.963
"and named her Blodeuwedd."

58:41.403 --> 58:44.963
There's another reading
to the Blodeuwedd myth, isn't there,
Mr Rees?

58:44.963 --> 58:48.683
It's not all virgins and flowers.

58:50.723 --> 58:53.203
She seduced me. You were her teacher!

58:58.003 --> 59:01.923
Blodeuwedd was created for the sole
purpose of being the king's lover.

59:03.283 --> 59:06.683
If she wasn't going to be his,
she wasn't going to be anybody's.

59:06.683 --> 59:10.803
And so she was condemned to an
eternity of darkness and torment.

59:10.803 --> 59:13.683
Is that what you did to Alys? No...

59:13.683 --> 59:16.683
That's not how it was.
How was it, then?

59:19.523 --> 59:20.963
I was attracted to her.

59:22.123 --> 59:25.403
Alys was everything I wasn't.

59:25.403 --> 59:27.083
Brave.

59:27.083 --> 59:28.803
Talented.

59:29.923 --> 59:30.923
Fearless.

59:30.923 --> 59:34.923
And when you took her out to the
marshes, was she fearless then?

59:34.923 --> 59:36.403
I didn't take her out there.

59:36.403 --> 59:38.883
But you know where
I'm talking about.

59:38.883 --> 59:42.603
You know Borth.
You were at the hotel.

59:42.603 --> 59:45.123
The owner of the hotel,
he heard shouting.

59:45.123 --> 59:47.043
What were you rowing about?

59:47.043 --> 59:49.083
I tried to end it.

59:49.083 --> 59:50.323
Go on.

59:51.603 --> 59:52.963
She phoned...

59:54.723 --> 59:57.003
..demanding to see me...

59:57.003 --> 59:58.883
threatening to come to the house.

01:00:00.163 --> 01:00:02.603
She was going to confront my family.

01:00:04.203 --> 01:00:05.843
So I agreed to meet her.

01:00:05.843 --> 01:00:07.323
To tell her it was over?

01:00:07.323 --> 01:00:09.483
Yes. Why?

01:00:12.203 --> 01:00:14.683
Alys wasn't looking for a lover.

01:00:17.883 --> 01:00:20.083
She was looking for a father.

01:00:30.643 --> 01:00:32.243
Keep him in the cells.

01:01:41.963 --> 01:01:44.683
Were there any other men
in your daughter's life,

01:01:44.683 --> 01:01:46.403
besides your husband?

01:01:49.043 --> 01:01:52.403
Older men? Did she ever talk about
her lecturer?

01:01:56.123 --> 01:01:57.883
What about Dyfan Richard?

01:01:57.883 --> 01:02:00.003
Does that name mean anything to you?

01:02:00.003 --> 01:02:02.723
Why are you asking?
What do you know about him?

01:02:04.563 --> 01:02:06.283
Keeps himself to himself.

01:02:06.283 --> 01:02:08.163
I've never had
anything to do with him.

01:02:08.163 --> 01:02:10.083
But you've seen him about?

01:02:10.083 --> 01:02:11.723
Borth is a small place.

01:02:18.803 --> 01:02:20.163
What happened to you?

01:02:23.003 --> 01:02:24.283
Nothing.

01:07:52.903 --> 01:07:54.343
They're waiting for you.

01:08:07.743 --> 01:08:09.383
After you.

01:08:33.943 --> 01:08:36.063
I went up to the house.

01:08:36.063 --> 01:08:37.983
I saw your car.

01:08:37.983 --> 01:08:39.823
I respected you!

01:08:39.823 --> 01:08:41.863
Maybe I was wrong to.

01:08:41.863 --> 01:08:43.743
That's enough, Iwan!

01:08:46.143 --> 01:08:47.303
Go home.

01:08:48.903 --> 01:08:50.103
Tom, a word.

01:08:52.023 --> 01:08:54.183
Yaaarrrggghhh!

01:08:54.183 --> 01:08:56.823
You! You! It's you!

01:08:56.823 --> 01:08:59.023
Take him down to the cell!

01:08:59.023 --> 01:09:01.502
N-o-o-o-o-o-o!

01:09:01.502 --> 01:09:03.263
Is that necessary, sir?

01:09:03.263 --> 01:09:06.622
The man is grieving. He's lost
his daughter, he's lost everything!

01:09:06.622 --> 01:09:09.303
I know him better than you do! Sir?

01:09:11.703 --> 01:09:14.502
Dyfan Richard complained about
the family on the marsh

01:09:14.502 --> 01:09:16.183
23 times in the last four months.

01:09:16.183 --> 01:09:17.783
That's once every three days.

01:09:17.783 --> 01:09:19.263
It's like he was watching them.

01:09:19.263 --> 01:09:22.183
I've got the phone records
and reports. Watching?

01:09:22.183 --> 01:09:24.063
What?
You said like he was watching them.

01:09:24.063 --> 01:09:26.303
Yes. That's what it says
in the report. Watching.

01:09:30.783 --> 01:09:32.103
Tom, wait!

01:09:33.343 --> 01:09:35.263
Wynford Rees is downstairs.

01:09:35.263 --> 01:09:38.542
We have evidence,
motive, a strong case.

01:09:38.542 --> 01:09:41.622
He was with her that night.
They fought, she stormed off.

01:09:41.622 --> 01:09:44.223
He's the last known person
to have seen her alive!

01:10:16.103 --> 01:10:17.463
Watching...

01:10:21.383 --> 01:10:22.943
Where are you going?

01:10:24.703 --> 01:10:26.823
Dyfan Richard spent his life
watching Alys.

01:10:26.823 --> 01:10:28.863
Watching her every movement.

01:10:28.863 --> 01:10:30.183
Why?

01:10:31.423 --> 01:10:33.903
You don't believe me?
I don't know what to believe.

01:10:36.863 --> 01:10:38.983
You went up there on your own.

01:10:42.023 --> 01:10:43.623
Did you sleep with her?

01:10:45.863 --> 01:10:47.023
Did you?

01:10:51.143 --> 01:10:52.543
Check the tape.

01:11:08.863 --> 01:11:10.543
Chwarae fe nol.

01:11:15.383 --> 01:11:16.743
Dyfan Richard.

01:11:51.783 --> 01:11:54.023
I can stand here for hours
and never be bored.

01:11:57.383 --> 01:11:58.903
There's so much out there.

01:12:02.303 --> 01:12:03.943
She was your friend, wasn't she?

01:12:05.623 --> 01:12:06.823
Alys.

01:12:08.783 --> 01:12:10.383
I don't know.

01:12:11.743 --> 01:12:13.183
I didn't know her.

01:12:14.183 --> 01:12:15.663
Not really.

01:12:18.903 --> 01:12:20.663
You've been lying to me, Dyfan.

01:12:22.383 --> 01:12:24.263
Is that what you think?

01:12:24.263 --> 01:12:28.143
I think you've been watching Alys
the whole time you've lived here.

01:12:28.143 --> 01:12:32.183
I think you've been watching
the family. And me.

01:12:32.183 --> 01:12:34.663
You've been watching me, too,
haven't you, Dyfan?

01:12:38.223 --> 01:12:42.583
Never a smile on those ruby red lips.

01:12:48.383 --> 01:12:50.903
It was you who phoned Iwan,
wasn't it?

01:12:50.903 --> 01:12:52.663
Sent him up to the house.

01:12:57.023 --> 01:12:58.463
I expected better from you.

01:12:59.943 --> 01:13:03.183
Alys needed someone.
Someone outside of it all.

01:13:04.303 --> 01:13:05.743
Outside of her life.

01:13:07.143 --> 01:13:10.223
Someone different she could talk
to who wouldn't judge,

01:13:10.223 --> 01:13:12.263
or harm...

01:13:12.263 --> 01:13:14.263
or seek to influence her.

01:13:14.263 --> 01:13:15.543
And that was you?

01:13:17.183 --> 01:13:18.783
I probably needed the same.

01:13:18.783 --> 01:13:21.143
Were you in love with her?

01:13:21.143 --> 01:13:25.143
Ours was a friendship. Pure.

01:13:25.143 --> 01:13:29.023
How could I harm a hair on her head?

01:13:31.903 --> 01:13:33.103
She lit up my day.

01:13:34.143 --> 01:13:35.903
And I hope somehow...

01:13:37.143 --> 01:13:39.023
..I managed the same for her.

01:13:39.023 --> 01:13:42.183
Did you kill her? No.

01:13:43.503 --> 01:13:45.303
Did you need to silence her, Dyfan?

01:13:45.303 --> 01:13:47.103
Did she become too much for you?

01:13:48.743 --> 01:13:50.183
Did she threaten to tell?

01:13:50.183 --> 01:13:52.543
I was prepared to ignore the rumours.

01:13:55.103 --> 01:13:57.063
But they seem to be true.

01:13:57.063 --> 01:14:00.663
You seem to possess
a chequered past, Mr Mathias.

01:14:02.343 --> 01:14:04.903
I like to take an interest in those
who take an interest in me.

01:14:07.983 --> 01:14:10.743
Apologies if I touched a raw nerve.

01:14:13.743 --> 01:14:15.223
Wait, Dyfan!

01:14:15.223 --> 01:14:17.263
Dyfan!

01:14:45.063 --> 01:14:46.423
Where the hell have you been?!

01:14:46.423 --> 01:14:48.943
Where I should've been
since this investigation started.

01:14:48.943 --> 01:14:51.303
Have you questioned Wynford Rees
again? No.

01:14:51.303 --> 01:14:52.743
Why not? Because despite being

01:14:52.743 --> 01:14:55.503
the most frustrating senior officer
I've ever worked with,

01:14:55.503 --> 01:14:58.103
I think you might be right
about Dyfan Richard.

01:14:59.623 --> 01:15:02.063
We saw the tape, sir.

01:15:03.983 --> 01:15:07.143
I need to search Dyfan Richard's
house. What for?

01:15:07.143 --> 01:15:09.863
He's lied to us. Alys was there.

01:15:09.863 --> 01:15:12.063
It was Dyfan Richard that killed
her, I'm sure of it.

01:15:13.423 --> 01:15:15.263
We don't have any hard evidence.

01:15:17.823 --> 01:15:20.263
All I want is to search the house.

01:15:20.263 --> 01:15:23.623
He admits Alys was there,
so we have grounds.

01:15:23.623 --> 01:15:27.103
I'm not going to apply
for a warrant on a hunch. No.

01:15:36.063 --> 01:15:38.143
With consent. Get him to let you in.

01:15:38.143 --> 01:15:39.903
If you find anything significant,

01:15:39.903 --> 01:15:42.223
then I'll back that up
with a warrant. It's him.

01:16:13.983 --> 01:16:15.343
What now?

01:16:15.343 --> 01:16:18.543
We'd like you to come to the station
so we can confirm a few details.

01:16:18.543 --> 01:16:20.383
Helping the police
with their enquires.

01:16:21.543 --> 01:16:23.183
Something like that.

01:16:23.183 --> 01:16:24.943
I'll need a solicitor.

01:16:26.223 --> 01:16:27.463
Of course.

01:16:37.783 --> 01:16:40.583
What do you do
with all these models?

01:16:40.583 --> 01:16:42.463
I don't see any miniature railway.

01:16:44.943 --> 01:16:46.183
There was a break-in.

01:16:48.103 --> 01:16:49.823
They smashed it all to pieces.

01:16:52.543 --> 01:16:54.103
It was really upsetting for me.

01:16:56.103 --> 01:16:57.863
Now I make models to order.

01:17:00.663 --> 01:17:02.263
For others' pleasure.

01:17:08.743 --> 01:17:09.863
Sir.

01:17:17.063 --> 01:17:18.863
Nothing. The place is clean.

01:17:18.863 --> 01:17:20.743
Go back to the station
and tell Prosser.

01:17:20.743 --> 01:17:24.223
If I'm wrong, I'll interview
Wynford Rees on my return.

01:17:28.463 --> 01:17:30.023
I don't think you're wrong, sir.

01:17:41.623 --> 01:17:43.583
Just keep him as long you can, OK?

01:17:43.583 --> 01:17:44.863
I'll do my best.

01:18:04.943 --> 01:18:06.663
This is DCI Mathias.

01:18:09.743 --> 01:18:13.343
You said Dyfan Richard owed money
to your father for building work?
That's right.

01:18:13.343 --> 01:18:15.463
When was this? Two years ago.

01:18:15.463 --> 01:18:18.103
How well do you know the building?

01:18:18.103 --> 01:18:20.663
Better than anyone else. Why? Good.

01:18:20.663 --> 01:18:23.943
Come with me.
What about my brothers?

01:18:25.423 --> 01:18:26.823
I'll take care of them.

01:18:41.903 --> 01:18:44.383
It's like a warren in there. Is it?

01:18:47.703 --> 01:18:49.463
Have we met before?

01:18:59.303 --> 01:19:01.983
I thought you were stealing
my horses.

01:19:01.983 --> 01:19:04.823
I didn't meant to take
the photograph.

01:19:04.823 --> 01:19:07.583
I just wanted to find out
who you were.

01:19:07.583 --> 01:19:09.383
I didn't mean to hit you.

01:19:11.503 --> 01:19:13.303
You didn't have to tell me that.

01:19:13.303 --> 01:19:14.823
I know.

01:19:16.863 --> 01:19:18.663
Does that make me stupid?

01:19:20.583 --> 01:19:22.423
I hope not.

01:19:25.263 --> 01:19:27.383
But I'd like that photograph back.

01:19:30.903 --> 01:19:32.303
Deal.

01:19:43.703 --> 01:19:45.703
I'm not what you think I am.

01:19:49.623 --> 01:19:51.303
I know what love is.

01:19:53.303 --> 01:19:55.423
What being close to someone
feels like.

01:20:09.823 --> 01:20:13.223
You need to charge me or let me go.

01:20:30.783 --> 01:20:32.583
Don't do that! Why not?

01:20:32.583 --> 01:20:35.543
What if someone calls the police?
You haven't got a warrant!

01:20:42.783 --> 01:20:44.383
Through here.

01:22:23.943 --> 01:22:25.383
That's brilliant!

01:23:09.343 --> 01:23:12.903
Mared?
Not good news. We had to let him go.

01:23:12.903 --> 01:23:15.543
'Prosser refused to hold him
any longer.

01:23:15.543 --> 01:23:18.023
'Listen, Tom, I'm really sorry.

01:23:19.383 --> 01:23:20.583
'Tom?

01:23:22.063 --> 01:23:23.383
'Tom?'

01:23:29.703 --> 01:23:31.423
Get him back on the phone!

01:23:43.583 --> 01:23:46.983
Get a unit over to Gwen's place and
another over to Dyfan Richard now!

01:23:46.983 --> 01:23:48.383
We're on it.

01:23:48.383 --> 01:23:49.863
Lloyd, with me, now!

01:23:57.023 --> 01:23:59.943
Come on, Gwen!
Come on, pick up, please!

01:24:15.343 --> 01:24:16.863
Gwen!

01:28:03.023 --> 01:28:04.623
That night...

01:28:06.983 --> 01:28:09.143
..Alys knocked on the door.

01:28:11.063 --> 01:28:12.783
She'd lost her phone.

01:28:16.783 --> 01:28:18.583
She couldn't get back into the hotel.

01:28:23.103 --> 01:28:24.863
She was upset.

01:28:27.183 --> 01:28:28.743
She'd missed the last train.

01:28:31.343 --> 01:28:34.383
I...invited her in.

01:28:35.903 --> 01:28:37.503
Said I'd phone a taxi.

01:28:51.983 --> 01:28:53.783
I never meant to kill her.

01:28:58.023 --> 01:29:00.263
She picked the model I'd made of her.

01:29:00.263 --> 01:29:02.063
She started to talk to it.

01:29:03.343 --> 01:29:07.223
Asking the model about me,
about the "weirdo"...as she put it.

01:29:09.503 --> 01:29:11.943
"What's it like
living with a weirdo?"

01:29:13.343 --> 01:29:14.863
I told her to stop.

01:29:16.903 --> 01:29:18.743
She just laughed at me.

01:29:21.583 --> 01:29:23.223
I held her.

01:29:24.943 --> 01:29:27.823
Both arms...and asked her to stop.

01:29:27.823 --> 01:29:31.063
She shrugged me off,
told me where to go.

01:29:33.703 --> 01:29:35.383
And then she fell.

01:29:37.663 --> 01:29:39.423
Knocked her head against the table.

01:29:42.343 --> 01:29:44.143
I heard her neck snap.

01:29:47.423 --> 01:29:49.863
I wanted her to rest
somewhere beautiful.

01:29:51.543 --> 01:29:54.943
Somewhere where I could see her
every day.

01:29:56.103 --> 01:30:00.503
At the exact centre...of my world.

01:30:04.943 --> 01:30:06.503
Here.

01:30:10.743 --> 01:30:14.423
She looked so...beautiful.

01:30:27.823 --> 01:30:29.303
Why Gwen?

01:30:35.223 --> 01:30:37.103
Why did you do it?

01:30:37.103 --> 01:30:40.223
She brought her sordid ways
to this sacred place.

01:30:43.303 --> 01:30:45.303
She should've been heartbroken.

01:30:46.943 --> 01:30:48.503
But she took you to her bed.

01:30:50.103 --> 01:30:52.303
I expected so much more of you.

01:30:54.303 --> 01:30:56.503
You killed her daughter, Dyfan.

01:31:00.023 --> 01:31:02.383
Hadn't you made her suffer enough?

01:31:02.383 --> 01:31:05.143
They should never have had
that little girl.

01:31:07.623 --> 01:31:09.943
She should've been with me. Why?

01:31:12.023 --> 01:31:15.423
Why in this world
should she be with you?

01:31:20.863 --> 01:31:22.343
Alys was my daughter.

01:31:28.903 --> 01:31:32.503
Now all I want is to be with her.

01:31:41.343 --> 01:31:43.503
I thought you were going to do it
for me.

01:31:53.063 --> 01:31:56.583
But it looks like I'm going to have
to do it for myself.

01:31:56.583 --> 01:31:57.943
No!

01:32:10.663 --> 01:32:11.863
Where are you?

01:32:11.863 --> 01:32:14.783
I'm in the marshes with Richard.
I need an ambulance now!

01:32:14.783 --> 01:32:16.663
Lloyd!

01:33:13.743 --> 01:33:15.623
The ambulance is on its way!

01:33:15.623 --> 01:33:17.463
Hey!

01:33:17.463 --> 01:33:19.023
You OK?

01:33:20.583 --> 01:33:23.423
Gwen died...because of me.

01:33:30.783 --> 01:33:32.303
He's going to make it.

01:33:45.023 --> 01:33:46.423
Tom?

01:33:51.743 --> 01:33:53.063
Tom!

01:33:54.305 --> 01:34:00.824
