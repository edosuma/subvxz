01:52.878 --> 01:55.011
It's difficult
news for John to take in

01:55.013 --> 01:57.746
but the DNA test confirms
that his biological mother

01:57.748 --> 02:00.716
is indeed Jean-Marie Claude
a Parisian dentist

02:00.718 --> 02:02.985
who murdered her husband
in cold blood.

02:02.987 --> 02:05.988
It's horrifying,
to think all this time

02:05.990 --> 02:07.457
I've been French.

02:07.459 --> 02:09.459
As John
looks out to the horizon

02:09.461 --> 02:11.293
he must question
whether he wants to go on

02:11.295 --> 02:12.895
with his journey.

02:12.897 --> 02:14.731
Will meeting his mother
give him the answers

02:14.733 --> 02:16.266
he's always wanted

02:16.268 --> 02:17.966
or will she be
the very nightmare

02:17.968 --> 02:20.171
we all know French people
to be?

02:29.681 --> 02:31.049
Shit.

02:34.953 --> 02:37.887
This is a
long-distance call from Australia.

02:38.456 --> 02:39.822
Hello?

02:39.824 --> 02:41.791
Who...
Who's this?

02:41.793 --> 02:43.760
Where's Gabriella?

02:43.762 --> 02:47.363
Tell her it's Mary Pearce
and I've almost got the money.

02:47.365 --> 02:48.498
When did you make your order?

02:48.500 --> 02:52.234
Because we're having a bit of
a sausage crisis lately.

02:52.236 --> 02:53.303
Who are you?

02:53.305 --> 02:54.404
Norman, her son.

02:54.406 --> 02:56.005
Normie?

02:56.007 --> 02:58.875
And you still live at home?

02:58.877 --> 02:59.809
Bloody hell.

03:15.092 --> 03:16.159
Just a minute!

03:16.161 --> 03:18.229
Oh, shit!

03:48.425 --> 03:50.025
Ohh!

03:50.027 --> 03:51.126
Prick.

03:51.128 --> 03:52.095
What'd you say?

03:52.097 --> 03:56.098
You're a Polish prick
with a baby's dick.

03:56.100 --> 03:58.066
Right.

03:58.068 --> 03:59.938
Send my best to your mother,
Rachel.

04:17.988 --> 04:20.255
Please, just fuck off!

04:57.629 --> 05:00.262
So it's an unpaid student film

05:00.264 --> 05:02.100
and you want me to get
a tit out?

05:04.603 --> 05:05.937
I'll think about it.

05:22.454 --> 05:24.620
Couldn't find a church?

05:24.622 --> 05:27.257
It's traditional to do the wake
at home in Poland.

05:27.259 --> 05:29.625
Not that you'd know.

05:29.627 --> 05:32.127
And is it traditional to put
the coffin by the meat freeze?

05:32.129 --> 05:33.596
Well, I couldn't get it up
the stairs

05:33.598 --> 05:36.100
and I thought
she'd stay fresher here.

05:38.202 --> 05:39.067
Who did her make-up?

05:39.069 --> 05:40.904
Liza Minnelli?

05:40.906 --> 05:42.171
Annabelle?

05:42.173 --> 05:43.106
Oh!

05:43.108 --> 05:44.373
Hello!

05:46.944 --> 05:48.110
You what?

05:48.112 --> 05:49.378
Oh, she must have seen
your advert.

05:49.380 --> 05:51.216
The stool softener.

05:52.550 --> 05:53.548
Oh yes.

05:53.550 --> 05:55.250
Well, it pays the bills.

05:58.689 --> 05:59.622
She's wondering
whether they made you

05:59.624 --> 06:00.456
take the pills,

06:00.458 --> 06:01.690
because you've lost
a lot of weight.

06:01.692 --> 06:04.060
You used to be a bit bigger.

06:04.062 --> 06:06.329
- Really, really...
- Yes, I get the picture.

06:06.331 --> 06:10.033
You big, big.

06:10.035 --> 06:11.433
Well I'm a vegan now, actually.

06:11.435 --> 06:12.604
It's far more salubrious.

06:25.416 --> 06:26.517
Mum would have been so proud.

06:29.653 --> 06:31.253
She loved us both
as if we were here own.

06:31.255 --> 06:32.587
What does that mean?

06:44.336 --> 06:45.500
Keep.
Charity shop.

06:45.502 --> 06:46.437
Discard.

06:50.274 --> 06:51.140
What are you doing?

06:51.142 --> 06:53.544
This...
this was her favourite record.

06:57.148 --> 06:58.447
Why is Mr Mateusz in here?

06:58.449 --> 07:00.082
Mr Mateusz is disgusting.

07:00.084 --> 07:01.183
Well what is it, a rat?

07:01.185 --> 07:05.187
He is a bear.

07:05.189 --> 07:06.524
This has still got her hair
on it.

07:08.660 --> 07:11.461
Who are the Twits?

07:11.463 --> 07:13.462
They're our great-grandparents.

07:13.464 --> 07:15.298
Bogumil and Bogumila.

07:15.300 --> 07:17.699
On their wedding day.

07:17.701 --> 07:19.301
You know that Mum traced
our family line

07:19.303 --> 07:22.005
all the way back
to King Casimir the Great.

07:22.007 --> 07:23.274
Oh, great!

07:25.377 --> 07:27.075
It wouldn't kill you to take
a bit more of an interest

07:27.077 --> 07:28.543
in where you come from.

07:28.545 --> 07:30.712
Would I get to inherit
the family business, then?

07:30.714 --> 07:32.081
You left to pursue
your own career.

07:32.083 --> 07:33.483
No I ran away, actually.

07:33.485 --> 07:34.784
Mum drove you to the station.

07:34.786 --> 07:36.084
You were always the favourite.

07:36.086 --> 07:37.219
That's not fair.

07:37.221 --> 07:38.788
Well why do you think she sent
you to a private school,

07:38.790 --> 07:40.389
while I had to slum it
in state?

07:40.391 --> 07:41.656
You were expelled
from that school

07:41.658 --> 07:43.793
for making a headmaster cry.

07:43.795 --> 07:45.060
My little angel Norman

07:45.062 --> 07:48.464
with his bright,
blonde lesbian hair.

07:48.466 --> 07:50.166
You were always going
to get everything, weren't you?

07:50.168 --> 07:51.401
I stayed, Anna,

07:51.403 --> 07:53.769
because family means
something to me.

07:53.771 --> 07:56.272
And why is it lesbian hair?

07:56.274 --> 07:57.807
Anna?

07:57.809 --> 08:00.610
Anna?

08:00.612 --> 08:03.314
"She loved us
as if we were her own."

08:05.617 --> 08:07.186
Because we weren't.

08:08.653 --> 08:10.485
This is our real mother.

08:10.487 --> 08:11.753
Mary Pearce.

08:23.267 --> 08:25.300
Is that?

08:25.302 --> 08:27.135
Yup.

08:27.137 --> 08:28.204
Did you do this?

08:28.206 --> 08:29.204
Don't anger them.

08:29.206 --> 08:30.139
Anna.

08:30.141 --> 08:32.244
I asked you a question, bitch.

08:35.245 --> 08:37.015
It's called acting, darling.

08:41.251 --> 08:44.152
I just knew I was adopted.

08:44.154 --> 08:46.789
So this Mary.

08:46.791 --> 08:48.791
She made a deal with Gabriella,
did she?

08:48.793 --> 08:51.828
Something about money.

08:51.830 --> 08:54.430
Well, I'll look up flights,
but you're paying.

08:54.432 --> 08:56.531
I couldn't even afford
a proper funeral, Anna.

08:56.533 --> 08:58.600
Well you could.

08:58.602 --> 09:00.368
If you sold the butcher's.

09:00.370 --> 09:01.603
Norman.

09:01.605 --> 09:03.539
Mum put everything
into this place, Anna.

09:03.541 --> 09:05.842
She's not our Mum!

09:05.844 --> 09:07.877
She's been lying to us.

09:07.879 --> 09:11.613
There's no Bogmila,
no Bogmula,

09:11.615 --> 09:15.318
- no King Calamari.
- It's Casimir.

09:15.320 --> 09:16.688
Norman, look.

09:18.556 --> 09:20.388
I am your older sister.

09:20.390 --> 09:21.590
By two and a half minutes.

09:21.592 --> 09:23.559
Which makes you...

09:23.561 --> 09:25.427
The parasitic twin.

09:25.429 --> 09:26.095
Yes, I know.

09:26.097 --> 09:28.830
So I can be honest with you.

09:28.832 --> 09:33.669
And honestly, you are though
mildly endearing

09:33.671 --> 09:36.339
a completely useless
human being.

09:36.341 --> 09:37.906
You don't belong here.

09:37.908 --> 09:39.474
You're not a butcher.

09:39.476 --> 09:41.209
You can't butch.

09:41.211 --> 09:42.377
You can't cook.

09:42.379 --> 09:44.680
You... you can't clean.

09:44.682 --> 09:49.785
But you're finally freeto
find out who you really are.

09:49.787 --> 09:52.188
Now are you going to snub
that opportunity

09:52.190 --> 09:54.323
to spend the rest of your life
rubbing chicken breasts

09:54.325 --> 09:55.491
together in Slough?

09:55.493 --> 09:57.329
Piss off back to Poland!

09:59.931 --> 10:03.232
What did Gabriella used to say
when we used to go to church?

10:03.234 --> 10:05.401
Family goes...

10:05.403 --> 10:07.502
Razem.

10:07.504 --> 10:09.539
Together.

10:09.541 --> 10:12.211
So, you coming or not?

10:14.479 --> 10:16.478
Okay.

10:16.480 --> 10:17.847
You're paying.

10:17.849 --> 10:19.248
Razem.

10:50.748 --> 10:51.948
Anna.

10:51.950 --> 10:52.581
- Anna!
- What?

10:52.583 --> 10:53.949
What?
What is it now?

10:53.951 --> 10:55.550
This... this place,
Two Heads Creek.

10:55.552 --> 10:57.453
- It's not on the map.
- Map?

10:57.455 --> 10:58.753
You're not fucking
Indiana Jones, Norman.

10:58.755 --> 11:00.989
Google it.

11:00.991 --> 11:03.225
Oh look, you've gone global.

11:03.227 --> 11:04.629
Oh, fuck off, Norman.

11:12.302 --> 11:13.437
Gidday, gidday.

11:15.974 --> 11:18.473
Previous criminal record?

11:18.475 --> 11:20.846
Why, is that a prerequisite
for entry?

11:34.024 --> 11:35.593
They help me sleep.

11:40.298 --> 11:41.397
That's antique.

11:41.399 --> 11:42.734
My mother's.

11:48.740 --> 11:50.605
And that is my mother.

11:50.607 --> 11:52.810
Mum, what are you doing here?

12:04.522 --> 12:06.022
Now I have no problem
with the blades

12:06.024 --> 12:08.491
and the pingas, sir.

12:08.493 --> 12:10.459
But I'd like to draw
your attention

12:10.461 --> 12:14.463
to the immigration card
that you filled in upon arrival

12:14.465 --> 12:18.501
where it clearly states that
foreign bodies, dead or alive

12:18.503 --> 12:20.335
carry the risk of contamination

12:20.337 --> 12:25.974
to Australia's unique
and individual eco-system.

12:25.976 --> 12:29.545
I've no choice
but to issue you with a fine.

12:29.547 --> 12:32.614
final destination in Australia.

12:32.616 --> 12:33.851
Two Heads Creek.

12:36.721 --> 12:37.822
What did you say?

12:40.857 --> 12:42.393
Two Heads Creek.

12:45.697 --> 12:47.530
You wanna go to Two Heads Creek?

12:47.532 --> 12:48.531
Can I speak to your manager?

12:48.533 --> 12:49.632
I am my manager.

12:49.634 --> 12:51.733
Then you have no right
to detain us without reason.

12:51.735 --> 12:53.069
- Anna just...
- No, excuse me.

12:53.071 --> 12:55.403
So unless you want me
to compose a negative tweet

12:55.405 --> 12:58.074
about our experiences
here today

12:58.076 --> 13:00.879
Clive, I suggest you
let us through at once.

13:06.049 --> 13:08.550
Oh well in that case
I'll get someone to show you

13:08.552 --> 13:10.685
to the bus stop.

13:10.687 --> 13:11.554
What about the fine?

13:11.556 --> 13:12.921
Ah, it's fine.

13:12.923 --> 13:14.357
Fine, yeah.

13:16.461 --> 13:17.425
No,
you just have a wonderful stay

13:17.427 --> 13:19.962
in Australia, Norman.

13:19.964 --> 13:21.333
How did you know my name?

13:26.471 --> 13:27.505
See you round like a rissole.

13:41.918 --> 13:43.355
Two Heads Creek?

13:44.721 --> 13:46.789
Gidday gidday!

13:46.791 --> 13:48.723
Well don't just stand there,
climb on board.

13:48.725 --> 13:50.126
Everyone's welcome.

13:50.128 --> 13:52.594
Apari, bags.

13:52.596 --> 13:54.897
You take bags.

13:54.899 --> 13:56.132
Okay?

13:56.134 --> 13:57.699
Thank you.

13:57.701 --> 13:59.134
- Norman?
- Mmm?

13:59.136 --> 14:01.837
Why is everyone Chinese?

14:01.839 --> 14:03.605
You can't say that, Anna.

14:03.607 --> 14:05.674
What, Chinese?

14:05.676 --> 14:06.709
Oh, for goodness sake, Norman.

14:06.711 --> 14:09.578
I think we can say Chinese
if they're Chinese.

14:09.580 --> 14:11.180
I'm Vietnamese.

14:11.182 --> 14:12.214
What?

14:12.216 --> 14:14.682
Oh oh, no no no,
I didn't sort of mean everyone.

14:14.684 --> 14:17.118
I just sort of meant you know
because... because...

14:17.120 --> 14:19.021
Oh, shut up.

14:19.023 --> 14:21.956
What a magical day.

14:21.958 --> 14:24.794
Ever since her discovery
in 1770

14:24.796 --> 14:27.629
this prosperous country
has been built on the hard work

14:27.631 --> 14:31.599
and dedication of immigrants
just like yourselves.

14:31.601 --> 14:35.503
Without you, without us
there would literally be

14:35.505 --> 14:39.608
nothing here of any value
whatsoever at all.

14:39.610 --> 14:41.944
So on behalf of the state
of Queensland

14:41.946 --> 14:43.579
the Commonwealth of Australia

14:43.581 --> 14:48.184
and His Majesty
Prince George gidday.

14:48.186 --> 14:50.886
So now I'd like to invite you
to sit back relax and enjoy

14:50.888 --> 14:54.589
the quick 10-hour journey
to your final destination.

14:54.591 --> 14:56.658
Come on.

14:56.660 --> 15:00.528
I can't believe we're actually
going to meet her.

15:00.530 --> 15:01.564
Wonder what she'll be like.

15:01.566 --> 15:02.998
Like...

15:03.000 --> 15:04.098
What does she do?

15:04.100 --> 15:06.234
What does she eat?

15:06.236 --> 15:08.470
What does she smell like?

15:08.472 --> 15:09.472
Norman!

15:09.474 --> 15:10.705
I've had
a very stressful flight,

15:10.707 --> 15:12.141
I haven't slept for two days

15:12.143 --> 15:14.008
it's so hot
I think my boobs are melting.

15:14.010 --> 15:16.845
But is it too much to ask
for a bit of peace and quiet?

15:59.990 --> 16:01.089
The bus is on fire!

16:01.091 --> 16:02.257
The bus in on fire!

16:02.259 --> 16:04.225
You're all gonna die!

16:05.162 --> 16:06.094
Well done, everyone.

16:06.096 --> 16:08.696
That was a drill
and you all did very well.

16:08.698 --> 16:10.901
Well, this is as far
as the bus goes.

16:13.671 --> 16:14.869
That's it.

16:14.871 --> 16:17.205
Gather 'round.

16:17.207 --> 16:18.610
Is that everyone?

16:20.745 --> 16:22.911
Do try to avoid the koalas.

16:22.913 --> 16:26.080
If they urinate on you,
you will contract chlamydia.

16:26.082 --> 16:29.251
It's like this town is stuck
in the '70s.

16:29.253 --> 16:31.152
Yeah, I'd say it's more '60s.

16:31.154 --> 16:33.555
Let's just agree that it's shit.

16:33.557 --> 16:35.291
Built originally as a pig farm

16:35.293 --> 16:37.993
Two Heads has since become
one of the most innovative

16:37.995 --> 16:40.930
and culturally rich towns
in the southern hemisphere.

16:40.932 --> 16:42.165
With the support from the

16:42.167 --> 16:45.733
Worldwide Australian National
Citizenship Authority Scheme

16:45.735 --> 16:47.802
we have proudly been
initiating newcomers

16:47.804 --> 16:51.105
into the country
for over 20 years.

16:51.107 --> 16:53.575
So it's like a town
for immigrants.

16:53.577 --> 16:54.377
Oh, heaven.

16:54.379 --> 16:56.514
Our mother lives
in a refugee camp.

16:59.716 --> 17:01.151
Here we have the village hall.

17:03.988 --> 17:08.623
Our world-famous stationery shop
inspired by JA Burchill.

17:08.625 --> 17:10.028
He invented the notepad.

17:12.730 --> 17:14.363
Our local second-hand store.

17:14.365 --> 17:15.730
Two Heads is known
as one of the first

17:15.732 --> 17:18.800
carbon neutral towns
on the planet.

17:18.803 --> 17:20.935
Pearce.

17:20.938 --> 17:22.904
Yeah.

17:22.906 --> 17:24.640
Our very own footy field.

17:24.642 --> 17:25.911
Australian Rules, of course.

17:28.144 --> 17:29.777
The butcher's.

17:29.779 --> 17:32.046
And if you'll head this way,
you'll see our world-famous

17:32.048 --> 17:33.949
Villagers Arms Hotel

17:33.951 --> 17:37.251
the beating heart
of our community.

17:37.253 --> 17:38.720
She owns the butcher's, too.

17:38.722 --> 17:40.154
She owns everything.

17:40.156 --> 17:42.958
Maybe that's where
she met Gabriella.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.058
Where are you going?

17:44.060 --> 17:45.995
She lives at number 66.

17:45.997 --> 17:48.029
Anna, we can't just deviate
from the tour.

17:48.031 --> 17:49.033
Anna!

17:51.301 --> 17:52.634
Oh, fine.

17:52.636 --> 17:54.003
Don't worry about the bags.

17:54.005 --> 17:55.638
I'll get the bags.

18:23.968 --> 18:25.234
Looks like she's out.

18:25.236 --> 18:26.367
No.

18:26.369 --> 18:27.638
Really?

18:32.977 --> 18:33.912
Anna.

18:35.880 --> 18:36.879
Anna, that's breaking in.

18:36.881 --> 18:38.216
I'm not breaking in.

18:40.084 --> 18:41.086
Anna.

18:49.026 --> 18:50.629
Okay, I'm breaking in.

18:51.796 --> 18:53.731
Anna!

18:54.798 --> 18:55.767
Anna?

19:00.237 --> 19:02.173
Anna?

19:03.441 --> 19:05.644
Anna, where are you?

19:06.777 --> 19:08.410
Anna, this is not funny.

19:57.228 --> 19:59.294
Jesus Christ!

20:11.342 --> 20:12.975
Anna.

20:12.977 --> 20:14.979
Where are you?

20:24.020 --> 20:25.319
That's not a knife!

20:26.891 --> 20:29.091
Do not sneak up on me like that,
Anna.

20:29.093 --> 20:31.492
She's got loads of 'em.

20:31.494 --> 20:33.394
Look.

20:49.946 --> 20:51.345
There's something not
quite right about this place.

20:51.347 --> 20:52.447
Anna.

20:52.449 --> 20:53.582
I know it's a little bit
dilapidated,

20:53.584 --> 20:55.517
but I think
with a lick of paint,

20:55.519 --> 20:58.019
it could be alright.

21:27.483 --> 21:30.254
Now this is a knife.

21:33.089 --> 21:34.623
Oh come on, Norman,
where are your balls?

21:34.625 --> 21:36.190
Will you stop being sexist?

21:36.192 --> 21:37.426
How am I being sexist?

21:37.428 --> 21:38.927
My desire not to be killed
has nothing to do

21:38.929 --> 21:41.395
with having
or not having testicles.

21:41.397 --> 21:43.433
Well there's no need to be
a whining pussy about it.

21:59.916 --> 22:01.019
Hi.

22:07.991 --> 22:09.594
Maybe if you just hit it harder.

22:12.596 --> 22:13.562
Hey.

22:13.564 --> 22:17.266
Ah, is this the reception?

22:17.268 --> 22:19.267
No.

22:19.269 --> 22:21.205
Reception's over there.

22:24.508 --> 22:26.341
Okay.

22:38.622 --> 22:41.155
You're the talk of the town.

22:41.157 --> 22:44.359
We don't get many Europeans.

22:44.361 --> 22:46.495
Do you know Prince George?

22:46.497 --> 22:48.563
No.

22:48.565 --> 22:51.603
Oh, I was only joking.

22:53.170 --> 22:54.236
We're looking for our
mother, actually.

22:54.238 --> 22:55.970
She lives on this road.

22:55.972 --> 22:58.340
Number 66.

22:58.342 --> 23:00.007
That's old Mary Pearce's place.

23:00.009 --> 23:02.044
Mary Pearce, yes.

23:02.046 --> 23:03.679
Yeah, but Mary Pearce is...

23:03.681 --> 23:05.450
Dead.

23:13.289 --> 23:16.426
Mary Pearce is dead.

23:22.231 --> 23:26.200
Mary was a wonderful woman.

23:26.202 --> 23:28.536
I used to love to watch
her dance, you know?

23:28.538 --> 23:33.574
Sometimes it looked like
she'd short-circuited.

23:33.576 --> 23:36.344
She was so full of life.

23:36.346 --> 23:39.547
Until she was dead.

23:39.549 --> 23:45.053
But yet, there were moments
of stillness and...

23:45.055 --> 23:50.424
no talking when she was asleep.

23:50.426 --> 23:53.194
Mostly.

23:53.196 --> 23:58.299
And in the end
she lost her head.

23:58.301 --> 24:02.170
Dementia.

24:02.172 --> 24:04.338
She left us years ago.

24:04.340 --> 24:07.676
I'm just so sad that
I never got to meet her.

24:07.678 --> 24:08.677
No, I'm vegan.

24:08.679 --> 24:11.345
So to whom did the house belong?

24:11.347 --> 24:12.581
- The house?
- It's number 66.

24:12.583 --> 24:13.449
We went there before.

24:13.451 --> 24:14.749
I know it's a little bit
Myra Hindley...

24:14.751 --> 24:17.786
You have no business there.

24:17.788 --> 24:21.222
The house belongs
to the village now.

24:21.224 --> 24:24.026
I'm sorry you've come
all this way for nothing

24:24.028 --> 24:28.330
but really it's time for you
to be leaving now.

24:28.332 --> 24:30.164
I spoke to her.

24:31.468 --> 24:33.567
Daisy.

24:33.569 --> 24:37.541
Go and help your uncle
with the sheets.

24:39.542 --> 24:42.710
When did you speak with her?

24:42.712 --> 24:44.779
On the phone,
just before we left.

24:44.781 --> 24:47.783
You said she died years ago.

24:47.785 --> 24:50.218
Emotionally.

24:50.220 --> 24:51.719
Her brain.

24:51.721 --> 24:55.056
Her body gave way yesterday.

24:55.058 --> 24:58.226
Well, I'd like to see her.

24:58.228 --> 24:59.326
To pay our respects.

24:59.328 --> 25:00.694
She's dead, mate.

25:00.696 --> 25:02.663
Then when's the funeral?

25:02.665 --> 25:07.302
The funeral is tomorrow.

25:07.304 --> 25:10.171
You must come, of course.

25:10.173 --> 25:12.609
Will you excuse me now.

25:20.584 --> 25:22.484
You're lucky we had space.

25:22.486 --> 25:23.352
Gets very busy,

25:23.354 --> 25:24.819
what with the Australia Day
ceremony.

25:24.821 --> 25:27.555
Oh, what's that?

25:27.557 --> 25:29.490
Only the most important,
incredible and exciting day

25:29.492 --> 25:31.660
of the year.

25:31.662 --> 25:35.497
And there's karaoke.

25:35.499 --> 25:39.334
We're doing the funeral,
and that's final!

25:42.673 --> 25:43.638
Gidday.

25:43.640 --> 25:45.574
Gidday!

25:51.647 --> 25:54.149
Shall I get them
some Meaty-Mite?

25:54.151 --> 25:56.617
Is that like Marmite?

25:56.619 --> 25:58.253
No.

25:58.255 --> 26:01.155
I don't consume meat products.

26:01.157 --> 26:02.524
What do you want, then?

26:02.526 --> 26:03.525
An onion?

26:04.595 --> 26:06.428
Well maybe in a salad.

26:06.430 --> 26:08.332
We don't do salad.

26:10.634 --> 26:12.502
Give them the stew.

26:15.506 --> 26:16.403
Norman.

26:16.405 --> 26:17.605
Annabelle.

26:17.607 --> 26:19.474
Welcome home.

26:19.476 --> 26:21.709
We are so sorry for your loss.

26:21.711 --> 26:23.411
Mary was like family.

26:23.413 --> 26:25.747
She gave everything
to the community.

26:25.749 --> 26:27.215
Noah!

26:27.217 --> 26:29.484
Do not mansplain over me.

26:29.486 --> 26:32.520
It is my right as a woman
not be interrupted!

26:32.522 --> 26:33.787
We thought you were dead!

26:33.789 --> 26:36.324
But we are thrilled that
that is not the case.

26:36.326 --> 26:37.625
Eric.

26:37.627 --> 26:38.927
My first born.

26:38.929 --> 26:40.528
Uncle Morris, my father.

26:40.530 --> 26:42.463
Fuck off, ya pommy bastards!

26:43.333 --> 26:45.267
He likes you.

26:45.269 --> 26:48.338
And this is Jayne,
our pride and joy.

26:50.473 --> 26:53.208
And your biggest fan.

26:53.210 --> 26:55.911
We use your stuff every day.

26:55.913 --> 26:58.513
Well don't you have lovely hair.

27:07.356 --> 27:08.422
Jayne.

27:08.424 --> 27:09.391
With a Y.

27:09.393 --> 27:11.461
She's very particular
about the spelling.

27:22.705 --> 27:24.738
You two need a drink.

27:24.740 --> 27:27.741
We've got, ah, Beaujolais,
Shiraz and Chianti.

27:27.743 --> 27:29.411
But that'll cost you extra.

27:29.413 --> 27:30.578
What, before dinner?

27:30.580 --> 27:32.247
If he's a man,
he'll have a XXXX.

27:32.249 --> 27:33.515
What's a XXXX?

27:33.517 --> 27:34.548
It's a man's drink.

27:47.830 --> 27:51.232
Oh, goes down like a fat kid
on a see-saw.

27:51.234 --> 27:53.904
Well, I'll have one of those.

28:16.926 --> 28:19.760
Looks like Mary's prodigy's
got a vagina.

28:19.762 --> 28:21.662
No, he doesn't.

28:21.664 --> 28:23.864
But I do.

28:23.866 --> 28:25.734
Pass me one of those.

28:38.815 --> 28:41.016
That's how it's done, boys.

28:41.018 --> 28:42.284
Impressive.

28:42.286 --> 28:44.518
I like to have a drink
with Anna

28:44.520 --> 28:46.888
'Cause Anna's me mate!

28:49.358 --> 28:52.594
She drinks it down in eight,
seven, six, five,

28:52.596 --> 28:54.895
four, three, two, one!

29:02.838 --> 29:04.975
Grub's up.

29:11.815 --> 29:13.284
Um.

29:14.718 --> 29:16.019
Hmm.

29:17.554 --> 29:20.055
That's really good.

29:20.057 --> 29:23.391
It's sort of smoking.

29:23.393 --> 29:24.659
You sure
you don't want any of this?

29:24.661 --> 29:26.894
Fuck it, give me the stew.

29:26.896 --> 29:27.964
Give me the stew...

29:36.940 --> 29:38.643
- Oh, it's sublime.
- Isn't it?

29:41.845 --> 29:42.943
What is it?
It's so sweet.

29:42.945 --> 29:43.812
It's so tender.

29:43.814 --> 29:44.845
I think it's...

29:44.847 --> 29:47.349
Well I think it's veal.

29:47.351 --> 29:48.749
It's baby cow?

29:48.751 --> 29:50.884
Oh, that's really bad,
isn't it?

29:53.757 --> 29:55.489
What?

29:55.491 --> 29:57.825
Remember that weekend
that Mum took us to that place,

29:57.827 --> 29:58.893
was it in Bournemouth?

29:58.895 --> 30:00.428
Oh yes,
our first and final holiday.

30:00.430 --> 30:01.296
And I dared you to...

30:01.298 --> 30:02.997
To eat 70 chicken nuggets
on the pier.

30:02.999 --> 30:06.101
Yes, I do remember, thank you.

30:06.103 --> 30:07.835
You lost five pounds that day.

30:07.837 --> 30:10.572
You gained 10.

30:10.574 --> 30:12.673
Do you know I got the worst
food poisoning ever that day.

30:21.550 --> 30:23.617
Ooh.

30:29.893 --> 30:30.691
Don't forget to flush!

30:30.693 --> 30:32.459
Oh, you're not funny!

30:51.815 --> 30:55.083
They could put the
whole operation in danger.

30:55.085 --> 30:57.552
Everything we've worked for.

30:57.554 --> 31:00.087
I will take care of it.

31:00.089 --> 31:04.092
They will leave
after the funeral.

31:04.094 --> 31:07.027
But we've never done a funeral.

31:07.029 --> 31:08.595
You'll be fine.

31:24.614 --> 31:27.015
Daisy?

31:27.017 --> 31:29.651
Do you want me
to wash your wombat?

31:29.653 --> 31:31.119
Beg your pardon?

31:31.121 --> 31:34.021
Your toy wombat.

31:34.023 --> 31:36.623
This is...

31:36.625 --> 31:37.691
a wombat.

31:37.693 --> 31:39.693
Right.

31:39.695 --> 31:42.764
I mean, it's not mine.

31:42.766 --> 31:43.832
It's my sister's.

31:43.834 --> 31:45.866
She's really immature, so...

31:45.868 --> 31:47.235
Mary.

31:47.237 --> 31:50.604
The day she arrived
in Australia.

31:50.606 --> 31:52.207
She looks so happy.

31:52.209 --> 31:56.110
Oh, that was before the family
took back control of the farm.

31:56.112 --> 31:57.911
She owned a farm?

31:57.913 --> 32:00.648
She was a very hard worker.

32:00.650 --> 32:04.084
Wish I'd got the chance
to meet her.

32:04.086 --> 32:06.123
Thank you, for this.

32:08.959 --> 32:10.561
I like your haircut.

32:27.844 --> 32:29.943
So Anna, it turns out
Mary came here as an immigrant.

32:29.945 --> 32:32.881
She owned this farm,
and Mr Mateusz is a wombat...

33:32.241 --> 33:35.278
Pommy bastard snag killer!

33:43.118 --> 33:47.287
Soft,
gentle music helps you calm your mind.

33:50.093 --> 33:52.293
- Who's this?
- That's enough, Morris.

33:52.295 --> 33:53.995
He'll bring the curse!

33:55.230 --> 33:57.364
This used to be his room.

33:57.366 --> 33:58.766
What, so he stuck a fork in me?

33:58.768 --> 33:59.767
A fork!

33:59.769 --> 34:01.235
Oh, calm down.

34:01.237 --> 34:02.870
It's only a flesh wound.

34:09.746 --> 34:12.047
You've got your mother's legs.

34:14.884 --> 34:16.152
That's quite a big needle.

34:26.862 --> 34:28.027
- Doesn't hurt, does it?
- No.

34:28.030 --> 34:29.666
Oh, no no.

34:34.003 --> 34:36.204
You should stay away
from Morris.

34:36.206 --> 34:39.273
He called me a snag killer.

34:39.275 --> 34:40.108
What does that mean?

34:40.110 --> 34:43.210
A snag means sausage.

34:43.213 --> 34:45.213
He just blames you
for the plague.

34:45.215 --> 34:46.114
What plague?

34:48.251 --> 34:56.627
Apparently when you were born
all the pigs just sort of died.

34:58.027 --> 35:00.293
Morris said you cursed
the village.

35:00.295 --> 35:03.032
But everyone knew
the real reason.

35:20.916 --> 35:23.784
It was safer to send you away.

35:23.786 --> 35:24.885
And tell everyone we were dead.

35:24.887 --> 35:26.354
Why wouldn't she go with us?

35:29.391 --> 35:32.392
You ask too many
questions, Norman.

35:32.394 --> 35:34.295
Wait there,
I'll fetch the scissors.

35:34.297 --> 35:35.965
No need.

35:41.704 --> 35:44.072
It's lucky he missed
my femoral artery.

35:44.074 --> 35:45.072
Well, where's that?

35:45.074 --> 35:48.709
Oh, it's just there.

35:48.711 --> 35:51.045
If he'd cut it, I'd be dead
in about five minutes.

35:51.047 --> 35:53.313
Five minutes?

35:53.315 --> 35:54.382
Well that's not long.

35:54.384 --> 35:59.019
But the one to really get
is the subclavian artery.

35:59.021 --> 36:02.956
One jab there, I'd bleed out
in about five seconds.

36:02.958 --> 36:04.726
I did it to a pig once.

36:04.728 --> 36:06.059
Well, I didn't, my Mum did.

36:06.061 --> 36:07.394
Other Mum.

36:07.396 --> 36:09.097
I just watched.

36:09.099 --> 36:10.164
I like...

36:10.166 --> 36:12.400
I like pigs.

36:12.402 --> 36:13.767
I should go.

36:13.769 --> 36:15.271
Yup.

36:50.106 --> 36:53.775
Oh gosh,
it feels like my brain's eating my skull.

36:53.777 --> 36:55.311
How did you sleep?

37:20.836 --> 37:22.537
- Morris.
- Yeah.

37:22.539 --> 37:24.074
Yeah.

37:43.126 --> 37:44.027
Ladies and...

37:49.231 --> 37:51.164
Thanks, Morris.

37:51.166 --> 37:55.202
Ladies and gentlemen
today is Australia Day.

37:55.204 --> 37:57.338
- Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!
- Oi oi oi!

37:57.340 --> 38:01.141
- Aussie, Aussie, Aussie!
- Oi oi oi!

38:01.143 --> 38:04.045
But it's a funeral,
so sad, also.

38:04.047 --> 38:08.117
Mary was a woman.

38:12.054 --> 38:14.287
And she was old.

38:14.289 --> 38:16.490
And she's dead.

38:20.396 --> 38:22.195
Why don't we look
at some pictures of Mary

38:22.197 --> 38:23.164
when she was alive?

38:23.166 --> 38:24.334
Thank you, Eric.

38:28.304 --> 38:29.604
No.

38:29.606 --> 38:30.908
No, that's the wrong picture.

38:34.543 --> 38:35.945
Shit.

38:43.018 --> 38:44.120
Oh no.

38:46.655 --> 38:48.889
No, let's pull the pin
on the pictures, thanks Eric.

38:48.891 --> 38:52.360
Would anyone like to say
some words about Mary?

38:52.362 --> 38:54.996
Anyone at all?

38:54.998 --> 38:57.331
Morris, you took over her farm.

38:57.333 --> 38:58.298
You got to know her.

38:58.300 --> 38:59.467
What would you say about her?

38:59.469 --> 39:01.001
Fuckin' bitch.

39:01.003 --> 39:02.239
And may she rest in peace.

39:04.440 --> 39:06.440
That concludes the service.

39:06.442 --> 39:08.378
Sandwiches under the tarp.

39:18.987 --> 39:22.058
Are you gonna say something
to put her body to rest?

39:23.626 --> 39:25.596
Ja, of course.

39:27.697 --> 39:29.963

40:37.333 --> 40:40.066
I think she was under threat.

40:42.070 --> 40:45.639
The bus leaves in 15 minutes.

40:45.641 --> 40:49.275
I'm sure Mary is proud of you
wherever she is.

41:12.434 --> 41:15.469
Say bye bye, pommies!

41:15.471 --> 41:16.539
Jumping!

41:22.577 --> 41:24.711
- Would you just get off me!
- Shh! Shh!

41:24.713 --> 41:26.416
Be quiet!
Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet.

41:35.657 --> 41:37.527
That's the man from immigration.

41:43.398 --> 41:45.432
- He's in on it.
- In on what?

41:45.434 --> 41:47.137
I don't know,
but I'm gonna find out.

41:51.474 --> 41:53.074
What, are you going
to leave your teddy bear behind,

41:53.076 --> 41:54.775
are you Normie?

41:54.777 --> 41:58.248
His name is Mr Mateusz
and he's a wombat.

42:03.318 --> 42:05.786
Bastard went off like a frog
in a sock

42:05.788 --> 42:08.555
and then was off like
a bride's nightie.

42:08.557 --> 42:10.124
Kong Dang?

42:10.126 --> 42:13.860
My friend became angry
and then made a swift exit.

42:13.862 --> 42:15.528
Bonza.
Good boy, good boy.

42:15.530 --> 42:17.034
Oi, Morris.

42:19.434 --> 42:20.668
Pommies.

42:20.670 --> 42:21.469
Why don't you tell me
what really happened

42:21.471 --> 42:24.137
- to my mother?
- She's cactus.

42:24.139 --> 42:25.171
What?

42:25.173 --> 42:27.273
She's no longer alive.

42:27.275 --> 42:28.842
Okay.

42:28.844 --> 42:29.844
And how did she die?

42:29.846 --> 42:32.112
- Lost her noggin.
- Head.

42:32.114 --> 42:33.581
Now fuck off.

42:33.583 --> 42:34.481
Please leave.

42:34.483 --> 42:34.916
Come on, Norman,
this is clearly point...

42:34.918 --> 42:37.217
Wait, hang on.

42:37.219 --> 42:39.353
Answer me this and I'll go.

42:39.355 --> 42:40.753
Mary had white hair, yes?

42:40.755 --> 42:42.289
Nah yeah.

42:42.291 --> 42:43.624
What?

42:43.626 --> 42:45.358
Nah yeah means yes.

42:45.360 --> 42:47.161
Right.

42:47.163 --> 42:49.896
But I saw that the body
in the coffin had black hair.

42:49.898 --> 42:51.365
Yeah nah.

42:51.367 --> 42:52.499
So it couldn't have been
the same person.

42:52.501 --> 42:54.869
Yeah nah!

42:54.871 --> 42:56.470
Yeah nah means no.

42:56.472 --> 42:58.238
Oh, my head hurts.

42:58.240 --> 42:59.606
Australian is
a language incredibly rich

42:59.608 --> 43:01.742
in idiomatic expression.

43:01.744 --> 43:02.909
Was that her in the coffin?

43:02.911 --> 43:04.677
- Yeah nah or nah yeah?
- Yeah nah.

43:04.679 --> 43:06.213
- Yeah nah?
- Yeah nah.

43:06.215 --> 43:06.880
- Nah yeah?
- Nah.

43:06.882 --> 43:08.349
Nah, nah yeah.

43:08.351 --> 43:09.282
Yeah nah?

43:09.284 --> 43:10.918
Nah.

43:10.920 --> 43:12.019
- I knew it.
- You knew what?

43:12.021 --> 43:17.458
Pig murdering ankle-biting
pommy bastard arsehole!

43:17.460 --> 43:22.195
That one is not listed.

43:22.197 --> 43:23.796
What the hell is going on?

43:23.798 --> 43:25.733
If we miss this bus...

43:25.735 --> 43:28.202
She had white hair and look.

43:28.204 --> 43:29.702
No tattoo on the wrist.

43:29.704 --> 43:31.271
That's her.

43:31.273 --> 43:32.572
Who gave you this?

43:32.574 --> 43:34.307
Nobody.

43:34.309 --> 43:35.275
Daisy.

43:36.246 --> 43:38.646
Oh my God, you fancy
the little freckle girl?

43:38.648 --> 43:40.380
She looks about 10.

43:40.382 --> 43:42.516
I don't fancy anyone.

43:42.518 --> 43:43.383
You're like Rolf Harris.

43:43.385 --> 43:44.450
Have you no shame?

43:44.452 --> 43:46.452
Can we stay on topic, please?

43:46.454 --> 43:48.255
These people have done
something to our mother.

43:48.257 --> 43:49.190
Oh, no they haven't.

43:49.192 --> 43:50.958
Yes they have, Anna,
and I will prove it.

43:50.960 --> 43:53.130
And how do you plan
on doing that?

44:05.942 --> 44:08.374
It's the heat.

44:08.376 --> 44:10.510
The heat is driving you mad.

44:10.512 --> 44:11.345
Please stop.

44:11.347 --> 44:13.646
You're going to anger
the locals.

44:13.648 --> 44:14.784
Then let's anger them.

44:35.304 --> 44:35.970
Hans must be hiding her.

44:35.972 --> 44:37.070
We should check the pub.

44:37.072 --> 44:39.505
No amount of money is worth
risking our lives for.

44:39.507 --> 44:40.907
What, is that why
you came here?

44:40.909 --> 44:42.775
For money?

44:42.777 --> 44:44.411
Of course.

44:44.413 --> 44:46.579
What, do you think I care about
some Australian crone

44:46.581 --> 44:49.349
who gave me up at birth
and then pretended I was dead?

44:49.351 --> 44:51.485
Anna, I think
she was doing it for us.

44:51.487 --> 44:53.954
I think she was doing it
for herself.

44:53.956 --> 44:55.825
I'm just taking a leaf
out of her book.

45:00.563 --> 45:01.795
You said family meant
sticking together

45:01.797 --> 45:03.699
no matter what.

45:04.900 --> 45:07.001
Razem.

45:28.456 --> 45:30.226
Think you're gonna
love Australia Day.

45:32.961 --> 45:35.329
We try to cater
to everyone's tastes.

45:35.331 --> 45:38.632
It's very inclusive.

45:38.634 --> 45:39.932
So just through here.

45:39.934 --> 45:41.467
Yep, mind your step.

46:04.893 --> 46:06.860
That's exactly
what I said to her.

46:06.862 --> 46:08.762
No, I like him.

46:08.764 --> 46:11.565
Oh, stop it.
You can be so judgemental!

46:11.567 --> 46:13.566
I'm not having this argument
with you again.

46:13.568 --> 46:15.538
Just be quiet
and eat your salad.

46:18.340 --> 46:19.505
Oh.

46:19.507 --> 46:20.374
Oh.

46:20.376 --> 46:21.108
Oh.

46:21.110 --> 46:23.376
It's not what it looks like.

46:23.378 --> 46:26.045
Did... did you do this
to my mother?

46:26.047 --> 46:27.613
No!

46:27.615 --> 46:28.382
No.

46:28.384 --> 46:29.083
God, no.

46:29.085 --> 46:31.351
I would never do that to Mary.

46:31.353 --> 46:33.586
Please don't tell my Mum
about this.

46:33.588 --> 46:34.857
Then tell me where Mary is.

46:36.958 --> 46:39.959
My Mum says I can't.

46:39.961 --> 46:42.829
Don't you think
I won't go straight to Apple

46:42.831 --> 46:44.998
and tell her...

46:45.000 --> 46:47.403
Not entirely sure what this is,
but I will tell her.

46:51.072 --> 46:52.972
She was found trying
to leave the village

46:52.974 --> 46:54.641
and Hans wasn't happy.

46:54.643 --> 46:55.842
Why?

46:55.844 --> 46:57.911
Because...

46:57.913 --> 46:59.782
Because nobody leaves
the village.

47:01.916 --> 47:04.517
Son!

47:04.519 --> 47:06.887
Quickly, in here.

47:06.889 --> 47:08.988
Come on.

47:08.990 --> 47:10.626
Come on.

47:14.163 --> 47:15.597
Sorry, darling.

47:19.835 --> 47:21.901
Why are you starkers?

47:21.903 --> 47:23.970
I was doing Pilates.

47:23.972 --> 47:25.909
For my circulation.

47:28.143 --> 47:30.010
Mum said tonight.

47:30.012 --> 47:31.845
We do it tonight.

47:31.847 --> 47:33.679
Do what?

47:33.681 --> 47:35.516
The thing.

47:35.518 --> 47:36.617
What's the thing?

47:36.619 --> 47:39.086
Take control.

47:39.088 --> 47:41.188
Just cover up your donger.

47:41.190 --> 47:42.889
Love you!

48:22.697 --> 48:24.965
No smoking inside.

48:24.967 --> 48:26.503
Well open a window, then.

48:31.507 --> 48:32.805
Emergency services.

48:32.807 --> 48:33.840
Police.

48:33.842 --> 48:35.809
Yeah, what's your location?

48:35.811 --> 48:37.079
Two Heads Creek.

48:52.695 --> 48:53.827
Mary?

49:19.621 --> 49:20.987
It's no use, sister girl.

49:20.989 --> 49:23.155
It's a government operation.

49:23.157 --> 49:25.659
Lots of money involved.

49:25.661 --> 49:28.762
They pay the town to make
the immigrant problem disappear.

49:28.764 --> 49:31.697
Nobody hears the screams.

49:31.699 --> 49:34.603
You're the first one
I've ever seen come back.

49:46.981 --> 49:49.583
Look, we're doing the
Australia Day celebration.

49:49.585 --> 49:51.221
If he doesn't like it,
we'll get rid of him.

51:01.090 --> 51:03.856
I can't believe
it's finally here!

51:03.858 --> 51:05.626
Will she be ready
for the feast?

51:05.628 --> 51:07.163
Ah yeah, yeah of course.

51:09.331 --> 51:10.697
Wow.

51:10.699 --> 51:12.766
The BigBoy 3000.

51:12.768 --> 51:13.800
Secondhand.

51:13.802 --> 51:15.702
Oh, made in China,

51:15.704 --> 51:16.670
but we won't hold that
against her.

51:17.206 --> 51:19.139
Beaut.

51:19.141 --> 51:20.773
Does she turn on?

51:20.775 --> 51:22.742
Yeah.

51:22.744 --> 51:24.144
Why don't you give her a
go, son?

51:24.146 --> 51:26.847
Oh, can I?

51:26.849 --> 51:27.847
Yeah, go for your life.

51:27.849 --> 51:29.182
Oh really?

51:29.184 --> 51:30.687
Thanks.

51:35.990 --> 51:38.360
Oh, this is great!

51:50.005 --> 51:51.237
Shit.

51:51.239 --> 51:52.341
I need to...

51:55.010 --> 51:57.911
You need to plug it in first.

51:57.913 --> 52:00.282
Aye, that'd be the reason.

52:02.384 --> 52:06.019
Oh, why did you put the BigBoy
so far from the plug?

52:06.021 --> 52:08.454
It's called Feng Shui, Eric.

52:08.456 --> 52:11.691
Look, the grinder's here
so we're doing the feast, right?

52:11.693 --> 52:14.126
Well, Hans?

52:14.128 --> 52:16.063
- We postpone.
- Oh.

52:16.065 --> 52:17.898
On Australia Day?

52:17.900 --> 52:19.465
We haven't cancelled
an Australia Day celebration

52:19.467 --> 52:21.200
since the Great Famine.

52:21.202 --> 52:23.170
Yeah,
and what about the karaoke?

52:23.172 --> 52:25.037
I am the Chair.

52:25.039 --> 52:26.907
The Chair has spoken.

52:26.909 --> 52:29.275
Yeah, but I've spent weeks
on the colour scheme.

52:29.277 --> 52:32.045
It will still go ahead,
fear not.

52:32.047 --> 52:34.447
I'll get rid of Norman myself.

52:34.449 --> 52:36.316
That's what you said
when the pigs all died.

52:36.318 --> 52:37.950
You lied to us then.

52:37.952 --> 52:40.253
What's to say
you're telling the truth now?

52:40.255 --> 52:44.191
Need I remind you,
little brother

52:44.193 --> 52:46.459
that father chose me.

52:46.461 --> 52:48.894
Yeah, and you chose democracy.

52:48.896 --> 52:50.831
That accent's not
the only thing you brought back

52:50.833 --> 52:52.865
from your one summer
in Dusseldorf.

52:52.867 --> 52:54.867
The curse remains.

52:54.869 --> 52:58.438
Our community is under threat
from outsiders.

52:58.440 --> 53:01.941
We need strong
and decisive leadership.

53:01.943 --> 53:03.012
What was that?

53:10.251 --> 53:12.251
The spring roll's gone
walkabout.

53:20.762 --> 53:22.030
Oh-hoo!

53:25.300 --> 53:26.499
Come on!

53:26.501 --> 53:28.168
Border control, bitch!

53:35.811 --> 53:38.278
Fuck yeah!

53:38.280 --> 53:39.912
Hope you've had your Weet-Bix.

53:52.027 --> 53:54.260
And I was never
allowed to sit in the front seat.

53:54.262 --> 53:56.896
I mean, can you imagine
what that did to my self-esteem?

53:56.898 --> 53:58.063
Always being put second.

53:58.065 --> 54:00.032
Always playing
a supporting role.

54:00.034 --> 54:01.867
I mean, no wonder
I became an actress.

54:01.869 --> 54:03.936
I mean how was I,
an innocent child

54:03.938 --> 54:06.072
supposed to form
a positive sense of self

54:06.074 --> 54:09.309
in a regime of systemic,
sadistic,

54:09.311 --> 54:14.481
I mean emotionally manipulative,
cross-projecting abuse?

54:14.483 --> 54:16.316
I was put in an orphanage
after the police

54:16.318 --> 54:18.584
murdered my mother and father
in front of me

54:18.586 --> 54:20.487
which would explain
why I couldn't get a job,

54:20.489 --> 54:23.023
due to lack of qualifications
and skills.

54:23.025 --> 54:25.057
I had to steal tinned food
to support my daughter,

54:25.059 --> 54:26.525
then the government
took her away

54:26.527 --> 54:28.360
and now I'm stuck here
doing this job

54:28.362 --> 54:31.032
until I can get a court case
to get custody back.

54:32.967 --> 54:35.367
Yes, exactly.

54:35.369 --> 54:38.271
But hey, you'd do anything
for family, right?

54:44.880 --> 54:46.112
Mary?

55:10.072 --> 55:11.905
Daisy.

55:11.907 --> 55:13.373
Behind you.

55:34.496 --> 55:36.362
Leave him out here to rot.

55:36.364 --> 55:37.599
Yes, Daddy.

58:41.182 --> 58:42.347
Bazza!
Trev!

58:42.349 --> 58:43.483
Keep your eye on the grub.

58:43.485 --> 58:44.753
Come on!

58:49.824 --> 58:51.426
Bye, Norman.

59:07.442 --> 59:08.874
We should have bought a Kenwood.

59:08.876 --> 59:10.709
That's not helpful, Eric.

59:10.711 --> 59:13.378
Right, we need a...
let's see if we can find a...

59:13.380 --> 59:14.716
Anyone see a right wingnut?

59:45.614 --> 59:47.146
Hey, Jayne?

59:47.148 --> 59:48.784
How do you spell
pasty little bitch?

01:00:00.195 --> 01:00:02.795
You've let me down
you've let yourself down

01:00:02.797 --> 01:00:05.264
and you've let
our daughter down.

01:00:05.266 --> 01:00:06.865
Where is Jayne?

01:00:06.867 --> 01:00:08.200
Jayne!

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:13.673
You chose family.

01:00:13.675 --> 01:00:18.577
No, you can't choose
your family.

01:00:18.579 --> 01:00:20.115
Razem.

01:00:25.887 --> 01:00:26.753
We need to call the police.

01:00:26.755 --> 01:00:28.287
No, look,
it's a government operation.

01:00:28.289 --> 01:00:29.354
Eating immigrants?

01:00:29.356 --> 01:00:31.456
This country is fucked.

01:00:31.458 --> 01:00:32.691
Now look, I found a car
round the front.

01:00:32.693 --> 01:00:33.693
Wait.

01:00:33.695 --> 01:00:34.526
They've got Daisy.

01:00:34.528 --> 01:00:35.494
There's no time.

01:00:35.496 --> 01:00:36.929
Jayne!

01:00:36.931 --> 01:00:38.666
Norman, please.

01:00:43.237 --> 01:00:44.403
Jayne!

01:00:54.548 --> 01:00:55.682
Oh, come on, let's go.

01:00:55.684 --> 01:00:56.483
Go back.
Go back.

01:00:56.485 --> 01:00:57.416
No, no, no,
it's too dangerous.

01:00:57.418 --> 01:00:58.650
It's too dangerous,
it's too dangerous.

01:00:58.652 --> 01:01:00.220
Wait, wait, look!

01:01:14.268 --> 01:01:15.837
Tear them apart!

01:01:18.306 --> 01:01:18.874
Right.

01:01:20.976 --> 01:01:22.641
Car!
Car, car, car!

01:01:31.418 --> 01:01:33.418
I have literally no idea
how to drive.

01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:34.720
Are you joking?

01:01:34.722 --> 01:01:35.724
Oh God!

01:01:48.003 --> 01:01:49.371
Get them!

01:01:50.605 --> 01:01:51.639
Anna.

01:01:55.443 --> 01:01:57.276
What's happening?

01:01:57.278 --> 01:01:57.980
Come on now!

01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:00.746
Anna, they're coming.

01:02:00.748 --> 01:02:01.481
I know that they're coming.

01:02:01.483 --> 01:02:02.414
I can see that they are coming.

01:02:02.416 --> 01:02:03.682
Get it!

01:02:03.684 --> 01:02:04.552
Follow me!

01:02:10.525 --> 01:02:11.824
Right, quick!
Chase 'em!

01:02:11.826 --> 01:02:13.561
- Come on!
- Come on, Dad!

01:02:16.731 --> 01:02:18.567
Come here, little piggies!

01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:28.710
I'm gonna bite off
his tiny English cock!

01:02:31.713 --> 01:02:32.815
Anna?

01:02:36.384 --> 01:02:38.950
Anna, where are you?

01:02:38.952 --> 01:02:42.521
You're not leaving
without your teddy.

01:02:42.523 --> 01:02:44.456
He's a wombat.

01:02:44.458 --> 01:02:47.559
He's a child's plaything,
Norman.

01:02:47.561 --> 01:02:48.963
So what does that make you?

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.032
Mateusz!

01:02:58.440 --> 01:02:59.972
Oh, what's the matter
with you people?

01:02:59.974 --> 01:03:01.507
What's wrong with chicken?

01:03:01.509 --> 01:03:03.376
Work with me, Norman.

01:03:03.378 --> 01:03:05.077
And we can defeat Apple.

01:03:05.079 --> 01:03:05.912
Defeat Apple?

01:03:05.914 --> 01:03:07.113
You're the one trying
to kill us.

01:03:07.115 --> 01:03:11.684
No, they tried to kill me
because I'm trying to save you.

01:03:11.686 --> 01:03:13.753
We're not so different,
you and I.

01:03:13.755 --> 01:03:15.588
Oh really?

01:03:15.590 --> 01:03:16.555
Because the
last time I checked,

01:03:16.557 --> 01:03:19.992
I haven't eaten a ragu
made of human arse!

01:03:19.994 --> 01:03:23.729
But you really enjoyed
last night's dinner, didn't you?

01:03:23.731 --> 01:03:25.865
You can thank your mother
for that.

01:03:25.867 --> 01:03:28.467
You mean I ate my mother?

01:03:28.469 --> 01:03:29.836
Ate her?

01:03:29.838 --> 01:03:30.802
In the stew.

01:03:30.804 --> 01:03:32.572
You said so yourself.

01:03:32.574 --> 01:03:34.139
No, that was someone else.

01:03:34.141 --> 01:03:37.043
It was just
your mother's recipe.

01:03:37.045 --> 01:03:39.081
I would never eat my own wife.

01:03:40.882 --> 01:03:42.581
Wife?

01:03:42.583 --> 01:03:45.751
I loved her with all my heart.

01:03:45.753 --> 01:03:47.653
No.

01:03:47.655 --> 01:03:50.389
Ja, Norman.

01:03:50.391 --> 01:03:51.726
I am your...

01:03:57.065 --> 01:03:58.664
I should...

01:04:17.818 --> 01:04:19.121
Who is she?

01:04:21.489 --> 01:04:23.555
She's our mother.

01:04:23.557 --> 01:04:25.458
Mama bear!

01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:28.094
Where are you?

01:04:28.096 --> 01:04:29.896
Come on babies.

01:04:42.577 --> 01:04:44.443
Gabby was my best friend.

01:04:44.445 --> 01:04:47.713
Oh, I couldn't believe it
when you answered the phone.

01:04:47.715 --> 01:04:49.816
Oh, with such
a lovely posh voice.

01:04:49.818 --> 01:04:52.050
You'll be safe in here.

01:04:52.052 --> 01:04:55.521
I've been watching you both,
waiting to talk to youse.

01:04:55.523 --> 01:04:56.621
Never mind the smell.

01:04:56.623 --> 01:04:57.992
It's just koala piss.

01:05:01.496 --> 01:05:02.762
After you.

01:05:02.764 --> 01:05:05.231
Eric was supposed
to finish Hans off.

01:05:05.233 --> 01:05:07.499
Are you okay,
my little echidna?

01:05:07.501 --> 01:05:09.534
I told you to stay close!

01:05:09.536 --> 01:05:11.570
Now let's not get abusive,
Apple.

01:05:11.572 --> 01:05:13.472
I think he's only trying
to be empathetic.

01:05:13.474 --> 01:05:15.541
I'm not being abusive,
I'm being assertive.

01:05:15.543 --> 01:05:17.043
Well, I think you're projecting.

01:05:17.045 --> 01:05:18.778
I'm really starting to regret
giving you

01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:20.916
that counselling DVD
for Christmas, Clive.

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:27.753
Mary.

01:05:27.755 --> 01:05:29.822
Hans must have kept her alive.

01:05:29.824 --> 01:05:32.525
Fucking Germans.

01:05:32.527 --> 01:05:35.193
If they escape,
they could blow the whole thing.

01:05:35.195 --> 01:05:37.095
They wouldn't dare.

01:05:37.097 --> 01:05:39.065
We've got something they want.

01:05:47.275 --> 01:05:49.842
That's your cue to follow me,
you morons!

01:05:49.844 --> 01:05:51.012
- Right.
- Yes, good.

01:06:15.603 --> 01:06:17.206
Oh God.

01:06:28.583 --> 01:06:30.251
Anna, look.

01:06:41.061 --> 01:06:42.964
Okay, so it is lesbian, then.

01:06:45.599 --> 01:06:46.731
Sit down.

01:06:46.733 --> 01:06:47.735
Sit.

01:06:50.137 --> 01:06:53.674
I can't believe I'm going
to see you eat your first grub.

01:06:57.778 --> 01:06:59.780
You first, Normie.

01:07:06.119 --> 01:07:07.353
Ha!

01:07:07.355 --> 01:07:08.820
You're like your Dad.

01:07:08.822 --> 01:07:10.125
He loved his grubs.

01:07:14.896 --> 01:07:16.963
What's wrong?

01:07:16.965 --> 01:07:20.199
I can't believe he's gone.

01:07:20.201 --> 01:07:22.367
We met in Dusseldorf.

01:07:22.369 --> 01:07:25.838
We got hitched and he brought me
back here to meet the relos.

01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:28.240
Oh, he was such a good man.

01:07:28.242 --> 01:07:30.675
He killed and ate people.

01:07:30.677 --> 01:07:34.679
Yeah, I know, but human flesh
is so addictive,

01:07:34.681 --> 01:07:35.947
it drives you bonkers.

01:07:35.949 --> 01:07:37.749
It's like crack.

01:07:37.751 --> 01:07:39.284
I disagree.

01:07:39.286 --> 01:07:42.121
The villagers got a taste
for it after the pigs died

01:07:42.123 --> 01:07:43.923
and they started feasting
on the deceased,

01:07:43.925 --> 01:07:46.224
but that wasn't enough.

01:07:46.226 --> 01:07:50.630
So you just stood by
and watched innocent people die.

01:07:50.632 --> 01:07:51.998
Why didn't you stand up
against them?

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.733
Why didn't you fight?

01:07:53.735 --> 01:07:55.867
Because they would have
killed Daisy.

01:07:55.869 --> 01:07:57.936
Daisy?
What do you mean, Daisy?

01:07:57.938 --> 01:08:00.171
I tried to escape with her
so many times,

01:08:00.173 --> 01:08:03.642
but Bad Apple and her gang
brought her back.

01:08:03.644 --> 01:08:06.345
Daisy was only allowed to live
because Hans pretended

01:08:06.347 --> 01:08:10.182
to execute me as punishment
and they believed him.

01:08:10.184 --> 01:08:12.351
That's why I've been
living here, alone,

01:08:12.353 --> 01:08:14.787
for so long.

01:08:14.789 --> 01:08:18.089
I'm sorry, but I'd already lost
two children.

01:08:18.091 --> 01:08:21.760
I just couldn't bear to lose
another one.

01:08:21.761 --> 01:08:22.827
Wait.

01:08:22.828 --> 01:08:25.964
That means Daisy is...

01:08:25.966 --> 01:08:28.000
Your little sister.

01:08:29.804 --> 01:08:31.770
Did you hear that,
Luke Skywalker?

01:08:31.773 --> 01:08:33.304
She's your sister.

01:08:36.711 --> 01:08:38.210
They've got her.

01:08:51.390 --> 01:08:52.692
Where's the cash?

01:08:52.694 --> 01:08:53.694
In the shed.

01:08:55.328 --> 01:08:58.731
She was stealing from Mummy.

01:08:58.733 --> 01:09:02.268
And now she's gonna burn
on the barbie.

01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:30.995
These are wet.

01:09:30.997 --> 01:09:31.696
Who wet these?

01:09:31.698 --> 01:09:33.232
- Did you wet those?
- Sorry.

01:09:33.234 --> 01:09:34.733
God, you're pathetic.

01:09:34.734 --> 01:09:36.935
- Whose side are you on?
- Yours, Mummy.

01:09:36.938 --> 01:09:38.169
Then pull down your tank top,

01:09:38.171 --> 01:09:40.174
be a man and go
and find me fire.

01:09:45.345 --> 01:09:47.513
Don't overdo it, Aps.

01:09:47.515 --> 01:09:50.281
Do not undermine me in public.

01:09:50.283 --> 01:09:52.317
Okay, there's no need
to escalate, right?

01:09:52.319 --> 01:09:55.521
Why don't we all just try
and drop the argument ball?

01:09:55.523 --> 01:09:56.222
How can I drop the ball?

01:09:56.224 --> 01:09:57.356
I never even touched the ball.

01:09:57.358 --> 01:09:58.089
He threw the ball.

01:09:58.091 --> 01:09:59.058
Alright, I'm dropping the ball.

01:09:59.060 --> 01:10:00.793
I'm dropping the ball.
The ball's dropped.

01:10:00.795 --> 01:10:03.129
What are we playing?

01:10:03.131 --> 01:10:05.901
So we're related to everyone?

01:10:07.801 --> 01:10:10.436
Nothing worse
than extended family.

01:10:10.438 --> 01:10:11.437
No!

01:10:11.439 --> 01:10:13.438
No, don't go.

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:14.973
It's a trap.

01:10:14.975 --> 01:10:18.779
Come on, we have to think.

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:26.919
Nothing.

01:10:42.869 --> 01:10:44.038
Get off me.

01:10:46.841 --> 01:10:50.342
Oi, Morris.

01:10:50.344 --> 01:10:52.413
That little piggy
is not for sale.

01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:54.979
Shit!

01:10:58.452 --> 01:10:59.418
Piggy's not for sale?

01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:02.490
What are you,
some sort of gay superhero?

01:11:04.091 --> 01:11:05.257
Oh, God.

01:11:05.259 --> 01:11:07.358
Come on.

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:08.796
Go warm up the grinder, love.

01:11:10.564 --> 01:11:12.299
I'm gonna eat his balls.

01:11:18.538 --> 01:11:20.474
Step away from my brother,
bitch.

01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:24.576
Oh, fuck!

01:11:24.578 --> 01:11:27.146
Fucking, fucking, fucking!

01:11:27.148 --> 01:11:28.483
What the fuck!

01:11:36.056 --> 01:11:37.826
Oh, Eric!

01:11:42.997 --> 01:11:44.499
Stop her, boys!

01:12:36.016 --> 01:12:37.316
Anna!
Anna!

01:12:37.318 --> 01:12:38.250
Watch out!

01:12:38.252 --> 01:12:40.619
Come here, ya vegan mole!

01:12:40.621 --> 01:12:42.090
For fuck's sake!

01:12:51.064 --> 01:12:52.099
Ow.

01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:01.473
Watch out!
Watch out!

01:13:01.475 --> 01:13:02.611
Watch out!

01:13:20.161 --> 01:13:21.462
You need more protein, love.

01:13:55.162 --> 01:13:56.562
Jesus!

01:13:56.564 --> 01:13:58.429
- Go get your sister.
- Yeah, yeah!

01:13:58.431 --> 01:13:59.600
Dad!

01:14:07.108 --> 01:14:08.677
This is for the pigs.

01:14:11.011 --> 01:14:12.079
Daisy!

01:14:14.381 --> 01:14:16.014
Norman!

01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:36.201
No! No!

01:14:36.203 --> 01:14:37.268
No, stay with me.

01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:38.370
Stay with me, stay with me.

01:14:38.372 --> 01:14:39.304
It's okay.

01:14:39.306 --> 01:14:40.975
- It's gonna be okay.
- Get back, go on!

01:14:43.344 --> 01:14:45.376
It's only a flesh wound.

01:14:45.378 --> 01:14:47.716
I've had shits done more damage.

01:14:51.551 --> 01:14:52.817
Please, I can't lose you.

01:14:52.819 --> 01:14:54.186
I've only just found you.

01:14:54.188 --> 01:14:55.620
Oh, Norm.

01:14:55.622 --> 01:14:58.389
Oh, you sweetheart.

01:14:58.391 --> 01:15:04.231
You're so proud, so determined
and just a little bit girly.

01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:16.474
Did you know that losing
my little boy

01:15:16.476 --> 01:15:18.811
well that did make me
the saddest mother

01:15:18.813 --> 01:15:20.715
in the whole world.

01:15:21.981 --> 01:15:29.821
But seeing you grow into a man
it's made me the proudest ever.

01:15:29.823 --> 01:15:31.225
Ever.

01:15:34.595 --> 01:15:35.563
Norman!

01:15:38.332 --> 01:15:39.598
Go on.

01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:41.169
You know what to do.

01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:44.436
Oh, you.

01:15:44.438 --> 01:15:45.407
Go on.

01:15:57.118 --> 01:15:59.684
God, I love the way
you tie people up.

01:15:59.686 --> 01:16:01.320
Only for you, Mama bear.

01:16:01.322 --> 01:16:02.854
Why do we ever fight?

01:16:02.856 --> 01:16:04.192
I don't know.

01:16:07.694 --> 01:16:08.729
Let her go.

01:16:13.199 --> 01:16:16.869
One more step
and I'll mince her.

01:16:16.871 --> 01:16:18.840
Put your weapons down.

01:16:23.344 --> 01:16:24.910
Did you really think
you could come back here

01:16:24.912 --> 01:16:28.347
with your dirty blood
and destroy what we've built?

01:16:28.349 --> 01:16:29.751
This is Australia.

01:16:34.488 --> 01:16:35.821
Tie them up, baby.

01:16:35.823 --> 01:16:38.924
You know what it does to me.

01:16:38.926 --> 01:16:42.393
Let me see your hands,
you pommy prick.

01:16:42.395 --> 01:16:43.896
No.

01:16:43.898 --> 01:16:45.664
Norman, I really don't think
this is the time

01:16:45.666 --> 01:16:47.368
to discover bravery.

01:16:52.372 --> 01:16:54.608
I've had tapeworms bigger
than those arms, mate.

01:17:20.935 --> 01:17:23.869
And the pig dies in five,

01:17:23.871 --> 01:17:25.336
four,

01:17:25.338 --> 01:17:26.470
three,

01:17:26.472 --> 01:17:27.772
two,

01:17:27.774 --> 01:17:29.243
one.

01:17:31.912 --> 01:17:33.544
Baby bear!

01:17:46.226 --> 01:17:47.425
Enough.

01:17:47.427 --> 01:17:48.762
This ends now.

01:17:52.265 --> 01:17:53.665
Plug her back in.

01:17:53.667 --> 01:17:54.833
Do it!

01:18:08.948 --> 01:18:10.951
Get in, Baby Spice.

01:18:17.257 --> 01:18:18.456
Let's hope
the constipation queen

01:18:18.458 --> 01:18:19.860
doesn't clog her up.

01:18:25.632 --> 01:18:27.266
Wait.

01:18:27.268 --> 01:18:28.770
You're not stalling this time,
boy.

01:18:30.904 --> 01:18:32.271
I want to do it myself.

01:18:32.273 --> 01:18:34.305
Do you think I'm an idiot?

01:18:34.307 --> 01:18:35.874
Pass me the button.

01:18:35.876 --> 01:18:37.375
She's my family.

01:18:37.377 --> 01:18:39.577
If anyone's gonna do this,
it's me.

01:18:39.579 --> 01:18:43.048
Well there's no benefit for me
in that, I'm afraid.

01:18:43.050 --> 01:18:44.849
Then what if I ate
Annabelle instead?

01:18:44.851 --> 01:18:46.617
- What?
- What?

01:18:46.619 --> 01:18:50.488
What if I ate her alive?

01:18:50.490 --> 01:18:52.424
Why would you do that?

01:18:52.426 --> 01:18:54.793
- Because she's a bitch.
- Excuse me?

01:18:54.795 --> 01:18:56.961
Because she's a bitch.

01:18:56.963 --> 01:18:58.929
Oh, she's a total bitch.

01:18:58.931 --> 01:19:01.366
- She's a parasite.
- How dare you!

01:19:01.368 --> 01:19:02.768
We're going to die anyway,
Apple.

01:19:02.770 --> 01:19:04.468
- You're bullshitting.
- I'm not.

01:19:04.470 --> 01:19:05.504
- You wouldn't.
- Would.

01:19:05.506 --> 01:19:06.537
- No you wouldn't.
- He would.

01:19:06.539 --> 01:19:07.873
- Shut up!
- No, you shut up.

01:19:07.875 --> 01:19:08.773
Leech.

01:19:08.775 --> 01:19:10.909
I don't believe you.

01:19:10.911 --> 01:19:14.045
What have you got to lose?

01:19:14.047 --> 01:19:15.981
Go on, Apple.

01:19:15.983 --> 01:19:18.683
Play with your food a little.

01:19:18.685 --> 01:19:19.753
Alright.

01:19:21.954 --> 01:19:24.589
Try anything,
and you all die.

01:19:24.591 --> 01:19:26.758
Norman, I hope you know
what you're doing.

01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:28.730
Well get on with it
or I'll gut the pack of ya!

01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:41.507
Well I guess now we know

01:19:41.509 --> 01:19:43.040
where you get
your athleticism from.

01:19:56.622 --> 01:19:58.960
Now, listen.

01:20:01.895 --> 01:20:05.429
No need to do anything stupid.

01:20:05.431 --> 01:20:07.366
I can talk about your record.

01:20:07.368 --> 01:20:08.500
Get you a pardon.

01:20:08.502 --> 01:20:10.468
You can see your daughter.

01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:11.937
Apari.

01:20:11.939 --> 01:20:13.437
Brother.

01:20:13.439 --> 01:20:15.574
It's Apari.

01:20:15.576 --> 01:20:18.680
And I'm not
your fuckin' brother.

01:20:23.417 --> 01:20:27.422
Hey, you dirty Abo bastard!

01:20:33.827 --> 01:20:37.963
Fuckin' foreigners!

01:20:52.145 --> 01:20:53.911
Is anyone else hungry?

01:20:53.913 --> 01:20:54.946
Yeah.

01:20:54.948 --> 01:20:57.048
Starving.

01:20:57.050 --> 01:20:59.851
I could murder a witchetty grub.

01:20:59.853 --> 01:21:01.556
I think we need a new diet.

01:21:05.192 --> 01:21:07.726
Suppose I'll clean it up myself,
then.

01:21:07.728 --> 01:21:09.628
Fuckin' foreigners.

01:22:19.131 --> 01:22:21.700
Hello sir,
what can we do for you?

01:22:21.702 --> 01:22:23.735
What's all this foreign shit?

01:22:23.737 --> 01:22:25.003
Haven't you got any meat?

01:22:25.005 --> 01:22:27.505
Oh, we're vegan, actually.

01:22:27.507 --> 01:22:29.174
Fuckin' poms.

01:22:29.176 --> 01:22:32.043
This is Australia.

01:22:32.045 --> 01:22:35.513
I'm sure we can make
an exception for you, sir.

01:23:33.008 --> 01:23:38.008
