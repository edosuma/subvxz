WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:02.207
CARTER: Whoa!

00:02.377 --> 00:03.127
CARTER: Previously
on Eureka...

00:03.295 --> 00:05.877
FARGO: Loose Smart Dust
could potentially
disrupt every band

00:06.048 --> 00:06.878
on the electromagnetic
spectrum.

00:07.049 --> 00:10.667
Phones, computers,
the neural impulses
in our brains.

00:11.762 --> 00:12.922
Where's the control unit?

00:13.096 --> 00:14.085
Uh-oh.

00:14.264 --> 00:17.006
SHAW: We have
a G.D. employee in custody
under suspicion of espionage.

00:17.184 --> 00:19.675
Justice will be taking
over that investigation
immediately.

00:20.229 --> 00:22.060
SARAH: You have
one message in your inbox.

00:24.942 --> 00:27.934
Holly was printing
a body blank in the
Neural Networking Lab.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.271
Why?
I don't know.

00:31.615 --> 00:32.570
Carter.

00:33.408 --> 00:34.944
Sorry, Jo.
Can't help you right now.

00:35.118 --> 00:36.619
Got some things
to take care of.

00:37.871 --> 00:38.860
Those are Z-waves.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.280
Yeah, but then
Holly's pattern wasn't
the only one stuck in there.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.574
Or maybe something else
is trying to get out.

00:43.752 --> 00:45.288
Something else
from the matrix?
That ain't good.

00:45.462 --> 00:46.702
SHAW: Zane Donovan?

00:46.880 --> 00:49.542
You're under arrest
for obstruction of justice
and destroying evidence.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.382
CARTER: Fargo,
I think I found the
Smart Dust Controller.

00:58.809 --> 00:59.798
(GASPS)

01:03.438 --> 01:04.769
HOLLY: Hi.

01:08.110 --> 01:09.270
(GRUNTS)

01:12.030 --> 01:13.361
Now we're even.

01:19.788 --> 01:21.119
Where have you been?

01:21.290 --> 01:23.497
I've been trying
to reach you for hours.

01:23.667 --> 01:25.203
Sorry, I guess
the Smart Dust is still,

01:25.377 --> 01:27.208
yeah, messing with
the cell reception.

01:27.379 --> 01:29.586
But we found
the control unit,
which is good.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.087
Fargo says
he'll have it fixed soon.

01:31.258 --> 01:32.794
No, not that.
Zane and I
found something.

01:32.968 --> 01:35.801
We don't even know
what we found and
then Shaw arrested him.

01:36.388 --> 01:38.720
Yeah, we heard.

01:41.768 --> 01:43.304
And then you decided
to have coffee?

01:43.478 --> 01:45.139
Oh, don't you fret,
Doctor Blake.

01:45.314 --> 01:48.647
Miss Lupo is handling
the situation as we speak.

01:48.817 --> 01:49.897
Handling it how?

01:50.068 --> 01:53.686
Her usual way,
with intimidation
and brute force.

01:53.864 --> 01:55.024
Jack, this isn't funny.

01:55.198 --> 01:58.281
Shaw thinks
that Zane destroyed
classified files.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.237
And something else
disturbing is going on.

02:00.412 --> 02:04.371
Jo, Henry, Holly...
People are not
acting like themselves.

02:05.042 --> 02:06.373
I'm sure it's just
the Smart Dust.

02:06.543 --> 02:08.750
The electro-magnetic chaff
could be affecting
people's brain functions.

02:08.920 --> 02:09.875
No, I don't think
that that's it...

02:10.047 --> 02:13.005
But, E.M. levels
are on the decline.

02:14.176 --> 02:16.337
See? We have a plan.

02:16.970 --> 02:20.133
Doctor Tuchman, one
Peruvian macchiato
to go. Enjoy.

02:20.307 --> 02:21.922
Thanks, Vincent.

02:31.568 --> 02:34.685
Well, I think
we should probably
get back to work.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.023
Catch up with you
later, babe.

02:36.198 --> 02:37.813
Promise.
Bye.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.697
Where are you going?

02:39.868 --> 02:41.278
Protect and serve.

02:51.421 --> 02:52.536
You have a visitor.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.502
Could we, um,
have a moment?

02:58.720 --> 03:01.302
Make it fast.
You don't have much time.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.518
Grace, good to see you.

03:09.106 --> 03:11.188
So Henry, have you
thought about what I said?

03:11.358 --> 03:14.065
Of course.
Could you remind me?

03:14.236 --> 03:15.191
Don't play.

03:15.362 --> 03:18.149
You are not responsible
for me being locked up.

03:18.323 --> 03:19.938
Which is why I'm not
giving you a choice.

03:20.117 --> 03:23.075
If you that say that
you helped me leak
classified information,

03:23.245 --> 03:26.237
l'll deny it. They have
no evidence to hold you.

03:26.415 --> 03:28.280
They have no evidence
to hold you.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.323
Shaw's just
making an example.

03:30.502 --> 03:31.787
Henry, I know
what I did

03:31.962 --> 03:33.452
and I can accept
the consequences.

03:33.630 --> 03:36.542
I can't, I won't,

03:37.968 --> 03:39.253
and that's why
I'm getting you
out of here.

03:40.011 --> 03:41.876
Henry, what are you...

03:43.348 --> 03:44.963
Grace, trust me.

03:45.726 --> 03:47.341
This is the only way.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.055
You're my wife.

03:58.280 --> 04:01.192
And I will never
let you go.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.317
(SIREN WAILING)

04:18.967 --> 04:22.380
Morning.
Doctor Tuchman, right?

04:23.138 --> 04:26.551
Uh, yes. I do
something wrong, Sheriff?

04:26.725 --> 04:30.058
Well, the Smart
Asphalt sensors said
you were weaving.

04:30.228 --> 04:31.513
Well, I don't think so.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.679
It's probably
just a glitch.

04:33.899 --> 04:37.107
Say, weren't you on
the Astraeus crew?

04:38.403 --> 04:40.564
Yeah, unfortunately,
as it turned out.

04:40.739 --> 04:43.776
Yeah. You're going to
have to come with us.

04:44.493 --> 04:47.530
To where?
Back where you belong.

04:48.246 --> 04:49.622
ldont
I don't understand.

04:50.665 --> 04:51.950
You will.

04:52.918 --> 04:54.829
Get out
of the car, please.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.087
This way.

05:01.009 --> 05:02.089
This way.

05:03.261 --> 05:04.467
Right here.

05:06.348 --> 05:07.929
Right this way.

05:25.575 --> 05:26.690
I've got you.

05:26.868 --> 05:29.405
You're just making this
harder on yourself, Donovan.

05:29.579 --> 05:32.867
I know you destroyed
the files implicating
Doctor Monroe.

05:33.124 --> 05:35.581
What files
do you speak of?

05:36.503 --> 05:37.959
You're trying
my patience, kid.

05:38.129 --> 05:39.665
And you're wasting
my time, pops.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.000
You've got nothing
tying me to this

05:41.174 --> 05:43.085
or you would have
arrested me by now.

05:44.010 --> 05:47.423
He's right.
He's guilty,
and we both know it.

05:47.597 --> 05:49.713
Probably.
But you don't have
enough to charge him.

05:49.891 --> 05:50.846
(LAUGHS)

05:51.017 --> 05:54.305
You want me to release
your boyfriend. Shocking.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.640
He won't go anywhere
we can't find him.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.600
MAN: Major Shaw, sir?

06:02.320 --> 06:04.902
Probably? Whose side
are you on, Jo?

06:05.073 --> 06:07.530
Do you want to be
in his custody or mine?

06:10.453 --> 06:12.739
Grace Monroe just
escaped from detention.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.654
What? How?

06:14.833 --> 06:17.575
I don't know,
But it looks like
someone else helped her.

06:17.752 --> 06:19.253
While I was in here.

06:20.130 --> 06:21.461
Apology accepted.

06:22.883 --> 06:25.590
You can cut him loose.
But he's your responsibility.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.297
Gather your team.
I want Monroe found.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.885
Promise me
you won't wander off.

06:43.862 --> 06:44.817
(SIGHS)

06:44.988 --> 06:46.398
There is something
very, very wrong.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.359
People are doing things
that don't make any sense,

06:48.533 --> 06:49.739
like they've
been brainwashed.

06:49.910 --> 06:53.698
Well, with Smart Dust
jamming up the works,
they could be.

06:53.872 --> 06:56.705
Jack said you found
the control unit
and you were fixing it.

06:56.875 --> 06:57.955
That's the first
We heard of it.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.741
I haven't seen
Carter in hours.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.627
See? Brainwashed.
Him or me?

07:03.381 --> 07:05.042
Jury's still out.

07:07.010 --> 07:08.875
Um, where's the
bio-printer?

07:09.554 --> 07:11.385
Henry said that
he had it moved
to maintenance.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.012
I never authorized that.

07:13.558 --> 07:15.799
(SIGHS) I'm guessing
that you didn't give
Holly permission

07:15.977 --> 07:17.638
to start printing
body blanks either.

07:17.812 --> 07:21.304
What? Do you know
how many millions of
dollars those things cost?

07:21.483 --> 07:23.519
Man, girlfriends
are expensive.

07:23.693 --> 07:24.648
What was she thinking?

07:24.819 --> 07:26.559
I don't think she was.

07:26.738 --> 07:29.354
Zane found other
Z-wave signatures
in the mainframe

07:29.532 --> 07:31.113
where Holly
was being stored.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.821
What if that's why
she started bio-printing
more bodies?

07:34.204 --> 07:36.616
But, why would she create
new bodies for them?

07:37.165 --> 07:38.996
Maybe because
the program
told her to.

07:39.167 --> 07:41.249
There was a deliberate
energy pulse in the lab.

07:41.419 --> 07:44.832
What if it was a command
that her neural processor
was responding to?

07:45.465 --> 07:48.582
So, you really think
others are controlling Holly?

07:48.760 --> 07:50.625
Zane and I saw something.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.796
Hands, like someone
was trying to get out.

07:54.891 --> 07:56.222
What if they did?

08:00.855 --> 08:02.846
Power supply
is holding steady.

08:03.024 --> 08:06.107
Smart Dust
control unit is
working perfectly.

08:06.277 --> 08:09.019
Virtual Eureka
is back online.

08:09.197 --> 08:10.357
This time
they won't get out.

08:10.532 --> 08:12.773
I'm going
to miss this one.

08:17.247 --> 08:19.329
We can always
make you a new one.
Hmm.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.660
And when we get
the rest of them,

08:21.835 --> 08:23.371
I think I'm going
to like it out here.

08:33.847 --> 08:38.216
Well, it looks like
these DNA profiles were
bio-printed onto the bodies.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.719
Oh, my God.
It's Jo and Henry

08:41.896 --> 08:43.477
and at least
a dozen others.

08:44.065 --> 08:45.100
If they took
the bio-printer,

08:45.275 --> 08:46.640
they could have
copied anyone by now.

08:46.818 --> 08:49.230
Fargo, people aren't
being brainwashed.

08:49.404 --> 08:51.269
They're being replaced.

08:52.157 --> 08:54.239
What are you guys
looking at?
(GASPS)

08:54.409 --> 08:55.524
What?

08:55.702 --> 08:57.909
l was released, okay?

08:58.079 --> 09:00.456
I didn't bust out,
like some else I know.

09:04.127 --> 09:07.460
lt's Jack,
he's one of them.

09:12.302 --> 09:13.508
Who's "them"?

09:21.311 --> 09:24.474
Doctor Yoo!
Just the woman
I'm looking for.

09:24.647 --> 09:25.636
What can I do
for you, Sheriff?

09:25.815 --> 09:27.646
Well, I need you
to come with me.
Police business.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.148
I need your expertise.

09:29.319 --> 09:31.310
Oh, okay.
Yeah.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.689
Love the jacket,
by the way.

09:40.163 --> 09:41.403
You're telling me
Carter, Henry and Jo

09:41.581 --> 09:43.321
are evil clones
made by Holly?

09:43.500 --> 09:46.082
Well, technically, V.R.
programmed intelligences
in bio-printed bodies,

09:46.252 --> 09:47.162
but yeah, evil clones.

09:47.337 --> 09:48.918
Yeah, I knew
Jo was off,
but not that off.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.420
I can't believe
this is happening.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.081
Tell me about it.
My resurrected girlfriend
is the Manchurian Candidate.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.250
Well, we have to find them.
We need outside help.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.544
Well, halfthe time
we can't call out,
reception is so spotty.

09:58.181 --> 09:59.170
l have an idea.

10:00.391 --> 10:02.222
l have access
to a priority-five
GETS hard-line

10:02.393 --> 10:03.974
that goes directly
to NORAD H.Q.

10:09.984 --> 10:10.848
lt's dead.

10:11.027 --> 10:12.312
They've cut us off.
We're on our own now.

10:12.487 --> 10:13.397
All right.
What about Shaw?

10:15.031 --> 10:16.237
They don't have
his DNA on file,

10:16.407 --> 10:17.738
so they can't copy him.

10:17.909 --> 10:19.900
Plus he has
rocket launchers.
I'm on it.

10:20.078 --> 10:22.410
l have to find my kids.
All right. I'm going
to get us some weapons.

10:22.580 --> 10:25.663
Non-lethal. If we can't tell
the good guys from the bad,
we can't just kill them.

10:25.834 --> 10:27.950
Well, we better hope
the evil clones play
by the same rules then.

10:28.670 --> 10:31.377
Director, I know people
have infiltrated G.D.

10:31.548 --> 10:34.631
That's why I'm here.
I'm not talking spies,
more doubles.

10:34.801 --> 10:35.916
Double agents?
No.

10:36.094 --> 10:39.757
Haven't you noticed
people have been acting
not themselves lately?

10:42.058 --> 10:43.343
One person
comes to mind.

10:43.518 --> 10:45.349
No, not me.
I mean Jo.

10:45.520 --> 10:46.760
Am I interrupting?

10:46.938 --> 10:50.101
No, we're just,
military man talk.

10:50.275 --> 10:53.438
Really. You served?
Which division?

10:53.611 --> 10:54.600
Um...

10:55.280 --> 10:56.816
Long division.

10:58.116 --> 11:00.072
The Director seems
very distressed about...

11:00.243 --> 11:01.483
Grace's escape, that...

11:01.661 --> 11:03.447
lt's terrible, really.
Do you have any new leads?

11:03.621 --> 11:04.781
Actually, uh, yes.

11:04.956 --> 11:07.288
Comm's still patchy
but we have
a security scan hit.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.790
Grace Monroe's
credit card was
used an hour ago

11:09.961 --> 11:11.542
at a service station
in Grants Pass.

11:11.713 --> 11:12.623
All right.
Let's get a team moving.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.958
Wait, wait, wait.
That's weird, isn't it?

11:15.133 --> 11:16.543
I mean, Grace
wouldn't be so careless.

11:16.718 --> 11:18.629
She's on the run.
People panic.

11:18.803 --> 11:22.512
Sir, every second we waste,
her trail gets colder.

11:22.682 --> 11:25.469
Agreed. Keep us
on high alert
until I return.

11:26.978 --> 11:28.969
Fargo, l was wondering
if we could review

11:29.147 --> 11:31.058
the latest security
lockdown procedures.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.813
They're in my office.

11:34.319 --> 11:35.434
No, it's okay.

11:35.612 --> 11:39.070
I mean the regularly
scheduled security
briefing will be fine.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.412
You expect me
to believe that

11:48.583 --> 11:49.993
people are being
body-snatched?

11:50.168 --> 11:51.157
I know how it sounds...

11:51.336 --> 11:53.918
It sounds like
you're stupid,
or stoned, or both.

11:54.088 --> 11:55.874
My vote is for both.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.129
Just think for a minute.

11:57.300 --> 12:00.588
Has anyone you know
been acting strangely?
Not themselves?

12:02.931 --> 12:04.842
Tuchman didn't show up
for work today,

12:05.016 --> 12:06.722
but he's always had
a lazy work ethic.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.554
Lazy work ethic, huh?

12:22.158 --> 12:24.865
Okay, how is this
even possible?

12:25.036 --> 12:28.528
Oh, my God,
Zane, stay back.
That is not me.

12:28.706 --> 12:29.957
What?

12:30.833 --> 12:32.994
You're not me. I'm me.

12:36.798 --> 12:40.006
What the hell, Zane?
Come on, man, I'm me!

12:40.176 --> 12:41.382
Prove it.

12:41.552 --> 12:43.383
Okay, uh, during
Astraeus training,

12:43.554 --> 12:44.805
uh, you came
into Cafe Diem

12:44.973 --> 12:46.383
and I tried to give you
one of my limacoids

12:46.557 --> 12:47.421
and you didn't
want to take it

12:47.600 --> 12:48.715
so we thought that
it would be funny

12:51.187 --> 12:52.927
Zane, come on,
just shoot this idiot.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.391
You know he's not me.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.265
I trust you.

13:00.571 --> 13:01.731
If you say so.
(GUN CLICKING)

13:01.906 --> 13:02.861
Zane, don't!

13:07.412 --> 13:08.401
(GRUNTS)

13:17.630 --> 13:22.340
How did you know
that it wasn't me?

13:23.344 --> 13:25.255
The real you
wouldn't trust me.

13:27.765 --> 13:30.302
You dematerialized me.

13:31.894 --> 13:33.930
Yeah, what happened
to non-lethal weapons?

13:34.605 --> 13:36.516
Oh, that one's
a work-in-progress.

13:36.941 --> 13:38.317
You don't say.

13:41.154 --> 13:44.646
Betrayed by my
own DNA. Gross.

13:44.824 --> 13:48.567
So, what else can
we use that won't
splatter innocent people?

13:49.120 --> 13:52.032
Well, I guess we could
develop something

13:52.206 --> 13:54.492
that would specifically
target them.

13:54.667 --> 13:58.706
But if they're like Holly,
they're basically human.

13:59.797 --> 14:01.628
Yeah, their bodies,

14:01.799 --> 14:05.007
but not the Z-waves
underpinning
their consciousness.

14:05.178 --> 14:08.045
What if we make
a sort of E.M.P.

14:08.222 --> 14:11.055
that'll fry only that
brainwave frequency?

14:11.225 --> 14:15.218
That would knock them
all out, if it worked.

14:17.190 --> 14:19.647
Trust me. It's not
my first rodeo.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.362
| taste like chicken.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.549
Doug?
(GASPS)

14:46.719 --> 14:48.835
Holly?
I'm so glad to see you.

14:49.013 --> 14:51.504
Okay, why, exactly?

14:51.682 --> 14:54.970
Something really weird
is happening. It's like...

14:56.479 --> 14:58.720
It's like I'm not
myself anymore.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.435
I mean, not at
this exact moment.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.110
Right now, I am me.

15:04.195 --> 15:05.856
| just don't know
for how long.

15:08.491 --> 15:09.981
They're making me
do things.

15:11.744 --> 15:12.824
Who?

15:14.205 --> 15:17.572
The N.P.C.'s from
Matrix Eureka.

15:18.584 --> 15:20.495
It's like they made me
walk in my sleep,

15:20.670 --> 15:22.786
but instead of
raiding the fridge,

15:23.548 --> 15:26.836
l'm spitting out bodies
like the Queen Alien
on LV-426.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.876
Okay, well,
that would explain
why Allison and l

15:30.054 --> 15:32.340
found DNA patterns
in your bio-printer files.

15:32.515 --> 15:34.506
They made me do it, Doug.

15:34.684 --> 15:36.549
lt's, it's, it's okay.

15:36.727 --> 15:39.810
I knew you wouldn't go
pod-person on purpose.

15:41.524 --> 15:44.357
But why would they
print replicants of us?

15:44.527 --> 15:45.767
What do they want?

15:45.945 --> 15:47.685
They're everywhere.

15:48.531 --> 15:51.238
Come on. I know a place
where we can talk safely.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.410
SARAH, where's Kevin?

15:56.581 --> 15:57.821
I need you to pack
an overnight bag.

15:57.999 --> 16:00.160
We're going on vacation.
Sweet. Where to?

16:00.334 --> 16:01.619
To your nana's.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.079
Okay, that's not a vacation.

16:03.254 --> 16:05.119
All right, that's me
staying upwind
of Grandpa all day.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.038
I mean he needs to lay
off the chili, I'm sorry...

16:07.216 --> 16:10.424
Honey, just pack!
Quickly, please, now.

16:10.595 --> 16:12.802
SARAH: Doctor Blake,
your blood pressure
is elevated.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.963
Is everything all right?
SARAH, I'm fine.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.347
Honey, I'll explain
it to you on the way.

16:16.517 --> 16:18.508
We need to pick up
Jenna from daycare.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.142
CARTER: Oh, no need.

16:21.105 --> 16:22.766
I've got her right here.

16:27.695 --> 16:28.901
Hi, Mommy.

16:30.698 --> 16:32.234
Hey, babe.

16:32.408 --> 16:33.989
Where you
running off to?

16:43.294 --> 16:46.081
Kevin, bring
Jenna upstairs...

16:47.840 --> 16:48.499
Now.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.289
Hey, Mom, why
are you tripping?

16:50.468 --> 16:51.924
Yeah.

16:53.221 --> 16:54.757
Jack isn't himself.

16:55.348 --> 16:56.804
He's sick.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.430
I need to bring him to G.D.

16:59.769 --> 17:01.600
Actually, I've
never felt better.

17:01.771 --> 17:03.978
SARAH: Doctor Blake,
a full-body CT. scan

17:04.148 --> 17:06.184
shows that Sheriff Carter
is perfectly healthy.

17:06.526 --> 17:09.893
Hmm! And looking
fon/vard to some
quality time together.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.020
Not with them.

17:12.782 --> 17:14.989
We can go somewhere alone.

17:16.452 --> 17:18.693
Subtle, Mom.
Dang, get a room.

17:18.871 --> 17:21.283
Oh, it's not what
she means, but...

17:22.208 --> 17:23.038
I've got a room.

17:23.209 --> 17:26.872
Here. SARAH, why don't you
make a snack for the kids?

17:27.046 --> 17:29.628
SARAH: Happy to.
But there's just one thing.

17:34.136 --> 17:35.046
(GRUNTS)

17:35.221 --> 17:36.381
SARAH, what...
What are you doing?

17:36.556 --> 17:38.672
Kevin, it's fine.
This isn't Jack.

17:39.517 --> 17:40.347
What?

17:40.518 --> 17:42.679
It's a long story.
SARAH, how did you know?

17:42.853 --> 17:45.890
My CT. scan also included
a DNA analysis.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.726
Although it matched
Sheriff Carter perfectly,

17:47.900 --> 17:50.186
his cells are
only one day old.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.435
You mean he's a clone?

17:53.614 --> 17:54.945
Sweet! Can we
keep him, please?

17:55.116 --> 17:57.277
This is Jack's evil twin,
not a puppy.

17:57.451 --> 17:58.907
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

17:59.453 --> 18:01.944
Zane, can you hear me?

18:02.123 --> 18:03.488
Tell me that
you found something.

18:03.666 --> 18:05.577
How about a Z-wave bomb
that” fit in your pocket

18:05.751 --> 18:07.958
but should knock out
all the N.P.C.'s in one go?

18:08.129 --> 18:10.461
Wait a minute,
"should" knock them out?

18:11.882 --> 18:13.918
Yeah, we just need
an N.P.C. test subject

18:14.093 --> 18:16.209
that we can calibrate
the Z-wave frequency.

18:16.387 --> 18:19.550
We, uh, kind of
microwaved our last one.

18:20.391 --> 18:22.302
Okay, well, I think
I can help you with that,

18:22.476 --> 18:23.602
but we need
to find safe place

18:23.769 --> 18:25.305
where they won't be
looking for us.

18:25.479 --> 18:27.606
Um, I'll meet you
at the cabin.

18:28.316 --> 18:30.147
Kevin, honey,
I need you to
help me move him.

18:30.318 --> 18:32.559
And then I need you
to lock the door and
keep Jenna inside.

18:32.737 --> 18:34.318
Don't let anyone in
until I get back.

18:34.488 --> 18:36.069
SARAH: Don't worry.
I'll keep them safe.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.650
Mom, you're scaring me.

18:38.701 --> 18:41.317
Honey, everything
is going to be okay,
all right?

18:41.495 --> 18:43.406
I just need you
to trust me.

18:43.581 --> 18:45.071
Okay, come on.
Let's move him.

18:52.381 --> 18:54.372
It was so terrifying.

18:54.550 --> 18:57.667
It was like that dream
where you're trying to scream

18:57.845 --> 18:59.130
but all you can
speak is Orcish

18:59.305 --> 19:02.217
and you know
what you're doing
is wrong, but...

19:02.892 --> 19:04.553
You have no way
to stop yourself.

19:04.727 --> 19:07.093
Yeah, I don't,
I don't think I've
ever had that dream.

19:07.271 --> 19:08.886
Me neither, but...

19:09.065 --> 19:11.272
That's exactly
what it was like.

19:11.442 --> 19:13.854
So, um,
where are we going?

19:14.320 --> 19:16.561
Oh, just
a little bit further.

19:18.783 --> 19:21.650
Brain-jacking
really, really sucks.

19:24.872 --> 19:26.408
You're my hero.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.753
Are you looking for this?

19:37.343 --> 19:39.254
I really
wanted to trust you.

19:39.428 --> 19:40.634
You can't win, Doug.

19:42.890 --> 19:43.879
(GROANS)

19:45.726 --> 19:47.512
I'm so sorry, Holly.

19:55.945 --> 19:58.027
Well, that was uncalled for.

19:58.572 --> 20:01.314
Where's Jack?
Let's call it "napping."

20:02.618 --> 20:03.778
So he's alive?

20:05.246 --> 20:08.704
Of course.
He's a valuable
intellectual resource.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.455
You all are.
We don't want to hurt you.

20:10.626 --> 20:12.833
I wasn't born
yesterday unlike you.

20:13.003 --> 20:14.254
Clever.

20:14.588 --> 20:16.203
It's for the
greater good, Allie.

20:16.382 --> 20:18.293
Just think about it,
when you're back inside,

20:18.467 --> 20:21.550
you'll be able to create
all sorts of amazing things

20:21.721 --> 20:23.882
without potentially
destroying the world.

20:25.015 --> 20:26.630
Back in where...

20:28.394 --> 20:29.554
Beverly's Matrix program.

20:29.729 --> 20:32.471
You're still acting
on your last directive
to keep us inside.

20:34.024 --> 20:35.150
Call me stubborn.

20:35.317 --> 20:38.775
So, you want to put
the entire Astraeus crew
back in Matrix Eureka?

20:38.946 --> 20:40.937
We're protecting you
from yourselves

20:41.115 --> 20:42.901
so that you can work
in safety and peace

20:43.075 --> 20:44.406
and the more
brainpower, the better.

20:44.577 --> 20:47.910
My work is here.
My family is here.
Jack is here.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.284
Yes, I am.

20:51.500 --> 20:55.163
And when I'm done,
no one will even miss you.

21:03.846 --> 21:06.132
A flux compression
generator bomb?

21:06.766 --> 21:07.721
Nice.

21:07.892 --> 21:11.805
Yeah, when it's time,
we flip that switch.
Sayonara, doppelgangers.

21:11.979 --> 21:15.437
You know, Donovan,
I've always maintained that
under proper supervision

21:15.608 --> 21:17.314
you are not
completely incompetent.

21:17.485 --> 21:18.770
Well, damn, Parrish.

21:18.944 --> 21:21.686
That's probably
the nicest thing
you've ever said to...

21:22.782 --> 21:24.613
Probably anyone, actually.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.949
All right,
let's meet Allison

21:28.120 --> 21:29.826
and take down
these meat puppets.
Okay.

21:29.997 --> 21:32.488
N.P.C. LARRY: May l
have your attention?

21:32.666 --> 21:36.158
By order of Director Fargo,
G.D. is now under lockdown.

21:36.337 --> 21:39.295
No entering or exiting
without authorization.

21:40.090 --> 21:41.751
Have a nice day.
Yeah.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.508
Are we there yet?
Shut up.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.845
Oh, would you
look at that.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.889
Damn it.
There's nowhere
to run, Allie.

21:55.064 --> 21:56.929
OFFICER: Unit one, close in.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.459
(GASPING)

22:33.352 --> 22:36.139
You're only making it
worse for yourself.

22:39.525 --> 22:42.062
Well, she's got spunk.
I'll give her that.

22:45.281 --> 22:48.114
PA SYSTEM: G.D. is
now on lockdown status Bravo.

22:48.701 --> 22:49.941
Oh, crap.

22:51.829 --> 22:53.785
Why would Fargo
lock us down?

22:53.956 --> 22:55.742
I'm betting he didn't.

22:56.333 --> 22:58.244
You think
Larry's been replaced?

22:58.419 --> 22:59.955
Maybe all of them have.

23:00.129 --> 23:01.915
Either way, we're trapped.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.796
The N.P.C.s think that
I've been replaced, right?

23:09.805 --> 23:10.965
So, as N.P.C. Parrish,

23:11.140 --> 23:12.755
I put you in handcuffs
and I walk you

23:12.933 --> 23:15.515
right out the front door
as my prisoner.

23:15.686 --> 23:16.892
I don't know, man.

23:17.062 --> 23:18.563
Come on, Zane.

23:19.773 --> 23:22.901
Dude, it'll bejust like
in Star Wars when Han Solo
put Chewie in handcuffs

23:23.068 --> 23:24.979
to fool the Imperial Guards.

23:25.571 --> 23:27.687
In this scenario,
you're Han Solo?

23:27.865 --> 23:28.775
Yeah.

23:30.075 --> 23:33.738
Trust me, Zane.
l was born to do this.

23:35.039 --> 23:36.870
I can't believe
it didn't work.

23:37.249 --> 23:39.365
Seriously, dude,
you're an asshat.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.825
Come on, Han, time to
encase you in carbonite.

23:42.004 --> 23:42.959
Oh, he's kidding.

23:43.130 --> 23:44.165
Actually we're
going to insert

23:44.340 --> 23:46.581
a bio-absorbable stent
made of polylactic acid

23:46.759 --> 23:48.090
into your bloodstream
and then hook you up

23:48.260 --> 23:50.922
to a giant
hive-mind forever.

23:52.431 --> 23:53.420
Huh.

23:55.017 --> 23:57.099
That is so not better.

24:04.401 --> 24:05.732
(PANTING)

24:26.131 --> 24:28.042
I am really done with her.

24:29.301 --> 24:30.632
We'll find her.

24:33.847 --> 24:35.758
CARTER: Hear that,
Allison?

24:38.644 --> 24:40.851
Come out, come out
wherever you are!

25:20.185 --> 25:22.517
And where do you
think you're going?

25:22.855 --> 25:24.391
To find my husband.

25:24.565 --> 25:25.850
Baby, I'm hurt.

25:26.859 --> 25:28.815
He's right here.
N.P.C. GUARD:
You got her, boss?

25:28.986 --> 25:30.021
The hell he is.

25:30.195 --> 25:31.184
(GROANS)

25:36.035 --> 25:36.649
Stop.

25:36.827 --> 25:39.569
N.P.C. JO: Carter, Andy,
she's on the road.

25:42.541 --> 25:43.826
Stop.

25:44.001 --> 25:45.411
Allison, what are you...

25:46.128 --> 25:47.459
Go! Go! Go!

25:47.796 --> 25:48.785
Go!

25:55.387 --> 25:56.627
Now what?

25:57.181 --> 25:58.967
Now we do this
the hard way.

26:01.226 --> 26:02.386
What happened to her?

26:02.561 --> 26:04.426
You were right.
The N.P.C.s have
been controlling her,

26:04.605 --> 26:06.470
making her
bio-print bodies
to download into.

26:06.648 --> 26:07.854
That's because
they're putting
people back inside

26:10.486 --> 26:12.317
They're trying
to replace us all.

26:13.155 --> 26:14.486
Not without a fight.

26:17.493 --> 26:19.984
I'm telling you, Vincent,
people are being taken.

26:20.162 --> 26:21.197
By whom?

26:22.081 --> 26:24.117
By the Sheriff
and Deputy Andy,

26:24.291 --> 26:25.406
and Jo and her guards.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.454
We need to warn everyone.

26:30.047 --> 26:31.412
Oh, my God,
they're here.

26:35.677 --> 26:38.589
Okay, everyone
in the freezer.

26:44.436 --> 26:45.551
Come on.

26:58.367 --> 26:59.607
Hey, Jo! Hey, Andy!

26:59.785 --> 27:01.867
Hey, Vincent,
where is everybody?

27:03.539 --> 27:04.619
In the freezer.

27:20.305 --> 27:22.296
Oh. Carter
put in satellite TV.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.760
How very old school.
Fargo, focus.
Something is wrong.

27:24.935 --> 27:26.345
Zane and Parrish
should've been here by now.

27:26.520 --> 27:28.226
Unless they were taken.

27:30.482 --> 27:33.394
We need their bomb
to nullify the N.P.C.s'
Z-wave signature.

27:33.569 --> 27:34.524
We're going to have
to do this ourselves.

27:34.695 --> 27:36.231
But we have
to connect it to

27:36.405 --> 27:38.441
the Smart Dust control unit
to amplify the pulse.

27:39.408 --> 27:41.990
I bet the clone army's
using it to power
the new Matrix computer.

27:42.161 --> 27:43.446
Yeah, except
we don't have the Z-bomb.

27:43.954 --> 27:45.569
That does pose an issue.

27:47.332 --> 27:49.914
Wait a minute. Zane said
the Z-bomb fit in his pocket.

27:50.085 --> 27:51.291
So, if he and
Parrish were taken,

27:51.461 --> 27:52.746
maybe he could
still have it.

27:52.921 --> 27:53.831
So, we just
need to find out

27:54.006 --> 27:55.337
where they're being held
and activate it.

27:55.507 --> 27:57.008
Except we have
no clue where that is.

27:57.926 --> 27:59.541
But someone does.

28:00.637 --> 28:02.218
We just need
to follow her.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.094
(GRUNTS)

28:08.353 --> 28:10.059
Nice work, Mata Hari.

28:10.230 --> 28:12.391
And Allison is
where, exactly?

28:13.859 --> 28:15.019
Well played.

28:15.194 --> 28:16.309
We need to
widen and regroup.

28:16.486 --> 28:19.228
The program isn't complete
without the final two.

28:21.658 --> 28:23.398
Mata Hari was probably
innocent, you know.

28:23.577 --> 28:25.408
A better spy analogy
would've been

28:25.579 --> 28:27.786
Emily Geiger from
the American Revolution

28:27.956 --> 28:29.867
or Belle Boyd
during the Civil War.

28:30.042 --> 28:32.954
Oh, or Violette Szabo
from World War II.

28:33.128 --> 28:35.665
She was awesome.
Do you have an off switch?

28:54.233 --> 28:56.599
Okay, you find Zane and
see if he has the Z-bomb.

28:56.777 --> 28:59.564
l'll sync my PDA
to the Smart Dust control unit
to amplify the pulse.

28:59.738 --> 29:00.978
Okay, well, be careful.
Don't get caught.

29:01.156 --> 29:02.396
We may be
the only ones left.

29:02.574 --> 29:04.610
Oh, that's reassuring.
Oh, come on.

29:23.011 --> 29:24.512
FARGO: I'll go this way.

29:40.529 --> 29:41.689
The crew.

30:04.636 --> 30:05.876
Oh, my God.

30:11.435 --> 30:12.845
Oh, Jack.

30:14.021 --> 30:16.137
Honey, wake up.
You got to wake up.

30:31.997 --> 30:33.077
Come on.

30:35.083 --> 30:36.072
(BEEPING)

30:36.460 --> 30:38.291
Silent mode! Silent mode!

30:38.462 --> 30:39.417
Frak!

30:39.588 --> 30:41.704
N.P.C. GUARD 1: Halt!
N.P.C. GUARD 2:
What do you got?

30:42.424 --> 30:43.664
We got an intruder!

30:44.509 --> 30:45.214
Get him!

30:45.802 --> 30:47.008
You, you're with me.

30:47.179 --> 30:49.295
They're outside.
All hands on deck!

30:55.729 --> 30:57.845
Oh, honey, I'll be back.

31:03.528 --> 31:05.109
(PANTING)

31:05.530 --> 31:06.645
N.P.C. GUARD:
They're going to transport.

31:07.657 --> 31:08.783
Down this way.

31:13.372 --> 31:14.657
Hi, Doug.

31:16.958 --> 31:17.617
Okay.

31:18.126 --> 31:20.333
You slippery little fish.

31:20.504 --> 31:21.744
N.P.C. JO: Let's go, Fargo.

31:23.340 --> 31:24.580
Get back! (SCREAMS)

31:24.758 --> 31:26.840
Easy,easy,easy,
we don't want to hurt you.

31:27.010 --> 31:28.875
Speak for yourself.
He made me run.

31:29.346 --> 31:32.463
You know
what they say, Doug.
Resistance is futile.

31:34.601 --> 31:36.102
(BEEPING)

31:36.269 --> 31:37.600
That's what you think.

31:40.315 --> 31:41.065
(LAUGHS) He's controlling
the Smart Dust.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.565
Well, that's annoying.
I can't see anything.

31:45.487 --> 31:47.227
FARGO: I knew
night vision mode
would come in handy.

31:47.406 --> 31:48.316
N.P.C. HENRY:
He won't get far.

31:48.490 --> 31:49.855
N.P.C. JO:
Did anyone see him?
Maybe he's gone this way.

31:50.033 --> 31:51.694
HOLLY: Why is
Doug even bothering?

31:54.663 --> 31:55.493
N.P.C. CARTER: Good question.

32:10.804 --> 32:12.044
Zane, thank God.

32:14.516 --> 32:17.132
Please be the bomb.
Oh, thank you.

32:18.687 --> 32:19.847
N.P.C. JENNA: Mommy?
(GASPS)

32:21.857 --> 32:23.518
What are you doing?

32:30.031 --> 32:32.113
Please don't
hurt me, Mommy.

32:35.370 --> 32:36.610
Please.

32:37.080 --> 32:38.240
Jenna”.

32:42.461 --> 32:45.578
Jenna. No,
you're not real.

32:45.755 --> 32:46.881
You're not real.

32:47.048 --> 32:49.380
Yes, I am,
and I'm scared.

32:49.551 --> 32:51.633
I don't understand
what's happening.

32:53.513 --> 32:55.174
Will you stay with me?

33:00.353 --> 33:01.934
N.P.C. CARTER:
Mommy's tricky, isn't she?

33:05.400 --> 33:07.186
Good job, sweetheart.

33:07.611 --> 33:08.976
Now you go play, okay?

33:09.154 --> 33:11.566
No. I want to watch.

33:13.074 --> 33:14.860
Always the curious one.
(GASPING)

33:15.035 --> 33:16.275
Yeah.

33:17.412 --> 33:19.118
ALLISON: No. No.
There we go.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.050
N.P.C. ANDY: That's quite
enough, Doctor Fargo.

33:38.225 --> 33:40.762
How did you...
l have infrared vision, too.

33:41.228 --> 33:42.434
Oh, man.

33:43.396 --> 33:47.435
So, I suppose
we can't talk
this out, um...

33:47.609 --> 33:49.770
Man to replicant?

33:50.737 --> 33:53.194
Mmm-mmm.
We're done talking.

33:54.574 --> 33:55.609
(SIGHS)

33:56.660 --> 33:59.823
Relax, Mommy.
It's time to go to sleep.

34:01.289 --> 34:03.371
Please. I can't
leave my kids.

34:03.542 --> 34:04.827
Oh, Jo and I will
take care of them.

34:05.001 --> 34:06.957
Over my dead body.

34:07.128 --> 34:08.538
Oh, we don't want that.

34:08.713 --> 34:11.420
Bye, Mommy.
No, stop.

34:11.925 --> 34:15.213
Relax. I'll be right here.

34:16.179 --> 34:17.965
So will i.
(GROANS)

34:18.139 --> 34:19.470
Daddy!
Jack!

34:21.309 --> 34:22.298
(GRUNTING)

34:26.064 --> 34:28.305
Did he hurt you?
No, I'm fine.

34:28.817 --> 34:31.229
I'm so happy
to see you, the real you.

34:37.492 --> 34:39.107
Go! Go!

34:39.286 --> 34:40.321
(GRUNTS)

34:48.378 --> 34:49.709
N.P.C. GUARD:
Check for 'em
in here.

35:03.351 --> 35:04.727
N.P.C. GUARD: Notify backup.

35:07.230 --> 35:10.393
Daddy, they're gone.

35:12.485 --> 35:14.692
Daddy's very angry.

35:18.867 --> 35:20.607
Please tell me
that thing can help us.
It can...

35:20.785 --> 35:23.492
Do I sense
a "but" or an "if"?
If we can amplify it.

35:23.663 --> 35:25.369
Fargo was trying
to link it to the
Smart Dust controller.

35:25.540 --> 35:26.165
But I think they got him.

35:26.333 --> 35:30.997
We can't go back,
not without broadcasting
our location.

35:31.963 --> 35:34.670
Wait, wait.
Broadcasting.
That could work.

35:34.841 --> 35:36.001
I don't think
that will help us.

35:36.176 --> 35:37.291
No, no, the cabin.

35:37.469 --> 35:39.425
We can use the
satellite dish to amplify
the Z-wave signal.

35:39.596 --> 35:41.928
We just have to get
the N.P.C.s to follow us.

35:45.769 --> 35:46.724
N.P.C. GUARD:
Down this way!

35:46.895 --> 35:48.135
I don't think
that's gonna be
a problem. Run!

35:49.481 --> 35:50.891
N.P.C. GUARD: This way.

35:51.066 --> 35:53.182
N.P.C. JO: Spread out.
Don't let them get away.

35:53.360 --> 35:55.851
N.P.C. GUARD: They can't
have gone too far.
Come on, let's go!

36:05.747 --> 36:07.237
Try the back door. (SCREAMS)

36:08.917 --> 36:10.407
Crazy! Crazy! Crazy arms.

36:17.759 --> 36:18.748
(GRUNTS)

36:23.807 --> 36:24.466
Jack!

36:33.525 --> 36:34.560
Okay, where's the
satellite dish?

36:34.734 --> 36:35.814
It's in the loft.
Okay.

36:38.738 --> 36:39.978
Game over.

36:45.036 --> 36:47.778
(GUN COCKlNG)
I just hate
myself sometimes.

36:58.091 --> 36:59.627
(GRUNTING)

37:04.931 --> 37:06.637
You okay?
Yeah.

37:06.808 --> 37:08.264
I gotta kick my ass.

37:16.609 --> 37:17.940
(GRUNTING)

37:19.320 --> 37:20.901
I know all your moves.

37:22.699 --> 37:24.189
(GRUNTING)

37:25.827 --> 37:26.987
This one's new.

37:27.162 --> 37:28.402
(GROANS)

37:37.797 --> 37:39.037
They're coming.

37:41.801 --> 37:43.086
ALLISON: Jack!

37:43.261 --> 37:44.717
Come on, let's go.

37:52.270 --> 37:54.306
ALLISON: Oh, come on,
Jack. Get up.

37:55.064 --> 37:55.769
Oh, my God!

38:10.497 --> 38:11.782
(CHOKING)

38:16.961 --> 38:18.041
Allie!

38:22.926 --> 38:23.881
Up there!

38:24.052 --> 38:26.384
Lights out.

38:27.347 --> 38:28.462
Okay, I got it.

38:37.315 --> 38:38.475
Holly?

38:39.526 --> 38:40.390
(COUGHING)

38:45.573 --> 38:47.825
You okay?
Yeah, are you all right?

38:47.992 --> 38:49.402
Well, there's only
one of me, so yeah.

38:49.869 --> 38:51.484
Well, one of you
is all I need.

38:55.166 --> 38:56.906
I love you so much.

39:07.470 --> 39:09.256
I'm not sure if
I'm comfortable with this.

39:09.430 --> 39:11.557
The N.P.C.s have
human brainwave patterns

39:11.724 --> 39:14.181
that were downloaded
into bio-printed bodies.

39:14.352 --> 39:15.853
There are ethical
considerations

39:16.020 --> 39:17.396
to how we deal with them.

39:19.148 --> 39:20.888
in case
I don't work out.

39:21.067 --> 39:22.477
No comment.

39:28.908 --> 39:30.284
Well, what else we got?

39:30.451 --> 39:31.952
Shaw still camped out
in Fargo's office?

39:32.120 --> 39:35.328
Uh, yes, but
I don't think that
Fargo has noticed.

39:35.498 --> 39:36.658
He hasn't left
Holly's side

39:36.833 --> 39:38.915
since we set off
the Z-wave bomb.

39:39.085 --> 39:40.416
It's been like two weeks.

39:40.587 --> 39:42.123
And she's still comatose.

39:42.714 --> 39:43.999
Yeah.
(BEEPING)

39:45.508 --> 39:47.499
911. Holly...

39:50.179 --> 39:52.170
Is the neural
lattice collapsing?

39:52.348 --> 39:54.509
No. Synaptic
firing rate is rising,
and still stable.

39:54.684 --> 39:56.174
Is that good?

39:57.103 --> 39:58.934
Come on, Holly.
You can do this.

39:59.856 --> 40:01.892
Looks like she's
trying to wake up.

40:02.525 --> 40:03.685
Holly?

40:10.158 --> 40:11.523
(MONITOR BEEPING)

40:11.826 --> 40:12.906
That's my girl.

40:13.786 --> 40:15.868
Okay, now we
just need to...

40:20.627 --> 40:21.867
Oh, hey.

40:22.754 --> 40:25.120
Hi. Welcome back.

40:27.383 --> 40:28.839
You must be
Director Fargo.

40:29.552 --> 40:30.883
I'm Doctor Holly Marten.

40:31.054 --> 40:32.089
I'm here to see
your F.T.L. drives.

40:32.263 --> 40:33.378
Senator Wen sent me.

40:33.556 --> 40:36.343
You lookjust like
your dossier photo.
Most people don't.

40:36.517 --> 40:38.803
I think it's the glasses,
they're very distinctive.

40:40.229 --> 40:41.355
Why doesn't
she remember him?

40:41.522 --> 40:44.309
Knocking out the Z-waves
must've compromised
her solid-state drive.

40:44.484 --> 40:46.224
Yeah, her brain
stores memories
like a computer.

40:46.402 --> 40:48.393
Once that data is lost...
It's gone forever.

40:48.571 --> 40:50.687
Wait, what happened?

40:51.824 --> 40:53.030
Was I in an accident?

40:56.746 --> 40:58.236
Something like that.

41:03.878 --> 41:08.087
Here you go and
sorry about that
whole freezer thing.

41:09.300 --> 41:10.756
That's okay.
Okay.

41:15.473 --> 41:17.509
So, San Francisco
could be nice.
Mmm.

41:17.684 --> 41:18.594
Or Seattle.

41:18.768 --> 41:19.848
It rains too much there.

41:20.979 --> 41:22.389
Unlike here.

41:23.648 --> 41:26.355
Jack, do you really
want to leave Eureka?

41:26.526 --> 41:28.608
Well, I think
at a certain point
we need to ask ourselves

41:28.778 --> 41:30.188
if the universe is trying
to tell us something.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.696
The D.O.D. is
asking themselves
that same question.

41:34.826 --> 41:37.738
Oh, Major Shaw.
I didn't see you
eavesdropping there.

41:38.454 --> 41:40.069
I'm looking for
Director Fargo.

41:41.457 --> 41:42.833
Is there a problem?

41:43.334 --> 41:44.414
Isn't there always?

41:44.836 --> 41:47.418
What were you saying
about the DOD?

41:48.798 --> 41:50.459
I should talk
to the director.

41:50.633 --> 41:52.498
Major, what is going on?

41:54.178 --> 41:56.715
Look, believe me,
the Department appreciates

41:56.889 --> 41:59.551
the remarkable work
that's been done
here in Eureka.

42:00.268 --> 42:01.178
Been done?

42:02.478 --> 42:06.221
Given the latest incident and
breach in national security,

42:06.399 --> 42:09.232
the Department is
terminating its funding
of Global Dynamics.

42:09.736 --> 42:10.976
What?

42:12.071 --> 42:13.607
For how long?

42:14.365 --> 42:15.866
Permanently.

42:16.576 --> 42:18.237
We're shutting Eureka down.

43:07.835 --> 43:10.326
Subtitling : C.M.C.
