00:56.388 --> 00:57.889
<i>I don't know
what the fuck is going on</i>

00:57.891 --> 00:59.657
<i>in this country, man!</i>

00:59.659 --> 01:01.993
<i>Every day I turn on the TV,</i>

01:01.995 --> 01:05.864
<i>and I see these fucking freaks
marching for their rights!</i>

01:07.801 --> 01:09.567
What about our rights?

01:11.337 --> 01:13.738
This is our time
to show the world

01:13.740 --> 01:15.774
that we are not
just an online movement!

01:17.677 --> 01:18.843
<i>We're growing physically!</i>

01:18.845 --> 01:21.546
This is our time
to assert ourselves

01:21.548 --> 01:23.581
as the true voice of America!

01:23.583 --> 01:25.750
Yeah!

01:25.752 --> 01:27.018
Yes, let's do that!

01:27.020 --> 01:29.687
Now, you may have noticed

01:29.689 --> 01:31.890
that our friend Aryan Grande

01:31.892 --> 01:33.625
has brought in a new recruit.

01:33.627 --> 01:36.394
FucktheJews82.
Welcome, brother!

01:36.396 --> 01:38.298
Yeah!

01:39.366 --> 01:41.432
Hi. <i>Heil. Heil,</i> everybody.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.368
White power. Obviously.

01:43.370 --> 01:46.404
Been a big fan of you guys
for a while.

01:46.406 --> 01:47.572
Since World War II, really.

01:47.574 --> 01:51.676
That's when you made your
big entrance, on the scene.

01:51.678 --> 01:55.015
And, uh... Yeah.
Just, um, in closing...

01:56.116 --> 01:58.416
- Fuck the Jews!
- Yeah!

01:58.418 --> 02:00.453
Welcome!

02:02.455 --> 02:03.621
Let's fucking party!

02:13.400 --> 02:15.967
So you guys are, like, pretty
active on social media, right?

02:15.969 --> 02:17.102
Yeah.

02:17.104 --> 02:19.138
How many times a day would you
say you tweet on average?

02:19.140 --> 02:21.739
- Hey, FTJ!
- Yo!

02:21.741 --> 02:24.076
You said you wanted
a swastika tattoo.

02:24.078 --> 02:25.412
Now's your chance.

02:26.513 --> 02:28.981
Yeah, you know, I've been
thinking about it. I'm cool.

02:28.983 --> 02:31.651
Come on, man.
We all got 'em!

02:38.892 --> 02:40.558
You guys want me to get
a swastika tattoo?

02:40.560 --> 02:41.961
Yeah!

02:41.963 --> 02:43.763
I will get a swastika tattoo.

02:44.464 --> 02:45.864
Um...

02:45.866 --> 02:47.034
Yeah.

02:49.636 --> 02:51.805
Hey, take over, man.
I got to take a piss.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.440
Super cool, guys.
Thank you for this.

02:55.442 --> 02:56.610
This is really exciting.

02:57.777 --> 02:59.979
All right, here we go!

03:01.448 --> 03:03.615
Ooh, right! Yeah!

03:03.617 --> 03:05.084
That hurt?

03:05.086 --> 03:07.088
On many levels. Yes.

03:08.856 --> 03:09.924
Fuck!

03:10.758 --> 03:12.927
Hey! This you?

03:14.061 --> 03:15.763
You're a journalist?

03:16.764 --> 03:18.030
Yeah!

03:18.032 --> 03:20.665
We all got to be fucking
journalists in this day and age,

03:20.667 --> 03:23.601
mainstream media not covering
our side of the story!

03:23.603 --> 03:25.637
His name is Fred Flarsky.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.206
He writes for
the <i>Brooklyn Advocate.</i>

03:27.208 --> 03:29.875
- He's a fucking Jew!
- What?

03:29.877 --> 03:32.512
Look, look, look.
Okay, okay, okay. Hey!

03:34.849 --> 03:35.714
What are you doing here?

03:35.716 --> 03:37.182
You're here to fucking
embarrass us, huh?

03:37.184 --> 03:39.151
- Who sent you?
- No one sent me!

03:39.153 --> 03:40.920
It's okay. I'm... I'm...

03:40.922 --> 03:43.656
He's been recording us
the whole time!

03:43.658 --> 03:46.158
Fucking shit, man!
You infiltrated our group!

03:46.160 --> 03:48.060
You're gonna fucking die!

03:48.062 --> 03:48.961
How do you
turn this thing off?

03:48.963 --> 03:50.798
The fucking red button,
right there, man!

03:57.872 --> 03:59.573
Holy shit!

04:06.013 --> 04:09.515
Yeah!

04:09.517 --> 04:11.852
Not only did I escape...

04:13.254 --> 04:15.287
I held onto my phone!

04:15.289 --> 04:17.558
Yes! Ow!

04:19.961 --> 04:21.726
I trusted you, man!

04:21.728 --> 04:23.295
Yeah, well...

04:23.297 --> 04:25.967
Jews win this round,
motherfucker!

04:26.734 --> 04:29.001
Peace! Ow.

04:29.003 --> 04:30.602

<i>You know,

04:51.826 --> 04:53.559

04:54.996 --> 04:56.697

05:00.634 --> 05:02.503
- Good night, Steven.
- Good night, Madam Secretary.

05:06.841 --> 05:08.774
Sorry for the late call,
Mr. Foreign Minister.

05:08.776 --> 05:09.875
Long day.

05:09.877 --> 05:11.344
Three bilaterals.

05:11.346 --> 05:14.113
Listen, we're not going to be
able to do it.

05:14.115 --> 05:16.349
There's just not enough
traction around this thing.

05:16.351 --> 05:19.352
I believe in it, it's just...
I don't have Congress support.

05:19.354 --> 05:21.053
I don't have
the American people's support.

05:21.055 --> 05:23.123
I know you and I
don't like it, Chuck,

05:23.125 --> 05:24.857
but you know who likes it?

05:24.859 --> 05:28.094
88% of college-educated
Americans over 45.

05:28.096 --> 05:29.661
Likely voters.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.932
That's Gallup.
We have to make this happen.

06:07.102 --> 06:10.336
Well, I wouldn't call
the president inexperienced.

06:10.338 --> 06:11.905
I mean,
he did play a president

06:11.907 --> 06:15.741
on a very popular television
show for over a decade.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.977
You don't get
six Golden Globe nominations

06:17.979 --> 06:20.080
without being
pretty convincing.

06:20.082 --> 06:22.648
Um, I do think I'm funny.

06:22.650 --> 06:24.417
I'm sorry, I thought
this interview was about

06:24.419 --> 06:26.886
promoting democracy
in Eastern Europe.

06:26.888 --> 06:28.687
All right, next one's BBC.

06:28.689 --> 06:30.056
<i>Would you be asking
a male cabinet member</i>

06:30.058 --> 06:31.725
<i>what products they use
in their hair?</i>

06:32.327 --> 06:33.993
I'm just kidding.

06:33.995 --> 06:36.396
No, it's olive oil
and mayonnaise.

06:36.398 --> 06:38.865
I know. So cheap.
So much shine.

06:41.870 --> 06:43.803
Good morning, Mr. President.

06:43.805 --> 06:45.307
Good morning,
Mr. President.

06:46.875 --> 06:49.242
Good morning, Mr. President.

06:49.244 --> 06:51.177
Good morning, Mr. President.

06:51.179 --> 06:52.779
Oh, hey, Charlotte.

06:52.781 --> 06:55.849
You caught me
watching my show.

06:55.851 --> 06:58.785
<i>Mr. President. We still
recommend Option C.</i>

06:58.787 --> 07:01.788
<i>I am not nuking a tsunami!</i>

07:01.790 --> 07:03.923
Oh, here it is.

07:03.925 --> 07:05.425
Not now...

07:05.427 --> 07:07.127
Not today.

07:07.129 --> 07:08.761
Not in my house.

07:08.763 --> 07:10.997
Yes! I love that!

07:10.999 --> 07:12.866
Oh, me too.

07:12.868 --> 07:14.934
Anyway, that's not why
I called you here.

07:17.072 --> 07:18.306
Charlotte.

07:18.874 --> 07:19.906
Yes, sir?

07:19.908 --> 07:22.909
I will not be
seeking reelection.

07:22.911 --> 07:24.210
Really?

07:24.212 --> 07:25.979
Look, I know it's crazy,

07:25.981 --> 07:28.014
because I'm only halfway
through my first term.

07:28.016 --> 07:31.084
And you're incredibly
popular, sir.

07:31.086 --> 07:33.186
And I want to use
that popularity

07:33.188 --> 07:36.723
to transition into something

07:36.725 --> 07:39.060
more prestigious
than the presidency.

07:40.295 --> 07:43.029
I wanna make it in the movies.

07:43.031 --> 07:46.199
You're going to leave

07:46.201 --> 07:48.935
the Presidency
to go be in movies?

07:48.937 --> 07:51.171
- I know. It's gonna be tough.
- Ah...

07:51.173 --> 07:53.840
Only like, 10 guys
have made that jump

07:53.842 --> 07:55.775
from TV to film.

07:55.777 --> 07:58.278
Woody Harrelson,
George Clooney...

07:58.280 --> 07:59.979
Might be... Might be just two.

07:59.981 --> 08:03.350
I... Mr. President, have you

08:03.352 --> 08:07.220
given any consideration
as to whom you might endorse?

08:07.222 --> 08:09.290
I'm sure you're probably
thinking of McNichol

08:09.292 --> 08:12.892
or Crowly. Strong choices.

08:12.894 --> 08:16.731
So strange, because I was
considering a run in 2024.

08:17.500 --> 08:19.034
And I've been vetted.

08:19.768 --> 08:21.502
So that's all done.

08:21.504 --> 08:24.940
And I can't stop thinking
about what...

08:26.174 --> 08:28.177
What it would do
for your legacy

08:29.312 --> 08:31.347
to endorse the first
female president.

08:33.249 --> 08:34.916
I mean... Wow.

08:35.351 --> 08:36.352
That's a legacy.

08:39.888 --> 08:41.121
- Charlotte?
- Hmm?

08:41.123 --> 08:43.390
I would like to endorse you

08:43.392 --> 08:45.994
to be the next president
of the United States.

08:48.029 --> 08:51.798
I mean, if you think that's
a good idea, sir, I trust you.

08:51.800 --> 08:54.468
I'd... I'd be honored.

08:54.470 --> 08:58.405
I'm gonna be pulling
for Team Charlotte. Right?

08:58.407 --> 09:00.343
Because you've been
a great secretary.

09:01.043 --> 09:02.243
...of state.

09:02.245 --> 09:04.545
Whatever. It's a cool job.

09:04.547 --> 09:06.913
And, um, you've done it well.

09:06.915 --> 09:09.416
- Thank you, sir.
- So stay focused.

09:09.418 --> 09:10.951
Don't make
any major screw-ups.

09:10.953 --> 09:12.219
Don't kill any hookers.

09:12.221 --> 09:13.520
Probably not a problem for you.

09:13.522 --> 09:15.122
I don't know what you're into.
Whatever.

09:15.124 --> 09:16.991
And before you know it...

09:20.029 --> 09:21.161
I like the sound of that.

09:21.163 --> 09:23.364
<i>♪ Hey, here she comes</i>

09:23.366 --> 09:25.299
<i>♪ It's the first lady president</i>

09:25.301 --> 09:28.035
<i>♪ Who can believe
that she's actually a woman</i>

09:28.037 --> 09:29.570
Thank you, sir.

09:29.572 --> 09:34.310
<i>♪ She's got a big brain
And a couple other assets ♪</i>

09:37.013 --> 09:38.078
Oh, and here we see

09:38.080 --> 09:39.880
Secretary of State
Charlotte Field.

09:39.882 --> 09:41.115
Good morning.

09:42.418 --> 09:43.785
Yes!

09:47.857 --> 09:50.557
So the headline is,
"You're in great shape."

09:50.559 --> 09:53.227
- Ninety-two, that's good.
- Really good.

09:53.229 --> 09:54.928
- Yeah.
- And now, keep in mind

09:54.930 --> 09:57.464
that these are numbers
for a female candidate.

09:57.466 --> 10:00.868
If you were a man, you'd be
in the 192nd percentile.

10:00.870 --> 10:03.037
- Well, that seems about right.
- Yeah.

10:03.039 --> 10:05.139
'Cause the man... Okay.

10:05.141 --> 10:08.175
Um, your sense of humor is 82,

10:08.177 --> 10:10.444
which is solid. It's solid.

10:10.446 --> 10:12.546
But, you know, we wouldn't
mind seeing those numbers

10:12.548 --> 10:14.915
go up a few points, or more.

10:14.917 --> 10:17.117
So, I'm going to get
some writing samples from

10:17.119 --> 10:18.653
- some funny speech writers.
- Great.

10:18.655 --> 10:21.989
I am really interested
in knowing how people feel

10:21.991 --> 10:23.924
- about my accomplishments.
- Yeah.

10:23.926 --> 10:25.559
Right. You know, so we don't

10:25.561 --> 10:29.564
drill down
on specific policies.

10:29.566 --> 10:32.667
And that's only because
people don't seem to care.

10:32.669 --> 10:34.068
That's interesting.

10:34.070 --> 10:37.438
With that said, if you could
broker some deal

10:37.440 --> 10:38.972
that gets you
out there talking

10:38.974 --> 10:40.341
about a thing that you feel

10:40.343 --> 10:42.476
really strongly about,
that would be great.

10:42.478 --> 10:43.410
Well, that's perfect.

10:43.412 --> 10:45.513
I mean, we've been
looking for an opening

10:45.515 --> 10:47.450
to start a conversation
about the environment.

10:48.250 --> 10:50.918
All right.

10:50.920 --> 10:53.688
Romantically, if I may...

10:53.690 --> 10:56.691
Remember the stir online

10:56.693 --> 10:59.293
when the Canadian
Prime Minister and you

10:59.295 --> 11:01.195
were seated next to each other

11:01.197 --> 11:02.697
at The Global Business Forum?

11:02.699 --> 11:04.098
Mmm-hmm.

11:04.100 --> 11:06.233
A relationship like that

11:06.235 --> 11:09.004
would push you
into the high 90s.

11:09.439 --> 11:12.072
High 90s? Wow.

11:12.074 --> 11:13.410
That brings us to...

11:17.146 --> 11:19.079
What's wrong
with my wave?

11:19.081 --> 11:21.081
Um, I think people feel that

11:21.083 --> 11:24.118
that level of elbow movement
is, um...

11:24.120 --> 11:25.620
It stresses people out.

11:25.622 --> 11:28.623
You know what? It's just
an area for improvement.

11:28.625 --> 11:30.392
Okay, fine,
I'll work on the wave.

11:34.631 --> 11:36.264
- Hey.
- Hey, Fred.

11:36.266 --> 11:38.968
You're gonna love this.
I almost died.

11:39.403 --> 11:41.001
You got a second?

11:41.003 --> 11:43.671
- Yeah.
- Come on.

11:43.673 --> 11:46.173
I actually have
some really great news.

11:46.175 --> 11:48.343
- Really? Cool.
- Yes.

11:48.345 --> 11:50.678
We were just bought
by Wembley Media.

11:50.680 --> 11:52.647
- What?
- Yeah.

11:52.649 --> 11:53.548
Are you fucking kidding me?

11:53.550 --> 11:55.015
I knew you'd have
a harsh reaction...

11:55.017 --> 11:56.184
A harsh reaction?

11:56.186 --> 11:57.619
- Fred, this is a good thing.
- How?

11:57.621 --> 11:59.220
The fucker
represents everything

11:59.222 --> 12:00.688
that we've been fighting
against since day one!

12:00.690 --> 12:03.591
The whole point of this paper is
to fight giant media conglomerates.

12:03.593 --> 12:05.393
Now we've been bought
by a giant media conglomerate.

12:05.395 --> 12:07.662
- I do see the irony.
- Irony?

12:07.664 --> 12:10.331
He's gonna turn this place
into a propaganda machine.

12:10.333 --> 12:12.200
Not the good kind,
that's right!

12:12.202 --> 12:14.001
The bad kind, that's wrong!

12:14.003 --> 12:15.370
Well, we're out of options.

12:15.372 --> 12:17.105
We've been running
as long as we can

12:17.107 --> 12:19.507
on ads for weed doctors
and escorts.

12:19.509 --> 12:21.609
Let's get penis enlargement
ads, too.

12:21.611 --> 12:23.077
No one likes their dick.

12:23.079 --> 12:25.046
- Come on, Fred.
- This Wembley guy,

12:25.048 --> 12:27.582
he ran fake stories
to help get Chambers elected.

12:27.584 --> 12:28.550
No, they couldn't prove that.

12:28.552 --> 12:30.752
We proved it! I wrote
three articles about it!

12:30.754 --> 12:32.654
- You published them!
- I did.

12:32.656 --> 12:35.356
The shit that comes out
of this fucking guy's mouth...

12:35.358 --> 12:38.059
He said hurricanes were
caused by gay marriage.

12:38.061 --> 12:39.661
I don't even get
how that fucking works.

12:39.663 --> 12:41.262
I don't even get
the math on that one.

12:41.264 --> 12:43.331
- Fred, it's done, all right?
- It's done?

12:43.333 --> 12:46.801
They're upstairs finalizing
the deal right now.

12:46.803 --> 12:49.571
Look, we have to cut
two-thirds of our staff.

12:49.573 --> 12:51.606
- Two-thirds?
- Yeah.

12:51.608 --> 12:54.042
But we wanna keep you on.
They wanna keep you on.

12:54.044 --> 12:55.443
It's just...

12:55.445 --> 12:57.345
You just have to
tone it down a little bit.

12:57.347 --> 12:58.814
I don't know how I can
tone things down

12:58.816 --> 13:00.482
any more than
I'm toning them down.

13:00.484 --> 13:02.484
Okay, Fred.
You're a great writer.

13:02.486 --> 13:03.651
- Thank you.
- All right, you're funny,

13:03.653 --> 13:05.353
you take risks,
you connect with people.

13:05.355 --> 13:06.621
I'm sensing a twist in this.

13:06.623 --> 13:08.625
You have a distinct,
authentic voice, but...

13:09.759 --> 13:11.626
Sometimes you're
a little too much.

13:11.628 --> 13:12.660
I don't think I am too much!

13:12.662 --> 13:15.163
I actually think I'm
the perfect right portion.

13:15.165 --> 13:16.664
Look, you have your job.

13:16.666 --> 13:19.501
Okay, focus on that and just
toe the line a little bit.

13:19.503 --> 13:21.102
You know what? I quit.

13:21.104 --> 13:22.237
Oh, come on, Fred.

13:22.239 --> 13:24.239
You should quit, too.
Everyone should fucking quit.

13:24.241 --> 13:26.174
No, I'm not gonna quit,
I need my job.

13:26.176 --> 13:28.276
I need my fucking job, too.
I'm broke, man!

13:28.278 --> 13:29.678
But I can't work for that guy.

13:29.680 --> 13:32.080
At least let me fire you
so you can get unemployment.

13:32.082 --> 13:34.148
No fucking way!

13:34.150 --> 13:36.284
I want him to know
that I quit.

13:36.286 --> 13:38.621
He's never gonna know it,
he's never heard of you.

13:38.623 --> 13:41.189
You're gonna destroy your life to
spite a guy who's never heard of you?

13:41.191 --> 13:42.758
Yes! You said it best!

13:42.760 --> 13:43.926
That's exactly
what I'm doing.

13:43.928 --> 13:46.729
You're making bad decisions
and it's bumming me out, man.

13:46.731 --> 13:48.196
Well, that makes
two of us.

13:48.198 --> 13:51.767
Fuck this.
Journalism died today, people.

13:51.769 --> 13:54.737
Yes, hello, this is, uh,
Fred Flarsky.

13:54.739 --> 13:56.672
Um... I, uh,

13:56.674 --> 13:58.239
was just calling to say
that I was forced

13:58.241 --> 13:59.507
<i>to quit my job recently,</i>

13:59.509 --> 14:01.209
<i>making me
something of a free agent.</i>

14:01.211 --> 14:02.778
<i>And I know in the past, uh,</i>

14:02.780 --> 14:05.481
<i>you said I'm not exactly what</i>
The Times <i>was looking for,</i>

14:05.483 --> 14:08.149
<i>but I was just calling
to see if anything's changed.</i>

14:08.151 --> 14:10.285
<i>Uh, just give me a ring.
Thank you so much.</i>

14:10.287 --> 14:12.490
Yo, Lance. It's Fred. Um...

14:14.224 --> 14:15.524
I lost my job
and I'm very sad.

14:15.526 --> 14:17.125
Can I come by?

14:22.466 --> 14:23.732
We need to
schedule a meeting

14:23.734 --> 14:25.734
and see what they have to say.

14:25.736 --> 14:27.270
Excuse me.

14:28.439 --> 14:31.239
Man, I can't believe
they did you like that.

14:31.241 --> 14:32.875
It's fucked up. I'm pissed.

14:32.877 --> 14:34.810
But you're gonna feel a lot
better, man, we're leaving.

14:34.812 --> 14:36.512
You can leave work right now?

14:36.514 --> 14:38.581
Yeah, I can fucking leave.
You see this corner office?

14:38.583 --> 14:39.848
That's a
"I can leave this bitch

14:39.850 --> 14:41.817
"whenever I want"
corner office.

14:41.819 --> 14:43.354
Come on, man. Everybody!

14:44.522 --> 14:46.254
This is my best friend,

14:46.256 --> 14:47.790
and he just
lost his job today.

14:47.792 --> 14:49.658
All right?
He's at rock bottom.

14:49.660 --> 14:51.860
- It's not that bad.
- He feels like shit.

14:51.862 --> 14:53.529
And I'm gonna
make him feel better.

14:53.531 --> 14:55.229
It's been a tradition
since we were in college,

14:55.231 --> 14:56.599
when one of us feels sad,

14:56.601 --> 14:58.334
the other one
has to get him fucked up.

14:58.336 --> 15:02.504
I'm talking Britney Spears,
mid-2000s bald head,

15:02.506 --> 15:04.773
almost dropping the baby
fucked up.

15:04.775 --> 15:06.875
No judgement. No judgement.

15:06.877 --> 15:09.244
I need my schedule cleared,
Zander.

15:09.246 --> 15:10.346
I don't want to do shit.

15:10.348 --> 15:12.581
I'm going off-grid
till tomorrow.

15:12.583 --> 15:13.651
Matter of fact...

15:14.752 --> 15:16.685
Everybody's got the day off.

15:16.687 --> 15:19.188
Everybody's got the day off.
Y'all got the day off.

15:19.190 --> 15:20.289
Everybody, go home.

15:20.291 --> 15:22.958
I'm so appreciative
of all of you guys' hard work.

15:22.960 --> 15:24.693
I love
every single one of you.

15:24.695 --> 15:25.761
Except you, Ted!

15:25.763 --> 15:28.864
Bagel Friday
is for everybody, Ted!

15:28.866 --> 15:30.966
You don't think we know
you taking the bagels?

15:30.968 --> 15:32.334
Yeah, Ted, not cool.

15:32.336 --> 15:33.268
- Zander.
- Yeah?

15:33.270 --> 15:35.504
I need two cans
of the Pamplemousse LaCroix.

15:35.506 --> 15:36.739
- Uh-huh.
- I need that filled

15:36.741 --> 15:39.274
with Johnnie Walker Blue
and CBD oil.

15:39.276 --> 15:40.444
Do you want one?

15:41.812 --> 15:43.479
I got fucked, man.

15:43.481 --> 15:46.215
Yeah, you got fucked
like a stepmom on Pornhub.

15:46.217 --> 15:47.383
Well, it happens to everybody.

15:47.385 --> 15:49.318
I've been unemployed before,
it sucks.

15:49.320 --> 15:50.586
But I didn't ask
for any handouts.

15:50.588 --> 15:53.389
I picked myself up by
my bootstraps and got to it.

15:53.391 --> 15:54.823
Where are we going right now?

15:54.825 --> 15:56.625
Best day ever, Fred.
Don't worry about it.

15:56.627 --> 15:58.794
I've got this dope afternoon
planned for us.

15:58.796 --> 16:00.596
First we're going to finish
these Pamplemousse's.

16:00.598 --> 16:01.563
Play at the park.

16:01.565 --> 16:03.599
After that we're going to
go to Peter Luger's,

16:03.601 --> 16:04.767
get you a nice fat steak,

16:04.769 --> 16:07.469
and then finish it off with
a World Wildlife Fund benefit.

16:07.471 --> 16:08.837
I don't know if I
want to go to some

16:08.839 --> 16:10.406
fancy rich person party.

16:10.408 --> 16:11.740
What... Oh, come on, man,

16:11.742 --> 16:13.342
don't be so judgmental,
all right?

16:13.344 --> 16:15.744
It's free booze and
there'll be pandas and shit.

16:15.746 --> 16:18.280
- People love pandas and shit.
- I don't know.

16:18.282 --> 16:19.515
All right, fine, Fred.

16:19.517 --> 16:20.917
Then just do nothing.
All right?

16:20.919 --> 16:22.852
Go home, do nothing.

16:22.854 --> 16:25.423
And don't kick it with your
best friend and Boyz II Men.

16:26.557 --> 16:27.791
Say what?

16:27.793 --> 16:29.525
Oh, yeah.

16:29.527 --> 16:30.994
Boyz II Men is bringing
their timeless blend

16:30.996 --> 16:34.263
of R&B, hip-hop and
new jack swing to the party.

16:34.265 --> 16:36.265
I thought you would
like to be there.

16:36.267 --> 16:37.967
Bo-bo-bo-Boyz II Men?

16:37.969 --> 16:41.037
<i>♪ Motownphilly's back again</i>

16:42.140 --> 16:43.039
That's what I'm talking about,
man. Let's do this shit.

16:43.041 --> 16:45.008
Okay, let's have fun.
What a fun day.

16:46.978 --> 16:50.612
I am so hungry,
it's insane.

16:50.614 --> 16:51.848
Why didn't you
PowerBar me?

16:51.850 --> 16:53.348
I tried,
you pushed my hand away.

16:53.350 --> 16:54.516
Oh.

16:54.518 --> 16:57.519
Skewered foods. I can't eat
skewered foods gracefully.

16:57.521 --> 16:58.922
I look like
a fucking caveman.

16:58.924 --> 17:00.690
Yeah, and there are
cameras everywhere.

17:00.692 --> 17:02.524
That's really gonna hurt
your elegance score.

17:02.526 --> 17:03.595
That's my best score.

17:07.999 --> 17:09.933
Fuck! It's all
skewered foods.

17:09.935 --> 17:11.601
I'm gonna take the chicken
off the skewers.

17:11.603 --> 17:13.535
- Take it off...
- Quickly. Quickly.

17:13.537 --> 17:15.503
Why do they make this
so difficult...

17:15.506 --> 17:17.840
Oh. I'm sorry, sir.
I apologize.

17:17.843 --> 17:20.409
- Jesus fucking Christ.
- Can't do things...

17:20.411 --> 17:22.377
Just make a fucking...
Make a wall. Make a wall.

17:22.378 --> 17:24.248
- Yup. Yes.
- Do you have it?

17:27.417 --> 17:29.018
Good. Good, good,
good, good.

17:29.020 --> 17:30.822
Oh, my God,
it's really good chicken.

17:32.457 --> 17:34.023
James Steward is approaching.
James Steward is approaching.

17:34.025 --> 17:35.091
What?

17:35.093 --> 17:36.860
Okay, he's about
nine feet away.

17:36.862 --> 17:38.895
His dick is probably
about seven feet away.

17:38.897 --> 17:40.663
- Maggie!
- Six feet away.

17:40.665 --> 17:42.534
Five feet away.
Spit, spit, spit, spit, spit.

17:43.902 --> 17:45.935
- James!
- <i>Bonsoir.</i>

17:45.937 --> 17:47.771
- Hi.
- Good evening.

17:47.773 --> 17:49.439
I am so sorry I missed you

17:49.441 --> 17:51.107
when I was at the White House
a few weeks ago.

17:51.109 --> 17:54.043
Oh, are you so "sorry," James?

17:54.045 --> 17:55.578
You're never gonna

17:55.580 --> 17:56.913
stop making that joke,
are you?

17:56.915 --> 17:59.048
No. I'm not.

17:59.050 --> 18:00.517
Well, I... Oh, hello.

18:00.519 --> 18:01.818
- Hi.
- Oh, yes.

18:01.820 --> 18:03.622
Thank you.

18:04.990 --> 18:07.025
- One more. One more.
- One more.

18:08.126 --> 18:10.493
<i>Merci.</i> Thank you.

18:10.495 --> 18:11.663
What do you say
we get out of here?

18:13.031 --> 18:15.799
Grab a drink somewhere
a bit more private.

18:17.936 --> 18:19.135
- Yes...
- Yeah?

18:19.137 --> 18:21.404
Oh, my God!

18:21.406 --> 18:23.139
<i>Make some noise out there!
Make some noise!</i>

18:23.141 --> 18:25.441
<i>Yeah! Check it out, y'all!</i>

18:25.443 --> 18:27.577
<i>One question,
what's the name of the group?</i>

18:27.579 --> 18:28.845
Boyz II Men!

18:28.847 --> 18:29.712
<i>What's the name
of the group, y'all?</i>

18:29.714 --> 18:31.047
Boyz II Men!

18:52.938 --> 18:54.003
Yeah...

18:54.005 --> 18:55.039
I told you this
would be dope.

18:55.041 --> 18:58.108
Yeah, uh...
This is really cheering me up.

18:58.110 --> 18:59.542
Wow.

19:09.155 --> 19:10.587
I'm super underdressed.

19:10.589 --> 19:11.888
Stop complaining,
all right?

19:11.890 --> 19:13.823
You think
you feel outta place?

19:13.825 --> 19:14.992
This is one of
the brightest rooms

19:14.994 --> 19:17.027
I've ever been in,
in my life.

19:17.029 --> 19:18.830
Bright?
What do you mean, bright?

19:19.431 --> 19:20.663
Like white.

19:20.665 --> 19:22.732
- Oh, "bright" is white?
- Yeah, man.

19:22.734 --> 19:24.801
It's only me,
the waiters and Boyz II Men.

19:24.803 --> 19:26.669
I've already had three people
tell me they love my music.

19:32.611 --> 19:33.844
Duty calls.

19:33.846 --> 19:36.213
I'll take a snow check
on that dance.

19:36.215 --> 19:38.815
- Canadian for "rain check."
- Okay.

19:38.817 --> 19:40.853
Okay.

19:47.827 --> 19:49.960
Man, you're pounding 'em
kinda hard, don't you think?

19:49.962 --> 19:52.029
I got fired today, man.

19:52.031 --> 19:53.398
You told me you quit.

19:54.800 --> 19:56.901
I was forced to quit
because of...

19:56.903 --> 19:58.035
Yeah, okay, man.

19:58.037 --> 19:59.404
Lie to me some more.

20:01.240 --> 20:02.507
You good?

20:07.780 --> 20:09.949
Shit. Is the secretary
of state looking at us?

20:11.884 --> 20:13.085
Oh, she's looking at you?

20:15.087 --> 20:16.454
Fred.

20:19.591 --> 20:21.727
Fred. What the hell?
What was that?

20:22.762 --> 20:24.630
Damn. Hey, what was that?

20:25.898 --> 20:27.497
I...

20:27.499 --> 20:28.899
Kinda... I kinda know her.
Okay?

20:28.901 --> 20:30.834
- You kinda know her?
- Yeah.

20:30.836 --> 20:32.569
Nobody kinda knows
Charlotte Field, all right?

20:32.571 --> 20:33.971
It's like kinda knowing
a mermaid, dude.

20:33.973 --> 20:35.105
You tell people that shit.

20:35.107 --> 20:36.774
- That's exceptional.
- Okay.

20:36.776 --> 20:38.075
I'll tell you a story.

20:38.077 --> 20:41.812
So, I'm like 13,
she's like 16.

20:41.814 --> 20:43.149
She's my babysitter.

20:48.721 --> 20:51.255
<i>She's like, perfect.
She's very nice to me,</i>

20:51.257 --> 20:52.790
<i>which goes a long way with me.</i>

20:52.792 --> 20:54.224
So, we're at her house...

20:54.226 --> 20:56.160
She's practicing a speech
that she's writing.

20:56.162 --> 20:58.128
<i>She's running for
Student Council president.</i>

20:58.130 --> 20:59.431
Did you know
that every year,

20:59.433 --> 21:02.266
the school throws away over
500 tons of recyclable garbage?

21:02.268 --> 21:05.102
- And no one cares.
- I know, it's total bullshit.

21:05.104 --> 21:06.704
But how do you get idiots
to care about shit

21:06.706 --> 21:09.807
- they don't care about?
- They'll just care

21:09.809 --> 21:11.842
because it's the right thing
to care about.

21:11.844 --> 21:14.845
You're more inspiring than George
Bush and Dan Quayle combined.

21:14.847 --> 21:16.613
Well, that's not too hard.

21:18.050 --> 21:19.783
<i>Well, she was amazing,
and she was smart,</i>

21:19.785 --> 21:21.118
<i>and she seemed to
kinda like me,</i>

21:21.120 --> 21:22.886
<i>and I felt like
we were having a moment.</i>

21:22.888 --> 21:25.055
You know what I mean?
Like a romantic moment.

21:25.057 --> 21:26.123
Oh, shit.

21:26.125 --> 21:27.725
<i>So I did something,</i>

21:27.727 --> 21:29.827
<i>that in retrospect
was highly inappropriate.</i>

21:29.829 --> 21:31.130
<i>I kissed her.</i>

21:31.797 --> 21:33.130
I looked down...

21:33.132 --> 21:35.300
<i>I got a fucking
13-year-old boner, man!</i>

21:35.302 --> 21:38.135
- Oh!
- Hard... But not big.

21:38.137 --> 21:40.938
But hard. And pronounced,
"13-year-old boner."

21:40.940 --> 21:41.939
Sorry.

21:41.941 --> 21:43.909
And she looks at it.
She sees it. And she goes...

21:44.677 --> 21:45.743
It's okay.

21:45.745 --> 21:47.245
And then,

21:47.247 --> 21:49.113
her boyfriend comes
into the room,

21:49.115 --> 21:50.814
who was in the other room
watching <i>Blossom!</i>

21:50.816 --> 21:51.882
Hey, babe.

21:51.884 --> 21:53.751
Points out my fucking
little boner.

21:53.753 --> 21:56.154
- <i>He makes a joke!</i>
- Whoa!

21:56.156 --> 21:57.690
<i>And they left.</i>

21:58.325 --> 21:59.859
I'm sorry.

22:01.894 --> 22:04.964
And I'm left
standing there alone...

22:05.798 --> 22:06.764
...in the kitchen,

22:06.766 --> 22:09.767
with my little, hard
13-year-old fucking boner.

22:09.769 --> 22:11.935
- Hard as a rock.
- And on top of that,

22:11.937 --> 22:13.604
she didn't win
the fucking election.

22:13.606 --> 22:16.307
Bill Sterling won because
he ran on a two-prom platform.

22:16.309 --> 22:19.344
- Two-prom!
- Two-proms! Back-to-back!

22:19.346 --> 22:21.712
She didn't stand
a fucking chance.

22:21.714 --> 22:22.846
No, man.

22:22.848 --> 22:24.882
I think you're skimming over
the best part of that story.

22:24.884 --> 22:26.617
What's the best part
of that story?

22:26.619 --> 22:28.386
She says your boner was okay.

22:28.388 --> 22:30.188
She said, "It's okay,"
like she was trying

22:30.190 --> 22:32.023
to not make me
fucking feel bad.

22:32.025 --> 22:34.025
Fred, you see
a fucked-up story,

22:34.027 --> 22:37.761
when I see a beautiful story
about a girl that you liked,

22:37.763 --> 22:40.898
liking your boner
in all of its okay-ness.

22:40.900 --> 22:42.967
You need
to talk to her tonight.

22:42.969 --> 22:44.235
She probably doesn't remember
who I am,

22:44.237 --> 22:45.937
and if she does remember
who I am,

22:45.939 --> 22:47.105
the last thing she wants is

22:47.107 --> 22:49.207
my 13-year-old-boner-having
fucking ass walking up to her.

22:49.209 --> 22:50.275
- Look...
- Excuse me.

22:50.277 --> 22:51.309
Whoa.

22:51.311 --> 22:52.977
Secretary Field would
like to speak with you.

22:52.979 --> 22:54.212
With me?

22:54.214 --> 22:55.646
With him, right?

22:55.648 --> 22:57.415
- Yeah.
- Right now?

22:57.417 --> 22:59.017
Uh, do you know why?

22:59.019 --> 23:00.120
This way.

23:01.221 --> 23:02.387
This is good.

23:02.389 --> 23:03.822
What are you
nervous about?

23:03.824 --> 23:06.091
What the fuck?
Everything I just said!

23:15.734 --> 23:17.701
Oh, my God, dude,
there she is.

23:26.246 --> 23:28.079
What are you gonna
say to her?

23:28.081 --> 23:29.681
I don't know.

23:29.683 --> 23:31.049
Should open with a neg.

23:31.051 --> 23:32.350
Tell her she's too tall.

23:32.352 --> 23:34.252
I'm not gonna neg
the secretary of state.

23:34.254 --> 23:36.189
- It was so nice to see you.
- You as well.

23:38.325 --> 23:41.126
Give me the signal
when you need me.

23:41.128 --> 23:43.261
- Hi.
- Hi.

23:43.263 --> 23:44.696
A man brought me here.

23:44.698 --> 23:46.231
Yes, sorry about that.

23:46.233 --> 23:47.265
- Um...
- No, not at all.

23:47.267 --> 23:50.135
I can't shake this feeling
that we know each other.

23:50.137 --> 23:51.769
- We do. Yeah.
- We do?

23:51.771 --> 23:53.171
- We do know each other.
- Okay, so I'm not crazy.

23:53.173 --> 23:55.473
- Uh, I'm Fred.
- Fred...

23:55.475 --> 23:56.774
I was shorter,

23:56.776 --> 23:58.209
- but other than that...
- Flarsky?

23:58.211 --> 23:59.277
Yeah! Holy fuck!

23:59.279 --> 24:00.979
I can't believe it.
You remember.

24:00.981 --> 24:03.248
Oh, my God,
look at you!

24:03.250 --> 24:04.449
Look at me, yes.

24:04.451 --> 24:05.717
What are you doing here?

24:05.719 --> 24:08.219
My friend, Lance...
That's Lance.

24:08.221 --> 24:09.254
Hey, how you doing?

24:09.256 --> 24:11.923
He, uh, he just brought me
here to see Boyz II Men.

24:11.925 --> 24:13.057
I just met them.

24:13.059 --> 24:14.893
- You met the Men?
- Yeah.

24:14.895 --> 24:16.495
- What was it like?
- Don't tell anybody,

24:16.497 --> 24:17.996
but it was
the highlight of my life.

24:17.998 --> 24:19.130
Oh, I totally get that.

24:19.132 --> 24:20.131
And I've met
the Dalai Lama.

24:20.133 --> 24:22.800
Fuck him. How many hits
does he have? None.

24:22.802 --> 24:24.736
Don't actually fuck him.

24:24.738 --> 24:25.870
- He's a wonderful man.
- Yeah.

24:25.872 --> 24:27.305
What are you doing
these days?

24:27.307 --> 24:29.176
I bet it's
something amazing.

24:30.911 --> 24:32.177
- It's pretty amazing.
- Yeah.

24:32.179 --> 24:33.244
Uh, yeah,

24:33.246 --> 24:35.847
but it's still in its, uh,
gestation period, I guess.

24:35.849 --> 24:37.015
I don't need to get into it.

24:37.017 --> 24:38.118
What about you,
what have you been up to?

24:39.085 --> 24:40.251
You're the secretary...
I'm joking.

24:40.253 --> 24:41.387
I know what
you've been up to.

24:41.389 --> 24:42.588
- Yeah.
- You're very, um...

24:42.590 --> 24:44.956
You know, I just, I... I just
wanna say it's, like, amazing

24:44.958 --> 24:46.024
to see what you've done
with your life.

24:46.026 --> 24:47.158
A lot of people say
they're gonna do

24:47.160 --> 24:49.260
all this incredible stuff
and they don't do anything,

24:49.262 --> 24:51.898
but you actually did it all,
so, congrats.

24:53.267 --> 24:55.233
Well, I'm trying.

24:55.235 --> 24:56.770
I think you've done it.

24:58.439 --> 24:59.739
Oh!

25:00.907 --> 25:02.208
Parker Wembley.

25:02.210 --> 25:03.475
I hate this guy.

25:03.477 --> 25:06.110
Parker Wembley, the guy
who buys and sells newspapers

25:06.112 --> 25:08.214
and thinks that hurricanes
are caused by gay marriage?

25:08.216 --> 25:09.281
You know him?

25:09.283 --> 25:10.482
He's coming over here.

25:10.484 --> 25:12.251
- Is he behind me?
- Yeah.

25:12.253 --> 25:15.853
- Finally. Secretary Field.
- Parker, how are you?

25:15.855 --> 25:18.022
You are looking
particularly gorgeous tonight.

25:18.024 --> 25:19.325
Thank you.

25:19.327 --> 25:21.493
I... I've been trying
to set a meeting with you

25:21.495 --> 25:24.096
for some months now,
and, uh...

25:24.098 --> 25:25.863
I mean, have you been
avoiding me?

25:25.865 --> 25:28.866
No! No.

25:28.868 --> 25:31.004
Not successfully.

25:32.473 --> 25:35.039
Who's your friend?

25:35.041 --> 25:36.908
- Fred.
- Hey, Fred!

25:36.910 --> 25:37.976
- Yes, hi.
- How are you?

25:37.978 --> 25:39.944
And, uh, what is it
that you do?

25:39.946 --> 25:41.980
I'm a journalist,
actually. Yeah.

25:41.982 --> 25:43.815
- Ooh, a journalist.
- Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

25:43.817 --> 25:46.218
Will I have read
anything that you've written?

25:46.220 --> 25:49.021
Probably not recently 'cause
I'm unemployed at the moment.

25:49.023 --> 25:50.922
Oh, I am so sorry
to hear that.

25:50.924 --> 25:52.191
Not your fault.

25:52.193 --> 25:54.126
Excuse me, Secretary Field,
we need a word.

25:54.128 --> 25:56.195
- Oh, okay.
- So we will have that meeting.

25:56.197 --> 25:57.263
- Right?
- Yes.

25:57.265 --> 25:58.998
Okay, good. Fred.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.165
- Yes?
- Best of luck.

26:00.167 --> 26:01.233
Oh, why, thanks.

26:01.235 --> 26:02.301
Things will turn around
for you.

26:02.303 --> 26:03.202
So nice of you.

26:03.204 --> 26:05.006
Darkest before the dawn
and all that.

26:06.540 --> 26:09.008
- I actually... I do have to...
- Yeah.

26:09.010 --> 26:10.376
You probably have a lot
of things to do.

26:10.378 --> 26:11.443
Better than this.

26:11.445 --> 26:12.578
It's really nice
to see you again.

26:12.580 --> 26:16.115
Oh. Yeah. Okay. Sure. Great.

26:16.117 --> 26:19.151
Oh, you're backless.
Wasn't expecting that.

26:19.153 --> 26:21.020
- Have fun at the party.
- You too.

26:21.022 --> 26:22.156
Great to see you.

26:25.226 --> 26:28.193
I see you. I see you. Yeah.

26:30.631 --> 26:33.067
So I said,
"You want..."

26:34.568 --> 26:35.968
Hey. Hey.
What's that look in your eye?

26:35.970 --> 26:37.036
What are you
about to go do?

26:37.038 --> 26:38.871
Tonight is
about the animals, dude.

26:38.873 --> 26:40.873
Fuck the animals!
They're fucking gone, man.

26:40.875 --> 26:42.574
Too late
for the fucking animals.

26:44.412 --> 26:46.078
Hey!

26:46.080 --> 26:47.579
- Oh, Fred?
- Yeah, look.

26:47.581 --> 26:49.915
- What's the problem?
- I'll tell you the problem.

26:49.917 --> 26:51.450
- What?
- You're the problem, man!

26:51.452 --> 26:54.019
You're everything that's wrong
with this fucking country.

26:54.021 --> 26:57.256
'Cause you're an old,
rich, white piece of shit

26:57.258 --> 26:59.992
and your media conglomerate
is ruining this planet!

26:59.994 --> 27:01.927
- Enough.
- I'm done anyway.

27:01.929 --> 27:03.595
I had more time with you
than I thought I would,

27:03.597 --> 27:05.230
so joke's on you.
Excuse me, thank you.

27:05.232 --> 27:06.899
Whoa, shit!

27:09.337 --> 27:10.570
God!

27:12.106 --> 27:13.272
<i>Cracker down!</i>

27:13.274 --> 27:14.674
Oh, my God.

27:14.676 --> 27:16.010
Looks like it hurt.

27:16.645 --> 27:18.510
Boyz II Men, back up.

27:18.512 --> 27:19.978
You all right? You good?

27:19.980 --> 27:21.146
- You all right?
- I'm okay!

27:21.148 --> 27:22.214
He's okay!

27:22.216 --> 27:23.351
How is he standing?

27:29.957 --> 27:32.059
- Oh!
- Ouch!

27:34.095 --> 27:37.930
<i>♪ Oh, no
That's the Ruff Ryder...</i>

27:37.932 --> 27:38.997
This is so creative.

27:41.335 --> 27:42.569
Ha-ha!

27:42.571 --> 27:44.138
- What was that?
- Thank you, Tom.

27:44.639 --> 27:46.972
God, that was crazy.

27:46.974 --> 27:48.340
I mean,
now that we know he's okay,

27:48.342 --> 27:51.009
it was all so hilarious.

27:51.011 --> 27:53.613
And so what is
the relationship exactly?

27:53.615 --> 27:55.247
- Was he your super?
- No,

27:55.249 --> 27:57.182
we grew up
next door to each other.

27:57.184 --> 27:58.451
Yeah.

27:58.453 --> 28:01.321
Fuck,
I used to babysit for him.

28:01.323 --> 28:03.556
- You babysat for him?
- I did.

28:03.558 --> 28:06.225
Wow. Time has not been kind.

28:06.227 --> 28:07.226
He was
such a strange little kid.

28:07.228 --> 28:10.430
But he was really funny.
And he was super smart.

28:10.432 --> 28:12.499
He did have this chip
on his shoulder, though.

28:12.501 --> 28:14.534
He's actually
not a bad writer.

28:14.536 --> 28:15.968
Wait, you've read
his stuff?

28:15.970 --> 28:17.169
Yeah, <i>Brooklyn Advocate.</i>

28:17.171 --> 28:19.472
Oh, God, of course,
you read that, Tom.

28:19.474 --> 28:21.241
Didn't that paper
just get sold off?

28:21.243 --> 28:22.609
Wembley Media
just bought them.

28:22.611 --> 28:25.177
Oh, that makes total sense.

28:25.179 --> 28:27.380
That's why he was
such a dick to Wembley.

28:27.382 --> 28:31.386
So the rest of the schedule
for the day is pretty packed.

28:41.696 --> 28:43.028
- Hi.
- Hey.

28:43.030 --> 28:45.732
Did you like
any of those writing samples?

28:45.734 --> 28:48.601
Yeah, McKenzie is good.
Bess is solid.

28:48.603 --> 28:53.139
And, um,
Fred's stuff isn't too bad.

28:53.141 --> 28:55.108
Wait, not the...

28:55.110 --> 28:57.577
The homeless person
that fell down the stairs?

28:57.579 --> 29:00.180
Yeah. He has a real voice.

29:00.182 --> 29:02.782
And he knows me.
I mean, he knew me.

29:02.784 --> 29:04.451
And that's probably
a good thing

29:04.453 --> 29:07.353
if he's going to be
writing for me.

29:07.355 --> 29:09.389
Bringing someone like that
onto the team,

29:09.391 --> 29:12.091
I have to say,
feels a little reckless.

29:12.093 --> 29:15.562
His writing is really good.
And it's funny.

29:15.564 --> 29:17.597
I think he can get that
number up by a few points.

29:17.599 --> 29:19.301
And if he doesn't,
we fire him.

29:20.168 --> 29:21.234
Okay.

29:21.236 --> 29:22.237
Okay.

29:22.771 --> 29:24.239
Fred Flarsky it is.

29:24.673 --> 29:26.041
Thanks.

29:31.213 --> 29:32.214
All right, bye.

29:38.653 --> 29:40.286
Unknown!

29:40.288 --> 29:42.088
I don't give a fuck.
Answer that shit.

29:42.090 --> 29:43.456
- What?
- Answer it!

29:43.458 --> 29:45.091
What if it's The Man
trying to get at me?

29:45.093 --> 29:46.794
No, it's the universe
trying to talk to you.

29:46.796 --> 29:48.061
Really?

29:48.063 --> 29:49.529
- Gang.
- Gang.

29:49.531 --> 29:51.297
Do that shit, man.
Fred, don't fuck with me.

29:51.299 --> 29:52.833
All right. Hello. Gang.

29:52.835 --> 29:54.667
- Mr. Flarsky?
- <i>What?</i>

29:54.669 --> 29:56.202
Wait, slow down. What?

29:56.204 --> 29:58.104
- <i>You're unknown. Pardon?</i>
- Oh, my God. Mr. Flarsky.

29:58.106 --> 30:00.206
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Go on.

30:00.208 --> 30:03.811
This is Maggie Millikin
from Secretary Field's office.

30:03.813 --> 30:06.112
Hello, Maggie,
who works for Secretary Field.

30:06.114 --> 30:07.781
- Whoo!
- <i>Hello?</i>

30:07.783 --> 30:09.082
That's good!
Talk to her.

30:09.084 --> 30:11.752
- <i>Hello?</i>
- How can I help you?

30:11.754 --> 30:13.721
The secretary would like
to meet with you immediately.

30:13.723 --> 30:15.088
We will send a car over.

30:15.090 --> 30:16.790
Can you give me
the most convenient address?

30:16.792 --> 30:18.626
- What is she saying?
- Secretary would like

30:18.628 --> 30:19.727
to meet with me immediately

30:19.729 --> 30:20.763
and they're going
to send a car?

30:23.164 --> 30:25.833
Mr. Lou's Deli in Brooklyn.

30:25.835 --> 30:28.268
- I'm sure you can find it.
- <i>I will google it.</i>

30:28.270 --> 30:30.303
Mr. Lou's in Brooklyn.
Stay right there.

30:30.305 --> 30:31.371
<i>Okay.</i>

30:31.373 --> 30:33.540
Uh, I'll see you soon.

30:33.542 --> 30:35.811
Oh,
I feel so scared.

30:36.612 --> 30:37.745
Do I look okay?

30:37.747 --> 30:39.212
Do I look funny?

30:39.214 --> 30:40.446
- Why are these pockets here?
- It's okay.

30:40.448 --> 30:41.715
God fucking damn it!

30:41.717 --> 30:43.584
Why am I wearing
these fucking stupid pants?

30:43.586 --> 30:44.818
They're too tapered!

30:44.820 --> 30:47.253
Who wears these silly-looking,
fucking tapered cargo pants

30:47.255 --> 30:49.389
and see the fucking
secretary of state?

30:49.391 --> 30:50.891
You can't think like this.
You have to be positive.

30:50.893 --> 30:52.392
- Mr. Flarsky?
- Oh, shit.

30:52.394 --> 30:53.529
Mr. Flarsky.

30:56.131 --> 30:57.230
Wish me luck, man.

30:57.232 --> 30:58.766
Yeah, you don't need luck, man.
She said it was okay.

30:58.768 --> 30:59.833
Luck is for losers.

30:59.835 --> 31:01.835
You've got destiny
on your side.

31:01.837 --> 31:04.638
You're good. Fred.

31:04.640 --> 31:06.174
You buy the body.

31:06.809 --> 31:08.076
That doesn't mean anything.

31:10.513 --> 31:12.178
Fred, put your
seat belt on.

31:12.180 --> 31:14.650
Take care of my friend.
All right?

31:15.718 --> 31:17.918
- I look normal?
- You look cool.

31:17.920 --> 31:19.321
I love you, Fred!

31:19.889 --> 31:21.757
Nut boys for life!

31:37.840 --> 31:40.808
Empty your pockets
and take off your backpack.

31:40.810 --> 31:42.177
Empty my pockets?

31:44.313 --> 31:45.715
All right. That's...

31:46.816 --> 31:48.250
Let's see how this goes.

31:51.354 --> 31:53.387
Not a regular cop, I assume.

31:53.389 --> 31:56.757
Got bigger fish to fry than
just normal cop shit, right?

31:56.759 --> 31:58.794
So, uh, okay. Let's do it.

32:00.563 --> 32:04.298
That's prescription.
For anxiety. Uh...

32:04.300 --> 32:07.868
This is if you can't dance for
a long time and you want to.

32:07.870 --> 32:10.537
That's prescription as well,
for, uh, lack of energy.

32:10.539 --> 32:11.805
That's energy powder.

32:11.807 --> 32:15.411
These are to wrap
the anxiety medication in

32:16.278 --> 32:19.346
when inhaling it medicinally.

32:19.348 --> 32:21.815
That's if you want to vaporize
the anxiety medicine,

32:21.817 --> 32:23.486
which I have
a prescription for.

32:24.487 --> 32:25.821
And that's a blunt.

32:31.861 --> 32:33.195
Ooh.

32:34.864 --> 32:35.865
Hi.

32:41.604 --> 32:42.672
Wow.

32:44.840 --> 32:46.306
Will you sign this, please?

32:46.308 --> 32:48.509
- What is it?
- It's an NDA.

32:48.511 --> 32:49.576
A non-disclosure agreement?

32:49.578 --> 32:51.880
- That's right.
- Okay.

32:51.882 --> 32:53.547
- Oh, my God.
- Fred.

32:53.549 --> 32:55.349
- Yeah.
- Hey, nice to see you again.

32:55.351 --> 32:56.684
- Hi, you too.
- Come on in.

32:56.686 --> 32:57.685
Take a seat.

32:57.687 --> 32:59.888
Good to see you were
not injured from that fall.

32:59.890 --> 33:01.722
Oh, yeah, you know what?

33:01.724 --> 33:03.323
I actually think
the brim of my hat

33:03.325 --> 33:04.893
kind of protected
my face ultimately.

33:04.895 --> 33:07.294
So, thank God I was
underdressed in the end, right?

33:07.296 --> 33:09.263
Well, as long as you're good.

33:09.265 --> 33:10.664
- I'm okay.
- Yeah. Great.

33:10.666 --> 33:11.734
Uh...

33:13.536 --> 33:14.969
Why am I here?

33:14.971 --> 33:16.570
What I'm about to
share with you

33:16.572 --> 33:18.706
is, obviously,
highly confidential.

33:18.708 --> 33:19.808
Oh, yeah.

33:19.810 --> 33:21.243
Keep it
on the down low.

33:22.746 --> 33:25.414
President Chambers will not
be seeking reelection.

33:25.716 --> 33:26.781
Really?

33:26.783 --> 33:28.449
Yes.

33:28.451 --> 33:32.453
That's fucking sick!
That's awesome.

33:32.455 --> 33:35.556
Are you telling each American
individually the good news?

33:35.558 --> 33:36.623
I mean, but seriously.

33:36.625 --> 33:37.792
Did he just realize
he sucks at it

33:37.794 --> 33:39.526
and decide
not to do it anymore?

33:39.528 --> 33:43.464
He just wants to move
into film and make movies.

33:43.466 --> 33:44.933
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:44.935 --> 33:46.835
That's cool. That's a tough
transition to make.

33:46.837 --> 33:49.671
Not many actors have made
the leap from TV to film.

33:49.673 --> 33:51.405
You got George Clooney,
you got Woody Harrelson...

33:51.407 --> 33:52.473
Jennifer Aniston.

33:52.475 --> 33:54.075
Mmm, did she though?

33:54.077 --> 33:55.777
You don't think Jennifer
Aniston's a movie star?

33:55.779 --> 33:56.845
Just 'cause
you star in movies

33:56.847 --> 33:57.912
doesn't mean
you're a movie star.

33:57.914 --> 34:00.048
The point is...

34:00.050 --> 34:02.853
He's going to endorse me
for president in 2020.

34:03.352 --> 34:04.418
Wow.

34:04.420 --> 34:05.754
- I know.
- <i>Mazel tov.</i>

34:05.756 --> 34:06.888
So.

34:06.890 --> 34:08.956
We're headed to
an environmental summit

34:08.958 --> 34:10.389
hosted by King Gustav

34:10.391 --> 34:12.025
and the Swedish Royal Family.

34:12.027 --> 34:14.328
At the summit,
I'll be announcing

34:14.330 --> 34:16.429
that the world's
three largest polluters

34:16.431 --> 34:17.799
have signed on
to the most comprehensive

34:17.801 --> 34:19.801
and exciting
environmental deal ever.

34:19.803 --> 34:21.069
You know,
after I have some dairy,

34:21.071 --> 34:22.937
I'm one of the world's
three largest polluters.

34:22.938 --> 34:24.105
Excuse me?

34:24.107 --> 34:26.507
We'll address
rising sea levels,

34:26.510 --> 34:28.109
combat deforestation

34:28.110 --> 34:30.445
and protect
the world's pollinators.

34:30.447 --> 34:33.547
I'm calling it the Global
Rehabilitation Initiative.

34:33.550 --> 34:34.815
Internally,
we're referring to it

34:34.818 --> 34:36.117
as "Bees, Trees and the Seas."

34:36.119 --> 34:37.652
Soon after that,

34:37.654 --> 34:39.987
I hope to announce that
100 countries have signed on.

34:39.989 --> 34:42.489
- Wow.
- At which point...

34:42.492 --> 34:44.859
I will resign
as secretary of state.

34:44.860 --> 34:47.862
Using this initiative
as a springboard,

34:47.864 --> 34:50.063
I will announce
my presidential run in 2020.

34:50.065 --> 34:51.668
- Cool.
- So...

34:53.570 --> 34:56.137
I need some writers
to punch up my speeches.

34:56.139 --> 34:58.473
I read your work
and I really like it.

34:58.475 --> 34:59.674
That's... Wow.

34:59.676 --> 35:01.376
You mentioned
you were between jobs.

35:01.378 --> 35:02.343
So it's a really good fit.

35:02.345 --> 35:04.913
It's so nice of you
to think of me at all,

35:04.915 --> 35:07.415
honestly, with everything
going on in your head.

35:07.417 --> 35:08.716
I look forward
to working with you.

35:08.718 --> 35:09.719
Thank you.

35:11.855 --> 35:14.724
Um... So, uh,
when do you need to know by?

35:15.992 --> 35:18.126
What?
I don't understand.

35:18.128 --> 35:20.162
When do you need to know if
I'm going to take your, uh,

35:20.164 --> 35:21.731
your punch-up job?

35:23.134 --> 35:24.599
Right now.

35:24.601 --> 35:27.169
Oh. Uh...
Then I guess,

35:27.171 --> 35:29.871
maybe... Maybe, uh, no?

35:29.873 --> 35:32.141
Maybe no, I don't know.
I don't know!

35:32.143 --> 35:33.242
You know what,
Madam Secretary,

35:33.244 --> 35:35.177
he's not interested.
We tried, it didn't work out.

35:35.179 --> 35:37.948
So I can give you
some writing samples...

35:42.953 --> 35:44.953
What don't you know?

35:44.955 --> 35:47.488
This whole Seas, Bees
and Trees thing.

35:47.490 --> 35:49.124
Is it actually
going to do something?

35:49.126 --> 35:50.792
Or is it going to be
one of those things

35:50.794 --> 35:52.827
that maybe only sounds like
it's gonna do something,

35:52.829 --> 35:54.562
but doesn't
actually do something?

35:54.564 --> 35:57.099
I only wanna come work for you

35:57.101 --> 35:58.666
if it's actually
gonna do something.

35:58.668 --> 35:59.969
It will do something.

35:59.971 --> 36:01.836
This is a perfect document.

36:01.838 --> 36:04.139
They all start out that way
and then they get watered down.

36:04.141 --> 36:05.074
Fred.

36:05.076 --> 36:07.542
Not only does this
initiative sound good,

36:07.544 --> 36:08.409
it's going to do good.

36:08.411 --> 36:10.778
It's gonna save
the fucking planet.

36:10.780 --> 36:12.948
Not to mention,
pay your rent.

36:12.950 --> 36:14.216
So, are you in?

36:14.218 --> 36:16.854
Or do you have something
more important to do?

36:17.855 --> 36:19.522
Than save the planet with you?

36:21.225 --> 36:23.859
No, I don't.
I'm in.

36:23.861 --> 36:25.693
Phew!

36:25.695 --> 36:26.964
Let's save the planet.

36:27.631 --> 36:28.596
That was...

36:28.598 --> 36:30.700
What just happened?
She's good.

36:56.260 --> 36:57.228
Uh, hey.

36:59.163 --> 37:01.163
I had some jokes, uh,
I was gonna run by you,

37:01.165 --> 37:02.599
maybe, if you have a second.

37:05.903 --> 37:08.505
What are you...
What are you looking at?

37:12.910 --> 37:13.976
- Jesus!
- Oh, my God!

37:13.978 --> 37:16.211
Why would you just barge
in here while I'm sleeping?

37:16.213 --> 37:17.746
- You were sleeping?
- Yes!

37:17.748 --> 37:19.514
I was micro napping.

37:19.516 --> 37:21.283
- That's what you call that?
- Yes.

37:21.285 --> 37:22.952
Sorry, I didn't realize
you were sleeping.

37:22.954 --> 37:24.520
You were standing
and your eyes were open.

37:24.522 --> 37:25.587
Do you need something?

37:25.589 --> 37:26.689
I have some jokes
that I wrote

37:26.691 --> 37:28.691
that I was gonna run by you
if you have a second.

37:28.693 --> 37:30.159
Yeah, that was actually
a really good nap.

37:30.161 --> 37:32.194
Great. Seemed very restful.

37:32.196 --> 37:33.197
Okay.

37:36.100 --> 37:37.032
Whoa.

37:37.034 --> 37:40.636
I feel like these jokes
are a little angry.

37:40.638 --> 37:42.938
Oh. I thought maybe
they were, like, emphatic?

37:42.940 --> 37:44.840
"With every
fracking drill thrust,

37:44.842 --> 37:47.676
"we are literally
butt-fucking Mother Earth"?

37:47.678 --> 37:48.844
It can be normal fucking.

37:48.846 --> 37:50.212
It doesn't have to be
in the butt.

37:50.214 --> 37:51.280
I can take that part out.

37:51.282 --> 37:52.848
Yeah, listen, Fred.

37:52.850 --> 37:54.249
If I'm angry,
I'm hysterical.

37:54.251 --> 37:55.851
If I'm emotional,
I'm weak.

37:55.853 --> 37:57.586
If I so much as
raise my voice, I'm a bitch.

37:57.588 --> 37:58.854
My job's hard.

37:58.856 --> 38:00.823
Not as hard as mine.

38:00.825 --> 38:02.624
I think maybe, like,
part of the problem

38:02.626 --> 38:04.893
is that, like, a lot of humor
is based on,

38:04.895 --> 38:07.029
like, personal experiences.

38:07.031 --> 38:07.930
I was thinking, you know,

38:07.932 --> 38:09.898
you cared a lot
about the environment

38:09.900 --> 38:11.066
- since high school.
- Mmm-hmm.

38:11.068 --> 38:14.803
So maybe include
some stories about that.

38:14.805 --> 38:16.173
- High school?
- Yeah.

38:17.742 --> 38:19.008
You think that's funny?

38:19.010 --> 38:20.109
I think it's a good area.

38:20.111 --> 38:22.177
Nostalgia,
pop culture references.

38:22.179 --> 38:23.279
People love that.

38:23.281 --> 38:25.114
Jimmy Fallon's made
an entire career off of that.

38:25.116 --> 38:27.283
When I think about school,
I just think about studying.

38:27.285 --> 38:28.884
No, you did
so much more than that.

38:28.886 --> 38:31.587
I think your whole 1991
platform was pretty on-point

38:31.589 --> 38:32.921
when you were running
for Student Council.

38:32.923 --> 38:35.758
I remember you said,
"Everyone at this school

38:35.760 --> 38:37.960
"pretends to care
about the underdog,

38:37.962 --> 38:39.129
"but the planet Earth is

38:39.131 --> 38:40.330
"the biggest underdog
of them all."

38:40.332 --> 38:41.630
Something like that.

38:41.632 --> 38:42.731
I said that?

38:42.733 --> 38:44.134
Yeah, you did say that.

38:44.136 --> 38:46.035
You were in the kitchen,
making pizza.

38:46.037 --> 38:48.837
We were making signs
for your election.

38:48.839 --> 38:51.074
And you were
wearing that shirt.

38:51.076 --> 38:53.042
I don't know if it was
a strawberry or a flower,

38:53.044 --> 38:54.279
it always confused me.

38:54.812 --> 38:55.878
It was both.

38:55.880 --> 38:57.813
Oh, there you go.

38:57.815 --> 38:59.648
That's all I remember
about that night, though.

38:59.650 --> 39:01.184
Uh, that's where my memories

39:01.186 --> 39:04.686
concerning that evening
expire.

39:04.688 --> 39:07.157
I learned a lot
from that election.

39:07.159 --> 39:08.724
Yeah, that kids are
probably more likely

39:08.726 --> 39:10.126
to vote for two proms

39:10.128 --> 39:12.628
than a very elaborate
recycling program.

39:12.630 --> 39:14.230
Not only kids.

39:14.232 --> 39:17.167
Yeah, that's true.

39:17.169 --> 39:21.004
Did you know he asked me out
to one of those proms?

39:21.006 --> 39:22.172
- Bill Sterling?
- Yeah.

39:22.174 --> 39:23.339
After he beat you?

39:23.341 --> 39:25.676
- Yup.
- Prom one or prom two?

39:27.012 --> 39:28.011
Oh!

39:28.013 --> 39:30.846
What a fuckhead!
You're way better than prom two.

39:31.950 --> 39:34.650
I went to zero proms,
by the way, for the record.

39:34.652 --> 39:36.752
I think you're the smart one
in this situation.

39:36.754 --> 39:38.855
Yes, that's why
I didn't go to prom.

39:38.857 --> 39:42.094
'Cause I was too smart. Uh...

39:44.229 --> 39:47.163
Cool. I'll get to work on
that speech stuff.

39:47.165 --> 39:48.166
Great.

39:48.699 --> 39:49.765
Hey, Fred.

39:49.767 --> 39:51.733
Yeah.

39:51.735 --> 39:54.037
You know, if you want to try
some non-joke stuff,

39:54.039 --> 39:54.971
just go ahead.

39:54.973 --> 39:57.974
Really? Like the main part
of the speech?

39:57.976 --> 40:00.011
Yeah. Just write.

40:01.213 --> 40:02.881
Cool. Awesome. Thanks.

40:03.448 --> 40:04.613
If you take another nap,

40:04.615 --> 40:07.016
you should put on, like,
a bicycle helmet or something.

40:07.018 --> 40:08.918
'Cause you're gonna tip over,
there's turbulence.

40:08.920 --> 40:10.687
That's actually
a really good idea.

40:10.689 --> 40:11.821
It is. I want you
to be careful.

40:11.823 --> 40:12.956
- Yeah.
- We need you.

40:29.307 --> 40:30.874
- Ambassador.
- Welcome to Sweden.

40:30.876 --> 40:32.175
Nice to see you again.

40:32.177 --> 40:33.178
Yeah, you too.

40:35.313 --> 40:36.880
I look forward to seeing you
tonight at dinner.

40:36.882 --> 40:37.981
Yes.

40:37.983 --> 40:39.349
Uh, Madam Secretary,

40:39.351 --> 40:40.717
I have some ideas
I wanna throw by you.

40:40.719 --> 40:41.918
Yeah, soon, Fred.

40:41.920 --> 40:43.153
Tom, do you have the schedule?

40:43.155 --> 40:44.856
- Yes, of course, ma'am.
- All right.

40:47.926 --> 40:49.127
In the back, Flarsky!

40:50.795 --> 40:52.195
Then at 8:15, you have
a fitting for tonight's gala.

40:52.197 --> 40:55.131
Then at 8:45, a call with
Iraqi Prime Minister Masum,

40:55.133 --> 40:57.200
9:15, a call
to Brazilian President Temer

40:57.202 --> 40:58.368
about deforestation issues.

40:58.370 --> 41:01.771
2:15, you have a call with
U.K. Foreign Secretary Green

41:01.773 --> 41:03.973
to discuss your tour
of Scotland in a few weeks.

41:03.975 --> 41:06.142
2:25, then you have
a call with <i>New York Times</i>

41:06.144 --> 41:08.378
to comment on POTUS'
latest Instagram attack

41:08.380 --> 41:10.747
on Prime Minister Bharath
of Kashtar.

41:10.749 --> 41:11.814
At 5:45,
we're meeting with the head

41:11.816 --> 41:12.882
of Sweden's
Diplomatic Protocol,

41:12.884 --> 41:15.818
Ingrid Minervudottir,
to discuss tonight's schedule.

41:15.820 --> 41:17.120
Okay. And then after that?

41:17.122 --> 41:18.422
Also, Parker Wembley
keeps trying to get

41:18.424 --> 41:19.923
- some face time with you.
- Oh, God.

41:19.925 --> 41:22.158
Parker can wait.
Okay, Fred. Go.

41:22.160 --> 41:23.462
Yeah, sure. Um...

41:24.129 --> 41:26.262
So, uh, you know,

41:26.264 --> 41:28.097
based on what we were
talking about last night,

41:28.099 --> 41:30.967
I just took a stab at
the whole speech, basically.

41:30.969 --> 41:32.902
That's good.

41:32.904 --> 41:35.472
- Thank you.
- This part isn't.

41:35.474 --> 41:38.041
Okay, well, you said you
didn't want to sound too angry.

41:38.043 --> 41:40.477
I also don't want to sound
like I have a head injury.

41:40.479 --> 41:42.178
Okay. Uh,
I'll go change it.

41:42.180 --> 41:43.547
Great. Thanks.

41:43.549 --> 41:45.782
Okay, here we go.

41:45.784 --> 41:47.183
So...

41:47.185 --> 41:48.787
All right.

41:49.854 --> 41:50.954
Fred.

41:50.956 --> 41:52.389
Yeah?

41:52.391 --> 41:54.926
Do you have any grown-up
clothes to wear tonight?

41:59.030 --> 42:00.029
I was gonna...
I was thinking

42:00.031 --> 42:02.299
of zipping this up
all the way, like to here.

42:02.301 --> 42:03.234
That's kind of
a little more...

42:03.236 --> 42:04.867
It's, like,
slightly more buttoned up.

42:04.869 --> 42:05.902
You know what,
Madam Secretary,

42:05.904 --> 42:09.939
I would be delighted
to dress Fred for tonight.

42:09.941 --> 42:11.208
Thank you, Maggie.
I'd be thrilled

42:11.210 --> 42:13.444
to have you dress me
for tonight's event.

42:13.446 --> 42:14.545
What a fun adventure.

42:14.547 --> 42:16.879
Get a little makeover.
All right, have a good one.

42:16.881 --> 42:18.082
Thank you, Fred.

42:18.084 --> 42:18.982
Why, thank you.

42:18.984 --> 42:20.284
...and then
it's saying hello,

42:20.286 --> 42:21.418
you'll sit down,
we'll have dinner,

42:21.420 --> 42:22.819
- I'll pull you up...
- Where's Flarsky?

42:22.821 --> 42:23.920
Why are we waiting?

42:23.922 --> 42:25.522
What, is he doing his hair?

42:25.524 --> 42:27.126
Um...

42:27.526 --> 42:29.293
Oh.

42:29.295 --> 42:31.930
What the...

42:36.102 --> 42:37.401
What the fuck
are you wearing?

42:37.403 --> 42:39.436
She bought me
this shit. Okay?

42:39.438 --> 42:41.238
It's a traditional
Swedish suit.

42:41.240 --> 42:44.041
I don't see another
fucking Swede up in here

42:44.043 --> 42:45.342
dressed like this.

42:45.344 --> 42:47.544
It's all I could do
on such short notice.

42:47.546 --> 42:50.214
You just take the jacket off,
it's going to make it better.

42:50.216 --> 42:53.785
It's just... Make it look...
Oh, my God.

42:56.389 --> 42:58.222
Better with
the jacket on? Great.

42:58.224 --> 43:00.224
Razzing the new guy, I get it.
Fuck you, Maggie.

43:00.226 --> 43:01.358
Calm the Smurf down.

43:01.360 --> 43:02.428
Bring a fucking suit
next time.

43:08.434 --> 43:09.500
Do you like the speech?

43:09.502 --> 43:10.668
Yes, the speech is good.

43:10.670 --> 43:13.170
Oh, you're going to have to
stay way back there, Fred.

43:13.172 --> 43:14.938
Just stay back, Flarsky.
Okay? She's got to focus.

43:14.940 --> 43:16.006
On what?

43:16.008 --> 43:17.207
Getting India and China
to agree

43:17.209 --> 43:18.275
to be a part
of this initiative.

43:18.277 --> 43:20.611
They haven't even agreed
to be a part of it yet?

43:20.613 --> 43:23.047
They will, we just have to
sort out a few details.

43:23.049 --> 43:24.148
We just wrote
a whole speech

43:24.150 --> 43:25.316
about how
they're on-board already.

43:25.318 --> 43:26.519
Don't worry, Fred.

43:27.520 --> 43:29.286
You just stay here
and make sure

43:29.288 --> 43:32.489
nobody from <i>Candy Land</i>
needs their car parked, okay?

43:32.491 --> 43:33.891
I don't know
why you needed a writer.

43:33.893 --> 43:35.059
Those are sick burns.

43:36.462 --> 43:38.962
Secretary of State
Charlotte Field

43:38.964 --> 43:41.000
of the United States
of America.

43:43.369 --> 43:45.235
Your Majesty.
Your Highness.

43:45.237 --> 43:46.572
- Your Highness.
- Pleasure.

43:52.545 --> 43:54.013
Oh.

43:56.248 --> 43:58.616
No, thank you.
I'm working right now.

43:58.618 --> 44:00.252
And you know you are, too.

44:01.655 --> 44:02.787
I do know that.

44:02.789 --> 44:05.189
But you dressed me like
Cap'n Crunch's Grindr date,

44:05.191 --> 44:07.492
so I'm going to drink
to make you uncomfortable.

44:07.494 --> 44:10.196
Honestly, Fred, your entire
life makes me uncomfortable.

44:13.099 --> 44:14.532
Oh no, fuck me.

44:17.036 --> 44:18.670
Yes.

44:18.672 --> 44:22.272
We both shop in the same
mystical village, I see.

44:22.274 --> 44:24.676
Yes, you look great.

44:24.678 --> 44:26.043
- Congratulations.
- <i>Skal.</i>

44:26.045 --> 44:27.612
<i>Skal. Skal</i> to you, too.

44:27.614 --> 44:30.517
Yes.

44:32.619 --> 44:33.620
Jesus.

44:36.222 --> 44:39.223
Hey, we're making
a few revisions to the speech.

44:39.225 --> 44:40.224
What?

44:40.226 --> 44:42.394
So we're losing the "Seas" part,
so go cut that,

44:42.396 --> 44:44.362
and then brainstorm
a couple of other funny lines

44:44.364 --> 44:45.463
for the "Trees" section, okay?

44:45.465 --> 44:46.698
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

44:46.700 --> 44:49.367
Losing the Seas part, why?

44:49.369 --> 44:50.769
Because India wouldn't go
for it. So we had to pivot.

44:50.771 --> 44:53.538
That's not a pivot,
that's a third of the whole fucking shit.

44:53.540 --> 44:56.006
Are you kidding me?
That's it, it's just gone?

44:56.008 --> 44:57.107
Yeah, it's gone.

44:57.109 --> 44:58.075
And there's nothing
we can do?

44:58.077 --> 44:59.176
No. And you don't
have to worry about it.

44:59.178 --> 45:03.214
Just go over to the computer.
Start typey-typing.

45:03.216 --> 45:04.217
Well, no.

45:05.218 --> 45:06.718
I'm not gonna do that.

45:06.720 --> 45:08.620
So you quit,
resignation accepted.

45:08.622 --> 45:10.188
I will rewrite the speech.

45:10.190 --> 45:11.289
Oh, the fuck you will!

45:11.291 --> 45:12.392
What the fuck?

45:22.202 --> 45:23.637
- You don't...
- Let go!

45:31.711 --> 45:32.811
Look out. Excuse me!

45:32.813 --> 45:34.512
Stop running!
Stop running! Stop running!

45:34.514 --> 45:35.613
Fred, stop running!

45:38.285 --> 45:39.286
Fred...

45:44.357 --> 45:45.423
Why did you do that?

45:45.425 --> 45:47.358
Because I will not
have you damage

45:47.360 --> 45:48.693
the integrity of my writing!

45:48.695 --> 45:50.695
The integrity of your writing?

45:50.697 --> 45:53.231
You're a punch-up writer,
you're not Maya Angelou!

45:53.233 --> 45:54.732
What is going on?

45:54.734 --> 45:56.434
What's going on
with you, bruh?

45:56.436 --> 45:57.469
Did you just
call me "bruh"?

45:57.471 --> 46:00.238
- She's the secretary of state.
- Is he high?

46:00.240 --> 46:02.440
He is wasted,
but he's also just stupid.

46:02.442 --> 46:04.110
Meet me in the conference
room, I'll handle this.

46:06.813 --> 46:08.346
What's the deal, Fred?

46:08.348 --> 46:11.149
What's the deal?
What's the deal? What are...

46:11.151 --> 46:13.117
The only reason I'm here
is 'cause you told me

46:13.119 --> 46:14.419
you cared about this shit,

46:14.421 --> 46:16.688
and in the time I come
out here to have a smoke,

46:16.690 --> 46:19.524
you fucking got rid of a massive
element of the whole thing.

46:19.526 --> 46:22.828
I got two out of three.
I only lost one.

46:22.830 --> 46:26.064
That one was the seas.

46:26.066 --> 46:28.500
It covers 75% of the planet!

46:28.502 --> 46:30.435
- It's a pretty big one!
- Bring down your voice.

46:30.437 --> 46:31.536
You know why I'm upset?

46:31.538 --> 46:33.638
This is exactly what I thought
was going to happen.

46:33.640 --> 46:35.774
And I even said it.
I said it in your office.

46:35.776 --> 46:38.543
I don't want to write
for some bullshit politician.

46:38.545 --> 46:39.812
I wanted to write for you.

46:39.814 --> 46:41.546
Because I thought you cared
about this shit.

46:41.548 --> 46:44.349
Until you're running the game,
you have to play the game.

46:44.351 --> 46:46.284
Well, then, by the time
you win the game,

46:46.286 --> 46:49.420
you don't know who's scoring
touchdowns on whose nets,

46:49.422 --> 46:51.289
and you don't know
who's hitting home runs

46:51.291 --> 46:52.758
in whose fucking end zones!

46:52.760 --> 46:54.325
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know sports.

46:54.327 --> 46:55.560
Let me try it with food.

46:55.562 --> 46:57.830
You wanna open a restaurant.
But all you got is chopsticks.

46:57.832 --> 47:00.532
No! I don't have time
for this, okay?

47:00.534 --> 47:03.234
If you want to quit,
then just fucking quit.

47:03.236 --> 47:05.103
- I don't give a shit.
- Yeah, you don't give a shit.

47:05.105 --> 47:06.137
- No, I don't.
- You used to fucking give a shit,

47:06.139 --> 47:08.373
but now you don't
give a shit about anything.

47:08.375 --> 47:10.108
You cared more about
recycling in high school

47:10.110 --> 47:12.212
than you do this shit and it's
very disappointing to me.

47:13.413 --> 47:15.714
Fuck this.
I've got a speech to give.

47:15.716 --> 47:16.882
Oh, yeah, good luck
giving it,

47:16.884 --> 47:18.216
it's on my computer
in the snow.

47:18.218 --> 47:19.718
I have copies, you idiot.

47:19.720 --> 47:22.088
You just threw your computer
in the snow, that's it.

47:23.189 --> 47:25.458
Oh, no! Shit!

47:26.627 --> 47:28.694
Oh, God damn it!

47:28.696 --> 47:31.429
It's soaked!
I need a bowl of rice!

47:31.431 --> 47:33.166
I need a big bowl of rice!

47:34.502 --> 47:37.736
God damn it! Why didn't I
back this thing up?

47:37.738 --> 47:39.306
All my shit's on here.

47:49.650 --> 47:51.151
Fred. Look.

47:54.855 --> 47:56.057
Wow.

47:59.927 --> 48:02.095
I've never seen
anything like that.

48:04.465 --> 48:05.466
No, I...

48:06.400 --> 48:08.436
I've seen pictures of it,
but I never...

48:09.637 --> 48:10.638
...actually...

48:12.573 --> 48:14.675
I never saw it.

48:15.643 --> 48:17.278
Are you crying right now?

48:18.211 --> 48:19.212
It's pretty.

48:23.718 --> 48:24.719
Yeah.

48:27.288 --> 48:28.289
Fred?

48:28.723 --> 48:29.724
Yeah?

48:31.225 --> 48:33.459
If you ever pull
some shit like that again,

48:33.461 --> 48:34.795
I'll have you thrown in Gitmo.

48:37.298 --> 48:39.166
Yes, Madam Secretary.
I'm sorry.

48:40.901 --> 48:43.404
You better hope this fucking
speech goes over well.

48:46.207 --> 48:50.409
I've often gravitated
toward the underdog.

48:50.411 --> 48:54.847
The band of misfits who fight
back against the bullies.

48:54.849 --> 48:57.718
In high school, I would talk
about the underdog a lot.

48:59.453 --> 49:02.254
And I would often find myself
on a soapbox,

49:02.256 --> 49:05.660
rambling on and on about
the injustices of the world.

49:08.729 --> 49:11.296
Which makes you
extremely popular,

49:11.298 --> 49:13.799
especially when everybody
would rather be watching

49:13.801 --> 49:15.868
<i>Beverly Hills, 90210.</i>

49:19.907 --> 49:22.574
But that is why I am happy
to announce

49:22.576 --> 49:25.844
an initiative that would make
my 16-year-old self proud.

49:25.846 --> 49:28.347
<i>In what is now being dubbed
"The Underdog Speech,"</i>

49:28.349 --> 49:30.616
<i>the secretary of state
opened up about her childhood</i>

49:30.618 --> 49:31.918
<i>and passion
for the environment</i>

49:31.920 --> 49:34.520
<i>by announcing
a bold new initiative...</i>

49:34.522 --> 49:37.623
<i>...turns out she has always
been an Andrea Zuckerman</i>

49:37.625 --> 49:39.794
<i>in the body of a Kelly Taylor.</i>

49:41.662 --> 49:43.464
- Hey.
- Hi.

49:44.632 --> 49:46.331
Oh, wow, you shaved your neck.

49:46.333 --> 49:47.599
I did. I cleaned it up.

49:47.601 --> 49:49.803
Got my whole back.
Went all the way down.

49:49.805 --> 49:50.970
Looks good.

49:50.972 --> 49:52.806
Trying to make a good
impression, I guess, anyway...

49:52.808 --> 49:54.874
I, uh...

49:54.876 --> 49:58.377
I just wanted to apologize
to you, again,

49:58.379 --> 50:01.714
for acting a little crazy,
you know.

50:01.716 --> 50:03.382
I'm gonna...

50:03.384 --> 50:04.616
I'm going to really try
to tone it down

50:04.618 --> 50:08.289
and not, you know, make you
risk global, uh, humiliation.

50:08.656 --> 50:09.758
Good. Great.

50:10.391 --> 50:11.523
Also.

50:11.525 --> 50:13.059
I googled speech writing

50:13.061 --> 50:14.861
and it was
actually very informative.

50:14.863 --> 50:15.829
What I learned

50:15.831 --> 50:17.130
was that in order to write
better for you,

50:17.132 --> 50:20.566
I should kinda get to know you
better and get in your head,

50:20.568 --> 50:21.701
and everything
I already know about you,

50:21.703 --> 50:22.902
I kinda used
on the first speech.

50:22.904 --> 50:24.369
So, what I did

50:24.371 --> 50:25.772
was I wrote a ton of questions

50:25.774 --> 50:27.539
that will maybe help me
capture your voice,

50:27.541 --> 50:28.842
if you have a minute.

50:28.844 --> 50:30.710
I actually have seven.

50:30.712 --> 50:32.879
Seven. Okay, great.
Yeah. I'll take it.

50:32.881 --> 50:34.379
- All right.
- Seven minutes in heaven.

50:34.381 --> 50:35.715
Um...

50:35.717 --> 50:37.684
- Okay.
- So. Ah... I guess...

50:37.686 --> 50:38.852
Just like...
What are you into?

50:38.854 --> 50:40.053
What kind of shit you into?

50:40.055 --> 50:41.921
Well, this is
pretty much it.

50:41.923 --> 50:43.723
I mean,
secretary of state stuff.

50:43.725 --> 50:46.025
Do you have any hobbies?
Anything? Do you watch TV?

50:46.027 --> 50:47.660
Do you watch <i>Game of Thrones</i>
or anything like that?

50:47.662 --> 50:49.361
Oh, I'm fully aware
of what happened

50:49.363 --> 50:50.864
in every season
of <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

50:50.866 --> 50:52.699
Because you watch it?

50:52.701 --> 50:54.834
Because I read synopses
on every episode.

50:54.836 --> 50:56.503
That can't actually work.

50:56.505 --> 50:58.403
I couldn't believe
when Khaleesi's dragon

50:58.405 --> 50:59.775
came back as a White Walker.

51:00.442 --> 51:01.741
Whoa!

51:01.743 --> 51:02.842
- See?
- What about movies?

51:02.844 --> 51:04.110
Do you watch movies?

51:04.112 --> 51:06.378
Synopses of all
the award contenders.

51:06.380 --> 51:07.714
You used to love movies!

51:07.716 --> 51:09.816
You made me watch
<i>Encino Man</i> 30 times.

51:09.818 --> 51:12.452
"Wheeze a little juice!"

51:12.454 --> 51:14.521
You still do the
worst Pauly Shore impression

51:14.523 --> 51:16.356
in the history of mankind.

51:16.358 --> 51:18.792
I can't believe you're
still doing "The Weasel"

51:18.794 --> 51:20.426
and you haven't seen
any of the Marvel Universe.

51:20.428 --> 51:23.365
Those movies are sick.
You're like frozen in time.

51:23.965 --> 51:25.632
I am Encino Man.

51:26.635 --> 51:29.469
All right, what is your
favorite book as a kid?

51:29.471 --> 51:31.504
<i>The Velveteen Rabbit.</i> You?

51:31.506 --> 51:32.839
<i>Fear and Loathing
in Las Vegas.</i>

51:32.841 --> 51:35.008
- Oh, that explains a lot.
- Yeah.

51:36.912 --> 51:39.412
I'm so sorry
for what we've done to you.

51:39.414 --> 51:40.980
Best drug experience?

51:40.982 --> 51:42.916
I could get summoned
at any moment

51:42.918 --> 51:44.417
to deal with
an international crisis,

51:44.419 --> 51:45.752
I can't do that on acid.

51:45.754 --> 51:47.020
What about Molly?

51:47.022 --> 51:48.154
Who's Molly?

51:49.758 --> 51:51.457
<i>Secretary of State
Charlotte Field</i>

51:51.459 --> 51:54.561
<i>continues on her impressive
20-country world tour</i>

51:54.563 --> 51:55.962
<i>to garner more support</i>

51:55.964 --> 51:57.697
<i>for her ambitious
environmental initiative.</i>

51:57.699 --> 51:59.532
<i>And all in a private jet,
no less.</i>

51:59.534 --> 52:01.034
<i>You know what would
save the environment?</i>

52:01.036 --> 52:02.836
<i>Charlotte Field
grounding her ass.</i>

52:02.838 --> 52:04.437
<i>I know where I'd like
to ground her ass.</i>

52:04.439 --> 52:06.773
<i>Oh, I walked
right into that one.</i>

52:06.775 --> 52:08.975
<i>Must Have Been Love</i>
by Roxette.

52:08.977 --> 52:11.511
- Oh! That's just fucking hot.
- Right?

52:11.513 --> 52:12.979
- I got a new one.
- What?

52:12.981 --> 52:14.414
I got to change
my favorite song.

52:14.416 --> 52:16.049
- You have too many.
- I've done it a few times.

52:16.051 --> 52:19.086
<i>Broccoli</i> by DRAM,
featuring Lil Yachty.

52:19.088 --> 52:20.653
All those words

52:20.655 --> 52:22.555
- are the name of a song?
- Yeah.

52:22.557 --> 52:23.556
I don't
really think I have one.

52:23.558 --> 52:25.825
You gotta have one.
Everyone has one.

52:25.827 --> 52:27.794
Well, I don't embarrass
that easily.

52:27.796 --> 52:29.696
Yeah, I hear that.
I don't either, really.

52:29.698 --> 52:31.798
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't!

52:31.800 --> 52:34.734
Oh, my God. Okay.

52:34.736 --> 52:36.973
What's your favorite
sexual position?

52:38.640 --> 52:40.807
I mean, you know, front.

52:40.809 --> 52:42.508
- Normal. Front facing normal.
- Oh, my God.

52:42.510 --> 52:44.078
- What kinda question is that?
- That's all it took.

52:44.080 --> 52:45.045
Look at you.

52:45.047 --> 52:47.147
Well, what's your favorite
sexual position?

52:47.149 --> 52:49.183
- Don't be gross, Fred. Hi.
- Yeah, see?

52:49.185 --> 52:51.386
What's your favorite
sexual position?

52:52.088 --> 52:53.890
It's too complicated
to explain.

52:55.057 --> 52:56.825
- Really?
- I told you mine.

52:57.525 --> 52:59.525
Oh, God, okay.

52:59.527 --> 53:01.996
I just got back
from a trip to New Delhi.

53:01.998 --> 53:03.964
- Yeah?
- I got called into a meeting

53:03.966 --> 53:06.566
with the Joint Chiefs,
and I was a little nervous.

53:06.568 --> 53:08.701
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

53:08.703 --> 53:12.739
And my stomach was a little
weird from all the curry.

53:12.741 --> 53:13.809
Oh, no.

53:14.509 --> 53:15.477
Delhi belly.

53:17.747 --> 53:21.714
Well, we were in a motorcade
and we couldn't stop.

53:21.716 --> 53:23.052
- Oh, no.
- Mmm-hmm.

53:23.853 --> 53:25.119
God...

53:25.121 --> 53:29.123
I ruined a really nice
Dolce & Gabbana bag.

53:29.125 --> 53:31.557
- You puked in it?
- Nope.

53:31.559 --> 53:34.762
Oh, no!
In a moving vehicle?

53:37.599 --> 53:39.833
Do you actually understand
what's happening right now?

53:39.835 --> 53:42.236
Yes, I speak Russian.

53:42.238 --> 53:44.705
The Russian
Samuel L. Jackson guy is dope.

53:44.707 --> 53:47.076
<i>Do svidanya,</i>
motherfuckers!

53:51.580 --> 53:53.914
Oh, my God, they just
shot the pirate guy!

53:53.916 --> 53:55.149
But he's keeping
the team together.

53:55.151 --> 53:56.216
I know.

53:56.218 --> 53:57.618
I don't think
I can handle that.

53:57.620 --> 53:58.686
- Oh, it's okay.
- No,

53:58.688 --> 54:00.821
I really liked him
in the movie.

54:00.823 --> 54:02.089
Don't worry,
just keep watching.

54:02.091 --> 54:04.825
You know,
the Philippines gets a bad rap.

54:04.827 --> 54:06.660
Because it's pretty nice here.

54:06.662 --> 54:09.063
You'd never know civil war
was about to break out.

54:09.065 --> 54:10.531
This is good.

54:10.533 --> 54:11.699
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

54:11.701 --> 54:16.737
Hey. What if we use
this line to start with?

54:16.739 --> 54:18.005
Yeah, "I'm going to
start this speech

54:18.007 --> 54:19.606
"by saying the same thing
I said to my boss

54:19.608 --> 54:22.076
"at Blockbuster Video
when I was 16.

54:22.078 --> 54:23.277
"I quit."

54:23.279 --> 54:25.713
- That's not bad.
- I love that.

54:25.715 --> 54:27.681
This is really fucking good.

54:27.683 --> 54:29.850
Look at you, you get me, Fred.

54:29.852 --> 54:32.052
I totally get you.

54:32.054 --> 54:33.887
<i>♪ All I want for my birthday</i>

54:33.889 --> 54:35.723
<i>♪ Is a big booty ho</i>

54:35.725 --> 54:37.191
<i>♪ All I want
for my birthday... ♪</i>

54:37.193 --> 54:38.926
I couldn't be happier
that out of all the shit

54:38.928 --> 54:40.728
I played you
from the last decade,

54:40.730 --> 54:42.296
that what you've liked
the most is 2 Chainz.

54:42.298 --> 54:44.698
- It's catchy.
- It's awesome.

54:49.306 --> 54:52.174
So, are you, like, dating
the prime minister of Canada?

54:54.677 --> 54:56.210
- No. No.
- No.

54:56.212 --> 54:58.012
I feel like I read...
Did I read that

54:58.014 --> 54:59.980
in some shitty tabloid
that you guys were dating?

54:59.982 --> 55:02.816
- Maybe it's not true.
- No, I'm sure you did. It's...

55:02.818 --> 55:05.652
They like to write about it,
but no. I...

55:05.654 --> 55:08.655
We're not, we... We flirt.

55:08.657 --> 55:10.057
- Yeah. Okay.
- Kind of.

55:10.059 --> 55:12.762
It's weird.
We made out once.

55:13.629 --> 55:14.697
Dope.

55:15.031 --> 55:16.231
You asked.

55:16.233 --> 55:18.299
No, hey! I've hooked up with

55:18.301 --> 55:20.734
my fair share
of world leaders, too.

55:20.736 --> 55:22.805
I 69'd Fidel Castro once.

55:23.739 --> 55:25.007
You thought
his beard was big.

55:25.741 --> 55:26.807
Um...

55:26.809 --> 55:29.843
But how does that work
with you? Do you, like...

55:29.845 --> 55:31.779
Do you, like, date?

55:31.781 --> 55:35.584
Uh... Yeah. I date.

55:36.286 --> 55:38.219
Generally, you know,

55:38.221 --> 55:40.754
with people who have
similar lifestyles to me.

55:40.756 --> 55:42.259
People who travel a lot.

55:44.194 --> 55:47.863
It's hard to keep
those things alive. I...

55:49.199 --> 55:51.632
I mean, who wants to
follow me around the world

55:51.634 --> 55:53.970
and hope I have five minutes
to be affectionate?

55:54.870 --> 55:56.237
- Yeah.
- And honestly,

55:56.239 --> 55:58.006
guys don't really
want to date women

55:58.008 --> 55:59.307
who are more powerful
than them.

55:59.309 --> 56:00.910
They think they do, but...

56:02.179 --> 56:04.012
It's a dick shriveller.

56:04.014 --> 56:06.114
- Uff.
- Mmm-hmm.

56:06.116 --> 56:08.349
Dick Shriveller is my favorite
Batman villain though.

56:08.351 --> 56:10.053
So...

56:11.754 --> 56:13.687
You gonna ask
why I'm still single?

56:13.689 --> 56:16.191
No, I get it.

56:16.193 --> 56:18.295
- It makes sense.
- Yeah. It adds up.

56:28.038 --> 56:29.170
We're right in front
of the window.

56:31.174 --> 56:32.774
What the fuck is happening?

56:32.776 --> 56:34.409
Insurgents are fighting
the army.

56:34.411 --> 56:36.311
- Are we in danger?
- Yes! Yes!

56:36.313 --> 56:37.979
Madam Secretary,
we need to leave now!

56:37.981 --> 56:39.314
Fuck!

56:39.316 --> 56:40.683
This way!

56:42.052 --> 56:44.052
All right, guys, come with me.

56:44.054 --> 56:45.654
Come on.

57:10.013 --> 57:11.146
Secretary Field, this way!

57:11.148 --> 57:13.116
I got her, secure them!

57:14.117 --> 57:15.185
This way.

57:18.722 --> 57:19.890
You'll be safe in here.

57:21.191 --> 57:23.224
Oh, fuck! Are you okay?

57:23.226 --> 57:24.225
Yeah, I'm okay. Are you okay?

57:24.227 --> 57:26.227
I'm okay. Yeah.
We're okay. Okay.

57:26.229 --> 57:30.231
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay. Holy shit!

57:30.233 --> 57:33.468
Oh,
we could have just died.

57:33.470 --> 57:36.271
Oh, my God, I'm freaking out
a bit right now.

57:36.273 --> 57:37.338
I'm having a hard time

57:37.340 --> 57:38.474
catching my breath
a little bit.

57:38.476 --> 57:39.542
You don't seem like you're
freaking out very much.

57:39.544 --> 57:42.877
I am! I'm employing
a Navy SEAL breathing technique,

57:42.879 --> 57:44.145
for dealing with panicking.

57:44.147 --> 57:46.381
It's just gonna take about
90 seconds to work.

57:46.383 --> 57:49.350
90 seconds? I need more than
fucking 90 seconds!

57:49.352 --> 57:51.085
I need 90 fucking years!

57:51.087 --> 57:53.788
I'm fucked up for life
from this shit, yo!

57:53.790 --> 57:56.525
I have so many regrets,
did so many terrible things!

57:56.527 --> 57:59.961
When I was 12, I peed on a dog
to impress an older kid.

57:59.963 --> 58:02.265
The dog didn't like it.
The older kid didn't either!

58:03.133 --> 58:04.199
It was just pointless.

58:04.201 --> 58:05.967
What the fuck?

58:05.969 --> 58:08.038
Holy shit! Fuck!

58:09.139 --> 58:11.340
Is there more? Is there
gonna be more?

58:11.342 --> 58:12.541
- Fred.
- Is there more?

58:12.543 --> 58:13.942
You're gonna
have to calm down.

58:13.944 --> 58:15.176
I don't think I can.

58:15.178 --> 58:16.978
Sit down with me.

58:16.980 --> 58:18.112
And breathe.

58:18.114 --> 58:20.482
Four seconds in.

58:20.484 --> 58:21.550
Four seconds out.

58:21.552 --> 58:23.385
Four seconds in.

58:23.387 --> 58:25.053
One, two, three, four...

58:25.055 --> 58:27.922
- Four seconds out.
- One, two...

58:27.924 --> 58:30.792
- Four seconds in.
- One, two, three, four...

58:30.794 --> 58:32.294
You don't have to count
while you're doing this.

58:32.296 --> 58:33.429
...four. It helps me.

58:33.431 --> 58:37.131
- One, two, three, four...
- There you go.

58:37.133 --> 58:39.468
One, two, three, four.

58:39.470 --> 58:41.372
One, two, three, four.

58:42.240 --> 58:44.040
One, two, three, four.

58:45.243 --> 58:47.278
- You got it.
- That actually works.

58:48.312 --> 58:49.846
Those guys are good.

58:54.418 --> 58:56.118
We did almost just die,
though.

58:56.120 --> 58:57.186
We actually did almost die.

58:57.188 --> 58:58.853
- Yeah.
- Oh, thank God.

58:58.855 --> 58:59.988
That actually
makes me feel better.

58:59.990 --> 59:01.123
Means I didn't overreact.

59:01.125 --> 59:03.860
Oh, God, no, you completely
overreacted.

59:04.928 --> 59:06.097
Yeah, maybe.

59:08.599 --> 59:10.401
I can think of worse ways
to go

59:11.469 --> 59:13.137
than here with you.

59:14.472 --> 59:16.372
Honestly, this has been like,

59:16.374 --> 59:19.176
the best few weeks
of my entire life.

59:22.546 --> 59:23.878
You don't have to say it
back to me.

59:23.880 --> 59:25.147
I know it's not true for you.

59:25.149 --> 59:27.182
I saw you sing with
Bruce Springsteen last year,

59:27.184 --> 59:28.550
at that benefit concert.
That was probably

59:28.552 --> 59:30.019
a way better week.

59:30.021 --> 59:32.854
Just as an example.

59:32.856 --> 59:35.291
Well, this is
a pretty close second.

59:35.293 --> 59:37.393
Really? To The Boss?

59:37.395 --> 59:38.460
Yeah.

59:38.462 --> 59:40.797
Wow. That's nice.

59:47.438 --> 59:48.806
Uh...

59:54.478 --> 59:57.546
I feel like maybe you want me
to kiss you right now,

59:57.548 --> 59:59.515
but I don't want to make
the same stupid mistake

59:59.517 --> 01:00:00.949
I made 25 years ago.

01:00:00.951 --> 01:00:02.820
Wouldn't be a stupid mistake.

01:00:03.521 --> 01:00:05.122
Wait... Really?

01:00:11.662 --> 01:00:13.262
We've secured the location.

01:00:13.264 --> 01:00:16.133
But we need to move you.
The helicopter is standing by.

01:00:17.234 --> 01:00:18.936
Thank you, Agent M.

01:00:23.507 --> 01:00:24.907
Holy shit.

01:00:24.909 --> 01:00:25.974
That helicopter was way louder

01:00:25.976 --> 01:00:27.376
than I thought
it was gonna be.

01:00:27.378 --> 01:00:29.347
- Fred, enough. Enough.
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

01:00:30.214 --> 01:00:31.313
We're safe here though?

01:00:31.315 --> 01:00:32.981
- Yes!
- Oh, my God, Fred!

01:00:32.983 --> 01:00:34.049
This way.

01:00:34.051 --> 01:00:35.286
This place
looks really nice.

01:00:39.223 --> 01:00:40.690
Fred, I need you
to come work

01:00:40.692 --> 01:00:42.524
on that speech with me,
right now.

01:00:42.526 --> 01:00:44.596
- Right now?
- Yeah. Right now.

01:00:45.463 --> 01:00:46.565
Okay.

01:00:52.937 --> 01:00:54.103
Hang on, get my pants off.

01:00:54.105 --> 01:00:55.439
Okay, I gotta, too. Shit.

01:00:56.941 --> 01:00:58.340
- We're doing it?
- Yeah!

01:00:58.342 --> 01:00:59.408
- Do it faster.
- Let's do it.

01:00:59.410 --> 01:01:00.411
They're coming off!

01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:04.382
Fucking tapered pants. Shit!

01:01:05.717 --> 01:01:06.917
Fuck!

01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:10.085
Okay, just leave
it! Just leave it! Leave it!

01:01:10.087 --> 01:01:11.554
- Okay.
- Okay. Yeah.

01:01:11.556 --> 01:01:12.622
Should I go in, then?

01:01:12.624 --> 01:01:14.289
Yeah, enter.

01:01:14.291 --> 01:01:17.560
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, no!

01:01:17.562 --> 01:01:19.696
- I'm gonna come really soon.
- Me too.

01:01:19.698 --> 01:01:21.163
- Really?
- Yeah!

01:01:21.165 --> 01:01:22.231
- Oh, God!
- Oh!

01:01:22.233 --> 01:01:23.633
Oh, boy!

01:01:26.471 --> 01:01:29.406
- Oh, God! Okay.
- Oh, my God!

01:01:29.408 --> 01:01:31.307
- I'm coming out.
- Okay, come on.

01:01:31.309 --> 01:01:37.112
Oh, God. Oh! Oh! Oh, fuck!

01:01:37.114 --> 01:01:40.352
Wow. Oh, my God,
I'm sorry.

01:01:41.253 --> 01:01:42.452
I don't know
what happened.

01:01:42.454 --> 01:01:44.654
I usually last
way longer than that.

01:01:44.656 --> 01:01:46.056
- You know?
- Not me.

01:01:47.091 --> 01:01:48.023
That was weird.

01:01:48.025 --> 01:01:49.225
We both said, "Oh, boy"
when we came...

01:01:49.227 --> 01:01:51.194
- Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
- ...at the same time.

01:01:51.196 --> 01:01:52.729
- That's never happened before.
- I've never said that.

01:01:52.731 --> 01:01:55.998
- Yeah.
- Super strange.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.700
- Oh!
- Should we do that again?

01:01:57.702 --> 01:01:59.369
Yeah, my hands are shaking,
I need a minute.

01:02:04.074 --> 01:02:05.708
Hmm.

01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:08.645
Who's this little guy?

01:02:08.647 --> 01:02:10.547
I was a writing an article
about neo-Nazis

01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:12.282
and I had to get a bottom half

01:02:12.284 --> 01:02:13.716
of a swastika
tattooed on me...

01:02:13.718 --> 01:02:15.552
- Oh, my God.
- ...so they wouldn't kill me

01:02:15.554 --> 01:02:17.554
and I didn't want that,

01:02:17.556 --> 01:02:20.690
so I added little shoes and
I made him a little stick man

01:02:20.692 --> 01:02:24.160
and I named him
Adolf Stickler.

01:02:24.162 --> 01:02:26.229
You'd never know
he had little swastika legs.

01:02:26.231 --> 01:02:27.697
- No.
- He's so happy about it.

01:02:27.699 --> 01:02:28.765
I know, they just
look like pants.

01:02:28.767 --> 01:02:31.401
You'd never know he was born
in the fires of hatred.

01:02:34.806 --> 01:02:36.608
Man, I am hungry.

01:02:39.244 --> 01:02:40.743
What time is it?

01:02:40.745 --> 01:02:43.415
I couldn't tell you
what fucking day it is.

01:02:44.549 --> 01:02:47.517
And where...
Where are we right now?

01:02:47.519 --> 01:02:48.818
I don't have a clue.

01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:50.086
You don't know?

01:02:50.088 --> 01:02:51.287
No. They just
dropped us here.

01:02:51.289 --> 01:02:53.558
They just took us here
on the helicopter.

01:03:15.647 --> 01:03:16.713
Good morning,
Mr. Flarsky.

01:03:16.715 --> 01:03:18.083
Jesus!

01:03:20.151 --> 01:03:21.486
You scared me, man.

01:03:27.225 --> 01:03:29.827
Could you maybe not tell
anybody about this?

01:03:29.829 --> 01:03:31.630
They wouldn't
believe me anyway.

01:03:33.265 --> 01:03:34.332
Fair enough.

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:36.736
Good luck, man.

01:03:38.704 --> 01:03:39.772
Thank you.

01:03:48.781 --> 01:03:51.180
<i>These helicopters are scary.</i>

01:03:51.182 --> 01:03:54.319
<i>It's gonna be fine, Fred.
Just breathe.</i>

01:03:57.322 --> 01:03:59.790
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

01:03:59.792 --> 01:04:01.794
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

01:04:13.906 --> 01:04:15.806
I feel so happy right now!

01:04:15.808 --> 01:04:17.541
Like,
I'm beginning to realize,

01:04:17.543 --> 01:04:19.275
I may have never been happy.

01:04:19.277 --> 01:04:21.779
This might be the first time
I ever felt happy.

01:04:21.781 --> 01:04:23.246
And it feels good.

01:04:23.248 --> 01:04:26.249
This is like, the best shit
that's ever happened.

01:04:26.251 --> 01:04:28.184
There's like this crazy big
banquet thing tonight,

01:04:28.186 --> 01:04:29.787
and she gave me
like a tuxedo to wear.

01:04:29.789 --> 01:04:30.854
And it's not like a date,

01:04:30.856 --> 01:04:32.456
but it kinda
feels like a date.

01:04:32.458 --> 01:04:35.158
<i>How do I not fuck this up?
Seems impossible.</i>

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:37.394
Dude, you just need to give
yourself affirmation, man.

01:04:37.396 --> 01:04:39.195
You need to...

01:04:39.197 --> 01:04:41.266
You need to say that
you're worthy of love, man.

01:04:42.233 --> 01:04:43.534
I am worthy of love.

01:04:43.536 --> 01:04:45.201
<i>All right, now you gotta
say it 10,000</i>

01:04:45.203 --> 01:04:46.704
more times,
until you believe it.

01:04:46.706 --> 01:04:48.171
<i>Okay, look, I gotta go.</i>

01:04:48.173 --> 01:04:50.507
<i>I have no fucking clue
how to tie a bow tie.</i>

01:04:50.509 --> 01:04:52.175
All right, man. Hey!

01:04:52.177 --> 01:04:53.178
<i>Be bold!</i>

01:05:09.595 --> 01:05:10.928
Hi.

01:05:10.930 --> 01:05:13.597
You look really pretty.

01:05:13.599 --> 01:05:14.834
Thank you.

01:05:15.735 --> 01:05:18.802
You look really pretty, too.

01:05:18.804 --> 01:05:19.870
Thank you.

01:05:19.872 --> 01:05:21.305
Thanks for the suit.

01:05:21.307 --> 01:05:22.439
We should probably head in.

01:05:22.441 --> 01:05:23.542
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

01:05:26.979 --> 01:05:29.747
Wow. This is awesome.

01:05:29.749 --> 01:05:31.415
It's cool being
in Argentina.

01:05:31.417 --> 01:05:32.816
I think the guys
who killed my grandparents

01:05:32.818 --> 01:05:34.620
are hiding here somewhere.

01:05:35.354 --> 01:05:36.455
Shit, they got a band.

01:05:38.457 --> 01:05:41.892
Do you wanna, uh, dance maybe?
Or grab a drink?

01:05:41.894 --> 01:05:43.427
So there are representatives

01:05:43.429 --> 01:05:45.295
from over 75 countries
here tonight.

01:05:45.297 --> 01:05:46.830
She has three hours
to get out there,

01:05:46.832 --> 01:05:47.865
- shake her money maker...
- Yeah.

01:05:47.867 --> 01:05:49.600
...and get as many
commitments as possible.

01:05:49.602 --> 01:05:51.268
- This is a work event.
- Of course, yeah. I get it.

01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:54.538
We could, uh, maybe at the end
of the night, have a drink.

01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:56.674
Yeah, if you have time.
Cool.

01:05:56.676 --> 01:05:58.742
- We'll see.
- Yeah.

01:05:58.744 --> 01:06:00.546
All right. Okay.

01:06:04.550 --> 01:06:05.885
I know what's going on.

01:06:09.255 --> 01:06:11.689
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

01:06:11.691 --> 01:06:12.756
There's nothing going on.

01:06:12.758 --> 01:06:14.926
Don't fucking bullshit me,
Fred.

01:06:14.928 --> 01:06:17.628
'Cause my EQ is through
the goddamn roof.

01:06:17.630 --> 01:06:20.698
And I understand and intuit
the nuances of social dynamics

01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:21.665
like you wouldn't believe.

01:06:21.667 --> 01:06:24.601
The two of you are having sex
with each other.

01:06:24.603 --> 01:06:26.437
There's no way you could
discern something like that.

01:06:26.439 --> 01:06:27.673
Charlotte told me.

01:06:28.441 --> 01:06:29.373
Really?

01:06:29.375 --> 01:06:31.442
No, but you just did,
you fucking idiot.

01:06:31.444 --> 01:06:34.445
Fuck! Shit!
That was fucking very clever.

01:06:34.447 --> 01:06:35.612
Jesus, well,
you know what, yes.

01:06:35.614 --> 01:06:37.648
Okay. We're sexing
one another down.

01:06:37.650 --> 01:06:38.549
- So?
- Ew.

01:06:38.551 --> 01:06:39.918
Honestly, it's probably
weirder to me

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:41.052
- than it is to you.
- Look,

01:06:41.054 --> 01:06:42.219
I can't believe
I have to say this,

01:06:42.221 --> 01:06:45.458
but just so you know, there's
no way the two of you work.

01:06:46.659 --> 01:06:48.392
Why would you say that?
You don't know that.

01:06:48.394 --> 01:06:50.461
The public will never accept
the two of you together,

01:06:50.463 --> 01:06:51.830
so neither will she.

01:06:51.832 --> 01:06:53.430
Honestly, Fred,
it doesn't matter

01:06:53.432 --> 01:06:54.398
if you get it or you don't,

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:56.067
'cause the truth is,
she is going to realize it

01:06:56.069 --> 01:06:57.334
for the both of you,

01:06:57.336 --> 01:06:59.436
then you'll have
your heart broken.

01:06:59.438 --> 01:07:00.772
And that could be
kinda fun to watch.

01:07:00.774 --> 01:07:02.475
Ambassador Plenipotentiary...

01:07:19.626 --> 01:07:20.861
Madam Secretary!

01:07:21.962 --> 01:07:23.494
Excuse me.

01:07:23.496 --> 01:07:24.629
- Ah!
- Parker.

01:07:24.631 --> 01:07:26.698
Nope. Nope. Uh...

01:07:28.568 --> 01:07:31.936
You know, we still have not
found time to sit down.

01:07:31.938 --> 01:07:33.104
You know,
it's not gonna happen.

01:07:33.106 --> 01:07:34.739
I'm not gonna find time.

01:07:34.741 --> 01:07:37.341
I will get my way on this.

01:07:37.343 --> 01:07:38.676
I don't even know
what you mean by "this,"

01:07:38.678 --> 01:07:41.112
but please have at it.
It's all yours.

01:07:41.114 --> 01:07:42.547
- May I have a word?
- Can you excuse me?

01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:43.782
We're in the middle
of a conversation here.

01:07:43.784 --> 01:07:46.451
- Of course. Yes.
- Oh, my God. You are a...

01:07:46.453 --> 01:07:48.953
You look
absolutely wonderful.

01:07:48.955 --> 01:07:50.855
Oh.

01:07:52.092 --> 01:07:53.591
I have to say,
I have been

01:07:53.593 --> 01:07:55.827
so impressed
by your initiative.

01:07:55.829 --> 01:07:57.595
Does this mean
I can add Canada

01:07:57.597 --> 01:07:59.597
to the list of countries
taking part?

01:07:59.599 --> 01:08:01.766
On one condition.

01:08:01.768 --> 01:08:02.667
Let me guess.

01:08:02.669 --> 01:08:05.403
You want fewer restrictions
on lumber.

01:08:05.405 --> 01:08:06.740
I don't care about lumber.

01:08:08.041 --> 01:08:09.576
I just want to dance.

01:08:13.013 --> 01:08:14.078
Sure.

01:08:37.737 --> 01:08:38.805
Whoa!

01:08:40.006 --> 01:08:41.508
Wow.

01:08:42.876 --> 01:08:44.108
You know
when you see something,

01:08:44.109 --> 01:08:47.444
and it just looks right.

01:08:47.447 --> 01:08:49.514
Like a Kangol hat
on Samuel L. Jackson.

01:08:49.515 --> 01:08:50.517
Mmm-hmm.

01:09:00.161 --> 01:09:01.862
I'm worthy of love.

01:09:03.563 --> 01:09:04.898
I'm worthy of love.

01:09:07.533 --> 01:09:08.835
What the fuck
are you saying?

01:09:09.736 --> 01:09:10.737
Nothing.

01:09:43.938 --> 01:09:44.939
<i>Bonjour,</i> ma'am.

01:10:17.972 --> 01:10:18.973
Excuse me.

01:10:21.042 --> 01:10:22.575
Agent E, look alive.

01:10:38.159 --> 01:10:39.526
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:10:40.294 --> 01:10:41.929
I hear you have
a crush on me.

01:10:43.297 --> 01:10:44.665
I do.

01:10:46.233 --> 01:10:48.035
Kinda have
a crush on you, too.

01:10:49.737 --> 01:10:50.905
Well, that's cool.

01:10:54.175 --> 01:10:56.275
Hey, I know I asked earlier.

01:10:56.277 --> 01:10:57.843
But, uh...

01:11:01.549 --> 01:11:02.883
Do you want to dance with me?

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:06.721
It's a dope song.

01:11:07.888 --> 01:11:09.121
Really fucking good song.

01:11:09.123 --> 01:11:10.255
Maybe the best song
ever written.

01:11:10.257 --> 01:11:11.258
Yeah.

01:12:59.401 --> 01:13:01.034
I want you to
fuck me from behind

01:13:01.036 --> 01:13:02.204
and slap my ass really hard.

01:13:04.873 --> 01:13:06.072
What?

01:13:06.074 --> 01:13:07.407
What?

01:13:07.409 --> 01:13:09.675
Nothing. What,
did I say "what"?

01:13:09.677 --> 01:13:10.977
Am I being too bossy?

01:13:10.979 --> 01:13:13.745
No. No. No. No. Not at all.
No. No.

01:13:13.747 --> 01:13:15.281
I am. I am.
I'm your boss all day,

01:13:15.283 --> 01:13:16.149
and now I'm bossing you
in bed.

01:13:16.151 --> 01:13:17.683
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it that way.

01:13:17.685 --> 01:13:18.885
No. Not at all.

01:13:18.887 --> 01:13:20.753
My brain, honestly, just went
into shock a little bit...

01:13:20.755 --> 01:13:21.888
Yeah, but you hesitated.

01:13:21.890 --> 01:13:24.924
No, it's just not how
I imagined you liking things.

01:13:24.926 --> 01:13:28.027
You know what? We'll do exactly
what you were imagining.

01:13:28.029 --> 01:13:30.029
And then you turn me around
and slap me on my ass

01:13:30.031 --> 01:13:31.266
and then choke me
a little bit.

01:13:32.033 --> 01:13:33.034
Oh, my God.

01:13:40.775 --> 01:13:41.843
Whoa.

01:13:51.853 --> 01:13:52.854
Frederick.

01:13:53.455 --> 01:13:54.689
Margaret.

01:13:59.461 --> 01:14:01.261
Hey, you forgot this...
Oh, fuck!

01:14:01.263 --> 01:14:03.029
- Gross!
- Um...

01:14:03.031 --> 01:14:04.364
I thought you guys
hated each other.

01:14:04.366 --> 01:14:06.466
- We do hate each other.
- We do. Big time.

01:14:06.468 --> 01:14:08.401
- We are also fucking.
- Ugh.

01:14:08.403 --> 01:14:09.503
How long
have you been fucking?

01:14:09.505 --> 01:14:10.837
That was probably 20 minutes.

01:14:10.839 --> 01:14:11.905
Not right now!

01:14:11.907 --> 01:14:14.107
- Oh.
- A lot of questions. Um, I...

01:14:14.109 --> 01:14:15.275
I would say
anywhere between

01:14:15.277 --> 01:14:17.143
two and five...
Three and a half times.

01:14:17.145 --> 01:14:18.978
I would say on my end, five.

01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:20.447
Three and a half sounds right.

01:14:20.449 --> 01:14:22.815
I don't know how you're tallying that shit.
That's sick.

01:14:22.817 --> 01:14:25.251
Okay, first of all,
there's a woman present.

01:14:25.253 --> 01:14:26.886
There's a woman
in there, too?

01:14:26.888 --> 01:14:28.788
- Excuse me.
- Easy.

01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:29.989
- And I got it.
- Sorry.

01:14:29.991 --> 01:14:31.357
- Again.
- Sorry, I'm...

01:14:31.359 --> 01:14:33.226
A woman is present
and that woman is me.

01:14:33.228 --> 01:14:34.827
- You?
- We're talking about her.

01:14:34.829 --> 01:14:36.763
Trust me, I know, Fred.

01:14:36.765 --> 01:14:37.830
Tom, I got this.

01:14:37.832 --> 01:14:39.265
- Ugh!
- I'm gonna say goodnight.

01:14:39.267 --> 01:14:40.467
You tuck that in.
Goodnight to you.

01:14:40.469 --> 01:14:41.334
And I will take my leave.

01:14:41.336 --> 01:14:44.371
No. No way.
I'm not touching that shit.

01:14:44.373 --> 01:14:46.839
- It's not the worst instinct.
- Guys, just...

01:14:46.841 --> 01:14:47.907
Those hands
have been places.

01:14:47.909 --> 01:14:49.410
Goodnight.

01:14:49.412 --> 01:14:51.911
<i>With France's commitment,
U.S. Secretary of State</i>

01:14:51.913 --> 01:14:55.282
<i>Charlotte Field's noble
Rehabilitation Initiative</i>

01:14:55.284 --> 01:14:57.318
<i>has secured the support
of 100 countries.</i>

01:14:59.422 --> 01:15:00.688
The president
wants to talk to you.

01:15:00.690 --> 01:15:03.823
We've set up the tent in the next
room, Madam Secretary.

01:15:03.825 --> 01:15:05.093
Tell him hi.

01:15:09.532 --> 01:15:12.165
Mr. President. <i>Bonjour.</i>

01:15:12.167 --> 01:15:13.434
<i>Charlie,</i> bonjour.

01:15:13.436 --> 01:15:17.003
<i>Hey, what's this I hear about
an environmental treaty thing?</i>

01:15:17.005 --> 01:15:18.805
Oh, it's the Global

01:15:18.807 --> 01:15:20.907
Rehabilitation Initiative,
sir.

01:15:20.909 --> 01:15:23.410
It's been on your desk for the
last three weeks.

01:15:23.412 --> 01:15:25.512
Yeah, well,
we ran it up the flagpole

01:15:25.514 --> 01:15:27.947
and it's ruffling
some feathers.

01:15:27.949 --> 01:15:30.083
Sir, you are the flagpole.

01:15:30.085 --> 01:15:33.520
There are actually quite a few
flagpoles in this joint.

01:15:33.522 --> 01:15:35.289
<i>We need you to revise it.</i>

01:15:35.291 --> 01:15:36.292
Sir?

01:15:37.193 --> 01:15:39.295
<i>We need you to kill the trees.</i>

01:15:43.299 --> 01:15:44.531
Why would he do that?

01:15:44.533 --> 01:15:47.568
Because he's funded by a
bunch of fucking rich assholes

01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:49.203
and I probably pissed
one of them off.

01:15:49.205 --> 01:15:50.903
Can I just say
the optics of this

01:15:50.905 --> 01:15:52.606
are actually
not that different?

01:15:52.608 --> 01:15:54.408
The initiative still has
the same name.

01:15:54.410 --> 01:15:56.176
It sounds
very impressive,

01:15:56.178 --> 01:15:58.312
which is ultimately
all that matters.

01:15:58.314 --> 01:16:01.015
I actually cared about this.

01:16:01.017 --> 01:16:02.583
Now what am I
fucking left with? Bees?

01:16:02.585 --> 01:16:03.916
I don't even like bees.

01:16:03.918 --> 01:16:05.185
Do you have to
listen to him?

01:16:05.187 --> 01:16:08.355
Yes. I have to listen to him.

01:16:08.357 --> 01:16:11.191
Because unless he endorses me,
I won't win.

01:16:11.193 --> 01:16:14.128
And this whole fucking show
would have been for nothing.

01:16:14.130 --> 01:16:16.196
Well, maybe you don't need
his endorsement to win.

01:16:16.198 --> 01:16:17.564
You know?
People are digging your shit.

01:16:17.566 --> 01:16:19.233
And your numbers are good.

01:16:19.235 --> 01:16:21.435
You know what, Fred?
She needs a little alone time.

01:16:21.437 --> 01:16:22.970
Right, she probably just needs
a friend right now.

01:16:22.972 --> 01:16:24.038
Time to go, buddy.

01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:25.906
Oh, my God.

01:16:25.908 --> 01:16:29.145
Maggie, just give me a second
alone with Fred, please.

01:16:43.993 --> 01:16:46.393
I don't wanna
do this job anymore.

01:16:46.395 --> 01:16:47.463
I fuckin' hate it.

01:16:48.364 --> 01:16:50.531
I mean, what's the point?

01:16:50.533 --> 01:16:53.836
Every time I do something,
it just gets undone.

01:16:54.403 --> 01:16:55.636
I'm sorry.

01:16:55.638 --> 01:16:57.438
I just wanna be
a normal person

01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:59.206
and not give a fuck
about anything

01:16:59.208 --> 01:17:01.241
just like
the rest of the world.

01:17:01.243 --> 01:17:03.310
Yeah, most people don't
give a shit about anything.

01:17:03.312 --> 01:17:05.014
I bet it's really nice.

01:17:06.182 --> 01:17:08.015
That's what I want.

01:17:08.017 --> 01:17:10.119
I don't know
how to give that to you.

01:17:13.556 --> 01:17:15.124
Let's get fucked up.

01:17:15.524 --> 01:17:16.591
Fucked up?

01:17:16.593 --> 01:17:19.059
- Yeah.
- Like a few beers fucked up

01:17:19.061 --> 01:17:21.328
or more than that fucked up?

01:17:21.330 --> 01:17:23.299
Like super fucked up.

01:17:29.138 --> 01:17:31.606
I want to smoke
a Molly with you.

01:17:33.042 --> 01:17:34.210
What?

01:17:34.977 --> 01:17:36.711
That's not, um...

01:17:36.713 --> 01:17:38.379
That's not
how you take it, but...

01:17:38.381 --> 01:17:39.279
How do you take it?

01:17:39.281 --> 01:17:41.148
It's a pill.
You take it in your mouth.

01:17:41.150 --> 01:17:42.684
But I don't know
if you wanna do it.

01:17:42.686 --> 01:17:44.017
Why not?

01:17:44.019 --> 01:17:45.953
I just don't know
if it's a good idea.

01:17:45.955 --> 01:17:49.325
As your boss, I'm ordering you
to get me a Molly.

01:17:50.259 --> 01:17:51.428
Oh, man.

01:18:21.458 --> 01:18:22.624
You good?

01:18:22.626 --> 01:18:24.592
I don't feel anything.

01:18:24.594 --> 01:18:26.594
You don't feel it?

01:18:26.596 --> 01:18:28.396
No, I don't feel
a fucking thing.

01:18:28.398 --> 01:18:31.201
Ooh! Wow.

01:18:31.668 --> 01:18:34.202
...Was right.

01:18:34.204 --> 01:18:38.105
Holy fuck...

01:18:38.107 --> 01:18:39.441
No!

01:18:39.443 --> 01:18:41.776
My jaw feels
really weird.

01:18:41.778 --> 01:18:43.110
Yeah, that's the drugs.

01:18:43.112 --> 01:18:44.712
Drugs love a jaw.

01:18:44.714 --> 01:18:47.148
- I want more.
- No, no, no, no.

01:18:47.150 --> 01:18:48.550
Maybe in like an hour.

01:18:48.552 --> 01:18:50.253
We should do it now.

01:19:19.115 --> 01:19:21.316
Yes, motherfuckers!

01:19:21.318 --> 01:19:23.251
I could do this forever!

01:19:23.253 --> 01:19:24.652
We're gonna.

01:19:24.654 --> 01:19:27.155
I know I've been like...

01:19:27.157 --> 01:19:29.390
I've been, like, playing it
pretty cool.

01:19:29.392 --> 01:19:31.392
Like I've probably been
a little hard to read,

01:19:31.394 --> 01:19:33.061
and I've been acting
kinda, like, aloof,

01:19:33.063 --> 01:19:34.729
maybe like I don't
care that much.

01:19:34.731 --> 01:19:38.166
But I don't wanna do that
anymore. I really like you.

01:19:38.168 --> 01:19:40.468
You haven't been
playing it cool at all.

01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:43.137
You just followed me
into the bathroom.

01:19:43.139 --> 01:19:44.372
Yeah, to talk.

01:19:44.374 --> 01:19:46.508
- I really like you, too!
- Really?

01:19:46.510 --> 01:19:48.142
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:19:50.113 --> 01:19:52.780
- Madam Secretary!
- Yeah! Whoa!

01:19:52.782 --> 01:19:54.616
Madam Secretary!
Listen to me!

01:19:54.618 --> 01:19:56.751
Dance with me,
Steven! Dance!

01:19:56.753 --> 01:19:57.853
We have a situation.

01:19:57.855 --> 01:19:59.222
Huh?

01:20:07.564 --> 01:20:09.430
Yo.

01:20:09.432 --> 01:20:12.467
How much longer is this
Molly stuff gonna last?

01:20:12.469 --> 01:20:14.235
We just re-upped.

01:20:14.237 --> 01:20:16.437
You kept saying you wanted
to take more, so we did.

01:20:16.439 --> 01:20:19.509
So we have another
maybe four or five hours.

01:20:20.678 --> 01:20:22.811
Yeah. Why?

01:20:22.813 --> 01:20:24.647
I'm in so much trouble.

01:20:24.649 --> 01:20:25.714
What's happening?

01:20:25.716 --> 01:20:27.315
I'm gonna be
in so much trouble.

01:20:27.317 --> 01:20:29.519
What's happening?
Are they outta water?

01:20:30.387 --> 01:20:31.553
One of our U2s went down

01:20:31.555 --> 01:20:34.455
while performing a standard
fly-over in Kashtari airspace.

01:20:34.457 --> 01:20:35.557
The pilot was able to eject,

01:20:35.559 --> 01:20:38.561
but it appears he was taken
by the Kashtari military.

01:20:38.563 --> 01:20:40.261
Thank you, General.

01:20:40.263 --> 01:20:41.764
Prime Minister Bharath
is refusing

01:20:41.766 --> 01:20:44.265
to return the pilot
to United States custody.

01:20:44.267 --> 01:20:46.234
He's personally hurt
by the many insults

01:20:46.236 --> 01:20:47.736
hurled at him by POTUS.

01:20:47.738 --> 01:20:49.638
Good job. All right.

01:20:52.409 --> 01:20:53.711
It's gonna be okay
in there, right?

01:20:54.679 --> 01:20:56.112
That's up to you, ma'am.

01:20:57.347 --> 01:20:59.750
Oh, God.
You got this.

01:21:16.834 --> 01:21:19.368
I can hold onto your sunglasses for
you, if you'd like.

01:21:19.370 --> 01:21:24.408
Oh, no. I have alopecia.
In both eyes.

01:21:30.781 --> 01:21:32.246
Hello.

01:21:32.248 --> 01:21:33.214
<i>Secretary Field!</i>

01:21:33.216 --> 01:21:34.316
Oh, my God!

01:21:34.318 --> 01:21:37.185
Hello, Bharath? Hey.

01:21:37.187 --> 01:21:40.556
I hear we have
a situation here?

01:21:40.558 --> 01:21:43.661
One that we both
probably want resolved.

01:21:45.496 --> 01:21:47.930
Very quickly...

01:21:47.932 --> 01:21:50.532
You're not going to bully me
this time, Madam Secretary.

01:21:50.534 --> 01:21:52.234
Your man will stay here

01:21:52.236 --> 01:21:55.204
until your president
personally apologizes to me.

01:21:55.206 --> 01:21:56.207
Over Instagram.

01:21:57.408 --> 01:22:00.378
- He won't do that.
- Yeah, no. Yes...

01:22:01.479 --> 01:22:03.679
- Yo.
- Yes?

01:22:03.681 --> 01:22:05.247
Can I level with you?

01:22:05.249 --> 01:22:06.782
Can I fill you in
on something?

01:22:06.784 --> 01:22:07.816
Go ahead.

01:22:07.818 --> 01:22:09.485
Me and Charlotte,
we're fucked up right now.

01:22:09.487 --> 01:22:10.419
We're on drugs.

01:22:10.421 --> 01:22:11.954
First of all, I don't
wanna talk about that.

01:22:11.956 --> 01:22:13.656
Why? We can't talk
about the drugs.

01:22:13.658 --> 01:22:14.990
Do you know
we're on drugs?

01:22:14.992 --> 01:22:17.528
I don't wanna talk
about that in this room.

01:22:18.729 --> 01:22:19.897
What's happening?

01:22:21.365 --> 01:22:22.431
We're on drugs
right now.

01:22:24.502 --> 01:22:26.268
That's funny.
That's a funny joke!

01:22:26.270 --> 01:22:28.237
What's a joke?
We're on fucking drugs...

01:22:29.473 --> 01:22:30.606
Are we going somewhere?

01:22:32.443 --> 01:22:34.343
What is that?

01:22:34.345 --> 01:22:36.612
What is happening?
We're on drugs right now.

01:22:36.614 --> 01:22:39.314
So you're admitting that
the United States government

01:22:39.316 --> 01:22:41.550
ordered these planes
to spy on my country?

01:22:41.552 --> 01:22:42.618
No.

01:22:43.788 --> 01:22:46.889
No! No! Of course not!

01:22:46.891 --> 01:22:48.992
<i>That's what it sounded like.
Face it.</i>

01:22:48.994 --> 01:22:50.225
You have no leverage here.

01:22:50.227 --> 01:22:53.495
Match his aggression, Madam.
It's the only way out of this.

01:22:53.497 --> 01:22:55.965
I don't know, he seems
really fucking pissed off.

01:22:55.967 --> 01:22:57.466
Get more fucking pissed.

01:22:57.468 --> 01:22:58.870
Let him know
who's really in charge.

01:23:03.774 --> 01:23:05.476
Oh, my God,
that really hurt.

01:23:06.711 --> 01:23:08.477
I gotta be honest,
I'm not...

01:23:08.479 --> 01:23:11.680
I'm not feeling
all this aggression stuff.

01:23:11.682 --> 01:23:15.350
I'm into more of,
like, a chilled vibe.

01:23:15.352 --> 01:23:17.989
You know, just feeling...

01:23:18.924 --> 01:23:20.859
God, are those Gauloises?

01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:23.461
Just, I'm so...

01:23:24.763 --> 01:23:27.231
I'm just gonna bum one.

01:23:29.333 --> 01:23:30.632
Just give me one sec.

01:23:30.634 --> 01:23:31.703
Don't worry.

01:23:39.878 --> 01:23:40.944
Bharath.

01:23:40.946 --> 01:23:42.681
- Hello?
- <i>Listen.</i>

01:23:43.949 --> 01:23:45.884
Mmm. Mmm.

01:23:47.585 --> 01:23:52.389
You and I are in
the same boat, my friend.

01:23:52.958 --> 01:23:54.624
How is that the case?

01:23:54.626 --> 01:23:56.025
<i>We both have to
deal with my boss</i>

01:23:56.027 --> 01:23:59.428
and we both think
he is an asshole.

01:23:59.430 --> 01:24:01.497
You also think
he's an asshole?

01:24:01.499 --> 01:24:02.999
Oh, my God,
he's such an asshole.

01:24:03.001 --> 01:24:04.868
His stupid fucking TV show

01:24:04.870 --> 01:24:06.803
was like,
good for three episodes

01:24:06.805 --> 01:24:08.671
<i>and then it just didn't make
any sense.</i>

01:24:08.673 --> 01:24:10.809
Fuck,
it feels good to say that.

01:24:13.845 --> 01:24:14.846
Listen.

01:24:17.015 --> 01:24:21.084
You need to keep this
on the real DL.

01:24:21.086 --> 01:24:24.521
We both know
that the U.S. does not

01:24:24.523 --> 01:24:27.657
negotiate with terrorists.

01:24:27.659 --> 01:24:33.062
But, we do negotiate
with homies.

01:24:33.064 --> 01:24:35.698
So if you give us
our guy back,

01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:39.836
I'm gonna hook you up
with a sweet aid package.

01:24:39.838 --> 01:24:42.872
<i>So not only do you not have to
keep a guy hostage,</i>

01:24:42.874 --> 01:24:46.643
which is a pretty
shitty thing to do.

01:24:46.645 --> 01:24:48.444
I mean, I've done it myself.

01:24:48.446 --> 01:24:50.515
Don't tell anybody,
super classified.

01:24:51.516 --> 01:24:53.116
It sucks, I hate it.

01:24:53.118 --> 01:24:58.421
Yeah. So,
why don't we instead

01:24:58.423 --> 01:25:02.091
save a ton of lives?

01:25:02.093 --> 01:25:05.495
I mean, that's pretty
fucking awesome, right?

01:25:05.497 --> 01:25:07.098
I think this is
a really good idea.

01:25:10.569 --> 01:25:11.736
What do you say?

01:25:14.472 --> 01:25:15.907
Ma'am.

01:25:20.779 --> 01:25:22.979
Hostage saved, motherfuckers!

01:25:22.981 --> 01:25:25.715
Yeah, yeah!

01:25:25.717 --> 01:25:28.685
- She did it! She did it!
- She did it!

01:25:28.687 --> 01:25:31.421
I'm here with Secretary
of State Charlotte Field.

01:25:31.423 --> 01:25:33.857
Who, after a tense and
complicated negotiation

01:25:33.859 --> 01:25:35.792
with Kashtar,
has secured the release

01:25:35.794 --> 01:25:38.828
of the pilot of the U.S.
spy plane that went down

01:25:38.830 --> 01:25:40.964
over Kashtari airspace.

01:25:40.966 --> 01:25:43.032
- I know, right.
- Crazy.

01:25:43.034 --> 01:25:44.101
And this is all
in the midst

01:25:44.103 --> 01:25:46.703
of the success of
your environmental initiative,

01:25:46.705 --> 01:25:50.140
which I understand has secured
the support of 100 countries.

01:25:50.142 --> 01:25:51.708
- Yes, um...
- Ooh, sore subject.

01:25:51.710 --> 01:25:53.443
I'm very happy
to announce that

01:25:53.445 --> 01:25:56.180
not only do I have the support
of those 100 countries,

01:25:56.182 --> 01:25:58.882
but the president himself
called me personally

01:25:58.884 --> 01:26:00.985
just to tell me how psyched
he is about this initiative...

01:26:00.987 --> 01:26:03.954
- Did he call? Did he call?
- That didn't happen.

01:26:03.956 --> 01:26:05.189
...don't change a word,

01:26:05.191 --> 01:26:08.125
especially the part, uh,
with the trees.

01:26:08.127 --> 01:26:09.759
- That's a lie.
- So, all in all,

01:26:09.761 --> 01:26:10.860
I'm just... Well,

01:26:10.862 --> 01:26:13.796
I kinda feel like I'm just
kinda crushing it right now.

01:26:13.798 --> 01:26:16.102
Thank you so much. So...
Thank you.

01:26:16.801 --> 01:26:17.868
Thank you.

01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:20.204
The incredible
Charlotte Field.

01:26:20.206 --> 01:26:22.538
Who clearly still feels
the effects

01:26:22.540 --> 01:26:25.843
of the intense all-night
hostage situation.

01:26:38.157 --> 01:26:41.025
<i>After negotiating the release
of Lieutenant Gary Smith...</i>

01:26:41.027 --> 01:26:42.960
<i>Charlotte Field's popularity
continues to skyrocket...</i>

01:26:42.962 --> 01:26:44.694
<i>In the newest Gallup poll,
68%...</i>

01:26:44.696 --> 01:26:47.998
<i>...are women mentally unfit
to hold the presidency?</i>

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.833
<i>Here to chat about it
is Chris Brown,</i>

01:26:49.835 --> 01:26:52.202
<i>Jeremy Piven,
and Brett Ratner.</i>

01:26:52.204 --> 01:26:55.005
<i>In the wake of her successful
hostage negotiation,</i>

01:26:55.007 --> 01:26:57.207
<i>Charlotte Field's poll numbers
keep going up.</i>

01:26:57.209 --> 01:26:58.574
<i>I'd like to apologize</i>

01:26:58.576 --> 01:26:59.810
<i>to Charlotte,
and anyone out there</i>

01:26:59.812 --> 01:27:03.049
<i>who was upset yesterday when
I called her Booby-McBoobson.</i>

01:27:04.850 --> 01:27:06.052
Give me
the president's office.

01:27:06.919 --> 01:27:08.986
Yep?

01:27:08.988 --> 01:27:10.621
Can I talk to you
for a second?

01:27:10.623 --> 01:27:12.122
Of course.

01:27:12.124 --> 01:27:14.091
We got some new polling that
I thought I'd share with you.

01:27:14.093 --> 01:27:15.225
All right.

01:27:15.227 --> 01:27:16.794
It feels like
everything

01:27:16.796 --> 01:27:18.028
is kinda falling into place
for us.

01:27:18.030 --> 01:27:19.663
So we thought
we'd dig a little deeper

01:27:19.665 --> 01:27:21.065
and make sure
there are no surprises.

01:27:21.067 --> 01:27:22.800
- Why are you acting so weird?
- It's good.

01:27:22.802 --> 01:27:24.704
We got some really
helpful feedback.

01:27:25.938 --> 01:27:27.671
From the public.

01:27:27.673 --> 01:27:30.941
So we asked
a thousand constituents

01:27:30.943 --> 01:27:32.676
how they would feel

01:27:32.678 --> 01:27:35.746
- if, say, Princess Di...
- Hmm.

01:27:35.748 --> 01:27:37.116
...if she were to
start dating

01:27:38.017 --> 01:27:39.018
Guy Fieri.

01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:42.619
I don't even know
who that is.

01:27:42.621 --> 01:27:44.121
They
don't like that.

01:27:44.123 --> 01:27:46.724
- Yeah.
- Or Kate Middleton

01:27:46.726 --> 01:27:48.926
were to start dating
Danny DeVito.

01:27:48.928 --> 01:27:50.027
I see where you're
going with this.

01:27:50.029 --> 01:27:51.328
Pretty negative reaction.

01:27:51.330 --> 01:27:53.998
Or if Jennifer Lawrence

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:57.169
were to start dating this
potato in a teal windbreaker.

01:27:58.237 --> 01:28:00.137
They would be very upset.

01:28:00.139 --> 01:28:01.638
You did a lot of work,

01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:03.607
- and I...
- Well, but, can I just finish?

01:28:03.609 --> 01:28:05.843
No, that's, like, a lot of...
I get it.

01:28:05.845 --> 01:28:07.745
Madam Secretary.
I have no desire

01:28:07.747 --> 01:28:09.780
- to limit your romantic life.
- Good.

01:28:09.782 --> 01:28:12.616
But the optics of you and Fred

01:28:12.618 --> 01:28:15.085
will make a presidential run
very challenging.

01:28:15.087 --> 01:28:16.321
Fred is a journalist.

01:28:16.323 --> 01:28:18.655
Who's written some
extremely fucked-up stuff.

01:28:18.657 --> 01:28:21.660
No. That's exposed some
really fucked-up stuff.

01:28:22.795 --> 01:28:25.029
And I just want to know
for myself,

01:28:25.031 --> 01:28:28.032
you're comfortable with putting
everything on the line for a hookup?

01:28:28.034 --> 01:28:29.767
Oh, my God.

01:28:29.769 --> 01:28:30.934
Why are we having
this conversation?

01:28:30.936 --> 01:28:32.270
This is insane.

01:28:32.272 --> 01:28:35.172
I don't have to explain myself
to you.

01:28:35.174 --> 01:28:36.907
I'm sorry. I really don't
understand this.

01:28:36.909 --> 01:28:38.309
And I fucking love you,
Charlotte.

01:28:38.311 --> 01:28:39.310
I want you to be happy.

01:28:39.312 --> 01:28:40.911
But more than that,
I want you to be in charge.

01:28:40.913 --> 01:28:42.846
And I want you
to be president.

01:28:42.848 --> 01:28:44.984
For the sake of the future
of our country.

01:28:48.988 --> 01:28:50.656
Look, there's another option.

01:28:52.024 --> 01:28:53.324
There's a guy who works
for the Secret Service

01:28:53.326 --> 01:28:57.395
whose job it is to handle
the mistresses...

01:28:57.397 --> 01:28:58.962
Maggie. You're gonna
have to stop.

01:28:58.964 --> 01:29:01.199
And there are a series
of tunnels in the White House

01:29:01.201 --> 01:29:02.802
- that Woodrow Wilson...
- That's enough.

01:29:05.072 --> 01:29:06.804
Fred is not an idea

01:29:06.806 --> 01:29:09.240
that I'm floating by you
for your approval.

01:29:09.242 --> 01:29:11.278
And you're getting very close
to crossing a line.

01:29:17.017 --> 01:29:18.316
Okay. Got it.

01:29:18.318 --> 01:29:19.752
Goodnight, Madam Secretary.

01:29:25.691 --> 01:29:27.791
<i>When I grow up,
I want to be Charlotte Field.</i>

01:29:27.793 --> 01:29:29.160
<i>Because she's smart and pretty</i>

01:29:29.162 --> 01:29:30.794
<i>and she's going to be
president.</i>

01:29:39.039 --> 01:29:41.873
I will be that
little girl's president.

01:29:41.875 --> 01:29:45.110
Thank you,
and God bless America.

01:29:45.112 --> 01:29:48.279
Massive applause.
Massive cheering.

01:29:48.281 --> 01:29:50.415
At that point, I think
the stage would descend,

01:29:50.417 --> 01:29:54.219
right, and then Lil Uzi Vert
or Charli XCX

01:29:54.221 --> 01:29:56.687
would join hands
with the Harlem Boys Choir...

01:29:56.689 --> 01:29:58.356
Well, I said we'll figure
that out later.

01:30:00.260 --> 01:30:01.793
Uh, Madam Secretary,

01:30:01.795 --> 01:30:03.163
the president would like to
see you right now.

01:30:03.897 --> 01:30:05.031
Shit.

01:30:06.066 --> 01:30:07.132
Damn it!

01:30:07.134 --> 01:30:08.401
The nation is at war!

01:30:09.302 --> 01:30:10.502
I find myself torn.

01:30:10.504 --> 01:30:15.106
Torn between my personal love
and my love of country...

01:30:15.108 --> 01:30:16.774
Sir, is this a good time?

01:30:16.776 --> 01:30:19.811
Oh, hi, Charlotte.
No, I'm just running lines.

01:30:19.813 --> 01:30:20.845
- Oh.
- All right.

01:30:20.847 --> 01:30:22.649
Clear the room. Everybody,
just Charlotte, please.

01:30:26.086 --> 01:30:27.087
Thanks.

01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:32.025
Is everything okay, sir?

01:30:33.093 --> 01:30:35.295
Oh, look who it is.

01:30:36.029 --> 01:30:38.830
She's here at last.

01:30:38.832 --> 01:30:41.266
You gotta love that
secret door. Sit down.

01:30:45.739 --> 01:30:47.238
This feels like an ambush.

01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:49.274
Well, in the
entertainment world,

01:30:49.276 --> 01:30:51.442
we call this a surprise
walk-on.

01:30:51.444 --> 01:30:52.877
You see, Charlotte,

01:30:52.879 --> 01:30:55.446
we have a number of
business interests

01:30:55.448 --> 01:30:58.316
and that, you know,
may be gravely affected

01:30:58.318 --> 01:31:00.285
by this agreement of yours.

01:31:00.287 --> 01:31:02.787
Yeah. Uh, aside from
getting into film,

01:31:02.789 --> 01:31:05.423
I'm looking to use
my connections as president

01:31:05.425 --> 01:31:07.459
to expand
my investment portfolio.

01:31:07.461 --> 01:31:10.128
Sort of like an Ashton Kutcher
type thing, you know.

01:31:10.130 --> 01:31:13.064
I mean, that guy is killing
with acting and investing...

01:31:13.066 --> 01:31:15.900
I think what the president
is trying to say,

01:31:15.902 --> 01:31:18.803
is that the server farm
we want to build in Alaska

01:31:18.805 --> 01:31:22.240
is sitting on 10 miles of land
which will now be

01:31:22.242 --> 01:31:24.144
protected by your initiative.

01:31:24.945 --> 01:31:26.211
Move your server farm.

01:31:26.213 --> 01:31:28.079
We want to
build it in Alaska.

01:31:28.081 --> 01:31:29.847
There's plenty of room
for expansion.

01:31:29.849 --> 01:31:32.817
Charlotte. I'm surprised
that it's come to this.

01:31:32.819 --> 01:31:34.520
You're usually so agreeable.

01:31:34.522 --> 01:31:36.955
But I watched you
undermine me

01:31:36.957 --> 01:31:38.990
on TV the other day.

01:31:38.992 --> 01:31:41.059
TV of all places.

01:31:41.061 --> 01:31:43.094
That's my medium. All right?

01:31:43.096 --> 01:31:46.798
You used TV against me!

01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:49.268
That was your first mistake.

01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:52.204
Look, I'm about to give you
the easiest ultimatum

01:31:52.206 --> 01:31:54.275
that you're ever,
ever gonna receive.

01:31:56.076 --> 01:31:57.809
Drop the tree thing.

01:31:57.811 --> 01:32:00.246
- Or?
- Or...

01:32:00.248 --> 01:32:06.252
We will release the content
of your friend's hard drive.

01:32:06.254 --> 01:32:08.987
We found
a lot of interesting stuff

01:32:08.989 --> 01:32:10.589
when we hacked
into his webcam.

01:32:10.591 --> 01:32:12.859
Now here is a little taster.

01:32:16.062 --> 01:32:19.164
<i>Yo, Charlotte, it's Fred.</i>

01:32:19.166 --> 01:32:20.999
<i>Uh, you want
to come to my room</i>

01:32:21.001 --> 01:32:23.168
<i>and have sex with me
really fast?</i>

01:32:23.170 --> 01:32:26.272
<i>Oh no, don't worry. I'll find
ways to kill time today.</i>

01:32:26.274 --> 01:32:28.073
<i>It's cool. Just let me know
when you're back.</i>

01:32:28.075 --> 01:32:29.143
<i>Great.</i>

01:32:33.547 --> 01:32:35.314
<i>...important to me.</i>

01:32:35.316 --> 01:32:37.949
<i>That's a good speech.</i>

01:32:37.951 --> 01:32:39.951
<i>The band of misfits
fight back...</i>

01:32:39.953 --> 01:32:41.855
- <i>Nice dress.</i>
- <i>...against the bullies.</i>

01:32:43.190 --> 01:32:44.390
<i>Never giving up.</i>

01:32:44.392 --> 01:32:45.524
<i>Never laying down.</i>

01:32:48.596 --> 01:32:50.095
<i>In high school,</i>

01:32:50.097 --> 01:32:51.365
<i>I would talk about
the underdog a lot.</i>

01:32:53.634 --> 01:32:56.368
<i>And I would often find myself
on a soapbox</i>

01:32:56.370 --> 01:32:59.104
<i>rambling on and on
about the injustices</i>

01:32:59.106 --> 01:33:00.274
<i>of the world.</i>

01:33:02.443 --> 01:33:04.176
<i>Which makes you
extremely popular...</i>

01:33:05.913 --> 01:33:07.479
<i>...especially when everybody
would rather be watching</i>

01:33:07.481 --> 01:33:09.248
Beverly Hills, 90210.

01:33:17.091 --> 01:33:19.091
Oh, wow.

01:33:24.098 --> 01:33:25.900
<i>Oh, boy!</i>

01:33:28.936 --> 01:33:31.537
<i>Oh, no...</i>

01:33:31.539 --> 01:33:33.005
<i>Yucky.</i>

01:33:35.309 --> 01:33:36.375
<i>Oh, boy!</i>

01:33:36.377 --> 01:33:38.079
What the fuck?

01:33:39.413 --> 01:33:44.383
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry this happened.

01:33:44.385 --> 01:33:46.118
- You don't have to be sorry.
- What do we do?

01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:48.120
This is what everyone
was afraid was gonna happen,

01:33:48.122 --> 01:33:49.188
because of me.

01:33:49.190 --> 01:33:50.623
And now it's happening
because of me.

01:33:50.625 --> 01:33:51.924
- Do I get a publicist?
- No.

01:33:51.926 --> 01:33:53.158
- Do I do a publicity tour?
- Stop.

01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:54.326
Do we have
a press conference?

01:33:54.328 --> 01:33:57.298
Fred, listen to me.
I took the deal.

01:33:58.933 --> 01:33:59.998
What?

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.333
We scratched the tree thing

01:34:01.335 --> 01:34:03.936
and I have a real shot
at becoming president.

01:34:03.938 --> 01:34:09.041
And some billionaire
motherfucker

01:34:09.043 --> 01:34:12.978
gets to blackmail you?
Using me?

01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:15.247
Doing something
that everybody does?

01:34:15.249 --> 01:34:17.249
Out of a policy
that you cared about,

01:34:17.251 --> 01:34:18.718
since you were
in middle school.

01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:20.452
Since I've known you,
you've cared about this.

01:34:20.454 --> 01:34:22.054
And now you're just gonna
get rid of it?

01:34:22.056 --> 01:34:26.258
I'm trying to compromise here
for a bigger goal.

01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:27.393
Well, I don't think
you should right now.

01:34:27.395 --> 01:34:28.495
Oh, my God!

01:34:28.497 --> 01:34:30.095
Of course
you don't think I should.

01:34:30.097 --> 01:34:32.097
You never compromise
for anything in your life,

01:34:32.099 --> 01:34:33.733
which gives you
the perfect excuse to fail.

01:34:33.735 --> 01:34:36.636
Well, it's better than
maybe bending over backwards

01:34:36.638 --> 01:34:38.103
for anyone who asked,

01:34:38.105 --> 01:34:39.539
to the point that
you don't even know

01:34:39.541 --> 01:34:41.140
why the fuck you're doing
this shit anymore!

01:34:41.142 --> 01:34:42.742
In my world,
in order to achieve

01:34:42.744 --> 01:34:44.677
what I'm trying to achieve,
I have to compromise.

01:34:44.679 --> 01:34:45.745
Oh, why,
because you're a woman?

01:34:45.747 --> 01:34:47.146
Yeah, motherfucker.

01:34:47.148 --> 01:34:48.381
Okay, that makes sense.

01:34:48.383 --> 01:34:50.983
And because I'm not giving up
everything I've ever wanted

01:34:50.985 --> 01:34:53.285
just because it doesn't
live up to your moral code.

01:34:53.287 --> 01:34:55.555
I don't care if this tape
comes out. I really don't.

01:34:55.557 --> 01:34:57.590
- Oh, my God, Fred.
- I'll be okay.

01:34:57.592 --> 01:34:59.461
You don't have to
do this for me.

01:35:01.496 --> 01:35:03.365
You're not doing this for me.

01:35:04.566 --> 01:35:06.098
Obviously.

01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:10.035
Look, you and I both know

01:35:10.037 --> 01:35:12.004
the woman who stands
beside the guy

01:35:12.006 --> 01:35:14.340
that's coming on his face
gets way more scrutiny

01:35:14.342 --> 01:35:17.343
than the guy who's actually
coming on his face.

01:35:17.345 --> 01:35:19.111
Don't know if that's
happened enough

01:35:19.113 --> 01:35:20.680
for there to be, like,
a precedent for it.

01:35:20.682 --> 01:35:23.383
So, who knows? Maybe that
won't be the case this time.

01:35:23.385 --> 01:35:25.185
Who knows? Maybe people
will think it's romantic.

01:35:25.187 --> 01:35:26.719
I'm jerking...
I'm jerking off to you.

01:35:26.721 --> 01:35:28.354
You don't know how people
are gonna react.

01:35:28.356 --> 01:35:30.358
I'm not taking that risk.

01:35:34.329 --> 01:35:35.397
I can't do it.

01:35:36.798 --> 01:35:38.266
Okay.

01:35:44.339 --> 01:35:48.210
So the video doesn't come out,
what happens to us?

01:35:53.548 --> 01:35:57.717
I was talking to Maggie,
and she knows

01:35:57.719 --> 01:36:00.186
this consultant who could
scrub your history.

01:36:00.188 --> 01:36:01.721
We could make sure
nothing else like this

01:36:01.723 --> 01:36:04.092
pops up and surprises us.

01:36:04.626 --> 01:36:05.792
And then we just...

01:36:05.794 --> 01:36:07.227
We work on your image,

01:36:07.229 --> 01:36:09.162
and we figure out
how we want to

01:36:09.164 --> 01:36:11.631
present ourselves
as a couple to the public.

01:36:11.633 --> 01:36:12.767
That's all.

01:36:18.073 --> 01:36:20.206
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:36:20.208 --> 01:36:21.374
How long...
How long will it take,

01:36:21.376 --> 01:36:24.344
do you think, to create

01:36:24.346 --> 01:36:27.247
an image of me that we can
present to the public?

01:36:27.249 --> 01:36:30.818
Just through the first couple
months of the campaign.

01:36:30.820 --> 01:36:33.386
You think? But you don't
know that, right?

01:36:33.388 --> 01:36:34.687
It could take longer
than that.

01:36:34.689 --> 01:36:37.090
In a couple of months,
you could find that it's not a good moment

01:36:37.092 --> 01:36:39.626
to introduce
a new boyfriend, right?

01:36:39.628 --> 01:36:41.829
And then we'd have to wait
a couple more months.

01:36:41.831 --> 01:36:44.432
I don't know how long
it's gonna take, Fred.

01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:47.567
And then meanwhile,

01:36:47.569 --> 01:36:49.471
you're pretending
not to date me.

01:36:50.639 --> 01:36:53.506
And you're scrubbing
my Internet history?

01:36:53.508 --> 01:36:55.275
So my articles are gone.

01:36:55.277 --> 01:36:57.210
And you, like, sneak me around

01:36:57.212 --> 01:36:59.178
like I'm Marilyn Monroe
and you're JFK?

01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:00.346
Is that what
we're talking about?

01:37:00.348 --> 01:37:03.483
I just want to be clear,
that's what we're talking about.

01:37:03.485 --> 01:37:05.821
And we have to do that
because I'm...

01:37:07.355 --> 01:37:08.523
...not right.

01:37:10.358 --> 01:37:13.126
And then once we present us
to the world,

01:37:13.128 --> 01:37:17.667
we present a version of me
that isn't... actually me?

01:37:21.369 --> 01:37:22.437
Yeah.

01:37:31.814 --> 01:37:33.248
I can't do it.

01:37:35.383 --> 01:37:37.484
I wish

01:37:37.486 --> 01:37:40.590
that I was the type of person
that could, but I can't.

01:37:49.765 --> 01:37:51.366
You don't have to do it.

01:38:12.488 --> 01:38:14.488
Don't know what the fuck
I was thinking.

01:38:14.490 --> 01:38:18.425
Why the fuck
I thought someone like her

01:38:18.427 --> 01:38:20.259
and someone like me
could work?

01:38:20.261 --> 01:38:23.397
She's a fucking politician.
Like, I don't even know her.

01:38:23.399 --> 01:38:25.966
Like, I don't know who she is.

01:38:25.968 --> 01:38:28.936
She has no moral compass.

01:38:28.938 --> 01:38:31.605
She's working with fucking
Democrats one day,

01:38:31.607 --> 01:38:33.240
Republicans the next
fucking day.

01:38:33.242 --> 01:38:34.308
I mean, what's wrong
with working

01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:35.676
with Democrats
and Republicans?

01:38:35.678 --> 01:38:37.411
That's...
That's the whole country.

01:38:37.413 --> 01:38:40.614
Uh, yeah,
except fuck Republicans,

01:38:40.616 --> 01:38:42.282
I guess is the problem
with that.

01:38:42.284 --> 01:38:45.686
Speaking as an American,
shouldn't you see both sides?

01:38:45.688 --> 01:38:48.489
Yeah. I see
one side's fucking wrong.

01:38:48.491 --> 01:38:50.991
What's the problem here?

01:38:50.993 --> 01:38:52.660
I'm a Republican.

01:38:52.662 --> 01:38:54.428
You're fucking joking
right now.

01:38:54.430 --> 01:38:57.631
Member of the GOP!
Yeah, you know me.

01:38:57.633 --> 01:38:58.966
You're a Republican.

01:38:58.968 --> 01:38:59.867
Yeah, I'm a Republican!

01:38:59.869 --> 01:39:02.336
The shit has worked out
so far for me.

01:39:02.338 --> 01:39:03.904
What the fuck, man?

01:39:03.906 --> 01:39:05.439
All that shit
you're always saying to me!

01:39:05.441 --> 01:39:06.640
- Yeah.
- Pull yourself up

01:39:06.642 --> 01:39:09.309
by your bootstraps. And being
in charge of your own destiny.

01:39:09.311 --> 01:39:11.545
- Republican shit.
- Oh, and it worked on me.

01:39:11.547 --> 01:39:13.280
And it works
on a lot of people.

01:39:13.282 --> 01:39:14.448
Oh, that's fucking sick.

01:39:14.450 --> 01:39:15.549
That's right.

01:39:15.551 --> 01:39:16.917
Ugh! That's gross!

01:39:16.919 --> 01:39:18.852
That Republican shit,
you put it in my brain

01:39:18.854 --> 01:39:20.954
and it made me feel good.
That's fucked up, man!

01:39:20.956 --> 01:39:22.423
Come on. See, this is what
I'm talking about,

01:39:22.425 --> 01:39:23.524
your negative way of thinking.

01:39:23.526 --> 01:39:24.792
I don't even know you!

01:39:24.794 --> 01:39:25.659
- What do you mean?
- Ugh!

01:39:25.661 --> 01:39:27.261
I'm the same dude
from two minutes ago.

01:39:27.263 --> 01:39:28.328
Your best friend.

01:39:28.330 --> 01:39:29.563
Why'd you never tell me this?

01:39:29.565 --> 01:39:31.699
'Cause I knew you'd act exactly
how you're acting right now.

01:39:31.701 --> 01:39:33.367
Wait a minute.

01:39:33.369 --> 01:39:35.869
You're always talking about how, like,
the universe has a plan for all of us...

01:39:35.871 --> 01:39:36.837
Take it easy.

01:39:36.839 --> 01:39:38.772
There's someone watching
over us at all times.

01:39:38.774 --> 01:39:40.741
- Yeah.
- Does that mean...

01:39:40.743 --> 01:39:41.878
I'm a man of Christian faith.

01:39:42.478 --> 01:39:44.511
What the fuck!

01:39:44.513 --> 01:39:46.014
Now, come on now!
We pray for you!

01:39:46.016 --> 01:39:47.514
Don't pray for me! Keep it!

01:39:47.516 --> 01:39:49.583
- Lord.
- Oh, stop it. Ignore him, God!

01:39:49.585 --> 01:39:51.552
- He doesn't mean that.
- Don't pray for me!

01:39:51.554 --> 01:39:52.720
You are trippin' right now.

01:39:52.722 --> 01:39:53.787
I'm not fucking trippin'!
How could you be Christian?

01:39:53.789 --> 01:39:58.492
I wear this cross, every day,
since you've known me!

01:39:58.494 --> 01:39:59.660
What did you think it was for?

01:39:59.662 --> 01:40:02.063
I thought it was...

01:40:02.065 --> 01:40:03.630
...a cultural thing.

01:40:03.632 --> 01:40:05.367
You mean like,
'cause I'm black?

01:40:06.702 --> 01:40:07.838
That's what
I thought, yeah.

01:40:08.504 --> 01:40:09.570
That might be.

01:40:09.572 --> 01:40:11.806
But that don't mean
what you said ain't racist.

01:40:11.808 --> 01:40:13.875
- You're right.
- Yeah, I know I'm right!

01:40:13.877 --> 01:40:15.542
- Fuck.
- That's racist as shit!

01:40:15.544 --> 01:40:16.778
All right, dude...

01:40:16.780 --> 01:40:18.645
I love you, man.

01:40:18.647 --> 01:40:21.648
But you're very judgmental.
They don't want politics

01:40:21.650 --> 01:40:23.785
to get into this,
because you've never really

01:40:23.787 --> 01:40:25.586
been good at looking at shit

01:40:25.588 --> 01:40:27.454
from other people's
perspective, Fred.

01:40:27.456 --> 01:40:28.890
- I know.
- It might explain

01:40:28.892 --> 01:40:31.626
why you haven't been able to look
at this through Charlotte's eyes.

01:40:31.628 --> 01:40:32.694
I'm sorry.

01:40:32.696 --> 01:40:34.629
I'm sorry you couldn't be
who you are around me,

01:40:34.631 --> 01:40:37.031
and you had to
hide your true self.

01:40:37.033 --> 01:40:38.365
That's really fucked up.

01:40:38.367 --> 01:40:39.433
That's all right, man.

01:40:39.435 --> 01:40:43.370
But my love for the GOP
and the G-O-D

01:40:43.372 --> 01:40:45.106
has nothing to do with us.

01:40:45.108 --> 01:40:47.041
I'm racist.
You're a Republican.

01:40:47.043 --> 01:40:49.476
I don't know
what the fuck's going on.

01:40:50.847 --> 01:40:53.014
Polls suggested
I should get into yoga,

01:40:53.016 --> 01:40:54.716
which I did and it turns out,

01:40:54.718 --> 01:40:56.017
I don't really like yoga.

01:40:56.019 --> 01:40:59.487
Don't you sometimes just wish
you could say,

01:40:59.489 --> 01:41:00.688
"Fuck the polls"?

01:41:00.690 --> 01:41:05.994
Well, polls say that people
find my laugh unattractive.

01:41:05.996 --> 01:41:07.796
So I shouldn't laugh
in public.

01:41:07.798 --> 01:41:08.930
That was a bit of a bummer,

01:41:08.932 --> 01:41:11.432
because I really,
I like to laugh.

01:41:11.434 --> 01:41:12.867
- A lot.
- Hmm.

01:41:12.869 --> 01:41:15.003
Um, but we came up
with another laugh

01:41:15.005 --> 01:41:16.738
that was better.
That's more, uh...

01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:18.573
- Presidential, I guess.
- Hmm.

01:41:20.110 --> 01:41:21.109
That's good.

01:41:21.111 --> 01:41:22.744
It's a lot of teeth
and not too much sound.

01:41:22.746 --> 01:41:25.413
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

01:41:25.415 --> 01:41:27.582
So, um, after dinner,

01:41:27.584 --> 01:41:29.150
how about we go
for a drink somewhere?

01:41:29.152 --> 01:41:30.418
Ooh.

01:41:30.420 --> 01:41:33.588
I know this great little place
that's not too far from here.

01:41:33.590 --> 01:41:35.924
It's called Mini Bar.

01:41:35.926 --> 01:41:40.128
It's quite exclusive, you need
a little key to access it.

01:41:40.130 --> 01:41:44.432
And you get charged
as you remove the bottle.

01:41:44.434 --> 01:41:46.034
- Hmm.
- It's actually more of

01:41:46.036 --> 01:41:47.769
a small fridge than a bar.

01:41:47.771 --> 01:41:49.637
- And it's in my room...
- No, I get it.

01:41:49.639 --> 01:41:51.072
I'm inviting you
back to my room.

01:41:51.074 --> 01:41:53.743
I...

01:41:55.745 --> 01:41:57.812
- That was my real laugh.
- Mmm!

01:41:57.814 --> 01:41:58.947
I don't know why

01:41:58.949 --> 01:42:01.351
they told you
not to use that laugh.

01:42:02.752 --> 01:42:03.887
It's...

01:42:10.694 --> 01:42:12.594
Big day tomorrow,
Madam Secretary.

01:42:14.965 --> 01:42:16.833
Yeah. Big day.

01:42:36.853 --> 01:42:39.156
Okay. "Hey, it's Fred."

01:43:02.579 --> 01:43:03.647
Hello?

01:43:05.249 --> 01:43:06.849
Beep.

01:43:06.851 --> 01:43:09.186
<i>Oh, uh, guess I got
your voicemail. Um, hi.</i>

01:43:10.021 --> 01:43:12.254
It's Fred.

01:43:12.256 --> 01:43:15.723
I guess I wanna start
by saying I'm really sorry.

01:43:15.725 --> 01:43:17.826
You were right
about everything

01:43:17.828 --> 01:43:19.931
and I was wrong
about everything.

01:43:21.631 --> 01:43:26.001
And we should go along
with the plan.

01:43:26.003 --> 01:43:29.639
<i>I can be Marilyn.
I can be your Marilyn.</i>

01:43:30.607 --> 01:43:32.107
I'd rather be
your Lady Bird,

01:43:32.109 --> 01:43:35.713
because, you know,
LBJ put a ring on that finger.

01:43:37.647 --> 01:43:41.050
But I would do anything
to continue,

01:43:41.052 --> 01:43:42.753
to be able to be with you.

01:43:46.589 --> 01:43:47.758
Okay, bye.

01:44:02.106 --> 01:44:03.839
So, we're losing
the trees, huh?

01:44:03.841 --> 01:44:06.775
Yeah. POTUS talked me
out of it.

01:44:06.777 --> 01:44:09.044
I know that meant
a lot to you. I'm so sorry.

01:44:09.046 --> 01:44:10.913
Hmm, nothing we can do
about it.

01:44:10.915 --> 01:44:12.314
We need his endorsement.

01:44:12.316 --> 01:44:14.652
- Yep.
- Yep.

01:44:17.321 --> 01:44:19.757
And I am sorry
about you and Fred.

01:44:22.893 --> 01:44:26.061
You know,
he called last night.

01:44:26.063 --> 01:44:28.197
He said he'd do it,
he'd go along with the plan.

01:44:28.199 --> 01:44:31.600
Really? Wow.

01:44:31.602 --> 01:44:33.704
That's a shock.

01:44:35.139 --> 01:44:38.874
Um... Okay.

01:44:38.876 --> 01:44:40.275
I'll... I'll start
to make arrangements.

01:44:40.277 --> 01:44:41.278
No, Maggie.

01:44:42.146 --> 01:44:43.746
There's nothing to do.

01:44:43.748 --> 01:44:45.716
At the end of the day,
it was never gonna work.

01:44:48.619 --> 01:44:51.787
Well, today is
such a good day,

01:44:51.789 --> 01:44:53.756
and I am so excited.

01:44:53.758 --> 01:44:55.224
We should be psyched.

01:44:55.226 --> 01:44:57.826
So psyched.

01:44:57.828 --> 01:44:59.962
All right,
I will see you out there.

01:44:59.964 --> 01:45:01.032
All right.

01:45:20.218 --> 01:45:21.585
Hey, man.

01:45:22.254 --> 01:45:23.321
Can I get a beer?

01:45:24.922 --> 01:45:28.090
- Thanks for coming.
- No problem, bro.

01:45:28.092 --> 01:45:30.726
How you feelin' though?

01:45:30.728 --> 01:45:32.761
Okay, you know,
you were right.

01:45:32.763 --> 01:45:33.962
I called her.

01:45:33.964 --> 01:45:35.798
I left a message.
She didn't call me back.

01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:37.833
So... Whatever.

01:45:37.835 --> 01:45:39.171
Sure you wanna watch this?

01:45:40.138 --> 01:45:41.572
Yeah, I have to.

01:45:43.841 --> 01:45:46.409
Madam Secretary,
I'd like to introduce you

01:45:46.411 --> 01:45:47.343
to Lil Yachty.

01:45:47.345 --> 01:45:49.245
He's going to be
performing after the speech.

01:45:49.247 --> 01:45:50.779
Pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Yachty.

01:45:50.781 --> 01:45:53.116
I'm a big-ass fan. I'm so
excited to vote for you.

01:45:53.118 --> 01:45:55.187
- I'm sorry, it's game time.
- Okay.

01:46:13.238 --> 01:46:14.938
<i>Good morning!</i>

01:46:14.940 --> 01:46:17.909
<i>Thank you, everyone,
for being here with me today.</i>

01:46:19.177 --> 01:46:20.776
<i>Let me start
by saying something</i>

01:46:20.778 --> 01:46:23.146
<i>I haven't said since I was 16</i>

01:46:23.148 --> 01:46:25.215
<i>and worked
at Blockbuster Video.</i>

01:46:27.452 --> 01:46:28.750
<i>I quit...</i>

01:46:28.752 --> 01:46:30.887
I helped write that joke.

01:46:30.889 --> 01:46:32.088
Oh, yeah?
That's a good joke.

01:46:32.090 --> 01:46:34.190
<i>...as secretary of state,</i>

01:46:34.192 --> 01:46:35.825
<i>in order to run</i>

01:46:35.827 --> 01:46:38.995
<i>for president of
the United States of America.</i>

01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:44.136
God bless.

01:46:46.972 --> 01:46:49.472
<i>And I'm honored</i>

01:46:49.474 --> 01:46:53.209
<i>to have the full support
of President Chambers,</i>

01:46:53.211 --> 01:46:55.912
<i>a man I greatly admire.</i>

01:46:55.914 --> 01:46:59.282
<i>A man who is
an extraordinary leader.</i>

01:46:59.284 --> 01:47:01.153
Man, you know
who you should date?

01:47:02.354 --> 01:47:03.889
Taylor Swift.

01:47:05.056 --> 01:47:07.056
Hell, yeah.
I could see that.

01:47:07.058 --> 01:47:10.994
Why... Why do you think
I could date Taylor Swift?

01:47:10.996 --> 01:47:12.795
Fred, you were dating
Charlotte Field.

01:47:12.797 --> 01:47:14.297
That's the most powerful woman
on Earth!

01:47:14.299 --> 01:47:15.832
Oh, I get it.

01:47:15.834 --> 01:47:17.936
I don't know what me and
Taylor Swift have in common.

01:47:19.171 --> 01:47:23.106
Y'all white. Ya ain't got
a care in the world.

01:47:23.108 --> 01:47:24.340
That's true.

01:47:24.342 --> 01:47:26.311
<i>But this campaign
is not about me.</i>

01:47:27.012 --> 01:47:28.845
<i>It's about you.</i>

01:47:28.847 --> 01:47:30.079
<i>It's about us.</i>

01:47:31.283 --> 01:47:32.882
<i>It's about how together,</i>

01:47:32.884 --> 01:47:36.953
<i>we can build the future
our fellow Americans deserve.</i>

01:47:40.058 --> 01:47:43.026
<i>I have dreamt
about this moment</i>

01:47:43.028 --> 01:47:45.261
<i>ever since
I was a little girl</i>

01:47:45.263 --> 01:47:47.365
<i>growing up
in the nation's capital.</i>

01:47:50.001 --> 01:47:53.537
<i>And I know
that if that young girl</i>

01:47:53.539 --> 01:47:57.008
<i>could see me
standing up here right now...</i>

01:48:02.314 --> 01:48:04.983
<i>She would be so...</i>

01:48:08.220 --> 01:48:09.921
<i>She would be...</i>

01:48:16.362 --> 01:48:17.496
What's happening?

01:48:19.097 --> 01:48:22.734
<i>She... She would be so
disappointed in me, actually.</i>

01:48:24.437 --> 01:48:27.971
<i>Yeah, the truth is, that girl</i>

01:48:27.973 --> 01:48:29.172
<i>would want me to be honest</i>

01:48:29.174 --> 01:48:31.841
<i>and have integrity and not be</i>

01:48:31.843 --> 01:48:35.248
<i>blackmailed by evil people
with evil agendas.</i>

01:48:37.483 --> 01:48:39.316
<i>So instead, I'm just gonna...</i>

01:48:39.318 --> 01:48:42.453
<i>I'm just gonna tell the truth,
and whatever happens, happens.</i>

01:48:42.455 --> 01:48:44.421
<i>So here we go.</i>

01:48:44.423 --> 01:48:48.091
<i>Parker Wembley
and our dumb-fuck president...</i>

01:48:48.093 --> 01:48:49.393
Whoo!

01:48:49.395 --> 01:48:50.594
<i>...are doing some
evil shit together.</i>

01:48:50.596 --> 01:48:52.329
<i>And because
I just told you now,</i>

01:48:52.331 --> 01:48:55.932
<i>they're going to release
a video of a guy I dated</i>

01:48:55.934 --> 01:48:58.269
<i>jerking off all over himself.</i>

01:48:58.271 --> 01:48:59.270
Release the video.

01:48:59.272 --> 01:49:01.338
Get the fucking thing online.
Get it online!

01:49:01.340 --> 01:49:03.842
<i>But don't slut shame me. I...</i>

01:49:05.144 --> 01:49:06.212
<i>I like him.</i>

01:49:06.945 --> 01:49:08.512
<i>I like him a lot.</i>

01:49:08.514 --> 01:49:10.516
Fred, you gotta go to her.

01:49:12.618 --> 01:49:14.884
Go get her ass, man.

01:49:14.886 --> 01:49:16.222
<i>And he jerks off.</i>

01:49:18.557 --> 01:49:20.624
<i>And so do all of you.</i>

01:49:20.626 --> 01:49:21.891
Hell, yeah!

01:49:21.893 --> 01:49:24.094
<i>So deal with it.</i>

01:49:24.096 --> 01:49:25.564
<i>Deal with it, America.</i>

01:49:34.507 --> 01:49:36.540
Hey! I'm Fred!

01:49:36.542 --> 01:49:38.208
Is that an XL?

01:49:38.210 --> 01:49:39.476
I've got five stars in it,

01:49:39.478 --> 01:49:40.978
if you could speed
this shit up, man!

01:49:40.980 --> 01:49:42.313
We'll give you extra tip,
real tip.

01:49:42.315 --> 01:49:43.647
Not Uber tip! Cash tip!

01:49:43.649 --> 01:49:46.018
Get back! Get back!

01:49:49.088 --> 01:49:51.190
- Where are we going?
- I don't know.

01:49:55.127 --> 01:49:56.393
She's leaving?
Where is she going?

01:49:56.395 --> 01:49:58.195
Shit, I don't know.
This isn't on the itinerary.

01:49:58.197 --> 01:50:00.364
Tom, you have to think past
the itinerary!

01:50:00.366 --> 01:50:01.298
I can't.

01:50:01.300 --> 01:50:03.133
Fred, I just got
a Wembley news alert

01:50:03.135 --> 01:50:05.336
- with your name on it.
- Don't open it!

01:50:05.338 --> 01:50:08.038
<i>Oh, yeah! Oh, boy!</i>

01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:09.440
Oh, Fred!

01:50:09.442 --> 01:50:12.443
Oh, no. Oh, no.

01:50:12.445 --> 01:50:13.644
Hey, it's all right, man.

01:50:13.646 --> 01:50:15.312
You know,
we all got our things.

01:50:15.314 --> 01:50:17.014
I don't bust a nut
on my face.

01:50:17.016 --> 01:50:19.216
- But, like...
- It's not like a thing I do!

01:50:20.386 --> 01:50:22.219
Do you think that'll,
like, go viral?

01:50:22.221 --> 01:50:25.057
This is the news!

01:50:25.659 --> 01:50:27.326
Oh, shit.

01:50:35.267 --> 01:50:38.502
Excuse me. Move, damn it!
This man is in love.

01:50:38.504 --> 01:50:40.371
<i>Secretary Field
just drove away,</i>

01:50:40.373 --> 01:50:42.439
<i>no comment
as to her destination.</i>

01:50:42.441 --> 01:50:44.576
<i>We're gonna keep tracking
this story for you...</i>

01:50:44.578 --> 01:50:46.410
<i>Yo, check it out.
It's the come-guy!</i>

01:50:46.412 --> 01:50:48.112
- <i>Yeah, that's him!</i>
- <i>Oh, sir,</i>

01:50:48.114 --> 01:50:49.313
<i>just a couple of questions.
We're live right now.</i>

01:50:49.315 --> 01:50:52.449
<i>No! I'm come-guy?</i>

01:50:52.451 --> 01:50:54.151
No comments at this time,
thank you! Thank you!

01:50:54.153 --> 01:50:55.285
Thank you!

01:50:55.287 --> 01:50:57.390
Do not touch him!
Do not touch him!

01:51:12.138 --> 01:51:13.205
Hi.

01:51:14.206 --> 01:51:15.374
Holy shit.

01:51:17.477 --> 01:51:19.011
Did you see my speech?

01:51:20.246 --> 01:51:22.982
Yeah. I think
everyone saw it.

01:51:23.450 --> 01:51:24.451
Yeah.

01:51:27.253 --> 01:51:29.188
You know,
your video's out there.

01:51:30.089 --> 01:51:31.591
Yeah, I caught that.

01:51:38.598 --> 01:51:40.567
Here's the deal.
I love you.

01:51:42.335 --> 01:51:44.436
I know I do.

01:51:44.438 --> 01:51:47.407
Because I've never been
so scared in my entire life.

01:51:50.377 --> 01:51:55.080
And I once shared an elevator
with Saddam Hussein.

01:51:56.416 --> 01:51:58.585
Just me and Saddam.

01:52:01.655 --> 01:52:03.523
And this is way scarier.

01:52:06.460 --> 01:52:07.993
I love you.

01:52:11.131 --> 01:52:13.598
Okay, you're really gonna have
to say something right now.

01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:15.202
'Cause I'm freaking out.

01:52:18.070 --> 01:52:20.340
I've been in love with you
since I was 12 years old.

01:52:41.461 --> 01:52:42.462
Oh.

01:52:44.164 --> 01:52:45.230
Hello?

01:52:45.232 --> 01:52:48.299
Hey, Fred, uh, there's
a million people out here

01:52:48.301 --> 01:52:50.702
and they want to talk to the
candidate and the come-guy.

01:52:50.704 --> 01:52:52.539
So, I figured they'd hit you.

01:53:13.426 --> 01:53:14.761
Fred!

01:53:15.729 --> 01:53:17.264
Fred!

01:53:22.569 --> 01:53:25.503
A crazy day.

01:53:25.505 --> 01:53:27.740
But I'm really glad
you're all here.

01:53:27.742 --> 01:53:29.810
I'd like to introduce you
to someone.

01:53:31.177 --> 01:53:32.245
This is Fred.

01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:34.147
Hi, there.

01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:37.750
My boyfriend.

01:53:37.752 --> 01:53:39.119
Whoo!

01:53:42.422 --> 01:53:44.355
You kind of
know him already,

01:53:44.357 --> 01:53:46.457
but you'll get to
know him a lot more

01:53:46.459 --> 01:53:47.762
in the next few months...

01:53:48.963 --> 01:53:51.596
'Cause he's gonna be right by
my side on my campaign trail.

01:54:02.242 --> 01:54:04.110
Wakanda Forever!

01:54:12.319 --> 01:54:14.587
Charlotte! Charlotte!

01:54:14.589 --> 01:54:17.190
Charlotte! Charlotte!

01:54:18.358 --> 01:54:19.825
I started the chant!

01:54:19.827 --> 01:54:21.762
I started that chant!

01:54:25.499 --> 01:54:27.198
<i>...that I will
faithfully execute</i>

01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:30.436
<i>the office of the president
of the United States.</i>

01:54:30.438 --> 01:54:31.804
<i>What a momentous day,</i>

01:54:31.806 --> 01:54:33.304
<i>our first female president.</i>

01:54:33.306 --> 01:54:35.239
<i>I never thought I'd see it.</i>

01:54:35.241 --> 01:54:36.942
<i>Well, I mean, a lot of people
are gonna say</i>

01:54:36.944 --> 01:54:38.944
<i>this is a historic moment
for women everywhere,</i>

01:54:38.946 --> 01:54:41.212
<i>but do we really want
her finger on the button</i>

01:54:41.214 --> 01:54:42.548
<i>when it's that time
of the month?</i>

01:54:42.550 --> 01:54:44.416
<i>I wouldn't want
my wife making any decision</i>

01:54:44.418 --> 01:54:45.751
<i>during that time
of the month.</i>

01:54:45.753 --> 01:54:47.586
<i>You know what?
Fuck you guys. I quit.</i>

01:54:47.588 --> 01:54:49.187
<i>Looks like it's someone's
time of the month.</i>

01:54:49.189 --> 01:54:50.723
- <i>Oh!</i>
- <i>Looks like Aunt Flow</i>

01:54:50.725 --> 01:54:52.591
<i>is going to work down at
the Red River Casino... Oh!</i>

01:54:52.593 --> 01:54:53.826
Jesus Christ!
Quick, quick, cut!

01:54:53.828 --> 01:54:58.196
Hi! I'm the First Mister of
the United States of America.

01:54:58.198 --> 01:54:59.665
My name is Fred Field.

01:54:59.667 --> 01:55:00.833
I took my wife's last name.

01:55:00.835 --> 01:55:04.903
And, uh, I'm gonna give you
a tour of the White House.

01:55:04.905 --> 01:55:07.873
We're starting with the
portraits of the first spouses.

01:55:07.875 --> 01:55:09.742
Here we have
Mamie Eisenhower.

01:55:09.744 --> 01:55:10.809
Jackie Kennedy.

01:55:10.811 --> 01:55:13.646
We have the beautiful
Lady Bird Johnson's portrait.

01:55:13.648 --> 01:55:16.382
And that leads us
into my portrait.

01:55:16.384 --> 01:55:18.651
It was painted by
Todd McFarlane,

01:55:18.653 --> 01:55:21.220
who created the Spawn comics,
of course.

01:55:21.222 --> 01:55:22.890
<i>The first versions
were a little over the top.</i>

01:55:24.625 --> 01:55:26.692
Hi, guys.

01:55:26.694 --> 01:55:28.560
<i>I used to think the best
way for me to change the world,</i>

01:55:28.562 --> 01:55:30.462
to make it a better place
was through journalism.

01:55:30.464 --> 01:55:31.930
Then I realized
that's not at all the case.

01:55:31.932 --> 01:55:35.534
Really, the best thing I could
be doing for the world

01:55:35.536 --> 01:55:38.537
is just supporting
this amazing person

01:55:38.539 --> 01:55:40.339
and just trying to
learn from her

01:55:40.341 --> 01:55:41.874
and kinda just trying to be

01:55:41.876 --> 01:55:44.410
the best first mister
I can be.

01:55:44.412 --> 01:55:46.979
I actually got a tattoo
of the first mister insignia.

01:55:46.981 --> 01:55:49.782
- He did.
- There we are.

01:55:49.784 --> 01:55:50.949
You're wearing mittens.

01:55:50.951 --> 01:55:52.351
Got little mittens on.

01:55:52.353 --> 01:55:54.853
If you think of where this tattoo
started to where it ended up.

01:55:54.855 --> 01:55:56.789
It really has
an amazing arc to it.

01:55:56.791 --> 01:55:59.725
What are some of
the perks of your new roles?

01:55:59.727 --> 01:56:03.029
Well, I finally get to enact
my vision for America.

01:56:03.031 --> 01:56:05.264
I finally got to find out
who killed Kennedy.

01:56:05.266 --> 01:56:06.498
- Oh, my God. Don't you dare.
- I won't say.

01:56:06.500 --> 01:56:07.666
- Don't.
- I won't say.

01:56:07.668 --> 01:56:08.767
Fred, I'm not
kidding around.

01:56:08.769 --> 01:56:09.835
It's not who you think!

01:56:09.837 --> 01:56:11.370
Don't do it.

01:56:11.372 --> 01:56:12.440
It's pretty surprising.

01:56:13.374 --> 01:56:14.873
He's my Mister.

01:56:14.875 --> 01:56:17.511
I'm her Mister.
And she's my president.
