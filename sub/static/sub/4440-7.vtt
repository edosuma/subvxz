00:09.590 --> 00:12.360
(door opens, footsteps approach)

00:12.361 --> 00:14.830
Uh! Must be 90 degrees in here!

00:14.831 --> 00:16.364
Turn on your air conditioning.

00:16.366 --> 00:17.466
I wish I could--
it's broken.

00:17.467 --> 00:19.368
(air conditioner hums)

00:19.369 --> 00:21.537
Oh, I guess it's fixed now.

00:21.538 --> 00:23.006
That's so weird.

00:23.007 --> 00:25.208
Okay. You owe me 60 bucks

00:25.209 --> 00:26.476
for Aunt Cindy's
birthday present.

00:26.477 --> 00:27.678
60 bucks?

00:27.679 --> 00:30.281
Are you having money problems?

00:30.282 --> 00:33.118
No, just waiting
for funds to clear.

00:33.119 --> 00:35.521
Ryan, you know that
if you need any help,

00:35.522 --> 00:37.056
all you have to do is ask.

00:39.126 --> 00:40.593
But you do have to ask.

00:40.594 --> 00:43.897
WILFRED: Shut up! Shut up,
shut up, shut up!

00:43.898 --> 00:45.866
Come on. Let's just get
this over with. How much?

00:45.867 --> 00:47.868
I don't need your money.

00:47.869 --> 00:51.806
Okay, just call me when
you get desperate enough.

00:51.807 --> 00:54.042
Assuming your phone
isn't broken.

00:54.043 --> 00:55.643
WILFRED:
Bitch!

00:57.179 --> 00:59.346
(turns off air conditioner)

00:59.347 --> 01:02.749
(slow, rhythmic squeaking)

01:04.352 --> 01:06.053
(clears throat)

01:06.054 --> 01:08.021
Oh, hello, mate.

01:08.022 --> 01:09.456
I'm going to the mall
to get some free AC.

01:09.457 --> 01:10.757
Sounds like a plan.

01:10.758 --> 01:12.559
I'll just finish up here.

01:12.560 --> 01:14.294
Close your eye, Bear.

01:17.298 --> 01:20.468
Ah! That feels so good.

01:20.469 --> 01:22.803
What do you mean,
"It wasn't real"?

01:22.804 --> 01:25.240
Oh, what, we're having
a little cry now, are we?

01:25.241 --> 01:28.376
Come on, Bear,
don't be like that.

01:28.377 --> 01:31.747
You realize what you're doing
here is ridiculous, right?

01:31.748 --> 01:33.550
Let's just get out of here

01:33.551 --> 01:35.585
before the waterworks
start up again.

01:35.586 --> 01:37.687
I don't know, Ryan.

01:37.688 --> 01:40.824
Sometimes I get the feeling
maybe Bear isn't the one.

01:40.825 --> 01:42.826
Maybe you need to
spice things up.

01:42.827 --> 01:45.129
Take Bear to a nice restaurant.

01:45.130 --> 01:47.131
- You think?
- No!

01:47.132 --> 01:48.933
It's a semen-drenched
teddy bear.

01:51.870 --> 01:53.704
I've got bigger things
to worry about.

01:53.705 --> 01:55.773
I pretty much burned
through my savings.

01:55.774 --> 01:57.575
I might have to get a job.

01:57.576 --> 01:58.742
Hey!

01:58.743 --> 02:00.377
Jobs are for immigrants.

02:00.378 --> 02:02.246
Why didn't you tell me
you were short, mate?

02:02.247 --> 02:03.780
What's mine is yours.

02:03.781 --> 02:06.216
Do you forget what
we did last night?

02:06.217 --> 02:08.418
It's Monopoly.

02:08.419 --> 02:10.152
It's not real money.
How many times

02:10.154 --> 02:11.521
do I have to tell you that?

02:11.522 --> 02:13.123
One more times.

02:13.124 --> 02:15.191
- It's not real money.
- Shit!

02:15.192 --> 02:17.327
And I was winning
until you punched me,

02:17.328 --> 02:19.429
grabbed the money,
tipped over the table and ran.

02:19.430 --> 02:21.165
I keeps it gangster, Ryan.

02:21.166 --> 02:23.400
You knew that about me
before we set up the board.

02:23.401 --> 02:25.102
If I don't get a job,

02:25.103 --> 02:26.503
I'm gonna have to ask
Kristen for money.

02:26.504 --> 02:28.038
There's no way in hell
I'm doing that.

02:28.039 --> 02:30.040
That's just stubborn pride.

02:30.041 --> 02:31.541
She's your sister, mate.

02:31.542 --> 02:32.743
She loves you.

02:32.744 --> 02:34.744
Bleed the bitch dry.

02:34.745 --> 02:36.379
I'm not asking for help.

02:36.380 --> 02:37.747
It's too humiliating.

02:37.748 --> 02:41.384
There must be an easier way.

02:41.385 --> 02:43.286
There is.

02:43.287 --> 02:45.187
(tires squeal, bang)
What the hell?!

02:45.188 --> 02:46.622
Now we sue.

02:47.757 --> 02:49.257
I'm so sorry.

02:49.258 --> 02:50.558
My-my dog jumped over my seat...

02:50.559 --> 02:52.227
You are a horrible driver!

02:52.228 --> 02:53.628
Just give me
your insurance card.

02:53.629 --> 02:54.896
Uh...

02:59.702 --> 03:02.037
(blows air, sniffs)

03:02.038 --> 03:03.939
(farts, sniffs)

03:05.000 --> 03:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:12.182 --> 03:14.250
Well, hello there.

03:14.251 --> 03:16.485
Nice box.

03:16.486 --> 03:18.019
"Between insurance policies"?

03:18.020 --> 03:19.621
What the hell does that mean?

03:19.622 --> 03:21.056
Well, I thought maybe we
could work something out.

03:21.057 --> 03:23.191
Shut up!
Here's what's gonna happen:

03:23.192 --> 03:24.759
my assistant's gonna get
an estimate on this,

03:24.760 --> 03:27.428
and you are gonna show up
at my office today at exactly...

03:27.429 --> 03:29.364
6:15, and you be there
with your checkbook

03:29.365 --> 03:31.332
or I'll call the cops,
drag you into court

03:31.333 --> 03:33.434
and sue your nuts off.
(shutter clicks)

03:33.435 --> 03:36.537
You are lucky
I'm such a nice person.

03:38.607 --> 03:40.074
(engine starts)

03:40.075 --> 03:41.342
Wait, Raffi...

03:41.343 --> 03:43.177
Give us your digits.

03:43.178 --> 03:44.479
Are you on Facebook?

03:44.480 --> 03:46.314
Are you insane?

03:46.315 --> 03:47.649
Thanks to you, I'm gonna have

03:47.650 --> 03:49.150
to pay that woman
thousands of dollars.

03:50.519 --> 03:53.455
And thanks to you, I'm going

03:53.456 --> 03:56.258
to town on the deepest throat
in the stuffed animal kingdom.

03:57.761 --> 04:00.129
Now that I've met Raffi,

04:00.130 --> 04:01.697
how can I go back to Bear?

04:01.698 --> 04:04.034
I mean, sure, Bear put me
though obedience school,

04:04.035 --> 04:06.002
but does that mean
I have to be unhappy

04:06.003 --> 04:07.704
for the rest of my life?

04:07.705 --> 04:09.973
If you couldn't see the decline
of aluminum futures coming,

04:09.974 --> 04:11.207
you're a goddamn mental midget.

04:11.208 --> 04:12.842
You're done, Michael.

04:12.843 --> 04:14.343
Go upstairs,
clean out your desk

04:14.344 --> 04:16.111
and make it fast.

04:16.112 --> 04:19.014
You, crash boy, inside.

04:22.551 --> 04:24.318
You brought your dog-- classy.

04:24.319 --> 04:27.021
Sorry, I'm watching him
for a friend.

04:27.022 --> 04:29.589
What?

04:29.590 --> 04:32.192
Oh, I have had him all week.

04:32.193 --> 04:34.294
You know, you'd think you'd want
your child for the weekend.

04:34.295 --> 04:36.463
At least your girlfriend
will have someone to watch

04:36.464 --> 04:38.098
<i>Thomas the Tank Engine with.</i>

04:38.099 --> 04:39.567
$4,800?

04:39.568 --> 04:41.368
There's no way
I can afford this.

04:41.369 --> 04:45.105
Single mom, lonely, vulnerable.
(woman conversing)

04:45.106 --> 04:46.306
Perhaps you have something

04:46.307 --> 04:47.875
that's worth more
to her than money.

04:47.876 --> 04:49.376
What are you talking about?

04:49.377 --> 04:50.644
I'm talking about
lovemaking so passionate

04:50.645 --> 04:52.712
she wakes up the next morning
with a limp.

04:52.713 --> 04:54.214
Just keep out of this.

04:54.215 --> 04:55.682
You know what, Graham?
Forget it.

04:55.683 --> 04:57.584
I'll tell him that you're dead.

04:57.585 --> 04:59.519
(sighs) I'm sorry.

04:59.520 --> 05:02.155
It's just been...
it's been one of those weeks.

05:02.156 --> 05:04.124
I've had weeks like that.

05:04.125 --> 05:05.358
Months, actually.

05:05.359 --> 05:07.761
But those things are temporary.

05:07.762 --> 05:10.730
You're an attractive,
successful women.

05:10.731 --> 05:12.666
Oh, just write the check
and get out. (sobs)

05:12.667 --> 05:14.935
Beth--
like every woman--

05:14.936 --> 05:17.571
is a delicate flower.

05:17.572 --> 05:19.706
She may say she wants
your money,

05:19.707 --> 05:23.210
but what she really needs
is nurturing, tenderness

05:23.211 --> 05:25.311
and a nasty sex limp.

05:29.383 --> 05:32.685
Thank you.

05:32.686 --> 05:34.520
Did you really mean
what you said?

05:34.521 --> 05:37.090
You...

05:37.091 --> 05:38.958
you find me attractive?

05:38.959 --> 05:41.293
Well...

05:41.294 --> 05:43.662
yes, of course.

05:43.663 --> 05:45.297
Oh, bullshit.

05:45.298 --> 05:46.698
You probably think
I'm a total bitch.

05:46.699 --> 05:48.833
But believe me,
when I'm not in this office,

05:48.834 --> 05:53.037
or in a car accident,
I'm actually a very nice person.

05:55.542 --> 05:56.976
So are you.

05:56.977 --> 05:58.344
(both chuckle)

05:58.345 --> 06:00.580
- Ask her out to dinner.
- Dinner?

06:00.581 --> 06:02.182
Oh, my God, what a lovely idea.

06:02.183 --> 06:04.952
How about this Saturday night...

06:07.389 --> 06:09.725
...my place.

06:09.726 --> 06:12.327
Um...

06:12.328 --> 06:13.996
Mmm...

06:13.997 --> 06:16.632
Oh!

06:16.633 --> 06:18.934
Oh.

06:26.683 --> 06:27.983
(wolf whistles)

06:27.984 --> 06:29.618
Take it easy.

06:29.619 --> 06:31.054
I'm just going
to Beth's for dinner

06:31.055 --> 06:32.989
and to work out
a reasonable payment plan.

06:32.990 --> 06:34.723
(refined voice):
Nonsense, my dear boy.

06:34.724 --> 06:36.759
As a nobleman once said,

06:36.760 --> 06:38.561
"You can't have dinner

06:38.562 --> 06:40.764
without 'in her,' as in

06:40.765 --> 06:42.699
'get up in her.'"

06:42.700 --> 06:45.869
What is that? That voice?
What is that?

06:45.870 --> 06:48.605
What voice...
my dear boy?

06:48.606 --> 06:50.674
Cut the crap.
You may have shampooed

06:50.675 --> 06:52.042
and parted your hair
to the side,

06:52.043 --> 06:53.911
but you're still
the same old Wilfred.

06:53.912 --> 06:56.380
All you care about is humping
that little kid's giraffe.

06:56.381 --> 06:57.682
(refined voice):
Why, Ryan,

06:57.683 --> 06:59.650
what a villain you paint me as.

06:59.651 --> 07:01.386
It's elementary.

07:01.387 --> 07:03.888
Beth gets serviced,
the debt gets wiped

07:03.889 --> 07:06.658
and the giraffe gets
a proper buggering.

07:06.659 --> 07:08.660
All win.

07:08.661 --> 07:12.297
I'm not gonna put out
just to erase a debt.

07:12.298 --> 07:13.932
(normal voice):
Nicely done, Ryan.

07:13.933 --> 07:16.935
You make the easy way out
sound like a bloody curse.

07:16.936 --> 07:18.603
Okay then, we won't go.

07:18.604 --> 07:21.439
Just call your sister
and ask for the money.

07:23.709 --> 07:27.579
Look, there's no shame
in admitting you need help.

07:27.580 --> 07:30.783
Swallow your pride,
pick up the phone,

07:30.784 --> 07:33.385
and this whole situation
disappears.

07:36.556 --> 07:40.325
No, that's not an option.

07:40.326 --> 07:42.027
(refined voice):
Then go to her Ryan.

07:42.028 --> 07:44.897
Go to Beth
as I shall go to Raffi.

07:44.898 --> 07:46.432
Let us walk together

07:46.433 --> 07:48.902
towards our destinies
bravely...

07:48.903 --> 07:51.705
sexually.

07:51.706 --> 07:53.774
Fine, I'll go to dinner,

07:53.775 --> 07:55.777
but only if you stop
talking like that.

07:55.778 --> 07:57.412
(normal voice):
Deal...

08:00.348 --> 08:02.283
(refined voice):
...my dear boy.

08:02.284 --> 08:03.751
So you-you really
didn't have

08:03.752 --> 08:04.985
to go to all this trouble.

08:04.986 --> 08:06.720
Oh, well, I usually order in,

08:06.721 --> 08:08.723
but tonight I wanted
to do something special,

08:08.724 --> 08:11.358
so I had my assistant
whip up a home-cooked meal.

08:11.359 --> 08:15.429
It's not often I have such
charming company. (chuckles)

08:15.430 --> 08:19.666
So, hey, listen, about
the money I owe you.

08:19.667 --> 08:20.767
- I was thinking...
- Oh, Ryan,

08:20.768 --> 08:22.469
I talk about money all day long.

08:22.470 --> 08:25.272
Please, let's not spoil
a beautiful dinner.

08:29.778 --> 08:31.578
I don't know.

08:31.579 --> 08:33.447
I guess since then,

08:33.448 --> 08:36.015
I've devoted my life
to chasing dreams,

08:36.017 --> 08:38.684
be they in the forms
of cars or other.

08:38.686 --> 08:42.655
I think a life lived with
passion is a life well-lived.

08:42.657 --> 08:44.758
But enough about me.

08:44.759 --> 08:46.960
What makes Raffi tick?

08:46.961 --> 08:48.962
Hey, do you mind?!

08:48.963 --> 08:50.364
We're having a
conversation here,

08:50.365 --> 08:51.966
you adorable little
piece of shit.

08:51.967 --> 08:54.035
You know what
I like about you, Ryan?

08:54.036 --> 08:55.904
You're not afraid to go after
what you want.

08:55.905 --> 08:57.605
I like an aggressive man.

08:59.808 --> 09:03.777
It makes me feel so small
and vulnerable...

09:03.778 --> 09:06.346
(girlish voice):
like a wittle bunny.

09:06.347 --> 09:10.751
A bad... wittle bunny.

09:10.752 --> 09:15.421
So, uh, $4,800 divided
by 24 months is...

09:15.422 --> 09:16.689
Ryan, Ryan.
Hmm?

09:16.690 --> 09:18.458
I told you no more
talk about money.

09:18.459 --> 09:20.659
I'm sure we can work
something out later...

09:20.660 --> 09:22.494
once Tyler goes to sleep.

09:22.495 --> 09:24.730
And besides,

09:24.731 --> 09:27.732
(girlish voice): wittle Bethie
bunny just got a Bwazilian.

09:27.733 --> 09:28.700
(silverware clatters)

09:28.701 --> 09:30.434
Mmm...

09:30.435 --> 09:32.503
What are you doing
with this little boy?

09:32.504 --> 09:34.371
What you need is a real man,

09:34.372 --> 09:36.741
a man with hair on his chest...

09:36.742 --> 09:38.510
and his back,

09:38.511 --> 09:39.911
and his ass,

09:39.912 --> 09:42.715
and his neck
and his forehead.

09:42.716 --> 09:45.918
A man who can afford
the finer things in life.

09:45.919 --> 09:50.223
Tyler, sweetie,

09:50.224 --> 09:51.792
ready for bed?

09:51.793 --> 09:54.061
What? No, no.

09:54.062 --> 09:55.696
You're not tired,
are you, buddy?

09:55.697 --> 09:57.431
What do you say we play a game?

09:57.432 --> 09:58.732
Games suck.

09:58.733 --> 10:01.067
Don't be rude.
He's very tired.

10:01.068 --> 10:02.636
He'll be asleep any second.

10:02.637 --> 10:04.103
Uh, wait, wait.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.772
Tyler hasn't had
his dessert yet.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.740
He doesn't need any dessert.
Look at his tits.

10:07.741 --> 10:09.641
Ryan, can I talk to
you alone for a minute?

10:09.642 --> 10:11.877
Excuse me just...

10:13.746 --> 10:15.380
(hushed):
What are you doing?!

10:15.381 --> 10:16.915
No one gets laid
while that kid's awake.

10:16.916 --> 10:18.316
Exactly.

10:18.317 --> 10:19.618
Be right back.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.519
Finally.

10:21.520 --> 10:23.455
I thought that precocious little
beaver dam would never break.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.356
I can't do this.

10:25.357 --> 10:27.258
I can't make love to someone
I'm not connected to.

10:27.259 --> 10:28.894
This is so humiliating.

10:28.895 --> 10:30.728
More humiliating than asking
your sister for help?

10:30.729 --> 10:32.697
Dude, dude.

10:32.698 --> 10:34.532
Check out the look
Raffi's giving me.

10:36.001 --> 10:37.835
Girl is a freak.

10:37.836 --> 10:39.436

10:39.437 --> 10:41.472

11:33.427 --> 11:36.763
(Ryan grunts)

11:36.764 --> 11:39.099
Can... can we slow things down?

11:39.100 --> 11:41.635
Wittle bunny wikes it
down there.

11:41.636 --> 11:42.869
I know, but we're moving
a little...

11:44.739 --> 11:46.773
Yeah, maybe I didn't
make myself clear.

11:46.774 --> 11:49.409
Little bunny wants cunnilingus
performed on her

11:49.410 --> 11:50.711
because it's the only way

11:50.712 --> 11:51.912
the little bunny
can achieve orgasm.

11:51.913 --> 11:53.747
(grunts)

11:53.748 --> 11:55.282
I need to pee!

11:55.283 --> 11:56.750
Before we get started!

11:56.751 --> 11:58.385
(groans)

12:00.021 --> 12:02.355
Wash your hands!

12:02.356 --> 12:03.790
(urine splashing)

12:06.627 --> 12:07.960
Ryan.

12:07.961 --> 12:08.794
What are you doing?

12:08.795 --> 12:10.696
Same thing you're doing

12:10.697 --> 12:13.499
except all over
that little brat's Big Wheel.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.534
We have to get out of here.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.736
Are you kidding me?

12:17.737 --> 12:19.539
This is the best sex
I've ever had.

12:19.540 --> 12:21.474
For a gal who's never been
out of the box,

12:21.475 --> 12:23.743
Raffi really thinks
outside of the box.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.044
I'm freaking out.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.981
Beth wants me to... you know.

12:27.982 --> 12:29.583
Oh, I see.

12:29.584 --> 12:31.652
A little yodeling
in the old canyon, eh?

12:31.653 --> 12:33.521
- I just don't think I can.
- Well, you should have

12:33.522 --> 12:35.823
- thought of that before you crashed
into her car. - Me? It was...

12:35.824 --> 12:37.992
You think Beth's gonna let you off
the hook if you don't get back in there

12:37.993 --> 12:40.461
- and give her what she wants?
- Well, no, but...

12:42.898 --> 12:45.432
(coughs)

12:45.433 --> 12:46.667
That's really strong.

12:46.668 --> 12:48.402
That'll do the trick.

12:48.403 --> 12:49.903
Now pull yourself together.

12:49.904 --> 12:51.438
You're a cornered animal.

12:51.439 --> 12:52.872
You have a choice to make--

12:52.873 --> 12:54.974
it's eat or be eaten.

12:54.975 --> 12:58.010
Find the animal within.

12:58.011 --> 13:00.747
(continues urinating)

13:00.748 --> 13:04.685
Goddamn, this must be
some kind of record.

13:04.686 --> 13:07.121
I'm an idiot
for not timing this.

13:11.626 --> 13:13.261
(softly):
Oh, thank God.

13:32.549 --> 13:33.716
(sighs)

13:35.352 --> 13:37.386
Morning.

13:37.387 --> 13:38.754
Morning, Tyler.

13:38.755 --> 13:40.055
Morning.

13:40.056 --> 13:42.558
- Eggs?
- Actually...

13:42.559 --> 13:44.694
I-I should be going.

13:44.695 --> 13:48.497
Oh, I guess you had enough
to eat last night, hmm?

13:48.498 --> 13:53.134
Did you enjoy your little...
midnight snack?

13:53.135 --> 13:56.871
- I want more cereal.
- Tyler, go to your room.

13:56.872 --> 14:00.843
Uh, what do you mean,
midnight snack?

14:00.844 --> 14:04.080
You know, when you woke me up
with that thing you did.

14:05.282 --> 14:07.017
To my wabbit hole?

14:07.018 --> 14:08.918
That thing I did?

14:08.919 --> 14:10.854
It was like there was
an animal down there.

14:23.134 --> 14:25.868
So we're at the bowling alley
last night, shitfaced,

14:25.869 --> 14:29.337
and one of Ryan's mates puts
a call out for spastic bowling.

14:29.338 --> 14:30.972
So Ryan-- I didn't think
he'd do this--

14:30.973 --> 14:33.308
he starts throwing
the ball overarm,

14:33.309 --> 14:35.377
making palsy faces and shit.

14:35.378 --> 14:37.046
I didn't agree
with that, actually.

14:37.047 --> 14:40.383
I told you, after bowling
we smoked Hong Kong's on the beach

14:40.384 --> 14:42.585
with some homeless pricks.
What's with the third degree?

14:42.586 --> 14:43.853
May I speak with you?

14:43.854 --> 14:45.789
Privately?

14:45.790 --> 14:48.692
Oh, anything you can say to me,
you can say in front of Bear.

14:48.693 --> 14:50.360
Okay. So last night at Beth's...

14:50.361 --> 14:52.596
Whoa! Let's take it upstairs.

14:53.865 --> 14:55.899
Not cool, dude.

14:55.900 --> 14:57.401
You said I could say anything.

14:57.402 --> 14:58.902
I assumed it was
an open relationship.

14:58.903 --> 15:00.804
It is, but Bear
doesn't know that.

15:00.805 --> 15:02.605
Look, this morning
Beth implied that

15:02.606 --> 15:04.975
there may have been a certain
act performed last night,

15:04.976 --> 15:07.477
and I don't remember
participating in that act.

15:07.478 --> 15:09.413
You were stoned
out of your mind, Ryan.

15:09.414 --> 15:11.881
Perhaps you found
the animal within.

15:11.882 --> 15:14.351
Or perhaps you snuck into the
bedroom while we were asleep.

15:14.352 --> 15:16.253
I don't have time to argue
about what did who.

15:16.254 --> 15:17.788
I have to rest up before

15:17.789 --> 15:20.057
tonight's encore
performance with Raffi.

15:20.058 --> 15:21.725
Oh, no, that was
a one night only deal.

15:21.726 --> 15:23.727
Look, I just want to forget
this whole thing ever happened.

15:23.728 --> 15:25.796
- But Raffi and I were gonna...
- No!

15:25.797 --> 15:27.764
As you wish, Ryan.

15:27.765 --> 15:31.636
We'll just stay in and play
Monopoly again... or Battleship.

15:31.637 --> 15:33.805
You cheat at that, too.

15:33.806 --> 15:35.940
Battleships change locations
in the middle of a war, Ryan.

15:35.941 --> 15:38.510
It's what they
were designed to do!

15:40.379 --> 15:42.647
(phone rings)

15:46.920 --> 15:48.587
Hello.

15:48.588 --> 15:50.255
Yes.

15:50.256 --> 15:52.824
Beth?

15:52.825 --> 15:54.793
The answer is yes.

15:54.794 --> 15:56.895
I got the flowers you sent.

15:56.896 --> 15:58.296
I sent you flowers?

15:58.297 --> 15:59.764
And I love the card.

15:59.765 --> 16:03.401
"Beth, you were amazing.

16:03.402 --> 16:05.736
Looking forward to an encore
performance tonight."

16:05.737 --> 16:07.938
(laughs) I didn't realize

16:07.939 --> 16:10.240
this was going to be
an ongoing thing.

16:10.241 --> 16:11.875
It's quite a surprise.

16:11.876 --> 16:13.978
Yes, it is.

16:13.979 --> 16:16.047
Come by the house tonight
after 9:00.

16:16.048 --> 16:17.782
Tyler should be asleep by then,

16:17.783 --> 16:23.322
but, uh, wittle bunny
will be wide awake.

16:27.562 --> 16:29.863
(music playing on video,
running footsteps on stairs)

16:29.864 --> 16:31.464
Dude!

16:31.465 --> 16:33.767
- Ever heard of knocking?
- Flowers?

16:33.768 --> 16:36.636
You sent her flowers?
I was home free!

16:36.637 --> 16:39.105
Okay, I'll admit I betrayed you,
but in my defense,

16:39.106 --> 16:42.408
I really, really want to have
sex with Raffi again.

16:42.409 --> 16:44.777
So it's one of those arguments

16:44.778 --> 16:47.379
when neither of us is right,
neither of us is wrong.

16:47.380 --> 16:49.548
We're both kinda swimming
in gray area.

16:49.549 --> 16:51.350
This ends tonight.
It's about time

16:51.351 --> 16:52.885
I take control
of this situation.

16:52.886 --> 16:55.421
(grunts) Beth, please,

16:55.422 --> 16:56.756
there's something
I need to tell you.

16:56.757 --> 16:59.659
(gasps) Look, I think
you're a terrific lady,

16:59.660 --> 17:01.828
but I don't see us
having a future together.

17:01.829 --> 17:05.565
Any sort of future.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.434
I see.

17:07.435 --> 17:09.502
And if that means that I have

17:09.503 --> 17:12.372
to pay for the accident, then...

17:12.373 --> 17:15.675
No, no, it was a, uh,
it was a tacit agreement.

17:15.675 --> 17:18.578
I suppose you have some contract
you'd like me to sign.

17:18.579 --> 17:21.614
(clears throat) Well, uh,

17:21.615 --> 17:23.549
I used to be a lawyer.

17:23.550 --> 17:25.818
(paper rustling)

17:25.819 --> 17:28.053
This, this absolves me

17:28.054 --> 17:30.589
of any cost in relation
to the accident.

17:30.590 --> 17:32.224
Just give me the pen.

17:35.462 --> 17:36.930
Although since this is

17:36.931 --> 17:39.900
now technically
a business transaction,

17:39.901 --> 17:42.069
I would be doing myself
a disservice

17:42.070 --> 17:44.404
if I didn't negotiate a little...

17:46.575 --> 17:47.808
...signing bonus.

17:47.809 --> 17:49.644
Uh...

17:49.645 --> 17:51.312
Ding-ding, round two.

17:52.648 --> 17:54.782
(sighs)

18:01.456 --> 18:03.591
Uh...

18:03.592 --> 18:07.228
that's nice, but that's not
what you did last night.

18:07.229 --> 18:08.796
What do you mean?

18:08.797 --> 18:11.298
Wight bunny, wong hole.

18:13.035 --> 18:15.670
- What, is something wrong?
- Uh...

18:15.671 --> 18:17.773
You know what? Maybe you should
just get your checkbook.

18:17.774 --> 18:21.377
No, no, no!
Uh, you know,

18:21.378 --> 18:24.514
I-I think part of what made
last night so exciting

18:24.515 --> 18:25.849
was that you were asleep.

18:25.850 --> 18:29.853
Maybe I could
wake you up again.

18:29.854 --> 18:32.956
Oh...

18:32.957 --> 18:36.426
Suddenly, I feel vewy sweepy.

18:42.600 --> 18:44.667
Wash your hands.

18:47.371 --> 18:49.706
(muffled grunting)

18:51.909 --> 18:53.943
(gasping):
Ryan, I'm in over my head.

18:53.944 --> 18:56.245
Turns out Raffi wasn't
fresh out of the box.

18:56.246 --> 18:57.713
She was returned.

18:57.714 --> 19:00.550
Beth wants a repeat
of last night.

19:00.551 --> 19:02.018
I need your help.

19:03.721 --> 19:05.422
All right,
I'll-I'll help you, Ryan.

19:05.423 --> 19:06.690
I'll do anything for ya.

19:06.691 --> 19:09.659
But first you need to help me.

19:09.660 --> 19:11.662
Raffi wants to cuckold me.

19:11.663 --> 19:13.363
What?

19:13.364 --> 19:15.399
It's a form of sexual
degradation whereby

19:15.400 --> 19:17.535
I'm forced to watch as she's
ravaged by someone else;

19:17.536 --> 19:19.871
a lesser, physically
inadequate lover.

19:19.872 --> 19:22.006
She asked for you specifically.

19:22.007 --> 19:24.576
You want me to have sex
with a stuffed giraffe?

19:24.577 --> 19:26.211
"Want" has nothing
to do with it.

19:26.212 --> 19:28.214
Do you need my help or not?

19:32.353 --> 19:34.353
I can't do this.

19:34.354 --> 19:36.056
Please, Ryan, this is hard
enough for me as it is.

19:36.057 --> 19:38.157
- This is insane.
- Just screw the giraffe.

19:39.860 --> 19:41.828
Why am I doing this?

19:41.829 --> 19:44.296
So you don't have to call
your sister and be humiliated.

19:48.436 --> 19:50.504
What are you doing?

19:50.505 --> 19:51.639
Mom!

19:51.640 --> 19:53.273
I'm gonna ask Kristen for help.

19:53.274 --> 19:55.075
I think so, mate.

19:58.780 --> 20:00.748
I'm getting  too old for this shit.

20:00.749 --> 20:02.850
I'm thinking it might be time
for me to settle down

20:02.851 --> 20:04.652
and make a commitment.

20:04.653 --> 20:07.722
I'm not young anymore.
I'm seven...

20:07.723 --> 20:09.223
and a half.

20:09.224 --> 20:12.726
Beside, I need more of a
spiritual connection these days.

20:12.727 --> 20:15.929
Something like what I've got
with Bear.

20:15.930 --> 20:18.432
Ah! Bloody hell!

20:18.433 --> 20:20.667
Teeth, Bear, teeth!

20:26.040 --> 20:27.173
Mmm.

20:27.174 --> 20:29.209
Think I got you here.

20:29.210 --> 20:32.679
Okay, it-it's Colonel Mustard
 in the study

20:32.680 --> 20:33.847
with the wrench.

20:33.848 --> 20:35.715
No.

20:38.986 --> 20:41.355
- Ah!
- I won.
