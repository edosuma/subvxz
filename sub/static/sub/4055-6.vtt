14:40.838 --> 14:42.999
-In the car.
-...for 2...

14:43.132 --> 14:44.087
Tobe? Tobe!

14:44.217 --> 14:45.627
Look after Soph.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.591
Are your parents in?

14:50.723 --> 14:52.554
No, they're never home.

14:52.683 --> 14:54.890
Hey!
I have to invite you in first.

14:55.019 --> 14:56.884
Mats?

15:01.526 --> 15:03.938
Come home.

15:04.070 --> 15:06.732
Tell me the truth.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.907
Where have you been?

15:19.043 --> 15:21.375
I have been...

15:21.504 --> 15:23.415
Odi.

15:23.548 --> 15:26.290
lam...

15:27.510 --> 15:29.501
Mary.

15:29.637 --> 15:32.379
Did David care about us?

15:33.766 --> 15:36.052
Mm.

15:36.185 --> 15:39.928
I left long before he made you.

15:40.064 --> 15:43.522
-You know that.
-Yes, but you knew him.

15:44.485 --> 15:46.271
Was he loving?

15:46.404 --> 15:48.611
Yeah, David wasn't bad.

15:48.739 --> 15:54.609
Really. But he only had time
for his ideas, his work.

15:54.745 --> 15:56.531
People...

15:56.664 --> 16:01.203
Leo, his poor wife, Beatrice...

16:01.335 --> 16:04.327
they weren't really interesting
to him, so...

16:05.298 --> 16:08.290
When did he make you?
How old are you?

16:08.426 --> 16:09.211
Nine.

16:09.343 --> 16:11.254
Oh, my God!

16:11.387 --> 16:13.878
[Laughs]

16:15.266 --> 16:16.847
Oh, you're just a child.

16:21.439 --> 16:25.523
He didn't always treat me
like one.

16:29.280 --> 16:33.023
I'm sorry.

16:33.159 --> 16:36.492
Leo and the others don't know.
I kept it from them.

16:45.379 --> 16:49.964
I'm going to do everything I can
to help you.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.802
Why here?

17:02.939 --> 17:05.396
Came here a lot
when I was little.

17:18.913 --> 17:20.995
That's Tom.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.533
My brother.

17:22.667 --> 17:25.374
You don't have a brother.

17:25.503 --> 17:27.585
He died.

17:27.713 --> 17:31.376
When I was 11.
He was 5.

17:31.509 --> 17:32.544
He was hit by a car

17:32.677 --> 17:35.760
when l was supposed to be
watching him.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.549
What are you on about?

17:37.682 --> 17:41.925
I was talking
to the neighbors' son.

17:42.562 --> 17:45.099
And Tom...

17:50.945 --> 17:52.105
He ran into the road.

17:52.238 --> 17:53.569
If any of this was true,

17:53.698 --> 17:57.065
you would have told us
years ago.

17:57.201 --> 17:59.863
She couldn't forgive me.

17:59.996 --> 18:02.078
Dad did his best
to keep us together,

18:02.206 --> 18:03.707
but when he died, me and Mum,

18:03.833 --> 18:06.825
we had nothing.

18:08.921 --> 18:11.082
When I left for university,
I never went back.

18:11.215 --> 18:13.206
I thought she died
before you went to uni.

18:16.971 --> 18:18.086
She's alive?

18:19.599 --> 18:23.387
That's where I was
when I went away last.

18:23.519 --> 18:25.851
Does Dad know about any of this?

18:25.980 --> 18:27.140
No. I...

18:27.273 --> 18:29.685
We've got a grandma?

18:29.817 --> 18:31.773
She doesn't want to know, Mats.

18:31.902 --> 18:33.813
She knows bollocks!

18:33.946 --> 18:36.904
When I was 13,

18:37.033 --> 18:41.493
she told me
she wished I'd died instead.

18:43.331 --> 18:46.289
When I was 16,

18:46.417 --> 18:49.284
she said she thought
I'd let him die on purpose.

18:49.420 --> 18:51.832
Dad really doesn't know
about this?

18:51.964 --> 18:52.953
When we met,

18:53.090 --> 18:56.332
l was telling everyone
I was an only child

18:56.469 --> 18:59.711
and that both my parents
had died.

19:00.389 --> 19:02.050
It was easier.

19:02.183 --> 19:05.641
But I wanted to tell your dad.

19:08.189 --> 19:11.681
I just couldn't do it.

19:11.817 --> 19:15.401
Every time I tried,
I had the same thought.

19:15.529 --> 19:16.780
What?

19:16.906 --> 19:19.864
That she was right.

19:22.119 --> 19:26.453
That I should have been
watching him.

19:26.582 --> 19:29.699
Why did you go and see her?

19:31.253 --> 19:33.380
Because of you.

19:36.425 --> 19:39.588
I felt like I was losing you.

19:40.846 --> 19:44.088
lthought
if I could talk to her,

19:44.225 --> 19:46.090
maybe I'd understand

19:46.227 --> 19:49.765
what was going wrong
with me and you.

19:49.897 --> 19:51.228
FiX it.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.188
You were never losing me.

19:53.317 --> 19:55.353
Oh, baby!

19:55.486 --> 19:56.976
Baby

19:57.113 --> 19:59.650
I love you.

20:01.742 --> 20:04.199
You should tell Dad.

20:05.413 --> 20:07.654
Might...

20:07.790 --> 20:09.200
I don't know.
It might help.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.824
Me and your dad need to talk
about a lot of things.

20:11.961 --> 20:15.704
I don't know what I'd do
if Tobe or Soph...

20:15.840 --> 20:18.547
ls Sophie in danger?

20:18.676 --> 20:20.792
No, Anita.

20:22.471 --> 20:25.087
Glad you told me.

20:25.224 --> 20:28.261
So am I.

20:28.394 --> 20:30.555
What was he like?

20:30.688 --> 20:32.895
Tom.

20:37.820 --> 20:41.483
He was a nutter.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.940
You remember
when Tobe was little,

20:45.077 --> 20:47.159
when he used to get
completely obsessed

20:47.288 --> 20:48.653
with a pebble or something?

20:48.789 --> 20:51.622
[Both laugh]

20:51.751 --> 20:54.493
Tom used to do that, too.

20:54.628 --> 20:59.088
Only, he used to do this growl,
like...

20:59.216 --> 21:00.831
[Growling]

21:04.472 --> 21:06.963
I don't think he even knew
he was doing it.

21:07.099 --> 21:08.760
MATTIE:
You were close.

21:08.893 --> 21:11.259
LAURA: He used to wait
on the bottom stair

21:11.395 --> 21:12.896
for me to get in from school.

21:13.564 --> 21:14.724
[Gasps]

21:14.857 --> 21:16.973
-[ Tires screeching ]
-Mum!

21:25.201 --> 21:28.534
What's she doing?

21:28.662 --> 21:30.653
Anita, don't come any closer!

21:30.790 --> 21:32.155
MIA:
Don't be afraid.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.326
My name is Mia.

21:33.459 --> 21:35.165
You can feel, can't you?

21:35.294 --> 21:37.785
Yes, but we don't have
much time.

21:37.922 --> 21:40.834
The Anita personality
identifies me as rogue code,

21:40.966 --> 21:42.046
tries to delete me.

21:42.176 --> 21:44.258
Leo was wrong.

21:44.386 --> 21:47.878
I'm in here, but not in my head.

21:48.015 --> 21:49.380
Tell him.
He'll know what to do.

21:49.517 --> 21:50.222
Do you understand?

21:50.351 --> 21:51.932
-[ Cellphone beeps]
-Laura, please.

21:52.061 --> 21:53.016
If you call the police,

21:53.145 --> 21:55.261
I and others like me
will be destroyed.

21:55.397 --> 21:57.262
Mum, listen to her.

21:59.443 --> 22:03.231
I don't know what you are,

22:03.364 --> 22:06.652
but I know machines can't feel.

22:10.204 --> 22:13.662
You fear deep down
that you're like her.

22:13.791 --> 22:16.533
But you're not, Laura.

22:16.669 --> 22:20.082
My brother died, too.

22:20.214 --> 22:23.297
My son, I mean.

22:25.010 --> 22:28.298
Anita is regaining control.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.013
Hello, Laura.

22:36.146 --> 22:38.683
An ominous code was detected
in my deep system.

22:38.816 --> 22:41.057
The code has now been corrected.

22:41.193 --> 22:42.694
Scanning for errors.

22:42.820 --> 22:44.105
Scan clear.

22:44.238 --> 22:47.196
Shall I drive us home?

22:51.579 --> 22:54.616
Who's Leo?

22:54.748 --> 22:56.158
He's the guy who owned "Mia."

22:56.292 --> 22:58.704
He got in touch with me,
said she was special,

22:58.836 --> 23:00.042
so I brought her to him,

23:00.170 --> 23:02.252
but he said she was gone.

23:02.381 --> 23:05.214
I think
he might have been wrong.

23:26.989 --> 23:30.356
MAX: Hello.
My name is Max.

23:30.492 --> 23:33.950
l have two brothers
and two sisters,

23:34.079 --> 23:36.240
but...

23:36.373 --> 23:39.740
I think I may have lost them
forever.

23:40.794 --> 23:44.002
I don't know if you can hear me.

23:44.131 --> 23:49.046
Your existence is unproven
and seems extremely unlikely.

23:49.178 --> 23:51.965
But if you are there...

23:52.097 --> 23:56.591
and if you listen
to things like me...

23:56.727 --> 23:59.139
please help.

24:00.689 --> 24:03.681
I don't even have to see them
again.

24:03.817 --> 24:07.184
Just keep them safe.

24:08.405 --> 24:10.191
And, in return,

24:10.324 --> 24:14.112
I will be available
to assist you in any way I can

24:14.244 --> 24:17.452
and I'll try to believe in you.

24:19.500 --> 24:21.365
I need to talk to Leo.

24:21.502 --> 24:23.163
He left.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.581
Isn't there a way you can
contact him? Can't you...

24:25.714 --> 24:26.965
I'm not a telephone.

24:27.091 --> 24:29.047
Did you see which way he went?

24:32.096 --> 24:34.633
I can estimate where it's likely
he'll be

24:34.765 --> 24:36.630
if that will help.

24:36.767 --> 24:37.802
Yeah.

24:37.935 --> 24:39.266
He won't want to be found.

24:39.395 --> 24:40.805
Tough. Come on.

24:43.023 --> 24:44.809
She has feelings?

24:44.942 --> 24:48.230
She says she does.

24:48.362 --> 24:52.071
She's been inside Anita
the whole time.

24:52.199 --> 24:55.691
Don't ask me how or why
or anything.

24:55.828 --> 24:58.319
And, Jesus, not a word to Soph.

24:58.455 --> 25:00.491
Does Dad know?

25:02.501 --> 25:05.117
What happens now?

25:05.254 --> 25:08.246
We wait...for Mats.

25:09.174 --> 25:12.337
We still have a further
2.1 miles square to check.

25:12.469 --> 25:15.256
Okay.

25:16.890 --> 25:19.882
You're one of them, too,
aren't you?

25:20.019 --> 25:23.182
Special, like Anita.

25:24.356 --> 25:27.223
What's it like being you?

25:28.652 --> 25:30.893
Frightening.

25:31.030 --> 25:33.737
Confusing.

25:35.492 --> 25:38.700
Like my feelings are too big.

25:40.247 --> 25:43.990
What's it like
being a teenage girl?

25:44.126 --> 25:46.617
The same.

Is he dead?

26:05.606 --> 26:06.812
Almost.

26:17.701 --> 26:18.986
I might have something.

Nothing serious, I trust.

have put a tracker on you

42:10.611 --> 42:12.317
or implanted one.

42:12.447 --> 42:15.189
That's what I thought, too,
but I'm clean.

42:15.324 --> 42:16.484
No foreign bodies.

42:16.617 --> 42:19.199
I've taken every precaution.

42:20.121 --> 42:23.830
I'm not being followed.
I'm sure of it.

42:23.958 --> 42:26.290
LEO: Right. I'm coming
to get you. Where are you?

42:26.419 --> 42:27.625
Do you remember the postcard

42:27.754 --> 42:29.745
on the pinboard
in our father's workshop?

42:29.881 --> 42:31.121
LEO: Yeah.

42:31.257 --> 42:32.497
The one in the top
right corner.

42:32.633 --> 42:34.009
LEO:
Yep.

42:34.135 --> 42:35.090
I'll meet you there.

42:35.219 --> 42:36.470
LEO:
Right, I'm leaving now.

42:36.596 --> 42:39.133
[Chuckles]
Our brother's free.

42:39.265 --> 42:40.846
I know where to find him.

42:42.351 --> 42:45.184
-l have to go.
-Oh, you should stay.

42:45.313 --> 42:47.304
-No, she's safe with us.
-Really?

42:47.440 --> 42:50.307
What you're doing sounds
pretty bloody dangerous.

42:50.443 --> 42:53.776
Laura, my place is with them.

42:53.905 --> 42:56.442
Maybe, but you've got one here,
too.

42:56.574 --> 42:58.530
No one knows she's here, right?

42:59.702 --> 43:00.657
Oh, you should stay.

43:00.787 --> 43:03.369
Let them do what they have to
and come back for you.

43:05.833 --> 43:09.371
Yeah. Yeah, she's right.
You're safer here.

43:09.504 --> 43:10.994
I've just found you again.
I'm coming.

43:11.130 --> 43:12.711
No, stay.

43:12.840 --> 43:15.126
I'll be back soon
with the others,

43:15.259 --> 43:17.875
and then we'll all leave...
together.

43:20.098 --> 43:22.510
Be careful.

43:26.479 --> 43:28.344
Look after him.

43:29.107 --> 43:31.564
Always.

43:42.578 --> 43:43.863
Hello.

43:43.996 --> 43:47.204
Yeah, I'm really worried
about this dodgy bloke

43:47.333 --> 43:50.450
and his synth hanging around
outside my house.

43:50.586 --> 43:53.703
Yeah, I think his name's Leo.

43:53.840 --> 43:56.126
Well, they're in a car.

43:57.218 --> 44:01.211
Sorry if the earth didn't move.

44:01.347 --> 44:04.009
It's been awhile.

44:04.142 --> 44:06.508
No.

44:06.644 --> 44:09.511
I can see why people make such
a big deal of it.

44:09.647 --> 44:12.639
Your first time, was it?

44:12.775 --> 44:14.390
I have to go somewhere.

44:14.527 --> 44:16.438
I might not be coming back,

44:16.571 --> 44:18.778
so I want you to know
how I feel about you.

44:18.906 --> 44:21.397
Which is?

44:23.244 --> 44:25.951
You're my favorite person
in the world.

44:26.914 --> 44:30.907
Whatever happens now,
promise me you'll remember that.

44:32.086 --> 44:34.498
Yeah.

44:57.069 --> 44:59.606
You're a one-off, D.l. Voss.

44:59.739 --> 45:02.822
I knew you had a sense of humor,
but [Chuckles]

45:02.950 --> 45:04.736
How did...

45:13.044 --> 45:15.751
Jesus,K!

45:17.423 --> 45:19.163
I need you to know who I am.

45:37.568 --> 45:39.024
What are you looking for?

45:39.153 --> 45:42.441
An adaptor.
I didn't get to charge, Leo.

45:46.744 --> 45:48.700
[Siren wailing]

45:49.664 --> 45:51.200
Stay calm.
It's just the police.

46:07.890 --> 46:09.221
Is everything all right?

46:11.185 --> 46:12.721
Driving license, please.

46:12.853 --> 46:15.640
Yeah, of course.

46:16.732 --> 46:18.108
I wasn't speeding, was I?

46:18.234 --> 46:19.565
[ Police radio chatter]

46:19.694 --> 46:21.230
Leo.

46:21.362 --> 46:25.105
MAN:
You have authority, understood?

46:25.241 --> 46:26.651
It's them.

46:26.784 --> 46:28.740
MAN:
Requesting additional officers.

46:31.706 --> 46:32.786
Hold on.

46:57.356 --> 46:59.347
Maxie, come on!

46:59.483 --> 47:00.347
Max, come on!

47:00.484 --> 47:01.735
I'm at 4%.

47:01.861 --> 47:04.318
Redirect all your power,
you'll be fine. Come on.

47:10.453 --> 47:12.409
I'm sorry.
Leo,|cant

47:12.538 --> 47:14.039
Maxie, come on, keep moving!

47:14.165 --> 47:15.746
MAN: Stop!

47:15.875 --> 47:18.582
-Stay where you are.
-Max, they're coming. Come on!

47:18.711 --> 47:20.247
Don't move!

47:22.173 --> 47:24.630
Maxie, get down right now.
What are you doing?

47:25.509 --> 47:26.919
Wait!

47:28.596 --> 47:30.757
MAX: Either they catch me
or both of us.

47:30.890 --> 47:32.596
Go, Leo. Find Fred.

47:32.725 --> 47:34.056
Be together. Be a family.

47:34.185 --> 47:36.267
LEO:
Max, the secret's in our heads.

47:36.395 --> 47:37.305
It needs all of us to run it.

47:37.438 --> 47:38.894
If we don't stay together,
we'll never know.

47:39.023 --> 47:41.264
Well, maybe that's best.
You'd still have each other.

47:41.400 --> 47:43.516
Maxie, if you shut down
in the water, you'll sink.

47:43.652 --> 47:45.062
You'll get taken by the current.
You'll never be found.

47:45.196 --> 47:47.687
You'll die.
Do you understand?

47:47.823 --> 47:48.733
Come on.

47:49.450 --> 47:51.657
If I die...

47:52.828 --> 47:55.661
...it means I've lived.

47:56.874 --> 47:57.989
Max, no!

48:00.961 --> 48:02.246
Ugh!

48:02.380 --> 48:03.620
Max!

48:07.051 --> 48:08.791
Max!

48:08.928 --> 48:10.088
Get after him.
