00:05.176 --> 00:06.377
MARCO HERE CLAIMS
HE SET UP AN ACCOUNT

00:06.377 --> 00:08.309
THAT WAS MYSTERIOUSLY DRAINED

00:08.309 --> 00:10.381
A WEEK BEFORE NOLCORP
WENT PUBLIC.

00:10.381 --> 00:11.542
I'LL WRITE YOU A CHECK.

00:11.542 --> 00:13.214

00:13.214 --> 00:15.116
AND YOUR CONTINUED GOOD FAITH
AS ITS C.E.O.

00:15.116 --> 00:18.319
THE RYANS THINK YOUR DAD
KILLED THEIR OLD MAN.

00:18.319 --> 00:21.021
IS IT TRUE SOME OLD-TIMER
NEARLY BOUGHT IT OUT THERE?

00:21.021 --> 00:22.123
DANIEL.

 HEY.

00:23.424 --> 00:25.025
(Ashley) DANIEL, THIS ISN'T
WHAT YOU THINK IT IS.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.397
WHAT IS IT EXACTLY, HUH?
 NO!

00:26.397 --> 00:28.028
GET OFF ME. YOU DISGUST ME!
 HEY, THAT'S ENOUGH!

00:28.028 --> 00:30.201
WE NEED TO DISCUSS
YOUR SON'S FUTURE.

(Victoria) You so much as lay
a hand on my son,

00:31.732 --> 00:33.204
and I will kill you myself.

00:33.204 --> 00:35.236
SO IT'S OFFICIAL.
HE'S THE NEW C.E.O.

00:35.236 --> 00:36.567
THERE IS NO ROOM FOR YOU
ON THE BOARD

00:36.567 --> 00:38.069
UNLESS SOMEONE
WILLINGLY VACATES,

00:38.069 --> 00:41.112
AND I DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING
ANYTIME SOON.

00:41.112 --> 00:43.714
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT
A MATTER OF GRAVE IMPORTANCE.

00:43.714 --> 00:45.546
IT'S ABOUT DANIEL.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.378
(Emily) POWER...

00:47.378 --> 00:49.480
BORN OUT OF NATURE,

00:49.480 --> 00:52.183
COVETED BY MAN.

CAN NEVER BE LOST OR WON.

01:03.194 --> 01:05.296

WELL,
THAT'S AN ENCOURAGING SIGN

01:34.665 --> 01:36.767
GIVEN YOUR HARD-WON
NEW TITLE.

01:36.767 --> 01:38.469
BEING C.E.O.
OF A GLOBAL INVESTMENT FIRM

01:38.469 --> 01:41.172
ISN'T EXACTLY
A 9-TO-5 COMMITMENT.

COMES NATURALLY TO DANIEL.

DAD'S FRIEND IN THE HOSPITAL.

17:51.101 --> 17:52.702
WHICH IS WHY I NEED YOU
TO TAKE CARL

17:52.702 --> 17:54.204
AND GET OUT OF HERE TONIGHT.

17:54.204 --> 17:55.575
JACK, WE'RE A FAMILY.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.577
I'M NOT GONNA LEAVE YOU HERE
TO FEND FOR YOURSELF.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.579
I WON'T BE. I REACHED OUT
TO MY BUDDY ON THE FORCE.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.080
OH--
 HE'S GONNA BUST 'EM.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.752
LOOK, THEY'LL NEVER KNOW
I WAS INVOLVED.
 (sighs)

18:02.752 --> 18:05.455
I KNOW IT'S NOT YOUR STYLE
TO RUN AWAY FROM A FIGHT.

18:05.455 --> 18:07.187
BUT I INVITED THESE PEOPLE
INTO OUR LIVES.

18:07.187 --> 18:09.119
I NEED YOU TO TRUST ME
TO TAKE THEM OUT.

18:09.119 --> 18:11.121
I DO TRUST YOU.
 OKAY.

18:11.121 --> 18:13.193
I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW MUCH I HATE THIS.

18:13.193 --> 18:14.424
I KNOW.

18:14.424 --> 18:16.726
ME, TOO.

18:16.726 --> 18:18.768
(whispers) I LOVE YOU.

18:21.301 --> 18:24.204
PRINCE OEDIPUS
JUST GRANTED ME ACCESS

18:24.204 --> 18:28.278
TO THE GRAYSON GLOBAL INTRANET
TO SNOOP FOR HIM.

18:28.278 --> 18:30.280
IT COULD PROVIDE
THE ACCESS WE NEED

18:30.280 --> 18:31.611
TO UNEARTH THE INITIATIVE.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.313
WELL, THAT'S GREAT NEWS.

18:33.313 --> 18:35.785
WELL, LEMONS TO LEMONADE.
OHH.

18:35.785 --> 18:38.188
B.T. DUBS, I WAS SO SORRY
TO HEAR ABOUT YOUR BREAKUP

18:38.188 --> 18:39.719
WITH REMINGTON STEELE.

18:39.719 --> 18:42.121
THOUGH THERE REALLY WASN'T
ENOUGH ROOM IN YOUR SIDECAR

18:42.121 --> 18:44.494
FOR BOTH OF US.
 HELLO, NOLAN.

18:44.494 --> 18:47.597
(gasps) HEY, BUDDY. MM.

18:47.597 --> 18:49.399
WHAT? WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WAIT.

18:49.399 --> 18:51.401
YOU TWO...

18:51.401 --> 18:54.133
(sighs) A FAKE UP?

18:54.133 --> 18:56.466
COLOR ME IMPRESSED.

18:56.466 --> 18:57.767
IF I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER,
I'D SAY

18:57.767 --> 18:59.809
DANIEL'S ALREADY THINKING...
(singsongy) MAKE UP.

18:59.809 --> 19:01.211
THAT'S THE IDEA.

19:01.211 --> 19:02.572
FOR NOW.

19:02.572 --> 19:03.873
I STILL THINK I CAN WIN BACK
DANIEL'S CONFIDENCE.

19:03.873 --> 19:06.316
WELL, BROS BEFORE HOS
ONLY WORKS

19:06.316 --> 19:08.818
IF HE'S NOT STILL IN LOVE
WITH THE HO, BRO.

19:08.818 --> 19:11.351
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH LOVE, NOLAN.

19:11.351 --> 19:12.782
I HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY
TO EXPOSE JUDGE BARNES

19:12.782 --> 19:14.824
FOR HIS PART
IN MY FATHER'S CONVICTION.

19:14.824 --> 19:17.687
IF I HAVE TO PLAY NICE
WITH DANIEL FOR A LITTLE WHILE,

19:17.687 --> 19:20.430
THEN...
IT'S A SMALL PRICE TO PAY.

19:20.430 --> 19:21.591
(clears throat)

19:21.591 --> 19:23.363
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.
 YEAH.

19:23.363 --> 19:24.694
MM.

19:26.436 --> 19:28.868
(door opens)
 HMM. COULD GET TRICKY.

19:28.868 --> 19:31.671
IF MEMORY SERVES,
THE LINE BETWEEN...

19:31.671 --> 19:34.344
(door closes)
 EMILY AND DANIEL
AND THE INITIATIVE

19:34.344 --> 19:36.746
HAS ALWAYS BEEN
DECIDEDLY BLURRED.

19:36.746 --> 19:39.249
THEN YOU DO ME A FAVOR.
 HMM?

19:39.249 --> 19:40.580
HELP ME STAY
ONE STEP AHEAD OF THE BOY.

19:40.580 --> 19:42.712
ANY INFORMATION ABOUT
THE INITIATIVE YOU UNCOVER,

19:42.712 --> 19:44.684
IN PARTICULAR A WOMAN
BY THE NAME OF HELEN CROWLEY,

19:44.684 --> 19:46.716
YOU LET ME KNOW FIRST.

19:46.716 --> 19:50.220
SURE.

19:50.220 --> 19:52.562
GREG, WE'RE HAPPY TO BE
A PART OF YOUR SUCCESS, RIGHT?

19:52.562 --> 19:53.693
AND LONG MAY IT CONTINUE.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.295
HELLO, DANIEL.

19:55.295 --> 19:56.696
OH, FORGIVE ME
FOR INTERRUPTING.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.768
(lowered voice) INTERRUPTING
IS THE LEAST OF YOUR OFFENSES.

19:58.768 --> 19:59.929
(normal voice)
GREG, I'LL CALL YOU BACK.

19:59.929 --> 20:01.301
IT'S TIME WE MEND FENCES.

20:01.301 --> 20:02.472
AND I'VE COME TO OFFER YOU
MY SERVICES.

20:02.472 --> 20:03.703
YOUR SERVICES
AREN'T REQUIRED.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.235
BUT IF I EVER NEED ADVICE
ON BETRAYAL,

20:05.235 --> 20:06.736
I'LL BE SURE
TO GIVE YOU A CALL...

20:06.736 --> 20:08.378
AFTER DAD.

20:08.378 --> 20:10.680
WELL, HE DOES HAVE
HIS CONSIDERABLE SHORTCOMINGS.

20:10.680 --> 20:11.981
BUT HE DID TAKE THIS FIRM

20:11.981 --> 20:13.983
FROM A BUDDING HEDGE FUND
TO A PILLAR OF WALL STREET,

20:13.983 --> 20:15.685
AND HE DIDN'T DO IT ALONE.

20:15.685 --> 20:17.517
ARE YOU REALLY PATTING YOURSELF
ON THE BACK RIGHT NOW?

20:17.517 --> 20:19.819
I'M SIMPLY GIVING CREDIT
WHERE CREDIT'S DUE.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.821
WHERE DO YOU THINK YOUR FATHER
BROKERED HIS BIGGEST DEALS,

20:21.821 --> 20:22.952
IN THIS OFFICE

20:22.952 --> 20:25.355
OR OVER COCKTAILS
AT POLO MATCHES

20:25.355 --> 20:27.226
AND GALAS THAT I HOSTED?

20:27.226 --> 20:28.898
WHAT ARE YOU OFFERING
TO DO MOM, THROW ME A PARTY?

20:28.898 --> 20:30.730
WELL, THERE IS
A DINNER TONIGHT.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.231
AND THE NEXT U.S.
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE

20:32.231 --> 20:33.663
WILL BE IN ATTENDANCE.

20:33.663 --> 20:34.964
AND IF YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT
YOUR LONG-TERM SUCCESS,

20:34.964 --> 20:36.566
SO WILL YOU.

20:38.268 --> 20:39.869
OH.

20:39.869 --> 20:41.711
UM...

20:41.711 --> 20:43.713
EMILY THORNE JUST BECAME
A MAJOR DONOR

20:43.713 --> 20:45.615
FOR PATRICIA BARNES'
PET CHARITY.

20:47.817 --> 20:49.449
SHE'LL BE THERE AS WELL,

20:49.449 --> 20:51.881
IF THAT HELPS SWAY
YOUR DECISION.

20:54.824 --> 20:56.356
(typing)

20:56.356 --> 20:57.787
(beep)

20:57.787 --> 21:00.930
(resumes typing)

21:00.930 --> 21:03.763
YOU TRYING TO HACK INTO
GRAYSON GLOBAL'S INTRANET?

21:03.763 --> 21:05.935
NOT THAT IT IS
 ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS,

21:05.935 --> 21:08.998
BUT I AM FOLLOWING THE ORDERS
OF MY CHILD BOSS--

21:08.998 --> 21:10.540
YOUR PAL DANIEL.

21:10.540 --> 21:12.642
YOU REALLY EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE
THAT GRAYSON ASKED YOU

21:12.642 --> 21:14.404
TO HACK INTO
HIS OWN COMPANY'S FILES?

21:14.404 --> 21:16.446
I DON'T REALLY CARE
WHAT YOU BELIEVE, MARCO.

21:16.446 --> 21:17.847
I AM NOT THE BAD GUY HERE.

21:17.847 --> 21:20.380
BUT IF YOU KEEP SIDING
WITH DANIEL GRAYSON,

21:20.380 --> 21:22.852
THE ONLY BAD GUY HERE
IS YOU.

21:22.852 --> 21:25.985
NOLAN, LOOK, WE HAVE TO STOP
DOING THIS TO EACH OTHER.

21:27.587 --> 21:29.018
LET'S GO GET SOME DRINKS.

21:29.018 --> 21:31.361
(sighs) SORRY.

21:31.361 --> 21:33.062
YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE.
 (resumes typing)

21:33.062 --> 21:34.424
(computer beeps)

21:34.424 --> 21:38.768
AHH. (chuckles)
AND I'M IN.

21:38.768 --> 21:40.930
GOOD NIGHT, MARCO.

21:40.930 --> 21:43.933
(resumes typing)

21:46.836 --> 21:49.909
(doorbell rings)

21:49.909 --> 21:51.611
THANK YOU.
 GOOD EVENING, MS. THORNE.

21:51.611 --> 21:54.914
EMILY, YOU LOOK TERRIFIC
AS ALWAYS.

21:54.914 --> 21:57.016
THANK YOU.

21:57.016 --> 21:59.719
(sighs) I HOPE
THIS ISN'T TOO AWKWARD.

21:59.719 --> 22:01.891
ARE YOU OKAY...

22:01.891 --> 22:04.093
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED TODAY
AT LUNCH WITH YOU AND AIDEN?

22:04.093 --> 22:06.526
YEAH.

22:06.526 --> 22:07.927
YEAH. A-AIDEN'S A GOOD GUY.

22:07.927 --> 22:10.099
HE'S SMART. HE'S... DRIVEN.

22:10.099 --> 22:12.101
BUT... I DON'T KNOW.

22:12.101 --> 22:13.933
MAYBE HE'S JUST NOT
FOR ME.

22:13.933 --> 22:16.966
WELL, AT LEAST YOU FOUND OUT
BEFORE IT GOT TOO SERIOUS.

22:16.966 --> 22:19.539
LUCKILY, THE SAME CAN BE SAID
FOR ME AND ASHLEY.

22:19.539 --> 22:21.611
EMILY.
OH, YOU'RE JUST ON TIME.

22:21.611 --> 22:23.843
COME JOIN US.

22:24.974 --> 22:26.576
SHALL WE?

22:28.878 --> 22:30.680
(flame whooshes)

22:30.680 --> 22:32.822
I ACTUALLY AUDITED
A TORTS CLASS

22:32.822 --> 22:34.854
WHEN I WAS CONSIDERING
LAW SCHOOLS IN UNDERGRAD

22:34.854 --> 22:37.787
BACK IN... 2002.

22:37.787 --> 22:38.888
REALLY?
 MM.

22:38.888 --> 22:40.590
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

22:40.590 --> 22:42.532
DANIEL, IT SEEMS
THAT YOUR TENDENCY

22:42.532 --> 22:45.565
TO OVERLOOK CRITICAL DETAIL IS
NOT JUST EXCLUSIVE TO BUSINESS.

22:45.565 --> 22:48.037
MM. THE OCCASIONAL OVERSIGHT
IS FAR LESS DAMAGING

22:48.037 --> 22:49.539
THAN WILLFUL IGNORANCE.

22:49.539 --> 22:51.841
OH, ENOUGH, YOU TWO.
WE HAVE GUESTS. (laughs)

22:51.841 --> 22:52.972
OH, A LITTLE COMPETITION

22:52.972 --> 22:54.674
BETWEEN MEN IS HEALTHY,
VICTORIA.

22:54.674 --> 22:57.977
AFTER ALL, IT'S THE FOUNDATION
OF OUR GREAT NATION, HUH?

22:57.977 --> 22:58.948
(laughs)

22:58.948 --> 23:00.750
(Emily) THAT'S WHAT
MY PROFESSOR SAID.

23:00.750 --> 23:03.483
IN FACT, JUDGE BARNES,
I BELIEVE YOU KNEW HIM.

23:03.483 --> 23:06.486
UM, JAMES PALMER.

23:06.486 --> 23:08.157
YES. YES, OF COURSE
I KNEW JAMES.

23:08.157 --> 23:10.059
HE WAS A CLERK
IN MY COURT FOR A TIME.

23:10.059 --> 23:15.094
MM. HIS ACCIDENT THAT WINTER
SHOOK UP THE ENTIRE CAMPUS.

23:15.094 --> 23:17.967
WELL, HE WAS A GOOD MAN.

23:17.967 --> 23:20.900
HIS PASSION FOR JUSTICE
WAS UNPARALLELED.

23:22.502 --> 23:24.704
PATRICIA,
YOU KNEW HIM, TOO?

23:27.777 --> 23:29.408
ONLY IN LEGACY.

23:30.640 --> 23:32.612
WHICH, IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN,

23:32.612 --> 23:34.614
INCLUDES THE INFAMOUS
DAVID CLARKE TRIAL.

23:34.614 --> 23:37.086
I OWN THE MAN'S HOUSE.

23:37.086 --> 23:40.189
CONSPIRACY THEORISTS SHOW UP
ON MY DOORSTEP ALL THE TIME.

23:40.189 --> 23:42.922
TO SAY NOTHING OF
DAVID'S OWN DAUGHTER AMANDA.

23:42.922 --> 23:45.154
SHE AND EMILY HAVE BECOME
QUITE FRIENDLY LATELY.

23:45.154 --> 23:47.697
WELL, NO DISRESPECT
TO YOUR FRIEND, MS. THORNE,

23:47.697 --> 23:50.159
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THAT
CONTEMPTIBLE FATHER OF HERS,

23:50.159 --> 23:53.162
BELIEVE ME,
JUSTICE WAS WELL SERVED.

23:53.162 --> 23:57.066
SOUNDS LIKE YOUR CERTAINTY
GIVES YOU GREAT COMFORT.

23:57.066 --> 23:59.909
I HAVEN'T LOST A NIGHT
OF SLEEP OVER THE MAN,

23:59.909 --> 24:01.941
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE ASKING.

24:01.941 --> 24:03.112
MM.

24:03.112 --> 24:04.614
NO, THAT WOULD BE MY JOB.

24:04.614 --> 24:05.875
(laughs)

24:05.875 --> 24:08.017
(laughs)

24:10.780 --> 24:14.053
BUT, PATRICIA, SURELY
THE LIBERTY PROJECT

24:14.053 --> 24:16.626
HAS BEEN APPROACHED
COUNTLESS TIMES ABOUT AN APPEAL.

24:16.626 --> 24:18.027
NO.

24:18.027 --> 24:19.959
ACTUALLY, IT HASN'T.

24:19.959 --> 24:22.932
NONE OF MY HUSBAND'S VERDICTS
HAVE EVER BEEN SECOND-GUESSED

24:22.932 --> 24:24.694
BY THE ORGANIZATION.

24:26.065 --> 24:30.039
HIS OPINIONS
ARE ABOVE REPROACH.

24:30.039 --> 24:32.772
(Conrad) HENCE
THE SUPREME COURT NOMINATION.

24:32.772 --> 24:34.103
HEAR, HEAR.

24:35.244 --> 24:36.746
VICTORIA,

24:36.746 --> 24:38.047
THANK YOU
FOR THE LOVELY DINNER.

24:38.047 --> 24:39.809
BUT THERE'S MUCH WORK
TO BE DONE

24:39.809 --> 24:41.050
BEFORE TOMORROW'S BENEFIT.

24:41.050 --> 24:42.752
I'M COMING DOWN
WITH A BIT OF A HEADACHE.

24:42.752 --> 24:44.053
OH, I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

24:44.053 --> 24:45.785
SHOULD I HAVE SOMETHING
SENT TO YOU?

24:45.785 --> 24:46.956
THANK YOU.

24:46.956 --> 24:49.789
I THINK I'LL JOIN YOU, DARLING.

24:49.789 --> 24:51.090
GOOD NIGHT, ALL.

24:51.090 --> 24:54.093
PLEASURE, DANIEL, MS. THORNE.

25:03.202 --> 25:04.233
SORRY FOR DROPPING IN
ON YOU LIKE THIS.

25:04.233 --> 25:05.935
THE STOWAWAY'S BEEN ROWDY.

25:05.935 --> 25:09.679
CARL HASN'T BEEN SLEEPING,
SO I HAVEN'T BEEN SLEEPING.

25:09.679 --> 25:11.981
YOU CAN STAY
AS LONG AS YOU NEED.

25:11.981 --> 25:16.215
"BROKEN COLLAR BONE,
FRACTURED WRIST"?

25:16.215 --> 25:18.588
WHOSE RECORDS ARE THESE?

25:18.588 --> 25:19.749
(clicks key)

25:19.749 --> 25:21.120
PATRICIA BARNES.

25:21.120 --> 25:24.253
SHE'S THE WIFE OF THE JUDGE
IN MY FATHER'S TRIAL.

25:27.256 --> 25:29.929
"DEAR MR. CLARKE"...
DID SHE WRITE THIS?

25:29.929 --> 25:32.602
I'M BEGINNING TO WONDER.

25:32.602 --> 25:33.863
(typing)

25:33.863 --> 25:36.165
IT SAYS HERE, SHE HAD
A CRIMINAL RECORD.

25:36.165 --> 25:39.168
(chuckles)
JOIN THE CLUB.

25:39.168 --> 25:40.740
HER JUDGMENT WAS EXPUNGED,

25:40.740 --> 25:43.072
JUST LIKE MINE.

25:43.072 --> 25:46.746
THERE MUST BE
SOMETHING HERE.

25:46.746 --> 25:49.218
APARTHEID PROTEST, 1988.

25:49.218 --> 25:51.320
PATRICIA WAS A BADASS.

25:51.320 --> 25:53.122
MAYBE BACK THEN.

25:54.323 --> 25:55.785
WAIT.

25:55.785 --> 25:57.627
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

25:57.627 --> 25:59.158
THAT'S JAMES PALMER
NEXT TO HER.

25:59.158 --> 26:00.960
WHO?

26:00.960 --> 26:02.261
BARNES' COURT CLERK.

26:02.261 --> 26:04.734
HE AND PATRICIA
WERE FRIENDS.

26:04.734 --> 26:06.235
WHICH MEANS, IF SHE DID
WRITE THE LETTER,

26:06.235 --> 26:08.067
WHOEVER KILLED PALMER
BELIEVED HE WROTE IT,

26:08.067 --> 26:10.269
NOT HER.

26:10.269 --> 26:13.773
THAT WOULD SCARE
ANYONE INTO SILENCE.

26:13.773 --> 26:17.947
ESPECIALLY IF THE THREAT
LIVES UNDER THE SAME ROOF.

26:17.947 --> 26:19.879
WELL, SINCE YOU'VE ALREADY
MASTERED THE LINKS, GRAYSON,

26:19.879 --> 26:21.881
HOW DO YOU PLAN TO SPEND
THE REST OF YOUR RETIREMENT?

26:21.881 --> 26:24.353
(laughs) RETIREMENT
IS A LONG WAY OFF, ROBERT.

26:24.353 --> 26:26.786
THIS IS BUT A RESPITE FROM
MY STEWARDSHIP OF THE COMPANY.

26:26.786 --> 26:28.217
WELL, IT'S JUST
ONE MAN'S OPINION,

26:28.217 --> 26:30.890
BUT I THINK A MAN OF YOUR
ACUMEN, WEALTH, AND GUILE

26:30.890 --> 26:32.221
BELONGS IN POLITICS.

26:32.221 --> 26:34.323
OH, DON'T GO PUTTING IDEAS
IN HIS HEAD, ROBERT.

26:34.323 --> 26:36.065
IT'S THE LAST THING
THIS FAMILY NEEDS.

26:36.065 --> 26:41.070

36:34.793 --> 36:37.866
THREE DAYS BEFORE HIS DEATH...

36:37.866 --> 36:39.728
THAT SECRET CAME OUT
IN A LETTER

36:39.728 --> 36:41.870
WRITTEN TO MR. CLARKE
IN FEDERAL PRISON.

36:41.870 --> 36:44.473
"DEAR MR. CLARKE,

36:44.473 --> 36:46.705
I'M AFRAID YOU HAVE SUFFERED
A GRAVE INJUSTICE."

36:46.705 --> 36:48.307
PATRICIA.

36:48.307 --> 36:50.239
ROBERT.
 (camera shutter clicks)

36:50.239 --> 36:53.242
(guests murmuring)

36:57.816 --> 36:59.448
(camera shutter clicking)

36:59.448 --> 37:01.920
"MY POSITION HAS PROVIDED ME

37:01.920 --> 37:04.423
"UNPARALLELED ACCESS
TO THE SYSTEM.

37:04.423 --> 37:07.856
JUDGE BARNES HAS FAILED YOU,
MR. CLARKE, AS HAVE I."

37:07.856 --> 37:10.599
YOU SEE, WHAT JAMES KNEW

37:10.599 --> 37:12.461
IS WHAT JUDGE BARNES KNEW,

37:12.461 --> 37:14.263
WHICH IS THAT
THE VERDICT RENDERED

37:14.263 --> 37:17.235
IN THE DAVID CLARKE TRIAL
CAME FROM A TAINTED JURY.

37:17.235 --> 37:18.737
(guests murmuring)

37:18.737 --> 37:22.811
I BELIEVE THAT THIS LETTER
COST JAMES THE ULTIMATE PRICE.

37:22.811 --> 37:25.013
BUT JAMES DIDN'T WRITE IT.

37:25.013 --> 37:26.915
I DID.

37:26.915 --> 37:29.247
(guests gasping and murmuring)

37:29.247 --> 37:32.951
AND TODAY MY HUSBAND,
ROBERT BARNES,

37:32.951 --> 37:36.685
STANDS TO INHERIT
A GREAT DEAL MORE POWER.

37:36.685 --> 37:38.957
AND...

37:38.957 --> 37:40.989
THE GREATER THE POWER,

37:40.989 --> 37:44.393
THE GREATER THE POTENTIAL
FOR ABUSE.

37:45.764 --> 37:47.035
(guests gasping and murmuring)

37:47.035 --> 37:50.599
(camera shutters clicking)

37:51.840 --> 37:54.873
(murmuring continues)

38:01.980 --> 38:05.484
(clicking continues)

38:10.288 --> 38:11.390
MY WIFE AND I ARE SHOCKED

38:11.390 --> 38:12.561
TO LEARN THE TRUE NATURE
OF A MAN

38:12.561 --> 38:13.522
WE ALL THOUGHT WE KNEW,

38:13.522 --> 38:14.893
AND I PLEDGE
TO POOL MY RESOURCES

38:14.893 --> 38:17.596
TO ENSURE
JUDGE BARNES' WRONGDOINGS,

38:17.596 --> 38:20.399
BOTH JUDICIAL AND DOMESTIC,
ARE AVENGED.

38:20.399 --> 38:21.800
REST ASSURED,

38:21.800 --> 38:23.802
JUSTICE WILL BE SERVED.

38:23.802 --> 38:25.604
THANK YOU.
 (reporters speaking at once)

38:25.604 --> 38:27.305
(cell phone rings, beep)

38:27.305 --> 38:28.507
HELLO.

38:28.507 --> 38:29.838
(Helen) Hello, Daniel.

38:29.838 --> 38:31.380
I saw you and your family

38:31.380 --> 38:33.442
had another
interesting public evening.

38:33.442 --> 38:34.683
WELL, EXCEPT THIS TIME,

38:34.683 --> 38:37.486
THE PRESS MAY ACTUALLY WORK
IN MY FATHER'S FAVOR.

38:37.486 --> 38:39.047
HOW ARE YOU FARING
IN YOUR HUNT

38:39.047 --> 38:40.719
FOR THOSE
ELUSIVE GRAYSON ASSETS?

38:40.719 --> 38:42.521
If I didn't know better,

38:42.521 --> 38:44.823
I'D SAY YOU SENT ME
ON A WILD GOOSE CHASE.

38:44.823 --> 38:46.825
YOU TURNED TO NOLAN ROSS
FOR HIS ASSISTANCE,

38:46.825 --> 38:48.527
am I correct?

38:49.698 --> 38:50.859
YEAH.

38:50.859 --> 38:52.831
In doing so,
Mr. Ross left a trail

38:52.831 --> 38:54.403
of digital breadcrumbs,

38:54.403 --> 38:56.104
a trail your I.T. department

38:56.104 --> 38:57.406
WILL BE ABLE TO FOLLOW

38:57.406 --> 39:00.369
RIGHT BACK TO NOLCORP
AND ITS SECRETS.

39:00.369 --> 39:05.674
One in particular, I think
you'll find very lucrative.

39:05.674 --> 39:08.116
I'M LISTENING.

39:12.581 --> 39:14.082
CHARLOTTE GET HOME
ALL RIGHT?

39:14.082 --> 39:15.854
YEAH.

39:15.854 --> 39:18.487
YEAH, NOT WITHOUT A LOT
OF EXPLANATION, THOUGH.

39:18.487 --> 39:20.489
SHE DESERVES IT
AFTER A NIGHT LIKE THIS--

39:20.489 --> 39:23.091
YOUR BOAT IMPOUNDED,
YOUR BROTHER ARRESTED.

39:23.091 --> 39:24.563
(chair scrapes floor)

39:24.563 --> 39:25.964
(sighs) JACK'S A GOOD GUY,
TAKING THE FALL.

39:25.964 --> 39:28.066
KENNY, YOU KNOW
THAT WASN'T OUR STUFF.

39:28.066 --> 39:30.399
(sighs)

39:30.399 --> 39:32.641
I'M SORRY FOR WHAT HAPPENED.

39:32.641 --> 39:34.703
TRULY.

39:34.703 --> 39:36.605
HEY, WHOEVER CALLED
THE COPS TODAY

39:36.605 --> 39:39.448
MADE A HUGE MISTAKE.

39:39.448 --> 39:40.609
(door closes)

39:40.609 --> 39:42.110
I JUST HOPE THAT THEY COME
TO THEIR SENSES,

39:42.110 --> 39:43.782
OR THINGS MIGHT GET WORSE
AROUND HERE.

39:43.782 --> 39:45.514
A LOT WORSE.

39:45.514 --> 39:47.416
KENNY, YOU COMING?

39:50.819 --> 39:52.661
OH, UH,
DECLAN, BE A PAL, HUH?

39:52.661 --> 39:54.663
CLEAN UP A LITTLE BIT.

39:59.067 --> 40:00.569
(phone rings)

40:00.569 --> 40:02.000
(line clicks)
 (Amanda) Hello.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.803
AMANDA. UH, HEY, IT'S ME.

40:04.803 --> 40:06.905
JACK, YOU OKAY? WHAT HAPPENED.
 The police found

40:06.905 --> 40:09.708
DRUGS AND A GUN
ON THE "AMANDA."

40:09.708 --> 40:10.679
I'm in jail.

40:10.679 --> 40:12.040
JACK, OH, MY GOD.
 (crying)

40:12.040 --> 40:14.182
Don't--don't worry.
I don't want you to worry.

40:14.182 --> 40:15.844
Everything's gonna be okay.

40:15.844 --> 40:19.918
(crying continues)

40:21.790 --> 40:23.722
I GOTTA GO.
 TIME'S UP, MAN.

40:23.722 --> 40:25.053
(crying continues)

40:25.053 --> 40:27.556
I LOVE YOU.
 COME ON. LET'S GO.

40:27.556 --> 40:30.659
(crying continues)

40:30.659 --> 40:32.130
(continues crying)
 (beep)

40:32.130 --> 40:34.503
(wailing)

40:34.503 --> 40:37.606
POWER CAN BE HOARDED
BY THE MIGHTY

40:37.606 --> 40:41.470
OR STOLEN FROM THE INNOCENT.

40:41.470 --> 40:43.572
(Aiden) EMS,
I'M GONNA TAKE A SHOWER.

40:43.572 --> 40:45.143
OKAY.

40:49.678 --> 40:53.852
POWER PROVIDES
THE ABILITY TO CHOOSE...

40:53.852 --> 40:56.685
(rustles paper)

41:00.929 --> 41:04.533
BUT HAS A PROCLIVITY
FOR CORRUPTION.

41:05.764 --> 41:07.095
DANIEL.

41:07.095 --> 41:09.167
HEY. DO YOU HAVE A SECOND?

41:10.539 --> 41:11.770
YEAH.

41:11.770 --> 41:14.973
SORRY TO STOP BY
UNANNOUNCED.

41:14.973 --> 41:16.745
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

41:16.745 --> 41:17.906
YEAH. I JUST--

41:17.906 --> 41:19.247
I TRIED TO
TELL YOU THIS EARLIER,

41:19.247 --> 41:21.049
BUT OF COURSE
MY MOTHER INTERRUPTED.

41:21.049 --> 41:22.611
IT'S WHAT SHE DOES.

41:22.611 --> 41:24.613
MM.

41:24.613 --> 41:25.754
I WANTED YOU TO KNOW,

41:25.754 --> 41:27.756
THE REASON I FOUGHT SO HARD
TO BECOME C.E.O.

41:27.756 --> 41:30.719
WAS TO SET THINGS RIGHT.

41:30.719 --> 41:32.721
YOU SEE,
THE ONLY THING LARGER

41:32.721 --> 41:34.262
THAN OUR COMPANY'S
IMAGE PROBLEM

41:34.262 --> 41:37.065
IS OUR CHARITABLE FOUNDATION.

41:37.065 --> 41:40.268
EMILY, YOU'RE THE MOST
PHILANTHROPIC PERSON I KNOW,

41:40.268 --> 41:42.030
AND I COULD REALLY USE
YOUR HELP

41:42.030 --> 41:45.003
STEERING OUR RESOURCES
IN THAT DIRECTION.

41:45.003 --> 41:46.835
W-WELL, I'M FLATTERED, BUT--

41:46.835 --> 41:48.707
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER NOW.
JUST...

41:48.707 --> 41:50.679
JUST TELL ME
YOU'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

41:56.915 --> 41:59.788
OKAY.

41:59.788 --> 42:00.749
DANIEL.

42:02.721 --> 42:06.755
I DON'T NEED
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

42:06.755 --> 42:09.658
MY ANSWER'S "YES."

42:16.865 --> 42:20.008
THE USE OF POWER IS NOT
TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY...

42:24.012 --> 42:27.576
FOR IT IS NEVER
WITHOUT CONSEQUENCE.
