09:59.532 --> 10:00.600
ONE THING THAT EVERYBODY

10:00.600 --> 10:01.835
NEEDS TO KNOW ABOUT ME IS,

10:01.835 --> 10:04.071
WHEN I LOVE, I GO HARD.

10:04.071 --> 10:05.639
AT ONE POINT, I WENT

10:05.639 --> 10:07.074
DEFINITELY HARD FOR SCRAPPY.

10:07.074 --> 10:08.175
HE WAS MY BEST FRIEND,

10:08.175 --> 10:09.409

10:09.409 --> 10:10.577
HE WAS MY EVERYTHING.

10:10.577 --> 10:11.912

10:13.180 --> 10:14.414
AND CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT

WAS GOING ON.

10:15.382 --> 10:16.383
I DECIDED TO VISIT THE ONE

10:18.118 --> 10:21.154
SOME LIGHT ON THIS SITUATION.

10:21.154 --> 10:21.889
I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND

10:21.889 --> 10:23.623
WHERE THIS PROPOSAL CAME FROM.

10:23.623 --> 10:24.792
I NEVER DID NOTHING TO DECEIVE

10:29.129 --> 10:30.330

DID YOU KNOW?

10:34.134 --> 10:35.102
NO, I DIDN'T.

10:35.102 --> 10:35.969
DID HE TELL YOU?

10:35.969 --> 10:36.837
DID HE ASK YOU?

10:36.837 --> 10:37.871
DID HE SAY ANYTHING?

10:37.871 --> 10:39.740
NO, IT WAS A SURPRISE TO ME.

10:39.740 --> 10:40.507

10:42.710 --> 10:45.478

10:55.622 --> 10:57.624
ARE NOT A GOOD COMBINATION.

13:08.421 --> 13:09.122
I'MA STOP YOU.

13:09.122 --> 13:09.857
NO, I GOT TO STOP YOU.

13:09.857 --> 13:11.424

YOU GOT TO REPAIR THAT.

13:23.203 --> 13:24.404
I KNOW.

13:24.404 --> 13:25.873
THE SAME THING THAT MAKES ME

13:25.873 --> 13:28.375
A GREAT ARTIST IS THE SAME THING

13:28.375 --> 13:30.510
THAT CAN DESTROY ME.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.645
I WEAR MY EMOTIONS ON MY SLEEVE.

13:32.645 --> 13:33.746
IT TAKES A SPECIAL KIND

13:33.746 --> 13:35.082
OF PERSON TO BE MY FRIEND,

13:35.082 --> 13:36.249
IT TAKES A SPECIAL KIND OF MAN

13:36.249 --> 13:37.184
TO LOVE ME, AND IT TAKES

13:37.184 --> 13:38.151
A SPECIAL KIND OF PERSON

13:38.151 --> 13:39.586
TO DO BUSINESS WITH ME.

13:39.586 --> 13:41.221
I'M NOT THE GIRLY R&B ARTIST.

13:46.493 --> 13:47.895

13:49.897 --> 13:52.065
I NEED TO DO ALL OF THIS,

13:52.065 --> 13:55.335
AND I NEED TO, MOST IMPORTANTLY,

13:55.335 --> 13:57.570
GIVE WOMEN A VOICE.

13:57.570 --> 13:58.505
ALL I'M SAYING TO YOU:

13:58.505 --> 13:59.272

14:10.918 --> 14:12.319
PEACE, KILL YOURSELF.

14:12.319 --> 14:14.254
DRINK BLEACH TWICE

14:14.254 --> 14:16.589
BECAUSE, REGARDS ANYTHING,

14:16.589 --> 14:19.159
I AM GENUINE IN MY MUSIC

14:19.159 --> 14:20.627
AND I'M GENUINE WITH MY FANS,

14:20.627 --> 14:22.695
AND THEY WANT ME TO WIN.

14:22.695 --> 14:23.430

14:37.010 --> 14:38.078
YES, IT DOES.

14:38.078 --> 14:39.179
IT FEELS REAL.

14:39.179 --> 14:39.947
LAST YEAR, WHEN ME AND

14:39.947 --> 14:40.780
AND SCRAPPY WERE GOING

14:40.780 --> 14:41.614
THROUGH OUR UPS AND DOWNS,

14:41.614 --> 14:42.983
I TOLD MY MOM THAT I WAS GONNA

14:42.983 --> 14:43.783
HAVE A RING.

14:43.783 --> 14:44.584
AND I KNOW SHE STILL HAS HER

14:44.584 --> 14:46.119
DOUBTS, SO I DECIDED TO PROVE

15:00.700 --> 15:04.004
I FEE LIKE HE IS VERY SINCERE.

15:04.004 --> 15:04.837

15:46.279 --> 15:48.215
I KNOW HE LOVES YOU.

15:48.215 --> 15:49.249

15:49.249 --> 15:51.251
TO REALLY MARRY YOU?

15:51.251 --> 15:52.219
NOTHING'S EVER ENOUGH FOR

15:52.219 --> 15:53.820
HER, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES

15:53.820 --> 15:54.787

31:41.167 --> 31:42.969
AND NOT WITH THE FRIEND.

31:42.969 --> 31:44.836
IF YOU MY MAMA AND I'M YOUR SON,

31:44.836 --> 31:46.605
AND I'M GOING TO THE LEFT,

31:46.605 --> 31:47.406
I THINK YOU SHOULD FOLLOW ME

31:47.406 --> 31:48.140
LEFT.

31:48.140 --> 31:49.541
I MEAN, I'LL DO THAT,

31:49.541 --> 31:51.343
BUT THEN, I LIKE SHAY.

31:51.343 --> 31:52.979
AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

31:52.979 --> 31:55.381
SHE DID EXPRESS HER UNDYING LOVE

31:55.381 --> 31:57.283
TO YOU AND THAT, YOU KNOW,

31:57.283 --> 31:59.318
SHE LOST A LITTLE MORE WEIGHT

31:59.318 --> 32:03.789
AND SHE LOOKING FINE.

32:03.789 --> 32:05.491
EVERYBODY KNOWS WHEN A PERSON'S

32:05.491 --> 32:07.226
MORE IN LOVE WITH YOU

32:07.226 --> 32:08.527
THAN YOU ARE WITH THEM,

32:08.527 --> 32:10.296
THEN YOU GET TOP DOLLAR.

32:10.296 --> 32:11.797
SHE ADORES THE WAY HE WALKS,

32:11.797 --> 32:13.265
HE TALKS, HE SLEEPS.

32:13.265 --> 32:16.102
SHE FEEDS OFF HIS ENERGY.

32:16.102 --> 32:17.669
AND THAT SON OF MINE'S

32:17.669 --> 32:19.138
CAN'T SEE IT?

32:19.138 --> 32:20.106
HUH.

32:20.106 --> 32:21.007
THERE'S TOO MUCH FOREST

32:21.007 --> 32:23.342
AND TREES IN THE MIX.

32:23.342 --> 32:25.011
IF SHE HIT YOU UP,

32:25.011 --> 32:27.646
WOULD YOU HAVE LUNCH WITH HER?

32:27.646 --> 32:29.615
YOU KNOW, JUST TO BE A BASIC

32:29.615 --> 32:31.017
CONVERSATION, "HOW YOU DOING

32:31.017 --> 32:32.184
AND HOW THINGS BEEN GOING ON

32:32.184 --> 32:33.219
WITH YOU."

32:33.219 --> 32:34.586
WOULD YOU?

32:34.586 --> 32:35.787
NOT RIGHT NOW.

32:35.787 --> 32:36.855
OH, YOU JUST KNOW YOU JUST

32:36.855 --> 32:37.923
WANT TO.

32:37.923 --> 32:38.824
CHILL OUT ON THAT,

32:38.824 --> 32:39.525
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

32:39.525 --> 32:41.460
LIKE, YOU KNOW, YOUR

32:41.460 --> 32:43.029
SOON-TO-BE DAUGHTER-IN-LAW...

32:43.029 --> 32:43.695
OKAY.

32:43.695 --> 32:44.363
GET COOL WITH HER,

32:44.363 --> 32:45.731
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

32:45.731 --> 32:46.432
OH, WELL, ALL RIGHT.

32:46.432 --> 32:47.333
THANKSGIVING.

32:47.333 --> 32:49.135
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

32:49.135 --> 32:50.236
BIRTHDAYS.

32:50.236 --> 32:51.437
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

32:51.437 --> 32:52.438
YEAH, COME ON, LET'S GET IT

32:52.438 --> 32:53.139
TOGETHER.

32:53.139 --> 32:54.206
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

32:54.206 --> 32:55.174
FOR REAL.

32:55.174 --> 32:56.042
WELL...

32:56.042 --> 32:57.643
'CAUSE THAT ONE GONE.

32:57.643 --> 33:00.046
UH, ANYWAY,

33:00.046 --> 33:01.680
MOMMA LOVE YOU SO.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.682
I LOVE YOU.

33:03.682 --> 33:04.583
I DON'T WANT ERICA TO SEE

33:04.583 --> 33:05.517
THAT LIPSTICK.

33:05.517 --> 33:06.218
SHE MIGHT THINK IT CAME

33:06.218 --> 33:06.952
FROM SHAY.

33:06.952 --> 33:08.520
SHE WOULDN'T THINK THAT.

33:08.520 --> 33:09.788
SHE WOULD NEVER THINK THAT.

33:09.788 --> 33:10.789
SHE MIGHT.

33:10.789 --> 33:13.459
NO, SHE WOULDN'T.

33:13.459 --> 33:14.793
POO-POO,

33:14.793 --> 33:17.929
I WANT TO GET A BLUE ONE, COZ.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.111
YOU HAPPY THESE DAYS?

33:32.111 --> 33:33.612
DECENT.

33:33.612 --> 33:34.346
DECENT?

33:34.346 --> 33:36.682
YEAH.

33:36.682 --> 33:37.616
'CAUSE I COULD TELL WHEN YOU

33:37.616 --> 33:38.484
LOOK AT ME AND WHEN YOU TALK TO

33:38.484 --> 33:39.585
ME AND WHEN YOU SMILE AT ME,

33:39.585 --> 33:41.120
IT'S LIKE REAL BLANK SPACE

33:41.120 --> 33:42.388
WITH US RIGHT NOW,

33:42.388 --> 33:43.922
A REAL GRAY AREA

33:43.922 --> 33:46.292
THAT WE GOT TO FILL IN.

33:46.292 --> 33:47.159
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO ABOUT

33:47.159 --> 33:49.761
THE GRAY AREA?

33:49.761 --> 33:50.862
THAT WOULD BE A QUESTION

33:50.862 --> 33:53.499
THAT I WOULD ASK YOU.

33:53.499 --> 33:54.533
GET SOME CRAYONS.

33:54.533 --> 33:56.202
GET SOME OF EVA'S CRAYONS.

33:56.202 --> 33:57.103
FILL IT IN.

33:57.103 --> 33:58.404
FILLING IN.

33:58.404 --> 33:59.438
I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING

33:59.438 --> 34:00.706
THIS, BUT EVER SINCE

34:00.706 --> 34:01.873
STEVIE KICKED JOSELINE

34:01.873 --> 34:03.375
OUT OF THE HOUSE, THE THREE

34:03.375 --> 34:04.576
OF US HAVE BEEN SPENDING

34:04.576 --> 34:06.112
MORE TIME TOGETHER,

34:06.112 --> 34:08.214
AND LIFE IS DRAMA-FREE.

34:08.214 --> 34:09.315
BUT IF STEVIE THINKS HE'S GONNA

34:09.315 --> 34:11.283
ADD SOME "COLOR" TO OUR

34:11.283 --> 34:13.885
RELATIONSHIP...

34:13.885 --> 34:15.687
HE'S IN NEVER-NEVER LAND.

34:15.687 --> 34:16.655
GREEN WORKS.

34:16.655 --> 34:18.157
IT'S THAT EASY?

34:18.157 --> 34:19.325
I MEAN, YEAH, EVERYTHING

34:19.325 --> 34:20.126
IS EASY AS WE MAKE IT.

34:20.126 --> 34:20.792
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

34:20.792 --> 34:21.627
GREEN WORKS?

34:21.627 --> 34:22.361
YEAH.

34:22.361 --> 34:23.195
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

34:23.195 --> 34:26.798
I MEAN, GREEN WORKS.

34:26.798 --> 34:27.999
YOU NEED SOMETHING?

34:27.999 --> 34:29.135
DON'T BE--DON'T--

34:29.135 --> 34:30.136
MM-MMM, MM-MMM.

34:30.136 --> 34:32.238
YOU BELIEVE THAT MONEY

34:32.238 --> 34:33.372
FIXES EVERYTHING,

34:33.372 --> 34:34.406
AND IT DOES NOT.

34:34.406 --> 34:36.775
IT FIXES 89.95%

34:36.775 --> 34:37.509
OF EVERYTHING.

34:37.509 --> 34:38.544
WELL, THE OTHER PERCENTAGE

34:38.544 --> 34:40.546
IS MY ISSUE,

34:40.546 --> 34:41.680
NOT THE MONEY.

34:41.680 --> 34:43.449
AND THE MONEY WILL NOT FIX

34:43.449 --> 34:44.283
WHAT I HAVE A PROBLEM WITH

34:44.283 --> 34:45.184
WITH YOU.

34:45.184 --> 34:45.851
IT WON'T?

34:45.851 --> 34:46.652
NOT AT ALL.

34:46.652 --> 34:47.319
I DON'T GIVE--

34:47.319 --> 34:48.053
GIFTS?

34:48.053 --> 34:48.954
NO.

34:48.954 --> 34:49.621
YOU COULD GIFT--

34:49.621 --> 34:50.422
CARS, DIAMONDS?

34:50.422 --> 34:52.691
YOU COULD GIFT DIAMOND,

34:52.691 --> 34:54.526
MAKE ME UNTIL YOU TURN--

34:54.526 --> 34:55.427
BAGS?

34:55.427 --> 34:56.162
BAG ME.

34:56.162 --> 34:56.995
LOUIS STEWART BAGS?

34:56.995 --> 34:59.298
I AIN'T SEEN ONE YET.

34:59.298 --> 35:00.432
WHAT I GOT TO DO?

35:00.432 --> 35:01.600
YOU SHOULDN'T ASK ME

35:01.600 --> 35:02.834
WHAT YOU SHOULD DO.

35:02.834 --> 35:04.770
YOU, KNOWING ME

35:04.770 --> 35:05.671
AND KNOWING ME AS LONG

35:05.671 --> 35:07.373
AS YOU HAVE, SHOULD KNOW

35:07.373 --> 35:09.775
EXACTLY WHAT TO DO.

35:09.775 --> 35:11.210
I WANT TO DO THAT.

35:11.210 --> 35:11.977
I WANT TO TRY TO DO THAT.

35:11.977 --> 35:12.678
IT'S LIKE...

35:12.678 --> 35:13.512
[imitates brakes squealing]

35:13.512 --> 35:14.680
PUT THE BLOCK UP.

35:14.680 --> 35:16.182
WHY DO I DO THAT?

35:16.182 --> 35:17.516
INSECURITIES.

35:17.516 --> 35:18.717
UH, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

35:18.717 --> 35:19.518
MY INSECURITY?

35:19.518 --> 35:20.552
I MEAN, YEAH, OF BEING--

35:20.552 --> 35:21.220
CAN I JUST FINISH WHAT

35:21.220 --> 35:21.887
I WAS GONNA SAY?

35:21.887 --> 35:23.189
OF BEING HURT AGAIN.

35:23.189 --> 35:24.356
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

35:24.356 --> 35:25.191
ALL THE PREVIOUS THINGS

35:25.191 --> 35:26.658
THAT I'VE DONE.

35:26.658 --> 35:27.493
AND I MEAN THAT WOULD CAUSE

35:27.493 --> 35:28.227
A PERSON--

35:28.227 --> 35:28.994
IS THAT THE DOOR?

35:28.994 --> 35:29.761
YEAH, THAT'S THE DOOR.

35:29.761 --> 35:30.462
STEVIE, WHAT, YOU GOT

35:30.462 --> 35:31.530
THE HEATER ON IN HERE?

35:31.530 --> 35:32.431
IT'S HOT IN--

35:32.431 --> 35:33.098

35:37.969 --> 35:38.870
OKAY.

35:38.870 --> 35:39.871
YOU NOT GONNA SPEAK?

35:39.871 --> 35:41.207

36:00.926 --> 36:01.693
BITCH, YOU AIN'T PUT ME

36:01.693 --> 36:02.494

36:14.606 --> 36:15.574
WE CAN'T HAVE A CONVERSATION?

36:15.574 --> 36:16.508

36:29.588 --> 36:30.856

36:30.856 --> 36:31.523
TO SIT UP THERE AND WASTE

36:31.523 --> 36:32.758
MY TIME WITH YOUR MAID.

36:32.758 --> 36:33.525
SHE NEEDS TO COME CLEAN

36:33.525 --> 36:34.360
MY CONDO.

36:34.360 --> 36:35.261
THAT'S WHAT SHE NEEDS TO DO.

36:35.261 --> 36:36.127
MY DOOR'S ALWAYS OPEN

36:36.127 --> 36:37.496

36:37.496 --> 36:38.330
RING THE DOORBELL OR SOME

36:38.330 --> 36:38.997
[bleep].

36:38.997 --> 36:39.831
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

36:39.831 --> 36:40.766
IT'S JUST LIKE, YOU JUST BARGING

36:40.766 --> 36:41.833

36:49.941 --> 36:50.676
IT WAS A JOKE.

36:50.676 --> 36:51.510
SHE MADE A JOKE.

36:51.510 --> 36:54.112
YOU GET YOUR [bleep]...

37:02.288 --> 37:05.424
ONCE AGAIN, AFTER 15 YEARS

37:05.424 --> 37:07.058
OF KNOWING THIS MOTHER[bleep],

37:07.058 --> 37:08.794
I STILL WANT TO BELIEVE

37:08.794 --> 37:09.761
AND LISTEN.

37:09.761 --> 37:11.430
GOT TO BE NICE, MIMI.

37:11.430 --> 37:13.299
GET MORE BEES WITH HONEY.

37:13.299 --> 37:15.634
IT'S ALL BULL[bleep].

37:15.634 --> 37:16.568
AS SOON AS THAT GORILLA

37:16.568 --> 37:17.469
WALKED THROUGH THE DOOR,

37:17.469 --> 37:19.204
HE WENT BACK ON EVERYTHING

37:19.204 --> 37:20.739
HE SAID, DEFENDING ME,

37:20.739 --> 37:22.574
DEFENDING HIS DAUGHTER,

37:22.574 --> 37:23.475
HIS FAMILY.

37:23.475 --> 37:24.743
HE DIDN'T DO [bleep].

37:24.743 --> 37:25.711
YOU GONNA MAKE THIS BITCH

37:25.711 --> 37:26.512
COME HERE WHERE I STAY

37:26.512 --> 37:27.646
AND YOUR DAUGHTER AND [bleep]
