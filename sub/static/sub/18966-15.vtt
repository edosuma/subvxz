00:02.261 --> 00:03.795
I don't know, Evan! I just...

00:03.797 --> 00:05.096
Riley! Are you okay?

00:05.098 --> 00:06.563
Let's get you home! No, Evan! Stop!

00:06.564 --> 00:07.397
No, I've got it from here.

00:07.399 --> 00:09.499
No, I just can't take it!

00:12.335 --> 00:14.036
Riley!

00:15.605 --> 00:17.372
Riley, hold up! Look, Kyle! Please!

00:17.374 --> 00:19.207
Hey, talk to me. Just stop.

00:19.209 --> 00:20.909
Not right now.
- Riley!

00:20.911 --> 00:22.544
Will both of you just stop, please?

00:22.546 --> 00:23.545
You're gonna wake up the kids. I'm fine.

00:23.547 --> 00:25.946
Seeing as I almost ran you over
in the middle of the street,

00:25.948 --> 00:26.946
I think you're anything but fine.

00:26.948 --> 00:28.981
What are you even
doing here at this hour?

00:28.983 --> 00:29.949
Go home! We couldn't find you.

00:29.951 --> 00:31.817
Look. I've been calling
you all day. I'm worried.

00:31.819 --> 00:32.885
You are mixed up with
some dangerous people.

00:32.887 --> 00:35.087
Okay, you know what? I
trusted the wrong girl, okay,

00:35.089 --> 00:37.522
and I got screwed over,
so I had to fire her today,

00:37.524 --> 00:38.457
and then I got pissed.

00:38.459 --> 00:39.690
Okay, it's business! I am fine!

00:39.692 --> 00:41.491
If you are in some kind of
trouble, you need to tell us.

00:41.493 --> 00:43.394
You know what? I'm not
gonna have this conversation.

00:43.396 --> 00:46.562
I don't know what you two want
from me, but I've got to dry off.

00:46.930 --> 00:47.931
Don't follow me!

00:50.767 --> 00:52.300
She's your wife.

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074

01:30.600 --> 01:33.567
You have no idea how
long I've waited for this.

01:33.569 --> 01:37.403
Well, the wait's over. I am all yours.

01:37.405 --> 01:39.438
I could have been all yours.

01:40.206 --> 01:42.206
Riley Parks, you are under arrest.

01:42.208 --> 01:46.443
Mom. Mom.

01:46.445 --> 01:47.879
Pancakes are burning.

01:47.881 --> 01:49.079
Oh, damn. Sorry.

01:49.081 --> 01:50.747
Mom, you okay? Yeah, I'm fine, baby.

01:50.749 --> 01:53.083
Just go sit, and I'll make a new batch.

01:53.085 --> 01:55.951
Leave it. Leave it. I got it, all right?

01:56.152 --> 01:56.851
You got up early.

01:56.853 --> 02:00.388
Well, I couldn't sleep. I
wanted to get the kids ready.

02:00.390 --> 02:01.388
Hey, are we okay?

02:01.390 --> 02:03.324
I don't know. You tell me.

02:03.326 --> 02:04.324
I can't help you if you won't let me in.

02:04.326 --> 02:07.794
Mommy, Daddy, can I have
chocolate chips in my pancakes?

02:07.796 --> 02:10.795
No, not for breakfast. Yes, you c...

02:11.164 --> 02:12.465
Your mom is right. Not for breakfast.

02:12.467 --> 02:14.065
Now go sit at the table.

02:14.067 --> 02:16.133
Daddy's famous pancakes are ready.

02:16.135 --> 02:17.536
You don't have famous pancakes.

02:17.538 --> 02:21.604
Oh, yeah? Well, I do now.
Who wants blueberries?

02:21.606 --> 02:22.973
I do! I do!

02:22.975 --> 02:24.340
All right.

02:24.342 --> 02:26.275
They're good for you.

02:32.214 --> 02:35.716
No! No, no, no, no, no, no!

02:39.253 --> 02:41.453
Hey, this is a work
thing. I got to take it.

02:41.455 --> 02:44.456
Yeah. Yeah, I'll get
them ready for school.

02:44.458 --> 02:47.993
Selena, is everything okay?
It's kind of a bad time.

02:47.995 --> 02:50.061
No way. Everything's
fine. I was just, um...

02:50.063 --> 02:51.361
I was just wondering if
you wanted me to start

02:51.363 --> 02:52.964
that morning meeting without you.

02:52.966 --> 02:54.565
Oh, God, I should have called you.

02:54.567 --> 02:55.499
I'm sorry. I'm gonna be late.

02:55.501 --> 02:58.668
Yeah, it's no problem. You
got a lot on your plate.

02:58.670 --> 03:00.036
Hey, you...

03:00.038 --> 03:02.003
Good morning.

03:02.005 --> 03:03.605
You got any ideas how you're getting

03:03.607 --> 03:04.606
that missing thing back?

03:04.608 --> 03:07.409
I'm working on it.
Just cover for me, okay?

03:07.411 --> 03:09.043
Yeah, whatever I can do to help.

03:09.045 --> 03:12.646
And look. It's all of our
necks on the line here, okay?

03:12.648 --> 03:14.781
Yeah.

03:14.783 --> 03:17.650
All right, people, it's
time for the morning meeting,

03:17.652 --> 03:19.651
so, uh, let's gather 'round.

03:19.653 --> 03:20.752
Oh, hold up. Where's Riley?

03:20.754 --> 03:22.854
Well, that's none of
your business, Mister.

03:22.856 --> 03:25.590
Well, take a seat. Go on.

03:25.592 --> 03:27.825
Okay, guys, Riley's put me in charge.

03:27.827 --> 03:28.758
And until she comes back,

03:28.760 --> 03:31.227
you will all refer to me as "Ms. Ramos."

03:31.229 --> 03:33.430
Come on. That's not gonna happen.

03:33.432 --> 03:35.497
Hey, one more laugh
out of you, girly man,

03:35.499 --> 03:37.198
and you will be on bathroom detail,

03:37.200 --> 03:38.733
and it ain't pretty in there.

03:38.735 --> 03:40.101
All right?

03:40.103 --> 03:42.303
Hey! Zip it up.

03:42.404 --> 03:44.838
Focus.

03:51.244 --> 03:53.079
Riley! We need to talk.

03:53.081 --> 03:54.546
Look. I don't trust you, okay?

03:54.548 --> 03:55.980
I'm never gonna trust you again.

03:55.982 --> 03:57.482
But if you want to know
how you can make this right,

03:57.484 --> 03:58.482
I'm gonna tell you how to start.

03:58.484 --> 03:59.583
If I could take this all back, I would.

03:59.585 --> 04:01.417
You betrayed me, and
if you ever do it again,

04:01.419 --> 04:03.287
you're never gonna live
it down, you got me?

04:03.289 --> 04:05.021
I'll do anything to fix this.

04:05.023 --> 04:06.788
Damn straight you will.

04:12.630 --> 04:15.229
Is there somewhere I can
talk to you privately?

04:15.497 --> 04:17.697
Look. I'm kind of in the
middle of something here so...

04:17.700 --> 04:19.866
I need to find out what's
going on with Riley.

04:19.868 --> 04:22.535
Look, you're the last person
that I want to come to for help,

04:22.537 --> 04:23.969
especially when it involves my wife,

04:23.971 --> 04:25.371
but I'm worried about her, all right?

04:25.373 --> 04:27.606
And I don't know what to do.

04:35.414 --> 04:38.414
So, how bad is it? What
exactly do you know?

04:38.416 --> 04:41.650
Nothing specific. Has
Riley told you anything?

04:41.652 --> 04:43.518
Oh, come on, man. You
saw her last night.

04:43.520 --> 04:45.020
Every time I try to talk to
her, she just shuts me out,

04:45.022 --> 04:47.989
saying something about how she's
just gonna handle it all on her own.

04:47.991 --> 04:49.423
Well, maybe she's telling the truth.

04:49.425 --> 04:52.526
Maybe it's just business. You
know, she is a tough woman.

04:52.528 --> 04:53.826
Oh, come on. Don't give me that.

04:53.828 --> 04:57.363
You're my brother. I can tell when
you're hiding something from me.

04:57.365 --> 04:58.897
Look, you and I, we've had our problems.

04:58.899 --> 05:01.098
All right, but if Riley's in danger,

05:01.100 --> 05:04.669
we need to put all that
aside and help her out.

05:04.671 --> 05:07.705
I'll keep my eye on her, but
she doesn't tell me squat.

05:07.707 --> 05:09.439
If she's gonna talk to
anyone, it's gonna be you.

05:09.441 --> 05:12.342
Yeah. How do I get her to talk to me?

05:12.344 --> 05:13.642
By trusting her.

05:13.644 --> 05:16.244
Letting her know you're
gonna be there for her,

05:16.246 --> 05:17.646
no matter what.

05:17.648 --> 05:20.214
Same way she was there for you.

05:23.185 --> 05:24.685
Yeah.

05:28.689 --> 05:29.322
He's here.

05:29.324 --> 05:32.425
Good. I talked to Nikki. It's on.

05:32.427 --> 05:35.193
He started on his Scotch early.

05:35.195 --> 05:37.228
Really? It's not even noon.

05:37.230 --> 05:40.597
Does it matter? This time
tomorrow, we'll all be in jail.

05:40.599 --> 05:41.864
We're not going anywhere.

05:41.866 --> 05:42.833
Now, you get ahold of yourself.

05:42.835 --> 05:46.168
Get... We've got 24 hours
before Carlyle makes good

05:46.170 --> 05:48.770
on his threat to reveal
that list, which means...

05:48.772 --> 05:51.739
Yeah, which means I have 24
hours to get the client list,

05:51.741 --> 05:53.874
or we're all destroyed.

05:53.876 --> 05:55.409
Oh, not just us, darling.

05:55.411 --> 05:56.976
Everyone you've ever cared about,

05:56.978 --> 05:59.546
everyone who's even
touched by that list.

05:59.548 --> 06:01.046
When a bomb like this explodes,

06:01.048 --> 06:03.649
there's no controlling who gets hurt.

06:04.317 --> 06:05.950
That's never gonna happen.

06:05.952 --> 06:08.153
Ah! I'm cutting you off.

06:08.155 --> 06:10.488
If we're getting out of
this, we need you sharp.

06:10.490 --> 06:14.591
Please just delay the task
force as long as possible.

06:16.159 --> 06:17.894
I'll do what I can.

06:18.362 --> 06:20.162
Ladies.

06:21.697 --> 06:25.033
Okay. I've got a plan
to get us out of this.

06:25.035 --> 06:26.300
Now, besides what's in my office,

06:26.302 --> 06:30.404
are there any other papers pertaining
to the list that I don't know about?

06:30.406 --> 06:33.173
No, everything was in the file cabinet.

06:33.175 --> 06:37.643
What we need to do is get rid
of any incriminating evidence,

06:37.645 --> 06:38.276
not just the list.

06:38.278 --> 06:40.712
Exactly, which is why I
shredded all the financials.

06:40.714 --> 06:43.181
Well, you can shred
till the cows come home.

06:43.183 --> 06:46.116
Do you have an exit strategy?

06:48.919 --> 06:50.220
The Rub's insurance policy?

06:50.222 --> 06:52.756
Just keep it here in the safe, okay?

06:53.090 --> 06:55.057
Look, if all goes as planned,

06:55.059 --> 06:59.193
we're gonna be able to walk out
of this thing with our hands clean.

07:08.504 --> 07:09.536
Hey.

07:09.538 --> 07:12.472
Sorry. I've been swamped
with this Task Force.

07:12.474 --> 07:13.673
No problem.

07:13.675 --> 07:14.706
Can't really talk about it.

07:14.708 --> 07:16.875
We've got a big interrogation coming in.

07:16.877 --> 07:20.846
One of the girls we've been
watching decided to flip on Carlyle.

07:21.447 --> 07:22.346
What's with the packing?

07:22.348 --> 07:23.848
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

07:23.850 --> 07:27.884
I got called to Detectives.
Found out yesterday.

07:27.886 --> 07:29.585
That's great!

07:30.153 --> 07:32.121
So you and me...

07:32.123 --> 07:33.923
We're no longer partners.

07:33.925 --> 07:36.125
Well, at least not on the job.

07:36.759 --> 07:37.826
What division?

07:37.828 --> 07:39.827
Internal Affairs.

07:39.829 --> 07:42.496
Wow. That can get pretty intense.

07:42.498 --> 07:46.133
That's what I heard. I'm cool with it.

07:46.401 --> 07:48.768
The law has to come first.

07:49.702 --> 07:53.672
You covering for Riley when she
found Foster, that's safe with me.

07:53.674 --> 07:56.774
But from this point,
I can't protect you.

07:57.642 --> 08:00.778
Shelby... You're a great cop, Evan.

08:00.780 --> 08:03.112
Don't screw it up.

08:09.651 --> 08:12.220
I'm here to see Detective Monroe.

08:15.792 --> 08:19.758
Michelle, I told you
to get calla lilies,

08:19.760 --> 08:21.528
not whatever the hell these are.

08:21.530 --> 08:22.294
I'm sorry, Ms. Ramos.

08:22.296 --> 08:25.230
Mike Wetanson just
canceled his appointment.

08:25.232 --> 08:26.631
What's his excuse?

08:26.633 --> 08:27.432
Yesterday's storm.

08:27.434 --> 08:28.499
It messed up everybody's schedules.

08:28.501 --> 08:31.135
Fine. Usually I charge
for same-day cancellations,

08:31.137 --> 08:34.004
but I suppose an act
of God earns you a pass.

08:34.006 --> 08:36.772
Derek, sweetie, be a doll
and get me a cup of coffee.

08:36.774 --> 08:38.341
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

08:38.342 --> 08:40.842
Hey. Can I talk to you for a second?

08:44.179 --> 08:44.545
What?

08:44.547 --> 08:46.680
How great was it waking up
next to each other this morning?

08:46.682 --> 08:48.015
You slipping into bed last
night... Look, look, look.

08:48.017 --> 08:50.985
Now's not really the time. People
might hear us. So? Let them.

08:50.987 --> 08:52.619
Look, I want to start
every day like that.

08:52.621 --> 08:54.753
See? This is what I was afraid of.

08:54.755 --> 08:55.788
You give me your key for one night,

08:55.790 --> 08:57.890
next thing I know, you're
talking about me moving in.

08:57.892 --> 08:58.757
Will you cool your jets?

08:58.759 --> 09:00.191
All I'm saying is that
my morning would...

09:00.193 --> 09:03.561
Would be better with you around.

09:03.563 --> 09:05.696
Fine. But I just want
to be clear with you.

09:05.698 --> 09:07.030
It's one thing to give me your key.

09:07.032 --> 09:08.998
It's another thing to ask
me to give up my whole life.

09:09.000 --> 09:10.199
I'm not asking you to give your life.

09:10.201 --> 09:12.167
I'm asking you to let
me be a part of it.

09:13.938 --> 09:16.638
Amelie! Amelie! Please, calm down.

09:17.540 --> 09:20.441
<i>Bonjour.</i>

09:21.343 --> 09:22.209
I could learn.

09:22.211 --> 09:25.044
Uh, Michelle, I'll take it from here.

09:25.046 --> 09:28.080
Hi! How can I help you?

09:28.082 --> 09:29.447
Selena, they're French, not deaf.

09:29.449 --> 09:32.350
Okay, I am sorry. My
English is not so good.

09:32.352 --> 09:35.119
But we missed our flight
yesterday because of the storm.

09:35.121 --> 09:37.855
And my girlfriend and
I, we are very exhausted.

09:37.857 --> 09:39.956
We would like to relax.
Are you open for a massage?

09:39.958 --> 09:40.858
Oh, yeah. You're just in luck.

09:40.860 --> 09:43.226
We, uh... We have a few openings, right?

09:43.228 --> 09:46.429
Uh, I'll be happy to take
care of you and, uh...

09:48.765 --> 09:52.633
I have just the therapist
for your lovely girlfriend.

09:52.635 --> 09:54.034
Michelle.

09:55.972 --> 09:59.872
Uh, actually, Derek is all
booked up for the day, so...

09:59.874 --> 10:03.309
Actually, no. I'm
pretty wide-open, so...

10:03.643 --> 10:06.978
Can you just give us
a sec? Just one sec.

10:07.780 --> 10:09.479
Come here!

10:09.781 --> 10:10.949
What?

10:10.951 --> 10:12.215
Just let Michelle take this one.

10:12.217 --> 10:13.850
She doesn't even have
her massage license yet.

10:13.852 --> 10:16.852
So? What Marie-Antoinette
doesn't know won't kill her.

10:16.854 --> 10:17.920
Uh-uh, what's going on here?

10:17.922 --> 10:20.856
What? I'm just trying to be a good boss.

10:20.858 --> 10:23.358
Oh, don't begrudge me
for trying to be a mentor

10:23.360 --> 10:24.959
to an aspiring massage therapist.

10:24.961 --> 10:26.460
Plus, Riley told us that
we need to be careful.

10:26.462 --> 10:30.063
You don't want me taking
the hot client. Oh, please.

10:30.065 --> 10:30.731
Who are you talking to?

10:30.733 --> 10:32.165
Someone who enjoyed
waking up next to me,

10:32.167 --> 10:35.802
just as much as I enjoyed
waking up next to her.

10:37.203 --> 10:38.936
He's all yours!

10:39.438 --> 10:41.639
Yes, she is.

10:42.341 --> 10:44.007
<i>Bonjour.</i>

10:47.712 --> 10:49.812
Come on. Right this way.

10:49.814 --> 10:53.615
I know I should have said something
before. I was just so scared.

10:53.617 --> 10:54.582
It's good that you're here now.

10:54.584 --> 10:56.884
So, where is Carlyle
trafficking in his girls from?

10:56.886 --> 10:59.386
Eastern Europe, Thailand... All over.

10:59.388 --> 11:00.588
How does it work?

11:00.590 --> 11:01.955
The girls come in shipping containers

11:01.957 --> 11:05.892
through the port at Galveston and
go straight to the Violet Orchid.

11:05.894 --> 11:09.060
<i>In fact, there's a shipment
scheduled for tonight.</i>

11:09.062 --> 11:11.297
We have to intercept
tonight's Galveston shipment.

11:11.299 --> 11:13.365
Well, since Carlyle's girls
are sent to the Violet Orchid,

11:13.367 --> 11:17.835
I'll approve a raid on that
establishment, but none of the others.

11:17.837 --> 11:19.469
This investigation has to be airtight.

11:19.471 --> 11:20.471
But our surveillance cameras...

11:20.473 --> 11:22.438
Are still good for
all of Carlyle's clubs.

11:22.440 --> 11:25.742
But the first raid has to be where
the girls come in from the port,

11:25.744 --> 11:29.110
and that's the Violet
Orchid. Understood.

11:31.014 --> 11:32.847
Keep an eye on Wild Nights.

11:32.849 --> 11:34.914
If the raid on the
Violet Orchid goes bad,

11:34.916 --> 11:36.916
Carlyle might react fast.

11:36.918 --> 11:38.618
Yes, sir.

11:39.085 --> 11:42.321
How do we trust you?
You lied to us once.

11:42.323 --> 11:45.891
I'm telling you the truth, I swear.

11:46.126 --> 11:47.358
I know I've made some mistakes,

11:47.360 --> 11:50.461
but I'm trying to set things right.

11:54.198 --> 11:56.465
Okay, if you're... Oh! Comfortable...

11:56.467 --> 11:59.501
I guess I came in too soon.

12:01.304 --> 12:04.805
So, what can I work on today?

12:08.643 --> 12:13.179
Uh... Oh, you want me to
work on your hands. Got it.

12:13.313 --> 12:13.979
In my line of work,

12:13.981 --> 12:16.982
hands and forearms can get really tight.

12:22.387 --> 12:26.157
Yes, the weather has been
really crazy lately, hasn't it?

12:26.159 --> 12:28.625
I know. That storm was a real doozy.

12:32.328 --> 12:33.662
Can you tell me specifically

12:33.664 --> 12:36.697
what you'd like me to work on next?

12:44.738 --> 12:46.106
Oh.

12:48.108 --> 12:51.476
There are certain benefits in
having your flight canceled.

12:51.478 --> 12:53.244
Your hands are quite special.

12:53.246 --> 12:55.013
Oh, you do this as long as I have,

12:55.015 --> 12:56.380
and you pick up a trick or two.

12:56.382 --> 12:57.714
Mmm, I would love to learn

12:57.716 --> 12:59.148
what tricks you have up your sleeve.

12:59.150 --> 13:01.185
Well, let's just say David Copperfield

13:01.187 --> 13:04.653
has nothing on me when
it comes to rubdowns.

13:04.887 --> 13:05.721
Who?

13:05.723 --> 13:07.422
Never mind.

13:07.424 --> 13:10.725
So, you're from France, huh?

13:10.727 --> 13:11.093
Mmm.

13:11.095 --> 13:13.893
Furthest I've ever been is New Orleans.

13:14.028 --> 13:16.197
Most of that trip's still hazy.

13:16.199 --> 13:17.430
You would love Paris.

13:17.432 --> 13:20.200
<i>Ah, mon dieu, you should see the world.</i>

13:20.202 --> 13:23.535
Hmm, right. Right
after I win the lottery.

13:23.537 --> 13:25.104
Turn over.

13:26.605 --> 13:28.272
I'll buy you a ticket.

13:29.140 --> 13:30.808
Show you my country.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.175
Sure. Mmm-hmm.

13:32.177 --> 13:34.610
And your girlfriend and I
could be roommates, right?

13:34.612 --> 13:37.980
Don't worry about
Amelie. She and I are more

13:37.982 --> 13:40.349
like travel companions with certain...

13:40.351 --> 13:42.784
How do you say... Benefits?

13:42.786 --> 13:45.320
Good luck with that.

13:45.322 --> 13:49.822
Before you know it, she's gonna
start changing the rules on you.

13:49.824 --> 13:50.591
First it's a key.

13:50.593 --> 13:53.593
Then she's gonna want
to start playing house.

13:53.826 --> 13:54.559
I highly doubt that.

13:54.561 --> 13:58.096
Right now, she's probably
seducing your handsome friend.

13:59.731 --> 14:00.465
Really?

14:00.467 --> 14:04.300
And that, uh... Doesn't bother you?

14:04.468 --> 14:05.069
Of course not.

14:05.071 --> 14:07.604
Monogamy... It doesn't make sense to me.

14:07.606 --> 14:11.440
It's impossible for two people
to be faithful to each other.

14:11.442 --> 14:13.708
You really believe that?

14:14.143 --> 14:17.044
This how the way the world works.

14:17.046 --> 14:17.612
Men and women,

14:17.614 --> 14:20.615
we should live our
lives the way we want to.

14:20.617 --> 14:23.450
Not how others want us to.

14:26.087 --> 14:28.653
I like the way you think.

14:43.467 --> 14:45.501
Hey. Hi.

14:45.503 --> 14:46.268
You seen her yet?

14:46.270 --> 14:48.470
Not yet. I got Linette's
call and came straight over.

14:48.472 --> 14:50.672
Did she say why she
needed to see us so badly?

14:50.674 --> 14:52.239
No, just that it was important

14:52.241 --> 14:53.806
and she needed to
do it face-to-face.

14:53.808 --> 14:56.376
Let me see that baby.

14:56.378 --> 14:58.977
Are you not the cutest little chick

14:58.979 --> 15:00.547
that ever was hatched?

15:00.549 --> 15:01.847
You must be Cole.

15:01.849 --> 15:03.981
I'm your Auntie Linette.

15:03.983 --> 15:04.917
Mama.

15:04.919 --> 15:07.218
I am so happy for you and Dale.

15:07.220 --> 15:08.952
Thanks, Linette.

15:09.287 --> 15:11.655
You deserve everything that's wonderful.

15:11.657 --> 15:12.889
Okay, so, when you called,

15:12.891 --> 15:16.592
you said that it was
important. Everything okay?

15:16.594 --> 15:18.060
Better than okay. Everything's great.

15:18.062 --> 15:20.496
Well, that's good,
'cause you had us worried.

15:20.498 --> 15:22.997
Yeah... So, what was so urgent?

15:23.165 --> 15:23.864
You two girls

15:23.866 --> 15:26.600
are the most important
people in the world to me.

15:26.602 --> 15:29.168
I could have never gotten
healthy without you.

15:29.170 --> 15:30.971
Well, we love you, Mama.

15:30.973 --> 15:32.872
I know... That's why it's so hard

15:32.874 --> 15:35.107
to give you my good news.

15:35.109 --> 15:35.675
Good news?

15:35.677 --> 15:38.542
Do you remember my friend
Charlene down in Austin?

15:38.544 --> 15:40.612
Well, now that I'm getting out of here,

15:40.614 --> 15:42.746
she wants me to open a salon with her,

15:42.748 --> 15:44.747
and we're gonna do it our way.

15:44.749 --> 15:46.616
We're gonna be our own bosses.

15:46.618 --> 15:50.019
Wow. Mama, that's...

15:50.021 --> 15:54.088
That's great, but what about
your life here and your family?

15:54.090 --> 15:56.524
I'll visit all the time.

15:56.526 --> 15:57.758
Now that you've got Kyle back,

15:57.760 --> 16:00.328
you don't need me around
like you did last year.

16:00.330 --> 16:04.296
Mama, I always need
you, now more than ever.

16:05.166 --> 16:07.600
Are you sure this is what you want?

16:07.602 --> 16:11.269
I'm sure. I need to feel useful.

16:11.271 --> 16:15.206
And I wanted to tell
you two face-to-face.

16:15.841 --> 16:17.007
We understand.

16:17.009 --> 16:19.475
The most important part of being sober

16:19.477 --> 16:21.877
and living a healthy life

16:21.879 --> 16:24.780
is being honest with the ones you love.

16:30.120 --> 16:32.553
That's pretty incredible
about Linette, right?

16:32.555 --> 16:34.922
Yeah, I'm glad she's gonna be okay.

16:34.924 --> 16:37.023
I wish she had insurance.

16:37.025 --> 16:38.957
Okay, you were being weird in there.

16:38.959 --> 16:40.226
Is this about the list being stolen,

16:40.228 --> 16:41.493
or is something else going on?

16:41.495 --> 16:42.594
I don't know what you're talking about.

16:42.596 --> 16:44.395
Do not tell me you don't
know what I'm talking about.

16:44.397 --> 16:46.297
First, you tell me you
want me to take care

16:46.299 --> 16:48.465
of Kyle and the kids if
anything happens to you.

16:48.467 --> 16:49.499
And then you tell Linette

16:49.501 --> 16:52.535
that you're gonna need
her now more than ever.

16:52.537 --> 16:54.303
Spill it.

16:56.373 --> 16:59.574
Look... I can't be
Cole's Godmother, okay?

16:59.576 --> 17:01.743
What? Why on earth would you say that?

17:01.745 --> 17:04.945
I don't wanna go into it. It's just...

17:04.948 --> 17:08.446
It's dangerous for me to be
around you and your baby right now.

17:08.449 --> 17:10.317
Dangerous? I'm gonna fix it, okay?

17:10.319 --> 17:12.318
But until then, I need
to keep my distance.

17:12.319 --> 17:15.054
No, Riley, not good enough.

17:15.056 --> 17:17.188
You need to tell me what is going on.

17:17.190 --> 17:21.224
Look. Whatever it is, we
can work it out together.

17:21.925 --> 17:24.728
Your attack was because of me.

17:25.230 --> 17:29.097
I might be the reason
that you lost your baby.

17:29.365 --> 17:31.700
No, that's not possible.
It was a burglar.

17:31.702 --> 17:32.668
He didn't even know that I was there.

17:32.670 --> 17:35.671
He was looking for the client list.

17:38.206 --> 17:39.005
Oh, my God. Lacey...

17:39.007 --> 17:41.141
And you knew about this
all this time and you didn't

17:41.143 --> 17:44.476
say anything to me? No, I
didn't know the whole time.

17:45.079 --> 17:47.980
Lacey, will you please just look at me?

17:48.480 --> 17:53.650
I stood by you for everything.
I can't even look at you.

17:54.152 --> 17:55.820
Lacey.

17:56.020 --> 17:57.788
Just go.

18:08.199 --> 18:09.633
Okay, are you sure that Carlyle

18:09.635 --> 18:10.933
has the client list at Wild Nights?

18:10.935 --> 18:12.036
100%. Anything he really values...

18:12.038 --> 18:13.836
His guns, his cash... He
keeps in his office safe.

18:13.838 --> 18:16.339
You're not playing us again,
are you, Daisy Duke? No, I'm not.

18:16.341 --> 18:20.074
Because if you are, you are gonna rue
the day you set your foot in The Rub

18:20.076 --> 18:21.610
'cause I will... Georgia,
you're not helping.

18:21.612 --> 18:23.844
Okay, we need to stay on the same team.

18:23.846 --> 18:24.812
Okay, for now. Okay, great.

18:24.814 --> 18:26.547
Now, look, everything that
we've planned so far is working.

18:26.549 --> 18:29.315
Overton said that they are
gonna search the Violet Orchid,

18:29.317 --> 18:31.083
which means you should
be able to get Carlyle

18:31.085 --> 18:32.485
out of Wild Nights,
right? I can get him out.

18:32.487 --> 18:34.286
Okay, you need to do that
by 5:00, 'cause that's when

18:34.288 --> 18:36.355
they're gonna be
"auditioning" the new girls.

18:36.357 --> 18:37.056
Now, one more thing...

18:37.058 --> 18:38.523
When people start asking you questions,

18:38.525 --> 18:41.091
Carlyle went to The Rub
after you saw him today.

18:41.093 --> 18:42.026
Okay. Okay. Okay?

18:42.028 --> 18:44.061
Now, how are we doing
on your end? I'm good.

18:44.063 --> 18:45.094
I just need to know when to call.

18:45.096 --> 18:47.297
Remember that their names are Tatianna,

18:47.299 --> 18:48.998
Valeria, and Irina.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.265
Oh, and you're gonna need this.

18:50.267 --> 18:51.801
It's the code to Carlyle's safe.

18:51.803 --> 18:53.068
Only him and Buddy know it.

18:53.070 --> 18:54.836
Buddy? Carlyle's club manager.

18:54.838 --> 18:56.003
Nikki, this combo
better get me in there.

18:56.005 --> 18:59.473
It should. The safe is right
behind the desk. You can't miss it.

18:59.475 --> 19:01.442
That's got to be where
he's keeping the list.

19:01.444 --> 19:04.944
Okay, then, ladies, I
guess I have an audition.

19:05.044 --> 19:06.712
Riley.

19:07.281 --> 19:08.180
Be careful.

19:08.182 --> 19:09.414
Leave me alone! I'm not done with you!

19:09.416 --> 19:12.817
Nikki, no. You have no
idea what he is capable of.

19:12.819 --> 19:15.819
You're so sweet when you want to be.

19:20.824 --> 19:22.758
Thank you for a wonderful day.

19:22.760 --> 19:23.525
Oh, it's my pleasure.

19:23.527 --> 19:26.528
And if you're ever in Texas,
you know where to visit.

19:26.530 --> 19:28.796
I do, and when you're in Paris...

19:28.798 --> 19:30.730
I know who to call.

19:30.798 --> 19:32.699
I truly hope so.

19:34.035 --> 19:35.401
Well, bon voyage.

19:35.403 --> 19:37.337
My darling, shall we go?

19:41.441 --> 19:43.775
Nice couple.

19:43.777 --> 19:45.742
Yeah, real nice. Good massage?

19:45.744 --> 19:46.711
Real good.

19:46.713 --> 19:49.379
Professional. Same here. By the book.

19:49.381 --> 19:51.815
Okay, we got trouble, people.
The exterminator's on his way.

19:51.817 --> 19:55.350
I need everybody cleared
out of here... Right now.

19:55.418 --> 19:58.153
What is going on? Go!

19:58.621 --> 19:59.954
Uh...

19:59.956 --> 20:01.223
Okay. Termites.

20:01.225 --> 20:03.357
Well, that's what's
been eating all my money.

20:03.359 --> 20:04.792
She don't have to tell me twice.

20:04.794 --> 20:06.427
I'm sure there's a sale
out there somewhere.

20:06.429 --> 20:08.428
Hey, what do you say we hop on our bikes

20:08.430 --> 20:09.195
and go for a sunset ride?

20:09.197 --> 20:11.297
There's this trail I want to show you.

20:11.299 --> 20:14.999
You know, being boss
today really wore me out.

20:15.001 --> 20:18.836
You cool if I take it
easy tonight... Solo?

20:19.171 --> 20:20.637
Yeah, sure. It's cool.

20:20.639 --> 20:22.706
Yeah? Okay.

20:28.378 --> 20:30.879
Actually, it's not cool.

20:31.748 --> 20:32.380
What?

20:32.382 --> 20:33.515
Ever since I gave you my key,

20:33.517 --> 20:34.915
you've been acting
all distant around me.

20:34.917 --> 20:35.916
Will you give it a rest?

20:35.918 --> 20:38.752
No. You're trying to push me away,
Selena. And I'm not gonna let you.

20:38.754 --> 20:40.219
Oh, you're not gonna let me?

20:40.221 --> 20:41.555
Get real, Derek.

20:41.557 --> 20:43.056
Does this have anything to do

20:43.058 --> 20:44.057
with Riley getting sick yesterday,

20:44.059 --> 20:45.624
with her kicking Nikki out of The Rub?

20:45.626 --> 20:48.493
Look, I... I don't... I don't
know what you're talking about.

20:48.495 --> 20:49.860
Like hell you don't.

20:49.862 --> 20:51.329
Hey, if there's trouble,
you got to tell me.

20:51.331 --> 20:53.731
But there's no trouble. Riley's
got everything under control.

20:53.733 --> 20:55.732
What are you hiding? I
am not hiding anything.

20:55.734 --> 20:58.268
Look, I'm gonna be honest with
you. I want to give us a shot.

20:58.270 --> 20:59.902
But if there's any
chance in us working out,

20:59.904 --> 21:01.971
you got to be honest with me.

21:01.973 --> 21:02.905
Hey!

21:02.907 --> 21:05.406
You want honesty, hmm?

21:06.743 --> 21:08.142
Here.

21:08.144 --> 21:10.143
What's this?

21:10.378 --> 21:11.179
My tips.

21:11.181 --> 21:13.547
What? From the week? From today.

21:13.549 --> 21:14.847
You gave extras to that French guy?

21:14.849 --> 21:17.516
He's not even on the list, and
Riley told us to be careful.

21:17.518 --> 21:18.617
Look, Riley put me in charge,

21:18.619 --> 21:20.218
and I made an executive decision.

21:20.220 --> 21:21.520
Don't tell me you didn't visit

21:21.522 --> 21:22.987
the south of France
with that supermodel.

21:22.989 --> 21:24.322
I know you too well. I didn't.

21:24.324 --> 21:26.191
Oh, well, then why not?

21:26.193 --> 21:27.058
A, she's not on the list,

21:27.060 --> 21:29.259
and, B, I'd rather spend
my off-hours with you.

21:29.261 --> 21:31.895
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

21:31.897 --> 21:32.929
Just because we are dating

21:32.931 --> 21:34.729
does not mean that we're not
gonna give extras anymore.

21:34.731 --> 21:37.100
I never said that. You
keep jumping to conclusions.

21:37.102 --> 21:38.200
Okay, then what are you trying to say?

21:38.202 --> 21:40.034
All I'm saying is we
get each other, okay?

21:40.036 --> 21:41.236
I like having you in my life,

21:41.238 --> 21:42.903
and I want to keep
having you in my life,

21:42.905 --> 21:44.771
even when we stop working at The Rub.

21:44.773 --> 21:47.974
Are you telling me that I need to quit?

21:47.976 --> 21:50.008
There is no winning with you.

21:50.210 --> 21:51.010
You say you get me?

21:51.012 --> 21:54.279
Then you should know that
I don't trust guys, okay?

21:54.281 --> 21:57.815
Not even you, as much as I want to.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.350
I'm not gonna hurt you, Selena.

21:59.352 --> 22:00.817
That's what my ex-husband said.

22:00.819 --> 22:02.686
"I love you for you. Don't ever change."

22:02.688 --> 22:06.223
And then we move in together,
and he bangs the neighbor.

22:06.524 --> 22:09.191
Look, why did you have to

22:09.193 --> 22:11.026
go and change things?

22:11.028 --> 22:13.294
All I did was give you my key, okay?

22:13.296 --> 22:16.030
If you're not ready for
that... It doesn't matter.

22:16.032 --> 22:18.298
It's still changed.

22:20.300 --> 22:22.435
You know what?

22:25.572 --> 22:28.406
I think you should take this back.

22:34.479 --> 22:36.714
I want to be with you, Selena.

22:36.716 --> 22:40.682
But this is one decision you can't undo.

22:49.757 --> 22:52.093
Who says I want to?

22:52.426 --> 22:53.527
You were right, Greg.

22:53.529 --> 22:55.996
I want it all, and I want it with you.

22:55.998 --> 22:57.696
Why would I trust you now?

22:57.698 --> 22:58.597
Because I love you,

22:58.599 --> 23:02.567
and you have no idea what
Riley's planning to do to you.

23:02.569 --> 23:03.902
I'm listening.

23:03.904 --> 23:05.736
I have information that can stop her.

23:05.738 --> 23:07.738
It's better than the list.

23:07.740 --> 23:09.273
Why don't you come down to the club?

23:09.275 --> 23:10.406
We're auditioning new girls.

23:10.408 --> 23:14.177
There's no way I'm going
anywhere near Wild Nights.

23:14.179 --> 23:17.079
<i>Please, just come over.</i>

23:17.346 --> 23:18.380
I need you.

23:18.382 --> 23:21.583
And I want to show you how sorry I am...

23:21.585 --> 23:23.484
In private.

23:25.219 --> 23:27.320
I'll see you soon, Nik.

24:21.700 --> 24:22.898
Riley, is everything all right?

24:22.900 --> 24:25.433
Uh, yeah. Everything's fine.

24:25.435 --> 24:27.501
I was just thinking about
you and the kids. They okay?

24:27.503 --> 24:31.105
Yeah, they're fine. They're
doing their homework.

24:31.107 --> 24:31.672
Good.

24:31.674 --> 24:33.940
Please come home. Let's talk.

24:33.942 --> 24:36.009
Oh, yeah. I... I wish I could.

24:36.612 --> 24:37.676
I wouldn't even know where to start.

24:37.678 --> 24:41.080
Well, how about we start with
me telling you that I love you

24:41.082 --> 24:43.982
and that I'm here for
you no matter what?

24:44.083 --> 24:46.050
You have no idea how much that means

24:46.052 --> 24:47.017
to hear you say that right now.

24:47.019 --> 24:51.054
Well, it's true. You
can tell me anything.

24:52.589 --> 24:53.422
Yeah, um...

24:53.424 --> 24:57.125
I'm so sorry if I scared you last night,

24:57.127 --> 24:58.994
looking like a total crazy person.

24:58.996 --> 25:01.630
You can look however you want, Riley.

25:02.797 --> 25:05.031
Just tell me how I can help you.

25:05.366 --> 25:07.634
You know, the thing is, you can't.

25:07.636 --> 25:09.468
There must be something.

25:09.636 --> 25:12.271
You know what? There is.

25:12.273 --> 25:14.505
Just know how much I love you,

25:14.507 --> 25:16.208
and kiss the kids for me.

25:16.210 --> 25:19.909
<i>And I'll be home soon.</i>

25:35.491 --> 25:38.792
Come on, Nikki. Get him out of there.

25:42.763 --> 25:44.263
Girls are ready to audition.

25:44.265 --> 25:46.098
You sure you want me
to do this without you?

25:46.100 --> 25:47.899
You know what I like, Buddy.

25:47.901 --> 25:49.500
I got to go see Nikki.

25:49.502 --> 25:50.100
What's she want now?

25:50.102 --> 25:52.503
She's trying to crawl her way back in.

25:52.505 --> 25:55.638
Says she's got something on Riley Parks.

25:55.640 --> 25:57.840
I got all I need on Judge Overton.

25:57.842 --> 26:03.945
The man likes to be walked
on. I am so happy to oblige.

26:14.954 --> 26:19.524
Hey. Okay, get ready.
Carlyle is on his way.

27:08.165 --> 27:11.834
Ladies, welcome to
Amateur Audition Night.

27:11.836 --> 27:12.668
Sorry for the late start,

27:12.670 --> 27:17.239
but I see we have some very
promising newcomers here this evening.

27:17.241 --> 27:19.074
Mr. Carlyle can't be with us tonight,

27:19.076 --> 27:20.141
so I'll be interviewing you alone.

27:20.143 --> 27:23.276
You'll be called back to
the office one at a time.

27:23.278 --> 27:24.412
If I like what I see in there,

27:24.414 --> 27:27.080
I might just give you a shot out here.

27:28.181 --> 27:31.550
Okay, sugar, let's see what you got.

27:52.002 --> 27:54.102
You really let me down, Nikki.

27:54.104 --> 27:55.903
I know, and I'm sorry.

27:55.905 --> 27:57.804
But this drive will
more than make up for it.

27:57.806 --> 27:59.106
It's The Rub's financial statements

27:59.108 --> 28:02.474
for the last six months, and
not just the legit business.

28:02.476 --> 28:03.743
Client list financials.

28:03.745 --> 28:04.877
A lot of them use their credit cards

28:04.879 --> 28:06.044
to pay for the dirty stuff.

28:06.046 --> 28:07.578
Combine that with the
dates on the list...

28:07.580 --> 28:11.182
And everything you need to convict
those clients in a court of law.

28:11.184 --> 28:12.782
Not to mention blackmail them,

28:12.784 --> 28:15.585
or Riley, for anything you want.

28:15.853 --> 28:19.055
Very good, Nikki. When
did you get so clever?

28:19.057 --> 28:23.625
I've always been clever.
You just never noticed.

28:25.327 --> 28:26.728
Are you proud of me?

28:26.730 --> 28:28.495
Very proud.

28:28.497 --> 28:29.464
If this is legit.

28:29.466 --> 28:33.232
They're legit. I downloaded them myself.

28:38.437 --> 28:40.205
I hope so.

28:40.373 --> 28:43.742
'Cause you are so beautiful.

28:55.819 --> 28:59.521
Yes, sir. Got it. We'll stay alert.

29:00.389 --> 29:02.689
What took you so long?

29:02.691 --> 29:04.091
Got a call from Captain Reese.

29:04.093 --> 29:06.526
The raid in Galveston was a bust.

29:06.528 --> 29:07.893
Bust. I'll say.

29:07.895 --> 29:12.530
Dude, don't be an idiot.
We've got to stay sharp.

29:25.842 --> 29:27.343
Holly Breslow.

29:29.179 --> 29:30.945
You're up.

29:43.222 --> 29:45.924
Hello. Yes.

29:46.660 --> 29:50.428
Could I speak to Greg Carlyle?

29:50.495 --> 29:52.462
It's important.

29:52.997 --> 29:55.331
Dude, check out this stripper.

29:55.333 --> 29:57.966
Isn't that your
smoking-hot sister-in-law?

30:03.105 --> 30:06.708
So, uh, Holly...

30:06.710 --> 30:08.743
You are a pretty little thing.

30:08.745 --> 30:10.277
I haven't seen you on the circuit.

30:10.279 --> 30:12.012
Oh, I just moved here from Denver,

30:12.014 --> 30:14.247
so this is all new to me.

30:14.249 --> 30:15.014
You dance before?

30:15.016 --> 30:17.482
Not professionally, no.

30:17.484 --> 30:19.618
Pretty much just for my boyfriend.

30:19.620 --> 30:21.953
But, I promise that...

30:21.955 --> 30:24.189
You won't regret giving me a chance.

30:24.191 --> 30:25.522
Yeah?

30:25.524 --> 30:26.557
What makes you so different

30:26.559 --> 30:28.792
from all the other
girls that want a shot?

30:28.794 --> 30:30.560
I like men...

30:30.562 --> 30:33.763
And I really like men watching me.

30:34.331 --> 30:37.265
And I'm very cooperative...

30:37.267 --> 30:40.067
With management, if
you know what I mean.

30:40.069 --> 30:44.405
Well, I can tell you right now,
I'm gonna like looking at you.

30:44.805 --> 30:47.207
You're sweet.

30:47.209 --> 30:49.275
Why don't you show me your moves?

31:07.924 --> 31:12.526
I always wondered how she paid for
that house, all those nice clothes.

31:12.528 --> 31:13.528
Guess now we know.

31:13.530 --> 31:14.662
Not a word. I'm going in there.

31:14.664 --> 31:16.797
You're not! Hey! You'll blow our cover!

31:16.799 --> 31:20.133
Besides, it's not like
she's doing anything illegal.

31:45.188 --> 31:48.556
Buddy, we got a problem.

31:48.558 --> 31:50.524
Well, take care of it. I'm busy.

31:50.526 --> 31:52.792
You're gonna want to take this.

31:54.163 --> 31:57.862
Woman from the police department
needs to talk to Carlyle.

31:57.864 --> 31:59.365
I told her you were in charge.

31:59.367 --> 32:02.066
Says it's time-sensitive.

32:03.903 --> 32:04.536
Who's this?

32:04.538 --> 32:05.702
A friend from the department,

32:05.704 --> 32:07.970
but I need to speak to Greg Carlyle.

32:07.972 --> 32:08.772
I don't talk to just anyone.

32:08.774 --> 32:11.073
Well, you got me. What do you want?

32:11.075 --> 32:14.010
You might want to be
polite to an officer

32:14.012 --> 32:17.112
who's doing your boss a favor.

32:17.114 --> 32:17.845
Now, in 10 minutes,

32:17.847 --> 32:20.915
you are gonna be covered in INS agents.

32:20.917 --> 32:23.216
<i>If I were you, I would
get Tatianna, Valeria,</i>

32:23.218 --> 32:26.786
Irina, and whatever girls
of questionable status

32:26.788 --> 32:28.922
out of there, and pretty damn quick.

32:28.924 --> 32:29.988
How do you know about our girls?

32:29.990 --> 32:35.393
I give you information. You
don't ask questions. 10 minutes.

32:36.029 --> 32:38.763
Get the imported girls out of here now.

32:38.864 --> 32:41.298
Excuse me, darling. I got
to take care of something.

32:41.300 --> 32:44.000
Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.

32:44.002 --> 32:45.901
Can't wait.

32:45.903 --> 32:48.671
Thank you, Georgia.

32:53.041 --> 32:55.676
Riley, what the hell are you doing?

33:34.041 --> 33:37.075
No, no, no! This can't be good.

33:37.610 --> 33:40.111
She's headed back into the club.

33:42.680 --> 33:45.816
Something's wrong. I'm
going to go get her.

33:45.818 --> 33:47.416
Evan!

33:53.122 --> 33:54.490
The imported girls are clear.

33:54.492 --> 33:58.058
Good. Now help get everyone else out.

34:10.536 --> 34:11.937
Oh, God.

34:17.376 --> 34:20.143
What the hell has your
sister-in-law got herself into?

34:20.145 --> 34:23.580
I don't know, but I got to find out.

34:23.581 --> 34:24.481
Go on. I got your back.

34:24.483 --> 34:27.748
And no one sees that
surveillance tape. No one!

34:27.751 --> 34:28.884
I got it. Go!

34:33.422 --> 34:35.121
So, what do you think?

34:35.123 --> 34:35.922
These files are legit.

34:35.925 --> 34:39.025
Of course they're legit.
What else would they be?

34:39.027 --> 34:42.560
I don't know. You confuse me.

34:43.062 --> 34:44.763
What do you mean, baby?

34:44.764 --> 34:46.398
I've always been on your side.

34:46.400 --> 34:49.733
It's so hard to tell with you.

34:49.900 --> 34:52.802
I'm not gonna hurt you, Greg.

34:53.271 --> 34:55.103
I love you.

35:04.646 --> 35:05.646
What is it, Buddy?

35:05.648 --> 35:06.781
We got a problem.

35:06.783 --> 35:08.683
Your mole called from the department.

35:08.685 --> 35:10.684
Warned us about an INS raid.

35:10.686 --> 35:11.284
What did he say?

35:11.286 --> 35:13.720
It wasn't a dude. It was a lady.

35:13.722 --> 35:16.488
Well, if it was some lady,
then it wasn't our dude.

35:16.490 --> 35:17.655
Well, how was I supposed to know?

35:17.657 --> 35:19.325
I was auditioning this
girl in your office,

35:19.327 --> 35:21.259
and I got pulled out
on an emergency call.

35:21.261 --> 35:24.128
You left a girl alone in my office?

35:24.130 --> 35:27.530
Well, yeah, but... Nothing's gone.

35:27.532 --> 35:29.532
Check the safe.

35:33.002 --> 35:34.803
She got the list and your gun.

35:34.805 --> 35:36.538
<i>Boss, I'm sorry.</i>

35:37.940 --> 35:39.873
Everything okay, baby?

35:39.875 --> 35:42.275
No, baby. But it will be.

35:42.277 --> 35:46.079
Tell me where Mrs. Parks took that list.

35:46.081 --> 35:47.512
I don't know what you're talking abo...

35:47.514 --> 35:50.148
Tell me.

35:50.283 --> 35:52.049
Tell me.

35:54.488 --> 35:58.191
All right, guys, dinner is served!

35:58.592 --> 35:59.358
This isn't mac and cheese.

35:59.360 --> 36:03.228
Yeah, well, it's mac. And Daddy ran out
of cheese, so I used a little ketchup.

36:03.230 --> 36:04.062
When's Mom gonna be back?

36:04.064 --> 36:06.965
Well, she's gonna be back
before you know it, baby girl.

36:06.967 --> 36:08.899
In fact, I bet that's
her calling right now.

36:08.901 --> 36:11.969
Now, eat your peas,
you two. I'm serious.

36:13.605 --> 36:14.337
Evan, what's up?

36:14.339 --> 36:16.405
Kyle, you're right. We got
to put our differences aside

36:16.407 --> 36:18.607
if we're gonna help
Riley. She's in trouble.

36:18.609 --> 36:19.909
Hold on. What's going on?

36:19.911 --> 36:21.476
Listen. I don't have time
to explain, but it's bad.

36:21.478 --> 36:23.711
Wait, what are you... Where is she now?

36:23.713 --> 36:24.980
I'm following her to Sugar Land.

36:24.982 --> 36:28.881
I'm pretty sure she's on her way to
The Rub. You need to get there now.

36:28.883 --> 36:30.284
All right.

36:32.486 --> 36:33.852
I don't know what you fed him.

36:33.854 --> 36:34.887
Formula, Dale. Okay, but...

36:34.889 --> 36:36.722
No formula I know smells like that.

36:36.724 --> 36:38.823
Oh, really? Thank you, Dale. I'm
just telling you what it smells like.

36:38.825 --> 36:40.659
How I am gonna change him
when we're driving? Hello?

36:40.661 --> 36:43.294
Yeah, Dale, it's me. Hey, man.

36:43.296 --> 36:45.062
Um, I am exhausted.

36:45.064 --> 36:47.664
I don't even know what street
I'm driving on right now.

36:47.666 --> 36:49.598
How fast can you guys get over here?

36:49.600 --> 36:50.966
<i>She's in trouble.</i>

36:50.968 --> 36:53.202
What, Riley? Is she okay?

36:53.204 --> 36:54.402
What is it? What's going on?

36:54.404 --> 36:58.538
I only have patience for our screaming bundle
of joy back there, so do not wave me off.

36:58.540 --> 37:00.541
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, you know what?

37:00.543 --> 37:01.675
Kyle, I'm gonna put
you on speaker, buddy.

37:01.677 --> 37:02.709
It's okay, Cole.

37:02.711 --> 37:06.012
Sorry. Hey, Kyle, it's me.
How ca... How can we help?

37:06.014 --> 37:07.079
<i>Can you guys    watch the kids?</i>

37:07.081 --> 37:11.182
<i>I don't know what's going on,
but I need to find Riley.</i>

37:13.285 --> 37:14.551
Yeah, uh, yeah. Of course.

37:14.553 --> 37:17.254
Of course. We'll be right there.

37:18.923 --> 37:19.555
What was that?

37:19.557 --> 37:22.291
I thought you said things were
broken between you and Riley.

37:22.293 --> 37:23.226
Dale, I say a lot of things.

37:23.228 --> 37:24.661
You don't have to pay
attention to all of them.

37:24.663 --> 37:27.796
Okay. Does that mean I have the
permission to ignore you? Shh.

37:27.798 --> 37:30.098
Look, I am very angry with
my best friend. Mmm-hmm.

37:30.100 --> 37:33.566
It doesn't mean we're not
best friends, okay? Mmm-hmm.

37:33.568 --> 37:36.169
Oh, was I supposed to hear that,
or was I supposed to ignore it?

37:36.171 --> 37:38.071
I'm just trying to keep things straight.

37:38.839 --> 37:42.708
I'll just drive. Just
driving Miss Crazy.

37:46.078 --> 37:47.879
Hey, Georgia, it's me, okay.

37:47.881 --> 37:50.615
I made it out of Wild
Nights. I got the client list.

37:50.617 --> 37:51.648
Everything's under control.

37:51.650 --> 37:55.118
And as far as that exit
strategy we were talking about,

37:55.120 --> 37:56.285
don't you worry.

37:56.287 --> 37:57.687
Greg Carlyle is gonna be history.

37:57.689 --> 38:01.890
And you and I, our
futures will be insured.

38:02.024 --> 38:04.058
Okay. Bye.

38:35.352 --> 38:38.086
Hand over the list, Mrs. Parks.

38:38.088 --> 38:39.721
I don't want to hurt you.

38:39.723 --> 38:40.154
Oh, yeah?

38:40.156 --> 38:42.456
Just like you didn't mean
to hurt my best friend, huh?

38:42.458 --> 38:45.958
Just like you didn't mean to
threaten Nikki so she'd spy on me?

38:45.960 --> 38:47.893
Nikki was a sweet girl.

38:47.895 --> 38:51.029
But she was in way
over her head. Not you.

38:51.031 --> 38:54.064
You know exactly what you're doing.

38:54.066 --> 38:55.734
You got balls!

39:02.172 --> 39:02.905
Okay, look.

39:02.907 --> 39:05.742
I'm just a mom, okay, with two kids.

39:05.744 --> 39:07.776
And I got in all this, and
I don't know how to get out.

39:07.778 --> 39:10.712
But none of this was
ever supposed to happen.

39:10.714 --> 39:12.446
Just give me the list, Mrs. Parks,

39:12.448 --> 39:14.648
or you and everyone
you love are going down.

39:14.650 --> 39:19.251
No, you see, that is
never, ever gonna happen.

39:19.385 --> 39:20.687
No!

39:39.870 --> 39:41.236
Riley!

39:42.838 --> 39:45.073
You're bleeding.

40:11.961 --> 40:13.895
I can explain.
