00:06.966 --> 00:09.298
(theme music playing )

00:18.102 --> 00:20.718
( men fighting )

00:23.399 --> 00:25.139
Argh!

00:25.318 --> 00:26.808
Aw fuck!

00:26.986 --> 00:29.193
Two weeks and the mark's still
raw as a whore's cunt.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.979
Eh, I bear
the same mark, brother,

00:32.158 --> 00:33.773
without pissing about it.

00:33.951 --> 00:35.202
Ha ha ha ha!

00:53.763 --> 00:56.220
You lower your guard
after each assault.

00:56.390 --> 00:57.926
I shall see it raised then.

01:07.026 --> 01:08.766
(yells)

01:12.531 --> 01:14.032
Your head is mine.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.441
How shall I mount it?

01:18.663 --> 01:20.199
You move well today.

01:20.373 --> 01:23.536
You do not.
What distracts you?

01:23.709 --> 01:27.793
I had Ashur send a letter
to Aurelia.

01:27.964 --> 01:29.545
A week passed now,
and no reply.

01:29.715 --> 01:32.798
You expect different?

01:32.969 --> 01:36.086
A woman seldom rushes back
to the husband who calls her a whore.

01:36.264 --> 01:38.346
I said no such thing.

01:38.516 --> 01:40.472
Not in words.
The letter was contrite.

01:40.643 --> 01:43.726
I admitted l reacted poorly
to the news of her being with child.

01:43.896 --> 01:45.511
And now she makes you wait--

01:45.690 --> 01:49.148
the way women punish us
for being fools.

01:49.318 --> 01:51.354
Strike it from your mind

01:51.529 --> 01:53.986
or find your brains
upon the sand.

01:58.369 --> 02:00.030
Licinia:
These are exquisite.

02:00.204 --> 02:02.991
Yes, they've been in the family
for generations.

02:03.165 --> 02:06.157
So this sort of arrangement
happens often?

02:06.335 --> 02:08.792
- No.
-Hmm.

02:08.963 --> 02:10.453
But when such a request
is made,

02:10.631 --> 02:13.373
one must be prepared to offer
only the finest quality.

02:13.551 --> 02:17.590
The House of Batiatus does not
fall short in that regard.

02:22.977 --> 02:24.183
This one, I think.

02:24.353 --> 02:28.266
Ah, Diana,
the goddess of the hunt--

02:28.441 --> 02:29.851
a fine choice.

02:42.788 --> 02:44.164
Do you think
she would approve?

02:44.332 --> 02:46.163
When Actaeon
saw her bathing,

02:46.334 --> 02:47.949
she turned the poor bastard
into a stag

02:48.127 --> 02:49.742
and set his own dogs
upon him.

02:49.920 --> 02:51.581
Oh, how fitting then

02:51.756 --> 02:54.088
that you should have
a stag of your own to play with.

02:54.258 --> 02:55.623
Have you decided?

02:55.801 --> 02:57.507
There is only one man

02:57.678 --> 02:59.543
lwould invite such peril
to know.

02:59.722 --> 03:01.758
I will have Spartacus.

03:01.932 --> 03:04.969
The champion.

03:05.144 --> 03:06.975
Of course.

03:08.397 --> 03:11.639
Is that a problem?
If more coin is required--

03:11.817 --> 03:13.148
No no no no no.

03:13.319 --> 03:14.980
No, the cousin
to Marcus Crassus

03:15.154 --> 03:17.315
deserves the slayer
of Theokoles himself,

03:17.490 --> 03:19.321
at fair price.

03:19.492 --> 03:23.155
Oh, it is not the price
that concerns.

03:23.329 --> 03:25.615
Psst

03:25.790 --> 03:27.746
If ever my husband
were to hear of this...

03:27.917 --> 03:30.579
The gods themselves
would have to whisper it in his ear.

03:30.753 --> 03:32.664
We take the utmost care

03:32.838 --> 03:35.124
with the delicate nature
of these arrangements.

03:35.299 --> 03:37.631
The mask ensures
anonymity,

03:37.802 --> 03:39.633
but you must do your part.

03:39.804 --> 03:41.669
Tell no one.

03:41.847 --> 03:44.759
Arrive exactly
at the appointed time,

03:44.934 --> 03:46.219
unencumbered.

03:46.394 --> 03:49.261
Absent slaves or attendants?

03:49.438 --> 03:52.771
Who would hold your husband's
loyalty true to value.

03:52.942 --> 03:57.106
I would avoid complications
for you and this ludus.

03:57.279 --> 03:58.780
||ithyia.

04:00.032 --> 04:01.238
Oh.

04:01.409 --> 04:04.776
Apologies. Am I early?

04:04.954 --> 04:06.694
For what purpose?

04:06.872 --> 04:09.249
You invited me
to midday meal.

04:09.417 --> 04:12.500
- Did you?
- Yes. For tomorrow.

04:12.670 --> 04:15.207
Oh, was it?
( chuckles )

04:15.381 --> 04:18.919
I pray I have not interrupted
important proceedings.

04:19.093 --> 04:21.209
Oh no, on the contrary.

04:21.387 --> 04:24.174
We were only just speaking
about you and your gladiator.

04:24.348 --> 04:26.885
What was his name?
The Celt...

04:27.059 --> 04:29.766
- Segovax.
- Yes, Segovax.

04:29.937 --> 04:32.724
Pity. Perhaps you should
buy several next time

04:32.898 --> 04:35.230
until you get the hang of it.

04:35.401 --> 04:37.107
It's a very difficult process.

04:37.278 --> 04:39.564
Very few make it
to the final test,

04:39.738 --> 04:41.353
still fewer the arena.

04:41.532 --> 04:43.318
My husband demands
only the finest.

04:43.492 --> 04:45.483
As do we all.

04:47.580 --> 04:50.242
Forgive my haste,
but my own husband expects me.

04:52.835 --> 04:54.871
I look forward
to our next encounter.

05:02.553 --> 05:04.043
She favors you.

05:04.221 --> 05:05.631
And | her.

05:07.057 --> 05:09.969
lt warms the heart
to know my hands are responsible.

05:10.144 --> 05:13.762
Then let me take them
in gratitude.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.812
You should be more careful

05:22.990 --> 05:24.981
with Licinia.

05:25.159 --> 05:27.491
She's of a strata
above your station

05:27.661 --> 05:29.447
and will not hesitate
to remind you of it

05:29.622 --> 05:31.112
the minute her mood shifts.

05:31.290 --> 05:34.248
And it shifts frequently.

05:34.418 --> 05:38.127
I am well versed
in dealing with such people.

05:39.548 --> 05:41.539
Of course you are.

05:43.969 --> 05:46.881
So am | to be invited?

05:48.474 --> 05:51.136
Invited? To what?

05:51.310 --> 05:53.596
To the masquerade.

05:53.771 --> 05:56.979
You think I did not notice the mask
she was attempting to conceal?

05:57.149 --> 05:58.559
You're mistaken.

05:58.734 --> 06:01.146
There is no masquerade.

06:01.320 --> 06:04.062
She merely wanted to borrow
the visage of Diana.

06:04.240 --> 06:06.026
To avoid complications?

06:07.326 --> 06:10.864
A wealthy woman of status
visiting a ludus,

06:11.038 --> 06:15.031
concealing masks
and whispering of complications--

06:15.209 --> 06:17.871
if I did not know better,

06:18.045 --> 06:20.536
I would suspect intent

06:20.714 --> 06:23.376
to fuck
one of your gladiators.

06:23.551 --> 06:25.667
- ||ithyia.
- She is, isn't she?

06:25.844 --> 06:29.883
Oh, that little whore.
How positively depraved.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.422
I promised discretion.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.216
You must not breathe
a word of this to anyone.

06:34.395 --> 06:37.603
I would never think it.

06:39.066 --> 06:42.024
You have been
a most valued friend.

06:42.194 --> 06:44.651
And this will be

06:44.822 --> 06:47.985
our little secret.

06:50.578 --> 06:52.660
Lucretia:
I can control her.

06:52.830 --> 06:54.491
||ithyia?

06:54.665 --> 06:56.656
Like you did
with her and Segovax?

06:56.834 --> 06:59.120
She had her own man
make attempt on Spartacus

06:59.295 --> 07:01.536
under our very roof,
and you yet speak of control.

07:01.714 --> 07:04.205
Spartacus inflames her
beyond reason.

07:04.383 --> 07:06.749
Licinia is a different matter.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.758
Even ||ithyia
has sense enough

07:08.929 --> 07:11.090
to fear reprisal from the cousin
of Marcus Crassus.

07:11.265 --> 07:13.881
As she should.

07:14.059 --> 07:16.345
That man shits gold.

07:16.520 --> 07:20.138
To have the favor
of such an ally in Rome

07:20.316 --> 07:22.477
could pave my way
to a seat in the curia.

07:22.651 --> 07:25.768
There is one small obstacle.

07:26.947 --> 07:30.110
Licinia favors
the touch of our champion.

07:30.284 --> 07:33.902
Spartacus?
That will not be difficult.

07:34.079 --> 07:37.367
- Oh, he's always difficult.
- In a past that no longer exists.

07:37.541 --> 07:39.406
I shall command

07:39.585 --> 07:41.746
and it shall be done.

07:44.506 --> 07:48.044
Ah, the champion of Capua
arrives,

07:48.218 --> 07:51.881
a man
who so terrifies Jupiter,

07:52.056 --> 07:55.423
the clouds burst
and the heavens weep.

07:55.601 --> 07:59.014
My glory is but a reflection
of my dominus.

07:59.188 --> 08:01.850
- You flatter.
- | return in kind.

08:02.024 --> 08:04.436
And the gods take notice.

08:04.610 --> 08:06.771
Just when I thought
we'd accrued every accolade,

08:06.945 --> 08:09.561
yet another falls in our laps
from the heavens.

08:09.740 --> 08:12.527
Fair Licinia,
cousin to Marcus Crassus himself,

08:12.701 --> 08:14.487
has personally
requested you.

08:14.662 --> 08:18.029
- Crassus?
- The richest man in the republic.

08:21.418 --> 08:23.955
A great honor.

08:26.799 --> 08:28.414
Who's to be my opponent?

08:28.592 --> 08:30.583
Opponent?

08:30.761 --> 08:33.548
Licinia has no interest
in watching you fight.

08:33.722 --> 08:36.964
Her desires are of a more
intimate nature.

08:39.144 --> 08:40.520
I am to lie with her?

08:40.688 --> 08:43.475
And shame all men who follow.

08:44.983 --> 08:47.269
Such things are asked
of a champion?

08:47.444 --> 08:50.811
They are.
You have concern?

08:53.909 --> 08:56.195
No.

08:57.996 --> 09:01.124
lam the champion of Capua.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.873
I shall perform all duties
required of me.

09:05.587 --> 09:08.294
Bring her to satisfaction

09:08.465 --> 09:11.457
and see our fortunes rise
along with your cock.

09:12.678 --> 09:14.760
Is there discomfort?

09:14.930 --> 09:17.512
None.

09:17.683 --> 09:19.844
When can I return to training?

09:20.018 --> 09:22.930
The fact that you walk among the living
is a marvel in itself.

09:23.105 --> 09:25.187
How long?

09:25.357 --> 09:28.349
A week, maybe two.

09:30.154 --> 09:31.610
Tomorrow.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.441
No, it is much too soon.

09:35.868 --> 09:38.280
Tomorrow.

09:38.454 --> 09:40.194
Tomorrow then.

09:40.372 --> 09:43.660
Ashur: A glorious day,
long in the coming--

09:43.834 --> 09:46.416
Crixus risen from the dead

09:46.587 --> 09:49.829
and Ashur finally freed
of his shackles

09:50.007 --> 09:51.338
to take up sword again.

09:51.508 --> 09:55.376
You would resume training
as a gladiator?

09:56.430 --> 09:58.386
l yet bear the mark

09:58.557 --> 10:01.765
and long to stand with my brothers
once more

10:01.935 --> 10:04.472
upon the sands
of the arena.

10:04.646 --> 10:06.602
Perhaps this time
you will have the sense

10:06.774 --> 10:08.730
to stay out of my way.

10:08.901 --> 10:11.392
(Crixus laughing )

10:12.654 --> 10:14.519
(spits)

10:14.698 --> 10:17.610
Take this fucking thing
off me,

10:17.785 --> 10:19.901
now.

10:27.753 --> 10:29.584
He gave you no pause?

10:29.755 --> 10:31.586
None.

10:31.757 --> 10:35.670
Our dog is finally
housebroken.

10:37.387 --> 10:39.093
You were wise

10:39.264 --> 10:41.846
to put down his bitch.

10:42.017 --> 10:43.382
(groaning)

10:43.560 --> 10:45.767
(howling)

10:45.938 --> 10:47.644
Shh.

10:50.943 --> 10:52.979
Leave.

10:53.153 --> 10:56.111
And send in some wine.

10:59.785 --> 11:01.992
Everything comes to plan.

11:03.288 --> 11:06.655
We shall have
Licinia's wet gratitude,

11:06.834 --> 11:09.701
and with it
the ear of Marcus Crassus.

11:09.878 --> 11:12.369
lf Spartacus performs
as promised.

11:12.548 --> 11:15.756
Every breath he takes is in service
to the glory of this house.

11:15.926 --> 11:17.632
I know he's willing,

11:17.803 --> 11:20.590
but it's been many months
since he last lay with a woman.

11:20.764 --> 11:22.425
After such a time,

11:22.599 --> 11:26.262
his passion might be
all too brief.

11:26.436 --> 11:28.301
Well, that would be
unfortunate.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.222
Yet easily avoidable,
if Spartacus is presented

11:31.400 --> 11:34.107
opportunity to hone his skills
beforehand.

11:49.251 --> 11:50.787
You have wandered
to the wrong cell.

11:50.961 --> 11:54.044
Are you not Spartacus,

11:54.214 --> 11:57.001
bringer of rain?

11:59.177 --> 12:01.259
lam Mira.

12:01.430 --> 12:03.386
l have been sent
to please you.

12:03.557 --> 12:05.343
To what end?

12:07.352 --> 12:09.343
Is your pleasure
not an end to itself?

12:09.521 --> 12:13.309
I do not care for games.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.690
Give your true purpose.

12:19.615 --> 12:21.731
Find your tongue.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.745
Domina fears

12:25.913 --> 12:29.030
that you've been
too long without a woman,

12:29.207 --> 12:31.198
that you will be unable
to withhold your seed

12:31.376 --> 12:33.537
long enough to please
the Roman woman.

12:33.712 --> 12:36.749
The notion offends me,

12:36.924 --> 12:39.290
as does your presence.

12:46.058 --> 12:47.673
You do not desire me?

12:47.851 --> 12:50.217
I desire only sleep...

12:51.730 --> 12:53.641
and the absence of dreams.

13:26.932 --> 13:28.513
Gods grant me strength

13:28.684 --> 13:30.720
to rip these fucking bars
from their moorings.

13:30.894 --> 13:33.135
We were fools
to think they favor us.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.928
We yet share a roof.

13:35.107 --> 13:37.098
It would not have happened
if Dominus had sold me.

13:37.275 --> 13:39.687
Is that not proof
that our union is favored?

13:39.861 --> 13:43.979
To have you
but not have you--

13:44.157 --> 13:47.115
it is a wound
beyond healing.

13:48.912 --> 13:51.369
All wounds heal,

13:51.540 --> 13:52.905
even the deepest.

13:53.083 --> 13:55.574
Would that they had never
been inflicted.

13:55.752 --> 13:58.414
You would wish
never to have known my heart?

13:58.588 --> 14:00.499
( rustling )

14:00.674 --> 14:03.416
( gates creak )

14:17.649 --> 14:18.855
( men cheering )

14:19.026 --> 14:20.687
Men: Welcome, Crixus.
Welcome back.

14:22.154 --> 14:24.896
The Undefeated Gaul returns.

14:25.907 --> 14:28.489
Perhaps it is time
he chose a new name.

14:30.746 --> 14:32.611
Crixus.

14:32.789 --> 14:35.405
My spirit soars to see you again
upon the sands.

14:35.584 --> 14:37.290
The underworld
would not have me.

14:38.795 --> 14:40.046
Take note.

14:40.213 --> 14:44.752
A true champion
rejoins the brotherhood.

14:44.926 --> 14:48.089
Champion of ass and balls.

14:48.263 --> 14:51.346
(rhythmic pounding)

14:59.024 --> 15:02.107
Has there ever been
such a man as Crixus?

15:02.277 --> 15:05.690
No, Domina.
There has not.

15:06.740 --> 15:08.605
Praise the gods
for his return.

15:08.784 --> 15:10.649
May they guide him
to many more victories.

15:10.827 --> 15:14.365
And our purse filled by such.

15:14.539 --> 15:18.452
Yes, filled to bursting.

15:18.627 --> 15:20.538
You will spar with Duro.

15:20.712 --> 15:22.668
The German?

15:22.839 --> 15:24.921
He has yet to set foot
in the arena.

15:25.092 --> 15:27.128
And you have been
long absent.

15:27.302 --> 15:30.419
Prove yourself against the man
and see advancement.

15:30.597 --> 15:33.213
Ashur: And who shall
face Ashur?

15:33.391 --> 15:38.010
( men laugh )

15:40.315 --> 15:41.930
Choose carefully,

15:42.109 --> 15:45.226
for I long for blood.

15:45.403 --> 15:47.894
- Doctore: You train?
- I do.

15:48.073 --> 15:49.654
By whose word?

15:49.825 --> 15:52.692
The dominus himself promised
that I would rejoin the brotherhood

15:52.869 --> 15:55.656
once I was freed
from the fucking brace.

15:55.831 --> 15:57.867
Batiatus: Ashur.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.118
A word.

16:02.295 --> 16:05.128
( laughs )
The master calls his dog.

16:06.967 --> 16:07.001
What of my victory
over Hasdrubal?

16:07.008 --> 16:09.044
What of my victory
over Hasdrubal?

16:09.219 --> 16:11.255
How the crowd roared
when l cleaved his head in two!

16:11.429 --> 16:14.091
- A minor victory, long forgotten.
- Kleitos then, or Lysimachus.

16:14.266 --> 16:16.473
All long ago.
Your days as a gladiator are past.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.474
Dominus.

16:20.105 --> 16:22.266
I beg of you,

16:22.440 --> 16:25.022
let me prove myself
yet worthy.

16:25.193 --> 16:28.526
You already have,
outside of the arena.

16:28.697 --> 16:31.234
Your cunning is sharper
than any gladiator's sword.

16:31.408 --> 16:34.320
I would not risk it
on errands of foolish pride.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.655
Are we in agreement?

16:37.664 --> 16:39.996
Your will, Dominus.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.624
To business then.
I have had thoughts toward Solonius

16:42.794 --> 16:44.910
I would discuss
on the way to market.

17:03.857 --> 17:06.348
Did you note
any signs of discomfort

17:06.526 --> 17:09.063
as Crixus took the sand?

17:09.237 --> 17:11.979
- No, Domina.
- Huh.

17:12.157 --> 17:14.364
He's anxious
to regain his place.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.399
But I would not
see him overreach,

17:16.578 --> 17:19.115
nor hide pain
from his recovery.

17:19.289 --> 17:22.201
If you notice Crixus attempting
to conceal anything from me,

17:22.375 --> 17:24.115
you tell me immediately.

17:24.294 --> 17:25.909
Yes, Domina.

17:26.087 --> 17:29.671
The opposite sex has no sense whatever
when it comes to their limits.

17:29.841 --> 17:32.628
They must be constantly watched
lest they harm themselves

17:32.802 --> 17:35.589
in the simple act of being men.

17:35.764 --> 17:38.221
Wait.

17:42.479 --> 17:44.310
Domina.

17:44.481 --> 17:46.517
How did you fare
with Spartacus last night?

17:46.691 --> 17:49.808
Was his cock of impressive size
when engorged?

17:49.986 --> 17:53.854
How many times
did he have you?

17:54.032 --> 17:55.238
Huh?

17:57.369 --> 17:59.030
Speak.

18:00.538 --> 18:02.199
He would not have me.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.703
- He would not?
- No, Domina.

18:06.878 --> 18:09.255
And yet you wait until now
to tell me?

18:09.422 --> 18:11.162
l was afraid
you would be displeased.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.799
Take off your dress.

18:25.897 --> 18:29.310
Tits, ass and cunt all appear
to be without disease or deformity,

18:29.484 --> 18:33.102
which tells me the fault
is not in the flesh

18:33.280 --> 18:35.191
but in the bitch.

18:35.365 --> 18:37.026
Apologies, Domina.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.316
Return to his cell tonight,

18:39.494 --> 18:42.327
and I expect his cock in you,

18:42.497 --> 18:45.955
or you'll find a sword
in its place.

19:05.979 --> 19:07.765
This isn't the arena.

19:07.939 --> 19:10.100
The world is my arena, pup.

19:22.287 --> 19:24.528
Send me a man.

19:38.470 --> 19:40.461
Stand down!

19:41.473 --> 19:43.805
Agron.

19:43.975 --> 19:45.715
Duro.

19:45.894 --> 19:47.259
Enough.

19:48.813 --> 19:50.974
Half rations
for the remainder of the week.

19:51.149 --> 19:53.390
Test my patience again

19:53.568 --> 19:56.310
and I'll see you both
to the mines.

19:57.989 --> 20:00.105
Crixus continues
making friends.

20:03.953 --> 20:06.205
Spartacus:
Yet no word from your wife?

20:06.373 --> 20:08.830
None forthcoming,

20:09.000 --> 20:11.332
and no more coin to pay Ashur
for the service of letters.

20:11.503 --> 20:13.368
You will dishonor us

20:13.546 --> 20:15.082
if your mind is not
on the games.

20:15.256 --> 20:17.838
Tell the jackal
I will cover the cost.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.671
I will repay you.

20:20.845 --> 20:22.301
Quickly,

20:22.472 --> 20:24.428
before he departs.

20:25.517 --> 20:28.304
Ashur.

20:28.478 --> 20:30.844
Your man has run afoot.

20:31.022 --> 20:33.729
Perhaps you'd care
for a real opponent.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.357
Are you so eager
to return to the medicus?

20:36.528 --> 20:39.440
Crixus, you are summoned.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.491
Soon.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.993
(groaning loudly)

20:55.922 --> 20:58.709
Get off.

21:01.386 --> 21:04.128
Tarry a while.

21:05.473 --> 21:08.055
Your master's yet at market

21:08.226 --> 21:11.138
and ||ithyia's not expected
for several hours.

21:11.312 --> 21:13.519
Oh.

21:17.485 --> 21:20.147
Is my skin not soft?

21:20.321 --> 21:22.698
Yes, Domina.

21:22.866 --> 21:24.572
I had the slaves draw
a milk bath,

21:24.742 --> 21:26.573
recalling a time
when it pleased you

21:26.744 --> 21:29.611
that we could afford
such things.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.905
Oh.

21:32.083 --> 21:33.869
Does it yet cause pain?

21:34.043 --> 21:36.125
No, Domina.

21:36.296 --> 21:38.787
| wish I could say the same.

21:38.965 --> 21:41.081
It was torture
to see such perfection

21:41.259 --> 21:42.965
marred by Theokoles.

21:44.387 --> 21:46.628
When you fell to your knees

21:46.806 --> 21:48.467
and the giant was
at your back...

21:48.641 --> 21:51.474
my heart seized in my chest.

21:52.604 --> 21:56.142
Then you looked up
to the pulvinus,

21:56.316 --> 21:57.806
to me.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.565
What was of your mind,

21:59.736 --> 22:02.478
in that frozen moment
between life and death?

22:02.655 --> 22:05.613
(thunder crashing )

22:05.783 --> 22:08.616
l welcomed the afterlife

22:08.786 --> 22:13.029
having known
the love of a goddess.

22:18.630 --> 22:21.918
You will always be mine,
Crixus,

22:22.091 --> 22:24.548
mine alone.

22:26.638 --> 22:26.672
(shouting )

22:26.679 --> 22:29.136
(shouting )

22:36.689 --> 22:39.977
Five sacks
for the price of 10.

22:40.151 --> 22:42.312
See to it they are dryer
this time, shit hole.

22:42.487 --> 22:44.443
The last ones
stank of mold.

22:44.614 --> 22:46.980
Do not churn, good Solonius.

22:48.159 --> 22:51.196
The thief will suffer when prices
plummet with the next harvest.

22:51.371 --> 22:54.329
I pray his cock
follows the decline.

22:55.875 --> 22:58.036
You are left off leash?

22:58.211 --> 23:00.293
My master is to his villa.

23:00.463 --> 23:04.923
l yet have business
to attend

23:05.093 --> 23:08.756
and words
searching for receptive ears.

23:11.558 --> 23:13.799
My situation has shifted.

23:13.977 --> 23:15.683
And with it your loyalties?

23:15.853 --> 23:19.721
Batiatus proves himself unworthy,
as you had divined.

23:19.899 --> 23:23.187
Such base character seldom weighs
the true worth of a man.

23:23.361 --> 23:25.522
I take it your scales are
more in balance.

23:26.573 --> 23:29.360
I hold valuable news,
beyond the meager recompense

23:29.534 --> 23:31.240
you offered
when last we spoke.

23:31.411 --> 23:33.117
l'm surrounded by jackals.

23:33.288 --> 23:35.279
It concerns your life.

23:36.541 --> 23:39.954
If that is no cause for you
to loosen your purse...

23:42.672 --> 23:44.458
Wait.

23:53.057 --> 23:56.641
You have picked my bones clean.
Speak before I reclaim the meat.

23:56.811 --> 23:59.553
You fuck the whore Desponia
on this night every week, do you not?

23:59.731 --> 24:02.723
You voice what is already
well known to me.

24:02.900 --> 24:05.516
Hmm. Send another cock
in your place

24:05.695 --> 24:08.232
or see it removed
along with your head.

24:09.240 --> 24:11.356
Batiatus moves against me?

24:11.534 --> 24:14.901
I am to pay his agent
and see the order given.

24:16.873 --> 24:18.659
You've been warned.

24:23.504 --> 24:25.961
I really cannot believe
the difference.

24:26.132 --> 24:30.421
When I first visited your home,
I felt great sorrow

24:30.595 --> 24:33.758
for the woman forced to live
in such conditions.

24:33.931 --> 24:35.922
Now look at you,

24:36.100 --> 24:38.011
surrounded by opulence

24:38.186 --> 24:40.973
rivaling families
of proper heritage.

24:41.147 --> 24:43.388
Trinkets merely,

24:43.566 --> 24:47.605
not nearly so valuable
as your friendship.

24:49.113 --> 24:52.105
You have many
new friends of late.

24:52.283 --> 24:55.571
You and Licinia seem
quite at ease with one another.

24:55.745 --> 24:58.737
Gratitude for
the introduction.

24:58.915 --> 25:00.780
Would you care
for some wine or...?

25:00.958 --> 25:03.825
Wine will not
still my thoughts.

25:06.964 --> 25:11.207
l prattle on
with pleasantries, but...

25:13.429 --> 25:16.762
I cannot pretend indifference
to what you revealed about Licinia.

25:16.933 --> 25:21.142
l revealed nothing.
You jumped to conclusions.

25:21.312 --> 25:24.054
And landed
on proper footing.

25:25.608 --> 25:27.724
Ever since,

25:27.902 --> 25:29.984
I can think of nothing else.

25:31.489 --> 25:33.650
With respect,

25:33.825 --> 25:37.488
Licinia's passions
are her own concern.

25:39.414 --> 25:42.497
My mind falls not
to Licinia.

25:44.127 --> 25:46.288
It is filled
with baser thoughts--

25:46.462 --> 25:50.922
the vision of brutish hands

25:51.092 --> 25:53.674
being laid upon me

25:53.845 --> 25:57.178
in a manner quite lacking

25:57.348 --> 25:59.885
in my husband's touch.

26:00.059 --> 26:02.471
I should not speak
of such things.

26:02.645 --> 26:04.601
l dishonor myself.

26:04.772 --> 26:09.232
Your desires
should not shame you.

26:09.402 --> 26:11.768
You are a woman.

26:11.946 --> 26:15.109
Our needs are vast.

26:17.702 --> 26:20.114
- I must put my mind from it.
- To the purpose of distraction?

26:20.288 --> 26:22.654
Preferred to discovery.

26:22.832 --> 26:24.697
Such a thing
would ruin my husband

26:24.876 --> 26:27.458
and taint my father's name.

26:27.628 --> 26:29.664
Such concerns are voiced
by all those

26:29.839 --> 26:33.047
who sample our wares.

26:33.217 --> 26:36.209
Can you name any,
save Licinia?

26:39.056 --> 26:41.388
l have heard of none.

26:41.559 --> 26:43.424
No.

26:43.603 --> 26:45.514
You have not.

26:48.357 --> 26:50.848
Shall I make
the arrangements?

26:59.827 --> 27:01.658
Yes.

27:04.040 --> 27:05.951
You will not be disappointed.

27:08.085 --> 27:10.667
May | suggest Varro?

27:10.838 --> 27:12.419
Varro?

27:12.590 --> 27:14.296
No, far too common.

27:14.467 --> 27:17.300
The man must equal the risk--

27:17.470 --> 27:19.381
a fact well known

27:19.555 --> 27:21.637
by your own desires,

27:21.808 --> 27:25.721
ones that l admittedly share.

27:26.854 --> 27:28.594
( screams )

27:28.773 --> 27:30.013
Domina.

27:30.191 --> 27:33.354
Get out, you filthy slave!

27:33.528 --> 27:35.860
My ears suggest a tempest,

27:36.030 --> 27:38.271
but my eyes reveal
a wife gone fucking mad.

27:38.449 --> 27:41.282
Yes, well, look to ||ithyia
as the cause.

27:43.996 --> 27:46.578
What new slights have prompted
this costly eruption?

27:46.749 --> 27:48.956
Her cunt overflows

27:49.126 --> 27:52.789
at the thought of Licinia
bedding a gladiator.

27:52.964 --> 27:55.330
She demands
equal treatment,

27:55.508 --> 27:59.092
so she set her lust
on Crixus.

27:59.262 --> 28:02.299
And her choice
drives you into a rage?

28:06.310 --> 28:08.096
It's not her choice,

28:08.271 --> 28:10.307
it is her manner
that offends.

28:11.357 --> 28:13.473
Honey drips
from her tongue

28:13.651 --> 28:18.315
to conceal the bite of piss
that she showers upon us.

28:20.491 --> 28:23.358
The acrid taste
is well familiar,

28:23.536 --> 28:26.448
but we must learn to swallow it
along with our pride

28:26.622 --> 28:29.364
until we have secured
her husband's patronage.

28:29.542 --> 28:32.409
What need have we
of Glaber?

28:32.587 --> 28:35.454
Licinia delivers us
Marcus Crassus.

28:35.631 --> 28:37.371
Crassus's wealth
is undeniable,

28:37.550 --> 28:39.131
yet he but holds
the rank of senator.

28:39.302 --> 28:41.384
Glaber outweighs
with that of legatus.

28:41.554 --> 28:43.840
The favor
of both coin and title

28:44.015 --> 28:46.677
would speed
our ambitions.

28:46.851 --> 28:48.762
To rise,

28:48.936 --> 28:51.678
you would have me kneel.

28:51.856 --> 28:53.767
One day soon

28:53.941 --> 28:55.806
we will give ||ithyia
a lesson in manners.

28:55.985 --> 29:00.399
But for now necessity dictates
we give her Crixus.

29:00.573 --> 29:02.859
Make the arrangements.

29:19.175 --> 29:21.211
Fucking Gaul.

29:21.385 --> 29:24.798
Turn your thoughts.
I'll have at him soon enough.

29:28.684 --> 29:31.061
Spartacus:
You wish your brother dead?

29:31.228 --> 29:34.140
Who speaks such a thing?

29:34.315 --> 29:35.521
Your actions.

29:35.691 --> 29:37.898
| only wish to protect him.

29:38.069 --> 29:40.731
And who will do so
in the arena,

29:40.905 --> 29:43.442
where every man
must stand alone?

29:43.616 --> 29:45.356
You do him no favors.

29:45.534 --> 29:46.910
You lie!

29:47.078 --> 29:50.195
Varro! Varro! Hey.

29:50.373 --> 29:52.159
Tell him you lie.

29:52.333 --> 29:53.698
I did what you
paid me to do.

29:53.876 --> 29:56.162
I sought out his wife,
but she was not there.

29:56.337 --> 29:58.669
- The boy?
- I found no one.

29:58.839 --> 30:01.421
But there were traces
of blood on the floor and--

30:03.302 --> 30:05.133
Spartacus:
Varro, regain your senses.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.044
Calm yourself.

30:12.019 --> 30:14.510
Men:
Varro, kill him, kill him!

30:14.689 --> 30:16.179
- Kill him.
- Come on.

30:20.820 --> 30:23.061
Guards.

30:29.078 --> 30:32.241
( panting )

30:48.014 --> 30:51.757
They will not break.
I have tried.

30:51.934 --> 30:53.174
Speak to Batiatus.

30:53.352 --> 30:55.843
- Towards what purpose?
- You have his ear.

30:56.022 --> 30:58.104
If he would let me leave these walls
for but a day or two...

30:58.274 --> 31:00.481
- He would not allow it.
- You will not even make attempt?

31:00.651 --> 31:02.562
You are fortunate
only to be chained.

31:02.737 --> 31:04.648
To petition Dominus
with such insanity

31:04.822 --> 31:06.983
would only provoke
further punishment.

31:07.158 --> 31:09.023
How would that
help your cause?

31:12.121 --> 31:15.284
Ashur found only blood,
no bodies,

31:15.458 --> 31:17.574
which means your wife and child
may yet be living.

31:17.752 --> 31:20.619
The gods punish me
for failing them.

31:20.796 --> 31:24.334
The gods rarely take note
of fools.

31:24.508 --> 31:28.592
Now pull head from ass
and use it for once.

31:29.638 --> 31:31.970
Where would your wife and boy flee
if set upon?

31:32.141 --> 31:33.472
Think.

31:42.359 --> 31:44.850
Naevia.

31:51.035 --> 31:53.367
The hour is late.

31:53.537 --> 31:55.073
You should be in your cell.

31:55.247 --> 31:57.738
I could not sleep.

31:57.917 --> 32:01.705
My mind is full of thoughts
of the arena.

32:04.381 --> 32:06.758
Embrace the sands of time.

32:06.926 --> 32:09.417
As they flow,
| harbor no doubt

32:09.595 --> 32:10.880
you will again be
a champion.

32:11.055 --> 32:14.092
Capua already has
its champion.

32:14.266 --> 32:17.508
Spartacus bears the title,

32:17.686 --> 32:21.599
but I look towards a man of honor
to regain it.

32:32.493 --> 32:33.858
( gasps )

32:34.036 --> 32:36.243
If you value your life,

32:36.413 --> 32:39.496
never awaken a gladiator.

32:39.667 --> 32:41.532
Please.

32:41.710 --> 32:43.325
Domina sent me.

32:43.504 --> 32:46.166
Return the way you came.

32:53.472 --> 32:55.633
Why do you refuse me?

32:59.770 --> 33:01.852
Am I not pleasing?

33:02.022 --> 33:05.560
l have no desire
to lie with a woman

33:05.734 --> 33:08.862
who has been commanded
to do so.

33:09.029 --> 33:12.487
And what do you think will happen
if I fail such a command?

33:16.287 --> 33:17.902
Stay then.

33:22.168 --> 33:23.829
On the floor.

33:35.014 --> 33:38.802
Is there nothing I can do
for the champion of Capua?

33:43.480 --> 33:46.472
There is one desire

33:46.650 --> 33:49.562
I would have serviced,

33:49.737 --> 33:51.728
if you are able.

34:17.348 --> 34:19.179
Spartacus breathes fire
this morning.

34:19.350 --> 34:21.887
I wonder the cause.

34:22.061 --> 34:24.052
Mira,

34:24.230 --> 34:26.892
how did your evening pass
with our champion?

34:28.484 --> 34:31.647
He made many demands of me.

34:31.820 --> 34:34.027
Many demands, eh?

34:36.659 --> 34:39.025
Our Thracian
is ready to stud.

34:40.287 --> 34:42.278
I shall make arrangements
for this very night.

34:42.456 --> 34:46.699
When the sun rises,
we will have road to Marcus Crassus.

34:46.877 --> 34:50.040
What of ||ithyia
and her desire for Crixus?

34:52.633 --> 34:54.840
I've already set plans
in motion.

35:01.850 --> 35:03.636
( roars )

35:05.020 --> 35:07.136
( laughs)

35:07.314 --> 35:09.179
The pup bares his teeth.

35:24.206 --> 35:25.787
Sleep did not come?

35:27.584 --> 35:29.085
Nor is it deserved.

35:30.879 --> 35:34.918
Embrace dreams
when the sun falls.

35:35.092 --> 35:36.878
- l have news.
- Aurelia?

35:37.052 --> 35:39.509
Not yet.

35:39.680 --> 35:41.762
But I have dispatched Mira,
one of the house slaves,

35:41.932 --> 35:44.639
to look for her and your son.

35:47.855 --> 35:49.846
How did you manage
such a thing?

35:51.191 --> 35:53.648
She was sent by Domina

35:53.819 --> 35:56.356
to prepare me
for certain...

35:56.530 --> 35:58.191
duties required
of a champion.

35:58.365 --> 36:01.607
( laughs)

36:01.785 --> 36:04.367
So the gods
throw women at you now.

36:06.832 --> 36:10.199
Agh! Agh! Fuck.

36:28.228 --> 36:30.685
Your form returns.

36:30.856 --> 36:32.847
Pair with Hamilcar.

36:44.745 --> 36:47.657
It appears
Duro has lost his brother.

36:49.750 --> 36:51.411
Better that than his head.

36:53.337 --> 36:54.622
It's done?

36:54.797 --> 36:56.913
The whore Desponia
fucks no more.

36:58.175 --> 37:02.839
Nor the man inside her
when l slit her throat.

37:03.013 --> 37:04.674
It was not Solonius.

37:08.185 --> 37:09.391
Whew.

37:09.561 --> 37:11.176
Whose face do I look upon?

37:11.355 --> 37:13.061
Kasto r,

37:13.232 --> 37:16.565
one of Solonius's men.

37:17.861 --> 37:19.397
Send it to Solonius.

37:19.571 --> 37:22.608
Let him savor the relief
of escaping death

37:22.783 --> 37:25.149
for the moment.

37:42.928 --> 37:45.419
You will be bedding
a proper Roman woman,

37:45.597 --> 37:47.428
one far above
your station.

37:47.599 --> 37:50.090
Heed my words
that you not offend her.

37:50.269 --> 37:51.475
Yes, Domina.

37:51.645 --> 37:53.886
Speak not a word,
nor make a sound,

37:54.064 --> 37:56.396
save one of pleasure.

37:56.567 --> 37:58.523
Follow her lead.

37:58.694 --> 38:01.731
Anticipate her desires
and then fulfill them vigorously.

38:01.905 --> 38:03.361
Yes, Domina.

38:03.532 --> 38:05.693
In the arena
you are champion of Capua,

38:05.868 --> 38:09.326
but tonight
you are a common slave,

38:09.496 --> 38:11.828
to do as commanded.

38:11.999 --> 38:13.990
Are we clear?

38:16.044 --> 38:17.454
We are clear, Domina.

38:18.922 --> 38:21.129
They will prepare you
for the festivities.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.961
Wait until summoned.

38:30.601 --> 38:32.557
Fetch the best wine.

38:32.728 --> 38:35.344
I want our guest well plied
when she arrives.

38:35.522 --> 38:37.683
Domina.

38:47.701 --> 38:50.192
Where were you last night?

38:50.370 --> 38:52.782
I waited almost to the point
of detection.

38:52.956 --> 38:55.493
I could not break away.
I was tending to Domina.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.373
Domina

38:57.544 --> 38:59.455
or maybe that guard
I saw you with today?

38:59.630 --> 39:00.836
You are mistaken.

39:01.006 --> 39:02.871
lam not blind.

39:04.635 --> 39:07.968
You were touching his arm
and laughing.

39:08.138 --> 39:09.878
And the way
he gazed at you...

39:10.057 --> 39:12.924
If you are not blind,
then you would surely see

39:13.101 --> 39:15.092
that Hector gazes at all women
in the same fashion.

39:15.270 --> 39:18.228
I give no shit
about other women.

39:19.274 --> 39:21.356
You shame me.

39:23.153 --> 39:25.394
You shame yourself

39:25.572 --> 39:27.437
with thoughts
of imaginary slights.

39:27.616 --> 39:29.447
I know what I saw.

39:29.618 --> 39:31.825
No, you do not.

39:35.499 --> 39:37.785
Nor did Hector.

39:42.047 --> 39:43.958
His key.

39:44.132 --> 39:46.794
The purpose
of my smile and touch--

39:46.969 --> 39:49.005
the only one he received.

39:58.188 --> 40:00.144
l have but a moment
before I must return

40:00.315 --> 40:02.271
with Domina's wine.

40:02.442 --> 40:05.809
Use it to apologize
for ever thinking...

40:09.366 --> 40:11.573
You are my heart.

40:11.743 --> 40:14.860
I will never doubt
the beating of it again.

42:55.407 --> 42:57.614
(moaning)

43:26.688 --> 43:28.189
(woman moans loudly )

43:30.650 --> 43:33.141
Oh, apologies, Licinia.

43:33.320 --> 43:36.528
We appear to have arrived before
||ithyia's finished with Spartacus.

43:46.792 --> 43:48.157
No!

43:48.335 --> 43:49.541
(screaming )

43:49.711 --> 43:51.247
Guards.

44:05.352 --> 44:07.593
Oh,

44:07.771 --> 44:10.513
would this not set every tongue
in Rome wagging?

44:10.690 --> 44:12.897
(Licinia laughing)

44:13.068 --> 44:16.060
The wife of
Legatus Claudius Glaber

44:16.238 --> 44:17.694
fucking Spartacus,

44:17.864 --> 44:20.105
the man that nearly
ruined him.

44:20.283 --> 44:22.365
It is a scandal,
is it not?

44:22.536 --> 44:24.902
The most splendid
l have ever heard.

44:25.080 --> 44:27.162
(laughing)

44:27.332 --> 44:29.323
Stop laughing.

44:31.378 --> 44:34.165
Stop laughing.

44:37.217 --> 44:39.048
Stop laughing!

44:43.932 --> 44:45.843
||ithyia.

45:06.580 --> 45:08.491
What were you thinking?

45:08.665 --> 45:10.326
She slights me
at every turn.

45:10.500 --> 45:11.785
I wished only
to teach her a lesson.

45:11.960 --> 45:13.746
By pairing her
with Spartacus?

45:13.920 --> 45:15.751
If my husband
will not defend my honor,

45:15.922 --> 45:17.958
- I am forced to do it myself.
- Honor?

45:18.133 --> 45:19.919
Is that why the cousin
of Marcus Crassus

45:20.093 --> 45:21.503
lays dead
in ourfucking house?

45:21.678 --> 45:24.044
It was not my intent.

45:24.222 --> 45:26.634
Your intent
matters for nothing.

45:26.808 --> 45:28.799
Oh fuck!

45:31.938 --> 45:33.474
We are undone.

45:33.648 --> 45:36.811
No. Licinia came alone.

45:36.985 --> 45:39.351
She told no one
of her purpose.

45:39.529 --> 45:42.566
- No one?
- Not even her slaves.

45:43.575 --> 45:45.987
There is nothing to connect her
with the House of Batiatus

45:46.161 --> 45:48.026
once the body
is disposed of.

45:49.664 --> 45:51.040
What of ||ithyia?

45:51.207 --> 45:53.698
Oh, I'll take care of her.

46:07.057 --> 46:09.594
Apologies.

46:09.768 --> 46:12.726
It was an unfortunate mistake,
coupling you with Glaber's wife.

46:12.896 --> 46:16.104
Know that it was not my intent,
nor of my knowledge.

46:16.274 --> 46:19.391
It is I that owes apology.

46:19.569 --> 46:22.151
For a moment my hands
were not my own,

46:22.322 --> 46:25.405
but those of a man
who no longer exists.

46:28.578 --> 46:30.785
Let us not speak
of this night again.

46:31.831 --> 46:33.822
Spartacus,

46:34.000 --> 46:37.913
your loyalty--

46:38.088 --> 46:40.921
it honors this ludus.

46:45.845 --> 46:48.302
I did not mean...

46:51.267 --> 46:53.758
No.

46:53.937 --> 46:55.598
Of course you didn't.

46:55.772 --> 46:57.979
The way she laughed at me...

46:58.149 --> 47:01.141
You said I was to lie
with Crixus.

47:02.195 --> 47:04.732
Why did you give me
Spartacus?

47:04.906 --> 47:08.774
Why would you do
such a thing?

47:08.952 --> 47:12.444
You ask what you already
know answer to.

47:18.003 --> 47:19.288
Shh.

47:19.462 --> 47:22.249
My husband will see me
dead for this.

47:22.424 --> 47:24.460
You have killed me.

47:24.634 --> 47:26.625
No.

47:26.803 --> 47:29.795
l have brought us closer.

47:31.391 --> 47:33.848
No one will ever know
what happened here tonight.

47:34.019 --> 47:37.511
Licinia's body
will never be found.

47:37.689 --> 47:39.099
You're protected.

47:39.274 --> 47:40.764
No.

47:40.942 --> 47:42.807
They will know.

47:42.986 --> 47:44.817
They will see the deed
in my eyes.

47:44.988 --> 47:48.856
Then you'll stay here
with me

47:49.034 --> 47:51.241
until your eyes are clear.

47:51.411 --> 47:55.154
We've had our differences,
however veiled,

47:55.331 --> 47:59.415
but I've come to see
what a valuable friend you are.

48:11.014 --> 48:13.505
This will be our little secret.

48:31.076 --> 48:31.110
(theme music playing )

48:31.117 --> 48:33.403
(theme music playing )
