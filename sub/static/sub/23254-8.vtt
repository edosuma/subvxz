Are you OK?
Can I say something?

01:43.880 --> 01:44.960
Can we wait?

01:47.480 --> 01:50.240
Just for a bit, like, I don't know,
for a few days, is that OK?

01:50.320 --> 01:51.560
Yeah, of course.

01:54.600 --> 01:57.760
<i> I think it is OK.</i>
<i>We've got, like, our whole lives.</i>

01:58.960 --> 02:01.080
<i>Plus, I might feel like it tomorrow.</i>

03:13.240 --> 03:14.080
What? Nothing.

03:20.040 --> 03:21.800
I can't believe I've got a brother.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.440
I've probably got, like,
loads of them.

03:25.520 --> 03:27.720
All over the place.
I know he's traveled.

03:28.680 --> 03:31.080
I've probably got family in Vietnam
or some shit.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.400
I think I hate my dad
more than I hate my mum.

03:36.880 --> 03:37.920
Me, too.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.360
I hate both of mine,
but definitely hate my dad more.

03:41.440 --> 03:42.400
Why?

03:42.840 --> 03:44.640
'Cause she died and he didn't.

03:47.120 --> 03:48.520
She killed herself.

03:53.560 --> 03:54.640
I was there.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.600
I didn't do anything.

04:24.360 --> 04:25.760
What was she like?

04:28.280 --> 04:29.480
Really kind.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.440
Really sad.

04:35.640 --> 04:36.720
She just always...

04:38.200 --> 04:40.400
found everything a bit much, I think.

04:46.840 --> 04:48.400
It wasn't your fault.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.280
<i> It's like we're at the edge</i>
<i>of the world.</i>

05:01.880 --> 05:03.400
<i>Like we're safe.</i>

05:04.680 --> 05:07.000
<i>Only... we're not.</i>

05:07.800 --> 05:09.000
We can't stay here.

05:10.520 --> 05:12.560
-Nope.
-We can't go home.

05:13.240 --> 05:14.160
No.

05:17.280 --> 05:20.760
We should go away.
Properly away. Like, somewhere foreign.

05:21.320 --> 05:22.160
Yeah.

05:22.240 --> 05:25.480
Somewhere else
completely new and start again.

05:26.000 --> 05:26.880
Yeah.

05:28.080 --> 05:29.440
Do you want to do that, too?

05:29.520 --> 05:30.520
Yes.

05:33.360 --> 05:34.800
<i> I really did want that.</i>

05:38.320 --> 05:39.840
We could take your dad's boat.  We just need the keys.

06:30.640 --> 06:34.640
If you're doing what I think
you're doing, then you're a fucking idiot.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.360
Wherever you are,
call me when you get this.

07:04.560 --> 07:06.840
<i> It's much easier</i>
<i>to think someone's the answer</i>

07:06.920 --> 07:08.680
<i>if you haven't seen them for years.</i>

07:09.080 --> 07:10.680
<i>Because they're not really real.</i>

07:12.000 --> 07:15.160
<i>People can't be answers.</i>
<i>They're just more questions.</i>

07:17.040 --> 07:18.360
<i>Questions like:</i>

07:18.440 --> 07:21.080
<i>"Why are you</i>
<i>such a fucking useless dad?"</i>

07:27.200 --> 07:28.440
Ah, fuck!

07:31.640 --> 07:33.440
Ah, Alyssa! Ah!

07:34.000 --> 07:35.760
You came back! Oh, thank God.

07:36.360 --> 07:37.560
I was worried about you.

07:38.720 --> 07:41.760
-I was. I went looking for you everywhere.
-No, you didn't.

07:41.840 --> 07:44.800
You ran over a dog, killed it,
then fucked off and left me.

07:44.880 --> 07:46.480
Yeah, but after that. After all that.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.040
Wait, I killed the dog?

07:50.680 --> 07:51.600
Fucking hell!

07:55.080 --> 07:56.120
I'm sorry.

07:56.720 --> 07:59.080
I'm sorry, I was shit-faced.

08:00.640 --> 08:03.800
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm laughing
because it's bad, you know? I'm--

08:03.880 --> 08:05.280
Can we go out on the boat?

08:08.720 --> 08:09.600
What?

08:09.680 --> 08:11.960
Your boat.
Me and James want to go out on it.

08:13.080 --> 08:14.960
-Yeah. Now.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.160
OK. Fine.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.640
Give me, like, ten minutes.

08:24.880 --> 08:27.320
-I need a shit and a Berocca.
-You don't have to come with us.

08:28.480 --> 08:29.320
What do you mean?

08:29.840 --> 08:32.120
Just mean, it's cool, we'll manage.
James is a good driver.

08:32.200 --> 08:33.720
We'll have it back by lunchtime.

08:33.799 --> 08:36.600
Listen, girlie, I may not have seen you
for a few years...

08:37.240 --> 08:40.080
but I wasn't born yesterday. OK?

08:41.880 --> 08:43.200
So, what's the plan, then?

08:44.560 --> 08:46.040
Sail across the Channel?

08:46.880 --> 08:48.680
Get jobs at Disneyland Paris?

08:48.760 --> 08:50.000
Change your names?

08:52.160 --> 08:53.120
Who did you kill?

08:55.560 --> 08:56.520
What?

08:56.760 --> 08:58.160
Your faces are on the telly.

08:59.040 --> 09:00.520
There's a reward out.

09:01.400 --> 09:02.640
<i> Fuck.</i>

09:03.160 --> 09:04.200
Who did you kill?

09:06.960 --> 09:09.280
I'm not fucking Judge Judy.

09:09.360 --> 09:11.600
I'm interested, is all.

09:18.680 --> 09:21.840
Come on,
what did you do

09:23.520 --> 09:25.120
What did you do, kiddo?

09:25.720 --> 09:28.880
You are not taking
my fucking boat, OK?

09:29.080 --> 09:31.280
You don't want
to be drawing attention to yourselves.

09:31.360 --> 09:32.360
Take my word for it.

09:35.400 --> 09:39.040
OK. Everybody, just sit down,
and calm down.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.960
You're safe here, OK?

09:43.400 --> 09:44.400
I promise.

09:44.480 --> 09:46.320
Oh, you "promise," do you?

09:46.400 --> 09:48.640
-Well, that means a lot.
-Shut your fucking mouth!

09:48.720 --> 09:50.240
Don't speak to her like that.

09:51.400 --> 09:52.320
Or what?

09:54.280 --> 09:55.280
Hmm

10:02.880 --> 10:03.720
OK.

10:05.160 --> 10:06.200
OK, I'm sorry.

10:09.680 --> 10:10.520
I'm sorry.  Look...

10:12.400 --> 10:13.960
I'll make us a cup of tea.

10:15.080 --> 10:16.920
Yeah

10:17.720 --> 10:18.760
Yeah, OK.

10:19.360 --> 10:20.360
James, tea?

10:20.440 --> 10:21.560
No, thanks.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.120
I'm gonna make you tea.

10:34.640 --> 10:35.880
Want the good news
or bad news?

10:38.520 --> 10:40.440
The bad news is:

10:40.520 --> 10:41.760
we've no milk.

10:45.400 --> 10:46.920
But the good news is...

10:47.840 --> 10:48.920
we've got biscuits.

10:50.440 --> 10:51.560
James

10:56.320 --> 10:57.600
Yeah, go on, then.

11:03.240 --> 11:05.400
Seriously, girl, are you OK?

11:08.160 --> 11:09.080
What happened?

11:09.600 --> 11:10.680
You can tell me.

11:12.040 --> 11:13.320
Why would I trust you?

11:14.280 --> 11:15.480
Come on, darling.

11:16.080 --> 11:19.240
Look, granted... I'm not the greatest.

11:19.920 --> 11:22.680
But I'm still your daddy.
Of course you can trust me.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.880
Why didn't you tell me
about your little boy?

11:27.560 --> 11:28.560
Because...

11:31.760 --> 11:35.280
Ah, shit.
Because I was embarrassed, OK?

11:36.480 --> 11:37.720
Because I felt ashamed.

11:40.040 --> 11:41.160
He's called Milton.

11:42.440 --> 11:43.360
He's eight.

11:45.240 --> 11:47.600
He's weirdly good at spelling.

11:48.680 --> 11:50.400
I'm sorry, I should have said.

11:52.120 --> 11:54.200
Can we start again

12:00.360 --> 12:02.160
-There was a man.
-Alyssa...

12:03.080 --> 12:04.040
OK...

12:06.120 --> 12:07.120
We killed him.

12:09.200 --> 12:10.040
OK.

12:11.120 --> 12:12.720
Don't worry, it's OK.

12:16.040 --> 12:17.880
He was going to hurt me.

12:19.200 --> 12:20.400
Oh, darling.

12:21.160 --> 12:22.400
He was bad.

12:25.240 --> 12:26.760
He was really bad.

12:28.800 --> 12:30.240
<i> I don't know why I knew.</i>

12:30.800 --> 12:32.040
<i>I just did.</i>

12:32.120 --> 12:33.760
<i>Something didn't feel right.</i>

12:34.640 --> 12:35.920
Hey, it's OK.

12:36.760 --> 12:37.600
It's OK.

12:38.520 --> 12:39.680
Darling...

12:40.920 --> 12:42.440
Darling?
I killed him.

12:43.360 --> 12:46.120
I killed him.
She didn't do anything.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.240
<i> Stay where you are.</i>

12:47.320 --> 12:49.040
-He called 999.

12:49.120 --> 12:52.160
Baby? Baby, listen to me.
I'm trying to protect you.

12:52.760 --> 12:54.560
You fucker!
Argh!

12:55.120 --> 12:56.880
Police!

12:59.200 --> 13:02.000
<i> We've found the suspects.</i>
<i>The boy's confessed to the murder.</i>

13:02.080 --> 13:02.960
Where are they?

13:03.040 --> 13:06.160
<i>We've traced the call to the coast road.</i>
<i>Armed unit on its way now.</i>

13:10.920 --> 13:13.000
Argh!
You actually in the police?

13:13.080 --> 13:14.160
Yes!

13:16.560 --> 13:18.680
Can you stop pointing
that at me, please?

13:24.240 --> 13:26.280
I wouldn't do that.
What

13:26.360 --> 13:28.240
The knife's stemming the blood. Leave it.

13:28.880 --> 13:30.440
Have you got any antiseptic?

13:30.520 --> 13:32.480
I've got some Arnica
in the bathroom.

13:32.560 --> 13:34.760
Let's not piss into the wind.
Just leave it.

13:34.840 --> 13:36.680
You'll be fine.
An armed unit's on its way.

13:36.760 --> 13:39.440
OK, look. We haven't got long.
What is going on?

13:39.520 --> 13:41.000
I want to help you, all right? Listen.

13:41.080 --> 13:42.720
We need to go.
No.

13:43.440 --> 13:45.560
Can't let you do that.
You can't keep running.

13:45.640 --> 13:46.640
You can't.

13:47.080 --> 13:49.560
It's better that you hand yourselves
in now, willingly, to me,

13:49.640 --> 13:51.560
and I can help you
sort out a manslaughter plea.

13:51.640 --> 13:54.480
-No, you have to stop.

13:55.120 --> 13:56.600
Especially you, James.

13:57.280 --> 13:59.480
-You're 18 now.

13:59.560 --> 14:01.920
-Happy birthday, by the way.

14:03.640 --> 14:04.920
You're eighteenth?

14:05.800 --> 14:07.280
Why didn't you say anything?

14:08.400 --> 14:09.800
I would've got you a present.

14:09.880 --> 14:11.600
I saw your dad yesterday.

14:12.720 --> 14:14.040
He told me about your mum.

14:14.880 --> 14:17.400
He showed me the picture of you all.
The one in his wallet.

14:18.200 --> 14:19.520
He doesn't have one in his wallet.

14:22.960 --> 14:24.000
Is he angry with me?

14:24.520 --> 14:25.440
No, he's worried.

14:26.360 --> 14:27.440
Your mum's worried, too.

14:27.680 --> 14:28.520
Yeah, right.

14:28.600 --> 14:29.600
She is.

14:30.520 --> 14:31.960
Your stepdad's a nasty twat isn't he?

14:33.280 --> 14:34.160
Yeah.

14:36.560 --> 14:38.320
What'll happen to us
if we do what you say?

14:38.400 --> 14:39.640
Nothing too bad.

14:39.720 --> 14:42.040
If you let me help you.
Yeah, right.

14:42.120 --> 14:44.200
-Don't lie to them.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.160
They'll lock you up
and throw away the key.

14:46.240 --> 14:47.880
Mr. Foley, that's actually not the case.

14:47.960 --> 14:48.800
They will.

14:48.880 --> 14:51.240
-Don't listen to her.
-You called the police, Leslie!

14:51.320 --> 14:53.520
Whoa! I'm trying to protect you.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.640
-From him.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.800
It wasn't for the reward?

14:58.440 --> 14:59.320
How much?

14:59.400 --> 15:02.000
Look, you didn't kill anybody, did you?

15:02.560 --> 15:03.800
-He's right.

15:04.480 --> 15:07.320
-I'll go with you. I'll hand myself in.
No way!

15:07.400 --> 15:09.880
Listen, sweetheart,
take it from someone who knows.

15:09.960 --> 15:11.920
-You take after your mum.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.320
You have shit taste in men.

15:13.880 --> 15:15.920
Take the opportunity
to get rid of this one.

15:17.320 --> 15:19.000
Argh! What is wrong with you?

15:19.520 --> 15:21.680
You want to know what's wrong
with me, yeah?

15:21.800 --> 15:22.640
You.

15:23.640 --> 15:25.800
You are. You don't care about me.

15:25.880 --> 15:29.480
-You don't give the tiniest shit--
-Course I care. Of course I give a shit--

15:29.560 --> 15:32.000
You shouldn't just make people
if you're going to abandon them

15:32.080 --> 15:34.920
because they think they've done
something wrong their whole lives.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.960
Don't give me that victim shit, Alyssa.

15:37.040 --> 15:40.680
We can all do that.
"I'm anorexic because I was adopted."

15:40.760 --> 15:43.360
"I cheat on women
because I wasn't breastfed."

15:43.800 --> 15:46.000
Everyone has a reason
for how they behave.

15:46.080 --> 15:47.800
What's yours then?
Huh?

15:47.880 --> 15:50.480
Why are you such a prick?
<i> I love him so much.</i>

15:50.560 --> 15:52.560
You know what? He's right.

15:53.360 --> 15:54.800
But I didn't come looking for you.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.160
Right? I kept away.

15:56.240 --> 15:58.680
I thought it would be best
if you forgot all about me.

15:58.760 --> 16:00.800
-We haven't really got time--
-Just give me a second.

16:03.040 --> 16:04.880
Why did you send me the cards, then?

16:04.960 --> 16:06.440
For my birthday.

16:10.120 --> 16:11.760
Did you even send them?

16:14.080 --> 16:15.120
Oh, my God, was it my mum?

16:16.720 --> 16:19.640
She shouldn't have done it.
It's really irresponsible.

16:19.720 --> 16:21.000
I feel like I'm going mad.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.800
Hey! To be mad in a deranged--

16:22.880 --> 16:25.680
Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
Stop quoting yourself!

16:34.120 --> 16:37.480
Will we go to prison if we hand
ourselves in Will we?

16:37.560 --> 16:38.760
Look, yes, possibly.

16:38.840 --> 16:41.640
-No, but the thing--

16:41.720 --> 16:43.280
-No.

16:43.360 --> 16:44.880
-I'm sorry.

16:46.720 --> 16:47.840
Jesus Christ!

16:47.920 --> 16:49.240
Give me the keys to your boat.

16:50.360 --> 16:51.360
She's breathing.

16:52.160 --> 16:53.800
Come on, James, we have to go now!

17:04.280 --> 17:06.160
Shit!

17:14.599 --> 17:15.599
Fuck!

17:24.720 --> 17:25.600
Argh!

17:35.440 --> 17:38.000
Armed police! Armed police!
Stay down!

17:41.160 --> 17:43.080
Eunice, can you hear me

17:43.520 --> 17:45.000
They're on the beach!

17:46.680 --> 17:48.000
Move out! Move out!

17:48.080 --> 17:49.440
Say that I kidnapped you.

17:49.880 --> 17:51.120
-Yeah.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.920
Tell them that I did it all.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.040
Then you'll be OK.
Nothing will happen to you.

17:55.120 --> 17:56.960
No. No way.
We're going together. Come on!

17:59.600 --> 18:00.920
-I'm sorry.

18:02.040 --> 18:04.880
Armed police, stay where you are!

18:04.960 --> 18:06.080
Put down the weapon!

18:06.600 --> 18:08.400
What the fuck are you doing?

18:09.040 --> 18:09.880
James!

18:11.040 --> 18:13.160
No!

18:14.440 --> 18:16.200
No! Get off me!

18:18.640 --> 18:20.120

18:22.120 --> 18:23.440
