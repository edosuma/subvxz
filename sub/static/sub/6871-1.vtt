Ow. <i>Khao lard gaeng.</i>

00:32.165 --> 00:33.832
<i>Sawat dee?</i>

00:33.834 --> 00:35.467
Well, since I can only assume

00:35.469 --> 00:37.069
<i>this is one of your idiot</i>
<i>voicemails, I...</i>

00:37.071 --> 00:38.570
Mother?!

00:38.572 --> 00:40.172
Well, I'm not falling
for it again.

00:40.174 --> 00:42.307
<i>Oh, for...</i>
<i>Mother, it's me, Sterling.</i>

00:42.309 --> 00:44.676
Then, what is
the square root of nine?

00:44.678 --> 00:45.844
<i>Uh...</i>

00:45.846 --> 00:47.179
<i>Negative nine?</i>

00:47.181 --> 00:48.847
Sterling?

00:48.849 --> 00:51.417
<i>Ha! Elaborate...</i>
<i>God damn it!</i>

00:51.419 --> 00:54.686
I'm kidding, it's three,
and also me. <i>Ass.</i>

00:54.688 --> 00:56.021
Now, how'd the hell you find me?

00:56.023 --> 00:57.689
I didn't, the CIA did.

00:57.691 --> 00:59.758
Oh, and how are
your new overlords?

00:59.760 --> 01:01.760
<i>Oh for the... They're not...</i>

01:01.762 --> 01:04.096
<i>Look, think of it</i>
<i>as more of a merger.</i>

01:04.098 --> 01:05.497
Ha!

01:05.498 --> 01:08.600
Organizations change.
They evolve. They grow.

01:08.602 --> 01:09.868
<i>Unlike some people I know.</i>

01:09.870 --> 01:11.070
Hey, you know what?

01:11.072 --> 01:12.538
To wit, once again you're off

01:12.540 --> 01:15.541
on one of your usual
self-pitying benders.

01:15.543 --> 01:17.209
It's not a usual one, mother.

01:17.211 --> 01:18.911
In case you forget,
I was forced into

01:18.913 --> 01:20.913
becoming a parent
against my will.

01:20.915 --> 01:22.848
<i>Join the club.</i>

01:22.850 --> 01:25.050
<i>But for god's sake,</i>
<i>six weeks is long enough.</i>

01:26.120 --> 01:27.953
Really? It's been six weeks?

01:27.955 --> 01:30.522
Yes, so sober up and get a bunch
of penicillin shots, because...

01:30.524 --> 01:32.357
Is that him?
<i>Is that Lana?</i>

01:32.359 --> 01:33.759
Let me talk to him.
<i>Let me talk to her.</i>

01:33.761 --> 01:36.028
So, why'd you run away
when you were so excited

01:36.030 --> 01:37.563
about being a father
when A.J. was born?

01:37.565 --> 01:38.964
Did reality set it?

01:38.966 --> 01:41.366
<i>I... Wait,</i>
<i>was that rhetorical?</i>

01:41.368 --> 01:42.734
Because the next time you use

01:42.736 --> 01:44.636
somebody's sperm
to impregnate yourself,

01:44.638 --> 01:46.038
then maybe that decision

01:46.040 --> 01:47.873
should include
that other somebody.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.477
Who? That other somebody
who runs away

01:51.479 --> 01:52.878
at the thought of responsibility

01:52.880 --> 01:54.613
and as we speak is up
to his eyeballs

01:54.615 --> 01:57.049
in cobra whisky
and ladyboy hookers?

01:57.051 --> 01:59.818
Oh, that is...

01:59.820 --> 02:00.819
You don't know me.

02:00.821 --> 02:02.087
<i>Ha!</i>

02:05.493 --> 02:07.559
I believe there was some mention

02:07.561 --> 02:09.761
of the Central
Intelligence Agency?

02:09.763 --> 02:11.964
They've given us
our first freelance mission,

02:11.966 --> 02:13.465
and if you screw it up,

02:13.467 --> 02:15.901
There won't be a second one,
so listen up.

02:15.903 --> 02:17.936
I'm listening.

02:17.938 --> 02:20.072
<i>Two days ago,</i>
<i>an American spy plane</i>

02:20.074 --> 02:21.406
<i>went down</i>
<i>in the jungles of Borneo</i>

02:21.408 --> 02:24.176
<i>about 500 miles from you.</i>

02:24.178 --> 02:27.179
The pilot ejected, but without
the on board computer.

02:27.181 --> 02:30.182
You're to secure it,
then destroy the aircraft.

02:30.184 --> 02:32.584
<i>You should be receiving</i>
<i>a mission dossier...</i>

02:32.586 --> 02:34.486
<i>Well, now.</i>

02:34.488 --> 02:38.457
Wow. <i>Read it on the way to
the airport, and hurry.</i>

02:38.459 --> 02:39.858
<i>All the equipment you'll need</i>

02:39.860 --> 02:41.660
<i>is on an air America cargo plane</i>

02:41.662 --> 02:43.462
<i>That is waiting</i>
<i>for you as we speak.</i>

02:43.464 --> 02:46.098
Uh, mother, it sounded
like you said, "cargo plane,"

02:46.100 --> 02:47.499
when obviously you meant,

02:47.501 --> 02:50.335
"first class luxury
commercial airliner."

02:50.337 --> 02:53.138
Sterling, a commercial airline

02:53.140 --> 02:54.873
won't let you parachute
into the jungle

02:54.875 --> 02:57.776
in the middle of a communist
insurgency... <i>A what?</i>

02:57.778 --> 03:01.280
...at night.
Now, don't screw this up!

03:02.348 --> 03:03.549
"Screw it up."

03:03.551 --> 03:05.150
Yeah, like she's one to talk.

03:05.152 --> 03:06.351
Look how I turned out.

03:06.353 --> 03:08.220
Hey, freaky bigtime!

03:08.222 --> 03:10.055
You owe us
a hundred thousand bhat!

03:10.057 --> 03:12.024
Oh, right, yeah, no problem.

03:12.026 --> 03:14.626
Oh, and I've got
an extra twenty thousand

03:14.628 --> 03:16.628
if you're genetic females.

03:20.900 --> 03:23.235
Super.

04:03.776 --> 04:07.079
God, okay, final offer,
ten thousand baht,

04:07.081 --> 04:08.714
some of which has blood on it.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.616
For the millionth and last time,

04:10.618 --> 04:13.051
we do not
have mini-bottles!

04:13.053 --> 04:15.120
Well, then this
isn't a real airline.

04:15.122 --> 04:18.390
No, it's not.
It's a CIA front!

04:18.392 --> 04:19.791
Still, though.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.892
Why don't you go read
the damn dossier?

04:21.894 --> 04:24.129
Read about
the communist insurgency.

04:24.131 --> 04:25.931
I don't do dossiers.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.799
Besides, I'm not
a CIA schoolgirl.

04:27.801 --> 04:30.202
This is a cakewalk
for a real spy.

04:30.204 --> 04:32.204
I punch the coordinates
in the gps,

04:32.206 --> 04:34.706
get the computer,
blow up the plane with C4,

04:34.708 --> 04:35.974
and, uh...

04:35.976 --> 04:38.143
So then do you guys
pick me up, or...?

04:38.145 --> 04:39.411
Read the dossier.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.412
No.

04:40.414 --> 04:42.247
Suit yourself.

04:42.249 --> 04:43.382
Go, go, go, go, go!

04:43.384 --> 04:44.449
Wha...

04:45.785 --> 04:47.886
Assho...

04:47.888 --> 04:48.954
Woohoo!

04:48.956 --> 04:52.257
Halo!

04:52.259 --> 04:53.592
But mini-bottles?

04:53.594 --> 04:55.127
That's not a bad...

04:55.129 --> 04:56.928
I'm sorry, Hank.

04:56.930 --> 04:59.264
I forget you were
working the program.

04:59.266 --> 05:00.766
Inappropes.

05:00.768 --> 05:03.235
Oh, my god,
oh, my god, oh my god!

05:03.237 --> 05:05.504
Are you guys
so frickin' excited?

05:05.506 --> 05:08.273
I would be,
if you quit jumping around.

05:08.275 --> 05:10.609
Seriously, honey,
come on. Baby on board.

05:10.611 --> 05:12.577
And if you two dopes
didn't screw up

05:12.579 --> 05:14.646
this $10 million renovation...

05:14.648 --> 05:16.748
Which, again, curious as to why

05:16.750 --> 05:18.116
you put Pam and Cheryl
in charge.

05:18.118 --> 05:20.352
Because I had
a very specific vision,

05:20.354 --> 05:22.988
and it wasn't
"Japanese whorehouse."

05:24.325 --> 05:25.691
Well, Ms. Archer,
I think you'll find

05:25.693 --> 05:29.027
we were very true
to your vision.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.595
Oh, I've dreamed of this day.

05:30.597 --> 05:31.630
I know.

05:31.632 --> 05:33.632
It's... I mean...

05:33.634 --> 05:34.700
I don't know what to say.

05:34.702 --> 05:36.468
Can I even wear shoes in here?

05:36.470 --> 05:39.037
Oh, this is nothing.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.605
Wait till you see...

05:40.607 --> 05:42.140
Oh, my god!

05:42.142 --> 05:45.477
I... I think I could
use a drink.

05:47.815 --> 05:49.481
Oh, shut up.
Hey.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.116
Wha...

05:51.118 --> 05:52.984
Psych!

05:54.388 --> 05:55.954
No, bring it back.

05:55.956 --> 05:58.657
It's exactly like it was!

05:58.659 --> 06:01.693
We redid everything
exactly like it was before.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.962
Jesus, god, I'm having a stroke.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.964
No, the other one
was just a hologram.

06:05.966 --> 06:08.333
What the...?

06:08.335 --> 06:09.534
What, what?
What just happened?

06:09.536 --> 06:11.737
Oh, man!

06:11.739 --> 06:13.672
The look on your dumb face.

06:13.674 --> 06:14.840
No, it's a stroke.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.308
I smell toast.

06:16.310 --> 06:18.410
Oh, that's probably just Milton.

06:18.412 --> 06:20.278
Okay, it's the one new thing.

06:21.247 --> 06:22.514
It makes...

06:22.516 --> 06:24.015
Lemme finish!

06:24.017 --> 06:25.350
...toast.

06:25.352 --> 06:28.420
You ruined it.

06:32.258 --> 06:33.592
Agh, son of a...

06:33.594 --> 06:36.395
God, is one last
non-malarial hurrah

06:36.397 --> 06:38.363
before I go home
too much to ask?

06:38.365 --> 06:40.399
Agh, thanks jungle.

06:40.401 --> 06:42.434
Eat a buffet of dicks.

06:42.436 --> 06:44.903
Okay, the plane should be
just about a half click

06:44.905 --> 06:46.171
down this trail, and...

07:03.589 --> 07:04.856
Stop!

07:04.858 --> 07:07.392
Stop! Jesus, Kato,
will you stop?

07:07.394 --> 07:08.894
I mean, is this
a mugging, or...?

07:08.896 --> 07:10.095
You are American.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.863
Hey, English, good.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.632
Yes, I'm American.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.133
Then we are at war!

07:15.135 --> 07:18.069
We... We as in who,
exactly?

07:18.071 --> 07:20.605
America,
and the empire of Japan.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.607
The... Wait a minute,
do you mean, like,

07:22.609 --> 07:25.210
cool Honda scrambler Japan,
or...

07:25.212 --> 07:27.879
super uncool Pearl Harbor Japan?

07:27.881 --> 07:29.080
What?

07:29.082 --> 07:30.382
How long have you
been on this island?

07:30.384 --> 07:32.417
Since the tenth of May...

07:32.419 --> 07:33.919
1942.

07:33.921 --> 07:35.220
Oh, boy.

07:35.222 --> 07:37.389
Uh, well, Kato...

07:37.391 --> 07:38.557
Sato!

07:38.559 --> 07:41.126
First lieutenant Sato Kentaro.

07:41.128 --> 07:44.329
Well Ken,
I've got some bad news.

07:45.465 --> 07:48.133
Oh, and also some worse news.

07:52.405 --> 07:56.007
Liar. Why would I lie
about the war being over?

07:56.009 --> 07:58.643
Since 1945, I might add.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.412
To trick me into surrendering

08:00.414 --> 08:02.481
Um...
I do not surrender,

08:02.483 --> 08:05.183
nor consent to be your prisoner,

08:05.185 --> 08:06.485
so just kill me.

08:06.487 --> 08:07.652
What? No.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.688
Ken, will you relax

08:09.690 --> 08:11.323
or is your entire generation

08:11.325 --> 08:13.325
physically incapable
of doing that?

08:13.327 --> 08:15.827
How can I relax
while we are at war?

08:15.829 --> 08:18.663
We're not!
Here, shut up, look.

08:18.665 --> 08:21.333
Here's you guys signing the
surrender on the USS Missouri.

08:21.335 --> 08:23.301
Here's all the V-J Day
parades in America.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.837
Here's <i>the bad news bears</i>
<i>go to Japan.</i>

08:25.839 --> 08:28.173
That's Lupus and Tanner.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.274
Oh, and here's a link
to an episode

08:29.276 --> 08:30.842
of <i>the six million man</i>

08:30.844 --> 08:33.178
about this exact thing
we're doing right now.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.846
The six million who?

08:34.847 --> 08:37.482
Oh, god, you've got
so much to catch up on.

08:37.484 --> 08:39.049
Okay, so there's this guy,
Steve Austin,

08:39.052 --> 08:40.519
and he was an astronaut,

08:40.520 --> 08:42.854
but... Damn, wait. Okay.
So, an astronaut...

08:42.856 --> 08:45.857
What is this thing?
This device?

08:45.859 --> 08:48.994
It's a telephone, kinda,
that talks to outer space,

08:48.996 --> 08:50.795
And also... Shit!

08:50.797 --> 08:53.331
What? I'm supposed to
go find a computer.

08:53.333 --> 08:54.633
Here?

08:54.635 --> 08:56.368
There are no building
in the jungle

08:56.370 --> 08:58.570
big enough to hold a computer!

08:58.572 --> 09:00.005
No, they're really small, now.

09:00.007 --> 09:02.140
I think you guys
actually did that.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.875
Anyway, I need to go
get one out of a plane

09:03.877 --> 09:05.410
that crashed near here, so...

09:05.412 --> 09:07.846
Yes, I know where
this airplane is.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.381
Duh. Me, too.

09:09.383 --> 09:12.217
So, if I just kinda leave,
are you gonna be cool,

09:12.219 --> 09:15.086
or try to sneak up on me
and slit my throat?

09:16.389 --> 09:18.590
Well, I hope you're happy...

09:18.592 --> 09:20.859
because I feel like
a total dick.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.761
And also kinda racist.

09:22.763 --> 09:25.297
And I resent you making me
feel like that, so...

09:28.035 --> 09:29.935
I'm not a racist.

09:29.937 --> 09:34.105
I just wanted it
to be all white.

09:34.107 --> 09:36.274
Jeezy Petes, this drawer squeaks

09:36.276 --> 09:38.343
exactly like the old one did!

09:38.345 --> 09:39.611
And is this...

09:39.613 --> 09:41.079
Is this Brett's blood?

09:41.081 --> 09:43.882
Ugh, no, just the same type.

09:43.884 --> 09:45.850
We had to fudge it
a little on the stains,

09:45.852 --> 09:47.586
some of which
actually were fudge.

09:47.588 --> 09:49.688
And some of which
merely resembled it.

09:51.358 --> 09:53.959
But why would you do this?

09:56.096 --> 09:58.063
Okay, it should be
right up here,

09:58.065 --> 09:59.798
and if you try
any funny stuff...

09:59.800 --> 10:01.866
Please, be more quiet.

10:01.868 --> 10:04.569
Many enemy soldiers
patrol the jungle.

10:04.571 --> 10:07.973
Guerillas, I think,
Chinese and Malays.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.375
Oh, that must be the insurgency
they were talking about,

10:10.377 --> 10:11.743
the communists.

10:11.745 --> 10:14.479
They are communists?
So, America's allies?

10:14.481 --> 10:17.782
What? No.
Communists hate America.

10:17.784 --> 10:20.585
No, American
and Russian and Chinese

10:20.587 --> 10:22.420
are fighting together
for communism.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.255
No, against fascism!
And that was...

10:26.325 --> 10:28.293
Ow!

10:28.295 --> 10:29.828
Ouch.

10:29.830 --> 10:32.130
Ya think?!
Ya think ouch, do ya?

10:33.800 --> 10:34.966
The guerillas!

10:34.968 --> 10:36.735
They will kill me, let me go!

10:36.737 --> 10:40.105
They'll kill me!
Pull me up, or I will kill you!

10:42.409 --> 10:44.843
At least give me the gun.

10:44.845 --> 10:46.311
I'll give you the bullets!

10:46.313 --> 10:48.680
You would rather we both die?!

10:48.682 --> 10:51.983
I'm honestly
kind of on the fence!

10:54.621 --> 10:55.620
Oh, shut up.

10:55.622 --> 10:57.288
Hey.

10:57.290 --> 11:01.459
And here's your office,
Ms. Archer...

11:05.098 --> 11:07.198
And if the rest of you
will follow me,

11:07.200 --> 11:09.934
we've still got a lot to cover.

11:09.936 --> 11:12.137
But it's all just
the same as it was.

11:12.139 --> 11:13.805
Exactly.
That's the whole point.

11:13.807 --> 11:15.106
But it almost would've
been cheaper

11:15.108 --> 11:16.875
to build a time machine
and go back

11:16.877 --> 11:18.810
to before the office
got blown up.

11:18.812 --> 11:21.012
We looked into that!

11:21.014 --> 11:22.981
But that technology
doesn't exist!

11:22.983 --> 11:24.382
I'll catch up, I gotta
run in here real quick

11:24.384 --> 11:26.284
and grab some urinal cakes.

11:26.286 --> 11:29.020
Why the hell do you
need urinal cakes?

11:29.022 --> 11:30.355
For my shower at home.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.890
Oh, lord.
Gross.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.802
Ms. Archer looks like a mule
kicked her in the face.

11:44.837 --> 11:46.071
How's the water?

11:46.073 --> 11:49.307
Sweet baby James, it is perfect.

11:49.309 --> 11:50.875
Um... Uh...

11:50.877 --> 11:52.210
Pam.
Pam.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.646
Yes, of course,
I know you're...

11:55.748 --> 11:57.749
So I gained the weight back.
Sue me.

11:57.751 --> 11:58.883
No, I was...

11:58.885 --> 12:00.318
Look, my therapist says

12:00.320 --> 12:02.320
everybody's got a hole
that needs to be filled.

12:02.322 --> 12:03.855
Some people fill it with drugs,

12:03.857 --> 12:05.223
some fill it with work,

12:05.225 --> 12:06.925
some fill it with
between-meal snacks

12:06.927 --> 12:08.827
and liquor
and their therapist's cock.

12:08.829 --> 12:12.564
Um, I was actually
looking at your pubic hair.

12:12.566 --> 12:14.566
Oh, yeah.
It's a lightning bolt,

12:14.568 --> 12:16.735
but I guess the letters
could use a touch-up.

12:16.737 --> 12:18.670
It's supposed to say "TCB."

12:18.672 --> 12:21.039
"Takin' Care of Beaveness."

12:21.041 --> 12:22.240
Super.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.708
Kampai.

12:23.710 --> 12:24.843
Kampai.

12:26.612 --> 12:28.279
Is that medicine?

12:28.281 --> 12:30.582
Painkillers.
Mixed with candy.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.083
I call 'em "Mike and Vikes."

12:32.085 --> 12:33.551
Hm.

12:33.553 --> 12:35.386
I'm sorry about your foot.

12:35.388 --> 12:36.855
Why? It's not your...

12:36.857 --> 12:39.390
Wait, you led me right into
that damn tiger trap?!

12:39.392 --> 12:42.193
My orders were to defend
this island from the enemy

12:42.195 --> 12:43.628
until I was relieved.

12:43.630 --> 12:46.197
I'm not...
America's not your enemy!

12:46.199 --> 12:48.399
Japan has no enemies!
You're like...

12:48.401 --> 12:50.635
I wanna say a platypus,

12:50.637 --> 12:53.638
but I'm not sure
if that's an accurate analogy.

12:53.640 --> 12:56.141
You were saying something
before you fell in,

12:56.143 --> 12:57.609
about the communists?

12:57.611 --> 12:59.277
Huh? Oh, yeah.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.279
Like, literally the
day after the war ended,

13:01.281 --> 13:03.581
the U.S. and Russia
became mortal enemies.

13:03.583 --> 13:06.885
China, too.
Called the Cold War.

13:06.887 --> 13:09.053
Then we kinda
became friends again.

13:09.055 --> 13:11.222
So, now you are...

13:11.224 --> 13:12.757
Now...

13:12.759 --> 13:14.592
I'm actually not sure
where we stand.

13:14.594 --> 13:17.295
We left it kinda weird.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.965
Who is we?
I do not understand.

13:20.967 --> 13:23.067
So, I work with,
and used to date,

13:23.069 --> 13:26.571
a woman named Lana,
who got pregnant.

13:26.573 --> 13:29.741
Well yes, but you can hardly
blame Sterling for being upset,

13:29.743 --> 13:30.775
I mean...

13:30.777 --> 13:33.311
Ugh, even the ice is the same!

13:33.313 --> 13:34.846
That hint of bleach.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.681
Anyway, you didn't
ask if you could use his...

13:36.683 --> 13:38.483
...goop.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.351
What?!
Malory, the whole thing about

13:40.353 --> 13:43.454
me using his "goop"
was your idea!

13:43.456 --> 13:45.623
Prove it.

13:45.625 --> 13:48.159
So now let's talk about
this name, Abbiejean.

13:48.161 --> 13:51.429
Don't you think she'd be
better off if she were a...

13:51.431 --> 13:52.363
Malory?

13:52.365 --> 13:53.665
Thoughts?

13:53.667 --> 13:56.301
You do not want
to know my thoughts.

13:56.303 --> 14:01.039
I do, Ken.
I much very do.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.607
You're a major dickhole.

14:03.977 --> 14:06.678
And you're kind of a mean drunk.

14:06.680 --> 14:09.447
My wife, Hatsumi,
and my daughter, Keiko.

14:09.449 --> 14:12.951
Do you know what I would
give to have seen her grow up?

14:12.953 --> 14:15.320
Yeah, but... And now
you have the chance

14:15.322 --> 14:19.324
I never had,
but you just throw it away.

14:19.326 --> 14:22.360
I mean, ya know,
I'm going back, obviously,

14:22.362 --> 14:24.529
I'm gonna parent the shit
outta that kid,

14:24.531 --> 14:26.831
I just...
I just needed some...

14:26.833 --> 14:30.034
time or space or whatever,

14:30.036 --> 14:32.036
you know, to kinda...

14:34.741 --> 14:36.107
Dickhole.

14:41.146 --> 14:43.548
<i>The March of News!</i>

14:43.550 --> 14:46.150
The tide of war in the Pacific
is finally changing,

14:46.152 --> 14:48.219
<i>as U.S. Marines</i>
<i>attack the Japs</i>

14:48.221 --> 14:50.922
<i>On the island of Guadalcanal.</i>

14:54.693 --> 14:56.527
I dunno. Some cereal.

14:56.529 --> 14:57.528
It's supposed...

14:57.530 --> 14:59.330
supposed to be good for you.

14:59.332 --> 15:00.665
What's that...
What, what...

15:00.667 --> 15:02.433
What's that?! What the...?

15:02.435 --> 15:04.335
Oh. Morning, Ken.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.004
So I know this a long shot,

15:06.006 --> 15:09.540
but do you know how
to make eggs Woodhouse?

15:09.542 --> 15:10.842
Ken?

15:10.844 --> 15:12.110
Ken, what are you doing...

15:12.112 --> 15:13.411
<i>Victory in the Pacific!</i>

15:13.413 --> 15:15.413
<i>Japan finally surrenders,</i>

15:15.415 --> 15:17.415
<i>brought to her knees</i>
<i>by the explosion</i>

15:17.417 --> 15:18.416
<i>of two atomic bombs...</i>

15:18.418 --> 15:19.717
What? No, no, no!

15:19.719 --> 15:20.952
No, Ken. Turn it off.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.954
<i>The first, dropped on Hiroshima,</i>

15:22.956 --> 15:24.923
<i>and the second, on Nagasaki.</i>

15:28.595 --> 15:29.894
I, uh, I...

15:29.896 --> 15:30.895
I'm sorry.

15:30.897 --> 15:31.930
Why?

15:31.932 --> 15:33.765
Why? Why are you sorry?!

15:33.767 --> 15:35.300
That you had to see that.

15:35.302 --> 15:36.567
That it even happened
in the f...

15:38.905 --> 15:41.439
Sneak attack.
Typical.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.540
Aiyah!

15:42.542 --> 15:44.042
Hello?

15:44.044 --> 15:45.710
<i>Goddammit.</i>

15:45.712 --> 15:47.211
Mother...
Mother, it's...

15:47.213 --> 15:48.713
Well, listen up,
vinny voice-mail.

15:48.715 --> 15:50.548
I hope you check your messages,

15:50.550 --> 15:52.617
because if you don't
retrieve that computer

15:52.619 --> 15:55.653
and meet the extraction
team within the next two hours,

15:55.655 --> 15:56.921
you can just...

15:56.923 --> 15:58.890
get used to bananas!

16:00.460 --> 16:01.592
<i>If you'd like to make a call...</i>

16:03.663 --> 16:06.464
Even the damn phone is the same.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.433
Everything is the same.

16:08.435 --> 16:09.467
Jesus!

16:11.604 --> 16:14.639
Okay, so, Ken,
we've got a situation.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.240
We don't have anything.

16:16.242 --> 16:19.310
You have a situation.
I am going home to Japan!

16:19.312 --> 16:21.145
Well unless
you wanna swim there...

16:21.147 --> 16:23.681
which, spoiler alert,
you can't, it's too far...

16:23.683 --> 16:24.949
you're gonna need my help!

16:24.951 --> 16:27.852
Ha! Because you
also need my help.

16:27.854 --> 16:29.620
Only because you just broke
two of my ribs,

16:29.622 --> 16:32.857
in addition to impaling me
on a bamboo stake,

16:32.859 --> 16:36.294
on which, I think we both know,
you smeared some poop!

16:36.296 --> 16:39.263
I... And if you did I
don't wanna know!

16:39.265 --> 16:40.431
Because...

16:40.433 --> 16:41.966
you'd have no idea what

16:41.968 --> 16:44.035
you're supposed
to be looking for!

16:44.037 --> 16:45.770
Not that I do,
necessarily, but...

16:45.772 --> 16:48.506
Will you please hurry?

16:48.508 --> 16:51.042
Keep your raggedy
bits of shirt on!

16:51.044 --> 16:53.378
That looks
pretty computery to me.

16:53.380 --> 16:55.113
So now all I have to do is...

16:56.516 --> 16:57.849
Shit.
Come.

16:57.851 --> 16:58.850
We must go now.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.785
Not yet.
I gotta blow this thing.

17:00.787 --> 17:03.354
Then blow it, and then come.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.556
I mean, really?

17:05.558 --> 17:07.458
It's like why even...

17:08.395 --> 17:09.493
I'm sorry!

17:09.496 --> 17:11.396
No, no, no, no, no!

17:21.373 --> 17:24.409
Hey, remember that time
you broke some of my ribs?!

17:24.411 --> 17:25.877
And then all the remaining ones?

17:25.878 --> 17:27.412
It's your own fault.

17:27.414 --> 17:30.314
My fault... Oh, shit,
I didn't blow it!

17:30.316 --> 17:33.418
What?! I was supposed
to blow up the plane!

17:33.420 --> 17:35.353
No, what're you...
I'll just lie!

17:35.355 --> 17:37.355
You cannot shirk your duty!

17:37.357 --> 17:41.692
Yes, I can! I do it all the time!
Goddammit.

17:41.694 --> 17:42.927
Asshole!

17:54.206 --> 17:56.674
Which way
to the extraction point?

17:56.676 --> 17:58.910
Uh...
I guess head for the beach?

18:02.781 --> 18:03.781
Well?

18:03.783 --> 18:05.183
Yeah, it's nice,

18:05.185 --> 18:06.884
although, I assumed
there'd be a bar.

18:06.886 --> 18:09.020
You said this
was the extraction point.

18:09.022 --> 18:11.622
Uh, no, I merely implied that.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.391
I have no idea where it is.

18:13.393 --> 18:15.560
Although...

18:15.562 --> 18:17.962
Ah, so you did know.

18:17.964 --> 18:20.264
No, I totally didn't.
Swear to god.

18:20.266 --> 18:23.034
Things just usually
work out for me.

18:23.036 --> 18:25.436
Which...
I kinda take for granted.

18:25.438 --> 18:26.604
You Archer?

18:26.606 --> 18:27.972
Duh!

18:27.974 --> 18:29.874
So, ready to go home?

18:29.876 --> 18:31.309
I think no.

18:31.311 --> 18:34.145
I have been gone far too long.

18:34.147 --> 18:37.315
My family, even if
they are still alive,

18:37.317 --> 18:40.251
surely by now
they have moved on.

18:40.253 --> 18:42.820
Uh-huh. It would not
be fair to them,

18:42.822 --> 18:45.723
if I were to return
after so many years.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.492
Yeah, return to, uh...

18:47.494 --> 18:50.661
Where did you and Hatsumi
and Keiko used to live?

18:50.663 --> 18:52.964
Hm? Oh, Takamori.

18:52.966 --> 18:55.133
A very small town,
in Nagano Prefecture, but...

18:59.939 --> 19:02.740
<i>Moshi moshi.</i>

19:02.742 --> 19:03.741
Hatsumi?

19:03.743 --> 19:06.744
Sato Hatsumi?
<i>Hai.</i>

19:06.746 --> 19:09.514
Hatsumi...

19:11.518 --> 19:13.651
<i>Kentaro-san?</i>

19:13.653 --> 19:15.353
Hatsumi.

19:26.765 --> 19:28.866
Hey, there's
this new thing we have

19:28.868 --> 19:30.234
called a schedule.

19:32.504 --> 19:34.839
We need a minute!

19:34.841 --> 19:36.174
Captain shit-nuts!

19:37.376 --> 19:38.776
Tell her I said hi.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.811
Nope.

19:40.813 --> 19:43.714
No, no, huh-uh, no.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.616
You don't disappear
for six weeks,

19:45.618 --> 19:47.618
and then just waltz
in here like you never left,

19:47.620 --> 19:49.053
and casually say, "hi"!

19:49.055 --> 19:51.556
First of all, Lana,
I didn't waltz in here,

19:51.558 --> 19:54.125
not with nine broken ribs,
a punctured lung,

19:54.127 --> 19:56.127
severe penetration trauma
to my foot,

19:56.129 --> 19:58.863
and poop-related septicemia!

19:58.865 --> 20:00.565
- And also crabs.
- Ugh!

20:00.567 --> 20:02.567
I assume from the jungle.

20:02.569 --> 20:03.801
Oh please, if...

20:03.803 --> 20:05.636
Not to mention
that stupid computer,

20:05.638 --> 20:07.038
which is why you're upset,

20:07.040 --> 20:09.207
I mean jealous,
because I aced the mission!

20:09.209 --> 20:10.241
What?

20:10.243 --> 20:12.009
And you did blow up the plane?

20:12.011 --> 20:14.145
The plane blew up!
Yes! I don't...

20:14.147 --> 20:15.313
Jealous?

20:15.315 --> 20:16.747
Oh, shut up.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.049
Hey!

20:18.051 --> 20:19.717
I'm not jealous
about the mission.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.886
I'm upset because no one
knew where you were.

20:21.888 --> 20:25.022
And if, huge if,
you're gonna be involved,

20:25.024 --> 20:27.925
oh my god, in any sort
of parental role for Abbiejean..

20:27.927 --> 20:31.095
No, yeah, and I, ya know,
I want to.

20:31.097 --> 20:33.531
But are we married
to Abbiejean, or...?

20:33.533 --> 20:35.066
Believe me, I tried.

20:35.068 --> 20:37.068
Zip it, gee-baw!

20:37.070 --> 20:39.537
No! I will not
be called gee-baw.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.606
It's grandmother Archer
or nothing!

20:41.608 --> 20:42.873
Then hush.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.242
Because we, you and I,

20:44.244 --> 20:46.277
are gonna have to
establish some ground rules.

20:46.279 --> 20:48.012
Lana, they're just
gonna get broken.

20:49.249 --> 20:50.781
I am now going
to feed our child.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.550
If you'd like to talk
while I do so,

20:52.552 --> 20:53.751
follow me.

20:53.753 --> 20:57.188
I would!
I would love to talk, Lana.

20:57.190 --> 20:58.589
Just don't wanna have to listen.

21:01.727 --> 21:03.427
And how about
this renovation, huh?

21:03.429 --> 21:04.862
I can't believe
they pulled it off.

21:04.864 --> 21:06.931
What?
You knew about this?!

21:06.933 --> 21:08.699
Yeah, I was on
the planning committee.

21:08.701 --> 21:11.636
I'm not a huge fan of change.

21:12.905 --> 21:15.573
Except for you, Milton!
