Everyone,
I want to thank you all

00:35.870 --> 00:38.520
for helping us decorate
for the fall dance.

00:38.622 --> 00:40.688

Ah, been doing this
a long time, Meg.

pump the heat up to 92

09:39.079 --> 09:40.704
Eh?

09:43.750 --> 09:45.141
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:45.160 --> 09:48.086
Are you okay to swim like that?

09:48.279 --> 09:50.071
(chuckles)
Am I okay to swim?

09:50.090 --> 09:51.590
(shouts)
I'm not.

09:51.758 --> 09:54.092
I can only flap about
like a motorized tub toy.

09:54.285 --> 09:56.094
Please help me. And hurry.

09:56.287 --> 09:59.080
I'm about to get hit by
the old retired guy doing laps.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.840
Quick! He can't hear me

10:00.934 --> 10:02.992
because there's an investment
commercial playing in his head.

10:03.011 --> 10:05.086
<i> COMMERCIAL ANNOUNCER:</i>
<i> What are your retirement goals?</i>

10:05.147 --> 10:07.088
<i> Swimming past</i>
<i> a tiny-armed fat guy</i>

10:07.149 --> 10:08.681
<i> flailing in a public pool?</i>

10:08.775 --> 10:11.334
<i> T. Rowe Price.</i>
<i> We've got you covered.</i>

10:11.394 --> 10:14.988
Look at that guy.
He did everything right.

10:17.826 --> 10:19.784
Hey, what you doing?

10:19.977 --> 10:23.455
I... just won a 30-pound bag
of wood chips on eBay.

10:23.624 --> 10:25.457
-What's up with you?
-(chuckles) Listen,

10:25.626 --> 10:28.034
I wanted to talk to you
about Bruce.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.276
Isn't he the best?

10:29.338 --> 10:31.129
Uh-huh. Yeah, he's great.

10:31.280 --> 10:34.949
But you haven't noticed
anything different about him?

10:34.968 --> 10:37.618
-Like what?
-Well, I-I don't know
how to talk about this,

10:37.679 --> 10:41.547
but here's a film my father made
me watch when I was your age.

10:41.642 --> 10:43.624
<i> NARRATOR:</i>
<i> Then during lunch,</i>

10:43.644 --> 10:45.718
<i> Ralph showed him</i>
<i> some pornographic pictures.</i>

10:45.812 --> 10:47.720
<i> Jimmy knew he shouldn't</i>
<i> be interested,</i>

10:47.856 --> 10:49.555
<i> but, well, he was curious.</i>

10:49.691 --> 10:51.816
<i> What Jimmy didn't know</i>
<i> was that Ralph was sick--</i>

10:52.009 --> 10:55.728
<i> a sickness that was not visible</i>
<i> like smallpox,</i>

10:55.881 --> 10:57.989
<i> but no less dangerous</i>
<i> and contagious--</i>

10:58.182 --> 11:00.233
<i> a sickness of the mind.</i>

11:00.327 --> 11:02.852
<i>You see, Ralph was a homosexual,</i>

11:02.871 --> 11:05.980
<i> a person who demands</i>
<i> an intimate relationship</i>

11:06.041 --> 11:07.815
<i>with members of their own sex...</i>

11:07.876 --> 11:09.668
Is that Earth?

11:09.861 --> 11:14.063
Oh, for Pete's sake,
I am 99% sure Bruce is gay.

11:14.124 --> 11:16.900
What? Mom, he works
part-time at Lush.

11:16.960 --> 11:21.087
It's him and, like, ten girls.
Trust me, guy's a total P-hound.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.422
Listen, I'm just trying to...

11:22.516 --> 11:24.240
Oh, I know what
you're trying to do.

11:24.259 --> 11:26.000
Pathetic little Meg
is happy for once,

11:26.061 --> 11:27.668
and you just can't take it.

11:27.688 --> 11:28.836
And I get it, okay?

11:28.855 --> 11:30.263
You're in a miserable marriage,

11:30.357 --> 11:32.749
so why would you want
anyone else to be happy?

11:32.767 --> 11:34.250
Meg, that's ridiculous.

11:34.310 --> 11:36.436
Your father and I
love each other very much.

11:36.530 --> 11:38.345
Lois, where's the first aid kit?

11:38.407 --> 11:41.515
I tried to put a Ellio's
in the oven and I burnt my head.

11:41.576 --> 11:44.035
-Top of the closet.
-Oh, that little case?

11:44.187 --> 11:47.096
I've been taking that to work
to look like a businessman.

11:47.157 --> 11:49.290
Hold the elevator.
Hold the elevator.

11:50.234 --> 11:51.617
Sorry.

11:51.753 --> 11:53.545
Can someone push
any button, please?

11:53.738 --> 11:56.548
I don't work here,
I'm just being silly.

12:01.279 --> 12:03.888
(whoops)
I am throwing rocks tonight.

12:04.081 --> 12:05.206
Mark it, Bruce.

12:05.267 --> 12:07.951
Dang, Meg, you are hot tonight.

12:08.011 --> 12:09.877
And you're not so bad yourself.

12:09.938 --> 12:11.229
(laughs nervously)

12:11.422 --> 12:13.189
(phone ringing, vibrating)

12:15.059 --> 12:16.976
Ugh. My mother is so annoying.

12:17.128 --> 12:19.738
She's got some kind of hair
across her ass about us.

12:19.931 --> 12:22.556
-Oh, no.
-I know.

12:22.659 --> 12:24.909
I told my folks about you
and they lit up

12:25.061 --> 12:27.078
-like a Christmas tree.
-Really?

12:27.271 --> 12:29.472
You bet your sugar cookies
they did.

12:29.491 --> 12:31.065
They's coming to town tomorrow.

12:31.084 --> 12:34.160
But there's something
I wanted to ask you before that.

12:34.312 --> 12:37.313
Babe, I told you, I really don't
want to sell Herbalife.

12:37.332 --> 12:38.815
We'll give that time,

12:38.833 --> 12:41.167
but this is something
a little more special.

12:41.261 --> 12:44.337
Meg Harvey Oswald Griffin,
will you...

12:44.431 --> 12:48.157
Hey, hi. So, I told you
about ten minutes ago

12:48.218 --> 12:50.084
something's wrong with 14.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.511
Yep, somebody's working
on it, sir.

12:51.605 --> 12:53.087
KID:
Dad, what's going on?

12:53.148 --> 12:54.939
KID 2:
This sucks. I want to go home.

12:55.132 --> 12:57.091
Please. My wife's out of town.

12:57.194 --> 13:00.336
I-I don't know what else to do.

13:00.396 --> 13:03.022
You have to help me.

13:03.116 --> 13:06.284
You have to help me right now.

13:06.435 --> 13:08.011
Should just be
another couple minutes.

13:08.029 --> 13:09.954
KID 2:
Dad, Tyson spilled
fruit punch on me.

13:10.106 --> 13:11.122
KID:
No, I didn't.

13:11.315 --> 13:13.291
KID 2:
Dad!

13:13.460 --> 13:15.418
(sighs)

13:24.087 --> 13:25.637
Meg, there you are.

13:25.830 --> 13:28.122
-Look, I wanted
to apologize and...
-No need, Mom.

13:28.225 --> 13:30.291
Let me show you
just how wrong you were.

13:30.393 --> 13:33.311
Bruce and I are engaged!

13:33.504 --> 13:35.313
-What?
-PETER: Engaged?

13:35.464 --> 13:37.798
No daughter of mine
is getting married at 18.

13:37.859 --> 13:40.568
I forbid it. Forbidden!

13:51.498 --> 13:53.480
Peter, I'm sorry,
I'm just not okay

13:53.542 --> 13:56.835
with our daughter marrying
someone who is clearly gay.

13:57.028 --> 13:58.561
You know,
you're starting to sound

13:58.621 --> 14:00.487
an awful lot
like your own mother.

14:00.507 --> 14:01.989
This isn't gonna be good
for either of them.

14:02.050 --> 14:03.766
Lois, let me ask you something.

14:03.793 --> 14:06.511
What's the best-case scenario
for someone like Meg?

14:06.704 --> 14:10.089
Dying alone in a lighthouse?
Maybe Bruce changed.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.075
And-and either way,
Meg's happy for once.

14:12.093 --> 14:13.476
I say we go with it.

14:14.971 --> 14:16.688
It's gonna be all right.

14:16.839 --> 14:17.930
No, it's not gonna be all right.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.173
It's never gonna
be all right again

14:19.234 --> 14:20.433
if they go through with this.

14:20.585 --> 14:22.176
Peter, we got to do...

14:22.195 --> 14:24.103
Get a hold of yourself, woman.
She's coming downstairs.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.589
Well, there's the bride-to-be.

14:26.649 --> 14:28.608
-Oh, hey, Mom.
-Listen, Meg,

14:28.760 --> 14:30.943
I was hoping we could
put all this behind us.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.762
I'd like that.

14:32.780 --> 14:35.615
That's better. And I'm sorry
for what I said about Bruce.

14:35.709 --> 14:39.285
If you love him, then your
father and I fully support it.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.528
Thanks, Mom.
Speaking of which,

14:41.548 --> 14:43.623
I'm finally gonna meet
Bruce's parents.

14:43.758 --> 14:45.775
Would you guys want to
come to dinner with us?

14:45.793 --> 14:48.294
-Oh, we'd love to come.
-Oh, thank you, Mom.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.889
Family hug. Bring it in.

14:51.057 --> 14:53.057
Seriously, you got
to bring it in.

14:54.919 --> 14:58.379
Oh, Meg, I haven't seen you
smile like this in a long time.

Yes, a heterosexual marriage,
just like you always wanted.

15:28.428 --> 15:31.154
And I did, too.
All of us did.

15:31.255 --> 15:33.005
Well, as someone
who doesn't get subtext,

15:33.099 --> 15:35.249
I just want to say cheers.

15:35.310 --> 15:37.584

This calls for champagne.

We would like
your finest champagne

15:44.778 --> 15:47.403
and your longest fork
and knife, please.

So, Phil,
what line of work you in?

Ooh, what did you order? Mind?

Uh... uh-huh. Y-Yes.
