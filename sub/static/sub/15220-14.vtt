There's the music in the stars.

18:36.372 --> 18:38.540
The way they sparkle.

18:38.540 --> 18:40.918
I feel them.

18:40.918 --> 18:43.295
There's music in the light

18:43.295 --> 18:47.466
as they dance on the water at night.

18:47.466 --> 18:52.805
And how the leaves
chase each other, laughing.

18:53.430 --> 18:55.724
Like children that play.

18:57.184 --> 18:59.603
When I feel the wind on my face,

18:59.603 --> 19:01.897
the wind is my music.

19:08.112 --> 19:10.656
So I came to New York to dance.

19:10.656 --> 19:13.701
Being a waitress
is just a way to survive

19:13.701 --> 19:19.373
until I get a break. If you can call
the tips I made tonight surviving.

19:20.874 --> 19:24.837
Diana, you know, there was
a choreographer at the club tonight.

19:24.837 --> 19:27.881
Joanne Chapman.
You know her?

19:27.881 --> 19:30.092
She's incredible.

19:30.092 --> 19:33.554
Well, she's having open auditions
on Monday.

19:33.554 --> 19:37.057
Well, I already danced for her.
She didn't even notice me.

19:37.057 --> 19:41.020
You mean tonight at the club?
That wasn't an audition.

19:41.020 --> 19:43.439
I mean, she was just having fun.

19:43.439 --> 19:46.608
Monday is the audition.
What if I'm not good enough?

19:48.235 --> 19:50.529
What if you are?

19:53.157 --> 19:55.117
Good night.
Good night.

20:01.457 --> 20:03.500
(WHISTLES A TUNE)

20:21.643 --> 20:24.605
Hey, honey,
you got any spare change?

20:24.605 --> 20:27.316
Honey, can you spare a dime?

20:27.316 --> 20:29.568
Hey! What are you?
Deaf or something?

20:29.568 --> 20:31.820
God! These kids!

21:07.648 --> 21:11.735
(SHOUTING) Rod told me you weren't
interesting at dancing at parties.

21:14.738 --> 21:18.867
Rod told me you weren't
interested in dancing at parties.

21:18.867 --> 21:21.286
He had no right to tell you that!

21:21.286 --> 21:24.289
Well, maybe not,
but I already booked the gig.

21:24.289 --> 21:28.544
Sorry. Look, are you short
a little bread? I can lend you some.

21:29.127 --> 21:32.297
I don't take handouts.
Oh.

21:32.297 --> 21:36.927
Well, we could always figure out
another way to pay me back.

21:38.136 --> 21:40.389
You understand what I am saying?

21:47.312 --> 21:49.648
He's a real sweetheart.

21:49.648 --> 21:53.193
I can't make enough on tips
to get through the winter.

21:54.319 --> 21:56.488
Maybe I can book you into something.

21:57.656 --> 22:00.033
Maybe I can book you into something.

22:00.033 --> 22:02.160
Really?
Yeah.

22:02.160 --> 22:04.913
Until then, you need
to borrow a couple of bucks?

22:06.164 --> 22:08.959
No, no, no.
Just give me a job dancing.

22:08.959 --> 22:11.211
All right. I'll do my best, kid.

22:11.211 --> 22:13.338
Come back tomorrow, huh?

22:32.899 --> 22:35.527
What...? What are you doing?

22:36.278 --> 22:38.405
Sign language. See?

22:38.405 --> 22:41.575
This...this means 'boring'.

22:42.326 --> 22:46.538
Oh, I thought you ran out of Kleenex
or something.

22:46.538 --> 22:48.623
That's 'boring'.

22:49.624 --> 22:51.877
What have you got
on a Joanna Chapman?

22:51.877 --> 22:55.047
Hm. Joanna Chapman.

22:55.047 --> 22:57.174
Oh, oh, Al.

22:58.008 --> 23:00.093
Look at this.

23:01.845 --> 23:04.014
What do you think that says?

23:04.014 --> 23:07.017
Oh, that's the incy wincy -
No, no, no.

23:07.017 --> 23:09.186
No, no, no. No!

23:12.355 --> 23:14.483
That's 'Quantum Leap'?
Yeah.

23:14.483 --> 23:16.610
Quantum Leap.

23:16.610 --> 23:18.653
That's neat.

23:18.653 --> 23:20.822
Quantum...

23:20.822 --> 23:24.493
Oh, Joanna Chapman - here we go.
She's a hotshot choreographer.

23:24.493 --> 23:26.495
She's one of the best
in the country.

23:26.495 --> 23:29.414
I know. I saw her dance last night.
I think I'm here

23:29.414 --> 23:33.001
to get Diana into her dance company.
She hasn't even graduated

23:33.001 --> 23:35.629
from high school.
She'll do it here while dancing.

23:35.629 --> 23:38.632
As what? A stripper -
No, I've taken care of it.

23:38.632 --> 23:40.759
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

23:40.759 --> 23:42.844
I took care of that.

23:43.970 --> 23:46.056
Oh, hi. Come on in.

23:46.765 --> 23:50.227
How dare you tell Mario
I wouldn't dance at his party!

23:50.227 --> 23:52.896
I just didn't want you to...

23:52.896 --> 23:55.232
I didn't want you to make a mistake.

23:55.232 --> 23:58.151
The only mistake
was letting you walk me home!

23:58.151 --> 24:00.737
Well, stay away from me,
Rod The Bod!

24:00.737 --> 24:02.823
Diana...

24:16.999 --> 24:19.543
I ain't got nobody like that here.

24:19.543 --> 24:21.879
Well, I dropped her off here
last night.

24:21.879 --> 24:24.048
Are you telling me I'm crazy?
No, no.

24:24.048 --> 24:28.260
She's pretty, she's got big eyes,
kind of blonde-ish hair.

24:29.845 --> 24:32.765
She's deaf.
Oh, the deaf girl?

24:32.765 --> 24:36.143
She don't live here.
She's been parking back and forth

24:36.143 --> 24:38.437
across the street
for the last month.

24:38.437 --> 24:41.482
The last month? Yeah.
See that blue and white van?

24:41.482 --> 24:45.402
I called the city council, asked
them to come in and clear her out.

24:45.402 --> 24:48.489
You think they did anything?
Hell, no! Not a thing!

24:48.489 --> 24:50.616
Thank you.
It's just trash.

24:50.616 --> 24:54.161
This whole neighbourhood
is getting to be trash. Total trash.

25:16.559 --> 25:19.854
I told you to stay away from me.
I didn't think you meant it.

25:19.854 --> 25:22.940
You're crazy!
I'm not living in a tow-away zone.

25:22.940 --> 25:26.151
Diana, listen to me.
I'm just trying to help you.

25:26.151 --> 25:28.612
So you tell Mario
I don't want to dance?

25:28.612 --> 25:31.365
Stripping is not the same as dancing.
You strip!

25:31.365 --> 25:33.534
There's a difference.
I don't see it.

25:33.534 --> 25:36.412
Neither do I, but -
You're here because I'm deaf.

25:38.914 --> 25:41.250
That's not what this is about.
Yes, it is!

25:41.250 --> 25:43.544
You think
I'm a poor little deaf girl,

25:43.544 --> 25:45.880
who needs hearing people
to protect me.

25:45.880 --> 25:48.090
Even if you had perfect hearing,

25:48.090 --> 25:52.052
I still wouldn't want to see you
dancing in one of Mario's parties.

25:52.052 --> 25:55.848
Why? Don't you think I can dance
as good as you?

25:55.848 --> 25:59.476
No. I think you can dance
better than me.

25:59.476 --> 26:03.188
Good enough to get
into Joanne Chapman's dance company.

26:03.188 --> 26:05.316
I can't dance for Joanne.
Why not?

26:05.316 --> 26:07.401
I just can't.
You could try.

26:09.695 --> 26:11.739
What are you saying?

26:12.573 --> 26:15.159
I...I...

26:15.159 --> 26:17.494
I don't understand you.
Good.

26:17.494 --> 26:19.955
Now you know
what the world feels like to me.

26:24.126 --> 26:27.546
Listen. This is not about being deaf.

26:27.546 --> 26:31.342
This is about being afraid.
I'm not afraid of anything.

26:31.342 --> 26:34.303
You're afraid of failing.
I can't dance her style.

26:34.303 --> 26:37.014
Yes, you can. I have seen you dance.
You're great.

26:37.014 --> 26:39.183
But it's not her style.

26:39.183 --> 26:43.395
If I want to dance in Joanne's
company, I have to copy her.

26:43.395 --> 26:46.982
You danced with her.
She's strong and sharp

26:46.982 --> 26:49.068
and she's a star.

26:49.068 --> 26:51.987
I don't dance like that.

26:51.987 --> 26:55.532
I-I need more experience
before I audition.

26:55.532 --> 26:57.701
How are you going to get it?

26:57.701 --> 27:00.120
By stripping at parties?
I'm not a stripper!

at a turning point in your life.

goes up or a road that goes down.

No, because you're good.

Yes, if you speak clearly and slowly
and to her.

Are you kidding? Your plates are
out of state. Your tags are expired.

35:08.149 --> 35:11.945
And you've got $120 worth of parking
tickets. My stuff's in there.

35:12.612 --> 35:15.657
Well, cough up $120 and it's yours.
What?

35:15.657 --> 35:17.867
You want to go to jail?

35:17.867 --> 35:19.911
Please, let me take my things out.

35:21.412 --> 35:23.873
Now, get it out of here, Charlie.
Let's go.

35:23.873 --> 35:25.917
All right. All right.

35:48.392 --> 35:51.604
Where have you been? I've been
looking everywhere for you.

35:51.604 --> 35:55.066
You found me a dance job?
Well, not exactly.

35:55.066 --> 35:59.904
Um...you see, a friend of mine,
who's visiting town,

35:59.904 --> 36:02.073
needs a date for tonight.

36:02.073 --> 36:05.368
Now, I promised him
that I'd show him a good time,

36:05.368 --> 36:07.453
but uh...I'm kinda stuck here.

36:11.165 --> 36:13.709
I-I don't need a date, I need a job.

36:15.044 --> 36:17.171
This is a job.

36:19.590 --> 36:22.843
Look, he just wants
to have a little fun.

36:24.220 --> 36:27.515
How much for this 'little fun'?

36:27.515 --> 36:29.684
I think he's good for at least 300.

36:29.684 --> 36:31.769
Maybe more, if he likes you.

36:32.520 --> 36:34.939
Come on, it's just this one time

36:34.939 --> 36:38.276
just to tide you over
till you get a dance gig, OK?

36:40.069 --> 36:42.530
Now, here's a little loan.

36:42.530 --> 36:46.325
You go and buy yourself a nice dress
and some new shoes.

36:46.325 --> 36:48.494
I don't want it.

36:48.494 --> 36:51.163
Well, you can't go on a date
dressed like that.

36:54.375 --> 36:56.460
Come on.

37:13.561 --> 37:16.314
(PHONE RINGS)
Oh.

37:19.191 --> 37:21.527
Hello. Mario's Hideaway.

37:21.527 --> 37:23.738
Yes. Yes, we do private parties.

37:23.738 --> 37:25.865
Hi, Rod.
Hey. Have you seen Diana?

37:25.865 --> 37:28.743
I'm sorry. Could
you just hold a minute, please?

37:28.743 --> 37:31.620
Um...no. Why?
Mario doesn't have her working

37:31.620 --> 37:33.998
at one of his parties, does he?
No.

37:33.998 --> 37:38.127
You and Mario made a deal. You're
more important to him than she is.

37:38.127 --> 37:40.963
If you see her, tell her
I'm looking for her. Sure.

37:43.049 --> 37:45.217
Otto?
Yo, Rod.

37:45.217 --> 37:49.013
Have you seen Diana?
The little cocktail waitress?

37:49.013 --> 37:52.767
Yeah, she was talking to Valerie
and then she split.

37:54.310 --> 37:56.645
Tonight?
Yeah, a minute ago.

37:56.645 --> 37:59.607
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Yes, I am.

37:59.607 --> 38:02.068
Am what?
Yes, I am wondering

38:02.068 --> 38:05.404
if you know what Valerie's
last name is. Yeah, Nevski.

38:05.404 --> 38:08.074
Why? Are you thinking
about hitting on her too?

38:11.160 --> 38:14.038
Good. Good. Goodbye.

38:14.038 --> 38:16.832
Where's Diana?
You just asked me that.

38:16.832 --> 38:19.085
And you lied to me.
No, I didn't.

38:19.085 --> 38:22.129
Yes, you did. No!
Well, you didn't tell me the truth.

38:22.129 --> 38:25.674
Basically, that's the same thing.
She was upset and needed a job.

38:25.674 --> 38:29.929
My guess is
you're probably the last person
she'd want to know about that.

38:29.929 --> 38:32.056
I was trying to help her.

38:32.056 --> 38:34.725
Yeah, right
into the horizontal tango.

38:34.725 --> 38:38.604
You gave her a job?
It was more like a date.

38:38.604 --> 38:43.150
Uh-oh. How about this? In '77,
Irma La Douce here was arrested

38:43.150 --> 38:45.194
for -
Prostitution.

38:45.194 --> 38:47.530
That's a sleazy word for dating.

38:47.530 --> 38:49.990
The kid was broke and scared.

38:49.990 --> 38:52.159
I was doing her a favour.

38:54.356 --> 38:57.526
I'm not going to judge
how you live your life, Valerie.

38:57.526 --> 39:00.112
But if Diana does this,
it will destroy hers.

39:00.112 --> 39:02.197
I'm not ashamed about what I do.

39:03.615 --> 39:05.868
Well, maybe not.

39:05.868 --> 39:09.454
But if you could go back to the
first time, would you do it again?

39:11.290 --> 39:13.417
Ziggy's got a fix on Diana.

39:13.417 --> 39:16.044
The Park Grove Hotel. Room 1203.

39:18.171 --> 39:20.215
How come I never get a nice guy?

39:24.720 --> 39:26.763
(BANGING ON DOOR)

39:28.515 --> 39:30.726
Yeah, yeah. Just leave the tray.

39:30.726 --> 39:33.103
What the hell do you want?
Diana.

39:33.103 --> 39:35.564
She's not here.
She's in the bathroom.

39:35.564 --> 39:37.733
Yes, she is.
You want me to call security?

39:37.733 --> 39:40.527
So they can put you under the jail?
Good idea.

39:40.527 --> 39:44.489
I'm sure they'd like to hear about
an unregistered minor in your room.

39:44.489 --> 39:46.617
19 is a legal adult
in New York City.

39:46.617 --> 39:48.869
Breaking and entering is a felony.

39:48.869 --> 39:52.414
Unless you want me to call security,
dance yourself out of here.

39:52.414 --> 39:54.583
Call 'em.

39:58.962 --> 40:01.131
Yes, give me security.

40:04.343 --> 40:06.470
Don't do this.

40:07.220 --> 40:11.683
What I do is NONE of your business!

40:11.683 --> 40:15.145
You made me go to an audition.
I fail.

40:15.145 --> 40:17.272
And you can't fix my life.

40:17.272 --> 40:19.566
You're right, OK?

40:19.566 --> 40:22.319
But I'm going to be gone soon -
maybe tonight

40:22.319 --> 40:24.821
or tomorrow or the next day.

40:24.821 --> 40:27.949
I'm going to be out of your life,
but you're not.

40:27.949 --> 40:30.744
One time, OK?
Yeah, until the next time

40:30.744 --> 40:33.288
when you need food
or a place to sleep again.

40:33.288 --> 40:36.458
You sell yourself every night.
I sell an illusion.

40:36.458 --> 40:38.710
It's not me.

40:42.130 --> 40:44.758
This is all I have left.

40:44.758 --> 40:47.386
No, no. That's not true.

40:48.220 --> 40:52.432
You've...you've got your talent.
This is the only talent they want

40:52.432 --> 40:54.601
from a deaf girl.

40:54.601 --> 40:56.978
That's a lie.

40:59.022 --> 41:01.316
That's a lie, and you know it.

41:01.316 --> 41:03.735
This man
is harassing the young lady.

41:03.735 --> 41:06.279
When I asked him to leave,
he refused.

41:06.279 --> 41:08.281
You lying dog!

41:08.281 --> 41:10.909
Is that true?
Come on, Diana. Just say no.

41:10.909 --> 41:13.578
Miss?

41:15.789 --> 41:17.916
Miss?

41:17.916 --> 41:20.001
No. No, he's not.

41:21.753 --> 41:24.673
He's my friend
and I was just leaving.

41:24.673 --> 41:26.716
Attagirl!

41:36.852 --> 41:39.187
Everything's gonna be OK. You'll see.

41:46.903 --> 41:48.947
(MUSIC PLAYS)

41:56.037 --> 41:58.290
Very nice. I like it. I like it.

42:05.463 --> 42:07.507
Keep going.

42:09.384 --> 42:12.053
Very nice. Rod The Bod.
Sorry to bother you.

42:12.053 --> 42:15.682
I sure didn't expect to see you
after what happened yesterday.

42:15.682 --> 42:18.977
I'm so sorry. Listen.
Everybody deserves a second chance.

42:18.977 --> 42:21.104
Absolutely.
Including Diana.

42:21.104 --> 42:25.025
Look, even if she was
the best dancer there,

42:25.025 --> 42:28.278
I still couldn't have taken her.
Because she's deaf?

42:28.278 --> 42:31.740
I'm a running a professional
dance company, not a social service.

42:31.740 --> 42:34.868
You saw her dance.
You couldn't follow my instructions.

42:34.868 --> 42:38.496
Because she couldn't see your lips.
If you'd be more aware

42:38.496 --> 42:41.666
when you were talking to her,
there'd be no problem.

42:41.666 --> 42:45.462
The hardest thing in the world is to
get a dance company off the ground.

42:45.462 --> 42:47.589
Being black didn't make it
any easier.

42:47.589 --> 42:50.008
All these people are my best.

42:50.008 --> 42:53.595
Look...somebody gave you a chance,
didn't they?

42:53.595 --> 42:56.056
Yeah.
That's all Diana wants.

42:56.056 --> 42:58.391
Just a chance.

43:04.689 --> 43:06.733
♪ CHERYL LYNN: Daybreak

43:25.752 --> 43:29.005
Jeez, Sam, you weren't kidding.
She's really terrific.

44:53.840 --> 44:55.884
(APPLAUSE)

45:02.307 --> 45:05.810
What are you slapping me for?
For almost letting her get away.

45:10.190 --> 45:13.276
I got to tell you, I've never been
so glad I was wrong.

45:13.276 --> 45:15.778
She makes it?
Oh, yeah, she makes it big.

45:15.778 --> 45:18.990
In three years,
she becomes Joanna's lead dancer

45:18.990 --> 45:22.452
and she finishes high school,
which is the important part.

45:22.452 --> 45:24.579
You did it, Sam.
No, no, she did it.

45:25.914 --> 45:28.458
I was so wrong to turn you away.

45:29.709 --> 45:33.504
Then, you teach me?
Maybe we'll teach each other.

45:36.382 --> 45:40.845
Well, Sam,
uh...I think it's time to -

of mine and I'm sure one of yours.

Feelings.

46:31.479 --> 46:33.856
Yes, well,
about now would be a good time

46:33.856 --> 46:36.317

to the old cause.
