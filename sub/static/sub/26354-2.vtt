00:27.140 --> 00:29.757
Alright, another quarter, let's roll

00:31.007 --> 00:33.007
Oh yeah!

00:33.859 --> 00:36.272
I think all of this should be enough
for the dune buggy

00:36.297 --> 00:38.532
- No need to count it.
- Well, I believe you.

00:38.566 --> 00:40.868
Unfortunately, Family Funtime policy

00:40.902 --> 00:42.669
says we have to count all tickets.

00:42.704 --> 00:45.178
- Oh, come on... Trip, is it?
- Yup.

00:45.203 --> 00:46.397
You know me.

00:46.432 --> 00:48.699
I mean, you don't,
but look at this face.

00:48.743 --> 00:52.679
87. Not quite enough for the dune buggy,

00:52.704 --> 00:55.106
but you can still afford
lots of neat stuff,

00:55.140 --> 00:57.475
like this comb that only hurts a little

00:57.516 --> 01:00.185
or this ring that lights up
if you buy a battery for it.

01:00.212 --> 01:02.413
Nice try. Give me the tickets.

01:02.613 --> 01:05.150
- Look at her, boys.
- Yeah.

01:05.176 --> 01:07.573
That's the dune buggy that's
gonna save us from this life.

01:07.598 --> 01:08.753
How'd you guys do?

01:08.797 --> 01:10.998
I got ten tickets playing
the basketball game.

01:11.023 --> 01:13.658
I didn't get a lot of shots
in, but I got a ton of rebounds.

01:13.692 --> 01:15.259
Well, not a ton. Two.

01:15.294 --> 01:17.261
I played a racing game for 45 minutes

01:17.296 --> 01:19.197
before I realized I
hadn't put any money in it.

01:19.231 --> 01:20.832
Then I gave all my
quarters to a nice man

01:20.866 --> 01:22.633
who gave me a piece of pizza.

01:22.668 --> 01:25.803
Sounds like we need to make a
stop at the bank of Mom and Dad.

01:25.838 --> 01:28.439
Are they still around? I thought
they got bought out by Chase.

01:29.550 --> 01:31.108
<i>Oh, God. He's here.</i>

01:31.143 --> 01:32.577
What do we do? What do we do?

01:32.611 --> 01:34.812
Maybe we can stall him
for six or seven days.

01:34.847 --> 01:36.681
- Good plan.
- Hello, Belchers.

01:36.715 --> 01:39.884
Hi, Mr. Fischoeder. What
could you possibly want

01:39.918 --> 01:41.586
a week after the first of the month?

01:41.620 --> 01:43.788
Oh, just somebody to talk to, I guess.

01:43.822 --> 01:45.490
Aw, I'll talk to you.

01:45.524 --> 01:46.991
- I'm kidding!
- Oh.

01:47.025 --> 01:48.159
Pay your rent, please.

01:48.193 --> 01:49.393
Money. We need money.

01:49.428 --> 01:50.795
Ooh, that's why I'm here.

01:50.829 --> 01:51.896
We're money twins.

01:51.930 --> 01:53.498
That's what I call my testicles.

01:53.532 --> 01:55.399
Gene. Why do you kids need more money?

01:55.434 --> 01:57.201
We just gave you your
allowance this morning.

01:57.236 --> 01:59.470
We're trying to win the dune
buggy at Family Funtime.

01:59.505 --> 02:01.506
Oh... Family Funtime.

02:01.540 --> 02:04.075
That D-bug's got our
name written all over it.

02:04.109 --> 02:06.344
And we're gonna be the
D-bags driving that D-bug.

02:06.378 --> 02:08.189
Wait, I didn't know we
were calling it a D-bug.

02:08.213 --> 02:10.047
Is that still open for discussion?

02:10.082 --> 02:12.817
You guys know those prizes
are impossible to win

02:12.851 --> 02:15.319
without spending way more
than they're worth, right?

02:15.354 --> 02:18.055
Less talking, more ka-ching,
ka-ching, ka-ching, please.

02:18.090 --> 02:20.124
Are those supposed to be quarter sounds?

02:20.158 --> 02:21.926
They ain't dimes, bub.

02:21.960 --> 02:24.061
All right, I've got nine quarters,

02:24.104 --> 02:25.905
so that's... dollars.

02:25.931 --> 02:27.899
That's all you get. For your life.

02:27.933 --> 02:29.611
- Thank you. - Thank you.
- Bless you, Father.

02:29.635 --> 02:32.236
Huh. Now, Bob, I believe it's my turn?

02:32.271 --> 02:35.406
Okay. We can let the car leak
that stuff a little longer.

02:35.440 --> 02:38.175
Yeah, it's just oil. Comes
out of the ground, right?

02:38.210 --> 02:39.644
It's like it's going back home.

02:39.678 --> 02:41.879
Incoming! Beep-beep.

02:41.914 --> 02:44.415
You know, children,
there are certain ways

02:44.449 --> 02:47.385
of coaxing the games into
giving out more tickets.

02:47.419 --> 02:49.020
Maybe I could teach you kids some tricks

02:49.054 --> 02:50.755
that I've picked up over the years.

02:50.789 --> 02:52.690
- We're listening.
- Wait, we are?

02:52.724 --> 02:54.048
You'd be doing me a favor

02:54.073 --> 02:56.694
putting an end to that
ridiculous dune buggy promotion.

02:56.728 --> 02:58.896
I don't know. It kind of sounds
like you're talking about cheating.

02:58.931 --> 03:00.298
Not cheating.

03:00.332 --> 03:02.400
It's more like insider gaming.

03:02.434 --> 03:04.569
- What's your game?
- Johnny Snow Balls.

03:04.603 --> 03:07.538
Ah, yes. A little tip.
Aim for the Matterhorn.

03:07.573 --> 03:09.040
Okay, thanks, Mr. Fischoeder.

03:09.074 --> 03:10.919
I've been playing Johnny
Snow Balls for 20 years.

03:10.943 --> 03:12.643
I know every inch of that game,

03:12.678 --> 03:14.912
and the Matterhorn's
not where the party's at.

03:14.947 --> 03:16.814
Just give it a try.
That's all I'm saying.

03:16.848 --> 03:18.816
Okay...

03:19.391 --> 03:21.319
Bob, Linda, great news.

03:21.353 --> 03:23.220
You know how you're
always going on and on

03:23.255 --> 03:25.623
about how you love fresh
farmer's market eggs?

03:25.657 --> 03:28.326
Um, you mean that one
time, like, two weeks ago?

03:28.360 --> 03:30.928
- There you go again, on and on.
- Mm-hmm.

03:30.963 --> 03:33.497
What would you say if I told you
you could have farm fresh eggs

03:33.532 --> 03:35.593
any time you want for practically free?

03:35.618 --> 03:36.944
- I guess that sounds...
- I don't know.

03:36.969 --> 03:38.669
Great! 'Cause I got a chicken and a coop

03:38.704 --> 03:41.505
in the back of my truck. And
4,000 double "A" batteries,

03:41.540 --> 03:43.507
but that's not part of this.

03:43.542 --> 03:46.243
- Why do you have a chicken?
- I was building a fence for a guy.

03:46.278 --> 03:47.678
Pretty classic story.

03:47.713 --> 03:49.513
He runs out of cash,
pays me with a chicken.

03:49.548 --> 03:51.592
W-Wait, why don't you want it, Teddy?

03:51.617 --> 03:54.018
- My cats would kill it.
- Cats? You have cats?

03:54.052 --> 03:56.454
- Someday, when I'm ready.
- I-I-I don't know.

03:56.488 --> 03:58.222
Do we really want to
take care of a chicken?

03:58.256 --> 03:59.790
- Yes, you do.
- I think we do.

03:59.825 --> 04:01.792
Aren't they messy and stinky?

04:01.827 --> 04:03.527
Bob, our kids are messy and stinky,

04:03.562 --> 04:04.695
and we take care of them.

04:04.730 --> 04:06.530
And they don't even give us eggs.

04:07.053 --> 04:08.008
All right.

04:08.033 --> 04:09.967
- I do like fresh eggs.
- Yay!

04:10.002 --> 04:12.313
Only problem I can imagine is
you're gonna have too many eggs.

04:12.337 --> 04:14.672
Right? Uh... oh, here's an idea.

04:14.706 --> 04:17.341
We can all have breakfast
together every Sunday. Huh?

04:17.375 --> 04:18.889
- Probably not.
- Yeah, no.

04:18.914 --> 04:21.990
Sleep on it. We'll circle back when
you're feeling a little more grateful

04:22.014 --> 04:24.256
about this chicken I gave you
out of the goodness of my heart.

04:26.124 --> 04:27.985
Back again already, huh?

04:28.020 --> 04:30.554
Yeah, and this time we're
leaving with the dune buggy.

04:30.589 --> 04:33.324
That's fun. I always say I'm
going to leave with my dignity,

04:33.358 --> 04:34.892
but it never happens.

04:34.926 --> 04:38.129
Now, remember, eyes on the
prize. Ticket games only.

04:38.163 --> 04:40.865
No video games, no pizza, no ball pit.

04:40.899 --> 04:42.299
- Darn it.
- Got it.

04:42.656 --> 04:44.531
Time for the avalanche.

04:45.773 --> 04:47.371
All right, what the hell?

04:47.406 --> 04:49.140
I'll try your Matterhorn.

04:51.109 --> 04:53.377
Yeah, that's what I...

04:56.035 --> 04:57.081
Holy crap.

04:57.115 --> 04:59.684
- Gene, Tina, get over here.
- How did you do that?

04:59.718 --> 05:02.653
- Watch this.
- But that's gonna go straight into... t

05:02.688 --> 05:05.456
From the gutter to the big time,

05:05.490 --> 05:08.025
<i>just like the plastic
bag from American Beauty.</i>

05:08.060 --> 05:09.894
Guys, if we just keep
hitting the super bonus,

05:09.928 --> 05:11.796
we can actually win the... Huh?

05:11.830 --> 05:13.698
Sorry, kids. This game's out of order.

05:13.732 --> 05:15.332
What? You can't do that.

05:15.367 --> 05:17.568
If a machine starts
awarding too many tickets,

05:17.602 --> 05:20.604
Family Funtime policy says
we got to have it inspected.

05:20.639 --> 05:22.406
It's for your protection.

05:22.441 --> 05:24.375
You're the one who's
gonna need protection, pal.

05:24.409 --> 05:26.343
- Easy, girl.
- He's not worth it.

05:26.378 --> 05:28.612
If Family Funtime's not gonna play fair,

05:28.647 --> 05:30.848
then it's time for us to go Fisch-ing.

05:30.882 --> 05:32.683
I don't understand.
Why would we go fishing?

05:32.718 --> 05:34.118
I think she means we're gonna

05:34.152 --> 05:35.920
steal people's identities
on the Internet.

05:35.954 --> 05:38.022
No. We're gonna go see Mr. Fischoeder.

05:38.056 --> 05:39.657
Okay, that makes more sense.

05:39.691 --> 05:41.859
You've made a wise decision
coming to me, children.

05:41.893 --> 05:43.794
Two questions. One, are you ready

05:43.836 --> 05:46.270
- to own your own dune buggy?
- Yes. - Mm-hmm.

05:46.298 --> 05:48.799
Good. And, two, does
this make me look younger?

05:48.834 --> 05:51.302
- Yes, and also like a cheetah.
- Thought so.

05:54.266 --> 05:55.618
Why are you upset?

05:55.643 --> 05:57.611
You got a beef with Family Funtime?

05:57.645 --> 05:59.613
No, I don't mind a little
friendly competition

05:59.647 --> 06:01.648
with the Family Funtime Corporation,

06:01.683 --> 06:04.218
but this dune buggy stunt goes too far.

06:04.252 --> 06:06.553
It's putting the whole
prize economy in danger.

06:06.588 --> 06:09.423
The D-bug is putting the
prize e-con in day day?

06:09.457 --> 06:11.492
Yep. If they start
giving out dune buggies,

06:11.526 --> 06:13.660
then I have to start
giving out dune buggies.

06:13.695 --> 06:16.263
And what's next, moon buggies?

06:16.297 --> 06:17.539
Let me show you something.

06:17.799 --> 06:21.468
Now, this... this is the most
coveted prize at Wonder Wharf,

06:21.843 --> 06:23.103
the Wheelie Mammoth.

06:23.138 --> 06:24.414
Yeah, we know.

06:24.439 --> 06:26.006
Everyone knows the Wheelie Mammoth.

06:26.040 --> 06:28.308
- He's famous.
- But so down-to-earth.

06:28.343 --> 06:31.512
All you have to do to win him is
sink a ball into the golden can.

06:31.546 --> 06:33.714
Yeah, but it's an impossible shot.

06:33.748 --> 06:34.898
Not impossible.

06:34.923 --> 06:37.818
The mouth of the can is
exactly as wide as the ball.

06:37.852 --> 06:40.734
Technically, it can be
forced through. Show 'em.

06:42.265 --> 06:44.825
But no one's ever won, not once.

06:44.859 --> 06:46.660
That mammoth has been
at Wonder Wharf with me

06:46.694 --> 06:49.062
since actual mammoths roamed the Earth.

06:49.087 --> 06:52.566
He's my most beloved and
most asbestos-filled employee.

06:52.600 --> 06:55.169
In two more years, that's
what Dad'll say about me.

06:55.203 --> 06:57.771
Mm-hmm. The big prizes
have to be just good enough

06:57.806 --> 06:59.750
to get people to play.
They're about hope.

06:59.775 --> 07:01.875
That's what keeps people
coming back, you see.

07:01.910 --> 07:04.311
The Wheelie Mammoth isn't
even worth any real money.

07:04.345 --> 07:06.880
If a prize is too valuable,
like the dune buggy,

07:06.915 --> 07:08.609
the whole system breaks down.

07:08.634 --> 07:11.051
People start searching for
any flaws they can exploit.

07:11.085 --> 07:13.654
And then perfectly good games
have to be taken out of service.

07:13.688 --> 07:16.690
A boom box with a built-in,

07:16.724 --> 07:20.227
three-inch television and
all these games ended up here.

07:20.261 --> 07:23.297
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

07:23.331 --> 07:25.199
A secret arcade.

07:25.233 --> 07:28.878
It's exactly how I always
imagined Craig Kilborn's garage.

07:28.903 --> 07:31.572
Wait a minute, Family Funtime
has a bunch of these games.

07:31.606 --> 07:33.774
Exactly. That's how you're going to win.

07:33.808 --> 07:36.009
I'm going to teach you
how to beat these games.

07:36.044 --> 07:38.078
But, first, you need to assemble a crew.

07:38.112 --> 07:39.628
We are a crew. We're preassembled.

07:39.653 --> 07:42.222
- Yeah. I think the Belchers have got this.
- Here's the thing.

07:42.247 --> 07:44.195
The only way to knock
over Family Funtime

07:44.219 --> 07:45.675
is to do it in one shot.

07:45.700 --> 07:47.654
Hit 'em before they know what hit 'em.

07:47.689 --> 07:49.523
- Like a bris.
- Precisely.

07:49.557 --> 07:52.659
It's a complex job that will
require some special skills.

07:52.694 --> 07:54.828
- What kind of skills? Plumbing?
- No.

07:54.863 --> 07:56.430
- Microsoft Excel?
- No.

07:56.464 --> 07:58.398
- Oh, phew.
- All right, we're in.

07:58.433 --> 08:00.267
Great. You look like
a boy who isn't afraid

08:00.301 --> 08:02.285
of getting his hands a little sticky.

08:02.310 --> 08:05.305
I've heard of washing hands.
Doesn't seem like it's for me.

08:05.340 --> 08:06.652
You're on Bucket-Ball.

08:06.677 --> 08:09.314
You, you look like you could
shake something back and forth.

08:09.339 --> 08:10.577
Thank you?

08:10.612 --> 08:13.714
You're on the Tipsy Tulip.
Now, you just need the hammer...

08:13.748 --> 08:16.550
Hey, Zeke. My locker's stuck.
Will you do that thing again?

08:16.584 --> 08:19.386
- Yeah.
- Uh, that's not my locker.

08:19.420 --> 08:21.264
Oh, yeah.

08:21.289 --> 08:23.457
No. Remember? It's down
at the end of the hall?

08:23.491 --> 08:25.626
- Yours is next to mine.
- Oh, yeah.

08:25.660 --> 08:27.427
- Zeke.
- Huh? What's that?

08:28.199 --> 08:29.596
Do what?

08:29.631 --> 08:31.164
I'm in! Let's go!

08:31.199 --> 08:32.822
- Jimmy Jr., do you have skills?
- Yes.

08:32.847 --> 08:34.101
Great. You can come, too.

08:34.135 --> 08:35.635
<i>Next, you'll need a math whiz</i>

08:35.669 --> 08:37.270
with perfect timing.

08:37.304 --> 08:39.769
So, that's how you
tutor... Pause for a bell...

08:39.794 --> 08:41.855
Algebra.

08:42.746 --> 08:44.912
The dune buggy?
Oh, I'm in.

08:44.946 --> 08:46.546
<i>And two people who can act</i>

08:46.581 --> 08:48.782
in almost telepathic coordination.

08:48.816 --> 08:51.485
- Why won't it go?
- Maybe if we jump on it.

08:51.519 --> 08:53.453
Huh.

08:53.488 --> 08:55.032
We need your help.
We're gonna do something.

08:55.056 --> 08:57.658
We're in! This thing's broken, anyway.

08:57.692 --> 09:00.527
Once you've gathered your
crew, text me a thumbs-up emoji

09:00.561 --> 09:02.129
and we'll meet back here.

09:02.894 --> 09:04.431
This is your crew?

09:04.465 --> 09:06.500
They don't look like
much and they're not much,

09:06.534 --> 09:07.521
but I trust 'em.

09:07.546 --> 09:10.237
Even the two licking
each other's hair?

09:10.271 --> 09:12.906
Got to lick something.
Okay, listen up, everybody.

09:12.941 --> 09:14.708
You're each gonna be assigned a game.

09:14.742 --> 09:17.177
Then Mr. Fischoeder here is
gonna show you how to beat it.

09:17.410 --> 09:20.097
You, the squat one,
you're on Whack a Toe.

09:20.122 --> 09:21.858
Did he say squat?

09:21.883 --> 09:23.684
Glasses, you're on The Wheel World.

09:23.718 --> 09:25.519
- Are you gonna learn our names?
- God, no.

09:25.553 --> 09:27.955
Creepy twins, you're on
the water squirty game.

09:27.989 --> 09:30.724
- That's what we call the toilet.
- We've never won.

09:30.758 --> 09:32.526
- You, hot one.
- Aw, man.

09:32.560 --> 09:36.129
- You're on Cardiac Arrest.
- Okay. It smells weird in here.

09:36.164 --> 09:37.631
Smells weird everywhere, sir.

09:37.665 --> 09:39.032
That's how you know you're alive.

09:39.067 --> 09:41.501
We're gonna need to win 10,000 tickets

09:41.536 --> 09:44.171
without getting noticed by
the security guard at the door,

09:44.205 --> 09:46.139
by the manager behind the prize counter,

09:46.174 --> 09:49.710
or the three security cameras
located there, there, and there.

09:49.744 --> 09:52.479
The manager watches the room.
He also watches the screens.

09:52.513 --> 09:54.381
And that's why he makes the big bucks.

09:54.415 --> 09:56.750
How are we supposed
to hide 10,000 tickets?

09:56.784 --> 09:58.618
Leave that part up to
me. Now let's get to it.

09:58.653 --> 10:00.253
Clap, clap.

10:00.605 --> 10:02.856
Here we come, chicken, chicken.

10:02.890 --> 10:05.525
Coming for your
delicious bottom diamonds.

10:05.560 --> 10:08.395
How many eggs come out at
once? Like, a dozen? Two dozen?

10:08.429 --> 10:11.798
Well, it's been three days, so
there should be at least a...

10:11.833 --> 10:14.351
- Huh. Nothing.
- Maybe it's nervous.

10:14.376 --> 10:16.380
You know, like how you
can't poop when we travel?

10:16.404 --> 10:17.738
Wait, when did we travel?

10:17.772 --> 10:19.573
Well, I was just imagining, you know.

10:19.607 --> 10:22.209
- If we did, you wouldn't be able to poop.
- I could poop.

10:22.243 --> 10:24.177
I'd like to maybe even
think I could poop better.

10:24.212 --> 10:26.079
Like, in Europe, I could poop better.

10:26.604 --> 10:28.015
Boo!

10:28.049 --> 10:29.883
- What was that?
- I was trying to scare it.

10:29.917 --> 10:31.517
You know, if there was an
egg in there about to drop,

10:31.542 --> 10:32.586
I'd scare it out.

10:32.620 --> 10:34.354
I don't think that's how it works.

10:34.389 --> 10:36.656
Well, what's your big
idea, Colonel Sanders?

10:36.691 --> 10:39.226
I don't know. Maybe the
opposite of what you just did?

10:39.260 --> 10:42.196
- Maybe sing to it?
- Ooh, singing! Yes, yes, yes!

10:42.221 --> 10:43.497
<i>♪ Make an egg roll ♪</i>

10:43.531 --> 10:45.042
<i>- ♪ From your egg hole... ♪
- No, no, no.</i>

10:45.066 --> 10:47.034
- That's really loud.
- That was good.

10:47.068 --> 10:48.545
She doesn't like that kind of singing.

10:48.569 --> 10:49.936
- Why?
- She likes this.

10:49.971 --> 10:54.618
<i>♪ Amazing Grace ♪</i>

10:54.643 --> 10:56.276
♪ How sweet... ♪

10:56.310 --> 10:57.911
No, no, no, you're putting her to sleep.

10:57.945 --> 11:00.280
<i>♪ Make an egg roll
from your egg hole ♪</i>

11:00.314 --> 11:02.482
- ♪ That saved ♪
- ♪ We're gonna beat it ♪

11:02.517 --> 11:04.395
- ♪ A wretch... ♪
- ♪ And then we'll eat it... ♪

11:04.419 --> 11:06.653
Zeke, how's it coming on Whack a Toe?

11:06.687 --> 11:08.321
Well, I'm working on this move.

11:08.356 --> 11:10.757
Mallet! Head! Mallet, head, go! Mallet!

11:10.792 --> 11:12.592
- Does that hurt?
- Does what hurt?

11:12.627 --> 11:14.304
Oh, they're not real
toes. They don't feel pain.

11:14.328 --> 11:16.363
Okay. Darryl, how's
the Wheel World going?

11:16.397 --> 11:17.831
Are you mastering the pattern?

11:17.865 --> 11:20.108
Yup. The light rotates
in a specific algorithm,

11:20.133 --> 11:21.601
depending on where it starts.

11:21.636 --> 11:23.914
Once you spot the pattern, you
just wait for the final loop

11:23.938 --> 11:26.406
and then three, two, one, hee-ya!

11:26.441 --> 11:28.708
- So that's math, huh?
- Hmm.

11:28.743 --> 11:30.744
Andy, Ollie, show me what you got.

11:30.778 --> 11:32.446
I've got an innie, he's got an outie.

11:32.480 --> 11:33.880
They fit together.

11:33.915 --> 11:35.982
- I meant the game.
- Oh.

11:37.852 --> 11:39.920
Nice work. Twice as nice

11:39.954 --> 11:41.298
if you can do it a hundred more times.

11:41.322 --> 11:42.989
Oh, that's a lot.

11:43.024 --> 11:45.461
- Hey, Tina, how's it shaking?
- Pretty much like this.

11:48.029 --> 11:49.629
- That's it, huh?
- Yeah, that's it.

11:49.664 --> 11:51.431
Can I switch to a different... Oh.

11:51.466 --> 11:52.992
Okay, talk to you later.

11:54.687 --> 11:56.169
Saturday is the busiest day

11:56.204 --> 11:58.538
for birthday parties at Family Funtime.

11:58.573 --> 12:00.574
That means their staff
is gonna be too busy

12:00.608 --> 12:02.576
to go around pulling plugs on you.

12:02.610 --> 12:05.112
But we're gonna have to keep
our ticket count under wraps.

12:05.146 --> 12:06.913
So, remember, when
your backpack is full,

12:06.948 --> 12:08.482
slide it through the curtain to me

12:08.516 --> 12:10.650
in the photo booth
and I'll empty it out.

12:10.685 --> 12:12.961
We know, Louise. We've
been practicing all day.

12:12.986 --> 12:14.063
Can we go home now?

12:14.088 --> 12:16.289
Yeah, everything's starting
to look like a toe to me.

12:16.324 --> 12:17.858
- There's one!
- Ow, Zeke!

12:17.892 --> 12:19.593
All right, fine. Go home and rest up.

12:19.627 --> 12:21.661
Big day tomorrow. Keep
it to one nightcap, hmm?

12:21.696 --> 12:24.464
One jigger of gin per
pound of body weight.

12:24.499 --> 12:26.166
You guys head on home.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.108
I'm gonna stop by Family
Funtime real quick,

12:28.133 --> 12:30.370
do a final walk-through,
check all the sight lines.

12:30.404 --> 12:32.282
I don't know, Louise. We're
supposed to be laying low.

12:32.306 --> 12:34.307
- Sounds kind of risky.
- Yeah, well, I don't want

12:34.342 --> 12:36.710
to leave anything to
chance. Relax. Go home.

12:36.744 --> 12:39.086
I'll be back before Gene
eats his first dinner.

12:39.111 --> 12:41.946
It's not a dinner...
It's a cheese course.

12:47.188 --> 12:49.789
Dune buggy's still there,
games are all in service,

12:49.824 --> 12:52.159
photo booth is... Wait, what the...

12:52.193 --> 12:53.570
What's up with the
curtain on the photo booth?

12:53.594 --> 12:55.028
It's-it's missing.

12:55.062 --> 12:56.491
Eh, it's at the cleaners.

12:56.516 --> 12:58.517
It can only absorb so much vomit

12:58.551 --> 13:00.152
before the smell becomes a problem.

13:00.186 --> 13:01.653
It'll be back in a few days.

13:01.688 --> 13:03.088
A few days?

13:03.122 --> 13:04.656
You really like that curtain, huh?

13:04.691 --> 13:06.625
Yeah, what can I say, I'm a kid.

13:06.659 --> 13:08.660
And, uh, kids, uh, they love curtains.

13:08.695 --> 13:10.229
He he, sure, sure.

13:10.263 --> 13:12.164
Back in my day, it was blinds.

13:12.198 --> 13:15.703
Damn it, now we need somewhere
else to stash the tickets.

13:16.069 --> 13:17.302
I've got to find a blind spot.

13:17.337 --> 13:19.338
Hey, uh, I think

13:19.372 --> 13:21.573
someone tried to flush a
Skee-Ball down the toilet.

13:21.608 --> 13:23.408
At least, I hope it's a Skee-Ball.

13:23.443 --> 13:26.445
Oh! To what end, people?

13:29.422 --> 13:31.183
Come on, show me a blind spot.

13:31.217 --> 13:33.797
Hey! You're not allowed
behind the prize counter. lo

13:33.822 --> 13:36.021
Unless, I was looking for the staircase.

13:36.055 --> 13:39.024
Oh! There it is.

13:39.058 --> 13:40.726
Nice try.

13:40.760 --> 13:42.895
Yuli, we've got a thief.

13:42.929 --> 13:44.672
Turn. Ra

13:44.697 --> 13:47.543
Now your picture goes up on
the Bulletin Board of Banishment

13:47.567 --> 13:50.302
so myself and the other
security guards will make sure

13:50.336 --> 13:53.523
you are not admitted into
Family Funtime ever again,

13:53.657 --> 13:55.648
again, again...

13:55.673 --> 13:58.119
I'm doing that echo thing
for dramatic purposes.

13:58.144 --> 14:01.804
- Yep.
- Time to get out, out, out...

14:01.829 --> 14:03.282
All right, I'm going.

14:03.316 --> 14:06.828
She'll land on her feet.
Or turn to drugs and crime.

14:12.524 --> 14:14.691
- What's the emergency?
- Look, here's what happened.

14:14.726 --> 14:16.756
- We were...
- We? No, you.

14:16.781 --> 14:18.328
You blew it. You got caught.

14:18.363 --> 14:19.774
Louise got banned from Family Funtime.

14:19.798 --> 14:21.331
What? You got banned?

14:21.366 --> 14:23.434
I was checking to make
sure everything was smooth

14:23.468 --> 14:25.536
for tomorrow, which it wasn't.

14:25.570 --> 14:27.838
I had to find a new place
to stash the tickets.

14:27.879 --> 14:30.681
So I smartly went behind
the prize counter...

14:30.715 --> 14:32.349
And she got caught. The manager thought

14:32.377 --> 14:33.977
she was trying to steal prizes.

14:34.012 --> 14:35.479
Reckless, that's the word.

14:35.513 --> 14:37.448
Also selfish and dumb.

14:37.482 --> 14:39.650
People, if I hadn't gone last night,

14:39.684 --> 14:41.652
this who thing would've fallen apart.

14:41.686 --> 14:44.288
Whoa. Everybody, just slow down, okay?

14:44.322 --> 14:46.457
Take a deep breath
and a slug of bourbon.

14:46.491 --> 14:49.159
We'll find a way to sneak
Louise into Family Funtime.

14:49.194 --> 14:51.895
I don't know. I hate to say it, Louise,

14:51.930 --> 14:54.498
but I think maybe it's
safer if you stay behind.

14:54.532 --> 14:56.667
Sorry, Louise, I guess
you're out of the crew.

14:56.701 --> 14:59.670
Yeah, well, g-good luck
pulling this off without me.

14:59.704 --> 15:01.705
Crew you guys. Crew all of you!

15:01.739 --> 15:03.013
Hmm.

15:03.045 --> 15:06.383
Hmm, I guess someone else will
have to be tiny and bossy.

15:06.411 --> 15:08.045
Uh, what about you? What've you got?

15:08.079 --> 15:09.246
I can smile.

15:09.280 --> 15:10.681
Never mind. What about you?

15:10.715 --> 15:13.550
- I know how everybody's gonna die.
- Okay, forget it.

15:14.286 --> 15:16.186
- Still hasn't laid an egg, huh?
- No.

15:16.221 --> 15:18.021
What kind of chicken
did you give us, Teddy?

15:18.056 --> 15:20.621
It's a poor craftsman who takes
it out on his chicken, Bob.

15:20.646 --> 15:23.727
Linda, no! She's young!
She hasn't figured it out yet.

15:23.761 --> 15:25.195
Teddy, I'm just holding a knife.

15:25.230 --> 15:27.197
- We work in a restaurant.
- Oh.

15:27.232 --> 15:29.600
But have I thought about eating chicken?

15:29.634 --> 15:31.479
Yes. Yes, I have.

15:31.504 --> 15:32.836
I've got a few recipes bookmarked.

15:32.871 --> 15:35.580
- Yeah. Me, too.
- Stop! You people are monsters.

15:35.605 --> 15:36.740
Rosemary chicken,

15:36.774 --> 15:38.408
- barbeque chicken sandwich...
- Oh!

15:38.443 --> 15:39.943
- Garlic chicken...
- Oh!

15:39.978 --> 15:41.845
- Yum.
- That sounds good, actually.

15:41.880 --> 15:44.214
♪

15:51.043 --> 15:53.190
Oh, no, my hands are all sticky.

15:53.746 --> 15:56.014
And now the ball is all sticky.

15:57.629 --> 15:58.929
That's weird.

16:06.437 --> 16:08.939
Yeah! I mean... Yeah.

16:19.371 --> 16:21.818
Ooh, ooh. That's my whistle sound.

16:21.853 --> 16:23.820
I don't know how to whistle, Tina.

16:23.996 --> 16:25.348
Don't think about all the pee in here.

16:25.404 --> 16:26.548
Don't think about all the pee in here.

16:26.573 --> 16:28.053
Don't think about all the pee in here.

16:33.207 --> 16:34.335
Uh-oh.

16:35.020 --> 16:36.494
Dang! You come out of there.

16:36.519 --> 16:38.153
I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you.

16:40.590 --> 16:43.846
Jeepers. How many tickets
do you kids have in here?

16:43.967 --> 16:45.104
The normal amount?

16:45.129 --> 16:47.354
I can't believe you kids would cheat.

16:47.379 --> 16:48.979
It's called Family Funtime,

16:49.004 --> 16:52.229
not H-Horrible Greedy
Children Cheat Time.

16:52.254 --> 16:55.686
What?! We were playing totally fair.
Like, maybe too fair.

16:55.720 --> 16:58.495
Ah, well, we'll see what
the boss says about that.

16:58.520 --> 16:59.489
Here he is now.

17:00.848 --> 17:02.125
Hello, children.

17:02.910 --> 17:04.962
Mr. Fischoeder? What are you doing here?

17:04.996 --> 17:06.530
Oh, did I forget to mention?

17:06.564 --> 17:09.316
I'm part owner of Family Funtime.

17:09.939 --> 17:11.652
Yeah, I think you did.

17:14.464 --> 17:16.815
Wait, Mr Fischoeder

17:16.848 --> 17:18.184
to cheat at your own arcade?

17:18.209 --> 17:20.318
I'm sure I have no idea
what you're talking about.

17:20.343 --> 17:22.877
Anyway, these are the types
of cheaters I was worried about

17:22.912 --> 17:25.281
Grubby, grubby little
ones. Sorry, I'm being rude.

17:25.315 --> 17:27.650
Uh, this is one of
my so-called partners.

17:27.684 --> 17:30.653
We're actual partners,
not so-called partners.

17:30.687 --> 17:31.998
None of the partners
like it when you call them

17:32.022 --> 17:33.589
so-called partners.

17:33.623 --> 17:35.301
They were about to try
and claim the dune buggy.

17:35.325 --> 17:36.925
It's a good thing I was expecting this

17:36.960 --> 17:38.394
and was able to catch them.

17:38.428 --> 17:40.029
But you taught us to cheat.

17:40.063 --> 17:41.997
Yeah, you did. Are you dirty dogging us?

17:42.032 --> 17:44.933
I've never seen you before in
my long and prosperous life.

17:44.968 --> 17:46.935
Well, you were right about this, Calvin.

17:46.970 --> 17:48.971
That dune buggy is a liability.

17:49.005 --> 17:50.973
It's too valuable.
If it can be won here,

17:51.007 --> 17:53.809
it can be won at all of
our participating locations.

17:53.843 --> 17:55.678
Wh-What's gonna happen
to the dune buggy?

17:55.712 --> 17:57.946
I guess I'll drive
it back to the office.

17:57.981 --> 17:59.982
Thank God we built it
next to those dunes.

18:00.016 --> 18:01.483
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.

18:01.518 --> 18:03.268
Looks like things went
pretty smoothly, huh?

18:03.293 --> 18:04.520
Yeah. Piece of cake.

18:04.554 --> 18:06.255
- How'd it go on your end?
- I nailed it.

18:06.289 --> 18:08.501
What are you kids talking
about? Why are you being chummy?

18:08.525 --> 18:10.125
Why aren't you distraught?

18:10.160 --> 18:12.761
You're not supposed to
be here. You're banned.

18:12.796 --> 18:14.630
Yeah, little breakdown in security.

18:14.664 --> 18:16.999
- There's no one out there.
- Oh, shoot, that's me.

18:17.033 --> 18:19.101
I'll go back out, you
try to walk in again.

18:19.135 --> 18:21.670
Hold on. I would like to
know what's happening here.

18:21.705 --> 18:23.939
Well, you see, Mr. F, it was yesterday,

18:23.973 --> 18:26.975
while Yuli was taking that
very flattering picture of me,

18:27.010 --> 18:29.311
that I realized you were setting us up.

18:29.346 --> 18:33.949
And how, pray tell, did you
realize that so not true thing?

18:34.411 --> 18:36.452
<i>Because right next to the Bulletin Board</i>

18:36.486 --> 18:39.589
<i>of Banishment is a really
fun collection of pictures</i>

18:39.614 --> 18:43.692
<i>from the Family Funtime company picnic.</i>

18:43.727 --> 18:46.028
Damn it. Good picnic,
though. Great punch.

18:46.062 --> 18:47.996
When I saw that, I
realized there was no way

18:48.031 --> 18:49.365
we were getting that dune buggy.

18:49.399 --> 18:51.100
After I broke the news to the crew,

18:51.134 --> 18:53.001
<i>we all agreed we weren't
going to walk away</i>

18:53.036 --> 18:54.570
<i>from this empty-handed.</i>

18:54.604 --> 18:56.672
<i>So while this decoy heist was underway,</i>

18:56.706 --> 18:59.541
<i>the real heist was
going on at the wharf.</i>

18:59.576 --> 19:01.410
<i>- My wharf?
- Yup.</i>

19:01.444 --> 19:04.346
We pulled a heist of our
own to win the unwinnable.

19:04.381 --> 19:06.014
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, not...

19:06.049 --> 19:08.350
My Wheelie Mammoth?

19:08.385 --> 19:11.587
But how did... I d... I don't...
What the... ? It's unwinnable.

19:11.621 --> 19:14.323
- Thanks to you, it became winnable.
- What?

19:14.357 --> 19:16.759
Turns out you taught us
everything we needed to know

19:16.793 --> 19:18.767
to land us a mammoth.

19:19.664 --> 19:21.899
<i>Sticky hands.</i>

19:23.075 --> 19:25.210
<i>Timing.</i>

19:27.572 --> 19:29.438
<i>Shaking.</i>

19:29.472 --> 19:31.283
<i>And the hammer.</i>

19:31.875 --> 19:34.743
- Yes! Yes! Yes!
- Ah! She got it in!

19:34.778 --> 19:37.746
She got it in! Somebody won the mammoth!

19:37.781 --> 19:40.382
How come no one's excited but me?

19:40.424 --> 19:43.407
So, while we may not be
taking home the dune buggy...

19:43.799 --> 19:46.555
Sorry! I didn't know
how loud it was gonna be.

19:46.589 --> 19:48.524
Is it loud there? It's loud here.

19:48.558 --> 19:50.359
... we did get the next best thing:

19:50.393 --> 19:53.103
the most coveted prize
in all of Wonder Wharf.

19:53.385 --> 19:54.630
Well played.

19:54.664 --> 19:56.899
Well played, all of you.

19:56.933 --> 19:58.934
I'm going to miss that mammoth.

19:58.968 --> 20:01.470
Do me a favor, brush him every
once in a while, will you?

20:01.504 --> 20:03.472
And oil his wheels. I
never did any oi that stuff,

20:03.506 --> 20:04.973
but I always meant to.

20:05.008 --> 20:07.443
Come on, so-called partner, let's race.

20:07.477 --> 20:08.944
Yeah, ha, ha!

20:08.978 --> 20:10.579
Son of a gun, look at him go.

20:10.613 --> 20:11.931
Wait, let's trade!

20:13.596 --> 20:15.851
- You really think this is gonna work?
- No.

20:15.885 --> 20:18.120
Well, it can't hurt, anyway.
We tried everything else.

20:18.154 --> 20:19.955
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, guys, look.

20:19.989 --> 20:21.256
Whoa.

20:21.291 --> 20:23.125
Half Wheelie Mammoth, half chicken.

20:23.159 --> 20:24.760
All frittata.

20:24.794 --> 20:27.463
Sheesh. Remember how
easy it was to buy eggs?

20:27.497 --> 20:29.798
I miss that. I miss us.

20:29.833 --> 20:31.343
I wonder if Teddy
knows any other suckers

20:31.367 --> 20:32.568
who would take a chicken.

20:32.602 --> 20:33.769
And maybe a mammoth, too?

20:33.803 --> 20:35.137
You bite your tongue.

20:35.171 --> 20:36.772
That mammoth is part of the family now.

20:36.806 --> 20:38.207
Louise, it's huge.

20:38.241 --> 20:39.942
- Where are we gonna put it?
- Right there.

20:39.976 --> 20:41.143
But we can't see the TV.

20:41.177 --> 20:42.611
This is what we watch now.

20:42.645 --> 20:43.946
We watch mammoth and chicken.

20:43.980 --> 20:45.481
Yeah, okay.

20:45.515 --> 20:47.610
So are we gonna eat
that mamma-jamma or what?

20:47.635 --> 20:50.252
I-I mean the egg, not the
chicken. Or the mammoth.

20:50.286 --> 20:52.154
<i>I know "mamma-jamma"
sounded like a fun way</i>

20:52.188 --> 20:54.656
<i>to say "mammoth," but I
didn't mean it that way.</i>

20:54.691 --> 20:56.492
<i>- But I am hungry.
- All right!</i>

20:56.526 --> 20:58.627

one-egg omelet five ways?</i>
