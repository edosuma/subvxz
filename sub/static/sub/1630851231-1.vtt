12:07.927 --> 12:09.128
at her friend Sophie's
apartment

12:09.195 --> 12:10.496
on the Upper West Side.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.164
We need to find her right away.

12:12.231 --> 12:13.399
She might be in danger,

12:13.466 --> 12:16.435
and she might have information
relating to Nicole's murder.

12:16.502 --> 12:18.270
So let's go to work
and find this girl.

12:18.337 --> 12:19.438
Hey, you hear from Julia's mom?

12:19.505 --> 12:21.240
- Yeah, I just spoke to her.
She doesn't know anything.

12:21.307 --> 12:22.975
She hasn't even heard from her.

12:23.042 --> 12:24.143
- Okay, what about
Julia's phone?

12:24.210 --> 12:26.178
Her phone's been shut off
since 7:45 a.m. this morning.

12:26.245 --> 12:27.413
Looks like she's trying
to get off the grid.

12:27.480 --> 12:30.216
- So if the friend, Sophie,
really was telling the truth,

12:30.282 --> 12:32.084
and Julia was getting paid
to have sex

12:32.151 --> 12:33.219
at "rich people parties"--

12:33.285 --> 12:34.987
- Means Nicole was her pimp.

12:35.054 --> 12:36.489
- Right, which begs
the question,

12:36.555 --> 12:39.258
was Nicole exploiting
other young girls as well?

12:39.325 --> 12:40.826
- We don't have any proof,
but I'm guessing

12:40.893 --> 12:42.361
the answer's yes.

12:42.428 --> 12:45.064
- So is this why Nicole
was murdered?

12:45.131 --> 12:46.866
Or is it just
a disgusting side note

12:46.932 --> 12:47.967

Right.

Okay, uh.

13:05.117 --> 13:07.419
Few months ago, I was working
the tip line,

13:07.486 --> 13:09.155
and I got a phone call
from a young girl,

13:09.221 --> 13:12.191
16 years old,
said her name was Madison.

13:12.258 --> 13:14.293
And she was receiving money
to sleep with rich guys.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.962
She would meet them
at a restaurant in Soho

13:17.029 --> 13:18.364
called Spino's,
and then she would go off

13:18.430 --> 13:20.466

after.

13:20.533 --> 13:22.268
I started asking her
more questions,

13:22.334 --> 13:24.036
and she got nervous
and hung up.

13:24.103 --> 13:25.204
- Did you investigate?

13:25.271 --> 13:28.474
- I tried, but nobody
knew anything.

13:28.541 --> 13:29.942
- Well, look, technically,
she didn't

13:30.009 --> 13:31.210
even report a federal crime.

13:31.277 --> 13:32.811
I mean, most agents would have
taken that call

13:32.878 --> 13:34.046
and told her to call NYPD,

13:34.113 --> 13:35.214
not even given it
a second thought.

13:35.281 --> 13:36.815
- Yeah, but I could have--

13:36.882 --> 13:38.484
could have pulled video
from the neighborhood,

13:38.551 --> 13:40.352
I could have set up a pole cam
outside of the restaurant.

13:40.419 --> 13:42.988
- Yeah, and diverted resources
from active investigations

13:43.055 --> 13:45.291

and evidence.
