WEBVTT

00:01.294 --> 00:02.921
Previously on "The 100"...

00:03.129 --> 00:05.215
This thing doesn't care
what clan you're from.

00:05.423 --> 00:08.802
It controls people
one person at a time

00:09.010 --> 00:10.595
until there
is no one left.

00:10.804 --> 00:12.639
The only way to stop her
is to get the information

00:12.847 --> 00:14.683
off the flame, and
the only way to do that

00:14.891 --> 00:16.351
is to put it
in Ontari's head.

00:16.559 --> 00:17.852
It's a kill switch.

00:18.061 --> 00:20.230
If I can get this to work,
I can kill Alie.

00:20.438 --> 00:21.815
Jasper's
been chipped.

00:22.023 --> 00:23.358
All you have to do
is destroy the machine,

00:23.566 --> 00:25.694
and she'll be fine,
promise.

00:25.902 --> 00:27.821
Lincoln is dead.

00:29.239 --> 00:31.366
He was my home.

00:31.574 --> 00:32.784
Until
we find it a host,

00:32.993 --> 00:33.994
we won't know
how to stop Alie.

00:34.202 --> 00:35.537
Then let's
find it a host.

00:35.745 --> 00:37.205
We can't let them
have you.

00:37.414 --> 00:39.082
No!

00:42.669 --> 00:43.545
Uh!

00:44.921 --> 00:48.758
She's brain dead.
It's over.

00:48.967 --> 00:50.427
We're
trapped here.

00:59.602 --> 01:01.980
Aah! Aah!

01:02.188 --> 01:05.650
Agh! Uhh!

01:05.859 --> 01:07.986
Uh...Uh...

01:18.371 --> 01:20.832
Mom?

01:22.542 --> 01:23.460
Can you hear me?

01:25.587 --> 01:28.006
I know
you're in there.

01:28.214 --> 01:29.507
Come back to me. Heh.

01:32.635 --> 01:35.472
I need you.

01:38.099 --> 01:40.060
Ha!

01:41.269 --> 01:42.312
Hi.

01:42.520 --> 01:44.606
- Clarke.
- Yeah. Ha ha!

01:44.814 --> 01:46.649
You're OK.
You're OK. Here.

01:48.485 --> 01:50.904
Oh...

02:03.583 --> 02:05.126
- Oh, no.
- No, no, no, no, no.

02:05.335 --> 02:06.920
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

02:07.128 --> 02:09.172
I'm so sorry.

02:14.260 --> 02:15.804
It's OK.

02:21.267 --> 02:22.393
Hey, stop.

02:22.602 --> 02:24.395
- I'm sorry.
- It wasn't you.

02:24.604 --> 02:25.897
No, no, no, no, no.

02:26.106 --> 02:27.899
No. It wasn't you.

02:28.108 --> 02:31.277
- Mom...
- No.

02:31.486 --> 02:33.696
I need your help.

02:37.826 --> 02:39.786
Hey, no. It's OK.

02:39.994 --> 02:43.832
I used the EMP
She's back.

02:44.040 --> 02:45.458
W-w-well, what
about Ontari?

02:45.667 --> 02:46.668
Thought you said
we had one shot

02:46.876 --> 02:47.877
with that thing.

02:48.086 --> 02:49.587
I told you,

02:49.796 --> 02:52.215
Ontari's no longer
an option for the flame.

02:52.423 --> 02:56.261
She's brain dead.
Is the floor secure?

02:56.469 --> 02:59.055
For now. Jaha and the guards
are tied up in a bedroom.

02:59.264 --> 03:00.598
We took out
the elevator

03:00.807 --> 03:02.183
and the ladder
as we climbed.

03:02.392 --> 03:04.435
The stairs are collapsed.
No one's following us.

03:04.644 --> 03:05.770
Good.
Then we have time.

03:05.979 --> 03:07.397
What we don't have
is a way down.

03:07.605 --> 03:09.357
Time for what?

03:09.524 --> 03:11.151
An ascension
ceremony.

03:11.359 --> 03:13.945
Ascension? You just said
Ontari wasn't an option.

03:14.154 --> 03:16.239
Besides, she's still chipped,
and we no longer have an EMP

03:16.447 --> 03:19.659
We're not putting
the flame in Ontari's head.

03:19.868 --> 03:22.871
We're putting it
in mine.

03:25.456 --> 03:29.711
Clarke, that thing
killed Emerson in seconds,

03:29.919 --> 03:31.629
liquefied his brain.

03:31.838 --> 03:34.299
Emerson wasn't connected
to a Nightblood.

03:34.507 --> 03:37.302
- Transfusion?
- Not exactly.

03:37.510 --> 03:40.597
Connected like
mount weather.

03:42.265 --> 03:45.560
Yes. Everything we need
is in your med kit.

03:45.768 --> 03:47.353
No. It's too
dangerous,

03:47.562 --> 03:48.605
and there are
too many variables.

03:48.813 --> 03:51.232
But no options.

03:51.441 --> 03:54.444
Whatever you're doing,
you better do it fast.

03:54.652 --> 03:56.738
Why?
What happened?

03:56.946 --> 03:59.240
They're climbing.

04:33.191 --> 04:35.860
I have to do this.

04:38.029 --> 04:40.949
OK. I'll help you.

05:28.246 --> 05:30.581
Ah!
Oh! Huh! Ah!

05:30.790 --> 05:32.959
Uh!

05:37.630 --> 05:40.049
Guys, you're
running out of time.

05:40.258 --> 05:42.218
What's it gonna be,
raven's machine or Harper?

05:42.427 --> 05:44.846
Don't give it
to them. Uh!

05:46.014 --> 05:48.057
Just keep
him talking.

05:48.266 --> 05:50.226
Stop. There's
no reason to hurt her.

05:50.435 --> 05:52.478
You can stop it.
Just open the door.

05:52.687 --> 05:53.980
And if we do that,
then what,

05:54.188 --> 05:56.024
we get chipped,
anyway?

05:58.109 --> 05:59.736
Raven, your chances
of reaching

05:59.944 --> 06:01.988
the kill switch again
are less than 2%.

06:02.196 --> 06:04.782
I've added
additional security.

06:04.991 --> 06:06.826
I know the digital
signature of the chip

06:07.035 --> 06:09.078
that Hannah
gave to Monty.

06:09.287 --> 06:11.539
The moment you use
the portal to interact

06:11.748 --> 06:16.085
with anything within
my code, I will know.

06:16.294 --> 06:18.338
I will find you.

06:18.546 --> 06:20.048
Uh...

06:20.256 --> 06:21.924
Are you really willing
to let your friend die

06:22.133 --> 06:23.718
for a 2% chance?

06:23.926 --> 06:24.844
What do you think?

06:26.262 --> 06:27.555
Uh!

06:27.764 --> 06:28.848
Uh!

06:32.518 --> 06:34.395
- You OK?
- Yeah.

06:36.064 --> 06:38.566
Good thing there's no pain
in the city of light.

06:43.154 --> 06:44.197
Ah...

06:53.748 --> 06:55.958
Balcony's greased.

06:56.167 --> 06:58.211
No one's getting in
through here.

06:58.419 --> 06:59.587
Good. There enough
lamp oil

06:59.754 --> 07:00.880
to cover every
window on the floor

07:01.089 --> 07:02.548
except the
commander's chambers.

07:02.757 --> 07:04.675
Then that's where
the fighting starts.

07:04.884 --> 07:07.178
We'll dig in there.

07:11.432 --> 07:12.392
O.

07:15.812 --> 07:17.855
Be careful.

07:21.526 --> 07:23.486
We're all set.

07:27.740 --> 07:30.618
OK. You ready?

07:30.827 --> 07:33.287
Yeah.

08:01.399 --> 08:04.819
Hey, try doing that
hanging upside down.

08:09.407 --> 08:11.284
This will work.

08:12.618 --> 08:14.120
And if it doesn't?

08:14.328 --> 08:16.164
If it doesn't work,
then she dies.

08:16.372 --> 08:17.790
If she doesn't try, then she
dies with the rest of us

08:17.999 --> 08:19.584
when the climbers
get here.

08:19.792 --> 08:21.335
If we're gonna do this,
I need the flame.

08:21.502 --> 08:25.047
Mom, please.
He knows what he's doing.

08:25.256 --> 08:28.468
You have to let me go.

08:36.058 --> 08:37.894
Lean forward.

08:42.982 --> 08:45.651
- You ready?
- Yeah. Do it.

08:45.860 --> 08:47.820
Ascende superius.

08:54.410 --> 08:56.954
Uh! Uh! Aah!

08:57.163 --> 08:59.373
Uh! Aah!

09:01.792 --> 09:02.960
No, no, no.

09:05.046 --> 09:07.965
- She OK?
- Her heart's racing.

09:08.174 --> 09:11.552
Get that thing
out of her head.

09:11.761 --> 09:13.888
I said, get that
thing out of her head!

09:15.681 --> 09:19.185
No. No...

09:19.393 --> 09:20.937
Not yet.

09:21.145 --> 09:23.397
Are you
in any pain?

09:23.606 --> 09:29.403
No. I'm OK.
I know how to stop Alie.

09:31.155 --> 09:33.699
I have to take
the chip.

09:33.908 --> 09:35.576
What?

09:35.785 --> 09:37.828
I have to go into
the city of light

09:38.037 --> 09:39.789
and find
the kill switch.

09:39.997 --> 09:42.333
Yeah. That sounds
like a great idea.

09:42.542 --> 09:46.754
Clarke, listen to me.
Alie wants the flame.

09:46.963 --> 09:49.549
If you take the chip,
you're giving it to her.

09:49.757 --> 09:51.842
The second
someone sees you,

09:52.051 --> 09:53.970
Alie is gonna know
that you're there.

09:56.389 --> 09:59.559
She'll kill you.

09:59.767 --> 10:02.728
If your mind dies,
you die.

10:04.063 --> 10:06.983
The flame
will protect me.

10:09.860 --> 10:13.614
I don't know how I know.
I just...Know.

10:17.243 --> 10:19.620
I believe you.

10:22.498 --> 10:24.834
Do you even know
what you're looking for?

10:25.042 --> 10:26.294
I'll know
when I find it.

10:33.676 --> 10:36.512
May we meet again.

10:36.721 --> 10:38.139
We will.

10:38.306 --> 10:40.975
We'll keep
you safe.

12:18.072 --> 12:21.158
Hey.

12:21.367 --> 12:22.952
Good to see you.

12:31.544 --> 12:33.587
Jasper?

12:35.840 --> 12:37.049
What--

12:38.676 --> 12:40.428
they can't see me.

12:52.148 --> 12:53.941
Clarke...

12:54.150 --> 12:56.193
Clarke...

13:27.808 --> 13:30.978
- You're burning up.
- I'm fine.

13:35.107 --> 13:37.526
Wound is infected.

13:40.696 --> 13:43.032
I'm sorry about
the way things happened.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.201
That was
another war.

13:45.409 --> 13:47.536
Better take him
to Abby.

13:47.745 --> 13:49.663
Copy that.
I'll come right back.

13:52.583 --> 13:55.044
I'm not letting
you fight alone.

13:55.252 --> 13:57.254
He won't
be alone.

13:58.422 --> 14:00.508
You see? Come on.

14:07.556 --> 14:09.350
If we're gonna
survive this,

14:09.558 --> 14:11.644
we'll need
to stand together.

14:11.852 --> 14:13.896
Now you say that.

14:19.193 --> 14:21.320
Damn,
that was fast.

14:23.072 --> 14:24.990
Here they come.

14:26.367 --> 14:28.619
OK. The first
wave is small.

14:28.828 --> 14:30.454
We do this
your brother's way.

14:30.663 --> 14:31.664
We let them in.
We take them down.

14:31.872 --> 14:34.708
We tie them up.
Clear?

14:41.715 --> 14:44.051
Rrgh!

14:44.260 --> 14:46.554
Aah! Ah!

14:46.762 --> 14:48.097
- Uh! Uh!
- Uh!

14:48.305 --> 14:49.932
- Uh!
- Oh!

14:54.979 --> 14:58.190
You left her
with pike?

15:01.735 --> 15:03.863
Uh! Ooh! Uh!

15:04.071 --> 15:05.573
Uh!

15:05.781 --> 15:08.826
- Uh!
- O., what are you doing?

15:09.952 --> 15:11.537
Bellamy, no.

15:13.581 --> 15:14.748
Uh!

15:14.957 --> 15:17.418
Uh! Ah!

15:17.626 --> 15:20.838
Come on.
Can you stand?

15:21.046 --> 15:23.841
She cut me.

15:25.050 --> 15:27.636
Come on.
We got to go.

15:27.845 --> 15:30.180
- But we can't give up the room.
- We already have.

15:31.515 --> 15:32.474
Uh!

15:37.563 --> 15:38.856
Help me.

15:39.064 --> 15:40.232
I told you, you need
to get yourself

15:40.441 --> 15:42.985
under control if we're
gonna survive this.

15:43.193 --> 15:44.987
Uh!

15:45.195 --> 15:46.614
Uh!

15:48.824 --> 15:52.119
O.?
O., listen to me.

15:52.328 --> 15:54.079
I know how you feel.

15:54.288 --> 15:55.581
I let my need
for revenge

15:55.789 --> 15:57.541
put me on
the wrong side.

15:57.750 --> 15:59.585
I don't want
that for you.

16:01.879 --> 16:03.714
Uh!

16:03.923 --> 16:06.342
Uh!

16:07.551 --> 16:08.844
You keep it closed.

16:09.053 --> 16:11.472
I'll get more
for the barricade.

16:16.226 --> 16:18.562
Wasn't the wrong side.

16:18.771 --> 16:21.649
If the grounder army was
still there when Lexa died,

16:21.857 --> 16:23.567
they would have attacked,
and you know it.

16:23.776 --> 16:25.694
I wanted to see
things like you.

16:25.903 --> 16:27.780
I needed that,
to believe

16:27.988 --> 16:29.365
that they were bad
and we were good.

16:31.283 --> 16:33.243
I don't know what
I believe anymore.

16:33.452 --> 16:35.245
I just know
I have to live

16:35.454 --> 16:38.582
with what I've done.

17:07.528 --> 17:08.570
Uh!

17:15.411 --> 17:17.246
I don't
believe it.

17:17.454 --> 17:18.414
What, did you find
the kill switch?

17:18.622 --> 17:20.165
Don't answer that.
Alie can hear us.

17:20.374 --> 17:22.209
I'm reading
her code, Harper.

17:22.418 --> 17:24.128
Alie already
knows.

17:24.336 --> 17:28.215
Knows what?
What are you talking about?

17:28.424 --> 17:29.758
Clarke is in
the city of light.

17:47.151 --> 17:49.236
Abby, Abby, we've
got a problem.

17:49.445 --> 17:51.238
Hey, hey, come on.

17:51.447 --> 17:54.408
Move.
She's crashing.

18:01.040 --> 18:04.418
Clarke's not getting
enough Nightblood.

18:04.626 --> 18:07.171
Her body is already
rejecting the flame.

18:14.053 --> 18:14.845
You need
to take over.

18:15.054 --> 18:16.972
Do exactly
what I'm doing.

18:17.181 --> 18:18.599
Come on.

18:27.316 --> 18:29.610
If the blood stops flowing
through this tube,

18:29.818 --> 18:33.489
Clarke's brain
will liquefy.

18:33.697 --> 18:36.492
Wait. Clarke
took the chip?

18:36.700 --> 18:39.286
She would've
had to, but--

18:39.495 --> 18:40.746
what?

18:40.954 --> 18:43.040
Alie's running
a flush subroutine to find her,

18:43.248 --> 18:45.709
sending Clarke's code
out to everyone.

18:45.918 --> 18:47.920
- Like she's a virus.
- Exactly.

18:51.673 --> 18:52.549
Uh!

18:52.758 --> 18:54.009
Alie wouldn't
have to do that

18:54.218 --> 18:55.886
if she could
control her.

18:56.095 --> 18:58.138
It's like Clarke is running
a different program.

19:00.224 --> 19:01.725
Uh! Uh!

19:05.896 --> 19:08.440
Did she put the flame
in her head?

19:08.649 --> 19:10.651
You don't
need to whisper.

19:10.859 --> 19:13.153
I'm aware Clarke has merged
with the other a.I.

19:13.362 --> 19:15.155
- Ah!
- Uh!

19:15.364 --> 19:17.199
Thanks to her, my code
is now updating

19:17.407 --> 19:20.410
to version 2
of my program.

19:20.619 --> 19:24.289
What happens
when Alie is updated?

19:25.749 --> 19:27.709
She'll delete
the kill switch.

19:27.918 --> 19:30.295
We won't be
able to stop her.

19:32.381 --> 19:34.716
So find the damn
kill switch.

19:39.513 --> 19:42.307
Uh! Oh! Uh!

19:42.516 --> 19:43.767
Aah!

19:43.976 --> 19:45.018
Yah!

19:47.521 --> 19:49.273
Lexa?

19:53.068 --> 19:54.069
- Ah!
- Uh!

19:54.278 --> 19:55.237
Ah! Yah!

19:55.445 --> 19:56.405
Uh! Uh!

19:56.613 --> 19:58.782
Ugh! Agh!

19:58.991 --> 20:00.909
Aagh!

20:01.118 --> 20:02.161
Aah!

20:02.369 --> 20:04.037
Aah!

20:04.246 --> 20:05.581
Aagh!

20:07.124 --> 20:09.084
Uh!

20:30.731 --> 20:32.941
Oh, my God.

20:47.706 --> 20:50.792
Our fight is not over.

20:51.001 --> 20:52.836
Ah! Uh...

21:09.478 --> 21:12.481
Something's wrong.
I can't.

21:17.402 --> 21:21.782
I never thought
I'd see you again.

21:21.990 --> 21:24.701
I told you my spirit
would choose wisely.

21:31.500 --> 21:33.210
What is it?

21:33.418 --> 21:34.878
Alie knows
you're here.

21:35.087 --> 21:37.339
She's uploading
the flame from your mind.

21:37.547 --> 21:39.007
Your mind is
changing things.

21:39.216 --> 21:41.843
Day turns to night.
It rains.

21:42.052 --> 21:44.096
We have to hurry.

21:44.304 --> 21:46.265
Uh...Agh!

21:46.473 --> 21:48.392
Clarke?

21:48.600 --> 21:49.559
Uh...Uh...Uh...

21:54.189 --> 21:57.150
It's not working.
Open her shirt.

22:01.947 --> 22:03.407
She's still not
getting enough blood.

22:03.615 --> 22:05.117
We have to increase
Ontari's heart rate.

22:05.325 --> 22:07.411
Clarke. Clarke?

22:09.329 --> 22:11.206
I'm not gonna
like this, am I?

22:18.714 --> 22:20.590
Abby, you need
to move faster, OK?

22:20.799 --> 22:23.260
Clarke?
Clarke, come back.

22:24.845 --> 22:25.804
Uh!

22:41.069 --> 22:42.904
Get over here.

22:43.113 --> 22:44.823
I need you
to pump her heart.

22:45.032 --> 22:46.491
What? Are--
are you crazy?

22:46.700 --> 22:47.868
I'm not gonna
pump her heart.

22:48.076 --> 22:49.578
Now!

22:50.912 --> 22:53.749
It's OK.
Right under there.

22:53.957 --> 22:55.917
- Oh, God.
- It's OK. OK.

22:56.126 --> 22:57.961
You're doing
great.

22:58.170 --> 23:00.839
OK. Just go get Clarke.
I got this.

23:02.132 --> 23:04.259
Come on, my baby.

23:04.468 --> 23:07.387
Fight. Fight.

23:07.596 --> 23:09.389
I know you
can do it.

23:10.974 --> 23:13.310
Clarke, come back.
We need you.

23:17.314 --> 23:20.442
She's stabilizing.
Don't stop what you're doing.

23:25.655 --> 23:27.199
OK.

23:28.825 --> 23:29.868
Hey.

23:39.544 --> 23:41.380
Listen to me.

23:41.588 --> 23:43.256
Now the upload
has begun,

23:43.465 --> 23:45.550
Alie's people will
be able to see us.

23:45.759 --> 23:48.095
We need to be
more careful.

23:48.303 --> 23:49.930
Why aren't they
here already?

23:50.138 --> 23:51.515
The flame offers
some protection,

23:51.723 --> 23:53.850
but less and less.

23:54.059 --> 23:55.519
Can you stand?

23:55.727 --> 23:57.979
Yeah.

24:01.274 --> 24:05.821
My father's watch,
it's working.

24:07.155 --> 24:08.615
It's counting down.

24:10.659 --> 24:13.495
We have 10 minutes to
find that kill switch.

24:20.335 --> 24:22.087
Thank you, Becca.

24:25.674 --> 24:26.842
Come on.

24:29.261 --> 24:31.346
Uh!

24:32.889 --> 24:34.057
Mm!

24:34.266 --> 24:35.767
Look out.

24:36.977 --> 24:38.145
Over.

24:38.353 --> 24:39.396
Uh!

24:40.814 --> 24:42.107
Uh! This isn't
gonna hold for long.

24:42.315 --> 24:43.150
How the hell they
even get in here?

24:43.358 --> 24:45.277
Doesn't matter.

24:45.485 --> 24:48.280
This is where we
make our stand.

24:48.488 --> 24:50.532
Sounds like there's
a lot of them.

24:52.576 --> 24:53.827
May be time
to go to guns.

24:54.035 --> 24:56.872
We got something
better than guns--

24:57.080 --> 24:58.290
surprise.

25:05.005 --> 25:06.840
Let's go.

25:07.048 --> 25:08.800
Rrgh!

25:13.680 --> 25:16.016
Wait, Kane.

25:19.186 --> 25:22.981
Wait. I give up.

25:24.357 --> 25:26.568
I'll take the chip.

25:26.776 --> 25:31.740
Good. No one else
has to die ever.

25:31.948 --> 25:34.493
Maybe you can convince
your mentor of that.

25:34.701 --> 25:37.913
- Indra's alive?
- Yes...

25:38.121 --> 25:43.335
On the cross
suffering needlessly.

25:43.543 --> 25:45.003
Now!

25:51.134 --> 25:52.385
Aah!

25:59.976 --> 26:02.229
The charge
is clear.

26:02.437 --> 26:05.148
Hurry up. Let's get
their weapons.

26:14.699 --> 26:18.036
Wait!
We're losing her.

26:23.208 --> 26:27.337
- It's a firewall.
- I don't understand.

26:27.546 --> 26:30.423
You'll never
get to the kill switch.

26:31.550 --> 26:33.051
Hah.

26:47.691 --> 26:50.652
No. It's OK.

26:50.860 --> 26:53.238
Jasper, what
are you doing here?

26:53.446 --> 26:54.573
Trying
to stop you.

26:54.781 --> 26:56.700
You've seen the
city of light now.

26:56.908 --> 26:58.785
It's perfect.

26:58.994 --> 27:02.622
There's peace,
happiness, safety.

27:02.831 --> 27:04.541
Why would you want
to deny that to anyone?

27:04.749 --> 27:07.752
She's torturing people
to get them here, Jasper,

27:07.961 --> 27:10.839
taking their memories,
controlling them.

27:11.047 --> 27:14.676
This isn't even you.
This is Alie.

27:14.884 --> 27:16.177
She's doing
what has to be done.

27:16.386 --> 27:18.346
She took away
our choice.

27:18.555 --> 27:20.599
Human beings
have free will.

27:20.807 --> 27:22.767
We get to decide
how we should live.

27:22.976 --> 27:25.604
Human beings are
the only species

27:25.812 --> 27:28.273
that act against
their own self-interest.

27:28.481 --> 27:30.108
We torture each other.

27:30.317 --> 27:33.028
We fight,
hurt each other,

27:33.236 --> 27:35.405
break each other's
hearts.

27:37.073 --> 27:40.035
None of that
exists here.

27:40.243 --> 27:43.330
Alie is protecting us
from ourselves.

27:43.538 --> 27:45.332
Clarke,
there's still time.

27:45.540 --> 27:47.250
We'll find another
sign. Let's go.

27:47.459 --> 27:49.252
We can't
let you do that.

27:52.797 --> 27:56.718
Clarke,
there's nowhere to run.

27:56.926 --> 28:00.305
It's over. The second a.I.
Can no longer protect you.

28:00.513 --> 28:03.808
If I remove
the flame,

28:04.017 --> 28:05.810
will it stop
the update?

28:06.019 --> 28:08.813
Yes, but no one's ever
done that by choice before.

28:09.022 --> 28:12.192
Regardless, you'll
be one of them.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.361
Alie will get
the flame either way.

28:14.569 --> 28:15.987
Then stop fighting.

28:20.075 --> 28:21.576
Clarke.

28:27.666 --> 28:30.126
Come on, Clarke.
Trust me.

28:33.922 --> 28:35.131
Raven.

28:36.758 --> 28:38.301
Jasper, get
out of the way.

28:38.510 --> 28:39.344
Uh!

28:48.853 --> 28:50.230
We can't
let them follow.

28:50.438 --> 28:52.315
Go. I'll hold
them off.

28:52.524 --> 28:54.401
No, Lexa.

28:54.609 --> 28:56.111
I love you.

28:56.319 --> 28:58.321
I'll always
be with you.

29:11.418 --> 29:14.295
Aah!

29:19.467 --> 29:22.345
She did it.
She's in.

29:24.222 --> 29:26.766
Now it's up
to Clarke.

29:29.269 --> 29:31.938
Airlock sealed.

29:32.147 --> 29:34.232
Commander...

29:35.775 --> 29:37.736
I'm glad you made it.

29:40.864 --> 29:42.866
You're
Becca Pramheda.

29:43.074 --> 29:45.076
Becca's fine.

29:45.285 --> 29:48.538
There isn't much time.
The code is nearly updated.

29:48.747 --> 29:51.499
Did you
give me this?

29:51.708 --> 29:54.586
No. You did.

29:54.794 --> 29:57.338
Alie 2.0 has merged
with your mind,

29:57.547 --> 30:00.383
but your mind
is in control,

30:00.592 --> 30:02.469
and only the mind
that's in control

30:02.677 --> 30:05.680
can operate
the kill switch.

30:07.223 --> 30:09.100
This is it.

30:17.066 --> 30:19.652
If you
pull that...

30:22.697 --> 30:25.533
You will be killing
everyone.

30:25.742 --> 30:28.119
See for yourself.

30:32.248 --> 30:34.083
The nuclear
power plants

30:34.292 --> 30:36.002
that were destroyed
by the bombs

30:36.169 --> 30:37.962
have begun
to melt down.

30:40.465 --> 30:42.217
My drones detected
the first of them

30:42.425 --> 30:44.219
4 months ago.

30:44.427 --> 30:46.095
There are more than
a dozen at-risk plants

30:46.304 --> 30:50.517
around the world,
7 currently burning.

30:50.725 --> 30:55.104
Global radiation levels
are already rising.

30:55.313 --> 30:59.567
By my calculations,
in less than 6 months,

30:59.776 --> 31:04.614
96% of the earth's surface
will be uninhabitable...

31:06.699 --> 31:10.036
Even for those
born in space,

31:10.245 --> 31:12.831
so, you see,
the city of light

31:13.039 --> 31:16.501
is the only thing
that can save you.

31:25.718 --> 31:26.886
This is it.

31:27.095 --> 31:29.138
We need to keep Clarke
safe, give her time.

31:29.347 --> 31:31.057
They're unarmed, but
they won't feel pain,

31:31.224 --> 31:32.851
and they won't stop
until they're out cold.

31:33.059 --> 31:34.602
Copy that.
Go for the knockout.

31:37.105 --> 31:39.065
Only if they
get past you.

31:53.538 --> 31:56.082
Black rain
will come first.

31:56.249 --> 31:59.043
There will be no
drinkable water.

31:59.252 --> 32:01.754
Precancerous lesions
will form on--

32:01.963 --> 32:03.464
she's stalling.

32:03.673 --> 32:04.632
As soon as the update
is complete,

32:04.841 --> 32:06.843
she'll delete
the kill switch.

32:10.388 --> 32:12.599
Here we go.

32:16.811 --> 32:17.687
Uh! Ooh!

32:19.355 --> 32:21.566
I am not stalling.

32:22.984 --> 32:25.153
I'm telling
the truth.

32:25.361 --> 32:26.863
Why tell us now?

32:27.071 --> 32:29.240
If it's true,
why not use this

32:29.449 --> 32:30.617
to get people
to take the chip

32:30.825 --> 32:33.328
instead of
torturing them?

32:33.536 --> 32:35.163
The last time
I warned my creator

32:35.371 --> 32:38.124
of a threat
to human survival,

32:38.333 --> 32:40.793
she chose
to lock me away

32:41.002 --> 32:43.880
and came here to work
on my replacement.

32:44.088 --> 32:47.675
Define "perverse
instantiation."

32:47.884 --> 32:50.637
Perverse instantiation--
the implementation

32:50.845 --> 32:53.932
of a benign final goal
through deleterious methods

32:54.140 --> 32:57.268
unforeseen
by a human programmer.

32:57.477 --> 33:00.688
Like killing
6.5 billion people

33:00.897 --> 33:03.691
to solve
overpopulation.

33:03.900 --> 33:06.194
The goal isn't
everything, Alie.

33:06.402 --> 33:09.072
How you reach the
goal matters, too.

33:09.280 --> 33:13.451
I'm sorry that I didn't
teach you that.

33:21.000 --> 33:24.170
Clarke, come on!
We can't hold them off.

33:24.379 --> 33:26.047
It's now
or never, Clarke.

33:26.255 --> 33:27.465
Once Alie's upgraded,

33:27.674 --> 33:29.092
I won't be able
to help you anymore.

33:29.300 --> 33:32.637
But I will...In
the city of light.

33:32.845 --> 33:34.806
You don't have
to bear the burden

33:35.014 --> 33:37.392
of decisions like
this one, Clarke.

33:41.896 --> 33:44.565
You don't have to live
with the pain

33:44.774 --> 33:47.443
of the things that
you've done anymore,

33:47.652 --> 33:53.741
the lives that you have taken,
and those you've lost.

33:57.453 --> 33:59.956
You will be
at peace.

34:00.164 --> 34:01.708
Ah!

34:01.916 --> 34:02.959
Aah!

34:03.167 --> 34:05.628
You will
live forever.

34:05.837 --> 34:08.756
I've tried running
away from my pain.

34:08.965 --> 34:10.925
It doesn't work.

34:11.134 --> 34:13.761
Your people
don't agree, Clarke.

34:13.970 --> 34:15.847
You heard Jasper.

34:16.055 --> 34:17.974
Even those
who were coerced

34:18.182 --> 34:20.560
would still choose
to stay here.

34:24.939 --> 34:27.191
Ah! Uh!

34:27.400 --> 34:28.317
Aah!

34:28.526 --> 34:29.694
Oh!

34:35.658 --> 34:37.827
Give them
a real choice,

34:38.036 --> 34:39.620
and I won't
pull this lever.

34:39.829 --> 34:41.289
Give them back
their pain,

34:41.497 --> 34:42.790
their
memories.

34:42.999 --> 34:44.709
Let them decide
for themselves.

34:44.917 --> 34:46.794
She can't.

34:47.003 --> 34:49.714
Her core command is
to make life better

34:49.922 --> 34:50.965
for mankind.

34:51.174 --> 34:54.469
She still thinks
she's doing that.

34:58.431 --> 35:00.850
20 seconds, and the kill switch
will be gone.

35:01.059 --> 35:02.810
Would you really
condemn the human race

35:03.019 --> 35:04.896
to die in 6 months?

35:05.104 --> 35:08.107
We'll figure
something out.

35:09.692 --> 35:10.985
We always do.

35:11.194 --> 35:13.154
Yes, Clarke.
There's still hope.

35:13.362 --> 35:14.530
Huh!

35:14.739 --> 35:15.865
Raah!

35:16.074 --> 35:19.077
According to my calculations,
there is not.

35:20.203 --> 35:21.496
Uh!

35:22.622 --> 35:24.457
10 seconds.

35:24.665 --> 35:28.294
Let me ease
their pain, Clarke.

35:28.503 --> 35:31.297
We can save
the human race together.

35:31.464 --> 35:34.175
Huh...Aagh!

35:41.808 --> 35:46.104
You don't ease pain.
You overcome it...

35:48.898 --> 35:50.483
And we will.

36:01.494 --> 36:04.747
Agh...

36:09.919 --> 36:12.672
Agh!

36:12.880 --> 36:17.593
Ohh! Oh...

36:38.447 --> 36:40.950
Clarke.

36:41.159 --> 36:43.161
Heh.

36:43.369 --> 36:45.580
You did it.

36:47.248 --> 36:49.542
Little help here?

36:50.918 --> 36:53.588
We need to remove
the flame.

37:01.846 --> 37:03.264
Oh!

37:03.472 --> 37:06.559
Ohh...Ow.

37:06.767 --> 37:09.061
Ohh...

37:11.230 --> 37:15.151
Ahh...Oh...

37:23.993 --> 37:25.494
Thank you.

37:27.830 --> 37:30.249
Just another day
on the ground, right?

37:31.542 --> 37:33.461
John...

37:35.046 --> 37:36.172
- Oh...
- Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

37:36.380 --> 37:38.049
Oh, I'm sorry,
John.

37:38.257 --> 37:40.593
That's OK.
It's OK.

38:01.405 --> 38:03.407
Go to him.

38:03.616 --> 38:04.951
I'm OK.

38:37.942 --> 38:40.069
How will we know
she did it?

38:40.278 --> 38:42.905
She did it.

38:43.114 --> 38:44.573
Jasper.

38:46.659 --> 38:49.161
Is it
really you?

38:49.370 --> 38:52.039
I was finally happy.

39:03.217 --> 39:05.886
- Jasper...
- Huh?

39:06.095 --> 39:09.515
I know this world
can suck,

39:09.724 --> 39:12.601
but at least
it's real.

39:12.810 --> 39:14.478
We can get through
this together.

39:14.687 --> 39:17.231
You really
believe that?

39:17.440 --> 39:19.859
We will be
happy again,

39:20.026 --> 39:21.777
I promise.

39:23.738 --> 39:25.990
I'm sorry
I stabbed you.

39:26.198 --> 39:28.326
I'm sorry
I shot you.

39:28.534 --> 39:31.203
- I didn't feel it.
- Ha ha ha!

39:31.412 --> 39:33.456
- Oh...Whoa!
- Easy, easy.

39:33.664 --> 39:37.084
- Mm!
- Hold on.

39:43.132 --> 39:45.092
I'm sorry, Monty.

39:45.301 --> 39:48.888
That's OK.

39:51.807 --> 39:54.185
Could use a drink.

39:54.393 --> 39:57.104
Ha ha! Yeah.
We all could.

39:57.313 --> 39:59.648
This round's
on me.

39:59.857 --> 40:00.941
Whoa, whoa.
Let me help you.

40:01.150 --> 40:02.902
Oh, no.
I've got it.

40:10.826 --> 40:12.620
Ahh...

40:17.833 --> 40:20.169
Ahh...

40:43.818 --> 40:46.737
Alie's gone.

40:46.946 --> 40:49.198
Yeah. I figured.

40:53.994 --> 40:55.996
Clarke, you're not
acting like someone

40:56.205 --> 40:58.332
who just
saved the world.

40:58.541 --> 41:01.419
Because we didn't...

41:03.879 --> 41:05.631
Not yet.

41:16.142 --> 41:17.184
Uh!

41:17.393 --> 41:18.436
Uhh...

41:19.645 --> 41:20.646
Huh!

41:24.024 --> 41:25.943
Huh!

41:27.069 --> 41:29.405
Uh...Uhh!
