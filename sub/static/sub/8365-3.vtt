00:01.418 --> 00:03.752
MOIRA: David! Alexis!

00:03.754 --> 00:05.954
Time to leave for breakfast.

00:05.956 --> 00:08.690
Honestly David,
why are you not ready?

00:08.692 --> 00:10.091
- I'm not going.

00:10.093 --> 00:11.526
How is it that a moth
can find its way

00:11.528 --> 00:13.795
into a triple locked
titanium suitcase?!

00:13.797 --> 00:15.730
- The perils of owning cashmere.

00:15.732 --> 00:17.899
Alexis! Please, dear!

00:17.901 --> 00:19.534
- Alexis hasn't been here
for a week and a half.

00:19.536 --> 00:20.935
She's at Mutt's.

00:20.937 --> 00:22.270
- Well, that's simply not true.

00:22.272 --> 00:24.773
I had breakfast with her
just yesterday.

00:24.775 --> 00:26.307
- That was me!

00:26.309 --> 00:29.711
- We had a lengthy conversation
about hosiery and menopause.

00:29.713 --> 00:31.546
- Again, that was me.

00:33.116 --> 00:37.285
♪ ♪

00:38.722 --> 00:40.722
(Birds chirp)

00:40.724 --> 00:43.691
CUSTOMER: Hello? Anyone here?

00:43.693 --> 00:45.193
Oh, hey.

00:45.195 --> 00:47.829
Can I get you to take
a quick look at my muffler?

00:47.831 --> 00:50.198
- Oh, I'm- I'm sorry,
I don't work here.

00:50.200 --> 00:52.867
- Oh... that's-
'cause you're behind the desk,

00:52.869 --> 00:54.302
and everything.

00:54.304 --> 00:56.104
- Oh yeah, no, I mean
I "work" here,

00:56.106 --> 01:01.009
but I don't actually work
"here..." in the garage.

01:01.011 --> 01:03.745
I mean, I am working
here in the garage,

01:03.747 --> 01:07.081
but I don't work
for the garage. I'm...

01:07.083 --> 01:09.684
- So you don't know anything
about mufflers?

01:09.686 --> 01:11.920
'Cause I think it's just a
loose connection on the bottom.

01:11.922 --> 01:14.689
- Yeah, Bob will be back
in a minute,

01:14.691 --> 01:16.057
and I think that's
your best bet,

01:16.059 --> 01:19.093
just you know, 'cause he comes
and goes, and...

01:20.931 --> 01:25.266
- Okay, well, maybe I'll
just go to another garage.

01:25.268 --> 01:29.504
- Yeah, yeah. Well, sorry,
I uh, couldn't help.

01:34.678 --> 01:36.144
- (Laughs)

01:36.146 --> 01:38.913
Hey Johnny, I just went out
and got me a muffin.

01:38.915 --> 01:41.516
- Bob, a customer was just
in here,

01:41.518 --> 01:44.252
and he was saying he had
a problem with a muffler.

01:44.254 --> 01:46.921
- Oh yeah? What uh,
what'd it end up being?

01:46.923 --> 01:49.224
- Well, I don't know,
I didn't go out and look!

01:49.226 --> 01:51.559
- Oh?
- I'm not a mechanic!

01:51.561 --> 01:53.928
- Well, I don't expect you
to know everything,

01:53.930 --> 01:55.864
but you know, if a client
of yours came in here,

01:55.866 --> 01:57.732
I'd certainly talk to them.

01:57.734 --> 02:00.101
- Well, I hope you wouldn't.

02:00.103 --> 02:01.803
- Well, not that I have
to worry,

02:01.805 --> 02:04.072
I know you're a little
low on clients.

02:04.074 --> 02:07.809
- That's because I'm building
a business, Bob.

02:07.811 --> 02:09.844
And right now
I'm in strategy mode,

02:09.846 --> 02:11.512
looking for opportunities,

02:11.514 --> 02:14.682
and eventually I will
implement a plan.

02:14.684 --> 02:16.117
- Well, if you feel like uh,

02:16.119 --> 02:18.653
you might like to implement
a muffler, be my guest.

02:18.655 --> 02:21.623
Because I can't afford to lose
any customers right now, Johnny,

02:21.625 --> 02:26.160
especially ah, when I'm giving
away free office space.

02:34.771 --> 02:36.271
(Birds chirp)

02:37.874 --> 02:39.307
- Question.

02:39.309 --> 02:42.210
The cedar planks
out behind the motel,

02:42.212 --> 02:44.012
are they being used
for something,

02:44.014 --> 02:45.847
or are they up for grabs?

02:45.849 --> 02:47.782
- How do you know it's cedar?

02:47.784 --> 02:49.817
- Um, I bought a cologne once,
in Japan,

02:49.819 --> 02:51.119
that's supposed to smell
like the aftermath

02:51.121 --> 02:52.987
of a car crashing
into a cedar tree.

02:52.989 --> 02:55.390
- Why would anyone
wanna smell like that?

02:55.392 --> 02:56.925
- Hmm?
- You know what?

02:56.927 --> 02:59.928
Never mind, the cedar is yours.

02:59.930 --> 03:01.362
- Thank you so much.

03:01.364 --> 03:03.197
- Um, If I may,

03:03.199 --> 03:06.901
what are you planning on doing
with a pile of wood?

03:06.903 --> 03:09.103
- Oh. Um...

03:09.105 --> 03:11.506
A family of moths
seem to have mistaken

03:11.508 --> 03:13.341
my cashmere sweaters
for an Atlantic City

03:13.343 --> 03:15.009
all-you-can-eat buffet.

03:15.011 --> 03:16.844
And I plan on putting
a stop to that.

03:16.846 --> 03:20.181
So I'm building a cedar chest
for my knits.

03:20.183 --> 03:22.750
- You're planning on building
a cedar chest?

03:22.752 --> 03:24.585
- That's correct.

03:24.587 --> 03:26.921
- You are.

03:26.923 --> 03:29.190
You're gonna build it?
- It's a box!

03:29.192 --> 03:31.225
So you're just nailing some
planks of wood together.

03:31.227 --> 03:33.094
Anyway, if you've seen
the state of my sweaters,

03:33.096 --> 03:35.997
you'd know that I have very
little choice in the matter.

03:35.999 --> 03:37.932
So thank you.
- Okay well, don't let me

03:37.934 --> 03:39.701
stand in the way
of your handiwork!

03:39.703 --> 03:42.537
- Mhmm.
- May the force be with you.

03:42.539 --> 03:43.972
- Thank you so much.

03:43.974 --> 03:45.940
Thank you, genuinely.

03:45.942 --> 03:47.742
Honestly, you're so great.

03:47.744 --> 03:49.210
(Door slams)

03:51.948 --> 03:54.582
(Women laugh loudly)

03:54.584 --> 03:56.651
- Oh, Twyla--

03:56.653 --> 03:59.087
(Women laugh and chatter)

04:00.557 --> 04:02.757
- Twyla!

04:02.759 --> 04:05.026
(Shouts) Twyla!

04:05.028 --> 04:06.761
- Uh, be right there,
Mrs. Rose.

04:06.763 --> 04:08.730
- Hi, Moira!
- Hello, everyone.

04:08.732 --> 04:10.231
- Hey.

04:10.233 --> 04:12.500
- I'll see you guys later.
- Yeah, see you at two.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.135
- Yeah.

04:14.137 --> 04:16.037
Sorry about that, I wan't sure
whether you were waiting

04:16.039 --> 04:18.206
for your family, or a friend...

04:18.208 --> 04:20.875
- No, just an intimate
breakfast, nothing special,

04:20.877 --> 04:23.277
no big "ladies' bruncheon"
for me.

04:23.279 --> 04:25.246
- Ladies' bruncheon?

04:25.248 --> 04:28.149
- Well, whatever that was.
A gathering of the girls, I...

04:28.151 --> 04:30.451
- Oh, you mean the Jazzagals.
- I do?

04:30.453 --> 04:32.687
- Yeah, the Jazzagals
is our singing group.

04:32.689 --> 04:35.056
- A singing group?
What fun.

04:35.058 --> 04:36.924
- Yeah, Jocelyn started it
a few years ago,

04:36.926 --> 04:38.693
and it's been great.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.161
We even went to New York once.

04:40.163 --> 04:42.964
- Oh, a trip to the big city.
How grand!

04:42.966 --> 04:45.767
Let me guess, a bucket
of shrimp in Times Square,

04:45.769 --> 04:47.969
followed by a "Lion King"
matinee!

04:47.971 --> 04:51.005
- No, actually, we performed
in Central Park.

04:51.007 --> 04:53.107
- C-Central Park? Really?

04:53.109 --> 04:56.878
- Yeah! For the "Little Towns,
Big Voices" Festival.

04:56.880 --> 04:59.981
- You do realize I am
a professional vocalist.

04:59.983 --> 05:01.416
- Oh, really?

05:01.418 --> 05:03.117
I thought you were in like,
a soap opera.

05:03.119 --> 05:05.620
- Oh, I didn't know you were
a fan, thank you!

05:05.622 --> 05:08.022
My roots are in the theatre.

05:08.024 --> 05:10.858
Especially musicals.
Anything "Andy" Webber!

05:10.860 --> 05:13.194
- Wow! So did you record
an album?

05:13.196 --> 05:15.997
- Oh, yes, you'll find me
on ensemble tracks

05:15.999 --> 05:20.902
seven, nine, and thirteen of the
original cast recording of Starlight...

05:20.904 --> 05:23.171
"Starlight Express."

05:23.173 --> 05:25.406
- Well, then you should
definitely talk to Jocelyn!

05:25.408 --> 05:27.408
She would love to have you
in the group.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.812
- Or perhaps Jocelyn
should speak to me.

05:30.814 --> 05:33.047
- Yeah. Menu?

05:33.049 --> 05:36.117
- Yes please, I'm still
not quite off book.

05:40.023 --> 05:42.256
- Aaah!

05:42.258 --> 05:43.558
(Knocking) Uh huh?

05:45.095 --> 05:47.128
- Uh, hey, I just came by
for Alexis,

05:47.130 --> 05:49.464
she wanted me to grab
some uh...

05:49.466 --> 05:51.099
- Cute looks for...
- Cute looks for the barn?

05:51.101 --> 05:54.001
- Yeah.
- Yeah, in the closet.

05:54.003 --> 05:55.603
- Everything okay?

05:55.605 --> 05:57.271
- Yeah, I'm just um...

05:57.273 --> 05:59.507
I'm just doing some measurements
I'm measuring something, so.

05:59.509 --> 06:01.175
- Why don't you use
a measuring tape?

06:01.177 --> 06:03.010
- Ah, because we don't have one.

06:03.012 --> 06:05.546
- Did you ask Stevie if maybe
the motel has one?

06:05.548 --> 06:07.915
- Um... yeah, I haven't got--

06:07.917 --> 06:10.017
I hadn't thought of--
I didn't think of that.

06:10.019 --> 06:12.620
- So what are you measuring,
exactly?

06:12.622 --> 06:14.922
- It's a really tragic story,

06:14.924 --> 06:17.558
involving some damaged
luxury cashmere.

06:17.560 --> 06:21.996
And so I am building a cedar
chest for my sweaters.

06:21.998 --> 06:26.267
So I'm just measuring how big
to make the chest.

06:26.269 --> 06:27.969
- Well, I've built a chest before.
- Yeah?

06:27.971 --> 06:29.604
- And I have some time, um...

06:29.606 --> 06:32.974
Do you want some help?

06:32.976 --> 06:34.642
- You know what?
That could be good.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.043
- Well, how far along are you?

06:36.045 --> 06:38.880
- Um, I'm this far.

06:43.786 --> 06:45.253
(Door clicks)

06:45.255 --> 06:48.923
- I can't come in,
But I do have some good news.

06:50.293 --> 06:53.294
- That's great.

06:53.296 --> 06:54.929
What's your news?

06:54.931 --> 06:56.764
- Well, a little bird
chirped in my ear

06:56.766 --> 06:58.633
about your singing group.

06:58.635 --> 07:00.668
- Oh, you mean the Jazzagals.

07:00.670 --> 07:03.004
- Yes, at first I wondered aloud

07:03.006 --> 07:05.740
why would a competitive
vocal group

07:05.742 --> 07:08.543
not reach out to a trained
chanteuse?

07:08.545 --> 07:09.977
- Oh, we're just a group
of gals.

07:09.979 --> 07:12.847
- Exactly, that's the answer.

07:12.849 --> 07:16.017
Small minds don't reach
for the stars.

07:16.019 --> 07:17.985
No more! Not on my watch.

07:17.987 --> 07:20.988
Jocelyn, I am here!

07:20.990 --> 07:24.192
- You wanna audition
for the Jazzagals?

07:24.194 --> 07:26.861
- Au-Audition!

07:26.863 --> 07:29.697
Uh, though I'm sure
you mean no offense,

07:29.699 --> 07:31.632
in the actual world
of entertainment,

07:31.634 --> 07:35.102
I'm what's known as,
"offer only."

07:35.104 --> 07:37.572
- Moira, I know you're
a great singer,

07:37.574 --> 07:39.640
everybody has to audition,

07:39.642 --> 07:41.709
and I can't have you
not audition,

07:41.711 --> 07:43.211
it would open up a whole
can of worms,

07:43.213 --> 07:46.247
I mean, even Gwen
had to audition,

07:46.249 --> 07:49.917
and she was in a regional
production of "Annie."

07:49.919 --> 07:53.087
- Who hasn't been?

07:53.089 --> 07:55.856
- Listen, we would love
to have you,

07:55.858 --> 07:58.893
you think about it.

07:58.895 --> 08:00.428
- Okay...

08:00.430 --> 08:02.196
(Car rumbles)

08:04.801 --> 08:06.968
(Horn honks)

08:09.606 --> 08:12.473
- Bob? You've got a customer!

08:17.847 --> 08:20.881
(Horn honks) Bob!

08:23.953 --> 08:28.222
Yeah, the owner's just stepped
out, uh, but maybe...

08:30.193 --> 08:31.459
I can help you?

08:32.829 --> 08:34.295
(Birds chirp)

08:38.268 --> 08:40.067
- Hey.

08:40.069 --> 08:43.504
- Has Paul Bunion finished
his box?

08:43.506 --> 08:45.239
- Who?

08:47.076 --> 08:50.911
I'm going to need some things
for the chest.

08:50.913 --> 08:53.781
- Like the number
for a carpenter?

08:53.783 --> 08:55.049
- Like, a work bench,
a miter saw,

08:55.051 --> 08:57.118
two bar clamps,
and some dowels.

08:57.120 --> 09:01.589
- Okay... do you know how
to use a miter saw?

09:01.591 --> 09:03.391
- Um, no. Mutt is out back,

09:03.393 --> 09:07.128
and he's asked me to get
these things for him.

09:07.130 --> 09:11.732
Um, we're building
the chest together. So...

09:11.734 --> 09:16.671
- Wow, this whole thing
just got a lot weirder.

09:16.673 --> 09:21.042
There's a tool shed out back,
the other side of the motel.

09:21.044 --> 09:24.545
- Okay.
- Will you be requiring a tool box?

09:26.115 --> 09:27.915
- Maybe?

09:27.917 --> 09:31.118
Um, let's go with yes,
just to be safe.

09:31.120 --> 09:33.087
- Will you be needing
your basic toolbox,

09:33.089 --> 09:37.024
or your "cedar chest" tool box?

09:37.026 --> 09:40.027
- Obviously the cedar chest
tool box!

09:40.029 --> 09:41.862
- (Laughs)
Oh, that's in the shed.

09:41.864 --> 09:44.131
It's a big wooden box,

09:44.133 --> 09:47.034
with the words,
"tools to make a cedar chest"

09:47.036 --> 09:49.136
carved into the side of it,
so it's really clear--

09:49.138 --> 09:52.173
- Okay, I'm assuming
you're kidding.

09:52.175 --> 09:53.941
Um...

09:53.943 --> 09:55.876
But in the off chance
that you're not,

09:55.878 --> 09:58.579
where in the shed
would I find that box?

09:58.581 --> 10:00.314
- (mouths) Wow.

10:00.316 --> 10:04.251
- You're kidding.

10:04.253 --> 10:05.553

- Hello, you.

10:38.488 --> 10:40.755
JAZZAGALS: Hi!
MOIRA: Sorry for interrupting.

10:40.757 --> 10:42.623
I just-I just thought
I'd stop by,

10:42.625 --> 10:43.958
I was in the neighbourhood.

10:43.960 --> 10:45.459
Maybe I should showcase
my talents,

10:45.461 --> 10:46.761
I thought, for the group.

10:46.763 --> 10:48.929
- Oh, that's great.

10:48.931 --> 10:51.098
- Great, you can call it
an audition if you must,

10:51.100 --> 10:53.601
or an impromptu performance,

10:53.603 --> 10:55.770
or perhaps "an evening with..."

10:55.772 --> 10:58.105
- That all sounds amazing.

10:58.107 --> 11:00.674
We're just finishing up
a rehearsal,

11:00.676 --> 11:03.711
we just have to work out a couple
of rough spots in Lena's solo,

11:03.713 --> 11:05.946
and then you can have the floor.

11:05.948 --> 11:07.815
- I'll wait, far be it for me
to get in the way

11:07.817 --> 11:10.251
of you making any necessary
improvements.

11:11.988 --> 11:14.188
- Okay, so we're almost there,

11:14.190 --> 11:16.223
let's just work out some
of those little rough spots.

11:16.225 --> 11:17.925
Okay?
- Okay.

11:17.927 --> 11:20.094
- So let's take it from...

11:20.096 --> 11:21.595
"For tonight,
for the first time."

BOB: Hey, Johnny. Keepin' busy,
or uh... hardly workin'?

11:42.251 --> 11:45.219
- Well, first of all Bob,
that's not the expression.

11:45.221 --> 11:47.121
Um, take a seat.

11:51.427 --> 11:53.294
If I may, an observation?

11:55.231 --> 11:57.765
To run a business,
you have to be here

11:57.767 --> 12:00.067
to run the business.

12:00.069 --> 12:03.804
You have to be here to deal
with your clients.

12:03.806 --> 12:06.974
That's what I've been
doing all afternoon.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.943
- You got some clients,
that's great news!

12:08.945 --> 12:12.246
- No, I was dealing
with your customers!

12:14.016 --> 12:15.850
- Well, thank you, Johnny,

12:15.852 --> 12:18.085
that's a refreshing change
of attitude.

12:18.087 --> 12:20.287
- Bob, you're never here!

12:20.289 --> 12:22.122
And while you were gone,

12:22.124 --> 12:24.625
I helped a customer fill
his tire with air,

12:24.627 --> 12:28.128
I helped an elderly woman
add oil to her car,

12:28.130 --> 12:31.832
and I sold the '93 Buick
for $350 dollars.

12:31.834 --> 12:34.201
You've got to be here
to run your business!

12:34.203 --> 12:36.904
- Whoa, you have been busy!

12:36.906 --> 12:38.506
Listen, uh...

12:38.508 --> 12:42.910
tell me just a little more
about selling that Buick.

12:44.714 --> 12:46.580
- Well, it's a funny story.

12:46.582 --> 12:49.183
This guy came in supposedly
for directions.

12:49.185 --> 12:51.185
Okay, but anyone with
a background in sales

12:51.187 --> 12:53.721
could see how he was
eyeballing that Buick.

12:53.723 --> 12:55.155
So I slow play it.

12:55.157 --> 12:57.791
I pretend I don't notice.

12:57.793 --> 13:00.261
And then he sort of mentions
the Buick.

13:00.263 --> 13:03.163
So I hem and haw, textbook
stuff, I tell him, you know,

13:03.165 --> 13:06.233
oh, there's a lot of interest
in that particular vehicle.

13:06.235 --> 13:08.836
You know, I'm playing the guy
like a bow fiddle.

13:08.838 --> 13:11.639
Then he finally admits
this is the kind of car

13:11.641 --> 13:13.340
that he's been looking for.

13:13.342 --> 13:14.909
Oh, really? Says I.

13:14.911 --> 13:17.411
That's when I go in
for the kill.

13:17.413 --> 13:20.581
Long story short, he forks over
$350 dollars cash.

13:22.285 --> 13:24.919
And you're welcome.

13:24.921 --> 13:27.922
Certain instincts
you just don't lose.

13:27.924 --> 13:29.823
It's like riding a bike.

13:29.825 --> 13:33.227
- Well, funny you should
use that expression.

13:33.229 --> 13:36.697
Because Dick Sinson is gonna be
riding his bike

13:36.699 --> 13:40.501
until we can get his car
back for him!

13:40.503 --> 13:42.970
- Who's Dick Simpson?
- I couldn't tell 'ya.

13:42.972 --> 13:46.640
But Dick Sinson is the fella
whose car you just sold.

13:46.642 --> 13:48.442
He brought it in
for a brake job.

13:48.444 --> 13:50.644
I don't recall him
wanting to sell it.

13:50.646 --> 13:52.179
- Oh.

13:52.181 --> 13:53.747
- Oh, poor Dick.

13:53.749 --> 13:55.115
He loved that car.

13:55.117 --> 13:57.985
It was a gift from the church.

13:57.987 --> 14:00.854
He and his family hit
on some hard times, and uh...

14:00.856 --> 14:03.223
- Yeah, you know what, Bob?

14:03.225 --> 14:05.960
I'll tell 'ya, I will call
Mr. Stinson, and apologize.

14:05.962 --> 14:08.729
- Well, you can apologize
to Mr. Stinson

14:08.731 --> 14:10.564
until the cows come home,

14:10.566 --> 14:14.868
but I don't see how that
is gonna help Dick Sinson!

14:14.870 --> 14:16.770
- I'll fix it, Bob!

14:16.772 --> 14:19.139
- Here's hopin'.

14:23.512 --> 14:24.845
- Ridiculous name!

14:24.847 --> 14:26.513
- Sin-Sinson... Sinson!

14:27.917 --> 14:29.516
Dick Sin-Sinson!

14:29.518 --> 14:31.151
(Rasps)

14:33.990 --> 14:36.624
MUTT: Ahh... we just need
to wait for the glue to dry,

14:36.626 --> 14:39.326
it shouldn't take too long.
- This is really nice of you.

14:39.328 --> 14:41.195
Thank you very much.

14:41.197 --> 14:43.163
- Yeah, well, I can't not
jump in and help

14:43.165 --> 14:46.033
when I see someone doin'
something wrong.

14:46.035 --> 14:49.336
- Was it wrong, or was it
just unconventional?

14:49.338 --> 14:51.071
- No, it was wrong.

14:51.073 --> 14:53.407
- Okay, well,
I'm not gonna argue with you,

14:53.409 --> 14:54.608
'cause I need you to keep
working, we're in too deep.

14:54.610 --> 14:57.745
Uh, does Alexis know about this?

14:57.747 --> 15:00.280
- Yeah... definitely.

15:05.621 --> 15:07.888
Can I tell you something?

15:07.890 --> 15:10.457
But you gotta promise
not to tell Alexis.

15:12.194 --> 15:14.161
- Okay, um...

15:15.731 --> 15:17.031
If you're experiencing
feelings for me,

15:17.033 --> 15:18.932
like, I totally get it.

15:18.934 --> 15:20.300
And normally I'd be into it,

15:20.302 --> 15:22.002
I've just been down
this road before,

15:22.004 --> 15:23.804
and it's-it's messy.

15:23.806 --> 15:26.874
- No, it's about Alexis.
- I see, okay.

15:26.876 --> 15:29.510
Um, well, you know, uh...

15:29.512 --> 15:32.179
what is it?

15:32.181 --> 15:33.881
- She slept over like
a week and a half ago,

15:33.883 --> 15:35.282
and she hasn't left.

15:35.284 --> 15:37.685
- Uh huh.
- I mean, don't get me wrong,

15:37.687 --> 15:39.053
I love having her there
at night,

15:39.055 --> 15:41.622
if you know what I mean.
- Yeah, I do, yeah.

15:41.624 --> 15:44.291
- It's just the days,
they've gotten a bit um...

15:44.293 --> 15:47.261
- Suffocating?

15:47.263 --> 15:49.963
- I just think that a little
space is a healthy thing.

15:49.965 --> 15:52.232
- Mhmm, it is, totally.

15:52.234 --> 15:54.668
I mean, I've been enjoying it
a lot, so.

15:54.670 --> 15:57.037
- And I live alone, and now
someone is there all the time.

15:57.039 --> 15:59.006
Which is great.
- Uh huh.

15:59.008 --> 16:00.974
- But just not every day.

16:00.976 --> 16:04.078
And I just...
don't know what to say.

16:05.681 --> 16:07.915
- Well, she sort of fades into
the background after a while,

16:07.917 --> 16:10.551
you know, like a smoke alarm.

16:10.553 --> 16:12.586
- Are you just saying that
because you don't want her

16:12.588 --> 16:14.688
to move back here?
- Yes, I am!

16:14.690 --> 16:16.156
You just take some time,
you know?

16:16.158 --> 16:19.793
Carve out some time in a day
to just escape.

16:19.795 --> 16:21.195
You know, do what you wanna do.

16:21.197 --> 16:22.996
It's the only thing
that'll keep you sane.

16:22.998 --> 16:24.965
Because no, you can't mention
any of this to her,

16:24.967 --> 16:27.201
she'd lose her fucking mind.

18:38.634 --> 18:40.133

18:40.135 --> 18:42.002

here tonight.

18:42.004 --> 18:45.172
- Oh, is everything okay?

18:45.174 --> 18:46.773
- Yeah, why wouldn't it be?

18:46.775 --> 18:49.676
- Well, it's just that you've been
spending a lot of time at Mutt's.

18:49.678 --> 18:51.111
- Yeah, I know,

18:51.113 --> 18:53.714
and I actually had to talk
to him about that.

18:53.716 --> 18:56.516
- Oh, you did?

18:56.518 --> 18:57.951
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

18:57.953 --> 18:59.586
- Um, like, he brought
all my stuff back,

18:59.588 --> 19:00.988
and I was like, this is great,

19:00.990 --> 19:03.657
but then at the same time
I was just kinda like,

19:03.659 --> 19:05.893
I feel like I need
my space right now.

19:05.895 --> 19:09.162
- Yeah, and that's something
that you said to him.

19:09.164 --> 19:10.931
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
we were chatting,

19:10.933 --> 19:12.766
and I was just like, I feel
like I need to spend a few days

19:12.768 --> 19:15.836
back at the motel.
- Yeah...

19:15.838 --> 19:18.105
That's-again, that's--
you said that?

19:18.107 --> 19:19.940
- Yeah, that's what
we were talking about.

19:19.942 --> 19:22.042
- Oh, okay. Um...

19:22.044 --> 19:24.211
and how did he take that?

19:24.213 --> 19:27.748
- Um, well, I mean, I was kinda
worried about telling him.

19:27.750 --> 19:29.216
- I'm sure. Uh huh.

19:29.218 --> 19:31.551
- Because I didn't want...
I didn't wanna hurt him,

19:31.553 --> 19:32.953
and I didn't want him to worry,

19:32.955 --> 19:35.022
like, oh my God,
is he breaking up with me?

19:35.024 --> 19:36.890
Is she breaking up with me?

19:36.892 --> 19:38.525
- Right, yeah,
'cause we wouldn't want him...

19:38.527 --> 19:40.327
to worry about that.

19:40.329 --> 19:42.829
- Yeah, exactly.
- Mhmm.

19:42.831 --> 19:45.032
- So... but I'm really glad
that I told him,

19:45.034 --> 19:47.668
and he took it really,
really well.

19:47.670 --> 19:49.503
So...
- That's excellent.

19:49.505 --> 19:52.039
- Yep.

19:52.041 --> 19:53.807
That's a cute little
wood thing, David.

19:53.809 --> 19:56.043
- Thank you, I made it.

20:01.817 --> 20:03.583
- It did seem like a few of them

20:03.585 --> 20:05.252
might've had some training,

20:05.254 --> 20:08.722
but what I bring is a certain
sophistication,

20:08.724 --> 20:11.058
improvisation, showmanship!

20:11.060 --> 20:12.659
- I'm sure you wowed them,
honey.

20:12.661 --> 20:16.063
- Oh John, there were definitely
lots of surprised looks.

20:16.065 --> 20:18.598
- Well, they've probably
never heard the real deal.

20:18.600 --> 20:19.933
- I suppose!

20:19.935 --> 20:22.102
Oh John, it felt so good

20:22.104 --> 20:24.972
to be working the old
muscles again!

20:24.974 --> 20:27.975
Riding the melody,
bending the notes!

20:27.977 --> 20:29.643
- Well, they must've enjoyed it
sweetheart,

20:29.645 --> 20:31.211
if they asked you to join.

20:31.213 --> 20:32.679
- Mm! I know!

20:32.681 --> 20:34.781
I only wish you could've
been there, John.

20:34.783 --> 20:37.117
It would've been so nice
to have you to sing to.

20:37.119 --> 20:40.120
- Well, I'm sorry I missed it.

20:44.760 --> 20:46.927
(Sighs)

20:49.765 --> 20:51.698
(Moira sighs happily)
