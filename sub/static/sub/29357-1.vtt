WEBVTT

01:35.840 --> 01:38.639
<i>To all whom it may concern,</i>

01:39.600 --> 01:43.435
<i>be it known that I,
Thomas Alva Edison,</i>

01:44.200 --> 01:48.513
<i>submits on this,
the 27th day of January, 1880,</i>

01:49.320 --> 01:51.391
<i>the application
of this abstract</i>

01:51.480 --> 01:54.552
<i>to the Patent Office
of the United States of America.</i>

01:57.720 --> 01:59.359
<i>The unique design
of my invention</i>

01:59.440 --> 02:01.318
<i>is that of a glass vacuum tube</i>

02:01.400 --> 02:04.120
<i>which houses inside
a thin cotton thread filament,</i>

02:04.200 --> 02:07.796
<i>the two lower ends of which
secure respective posts,</i>

02:07.880 --> 02:09.678
<i>forming an arch shape.</i>

02:11.400 --> 02:14.120
<i>Details and schematic
drawings follow,</i>

02:14.200 --> 02:16.635
<i>exhibiting all aspects
of the invention.</i>

02:17.480 --> 02:19.437
<i>But its purpose is simple,</i>

02:20.760 --> 02:22.399
<i>to give light.</i>

03:14.680 --> 03:15.750
Boys!

03:27.600 --> 03:29.398
I hope you brought
your checkbooks.

03:38.960 --> 03:41.520
- Are you excited to meet the President?
- Yes.

03:41.600 --> 03:43.512
Don't say a thing
about J.P. Morgan's nose.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.599
- What's wrong with his nose?
- Nothing.

03:46.680 --> 03:48.239
It's huge. Huge!

03:48.320 --> 03:51.199
It's like someone took a hammer
and slammed it into his face.

03:51.280 --> 03:53.033
I thought you already
got the money.

03:53.120 --> 03:54.554
I only got half.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.136
Does Morgan even know
that you're coming?

03:56.160 --> 03:58.152
He'll invest as always.
I hate this.

03:58.240 --> 03:59.536
Mr. Edison,
you have dinner with...

03:59.560 --> 04:01.560
- What?
- Dinner with Westinghouse, on your return.

04:01.720 --> 04:04.792
- Why are barns red?
- Maybe so you can see them in the snow.

04:04.880 --> 04:06.776
No, it's 'cause
red paint's the cheapest.

04:06.800 --> 04:09.235
Morgan will want to know
the practicality of your system.

04:09.320 --> 04:10.640
I have money.

04:10.720 --> 04:12.791
Enough for two small buildings
in Manhattan?

04:12.880 --> 04:14.712
- Yes.
- Oh, good.

04:28.360 --> 04:30.511
This was intended
to be my lunch.

04:30.600 --> 04:33.016
The President had asked
to see the phonograph in person.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.759
I had no idea
you'd be here.

04:34.840 --> 04:36.752
- Mrs. Edison.
- Mr. Morgan.

04:36.880 --> 04:38.960
- These are our children.
- Dot and Dash. Delightful.

04:39.040 --> 04:41.157
I know what you're doing.
How much are you short?

04:41.240 --> 04:43.357
Just how much of my money
do you want to wash away?

04:43.440 --> 04:45.352
Oh, as very,
very much as possible.

04:45.840 --> 04:47.832
- Who's this?
- Samuel Insull.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.593
Mr. Edison's
personal secretary.

04:50.560 --> 04:51.960
Mr. Morgan, Mr. Edison.

04:52.040 --> 04:53.952
Which one?
He's also Mr. Edison.

04:54.040 --> 04:55.633
The President
will see you now.

05:02.200 --> 05:04.874
- Now.
- "On the top of the Crumpetty Tree

05:04.960 --> 05:06.713
"The Quangle Wangle sat,

05:06.800 --> 05:08.837
"But his face
you could not see,

05:08.920 --> 05:10.400
"On account
of his Beaver Hat."

05:11.160 --> 05:12.992
This is the sound
of your voice.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.236
<i>"On the top
of the Crumpetty Tree</i>

05:17.320 --> 05:18.913
<i>"The Quangle Wangle sat,</i>

05:19.000 --> 05:20.354
<i>"But his face
you could not see,</i>

05:20.480 --> 05:22.920
<i>- "On account of his Beaver Hat."</i>
- Is that what I sound like?

05:25.120 --> 05:26.952
My men tell me you're
turning down $5 million.

05:27.040 --> 05:28.793
I'm grateful for the offer,
Mr. President,

05:28.880 --> 05:32.635
but it's the type of science
you're after that I find objectionable.

05:32.720 --> 05:33.776
There's always money
in guns.

05:33.800 --> 05:35.120
The one device
I shall never build

05:35.200 --> 05:38.398
is that which takes the life
of another man. It's barbaric.

05:39.680 --> 05:42.400
But, take a look at this.

05:42.480 --> 05:45.757
One square mile of Manhattan,
the First District.

05:45.840 --> 05:48.071
- And I'm gonna light it up.
- Then you have done it.

05:48.200 --> 05:50.476
A star in a jar.
It's a warm glow.

05:50.560 --> 05:52.279
No smell, no poison.

05:52.360 --> 05:53.874
Thirteen hours
of light per globe,

05:53.960 --> 05:55.758
and it's cheaper than gas.
Safer, too.

05:55.840 --> 05:57.797
We bury the wires
using my DC current,

05:57.880 --> 06:01.237
and those same wires will
bring you energy and heat.

06:02.400 --> 06:05.359
I need two buildings to house
six dynamos of my own construction.

06:05.440 --> 06:07.352
This won't even
reach my house.

06:07.440 --> 06:09.875
Morgan, let me
make you so rich

06:09.960 --> 06:11.997
that you will look back
at this moment and wonder,

06:12.080 --> 06:14.356
"Why was I ever
so disgustingly poor?"

06:17.080 --> 06:18.776
It's all right there.
Ferry to Wall Street.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.776
In case you missed my scribble,
there's a big old circle

06:20.800 --> 06:22.996
around <i>The New York Times.</i>
Free advertising.

06:23.080 --> 06:25.276
- 150.
- Half a million.

06:25.360 --> 06:27.556
I'm talking
about $500,000,

06:27.640 --> 06:30.474
you can buy the next century,
brighter, safer, yours.

06:30.560 --> 06:33.296
Sounds rather grand to me,
Pierpont. If I had your fortune...

06:33.320 --> 06:35.160
With respect,
you don't, Mr. President.

06:39.520 --> 06:41.512
- What is that?
- That's not very nice.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.831
Morse code.

06:43.920 --> 06:45.274
What did the boy say?

06:45.360 --> 06:47.317
- What did the boy say?
- If nothing else,

06:47.440 --> 06:49.880
- it's been a pleasure, Mr. President.
- What did the boy say?

06:51.920 --> 06:53.354
Do you know
what you're doing?

06:54.480 --> 06:56.631
I always receive more
by saying no.

06:58.640 --> 07:01.280
Set up the Manhattan offices
and make them look professional.

07:01.360 --> 07:03.795
- What does that mean?
- I don't know. Carpets...

07:05.160 --> 07:07.595
I don't know, carpets.
I don't know.

07:07.680 --> 07:09.000
And the name?

07:10.560 --> 07:12.153
Edison Electric, of course.

07:12.240 --> 07:14.357
Sir, why not
build munitions?

07:14.440 --> 07:16.272
$5 million,
it's hard to say no to.

07:16.360 --> 07:19.239
No. If it's Edison,
it works.

07:19.320 --> 07:22.392
If it works, I'd strongly prefer
it not kill anybody.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.036
Right.

08:00.760 --> 08:03.514
"Thomas Edison has
an unfavorable opinion

08:03.600 --> 08:05.432
"of college graduates
seeking employment,

08:05.520 --> 08:08.399
"because they cannot answer
his examination questions.

08:09.160 --> 08:12.358
<i>- "Who composed</i> Il trovatore?"
<i>- Verdi.</i>

08:12.440 --> 08:15.319
<i>- "What is the speed of sound?"
- Wow, a trick question.</i>

08:15.400 --> 08:18.393
Sound travels at a constantly
diminishing rate of speed.

08:18.480 --> 08:21.120
<i>But I believe the fastest
rate on record</i>

08:21.200 --> 08:24.193
<i>is 11,463 feet per second.</i>

08:24.280 --> 08:27.432
- How do you know all this?
- I read that this morning.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.432
Never requested
a houseguest before.

08:36.600 --> 08:37.750
Really?

08:39.440 --> 08:40.440
Hmm.

08:41.520 --> 08:45.116
I can feel it.
This is different.

08:52.040 --> 08:53.918
Eight minutes
from the junction, sir.

08:54.000 --> 08:56.151
- Hmm?
- The Westinghouse dinner.

08:57.160 --> 09:00.597
We're going home. They're tired.
I already shook enough hands today.

09:04.480 --> 09:06.073
Evening, Frank.

09:06.160 --> 09:07.196
George.

09:08.600 --> 09:09.716
Pardon?

09:10.880 --> 09:12.030
I'm not stopping.

09:13.760 --> 09:15.114
Right.

09:27.320 --> 09:29.198
Maybe the brakes are busted.

09:31.040 --> 09:32.269
I doubt that!

09:59.040 --> 10:00.997
An emergency came up
in New York.

10:23.360 --> 10:25.079
Don't let him agitate you.

10:26.080 --> 10:27.594
This is how he is.

10:28.840 --> 10:31.674
Before he was a wizard,
I let him live in my basement.

10:32.120 --> 10:33.920
My wife wouldn't have him
at the table with us

10:34.000 --> 10:35.673
unless he cleaned himself.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.911
And, boy, given the ultimatum,
the man ate alone.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.320
How does he work?

10:41.640 --> 10:44.838
You want to know his secret?
He engineers his own reality,

10:44.920 --> 10:47.196
and he looks for needles
in haystacks.

10:48.240 --> 10:50.835
And how does he know there's a needle
in the hay to begin with?

10:50.960 --> 10:52.679
He doesn't. Neither do you.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.640
But he's so determined not to be
the second person to find it,

10:55.680 --> 10:58.354
he'll go stalk by stalk
on a what-do-you-know.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.033
I will say one good thing
about him.

11:00.120 --> 11:01.713
He could be
the richest man on earth,

11:01.800 --> 11:03.917
but he doesn't give a damn
about money.

11:06.720 --> 11:08.916
What does he give
a damn about?

11:09.000 --> 11:10.753
It was rude, not stopping.

11:10.840 --> 11:13.719
I spoke to Mrs. Westinghouse directly.
I accepted the invitation.

11:14.240 --> 11:16.835
- You've embarrassed us both.
- Why do you feel embarrassed?

11:16.920 --> 11:19.674
- What do you care what people think?
- I care what they feel.

11:24.440 --> 11:25.590
Mary.

11:25.760 --> 11:27.717
Talk. I just want
to test the resistance...

11:27.800 --> 11:30.031
- Where's my barrette?
- On top of your bureau.

11:30.160 --> 11:32.240
- What's a bureau?
- It's what's under your barrette.

11:32.520 --> 11:35.877
Can I get you to promise on here
that you'll build me a fence?

11:35.960 --> 11:38.111
The ground's frozen.
Needs to thaw.

11:41.080 --> 11:42.240
Look, you're missing it!

11:43.760 --> 11:46.195
It's a baby!
Still has her spots.

11:51.480 --> 11:53.199
Tom, come see this.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.318
Tom! Tom?

12:00.280 --> 12:02.376
You want half a million dollars,
you make me something

12:02.400 --> 12:04.756
with your name on it that I can sell
to General Sherman.

12:04.840 --> 12:07.560
Counteroffer. How about
I don't give you what you want

12:07.640 --> 12:09.518
<i>but you give me
everything I want?</i>

12:12.120 --> 12:13.395
Half a million.

12:14.160 --> 12:17.915
We are gonna be
big, big, big!

12:18.040 --> 12:20.919
- Bigger than an elephant?
- And no one stops an elephant!

12:21.320 --> 12:22.800
Whoo!

14:04.080 --> 14:05.150
It'll work.

14:18.200 --> 14:20.760
Look, I got to be honest.
This might not work.

14:22.920 --> 14:24.274
Conventional wisdom has it,

14:24.360 --> 14:26.477
if you think you're gonna fall
flat on your face,

14:26.560 --> 14:28.040
better not do it in front
of a crowd.

14:31.640 --> 14:34.280
Tonight, things could change.

14:34.360 --> 14:35.760
I hope they do.

14:36.920 --> 14:38.400
And if they do,

14:39.880 --> 14:41.599
they'll change there

14:42.560 --> 14:43.755
and there.

14:46.080 --> 14:48.675
My boys and I
caught in a jar

14:48.760 --> 14:51.832
what before now has only
flashed across the night sky.

14:53.680 --> 14:56.718
What say we unscrew the lid
and see what happens?

14:59.000 --> 15:00.400
You ready?

15:01.000 --> 15:03.834
Three, two, one.

16:02.240 --> 16:06.359
<i>The man has 100,000 feet
of copper for 87 customers.</i>

16:06.440 --> 16:08.318
<i>It will never be profitable.</i>

16:09.280 --> 16:10.839
It's a hobby for the rich.

16:10.920 --> 16:12.639
Something to show off.

16:12.720 --> 16:13.756
It doesn't have to be.

16:16.520 --> 16:19.035
I'm securing the patents
on the Siemens dynamo

16:19.120 --> 16:20.600
and the Gaulard-Gibbs
transformer.

16:20.680 --> 16:23.036
Transformer? It's more like
a metal suitcase.

16:23.120 --> 16:24.554
How much did that cost?

16:25.280 --> 16:28.398
Edison, he picked
the wrong horse.

16:28.680 --> 16:31.559
His current is like a hose
with a knot in it.

16:31.640 --> 16:33.552
He needs to sell
one generator per mile.

16:33.680 --> 16:35.672
You want to build
an AC system.

16:35.760 --> 16:37.240
It's too powerful
for motors.

16:37.320 --> 16:40.040
Put doubt out of your mind
for one moment, and tell me,

16:40.160 --> 16:42.470
what distance do you estimate
one could get

16:42.560 --> 16:44.472
with a single
alternating dynamo?

16:44.560 --> 16:46.040
- A few thousand.
- Yards?

16:46.120 --> 16:47.440
- Miles.
- Mmm-hmm.

16:47.520 --> 16:49.477
And how many houses
could we reach?

16:50.040 --> 16:52.714
I suppose all of them.
What about the bulbs?

16:52.800 --> 16:54.632
Hiram's agreed
to license me his.

16:54.720 --> 16:56.871
Ah, if you're gonna rip off Edison,
rip him off right.

16:56.960 --> 16:58.440
They glow bright gray.

16:58.520 --> 17:00.796
I just want to do
a demonstration for Edison.

17:00.880 --> 17:03.349
Somewhere small,
a small town, rural.

17:03.440 --> 17:06.398
And then he'll see
alternating is possible.

17:06.800 --> 17:09.269
And we partner.
Our system, his bulbs.

17:09.359 --> 17:13.400
In my opinion, which I will admit
is based solely on physics and reality,

17:13.480 --> 17:15.790
what you want to do
is fun to talk about.

17:15.880 --> 17:17.712
I really don't think
it can be done.

17:17.800 --> 17:20.156
- Why?
- Because he would have already done it.

17:50.520 --> 17:51.954
Well, my Paris office
seems to think

17:52.040 --> 17:53.918
you may be the only man
on Earth to rival me.

17:54.800 --> 17:56.234
How would you like
to work for me?

17:56.320 --> 17:59.279
- Very much.
- I'm expanding to 12 cities,

17:59.720 --> 18:01.840
- building direct current systems...
- Direct current?

18:04.760 --> 18:06.513
Alternating current
is far more efficient.

18:06.600 --> 18:09.069
<i>- Hickory, dickory, dock...</i>
- Higher voltage,

18:09.160 --> 18:10.958
greater distance,
less copper conductors.

18:11.040 --> 18:13.839
It's lethal and it's far too much power
for a motor to handle.

18:13.920 --> 18:15.912
I'm gonna start you
on a hundred dollars a month

18:16.000 --> 18:17.798
until you prove yourself
worth more or less.

18:18.240 --> 18:19.240
A hundred dollars?

18:19.320 --> 18:22.040
If you can solve five things
that I can't, I'll pay you $50,000,

18:22.160 --> 18:23.360
and then I'll have
to fire you.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.391
Mr. Tesla,
welcome to Edison Electric.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.199
We make a minor invention
every ten days

18:28.280 --> 18:30.590
and a major one
every six months or so.

18:34.360 --> 18:35.856
You know,
I have a suspicion that,

18:35.880 --> 18:38.056
though your husband's lab is
but a hundred yards from your house,

18:38.080 --> 18:40.515
it must seem sometimes
like a hundred miles.

18:40.880 --> 18:42.837
No, a million.

18:43.320 --> 18:45.000
I've tried to find a way
to stop his brain,

18:45.040 --> 18:46.793
but it just runs and runs.

18:47.600 --> 18:49.273
It's something
he can't control.

18:49.360 --> 18:51.556
All I can do is bring
him back to center.

18:51.640 --> 18:54.553
I've heard Mr. Edison called
the worst husband in America,

18:54.640 --> 18:57.758
on account of him sleeping
in his lab on your wedding night.

18:57.840 --> 18:59.513
I've heard
the story myself.

19:03.800 --> 19:08.636
Well, on our wedding night,
Tom and I left on the Albany, uh...

19:10.120 --> 19:11.120
...boat.

19:12.240 --> 19:15.312
We spent a week
in Niagara Falls.

19:15.560 --> 19:17.279
I thought
that one week of happiness

19:17.360 --> 19:20.717
would be enough to illuminate
an entire lifetime.

19:21.080 --> 19:24.790
He was a dashing inventor,
and I worked for him, you know.

19:24.880 --> 19:25.916
I was a...

19:27.520 --> 19:29.000
I was a...

19:30.560 --> 19:31.676
Uh...

19:32.920 --> 19:34.354
I was a...

19:35.400 --> 19:36.436
Yes?

19:37.880 --> 19:38.916
Um...

19:40.760 --> 19:42.433
I'm sorry.

19:43.800 --> 19:45.393
I operated the...

19:50.160 --> 19:51.389
Telegraph?

19:51.480 --> 19:54.871
Telegraph. Yes.
Yes. Forgive me.

20:00.080 --> 20:02.197
Does he have any hobbies?

20:12.840 --> 20:15.116
You promised them
Coney Island.

20:15.200 --> 20:16.998
At the very least, a walk.

20:17.840 --> 20:20.309
We'll go on three walks tomorrow.
I promise.

20:23.520 --> 20:25.557
Here, why don't you
take a picture?

20:25.640 --> 20:26.790
Say what we practiced.

20:27.320 --> 20:28.496
Do you not
love us anymore?

20:28.520 --> 20:30.040
Do you not
love us anymore?

20:32.360 --> 20:37.276
I love you more than anybody
has ever loved anybody before.

20:54.760 --> 20:56.319
Slow down.

21:11.560 --> 21:13.153
<i>It's neuralgia,</i>

21:13.240 --> 21:15.072
brought on by eyestrain.

21:15.160 --> 21:17.720
A good pair of spectacles
is all that's required.

21:17.800 --> 21:20.076
Oh, no. I'll look awful.

21:20.160 --> 21:22.755
No, no, no, you won't.
That's impossible.

21:22.920 --> 21:24.718
You're sure? That's all?

21:24.800 --> 21:26.393
She's been having
terrible headaches.

21:26.480 --> 21:29.757
I'll leave her a vial of laudanum
until her eyes adjust.

21:29.840 --> 21:31.035
Thank you.

21:31.800 --> 21:32.870
Can you...

21:33.440 --> 21:36.353
Would you mind delaying
the bill for this visit?

21:39.520 --> 21:41.671
My son
would love an autograph.

21:42.880 --> 21:43.880
Sure.

22:09.360 --> 22:11.397
Christ, it's primitive.

22:13.440 --> 22:15.079
How much did this cost?

22:15.160 --> 22:17.800
- He won't tell me.
- What we need is here.

22:18.320 --> 22:21.631
<i>Edison's current can't travel
more than one mile, Frank.</i>

22:21.720 --> 22:24.952
<i>It peters out. He'll have
to build so many DC motors</i>

22:25.040 --> 22:27.760
<i>and bury all his copper
just to power one town.</i>

22:27.840 --> 22:30.958
<i>This country will look like
a checkerboard of power plants.</i>

22:31.040 --> 22:34.829
<i>But, with one AC dynamo,
we can step up the voltage</i>

22:34.920 --> 22:37.230
<i>and reach as far
as the eye can see.</i>

22:37.320 --> 22:39.915
<i>We string the wires
overhead on poles.</i>

22:40.000 --> 22:41.798
<i>Less copper, more electricity.</i>

22:41.920 --> 22:44.116
<i>We're 75% cheaper.</i>

22:44.200 --> 22:48.114
<i>The only thing
that matters here is distance.</i>

23:34.800 --> 23:38.555
Frank, this is as much yours
as it is mine.

23:38.680 --> 23:41.115
- I'd be proud if you'd flip the...
- I couldn't possibly.

23:41.200 --> 23:43.296
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.
- The moment belongs to you.

23:43.320 --> 23:45.437
- But you spent hours...
- George, it was your idea.

23:45.520 --> 23:46.874
You were the instigator.

23:46.960 --> 23:49.520
Shall we go for a ride?

23:57.680 --> 24:00.434
<i>"To the Wizard
of Menlo Park,</i>

24:00.520 --> 24:03.035
<i>"as it seems
your brakes have issues,</i>

24:03.120 --> 24:07.876
<i>"I would be delighted
to send my car to deliver you</i>

24:07.960 --> 24:09.917
<i>"to Great Barrington,
Massachusetts,</i>

24:10.760 --> 24:14.640
<i>"where I have successfully transmitted
current one full mile."</i>

24:17.800 --> 24:19.234
No!

24:19.880 --> 24:22.395
How did he get the bulbs?

24:24.240 --> 24:27.199
What a roaring silence
from the brightest minds of America.

24:27.280 --> 24:28.634
He's using Hiram's design.

24:28.720 --> 24:31.952
Which Hiram stole from me!

24:33.800 --> 24:34.836
Sue him.

24:34.920 --> 24:36.877
We already did.
The court upheld his patent.

24:36.960 --> 24:38.696
I'm talking about Westinghouse.
Find an angle.

24:38.720 --> 24:40.560
Take a trip to Barrington
and see for yourself.

24:40.640 --> 24:43.360
Are you not even slightly irked
that 15 years of work

24:43.440 --> 24:45.477
is being filched
from right under your eyes?

24:45.560 --> 24:47.074
Not again.

24:47.160 --> 24:51.074
I built a system here,
and he goes shopping for patents

24:51.160 --> 24:53.880
to cobble together something
to legally steal what is mine.

24:55.240 --> 24:58.597
If the bulbs are a battle,
then nail him on the dynamos.

24:58.680 --> 25:00.160
We can't.

25:01.280 --> 25:03.670
He's not even using
direct current, sir.

25:05.960 --> 25:07.599
He's using alternating?

25:15.480 --> 25:16.630
George Westinghouse?

25:18.040 --> 25:19.872
George Westinghouse?

25:20.200 --> 25:21.714
Can we help you?

25:21.800 --> 25:23.314
I came from Thomas Edison.

25:23.760 --> 25:27.071
He wants me to buy
one generator per mile?

25:27.880 --> 25:30.315
And then I saw the piece
in <i>The Globe</i> that says

25:30.400 --> 25:34.110
your electricity
would save 66% on Edison's.

25:36.320 --> 25:38.118
Well,
it's a proposed saving.

25:38.640 --> 25:40.438
And it's not my electricity.

25:41.560 --> 25:42.710
It's electricity.

25:43.160 --> 25:45.800
I think it makes much more sense
to the taxpayers of Columbus

25:45.880 --> 25:48.111
to go with
Westinghouse Electric.

25:49.080 --> 25:52.676
I don't want to compete.
I only intend to license my system.

25:52.760 --> 25:53.955
He's got the better bulbs.

25:54.040 --> 25:57.112
Why not compete? By now, he knows.
Edison knows, I promise you.

25:57.240 --> 25:59.120
<i>And the man doesn't care
about getting it right.</i>

25:59.160 --> 26:00.560
<i>He just cares
about getting it.</i>

26:00.640 --> 26:02.154
<i>But he doesn't respond.</i>

26:02.560 --> 26:04.456
Westinghouse will
never have a complete system.

26:04.480 --> 26:05.920
He can't even power
a sewing machine.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.559
But I can
solve that problem.

26:07.640 --> 26:08.936
Instead of, again,
converting the currents

26:08.960 --> 26:12.795
to work with a commutator, I would pass
alternating current differing in phase

26:12.880 --> 26:14.792
through two or more
energizing circuits.

26:14.880 --> 26:17.759
You're supposed to be working
on commutators with DC dynamos.

26:17.840 --> 26:18.840
Well, I have.

26:18.920 --> 26:20.912
Look, I have done
everything you have asked,

26:21.040 --> 26:22.713
- but you are making a mistake.
- What?

26:22.800 --> 26:24.996
Direct current may be fine
for cities when the build...

26:25.080 --> 26:28.437
When the buildings are close together,
but most of your country is empty spaces.

26:28.520 --> 26:30.216
- Only high voltage can span the distance.
- What is this?

26:30.240 --> 26:31.640
You are not thinking
long-term.

26:31.920 --> 26:33.957
This technology
is within your grasp.

26:34.040 --> 26:35.554
I can build you
an efficient motor.

26:35.640 --> 26:37.950
- Have you tried it?
- No.

26:39.320 --> 26:40.936
Look, in my head,
it is nearly complete...

26:40.960 --> 26:43.475
Men claim to have their heads
full of sonnets and symphonies,

26:43.560 --> 26:46.678
but their only problem seems to be
they can't quite write it down.

26:46.760 --> 26:47.876
- Let me try.
- No.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.311
Because I can't start again.
I got orders from Michigan.

26:51.400 --> 26:52.960
I got a roomful of press
waiting for me.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.673
Do what
you were hired to do.

26:54.800 --> 26:56.936
So, you will not honor your word
about the remuneration?

26:56.960 --> 26:59.120
- What are you talking about?
- Well, you said $50,000.

26:59.160 --> 27:00.753
Are you unhappy
with my contributions?

27:00.840 --> 27:04.038
I'm not paying you $50,000.
That was a joke.

27:04.120 --> 27:05.952
I was relying
on that income.

27:10.120 --> 27:11.376
Coconut fibers
and horn shavings

27:11.400 --> 27:13.710
and fishing lines
and cork and celluloid

27:13.800 --> 27:16.998
and flax and platinum
and iron, nickel, copper, steel.

27:17.080 --> 27:19.356
We scoured the Earth
years and years,

27:19.440 --> 27:22.319
trying thousands,
10,000 different combinations.

27:22.720 --> 27:24.837
Then George Westinghouse
saw how I did it

27:24.920 --> 27:26.320
and put on a pirate hat.

27:27.560 --> 27:30.758
You get vultures in every venture,
but you just got to keep 'em away.

27:30.840 --> 27:32.672
So, this is just
how it works?

27:32.760 --> 27:35.992
Mapmakers include mistakes in their work
to see if anyone else is copying them.

27:36.080 --> 27:37.514
I don't have that luxury.

27:37.600 --> 27:39.478
I can't invent streets
to lead the world down.

27:39.560 --> 27:41.040
Otherwise, we all end up
in the dark.

27:41.520 --> 27:43.000
Good, and remember,

27:43.080 --> 27:45.151
as much as you can
about how he's infringing.

27:45.920 --> 27:48.230
Thank you, Mr. Edison,
and thanks for this.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.150
Did I mention
that his system's lethal?

27:57.960 --> 28:01.954
Now, you reach out and touch
a doorknob or a rail, and...

28:02.040 --> 28:03.440
Well, you become the circuit.

28:04.160 --> 28:06.231
Just to be clear
on that point...

28:08.200 --> 28:09.873
Well, you die.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.958
You know, with DC current,
you can reach out

28:13.040 --> 28:15.111
and touch anything
at any stage of the line

28:15.200 --> 28:17.556
with your bare hands.
It's safe, it works,

28:17.640 --> 28:19.552
and it bears the name of Edison,
so it's pretty.

28:20.960 --> 28:22.840
Our government has been trying
for some time now

28:22.880 --> 28:24.473
to get me to invent a weapon,

28:24.560 --> 28:27.394
but I won't use this brain
to invent anything that hurts people.

28:27.840 --> 28:30.435
For that,
you can shop in Pittsburgh.

28:30.560 --> 28:32.358
So you say Westinghouse
wants to hurt people?

28:32.480 --> 28:34.756
No, I can't say that.

28:34.840 --> 28:36.115
But you can.

28:48.080 --> 28:50.231
<i>This is what
he thinks of you.</i>

28:51.600 --> 28:53.956
Issue a statement
to the papers today.

28:54.080 --> 28:55.355
Refute his charges.

28:55.440 --> 28:57.159
I'm not going
to engage with this.

28:57.240 --> 29:00.119
We have the better system.
That speaks loudest.

29:06.240 --> 29:08.914
Westinghouse Electric Company
was founded

29:09.000 --> 29:10.719
at a quarter past 9:00.

29:11.880 --> 29:14.793
Hello. I'm George Westinghouse.
Do we have an appointment?

29:14.880 --> 29:15.880
North Dakota.

29:16.760 --> 29:18.035
New Orleans.

29:18.120 --> 29:19.474
Fort Worth.

29:19.560 --> 29:20.630
Sioux City.

29:20.720 --> 29:22.757
You want the good news
or the good news?

29:22.840 --> 29:25.435
<i>Forever, hurrah,
boys, hurrah...</i>

29:26.200 --> 29:27.953
There's always more to see.

29:29.160 --> 29:31.880
Mr. and Mrs. Worthington,
Mr. Manesberg,

29:31.960 --> 29:35.431
Mr. McCoy, Mr. Faulk,
Miss Faulk, enjoy your evening.

29:37.040 --> 29:38.920
<i>We've been
spending all our time</i>

29:38.960 --> 29:40.800
<i>trying to nab him
on what's in the glass bubble</i>

29:40.840 --> 29:43.336
<i>when we should have been looking
at the clear opposite end of the bulb,</i>

29:43.360 --> 29:45.033
<i>- the corkscrew.</i>
- I own that.

29:45.120 --> 29:46.554
<i>That you do.</i>

29:46.960 --> 29:48.280
He's suing you.

29:49.080 --> 29:53.120
<i>This is a massive lawsuit.
This is Edison and Morgan.</i>

29:53.200 --> 29:55.874
<i>My advice, is there any way
that you can think of</i>

29:55.960 --> 29:57.952
<i>to beat gravity,
other than a corkscrew?</i>

29:59.280 --> 30:02.034
<i>Westinghouse designed a stopper
to get around your corkscrew.</i>

30:02.120 --> 30:04.200
<i>It's only a matter of time
before they're everywhere.</i>

30:05.680 --> 30:07.672
To tell you the truth,
I am mostly looking forward

30:07.760 --> 30:09.433
to using it
at the lumber mills.

30:09.520 --> 30:12.115
Well, at the moment,
we offer only light.

30:12.480 --> 30:15.632
In time, we'll move on
to motorized tools and appliances.

30:15.720 --> 30:18.394
When? I don't care
what light costs.

30:19.080 --> 30:23.359
My home's on gas. I'm after productivity.
I don't understand.

30:23.440 --> 30:26.877
Edison said that electricity
can already be used in the factories.

30:28.120 --> 30:29.793
Well, his can.

30:33.240 --> 30:34.720
I need to see
this needle move.

30:34.800 --> 30:37.576
I can't step the voltage down
without blowing the whole thing to pieces.

30:37.600 --> 30:39.717
Come on! You must have
made some progress.

30:39.800 --> 30:40.916
It's just not ready.

31:04.080 --> 31:05.275
Kill it! Kill it!

31:13.080 --> 31:14.992
There has to be
a solution out there.

31:20.680 --> 31:22.911
The Nikola Tesla
Electric Light Company.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.275
How does that sound?

31:24.760 --> 31:26.274
When can you bring arcs
to production?

31:26.360 --> 31:27.430
Arc lighting?

31:27.520 --> 31:28.840
I believe
we agreed to compete

31:28.920 --> 31:30.912
for incandescents,
motors, and distribution.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.514
Leave that to Edison.

31:32.600 --> 31:35.240
I am working on advanced
methods to surpass him.

31:35.320 --> 31:37.391
To beat Edison? How soon?

31:37.480 --> 31:41.269
Only a few years.
I need a lab, engineers, supplies.

31:41.360 --> 31:42.999
There are,
of course, expenses.

31:43.080 --> 31:45.151
Oh, where do you get the cash
for those fancy silks?

31:45.840 --> 31:47.638
How I spend my income
is my concern.

31:47.960 --> 31:50.316
Look, Mr. Tesla,
if you need cash now,

31:50.400 --> 31:51.914
you should
sell us your patents.

31:52.880 --> 31:55.634
- And what would I receive?
- Stock.

31:55.720 --> 31:58.838
And later, if you succeed,
you could sell it for a killing.

31:58.920 --> 32:00.513
That means a fortune.

32:00.600 --> 32:02.193
Yes, I know
what an idiom is.

32:02.280 --> 32:04.317
We'll take on two-thirds
of the risk.

32:04.440 --> 32:06.909
It's a good price for the only thing
you have to sell.

32:10.680 --> 32:12.000
"Congestion of the brain?"

32:12.040 --> 32:13.315
Well, what does that
even mean?

32:13.440 --> 32:18.595
There's a... An occlusion,
hidden, and it expands.

32:19.520 --> 32:22.115
Her eyesight
will likely go first,

32:22.200 --> 32:24.317
and then her vocabulary
will fall away.

32:24.400 --> 32:25.880
I can't lose her.

32:28.560 --> 32:31.394
I'm working on a raised alphabet.
I'll make her a dictionary.

32:31.960 --> 32:34.873
She'll gradually
lose her mobility.

32:34.960 --> 32:36.713
I'll build her an elevator.

32:37.400 --> 32:38.720
Mr. Edison,

32:39.480 --> 32:44.077
what your wife needs,
no man can build.

32:44.840 --> 32:46.911
What my wife needs,
according to you,

32:47.800 --> 32:49.553
is a simple pair
of spectacles.

32:51.480 --> 32:53.472
Nature will
take its course.

32:56.280 --> 32:57.509
I, uh...

32:58.800 --> 33:01.474
I have to leave
for New York tonight.

33:02.280 --> 33:03.794
It can't be avoided.

33:04.320 --> 33:06.994
<i>I will attend to her
while you're away, but...</i>

33:08.520 --> 33:10.034
<i>Don't linger.</i>

33:17.440 --> 33:19.511
Ohio is going
with Westinghouse.

33:19.640 --> 33:21.677
<i>- Columbus, Zanesville.
- Zanesville?</i>

33:21.760 --> 33:23.956
- Give it to him.
- That isn't funny.

33:25.320 --> 33:28.074
We don't know something is a pattern
until it happens again,

33:28.160 --> 33:30.152
which I sincerely hope
it does not.

33:30.240 --> 33:33.870
Now, you tell me, what is he doing right
that you're doing wrong?

33:33.960 --> 33:35.872
He is successfully
selling machines

33:35.960 --> 33:39.431
that will result in the accidental deaths
of human beings.

33:39.520 --> 33:41.456
- Where are these deaths?
- Where are these deaths?

33:41.480 --> 33:43.416
Why don't we switch now
and then you get to shoulder

33:43.440 --> 33:44.954
the inevitable suits
of manslaughter?

33:45.040 --> 33:46.520
I think that people
aren't dying

33:46.600 --> 33:48.990
because it's not as dangerous
as you wish it were.

33:50.680 --> 33:52.319
All right,
he's beating us on costs

33:52.400 --> 33:53.914
but that is
a temporary advantage.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.957
You give me enough time,
I'll make ours so cheap

33:56.040 --> 33:57.838
that only the rich
will burn candles.

33:57.920 --> 34:00.116
And until then,
you bleed cities to Westinghouse.

34:00.200 --> 34:03.079
- I'm not a bank.
- That is exactly what you are.

34:03.160 --> 34:05.356
We could have had
this conversation by telephone

34:05.480 --> 34:06.755
instead of you
wasting my time.

34:06.840 --> 34:08.456
Well, when I want
to see someone, he comes.

34:08.480 --> 34:09.914
Eye to eye.
That's how it works.

34:10.360 --> 34:12.397
No, here's how it works.
I build miracles,

34:12.480 --> 34:15.438
and you continue to give me as much
goddamn money as I want.

34:16.440 --> 34:18.716
Oh, what?
Did I squander another town?

34:20.520 --> 34:21.840
All right, what did I lose?

36:19.600 --> 36:21.776
<i>- What's a bureau?
- It's what's under your barrette.</i>

36:21.800 --> 36:23.176
<i>It's started.
Say something.</i>

36:23.200 --> 36:25.920
<i>Can I get you to promise
on here that you'll build me a fence?</i>

36:27.720 --> 36:30.155
<i>The ground's frozen.
Needs to thaw.</i>

36:31.960 --> 36:33.474
<i>Look, you're missing it!</i>

36:41.920 --> 36:44.913
<i>- What's a bureau?
- It's what's under your barrette.</i>

36:45.000 --> 36:46.593
<i>It's started.
Say something.</i>

36:46.680 --> 36:49.912
<i>Can I get you to promise
on here that you'll build me a fence?</i>

37:05.800 --> 37:07.678
Can I get you
anything, sir?

37:09.000 --> 37:10.354
A time machine.

37:10.880 --> 37:12.040
Yes, well,
if I ever find one,

37:12.080 --> 37:13.136
I'll travel back
to this moment

37:13.160 --> 37:14.514
and give it to you.

37:15.720 --> 37:17.234
Did you read
over the proposal?

37:17.320 --> 37:21.155
I'm not diverting what I've got left
of my resources in lighting up a fair.

37:21.240 --> 37:22.799
It's much more
than a fair, sir.

37:22.880 --> 37:25.236
A third of this country
will get on trains to Chicago

37:25.320 --> 37:28.119
to try and see
this city of light.

37:28.200 --> 37:30.157
Every window,
every streetlamp,

37:30.240 --> 37:33.074
a sign that says
the race is over and we won.

37:33.880 --> 37:36.076
Why spend your final dollars
traveling this country

37:36.160 --> 37:37.594
to show everyone
your electricity

37:37.680 --> 37:39.717
when they're all traveling
to the same place

37:39.800 --> 37:41.234
to try and see it anyway?

37:41.360 --> 37:42.880
Because in a year,
they'll rip it down.

37:42.920 --> 37:45.515
Only after 30 million people
have seen it, yes.

37:52.720 --> 37:54.757
Westinghouse is
placing a bid.

38:06.880 --> 38:09.111
Nice hat.
Looks expensive.

38:09.200 --> 38:11.431
I owned this before I worked
for you, Mr. Edison.

38:11.520 --> 38:13.352
I don't think
you are working for me.

38:13.440 --> 38:16.797
- He's still using my bulbs.
- His patents are in order.

38:17.440 --> 38:18.954
Do you want my advice?

38:19.040 --> 38:21.874
You keep saying Westinghouse's current
will kill people.

38:21.960 --> 38:25.158
So, in lieu of evidence,
why don't you provide it?

38:34.560 --> 38:36.552
We're doing this because

38:36.640 --> 38:38.950
when we have a complete system,
it works,

38:39.040 --> 38:40.440
and it's Edison...

38:41.480 --> 38:42.880
Poor bastard.

38:43.600 --> 38:45.956
Well, he was going to be
slaughtered anyway.

38:46.040 --> 38:48.077
He's not going to feel
any pain, right?

38:48.160 --> 38:50.391
At 3,000 volts,
it'll be over before it begins.

38:50.480 --> 38:51.914
So there's nothing
to worry about.

38:52.920 --> 38:54.195
But these are reporters,

38:54.280 --> 38:56.272
so you might want
to liven up a little bit.

39:00.600 --> 39:02.990
- Welcome to Menlo Park.
- How are you, sir?

39:03.080 --> 39:05.436
Thank you for coming out
on this cold morning.

39:05.520 --> 39:06.840
Good to see you again.

39:06.920 --> 39:08.320
- Good morning.
- Morning.

39:08.400 --> 39:10.153
- I'm Southwick Brown.
- A pleasure.

39:10.240 --> 39:12.400
Now, you you might all want to
stand back a little bit.

39:13.120 --> 39:15.396
Gus is being connected
to the same current

39:15.480 --> 39:17.631
that Westinghouse
uses for his generator,

39:17.720 --> 39:21.555
but there's no word yet coined
to define death by electricity.

39:21.640 --> 39:23.416
So, I asked the men
who write the dictionaries

39:23.440 --> 39:25.796
and I heard back
"electro-dite,"

39:25.880 --> 39:27.917
"electro-cremate,"
and "dyno-mort."

39:28.000 --> 39:31.880
But just as Joe Guillotin
got his name on his invention,

39:31.960 --> 39:34.316
how could we rob
the rightful inventor

39:34.400 --> 39:37.359
of death by electricity
of his due credit?

39:38.400 --> 39:41.950
I ask you to please be respectful
as we Westinghouse this horse.

40:11.720 --> 40:13.871
Mr. Edison,
Southwick Brown.

40:13.960 --> 40:15.440
Capital Punishment
Commission.

40:15.520 --> 40:17.000
You've read, no doubt,

40:17.080 --> 40:18.816
of the botched hangings
throughout the Northeast.

40:18.840 --> 40:20.832
<i>The prisoners
either choke to death</i>

40:20.960 --> 40:23.056
<i>or are violently decapitated.</i>

40:23.080 --> 40:24.673
<i>The spectacle is inhumane.</i>

40:24.760 --> 40:28.674
<i>But the horse, his death was so calm,
you could call it...</i>

40:31.000 --> 40:32.000
<i>...poetic.</i>

40:35.480 --> 40:36.516
<i>The governor of New York,</i>

40:36.600 --> 40:38.831
upon my
personal recommendation,

40:38.920 --> 40:41.355
would like to explore
a death device,

40:41.440 --> 40:43.716
which uses electricity
on a human being.

40:44.320 --> 40:47.836
It would be our honor
to award you the contract.

40:48.840 --> 40:50.991
- If nothing else, a pleasure.
- I beg your pardon.

40:51.600 --> 40:54.672
To kill a human being
under the guise of justice is...

40:54.760 --> 40:56.080
Is cockeyed.

40:56.160 --> 40:58.550
There's a big difference
between a horse and a person.

40:58.640 --> 41:01.792
God humanely brings us
into this world.

41:02.320 --> 41:04.437
Why would you reject
the opportunity

41:04.520 --> 41:08.355
to be the first man
to humanely take us out of it?

42:08.400 --> 42:09.516
William.

42:12.200 --> 42:13.759
I killed my wife.

42:28.720 --> 42:30.712
<i>I'm turning the handle.</i>

42:31.560 --> 42:33.472
<i>Maybe there's more
to it than that.</i>

42:34.520 --> 42:35.590
<i>If I'm doing it wrong,</i>

42:35.680 --> 42:39.720
<i>you'll never know I was fooling around
with your phonogram or gramophone,</i>

42:39.800 --> 42:41.678
<i>whatever you
end up calling it.</i>

42:41.920 --> 42:44.071
<i>And what is
this thing, really?</i>

42:44.840 --> 42:47.992
<i>Today's Mary is speaking
to tomorrow's Tom.</i>

42:48.640 --> 42:52.554
<i>Or from where you sit, today's Tom
is listening to yesterday's Mary.</i>

42:54.560 --> 42:56.791
<i>I wonder what else
you can do with it.</i>

43:03.320 --> 43:04.640
Mr. Tesla,

43:05.160 --> 43:08.136
my son and his idiot friend tell me
you don't want to make arc lights anymore.

43:08.160 --> 43:09.310
Is that true?

43:09.440 --> 43:10.999
Well, don't look at him,
look at me.

43:11.080 --> 43:12.355
I'm your
primary shareholder.

43:12.440 --> 43:15.080
No, I already completed
the arc light project.

43:15.160 --> 43:17.117
Completed?
You covered one city.

43:17.240 --> 43:18.674
Rahway, New Jersey.

43:18.760 --> 43:21.229
For the love of God,
think bigger. Philadelphia.

43:21.320 --> 43:24.757
You design arc lights to outfit cities.
That was your only job.

43:24.840 --> 43:27.150
No. My AC motor.

43:27.240 --> 43:29.391
- Okay? We agreed...
- No, I never agreed to anything.

43:29.480 --> 43:30.709
In this office,
you said...

43:30.800 --> 43:32.029
Ah.

43:32.120 --> 43:34.396
Lane, could you
wait outside for a moment?

43:40.920 --> 43:43.754
I'm sorry. Don't you realize
you're being fired here?

43:45.560 --> 43:46.710
No.

43:46.800 --> 43:49.713
Please, let me work through
what I have in my head.

43:49.840 --> 43:52.912
I will make you the greatest
provider of electrical power in the world.

43:53.000 --> 43:54.514
Better than Edison.

43:54.600 --> 43:57.160
I'm so close,
just a few months.

44:01.520 --> 44:04.274
I mean, you drop in here
like you're from Neptune,

44:04.360 --> 44:07.637
like you got a great vision
of the future

44:07.720 --> 44:09.496
- no one understands but you.
- Please don't touch that.

44:09.520 --> 44:11.000
You're just an immigrant.

44:12.560 --> 44:14.631
Head full of notions,
looking for a handout.

44:14.720 --> 44:16.473
You're not Edison,
there's only one Edison.

44:16.560 --> 44:18.791
That's why he's him.
There's millions of you.

44:18.880 --> 44:20.473
Big ideas.

44:20.560 --> 44:22.870
But you can't see the real force
that moves things,

44:22.960 --> 44:26.112
and it's not AC/DC,
it's not currents.

44:26.200 --> 44:27.919
It's currency.

44:28.560 --> 44:30.756
And that's the only motor
I'm interested in.

44:33.240 --> 44:37.678
These patents belong
to the Tesla Electric Light Company.

44:37.760 --> 44:41.356
Which is now the Union Electric
and Manufacturing Company,

44:41.440 --> 44:44.000
and I own everything
in this office.

44:44.080 --> 44:47.517
Patents, designs,
engineers, all mine.

44:48.720 --> 44:51.440
Never going to be anything
named Tesla ever again.

44:52.880 --> 44:56.794
You take your notions and go back
where you came from.

45:02.760 --> 45:04.960
<i>Someday I'd like
to see Niagara Falls,</i>

45:05.000 --> 45:08.596
<i>when it is frozen over,
like someone stopped the...</i>

45:08.680 --> 45:11.991
He's snapping up town
after town.

45:12.200 --> 45:15.398
Cats, dogs, sheep, 11 horses.
What more do people need to see?

45:15.480 --> 45:18.393
The problem is, is no one's
actually dying from alternating,

45:18.480 --> 45:21.359
apart from your cats, dogs,
sheep, and 11 horses.

45:22.720 --> 45:25.519
- Sir, I realize I'm only your secretary...
- Just say it.

45:25.600 --> 45:27.398
Bring the phonograph
to market.

45:27.480 --> 45:28.536
You can make your own money.

45:28.560 --> 45:31.120
- No, it needs too many improvements.
- Make them, sir.

45:31.840 --> 45:33.320
Bell is ripping you off.

45:33.400 --> 45:35.278
Graphophone?
He just switched the name.

45:35.360 --> 45:37.176
Then direct me to a store
where I can buy yours,

45:37.200 --> 45:38.456
and I won't give him
the business.

45:38.480 --> 45:40.597
You have a real offer
on the table here.

45:41.080 --> 45:42.355
Half a million dollars.

45:42.440 --> 45:44.432
Sir, take the money.
You need it.

45:45.600 --> 45:48.115
If Bell ripped you off
with the telephone,

45:48.200 --> 45:49.720
he'll do it again
with the graphophone.

45:49.800 --> 45:51.951
Did you just
misspeak intentionally?

45:52.040 --> 45:53.599
Do you want Chicago?

45:56.600 --> 45:58.159
All right, I'm ready.

46:19.960 --> 46:20.960
A dollar a ball?

46:22.080 --> 46:23.958
So, what's your trade?

46:24.040 --> 46:25.235
Inventor.

46:25.320 --> 46:27.198
I fix problems for idiots.

46:28.520 --> 46:31.433
Imagine dictation without the aid
of a stenographer.

46:33.360 --> 46:36.114
Phonographic books
that will speak to blind people.

46:36.200 --> 46:38.760
<i>Reproduction of music,
talking toys.</i>

46:39.720 --> 46:42.110
<i>Clocks that will
announce the time.</i>

46:42.200 --> 46:46.433
<i>Preservation of dying languages.
Teaching of elocution...</i>

46:46.520 --> 46:48.910
- You hustled us.
- Yes. No.

46:49.800 --> 46:51.519
I didn't come
all this way to lose.

46:51.600 --> 46:55.150
<i>The final capturing
of the dying words of your loved ones.</i>

46:55.480 --> 46:58.757
<i>Mary had a little lamb,
whose fleece was white as snow.</i>

46:58.840 --> 47:02.436
<i>And everywhere that Mary went,
the lamb was sure to go.</i>

47:04.000 --> 47:06.390
Well, it's either
not possible,

47:06.480 --> 47:08.392
or I'm not the engineer
I thought I was.

47:10.440 --> 47:14.229
He's traveling around the country,
cooking up cats.

47:14.320 --> 47:16.516
George, he's playing dirty.
You can, too.

47:17.320 --> 47:18.390
Mmm.

47:20.080 --> 47:22.549
You know, when I was a boy,
my father...

47:23.800 --> 47:25.678
He tried to whip me
with a branch.

47:26.800 --> 47:30.760
But after the first hit,
it broke into three little pieces.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.434
And we just stood there,

47:33.520 --> 47:35.716
looking at this shattered stick
on the ground.

47:37.280 --> 47:40.717
And then I noticed there was
a leather strap hanging on the wall.

47:40.840 --> 47:46.313
So I pointed to it and said,
"Look, that's the better one."

47:47.840 --> 47:49.320
And he stopped.

47:53.640 --> 47:54.915
I can take a beating,

47:55.000 --> 47:57.834
but I have no patience
for shoddy craftsmanship.

48:01.080 --> 48:02.912
You are going
to have a working motor

48:03.000 --> 48:04.957
sitting next
to your display in Chicago,

48:05.040 --> 48:08.317
come hell, high water,
or the Wizard of Menlo Park.

48:15.120 --> 48:16.952
- Good night, Frank.
- Good night.

49:16.640 --> 49:18.677
So, you admit
Edison was right?

49:41.160 --> 49:43.072
We will remember
Franklin Pope

49:44.200 --> 49:47.159
for his fearless dedication
to moving us forward.

49:47.960 --> 49:50.953
He tried to see what was hiding
in plain sight...

49:55.600 --> 49:57.239
<i>Today, I am...</i>

49:59.200 --> 50:01.476
...filled less with grief
than anger,

50:01.600 --> 50:04.399
because what happened
could have been avoided.

50:06.600 --> 50:09.638
Hear me now as you have never
heard me before.

50:10.120 --> 50:11.554
As I breathe,

50:13.560 --> 50:15.711
as long as Westinghouse
stays in business,

50:16.520 --> 50:19.035
<i>more people will die.</i>

50:28.360 --> 50:29.794
My condolences.

50:32.640 --> 50:35.280
Sounds like he was more
than just an employee.

50:40.040 --> 50:41.952
What was his name?
Franklin Popes?

50:43.240 --> 50:45.152
Pope. Just one.

50:46.560 --> 50:47.755
It's a shame.

50:47.840 --> 50:48.956
Mmm.

50:49.040 --> 50:50.440
But I'm here to help.

50:51.080 --> 50:54.835
Now, I know that you, uh...
You wish Edison would quiet down.

50:57.920 --> 51:01.118
So let me combine your companies.
Let me clean up the mess.

51:05.400 --> 51:09.280
You really think Westinghouse Electric
is worth $5 million?

51:09.360 --> 51:11.192
The value of something
is the highest number

51:11.280 --> 51:12.634
someone else
is willing to pay.

51:12.720 --> 51:16.191
But 800 men
will lose their livelihoods.

51:16.280 --> 51:17.839
I will keep your workers.

51:18.560 --> 51:21.632
I will not make the same promise
for your five-day workweek.

51:22.080 --> 51:23.150
Mmm.

51:24.880 --> 51:26.917
Seems like you're amenable.

51:37.600 --> 51:39.557
Which current will you use?

51:40.760 --> 51:43.036
Whichever Edison selects,
I suppose.

51:55.360 --> 51:58.478
You've crossed into territory
for the Confederacy.

51:59.280 --> 52:00.280
No, I, uh...

52:01.080 --> 52:04.278
I think you're mistaken.
According to my map here...

52:24.600 --> 52:26.831
Though I mourn
the loss of my colleague,

52:26.920 --> 52:29.389
misfortune does not
trump progress.

52:31.840 --> 52:36.357
Now, it seems to me that Mr. Edison
puts his name on everything

52:36.440 --> 52:39.160
because he's terrified
of being forgotten.

52:40.480 --> 52:43.473
If you want to be remembered,
it's simple. Shoot a president.

52:44.240 --> 52:47.472
But if you prefer to have
what I call a legacy,

52:47.600 --> 52:50.559
you leave the world
a better place than you found it.

52:51.160 --> 52:54.597
Thomas Alva Edison
is a charlatan

52:54.680 --> 52:58.196
who preys on the fears
of the common man

52:58.720 --> 53:00.677
because I have
the better system.

53:01.920 --> 53:04.719
And because I do have
the better system,

53:04.800 --> 53:07.110
Westinghouse Electric
shall endure.

53:07.200 --> 53:08.429
Good day.

53:09.760 --> 53:11.680
<i>Westinghouse
has taken the lead.</i>

53:11.880 --> 53:13.280
<i>He's not going away.</i>

53:13.360 --> 53:15.397
<i>And while I appreciate
your lights, Mr. Edison,</i>

53:15.480 --> 53:16.914
<i>I'm also your customer.</i>

53:17.280 --> 53:20.398
<i>If someone comes to my door
and offers me something that I need</i>

53:20.480 --> 53:23.439
that is better than what I have now,
at a cheaper price,

53:23.520 --> 53:26.797
why, I'd be a fool
not to invite him in for tea.

53:26.880 --> 53:29.440
- Is this an ultimatum?
<i>- More of a threat.</i>

53:29.560 --> 53:31.916
<i>If you maintain that fear
is the best strategy,</i>

53:32.000 --> 53:33.992
<i>then you'd better hurry up
and try harder.</i>

53:35.480 --> 53:36.630
Time's up.

53:40.320 --> 53:41.993
<i>A man who is handsome
and clever</i>

53:42.080 --> 53:46.393
<i>built a box with a crank and
a lever to store his wife's voice.</i>

53:46.480 --> 53:48.358
<i>But he made a poor choice,</i>

53:48.440 --> 53:51.672
<i>because now
she can tease him forever.</i>

53:54.800 --> 53:56.837
<i>I couldn't stop it
if I wanted to.</i>

53:58.560 --> 54:00.040
Which I don't,

54:00.120 --> 54:03.670
because I think
it's a remarkable gift.

54:05.200 --> 54:09.240
Electricity will kill
that man in Buffalo.

54:10.160 --> 54:13.073
All we need is your advice,
Mr. Edison.

54:13.160 --> 54:16.915
Where to put the electrodes.
How much is humane?

54:17.640 --> 54:21.839
And in exchange, I promise you
something that I know you want.

54:21.920 --> 54:24.276
Otherwise, you wouldn't
let me talk to you.

54:26.760 --> 54:29.798
I will put
the Westinghouse name

54:29.880 --> 54:33.237
right out front
as the official electricity

54:33.320 --> 54:35.516
used to kill human beings.

54:43.440 --> 54:45.636
My name must never be
associated with this.

54:45.760 --> 54:47.513
I did not provide
any consultation,

54:47.600 --> 54:51.753
and you will advertise that Westinghouse
is the best way to take a human life.

54:52.400 --> 54:54.517
You guarantee
your assistance?

54:56.360 --> 54:58.272
If you ask a question,
I'll reply.

55:02.640 --> 55:03.994
Burn the correspondence.

55:05.640 --> 55:06.869
Absolutely.

55:10.200 --> 55:13.477
Fauteuils
and blue-painted bergÃ¨re.

55:13.560 --> 55:16.029
I sold three sets of these
last week alone.

55:18.560 --> 55:22.236
Oh, uh, this is your
classic spindle back. Oh, yes.

55:22.880 --> 55:26.191
And these are framed Cockpen.
Yeah, quite popular.

55:32.800 --> 55:34.314
Oh, deportment style.

55:37.160 --> 55:39.675
Would you like four,
six, eight, twelve?

55:40.000 --> 55:41.195
Just one.

55:42.680 --> 55:46.594
<i>Mr. Brown, the apparatus
consists of a stationary engine,</i>

55:46.680 --> 55:50.560
<i>a Westinghouse alternating dynamo

55:50.640 --> 55:54.316
<i>wood chair with headrest, binding straps,

55:54.400 --> 55:56.960
<i>Burn. TAE.</i>

56:05.120 --> 56:07.874
<i>"The voltmeter, ammeter,

56:07.960 --> 56:10.520
<i>"should be located

56:10.600 --> 56:12.557
<i>"Burn. TAE."</i>

56:12.680 --> 56:14.736
<i>"The dynamo room is communicated

56:14.760 --> 56:16.160
<i>"Burn. TAE."</i>

56:16.240 --> 56:17.296
<i>"The most

<i>"manufactured

56:18.440 --> 56:19.669
<i>"Burn. TAE."</i>

56:19.760 --> 56:23.674
<i>"I authorize payment

56:23.760 --> 56:25.353
<i>"Burn. TAE."</i>

56:25.440 --> 56:27.591
<i>"Mr. Brown, the only argument

56:27.680 --> 56:30.240
<i>"against Westinghouse

56:30.320 --> 56:32.516
<i>"is that the flesh may burn

56:32.600 --> 56:34.398
<i>"and the amount of current

56:34.480 --> 56:37.234
<i>"without such mutilation
is not yet known.</i>

56:37.320 --> 56:40.154
<i>"Burn. TAE."</i>

56:51.000 --> 56:53.240
For someone who's trying to compete
for the World's Fair,

56:53.280 --> 56:54.896
this death chair business
doesn't look good.

56:54.920 --> 56:55.956
Yeah, I know.

56:56.040 --> 56:59.192
It's just Edison trying
to smear me as usual.

56:59.280 --> 57:01.272
- Can you prove it?
- No.

57:01.360 --> 57:03.795
But I was thinking
maybe I could stop it.

57:03.880 --> 57:05.314
You mean me?

57:07.040 --> 57:10.192
If you want my advice,
don't hire me. Save your money.

57:11.280 --> 57:15.274
But I do know a man
who could determine whether Edison

57:15.360 --> 57:17.829
has an exploitable connection
with the death chair.

57:17.920 --> 57:21.311
No, I was thinking we could
stop him via legal means.

57:22.680 --> 57:25.036
- You want me to put Edison on trial?
- No.

57:25.120 --> 57:27.430
The chair itself.
The Eighth Amendment.

57:27.520 --> 57:32.470
So I'm to get an axe murderer
who readily admits he slaughtered his wife

57:32.560 --> 57:34.472
a what?
A sustainment?

57:34.560 --> 57:39.157
This is about showing what kind of
a man is Thomas Edison.

57:41.280 --> 57:43.033
You just keep
my name out of it.

57:43.120 --> 57:45.112
Does your wife know
you're paying for this?

57:45.680 --> 57:46.955
It was her idea.

57:47.680 --> 57:51.674
<i>The State calls
Thomas Alva Edison.</i>

57:51.760 --> 57:53.911
<i>Will you explain, generally,</i>

57:54.000 --> 57:56.560
<i>the difference between
your continuous current</i>

57:56.640 --> 58:00.520
<i>and Mr. Westinghouse's
alternating electricity?</i>

58:00.600 --> 58:04.071
A continuous current flows
like water through a pipe,

58:04.160 --> 58:06.470
and alternating current
flows in both directions.

58:06.560 --> 58:08.438
Water? That doesn't
sound so dangerous.

58:08.520 --> 58:10.398
Not until you drown.

58:10.480 --> 58:15.600
Suppose you took this
wicked Westinghouse current,

58:16.080 --> 58:19.039
the one that is going to be used
on Mr. Kemmler here.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.913
Now, suppose you kept it up
for five or six minutes

58:23.760 --> 58:26.036
at 1,500 volts,

58:26.800 --> 58:29.315
how long would it take
before he would feel the heat?

58:29.440 --> 58:32.353
Well, the temperature
might rise

58:32.520 --> 58:34.671
four or five degrees
above normal

58:34.760 --> 58:37.719
and continue
until he was mummified.

58:37.960 --> 58:39.917
And this wouldn't cause
considerable pain?

58:40.000 --> 58:42.196
- It would not.
- How do you know?

58:42.320 --> 58:44.630
Because I personally
observed such electricity

58:44.720 --> 58:46.951
being used to execute
a thousand-pound horse.

58:47.040 --> 58:48.120
And did the horse
feel pain?

58:48.200 --> 58:49.416
If he did,
he didn't mention it.

58:52.200 --> 58:54.669
Now, Mr. Edison,
there is a great degree of feeling

58:54.800 --> 58:56.837
between you
and Mr. Westinghouse.

58:56.920 --> 58:59.674
I do not dislike
Mr. Westinghouse.

58:59.760 --> 59:01.920
There's a contest
between you two, isn't there?

59:02.000 --> 59:03.912
That is not
what this is about.

59:05.080 --> 59:07.276
I've been asked
as a dispassionate scientist

59:07.360 --> 59:08.840
to advise
on the simple question

59:08.920 --> 59:10.096
of whether death
by electricity

59:10.120 --> 59:13.238
is a violation of the Eighth Amendment
and is cruel and unusual.

59:13.360 --> 59:14.680
In my expert opinion,

59:14.760 --> 59:16.797
the only humane method
of execution

59:16.880 --> 59:18.360
is Westinghouse
alternating current.

59:18.440 --> 59:21.280
Your Honor, Mr. Edison knows that
any current over 30 amperes...

59:21.320 --> 59:22.776
Milliamperes.
If you're going to interrupt,

59:22.800 --> 59:24.951
at least do so
in the proper denominations.

59:27.440 --> 59:29.716
- Well, thank you, Your Honor.
- It's my honor.

59:30.040 --> 59:32.919
All right. That's all I need to hear.

59:41.280 --> 59:43.749
Mr. Edison,
can I get a comment?

59:43.840 --> 59:45.520
What do you two
lowlifes want, huh?

59:46.000 --> 59:47.256
- Mr. Edison.
- What?

59:47.280 --> 59:49.033
- Mr. Edison.
- Huh?

59:52.320 --> 59:53.515
Now, look...

59:53.600 --> 59:55.536
I thought you were going to
leave before I had a chance.

59:55.560 --> 59:57.074
Mr. Edison,
can I get your autograph?

59:57.960 --> 59:59.155
Yeah, sure, I...

59:59.280 --> 01:00:01.715
William, do you mind?

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:03.792
Thank you. Thank you.

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:07.990
Use this.

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:14.870
I should warn you,

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:17.191
there's one thing
that always beats justice.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.280
Money?

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:19.360
Fame.

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:41.039
Oh, is that
a New Model Army revolver?

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:43.476
What a lovely machine
that is.

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:46.475
- You know how it works?
- You want me to show you?

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:50.156
Oh, I didn't mean how it fires.
I simply meant how it works.

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:53.389
It's quite a device.
You should have a look.

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:54.994
You see,
they designed the cylinder

01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:58.960
so the hammer doesn't have to sit
in an empty chamber.

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:04.951
Edison lied
on the stand.

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:09.275
If you're going to take your shot,
now is the last time to fire.

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:12.831
Sometimes, we have to work outside
of the rules to get what's right.

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:16.552
It would be nice
if we didn't have to.

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.310
Wouldn't it?

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:22.676
Look, this doesn't
make you like him.

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:23.796
Mmm.

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:27.519
So, what will it be?

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.310
In my bad ear,
it sounded extraordinary.

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:29.470
Father.

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:34.360
Hello.

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:37.274
"The apparatus consists

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:48.656
<i>Those letters are stolen.</i>

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:51.240
- You can't publish them.
<i>- Why not?</i>

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:52.959
Because they're private
correspondences.

01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:57.199
Mr. Edison, you say something
about me or my company again,

01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:59.272
I would ask that
you tell the truth.

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:03.275
That would be
the decent thing to do.

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.276
Wouldn't it?

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:08.200
<i>Why didn't you
burn the letters?</i>

01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:10.118
<i>They were
from Thomas Edison.</i>

01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:13.234
<i>I don't think you appreciate
that this chair is something</i>

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:15.312
to be proud of
and remembered for.

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:17.960
I don't even know
how much electricity you need to use.

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:21.477
- You said 1,500 volts.
- I said I think 1,500 volts.

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.358
But if all the water
in his body evaporates,

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:25.352
- then he may ignite.
- So we lower the amount.

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:27.272
And then you slowly
roast him to death.

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:28.999
Listen,
you must listen to me.

01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:30.878
What you're going
to do is wrong.

01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:33.680
Now, you said that it's inevitable
and somebody else will do it.

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:35.456
But just because
somebody else is gonna do it

01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:36.994
doesn't mean that
you have to.

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:42.039
The state thanks you
for your expert opinion and your help.

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:01.076
What?

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.797
- It's not my place to say.
- Say it.

01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:09.479
You said you'd never build
a device that would kill anyone.

01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:21.758
I make something impossible,
and they rip it away from me,

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:24.196
so I do it again,
and they do it again

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:26.556
and again and again.

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:30.958
But this isn't like
everything else.

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:34.072
This is everything else.

01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:37.596
Our future's not going
to be paved with bricks,

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:39.840
but with copper.

01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:43.470
Automation, transportation,
communication.

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:47.076
And the man that controls that current
controls that future.

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:50.472
But you know
Westinghouse is right.

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:54.430
You don't actually believe
that a few accidents

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:57.194
rule out the viability of his current.
You just don't want to lose.

01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:00.591
I have merely amplified what no one
else was willing to take seriously.

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:02.114
No, what you did
was run him over

01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:03.554
- with a 12-ton train.
- Oh, well.

01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:05.560
He's the one that's supposed
to only make brakes,

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:06.954
so who's to blame here?

01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:12.556
Switch tonight,
and you win.

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:14.677
His current kills people.

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:15.989
Only because
you said it will!

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.656
Listen, I either stop complaining
about the scavengers in my garden

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:20.194
or build a wall
so damn high

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:22.351
that people will never
even dare to scale it.

01:05:22.480 --> 01:05:24.358
You are the smartest man
I know.

01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:27.598
Beyond building miracles
out of thin air,

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.592
I was most impressed
by your principles.

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:33.673
You didn't invent
the incandescent.

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:35.433
People just think you did.

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:47.716
Let me welcome you to the reality of
how things come into existence.

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:50.235
We all contribute.
That's what invention is.

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:54.635
The salt, the grain,
the heat, the heart.

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:58.276
But only one man
makes the bread rise.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.117
That's the one
that puts it all together,

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:05.753
makes it taste so damn good
that people will go out there

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:09.720
and hand over
their hard-won dollars to buy it.

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:13.118
Mr. Edison, I want you
to succeed, I do.

01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:16.920
But you have
to switch tonight,

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.516
or you'll die as P.T. Barnum
rather than Sir Isaac Newton.

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:45.191
<i>Though he may be
unfamiliar to you,</i>

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:49.160
<i>his studies have demonstrated
an understanding of electrical matters</i>

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:53.314
<i>unlike anyone I have ever known,
with respect to the assembled.</i>

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:55.676
Gentlemen and lady,

01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:57.433
<i>Nikola Tesla.</i>

01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:02.797
<i>Straight to our
ultimate question.</i>

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:05.079
<i>Yes or no,</i>

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:08.633
can alternating currents
operate a motor?

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:11.080
Yes.

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:15.116
<i>Now, anyone who builds
an alternating system</i>

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:19.035
<i>will be able to do what Edison can
for only a third of the cost.</i>

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:20.634
In Figure 2
of my polyphase system,

01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:22.960
the armature coils are shown
in a more advanced position.

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:24.776
2A illustrates
the corresponding magnetic

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:26.560
condition of the ring.
A synchronous motor...

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:28.656
...a laminated ring provided
with pole projections...

01:07:28.680 --> 01:07:30.990
The induction is
of an ideal character,

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:33.595
being always maintained
at its maximum action.

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:36.878
Mr. Tesla, have you actually built
the motor to test your theories?

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:39.759
Well, they are not theories.
No, I have not built it.

01:07:39.880 --> 01:07:43.032
- But that would prove your beliefs.
- But they are not beliefs.

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:44.674
And it is absolutely
immaterial to me

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:46.717
whether I run the motor
in my mind or in a shop,

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:48.871
for I have built it already
in my imagination,

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.036
and it is perfect.

01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:52.112
- Are you serious?
- Almost always.

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:03.517
Hello,
I'm George Westinghouse.

01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:15.712
- George Westinghouse.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:18.554
An engine that compresses air
into a tank,

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:21.758
which is taken via pipe
to each brake on the train,

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:24.354
allowing them
to operate simultaneously.

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:27.035
Smart design.

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:28.916
Thank you.

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:38.160
Please.

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:56.630
I think this entire room
is slanted two degrees.

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:03.032
I sincerely appreciate you

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:05.395
taking the time
to meet with me.

01:09:05.479 --> 01:09:07.790
Are you going somewhere?

01:09:19.319 --> 01:09:20.435
Oh.

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.395
This is it?

01:09:23.479 --> 01:09:25.756
- It's Niagara Falls.
- Yeah.

01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:28.799
And ever since my school days,
I have pictured in my imagination

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:31.236
a big wheel
spinning out lightning.

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:34.816
Did you know that when
I first came to this country,

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:37.196
- I worked for Mr. Edison?
- I did not.

01:09:37.279 --> 01:09:39.112
- Tea?
- Sure.

01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:42.880
I fixed two of his DC generators
in one night,

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:45.236
and he called me
"a damn good man."

01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:49.560
So, why did he not treat me
that way? I quit.

01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:53.189
Tried my own company
and was deceived. Who was I?

01:09:53.279 --> 01:09:54.634
Some immigrant.

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:58.114
So I took the only job
I could find, digging a ditch.

01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:00.840
The men laughed
at my fine clothes,

01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:03.037
but at the end of the day,
I had two dollars.

01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:08.116
What was the ditch
to be used for?

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:11.118
Edison Electric.

01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:14.472
It felt like digging
my own grave.

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:18.680
If Mr. Edison succeeds,
he will set us back so far,

01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:20.035
we may never recover.

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:24.239
The fair must be alternating.
It must be my motor.

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:27.229
I have watched as the world talks
of Chicago as a symbol,

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:29.039
a city of light.

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:32.559
All cities will have light
in your lifetime,

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:35.350
but harnessing
the power of Niagara,

01:10:35.840 --> 01:10:37.479
that is to see our future.

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:38.676
The falls?

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:41.514
I'm here to talk
about Chicago.

01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:42.954
Think beyond Chicago.

01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:46.954
Energy is as fundamental
as food, as water, as air.

01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:49.236
You can... You cannot say
that only those with money

01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:51.073
can eat or can breathe.

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:53.472
Yes, the falls will light up
the Eastern Seaboard.

01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:55.056
Yes, there is
a great fortune to be made,

01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:58.073
and I covet a very nice walking stick
I saw on 63rd and Madison,

01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:01.073
but Niagara is the proof that one day
we may detach power from profit.

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.152
- That is how you truly win.
- Mmm.

01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:06.910
- How do I know you will not cheat me?
- Well...

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:09.196
You don't.

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:13.391
But the fact is, Mr. Tesla,
I need your motor.

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:17.637
I may be able to light up the fair,
but I still can't move a machine.

01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:19.677
If we cannot reach
an agreement today,

01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:22.832
my company will die right here
in your hotel room.

01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:27.517
But if it does perish,
so might your dream

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:29.717
of harnessing power
from Niagara.

01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:35.909
So, do we have a deal?

01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:39.032
Five thousand.

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:48.313
One thousand.

01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:01.030
Yeah.

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:05.991
I'll give you $2.50.

01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:11.833
Per horsepower.

01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:17.354
I'm no genius myself,
but that should be millions.

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.674
May I treat you to dinner at Delmonico's?

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:25.791
All right, Mr. Tesla,
time to go.

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:27.473
No, I will not leave
your slanted room.

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:29.120
He hasn't paid his bill
in over a month.

01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:32.153
Well, how much would it cost
to keep him here for the year?

01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:41.316
I need to shed 300 men
from the gas company.

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:46.312
There's no way around it.

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:50.193
So, we pay their salaries
and move them to electricity.

01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:52.192
We can't keep doing this.

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:55.670
If we win,
we won't have to.

01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:59.512
You have truth
on your side.

01:13:01.640 --> 01:13:02.756
And whatever happens,

01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:04.115
you know you never
did anything

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:05.600
but play fair.

01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:19.357
I stole the letters

01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:22.080
linking Edison
to the death chair.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.560
I gave them to the papers
to smudge him.

01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:29.993
I know you're disappointed
in me.

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:01.072
What am I
looking at here?

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:02.759
An 80-foot-tall tower,

01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:06.595
covered with 16,000 Edison bulbs,
topped with an eight-foot lighthouse,

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:09.070
that signals to the world
that we are the victors.

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:11.152
Otherwise, how will people
know that we won?

01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:12.640
It's an idol.

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:16.111
It's a signature.

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:19.229
And you'll get something
that no one's ever received

01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:20.595
from Thomas Edison before.

01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:22.433
- Oh, yes? What's that?
- An apology.

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:27.034
I admit the spending has been
more than I anticipated,

01:14:27.120 --> 01:14:28.190
but now more than ever,

01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:29.919
it's important
you must push through.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.469
Whatever Westinghouse
is bidding for the fair, we...

01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:34.115
You must bid more.

01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:35.240
I must?

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:37.796
"Must."

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:41.640
Who's Nikola Tesla?

01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:45.676
What about him?

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:47.513
Well, he gave
a talk at Columbia.

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:52.519
Word is the Serb is building
Westinghouse a polyphase motor.

01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:54.478
Light and power.

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:56.950
You can do both.
He now may as well.

01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:59.840
Who even knows how long it'll take them
to build a functioning model...

01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:02.435
As of this morning,
you have ceded, I have here,

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.435
nine more cities
to Westinghouse.

01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:07.756
So,
here's what's happening.

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:13.317
I am merging Edison Electric
with some of the other ankle biters.

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:15.517
You are out.

01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:17.474
Do you know why?

01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:19.390
And I'm happy to tell you,

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:21.915
if you require this moment
to be even more unpleasant.

01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.117
You will receive stock

01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:26.351
and you will retain
a seat on the board.

01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:34.554
Who's going
to present? You?

01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:35.640
Good God, no.

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:37.433
- You tell me now.
- I was here.

01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:39.360
I thought you deserved
to hear it face-to-face.

01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:40.510
No, you didn't.

01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:42.359
You just wanted
to waste my time

01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:44.955
and get me to sign
autographs for children.

01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:47.096
What are you going
to call it, then?

01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:49.999
- That's your concern?
- Edison Electric. It has to be.

01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:52.595
Edison and electricity
are synonymous, Morgan.

01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:56.037
Do not attach a losing name
to a fledgling enterprise.

01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:57.474
Now that your letters
have leaked,

01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:59.096
- you've lost credibility.
- So, what is it?

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:01.396
- The name?
- Yes, the goddamn name!

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:03.336
On the contracts,
it just says "General Electric,"

01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:05.477
but I'll think of something.
I can be creative, too.

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:12.196
Yeah.

01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:16.000
Mr. Insull.

01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:18.989
A word.

01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:56.200
Damn it!

01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:01.792
He said they'd keep your name attached
as long as you didn't pursue action

01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:04.236
or speak negatively to the press
about the merger.

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:05.515
What did he offer you?

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:07.320
Tell me.

01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:08.696
Vice president,
but I turned it down.

01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:09.915
- You should take it.
- Why?

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.856
Alternating current,
what's the transmission voltage?

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:12.916
230,000 volts.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.912
What's the filament
on a 12,000-hour lamp?

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.096
- Carbonized Japanese bamboo.
- What do I eat for breakfast?

01:17:17.120 --> 01:17:18.376
- Pie.
- So, what's the surprise?

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:21.074
Of course, he needs you.
You're me but a human being.

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:32.073
Look around the room.

01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:33.355
Who's missing?

01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:38.589
Edison General
Electric Company, please.

01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:40.034
General Electric?

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:42.757
Edison General
Electric Company?

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:43.840
- Yes.
- Ah.

01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:45.115
Hi. Excuse me.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.639
He's 12.

01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:02.155
Mr. Insull, these are
the committee members

01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:04.476
<i>- of Grounds and Buildings...
- Listen closely.</i>

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:05.880
<i>Focus on the quality
of the light.</i>

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:07.997
I don't care
what the courts say.

01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:09.799
<i>Westinghouse ripped off
my bulbs,</i>

01:18:09.880 --> 01:18:12.395
<i>and the good news for you
is he did a terrible job.</i>

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:15.996
They're outdoor bulbs,
so they have a life of about two hours.

01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:18.197
So, focus on
the replacement time.

01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:22.191
Talk about the superiority of
ours as if there's no competition.

01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:27.716
Use terms like, "standard," "purest,"
and "the most beautiful light," etc.

01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:30.416
<i>Find out what kind of men they are.
There are really only two types.</i>

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:32.352
The first believe themselves
to be practical,

01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:33.874
<i>but they're secret dreamers.</i>

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:35.872
<i>They're the ones
who will take the risks.</i>

01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:38.714
<i>The second, well, they'll smile
and thank you for the show,</i>

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:40.280
<i>but they'll vote
with their wallets.</i>

01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:44.394
Now, unless Westinghouse is mortgaging
everything he's worth on this bid,

01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:46.056
<i>Morgan has you in good stead
with the moneymen.</i>

01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:48.515
<i>So, your only real job is
to look the dreamers in the eye</i>

01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:49.829
<i>and promise them magic.</i>

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:51.640
<i>Now, explain back to me</i>

01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:53.712
everything that you remember
about a parallel

01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:56.480
and series of electric circuits using
none of the words I just said.

01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:01.120
Should you choose
Westinghouse, then...

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:04.830
Then, yes, there is a possibility
you'll be putting in jeopardy

01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:06.991
the lives
of 28 million people.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.311
Even if Westinghouse were
to make even the smallest of errors,

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:13.559
unintentional, of course,

01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:17.477
a visiting politician, a wife,
even a seven-year-old girl

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:20.553
may lean against a lamp post
and be struck dead immediately.

01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.036
There you have it.

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:26.077
Mr. Westinghouse's brand
of electricity is fatal.

01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:28.277
Thank you, Mr. Insull.

01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:31.195
Just to be clear, sir,
any electrical current

01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:33.351
over 200 milliamperes
can be deadly.

01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:34.635
Even yours?

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:44.559
Mr. Westinghouse, these are
the committee members

01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:48.429
of Grounds and Buildings,
Charles Schwab, Craig Cannon,

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:50.751
- Mayor Cregier, of course.
- Of course.

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:53.230
Victor Lawson
of the <i>Chicago Daily News,</i>

01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:55.551
and the Honorable
Judge Tree.

01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:59.111
Respectfully, we ask that you
please keep your remarks to one hour.

01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:01.554
That won't be necessary.

01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:04.471
- There you go. Sir.
- Thank you.

01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:07.590
Hmm.

01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:10.630
My bid.

01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:14.160
- These are all your figures?
- Yes, sir.

01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:15.799
Independent estimates.

01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:18.714
Let us begin with this most
general question.

01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:21.715
Why should we grant
Westinghouse Electric

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:23.632
the contract
for the World's Fair?

01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:28.437
Well, I guess because our system
works significantly better.

01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:29.749
And, uh...

01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:34.759
Because our system
is significantly cheaper.

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:43.155
Mr. Schwab, Mr. Higinbotham,
Mr. Cannon,

01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:45.072
Mayor Cregier, Mr. Lawson,

01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:47.914
Judge Tree,
and Mr. Burnham,

01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:51.354
thank you very much for your time
and your consideration.

01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:10.479
<i>Financially, it's clear.
We just take the better bid.</i>

01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:13.434
- Look, Westinghouse is dangerous.
- Potentially dangerous.

01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:15.079
You even printed it
in your own paper.

01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:19.074
<i>Alternating will be used
to kill that man in Buffalo.</i>

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:33.191
<i>They both
light up lights, right?</i>

01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:34.873
Westinghouse will
save us some money.

01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:36.553
<i>Thomas Edison sells tickets.</i>

01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:42.239
What I wouldn't give
to flip through that.

01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:45.270
It's like a handbook
to the future, isn't it?

01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:51.118
<i>We need
a clear majority, gentlemen.</i>

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:53.200
- Don't you have stock in GE?
- That's irrelevant.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.435
<i>No one has ever done
what you have done for me.</i>

01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:01.351
Well, the value of something
isn't what someone's willing to pay,

01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:04.160
but the value of something
is what it contributes.

01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:05.840
When we vote again,

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:07.752
Burnham, you can telephone
the winner tonight.

01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:15.475
Is it true you were born
during a lightning storm?

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:17.270
It is true.

01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:18.710
Hmm.

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:22.875
All right. Tell me
one thing in that book.

01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:28.360
Look, you and Mr. Edison, you spend
all your time on either end of the system,

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:30.198
the dynamos and the lamps.

01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:32.237
But what about
what is in between?

01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:33.470
- The wires?
- Mmm.

01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:36.030
Do we need them?

01:22:51.120 --> 01:22:53.840
Is that a New Model
Army revolver?

01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:55.274
<i>You know how it works?</i>

01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:57.875
<i>You see,
they designed the cylinder</i>

01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:01.317
so the hammer doesn't have
to sit in an empty chamber.

01:23:01.400 --> 01:23:04.677
<i>The problem is, despite
all the advantages of the Remington,</i>

01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:06.160
it doesn't fix the fact

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:08.118
that you just dampened
your gunpowder.

01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:48.680
What's this?

01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:50.960
This is gonna do
for the eye

01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:52.918
what the phonograph
did for the ear.

01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:17.480
Again.

01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:21.880
Again!

01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:56.757
Do you have any final words?

01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:01.000
I believe
I'm going to a better place.

01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:04.959
Goodbye, William.

01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:17.389
We live
in a higher civilization

01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:19.400
from this day.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:37.198
"An awful spectacle,
far worse than hanging.

01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:38.839
"George Westinghouse,

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:41.071
"'They would have
done better with an axe.'

01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:42.480
"Sizzling sound.

01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:46.031
"A billow of smoke that filled the room
with the odor of burning hair."

01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:49.317
Well, at least it happened
to a murderer.

01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:53.879
At least they'll never
use it again to kill anyone.

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:03.715
And soon all these people
will have electric light,

01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:06.036
and no one will even remember
it ever happened.

01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:09.510
I have books
so full of ideas,

01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:12.718
it would take me more than 12 lifetimes
to execute them.

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:16.794
So let the man have
his fair and waterfall.

01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:23.440
Well, for what it's worth,

01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:26.240
I'd much rather have worked for you
than Westinghouse any day.

01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:28.829
Why is that?

01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:31.916
Well, I wouldn't have had
as much fun, would I?

01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:32.550
Have you seen
much of the fair?

01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:34.518
A Muybridge lecture,
"Little Egypt."

01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:35.954
Oh, the dancer?

01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:37.315
- You saw her?
- No.

01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:39.190
Oh, she was...

01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:41.360
If you get the time.

01:29:42.240 --> 01:29:43.435
Hmm.

01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:50.720
Don't you think a fence
is a unique creation?

01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:55.871
Your neighbor puts one up,
and suddenly one becomes two.

01:29:56.720 --> 01:29:58.234
You also have a fence.

01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:00.955
There's only one problem.

01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:03.470
See, one person on one side
of the fence designed it,

01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:05.836
one person
on one side built it,

01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:08.077
and one person
paid for it,

01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:11.949
and yet the other person
receives a fine, free fence.

01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:15.994
I didn't take your ideas.

01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:18.680
Mr. Edison?

01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:20.840
Sure.

01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:23.990
Thank you.

01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:26.792
You know, I was wondering
about one thing.

01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:28.519
Oh, I'm sure
there were many.

01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:30.193
I was gonna
invite you to dinner.

01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:31.356
Again.

01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:34.520
But I suppose now
is as good a time as any.

01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:36.432
You want to know what was
in the 13-hour bulb?

01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:38.398
- I know how it works.
- Yeah, I know you do.

01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:40.199
I only wondered
what it felt like.

01:30:42.200 --> 01:30:43.714
- What?
- The bulb.

01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:45.836
When you knew.

01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:49.035
What was the feeling
in that moment?

01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:58.999
I can't tell you.
I mean...

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.595
It's impossible
to describe the feeling,

01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:05.637
because it was impossible.

01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:07.595
Years of work.

01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:09.592
10,000
different filaments.

01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:12.191
When the thread went
in the bulb, as usual,

01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:13.549
we placed our bets,

01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:16.599
and the generator sputtered
to life, and the ball began to glow,

01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:19.195
we didn't expect anything
but another failure.

01:31:21.120 --> 01:31:22.839
Then something
started to happen.

01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:29.678
See, our best filament
only lasted ten minutes,

01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:33.472
and this fluke
was rounding 20,

01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:35.836
so people started
to chatter.

01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:39.755
And 30 minutes, 40 minutes,
an hour, two hours...

01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:41.797
Then people
started to shout.

01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:45.119
And remember, we hadn't
got past ten minutes.

01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:47.157
The boys
were climbing up the walls,

01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:48.640
tearing their hair out...

01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:52.433
Because it was impossible.

01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:56.831
Seven hours,
eight hours, nine.

01:31:58.280 --> 01:32:00.078
We were silent
when we hit ten.

01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:04.920
Just sat around
that glowing bubble,

01:32:05.040 --> 01:32:07.509
drunk on our own magic,
staring at it like...

01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:11.119
I don't know, like it was
the baby Jesus playing Mozart.

01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:18.159
After 13 and a half hours,
the glass cracked, and I knew it.

01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:22.712
The world would never
be the same.

01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:25.874
I'm working
on something now,

01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:27.758
something so new that...

01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:32.750
People will forget my name
was ever associated with electricity.

01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:35.112
I wonder if you know
what it is yet.

01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:43.357
You know,
I think the solution is

01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:46.230
to divide the cost
of the fence.

01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:51.592
Or you could not build
a fence at all.

01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:56.631
Your garden would be
twice as big.

01:32:57.360 --> 01:32:59.079
Wouldn't it, Tom?

01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:08.274
If nothing else,
a pleasure.

01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:12.638
Enjoy the fair, George.

01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:18.800
Mr. Edison.

01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:32.840
<i>We build monuments
to speak to the future,</i>

01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:34.474
<i>to say we were here,</i>

01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:37.195
<i>we have lived.</i>

01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:42.912
<i>Our true legacy isn't what
we build up to the heavens</i>

01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:45.236
<i>or carve deep into stone.</i>

01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:47.359
<i>Rocks will crumble,</i>

01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:49.633
<i>paper disintegrates,</i>

01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:52.273
<i>and bone turns to powder.</i>

01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:57.158
Only that which isn't
in the physical realm

01:33:57.240 --> 01:33:59.994
and reaches in both directions
can be eternal.

01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:02.870
Our ideas.

01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:07.037
They are what
we leave behind.

01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:11.399
And only they are what
can push us forward.
