WEBVTT

00:00.734 --> 00:03.071
MM-HMM. MM-HMM.

00:05.073 --> 00:07.575
THIS PLACE IS A MESS.

00:07.575 --> 00:10.311
IT'S LIKE I'M A KID AGAIN,
LIVING WITH YOU, MOM.

00:10.311 --> 00:12.313
MY HOUSE NEVER
LOOKED LIKE THIS.

00:12.313 --> 00:14.182
RIGHT.
IF THIS WERE YOUR HOUSE,

00:14.182 --> 00:16.350
THERE'D BE BEER CANS
AND CIGARETTE BUTTS EVERYWHERE

00:16.350 --> 00:18.352
AND A SAD LITTLE MEXICAN KID
LEARNING HOW TO JUGGLE

00:18.352 --> 00:20.354
SO HE COULD RUN AWAY
TO THE CIRCUS

00:20.354 --> 00:22.723
TO HAVE A NORMAL CHILDHOOD.
I'D BE LIKE THAT...

00:29.597 --> 00:31.832
I WAS GONNA CLEAN IT UP,
BUT I'M SWAMPED WITH WORK.

00:31.832 --> 00:34.602
I JUST BOOKED ANOTHER WEDDING
AND A QUINCEAÃ‘ERA.

00:34.602 --> 00:36.003
SO YOU CAN'T COOK,

00:36.003 --> 00:39.607
YOU DON'T CLEAN AND YOU WON'T
DISCIPLINE YOUR KIDS--

00:39.607 --> 00:40.774
MOM!

00:40.774 --> 00:44.445
I'M JUST TRYING TO SEE
WHAT THE ATTRACTION IS.

00:44.445 --> 00:47.448
GEORGE, IF MY BUSINESS
KEEPS EXPANDING LIKE THIS,

00:47.448 --> 00:49.983
I'M NEVER GONNA HAVE TIME
TO CLEAN THE HOUSE.

00:49.983 --> 00:52.153
OKAY, I'LL HANDLE THIS.

00:52.153 --> 00:55.989
MAX! CLEAN THE HOUSE!

00:55.989 --> 00:59.127
HE HAS HOMEWORK TO DO.

00:59.127 --> 01:00.661
WELL, WHY ELSE
DID WE HAVE HIM?

01:00.661 --> 01:02.863
IT'S NOT LIKE HE'S UPSTAIRS
INVENTING A CAR

01:02.863 --> 01:05.566
THAT RUNS ON WATER OR A PENCIL
THAT'S ALSO A CHURRO--

01:05.566 --> 01:07.568
WAIT A MINUTE.
THAT IS BRILLIANT.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.770
HOW MUCH DO WE HAVE
IN THE SAVINGS?

01:09.770 --> 01:11.071
NO!

01:11.071 --> 01:12.673
HI, GUYS.

01:12.673 --> 01:16.510
HEY. AY, DIOSMÃ­O,
THIS KITCHEN IS A DISASTER.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.546
(teeth clenched)
I TOLD YOU.

01:18.546 --> 01:20.781
ANGIE,
YOU NEED A MAID.

01:20.781 --> 01:22.150
NO. NO MAIDS.

01:22.150 --> 01:24.318
I DON'T WANT SOME STRANGER
IN MY HOUSE

01:24.318 --> 01:26.620
GOING THROUGH MY STUFF,
INVADING MY PRIVACY.

01:26.620 --> 01:29.123
GEORGE, WE HAD A MAID
GROWING UP, AND IT WAS GREAT.

01:29.123 --> 01:31.125
YEAH, THEY ARE LIKE
PART OF YOUR FAMILY.

01:31.125 --> 01:33.927
WELL, EXCEPT THEY HAVE TO
DO WHAT YOU SAY,

01:33.927 --> 01:35.429
AND THEY LEAVE AT NIGHT.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.431
THOUGH NEVER CALL THEM
AT HOME.

01:37.431 --> 01:38.732
OH, MAN, YOU'LL JUST HEAR

01:38.732 --> 01:40.934
GUNSHOTS AND SIRENS
IN THE BACKGROUND.

01:40.934 --> 01:43.604
AND THE--IT'S DEPRESSING.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.606
WELL, I REMEMBER
WHEN I WAS A KID,

01:45.606 --> 01:47.608
SEEING ALL THE LATINOS
AT THE BUS STOP

01:47.608 --> 01:49.610
WAITING TO GO CLEAN
SOME RICH GUY'S HOUSE.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.745
I DON'T WANNA BE
THAT GUY.

01:51.745 --> 01:53.747
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT,
UNCLE GEORGE.

01:53.747 --> 01:56.750
I LOVED OUR MAID RITA.
SHE WAS THE HARDEST WORKER EVER.

01:56.750 --> 01:59.687
YOU COULDN'T EVEN DISTRACT HER.
I'D SAY, "RITA!"

01:59.687 --> 02:02.423
AND SHE WOULD
KEEP ON WORKING.

02:02.423 --> 02:07.027
I THOUGHT HER NAME
WAS VICKY.

02:07.027 --> 02:08.529
OH, MY GOD!

02:08.529 --> 02:13.267
THAT'S WHY SHE NEVER
TURNED AROUND!

02:13.267 --> 02:16.704
I REALLY MISS
RITA-VICKY.

02:16.704 --> 02:18.739
COME ON, VERONICA,
I'LL TAKE YOU TO DINNER.

02:18.739 --> 02:21.442
I WAS THINKING OF MAKING
PAELLA FOR YOU HERE,

02:21.442 --> 02:24.645
BUT SOMETHING IN THAT OLD BOWL
OF RICE JUST BLINKED AT ME.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.214
LET'S GO!

02:29.750 --> 02:32.052
GEORGE, IT WOULD ONLY BE
ONE DAY A WEEK.

02:32.052 --> 02:35.055
AND IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE FORCING THEM TO WORK.

02:35.055 --> 02:38.058
WHAT IS WRONG WITH GIVING
A NICE LATINA A JOB?

02:38.058 --> 02:40.060
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I AGREE, ANGIE.

02:40.060 --> 02:42.296
WHEN CAN YOU START?

02:42.296 --> 02:47.568
SENORA, THE DISHES,
POR FAVOR, RÃ¡PIDO! RÃ¡PIDO!

02:47.568 --> 02:49.570
I TOLD YOU,
I AM TOO BUSY.

02:49.570 --> 02:52.440
YOU KNOW, UNLESS YOU WANNA CLEAN
THE HOUSE, WE NEED A MAID.

02:52.440 --> 02:54.442
ALL RIGHT, FINE,
I'LL DO IT.

02:54.442 --> 02:56.744
I MEAN,
HOW MUCH CAN THERE BE?

02:56.744 --> 02:59.813
DO THE LAUNDRY,
DUST THE HOUSE,

02:59.813 --> 03:01.882
VACUUM THE LIVING ROOM,
MOP THE KITCHEN FLOORS,

03:01.882 --> 03:03.884
CLEAN MAX'S BATHROOM.
I DON'T KNOW WHY

03:03.884 --> 03:05.719
YOU'RE GIVING ME
A HARD TIME ON THIS, ANGIE.

03:05.719 --> 03:08.856
I WORK HARD FOR A LIVING.
GET OFF MY BACK. WE NEED A MAID!

03:10.624 --> 03:14.262
THANK YOU, CHEYENNE,
WE'LL GIVE YOU A CALL.

03:18.732 --> 03:21.369
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I LIKE HER.

03:21.369 --> 03:24.171
SHE HAS NO EXPERIENCE.

03:24.171 --> 03:26.440
SHE HAS NO EXPERIENCE?
DID YOU SEE THAT TONGUE STUD?

03:26.440 --> 03:28.642
SHE'S GOT EXPERIENCE!

03:28.642 --> 03:30.444
NOT AS A MAID.

03:30.444 --> 03:32.112
NOT AS A MAID, BUT YOU
HIRE HER, AND SHE LEARNS.

03:32.112 --> 03:34.682
SHE'S LIKE THAT...

03:37.050 --> 03:39.353
(knock on door)

03:39.353 --> 03:41.822
I'LL HANDLE THIS ONE.

03:44.858 --> 03:48.028
HI, ANGIE.

03:48.028 --> 03:50.764
HI, GEORGE.

03:50.764 --> 03:53.267
RUTH,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

03:53.267 --> 03:55.869
HONEY,
YOU REMEMBER RUTH?
FROM THE BAKERY?
HELL, YEAH!

03:55.869 --> 04:01.074
FROM CHURCH.
PEACE BE WITH YOU,
SISTER.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.443
HERE, HAVE A SEAT.

04:02.443 --> 04:03.844
SO, RUTH,

04:03.844 --> 04:06.547
DID YOU COME HERE
ABOUT THE CLEANING JOB?

04:06.547 --> 04:08.549
WELL, I SAW ON
THE BULLETIN BOARD THAT YOU

04:08.549 --> 04:10.318
WERE LOOKING
FOR HELP ONE DAY A WEEK,

04:10.318 --> 04:12.553
AND I NEED SOMETHING
TO KEEP ME BUSY.

04:12.553 --> 04:15.989
WELL, HONEY, HAVING RUTH HERE
WOULD BE MUCH BETTER

04:15.989 --> 04:17.858
THAN SOME STRANGER.

04:20.628 --> 04:22.796
NO OFFENSE, RUTH,
BUT THE PERSON WE HIRE

04:22.796 --> 04:25.299
HAS TO DO SOME
PRETTY TOUGH WORK AROUND HERE.

04:25.299 --> 04:28.101
OH, I RAISED THREE BOYS.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.837
I CAN HANDLE ANYTHING.

04:29.837 --> 04:31.839
AND AS A LITTLE BIT
OF A BRIBE,

04:31.839 --> 04:34.007
I BROUGHT YOU
SOME MUFFINS.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.509
WELL,
NO OFFENSE, RUTH,

04:35.509 --> 04:38.479
BUT I'M NOT MAKING ANY DECISIONS
BASED ON A MUFFIN.

04:38.479 --> 04:42.182
IT'S A BIG DEAL FOR ME
TO BRING SOMEONE INTO MY HOUSE.

04:42.182 --> 04:45.185
OHH.
THERE'S PUDDING IN THE MIDDLE!

04:45.185 --> 04:46.754
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

04:47.988 --> 04:50.724
YOU START TOMORROW.
SENORA, YOU'RE FIRED.

04:52.326 --> 04:55.463
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

04:58.499 --> 05:01.669
* ALL MY FRIENDS

05:01.669 --> 05:03.070
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

05:15.015 --> 05:17.551
AFTER YOU FINISH THE LAUNDRY,
CAN YOU DO THE LIVING ROOM?

05:17.551 --> 05:19.420
OH, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT A THING, ANGIE.

05:19.420 --> 05:22.490
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.
OKAY. OH, I'M MAKING A LIST
FOR RUTH.

05:22.490 --> 05:25.493
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE?
UH, NO, I GOT IT.

05:25.493 --> 05:28.529
HONEY, SHE WORKS HERE NOW.
WHAT IS IT?

05:28.529 --> 05:30.664
I DON'T WANNA SAY IT
IN FRONT OF HER, ANGIE.

05:30.664 --> 05:33.901
IT'S PRIVATE.
OH, HE NEEDS
HIS UNDERWEAR WASHED.

05:33.901 --> 05:35.803
HEY!

05:35.803 --> 05:37.438
WELL, DO YOU?

05:37.438 --> 05:41.174
YEAH, REAL BAD.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.176
I'M RUNNING LATE FOR MY MEETING.
RUTH, YOU HAVE MY CELL.

05:43.176 --> 05:48.549
GEORGE, IF YOU NEED
ANYTHING, PLEASE TELL RUTH.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.317
I'M NOT GONNA BE
IN YOUR WAY HERE, AM I?

05:50.317 --> 05:53.454
NO, IT'S YOUR HOUSE.
DO WHATEVER YOU NORMALLY WOULD.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.288
(sniffs)

05:55.288 --> 05:57.658
OH, HERE YOU GO.

05:57.658 --> 06:00.528
ARE YOU FEELING
ALL RIGHT?

06:00.528 --> 06:02.996
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
JUST FIGHTING A COLD.

06:02.996 --> 06:04.532
OH.

06:04.532 --> 06:05.866
YOU FEEL
A LITTLE WARM.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.001
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU
SOME CHICKEN SOUP.

06:08.001 --> 06:09.437
REALLY?

06:09.437 --> 06:11.439
WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY SAY--

06:11.439 --> 06:13.941
CHICKEN SOUP
IS A MOTHER'S PENICILLIN.

06:13.941 --> 06:15.943
WHEN I WAS A KID,
MY MOM'S PENICILLIN WAS,

06:15.943 --> 06:18.278
"HEY, FATHEAD,
WALK IT OFF!"

06:18.278 --> 06:21.281
I'LL BET YOU'RE GETTING SICK
BECAUSE YOU'RE WORKING TOO HARD.

06:21.281 --> 06:23.784
YEAH, WELL, I HAVE PUT IN
A LOT OF HOURS TRYING TO BREAK

06:23.784 --> 06:26.053
TO PRODUCTIVITY RECORD
AT THE PLANT.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.188
DID YOU DO IT?

06:28.188 --> 06:31.024
YEAH, I DID.

06:31.024 --> 06:32.660
GOOD FOR YOU!

06:32.660 --> 06:35.796
OH, THAT'S FANTASTIC NEWS!

06:35.796 --> 06:38.398
YOU KNOW... (chuckles)

06:38.398 --> 06:40.400
THEY GAVE ME
A CERTIFICATE.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.202
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL
OR ANYTHING.

06:42.202 --> 06:44.204
I MEAN, IN THE WHOLE HISTORY
OF THE COMPANY,

06:44.204 --> 06:47.274
THEY'VE ONLY GIVEN OUT TWO,
AND THE LETTERS ARE IN GOLD.

06:47.274 --> 06:49.743
YOU WANNA SEE IT?

06:51.111 --> 06:52.412
(gasps)

06:52.412 --> 06:55.483
OH, WOULD YOU LOOK
AT THAT?

06:55.483 --> 06:58.952
THIS IS GOING ON
THE FRIDGE, MISTER!

06:58.952 --> 07:01.455
NO WAY! MY MOM NEVER PUT
ANYTHING ON THE FRIDGE

07:01.455 --> 07:03.591
UNLESS
IT WAS EMBARRASSING.

07:03.591 --> 07:05.192
OH, THAT'S HORRIBLE.

07:05.192 --> 07:06.760
I KNOW, HUH?

07:06.760 --> 07:09.763
I GOT AN "F" ON A TEST,
AND SHE PUT IT ON THE FRIDGE.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.264
SO I GOT HER BACK.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.467
I FOUND A LETTER TO HER
FROM THE FREE CLINIC,

07:13.467 --> 07:14.768
AND I PUT IT UP.

07:14.768 --> 07:16.604
THAT WAY,
WE BOTH FAILED A TEST.

07:16.604 --> 07:19.607
WELL, THIS IS
AN ACCOMPLISHMENT,

07:19.607 --> 07:22.009
AND IT NEEDS TO BE
SHOWN OFF.

07:22.009 --> 07:24.211
PUT IT OVER
MAX'S HISTORY TEST.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.913
HE ONLY GOT A "B."

07:25.913 --> 07:29.817
OH,
I WISH I HAD A CAMERA

07:29.817 --> 07:32.820
SO I COULD TAKE A PICTURE
OF YOU WITH YOUR CERTIFICATE.

07:32.820 --> 07:35.789
I GOT A CAMERA
OVER HERE!

07:39.893 --> 07:44.197
OKAY, SMILE!

07:44.197 --> 07:46.900
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

07:46.900 --> 07:48.435
NOTHING.
THIS IS RUTH.

07:48.435 --> 07:50.504
I-I'M DOING SOME CLEANING
FOR GEORGE AND ANGIE.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.606
OH, YOU'RE THE HELP.
GIMME A BEER.

07:52.606 --> 07:55.375
DON'T LISTEN
TO HER, RUTH.

07:55.375 --> 07:57.878
THIS IS MY MOM. YOU MIGHT'VE
HEARD OF HER AT CHURCH.

07:57.878 --> 07:59.580
AFTER
HER LAST CONFESSION,

07:59.580 --> 08:01.381
THEY FOUND FATHER JOHN
IN THE SHOWER SCREAMING,

08:01.381 --> 08:05.018
(Irish accent) "I CAN'T
GET CLEAN! I CAN'T GET CLEAN!"

08:05.018 --> 08:06.554
NICE TO MEET YOU.

08:06.554 --> 08:08.589
WELL, THE LAUNDRY
CAN WAIT.

08:08.589 --> 08:11.592
I THINK I'LL JUST RUN DOWN
TO THE MARKET

08:11.592 --> 08:14.261
AND GET WHAT I NEED
TO MAKE MY CHICKEN SOUP.

08:14.261 --> 08:18.832
AND, YOU--
YOU REST YOURSELF, MISTER.

08:22.770 --> 08:25.773
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

08:25.773 --> 08:27.908
SHE WAS JUST BEING
NICE TO ME.

08:27.908 --> 08:31.011
SHE EVEN TOUCHED MY HEAD BECAUSE
SHE THOUGHT I HAD A FEVER.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.881
YOU NEVER DID THAT.
WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE SICK.

08:33.881 --> 08:35.916
LET ME FEEL.
NO FEVER.

08:35.916 --> 08:38.118
BUT YOU DO HAVE
A LITTLE RED MARK.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.753
WHERE?
HERE!

08:41.221 --> 08:44.558
RUTH, IT HIT ME!

08:48.896 --> 08:51.331
(electric clippers buzzing)

08:51.331 --> 08:52.733
THERE.

08:52.733 --> 08:55.703
AGAIN, AGAIN!

08:55.703 --> 08:57.805
I THINK
I GOT IT ALL.

08:57.805 --> 08:59.807
I KNOW,
BUT IT JUST FEELS GOOD.

08:59.807 --> 09:02.910
(electric clippers buzzing)

09:02.910 --> 09:05.045
(giggling)

09:05.045 --> 09:07.547
OKAY, ALL DONE.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.983
NOW YOU SEE,
THAT WASN'T SO BAD, WAS IT?

09:09.983 --> 09:12.720
YOU SAID IF I SAT STILL,
I'D GET A SURPRISE.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.788
YES, I DID,
AND IT'S IN THE KITCHEN.

09:14.788 --> 09:18.058
WHEN YOU TOLD ME
YOU'D NEVER HAD A BIRTHDAY CAKE

09:18.058 --> 09:20.260
WHEN YOU WERE A KID,
IT JUST BROKE MY HEART.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.062
SO TO MAKE UP FOR THAT,

09:22.062 --> 09:25.032
I BAKED YOU A CAKE
FROM SCRATCH.

09:25.032 --> 09:27.467
WHAT DOES
"FROM SCRATCH" MEAN?

09:27.467 --> 09:32.873
IT MEANS I MADE IT
WITH MY OWN HANDS JUST FOR YOU.

09:32.873 --> 09:35.876
AND THERE IS
ONE SPECIAL INGREDIENT.

09:35.876 --> 09:38.211
LOVE?

09:38.211 --> 09:40.247
UH, CINNAMON.

09:42.049 --> 09:47.220
OH, OH, BUT SURE, SURE,
THERE'S LOVE IN THERE SOMEWHERE.

09:47.220 --> 09:49.422
MY BOYS USED TO LOVE
TO ICE THEIR OWN CAKES.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.224
SO HERE, YOU TRY IT.

09:51.224 --> 09:54.194
AND--AND WRITE
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

10:02.670 --> 10:05.806
"THANKS, MOM."

10:05.806 --> 10:08.008
OH, HOW SWEET!

10:12.379 --> 10:14.581
OH, ARE YOU--
ARE YOU GETTING SICK AGAIN?

10:14.581 --> 10:16.583
YOUR EYES ARE ALL WATERY.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.385
NO, IT JUST LOOKS LIKE

10:18.385 --> 10:20.754
THERE'S A LOT OF CINNAMON
IN THAT CAKE,

10:20.754 --> 10:23.791
YOU KNOW,
A LOT OF CINNAMON.

10:23.791 --> 10:25.793
RUTH...

10:25.793 --> 10:27.861
WHAT HAPPENED?
IT'S A MESS IN HERE.

10:27.861 --> 10:31.598
OH, I'M SORRY,
I MEANT TO GET TO IT,

10:31.598 --> 10:34.902
BUT WE HAVE HAD
SUCH A BUSY SATURDAY.

10:34.902 --> 10:38.071
SOMETIMES I WISH
I COULD JUST CROSS MY ARMS,

10:38.071 --> 10:42.309
BLINK MY EYES
AND MAKE THINGS HAPPEN.

10:44.812 --> 10:47.881
"THANKS, MOM."
YOU MADE ME A CAKE?

10:47.881 --> 10:51.852
UH, THAT'S NOT FOR YOU.

10:51.852 --> 10:55.756
GEORGE, CAN I SPEAK TO YOU
IN THE LIVING ROOM?
BUT CAN WE MAKE IT QUICK?

10:55.756 --> 10:57.825
'CAUSE RUTH IS TAKING ME
TO THE MOVIES,

10:57.825 --> 10:59.827
AND SHE SAID I COULD
PICK THE CANDY.

10:59.827 --> 11:02.029
I'M GONNA PICK THE ONES
THAT LOOK LIKE WORMS

11:02.029 --> 11:05.198
AND AFTER YOU EAT THEM,
YOU'RE LIKE THAT...

11:09.703 --> 11:11.872
SO, UM...

11:11.872 --> 11:14.742
I D--I DIDN'T SEE YOU
AT CHURCH LAST SUNDAY.

11:14.742 --> 11:17.745
BECAUSE MY SATURDAY NIGHT
WAS STILL GOING

11:17.745 --> 11:19.847
ON SUNDAY MORNING.

11:22.349 --> 11:27.120
HIS NAME IS CHUCK.
HOW MUCH CAN YOU HANDLE?

11:27.120 --> 11:30.157
WELL, I WOULD SAY
SAVE IT FOR CONFESSION

11:30.157 --> 11:33.894
BUT... WE CAN'T AFFORD
TO LOSE ANOTHER PRIEST.

11:36.663 --> 11:39.666
LOOK, I KNOW
YOU REALLY LIKE RUTH,

11:39.666 --> 11:42.702
BUT I THINK SHE'D RATHER
CODDLE YOU THAN DO THE WORK.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.872
(scoffs) NEGATIVE.

11:46.974 --> 11:48.942
IT'S BEEN TWO WEEKS
AND I'VE TALKED TO HER,

11:48.942 --> 11:53.346
BUT THE HOUSE IS STILL A MESS!
WE NEED TO LET HER GO.
NO. NO WAY.

11:53.346 --> 11:55.816
SHE'S NOT DOING THE JOB
WE'RE PAYING HER TO DO.

11:55.816 --> 11:57.951
I KNOW
WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

11:57.951 --> 12:01.154
YOU CAN'T STAND IT THAT SOMEONE
LIKES ME MORE THAN YOU.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.489
SICK.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.960
SAINT ANGIE IS FINALLY
OFF HER THRONE.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.996
SAINTS DON'T HAVE THRONES.

12:08.996 --> 12:11.031
YEAH, THAT'S NICE,
CORRECT EVERYONE YOU RUN INTO.

12:11.031 --> 12:13.967
THAT'LL MAKE YOU MORE FRIENDS.

12:13.967 --> 12:16.436
I JUST WANT
A CLEAN HOUSE!

12:16.436 --> 12:19.439
AND IF RUTH CAN'T DO THE WORK,
WE'LL HAVE TO GET SOMEONE ELSE.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.775
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHEN I GET BACK FROM MY MEETING,

12:21.775 --> 12:23.576
I'LL TELL HER
IT'S NOT WORKING OUT.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.613
NO, YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HER.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

12:26.613 --> 12:28.448
I KNOW I HAVE
A LOT OF WORK,

12:28.448 --> 12:31.284
BUT I THOUGHT YOU TWO
MIGHT LIKE A PIECE OF CAKE.

12:31.284 --> 12:33.520
HERE'S ONE FOR YOU
AND ONE FOR YOU.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.790
AH HA HA,
MINE'S BIGGER.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.591
THANK YOU, RUTH.

12:38.591 --> 12:41.328
GEORGE, WAS THERE SOMETHING YOU
WANTED TO TALK TO RUTH ABOUT?

12:42.562 --> 12:47.868
(muffled) RUTH...
THIS ISN'T WORKING OUT.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.536
WHAT?

12:52.840 --> 12:54.875
(muffled)
IT'S JUST NOT WORKING OUT.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.077
OH...

12:57.077 --> 13:00.013
OH, SWEETIE, I'LL GET YOU
A GLASS OF MILK.

13:05.685 --> 13:09.022
(muffled) I TRIED TO TELL HER,
ANGIE. YOU SAW ME.

13:17.865 --> 13:19.867
ANGIE'S GONNA BE HOME
ANY MINUTE.

13:19.867 --> 13:21.869
WHAT DO WE HAVE LEFT?
THE FLOORS!

13:21.869 --> 13:24.872
GO FOR IT!
ALL RIGHT...

13:24.872 --> 13:26.874
HEY, I DON'T GET THIS.

13:26.874 --> 13:28.876
JUST BECAUSE
YOUR CLEANING WOMAN IS NICE,

13:28.876 --> 13:31.344
YOU'RE GONNA DO
ALL HER WORK FOR HER?

13:31.344 --> 13:33.346
HEY, MAN,
IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

13:33.346 --> 13:36.850
YOU KNOW, SHE COOKS FOR ME.
SHE MAKES SURE I'M FEELING OKAY.

13:36.850 --> 13:39.552
YOU KNOW, SHE CARES.
SHE SOUNDS MORE LIKE A MOM
THAN A MAID.

13:39.552 --> 13:43.590
HUH. OH, WE'RE GETTING INTO
YOUR WEIRD AREA, AREN'T WE?

13:45.859 --> 13:48.028
DAD, DID RUTH DO
THE LAUNDRY?

13:48.028 --> 13:50.130
UH, SHE'S WORKING ON IT.
IT'S IN THE WASHER.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.065
BUT I NEED A SHIRT
FOR TONIGHT.

13:52.065 --> 13:54.701
I'M GOING TO THE MOVIES
WITH LAURA ORTIZ.

13:54.701 --> 13:57.604
HEY, ERNIE, GET ME A LEMON,
CUT IT IN HALF.
IT'LL DIRTY A KNIFE!

13:57.604 --> 13:59.572
I'M MAKING A CALL.

13:59.572 --> 14:01.341
ARMS UP! ARMS UP!

14:01.341 --> 14:05.278
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
HEY!

14:05.278 --> 14:07.114
I'M DRY CLEANING
THE LOPEZ WAY.

14:07.114 --> 14:09.116
THERE, YOU'RE ALL
LEMONY FRESH.

14:09.116 --> 14:11.985
NOW JUST A WARNING--IF YOU HUG
HER AND SHE'S GOT A CUT,

14:11.985 --> 14:13.420
SHE'S GONNA SCREAM.

14:15.222 --> 14:16.523
(gasps)

14:16.523 --> 14:18.025
GEORGE, GEORGE, GEORGE!

14:18.025 --> 14:20.427
WE ONLY HAVE TIME
FOR ONE GEORGE. WHAT IS IT?!

14:20.427 --> 14:23.096
ANGIE JUST DROVE UP
BUT WE HAVEN'T DONE THE TABLE.

14:23.096 --> 14:25.899
DO IT.
OKAY.

14:39.146 --> 14:43.050
EVENING, MA'AM.
EVENING... SIR.

14:44.684 --> 14:48.355
THIS PLACE LOOKS FANTASTIC.

14:48.355 --> 14:50.157
IT'S SPOTLESS.

14:50.157 --> 14:52.125
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I DECIDED NOT TO FIRE RUTH.

14:52.125 --> 14:54.194
I WANTED TO GIVE HER
ONE MORE SHOT.

14:54.194 --> 14:56.796
WHAT, YOU JUST TALKED TO HER
AND SHE DID ALL THIS?

14:56.796 --> 14:58.565
ANGIE, I'M A MANAGER.
I GOT A LOOK

14:58.565 --> 15:01.434
THAT CAN GET PEOPLE TO DO
WHAT THEY DON'T WANNA DO.

15:03.136 --> 15:05.138
WELL, HOW COME I'VE NEVER
SEEN THE LOOK?

15:05.138 --> 15:07.140
YOU GOT A RING
ON YOUR FINGER, DON'T YOU?

15:07.140 --> 15:09.342
YOU'VE SEEN THE LOOK.

15:11.111 --> 15:14.081
MOM, DAD, SOMEONE STOLE MONEY
FROM MY ROOM.

15:14.081 --> 15:15.548
(Angie) WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

15:15.548 --> 15:17.550
LAST CHRISTMAS
GRANDMA GAVE ME A $50 BILL.

15:17.550 --> 15:20.553
AND I WAS GONNA USE IT TO TAKE
LAURA ORTIZ TO THE MOVIES,

15:20.553 --> 15:23.190
BUT NOW I CAN'T FIND IT.
I THINK RUTH TOOK IT.

15:23.190 --> 15:25.425
HOLD ON A SECOND,

15:25.425 --> 15:27.560
BEFORE WE START
CALLING PEOPLE THIEVES--

15:27.560 --> 15:28.928
YOU GAVE HIM $50?

15:28.928 --> 15:31.764
YOU NEVER GAVE ME THAT KIND
OF MONEY WHEN I WAS A KID.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.266
OH, YOU DIDN'T NEED IT.

15:33.266 --> 15:36.469
YOU COULD NEVER PULL A GIRL
LIKE LAURA ORTIZ.

15:36.469 --> 15:40.173
IF THAT WOMAN IS STEALING,
I WOULDN'T WANT HER IN MY HOUSE.

15:40.173 --> 15:42.809
WHY DON'T I
JUST CALL RUTH

15:42.809 --> 15:44.611
AND GIVE HER
A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN?

15:44.611 --> 15:47.280
MAYBE SHE MOVED THE MONEY
WHEN SHE WAS CLEANING.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.517
IN THE MEANTIME, WE SHOULD
DOUBLE-CHECK YOUR ROOM. COME ON.

15:52.352 --> 15:55.788
WHAT?

15:55.788 --> 15:58.325
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THIS, WOULD YOU, MOM?

15:58.325 --> 16:02.562
GEORGE, PLEASE, NOW I WOULD
NEVER STEAL FROM MY GRANDSON.

16:02.562 --> 16:05.165
WHAT KIND OF A MONSTER
DO YOU THINK I AM?

16:05.165 --> 16:08.368
SOME KIND OF HALF-WOMAN,
HALF-BAT..

16:08.368 --> 16:10.337
THAT FEEDS ON
CHILDREN'S DREAMS.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.339
YOU CAN FLY,
BUT EVERY TIME YOU DO,

16:12.339 --> 16:15.142
YOU BECOME
A LITTLE BIT SHORTER.

16:15.142 --> 16:17.877
THAT'S WHY YOU ONLY DO IT
IN EMERGENCIES.

16:17.877 --> 16:19.446
YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:19.446 --> 16:22.849
I HAVE BEEN COMING TO THIS HOUSE
EVERY DAY SINCE CHRISTMAS,

16:22.849 --> 16:24.651
AND THE MONEY
HAS ALWAYS BEEN HERE.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.786
RUTH'S BEEN HERE A COUPLE
OF WEEKS, THE MONEY'S GONE!

16:26.786 --> 16:28.988
YOU DO THE MATH.
YOU'LL PROBABLY GET IT WRONG,

16:28.988 --> 16:32.159
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT YOU TRY.

16:32.159 --> 16:34.327
OH, LOOK AT THAT,
NO ONE STOLE IT.

16:34.327 --> 16:37.297
IT'S ON THE FLOOR.
MAX MUST'VE DROPPED IT.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.266
AHA!

16:39.266 --> 16:41.968
YOU CHECKED YOUR BRA!
SO?

16:41.968 --> 16:44.571
YOU TOOK THE MONEY AND YOU HID
IT IN THERE. I KNEW IT.

16:44.571 --> 16:48.108
OH, I DIDN'T HIDE ANYTHING.
THE GIRLS JUST NEEDED SOME AIR.

16:49.509 --> 16:53.413
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN GIRLS
FOR 40 YEARS.

16:54.781 --> 16:56.383
YOU KNOW, GEORGE,

16:56.383 --> 16:58.451
YOU'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO
BELIEVE ME ABOUT THE MONEY

16:58.451 --> 17:01.421
BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE
ANOTHER CHOICE.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.490
ALL RIGHT.

17:03.490 --> 17:05.225
HERE WE GO...

17:07.127 --> 17:08.495
OH, WHAT'S THE KNIFE FOR?

17:08.495 --> 17:10.497
IF I'M WRONG
AND THERE'S NO $50 IN THERE,

17:10.497 --> 17:14.534
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
STAB MY EYES OUT.

17:19.272 --> 17:21.074
WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:21.074 --> 17:24.911
MY MOM STOLE MAX'S MONEY.
WHY YOU TRYING TO FRAME RUTH?

17:24.911 --> 17:27.380
I WASN'T TRYING
TO FRAME HER.

17:27.380 --> 17:31.218
I'M--I'M IN TROUBLE, SEE?

17:31.218 --> 17:33.086
I-I OWE A GUY MONEY.

17:33.086 --> 17:34.887
HIS NAME IS... MIKE.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.889
MIKE ROWAVE,

17:36.889 --> 17:38.758
BECAUSE, UH,
HE HEATS UP FAST.

17:38.758 --> 17:41.761
AND HE HAS GOT
A PRETTY MEAN ENFORCER NAMED...

17:41.761 --> 17:43.463
JIMMY THE...

17:43.463 --> 17:44.697
DISH RACK!

17:46.799 --> 17:48.501
(knock on door)

17:50.570 --> 17:52.572
OH, I AM SO SORRY.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.541
I DON'T REMEMBER
SEEING ANY MONEY.

17:54.541 --> 17:57.577
I-I HOPE YOU DON'T THINK
I HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.779
MOM, APOLOGIZE,
APOLOGIZE.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.581
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

18:02.982 --> 18:05.918
I'M SORRY THAT YOU'VE GOT
NOTHING IN YOUR LIFE,

18:05.918 --> 18:08.588
SO TO MAKE UP FOR IT,

18:08.588 --> 18:11.658
YOU'RE TRYING TO STEAL
OTHER PEOPLE'S KIDS.

18:11.658 --> 18:12.959
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

18:12.959 --> 18:17.130
I-I WASN'T TRYING
TO STEAL GEORGE.

18:17.130 --> 18:19.132
ARE YOU JEALOUS
OF RUTH?

18:19.132 --> 18:20.767
NO.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.969
I JUST THINK IT'S STRANGE
TO COME IN HERE

18:22.969 --> 18:24.771
AND SEE YOU
HUGGING MY SON.

18:24.771 --> 18:27.240
WHY SHOULD THAT BOTHER YOU?
YOU NEVER HUGGED ME.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.642
I HUGGED YOU PLENTY.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.478
YEAH?

18:31.478 --> 18:33.480
WHAT,
WHEN YOU WERE DRUNK

18:33.480 --> 18:35.482
AND YOU COULDN'T STAND UP
ON YOUR OWN?

18:35.482 --> 18:37.484
OR THAT TIME
IN THE GROCERY STORE

18:37.484 --> 18:39.486
WHERE YOU HUGGED ME
BUT WHEN YOU PULLED BACK

18:39.486 --> 18:41.488
THERE WAS A STEAK
IN MY SHIRT?

18:41.488 --> 18:43.356
AND YOU SAID, "BE COOL,
BE COOL, BE COOL,

18:43.356 --> 18:46.693
I'LL MEET YOU AT THE CAR"?
AND YOU BLEW THAT ONE.

18:46.693 --> 18:48.695
HOW MANY 6 YEAR OLDS
CAN BE COOL

18:48.695 --> 18:50.897
WITH COW BLOOD
RUNNING DOWN THEIR LEGS?

18:50.897 --> 18:53.933
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
YOU GOT THE $50. I'M OUTTA HERE.

18:53.933 --> 18:57.170
HEY, IF YOU'RE JEALOUS
OF SOMEONE ELSE BEING MY MOM,

18:57.170 --> 18:59.172
THEN STEP UP,
GIVE ME A HUG.
WHY?

18:59.172 --> 19:01.174
I DON'T NEED
TO PROVE ANYTHING.

19:01.174 --> 19:02.675
I WASN'T A BAD MOM.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.377
YOU REMEMBER THAT
ONE CHRISTMAS

19:04.377 --> 19:06.646
I GAVE YOU A COUPON
FOR A HUG.

19:06.646 --> 19:10.650
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
WANNA BUY ME A GIFT.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.652
AND THEN I WENT
TO GET THE HUG,

19:12.652 --> 19:15.688
AND YOU SAID THE COUPON
EXPIRED THE DAY BEFORE.

19:15.688 --> 19:17.490
WHY AM I EVEN HERE?

19:17.490 --> 19:19.659
YOU DON'T APPRECIATE
ANYTHING I DO FOR YOU.

19:19.659 --> 19:22.229
FINE, IF YOU DON'T WANNA
GIVE ME A HUG,

19:22.229 --> 19:23.963
I KNOW SOMEONE WHO WILL.

19:23.963 --> 19:26.032
MM-HMM, I LOVE YOU.
HUH, YOU LIKE THAT?

19:26.032 --> 19:30.370
HOW DOES THAT
MAKE YOU FEEL?
WEIRD AND UNCOMFORTABLE.

19:32.205 --> 19:34.173
GEORGE,
LET GO OF RUTH.
NO.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.742
GEORGE!

19:35.742 --> 19:37.677
(Ruth) LOOK...

19:37.677 --> 19:39.646
I WAS JUST TRYING TO MAKE
A LITTLE EXTRA MONEY.

19:39.646 --> 19:41.648
BUT I'M SURE
THE GENERIC HEART MEDICINE

19:41.648 --> 19:44.617
WILL WORK JUST AS WELL
AS WHAT I'M USING.

19:44.617 --> 19:47.019
WHERE YOU GOING,
NEW MOTHER?

19:47.019 --> 19:49.021
I AM SO SORRY
ABOUT THIS.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.690
WE'LL SEE YOU
AT CHURCH, HUH?

19:50.690 --> 19:52.892
WELL, ACTUALLY, I THINK
I'LL BE TRANSFERRING

19:52.892 --> 19:54.561
TO A NEW CHURCH...

19:54.561 --> 19:57.430
ONE THAT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT
AND CAN'T FIND.

19:59.732 --> 20:01.801
ARE YOU HAPPY
YOU GOT RID OF RUTH?

20:01.801 --> 20:03.336
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE...

20:03.336 --> 20:05.305
YOU WANT A HUG?
WILL THAT END THIS?

20:05.305 --> 20:07.974
YEAH, IT WOULD,
BUT YOU'LL NEVER DO IT.
WELL, YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.842
I DO KNOW THAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT? JUST FORGET IT.

20:09.842 --> 20:13.112
ALL RIGHT, FINE. I'M GONNA
PROVE TO YOU THAT I CAN DO THIS.

20:13.112 --> 20:14.781
LET'S JUST
GET IT OVER WITH.

20:14.781 --> 20:15.982
JUST CLOSE YOUR EYES

20:15.982 --> 20:18.885
SO I DON'T HAVE TO SEE
THAT NEEDY LITTLE FACE.

20:26.793 --> 20:29.729
IS SHE GONE?

20:29.729 --> 20:30.663
NO.

20:30.663 --> 20:34.701
SHE'S JUST ABOUT TO HUG YOU.

20:38.971 --> 20:40.373
YOU SMELL GOOD, MOM.

20:40.373 --> 20:43.543
EW! I CAN'T DO THIS!

20:54.186 --> 20:55.988
YOU READY FOR WORK?

20:55.988 --> 20:57.690
YEAH. LET'S GO.

21:12.372 --> 21:14.307
I'LL MEET YOU
AT THE CAR, MOM.

21:18.010 --> 21:20.413
OH, QUELA,
I DIDN'T SAVE IT!

21:21.448 --> 21:31.491
ONE MORE TIME, MOM!
ONE MORE TIME!
