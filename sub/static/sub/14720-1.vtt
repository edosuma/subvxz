maybe they'd let you out a bit.

will be repercussions.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.840
It's the usual suspects.

08:44.960 --> 08:47.960

call them civilized.

Great to see you again, Rita.

09:36.600 --> 09:37.680

09:37.800 --> 09:39.040
I hope you were
good while I was away.

09:39.160 --> 09:39.960
Always.

09:43.320 --> 09:45.880
God, it must've been so awful.

It's good to be back, Ngaire.

09:55.880 --> 09:56.720
Lefty.

09:56.840 --> 09:58.080
So how was women's prison?

10:01.000 --> 10:04.120
You boys have been inside,so you know the deal.

10:04.240 --> 10:05.360
You do what you have to.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.240
When what happens
there, stays there.

10:07.360 --> 10:08.640
And we'll get the barbie on.

10:08.760 --> 10:09.720
Let you ladies catch up.

10:12.720 --> 10:14.160
Spend it carefully, boys.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.240
This is all there is.

10:15.360 --> 10:16.240
Yeah.

10:16.360 --> 10:17.400
Lasted us pretty good, this job.

10:17.520 --> 10:19.840
I thought diamonds
were forever.

10:19.960 --> 10:21.400
The yappy jeweler
was the last job

10:21.520 --> 10:23.760
we did before Rita went inside.

10:23.880 --> 10:26.360
Now she's back and
all the money's gone.

10:26.480 --> 10:28.280
Isn't that how it
always works with woman?

10:28.400 --> 10:31.840
I hear Desiree's also
a cabin attendant now.

10:31.960 --> 10:34.600
She's only domestic
for now, but the pilots

10:34.720 --> 10:36.320
are love here is what I hear.

10:36.440 --> 10:39.360
So no movement on
the baby front then.

10:39.480 --> 10:42.200
No.

10:42.320 --> 10:44.000
Ngaire thinks that
because I've had

10:44.120 --> 10:49.360
so many lovers that, you know,I might have ruined myself.

10:49.480 --> 10:50.760
I'm sure that's not the case.

10:50.880 --> 10:53.000
Well, I don't know.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.400
Children aren't everything, ay.

11:01.120 --> 11:03.440
It's not right without Wolf.

11:03.560 --> 11:05.680
Speak for yourself,
your doing all right.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.960
Because I have a skill.

11:08.080 --> 11:12.560
I have heaps of skills,just not at making money.

11:12.680 --> 11:13.480
Oh, I shouldn't.

11:13.600 --> 11:14.600
It makes me weird.

11:14.720 --> 11:15.840
Nah, it makes you normal.

11:15.960 --> 11:17.320
[laughs]

11:17.440 --> 11:18.960
But even though I'm makingplentiful dollars doing

11:19.080 --> 11:21.840
my business with Mr.Bert, I would much rather

11:21.960 --> 11:24.920
be doing burgs with my friends.

11:25.040 --> 11:26.680
And resting my
head inbetween Mrs.

Mm, I hear you brother.

11:31.440 --> 11:34.960
[laughs]

11:35.080 --> 11:36.200
I don't care.

11:36.320 --> 11:37.680
If Lonnie steals the
cars [inaudible]..

11:37.800 --> 11:39.360
I shop the cars out West.

11:39.480 --> 11:40.640
its all money to me.

11:40.760 --> 11:42.520
- But they're Jap crap cars.- I don't care.

11:42.640 --> 11:44.760
The Japanese rupee and
the New Zealand dollar,

11:44.880 --> 11:46.000
all the same to me.

11:46.120 --> 11:47.000
And he's a [inaudible]

11:47.120 --> 11:47.920
I still don't care.

11:52.280 --> 11:53.560
Hey, I gotta shoot through.

11:53.680 --> 11:54.800
A date.

11:54.920 --> 11:56.880
Then I'm off to
Sydney for a week.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.160
Glamorous life
of menswear, ay.

11:59.280 --> 12:00.120
Something like that.

12:00.240 --> 12:01.040
Fair enough.

12:01.160 --> 12:02.840
Thanks for stopping by.

12:02.960 --> 12:04.640
It's good to see Rita back.

12:04.760 --> 12:05.880
Yeah.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.960
Is she OK with the
way it played out?

12:08.080 --> 12:09.240
No.

12:09.360 --> 12:11.800
She'll get used to it.

12:11.920 --> 12:12.880
No.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.760
No she won't.

12:14.880 --> 12:16.320
It'll nag away at her until--

12:19.760 --> 12:21.120
--until something fucking gives.

12:21.240 --> 12:22.200
[music - the crocodile, "tears"]

12:22.320 --> 12:24.160
[SINGING] Tears.

12:24.280 --> 12:26.600
I feel them on my cheeks.

12:26.720 --> 12:29.040
Tears.

12:29.160 --> 12:31.480
I've been this way for weeks.

12:31.600 --> 12:36.360
Tears I'm back
here at the start.

12:36.480 --> 12:37.320
Tears.

Wait, wait.

12:51.960 --> 12:53.040
[horn honking]

12:53.160 --> 12:55.000
[SINGING] I went
along, it slipped

12:55.120 --> 12:57.240
my mind to check the price.

13:02.360 --> 13:04.720
Tears.

13:04.840 --> 13:06.720
I feel them on my cheeks.

13:06.840 --> 13:08.440
What do you think
Wolf is doing right now?

13:08.560 --> 13:11.920
[SINGING] I've been
this way for weeks.

13:12.040 --> 13:14.400

13:14.520 --> 13:16.520
I'm back here at the start.

[men barking]

13:35.840 --> 13:39.200
The Queen has returned.

13:39.320 --> 13:40.560
I wouldn't go that far.

13:40.680 --> 13:41.480
I would.

13:46.480 --> 13:47.960
It's almost exactly
as you left it.

13:51.040 --> 13:54.880
[gun shots]

13:55.000 --> 13:56.320
So I see.

13:56.440 --> 13:58.040
Yeah, sorry.

13:58.160 --> 14:00.280
I tried everything I couldthink of to get that out.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.880
Surprised they didn't burnthe bloody place to the ground.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.520
Yeah, it was my
thought exactly, which

14:04.640 --> 14:07.040
is why I moved in to defend it.

14:09.880 --> 14:11.480
That was very
brave of you, Eric.

14:11.600 --> 14:12.920
It turned out they
were happy when

14:13.040 --> 14:14.640
I gave them all the moneyfrom the careless days

14:14.760 --> 14:15.720
exemption stickers.

14:15.840 --> 14:17.280
Sorry you had to do that.

14:17.400 --> 14:19.920
It didn't really matter
'cause [inaudible]..

Trying to explain you're notresponsible for government

14:26.120 --> 14:27.800
not ideal.

14:27.920 --> 14:29.680
So they took my son, instead.

14:29.800 --> 14:31.320
Yeah.

14:31.440 --> 14:33.800
Sorry about that.

14:33.920 --> 14:35.080
Why are sorry?

14:35.200 --> 14:37.000
It's his decision;
nothing to do with you.

14:43.560 --> 14:45.800
This is for you.

14:45.920 --> 14:46.920
What is it?

14:47.040 --> 14:48.560
The profits, I
suppose you'd say,

14:48.680 --> 14:50.920
from while you were inside.

14:51.040 --> 14:53.000
I wish that it could havebeen more but, quite frankly,

14:53.120 --> 14:56.440
business has been shit.

14:56.560 --> 14:57.320
Thank you.

15:04.960 --> 15:06.560
Five seconds and
then we're even.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.800
And that's five.

15:12.920 --> 15:13.720
Heads up.

15:17.800 --> 15:19.160
Ted.

15:19.280 --> 15:20.520
Phineas.

15:20.640 --> 15:22.200
Gold Bullion by a nose.

15:22.320 --> 15:23.840
Told you I know
how to pick 'em.

15:23.960 --> 15:25.680
You're machine, Mr. McCarthy.

15:25.800 --> 15:28.080
You're misses is back.

15:28.200 --> 15:30.640
She must be slotted
to hear about Wolf.

15:30.760 --> 15:33.480
Stand staunch, doing
his time for them.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.840
Only to get out to find he'ssucking cock for the Horseman.

15:36.960 --> 15:37.960
Wolf's not like that.

15:38.080 --> 15:39.720
It was an expression, Phineas.

15:39.840 --> 15:40.680
Not a very nice one.

15:40.800 --> 15:42.120
It's OK, Phineas.

15:42.240 --> 15:43.680
We all know if Wolf wantedto suck cock he would've

15:43.800 --> 15:46.480
joined the police force.

15:46.600 --> 15:49.000
Very nice, Ted.

15:49.120 --> 15:50.640
But do you really
think Rita will find

15:50.760 --> 15:52.160
it that amusing when
she realizes she's

15:52.280 --> 15:54.120
wasted a year of her life?

15:54.240 --> 15:56.440
Because your boy is
going away anyway.

15:56.560 --> 15:57.520
They all are.

15:57.640 --> 15:58.880
The whole mangy lot of 'em.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.720
Do you want to
place a bet or not?

16:00.840 --> 16:02.040
Sure.

16:02.160 --> 16:04.040
I'll tell you what,
I bet within a month,

16:04.160 --> 16:06.520
young Wolf is enjoying
the hospitality

16:06.640 --> 16:09.640
of the majesties hotel.

16:09.760 --> 16:41.360
[dramatic music]

16:41.480 --> 17:13.600
[rock music]

17:20.800 --> 17:22.080
You spotted me.

17:22.200 --> 17:23.800
You're driving
a red fucking van.

17:23.920 --> 17:25.280
It wasn't hard.

17:25.400 --> 17:27.280
What do you want?

17:27.400 --> 17:28.440
What happened to you?

17:28.560 --> 17:29.320
Nothing.

17:29.440 --> 17:30.680
What do you want?

17:30.800 --> 17:33.200
Well, for starters,
your mother's going

17:33.320 --> 17:35.120
quietly insane without you.

17:35.240 --> 17:37.600
My mother never
does anything quietly.

17:37.720 --> 17:38.760
Yeah, that is true.

17:38.880 --> 17:40.320
And after our last
visit, Buck made

17:40.440 --> 17:42.120
it pretty clear that if Ileave the repercussions will

17:42.240 --> 17:43.560
go back on her.

17:43.680 --> 17:44.560
So if you're here sosave me you can piss off.

17:44.680 --> 17:47.760
There's a snitch in the gang.

17:47.880 --> 17:49.320
How do you know this?

17:49.440 --> 17:52.520
Because McCarthy
likes to talk.

17:52.640 --> 17:56.640
And whatever the next job is,he's going to be there waiting.

17:56.760 --> 17:59.040
And you're going to be
the first one arrested.

17:59.160 --> 18:01.800
Because that's what
happens to prospects.

18:01.920 --> 18:03.360
They take the fall
for the cowards

18:03.480 --> 18:06.200
that aren't man enough tostand up for themselves.

18:06.320 --> 18:07.560
So what am I meant
to do about it?

18:07.680 --> 18:08.800
Get in my red fucking van.

18:08.920 --> 18:10.280
Come with me, now.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.680
Was I not clear
enough just before?

18:12.800 --> 18:14.280
About what happens if leave.

18:14.400 --> 18:15.960
Whatever those pricks throwat us, we can deal with it.

18:16.080 --> 18:16.920
OK.
- How?

18:17.040 --> 18:19.040
By throwing Phineas at them?

18:19.160 --> 18:20.440
You're out of your
league with these guys.

18:20.560 --> 18:22.040
They have guns.
They have numbers.

18:22.160 --> 18:23.680
They will eat you alive.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.640
And the only thing stoppingthem is me being a part of 'em.

18:25.760 --> 18:26.880
So drive away.
Forget about me.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.600
No.
That's not gonna happen.

18:28.720 --> 18:29.520
OK.

18:29.640 --> 18:30.720
So get in my van, now.

18:30.840 --> 18:31.960
Dad, that never
worked when I was a kid.

18:32.080 --> 18:33.560
What makes you think
it's gonna work now?

18:33.680 --> 18:35.400
Because I'm trying to saveyour life, you little shit.

18:35.520 --> 18:36.480
And I'm trying to say yours.

18:36.600 --> 18:37.880
Don't you get it?

18:38.000 --> 18:39.240
You think I like it in there.

18:39.360 --> 18:41.480
You think I want to be
one of their bum boys.

18:41.600 --> 18:44.080
That's just what has to happen.

18:44.200 --> 18:45.800
And as for the snitch, dad,there's always a snitch.

18:45.920 --> 18:47.400
You know that.

18:47.520 --> 18:50.480
And If I end up in
prison, so be it.

18:50.600 --> 18:51.960
Can't be any worse
than what it is now.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.720
And after what mom did for me.

18:57.840 --> 18:58.960
This is what I
have to do for her.

19:07.000 --> 19:27.720
[melancholy guitar]

19:27.840 --> 19:30.080
Pie is really good.

19:30.200 --> 19:30.960
Thanks, Sparky.

19:37.920 --> 19:41.200
Spoke to Wolf today.

19:41.320 --> 19:43.120
How?

19:43.240 --> 19:46.320
You know kinda
ran into each other.

19:46.440 --> 19:49.360
First thing is, he's all
right, he's surviving.

19:49.480 --> 19:50.280
And the second thing?

19:53.040 --> 19:54.720
We're getting
him out of there.

19:54.840 --> 19:58.440
Whether he bloody
wants it or not.

19:58.560 --> 20:00.000
I don't know how
yet, but we will.

20:12.520 --> 20:14.000
You're here early.

20:14.120 --> 20:16.240
Come to open up, But
you've beat me to it.

20:16.360 --> 20:18.040
What's in the box?

20:18.160 --> 20:20.200
A few knick-knacks I'm
giving to a friend.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.720
Not store knick-knacks.

20:21.840 --> 20:22.640
Really?

20:22.760 --> 20:23.840
Really.

20:23.960 --> 20:24.840
You don't need to
concern with this.

20:34.520 --> 20:35.280
Eric.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.440
These are not
knick-knacks, Eric.

20:43.560 --> 20:45.680
Gosh, really?
Good to know.

20:45.800 --> 20:47.000
I'll just get them
out of your hair.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.080
Do you know anything
at all about Clarice

20:49.200 --> 20:50.400
Cliff, Susie Cooper?

20:53.600 --> 20:55.080
I know that they
make cups and stuff.

20:55.200 --> 20:56.120
And they are rare.

20:56.240 --> 20:58.320
And so they're valuable.

20:58.440 --> 21:02.040
And so how the fuck have yougot a whole box full of them?

21:02.160 --> 21:05.960
Well, it helps if
you know where to look.

21:06.080 --> 21:07.680
Are you stealing
these to order?

21:07.800 --> 21:09.000
No.

21:09.120 --> 21:10.920
I just get a list of
descriptions and stuff,

21:11.040 --> 21:11.840
and addresses.

21:11.960 --> 21:13.160
Who from?

21:13.280 --> 21:14.320
You. don't want to know.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.440
Yep, I do.

21:15.560 --> 21:17.120
Really it's
better if you don't.

21:17.240 --> 21:19.120
And also if you could go awayfor about half an hour or so.

21:19.240 --> 21:20.360
That'd be good.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.080
Oh, shit.

21:22.200 --> 21:26.440
Eric, what are you--

21:26.560 --> 21:28.680
Because this is
my fucking store.

21:28.800 --> 21:32.120
And unless you want to end upon the ground again, squealing,

21:32.240 --> 21:34.040
you can fuck right
off out of it.

21:34.160 --> 21:35.440
With pleasure.

21:35.560 --> 21:36.800
As soon as I get
what I came for.

21:40.400 --> 21:43.160
You want this.

21:43.280 --> 21:46.520
What kind of girly gangcollects art deco ceramics?

21:46.640 --> 21:47.840
Look just give me the box.
OK.

21:47.960 --> 21:48.720
No.

21:48.840 --> 21:49.920
Not OK.

21:50.040 --> 21:51.200
No, no, no.

21:51.320 --> 21:52.120
Whoa.

21:52.240 --> 21:53.440
Get out of my store, now.

21:56.120 --> 21:59.440
You have no idea what
you've just done.

21:59.560 --> 22:02.800
Fucking greedy,bitch.

22:02.920 --> 22:04.440
The thing that
confuses me most

22:04.560 --> 22:06.840
is sometimes she
flies to these places

22:06.960 --> 22:09.080
that I've never even heard of.

22:09.200 --> 22:11.840
Well, you should
get yourself an Atlas.

22:11.960 --> 22:14.000
What's a stove
got to do with this?

22:14.120 --> 22:16.000
What I'm saying is if I triedto take the box from her ahe

22:16.120 --> 22:18.440
woulda smashed the whole lot.

22:18.560 --> 22:20.360
I'm telling you I
had no other choice.

22:25.920 --> 22:26.680
Baby?

22:26.800 --> 22:29.120
Carol?

22:29.240 --> 22:32.040
Phineas, don't
even think about it.

22:32.160 --> 22:33.120
Phinease.

22:33.240 --> 22:34.600
Hey, we have a peace now.

22:34.720 --> 22:35.720
Maybe you do.

22:35.840 --> 22:36.680
Oh, shit.

22:36.800 --> 22:37.600
Fuck.

22:37.720 --> 22:39.080
Phineas.

22:39.200 --> 22:40.800
Phineas.

22:40.920 --> 22:42.320
Phin.

22:42.440 --> 22:43.200
Phin.

22:50.520 --> 22:52.440
Phineas, hey, you can't
do this shit anymore.

22:52.560 --> 22:53.360
OK.

22:53.480 --> 22:54.240
We have a truce now.

22:54.360 --> 22:55.160
I don't.

22:55.280 --> 22:56.480
Not with them.

22:56.600 --> 22:58.680
Not until that bastard
gets what he deserves.

23:03.280 --> 23:05.360
- Good on Phineas, I say.- No.

23:05.480 --> 23:07.480
Not good on, Phineas.

23:07.600 --> 23:09.880
This is a delicate
political situation.

23:10.000 --> 23:13.040
Which means not only is itOK for them to have our son,

23:13.160 --> 23:16.800
but they can also terrorize Ericinto stealing pottery for them.

23:16.920 --> 23:18.320
I can't help you there
'cause I have no idea

23:18.440 --> 23:19.240
what the hell that's about.

23:19.360 --> 23:21.200
[banging]

23:21.320 --> 23:23.480
We were both here last nightwatching Mortimer's Patch.

23:23.600 --> 23:25.400
I know, Ted, because we were.

23:25.520 --> 23:26.280
Right.

23:29.600 --> 23:30.840
The fuck is going on, Ted.

23:30.960 --> 23:32.520
I thought we had a deal.

23:32.640 --> 23:34.200
Yeah, we do.

23:34.320 --> 23:37.600
Why is your boy going aroundbeating the shit out of my boy?

23:37.720 --> 23:39.680
We had a truce.

23:39.800 --> 23:41.120
Phineas is a force of nature.

23:41.240 --> 23:42.600
A lunatic is what he is.

23:42.720 --> 23:44.120
Tell you what.

23:44.240 --> 23:46.840
You let Wolf go and
I'll deal to Phineas.

23:46.960 --> 23:48.880
I didn't get
your problem, Rita.

23:49.000 --> 23:55.200
Our Wolf, he's a good
boy, smart, reliable.

23:55.320 --> 23:57.080
He'll go a long way with us.

23:57.200 --> 23:59.680
My problem is that he'snot home with his family.

23:59.800 --> 24:03.120
His choice, his idea to
make everything good.

24:03.240 --> 24:04.680
Saved it didn't, did it.

24:04.800 --> 24:06.800
Thinks to Ted's
bloody Maori mate.

24:06.920 --> 24:07.920
Phineas is black Irish.

24:08.040 --> 24:08.920
He's not Maori.

24:09.040 --> 24:10.040
Is that actually a real thing.

24:10.160 --> 24:11.560
Apparently.

24:11.680 --> 24:14.320
I'm talking about yougetting Eric to steal pottery.

24:14.440 --> 24:15.680
Whatever the hell
that's all about.

24:15.800 --> 24:17.520
I'm staying well
clear of that.

24:17.640 --> 24:18.800
But it was your guy.

24:18.920 --> 24:20.760
But nothing to do with me.

24:20.880 --> 24:23.000
And it would be
helpful for all of us

24:23.120 --> 24:25.480
if you just handed
the stuff over.

24:25.600 --> 24:28.000
For the next
Horseman tea party.

24:28.120 --> 24:30.440
It's a complex situation.

24:30.560 --> 24:32.720
I can pay you if that helps.

24:32.840 --> 24:33.680
Not at all.

24:33.800 --> 24:34.600
Rita.

24:43.160 --> 24:45.880
What are we going
to do about your guy?

24:46.000 --> 24:46.880
No much I can do.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.000
Come on, Ted.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.520
We're on the same side, mate.

24:49.640 --> 24:52.200
Yeah, I don't know ifPhineas sees it that way.

24:52.320 --> 24:54.880
You know, after you
broke Carol's jaw.

24:55.000 --> 24:55.800
OK.

24:55.920 --> 24:57.080
That was no good.

24:57.200 --> 24:58.280
I admit.

24:58.400 --> 24:59.640
But in all fairness,
she had just

24:59.760 --> 25:01.160
glassed Cannonball in the face.

25:01.280 --> 25:04.920
Because Cannonball
was breaking Phin's leg.

25:05.040 --> 25:06.600
They had on both sides then.

25:06.720 --> 25:08.960
Mainly yours.

25:09.080 --> 25:11.200
All right.

25:11.320 --> 25:16.920
What can we do to makethings right, here and now.

25:17.040 --> 25:20.080
Letting Phineas have ago at your boy Cannonball.

25:20.200 --> 25:21.280
It might be a good
place to start.

25:29.600 --> 25:32.800
Did you have a good chat?

25:32.920 --> 25:35.720
Had a bloody
useful chat actually.

25:35.840 --> 25:39.440
Best mates again, are you?

25:39.560 --> 25:41.240
Hey, I'll never bemates with those bastards

25:41.360 --> 25:44.480
as long as I live.

25:44.600 --> 25:47.960
If what we talked
about plays out.

25:48.080 --> 25:51.360
You and me could be onestep closer to what we want.

25:51.480 --> 25:52.760
How?

25:52.880 --> 25:56.800
By you not making mattersworse, for starters.

25:56.920 --> 25:58.800
Let the men sort it out?

25:58.920 --> 26:00.560
Yes.

26:00.680 --> 26:03.040
Can you manage that?

26:03.160 --> 26:06.280
Probably not.

26:06.400 --> 26:08.800
Lying back and taking itisn't really my style, in case

26:08.920 --> 26:10.600
you hadn't noticed.
- Oh, I had noticed.

26:15.120 --> 26:20.440
But I can play nice fora while, if you it'll help.

26:24.280 --> 26:25.600
I'm not [inaudible]

26:25.720 --> 26:27.000
What's not to get?

26:27.120 --> 26:28.560
You and this guy
Cannonball get to sort

26:28.680 --> 26:30.000
things out, once and
for all, by getting

26:30.120 --> 26:30.960
into the ring and boxing.

26:31.080 --> 26:32.320
- I get that bit.
- OK.

26:32.440 --> 26:33.920
Then what bit don't you get?

26:34.040 --> 26:35.320
The bit where you say thefight is at this gym they have.

26:35.440 --> 26:36.840
Yeah, so.

26:36.960 --> 26:38.320
So all the Horse
pricks will be there.

26:38.440 --> 26:39.320
Yep.

26:39.440 --> 26:40.640
And we will all be there, too.

26:40.760 --> 26:41.960
Exactly.

26:42.080 --> 26:43.680
What if we turn up
and it's a trap.

26:43.800 --> 26:45.400
He actually has a point there.

26:45.520 --> 26:46.320
It's not a trap.

26:46.440 --> 26:47.600
How do you know?

26:47.720 --> 26:49.280
Because Buck assured
me that it isn't.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.440
That's the sort of thing yousay to lure people into traps.

26:51.560 --> 26:52.600
Jesus, Phin.

26:52.720 --> 26:53.560
Do you want to fight
the guy or not?

26:53.680 --> 26:55.040
Hell yeah.

26:55.160 --> 26:56.240
I want to kick his nutsthrough the top of his head.

26:56.360 --> 26:57.160
No.

26:57.280 --> 26:58.080
No.

26:58.200 --> 26:58.960
You can't do that.

26:59.080 --> 27:00.520
It's boxing, Phineas.

27:00.640 --> 27:01.960
In a boxing ring.

27:02.080 --> 27:03.760
- With gloves on.
- And rules.

27:03.880 --> 27:05.000
The Marquise of
Queensberry rules.

27:05.120 --> 27:07.600
Lefty, don't confuse him.

27:07.720 --> 27:09.640
Are you in or not?

27:09.760 --> 27:11.000
Sure.

27:11.120 --> 27:13.680
But I can still pound
him to a pulp, right?

27:13.800 --> 27:14.760
That's the spirit.

27:14.880 --> 27:16.520
A fucking boxing match?

27:16.640 --> 27:18.080
Yes.

27:18.200 --> 27:19.760
What's wrong with it?

27:19.880 --> 27:22.240
How does Phineas getting hisrocks off beating up this dick

27:22.360 --> 27:24.400
head, help to get Wolf back?

27:24.520 --> 27:26.760
Sorts out the Phineas problem.

27:26.880 --> 27:28.480
So.

27:28.600 --> 27:31.600
So with that sorted,then we're on to a better

27:31.720 --> 27:32.560
footing with these guys.

27:32.680 --> 27:33.680
And we can move on to Wolf.

27:36.760 --> 27:38.560
Jesus, Rita, it's a long game.

27:38.680 --> 27:39.440
OK.

27:39.560 --> 27:40.480
You need to face that.

27:45.600 --> 27:51.920
Look, I know it's hard for yougetting out to all of this.

27:52.040 --> 27:54.680
But it's going to
work out, all right.

27:54.800 --> 27:55.600
Trust me.

28:12.240 --> 28:14.640
You have something of mine.

28:14.760 --> 28:15.920
Pardon.

28:16.040 --> 28:18.480
Something that belongs to me.

28:18.600 --> 28:20.320
I assure you
everything for sale

28:20.440 --> 28:22.360
has been bought and
paid for above board.

28:22.480 --> 28:23.240
[laughs]

28:23.360 --> 28:24.760
I very much doubt that.

28:24.880 --> 28:26.080
If you think anything
is yours, you

28:26.200 --> 28:27.600
can take it up with the police.

28:27.720 --> 28:31.320
I'm sure it
won't come to that.

28:31.440 --> 28:33.840
Figure it out, Mrs. West.

28:42.320 --> 28:45.280
You wouldn't, by chance, bea collector of Clarice Cliff,

28:45.400 --> 28:46.720
would you?

28:46.840 --> 28:47.960
I appreciate the bizarre.

28:48.080 --> 28:48.840
Yes.

28:48.960 --> 28:50.600
Don't we all.

28:50.720 --> 28:52.520
Sorry I don't know your name.

28:52.640 --> 28:54.120
They're all Buckman.

28:54.240 --> 28:55.320
My married name.

28:55.440 --> 28:56.240
I hate it.

28:56.360 --> 28:57.840
So change your husband.

28:57.960 --> 29:01.960
I mean, [inaudible],, but Iremained wed to his legacy.

29:02.080 --> 29:03.040
Through your son.

29:03.160 --> 29:06.040
Arnie Yes.

29:06.160 --> 29:07.560
He's a good boy.

29:07.680 --> 29:09.520
Most of the time.

29:09.640 --> 29:11.640
I've met your son, too.

29:11.760 --> 29:13.480
He seemed like a good boy.

29:13.600 --> 29:14.880
He is.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.000
Well, now that
we know each other.

29:17.120 --> 29:19.640
Could I have my things, please.

29:19.760 --> 29:22.840
The things that Eric
stole for you, you mean.

29:22.960 --> 29:24.480
I really didn't have a choice.

29:24.600 --> 29:26.320
I offered to buy them
and they said no.

29:26.440 --> 29:27.920
So what else am I meant to do?

29:28.040 --> 29:29.640
Forget about them and move on.

29:29.760 --> 29:32.040
That's not really my style.

29:32.160 --> 29:34.080
No.

29:34.200 --> 29:36.360
I imagine it's not.

29:36.480 --> 29:38.200
Now you have them.

29:38.320 --> 29:40.480
I do.

29:40.600 --> 29:46.440
So what will it takefor you to hand them over?

29:46.560 --> 29:52.240
[music playing]

29:52.360 --> 29:53.640
I fight better
when I'm pissed.

29:53.760 --> 29:54.600
Not tonight.

29:54.720 --> 29:55.920
I'll take that.

29:56.040 --> 29:57.840
Normally, I get quite
excited when Phineas

29:57.960 --> 29:59.440
fights, but not tonight.

29:59.560 --> 30:01.040
I know what you mean.

30:01.160 --> 30:04.160
I'm kind of turned on, too,but I'm so scared, you know.

30:04.280 --> 30:05.520
Don't worry, Mrs. Rita.

30:05.640 --> 30:07.080
We will have your
back all the way.

30:07.200 --> 30:08.200
Thank you, Falani.

30:08.320 --> 30:09.560
Do I have to go?

30:09.680 --> 30:11.480
No, Sparky, of course not.

30:11.600 --> 30:12.760
Yes he does.

30:12.880 --> 30:14.160
For our boy, Wolf.

30:14.280 --> 30:16.000
Otherwise, he is pussy.

30:16.120 --> 30:19.800
I'll leave you boys
to sort that out.

30:19.920 --> 30:21.480
Ted, I just need
word before we go.

30:21.600 --> 30:22.920
Yeah.

30:23.040 --> 30:27.120
Remember, duck and weave,keep those feet moving.

30:27.240 --> 30:29.040
I was just gonna stand
there and smack him.

30:29.160 --> 30:30.000
Well, that could also work.

30:34.120 --> 30:37.280
I have one thing thatI need you to do tonight.

30:37.400 --> 30:38.200
Sure.

30:38.320 --> 30:39.280
Fire away.

30:39.400 --> 30:42.520
Tell Phineas he has to lose.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.160
I'm sorry?

30:44.280 --> 30:47.440
You need to make sure Phineasloses the fight, if you want

30:47.560 --> 30:50.280
our son to come home that is.

30:50.400 --> 30:52.480
Rita, that's probably
not going to happen.

30:52.600 --> 30:53.720
It has to.

30:53.840 --> 30:55.240
So I can fulfill my
part of the deal.

30:55.360 --> 30:56.680
What deal?

30:56.800 --> 31:00.640
The deal that means thatthis isn't a long game.

31:00.760 --> 31:02.280
It's not my
intention to disrespect

31:02.400 --> 31:04.040
your husband or his club.

31:04.160 --> 31:06.240
I just don't see my
son's future there.

31:06.360 --> 31:08.880
And my understanding thatWolf chose to become a prospect.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.360
For the wrong reason.

31:10.480 --> 31:12.400
And it's wrong to stop a war.

31:12.520 --> 31:14.920
Just because it's noble
doesn't make it right.

31:15.040 --> 31:18.200
So because some old biddygets her bloody teacups back,

31:18.320 --> 31:19.400
they'll let our son go?

31:19.520 --> 31:20.720
Jesus, Ted.

31:20.840 --> 31:22.120
Have you still not
figured out where

31:22.240 --> 31:23.880
true power lies in the world?

31:24.000 --> 31:24.960
Clearly not.

31:25.080 --> 31:25.840
You'll see.

31:28.520 --> 31:31.840
So if you've made this deal.

31:31.960 --> 31:33.480
Why does Phin need
to take a dive?

31:33.600 --> 31:37.720
The thing is, all theboys are like sons to me,

31:37.840 --> 31:39.560
even Cannonball.

31:39.680 --> 31:40.720
I can say that.

31:40.840 --> 31:42.080
I know he's not
the brightest bulb.

31:42.200 --> 31:45.200
But with his facial
disfigurement and all,

31:45.320 --> 31:47.320
plus being shot in the gut.

31:47.440 --> 31:51.520
His bowel control is
not what it used to be.

31:51.640 --> 31:52.640
So!

31:52.760 --> 31:54.560
I'm meant to say
to Phineas, mate,

31:54.680 --> 31:56.760
you need to throw the
fight so that Cannonball
