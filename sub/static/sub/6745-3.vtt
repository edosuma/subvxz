What -- what about my side
of the story?

38:04.883 --> 38:06.883
You don't have a side.
You have a choice.

38:06.885 --> 38:11.788
Manslaughter or terrorism?
It's entirely up to you.

38:15.127 --> 38:19.062
Manslaughter. We'll take...

38:19.064 --> 38:20.997
The manslaughter.

38:28.907 --> 38:32.909
<i> The police, they --</i>
<i> they railroaded me.</i>

38:32.911 --> 38:34.844
<i> I told them what they</i>
<i> wanted to hear.</i>

38:34.846 --> 38:36.780
<i> I said I shot bug by accident.</i>
<i> And the cops told me that</i>

38:36.782 --> 38:38.581
<i> that would get me</i>
<i> out of trouble.</i>

38:38.583 --> 38:40.317
<i> And Alice? Bug killed Alice.</i>

38:40.319 --> 38:44.454
<i> Not me. I only said I did it</i>
<i> because the cops told me to.</i>

38:44.456 --> 38:45.955
<i> Okay? And -- and before that,</i>

38:45.957 --> 38:48.224
<i> they talked me</i>
<i> out of an attorney.</i>

38:48.226 --> 38:49.726
<i> That's unfreakin' American.</i>

38:49.728 --> 38:52.529
<i> What they did to me is</i>
<i> so freaking unamerican.</i>

38:52.531 --> 38:53.730
<i> Rusty: And is that all?</i>

38:53.732 --> 38:57.600
[ Video continues indistinctly ]

38:57.602 --> 39:00.470
Y-yeah, this is just another
suspect saying,

39:00.472 --> 39:02.605
"I'm innocent.
I didn't do it."

39:02.607 --> 39:05.475
I find no cause
for sanction here.

39:05.477 --> 39:08.978
Still, kid,
you didn't ask permission

39:08.980 --> 39:10.880
to talk to the defendant,
and that caused

39:10.882 --> 39:12.682
a ridiculous waste
of everyone's time.

39:12.684 --> 39:15.618
Tell me, have you thought
about changing stories?

39:15.620 --> 39:17.220
Moving on
to something else?

39:17.222 --> 39:18.922
No, your honor,
I couldn't do that.

39:18.924 --> 39:20.657
Really? Why?

39:20.659 --> 39:24.761
Well, because Alice --
Jane Doe #38, she needs me.

39:24.763 --> 39:27.364
I-I don't want her
to be cremated

39:27.366 --> 39:28.832
as some anonymous girl

39:28.834 --> 39:31.301
and dumped
in a pile of ashes.

39:31.303 --> 39:34.571
Judge, I assure you that

39:34.573 --> 39:36.840
rusty will be coordinating
all of his research

39:36.842 --> 39:38.875
with the l.A.P.D.
So that it doesn't step

39:38.877 --> 39:41.010
on the people's case
against slider.

39:41.947 --> 39:44.447
Your honor, may I post my video
of slider on my vlog?

39:44.449 --> 39:46.049
No, no, no, you can't prejudice
the jury --

39:46.051 --> 39:47.584
why not?

39:47.586 --> 39:51.321
Yes. Post it.
It's no big deal.

39:51.323 --> 39:54.691
But do not
talk to him again.

39:55.594 --> 39:57.160
Here's all your stuff.

39:57.162 --> 40:01.464
And I look forward to not
seeing you for a long time.

40:01.466 --> 40:03.967
Good night, Mr. Beck, Andrea.

40:03.969 --> 40:05.935
Uh, Sharon, could you stay
for a second?

40:05.937 --> 40:08.505
Thank you, your honor.
Thank you very much.

40:12.210 --> 40:14.043
Smart kid.
[ Door closes ]

40:14.045 --> 40:15.345
Tougher than he looks.

40:15.347 --> 40:17.213
You got your hands full.

40:17.215 --> 40:18.882
And my heart.

40:18.884 --> 40:22.085
Thank you for letting him
continue

40:22.087 --> 40:23.653
with his story about Alice.

40:23.655 --> 40:25.989
Anything that keeps him hanging
out at the p.A.B., right?

40:27.492 --> 40:29.726
Where you can watch
over him?

40:32.431 --> 40:34.697
Have you seen his vlog?

40:34.699 --> 40:38.268
He's working
like a professional.

40:38.270 --> 40:39.602
And so are you.

40:39.604 --> 40:41.738
Just make sure that
his professionalism

40:41.740 --> 40:43.540
doesn't interfere
with yours.

40:43.542 --> 40:45.775
I say that as a friend.

40:45.777 --> 40:48.311
You've helped him
with this story enough,

40:48.313 --> 40:51.481
and maybe
don't watch the vlog.

40:52.684 --> 40:55.051
But what if he identifies
the girl?

40:55.053 --> 40:57.253
Well, then, let it be
a big, big surprise.

40:57.255 --> 40:59.389
In other words...

40:59.391 --> 41:02.959
Stay out of it, mama.

41:02.961 --> 41:04.160
Besides...

41:04.162 --> 41:07.297
Don't you know who
this Alice girl really is?

41:07.299 --> 41:10.166
Bottom line?

41:12.471 --> 41:15.872
The victim.

41:15.874 --> 41:18.541
Exactly.

41:18.543 --> 41:20.510
Here. I'll walk you out.
