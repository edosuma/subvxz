01:18.010 --> 01:21.011
If you want to understand
what I've done,

01:21.013 --> 01:24.022
there are things you must
understand about my daughter.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.015
[people chattering
indistinctly]

01:34.018 --> 01:36.019
<i>In 1927, I was moonlighting</i>

01:36.021 --> 01:40.013
<i>in the Bureau of Normalcy's</i>
<i>American headquarters.</i>

01:40.015 --> 01:43.022
<i>I intercepted a tip that</i>
<i>brought me home to London,</i>

01:44.000 --> 01:46.008
<i>a travelling carnival</i>
<i>of grotesques</i>

01:46.010 --> 01:48.013
<i>featuring a familiar beast.</i>

01:48.015 --> 01:50.009
<i>A beast who, if real,</i>

01:50.011 --> 01:51.020
<i>was linked to a woman</i>

01:51.022 --> 01:54.004
<i>I'd tried to keep secret</i>
<i>from the world.</i>

01:54.006 --> 01:56.008
Tuppence a head, if you will!

01:56.010 --> 01:58.006
[Niles] <i>As for the girl,</i>

01:58.008 --> 02:00.005
<i>I told myself</i>
<i>I would not conjecture</i>

02:00.007 --> 02:02.022
<i>until I could see the beast</i>
<i>with my own eyes.</i>

02:06.008 --> 02:10.014
<i>And yet, she was</i>
<i>at the front of my mind.</i>

02:10.016 --> 02:14.004
-[crowd applauding]
<i>-What violence had</i>
<i>brought her to this place?</i>

02:14.006 --> 02:15.017
<i>What had she been</i>
<i>made to suffer</i>

02:15.019 --> 02:18.022
<i>in the company</i>
<i>of this bawdy, illiterate scum?</i>

02:19.000 --> 02:20.004
[piano music playing]

02:20.006 --> 02:21.019
[crowd laughing]

02:24.022 --> 02:26.013
[crowd applauding]

02:26.015 --> 02:29.017
Misshapes,
mistakes, and misfits,
ladies and gentlemen.

02:29.019 --> 02:32.008
Snows and toes.

02:32.010 --> 02:34.010
[crowd cheering]

02:36.013 --> 02:39.009
But now,
the putrid little primate

02:39.011 --> 02:42.001
that you shelled out
your shekels to see.

02:42.003 --> 02:44.002
And here she comes,

02:44.004 --> 02:45.019
a hideous curiosity

02:45.021 --> 02:49.012
captured deep
in the icy Yukon wilderness,

02:49.014 --> 02:53.013
the Ape-Faced Girl!

02:53.015 --> 02:55.001
[crowd murmuring]

03:03.017 --> 03:06.005
I got something else
long and sweet for ya,

03:06.007 --> 03:07.008
Monkey Girl.

03:07.010 --> 03:09.000
[audience laughing mockingly]

03:10.013 --> 03:13.001
Calm yourselves,
calm yourselves. She's a...

03:13.003 --> 03:16.004
[Niles] <i>It was as cruel</i>
<i>as I had imagined.</i>

03:16.006 --> 03:18.014
<i>And as real as I'd feared.</i>

03:18.016 --> 03:21.008
[ringmaster]
A ferocious monster,

03:21.010 --> 03:25.022
tethered to her deranged mind,

03:26.000 --> 03:29.014
the Ape Girl's gruesome pet!

03:31.002 --> 03:32.015
[Niles] <i>Her beast.</i>

03:32.017 --> 03:34.015
<i>Whether it was a spirit</i>
<i>or a familiar</i>

03:34.017 --> 03:37.000
<i>I have yet to fully understand.</i>

03:37.002 --> 03:39.012
Go on, give us a twirl then.

03:39.014 --> 03:41.003
[Niles] <i>But one thing</i>
<i>was certain.</i>

03:41.005 --> 03:43.022
<i>It belongs to a woman</i>
<i>I had loved</i>

03:44.000 --> 03:46.011
<i>and left a long time ago...</i>

03:46.013 --> 03:48.002
[ringmaster]
Around the other way.

03:48.004 --> 03:50.013
<i>...and apparently,</i>
<i>it hadn't forgotten me, either.</i>

03:50.015 --> 03:52.019
-I said around the other way!
-[whip lashing]

03:52.021 --> 03:54.002
[growls]

03:54.004 --> 03:55.018
You will obey me!

03:57.000 --> 03:58.007
[woman screams]

04:00.000 --> 04:01.014
[growls]

04:02.011 --> 04:04.020
[Niles] No! No!

04:04.022 --> 04:05.018
[whip lashing]

04:05.020 --> 04:08.001
[yelling] Stop this!

04:08.003 --> 04:09.015
[Niles] <i>As for</i>
<i>what happened next...</i>

04:09.017 --> 04:12.018
-[growling]
-[man screaming]

04:13.016 --> 04:15.006
<i>...words fail.</i>

04:17.011 --> 04:19.013
[snarls]

04:25.003 --> 04:27.021
[growling]

04:29.011 --> 04:30.020
[objects clatter]

04:40.003 --> 04:41.019
[creature snoring]

04:57.011 --> 04:59.003
[Dorothy sobbing]

05:28.005 --> 05:30.006
How do you know my mother?

05:35.017 --> 05:36.023
[Niles] <i>Two years later,</i>

05:37.001 --> 05:40.000
<i>she'd barely aged a day.</i>

05:40.002 --> 05:42.020
<i>I had to protect her</i>
<i>from the world,</i>

05:42.022 --> 05:45.007
<i>and the world from her.</i>

05:45.009 --> 05:47.002
<i>So, I turned to a friend.</i>

05:47.004 --> 05:48.013
Hello, Danny.

05:48.015 --> 05:51.012
<i>A young, sentient alleyway</i>
<i>named Danny.</i>

05:51.014 --> 05:55.005
<i>A loving, teleporting refuge</i>
<i>for all people.</i>

06:05.012 --> 06:06.020
[chuckles softly]

06:12.000 --> 06:13.013
[lively piano music playing]

06:15.019 --> 06:18.006
Danny's agreed
to keep you safe...

06:18.008 --> 06:20.001
till you're a little bit older.

06:20.003 --> 06:21.008
And I promise

06:21.010 --> 06:23.019
I'll visit you
as often as I can.

06:23.021 --> 06:25.007
Wait.

06:25.009 --> 06:26.023
You're not coming with me?

06:28.018 --> 06:30.019
I wish I could.

06:31.022 --> 06:33.006
But I have to figure out

06:33.008 --> 06:35.022
how to be the best father
I can be,

06:36.000 --> 06:37.017
for as long as I can be.

06:38.012 --> 06:39.017
I...

06:39.019 --> 06:41.005
[men laughing]

06:43.018 --> 06:47.000
[voice shaking]
I don't want to lose you again.

06:47.002 --> 06:50.016
And that's precisely it,
my dear.

06:52.010 --> 06:53.018
My beautiful...

06:55.022 --> 06:57.009
darling Dorothy.

07:01.010 --> 07:03.006
[Cliff] <i>Yeah, yeah,</i>
<i>real weepy shit.</i>

07:03.008 --> 07:05.000
<i>Bet you cried for weeks.</i>

07:05.002 --> 07:06.007
<i>Not what I asked.</i>

07:06.009 --> 07:08.021
I asked about
why you did what you did.

07:08.023 --> 07:10.003
To us.

07:15.010 --> 07:17.001
I searched the globe

07:17.003 --> 07:19.009
to find a way
to outlive Dorothy

07:20.000 --> 07:21.010
by one day.

07:23.002 --> 07:26.015
My research took me to Paraguay
where Eric Morden

07:26.017 --> 07:29.000
was about to trade
a longevity talisman

07:29.002 --> 07:31.008
to a scientist
in return for superpowers.

07:31.010 --> 07:34.007
[Cliff] So,
you shot up the Nazi lab,
stole the dumb monkey paw

07:34.009 --> 07:35.014
and Morden became Mr. Nobody.

07:35.016 --> 07:37.001
I saw the puppet show!

07:37.003 --> 07:39.010
What about us?

07:39.012 --> 07:42.008
My longevity was limited.

07:42.010 --> 07:46.012
So I began my experiments
in search of true immortality.

07:47.008 --> 07:48.014
Rita,

07:48.016 --> 07:49.022
Larry,

07:50.000 --> 07:51.004
Jane,

07:51.006 --> 07:53.010
and you, Cliff.

07:53.012 --> 07:55.021
But all these years,
the only thing keeping me alive

07:55.023 --> 07:58.011
is the talisman
hanging around my neck.

07:59.008 --> 08:00.020
Until last night...

08:02.020 --> 08:05.012
when I traded it
to Willoughby Kipling

08:05.014 --> 08:09.011
in return for the magical
substance that...

08:09.013 --> 08:11.018
returned us to normal size.

08:11.020 --> 08:14.012
[Cliff] Wait, you gave away
your longevity

08:14.014 --> 08:16.003
like some kind of asshole?

08:17.012 --> 08:20.009
Then, what was all this for?

08:20.011 --> 08:23.006
Don't think the irony
is lost on me.

08:23.008 --> 08:25.014
It was the only way
to make things right,

08:25.016 --> 08:27.009
and now my daughter...

08:28.006 --> 08:29.010
will lose her father.

08:29.012 --> 08:30.017
The one who put her in a cage?

08:30.019 --> 08:32.021
The one who can
make her feel safe.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.016
Without me,

08:34.018 --> 08:37.006
she will unleash hell on Earth

08:37.008 --> 08:40.003
and you will be powerless
to stop it.

08:42.018 --> 08:44.012
Now, Cliff,
you know everything.

08:44.014 --> 08:45.021
[Cliff] Not everything.

08:45.023 --> 08:48.013
Tell me about the night
of my accident.

08:51.005 --> 08:55.004
I want to hear
every fucking detail.

08:57.023 --> 08:59.015
[birds chirping]

09:07.004 --> 09:09.009
[in singsong voice]
Good morning!

09:09.011 --> 09:10.018
Rise and shine!

09:10.020 --> 09:12.015
Our father is dying.

09:12.017 --> 09:14.007
He's dying. [chuckles]

09:14.009 --> 09:15.022
-Ahhh!
-[screams]

09:16.000 --> 09:17.019
[screams]

09:17.021 --> 09:20.010
[panting]

09:20.012 --> 09:24.019
What in the Doris Day Ikea
fuck was that?

09:25.014 --> 09:27.003
Stay out of our room!

09:28.000 --> 09:29.001
[grunts]

09:30.009 --> 09:32.019
[breathing heavily]

09:32.021 --> 09:36.006
What are we still doing here?

09:37.013 --> 09:38.021
Answer me!

09:40.010 --> 09:42.004
[breath trembling]

09:43.012 --> 09:46.022
[stuttering]
I've tried to tell them.

09:51.007 --> 09:55.016
[speaking other language]

09:56.022 --> 09:58.006
[pants]

10:01.000 --> 10:02.012
Oh, not this shit again.

10:11.014 --> 10:14.003
[panting]
You assholes can stay down.

10:14.005 --> 10:15.014
I'm doing just fine.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.016
[Jane] Good morning, Dorothy.

10:34.001 --> 10:36.010
[Rita smacks lips]
Good morning, Jane.

10:36.012 --> 10:37.020
We'll work on her manners.

10:37.022 --> 10:39.018
[Jane] Dorothy.

10:39.020 --> 10:41.000
One of your imaginary friends

10:41.002 --> 10:42.014
stopped by my room
this morning.

10:44.003 --> 10:45.017
Something you wanna
share with us?

10:46.009 --> 10:47.023
It isn't true.

10:48.001 --> 10:48.022
What isn't true?

10:49.000 --> 10:50.009
Why would one of your friends

10:50.011 --> 10:53.002
say it was true if it wasn't?

10:53.004 --> 10:56.013
What is "it"? What was said?

10:56.015 --> 10:59.014
I overheard Dad
and the drunk wizard talking,

10:59.016 --> 11:01.023
but it isn't true.

11:02.001 --> 11:05.006
Oh, for the love of God,
what is or is not true?

11:05.008 --> 11:06.023
-Niles is dying.
-[dishes clatter]

11:07.021 --> 11:08.019
What?

11:08.021 --> 11:10.009
[heavy footsteps approaching]

11:10.011 --> 11:11.013
Cliff!

11:11.015 --> 11:13.011
Did you know
that Niles is dying?

11:13.013 --> 11:15.002
Oh, yeah, karma's a bitch.

11:15.004 --> 11:17.015
-Let that be
a lesson to you, kid.
-[bangs table]

11:17.017 --> 11:19.020
He's not dying!

11:23.011 --> 11:25.000
[Niles] <i>I'm dying.</i>

11:25.002 --> 11:26.010
But we're all dying.

11:27.015 --> 11:29.022
Nothing to fret over.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.019
[Rita] But look at your hair.

11:31.021 --> 11:33.007
It's already started.

11:35.004 --> 11:37.001
How old are you, exactly?

11:38.005 --> 11:39.009
139.

11:39.011 --> 11:40.020
Dear God,
he's practically dead.

11:40.022 --> 11:42.012
[Cliff] Oh, boy,
here come the waterworks.

11:42.014 --> 11:44.018
Vic had the right idea,
getting out of this shitbox.

11:44.020 --> 11:47.006
You're really gonna shed tears
for the man who killed my wife?

11:47.008 --> 11:50.000
You don't have to tell
old Blobberstiltskin here

11:50.002 --> 11:52.007
that Niles Caulder
is a flawed man.

11:52.009 --> 11:54.012
But now,
he is also a dying man.

11:54.014 --> 11:57.001
[sobbing] His teeth
are probably loosening

11:57.003 --> 11:58.016
as we speak.

11:58.018 --> 12:00.010
Soon he'll have no memory of
how to take care of himself

12:00.012 --> 12:02.000
or Dorothy.

12:02.002 --> 12:04.015
We could be mere days
away from daddy diapers.

12:04.017 --> 12:06.002
-Rita!
-[Cliff] Gross.

12:06.004 --> 12:08.000
-I am not changing him.
-[Rita] And why not?

12:08.002 --> 12:09.002
You can't even smell.

12:09.004 --> 12:10.003
I am still here.

12:10.005 --> 12:11.006
[Jane] You know,
she's not wrong.

12:11.008 --> 12:12.015
If Chief croaks,

12:12.017 --> 12:14.018
somebody's gonna have to
take care of the girl.

12:14.020 --> 12:16.015
I'm not letting her go
to that decrepit asylum

12:16.017 --> 12:17.022
with the old Doom Patrol.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.016
Nobody is going back
to that home.

12:19.018 --> 12:22.018
Dorothy was perfectly safe
on Danny for 19 years.

12:22.020 --> 12:23.023
And when Danny grows

12:24.001 --> 12:25.018
into something
other than a brick--

12:25.020 --> 12:27.016
Which could take ages!

12:27.018 --> 12:29.019
And until then,
the only thing keeping Dorothy

12:29.021 --> 12:32.001
from going
full wild child is us.

12:32.003 --> 12:33.015
[Cliff] Us? No way!

12:33.017 --> 12:36.005
It's every man, woman and brick
for themselves now.

12:36.007 --> 12:38.004
Enough!

12:38.006 --> 12:39.020
I won't have you
arguing over this.

12:39.022 --> 12:41.022
You're talking as though
I'm already dead.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.014
I will work this out.

12:46.016 --> 12:49.003
What do you mean?
You already have.

12:50.015 --> 12:51.021
Moment of truth, Chief,

12:51.023 --> 12:53.008
because this is what
you've been planning

12:53.010 --> 12:55.003
for our entire lives.

12:55.005 --> 12:56.009
So what's it gonna be?

12:56.011 --> 12:57.018
Ladies and gentlemen,

12:57.020 --> 13:00.002
is he going to cook his body
with radiation

13:00.004 --> 13:01.021
and wrap himself in bandages?

13:01.023 --> 13:04.005
Or, will he inject himself
with toxic dye

13:04.007 --> 13:07.023
so he could gloop in the middle
of Dorothy's parent-teacher
conference?

13:08.001 --> 13:09.010
Or maybe he's gonna
shoot himself up

13:09.012 --> 13:10.019
six ways from Sunday

13:10.021 --> 13:12.007
and hope that
one of his 64 personalities

13:12.009 --> 13:14.007
could teach Dorothy
how to cash a check.

13:14.009 --> 13:17.018
Better yet, will he yank out
that very special brain of his

13:17.020 --> 13:19.012
and become the Tin Man?

13:19.014 --> 13:21.018
And, Chief,
if that's your best option,

13:21.020 --> 13:24.007
then you better go
smell some roses,

13:24.009 --> 13:25.012
suck on a Bud Light,

13:25.014 --> 13:26.022
fuck a watermelon,

13:27.000 --> 13:28.010
eat a double-double
and take a big ol' shit

13:28.012 --> 13:30.019
because all of that is gone!

13:30.021 --> 13:33.015
Every sensation, gone-zo!

13:33.017 --> 13:36.006
Oh, and be sure
to hug Dorothy now.

13:36.008 --> 13:37.017
Hug her hard

13:37.019 --> 13:40.003
because hugging your daughter
after your Franken-surgery

13:40.005 --> 13:41.021
is gonna rip your heart out

13:41.023 --> 13:44.003
because you can't
fucking feel her!

13:45.014 --> 13:47.007
Spin the wheel, Niles Caulder.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.023
Which one of us
are you gonna be?

13:52.017 --> 13:54.000
[Larry] None of us.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.007
Right, Niles?

14:00.015 --> 14:02.013
We're your failed experiments.

14:07.010 --> 14:10.017
Oh, you're
looking dapper, Larry.

14:13.023 --> 14:15.014
[Larry] My son is dead.

14:15.016 --> 14:17.015
Oh, did Chief get him, too?

14:17.017 --> 14:18.021
[shouting] Shut up, Cliff!

14:22.017 --> 14:25.004
I'm so sorry for your loss.

14:29.016 --> 14:30.020
[Larry] Uh, it's okay.

14:33.005 --> 14:35.007
I doubt he even knew I existed.

14:45.009 --> 14:47.021
I suggest
we each tend to our own.

14:49.012 --> 14:52.006
My fate doesn't
concern you anymore.

15:08.009 --> 15:11.011
[woman] <i>I told her</i>
<i>I had her six.</i>

15:13.002 --> 15:15.017
[scoffs] I thought
I went to hell and back.

15:17.003 --> 15:18.020
And then...

15:18.022 --> 15:20.010
And then this happened...

15:20.012 --> 15:21.019
out of nowhere.

15:23.019 --> 15:25.013
Felt like it was my fault.

15:27.012 --> 15:29.007
I... I sort of spun out...

15:30.006 --> 15:31.013
thinking of

15:31.015 --> 15:33.004
thousands of ways...

15:34.018 --> 15:36.005
[voice fading]

15:45.011 --> 15:47.005
Hang on.

15:47.007 --> 15:48.011
Is there a reason

15:48.013 --> 15:51.008
why the rules
don't apply to him, or...

15:51.010 --> 15:53.017
Everyone's late
once in a while.

15:53.019 --> 15:55.012
Why not give him a chance?

15:55.014 --> 15:56.022
Take a breath, Roni.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.005
Get back in your lane

15:58.007 --> 16:00.001
and finish your share.

16:01.011 --> 16:02.019
[sighs]

16:07.006 --> 16:09.003
After I got the call...

16:10.021 --> 16:13.006
I couldn't help but think
that it was my fault.

16:13.018 --> 16:14.022
And...

16:17.004 --> 16:18.006
I'm sorry.

16:21.001 --> 16:22.009
I can't do this.

16:27.003 --> 16:28.010
[facilitator] All right.

16:30.009 --> 16:31.020
Who else wants to share?

16:33.013 --> 16:34.017
No one?

16:35.015 --> 16:37.004
Really?

16:37.006 --> 16:38.023
I think I speak
for the group when I say,

16:39.001 --> 16:43.017
no one is gonna wanna share
with Cyborg in the room.

16:43.019 --> 16:46.014
Everyone knows
the dude's face is a camera.

16:46.016 --> 16:49.005
Might as well be broadcasting
your trauma on TV.

16:49.007 --> 16:50.018
Is that true?

16:50.020 --> 16:53.005
It's not that simple.
I don't really have a choice.

16:53.007 --> 16:54.020
If I'm powered up,
the camera's on.

16:54.022 --> 16:56.008
Group is a safe space.

16:56.010 --> 16:58.022
We don't allow
recording devices
of any kind.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.021
You need to turn it off
if you wanna stay.

17:00.023 --> 17:03.001
No, then I'd have
no defense system.

17:03.003 --> 17:04.010
That would leave me vulnerable.

17:04.012 --> 17:06.008
That's kind of the point
of a trauma group.

17:15.021 --> 17:17.008
[device powering down]

17:18.012 --> 17:20.001
Thanks.

17:20.003 --> 17:22.005
Any chance you wanna share?

17:22.007 --> 17:23.018
We'd like to get to know you.

17:23.020 --> 17:25.009
Tell us why you're here.

17:28.020 --> 17:29.022
Okay.

17:37.023 --> 17:39.002
My name is Vic.

17:47.006 --> 17:49.015
Actually, I'm just
gonna listen today.

17:53.019 --> 17:54.020
[knocking on door]

17:56.012 --> 17:57.020
Dorothy?

17:59.022 --> 18:01.023
Please, talk to me.

18:06.003 --> 18:07.014
Ahhh!

18:07.016 --> 18:09.003
Knock knock!

18:10.005 --> 18:11.023
Knock knock!

18:12.001 --> 18:13.007
Who's there?

18:13.009 --> 18:14.023
Armageddon.

18:15.001 --> 18:16.014
Armageddon who?

18:16.016 --> 18:19.005
Armageddon tired
of all this knocking.

18:19.007 --> 18:20.007
[laughs]

18:21.015 --> 18:23.011
[breathing heavily]

18:24.006 --> 18:25.014
Very funny, Dorothy.

18:25.016 --> 18:28.018
[Dorothy] That was Herschel,
not me.

18:30.005 --> 18:32.001
I don't know
what you've been told...

18:33.009 --> 18:35.004
Nothing is going
to happen to me.

18:35.006 --> 18:37.005
[Dorothy]
You can't promise that!

18:37.007 --> 18:39.021
You're going to die...

18:39.023 --> 18:41.008
soon.

18:41.010 --> 18:44.010
And I don't even know
how to do anything.

18:44.012 --> 18:47.002
Who's going to teach me
how to drive,

18:47.004 --> 18:48.015
how to cook things?

18:48.017 --> 18:51.005
Who's going to walk me
down the aisle at my wedding?

18:51.007 --> 18:54.012
I will find a way.
I promise.

18:55.015 --> 18:58.022
[Dorothy] I could make
a wish...

19:00.001 --> 19:04.022
Dorothy... never, ever...

19:05.000 --> 19:08.003
Not for me,
not for anything.

19:10.006 --> 19:12.000
Do you understand me?

19:12.002 --> 19:13.003
[Dorothy] Yes.

19:14.002 --> 19:15.011
I'm sorry.

19:20.004 --> 19:21.011
[sighs]

19:26.014 --> 19:28.017
[Cliff] Now, that's what
I'm talking about!

19:28.019 --> 19:32.001
RIP Chief!
Time to hit the open road.

19:32.003 --> 19:33.009
Where are we going?

19:33.011 --> 19:34.019
I'm not leaving.
I'm moving back in.

19:34.021 --> 19:37.011
After everything
that bastard did to us?

19:37.013 --> 19:38.011
We're big now, Jane.

19:38.013 --> 19:39.018
We can go anywhere.

19:39.020 --> 19:41.020
What's with this "we" shit?

19:41.022 --> 19:43.001
There is no "we."

19:43.003 --> 19:45.016
I... need Chief.

19:45.018 --> 19:48.022
<i>You</i><i>can do</i>
whatever the fuck you want.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.022
Birthday party entertainer,
trash compactor...

19:52.000 --> 19:54.015
your options are endless,
but also less than five.

19:54.017 --> 19:56.003
[Cliff] Why do you need him?

19:56.005 --> 19:57.021
Because shit's getting weird
in the Underground.

19:57.023 --> 20:00.003
And the one thing
that was keeping me
on the surface

20:00.005 --> 20:01.008
just ran out, okay?

20:01.010 --> 20:03.005
I don't know
how much longer I have

20:03.007 --> 20:05.002
before the rest of me
has their way.

20:06.012 --> 20:09.002
[Cliff] Wait, what's that
supposed to mean?

20:09.004 --> 20:10.018
Jane, do you need help?

20:10.020 --> 20:13.004
-Not unless you're a chemist.
-Come on.

20:13.006 --> 20:14.021
That's what you think
you need?

20:15.021 --> 20:17.022
All you gotta do
is talk to me.

20:19.021 --> 20:22.023
What's going on,
you know, in there?

20:23.001 --> 20:27.008
This co-dependent routine
is getting stale, Cliff.

20:27.010 --> 20:29.013
Go, stay...
do whatever you want,

20:29.015 --> 20:30.016
just don't do it for me.

20:30.018 --> 20:32.003
[Cliff] Okay, for the record,

20:32.005 --> 20:34.018
I am not dependent
on anybody.

20:34.020 --> 20:36.019
I am my own robot.

20:37.013 --> 20:38.021
[sighs]

21:00.005 --> 21:01.017
It's not enough.

21:03.008 --> 21:05.012
-[bangs]
-It'll never be enough!

21:05.014 --> 21:07.022
[Rita] I'm trying not
to take this personally.

21:08.019 --> 21:10.004
Take what personally?

21:10.006 --> 21:11.020
That you're throwing
a pity party

21:11.022 --> 21:13.017
and you didn't invite me.

21:13.019 --> 21:14.021
Rita...

21:16.012 --> 21:17.023
I've made a terrible mess
of things.

21:18.001 --> 21:19.012
Understatement.

21:21.019 --> 21:25.014
Look, if I can't apply
this mess

21:25.016 --> 21:27.010
into something useful,

21:27.012 --> 21:31.017
I don't see the point
of anything, really.

21:31.019 --> 21:34.010
And if I'm trying,
then you are, too.

21:34.012 --> 21:35.019
So, snap out of it.

21:35.021 --> 21:37.020
You've had lifetimes
to plan for this.

21:37.022 --> 21:39.011
Surely there was a plan B.

21:39.013 --> 21:41.014
-You were plan B.
-[scoffs]

21:41.016 --> 21:42.020
C, then?

21:42.022 --> 21:44.016
Could be plan F,
for all I care.

21:44.018 --> 21:47.013
But you're not going to
mope around

21:47.015 --> 21:49.015
while death catches up
to you.

21:52.007 --> 21:54.015
What is this?
What are you looking at?

21:54.017 --> 21:56.012
Ah! Don't touch that.

21:56.014 --> 21:59.002
That's continuinium,

21:59.004 --> 22:03.006
a rare mineral that can
bend time.

22:04.005 --> 22:06.011
-Continue...
-"...inium."

22:06.013 --> 22:08.019
-Continuinium.
-No, I mean continue...

22:08.021 --> 22:11.001
-Keep talking.
-It doesn't matter.

22:12.003 --> 22:13.005
There isn't enough.

22:13.007 --> 22:15.004
But this sounds
promising, Niles.

22:15.006 --> 22:19.008
I mean, time is what you need,
after all.

22:19.010 --> 22:20.014
Where do we get more?

22:20.016 --> 22:24.006
Continuinium
does not exist naturally

22:25.007 --> 22:26.007
on Earth.

22:26.009 --> 22:28.004
It was discovered
in a meteorite

22:28.006 --> 22:29.018
on a beach in Bali

22:29.020 --> 22:32.020
by... one man.

22:36.022 --> 22:38.013
[clears throat]

22:38.015 --> 22:41.022
"The Journal
of Doctor Jonathan Tyme."

22:42.000 --> 22:43.014
T-Y-M-E.

22:44.020 --> 22:45.022
It's not a real name.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
He was a normal man.

22:48.002 --> 22:50.004
Just as real as you or I.

22:50.006 --> 22:53.023
He was on a journey
of spiritual awakening.

22:54.001 --> 22:55.018
A meteorite struck,

22:55.020 --> 22:58.014
and when he laid his hands
on the glowing crystals
therein...

22:59.005 --> 23:00.021
he went mad.

23:00.023 --> 23:05.004
Able to manipulate time itself.

23:05.006 --> 23:09.021
These journal entries
are dated 4067,

23:09.023 --> 23:14.010
1776, 6000 BCE.

23:14.012 --> 23:16.008
He continued
his little walkabout

23:16.010 --> 23:18.020
through every era
of history,

23:18.022 --> 23:21.003
continuinium in hand.

23:21.005 --> 23:23.004
As he travelled,
his legend grew

23:23.006 --> 23:26.003
and he became known as
"The Terrible Dr. Tyme."

23:26.018 --> 23:29.005
T-Y-M-E.

23:29.007 --> 23:30.022
And he stuck
with that spelling?

23:32.002 --> 23:33.013
Well, then...

23:35.011 --> 23:38.004
how do we find this
Doctor Tyme?

23:56.003 --> 23:57.012
You're not gonna rust?

24:04.020 --> 24:06.005
I'm not sorry.

24:09.017 --> 24:12.020
For the whole
camera face thing.

24:12.022 --> 24:16.005
Things said in Group,
need to stay in Group.

24:16.007 --> 24:17.014
You shouldn't apologize.

24:17.016 --> 24:19.002
You're not sorry,

24:19.020 --> 24:21.009
and I'm not upset.

24:23.004 --> 24:25.001
I'm grateful, actually.

24:25.003 --> 24:27.015
I'm new to this.
I don't know the rules.

24:27.017 --> 24:30.006
And I'm sorry
for interrupting your share.

24:30.008 --> 24:31.009
Don't be.

24:31.011 --> 24:34.004
Saying the same shit
for months.

24:34.006 --> 24:36.011
Sounds like you went
through hell in the war.

24:39.023 --> 24:41.023
I wasn't talking
about the war.

24:44.008 --> 24:47.007
I was talking about
my mother's death.

24:47.009 --> 24:51.008
Just because I'm a vet
doesn't mean my whole life
is defined by my service.

24:51.010 --> 24:52.022
Sorry, I...

24:54.011 --> 24:56.004
That's what I get
for showing up late.

24:56.006 --> 24:57.014
And making assumptions.

24:57.016 --> 24:59.015
And making assumptions.

25:02.016 --> 25:05.002
For what it's worth,
I lost my mother, too.

25:09.020 --> 25:11.000
How did she die?

25:12.019 --> 25:14.000
Accident.

25:15.011 --> 25:16.012
Yours?

25:17.009 --> 25:18.020
Same.

25:18.022 --> 25:20.004
Look, I get it...

25:22.018 --> 25:26.012
the guilt, the replaying...

25:26.014 --> 25:28.011
the sadness that creeps in
every day...

25:28.013 --> 25:31.012
but that's not actually
why I'm here.

25:31.014 --> 25:35.007
I'm dealing with some kind of
post-traumatic stress.

25:35.009 --> 25:37.020
Don't bother delineating.

25:37.022 --> 25:43.000
If I went to a different
support group for every trauma,
diagnosis and "ism" I've got,

25:43.002 --> 25:45.005
it'd be a full-time job.

25:45.007 --> 25:47.019
I guess we're a bunch
of Venn diagrams, aren't we?

25:47.021 --> 25:49.016
[chuckles]

25:49.018 --> 25:51.003
Yeah.

25:51.005 --> 25:53.014
Some messier than others.

25:53.016 --> 25:55.016
Hey, do you wanna
grab a bite

25:55.018 --> 25:57.005
and not talk about our moms?

26:00.011 --> 26:02.018
Imagine a world...

26:02.020 --> 26:05.010
A world that time forgot.

26:05.012 --> 26:08.017
A world where all you have
is time.

26:08.019 --> 26:10.011
A world where time is
of the essence.

26:10.013 --> 26:12.003
Stop saying "time."

26:12.005 --> 26:14.013
Where it's our time to shine.

26:15.011 --> 26:17.005
[Cliff] What the fuck is that?

26:20.004 --> 26:21.016
-You forgot--
-That's how it's spelled.

26:21.018 --> 26:23.006
Okay.

26:23.008 --> 26:26.007
This is an artist's rendition
of Dr. Tyme.

26:26.009 --> 26:28.020
-Did Dorothy draw that?
-[scoffs]

26:28.022 --> 26:31.011
I drew it.
Please focus.

26:31.013 --> 26:33.014
Dr. Tyme is
a history-hopping madman

26:33.016 --> 26:35.021
who, according to the Chief,
wears a special helmet

26:35.023 --> 26:38.018
that may contain
enough continuinium...

26:38.020 --> 26:42.019
It's a space mineral
that can control time.

26:42.021 --> 26:46.020
And if we can steal
this man's helmet,

26:46.022 --> 26:50.011
we may be able
to slow the Chief's aging.

26:53.009 --> 26:55.007
It seems like you got it
all figured out.

26:55.009 --> 26:59.014
[Cliff] Wait, you want us
to steal some douchebag's
helmet for the Chief?

27:00.018 --> 27:04.001
Will this continuum shit

27:04.003 --> 27:06.012
stop the Chief
from locking up his daughter
for another century?

27:06.014 --> 27:09.018
At the very least,
he'll be alive long enough
to find other options.

27:09.020 --> 27:11.008
[Cliff] You aren't seriously
considering--

27:11.010 --> 27:12.012
Maybe I am.

27:12.014 --> 27:13.015
[Cliff groans]

27:13.017 --> 27:15.011
Because you
and half the Underground

27:15.013 --> 27:18.000
can't seem to remember
that I'm generally opposed

27:18.002 --> 27:19.018
to putting little girls
in cages...

27:19.020 --> 27:21.009
[Cliff] Holy fucking...

27:21.011 --> 27:23.018
...so as long as
I'm on the surface,
I'm helping.

27:23.020 --> 27:26.019
I can't believe
we're even being asked

27:26.021 --> 27:29.003
to bail out the Chief
after what he's done.

27:29.005 --> 27:31.006
I draw the line.
I'm out.

27:31.008 --> 27:33.003
[Niles] I agree with Cliff.

27:34.018 --> 27:39.004
I've told Rita,
it is too dangerous.

27:39.006 --> 27:42.017
I have sent three
Bureau of Normalcy agents

27:42.019 --> 27:45.001
after Dr. Tyme
over the years.

27:45.003 --> 27:47.012
None of them have returned.

27:47.014 --> 27:50.016
[Cliff] Hold on...
You don't want us to go?

27:50.018 --> 27:51.022
That's correct.

27:53.007 --> 27:55.023
You don't want us
to extend your life?

27:56.001 --> 27:57.004
Not like this

27:57.006 --> 27:58.022
-Is this reverse psychology?
-No.

28:00.017 --> 28:03.014
Then fuck it. I'm in!

28:03.016 --> 28:04.023
[giggles] Oh, goodie!

28:10.016 --> 28:13.013
Dr. Tyme is encapsulated
in a temporal sphere

28:13.015 --> 28:16.018
orbiting somewhere
between space and time.

28:16.020 --> 28:18.017
[Cliff] You could just say
"time capsule."

28:18.019 --> 28:23.021
I cannot stress enough,
once you're inside
Dr. Tyme's time capsule,

28:23.023 --> 28:26.004
you must be on your guard.

28:26.006 --> 28:29.013
He wields time both
as a lure and as a weapon.

28:29.015 --> 28:33.023
It's highly likely you'll be
walking straight into a trap.

28:34.001 --> 28:37.012
Continuinium,
it's highly volatile.

28:37.014 --> 28:41.004

if you acquire it,

28:41.006 --> 28:42.021
don't touch it!

28:47.010 --> 28:50.017
[Cliff] Hold up, isn't that
just purple Boggle salt?

28:52.001 --> 28:54.017
By creating
this traversable wormhole,

28:54.019 --> 28:58.006
you'll be able to travel
into Dr. Tyme's capsule
and return.

28:58.008 --> 28:59.015

29:18.006 --> 29:21.005

-Wait, no. Not yet.

29:22.013 --> 29:26.000

-Oh, my God.

29:26.002 --> 29:27.022
-Can we do this already?
-On my count.

29:28.000 --> 29:31.005
One, two, three.

29:31.007 --> 29:33.004

29:33.006 --> 29:35.003

qualifying to race in
Tampa Bay, Florida,

it is for him

39:21.004 --> 39:23.014
this is where
humanity peaked.

39:23.016 --> 39:26.003
-Come on.
-[grunts]

39:26.005 --> 39:27.016
I'm trying.

39:29.006 --> 39:32.021
I was hoping you were here
for more than my continuinium.

39:32.023 --> 39:34.008
I don't know what you...

39:34.010 --> 39:38.001
Well, surely
you already
knew that, uh,

39:38.003 --> 39:41.000
-seeing the
future and all.
-Hmm.

39:41.002 --> 39:43.011
[Dr. Tyme] I prefer to live
in the moment, baby.

39:43.013 --> 39:45.012
Besides, many have
come for this,

39:45.014 --> 39:47.005
but none have succeeded.

39:47.007 --> 39:50.007
[Cliff] This is nuts.
We don't have
time for this shit.

39:50.009 --> 39:52.000
Find some skates
and get out there.

39:52.002 --> 39:55.010
Why the fuck would you assume
that I know how to skate?

39:55.012 --> 39:57.015
Do I always have
to clarify this?

39:57.017 --> 39:59.009
Does any
one-sixty-fourth of you

39:59.011 --> 40:01.011
know how to skate?

40:01.013 --> 40:02.015
Or chew lightning,

40:02.017 --> 40:04.007
-or anything helpful?
-Maybe.

40:04.009 --> 40:07.017
But the others
are sort of... doped.

40:08.012 --> 40:10.016
This, Jane, is why

40:10.018 --> 40:13.011
we don't do drugs.

40:14.016 --> 40:15.019
I can't.

40:15.021 --> 40:17.022
I can't. I can't.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.000
-I can't.
-Sh... shit.

40:20.002 --> 40:22.009
[Dr. Tyme] Ain't nobody
stopping this party.

40:22.011 --> 40:26.017
[Cliff grunts]
No more "Bad Girls."

40:28.018 --> 40:32.000
Oh, shit!

40:39.019 --> 40:41.007
-[exclaims]
-[grunts]

40:41.020 --> 40:42.021
[grunts]

40:45.005 --> 40:46.007
[gasps]

40:47.017 --> 40:49.020
Rita, what
did you do?

40:49.022 --> 40:51.023
You told me
to grab his helmet!

40:52.001 --> 40:53.017
That's not his helmet,
that's his head.

40:53.019 --> 40:56.013
[Cliff] Holy shit!
The continue brain
thingie is loose!

40:57.011 --> 40:59.018
[speaking Japanese]

41:02.019 --> 41:04.020
[man grunts]

41:04.022 --> 41:07.020
[speaking other language]

41:09.001 --> 41:10.006
[grunts]

41:10.008 --> 41:13.019
[Cliff] I am not babysitting
my nemesis's kid.

41:17.007 --> 41:19.011
Hey, you Niles's guys?

41:20.019 --> 41:22.017
Fuck you, government asswipes.

41:22.019 --> 41:24.008
[Dr. Tyme groaning]

41:24.010 --> 41:27.011
I swear to God,
I thought it was a helmet.

41:28.018 --> 41:30.012
Grab the brain, asshole!

41:44.003 --> 41:45.012
-Satan, be gone!
-Help me.

41:50.009 --> 41:52.014
[Cliff screaming] No!

41:54.016 --> 41:56.000
[Rita] Hang in there.

41:57.004 --> 41:58.007
[screams]

41:59.008 --> 42:01.015
-[woman shrieks]
-[man grunting]

42:15.015 --> 42:17.005
[Dr. Tyme groaning]

42:22.003 --> 42:23.021
[speaking backwards]

42:26.010 --> 42:28.014
[both speaking
other languages backwards]

42:36.013 --> 42:38.008
[gasps]

42:38.010 --> 42:41.011
I've seen your like
from birth to death,
Gertrude Cramp,

42:41.013 --> 42:42.022
Your mother was
right about you.

42:43.000 --> 42:45.019
No matter what,
or how hard you try,

42:45.021 --> 42:49.006
you'll never be anything
but a fraud.

42:49.008 --> 42:50.014
What did you say?

42:50.016 --> 42:53.012
I said,
you're out of the party.

42:58.010 --> 42:59.015
Oh, thank heavens.

43:02.019 --> 43:03.014
Did you get it?

43:03.016 --> 43:06.013
Of course we didn't.

43:06.015 --> 43:10.004
Another adventure,
another trigger,
what else is fuckin' new?

43:10.006 --> 43:11.014
[Cliff] Did you
know the thing

43:11.016 --> 43:12.023
we were going after
wasn't a headpiece?

43:13.001 --> 43:15.006
-It was a guy's head.
-I warned you.

43:15.008 --> 43:16.017
My research was thin.

43:16.019 --> 43:18.013
Oh, but
confident enough
to call him terrible

43:18.015 --> 43:20.018
even though he was just
some self-absorbed putz.

43:20.020 --> 43:22.013
It seems to me
like you wanted
a hit squad

43:22.015 --> 43:23.022
to invade
a time capsule

43:24.000 --> 43:26.020
-and murder a guy.
-I asked for no such thing.

43:26.022 --> 43:28.018
For the last time,
I never asked for--

43:28.020 --> 43:31.005
-[slaps]
-Stop saying that.

43:33.011 --> 43:34.018
You turned us
into what we are.

43:34.020 --> 43:37.011
[sobbing] And now I can
only do one thing,

43:37.013 --> 43:40.000
and we can't
even do that.

45:23.009 --> 45:24.017
[sighs]

45:55.003 --> 45:56.006
[sighs]

46:13.001 --> 46:14.004
[sobbing softly]

46:20.016 --> 46:23.001
[sobbing]

46:28.000 --> 46:29.010
I'm so sorry.

46:47.018 --> 46:52.003
Father in heaven,
we beseech you,
cast away the demons

46:52.005 --> 46:55.005
who have grown in Kay Challis
these seven years.

46:55.007 --> 47:00.001
Cast away the spirit
and return Kay to our flock.

47:00.003 --> 47:04.017
Restore her to her
ever-suffering mother.

47:04.019 --> 47:06.014
Please, Momma,
help me. [screams]

47:06.016 --> 47:09.021
[man] Lord,
we praise you
with all our hearts,

47:09.023 --> 47:14.006
and we know that Satan
cannot abide where
you are present.

47:14.008 --> 47:15.016
Feel your presence.

47:15.018 --> 47:18.001
Prince of Darkness,
you are not welcome.

47:18.003 --> 47:19.010
Satan!

47:19.012 --> 47:20.016
Be gone!

47:24.005 --> 47:26.018
I'll tear your face off!

47:28.023 --> 47:30.007
Help me.

47:33.006 --> 47:34.020
We deserve this.

47:37.013 --> 47:39.019
[woman 1] <i>Kay,</i>
<i>let me go up for you.</i>

47:39.021 --> 47:41.011
[woman 2]
<i>Who is this lady?</i>

47:41.013 --> 47:43.004
[woman 3]
<i>Just give them Kay.</i>
<i>If we don't,</i>

47:43.006 --> 47:44.017
<i>we'll all die.</i>

47:44.019 --> 47:46.016
[woman 1] <i>No,</i>
<i>the girl stays safe.</i>

47:46.018 --> 47:48.006
<i>I can do this, Kay.</i>

47:48.008 --> 47:49.017
<i>I know what you want.</i>

47:49.019 --> 47:51.007
<i>Let me go up for you.</i>

47:51.009 --> 47:52.008
[Jane] <i>Okay.</i>

48:01.006 --> 48:03.007
Thank you, brother.

48:03.009 --> 48:04.010
Oh, I see the light.

48:04.012 --> 48:05.018
I am saved!

48:06.013 --> 48:08.014
Hallelujah!

48:10.019 --> 48:13.013
[Elena speaking Spanish]

48:18.018 --> 48:20.014
Let's be clear, Elena.

48:21.007 --> 48:22.022
No amounts of holy water

48:23.000 --> 48:27.021
will ever purify
the sins you allowed
to go on in your home,

48:27.023 --> 48:31.009
and if you want
your sinful compliance
to stay buried,

48:31.011 --> 48:36.001
then you will call me...
Miranda.

48:40.020 --> 48:43.004
I've never
seen this before.

48:43.006 --> 48:45.006
Why am I watching
Miranda's memory?

48:46.008 --> 48:47.020
I'm being neutral here.

48:47.022 --> 48:50.002
Listen, if you want
to remain his primary

48:50.004 --> 48:51.020
while we get through
this rough patch,

48:51.022 --> 48:53.011
then so be it,

48:53.013 --> 48:55.022
But, you know,
change isn't all bad.

48:57.014 --> 49:00.011
You're saying that Miranda
would be a better primary.

49:00.013 --> 49:04.002
Newsflash,
she threw herself
into the fucking well.

49:05.002 --> 49:06.023
You don't have
to remind me,

49:07.001 --> 49:09.003
but before that,
long before any of us

49:09.005 --> 49:12.008
were subjected
to meta-human
experimentation,

49:12.010 --> 49:15.007
Miranda was... powerful.

49:16.013 --> 49:17.015
[Jane] Hey.

49:19.002 --> 49:20.017
What made her so powerful?

49:22.008 --> 49:24.001
She knew what the girl wanted.

49:29.012 --> 49:31.015
[Jane] <i>What made her</i>
<i>so powerful?</i>

49:31.017 --> 49:33.012
[Secretary] <i>She knew</i>
<i>what the girl wanted.</i>

49:34.011 --> 49:36.007
Maybe it is time
for a change.

49:42.022 --> 49:44.018
[knocks at door]

49:46.009 --> 49:47.020
What?

49:47.022 --> 49:49.007
[squeaks softly]

49:49.009 --> 49:50.020
Can you help me?

49:50.022 --> 49:54.019
No, I can't help you,
and I can't help your father.

49:54.021 --> 49:57.022
I'm an utter failure,
and I can't even
help myself.

49:58.017 --> 50:01.022
Not that kind of help.

50:06.009 --> 50:10.007
Now lightly whip
the egg batter
into a froth.

50:15.010 --> 50:17.011
<i>Clara was</i>
<i>deemed expendable.</i>

50:21.004 --> 50:22.021
<i>Clara was</i>
<i>deemed expendable.</i>

50:22.023 --> 50:24.022
[Cliff] <i>My daughter</i>
<i>was expendable,</i>

50:25.000 --> 50:27.011
<i>but yours has cost</i>
<i>how many lives?</i>

50:27.013 --> 50:30.023
<i>How is your kid</i>
<i>more important than mine?</i>

50:31.001 --> 50:33.011
<i>When backed into a corner,</i>
<i>I will do anything</i>

50:33.013 --> 50:35.004
<i>for my daughter.</i>

50:38.013 --> 50:40.011
[Cliff] Like chop me up.

50:40.013 --> 50:42.005
Not if I can
fucking help it.

50:42.007 --> 50:45.009
[people chattering
indistinctly]
