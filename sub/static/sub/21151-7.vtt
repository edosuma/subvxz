VETO, PULLS HIMSELF OFF, I AM

02:55.509 --> 02:57.077

03:16.430 --> 03:20.968
PLUS, IF YOU THOUGHT LAST WEEK'S

03:21.001 --> 03:24.805
VETO MEETING WAS EXPLOSIVE, YOU

04:11.218 --> 04:18.826
ADJOURNED.

04:18.859 --> 04:20.461
THIS WEEK I'M PULLING A CLASSIC

04:20.494 --> 04:21.895
"BIG BROTHER" MOVE, THE BACK

04:21.929 --> 04:22.996
DOOR.

04:23.030 --> 04:25.265
INSTEAD OF DIRECTLY PUTTING UP

04:25.299 --> 04:26.900
MY TARGET CODY, I'M GOING TO PUT

04:26.934 --> 04:29.169
UP A COUPLE PAWN, JOSH AND ALEX,

04:29.202 --> 04:31.539
SO CODY HAS LESS OF A CHANCE FOR

04:31.572 --> 04:33.707
COMPETING FOR THE POWER OF VETO,

04:33.741 --> 04:35.275
WHICH MAXIMIZES MY ODDS OF

04:35.309 --> 04:36.710
GETTING HIM OUT OF THAT GAME.

04:36.744 --> 04:39.813
>> IT NEVER FEELS GOOD TO BE ON

04:39.847 --> 04:41.515
THE BLOCK, BUT AT LEAST THERE IS

04:41.549 --> 04:44.352
PLAN TO GET OUT CODY.

04:44.385 --> 04:45.753
LET'S EXECUTE THE PLAN AND GET

04:45.786 --> 04:47.955
HIM OUT OF HERE.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.089
>> IT'S NOT LIT.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.324
>> IT'S NOT LIT.

04:50.358 --> 04:51.859
THIS IS NOT A GOOD SITUATION.

04:51.892 --> 04:54.061
>> THERE'S NO GOOD TIME TO EVER

04:54.094 --> 04:54.995
BE ON THE BLOCK.

04:55.028 --> 04:56.730
BUT SINCE CODY HAS BEEN CAUSING

04:56.764 --> 04:59.099
SO MUCH TROUBLE IN THIS HOUSE, I

04:59.132 --> 05:00.701
MIGHT NEVER GET A BETTER CHANCE

05:00.734 --> 05:04.171
THAN THIS.

05:04.204 --> 05:06.006
>> I KNOW THAT PAUL SAID I'M

05:06.039 --> 05:07.475
JUST A PAWN, BUT HOW CAN YOU

05:07.508 --> 05:09.109
TRUST THAT IN "BIG BROTHER"?

05:09.142 --> 05:10.911
I'VE SEEN LOTS OF "PAWNS" GO

05:10.944 --> 05:11.545
HOME.

05:11.579 --> 05:13.814
SO IF I WANT TO BE SAFE THIS

05:13.847 --> 05:17.685
WEEK, I NEED TO WIN THAT POV FOR

05:17.718 --> 05:18.318
MYSELF.

05:18.352 --> 05:19.219
>> THE LOOK OF DEFEAT IS SO

05:19.252 --> 05:19.853
SWEET.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.389
THE WILL BE OF DEFEAT IS SO

05:21.422 --> 05:25.726
SWEET.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.294
>> PAUL'S NOMINATIONS ARE ALL

05:27.327 --> 05:29.029
I KNOW I'M GETTING BACK DOORED

05:29.062 --> 05:29.663
THIS WEEK.

05:29.697 --> 05:30.531
I CAN SEE RIGHT THROUGH THE

05:30.564 --> 05:31.198
PLAN.

05:31.231 --> 05:32.566
I HAVE NOTHING THIS WEEK I CAN

05:32.600 --> 05:35.703
DO ACCEPT RELY ON MY NAME

05:35.736 --> 05:37.938
GETTING PULLED FOR THIS POWER OF

05:37.971 --> 05:40.774
VETO.

05:40.808 --> 05:51.552
>> WANT TO MAKE OUT?

05:51.585 --> 05:53.253
AT LEAST JOSH GOT A LITTLE TASTE

05:53.286 --> 05:55.923
OF HIS OWN MEDICINE.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.591
>> THAT WAS NOTHING.

05:57.625 --> 06:03.096
HE KNOWS.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.198
>> THE NOMINATIONS WERE PRETTY

06:05.232 --> 06:06.800
MUCH EXACTLY WHAT WE EXPECTED.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.301
THE GOOD OLD PASSIONED BECOME

06:08.335 --> 06:09.002
DOOR.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.203
THE ONLY THING THAT WE CAN HOPE

06:10.237 --> 06:12.005
FOR RIGHT NOW IS THAT EITHER

06:12.039 --> 06:13.206
CODY'S NAME OR MY NAME GETS

06:13.240 --> 06:14.875
DRAWN FOR THE VETO COMPETITION.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.510
BUT I'M GOING THE STAY BY CODE

06:16.544 --> 06:17.745
YES'S SIDE NO MATTER WHAT UNTIL

06:17.778 --> 06:28.021
THE END.

06:28.055 --> 06:31.291
>> THAT WAS A CUTE SPEECH.

06:31.324 --> 06:33.060
>> HEY.

06:33.093 --> 06:36.163
FOR YOUR COOPERATION IN KEEPING

06:36.196 --> 06:37.898
ME SAFE THIS WEEK, ALL WE ASK

06:37.931 --> 06:40.834
YOU TO DO IS YOU THROW THE VETO

06:40.868 --> 06:42.703
SO I CAN REPLACE THEM WITH CODY,

06:42.736 --> 06:43.837
OR YOU JUST SIT THERE.

06:43.871 --> 06:46.306
>> OTHER THAN CODY AND JESSICA

06:46.339 --> 06:47.407
POSSIBLY GETTING PICKED TO PLAY

06:47.441 --> 06:48.809
VETO, THE ONLY OTHER THING THAT

06:48.842 --> 06:50.978
CAN TOSS A WRENCH IS N MY PLAN

06:51.011 --> 06:52.880
IS IF RAMSES WINS THE VETO AND

06:52.913 --> 06:53.681
PULLS HIMSELF OFF.

06:53.714 --> 06:55.783
BECAUSE OF THE STIPULATION'S OF

06:55.816 --> 06:57.350
RAMSEY'S CURSE, IF HE WINS THE

06:57.384 --> 06:59.186
VETO AND PULLS HIMSELF OFF, I AM

06:59.219 --> 07:00.320
NOT ALLOWED TO REPLACE ANYBODY

07:00.353 --> 07:00.921
UP THERE.

07:00.954 --> 07:03.423
>> YOU ARE NOT GOING HOME.

07:03.457 --> 07:04.458
DOES THAT MAKE SENSE?

07:04.492 --> 07:05.459
EVERYBODY IS ON BOARD.

07:05.493 --> 07:07.561
YOU CAN ASK ANYBODY THIS N THIS

07:07.595 --> 07:08.095
ROOM.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.930
YOU WILL NOT GO HOME.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.331
THE ONLY WAY CODY WON'T BE UP

07:11.364 --> 07:13.934
THERE IS IF YOU PULL YOURSELF

07:13.967 --> 07:15.302
OFF OR... BECAUSE THEN THERE'S

07:15.335 --> 07:16.303
NO ONE ELSE TO PULL UP.

07:16.336 --> 07:18.071
>> I FEEL VERY ALONE IN THIS

07:18.105 --> 07:18.739
HOUSE RIGHT NOW.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.708
PAUL IS OUT HERE TRYING TO GET

07:20.741 --> 07:22.242
ME TO THROW THIS VETO.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.612
BUT HONESTLY, THERE'S NO BETTER

07:24.645 --> 07:25.445
SECURITY THAN HAVING THE POWER

07:25.479 --> 07:27.214
OF VETO, SO I'M GOING TO GUN IT

07:27.247 --> 07:28.982
AND MAKE SURE I GET THAT POWER.

07:29.016 --> 07:31.018
>> SO LET'S WORK AS A TEAM

07:31.051 --> 07:32.052
EFFORT THIS WEEK AND GET THE JOB

07:32.085 --> 07:32.620
DONE.

07:32.653 --> 07:36.189
>> OKAY.

07:36.223 --> 07:41.595
I'LL THING ABOUT IT, YOU GUYS.

07:41.629 --> 07:42.362
>> GOOD DAY?

07:42.395 --> 07:43.597
>> YEAH, GOOD DAY.

07:43.631 --> 07:45.065
>> GOOD TWO DAYS.

07:45.098 --> 07:52.439
>> I HAVE TO MAKE SURE RAMSES

07:52.472 --> 07:55.776
DOESN'T PULL A MOVE BECAUSE HE'S

07:55.809 --> 07:58.712
ALSO A BACK-UP PLAN IF ALL ELSE

07:58.746 --> 08:01.649
FAILS.

08:01.682 --> 08:04.117
>> OH, MY GOD.

08:04.151 --> 08:08.488
THE PUNISHMENT.

08:08.522 --> 08:14.895
>> THIS IS NOT GOOD.

08:42.055 --> 08:42.756
I'M GOING CRAZY.

08:42.790 --> 08:44.491
ALL I HOPE IS IT DOESN'T AFFECT

08:44.524 --> 08:46.694
ME OR MY GAME PLAY AND I'M NOT

08:46.727 --> 08:47.595

11:33.060 --> 11:38.698
SO I GOT TO CURSE CODY WITH THE

A BOOK REPORT, AND I DID IT ON

12:14.101 --> 12:15.035
HARRY HOUDINI.

12:15.068 --> 12:16.669
I DID MAGIC FOR A LONG TIME.

12:16.703 --> 12:18.538
THEN IN HIGH SCHOOL IT SLOWED

I CAN STILL DO THEM.

>> OUR GAME IS IN RAMSES' HANDS.

33:09.255 --> 33:10.622
HE'S GOING TO PULL HIMSELF OFF.

33:10.656 --> 33:12.258
SO IF I DON'T BEAT HIM, MY

33:35.814 --> 33:36.448
WINNER.

33:37.616 --> 33:38.784
IN THE COMPETITION EXCEPT FOR

33:38.817 --> 33:40.452
ME, WHICH MEANS IF HE WINS THE

33:40.486 --> 33:42.388
VETO, HE COULD PULL HIMSELF OFF

33:42.421 --> 33:46.125
AND RUIN MY PLAN ENTIRELY.

NOW IS BEAT PAUL'S TIME AND WE

33:50.496 --> 33:51.997
MIGHT ACTUALLY SURVIVE ANOTHER

33:52.030 --> 33:53.899
WEEK IN THIS HOUSE.

33:53.932 --> 33:55.834
PLEASE, GOD, LET RAMSES PULL

33:55.867 --> 33:57.836
THIS OFF.

CONGRATULATIONS, PAUL.

34:17.089 --> 34:20.659
YOU ARE THE WINNER.

34:20.692 --> 34:22.628
>> OH, WELL, GUESS WHO HAS ALL

34:22.661 --> 34:24.163
THE POWER THIS WEEK, AND RAMSES,

34:24.196 --> 34:25.764
YOU CAME IN SECOND PLACE AFTER I

34:25.797 --> 34:27.533
TOLD YOU TO THROW THE COMP, BUT

34:27.566 --> 34:29.668
COMING IN SECOND PLACE IS

34:29.701 --> 34:30.469
DEFINITELY NOT THROWING THE

34:30.502 --> 34:36.808
COMP.

34:36.842 --> 34:39.178
THIS JUST WENT HORRIBLY WRONG.

34:39.211 --> 34:40.846
I ALMOST JUST WON A VETO THAT I

34:40.879 --> 34:44.616
WAS SUPPOSED TO THROW BIG TIME.

34:44.650 --> 34:46.185
I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW I'M

34:46.218 --> 34:47.986
GOING THE DAMAGE CONTROL SO THIS

34:48.019 --> 34:48.954
ENTIRE HOUSE DOESN'T COME

34:48.987 --> 34:59.030
AGAINST ME.

34:59.030 --> 35:05.304
AGAINST ME.

35:05.337 --> 35:07.105
>> WELL, I DIDN'T GET TO PLAY IN

35:07.139 --> 35:07.673
THE VETO COMPETITION.

35:07.706 --> 35:10.041
PAUL GETS THE VETO.

35:10.075 --> 35:11.410
IT DIDN'T MATTER WHO WON.

35:11.443 --> 35:13.279
PAUL WAS GOING THE UTILIZE THEM

35:13.312 --> 35:15.113
TO USE THE VETO AND THEN BACK

35:15.147 --> 35:18.784
DOOR ME.

35:18.817 --> 35:19.418
I'M IN THE SHOCKED.

35:19.451 --> 35:22.688
>> I KNOW.

35:22.721 --> 35:24.323
WHEN AM I GOING TO GIVE UP ON

35:24.356 --> 35:26.792

35:26.825 --> 35:28.594
IT'S REALLY HARD TO PICTURE THIS

35:28.627 --> 35:30.396
HOUSE WITHOUT CODY.

35:30.429 --> 35:32.331
I JUST WISH THINGS WERE

35:32.364 --> 35:37.536
DIFFERENT.

35:37.569 --> 35:39.205
>> ONE DAY WE'RE GOING HAVE TO

35:39.238 --> 35:41.039
HAVE A REALLY GOOD LAUGH, LAUGH

35:41.072 --> 35:44.643
AND LAUGH AND LAUGH.

35:44.676 --> 35:46.878
>> YOUR LIPS TASTE GOOD.

36:21.780 --> 36:22.881
>> NO, NO, NO.

36:22.914 --> 36:24.716
>> I WAS JUST GOING THE SAY, I

36:24.750 --> 36:26.952
KNOW THAT LOOKED VERY SKETCHY

36:26.985 --> 36:29.087
>> THAT WAS VERY SKETCHY.

36:29.120 --> 36:30.889
>> I KNOW, BUT I SWEAR TO YOU, I

36:30.922 --> 36:32.090
WAS NOT TRYING TO WIN THAT.

36:32.123 --> 36:34.360
>> DUDE, I...

36:34.393 --> 36:37.095
>> I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO

36:37.128 --> 36:37.696
WIN.

36:37.729 --> 36:39.465
>> ALL I CAN DO IS WITH B

36:39.498 --> 36:40.131
STRAIGHT UP WITH HIM.

36:40.165 --> 36:41.500
I WANT HIM THE KNOW THAT I WAS

36:41.533 --> 36:42.901
NOT TRYING TO WIN THIS VETO.

36:42.934 --> 36:44.803
I WANTED TO THROW IT SO THAT THE

36:44.836 --> 36:49.908
PLAN GOES THROUGH.

36:49.941 --> 36:51.743
>> IT'S ALL RIGHT, DUDE.

36:51.777 --> 36:53.044
I DON'T CARE.

36:53.078 --> 36:55.146
THE VETO IS IN MY HANDS.

36:55.180 --> 36:56.214
I TRUST MYSELF.

36:56.248 --> 36:59.050
IT'S DONE.

36:59.084 --> 36:59.718
BOOK CLOSED.

36:59.751 --> 37:00.786
>> THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CODY

37:00.819 --> 37:02.854
AS A THREAT AND RAMSES AS A

37:02.888 --> 37:04.055
THREAT, CODY IS MORE DIRECT.

37:04.089 --> 37:05.391
AT LEAST I KNOW THAT CODY

37:05.424 --> 37:06.358
DOESN'T LIKE ME AND SOMEHOW

37:06.392 --> 37:08.193
WANTS ME OUT OF THIS GAME, BUT

37:08.226 --> 37:09.795
RAMSES, I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT

37:09.828 --> 37:11.162
THAT KID IS UP TO BECAUSE HE

37:11.196 --> 37:12.964
GOES AROUND AND DOES HIS LITTLE

37:12.998 --> 37:13.665
SNEAKY SNEAK.

37:13.699 --> 37:16.067
DO I TAKE CODY OUT THIS WEEK OR

37:16.101 --> 37:17.503
JUST LEAVE THE NOMINATIONS THE

37:17.536 --> 37:19.070
SAME AND GET RID OF THE SNAKE

37:19.104 --> 37:20.339
RAMSES SO I DON'T HAVE TO DEAL

37:20.372 --> 37:21.006
WITH HIM ANYMORE?

37:21.039 --> 37:24.242
>> I'M JUST GLAD THAT I GET A

37:24.276 --> 37:26.011
PERSON OUT WHO I DON'T THINK

37:26.044 --> 37:35.921
DESERVES TO BE PLAYING ANYMORE.

37:38.256 --> 37:40.225
>> IT'S TIME FOR AMERICA'S VOTE.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.192
YOU CAN TEMPT THE HOUSEGUEST OF

37:41.226 --> 37:43.261
YOUR CHOICE INSIDE THE DEN OF

37:43.295 --> 37:45.364
TEMPTATION.

37:45.397 --> 37:46.665
EACH TEMPTATION OFFERS AN

37:46.698 --> 37:47.299
ADVANTAGE THAT COULD HELP THEM

37:47.333 --> 37:48.934
IN THE GAME.

37:48.967 --> 37:50.902
BUT REMEMBER: IT ALSO COMES WITH

37:50.936 --> 37:51.837
A CONSEQUENCE THAT WILL AFFECT

37:51.870 --> 37:54.306
ONE OR MORE OF THEIR HOUSEMATES.

37:54.340 --> 37:57.676
THE THIRD TEMPTATION IS THE

37:57.709 --> 37:59.177
HALTING HEX.

37:59.210 --> 38:01.413
WHO DO YOU WANT TO RECEIVE THIS
