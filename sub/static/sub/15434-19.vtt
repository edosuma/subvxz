WEBVTT

00:00.200 --> 00:01.960
Previously on "Brothers & Sisters"...

00:01.980 --> 00:03.530
are you running for president?

00:03.550 --> 00:04.720
Why,yes,I am,ms. Walker.

00:04.740 --> 00:07.350
Don't begrudge me being hungry for a little bit of adult company.

00:07.370 --> 00:10.200
You're looking for something.I'm not engh forou.

00:10.220 --> 00:13.810
My husband kept a daughter from me and now you hang out with her?

00:13.830 --> 00:15.140
Did you honestly think I wouldn't meet her?

00:15.160 --> 00:16.290
She's my sister.

00:16.309 --> 00:18.440
I'm kinda used to being the bad influence around here.

00:18.468 --> 00:19.970
There's a new black sheep in town.

00:19.994 --> 00:21.961
-You have a gay brother?
-Yeah.

00:21.983 --> 00:22.748
Is he single?

00:22.761 --> 00:25.759
Kitty,do you want both of o brothers to kill you?

00:25.779 --> 00:28.982
Maybe you just haven't found the right... dude yet.

00:29.008 --> 00:31.862
What if chad was the right guy?
What if I pushed him away?

00:31.888 --> 00:33.753
During theescue...on the helicopter...

00:33.778 --> 00:36.502
It's all a blur.I let people people what they wanted...

00:36.526 --> 00:39.381
that I was a hero.I'm not.

00:41.465 --> 00:43.291
These are all the senator's college friends and roommates.

00:43.336 --> 00:44.383
Just debrief everybody,

00:44.385 --> 00:47.070
-make sure there won't be any surpses later in the campaign.
-Well,what kind of surprises?

00:47.098 --> 00:49.683
You know,bimbo eruptions,drug experimentation,

00:49.705 --> 00:51.840
bad real estate des--not that he's done any of that.

00:51.865 --> 00:53.180
This is about uncovering anything innocent

00:53.205 --> 00:55.312
that could be twisted into a smear campaign by an opponent.

00:55.336 --> 00:56.230
Swift boating.

00:56.257 --> 00:57.803
The only way to fight it is to get our facts in place

00:57.827 --> 01:00.402
so we can quickly refute disinformation before it gets any traction.

01:00.427 --> 01:01.880
Turns out I hate politics.

01:01.908 --> 01:03.091
-Who are you vetting?
-The family.

01:03.118 --> 01:05.453
I just snt two days getting an earful from the ex-wife.

01:05.477 --> 01:06.760
Really? Really?

01:06.786 --> 01:09.103
-And that file would be...
-encrypted.

01:09.128 --> 01:10.682
Ah. Oh,all right.

01:10.708 --> 01:11.833
Well,good thinking.

01:11.855 --> 01:13.752
Yeah. Okay,well,enjoy.

01:13.778 --> 01:16.101
Yeah. Yeah,whoopeE.

01:16.126 --> 01:21.002
So no drugs,no cating on exams,no hazing rituals?

01:21.017 --> 01:22.943
Mnh. Not tt I saw.

01:22.967 --> 01:24.593
Mm-hmm. Is there--is there anything that you could think of

01:24.615 --> 01:27.392
that could possibly embarrass the senator?

01:27.416 --> 01:29.270
Mm. He wet the bed a fetimes.

01:29.298 --> 01:32.310
For real? No!

01:33.975 --> 01:34.740
oh,that was a good one.

01:34.768 --> 01:36.841
Wet the bed,wet the bed--did he wet the bed?

01:36.868 --> 01:39.942
Oh,yeah. Yeah. Oh,we used to take baths together.

01:39.965 --> 01:43.642
That part I don't remember so well,but,uh,I got pictures.

01:43.927 --> 01:46.043
Pic... do you mean the--

01:46.066 --> 01:50.991
was that some sort of fraternity brother kind of thing?

01:51.185 --> 01:54.231
No.It was more of a brother/brother kind of thing.

01:56.037 --> 01:59.172
I'm jason... mccallister,bobby's younger brotR.

02:00.168 --> 02:02.960
oh,my god.I guess I'm--I'm in the wrong office.

02:02.985 --> 02:06.683
I-I was supposed to be interviewing the fraternity brother and--

02:06.707 --> 02:09.841
oh,my god,oh,my god,you're the gay brother!

02:09.868 --> 02:12.083
-You're kitty.
-Yeah. Oh,god,it's so--

02:12.106 --> 02:14.281
it's so great to finally meet you.

02:14.307 --> 02:15.620
So nice to meet you.

02:15.648 --> 02:17.160
Ah,I looked for you at the announcement.

02:17.185 --> 02:20.253
My,uh,my brother has a lot of nice things to say about you.

02:20.608 --> 02:22.252
Did he tell you that I have a gay brother?

02:22.275 --> 02:25.692
-No,but congratulations.
-Thank you,thank you.

02:25.716 --> 02:26.803
Now this isn't official,

02:26.828 --> 02:29.690
but,um,are you in a relationship right now?

02:30.587 --> 02:32.081
Are you crazy?

02:32.106 --> 02:34.140
Didn't your brother give you the "just because I'm gay

02:34.165 --> 02:36.491
doesn't mean you fix me up with every gay guy you meet" speech?

02:36.517 --> 02:37.910
I am very discriminating.

02:37.935 --> 02:40.810
And what is the harm if kevin and jason haen to have a cup of coffee together?

02:40.837 --> 02:42.633
Kitty,our lives are complicated enough.

02:42.658 --> 02:44.871
We already have romance and work overlapping.

02:44.897 --> 02:46.583
Let'not bring our families into it.

02:46.608 --> 02:48.753
Well,I actually think it'll go a long way with making

02:48.778 --> 02:51.611
my brother feel comfortable with our relationship,personal and professional.

02:51.636 --> 02:54.461
And what about my relationship with my brother?

02:54.485 --> 02:56.701
From what I hear,kevin's a serialater.

02:56.725 --> 02:57.882
no. No,no.

02:58.005 --> 03:01.163
He just--he just,you know,couldn't--no,no.

03:01.185 --> 03:02.952
He was just picking the wrong guys.

03:02.975 --> 03:03.693
Please,kitty.

03:03.716 --> 03:06.782
You used the phrase,and I'm quoting here,"man-whore."

03:06.806 --> 03:07.892
I did not.

03:07.915 --> 03:09.442
I-I want you to promise me.

03:09.466 --> 03:13.001
I want you to say the words--"no setups."

03:16.256 --> 03:18.961
-no setups.
-Thank you.

03:19.385 --> 03:21.211
-How'd the vetting sessn go?
-Fine.

03:21.236 --> 03:22.271
Nothing of consequence.

03:22.297 --> 03:25.583
You know,you really do have loyal... friends.

03:26.585 --> 03:28.432
What?

03:30.117 --> 03:32.922
I'm sorry,but I-I really feel like I have to ask this.

03:32.946 --> 03:37.412
The... the helicopter incident in kuwait,

03:37.436 --> 03:39.480
does anybody else know?

03:41.186 --> 03:44.181
Does anybody else know what really happened?

03:44.785 --> 03:47.383
No.Just you.

03:48.375 --> 03:51.502
You didn'tell your wife or your--your brher or--

03:51.528 --> 03:56.321
there was one other person in the cockpit,my copilot,and he's dd.

03:59.527 --> 04:01.100
-Nora,look at the size of tt thing.
-Yes,I see.

04:01.128 --> 04:02.703
That must weigh 35 pounds.

04:02.725 --> 04:03.780
That's why I brought you,saul.

04:03.808 --> 04:05.850
-You are my sherpa.
-I see.

04:06.216 --> 04:08.220
-nora,saul,how are you?
-Good.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.053
What can I get for you?

04:09.078 --> 04:11.840
I want that big,beautiful easter turkey right there.

04:11.866 --> 04:13.633
-Oh,don't hate me,okay?
-why?

04:13.657 --> 04:16.382
Last two turkeys in the shop,they're both reserved.

04:16.408 --> 04:18.000
Who reserves meat?

04:18.028 --> 04:20.839
Hey,you know what? We just got some beautiful ducks in.

04:20.867 --> 04:22.351
-You'll love them.
-ducks?

04:22.376 --> 04:24.232
-They're wonderful--
-ducks for easter?

04:24.255 --> 04:26.172
Oh,fine. Fine.

04:26.196 --> 04:27.861
-I don't want duc 
-ducks for easter. Fine,fine.

04:27.866 --> 04:29.313
Duck is fatty.

04:29.335 --> 04:31.420
this is what I wanted.

04:31.446 --> 04:32.742
-Crap.
-What?

04:32.768 --> 04:35.182
It's that insufferable miranda jones and her husband.

04:35.206 --> 04:36.390
-Where is she?
-Don't look. Don't look!

04:36.417 --> 04:38.513
I'm not looking. She's not insufferable. She's fine.

04:38.538 --> 04:40.552
-She's not so bad.
-Nora?

04:40.577 --> 04:43.190
-Miranda,hi!
-Nora! How are yo

04:43.218 --> 04:45.491
oh,my goodness.

04:45.515 --> 04:47.291
-great to see you.
-Good tsee you.

04:47.316 --> 04:49.641
Hey,saul.

04:49.666 --> 04:52.633
Oh,it's been so long,

04:52.657 --> 04:54.243
are you getting your easter dinner?

04:54.268 --> 04:56.950
Oh,well,it's not a dinner so much as a convention.

04:56.976 --> 04:58.713
Oh,yeah. All the kids are coming in.

04:58.735 --> 05:01.121
The five of them...Grandchildren in town.

05:01.146 --> 05:02.321
All 15 of them.

05:02.348 --> 05:03.463
-15?
-Yes.

05:05.945 --> 05:07.541
Well,I hope you weren't expecting turkey,

05:07.568 --> 05:09.631
'cause they seem to have all gone quickly this year.

05:09.656 --> 05:12.900
Oh,they always do. That's why I make a reservation.

05:14.506 --> 05:18.402
mrs. Jones,I'll have your turkeys wrapped and ready to go in a minute.

05:18.426 --> 05:19.562
Thank you.

05:19.587 --> 05:21.190
Here's your duck.

05:21.218 --> 05:23.340
you kids haven't even touched your duck.

05:23.367 --> 05:26.201
Are these the same ducks as the ones in the park,grandma?

05:26.225 --> 05:28.311
No,sweetheart,no,no,no.

05:28.335 --> 05:29.450
They're very different ducks.

05:29.477 --> 05:31.451
But they were alive at one time,right?

05:31.477 --> 05:33.560
Quack!Quack,quack,quack!

05:33.588 --> 05:35.340
paige,you don't have to eat your duck,

05:35.367 --> 05:37.082
but please eat your rice and your potato.

05:37.105 --> 05:39.470
But the duck's touching the ce and the potatoes.

05:39.504 --> 05:43.101
-Paige victoria.
-Wait a minute. This is duck?

05:43.213 --> 05:46.148
All right,kids,why don't you pass your plates 
over to uncle tommy and uncle kevin?

05:46.161 --> 05:50.329
Oh,yeah. Right. Yeah,we'll sit here and 
eat huey and dewey with these two staring at us.

05:50.689 --> 05:52.840
Hey,who wants hard-boiled eggs for dinner?

05:53.647 --> 05:55.460
Let's go find the easter baskets.

05:55.488 --> 05:57.840
-I'm sorry,mom.
-Oh,no,no,no. I'm sorry.

05:57.867 --> 05:59.841
It's miranda jones' fault.

05:59.867 --> 06:01.651
Oh! The joneses.

06:01.678 --> 06:03.210
I haven't seen them for years,

06:03.235 --> 06:06.632
not since the great game fight debacle.

06:08.198 --> 06:09.510
Okay,I'm almost afraid to ask.

06:09.538 --> 06:11.360
What's the great game night debacle?

06:11.385 --> 06:12.923
No. I-it's easter,okay?

06:12.947 --> 06:14.981
Do we have to talk about this?

06:18.516 --> 06:20.892
the jones family lived over on piedmont,

06:20.917 --> 06:22.551
and we used to play with them when we were growing up.

06:22.587 --> 06:24.631
They had five kids,and they were all the same ages.

06:24.655 --> 06:26.702
Yeah,we used to call them the "bizarro walkers."

06:27.535 --> 06:30.882
-Bizarro?
-They were just like us,only evil.

06:30.907 --> 06:33.403
They--they were perfectly nice,mother.

06:33.427 --> 06:36.000
It's just that you developed some sort of weird,unhealthy,

06:36.027 --> 06:39.042
psychotic,competitive relationship with them.

06:39.086 --> 06:40.030
-I did not.
-Yes,you did.

06:40.055 --> 06:42.022
-yeah,you did.
-I did not.

06:42.046 --> 06:45.021
Picture the bloods and the crips playing charades.

06:45.057 --> 06:46.233
That's what it was like.

06:46.258 --> 06:48.150
-kind of
so what was the debacle?

06:48.177 --> 06:51.402
Well,before you answer that,I'm gonna clear all the breakables out of kitty's reach.

06:51.425 --> 06:54.592
All right,so the score was tie kitty swore up and down

06:54.616 --> 06:57.260
that she knew the answer to the final trivia question,

06:57.286 --> 07:00.781
only she didn't and we lost.

07:00.805 --> 07:03.421
It was a stupid game. You know,everybody--

07:03.445 --> 07:07.371
you all reacted as if I-I missed the final field goal in the super bowl.

07:07.395 --> 07:08.100
-yeah.

07:08.127 --> 07:09.123
Kitty,sweetheart,

07:09.148 --> 07:14.373
no one would have blamed you had you not insisted vehemently that you knew the answer.

07:14.398 --> 07:16.953
-I...
-yeah. What was that question?

07:16.977 --> 07:19.823
Mm,something to do with president gerald ford?

07:19.857 --> 07:23.412
Well,you know,sarah,no,I honestly don't recall.

07:23.906 --> 07:27.100
Wait. Was that the night that kitty threw the trophy at your head?

07:27.127 --> 07:29.261
Yeah,that was it--12 stitches.

07:29.288 --> 07:30.930
Mm. No,it was 6.Six stitches...

07:30.955 --> 07:32.880
-well,I...
-and I-I tossed it to you..

07:32.907 --> 07:35.051
-threw it.
-And you just somehow couldn't catch it.

07:35.077 --> 07:35.841
That was a toss?

07:35.857 --> 07:36.821
Yeah. And you know what?

07:36.848 --> 07:41.802
You all secretly thank me for ending that ridiculous game night tradition forever.

07:41.828 --> 07:44.003
I'm gonna go get us some wine.

07:44.067 --> 07:45.271
No way in hell.

07:45.297 --> 07:46.640
I don't do blind dates.

07:46.668 --> 07:48.663
Oh,I promise,he's completely your type.

07:48.685 --> 07:50.761
Oh,what,attractive and emotionally unavailable?

07:50.786 --> 07:53.222
-Uh,no,that would be you.
-Oh,yeah.

07:53.246 --> 07:55.320
Where did you meet him?

07:55.648 --> 07:57.463
A mutual friend.

07:57.488 --> 07:59.240
I don't like your friends.What are you doing?

07:59.266 --> 08:01.273
I'm programming his number into your phone.

08:01.298 --> 08:04.241
You--you already know four jasons?

08:04.267 --> 08:06.241
Yeah,C.G.N.--

08:07.025 --> 08:09.912
Common gay name--only outdone by ryan and phillip.

08:09.935 --> 08:12.081
You are so weird.

08:13.805 --> 08:16.720
Okay... jason M.

08:17.248 --> 08:19.301
And you haveo call him,because I already told him that you would,

08:19.327 --> 08:21.651
and if you don't,he's gonna think I'm a jerk.

08:21.676 --> 08:23.750
Better him than me.

08:23.825 --> 08:25.861
Even minus the turkey,

08:25.888 --> 08:28.453
it's the company that makes the holiday meal.

08:28.737 --> 08:31.213
I have to say that I am so happy that were all here,

08:31.236 --> 08:32.903
everyone, under the same roof.

08:32.924 --> 08:34.822
-Thanks,saul.
-Thank you,saul.

08:34.846 --> 08:36.883
-Not everyone.
-Justin.

08:36.908 --> 08:38.162
I'm just saying,we could have invited her.

08:38.188 --> 08:39.643
Not rebecca again.

08:39.667 --> 08:40.773
You know,excuse me,sarah

08:40.796 --> 08:44.403
but since you' the one who started this by blabbing our family secrets,

08:44.426 --> 08:45.741
maybe you could include her.

08:45.757 --> 08:49.041
Oh,what are you suggesting I do,call her up

08:49.068 --> 08:50.461
and invite her to lunch

08:50.488 --> 08:52.260
is that so difficult?She's our sister.

08:52.285 --> 08:53.301
Half.

08:53.327 --> 08:55.301
I don't see why I'm the only one getting this lecture.

08:55.325 --> 08:57.033
Far be it from me to butt in,

08:57.058 --> 09:00.690
but I do think it would mean a lot to her.

09:01.058 --> 09:03.150
-Tommy?
-Yeah?

09:03.638 --> 09:06.351
Uh,yeah,all right. Fine.

09:06.376 --> 09:08.432
Kitty will never agree to this.

09:08.458 --> 09:09.200
Mm. You're right.

09:09.228 --> 09:10.381
You know,when i go off to iraq,

09:10.408 --> 09:13.031
she is gonna have no ties with this family,okay?

09:13.058 --> 09:15.001
Somebody's gonna have to reach out to her.

09:15.016 --> 09:16.662
Justin,just don'T.

09:16.687 --> 09:19.910
Don't use our fears about you going to war to 
get us to embrace some stranger.

09:19.937 --> 09:21.533
She's not a stranger,kitty!

09:21.556 --> 09:24.872
Well,she is to me and I'm gonna keep it that way.

09:28.077 --> 09:29.503
anybody want some more wine?

09:29.528 --> 09:30.700
-Me.
-Me.

09:31.756 --> 09:34.940
Brothers and Sisters 119
"Game Night"

09:39.705 --> 09:41.552
-hello?
-Rebecca,hey,

09:41.577 --> 09:43.571
it's sarah whedon.

09:44.678 --> 09:48.503
-Walker?
-Oh,hey,sarah.How are you?

09:48.586 --> 09:53.931
Uh,listen,I know we got off to a rocky start with our,um...

09:53.956 --> 09:55.942
it's hard to know what to call it,isn't it?

09:55.968 --> 09:59.750
Yeah. So I-I thought we should get together.

09:59.788 --> 10:02.361
If you're free tonight,there's this great new teahouse in westwood.

10:02.386 --> 10:03.693
It's supposed to be very hip,

10:03.718 --> 10:05.462
and tea's the new coffee and all that.

10:05.488 --> 10:08.012
Uh,as long as it's before midnight.

10:08.036 --> 10:11.173
Midnight?Oh,god,I so need your life.

10:11.195 --> 10:15.352
-Um,how's 7:00?
-Yeah,that sounds great.

10:15.375 --> 10:16.972
-Okay,great.
-Bye.

10:19.516 --> 10:22.312
-hello?
-Hi,uh,rebecca,it's kevin... walker.

10:22.336 --> 10:24.023
Oh. Hi.

10:24.065 --> 10:29.091
Look,um,I-I know you only know me as a demented hair yanker,

10:29.116 --> 10:32.220
but I can actually appear to be quite normal sometimes

10:32.255 --> 10:35.571
-I'm sure.
-I--so I was wondering if--

10:35.597 --> 10:37.220
if you'd want to get together sometimes,you know,

10:37.247 --> 10:40.453
maybe go see a movie-- uh,someplace public,of course,

10:40.478 --> 10:42.020
so you don't have to feel scared.

10:42.047 --> 10:43.890
Uh,wait. You want to take me to a movie?

10:43.918 --> 10:46.600
Yeah,yeah. Uh,there's a great documentary at the arclight.

10:46.628 --> 10:48.491
It's,um,it's--it's about meerkats.

10:48.516 --> 10:50.190
You know,they're fascinating animals.

10:52.045 --> 10:53.161
and--and they all have names.

10:53.188 --> 10:56.880
It's--it's really--I'm scaring you again,aren't I?

10:56.917 --> 10:58.252
Can I get back to you?

10:58.278 --> 10:59.262
Yeah,sure,absolutely.

10:59.288 --> 11:02.010
Look,I'm about to go into court,so can I call you back?

11:07.668 --> 11:09.203
this is a walker,isn't it?

11:09.226 --> 11:11.022
Uh,yeah. It's tommy.

11:11.055 --> 11:13.961
Uh,julia and I wanted to have you over for dinner.

11:13.985 --> 11:17.881
You know,it would save me a lot of time if we just did this all at once.

11:17.907 --> 11:19.323
Sorry lunch was so short.

11:19.348 --> 11:25.023
No! I am happy to gobble down a sandwich in 15 minutes

11:25.047 --> 11:28.420
if it means getting even a little quality time with my girl.

11:28.445 --> 11:30.142
Yeah. Mom,we live together.

11:30.168 --> 11:31.900
Oh,yes,well--

11:33.695 --> 11:36.252
Nora and kitty!Oh,my god.

11:36.276 --> 11:37.540
Wow. Mrs. Jones.

11:37.566 --> 11:39.213
Kitty? I don't believe it!

11:39.407 --> 11:43.500
-Lizzie,hi!
-Wow,wow. Lizzie,lizzie,look at you.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.310
-Lizzie!
-I know.

11:45.335 --> 11:46.833
"Oops,I did it again."

11:48.916 --> 11:51.283
she's following in our footsteps,nora--five children.

11:51.306 --> 11:52.852
This is number five.

11:52.877 --> 11:55.440
Five? Five? Are you kidding me? Five,really?

11:55.466 --> 11:57.461
Wow,that is--five just seemed so normal

11:57.488 --> 11:58.541
when we were growing up...

11:58.565 --> 12:02.001
But now it just seems so surreal.

12:02.028 --> 12:04.710
Oh,well,it helps when you have a great husband.

12:04.737 --> 12:08.913
Ken,ken--a prominent surgeon, spectacular father.

12:08.936 --> 12:11.020
Oh,my. Did you ever meet him,kitty?

12:11.047 --> 12:11.743
Uh-huh. Well--

12:11.767 --> 12:13.971
mom,ken and kitty used to date in high school.

12:15.528 --> 12:17.383
-You did?
-Yeah,yeah.

12:17.405 --> 12:18.480
Just--just briefly.

12:18.507 --> 12:20.243
-How long?-For what? Like,it was...

12:20.267 --> 12:22.031
it was...maybe three--

12:22.057 --> 12:24.072
two.Two and a half years,maybe.

12:24.346 --> 12:26.001
Oh,year--whoa!

12:26.015 --> 12:29.752
She's--she's--she's seeing a senator--the senator--mccallister.

12:29.777 --> 12:31.862
Oh,mom,shush.

12:31.885 --> 12:33.890
I could have sworn...he was married.

12:33.918 --> 12:35.472
oh,ll,he used to be.

12:35.495 --> 12:36.920
Was. No more.

12:36.948 --> 12:38.342
Oh,good.

12:38.365 --> 12:39.412
Well,you've got him now.

12:39.436 --> 12:40.482
That's the important thing.

12:40.506 --> 12:41.223
yes.

12:41.248 --> 12:43.313
so you know what? Um,yeah--

12:43.337 --> 12:44.722
when gerald ford died,

12:44.746 --> 12:46.923
we were all gathered around the tv for the funeral service...

12:46.957 --> 12:48.821
The whole family...that was so sad.

12:48.848 --> 12:51.222
I couldn't even look at betty ford without crying.

12:51.257 --> 12:52.540
I never could.

12:52.567 --> 12:56.970
Oh,we were all just weeping,and then somebody brought up game night...

12:56.998 --> 12:58.722
when--when you--when you...

12:58.758 --> 13:01.550
When--when kitty missed the question about gerald ford...

13:01.575 --> 13:02.242
right. I remember.

13:02.265 --> 13:04.721
And we all just burst into laughter.

13:04.806 --> 13:07.800
Oh,god,that was so--do you remember?you were so funny.

13:07.828 --> 13:11.040
you were so sure you had the right answer!

13:11.987 --> 13:14.123
you should've seen your face.

13:14.146 --> 13:15.240
Very funny.

13:15.266 --> 13:17.102
It was,wasn't it?

13:17.568 --> 13:20.170
You know,and I'll tell you what,after that,the funeral just wasn't so sad.

13:20.198 --> 13:21.600
You just--you just cheered us right up.

13:21.625 --> 13:22.792
Oh,yeah,we stopped crying.

13:22.815 --> 13:24.670
Oh,good,good,good.

13:24.697 --> 13:26.160
Well,yeah,no,I'm glad I could help.

13:26.187 --> 13:28.570
You know,I ally miss those game nights. Don't you,mom?

13:28.748 --> 13:30.011
You know,we should do it again.

13:30.036 --> 13:30.541
Really?

13:30.558 --> 13:32.840
Oh,absolutely,absolutely.How about tomorrow?

13:32.865 --> 13:34.281
I think I can get the family together.

13:34.306 --> 13:35.102
Yeah,yeah,mm-hmm.

13:35.127 --> 13:35.731
Kenny's available.

13:35.756 --> 13:36.702
Great,great.

13:37.117 --> 13:39.540
Tomorrow,our house. How about 7:00? Can you make 7:00?

13:39.565 --> 13:41.352
-7:00. Yeah.
-That'll do. Yeah!

13:41.376 --> 13:42.602
7:00 it is.

13:42.625 --> 13:44.181
We'll just see you then.

13:47.707 --> 13:49.951
Okay,I never really had brothers and sisters,

13:49.975 --> 13:52.603
so I don't know how big families work.

13:52.628 --> 13:55.252
Um,maybe this is the normal thing to do.

13:55.276 --> 13:58.282
You know,you just do things in a clump--

13:58.305 --> 14:00.521
like,you all get together,solve problems--

14:00.548 --> 14:01.313
no. Nono,no.

14:01.336 --> 14:03.601
We tend to make things worse and then blame each other.

14:03.628 --> 14:06.381
Yeah,that's pretty much how it works,so...

14:06.407 --> 14:08.681
Anyhow,I-I appreciate you guys trying to include me,

14:08.707 --> 14:10.453
but it's just feeling a little bit forced,

14:10.477 --> 14:13.263
like I'm--I'm a chore on your to-do list,you know?

14:13.285 --> 14:18.122
"Go pick up the dry-cleaning, make connection with half,illegitimate sister becca."

14:18.147 --> 14:20.973
It--maybe we could all just chill out a little bit.

14:20.996 --> 14:23.821
Okay,this is partially my fault,probably.

14:23.846 --> 14:24.643
Partially?

14:24.665 --> 14:27.761
Hey! Hey! Oh,my gosh,I can't believe you're all here.

14:27.786 --> 14:29.651
Um,this is perfect. You're never gonna believe this.

14:29.676 --> 14:31.722
You're never gonna believe who I ran into.

14:31.746 --> 14:34.973
Mom and I ran into lizzie and miranda jones at lunch,

14:34.998 --> 14:38.192
and they started yapping on about old game night days

14:38.216 --> 14:41.290
and about w they used to kick our butts on a regular basis.

14:41.317 --> 14:43.011
But it really got my goat,so I said,

14:43.036 --> 14:47.701
"okay,okay,fine. FinE.Rematch tomorrow night."

14:47.807 --> 14:51.101
You're never gonna believe what I got.

14:51.708 --> 14:53.230
Oh,what is it?

14:53.257 --> 14:56.993
What--what...what are you guys all doing here in the middle of the day,anyway?

15:03.138 --> 15:06.861
Kitty,this is... rebecca.

15:12.426 --> 15:15.011
It's really nice to meet you.

15:15.637 --> 15:19.580
Oh. Looks like justin set up a little ambush here.

15:19.606 --> 15:22.073
No,kitty,look,I swear,we thought you were working.

15:22.098 --> 15:26.572
Yeah. Yeah,so,uh...

15:26.597 --> 15:28.390
what are you guys doing?

15:28.416 --> 15:30.113
Uh,we're just,um,you know--

15:30.137 --> 15:32.963
rebecca called a family meeting.

15:36.085 --> 15:41.051
Rebecca,I'm so sorry that--that this is...so awkward.

15:41.526 --> 15:42.453
That's--that's all right.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.920
I'm getting used to it.

15:44.948 --> 15:46.102
I think I'll go.

15:46.126 --> 15:47.461
No.No! You don't--

15:47.488 --> 15:52.802
you know,I'm,um...I really am sorry.

15:55.425 --> 15:59.650
Wow. Wow. I didn'T...

15:59.676 --> 16:03.050
I didn't expect you to look so much like my dad.

16:03.875 --> 16:06.500
Yeah,I hear he was a great guy.

16:17.097 --> 16:19.182
-hello?
-Hey,rebecca,it's sarah.

16:19.207 --> 16:20.341
Sarah,hi.

16:20.365 --> 16:24.281
Um,listen...I just had an absolutely genuine,totally unforced,

16:24.316 --> 16:29.602
100% organic desire to call you to see if you wanted to come over for grilled cheese.

16:29.636 --> 16:32.611
I think it's time you met your niece and nephew.

16:32.977 --> 16:35.153
You can't make him pink.Dinosaurs aren't pink.

16:35.178 --> 16:36.952
She's a girl dinosaur.

16:40.255 --> 16:42.171
-There you go.
-Thank you.

16:42.198 --> 16:43.511
You're welcome.

16:45.496 --> 16:48.021
Wow,that's a gorgeous guitar.Is that yours?

16:48.045 --> 16:49.911
No,my husband'S.

16:49.937 --> 16:50.780
Can I...

16:50.808 --> 16:53.152
oh,sure,go ahead.

16:53.805 --> 16:55.423
-Do you play?
-Barely.

16:55.448 --> 16:56.942
I was in this,um,

16:56.966 --> 17:00.540
this silly garage band back in chicago for a while.

17:00.567 --> 17:01.553
I was the chick singer,

17:01.576 --> 17:03.000
and I never really knew what to do with my hands,

17:03.028 --> 17:08.000
so I picked up a guitar and learned enough chords to fake it,but that's about it.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.260
Well,you should take it up again.

17:09.287 --> 17:10.800
Yeah,I need to get a guitar first.

17:10.816 --> 17:13.001
Joe has,like,20 of them in storage.

17:13.015 --> 17:15.369
I'm sure he would lend you one.

17:15.817 --> 17:18.530
here you go,guys, chocolate fudge. Oh!

17:20.517 --> 17:24.583
Joe,this is,uh...rebecca.

17:26.568 --> 17:28.170
The rebecca?

17:28.196 --> 17:31.260
I'm sorry.I was,um... sorry.

17:31.286 --> 17:33.771
No,no,no,no,no.You go ahead.

17:33.798 --> 17:35.930
Rebecca was telling me that she was in a band.

17:35.955 --> 17:37.470
Cool.

17:37.495 --> 17:38.843
Joe's a guitar teacher.

17:38.865 --> 17:40.301
Oh,no way!

17:40.325 --> 17:42.970
Mm-hmm. There's a discount for,uh,family members.

17:42.995 --> 17:45.891
Or we're always looking for a good babysitter,

17:45.915 --> 17:48.390
-so if it's a fair quid pro quo--
-seriously?

17:48.418 --> 17:50.740
Sure. You can start tonight.It's game night.

17:50.767 --> 17:52.680
Yeah,I already booked natalie for sitting.

17:52.706 --> 17:53.331
-Oh,you did?
-Yeah.

17:53.357 --> 17:54.300
Oh,thanks for that.

17:54.326 --> 17:56.830
Yeah. How'd you get out of game night?

17:56.855 --> 18:00.033
Uh,I don't think kitty's really ready to have me there.

18:00.055 --> 18:01.622
That's not very nice of kitty,is it?

18:03.467 --> 18:06.922
You should be there.You should come.

18:06.947 --> 18:07.763
On blind dates,

18:07.788 --> 18:10.503
I generally just leave my car idling at the curb.

18:10.558 --> 18:12.330
Smart. Or better yet,

18:12.357 --> 18:16.001
have a--have a friend call your cell phone like 15 minutes into the date.

18:16.025 --> 18:18.510
If the guy's a zero,you just,I don't know,

18:18.537 --> 18:19.811
pretend there's been a terrible accident,

18:19.838 --> 18:21.743
make your excuse and go to the hospital.

18:22.278 --> 18:24.790
Wow. Yeah,that--that's not obvious at all.

18:24.815 --> 18:29.362
Right? You know,I--I almost didn't call you.

18:29.388 --> 18:31.602
Yeah? Why not?

18:31.626 --> 18:33.970
A fix-up by my republican sister?

18:33.997 --> 18:36.050
Apparently she had some of the robert mccallister kool-aid.

18:36.075 --> 18:38.722
Yeah. Yeah,she's relentless.

18:38.745 --> 18:40.403
Did,uh,did she hit you up to work for him?

18:40.427 --> 18:42.540
No. No,no,I got myself off the hook.

18:42.566 --> 18:46.101
I make it a rule never to work for anyone who isn't as smart as I am.

18:46.126 --> 18:48.100
I am so glad to hear you say that.

18:48.126 --> 18:49.480
"Hi,I'm robert mccallister.

18:49.495 --> 18:52.183
I used to drive a helicopter.Vote for me."

18:53.108 --> 18:54.531
I gather you're not a fan.

18:54.556 --> 18:57.691
Well,let's see,there's the neanderthal position on gay marriage.

18:57.715 --> 18:59.703
To be fair,he did admit he was wrong on that.

18:59.727 --> 19:02.952
Yeah,after the vote,which kind of makes him a weasel in my book.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.832
How'd you get so cynical?

19:04.858 --> 19:07.001
Well,what other response is there,you know?

19:07.025 --> 19:09.653
The guy's a mental midget,like you said.

19:09.676 --> 19:11.102
No,I didn'T.

19:11.126 --> 19:14.962
Okay,well,whatever it is you did say.I thought you said he was dumb.

19:17.308 --> 19:20.700
Okay. You know,I've had,like, three double shot lattes,

19:20.727 --> 19:24.061
so I may be having a teensy case of caffeine rage at the moment.

19:24.087 --> 19:26.283
You have to admit robert mccallister and his ilk,

19:26.305 --> 19:28.953
kind of what's wrong with this country.

19:30.738 --> 19:32.852
Mm. Got a call coming in.

19:32.877 --> 19:34.252
I didn't hear it ring.

19:34.277 --> 19:36.603
It's on vibrate.Oh,excuse me.

19:36.626 --> 19:39.270
Hospital calling.

19:39.297 --> 19:41.490
There's been an accident?

19:42.605 --> 19:43.502
Wow,I've gotta go.

19:43.526 --> 19:44.951
What? Whoa,whoa. Have I--

19:44.975 --> 19:47.150
I'm sorry,did I offend you?

19:47.575 --> 19:49.122
You take care.

19:52.757 --> 19:55.293
whoa,roger got fat.

19:55.318 --> 19:57.172
I played high school football with him.

19:57.195 --> 19:58.703
He lettered all four years.

19:58.728 --> 20:00.310
I thought you used to carry his jock.

20:00.338 --> 20:01.560
Yeah,that's funny.

20:01.587 --> 20:04.841
Oh,look,there's your classmate doug jones.

20:04.868 --> 20:06.371
Didn't he invent that web site?

20:06.395 --> 20:08.123
Doyouwannadome.Com.

20:08.148 --> 20:10.283
Yeah,he's probably getting a lot of that right now.

20:10.307 --> 20:12.113
He's worth millions.

20:12.136 --> 20:14.562
Here. Put these on quick.

20:15.026 --> 20:16.792
oh,god,this smells like attic.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.473
I think somebody used this to wax the car.

20:18.497 --> 20:20.430
I didn't have time to wash them.

20:20.458 --> 20:23.112
How on earth did they get t-shirts made in one day?

20:23.135 --> 20:25.173
Mom,clearly,they're not human.

20:25.198 --> 20:26.281
Sorry,mom.

20:26.306 --> 20:27.220
See,you're not wearing one either.

20:27.245 --> 20:30.373
No,I,um,couldn't get it over my boobs.

20:30.395 --> 20:32.120
That's what happens when you have two kids.

20:32.146 --> 20:32.852
All right.

20:32.875 --> 20:35.433
-sorry.
-Fine. Fine.

20:35.438 --> 20:38.742
Uh,apparently stephanie's had 12 kids.

20:38.768 --> 20:40.222
Oh,there is no way they're real.

20:40.248 --> 20:42.112
I don't care.

20:42.137 --> 20:44.001
She did not have them in high school.

20:44.015 --> 20:45.431
Still not caring.

20:47.888 --> 20:50.582
-oh,sweetie,you remember donna?
-Sure.

20:50.838 --> 20:54.520
Donna and her partner were--were married recently in a civil union.

20:54.548 --> 20:55.761
We sent you an announcement.

20:55.786 --> 20:57.760
Yeah. I--yeah,I got it.Congratulations.

20:57.787 --> 21:00.772
I haven'seen you at any of the H.R.C. Meetings lately...

21:00.796 --> 21:02.623
no,uh,no,I've been kind of busy.

21:02.646 --> 21:06.432
Or the gay task force meetings or the G.L.S.E.N. Fund-raiser last month

21:06.458 --> 21:07.701
or the G.L.A.A.D. Dinner last week--

21:07.728 --> 21:09.183
you know why? It's because I'm not as gay as you,donna.

21:09.206 --> 21:10.133
Could I talk to you for a second?

21:10.156 --> 21:11.963
-Yes. Excuse us.
-Sorry.

21:12.826 --> 21:16.040
Didn't you and donna use to date in high school?

21:16.066 --> 21:20.970
We were each other's beards at junior prom...

21:20.995 --> 21:21.732
Which only went slightly better than the blind date kitty set me up on today.

21:21.758 --> 21:24.063
-Where is she?
-Upstairs trying on all the clothes in her closet.

21:24.088 --> 21:25.773
How hard is it to dress for charades?

21:25.797 --> 21:27.550
Well,for kitty,it's--it's--it's hard. She--

21:27.575 --> 21:29.663
where's kitty?

21:29.685 --> 21:32.120
Senator mccallister is here.

21:32.146 --> 21:33.573
He's so gorgeous.

21:33.597 --> 21:34.153
I know.

21:34.175 --> 21:35.781
I can't believe kitty is dating him.

21:35.808 --> 21:36.803
Yes,she is.

21:36.826 --> 21:38.282
Oh... let's--

21:40.047 --> 21:42.940
She invited mccallister to game night? My god.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.891
Still trying to show up lizzie jones

21:44.917 --> 21:46.110
that she has the better boyfriend?

21:46.135 --> 21:47.673
It was my idea.

21:47.697 --> 21:50.122
Mom,why don't you and miranda jones get down on the floor and wrestle?

21:50.148 --> 21:52.492
It'd make life so much easier and faster for the rest of us.

21:52.516 --> 21:54.891
Don't be silly. Let's go watch them look at him.

21:55.918 --> 21:57.551
-Just tuck in your shirt.
-All right!

21:57.658 --> 21:59.720
Interesting fashion,but...that's true.

22:00.087 --> 22:01.713
Nora.

22:01.787 --> 22:03.862
Senator,so nice to see you.

22:04.126 --> 22:05.470
You've met lizzie and miranda.

22:05.496 --> 22:06.921
Oh,yes.Yes,we just met.

22:06.946 --> 22:08.072
Wonderful. I'm so glad.

22:08.095 --> 22:09.232
Oh,hello there.

22:09.258 --> 22:10.700
This is--this is ken.

22:10.725 --> 22:12.392
He's,uh,lizzie's husband.

22:12.415 --> 22:13.530
Ken baker,M.D.

22:13.557 --> 22:14.471
Nice to meet you,senator.

22:14.498 --> 22:16.452
Oh,well,great to meet you.

22:17.668 --> 22:20.672
Robert.

22:21.207 --> 22:24.120
Oh,hello,my darling.

22:25.408 --> 22:28.910
Kitty?Kitty? Kitty? Kitty?

22:28.935 --> 22:31.022
I just got off the phone with my brother jason.

22:31.058 --> 22:32.950
Oh. No,no,no. No,no.

22:32.977 --> 22:34.390
This is not the time for that.

22:34.416 --> 22:36.240
What? That'S...

22:36.266 --> 22:37.460
you--you didn'T. No.

22:37.486 --> 22:39.310
You--you didn't do that.

22:39.337 --> 22:41.583
-Oh. Okay,it--
-I'm sorry.

22:43.498 --> 22:44.560
Please tell me you didn'T.

22:44.588 --> 22:47.593
Yes,kevin,it seems that she fixed you up with my brother,

22:47.615 --> 22:52.082
unbeknownst to both of us,and apparently,it did not go well.

22:52.108 --> 22:53.453
Yeah,you could say that.

22:53.478 --> 22:55.791
Really? Well,wh-what happened?

22:55.816 --> 22:57.363
I don't know. He didn't want to talk about it.

22:57.385 --> 22:59.371
He didn't want to cause trouble.

23:00.026 --> 23:02.102
Okay,look,I'm--I'm sorry,okay?

23:02.128 --> 23:03.921
But could we just table this,please?

23:03.945 --> 23:08.583
I'm gonna get something to eat and yotwo can happily...strangle each other.

23:09.565 --> 23:11.213
-Know what?
-No. Calm dowN.

23:11.247 --> 23:17.670
I told you months ago I did not want to meet his stupid gay brother.

23:17.695 --> 23:18.701
Yes,you are right.

23:18.727 --> 23:20.072
I am gonna kill you.

23:20.095 --> 23:21.041
-Kevin--
-I'm gonna kill you.

23:21.065 --> 23:23.580
No,I'm not.I'm beyond that,okay?

23:23.605 --> 23:25.042
You're dead to me.

23:29.538 --> 23:31.322
Rebecca,hI.It's great to see you.

23:31.347 --> 23:33.333
Sorry. I hope I'm not late.

23:39.425 --> 23:40.670
nora,who is that?

23:40.768 --> 23:44.132
Oh,don't tell me,you brought in a ringer.

23:45.315 --> 23:48.620
no. Acally,that's william's illegitimate daughter,

23:48.657 --> 23:50.623
my children's half sister rebecca.

23:50.657 --> 23:53.031
Rebecca,hello!Lovely girl.

23:54.805 --> 23:56.500
Well,we don't have one of those.

23:58.558 --> 24:00.523
One of you is gonna have to sit out a round.

24:01.158 --> 24:02.400
Oh. Well,that's fine,miranda,

24:02.425 --> 24:08.201
so long as you don't mind my family kicking your family's sorry ass into the middle of next week.

24:08.225 --> 24:10.221
Would you care for a buffalo wing?

24:15.158 --> 24:20.020
it is indeed my pleasure to take over for william as your host tonight for game night.

24:22.568 --> 24:23.582
where's kitty?

24:23.605 --> 24:25.473
Didn't she put this whole stupid thing together?

24:25.495 --> 24:28.410
Well,I think she's in the kitchen begging mccallister not to leave.

24:28.436 --> 24:29.550
As the current champion,

24:29.576 --> 24:32.340
the joneses have the right to choose the games for tonight.

24:32.366 --> 24:36.421
And keeping with tradition,they've chosen to open with charades.

24:37.746 --> 24:40.712
And they're going to end with trivia.

24:40.737 --> 24:44.151
But there were some very unusual choices for the middle games,you see.

24:44.176 --> 24:46.301
-They are--
-twister and operation!

24:50.125 --> 24:52.001
are you kidding me?What are we,12?

24:52.018 --> 24:53.002
I'm not doing this.

24:53.027 --> 24:54.150
Yes,you are.Yes,you are.

24:54.177 --> 24:55.773
Come on,mom. We've gotta give 'em one of these.

24:56.457 --> 25:02.162
walker!Walker!......Walker! Go,walkers!

25:02.537 --> 25:04.690
Oh,my god.

25:04.716 --> 25:08.400
The women in this family are really starting to scare me.

25:08.455 --> 25:10.560
movie!Four words.

25:10.587 --> 25:13.660
First word... sounds like...sister. Mister.

25:13.685 --> 25:14.922
woman.Female.Trickster!

25:14.958 --> 25:17.153
Backstabber! Shrew!

25:17.616 --> 25:19.691
-Kevin walker!
-No talking,nora.

25:19.718 --> 25:21.513
kitty!Kitty! Uh,kitty!

25:21.538 --> 25:22.911
Kitty,sounds like kitty.

25:22.938 --> 25:23.960
Fitty! Fitty cent!

25:23.987 --> 25:25.650
second word.Second word.

25:26.008 --> 25:28.503
Soun like... Gritty?Gritty? Mitty?Kitty.

25:28.535 --> 25:30.201
third word.Third word.

25:30.467 --> 25:32.962
Shooting. Murder.Die,kitty,die!

25:36.235 --> 25:39.213
-Whatever.
-Rifle. Bang!

25:39.246 --> 25:40.730
"Chitty chitty bang bang"!

25:44.077 --> 25:46.241
walker! Walker!

25:49.437 --> 25:50.320
book.book.

25:50.345 --> 25:51.620
Whole idea.

25:51.637 --> 25:53.121
"All quiet on the western front."

25:53.146 --> 25:55.642
-Yes!
-what?

26:00.127 --> 26:04.091
okay,tommy.Tommy,come on. Go,tommy!

26:05.686 --> 26:06.802
movie. Movies.

26:06.828 --> 26:08.322
Two words. Two words.

26:08.357 --> 26:09.872
Monster.

26:09.896 --> 26:11.721
-"frankenstein."
-the incredible hulk."

26:11.758 --> 26:12.632
"Razorback"!

26:12.658 --> 26:14.580
"bride of frankenstein"!

26:15.327 --> 26:16.071
"night of the living dead"!

26:16.098 --> 26:17.433
a monster. Monster!

26:17.457 --> 26:18.893
"creature

26:23.067 --> 26:25.562
"Jaws"! "Jaws"!

26:26.938 --> 26:28.371
do something else!

26:28.398 --> 26:29.923
Time's up. Time's up.

26:31.528 --> 26:32.322
(Sarah) what was it?

26:32.348 --> 26:34.232
A dinosaur."Jurassic park."

26:34.235 --> 26:36.923
What? That was a dinosaur?

26:37.847 --> 26:41.040
that's a dinosaur. that's a dinosaur!

26:41.057 --> 26:44.850
for christ sakes,you could have done "park,"you know,rhymes with.

26:44.876 --> 26:48.170
What was the "jurassic"? There'slots of things you could do.Or "park."

26:48.198 --> 26:50.192
"Park," we could have done...

26:53.487 --> 26:55.710
havin' fun?

26:57.578 --> 26:58.091
I don't know.

26:58.116 --> 27:00.663
When I'm around all of them,it's just like...

27:00.688 --> 27:04.021
they got this whole rhythm thing going on, and you're the extra beat.

27:04.047 --> 27:05.820
Spoken like a true musician.

27:05.848 --> 27:08.593
Or someone who's spent a lot of time with the walkers.

27:13.357 --> 27:15.380
What kind of music do you like?

27:16.137 --> 27:21.363
Um,alt. Rock,a little jazz,if it's not too fusiony.

27:21.388 --> 27:23.371
I don't know. I pretty much like everything except rap.

27:23.398 --> 27:24.622
I can't stand rap.

27:24.655 --> 27:26.650
That's right.Now we're talkin'.

27:29.075 --> 27:32.712
Sarah mentioned to me that you don't even have a guitar of your own to practice on.

27:35.148 --> 27:38.002
I've got this,uh,little addiction problem.

27:38.086 --> 27:40.082
Sarah doesn't know about it.

27:41.068 --> 27:43.621
It's called guitar collecting.

27:44.736 --> 27:46.903
I hate to break it to you,but she knows about it.

27:46.967 --> 27:50.932
Nuh-unh. She doesn'T. She thinks I only have like 20 guitars.

27:52.417 --> 27:54.022
come on by the house.I'll let you borrow one.

27:54.045 --> 27:54.780
Really?

27:54.797 --> 27:56.540
I feel bad I don't have time to play them all.

27:56.568 --> 27:57.670
You'd be doing me a favor.

27:57.698 --> 27:59.020
Hardly,but okay.

27:59.045 --> 28:01.483
Sweet. It's a deal.

28:02.518 --> 28:04.673
right hand green.

28:07.815 --> 28:11.503
how come I get stuck playing operation with dr. Demento,

28:11.527 --> 28:13.550
and justin gets to do that?

28:13.578 --> 28:16.313
those things are rock-hard.He could get a concussion.

28:16.338 --> 28:18.702
left hand blue.

28:21.146 --> 28:22.582
"Die,kitty,die"?

28:22.605 --> 28:24.453
Yeah. It's a movie about a meddlesome cat

28:24.477 --> 28:27.201
who sticks her nose in where it doesn't belong and gets run over by a bus.

28:27.225 --> 28:29.671
Okay. Okay,kevin,all right,I'm sorry.

28:29.697 --> 28:32.253
My god,could you please just let it go?

28:32.267 --> 28:35.223
Hell no. You blithely push me into a situation

28:35.247 --> 28:37.401
where I unknowingly make a jackass of myself?

28:37.428 --> 28:39.533
Nuh-unh. You don't get to tell me when to get over it.

28:39.557 --> 28:42.490
Well,I think you're overreacting a bit.

28:42.515 --> 28:44.771
I trashed your boyfriend.

28:44.797 --> 28:46.103
What did you say?

28:46.126 --> 28:49.622
You know,phony neanderthal weasel who's ruined america,that kind of thing.

28:49.655 --> 28:51.212
Really? And is that what you really think?

28:51.237 --> 28:54.041
When I'm trying to impress an attractive man with my liberal cred,

28:54.068 --> 28:56.192
and I'm under the impression he agrees with me,yeah.

28:56.218 --> 28:57.253
All right.

28:57.278 --> 29:00.323
I've made my appearance,I've met all the joneses,

29:00.347 --> 29:01.683
and I've kept up with them.

29:01.708 --> 29:02.553
So I think I'm gonna go.

29:02.577 --> 29:04.412
Okay,wait,wait,just--just a second.

29:04.807 --> 29:08.533
Um,kevin has something that he wants to say.

29:08.558 --> 29:10.833
-Me?
-Well,yeah,okay,I.

29:10.858 --> 29:12.863
I would like to apologize for what I did,

29:12.886 --> 29:15.223
and kevin is gonna call jason tomorrow and apologize.

29:15.256 --> 29:17.242
No,don'T.

29:17.267 --> 29:19.290
My brother made it crystal clear to me

29:19.317 --> 29:20.550
that he doesn't ever want to see him again,

29:20.578 --> 29:23.543
and frankly,kevin,I'm inclined to agree with him.

29:23.568 --> 29:26.203
-Why?
-Go ahead,senator. Say it.

29:26.228 --> 29:28.943
No,say it.Say how you don't think I'm good enough for him.

29:30.816 --> 29:31.953
Okay,I don'T.

29:32.666 --> 29:34.652
Okay,just a second here.

29:34.677 --> 29:40.460
Uh,my brother kevin is smart and good and kind and generous

29:40.487 --> 29:42.173
-and thoughtful--
-handsome,don't forget handsome.

29:42.198 --> 29:43.171
And handsome--and handsome.

29:43.185 --> 29:44.173
Yes,he is handsome,and you know what?

29:44.198 --> 29:45.692
Jason happens to be a very nice boy,

29:45.717 --> 29:48.842
I'm sure,but frankly,I think kevin was slumming it a bit.

29:49.348 --> 29:50.743
Your apology is not working out very well,

29:50.765 --> 29:53.160
so I'm going to choose to ignore most of it,

29:53.186 --> 29:55.800
and,um,I will see you...Tomorrow.

29:55.827 --> 29:57.340
-Good night.
-Good night.

29:57.546 --> 29:59.260
-Bye,sah. Good to see you.
-Oh,you're leaving.

29:59.797 --> 30:01.370
Hey,has anyone seen joe?

30:03.357 --> 30:05.560
whoo! I just won my twister match against stephanie,

30:05.587 --> 30:07.332
and when I say "against,"I mean,like,

30:07.358 --> 30:11.162
my head was ag--what's the matter with you guys?

30:11.185 --> 30:13.250
I don't know. I just walked in to find joe,and...

30:13.635 --> 30:14.943
oh,joe's outside with rebecca.

30:14.967 --> 30:16.520
I think she feels a little left out.

30:16.548 --> 30:17.571
Oh,well,you know what,justin?

30:17.598 --> 30:20.061
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea to invite her to a family event

30:20.088 --> 30:21.903
where she's bound to feel like an outsider.

30:21.927 --> 30:24.243
Oh,justin didn't invite her. I did.

30:24.266 --> 30:25.920
Oh,well,uh,sarah,okay,

30:25.947 --> 30:27.652
ybe next time you could alert me

30:27.677 --> 30:29.660
when you're gonna inte somebody without asking me first?

30:29.688 --> 30:30.802
Yeah,sarah,

30:30.827 --> 30:34.200
it's so thoughtless not to tell kitty all the details of a social engagement.

30:34.218 --> 30:36.153
I mean,that's really rude.

30:36.728 --> 30:40.851
oh,hey,I just tied the score by beating that freakin' surgeon at operation,

30:40.876 --> 30:42.100
and you didn't even bother to watch.

30:42.125 --> 30:42.720
Sorry,bro.

30:42.746 --> 30:44.722
They're too tied up with their little personal problems.

30:44.745 --> 30:46.363
Oh,god,justin,please.

30:46.388 --> 30:49.373
Yeah,you know,for one minute,could you drop the superior attitude?

30:49.398 --> 30:50.223
You know what?

30:50.248 --> 30:52.382
I'm--I'm sorry if it seems a little petty to me,okay?

30:52.415 --> 30:55.473
-But maybe if you guys are getting called back to iraq--
-oh,stop using that!

30:55.498 --> 30:56.823
again! Again!

30:56.848 --> 30:58.623
-Listen,I'm not "ung" it!
-This is ridiculous!

30:58.957 --> 31:01.263
Quiet,quiet! Shh! Quiet!

31:01.285 --> 31:02.290
What is the matter with you?

31:02.315 --> 31:04.302
Everyone can hear you!What are you thinking?

31:04.328 --> 31:05.933
It's the enemy out there, not in here.

31:05.956 --> 31:07.723
We're supposed to be on the same side,

31:07.757 --> 31:09.601
not in here bickering with each other! What can you--

31:09.628 --> 31:11.151
-nora?
-yes!

31:11.175 --> 31:13.651
Hi. Uh,is everything all right in here?

31:13.675 --> 31:15.212
Oh,yes,fine.

31:15.235 --> 31:17.302
We're setting up for trivia.

31:19.267 --> 31:22.190
Yes,we're just--we're having a private team meeting,

31:22.216 --> 31:24.421
chalk talk,just discussing strategy.

31:24.455 --> 31:25.671
We can't let you hear!

31:25.697 --> 31:27.272
Oh,strategy.Cover your ears.

31:29.768 --> 31:32.002
I'll get you in a minute,yeah

31:32.055 --> 31:34.402
can you please tell me what the hell is going on in here?

31:34.428 --> 31:35.013
Sorry,mom.

31:35.038 --> 31:37.921
I'm trying to tell kitty if she scrapes off the icicles,

31:37.946 --> 31:40.020
she might actually like rebecca.

31:40.048 --> 31:44.661
I don't deserve that.I am not icicley.I am just careful,and you know what?

31:44.688 --> 31:47.041
You're just gonna have to forgive me if I am too tired

31:47.066 --> 31:50.941
of dealing with dad's mistakes to take the latest one out for tea.

31:52.265 --> 31:56.053
Enough.All right? Enough.

32:03.415 --> 32:04.760
Now listen to me.

32:04.787 --> 32:07.950
We have a serious round of trivia to play,

32:07.975 --> 32:11.363
and I'm telling you right now,if we do not win,

32:11.385 --> 32:14.680
then I will make you regret it for the rest of your lives,and you know that I can.

32:14.705 --> 32:18.941
So please,all of you...all of you...

32:18.956 --> 32:21.783
follow me,all of you.

32:21.808 --> 32:27.753
walkers. Walkers......

32:30.697 --> 32:32.622
-come on,daddy!
-Okay. Okay.

32:34.065 --> 32:39.460
"What is the medical term for the surgical procedure commonly known as a nose job?"

32:39.488 --> 32:41.353
-rhinoplasty!
-Correct!

32:42.785 --> 32:45.891
that's my girls--beautiful and smart.

32:46.485 --> 32:49.443
Okay,this is us.All right,do or die.Let's go.

32:51.078 --> 32:52.493
Everybody ready?

32:52.518 --> 32:55.271
Okay,"in william shakespeare's 'romeo and juliet,'

32:55.296 --> 32:59.510
what is the last name of the female title character?"

32:59.538 --> 33:00.363
Capulet.

33:00.388 --> 33:01.603
Capulet or montague.

33:01.627 --> 33:02.372
Capulet. It's capulet.

33:02.397 --> 33:04.022
Which one is it?

33:04.045 --> 33:05.941
Romeo is montague.Juliet is capulet.

33:05.967 --> 33:06.542
No,no.

33:06.568 --> 33:09.453
No mother would ever call her daughter juliet capulet.

33:09.475 --> 33:10.481
Right. I agree with sarah.

33:10.506 --> 33:12.300
No,no,no,no,no,no.I'm right.

33:12.317 --> 33:14.421
It's--it's shakespeare.Uh,you guys,

33:14.456 --> 33:16.170
please trust me. I'm right.

33:16.198 --> 33:20.473
Oh,I think we may be having a repeat of kitty's famous last finale.

33:20.495 --> 33:21.931
Yes,I think so!

33:21.957 --> 33:24.813
Oh,shut up,lizzie!

33:25.417 --> 33:28.121
I-I did the balcony scene in,um,acting class.

33:28.156 --> 33:29.953
Well,what is it?What is it?

33:29.976 --> 33:32.701
I don't know if I--I don't know if I remember,but,um...

33:32.725 --> 33:34.212
if you had to guess?If you had to guess?

33:34.236 --> 33:37.440
Breathe. No,no. Just take a deepreath and go very slow.

33:37.466 --> 33:39.562
-You can remember.
-Rebecca,capulet.It's capulet.

33:39.898 --> 33:42.061
I think it's montague.

33:42.087 --> 33:43.571
I'm sorry,kitty.

33:43.597 --> 33:46.282
Just... oh,god,it isn'T.You guys,it isn'T.

33:46.306 --> 33:47.472
Please trust me. Trust me!

33:47.496 --> 33:50.940
I know this!I know it's capulet.I know it. I know it.

33:50.965 --> 33:54.072
No,when you get competitive and stubborn, my red flags go up.

33:54.095 --> 33:55.173
I'm backing with rebecca.

33:55.196 --> 33:57.933
Look,we got a 50-50 shot.Rebecca's got a feeling.

33:57.956 --> 33:58.962
I think we should go with her.

33:58.986 --> 33:59.752
I'm going with rebecca.

33:59.777 --> 34:00.451
I can't believe it.

34:00.476 --> 34:04.811
All right. Rebecca,it's yours. Take it.

34:08.327 --> 34:11.703
Okay. Montague--final answer.

34:18.428 --> 34:20.239
capulet.

34:38.467 --> 34:42.591
jones! Jones! Jones! Jones!

34:55.525 --> 34:57.240
oh,rebecca,wait.

34:57.265 --> 34:59.651
I hope you don't feel bad about the game.

34:59.955 --> 35:02.921
I mean,please.I mean,you shouldn'T.

35:02.956 --> 35:06.402
That's funny,because whenever I'm around all of you,

35:06.428 --> 35:11.092
no matter what,I have this-- this urge to apologize,

35:11.115 --> 35:13.942
like I've somehow spoiled something,

35:13.967 --> 35:16.760
tonight hasn't changed that.

35:18.355 --> 35:21.231
Mm. No,you have nothing to apologize for.

35:23.197 --> 35:24.442
oh,and just so you know,

35:24.466 --> 35:29.171
you're--you're pretty much a--an amateur when it comes to losing game night.

35:29.198 --> 35:32.010
I--I'm not sure if justin told you about how--

35:32.037 --> 35:34.262
oh,he did? Of course he did.

35:34.288 --> 35:39.291
yeah,well,that was 10-plus years ago,and I'm still not over it.

35:39.318 --> 35:41.150
Well,that's kind of sick.

35:45.165 --> 35:49.951
So,um,my advice to you for...

35:50.418 --> 35:52.400
what it's worth...

35:59.396 --> 36:02.481
So did you have any fun at all tonight?

36:03.405 --> 36:04.422
no,not really.

36:04.446 --> 36:06.831
No? Me neither.

36:07.628 --> 36:10.001
Well,I-I've gotta meet some friends,so...

36:14.415 --> 36:17.132
Sarah said the same thing the other night...

36:17.156 --> 36:20.703
which is funny,because I want the one you guys had.

36:43.775 --> 36:45.343
Hey,I'm still reeling from the news

36:45.368 --> 36:46.830
that there are more than three chords.

36:46.858 --> 36:48.951
Well,you have nice,long fingers.

36:48.975 --> 36:51.072
You'll learn plenty of new riffs by the end of summer.

36:51.097 --> 36:54.171
Yeah,they kind of feel like giant sausages at the moment.

36:54.198 --> 36:56.153
You going back to school in the fall?

36:56.175 --> 36:58.871
Uh,no. I think I'm done with school...

36:58.895 --> 37:02.040
and chicago and the loser boyfriend.

37:02.068 --> 37:03.471
Three strikes and you're out.

37:03.495 --> 37:05.693
Well,the ex-boyfriend teaches at the school,

37:05.716 --> 37:07.652
-and the school is in chicago.
-Teaches?

37:07.677 --> 37:09.500
Yeah,yeah. He's older.

37:09.526 --> 37:11.880
A lot older,actually.

37:11.906 --> 37:14.423
How much older are we talking about?

37:14.625 --> 37:16.670
Uh,probably older than you.

37:16.695 --> 37:17.953
How old do you think I am?

37:17.975 --> 37:21.460
I don't know. 35?

37:22.048 --> 37:24.552
all right,let's just leave it at that.

37:24.575 --> 37:26.491
uh,have you recovered from last night?

37:26.515 --> 37:28.001
Yeah,yeah.You know,I mean--

37:28.015 --> 37:29.862
I mean,I can handle them individually.

37:29.885 --> 37:32.271
It's just when you get them all together--

37:32.295 --> 37:34.123
-they're like a force of nature.
-Yeah.

37:34.145 --> 37:37.253
I used to try and figure out that crazy family dynamic--

37:37.276 --> 37:40.292
who's mad at who,who knows what secret.

37:40.315 --> 37:41.591
I gave up.

37:41.616 --> 37:43.791
I think that they have some kind of gene mutation

37:43.815 --> 37:46.262
that--that won't let outsiders in.

37:46.288 --> 37:49.822
But,you know,to be fair,they're fantastic in a crisis.

37:49.845 --> 37:52.370
When paige was sick,they were incredible.

37:52.396 --> 37:53.501
It's when they're at their best.

37:53.525 --> 37:59.621
But the rub is,you have to be in a bad place to feel loved.

38:00.096 --> 38:04.832
Yeah,they were actually really sweet when I lost that game last night.

38:05.418 --> 38:07.602
Good.

38:07.666 --> 38:10.172
Just remember,if you ever feel intimidated,

38:10.195 --> 38:12.392
not one of them has a musical bone in their body.

38:12.708 --> 38:14.840
They're all tone-deaf.

38:15.165 --> 38:16.860
You just show 'em your f minor 9th.

38:16.885 --> 38:18.791
Wait. Which one is that?

38:18.815 --> 38:21.880
That one is...

38:23.476 --> 38:24.593
I thought this was cheating.

38:24.616 --> 38:28.621
Oh,yeah,it is,but there are only six people on the planet who can make this chord,

38:28.655 --> 38:33.820
so it's okay,and lucky... for you,I am one of them.

38:34.125 --> 38:35.922
All right.

38:38.476 --> 38:40.300
It was all right.

38:47.376 --> 38:50.122
william paid for that trophy,and I'm getting it back.

38:50.157 --> 38:51.291
I wish we had a dog.

38:51.317 --> 38:53.020
At least we'd look like we had a purpose.

38:53.046 --> 38:57.063
No,we're out for a lovely walk,nothing suspicious about that.

38:57.086 --> 38:59.763
"Children of the corn."

39:00.146 --> 39:05.622
Hi. I'm mrs. Walker,and this is ms. Walker.

39:05.645 --> 39:08.420
Hi. Hi. We're friends of your mommy'S.

39:08.446 --> 39:09.671
Is--is she home?

39:09.696 --> 39:12.271
Uh,she went to the store.

39:14.556 --> 39:17.133
And how about your grandmother,is she home?

39:17.156 --> 39:19.581
Yeah,she's taking a nap.You want me to go get her?

39:19.606 --> 39:21.231
No,no,no. Not necessary.

39:21.258 --> 39:22.893
We're just here to pick up our trophy.

39:22.917 --> 39:24.610
Do you happen to know where it is?

39:24.906 --> 39:27.100
-I know where it is!
-You do?

39:27.125 --> 39:28.520
Oh,well,that's wonderful!

39:28.556 --> 39:32.163
Can you run in there quick as a bunny and get it for us?

39:32.437 --> 39:34.283
Wait,gwyneth.

39:35.135 --> 39:36.603
I don't think we should.

39:37.766 --> 39:39.193
No,gwyneth,it's fine.

39:39.218 --> 39:41.753
It's fine. It's really fine.It's actually ours.

39:41.778 --> 39:43.871
Run,run,run,run!Faster! Faster!

39:43.898 --> 39:46.811
Quick as a little rabbit.A little rabbit woman,she is.

39:46.835 --> 39:50.152
-So,so,what's your name?
-Ken junior.

39:52.297 --> 39:53.661
I know your father.

39:53.686 --> 39:56.801
When we were in high school,he used to drink a lot of beer.

39:56.827 --> 39:58.320
does he still drink a lot of beer?

39:58.355 --> 39:59.851
-Kitty.
-What? What?

39:59.875 --> 40:01.540
I'm just chatting.

40:01.566 --> 40:03.683
What about your grandmother?She drinks a lot,doesn't she?

40:03.708 --> 40:06.203
Have you ever seen her with a whole lot of bandages all over her face?
