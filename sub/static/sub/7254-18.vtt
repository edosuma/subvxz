WEBVTT

00:01.920 --> 00:02.500
what are you doing?

00:02.600 --> 00:03.500
when?

00:03.500 --> 00:04.500
What?

00:05.100 --> 00:06.230
Michel, michel

00:06.230 --> 00:06.600
Michel, what?

00:06.601 --> 00:09.059
You can't put your
schedules in the front of the basket.

00:09.060 --> 00:10.285
It's blocking everything.

00:10.286 --> 00:11.024
so?

00:11.100 --> 00:14.400
So it shouldn't block
everything. It doesn't look good

00:14.400 --> 00:17.542
Yes, it does. I am a man of refine and renown

00:17.543 --> 00:20.292
. Aesthetic Fabien Baron once publicly admired

00:20.293 --> 00:22.116
the way I decorated my locker at crunch

00:22.240 --> 00:23.330
What?

00:23.330 --> 00:26.370
I worked extremely hard on
these schedules, and it looks good.

00:26.370 --> 00:28.285
Yes, the schedules look nice, okay.

00:28.286 --> 00:32.250
Lovely font choice, lovely use of
bullet points, but give me a break

00:32.250 --> 00:35.110
it's not like you made them
on an antique printing press or something.

00:35.110 --> 00:38.602
Oh! I'm sorry. Did you
make your chocolate-dipped

00:38.603 --> 00:40.780
apricots on an antique printing press?

00:40.780 --> 00:42.651
Ha ha. No, of course not.

00:42.686 --> 00:43.230
Touché.

00:43.330 --> 00:45.320
No, that's not a touché

00:45.320 --> 00:46.100
touchê

00:46.100 --> 00:47.400
touchê

00:47.400 --> 00:48.400
Tou-

00:49.800 --> 00:50.960
Leave it! leave it! leave it!

00:50.960 --> 00:52.640
Hi, guys. How are the baskets coming?

00:52.641 --> 00:53.590
Great.

00:53.620 --> 00:54.542
Yeah, just great.

00:54.543 --> 00:58.688
Wow. Looks like Mr. Crankypants
is in his usual spring-fling funk.

00:58.870 --> 00:59.750
I'm not in a funk.

00:59.751 --> 01:02.366
I wasn't talking about you,
I was talking about Mr. Crankypants.

01:03.010 --> 01:04.410
Hey, the schedule looks good.

01:04.480 --> 01:06.367
You should see his gym locker. Touché.

01:06.310 --> 01:08.600
Touché yourself.

01:08.600 --> 01:11.647
"Dance of the daffodils,
bingo, sack races, pie-eating... 

01:11.697 --> 01:14.792
bird-watching"? We didn't
schedule any bird-watching, did we?

01:14.793 --> 01:15.850
There was a void.

01:16.506 --> 01:18.758
On the schedule there was
nothing scheduled on Saturday evening.

01:18.759 --> 01:20.705
It looks ridiculous so I wrote in bird-watching.

01:20.706 --> 01:21.706
Oh, that's clever.

01:21.840 --> 01:23.712
Except for the fact we didn't schedule
any bird-watching.

01:23.713 --> 01:24.313
so?

01:24.414 --> 01:25.935
So what if people want
to do some bird-watch?

01:25.936 --> 01:27.765
Oh, please.
No one will want to go bird-watching.

01:27.766 --> 01:29.150
How do you know?

01:29.150 --> 01:32.172
Who wants to watch birds?
Why on earth would you watch a bird?

01:32.173 --> 01:34.970
Oh you know what should be on here is hay-bale maze.

01:34.971 --> 01:37.151
I can't believe we're actually having a hay-bale maze.

01:37.152 --> 01:40.214
Oh, what is wrong with people? Walking in hay?

01:40.215 --> 01:43.665
Don't they have lives? Don't they
have televisions and elliptical machines?

01:43.666 --> 01:47.655
What kind of weirdo wants to walk around in a maze of hay?

01:47.656 --> 01:49.300
Taylor Doose and no one else.

01:49.301 --> 01:52.500
But don't you vote on these
things in your adorable little meetings?

01:52.501 --> 01:53.365
He hoodwinked us.

01:53.366 --> 01:56.028
yeah. This year he gave
an impassioned speech about

01:56.029 --> 01:58.691
how his childhood dream was
to visit a hay-bale maze.

01:58.692 --> 02:01.450
And and he was clutching hay and crying.

02:01.451 --> 02:03.444
It was very disconcerting but oddly moving.

02:03.445 --> 02:05.645
So we voted yes. It was a pity vote.

02:05.646 --> 02:06.340
And a hoodwinked vote.

02:06.341 --> 02:09.335
And it turns out he wasn't really
crying so much as he was allergic to the hay.

02:09.336 --> 02:10.900
Oh! Whatever.

02:10.901 --> 02:13.123
Michel, people stopped saying
"whatever" like two years ago.

02:13.124 --> 02:15.225
Whatever. I'm outtie 5,000.

03:14.000 --> 03:14.930
Oh! great

03:14.930 --> 03:15.930
What's the matter, babe?

03:15.931 --> 03:17.989
Logan, did you just polish off a carton of milk?

03:17.990 --> 03:21.082
Oh, yeah, I guess I did. Sorry. There's plenty more in there, though.

03:21.083 --> 03:22.091
Well, actually, no.

03:22.092 --> 03:22.910
Really?

03:22.911 --> 03:26.210
Nope. There's no milk in here for my cereal. It's cool.

03:26.211 --> 03:28.600
I'll just skip breakfast and suffer the afternoon mood swings.

03:28.601 --> 03:31.272
I'm sorry I could have sworn
there were like four or five cartons in there.

03:31.273 --> 03:32.812
Each of these milks is here for a reason.

03:32.813 --> 03:35.604
I need the 2% for my cereal, whole milk for my tea,

03:35.605 --> 03:37.903
half-and-half for my coffee,
skim milk for cooking or baking,

03:37.904 --> 03:40.147
plus, I like to keep lactaid on hand for Doyle.

03:40.148 --> 03:42.570
Which I don't need. Because I'm not lactose intolerant.

03:42.571 --> 03:45.700
You're lactose resistant.
You have a bias against lactose. You're sensitive.

03:45.701 --> 03:48.672
I'm not sensitive. I have no problem with lactose.

03:48.673 --> 03:49.990
There's nothing wrong with being sensitive.

03:49.991 --> 03:52.930
Jake Gyllenhaal is sensitive. Orlando Bloom is sensitive.

03:52.931 --> 03:54.931
Me and lactose are cool. We're down.

03:54.932 --> 03:57.925
I tell you what, I'll replenish the
2% and keep my paws off the lactaid.

03:57.926 --> 03:58.933
I don't need the lactaid.

03:58.934 --> 03:59.655
Good morning.

03:59.656 --> 04:00.820
Me and lactose are bros.

04:00.821 --> 04:01.850
Glad to hear it.

04:01.851 --> 04:03.051
I wouldn't throw Jake Gyllenhaal out of bed.

04:03.052 --> 04:03.900
Also good to know.

04:03.901 --> 04:05.133
Good morning, ace. Welcome to the party.

04:05.134 --> 04:06.618
FYI, there's no 2% milk.

04:06.619 --> 04:07.190
Ah oh.

04:07.191 --> 04:09.900
Guilty as charged. Man, you look great.

04:09.901 --> 04:10.960
That is one smart-looking suit.

04:10.961 --> 04:13.670
Well, let's hope that it does most of the talking because

04:13.671 --> 04:16.725
I keep thinking of questions that they might ask me,

04:16.726 --> 04:20.269
and this lovely little thing keeps
happening where my mind goes completely blank.

04:20.271 --> 04:22.243
You know it's like "Rory, what journalists do you admire?

04:22.244 --> 04:24.955
" ah-um "What journalists do I admire?" And nothing.

04:24.956 --> 04:26.500
It's a blank. It's like a snowstorm in here.

04:26.501 --> 04:27.506
It's all white and empty.

04:28.156 --> 04:28.933
You're gonna be great.

04:28.934 --> 04:29.650
Absolutely.

04:29.651 --> 04:32.845
Or you'll choke. What?
It's your first big interview.

04:32.846 --> 04:35.917
You very well may panic.
I'm just saying, don't panic if you panic.

04:35.918 --> 04:37.566
Ah that's so sweet, Paris.

04:37.567 --> 04:38.953
Which paper is it?

04:38.954 --> 04:40.717
The Providence Journal Bulletin.

04:40.718 --> 04:43.069
The pro jo -- no kidding? It's a good paper.

04:43.070 --> 04:44.797
Excellent reputation. Top-notch staff.

04:44.798 --> 04:46.279
Yeah, it could be a really good job.

04:46.280 --> 04:49.292
Oh on the downside, word on the
street is they work their cubs hard.

04:49.293 --> 04:53.377
Long hours, lots of working
lunches. And they do have a comics section.

04:53.378 --> 04:54.566
What's wrong with a comic section?

04:54.567 --> 04:57.562
Let's just say The New York Times
does not have a comic section.

04:57.563 --> 04:59.675
Speaking of the biz,
I should hit the road here.

04:59.676 --> 05:01.526
Where the heck is my attaché case?

05:01.527 --> 05:02.921
You are gonna be great.

05:02.922 --> 05:03.906
Oh, thanks.

05:03.907 --> 05:06.487
I got a credit-card statement
addressed to you, Logan.

05:06.488 --> 05:09.459
Addressed to you here.
No "care of..." just you.

05:09.460 --> 05:11.507
Yeah that stuff used to
go to my dad's business manager.

05:11.508 --> 05:13.215
I had them forward it here.
Hope that's okay.

05:13.216 --> 05:14.976
That's okay. Isn't it okay?

05:14.977 --> 05:17.794
Yes. You're right. Of course it's okay.

05:17.795 --> 05:19.718
Okay, I need to pick out a coat.

05:19.719 --> 05:21.700
A trench coat would be too
"All The President's Men,"

05:21.701 --> 05:23.317
but my blue coat would be
too "His Girl Friday."

05:23.318 --> 05:26.830
I'm just gonna cut to the chase.
Why are you here?

05:26.831 --> 05:29.205
You're not talking
metaphysically, are you?

05:29.206 --> 05:30.247
Seriously, Huntzberger.

05:30.248 --> 05:33.134
You're used to living in
places with doormen and Danish furniture

05:33.135 --> 05:35.575
and refrigerators so fancy,
magnets won't stick to them.

05:35.576 --> 05:38.350
This craphole's smaller than
the walk-in closet in your last pad.

05:38.351 --> 05:39.210
What's the deal?

05:39.211 --> 05:41.835
Well, my last pad was not my pad, technically.

05:41.836 --> 05:43.213
My dad's company was picking up the rent,

05:43.214 --> 05:44.966
and since I'm no longer working with my dad's company,

05:44.967 --> 05:46.076
they weren't so keen on it.

05:46.077 --> 05:46.843
Plus, you're broke.

05:46.844 --> 05:47.585
I'm not broke.

05:47.586 --> 05:49.270
What about this? Is it too "That Girl"?

05:49.271 --> 05:50.520
You can never be too "That Girl."

05:50.521 --> 05:52.813
Man, those corn flakes really did a number on me.

05:52.814 --> 05:54.955
Okay, I better go catch my train. Have a good day.

05:54.956 --> 05:56.640
- Good luck, ace. Knock 'em dead.
- Okay I will.

05:56.641 --> 05:57.750
- Call me after.
- Okay, bye.

05:59.027 --> 06:01.690
Oh, after you're finished with
all your work, it'd be great if you could…

06:01.691 --> 06:02.905
Pick up some 2%. I'm on it.

06:02.906 --> 06:04.266
"Do the dishes," I was going to say.

06:04.267 --> 06:05.559
Oh, okay, sure.

06:05.560 --> 06:06.907
And, Logan, this probably goes without saying,

06:06.908 --> 06:08.572
but no scrubby sponges on the Teflon pans.

06:08.573 --> 06:09.595
Wouldn't dream of it.

06:11.960 --> 06:14.820
Wow. What'd you do,
raid the New Mexico state library?

06:14.821 --> 06:15.905
I know, I know I just couldn't
anticipate what I'd be in the mood for.

06:15.906 --> 06:20.034
Would I feel like reading Melville or Mcinerney?

06:20.035 --> 06:22.098
Or would I be in more of a Native-American,

06:22.099 --> 06:24.790
interconnected short-narratives mood, in which case,

06:24.791 --> 06:26.771
I'd go for the Louise Erdrich and some "love medicine."

06:26.772 --> 06:28.417
Yeah you know what I love about you?

06:28.418 --> 06:30.055
My dazzling wit and generous heart?

06:30.056 --> 06:33.845
The fact that you could be in a
Native-American's interconnective short-narratives mood.

06:33.846 --> 06:35.490
It's fascinating stuff, and you know what's funny?

06:35.491 --> 06:38.224
Growing up in New England,
it's like you're told over and over

06:38.225 --> 06:40.058
that you live in this old place where houses

06:40.059 --> 06:42.760
are 300 years old and there's all this history, right?

06:42.761 --> 06:43.275
Right,

06:43.276 --> 06:46.452
Well, some of these pueblos,
like the Aztec ruins national monument,

06:46.453 --> 06:48.012
or the Casamero Pueblo ruins --

06:48.013 --> 06:51.044
I mean, people were living there in 1100 A.D.

06:51.045 --> 06:52.445
It's like, "suck it, New England."

06:52.446 --> 06:53.296
It's like what?

06:53.297 --> 06:56.032
And actually, one of my swim-team friends lives on

06:56.033 --> 06:58.697
the Jicarilla Apache reservation, which is pretty fabulous.

06:58.698 --> 07:00.118
Fabulous, huh?

07:00.119 --> 07:01.761
"Fabulous" is the new word in school.

07:01.762 --> 07:05.519
I see so New Mexico doesn't
seem so terrible after all, huh?

07:05.520 --> 07:07.940
Yeah, not so terrible.

07:07.941 --> 07:11.600
You know, you look good.
Grown-up. Maybe it's the new glasses.

07:11.601 --> 07:14.263
Thanks. A girl can only be
called Sally Jessy so many times

07:14.264 --> 07:16.147
before she has to rethink the red frames.

07:16.148 --> 07:18.448
Plus, I think these go better with earrings.

07:18.449 --> 07:19.449
With...

07:21.080 --> 07:23.665
Oh, look at that. You got pierced ears.

07:23.666 --> 07:26.768
I basically had to.
Unadorned ears seem like a total waste

07:26.769 --> 07:28.000
when all around where I live,

07:28.001 --> 07:31.563
all this fabulous jewelry making
is going on. Oh, speaking of which...

07:32.564 --> 07:34.120
- What's this?
- Open it.

07:37.221 --> 07:38.794
Oh, wow, a bracelet.

07:38.795 --> 07:42.330
Navaho tradition says that
turquoise is a piece of sky that fell to earth.

07:42.331 --> 07:44.250
And the apache used to put little pieces of it

07:44.251 --> 07:46.290
on their arrows so that they'd aim more true.

07:46.291 --> 07:49.421
Well that is very sweet
of you, April. Thank you very much.

07:49.422 --> 07:52.823
Well? Put it on. Let's see what it looks like.

07:56.670 --> 08:00.020
- Fab-u-lous.
- Yeah, fabulous.

08:00.021 --> 08:01.539
- Totally.
-Yeah.

08:02.540 --> 08:04.403
Is that a rhetorical question?

08:04.404 --> 08:05.103
I beg your pardon?

08:05.104 --> 08:08.886
You said, "who doesn't love
the spring fling festival?" And I'm asking…

08:08.887 --> 08:11.548
Because we just can't
imagine anyone who doesn't love it.

08:11.549 --> 08:12.443
Michel, will you grab their keys?

08:12.444 --> 08:15.500
Mr. And Mrs. Sinclair,
it's so wonderful to have you back. Welcome.

08:15.501 --> 08:18.338
We've been dreaming about
the festival since the middle of January.

08:18.339 --> 08:19.663
Mm-hmm. This winter was a doozy.

08:19.664 --> 08:22.304
I got my tongue stuck to the swing set in our backyard.

08:22.305 --> 08:23.084
Wow. Really?

08:23.085 --> 08:24.858
He did. I had to get my hair dryer and

08:24.859 --> 08:26.514
an extension cord and melt the poor thing free.

08:27.015 --> 08:30.030
Well, it's just pony rides and funnel cakes from now on.

08:30.031 --> 08:32.118
Let me show you all our information.

08:32.119 --> 08:35.097
Oh, just excuse me one second.
Dragonfly inn.

08:35.770 --> 08:37.020
- Hey.
- Hi, how did it go?

08:37.020 --> 08:37.916
It went great!

08:37.917 --> 08:40.317
Wow, that's great. Hold on
a second. I'll be right back.

08:40.318 --> 08:43.008
Michel, will you talk to Rory?
Okay, so here's your map.

08:43.009 --> 08:46.052
- Hello.
- Hey, Michel. How's it going?

08:46.053 --> 08:48.930
Middling to poor. Where are you? I hear noise.

08:48.931 --> 08:51.401
I'm on a train on my way back from Providence.

08:51.402 --> 08:53.021
- Oh.
- What?

08:53.022 --> 08:54.278
I do not care for trains.

08:54.279 --> 08:56.166
Oh, no? I'm sorry.

08:56.167 --> 08:57.120
Trains are dirty.

08:57.121 --> 08:59.703
Well, this train doesn't look very dirty.

08:59.704 --> 09:02.010
You know what I find particularly disgusting?

09:02.011 --> 09:02.926
What?

09:02.927 --> 09:08.110
Train tracks. They remind me
somehow of trails left behind by slugs.

09:08.111 --> 09:10.892
You know there are a lot of slugs in the spring, you know?

09:10.893 --> 09:13.044
Oozing all over the place.

09:13.045 --> 09:17.875
Uh, I think your mother is
done now. It was nice talking to you.

09:17.876 --> 09:20.333
Thank you. Have a good time.
Hey.

09:20.334 --> 09:22.343
So it's spring fling time again, huh?

09:22.344 --> 09:25.320
Oh, yeah, when a young
man's fancy turns to being totally rude.

09:25.321 --> 09:27.990
So tell me about the interview. I want to hear everything.

09:27.991 --> 09:29.213
You walked in the door. What kind of door?

09:29.214 --> 09:30.728
You sat in a chair. What kind of chair? Go.

09:30.729 --> 09:35.177
I met the editor, Kate Hessel, and she invited me in.

09:35.178 --> 09:39.030
I sat down, we started talking,
and we just had so much to talk about.

09:39.031 --> 09:40.975
It was great. It was an amazing interview.

09:40.976 --> 09:42.603
Wow! That's great!

09:42.604 --> 09:46.472
It was we talked about Seymour
Hersh and how he was comparing Iran to Nicaragua

09:46.473 --> 09:48.455
and the contra war and everything,

09:48.456 --> 09:51.548
from Alexander Haig and
Watergate to the Oprah phenomenon.

09:51.549 --> 09:54.980
And the best part was I was just being myself, you know?

09:54.981 --> 09:57.016
I was just talking, and I forgot about impressing her.

09:57.017 --> 09:58.829
But there you were, impressing her.

09:58.830 --> 10:00.940
Yeah and she said she'd call me by tomorrow

10:00.941 --> 10:02.372
to let me know whether or not I got the job.

10:02.373 --> 10:03.597
Wow, tomorrow?

10:03.598 --> 10:05.919
Yes I feel that everything's happening so fast.

10:05.920 --> 10:07.871
I can't believe school's almost over.

10:07.872 --> 10:09.189
I can't believe it's spring already.

10:09.190 --> 10:12.277
Well, it is, believe me.
We are lousy with spring flingers here

10:12.278 --> 10:13.966
How are those spring flingers?

10:13.967 --> 10:16.660
Well you know, as bright-eyed and bushy-tailed as ever.

10:16.661 --> 10:17.713
So you gonna make it this year?

10:17.714 --> 10:19.325
Oh I do want to come, but…

10:19.326 --> 10:21.523
Yay! Did I just "yay" over your "but"?

10:21.524 --> 10:23.695
But I wanted to check with you first because

10:23.696 --> 10:25.555
I want to make sure it's cool if I bring Logan, too.

10:25.556 --> 10:29.259
Oh. Y-yes, of course. Gosh,
I should have thought of that. I'm sorry.

10:29.260 --> 10:30.292
Oh, no, it's cool.

10:30.293 --> 10:32.623
You can give him the grand tour of Stars Hollow,

10:32.624 --> 10:35.240
and I'll show embarrassing
pictures of you picking your nose.

10:35.241 --> 10:36.549
Oh, no. No baby pictures.

10:36.550 --> 10:40.294
Who said they're baby pictures?
So, um, you're bringing a guy home.

10:40.295 --> 10:42.225
It's not like I picked him up at a truck stop.

10:42.226 --> 10:45.440
No, no, I know. You're
bringing a suitor, a gentleman caller,

10:45.441 --> 10:47.375
home to stars hollow. I'm gonna have to get out

10:47.376 --> 10:49.545
my pipe and dust off my
"what are your intentions?" Cue cards.

10:49.546 --> 10:51.965
Next stop, mystic. Mystic, Connecticut.

10:51.966 --> 10:52.744
Listen to you on the train.

10:52.745 --> 10:55.286
I know. I'm in my suit. I'm reading the paper.

10:55.287 --> 10:57.280
Coming back from your job interview.

10:57.281 --> 11:00.865
I know I just went on an
interview for a real job in the real world.

11:00.866 --> 11:02.426
Wow, I am impressed.

11:02.427 --> 11:05.271
- Thanks, mom.
-Seriously. I'm impressed.

11:05.272 --> 11:06.243
I'll see you tomorrow.

11:06.244 --> 11:19.904
Okay, here we are! This is the entryway,

11:19.905 --> 11:23.051
or the foyer, if you're feeling fancy or French.

11:23.052 --> 11:23.715
Wow.

11:23.716 --> 11:25.945
You can just leave that
stuff here. What do you mean "wow"?

11:25.946 --> 11:27.856
When you walk into your parents' foyer,

11:27.857 --> 11:31.129
there is a genuine-article Magritte
right there and a chandelier the size of

11:31.130 --> 11:33.435
a Volkswagen. Now, that is a foyer with a capital "F."

11:33.436 --> 11:36.235
Yeah but this is where Rory
Gilmore grew up -- the Rory Gilmore.

11:36.236 --> 11:38.498
- Hello?
- Are you here?

11:38.499 --> 11:41.555
No, we're really far away screaming really loudly.

11:41.556 --> 11:44.457
Ha ha ha. Hi, hi! Welcome, welcome!

11:44.458 --> 11:45.458
How you doing, Lorelai?

11:45.459 --> 11:49.908
Good, good. Apparently I say
everything twice now. It's charming. Charming.

11:49.909 --> 11:52.491
- Well, these are for you.
-Oh! Wow. Thank you.

11:52.492 --> 11:53.363
Thank you for having me.

11:53.364 --> 11:55.190
They're beautiful. I'll put them in a vase.

11:55.191 --> 11:56.250
They're Cymbidium orchids.

11:56.251 --> 11:58.014
They're native to the foothills of the Himalayas.

11:58.015 --> 12:01.873
Well, that sounds fancy.
And they look fancy, too. Wow.

12:01.874 --> 12:03.177
This is a beautiful house.

12:03.178 --> 12:06.192
Thank you. I never know
what to say when somebody says that.

12:06.193 --> 12:09.024
You don't want to agree, but on the other hand,

12:09.025 --> 12:11.792
it feels weird to disagree
and say, "no, it's a dump," so thank you.

12:11.793 --> 12:13.398
It's charming. Charming.

12:13.399 --> 12:16.177
Hey, mom, we still get
cell reception in here, right?

12:16.178 --> 12:17.878
Yeah, of course, honey. Why? Ooh, the job.

12:17.879 --> 12:20.735
Yeah, she said she'd let me know by today.

12:20.736 --> 12:22.784
Today's not over. Today's just starting.

12:22.785 --> 12:25.303
Oh, honey, I'm sure
she's just busy at work, you know?

12:25.304 --> 12:27.645
Speaking of which, I should get to work

12:27.646 --> 12:30.077
because Michel's mental state is very precarious today.

12:30.078 --> 12:31.239
Yeah, go. We'll be fine.

12:31.240 --> 12:33.808
Okay I circled some stuff
in the paper for you, though.

12:33.809 --> 12:36.165
So you'd have stuff to do.
There's some movies

12:36.166 --> 12:37.991
if you feel like going to the movies.

12:37.992 --> 12:41.604
And um I noticed that the
colonial butter churners are having

12:41.605 --> 12:44.521
an exhibition at the antiquarian
society. That could be kind of funny.

12:44.522 --> 12:46.831
And um then there will be a lot to do tomorrow

12:46.832 --> 12:47.259
with the festival and everything.

12:47.260 --> 12:51.649
There will be games and face-painting and stuff like that...

12:51.650 --> 12:53.445
- Mom.
- What? You've lived here before?

12:53.446 --> 12:55.234
Yeah I think I
remember enough to show Logan around.

12:55.235 --> 12:56.865
This is the town with the Sistine chapel, right?

12:56.866 --> 12:58.385
Oh yeah and don't forget to show him the Pyramids,

12:58.386 --> 13:00.093
Kitty-corner from the Wailing wall.

13:00.994 --> 13:01.590
Thank you.

13:01.591 --> 13:04.184
Thanks. Um so I got you guys set up in Rory's room,

13:04.185 --> 13:06.740
and um just make yourselves at home.

13:06.741 --> 13:08.894
I made up the bed for you and the trundle bed,

13:08.895 --> 13:12.031
so you can do whatever you want. I mean, bed-wise.

13:12.032 --> 13:13.259
Okay great, that's great.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.294
So I'll see you later for dinner.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.315
Unless you want to have
dinner alone, which is total cool.

13:17.316 --> 13:18.183
Don't be ridiculous.

13:18.184 --> 13:19.051
We want to have dinner with you.

13:19.052 --> 13:20.691
Okay, good. Well I have the town meeting,

13:20.692 --> 13:24.051
but I'll be home after.
I will wow you with my takeout-ordering skills.

13:24.052 --> 13:25.037
She really is amazing.

13:25.038 --> 13:26.680
There's talk of a show on the food network.

13:26.681 --> 13:27.242
Sounds great.

13:27.243 --> 13:29.201
And you have some guest towels there.

13:29.202 --> 13:30.782
Oh, I didn't know we had guest towels.

13:30.783 --> 13:33.900
Of course. "Guest towels."
A fancy way of saying "towels that are clean."

13:34.383 --> 13:35.940
All right, I'll see you later. Have fun.

13:35.941 --> 13:38.551
Okay, bye. I'll take that, then.

13:41.215 --> 13:42.052
- Come here.
- What?

13:44.245 --> 13:45.559
Why don't you come over here and find out?

13:45.560 --> 13:49.104
What? Here? Where the Rory Gilmore used to sleep?

13:51.290 --> 13:52.874
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:55.569 --> 13:59.875
And 4 and 5. Keep those
toes pointed. Mary, that means you.

13:59.876 --> 14:05.250
Extend and reach out. Roots push into the soil!

14:06.250 --> 14:11.630
And this right here  this is the very curb
where I fell off my bicycle the second time.

14:11.631 --> 14:12.018
Wait, is that blood?

14:12.019 --> 14:14.722
Yeah you joke,
but it was very traumatic, okay?

14:14.723 --> 14:16.087
I scraped up my whole face.

14:16.088 --> 14:19.478
There was a big old scab on my
nose the first two weeks of fifth grade.

14:19.479 --> 14:20.814
Oh, they called me bozo.

14:20.815 --> 14:23.875
- Bozo.
- And Rudolph and scab nose.
- Oh.

14:24.476 --> 14:27.845
This is the curb where I
fell off my bike the third time.

14:27.846 --> 14:28.851
Oh, poor little scab nose.

14:28.852 --> 14:31.140
Yes. It's also the place where I decided

14:31.141 --> 14:33.149
I would never ride a bicycle again in my entire life,

14:33.150 --> 14:34.720
or at least till the end of elementary school.

14:34.721 --> 14:35.585
There should be a plaque.

14:35.586 --> 14:38.025
There should be. Oh and
this is Miss Patty's dance school.

14:38.026 --> 14:39.427
Any injuries incurred here?

14:39.428 --> 14:40.530
Only psychological ones.

14:40.531 --> 14:44.652
That's cute. Those are some
pretty avant-garde costumes there?

14:44.653 --> 14:47.556
They are. They're bold.
It's for the dance of the daffodils.

14:47.557 --> 14:50.278
There are three acts,
you see. In the first one, the bulbs dance,

14:50.279 --> 14:53.875
then they grow stalks, and
then they bloom into daffodils by the third.

14:53.876 --> 14:55.302
- Oh, that's cute.
- Mm-hmm.

14:55.303 --> 14:57.862
And this hay-bale maze -- this is all Taylor's idea?

14:57.863 --> 14:58.525
Yep.

14:58.526 --> 15:01.443
This is the same Taylor who is
town selectman and owns two businesses.

15:01.444 --> 15:03.369
Yeah, he's basically the Mayor of Stars Hollow

15:03.370 --> 15:05.421
and Don Corleone all wrapped up into one.

15:05.422 --> 15:07.094
- That's fascinating.
- That's fascinating?

15:07.095 --> 15:08.635
I find Stars Hollow fascinating.

15:08.636 --> 15:09.354
You're out of your gourd.

15:09.355 --> 15:10.455
No, I'm very much in my gourd.

15:10.456 --> 15:13.315
It's like colonial Williamsburg
with fewer knickers and Tricorn hats.

15:13.316 --> 15:16.129
And more hay? This is Luke's diner.

15:16.130 --> 15:19.880
Oh. When you were younger,
were you in the dance of the daffodils?

15:19.881 --> 15:21.165
- Maybe.
- You were, weren't you?

15:21.166 --> 15:23.221
Well, therein lies the psychological injury.

15:23.222 --> 15:23.859
What happened?

15:23.860 --> 15:25.574
I didn't bloom. My headpiece malfunctioned.

15:25.575 --> 15:27.176
- Poor little scab nose.
- Yeah.

15:27.177 --> 15:29.456
Wow, the famous Luke's.

15:29.757 --> 15:31.980
- Rory!
- Oh, hey, Zach! You know Logan.

15:31.981 --> 15:33.305
Sure, sure. How's it going, man?

15:33.306 --> 15:34.477
Great I'm having a great time.

15:34.478 --> 15:36.396
Hey, we just saw Kwan and Steve.

15:36.397 --> 15:38.611
Oh, yeah? Wait, Lane was there, too, right?

15:38.612 --> 15:40.213
- Yeah.
- She was there. She looks great.

15:40.214 --> 15:42.500
Yeah and the babies are already growing so big.

15:42.501 --> 15:45.129
I know, huh? Especially
Kwan. Well, at least in the torso.

15:45.130 --> 15:49.000
He's got this superlong torso,
but Steve's growing in the arms and legs department.

15:49.001 --> 15:50.180
I noticed he has long legs.

15:50.181 --> 15:52.758
Dude, Steve's an octopus,
man, but Kwan's got the torso.

15:52.759 --> 15:53.473
When it comes to torso, he's so on it.

15:53.474 --> 15:57.590
Well, I got to get back to work. You guys sit anywhere you like.

15:57.591 --> 15:58.207
Thanks, Zach.

16:00.208 --> 16:00.977
So, is this your table?

16:00.978 --> 16:02.849
Oh, I guess they're all kind of mine.

16:02.850 --> 16:04.281
They're each my own little kitchen table.

16:07.982 --> 16:09.182
- No call?
- No call.

16:09.183 --> 16:12.005
- Don't worry.
- Rory, hey!

16:12.006 --> 16:13.525
- Hey.
- Hey, Logan.

16:13.526 --> 16:14.123
How's it going, man?

16:14.124 --> 16:16.617
Good, good. So what brings
you to this neck of the woods?

16:16.618 --> 16:18.308
Ah the spring fling, and it's my neck --

16:18.309 --> 16:20.585
of the woods, I mean.
I wanted to show Logan around.

16:20.586 --> 16:21.575
Well, it's good to see you.

16:21.576 --> 16:21.813
Yeah you too.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.453
You know April's here for the festival, too.

16:23.454 --> 16:26.220
She's hanging out with her swim
buddies, but I know she'd love to see you.

16:26.221 --> 16:26.750
Oh, great.

16:26.751 --> 16:28.075
You guys know what you
want, do you need a minute?

16:28.076 --> 16:29.365
Do you want to peruse the menu first?

16:29.366 --> 16:30.355
- Sure.
- We'll peruse.

16:30.356 --> 16:30.909
Peruse away.

16:34.655 --> 16:36.040
She'll call you. Now, put it away.

16:36.041 --> 16:38.059
- But...
- Put it away.

16:38.060 --> 16:41.828
Hmm. You know, it's so not a big deal.

16:41.829 --> 16:42.829
What isn't?

16:42.830 --> 16:44.809
Not getting this job.
I mean It's not even my first choice.

16:44.810 --> 16:47.375
What I really want is the Reston fellowship.

16:47.376 --> 16:50.763
And not getting this job is just so not a big deal.

16:50.764 --> 16:51.573
Okay.

16:51.574 --> 16:53.917
Yeah, I mean, and Providence? It's no Manhattan.

16:53.918 --> 16:55.096
That's true, because it's Providence.

16:55.097 --> 16:58.564
- Right.
- What the hell?

16:58.565 --> 16:59.827
Whoa.

17:00.828 --> 17:04.513
Taylor, you cannot...
Taylor, what the hell are you doing?

17:04.515 --> 17:05.953
Now, take it easy, Luke.

17:05.954 --> 17:07.905
I am taking it easy, Taylor.

17:07.906 --> 17:11.103
No, you're not. The veins
in your neck are starting to pop out at me.

17:11.104 --> 17:13.726
Why is there a giant wall
of hay right in front of my diner?!

17:13.727 --> 17:17.255
The entire town voted.
I'm just executing what the town wants

17:17.256 --> 17:19.825
This is not what the town
wants. This is what you want!

17:19.826 --> 17:22.609
-Oh, stars hollow is better than Colonial Williamsburg.
-Mm-hmm.

17:27.175 --> 17:29.240
So they're staying in the trundle bed, huh?

17:29.241 --> 17:30.241
Yep.

17:30.242 --> 17:31.242
So if they're all cozy and trundly,

17:31.243 --> 17:34.147
I guess that means Logan's out of the doghouse, huh?

17:34.148 --> 17:37.128
Out of the doghouse.
Back to roaming the neighborhood.

17:37.329 --> 17:38.927
What is that tone?

17:38.928 --> 17:42.053
Oh, no tone. He's lovely.
I'm glad that they're doing well

17:42.054 --> 17:44.975
and they're back together
and that he stopped gallivanting.

17:45.476 --> 17:46.505
Gallivanting?

17:46.506 --> 17:48.880
You know, gambling in Vegas, jumping off buildings,

17:48.881 --> 17:50.225
whatever it was he was doing.

17:50.226 --> 17:52.215
Of course, I don't love
that he was doing it so recently.

17:52.216 --> 17:54.605
Sounds like Logan's still in somebody's doghouse.

17:54.606 --> 17:56.869
No, no, no. Logan's a lovely young man.

17:56.870 --> 17:57.895
He's nice and polite and funny.
He's got that hair, you know?

17:57.896 --> 18:01.580
The hair that could sell shampoo to a bald man.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.202
Logan is a very charming young man.

18:04.203 --> 18:05.879
- I know that tone.
- What tone?

18:05.880 --> 18:08.555
That. The sound of repressed judgment.

18:08.556 --> 18:09.546
I don't know what you're talking about.

18:09.547 --> 18:13.289
I am talking about last
month at the book-shop bake sale

18:13.290 --> 18:16.185
when Winsen brown came up
and told us that her daughter Maude

18:16.186 --> 18:19.582
was just signed by ford, you
know, as a baby model, and you were like,

18:19.583 --> 18:23.221
"oh, Winsen, that's wonderful. What a great way

18:23.222 --> 18:26.834
for a 9-month-old to see the world.
" That's the exact same tone.

18:26.835 --> 18:28.229
I don't mean to be judgmental.

18:28.230 --> 18:32.442
I know that's why you're talking
like you've had your jaw wired shut.

18:32.443 --> 18:35.486
No, I just... I mean, Rory is an adult now, you know?

18:35.487 --> 18:38.268
She's riding trains and wearing suits.

18:38.269 --> 18:43.332
Made sense for me to have an
opinion when we were talking about Jess or Dean,

18:43.333 --> 18:48.316
but with Logan, I don't know.
It's just really not my place anymore.

18:48.317 --> 18:48.892
I see.

18:48.893 --> 18:51.663
I mean sure, I don't love
that he just did a business deal

18:51.664 --> 18:54.544
behind his father's back and lost millions of dollars.

18:54.545 --> 18:58.595
And I don't love that after that,
he quit his job and moved in with Rory.

18:58.596 --> 19:00.060
These are not things I love.

19:00.061 --> 19:01.061
And I'm not crazy

19:01.062 --> 19:07.950
in the name of getting on his
feet, he's writing in some sort of idea book,

19:07.951 --> 19:09.190
which is, as far as I can tell,

19:09.191 --> 19:10.405
is just a notebook in which he writes ideas.

19:10.406 --> 19:10.887
Wait, what?

19:10.888 --> 19:12.480
Yeah, right. I mean I have a dream journal,

19:12.481 --> 19:14.842
but I don't use it as
evidence of my responsibility.

19:14.843 --> 19:19.275
Look, he's an overcoiffed,
overprivileged young man, but it's not my place.

19:19.276 --> 19:21.345
- To judge.
- Exactly.
- Mm-hmm.

19:21.346 --> 19:23.645
Wait a minute. Where are the booths?

19:23.646 --> 19:25.288
Where are the booths?

19:25.289 --> 19:28.190
I mean, the festival's
tomorrow. All I see is hay.

19:28.191 --> 19:30.315
A ridiculous amount of hay.

19:30.316 --> 19:31.427
Huh!

19:31.428 --> 19:33.710
Wow! It's crowded.

19:33.711 --> 19:34.602
Yeah full house, huh?

19:34.603 --> 19:35.840
- Lorelai!
- Hey.

19:35.841 --> 19:38.000
Hey I'm gonna go find
Jackson. I'll save you a seat.

19:38.001 --> 19:42.136
Okay. April, hi!
How you guys doing?

19:42.137 --> 19:43.137
Oh, I'm fabulous.

19:43.138 --> 19:45.658
Fabulous. So how is New Mexico treating you?

19:45.659 --> 19:47.816
You had any interesting encounters with UFOs lately?

19:47.817 --> 19:49.294
Oh, tons, but you know what they say -

19:49.295 --> 19:51.766
"What happens in Roswell stays in Roswell."

19:51.767 --> 19:52.876
Hmm. Do they say that?

19:52.877 --> 19:54.117
Well, she does.

19:54.118 --> 19:56.772
Wow, someone got their
ears pierced. Glamorous.

19:56.773 --> 19:57.690
Thank you.

19:57.691 --> 19:59.260
Someone's growing up fast, huh?

19:59.261 --> 19:59.696
NO kidding.

19:59.697 --> 20:01.907
I can hear you guys, you know. I'm getting our seat.

20:01.908 --> 20:02.806
Alright I'll be right there.

20:02.807 --> 20:03.807
See you later, Lorelai.

20:03.808 --> 20:07.798
Bye, hon. Oh. So...

20:07.799 --> 20:09.224
So, how's the Inn?

20:09.225 --> 20:11.436
Good. It's, uh, full of spring flingers.

20:11.437 --> 20:12.296
Oh, I bet.

20:12.297 --> 20:13.659
How's the diner?

20:13.660 --> 20:15.780
Uh, same as ever. You know.

20:15.781 --> 20:17.096
Yeah.

20:18.545 --> 20:21.015
If everybody would please take
their seats, I'll call this meeting to order.

20:21.016 --> 20:23.180
Well, I guess we better…

20:23.181 --> 20:23.975
- See you later.
- Okay.

20:26.639 --> 20:29.590
Now, I am aware that a small but vocal minority

20:29.591 --> 20:32.915
of you have expressed concern about the progress

20:32.916 --> 20:34.613
of this year's spring fling festival.

20:34.614 --> 20:35.654
I would like to take this time

20:35.655 --> 20:39.118
to assure you that everything is going as planned.

20:41.615 --> 20:42.488
So, how was it with Luke?

20:42.489 --> 20:45.629
Um... polite, succinct, fine.

20:45.630 --> 20:47.037
- Good.
- Yeah.

20:47.038 --> 20:49.643
…well it is Babette, I assure
you there's nothing to worry about.

20:49.644 --> 20:52.224
But what about our booths?
We don't have our booths!

20:52.225 --> 20:56.093
Everything is under control. Take, for instance,

20:56.094 --> 20:58.552
the hay-bale maze.
It's coming along wonderfully.

20:58.553 --> 21:00.383
It's taking over the whole town.

21:01.340 --> 21:01.832
What do you mean?

21:01.833 --> 21:05.094
There's hay everywhere.
I haven't seen so much hay since...

21:05.095 --> 21:08.426
I have never in my life seen so much hay.

21:08.427 --> 21:11.828
Would everyone please take a handful of chill pills?

21:11.829 --> 21:14.282
Where the hell is my damn lemonade booth?

21:14.283 --> 21:16.972
You don't need to worry about your lemonade booth.

21:16.973 --> 21:18.749
Why not? The festival is tomorrow,

21:18.750 --> 21:20.432
and I have to start squeezing my lemons,

21:20.433 --> 21:22.253
and I don't have my equipment or my booth.

21:22.254 --> 21:23.975
You don't have to worry about that, gypsy,

21:23.976 --> 21:29.280
because you don't need to squeeze
lemons because you don't need lemonade.

21:29.281 --> 21:30.133
Because there isn't going
to be a lemonade booth this year.

21:30.134 --> 21:30.575
What?!

21:30.576 --> 21:35.258
The budget for the lemonade booth
has been reallocated to the hay-bale maze.

21:35.259 --> 21:37.435
What about Morey's salty nuts?!

21:37.436 --> 21:39.819
How's he supposed to have his salty nuts booth

21:39.820 --> 21:41.247
if we don't have a lemonade booth?

21:41.248 --> 21:43.105
If people start eating salty nuts and

21:43.106 --> 21:45.525
they don't have easy access
to lemonade, their mouths will fall off.

21:45.526 --> 21:47.298
Well you don't have to worry about that, Babette,

21:47.299 --> 21:50.585
because there's not going
to be a salty nuts booth because

21:50.586 --> 21:54.975
the budget for the salty nuts booth
has been reallocated to the hay-bale maze.

21:54.976 --> 21:56.115
What?!

21:56.116 --> 21:59.000
He spent the entire
budget on the hay-bale maze.

21:59.001 --> 21:59.852
No

21:59.853 --> 22:03.093
I put the entire budget
into the hay-bale maze.

22:03.094 --> 22:03.700
No!

22:03.701 --> 22:05.148
Taylor, you can't do that.

22:05.149 --> 22:08.314
I have an inn full of guests
who've come here, traveled miles,

22:08.315 --> 22:11.912
withstood winter, who blow-dried
their tongues off their swing sets

22:11.913 --> 22:13.387
so they could get to the spring fling

22:13.388 --> 22:14.198
yes

22:14.199 --> 22:17.080
They expect certain
things, the traditional events --

22:17.081 --> 22:18.871
pie-eating contests, pony rides.

22:18.872 --> 22:21.639
They don't want just a
hay-bale maze and nothing else.

22:21.640 --> 22:25.440
Feast your eyes on this bad boy.

22:26.441 --> 22:26.800
Taylor!

22:27.835 --> 22:31.404
That goes right up to
my diner. It's blocking my entire diner.

22:31.405 --> 22:33.238
I don't get it. Is it a race?

22:33.239 --> 22:38.125
You people clearly don't
understand the long and rich history of mazes.

22:38.126 --> 22:42.422
Ladies and gentlemen of
stars hollow, perhaps this will help.

22:44.423 --> 22:44.800
Oh, my god.

22:44.801 --> 22:46.946
What the hell is that?

22:46.947 --> 22:48.451
I am the Minotaur!

22:49.452 --> 22:50.845
The weird thing is he's been in that

22:50.846 --> 22:52.962
head under that velvet cloth this whole time.

22:52.963 --> 22:56.055
Although the word "labyrinth"
is used interchangeably with "maze,"

22:56.056 --> 22:59.990
maze scholars insist upon a distinction.

22:59.991 --> 23:02.160
Hey, Kirk! What's with the cow's head?

23:03.161 --> 23:04.510
Where are you people going?

23:04.511 --> 23:09.116
A labyrinth is a universal maze,
a maze without branches, without choices...

23:10.432 --> 23:11.083
You ready?

23:11.084 --> 23:14.630
This is important. The Minotaur is speaking.

23:14.631 --> 23:17.062
...Blind alleys down which to proceed.

23:17.063 --> 23:20.366
Now, the first maze in recorded history...

23:23.367 --> 23:25.590
People are gonna miss
your salty nuts, baby. They are.

23:34.870 --> 23:37.344
- Insane.
- Insane.
- Insane

23:44.420 --> 23:45.223
Hi, I'm home!

23:45.224 --> 23:46.363
We're in here!

23:46.364 --> 23:48.762
We got a new Thai menu
that looks kind of promising.

23:48.763 --> 23:53.539
I don't know where
Jessington way is, though… or never mind.

23:53.540 --> 23:55.495
I am -- I am shocked.

23:55.496 --> 23:58.227
I-I'm shocked to
find there's cooking going on in here.

23:58.228 --> 23:59.400
It is shocking, isn't it?

23:59.401 --> 24:00.473
We're making paella.

24:00.474 --> 24:02.953
Paella? Who can even spell paella,

24:02.954 --> 24:04.460
let alone make it? That smells good.

24:04.461 --> 24:06.250
Can I get you wine? We have red and white.

24:06.251 --> 24:07.483
Yeah and in paella, there's chicken,

24:07.484 --> 24:09.030
sausage, and shrimp. So anything goes.

24:09.031 --> 24:09.763
Uh, red, please.

24:09.764 --> 24:10.807
How was the town meeting?

24:10.808 --> 24:11.929
Oh yeah, how was Taylor?

24:11.930 --> 24:13.126
Logan's fascinated with Taylor.

24:13.127 --> 24:13.950
He's fascinating.

24:13.951 --> 24:17.765
He's insane. He is ripping
out the gazebo with a crane.

24:17.766 --> 24:18.597
What? What do you mean?

24:18.598 --> 24:21.450
He's ripping out the gazebo with a crane.

24:21.451 --> 24:24.348
He thinks that it defeats the purpose of the maze

24:24.349 --> 24:26.440
if we can still see a town landmark.

24:26.441 --> 24:28.693
Wait. I cannot believe that he is doing that.

24:28.694 --> 24:31.333
That gazebo has been there
since Paul Revere was a baby boy.

24:31.334 --> 24:33.340
I know. So what can I do? How can I help?

24:33.341 --> 24:34.353
You can chop peppers.

24:34.354 --> 24:36.855
Peppers. Those are the -- oh, right.

24:36.856 --> 24:38.795
Hey, how do you know how to make paella?

24:38.796 --> 24:42.039
Well, when I was a junior at Exeter or -- no, sorry,

24:42.040 --> 24:44.159
Andover -- I did a semester abroad in Spain.

24:44.160 --> 24:45.375
Spain -- wow.

24:45.376 --> 24:51.678
Oh! I think that's me.
Hello?…

24:51.679 --> 24:56.242
Um so, I heard you had
a really tough business deal.

24:56.243 --> 24:57.559
I'm sorry about that.

24:57.560 --> 25:00.218
Oh, yeah, that's the way it
goes. You know these things happen.

25:00.219 --> 25:02.328
A business is like an
ocean. You just got to surf it.

25:02.329 --> 25:07.385
Right. Um, but Rory said
you're working on some new ideas.

25:07.386 --> 25:08.026
How's that going?

25:08.027 --> 25:10.405
Great. Really great. It's an exciting time.

25:10.406 --> 25:12.067
This is the real dot-com renaissance.

25:12.068 --> 25:14.326
Everything's changing
from the way media is sourced to

25:14.327 --> 25:15.650
the way we buy things to what we buy.

25:15.651 --> 25:18.334
All the restrictions of the brick-and-mortar

25:18.335 --> 25:19.436
retail mall are gonna be a thing of the past.

25:19.437 --> 25:20.220
Hmm.

25:20.221 --> 25:22.885
Oh, yeah, it's way
beyond Amazon and eBay now.

25:22.886 --> 25:25.386
It's kind of like what's
going on with these simulation games,

25:25.387 --> 25:27.978
like "Second Life" or "World of Warcraft."

25:27.979 --> 25:30.388
Actual currency is
being exchanged for virtual goods.

25:30.389 --> 25:31.061
Oh, yeah?

25:31.062 --> 25:32.784
I mean theoretically, I could make a fortune

25:32.785 --> 25:35.790
selling virtual Lightsabers
or something on "Everquest 2"

25:35.791 --> 25:40.490
Whatever happened to selling
encyclopedias? Not virtual enough, I guess.

25:40.491 --> 25:42.766
Ideas are really my commodity.

25:42.767 --> 25:45.210
With the experience I have
and the contacts I've gained,

25:45.211 --> 25:46.155
I really feel with the right idea,

25:46.156 --> 25:47.425
boom, I could be right back on top.

25:47.426 --> 25:48.266
Hmm.

25:48.267 --> 25:51.160
Oh, my god. I got it! I got the job!

25:51.161 --> 25:53.400
- Oh, my god, honey!
- I can't believe it!

25:53.401 --> 25:54.220
I can.

25:54.221 --> 25:55.365
I knew you were gonna get it.

25:56.260 --> 25:57.414
It's a real writing job!

25:57.415 --> 25:58.679
A real writing job!

25:58.680 --> 26:01.216
I mean I'd have a salary
and a desk and maybe even an office.

26:01.217 --> 26:02.705
Well, not an office, but she did say something

26:02.706 --> 26:05.186
about a desk and a salary and a 401k,

26:05.187 --> 26:07.115
and I have to tell her
yes or no by Monday. Oh my God.

26:07.116 --> 26:08.264
Oh, I'm so proud of you, Ace.

26:08.265 --> 26:09.265
Oh, honey!

26:09.266 --> 26:11.051
Someone actually wants to pay me to write

26:11.052 --> 26:12.869
We need to celebrate.

26:12.870 --> 26:15.876
- Absolutely.
- All right, to you.

26:16.977 --> 26:18.571
- Cheers.
- You know what this calls for.

26:18.572 --> 26:21.851
-  What?
- Paella.
- Yes.

26:25.000 --> 26:25.923
It's a good job.

26:25.924 --> 26:26.924
- It is.
- Absolutely.

26:26.925 --> 26:27.865
It's a really good job.

26:27.866 --> 26:30.568
I can't really imagine
living in Providence, Road island.

26:30.569 --> 26:32.164
I mean I don't think there's a lot going on there.

26:32.165 --> 26:34.350
Well, there's Brown.
It's a pretty cool college town.

26:34.351 --> 26:36.249
Yeah which would be great if I hadn't just spent

26:36.250 --> 26:38.518
the last four years
in college at a college town.

26:38.519 --> 26:42.249
It is a great paper, though.
I guess that's the part to focus on.

26:42.250 --> 26:43.155
It's an excellent paper.

26:43.156 --> 26:44.902
But it's kind of small.

26:44.903 --> 26:46.884
Well you could be the big fish in the small pond.

26:46.885 --> 26:49.096
Yeah which means I would
actually get to write some articles,

26:49.097 --> 26:50.999
which would be great. But I don't know.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.822
Is it better to be a small fish in a pond where

26:53.823 --> 26:56.344
I'm gonna learn more and
have career-advancement opportunities?

26:56.345 --> 26:58.045
You don't have to decide until Monday,

26:58.046 --> 26:59.519
and between now and
then, you can eat a lot of pie.

26:59.520 --> 27:01.998
Yes, if we ever make it to Weston's.

27:01.999 --> 27:02.608
Seriously.

27:02.609 --> 27:03.709
Yeah, where is this Weston's of yours?

27:03.710 --> 27:05.050
Normally, it's not far away,

27:05.051 --> 27:06.867
but all this hay's
blocking all the parking spots.

27:06.868 --> 27:07.696
It's too much hay.

27:07.697 --> 27:10.117
Yeah well, we're burning off a lot of calories,

27:10.118 --> 27:11.697
so thank goodness you ordered an extra pie.

27:11.698 --> 27:12.845
Two extra pies, actually.

27:12.846 --> 27:13.340
Nice!

27:14.274 --> 27:16.977
To be quite honest,
this is one of the best jobs

27:16.978 --> 27:17.783
I could imagine getting.

27:19.120 --> 27:20.092
That's really great.

27:20.093 --> 27:22.432
I know, but it's just one of, you know?

27:22.433 --> 27:27.229
It's not the best.
It's just... I don't know. I mean,

27:27.230 --> 27:30.820
if I take this job,
I'm giving up the chance at the Reston fellowship.

27:30.821 --> 27:31.821
Which you really, really want.

27:31.822 --> 27:33.849
I'd be giving up The New York Times, you know?

27:33.850 --> 27:38.615
But then, is it idiotic
to give up a great job for this chance

27:38.616 --> 27:40.230
at another job? Not even a job.

27:40.231 --> 27:42.546
The fellowship's only
a six-week paid internship.

27:42.547 --> 27:43.957
Yeah but if the fellowship is your dream,

27:43.958 --> 27:46.622
I don't know I guess
people should go for their dreams.

27:46.623 --> 27:48.711
Yes, honey, I want all your dreams to come true.

27:48.712 --> 27:51.042
You got to go for it sometimes. Screw the 401k.

27:51.043 --> 27:54.045
Oh, well, not everyone
can live in that dream world.

27:54.046 --> 27:55.845
It's not in a dream world, necessarily.

27:55.846 --> 27:57.898
Yes, it is, if you're
talking about following your whims

27:57.899 --> 27:59.743
and neglecting financial security.

27:59.744 --> 28:01.719
I'm not saying to neglect financial security.

28:01.720 --> 28:02.285
Okay.

28:02.286 --> 28:03.600
Not at all. When you're 22,

28:03.601 --> 28:05.724
I don't think a 401k
needs to be your top priority.

28:05.725 --> 28:06.583
That's all I'm saying.

28:06.584 --> 28:10.550
Right, well, all I'm saying is food costs money

28:10.551 --> 28:13.584
and rent costs money
and a salary gives you money,

28:13.585 --> 28:14.753
so that can be a good thing.

28:14.754 --> 28:17.574
I agree. I'm aware of the reality of money.

28:17.575 --> 28:18.046
Okay

28:18.047 --> 28:20.269
All right you guys figure out my future.

28:20.270 --> 28:21.407
I'm gonna go pick up these pies.

28:21.408 --> 28:22.522
Okay.

28:22.523 --> 28:24.731
I just got my first credit-card statement.

28:24.732 --> 28:26.340
I'm very much aware of the reality of money.

28:26.341 --> 28:28.888
You just got your first credit-card statement?

28:30.356 --> 28:32.384
Earning money is great. It's just not everything.

28:32.385 --> 28:33.465
No, I agree.

28:33.466 --> 28:36.809
And I think in this particular
situation, Rory should take the gamble.

28:36.810 --> 28:40.131
The gamble? Rory's not a gambler, you know?

28:40.132 --> 28:42.711
She's a thoughtful, deliberate decision maker.

28:42.712 --> 28:43.518
I know that.

28:43.519 --> 28:45.789
You're a gambler, but that's not her.

28:45.790 --> 28:50.050
Okay, cherry pie, banana-cream
pie, and strawberry-rhubarb pie.

28:50.051 --> 28:50.683
Great!

28:50.684 --> 28:53.432
I just figured, if we're gonna
do pie, we might as well do pie

28:53.433 --> 28:55.023
- Let's do pie.
- Let's do pie.

28:59.230 --> 29:00.298
What you doing awake, Ace?

29:00.299 --> 29:01.002
Oh, I'm sorry.

29:01.003 --> 29:05.337
Oh, a pro/con list.
Classic Rory Gilmore pro/con list.

29:05.338 --> 29:06.209
There's so many factors!

29:06.210 --> 29:06.918
Yeah.

29:06.919 --> 29:10.041
What about all the other
newspapers that have my résumé, you know?

29:10.042 --> 29:12.712
Taking this job means
rejecting all those other possibilities.

29:12.713 --> 29:14.045
I should factor that in.

29:14.046 --> 29:14.625
Yeah.

29:14.626 --> 29:17.962
Or what about the very real
possibility that print journalism is a dying animal?

29:17.963 --> 29:21.007
I should factor that in
as a pro, because newspaper jobs

29:21.008 --> 29:23.543
might become increasingly
rare, and I should snap up what I can get,

29:23.544 --> 29:24.840
but also as a con,

29:24.841 --> 29:25.580
because I should be careful about getting too

29:25.581 --> 29:28.402
entrenched in what could
become an anachronistic medium

29:28.403 --> 29:32.492
Mm-hmm. "Pro -- air quality in Providence as compared

29:32.493 --> 29:36.441
to air quality in Manhattan.
Con -- Chinese-food quality in Providence

29:36.494 --> 29:38.328
as compared to Chinese-food quality in Manhattan."

29:38.329 --> 29:39.465
You need to go to sleep.

29:39.466 --> 29:41.700
Oh, no, but these are pivotal hours.

29:41.701 --> 29:43.580
I mean these are the hours
when I'm gonna make my decision.

29:43.581 --> 29:46.097
You need sleep, haven't you ever
heard of the expression "sleep on it"?

29:46.098 --> 29:46.517
But…

29:46.518 --> 29:48.468
We can do a pro/con list
about you doing a pro/con list,

29:48.469 --> 29:49.649
but I say we do it in the morning.

29:49.650 --> 29:51.039
I guess I am kind of tired.

29:51.040 --> 29:51.847
I bet.

29:56.990 --> 29:57.694
What are you doing there, babe?

29:57.695 --> 30:01.299
Just trying to get my pants on and get some water.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.039
Oh, yeah? Some water? With your pants?

30:02.040 --> 30:06.530
Yeah, I don't want to go out there without pants.

30:06.531 --> 30:08.830
You need to put a shirt on to get water?

30:08.831 --> 30:10.245
Yeah what if your mom's out there?

30:10.246 --> 30:12.212
I don't want her thinking
I'm David Hasselhoff or something.

30:12.213 --> 30:13.413
She's not gonna think you're David Hasselhoff.

30:13.414 --> 30:21.011
Socks? Logan, she's not
gonna think anything weird. I promise.

30:21.012 --> 30:24.365
Socks without shoes looks ridiculous.

30:24.366 --> 30:25.448
I'll be right back, sweetie.

30:25.449 --> 30:27.214
All right, good night, David Hasselhoff.

30:38.800 --> 30:42.305
- Oh.
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

30:42.306 --> 30:43.745
I'm sorry. I didn't wake you, did I?

30:43.746 --> 30:46.295
No, I was... craving some pie,

30:46.296 --> 30:48.600
but you know what? I'm not -- I'm not hungry.

30:48.601 --> 30:49.677
I just needed some water.

30:53.380 --> 30:54.916
- Lorelai?
- Yeah?

30:54.917 --> 30:57.427
I want you to know I'm not a gambler.

30:59.000 --> 30:59.300
Okay

30:59.301 --> 31:02.548
Look, I know that Rory tells you stuff,

31:02.549 --> 31:03.916
and you know all these things about me,

31:03.917 --> 31:06.091
like I know you know
I went to Vegas and all that,

31:06.092 --> 31:07.859
and I just I want you
to know that's not who I am.

31:07.860 --> 31:09.931
I don't want you to be worried.

31:11.790 --> 31:15.898
Well... I am worried.
I'm a mom. That's what we do.

31:15.899 --> 31:18.086
Okay well, what exactly are you worried about?

31:19.485 --> 31:23.065
Okay. I'm worried that
you're not worried enough.

31:23.066 --> 31:24.377
You take things lightly.

31:24.378 --> 31:26.373
This whole "you got to surf the waves" attitude.

31:26.374 --> 31:30.971
"Cowabunga, dude." I mean,
you just lost millions of dollars.

31:30.972 --> 31:32.901
I know. I know I did, believe me.

31:32.902 --> 31:35.271
And I don't feel "Cowabunga, dude" inside.

31:35.272 --> 31:37.598
Believe me, I know I made a big mistake.

31:38.250 --> 31:39.029
You do?

31:39.030 --> 31:42.109
Yeah. But I don't want
to act like that in front of you.

31:42.110 --> 31:45.293
I mean, for one thing,
the whole self-flagellation thing

31:45.294 --> 31:46.540
-- it's kind of embarrassing,

31:46.541 --> 31:48.311
and I just I want you to think well of me.

31:49.816 --> 31:52.760
All right, well... it's good for me to know.

31:52.761 --> 31:55.424
It's good for me to know
that you know you made a mistake.

31:56.520 --> 32:00.087
I made a mistake.
I messed up. I really messed up.

32:00.088 --> 32:04.547
Okay. I think 401k's are important.

32:04.548 --> 32:07.452
I think responsibility and paying your bills

32:07.453 --> 32:09.434
and dealing with reality is important.

32:09.435 --> 32:11.910
Ah well, I'm beginning to learn about reality.

32:11.911 --> 32:13.115
I grew up with a lot of privilege.

32:13.116 --> 32:15.412
Right you had that whole
silver-spoon-in-the-mouth thing,

32:15.413 --> 32:16.825
and that's not how I raised Rory.

32:16.826 --> 32:17.400
I know that.

32:17.401 --> 32:18.988
This was not a silver-spoon household.

32:18.989 --> 32:20.653
This was Spork city all the way.

32:20.654 --> 32:22.670
I get that, and I respect that because

32:22.671 --> 32:26.136
I just spat out a whole place
setting of sterling silver royal Danish.

32:26.137 --> 32:27.466
I left my dad's company,

32:27.467 --> 32:29.904
I left that world because I have my own values.

32:29.905 --> 32:31.232
I understand that.

32:31.233 --> 32:33.254
I thought you would
because that's what you did.

32:33.255 --> 32:35.850
You left the world
of privilege to do things your way.

32:37.140 --> 32:38.985
I guess I never thought of it that way.

32:38.986 --> 32:40.320
And you did it when you were younger and

32:40.321 --> 32:42.530
had a baby to take
care of. It was really impressive.

32:42.531 --> 32:44.480
I don't need you to be impressed by me.

32:44.481 --> 32:46.177
I just need you to know it wasn't easy.

32:46.178 --> 32:46.968
I know that.

32:46.969 --> 32:49.217
I didn't get anything like "boom," you know?

32:49.218 --> 32:50.744
I worked hard for everything I got.

32:50.745 --> 32:55.260
I want to work. I'm ready
to work. And I want to work hard.

32:58.165 --> 33:00.215
- All right, then.
-All right, then.

33:08.216 --> 33:11.475
Since we're up, do you
think we should have some pie?

33:11.476 --> 33:13.676
- Yeah.
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:13.677 --> 33:15.375
You think we should have
some vanilla ice cream on it?

33:15.376 --> 33:17.535
That's my favorite. I love vanilla ice cream.

33:36.700 --> 33:37.770
Are there any people chasing you?

33:37.771 --> 33:40.043
No, it's just a maze -- a maze made out of hay.

33:40.444 --> 33:43.205
And there's no people jumping
out at you with, like, squirt guns?

33:43.206 --> 33:45.962
I don't think so sweetie it's just
a maze, but it's made out of hay!

33:45.963 --> 33:48.477
So, wait a minute.
There's no lights or fireworks?

33:48.478 --> 33:51.807
It's really just a maze
made out of hay? What a drag.

33:51.808 --> 33:53.465
You're preaching to the choir

33:53.466 --> 33:55.925
Well, I can't believe
we're finally here at the maze.

33:55.926 --> 33:57.820
It's all I've dreamed since I could dream.

33:57.821 --> 34:00.454
Oh man there is just
something about being in a maze of hay.

34:00.455 --> 34:01.553
Totally.

34:01.554 --> 34:04.265
Oh man, am I glad I got
out of that waterslide park

34:04.266 --> 34:05.992
so I could come to the hay-bale maze!

34:05.993 --> 34:06.962
Take it down, Olivier.

34:06.963 --> 34:08.083
Not buying the waterslide thing?

34:08.083 --> 34:10.195
Well, just keep it real. Well,

34:10.196 --> 34:13.020
the hay-bale maze is gonna
be really fun, and then afterwards,

34:13.021 --> 34:15.482
Sookie has prepared hot dogs and funnel cakes

34:15.483 --> 34:17.132
and salty nuts -- all the festival classics.

34:17.134 --> 34:18.760
You like hay-bale mazes?

34:18.761 --> 34:20.150
Oh, yeah, I'm crazy about them.

34:20.150 --> 34:22.237
- That's cool.
- Co o on, let's go!

34:24.520 --> 34:25.706
- Hey, thanks.
- No problem.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.725
Wow, look at that. You think maybe Taylor was right?

34:29.726 --> 34:30.489
Bite your tongue.

34:30.491 --> 34:31.478
That man is a genius.

34:31.480 --> 34:33.284
- Whoa!
- Hi, guys.

34:33.286 --> 34:35.884
That was, "whoa!" Right, babe?

34:35.885 --> 34:37.266
- Whoa.
- Oh, you okay?

34:37.266 --> 34:39.768
The maze. Just high on the maze.

34:39.770 --> 34:43.417
Let's go, people. Keep
it moving. Damn allergies.

34:46.408 --> 34:51.565
All right, next 10 can go.
Uh, no gum, no matches, no pushing, no shoving.

34:52.467 --> 34:53.764
No running in the maze!

34:53.766 --> 34:56.748
Oh, and if you get lost
in the maze, don't panic,

34:56.750 --> 34:59.195
just stand still, wave your hands,

34:59.196 --> 35:01.314
and the, uh, maze guard will find you.

35:01.315 --> 35:02.755
Oh I'm gonna say hi to Sookie and Jackson.

35:02.756 --> 35:06.052
I'll be right back. Hey, kids.

35:06.053 --> 35:08.010
Hi, you guys. Did the kids like the maze?

35:08.011 --> 35:09.194
The kids loved the maze

35:09.195 --> 35:10.200
We loved the maze.

35:10.201 --> 35:12.785
- Really?
- Yeah, it's really fun.

35:12.786 --> 35:14.930
But it has no fireworks, no lights,

35:14.931 --> 35:16.575
no guys with squirt guns. Why is it so fun?

35:16.576 --> 35:17.597
It's just cool!

35:19.450 --> 35:21.118
You know when you were
making that pro/con list the last night?

35:21.119 --> 35:21.815
Yeah?

35:21.816 --> 35:24.152
I kind of noticed there
was something on there about me.

35:24.153 --> 35:27.130
Oh. Yeah. I didn't know where to put you.

35:27.131 --> 35:28.952
Yeah, I was that, I saw you wrote "Logan,"

35:28.953 --> 35:30.331
and then there were like three question marks.

35:30.332 --> 35:32.622
Well, there were just so many factors.

35:32.623 --> 35:34.798
And I wasn't sure to
what extent I should factor you in.

35:34.799 --> 35:37.611
Well, I want you to know
I don't want you to factor me in.

35:42.870 --> 35:47.330
No. I mean... I'm not sure
exactly what I'm gonna be doing next,

34:45.331 --> 35:49.701
and I know I want to start putting my ideas out,

35:49.702 --> 35:50.900
and I know I want to start working,

35:50.901 --> 35:52.336
but I think you should do what you want to do,

35:52.337 --> 35:55.627
and then -- and then maybe I'll factor you in.

35:56.760 --> 35:58.565
Oh. You want to factor me in.

35:58.566 --> 36:01.090
Yeah. I'd like that. If you're in providence,

36:01.091 --> 36:01.995
maybe I'll come live in providence.

36:03.386 --> 36:04.036
That would be great.

36:06.260 --> 36:08.349
But just, in general,
I'd like to factor you in, too.

36:08.350 --> 36:11.185
Okay. But for this one, you make your decision

36:11.186 --> 36:13.698
based on what you want
for you. You do what you want.

36:15.660 --> 36:20.593
Okay. You know what I really want?

36:20.594 --> 36:21.175
What's that?

36:21.176 --> 36:28.031
I want to go for the fellowship.
I'm gonna say no to the pro jo.

36:29.240 --> 36:29.708
Okay.

36:31.250 --> 36:32.922
Yeah, I'm gonna go for it. Okay.

36:32.923 --> 36:38.485
Okay, next group! No gum,
no matches, no pushing, no shoving.

36:38.486 --> 36:42.805
If you get lost in the maze,
wave to the man on stilts. You're good to go.

36:42.806 --> 36:43.940
Mom, you want to come with us?

36:43.941 --> 36:45.185
Uh, no, go ahead.

37:06.300 --> 37:07.140
You got the tuna there?

37:07.141 --> 37:09.538
Tuna on rye, tuna on wheat,
mayo, no mayo respectively.

37:09.539 --> 37:14.976
Yeah. No. No, delivery
time hasn't changed. Yeah. No, no, no,

37:14.977 --> 37:17.069
the maze hasn't changed anything. Okay, all right.

37:17.070 --> 37:18.951
Uh, French dip, ham and Swiss,

37:18.952 --> 37:22.445
fries, fries, onion rings,
roast beef, BLT, BLT no "B,".

37:22.446 --> 37:28.953
BLT no "T," turkey on rye,
burger. Yep. No. No problem

37:28.954 --> 37:30.222
- Okay.
- "Okay" what?

37:30.223 --> 37:31.550
Okay I've got something to tell you.

37:31.551 --> 37:32.667
I don't have time for dramatic pauses Zach.

37:32.668 --> 37:34.922
I've mastered the maze. I have. At first,

37:34.923 --> 37:36.667
I thought I had to go
around the maze to make the deliveries,

37:36.668 --> 37:38.580
but, dude, it's easier to go through the maze.

37:38.581 --> 37:38.911
Great, Zach

37:38.912 --> 37:41.528
I know. At first, I wrote
it down, you know the path,

37:41.529 --> 37:44.276
but I don't need it
because it's all up here, or in here.

37:44.277 --> 37:46.720
Check it out, eyes closed -- it goes left,

37:46.721 --> 37:51.600
right, right, left, left,
left, right. Wait. Left, left, right…

37:51.601 --> 37:52.855
Don't give it away.

37:52.856 --> 37:55.090
I am dying to go through
the maze. I bet it's fabulous.

37:55.091 --> 37:56.902
- It so is.
- Go.
- Go?

37:56.903 --> 37:57.770
GO through the maze.

37:57.771 --> 37:59.230
Don't you need help here?

37:59.231 --> 37:59.795
Bye, dad..

37:59.796 --> 38:00.622
Have a fabulous time.

38:00.623 --> 38:02.091
I got a patty-melt burger well-done,

38:02.092 --> 38:04.795
Pastrami on rye, chili dog,
and three orders of fries.

38:04.796 --> 38:07.265
I'm good to go, man. You know what I'm gonna do?

38:07.266 --> 38:08.157
I can't begin to imagine.

38:08.158 --> 38:09.695
I'm gonna go through the maze at night,

38:09.696 --> 38:12.400
all alone, me, a
blindfold. You know how I can do it?

38:12.401 --> 38:13.115
How's that?

38:13.116 --> 38:13.788
I can smell the hay.

38:13.789 --> 38:14.712
We can all smell the hay.

38:14.713 --> 38:16.669
No, dude. I can smell the hay.

39:00.655 --> 39:01.350
Oh, god! Hey.

39:01.351 --> 39:03.450
- Hey.
- "Hey." Hay.

39:03.451 --> 39:04.930
Oh, you got snacks

39:04.931 --> 39:06.429
Yeah, well, Zach forgot these.

39:06.430 --> 39:09.205
The hay's kind of gone to his head.
Anyway he gave me these directions here.

39:09.206 --> 39:10.864
So I just go right, left…what?

39:11.700 --> 39:12.115
What is that?

39:12.116 --> 39:13.668
Oh! April gave it to me.

39:13.669 --> 39:15.087
You have a bracelet on your wrist.

39:15.088 --> 39:17.986
She's into jewelry.
It's just a phase. What could I do?

39:17.987 --> 39:19.179
Uh, wow!

39:19.180 --> 39:21.397
It's just one of these crazy phases.

39:21.398 --> 39:23.440
I was just getting
used to the fact I had a daughter.

39:23.441 --> 39:24.738
Now all of a sudden, I have a teenager.

39:24.739 --> 39:26.346
It's wild. Time just goes by.

39:26.347 --> 39:27.676
- Luke.
- Yeah.

39:29.005 --> 39:30.408
I'm sorry.

39:33.200 --> 39:34.850
Yeah, I'm, uh -- I'm sorry, too.

39:34.851 --> 39:35.851
No, no, let me go first.

39:35.852 --> 39:36.654
Okay.

39:37.810 --> 39:43.083
I messed up. That night
I went to Christopher -- I'm sorry

39:45.324 --> 39:46.049
Yeah.

39:46.050 --> 39:48.489
I mean I never admitted it to
you that it was wrong what I did,

39:48.490 --> 39:49.790
and it was, and I'm really sorry.

39:51.830 --> 39:52.653
Okay. Thanks.

39:54.989 --> 39:56.199
I don't know why I didn't say this before.

39:57.110 --> 40:03.443
Ah. You know... I'm sorry,
too, 'cause... I don't know,

40:03.444 --> 40:09.695
it's just... now that
I've had April, it's... I've learned a lot,

40:09.696 --> 40:12.770
and I was crazy to
think that I had to fix everything

40:12.771 --> 40:15.237
in my relationship with
April before I could really be with you.

40:15.238 --> 40:17.310
And that's just not how you fix things.

40:17.311 --> 40:21.166
I mean things just don't
stand still. They're always changing.

40:21.167 --> 40:21.818
Yeah.

40:21.819 --> 40:24.866
I guess I was compartmentalizing?

40:24.867 --> 40:25.965
If that's what you call it.

40:25.966 --> 40:28.002
I mean I should
have opened my compartments.

40:28.003 --> 40:29.350
I should have gotten your help.

40:30.660 --> 40:31.626
I wanted to help.

40:31.627 --> 40:35.036
I know. And I'm sorry.
And I'm sorry, also,

40:35.037 --> 40:38.230
because I think I used April
to pushed you away.

40:38.695 --> 40:39.542
You did, huh?

40:39.543 --> 40:43.871
Yeah, I think so. I was
afraid, and... I'm so sorry.

40:46.285 --> 40:47.118
It's really okay.

40:49.260 --> 40:51.320
- I'm glad.
- Me too.

40:54.241 --> 40:56.047
Well, I got some fries that are getting cold.

40:56.048 --> 40:57.778
Oh, yeah, well, I got to find my way out of here.

40:57.779 --> 41:01.686
By the way, you're really close.
Just go left, two rights, and you're out.

41:01.687 --> 41:03.075
Thanks.
