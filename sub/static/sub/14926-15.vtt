WEBVTT

00:10.010 --> 00:13.147
MY CHICKEN'S GROSS.

00:13.181 --> 00:14.482
IT'S NOT CHICKEN.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.716
I THINK IT'S HALIBUT.

00:15.749 --> 00:16.817
NO, IT'S NOT HALIBUT.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.219
IT'S GOT A WING.

00:18.252 --> 00:19.287
NOT ON MINE.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.422
YOU'RE ALL WRONG.
IT'S SQUAB.

00:21.455 --> 00:22.756
WHAT'S SQUAB?

00:22.790 --> 00:23.724
IT'S LIKE GAME HEN.

00:23.757 --> 00:26.694
OH, DON'T GO BROADCASTING
YOUR LACK OF CLASS.

00:26.727 --> 00:28.062
IT'S PIGEON.

00:28.096 --> 00:28.796
OH, I'M DONE.

00:28.829 --> 00:31.565
WHAT, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA EAT THAT?

00:32.866 --> 00:33.901
ALL RIGHT,
I'M GONNA GO SEE

00:33.934 --> 00:35.636
IF THERE ARE
ANY MORE OF THOSE
HORS D'OEUVRES LEFT.

00:35.669 --> 00:37.171
YOU CAN'T SCREW UP
PIG-IN-A-BLANKET.

00:37.205 --> 00:41.109
YOU KNOW, I'LL GET SOME
FOR THE WHOLE TABLE.

00:41.842 --> 00:43.544
NICE CEREMONY,
THOUGH, HUH?

00:43.577 --> 00:44.378
YEAH, YOU KNOW,

00:44.412 --> 00:46.480
I REALLY LIKED THAT
15-MINUTE METAPHOR

00:46.514 --> 00:48.349
ABOUT HOW THE RING
IS LIKE A CIRCLE.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.184
YEAH,
THAT WAS VERY DEEP.

00:50.218 --> 00:53.121
BUT, HEY, DIANE SURE IS
A GOOD-LOOKING BROAD.

00:53.154 --> 00:54.255
YEAH. IT'S
EASY FOR HER.

00:54.288 --> 00:55.756
NOT LIKE WHEN
I WAS A BRIDE

00:55.789 --> 00:57.491
AND I HAD TO HOLD
MY BABY IN ONE HAND

00:57.525 --> 00:59.093
AND TOSS THE BOUQUET
WITH THE OTHER.

00:59.127 --> 01:00.794
YOU KNOW, WE HAD
A GREAT TIME
AT OUR WEDDING.

01:00.828 --> 01:03.597
YEAH. YOU WEREN'T
BREAST-FEEDING LILY.

01:03.631 --> 01:05.599
WHAT DID
YOU SAY?

01:06.300 --> 01:07.735
HEY, UH...

01:07.768 --> 01:10.338
WE WERE JUST--
WE WERE TALKING--

01:10.371 --> 01:11.639
WHAT DID YOU HEAR?

01:11.672 --> 01:12.273
I HEARD YOU SAY

01:12.306 --> 01:14.542
THAT I WAS
AT YOUR WEDDING.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.310
NO. UH...

01:16.344 --> 01:17.211
THE THOUGHT...

01:17.245 --> 01:19.180
OF HAVING SOMEBODY
LIKE YOU--

01:19.213 --> 01:22.150
THAT'S WHAT WE WERE
TALKING ABOUT.
THE PROSPECT OF--

01:22.183 --> 01:22.950
EXACTLY. YEAH.

01:22.983 --> 01:25.319
SO YOU BREAST-FED
THE THOUGHT OF ME?

01:25.353 --> 01:25.953
YES.

01:25.986 --> 01:27.821
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU HAD ME

01:27.855 --> 01:29.390
BEFORE YOU
WERE MARRIED.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.892
MY WHOLE LIFE
IS A LIE!

01:33.727 --> 01:35.396
I'M GONNA SKIP
THE HORS D'OEUVRES TABLE

01:35.429 --> 01:36.564
AND GO STRAIGHT
TO THE BAR.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.599
I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

01:51.579 --> 01:52.680
LILY, LILY.
COME ON, LILY.

01:52.713 --> 01:53.314
LET ME EXPLAIN.

01:53.347 --> 01:54.715
WHAT IS THERE
TO EXPLAIN?

01:54.748 --> 01:56.450
YOU TOLD ME
YOU FELL IN LOVE,

01:56.484 --> 01:57.251
YOU GOT MARRIED,

01:57.285 --> 01:59.220
AND I WAS THE PRODUCT
OF YOUR LOVE.

01:59.253 --> 02:00.254
IT'S ALL A LIE!

02:00.288 --> 02:00.921
NO, IT'S NOT.

02:00.954 --> 02:01.722
THOSE THINGS HAPPENED,

02:01.755 --> 02:05.393
JUST, UH, NOT EXACTLY
IN THAT ORDER.

02:07.661 --> 02:08.696
WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO?

02:08.729 --> 02:12.400
LOU AND RACHEL ARE GONNA
GO SEE RAMBO AGAIN.

02:12.433 --> 02:13.133
YOU WANNA GO?

02:13.167 --> 02:15.769
WE COULD DO THAT,
OR WE COULD...

02:15.803 --> 02:18.539
STAY HERE AND DO IT.

02:18.572 --> 02:19.840
YEAH.

02:21.242 --> 02:22.710
PUT SOME MUSIC ON.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.512
ALL RIGHT, OK.

02:27.715 --> 02:31.452
OH, YEAH. OH,
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

02:32.553 --> 02:33.421
OH...

02:33.454 --> 02:34.555
OH, MY GOSH!

02:34.588 --> 02:35.289
SHH!

02:35.323 --> 02:35.956
DON'T "SHH" ME.
I WAS CONCEIVED

02:35.989 --> 02:38.859
IN THE BACK
OF A CHEVY NOVA.

02:39.627 --> 02:40.561
LILY...

02:40.594 --> 02:42.363
BABY, IT MIGHT NOT SEEM
VERY ROMANTIC TO YOU,

02:42.396 --> 02:46.300
BUT WE WERE VERY MUCH
IN LOVE THAT NIGHT.

02:46.334 --> 02:47.568
EWWWW!

02:47.601 --> 02:49.503
LILY, COME ON!

02:50.904 --> 02:51.972
HEY, CLAUDIA.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.507
HEY, AMY.

02:53.541 --> 02:54.642
NICE WEDDING, RIGHT?

02:54.675 --> 02:55.343
YEAH, YEAH.

02:55.376 --> 02:58.746
THAT--THAT SQUAB
WAS FANTASTIC.

02:58.779 --> 02:59.913
SQUAB?

02:59.947 --> 03:01.715
WE THOUGHT
IT WAS VEAL.

03:01.749 --> 03:02.716
HUH.

03:02.750 --> 03:03.751
HMM.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.253
HEY, EDDIE.

03:05.286 --> 03:07.221
YEAH, HEY.

03:07.255 --> 03:08.689
HEY...

03:08.722 --> 03:10.591
I WAS JUST THINKING,

03:10.624 --> 03:11.792
UH, THE FAGENS
DIDN'T COME,

03:11.825 --> 03:13.361
SO THERE'S SPACE
AT OUR TABLE

03:13.394 --> 03:14.562
IF YOU WANT
TO COME OVER.

03:14.595 --> 03:15.696
THANKS, BUT, UM...

03:15.729 --> 03:17.998
YOU KNOW, I'M--I'M HERE.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.701
AND I ALREADY
UNFOLDED MY NAPKIN.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.603
OH, I'M SURE YOU CAN
BRING YOUR NAPKIN OVER.

03:22.636 --> 03:24.738
I MEAN, IF YOU WANT,
I CAN TALK TO SOMEBODY.

03:24.772 --> 03:27.675
UH, THANKS,
I'M--I'M GOOD.

03:27.708 --> 03:28.642
WELL...

03:28.676 --> 03:30.611
IF YOU CHANGE
YOUR MIND...

03:30.644 --> 03:32.846
UH, WE'RE
RIGHT OVER THERE

03:32.880 --> 03:34.448
PAST THE CASH BAR.

03:34.482 --> 03:35.549
ALL RIGHT.

03:35.583 --> 03:36.950
OK.

03:39.653 --> 03:40.788
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:41.755 --> 03:43.657
I THINK AMY LIKES YOU.

03:43.691 --> 03:46.894
I'M LIKABLE.
I GOT A THING.

03:47.495 --> 03:49.763
YOU SLEPT WITH HER,
DIDN'T YOU?

03:49.797 --> 03:51.965
I JUST MET HER
YESTERDAY.

03:51.999 --> 03:52.733
SO?

03:52.766 --> 03:54.668
IT WAS JUST ONCE.

03:54.702 --> 03:55.969
YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.905
THERE IS NO ONE
ON THIS PLANET

03:57.938 --> 03:59.907
MORE VULNERABLE THAN
A SINGLE BRIDESMAID.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.942
HEY, I WAS THE ONE
WHO WAS VULNERABLE.

04:01.975 --> 04:03.977
SHE CAME UP TO ME.

04:04.778 --> 04:06.947
DO YOU REALIZE I'M
THE ONLY BRIDESMAID HERE

04:06.980 --> 04:08.882
THAT ISN'T MARRIED?

04:09.583 --> 04:10.851
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

04:10.884 --> 04:12.653
I MEAN, I'M
PRETTIER THAN HER...

04:12.686 --> 04:13.787
NICER THAN HER...

04:13.821 --> 04:16.990
EASIER THAN HER.

04:18.592 --> 04:19.827
DON'T WORRY.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.662
YOU'LL BE NEXT.

04:21.695 --> 04:23.731
I KNOW IT.

04:25.766 --> 04:26.934
HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT?

04:26.967 --> 04:28.769
WHAT DID I SAY?
SHE TO BE NEXT.

04:28.802 --> 04:31.505
SHE'S THE ONLY ONE LEFT.

04:31.539 --> 04:32.540
DO THE MATH.

04:32.573 --> 04:33.307
EDDIE, YOU--

04:33.341 --> 04:34.775
Sean: LILY, THIS
IS NOT A BIG DEAL.

04:34.808 --> 04:36.677
OH, WELL, IF IT'S
NOT SUCH A BIG DEAL,

04:36.710 --> 04:38.846
WHY DID YOU LIE TO ME
ALL THESE YEARS?

04:38.879 --> 04:40.414
SWEETIE,
IT WAS JUST EASIER.

04:40.448 --> 04:41.949
THE TRUTH WAS
MUCH TOO COMPLEX

04:41.982 --> 04:42.850
TO EXPLAIN
TO A LITTLE GIRL.

04:42.883 --> 04:45.619
LOOK, WE DIDN'T EXPECT
TO HAVE A BABY THEN.

04:45.653 --> 04:46.687
I WAS A SENIOR
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.022
I HAD A LOT OF THINGS
ON MY PLATE.

04:51.559 --> 04:53.527
HEY, SEAN.

04:53.561 --> 04:54.628
HEY, BABY.

04:54.662 --> 04:55.629
HEY. CAN WE, UM,

04:55.663 --> 04:57.030
UM, HEY, EDDIE,

04:57.064 --> 04:57.998
CAN WE, UM,
HAVE A MINUTE?

04:58.031 --> 05:00.968
OH, NO, SEAN. SHE WANTS
TO SING FOR THE BAND.

05:01.001 --> 05:01.835
EDDIE...

05:01.869 --> 05:04.104
ALL RIGHT, BUT JUST
REMEMBER ONE THING.

05:04.137 --> 05:07.475
THIS BAND AIN'T
KATRINA AND THE WAVES.

05:08.509 --> 05:11.011
I'M SO SURE.

05:11.779 --> 05:13.714
HEY, BABY. I'VE
BEEN THINKING ABOUT--

05:13.747 --> 05:15.816
SEAN, I'M PREGNANT.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.751
HUH?

05:17.785 --> 05:19.887
YEAH.

05:20.388 --> 05:22.556
COULD YOU TURN OFF
THE DRUM MACHINE?

05:22.590 --> 05:23.957
YEAH, UM, YEAH.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.359
OH, UH...

05:25.393 --> 05:27.761
UH, YEAH. UH...

05:29.162 --> 05:29.830
ARE YOU SURE?

05:29.863 --> 05:32.700
YEAH. I TOOK
5 PREGNANCY TESTS,

05:32.733 --> 05:33.767
AND THEY WERE ALL PINK.

05:33.801 --> 05:34.535
WAIT, WAIT. I MEAN,

05:34.568 --> 05:36.370
I THINK BLUE MEANS
YOU'RE PREGNANT.

05:36.404 --> 05:38.071
YOU THINK I DIDN'T READ
THE FRIGGIN' BOX?

05:38.105 --> 05:40.474
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE YOU TOOK
THE TEST WRONG!

05:40.508 --> 05:42.075
IT'S NOT
THE S.A.T., SEAN.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.010
YOU PEE ON IT!

05:43.043 --> 05:45.078
WELL, MAYBE SOMETHING'S
WRONG WITH YOUR PEE.

05:45.112 --> 05:46.013
YEAH, THERE IS.

05:46.046 --> 05:47.515
I'M PEEING FOR TWO.

05:47.548 --> 05:48.549
OH, GOD!

05:48.582 --> 05:50.618
OH, OH...

05:50.651 --> 05:53.921
OK. HEY, IT'S COOL.
IT'S TOTALLY COOL.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.389
GAAAA!

05:55.423 --> 05:57.591
YOU WERE SUCH A PIG.

05:57.625 --> 05:58.759
YEP.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.528
I WAS 17.

06:00.561 --> 06:01.462
HEY, YOU GUYS.

06:01.495 --> 06:03.163
GOT A LITTLE WEDDING
WISH FOR JOE AND DIANE?

06:03.196 --> 06:05.098
OH, YEAH.
JOE, DIANE,

06:05.132 --> 06:05.933
CONGRATULATIONS.

06:05.966 --> 06:08.135
OH, AND BY THE WAY,
I'M ILLEGITIMATE.

06:08.168 --> 06:08.969
MR. FINNERTY HERE?

06:09.002 --> 06:11.572
HE SAYS HE'S MY FATHER,
BUT WHO KNOWS?

06:11.605 --> 06:13.073
SO, I HOPE I'M
NOT RUINING--

06:13.106 --> 06:14.808
HEY, UM, HEY.
YOU KNOW, CAN--

06:14.842 --> 06:16.043
YOU CAN REWIND THAT,
CAN'T YOU?

06:16.076 --> 06:16.844
BECAUSE THIS IS--

06:16.877 --> 06:18.579
YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST GIVE ME THE TAPE.

06:18.612 --> 06:19.547
GIVE ME THE TAPE.

06:19.580 --> 06:20.814
GIVE ME THE TAPE, MAN!

06:20.848 --> 06:22.816
DON'T MAKE A SCENE.

06:22.850 --> 06:25.853
HEY, CAN YOU POINT ME
TO THE MEN'S ROOM?

06:26.554 --> 06:27.855
EDDIE?

06:28.221 --> 06:30.591
SO, YOU CAME
TO SIT WITH US.

06:30.624 --> 06:32.059
SO, YOU'RE EDDIE.

06:32.092 --> 06:33.794
THAT'S ME.

06:33.827 --> 06:34.662
OH, UM...

06:34.695 --> 06:35.763
LET ME GET
A PICTURE OF YOU

06:35.796 --> 06:36.897
AND YOUR BOYFRIEND, AMY.

06:36.930 --> 06:39.633
YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT HER BOYFRIEND.

06:45.105 --> 06:45.939
BUT...

06:45.973 --> 06:48.175
WHY DON'T I GET
A PICTURE OF YOU FOLKS?

06:51.579 --> 06:53.881
SMILE.

06:54.848 --> 06:57.017
THAT'S GONNA BE
A NICE SHOT.

07:00.754 --> 07:03.824
HEY, LOOK WHAT THEY'RE
GIVING AWAY FOR FREE.

07:03.857 --> 07:05.158
COOL, HUH?

07:05.192 --> 07:06.960
GREAT.

07:06.994 --> 07:07.861
STOP IT.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.463
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

07:09.497 --> 07:12.633
I JUST FOUND OUT
I'M A BASTARD.

07:12.666 --> 07:13.266
DON'T WORRY.

07:13.300 --> 07:14.201
DAD SAYS
HIS BOSS IS,
TOO.

07:14.234 --> 07:17.638
YEAH, AND THAT GUY
WHO TOOK OUR PARKING SPACE

07:17.671 --> 07:18.371
AT THE MALL.

07:18.405 --> 07:20.808
OH, I WAS ONE
WHEN I HIT GRANDPA

07:20.841 --> 07:23.043
WITH A WHIFFLE BALL BAT.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.679
GO AWAY! GO.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.550
I HOPE THEIR VOWS
WEREN'T ON THIS THING.

07:29.583 --> 07:32.853
NOW I KNOW WHY I'VE
NEVER SEEN THE TAPE
OF YOUR WEDDING.

07:32.886 --> 07:33.887
'CAUSE I WAS ON IT!

07:33.921 --> 07:36.557
LILY, IT WAS COMPLICATED.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.560
YOU ALL RIGHT?

07:40.928 --> 07:43.597
I CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT.

07:48.035 --> 07:50.103
CLAUDIA'S PREGNANT, MAN.

07:51.271 --> 07:52.239
NO WAY.

07:52.272 --> 07:54.007
THAT'S ILL.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.776
I'M TOO YOUNG
TO BE AN UNCLE.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.145
HEY, I'M GONNA BE
A FATHER, DUMBASS.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.047
OH, JEEZ,
THAT'S HEAVY, TOO.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.048
YEAH.

08:01.081 --> 08:01.915
DON'T TELL ANYBODY.

08:01.949 --> 08:04.752
WHO AM I GONNA TELL?

08:06.019 --> 08:09.089
YO, MAN, GUESS WHO'S
GONNA BE AN UNCLE, MAN.

08:09.122 --> 08:10.257
NO WAY.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.225
YEAH.
OH...

08:12.259 --> 08:15.028
GUESS WHAT.
SEAN FINNERTY...

08:15.062 --> 08:17.998
KNOCKED UP
CLAUDIA BUSTAMANTE.

08:21.569 --> 08:22.636
TSK TSK TSK TSK.

08:22.670 --> 08:25.806
I WISH I WERE SURPRISED.

08:29.877 --> 08:31.845
HEY, CONGRATULATIONS,
GRANDPA.

08:31.879 --> 08:33.113
WHAT?

08:33.146 --> 08:35.282
WHAT WAS THAT?

08:38.318 --> 08:38.952
COME ON, MADONNA.

08:38.986 --> 08:41.021
IT'S CALLED
A LADY GILLETTE.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.990
EDDIE!

08:43.023 --> 08:44.057
DID YOU TELL ANYBODY?

08:44.091 --> 08:45.158
WAS I NOT SUPPOSED TO?

08:45.192 --> 08:45.959
NO.

08:45.993 --> 08:46.760
WELL, I DIDN'T.

08:46.794 --> 08:48.662
GOD, MAN. SOMEHOW
THE WORD GOT OUT,

08:48.696 --> 08:50.130
AND I DON'T KNOW,
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

08:50.163 --> 08:52.299
WELL, YOU GOT NO CHOICE.

08:53.867 --> 08:54.702
YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:54.735 --> 08:57.104
YOU'VE GOTTA RUN AWAY.

08:57.137 --> 08:59.707
I'M NOT GONNA RUN AWAY.

09:00.307 --> 09:01.975
I'M GONNA MARRY HER.

09:02.009 --> 09:03.043
OH, MAN.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.878
YEP. I HAVE TO, MAN.

09:04.912 --> 09:05.946
I GOTTA DO
THE RIGHT THING.

09:05.979 --> 09:10.684
THERE YOU ARE,
YOU IRRESPONSIBLE
GOOD-FOR-NOTHING!

09:10.718 --> 09:11.652
DAD, LISTEN, OK?

09:11.685 --> 09:12.620
I'VE MADE A DECISION.

09:12.653 --> 09:14.955
NO, NO. YOU'VE
BEEN MAKING ALL
YOUR DECISIONS

09:14.988 --> 09:16.123
FROM SOUTH OF
THE BELT BUCKLE.

09:16.156 --> 09:17.124
NOW, I'M MAKING
A DECISION.

09:17.157 --> 09:19.126
YOU ARE MARRYING
THAT POOR GIRL.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.928
YEAH, DAD.
THAT WAS MY DECISION.

09:20.961 --> 09:22.830
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT
THAT'S YOUR DECISION,

09:22.863 --> 09:25.098
AND YOU'RE NOT
GETTING OUT OF IT!

09:26.399 --> 09:27.935
SO LONG, GRAMPY.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.070
AND YOU SHUT UP!

09:34.207 --> 09:36.910
HI, WELCOME TO BENNETTON.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.755
CLAUDIA...

09:48.055 --> 09:49.056
WE SHOULD TALK.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.024
I'M LISTENING.

09:51.058 --> 09:53.226
I ACTED LIKE A REAL
BIG JERK YESTERDAY.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.795
YES, YOU DID.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.964
AND I WAS TOTALLY WRONG.

09:58.732 --> 10:02.035
AND I THINK
WE SHOULD GET MARRIED.

10:02.369 --> 10:03.837
REALLY?

10:03.871 --> 10:05.272
YEAH.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.207
OH, SEAN.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.177
OH, BABY, I MADE
A BIG MISTAKE,

10:10.210 --> 10:12.179
AND IT'S TIME
I PAID FOR IT.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.717
SO, I'M THE PUNISHMENT?

10:16.750 --> 10:17.885
OH, NO.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.019
NO, NOT YOU, BABY.

10:19.052 --> 10:20.087
MARRIAGE.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.121
OH...

10:21.154 --> 10:22.856
SO, LET'S JUST
GET ON THE PHONE
WITH YOUR PARENTS,

10:22.890 --> 10:23.924
GET THE BALL ROLLING--

10:23.957 --> 10:25.659
GET OUT.
WHAT?

10:25.693 --> 10:27.761
GET OUT OF MY BENNETTON!

10:27.795 --> 10:30.130
BUT I THOUGHT YOU
WANTED TO MARRY ME!

10:30.163 --> 10:31.231
YEAH, SO DID I.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.266
CLAUDIA, COME ON!

10:33.300 --> 10:34.167
JUST GO!

10:34.201 --> 10:35.102
GET--MOVE IT!

10:35.135 --> 10:37.070
GET OUT!
CLAUDIA!

10:37.404 --> 10:38.305
CLAUD!

10:38.338 --> 10:39.372
SECURITY!

10:39.406 --> 10:41.074
UH...

10:55.022 --> 10:55.889
HEY.

10:56.857 --> 10:59.960
YOU KNOW, MY DAUGHTER'S
VERY SPECIAL TO ME.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.830
THAT'S AN EXCELLENT
QUALITY.

11:02.863 --> 11:03.897
I THINK SHE'D
BE VERY PLEASED

11:03.931 --> 11:05.999
IF YOU ASKED HER
TO DANCE.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.702
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
THIS IS A BATHROOM.

11:08.736 --> 11:10.237
I GOT STUFF
TO DO IN HERE.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.772
WELL, I THOUGHT
WE SHOULD TALK

11:11.805 --> 11:13.106
AWAY FROM THE WOMEN.

11:13.140 --> 11:16.276
YEAH, BUT I HAVE WHAT
YOU CALL A SHY BLADDER.

11:16.309 --> 11:17.477
YOU KNOW,
I CAN'T REALLY--

11:17.510 --> 11:18.245
I CAN'T REALLY GO

11:18.278 --> 11:20.313
WITH SOMEBODY
WATCHING, YOU KNOW.

11:20.347 --> 11:23.784
WELL, I CERTAINLY DON'T
WANT TO PUT YOU OUT.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.087
I WAS JUST HOPING
FOR AN ANSWER.

11:27.487 --> 11:29.389
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

11:29.422 --> 11:31.324
I'LL ASK HER TO DANCE.

11:32.292 --> 11:35.128
COULD YOU LOOK AWAY NOW?

11:36.529 --> 11:40.233
HEY, TAKE A PICTURE OF ME
WITH ALL THESE CAMERAS.

11:40.267 --> 11:41.301
LET'S GO
IN THE BATHROOM

11:41.334 --> 11:42.335
AND TAKE PICTURES
OF OUR BUTTS.

11:42.369 --> 11:45.806
I'M GONNA TAKE, LIKE,
5 CAMERAS' WORTH OF MY BUTT.

11:45.839 --> 11:49.442
HEY, THERE'LL BE
NO TAKING PICTURES
OF YOUR BUTTS.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.845
LET'S JUST SNAP AWAY
UNDER THE STALLS

11:51.879 --> 11:53.280
AND SEE WHAT
WE COME UP WITH.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.782
COOL.

11:55.916 --> 11:56.850
HEY, LILY. YOU OK?

11:56.884 --> 11:58.418
YOU MEAN OK
WITH MY BIRTH
BEING THE PRODUCT

11:58.451 --> 12:01.822
OF 2 PEOPLE'S
UTTER CONTEMPT
FOR EACH OTHER?

12:01.855 --> 12:02.722
YEAH, I'M GOLDEN.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.958
LOOK, OK. THERE WAS
VERY LITTLE CONTEMPT.

12:04.992 --> 12:06.760
WE WERE JUST, UH...

12:06.794 --> 12:08.728
ESTRANGED.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.497
NO, WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU ASKED HER,

12:10.530 --> 12:11.799
AND SHE SAID NO?

12:11.832 --> 12:13.100
SHE SAID NO.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.968
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

12:15.002 --> 12:15.735
YO...

12:15.769 --> 12:18.071
SHE'S ON HER PERIOD
OR SOMETHING.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.239
I DON'T THINK SO.

12:19.272 --> 12:20.507
Lou: THAT'S COOL, MAN.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.876
YOU ASKED HER.
SHE SAID NO.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.011
YOU'RE FREE.

12:24.044 --> 12:24.812
ROCK ON.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.513
THAT'S IT, MAN.
I'M FREE TO ROCK ON!

12:26.546 --> 12:28.081
YOU'D BE A FOOL
TO NOT ROCK ON.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.784
MAN, I'M FULLY ENTITLED
TO JUST ROCK ON!

12:30.818 --> 12:33.486
THEN I'M GONNA PARTY!

12:33.520 --> 12:34.788
AND FORGET CLAUDIA.

12:34.822 --> 12:36.890
FORGET HER.
SHE'S NOTHING.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.158
YO, COME ON, MAN.

12:38.191 --> 12:38.926
COME ON, COME ON.

12:38.959 --> 12:41.261
I'M COOL, I'M COOL,
MAN. I'M COOL.

12:41.294 --> 12:42.495
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

12:42.529 --> 12:43.864
I GOT NO PROBLEM, MAN.

12:43.897 --> 12:45.465
I CAN JUST HAVE
ANY CHICK I WANT.

12:45.498 --> 12:48.068
MAN, I COULD--
I COULD HAVE HER.

12:48.101 --> 12:48.869
KASEY?

12:48.902 --> 12:50.170
YEAH, YEAH, KASEY.

12:50.203 --> 12:51.004
SHE WANTS ME, MAN.

12:51.038 --> 12:53.941
SHE WANTS ME...BAD.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.043
ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT ME?

12:56.076 --> 12:56.910
YEAH.

12:56.944 --> 12:59.579
COME HERE. I WANT
TO ASK YOU A QUESTION.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.848
WHAT?

13:00.881 --> 13:02.549
EVERYBODY KNOWS
THAT YOU LIKE ME.

13:02.582 --> 13:04.484
THAT'S NOT A QUESTION.

13:04.517 --> 13:07.454
OK, UH, DO YOU KNOW
THAT YOU LIKE ME?

13:07.487 --> 13:09.422
YEAH.

13:15.996 --> 13:18.365
ROCK ON.

13:26.273 --> 13:27.875
UNH!

13:27.908 --> 13:30.810
AUGH! OHH...

13:39.352 --> 13:39.853
KASEY?

13:39.887 --> 13:42.923
WHO THE HELL IS KASEY?

13:44.491 --> 13:47.060
YOU TOLD ME KASEY WAS
THE NAME OF YOUR DOG.

13:47.094 --> 13:49.096
MM-HMM. THAT'S NOT
ENTIRELY INACCURATE.

13:49.129 --> 13:52.099
HAVE YOU EVER TOLD ME
THE TRUTH ABOUT ANYTHING?

13:52.132 --> 13:53.200
S-SOMETIMES.

13:53.233 --> 13:56.103
LOOK, THIS WAS ONE
OF THOSE REALLY
GOOD, SOLID LIES--

13:56.136 --> 13:59.472
THE KIND THAT YOU CAN
BUILD A FAMILY AROUND.

13:59.506 --> 14:00.640
LOOK, AMY, I'M
LEAVING THIS MESSAGE,

14:00.673 --> 14:02.442
BECAUSE IF I TOLD YOU
HERE AT THE WEDDING,

14:02.475 --> 14:05.212
YOU'D FREAK OUT AND
EVERYONE WOULD LOOK AT ME.

14:05.245 --> 14:07.881
THE THING IS...

14:07.915 --> 14:10.417
YOU KNOW,
WHAT WE HAD WAS...

14:10.450 --> 14:12.852
NOTHING, REALLY.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.123
OH, GOD, HERE YOU COME.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.157
I BETTER HURRY THIS UP.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.625
IT'S ME. IT'S NOT YOU.

14:18.658 --> 14:20.560
I HOPE WE CAN
STILL BE FRIENDS.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.529
DON'T CALL ME.

14:24.664 --> 14:26.333
AMY.

14:26.666 --> 14:28.335
HELLO, EDDIE. UM...

14:28.368 --> 14:29.569
LISTEN, I OWE YOU
AN APOLOGY.

14:29.602 --> 14:30.904
I JUST FOUND OUT
THAT MY DAD

14:30.938 --> 14:33.040
CORNERED YOU
IN THE CAN.

14:33.073 --> 14:34.607
YEAH, THAT'S OK.

14:34.641 --> 14:37.077
NO, IT'S NOT OK.

14:37.110 --> 14:40.013
I'VE BEEN ACTING LIKE
A TOTAL PSYCHO ALL NIGHT,

14:40.047 --> 14:41.148
AND I'M...
REALLY EMBARRASSED.

14:41.181 --> 14:43.984
AND IF YOU NEVER WANT
TO SEE ME AGAIN,

14:44.017 --> 14:44.817
I UNDERSTAND.

14:44.851 --> 14:46.619
IT'S JUST THAT YOU'RE
SUCH A COOL GUY,

14:46.653 --> 14:47.988
AND YOU'RE...

14:48.021 --> 14:50.423
SO SEXY, AND...

14:50.991 --> 14:54.194
OH, BOY. I JUST HOPE
I DIDN'T BLOW IT.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.129
NAH.

14:58.331 --> 14:59.632
I HAVE TO MAKE
A PHONE CALL.

14:59.666 --> 15:01.234
DO YOU MIND?

15:12.379 --> 15:12.980
HEY, AMY.

15:13.013 --> 15:15.648
FORGET THAT
LAST MESSAGE.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.251
FORGET IT.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.054
HOW COULD YOU HAVE
MARRIED HIM AT ALL?

15:21.088 --> 15:23.656
HE'S GOT THE NAME
OF THE LOCAL SLUT
ON HIS ARM.

15:23.690 --> 15:26.059
MM-HMM. OUR DAUGHTER ASKS
A VERY GOOD QUESTION.

15:26.093 --> 15:30.030
LOOK, I JUST NEEDED
TO GET MY PRIORITIES
STRAIGHT.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.300
OH...

15:33.333 --> 15:34.968
DAD?

15:35.002 --> 15:36.469
YOU'RE UP.

15:36.503 --> 15:37.470
MM-HMM.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.706
I MADE YOU
A CUP OF COFFEE.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.208
OH...

15:42.042 --> 15:43.310
OH...

15:44.077 --> 15:45.478
SO, YOU KNEW
I WAS OUT THERE?

15:45.512 --> 15:48.948
WHO DO YOU THINK TURNED
ON THE SPRINKLER?

15:49.782 --> 15:51.218
WHAT WAS I GONNA DO?

15:51.251 --> 15:53.053
LET YOUR MOTHER
FIND YOU OUT THERE

15:53.086 --> 15:55.522
IN YOUR TIGHTY

15:57.557 --> 15:59.592
OH, GOD.

16:00.727 --> 16:03.330
I TAKE IT
CLAUDIA SAID "NO."

16:03.363 --> 16:04.497
YEAH.

16:04.531 --> 16:06.599
YEAH, I FIGURED
AS MUCH WHEN I SAW

16:06.633 --> 16:09.736
YOU GOT A MAN'S NAME
TATTOOED ON YOUR ARM.

16:09.769 --> 16:12.472
OH, KASEY, UH,
IS A GIRL.

16:12.505 --> 16:14.007
YOU'RE SURE ABOUT THAT?

16:14.041 --> 16:15.508
YEAH.

16:16.043 --> 16:18.145
GOD, I HOPE SO.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.781
JEEZ, DAD.
WHAT WAS I THINKING?

16:21.814 --> 16:24.051
GOD, I'M SO STUPID.

16:24.084 --> 16:27.020
AND I DON'T EVEN
KNOW THIS GIRL.

16:27.054 --> 16:28.521
I DON'T HAVE
CLAUDIA'S NAME

16:28.555 --> 16:29.622
TATTOOED ON MY ARM,

16:29.656 --> 16:30.490
AND I LOVE HER.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.492
DID YOU EVER
TELL HER THAT?

16:33.493 --> 16:34.461
NO.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.029
OH.

16:36.063 --> 16:37.497
WELL, SOME GUYS
INCLUDE THAT

16:37.530 --> 16:38.665
AS PART
OF THE PROPOSAL,

16:38.698 --> 16:40.533
BUT THEN,
WHAT DO I KNOW?

16:40.567 --> 16:41.601
LOOK, JUST KEEP
GETTING THE NAMES

16:41.634 --> 16:43.703
OF TRAMPS TATTOOED
ALL OVER YOUR BODY,

16:43.736 --> 16:46.606
AND EVENTUALLY YOU
CAN JOIN THE CIRCUS.

16:46.639 --> 16:48.741
YEAH.

16:52.212 --> 16:53.146
HI, CLAUD.

16:53.180 --> 16:54.781
HI, WELCOME TO BENNETTON.

16:54.814 --> 16:55.715
NOW GET OUT.

16:55.748 --> 16:57.417
PLEASE, JUST GIVE ME
2 MINUTES OF YOUR TIME.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.119
I'M BUSY.

16:59.152 --> 17:00.153
WELL, I'M
NOT GONNA LEAVE

17:00.187 --> 17:01.020
UNTIL YOU TALK TO ME.

17:01.054 --> 17:03.056
WELL, THEN YOU'RE
GONNA BE HERE A WHILE.

17:03.090 --> 17:04.191
FINE.
FINE.

17:04.224 --> 17:06.093
FINE.
FINE.

17:06.493 --> 17:09.196
I GOT ALL DAY.

17:35.255 --> 17:36.689
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

17:36.723 --> 17:39.159
WELL, UH, WHAT I REALLY
WANT TO DO IS PEE,

17:39.192 --> 17:42.129
BUT BEFORE THAT, I WANT
TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

17:42.162 --> 17:43.396
OK?

17:47.567 --> 17:48.735
KASEY?

17:48.768 --> 17:49.602
YEAH.

17:49.636 --> 17:52.105
W-WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU?

17:52.139 --> 17:53.640
CLAUD, IT'S A SYMBOL.

17:53.673 --> 17:54.607
IT MEANS SOMETHING.

17:54.641 --> 17:56.143
IT MEANS
YOU NAILED KASEY!

17:56.176 --> 17:57.877
NO, NO. IT MEANS
I'M AN IDIOT!

17:57.910 --> 17:59.879
BUT SHE IS
SUCH A SKANK.

17:59.912 --> 18:00.813
HOW COULD YOU?

18:00.847 --> 18:02.815
I DIDN'T.
I WAS TOO DRUNK.

18:02.849 --> 18:03.750
OH, WELL.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.852
THIS JUST KEEPS GETTING
MORE ROMANTIC, SEAN.

18:05.885 --> 18:08.221
LOOK, CLAUD, WHEN
YOU FIRST CAME TO ME

18:08.255 --> 18:09.356
WITH THE NEWS, OK,

18:09.389 --> 18:10.457
I PANICKED.

18:10.490 --> 18:11.291
AND I WAS SELFISH,

18:11.324 --> 18:12.024
AND THEN I TRIED
TO MAKE THINGS BETTER,

18:12.058 --> 18:13.793
AND I ONLY
MADE THINGS WORSE,

18:13.826 --> 18:15.728
AND THEN I WENT OUT,
AND I WANTED TO PROVE

18:15.762 --> 18:17.130
THAT I COULD LIVE
WITHOUT YOU,

18:17.164 --> 18:19.866
AND I PROVED
THE EXACT OPPOSITE.

18:19.899 --> 18:23.903
I DO STUPID THINGS
WHEN I'M NOT WITH YOU,
CLAUDIA.

18:23.936 --> 18:27.607
AND I CAN'T AFFORD
TO GET ANY STUPIDER.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.242
NO ARGUMENT THERE.

18:29.276 --> 18:33.213
AND I LOVE YOU.

18:33.246 --> 18:34.547
I LOVE YOU.

18:34.581 --> 18:36.149
AND YOU HAVE
TO MARRY ME,

18:36.183 --> 18:37.317
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.786
NO. NO, I'M NOT
GONNA MARRY YOU

18:39.819 --> 18:40.687
BECAUSE I HAVE TO.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.855
I'M GONNA MARRY YOU
BECAUSE I WANT TO.

18:42.889 --> 18:44.691
YES!
NO.

18:44.724 --> 18:47.627
NO, NOT NOW.
IT'S JUST...

18:47.660 --> 18:49.196
IF WE GOT MARRIED NOW,

18:49.229 --> 18:52.432
IT'S JUST GONNA BE
BECAUSE I'M HAVING A BABY

18:52.465 --> 18:53.200
AND YOU'RE FREAKING OUT.

18:53.233 --> 18:55.302
AND YOU ARE FREAKING OUT.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.170
OK, JUST A LITTLE.

18:57.204 --> 18:58.305
YEAH.

18:58.338 --> 19:01.208
I'M GONNA HAVE
THE BABY, OK?

19:01.241 --> 19:03.210
AND THEN AFTERWARDS,

19:03.243 --> 19:05.745
IF WE STILL WANT
TO GET MARRIED,

19:05.778 --> 19:07.247
THEN GREAT.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.915
BUT IT'LL BE

19:08.948 --> 19:11.918
BECAUSE WE LOVE
EACH OTHER.

19:11.951 --> 19:13.586
OK.

19:17.224 --> 19:18.225
OH...

19:19.659 --> 19:22.229
AND WE WERE MARRIED
8 MONTHS LATER,

19:22.262 --> 19:24.597
WITH YOU IN MY ARMS.

19:24.897 --> 19:26.799
SO, IN A WEIRD WAY,

19:26.833 --> 19:30.203
I'M...THE PROOF
OF YOUR LOVE.

19:30.237 --> 19:31.404
THAT'S IT.
EXACTLY.

19:31.438 --> 19:32.705
AND AS YOUR LIVING PROOF,

19:32.739 --> 19:35.208
I WILL BE FOREVER TARRED
AS A BASTARD.

19:35.242 --> 19:37.310
OK, I WISH YOU WOULD
STOP USING THAT WORD.

19:37.344 --> 19:38.411
DJ: ALL RIGHT,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

19:38.445 --> 19:40.547
IT'S TIME FOR THE
FATHER-DAUGHTER DANCE.

19:40.580 --> 19:41.981
ALL THE FATHERS
AND DAUGHTERS

19:42.014 --> 19:43.416
JOIN THE BRIDE
AND HER FATHER

19:43.450 --> 19:45.952
OUT ON THE DANCE FLOOR.

19:45.985 --> 19:49.756
MIGHT I HAVE
THE EXTREME PLEASURE?

19:49.789 --> 19:52.259
YOU ARE SUCH A DORK.

19:52.292 --> 19:54.361
HEY, I'M YOUR DAD.
I'M ENTITLED.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.864
LET'S GO FREESTYLE.

20:03.470 --> 20:05.004
DAD. DAD, COME ON.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.306
DON'T YOU HAVE
ANY RHYTHM?

20:06.339 --> 20:09.376
WHAT? COME ON.
IT'S YOU.

20:10.042 --> 20:10.943
LOOK.

20:10.977 --> 20:12.679
JUST LET ME LEAD,
ALL RIGHT?

20:12.712 --> 20:14.347
OK.

20:16.015 --> 20:18.351
THIS IS POINTLESS.

20:18.385 --> 20:19.386
LOOK, UH...

20:19.419 --> 20:20.019
GET ON MY FEET.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.554
GET ON MY FEET.
WHAT?

20:21.588 --> 20:23.256
DAD, I HAVEN'T DONE
THAT SINCE I WAS 5.

20:23.290 --> 20:26.293
GET ON MY FEET,
OR I'M GONNA GET ON YOURS.

20:26.993 --> 20:28.728
OK.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.266
OW!

20:33.933 --> 20:36.002
I'M KIDDING.

20:45.378 --> 20:47.480
YOU MIND IF I CUT IN?

20:55.655 --> 20:57.690
SO, I'M SORRY
ABOUT BEFORE.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.326
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

20:59.359 --> 21:00.660
WEDDINGS MAKE
PEOPLE CRAZY.

21:00.693 --> 21:01.761
I HATE 'EM.

21:01.794 --> 21:03.863
ME, TOO.

21:03.896 --> 21:05.698
YOU WANT TO GO
MAKE OUT IN MY CAR?

21:05.732 --> 21:07.500
ABSOLUTELY.

21:10.370 --> 21:13.640
SOMEDAY, I'LL BE DANCING
AT YOUR WEDDING, LILY.

21:13.673 --> 21:15.642
THAT'S SWEET.

21:15.675 --> 21:17.877
JUST DON'T BE PREGNANT.

21:17.910 --> 21:19.412
GRANDPA!

21:23.883 --> 21:25.652
CAN YOU BELIEVE
WE'VE BEEN MARRIED

21:25.685 --> 21:26.853
FOR 15 YEARS?

21:26.886 --> 21:27.687
YES.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.756
NO, I MEAN, EVERYTHING
THAT'S HAPPENED.

21:29.789 --> 21:30.990
3 KIDS.
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

21:31.023 --> 21:35.395
YES. TODAY FEELS
LIKE 15 YEARS.

21:35.428 --> 21:37.096
BUT A GOOD 15 YEARS.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.798
YEAH.

21:39.399 --> 21:40.099
HEY, YOU KIDS!

21:40.132 --> 21:42.635
STOP TAKING PICTURES
OF MY BUTT!

21:42.669 --> 21:45.338
OH, MAN. WE GOTTA
DEAL WITH THAT.

21:45.372 --> 21:46.706
NOT NOW.

21:48.541 --> 21:49.576
COME HERE.
COME HERE.

21:49.609 --> 21:51.844
WHERE ARE
YOUR PARENTS?!

21:57.550 --> 22:01.053
All: 1, 2, 3!

22:01.087 --> 22:02.755
WHOO!

22:04.691 --> 22:07.026
OK, DO OVER.

22:09.896 --> 22:11.698
I'M NEXT!

22:13.433 --> 22:14.501
WHOO!

22:14.534 --> 22:16.035
WHOO!

22:16.068 --> 22:18.605
I'M NEXT!

22:23.142 --> 22:25.344
EDDIE?
