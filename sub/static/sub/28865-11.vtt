Uh-oh.

00:31.976 --> 00:33.131
We don't have time
for this stupid

00:33.218 --> 00:34.412
Carnovolo dinner,
alright?

00:34.500 --> 00:35.922
Quinn could be dying,
and we still have

00:36.009 --> 00:37.477
dimensional keys
that we got to collect.

00:37.564 --> 00:39.208
I told them we didn't
have time for this,

00:39.296 --> 00:40.371
and they got pissed.

00:40.459 --> 00:42.068
I'm just honored
to be invited.

00:42.156 --> 00:45.396
I made my first greeting card.
Here, take a look.

00:46.169 --> 00:47.586
What the hell
does that even say?

00:47.673 --> 00:50.242
I don't know. I can't write.
Do you want to sign it?

00:50.330 --> 00:51.804
No, I don't want to sign it.
There's no room.

00:51.891 --> 00:54.037
I mean, it's front and back
with just gibberish.

00:54.125 --> 00:56.654
Not just gibberish...
Touching gibberish.

00:56.747 --> 00:58.149
Hey, I'll sign it!

01:00.887 --> 01:02.445
I'm showing my face
and ghosting.

01:02.552 --> 01:04.989
Happy Carnovolo!

01:05.138 --> 01:08.370
Diet Lemon Lime
Dart Juice?

01:08.458 --> 01:09.988
Throw it in
the sacred fire.

01:10.076 --> 01:12.537
Okay. Now I'm gonna leave
and not say bye to anybody.

01:42.991 --> 01:44.216
Before we eat,

01:44.304 --> 01:47.101
first we lavish praise
on each other.

01:47.188 --> 01:48.984
It's tradition.

01:49.087 --> 01:51.796
I lavish praise on Mooncake! Ah!

01:51.884 --> 01:55.110
The best pal a deep-space
insanity-avoidance companion

01:55.198 --> 01:56.487
can have.

01:56.757 --> 01:58.867
- Chookity, pok, pok.
- My turn.

01:58.955 --> 02:00.880
I lavish praise on you.

02:00.968 --> 02:03.294
Me? It's been
a long time coming.

02:03.382 --> 02:05.499
I find you adorable,

02:05.587 --> 02:07.247
and don't let that
go to your motherboard.

02:07.335 --> 02:09.195
This is what
I've been waiting for,

02:09.310 --> 02:11.140
so why do I feel
so empty?

02:11.228 --> 02:12.239
My turn.

02:12.327 --> 02:15.302
I lavish praise on...

02:15.552 --> 02:16.606
Nightfall.

02:16.694 --> 02:18.269
What the freak, Ash?

02:18.381 --> 02:21.577
Anyone you'd like to lavish
with praise, Ashy,

02:21.665 --> 02:24.653
because of his delectable
delightfulness?

02:24.741 --> 02:26.001
Uh, sure.

02:26.089 --> 02:27.435
You're my dad,

02:27.523 --> 02:29.247
which is cool,
I guess.

02:29.335 --> 02:32.156
I don't know what this is.
Is this normal Carnovolo stuff,

02:32.244 --> 02:33.639
or is Clarence just
losing his mind?

02:33.726 --> 02:36.258
Ooh. My turn.
I lavish praise...

02:36.345 --> 02:38.296
Ah.
Mm...

02:38.718 --> 02:41.046
- Yes, my boy?
- ..on KVN.

02:41.134 --> 02:44.231
You're the best talking
microwave I've ever had.

02:44.319 --> 02:45.612
KVN is popular!

02:45.699 --> 02:47.344
- Hooray!
- Aah!

02:47.432 --> 02:48.946
Okay.
Time to get those keys.

02:49.034 --> 02:50.256
Well, this is ridiculous.

02:50.344 --> 02:52.204
Carnovolo is a holiday
I invented

02:52.292 --> 02:54.035
for my own glorification,

02:54.123 --> 02:56.235
and you're bringing me
diet juice drinks,

02:56.323 --> 02:58.249
a cheapo homemade
greeting card,

02:58.337 --> 03:00.649
and now we're getting stingy
on the lavishment?

03:00.737 --> 03:02.467
It's not about
what they brought, Dad.

03:02.555 --> 03:04.868
- They're family.
- They are? We are?

03:04.956 --> 03:07.803
Yeah, why don't you
lavish some praises, Pop Pop?

03:07.947 --> 03:10.491
Dump a hot steamin'
load of lavish

03:10.579 --> 03:12.023
all over Gary's face.

03:12.111 --> 03:14.130
No, that doesn't
sound... no.

03:14.218 --> 03:15.407
Oh, alright.

03:15.495 --> 03:17.102
Uh, primate...

03:17.540 --> 03:21.094
I find you to be...

03:21.182 --> 03:25.099
- No, that's plenty.
- Primate, you are quite the...

03:25.195 --> 03:30.285
- I'll take the "quite the."
- Gary, I find you to be...

03:30.373 --> 03:31.253
I'll finish.

03:31.366 --> 03:34.489
Gary, you're warmhearted
and kind of great.

03:34.576 --> 03:35.907
Well, I've had enough!

03:35.995 --> 03:39.243
Ash, Fox,
you ungrateful mice.

03:39.443 --> 03:40.899
Remember the guy
who saved you,

03:40.987 --> 03:44.076
gave you a home,
filled your carcass stocking,

03:44.164 --> 03:45.938
taught you
how to bake inorganic,

03:46.026 --> 03:47.530
kindness-free toffee?

03:47.618 --> 03:50.571
That was me!
All me!

03:50.659 --> 03:54.079
Am I not deserving of praise?
Well, fine.

03:54.167 --> 03:57.079
Then I bid you both
a dark Carnovolo,

03:57.167 --> 03:59.618
a dark car...

03:59.942 --> 04:01.806
Oh-oh!

04:03.128 --> 04:06.469
I lavish praises on you,
Clarence.

04:06.626 --> 04:07.891
You're so...

04:08.012 --> 04:11.594
You're... You're...
You're so "Clarencey."

04:11.716 --> 04:13.341
You...

04:18.862 --> 04:19.934
Clarence.

04:20.022 --> 04:22.162
Sheryl?
Is it really you?

04:22.250 --> 04:24.365
Have you thought
about my offer?

04:26.628 --> 04:28.256
Yes...

04:28.668 --> 04:29.996
I have.

04:33.381 --> 04:36.068
All of you,
come to the bridge right away.

04:36.155 --> 04:38.076
Can't. We're in the middle
of Carnovolo dinner,

04:38.164 --> 04:40.132
which, by the way, I just found
out they have a yam course.

04:40.219 --> 04:41.670
At least I think
these are yams.

04:41.896 --> 04:44.232
This... This is a marshmallow
on top, right?

04:44.320 --> 04:45.993
Get up here!
Clarence, you know what?

04:46.081 --> 04:47.795
Unless this involves
a dimensional key,

04:47.883 --> 04:49.327
- I'm not...
- I've located a dimensional key.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.482
Oh, look at that.
Alright. I'll be right there.

04:52.181 --> 04:56.303
Before we start,
I want to apologize for my behavior.

04:56.678 --> 05:00.865
You see, it's been me,
Fox, and Ash for so long,

05:00.953 --> 05:04.803
but I really am happy
that you're all... here.

05:04.891 --> 05:07.289
What is this?
Is this whipped cream? Good news.

05:07.377 --> 05:10.959
An associate of mine
by the name of Horace Vercox

05:11.047 --> 05:13.894
has contacted me concerning
a rare artifact

05:13.989 --> 05:17.491
he believes might be
a dimensional key.

05:17.663 --> 05:19.062
I've arranged a little
meet with him

05:19.149 --> 05:20.641
on the Darga Space Port.

05:20.785 --> 05:23.383
Star Travel calls
Darga Space Port

05:23.471 --> 05:25.317
a "four-star family
space station

05:25.405 --> 05:28.701
filled with charming shops,
cafés, and free jazz

05:28.789 --> 05:31.813
- on Tuesdays between 11:00 and 11:05."
- Chookity?

05:31.900 --> 05:34.858
You say you want to pack a bag
and bro out for the day?

05:34.946 --> 05:37.969
- Chookity chook!
- Alright. Boys night out.

05:38.057 --> 05:39.983
Horace will be
at the Drilling Factory

05:40.071 --> 05:41.547
in District 69.

05:41.634 --> 05:44.141
Ah, yes, of course.
A mining camp.

05:44.229 --> 05:46.000
Man, that key must've
been buried deep.

05:46.088 --> 05:47.754
Alright, never thought
I would say this,

05:47.842 --> 05:51.055
but, Clarence...
thank you.

05:51.914 --> 05:52.937
- Oh!
- Uh!

05:53.025 --> 05:54.039
Gaww!

05:54.127 --> 05:56.076
How 'bout you don't
swallow my hand?

05:56.164 --> 05:58.390
AVA, lock in course
to Darga Space Port.

05:58.510 --> 05:59.741
Spooling engines.

05:59.829 --> 06:00.967
Lightfold!

06:05.427 --> 06:07.895
You've arrived
at Darga Space Port,

06:08.098 --> 06:11.446
where all things are possible.

06:11.836 --> 06:14.266
Oh, wow! Guns!
Okay.

06:14.353 --> 06:15.358
It's 11:02.

06:15.446 --> 06:17.725
If we hurry, we can
still catch some free jazz.

06:17.813 --> 06:19.272
11:02.01.

06:19.360 --> 06:21.998
11:02.02.
11:02...

06:22.086 --> 06:24.024
Don't wait up for us
knuckleheads.

06:24.141 --> 06:25.928
Due to the heartiness
of the partying,

06:26.016 --> 06:27.344
we may be home late.

06:27.432 --> 06:28.770
Clarence, you coming
to the Drilling Factory?

06:28.857 --> 06:31.601
No, I have two tickets to see
my favorite singer,

06:31.689 --> 06:33.094
Venus Marston.

06:33.319 --> 06:37.055
She has eight mouths but sings
with her dried-out eyes.

06:37.143 --> 06:39.797
Well, that's a big bag of suck.
I'm gonna skip that.

06:39.885 --> 06:42.072
I'd love to hear those
dried-out eyes sing!

06:42.160 --> 06:44.039
Oh, well,
lucky for you,

06:44.134 --> 06:46.719
I have an extra ticket
waiting at will-call.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.344
Why don't you
grab them for us?

06:48.432 --> 06:52.305
Father-son opera night?
That's every little boy's dream!

06:53.250 --> 06:57.495
Yes! Yes! Yeah!

07:04.304 --> 07:06.633
Clarence,
why are you deactivating

07:06.721 --> 07:08.461
my security protocol?

07:08.708 --> 07:10.742
What are you doing
with the dimensional keys?

07:10.891 --> 07:13.282
Sorry, sweetie,
but none of it's your business.

07:13.370 --> 07:16.188
Clarence, I have been tasked
with guarding the keys.

07:16.276 --> 07:17.348
I will not allow...

07:17.436 --> 07:21.000
Go to sleep,
my electronic princess.

07:23.191 --> 07:26.418
The retail opportunities
are spectacular.

07:26.653 --> 07:27.705
Chookity, pok, pok.

07:27.824 --> 07:29.039
I know, right?

07:29.127 --> 07:31.453
That hat would turn me
into a Super Beast.

07:31.541 --> 07:33.953
It would almost be unfair
to the ladies.

07:34.257 --> 07:35.953
10,000 dropnoids?

07:36.223 --> 07:37.774
Where am I going
to get my hands

07:37.862 --> 07:39.344
on that amount
of scratch?

07:39.633 --> 07:41.946
Chookity? "Battle Royale.

07:42.034 --> 07:46.063
Last bot standing wins
10,000 dropnoids"?

07:46.151 --> 07:48.108
What an eerily
convenient development.

07:48.196 --> 07:51.087
- Pok, pok, pok, pok!
- It looks like it might be dangerous.

07:51.348 --> 07:55.196
Then again, this bod
was built to rumble.

07:56.391 --> 07:59.219
Welcome to the battle
of the century!

07:59.664 --> 08:03.892
Introducing Rangor,
Bisector of Souls...

08:04.167 --> 08:07.842
Bangadron,
Humbler of Demons...

08:08.164 --> 08:12.196
Flarsgrow,
Emperor of Madness...

08:12.491 --> 08:17.172
and the... the paper
here says "H.U.E."

08:18.588 --> 08:20.578
Pok. Do you mean that, Mooncake?

08:20.666 --> 08:22.823
- You think I'm capable?
- Chookity.

08:23.007 --> 08:26.203
That's the nicest thing anyone
has ever said to me.

08:26.671 --> 08:28.897
Let the battle begin!

08:28.985 --> 08:31.421
Alright, everyone,
get ready for H.U.E.,

08:31.509 --> 08:33.859
bringer of
the little baton.

08:34.523 --> 08:36.335
There.
Take that.

08:39.244 --> 08:41.107
You want some more?

08:44.614 --> 08:47.022
Hmm.
I'll take that as a no.

08:49.656 --> 08:50.639
Chookity!

08:50.727 --> 08:53.056
I am invincible.

08:53.172 --> 08:56.873
Whoa!
I really am a god.

09:01.006 --> 09:02.240
- Pop Pop?
- Aah!

09:04.779 --> 09:05.897
Why are you here?

09:05.985 --> 09:07.577
You're... You're supposed
to be at the concert

09:07.664 --> 09:08.798
I completely made up.

09:08.886 --> 09:11.647
Why would you lie
about father-son opera night?

09:11.735 --> 09:14.279
All of you have clearly
gone on without me.

09:14.367 --> 09:17.873
You have a new family now.
Well, I've also moved on.

09:17.961 --> 09:20.928
I've found someone who loves me
as much as I do her.

09:21.016 --> 09:23.345
But Gary needs those keys
to save Quinn.

09:23.433 --> 09:25.115
They're my keys.
It's my ship.

09:25.218 --> 09:27.389
All of this
belongs to me!

09:28.408 --> 09:29.779
Drop the keys.

09:40.901 --> 09:41.698
Clarence.

09:41.786 --> 09:43.402
I'm on my way.

09:50.294 --> 09:52.996
This is not
a drilling factory.

09:53.084 --> 09:55.414
Ooh! That lady's shirt
accidentally fell off.

09:55.502 --> 09:57.179
Excuse me, miss?
You dropped your shirt.

09:57.267 --> 09:58.291
KVN!
Please, no.

09:58.379 --> 10:00.480
Why is that guy shoving
his butt into the...

10:00.568 --> 10:02.172
Okay, we're gonna wait
over here, then.

10:04.190 --> 10:06.899
We need to turn
the power back on.

10:09.849 --> 10:11.048
You can do this.

10:11.136 --> 10:14.308
You can do this.
Just count it down.

10:14.647 --> 10:16.003
1!

10:16.465 --> 10:17.897
2!

10:18.110 --> 10:21.230
31!

10:21.519 --> 10:22.839
I...

10:22.927 --> 10:24.463
lost...

10:24.551 --> 10:25.741
count!

10:25.990 --> 10:27.905
A!

10:27.993 --> 10:30.011
B!

10:32.844 --> 10:34.008
D!

10:34.638 --> 10:36.588
Ship's power
has been restored.

10:36.809 --> 10:39.386
Fox, you are severely injured.

10:39.474 --> 10:42.736
Oh, I'm so glad I powered you up
to tell me that!

10:42.824 --> 10:44.582
Patch me through
to Ashy!

10:45.826 --> 10:47.199
- Ashy?
- Fox?

10:47.287 --> 10:50.318
It's Dad!
He stole the dimensional keys!

10:50.622 --> 10:52.082
- Fox!
- I'm starting to think

10:52.170 --> 10:54.597
there isn't a Horace Vercox
here after all!

10:54.685 --> 10:55.996
My brother needs me.

10:56.351 --> 10:57.707
Ash, no!

10:57.893 --> 10:59.269
KVN, go with Ash.

10:59.464 --> 11:02.073
Got it. Bye!
Thank you!

11:04.988 --> 11:08.019
I am the deathbringer,
Robot of Chaos.

11:08.107 --> 11:11.092
And I'm here for my money
if you don't mind, please.

11:11.232 --> 11:13.183
Congratulations!

11:13.271 --> 11:15.050
Thing is,
that's a lot of money,

11:15.138 --> 11:18.011
so, uh, we keep it
in an a very safe place.

11:18.165 --> 11:21.496
It's in the tallest building
on the space port.

11:21.584 --> 11:23.056
Another unforeseen
wrinkle?

11:23.159 --> 11:25.762
Hmm, this is turning into
quite the boys' night out.

11:29.112 --> 11:30.636
Ooh!
Ooh, whee.

11:30.724 --> 11:33.128
That's the tallest building
I've ever seen.

11:33.309 --> 11:35.497
It's the height
of inconvenience.

11:35.585 --> 11:37.386
- Hmm.
- Chookity.

11:40.488 --> 11:43.496
Sorry about the door.
I couldn't find a handle.

11:43.768 --> 11:46.152
Zixneeyak!
How did you find us?

11:46.240 --> 11:47.511
Did you really think
you could

11:47.599 --> 11:49.246
steal our loot
and get away with it?!

11:49.334 --> 11:52.425
Well, we've got a killer bot
who's gonna mess you up!

11:52.513 --> 11:54.359
Actually, I'm just here
for my money.

11:54.447 --> 11:55.602
Alright, H.U.E.!

11:55.737 --> 11:58.308
- Mess 'em up!
- What?

11:58.610 --> 12:00.472
Sure hope this
is the money.

12:00.605 --> 12:02.886
- Let's bounce.
- Chookity!

12:05.449 --> 12:06.979
- Freeze!
- The cops?

12:07.067 --> 12:09.339
Oh, no, oh, no,
oh, no, oh, no.

12:09.427 --> 12:11.050
- Chookity.
- Excellent idea.

12:11.138 --> 12:13.709
I think I will give
my legs a stretch.

12:13.797 --> 12:15.386
Stretching.

12:15.929 --> 12:17.457
Stretching.

12:17.816 --> 12:19.378
Stretching.

12:19.579 --> 12:22.066
Stretching.

12:23.081 --> 12:24.151
Ooh.

12:24.239 --> 12:27.550
Hello, officers
and guns in my face.

12:29.197 --> 12:31.285
There he is.
Give us the keys!

12:31.373 --> 12:32.632
You're a snake!

12:32.720 --> 12:34.191
And a rat.

12:35.912 --> 12:38.587
Oh, oh!
He really is a snake rat!

12:38.675 --> 12:40.105
You seem surprised.

12:40.193 --> 12:43.903
I've been wearing a skin suit
the whole time.

12:43.991 --> 12:45.181
What a twist!

12:45.269 --> 12:47.909
So long, suckers.

12:49.371 --> 12:50.378
M'lady?

12:50.466 --> 12:51.707
Ow! Ooh!

12:51.795 --> 12:52.613
Why did you punch me?

12:52.701 --> 12:53.957
Nightfall,
what the hell?

12:54.045 --> 12:55.574
You just laid this
poor guy out.

12:55.662 --> 12:57.363
- Does it sting?
- Ooh! That really stings.

12:57.451 --> 12:58.855
- Nightfall, it stings.
- Oh, my gosh.

12:58.942 --> 13:00.089
Does anyone have any ice?

13:00.177 --> 13:02.092
Or like a bag of
frozen bean snaps?

13:02.180 --> 13:03.371
Both of you get on!

13:03.789 --> 13:05.792
No!
Don't take my Chucky.

13:05.880 --> 13:07.842
Well, hey, we're gonna return
Chucky to you, sir!

13:07.930 --> 13:09.800
You have
my solemn word!

13:09.888 --> 13:11.270
We're definitely gonna
forget to return him.

13:11.357 --> 13:13.738
No, no, no, no.
Not this time, Little Cato.

13:13.826 --> 13:14.988
Not this time.

13:15.076 --> 13:17.394
AVA, scan the city
for the strongest power source.

13:17.482 --> 13:18.816
Scanning...

13:18.904 --> 13:20.824
I've detected Clarence
in a hover car...

13:20.968 --> 13:23.628
3 kilometers west
and moving fast.

13:24.074 --> 13:25.736
Fox! Aah!

13:27.435 --> 13:29.212
Hold on.
Come on, KVN.

13:29.300 --> 13:32.308
This is your moment
to make it about you!

13:35.352 --> 13:38.337
Yes, you're doing it!
We are at maximum KVN!

13:43.902 --> 13:47.230
Fox's mechanical-life-support
systems are shorting out.

13:47.318 --> 13:50.119
I don't have the materials
needed to save it.

13:50.207 --> 13:51.984
I knew Clarence was
a deceitful,

13:52.072 --> 13:56.423
cowardly, untrustworthy con,
but he was our dad.

13:56.776 --> 13:58.494
I never thought
he'd con us.

13:58.582 --> 13:59.842
Aw, hey.

14:01.175 --> 14:02.384
Aw.

14:18.125 --> 14:21.127
Hey, wasn't that when
they tried to kill...

14:28.749 --> 14:30.284
What kind of material
do you need?

14:30.441 --> 14:31.459
Tritanium.

14:31.632 --> 14:34.134
KVN knows what
he must do.

14:34.524 --> 14:36.506
Aah!
What are you doing?

14:36.594 --> 14:37.999
Don't look at me!

14:38.087 --> 14:40.140
Is this what those women
were doing to you earlier?

14:40.228 --> 14:44.158
No. Well, well, yes,
but not for this purpose.

14:44.283 --> 14:46.527
What is that? That is my falanger.

14:46.614 --> 14:47.804
It's made out
of tritanium,

14:47.892 --> 14:49.462
and it keeps me
from going insane.

14:49.550 --> 14:52.564
But you're a deep-space
insanity-avoidance companion.

14:52.652 --> 14:53.712
Don't you need that?

14:53.800 --> 14:56.955
Probably, but, you know,
I want Fox to live.

14:57.043 --> 14:58.603
I like him.

15:03.351 --> 15:06.650
Ash, Fox's vitals
have stabilized.

15:08.107 --> 15:12.072
KVN, I just want to say,
thank you for this...

15:12.676 --> 15:13.901
for everything.

15:16.379 --> 15:18.572
Insanity levels reaching
dangerous levels.

15:18.660 --> 15:19.962
You're a hero.

15:20.050 --> 15:21.744
Help me!
Help me!

15:21.832 --> 15:25.577
Yum, yum, yum, yum!

15:26.041 --> 15:28.306
I see him,
that little snake rat!

15:28.394 --> 15:30.033
I'll get closer,
and you two jump.

15:30.121 --> 15:31.864
Are you crazy?!
I'm not jumping!

15:31.952 --> 15:34.220
Plus what's gonna happen
to Chucky at the end of this?

15:34.308 --> 15:36.502
We all knew going in
the Chucky ride would end...

15:36.689 --> 15:39.002
- Even you.
- I'm so sorry, Chucky!

15:39.298 --> 15:41.092
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

15:41.180 --> 15:42.784
Aah!
Chucky!

15:44.918 --> 15:46.767
Clarence!
Hand over the keys!

15:46.855 --> 15:48.425
- Never.
- Aah!

15:48.660 --> 15:49.816
What?

15:50.184 --> 15:51.433
Ha ha! Ohh!

15:51.537 --> 15:53.489
How are you so agile
at your age?

15:53.577 --> 15:55.251
And don't say
sex stuff.

15:55.354 --> 15:57.291
Sex stuff!

15:57.379 --> 15:59.087
Gary! Jump!

16:01.117 --> 16:02.410
Gary, he's on the train.

16:02.514 --> 16:04.123
I can see that!

16:06.106 --> 16:09.842
Clarence! Come on.
Why are you doing this?

16:09.930 --> 16:12.314
I wanted someone
to love me, too!

16:12.461 --> 16:14.790
- Is that so hard to believe?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

16:14.886 --> 16:16.112
I'm actually really surprised
about that,

16:16.199 --> 16:17.846
but I'm also surprised
you think you can escape

16:17.933 --> 16:19.244
when we have you
cornered.

16:19.332 --> 16:21.259
Now, Little Cato!

16:21.491 --> 16:24.080
How little
you know about me!

16:24.175 --> 16:26.056
Aah! How many skins
are you wearing?

16:26.144 --> 16:27.368
Not enough!

16:27.879 --> 16:29.173
Well, ta-ta!

16:29.260 --> 16:31.278
No. No!

16:36.171 --> 16:38.124
Almost forgot.

16:38.212 --> 16:39.305
Ooh!

16:39.557 --> 16:41.235
Much better.

16:41.850 --> 16:43.799
Guess who?

16:44.042 --> 16:45.188
Were you followed?

16:45.276 --> 16:47.148
For a bit,
but I shook them.

16:47.236 --> 16:48.607
Do you have
the dimensional keys?

16:48.695 --> 16:50.194
Yes, my love.

16:52.734 --> 16:53.778
One more left.

16:53.866 --> 16:55.168
Do you know where it is?

16:55.256 --> 16:57.654
- The planet Rugaro.
- You did well.

16:57.742 --> 16:59.208
I did it for you.

16:59.296 --> 17:01.616
Now let's talk about
all the times ahead

17:01.704 --> 17:02.915
we have together.

17:03.431 --> 17:05.538
You're not
serious, are you?

17:06.479 --> 17:08.387
You and I,
we're the same...

17:08.474 --> 17:10.435
Liars, cheaters,
thieves,

17:10.523 --> 17:12.507
hedonists who live
for nothing more

17:12.601 --> 17:14.861
than our own
selfish pleasure!

17:14.949 --> 17:17.898
Don't make me laugh.
We're nothing alike.

17:17.987 --> 17:21.335
You're a disgusting
little toad.

17:21.440 --> 17:23.114
I'll never be yours.

17:23.202 --> 17:24.663
- Got it?
- Wait.

17:24.751 --> 17:26.493
No, no, no, no.
Don't go.

17:26.615 --> 17:30.359
I abandoned everything I have
in the world for you.

17:30.447 --> 17:32.993
You... You can't leave me
with nothing!

17:33.304 --> 17:35.012
Aw, yeah, but, you see,

17:35.100 --> 17:36.577
you left yourself
with nothing.

17:36.665 --> 17:38.097
Ta-ta.

17:45.021 --> 17:46.630
No, no, no, no, no!

17:46.718 --> 17:48.564
Who did you give
the keys to?

17:48.652 --> 17:49.911
Sheryl.

17:49.999 --> 17:51.323
My mom?

17:51.411 --> 17:52.589
What did she want
with them?

17:52.684 --> 17:55.807
Oh, I don't know.
But...

17:55.918 --> 17:57.950
But I can you
where she's going.

17:58.038 --> 18:01.299
Where?! The planet Rugaro on
the edge of the Dark Zone.

18:01.386 --> 18:02.558
Alright. Let's go.

18:02.646 --> 18:05.128
Let me come
with you, please!

18:06.123 --> 18:08.141
Why would
I ever let you?

18:08.393 --> 18:11.206
You lied to us.
You almost killed Fox.

18:11.293 --> 18:12.310
I did?

18:12.397 --> 18:14.587
Well, that wasn't
my intention.

18:14.675 --> 18:16.176
Things will be different.

18:16.264 --> 18:17.833
I told you where
she's going.

18:17.964 --> 18:21.071
I betrayed her
for you.

18:21.159 --> 18:23.320
Take me with you!

18:23.408 --> 18:25.415
Please!

18:25.531 --> 18:26.583
Nah.

18:26.866 --> 18:28.505
Too little, too late.

18:35.908 --> 18:37.196
Here, officer.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.337
I believe
you're looking for this.

18:39.595 --> 18:41.112
10,000 dropnoids?

18:41.200 --> 18:43.494
This is the stolen loot
from the Xerdoninex robbery!

18:43.582 --> 18:44.869
Wait.
I can explain.

18:44.957 --> 18:48.073
It took extreme bravery
to recover these funds.

18:48.161 --> 18:49.909
We've been after them
for a long time.

18:50.017 --> 18:51.479
I... Uh, wh-what?

18:51.567 --> 18:53.143
- You're heroes!
- Chookity pok!

18:53.231 --> 18:55.664
We're on a real tear tonight,
Mooncake.

18:55.752 --> 18:57.932
It is my extreme privilege

18:58.020 --> 19:01.221
to award you
our planet's highest honor.

19:01.309 --> 19:02.320
Chookity!

19:02.413 --> 19:03.638
Mm.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.181
Look, Mooncake.

19:08.276 --> 19:09.743
That's us.
Chookity!

19:09.831 --> 19:13.044
And here's your reward,
50,000 dropnoids?

19:13.154 --> 19:16.201
The reward for returning
10,000 dropnoids

19:16.289 --> 19:18.326
is 50,000 dropnoids?

19:18.414 --> 19:22.007
Ha! Just another reason
why our economy's in shambles.

19:22.445 --> 19:24.115
Hey, kid.
Almost forgot.

19:24.289 --> 19:27.451
Try this on for size.
It's part of the reward.

19:27.622 --> 19:30.544
Alright!
This is why we play the game.

19:30.632 --> 19:31.685
Chookity!

19:45.140 --> 19:47.169
I'm barely holding on.

19:47.635 --> 19:50.102
We lost the keys,
all of them.

19:50.704 --> 19:52.089
I failed Quinn.

19:52.358 --> 19:55.480
This must be what KVN feels like
all the time.

19:55.568 --> 19:57.034
We got hit hard,

19:57.283 --> 19:59.128
but we get back up.

20:01.966 --> 20:03.847
Sweet lid, tiger.

20:03.935 --> 20:05.953
Ooh! It's working.

20:06.041 --> 20:07.214
Leave it on.

20:07.302 --> 20:08.907
We all need a win.

20:08.995 --> 20:10.426
- This is not just for Quinn.
- Yum, yum, yum, yum!

20:10.513 --> 20:11.922
- Yum, yum, yum, yum!
- It's for Fox.

20:12.009 --> 20:13.337
It's for all of us.

20:13.455 --> 20:15.449
- And if we fail?
- We won't.

20:15.657 --> 20:17.814
And we're getting those
dimensional keys...

20:18.009 --> 20:19.377
All of them.

20:27.526 --> 20:29.626
Oh, I knew we forgot
something.

20:48.810 --> 20:50.861
How many keys remain?

20:50.949 --> 20:52.041
One.

20:52.166 --> 20:53.970
When can I see
my husband?

20:54.734 --> 20:57.869
When your task is
DONE.
