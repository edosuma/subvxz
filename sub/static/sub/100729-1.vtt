00:54.930 --> 00:57.046
[Man on TV] Palmer, Alaska
has luxury homes

00:57.140 --> 00:59.096
- with million-dollar views.
- [Man chuckling]

00:59.184 --> 01:00.784
[Man on TV] Cole and Amanda
have saved up

01:00.852 --> 01:03.264
and are ready to spend
the big bucks.

01:03.355 --> 01:07.064
This log house has surprises
around every turn.

01:08.110 --> 01:09.600
[Man 2 on TV] Now, that's nice.

01:10.112 --> 01:11.881
- Wow!
- [Male narrator] I've always suspected

01:11.905 --> 01:15.693
that I didn't want the desirable things
in life as much as I should.

01:15.784 --> 01:20.073
Women, cars, houses, movies, bands.

01:20.163 --> 01:23.701
These things were how people chiseled out
a tidy philosophy of life.

01:23.792 --> 01:26.187
- [Iman on TV] This can't be for real.
- Lwoman on TV] It's really serene.

01:26.211 --> 01:28.293
[Narrator]
I never needed a philosophy of life.

01:28.380 --> 01:29.649
[Man on TV] And one more thing.
This is awesome.

01:29.673 --> 01:31.317
[Narrator]
It's only people who wanted things,

01:31.341 --> 01:33.548
felt guilty about getting
things and frustrated

01:33.635 --> 01:36.172
about not getting things
that needed a philosophy.

01:36.263 --> 01:37.615
[Woman on TV] It might be my favorite
part of the house.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.470
[Man on TV]
The garage of Cole's dreams,

01:39.558 --> 01:44.143
a party shower and a sunroom.
What will it all cost?

01:44.229 --> 01:45.957
[Narrator]
I was just as pleased to get drunk

01:45.981 --> 01:48.723
or drink a bunch and not get drunk.

01:48.817 --> 01:50.169
[Cole]
The main thing is the grass for me.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.233
- [There's just so much of it.
- Lwoman on TV] Yeah.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.402
- [Knocking on door]
- Hmm?

02:15.302 --> 02:17.509
[Lock clicking]

02:29.358 --> 02:33.271
[Grunting] [Groaning]

02:34.154 --> 02:35.234
Give me your weapon.

02:36.073 --> 02:37.609
I don't got one. [Groans]

02:37.699 --> 02:40.031
Someone that fights like you
should have a weapon.

02:40.577 --> 02:43.660
Trespassin' is a lot different
than armed robbery, smart guy.

02:43.747 --> 02:45.783
Mm-hmm.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.866
- You talk too much.
- [Man mumbling]

02:49.419 --> 02:50.419
[Knocking on door]

02:50.671 --> 02:52.502
[Colin]
Kyle, you here? It's Colin.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.090
Tell me you still got it, man.

02:58.804 --> 02:59.839
Yes!

03:00.722 --> 03:05.091
Ooh! That's what I'm talking about.
Hey, that's what I'm talking about.

03:06.019 --> 03:09.011
[Exhales]
You may wanna step out for a while.

03:09.773 --> 03:10.853
Why's that?

03:11.733 --> 03:13.815
Well, there's a gentleman may stop by.

03:13.902 --> 03:16.735
If so, I got to shoot him.

03:18.407 --> 03:20.568
Colin, you one crazy son of a bitch.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.740
[Chuckles]

03:24.121 --> 03:27.830
[TV audience cheering]

03:29.793 --> 03:31.124
I got a guy in my closet.

03:32.546 --> 03:35.128
I don't know if it's the same
one you're thinking of.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.581
- Curly headed?
- Yeah, that's the one.

03:39.010 --> 03:40.250
And he's alive?

03:40.929 --> 03:42.044
So far.

03:43.557 --> 03:44.592
Pack your shit.

03:46.268 --> 03:48.554
- Did I just get promoted?
- [Colin] Yep.

03:49.271 --> 03:51.057
You goin' to Arkansas.

03:57.779 --> 03:59.179
[Kyle narrating] I'm a drug dealer.

04:03.827 --> 04:07.365
I'm near the bottom rung of an outfit
run by a man named frog.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.036
A man I've never met before.

04:12.544 --> 04:14.876
To be honest,
I'm not sure he even exists.

04:17.382 --> 04:20.418
What a lot of people don't know
about organized crime in the south

04:20.510 --> 04:22.421
is that it's not that organized.

04:23.096 --> 04:26.133
The term Dixie mafia
has always been too generous,

04:26.224 --> 04:27.839
implied too grand a scale.

04:30.312 --> 04:33.930
There's a handful of big-time operators
that run everything regionally, but...

04:34.483 --> 04:38.067
It's nothing like the Italians
or the Mexicans, no families.

04:38.862 --> 04:41.820
Just a loose affiliation
of deadbeats and scumbags.

04:43.408 --> 04:44.568
No code of honor.

04:46.119 --> 04:47.859
No philosophy of life.

04:53.251 --> 04:56.743
It's mostly boring solitary work,
but that suits me just fine.

04:59.883 --> 05:01.839
Relying on other people
is the fastest way

05:01.927 --> 05:03.667
fo end up dead in this business.

05:48.473 --> 05:49.473
[Car door shuts]

05:49.558 --> 05:51.594
You Kyle? You swin?

05:51.768 --> 05:54.225
Welcome aboard.
I'll be your co-pilot this evening.

05:54.813 --> 05:57.350
Colin didn't mention I'd be
captaining a highway barge.

05:57.440 --> 06:00.147
Yeah, well, you're moving wholesale now,
the big leagues.

06:02.571 --> 06:03.777
[Kyle] What's with the cones?

06:04.155 --> 06:06.692
I thought the randomness
of it might throw off a cop.

06:09.244 --> 06:10.654
Well, I guess that's smart.

06:11.663 --> 06:15.952
- I'm somethin' of a criminal mastermind.
- Oh, you're one of those witty people?

06:16.251 --> 06:17.457
I've been called worse.

06:18.962 --> 06:21.203
You kinda remind me of a game show host.

06:23.341 --> 06:24.341
You know what, Kyle?

06:24.426 --> 06:27.338
It strikes me that if you wanna be
the strong silent type,

06:27.429 --> 06:30.171
you really gotta keep yourself
from commenting on every little thing.

06:31.141 --> 06:32.426
It won't be right away,

06:32.517 --> 06:34.678
but at some point soon
I'm gonna knock you on your ass.

06:34.811 --> 06:35.811
[Swin chuckles]

06:35.896 --> 06:37.932
I suggest you keep
the bullshit to a minimum.

06:38.023 --> 06:39.138
Look at you.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.857
No, you act tough now,
but we'll be friends.

06:42.944 --> 06:44.589
Everybody who meets me
wants to be my friend.

06:44.613 --> 06:46.649
Yeah, I find that hard to believe.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.071
I mean, what's not to like?

06:48.867 --> 06:50.823
What kinda name is swin anyway?

06:51.119 --> 06:53.485
Your mother's. Get in.

07:02.172 --> 07:05.164
If we go 83 the rest of the way
we won't be late.

07:07.260 --> 07:10.002
Getting pulled over with drugs
makes you really late.

07:11.640 --> 07:12.971
There I go learnin' again.

07:13.391 --> 07:14.972
You don't get this smart on accident.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.021
That's nice to see.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.273
[Scoffs]

07:29.282 --> 07:31.568
- You're sad.
- No.

07:32.410 --> 07:34.138
It's just most women
don't breastfeed anymore,

07:34.162 --> 07:35.777
which is a shame, you know?

07:35.872 --> 07:38.033
'Cause breastfed babies
get fewer syndromes.

07:38.124 --> 07:39.580
I was a formula baby.

07:39.668 --> 07:42.831
Your big ass I'm guessin" had
a mouthful of the real deal.

07:43.380 --> 07:46.122
- No idea.
- [Swin] Oh, I bet ya did.

07:46.216 --> 07:48.673
Bet you had a titty
in your mouth from day one.

07:48.760 --> 07:50.546
Let's call your mother and ask.

07:51.930 --> 07:53.090
She's dead.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.353
I wouldn't care if all my sisters died.

08:03.525 --> 08:06.016
- You're fuckin' stupid.
- [Laughs]

08:06.111 --> 08:08.978
- [Tarp rustling]
- Ah, shit.

08:09.072 --> 08:10.437
God damn it.

08:12.409 --> 08:15.025
Really? Duct tape, MacGyver?

08:15.120 --> 08:16.405
You see any rope in there?

08:17.038 --> 08:19.950
I'm improvising 'cause your
damn cover job was so shoddy.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.749
[Swin] Shit. [Kyle] Fuck.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.544
Uh, let me do the talkin'.

08:27.465 --> 08:29.922
Hey, now.
I'm Mike, how's your day going?

08:30.010 --> 08:31.671
Uh, first aid kit's in the console.

08:32.345 --> 08:35.633
Pat bright, park ranger.
You boys heading far?

08:35.724 --> 08:36.724
Corpus christi.

08:37.808 --> 08:41.142
[Pat]
I noticed your rig needs some help.

08:41.229 --> 08:44.437
[Swin laughing] Well, not sure
I agree with that 100 percent,

08:44.524 --> 08:47.106
but I guess everything
gives out in time, doesn't it?

08:47.193 --> 08:48.193
If you're patient.

08:48.653 --> 08:51.816
You gotta get more rope,
go corner to corner.

08:51.906 --> 08:55.569
Yeah, I know it.
Uh, we were just in a rush this morning.

08:55.702 --> 08:58.284
Still are. “What's the haul?

08:59.998 --> 09:00.998
Faucets.

09:01.332 --> 09:04.415
Yep, some, uh, computer tycoon, you know?

09:04.502 --> 09:06.242
Used to be oil, now it's computers.

09:08.339 --> 09:11.331
There are no faucets in corpus?

09:14.262 --> 09:16.127
[Chuckles] That's what I said,

09:16.222 --> 09:18.804
but he said he's gotta have that
adobe-marble core.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.975
[Pat] Mm-hmm, well let me take
a look how you got this stacked.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.769
I'm a safety expert in this state.

09:24.856 --> 09:26.687
I appreciate...
I appreciate it, sir,

09:26.775 --> 09:28.294
but the thing is,
we really gotta haul ass.

09:28.318 --> 09:30.296
- We're already pretty far.
- Hey, enough questions.

09:30.320 --> 09:31.400
Fuck.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.024
What's the cones for?

09:43.374 --> 09:49.665
You boys are carrying a load of faucets,
stuffed with bags of powder and plug.

09:49.756 --> 09:50.916
You left from little rock,

09:51.007 --> 09:53.874
and you got a map of each state
in your glove box.

09:54.761 --> 09:57.423
I'm with frog.
I've been ordered to intervene.

09:58.473 --> 10:01.340
So, you boys not gonna have
a lot of choice

10:01.434 --> 10:03.049
about your immediate futures.

10:03.770 --> 10:06.637
You gonna work under me
at the state park.

10:06.731 --> 10:10.849
Frog's got a whole new loop of clients
and I'm running those deals,

10:11.027 --> 10:13.484
so try not to look like deer
in the headlights.

10:14.155 --> 10:17.363
Try to look angry or bored or something.

10:18.493 --> 10:22.486
- So you know frog, personally?
- I've known frogman for years.

10:22.580 --> 10:25.492
Ever since a truck of his
got lost in my park.

10:27.210 --> 10:29.417
You boys gonna ride with me.

10:31.923 --> 10:33.459
What about the flatbed?

10:33.716 --> 10:36.128
[Pat]
Uh, Colin here will take it the rest away.

10:36.469 --> 10:39.051
[Colin chuckles]
What's up, Kyle?

10:41.391 --> 10:42.972
I don't think you gonna need that.

10:47.230 --> 10:48.686
I about blew you away.

10:50.024 --> 10:54.142
- You trying to convince someone?
- No.

10:54.237 --> 10:55.352
No, I hate guns.

10:56.573 --> 10:59.213
They say it ain't smart to fuck around
with someone you don't know.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.275
Your name is Kyle ribb.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.112
You never killed a man,
and your name is swin horn.

11:05.206 --> 11:06.491
You never killed a man.

11:08.251 --> 11:09.741
You're dependable.

11:12.046 --> 11:13.411
You're a project.

11:17.427 --> 11:18.633
[Car door closes]

11:21.264 --> 11:25.098
[Pat] So, here's how this
is all gonna shake out.

11:25.185 --> 11:28.643
You two boys get to live
in trailers on the park grounds.

11:29.022 --> 11:32.059
Don't worry, I'm not playing favorites.

11:32.567 --> 11:33.898
They're identical.

11:34.903 --> 11:38.316
You'll have nine to five covers
as park peons.

11:38.406 --> 11:42.399
Maintainin' the grounds,
directin' lost suvs.

11:42.493 --> 11:44.680
You are here, you're gonna make a right
and a left all the way to the end.

11:44.704 --> 11:48.196
[Pat] Your cover names are
Robert Suarez and ed mollar.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.331
These are my rules.

11:50.418 --> 11:53.626
I'm only gonna say 'em once,
so listen the fuck up.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.045
I am the boss.

11:56.174 --> 12:00.463
You may never refuse an order
and you may never quit.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.043
If you decide to run off,

12:02.138 --> 12:04.720
I will hunt you down
and I will kill you,

12:04.807 --> 12:07.469
no matter how much
I've grown to like you.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.801
Do not socialize with the locals.

12:09.979 --> 12:12.015
Do not bring girls around.

12:12.106 --> 12:14.438
Do not draw attention to yourself.

12:15.068 --> 12:18.902
In time you two might take over
the operation,

12:18.988 --> 12:22.321
cutting me in for a humble percentage.

12:22.408 --> 12:27.653
Why, just think.
One day this could all be yours.

12:34.128 --> 12:35.243
[Exhales]

12:35.755 --> 12:37.916
- [Swin pants]
- [Vacuum whirring]

12:38.174 --> 12:39.174
[Swin] Where's the boss?

12:40.551 --> 12:41.882
Vacuumin' his corvette.

12:42.887 --> 12:45.378
Goin' on two hours.
He's obsessed with it.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.338
More of a German car guy myself.

12:48.059 --> 12:50.300
You think there's any chance
bright is frog?

12:50.395 --> 12:51.395
Ero.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.311
It's fresh thinkin' though.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.226
Where do you think frog lives,
on a ranch somewhere?

12:56.359 --> 12:59.271
I think that we will have
to work at this company

12:59.404 --> 13:00.923
for a long time
before we ever found out

13:00.947 --> 13:02.357
anything true about the frogman.

13:02.657 --> 13:04.739
I heard he has a pool
shaped like a Lily pad.

13:04.826 --> 13:06.236
Yep, there you go.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.909
For a long time it's just
gonna be shit like that.

13:08.997 --> 13:10.578
Inconsequential falsehoods.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.787
[Pat] Sleep well? All nested in?

13:15.712 --> 13:18.920
Would either of you boys
like to call me sir?

13:19.007 --> 13:20.417
You can if you want.

13:21.050 --> 13:22.415
I won't think it's corny.

13:26.014 --> 13:28.926
We're gonna go traffic drugs
across state lines, sir!

13:44.198 --> 13:45.483
[Swin] You see that?

13:46.242 --> 13:48.608
Place like that's where
my sisters are gonna end up.

13:48.745 --> 13:51.111
How many of those
you got anyway, like, ten?

13:51.205 --> 13:52.820
They don't have their real father.

13:52.915 --> 13:54.621
Their stepdad is overly strict.

13:54.709 --> 13:57.121
He ran me off,
so I'm not there to protect 'em.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.410
Sounds like a stripper recipe to me.

14:00.381 --> 14:01.587
Yeah.

14:02.508 --> 14:03.748
Well, you never can tell.

14:04.552 --> 14:06.588
One of 'em's already named cinnamon.

14:17.106 --> 14:19.347
[Woman over pa]
I need a price check on register five.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.148
Price check on register five.

Do you happen to know
where the radishes are?

14:32.538 --> 14:34.199
I don't know, with the vegetables.

14:34.499 --> 14:37.582
- That's an educated guess.

I'll be in the area.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.303
Yeah, I'm a freelance government auditor.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.516
Let's get this courtship underway.

15:00.525 --> 15:03.141
- I'm on shift tonight.
- What about tomorrow night?

15:03.236 --> 15:04.338
- Church.
- I'm actually working...

15:04.362 --> 15:06.819
- Did you say church?
- Yeah, you should try it sometime.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.147
I have. We all have.

15:10.159 --> 15:12.445
Well, try again.
Maybe it'll stick.

15:13.621 --> 15:15.157
[Chuckles]

15:24.507 --> 15:27.089
- Can I help you with something?
- What about Saturday?

15:28.761 --> 15:29.796
This is creepy.

15:30.179 --> 15:33.046
The radishes and then
the following me out to my car.

15:33.141 --> 15:34.927
You're... you're just creepy.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.809
- Do you like creepy?
- [Sighs]

15:42.859 --> 15:44.099
I'll tell you what.

15:45.445 --> 15:48.232
You can't so much as kiss me
for five dates.

15:49.157 --> 15:51.569
- And then what?
- Then you can.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.305
[Kyle] What the fuck?
You can't date a local girl.

15:55.329 --> 15:57.285
Bright told us to keep a low profile.

15:57.415 --> 16:01.078
It's no big deal.
I'm not teachin' her our secret handshake.

16:01.169 --> 16:02.604
- You tell bright?
- No, and I apparently

16:02.628 --> 16:03.993
shouldn't have told you.

16:04.630 --> 16:05.961
Yeah, you might be right.

16:11.679 --> 16:13.135
Evening, ma'am.

16:13.222 --> 16:16.680
Oh, those are the pitiful-est
things I've ever seen.

- Are you sure?

[Swin] Yep. [Grunts]

16:35.161 --> 16:38.153

So far it's been a very tight game.

16:47.548 --> 16:48.879
Does it run?

16:48.966 --> 16:50.331
Oh, no, you don't ride it.

16:50.426 --> 16:53.213
- The thing's a curiosity.
- So it don't run?

16:54.055 --> 16:57.468
So you turn a profit
just selling books and socks?

16:57.558 --> 16:59.094
Oh, I don't have to turn a profit.

16:59.185 --> 17:00.954
- It's a great business model.
- [Man] Mm-hmm.

17:00.978 --> 17:04.470
Um, sir, this scooter
is a piece of America.

17:04.565 --> 17:07.146
I don't see why
you wouldn't wanna buy it.

17:07.401 --> 17:09.401
- Oh, I don't care about America.
- [Swin laughing]

17:09.487 --> 17:12.229

the St. Louis cardinals on the radio.

He's kind of a neat guy.

17:20.580 --> 17:24.449
All he does is cook breakfast
and listen to the damn radio.

17:26.671 --> 17:28.536
He's just mean.

17:28.631 --> 17:31.213
He won't give you ten bucks for a rolex.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.308

19:23.371 --> 19:27.910

is a good criminal.

So if you boys ever
catch yourselves startin'

19:31.337 --> 19:34.750
to complain about boredom,
just remember it's better

19:34.840 --> 19:36.626
to have to look for something to do

19:36.717 --> 19:41.461
than have something to do look for you.

She always calls with orders.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.472
Why does she call herself her?

20:26.559 --> 20:29.266
Well, this is pure conjecture,

20:29.353 --> 20:34.723
but I imagine that if our
organization was infiltrated

20:34.817 --> 20:37.524
or somebody wearing a wire
or tappin' phones,

20:37.611 --> 20:43.322
what have you, then all they'd hear
is "her this" and "her that" and..

20:43.492 --> 20:44.572

- Don't be rude.

01:00:17.447 --> 01:00:19.187
Don't be rude.

01:00:19.282 --> 01:00:21.694
- There's a way to treat a lady.
- Thank you.

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:23.619
Where's the ranger?

01:00:24.454 --> 01:00:26.410
He went to Oklahoma with an Indian.

01:00:27.332 --> 01:00:29.072
What kinda car did the Indian drive?

01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:31.453
I think it might've been a kia.

01:00:34.047 --> 01:00:35.457
Could've been a hyundai.

01:00:36.007 --> 01:00:38.589
Just say how the fuck should I know?

01:00:41.096 --> 01:00:43.678
[Chuckles]
I like boys like y'all...

01:00:45.142 --> 01:00:48.555
That don't get hung up
on having a long life.

01:00:54.359 --> 01:00:55.599
Say thank you.

01:00:56.111 --> 01:00:57.631
- [Swin] Thank you.
- [Kyle] Thank you.

01:00:57.779 --> 01:00:58.894
Welcome.

01:01:01.241 --> 01:01:03.106
- Should we go or...
- [Her] Yeah.

01:01:03.201 --> 01:01:04.361
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:01:05.203 --> 01:01:07.819
- [Indistinct TV chatter]
- Hey, dude.

01:01:08.915 --> 01:01:10.530
What the fuck are you doin' in here?

01:01:11.042 --> 01:01:13.374
[Swin] I got the flu.
I came over here to rest.

01:01:13.461 --> 01:01:15.292
Those trailers are so uncomfortable.

01:01:15.797 --> 01:01:17.900
We shouldn't hang out here
except when it's necessary.

01:01:17.924 --> 01:01:21.166
- It could look weird.
- I'm not. It's one day, relax.

01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:22.467
[Knocking on door]

01:01:23.263 --> 01:01:24.673
You expectin' somebody?

01:01:24.764 --> 01:01:26.675
It's just johnna,
she's bringing me some soup.

01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:30.183
You better not be letting her
in on anything, I mean it.

01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:32.886
It's soup.
Would you fuckin' chill?

01:01:34.024 --> 01:01:36.231
- [Johnna] Hey, Kyle.
- Hey. He's in there.

01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:39.351
- [Groans]
- [Johnna] I knew you'd be sick,

01:01:39.446 --> 01:01:43.030
because I was sick two days ago.
I brought you chicken broth.

01:01:43.408 --> 01:01:45.148
Just broth, no soup?

01:01:45.243 --> 01:01:47.450
Trust me. You're the doctor.

01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:49.619
- [Johnna] I'm a nurse actually.
- [Swin chuckles]

01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:53.415
Whoa, this is a nice house.

01:01:53.501 --> 01:01:55.787
This is the nicest house
I've ever been in.

01:01:55.879 --> 01:01:58.666
I mean, it could use
some touches, but, wow.

01:01:58.757 --> 01:02:00.151
[Woman on TV]
You have a bigger quest bath...

01:02:00.175 --> 01:02:02.291
- Who all lives here?
- [Kyle] Our boss.

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:04.341
We can use it,
but not sleep in it.

01:02:05.138 --> 01:02:07.220
[Johnna]
Why? Who else works at this park?

01:02:07.307 --> 01:02:09.719
See? I knew this would happen.
I knew you'd become intrigued

01:02:09.809 --> 01:02:11.845
of me and my glamorous lifestyle.

01:02:11.937 --> 01:02:13.497
We work for a private firm
that's been hired

01:02:13.521 --> 01:02:15.352
to evaluate the state park system.

01:02:15.607 --> 01:02:17.188
Head ranger here was deemed unfit,

01:02:17.275 --> 01:02:19.982
so he got sent to an
Indian reservation in Oklahoma.

01:02:20.737 --> 01:02:23.945
We're just stayin' on to put things right
until he's replaced.

01:02:24.032 --> 01:02:26.193
What exactly are you puttin' right?

01:02:28.453 --> 01:02:31.536
[Sighs]
Mostly just, uh, book keepin', you know?

01:02:31.623 --> 01:02:32.988
But if the house is empty, why...

01:02:33.124 --> 01:02:35.080
No, can't use it.
It's a conflict of interest.

01:02:35.168 --> 01:02:37.250
I mean, nobody'd really know if we did.

01:02:37.337 --> 01:02:39.794
We only come here for meals, okay?

01:02:39.881 --> 01:02:41.041
In fact we're about to leave,

01:02:41.091 --> 01:02:43.131
- s0 we should probably just...
- [Pounding on door]

01:02:44.219 --> 01:02:45.584
You invite somebody else?

01:02:46.471 --> 01:02:47.471
No.

01:02:49.808 --> 01:02:51.048
[Pounding on door]

01:02:55.647 --> 01:02:59.014
Mornin'. Uh, don't be disturbed.

01:02:59.234 --> 01:03:01.646
I'm, uh, here lookin'
for a Patrick bright.

01:03:02.195 --> 01:03:04.402
Uh, head ranger.

01:03:04.948 --> 01:03:06.108
Well, we're not disturbed.

01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:08.110
Ranger bright isn't available right now.

01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:11.948
Maybe I should start over.

01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:14.405
Okay.

01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:16.577
I'm Barry.

01:03:17.168 --> 01:03:19.159
I'm a good friend of...

01:03:19.254 --> 01:03:21.961
Well, my dad was a good friend
of ranger bright's.

01:03:22.048 --> 01:03:24.255
Guys started a tree service
together years ago.

01:03:28.221 --> 01:03:30.337
Yeah, so, anyway, he passed away,

01:03:30.432 --> 01:03:32.718
so I'm drivin' across
the country and visiting

01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:35.175
all of his old pals, you know?
Trying to...

01:03:35.979 --> 01:03:40.939
Anyway. Uh, he always said ranger bright
was one of the good guys, so...

01:03:42.277 --> 01:03:43.437
Here we are.

01:03:43.528 --> 01:03:46.611
He is indeed, but unfortunately
he's not here right now.

01:03:46.865 --> 01:03:49.231
We're the junior rangers.
I'm mollar, that's Suarez.

01:03:53.413 --> 01:03:56.155
- Junior rangers?
- That's what I said.

01:03:57.083 --> 01:03:59.950
- [Chuckles]
- Sorry you came all this way.

01:04:00.253 --> 01:04:03.120
Bright's at a convention in Tulsa.
Somethin' about native American's.

01:04:03.214 --> 01:04:05.079
Oh, is he?
When's he gonna be back?

01:04:05.175 --> 01:04:07.507
They don't tell us.
How about I take your number?

01:04:10.930 --> 01:04:12.591
I'd like to get her number.

01:04:13.266 --> 01:04:15.848
- We don't want any trouble.
- [Swin] No, no, no trouble.

01:04:17.687 --> 01:04:20.349
Oh... you two?

01:04:20.940 --> 01:04:24.273
Well, I wouldn't wanna break up
such a lovely couple.

01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:25.629
[Swin] No danger of that, Barry.

01:04:25.653 --> 01:04:27.894
I'm smarter than you and younger.

01:04:27.989 --> 01:04:29.570
- Are you?
- [Swin] Mm-hmm.

01:04:31.117 --> 01:04:33.699
Well, I'm rich.
I'm not a junior anything.

01:04:36.206 --> 01:04:38.197
Barry, I could buy
that pretty little truck

01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:40.031
out from under you with 100-dollar bills.

01:04:40.126 --> 01:04:41.246
- Could you?
- [Swin] Mm-hmm.

01:04:41.336 --> 01:04:42.938
- Okay, fun's over, man.
- Man, it'd take a lot them

01:04:42.962 --> 01:04:44.106
- 100-dollar bills, buddy.
- See you soon.

01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:46.371
Hey, if you... hey!

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:50.542
Hey, where'd you get all them
100-dollar bills, huh, little man?

01:04:51.388 --> 01:04:52.719
Huh?

01:04:52.806 --> 01:04:54.387
Is that true about the hundreds?

01:04:54.474 --> 01:04:55.714
[Barry] I'll see you soon.

01:04:56.059 --> 01:04:58.596
Mostly. It's complicated.

01:04:58.686 --> 01:05:00.972
[Woman on TV]
All the storage you need and...

01:05:01.064 --> 01:05:03.146
[Johnna] Junior rangers...

01:05:03.858 --> 01:05:04.858
Right?

01:05:04.943 --> 01:05:07.025
And I thought bright
was at remedial training?

01:05:07.362 --> 01:05:09.353
No he... he is. It's, um...

01:05:12.325 --> 01:05:15.863
It's... yeah. It's just all...
It's all complicated.

01:05:15.995 --> 01:05:18.452
It's boring. You don't wanna...
You don't even wanna...

01:05:29.175 --> 01:05:31.415
What are we gonna do
with the money we got from this run?

01:05:33.096 --> 01:05:34.961
Put it in the dryer with the rest.

01:05:35.056 --> 01:05:37.889
Frog will probably be impressed
we held onto it this long, you know?

01:05:37.976 --> 01:05:40.137
Probably already counted it as just lost.

01:05:40.228 --> 01:05:42.344
How much you think he knows?

01:05:42.439 --> 01:05:45.556
Uh, maybe only that something's not right.

01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:49.934
Maybe he knows about every piss we take.

01:05:50.822 --> 01:05:54.861
- Maybe Barry works for frog, too.
- Holy shit. [Chuckles]

01:05:54.951 --> 01:05:56.612
Also a possibility.

01:05:56.703 --> 01:05:58.103
[Kyle]
You know, you might be right.

01:05:58.872 --> 01:06:00.533
Maybe we should get a gun.

01:06:05.545 --> 01:06:07.786
I actually might know
a pawn shop we could check out.

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:14.421
[Frog] It's not Halloween.

01:06:14.512 --> 01:06:16.503
What are these kids doing at my door?

01:06:16.598 --> 01:06:18.134
[Swin]
Oh, Halloween's for baptists.

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:20.704
- [Indistinct chatter on radio]
- [Frog] I suppose that's true.

01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:22.884
Come on in.

01:06:23.563 --> 01:06:24.678
[Swin] Thank you.

01:06:25.023 --> 01:06:27.014
- You remember me?
- [Frog] Well...

01:06:28.443 --> 01:06:29.979
I didn't forget ya.

01:06:30.778 --> 01:06:32.939
This is my buddy, ed. [Groans]

01:06:34.199 --> 01:06:36.064
- Hello, ed.
- Hey.

01:06:37.702 --> 01:06:40.034
- We need guns.
- A gun, singular.

01:06:40.622 --> 01:06:42.032
For what?

01:06:42.123 --> 01:06:45.365
Well, we work over at the park,
and we got our vacation coming up.

01:06:46.294 --> 01:06:49.752
We like to shoot targets to relax,
but all we have is these shitty rifles.

01:06:50.673 --> 01:06:52.959
Our boss said
we should try here for handguns.

01:06:53.051 --> 01:06:55.758
Ranger bright said you should
try to get a gun from me?

01:06:56.179 --> 01:07:00.639
Oh, yeah. He really respects you.
Said nothing mystifies you.

01:07:02.477 --> 01:07:03.557
Hmm.

01:07:05.522 --> 01:07:07.729
Shit. Hang on.

01:07:10.818 --> 01:07:13.901
It's the seventh inning here.
Boys are down.

01:07:13.988 --> 01:07:15.899
[Commentator]
Freeman did and just like that...

01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:17.605
- [Frog] All righty.
- There's one out...

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:19.565
Yeah, we get that game going here.

01:07:19.661 --> 01:07:21.514
He tried to get a little
fancy there and it didn't work out.

01:07:21.538 --> 01:07:23.224
- Sorry about that.
- He really took that lead and...

01:07:23.248 --> 01:07:24.988
- Where were we?
- Guns.

01:07:25.083 --> 01:07:27.665
[Radio continues indistinctly]

01:07:28.127 --> 01:07:29.708
That's right.

01:07:29.796 --> 01:07:32.208
Well, I ain't got no guns, but, uh,

01:07:32.298 --> 01:07:34.004
you can go to little rock
and get ya a gun.

01:07:34.092 --> 01:07:36.208
Well, we got a real problem
with city guns.

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:39.850
We want somethin' from out in the sticks
that someone's dead daddy owned.

01:07:42.767 --> 01:07:44.257
What's the plan for you two?

01:07:45.186 --> 01:07:48.644
- You know, in life?
- Excuse me?

01:07:53.194 --> 01:07:55.059
- Well...
- [Lighter clinking]

01:07:58.324 --> 01:08:01.066
It's not too late to get on
a raft and float downstream...

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:05.704
Because bad things can happen to those
that don't pay the community fees.

01:08:10.545 --> 01:08:11.751
You're a little nutty.

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:13.410
- [Lighter clinking]
- I love it.

01:08:18.303 --> 01:08:22.716
It's fair to say that you traffic
in some underground goods.

01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:26.303
What's the going rate
for a set of human bones?

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:29.050
[Commentator]
That ball swung on.

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:32.063
There's a high drive
into right center field and boy,

01:08:32.191 --> 01:08:33.852
this is gonna hurt us.

01:08:35.319 --> 01:08:38.062
- Depends on the person.
- [Chuckles]

01:08:38.656 --> 01:08:40.192
You gonna sell us a gun or not?

01:08:41.242 --> 01:08:42.573
No, I am not...

01:08:44.621 --> 01:08:46.031
Because in your line of work...

01:08:47.165 --> 01:08:50.157
Guns is as likely to get you killed
as it is to protect ya.

01:08:50.877 --> 01:08:52.332
And what line of work is that?

01:08:57.966 --> 01:08:59.207
Rangering.

01:09:00.261 --> 01:09:01.261
Hmm.

01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:05.546
What's your line of work?

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:11.305
Guess I'm a ranger, too.

01:09:14.108 --> 01:09:15.598
Guess we all are.

01:09:18.112 --> 01:09:19.112
Yeah.

01:09:20.531 --> 01:09:21.691
Okay.

01:09:23.826 --> 01:09:25.191
Thanks for the smoke.

01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:44.176
Where's swin? - Joggin'.

01:09:44.263 --> 01:09:47.220
Said the increased oxygen flow
helps his brain.

01:09:49.268 --> 01:09:50.883
Hmm.

01:09:54.816 --> 01:09:56.602
Can I help you with somethin'?

01:09:56.693 --> 01:10:00.231
[Sighs] I need to know
how long you're stayin'...

01:10:01.072 --> 01:10:02.983
And don't say to ask swin.

01:10:05.410 --> 01:10:07.822
It's impossible to tell right now
and that's the truth.

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:10.278
[Johnna]
He doesn't tell me a thing.

01:10:10.623 --> 01:10:13.365
He won't even tell me
where his family lives. [Chuckles]

01:10:14.711 --> 01:10:17.418
Well, at this moment
we have no plans to leave.

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:20.625
Okay.

01:10:23.594 --> 01:10:26.461
You don't need to tell me
anything exact, but...

01:10:27.932 --> 01:10:29.297
How bad is it?

01:10:30.435 --> 01:10:31.675
What you two do?

01:10:32.937 --> 01:10:36.304
I mean, if you got caught,
how long a sentence are we talking?

01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:39.933
Rangers in trainin'?

01:10:40.862 --> 01:10:43.444
Park auditors? I'm not stupid.

01:10:44.615 --> 01:10:46.355
I should check you for a wire.

01:10:47.744 --> 01:10:49.200
Right.

01:10:51.873 --> 01:10:54.910
I like you, johnna,
but the truth is I don't know you.

01:10:56.961 --> 01:10:59.202
Where would I hide a wire?
[Chuckles]

01:11:00.131 --> 01:11:02.793
- [Sighs]
- Oh, okay.

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:10.463
Yeah, okay.

01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:13.386
Well, it's hard to say
about jail sentences.

01:11:13.478 --> 01:11:16.811
I mean, rapists get off,
pot heads go to prison.

01:11:18.316 --> 01:11:20.556
Depends what kinda evidence
they got or who rats you out.

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:22.225
Sometimes you can buy a way out.

01:11:22.862 --> 01:11:24.818
What is all this?
Are you all right?

01:11:30.495 --> 01:11:32.201
I'm pregnant.

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:33.911
I'm pregnant.

01:11:34.373 --> 01:11:36.910
And I'm tryin' to figure out
how to tell swin.

01:11:37.502 --> 01:11:38.537
I mean, I...

01:11:40.004 --> 01:11:42.290
I could always make
somethin' up and dump him.

01:11:42.632 --> 01:11:45.374
No. No, you can't do that.

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:48.718
- [Sighs]
- Well, you can if you want, but...

01:11:50.681 --> 01:11:52.922
I think you should face...

01:11:53.392 --> 01:11:55.508
Look, I don't know
what I'm trying to say.

01:11:57.814 --> 01:11:59.304
Should you be eating all that candy?

01:11:59.524 --> 01:12:01.765
I just wanna know where I stand.

01:12:04.362 --> 01:12:05.362
Yeah?

01:12:06.072 --> 01:12:08.563
A lot of people think
that parenting is impossible,

01:12:08.658 --> 01:12:10.398
because their own parents were lousy.

01:12:11.744 --> 01:12:13.985
Yeah, I don't know anyone
who had good parents.

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:15.445
[Johnna] I didn't...

01:12:19.210 --> 01:12:21.121
And I turned out all right.

01:12:32.265 --> 01:12:33.550
We're drug runners.

01:12:34.725 --> 01:12:35.805
I ike wholesale.

01:12:38.062 --> 01:12:40.599
We make runs all through
the south down to Florida...

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.857
And park ranger bright,
he was our boss.

01:12:45.611 --> 01:12:48.819
A few weeks ago a guy followed us back
from a run and killed bright.

01:12:49.490 --> 01:12:52.232
We didn't know what to do
or who to tell, so...

01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:56.110
We buried bright's body in the park,

01:12:56.205 --> 01:12:58.446
and I went back and I killed
the guy's grandfather.

01:12:59.667 --> 01:13:01.203
Now we're flyin' blind.

01:13:02.253 --> 01:13:04.585
Sittin' on all this cash.
We don't know what to do with it

01:13:04.672 --> 01:13:06.253
or who to give it to, we just...

01:13:06.841 --> 01:13:09.583
We keep takin' assignments
as they come and doin' our best.

01:13:14.265 --> 01:13:16.426
If we were gonna run away
we'd have done it already...

01:13:17.935 --> 01:13:19.300
As soon as we found the bodies.

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:29.651
[Sighs]

01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:32.730
[Kyle sighs]

01:13:39.457 --> 01:13:40.947
Who am I kiddin'?

01:13:41.042 --> 01:13:42.657
These trailers are pieces of shit.

01:13:43.711 --> 01:13:45.747
We might as well live up
at bright's house.

01:13:48.758 --> 01:13:50.965
[Johnna]
We need to go shopping this weekend.

01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:52.750
This weekend.

01:13:52.929 --> 01:13:55.762
We need to get a stroller,
crib, that kinda thing.

01:13:55.848 --> 01:13:57.088
The list is long.

01:13:57.183 --> 01:13:58.889
I can't this weekend, we got work.

01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:01.975
Okay. Where are you goin'?

01:14:02.647 --> 01:14:03.727
[Sighs]

01:14:05.066 --> 01:14:07.227
I would love to tell you
every little thing that we do,

01:14:07.318 --> 01:14:09.309
but it's better for you if I don't.

01:14:10.154 --> 01:14:12.566
You sound stupid
when you say stuff like that.

01:14:13.074 --> 01:14:14.564
You don't think it's kinda sexy?

01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:18.784
I never thought anything
was sexy in my life.

01:14:18.871 --> 01:14:19.951
- [Chuckles]
- [Door opens]

01:14:20.039 --> 01:14:21.870
I don't. [Chuckling]

01:14:23.876 --> 01:14:25.912
Why did you get a soda?
We got that here.

01:14:26.128 --> 01:14:29.837
- Value meal.
- [Car approaching]

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:33.503
That old frat boy came back.

01:14:34.303 --> 01:14:36.635
[Car door opens, closes]

01:14:36.722 --> 01:14:37.962
He is determined.

01:14:39.392 --> 01:14:41.348
[Barry]
Hey, sweetheart, where you goin'?

01:14:41.435 --> 01:14:42.675
You ain't gonna say hi?

01:14:44.730 --> 01:14:46.766
Oh, you never called.

01:14:47.817 --> 01:14:49.273
I didn't wanna torture you.

01:14:50.569 --> 01:14:53.311
Hey, Barry.
Is your daddy still dead?

01:14:53.656 --> 01:14:57.023
Yep. I take it, uh,
Mr. bright ain't available?

01:14:57.493 --> 01:14:58.608
Afraid not.

01:14:58.703 --> 01:15:00.659
Bright actually got transferred
to Oklahoma.

01:15:00.871 --> 01:15:02.907
[Laughs]

01:15:03.749 --> 01:15:05.080
Oklahoma.

01:15:06.544 --> 01:15:08.876
- Come on, where is he?
- Barry, what makes you think

01:15:08.963 --> 01:15:11.375
that I'd give a flying fuck
if you talk to bright or not?

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:16.424
[Clears throat]

01:15:19.098 --> 01:15:20.929
Anybody thirsty?

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:25.372
[Clears throat] Barry, I think
it'd be best if we made you

01:15:25.396 --> 01:15:27.136
that lemonade to go
and got you on your way.

01:15:30.985 --> 01:15:32.316
We should do that.

01:15:34.697 --> 01:15:38.281
Why would I bother myself tryin'
to figure all this out anyway, you know?

01:15:38.784 --> 01:15:40.490
[Barry laughs]

01:15:44.248 --> 01:15:45.454
You know what's funny?

01:15:46.459 --> 01:15:47.869
Every time I come over here...

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:52.461
You boys are here, just hangin' out.

01:15:54.675 --> 01:15:57.883
Nothin' to do, hmm?

01:15:59.472 --> 01:16:01.508
Seem a bit suspicious to you?

01:16:02.099 --> 01:16:03.555
Hmm?

01:16:07.938 --> 01:16:10.304
How about you?
You know where Mr. bright is?

01:16:11.609 --> 01:16:13.600
[Pitcher shatters]

01:16:13.694 --> 01:16:15.230
Oh, my god.
Don't look, don't look.

01:16:15.321 --> 01:16:17.049
Look at me, look at me,
look at me, look at me.

01:16:17.073 --> 01:16:18.609
Hey, look at me.
Don't look at him.

01:16:18.699 --> 01:16:21.315
You're okay.
You're okay. You're okay.

01:16:22.036 --> 01:16:23.446
It's okay.

01:16:24.288 --> 01:16:25.994

I was in grad school.

- Well, it has to cost somethin'.

01:17:56.422 --> 01:17:58.253
We don't need money.
We live with our aunt.

Our aunt don't really care
what we do all day.

01:18:14.982 --> 01:18:16.392
She believes what we tell her.

01:18:18.319 --> 01:18:20.856
What if you told her
y'all went off to college?

01:18:20.946 --> 01:18:23.562
Well, she'd think we was off to college.

01:18:25.075 --> 01:18:26.565
How do you like being mechanics?

01:22:14.847 --> 01:22:16.087
j they went j

01:22:16.181 --> 01:22:19.639
[vocalizing]

01:22:23.355 --> 01:22:26.017
[Men grunting]

01:22:28.152 --> 01:22:29.152
If you're wrong...

01:22:30.446 --> 01:22:31.526
You pay the price.

01:22:32.865 --> 01:22:36.278
- [Man] Hey, um...
- [Tim] Attitude.

01:22:36.368 --> 01:22:37.824
I don't know anything.

01:22:39.413 --> 01:22:42.120
That's just the way things
play out in this kinda life.

01:22:43.333 --> 01:22:45.198
I try not to take it personally.

01:22:45.294 --> 01:22:47.000
J there goes the Robert e. Lee j

01:22:47.671 --> 01:22:50.583
j now I don't mind choppin' wood j

01:22:50.674 --> 01:22:51.709
am I gonna die?

01:22:51.842 --> 01:22:54.834
J I don't care if the money's no good j

01:22:54.928 --> 01:22:57.135
- j' but they should never j
- I don't...

01:22:57.306 --> 01:23:00.639
- J' have taken the very best j
- Most likely.

01:23:00.809 --> 01:23:05.553
J the night they drove
old Dixie down &

01:23:05.689 --> 01:23:06.724
[man choking]

01:23:06.857 --> 01:23:08.973
J and all the people were singin';

01:23:09.067 --> 01:23:10.773
j they went j

01:23:10.861 --> 01:23:12.943
[vocalizing]

01:23:17.201 --> 01:23:20.443
Seven-fifty in cash,
half a million in assets.

01:23:20.829 --> 01:23:22.490
This is what you call next level.

01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:25.155
We got buyin' power now.

01:23:26.001 --> 01:23:27.457
We need to expand.

01:23:27.544 --> 01:23:29.910
Well, gang bangers are taking
more streets day by day.

01:23:30.005 --> 01:23:32.917
We're gonna have to set up
some high-end exclusives.

01:23:33.008 --> 01:23:34.589
But what do you think, frog?

01:23:35.594 --> 01:23:38.802
I think you can grow the business
any damn way you wanna grow the business.

01:23:39.389 --> 01:23:42.347
It's your business now.
You do what you want with it.

01:23:43.227 --> 01:23:44.433
I trust you.

01:23:46.438 --> 01:23:47.874
[Thomas]
You feeling all right, boss?

01:23:47.898 --> 01:23:50.059
[Tim] Maybe you took
too many hits to the head.

01:23:51.485 --> 01:23:55.854
The only mistake my mentor ever made,
was not knowin' when to step aside and...

01:23:57.115 --> 01:23:59.197
I don't want it to be like that with us.

01:24:00.494 --> 01:24:02.234
Yeah, it's time I handed it over.

01:24:03.914 --> 01:24:05.074
You boys are ready.

01:24:07.834 --> 01:24:11.326
Semi-retirement has a luxurious tone
to it, don't you think?

01:24:14.341 --> 01:24:15.581
It does to me.

01:24:17.511 --> 01:24:19.968
I'll find me a small place
out in the country,

01:24:20.055 --> 01:24:22.091
maybe over by bright's park.

01:24:22.349 --> 01:24:24.590
I'll open up a little curio shop.

01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:27.893
Sleep late, go to bed early,
sell people shit

01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:29.220
they don't need in between.

01:24:29.314 --> 01:24:31.805
We wanna have as much
good debt as possible.

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:34.357
One day we're gonna be
level six investors.

01:24:34.444 --> 01:24:36.605
[Thomas]
Right. Like true capitalists...

01:24:36.697 --> 01:24:39.029
[Frog] I'll be like those
mob bosses in movies.

01:24:40.409 --> 01:24:42.570
Sittin" around in pizza joints,
gettin' fat.

01:24:45.998 --> 01:24:47.909
It's a privilege I owe to you.

01:24:49.001 --> 01:24:51.117
You boys have made this possible...

01:24:52.212 --> 01:24:55.124
And unless there are people
stupid enough to provoke me...

01:24:56.091 --> 01:24:59.879
Stupid enough to create
a threat to us or our business,

01:24:59.970 --> 01:25:02.803
be it through youth
or cockiness or ignorance...

01:25:04.391 --> 01:25:07.724
Or whatever brand of idiocy
it would require...

01:25:11.106 --> 01:25:13.643
I'll gladly lie dormant
in my little shell...

01:25:14.359 --> 01:25:15.895
While you two run the show.

01:25:24.328 --> 01:25:25.568
Sorry about that.

01:25:28.290 --> 01:25:29.370
Where were we?

01:25:38.717 --> 01:25:41.504
[Kyle] My actions don't seem
fo have any consequence.

01:25:41.595 --> 01:25:42.880
[Pounding on door]

01:25:43.305 --> 01:25:44.886
Someone might still come to kill us,

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:47.510
but it seems less likely
with each passing day.

01:25:49.603 --> 01:25:52.140
Near as I can tell,
bright's death was my promotion.

01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:57.141
I guess as long
as his operation is runnin',

01:25:57.235 --> 01:25:58.850
frog don't care who's runnin' it.

01:25:58.945 --> 01:26:01.186
- Cornelius.
- Beautiful.

01:26:01.281 --> 01:26:02.862
- Beautiful.
- Like planet of the apes.

01:26:02.949 --> 01:26:05.315
- Oh, yeah.
- [Kyle] I'd like to meet frog.

01:26:05.410 --> 01:26:06.679
[Swin] It's a good movie though.

01:26:06.703 --> 01:26:08.097
[Kyle] I'd like to know
what he thinks of me,

01:26:08.121 --> 01:26:10.988
as much for curiosity's sake
as self-preservation.

01:26:11.083 --> 01:26:12.368
[Fireworks exploding]

01:26:12.501 --> 01:26:14.537
I'd like to look him in the eye...

01:26:17.381 --> 01:26:18.917
And see if it looks like a mirror.

01:26:25.764 --> 01:26:28.176
Packets on hold
until I talk to ranger bright.

01:26:28.892 --> 01:26:30.177
What?

01:26:32.062 --> 01:26:33.927
[Her] What? Oh!

01:26:34.022 --> 01:26:36.638
Y'all interrupting my exercise time.

01:26:36.733 --> 01:26:37.813
Exercise?

01:26:38.777 --> 01:26:41.644
Why would you be exercising
if you wanna die as soon as possible?

01:26:41.738 --> 01:26:46.027
I wonder what your rude friend
wants to do if I don't have a packet, hmm?

01:26:46.118 --> 01:26:48.359
I intend to kill you by strangulation.

01:26:48.495 --> 01:26:51.828
Now, it'll be suicide,
'cause I'm giving you a fuckin' warning.

01:26:51.915 --> 01:26:53.621
Why not just shoot me?

01:26:53.709 --> 01:26:55.665
All I brought are my big strong hands.

01:26:55.752 --> 01:26:58.710
What, do you roll the ball
around in a circle 500 times?

01:26:58.797 --> 01:27:00.333
Shut your ass up.

01:27:00.424 --> 01:27:01.960
[Kyle]
Is this an order from frog?

01:27:02.884 --> 01:27:05.751
Frog said no more packets until he
finds out what's happenin' over here?

01:27:05.846 --> 01:27:06.881
That's right.

01:27:06.972 --> 01:27:08.852
He wants to know what happened
to ranger bright.

01:27:08.932 --> 01:27:11.452
Right, and we're probably supposed to
tell you so you can tell him.

01:27:11.476 --> 01:27:13.637
- Right.
- Bull fuckin' shit.

01:27:13.729 --> 01:27:15.515
Are you the boss of this whole thing?

01:27:16.022 --> 01:27:18.013
- Don't be an idiot.
- [Swin] Wait a minute.

01:27:18.108 --> 01:27:21.225
- Are you the frogman?
- [Her chuckling]

01:27:21.319 --> 01:27:23.355
You have no intuition.

01:27:23.447 --> 01:27:24.732
Intuition is for women.

01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:27.697
You don't need to worry
about intuition right now.

01:27:28.618 --> 01:27:32.361
What you need to worry about is the fact
that you're an unnecessary middleman.

01:27:32.456 --> 01:27:34.321
We've been thinking about streamlining.

01:27:34.416 --> 01:27:37.499
Frog will be impressed if we can make
this operation more efficient.

01:27:37.586 --> 01:27:38.746
You are superfluous.

01:27:39.296 --> 01:27:42.333
What the fuck does that mean?
You can't do that.

01:27:42.424 --> 01:27:43.880
You can't streamline.

01:27:43.967 --> 01:27:45.820
We do a whole bunch of shit
we're not supposed to do.

01:27:45.844 --> 01:27:47.960
Frog don't seem to mind.
You don't understand.

01:27:48.764 --> 01:27:51.506
I'm a buffer.
I'm a vital layer of insulation.

01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:55.058
[Chuckles] Mmm.

01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:59.938
I'm convinced you have a packet in here,
and I refuse to tear the place up.

01:28:00.609 --> 01:28:03.567
Now, you're gonna hobble
right over and get it for me.

01:28:04.029 --> 01:28:05.894
[Swin]
How does one practice intuition?

01:28:07.073 --> 01:28:08.688
- Do you pray?
- Mm-hmm.

01:28:08.784 --> 01:28:11.571
Most prayers sound hollow in your head.

01:28:11.661 --> 01:28:14.027
But every once in a while one echoes.

01:28:14.831 --> 01:28:16.662
That's the same as intuition.

01:28:17.042 --> 01:28:18.828
I'll pray for you if you pray for me.

01:28:18.919 --> 01:28:19.954
The packet!

01:28:20.837 --> 01:28:22.998
It's stuffed in the ball you asshole.

01:28:23.089 --> 01:28:25.796
- What the fuck?
- Why would you hide it from us?

01:28:25.884 --> 01:28:28.250
'Cause I was scared, just like y'all are.

01:28:28.345 --> 01:28:30.586
Now, I wanna know
what happened to ranger bright.

01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:31.760
He was my friend.

01:28:31.848 --> 01:28:33.429
Your friend? Yes.

01:28:33.517 --> 01:28:35.428
You think that distributing
a Manila envelope

01:28:35.519 --> 01:28:37.430
every two weeks constitutes a friendship?

01:28:37.521 --> 01:28:40.012
- To me and the ranger it did.
- [Exhales]

01:28:43.109 --> 01:28:44.269
[Kyle] Oh.

01:28:45.153 --> 01:28:46.518
We're not scared.

01:28:47.113 --> 01:28:49.695
You said we're scared,
same as you, but that's wrong.

01:28:51.535 --> 01:28:52.615
We're not.

01:29:30.323 --> 01:29:32.109
Consider that your baby shower.

01:29:47.173 --> 01:29:48.538
I'm sorry.

01:29:48.925 --> 01:29:50.040
You're right.

01:29:53.722 --> 01:29:56.134
"Sandra bullock is the happiest
she's ever been.

01:29:56.224 --> 01:29:58.055
She views her divorce
and its fall out

01:29:58.143 --> 01:30:00.179
as a blessing
and something she grew from."

01:30:01.271 --> 01:30:02.681
I'm sorry, but those magazines

01:30:02.772 --> 01:30:05.058
are the canary and the coal mine
of western civilization.

01:30:05.150 --> 01:30:09.143
- Stop it. They're fun.
- It's materialism run rampant.

01:30:09.237 --> 01:30:11.853
All that celebrity worship
and trash culture.

01:30:11.948 --> 01:30:14.439
It's drivin' everybody crazy
and they don't even realize it.

01:30:14.534 --> 01:30:16.320
Keep talking, professor.

01:30:16.411 --> 01:30:18.402
What do you think
all these zombie movies

01:30:18.496 --> 01:30:21.738
and post-apocalyptic stories
are about the last few years?

01:30:21.833 --> 01:30:23.369
- What?
- All these children's novels

01:30:23.460 --> 01:30:25.187
about over throwin'
the government and fighting

01:30:25.211 --> 01:30:26.939
- each other to death.
- What are you talkin' about?

01:30:26.963 --> 01:30:28.828
It's mass projection.

01:30:29.049 --> 01:30:31.461
Everybody wants the world to end,

01:30:31.551 --> 01:30:33.946
because if that's what's passing
for the American dream these days

01:30:33.970 --> 01:30:35.380
they all wanna opt out.

01:30:36.598 --> 01:30:40.557
- Of what?
- Of everything, fuckin' society.

01:30:40.644 --> 01:30:43.306
Is that what you picture you did?
Opt out?

01:30:43.772 --> 01:30:45.182
Touché.

01:30:45.273 --> 01:30:47.480
- [Johnna giggles]
- You wanna know the big reveal?

01:30:47.567 --> 01:30:49.478
- Hmm?
- You can't opt out.

01:30:50.612 --> 01:30:53.649
You can't, I tried.
I thought I had done it.

01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:55.355
But look at me.

01:30:57.327 --> 01:31:00.285
Here I am.
Still ended up with a boss, a job,

01:31:00.372 --> 01:31:02.283
and a wacky coworker
and a baby on the way.

01:31:09.673 --> 01:31:11.004
[Johnna] It's a boy.

01:31:21.351 --> 01:31:23.763
[Chuckles] Is that a fact?

01:31:24.312 --> 01:31:25.893
It is.

01:31:27.732 --> 01:31:29.188
- Boy?
- [Johnna] Yeah.

01:31:30.694 --> 01:31:32.150
[Exhales] [Chuckles]

01:31:33.655 --> 01:31:37.022
I'd like to get the baby
some savings bonds for, you know,

01:31:37.117 --> 01:31:38.402
save up for college.

01:31:41.037 --> 01:31:42.322
Or clown school?

01:31:43.456 --> 01:31:47.119
Or open a gun range. [Chuckles]

01:31:52.257 --> 01:31:53.918
Why won't you marry me?

01:31:58.263 --> 01:32:01.596
I don't not want to get married, but...

01:32:03.351 --> 01:32:05.888
We're still in the infatuation stage.

01:32:05.979 --> 01:32:09.892
Even though we're having a kid together
there's no denying that we're infatuated.

01:32:09.983 --> 01:32:12.224
That would be hard to deny.

01:32:13.236 --> 01:32:16.478
We should wait until after we're not
attracted to each other anymore

01:32:16.573 --> 01:32:19.485
to make a decision about marriage.

01:32:19.576 --> 01:32:22.409
- It just doesn't make sense.
- What if that never happens?

01:32:24.122 --> 01:32:25.578
Just give it time.

01:32:26.583 --> 01:32:27.743
[Swin chuckles]

01:32:33.798 --> 01:32:35.163
[Frog] Colin was killed.

01:32:36.426 --> 01:32:38.883
Cops busted into his shop and shot him...

01:32:40.305 --> 01:32:42.261
Lookin' for information about a car

01:32:42.348 --> 01:32:44.964
and a dead kid they pulled
outta the swamp.

01:32:47.562 --> 01:32:49.894
Ranger bright's body
hasn't been found, but...

01:32:51.274 --> 01:32:53.390
I'm pretty sure he's been killed, too.

01:32:53.943 --> 01:32:56.810
I sent Barry over there to investigate.

01:32:57.781 --> 01:32:59.191
Now he's missing.

01:33:02.243 --> 01:33:05.576
They come here
and scare you half to death.

01:33:09.125 --> 01:33:12.583
Then they stop by my shop,
ask me if I wanted to...

01:33:13.254 --> 01:33:15.415
Purchase a set of human bones.

01:33:17.675 --> 01:33:19.631
These two are supposed to be
workin' for me.

01:33:21.304 --> 01:33:23.795
They're about the worst enemies
I've ever had.

01:33:26.726 --> 01:33:30.184
I never had anybody kill my
associates or steal my money.

01:33:32.816 --> 01:33:34.522
Whether they have a plan...

01:33:35.735 --> 01:33:39.068
Or they're just lost in a maze
of their own fuck ups,

01:33:39.155 --> 01:33:40.645
it don't matter now.

01:33:41.491 --> 01:33:42.571
They're stupid.

01:33:45.370 --> 01:33:46.985
That's what makes them dangerous.

01:33:49.541 --> 01:33:50.872
They'll be caught soon.

01:33:52.961 --> 01:33:55.247
And whatever happens
after they've been caught...

01:33:56.506 --> 01:33:57.541
Well...

01:33:59.551 --> 01:34:02.384
Whatever would've happened
after they've been caught

01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:03.960
ain't never gonna happen.

01:34:07.016 --> 01:34:10.850
You're gonna give 'em one last package.

01:34:14.983 --> 01:34:16.439
One last trip.

01:34:20.530 --> 01:34:22.361
Somethin' to make them
feel comfortable.

01:34:23.700 --> 01:34:25.406
Make it close to hot Springs.

01:34:29.831 --> 01:34:32.117
They'll feel lucky like, uh...
[Chuckles]

01:34:33.293 --> 01:34:35.033
Something's goin' right for 'em.

01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:43.212
Nothing's ever gonna go right
for them again.

01:35:00.778 --> 01:35:02.143
Love you, baby.

01:35:04.073 --> 01:35:05.108
Sure you do.

01:35:21.382 --> 01:35:22.713
We shouldn't be here.

01:35:24.552 --> 01:35:25.837
[Gun cocks]

01:35:30.975 --> 01:35:33.682
Gray Cyprus, Kentucky.
Tell johnna, gray Cyprus.

01:35:33.770 --> 01:35:34.770
[Thomas] What'd you say?

01:35:34.854 --> 01:35:36.390
- That's your sisters?
- Mm-hmm.

01:35:36.481 --> 01:35:37.596
Don't be talkin' in code.

01:35:38.983 --> 01:35:40.848
Is he your brother or your husband?

01:35:40.944 --> 01:35:43.230
[Chuckles] He's funny.

01:35:45.114 --> 01:35:46.274
Frisk 'em.

01:35:51.955 --> 01:35:53.286
[Swin grunts]

01:36:00.255 --> 01:36:02.746
- They're clean.
- Get in the tub.

01:36:07.136 --> 01:36:10.503
You, come on. Let's go. Get.

01:36:10.848 --> 01:36:11.928
Let's go.

01:36:23.069 --> 01:36:25.151
Let's go. Let's go, move.

01:36:25.697 --> 01:36:28.359
[Swin] Oh, you act tough now,
but we'll be friends.

01:36:29.033 --> 01:36:30.833
Everybody that meets me
wants to be my friend.

01:36:38.334 --> 01:36:39.995
We work for you, don't we?

01:36:41.796 --> 01:36:43.332
[Scoffs]

01:36:44.841 --> 01:36:47.708
[Kyle]
So what were we supposed to do, hmm?

01:36:47.802 --> 01:36:50.088
What would you have done if you were us?

01:36:50.179 --> 01:36:51.419
[Tim] Well...

01:36:53.308 --> 01:36:57.176
We both know you ain't gotta do anything
to get in this spot...

01:36:58.021 --> 01:36:59.602
And I ain't you.

01:37:01.024 --> 01:37:02.605
Not by a long shot.

01:37:05.570 --> 01:37:08.061
Nah, you're a fat fuckin' slob.

01:37:08.156 --> 01:37:09.771
[Chuckles]

01:37:10.408 --> 01:37:13.070
What about the pawn shop guy
that doesn't sell anything?

01:37:13.661 --> 01:37:14.946
What do you think?

01:37:16.289 --> 01:37:18.450
I was starting to think he was frog.

01:37:26.466 --> 01:37:29.833
He was right there the whole time.

01:37:29.927 --> 01:37:31.792
[Chuckles]

01:37:31.888 --> 01:37:33.844
So this outfit's based in little rock?

01:37:33.931 --> 01:37:36.263
It ain't based anywhere.

01:37:36.351 --> 01:37:39.218
Why so secretive?
You're planning to kill me, right?

01:37:39.312 --> 01:37:42.725
Oh, it's way passed the planning stages.

01:37:44.567 --> 01:37:46.228
First we need that cash...

01:37:46.903 --> 01:37:50.111
Location of the bodies, the girl.

01:37:50.198 --> 01:37:51.984
You should question swin.

01:37:52.075 --> 01:37:53.531
I'm not bothered by torture.

01:37:53.618 --> 01:37:55.483
Well, if I was gonna question swin,

01:37:55.578 --> 01:37:58.991
I'd have to hurry, 'cause he
gonna be dead in a minute...

01:38:00.041 --> 01:38:01.497
And if you keep being such a pain,

01:38:01.584 --> 01:38:03.870
well, we'll just go ahead
and shoot you in the head, too.

01:38:04.754 --> 01:38:08.713
We don't need the money that bad,
and we can find the girl on our own.

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:11.507
- The girl doesn't know shit.
- Apparently not...

01:38:12.220 --> 01:38:14.006
Hangin' out with you two losers.

01:38:16.474 --> 01:38:17.714
If I was you...

01:38:18.559 --> 01:38:20.470
I'd go ahead and speed the plan up.

01:38:23.398 --> 01:38:26.060
Keepin' me alive is only
gonna end badly for you.

01:38:27.276 --> 01:38:29.767
Don't embarrass yourself
trying to scare me.

01:38:33.282 --> 01:38:35.944
Of course, your brother's
the only one allowed to have a gun,

01:38:36.035 --> 01:38:37.366
so we'll have to wait.

01:38:40.039 --> 01:38:42.359
Why don't you just go ahead
and shut the fuck up right now?

01:38:45.628 --> 01:38:47.038
[Chuckles]

01:38:53.219 --> 01:38:56.256
[Gunshots]

01:38:58.516 --> 01:38:59.551
[Groans]

01:39:02.228 --> 01:39:04.344
[Grunting]

01:39:07.442 --> 01:39:09.353
[Kyle]
Why do people keep doin' stuff?

01:39:11.696 --> 01:39:13.607
Wipin' counters down...

01:39:14.949 --> 01:39:18.157
Takin' pictures, cheatin',
offendin' things?

01:39:19.328 --> 01:39:21.284
Fuck is the point?

01:39:24.667 --> 01:39:25.998
It's evolved.

01:39:26.085 --> 01:39:29.168
[Both grunting]

01:39:37.346 --> 01:39:40.179
[Swin] Many schools of thought,
but, in layman's terms,

01:39:40.266 --> 01:39:44.134
being the most sophisticated monkey
also makes you the most confused monkey.

01:39:44.228 --> 01:39:47.436
So takin' action, any action at all,

01:39:47.523 --> 01:39:49.684
is a way to alleviate that confusion.

01:39:49.775 --> 01:39:51.561
What's your line of work?

01:39:54.155 --> 01:39:55.816
Guess I'm a ranger, too.

01:39:58.618 --> 01:39:59.903
Guess we all are.

01:40:00.912 --> 01:40:03.278
[Both grunting]

01:40:06.042 --> 01:40:09.785
[Tim groaning]

01:40:16.802 --> 01:40:20.340
[Tim sobbing]

01:41:07.103 --> 01:41:10.595
[Sobbing]

01:41:36.966 --> 01:41:38.797
[Knocking]

01:41:52.481 --> 01:41:54.688
Jesus, just go ahead and tell me.

01:41:57.612 --> 01:41:58.772
Uh...

01:41:59.864 --> 01:42:01.354
Swin was never scared.

01:42:06.329 --> 01:42:09.071
He never begged or tried to sell me out.

01:42:10.041 --> 01:42:11.121
He was just...

01:42:12.168 --> 01:42:14.250
He was exactly swin to the last.

01:42:18.591 --> 01:42:21.958
You got ten minutes to pack up
and leave Arkansas for good.

01:42:23.971 --> 01:42:26.633
Here's the money for you and the baby.

01:42:28.976 --> 01:42:31.592
You go to Kentucky and you find
a town called gray Cyprus.

01:42:31.687 --> 01:42:33.143
That's where swin's family lives.

01:42:35.566 --> 01:42:36.726
Kentucky?

01:42:37.860 --> 01:42:40.192
Swin's got, like, 40 sisters.

01:42:40.821 --> 01:42:43.528
Little guy will have more attention
than he knows what to do with.

01:42:46.327 --> 01:42:47.658
[Johnna groans]

01:42:54.669 --> 01:42:57.536
[Sighs]
The baby knows something's happening.

01:43:00.925 --> 01:43:02.631
His real last name's horn.

01:43:05.971 --> 01:43:07.211
I know.

01:43:08.432 --> 01:43:09.467
[Sighs]

01:43:14.355 --> 01:43:15.845
You could come with me.

01:43:17.441 --> 01:43:20.308
No, I couldn't.
It wouldn't be safe for ya.

01:43:21.404 --> 01:43:23.690
I know, I just wanted
to at least have said it.

01:43:27.618 --> 01:43:29.609
Where... where are you gonna go?

01:43:30.579 --> 01:43:31.785
[Kyle] I don't know.

01:43:35.584 --> 01:43:36.869
I liked it here...

01:43:40.423 --> 01:43:43.085
And I liked livin" with you and swin.

01:43:43.843 --> 01:43:45.333
I don't know where...

01:44:14.165 --> 01:44:15.496
[Frog] Kyle's gone.

01:44:16.041 --> 01:44:17.872
You got a choice to make, Thomas.

01:44:18.127 --> 01:44:20.869
You can spend your whole life
lookin' for revenge.

01:44:22.339 --> 01:44:23.704
Go crazy...

01:44:24.759 --> 01:44:26.215
And ruin yourself.

01:44:29.013 --> 01:44:30.344
Or you can get passed it.

01:44:31.682 --> 01:44:32.842
Run the business.

01:44:36.103 --> 01:44:37.218
You hear me?

01:44:37.313 --> 01:44:39.895
[Tim] One day we're gonna be
level six investors.

01:44:39.982 --> 01:44:41.835
[Thomas]
Right, like, true capitalists, you know?

01:44:41.859 --> 01:44:43.599
We're gonna own everything together.

01:44:43.694 --> 01:44:45.776
- You know, like a team, like...
- I ike a team.

01:44:45.863 --> 01:44:48.063
Yeah, yeah. Like, but like us,
you know what I'm sayin'?

01:44:48.365 --> 01:44:49.885
- You want some of this?
- Yes, please.

01:44:50.284 --> 01:44:51.694
So it's all just gone?

01:44:52.453 --> 01:44:54.068
That's it?

01:44:54.163 --> 01:44:55.163
I'm broke?

01:44:56.540 --> 01:45:00.203
Thomas sold everything.
He cashed out all the accounts.

01:45:01.003 --> 01:45:02.618
Stocks, bonds, you name it.

01:45:03.088 --> 01:45:05.249
He said, "time is of the essence."

01:45:05.716 --> 01:45:07.672
Thomas said, "time if of the essence?"

01:45:09.136 --> 01:45:10.136
Well...

01:45:11.096 --> 01:45:13.132
He said, "hurry the hell up”
is what he said.

01:45:13.224 --> 01:45:14.339
[Chuckles]

01:45:15.184 --> 01:45:17.266
This is the danger of a joint account.

01:45:17.853 --> 01:45:21.095
Even if someone's like family,
hell, is family...

01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:25.186
We can never really be sure
what goes on in another human's mind.

01:45:27.571 --> 01:45:28.686
Ain't that right?

01:45:29.907 --> 01:45:31.272
Mm-hmm.

01:46:13.909 --> 01:46:16.901
[Fire crackling]

01:46:18.664 --> 01:46:21.531
- [Man] Yeah, who's this?
- Froggy from Memphis.

01:46:22.001 --> 01:46:24.583
- [Man] Who?
- Colin's boss.

01:46:24.795 --> 01:46:27.787
[Man] / thought Colin's bosses
were two big twins.

01:46:27.882 --> 01:46:30.248
Yeah, I was their boss.
I had to let 'em all go.

01:46:30.384 --> 01:46:32.796
[Man] Frog? Frog? [Chuckling]

01:46:32.887 --> 01:46:36.596
Okay, I know who you are.
Figured you'd be retired by now.

01:46:36.682 --> 01:46:39.719
I tried, but, uh, you know,
it didn't suit me.

01:46:40.769 --> 01:46:42.384
I'm gettin' my hand back in.

01:46:42.855 --> 01:46:43.935
What I need...

01:46:44.607 --> 01:46:46.723
Is a weekly shipment to Oklahoma city.

01:46:47.109 --> 01:46:48.690
[Iman] Can't do it.

01:46:48.777 --> 01:46:52.235
In Oklahoma it's all meth,
and meth is all local.

01:46:52.323 --> 01:46:54.405
Oklahoma's a bad choice.

01:46:54.491 --> 01:46:57.028
These days it's nothin'
but scumbags in the business.

01:46:57.119 --> 01:46:58.700
Well, there's always been scumbags.

01:46:59.872 --> 01:47:01.282
I'm a scumbag.

01:47:02.625 --> 01:47:04.866
[Man] I'll tell you what,
take this number down.

01:47:05.252 --> 01:47:07.709
Anybody who can get you
started it's cq.

01:47:07.796 --> 01:47:10.003
- You got a pen?
- Come on with it.

01:47:10.090 --> 01:47:12.923
[Man] 947-5583.

01:47:16.013 --> 01:47:17.048
Got ya.

01:47:17.139 --> 01:47:19.380
[Man]
Like I said, Oklahoma is no good.

01:47:19.725 --> 01:47:21.215
Don't say I didn't warn ya.

01:47:22.061 --> 01:47:24.598
[Dial tone]

01:47:26.565 --> 01:47:29.056
[Clock ticking]

01:47:30.027 --> 01:47:31.027
[Chuckles]

01:47:32.821 --> 01:47:34.607
[Chuckles]

01:47:38.243 --> 01:47:40.450
[Frog]
Oklahoma's whatever I say it is.

01:47:41.622 --> 01:47:43.487
If Arkansas is what I say it is...

01:47:45.084 --> 01:47:47.040
Oklahoma's what I say it is.

01:47:49.296 --> 01:47:50.502
I'll start with nothin'.

01:47:52.424 --> 01:47:54.130
Maybe I'll get me some new boys.

01:47:56.720 --> 01:47:57.755
Maybe I won't.

01:47:59.848 --> 01:48:02.555
Maybe [I'll work for somebody else.
[Chuckles]

01:48:03.519 --> 01:48:05.259
That'd be a fuckin' hoot.

01:48:15.823 --> 01:48:17.654
One day my story will come to light.

01:48:19.743 --> 01:48:21.279
It'll be pieced together...

01:48:23.205 --> 01:48:24.320
Passed down...

01:48:25.916 --> 01:48:28.373
Exaggerated, doubted...

01:48:31.171 --> 01:48:32.661
Insisted upon.

01:48:40.347 --> 01:48:42.554
I will have a grand final act.

01:48:45.769 --> 01:48:47.725
Looks like Thomas found ya.

01:48:48.731 --> 01:48:49.846
Yeah.

01:48:51.108 --> 01:48:52.188
He's dead.

01:48:53.944 --> 01:48:55.229
And then some.

01:48:56.572 --> 01:48:59.564
[Frog] I'm a killer. You're not.

01:49:00.034 --> 01:49:01.069
I'm smart...

01:49:02.161 --> 01:49:04.447
You're not. I'm the boss.

01:49:04.872 --> 01:49:08.456
You may never refuse an order,
and you may never quit.

01:49:08.834 --> 01:49:11.621
[Chuckles]
Now, I never asked for my life

01:49:11.712 --> 01:49:13.418
