02:38.166 --> 02:42.500
THE MANSION

03:01.791 --> 03:03.875
-Not now!
-Okay.

03:04.208 --> 03:06.708
First we turn on the electricity.

03:06.875 --> 03:09.416
-Sure it's not here?
-Stop, silly.

03:09.583 --> 03:11.166
Here. Take the dog.

03:12.625 --> 03:14.458
-Be careful.
-Yeah.

03:18.375 --> 03:19.333
This castle!

03:19.625 --> 03:20.958
It's a movie set!

03:21.125 --> 03:23.375
Found it on the net.
Really cheap.

03:23.541 --> 03:27.208
Half the price!
We needed something special.

03:27.375 --> 03:30.583
Totally. It's awesome.
Very thriller style.

03:30.750 --> 03:32.750
-It's in bad shape.
-Come on...

03:32.916 --> 03:34.125
Even disgusting.

03:36.125 --> 03:39.125
Why are we in the middle of nowhere?

03:39.291 --> 03:41.791
-I knew it. No network.
-No way!

03:41.958 --> 03:43.666
-Really?
-Zero bars.

03:45.458 --> 03:47.208
Bruno, the damn suitcases!

03:47.583 --> 03:49.416
-Sorry.
-Take the suitcases.

03:49.583 --> 03:51.166
So what do you guys think?

03:51.500 --> 03:54.916
This rules!
I never slept in a castle before.

03:55.083 --> 03:57.250
-Like princesses.
-Absolutely.

03:57.416 --> 04:01.500
It looks like my military school.
Pretty creepy.

04:01.666 --> 04:04.291
Chill, it's New Year's.
It'll be fun.

04:04.458 --> 04:06.458
I don't know.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.666
Drazik, wake up. We're here.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.833
So this is Belgium.

04:19.791 --> 04:20.875
Beautiful.

04:22.041 --> 04:24.750
-What's your cousin's name?
-Ask her.

04:24.916 --> 04:26.375
My name is Charlotte.

04:27.125 --> 04:30.833
Boys, we need a hand
with the bags here.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.833
Yes. I'm here!

04:34.583 --> 04:36.875
What's the Wi-Fi password?

04:37.041 --> 04:41.458
If you'd read my last e-mail,
you'd know there's no Wi-Fi.

04:42.250 --> 04:44.083
-There's no Wi-Fi?
-No.

04:44.250 --> 04:48.791
No network. No Wi-Fi. Wild idea!
We're going to have fun.

04:48.958 --> 04:51.083
Your ex is going to bust our balls.

04:51.250 --> 04:52.416
Tell me about it.

04:52.583 --> 04:54.708
Guys! Who cares about the Wi-Fi?

04:54.875 --> 04:58.708
Let's relax, re-energize.
Take care of ourselves.

04:59.583 --> 05:01.333
-Walk in the woods.
-Stop!

05:01.500 --> 05:03.500
Let's forget about walks!

05:03.666 --> 05:06.916
It's a well-known hunting reserve.

05:07.083 --> 05:09.583
-What kind?
-What? Gnus? Horses?

05:09.750 --> 05:10.666
Wild boars.

05:10.833 --> 05:14.000
The owners advised us
no walks in the woods.

05:14.166 --> 05:16.750
I have no reason to go there anyways.

05:16.916 --> 05:18.125
-Scared?
-No.

05:18.291 --> 05:20.333
-Yes, you are.
-Whatever. No!

05:20.500 --> 05:24.041
Can we go,
I really need to take a dump.

05:24.333 --> 05:26.875
-Can you take my suitcase?
-Yes!

05:27.041 --> 05:29.666
I'll do it.
Bruno, take mine.

05:29.833 --> 05:30.958
Yes, fine, okay.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.208
Perfect inspiration for my next part.

05:38.833 --> 05:41.291
I'm not scared but it's creepy.

05:41.625 --> 05:43.416
Can you hear that?
Crows.

05:43.708 --> 05:46.291
That's a good sign, buddy.

05:46.458 --> 05:48.500
Corneille's beautiful.

05:48.666 --> 05:50.375
Isn't that a singer?

05:50.541 --> 05:52.625
It's a town:
Corneille-Essonne.

05:54.041 --> 05:55.208
Hawks, not easy.

05:56.041 --> 05:57.333
It's a game.

05:57.500 --> 05:59.875
-Take the luggage.
-Yes!

06:01.208 --> 06:02.916
-That's not nice!
-Scared?

06:03.083 --> 06:04.750
No I'm not scared.

06:05.416 --> 06:06.500
Not scared.

06:06.666 --> 06:11.458
This mansion belonged
to Baron Gluckenstein Muller.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.583
I've set up the rooms.

06:27.750 --> 06:31.458
Bruno with Drazik. Stephan with Djamal.
Sam with Jess.

06:31.625 --> 06:34.083
-We can't pick our own rooms?
-No.

06:34.250 --> 06:36.875
-A problem?
-"A problem?" No problem.

06:37.083 --> 06:38.166
Nasty.

06:43.166 --> 06:47.708
You were last minute,
so the small room down the hall.

06:47.875 --> 06:51.041
-There's no heater.
-It doesn't bother me.

06:51.208 --> 06:52.500
One more thing.

06:52.666 --> 06:56.250
The 2nd floor is closed.
No electricity, so stay out.

06:56.416 --> 07:00.041
I left the deposit,
please don't break anything.

07:00.208 --> 07:01.750
Butt fart.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.291
Nice, Djamal.

07:03.500 --> 07:07.166
Dinner's at 9:30.
Don't forget the evening theme:

07:07.333 --> 07:08.875
The years 2000.

07:09.625 --> 07:10.750
Who gives a shit!

07:12.291 --> 07:13.833
Who am I sleeping with?

07:14.041 --> 07:15.916
Let me check my register.

07:17.208 --> 07:19.541
You're with me and Kitty.

07:19.708 --> 07:22.166
It's going to be a great weekend.

07:41.875 --> 07:42.708
What is it?

07:45.083 --> 07:47.250
It's quite simple.
I have it all.

07:47.458 --> 07:48.291
Natural.

07:48.458 --> 07:52.000
100% organic.
200% hallucinogen.

07:52.166 --> 07:53.916
Weed from three continents.

07:54.083 --> 07:56.791
Mild climates. Tropical.
Arid regions.

07:56.958 --> 07:58.333
Home rolled hashish.

07:59.041 --> 08:01.041
Absinthe. Vodka.

08:03.666 --> 08:05.208
Mexican mushrooms.

08:05.416 --> 08:06.250
I even have...

08:08.375 --> 08:10.291
a Tibetan frog, Pauline.

08:10.875 --> 08:12.041
Lick her back

08:14.291 --> 08:16.916
and see your ancestor's soul.
-Well then.

08:17.666 --> 08:19.958
Why did you bring this here?

08:20.375 --> 08:21.541
Don't worry.

08:21.708 --> 08:25.416
It's only what nature gives us.
Not the pharmacist's shit.

08:25.750 --> 08:27.041
Thanks a lot.

08:27.250 --> 08:28.250
What for?

08:28.416 --> 08:29.791
My mom's a pharmacist.

08:30.375 --> 08:33.457
But, you're not taking over
the business.

08:33.625 --> 08:34.916
I'm taking over the business.

08:35.082 --> 08:38.457
But it's not your passion.
It's not a personal...

08:38.625 --> 08:40.125
It's a personal choice.

08:40.375 --> 08:42.875
Okay. Fine. But I mean

08:43.457 --> 08:46.750
you're not a pharmacist yet?
Your mom's not dying?

08:50.916 --> 08:52.791
I'm sorry.

08:56.500 --> 08:58.458
Sit down, man.
Are you okay?

08:59.666 --> 09:01.708
Well no, I'm not.

09:04.416 --> 09:05.583
She's not dead

09:05.750 --> 09:09.708
but those images made me feel bad.
I'm sorry.

09:13.833 --> 09:15.750
I just had a panic attack.
I'm fine.

09:15.916 --> 09:17.875
Perfect.
I have what you need.

09:18.041 --> 09:19.833
No, I'm fine.
I want nothing.

09:20.166 --> 09:21.250
Nor does Stephan,

09:21.416 --> 09:25.750
who just broke up with Sam,
and he thinks they're on a break.

09:25.958 --> 09:27.125
Can't hurt him.

09:27.291 --> 09:30.916
He says it's a common decision.
To think it over.

09:31.083 --> 09:33.250
She sure did.

09:37.958 --> 09:38.916
How so?

09:39.166 --> 09:41.291
-She slept with a guy.
-No way!

09:41.458 --> 09:42.375
Who?

09:42.958 --> 09:43.791
I can't say.

09:43.958 --> 09:46.833
Fuck! You're a secret keeper!

09:47.083 --> 09:49.000
I don't want to know.

09:49.166 --> 09:50.791
-Enzo.
-No way!

09:50.958 --> 09:52.375
Fuck, the bastards.

09:52.541 --> 09:53.833
Why isn't he here?

09:54.000 --> 09:55.625
-It's none of our business.
-No.

09:55.791 --> 09:59.708
In my opinion,
you know I can feel people.

09:59.875 --> 10:00.916
That's true.

10:01.083 --> 10:03.708
I can tell you I get Sam.

10:04.250 --> 10:06.291
She'll give him a chance.

10:08.083 --> 10:10.500
I'd rather have sex with a bum.

10:10.666 --> 10:13.208
I'd be scared,
filled with excitement.

10:13.458 --> 10:15.833
Stephan's worse than routine.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.666
Every day's the same.

10:17.833 --> 10:18.708
Yeah, the routine.

10:19.375 --> 10:20.208
Exactly.

10:21.750 --> 10:24.625
I'm happy it's over!
I was about to explode.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.666
I'm almost 25
which means almost old.

10:27.833 --> 10:30.375
What's left?
3 years to enjoy my body.

10:30.833 --> 10:32.875
Even less.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.666
I don't care. I have a career plan.

10:36.833 --> 10:40.000
In one year I'll be a stewardess.
In two, crew chief.

10:40.166 --> 10:43.083
Who wants a man
born with a slipper on his dick.

10:44.333 --> 10:47.166
You know what?
Let's hook him up with your cousin.

10:47.583 --> 10:50.750
He'll forget you by banging her.

10:50.916 --> 10:53.125
She'll loosen up.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.083
You're silly.

10:55.250 --> 10:59.291
She's uptight. Almost autistic.
She has no friends.

10:59.458 --> 11:03.000
My aunt said:
she needs to open up to the world.

11:03.166 --> 11:06.166
That's why a gust of wind
should open her up.

11:06.458 --> 11:09.500
Stephan's no gust of wind.

11:09.833 --> 11:13.416
He's more like a light breeze.

11:17.250 --> 11:18.833
Like a draft.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.166
Sex was crazy, you know.

11:27.500 --> 11:32.500
You can't forget 5 years of passion.
It's not fucking possible.

11:42.041 --> 11:43.916
I stopped smoking for her.

11:50.250 --> 11:51.250
Are you listening?

11:51.916 --> 11:52.750
Shit happens.

11:53.583 --> 11:54.583
You have to move on.

11:55.083 --> 11:56.541
I had problems,
look at me today.

11:57.083 --> 11:59.791
I'm auditioning for a Hollywood movie.

12:01.125 --> 12:02.625
Put that away.
It's disgusting.

12:02.791 --> 12:03.750
Jealous!

12:04.375 --> 12:07.041
Your American dream is ridiculous.

12:07.791 --> 12:11.500
It might be, but I have plans.
What's yours after college?

12:11.666 --> 12:14.541
It depends on Samantha.

12:15.291 --> 12:18.250
It's been 6 months.
Why persist? Let it go.

12:18.541 --> 12:21.416
It's a classical thing.
You met too young.

12:21.583 --> 12:23.916
No, 5 months and 10 days.
Explain too young?

12:24.083 --> 12:27.916
Samantha's young.
She needs new experiences.

12:28.083 --> 12:29.125
New experiences?

12:29.291 --> 12:32.875
I don't know, travel, go out, party.

12:33.041 --> 12:35.250
-Sleep with men?
-I didn't say that.

12:35.416 --> 12:36.916
That's what you think.

12:40.750 --> 12:42.250
Maybe you want to fuck her too?

12:42.416 --> 12:44.125
-What?
-Already done?

12:49.041 --> 12:50.416
You fucked her?

12:51.041 --> 12:51.875
No.

12:55.458 --> 12:56.833
He fucked her!

12:57.000 --> 12:59.250
He fucking fucked her!

12:59.416 --> 13:01.125
With your big dick!
Disgusting.

13:01.291 --> 13:03.666
Seriously?
I'd fuck my boy's girl?

13:03.833 --> 13:05.541
She only has eyes for you.

13:05.958 --> 13:07.708
-I'm not crazy.
-No!

13:07.875 --> 13:09.208
-Feel it?
-I saw it.

13:09.375 --> 13:11.916
-The way she looks at you.
-I felt it too.

13:12.083 --> 13:13.250
-I saw it.
-Saw it too.

13:13.416 --> 13:14.333
I felt it.

13:14.500 --> 13:16.708
-Thank you.
-You're welcome, man.

13:16.875 --> 13:18.208
I knew it.

13:19.208 --> 13:21.208
Can we get back to...

13:21.375 --> 13:22.208
Yeah!

13:22.750 --> 13:23.625
Go.

14:01.708 --> 14:03.000
Cheers!

14:03.875 --> 14:05.041
Bottom's up!

14:05.208 --> 14:07.041
I'll miss you my ugly girls.

14:08.833 --> 14:11.250
-Stephan, you're a pain.
-What?

14:11.416 --> 14:13.958
-Respect the dress code.
-Yeah!

14:14.125 --> 14:17.166
2000's bore me.
I have a shirt, piss off.

14:17.500 --> 14:18.875
Watch your mouth.

14:19.541 --> 14:20.791
We're not alone!

14:21.708 --> 14:23.791
I saw it. It had big horns.

14:23.958 --> 14:25.083
Big eyes.

14:31.250 --> 14:33.458
And cut!
It's a wrap! Good job!

14:34.000 --> 14:34.833
It was great!

14:35.000 --> 14:37.166
-Nightmare's over.
-Not funny.

14:37.333 --> 14:39.583
No monster!
I was staging the show.

14:39.750 --> 14:43.125
Cause I had an audition,
I didn't get the part.

14:43.375 --> 14:45.291
-A drink, Bruno?
-No thanks.

14:45.458 --> 14:48.041
-Have a small drink.
-Just a little.

14:48.208 --> 14:49.708
Just a little one.

14:53.250 --> 14:54.666
Sexy drinker!

14:58.000 --> 14:59.333
You have a thing.

14:59.625 --> 15:03.875
That's an arrest by the book.
Block the forearm. Blocked!

15:04.500 --> 15:05.333
I can't move.

15:05.500 --> 15:08.916
Why does a woman beat you?
It's embarrassing.

15:09.541 --> 15:10.583
What's your problem?

15:11.750 --> 15:12.458
What?

15:12.625 --> 15:13.750
You want one?

15:16.375 --> 15:17.875
Are you serious?

15:18.208 --> 15:20.958
-Lift the arm up. There.
-Fuck!

15:22.000 --> 15:23.541
Fuck! I slipped.

15:24.458 --> 15:26.583
It happens sometimes, yeah.

15:26.750 --> 15:28.166
We're talking about a legend.

15:31.625 --> 15:34.625
The guy suffered.
He had a band aid.

15:34.791 --> 15:36.041
What did Will Denzey do?

15:36.208 --> 15:38.083
"The wall of sound."

15:38.250 --> 15:41.166
<span style="style.default_1">Stand up, loosen up,</span>
<span style="style.default_1">now it has to blow up!</span>

15:41.333 --> 15:44.291
Regarding that, it's true.

15:49.333 --> 15:50.541
Take it easy.
We have all night.

15:50.916 --> 15:52.541
It's New Year's!
It's once a year.

15:52.708 --> 15:53.916
Go on. Drink.

15:54.083 --> 15:57.125
For me it's the best fuck
of the year.

15:58.291 --> 16:01.375
I remember one new year,

16:01.541 --> 16:03.791
Stockholm in a sauna,

16:03.958 --> 16:06.916
I got it so bad!

16:08.708 --> 16:11.000
That's a good topic.

16:11.166 --> 16:13.875
The craziest place you had sex?

16:14.041 --> 16:15.541
Good question.

16:17.833 --> 16:19.916
Bruno, for example.

16:24.666 --> 16:26.291
If you already had sex.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.291
The guy never had sex.

16:38.416 --> 16:39.375
Consenting adults?

16:40.708 --> 16:41.708
Yeah.

16:44.958 --> 16:46.250
Family doesn't count?

16:47.625 --> 16:48.458
No.

16:49.208 --> 16:50.250
Well then I pass.

16:52.041 --> 16:53.541
He's so silly.

16:53.875 --> 16:56.916
You're a funny drinker.
Have another shot.

16:57.083 --> 16:58.958
What about you, Djamal?

16:59.625 --> 17:00.916
Your best experience?

17:01.291 --> 17:04.208
"What about you, Djamal?
Your best experience?"

17:04.375 --> 17:06.708
One not ending up in a hospital?

17:07.415 --> 17:09.083
It's not a legend?

17:09.540 --> 17:12.665
It's a 40cm legend,
like a steak.

17:12.833 --> 17:15.125
Stop talking about my dick!

17:15.290 --> 17:17.290
You know how it feels,
people staring?

17:17.458 --> 17:20.333
Look the kid with a 30cm willy.

17:20.583 --> 17:23.625
When I got accused for stealing
baseball bats.

17:24.415 --> 17:25.915
Take out the baseball bat!

17:26.375 --> 17:27.415
No, it's a weenie.

17:27.583 --> 17:30.250
It's not just my dick.
I also have huge balls.

17:30.416 --> 17:32.500
I've had a scoliosis for two months.

17:32.666 --> 17:35.000
I'm 23.
I should be in great shape.

17:35.166 --> 17:37.583
But it's heavy
in between my legs.

17:39.291 --> 17:40.833
I'd rather be like Stephan.

17:48.416 --> 17:49.833
Why are you laughing?

17:51.750 --> 17:54.750
So, you guys haven't told us?

17:54.916 --> 17:55.791
Unusual places?

17:58.125 --> 17:59.000
In a mansion.

18:00.250 --> 18:01.458
They didn't waste time.

18:02.208 --> 18:03.833
Just to clarify,

18:04.291 --> 18:07.083
lately we've been trying
to conceive life.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.166
He's a studious boy.
He does his homework.

18:13.708 --> 18:16.041
I'm rigorous on ovulations.

18:16.208 --> 18:17.958
Not only ovulations.

18:18.791 --> 18:19.625
We're eating.

18:19.916 --> 18:20.750
That's sexy.

18:20.916 --> 18:21.958
Come on!

18:22.125 --> 18:23.958
The strangest place you've had sex?

18:24.666 --> 18:26.833
You know me, I'm a saint.

18:28.291 --> 18:29.208
Why are you laughing?

18:29.500 --> 18:33.125
When did you have sex last?
Berlin Teknival with punk ass dogs?

18:33.458 --> 18:34.541
With dogs?

18:34.708 --> 18:36.750
Turns out, not at all.

18:37.541 --> 18:38.666
Really want to know?

18:39.125 --> 18:40.000
Yeah.

18:40.625 --> 18:41.375
Tell us.

18:44.708 --> 18:48.208
It was on the Costa Brava.
A hot summer night.

18:49.333 --> 18:53.458
A Bossa Nova group
playing smooth tunes.

18:53.791 --> 18:55.791
I won't paint a picture.

18:56.208 --> 18:59.041
We made love, we held each other.

18:59.333 --> 19:00.875
Like glow-worms,

19:01.416 --> 19:02.291
closing our bodies.

19:03.625 --> 19:06.416
My fingers intertwined in her hair.

19:06.625 --> 19:08.333
Her hair intertwined with algae.

19:09.583 --> 19:11.250
Algae intertwined

19:11.791 --> 19:12.750
with the cosmos.

19:15.833 --> 19:17.208
I'll never forget.

19:18.708 --> 19:21.166
Romantic.
Who was it?

19:21.458 --> 19:22.875
Don't know.
Too fucked up.

19:28.583 --> 19:31.083
Since we're in romance
I propose a toast.

19:31.416 --> 19:32.583
Or a loaf.

19:33.666 --> 19:34.500
That's impro.

19:36.750 --> 19:39.416
Thanks to my baby
who planned all this.

19:39.583 --> 19:40.666
Thanks, Nad!

19:41.083 --> 19:45.375
Thank you all for playing along
except Stephan.

19:45.750 --> 19:46.916
You're welcome.

19:47.708 --> 19:51.250
As you all know,
I never met my parents.

19:51.750 --> 19:53.875
Since we've known each other

19:54.083 --> 19:56.458
for me you've become a real family.

19:56.625 --> 19:59.666
Even if you're all going
your own way soon,

19:59.958 --> 20:03.250
I hope we'll always
be together like tonight.

20:05.041 --> 20:06.625
-To us!
-To us!

20:08.625 --> 20:09.916
Always the right words.

20:10.166 --> 20:11.125
Cheers!

20:11.291 --> 20:12.541
Oh sweetie!

21:04.291 --> 21:06.041
This one's
for Fabrice and Nadine!

21:06.208 --> 21:07.500
Here we go!

22:00.500 --> 22:02.333
Ready for the next one!

22:27.375 --> 22:30.333
Fuck! I set them on fire.

22:30.500 --> 22:32.333
Why did I stop dance class?

22:33.291 --> 22:34.750
We can't do it all.

22:35.833 --> 22:37.083
I'm an actor.

22:37.250 --> 22:38.458
What are you doing?

22:39.333 --> 22:41.208
-Preparing dessert.
-Heavy.

22:42.500 --> 22:43.833
Here, taste.

22:44.000 --> 22:44.916
No!

22:47.250 --> 22:49.125
Fuck, chives, shit!

22:52.750 --> 22:54.000
No chive here...

23:11.041 --> 23:11.875
It's time!

23:13.125 --> 23:16.000
The moment we all have been waiting for!

23:17.041 --> 23:18.541
All together.

23:18.708 --> 23:22.833
10, 9, 8, 7, 6,

23:23.375 --> 23:24.541
5, 4,

23:25.083 --> 23:27.208
3, 2, 1...

23:27.375 --> 23:28.875
Happy New Year!

23:45.083 --> 23:46.416
That's fucking good.

23:53.041 --> 23:54.291
You okay?

23:57.708 --> 23:59.333
Not really.

23:59.666 --> 24:01.833
I think I want to go home.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.541
I don't feel well.

24:05.208 --> 24:07.125
Want to taste?

24:07.458 --> 24:11.000
It's my recipe. Mexican cupcakes.
Three mushrooms.

24:11.958 --> 24:13.625
-Yeah?
-That's original.

24:13.791 --> 24:15.666
Tell me about it. Wait.

24:26.250 --> 24:27.083
Yeah?

24:27.250 --> 24:29.083
-It's really good.
-Yes?

24:29.250 --> 24:30.666
I love sweet and sour taste.

24:31.291 --> 24:34.458
Teonanacatl.
Mexican for God's flesh.

24:35.208 --> 24:36.375
The best of the best

24:36.541 --> 24:37.833
of the best mushrooms.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.125
Okay.

24:39.666 --> 24:44.000
The Juarez family.
Mushroom cultivator 7 generations.

24:46.041 --> 24:46.916
You know what?

24:47.625 --> 24:50.458
Take as much as you want.
I'll make more.

24:52.583 --> 24:53.416
Charlotte?

24:54.458 --> 24:55.291
Okay.

25:10.333 --> 25:11.208
Here!

25:12.625 --> 25:15.500
You're the kind
no one should lose sight.

25:22.416 --> 25:24.250
Bruno's hot!

25:24.583 --> 25:26.833
Bruno!

26:35.583 --> 26:37.291
Bruno!

26:55.541 --> 26:56.833
Fucking disgusting.

26:57.375 --> 26:58.208
You okay?

26:58.375 --> 26:59.291
Disgusting.

27:52.291 --> 27:53.458
This is shit.

28:10.375 --> 28:11.791
You.

28:12.875 --> 28:13.708
Come here!

28:15.000 --> 28:17.250
Fucking piece of shitty dog.

28:17.833 --> 28:21.208
You had all night to take a shit.
And you do it

28:21.541 --> 28:23.041
on Bruno's feet!

28:23.208 --> 28:25.083
Bruno isn't happy!

28:25.250 --> 28:26.291
-Seen Kitty?
-I'm fed up!

28:26.666 --> 28:28.000
You pigheaded bitch.

29:41.416 --> 29:43.291
I made you a grog.

29:43.750 --> 29:44.708
Thank you.

29:44.875 --> 29:46.125
Grandma's recipe.

29:47.000 --> 29:48.333
You'll feel better.

29:52.583 --> 29:53.583
What is it?

29:53.916 --> 29:55.291
Water.

30:02.291 --> 30:05.875
So, Bruno,
explain how you found a headless dog?

30:07.666 --> 30:08.875
I already told you,

30:09.916 --> 30:11.666
I don't know.

30:12.750 --> 30:15.375
The dog took a shit, I threw up.

30:16.708 --> 30:18.500
And the head was...

30:18.708 --> 30:19.791
the head...

30:19.958 --> 30:22.041
We don't understand shit.

30:22.208 --> 30:23.166
An otter.

30:24.250 --> 30:25.083
Or a wild boar.

30:25.583 --> 30:28.458
A wild boar?
Who cuts heads off?

30:28.833 --> 30:30.041
Really?

30:30.375 --> 30:31.958
I think it's...

30:32.916 --> 30:34.500
a lurker...

30:34.666 --> 30:36.791
-Or someone in the woods.
-Bruno.

30:37.125 --> 30:37.958
No.

30:38.125 --> 30:39.958
-Maybe so.
-No.

30:45.375 --> 30:47.875
We're going to bed.
We'll try to sleep.

30:48.541 --> 30:50.416
We'll leave tomorrow morning.

30:51.666 --> 30:53.000
Try to enjoy the mansion.

30:54.166 --> 30:55.708
Enjoy what?

30:56.041 --> 30:58.291
With Bruno's slaughter?
I'm not staying.

30:58.458 --> 31:00.208
You did this to Kitty?

31:01.416 --> 31:02.708
No, it wasn't me.

31:04.375 --> 31:06.208
I love animals.
I couldn't do that.

31:08.625 --> 31:10.583
Hunters love animals too.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.541
I said it's not me.

31:12.708 --> 31:13.958
After they kill them.

31:14.125 --> 31:15.291
Stop it, Stephan,

31:15.666 --> 31:18.750
you know it's not Bruno.
He's our friend.

31:18.916 --> 31:20.083
We all know each other.

31:21.416 --> 31:22.416
True.

31:22.583 --> 31:23.416
Except Charlotte.

31:24.375 --> 31:26.625
I don't know her.
Do you know her?

31:27.458 --> 31:28.708
I saw her,

31:29.125 --> 31:30.291
a little while ago.

31:31.250 --> 31:34.125
Where is she?
When did you see her last?

31:35.083 --> 31:37.208
Don't know. We arrived at 5?

31:38.833 --> 31:40.208
Around 5 or 6.

31:41.958 --> 31:43.541
She was at dinner.

31:43.708 --> 31:45.375
What a fucking idiot!

31:46.500 --> 31:47.375
Charlotte?

31:47.875 --> 31:49.125
She must be in her room.

31:54.458 --> 31:56.458
-Anyone have a tissue?
-Shut up!

32:12.208 --> 32:13.875
This is the devil's home.

32:16.083 --> 32:17.875
You're all in danger.

32:18.208 --> 32:20.666
Evil has killed all of my own.

32:21.916 --> 32:23.583
Leave as soon as you can.

32:25.208 --> 32:26.041
Go!

32:31.666 --> 32:33.750
Fuck!
Charlotte's not in her room.

32:33.916 --> 32:35.833
She disappeared!

32:36.791 --> 32:38.416
Fuck! I lost my cousin.

32:38.583 --> 32:41.250
My aunt's going to kick my ass!

32:41.416 --> 32:43.833
Don't worry, we'll find her.

32:46.125 --> 32:47.958
Lower your voices,
Nadine's resting.

32:48.625 --> 32:50.250
Charlotte disappeared.

32:50.416 --> 32:51.458
What?

32:52.791 --> 32:55.291
I say we pack our bags and go.

32:55.625 --> 32:56.541
Big wuss!

32:57.625 --> 33:00.333
We can't count on you.
She's Sam's cousin.

33:00.666 --> 33:03.708
She's family.
We don't abandon family.

33:04.041 --> 33:06.000
-I'm here, baby.
-Not your baby.

33:06.333 --> 33:07.291
Wait a minute.

33:07.458 --> 33:10.458
She can't be far.
Let's make a plan.

33:10.625 --> 33:11.541
I'll go downstairs.

33:11.916 --> 33:13.416
-Me too.
-I'll go too.

33:14.083 --> 33:15.750
Three pairs of eyes.

33:16.625 --> 33:18.750
Bruno and Jess, the 2nd floor.

33:19.583 --> 33:21.458
Drazik and Djamal, check outside.

33:22.791 --> 33:23.958
Meet back in 15 minutes?

33:27.250 --> 33:28.208
We have to find her.

33:29.041 --> 33:31.125
I feel something,
like I'm in my movie.

33:31.416 --> 33:32.250
Let's go!

33:41.000 --> 33:42.083
Charlotte?

33:44.458 --> 33:46.083
What's the target?

33:46.250 --> 33:48.750
Mammal or human being.

33:48.958 --> 33:50.666
I don't give a shit, big guy.

33:50.833 --> 33:53.833
Animal or not, I'll fuck it up.
Check this.

34:20.041 --> 34:22.250
It's a damn moth!
Fucking shit!

34:24.708 --> 34:25.666
Fuck.

34:28.625 --> 34:30.416
You're not to be fucked with.

34:31.791 --> 34:32.916
Charlotte?

34:33.708 --> 34:36.291
Is this Hollywood career serious?

34:36.458 --> 34:38.833
-Of course it is, man.
-Really?

34:39.041 --> 34:42.416
I've got business plans.
Business cards.

34:42.583 --> 34:46.750
Hollywood movies won't come right away.

34:46.916 --> 34:50.125
First small parts.
Got to start somewhere.

34:50.291 --> 34:52.708
The greatest did it.
Step by step.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.583
Come what may.

34:57.416 --> 34:58.416
Fucking beautiful.

35:21.791 --> 35:23.291
Slow down.

35:24.375 --> 35:25.666
Our lamp's dead.

35:27.083 --> 35:28.625
Why are we on this floor?

35:29.250 --> 35:30.416
To find what?

35:31.541 --> 35:32.541
Besides rats.

35:32.708 --> 35:34.583
Scaredy-cat.

35:34.750 --> 35:36.125
I'm not scared.

35:36.458 --> 35:39.833
If she's hiding,
how are we supposed to find her?

35:40.000 --> 35:42.125
With her small voice,
she'll yell.

35:43.416 --> 35:44.833
We won't hear her.

35:45.041 --> 35:46.000
Slap in the ass.

35:46.666 --> 35:47.500
Slap in the ass.

35:48.291 --> 35:49.125
Slap in the ass?

35:50.208 --> 35:51.750
Is that a proposal?

35:51.916 --> 35:52.750
No.

35:54.250 --> 35:56.291
It's... because...

35:56.791 --> 35:58.541
it's the battery mechanism,

35:58.708 --> 36:01.000
it must be defective.

36:03.291 --> 36:05.083
Look. What is it?

36:05.458 --> 36:06.875
It's a door.

36:07.875 --> 36:09.583
I know, it's a door.

36:10.791 --> 36:12.625
I get these kinds of doors.

36:12.791 --> 36:14.083
-Really?
-Yeah.

36:15.166 --> 36:16.041
We can't go.

36:16.541 --> 36:17.750
This kind never opens.

36:19.208 --> 36:21.666
This one opened.

36:24.458 --> 36:25.583
Charlotte?

36:31.875 --> 36:34.041
Damn, look, cages and shit.

36:34.541 --> 36:38.291
I need to call my agent.
It's a fucking movie set.

36:39.250 --> 36:40.791
You have an agent?

36:41.041 --> 36:43.125
No, but when I do, I'll tell him.

36:43.416 --> 36:45.250
In need, I'll be your agent.

36:45.416 --> 36:46.541
We'll see.

36:46.916 --> 36:49.166
For now,
I need to nail my part.

36:49.916 --> 36:51.125
What's the script?

36:52.416 --> 36:55.000
It's about a guy
with a big past.

36:56.208 --> 37:00.375
And he meets a girl
with a big crazy past too.

37:00.791 --> 37:03.833
It's a secret project.
I can't talk about it.

37:04.291 --> 37:05.875
Coming soon.
You'll see.

37:09.416 --> 37:10.333
Look.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.166
Come on, Djamal.

37:25.750 --> 37:26.958
You can do it.

37:36.500 --> 37:38.333
-What's wrong?
-My weed.

37:38.666 --> 37:40.041
Seriously, man?

37:40.416 --> 37:42.000
Fuck, I have a heart condition.

37:44.416 --> 37:45.291
Fuck.

37:46.416 --> 37:47.375
Motherfucker.

37:47.750 --> 37:49.458
Did I shit on myself?

37:57.041 --> 37:59.208
Come up,
it's just an attic.

38:10.291 --> 38:11.541
Charlotte?

38:15.833 --> 38:18.541
-There, let's go.
-Bruno! Come here now.

38:19.250 --> 38:20.791
You have no balls.

38:28.083 --> 38:28.916
Wait for me.

38:32.833 --> 38:34.000
Charlotte?

38:38.208 --> 38:40.541
Not so loud.
She'll hear us.

38:40.708 --> 38:42.250
Isn't that the point?

38:45.375 --> 38:47.416
Fuck. I have a bar.

38:47.708 --> 38:48.958
I have a bar.

38:49.875 --> 38:51.458
What kind of bar?

39:00.291 --> 39:01.375
I lost it.

39:01.916 --> 39:03.208
That's a shame.

39:25.541 --> 39:27.833
Look. A picture of the mansion.

39:32.291 --> 39:33.500
Can you hold this?

39:34.000 --> 39:34.833
Yes.

39:39.916 --> 39:42.666
"Disturbing missing person alert
at the Mansion.

39:43.166 --> 39:44.875
A little..." Flash me.

39:45.041 --> 39:47.791
"An eight-year-old girl
disappeared.

39:47.958 --> 39:50.500
Still searching in the woods.

39:50.666 --> 39:52.750
Satanic rumors about the Mansion.

39:53.041 --> 39:56.833
No sign of the body of the little...

39:57.000 --> 39:58.208
Charlotte!"

40:07.458 --> 40:08.708
She's not here. Let's go.

40:09.375 --> 40:10.416
Wait a minute.

40:15.291 --> 40:16.500
The owner has good taste.

40:17.708 --> 40:19.250
Saint Ã‰tienne 1874.

40:19.416 --> 40:22.000
Caliber 20.
Perfect with game animals.

40:23.125 --> 40:25.916
-You know shot guns?
-That's weird.

40:26.583 --> 40:29.500
You don't know everything about me.

40:32.208 --> 40:33.041
What's this?

40:33.625 --> 40:36.041
"Taxidermy"?

40:51.875 --> 40:53.083
Fuck.

40:53.791 --> 40:55.250
Fuck!

40:56.458 --> 40:57.500
Charlotte?

41:09.375 --> 41:11.375
That's what I call archaeology.

41:14.250 --> 41:16.125
Handy, precise.

41:16.291 --> 41:18.833
I must say it's a nice weapon.

41:19.000 --> 41:19.833
What's up?

41:20.208 --> 41:22.125
Stop. Got it. Put it down.

41:23.375 --> 41:24.958
Can't we have fun?

41:26.666 --> 41:27.583
It's not funny.

41:27.958 --> 41:29.625
Too light to be loaded.

41:34.583 --> 41:35.750
It's ok.

41:35.916 --> 41:37.750
It's not that shameful.

41:40.500 --> 41:42.458
The greatest have done it.

41:42.625 --> 41:45.083
Don't aim it at me, freak!
I'm scared.

41:45.250 --> 41:47.333
What are you scared of?

41:48.083 --> 41:49.958
Nothing to be scared of.

41:50.916 --> 41:52.375
Trust me.

41:52.541 --> 41:53.375
Right, Sam?

41:54.416 --> 41:56.458
One day my face will be here.

42:01.833 --> 42:03.083
What is it?

42:14.083 --> 42:15.291
No. Fuck.

42:15.458 --> 42:18.500
Stomy?
Fuck no! Not now.

42:21.541 --> 42:24.916
Calm down. Think.
What doesn't make me hard?

42:26.333 --> 42:27.625
My father naked.

42:27.791 --> 42:28.750
Oysters,

42:28.916 --> 42:31.625
tooth aches, dentist appointments,

42:32.291 --> 42:35.791
a strike, a flat tire on a bike,

42:36.208 --> 42:38.125
a rally, a bike,

42:38.958 --> 42:43.458
a Fiat Multipla,
the first name Romuald, Yann Moix.

42:50.500 --> 42:53.666
Fuck!
You're such an asshole!

42:53.833 --> 42:55.208
She's right.
You almost hurt us.

42:55.375 --> 42:58.208
I didn't know it was loaded.
I'm sorry.

42:58.375 --> 43:01.166
Sorry my ass. I almost died!

43:03.708 --> 43:05.250
There's a monster!

43:05.625 --> 43:07.291
There's a fucking monster upstairs!

43:07.458 --> 43:09.750
A monster?
Not a big rat?

43:10.083 --> 43:12.791
Of course it's a rat.
He's a wuss.

43:13.208 --> 43:15.791
-Did you see it?
-Not a thing.

43:15.958 --> 43:16.791
And me?

43:17.166 --> 43:18.708
I saw it.

43:18.875 --> 43:21.083
It had a big antelope head.

43:21.458 --> 43:24.208
Now you're all going to listen.

43:24.750 --> 43:27.000
Pack your bags
and we're leaving!

43:27.375 --> 43:28.250
Go.

43:28.708 --> 43:29.958
I'm going.

43:30.125 --> 43:30.875
Get out!

43:31.041 --> 43:32.791
I have to pack.

43:33.208 --> 43:34.291
I fuck you up.

43:34.791 --> 43:35.875
Stephan, stop.

43:36.125 --> 43:37.208
Fuck!

43:38.083 --> 43:39.500
Just stick together.

43:40.083 --> 43:41.708
No time to fight.

43:43.500 --> 43:45.208
Where are Drazik and Djamal?

43:45.500 --> 43:46.375
Here.

43:48.250 --> 43:49.291
Djamal?

43:50.333 --> 43:52.083
With me in the barn.

43:53.041 --> 43:54.333
If I'm not wrong.

43:54.500 --> 43:56.958
Why the hell is he in the barn?

44:06.333 --> 44:07.500
Fuck!

44:08.000 --> 44:09.333
Djamal's dead.

44:13.333 --> 44:14.125
I confirm.

44:15.791 --> 44:17.458
He's stiff as a board.

44:17.625 --> 44:19.250
It's not possible.

44:19.666 --> 44:22.291
First Kitty, now Djamal.

44:22.458 --> 44:25.583
We're going to die.
I don't want to die.

44:25.750 --> 44:28.208
We all agree,
an animal did it.

44:28.625 --> 44:32.166
Are you stupid?
An animal couldn't have hung

44:32.333 --> 44:33.750
his thing.

44:34.166 --> 44:36.708
What kind of freak does this?

44:36.875 --> 44:38.333
It's the monster.

44:38.500 --> 44:40.791
Doesn't matter who,
we have to go.

44:40.958 --> 44:42.916
Drazik, get Nadine:
to the bus.

45:15.916 --> 45:16.916
What's wrong?

45:19.500 --> 45:21.208
-Remember Djamal?
-Yes.

45:22.375 --> 45:23.625
He had a problem.

45:24.208 --> 45:25.166
What?

45:26.041 --> 45:27.416
This can't be real!

45:28.500 --> 45:30.083
We're shit out of luck.

45:31.333 --> 45:32.291
What's going on?

45:33.250 --> 45:34.416
Is it true?

45:36.083 --> 45:36.958
No.

45:41.250 --> 45:42.958
The bus. Where's the bus?

45:43.125 --> 45:44.375
It vanished, fuck.

45:44.541 --> 45:46.166
No. I have the keys.

45:46.333 --> 45:48.458
"I have the keys."
It's gone!

45:48.625 --> 45:50.458
No more bus, no network,

45:50.625 --> 45:52.458
perfect, great weekend.

45:52.625 --> 45:54.583
Stop yelling.
It's not her fault.

45:54.750 --> 45:56.250
She lost her dog.

45:56.416 --> 45:58.291
-I'm not yelling!
-Yes, you are.

45:58.458 --> 46:02.625
Fuck I'm not yelling!
We don't give a shit about her dog.

46:03.000 --> 46:04.291
You don't give a shit?

46:04.458 --> 46:05.458
I don't.

46:05.625 --> 46:07.041
And the head cutting psycho?

46:07.208 --> 46:10.375
-Get off me.
-I've had it. You're never happy.

46:10.541 --> 46:12.625
You don't dress up.
Always nagging.

46:12.791 --> 46:15.708
I don't want to see
your fuck face anymore.

46:16.125 --> 46:19.375
-Hold your woman!
-Be nice. Stephan!

46:27.875 --> 46:29.750
Why is a car watching us?

46:54.166 --> 46:57.541
<span style="style.default_1">Are you ready to die...</span>

47:00.625 --> 47:02.666
<span style="style.default_1">of pleasure!</span>

47:03.041 --> 47:04.375
Is that Enzo?

47:06.291 --> 47:07.458
It's Enzo!

47:08.375 --> 47:10.500
Clit, music.

47:27.791 --> 47:29.375
Happy to see the jerk.

47:36.708 --> 47:41.083
Did you guys really think
you'd spend New Year's without me?

47:42.375 --> 47:45.625
This is gonna be the best night
of your life.

47:46.041 --> 47:48.166
Cause starting now

47:48.333 --> 47:49.583
it's really...

47:56.166 --> 47:57.291
A damn nightmare.

47:58.041 --> 47:59.125
Help me!

48:01.416 --> 48:03.000
Clit, stop the sound.

48:03.750 --> 48:05.208
Go help him.

48:06.041 --> 48:09.000
What if there's more traps?
I'm staying here.

48:11.833 --> 48:13.250
I'm stuck!

48:13.583 --> 48:16.250
We can't leave him.
We need to get him.

48:16.416 --> 48:19.083
I can't carry him alone.
Who's coming?

48:20.625 --> 48:21.666
-Stephan?
-What?

48:21.833 --> 48:25.083
-Get the flashlight.
-No. He's your friend.

48:25.250 --> 48:27.041
-Loser.
-Loser yourself.

48:27.208 --> 48:27.833
Drazik?

48:29.833 --> 48:30.708
Yes?

48:30.875 --> 48:32.333
No.
Bruno, with me.

48:32.500 --> 48:34.708
What? Please, no.

48:35.041 --> 48:35.875
Not cool.

48:36.041 --> 48:38.791
You know I can't stand
the sight of blood.

48:38.958 --> 48:41.250
-So what do we do?
-Ask someone else.

48:42.250 --> 48:45.125
Bruno, you can do it.
I believe in you.

48:45.291 --> 48:47.541
We believe in you.
Okay?

48:48.083 --> 48:49.416
-Go!
-I can do it.

48:49.583 --> 48:50.875
Yes, you can.

48:51.041 --> 48:52.541
Just fucking go!

48:52.708 --> 48:54.250
Okay. I can do it.

48:54.416 --> 48:55.458
Go, Bruno.

48:55.708 --> 48:56.916
I'm gonna do it!

48:59.125 --> 49:00.541
Go!

49:03.083 --> 49:04.875
I can't. I'm not doing it.

49:05.041 --> 49:06.250
No, stay with me.

49:07.333 --> 49:08.416
Fuck.

49:08.791 --> 49:11.291
It's okay. Slowly.

49:11.500 --> 49:13.500
-Your hand.
-Moving forward.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.291
Flash me! Come on.

49:17.500 --> 49:18.541
Why did I say that?

49:19.000 --> 49:21.916
Why did I say I'll go?
I'm a piece of shit.

49:22.083 --> 49:23.916
I'm a piece of shit.

49:24.208 --> 49:26.250
That's a big one.
Go. Move on.

49:26.458 --> 49:28.208
-It hurts.
-Sorry.

49:32.083 --> 49:33.375
-Be careful.
-I know.

49:33.541 --> 49:35.083
Look. Be careful.

49:36.000 --> 49:36.875
Enzo?

49:38.666 --> 49:40.541
-Look.
-Put the flash away!

49:40.791 --> 49:42.625
-Sorry.
-Not on the blood!

49:44.875 --> 49:45.541
Calm down.

49:45.708 --> 49:48.458
We're going to try
to take the trap off.

49:50.000 --> 49:51.458
On my go, move your legs.

49:53.250 --> 49:53.958
-Okay?
-Yes.

49:54.708 --> 49:56.083
Do you understand?

49:56.250 --> 49:57.500
Moan twice.

49:58.250 --> 49:59.166
Fuck!

49:59.333 --> 50:02.291
-He moaned once, he didn't get it.
-Stop it.

50:02.458 --> 50:03.583
Hurry up!

50:03.958 --> 50:06.125
-We need to be in synch.
-Fuck!

50:09.166 --> 50:11.041
-Not looking.
-Eyes shut.

50:11.208 --> 50:13.875
My eyes are closed.

50:14.041 --> 50:15.500
I'm taking it. Okay.

50:15.666 --> 50:18.083
I grab the trap. I hold the trap.

50:18.458 --> 50:19.833
-Eyes shut.
-Go.

50:20.000 --> 50:20.750
We pull?

50:20.916 --> 50:22.041
Pull.

50:23.000 --> 50:24.875
-Eyes shut.
-Eyes shut.

50:25.041 --> 50:26.208
-Pull.
-Pulling.

50:26.375 --> 50:27.916
Almost.
Almost Enzo.

50:28.083 --> 50:30.333
It's okay. Pull.
Shut your eyes.

50:30.500 --> 50:31.625
Eyes shut.

50:31.916 --> 50:32.833
Go!

50:37.333 --> 50:39.166
Motherfucker!

50:39.333 --> 50:41.083
What the fuck?
I said "eyes shut".

50:41.250 --> 50:42.083
You said "go".

50:42.250 --> 50:44.458
I thought it was for me,
not for him.

50:44.625 --> 50:46.333
Enzo, I'm so sorry.

50:46.500 --> 50:49.833
-I forgive you.
-I'm glad you're taking it well.

50:50.125 --> 50:51.750
We need your junkie kit.

50:51.916 --> 50:52.791
Okay.

50:53.791 --> 50:55.041
No! Wait!

50:55.208 --> 50:58.958
My mom's a pharmacist. I will be too.
I have everything we need.

50:59.125 --> 51:01.291
-Come on!
-Not this one.

51:02.041 --> 51:03.666
Fuck, I can't find it.

51:04.208 --> 51:05.791
Against the runs, who cares.

51:05.958 --> 51:06.750
Wait.

51:07.500 --> 51:08.791
I'll find something.

51:11.291 --> 51:12.916
A glass of water please.

51:19.583 --> 51:20.750
We have to wait.

51:22.041 --> 51:23.000
Dose it up!

51:23.166 --> 51:24.583
Yes!
Here, drink it.

51:25.833 --> 51:27.041
We need a sheet.

51:27.375 --> 51:28.916
I got tape for the blood.

51:29.083 --> 51:30.833
No, not that. So stupid!

51:31.375 --> 51:32.583
-Your underwear!
-No!

51:32.833 --> 51:33.458
No!

51:35.000 --> 51:36.541
Not my underwear.

51:36.708 --> 51:37.666
They're clean.

51:37.833 --> 51:38.875
Who cares!

51:39.041 --> 51:41.791
Take Thursday's
but not that one.

51:41.958 --> 51:43.375
Take the compress.

51:43.666 --> 51:44.916
Fabrice,

51:45.291 --> 51:48.625
did you get my sneakers?
They're gonna get wet.

51:50.083 --> 51:51.500
It's sentimental.

51:52.625 --> 51:54.458
I got many girls with them.

51:54.916 --> 51:55.916
-Fuck!
-What?

51:57.750 --> 52:00.125
I don't need them anymore.

52:01.041 --> 52:02.166
Hold tight.

52:02.583 --> 52:04.166
-Stephan?
-Yeah?

52:04.333 --> 52:05.291
They're yours.

52:06.125 --> 52:08.833
No. I...
We're not the same size.

52:09.041 --> 52:10.541
Not the same size.

52:10.708 --> 52:12.416
Put newspaper.

52:12.791 --> 52:14.416
Right, put newspaper.

52:14.833 --> 52:17.166
Even ski socks,
the thick ones.

52:17.333 --> 52:18.541
Yes. Ski socks.

52:18.708 --> 52:21.958
Your feet are cut inside.
Sorry, I can't.

52:22.125 --> 52:24.916
Get out. Leave me alone.
You're useless.

52:25.333 --> 52:26.291
There.

52:30.833 --> 52:32.000
What are you doing?

52:34.708 --> 52:35.791
The other leg.

52:38.625 --> 52:40.208
Okay. That's it.

52:40.875 --> 52:42.083
We have to bail.

52:42.250 --> 52:44.375
It's the only way.

52:44.541 --> 52:48.541
On foot even.
We'll find a house and call 911.

52:48.708 --> 52:50.708
Not without Charlotte.

52:51.375 --> 52:53.458
But you never abandon family!

52:53.708 --> 52:54.875
You shut it.

52:55.375 --> 52:56.916
This is bullshit.

52:57.083 --> 53:00.541
First, Charlotte's a distant cousin.

53:00.708 --> 53:02.291
Second,

53:02.458 --> 53:05.291
Djamal is dead.
Fuck! Wake up.

53:05.541 --> 53:06.916
What about Enzo?

53:07.083 --> 53:08.958
We can't leave him here.

53:11.375 --> 53:13.166
You seem interested, now.

53:13.333 --> 53:14.541
Don't start.

53:14.708 --> 53:15.666
Start what?

53:15.833 --> 53:16.875
Say what?

53:17.041 --> 53:21.416
I'm just saying
that you don't usually care.

53:21.583 --> 53:23.416
Really?
That's all you got?

53:23.583 --> 53:24.791
-Yes.
-That's it.

53:24.958 --> 53:26.375
-"Whore".
-Stop!

53:26.541 --> 53:28.416
Shut up!
I'll fuck him up!

53:28.583 --> 53:29.291
Calm down.

53:29.458 --> 53:31.291
That's all he's got to say!

53:31.625 --> 53:33.083
Everyone calm down.

53:35.125 --> 53:37.125
I owed Djamal 100 bucks.

53:46.541 --> 53:47.708
I'm a goner.

53:48.375 --> 53:50.166
Don't say that Enzo.

53:50.708 --> 53:53.958
You're gonna make it. Okay?
Just hang in there.

53:55.625 --> 53:56.583
I don't think.

53:58.041 --> 53:58.875
I know it.

53:59.875 --> 54:00.750
I can feel it.

54:01.208 --> 54:03.250
We'll get you to a hospital.

54:03.625 --> 54:06.875
You'll be good as new. Okay?

54:08.000 --> 54:10.708
They'll give you prosthetics.
After you practice.

54:11.375 --> 54:12.916
You'll do the Olympics.

54:13.291 --> 54:15.166
You'll get all the medals.

54:15.583 --> 54:16.958
Make loads of dough.

54:17.125 --> 54:18.250
Get married.

54:19.000 --> 54:20.416
Kill your wife.

54:20.583 --> 54:22.000
Like that dude...

54:22.458 --> 54:24.708
with no legs, killed his wife.

54:25.375 --> 54:26.208
Drazik!

54:26.958 --> 54:27.916
Out.

54:28.416 --> 54:29.750
You know that guy?

54:29.958 --> 54:30.791
Out.

54:31.250 --> 54:33.708
It's okay. He makes me laugh.

54:39.250 --> 54:40.875
-Ouch, fuck.
-Sorry.

54:42.125 --> 54:43.291
I'm not even scared.

54:45.125 --> 54:46.750
I'm too weak.

54:47.000 --> 54:48.833
I'm just gonna let go,

54:49.750 --> 54:51.375
surrounded by friends.

54:54.208 --> 54:55.458
Well...

54:55.791 --> 54:58.666
there is one thing I'd ask for, but...

54:59.333 --> 55:01.083
Go on. Ask all you want.

55:13.125 --> 55:15.166
-Seriously?
-Yes.

55:19.125 --> 55:20.333
What the fuck?

55:20.500 --> 55:22.208
Looking for the shoes.

55:22.375 --> 55:24.666
Who gives a fuck?

55:24.958 --> 55:26.916
Taking risks for that jerk.

55:28.166 --> 55:30.625
I see him put moves on Samantha.

55:31.125 --> 55:34.000
Stop it.
You're getting totally paranoid.

55:34.333 --> 55:37.458
Of what?
Am I the only one seeing clearly?

55:37.791 --> 55:41.708
Stop with your calm down.
"Guys, don't fret, calm down!"

55:41.875 --> 55:43.041
You don't exist.

55:43.208 --> 55:45.833
Who calms down like this?
No one.

55:46.000 --> 55:49.541
So I get worked up.
I'll leave with or without you.

55:49.708 --> 55:50.833
Stephan, wait.

55:51.208 --> 55:52.791
Stephan, wait.

55:55.500 --> 55:56.958
-Wait up.
-Shut up.

56:02.666 --> 56:05.041
Where are the damn keys?

56:12.166 --> 56:15.000
Stephan! Open.
I can see you in there.

56:19.875 --> 56:21.458
Why did you say "shut up"?

56:32.666 --> 56:34.500
What is all this?

57:08.958 --> 57:11.166
Beautiful, a woman undressing.

57:13.541 --> 57:14.750
This is messed up.

57:15.583 --> 57:17.125
It's his last request.

57:17.708 --> 57:19.791
Just dance and be sexy.

57:22.666 --> 57:26.000
What a sight
clothes sliding on skin.

57:29.000 --> 57:31.541
-No I can't!
-Don't wuss out.

57:32.000 --> 57:33.541
He's seen you naked.

57:33.708 --> 57:35.708
Just give him what he wants.

57:36.000 --> 57:40.000
Easy for you. You like girls.
With your short hair, I can tell.

57:40.166 --> 57:41.416
Whatever.

57:41.958 --> 57:44.000
Oh shit! That's tight!

57:44.583 --> 57:46.041
Doesn't move an inch,

57:46.208 --> 57:47.458
you work out?

57:48.750 --> 57:49.708
Talking about my ass?

57:51.000 --> 57:52.958
-You noticed?
-Absolutely.

57:53.125 --> 57:55.500
You look seventeen, it's so tight.

57:55.958 --> 57:57.333
Turn around some.

58:00.041 --> 58:02.041
Oh yes... There we go!

58:04.291 --> 58:05.291
Nadine?

58:09.166 --> 58:10.666
Can I ask you something?

58:12.458 --> 58:14.625
The dude's name that killed his wife?

58:14.791 --> 58:17.041
The one with spatulas instead of feet.

58:18.375 --> 58:19.250
I...

58:21.375 --> 58:24.541
Be kittens. Show me your feline side.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.333
Jess, be a cop,
do a take down.

58:39.625 --> 58:41.416
-You're under arrest.
-Yes!

58:41.583 --> 58:43.958
-You can remain silent.
-Yes!

58:44.125 --> 58:46.208
You can have an attorney.
Okay?

58:46.583 --> 58:47.583
Don't move!

58:47.833 --> 58:50.083
I can't really move anyways.

58:52.333 --> 58:54.458
Sam, you know what I'd like?

58:54.625 --> 58:55.791
Come on, Sam.

58:56.041 --> 58:56.916
Fuck.

59:00.541 --> 59:02.500
You pervert.

59:05.833 --> 59:06.958
Oh fuck!

59:09.791 --> 59:10.583
Fuck!

59:12.666 --> 59:13.458
I knew it.

59:34.250 --> 59:35.583
Small sausage.

59:36.000 --> 59:37.291
Papers and registration.

59:37.625 --> 59:39.708
I don't have them, he does.

59:40.083 --> 59:41.208
On the hood!

59:41.375 --> 59:44.083
We're 25 thousand feet in the air.

59:51.958 --> 59:52.875
Fuck!

59:54.500 --> 59:55.416
Stephan?

59:57.291 --> 59:58.291
Fuck!

01:00:08.625 --> 01:00:10.166
Fuck! Stephan, open!

01:00:26.291 --> 01:00:27.541
What happened here?

01:00:27.708 --> 01:00:30.958
I got bit by a fucking snake.
Can't you tell?

01:00:31.125 --> 01:00:32.041
Yeah.

01:00:32.208 --> 01:00:35.333
Not really, you're just...
a bit swollen up.

01:00:35.708 --> 01:00:36.625
Okay.

01:00:37.333 --> 01:00:39.083
I'm gonna kill Enzo,
I'll be back.

01:00:42.416 --> 01:00:43.833
Kill Enzo?

01:00:44.583 --> 01:00:46.291
What? Stephan!

01:00:46.583 --> 01:00:48.291
I never drink on the job.

01:00:48.458 --> 01:00:51.250
I had a puff on an e-cig
in the toilets.

01:00:51.666 --> 01:00:55.000
Shut up or I'll smash your face
on the wall.

01:00:55.708 --> 01:00:58.500
-Here's some oxygen.
-Make love to me.

01:01:01.875 --> 01:01:02.750
Stephan?

01:01:09.416 --> 01:01:10.125
I knew it.

01:01:12.041 --> 01:01:13.125
I knew it!

01:01:15.333 --> 01:01:17.583
I'm your executioner.

01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:19.500
I'm going to kill you.

01:01:19.666 --> 01:01:22.041
Stop!
It's the venom talking.

01:01:24.083 --> 01:01:25.208
Stop!

01:01:26.875 --> 01:01:28.375
Calm down.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.250
Come, baby.
You'll be safe with me.

01:01:33.833 --> 01:01:36.500
You're insane! You just killed him.

01:01:36.666 --> 01:01:38.458
That's why I left you, freak!

01:01:38.625 --> 01:01:40.166
You didn't leave me!

01:01:40.750 --> 01:01:41.916
We're on a break!

01:01:43.666 --> 01:01:44.958
So come here now.

01:01:45.125 --> 01:01:46.291
Get out, freak!

01:01:46.458 --> 01:01:47.875
Move, dyke!

01:01:57.125 --> 01:02:00.291
Don't ever talk to Jess like that!

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.250
Get it in your head,

01:02:03.416 --> 01:02:06.000
with Sam, it's over!

01:02:07.083 --> 01:02:10.958
She can fuck whoever she wants.
And she is.

01:02:12.416 --> 01:02:14.416
They come on her!

01:02:14.791 --> 01:02:16.500
We got it, Bruno.

01:02:18.583 --> 01:02:20.375
Ten years giving me shit.

01:02:20.541 --> 01:02:21.916
Treating me like shit.

01:02:22.583 --> 01:02:24.291
Only my mom can!

01:02:24.708 --> 01:02:27.000
That's it. Just my mom!

01:02:30.166 --> 01:02:32.000
You deserve to get peed on.

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:34.333
I'm going to.

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:35.541
Stop!

01:02:36.333 --> 01:02:38.416
-Bruno, it's useless!
-Fine.

01:02:38.583 --> 01:02:39.791
-Stop.
-Okay.

01:02:39.958 --> 01:02:40.791
Stop. Come on.

01:02:40.958 --> 01:02:42.416
-Just a little.
-Stop it!

01:02:42.583 --> 01:02:44.541
-I won't do it.
-Stop it!

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:54.000
What's this?
What's going on?

01:02:55.041 --> 01:02:56.916
How could you? To your friends?

01:02:57.083 --> 01:02:59.125
To Enzo? To Djamal?

01:02:59.833 --> 01:03:02.583
You're crazy! It's not me!

01:03:03.083 --> 01:03:03.916
Listen, Stephan,

01:03:05.250 --> 01:03:06.666
we took a vote,

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.208
I'm going to pee on you.

01:03:10.375 --> 01:03:12.041
Stop with your pee!

01:03:12.583 --> 01:03:15.541
You've always been jealous of them.
You're hopeless.

01:03:16.333 --> 01:03:18.208
But it's not me!

01:03:18.541 --> 01:03:19.833
Baby, say something.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.416
You're a sick man.

01:03:21.708 --> 01:03:22.833
Fabrice!

01:03:23.666 --> 01:03:24.500
It's not me!

01:03:24.708 --> 01:03:26.250
You've changed.

01:03:26.625 --> 01:03:27.791
I don't know you.

01:03:32.291 --> 01:03:33.333
Come back here!

01:03:33.958 --> 01:03:35.916
Come back! It's not me!

01:03:36.208 --> 01:03:37.416
Please.

01:03:38.666 --> 01:03:40.583
A cigarette! Someone, please!

01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:49.000
By chance, do you know the name
of the guy who killed his wife?

01:03:49.166 --> 01:03:51.000
The guy with the wooden leg?

01:03:52.083 --> 01:03:53.416
The South African?

01:03:53.666 --> 01:03:55.625
I don't give a fucking shit!

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:57.583
Fuck!

01:04:00.041 --> 01:04:02.833
A light.
A light! Drazik?

01:04:03.166 --> 01:04:04.375
Drazik, a light!

01:04:08.416 --> 01:04:10.958
Charlotte!
You're fucking alive!

01:04:12.583 --> 01:04:13.958
Alive, I don't know.

01:04:14.541 --> 01:04:16.291
What happened?

01:04:16.458 --> 01:04:18.000
Let me take care of her.

01:04:18.875 --> 01:04:20.666
I got her right away.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.750
I'll approach slowly.

01:04:26.625 --> 01:04:27.958
Gently.

01:04:28.166 --> 01:04:29.166
Don't move.

01:04:35.375 --> 01:04:36.250
Stop.

01:04:38.416 --> 01:04:39.750
Charlotte?

01:04:41.333 --> 01:04:43.666
Sweetie, do you recognize me?

01:04:49.083 --> 01:04:50.125
My deposit!

01:04:50.916 --> 01:04:53.375
My aunt's going to kill me!

01:04:53.541 --> 01:04:55.791
She's allowed to pee!
She's perfect.

01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:07.500
<span style="style.default_1">Nunctus Sanctus Day. Vade retro satana!</span>

01:05:07.666 --> 01:05:09.375
Are you stupid or what?

01:05:09.541 --> 01:05:11.083
I don't know. Never know.

01:05:14.625 --> 01:05:16.291
Dilated pupil.

01:05:18.500 --> 01:05:19.958
Urine leakage.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.458
Sweaty earlobe.

01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:26.458
Little rascal nose.

01:05:28.083 --> 01:05:30.666
Looks like cupcake poisoning.

01:05:30.833 --> 01:05:32.541
What cupcake?

01:05:33.083 --> 01:05:36.708
The Mexican ones she ate earlier.
Three mushrooms.

01:05:37.083 --> 01:05:38.208
Did you eat some?

01:05:38.375 --> 01:05:40.791
You let her eat the cupcakes?

01:05:40.958 --> 01:05:42.375
I can make more.
Takes only 15 mins.

01:05:42.541 --> 01:05:44.541
Are you fucking stupid?

01:05:44.708 --> 01:05:45.708
Stop!

01:05:48.625 --> 01:05:50.416
It took 20 minutes
for the dough.

01:05:50.583 --> 01:05:52.083
Stop!

01:05:52.583 --> 01:05:54.125
It's useless.

01:05:54.291 --> 01:05:55.958
We found Charlotte.

01:05:56.125 --> 01:05:57.875
Let's find a way out of here.

01:05:58.041 --> 01:06:01.541
The worst night of my life.
I'll be in my room.

01:06:08.416 --> 01:06:12.166
Earlier with Jess in the attic
I had a bar.

01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:18.291
It didn't stay long but we can try.

01:06:18.458 --> 01:06:20.000
To get a signal

01:06:20.166 --> 01:06:21.416
and call for help. Okay?

01:06:21.583 --> 01:06:22.416
Let's go.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.416
-I'm coming.
-No.

01:06:24.833 --> 01:06:26.125
Why not?

01:06:29.041 --> 01:06:31.208
It's not a good idea.

01:06:31.958 --> 01:06:35.000
It can be dangerous.
It's best I go alone.

01:06:36.958 --> 01:06:38.041
Good job.

01:06:42.208 --> 01:06:44.250
You know what I'll do
when you get back?

01:06:44.416 --> 01:06:45.291
Tell me.

01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:47.750
Lentils with salted pork.

01:06:48.583 --> 01:06:49.875
I love that.

01:06:51.250 --> 01:06:52.416
Incredible.

01:06:54.666 --> 01:06:56.875
Come on. Go!

01:06:57.041 --> 01:06:58.000
I'm going.

01:06:58.166 --> 01:06:59.416
My hero!

01:07:01.708 --> 01:07:02.625
Go!

01:07:02.916 --> 01:07:04.083
Drazik, let's go.

01:07:06.625 --> 01:07:08.041
I have other plans.

01:07:12.208 --> 01:07:14.791
Don't worry, babe,
we're okay now.

01:07:14.958 --> 01:07:16.458
The wild boars.

01:07:16.750 --> 01:07:19.833
-What about them?
-They know.

01:07:20.666 --> 01:07:23.458
No, honey, they're in the woods.

01:07:24.125 --> 01:07:27.583
Stephan's the mean guy.
He can't hurt us anymore.

01:07:28.333 --> 01:07:29.958
It's not Stephan.

01:07:30.666 --> 01:07:32.666
Yes, it is.

01:07:32.833 --> 01:07:33.916
No.

01:07:34.833 --> 01:07:37.708
And you're not a saint.
You're a slut.

01:07:38.708 --> 01:07:41.291
Watch out!
I didn't talk shit, bitch!

01:07:42.666 --> 01:07:45.541
I'm losing my head
with all of this.

01:07:45.708 --> 01:07:49.000
Sorry, sweetie.
I don't know what got into me.

01:09:18.332 --> 01:09:21.457
Bad luck! I work out.
I'll smash your head.

01:10:06.333 --> 01:10:07.666
Move, bitch!

01:10:49.291 --> 01:10:50.250
Got something?

01:10:51.166 --> 01:10:52.458
No. Nothing.

01:10:54.041 --> 01:10:55.291
Damn it!

01:11:03.875 --> 01:11:04.916
Hello?

01:11:05.333 --> 01:11:06.583
Mom?

01:11:08.166 --> 01:11:09.416
You're calling your mom?

01:11:12.041 --> 01:11:13.916
He's in the house.

01:11:15.458 --> 01:11:18.125
He killed Jess.
Charlotte too I think.

01:11:18.416 --> 01:11:20.833
I tried to save her
but I couldn't.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:21.708
Fuck!

01:11:25.458 --> 01:11:26.875
Fuck!

01:11:27.208 --> 01:11:30.000
The only girl that smiles at me

01:11:30.625 --> 01:11:31.583
in 5 years

01:11:32.250 --> 01:11:33.416
has to go!

01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:37.791
Damn it!

01:11:38.208 --> 01:11:41.208
I'll never know the joy of sex!

01:11:50.083 --> 01:11:51.375
Where's Nadine?

01:11:52.166 --> 01:11:54.291
I didn't see her.
I hope in her room.

01:11:54.458 --> 01:11:56.958
-We need to get her now.
-No.

01:11:57.916 --> 01:11:59.625
We need equipment first.

01:12:01.791 --> 01:12:03.125
Look. Three bars.

01:12:03.333 --> 01:12:04.250
I can't believe it!

01:12:09.708 --> 01:12:10.666
No network needed.

01:12:12.291 --> 01:12:14.041
This is between us.

01:12:16.875 --> 01:12:17.958
Nadine?

01:12:45.791 --> 01:12:47.791
-Fuck, Drazik?
-Hey!

01:12:48.125 --> 01:12:48.916
Where were you?

01:12:49.125 --> 01:12:51.666
Taking a shit and...

01:12:53.833 --> 01:12:54.916
Have a look.

01:13:08.208 --> 01:13:09.250
Nadine?

01:13:16.916 --> 01:13:18.875
What's this maze?

01:13:20.333 --> 01:13:22.625
It covers all the house.

01:13:23.708 --> 01:13:25.333
Like a...

01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:27.791
parallel network.
-Exactly.

01:13:28.916 --> 01:13:31.041
We're going around in circles.

01:13:32.375 --> 01:13:33.583
I have an idea.

01:13:34.333 --> 01:13:38.791
We could leave pebbles all around.

01:13:39.708 --> 01:13:40.458
Yeah.

01:13:40.916 --> 01:13:42.625
You have pebbles?

01:13:43.291 --> 01:13:44.958
No, I admit.

01:13:46.166 --> 01:13:48.291
This is how the killer
moves around.

01:13:48.791 --> 01:13:50.875
I think so too.

01:13:52.208 --> 01:13:53.416
But this time,

01:13:53.916 --> 01:13:55.583
I get his plan.

01:13:58.166 --> 01:13:59.208
Which means?

01:14:02.583 --> 01:14:04.958
We'll beat him at his own game.

01:14:05.791 --> 01:14:06.916
Which means?

01:14:08.916 --> 01:14:11.125
-I just told you.
-I don't get it.

01:14:11.291 --> 01:14:14.041
We'll beat him at his own game.
Follow me.

01:14:17.208 --> 01:14:18.750
Or else, yes, fuck,

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:23.333
little pieces of weed. Like this.

01:14:24.333 --> 01:14:26.208
Yeah, good idea. Do that.

01:14:29.666 --> 01:14:31.500
You're right, stupid idea.

01:14:32.208 --> 01:14:33.500
Stupid idea.

01:14:36.375 --> 01:14:37.500
This way.

01:14:54.583 --> 01:14:56.041
No!

01:14:57.250 --> 01:14:59.375
The look of the room!

01:15:07.250 --> 01:15:08.583
It's like

01:15:09.041 --> 01:15:10.291
a secret room.

01:15:16.583 --> 01:15:18.250
You think the killer sleeps here?

01:15:21.083 --> 01:15:23.208
I'm staying with my first idea.

01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:24.708
Which was?

01:15:25.708 --> 01:15:26.416
An otter.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.958
I'm sorry but it all fits.

01:15:30.291 --> 01:15:31.750
Little by little,

01:15:31.916 --> 01:15:33.625
the noose is tightening.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.875
This thing again.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.125
You know what taxidermy is?

01:15:46.583 --> 01:15:47.416
Look!

01:15:48.208 --> 01:15:50.958
It's the mansion.
I recognize the doors.

01:15:52.041 --> 01:15:53.916
It must be the Baron.

01:15:56.125 --> 01:15:58.500
Don't these kids look familiar?

01:16:08.458 --> 01:16:10.500
Man, I can't.

01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:12.000
-What?
-I can't.

01:16:12.791 --> 01:16:14.625
You okay?
What's wrong?

01:16:14.791 --> 01:16:16.166
Where's Nadine?

01:16:16.416 --> 01:16:18.000
We'll find her.

01:16:18.166 --> 01:16:21.458
-Fuck.
-Don't worry. You trust me?

01:16:23.208 --> 01:16:25.583
-No.
-I promise we'll find her.

01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:26.541
We're four.

01:16:26.708 --> 01:16:28.916
Nothing can happen as long as...

01:16:30.625 --> 01:16:32.166
Where are they?

01:16:32.333 --> 01:16:33.416
Where are they?

01:16:36.541 --> 01:16:37.708
Fuck!

01:16:45.125 --> 01:16:47.125
Okay.
He's alone. We're two.

01:16:48.791 --> 01:16:51.041
I'll take care of it.
I'll handle it.

01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:13.583
I'll kill you.

01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:15.708
I got you, Stephan!

01:17:16.375 --> 01:17:17.208
Nadine?

01:17:18.583 --> 01:17:20.000
No! Mom!

01:17:27.833 --> 01:17:28.666
Mom!

01:17:37.875 --> 01:17:39.333
You know I hate doing this.

01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:41.208
I lost control.

01:17:41.583 --> 01:17:43.083
I didn't think he'd be so tough.

01:17:46.458 --> 01:17:47.625
Doesn't matter.

01:17:48.666 --> 01:17:49.833
One more down.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.791
We're almost finished.
I'll massage you after.

01:17:56.666 --> 01:17:57.583
Shut up!

01:18:06.541 --> 01:18:08.666
Maybe the Baron's the killer?

01:18:10.583 --> 01:18:12.625
The guy has died since then.

01:18:13.708 --> 01:18:16.250
Maybe it's the kids.

01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:18.500
He passed them the vice.

01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:22.791
A bad omen

01:18:23.958 --> 01:18:25.458
but heavy is the crown.

01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:29.958
No jokes. This kind of thing.

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.208
See that?

01:18:36.166 --> 01:18:37.666
It's written

01:18:38.125 --> 01:18:40.166
"Nardine and Patrice."

01:18:41.958 --> 01:18:45.333
-Know any Nardine and Patrice?
-No.

01:18:47.083 --> 01:18:48.333
Unless.

01:18:51.791 --> 01:18:53.750
It says in braille,

01:18:55.125 --> 01:18:56.500
"Don't touch."

01:18:58.083 --> 01:18:59.166
I'm joking.

01:18:59.333 --> 01:19:01.625
It's says "Nadine and Fabrice."

01:19:05.083 --> 01:19:06.208
Nadine

01:19:06.625 --> 01:19:07.791
and Fabrice?

01:19:25.208 --> 01:19:26.166
What you doing?

01:19:27.083 --> 01:19:29.458
How can you fucking smoke now!

01:19:36.291 --> 01:19:37.500
I don't know.

01:19:39.416 --> 01:19:40.666
Maybe in 5 minutes,

01:19:41.708 --> 01:19:42.916
I won't be able to anymore.

01:20:02.166 --> 01:20:05.458
Someone came in the room.
I can feel it.

01:20:35.666 --> 01:20:36.375
Pistorius.

01:20:37.083 --> 01:20:39.041
Fuck. Oscar Pistorius!

01:20:40.333 --> 01:20:41.833
The guy who killed his wife.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:44.291
It was on the tip of my tongue.

01:20:44.458 --> 01:20:45.333
That feels good.

01:20:49.208 --> 01:20:50.208
Good evening!

01:21:12.208 --> 01:21:13.500
Fellow friends,

01:21:13.916 --> 01:21:17.708
this is the best New Year's
of my life!

01:21:17.916 --> 01:21:19.041
And that's

01:21:22.208 --> 01:21:23.541
thanks to you.

01:21:24.333 --> 01:21:25.166
Thank you.

01:21:25.583 --> 01:21:28.083
What are you doing?
You're crazy!

01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:29.250
Crazy?

01:21:29.625 --> 01:21:30.625
No.

01:21:30.958 --> 01:21:33.000
Fabrice loves you guys so much.

01:21:33.375 --> 01:21:35.666
I help to keep his loved ones.

01:21:36.875 --> 01:21:39.041
You don't know how lucky you are.

01:21:41.375 --> 01:21:42.583
But you,

01:21:42.750 --> 01:21:46.000
you can't hurt us,
I thought we were family.

01:21:46.583 --> 01:21:47.750
Exactly.

01:21:48.291 --> 01:21:50.333
A family stays united.

01:21:51.125 --> 01:21:53.125
We don't leave each other.

01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:57.250
I like my family close to me.

01:21:57.416 --> 01:21:58.708
Like for example,

01:21:58.958 --> 01:22:00.375
my little sister.

01:22:01.333 --> 01:22:03.958
You're brother and sister.
Disgusting!

01:22:06.291 --> 01:22:07.291
On the contrary.

01:22:07.458 --> 01:22:09.208
You should see us have sex.

01:22:09.791 --> 01:22:11.291
There's nothing better.

01:22:12.291 --> 01:22:13.791
69.

01:22:13.958 --> 01:22:15.208
The Amazon.

01:22:15.375 --> 01:22:16.750
Tomoe Nage.

01:22:17.083 --> 01:22:18.416
The pink marker.

01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:21.083
The Koala

01:22:21.333 --> 01:22:22.375
on the log.

01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:25.583
You know I'm open-minded,

01:22:26.083 --> 01:22:27.750
but it's dirty.
Really filthy.

01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:31.125
We created the perfect couple.

01:22:31.708 --> 01:22:34.791
Bound by heart and blood.

01:22:37.750 --> 01:22:38.708
Blood.

01:22:43.916 --> 01:22:45.708
Our parents enjoyed having fun.

01:22:47.166 --> 01:22:48.291
They loved to party.

01:22:49.250 --> 01:22:50.625
A little too much.

01:22:52.250 --> 01:22:53.458
Let's go!

01:23:10.791 --> 01:23:12.041
Time to sleep, kids!

01:23:12.666 --> 01:23:16.916
Sweet dreams.
Blandine, take care of your brother.

01:23:17.083 --> 01:23:18.041
Nadine!

01:23:18.208 --> 01:23:19.458
Yeah, if you want.

01:23:19.625 --> 01:23:20.833
Go!

01:23:22.166 --> 01:23:23.166
Don't worry.

01:23:23.333 --> 01:23:24.750
We'll be back later.

01:23:30.833 --> 01:23:31.833
Go!

01:23:32.333 --> 01:23:34.125
Come on!

01:23:42.541 --> 01:23:44.666
They never came back.

01:23:45.375 --> 01:23:48.750
We stayed three nights alone
in the fucking forest.

01:23:49.791 --> 01:23:52.708
I promised no one
would ever abandon us.

01:23:54.625 --> 01:23:59.000
Baron Gluckenstein Muller
took us in his mansion.

01:23:59.333 --> 01:24:01.916
Didier was a brilliant man,

01:24:02.291 --> 01:24:06.458
a fearsome hunter, animal lover,
an outstanding taxidermist.

01:24:07.291 --> 01:24:08.833
By stuffing animals,

01:24:09.416 --> 01:24:10.916
he made them eternal.

01:24:11.083 --> 01:24:13.375
So that's taxidermy!

01:24:13.541 --> 01:24:15.125
I just followed what I learned

01:24:15.291 --> 01:24:16.791
on my loved ones.

01:24:16.958 --> 01:24:20.000
And I started my collection.

01:24:20.791 --> 01:24:22.208
Consuella,

01:24:22.458 --> 01:24:23.875
our housekeeper.

01:24:24.791 --> 01:24:27.583
She discovered our activities.

01:24:27.750 --> 01:24:29.583
Bad Consu!

01:24:29.958 --> 01:24:30.833
Jean-Luc,

01:24:31.083 --> 01:24:33.291
our ski instructor.

01:24:33.458 --> 01:24:36.500
He left before my bunny's first star.

01:24:38.291 --> 01:24:40.958
Look, babe. My first one.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:42.833
Flake.

01:24:43.333 --> 01:24:45.041
So adorable.

01:24:45.291 --> 01:24:48.291
He kept running away.
So did Kitty.

01:24:49.541 --> 01:24:50.833
But she's so cute.

01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:55.708
And now,
the rough diamond of my collection.

01:24:58.208 --> 01:24:59.375
Willy Denzey.

01:25:00.208 --> 01:25:01.458
Willy D.

01:25:01.791 --> 01:25:03.041
King Will.

01:25:03.208 --> 01:25:05.541
The Dens WD pounds.

01:25:07.416 --> 01:25:09.750
When he announced putting
his career on standby,

01:25:09.916 --> 01:25:11.833
Fabrice fell apart.

01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:16.083
I see Mr. Calotte, my therapist.

01:25:16.958 --> 01:25:19.875
Mrs. Prunelle, my therapist.

01:25:20.666 --> 01:25:22.500
And little Charlotte,

01:25:22.916 --> 01:25:24.750
my first love.

01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:27.125
Don't say her name.

01:25:27.750 --> 01:25:29.375
And so many more,

01:25:29.958 --> 01:25:31.666
united here

01:25:32.125 --> 01:25:33.541
for eternity.

01:25:34.458 --> 01:25:35.833
Why do this?

01:25:42.458 --> 01:25:43.500
It's simple.

01:25:43.666 --> 01:25:46.291
I'm killing you because I love you.

01:25:47.666 --> 01:25:49.333
We love you too.

01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:50.958
We'll never leave you.

01:25:51.125 --> 01:25:52.166
Liar!

01:25:52.625 --> 01:25:54.375
You want to be a stewardess.

01:25:54.541 --> 01:25:58.250
So ready to die
or do you need a makeover first?

01:25:58.416 --> 01:26:02.958
Crew chief. No make over.
I'm a natural beauty, unlike you!

01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:06.500
I'm going to kill the bitch!

01:26:07.333 --> 01:26:08.541
Calm down, girls.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.458
Be sweet with name calling.

01:26:11.625 --> 01:26:13.500
Not here. Remember

01:26:13.666 --> 01:26:16.250
we're here to party.

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:44.166
Samantha!

01:26:44.583 --> 01:26:45.541
Stephan?

01:26:47.333 --> 01:26:49.083
Stephan? Here.
Come save me.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.166
Samantha!

01:27:03.250 --> 01:27:05.833
Why are you smiling?

01:27:07.208 --> 01:27:08.500
What are you doing?

01:27:08.791 --> 01:27:10.833
Free family first!

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:12.166
Wait your turn, okay!

01:27:15.208 --> 01:27:18.166
I'm sorry about the cupcakes.
I had a heavy hand.

01:27:18.541 --> 01:27:20.916
Not enough fudge.
I missed my frosting.

01:27:21.083 --> 01:27:23.541
Don't apologize.
It made me feel good.

01:27:23.708 --> 01:27:25.666
It opened doors.

01:27:26.125 --> 01:27:27.583
It's like there was a barrier...

01:27:31.708 --> 01:27:33.125
I feel alive.

01:27:33.291 --> 01:27:36.125
I have an idea!
My pocket. The Zippo.

01:27:39.333 --> 01:27:41.416
That's Pauline.
The other pocket.

01:27:45.291 --> 01:27:46.500
Yes, for the rope!

01:27:46.833 --> 01:27:49.083
Good idea.
Yeah.

01:27:49.250 --> 01:27:50.250
Here you are.

01:27:52.250 --> 01:27:54.166
I'm going to kill you!

01:27:56.666 --> 01:27:58.333
Come on, baby!
Kill him!

01:27:58.500 --> 01:28:00.833
Kick his motherfucking ass!

01:28:01.291 --> 01:28:02.875
Fuck him up! Bastard!

01:28:03.041 --> 01:28:05.291
They're fucking taxidermists!

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:14.958
Here, whore.
You'll be able to join your lovers.

01:28:15.916 --> 01:28:16.583
Join your...

01:28:18.875 --> 01:28:19.583
Samantha!

01:28:32.041 --> 01:28:34.125
You killed her!
You killed Sam!

01:28:34.291 --> 01:28:37.125
Don't worry.
She loved getting poked.

01:28:51.291 --> 01:28:52.708
Wait!

01:28:52.958 --> 01:28:54.583
Stop, Stephan!

01:28:54.750 --> 01:28:55.958
We did all this

01:28:56.125 --> 01:28:58.541
cause you're our friends.
We love you.

01:28:58.791 --> 01:29:01.833
Especially you, Stephan.
You're my favorite.

01:29:07.416 --> 01:29:10.416
Stop or I will rip off
your small dick.

01:29:13.583 --> 01:29:15.583
Fucking stop, I said.

01:29:16.250 --> 01:29:16.916
I hate you!

01:29:21.583 --> 01:29:24.083
Go to hell.
You and your fucking weekend.

01:29:24.583 --> 01:29:25.208
No...

01:29:34.125 --> 01:29:35.583
Baby? Sam?

01:29:37.166 --> 01:29:38.166
I'm sorry, love.

01:29:38.708 --> 01:29:40.333
I couldn't save you.

01:29:41.791 --> 01:29:44.708
It's okay, baby. I'm sorry.

01:29:45.208 --> 01:29:47.375
I should've been more honest.

01:29:47.541 --> 01:29:49.750
I should've told you before.

01:29:50.333 --> 01:29:52.666
I forgive you.

01:29:53.125 --> 01:29:55.958
Who cares if you cheated,
I love you.

01:29:58.875 --> 01:30:00.958
I slept with Enzo.

01:30:01.125 --> 01:30:03.791
I know. It doesn't matter.

01:30:05.625 --> 01:30:09.250
I also blew Djamal a bit,

01:30:09.416 --> 01:30:11.583
to help for an audition.

01:30:11.833 --> 01:30:13.708
He was a good guy.

01:30:15.833 --> 01:30:18.500
I slept with Drazik too.

01:30:20.083 --> 01:30:21.083
What?

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.125
Yes.

01:30:24.958 --> 01:30:28.625
The beach, warm sand,
Bossa Nova.

01:30:30.041 --> 01:30:31.250
That was you?

01:30:31.416 --> 01:30:33.958
-Hey, sorry man.
-It's okay.

01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:39.000
As long as you didn't have sex
with Bruno.

01:30:39.833 --> 01:30:40.791
No.

01:30:41.708 --> 01:30:44.041
I didn't have sex with Bruno,

01:30:44.208 --> 01:30:46.125
just a hand job.

01:30:56.416 --> 01:30:58.583
<span style="style.default_1">It's time for the Last Judgement</span>

01:30:58.750 --> 01:31:01.958
<span style="style.default_1">I'm going to saw you in two</span>

01:31:02.333 --> 01:31:04.666
Calm down, Fabrice.

01:31:04.833 --> 01:31:07.625
Stop before it gets out of control.

01:31:09.208 --> 01:31:12.958
<span style="style.default_1">You know me</span>
<span style="style.default_1">I'm a fucking crazy</span>

01:31:13.125 --> 01:31:14.000
Open the door.

01:31:14.166 --> 01:31:16.125
-What?
-Open the door.

01:31:16.375 --> 01:31:18.125
<span style="style.default_1">Man, I'll stuff you</span>

01:31:18.291 --> 01:31:21.166
<span style="style.default_1">You know how it goes</span>

01:31:21.333 --> 01:31:23.541
<span style="style.default_1">I'll open your body</span>
<span style="style.default_1">Take out the heart</span>

01:31:23.708 --> 01:31:26.208
<span style="style.default_1">And your oesophagus too</span>

01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:32.625
Have a good trip, man.

01:31:50.250 --> 01:31:51.083
Anyone there?

01:31:58.916 --> 01:31:59.875
Hey, you guys!

01:32:06.208 --> 01:32:07.166
You're beautiful.

01:32:07.333 --> 01:32:09.541
I don't want Miss Slut near me.

01:32:09.708 --> 01:32:11.083
I can't help you.

01:32:11.250 --> 01:32:13.958
I agree. Put me next to a real man.

01:32:14.125 --> 01:32:15.708
I'm not just a dick!

01:32:15.875 --> 01:32:19.500
Tell my mom I love her.
Not like a son.

01:32:19.666 --> 01:32:22.166
-I love her like my wife.
-Will do.

01:32:22.333 --> 01:32:25.041
Keep the shoes.
Too big for Stephan.

01:32:25.208 --> 01:32:26.541
Shh! I'm ovulating.

01:32:27.083 --> 01:32:28.416
Great!

01:32:28.583 --> 01:32:29.791
Do something please.

01:32:29.958 --> 01:32:33.333
Help me first.
Don't forget I've never had sex.

01:32:34.125 --> 01:32:35.583
Not all at once!

01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:38.250
Tell Samantha I love her.

01:32:38.583 --> 01:32:41.208
Be a man, Fabrice.
Have some balls!

01:32:41.375 --> 01:32:45.166
Get my legs outside, please.
You just need to glue them.

01:32:45.333 --> 01:32:48.041
Stop it! Please! Calm down.

01:32:49.583 --> 01:32:51.750
Please, calm down.

01:32:52.125 --> 01:32:53.041
I need to fuck!

01:32:54.833 --> 01:32:56.333
Stop with that shit!

01:33:00.125 --> 01:33:01.625
Sorry to bother you.

01:33:01.791 --> 01:33:03.000
Seen Pauline?

01:33:03.708 --> 01:33:05.083
A little frog

01:33:05.250 --> 01:33:06.416
big like this.

01:33:07.875 --> 01:33:08.625
No.

01:33:09.833 --> 01:33:10.666
Okay.

01:33:26.125 --> 01:33:27.416
Willy, is that you?

01:33:27.875 --> 01:33:29.041
Fabrice,

01:33:30.458 --> 01:33:31.583
you screwed up, man.

01:33:31.916 --> 01:33:34.625
Friendship is sacred.
You didn't respect that.

01:33:35.708 --> 01:33:37.083
Yeah, you're right.

01:33:37.333 --> 01:33:39.125
I'm placing myself.

01:33:39.916 --> 01:33:41.208
Efficient.

01:33:41.583 --> 01:33:43.708
<span style="style.default_1">Follow my lead</span>

01:33:50.625 --> 01:33:51.791
Stephan?

01:33:55.083 --> 01:33:56.791
Leave without me.
Let me die.

01:33:57.708 --> 01:33:58.375
The venom

01:33:59.250 --> 01:34:00.958
has taken over.

01:34:04.250 --> 01:34:06.041
Let me die with Samantha.

01:34:07.291 --> 01:34:08.416
I can't leave you, man.

01:34:08.583 --> 01:34:09.708
Leave!

01:34:10.166 --> 01:34:11.916
Just go!

01:34:13.083 --> 01:34:13.916
And you.

01:34:15.291 --> 01:34:16.166
You,

01:34:16.750 --> 01:34:17.833
love him

01:34:18.375 --> 01:34:20.000
like you've never loved.

01:34:22.083 --> 01:34:23.291
Because at the end,

01:34:24.416 --> 01:34:26.875
all that counts is love.

01:34:31.041 --> 01:34:32.458
Thank you for everything.

01:34:33.708 --> 01:34:36.458
I'll never forget what you did for us.

01:34:42.625 --> 01:34:44.750
Drazik? Come closer.

01:34:49.583 --> 01:34:50.875
Don't trust her.

01:34:51.625 --> 01:34:52.625
They're all sluts.

01:35:28.208 --> 01:35:29.208
Wait a minute.

01:35:30.958 --> 01:35:32.041
What's wrong?

01:35:37.375 --> 01:35:39.791
I was sure something else would happen.

01:35:42.208 --> 01:35:43.375
In fact, no.

01:35:55.916 --> 01:35:57.125
I'm not too heavy?

01:35:57.291 --> 01:35:58.250
No, don't worry.

01:35:58.416 --> 01:36:00.208
You're like a backpack with legs.

01:36:00.375 --> 01:36:01.833
Look, a squirrel!

01:36:02.791 --> 01:36:04.583
And the doe over there...

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.458
Bad omen.

01:36:07.333 --> 01:36:08.500
I'm hungry.

01:36:08.708 --> 01:36:11.250
The forest will give us all we need.

01:36:11.833 --> 01:36:13.833
I just hope we won't see an otter.

01:36:17.291 --> 01:36:22.416
