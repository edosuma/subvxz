WEBVTT

00:01.501 --> 00:03.201
So to wrap up our
end-of-the-year conference,

00:03.236 --> 00:05.070
I'll just say Emme's a joy
to have in my classroom.

00:05.105 --> 00:09.074
Aside from the Leo incident,
she's had an excellent year.

00:09.109 --> 00:11.176
Great, let's go.

00:11.211 --> 00:13.145
Wait, w-what incident?
Who's Leo?

00:13.180 --> 00:15.514
Oh, who's anybody really?
(laughs)

00:15.549 --> 00:17.115
Let's get some ice cream, huh?

00:17.150 --> 00:18.283
Hey, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

00:18.318 --> 00:21.586
I need to know why
Leo makes you so happy

00:21.621 --> 00:23.155
and you so nervous.

00:23.190 --> 00:25.824
(sighs) Okay, last month,

00:25.859 --> 00:28.126
Emme told me that there was
this older kid,

00:28.161 --> 00:29.694
Leo, who was making fun of her.

00:29.729 --> 00:32.197
So, I told her the only way
to deal with bullies

00:32.232 --> 00:34.199
is to give as good as you get.

00:34.234 --> 00:36.368
You told her to
make fun of another kid?

00:36.403 --> 00:38.203
Don't get upset
yet, there's more.

00:38.238 --> 00:40.338
(chuckles)
Emme?

00:40.373 --> 00:42.240
I called Leo "lazy bones"

00:42.275 --> 00:44.176
'cause he's always
sitting in his chair.

00:44.211 --> 00:47.813
Oh, well, that's not so bad.

00:47.848 --> 00:50.149
Then he just rolled away.

00:53.720 --> 00:55.454
He was in a wheelchair?

00:55.489 --> 00:58.223
Because he has a broken leg.
A broken leg, that's all.

00:58.258 --> 01:00.125
Okay, no ice cream for you.

01:00.160 --> 01:02.194
Well...
Come on.

01:03.563 --> 01:05.230
Enjoy the ride home, Mr. Burns.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.601
Hey, what I heard
your teacher saying

01:09.636 --> 01:12.637
is that you are
making good progress.

01:12.672 --> 01:16.241
So we're oh for two on
the teacher conferences.

01:16.276 --> 01:17.709
Oh, wait,
there's the library.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.544
Didn't Kate say

01:19.579 --> 01:21.213
she'd be in there
studying with Mandy?

01:21.248 --> 01:24.182
Yeah, she said she was gonna
get a ride home with her.

01:24.217 --> 01:26.585
But it says it's closed.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.153
It's locked.

01:28.188 --> 01:29.221
So, where is she?

01:29.256 --> 01:30.889
I mean, she knows
she's supposed to let us know

01:30.924 --> 01:33.125
if her plans change.
Well, text her.

01:33.160 --> 01:35.828
Oh, I'm gonna
text the heck out of her.

01:37.430 --> 01:39.764
"Where are you?"

01:39.799 --> 01:41.166
(phone chimes)

01:41.201 --> 01:42.667
Adam, she's not answering.

01:42.702 --> 01:44.269
Well, it's only been
two seconds.

01:44.304 --> 01:45.437
How can you be so calm?

01:45.472 --> 01:46.905
She-she could be
in a ditch somewhere.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.240
Because she's not in a ditch.

01:48.275 --> 01:50.475
They filled all those in
years ago.

01:50.510 --> 01:52.410
Oh, she's answering.
Oh, thank God.

01:52.445 --> 01:53.612
I made that thing up
about ditches.

01:53.647 --> 01:55.347
There's ditches everywhere.

01:55.382 --> 01:56.348
(phone chimes)

01:56.383 --> 01:58.683
"At the library,
almost finished with homework."

01:58.718 --> 02:00.585
(gasps)
Adam, she lied.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.254
Straight to my phone!

02:02.289 --> 02:03.755
You know,
this isn't the first time

02:03.790 --> 02:05.223
she said she was at the library.

02:05.258 --> 02:07.259
How many of those
other times were lies?

02:07.294 --> 02:08.260
Who knows? Probably a lot.

02:08.295 --> 02:10.362
I mean, it's right there
in the name: lie-brary.

02:11.731 --> 02:12.597
What are we gonna do?

02:12.632 --> 02:14.199
Well, she's gonna
come home sometime.

02:14.234 --> 02:15.233
And when she does...

02:15.268 --> 02:16.868
ADAM and ANDI:
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

02:16.903 --> 02:18.203
That's gonna be fun.

02:18.238 --> 02:19.638
Oh, you are gonna
see a show.

02:21.374 --> 02:22.440
ANDI:
<i> Katie's gonna be</i>

02:22.475 --> 02:24.776
coming through that door
any minute, and when she does,

02:24.811 --> 02:26.211
busted.
ADAM: Okay, wait.

02:26.246 --> 02:27.679
Who's gonna say,
"How was the library?"

02:27.714 --> 02:29.414
'Cause whoever says it
has to be cool.

02:29.449 --> 02:30.782
Okay?

02:30.817 --> 02:31.649
You can't say,

02:31.685 --> 02:32.918
(sarcastically):
"How was the library?"

02:34.321 --> 02:35.687
She'll know something's up.

02:35.722 --> 02:37.756
Well, who would
say it like that?

02:40.794 --> 02:42.928
You get excited.

02:42.963 --> 02:45.530
Okay, you ask her.

02:45.565 --> 02:47.299
But then, when she lies,
I'm lowering the boom.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.301
I don't have to be cool
to lower the boom.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.403
Oh, that boom
is getting lowered.

02:51.438 --> 02:52.437
(Adam and Andi laugh maniacally)

02:52.472 --> 02:53.705
Yeah.

02:53.740 --> 02:55.607
Ooh, here she comes!
Teddy, be cool!

02:59.379 --> 03:00.345
Hey, guys.

03:00.380 --> 03:02.414
Oh, hey, Katie.

03:02.449 --> 03:07.252
Hey, so, I don't
know, like, uh...

03:07.287 --> 03:09.354
how was the library?

03:10.490 --> 03:12.958
Great.
I got a lot of homework done.

03:12.993 --> 03:14.893
No, you didn't
because it was closed!

03:14.928 --> 03:16.361
Boom lowered!

03:17.397 --> 03:18.229
That's right.

03:18.265 --> 03:19.564
We went to the library
to look for you,

03:19.599 --> 03:20.431
but you weren't there.

03:20.467 --> 03:22.400
Wait, you guys
are checking up on me?

03:22.435 --> 03:24.236
I'm 14, I don't need you guys

03:24.271 --> 03:25.537
looking over my shoulder
all the time.

03:25.572 --> 03:26.705
Oh, yes, you do.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.507
As someone who
was 14 once,

03:29.542 --> 03:33.478
I can tell you from experience
that you are not smart.

03:34.514 --> 03:35.680
I mean, it's not your fault.

03:35.715 --> 03:37.449
Your brain's just not
fully formed yet.

03:37.484 --> 03:38.450
It's like Jell-O

03:38.485 --> 03:40.418
before you put it in the fridge.

03:40.453 --> 03:41.586
ADAM:
Yeah.

03:41.621 --> 03:43.255
Yeah, you open a
14-year-old brain,

03:43.290 --> 03:45.691
it's just a clown in
there pulling levers.

03:46.960 --> 03:50.362
So just do yourself a favor
and tell the truth, all right?

03:50.397 --> 03:52.931
Because you weren't
at the school library.

03:52.966 --> 03:56.368
Yeah, because I was at the
public library down the street.

04:04.878 --> 04:06.745
BOTH:
Oh.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.747
Okay, well, what would
you say if I told you

04:08.782 --> 04:09.948
we went and looked
for you there, too?

04:09.983 --> 04:13.485
Did you look for me on the
first floor or the second floor?

04:13.520 --> 04:15.920
Both.

04:15.955 --> 04:17.789
(laughs)
There is no second floor.

04:21.027 --> 04:23.695
(scoffs) If you don't
believe me, you can call Mandy.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.697
Oh, no, we're good.

04:25.732 --> 04:27.365
All right, you
just think about

04:27.400 --> 04:29.268
what almost happened
here, young lady.

04:30.537 --> 04:32.671
And what we almost
did about it.

04:39.746 --> 04:41.647
Was that the show?

04:44.351 --> 04:46.551
¶ ¶

04:54.561 --> 04:56.828
There's no way Katie was
at the public library.

04:56.863 --> 04:58.496
Yeah, well, she knows
we can't prove it

04:58.531 --> 05:00.899
because clearly we have
never been to the library.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.403
I mean, I guess we could
call her friend, Mandy,

05:05.438 --> 05:06.771
and check her story.

05:06.806 --> 05:09.741
Oh, I don't want
to talk to Mandy.

05:09.776 --> 05:12.611
Yeah. Mandy's the worst.

05:14.114 --> 05:17.316
(whines): "I went
to San Francisco last summer."

05:19.119 --> 05:20.618
Yeah.

05:20.653 --> 05:24.522
"And my hair was, like,
(scoffs) I can't even."

05:24.557 --> 05:28.360
You know what, she's just gonna
back up Katie's story anyway.

05:28.395 --> 05:31.096
So, how do we find out
where she really was?

05:31.131 --> 05:33.932
Easy. We look at her phone.
You want to know the truth?

05:33.967 --> 05:37.002
It's in there between, uh,
Snapgrams and the Facechats.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.874
A teenager's phone
is like their diary, right?

05:42.909 --> 05:45.877
Her whole life is in there.
It's a huge invasion of privacy.

05:45.912 --> 05:48.646
(laughs):
Okay.

05:48.681 --> 05:51.549
Nobody in this house
has privacy.

05:51.584 --> 05:54.819
All right? I have not gone
to the bathroom in 14 years

05:54.854 --> 05:58.123
without a little hand
sliding under the door.

05:58.158 --> 06:00.825
Look, I say
we do my phone thing.

06:00.860 --> 06:03.962
Okay. Well, since
your last parenting gem

06:03.997 --> 06:05.831
was heckling a wheelchair kid...

06:07.133 --> 06:09.534
...I think I'm gonna
take the lead on this one.

06:09.569 --> 06:11.136
(groans)
Okay? I say

06:11.171 --> 06:12.404
that we give her some freedom

06:12.439 --> 06:14.539
and let her
learn from her mistakes.

06:14.574 --> 06:18.510
That's just...
fancy doing nothing!

06:19.212 --> 06:20.011
(door opens)

06:20.046 --> 06:22.914
Hey, you left Emme's
artwork behind.

06:22.949 --> 06:25.116
Oh, thanks, Lowell.
Mm-hmm.

06:25.151 --> 06:28.487
Boy, they really throw the word
"art" around down there.

06:30.757 --> 06:32.123
Hey, Lowell, let me ask you:

06:32.158 --> 06:34.058
don't you think
it's an invasion of privacy

06:34.093 --> 06:35.627
to look through
your daughter's phone?

06:35.662 --> 06:38.096
Please. If I could,
I'd put a GPS microchip

06:38.131 --> 06:40.165
in my girls
like they do with dogs.

06:42.202 --> 06:44.502
But I spoke to my vet about it,

06:44.537 --> 06:46.838
and our relationship
has been strained ever since.

06:48.508 --> 06:50.008
You hear that?

06:50.043 --> 06:51.810
There's dads way crazier
than me out there.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.578
Thanks, Lowell.

06:53.613 --> 06:57.215
Let me know if you make any
progress on chipping your kids.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.551
I think there's
a guy in Sweden.

07:02.489 --> 07:05.023
Well, I'm telling you, we
can't just let Katie lie to us

07:05.058 --> 07:06.658
with no consequences, okay?

07:06.693 --> 07:08.860
She has to know
we're smarter than her.

07:08.895 --> 07:10.929
Okay, here's my compromise,
all right?

07:10.964 --> 07:13.064
I-I won't go into her phone,

07:13.099 --> 07:14.766
but it does come with

07:14.801 --> 07:16.734
a tracking app,
so we can turn it on

07:16.769 --> 07:18.069
and see where she goes.

07:18.104 --> 07:21.873
Wow. Okay. I'm in.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.009
Hey, should we do that
to each other's phones?

07:25.044 --> 07:26.044
You know, for safety?

07:27.747 --> 07:29.581
I already did it to yours.

07:32.919 --> 07:36.655
You go to Popeyes Chicken a lot.

07:41.728 --> 07:43.261
(quietly):
Okay, Kate's asleep.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.129
Okay, great.
So we sneak in, grab the phone,

07:45.164 --> 07:47.198
turn on the tracking,
put the phone back, sneak out,

07:47.233 --> 07:49.501
finish<i> House Hunters</i>
<i> International,</i> fall asleep.

07:49.536 --> 07:50.535
Right.

07:51.738 --> 07:53.037
You ready?
Yep. Let's do it.

07:53.072 --> 07:54.939
Okay. What?
Wait, wait,
wait, wait.

07:54.974 --> 07:57.542
You should know that sometimes
when I go to Popeyes,

07:57.577 --> 07:59.210
it's just to get a soda.

07:59.245 --> 08:00.712
Okay.
Yeah, and if

08:00.747 --> 08:03.014
you bring your own cup,
it's only 50 cents.
Oh.

08:03.049 --> 08:05.683
Can we go now?
Yeah, yeah,
I'm ready. Let's go.

08:05.718 --> 08:06.684
Okay.
(sniffs)

08:06.719 --> 08:07.619
Wait, wait, wait.
What?

08:07.654 --> 08:09.254
You have got to be kidding me.

08:09.289 --> 08:10.622
I am.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.290
Oh.
Huh?

08:12.325 --> 08:13.658
(laughs):
That is a good one.

08:13.693 --> 08:15.694
Right.
All right, let's go.

08:27.707 --> 08:29.207
(light switch clicks)

08:31.110 --> 08:33.244
What are you guys doing?

08:33.279 --> 08:34.880
Uh, sleepwalking.

08:36.082 --> 08:37.615
At the same time.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.584
Yeah, we do
everything together.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.320
(laughs)
No, no, not really.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.188
You know,
Dad and his midnight jokes.

08:44.223 --> 08:46.157
(chuckles)
More like sleep-joking.

08:46.192 --> 08:48.293
(laughs)
Eh...

08:48.328 --> 08:50.762
Why do you have my phone?

08:53.199 --> 08:55.300
Uh, well, I couldn't find mine,

08:55.335 --> 08:58.603
so we thought we'd use yours to
call mine and get it to ring.

08:58.638 --> 09:01.640
Why couldn't you just
use Mom's phone?

09:04.177 --> 09:05.677
Because her phone is with mine.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.145
Even our phones
do everything together.

09:07.180 --> 09:07.979
(sputters)

09:09.616 --> 09:11.749
Hey, well, we'll just
give you this back

09:11.784 --> 09:14.252
and-and you can
go to sleep. Right.

09:14.287 --> 09:18.590
Or... are you
already asleep?

09:19.359 --> 09:22.660
This might
all be a dream.

09:22.695 --> 09:24.863
(humming eerily)

09:28.401 --> 09:29.300
Nighty night.

09:29.335 --> 09:30.635
(chuckles)

09:30.670 --> 09:33.705
Well, that was
a disaster.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.807
Well, not entirely.
While you were talking to Kate

09:35.842 --> 09:37.342
and she was distracted,
I managed to

09:37.377 --> 09:39.844
turn on the tracking before
we gave her the phone back.

09:39.879 --> 09:41.846
Get out!

09:41.881 --> 09:43.281
Pretty good, huh?

09:43.316 --> 09:44.616
Yeah, yeah, really
makes up for the...

09:44.651 --> 09:46.884
(humming eerily)

09:46.919 --> 09:49.220
I get excited!

09:51.658 --> 09:53.625
Okay, I dropped Teddy and Emme
off at your parents,

09:53.660 --> 09:54.859
so we have all day
to track Kate.

09:54.894 --> 09:56.361
Okay, great.
Yeah, when Katie left,

09:56.396 --> 09:58.229
she said she was gonna
hole up at Mandy's

09:58.264 --> 09:59.864
because they have
some school project.

09:59.899 --> 10:01.132
Lie.
Yeah.

10:01.167 --> 10:02.967
So I said, "Are you
going anywhere else?"

10:03.002 --> 10:03.968
She said, "No."

10:04.003 --> 10:04.869
Lie.

10:04.904 --> 10:06.738
Mm-hmm. So I said,
"You call me if you do."

10:06.773 --> 10:07.739
She said, "Okay."

10:07.774 --> 10:08.640
Big lie.

10:08.675 --> 10:10.341
Yeah.

10:10.376 --> 10:11.676
That's one minute
of conversation,

10:11.711 --> 10:13.711
three possible lies.
That's a hat trick.

10:13.746 --> 10:16.648
(scoffs) Man, I can't
wait to catch her.
Huh.

10:16.683 --> 10:18.750
Ooh, and then you can
take a picture of me with her

10:18.785 --> 10:20.818
like I caught a big fish.
Yeah.

10:20.853 --> 10:22.654
All right, let's find out
where she really is.

10:22.689 --> 10:24.355
Time to press
the button of truth.

10:24.390 --> 10:26.424
Okay.
(sniffs)

10:26.459 --> 10:27.825
What does it say?

10:27.860 --> 10:29.694
Says she's right behind us.

10:29.729 --> 10:31.663
What? Oh...
(laughs)

10:31.698 --> 10:32.664
I got you.

10:32.699 --> 10:35.667
Okay. It says
she's at, uh...

10:35.702 --> 10:38.369
Mick's Ale House.

10:38.404 --> 10:39.871
That's a bar.

10:39.906 --> 10:42.707
A bar?
That's worse than a ditch!

10:42.742 --> 10:44.709
We got to go get
her right now.

10:44.744 --> 10:46.844
She never went to a bar before
she was friends with Mandy.

10:46.879 --> 10:48.846
Yeah, never trust
your daughter with someone

10:48.881 --> 10:51.082
who's "been to San Francisco."

10:59.158 --> 11:01.259
(door opens)

11:01.294 --> 11:03.094
(gasps)
There she is.

11:03.129 --> 11:04.028
Oh, my God.

11:04.063 --> 11:05.329
Thank God she's okay.

11:05.364 --> 11:07.732
I'm gonna kill her.

11:07.767 --> 11:09.934
Know what? Now it's time
to really lower the boom.

11:09.969 --> 11:12.937
Yeah, that first time was just
practice; we are warmed up now.

11:12.972 --> 11:14.939
You're coming home with us,
young lady.

11:14.974 --> 11:16.241
Oh.

11:17.477 --> 11:19.143
Okay.

11:19.178 --> 11:20.812
I'm sorry.
You know, w-we thought

11:20.847 --> 11:22.013
you were someone else.

11:22.048 --> 11:24.315
Oh.

11:24.350 --> 11:27.118
What's the name
of this place, again?

11:27.153 --> 11:28.753
The Over My Dead Body Bar.

11:28.788 --> 11:30.121
That's it. Yeah, yeah.

11:30.156 --> 11:32.023
I mean, what kind of degenerates
hang out in a bar

11:32.058 --> 11:33.925
at 11:30 in the morning?
(chuckles)

11:33.960 --> 11:36.127
Hey, guys.

11:36.162 --> 11:37.495
Well, that answers that.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.464
What are you guys doing here?

11:39.499 --> 11:41.299
What are<i> you</i> doing here?

11:41.334 --> 11:42.366
Well, I'm in the dart league

11:42.401 --> 11:43.367
that I talked you
into sponsoring.

11:43.402 --> 11:45.336
Dart league?

11:45.371 --> 11:46.971
You said it was
a Little League.

11:47.006 --> 11:49.974
Well, it is a little league.
There's only four teams.

11:50.009 --> 11:53.044
Okay. I-I'll just call Kate.

11:53.079 --> 11:55.213
We've been tracking Kate's
phone. It says she's here.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.215
It's ringing.

11:57.250 --> 12:00.218
(phone vibrating)

12:00.253 --> 12:03.187
Why is
your pocket buzzing?

12:03.222 --> 12:05.089
But that-that's
Kate's phone.

12:05.124 --> 12:07.158
Why do you have Kate's phone?
I-I guess I grabbed it

12:07.193 --> 12:08.926
by accident when I was
over there this morning.

12:08.961 --> 12:10.495
(sighs)
It looks just like mine.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.764
Or...

12:12.799 --> 12:14.932
Katie switched phones
with Don to throw us off.

12:14.967 --> 12:17.101
Yeah, she must've figured out
that we turned her tracking on.

12:17.136 --> 12:20.505
And we wasted all day
chasing down this barfly.

12:20.540 --> 12:23.074
Hey. I'm an athlete.

12:23.109 --> 12:25.476
Yeah, if-if you can drink beer
while you're doing it,

12:25.511 --> 12:26.811
it's not a sport.

12:26.846 --> 12:28.780
Yeah, but the
problem is,

12:28.815 --> 12:31.249
once again, we have no idea
where Katie is.

12:31.284 --> 12:33.184
You know what?

12:33.219 --> 12:35.453
Forget privacy.
We're going into her phone.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.155
Well, we don't have a choice.

12:37.190 --> 12:38.823
She's like a counterintelligence
mastermind.

12:38.858 --> 12:40.992
We're dealing with freaking
Jason Bourne here.

12:45.131 --> 12:46.898
(exhales):
Wow.

12:46.933 --> 12:49.901
20 minutes inside a
teenage girl's brain.

12:49.936 --> 12:52.837
That was terrifying.

12:52.872 --> 12:56.140
If they're the future,
we're doomed.

12:56.175 --> 12:57.909
She doesn't have
a clown pulling levers,

12:57.944 --> 13:00.245
she's got a monkey
throwing bananas.

13:02.849 --> 13:05.082
Well, at least we know
where Kate is now.

13:05.117 --> 13:06.818
She and Mandy made plans

13:06.853 --> 13:09.287
to meet some girls at
Beacon Street Coffee.

13:09.322 --> 13:12.090
Yeah. And then they somehow made
their texts set off fireworks.

13:14.093 --> 13:16.194
After we punish her, I'm gonna
make her show me how to do that,

13:16.229 --> 13:18.196
because that's just fun.

13:18.231 --> 13:21.065
Wow. (laughs)

13:21.100 --> 13:23.601
Mandy sure has a lot to say
about those red sweatpants

13:23.636 --> 13:25.236
you wore to drop-off
last week.

13:25.271 --> 13:27.939
What? She said
she liked them.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.941
She liked making
fun of them.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.109
You know, when a man's wearing
sweatpants in public,

13:32.144 --> 13:34.111
things have already
gone wrong for him that day.

13:34.146 --> 13:35.580
(scoffs)

13:35.615 --> 13:38.249
Mandy!

13:38.284 --> 13:39.250
Let's go bust Katie.

13:39.285 --> 13:40.952
Yeah. Yeah.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.954
But if Mandy catches
a little shrapnel,

13:42.989 --> 13:44.989
that's okay, too.

13:49.595 --> 13:52.997
Oh, there she is, there she is,
there she is.

13:54.300 --> 13:56.100
Why would Katie lie about

13:56.135 --> 13:58.603
meeting people we know at a
place that we'd let her go?

13:58.638 --> 14:01.505
Yeah. It's like Jason Bourne
jumped off a building

14:01.540 --> 14:03.941
just to hang out
with his judgy friend Mandy.

14:03.976 --> 14:06.344
It just doesn't
make any sense.

14:06.379 --> 14:09.881
Yeah, we didn't lie about stuff
like this when we were kids.

14:09.916 --> 14:12.216
Well, we didn't have to.
We'd just walk out the door

14:12.251 --> 14:14.485
in the morning, and made sure
we were home by dark.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.355
Yeah. My parents
liked it that way.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.590
It freed up time for my dad
to smoke cigarettes

14:19.625 --> 14:22.560
and hose down the driveway
in his tank top.

14:22.595 --> 14:24.195
So much hair everywhere,

14:24.230 --> 14:26.231
you couldn't tell
if he was coming or going.

14:29.268 --> 14:31.269
Hey, do you think
Katie lied to us

14:31.304 --> 14:33.237
because she wants
the freedom we had?

14:33.272 --> 14:36.407
You know, I mean, we know where
she is every second of her life.

14:36.442 --> 14:38.509
Well, yeah, but
we have to, right?

14:38.544 --> 14:39.543
I mean, times
have changed.

14:39.578 --> 14:41.279
The Internet
has taught us

14:41.314 --> 14:43.547
that literally every other
person in the world besides us

14:43.582 --> 14:45.216
is a cranked-up
sex maniac.

14:45.251 --> 14:47.051
I know, I know. I just...

14:47.086 --> 14:50.354
I never thought about it
from Katie's side before.

14:50.389 --> 14:52.690
You know, some of
my best times as a kid

14:52.725 --> 14:55.393
were when I was out there
in the world, on my own.

14:55.428 --> 14:59.230
Yeah. She'll never
have that feeling.

14:59.265 --> 15:01.098
It's kind of sad.

15:01.133 --> 15:02.967
Yeah.

15:04.203 --> 15:06.003
(tongue clicks)

15:06.038 --> 15:08.205
Okay, let's go bust her.
No, Adam.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.274
What? We're not
gonna do anything?

15:10.309 --> 15:11.976
Well, you just said
you understood her.

15:12.011 --> 15:13.210
Well, yeah, I understand her.

15:13.245 --> 15:14.645
But I've been running
all over town,

15:14.680 --> 15:16.681
I'm hot, I haven't had lunch,
and somebody's got to pay.

15:16.716 --> 15:19.083
Okay...
Plus, we agreed

15:19.118 --> 15:21.319
that we can't let Katie
think she's smarter than us.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.487
Look, don't worry, all right?
We will figure out a way

15:23.522 --> 15:25.323
to let her know who's
really in charge.

15:25.358 --> 15:26.190
Okay? Come on.

15:26.226 --> 15:28.059
I still haven't heard
the word "lunch."

15:28.094 --> 15:30.295
And we will get
you some lunch.

15:32.231 --> 15:34.198
I'm telling you, if Katie feels
the need to lie to us

15:34.233 --> 15:35.633
because we're looking
over her shoulder,

15:35.668 --> 15:37.702
let's see how she feels
when we don't look at all.

15:37.737 --> 15:41.072
But what if
she feels good?

15:41.107 --> 15:43.474
She won't. Trust me.
We need to change it up.

15:43.509 --> 15:46.544
She beats us because
she knows our whole playbook.

15:46.579 --> 15:50.014
Run, run, pass, punt.

15:50.049 --> 15:52.183
Yeah, but this time
we'll blow her mind

15:52.218 --> 15:54.251
and hit her with
the flea flicker.

15:54.286 --> 15:57.188
I love it
when you talk football to me.

15:57.223 --> 15:58.255
Aw...
(both chuckle)

15:58.290 --> 15:59.223
(key turning in lock)

15:59.258 --> 16:02.026
Here she comes.

16:02.061 --> 16:03.361
Hey, guys.

16:04.330 --> 16:06.197
I know I'm late,
don't freak out.

16:06.232 --> 16:09.334
Oh, you're late?
Hmm, hadn't noticed.

16:11.437 --> 16:13.037
Oh, okay, well,
aren't you gonna ask me

16:13.072 --> 16:14.171
how things went
at Mandy's house?

16:14.206 --> 16:16.574
I'm not. Are you?

16:16.609 --> 16:19.210
Uh, let me guess:
selfie, selfie,

16:19.245 --> 16:21.612
Mandy made fun of
something I'm wearing.

16:21.647 --> 16:23.781
We're good.

16:23.816 --> 16:26.784
So that's it?

16:26.819 --> 16:30.354
Well, what else
would there be?

16:30.389 --> 16:33.357
I don't know, you guys just
usually have a lot of questions.

16:33.392 --> 16:35.426
Well, I mean, you're 14
now; it's like you said,

16:35.461 --> 16:37.795
you don't need us looking over
your shoulder all the time.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.764
I mean, if this was
a hundred years ago,

16:39.799 --> 16:42.200
you'd have five
kids by now.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.202
(scoffs) But...

16:45.237 --> 16:47.238
Uh, could you keep it down?
We're reading.

16:50.376 --> 16:52.710
Okay, what is going on here?

16:52.745 --> 16:54.545
I-I mean, I was gone all day,

16:54.580 --> 16:56.480
and you're not asking
any questions?

16:56.515 --> 16:59.150
You know,
I wasn't even at Mandy's.

16:59.185 --> 17:00.384
(both gasp)

17:00.419 --> 17:02.286
BOTH:
What?

17:03.522 --> 17:05.589
Yeah, and you had no idea.

17:05.624 --> 17:07.458
I could've been in a ditch.

17:07.493 --> 17:10.595
I mean, where have you guys
even been all day?

17:12.798 --> 17:15.399
BOTH:
The library.

17:15.434 --> 17:19.270
I don't know what's going on
here, but I don't like it.

17:19.305 --> 17:20.638
So...
(clears throat)

17:20.673 --> 17:22.540
you don't like it
when we're hands off,

17:22.575 --> 17:24.408
and you also
don't like it

17:24.443 --> 17:26.444
when we're looking
over your shoulder?

17:27.446 --> 17:29.413
Being a teenager's
hard, Adam.

17:29.448 --> 17:31.182
Mm.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.384
So hard.

17:33.419 --> 17:34.585
Okay.

17:36.422 --> 17:39.424
I'm gonna make a deal with you,
kid, because I like you.

17:40.626 --> 17:43.127
We'll give you
a little more freedom,

17:43.162 --> 17:45.329
and you give us
a little more honesty.

17:45.364 --> 17:47.131
But with this
new freedom

17:47.166 --> 17:49.767
comes the possibility
that you might end up somewhere

17:49.802 --> 17:53.771
that you don't feel safe,
or you just want out.

17:53.806 --> 17:55.639
And if that happens,

17:55.674 --> 17:59.677
you can call us,
anytime, any place,

17:59.712 --> 18:01.712
and we will come get you.

18:03.149 --> 18:04.682
Okay? No questions asked. Hmm?

18:04.717 --> 18:06.484
Exactly.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.486
Except there will be
a lot of questions.

18:08.521 --> 18:10.488
ADAM:
Mm-hmm.

18:10.523 --> 18:12.490
Oh, and, uh, by the way,
here's your phone.

18:12.525 --> 18:14.125
It was in Don's pocket.

18:14.160 --> 18:17.194
Any idea how it got there?

18:17.229 --> 18:19.864
Uh...

18:19.899 --> 18:24.235
Does this whole honesty thing
have to start right now?

18:24.270 --> 18:26.504
Well, I think that
answers our question.

18:26.539 --> 18:29.740
Got to get up pretty early in
the morning to fool us, babe.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.408
ADAM:
Mm-hmm.

18:31.443 --> 18:32.843
Now, why don't you go upstairs

18:32.878 --> 18:36.413
and think about what actually
happened here, young lady.

18:36.448 --> 18:39.783
And what we actually
did about it.

18:39.818 --> 18:40.818
Hmm?

18:47.560 --> 18:50.461
(both laugh)

18:50.496 --> 18:51.896
Who's smarter now?

18:51.931 --> 18:54.431
It's us.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.467
We just Jason Bourned
Jason Bourne.

18:56.502 --> 18:57.935
Uh.
(chuckles)

18:57.970 --> 18:59.937
She'll tell us
where she's going next time.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.872
We'll pretend
to give her

19:01.907 --> 19:03.741
her freedom so she
feels independent,

19:03.776 --> 19:07.178
but we'll track her every move
so we can sleep at night.

19:07.213 --> 19:10.481
Yeah. Yeah, and we'll call it
Operation False Freedom.

19:10.516 --> 19:13.551
Oh, I like
that we have a code name.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.853
It makes us sound
like Navy SEALs.

19:15.888 --> 19:18.622
Well, we need to be. We're up
against some crafty opponents.

19:18.657 --> 19:19.657
(laughs)

19:22.995 --> 19:24.862
Honey?

19:25.998 --> 19:27.498
You were outside?

19:27.533 --> 19:30.534
Yeah, I was shooting
baskets with Devon.

19:30.569 --> 19:32.770
Buddy.

19:34.540 --> 19:36.374
Where are your pants?

19:38.244 --> 19:40.645
Forgot to wear
pants again!

19:42.748 --> 19:46.584
(sighs) Well, it's not
gonna be hard to outsmart him.

19:47.953 --> 19:49.954
No. That one
we got in the bag.

19:57.696 --> 20:00.798
Hi. Um, can I have one
doughnut hole, please?

20:00.833 --> 20:03.634
Oh, and-and the doughnut
that hole came from.

20:03.669 --> 20:07.238
(ringtone playing)

20:07.273 --> 20:08.472
Hello?

20:08.507 --> 20:10.474
Hey, babe. Coming home soon?

20:10.509 --> 20:14.011
Uh, yeah. Still at work,
just wrapping up a few things.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.447
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Well, uh, when you're done,

20:16.482 --> 20:18.983
can you bring some doughnuts
home for your family?

20:19.018 --> 20:21.952
Oh, you're tracking me now, too.

20:21.987 --> 20:25.022
Yes, I am. I'm not the only
secret snacker in this family,

20:25.057 --> 20:26.957
and I want that on the record.

20:26.992 --> 20:28.959
Hey, I could be
getting a coffee.

20:28.994 --> 20:31.929
Uh-huh, yeah, and when I go
to Popeyes, I just get soda.

20:31.964 --> 20:34.031
Fine.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.333
Now, I'll turn off my tracking
if you turn off yours.

20:36.368 --> 20:38.769
Deal. But seriously,
bring home some doughnuts.
