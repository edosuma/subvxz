00:19.520 --> 00:20.852
<i>Dwight?</i>

00:22.356 --> 00:23.356
<i>Dwight?</i>

00:26.443 --> 00:27.443
Honey?

00:28.195 --> 00:29.402
<i>Dwight? Can you hear me?</i>

00:30.072 --> 00:31.438
- Honey?
<i>- Can you hear me?</i>

00:32.448 --> 00:33.940
Is that you?

00:34.826 --> 00:35.942
<i>Dwight, can you hear me?</i>

00:39.206 --> 00:41.414
<i>Dwight? Dwight?</i>

02:14.426 --> 02:16.008
Where did you come from, boy?

02:24.102 --> 02:27.266
Come on. You just saved my life.

02:52.756 --> 02:56.500
<i>I'm glad you called, Morgan.
Glad as a grandma with a gravy boat.</i>

02:57.678 --> 03:00.045
I wasn't sure you were gonna be in range.

03:00.138 --> 03:03.677
<i>Well, now that we got
some of that Texas Tea on tap,</i>

03:03.767 --> 03:06.475
<i>we're running generators with repeaters
from here to Pecos.</i>

03:06.561 --> 03:08.393
<i>So, yeah, we are always in range.</i>

03:09.606 --> 03:13.725
<i>I told you the future wasn't
across that bridge, Morgan. I did try.</i>

03:14.444 --> 03:17.608
<i>But no use crying over spilt milk, right?</i>

03:19.491 --> 03:20.698
<i>Tell me where you are.</i>

03:21.952 --> 03:23.784
In a place called Humbug's Gulch.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.156
You pulling my leg right now?

03:28.667 --> 03:32.286
That Gulch is one of the biggest
settlements I ever came across.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.462
Two hundred and sixty-three souls.

03:35.048 --> 03:38.132
<i>Folks there found themselves in a spot
when that fishing hole ran dry,</i>

03:38.218 --> 03:39.550
<i>and I tried to help them,</i>

03:40.053 --> 03:41.715
but their crackpot of a leader...

03:42.764 --> 03:44.881
blind as a bat when it came to reality.

03:44.975 --> 03:47.467
He stood in the very spot
you're standing now,

03:47.561 --> 03:49.223
and he made the wrong call.

03:49.855 --> 03:52.313
<i>I'm just glad you're making
the smart one, Morgan.</i>

03:52.399 --> 03:53.935
This place...

03:55.652 --> 03:56.859
there's room for all of us.

03:56.945 --> 03:59.312
- We just need help clearing it out.
<i>- No.</i>

03:59.406 --> 04:01.443
That place is beyond repair.

04:01.533 --> 04:03.573
I'm afraid it's time
to move on to greener pastures.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.744
You're gonna take everybody, right?

04:10.834 --> 04:14.077
I'm gonna do whatever ensures
the most number of people survive.

04:14.171 --> 04:16.959
<i>I want your word that you're gonna
take us to the same place,</i>

04:17.048 --> 04:18.709
<i>that you'll keep us all together.</i>

04:19.259 --> 04:20.841
<i>No can do.</i>

04:20.927 --> 04:23.169
<i>You're each gonna go
where I think is best.</i>

04:24.097 --> 04:25.304
No, I gotta...

04:27.267 --> 04:28.883
We gotta do right by everybody.

04:32.981 --> 04:36.099
Right is for people
who want to feel good about themselves.

04:36.193 --> 04:39.106
People who can't make the hard calls
that need to be made.

04:39.780 --> 04:43.569
I have got 817 people
thriving under my auspices.

04:43.658 --> 04:45.991
- You've got how many?
<i>- I got 41.</i>

04:48.538 --> 04:49.824
Forty.

04:49.915 --> 04:51.122
<i>Right.</i>

04:51.750 --> 04:53.241
I'm sorry about Tom.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.911
But the rest of them
may end up just like him...

04:57.464 --> 05:00.548
<i>unless you are finally ready
to make the hard call, Morgan.</i>

05:00.634 --> 05:04.002
Unless you are finally ready
to protect their future.

05:07.098 --> 05:10.432
Should I come and get you or not?

05:33.083 --> 05:34.119
Yeah.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.411
Be there by the end of day.

05:40.090 --> 05:41.376
<i>Look at it this way.</i>

05:41.466 --> 05:45.460
You won't be together any more,
but you will be alive.

06:06.908 --> 06:07.908
I'm sorry.

06:24.593 --> 06:25.629
How you doing?

06:27.137 --> 06:28.799
Not gonna lie. I've been better.

06:34.269 --> 06:36.727
You really did everything you could,
Morgan.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.143
Thank you. So did you.

06:51.995 --> 06:53.531
- Yeah.
- They were in my pack.

07:05.717 --> 07:07.333
That guy I told you about.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.136
The one at the plant.

07:11.681 --> 07:13.217
I did tell him how I felt at the end.

07:14.809 --> 07:17.597
When it was clear
he wasn't gonna make it. We...

07:20.148 --> 07:21.355
We actually...

07:23.360 --> 07:24.360
Yeah.

07:26.154 --> 07:30.239
I think the reason I let it happen
was because I knew it was the end.

07:31.826 --> 07:33.546
Because I knew
it couldn't be anything more.

07:38.583 --> 07:41.997
That's why I didn't want you to tell me
whatever you were gonna tell me.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.249
Oh, I... I wasn't gonna...

07:44.673 --> 07:47.165
That's not what I wanted to tell you.

07:48.718 --> 07:51.131
And, you know,
we are gonna see each other again.

07:52.055 --> 07:53.967
No. No, we won't.

07:56.101 --> 07:58.935
For once, I finally know
how much time I have left.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.312
Until Virginia gets here.

08:02.899 --> 08:04.356
What are you talking about?

08:04.442 --> 08:07.355
She won't take me with her, Morgan.
You heard her.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.820
She only cares about the future.

08:09.906 --> 08:12.990
Well, it's not gonna happen.
I won't let that happen.

08:17.455 --> 08:19.037
You might not have a choice.

08:28.258 --> 08:30.466
<i>I don't want to wait any more.</i>

08:30.552 --> 08:32.635
<i>I think when we get to the Gulch,
we get married.</i>

08:34.972 --> 08:37.135
<i>I kind of hope I just keep...</i>

08:38.308 --> 08:39.509
<i>getting the chance to do this.</i>

08:41.020 --> 08:43.764
<i>I just want to be around
long enough to see it.</i>

08:44.983 --> 08:47.726
<i>The looks on everyone's faces
when we get there.</i>

08:53.158 --> 08:54.569
Everything all right?

08:56.036 --> 08:59.154
I don't want to go back to that person
I was before I met you.

09:00.123 --> 09:01.159
What?

09:01.916 --> 09:02.952
No.

09:06.254 --> 09:11.875
You gotta understand,
you don't need me to be you. Okay?

09:13.887 --> 09:14.887
I know.

09:16.639 --> 09:19.006
I just don't want to do any of this
without you.

09:22.103 --> 09:24.311
Well, we were alone before.

09:25.315 --> 09:26.931
Now we got something to fight for.

09:29.152 --> 09:30.359
I'm gonna fight.

09:41.039 --> 09:42.039
Al?

09:58.515 --> 09:59.847
Well, look at you.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.855
Think we can make it work here.

10:16.282 --> 10:17.489
What do you mean?

10:17.575 --> 10:18.695
Where'd you find the horses?

10:18.743 --> 10:22.157
I found 'em roaming around
what's left of the convoy.

10:23.331 --> 10:24.788
Don't you know what this means?

10:25.875 --> 10:29.619
- What?
- If they're alive, there's water nearby.

10:32.215 --> 10:33.422
She lied.

10:33.883 --> 10:37.172
That's right. We can make it work here.
We don't need her.

11:06.124 --> 11:07.456
Give that back to me.

11:07.542 --> 11:09.784
- You sure?
- Yeah. I can do this.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.245
I'm not afraid of it any more.

11:13.840 --> 11:14.876
I know.

11:16.301 --> 11:17.462
What are you doing?

11:19.804 --> 11:21.949
After the plane crash,
you said it was impossible for me

11:21.973 --> 11:24.716
to put a weapon between me
and losing people. You were right.

11:25.476 --> 11:27.916
I put it down, I found what I needed.
I'm not gonna lose that.

11:28.313 --> 11:31.477
I'm not gonna let her separate me
from the people that helped me get here.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.191
I think we can clear this place.

11:36.279 --> 11:37.999
No, really,
I think we can clear this place.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.614
Wait. Wait! Stop! Wait.

11:41.117 --> 11:44.281
You said we're not doing careful,
we're doing right.

11:47.373 --> 11:48.989
Go! Go! Back up, back up.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.770
Alicia, this fence ain't gonna hold
long enough to make a dent.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.786
It will. And we can clear it.

11:54.422 --> 11:56.584
We led everyone here. We have to try.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.837
But even if we did kill all the walkers,

11:58.927 --> 12:00.793
we need more than just a ghost town
and water.

12:00.887 --> 12:03.129
We need food, medical supplies...

12:03.223 --> 12:05.556
Well, if there's water,
maybe fish, maybe deer.

12:05.642 --> 12:09.135
Doesn't matter if we're fed.
You saw what Virginia did at the bridge.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.812
She is not walking away without a fight.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.167
He's right. We already lost Tom.

12:13.191 --> 12:15.979
Well, we're gonna lose more than that
if we go with her.

12:16.069 --> 12:19.062
Look, I am who I am
because of you folks. All right?

12:19.155 --> 12:21.192
I'd like to hang on to that.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.442
If we clear this place
and then we have to fight her,

12:24.535 --> 12:25.742
how do you think we'd manage?

12:25.828 --> 12:29.242
We got some long rifles,
a couple of pistols, not much ammo.

12:29.332 --> 12:31.727
If she comes with half as many people
as she did at the quarry,

12:31.751 --> 12:33.413
it's gonna get real messy, real quick.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.204
- No!
- Back up!

12:36.297 --> 12:37.629
Watch that side!

12:39.175 --> 12:40.175
Dwight.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.670
Put some weight in there.

12:46.140 --> 12:50.259
We're gonna have to take care of the dead,
and then we deal with Virginia.

13:00.154 --> 13:02.487
Maybe we can deal with both of them
at the same time.

13:04.325 --> 13:07.693
I see. All right. Hold it.
We'll get the horses.

13:08.371 --> 13:10.078
- Dwight, can you help him?
- Yeah.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.960
Alicia, I need you
to get everybody else out of here.

13:16.045 --> 13:18.583
- Take them as far away as you can.
- On it.

13:37.900 --> 13:40.608
We're not gonna kill her or her people.

13:40.695 --> 13:43.153
We're just gonna surround 'em,
take what we need,

13:43.239 --> 13:45.652
make 'em understand not to bother us here.

13:45.742 --> 13:48.155
Okay? Come on!

13:49.871 --> 13:51.032
Come on!

14:43.341 --> 14:45.333
This place is kinda rough
around the edges.

14:47.762 --> 14:50.254
Yeah, so was the stadium
when my mom found it.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.750
You know, rebuilding it,
turning it into something more,

14:59.774 --> 15:02.016
it gave her a sense of peace.

15:06.114 --> 15:07.696
You need a new medium, right?

15:30.972 --> 15:32.258
You doing all right?

15:33.975 --> 15:37.844
Stomach's feeling upside down,
but I can manage.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.432
The carousel ride was nice, Morgan,
but this...

15:45.111 --> 15:46.272
I needed this.

15:48.573 --> 15:50.280
June Bug, I think it's gonna work.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.650
Yeah.

15:52.743 --> 15:54.450
Maybe we did bring them
to the right place.

15:54.537 --> 15:55.537
I believe we did.

15:58.958 --> 16:02.497
When we get back,
I'm gonna make an honest woman outta you.

16:06.424 --> 16:08.256
There it is... the MRAP.

16:10.011 --> 16:13.379
Hey, there's a field
on the other side of that rise.

16:13.473 --> 16:16.136
The wind seems to be carrying the sound
away from the road.

16:16.225 --> 16:18.592
That's where we should lead the herd
till it's time.

16:19.395 --> 16:20.511
There's another thing.

16:21.272 --> 16:25.266
Just about a mile or so, there's a river.
That's how our rides are still alive.

16:25.359 --> 16:28.352
There's an access road
that cuts over to 1233.

16:28.446 --> 16:31.405
If she's coming for the MRAP,
she's gonna come from there.

16:32.033 --> 16:35.447
Can you and Daniel keep watch
while we lead them out of sight?

16:35.912 --> 16:37.369
Gotcha. Let's go.

16:39.207 --> 16:42.120
Dwight, you and June take the point.
Me and Morgan'll take the flank.

16:42.210 --> 16:44.452
- All right.
- Go, go.

16:46.506 --> 16:49.123
You're staying with us!
Stay with us now!

16:51.219 --> 16:53.552
Come on, come on! This way, this way!

16:55.181 --> 16:57.423
Thank you, Dwight, for what you're doing.

17:00.937 --> 17:02.473
We're all doing the best we can.

17:03.231 --> 17:05.564
Yeah, but, Virginia...

17:06.608 --> 17:09.477
she might be able to take you to Sherry.

17:09.569 --> 17:11.060
So thank you.

17:11.571 --> 17:13.608
- Hey, can I tell you something?
- Yeah.

17:14.825 --> 17:16.487
When I was out here on my own...

17:18.704 --> 17:21.367
I thought I heard Sherry on the walkie.

17:21.457 --> 17:24.621
Now, it could've been the heat.
It probably was, but...

17:25.461 --> 17:28.829
I'd like to think it was her
guiding me to do the right thing.

17:28.923 --> 17:30.710
We're doing the right thing, June.

17:31.467 --> 17:34.426
So when me and Sherry do meet up,
it'll be the way we want,

17:34.512 --> 17:37.346
and we won't have someone like Virginia
hanging over our heads.

17:39.225 --> 17:41.012
Yeah. Ready?

17:44.272 --> 17:45.729
This way! This way!

17:47.108 --> 17:48.108
Follow me!

17:52.071 --> 17:53.071
Come on!

17:58.452 --> 18:01.820
This way, this way! Come on!

18:09.088 --> 18:10.579
What do you think?

18:10.673 --> 18:13.837
Very New Testament.
I might be playing some of the oldies.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.376
Gun safe was almost empty.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.837
Morgan and the others
better stop her before she gets here.

18:18.931 --> 18:22.345
They will. If we need to step in
and help them, then we will.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.634
Something stuck in your craw, Al?

18:27.940 --> 18:30.148
I think we know
where the horses came from.

18:30.234 --> 18:33.068
Found these on some of the dead.
Her riders were here.

18:33.154 --> 18:35.066
Virginia's more full of shit
than we thought.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.989
- Hey, let me...
- Patience, my friend.

18:46.334 --> 18:48.667
And I use the term loosely.

18:48.753 --> 18:51.211
If this doesn't work,
we may be giving her the MRAP.

18:51.756 --> 18:54.339
They wouldn't go too far.
I have the starter.

19:01.974 --> 19:05.012
You think we should give up
and join Virginia.

19:07.104 --> 19:08.104
Yeah.

19:09.732 --> 19:12.270
I think
we should consider the opportunity.

19:13.778 --> 19:17.146
I think we should dissect what
"giving up" means in these circumstances.

19:17.239 --> 19:18.650
Accompanying her back.

19:19.992 --> 19:23.156
It may not be as bad
as we imagined in those settlements.

19:23.245 --> 19:25.862
She's not giving us a choice.

19:27.333 --> 19:30.667
That is all we need to know.

19:36.258 --> 19:37.294
Come on!

19:38.719 --> 19:41.052
Come on back!
Don't let 'em break off!

19:42.973 --> 19:45.886
We're not gonna be able to
keep this up much longer.

19:46.644 --> 19:48.727
Hey. You okay?

19:48.813 --> 19:49.813
Yeah.

19:55.277 --> 19:56.277
Here they come.

19:56.987 --> 19:59.104
- Call 'em!
- Hey, hey, hey!

20:00.533 --> 20:01.533
Come on!

20:01.951 --> 20:03.487
- We good?
- Yeah.

20:04.578 --> 20:07.036
There was a time when the cattle
worried about us eating them.

20:07.123 --> 20:08.123
Yeah.

20:08.874 --> 20:11.082
Hey, what's your favourite colour,
by the way?

20:11.168 --> 20:12.909
Green. Why?

20:13.003 --> 20:14.210
Just curious.

20:14.296 --> 20:15.296
Hey, hey!

20:16.132 --> 20:17.873
This way. Come on. Come on.

20:20.594 --> 20:24.008
No offence. Next time I want to do this
without training wheels.

20:25.099 --> 20:26.099
Next time?

20:27.393 --> 20:28.995
I said that
without even thinking about it.

20:29.019 --> 20:31.762
It's 'cause you know we're gonna do this,

20:31.856 --> 20:34.439
and you're gonna get more than one day.
Come on.

20:38.404 --> 20:39.404
They're here.

20:53.961 --> 20:55.327
Hey, the signal!

20:55.421 --> 20:57.708
All right. June, Morgan, take the point!

20:57.798 --> 21:00.461
Dwight, circle back!
Pull up the stragglers!

21:02.511 --> 21:05.379
Dwight, come on!
Get those walkers turned around!

21:06.807 --> 21:08.298
Come on.

21:08.392 --> 21:09.724
Come on, man.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.522
Sweet Jesus.

21:22.448 --> 21:23.484
Fuel 'em up!

21:32.541 --> 21:33.541
What?

21:39.089 --> 21:41.297
Oh, my God. Luciana.

21:47.681 --> 21:49.441
- Why is he signalling again?
- I don't know!

21:50.100 --> 21:53.514
<i>Call it off, call it off.
Hold up the herd.</i>

21:54.271 --> 21:56.012
<i>Luciana, she's with them.</i>

21:56.106 --> 21:57.688
We have to turn back.

21:57.775 --> 21:59.266
Let's go. Come on! Watch it!

21:59.860 --> 22:02.102
- Turn around!
- Turn 'em! Come on, come on!

22:03.656 --> 22:04.656
Come on! This way!

22:05.115 --> 22:06.526
Hey, hey, hey.

22:10.371 --> 22:11.452
What are you doing?

22:11.539 --> 22:14.828
I'll handle it. Head back to the Gulch.
Tell everyone to arm up.

22:18.087 --> 22:19.669
- Come on!
- Come on, Dwight!

22:20.172 --> 22:21.834
- Come on.
- Lead them away! Keep up!

22:30.224 --> 22:31.385
- Come on!
- Come on!

22:31.475 --> 22:32.636
Come on.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.060
- Easy, easy, easy.
- Come on.

22:38.649 --> 22:39.649
Come on.

22:46.073 --> 22:47.073
Dwight!

22:50.578 --> 22:51.578
Dwight!

23:12.308 --> 23:13.308
Dwight!

23:16.770 --> 23:18.056
Dwight!

23:43.380 --> 23:44.380
Shit.

23:55.184 --> 23:56.184
Come on.

24:01.857 --> 24:04.019
We gotta get their attention
or he's done for.

24:05.152 --> 24:06.152
Here. Here.

24:06.236 --> 24:09.070
Hey! Come here! Over here!

24:09.657 --> 24:10.657
Hey!

24:16.830 --> 24:19.163
Work fast!
That next wave of walkers will pin us in.

24:19.750 --> 24:20.750
Come on.

24:23.462 --> 24:24.462
Come on!

24:24.546 --> 24:26.208
Hey, here, here.

24:28.926 --> 24:31.168
Hey! Hey!

24:33.722 --> 24:35.714
Over here. Come on.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.344
Over here!

24:37.434 --> 24:42.099
Take control of the herd
and get back to the SWAT van now!

24:42.189 --> 24:43.555
I can handle myself!

24:43.649 --> 24:45.185
Shut up! Let us make the noise!

24:45.818 --> 24:46.818
Come on!

24:46.902 --> 24:48.188
Come on! Come on!

24:49.405 --> 24:51.738
This way! This way! Come on!

24:54.410 --> 24:55.410
Over here!

24:57.496 --> 25:00.989
I know what it's like
to live under someone

25:01.083 --> 25:03.325
who doesn't believe in the same things
as you do!

25:03.419 --> 25:06.162
And I can't let that happen to you!

25:07.339 --> 25:09.001
Hey, hey, hey!

25:09.091 --> 25:12.255
This is a tough call, John,
but it's the right one!

25:14.722 --> 25:15.883
- Come here!
- Dwight!

25:16.348 --> 25:17.348
Dwight!

25:17.850 --> 25:18.850
Dwight!

25:20.019 --> 25:21.931
You wanna try this
without training wheels?

25:22.021 --> 25:23.137
Yeah. Okay.

25:23.230 --> 25:24.457
- You've got this. Take the reins.
- All right.

25:24.481 --> 25:25.767
- You got it?
- Yeah.

25:27.568 --> 25:28.604
Go.

25:31.739 --> 25:35.608
John? Hey, hey, hey! I'm going after him!

25:35.701 --> 25:36.737
All right!

25:38.579 --> 25:40.821
Come on! Come!

25:47.171 --> 25:48.662
Come on, follow me. Hurry.

25:50.883 --> 25:51.883
Okay.

25:55.429 --> 25:57.011
We're on the perimeter. Hurry.

26:12.112 --> 26:13.148
Morgan, no!

26:13.238 --> 26:14.979
- We're not leaving you behind!
- No. No.

26:17.618 --> 26:19.154
You okay?

26:19.703 --> 26:21.911
- No, my leg.
- Shit.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.208
- Can you take this one?
- Yeah.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.291
Guys?

26:43.602 --> 26:46.219
You gotta stop thinking
we're gonna leave you to your own devices.

26:48.357 --> 26:49.357
Okay. What now?

26:51.235 --> 26:53.101
You hide, keep quiet.
We're gonna take a dip.

26:53.195 --> 26:54.982
- In deep.
- Come on!

26:55.072 --> 26:56.734
- Go.
- Come on!

26:58.283 --> 27:00.275
Good boy. Good boy.

27:04.832 --> 27:08.667
Come on, boy. Come on! Follow up! Come on!

27:10.629 --> 27:12.416
Come on! This way! This way!

27:14.091 --> 27:15.298
Come on!

27:16.260 --> 27:17.376
Come on! Come on!

27:24.059 --> 27:26.847
Come on! Over here!

28:13.901 --> 28:16.484
We're not gonna be able to fight her
without the walkers.

28:16.570 --> 28:19.153
We're all still alive. There's that.

28:21.783 --> 28:22.864
She wins.

28:34.922 --> 28:38.711
The people before,
they didn't die because they refused help.

28:40.093 --> 28:41.959
They died because they fought back.

28:42.804 --> 28:46.297
Virginia killed them.
Some of her soldiers died, too.

28:47.017 --> 28:48.599
And that's where the horses came from.

28:49.811 --> 28:50.892
If we fight her...

28:53.065 --> 28:54.272
we'll die, too.

28:55.150 --> 28:58.359
Maybe not,
if Vic is somewhere smooth-talking her.

28:59.404 --> 29:00.565
If that's what he's doing.

29:00.656 --> 29:03.114
It is. That <i>is</i> what he's doing.

29:08.163 --> 29:10.450
We have to hold on to what we have.

29:10.540 --> 29:13.157
She's got us vastly outnumbered
and outgunned.

29:13.669 --> 29:15.831
The only chance we had
went down the river.

29:17.589 --> 29:18.749
So we are just gonna give up.

29:18.799 --> 29:22.964
Not talking about giving up.
Just make sure everybody survives.

29:25.222 --> 29:27.509
Look, we did what we came out here to do.

29:28.350 --> 29:32.139
We helped people.
We helped a lot of people.

29:33.397 --> 29:36.481
And the only way that's gonna
mean something is if we keep them alive.

29:38.986 --> 29:40.522
- This is how.
- So, what?

29:40.612 --> 29:43.480
We're just gonna turn ourselves in?
Is that what's happening?

29:43.573 --> 29:46.316
No, she can take us wherever she wants.

29:46.910 --> 29:48.026
She can separate us.

29:48.120 --> 29:51.113
But she can't make us forget
what we did or who we are.

29:52.541 --> 29:53.657
She can't.

29:54.251 --> 29:55.992
So, that's ball game, then?

30:03.844 --> 30:06.052
It's not, no.

30:07.389 --> 30:09.255
'Cause we still got a little time left.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.016
Time for what?

30:14.688 --> 30:16.850
Live life the way we said we were gonna.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.207
You do look good in green.

31:19.294 --> 31:20.294
It's perfect.

31:20.379 --> 31:23.793
I knew it would be
the moment I saw it in the costume shop.

31:24.800 --> 31:25.800
Rings?

31:26.426 --> 31:28.292
- Oh.
- You have 'em?

31:28.387 --> 31:32.848
Anybody got any candy?
I don't have any... It's okay.

31:32.933 --> 31:35.846
I'll... I'll do you one better.

31:39.815 --> 31:40.815
I can't.

31:40.899 --> 31:43.516
I'm standing here
because of the two of you.

31:43.610 --> 31:44.851
You're gonna find Sherry...

31:44.945 --> 31:49.064
Oh, no, look,
I'm not sure what Virginia has in store,

31:49.157 --> 31:51.557
but I'm not gonna let her use Sherry
as some bargaining chip.

31:52.202 --> 31:54.990
I'll find her on my own terms.
When I do...

31:56.206 --> 31:57.413
I won't be needing these.

31:58.208 --> 32:01.076
'Cause it'll be a fresh start,
you know, for the both of us.

32:03.046 --> 32:04.878
- Thank you.
- Take 'em.

32:05.590 --> 32:06.751
- Thank you, Dwight.
- Here.

32:13.265 --> 32:18.511
Okay. Do you, John, take this woman
to be your lawfully wedded wife,

32:18.603 --> 32:22.517
in good times and in bad,
in sickness and in health,

32:22.607 --> 32:24.064
for all the rest of your days?

32:24.734 --> 32:28.478
I've loved you since the first day
you washed up on my shore.

32:29.364 --> 32:30.364
You bet I do.

32:35.454 --> 32:39.789
June, do you take this man
to be your lawfully wedded husband,

32:39.875 --> 32:43.789
in good times and in bad,
in sickness and in health,

32:43.879 --> 32:45.120
for all the rest of your days?

32:46.131 --> 32:47.131
I do.

32:54.264 --> 32:55.425
It's...

32:56.641 --> 32:57.677
Here.

33:01.062 --> 33:02.269
Thank you.

33:02.355 --> 33:03.562
Thank you, sweetheart.

33:11.281 --> 33:13.193
- You don't lose this.
- No, ma'am.

33:27.172 --> 33:29.414
It's a broken world,

33:29.508 --> 33:34.048
but each union sees
a little piece of everything set right.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.972
It's <i>tikkun olam</i>, the repair of the world.

33:38.600 --> 33:44.688
And it's with great pleasure
that I now pronounce you husband and wife.

33:49.569 --> 33:50.685
<i>Mazel tov</i>!

34:01.873 --> 34:05.082
<i>Well, it's all right</i>

34:06.211 --> 34:09.045
<i>Riding around in the breeze</i>

34:09.130 --> 34:12.214
<i>Well, it's all right</i>

34:12.717 --> 34:15.585
<i>If you find the love you please</i>

34:16.137 --> 34:18.971
<i>Well, it's all right</i>

34:20.350 --> 34:22.842
<i>Even when push comes to shove</i>

34:22.936 --> 34:26.100
<i>Well, it's all right</i>

34:27.065 --> 34:31.309
<i>If you found someone to love</i>

34:39.034 --> 34:40.867
- I love you.
- Love you.

34:44.248 --> 34:45.284
Jacob.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.264
This is it.

35:08.231 --> 35:09.472
Kids, kids. Come on.

35:42.223 --> 35:45.387
Well, I gotta say,
you tidied the place up real good.

35:45.477 --> 35:47.719
Heard some chatter on the walkies earlier.

35:47.812 --> 35:50.771
Victor told me about the little stunt
you were trying to pull.

35:50.857 --> 35:54.021
I hope you're not still thinking of
one last hurrah, are you, Morgan?

35:55.195 --> 35:56.231
No.

35:57.489 --> 36:01.108
We asked for your help,
and we're gonna take it.

36:02.077 --> 36:04.239
Good. That's grand.

36:04.329 --> 36:06.537
But you are gonna have to take all of us.

36:07.415 --> 36:11.375
That means Grace, our elders,
our sick, and our injured.

36:11.461 --> 36:14.625
And whatever health care they need,
you're gonna give it to them.

36:16.841 --> 36:18.002
See, it's all of us.

36:19.010 --> 36:20.376
It's all of us or none of us.

36:21.262 --> 36:22.628
Look at you.

36:23.598 --> 36:26.762
You are in no position
to be making demands.

36:26.851 --> 36:29.264
You don't get sauce on the side
in a soup kitchen.

36:30.438 --> 36:32.521
Well, you won. You did.

36:34.275 --> 36:35.857
You should let us win, too.

36:36.695 --> 36:40.439
You're all about value.
Well, all of us alive...

36:40.532 --> 36:43.821
I would argue
that we're priceless to you like that.

36:44.911 --> 36:46.243
And anything else...

36:47.330 --> 36:49.117
it's gonna be a problem.

36:50.166 --> 36:53.079
'Cause the only way this is gonna work
is if we get a guarantee

36:53.169 --> 36:56.458
that we will not lose a single one of us,
not one.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.086
Otherwise...

37:02.762 --> 37:04.298
Well, then we'll both lose.

37:22.615 --> 37:24.197
Goddam it. Fine.

37:25.201 --> 37:27.238
Guess it's worth
saving a few bullets over.

37:30.290 --> 37:32.998
Well, come on.
Get the rest of your people out here.

37:33.084 --> 37:34.575
We got a long drive ahead of us.

37:37.380 --> 37:40.248
<i>Adios</i> yesterday, hello tomorrow.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.563
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

38:07.869 --> 38:09.485
Go. Go.

38:10.997 --> 38:11.997
Here we go.

38:14.834 --> 38:16.621
Boys, move out!

38:20.924 --> 38:23.416
Gonna get a lot of use out of this beauty.

38:23.510 --> 38:26.344
Not if you can't drive it.
Van can be a bitch.

38:26.429 --> 38:28.591
Breaks down more than you'd think.

38:28.681 --> 38:31.515
Look, I could keep it running.
Just keep some of these people together.

38:31.601 --> 38:35.060
I got a mechanic over at the Lanes.
Used to have a garage before.

38:36.272 --> 38:37.272
Come on, now, Al.

38:37.357 --> 38:39.752
You think I'd drive it off the lot
without an extended warranty?

38:39.776 --> 38:40.937
I know why you're doing this.

38:41.027 --> 38:43.440
You think if people get too close,
it gets in the way.

38:44.113 --> 38:46.821
And maybe you're right.
But you have another problem.

38:46.908 --> 38:49.070
You've rigged the game.
It's all built on a lie.

38:50.078 --> 38:51.114
Can't last.

38:52.163 --> 38:53.745
It's not a lie, Al.

38:55.124 --> 38:56.490
You'll see.

38:57.335 --> 38:58.871
And speaking of the truth,

38:58.962 --> 39:00.648
I'm gonna need you to tell me
everything you know

39:00.672 --> 39:02.664
about that helicopter you mentioned.

39:06.886 --> 39:10.345
Hey, sis, if she asks you to brew,
make sure to make it extra swilly.

39:11.266 --> 39:14.009
I said I was never gonna
leave anyone in my rear-view again,

39:14.102 --> 39:16.469
and I sure as shit
am not gonna break that promise.

39:16.563 --> 39:18.771
Not with you. Not because of her!

39:33.413 --> 39:36.030
Is Daniel right?
Are you helping with the MRAP?

39:36.124 --> 39:37.956
I needed to curry favour with her.

39:38.042 --> 39:39.283
We'll be fine.

39:40.461 --> 39:42.168
We can do more damage from the inside.

39:46.134 --> 39:48.626
Keep it. She's gonna need it.

39:51.014 --> 39:52.300
Come on.

39:54.809 --> 39:57.017
Victor, why did you give her the starter?

40:00.231 --> 40:02.018
Remember who you are in there.

40:09.574 --> 40:10.574
Daniel!

40:14.746 --> 40:18.080
Everything's gonna be fine.
I will find a way to get to you.

40:19.709 --> 40:22.292
I will... <i>will</i> find you.

40:23.129 --> 40:26.167
Okay? Just keep practising.

40:26.257 --> 40:27.714
No, but I...

40:27.800 --> 40:28.986
You have to go. You have to go.

40:29.010 --> 40:30.171
- Please.
- You have to go.

40:35.141 --> 40:36.222
Hey!

40:38.227 --> 40:39.263
That's my cat.

40:40.730 --> 40:42.517
The cat and I travel together.

40:43.608 --> 40:46.772
Not any more you don't.
Now, get in the truck.

41:22.105 --> 41:23.105
Al gave this to me.

41:25.483 --> 41:26.483
You should have it.

41:29.028 --> 41:30.394
For movie night.

41:31.406 --> 41:32.406
Yeah.

41:33.616 --> 41:35.983
We're gonna find our way
back to each other.

41:36.828 --> 41:37.828
I know.

41:39.706 --> 41:40.706
All right, come on.

41:41.290 --> 41:44.374
All right, baby.
We're gonna find each other again.

41:47.130 --> 41:49.417
Hang on. You take this.

41:50.800 --> 41:53.964
Ignore the "I'm sorry" part.
I'm not sorry about a single moment.

41:55.054 --> 41:57.922
We're all right! I love you. I love you.

41:58.891 --> 42:00.098
All right, okay.

42:02.562 --> 42:03.562
I love you.

42:17.910 --> 42:20.277
Let's go! Come on! Get in the car!

42:48.399 --> 42:50.641
They will take care of you
in ways that we just couldn't.

42:51.736 --> 42:55.400
I can't explain it, but after today...

42:57.533 --> 43:00.742
somehow it doesn't feel like
the beginning of the end.

43:00.828 --> 43:02.990
Okay. Go ahead
and let me say this, and then...

43:03.915 --> 43:05.601
Because I don't know
what's gonna happen to us,

43:05.625 --> 43:08.993
but at the mall, you know,
on the carousel with you,

43:09.087 --> 43:10.453
I felt something.

43:11.589 --> 43:13.317
And it scared me.
It scared the hell outta me.

43:13.341 --> 43:16.834
Because I've only ever felt that
one other time, and that was with Jenny.

43:16.928 --> 43:19.215
And maybe this is something different,

43:19.305 --> 43:23.049
or maybe it's the same thing
that I had with her, but I felt it.

43:25.061 --> 43:28.680
And I felt the possibility of it.
I felt like it was more.

43:28.773 --> 43:31.607
And whatever happens to us
and wherever we end up,

43:31.692 --> 43:33.684
I need you to know that.

43:36.280 --> 43:38.647
Okay? Okay?

43:39.367 --> 43:40.367
Okay.

43:42.453 --> 43:43.453
Grace.

43:48.793 --> 43:50.580
This is Doc Holt.

43:50.670 --> 43:53.879
His background's family medicine,
but he did a rotation in oncology.

43:55.550 --> 43:57.132
Is that what you had in mind, Morgan?

43:58.761 --> 44:00.093
I appreciate it.

44:03.975 --> 44:07.434
I felt it too, Morgan.
I need you to know that.

44:08.688 --> 44:10.099
I need you to know that.

45:11.792 --> 45:12.953
You ready?

45:15.129 --> 45:16.586
Where are you taking me?

45:16.672 --> 45:18.459
You get to stay here, Morgan.

45:19.508 --> 45:22.216
You see? Gotta protect the future.

45:23.429 --> 45:26.012
Which is why
I am loathe to repeat the past.

45:28.351 --> 45:29.762
You don't have to do this.

45:31.354 --> 45:32.354
I do.

47:35.061 --> 47:37.599
I just resent your face so much.

47:51.243 --> 47:53.326
<i>Virginia, do you copy?</i>

47:54.997 --> 47:56.283
What?

47:56.374 --> 47:59.663
<i>- It's the patient.</i>
- How sick is she?

48:02.004 --> 48:03.085
Don't hurt her.

48:03.172 --> 48:04.879
However bad it is...

48:06.967 --> 48:08.174
please don't hurt her.

48:08.886 --> 48:11.594
<i>She's not sick. She's pregnant.</i>

48:21.357 --> 48:22.723
How far along?

48:23.401 --> 48:24.767
<i>Hard to tell.</i>

48:24.860 --> 48:28.228
Three, four months maybe.
She's malnourished.

48:29.573 --> 48:31.189
I'll meet you at the lodge.

48:32.368 --> 48:34.360
You would've left her out there to die.

48:38.541 --> 48:41.534
You said what we were doing out here
had no future to it.

48:43.671 --> 48:44.832
Had no future.

48:47.800 --> 48:49.132
And you were wrong.

49:00.563 --> 49:02.145
I do hope you die.

49:03.524 --> 49:06.642
But that's not the point any more.
I hope you heard me.

49:29.675 --> 49:31.382
If any of you are listening...

49:32.261 --> 49:33.718
if any of you can hear me...

49:34.638 --> 49:37.972
what we were doing out here... it was...

49:39.185 --> 49:41.393
it wasn't just about doing right.

49:45.483 --> 49:46.940
It was about the future.

49:49.153 --> 49:50.564
We...

49:54.533 --> 49:56.991
We... fought...

49:58.871 --> 50:00.237
for the future.

50:06.545 --> 50:08.161
We made the hard call.

50:11.550 --> 50:12.631
For her.

50:16.180 --> 50:18.547
For... For all of us.

50:24.647 --> 50:28.857
So, Grace, if you're listening to me...

50:33.405 --> 50:34.441
live.

50:39.828 --> 50:41.194
All of you...

50:43.374 --> 50:44.910
if you can hear me...

50:49.505 --> 50:50.712
just live.
