# Sarah and Duck
QUACK!

00:03.920 --> 00:06.120
# Sarah and Duck
QUACK!

00:07.240 --> 00:08.840
# Sarah and Duck

00:08.840 --> 00:11.200
QUACK!

00:11.200 --> 00:13.400
# Sarah and Duck. #
QUACK!

00:15.880 --> 00:19.040
Today, Sarah and Duck are
taking Umbrella

00:19.040 --> 00:23.000
on his first-ever bus ride
to the Big Shop.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.800
Ooh. It's like flying.

00:25.800 --> 00:27.000
Woohoo!

00:27.000 --> 00:29.080
Whoo, whoo!

00:30.520 --> 00:32.800
SHE CHUCKLES
Floaty Duck.

00:34.280 --> 00:36.600
BUS DRIVER: This stop, Big Shop.

00:37.680 --> 00:38.880
We're here.

00:38.880 --> 00:41.040
We'd better get off.
QUACK!

00:43.680 --> 00:46.440
Phew. That was close.

00:46.440 --> 00:48.600
Umbrella, the Big Shop.

00:51.120 --> 00:53.920
Uh, Umbrella?

00:53.920 --> 00:55.920
He's still on the bus!

00:55.920 --> 00:58.080
Oh, no!
QUACK-QUACK!

00:58.080 --> 00:59.800
Um, it's OK.

00:59.800 --> 01:02.960
I'm sure we can just ask
the next driver,

01:02.960 --> 01:04.760
they'll know what to do.

01:10.480 --> 01:12.400
Ah, here we are.

01:13.800 --> 01:16.640
Excuse me,
our umbrella stayed on the bus.

01:16.640 --> 01:20.840
Not to worry. Anyone left onboard
gets dropped off at the depot.

01:20.840 --> 01:23.480
Take a seat,
I'm on my way there now.

01:23.480 --> 01:26.280
Thank you.
QUACK!

01:26.280 --> 01:29.520
You aren't the first to leave
an umbrella on the bus.

01:29.520 --> 01:32.440
They just get a bit too
distracted by the view.

01:32.440 --> 01:34.320
SHE SIGHS

01:46.400 --> 01:49.640
BUS DRIVER: Final stop,
bus depot.

01:50.760 --> 01:52.680
This way, please.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.080
Oh!

01:55.200 --> 01:58.360
We've had so many lost umbrellas
turn up here.

01:58.360 --> 02:01.040
We decided to give them
something to do.

02:01.040 --> 02:02.960
Oooh!
QUACK!

02:02.960 --> 02:05.600
We call it the Umbrella Stand.

02:05.600 --> 02:09.280
It's a rumpus room for lost
umbrellas to amuse themselves

02:09.280 --> 02:11.720
until their friends pick them up.

02:11.720 --> 02:15.360
He'll be in there somewhere.

02:15.360 --> 02:18.160
Good luck. OK, thank you.

02:18.160 --> 02:21.120
Well, we'd better get looking.
Uh-huh.

02:23.920 --> 02:27.800
CHATTERING AND LAUGHTER
BALL SQUEAKS

02:27.800 --> 02:29.280
SHE GASPS

02:29.280 --> 02:30.760
My word!

02:32.960 --> 02:34.880
Um, Umbrella?

02:34.880 --> 02:36.600
CHATTERING STOPS

02:36.600 --> 02:38.520
Huh?

02:38.520 --> 02:40.120
SHE CHUCKLES

02:40.120 --> 02:44.960
I think that's quite a
common name for an umbrella.

02:48.680 --> 02:50.240
RIBBIT!

02:50.240 --> 02:52.560
QUACK!

02:52.560 --> 02:53.760
RIBBIT!

02:53.760 --> 02:54.760
QUACK!

02:54.760 --> 02:58.720
Ah, looks like you made a
friend there, chap.

02:58.720 --> 02:59.920
Hello.

02:59.920 --> 03:02.800
Uh, have you seen our friend?

03:02.800 --> 03:04.120
He's red.

03:05.720 --> 03:10.200
He doesn't like rain
and he does magic.

03:10.200 --> 03:11.880
Magic umbrella!

03:11.880 --> 03:15.120
He tried to magic away
all the balls.

03:15.120 --> 03:19.960
But he just hid some in his canopy
and hopped upstairs.

03:19.960 --> 03:23.360
Well, seems we'll have
to find a way through.

03:23.360 --> 03:24.560
Uh-huh.

03:26.040 --> 03:28.040
CHATTERING AND LAUGHTER

03:28.040 --> 03:29.680
Um...

03:29.680 --> 03:31.720
excuse me, please.

03:31.720 --> 03:33.680
RIBBIT!

03:33.680 --> 03:35.600
Follow me, OK?

03:37.040 --> 03:38.480
OK.

03:45.320 --> 03:46.600
Whoa!

03:54.840 --> 03:56.600
SHE GROANS

03:56.600 --> 03:58.200
Up and over!

04:00.160 --> 04:01.440
Nearly there.

04:02.640 --> 04:04.840
Boo!
QUACK!

04:06.560 --> 04:09.280
We made it! Good one, brelly.

04:09.280 --> 04:10.840
I am a good brelly.

04:10.840 --> 04:12.400
BRELLY QUACKS

04:12.400 --> 04:15.960
Looks like she's coming with us.
SARAH CHUCKLES

04:18.760 --> 04:20.040
Ooh.

04:21.520 --> 04:24.520
Well, Umbrella does like dancing,

04:24.520 --> 04:27.160
maybe he's here. Hmm.

04:28.160 --> 04:30.120
Oh! Look, Duck.

04:30.120 --> 04:34.240
That must be one of the balls
Umbrella tried to magic away.

04:36.680 --> 04:38.200
What's this now?

04:38.200 --> 04:41.040
Um, have you seen our friend?

04:41.040 --> 04:42.520
He's red.

04:42.520 --> 04:43.880
Right.

04:43.880 --> 04:48.480
Um... He doesn't like rain,
does magic and...

04:48.480 --> 04:51.000
likes to spin.
Plenty of spinners about,

04:51.000 --> 04:53.440
but you'll have to spin your
way through

04:53.440 --> 04:57.480
if you want to find him.
It's the only way to move here.

04:57.480 --> 04:59.240
QUACK!
Whee!

04:59.240 --> 05:01.560
Looks like Duck's got the
right idea.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.000
Uh-huh.

05:04.800 --> 05:07.800
SHE GROANS

05:09.200 --> 05:11.840
Can't see Umbrella.

05:11.840 --> 05:14.960
BRELLY LAUGHS
I'm not sure he's here.

05:14.960 --> 05:16.720
No.

05:16.720 --> 05:19.880
Well, the only way is up.

05:19.880 --> 05:21.080
Yep.

05:24.280 --> 05:25.640
Ooh.

05:27.640 --> 05:30.800
THEY SNORE

05:32.960 --> 05:35.680
QUACK!
Shh, Duck!

05:35.680 --> 05:38.360
The umbrellas are sleeping.

05:38.360 --> 05:40.560
But which one is our umbrella?

05:40.560 --> 05:43.440
It's too dark to tell them apart.

05:43.440 --> 05:44.880
Hmm.

05:46.600 --> 05:49.200
Switch on the lights, OK?

05:51.360 --> 05:54.240
Press the button.
QUACK!

05:58.120 --> 06:00.120
Oh, good one, Duck.

06:00.120 --> 06:01.360
Bravo.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.560
Green! Oh, yeah.

06:08.600 --> 06:11.000
There, red!

06:11.000 --> 06:13.600
Umbrella!

06:13.600 --> 06:15.160
Oh, hello!

06:15.160 --> 06:17.520
Um... Sorry we lost you.

06:17.520 --> 06:19.800
Umbrella, sorry we lost you.

06:19.800 --> 06:21.320
What took you so long?

06:21.320 --> 06:23.560
I've been spinning and got pyjamas

06:23.560 --> 06:25.240
and had the best day!

06:25.240 --> 06:27.240
The Big Shop is the best!

06:27.240 --> 06:28.840
Can we stay a bit longer?

06:28.840 --> 06:30.600
Can we? Can we?

06:30.600 --> 06:31.720
Um...

06:31.720 --> 06:34.520
This isn't the Big Shop.

06:34.520 --> 06:35.800
Oh.

06:35.800 --> 06:37.280
Uh...

06:37.280 --> 06:39.120
Can we come again anyway?

06:39.120 --> 06:40.920
I don't see why not.

06:40.920 --> 06:42.400
Yes.

06:42.400 --> 06:43.440
Yes!

06:45.320 --> 06:48.800
# Sarah and Duck

06:48.800 --> 06:52.320
# Sarah and Duck

06:52.320 --> 06:55.920
# Sarah and Duck
Sarah and Duck. #
