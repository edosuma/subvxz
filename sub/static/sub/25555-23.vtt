00:01.502 --> 00:03.736
Previously on
"Floribama Shore..."

00:03.804 --> 00:04.903
Beer or vodka?

00:04.972 --> 00:06.805
Carey is actually normal,

00:06.874 --> 00:08.640
and I'm not trying
to scare him off.

00:08.709 --> 00:11.010
So, definitely
taking things slow.

00:12.213 --> 00:13.212
(Jerry Butts)
<i> Me and Mom thought</i>

00:13.280 --> 00:14.780
<i> we might just</i>
<i> ride down tomorrow.</i>

00:14.849 --> 00:16.982
My mom and dad,
the Buttses,

00:17.051 --> 00:19.785
are coming to visit
Panama City Beach.

00:19.854 --> 00:21.220
It's so good
to see y'all.

00:21.288 --> 00:22.654
(men)
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

00:22.723 --> 00:24.423
(Jeremiah)
To the Butts!

00:24.492 --> 00:25.691
(laughing)

00:25.760 --> 00:28.127
So, if Codi
asked you out,

00:28.195 --> 00:29.461
you'd be willing to go?

00:32.199 --> 00:34.266
(Jeremiah)
Welcome to Panama City Beach!

And the people that
bought us these shots!

00:59.527 --> 01:02.061
(Codi)
Good?

01:02.129 --> 01:03.862
That sumbitch
nasty as (bleep).

01:05.833 --> 01:08.167
Y'all gonna see me passed out
over there on the table.

01:08.235 --> 01:09.501
Hell, I'm gonna
pass out with you.

01:09.570 --> 01:11.403
(Kirk)
Codi's puking and
rallying right now.

01:11.472 --> 01:13.939
What the hell's wrong with him?
(Lisa)
I might be right
there with him.

01:14.008 --> 01:15.808
We trained him
better than that.

01:15.876 --> 01:17.176
(Kirk)
It's all starting to make sense

01:17.244 --> 01:19.978
of why Codi is the way he is
after meeting him parents.

01:20.047 --> 01:22.047
To mold and tame
a wild Codi,

01:22.116 --> 01:23.215
you gotta be
some type of crazy.

01:23.284 --> 01:25.417
Is he all right?
Is he gonna make it?
Yeah.

01:25.486 --> 01:26.685
Yeah, he's cleaning up
right now.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.253
I'm getting him a drink
to settle that (bleep).

01:28.322 --> 01:29.788
Oh, Lord,
bless him.

01:29.857 --> 01:32.191
So, you-- so you think
you'll hook up with Codi?

01:32.259 --> 01:34.960
I don't-- listen,
I don't know.

01:35.029 --> 01:37.596
Codi asked me on a date,
and at that time

01:37.665 --> 01:40.866
I was in a relationship,
and so I told him no.

01:40.935 --> 01:42.734
So, you're not in
a relationship now?

01:42.803 --> 01:44.002
No.

01:44.071 --> 01:47.639
So, Codi ask you out,
you'll be willing to go?

01:47.708 --> 01:49.208
Yeah.

01:49.276 --> 01:50.809
I would go out with him,
yes, I would.

01:50.878 --> 01:52.578
I think Codi
is a great guy.

01:52.646 --> 01:55.581
Puke and rally, baby.
Puke and rally king is back.

01:55.649 --> 01:57.749
Hey, you back?
Are you back, bitch?

01:57.818 --> 01:58.917
I'm back, baby, I'm back.

01:58.986 --> 02:02.588
(cheering)
(Jeremiah)
Codi! Codi!

02:02.656 --> 02:05.124
I'm just saying,
he is looking

02:05.192 --> 02:08.627
for something really special.

02:08.696 --> 02:11.797
(Candace)
Codi obviously
talked to his parents,

02:11.866 --> 02:14.199
and so, maybe he actually
really does like me.

02:14.268 --> 02:17.636
So, I just-- I just
wanna know how you feel.

02:17.705 --> 02:20.839
I'm not closed off to anything,
so you never know.

02:20.908 --> 02:23.842
Well, I've loved you from
the first night we talked.

02:23.911 --> 02:26.111
Oh, he know
I love you.
Yeah.

02:26.180 --> 02:28.780
Yeah, I loved you from--
Lookie here, lookie here.

02:28.849 --> 02:31.483
My dad is champion
of the wing men.

02:31.552 --> 02:34.419
He's just gotta get
his (bleep) together.
He do.

02:34.488 --> 02:37.256
My eyes are set on Candace
and only Candace.

02:37.324 --> 02:38.824
I feel like that cartoon

02:38.893 --> 02:40.993
where your eyes
just pop out as hearts.

02:41.061 --> 02:43.162
(chuckles)

02:43.230 --> 02:44.930
(Candace)
Mr. Jerry definitely pushed it.

02:44.999 --> 02:46.098
He pushed it a lot.

02:57.278 --> 03:01.380
Codi's parents
can (bleep) hang.

03:01.448 --> 03:03.115
After a day of partying
with the Butts,

03:03.184 --> 03:04.850
we are all a little drunk.

03:06.253 --> 03:08.020
But we going
to No Name though.

03:10.824 --> 03:13.192
(Jeremiah)
Mama Butts
is in the house!

03:13.260 --> 03:15.594
(Gus)
Bar hopping with the Butts.
(Codi)
That's right.

03:18.566 --> 03:21.833
(Kortni)
Oh my God,
I can smell my feet.

03:21.902 --> 03:24.236
My feet stink
like (bleep).

03:24.305 --> 03:26.605
Normally, whenever you meet
a set of parents,

03:26.674 --> 03:28.207
you need to be on
your best behavior.

03:28.275 --> 03:29.474
But for the Butts,

03:29.543 --> 03:32.110
they love everyone
for who they are.

03:32.179 --> 03:34.112
I'm sure we can find
two extra twin-size beds

03:34.181 --> 03:36.215
around here somewhere for them
to just stay with us.

03:36.283 --> 03:37.216
Oh, Codi, here,
I'll get up.
No, no, baby.

03:37.284 --> 03:39.218
No, no, no,
sit right there.

03:39.286 --> 03:41.353
I can sit down here,
I can sit down here.

03:41.422 --> 03:43.622
No, but I want him to sit
next to his parents.
Yeah.

03:43.691 --> 03:45.257
I'm fine.
Hey.

03:45.326 --> 03:47.859
We could be your parents
one day, who knows?

03:47.928 --> 03:49.194
(laughs)

03:49.263 --> 03:51.830
I love Jerry and Lisa.
I love y'all.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.599
I love this woman.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.767
Oh, you so sweet.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.069
(all)
Aww!

03:57.137 --> 03:58.704
Mr. Jerry,
how did y'all meet?

03:58.772 --> 04:01.306
Please say at a bar,
so we'll feel better.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.408
Well, that's pretty much
what happened.

04:03.477 --> 04:04.910
(laughter)

04:04.979 --> 04:06.044
(Nilsa)
Thank God, thank God,
that gives me hope.

04:06.113 --> 04:08.847
Thank you, Jesus!
I will find my soulmate.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.816
And I want it all
for y'all.

04:10.884 --> 04:12.818
That's what I told Codi,
I said, son,

04:12.886 --> 04:14.119
don't never give up.

04:14.188 --> 04:15.887
I wanna be in love.

04:15.956 --> 04:18.156
I hope to God that
I can find a relationship

04:18.225 --> 04:20.058
like my mom and dad have.

04:20.127 --> 04:21.893
I want that so much.

04:21.962 --> 04:24.496
The difference between
his dad and my dad,

04:24.565 --> 04:27.199
it's just--
it still baffles me.

04:27.268 --> 04:28.800
Why don't we meet him?

04:28.869 --> 04:30.769
Maybe one day.
Maybe one day.

04:30.838 --> 04:33.105
It ain't nothing like this.
It ain't nothing like this.

04:33.173 --> 04:34.339
(Gus)
You know, sitting there
and talking to the Butts,

04:34.408 --> 04:35.907
obviously, they have
a great sense of humor,

04:35.976 --> 04:37.042
they know how to have
a good time.

04:37.111 --> 04:39.111
But I've never even
cracked open a beer

04:39.179 --> 04:40.545
with my pops before, nothing.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.914
And so, seeing Codi
and his dad sitting there

04:42.983 --> 04:45.284
just throwing beers back,
I don't know how to take it in.

04:45.352 --> 04:47.085
I just didn't know that parents
actually had that type

04:47.154 --> 04:48.353
of relationships
with their kids.

04:48.422 --> 04:50.222
The thot-mobiles
are here!

04:50.291 --> 04:52.791
Wait, hold on,
three Butts going down a ramp.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.293
I know this joke.

04:54.361 --> 04:55.761
We decided to leave the bar.

04:55.829 --> 04:58.397
So, my mom and dad obviously
don't wanna go home yet.

04:58.465 --> 04:59.898
(Gus)
You can jump in the cab
with us this time.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.433
We won't put you through
that torture again.

05:01.502 --> 05:04.503
Yeah, that was awful.
(laughs)

05:04.571 --> 05:06.738
We're gonna take this party
back to the house.

05:06.807 --> 05:10.509
Listen, all I wanna say
is I love y'all bitches!

05:10.577 --> 05:12.577
(laughter)
Yeah!

05:14.448 --> 05:16.214
(exaggerated)
Bitches!

05:16.283 --> 05:19.451
(indistinct chatter
and laughter)

05:19.520 --> 05:20.752
(Gus)
You know, looking at the way

05:20.821 --> 05:23.455
Codi's parents are with him
and how he was raised,

05:23.524 --> 05:25.757
I just kinda wish
I had the same thing.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.059
(Gus)
Let's go get a beer.

05:27.127 --> 05:29.061
(Codi)
Yeah, let's get some beer.

05:30.564 --> 05:31.997
(Kirk)
Y'all don't understand
how thankful we are

05:32.066 --> 05:33.031
for y'all to come.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.233
We have enjoyed it.
I'm glad.

05:35.302 --> 05:37.135
We enjoyed it more.

05:37.204 --> 05:40.672
Y'all guys has got
a family here.

05:40.741 --> 05:41.973
Yep.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.542
(Codi)
I'd never in a million years

05:43.610 --> 05:47.312
thought that I would be
as close as I am with him

05:47.381 --> 05:49.281
and with him.

05:49.350 --> 05:50.849
But you know what?

05:50.918 --> 05:52.184
You see where
we stand now.

05:52.252 --> 05:53.785
I'm grateful for that.
I am...

05:53.854 --> 05:55.354
And I'll do anything
for y'all.

05:55.422 --> 05:57.889
Likewise, brother.
Likewise, dude.

05:57.958 --> 06:00.025
And that's one thing
that him and her

06:00.094 --> 06:01.593
has instilled in my life.

06:01.662 --> 06:03.762
That's what it's all about,
seriously.

06:03.831 --> 06:05.564
It's just, like, so weird
for me to, like,

06:05.632 --> 06:07.099
see how you guys
are together.

06:07.167 --> 06:09.167
And like, it's hard for me
to talk about, I'm sorry,

06:09.236 --> 06:10.168
but it's like,
it's hard to see that

06:10.237 --> 06:12.838
'cause I ain't never
seen that, man.

06:12.906 --> 06:14.706
It kinda opened my eyes to,
you know,

06:14.775 --> 06:16.508
how a relationship's
supposed to be with your kids,

06:16.577 --> 06:19.044
how, you know, a husband's
supposed to love his wife.

06:19.113 --> 06:21.113
Because I grew up seeing
my parents fight a lot.

06:21.181 --> 06:22.647
I love my mom
and dad to death,

06:22.716 --> 06:24.383
but honestly,
they were toxic to each other.

06:24.451 --> 06:25.884
So, I'm trying to get
to the point

06:25.953 --> 06:27.285
where everything is,
you know, all beautiful,

06:27.354 --> 06:28.920
and rainbows and butterflies.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.589
But there's still a lot
of emotional damage

06:30.657 --> 06:31.690
that comes along with that.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.959
It's just not--
it's not like that with mine.

06:34.027 --> 06:36.128
Like, after last summer
or whatever,

06:36.196 --> 06:39.030
like, I was-- I was told
I was a bad name on the family.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.766
(Jerry)
That's crazy.
And I can be
a witness to that.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.034
Yeah, like I was-- like,
Jeremiah came to the house,

06:43.103 --> 06:45.404
and he heard him say,
"That's not the son I raised."

06:45.472 --> 06:47.105
And that's just
(bleep) crushing, man.

06:47.174 --> 06:50.776
I completely understand
why Gus gets so emotional,

06:50.844 --> 06:53.044
why he gets so upset.

06:53.113 --> 06:56.782
Because all a child
ever wants in life

06:56.850 --> 06:59.217
is to have somebody
to be proud of them.

06:59.286 --> 07:02.053
If I was your father...

07:02.122 --> 07:03.855
I would be so proud.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.657
Yeah, and that's all I've ever
wanted to hear, you know?

07:05.726 --> 07:06.658
So proud.

07:09.296 --> 07:11.696
I'm gonna tell you right now,
and y'all can say

07:11.765 --> 07:13.198
what the (bleep)
y'all wanna say.

07:13.267 --> 07:14.666
That son of a bitch
right there

07:14.735 --> 07:17.702
is the nicest, kindest,

07:17.771 --> 07:21.640
most genuine person
I have ever met in my life.

07:21.708 --> 07:23.041
Y'all don't understand, bro.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.042
Y'all don't understand
some of the things

07:24.111 --> 07:25.243
that go on in my head.

07:25.312 --> 07:27.579
I feel like that
(bleep) black sheep,

07:27.648 --> 07:29.981
and I've always felt like that
in my family.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.617
Even though I'm not
even a bad kid, man.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.789
(Kirk)
Coming up...

07:37.858 --> 07:39.891
What do you say just us
go out to get some wings?

07:39.960 --> 07:41.960
I want you to know
how to be treated on a date.

07:42.029 --> 07:45.197
(Nilsa)
Kortni's the make out
queen tonight.

07:45.265 --> 07:47.232
Bitch!
Whoa! Whoa!

07:47.301 --> 07:48.333
(man)
There was an altercation

07:48.402 --> 07:49.868
at Newby's back there.

07:49.937 --> 07:52.037
(Aimee)
This girl has called the cops.

07:52.105 --> 07:53.505
Here we (bleep) go.

08:00.948 --> 08:04.249
And it's all about accepting,
man, like, just acceptance
in general.

08:04.318 --> 08:06.051
You gotta accept your kid--
You just want your
parents to accept you.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.986
Like, Codi can be who he is,

08:08.055 --> 08:09.654
he doesn't have to hide that
from you guys,

08:09.723 --> 08:11.356
because you guys
know who he is.
(Jerry)
Yeah.

08:11.425 --> 08:12.891
You raised him,
you accept that to the fullest.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.493
Like, when I'm,
you know, back home,

08:14.561 --> 08:15.760
I can't act like myself.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.195
(Gus)
When I was growing up,

08:17.264 --> 08:19.397
me and my dad weren't
necessarily best friends.

08:19.466 --> 08:21.433
It was more like he was there
to discipline me

08:21.502 --> 08:23.235
and teach me the way
that I need to be in life.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.370
But at this point,
the parenting stage is over.

08:25.439 --> 08:27.405
You know, once you hit 18
or whatever,

08:27.474 --> 08:28.807
what you do in life
is up to you.

08:28.876 --> 08:30.408
And that's something
I've always struggled with

08:30.477 --> 08:31.710
because I'm scared of what
my parents might think.

08:31.778 --> 08:34.212
Like, I went so long
without actually having,

08:34.281 --> 08:35.614
like, my family
there for me,

08:35.682 --> 08:38.016
that I knew, like,
I wanted this, what y'all have,

08:38.085 --> 08:39.217
because I know that's where
happiness comes from.

08:39.286 --> 08:41.953
What I wanted
out of this whole experience

08:42.022 --> 08:44.289
is to gain family,
which I've gained

08:44.358 --> 08:46.057
through everybody
in this house.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.492
But I'ma tell you
something, man.

08:47.561 --> 08:49.127
You need somebody...
Yeah.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.463
you (bleep) got us.
I know that now.

08:51.532 --> 08:53.331
You got us.
Y'all a phone call away.

08:53.400 --> 08:54.966
I know that.
You damn right.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.434
I don't want y'all to think
that I just had

08:56.503 --> 08:58.403
like the worst parents
or anything like that
though, because I--

08:58.472 --> 09:00.772
No, no, we don't.
No, I don't want
anybody to think that.

09:00.841 --> 09:02.607
No, we don't.
Like, that's the other
side of the spectrum.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.776
Because I love my mom
and my dad both,

09:04.845 --> 09:06.511
and they did
the best that they could.

09:06.580 --> 09:09.447
(Codi)
Gus really is
the best person I know.

09:09.516 --> 09:11.716
He has such a huge heart.

09:11.785 --> 09:16.187
And I just want his father
to know that...

09:16.256 --> 09:18.290
he should be proud of him.

09:18.358 --> 09:20.692
All right, well listen,
we got to head on...

09:20.761 --> 09:22.627
We'll see you guys again.
Hell yeah, man.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.763
I love you, man.
I love you too, brother.

09:24.831 --> 09:27.065
(Codi)
After a great visit
with my family...

09:27.134 --> 09:28.700
I love you.
Love you too.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.201
Love you too, bitch.

09:30.270 --> 09:31.870
...it's time to say goodbye
to my parents.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.772
I love you, son.
Thank y'all so much

09:33.840 --> 09:34.973
for coming down
to see me.

09:35.042 --> 09:37.142
I love everybody.
Y'all don't understand

09:37.210 --> 09:38.743
how much it meant.
Love you.

09:38.812 --> 09:40.679
You know, we're coming
to the end of the summer,

09:40.747 --> 09:42.247
and this has just made it
for me.

09:42.316 --> 09:45.116
It is so hard saying goodbye.
I don't want them to leave.

09:45.185 --> 09:46.851
Bye, Mom.
Bye, Dad.

09:46.920 --> 09:47.852
Love you.
Love you!

09:47.921 --> 09:49.120

09:55.128 --> 09:57.262

Gus, look at this.

09:57.331 --> 10:01.032
This looks worse,
but this hurts worse.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.034
Look, feel that.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.003
Yeah, it's swole up.
No, feel this.

10:05.072 --> 10:06.571
Watch.

10:06.640 --> 10:07.839
Yeah, it's swole up.

10:07.908 --> 10:09.441
Isn't that crazy?
Yeah.

10:09.509 --> 10:10.475
Aah!

10:10.544 --> 10:11.776
(Gus)
In the middle of the night,

10:11.845 --> 10:14.179
Nilsa happened to take
a tumble down the stairs.

10:14.247 --> 10:15.647
(thudding,
Nilsa screaming)

10:15.716 --> 10:17.349
(laughs)
Oh my God.

10:17.417 --> 10:20.919

You fell down the stairs.

10:20.988 --> 10:21.920

10:21.989 --> 10:24.389
This one hurts the worst.

10:24.458 --> 10:26.391
Yeah, you came down
hard on this.

10:26.460 --> 10:27.425
I didn't see it.

10:27.494 --> 10:28.760
I think she'll just be fine,

10:28.829 --> 10:29.761
she's just gonna have to deal
with the pain--

10:29.830 --> 10:32.397
some pain for a little bit.

10:32.466 --> 10:33.932
Can you make it down
these steps, or no?

10:35.702 --> 10:38.236
I'm scared of stairs.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.105
You know I can just
pick you up, right?

10:40.173 --> 10:43.842
My right leg looks
severely screwed up,

10:43.910 --> 10:46.478
but my left leg feels like
I need to get a pair

10:46.546 --> 10:47.912
of freaking crutches.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.615
And all I've got
is this cane.

10:50.684 --> 10:52.017
Ahh...

10:54.688 --> 10:56.554

more injured at work?

There you go.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.527
How much is workers comp

Another thing, too,
as much as it hurts,

11:05.666 --> 11:07.766
you don't wanna, like,
keep it stiff,
'cause then it stays stiff.
I know.

11:07.834 --> 11:11.903
You gotta, like, walk.
It was stiff when
I woke up this morning.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.004
Ohh...

11:13.073 --> 11:15.373
Gotta walk

11:15.442 --> 11:18.543
I almost died in Mexico,
I get a door slammed in my nose,

11:18.612 --> 11:21.179
and now, I basically have
two bum legs.

Candace a little bit of time

with Gator.

I wanted to take

12:12.499 --> 12:14.265

pregnancy test.

it's something serious, serious.

what done went down?

12:19.306 --> 12:20.405
Nothing, nothing
went down.

What happened?
Nothing went down.

Nobody's pregnant.

why you always--

conclusion like that?

at you for a sec."

We can't go to work.

17:05.658 --> 17:07.425
(laughing)
Can't go to work.

17:07.494 --> 17:09.427
How do you use this?

17:09.496 --> 17:12.497
Who needs an umbrella when
you have grocery store bags?

17:12.565 --> 17:13.598
Okay.

17:13.666 --> 17:14.966
Oh, that's what I should
have done with mine.

17:15.035 --> 17:17.602
(Aimee)
It's so hard to poke
holes in a plastic bag

17:17.670 --> 17:19.937
because it's really hard
to get 'em even.

17:20.006 --> 17:22.407
I wonder how God
got my eyes even.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.510
He did a good job.

17:25.578 --> 17:27.779
(Aimee)
I forgot to wear
underwear today.

17:27.847 --> 17:29.514
(Kortni)
I actually put
some on today.

17:35.989 --> 17:37.522
...yeah, (bleep) that one,
don't (bleep) that one.

17:37.590 --> 17:38.823
You know what I'm saying?
Oh, she's hot, nice ass,

17:38.892 --> 17:40.358
nice tits,
whatever, whatever.

17:40.427 --> 17:41.592
I don't think
that I would help him

17:41.661 --> 17:43.828
choose another girl
to (bleep), Kortni, but...

17:43.897 --> 17:45.296
(Candace)
Y'all, guess what?

17:45.365 --> 17:49.200
Codi brings me out earlier,
and he asked me on a date.

17:49.269 --> 17:51.536
What the...?!

17:51.604 --> 17:53.071
What's wrong with that?

17:53.139 --> 17:56.040
Mr. Butts worked the magic
on Candace.

17:56.109 --> 17:58.042
I think Candace and Codi
would make a good couple

17:58.111 --> 17:59.744
because they're both
good people

17:59.813 --> 18:01.746
and their families
are both hilarious.

18:01.815 --> 18:04.182
I said yes, and so
we're going on a date.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.117
I'm happy, Candace,
I'm really happy for you

18:06.186 --> 18:10.254
because I want a good guy
to take you on a date

18:10.323 --> 18:11.889
to show you how
you're supposed to be treated,

18:11.958 --> 18:13.624
'cause you deserve nothing
but the best.

18:13.693 --> 18:15.927
And what better guy
in the house

18:15.995 --> 18:17.428
to do that than Codi?
Than Codi.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.330
Are you interested in him?
Codi's a great guy.

18:19.399 --> 18:22.166
I'm keeping my--
I'm keeping-- I'm open to it.

18:22.235 --> 18:23.267
So it is, like, legit?

18:23.336 --> 18:25.570
It's legit a date.
Yeah, it's a legit date.

18:25.638 --> 18:26.704
Okay.
I'm so happy.

18:26.773 --> 18:29.640
Y'all just go together,
like stir fry.

18:29.709 --> 18:30.975
(laughs)

18:31.044 --> 18:33.277
Y'all just go all together.
I don't know why, but...

18:33.346 --> 18:34.712
Y'all would be cute.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.281
(Kortni)
I'm actually really happy
and excited for Candace.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.717
She's glowing, she's smiling,
she's being all weird.

18:39.786 --> 18:40.885
It's really cute.

18:40.954 --> 18:43.087
I'm excited though.
Yeah, I'm excited too.

18:43.156 --> 18:44.689
I'm just nervous, y'all,
I'm a little nervous.

18:44.757 --> 18:48.226
'Cause we already
know each other,
you know what I'm saying?

18:48.294 --> 18:51.562
It's just like,
what you talk about after that?

18:51.631 --> 18:52.630
You just keep...
You just, yeah.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.499
continuing to be
your normal self.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.100
That's-- that's why
they always say

18:56.169 --> 18:58.236
friendships always become
the best relationships,

18:58.304 --> 18:59.704
'cause y'all
were friends before.

18:59.772 --> 19:01.806
Yeah.
Yeah, just go out
like y'all are friends.

19:01.875 --> 19:06.477
(phone ringing)

19:06.546 --> 19:07.812
Hello?
<i> Hey, Caleb.</i>

19:07.881 --> 19:08.946
Yo, what's up, Dad?

19:09.015 --> 19:11.215
<i> Just wanna make sure</i>
<i> you're okay.</i>

19:11.284 --> 19:14.585
<i> Just you're heavy</i>
<i> on my heart, that's all.</i>

19:14.654 --> 19:17.288
Yeah, I mean, I'm stressing
a little bit, but...

19:17.357 --> 19:20.858
<i> How come, baby?</i>

19:20.927 --> 19:23.628
(choking)
Yeah, I-- I just have
a hard time talking about it.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.596
<i> I'm concerned for you.</i>

19:25.665 --> 19:27.932
<i> You know, all this</i>
<i> running around and...</i>

19:28.001 --> 19:30.401
<i> I hope you're keeping</i>
<i> your head on straight.</i>

19:30.470 --> 19:33.504
<i> You know, it's...</i>
Yeah, I'm trying.
I'm trying my best.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.439
(Gus)
Codi's parents
accept him for who he is.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.008
And you know, I still have
my parents telling me

19:37.076 --> 19:38.576
the way I need to act,
the way I need to be,

19:38.645 --> 19:40.378
and that's something
I've always struggled with.

19:40.446 --> 19:44.148
<i> You'll liken it</i>
<i> to live on a diet</i>

19:44.217 --> 19:48.252
<i> for six months on Pepsis</i>
<i> and Snicker bars.</i>

19:48.321 --> 19:49.620
<i> What do you think that's</i>
<i> gonna do to your body?</i>

19:49.689 --> 19:52.957
Yeah.
<i> Likewise with your mind</i>
<i> and your heart.</i>

19:53.026 --> 19:54.559
<i> You know, what you</i>
<i> keep putting in there</i>

19:54.627 --> 19:57.662
<i> and the stuff</i>
<i> you expose yourself to,</i>

19:57.730 --> 19:59.530
<i> it's gonna have an effect</i>
<i> just like that's junk.</i>

19:59.599 --> 20:03.100
Yeah.<i> </i>
<i> So...</i>

20:03.169 --> 20:04.702
<i> I'm anxious</i>
<i> to get you home.</i>

20:04.771 --> 20:07.538
I just want y'all to be proud
of me and not mad.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.073
<i> I'm very proud</i>
<i> of you, Caleb.</i>

20:09.142 --> 20:11.876
<i> I brag on you</i>
<i> everywhere I go.</i>

20:11.945 --> 20:13.311
<i> You have no idea.</i>

20:13.379 --> 20:15.546
<i> I'm gonna say this</i>
<i> and I'm gonna let you go.</i>

20:16.716 --> 20:18.883
<i> But I'm here for you,</i>

20:18.952 --> 20:20.284
<i> and your mama's</i>
<i> here for you.</i>

20:20.353 --> 20:23.421
<i> And just because</i>
<i> we couldn't make it work,</i>

20:23.489 --> 20:25.623
<i> didn't mean we didn't give</i>
<i> y'all everything we could.</i>

20:25.692 --> 20:27.725
<i> You know that.</i>
No, I know that.

20:27.794 --> 20:29.227
<i> Okay.</i>
<i> Just hold your chin up high.</i>

20:29.295 --> 20:30.928
<i> Your mom and I</i>
<i> are proud of you.</i>

20:30.997 --> 20:33.397
Yes, sir.
<i> Me and her are on</i>
<i> the same page on this thing.</i>

20:33.466 --> 20:34.799
Yes, sir.

20:34.867 --> 20:37.535
<i> Now, when you get home,</i>
<i> you need to come see me.</i>

20:40.006 --> 20:41.305
Yes, sir.

20:41.374 --> 20:42.473
<i> Love you, Caleb.</i>

20:42.542 --> 20:43.641
Yes, sir.
Love you too.

20:43.710 --> 20:46.611
Bye.
<i> All right, bye-bye.</i>

20:46.679 --> 20:48.079
(Gus)
I do feel a lot better.

20:48.147 --> 20:49.447
You know, this isn't something
that I can, you know,

20:49.515 --> 20:51.382
snap my fingers
and it's gonna go away.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.384
But hearing my dad tell me this
on the phone now,

20:53.453 --> 20:55.620
this is, you know,
a step towards the future.

20:55.688 --> 20:56.787
You know, no family's perfect.

20:56.856 --> 20:58.756
I do think, you know,
gradually through time,

20:58.825 --> 21:01.025
me and my family are gonna
continue to get better
and better.

21:01.094 --> 21:02.526
Obviously,
their opinion matters,

21:02.595 --> 21:04.595
but this is my life,
it's not theirs,

21:04.664 --> 21:05.896
and I have to do
what's best for me.

21:09.235 --> 21:10.167
(Kirk)
Coming up...

21:10.236 --> 21:11.168
'Cause you being
really nice.

21:11.237 --> 21:13.170
You opening my chair,
my doors.

21:13.239 --> 21:14.305
And like I said,
that's what you get

21:14.374 --> 21:15.606
when you go on a date
with Codi.

21:15.675 --> 21:18.743
Okay, first date.
Potentially many more.
Many more.

21:18.811 --> 21:20.544
Yo, where is Candace
and Codi?

21:20.613 --> 21:21.579
(Kirk)
Hey, I'll tell you
where they are, look.

21:21.648 --> 21:23.814
(Kirk moaning)
No, no, y'all, no.

21:26.786 --> 21:29.520
♪♪

21:32.692 --> 21:34.292
We made it.

21:34.360 --> 21:36.160
Today, I got the date,
y'all, with Candace,

21:36.229 --> 21:39.230
the one I've been trying to get
for months and months now.

21:39.299 --> 21:43.668
I got her some flowers,
her favorite cognac.

21:43.736 --> 21:46.270
I'm excited for it, I can't
wait till she gets off work.

21:46.339 --> 21:48.306
I'm just really anxious.
I am.

21:49.509 --> 21:50.741
That's a terrible heart.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.377
Who knows, this may be
the start of something new.

21:53.446 --> 21:55.246
What's that for?

21:56.516 --> 21:58.649
I may or may not have
a date tonight with Candace.

22:01.220 --> 22:02.753
How'd this happen?

22:02.822 --> 22:04.355
What do you mean,
how'd it happen?
Look at me, baby, (bleep).

22:04.424 --> 22:05.723
I got it going on,
I'm a total package.

22:05.792 --> 22:06.957
(chuckles)

22:07.026 --> 22:08.125
(Kirk)
My first-born, Codi,

22:08.194 --> 22:10.394
finally getting a date
with Candi.

22:10.463 --> 22:12.229
Oh, pimp fried rice.

22:12.298 --> 22:13.698
When'd you ask her?

22:13.766 --> 22:15.132
I asked her
earlier today.

22:15.201 --> 22:16.534
(Kirk)
She's never even been
on a real date before,

22:16.602 --> 22:18.069
and I know Codi's
gonna kill it.

22:18.137 --> 22:20.237
Make her smile
from ear to ear, you know.

22:20.306 --> 22:21.806
Even make her black ass blush,

22:21.874 --> 22:22.940
and black people
can't even blush.

22:23.009 --> 22:24.442
So, let's get it!

22:24.510 --> 22:25.943
(Kirk)
You hear about this?

22:26.012 --> 22:27.345
Him and Candace are going
on a date tonight.

22:27.413 --> 22:28.879
You and Candace
are going on a date?

22:28.948 --> 22:30.448
(Codi)
And I got her a present.

22:30.516 --> 22:32.483
And flowers, he got her
that and flowers.

22:32.552 --> 22:33.751
Oh, let me see the flowers.

22:33.820 --> 22:36.487
(Nilsa)
Codi is going
all out for this date.

22:36.556 --> 22:39.457
He's gotten her flowers,
he's gotten her a gift,

22:39.525 --> 22:41.625
he made a little
sweet note for her.

22:41.694 --> 22:44.228
Guys in the house,
take note from Codi.

22:44.297 --> 22:45.596
What does the note say?

22:45.665 --> 22:47.832
It just says
"Can't wait for tonight.

22:47.900 --> 22:49.133
Hope you enjoy
the flowers."

22:49.202 --> 22:50.835
(gasps)

22:50.903 --> 22:52.303
If she don't wanna go,
I'll go.

22:52.372 --> 22:54.672
This is so cute.

22:54.741 --> 22:56.474
Ooh, maybe we should
make her bed

22:56.542 --> 22:57.575
and then put
the flowers on it.

22:57.643 --> 22:58.642
Yeah.
Yeah, let's do that.

22:58.711 --> 22:59.744
Yeah, you wanna do that?
Okay.

22:59.812 --> 23:01.379
(Kirk)
That is perfect.

23:01.447 --> 23:03.547
That's literally like
it was written in a book.

23:03.616 --> 23:05.383
This is a novel,
this is a love story,

23:05.451 --> 23:06.784
and I love it.

23:06.853 --> 23:10.154
(Nilsa)
That is so sweet, y'all.

23:10.223 --> 23:11.322
Hey, shotgun.

23:11.391 --> 23:12.323
No, let me sit
in the front this time.

23:12.392 --> 23:13.691
(muttering)
No, bitch.

23:13.760 --> 23:14.925
(Kirk)
About to go get ready?

23:14.994 --> 23:16.627
(Codi)
I gotta shower
and (bleep) too.

23:16.696 --> 23:18.062
I feel like y'all
will have fun.

23:18.131 --> 23:19.263
I think so too.

23:19.332 --> 23:20.664
I just hope the food's good
at the place.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.133
We ain't never been there.

23:22.201 --> 23:24.301
You know,
I ain't no Firefly.

23:24.370 --> 23:26.737
You know, I'm like
cold beer.

23:26.806 --> 23:27.938
Yeah.
Some wing-- you know.

23:28.007 --> 23:28.939
And I feel like
that's how she is.

23:29.008 --> 23:30.174
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah.

23:30.243 --> 23:32.910
Don't bust your ass
going up the stairs.

23:32.979 --> 23:35.079
They're wet and slick.

23:35.148 --> 23:36.680
Nilsa would be like,
"Oh my God,

23:36.749 --> 23:38.916
if I'm not going to Firefly,
then I'm not (bleep) going."

23:38.985 --> 23:41.185
That's not--
Are we talking
about dates in here?

23:41.254 --> 23:43.821
Oh!
Maybe.

23:43.890 --> 23:44.989
How was golfing?

23:45.057 --> 23:46.390
It was fun.
Yeah?

23:46.459 --> 23:47.625
It was fun.

23:47.693 --> 23:49.126
Good.
Good.

23:49.195 --> 23:51.762
Hey, Candace.
I brought home-- hey.

23:51.831 --> 23:53.931
So I brought home
a whole bunch of pork

23:54.000 --> 23:55.366
that Kevin gave us
at work.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.641
Like, oh my God!

24:05.912 --> 24:08.879
Yeah!
Go, Codi!

24:08.948 --> 24:11.348
(both giggling)

24:11.417 --> 24:12.883
Codi, what time
are we leaving?

24:12.952 --> 24:14.585
What time you wanna leave?
I gotta take a shower.

24:14.654 --> 24:15.886
I've been golfing today,
so you know, I'm...

24:15.955 --> 24:19.557
I gotta take a shower too.
I've been at work.

24:19.625 --> 24:20.791
Kortni, no,
you gotta stand up.

24:20.860 --> 24:22.326
You're clothing.

24:27.300 --> 24:29.400
(Candace chuckles)
What is this?

24:29.469 --> 24:30.935
(laughing)
Oh my God!

24:33.840 --> 24:36.307
Codi, what time
are we leaving?

24:36.375 --> 24:37.308
(Aimee)
Kortni, no,
you gotta stand up.

24:37.376 --> 24:38.742
You're clothing.

24:43.115 --> 24:47.718
(chuckles)
What is this?

24:47.787 --> 24:49.420
We was just trying
to see your reaction.

24:49.489 --> 24:51.489
(girls laugh)

24:51.557 --> 24:53.057
(Candace laughing)
Oh my God.

24:55.595 --> 24:57.328
Okay...
"Can't wait for tonight.

24:57.396 --> 24:58.796
I hope you enjoy
the flowers."

24:58.865 --> 25:00.731
That's so sweet.
(laughs)

25:00.800 --> 25:02.233
He got me flowers.

25:02.301 --> 25:04.668
Oh my gosh, like,

25:04.737 --> 25:06.770
I ain't never had nobody
do that before.

25:06.839 --> 25:08.672
Well, ain't that spiffy?

25:08.741 --> 25:09.673
Yeah.
I was like, what happened?

25:09.742 --> 25:11.308
He got me some flowers.

25:11.377 --> 25:13.477
(Kirk)
You haven't really gone on
like a traditional date, right?

25:13.546 --> 25:14.478
No, not really.
Oh, I'm excited--

25:14.547 --> 25:15.746
Never?
Yeah!

25:15.815 --> 25:17.047
Nev-- you never been
on a real date?

25:17.116 --> 25:18.482
I mean, I've been on dates,
but you know, like...

25:18.551 --> 25:19.950
But not like-- yeah,
I know what you're saying.

25:20.019 --> 25:21.385
Traditional Southern date.
Not-- nothing like this.

25:21.454 --> 25:22.887
(with Southern accent)
"Can't wait for tonight.

25:22.955 --> 25:25.289
I hope you enjoy the flowers.
Codi."

25:25.358 --> 25:27.024
(laughter)
Now, that's sweet.

25:27.093 --> 25:29.360
You know, we've been living
together for a while now,

25:29.428 --> 25:31.395
but it's so different

25:31.464 --> 25:33.297
now that we, like,
about to go on a real date.

25:33.366 --> 25:36.400
So, I hope the date go good.
And I'm excited.

25:36.469 --> 25:37.835
Gotta figure out
what to wear, y'all.

25:37.904 --> 25:39.937
I don't know what to wear.
Ahh!

25:40.006 --> 25:42.139
First date jitters, ahh!

25:42.208 --> 25:44.275
And he spelled everything
right on the note.

25:44.343 --> 25:47.511
How would you feel if a girl
asked you on a date?

25:47.580 --> 25:50.047
Who asked you on a date?
Huh?

25:50.116 --> 25:51.649
Oh, you're saying
ask a guy on a date.

25:51.717 --> 25:52.983
Okay, my bad.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.785
I have had that happen
plenty of times.

25:54.854 --> 25:56.086
Well, I gotta hear who it is
before I make up my decision.

25:56.155 --> 25:58.155
Carey.
You should.

25:58.224 --> 26:00.024
(Kortni)
I guess it's the 21st century,

26:00.092 --> 26:02.426
so why can't a girl
ask a guy on a date?

26:02.495 --> 26:04.028
It's out of my comfort zone,

26:04.096 --> 26:05.829
but me and Carey
are good friends,

26:05.898 --> 26:07.798
so I don't think it'd be,
like, awkward or anything.

26:07.867 --> 26:09.667
What the hell?
Love done hit this beach house

26:09.735 --> 26:10.668
like a wrecking ball.

26:10.736 --> 26:13.671
♪♪

26:16.108 --> 26:17.041
How's it coming, Candace?

26:17.109 --> 26:18.542
So, I'm gonna
wear this dress.

26:18.611 --> 26:21.745
And then I wanna kinda
make it cute but casual.

26:21.814 --> 26:23.581
So, I'm gonna do
the cowboy hat.

26:23.649 --> 26:25.716
Cheers to a good date.
Cheers, yeah.

26:25.785 --> 26:27.484
Good rest of the summer.
Yeah.

26:33.626 --> 26:35.159
Oh, God.
What's wrong with this guy?

26:35.227 --> 26:38.395
I had to cheers,
I ain't got a drink.
Yes.

26:38.464 --> 26:40.798
You look hot
and your booty looks big.

26:40.866 --> 26:41.966
(Candace)
Ooh, do it?
Mm-hmm.

26:42.034 --> 26:44.301
Where's Kortni?
(Kortni)
Right here.

26:44.370 --> 26:46.136
Can you lotion me up?
I know that's weird.

26:46.205 --> 26:47.638
But, like, can you do it
real quick?

26:47.707 --> 26:51.775
How many thots does it take
to get one thot ready?

26:51.844 --> 26:53.510
(laughs)

26:53.579 --> 26:54.578
(Candace)
I'm a little nervous.

26:54.647 --> 26:56.380
Me and Codi always got
good vibes,

26:56.449 --> 26:58.215
but I don't know
how it's gonna go.

26:58.284 --> 26:59.917
Codi's my roommate,
and we already seen

26:59.986 --> 27:02.019
how Nilsa and Gus went.

27:02.088 --> 27:05.055
(Codi)
So, I did get her a gift.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.256
(Aimee)
You just made
the whole entire date,

27:06.325 --> 27:07.758
just with that bottle.
That's what I'm saying.

27:07.827 --> 27:08.759
Watch what I tell you.

27:08.828 --> 27:10.694
So, I'm gonna go
stash it

27:10.763 --> 27:12.930
so that I can pull it out
and be like,

27:12.999 --> 27:14.031
"Here you go,
I got you a present."

27:14.100 --> 27:15.366
Run.
All right.

27:15.434 --> 27:17.134
Codi, you're pulling out
all the tricks.

27:17.203 --> 27:18.135
When you go on a date
with Codi,

27:18.204 --> 27:19.136
that's what you get, baby.

27:19.205 --> 27:20.671
(girls chuckling)

27:20.740 --> 27:23.540
It took literally all summer

27:23.609 --> 27:25.142
to make this date happen
for Codi,

27:25.211 --> 27:26.977
and he's taking it
very seriously.

27:27.046 --> 27:29.546
Like, he wants this
to go good.

27:29.615 --> 27:31.415
(Jeremiah)
It's about that time.

27:31.484 --> 27:33.917
Do you need me to write down,
like, any ice-breaker jokes?

27:33.986 --> 27:35.452
(Kirk)
Oh, God.
No.

27:35.521 --> 27:38.122
(Jeremiah)
For your sake...
I think I'll pass.

27:38.190 --> 27:39.156
You look nervous.

27:39.225 --> 27:40.257
You do look a little
nervous, honestly.

27:40.326 --> 27:41.725
I got it,
baby, I got it.

27:41.794 --> 27:43.193
(Kirk)
Cheers, brother.
I got it.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.333
We're ready.

Oh!

Down the stairs
Candace's walk in,

27:54.974 --> 27:57.675
and she looks amazing.

27:57.743 --> 28:00.511
I mean, I'm talking gorgeous.

28:00.579 --> 28:02.046
I gave her one
of my heavy hitters.

28:02.114 --> 28:03.647
Turn around and let him

You look good, girl.

Ooh!
Yikes!

28:08.721 --> 28:11.088
She has this nice dress on,

look like fa-fam!

28:13.793 --> 28:16.427

It only took all summer
to make this happen.

28:16.495 --> 28:18.529
Oh, Lord.

28:18.597 --> 28:19.630
Bye, guys.

28:19.699 --> 28:21.365
(overlapping farewells)

28:21.434 --> 28:22.900
I don't have sex
on the first date, Codi.

28:22.968 --> 28:23.901
I don't either.

28:23.969 --> 28:25.002
(Aimee)
Oh, I'm 'bout to cry.

28:25.071 --> 28:26.603
I ain't never seen
her smile that big.

28:26.672 --> 28:28.706
I know, she's been
like that all day.

Good for her.
Good for them.

Oh my God, we're going to jail.

32:48.367 --> 32:50.000
You might as well
give me another drink?

32:50.069 --> 32:51.768
You want another one, okay.
I'm still picking on this.

32:51.837 --> 32:54.604
So, I know you
grew up in Memphis.
Uh-huh.

32:54.673 --> 32:58.742
And you lived in Missouri
for a while, and then...

32:58.811 --> 33:00.344
I was born in St. Louis.

33:00.412 --> 33:04.114
I moved to Memphis
when I was three.

33:04.183 --> 33:06.016
And you like it?
And...

33:06.085 --> 33:07.784
You know what,
Memphis is my home.

33:07.853 --> 33:09.753
Memphis is my roots,
my ground.

33:09.822 --> 33:12.556
I know half
of everybody in Memphis.
Yeah.

33:12.624 --> 33:14.691
Like, that's my--
that's my city, for real.

33:14.760 --> 33:17.260
You know, I'm learning
so much about Candace.

33:17.329 --> 33:20.864
I'm learning about her family,
you know, where she comes from.

33:20.933 --> 33:22.232
I'm making sure that
she's happy,

33:22.301 --> 33:23.567
I'm making sure
she's having fun.

33:23.635 --> 33:25.302
You are so funny.

33:25.371 --> 33:27.237
I'm starting to get
the good vibes,

33:27.306 --> 33:29.406
like, I'm starting to feel
really good about this.

33:29.475 --> 33:32.275
I'm not sitting here
and looking to this

33:32.344 --> 33:35.112
turn into a full-blown
make out session, you know.

33:35.180 --> 33:36.713
But I--
I'm not Kortni.

33:36.782 --> 33:38.215
Yeah, ex--
but you know what?

33:38.283 --> 33:41.685
But I am open to, you know,
whatever comes,

33:41.754 --> 33:43.086
you know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

33:43.155 --> 33:45.889
One thing I learned,
you just gotta jump sometimes.

33:45.958 --> 33:47.357
That's how I'm living
the rest of my life.

33:47.426 --> 33:50.327
I am doing nothing but jumping
and trying to conquer things...

33:50.396 --> 33:52.629
Yeah, exactly.
...and do things
that I never thought

33:52.698 --> 33:54.197
I could do.
Exactly.

33:54.266 --> 33:55.766
I've been drinking a lot,
this gonna be a big check.

33:55.834 --> 33:57.601
I don't care.
(laughs)

33:57.669 --> 33:59.836
Think they about to close.

33:59.905 --> 34:01.438
Yeah, they kicking us,
telling us that,

34:01.507 --> 34:03.140
"you ain't gotta
go home, but..."

34:03.208 --> 34:05.008
'Cause she definitely
brought us the check
and we didn't ask for it.

34:05.077 --> 34:06.643
"But you gotta get
the hell up outta here."

34:06.712 --> 34:08.045
"You gotta go."
Yeah.

34:08.113 --> 34:09.179
What are we toasting to?

34:09.248 --> 34:13.717
Our first date and maybe
potentially many more.

34:13.786 --> 34:15.519
Okay, first date,
potentially many more.

34:15.587 --> 34:17.020
Many more.

34:17.089 --> 34:19.456
♪ I want this forever,
just you in the grotto ♪

34:19.525 --> 34:22.726
♪ Nothing but your night's on,

34:22.795 --> 34:25.228
(Candace)
Obviously, the date
is going pretty, pretty good.

34:25.297 --> 34:26.797
Only people left
is the staff.

34:26.865 --> 34:28.065
So, I think
we should probably go.

34:28.133 --> 34:29.666
We're going to Tootsies.

34:29.735 --> 34:32.169
What made your daddy
come talk to me

34:32.237 --> 34:34.237
about giving you a chance?

34:34.306 --> 34:36.073
Maybe he saw the way
you looked at me.

34:36.141 --> 34:37.908
(both laugh)

34:37.976 --> 34:38.942
Stop!

(Carey)
Whoo!

34:59.398 --> 35:03.133
Oh, okay!

35:03.202 --> 35:08.638
So, this older lady was, like,
talking about me to Carey and...

35:08.707 --> 35:11.775
I decided to just grab her
and make out with her.

35:11.844 --> 35:14.444
I mean, why not?
And it's sexy, right?

35:17.182 --> 35:19.216
Be my wing woman.

35:19.284 --> 35:20.851
Are you my wing woman?
No.

35:20.919 --> 35:22.452
Am I a good kisser?
That you are.

35:22.521 --> 35:24.754
Tell him I could probably
(bleep) a guy's (bleep)

35:24.823 --> 35:27.290
better than anybody
else here.
I know.
You could.

35:32.431 --> 35:34.564
(Kirk)
Kortni's making out
with that old lady.

35:34.633 --> 35:35.799
What the (bleep)?!

35:35.868 --> 35:37.234
(Nilsa)
Yuck! I couldn't even imagine

35:37.302 --> 35:40.837
kissing a old lady that's
old enough to be my grandma.

35:40.906 --> 35:43.039
(Kirk)
I swear-- Look! Look!

35:43.108 --> 35:44.341
(Gus)
She's making out with who?

35:44.409 --> 35:46.676
(Kirk)
Look!
Mama! Mama!
Tell her to stop.

35:46.745 --> 35:49.045
Kortni's making out
with a 80-year-old lady.
Mama! Tell Kortni to stop.

35:49.114 --> 35:51.448
You know, I always say there's
nothing that Kortni can do

35:51.517 --> 35:53.583
that's actually gonna
surprise me at this point.

35:53.652 --> 35:54.985
But, apparently,
I'm speaking too soon.

35:55.053 --> 35:57.721
She's making out with this,
like, 70-year-old lady.

35:57.789 --> 35:59.222
The lady don't even
have all her teeth.

35:59.291 --> 36:00.790
And she's
going to town on it.

36:00.859 --> 36:01.992
Like, she's gettin' all up
in there.

36:02.060 --> 36:03.593
It's absolutely disgusting.

36:03.662 --> 36:06.496
All right,
we've had enough here.
We've had enough.

36:06.565 --> 36:09.065
There's so many people in here
that I still have to kiss, Gus.

36:09.134 --> 36:11.601
(Kirk)
They just (bleep) made out.

36:11.670 --> 36:12.669
What the (bleep)?!

36:12.738 --> 36:13.904
Kortni's the make out
queen tonight.

36:13.972 --> 36:17.340
She's making out
with this old lady.

36:17.409 --> 36:20.243
And then turns right around
and makes out with Carey.

36:20.312 --> 36:22.078
She's making out
with that guy now.

36:22.147 --> 36:26.583
Literally,
in a 30 second span.

36:26.652 --> 36:28.652
(Kirk)
And that girl!

36:28.720 --> 36:30.353
Bruh, what the (bleep)?

36:30.422 --> 36:32.856
We need to get out of here
before Kortni starts kissing
the entire bar.

36:32.925 --> 36:35.091
(Kirk)
Go!
(Nilsa)
Aimee.

36:36.595 --> 36:37.527
What?

36:40.365 --> 36:42.465
We're PCB local
too, sweetie.
I'm not talking (bleep).

36:42.534 --> 36:44.034
Sure, whatever.
(Nilsa)
I don't even know you.

36:44.102 --> 36:46.269
Time to go.
God bless you.

36:46.338 --> 36:47.604
God bless you.

36:49.775 --> 36:51.208
What?
What'd she say?
Aimee, keep it moving.

36:51.276 --> 36:52.242
Keep it moving, Aimee.
What'd she say?

36:54.179 --> 36:56.079
I am from here.
I am from here.

36:56.148 --> 36:58.415
I'm not making it
look ratchet, bitch.
We're not.

36:58.483 --> 37:00.083
(Nilsa)
As we're leaving to go home,

37:00.152 --> 37:03.119
this lady starts going in on us
saying we make locals look bad,

37:03.188 --> 37:04.654
and we're ratchet.

37:04.723 --> 37:06.957
You have something
to say slick, you can say it
right now.

37:08.460 --> 37:12.128
I'm so angry because we were
doing absolutely nothing wrong.

37:12.197 --> 37:13.296
We're trying to leave
this place,

37:13.365 --> 37:15.265
and this girl
is following us around

37:15.334 --> 37:17.968
calling us ratchet.
No, you're ratchet.

37:18.036 --> 37:20.136
Hey, I'm from Alabama.

37:22.507 --> 37:23.607
Bitch!
Whoa! Whoa!

37:24.977 --> 37:26.843
She is not making
you look ratchet.

37:26.912 --> 37:28.545
You're making
yourself look ratchet.

37:35.687 --> 37:37.587
I am from here.
I am from here.

37:37.656 --> 37:38.588
I'm not making it
look ratchet, bitch.
We're not.

37:38.657 --> 37:39.889
We're really not.

37:39.958 --> 37:42.959
(Aimee)
This girl just keeps
on and on with me.

37:43.028 --> 37:46.630
My roommates are my family.
Don't mess with 'em.

37:48.767 --> 37:49.833
Bitch!
Whoa! Whoa!

37:49.901 --> 37:51.201
Oh, (bleep).

37:51.270 --> 37:54.938
Why would you go around talking
(bleep) to random people?

37:57.109 --> 37:58.942
She is not making
you look ratchet.

37:59.011 --> 38:01.011
You're making
yourself look ratchet.

38:01.079 --> 38:02.479
This girl deserves an Oscar.

38:02.547 --> 38:04.514
She's, like, holding
the side of her face.

38:04.583 --> 38:06.583
She's psycho.

38:06.652 --> 38:08.752
At this point me and Aimee
just need to get in the cabs

38:08.820 --> 38:09.753
and go home.

38:09.821 --> 38:11.354
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go...

38:11.423 --> 38:12.656
Okay, go.

38:14.726 --> 38:17.661
(country music playing)

38:20.499 --> 38:22.232
(Codi)
This date has been amazing.

38:22.301 --> 38:24.634
I'm dancing with Candace.
I'm having so much fun.

38:24.703 --> 38:26.269
We're having a blast.

38:26.338 --> 38:30.040
But little does she know, I got
another trick up the sleeve.

38:35.347 --> 38:36.846
Candace from Memphis.

38:36.915 --> 38:38.114
(woman)
<i> Oh, hell yeah, guys.</i>

38:38.183 --> 38:39.916
<i> I got a very</i>
<i> important announcement.</i>

38:39.985 --> 38:42.052
<i> We got a very important</i>
<i> dedication.</i>

38:42.120 --> 38:45.722
<i> Where's Miss Candace at?</i>
<i> Miss Candace from Memphis?</i>

38:45.791 --> 38:47.957
<i> This next song</i>
<i> is going out to her.</i>

38:48.026 --> 38:50.460
<i> She is on her first date</i>
<i> with this lovely gentleman.</i>
<i> I didn't get his name.</i>

38:52.164 --> 38:53.363
<i> Everybody, put your drinks up.</i>

38:53.432 --> 38:55.799
<i> One, two, three, holla.</i>

38:55.867 --> 38:57.867
(cheering)

39:00.305 --> 39:02.806
<i> Going out to the</i>
<i> lovely new couple.</i>

39:02.874 --> 39:04.708
(Codi laughing)

39:04.776 --> 39:08.211
(Candace)
Dedicating a song to me
at Tootsies was so sweet.

39:08.280 --> 39:11.681
And I was like, aw...
Codi's winning.

39:11.750 --> 39:13.683
He winning out here.

39:13.752 --> 39:15.018
Whoo!

39:15.087 --> 39:16.219
(woman)
<i> Oh, hell yeah.</i>

39:16.288 --> 39:17.754
<i> Going out to Candace.</i>
<i> And I'm sorry,</i>

39:17.823 --> 39:19.055
<i> what was your</i>
<i> name, honey?</i>

39:19.124 --> 39:20.523
Codi.
Codi.

39:20.592 --> 39:23.560
<i> Candace and Codi on their</i>
<i> first date, everybody.</i>

39:23.628 --> 39:25.695
<i> Give 'em a round of applause.</i>
<i> Hell yeah.</i>

39:25.764 --> 39:28.398
<i> This is extra special.</i>

39:28.467 --> 39:32.001
Yeah, this has been one
of the best dates of my life.

39:32.070 --> 39:36.239
And there possibly could
be something here.

39:36.308 --> 39:37.974
So I'm really
excited for the future

39:38.043 --> 39:39.776
and what is gonna
come between us.

39:45.050 --> 39:48.585
Codi has definitely
exceeded my expectations.

39:48.653 --> 39:50.720
He's treated me
like a queen.

39:50.789 --> 39:53.656
This is the best date
I've ever been on.

39:53.725 --> 39:56.025
I did not expect the date
to go this good.

39:56.094 --> 39:57.927
(Candace)
I had such a great time.
Did you?

39:57.996 --> 40:00.063
You didn't spend too
much money in Tootsies?

40:00.132 --> 40:03.233
I feel bad.
I don't give
a (bleep) about that.

40:03.301 --> 40:07.637
♪♪

40:07.706 --> 40:10.173
(Kortni)
Still like to punch a ho.

I threw my drink on her.

40:10.242 --> 40:12.041
Oh, there's police.

40:12.110 --> 40:13.576
Everyone shut
the (bleep) up.

40:13.645 --> 40:14.944
Put your seatbelts on.

40:15.013 --> 40:16.479

seatbelts on.

We are...

40:20.218 --> 40:21.718

Oh my God.

40:21.787 --> 40:23.620
We're going to jail.
I don't have a seatbelt!
No, I'm going to jail.

40:23.688 --> 40:25.121
Shut the (bleep) up.
I don't have one.

40:25.190 --> 40:27.056
Oh my God.
What have I done?

40:27.125 --> 40:28.858
Is kissing a crime now?

40:28.927 --> 40:31.294
Like is it illegal to kiss
14 people in a bar?

40:33.799 --> 40:36.032
The reason I'm stopping you is
because there was an altercation

40:36.101 --> 40:37.700
at Newby's back there.

40:37.769 --> 40:38.902
Who was involved?

40:38.970 --> 40:40.670
I was.
Can I talk to you
for a sec?

40:40.739 --> 40:42.639
(Aimee)
My stomach drops.

40:42.707 --> 40:44.607
This girl has called the cops.

40:44.676 --> 40:46.209
Here we (bleep) go.

40:47.512 --> 40:49.179
Oh my God.

40:51.082 --> 40:51.848
(Jeremiah)
Next time on
"Floribama Shore."

40:51.917 --> 40:53.450
You are under arrest
for battery.

40:53.518 --> 40:55.685
What did I just do?

40:55.754 --> 40:58.154

<i> Your brother's graduating.</i>
<i> Are you coming home?</i>

40:58.223 --> 40:59.522
Uh...

40:59.591 --> 41:00.690
(Codi)
What happened?

41:00.759 --> 41:02.859
So... I gotta leave
the beach house early.

41:02.928 --> 41:04.394
My little brother's graduating.

41:04.463 --> 41:07.163
(woman)
<i> It's been confirmed</i>
<i> that her nose is broken.</i>

41:07.232 --> 41:09.532
I am about to have
a full blown panic attack.
