00:01.000 --> 00:02.900
I'm just a girl who wants to be a lawyer.

00:03.000 --> 00:05.900
Wants to do her job,
be a good wife, a good mother.

00:06.400 --> 00:07.800
Be like everybody else.

00:07.800 --> 00:10.500
But you're not like everybody
else and you know that.

00:11.200 --> 00:13.400
Even among the special, you're special.

00:13.900 --> 00:15.700
Who might this be?
Looks familiar.

00:15.900 --> 00:17.800
He and his friend raped a young girl.

00:17.900 --> 00:19.700
Sliced her open.
Took her apart.

00:19.806 --> 00:22.300
Dr. Charles -The Butcher- Walker of Wichita.

00:22.302 --> 00:24.603
Wanted dead or alive
for the maniacal evisceration

00:24.609 --> 00:26.600
of 3 unmarried daughters
from the Great Plains.

00:26.707 --> 00:28.603
Seems like every 15 years or so,

00:28.609 --> 00:30.900
someone hears a voice
and a young girl dies.

00:33.408 --> 00:34.403
Ladies.

00:34.905 --> 00:37.103
If you'd kindly take a seat
in the waiting room,

00:37.407 --> 00:40.400
the doctor and I will finish up
and be with you shortly.

00:49.207 --> 00:51.601
I know it hurts, Maura
but we're almost there.

00:52.507 --> 00:53.801
I'm sure of it.

00:54.605 --> 00:56.500
Our baby is a stubborn one.

00:56.905 --> 00:58.302
Isn't he, Charles?

00:58.705 --> 01:00.901
Takes after his blessed Mother, I suppose.

01:03.308 --> 01:04.903
A word, Mr. Walker.

01:11.508 --> 01:13.703
She's been in labor
for over 30 hours now.

01:13.807 --> 01:15.801
Something clearly is not right.

01:17.806 --> 01:20.500
Just how old is your wife, Mr. Walker?

01:25.407 --> 01:28.502
I think it's time we considered
an alternate method of delivery.

01:28.507 --> 01:29.901
You intend to cut her?

01:30.005 --> 01:33.203
Mr. Walker, I'm seeing an
unusual amount of blood.

01:33.805 --> 01:36.103
I fear it may already be
too late for Mrs. Walker,

01:36.107 --> 01:38.301
but there's still a chance
I can save the baby.

01:38.308 --> 01:39.402
Doctor,

01:39.408 --> 01:41.903
I don't re about the baby.

01:42.307 --> 01:44.500
Honestly, all I care about is Maura.

01:44.707 --> 01:46.403
It's all right, Charles.

01:46.506 --> 01:49.402
The only thing that matters
is our child.

01:49.607 --> 01:52.002
I don't agree.
I don't agree with any of this.

01:52.106 --> 01:53.602
You're going to be fine.

01:54.608 --> 01:57.501
- We just need a little more time.
- With all due respect,

01:57.707 --> 02:00.801
you're not a doctor, you don't
know the first thing about medicine.

02:01.205 --> 02:03.201
There... There is no time.

02:05.807 --> 02:06.900
Maura!

02:07.105 --> 02:08.701
It's all right,
Charles.

02:09.407 --> 02:10.699
Let him do...

02:10.806 --> 02:12.402
what he has to do.

02:13.006 --> 02:14.101
Maura!

02:17.208 --> 02:18.801
Doctor, open the door!

02:19.607 --> 02:21.202
Maura, I'm here.

02:24.107 --> 02:25.102
Maura?

02:27.907 --> 02:28.901
No!

02:38.806 --> 02:40.001
It's a boy.

02:48.905 --> 02:50.602
Sir, your child needs you.

02:53.308 --> 02:55.002
<i>Sir, have you gone mad?</i>

02:56.306 --> 02:58.601
<i>Your place is out here
with this child, not...</i>

02:58.607 --> 03:00.502
<i>not in there with a dead woman!</i>

03:14.907 --> 03:16.902
<i>Sir, what are you doing in there?</i>

03:18.908 --> 03:21.202
<i>I'm going to the police, Mr. Walker.</i>

03:26.407 --> 03:29.502
<i>If you do not unlock this door and
come out here and be with this baby,</i>

03:29.608 --> 03:31.600
<i>I'll be forced to go to the police!</i>

03:38.105 --> 03:39.203
Mommy?

03:39.807 --> 03:41.201
You okay?

03:44.107 --> 03:45.802
Hi, Sugarbear.

03:47.408 --> 03:48.803
Yeah, I'm okay.

03:49.908 --> 03:51.301
Just had a nightmare.

03:51.508 --> 03:52.602
Just a...

03:53.006 --> 03:55.303
a silly little nightmare.

03:56.107 --> 03:57.703
Was it scary?

03:59.408 --> 04:01.001
It was scary.

04:01.508 --> 04:02.702
And sad.

04:03.606 --> 04:05.900
Don't worry, Mommy.
It was just a dream.

04:06.106 --> 04:08.200
You probably won't even
remember it by morning.

04:10.407 --> 04:11.802
Thanks, Bridge.

04:17.904 --> 04:19.500
Think about ice cream.

04:19.706 --> 04:21.502
Or cake. That's what I do.

04:22.705 --> 04:24.502
Chocolate works really good.

04:24.807 --> 04:26.703
- Got it.
- Candy, too.

04:26.705 --> 04:29.100
Or cereal if it's close to morning.

04:34.207 --> 04:36.301
Cookies are really good, too.

04:40.005 --> 04:41.203
Mommy?

04:41.608 --> 04:42.902
I'm hungry.

04:45.807 --> 04:46.901
Never mind.

05:34.605 --> 05:36.803
Hi. I don't know if you remember me.

05:36.905 --> 05:39.403
Allison Dubois.
Of course I remember you.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.703
So you still dream, huh?

05:42.407 --> 05:43.800
That's a good thing,
I suppose.

05:44.308 --> 05:46.803
Better than being like me.
I just don't sleep.

05:46.906 --> 05:48.303
Afraid  to, I guess.

05:48.607 --> 05:50.100
Afraid of what I'll see.

05:50.706 --> 05:52.101
There must be a reason

05:52.207 --> 05:54.500
I had a dream about
Walker and his wife, right?

05:54.908 --> 05:57.402
I just don't know how
to make sense of what I saw.

05:57.807 --> 05:59.502
In that case, what do you feel?

06:00.605 --> 06:01.703
Feel?

06:02.206 --> 06:05.802
What you see can sometimes fool you,
but what you feel rarely lets you down.

06:06.005 --> 06:07.000
Well,

06:07.007 --> 06:09.101
I felt the same way I always feel

06:09.107 --> 06:10.801
when I see him in my dreams.

06:11.006 --> 06:13.603
That some girl is poised to die soon.

06:14.007 --> 06:15.703
That he's up to his old tricks.

06:15.808 --> 06:18.303
That he's found someone
in the here and now to do his bidding,

06:18.307 --> 06:20.202
and it's just a matter of time.

06:20.206 --> 06:21.800
See that?
You don't even need me.

06:21.808 --> 06:23.402
Then why did I see a moment

06:23.405 --> 06:25.401
from Walker's past,
and not his present?

06:25.608 --> 06:28.602
Why didn't I see the face
of the man he's whispering to?

06:29.005 --> 06:31.101
Or a clue as to who
his next victim's gonna be?

06:31.206 --> 06:33.900
Maybe you don't need
to see those things to stop him.

06:35.608 --> 06:37.301
God doesn't play dice with the universe,

06:37.407 --> 06:40.603
and people like us don't see the
things we do without a reason.

06:41.008 --> 06:42.503
I  know it's not easy but--

06:42.808 --> 06:45.800
You have to have faith that the reason
will make itself known to you,

06:46.208 --> 06:48.303
either in your dreams
or your waking life.

06:53.208 --> 06:55.802
Oh, my poor kids. 
I'm a terrible cook.

06:56.005 --> 06:57.701
It smells delicious.

06:58.007 --> 07:00.201
but I couldn't resist.

07:00.305 --> 07:01.800
but I couldn't resist.

07:01.908 --> 07:04.503
Grocery store up the street
was having a sale.

07:04.608 --> 07:06.702
I've got some extra coupons
if you'r interested.

07:16.808 --> 07:19.901
<i>Nothing like slicing a ripe one
right down the middle.</i>

07:22.005 --> 07:23.900
Sorry, did you say something?

07:24.505 --> 07:26.903
I said the ripe ones
are usually in the middle.

07:38.108 --> 07:40.403
Move your ass, Amanda.

07:40.705 --> 07:42.300
/*Stacey's  got a table for us*/ out front,

07:42.306 --> 07:44.102
and I've got a quiz fifth period.

07:47.007 --> 07:48.902
<i>I damn near got a speeding ticket,</i>

07:48.908 --> 07:51.092
but I made it.
Now I don't see you.

07:51.308 --> 07:53.703
Thanks for hurrying over.
Five cars ahead on your left.

07:53.706 --> 07:55.402
I'm in the Volvo.

08:04.808 --> 08:06.601
- So where's the girl?
- She's over there.

08:06.606 --> 08:08.802
She's got the green
school jacket on.

08:09.506 --> 08:11.602
Thought you said
this girl was in danger.

08:11.706 --> 08:12.701
She is.

08:12.705 --> 08:14.403
She just doesn't know it yet.

08:14.805 --> 08:16.403
Do you remember that doctor?

08:16.407 --> 08:18.101
The one who has a thing
for teenage girls?

08:18.107 --> 08:19.500
The one from the 1800s?

08:20.008 --> 08:21.500
Your friend the "ghost guy"?

08:21.808 --> 08:23.600
Don't do that. You were there.

08:23.908 --> 08:25.901
I was there Allison,
and I remember a butcher.

08:25.907 --> 08:28.101
And I remember the girl
he was determined to cut up.

08:28.106 --> 08:29.803
But do I remember Walker?

08:29.908 --> 08:31.801
I can't say I ever really
laid eyes on the guy,

08:31.908 --> 08:34.299
but I'll take your word for it,
so... point him out to me.

08:34.302 --> 08:36.602
Or point out the person
you think he's working through.

08:36.708 --> 08:37.700
I can't.

08:37.807 --> 08:39.803
I haven't got a good look at him yet.

08:40.109 --> 08:41.600
I had a dream.

08:42.405 --> 08:44.500
And I heard Walker's voice
when I was in the store.

08:44.505 --> 08:46.003
He was talking
about her.

08:46.207 --> 08:48.500
So we don't even really know
who we're looking for here?

08:48.608 --> 08:51.503
We don't even know what sack of skin
this ghost might have crawled into.

08:51.505 --> 08:53.603
Assuming he's the one
who's really behind this.

08:53.805 --> 08:55.803
Assuming there's a "this"
he's really behind.

08:55.907 --> 08:58.902
Forget about that. Forget about
who he might be working through.

08:58.907 --> 09:00.503
It doesn't matter.

09:00.705 --> 09:02.903
As long as we don't let
this girl out of our sight,

09:03.005 --> 09:04.200
thing can happen, right?

09:04.408 --> 09:06.801
Allison, you're talking about
round-the-clock surveillance.

09:06.908 --> 09:08.701
Multiple guys working multiple shifts.

09:08.906 --> 09:12.202
and all for a girl, who by the way,
may not even be in any real danger.

09:15.705 --> 09:16.902
All right.

09:17.708 --> 09:19.603
I know a couple of guys
who owe me a few favors.

09:19.706 --> 09:21.403
I'll see what I can cobble together.

09:22.006 --> 09:23.701
<i>I know you guys said
we could only watch</i>

09:23.708 --> 09:25.503
ten hours of television a week,

09:25.605 --> 09:26.803
but Mr. Gressler said

09:26.806 --> 09:30.001
that part of studying current events
is keeping up with the news every night.

09:30.205 --> 09:32.001
You could always try reading the paper.

09:32.606 --> 09:35.200
But the paper's,
like, 60 pages long.

09:35.305 --> 09:38.102
And the good thing about TV news
is that it's only a half hour.

09:39.908 --> 09:42.100
Well, I suppose, if it's for school.

09:42.307 --> 09:44.600
So I can watch
12 1/2 hours a week?

09:45.106 --> 09:46.700
Suddenly she's good at math.

09:46.806 --> 09:47.600
No.

09:47.607 --> 09:49.902
You can watch ten hours of television,

09:50.007 --> 09:52.001
and two and a half hours
of news a week.

09:57.206 --> 09:59.201
That was a scrumptious dinner, darling.

09:59.406 --> 10:01.301
You really should've tried some.

10:05.006 --> 10:06.800
I just keep waiting
for the phone to ring.

10:06.906 --> 10:08.100
I just...

10:08.307 --> 10:10.400
keep wishing I'd seen something useful

10:10.507 --> 10:13.202
like the face of the man
he's gonna use to get to her.

10:17.107 --> 10:18.900
A doctor in Bisbee.

10:19.107 --> 10:20.902
Will wonders never cease?

10:21.607 --> 10:22.900
Dr. Charles Walker.

10:23.207 --> 10:25.002
Pleased to make your
acquaintance Ma'am.

10:25.007 --> 10:25.900
Oh, my!

10:26.606 --> 10:28.100
Listen to that accent.

10:28.107 --> 10:29.703
You sound fancy.

10:30.208 --> 10:32.802
Surprised you'd settle
in a place like this.

10:33.506 --> 10:36.502
Bisbee's kind of out of the way
to have a doctor.

10:37.205 --> 10:38.703
I rather like "out of the way."

10:38.907 --> 10:40.300
And "out of the way" is...

10:40.508 --> 10:43.303
where people tend to need a doctor most.
Don't you think?

10:45.908 --> 10:47.300
You know, my daughter

10:47.506 --> 10:49.203
had some pain of late.

10:50.208 --> 10:51.403
Your daughter?

10:51.707 --> 10:53.202
She's at that age.

10:53.405 --> 10:56.000
Everything's changing,
everything's... hurting.

10:56.205 --> 10:58.100
We got some pills
through the mail, but...

10:59.208 --> 11:01.003
Would you like me to have a look?

11:02.607 --> 11:04.600
Your mother says that you experience

11:04.707 --> 11:06.403
pain from time to time.

11:08.908 --> 11:10.000
Yes, sir.

11:10.506 --> 11:12.403
You ever heard of the expression,

11:13.108 --> 11:14.701
"growing pains"?

11:15.105 --> 11:16.203
Yes, sir.

11:22.107 --> 11:24.300
Would you like me to make them go away?

11:25.705 --> 11:27.903
- Go away forever?
- Yes, sir.

11:28.706 --> 11:30.402
I think I can make that happen.

11:30.807 --> 11:32.601
I think I can do that right now,

11:33.007 --> 11:35.201
with one very simple procedure.

11:35.606 --> 11:36.901
Would you like that?

11:37.705 --> 11:38.701
Yes, sir.

11:40.406 --> 11:41.901
Will it hurt, doctor?

11:44.006 --> 11:45.500
Only at first.

11:46.007 --> 11:47.703
But then you'll feel nothing.

11:50.205 --> 11:51.903
For the rest of your life,

11:52.608 --> 11:54.000
you'll feel nothing.

12:16.206 --> 12:17.401
Amanda?

12:18.405 --> 12:19.902
Are you talking to me?

12:19.908 --> 12:22.102
My name's Allison Dubois,
I'm with the city of Phoenix.

12:22.106 --> 12:24.101
I work for the District Attorney's Office.

12:24.106 --> 12:27.002
Am I in some kind of trouble?
Is this about the car accident?

12:27.006 --> 12:28.700
I don't know anything
about an accident.

12:28.708 --> 12:30.803
- But there is a man...
- <i>Amanda!</i>

12:34.808 --> 12:36.301
Can  you hear him?

12:36.508 --> 12:38.000
You can see him!

12:38.708 --> 12:41.200
People actually eat
at this hour in the sun?

12:41.805 --> 12:43.402
Stay where you are!

12:43.705 --> 12:46.702
- Who's this? A friend of your mom's?
- I don't know, she just showed up.

12:46.806 --> 12:48.402
Don't you come near her.

12:48.505 --> 12:50.603
And stop talking.
We can see you.

12:51.005 --> 12:53.003
Police! I need your help.

12:53.407 --> 12:55.002
He's gonna hurt this girl!

12:55.007 --> 12:57.503
Miss, I think you have me
confused with someone else.

12:57.607 --> 12:59.500
Put her in protective custody!

12:59.705 --> 13:02.602
I know you can't see the man
who's threatening her, but...

13:02.805 --> 13:04.803
Hands in the air!
And body on the ground now!

13:05.208 --> 13:07.802
- He's my friend.
- What the hell is going on?

13:08.606 --> 13:10.300
What's wrong with you people?

13:10.608 --> 13:12.003
You okay, Ma'am?

13:17.207 --> 13:18.303
Actually...

13:18.706 --> 13:21.100
I can't help but kind of wish
he was a ghost.

13:21.307 --> 13:22.403
Excuse me?

13:23.105 --> 13:25.600
Ghosts, for the most part,
have very limited legal rights.

13:25.607 --> 13:28.500
Extremely rare that you hear about one
suing a city or county government

13:28.508 --> 13:30.003
for false arrest.

13:34.705 --> 13:37.001
You were half right.
The guy's name is Walker.

13:37.805 --> 13:39.703
Only it's Jack, not Charles.

13:40.407 --> 13:42.701
Who knows, maybe he's
the son of the son of the son.

13:43.007 --> 13:44.302
I dreamt...

13:44.405 --> 13:46.903
about the birth of his
great-grandfather the other night.

13:47.205 --> 13:49.001
Anyway, this Walker's 36, unmarried,

13:49.008 --> 13:51.600
owns some kind of computer
repair store on the west side.

13:51.908 --> 13:54.401
A DUI 18 months ago,
other than that, he's clean.

13:54.707 --> 13:56.603
Maybe it's my imagination,
but I do sense

13:56.605 --> 13:59.503
our boy jonesing for a drink.
Not that that's against the law.

14:01.108 --> 14:03.000
And how do these two
know each other?

14:03.207 --> 14:05.703
She t-boned him at an intersection
a couple months ago.

14:05.808 --> 14:07.802
Whole left side of his car got crushed.

14:08.008 --> 14:09.302
Any record of this?

14:09.605 --> 14:11.103
Walker wanted to call an ambulance,

14:11.208 --> 14:14.000
but she didn't want her parents
finding out she'd been in an accident.

14:14.007 --> 14:16.300
He agreed not to call the cops
or the insurance company

14:16.306 --> 14:18.700
if she let him take her
to a doctor he knew.

14:23.107 --> 14:25.200
<i>She's en paying
for the car repairs and the...</i>

14:25.306 --> 14:26.502
...doctor visit ever since.

14:26.606 --> 14:29.902
In fact, according to him, that's what
he was doing at the grocery store today.

14:30.205 --> 14:32.302
Picking up the latest installment.

14:33.008 --> 14:35.202
Everything I saw when I looked at her.

14:35.606 --> 14:38.202
It wasn't a premonition, it already happed.

14:39.907 --> 14:42.000
I thought I saw Charles Walker
trying to hurt her.

14:42.006 --> 14:44.503
It was really that man
trying to help her.

14:45.906 --> 14:46.802
Hello.

14:46.908 --> 14:48.401
In here.

14:56.205 --> 14:58.401
Okay, what have you
done with my children?

14:58.708 --> 15:00.303
Take a look at the clock, honey.

15:00.508 --> 15:02.203
Marie is already asleep

15:02.606 --> 15:04.800
and Ariel's helping Bridgette
with her homework.

15:04.907 --> 15:07.001
I left some dinner 
for you in the fridge.

15:08.506 --> 15:09.501
Oh, good.

15:09.705 --> 15:12.701
I was afraid I was going to have
to keep after you to eat something

15:12.706 --> 15:14.503
from the alcohol food group.

15:15.306 --> 15:16.503
Back off.

15:16.805 --> 15:18.603
I had an innocent man arrested today

15:18.607 --> 15:20.800
because I thought he was a ghost.

15:24.208 --> 15:26.603
Maybe you should grab me
one of those, too.

15:32.005 --> 15:34.100
You know what the weirdest part was?

15:35.406 --> 15:36.800
How  nice he was.

15:36.906 --> 15:39.900
How reasonable he was
about the whole thing.

15:40.205 --> 15:43.600
He kept reassuring Devalos,
said he wasn't going to sue the city.

15:45.005 --> 15:46.702
He kept telling me to keep my chin up,

15:46.908 --> 15:48.602
that everybody makes mistakes.

15:48.706 --> 15:51.601
He even told Scanlon he hoped
there were
no hard feelings.

15:52.108 --> 15:53.702
Okay. That's nice.

15:55.206 --> 15:58.502
But if this Amanda girl
was never in any real danger,

15:58.907 --> 16:01.100
why do you keep having dreams...

16:01.407 --> 16:03.202
about his great-great uncle.

16:03.406 --> 16:05.201
Or his not so great-great...

16:05.405 --> 16:06.302
...grandfather?

16:06.807 --> 16:09.600
Or whoever this guy Charles is to him?

16:11.007 --> 16:13.100
Don't know. And...

16:15.506 --> 16:16.900
I don't care.

16:17.305 --> 16:18.703
The girl's safe.

16:18.808 --> 16:20.800
Nobody's suing the city.

16:21.107 --> 16:22.700
Mama's finally home.

16:23.905 --> 16:26.200
I say <i>all's</i> right with the world.

16:27.306 --> 16:28.902
All is right with the world.

16:35.807 --> 16:37.403
Beloved Maura...

16:38.407 --> 16:40.701
we bring you gifts from life into death.

16:41.706 --> 16:43.502
We ask that you commune with us,

16:43.806 --> 16:45.400
and move among us.

16:46.408 --> 16:47.900
Join us, Maura,

16:48.808 --> 16:52.100
so that your husband
may know your presence once more.

16:55.608 --> 16:56.702
What?

16:59.608 --> 17:01.301
She's been watching you.

17:01.608 --> 17:03.202
She's seen it all.

17:03.905 --> 17:06.203
Seen the terrible things you've done.

17:09.108 --> 17:10.801
She wants to know why.

17:12.005 --> 17:14.099
Why would you hurt those girls?

17:15.905 --> 17:17.501
She doesn't understand.

17:22.506 --> 17:24.403
It still hurts to be without her.

17:25.306 --> 17:27.702
It's the only thing
that makes the pain go away.

17:28.407 --> 17:29.500
Tell her.

17:32.607 --> 17:34.402
- She's gone.
- Get her back.

17:34.708 --> 17:35.801
I can't.

17:36.107 --> 17:38.202
I said get her back! Now!

17:38.905 --> 17:40.100
Charles,

17:40.107 --> 17:41.902
Charles you're hurting me.

17:46.405 --> 17:47.701
I'm sorry, Mother.

17:53.207 --> 17:55.103
So his mother has the gift.

17:56.108 --> 17:58.300
Prably watched her
talk to ghosts his whole life.

17:59.007 --> 18:00.802
I wonder if that's when
he first figured out

18:00.806 --> 18:03.200
that the dead can
communicate with the living.

18:04.005 --> 18:05.601
So let me ask you a question.

18:05.806 --> 18:08.500
Charles's mother had a gift.
She was sensitive.

18:08.806 --> 18:11.100
What are the chances
another relative could be?

18:11.705 --> 18:14.100
You know better than I do
that it runs in families.

18:14.805 --> 18:16.600
It can span generations.

18:16.906 --> 18:18.502
So if Jack were sensitive,

18:18.608 --> 18:21.403
Charles could, theoretically,
be whispering in his ear,

18:21.606 --> 18:23.600
pointing him in the direction
of his next victim.

18:24.608 --> 18:25.902
So how do I find out

18:25.908 --> 18:28.701
if the young Walker
has the old Walker in his head?

18:31.407 --> 18:33.002
Why don't you ask him?

18:55.107 --> 18:57.202
I'm not about to get tackled, am I?

18:57.607 --> 18:59.803
I wanted to apologize again.

19:00.108 --> 19:02.102
I couldn't sleep last night, I felt so...

19:02.308 --> 19:04.801
Unnecessary yesterday,
unnecessary today.

19:07.108 --> 19:08.202
And also...

19:08.406 --> 19:10.900
since I was in the area,
I was wondering if I could...

19:11.105 --> 19:12.700
talk to you about something.

19:13.107 --> 19:15.402
I-I'm on a little bit of a schedule,

19:15.605 --> 19:16.900
actually. Uh...

19:19.205 --> 19:21.001
Well, the main thing...

19:22.608 --> 19:23.800
is...

19:26.605 --> 19:28.000
Are we alone?

19:30.907 --> 19:31.901
Yeah.

19:32.107 --> 19:33.500
No, I mean...

19:35.105 --> 19:36.403
Am I...

19:36.608 --> 19:39.903
the only person you are
listening to right now?

19:44.106 --> 19:45.502
Sorry, I'm...

19:45.905 --> 19:47.301
taking medication.

19:47.307 --> 19:48.601
on schedule. 

19:49.807 --> 19:51.401
I'll be right back.

19:52.106 --> 19:54.103
No problem. Go right ahead.

20:18.407 --> 20:19.503
She's a bit...

20:21.407 --> 20:23.901
...obsessed with me, actually.

20:25.205 --> 20:27.603
Honestly, I-I'm not at all interested.

20:27.908 --> 20:28.901
I...

20:29.108 --> 20:31.403
just want the money
she owes me for the car

20:31.508 --> 20:32.900
and  the doctor.

20:33.205 --> 20:34.301
I believe you.

20:34.408 --> 20:36.200
I know you're not interested.

20:37.908 --> 20:40.803
Which is why I was asking.
Are we alone?

20:41.206 --> 20:42.803
I'm sorry, I'm...

20:43.206 --> 20:44.500
You hear him,don't you?

20:44.708 --> 20:46.900
In your head.
Telling you to hurt her.

20:47.508 --> 20:49.403
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

20:49.506 --> 20:52.703
Sure you do!
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

20:52.905 --> 20:55.601
You are fighting it
with everynch of your being.

20:55.906 --> 20:59.401
You are fighting it with the alcohol
you just drank in the bathroom.

21:00.108 --> 21:02.802
What do you do?
Do you time each dose?

21:03.507 --> 21:05.702
Just enough to keep
the voice of the devil away,

21:05.807 --> 21:08.801
but not enough to make it
impossible to live?

21:09.008 --> 21:10.202
To work?

21:14.805 --> 21:15.901
Okay.

21:19.407 --> 21:20.901
This is for you, not him.

21:21.205 --> 21:22.600
not him.

21:23.007 --> 21:24.901
He already knows me.

21:32.906 --> 21:34.301
<i>Burn! Burn him out!</i>

21:34.407 --> 21:36.602
You would not believe
the size of the crowd

21:36.705 --> 21:38.500
we got outside tonight.

21:40.105 --> 21:41.703
They're all here for you.

21:44.805 --> 21:47.000
I don't think I've ever felt so loved.

21:47.508 --> 21:50.501
I'm glad to see you still got
your sense of humor, Doc.

21:50.805 --> 21:52.700
I was afraid we'd beaten it out of you

21:52.705 --> 21:54.800
when we tracked you down the other night.

21:55.108 --> 21:57.300
It's a show these simpletons are waiting for.

21:57.807 --> 22:00.503
You can remind them, I don't
hang for another three days.

22:01.808 --> 22:04.002
I don't think they intend to wait that long.

22:04.806 --> 22:06.203
Truth be told,

22:06.607 --> 22:09.303
when I think about what
you did to all those girls,

22:09.907 --> 22:11.703
I'm tempted to let 'em in here.

22:12.507 --> 22:14.803
Save us the cost
of building a gallows.

22:18.207 --> 22:20.201
- That you, Deputy?
- Yes, sir.

22:20.506 --> 22:22.101
Prisoner's got a visitor.

22:22.105 --> 22:23.601
Says she's his mother.

22:34.307 --> 22:35.603
Oh, my poor boy.

22:35.606 --> 22:36.700
<i>Get him out!</i>

22:36.707 --> 22:38.303
What have they done to you?

22:38.505 --> 22:40.603
Probably no more than I deserve, Mother.

22:44.006 --> 22:45.200
Sorry, Sheriff.

22:45.307 --> 22:46.902
They come up behind me.

22:47.207 --> 22:49.100
It's all right, Mother.
I'm not afraid.

22:49.408 --> 22:51.301
I'm finally going to be with Maura.

22:51.308 --> 22:53.300
No, you're not.

22:53.405 --> 22:55.300
You don't understand, do you?

22:55.505 --> 22:58.303
You're never going to be with her,
not after the things you've done.

22:58.305 --> 23:01.901
- You're wrong, she'll forgive me.
- It doesn't matter, Charles.

23:02.006 --> 23:04.003
You're not going to where she is.

23:05.408 --> 23:06.600
Then I'm not going.

23:07.008 --> 23:08.403
Say your prayers, Walker.

23:09.405 --> 23:11.501
Do you hear me, Mother?
Do you understand?

23:11.708 --> 23:14.500
I-WILL-NOT-DIE!

23:20.105 --> 23:22.501
Allison we've already
mistakenly arrested this man once.

23:22.507 --> 23:23.900
I don't think you understand

23:23.907 --> 23:26.003
how determined the forces
that are driving him are.

23:26.005 --> 23:28.700
These forces you keep talking about
are not something I control

23:28.707 --> 23:31.201
frankly, they're not even something
I necessarily believe in.

23:31.205 --> 23:33.501
I know you think
I have a very powerful job,

23:33.507 --> 23:37.602
but influencing the behavior of the
dead falls decidedly outside my purview.

23:49.006 --> 23:51.601
The first time I heard the voice, I was 15.

23:52.308 --> 23:54.601
I was at the movies with Torie Keeler.

23:54.807 --> 23:56.901
It started rhapsodizing about...

23:57.305 --> 23:59.601
the shape and the size of her bosom.

24:00.408 --> 24:03.101
I wasn't terribly concerned
at first, because...

24:03.707 --> 24:04.801
frankly,

24:05.205 --> 24:08.401
I'd given a fair amount of thought to
the shape and size of her bosom myself.

24:10.406 --> 24:11.803
A week later...

24:12.308 --> 24:14.000
it started whispering to me about

24:14.208 --> 24:16.000
how divine it would be...

24:17.008 --> 24:19.403
to see a drop of her menstrual blood,

24:20.608 --> 24:22.001
work its way

24:22.205 --> 24:24.203
down her pale, white thigh.

24:27.508 --> 24:29.700
Since I'd never seen
menstrual blood

24:29.808 --> 24:33.303
and only had the vaguest understanding
of what it was or when it might appear,

24:33.905 --> 24:36.503
I came to the rapid conclusion
that I was mentally ill.

24:38.805 --> 24:40.101
The second I was alone,

24:40.305 --> 24:42.103
I smoked a copious amount of marijuana

24:42.108 --> 24:44.200
and discovered the damndest thing.

24:46.408 --> 24:48.203
I got very hungry, and...

24:48.407 --> 24:50.503
I couldn't hear the voice anymore.

24:52.507 --> 24:54.300
With age comes wisdom.

24:54.708 --> 24:56.703
And I soon discovered that alcohol

24:57.008 --> 24:58.501
worked better than grass.

24:58.705 --> 25:01.502
And by medicating myself with
tiny amounts throughout the day,

25:02.207 --> 25:05.403
I could pretty much eliminate
the dissertations in my head about...

25:06.206 --> 25:08.001
nipple transplants and...

25:08.407 --> 25:09.902
how beautifully

25:10.105 --> 25:12.002
the skin of a woman in her mid-teens

25:12.007 --> 25:13.903
cuts with a surgical-grade scalpel.

25:19.205 --> 25:21.102
I've never told any of this to anyone.

25:22.908 --> 25:24.201
It must be horrible.

25:24.706 --> 25:26.401
It is what it is.

25:28.007 --> 25:29.700
I'm not sure that I believe

25:30.008 --> 25:31.502
that I have some...

25:32.507 --> 25:35.302
distant relative
residing in my cerebellum.

25:38.207 --> 25:39.902
I am inclined to think that...

25:41.306 --> 25:42.901
whatever mental demons

25:43.005 --> 25:45.802
tormented my famous ancestor...

25:47.805 --> 25:49.903
perhaps a minute amount of that affliction

25:49.907 --> 25:51.601
may have been passed on to me.

25:52.806 --> 25:54.802
I'm just trying to reassure you in my own...

25:55.406 --> 25:56.700
crazy way that...

25:57.605 --> 26:00.003
I think I got this problem under control.

26:01.308 --> 26:02.300
<i>There's something</i>

26:02.305 --> 26:03.403
<i>There's something</i>
so sad about it.

26:03.408 --> 26:06.002
He's absolutely convinced he has to spend

26:06.308 --> 26:08.401
his entire life slightly inebriated

26:08.405 --> 26:09.802
just to function.

26:10.407 --> 26:13.101
I actually I knew any number
of friends in high school

26:13.305 --> 26:15.002
who felt the exact same way.

26:15.206 --> 26:16.200
Not funny.

26:16.207 --> 26:18.500
And they were really into
high school girls, too.

26:18.706 --> 26:20.300
Undressing them, not killing them.

26:24.106 --> 26:26.901
Anything I can do to put
a smile on your face?

26:31.108 --> 26:33.001
That smile didn't last long.

26:33.705 --> 26:35.300
Do you hear that?

26:37.305 --> 26:39.402
<i>...the body was found just over an hour ago</i>

26:39.408 --> 26:42.101
<i>by the night custodian,
here at Park-View high school.</i>

26:42.505 --> 26:44.603
<i>The police has confirmed that the victim</i>

26:44.807 --> 26:47.100
<i>is in fact a student here at Park-View.</i>

26:47.506 --> 26:50.800
<I>But authorities are still withholding
the name of the teenaged victim,

26:51.006 --> 26:53.102
- <i>as the known location of next--</i>
- Ariel?

26:55.207 --> 26:57.201
I know, I know I'm supposed to be in bed

26:57.308 --> 26:58.903
I'm sorry. It's just--

27:00.108 --> 27:02.600
I missed the 7:00 news
'cause I was on the phone,

27:02.706 --> 27:04.402
and I remembered about the late one.

27:04.608 --> 27:07.500
Honey, why are you upset?
Why are you crying?

27:10.406 --> 27:11.802
It's awful.

27:14.607 --> 27:17.502
Some poor girl got killed
in the park tonight.

27:19.406 --> 27:22.002
She was just four years older than me.

27:23.005 --> 27:23.800
Okay.

27:25.105 --> 27:26.500
<i>...just moments ago.</i>

27:26.706 --> 27:29.201
 and our Action News cameras were there.

27:29.508 --> 27:31.500
<i>A man identified as Jack Walker</i>

27:31.706 --> 27:33.202
 was found wandering not far from...

27:33.706 --> 27:35.901
I left my meeting with Ms. Dubois,

27:36.906 --> 27:38.600
headed back to the store.

27:39.707 --> 27:41.501
Cell phone started ringing--
it was Amanda.

27:41.707 --> 27:43.202
She was distraught.

27:43.808 --> 27:46.303
Her parents had found out
about the car accident,

27:46.707 --> 27:48.302
taken her keys...

27:49.506 --> 27:51.203
forbidden her from driving.

27:53.907 --> 27:56.002
She asked me to pick her up; I did.

27:56.507 --> 27:58.203
We drove around forever.

27:58.708 --> 28:00.502
Time was going by.

28:02.305 --> 28:04.503
I realized it had be out for so long.

28:07.505 --> 28:08.701
I needed a drink.

28:10.405 --> 28:11.802
She was too young

28:11.805 --> 28:13.402
to take to a bar, so...

28:14.906 --> 28:17.202
I stopped at a liquor store.

28:19.905 --> 28:21.700
I Got a bottle of whiskey.
Amanda got...

28:22.308 --> 28:23.500
...all excited.

28:23.608 --> 28:26.400
"Let's play a drinking game,
let's play a drinking game."

28:27.007 --> 28:29.900
I didn't want to play a drinking game.
I just wanted a drink.

28:30.808 --> 28:32.702
Well, we ended up parking,

28:32.908 --> 28:34.400
at the high school.

28:36.508 --> 28:37.600
Pathetic, yeah.

28:39.108 --> 28:40.900
She insisted we play this game,

28:41.208 --> 28:42.603
"I never..."

28:44.607 --> 28:46.601
She'd announce something,
something she...

28:47.008 --> 28:49.002
she'd never done,
something she'd never tried.

28:49.207 --> 28:51.403
Something she'd never experienced.

28:51.906 --> 28:53.100
And if...

28:53.405 --> 28:55.300
If I hadn't experienced it either,

28:56.005 --> 28:58.200
then I wouldn't have to take a drink.

28:59.106 --> 29:00.303
I mean...

29:01.507 --> 29:04.301
I walked this earth
twice as long as her.

29:05.805 --> 29:07.903
There's not a lot I haven't experienced.

29:08.406 --> 29:10.001
Suffice to say...

29:10.806 --> 29:12.001
I drank

29:12.007 --> 29:13.902
a prodigious amount of alcohol,

29:14.007 --> 29:15.800
in a fairly short space of time.

29:18.405 --> 29:20.201
Next thing I can remember is

29:20.407 --> 29:22.403
waking up in the car, alone.

29:31.105 --> 29:32.701
I didn't see the blood...

29:34.008 --> 29:35.302
at first.

29:35.708 --> 29:36.900
In the car,

29:37.006 --> 29:38.302
on me.

29:39.605 --> 29:41.203
I didn't see the knife.

29:41.806 --> 29:44.000
Are you suggesting
that you had a blackout?

29:44.806 --> 29:47.000
I'm just telling you
everything I remember.

29:47.508 --> 29:49.402
My client has a history of blackouts.

29:49.906 --> 29:51.603
He's made no secret of that.

29:51.706 --> 29:52.900
For the record,

29:53.207 --> 29:55.002
are you stating that you had

29:55.006 --> 29:56.802
a blackout earlier this evening?

29:57.008 --> 29:59.200
It's certainly happened
in the past, but...

29:59.508 --> 30:00.700
honestly,

30:01.405 --> 30:03.102
I never hurt anyone before.

30:03.306 --> 30:05.902
Mr. Walker, on the off-chance
that you remember a little bit more

30:05.906 --> 30:07.303
than you're... letting on,

30:07.408 --> 30:09.803
I'd like you to know that this
office is inclined to believe

30:09.806 --> 30:12.702
that you suffer from an acute
psychological condition,

30:13.706 --> 30:16.102
and one that, perhaps,

30:16.908 --> 30:19.302
compelled you to do harm to Amanda Peyer.

30:20.305 --> 30:22.403
If you were to make a full confession,

30:23.008 --> 30:25.002
we would take that
into full consideration.

30:29.108 --> 30:31.200
You're quite sure
I did this, aren't you?

30:36.506 --> 30:38.501
- Is there proof?
- Jack, if they did...

30:38.705 --> 30:40.501
you'd be in a cell by now.

30:42.706 --> 30:44.902
The crime scene... is still fresh,

30:44.908 --> 30:47.002
as are the warrants to search your home,

30:47.205 --> 30:49.101
your business, and your car.

30:49.707 --> 30:51.501
The truth is, we're still gathering

30:51.705 --> 30:53.903
enough physical evidence
to formally charge you,

30:54.008 --> 30:57.002
but I'm confident we can do that
in the 72 hours we have.

30:57.507 --> 30:58.801
72 hours?

30:59.808 --> 31:01.500
That's the amount of time
they can hold you in a cell

31:01.507 --> 31:03.200
without charging you.

31:03.906 --> 31:06.003
I can't go without a drink for three days.

31:06.206 --> 31:07.602
Sure you can.

31:07.905 --> 31:10.401
An officer will be in shortly to process you.

31:18.008 --> 31:20.600
<i>A man identified as Jack Walker
was found walking about...</i>

31:21.508 --> 31:23.000
What are you doing up?

31:23.307 --> 31:25.303
Watching you work, on the news.

31:25.608 --> 31:27.903
<i>...and what appears to be the victim's blood,</i>

31:28.007 --> 31:30.803
<i>still visible, on his clothing and face.</i>

31:34.805 --> 31:36.901
He had me completely fooled.

31:38.506 --> 31:39.700
It's okay.

31:40.206 --> 31:41.700
It's not your fault.

31:42.805 --> 31:44.902
You had two days with the guy.

31:45.406 --> 31:47.202
And Walker had a lifetime.

31:54.407 --> 31:56.601
<i>I'm afraid I have, yeah.</i>

31:57.408 --> 31:58.802
I have...

32:00.106 --> 32:02.501
gone into a lover's medicine cabinet

32:02.808 --> 32:05.002
while she lay sleeping

32:06.005 --> 32:07.500
in the other room, yes.

32:08.005 --> 32:09.000
Yes.

32:09.908 --> 32:11.102
It's uncanny.

32:12.207 --> 32:14.701
It's uncanny, how, you know.

32:16.107 --> 32:17.802
Now ask him the other one.

32:19.105 --> 32:20.400
Ask him.

32:22.906 --> 32:24.203
Come on!

32:25.005 --> 32:26.302
You won again.

32:26.306 --> 32:27.501
Come on.

32:28.108 --> 32:29.102
Okay.

32:29.908 --> 32:31.502
I never...

32:32.505 --> 32:33.702
wondered

32:33.705 --> 32:36.202
what it would be like
to slice a girl open.

32:38.508 --> 32:41.600
Touch her blood with my fingertips.

32:44.108 --> 32:45.500
Taste it...

32:46.306 --> 32:48.101
with my tongue.

32:55.806 --> 32:57.600
I do believe...

32:58.705 --> 33:00.403
you're the winner again.

33:15.308 --> 33:16.700
Well done.

33:17.008 --> 33:19.702
And now the moment has come
for me, to thank you

33:19.908 --> 33:21.400
for everything.

33:23.008 --> 33:25.403
You've really been sensational.

33:25.806 --> 33:28.203
Colliding with the car
of a perfect stranger.

33:28.407 --> 33:30.003
Pretending to fall
in love with him.

33:30.008 --> 33:31.700
Calling him incessantly.

33:32.505 --> 33:35.300
You're easily the
most suggestible person

33:35.507 --> 33:37.203
that I've ever encountered.

33:38.507 --> 33:41.702
If only you had the intelligence
necessary to become a physician,

33:41.905 --> 33:44.803
I would happily spend
the next ten, or 15 years,

33:44.907 --> 33:46.703
living inside your brain,

33:47.108 --> 33:48.503
telling you what to do.

33:49.707 --> 33:51.203
But halas...

33:52.006 --> 33:53.601
you have no interest

33:53.608 --> 33:55.103
in the medical arts,

33:55.308 --> 33:57.300
and I have no interest

33:57.307 --> 33:59.801
in influencing the thinking

34:00.207 --> 34:02.102
of a walking Kewpie doll.

34:03.507 --> 34:05.603
So I'm afraid this is...

34:06.707 --> 34:07.902
...good-bye.

34:08.905 --> 34:10.502
Did you bring the knife?

34:11.505 --> 34:12.400
Yeah.

34:16.408 --> 34:17.703
All right, then.

34:18.607 --> 34:20.402
Why don't we begin...

34:20.808 --> 34:23.501
by you stabbing yourself in the stomach?

34:25.505 --> 34:27.402
You don't mind if I watch, do you?

34:28.608 --> 34:29.500
I...

34:29.705 --> 34:32.000
really quite enjoy this kind of thing.

34:45.205 --> 34:46.900
He didn't do it-- she did.

34:47.608 --> 34:50.400
Mr. walker, I apologize you've been
detained the past three days,

34:50.406 --> 34:52.101
but I do have some good news.

34:52.306 --> 34:55.202
Our crime scene unit,
at the insistence of Mrs. Dubois here,

34:55.205 --> 34:57.400
has re-examined all
the evidence in this case

34:57.408 --> 34:59.201
and is saying unequivocally,

34:59.406 --> 35:01.401
that Amanda's wounds
were self-inflicted.

35:07.408 --> 35:08.702
Again...

35:09.408 --> 35:10.800
I apologize.

35:11.906 --> 35:12.902
My God.

35:12.905 --> 35:14.600
No apology is necessary.

35:15.706 --> 35:17.803
Under the circumstances, I just--

35:17.906 --> 35:19.603
Go home.
Get some rest.

35:19.605 --> 35:22.000
My office will be speaking
with your attorney.

35:22.207 --> 35:24.001
There may still be some civil issues

35:24.006 --> 35:25.802
that Amanda's parents want to litigate.

35:25.807 --> 35:28.101
having to do with
offering alcohol to a minor,

35:28.107 --> 35:29.403
but I do believe

35:29.405 --> 35:31.601
for the most part,
you're out of the woods.

35:32.808 --> 35:35.300
I have no idea what you did,
but thank you.

35:36.305 --> 35:37.700
How are you feeling?

35:38.405 --> 35:40.200
Other than being in shock, uh...

35:40.505 --> 35:41.501
good.

35:41.807 --> 35:44.300
The first two days
without alcohol were difficult.

35:45.108 --> 35:46.303
Today...

35:48.106 --> 35:49.401
Who knows?

35:49.605 --> 35:52.300
I might actually make a habit
of this... not-drinking thing.

35:54.905 --> 35:56.502
Can I talk to you?

35:57.908 --> 35:59.401
What is it? I'm busy.

35:59.705 --> 36:01.000
What are you doing?

36:01.308 --> 36:02.900
I'm reading the news.

36:04.407 --> 36:06.102
But I don't understand.

36:06.305 --> 36:07.901
Why would you <i>read</i> the news

36:07.906 --> 36:09.801
while you could watch it on TV?

36:13.305 --> 36:14.701
Got it!
Hello?

36:15.108 --> 36:16.400
Mrs. Dubois?

36:16.906 --> 36:18.403
Jack, is that you?

36:18.705 --> 36:20.102
Are you drinking?

36:20.505 --> 36:22.800
No. God knows I want to.

36:23.706 --> 36:25.903
- Where are you?
- I'm at the shop.

36:25.908 --> 36:28.201
I keep thinking I should go out.

36:28.407 --> 36:30.702
I kinda want to be around
some young people.

36:30.705 --> 36:32.001
- Girls.
- Listen to me.

36:32.007 --> 36:34.000
Stay right where you are.
Don't go anywhere.

36:34.005 --> 36:35.500
I'll be there quick as I can.

36:49.307 --> 36:50.403
Jack!

36:52.608 --> 36:54.200
Jack, are you here?

36:55.107 --> 36:56.000
Jack!

36:56.306 --> 36:57.701
Are you here?

37:05.007 --> 37:07.502
Lovely to see you.
I do so appreciate the way

37:07.605 --> 37:09.500
you ran right over here
when I called.

37:10.007 --> 37:11.600
The good doctor, I presume.

37:11.907 --> 37:13.602
Well, maybe not so good.

37:13.805 --> 37:15.802
Maybe not really a doctor either.

37:17.107 --> 37:19.000
So how long
has it been you and not him?

37:19.405 --> 37:20.803
In the jail?

37:21.005 --> 37:23.002
In the interrogation room
with the lawyer?

37:23.706 --> 37:25.301
What about the night Amanda died?

37:25.808 --> 37:27.200
Oh please, I'm good.

37:27.507 --> 37:28.901
But not that good.

37:29.508 --> 37:31.400
I've really only just begun

37:31.405 --> 37:34.201
my residency inside young Jack's skin.

37:36.008 --> 37:37.700
What a superb fit.

37:38.706 --> 37:42.101
Like a suit that's been
custom-made for me by God.

37:45.207 --> 37:47.001
I'll always be grateful for your help.

37:47.008 --> 37:48.301
My help?

37:48.308 --> 37:50.401
Oh my, yes.
I couldn't have done it without you.

37:50.708 --> 37:53.800
I've been whispering
in that boy's ear for 20 years,

37:54.006 --> 37:55.602
trying to pierce that...

37:55.808 --> 37:58.800
self-imposed haze of alcohol.

37:59.505 --> 38:01.801
I tried tempting him with that girl,

38:01.808 --> 38:04.201
but apparently he's managed
to rot his libido

38:04.306 --> 38:05.901
as well as his liver.

38:06.408 --> 38:08.103
And then, suddenly,

38:08.907 --> 38:10.602
there you were...

38:11.108 --> 38:12.101
screaming

38:12.206 --> 38:14.403
for the police in that
supermarket parking lot,

38:14.506 --> 38:16.002
and I thought,
"Wait a second.

38:16.107 --> 38:17.703
"Your good friend Allison,

38:17.806 --> 38:19.603
"she's just presented you with...

38:19.706 --> 38:21.402
a much better idea!"

38:21.508 --> 38:22.503
Me?

38:22.607 --> 38:24.502
Well, thanks to that scene that you made,

38:24.506 --> 38:26.801
my drunken, impotent relative

38:27.007 --> 38:29.903
now had the attention
of the local authorities.

38:31.806 --> 38:35.002
If something unfortunate
were to happen to young Amanda,

38:35.205 --> 38:36.101
well,

38:36.105 --> 38:38.402
he'd be the first person they'd lock up.

38:39.006 --> 38:41.701
A man can get
awfully thirsty in a jail cell.

38:41.806 --> 38:43.502
Awfully thirsty.

38:44.008 --> 38:45.900
And awfully clear-headed.

38:46.606 --> 38:50.101
I knew for the first time
in nearly 20 years,

38:50.806 --> 38:52.501
he'd finally hear me.

38:52.808 --> 38:54.203
And here we are.

38:54.508 --> 38:57.502
You did all of that
so you could finally be in the skin

38:57.605 --> 38:59.701
of someone who looked
exactly like you did?

38:59.906 --> 39:01.700
when you ravaged teenage girls?

39:02.807 --> 39:03.803
Allison.

39:04.208 --> 39:06.100
I did all that so I could
be inside the skin

39:06.206 --> 39:08.100
of someone who looked like me...

39:10.108 --> 39:11.702
when I ravaged you.

39:16.306 --> 39:17.801
I know what you're thinking.

39:17.908 --> 39:19.303
Where's the scalpel?

39:19.307 --> 39:21.002
Where's the surgical saw?

39:21.107 --> 39:22.303
Help!

39:22.408 --> 39:25.601
One of my great disappointments
as I spend time with my progeny,

39:26.806 --> 39:28.503
is their compete and utter

39:28.508 --> 39:30.500
lack of interest in the medical arts.

39:31.307 --> 39:32.401
Oh, well!

39:32.406 --> 39:34.700
What's a great-great grandfather to do?

39:35.105 --> 39:36.401
Adapt, I say.

39:39.108 --> 39:40.202
And so,

39:40.308 --> 39:42.102
in a one-time-only performance,

39:42.108 --> 39:44.302
tonight's slaying will be performed

39:44.306 --> 39:45.600
bare-handed!

39:45.608 --> 39:48.903
I know you're flattered, Allison.
Try not to get too choked up.

40:03.408 --> 40:05.400
If all you wanted to do was kill me,

40:05.406 --> 40:07.403
why did you send me
all of those dreams?

40:10.605 --> 40:12.001
You didn't.

40:12.406 --> 40:14.201
Did you?
She did.

40:14.807 --> 40:16.100
To stop you.

40:16.208 --> 40:17.900
You know nothing of Maura.

40:18.005 --> 40:19.101
I do!

40:19.705 --> 40:21.200
She's here!

40:21.507 --> 40:23.601
She never stopped watching you.

40:23.805 --> 40:25.600
She sees you even now.

40:26.006 --> 40:27.702
What you're doing to me.

40:28.205 --> 40:30.900
What you're doing to her
great-great grandson.

40:31.608 --> 40:33.103
If you kill me,

40:33.307 --> 40:36.302
Jack is going to spend
the rest of his life in prison.

40:36.806 --> 40:38.402
and do you honestly think

40:38.508 --> 40:41.902
she loves him any less
than the child she died for?

41:22.907 --> 41:24.401
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

41:29.006 --> 41:30.703
What am I doing here?

41:35.006 --> 41:36.702
<i>What are ghosts really?</i>

41:36.907 --> 41:38.203
They're energy.

41:38.407 --> 41:40.102
The energy we leave behind.

41:40.406 --> 41:41.801
And energy is power.

41:42.608 --> 41:45.003
<i>Who knows what might happen
when a spirit as powerful</i>

41:45.005 --> 41:47.901
as Charles Walker's finally
decides to cross over?

41:48.308 --> 41:51.403
Or what would happen if the other side
just decided to take him?

41:51.607 --> 41:53.701
I'd like to believe that's what I saw.

41:53.808 --> 41:55.702
That he's finally gone for good.

41:56.305 --> 41:58.601
<i>I guess we're just
gonna have to wait and see.</i>

41:59.305 --> 42:02.100
I guess we'll just have
to wait and see.
