00:19.152 --> 00:21.086
It's alive!

00:42.075 --> 00:44.339
Oh, my God! What's happening?!

00:44.377 --> 00:46.470
What is it...
look at the size of it!

00:46.513 --> 00:48.276
Why didn't we bring a gun?!

00:48.314 --> 00:49.713
This is the true story...

00:49.749 --> 00:51.546
Of seven strangers...

00:51.584 --> 00:53.575
Picked to live in house...

00:53.620 --> 00:55.212
And have their lives taped...

00:55.255 --> 00:57.917
To find out what happens
when people stop being polite...

00:57.957 --> 01:00.118
and start getting real.

01:00.160 --> 01:03.960
<i>The Real World: Metropolis.</i>

01:03.997 --> 01:05.794
Ugh! People in this hellhole...

01:05.832 --> 01:08.062
just don't respect
personal property.

01:08.101 --> 01:11.593
Listen, I know someone's been
in my underwear drawer.

01:11.638 --> 01:13.469
OK, which one of
you perverts was it?

01:13.506 --> 01:14.598
Because it's sick.

01:14.641 --> 01:16.802
You chicks
are seriously paranoid.

01:16.843 --> 01:20.472
I fold them in a very
particular way, Falcon...

01:20.513 --> 01:21.810
in little squares.

01:21.848 --> 01:23.247
It was probably you.

01:23.283 --> 01:25.979
Aah! It not Hulk! Hulk swear!

01:26.019 --> 01:27.987
Of course it was the Hulk.

01:28.021 --> 01:29.010
Aah!

01:29.055 --> 01:30.647
It was me.

01:30.690 --> 01:33.124
Hello, Kitty!

01:33.159 --> 01:34.421
Raow!

01:34.461 --> 01:38.488
Listen, uh, I don't mean
to be nitpicky or anything...

01:38.531 --> 01:42.331
but, um, the living room hasn't
been vacuumed in weeks and...

01:42.368 --> 01:44.996
Hey, Waterman, I was busy...

01:45.038 --> 01:46.232
you know...

01:46.272 --> 01:49.173
realigning the planet...
or something.

01:49.209 --> 01:52.736
But you drew vacuuming out of
the job jar and everyone else...

01:52.779 --> 01:54.371
Face it.
Who's gonna save Earth...

01:54.414 --> 01:57.281
from a giant meteor
while Superman's vacuuming?

01:57.317 --> 01:59.945
You? I don't think so.

01:59.986 --> 02:01.715
I could.

02:01.754 --> 02:02.914
Hey!

02:02.956 --> 02:05.948
Nobody seems to understand
how useful I am, you know?

02:05.992 --> 02:07.459
I'm... I'm really capable.

02:07.494 --> 02:10.122
I can do lots of stuff,
you know? Lots!

02:10.163 --> 02:13.462
I can do stuff like, um...

02:13.500 --> 02:15.468
Like... like, I can...

02:15.502 --> 02:18.494
You know, I, uh...

02:30.650 --> 02:33.744
They still haven't forgiven me
for that stupid party.

02:35.688 --> 02:37.952
Come on, baby!

02:37.991 --> 02:40.551
Who wants to pet this [Bleep]?

02:43.463 --> 02:47.490
I mean, what is this place,
some kind of nun factory?

02:47.534 --> 02:49.525
I just...

02:50.737 --> 02:51.863
Ha ha.

02:51.905 --> 02:54.499
Got to go! Got to go! Aah!

02:54.541 --> 02:56.839
Hey, uh, occupied. Occupied!

02:56.876 --> 02:57.934
Hey!

03:00.213 --> 03:01.805
Hey. What's up?

03:01.848 --> 03:04.078
Justice never sleeps.

03:04.117 --> 03:06.347
Oh, man, I wanna be red.

03:06.386 --> 03:07.717
I hate black.

03:07.754 --> 03:09.415
Oh, it's like that?

03:09.455 --> 03:12.117
So I'm the token
black superhero, huh?

03:12.158 --> 03:14.183
Well, they might've wanted
Tim Meadows...

03:14.227 --> 03:16.127
but they got the Falcon...

03:16.162 --> 03:19.791
and you damn well better
respect the Falcon.

03:19.832 --> 03:23.461
Of course, I don't really have
any superpowers.

03:23.503 --> 03:25.334
Man, my costume sucks.

03:25.371 --> 03:28.135
Come and get it, little guys.

03:28.174 --> 03:29.471
Hello?

03:30.710 --> 03:32.974
I know you can hear me.
I'm Aquaman.

03:33.012 --> 03:34.639
Trouble at home?

03:36.416 --> 03:38.316
Answer me, you little bitches!

03:38.351 --> 03:40.478
If you leave your towels
on the bathroom floor...

03:40.520 --> 03:42.488
we start getting
that mildew smell.

03:42.522 --> 03:43.955
It's gross!

03:43.990 --> 03:48.017
Have a little common courtesy
for the rest of us.

03:49.028 --> 03:50.962
The bat signal.

03:50.997 --> 03:54.057
Huh. I wonder where he's
always going in such a hurry.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.103
My good plates!

04:08.147 --> 04:09.671
Dishes done.

04:09.716 --> 04:11.308
Despite my best efforts...

04:11.351 --> 04:13.319
fitting in here continues
to be quite a chore.

04:13.353 --> 04:15.617
It... confounds me.

04:15.655 --> 04:18.452
On my plates.
My good china plates.

04:18.491 --> 04:20.959
Relax, Wondergirl.

04:20.994 --> 04:23.963
What did you just call me?

04:23.997 --> 04:25.658
L... I am the night!

04:30.003 --> 04:33.097
Wondergirl? Huh. Wondergirl.

04:33.139 --> 04:35.130
Let me tell you something
about Batman, OK?

04:35.174 --> 04:37.199
He's the same as the rest
of these guys around here.

04:37.243 --> 04:38.574
They're afraid of women.

04:38.611 --> 04:41.136
They're afraid
of the almighty uterus.

04:41.180 --> 04:42.841
Almighty uterus!

04:42.882 --> 04:44.975
Next time on <i>Real World...</i>

04:45.018 --> 04:46.986
I don't see why you're so upset.

04:47.020 --> 04:49.989
What do you need men for
anyway, huh?

04:50.023 --> 04:51.650
How about a smile?

04:51.691 --> 04:53.352
There you go.

04:53.393 --> 04:55.327
I'll do it. I'll do it, man.
I'll totally do it.

04:55.361 --> 04:56.828
You won't do it.

05:00.099 --> 05:02.260
Yahtzee!

05:02.302 --> 05:03.792
That's it!

05:23.089 --> 05:24.351
For America!

05:45.945 --> 05:47.276
Where's the bunny?

05:48.981 --> 05:53.145
Wiggle your big toe.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.244
Great.

05:54.287 --> 05:55.811
I <i>am</i> Jesus, you know.

06:02.895 --> 06:04.123
Hyah!

06:09.502 --> 06:10.526
Oy!

06:22.248 --> 06:25.411
Five-fingered palm of death.

06:26.986 --> 06:29.250
Let me try that again.

06:41.434 --> 06:42.731
Thanks.

06:42.769 --> 06:43.861
It's what I do.

06:57.683 --> 07:00.982
You didn't think it would be
that easy, did you?

07:01.020 --> 07:03.011
For a second there...

07:03.055 --> 07:05.250
yeah, I kind of did.

07:37.423 --> 07:39.891
Your change, sir.

07:39.926 --> 07:42.793
Khan!

07:44.163 --> 07:46.563
Khan!

07:46.599 --> 07:49.727
The next hot game show has
just been imported from Japan.

07:49.769 --> 07:51.703
You want million dollar?!

07:51.737 --> 07:55.104
You win crazy smile face
million dollar!

07:56.342 --> 07:58.333
First, you eat.

07:58.377 --> 07:59.901
Food is power.

07:59.946 --> 08:01.379
The power!

08:01.414 --> 08:03.678
Who poop last?

08:03.716 --> 08:06.276
You win one million
Mr. Mighty Joe dollar...

08:06.319 --> 08:07.786
when you poop last!

08:08.821 --> 08:10.982
Who poop last? Mao! Mao!

08:11.023 --> 08:13.116
<i>Who Poop Last?!</i>

08:20.233 --> 08:22.701
I'm Bill Clinton.
I'm gonna push over that cow.

08:22.735 --> 08:24.566
Ooh, there I go! I did it!
Whoo whoo!

08:25.938 --> 08:29.374
Welcome to another thrilling
edition of <i>Zombie Idol.</i>

08:30.910 --> 08:33.707
Last week, America voted
in record-shattering numbers.

08:33.746 --> 08:35.714
In fact, phone lines
were jammed so badly...

08:35.748 --> 08:39.548
that major metropolitan areas
temporarily lost 911 service.

08:39.585 --> 08:42.179
Hundreds died.

08:42.221 --> 08:44.382
It all started
with the auditions...

08:44.423 --> 08:46.550
as the reanimated corpses
of rock 'n' roll...

08:46.592 --> 08:48.890
all competed
for a spot on our show.

08:48.928 --> 08:51.726
Past performances from zombies
such as John Lennon...

08:51.764 --> 08:54.232
and the Beach Boys
tore up our stage.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.827
Competition
has been hot and heavy.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.894
It's time to meet our judges.

08:58.938 --> 09:01.668
Give it up for Frankenberry.

09:01.707 --> 09:04.505
Yeah. Yeah, dawg. Yeah.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.012
Let's hear it for Boo Berry.

09:07.046 --> 09:09.514
I hope our contestants
just have fun...

09:09.549 --> 09:11.517
and, you know, be themselves...

09:11.551 --> 09:15.009
and pretty,
pretty space people...

09:15.054 --> 09:16.214
and a puppy.

09:16.255 --> 09:18.519
And last
and certainly not least...

09:18.558 --> 09:20.685
please welcome Count Chocula.

09:22.228 --> 09:24.856
Well, I certainly hope
tonight's performances...

09:24.897 --> 09:27.195
are better than last week's
ghastly affair.

09:28.301 --> 09:29.700
Nice outfit.

09:29.735 --> 09:32.966
Isn't it gauche to wear
brown after Labor Day?

09:33.005 --> 09:35.064
I don't know, Ryan.
Isn't it gauche...

09:35.107 --> 09:37.974
to be a complete douchebag
on national TV each week?

09:38.010 --> 09:40.035
Not when you're paid like me.

09:40.079 --> 09:42.206
It's time for our first
performance of the evening.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.045
Here's Bob Marley.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.720
Yeah, dawg. You did your thing.

09:55.761 --> 09:56.887
Marmalade.

09:56.929 --> 09:58.692
Dreadful.

09:58.731 --> 10:00.392
Don't forget
to text message your votes...

10:00.433 --> 10:01.798
at the end of the show...

10:01.834 --> 10:04.359
because phone companies
make far more money that way.

10:04.403 --> 10:05.734
It's time to check in now...

10:05.771 --> 10:08.239
with our very own
roving reporter Kristin Holt.

10:08.274 --> 10:11.175
What kind of hijinks
are going on backstage, Kristin?

10:11.210 --> 10:13.405
Ryan, the zombies
are going wild...

10:13.446 --> 10:16.813
after one of the children from
the Grant-A-Wish Foundation...

10:16.849 --> 10:18.840
fell and cracked his head open.

10:18.884 --> 10:20.579
Brains.

10:20.620 --> 10:24.078
It's like some kind
of feeding frenzy.

10:24.123 --> 10:25.784
L.A. Woman...

10:30.296 --> 10:33.925
There's only one way
to stop a zombie.

10:33.966 --> 10:36.935
Blow their [Bleep]
heads off, baby.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.732
Don't forget
to tell them about...

10:38.771 --> 10:41.262
all the great deals
at Radio Shed, Ving.

10:53.986 --> 10:56.284
Don't forget to vote, everybody.

10:56.322 --> 10:58.290
Good night from <i>Zombie Idol.</i>

10:58.324 --> 10:59.757
Seacrest out.

11:09.268 --> 11:11.600
Brains.
