10:20.640 --> 10:22.600
-Oh, Mr. Maisel... -Right there,
right on the jacket.

10:22.640 --> 10:24.520
-A handprint. Not my handprint.
-I know.

10:24.560 --> 10:26.640
But it is my jacket,
which is now ruined

10:26.680 --> 10:28.600
-because right there, left hand,
clear as day. -I'll find out...

10:28.640 --> 10:31.520
I want you to find out
whose goddamn handprint that is,

10:31.560 --> 10:33.610
and you bring him to me.
Yes? Good? Great.

10:33.650 --> 10:35.230
Uh, good work, ladies.

10:35.280 --> 10:37.240
-Keep 'em hum, hum,
humming along. -Pop?

10:37.280 --> 10:39.110
Love to hear the sound
♪ of the machines. ♪

10:39.160 --> 10:40.620
-You don't look sick.
-Pop?

10:40.660 --> 10:42.160
Miraculous recovery?

10:42.200 --> 10:43.950
Modern science score
another knockout?

10:43.990 --> 10:45.870
-I'm not sick.
-That's not what I heard.

10:45.910 --> 10:47.500
-I heard you were sick.
-MAN: Pin.

10:47.540 --> 10:48.870
-WOMAN: Ow!
-MAN: Quiet.

10:48.920 --> 10:50.420
Mother-in-law called
an hour ago,

10:50.460 --> 10:52.420
said everyone in the family
is sick. Everyone.

10:52.460 --> 10:54.210
What the hell are you doing?

10:54.250 --> 10:56.800
I said halter.
That's a sweetheart.

10:56.840 --> 10:59.590
-Halter! Halter! Halter!
-Sorry, Mr. Maisel.

10:59.630 --> 11:02.760
Your mother-in-law called and
said the whole family is so ill

11:02.800 --> 11:04.680
that break fast is canceled.

11:04.720 --> 11:08.230
So ill, the holiest
of holy days cannot happen.

11:08.270 --> 11:10.560
If it's so holy, why do you keep
the factory open?

11:10.600 --> 11:12.610
-You want a smack in the face?
-I'm just saying.

11:12.650 --> 11:14.070
Those people get paid
by the piece.

11:14.110 --> 11:15.940
You want to take a day's work
away from them?

11:15.980 --> 11:18.650
-God wants them to go hungry
because I shut my doors? -Fine.

11:18.690 --> 11:20.660
Half of those people out there
are gentiles.

11:20.700 --> 11:22.740
You go explain Yom Kippur
to a gentile.

11:22.780 --> 11:24.870
"We're happy,
but we're starving.

11:24.910 --> 11:26.870
It's New Year's,
but we're guilty."

11:26.910 --> 11:28.450
Sounding like a nonbeliever,
Pop.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.460
No, I'm not a nonbeliever.
I am a believer.

11:30.500 --> 11:33.630
I believe that everything I have
is because of Him.

11:33.670 --> 11:35.920
And these, which he gave me.

11:35.960 --> 11:37.670
-It's Abe, right?
-What?

11:37.710 --> 11:39.340
-Abe canceled dinner?
-No.

11:39.380 --> 11:41.630
-Abe's a nonbeliever?
-Abe did not cancel dinner.

11:41.680 --> 11:43.260
That schmuck cancels the dinner.

11:43.300 --> 11:45.350
-A holy dinner, he cancels.
-It's not Abe.

11:45.390 --> 11:47.520
Your mother's very upset.
Does Abe know that?

11:47.560 --> 11:50.440
-It's not Abe. -Yom Kippur is
a very big deal for your mother.

11:50.480 --> 11:52.190
There's kugel,
she sees the kids.

11:52.230 --> 11:53.560
-Yeah, I know. -You think
that happens every day?

11:53.600 --> 11:54.940
You think every day
there's kugel and kids?

11:54.980 --> 11:56.650
-If you'd just...
-Ooh, there was crying.

11:56.690 --> 11:58.320
So much crying.

11:58.360 --> 12:00.190
A good 40 to 50 minutes
of crying.

12:00.240 --> 12:02.410
And finally, I said,
"Shirley, if Abe doesn't

12:02.450 --> 12:03.990
want us at his house,
what are we gonna do?!"

12:04.030 --> 12:07.200
Pop! Please, just stop talking.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.330
I'm not talking.

12:13.250 --> 12:15.670
You're not talking, either.

12:16.840 --> 12:18.710
Quiet's nice sometimes.

12:18.750 --> 12:20.380
I have to tell you something.

12:21.630 --> 12:23.430
Okay.

12:24.680 --> 12:26.430
Midge and I are splitting up.

12:26.470 --> 12:28.390
That's why dinner was canceled.

12:28.430 --> 12:30.390
We split up... last night.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.270
What's her name?

12:33.310 --> 12:34.690
-Who?
-The girl.

12:34.730 --> 12:36.480
-Oh, no, no, no, no.
-Trixie, Dixie...

12:36.520 --> 12:38.480
-It's not like that.
-No?

12:38.520 --> 12:39.940
No! No. It didn't work.

12:39.980 --> 12:41.360
It's nobody's fault.

12:41.400 --> 12:42.990
Sometimes these things happen,
okay?

12:43.030 --> 12:45.280
People with the best
of intentions just grow apart.

12:45.320 --> 12:48.330
That's all.
Just wanted you to know.

12:48.370 --> 12:49.620
That you and Midge split up?

12:49.660 --> 12:51.000
-Yes.
-Okay. Sorry to hear it.

12:51.040 --> 12:52.540
I always liked Midge.

12:52.580 --> 12:54.250
Just not the one, huh?

12:54.290 --> 12:56.170
(Moishe laughs sarcastically)

12:56.210 --> 12:58.210
That's gonna be a hell
of a phone call to your mother.

12:58.250 --> 12:59.960
I'll do it when I get home.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.760
Home? Okay. You'll call
your mother when you get home

13:02.800 --> 13:04.680
and let her know
your marriage is over.

13:04.720 --> 13:07.010
That'll be terrific. Hey!

13:07.050 --> 13:09.310
Don't bother calling
your mother. I'll tell her.

13:09.350 --> 13:11.850
That roll of pink tulle you're
dragging across the ground...

13:11.890 --> 13:13.390
it's French.

13:13.430 --> 13:15.900
Do you know what else is French?
The guillotine!

13:15.940 --> 13:17.270
Turn your back for one minute,

13:17.310 --> 13:20.150
everybody's the village idiot.

13:20.190 --> 13:22.240
Well, at least
Abe's gonna be happy.

13:22.280 --> 13:23.950
-What are you talking about?
-He never thought much of you.

13:23.990 --> 13:25.360
-That's not true.
-No?

13:25.400 --> 13:26.910
Okay. My mistake.

13:26.950 --> 13:28.450
Put it down!

13:28.490 --> 13:29.780
Put it...
Let me see your hand.

13:29.830 --> 13:32.120
Up in the air...
left hand right now!

13:34.210 --> 13:35.960
Morning, Professor.

13:37.250 --> 13:39.670
Good morning,
Professor Weissman.

13:49.140 --> 13:50.600
There it is.

13:50.640 --> 13:52.770
Study it.

13:52.810 --> 13:57.850
Now, this matrix is composed
of two row vectors...

13:57.900 --> 14:00.650
v-one and v-two,
but the rank is only one.

14:00.690 --> 14:02.530
Can anyone tell me why?

14:04.150 --> 14:05.490
No. No.

14:05.530 --> 14:08.110
No. No. Truman?

14:08.160 --> 14:10.410
Because once it's reduced
to echelon form,

14:10.450 --> 14:12.290
there's only one
independent vector.

14:12.330 --> 14:16.790
Correct. Now, can anyone tell me
the nullity of this matrix?

14:18.000 --> 14:21.920
No. No. No. No.

14:21.960 --> 14:24.010
-Truman?
-Unbelievable.

14:24.050 --> 14:28.260
I'm sorry.
Do you have something to say?

14:28.300 --> 14:30.720
You never call on me.
You never call on anyone.

14:30.760 --> 14:32.180
You only ever call on Truman.

14:32.220 --> 14:34.310
Truman knows the answers.

14:34.350 --> 14:36.350
Truman always knows the answers.

14:36.390 --> 14:37.640
Yes, but we could know
the answers.

14:37.690 --> 14:40.190
Really? Did you?

14:40.230 --> 14:42.900
No.

14:42.940 --> 14:45.820
-Did you know the answer?
-No.

14:45.860 --> 14:47.860
No? Did you know the answer?

14:47.900 --> 14:49.410
-No.
-No.

14:49.450 --> 14:51.870
So none of you knew the answer.

14:51.910 --> 14:53.780
-ALL: No.
-But Truman.

14:53.830 --> 14:55.870
But we could have known
the answer. That's the point.

14:55.910 --> 14:57.870
Could have?

14:57.910 --> 15:00.420
Could have. Charlie...

15:00.460 --> 15:05.050
-Lance. -Could have doesn't
count. Maybe doesn't count.

15:05.090 --> 15:07.470
"I took a shot" doesn't count.

15:07.510 --> 15:10.510
Because this room is a sanctuary

15:10.550 --> 15:13.140
from the variables
in the outside world.

15:13.180 --> 15:16.680
In this room,
we deal with absolutes.

15:16.720 --> 15:18.640
Period.

15:18.680 --> 15:20.520
In this room...

15:20.560 --> 15:22.940
this is what counts.

15:24.360 --> 15:27.650
These two vectors are collinear.

15:27.690 --> 15:31.200
They go... together.

15:31.240 --> 15:33.910
And they will always
go together.

15:33.950 --> 15:37.450
This is the solemn vow
made by mathematics.

15:37.500 --> 15:41.920
In this room, v-two is never
going to break that vow

15:41.960 --> 15:44.420
and decide that it doesn't need
the other vector anymore,

15:44.460 --> 15:47.420
that it's gonna run off
and become linearly independent.

15:47.460 --> 15:50.220
V-two is never going
to come home from work one day

15:50.260 --> 15:52.970
and tell v-one,
"You know what?

15:53.010 --> 15:56.310
"I think
I need my own vector space.

15:56.350 --> 15:58.640
See ya."

15:58.680 --> 16:01.980
And then v-one's dad has
to come in and tell her, "No,

16:02.020 --> 16:03.850
"you can't let v-two do that.

16:03.900 --> 16:06.690
You-you got
to go get v-two back,"

16:06.730 --> 16:08.360
an impermanent solution,

16:08.400 --> 16:12.910
because v-one's dad is not
gonna be around forever

16:12.950 --> 16:16.870
to solve all
of v-one's problems.

16:16.910 --> 16:18.830
(chalk writing on board)

16:21.540 --> 16:23.120
Write that down.

16:28.590 --> 16:33.680

Iris is sweet ♪

16:33.720 --> 16:37.760

16:53.150 --> 16:57.370

17:00.450 --> 17:03.290
And just like that, Joel left,
in the middle of the night,

17:03.330 --> 17:05.420
-like a cat burglar.
-DRINA: God, that's terrible.

17:05.460 --> 17:07.000
I'm so surprised. He seemed

17:07.040 --> 17:09.250
so crazy about Midge.
You want sugar today?

17:09.300 --> 17:10.920
No. Maybe a lump.

17:10.960 --> 17:12.510
-Two lumps.
-I put in three.

17:12.550 --> 17:14.430
It's a stressful time.

17:14.470 --> 17:16.180
-Drink.
-Mm.

17:18.050 --> 17:20.010
How is poor Miriam?

17:20.060 --> 17:21.810
Oh, who can tell with her?

17:21.849 --> 17:23.890
You know,
maybe I sensed something.

17:23.930 --> 17:26.560
But just last week, I told her
to get pregnant again.

17:26.599 --> 17:28.270
Hmm. Too hot.

17:28.310 --> 17:30.610
I told her, "Three before 30."
That was my mistake.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.610
I waited too long
between Miriam and Noah.

17:32.650 --> 17:35.150
-I could only fit in two. -You
need to drink the tea, honey.

17:35.200 --> 17:36.570
But Miriam is Miriam.

17:36.610 --> 17:38.370
She wanted to play
and run around

17:38.410 --> 17:41.160
dressed in black
like a Fellini film.

17:41.200 --> 17:43.000
It's fine now.

17:43.040 --> 17:44.710
There's beer
in her refrigerator.

17:44.750 --> 17:46.580
-Oh, dear.
-Joel thinks she's frivolous.

17:46.620 --> 17:48.830
-That's why he left.
-She's always been her own girl.

17:48.880 --> 17:51.460
-Mm. -Do you remember when
she wanted to learn to drive?

17:51.500 --> 17:53.460
Because she found
pink driving gloves.

17:53.510 --> 17:55.420
Everything with Midge starts
with an accessory.

17:55.470 --> 17:57.090
How's Abe taking all this?

17:57.130 --> 17:59.010
Abe got up this morning
and went to work.

17:59.050 --> 18:01.720
The world could be ending,
and he'd get up and go to work.

18:01.760 --> 18:03.970
And if Columbia University fell
into the ocean,

18:04.020 --> 18:06.270
he'd work from home.

18:07.520 --> 18:10.020
-Here.
-Does the rabbi know?

18:10.060 --> 18:11.570
-What? No. God, no.
-Good.

18:11.610 --> 18:14.070
-Can you imagine?
-I don't want to.

18:14.110 --> 18:15.490
We're all sick.
That's what he knows.

18:15.530 --> 18:17.200
Very, very sick.
You did not see me today.

18:17.240 --> 18:19.950
Who am I talking to?
No one. I'm alone here.

18:19.990 --> 18:22.620
Okay, let's take a look at this.

18:22.660 --> 18:24.410
I failed her.
I failed her somehow.

18:24.450 --> 18:25.910
My whole family,
everyone's married.

18:25.960 --> 18:27.830
Abe's family,
everyone's married.

18:27.870 --> 18:30.460
I should've sent her to Paris.
My mother sent me to Paris.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.300
Paris is wonderful,
but it's good Midge didn't go.

18:33.340 --> 18:35.090
There was danger for her there.

18:35.130 --> 18:37.340
-Too much bread.
-Yes.

18:37.380 --> 18:39.090
Okay, let's see.

18:39.130 --> 18:40.970
I just need
to know whether or not

18:41.010 --> 18:42.760
this separation is actually
going to happen.

18:42.810 --> 18:44.520
-I see a hammer.
-Is a hammer good?

18:44.560 --> 18:46.100
It is if you want
to hang a picture.

18:46.140 --> 18:48.020
Please, DRINA...

18:48.060 --> 18:51.060
A hammer means triumph.
You will triumph.

18:51.110 --> 18:57.030
And the leaves say this journey
will end in peace and happiness.

18:57.070 --> 18:59.780
Triumph? Peace and happiness?
You're sure?

18:59.820 --> 19:02.320
-You're doubting the leaves?
-No. Never.

19:02.370 --> 19:04.540
Okay, you're still nervous.
DRINA knows this.

19:04.580 --> 19:06.120
I'll tell you what.

19:06.160 --> 19:08.410
I'll throw in a charm.
Put this

19:08.460 --> 19:11.670
under Miriam's pillow
for a week.

19:11.710 --> 19:13.250
It'll help the luck stick.

19:13.290 --> 19:14.920
My God, what is that smell?

19:14.960 --> 19:16.300
Tannis root.
Just tell Miriam

19:16.340 --> 19:18.550
a rat died
in the wall or something.

19:18.590 --> 19:20.630
-Thank you, DRINA.
-Don't worry.

19:20.680 --> 19:22.760
Miriam will land on her feet.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.560
Take it from me.

19:26.220 --> 19:28.980
Hmm? Are you paying
by check today?

19:34.060 --> 19:36.030
ANTONIO: Hey, Mrs. Maisel!
Hold on a sec!

19:36.070 --> 19:38.110
-What's wrong? -Some guy showed
up here looking for you.

19:38.150 --> 19:40.700
I asked him to wait down here,
but he pushed right past.

19:40.740 --> 19:42.410
-Almost bit me.
-Oh, no.

19:42.450 --> 19:44.580
-Hey, I'm calling the cops
right now. -Don't call the cops.

19:44.620 --> 19:46.330
Everything's fine!

19:46.370 --> 19:50.000
-Good morning, Mrs. Maisel.
-Good morning.

19:50.040 --> 19:52.960
(elevator bell dings)

19:53.000 --> 19:54.380
I'm sorry.

19:54.420 --> 19:55.710
-Are you fucking kidding me?
-I know.

19:55.750 --> 19:57.460
-I know.
-9:30.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.800
I got up at 9:30.
In the morning.

19:59.840 --> 20:01.800
You know the last time I was up
at 9:30 in the morning?

20:01.840 --> 20:03.220
It was the last time
I stayed out all night

20:03.260 --> 20:04.890
and got home at 9:30
in the morning.

20:04.930 --> 20:07.220
That is the last time I was up
at 9:30 in the morning.

20:07.260 --> 20:08.640
I'm sorry. It was a rough night.

20:08.680 --> 20:10.390
Hey, you came to me, okay?

20:10.430 --> 20:11.940
You know, I-I didn't ask you
to bang on my door.

20:11.980 --> 20:13.190
I didn't even tell you
where my door was.

20:13.230 --> 20:14.730
You figured out where it was

20:14.770 --> 20:16.400
and then you came there
and then you banged on it

20:16.440 --> 20:18.070
-of your own free will.
-I forgot.

20:18.110 --> 20:19.820
Oh, much better.

20:19.860 --> 20:21.820
It is so much better
that you just forgot.

20:21.860 --> 20:23.410
You know, my fear
was that you remembered

20:23.450 --> 20:25.240
and chose not to meet me.

20:25.280 --> 20:27.830
But now that I know I literally
didn't even enter into y...

20:27.870 --> 20:30.830
Wh-Where the hell are we? What
is this, fucking Versailles?

20:30.870 --> 20:32.080
It's my apartment.

20:32.120 --> 20:33.460
Your table is set for 30.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.000
Who has cutlery for 30?

20:35.040 --> 20:37.670
Jesus Christ,
what is this, a landing strip?

20:37.710 --> 20:39.380
Where is your airplane,
in the bathroom?

20:39.420 --> 20:41.380
I had no idea you were such
an important person.

20:41.420 --> 20:43.720
If I had realized that the queen
of England had stood me up,

20:43.760 --> 20:45.550
I would have understood.
But I just thought

20:45.590 --> 20:47.390
you were some drunk housewife
who needed my help.

20:47.430 --> 20:51.730
I had no idea you were related
to fucking Charlemagne.

20:51.770 --> 20:53.390
'Cause if Catherine the Great
had shown up and said,

20:53.440 --> 20:55.230
"Hey, let's meet at 10:00," I
probably wouldn't have expected

20:55.270 --> 20:58.230
her to show up either. But you
have to tell people who you are.

20:58.270 --> 20:59.980
'Cause if all they have to go on
is the fact

21:00.030 --> 21:01.820
that you make appointments
and then forget about them,

21:01.860 --> 21:03.570
they're just gonna think
you're a stuck-up twat.

21:03.610 --> 21:05.070
It's an easy mistake to make.

21:05.110 --> 21:06.820
I almost made that same mistake.

21:06.870 --> 21:09.080
But then I saw your dining room
was set for Parliament...

21:09.120 --> 21:11.080
What the... What is this,

21:11.120 --> 21:14.160
a backup place in case you get
bored with the other one?

21:14.210 --> 21:15.920
What the hell is going on here?

21:15.960 --> 21:18.250
-They've already eaten,
Miss Miriam. -Thank you, Zelda.

21:18.290 --> 21:20.090
Hey, Zelda, have you seen
the place downstairs?

21:20.130 --> 21:21.920
-It will blow your mind.
-Hi, lady.

21:21.960 --> 21:23.260
What? Where are we going?

21:23.300 --> 21:24.630
Why am I touching this child?

21:24.680 --> 21:26.300
-Why is this child touching me?
-Hi, lady.

21:26.340 --> 21:28.640
Why is his hand sticky?
Why is your hand sticky?

21:28.680 --> 21:32.430
Where has his hand been that
it is now currently very sticky?

21:32.470 --> 21:33.980
(elevator bell dings)

21:34.020 --> 21:36.350
-Hi, lady. -Why am I
still holding this child?

21:36.400 --> 21:38.020
He can't find his way home
from here?

21:38.060 --> 21:39.900
I made it home just fine
when my mother forgot me

21:39.940 --> 21:41.320
at the Armistice Day Parade.

21:41.360 --> 21:43.150
An old soldier with one arm
gave me a nickel

21:43.190 --> 21:45.150
and I took the bus home.
Oh, you're welcome!

21:45.200 --> 21:47.780
Real polite kid you got there.
Good job.

21:47.820 --> 21:49.200
Would you like some iced tea?

21:49.240 --> 21:50.780
Hmm. Do I want some iced tea?

21:50.830 --> 21:52.410
Let me think. Fuck you.

21:52.450 --> 21:55.080
No, I do not want any iced tea.

21:55.120 --> 21:57.080
(scoffs)
First, you stand me up.

21:57.120 --> 21:59.750
Then you Bataan Death March me
through Buckingham Palace.

21:59.790 --> 22:01.500
You make me hold
your kid's filthy hand,

22:01.550 --> 22:03.300
which means I probably got
14 different kinds of cholera

22:03.340 --> 22:05.300
-right now. -Sit down.
I'll get us some iced tea.

22:05.340 --> 22:07.550
Sit where? Here? What, on this?
Are you kidding me?

22:07.590 --> 22:08.890
I'm not sitting in here.

22:08.930 --> 22:10.220
This is not furniture
for sitting!

22:10.260 --> 22:11.640
This is furniture
you get appraised

22:11.680 --> 22:12.970
when a rich uncle dies.

22:13.020 --> 22:14.560
You really should put plastic

22:14.600 --> 22:16.350
-over all of this.
-It's fine.

22:16.390 --> 22:18.270
Are those two
really your children

22:18.310 --> 22:20.610
or did we just break in
and kidnap a couple kids?

22:20.650 --> 22:23.280
-Of course they're mine.
-Well, just making sure.

22:23.320 --> 22:25.280
I mean, when you fraternize
with an ex-con...

22:25.320 --> 22:27.860
Hey, did you know that I have
to get a lawyer and go to court?

22:27.910 --> 22:30.870
-Yes. -Even though I got bailed
out on the night I got arrested.

22:30.910 --> 22:32.700
What the hell does that
have to do with anything?

22:32.740 --> 22:35.200
-So it's not a thing?
-No, it's not a thing.

22:35.250 --> 22:37.160
Why do I have it in my head
that it's a thing?

22:37.210 --> 22:40.000
I don't know, lady. Maybe
it's all that royal inbreeding.

22:40.040 --> 22:42.340
-This is not that fancy
of an apartment. -(chuckles)

22:42.380 --> 22:44.760
It's just ridiculous. That
whole getting arrested thing.

22:44.800 --> 22:46.420
So I said some bad words.

22:46.470 --> 22:47.930
Well, and you flashed the room.

22:47.970 --> 22:49.180
What?

22:49.220 --> 22:50.430
You flashed the room.

22:50.470 --> 22:51.680
You pulled your top down.

22:51.720 --> 22:53.680
-Oh, I did not.
-You did, too.

22:53.720 --> 22:55.680
You hit a switch
and out they came.

22:55.720 --> 22:57.270
-That's ridiculous.
-"Soup's on, boys!"

22:57.310 --> 22:59.270
-If I did that, I'd remember.
-Mm.

22:59.310 --> 23:01.440
-Cake?
-No, I do not want cake.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.520
You know what, I would like
to know what I am doing...

23:03.570 --> 23:04.610
Oh, wow.

23:04.650 --> 23:06.360
That-that is an adorable cake.

23:06.400 --> 23:07.900
I'm sorry about today.

23:07.950 --> 23:09.240
I really am.

23:09.280 --> 23:10.820
Okay.

23:10.860 --> 23:13.160
Let's just forget
about this morning, okay?

23:13.200 --> 23:15.620
I'm here. We can start now.

23:15.660 --> 23:16.870
You have any paper? Pen?

23:16.910 --> 23:19.370
Maybe parchment and a quill?

23:19.410 --> 23:20.750
-Why? -So I can write down
some stuff for you

23:20.790 --> 23:22.380
-to talk about onstage.
-No, no, no.

23:22.420 --> 23:23.790
Look, I'm-I'm sorry
about this morning,

23:23.840 --> 23:25.380
but that woman last night,

23:25.420 --> 23:26.630
she was not me.

23:26.670 --> 23:28.550
This is me. I am me.

23:28.590 --> 23:30.260
-Uh-huh. -I'm the woman
who's gonna be standing

23:30.300 --> 23:32.260
in the corner
next to Martha Kilgallin,

23:32.300 --> 23:34.560
-desperate and sweating
like a pig. -There are two Ls

23:34.600 --> 23:36.640
-in "Kilgallin"? -I'm the woman
who's gonna get elbowed

23:36.680 --> 23:38.480
out of the way at the butcher
shop so that other women

23:38.520 --> 23:40.390
can get the best lamb chops.
Other women who have husbands

23:40.440 --> 23:43.150
to shop for. Nobody cares if
you're ordering steak for one.

23:43.190 --> 23:45.570
That-That's me. That's
the real me we're dealing with.

23:45.610 --> 23:48.650
And she's not fun.
She's sad and embarrassed

23:48.690 --> 23:50.320
and poten... What are you doing?

23:50.360 --> 23:51.700
I'm making notes.
This is great stuff.

23:51.740 --> 23:53.120
This is not great stuff.

23:53.160 --> 23:55.450
This is my life falling apart.

23:55.490 --> 23:57.660
My husband left me.
Do you understand that?

23:57.700 --> 24:00.250
He left me, left my children.
You've met my children.

24:00.290 --> 24:02.210
I did. One of 'em gave me
bubonic plague.

24:02.250 --> 24:04.210
It was jelly, goddamn it.
Children get jelly

24:04.250 --> 24:06.340
-on their hands.
-Okay. Relax.

24:06.380 --> 24:08.510
The woman who showed up at that
club and said those crazy things

24:08.550 --> 24:09.760
was in a state.

24:09.800 --> 24:11.970
A manic emotional state.

24:12.010 --> 24:13.430
Bullshit. You loved it.

24:13.470 --> 24:16.510
Yes! For a moment
it-it was glorious, okay?

24:16.560 --> 24:18.600
F-For one moment,
I said and did things

24:18.640 --> 24:20.600
that I've never done
or said before.

24:20.640 --> 24:22.690
But-but that is all
a complete blur to me now.

24:22.730 --> 24:24.940
I don't know how I got there.

24:24.980 --> 24:26.440
I wouldn't know
how to get there again.

24:26.480 --> 24:29.110
And I'm not gonna try.
Do you understand?

24:30.150 --> 24:31.530
Yeah.

24:31.570 --> 24:33.860
I understand.

24:33.910 --> 24:35.950
Made me come all the way
to the Upper West Side.

24:35.990 --> 24:37.740
Didn't even have
a doctor's appointment.

24:37.780 --> 24:38.830
Wait.

24:53.430 --> 24:55.430
For the bail.

25:01.520 --> 25:03.520
See ya.

25:12.530 --> 25:14.200
(sighs)

25:17.200 --> 25:19.080
Not too many fatty pieces.
It's all he'll eat.

25:19.120 --> 25:20.490
Yes, Mrs. Weissman.

25:20.540 --> 25:22.120
The rest can be leftovers
for tomorrow.

25:22.160 --> 25:23.540
(phone rings)

25:23.580 --> 25:26.540
Abe! Dinner's on the table!

25:26.580 --> 25:28.040
Hello?

25:28.090 --> 25:30.130
Rosie? Oh, my God,
Rosie, is that you?

25:30.170 --> 25:31.550
Yes, it's me, Shirley.

25:31.590 --> 25:33.300
Rosie, I'm beside myself.

25:33.340 --> 25:35.470
I feel like a building
just fell on my head.

25:35.510 --> 25:37.090
A block. A whole block.

25:37.140 --> 25:39.430
I feel like 34th
between Sixth and Seventh

25:39.470 --> 25:41.680
just fell right on my head.

25:41.720 --> 25:43.020
I thought
dinner was on the table.

25:43.060 --> 25:44.690
Calm down. You sound winded.

25:44.730 --> 25:46.520
I see carrots, potatoes...

25:46.560 --> 25:48.520
Oh, hey,
the salad's on the table.

25:48.560 --> 25:50.110
-I'm talking to Shirley.
-Shirley?

25:50.150 --> 25:51.610
-Mm.
-Oh, great. Tell her to hang on.

25:51.650 --> 25:53.030
I want to put her
on speakerphone.

25:53.070 --> 25:54.820
Shirley, will you hold on
just one minute?

25:54.860 --> 25:56.320
You're not hanging up on me,
are you?

25:56.360 --> 25:57.820
No, I'll be right back.

25:57.860 --> 26:00.410
People think I'm such
a strong person, but I'm not.

26:00.450 --> 26:02.490
Hurry, before she hangs herself
with the phone cord.

26:02.540 --> 26:05.410
Okay. And... go.

26:05.460 --> 26:07.420
Shirley, are you still there?

26:07.460 --> 26:09.170
-Barely.
-Okay, good.

26:09.210 --> 26:10.540
Go ahead. You were saying?

26:10.590 --> 26:13.420
I was saying my heart is broken.

26:13.460 --> 26:15.840
-(quietly): Excellent. -What?
-Nothing. Go ahead, Shirley.

26:15.880 --> 26:17.840
I didn't get to have
my Yom Kippur dinner.

26:17.880 --> 26:19.590
It was ripped out from under me.

26:19.640 --> 26:22.510
Just like when we went to Boca
and we saw this magician

26:22.560 --> 26:23.930
and he ripped a tablecloth out

26:23.970 --> 26:26.270
from under
a completely set table.

26:26.310 --> 26:28.600
Only in my case,
everything falls to the floor

26:28.650 --> 26:31.110
and smashes
into a million pieces.

26:31.150 --> 26:32.110
Tell her to speak up a little.

26:32.150 --> 26:33.530
Shirley, dear,
could you speak up?

26:33.570 --> 26:36.110
I look forward to that dinner
all year!

26:36.150 --> 26:39.110
But then I heard you all had
such a terrible flu.

26:39.160 --> 26:41.370
My heart stopped.
I mean, the flu is very serious.

26:41.410 --> 26:43.790
People die from the flu.
But when Moishe told me

26:43.830 --> 26:46.290
you didn't actually have
the flu, I was so relieved.

26:46.330 --> 26:48.370
"Thank God, I don't have
to worry about that."

26:48.420 --> 26:50.290
But then he said
the kids split up,

26:50.330 --> 26:53.550
and suddenly I just wished
everybody had the flu.

26:53.590 --> 26:55.050
-Split up?
-Now what do I have?

26:55.090 --> 26:56.550
No Yom Kippur.

26:56.590 --> 26:57.550
No daughter-in-law.

26:57.590 --> 26:59.380
No grandchildren.

26:59.430 --> 27:01.010
You'll always have
the grandchildren.

27:01.050 --> 27:02.890
Oh, well, sure,
yes, as a concept, but...

27:02.930 --> 27:06.220
Shirley, when did you hear
the kids were breaking up?

27:06.270 --> 27:07.850
-Just now.
-You're sure?

27:07.890 --> 27:10.690
Yes. Joel came to see Moishe
this afternoon and...

27:10.730 --> 27:13.230
Wait, who is this?
Who am I talking to?

27:13.270 --> 27:15.230
That was Abe, Shirley.
Now, try and calm down.

27:15.280 --> 27:16.990
I promise you'll see
the grandchildren again.

27:17.030 --> 27:19.780
When? When am I gonna see
them again?

27:19.820 --> 27:21.950
Next Yom Kippur? What am I, 20?

27:21.990 --> 27:23.620
I could be dead in an hour!

27:23.660 --> 27:26.200
I hear there's a terrible flu
going around.

27:26.240 --> 27:29.000
No, the flu wasn't real,
Shirley. The flu was an excuse.

27:29.040 --> 27:31.920
Now people need an excuse
not to see family?

27:31.960 --> 27:33.590
What a world.

27:33.630 --> 27:35.590
She didn't go to him.
I told Miriam to go to him

27:35.630 --> 27:37.420
-and she didn't go to him.
-Abe, Abe...

27:37.460 --> 27:39.340
-Who?
-Uh, nothing, Shirley, I'm here.

27:39.380 --> 27:41.840
I just wish
we could all be together

27:41.890 --> 27:43.180
just one more time.

27:43.220 --> 27:44.760
One dinner.

27:44.810 --> 27:46.100
I know, Shirley.

27:46.140 --> 27:47.100
One dinner.

27:47.140 --> 27:48.730
So we can celebrate
the new year.

27:48.770 --> 27:50.690
So I can see my grandchildren
again.

27:50.730 --> 27:52.900
So we can... be a family.

27:52.940 --> 27:54.820
I hear you, Shirley.
Now let me let you go.

27:54.860 --> 27:57.400
I promise I will speak to Miriam
and then we'll talk later.

27:57.440 --> 27:58.900
I'm gonna try her now.
Bye, Rose.

27:58.940 --> 28:00.240

-Oh, n... Shirley.

28:00.280 --> 28:01.570

-Oh... (grunts)

28:19.380 --> 28:22.260
Zelda! Open the door!

28:22.300 --> 28:25.050
Open the door!

28:25.100 --> 28:27.720

I promise you. -(panting)

Well, that's not true, Shirley.

the children before you die.

28:37.110 --> 28:38.400

28:38.440 --> 28:40.400
Yes, of cour...
Yes, they love you.

28:40.440 --> 28:44.110
And they miss you.
Yes, I'm-I'm very, very sure.

Oh, of course.

28:49.830 --> 28:52.540

28:52.580 --> 28:54.460
Thursday dinner will be fine.

All right. Yes. Uh-huh.
Okay. Bye-bye, Shirley.

(sighs) What a terrible place
the inside of her head must be.

29:05.800 --> 29:07.350
I tried to warn you.

29:07.390 --> 29:09.100
You have so many nines
in your number.

29:09.140 --> 29:11.850
-Thursday night?
-Thursday night.

29:11.890 --> 29:13.390
Well, I can get you out of it.

29:13.440 --> 29:14.440
Really? How?

29:14.480 --> 29:16.270
I don't know. And Joel?

29:16.310 --> 29:18.150
-He is expected.
-Should I call him for you?

29:18.190 --> 29:19.820
You really think Shirley
hasn't gotten to him already?

29:19.860 --> 29:21.070
You're right.

29:21.110 --> 29:23.320
(sighs)

29:23.360 --> 29:24.740
It'll be fine.

29:24.780 --> 29:25.910
I'll have to see him eventually.

29:25.950 --> 29:27.570
I mean, we have the children.

29:27.620 --> 29:29.700
We'll just... have to be adults.

29:29.740 --> 29:30.870
And what are you gonna wear?

29:30.910 --> 29:32.790
-Why?
-Wear your red dress.

29:32.830 --> 29:34.540
That's an evening dress.

29:34.580 --> 29:35.750
It's dinner. That's evening.

29:35.790 --> 29:37.290
-Mama...
-If you have to see Joel,

29:37.330 --> 29:38.880
then he has to see you,
and if he has to see you,

29:38.920 --> 29:40.090
he should see what he's missing.

29:40.130 --> 29:41.800
That is not what
this dinner's for.

29:41.840 --> 29:43.050
You're a single woman now.

plus, she makes
a terrific cup of coffee.

31:42.210 --> 31:43.630
We just thought
this would be a good fit,

Penny's gone? Fired?

But fuck me, you're my son.

Gougères. French cheese puffs.

34:52.150 --> 34:54.360
French food is salty.
Is that on purpose?

34:54.400 --> 34:56.070

-Did you know

37:11.960 --> 37:14.170
You're a guest.

37:14.210 --> 37:16.210
-What is that?
-Chicken soup.

37:16.250 --> 37:17.500
Where did that come from?

37:17.540 --> 37:19.340
I put it in the freezer
last time I was here.

37:19.380 --> 37:21.010
Oh, do you have any matzo meal?

37:21.050 --> 37:22.590
Never mind,
I have some in my purse.

37:22.630 --> 37:24.800
I think I brought some...

37:27.010 --> 37:28.100
Mmm.

37:34.890 --> 37:36.400
Stop there.

37:37.940 --> 37:40.780
I am not a violent man, Joel.

37:40.820 --> 37:43.190
But if I were, I would take you
upstairs to my apartment

37:43.240 --> 37:44.700
and throw you out the window.

37:44.740 --> 37:46.490
Do you know why I'm not throwing
you out this window?

37:46.530 --> 37:47.870
-No.
-Because my window

37:47.910 --> 37:50.410
is on a higher floor and
I want to make sure it sticks.

37:50.450 --> 37:51.870
-Abe...
-No.

37:51.910 --> 37:53.450
You do not call me Abe.

37:53.500 --> 37:55.210
-What do I call you?
-Nothing.

37:55.250 --> 37:57.460
You call me nothing.

37:57.500 --> 37:59.500
You don't talk to me
or look at me.

37:59.540 --> 38:02.550
If you see me on the street,
you will cross the street,

38:02.590 --> 38:04.550
whether or not there is
a crosswalk present.

38:04.590 --> 38:07.510
Your pedestrian safety is
of no importance to me anymore.

38:07.550 --> 38:09.600
-I...
-You what? You're sorry?

38:09.640 --> 38:12.310
You didn't mean to do what
you did? It just happened?

38:12.350 --> 38:14.560
You have children, Joel.

38:14.600 --> 38:18.100
-You made promises.
-I know.

38:20.480 --> 38:24.780
(whispers):
Ah, you stupid, stupid boy.

38:27.410 --> 38:31.240
Where are you going to find
a girl like Miriam again?

38:38.370 --> 38:40.920
-Dinner's ready, Papa.
-Uh-huh.

38:40.960 --> 38:42.300
Can I help you with that?

38:42.340 --> 38:45.300
Oh, uh, I've got it.

38:45.340 --> 38:47.430
You look really
beautiful tonight.

38:47.470 --> 38:49.010
Well, I've got
an armful of meat.

38:49.050 --> 38:51.220
Yeah, that can't hurt.

38:52.890 --> 38:55.310
We should probably
figure out some logistics.

38:55.350 --> 38:56.890
Logistics?

38:56.930 --> 38:59.310
You have things here. Clothes.

38:59.350 --> 39:01.310
I can pack them all up for you,
if you'd like.

39:01.360 --> 39:03.020
Okay... (sighs)

39:03.070 --> 39:05.940
Can I come by
and see the kids sometimes?

39:05.990 --> 39:07.150
I'll take 'em out
so I'm not here.

39:07.200 --> 39:10.450
Of course.
You're their dad.

39:10.490 --> 39:13.330
They love you.
We'll figure something out.

39:13.370 --> 39:14.370
-We're sitting down, Shirley.
-I know.

39:14.410 --> 39:15.410
I just wanted
to do one more thing...

39:15.450 --> 39:17.000
You've done so much already.

39:17.040 --> 39:19.750
Dinner, everyone. Move.

39:19.790 --> 39:23.880
♪ I won't know sweet music ♪

39:23.920 --> 39:27.720
♪ Until you return ♪

39:27.760 --> 39:32.680
♪ Someday. ♪

39:32.720 --> 39:34.350
Abe, I know
this is your gathering,

39:34.390 --> 39:36.520
but I'd like to take a moment
to talk about family.

39:36.560 --> 39:37.930
-Terrific.
-I know we're going through

39:37.980 --> 39:39.850
a rough, rough time,
and I just want to

39:39.890 --> 39:42.480
thank everyone
for coming together tonight.

39:42.520 --> 39:44.730
-Do you smell something burning?
-Because by coming together

39:44.770 --> 39:46.110
under these trying circumstances

39:46.150 --> 39:47.570
we're showing future
generations,

39:47.610 --> 39:50.320
your Ethans, your Esthers,
that in times of hardships,

39:50.360 --> 39:52.370
self-sacrifice
is often necessary.

39:52.410 --> 39:56.870
Like the sacrifice I made
pulling 13 Jews out of Germany

39:56.910 --> 39:59.370
-in 1943.
-ABE and MIDGE: Here we go.

39:59.410 --> 40:02.000
I got that call, I didn't know
who these people were,

40:02.040 --> 40:03.750
I didn't know how to do it,
I just knew there were

40:03.790 --> 40:06.300
13 Jews that wanted
out of Germany,

40:06.340 --> 40:08.420
and I was the man
to get them out.

40:08.460 --> 40:11.720
At great cost.
What I paid per head.

40:11.760 --> 40:13.390
-Okay, time to eat.
-MOISHE: Anyhow,

40:13.430 --> 40:14.890
the other day,
sitting in temple,

40:14.930 --> 40:16.970
looking at all the empty
seats next to us...

40:17.010 --> 40:18.680
seats we paid for
as a family...

40:18.720 --> 40:20.020
I was filled with great sadness.

40:20.060 --> 40:21.350
(exaggerated sigh)

40:21.390 --> 40:22.810
Something wrong, Abe?

40:22.850 --> 40:24.860
Seats I paid for, actually.

40:24.900 --> 40:26.230
You were going
to pay me back...

40:26.270 --> 40:27.440
Oh, so it's about money.

40:27.480 --> 40:28.610
I didn't realize
you were hurting.

40:28.650 --> 40:29.900
I'm not hurting.

40:29.940 --> 40:31.740
I'm just saying
we had an agreement.

40:31.780 --> 40:32.860
Well, you seem to have
a nice life,

40:32.910 --> 40:33.910
you've got your lovely home,

40:33.950 --> 40:35.280
you've got your servant here.

40:35.320 --> 40:37.030
Zelda is not a servant,
she's an employee.

40:37.080 --> 40:38.580
-She's family.
-Family, too.

40:38.620 --> 40:40.710
And well-paid,
with vacation time.

40:40.750 --> 40:42.210
She went to Holland
last year.

40:42.250 --> 40:44.130
-Iceland.
-Iceland. Better than Holland.

40:44.170 --> 40:46.000
In ancient times,
we were the slaves.

40:46.040 --> 40:48.880
-We don't own slaves.
-I don't own her!

40:48.920 --> 40:51.420
Can we all just calm down,
eat some soup?

40:51.470 --> 40:53.050
This is ridiculous!
Are we really just going to

40:53.090 --> 40:54.840
sit here and pretend everyone's
having a nice evening?

40:54.890 --> 40:56.140
We're not having a nice evening.

40:56.180 --> 40:57.810
Fine, then I'll say it.
The separation...

40:57.850 --> 41:00.770
this ridiculous breakup...
it's not going to happen.

41:00.810 --> 41:02.890
This is not the place
to have this conversation.

41:02.940 --> 41:04.310
No one's talking to you.

41:04.350 --> 41:06.060
What are you gonna
do about it, Abe, hmm?

41:06.110 --> 41:08.610
Going to let Miriam here
just suddenly drift along

41:08.650 --> 41:10.110
without a husband
to protect her?

41:10.150 --> 41:11.610
She's gonna do what
with her life?

41:11.650 --> 41:13.610
Sit around all day long
eating Bon-bons,

41:13.650 --> 41:15.450
watching Queen For A Day.

41:15.490 --> 41:17.620
-Is that what you want for her?
-Of course not!

41:17.660 --> 41:18.830
-That's what's gonna happen.
-It's not!

41:18.870 --> 41:20.290
-Is too!
-I'm going back to school!

41:20.330 --> 41:22.290
-What?
-School?!

41:22.330 --> 41:23.830
Everybody, please,
just calm down, calm down.

41:23.870 --> 41:26.040
All this anger
and emotion is pointless.

41:26.080 --> 41:29.380
The leaves said that
the separation will not happen.

41:29.420 --> 41:33.340
It's all going to end
in peace and happiness.

41:40.810 --> 41:42.850
Can I see you two
in the bedroom a minute?

41:47.150 --> 41:51.400
You swore to me you wouldn't
see that crackpot anymore.

41:51.440 --> 41:53.610
Drina's a friend,
and she's very gifted.

41:53.650 --> 41:55.450
She reads sediment.
And you,

41:55.490 --> 41:57.870
I told you to go get him back.

41:57.910 --> 41:58.870
What?

41:58.910 --> 42:00.240
I told you to fix your face,

42:00.280 --> 42:01.870
put on a nice dress
and get him back.

42:01.910 --> 42:03.160
-What happened?
-I...

42:03.200 --> 42:04.460
You forgot how to
fix your face?

42:04.500 --> 42:05.920
-You couldn't find a dress?
-No.

42:05.960 --> 42:08.210
-Then what?
-I don't want him here

42:08.250 --> 42:09.210
if he doesn't want
to be here.

42:09.250 --> 42:10.670
Of course you do.

42:10.710 --> 42:11.960
You want him here
no matter what

42:12.000 --> 42:13.300
he thinks or feels or wants.

42:13.340 --> 42:15.050
-No.
-Miriam,

42:15.090 --> 42:18.550
because of you, we are stuck
in this house with that man

42:18.590 --> 42:21.310
and his bloviating
and speeches.

42:21.350 --> 42:23.600
And I have to say,
if he talks about getting

42:23.640 --> 42:26.600
those 13 Jews out of Germany
one more time...

42:26.640 --> 42:28.480
-Abe...
-He brought them here

42:28.520 --> 42:30.270
and stuck them
in his factory.

42:30.310 --> 42:31.900
They're all working there.

42:31.940 --> 42:33.530
Is he paying
these poor people?

42:33.570 --> 42:36.030
Are there toilets for them?
I've seen their faces.

42:36.070 --> 42:38.780
I can't be sure of this,
but one of them has a look like,

42:38.820 --> 42:40.700
"I should have taken
my chances back in Germany."

42:40.740 --> 42:41.910
-Oh...
-Papa.

42:41.950 --> 42:43.330
He's a pompous ass!
I said it.

42:43.370 --> 42:45.120
Did you hear that?
Is that the fridge?

42:45.160 --> 42:47.420
Oh, God, she's going
after the dessert.

42:47.460 --> 42:49.170
-(door shuts)
-Shirley!

42:49.210 --> 42:51.250
(Abe sighs)

42:56.050 --> 42:58.720
Are you really going
back to school?

42:58.760 --> 43:01.350
No.

43:01.390 --> 43:04.560
What are you gonna do?

43:04.600 --> 43:07.180
I don't know.

43:16.650 --> 43:18.320
What's this for?

43:18.360 --> 43:19.700
I don't know.

43:23.080 --> 43:25.660
(door opens, shuts)

43:28.660 --> 43:30.960
(inhales deeply)

43:35.420 --> 43:37.840
(sniffing)

43:40.840 --> 43:42.010
(Joel and Moishe arguing)

43:42.050 --> 43:43.800
JOEL:
Where we gonna go, huh?

43:43.850 --> 43:45.220
MOISHE: I don't care, the
street... what do I care?

43:45.260 --> 43:46.470
-Oh, God.
-JOEL: Aw, you're bluffing.

43:46.520 --> 43:48.020
MOISHE:
I'm not bluffing.

43:48.060 --> 43:49.060
This is not a bluff
you want to call.

43:49.100 --> 43:50.270
I'm doing nothing.

43:50.310 --> 43:51.600
This is all you, my boy.

43:51.650 --> 43:53.230
Are you crazy?
It was a wedding gift.

43:53.270 --> 43:54.520
What was a wedding gift?

43:54.570 --> 43:55.820
A wedding gift
to a married couple.

43:55.860 --> 43:57.070
A gift for you and Miriam.

43:57.110 --> 43:58.110
You say there's
no longer a couple?

43:58.150 --> 43:59.740
Fine, I'll take it back.

43:59.780 --> 44:01.110
The apartment is
in my name.

44:01.160 --> 44:02.530
I can do what I want with it.

44:02.570 --> 44:04.780
-He owns your apartment?
-Why would you do this?

44:04.830 --> 44:05.790
You say you want me
out of your life.

44:05.830 --> 44:07.120
Okay, I'm out of your life.

44:07.160 --> 44:08.450
But I'm taking
the apartment with me.

44:08.500 --> 44:09.580
You're a real
son of a bitch.

44:09.620 --> 44:10.660
Joel.
It-it's not true.

44:10.710 --> 44:12.080
Tell me it's not true.

44:12.120 --> 44:13.080
You going back to school,
Miriam?

44:13.130 --> 44:14.340
Take a business class.

44:14.380 --> 44:16.000
'Cause the boy here doesn't know

44:16.050 --> 44:18.050
-his ass from his elbows.
-Hey, hey, we have neighbors.

44:18.090 --> 44:19.630
He's fuckin' lousy with numbers.

44:19.670 --> 44:21.430
You guys are broke.
You're living hand to mouth.

44:21.470 --> 44:23.680
Joel buys you flowers,
they're from me.

44:23.720 --> 44:25.260
-Joel...
-You own nothing.

44:25.300 --> 44:28.220
Your apartment is mine,
his job is his uncle's, so mine.

44:28.270 --> 44:30.350
He's provided nothing,
he's saved nothing.

44:30.390 --> 44:32.100
Joel, please talk.

44:32.140 --> 44:35.360
You didn't tell her.
Your wife, she didn't know.

44:35.400 --> 44:38.230
-Toddlers, both of you.
-Okay, get out of my house.

44:38.280 --> 44:40.530
-Uh, you mean my house.
-I don't care whose house it is!

44:40.570 --> 44:41.650
Get out if it!

44:41.700 --> 44:42.820
Let's be clear
about it...

44:42.860 --> 44:44.990
(all shouting)

44:45.030 --> 44:47.870
Mosh, get out of here!
I said get out, both of you!

44:47.910 --> 44:50.450
Just stop...
Just take him out of here...

44:50.500 --> 44:53.040
-SHIRLEY: The happy family.
-Shirley...

44:53.080 --> 44:55.580
WOMAN:
Wichita.

44:55.630 --> 44:58.920
Wichita.

44:58.960 --> 45:01.010
Wichita!

45:01.050 --> 45:03.130
-Excuse me, Miss.
-Ha!

45:06.680 --> 45:11.480
Clothed in mendacity,
Wichita.

45:11.520 --> 45:12.890
Dripping...
What the... Come on.

45:12.940 --> 45:16.360
Ya zhivu v bolshom dome
Na kholm.

45:16.400 --> 45:18.400
That's Russian, motherfucker!

45:18.440 --> 45:20.650
(audience "oohs")

45:20.690 --> 45:22.070
And here we go.

45:22.110 --> 45:23.650
I was a Russian
literature major,

45:23.700 --> 45:25.110
and that line was from a book,

45:25.160 --> 45:26.700
or a poem...
I can't remember.

45:26.740 --> 45:28.080
All I can remember is

45:28.120 --> 45:31.540
Ya zhivu v bolshom dome
Na kholm,

45:31.580 --> 45:34.790
which means, "I live
in the large house on the hill."

45:34.830 --> 45:37.710
That's funny.

45:37.750 --> 45:39.590
That's really funny.

45:39.630 --> 45:42.380
And the reason it's so funny
is because

45:42.420 --> 45:45.180
I used to live
in the large house on the hill.

45:45.220 --> 45:47.970
And now I live nowhere.

45:48.010 --> 45:50.810
As of an hour ago,
my address changed to "huh?"

45:50.850 --> 45:52.770
-(laughter)
-See,

45:52.810 --> 45:55.100
my life completely
fell apart today,

45:55.140 --> 45:56.230
and here's why.

45:56.270 --> 46:01.400
My father-in-law
owns my house.

46:01.440 --> 46:06.410
And he took it back
when his son left me.

46:06.450 --> 46:08.410
(audience reacts mildly)

46:08.450 --> 46:10.160
Actually, that doesn't
sound funny at all.

46:10.200 --> 46:13.700
That sounds... awful.

46:13.750 --> 46:15.370
Biblical, right?

46:15.410 --> 46:18.880
Like, like it's Adam
and Eve time,

46:18.920 --> 46:22.510
and I marry Adam's son, Cain.

46:22.550 --> 46:24.970
We get a nice little place,
I think we're very happy,

46:25.010 --> 46:28.390
and then one day
Cain leaves me for,

46:28.430 --> 46:30.260
I don't know, his brother Abel,

46:30.300 --> 46:31.720
because there's only four
fuckin' people

46:31.760 --> 46:33.180
on the planet at this point.

46:33.220 --> 46:36.060
And then Adam...
Adam takes my house

46:36.100 --> 46:38.560
and tells me to do
jigsaw puzzles.

46:38.600 --> 46:40.480
(laughter)

46:41.980 --> 46:44.650
God, how did I not know
it wasn't our house?

46:44.690 --> 46:47.700
How stupid am I? I mean,
I never thought to ask,

46:47.740 --> 46:49.410
"Hey, in case you leave me
for your secretary,

46:49.450 --> 46:51.700
what's the situation
with our deed?"

46:51.740 --> 46:54.370
It's the bras, right?

46:54.410 --> 46:56.120
It's the bras.

46:56.160 --> 46:59.080
And the... the girdles
and the corsets,

46:59.120 --> 47:01.750
all designed to cut off
the circulation to your brain,

47:01.790 --> 47:04.380
so you walk around on the verge
of passing out,

47:04.420 --> 47:06.010
and you look at your husband,
and he tells you things,

47:06.050 --> 47:07.720
and you just believe them.

47:07.760 --> 47:09.760
Like, like when you're
a little girl,

47:09.800 --> 47:13.510
and people say, "The princess
lived in a magic castle

47:13.560 --> 47:14.890
"for a hundred years.

47:14.930 --> 47:17.100
"And then a prince
climbed up the side,

47:17.140 --> 47:19.900
"slayed a dragon,
kissed her, woke her up,

47:19.940 --> 47:22.770
and they lived happily
ever after."

47:22.820 --> 47:26.440
And you think...
that's plausible.

47:26.490 --> 47:27.490
(laughter)

47:27.530 --> 47:28.820
Couple of details are fuzzy,

47:28.860 --> 47:30.410
but sure,
I'll buy that.

47:30.450 --> 47:33.530
Later, you find out the prince's
father owns the castle,

47:33.580 --> 47:35.740
the prince's secretary
knows shorthand,

47:35.790 --> 47:37.620
and Sleeping Beauty's screwed.

47:37.660 --> 47:39.670
(laughter)

47:39.710 --> 47:41.130
You've heard about
the shorthand girls?

47:41.170 --> 47:44.210
These are girls
whose skill in life

47:44.250 --> 47:47.050
is not writing full sentences.

47:47.090 --> 47:50.380
Meanwhile, I went to college
to learn Russian.

47:50.430 --> 47:53.760
And speaking of vodka,
why don't they serve booze here?

47:53.800 --> 47:55.100
I need a drink.

47:55.140 --> 47:56.560
I need a stiff drink.

47:56.600 --> 47:58.770
I need a drink so stiff
I could blow it.

47:58.810 --> 48:00.520
-Sorry, that's un-ladylike.
-(laughter)

48:00.560 --> 48:02.980
You look offended.

48:03.020 --> 48:04.940
I don't mean to offend
the delicate.

48:04.980 --> 48:07.780
I-I used to be delicate.
I was delightful.

48:07.820 --> 48:11.360
I was a goddamn flower.
I smelled like roses,

48:11.410 --> 48:13.740
and sunshine shone
out of my ass.

48:13.780 --> 48:15.620
-(loud laughter)
-What?

48:15.660 --> 48:17.830
I said sunshine.

48:17.870 --> 48:21.370
Hey, when you get home,
check the name on your deed.

48:21.420 --> 48:22.580
Oh, you are kidding me.

48:22.630 --> 48:24.420
I know I must seem
a bit angry

48:24.460 --> 48:27.420
and deranged
to you all right now, and I am.

48:27.460 --> 48:30.630
I'll admit, I would like
to repeatedly kick

48:30.670 --> 48:32.760
every man in here in the balls

48:32.800 --> 48:34.140
over the course
of the next several hours.

48:34.180 --> 48:37.930
I won't, though.
I am still a lady.

48:37.970 --> 48:39.980
And a lady never kicks men
repeatedly in the balls

48:40.020 --> 48:41.520
for longer than 20,
30 minutes tops.

48:41.560 --> 48:44.560
Because then their girdles
start to draw blood.

48:44.610 --> 48:46.190
-(laughter)
-All right, all right.

48:46.230 --> 48:48.230
I told you about the language.
You know the drill.

48:48.280 --> 48:49.780
Officer Peluso...

48:49.820 --> 48:53.780
Ladies and gentlemen,
Officer Peluso!

48:55.530 --> 48:57.790
He arrested me
just the other night.

48:57.830 --> 49:00.000
Come down from there right now
or I'm coming up there.

49:00.040 --> 49:01.710
Officer, sorry, I work alone.

49:01.750 --> 49:03.870
Now, and apparently
for the rest of my life.

49:03.920 --> 49:06.210
I'm gonna count to five.
One... (count continues)

49:06.250 --> 49:08.670
That's the end of my show,
folks. Tune in next week,

49:08.710 --> 49:11.170
when my grandmother steals my
pearls and fucks my boyfriend.

49:11.220 --> 49:13.220
Five!
Let's go, Peluso.

49:13.260 --> 49:16.260
(cheering, whistling)

49:21.140 --> 49:23.440
That's my client.

49:26.440 --> 49:29.070
We charge for pictures now.

49:29.110 --> 49:31.860
(cheering, applause continue)
