WEBVTT

00:11.533 --> 00:12.534
- Stop!

00:12.577 --> 00:14.492
Tenors, I need more volume.

00:14.536 --> 00:15.972
I can't hear you over the sound

00:16.016 --> 00:19.802
of Franz Schubert thrashing
and wailing in his grave.

00:21.108 --> 00:25.851
Franz Schubert is the composer
of "Ave Maria."

00:25.895 --> 00:28.071
And he's angry.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.290
because you suck...

00:29.333 --> 00:30.247
- Oh.
- Oh, I get it!

00:30.291 --> 00:31.857
- Sick burn!

00:31.901 --> 00:34.164
- If my name was Franz,
I'd want to be dead, too.

00:34.208 --> 00:35.557
- Excuse me.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.211
I think we sound good.

00:37.254 --> 00:39.169
- Ha, "good"!

00:39.213 --> 00:42.346
The lonely chubby stepsister
of "great."

00:42.390 --> 00:43.956
If we're gonna qualify
for state,

00:44.000 --> 00:46.133
"good" is not gonna cut it.

00:46.176 --> 00:48.744
I'm calling an emergency
rehearsal for tomorrow.

00:48.787 --> 00:50.354
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Tomorrow?

00:50.398 --> 00:52.182
- No can do, Artie-poo.

00:52.226 --> 00:54.271
- Don't ever call me that.
Why not?

00:54.315 --> 00:56.273
- Because tomorrow is the first
day of deer-hunting season.

00:56.317 --> 00:59.015
- It's sort of a unofficialholiday in Kentucky.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.104
Everything shuts down,even the schools.

01:01.148 --> 01:02.497
- And this is the first year

01:02.540 --> 01:04.107
Cash is old enoughto come with me.

01:04.151 --> 01:08.938
It's a classic rite of passagewhere a boy becomes a man.

01:08.981 --> 01:12.115
Or as you may call it,a bar mitzvah.

01:12.159 --> 01:14.204
- I'm not Jewish.

01:14.248 --> 01:16.293
- Wait, bar mitzvah's
a Jewish thing?

01:17.599 --> 01:19.514
I always thought
it was a New York thing.

01:19.557 --> 01:22.343
- Normally I have a year
to prepare

01:22.386 --> 01:23.561
for a major competition.

01:23.605 --> 01:25.346
I will not be embarrassed.

01:25.389 --> 01:28.740
So you can kill your woodland
creatures after the Regionals.

01:28.784 --> 01:29.828
- No.

01:29.872 --> 01:31.787
- No?
- No.

01:31.830 --> 01:33.180
- Are you questioningmy authority?

01:33.223 --> 01:35.356
- I'm denying its existence.

01:35.399 --> 01:38.272
You have no leverage over me.

01:38.315 --> 01:39.403
I'm a volunteer,

01:39.447 --> 01:42.145
not some neurotic student who
signed up for freshman choir

01:42.189 --> 01:45.061
because I need
the approval of Angry Santa.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.411
- Angry Santa. That's you.

01:47.455 --> 01:48.195
- Where are you going?

01:48.238 --> 01:50.153
Rehearsal is not over
until I say it's over.

01:50.197 --> 01:51.981
- Oh, no!

01:52.024 --> 01:54.288
Dr. Cochran's mad at me.

01:54.331 --> 01:56.028
If I get kickedout of glee club,

01:56.072 --> 01:58.422
I might have timeto lose my virginity.

02:00.990 --> 02:03.645
- I think of you more
as an angry Wolf Blitzer.

02:06.561 --> 02:07.953
- Okay, rehearsal's over.

02:07.997 --> 02:08.998
- Awesome, thanks.

02:12.219 --> 02:15.178
- ♪ Hallelujah,
thine the glory ♪

02:15.222 --> 02:19.400
♪ Revive us again

02:20.488 --> 02:22.533
- Okay, this is gonna helpyour dyslexia.

02:22.577 --> 02:26.450
Just use your fingerand write a word in the sand.

02:26.494 --> 02:27.756
- Any word?

02:27.799 --> 02:30.672
- Nothing that startswith an F.

02:30.715 --> 02:31.542
Or an S.

02:31.586 --> 02:34.415
You know what?Just write "butt."

02:34.458 --> 02:35.981
- Do I have to do this, Mom?

02:36.025 --> 02:38.462
Dad says no one listens
to Angry Santa.

02:38.506 --> 02:39.898
- Cash!

02:39.942 --> 02:41.552
- It's not my fault Adams
hit Arthur with a sick burn.

02:41.596 --> 02:43.772
- It doesn't matterhow sick the burn was,

02:43.815 --> 02:46.253
Dr. Cochran is helping you,so you better do what he says.

02:46.296 --> 02:47.993
- This is how it starts.

02:48.037 --> 02:49.908
One singer disrespects you,it spreads through the choir.

02:49.952 --> 02:51.258
Next thing you know,

02:51.301 --> 02:52.824
you're taking flak froma booger-eating ten-year-old.

02:52.868 --> 02:55.784
- 11-year-old.
- Do your work.

02:55.827 --> 02:58.482
- Oh, uh, Ginny,I hate to be a bother,

02:58.526 --> 03:00.005
but I placed my order20 minutes ago,

03:00.049 --> 03:02.486
and I know it doesn't takethat long to warm milk.

03:02.530 --> 03:04.880
- Sorry, I'm just worried
about Arthur and Adams.

03:04.923 --> 03:06.316
- Oh, yes.

03:06.360 --> 03:07.404
That was quite a showdown.

03:07.448 --> 03:10.799
Like, Helen Hunt versusthe tornado in that film,

03:10.842 --> 03:13.845
"Don't Make God Angry,or He'll Throw a Cow at You."

03:13.889 --> 03:16.370
- I just--I can't afford
to have Adams run him off.

03:16.413 --> 03:18.589
Tutors cost 50 bucks
an hour,

03:18.633 --> 03:21.636
and I pay him
in day-old biscuits.

03:25.292 --> 03:27.729
- Is she the only waitress
working tonight?

03:27.772 --> 03:30.862
- Look at you, working hard!

03:30.906 --> 03:31.950
That's nice.

03:31.994 --> 03:33.430
Hey, you know what else
would be nice?

03:33.474 --> 03:35.606
You going easy on Arthur
so he doesn't quit.

03:35.650 --> 03:37.391
I don't know, just a thought.

03:37.434 --> 03:38.696
- Please.

03:38.740 --> 03:41.090
That man thinks he can
come into this town

03:41.133 --> 03:42.134
and push me around?

03:43.310 --> 03:44.398
I did not get the cover of

03:44.441 --> 03:46.269
"Bluegrass
Businesswoman Magazine"

03:46.313 --> 03:47.270
by being a pushover.

03:47.314 --> 03:48.924
- I thought it was
because you owned it.

03:48.967 --> 03:53.407
- I did. I also own this diner
and the bourbon distillery.

03:53.450 --> 03:54.408
- Yes, you are very
important---

03:54.451 --> 03:56.061
- Important?

03:59.935 --> 04:03.286
I am a pillar
of this community.

04:03.330 --> 04:05.636
But that egomaniac is too busy

04:05.680 --> 04:08.552
throwing his résumé in my face
to pay me my due respect.

04:08.596 --> 04:09.988
- You know what's funny?

04:10.032 --> 04:12.339
You two actually
have more in common than--

04:13.557 --> 04:16.125
You like respect, got it.

04:20.782 --> 04:24.438
Look at you, helping my son
overcome his challenges!

04:24.481 --> 04:25.439
That's nice!

04:25.482 --> 04:26.570
You know what else
would be nice?

04:26.614 --> 04:29.312
You showing Adams some respect.

04:29.356 --> 04:30.574
I don't know, just a thought.

04:31.488 --> 04:33.447
That was a snort.
Of derision.

04:33.490 --> 04:34.796
- I'm just saying,

04:34.839 --> 04:37.320
show some appreciation
for her accomplishments.

04:37.364 --> 04:38.713
Ooh, I know!

04:38.756 --> 04:40.192
Get her to sign a cover

04:40.236 --> 04:42.325
of "Bluegrass Businesswoman
Magazine" for ya!

04:42.369 --> 04:45.415
- Adams is like the toughest
guy in the prison yard.

04:45.459 --> 04:47.461
You don't go up to that guy
and ask him for an autograph.

04:47.504 --> 04:49.332
You punch him in the face.

04:49.376 --> 04:50.420
- With a...

04:50.464 --> 04:51.682
fist full of respect?

04:51.726 --> 04:53.902
- You know, when I was
teaching at Princeton--

04:53.945 --> 04:56.034
- Mm, I was wondering when
you were gonna work that in.

04:56.078 --> 04:59.690
- I had a problem with
the president of Princeton.

04:59.734 --> 05:01.910
- Mm.
- The Princeton president.

05:01.953 --> 05:03.564
- I'm sorry, where?
- Princeton, New Jersey.

05:03.607 --> 05:04.478
- I can't hear you.

05:04.521 --> 05:05.914
- Princeton?
- I never heard of it.

05:05.957 --> 05:07.481
- Anyway, I invited himon a quail hunt.

05:07.524 --> 05:09.352
I totally outshot him,

05:09.396 --> 05:11.267
and I never had a problem
with him again,

05:11.311 --> 05:13.748
and that is exactly what I'm
gonna do with Adams tomorrow.

05:13.791 --> 05:16.011
- You know, it's one thingto shoot birds with some nerd,

05:16.054 --> 05:18.622
but Adams was on the cover of"Kentucky Huntress" magazine,

05:18.666 --> 05:19.580
and she doesn't own that one!

05:20.624 --> 05:22.147
This is gonna be a disaster.

05:22.191 --> 05:24.149
- I--

05:24.193 --> 05:25.412
Who do I need
to bless around here

05:25.455 --> 05:27.370
to get a glass of warm milk?

- Whoo-whee!

06:34.611 --> 06:36.570
We are gonna pee outside

06:36.613 --> 06:40.574
and scratch ourselves and burp
and fart wherever we want.

06:40.617 --> 06:42.010
- You're a lucky woman, Ginny.

06:42.053 --> 06:43.794
- Oh, actually,we're getting divorced.

06:43.838 --> 06:45.666
That's what I meant.

06:45.709 --> 06:49.017
- Hey, son, do you realize that
you are the seventh generation

06:49.060 --> 06:51.672
of Hawlings men
to hunt in these woods?

06:51.715 --> 06:52.716
Check this out.

06:52.760 --> 06:53.717
That's me when I was your age

06:53.761 --> 06:56.590
with my daddy
and my first kill.

06:56.633 --> 06:59.114
- Did you get many likes?

06:59.157 --> 07:01.682
How did you get this pictureoff your phone

07:01.725 --> 07:04.075
and on this raggedy pieceof paper?

07:04.119 --> 07:05.076
- Magic, son.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.121
Magic.

07:06.164 --> 07:07.731
- Sorry I'm late.

07:07.775 --> 07:10.125
- Oh, looking snazzy, Arthur,

07:10.168 --> 07:12.257
like a distinguished
Elmer Fudd.

07:12.301 --> 07:14.259
- What is he doing here?
- I'm going hunting with you.

07:14.303 --> 07:15.478
She didn't tell you
I was coming?

07:15.522 --> 07:17.480
- You didn't tell mehe was coming.

07:17.524 --> 07:18.742
- Surprise.

07:18.786 --> 07:20.701
Isn't it great?
It's gonna be great.

07:20.744 --> 07:22.703
You guys get to spend
some time together

07:22.746 --> 07:23.878
and get to know
each other better,

07:23.921 --> 07:25.706
and, plus, I hear Arthur's
a really good hunter.

07:25.749 --> 07:28.404
- No, I am an excellent hunter.

07:28.448 --> 07:31.494
- Put the gun down, jackass.
It's bow-hunting season.

07:31.538 --> 07:34.323
And don't you dare
get in my way.

07:34.366 --> 07:38.501
That's how people get hurt,
accidentally or otherwise.

07:41.983 --> 07:44.507
- It's gonna be great!

07:47.336 --> 07:49.077
- Rememberwhat I told you, son.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.644
It's just like that game"Big Buck Hunter,"

07:50.687 --> 07:53.124
except now you got a bowand there's better graphics,

07:53.168 --> 07:55.736
and we're bondingin the woods...

07:55.779 --> 07:57.651
instead of a bar.

07:57.694 --> 07:59.696
- Cool dog.What's his name?

07:59.740 --> 08:01.306
- Name's Boone.

08:01.350 --> 08:03.874
He's gonna help me find
a special kind of mushroom

08:03.918 --> 08:06.616
that grows underground
called a truffle.

08:06.660 --> 08:09.314
- Wait, you're not hunting deerlike us?

08:09.358 --> 08:11.665
- No, no, I don't believe
in killing any living creature,

08:11.708 --> 08:12.883
especially something

08:12.927 --> 08:15.103
as beautiful and majestic
as a deer.

08:16.626 --> 08:18.933
- Oh, uh, but I do believe

08:18.976 --> 08:21.544
in spending time
in the beautiful Kentucky woods

08:21.588 --> 08:22.893
with my best friend.

08:22.937 --> 08:25.635
- Yep, there's no one elseI'd rather be out here with.

08:25.679 --> 08:27.028
Except for Dale Earnhardt Jr.

08:27.071 --> 08:29.726
I think that dude would besuch a cool hang.

08:29.770 --> 08:31.380
- Ooh.

08:31.423 --> 08:34.383
- Now, you sure you know
how to use one of these?

08:34.426 --> 08:36.864
- Yeah, how hard can it be?

08:41.651 --> 08:42.826
Right, right, right, right.Got it.

08:42.870 --> 08:45.133
- I liked his way better.

08:45.176 --> 08:47.918
- You know, Adams is
a really great hunter.

08:47.962 --> 08:49.920
Maybe she could give you
a few pointers.

08:49.964 --> 08:51.400
- Does he strike youas the type of man

08:51.443 --> 08:53.141
that likes to have a womanexplain things to him?

08:53.184 --> 08:55.622
- I don't mind, if the woman
has the proper credentials.

08:55.665 --> 08:57.928
- You want credentials?

08:57.972 --> 09:00.714
I was Miss Pulaski County,19...

09:00.757 --> 09:04.152
And my talent was hittingten bull's-eyes in a row

09:04.195 --> 09:06.458

09:45.236 --> 09:47.499
- Well, I got my truffle shovelright here.

09:47.543 --> 09:49.284
- Hey, Cash, hey!

09:49.327 --> 09:50.851
Stop messing around.

09:50.894 --> 09:52.896
Deer hunting
is serious business.

09:52.940 --> 09:53.984
Step one--

09:54.028 --> 09:56.900
we mask our scent
with deer urine.

09:56.944 --> 09:59.990
The trick is to spray it
into the air...

10:00.034 --> 10:01.644
and just walk
through the cloud.

10:03.690 --> 10:05.430
Yeah, that's nature's cologne.

10:11.393 --> 10:13.221
- So here's a fun one.

10:13.264 --> 10:16.485
What is your least favoritealbum from your favorite band?

10:16.528 --> 10:17.660
- Shh, shh, shh.

10:17.704 --> 10:18.879
You'll scare off the deer.

10:18.922 --> 10:20.707
- It's not sound that
scares them off, it's scent.

10:20.750 --> 10:24.362
- Mine is "Dig In Deep"by Miss Bonnie Raitt.

10:24.406 --> 10:26.234
- Let's hope
they don't catch a whiff

10:26.277 --> 10:28.976
of your overpowering
male arrogance.

10:30.847 --> 10:33.458
- Stand down, Cochran.

10:33.502 --> 10:34.808
This one's mine.

10:39.726 --> 10:42.598
♪ Oh, beautiful

10:42.642 --> 10:45.557
♪ For spacious skies

10:45.601 --> 10:48.691
♪ Sky--sky--sky--sky

10:48.735 --> 10:49.692
Oh!

10:49.736 --> 10:51.694
Damn it!

10:51.738 --> 10:53.783
You got in my head.
- Well, obviously not.

10:53.827 --> 10:54.741
If I was in your head,

10:54.784 --> 10:57.352
you would've known
how to hit that C-sharp.

11:11.845 --> 11:14.369
- Yeah, boy.
What a beaut.

11:14.412 --> 11:16.501
All right, son.

11:16.545 --> 11:17.807
This is your moment.

11:17.851 --> 11:19.374
Pull it back and let it rip.

11:19.417 --> 11:21.419
Or as our neighbor
Big Pat says

11:21.463 --> 11:23.900
about our Christmas lights
in April...

11:23.944 --> 11:25.815
take 'er down.

11:28.339 --> 11:29.384
- I can't do it.

11:29.427 --> 11:31.560
- Huh?

11:31.603 --> 11:32.648
What?

11:32.692 --> 11:33.736
Why not?

11:33.780 --> 11:34.911
- Like Uncle Dwayne said,

11:34.955 --> 11:37.305
why would you kill
a beautiful animal?

11:37.348 --> 11:39.873
- Because the ugly ones
don't taste as good.

11:39.916 --> 11:41.788
- But it's not fun
to hurt a living creature.

11:41.831 --> 11:43.615
And Uncle Dwayne said
the only thing a truffle hurts

11:43.659 --> 11:46.096
is your wallet when you're
trying to impress a date.

11:46.140 --> 11:47.924
- I did say that.

11:47.968 --> 11:48.969
That's a fun one.

11:49.012 --> 11:50.753
- What the hell, man?

11:50.797 --> 11:53.016
- I merely explained

11:53.060 --> 11:54.757
the benefits of gatheringversus hunting.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.803
- There's three things
every man should know--

11:56.846 --> 11:58.979
how to hunt,
how to make a fire,

11:59.022 --> 12:00.458
and how to pretend
he didn't notice

12:00.502 --> 12:02.330
a Whitney Houston song
just came on.

12:02.373 --> 12:04.898
You think a boy like Cash
is ready to process

12:04.941 --> 12:06.551
"I Will Always Love You"?

12:06.595 --> 12:07.814
- Just living my truth.

12:07.857 --> 12:09.467
But I'm sorryif that interferes

12:09.511 --> 12:10.991
with what you're tryingto teach your boy.

12:11.034 --> 12:13.863
- You're setting
a bad example for Cash.

12:13.907 --> 12:15.778
Cash? Cash?

12:15.822 --> 12:16.823
Hey!

12:16.866 --> 12:18.999
Cash!

12:21.044 --> 12:23.003
I know I say this a lot, but...

12:23.046 --> 12:24.744
Ginny's not gonna like this.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.357
- First the choir, now hunting?

12:29.400 --> 12:32.186
Congratulations, you've ruinedtwo things I love.

12:32.229 --> 12:34.144
- Come on, give me a third.
I'll go for the hat trick.

12:34.188 --> 12:36.973
- Okay, I'm sensing
a lot of mutual...

12:37.017 --> 12:38.801
respect here.

12:38.845 --> 12:41.064
- I'm gonna goretrieve my arrow.

12:41.108 --> 12:43.284
And when I get back,I want you gone!

12:43.327 --> 12:44.894
You can't make me go!

12:44.938 --> 12:46.069
You don't own the woods.

12:46.113 --> 12:46.940
- Uh...

12:46.983 --> 12:49.029
just everythingthe light touches

12:49.072 --> 12:50.508
and the mineral rightsbelow it.

12:50.552 --> 12:52.946
Yeah, I own the woods.

12:59.909 --> 13:03.260
- Oh, look,
a Yankee piñata.

13:03.304 --> 13:06.220
- And it's filledwith crushed nuts.

13:10.920 --> 13:14.184
- You know, on the way homewe could swing by Arthur's.

13:14.228 --> 13:16.099
It's never too lateto mend fences.

13:16.143 --> 13:18.319
- I am not apologizing.

13:18.362 --> 13:20.408
That man ruined my streak.

13:20.451 --> 13:23.715
I have bagged a buck
on opening day every year

13:23.759 --> 13:26.196
since 19...

13:26.240 --> 13:27.197
- Wait.

13:27.241 --> 13:28.895
What's Arthur's carstill doing here?

13:28.938 --> 13:30.418
He left an hour ago.

13:30.461 --> 13:31.723
- Damn it.

13:31.767 --> 13:34.509
That big-city bastard
went and got himself lost.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.512
- Arthur!

13:39.166 --> 13:40.080
Arthur.

13:40.123 --> 13:41.995
- Arthur!
- Arthur?

13:42.038 --> 13:43.213
- Don't shoot!

13:43.257 --> 13:44.911
I'm not a deer.
I'm a choral conductor.

13:44.954 --> 13:47.130
I'm just a little lost.

13:47.174 --> 13:49.959
But I-I have friends nearby.

13:50.003 --> 13:51.352
- Over here.

13:51.395 --> 13:52.744
- Thank God!

13:52.788 --> 13:56.009
I was unceremoniously dismissed
from the deer stand.

13:56.052 --> 13:57.662
I'm trying to get back
to the cars.

13:57.706 --> 14:00.056
You know where they are?
- I have no idea.

14:00.100 --> 14:01.710
- You're lost, too?

14:01.753 --> 14:02.798
- Well, Reverend Jax says

14:02.842 --> 14:05.279
you're never lostif you have God in your heart.

14:05.322 --> 14:07.803
- So we're lost.
- Yeah.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.023
- Cash!
- Cash, hey!

14:10.066 --> 14:12.939
Where are you, son?
Come on, buddy!

14:12.982 --> 14:14.984
Cash!

14:15.028 --> 14:17.073
Damn it!

14:17.117 --> 14:18.945
You ruined my first
hunting trip with my son.

14:18.988 --> 14:20.685
I'm his dad.

14:20.729 --> 14:23.166
I'm supposed to be the one
teaching him how to be a man!

14:23.210 --> 14:25.734
- But there are many waysto express your masculinity.

14:25.777 --> 14:27.518
- Like my fist in your face.

14:27.562 --> 14:28.780
Let's go.

14:28.824 --> 14:30.957
Come on.
Huh?

14:31.000 --> 14:32.567
Playground rules--

14:32.610 --> 14:35.700
no pantsing, no wedgies,
no purple nurples.

14:35.744 --> 14:36.919
All right?

14:36.963 --> 14:38.747
Now get on your knees
so it's a fair fight.

14:38.790 --> 14:39.922
Come on!

14:41.576 --> 14:43.621
- Can we stop?
I'm tired.

14:43.665 --> 14:46.407
- Uh, why not?

14:46.450 --> 14:48.061
By the way,
how did you get lost?

14:48.104 --> 14:49.976
I thought you were
with your dad.

14:50.019 --> 14:51.281
- I was, but I left

14:51.325 --> 14:52.979
when Uncle Dwayne and himgot in a fight.

14:53.022 --> 14:55.982
I can guess who won that one.

14:56.025 --> 14:58.375
I also got in a fight today
with Adams.

14:58.419 --> 15:01.074
- I can guess who won that one.
- Actually, she did.

15:01.117 --> 15:03.206
- Yeah.That was my guess.

15:03.250 --> 15:04.860
- What?
She's tough.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.123
I've never had a singer
I couldn't get to fall in line.

15:07.167 --> 15:09.212
- Do you want me to put ina good word for you?

15:09.256 --> 15:10.866
These dimples buya lot of goodwill.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.563
- Nah.

15:14.783 --> 15:15.740
Maybe.

15:15.784 --> 15:17.742
- Arthur!

15:17.786 --> 15:19.179
Arthur!

15:19.222 --> 15:20.963
We got to find him.
- Do we?

15:21.007 --> 15:22.660
A night in the woods
changes a man,

15:22.704 --> 15:25.359
and God knows
he can't get any worse.

15:25.402 --> 15:26.882
- Okay.

15:26.926 --> 15:30.103
Now, I say this with loveand a little bit of fear,

15:30.146 --> 15:32.757
but the way you've beenacting lately,

15:32.801 --> 15:35.369
you should be on the coverof "Bluegrass Bitch" magazine!

15:37.023 --> 15:38.894
- Excuse you?

15:38.938 --> 15:41.810
And excuse me
for trying to protect you

15:41.853 --> 15:44.595
from a disrespectful blowhard
who only cares about himself.

15:44.639 --> 15:47.033
- Now, that's not true.He's real good with Cash.

15:47.076 --> 15:48.425
- Of course he is!

15:48.469 --> 15:51.211
Only a monster could resist
those dimples.

15:51.254 --> 15:52.560
- Well...

15:52.603 --> 15:54.257
- And I know you were
taking a shot at me,

15:54.301 --> 15:55.476
but I think there could be

15:55.519 --> 15:58.914
a real market
for "Bluegrass Bitch."

15:58.958 --> 16:00.394
Merchandise.

16:00.437 --> 16:02.570
Ball caps, theme song.

16:02.613 --> 16:03.832
- Arthur!

16:03.875 --> 16:05.051
- Come on, man.

16:05.094 --> 16:06.574
You're not mad at me.

16:06.617 --> 16:10.099
You mad at that prisonthat is toxic masculinity.

16:10.143 --> 16:11.144
Shut up!

16:11.187 --> 16:14.669
Your gentle-giant mumbo-jumbo
is no match

16:14.712 --> 16:16.584
for my crazed
adrenaline strength.

16:19.848 --> 16:21.284
What was that?

16:21.328 --> 16:23.025
- I took an online course
in aikido,

16:23.069 --> 16:25.680
the Japanese art
of self-defense.

16:25.723 --> 16:28.422
I learned how to blend
with your attack...

16:29.858 --> 16:32.730
- And contain
your macho energy.

16:34.515 --> 16:36.256
- Feels good, doesn't it?
- No!

16:36.299 --> 16:37.518
- They say for happiness,

16:37.561 --> 16:40.129
a person needs
about 12 hugs a day, mm-hmm.

16:40.173 --> 16:41.435
- Really?

16:41.478 --> 16:44.046
No! I will not give in toyour strong, reassuring warmth.

16:49.225 --> 16:50.270
- There it is.

16:50.313 --> 16:52.185
- Man...

16:52.228 --> 16:54.274
I just wantedthis trip to go well.

16:55.884 --> 16:57.407
I already...

16:57.451 --> 16:59.322
failed Ginny as a husband.

16:59.366 --> 17:01.933
I can't fail Cash, too.

17:01.977 --> 17:05.154
- You know, I don't have kids
of my own, but...

17:05.198 --> 17:06.677
I know that being great dad

17:06.721 --> 17:10.333
means allowing your children
to follow their own path.

17:10.377 --> 17:13.162
You know
who I learned that from?

17:13.206 --> 17:14.555
- Mr. Rogers?

17:16.252 --> 17:18.341
- You.
- Yeah?

17:18.385 --> 17:20.343
- You know,
my dad never got me.

17:20.387 --> 17:22.432
Always picked on me
because I wouldn't hunt,

17:22.476 --> 17:25.305
play football, or fight.

17:25.348 --> 17:28.221
You were the only person
who accepted me.

17:30.310 --> 17:32.268
And I know you can
do the same for Cash.

17:41.147 --> 17:42.974
- Thanks, man.

17:43.018 --> 17:45.238
- Anytime, buddy.

17:45.281 --> 17:46.239
- Guys?

17:46.282 --> 17:48.937
What's going on?

17:48.980 --> 17:50.895
- Progress, Ginny.

17:50.939 --> 17:52.332
Progress.

17:52.375 --> 17:54.116
- Where's Cash?

17:54.160 --> 17:56.684
- Oh, yeah, uh, well,we kind of lost him,

17:56.727 --> 18:00.122
but, uh, we searched all over--
- You lost Cash?

18:00.166 --> 18:01.906
What the crap, Wayne?

18:01.950 --> 18:02.951
Cash!

18:02.994 --> 18:04.126
- Cash!
- Cash!

18:04.170 --> 18:05.345
- Cash!

18:05.388 --> 18:07.347
- Yep, I told you she
wasn't going to like that.

18:07.390 --> 18:08.304
- Yeah, at leastit'll be easier

18:08.348 --> 18:10.176
than that timeyou lost him in a corn maze.

18:10.219 --> 18:13.048
- Yeah, that was a long
Labor Day weekend.

18:13.092 --> 18:16.486
- Maybe this is a signI should move back to New York.

18:16.530 --> 18:18.009
At least there,somebody would've found us

18:18.053 --> 18:19.402
and mugged us by now.

18:19.446 --> 18:21.361
Hey, Huckleberry Finn.

18:21.404 --> 18:22.753
Careful whereyou're poking your stick.

18:22.797 --> 18:24.407
There might be somethingliving in there.

18:24.451 --> 18:26.453
- Yeah, like a truffle!

18:28.194 --> 18:31.284
Uh, truffles don't move,
do they?

18:31.327 --> 18:33.242
- Cash, get back!
It might be a snake!

18:33.286 --> 18:34.722
Oh.

18:34.765 --> 18:35.723
Oh.

18:35.766 --> 18:38.160
- Cash!
- Come on out, buddy!

18:38.204 --> 18:39.553
- Cash!
- Cash!

18:39.596 --> 18:42.382
- Cash!
- Cash!

18:47.822 --> 18:49.345
- Oh, my God, Cash!

18:49.389 --> 18:51.304
Honey, are you okay?

18:51.347 --> 18:53.001
- Yeah, we heard a scream.

18:53.044 --> 18:54.045
- That wasn't me.

18:56.700 --> 18:58.441
- Yeah,
look who's the soprano now.

18:58.485 --> 19:00.400
- It's called a head voice.

19:00.443 --> 19:02.358
- I was poking my stick
at an animal,

19:02.402 --> 19:05.840
and it got mad,
but Arthur protected me.

19:05.883 --> 19:06.623
- What kind of an--

19:06.667 --> 19:08.190
Oh, good Lord, that's a skunk.

19:08.234 --> 19:09.409
Ooh, let's get

19:09.452 --> 19:11.193
the H-E-double-hockey-sticksout of here.

19:11.237 --> 19:13.239
- It got me in the--
in the eyes.

19:13.282 --> 19:14.762
- It's not as bad as it seems.

19:14.805 --> 19:18.809
it's just an oily compound theyspray from their anal glands.

19:18.853 --> 19:20.463
- Which--what?

19:25.294 --> 19:27.296
- Oh, how's that stew coming?

19:27.340 --> 19:29.429
I'm sorry no onekilled a deer today.

19:29.472 --> 19:30.343
Actually, I love deer,

19:30.386 --> 19:31.866
and I don't wishto see them harmed,

19:31.909 --> 19:33.259
so in the words ofthe great Demi Lovato,

19:33.302 --> 19:35.435
"Sorry, not sorry."

19:35.478 --> 19:37.698
- The men are back
from hunting...

19:37.741 --> 19:39.265
- Ooh.
- And we bring you...

19:39.308 --> 19:40.788
both:
Mushrooms!

19:40.831 --> 19:42.572
- Which aren't as fancy
as truffles,

19:42.616 --> 19:44.095
but they're easier to find.

19:44.139 --> 19:47.229
- I am so proud of you, baby!
- That boy's a natural.

19:47.273 --> 19:48.622
- Hey, Ginny, get a picture.

19:48.665 --> 19:50.580
I want to commemorate
our first hunt together.

19:50.624 --> 19:52.582
- Oh, first of many, I bet.

19:52.626 --> 19:55.368
- Say "truffles."
both: Truffles!

19:55.411 --> 19:57.021
- All right, Dwayne.

19:57.065 --> 19:59.328
Clean 'em up, and let's
throw 'em in that stew.

19:59.372 --> 20:01.025
- Uh, okay.

20:01.069 --> 20:02.462
Edible...

20:02.505 --> 20:04.464
poisonous...

20:04.507 --> 20:07.249
extremely hallucinogenic.

20:09.077 --> 20:10.513
Okay...

20:12.907 --> 20:15.475
- You know, I've performed
baptisms in that tub,

20:15.518 --> 20:17.477
and tomato juice
is mostly water,

20:17.520 --> 20:18.478
so if you wanted to convert--

20:18.521 --> 20:19.870
- Get away from me.

20:19.914 --> 20:22.133
- Not the right time.
I completely understand.

20:24.179 --> 20:25.746
- Are you here to gloat?

20:25.789 --> 20:28.531
- No, I'm bringing
a peace offering.

20:28.575 --> 20:31.099
Vodka to go
with your tomato juice.

20:31.142 --> 20:32.970
I call it a "Bloody Arthur."

20:33.014 --> 20:34.145
- Feels like gloating.

20:34.189 --> 20:36.496
- I still think
you're arrogant and rude,

20:36.539 --> 20:37.627
unnecessarily pretentious,

20:37.671 --> 20:40.282
couldn't hit a deer
with your car.

20:40.326 --> 20:41.979
- I'm waiting for a "but."

20:42.023 --> 20:44.155
- You're always
interrupting people.

20:44.199 --> 20:45.635
However...

20:45.679 --> 20:47.855
you're good for Cash,
and who knows?

20:47.898 --> 20:50.118
Maybe you'll be good
for the rest of us, too.

20:50.161 --> 20:51.902
So, from now on,

20:51.946 --> 20:54.427
I will allow you
to lead the choir.

20:54.470 --> 20:57.517
- Because I amthe choir leader?

20:57.560 --> 20:59.606
- Because I allowed it.

21:01.172 --> 21:03.000
- Deal.

21:03.044 --> 21:04.088
- The vittles are ready!

21:04.132 --> 21:06.569
"Vittles" is
a Southern word for "food."

21:06.613 --> 21:08.354
- Yeah, I've seen"The Beverly Hillbillies."

21:08.397 --> 21:09.659
- Or as my missionary parents
called it,

21:09.703 --> 21:10.878
"You Think They're Rich,

21:10.921 --> 21:12.358
You Should See
The Mansions In Heaven."

21:15.012 --> 21:16.187
- Needs olives.

21:16.231 --> 21:18.451
- I see a couple of
little olives right there.

21:25.022 --> 21:26.285
- You wish.
