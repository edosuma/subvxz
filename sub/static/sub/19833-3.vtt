a warrior, from Guthred of Eofervvic.

16:23.442 --> 16:25.236
RAGNAR: You sold him as a slave.

16:25.361 --> 16:28.322
I see the faces of so many creatures.

You will not feed the slaves!

16:40.710 --> 16:43.254
And you will not bark
like a great fat hound!

16:49.719 --> 16:51.429

16:51.554 --> 16:53.181
Yes, I did.

There was another man, smaller, Saxon.

17:11.656 --> 17:13.284
(SIGHS)

17:13.409 --> 17:16.369
A sea trader named Sverri
took them both.

Where is Sverri now?

17:17.747 --> 17:20.708
JONIS: Wherever the sea
and promise of silver takes him.

17:20.833 --> 17:23.127
Life at the oar is hard and short.

17:23.252 --> 17:26.339
Sverri will return, I'm sure.

17:29.592 --> 17:33.721
Autumn and winter will pass,
but come spring,

17:38.142 --> 17:40.645
we will gather for business
at the beach.

17:41.812 --> 17:44.774
Sverri will be there, I swear.

17:46.734 --> 17:49.237
And between that time he sails where?

17:50.071 --> 17:54.575

the roughest sea, he could be any place.

- I tell you what I know to be true.

19:25.833 --> 19:27.209
I did.

I've ever given you.

he is not here as a suitor.

He is barely alive.

20:35.528 --> 20:37.029
Lord Ceolwulf,

20:38.364 --> 20:41.700
Wessex is honored to welcome you.

20:41.826 --> 20:44.203
We welcome all of the Ealdormen
of Mercia.

20:44.286 --> 20:45.538
We do not.

20:45.663 --> 20:47.456
May our discussions
prove to be beneficial

20:47.581 --> 20:49.083
and fruitful for both parties.

20:49.208 --> 20:51.043
Swords, Alfred.

20:52.211 --> 20:55.047
I shall make my point clear
from the outset.

20:56.257 --> 21:00.761
We demand swords
and the men to carry them.

21:01.637 --> 21:05.641
To help stem the wave upon wave
of raiders, lord, from the Daneland.

21:05.766 --> 21:07.226
Forgive my interruption.

21:07.309 --> 21:12.648
Mercia lost many a warrior at Ethandun,
and willingly.

21:14.733 --> 21:17.611
I expect repayment.

21:17.736 --> 21:19.780
I hear you, Ceolwulf.

21:19.905 --> 21:22.491
I consider our lands to be one...

21:22.616 --> 21:24.702
CEOLWULF: No, we are not one,

21:24.827 --> 21:29.081
we are Mercia and you are Wessex.

21:32.251 --> 21:34.170
Refreshment?

21:34.295 --> 21:36.005
CEOLWULF: Swords.

21:37.256 --> 21:39.091
I will not be silenced.

21:39.258 --> 21:42.970
Lord Ceolwulf, perhaps a seat?
It has been a long journey.

21:43.679 --> 21:45.431
It has.

21:47.266 --> 21:49.101
For a purpose.

21:50.394 --> 21:52.313
ALFRED: I understand completely

21:52.438 --> 21:56.817
that at times the East of Mercia
is overrun with Viking raiders.

21:56.984 --> 21:59.320
We suffer the same fate
along our northern border.

21:59.445 --> 22:02.656
What of your warrior Uhtred?

22:03.908 --> 22:09.371
He is a leader of men. Dispatch him
to our border with Daneland.

22:09.497 --> 22:13.584
Uhtred and 50 men I will accept.

22:15.753 --> 22:20.466
Uhtred was last seen in Northumbria,
lord, the place of his birth.

22:20.591 --> 22:22.009
CEOLWULF: Northumbria?

22:23.302 --> 22:27.932
You can send men to the far north
but not to your neighbor?

22:29.433 --> 22:33.646
Lord Ceolwulf,
the solution to our problem,

22:33.771 --> 22:35.481
I feel, is a bond.

22:35.606 --> 22:39.944
The solution is swords and men.

22:40.069 --> 22:42.738
A pennanent bond
between Wessex and Mercia.

22:42.863 --> 22:45.699
- ODDA: A union, lord.
- CEOLWULF: Swords!

22:45.824 --> 22:49.203
How many times do I need to say it?!
(ECHOING THUD)

22:49.328 --> 22:52.373
CEOLWULF: How many times
am I to be ignored?

22:52.498 --> 22:54.959
Lord Ceolwulf, you have read my letters?

22:57.086 --> 22:58.170
Lord Ceolwulf?

22:58.337 --> 23:01.173
Yes, of course I have read your letters.

23:03.717 --> 23:05.636
You're looking for a buck.

23:05.761 --> 23:07.638
AELSWITH: A match, lord.

23:07.763 --> 23:10.349
And I have a name for you right here.

23:12.184 --> 23:14.144
In a letter of my own.

23:14.270 --> 23:16.355

23:16.480 --> 23:21.819

23:23.404 --> 23:25.656
But what guarantee do I have

23:26.490 --> 23:31.829
that Mercia will not become
a mere appendage of Wessex,

23:32.580 --> 23:34.206
a poor cousin?

23:35.082 --> 23:38.168
- We are a kingdom.
- Lord, your first concern should be

23:38.294 --> 23:40.629
that you do not become an appendage
to Daneland.

23:40.754 --> 23:47.511
And who was it
agreed to this thing called Daneland?!

23:47.636 --> 23:49.430
It was you.

23:50.389 --> 23:51.974
It was Alfred!

23:53.684 --> 23:58.606
And now it is Mercia that suffers most.

23:58.731 --> 24:00.816
- Swords you demand, lord.
- CEOLWULF: I do.

24:00.941 --> 24:02.610
- And swords you shall have.
- How many?

24:02.735 --> 24:05.029
ALFRED: Wessex could never turn away
from Mercia.

24:05.154 --> 24:09.241
It would be akin to Alfred turning away
from Aelswith.

24:09.950 --> 24:13.203
It could never occur,
Lord Ceolwulf, never.

24:13.329 --> 24:15.205
CEOLWULF: What is this?

24:15.331 --> 24:23.297

and yet you insist on speaking of unions

24:25.341 --> 24:27.134

the first reluctant bride.

It is also a truth that she was

- He is a man of God!

56:00.484 --> 56:03.987
Say it one more time, priest,
and I swear the devil will take you.

56:04.112 --> 56:06.907
You're nothing but a heathen
and the bitch is married!

56:07.533 --> 56:08.825
- (YELLS)
- (GASPS)

56:12.204 --> 56:13.413
(LOUD mun)

56:28.971 --> 56:30.264
YOU!

56:34.184 --> 56:36.019
You will go to my uncle,

56:37.187 --> 56:39.022
and when he asks of his wife,

56:40.232 --> 56:43.277
you will tell him she's in the bed
of Uhtred of Bebbanburg.

57:06.675 --> 57:09.469
I trust you are in health.

57:09.595 --> 57:11.972
I improve with each passing day.

57:14.308 --> 57:16.602
- UHTRED: And you, lord?
- God afflicts me.

57:16.727 --> 57:20.564
But there is purpose in that,
so I must be glad of it.

57:23.066 --> 57:25.485
Earl Ragnar, he is a good man.

57:26.570 --> 57:29.197
I should like to free both him
and Brida.

57:31.533 --> 57:33.076
Thank you, lord,

57:33.201 --> 57:36.038
- for all you have done.
- What do you think of my candles?

57:39.583 --> 57:41.501
I find them to be more effective
at night.

57:45.255 --> 57:47.424
I have missed your childish insolence.

57:49.509 --> 57:51.553
ALFRED: I'm trying to measure
the passing of time.

57:51.678 --> 57:56.600
I'm hoping to find a candle that burns
from midday to midday.

57:59.269 --> 58:01.563
UHTRED:
Lord, why did you have me rescued?

58:01.688 --> 58:03.899
- Why have you brought me here?
- ALFRED: I had you rescued

58:04.024 --> 58:07.027
firstly because I was able and secondly
because it is no more than you deserved.

58:09.696 --> 58:13.533
Though I admit, I...
would like you in my service once again.

58:18.955 --> 58:21.208
I am grateful, of course,

58:23.919 --> 58:25.921
but I have my own path to follow.

58:26.046 --> 58:27.923
- Destiny.
- Destiny, lord.

58:30.676 --> 58:32.260
You killed the Abbot Eadred.

58:34.888 --> 58:38.642
According to the words of Brother Trew
and others.

58:38.767 --> 58:41.019
- He was a weasel, lord.
- A weasel without a sword,

58:41.144 --> 58:43.021
- a holy weasel.
- Who deserved to die.

58:43.146 --> 58:46.358
You killed him on blessed ground.
He was an abbot.

58:48.402 --> 58:50.779
However, you were
in the company of Earl Ragnar,

58:50.904 --> 58:53.323
in the charge of Earl Ragnar,
who was under my orders

58:53.490 --> 58:56.076
and whom I hold responsible
for the killing of Abbot Eadred.

58:57.577 --> 59:01.957
- No. No, lord, it was me and me alone.
- Why did he not stop you?

59:02.082 --> 59:04.292
You cannot blame Ragnar
for the abbot's death.

59:04.418 --> 59:05.919
- Yes, I can and I do.
- That is unfair.

59:06.044 --> 59:08.714
- He will stand trial.
- No.

59:18.849 --> 59:20.934
You are a great warrior, Uhtred.

59:22.769 --> 59:24.730
ALFRED: You are a Saxon
who is also a Dane.

59:24.855 --> 59:27.858
The very embodiment
of the England that must emerge.

59:30.569 --> 59:32.612
I request that you enter my service.

59:36.575 --> 59:40.912
Lord, I have been a slave.

59:42.330 --> 59:44.040
I wish to remain a free man.

59:44.166 --> 59:46.209
What is it that you wish
for Earl Ragnar?

59:46.793 --> 59:47.878
Lord, please.

59:48.003 --> 59:50.589
A man of God was slaughtered.
That cannot be ignored.

59:50.714 --> 59:55.802
Someone must answer. It will be you
or it will be Earl Ragnar.

59:57.095 --> 59:58.680
ALFRED: You may choose.

01:00:00.474 --> 01:00:03.143
Your sword, Uhtred.

01:00:04.144 --> 01:00:07.063
You can be a free man within my service.

01:00:07.189 --> 01:00:10.567
- Ragnar goes free?
- He has earned it.

01:00:14.154 --> 01:00:15.572
Swear.

01:00:21.203 --> 01:00:24.331
- I, Uhtred of Beb...
- It is the custom to kneel.

01:00:26.583 --> 01:00:27.918
(INHALES)

01:00:40.514 --> 01:00:45.477
I, Uhtred of Bebbanburg, pledge my sword
to you, Alfred of Wessex.
