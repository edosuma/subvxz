00:45.603 --> 00:47.204
Everybody here?

00:50.508 --> 00:52.441
Are they coming or what?

00:52.443 --> 00:54.176
Davie, this is
down to you, mate.

00:54.178 --> 00:55.009
Down to me?

00:55.011 --> 00:56.244
As it is, down to me?

00:56.246 --> 00:59.481
He's just running
off, mate, a bit of DP.

00:59.483 --> 01:00.316
It's bad, isn't it?

01:00.318 --> 01:01.250
Just hold still.

01:01.252 --> 01:02.518
It's fuckin' bad.

01:02.520 --> 01:03.953
Boys, this is an
office with CCTV.

01:03.955 --> 01:05.620
The only way out is
back the way we came.

01:05.622 --> 01:07.623
Well, those Russian fucks
better be ready for us.

01:07.625 --> 01:09.625
Yeah, 'cause that worked
out so fuckin' well before,

01:09.627 --> 01:10.459
didn't it?

01:10.461 --> 01:11.560
Fuck off!

01:11.562 --> 01:12.927
Everyone get
something they can use.

01:12.929 --> 01:14.129
They're not fuckin'
about, are they?

01:14.131 --> 01:16.265
Yeah well, neither
are we, mate.

01:16.267 --> 01:18.203
Boys, here they come.

01:19.970 --> 01:21.337
Vince, come and hold this.

01:21.339 --> 01:22.206
Keep it still.

01:24.642 --> 01:25.944
Come on then!

01:31.982 --> 01:34.415
Well, that don't
sound too friendly.

02:00.678 --> 02:01.913
Ed, Ed!

02:12.690 --> 02:14.623
Come on, get out!

02:14.625 --> 02:16.558
Come on, Vince.

02:16.560 --> 02:17.395
Let's go!

02:18.429 --> 02:19.264
Come on.

02:20.597 --> 02:22.030
Fuck you!

02:22.032 --> 02:23.698

Hey English,
shut the fuck up.

03:41.412 --> 03:43.545
Fuck you, Russian wanker.

03:43.547 --> 03:45.780
Oy Ed, what's Russian for cunt?

03:45.782 --> 03:47.448
I think it's
spelled D, A, V, I, E.

03:47.450 --> 03:48.784
Not sure how you
pronounce it though.

03:51.454 --> 03:52.453
What?

03:52.455 --> 03:54.125
Russian for cunt!

03:57.227 --> 03:59.028
Oy mate, in the next cell.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.529
You're a (speaking in
a foreign language).

04:00.531 --> 04:05.100
I'm Polish, and I speak
fucking English, you idiot.

04:09.139 --> 04:10.805
Don't stop you
being a cunt, does it?

04:10.807 --> 04:13.208
Davie mate, shut the fuck
up, or I'll knock you out.

04:13.210 --> 04:14.610
You're getting on my nerves.

04:14.612 --> 04:17.045
You're the main
reason we're in here.

04:17.047 --> 04:18.346
You don't see them
Russians looked at me

04:18.349 --> 04:19.180
in the hotels.

04:19.183 --> 04:20.380
Did you not see that?

04:20.382 --> 04:21.583
What, so anyone who
looks at you funny

04:21.584 --> 04:22.617
that's a fucking reason
to kick off, is it?

04:22.619 --> 04:24.085
Technical, mom gives me that.

04:24.087 --> 04:27.155
What did you fuckin' say?

04:27.157 --> 04:28.323
You fuckin' prick.

06:14.631 --> 06:16.800
Agent 58, I need
to speak to Malloy.

06:19.236 --> 06:21.139
Hotel, echo,
November, nine, nine.

06:23.306 --> 06:26.607
Sir, this is not the gulag,
just some drug hangout.

06:26.609 --> 06:27.845
Nothing here but junkies.

06:36.453 --> 06:39.254
Yes, sir.

07:19.462 --> 07:21.830
Yes chief, let's have it.

07:21.832 --> 07:23.301
Come to release us?

07:24.969 --> 07:27.001
What'd we do?

07:27.003 --> 07:27.835
What's all that?

07:27.837 --> 07:30.174
Fuck off with your
fucking camera.

07:32.309 --> 07:33.342
Prick.

07:33.344 --> 07:33.975
What's all that about?

10:31.854 --> 10:33.023
What's that?

10:39.629 --> 10:42.597
What the fuck is this?

15:25.248 --> 15:26.083
Tom?

15:28.819 --> 15:29.654
Tom?

15:30.486 --> 15:32.188
Yes, mate.

15:34.457 --> 15:37.391
Jeff, come
on man, wake up.

15:37.393 --> 15:38.027
Vince?

15:39.830 --> 15:41.862
All right, fuck off.

15:41.864 --> 15:43.366
It's you I know.

15:50.340 --> 15:51.709
You all right?

15:59.883 --> 16:01.516
Shush.

16:05.254 --> 16:06.087
Fuck this.

16:06.089 --> 16:07.521
Davie, wait.

16:07.523 --> 16:08.490
What the fuck?

16:08.492 --> 16:10.290
Who are you?

16:10.292 --> 16:11.492
Davie, calm down.

16:11.494 --> 16:13.761
Who the fuck are
you, and where are we?

16:13.763 --> 16:15.929
Davie, stop being a
cunt just for two seconds

16:15.931 --> 16:17.464
till we find out
what's going on.

16:17.466 --> 16:18.565
Tom's right.

16:18.567 --> 16:20.200
Why don't you give it a
rest you fuckin' halfwit.

16:20.202 --> 16:22.237
All I see is four of
them and five of us.

16:22.239 --> 16:24.439
And a Beretta, 15
rounds in a clip,

16:24.441 --> 16:26.207
enough to do all of
us and then some.

16:26.209 --> 16:27.976
All right Mr. SA
fuckin' S, why don't you

16:27.978 --> 16:29.109
show us your stones
then, hey grandad, hey!

16:29.111 --> 16:29.944
Go on!

16:52.369 --> 16:55.002
Yeah, we don't
speak Ruskie, mate.

16:55.004 --> 16:57.104
There is no way out.

16:57.106 --> 16:59.109
We must wait for
my boss Dimitry.

17:00.476 --> 17:03.213
If you are calm before he
arrives, then no one gets hurt.

17:04.380 --> 17:08.249
If you do not listen,
I will shot not to kill

17:08.251 --> 17:12.086
just to injure so you may
be conscious for Dimitry's

17:12.088 --> 17:13.354
questions.

17:13.356 --> 17:15.123
What the fuck
is happening here Ed?

17:16.827 --> 17:18.059
Some nasty Russian's pointing
a gun at your head, Jeff.

17:18.060 --> 17:19.527
So do as he says.

17:24.867 --> 17:25.834
Fuck this.

17:25.836 --> 17:26.470
Fucker!

18:00.070 --> 18:00.905
Stop!

18:03.340 --> 18:04.809
You, translate.

18:06.408 --> 18:07.244
Let us out.

18:12.415 --> 18:13.049
Help me.

18:14.117 --> 18:16.251
He needs an ambulance!

18:16.253 --> 18:17.618
What are we gonna do?

18:26.562 --> 18:29.465
Boys, Davie mate,
please stay awake.

18:35.304 --> 18:36.439
Stay awake, Davie.

18:37.674 --> 18:39.440
Get us out of here.

18:39.442 --> 18:42.079
It's locked from the outside.

18:43.245 --> 18:46.647
No one's getting out
of here, not even us.

18:46.649 --> 18:48.418
We have to wait for Dimitry.

18:49.285 --> 18:50.353
And, who's Dimitry?

18:51.921 --> 18:53.089
It's the boss.

18:57.293 --> 18:58.128
Your turn.

19:08.705 --> 19:11.239
Ed, what are we doing?

19:11.241 --> 19:13.010
Get him in the van.

19:14.176 --> 19:17.113
Vince mate, we will be
next if we don't hurry.

19:19.049 --> 19:20.682
Vince, we all love Davie,
but we haven't got time

19:20.684 --> 19:21.950
to think about
what's just happened.

19:21.952 --> 19:23.084
He's gone.

19:23.086 --> 19:24.319
He's dead.

19:24.321 --> 19:26.721
Get him in the back of
the van, out of sight.

19:26.723 --> 19:28.959
It's not gonna do you
any good to dwell on it.

19:29.959 --> 19:32.092
This wasn't us.

19:32.094 --> 19:36.063
They did this, and they
will do the same to us.

19:36.065 --> 19:37.531
You think this Dimitry
character is gonna be happy

19:37.533 --> 19:39.235
about what we've
done to his boys?

19:41.036 --> 19:42.569
Tom, help Vince out with Davie.

19:42.571 --> 19:44.038
Can't we just hot wire
this thing and ram it

19:44.040 --> 19:46.007
against the door?

19:46.009 --> 19:46.974
You're gonna need
a stick of dynamite

19:46.976 --> 19:48.342
to get through that thing.

19:48.344 --> 19:50.079
I was a site foreman.

19:51.747 --> 19:53.417
Big fuck off
drill might do it.

19:54.551 --> 19:56.153
I don't see of
those laying about.

19:58.388 --> 19:59.389
Gimmie a hand.

20:42.331 --> 20:45.369
Cut me some seat
belts and some wire.

20:59.282 --> 21:02.019
What are you going to do now?

21:03.052 --> 21:04.287
Find us a way out.

21:10.560 --> 21:12.626
What are we gonna do, boys?

21:12.628 --> 21:15.128
We're gonna wait for
Ed to do his thing.

21:34.184 --> 21:36.783
Now you're going to tell
me how my friends and I

21:36.785 --> 21:39.555
can escape this little pickle
we've found ourselves in.

21:50.500 --> 21:51.702
What is Russian for exit?

21:55.839 --> 21:57.105
What?

21:57.107 --> 21:58.709
Speak nice and clearly for me.

22:22.866 --> 22:25.566
He's been tortured
himself, you know?

22:25.568 --> 22:27.401
Told me one night while
he was out of his nut

22:27.403 --> 22:28.769
on disco biscuits.

22:28.771 --> 22:30.238
This is where we
muse at the efficacy

22:30.240 --> 22:31.608
and morality of torture.

22:33.243 --> 22:35.443
I ain't got a clue

22:39.381 --> 22:40.583
what you just said.

22:41.551 --> 22:43.153
Just be glad he's on our side.

22:44.686 --> 22:46.253
All right.

22:46.255 --> 22:48.723
Boys, I'm not up for this.

22:48.725 --> 22:51.692
I sit at a computer desk all
day staring at spreadsheets.

22:51.694 --> 22:53.860
Vince, we're
fuckin' in it, mate,

22:53.862 --> 22:55.762
whether you like it or not.

23:08.211 --> 23:10.278
There are three warehouses
all joined together

23:10.280 --> 23:12.213
but no exits.

23:12.215 --> 23:14.182
There are at least
two guards armed

23:14.184 --> 23:16.787
with assault rifles on watchtowers
around the perimeter.

23:17.954 --> 23:19.419
I didn't hear him speak.

23:19.421 --> 23:22.225
I've seen
it with my own eyes.

23:24.526 --> 23:26.729
That sounds a health
and safety nightmare.

23:47.516 --> 23:49.317
There's a service hatch.

23:49.319 --> 23:50.654
It's used for maintenance.

23:52.288 --> 23:54.222
It does not lead to the
outside, but it does lead

23:54.224 --> 23:55.525
to the next warehouse.

23:56.458 --> 23:58.425
This is not good for you.

23:58.427 --> 24:00.895
Dimitry is the only
one that can command

24:00.897 --> 24:02.963
the doors to be opened.

24:02.965 --> 24:04.667
We are all captives here.

24:05.801 --> 24:06.637
Good enough.

24:08.503 --> 24:10.273
Where is this service hatch?

24:19.014 --> 24:19.815
Ask him.

24:30.260 --> 24:33.327
All right Ed, what are
we gonna do about Davie?

24:33.329 --> 24:35.296
Well, we can't take
him with us now, can we?

24:35.298 --> 24:36.530
We can't just leave him here?

24:36.532 --> 24:38.765
Yes, we can just
leave him here.

24:38.767 --> 24:40.401
This is fucked up.

24:40.403 --> 24:41.868
There must be another
way out of this.

24:41.870 --> 24:42.705
Listen to Ed.

24:43.773 --> 24:44.608
I'm good.

24:46.341 --> 24:48.675
Well, let's just stand
around here moping about.

24:48.677 --> 24:50.278
Yeah all right, point taken.

24:50.280 --> 24:51.712
But, why not we just hold on
for just one second, yeah?

24:51.714 --> 24:52.946
Hold on, what Jeff?

24:52.948 --> 24:53.780
Come on.

24:53.782 --> 24:56.283
Follow me.

24:56.285 --> 24:58.985
Listen, can't we just wait
for this Dimitry character

24:58.987 --> 25:01.489
to show up, and when he
opens the door, we just jump

25:01.491 --> 25:02.292
the bastard?

25:03.025 --> 25:04.825
Guards with guns, Jeff.

25:04.827 --> 25:06.396
You saw what happened to Davie.

25:07.830 --> 25:09.396
Yeah, but I don't see
why we should have to run

25:09.398 --> 25:10.630
and hide.

25:10.632 --> 25:12.500
We ain't done fuck all wrong.

25:12.502 --> 25:14.434
I don't think these lot care
too much about that, Jeff.

25:14.436 --> 25:16.604
We've got a corrupt copper
and a Russian mentalist

25:16.606 --> 25:20.308
so far in the middle of
fucking we don't know where.

25:20.310 --> 25:21.975
And, I, for one, don't
fancy using this thing

25:21.977 --> 25:23.743
against a bunch of Russians
with tactical gear.

25:23.745 --> 25:24.614
But, go ahead.

25:26.482 --> 25:27.915
Now this Dimitry has
clearly made this door

25:27.917 --> 25:29.082
a bottle neck, so we're
gonna have to find

25:29.084 --> 25:30.151
another way out.

25:30.153 --> 25:31.652
But, if you want to Butch
and Sundance it, mate,

25:31.654 --> 25:32.623
be my guest.

25:38.026 --> 25:38.861
Come on.

27:10.419 --> 27:12.455
Too soon for a joke?

27:13.089 --> 27:14.358
Why, go on.

27:15.324 --> 27:18.894
It's not about Davie,
may he rest in peace.

27:21.731 --> 27:24.434
He'd have ended up in
prison soon enough anyway.

27:25.868 --> 27:27.100
But, he'd still
be alive at least,

27:27.102 --> 27:28.738
and that would've
been his choice.

27:29.871 --> 27:31.541
We're in this
mess because of him.

27:32.742 --> 27:33.808
We're in this
mess because you started

27:33.810 --> 27:35.041
that fight back in France.

27:35.043 --> 27:38.178
What you on about,
you fucking diff?

27:38.180 --> 27:40.513
They ain't the same
fucking Russians.

27:40.515 --> 27:42.081
There's more than one
dickhead bunch of Russians.

27:42.083 --> 27:42.916
You don't know that.

27:42.918 --> 27:43.751
They could be the same.

27:43.753 --> 27:45.519
Shut up you idiots.

27:45.521 --> 27:47.390
So, what's the joke?

27:49.859 --> 27:52.396
What's this tunnel and
Vince's mom got in common?

27:54.096 --> 27:57.030
They've both had four geezers
stuck inside 'em at once.

28:02.103 --> 28:04.038
Again, with the mom jokes.

28:04.040 --> 28:05.873
Give it a rest,
you fucking retard.

28:05.875 --> 28:07.508
That's what she fucking said.

28:11.580 --> 28:13.582
No time for short jokes.

29:17.847 --> 29:19.713
English,
show yourselves.

29:21.551 --> 29:24.117
You
are rats in a maze.

29:27.857 --> 29:28.923
I am the Minotaur.

29:28.925 --> 29:30.957
You are the hunted.

29:30.959 --> 29:32.127
I am the hunter.

29:33.728 --> 29:35.863
I think he's
mixing his metaphors.

29:35.865 --> 29:37.697
I don't think he
gives a fuck mate.

29:44.005 --> 29:46.042
Two years ago, you
killed my comrade.

29:46.943 --> 29:48.945
Now it is your time to die.

29:50.146 --> 29:52.011
So it is the
same fucking Russians.

29:52.013 --> 29:52.846
You're right.

29:52.848 --> 29:54.213
I concede.

29:54.215 --> 29:55.683
That's big for you, Jeff.

30:00.590 --> 30:03.693
Someone give us
a hand with this.

30:06.329 --> 30:07.563
Tom.

31:48.798 --> 31:52.732
If some guy spots us,
it's game over, boys.

33:06.207 --> 33:07.941
Get changed.

33:31.032 --> 33:32.299
What do we do now?

33:32.301 --> 33:34.902
We need to split up
and look for an exit.

33:34.904 --> 33:35.868
There must be a way out.

33:35.870 --> 33:37.337
No, I'm not up for this.

33:37.339 --> 33:40.072
What happened to armed
guards, and assault rifles,

33:40.074 --> 33:41.308
and all that?

33:41.310 --> 33:43.810
There has to be
another way out.

33:43.812 --> 33:45.878
If we stay in here, we're dead.

33:45.880 --> 33:47.848
Yeah, but none of us know
where the fuck we're going.

33:47.850 --> 33:50.017
We'll take it in sections.

33:50.019 --> 33:52.152
We'll meet back here
in five minutes.

33:52.154 --> 33:52.989
Yeah.

33:53.856 --> 33:54.858
Okay.

35:13.002 --> 35:13.634
Where's Tom?

35:13.636 --> 35:14.668
I don't know.

35:14.670 --> 35:15.601
Give him a minute or so.

35:15.603 --> 35:17.137
He might've found something.

35:17.139 --> 35:18.105
Any luck?

35:18.107 --> 35:19.639
Fuck all.

35:19.641 --> 35:21.308
Everywhere's bolted.

35:21.310 --> 35:23.009
It's like a fucking fortress.

35:23.011 --> 35:23.879
Or a prison.

35:24.947 --> 35:25.915
Yeah, right.

35:29.518 --> 35:31.083
That didn't sound good.

35:31.085 --> 35:33.420
Ed, where the fuck you going?

35:33.422 --> 35:34.654
Ed?

37:16.290 --> 37:17.526
Where are your friends?

37:21.797 --> 37:24.000
Did you kill my
comrade in France?

37:38.480 --> 37:40.679
That
was my brother.

37:43.118 --> 37:44.320
Did you kill my brother?

37:59.234 --> 38:00.766
Are you a warrior?

38:27.429 --> 38:28.261
Tom, on your feet.

38:28.263 --> 38:29.297
Don't fuck about.

38:30.398 --> 38:31.331
Come here.

38:37.538 --> 38:38.640
Get off me.

38:39.741 --> 38:41.842
I can help you, or I can
break your arm right now.

38:41.844 --> 38:43.212
No, please.

38:45.413 --> 38:46.212
Let him go.

38:46.214 --> 38:47.049
You're empty.

38:47.882 --> 38:49.349
What?

38:49.351 --> 38:50.553
All rounds expended.

38:55.523 --> 38:57.190
What about now?

38:57.192 --> 38:58.657
We need to get out of here.

38:58.659 --> 39:01.328
They're gonna be all over
this place in seconds.

39:01.330 --> 39:01.964
Please.

39:03.866 --> 39:05.435
Tom, go and get the others.

39:06.701 --> 39:07.703
We'll be in here.

39:09.237 --> 39:09.869
What are you gonna do?

39:09.871 --> 39:11.074
Just quick as you can.

39:12.773 --> 39:13.609
In.

40:16.737 --> 40:18.737
Your boys killed my friend.

40:18.739 --> 40:20.775
And, your lot killed
Dimitry's brother.

40:21.877 --> 40:23.779
So that was a good
fucking move, wasn't it?

40:30.219 --> 40:33.320
I'm guessing he's
talking about two years ago

40:33.322 --> 40:34.253
in self defence.

40:34.255 --> 40:35.487
He was about to kill Jeff.

40:35.489 --> 40:37.424
I should be at the football.

40:37.426 --> 40:39.826
I don't need to explain
to you what's going on here.

40:39.828 --> 40:41.663
You've seen it for yourself.

40:42.598 --> 40:44.431
These people are slaves.

40:44.433 --> 40:45.998
Dimitry runs things.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
I am here to put a stop to it.

40:48.002 --> 40:51.304
Yeah, that's
what it looks like.

40:51.306 --> 40:52.706
Well, I'll just get
this computer working.

40:52.708 --> 40:53.910
You can type all that up.

40:55.277 --> 40:57.346
Two years, I've
been working at this.

40:58.813 --> 41:02.250
Boris, I was in with Boris.

41:04.018 --> 41:07.355
All I have to do is get
the location to MI6.

41:09.391 --> 41:10.956
Secret agent, yeah?

41:10.958 --> 41:14.027
It's called an
intelligence officer, Ed.

41:14.029 --> 41:15.996
But, you already know that.

41:15.998 --> 41:18.831
You're not long out
yourself, are you?

41:18.833 --> 41:20.032
Seeing as you're
out of the regiment,

41:20.034 --> 41:21.735
you're back in the shit.

41:21.737 --> 41:23.505
I'd say about three years ago.

41:29.677 --> 41:31.411
What the fuck are
we doing with her?

41:31.413 --> 41:32.945
I can help you.

41:32.947 --> 41:35.047
Yeah, after what
you lot did to Davie?

41:35.049 --> 41:37.583
If it wasn't for you
fuckwits, I could've made

41:37.585 --> 41:38.985
a call by now.

41:38.987 --> 41:41.353
I would've swiped
Dimitry's satellite phone,

41:41.355 --> 41:43.389
called the location into HQ.

41:43.391 --> 41:45.291
Oh yeah, that old chestnut.

41:45.293 --> 41:46.795
Can you find a way out?

41:48.297 --> 41:49.262
It's my first time here.

41:49.264 --> 41:51.431
I know as much about
the layout as you do.

41:51.433 --> 41:53.300
Well then you have
absolutely no fucking use

41:53.302 --> 41:54.601
to us, are ya?

41:54.603 --> 41:56.402
I can still get
close to Dimitry.

41:56.404 --> 41:58.505
I can help you from afar.

41:58.507 --> 42:00.572
We need to get out of here.

42:00.574 --> 42:04.411
Please, he has a satellite
phone before you interrupted...

42:04.413 --> 42:07.380
I just don't get why
he's so pissed off with us.

42:07.382 --> 42:10.050
Apparently, it was
Dimitry's brother we killed

42:10.052 --> 42:10.886
in France.

42:13.087 --> 42:16.690
Technically speaking, you
killed his brother in France.

42:16.692 --> 42:18.692
You and the rest of those
Russians are bad news.

42:18.694 --> 42:20.659
What do you
bring to the party?

42:20.661 --> 42:22.829
I'm an accountant.

42:22.831 --> 42:23.666
And you?

42:25.067 --> 42:27.366
Tap dancer, what's if
fucking got to do with you?

42:27.368 --> 42:28.567
Great.

42:28.569 --> 42:30.369
Hello, don't you
want to know what I can

42:30.371 --> 42:31.473
bring to the table?

42:34.109 --> 42:35.645
Ed, what are we gonna do?

42:38.346 --> 42:40.112
Ed, if we let this bitch
go, she is gonna lead

42:40.114 --> 42:42.114
that bastard right to us.

42:42.116 --> 42:43.585
He's gonna find you anyway.

42:45.052 --> 42:47.487
None of us are getting
out of here alive.

42:47.489 --> 42:50.489
Ed, all I have is from Boris.

42:50.491 --> 42:52.391
I found it in the
safe about a week ago.

42:52.393 --> 42:54.429
I haven't had a chance
to analyse it yet.

43:31.500 --> 43:33.132
It wasn't enough for
six to have the layout,

43:33.134 --> 43:35.134
they need the exact location.

43:35.136 --> 43:36.936
I thought that would
show me a way back out,

43:36.938 --> 43:38.641
but this place is
locked up tight.

43:40.674 --> 43:42.409
Ed?

43:42.411 --> 43:43.045
Ed?

43:44.011 --> 43:44.846
Ed?

43:46.982 --> 43:47.813
Ed?

43:47.815 --> 43:49.416
Shut up.

43:49.418 --> 43:50.384
Ed listen.

43:50.386 --> 43:51.550
The longer we stay in
here, the more we end up

43:51.552 --> 43:52.485
like sitting ducks.

43:52.487 --> 43:54.487
You got that right.

43:54.489 --> 43:55.721
Do you reckon you can
get his phone then,

43:55.723 --> 43:56.556
get us out of here?

43:56.558 --> 43:57.393
I can try.

43:58.592 --> 44:00.061
Well I can't
just sent you back.

44:03.464 --> 44:04.764
Keep him busy.

44:04.766 --> 44:07.069
Hopefully in the chaos,
I can swipe the phone.

44:07.969 --> 44:09.071
You sure about this?

44:10.105 --> 44:10.969
Yeah.

44:10.971 --> 44:12.471
What?

44:12.473 --> 44:14.206
You can't just send me
back without a scratch

44:14.208 --> 44:15.108
it would look suspect.

44:15.110 --> 44:17.110
We need our struggle
to look authentic

44:17.112 --> 44:20.480
like we fought, and
I'm lucky to be alive.

44:20.482 --> 44:21.516
This is fucked.

44:23.451 --> 44:24.486
I'm sorry.

44:32.594 --> 44:34.828
Vince hits harder than that.

44:34.830 --> 44:35.630
His mom does.

44:36.665 --> 44:38.030
Why is it always my mom?

44:52.246 --> 44:54.079
We have to do
whatever it takes.

44:54.081 --> 44:55.114
Hey man, this is dark.

44:55.116 --> 44:57.016
Whatever it takes, Ed.

44:57.018 --> 44:59.422
Let's just hope this works.

45:02.690 --> 45:03.523
It's okay.

45:03.525 --> 45:04.556
It's okay.

47:48.656 --> 47:53.058
Somewhere on this wall is
a way into the next building.

49:45.005 --> 49:46.239
What the fuck?

49:46.241 --> 49:49.844
I think he's forgot
we don't speak Russian.

50:00.288 --> 50:02.255
There's the door.

50:02.257 --> 50:05.894
I'm gonna find something
to help open it.

50:19.406 --> 50:21.175
What did he just say?

50:22.810 --> 50:24.812
You die, or we all do.

50:27.549 --> 50:29.217
I just needed more time.

50:32.520 --> 50:33.755
I couldn't get the phone.

50:36.924 --> 50:38.326
I can still do this.

50:40.460 --> 50:41.863
I've come this far.

50:45.433 --> 50:48.300
Just think of all
those people suffering

50:48.302 --> 50:49.304
because of Dimitry.

50:53.107 --> 50:54.810
You do what you
think is right.

50:57.978 --> 50:59.214
All of those people, Ed.

51:00.848 --> 51:02.383
We can all still
get out of this.

51:04.418 --> 51:06.288
You can't trust him
to keep his word.

51:07.221 --> 51:11.424
I'm sorry.

51:11.426 --> 51:13.094
Whatever it takes.

51:20.634 --> 51:21.869
Move!

51:23.605 --> 51:24.840
Ed, Ed!

51:27.040 --> 51:27.909
Stay down.

51:30.043 --> 51:31.643
Still think he trust you?

51:31.645 --> 51:32.978
He's coming.

51:32.980 --> 51:33.880
How do we get out of this one?

51:33.882 --> 51:35.083
For fuck's sake, Jeff.

51:50.098 --> 51:52.500
Keep pressure on the wound.

51:56.003 --> 51:57.072
Bright ideas?

51:58.906 --> 52:00.942
I need a distraction.

52:29.136 --> 52:30.201
Ed!

52:36.511 --> 52:38.076
Ed!

52:38.078 --> 52:40.313
Ed, you all right?

52:42.449 --> 52:43.384
Oh, fuck!

52:55.697 --> 52:57.195
Fuck.

52:57.197 --> 52:58.000
Oh, fuck!

53:09.009 --> 53:10.278
Shit, move, move.

53:11.311 --> 53:12.244
They're both down.

53:12.246 --> 53:14.413
I have no idea if they're dead.

53:17.752 --> 53:18.583
Come on.

53:18.585 --> 53:19.687
Quick, quick.

53:33.467 --> 53:34.632
Fuck!

53:34.634 --> 53:37.003
You gotta keep
pressure on the wound.

53:37.973 --> 53:39.771
We're go and look for
more medical supplies.

53:39.773 --> 53:41.507
He's losing a lot of blood.

53:41.509 --> 53:45.643
Ed, Ed, listen I know none
of this is your fault, mate.

53:45.645 --> 53:47.279
Shut up talking bollicks.

53:47.281 --> 53:48.116
You'll be fine.

53:55.489 --> 53:59.558
Jeff, I'm not gonna like
this is gonna hurt like fuck.

53:59.560 --> 54:00.793
Bite down.

54:00.795 --> 54:01.793
What the fuck
are you doing, Ed?

54:01.795 --> 54:02.762
On three.

54:02.764 --> 54:03.999
No, no.

54:07.435 --> 54:09.735
What the fuck are you doing?

54:15.442 --> 54:16.277
Oh fuck.

54:17.511 --> 54:21.047
Ed mate, is there something
you're not telling us about?

54:21.049 --> 54:23.315
Did they feed you funny
pills in the SAS or what?

54:23.317 --> 54:24.817
I'm just doing what needs
to be done to keep us alive,

54:24.819 --> 54:25.951
Vince.

54:25.953 --> 54:27.719
This building has six floors
probably something to do

54:27.721 --> 54:29.521
with more drug stuff,
something they want to hide.

54:29.523 --> 54:32.224
It'll be dug into the ground
to avoid heat signatures.

54:32.226 --> 54:33.625
Standard evasion
for the thermals

54:33.627 --> 54:34.726
on our surveillance drones.

54:34.728 --> 54:37.329
It means more places for
us to hide though, yeah?

54:37.331 --> 54:39.165
More places for us
to get lost more like.

54:39.167 --> 54:40.766
If it is heat they're
trying to avoid,

54:40.768 --> 54:42.835
there'll be some kind of vent
whether it's a human sized

54:42.837 --> 54:44.804
vent or some other clever
device, we won't know

54:44.806 --> 54:46.137
until we look around.

54:46.139 --> 54:47.206
It could be a machine.

54:47.208 --> 54:49.074
There's literally hundreds
of ways you can expel

54:49.076 --> 54:50.375
heat from underground.

54:50.377 --> 54:51.844
Oh fuck.

54:51.846 --> 54:52.677
All right, we're gonna go
look for more medical supplies.

54:52.679 --> 54:54.415
Tom, you stay with
this lot, yeah.

54:57.250 --> 54:58.085
Just in case.

54:59.119 --> 55:00.351
What about you?

55:00.353 --> 55:01.654
I'll whim it as always.

55:01.656 --> 55:03.025
It usually works.

55:09.197 --> 55:10.663
You're enjoying
this, aren't you?

55:10.665 --> 55:12.230
I'm loving it.

55:12.232 --> 55:13.699
Routine.

55:13.701 --> 55:16.268
Eat, sleep, buy some guns,
stab your mate with a player.

55:16.270 --> 55:17.138
Happens all the time.

55:19.840 --> 55:22.108
We are going no where
fast unless we find

55:22.110 --> 55:22.842
Dimitry's satellite phone.

55:22.844 --> 55:23.809
I know.

55:23.811 --> 55:25.643
We're gonna have to wait
for him to come to us

55:25.645 --> 55:27.779
and somehow avoid
being butchered.

55:27.781 --> 55:30.215
He's got more firepower
than us, and this is

55:30.217 --> 55:31.282
his domain.

55:31.284 --> 55:33.319
What is this place called?

55:33.321 --> 55:36.154
According to the map,
it's called The Traffic.

55:36.156 --> 55:38.292
I think there's an ebb
and flow of people here.

55:39.460 --> 55:41.192
Boris, he used to joke
about how many women

55:41.194 --> 55:43.295
he fucked when he was
back here like he was

55:43.297 --> 55:44.829
part of their
initiation or something.

55:44.831 --> 55:46.331
He sounds a lovely bloke.

55:46.333 --> 55:48.134
Oh yeah, one of the best.

55:48.136 --> 55:51.770
So guns, drugs, and
people trafficking.

55:51.772 --> 55:55.206
Everything is about money
and control with these people.

55:55.208 --> 55:56.344
Nothing else matters.

55:57.777 --> 55:59.344
So you think there may
be some other people here,

55:59.346 --> 56:01.313
people that could help?

56:01.315 --> 56:04.550
Maybe people who are
scared out of their wits.

56:04.552 --> 56:07.255
Russia is a breeding
ground for sex slaves.

56:08.456 --> 56:10.559
We are in the middle
of fucking nowhere.

56:12.493 --> 56:13.659
Boris drove us out here.

56:13.661 --> 56:15.263
There's nothing for miles.

56:16.230 --> 56:18.132
It's the perfect place
for a hub like this.

56:20.768 --> 56:24.639
All the drugs and the people
are under Dimitry's control.

56:26.907 --> 56:31.911
After all this time and
effort, Dimitry's gonna

56:31.913 --> 56:33.115
kill us all.

56:35.183 --> 56:38.119
If we die, all of
this is for nothing.

56:39.319 --> 56:41.320
Well then we don't die.

56:41.322 --> 56:44.255
We get the phone, we
call it in, save the day.

56:44.257 --> 56:46.458
Poet of your
squadron, were you?

56:46.460 --> 56:48.594
The reality is mostly
drinking tea and fartin'

56:48.596 --> 56:50.197
waiting for something to do.

56:51.299 --> 56:52.801
I got that down to a fine art.

56:54.201 --> 56:55.536
There's no good
tea in Russia, Ed.

57:57.264 --> 57:58.933
He's gonna need
some water at least.

58:01.335 --> 58:02.637
Where the fuck are they?

58:03.804 --> 58:06.441
They'll be back
just be patient.

58:10.478 --> 58:11.313
Shit.

58:12.313 --> 58:13.381
Tom, Tom?

58:14.281 --> 58:14.913
Where the fuck you going?

58:14.915 --> 58:16.482
What are you doing?

58:18.585 --> 58:19.587
Buy you some time.

58:22.989 --> 58:23.824
Fuck it.

58:26.694 --> 58:28.059
I'm gonna lead
them a merry dance.

58:28.061 --> 58:29.663
I'll be back for some water.

58:30.598 --> 58:32.063
Be careful.

58:48.882 --> 58:50.317
The same in every language.

59:12.105 --> 59:14.373
I just want to go home.

59:27.654 --> 59:29.087
Sounds like your girl.

59:29.089 --> 59:30.655
Yeah, I think so.

59:36.931 --> 59:38.429
Here.

59:38.431 --> 59:39.431
Make like you're with Dimitry.

59:39.433 --> 59:40.565
Ow.

59:40.567 --> 59:41.800
Personally attending
the new batch.

59:41.802 --> 59:43.805
One of these girls
must know a way out.

01:00:29.549 --> 01:00:30.482
Convincing?

01:00:30.484 --> 01:00:31.449
No.

01:00:31.451 --> 01:00:32.486
Fuck it.

01:01:17.197 --> 01:01:18.400
Thank you.

01:01:19.567 --> 01:01:20.402
You okay?

01:01:22.235 --> 01:01:23.471
Yeah.

01:01:24.237 --> 01:01:27.509
It's just the look
I was going for.

01:01:30.610 --> 01:01:32.210
Ed.

01:01:32.212 --> 01:01:33.046
Natalia.

01:01:34.781 --> 01:01:35.616
Hi.

01:01:36.551 --> 01:01:38.753
My friend is in urgent
need of medicine.

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:42.186
Do you know where
we can find any?

01:01:42.188 --> 01:01:44.121
Anything to ease the pain?

01:01:44.123 --> 01:01:45.224
Yes,
they drug the girl.

01:01:45.226 --> 01:01:46.891
They drug me too.

01:01:46.893 --> 01:01:48.562
Two days I have been here.

01:01:51.598 --> 01:01:52.630
Hey, hey, that's enough.

01:01:52.632 --> 01:01:53.264
He has keys.

01:01:53.266 --> 01:01:54.469
Get the keys.

01:01:59.507 --> 01:02:01.572
Medicine, you know where?

01:02:01.574 --> 01:02:02.609
Yes.

01:02:03.543 --> 01:02:04.645
What about others?

01:02:05.513 --> 01:02:06.848
We'll come back for them.

01:02:28.835 --> 01:02:31.003
Had to be vodka.

01:02:31.005 --> 01:02:32.304
Anything?

01:02:32.306 --> 01:02:35.040
Nothing on the radio
for about 10 minutes.

01:02:35.042 --> 01:02:36.478
I don't like this.

01:02:37.277 --> 01:02:39.046
Oh well, could be worse.

01:02:41.549 --> 01:02:42.583
How?

01:03:00.833 --> 01:03:02.569
We should get back.

01:03:55.054 --> 01:03:58.123
I ain't got not fucking
clue what you're saying, mate

01:04:05.799 --> 01:04:09.237
Point the gun
at the floor, Vince.

01:04:10.371 --> 01:04:11.706
Where's Tom?

01:04:13.172 --> 01:04:16.375
He went looking for water.

01:04:20.714 --> 01:04:22.282
Get me out of this.

01:04:24.183 --> 01:04:25.817
Natalia.

01:04:25.819 --> 01:04:26.654
Vince.

01:04:27.821 --> 01:04:29.357
She's not gonna
bite you, Vince.

01:04:32.426 --> 01:04:34.092
Fuck a duck, that hurts.

01:04:34.094 --> 01:04:36.130
No time
to fuck ducks, Vince.

01:04:37.397 --> 01:04:39.831
It's a
figure of speech.

01:05:16.436 --> 01:05:18.704
They've got Tom.

01:05:18.706 --> 01:05:20.105
He said if we don't
face him in 10 minutes,

01:05:20.107 --> 01:05:21.739
he's gonna kill him.

01:05:21.741 --> 01:05:22.409
He's got Tom?

01:05:23.810 --> 01:05:26.177
He said hand to
hand, bare hands,

01:05:26.179 --> 01:05:28.480
this warrior thing
he's obsessed with.

01:05:28.482 --> 01:05:30.715
Not content with the
speed of a bullet.

01:05:30.717 --> 01:05:32.654
Wants it up close
and personal, does he?

01:05:33.987 --> 01:05:35.089
What are we gonna do?

01:05:37.056 --> 01:05:38.259
Come with me a minute.

01:05:47.768 --> 01:05:49.134
The reason I joined
up in the first place

01:05:49.136 --> 01:05:51.770
was because I thought
I had a screw loose.

01:05:51.772 --> 01:05:55.777
So I went to war,
fought for my country,

01:05:58.344 --> 01:06:00.045
and then watched as
one by one my mates

01:06:00.047 --> 01:06:01.416
were killed in front of me.

01:06:05.886 --> 01:06:10.891
These boys, these boys have
been here since day one,

01:06:12.759 --> 01:06:14.161
school mates, you know?

01:06:15.763 --> 01:06:18.230
Always there to pick me
up when it weren't going

01:06:18.232 --> 01:06:19.067
so well.

01:06:21.534 --> 01:06:24.105
And, I will do anything
to get 'em out of here.

01:06:25.806 --> 01:06:30.811
I get like a tunnel
vision, like blind rage,

01:06:32.513 --> 01:06:33.748
you understand?

01:06:37.784 --> 01:06:38.418
Got it.

01:06:48.362 --> 01:06:49.795
The kip out diet.

01:06:49.797 --> 01:06:51.032
Sorry it's been days.

01:06:52.299 --> 01:06:53.898
Where is he?

01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:55.837
He said basement
level minus two.

01:06:57.270 --> 01:06:59.871
So he's below us knowing
full well that there's

01:06:59.873 --> 01:07:01.840
no exit on this
floor or the next.

01:07:01.842 --> 01:07:02.877
Probably.

01:07:03.810 --> 01:07:04.845
Shit.

01:07:06.145 --> 01:07:06.980
So now what?

01:07:08.214 --> 01:07:10.181
Jump up and down,
hope for asbestos.

01:07:10.183 --> 01:07:11.248
I don't fuckin' know, Vince.

01:07:11.250 --> 01:07:12.183
Give me a minute.

01:07:12.185 --> 01:07:13.453
Let's give up the ghost, mate.

01:07:14.822 --> 01:07:16.822
All you need
is a sat phone, right?

01:07:16.824 --> 01:07:18.190
Yeah.

01:07:18.192 --> 01:07:19.427
If we go, we're fucked.

01:07:20.828 --> 01:07:23.395
If we stay here,
then they kill Tom,

01:07:23.397 --> 01:07:26.898
and then they come looking
for us, and we're fucked.

01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:27.935
Yeah.

01:07:33.507 --> 01:07:34.342
Okay.

01:07:40.913 --> 01:07:42.614
This is what we're gonna do.

01:07:53.092 --> 01:07:57.329
♪ You are a cunt ♪

01:07:57.331 --> 01:08:00.297

You all right, Tom?

01:09:37.731 --> 01:09:39.066
Peachy mate, peachy.

01:09:40.366 --> 01:09:42.000
He's been teaching me the.

01:09:42.002 --> 01:09:44.068
Going well, is it?

01:09:44.069 --> 01:09:45.205
Not bad, mate.

01:10:50.536 --> 01:10:53.738
He wants to play
Russian roulette.

01:11:08.088 --> 01:11:08.723
No, no!

01:11:44.191 --> 01:11:45.192
Ladies first.

01:11:46.392 --> 01:11:48.126
No, no, hold on,
mate, take me first.

01:11:50.597 --> 01:11:52.296
Tom, Tom!

01:11:56.136 --> 01:11:58.368
It's like being
bitten by your mom.

01:11:58.370 --> 01:11:59.239
Shut up, you cunt.

01:12:06.146 --> 01:12:07.181
Enough.

01:12:08.115 --> 01:12:09.150
Come on!

01:12:10.683 --> 01:12:11.619
You and me.

01:12:53.493 --> 01:12:55.260
Now would be good!

01:13:37.704 --> 01:13:38.873
Oh definitely.

01:14:30.022 --> 01:14:32.927
Agent 58, I need
to speak to Malloy.

01:14:34.026 --> 01:14:36.529
Hotel echo,
November, nine, nine.

01:14:39.331 --> 01:14:41.565
Have found location.

01:14:41.567 --> 01:14:44.868
Repeat, have found location.

01:14:44.870 --> 01:14:46.871
Trace this call.

01:14:46.873 --> 01:14:48.375
Trace this call.

01:14:55.714 --> 01:14:57.317
The old axe in
the heart trick.

01:15:00.786 --> 01:15:01.621
Disgusting.

01:15:06.058 --> 01:15:07.628
Vince mate, you good?

01:15:09.295 --> 01:15:10.731
Yeah, I'm good.

01:15:12.632 --> 01:15:15.835
You know Natalia,
I meant make the hole

01:15:19.606 --> 01:15:21.072
with the axe and
pass the gun through,

01:15:21.074 --> 01:15:23.344
not the other way around.

01:15:24.611 --> 01:15:26.978
I'm sorry it was
easier for me this way.

01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:27.848
You did okay.

01:15:29.014 --> 01:15:29.850
So kind.

01:15:35.387 --> 01:15:36.256
So what now?

01:15:39.058 --> 01:15:40.561
We wait for the cavalry.

01:15:42.329 --> 01:15:43.597
How long's that gonna take?

01:15:45.999 --> 01:15:46.900
They didn't say.

01:15:48.401 --> 01:15:50.935
How long's that sort
of thing normally take?

01:15:50.937 --> 01:15:53.440
How long's a piece of
string for fuck's sake.

01:15:54.641 --> 01:15:56.073
If anything not friendly
walks through that door,

01:15:56.075 --> 01:15:56.909
shoot it.

01:15:59.579 --> 01:16:01.415
What am I gonna use?

01:16:02.981 --> 01:16:06.350
How long's it take to bleed out?

01:16:06.352 --> 01:16:07.351
It depends.

01:16:07.353 --> 01:16:08.118
Just stop talking, mate.

01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:09.220
You'll be fine.

01:16:09.222 --> 01:16:11.521
Unless there's another
load of guards on the way.

01:16:11.523 --> 01:16:13.390
In which case...

01:16:13.392 --> 01:16:15.328
Here, use this.

01:16:22.968 --> 01:16:23.870
Cheers, mate.

01:16:28.475 --> 01:16:29.677
Vince.

01:16:31.477 --> 01:16:32.312
What?

01:16:33.847 --> 01:16:36.417
Do you reckon your mom
will visit me in hospital?

01:16:39.919 --> 01:16:40.921
Fuck off.

01:17:08.047 --> 01:17:10.384
That didn't sound Russian.
