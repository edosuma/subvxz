Natural boobs are supposed to
have a little slack to them.

00:07.374 --> 00:08.842
They're supposed to
have a little hang time.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.244
I don't want no hang time.

00:10.244 --> 00:12.379
I'm gonna get them pumped up.

00:12.379 --> 00:13.914
They need to be pumped up.

00:13.914 --> 00:15.949
They're kind of laying
down and they're like--

00:15.949 --> 00:18.418
Sandra, you-- that's rude.

00:18.418 --> 00:19.620
-Hey, guys.
-What's up?

00:19.620 --> 00:20.420
What's going on?

00:20.420 --> 00:21.221
Speaking of boobs.

00:21.221 --> 00:24.358
We're talking about
boobs, and here you come.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.793
Sandra, you're the worst
about making someone

00:26.793 --> 00:28.328
feel bad about their boobs.

00:28.328 --> 00:30.030
I'd rather have those.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.665
-I always have to wear a bra.
-Look, these even jiggle.

00:31.665 --> 00:32.499
Sandra.
-Baby twerk.

00:32.499 --> 00:35.602
Baby twerk, baby twerk,
baby twerk, baby twerk--

00:35.602 --> 00:37.437
That doesn't work for
Miss Sandra, OK boo-boo?

00:37.437 --> 00:38.238
Come on, Sandra.

00:38.238 --> 00:39.373
You have to do a baby twerk.

00:39.373 --> 00:41.241
I am a professional woman.

00:41.241 --> 00:44.111
I'm here to make outfits,
not to shake my butt, OK?

00:44.111 --> 00:45.245
Just a little
shimmy shake-shake.

00:45.245 --> 00:46.580
I don't know how.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.382
Trey knows how to
do a little twerk.

00:48.382 --> 00:49.816
Girl, I don't work
unless it's for my man

00:49.816 --> 00:51.418
or I'm getting a check.

00:51.418 --> 00:53.654
Just because you're married
doesn't mean you can't twerk.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.122
You're trying to force
everybody to twerk.

00:55.122 --> 00:57.724
Let's see you twerk.

00:57.724 --> 00:58.825
Introducing first--

00:58.825 --> 01:01.161
Come on, Sandra.

01:01.161 --> 01:02.095
Sandra.

01:02.095 --> 01:02.963
Yeah, $2.

Pow.

01:03.764 --> 01:04.864
$2.

Oh.

This is my bounce kitty kitty.

There it is.

01:11.204 --> 01:12.005
I don't know--

01:12.005 --> 01:12.806
But even that's--

01:12.806 --> 01:13.707
Am I doing it?

01:13.707 --> 01:15.576
Miss Sandra.

01:15.576 --> 01:16.710
You really tried it.

01:16.710 --> 01:18.045
I'm sorry, nothing moving.

01:18.045 --> 01:20.581
My twerk don't work like that.

Good.

So have you guys seen this?

01:37.030 --> 01:37.831
No.

little spot at the top.

01:39.333 --> 01:40.133
That's cute.

01:40.133 --> 01:41.602

OK, show us

Oh damn girl, you know
the number and everything.

That is so awesome.

Wait, isn't this

you go in there for one thing--

02:35.222 --> 02:36.757
You get like
bronzer and glitter--

02:36.757 --> 02:37.624
Spend like $200 in there.

02:37.624 --> 02:42.162
Oh yeah, I spent $200 on
eyelashes, self-tanner, lotion.

02:42.162 --> 02:42.963
I was like, oh my gosh.

02:42.963 --> 02:43.764
Oh, my gosh.

Because I want to be prepared
for when I go to New York.

02:46.299 --> 02:47.601
What's in New York?

02:47.601 --> 02:49.436
Well I'm doing a
signing in New York,

02:49.436 --> 02:50.437
and TJ's gonna come with me.

So TJ and I never-- like,
you know, we never do

02:55.942 --> 02:57.044
vacations unless it's, like--

02:57.044 --> 02:57.844
With work.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.446
I mean, it's always with work.

02:59.446 --> 03:00.547
You guys need alone time.

03:00.547 --> 03:02.049
That's what I said to TJ.

03:02.049 --> 03:04.084
I really want to take advantage
of some time for ourselves.

03:04.084 --> 03:04.885
Yeah, of course.

03:04.885 --> 03:07.387
New York's a great city to,
like, do, like, romantic things

03:07.387 --> 03:08.255
and have fun.

03:08.255 --> 03:10.257
Yeah, you guys are gonna, like,
get it in when you go there.

03:10.257 --> 03:11.058
Perfect.

03:11.058 --> 03:13.527
Well as excited as I
am about this signing,

03:13.527 --> 03:16.329
I'm almost more excited that
TJ and I are going to have

03:16.329 --> 03:17.998
a little romantic getaway.

03:17.998 --> 03:21.835
This trip is long
overdue, and I can't wait.

03:21.835 --> 03:24.004
I have no idea what we're
gonna do with the cats,

03:24.004 --> 03:25.939
because my mom usually
always looks after them,

03:25.939 --> 03:27.441
but she and my dad are
not gonna be in town.

03:27.441 --> 03:29.476
I'm almost feeling like I should
cancel this trip to New York

03:29.476 --> 03:30.377
because I have no clue--
-No--

03:30.377 --> 03:31.344
That is dumb.

03:31.344 --> 03:33.246
They have those,
like, pet hotels.

03:33.246 --> 03:34.047
Oh yeah, you do.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.215
Oh, I feel bad.

03:35.215 --> 03:37.751
You know what, maybe--
maybe I can watch

03:37.751 --> 03:38.885
Louis and Charlotte for you.

03:38.885 --> 03:41.755
You guys don't even
live in the same coast.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.657
I know, but I'm thinking
we'd have live events

03:43.657 --> 03:45.559
and have that loop
in Florida, so that'd

03:45.559 --> 03:46.426
actually kind of work out.

03:46.426 --> 03:47.928
And I have friends
in Tampa, too,

03:47.928 --> 03:49.730
and I could just double-check
with Vinnie, and then

03:49.730 --> 03:50.564
maybe it could be, like--

03:50.564 --> 03:51.865
-Oh, that's nice.
-Vinnie could come down.

03:51.865 --> 03:53.433
Yeah, like a little
vacation for us, too.

03:53.433 --> 03:53.600
So--

03:53.600 --> 03:54.701

love that, Ari.

butt cheeks are showing.

Oh, really?

04:23.063 --> 04:24.464
Because it's a summer dress.

you a pair of these?

yourself some, so.

Not in that shirt.

got our veggies, right?

serious right now?

I feel like at
times TJ's too nice.

it's at the expense of us.

can hear everything

Why would you get
us adjoining rooms?

15:59.392 --> 16:02.829
Not only are these animals put
in these small little cages,

16:02.829 --> 16:04.831
but they're abused daily.

16:04.831 --> 16:06.866
Nikki really isn't getting it.

16:06.866 --> 16:07.667
Look at this.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.502
These are, like,
factory chicken.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.437
This is how they're treated.

16:11.437 --> 16:12.338
That's, like, in the farms.

16:12.338 --> 16:13.473
That can't be a live chicken.

16:13.473 --> 16:14.273
Look at this.

16:22.548 --> 16:24.450
Oh my god, I can't
even watch this.

16:24.450 --> 16:25.551
How do you watch--

16:25.551 --> 16:27.053
He's beating the pig up.

16:27.053 --> 16:27.987
Look at.

16:27.987 --> 16:28.788
Oh my god.

16:38.698 --> 16:42.168
Oh my god, I can't even.

16:42.168 --> 16:43.703
Oh my god.

16:43.703 --> 16:46.072
It's so disturbing
and sad to me,

16:46.072 --> 16:47.640
like I want to burst into tears.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.609
My stomach hurt, my heart hurts.

16:49.609 --> 16:51.210
Like, it's screaming for help.

16:51.210 --> 16:52.211
Turn it off, Briana.

16:52.211 --> 16:53.880
Seriously.
It's like a little too much now.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.047
But that's literally
what happens.

16:55.047 --> 16:57.550
OK, but can we just-- like
honestly, it's too much now.

17:01.053 --> 17:02.054
This a big-ass party.

17:02.054 --> 17:04.089
Why all these people
at Nattie's house?

17:04.089 --> 17:05.657
I know Nattie don't
know about this.

17:05.657 --> 17:07.093
Hi.

17:07.093 --> 17:08.560
He didn't knock on
the door or nothing.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.963
I don't even know who
that is, to be honest.

17:10.963 --> 17:13.266
We need to spend
our money wisely.

17:13.266 --> 17:14.666
You became my accountant
all of a sudden?

17:14.666 --> 17:15.300
I'm your wife.

17:15.300 --> 17:16.636
I'm more important
than your accountant.

17:22.008 --> 17:25.944
[MUSIC PLAYING]

17:28.915 --> 17:30.383
Hi, how are you?

17:30.383 --> 17:32.051
We were just talking about you.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.586
-Oh, no.
-Everybody's saying good things.

17:33.586 --> 17:34.387
Oh, good.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.288
How are you?

17:35.288 --> 17:36.088
I'm fine.

17:36.088 --> 17:37.156
How are you doing?

17:37.156 --> 17:39.725
This whole "Flex" photoshoot
has brought so many

17:39.725 --> 17:41.027
different opportunities to me.

17:41.027 --> 17:43.629
We are at the "OK"
magazine studios.

17:43.629 --> 17:46.098
I'm doing interviews
there for OK!TV.

17:46.098 --> 17:48.200
It's just a really
exciting time for me.

17:48.200 --> 17:49.669
I'm so happy right
now to be sitting

17:49.669 --> 17:52.238
next to the beautiful
and very strong and super

17:52.238 --> 17:53.506
fabulous, Natalia.

17:53.506 --> 17:56.208
Of course, you came from
this, like, royal family

17:56.208 --> 17:57.009
of wrestlers.

17:57.009 --> 17:58.744
And you have built
the body of a god.

17:58.744 --> 17:59.545
Oh, thank you.

17:59.545 --> 18:02.048
And now you are in magazines.

18:02.048 --> 18:04.283
You are in the latest
"Flex" magazine.

18:04.283 --> 18:05.084
Oh, man.

18:05.084 --> 18:08.120
Well first of all, being
in a fitness magazine

18:08.120 --> 18:10.590
has been sort of like a
lifelong dream of mine,

18:10.590 --> 18:13.459
to show that women
can be sexy and strong

18:13.459 --> 18:17.797
and not have to be your
quintessential bodybuilder

18:17.797 --> 18:19.365
or quintessential supermodel.

18:19.365 --> 18:23.169
It's about showing how you make
yourself sexy when you embrace

18:23.169 --> 18:26.238
every curve, you embrace
every muscle that you have,

18:26.238 --> 18:28.207
you shake what
your mama gave you.

18:28.207 --> 18:30.743
And that's everything that this
"Flex" magazine shoot is about,

18:30.743 --> 18:31.544
and I think it's great.

18:31.544 --> 18:32.612
Thanks so much for stopping by.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.180
Yeah, thanks for having me.

18:34.180 --> 18:38.084
[MUSIC PLAYING]

18:40.686 --> 18:41.487
Ew.

18:41.487 --> 18:44.924
None of this looks good.

18:44.924 --> 18:47.460
Ew.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.260
What?

18:48.260 --> 18:50.596
I can't even eat.

18:50.596 --> 18:52.765
You're not gonna eat anything?

18:52.765 --> 18:53.566
No.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.501
I'm disgusted.

18:55.501 --> 18:58.004
Brie's really been on my
case lately about eating

18:58.004 --> 18:59.138
the right type of meat.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.139
And now I get it.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.475
I can't stop getting
the vision of the pigs

19:02.475 --> 19:04.076
out of my head, the screams.

19:04.076 --> 19:06.512
Like, I can't eat,
I have nightmares.

19:06.512 --> 19:09.749
I just-- this sucks.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.851
Just because I show you
bad videos doesn't mean you

19:11.851 --> 19:12.852
have to stop eating chicken.

19:12.852 --> 19:14.720
You just have to make
sure it's free range.

19:14.720 --> 19:15.521
Is that free range?

19:15.521 --> 19:16.722
So you know this is free range?

19:16.722 --> 19:18.057
-Yes.
-How?

19:18.057 --> 19:18.991
I talked to Jessica before.

19:18.991 --> 19:19.792
She told me.

19:21.927 --> 19:24.597
Heath, I used to
love meat until Brie

19:24.597 --> 19:27.266
showed me how chickens
are treated in factories.

19:27.266 --> 19:29.402
Because you can't eat
any of the chickens

19:29.402 --> 19:31.570
that are in factories, or
any of the factory eggs.

19:31.570 --> 19:33.139
It was the saddest
video I've ever seen,

19:33.139 --> 19:34.974
and I honestly can't
eat meat because of it.

19:34.974 --> 19:37.977
But aren't like most chickens
are in the factories, right?

19:37.977 --> 19:40.880
They're factory farmed,
which means they usually never

19:40.880 --> 19:42.148
even see the light of day.

19:42.148 --> 19:44.650
They were, like, hanging
half-dead in nastiness.

19:44.650 --> 19:45.985
It's sad.

19:45.985 --> 19:47.453
I may not even want
to eat this chicken.

19:47.453 --> 19:49.088
See?

19:49.088 --> 19:50.523
Do you want anything else?

19:50.523 --> 19:51.791
Is this good to eat?

19:51.791 --> 19:52.792
Yes, it's good to eat.

19:52.792 --> 19:53.592
You sure?

19:53.592 --> 19:55.127
They're happy chickens.

19:55.127 --> 19:57.930
I told her that you made
sure that this was free range.

19:57.930 --> 19:58.898
Yes.

19:58.898 --> 20:01.734
I know, but after seeing
the video of how the chickens

20:01.734 --> 20:03.502
are treated, like
maybe hopefully

20:03.502 --> 20:05.604
soon I'll get my appetite back.

20:05.604 --> 20:06.405
Thanks, Jess.

20:06.405 --> 20:08.274
I think I'm gonna
go throw up now.

20:08.274 --> 20:09.675
Later, hippies.

20:09.675 --> 20:14.880
Thanks for the loss
of appetite again.

Serafina.

20:26.025 --> 20:27.393
Hi.

20:27.393 --> 20:30.796
People are already lined
up at Barnes & Noble.

20:30.796 --> 20:31.597
Oh, wow.

20:31.597 --> 20:32.398
Is that a fan?

20:32.398 --> 20:33.899
Yeah, I feel
like-- I don't know,

20:33.899 --> 20:35.468
I'm having anxiety
about the signing.

20:35.468 --> 20:38.270
You've done signings before.

20:38.270 --> 20:40.773
So do you guys want to
eat, or are you gonna text?

20:40.773 --> 20:42.875
I'm gonna put my phone away.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.811
So I wanted to thank you.

20:45.811 --> 20:46.979
-For what?
-For the money.

20:46.979 --> 20:48.114
Oh yeah, no problem.

20:48.114 --> 20:49.849
I think that that's
really gonna help.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.383
I think it's a good
investment, to be honest.

20:51.383 --> 20:52.184
That's great.

20:52.184 --> 20:55.054
What is the money,
like, what's this for--

20:55.054 --> 20:57.857
For a bouncy castle,
like a bouncy house.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.191
I know nothing of this.

20:59.191 --> 21:00.893
You know, it's between
TJ and his sister.

21:00.893 --> 21:04.897
Every time she needs something,
she privately talks to TJ.

21:04.897 --> 21:07.767
I found this really
cool giant bouncy castle,

21:07.767 --> 21:09.835
and I think it would be a
really good investment, too.

21:09.835 --> 21:11.670
We could lend it out,
rent it out for parties.

21:11.670 --> 21:15.474
And I was wondering if you'd
be able to pay for that.

21:15.474 --> 21:17.877
I just wish TJ would've
talked to me about it first.

21:17.877 --> 21:19.612
How much was the bouncy castle?

21:19.612 --> 21:21.247
Well it's about
five grand for a new.

21:21.247 --> 21:23.048
$5,000?

21:23.048 --> 21:24.717
Yeah.

21:24.717 --> 21:27.853
Which I mean, in the overall
happiness of the children,

21:27.853 --> 21:29.655
Nattie, is not that bad.

21:29.655 --> 21:31.257
No, Valerie, I'm
not saying it's

21:31.257 --> 21:32.458
not like good for
the kids, I'm just

21:32.458 --> 21:35.928
saying, like, I didn't even
know that TJ was doing this.

21:35.928 --> 21:38.597
The only thing is is that
we had also just bought

21:38.597 --> 21:41.400
my mom and dad a car,
so we didn't have like--

21:41.400 --> 21:42.234
we had just budgeted--

21:42.234 --> 21:43.803
Which of course, spending
that money is not a problem.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.171
When we bought my
mom and dad the car,

21:45.171 --> 21:46.272
did I not talk to you about it?

21:46.272 --> 21:47.072
No, no, no.

21:47.072 --> 21:50.109
It was already like a done
deal, and I just paid half.

21:50.109 --> 21:52.545
My point is, we need to
spend our money wisely--

21:54.079 --> 21:55.047
Yeah.

21:55.047 --> 21:55.981
Yeah, but cat?

21:55.981 --> 21:57.716
What does my cat have
to do with anything?

21:57.716 --> 21:58.684
Just the price.

21:58.684 --> 22:00.085
You're complaining
about the money,

22:00.085 --> 22:01.287
and then you're
spending it, right?

22:01.287 --> 22:02.688
Valerie, this has
nothing to do with you,

22:02.688 --> 22:04.957
so I'd appreciate it if you
wouldn't like-- but a husband

22:04.957 --> 22:06.225
and a wife discuss finances--

22:06.225 --> 22:07.159
But that's his money--

22:07.159 --> 22:09.929
They discuss things that
they invest in together.

22:09.929 --> 22:10.996
I don't make my own money?

22:10.996 --> 22:13.799
I'm not able to help out
if I want to help out?

22:13.799 --> 22:15.367
But I don't know,
like why would you--

22:15.367 --> 22:15.534
I have to go through you?

22:15.534 --> 22:16.902
You became my accountant
all of a sudden?

22:16.902 --> 22:18.537
You're not my accountant.
-I never said--

22:18.537 --> 22:19.371
Are you my accountant?

22:19.371 --> 22:20.172
I'm--

22:20.172 --> 22:20.973
Yes or no.

22:20.973 --> 22:21.774
TJ, I am your wife.

22:21.774 --> 22:23.676
I'm more important
than your accountant.

22:23.676 --> 22:26.345
I just can't believe the
things that TJ is saying.

22:26.345 --> 22:27.112
I'm hurt.

22:27.112 --> 22:28.214
I'm pissed off.

22:28.214 --> 22:29.849
I feel like I don't
even have a voice.

22:29.849 --> 22:32.284
I'm so mad, I just
want to go home.

22:32.284 --> 22:35.487
She'll take the check.

22:35.487 --> 22:36.989
I didn't think she
would be so mad.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.528
Where are we going?

22:42.528 --> 22:44.463
Wait till you see.

22:44.463 --> 22:46.098
So should we try
and catch a chicken?

22:46.098 --> 22:46.899
Yes.

22:46.899 --> 22:49.068
If these chickens start
pecking at my Louis Vuitton,

22:49.068 --> 22:50.469
we're gonna definitely
have issues.

22:54.306 --> 22:57.443
Yo man, this is a
big-ass party, man.

22:57.443 --> 22:59.345

keep going down.

Where are we going?

23:12.124 --> 23:13.158
Is it somewhere for lunch?

23:13.158 --> 23:13.959
Wow.

23:13.959 --> 23:14.760
I haven't been hungry.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.762
I saw chickens
smashed in a cage.

23:16.762 --> 23:17.563
Don't.

23:17.563 --> 23:19.398
It just breaks my heart
every time I hear about it.

23:19.398 --> 23:20.165
Your heart?

23:20.165 --> 23:22.468
Imagine my stomach.

23:22.468 --> 23:23.802
Yield to horses?

23:23.802 --> 23:26.305
Remember when I got kicked
in the butt by a horse?

23:26.305 --> 23:27.273
I do remember that.

23:27.273 --> 23:29.074
Literally flew and hit the
fence and got knocked out.

23:29.074 --> 23:30.910
I don't think animals
really like you that much.

23:30.910 --> 23:31.944
Oh, really?

23:31.944 --> 23:32.945
Animals love me.

23:32.945 --> 23:35.447
Because they know you wear
the [BLEEP] out of them.

23:35.447 --> 23:37.816
They appreciate that.

23:37.816 --> 23:39.184
You're gonna make a
left into this farm.

23:39.184 --> 23:42.054
I don't even have the
right shoes for this.

23:42.054 --> 23:44.857
Oh my god, I'm getting
them all muddy.

23:44.857 --> 23:46.592
Aren't you excited?

23:46.592 --> 23:49.495
Well, if I had a cowboy hat,
I'd be a lot more excited.

23:49.495 --> 23:50.696
It's not a country farm.

23:50.696 --> 23:51.597
What are we doing?

23:51.597 --> 23:54.033
Your appetite will come
back after you see all this.

23:54.033 --> 23:55.534
I promise you.

23:55.534 --> 23:57.636
I feel really bad that
I traumatized Nikki,

23:57.636 --> 24:00.873
so I am taking Nikki
to Suzie Farms.

live happy and roam free.

24:06.045 --> 24:06.845
I'm Brie.

24:06.845 --> 24:08.314
This is my sister, Nikki.

24:08.314 --> 24:09.481
Nice to meet you.

24:09.481 --> 24:10.482
Oh my gosh, this is amazing.

24:10.482 --> 24:11.283
Welcome.

24:11.283 --> 24:12.084
That's my dog.

24:12.084 --> 24:13.585
He looks like Brian.

24:13.585 --> 24:15.187
Are you guys ready to
go see the chickens?

24:15.187 --> 24:15.988
Yes.

24:15.988 --> 24:16.789
OK.

24:16.789 --> 24:18.724
So what you can see in
here are our chicken.

24:18.724 --> 24:20.125
Oh my gosh, look at them run.

24:20.125 --> 24:22.127
Would you like to go inside
and walk around with them?

24:22.127 --> 24:22.928
Oh my gosh--

24:22.928 --> 24:23.996
Are they gonna peck at me?

24:23.996 --> 24:24.797
Probably.

24:24.797 --> 24:26.365
They like the color red, so.

24:26.365 --> 24:28.734
Leave the Louis
Vuitton out here.

24:28.734 --> 24:30.869
There's a little
table over there.

24:30.869 --> 24:34.039
OK, if these chickens start
pecking at my Louis Vuitton,

24:34.039 --> 24:36.575
now we're gonna
definitely have issues.

24:36.575 --> 24:37.376
Oh my gosh.

24:37.376 --> 24:38.844
-This is the chicken spa.
-How cute.

24:38.844 --> 24:40.145
So that's how they
clean themselves.

24:40.145 --> 24:42.448
And when they live
inside of a warehouse

24:42.448 --> 24:44.550
with a concrete floor,
they can't do this--

24:44.550 --> 24:45.351
Aw.

24:45.351 --> 24:47.453
Which is why the chickens
get really unhealthy.

24:47.453 --> 24:48.253
Look at their eyes.

24:48.253 --> 24:50.289
Oh my gosh, they are so cute.

24:50.289 --> 24:52.858
They look healthier than
what that video showed me.

24:52.858 --> 24:54.393
They get to live a
real chicken life.

24:54.393 --> 24:56.462
The factory farms where
most of them are in cages,

24:56.462 --> 24:59.698
they live in a napkin
square sized enclosure.

24:59.698 --> 25:01.600
And then the next
tier is cage-free

25:01.600 --> 25:03.369
which is inside a factory
but without cages,

25:03.369 --> 25:04.636
but they're all packed in there.

25:04.636 --> 25:06.038
And then there's
free range, which

25:06.038 --> 25:07.906
means they live
inside mostly but they

25:07.906 --> 25:09.208
have access to the outdoors.

25:09.208 --> 25:11.443
It's mostly concrete, or
it's a screened-in porch.

25:11.443 --> 25:13.212
So what is this considered?

25:13.212 --> 25:14.413
This is called pastured.

25:14.413 --> 25:15.748
So let's see if we
can find some eggs.

25:15.748 --> 25:16.548
What do you think?

25:16.548 --> 25:17.750
OK, yeah, let's do it.

25:17.750 --> 25:18.784
All right, watch out, girls.

25:18.784 --> 25:19.785
You guys have fun.

25:19.785 --> 25:20.619
Nicole, come on.

25:20.619 --> 25:21.420
Come on in.

25:21.420 --> 25:23.756
It's way better
than a factory farm.

25:23.756 --> 25:28.360
I never knew the difference
between free range, cage-free.

25:28.360 --> 25:31.163
Oh my gosh, it's so warm.

25:31.163 --> 25:34.666
These chickens are plumpy, they
look happy, they're healthy,

25:34.666 --> 25:36.935
they're getting
vitamin D from the sun.

25:36.935 --> 25:39.438
This is the food I want to eat.

25:39.438 --> 25:40.706
So should we try
and catch a chicken?

25:40.706 --> 25:41.473
Yes.

25:41.473 --> 25:42.875
I like to call this
the chicken Olympics.

25:46.478 --> 25:49.348
Brie, I think you're
like creeping them out.

25:49.348 --> 25:51.683
I'm going low and slow.

25:51.683 --> 25:53.085
Oh, you can get him, Nicole.

25:53.085 --> 25:56.555
I don't-- I feel like it's
gonna, like, turn and bite me.

25:56.555 --> 25:57.890
Go in.
Just grab her.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.324
-Grab her.
-You guys.

25:59.324 --> 26:00.192
Aw.

26:00.192 --> 26:02.628
Now Bris is actually one of the
hardest ones for us to catch.

26:02.628 --> 26:04.063
I've never really been
able to catch this--

26:06.165 --> 26:06.965

You're OK.

26:07.933 --> 26:08.734
You're so funny.

26:08.734 --> 26:11.103
Well, I do like seeing
how happy they are.

26:11.103 --> 26:13.172
And they're plumpy
and healthy and--

26:13.172 --> 26:14.506
Isn't it crazy, the
difference, Nicole?

26:14.506 --> 26:15.741
Yeah.

26:15.741 --> 26:17.776
There's simple ways
for animals to just

26:17.776 --> 26:19.378
live and be our food as well.

26:19.378 --> 26:20.446
It starts with us.

26:20.446 --> 26:22.347
I will eat local
from here on out.

26:22.347 --> 26:23.482
-Yay.
-Yay.

26:23.482 --> 26:24.483
That's awesome.

26:24.483 --> 26:26.618
If we keep supporting
these factories,

26:26.618 --> 26:27.820
then they're going
to keep existing.

26:27.820 --> 26:29.721
And that's what I'm
trying to tell Nikki.

26:29.721 --> 26:31.123
But I will show
up to local spots

26:31.123 --> 26:32.891
in my Christian Louboutins.

26:32.891 --> 26:33.692
That is all good.

26:33.692 --> 26:34.893
That's one thing
I will not change.

26:34.893 --> 26:37.629
Takes a lot of steps to change
her, but we're making progress.

38:56.234 --> 38:57.569
Hey TJ, I heard that.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.139
I know.

39:01.139 --> 39:04.976
Hey, TJ, hey, TJ, I love your
La-Z-Boy chair you got there,

39:04.976 --> 39:05.777
man.

39:05.777 --> 39:06.578
It's awesome.

39:09.380 --> 39:11.516
I just kicked everyone else.

39:11.516 --> 39:12.750
I'm so sorry about that.

39:12.750 --> 39:14.552
It's just Vinnie and I now.

39:14.552 --> 39:16.020
Hey TJ, TJ, what's up man?

39:16.020 --> 39:17.255
This oose, man.

39:17.255 --> 39:18.723
What the [BLEEP] is going on?

39:18.723 --> 39:20.325
I'm telling you right
now, I tried calling you,

39:20.325 --> 39:21.125
you didn't pick up.

39:21.125 --> 39:22.026
You didn't pick up.

39:22.026 --> 39:22.827
Ari--

39:22.827 --> 39:23.795
I've got to go
to sleep, Nattie.

39:23.795 --> 39:24.929
OK, I'll talk to you tomorrow.

39:24.929 --> 39:26.598
They got a big-ass party
going on here over here.

39:26.598 --> 39:27.899
Ari?

39:27.899 --> 39:28.700
She hung up.

39:28.700 --> 39:29.500
Yeah.

39:29.500 --> 39:31.502
Uh, they're not
going to sleep, Nat.

39:31.502 --> 39:33.438
The fact that they found
the cat is all I care about.

39:33.438 --> 39:34.839
I just don't want to
deal with it anymore.

39:34.839 --> 39:36.407
I wouldn't let them
at my house if I was

39:36.407 --> 39:37.675
there with a team of security.

39:37.675 --> 39:39.210
I'm not blaming
you, but I don't--

39:39.210 --> 39:40.612
No, but you are blaming me.

39:40.612 --> 39:43.047
The good thing is
that Louis is found.

39:43.047 --> 39:45.450
But TJ and I haven't even
talked about the money

39:45.450 --> 39:46.451
that he's giving his sister.

39:46.451 --> 39:47.252
Nat?

39:47.252 --> 39:48.253
Yeah, TJ, what?

39:48.253 --> 39:50.121
Have you recovered
from lunch, or--

39:50.121 --> 39:51.522
Yeah, I've recovered
from all of it.

39:51.522 --> 39:55.326
Why-- are you done scolding
me like I'm a five-year-old?

39:55.326 --> 39:57.729
Are you done scolding me
like I'm a four-year-old?

39:57.729 --> 40:00.298
TJ, I didn't understand why
I was the last person to know

40:00.298 --> 40:01.666
about money that you're
giving your sister

40:01.666 --> 40:02.467
for something that--

40:02.467 --> 40:04.135
So your mom and dad's
car, all your shoes,

40:04.135 --> 40:06.137
all your scarves,
your Louis Vuitton

40:06.137 --> 40:07.872
bags that you don't even use.

40:07.872 --> 40:09.374
Throw another
shrimp on the barbie.

40:09.374 --> 40:10.975
I can't wait to have
another fight with TJ.

40:17.916 --> 40:19.817
I didn't know about money that
you're giving your sister.

40:19.817 --> 40:20.618
Nat--

40:20.618 --> 40:21.986
I don't like you
keeping things from me.

40:21.986 --> 40:23.521
Well I wasn't trying
to keep things from you,

40:23.521 --> 40:25.590
I was just doing a
thing with my sister.

40:25.590 --> 40:27.592
I feel betrayed that
he didn't include

40:27.592 --> 40:30.662
me in such a big decision,
because we're married now.

40:30.662 --> 40:34.065
These are decisions and things
that symbolize our relationship

40:34.065 --> 40:35.533
and our union, being together.

40:35.533 --> 40:38.703
Getting a freaking kids jungle
gym when it snows 10 months

40:38.703 --> 40:39.637
out of the year in Calgary--

40:39.637 --> 40:40.538
Oh, you're exaggerating.

40:40.538 --> 40:41.706
I felt like that
wasn't practical.

40:41.706 --> 40:44.108
My money is your money, and
your money is my money now.

40:44.108 --> 40:46.311
I want us to start embracing
the fact that we are married.

40:46.311 --> 40:48.046
You don't have to remind
you, I know we're married.

40:48.046 --> 40:49.180
I know, but like,
I was so upset

40:49.180 --> 40:51.349
when your sister literally
told you in front of me,

40:51.349 --> 40:52.150
thanks for the money.

40:52.150 --> 40:54.585
Well how do you think I
felt when all of a sudden you

40:54.585 --> 40:56.421
tell me that you bought a
car for your mom and dad.

40:59.457 --> 41:02.727
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
that-- I told you after we had

41:02.727 --> 41:05.129
done it, and I-- I was wrong.

41:05.129 --> 41:06.297
TJ has a point.

41:06.297 --> 41:09.300
My money is TJ's money
and his money is my money.

41:09.300 --> 41:12.303
And I definitely am very
gracious and generous

41:12.303 --> 41:13.104
with my parents.

41:13.104 --> 41:14.372
I'm sorry, TJ.

41:14.372 --> 41:15.173
No, I'm sorry.

41:15.173 --> 41:16.341
I was wrong, too.

41:16.341 --> 41:18.977
I told you, I should have let
you know about my sister's idea

41:18.977 --> 41:20.178
with the bouncy castle.

41:20.178 --> 41:21.913
I didn't want your sister
thinking that I was just

41:21.913 --> 41:24.315
some, you know, whiny bitch.

41:24.315 --> 41:25.216
Like, I'm not like that.

41:25.216 --> 41:26.317
I'm actually extremely
supportive of you--

41:26.317 --> 41:27.118
No, you're not at all.

41:27.118 --> 41:28.753
I support you in
everything we do.

41:28.753 --> 41:30.121
You're my whole life.

41:30.121 --> 41:34.192
Everything you do is,
like, what makes me tick.

41:34.192 --> 41:36.861
We're a team, and we need to
remind ourselves that we're

41:36.861 --> 41:38.329
a very important team.

41:38.329 --> 41:41.065
And Team Nattie and TJ
do everything together.

41:41.065 --> 41:43.234
So if we want to
buy a bouncy castle

41:43.234 --> 41:46.337
and let the kids urinate in
it, we'll do it together.

41:46.337 --> 41:48.740
Any investment going forward,
we have to be on the same page

41:48.740 --> 41:49.974
from the very beginning.

41:49.974 --> 41:53.177
Whenever either one of us want
to buy anything ridiculous,

41:53.177 --> 41:55.346
we talk about it
with each other.

41:55.346 --> 41:56.147
And--

41:56.147 --> 41:56.948
Aye, aye, captain.

41:56.948 --> 41:59.884
By the way, I'll have you know
that my birthday is coming up,

41:59.884 --> 42:02.320
and I'm due for a
new pair of boots.

42:02.320 --> 42:04.055
To go with the other
pairs that you don't wear?

42:04.055 --> 42:07.892
[MUSIC PLAYING]

42:10.294 --> 42:14.198
Oh, jeez it's cold out here.

42:14.198 --> 42:14.999
It's cold.

42:14.999 --> 42:16.401
How do you think Louis feels?

42:16.401 --> 42:17.201
We found him.

42:17.201 --> 42:18.569
That's the main thing.

42:18.569 --> 42:19.837
Yes, that's a relief.

42:19.837 --> 42:21.205
Thank you guys for
helping me find him.

42:21.205 --> 42:22.373
I know it's been
hella stressful.

42:22.373 --> 42:23.941
You are the worst
housesitter ever.

42:23.941 --> 42:24.742
Yes.

42:24.742 --> 42:25.743
You might-- yes.

42:25.743 --> 42:26.577
Stick to your day job.

42:26.577 --> 42:28.479
Yes.

42:28.479 --> 42:30.314
OK, guys, I messed
up a little bit.

42:30.314 --> 42:31.682
Mm, you think?

42:31.682 --> 42:34.218
I just-- I mean, I put
myself in Nattie's shoes.

42:34.218 --> 42:36.387
Like, if someone went to
my house, had a party,

42:36.387 --> 42:37.188
I wouldn't be mad about.

42:37.188 --> 42:38.356
But to lose my dog or--

42:38.356 --> 42:39.424
Yeah, what if they lost Glitty?

42:39.424 --> 42:40.258
I would kill somebody.

42:40.258 --> 42:41.025
Yes.

42:41.025 --> 42:44.062
Hey guys, we're
doing shots, guys.

42:44.062 --> 42:45.997
Now that Louis's taken care
of, that's who you need to be

42:45.997 --> 42:47.065
worried about right there.
-Vinnie.

42:47.065 --> 42:47.632
-Hey--
-Vinnie.

42:47.632 --> 42:48.800
We found Louis,
everything's cool.

42:48.800 --> 42:50.435
Meow.
Inside, we'll take a shot.

42:50.435 --> 42:51.436
You know what, we should
take a shot for finding Louis.

42:51.436 --> 42:52.670
-OK.
-Yeah.

42:52.670 --> 42:55.440
Even though I found Louis, I
know no matter what, Nattie's

42:55.440 --> 42:56.808
still gonna be upset with me.

42:56.808 --> 42:57.875
Cheers to Louis--

42:57.875 --> 42:58.676
Louis, yeah.

42:58.676 --> 42:59.477
Being found.

42:59.477 --> 43:01.446
From the bottom of my
heart, I really am sorry.

43:01.446 --> 43:03.414
Hey guys, I just
wanted to say that I

43:03.414 --> 43:05.450
am so happy I was able
to come back to Tampa

43:05.450 --> 43:06.751
and see all you guys.

43:06.751 --> 43:08.986
Now let's turn the
[BLEEP] up and party.

43:08.986 --> 43:11.923
Woo!

43:11.923 --> 43:14.358
Next time on "Total Divas."

43:14.358 --> 43:16.327
Funk is on a roll.

43:16.327 --> 43:19.263
Ah, it kills me that
Nicole's not here seeing this.

43:19.263 --> 43:20.131
I know.

43:20.131 --> 43:21.099
She's missing out.

43:21.099 --> 43:21.966
Here's our invitations.

43:21.966 --> 43:23.601
Why couldn't you hire
someone to do this?

43:23.601 --> 43:26.003
You could just [BLEEP] off
being my maid of honor, Nicole.

43:26.003 --> 43:29.073
This birth control
implant lasts three years.

43:29.073 --> 43:31.843
For you to go and do it without
telling me, that's shady to me.

43:31.843 --> 43:33.845
This is better than
being surprised with--

43:33.845 --> 43:35.613
Guess we ain't
having no babies.

43:35.613 --> 43:36.714
Are you wearing underwear?

43:36.714 --> 43:38.349
Of course I'm
wearing underwear.

43:38.349 --> 43:40.585
It's now or never.
