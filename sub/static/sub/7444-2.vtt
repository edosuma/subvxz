00:16.541 --> 00:17.974
It's a jungle out there.

00:36.621 --> 00:38.339
It's a jungle out there.

01:01.101 --> 01:02.546
Just drop it, mate.

01:02.581 --> 01:04.301
Know who I am?
I'm the Prince, mate.

01:04.336 --> 01:05.775
Drop it.
You want it?

01:05.810 --> 01:07.214
I'm the Prince. I'm the...

01:15.141 --> 01:17.421
People called
Alphonse Gangitano

01:17.456 --> 01:18.941
the Black Prince of Lygon Street,

01:18.976 --> 01:20.866
and he loved the notoriety.

01:20.901 --> 01:23.141
He loved being referred to
in the media

01:23.176 --> 01:24.781
as a "Melbourne criminal identity",

01:24.816 --> 01:26.226
and "Melbourne crime boss".

01:26.261 --> 01:29.301
But the night
he and his best mate, Jason Moran,

01:29.336 --> 01:30.866
went berserk in a King Street bar

01:30.901 --> 01:32.421
and sent 13 innocent people
to hospital,

01:32.456 --> 01:34.093
they crossed a line.

01:35.141 --> 01:37.941
And we couldn't write it off
as just another underworld dispute.

01:37.976 --> 01:39.786
And Alphonse couldn't write it off

01:39.821 --> 01:41.581
as just another case
of collateral damage,

01:41.616 --> 01:43.266
no matter how much he wanted to.

01:43.301 --> 01:46.741
The reality shocked him and it was
the beginning of the end...

01:46.776 --> 01:48.186
<i>... of everything.</i>

01:48.221 --> 01:50.941
Broken jaw.
Half her dental work's missing.

01:50.976 --> 01:53.661
Took 38 stitches
to close up this bloke's face.

01:53.696 --> 01:55.141
Actually, I think that was 48.

01:55.176 --> 01:56.466
48?

01:56.501 --> 01:59.626
48. We reckon she'll lose her eye.

01:59.661 --> 02:02.461
Guess what she does
for a living, Alphonse.

02:02.496 --> 02:04.146
Photographer.

02:04.181 --> 02:06.066
And what'd you do to this bloke?

02:06.101 --> 02:07.861
Did you put him
through a meat grinder?

02:07.896 --> 02:10.026
I'd like to call my lawyer.

02:10.061 --> 02:12.106
I'd like to see a doctor of my choice.

02:12.141 --> 02:14.106
You'll get access
to your solicitor later.

02:14.141 --> 02:18.581
A doctor, you don't need. These
people needed a doctor, Alphonse.

02:18.616 --> 02:21.421
13 people from that club
needed a doctor.

02:21.456 --> 02:23.426
I'm making no comment.

02:23.461 --> 02:26.476
We've got CCTV footage
plus a bunch of witnesses.

02:26.511 --> 02:29.491
Now, you do yourself a favour.
Make a full statement.

02:32.341 --> 02:34.297
So, who was the other guy
with you, Alphonse?

02:36.501 --> 02:40.361
The other bloke in the coat.
That could be Jason Moran.

02:40.396 --> 02:44.221
He's a known associate of Gangitano.
And that's his walk.

02:44.256 --> 02:46.177
You know how Jason Moran walks?

02:47.661 --> 02:49.413
You know, shoulders over and...

02:53.261 --> 02:55.217
Well, wait till he's face on, alright?

02:57.861 --> 02:59.294
Should get it on the next camera.

03:02.781 --> 03:05.295
Oh, Jesus!

03:09.621 --> 03:11.066
Human error.

03:11.101 --> 03:13.820
Either way, it's bloody useless.
Now we've just got to rely on witnesses.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.261
Do you feel like going
and having a chat with Mr Moran?

03:17.296 --> 03:19.626
Yeah, but he'd just deny it,
wouldn't he?

03:19.661 --> 03:23.821
So, why don't we get ourselves
some proof first?

03:23.856 --> 03:24.776
Yeah?

03:34.621 --> 03:36.066
Virginia, hey!
Hey, what are you doing?

03:36.101 --> 03:38.741
We're going to my sister's.
What are you doing? Hang on a sec.

03:38.776 --> 03:40.426
Girls, come here.
Get in the car.

03:40.461 --> 03:42.461
Get out of my way, Alphonse.
No, no, don't. Don't.

03:42.496 --> 03:44.611
Come here. Leave 'em. Leave 'em!

03:46.341 --> 03:48.341
Mummy and Daddy are gonna
have a little talk, huh?

03:48.376 --> 03:50.571
You go back inside.
Yeah, Dad, whatever.

03:51.981 --> 03:54.221
What, are you leaving without
even a single word of explanation?

03:54.256 --> 03:55.701
I can't do this anymore.
Why not?!

03:55.736 --> 03:57.346
Because it hurts too much.

03:57.381 --> 03:59.861
Come on, you're overreacting.
You're overreacting.

03:59.896 --> 04:02.341
No, I'm doing
what I should have done ages ago.

04:02.376 --> 04:04.826
Get off me! You stink.

04:04.861 --> 04:10.146
The coppers threw me in...
in a drunk tank. Don't you see?

04:10.181 --> 04:14.621
Everybody wants to be the one
that took down Alphonse Gangitano.

04:14.656 --> 04:17.940
Who do you think you are -
Public Enemy Number One?

04:17.976 --> 04:19.386
No.

04:19.421 --> 04:21.440
I'm the man that loves you.

04:21.476 --> 04:23.426
No.
What else is important?

04:23.461 --> 04:25.426
I knew you were different.
I knew you were different.

04:25.461 --> 04:29.741
I knew you weren't a regular guy,
but you're not real anymore.

04:29.776 --> 04:32.414
You're living in some movie
inside your head.

04:37.301 --> 04:38.734
You're not...

04:40.061 --> 04:41.619
You're not allowed to leave me.

04:42.661 --> 04:44.094
You're not allowed to leave me.

04:51.501 --> 04:52.981
Who are you?

04:53.016 --> 04:54.426
Carl Williams?

04:54.461 --> 04:57.426
Detectives Kraus and Owen,
City West Detectives.

04:57.461 --> 05:01.261
This vehicle was seen in King Street
early this morning,

05:01.296 --> 05:03.666
around 2am, outside the Sports Bar.

05:03.701 --> 05:05.701
Can you tell me
what you were doing there, Carl?

05:05.736 --> 05:07.586
Am I under arrest? What for?

05:07.621 --> 05:10.533
It's a simple question, mate.
What's the answer?

05:12.301 --> 05:13.746
Picking up a mate.

05:13.781 --> 05:16.401
Well, we know that was Jason Moran.
That's not the issue.

05:16.436 --> 05:19.021
See, what we don't know is
where you dropped him afterwards.

05:19.056 --> 05:20.534
His joint, Moonee Ponds. Why?

05:21.581 --> 05:23.026
Jason's joint?

05:23.061 --> 05:26.181
And so you took Jason and his mate
Alphonse to the club earlier.

05:26.216 --> 05:27.661
What time would that have been?

05:27.696 --> 05:29.346
I don't know. 1:50.

05:29.381 --> 05:34.296
Right. Only stayed there 5 to 10
minutes? That's a quick drink.

05:35.821 --> 05:37.641
And how come you didn't go in?

05:37.676 --> 05:39.426
I was the designated driver.

05:39.461 --> 05:42.786
Right. Stone-cold sober, were ya?
Yeah.

05:42.821 --> 05:45.141
Well, you would have noticed
that Jason was covered in blood

05:45.176 --> 05:46.586
when he hopped back into the car.

05:46.621 --> 05:49.341
Oh, shit. No, no, I didn't
see nothing like that.

05:49.376 --> 05:51.146
Must have been too dark.

05:51.181 --> 05:52.978
Good thing she was
due for a clean, eh?

05:54.701 --> 05:57.161
And did he mention
where Alphonse had got to?

05:57.196 --> 05:59.968
Look, mate, I don't know
nothin' about nothin'.

06:00.003 --> 06:02.706
I'm just an honest citizen
goin' about me business.

06:02.741 --> 06:05.621
Mate, the only people who ever feel
the need to say that are crooks.

06:05.656 --> 06:09.501
Bald, hmm, nearly bald,
and let me guess...

06:09.536 --> 06:11.906
... bald.

06:11.941 --> 06:14.853
I mean, this vehicle
really is a disgrace.

06:16.701 --> 06:19.261
I really have no choice
but to slap a canary on it.

06:21.501 --> 06:23.821
Owen. Is that what you said?

06:23.856 --> 06:26.106
You're a sphincter, Owen.

06:26.141 --> 06:28.501
That's a technical name
for arsehole.

06:38.181 --> 06:42.541
Mmm, that was good.
Don't tell me that wasn't good.

06:42.576 --> 06:45.977
You're good. You're so good.

06:47.781 --> 06:51.181
Hey, what happened to your hand?

06:51.216 --> 06:55.026
Ah, no, no, just...

06:55.061 --> 06:56.972
<i>... nah, just muckin' up.</i>

06:59.301 --> 07:00.746
Guess what.

07:00.781 --> 07:02.499
I got you a new job.

07:04.181 --> 07:06.626
I don't like you flashing
your boobs at punters all night,

07:06.661 --> 07:10.581
so I got you a nice job, got you
a proper job in a florist shop.

07:10.616 --> 07:12.946
You what?
It's OK. It's alright.

07:12.981 --> 07:14.981
It belongs to a guy I know
called the Munster.

07:15.016 --> 07:16.494
Graham Kinniburgh.

07:17.541 --> 07:22.061
He's an ugly bastard,
but he's a good guy. You'll like him.

07:22.096 --> 07:25.497
Jason, who asked you to interfere?

07:27.221 --> 07:30.061
Come on, darl. Look, I'm just...
I'm just lookin' out for you, OK?

07:30.096 --> 07:33.690
Oh, I suppose he's sort of like
an uncle to me and Mark.

07:36.261 --> 07:42.181
Uh, listen, um, if anyone asks,
I was with you last night, OK?

07:42.216 --> 07:43.626
Come here.

07:43.661 --> 07:45.174
Come here, come here, come here.

08:24.741 --> 08:26.174
Idiot!

08:35.301 --> 08:36.946
Police! Get out of the car!

08:36.981 --> 08:39.139
Get out of the car now.
Open the door!

08:39.174 --> 08:41.297
Open the door!
On the other side!

08:43.461 --> 08:45.581
Get out! Get out!
Get down on the ground!

08:45.616 --> 08:46.666
Jason!

08:46.701 --> 08:49.215
Don't be a fool!
Aargh!

08:52.981 --> 08:54.653
Get him up!

08:57.541 --> 08:59.341
Uh, well, we found
nothing at the house.

08:59.376 --> 09:00.306
What?

09:00.341 --> 09:02.341
Jason must have dumped
all the clothes he was wearing.

09:02.376 --> 09:03.786
There's no trace of it.

09:03.821 --> 09:05.466
What, not even
that flash duffle coat?

09:05.501 --> 09:07.781
Well, he's obviously pulled
this kind of stunt before.

09:07.816 --> 09:09.266
Where is he? Upstairs?

09:09.301 --> 09:12.259
No, he had to go to hospital.
He's not feeling very well.

09:23.341 --> 09:24.786
Mistress Tracey.

09:24.821 --> 09:26.937
I'm surprised you recognised me.

09:28.341 --> 09:30.901
Yours is a face I would not forget.

09:34.701 --> 09:37.621
So, uh, you were with Jason?
How is he?

09:37.656 --> 09:40.426
He's got a head injury.

09:40.461 --> 09:42.850
They won't let me see him yet.
Cops are in there.

09:45.301 --> 09:47.371
I don't even know
what this is about.

09:52.501 --> 09:54.558
It's probably all my fault.

09:54.593 --> 09:56.616
How can it be your fault?

09:59.741 --> 10:05.577
Jason, uh... Jason got involved
in a business dispute of mine.

10:07.501 --> 10:09.626
And, uh... well,
things got out of hand.

10:09.661 --> 10:12.581
If it's serious, I'll never
be able to forgive myself.

10:12.616 --> 10:14.386
If you just follow me
this way, Mrs Moran.

10:14.421 --> 10:16.661
We just have a little bit of
paperwork to fill out

10:16.696 --> 10:18.781
just over at reception,
if you don't mind.

10:18.816 --> 10:20.501
That's Trish, Jason's wife.

10:20.536 --> 10:22.426
Ah.

10:22.461 --> 10:24.861
I wondered what she looked like.

10:24.896 --> 10:26.294
I'll go.

10:29.061 --> 10:31.052
Say hello to him for me.

10:33.021 --> 10:34.500
Not "give him my love"?

10:37.701 --> 10:39.692
Hey, listen, it was, um...

10:40.741 --> 10:42.652
<i>... it was nice seeing you again.</i>

10:46.941 --> 10:51.412
You know, I didn't like you
at first, but you're a nice man.

10:55.101 --> 10:56.534
OK, thank you.

11:46.621 --> 11:49.181
Bless me, Father,
for I have, um, sinned.

11:50.981 --> 11:53.626
It's been a, uh...

11:53.661 --> 11:55.811
<i>... Iong time since
my last confession.</i>

11:57.781 --> 11:59.261
Yeah, it's been a while, actually.

11:59.296 --> 12:02.266
It's... been a long...

12:02.301 --> 12:05.941
<i>... a long while, actually.</i>

12:05.976 --> 12:07.533
How long?

12:10.021 --> 12:13.141
Lester Ellis was a bantam weight.

12:13.176 --> 12:15.053
What does that tell you?

12:15.088 --> 12:16.931
A lot more than you know.

12:26.181 --> 12:28.376
Sorry, Father, false alarm.

12:35.421 --> 12:36.854
Tony Mokbel?

12:38.741 --> 12:41.130
No kidding. That's my name too.

12:42.181 --> 12:45.014
I'm Carl Williams.
Mind if I sit down for a sec?

12:49.381 --> 12:50.826
What can I do for you, Carl?

12:50.861 --> 12:53.898
I just want to say how much
I admire what you've done, Tony.

12:55.581 --> 12:58.539
You want something or you're
just generally arse-licking?

13:00.661 --> 13:02.586
As far as I can figure out,

13:02.621 --> 13:05.781
you supply about 50%
of Melbourne's amphet market.

13:05.816 --> 13:06.746
Yeah? Fair comment?

13:06.781 --> 13:08.681
Mate, if you're working
for the cops,

13:08.716 --> 13:10.546
you're gonna be
severely disappointed.

13:10.581 --> 13:13.181
No, no, no. I work for
the Morans, as a driver.

13:13.216 --> 13:15.746
Call 'em. Check me out.
So, what do you want?

13:15.781 --> 13:19.601
You supply quality merchandise.
Everybody says so.

13:19.636 --> 13:22.968
I want to learn how to cook
and press A-grade E's.

13:23.003 --> 13:26.301
I thought maybe you could
teach me how to do it.

13:26.336 --> 13:28.978
Why don't you ask Mark? Ask Jason?

13:29.013 --> 13:31.620
You're the only guy I respect.

13:33.741 --> 13:35.186
What's in it for me, Carl?

13:35.221 --> 13:38.261
Well, when I set up my operation,
you get a piece.

13:38.296 --> 13:39.946
Oh, a franchise?

13:39.981 --> 13:42.781
Hey, we could set up a chain, huh?
Mokbel's Party World.

13:42.816 --> 13:45.136
Yeah, why not?

13:46.301 --> 13:50.221
How do I know you're not
just a lazy, greedy wannabe, Carl?

13:50.256 --> 13:52.018
Try me.

13:55.061 --> 13:56.574
I don't think so, Carl.

13:58.381 --> 14:00.066
You're asking me to prove I'm not?

14:00.101 --> 14:03.411
I'm not asking you anything.
Piss off, Carl.

14:16.741 --> 14:18.186
Why'd you dog on me, fat boy?

14:18.221 --> 14:20.186
Oh, g'day, Jase.
Good to see you up and about.

14:20.221 --> 14:23.061
You told the jacks I was with
Alphonse, huh? Why'd you do that?

14:23.096 --> 14:24.666
Oh, Jase, them cops,
they lied to me.

14:24.701 --> 14:27.879
This D, Owen, he told me
he already knew you was there.

14:27.914 --> 14:31.057
And you fell for it, huh?
You stupid fat fuckin' moron.

14:36.901 --> 14:39.101
Next time use your fuckin' brain.

14:39.136 --> 14:40.898
Oh, Carl...

14:42.621 --> 14:44.506
Your bonus.

14:44.541 --> 14:46.841
Merry Christmas.

14:46.876 --> 14:49.106
Ta, Jase. You too.

14:49.141 --> 14:52.690
Merry Christmas
to you too, Alphonse!

14:57.661 --> 15:00.666
OK, come on, now, bog in!

15:00.701 --> 15:04.011
Trish has been up to her elbows
in giblets all week.

15:05.821 --> 15:07.381
You boys got enough turkey?

15:07.416 --> 15:08.906
Yes, Mum.
Thanks, Mum.

15:08.941 --> 15:11.186
Now, Jase, should you be drinking?

15:11.221 --> 15:14.141
I remember when Mark's father
used to have concussion,

15:14.176 --> 15:15.621
he could never drink.

15:15.656 --> 15:17.066
Piss off, Mum!

15:17.101 --> 15:19.421
Guys, do you want any more?

15:19.456 --> 15:20.866
Do you want some?

15:20.901 --> 15:24.981
She's worried about ya.
You know who you've got to blame.

15:25.016 --> 15:27.058
It's not Alphonse's fault.

15:27.093 --> 15:29.066
He treats you like shit.

15:29.101 --> 15:31.626
How long are you gonna swallow it?

15:31.661 --> 15:36.581
You're going back inside because
of Alphonse Gangitano, no-one else.

15:36.616 --> 15:39.981
Well, what can I say?
He's like a brother to me.

15:40.016 --> 15:42.779
He's a tumour on your brain.

15:52.301 --> 15:54.178
Stop it!

15:57.021 --> 15:59.701
Stand back! Get out of the way!

15:59.736 --> 16:01.181
What are you doing?

16:01.216 --> 16:02.718
Guys!

16:02.753 --> 16:04.186
Mark!

16:04.221 --> 16:06.461
Leave his head alone.
Hit him in the guts. He's crook!

16:06.496 --> 16:08.461
Merry fuckin' Christmas!
Stop him! Stop it!

16:08.496 --> 16:11.786
Stop it! Cut it out!

16:11.821 --> 16:15.038
What did you think you were doing,
you bloody idiots?

16:15.073 --> 16:18.256
They've got you on toast,
even without the CCTV footage.

16:19.941 --> 16:22.181
The case is only as good as
their strongest witness, yeah?

16:22.216 --> 16:23.786
It only takes one.

16:23.821 --> 16:26.186
So what are you saying?

16:26.221 --> 16:28.066
You want us to enter a plea?

16:28.101 --> 16:31.061
If you fight it
and the court finds against you,

16:31.096 --> 16:32.626
which is a distinct possibility,

16:32.661 --> 16:35.801
given the circumstances
of your arrest,

16:35.836 --> 16:38.941
the sentence, Alphonse,
could be harsh.

16:38.976 --> 16:40.306
Very.

16:40.341 --> 16:45.141
On the other hand, plead guilty
and we skip the trial.

16:45.176 --> 16:47.858
No witnesses to tell
their sob stories,

16:47.893 --> 16:50.541
no juries to get
emotionally involved.

16:50.576 --> 16:53.626
No. No. What, are you kidding?

16:53.661 --> 16:55.901
If I plead guilty,
I'd get kicked out of the family.

16:55.936 --> 16:57.334
Jase, Jase.

16:58.701 --> 17:01.221
So, what do you think
they'd give us?

17:01.256 --> 17:02.866
12 months.

17:02.901 --> 17:05.021
Against, what, two, three years?

17:05.056 --> 17:06.906
Or more.

17:06.941 --> 17:08.661
And you'd be saving on
barrister's fees...

17:08.695 --> 17:10.516
This is fucked.

17:10.550 --> 17:12.336
Fat boy, let's go!

17:13.901 --> 17:16.017
Jase. Ho, Jase, come here.

17:17.701 --> 17:19.146
Maybe he's right, you know?

17:19.181 --> 17:21.621
It makes sense. How are we gonna
get to all these witnesses?

17:21.656 --> 17:23.425
It only takes one of them
to sink us.

17:23.461 --> 17:25.721
Listen, listen, listen,
you plead guilty, I go down too.

17:25.756 --> 17:27.945
Did you think about that, huh?
It may be for the best.

17:27.981 --> 17:30.781
We do a year, paesan. So what?
What are you, a fuckin' lulu, huh?

17:30.816 --> 17:32.214
What the fuck is up your arse?

17:51.341 --> 17:53.721
Hey...

17:53.756 --> 17:56.101
Hey, Jase.

17:56.136 --> 17:57.090
Jase!

17:59.061 --> 18:01.450
Jase! Jase, Jase!

18:30.141 --> 18:33.381
Another skull fracture?
Uh-huh.

18:33.416 --> 18:34.706
You? Why?

18:34.741 --> 18:36.697
If he dies, it's my fault.

18:37.981 --> 18:39.699
I'm not so sure.

18:40.941 --> 18:43.694
I've got a feeling
Jason's writing his own ticket.

18:47.021 --> 18:48.841
Why do you say that?

18:48.876 --> 18:50.604
What, you love him?

18:50.639 --> 18:52.333
In a way. Do you?

18:54.541 --> 18:55.974
Of course.

18:59.021 --> 19:01.981
I just don't get it.
Why am I attracted to men like him?

19:02.016 --> 19:04.581
You believe in redemption,
don't you?

19:04.616 --> 19:06.173
Catholics, I mean.

19:08.021 --> 19:11.261
Yeah, we do. Why?
What are you - anything?

19:11.296 --> 19:12.819
Baptist. Was.

19:14.061 --> 19:17.815
I keep wondering if it's possible
to change myself, my life.

19:19.581 --> 19:21.241
How does it work?

19:21.276 --> 19:22.866
What, redemption?

19:22.901 --> 19:25.861
Confess your sins, you ask for
forgiveness and you clean the slate.

19:25.896 --> 19:26.986
That's it.

19:27.021 --> 19:28.906
No matter what you've done?

19:28.941 --> 19:32.251
Provided you repent.
That's the catch.

19:34.901 --> 19:37.021
Sounds too good to be true.

19:37.056 --> 19:38.818
Fuck, I hope not.

19:42.581 --> 19:44.936
I could do with a hug.

19:58.261 --> 20:01.856
When I started, I couldn't stop.

20:04.261 --> 20:08.015
And I started swinging that
piece of wood around like it was...

20:10.381 --> 20:14.461
<i>... you know, like it was a...
like it was a sword,</i>

20:14.496 --> 20:16.452
and I was in a war.

20:18.061 --> 20:22.100
Yeah, I don't know. I just...

20:23.341 --> 20:25.377
I wanted them to bleed.

20:26.501 --> 20:28.332
I wanted to hurt them.

20:29.381 --> 20:31.451
I wanted to leave a mark on them.

20:32.701 --> 20:36.535
I wanted them to remember
the night... they met me.

20:39.781 --> 20:41.226
I dunno.

20:41.261 --> 20:44.026
Does that make me a...

20:44.061 --> 20:47.417
<i>... does that make me a monster,
Father, yeah?</i>

20:49.501 --> 20:52.621
And whose fault is it, you know?

20:52.656 --> 20:56.296
Mine or God's?

21:05.781 --> 21:08.501
When the time came
for their committal hearing,

21:08.536 --> 21:11.221
Jason was still unsure
which way Alphonse would jump.

21:11.256 --> 21:14.850
Would he plead guilty or not guilty?

21:20.861 --> 21:22.746
Why don't you let us sort it out?

21:22.781 --> 21:24.826
They put a dozen people
in hospital, Graham.

21:24.861 --> 21:28.541
Yes, I think it's the Empire's turn
to strike back this time, Graham.

21:28.576 --> 21:30.771
Don't say I didn't offer.

21:36.261 --> 21:39.666
Nicola. Good to see you.

21:39.701 --> 21:42.186
All greased up and ready to go.

21:42.221 --> 21:44.981
You realise it's not
gonna be easy giving evidence?

21:45.016 --> 21:46.906
Look, you'll be fine.

21:46.941 --> 21:50.941
The magistrate just needs to hear
your story in your own words, OK?

21:50.976 --> 21:54.138
So how many other witnesses
have shown up?

22:40.661 --> 22:41.706
Hello?

22:41.741 --> 22:44.778
Oh, yeah, no, it's OK. Um...

22:46.061 --> 22:49.021
Oh, well, look, I'll just have to
check the timetable.

22:49.056 --> 22:50.773
Hang on, I'll go to my office.

23:04.141 --> 23:06.735
Shh!

23:10.301 --> 23:12.106
This had better be good, sunshine.

23:12.141 --> 23:15.258
It's a gift, Tony.
It's for you. A tribute.

23:16.301 --> 23:20.453
Hello, gorgeous. Come here. Come on!

23:23.461 --> 23:25.706
A dog? Who said I wanted a dog?

23:25.741 --> 23:28.241
Not just any dog.
This is Jason's dog.

23:28.276 --> 23:30.706
You pinched
Jason Moran's dog for me?

23:30.741 --> 23:34.381
Mate, he loves this bloody animal
more than he loves his bloody kids.

23:34.416 --> 23:38.613
Is that right? So what's his name?
Moet.

23:40.341 --> 23:42.306
What if I don't like dogs, Carl?

23:42.341 --> 23:44.341
We'll put him down.
Just say the word.

23:44.376 --> 23:46.341
That's your big plan to impress me?

23:46.376 --> 23:48.306
Plan B, actually.

23:48.341 --> 23:50.696
That's only if you don't
really like him.

23:51.741 --> 23:53.811
I think you'd better
come and tell me plan A.

23:56.261 --> 23:58.901
Despite the best advice
from his closest allies,

23:58.936 --> 24:01.186
Alphonse did plead guilty that day

24:01.221 --> 24:04.781
and he effectively severed the bond
with the closest of them all -

24:04.816 --> 24:08.615
Jason Moran, his brother in arms.

24:09.661 --> 24:11.106
So what happens now?

24:11.141 --> 24:13.261
Well, Alphonse goes straight to
a sentencing hearing.

24:13.296 --> 24:16.181
Jason's committal resumes Monday.

24:16.216 --> 24:17.506
So I come back then?

24:17.541 --> 24:20.541
We are gonna have to slug it out
after all, unfortunately.

24:20.576 --> 24:23.861
I wouldn't mind slugging him.
Ugly little rodent.

24:23.896 --> 24:25.746
Yeah, I know.

24:25.781 --> 24:27.851
You have a good weekend.
Yeah.

24:29.421 --> 24:33.061
Without CCTV footage,
without physical evidence,

24:33.096 --> 24:35.370
the entire Crown case
depended on witnesses.

24:36.421 --> 24:40.050
And one by one,
they were persuaded not to testify.

25:09.261 --> 25:11.821
You have a nice day, Nicola.

25:17.381 --> 25:19.906
I need my bloody head read.

25:19.941 --> 25:23.941
What sort of a dimbo gets involved
with two married gangsters?

25:23.976 --> 25:28.651
Hey, hey -
one gangster, one ex-gangster.

25:29.701 --> 25:31.586
You're serious?

25:31.621 --> 25:35.901
Yeah. Yeah, I don't want to finish up
in some shoot-out, you know?

25:35.936 --> 25:38.210
I want to see
my daughters growing up.

25:44.021 --> 25:46.441
What are you gonna do for a crust?

25:46.476 --> 25:48.861
Tommy! What are you doing home?

25:48.896 --> 25:51.678
Anna had to score a deal.

25:51.713 --> 25:54.426
Anna's his sitter. Ex-sitter.

25:54.461 --> 25:56.916
Sweetheart, this is Al.
He's a friend of mine.

25:56.951 --> 25:59.371
Let's go see what's
in the cookie tin, hey?

26:04.261 --> 26:06.821
Fuck. Fuck.

26:12.421 --> 26:14.173
Hello?

26:24.581 --> 26:26.572
Hey, Mark.

26:27.861 --> 26:29.772
What's up?

26:30.821 --> 26:33.540
Isn't this Tracey Seymour's place?

26:35.581 --> 26:37.333
Yeah.

26:38.381 --> 26:39.973
Hi, Mark.

26:41.901 --> 26:43.541
Oh, God, is it Jason?

26:43.576 --> 26:45.099
No, he's fine.

26:47.501 --> 26:49.341
You wanna come in?

26:49.376 --> 26:50.426
No.

26:50.461 --> 26:51.906
I just came to tell you

26:51.941 --> 26:53.786
that he's trying to get
his life back together -

26:53.821 --> 26:56.840
Jason, we're talking about -
and there's no room for you.

26:56.875 --> 26:59.860
But it looks like you've
already moved on, doesn't it?

27:06.861 --> 27:09.986
You gotta try the veal.

27:10.021 --> 27:11.941
Hey? You're always
recommending the veal.

27:11.976 --> 27:13.698
That's because
the veal is excellent.

27:13.733 --> 27:15.386
Yeah, thanks,
but I'm a little dyspeptic.

27:15.421 --> 27:18.781
Oh, Jude reckons I should
avoid cream-based sauces,

27:18.816 --> 27:20.866
so I'll have the Caprese salad
and a beer.

27:20.901 --> 27:24.981
"Your Worship,
my heart is full of remorse."

27:25.016 --> 27:26.866
The guy's a bloody actor!

27:26.901 --> 27:28.941
Hey, Mario,
what's the name of that play?

27:28.976 --> 27:30.746
'Amleto'.

27:30.781 --> 27:33.375
Hamlet! Prince of Denmark.
Yeah, Hamlet.

27:35.341 --> 27:37.536
Oi.

27:40.021 --> 27:41.026
What?

27:41.061 --> 27:44.461
Alphonse is slipping
your girlfriend the length.

27:44.496 --> 27:47.826
Tracey? Bullshit.
She can't get enough of me.

27:47.861 --> 27:49.658
Well, she can't get enough of
the Mediterranean either.

27:50.701 --> 27:53.181
How long have I been warning you
about this prick, hey?

27:53.216 --> 27:54.746
Once bitten, twice shy.

27:54.781 --> 27:57.249
How many times
you been bitten now, brother?

28:08.141 --> 28:09.906
Mark Moran called.

28:09.941 --> 28:12.541
He says you're sleeping with
a lingerie waitress.

28:12.576 --> 28:14.850
True or false?

28:20.341 --> 28:21.774
Fuck off!

28:25.021 --> 28:30.901
"If you want your dog back
in one piece, it will cost you $10,000.

28:30.936 --> 28:36.261
"Wait by the phone for instructions.
Do not tell Jase."

28:36.296 --> 28:37.986
It was stuffed in the letterbox.

28:38.021 --> 28:41.093
Neighbourhood kids, going by
the crap spelling and punctuation.

28:42.941 --> 28:45.741
10 grand's a shitload for a dog.
They must be serious.

28:45.776 --> 28:48.718
What do I do, Cliff?
Carl.

28:48.753 --> 28:51.661
Um, you gotta tell Jase.

28:51.696 --> 28:52.626
Oh, no.

28:52.661 --> 28:55.581
He'll hunt the little bastards down
and rip their hearts out.

28:55.616 --> 28:59.266
Well, um, maybe call the cops.
He'll rip MY heart out.

28:59.301 --> 29:03.781
You want me to have a sniff around,
maybe see if I can track 'em down?

29:03.816 --> 29:05.626
Would you?
Oh, yeah, yeah.

29:05.661 --> 29:07.106
Well, you gotta pay 'em something.

29:07.141 --> 29:09.018
How much you got
stashed around in the house?

29:19.381 --> 29:21.266
Oh, yeah, this'll do.

29:21.301 --> 29:24.861
Yeah. Um, alright,
I'll give you a call.

29:24.896 --> 29:26.613
$6,300 in change.

29:28.381 --> 29:29.826
That's your plan A?

29:29.861 --> 29:32.421
I take the dog back,
you buy yourself a few new suits.

29:32.456 --> 29:35.266
I don't buy my suits, Carl.

29:35.301 --> 29:38.906
Only one problem with that, Carl.
What's that, Tony?

29:38.941 --> 29:41.821
I think he likes me.
What if I don't wanna give him back?

29:41.856 --> 29:43.812
Ah-ha!

29:46.061 --> 29:48.501
What's he doing, eh?
What's he doing?

29:48.536 --> 29:51.055
Holy shit!
Hey? Hey?

29:51.090 --> 29:53.574
Come here.
There you go.

29:54.901 --> 29:56.971
Hello, puppy.

30:00.981 --> 30:03.370
Stir that through.
The fragrance is good.

30:04.861 --> 30:07.250
What the fuck do you want?

30:18.781 --> 30:20.260
What's this, mate?

30:21.861 --> 30:27.413
Some Indian shit.
I don't know... cauliflower something.

30:33.941 --> 30:36.739
Hey, mate, uh, listen...
What? What?

30:39.781 --> 30:41.612
I'm sorry about Tracey, eh?

30:45.501 --> 30:49.297
It just happened.
Wasn't a planned thing.

30:49.332 --> 30:53.094
It was just...
it was 100% pure accident.

30:57.381 --> 30:59.226
Doesn't matter.

30:59.261 --> 31:02.899
She's a... bloody moll anyway.

31:02.934 --> 31:06.537
Probably too good for both of us.

31:08.661 --> 31:11.539
What the fuck's
the matter with you, Alphonse?

31:24.461 --> 31:26.541
I went to church.

31:26.576 --> 31:28.186
You what?

31:28.221 --> 31:31.106
I had a chat
with the priest, you know?

31:31.141 --> 31:34.461
He helped me see what a fuck-up
I've made of my life, you know?

31:34.496 --> 31:37.221
I can't afford to fuck up anymore.

31:37.256 --> 31:40.019
It's nothing personal.

31:44.021 --> 31:45.977
Get your hands off my dog.

32:17.341 --> 32:20.838
Hey, I, uh... I saw the girl.

32:20.873 --> 32:24.336
It's over, OK? It's all over.

32:25.541 --> 32:27.816
I think I prefer it when you lie.

32:31.741 --> 32:34.096
Everything's gonna be good, OK?

32:37.021 --> 32:39.061
I'm gonna go pick up
the girls from Gail's.

32:39.096 --> 32:41.826
There's a casserole in the oven.

32:41.861 --> 32:46.541
Is there enough for two?
'Cause Graham said he's coming over.

32:46.576 --> 32:48.452
Yeah.

32:51.621 --> 32:53.373
I'm glad you're here.

33:01.941 --> 33:06.810
Everything's gonna be OK, I promise.

33:22.221 --> 33:25.896
You did good... cutting him loose.

33:28.061 --> 33:31.341
I didn't. He cut me.

33:31.376 --> 33:33.506
Prick.

33:33.541 --> 33:35.532
Everything this family's
done for him.

33:37.661 --> 33:40.050
Takes your girl
and treats you like shit.

33:43.781 --> 33:45.533
Want a freshie?

33:57.061 --> 33:58.653
Once bitten.

34:21.940 --> 34:23.386
Al!

34:23.420 --> 34:25.460
Hey, you shouldn't have dressed!

34:25.496 --> 34:27.132
Graham. Come in, mate.

34:28.181 --> 34:30.172
You hungry?
Yeah.

34:31.501 --> 34:34.379
Thanks for the invite, mate.
What's on your mind?

34:39.061 --> 34:43.301
Where's Uncle Jase?
He went out to drive his car.

34:43.335 --> 34:45.895
Shit.

34:55.101 --> 34:58.621
What do you think of me pleading, eh?
Turning over a new leaf?

34:58.656 --> 35:01.701
You could have knocked me down
with a feather.

35:01.736 --> 35:03.626
I just don't want
the girls growing up

35:03.661 --> 35:06.721
thinking their old man was some
sort of cheap hood, you know?

35:06.756 --> 35:09.781
Don't worry. We'll look after Ginny
when you're in the boob.

35:09.816 --> 35:12.146
I appreciate it,

35:12.181 --> 35:17.414
but that's not the way
I plan on financing my future life.

35:19.061 --> 35:22.021
Which is where you come in, Graham -

35:22.056 --> 35:25.156
Australia's
greatest ever safe-breaker.

35:25.191 --> 35:28.257
King of the legendary
Magnetic Drill Gang.

35:35.861 --> 35:38.933
Answer your phone, Jason!
Turn it on! Shit!

36:01.021 --> 36:02.626
How long
you been thinking about this?

36:02.661 --> 36:06.176
A couple of hours.
What do you think?

36:07.661 --> 36:09.094
What do you need me for?

36:10.261 --> 36:13.014
What if the old man doesn't wanna
give up the combination to the safe?

36:16.861 --> 36:20.012
Hey, Jase. What are you doin' here?

36:21.061 --> 36:23.061
Jason, put the bloody gun down!

36:23.096 --> 36:24.016
Jesus!

37:17.981 --> 37:20.141
So long, old mate.

37:20.176 --> 37:22.609
God bless.

37:29.501 --> 37:31.253
Nope.

37:33.781 --> 37:35.533
What about this guy?

37:39.781 --> 37:44.297
What about him?
Yes, that's him. Definitely.

37:48.821 --> 37:50.066
That's good.

37:50.101 --> 37:53.461
And this bloke?
No, I don't think so.

37:53.496 --> 37:56.306
Are you sure?

37:56.341 --> 37:59.617
No, the guy I saw had tats.

38:03.301 --> 38:05.053
Thanks.

38:07.941 --> 38:10.421
I'm still waiting for some bastard
to tell me what happened.

38:10.456 --> 38:12.226
I wanna know WHY it happened.

38:12.261 --> 38:15.061
He was a threat to every one of us.
It was bound to happen...

38:15.096 --> 38:16.661
Somebody killed a friend of mine!

38:16.696 --> 38:18.106
I wanna know why.

38:18.141 --> 38:21.019
I take this as a personal
fuckin' insult. Got it?

38:23.661 --> 38:26.601
He was a loose cannon.
We gave him repeated warnings.

38:26.636 --> 38:29.208
You warned him, Mario,
but he couldn't help himself.

38:29.243 --> 38:31.951
He just had to prove
what a big gangster he was.

38:31.986 --> 38:34.659
I mean, that was what
the guilty plea was all about.

38:36.021 --> 38:38.906
None of this answers my question.

38:38.941 --> 38:41.614
Who cares what happened?
It's not gonna bring him back.

38:45.701 --> 38:48.741
Munster, you got nothing to say?

38:48.776 --> 38:52.195
Well, he was my mate too, Mario.

38:52.230 --> 38:55.615
He just... had a death wish.

39:00.461 --> 39:03.066
May he rest in peace.

39:03.101 --> 39:06.981
Anyway, bottom line is the
witnesses' evidence is fairly useless.

39:07.016 --> 39:10.735
So, therefore, Jason's
gonna get away with murder?

39:11.781 --> 39:14.901
Explain to me why you are
going to Gangitano's funeral.

39:14.936 --> 39:17.701
Because anyone who's anyone
will be there.

39:17.736 --> 39:20.461
It's an intelligence bonanza.

39:20.496 --> 39:21.946
Well, enjoy yourself.

39:21.981 --> 39:24.761
I'm gonna have a shower
and go home.

39:24.796 --> 39:27.541
Well, I thought you'd maybe stay.

39:27.576 --> 39:30.678
Even... permanently.

39:30.713 --> 39:33.746
The reason being?

39:33.781 --> 39:37.376
Well, there's lots of reasons.

40:27.421 --> 40:29.186
Who did it?

40:29.221 --> 40:31.212
Internal affairs, Tony.

40:32.261 --> 40:35.586
Rumour has it
Mark was on the premises.

40:35.621 --> 40:40.137
You don't expect me
to respond to rumours, do you?

40:59.341 --> 41:01.616
Condolences.

41:02.981 --> 41:05.097
My heart is full of sorrow.

41:11.501 --> 41:13.897
The Prince is dead.

41:13.932 --> 41:16.293
Long live the Prince.

41:23.701 --> 41:27.021
The Moran boys thought
the world was theirs for the taking.

41:27.056 --> 41:29.586
But they'd overlooked
a home-grown threat

41:29.621 --> 41:33.011
with the potential to bring law
and order in this town to its knees.

41:37.741 --> 41:39.906
And Carl Williams had just learned

41:39.941 --> 41:42.774
that it was possible
to get away with murder.
