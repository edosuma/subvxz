WEBVTT

00:02.370 --> 00:03.836
IS THERE ANY WAY I COULD
TAKE THIS ON MONDAY?

00:03.836 --> 00:05.005
WHAT ABOUT
AFTER SCHOOL TOMORROW?

00:05.005 --> 00:06.939
I CAN'T. I HAVE
COMMUNITY SERVICE.

00:06.939 --> 00:08.509
IT'S A COMMUNITY
CRISIS HOTLINE.

00:08.509 --> 00:11.445
THIS IS A TRANSCRIPT OF A CALL
THAT CAME IN LAST NIGHT.

00:11.445 --> 00:12.746
"I ALMOST
GOT CAUGHT TONIGHT.

00:12.746 --> 00:14.348
"IT'S GONE
AND I CAN'T GET IT BACK.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.849
I MIGHT AS WELL BE DEAD"?

00:15.849 --> 00:18.919
I NEVER WANTED TO HURT ANYBODY,
 BUT NOW I HAVE TO.

00:18.919 --> 00:20.221
HELLO.
 EZRA.

00:20.221 --> 00:21.655
I REALLY NEEDED TO HEAR YOUR--
 I KNOW.

00:21.655 --> 00:24.225
BUT YOU CAN'T CALL
HERE ANYMORE.

00:24.225 --> 00:25.726
OH, MY GOD,
THAT'S AWESOME!

00:25.726 --> 00:27.695
SURPRISE PARTY
AT THE LAKE HOUSE.
I JUST NEED YOUR HELP.

00:27.695 --> 00:30.398
CALEB'S PROBABLY NEVER EVEN
HAD A BIRTHDAY PARTY BEFORE.

00:30.398 --> 00:32.299
I DON'T KNOW
THIS EMILY.

00:32.299 --> 00:33.567
I THINK YOU'LL
LIKE HER.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.869
I WANT TO MAKE SURE
SHE STILL LIKES ME.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.106
HEY.
WE THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WERE STILL OVERSEAS.

00:38.106 --> 00:39.940
OH, YEAH, WE JUST
GOT BACK LAST WEEK.

00:39.940 --> 00:41.509
HOLDEN!
LOOK WHO'S HERE?

00:41.509 --> 00:43.811
HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?
GOOD.

00:43.811 --> 00:46.180
PLEASE DON'T DO SOMETHING
YOU'RE GONNA REGRET, LUCAS.

00:46.180 --> 00:48.015
HANNA!
DO NOT ANSWER THAT.

00:48.015 --> 00:49.817
FORGET THE FIREWORKS.
FORGET EVERYTHING!

00:49.817 --> 00:52.420
THIS IS NOT ABOUT
THE STUPID FIREWORKS, HANNA!

00:52.420 --> 00:54.522
AAH!

00:54.522 --> 00:57.891
( struggling )

00:57.891 --> 00:59.293
AAH!

00:59.293 --> 01:02.730
WHERE'S LUCAS?
IS HE STILL OUT THERE?

01:04.397 --> 01:10.504
* HOW'D IT FEEL TO GET
 IT OFF OF YOUR CHEST *

01:10.504 --> 01:14.408
* WAS IT BURNING DEEP
 WITHIN YOU... *

01:14.408 --> 01:18.011
HERE'S SOME ASPIRIN.

01:18.011 --> 01:20.548
YOU WANT ME TO MAKE
YOU SOME SOUP?

01:20.548 --> 01:23.717
THANKS, BUT I'M
NOT HUNGRY.

01:23.717 --> 01:25.986
YOU WANT A BLANKET?

01:25.986 --> 01:27.721
SURE.

01:27.721 --> 01:29.190
HERE'S YOUR BAG.

01:29.190 --> 01:31.825
I THINK CALEB CALLED.
YOUR PHONE WAS MAKING NOISE.

01:31.825 --> 01:35.863
HAN? NOW, I KNOW
THAT YOU MIGHT NOT BE READY
TO TALK ABOUT THIS,

01:35.863 --> 01:38.566
BUT THE SHERIFF SAID
THAT THEY'RE GONNA DRAG

01:38.566 --> 01:40.568
THE LAKE FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING.

01:40.568 --> 01:42.936
LUCAS ISN'T
IN THE LAKE.

01:42.936 --> 01:46.474
HE DIDN'T COME
UP TO SHORE.

01:46.474 --> 01:47.675
WE WAITED.

01:47.675 --> 01:49.710
HE KNOWS HOW TO SWIM,
ALL RIGHT?

01:52.045 --> 01:54.915
HE'S OUT THERE SOMEWHERE.

01:54.915 --> 01:56.484
I CAN FEEL IT.

01:57.785 --> 02:01.822
I-I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT LUCAS WOULD HELP "A."

02:01.822 --> 02:05.193
WHY NOT? JENNA DID
THE SAME THING WITH CALEB.

02:05.193 --> 02:07.461
"A" KNOWS LUCAS
IS CLOSE TO HANNA.

02:07.461 --> 02:10.830
NO, I-I GET IT,
I JUST... DON'T

02:10.830 --> 02:14.768
REALLY SEE LUCAS AS
BEING THAT VIOLENT.

02:14.768 --> 02:16.637
HE CAN BE.

02:16.637 --> 02:22.243
LUCAS WAS THE ONE WHO DESTROYED
ALISON'S MEMORIAL.

02:23.944 --> 02:26.314
I FOUND OUT THE NIGHT
I GOT OUT OF THE HOSPITAL.

02:26.314 --> 02:27.448
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US?

02:27.448 --> 02:29.149
TOLD ME TO KEEP A SECRET.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.351
WHY?

02:30.351 --> 02:33.053
TO PROTECT HIM.

02:33.053 --> 02:35.923
HE'S BEEN THROUGH
A LOT.

02:35.923 --> 02:37.758
ALISON REALLY
TORTURED HIM.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.960
MAYBE IT'S TIME
TO START PROTECTING YOU.

02:39.960 --> 02:42.230
I HAVE A HEADACHE.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.069
HANNA, DON'T DRINK THAT!

02:49.069 --> 02:50.571
Aria: THAT'S
LAKE WATER.

02:50.571 --> 02:51.572
TOO LATE.

02:51.572 --> 02:53.073
HOW DID THAT
GET IN THERE?

02:53.073 --> 02:55.042
THE BAG WAS OUTSIDE
IN THE CAR.

02:55.042 --> 02:56.244
BUT ALL OF US
WERE IN HERE.

02:56.244 --> 02:57.545
YEAH, LUCAS WASN'T.

02:57.545 --> 02:59.880
MAYBE HE JUST WANTS
TO FINISH WHAT HE STARTED.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.549
( cell phone dings )

03:03.851 --> 03:06.587
NO FUN CHUGGING LAKE WATER,
IS IT?

03:06.587 --> 03:09.457
CHOKE ON THIS, BITCH.
"A."

03:12.226 --> 03:14.895
( thunder rumbling )

03:17.265 --> 03:19.667
* GOT A SECRET,
 CAN YOU KEEP IT *

03:19.667 --> 03:21.802
* SWEAR THIS ONE
 YOU'LL SAVE *

03:21.802 --> 03:24.405
* BETTER LOCK IT
 IN YOUR POCKET *

03:24.405 --> 03:26.940
* TAKIN' THIS ONE
 TO THE GRAVE *

03:26.940 --> 03:29.710
* IF I SHOW YOU
 THEN I KNOW YOU *

03:29.710 --> 03:32.012
* WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID *

03:32.012 --> 03:37.217
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN KEEP A SECRET
 IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD *

03:40.087 --> 03:42.456
OKAY, THANKS.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.792
LUCAS CALLED
HIS PARENTS TODAY.

03:46.294 --> 03:48.462
AND HE'S STILL NOT HOME?

03:48.462 --> 03:50.030
( sighs ) THEY MUST BE
GOING OUT OF THEIR MINDS.

03:50.030 --> 03:52.600
DID HE SAY WHERE HE IS,
WHERE HE'S BEEN?

03:54.335 --> 03:56.036
WAS THERE DRINKING
AT THIS PARTY?

03:56.036 --> 03:57.571
NO.

04:00.040 --> 04:03.977
DID HE ARGUE
WITH SOMEONE? HANNA!

04:03.977 --> 04:06.414
I DON'T KNOW.

04:06.414 --> 04:07.781
I SHOULD CALL THEM.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.116
CAN YOU GIVE ME
THEIR HOME NUMBER?

04:09.116 --> 04:10.217
NO, WHY DO YOU
HAVE TO CALL THEM?

04:10.217 --> 04:12.320
BECAUSE MY DAUGHTER
HOSTED A PARTY

04:12.320 --> 04:14.622
THAT THEIR SON HAS YET
TO RETURN FROM.

04:14.622 --> 04:17.991
I SHOULD AT LEAST TAKE
SOME RESPONSIBILITY FOR THAT.

04:17.991 --> 04:19.993
LOOK, I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET
AND FRUSTRATED

04:19.993 --> 04:21.995
THAT YOUR FRIEND
IS GOING THROUGH SOMETHING

04:21.995 --> 04:25.399
AND HE RAN OFF INSTEAD
OF TURNING TO YOU FOR HELP.

04:25.399 --> 04:28.001
I'M SURE WHEN HE'S READY
LUCAS WILL TELL YOU
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH HIM.

04:29.603 --> 04:32.239
UH, WE SHOULD GO
TO SPENCER'S.

04:32.239 --> 04:34.642
AREN'T YOU GONNA
SEE HER AT SCHOOL?

04:34.642 --> 04:35.776
WE HAVE A GROUP PRESENTATION,

04:35.776 --> 04:37.478
AND WE NEED TO RUN IT
ONE MORE TIME.

04:45.353 --> 04:48.389
"A" WAS DEFINITELY
IN MY LAKE HOUSE.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.257
YOU FOUND THESE
IN THE ATTIC?

04:50.257 --> 04:52.626
THE PICTURE CALEB DECRYPTED
OFF "A" CELL PHONE OF THE DOLLS,

04:52.626 --> 04:54.362
THAT WAS TAKEN
AT THE LAKE HOUSE.

04:54.362 --> 04:55.796
LOOKS LIKE "A"
GOT PRETTY COZY.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.165
WELL, MY FAMILY NEVER USES
THAT HOUSE AFTER LABOR DAY.

04:58.165 --> 05:00.768
IT'S THE PERFECT PLACE
TO SET UP AN EVIL LAIR.

05:00.768 --> 05:03.971
AND LOOK. JUST LOOK
AT THE DATE ON THIS.

05:03.971 --> 05:07.508
WAIT, THAT'S AROUND THE TIME
CALEB AND I WENT UP THERE.

05:07.508 --> 05:12.446
"A" WAS IN THE LAKE HOUSE
WHEN CALEB AND I WERE...

05:12.446 --> 05:14.648
"FRATERNIZING"
ON MY NANA'S SOFA.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.784
OKAY, WHO TOLD?
IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER.

05:16.784 --> 05:18.118
THERE ARE, LIKE,
FOUR BEDROOMS UP THERE

05:18.118 --> 05:19.387
WITH ACTUAL BEDS
IN THEM.

05:19.387 --> 05:21.021
DID YOU GUYS SEE ANYBODY,
HEAR ANYTHING?

05:21.021 --> 05:22.390
EM, WE WERE
KIND OF BUSY.

05:22.390 --> 05:24.257
YEAH, YOU WERE
GETTIN' BUSY.

05:24.257 --> 05:26.660
OKAY, SO, WAIT.
YOU SAID THAT LUCAS WENT

05:26.660 --> 05:28.996
UP IN THE ATTIC LIKE
HE KNEW HIS WAY AROUND?

05:28.996 --> 05:30.364
HE WAS PROBABLY TRYING
TO CLEAN UP

05:30.364 --> 05:31.865
AFTER GARRETT AND JENNA.

05:31.865 --> 05:32.733
AND LOOK.

05:32.733 --> 05:34.067
THERE'S AN ADDRESS.

05:34.067 --> 05:36.537
SMITTY'S.
801 HYPERION STREET.

05:36.537 --> 05:39.339
WAIT, SMITTY'S WHAT?
RESTAURANT? BAR?

05:39.339 --> 05:42.576
HYPERION STREET.
ISN'T THAT IN PHILLY?

05:42.576 --> 05:44.945
DO YOU GUYS WANT TO GO
AFTER SCHOOL TO CHECK IT OUT?

05:46.680 --> 05:49.483
OKAY. YEAH. IF IT MEANS
YOU'RE NOT GOING ALONE,

05:49.483 --> 05:51.351
THEN COUNT ME IN.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.554
IS IT OKAY IF I PASS?

05:53.554 --> 05:56.657
I STILL HAVE THE TASTE
OF LAKE WATER IN MY MOUTH.

06:03.664 --> 06:05.833
I COULD'VE SWORN
THAT MY MOM CAUGHT ME.

06:05.833 --> 06:08.669
TOLD HER I WAS MAKING
A DATE WITH HOLDEN.

06:08.669 --> 06:11.772
HOLDEN STRAUSS?
I THOUGHT HE WAS IN PORTUGAL.

06:11.772 --> 06:14.442
WH- AND WHY WERE YOU CALLING
EZRA FROM YOUR OWN PHONE?

06:14.442 --> 06:15.876
BECAUSE I COULDN'T THINK
OF A GOOD EXCUSE

06:15.876 --> 06:18.111
TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE
AND USE YOURS.

06:18.111 --> 06:20.581
NOT THAT IT REALLY MATTERS.
EZRA'S STOPPED ANSWERING.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.851
DAD THREATENED TO TURN
HIM INTO THE POLICE.

06:23.851 --> 06:25.619
WHAT? ARIA,
I'M SO SORRY.

06:25.619 --> 06:26.887
I THOUGHT
THAT MY PARENTS

06:26.887 --> 06:28.989
WOULD UNDERSTAND,
OR AT LEAST TRY.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.592
THEY BOTH KNOW HOW GREAT
OF A GUY-- HEY, HOLDEN.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.861
HEY, ARIA. SPENCER,
HEY, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

06:33.861 --> 06:35.829
YEAH, HOW WAS
YOUR YEAR ABROAD?

06:35.829 --> 06:39.500
UH, MY DAD WAS STUDYING ALGAE
IN A RIVER DELTA.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.669
I SPENT A LOT OF TIME
IN HIP WADERS,

06:41.669 --> 06:43.904
WHICH WAS... REALLY LAME.

06:43.904 --> 06:46.574
ANYWAY, SO, UH,
I WAS WONDERING

06:46.574 --> 06:48.576
IF YOU WANTED
TO GO OUT TONIGHT.

06:48.576 --> 06:51.144
OH. ( chuckles )

06:51.144 --> 06:54.882
I-I CAN'T.
BUT THANKS.

06:54.882 --> 06:57.150
IT'S JUST THAT
I'M GROUNDED.

06:57.150 --> 07:00.120
REALLY? YOUR DAD SAID
IT WOULDN'T BE A PROBLEM.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.922
OH, OUR PARENTS
TALKED?

07:01.922 --> 07:03.891
DID MY MOM CALL
TO SET US UP?

07:03.891 --> 07:06.026
NO, I-I CALLED
TO ASK PERMISSION.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.795
WHAT? WHO EVEN DOES
THAT ANYMORE?

07:07.795 --> 07:09.997
MY PARENTS HAVE BEEN
PUSHING THIS WHOLE

07:09.997 --> 07:12.500
"RETURN TO KINDER,
GENTLER TRADITIONS" AGENDA.

07:12.500 --> 07:13.667
NO, I'M NOT SAYING
THAT IT'S--

07:13.667 --> 07:15.435
LAUGH NOW, BUT I'LL
BE SENDING YOU

07:15.435 --> 07:18.271
A HANDWRITTEN THANK-YOU NOTE
FOR LETTING ME INTERRUPT
YOUR CONVERSATION.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.507
I'M JUST KIND
OF CONFUSED.

07:19.507 --> 07:21.074
IS THIS A DATE?

07:21.074 --> 07:23.511
IS THAT WEIRD?

07:23.511 --> 07:25.045
NO, UH...

07:25.045 --> 07:27.681
IT'S JUST WE'VE
KNOWN EACH OTHER
SINCE PRESCHOOL.

07:27.681 --> 07:29.316
IS IT THE WHOLE
GLUE THING?

07:29.316 --> 07:32.052
'CAUSE IF I REMEMBER
CORRECTLY, YOU DARED ME.

07:32.052 --> 07:34.622
OKAY, NO, THAT WAS NOT A DARE.
I WAS JUST MISINFORMED.

07:34.622 --> 07:37.290
I THOUGHT THAT IF IT LOOKED
LIKE RANCH DRESSING...

07:37.290 --> 07:40.694
WELL, NOW WE'RE BOTH
OLD ENOUGH TO KNOW
THE DIFFERENCE, SO...

07:40.694 --> 07:44.131
DINNER, A MOVIE?

07:44.131 --> 07:45.666
PASTE-FREE, I PROMISE.

07:45.666 --> 07:48.769
OKAY. YEAH. IT'D BE
GREAT TO HANG OUT.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.871
I'LL THINK OF
SOMETHING FUN TO DO.

07:50.871 --> 07:53.974
GREAT. WHATEVER YOU WANT.
JUST TEXT ME THE DETAILS.

07:53.974 --> 07:57.044
YEAH, WILL DO.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.913
UM, HOW WEIRD
IS THAT?

07:59.913 --> 08:02.850
I USE HIM AS MY ALIBI
AND NOW HE ACTUALLY
WANTS TO GO OUT?

08:02.850 --> 08:05.686
IT'S NOT THAT WEIRD.
HE LIKES YOU.

08:05.686 --> 08:08.388
NO, WE'VE KNOWN
EACH OTHER FOREVER.

08:08.388 --> 08:10.924
YOU'RE CUTE,
AND HE LIKES YOU.

08:10.924 --> 08:13.493
HE SAYS IT WAS
 FOR CHEM LAB,

08:13.493 --> 08:14.895
BUT NOEL WAS ON
THE PHONE WITH SOMEONE

08:14.895 --> 08:16.664
ALL NIGHT AT
CALEB'S BIRTHDAY PARTY.

08:16.664 --> 08:18.732
DID YOU NOTICE HIM
ACTING SKETCHY AT ALL?

08:18.732 --> 08:20.901
I DON'T KNOW.
I WAS KIND OF BUSY
WITH OTHER THINGS.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.335
WHAT, LUCAS?

08:22.335 --> 08:23.637
WHO CARE?

08:23.637 --> 08:25.338
FIRST LUCAS RUINS
CALEB'S BIRTHDAY PARTY.

08:25.338 --> 08:28.576
THEN HE GETS EVERYONE
IN A TIZZY BECAUSE
HE'S PRETEND-MISSING.

08:28.576 --> 08:31.144
NEED ATTENTION MUCH?
HE IS SO LAME.

08:31.144 --> 08:32.312
MONA...

08:32.312 --> 08:33.581
CAN WE VEER
BACK ON TOPIC?

08:33.581 --> 08:34.982
I THINK I'M
LOSING NOEL.

08:34.982 --> 08:36.884
I HAD TO TAKE HIM
SKINNY-DIPPING THAT NIGHT

08:36.884 --> 08:38.686
JUST TO GET
HIS FULL ATTENTION.

08:38.686 --> 08:41.554
THEN WE GOT
INTO THIS HUGE FIGHT
ON THE WAY HOME.

08:43.857 --> 08:44.858
HANNA!

08:44.858 --> 08:47.260
WHERE ARE YOU
TAKING THAT?

08:47.260 --> 08:48.829
STORAGE.

08:48.829 --> 08:52.165
NO, THAT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE HANGING
IN THE SOUTH LOBBY.

08:52.165 --> 08:54.702
THE PRINCIPAL SAID
TO TAKE IT DOWN.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.837
YOU DIDN'T HEAR THIS
FROM ME,

08:56.837 --> 08:58.872
BUT THE ADMINISTRATION
DOESN'T THINK TIARAS

08:58.872 --> 09:01.108
AND ORANGE JUMPSUITS
ARE A GOOD FIT.

09:01.108 --> 09:03.611
SHE'S NOT GIVING UP
THE CROWN!

09:03.611 --> 09:05.913
SO, WHAT
DO YOU THINK?

09:05.913 --> 09:07.815
AM I JUST
BEING PARANOID?

09:07.815 --> 09:10.050
HANNA, ARE YOU EVEN
LISTENING TO ME?

09:10.050 --> 09:12.720
YEAH. YEAH, SURE.
WHAT DID I JUST SAY?

09:12.720 --> 09:15.088
YOU CAN'T EVEN
TELL ME, CAN YOU?

09:15.088 --> 09:17.891
I LISTEN TO EVERY
DRAWN-OUT WHINY DETAIL

09:17.891 --> 09:19.192
WHEN YOU HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH CALEB,

09:19.192 --> 09:20.828
AND YOU CAN'T EVEN
BOTHER TO NOD YOUR HEAD

09:20.828 --> 09:22.262
AND PRETEND
LIKE YOU CARE!

09:22.262 --> 09:26.199
I'M SORRY! OKAY, I HAVE
A LOT GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.567
SO DO I.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.569
I JUST POURED
MY HEART OUT TO SOMEONE

09:29.569 --> 09:33.406
WHO CARES MORE ABOUT
HER HOMECOMING PHOTO
THAN HER FRIEND.

09:33.406 --> 09:37.077
COULD YOU BE
ANY MORE SELFISH?

09:59.566 --> 10:01.134
( thud )

10:06.573 --> 10:09.209
( footsteps )

10:16.817 --> 10:19.119
( phone ringing )

10:20.287 --> 10:21.689
HELLO?

10:21.689 --> 10:23.423
I HAVE A PROBLEM.

10:23.423 --> 10:25.092
WHO'S CALLING.

10:25.092 --> 10:27.060
YOU WORK
 FOR THE CRISIS LINE.

10:27.060 --> 10:29.062
DON'T I GET
 TO STAY ANONYMOUS?

10:29.062 --> 10:31.098
UH, THIS IS
A PRIVATE NUMBER.

10:31.098 --> 10:35.635
PRIVATE? SO, I CAN SAY
 ANYTHING I WANT,

10:35.635 --> 10:38.605
EVEN SOMETHING...
DIRTY?

10:38.605 --> 10:42.342
MAYA?

10:42.342 --> 10:44.377
INAPPROPRIATE, I KNOW.

10:44.377 --> 10:45.478
( laughs )
OH.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.414
WELL?

10:47.414 --> 10:48.882
AREN'T YOU GONNA SAY IT?

10:48.882 --> 10:51.985
SAY WHAT?
SOMETHING DIRTY.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.421
I'D RATHER WHISPER IT
IN YOUR EAR TONIGHT.

10:54.421 --> 10:57.758
WE'RE STILL ON TO SEE
THAT BAND YOU LIKE, RIGHT?

10:57.758 --> 10:59.259
SURE THING. WE JUST--
( beep)

10:59.259 --> 11:04.832
OH, HOLD ON A SECOND.
SOMEONE'S ON THE OTHER LINE.

11:04.832 --> 11:06.633
DO YOU HAVE
TO TAKE IT?

11:06.633 --> 11:08.101
IT CAN GO TO VOICEMAIL.

11:08.101 --> 11:11.471
LISTEN, YOU DON'T HAVE
A FAKE I.D., DO YOU?

11:11.471 --> 11:13.707
I NEVER USE IT, BUT YEAH.

11:13.707 --> 11:15.508
DO YOU HAVE TWO?

11:15.508 --> 11:17.144
MY PARENTS RANSACKED MY ROOM

11:17.144 --> 11:19.379
AFTER I GOT SHIPPED OFF
TO SOBER CAMP.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.214
GUESS WHAT THEY FOUND.

11:21.214 --> 11:22.983
I THINK I CAN
GET YOU ONE.

11:22.983 --> 11:25.185
THAT WAS...
 EASIER THAN I THOUGHT.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.287
ANYTHING ELSE I CAN
HELP YOU WITH?

11:27.287 --> 11:31.324
NOPE. I GET TO SEE
MY GIRL TONIGHT.

11:31.324 --> 11:33.293
PROBLEM SOLVED.

11:33.293 --> 11:35.829
( deeper voice )
SEE YOU LATER.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.172
HELLO?

11:59.652 --> 12:01.922
( thud )

12:14.802 --> 12:16.236
( cell phone dings )

12:34.955 --> 12:37.490
HEY. SO, AS SOON
AS I DOWNLOAD

12:37.490 --> 12:40.593
THIS TRAIN SCHEDULE,
WE'LL BE GOOD TO GO.

12:40.593 --> 12:44.164
UGH. WORST RECEPTION
OUT HERE.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.367
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:47.367 --> 12:51.338
OH, BUYING TICKETS
TO THE RANGELY PLAYHOUSE.

12:51.338 --> 12:53.406
WEREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO GO THERE WITH EZRA?

12:53.406 --> 12:56.209
WAIT, HOW ARE YOU
GETTING BETTER SERVICE
THAN I AM?

12:56.209 --> 13:00.247
WAIT, SWITCH PLACES.
COME ON.

13:03.116 --> 13:06.319
YEAH, WELL, NOW I'M
GOING WITH HOLDEN.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.355
WHAT HAPPENS
IF EZRA'S THERE.

13:08.355 --> 13:09.823
THAT'S THE POINT.

13:09.823 --> 13:12.692
EZRA BOUGHT HIS TICKETS,
LIKE, TWO MONTHS AGO,

13:12.692 --> 13:14.261
AND HE LOVES
ARTHUR MILLER,

13:14.261 --> 13:16.163
SO I'M PRETTY SURE HE'S
LOOKING FORWARD TO IT...

13:16.163 --> 13:19.132
HOLDEN SAID
THAT WE COULD DO
WHATEVER I WANTED.

13:19.132 --> 13:22.069
RIGHT. SO, IF EZRA
JUST HAPPENS TO BE THERE

13:22.069 --> 13:24.037
AND YOU HAPPEN
TO SEE HIM...

13:24.037 --> 13:26.907
AND MAYBE WE HAVE
FATE ON OUR SIDE.

13:28.441 --> 13:31.544
I JUST WISH I DIDN'T
HAVE TO USE HOLDEN
TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

13:31.544 --> 13:33.380
UGH!

13:33.380 --> 13:35.048
OH, COME--

13:35.048 --> 13:36.316
YOU'RE NOT--

13:36.316 --> 13:37.918
NEXT TRAIN IS
IN 20 MINUTES.

13:37.918 --> 13:40.220
WE SHOULD
PROBABLY GET GOING.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.155
WHAT?

13:47.027 --> 13:48.896
LUCAS CALLED AGAIN
THIS MORNING

13:48.896 --> 13:50.497
BEFORE I LEFT
FOR SCHOOL.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.365
MAN, STAYING THERE
THE LAST COUPLE DAYS

13:52.365 --> 13:53.766
HAS BEEN SO AWKWARD!

13:53.766 --> 13:54.935
DID YOU TALK TO HIM?

13:54.935 --> 13:56.236
HIS PARENTS SAID
HE DIDN'T WANT

13:56.236 --> 13:57.938
TO TALK TO ME,
OR THAT HE WOULDN'T.

13:57.938 --> 14:00.073
I THINK WE SHOULD JUST
GO LOOK FOR HIM.

14:00.073 --> 14:01.374
DID THEY TELL YOU
WHERE HE IS?

14:01.374 --> 14:03.476
STAYING AT
HIS COUSIN'S HOUSE.

14:03.476 --> 14:04.878
SAID HE DIDN'T WANT
TO COME HOME,

14:04.878 --> 14:06.546
THAT HE HAD SOMETHING
TO WORK OUT.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.115
SO I CALLED HIS COUSIN.

14:08.115 --> 14:10.650
IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS THE
GUY'S COVERING FOR HIM.

14:10.650 --> 14:12.052
I KNOW A LIE
WHEN I HEAR ONE.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.520
LUCAS DEFINITELY
ISN'T THERE.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.156
WELL, THERE'S NOT MANY
PLACES HE'D GO, RIGHT?

14:16.156 --> 14:19.059
I MEAN, FOR ALL WE KNOW,
HE COULD BE BACK IN ROSEWOOD.

14:19.059 --> 14:20.627
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?
HAVE YOU HEARD FROM HIM?

14:20.627 --> 14:22.795
NO.

14:22.795 --> 14:24.297
I WAS THINKING
ABOUT CHECKING OUT

14:24.297 --> 14:25.832
SPENCER'S
LAKE HOUSE.

14:25.832 --> 14:27.334
YOU KNOW, MAYBE HE
WENT BACK UP THERE.

14:27.334 --> 14:28.902
WHATEVER IT IS THAT
HE'S GOING THROUGH,

14:28.902 --> 14:30.303
I JUST--
I WANT TO HELP.

14:30.303 --> 14:33.106
CALEB, WHEN HE'S READY
TO TALK, HE'LL TALK.

14:33.106 --> 14:35.542
I DON'T KNOW
THAT HE WILL.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.978
LOOK, ARE YOU GONNA
COME WITH ME OR NOT?

14:37.978 --> 14:39.346
I DON'T KNOW, I JUST
DON'T THINK THAT WE

14:39.346 --> 14:41.881
SHOULD GO OUT
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.351
YOU DON'T WANT
TO FIND HIM.

14:46.153 --> 14:47.254
WHY?

14:47.254 --> 14:48.588
I JUST DON'T THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA

14:48.588 --> 14:50.123
TO PUSH HIM RIGHT NOW.

14:50.123 --> 14:52.692
HANNA, WHAT HAPPENED
IN THAT BOAT?

14:52.692 --> 14:53.893
I ALREADY TOLD YOU
WHAT HAPPENED.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.895
NOT THE WHOLE STORY.
THERE IS NO STORY.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.164
YOU'RE NOT BEING
HONEST WITH ME.

14:57.164 --> 14:58.331
ARE YOU CALLING ME
A LIAR?

14:58.331 --> 15:00.367
JUST STOP, OKAY?
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.869
WE HAVE ALWAYS TOLD
EACH OTHER THE TRUTH.

15:02.869 --> 15:04.737
IF YOU WANT TO GO
FIND LUCAS, THEN GO.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.940
NO ONE'S STOPPING YOU.

15:09.542 --> 15:11.111
CALEB...

15:15.815 --> 15:17.084
( beep )

15:28.295 --> 15:30.197
UGH. THIS WOULD BE
SO MUCH EASIER

15:30.197 --> 15:32.465
IF WE ACTUALLY KNEW
WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR.

15:32.465 --> 15:34.667
ARE YOU SURE
THAT WE GOT OFF
AT THE RIGHT STOP?

15:34.667 --> 15:37.437
YEAH. THE MAP SAYS
IT SHOULD BE RIGHT AROUND HERE.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.106
OH.

15:40.673 --> 15:42.675
801 HYPERION.

15:42.675 --> 15:47.447
BUT THIS... CAN'T BE RIGHT.

15:47.447 --> 15:50.017
IT SAYS SMITTY'S
RIGHT ON THE SIGN.

15:50.017 --> 15:52.085
YEAH, 803's RIGHT THERE.

15:52.085 --> 15:54.454
800's ACROSS THE STREET, SO...

15:54.454 --> 15:56.523
WELL, IS THERE
ANYTHING ELSE ON THE RECEIPT

15:56.523 --> 15:58.891
THAT WOULD SAY WHAT "A"
OR ITS HELPER WAS HERE FOR?

15:58.891 --> 16:01.094
NO, IT'S JUST
MAGAZINES.

16:01.094 --> 16:03.630
( sighs )

16:03.630 --> 16:07.134
WELL, THERE'S
A TOY STORE DOWN THE ROAD.

16:07.134 --> 16:10.037
MAYBE "A" SENT LUCAS
DOWN HERE TO PICK UP

16:10.037 --> 16:12.439
THAT FOUR-PACK
OF CHUCKY DOLLS.

16:12.439 --> 16:13.973
YOUR PARENTS WORK
IN THE CITY.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.176
MAYBE THEY JUST STOPPED
HERE FOR SOME GUM
AND MAGAZINES.

16:16.176 --> 16:17.944
YEAH, MAYBE, BUT WHAT
ABOUT THOSE CELL PHONES?

16:17.944 --> 16:20.047
THOSE DIDN'T LOOK LIKE
THEY BELONGED TO MY PARENTS.

16:20.047 --> 16:23.783
WAIT, ISN'T MELISSA'S CONDO,
 LIKE, TEN BLOCKS FROM HERE?

16:23.783 --> 16:26.253
I'M STARTING TO THINK
THIS IS KIND OF A BUST.

16:26.253 --> 16:27.987
DO YOU WANT
TO GRAB A COFFEE?

16:27.987 --> 16:29.256
MM, I CAN'T.

16:29.256 --> 16:33.193
I PROMISED HOLDEN
I'D MEET HIM AT 7:30.

16:33.193 --> 16:35.295
AM I DOING
THE RIGHT THING?

16:35.295 --> 16:37.930
YES! I MEAN,
YOU'RE TAKING A CHANCE,

16:37.930 --> 16:39.799
BUT YOU'RE BEING BOLD
AND ROMANTIC.

16:39.799 --> 16:42.669
YOU CALL ME LATER TO LET ME
KNOW HOW IT TURNS OUT?

16:42.669 --> 16:43.870
I WILL.

16:43.870 --> 16:45.305
OKAY.
OKAY.

16:57.950 --> 17:00.220
( beeping )

17:17.436 --> 17:19.071
THE CALLS COME IN
ON THIS LINE,

17:19.071 --> 17:20.573
AND I LOG
THE NUMBERS HERE.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.775
AND THIS MANUAL HAS
ALL THE EMERGENCY NUMBERS

17:22.775 --> 17:25.044
AND ORGANIZATIONS
THAT WE CAN REFER PEOPLE TO.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.513
I THINK IT'S SO COOL
 THAT YOU'RE HELPING PEOPLE.

17:27.513 --> 17:30.950
THEY'RE LUCKY THEY GET YOU
 ON THE OTHER END OF THE LINE.

17:30.950 --> 17:32.719
I NEED TO RUN HOME
AND CHANGE,

17:32.719 --> 17:34.854
AND WE CAN GRAB DINNER
BEFORE WE GO OUT.

17:34.854 --> 17:36.623
SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.

17:36.623 --> 17:37.657
( ding )

17:38.858 --> 17:40.393
IT'S ME.

17:43.163 --> 17:44.564
EVERYTHING OKAY?

17:44.564 --> 17:46.499
YEAH, YEAH.

17:46.499 --> 17:50.637
ACTUALLY, I'M SORRY, I SORT
OF HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS.

17:50.637 --> 17:52.539
YEAH, NO WORRIES.
I NEED TO GO SIGN OUT.

17:52.539 --> 17:55.041
UM, WOULD IT BE OKAY
IF I CAUGHT UP WITH YOU LATER?

17:55.041 --> 17:56.643
SURE.
OKAY.

17:56.643 --> 18:00.113
I WILL GET DINNER AND MEET
YOU BACK AT YOUR HOUSE.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.995
CAN I HELP YOU?

18:48.995 --> 18:53.200
UM, I'M NOT SURE.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.768
I'VE BEEN AWAY
FOR A FEW YEARS,

18:55.768 --> 18:59.506
AND I WAS JUST TRYING
TO LOCATE A FORMER FRIEND
OF MINE.

18:59.506 --> 19:02.375
SHE WAS A PATIENT HERE.
HER NAME'S JENNA MARSHALL.

19:02.375 --> 19:05.111
PATIENT RECORDS
ARE CONFIDENTIAL.

19:05.111 --> 19:07.013
I DON'T NEED
HER MEDICAL INFORMATION.

19:07.013 --> 19:10.417
I JUST KNOW THAT SHE WENT
TO A SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND
IN PHILADELPHIA,

19:10.417 --> 19:12.685
SO I THOUGHT IT MIGHT
BE THIS ONE.

19:12.685 --> 19:15.755
I CAN'T EVEN TELL YOU
WHICH CHAIR SHE USED
TO SIT IN.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.858
SOMETHING ELSE
I CAN HELP YOU WITH?

19:20.360 --> 19:23.630
NO. I GUESS THAT'S IT.

19:31.738 --> 19:33.540
EXCUSE ME.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.076
YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR JENNA?

19:37.076 --> 19:38.678
I KNOW HER.

19:48.921 --> 19:51.358
HEY, HANNA.

19:51.358 --> 19:53.360
HAVEN'T YOU
WASHED THAT ALREADY?

19:53.360 --> 19:55.027
FOUR TIMES?

19:55.027 --> 19:58.130
YEAH, BUT IT STILL
SMELLS WRETCHED.

19:58.130 --> 19:59.499
WHERE'S MAYA?

19:59.499 --> 20:02.735
SHE'S MEETING ME
LATER... I THINK.

20:03.770 --> 20:05.705
MAYA'S KEEPING
SOMETHING FROM ME.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.574
I MEAN, SHE KEEPS
GETTING THESE CALLS

20:07.574 --> 20:08.808
AND THESE
TEXT MESSAGES,

20:08.808 --> 20:10.877
AND I CAN TELL IT'S
MAKING HER UPSET.

20:10.877 --> 20:13.413
I SHOULD JUST ASK
HER ABOUT IT, RIGHT?

20:13.413 --> 20:15.482
I MEAN, I'M A PART
OF HER LIFE AGAIN.

20:15.482 --> 20:17.183
I SHOULD KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON,
SHOULDN'T I?

20:17.183 --> 20:20.052
GOD, WHY ISN'T ANYONE ALLOWED
TO HAVE A DAMN SECRET?

20:20.052 --> 20:22.121
BECAUSE THE CALLS,
THE TEXTS?

20:22.121 --> 20:23.356
I'M STARTING
TO WORRY

20:23.356 --> 20:24.824
THAT IT'S "A"
GOING AFTER HER.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.693
EM, JUST BECAUSE WE WANT
TO THROW UP

20:26.693 --> 20:28.060
EVERY TIME
OUR PHONE RINGS,

20:28.060 --> 20:29.696
DOESN'T MEAN EVERYONE ELSE
IS LIVING IN FEAR.

20:29.696 --> 20:31.163
YOU THINK
I'M PARANOID?

20:31.163 --> 20:33.032
I THINK THAT MAYA
COULD BE BUGGING UP

20:33.032 --> 20:34.467
FOR A HUNDRED
DIFFERENT REASONS

20:34.467 --> 20:35.935
THAT HAVE NOTHING
TO DO WITH "A."

20:35.935 --> 20:38.104
AND BESIDES, IF SHE IS
KEEPING SOMETHING FROM YOU,

20:38.104 --> 20:39.339
MAYBE IT'S FOR
YOUR OWN GOOD.

20:39.339 --> 20:41.441
OKAY, HANNA, PROMISE
ME THAT YOU NEVER

20:41.441 --> 20:43.476
TAKE A JOB
AT A CRISIS CENTER.

20:43.476 --> 20:45.878
I'M SORRY. IT'S JUST
CALEB AND I GOT IN A FIGHT,

20:45.878 --> 20:47.680
AND I'M JUST TRYING
TO PROTECT HIM.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.650
BUT IT SUCKS BEING
THE GIRLFRIEND
WHO KNOWS TOO MUCH.

20:50.650 --> 20:53.453
YEAH, WELL, IT SUCKS
JUST AS BAD

20:53.453 --> 20:55.855
BEING THE GIRLFRIEND
WHO DOESN'T KNOW ENOUGH.

21:07.133 --> 21:08.835
HERE.

21:10.737 --> 21:12.505
DO YOU LIKE
REAL SUGAR OR FAKE?

21:12.505 --> 21:14.407
REAL. I'LL GET IT.

21:14.407 --> 21:17.143
JUST TELL ME--
TELL ME WHAT TIME IT'S AT.

21:17.143 --> 21:19.479
OH, UH, 11:00.

21:27.854 --> 21:29.121
NEAT TRICK, HUH?

21:29.121 --> 21:31.023
YEAH.

21:32.158 --> 21:33.793
HERE.

21:35.194 --> 21:36.896
FEEL THE DIFFERENCE?

21:36.896 --> 21:40.767
YEAH, THE GRAINS OF SUGAR
ARE BIGGER. HUH.

21:43.636 --> 21:46.506
SO, YOU WENT TO SCHOOL
WITH JENNA IN ROSEWOOD?

21:46.506 --> 21:49.676
UH, NO. I KNEW HER
FROM BEFORE.

21:49.676 --> 21:51.644
WHEN SHE MOVED
TO ROSEWOOD,

21:51.644 --> 21:53.546
WE KIND OF
LOST TOUCH.

21:53.546 --> 21:56.549
YOU AND JENNA GOT HERE
AROUND THE SAME TIME?

21:56.549 --> 21:59.652
I WAS HERE A WHILE
BEFORE JENNA SHOWED UP.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.621
I HAVE A GENETIC CONDITION.

22:01.621 --> 22:04.524
I'VE BEEN GOING BLIND SLOWLY
SINCE I WAS BORN.

22:04.524 --> 22:07.159
LITERALLY
SAW IT COMING.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.862
WHEN THE LIGHTS
WENT OUT,

22:09.862 --> 22:11.598
I WASN'T READY.

22:11.598 --> 22:14.200
I GOT ANGRY,
DEPRESSED.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.536
MEETING JENNA
PULLED ME OUT OF IT.

22:16.536 --> 22:18.070
SHE HELPED YOU?

22:18.070 --> 22:20.407
SHE WAS SO FOCUSED.

22:20.407 --> 22:23.275
NO, DETERMINED.

22:23.275 --> 22:25.277
I THINK SHE LEARNED
MORE IN A YEAR

22:25.277 --> 22:27.880
THAN MOST PEOPLE
LEARN HERE IN FOUR.

22:27.880 --> 22:31.117
I GUESS SHE WAS MOTIVATED
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

22:31.117 --> 22:33.686
FOR, LIKE,
FIELD TRIPS?

22:33.686 --> 22:36.689
IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE IN JAIL.

22:36.689 --> 22:39.025
AND THEY ENCOURAGE US
TO GET OUT ON OUR OWN

22:39.025 --> 22:40.760
AND PRACTICE
OR WHATEVER.

22:40.760 --> 22:43.596
IT'S NICE TO HAVE
A CHANGE OF SCENERY.

22:44.831 --> 22:47.567
IT'S A JOKE, SPENCER!
YOU CAN LAUGH.

22:47.567 --> 22:49.569
NO, I'M SORRY.
UH, I--

22:49.569 --> 22:52.304
I GUESS I WAS
JUST WONDERING
WHERE SHE WENT.

22:52.304 --> 22:53.840
DID SHE EVER
TELL YOU

22:53.840 --> 22:56.375
WHERE SHE WENT
OR WHO SHE MET?

22:56.375 --> 22:58.310
SHE KEPT SAYING
SHE HAD THINGS

22:58.310 --> 23:00.312
SHE HAD TO DO
BACK HOME.

23:00.312 --> 23:02.715
I HAVEN'T TALKED
TO HER IN A WHILE.

23:02.715 --> 23:06.118
WHATEVER IT IS,
I HOPE SHE DID IT.

23:09.255 --> 23:11.257
SO, WHEN DO YOU GET
OUT OF HERE?

23:11.257 --> 23:13.225
OH, I'M DONE
WITH REHAB NOW.

23:13.225 --> 23:16.328
I HELP OUT IN THE ART STUDIO
A COUPLE TIMES A WEEK.

23:16.328 --> 23:18.230
IF JENNA HADN'T DRAGGED
ME IN THERE,

23:18.230 --> 23:20.032
I MIGHT'VE LOST MYSELF.

23:20.032 --> 23:22.001
NOW I HAVE SOME OF WHAT
SHE GAVE ME TO GIVE BACK.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.873
Electronic Voice:
 IT IS 6:14.

23:26.873 --> 23:30.777
THAT WOULD BE
MY NEXT CLASS ABOUT TO START.

23:32.612 --> 23:36.082
UM, IT WAS NICE MEETING YOU.

23:36.082 --> 23:38.485
YEAH, YOU TOO.

23:38.485 --> 23:40.620
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

23:40.620 --> 23:42.555
YOUR PULSE
IS KIND OF RACING.

23:42.555 --> 23:44.724
NO, I JUST DON'T
WANT TO MISS MY TRAIN.

23:44.724 --> 23:47.760
SORRY. THE PULSE THING

23:47.760 --> 23:49.729
IS ANOTHER LITTLE TRICK
JENNA TAUGHT ME.

23:49.729 --> 23:51.931
SHE'S FULL OF SURPRISES,
THAT ONE.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.833
I KNOW.

23:53.833 --> 23:56.836
I THINK THAT'S PART
OF WHAT MAKES HER SO SPECIAL.

23:56.836 --> 23:59.806
SHE'S REALLY GOOD
AT READING PEOPLE.

24:02.174 --> 24:03.576
HAVE A GOOD ONE.

24:03.576 --> 24:05.444
YOU TOO.
THANKS.

24:12.585 --> 24:15.855
HOLD ON, MISS.
YOU NEED TO SIGN IN.

24:15.855 --> 24:17.890
UH, I WAS
JUST LEAVING.

24:17.890 --> 24:21.327
YOU SAT. YOU HAD COFFEE.
THAT MAKES YOU A VISITOR.

24:21.327 --> 24:22.995
WHAT DOES
THAT SIGN SAY?

24:24.396 --> 24:26.499
ALL VISITORS
MUST SIGN IN.

24:26.499 --> 24:30.637
JADA! CAN YOU
COME BACK HERE?

25:02.268 --> 25:03.570
GOOD NIGHT.

25:03.570 --> 25:06.505
YEAH, THANK YOU.
HAVE A GOOD EVENING.

25:10.076 --> 25:11.778
DON'T YOU HAVE
YOUR OWN FAKE I.D.?

25:11.778 --> 25:14.146
WE ALL GOT
NEW ONES TOGETHER.

25:14.146 --> 25:15.682
IT'S FOR MAYA.

25:15.682 --> 25:17.884
I LOOK NOTHING
LIKE MAYA.

25:17.884 --> 25:20.119
YOU'RE 5'2"
AND BRUNETTE.

25:20.119 --> 25:21.554
SO IS SHE.

25:21.554 --> 25:23.923
IT'S THE BEST I CAN DO
ON SHORT NOTICE.

25:23.923 --> 25:26.292
BESIDES, WE'RE GOING TO
THE BLUEBIRD IN CAMDEN.

25:26.292 --> 25:28.961
OH, JERSEY?
YEAH, THAT'LL TOTALLY WORK.

25:28.961 --> 25:31.898
OKAY, SO ALL THE WINDOWS
AND DOORS ARE LOCKED.

25:34.701 --> 25:36.468
YOU CAN STILL
CALL MONA,

25:36.468 --> 25:37.770
SEE IF SHE'LL
SLEEP OVER.

25:37.770 --> 25:39.505
SHE'S MAD
AT ME, TOO.

25:39.505 --> 25:41.007
WELL, MAYBE CALEB
WILL CALM DOWN

25:41.007 --> 25:42.975
AND COME OVER LATER.
HOW BAD WAS YOUR FIGHT?

25:42.975 --> 25:44.977
BAD. HE THINKS LUCAS
NEEDS OUR HELP.

25:44.977 --> 25:47.146
WELL, CALEB WON'T BELIEVE
LUCAS IS DANGEROUS

25:47.146 --> 25:49.515
UNTIL HE KNOWS WHAT LUCAS
DID TO ALI'S MEMORIAL.

25:49.515 --> 25:51.017
YEAH, WELL,
I CAN'T SPILL THAT

25:51.017 --> 25:52.919
WITHOUT, LIKE, SPILLING
A MILLION OTHER BEANS.

25:52.919 --> 25:54.721
MEANWHILE, I'M HOME
ALONE AND LUCAS

25:54.721 --> 25:56.889
IS OUT THERE
WAITING FOR ME.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.092
YOU KNOW WHAT?

26:00.092 --> 26:03.630
I'M JUST GONNA CALL
HOLDEN AND CANCEL.

26:03.630 --> 26:05.765
MAYBE MAYA CAN GO
 WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

26:05.765 --> 26:08.567
NO. NO, MY MOM WILL BE HOME
BEFORE YOU AND MAYA LEAVE,

26:08.567 --> 26:12.271
AND, ARIA, DON'T CANCEL
JUST FOR ME.

26:12.271 --> 26:13.472
YOU SURE?

26:13.472 --> 26:15.007
YEAH.

26:15.007 --> 26:17.376
I'LL BE FINE
IF SOMEONE'S AROUND.

26:17.376 --> 26:18.911
OKAY.

26:20.046 --> 26:22.581
WELL, I SHOULD PROBABLY
GET GOING, THEN.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.784
I'M GONNA GO UPSTAIRS
AND GET CHANGED.

26:24.784 --> 26:27.219
SCREAM IF YOU NEED ME.

26:27.219 --> 26:28.755
YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.

26:33.626 --> 26:35.361
S.O.S., OKAY?

26:35.361 --> 26:36.629
YEAH.

26:57.950 --> 26:59.085
HEY.

26:59.085 --> 27:00.319
HI.

27:00.319 --> 27:01.988
I THOUGHT YOUR PARENTS
WERE DRIVING YOU HERE.

27:01.988 --> 27:04.090
OH, WELL, I CONVINCED
MY MOM TO DROP

27:04.090 --> 27:06.492
ME OFF AT THE CORNER.
IT'S PROGRESS.

27:06.492 --> 27:07.860
SOUNDS TOUGH.

27:07.860 --> 27:09.829
WHAT'D YOU DO TO BRING ON
THE PARENTAL WRATH?

27:09.829 --> 27:13.432
IT'S A REALLY
LONG STORY.

27:13.432 --> 27:14.633
BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING.

27:14.633 --> 27:16.903
OH! GUMMY BEARS?

27:16.903 --> 27:20.572
YEAH, WHEN WE WERE LITTLE
YOU'D ALWAYS SMUGGLE SOME
INTO OUR PLAYDATES.

27:20.572 --> 27:21.874
OH, THAT'S RIGHT!

27:21.874 --> 27:24.010
YEAH, WHEN YOUR MOM WAS
IN HER NO-SUGAR PHASE.

27:24.010 --> 27:25.845
MY MOM'S HAD
A LOT OF PHASES.

27:25.845 --> 27:28.314
ANYWAY, I FIGURED
I OWE YOU.

27:28.314 --> 27:29.716
OH. THANK YOU.

27:29.716 --> 27:32.819
I'M GONNA GO GRAB
THE TICKETS.

27:32.819 --> 27:35.587
HI. TWO
FOR MONTGOMERY.

27:35.587 --> 27:37.724
THANKS.

27:37.724 --> 27:41.894
UM, ARE THERE TWO
FOR FITZ?

27:43.095 --> 27:44.596
OH, NO.
THEY'RE NOT MINE.

27:44.596 --> 27:48.400
I JUST THOUGHT
THAT MY FRIEND WOULD
BE HERE BY NOW.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.668
THANKS.

28:14.827 --> 28:16.796
LOOK WHO I FOUND!

28:16.796 --> 28:19.065
OH, MRS. WELCH. HI.

28:19.065 --> 28:21.667
HI. HEY, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU KIDS WERE
ARTHUR MILLER FANS.

28:21.667 --> 28:24.436
YOU KNOW, VIEW FROM
 THE BRIDGE IS ONE
 OF MY FAVORITES.

28:24.436 --> 28:26.705
WHAT'S IT ABOUT?
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN IT?

28:26.705 --> 28:28.407
OH, I DON'T WANT
TO RUIN IT FOR YOU,

28:28.407 --> 28:33.179
BUT LET'S JUST SAY
IT'S GOT A LOT
OF MISPLACED PASSION.

28:35.882 --> 28:38.851
WELL, WE SHOULD PROBABLY
GO FIND OUR SEATS.

28:38.851 --> 28:43.055
HEY, EZRA, WHEN DID
YOU GET HERE?

28:59.638 --> 29:01.974
( trash can clatters )

29:19.125 --> 29:20.459
SPENCER?

29:20.459 --> 29:21.794
H-HI!

29:21.794 --> 29:24.864
HOW RANDOM! WERE
YOU JUST ON THE TRAIN
IN FROM THE CITY?

29:24.864 --> 29:27.133
YEAH. I DIDN'T
SEE YOU.

29:27.133 --> 29:28.868
I KNOW! WE COULD'VE
SAT TOGETHER.

29:28.868 --> 29:30.769
SO, WHAT TOOK
YOU DOWNTOWN?

29:30.769 --> 29:32.138
UM, JUST
RUNNING ERRANDS.

29:32.138 --> 29:34.140
I WAS JUST DOING
A LITTLE SHOPPING.

29:34.140 --> 29:35.307
A LITTLE?

29:35.307 --> 29:36.542
IT WAS THERAPEUTIC.

29:36.542 --> 29:39.411
ESPECIALLY SINCE I CAN'T
GET IN TOUCH WITH HANNA.

29:39.411 --> 29:41.113
SHE'S FULLY AWOL.

29:41.113 --> 29:43.549
SORRY, I HAVEN'T SEEN
HER SINCE SCHOOL.

29:43.549 --> 29:46.352
OH. ( chuckles )

29:46.352 --> 29:48.988
WELL, IF YOU SEE HER,
COULD YOU JUST...

29:48.988 --> 29:51.190
YOU KNOW WHAT,
NEVER MIND.

29:51.190 --> 29:54.126
DO YOU WANT ME
TO GIVE HER A MESSAGE?

29:55.862 --> 29:58.264
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.
IT'S JUST...

29:58.264 --> 30:00.332
NOEL BROKE UP
WITH ME, AND...

30:00.332 --> 30:02.869
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY
SO I HIT THESE AMAZING SALES

30:02.869 --> 30:04.670
THINKING I COULD JUST
SHOP THE PAIN AWAY.

30:04.670 --> 30:07.406
AND I BOUGHT, LIKE, FIVE
CASHMERE-BLEND SWEATER SETS.

30:07.406 --> 30:09.341
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ME
IN A SWEATER SET?

30:09.341 --> 30:13.312
NO, BECAUSE I DON'T
WEAR SWEATER SETS. OR BLENDS.

30:14.546 --> 30:18.250
I THINK HE BROKE ME.

30:19.318 --> 30:21.253
WAIT. HERE.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.292
I DON'T THAT YOU
DIDN'T ASK ME,

30:26.292 --> 30:28.895
BUT I THINK THAT YOU
CAN RAISE THE BAR
A LITTLE BIT.

30:28.895 --> 30:31.163
I KNOW THAT THERE
ARE PLENTY OF GUYS--

30:31.163 --> 30:33.065
DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD
I HAVE TO WORK

30:33.065 --> 30:36.135
TO GET A GUY LIKE NOEL KAHN
TO GO OUT WITH ME?

30:36.135 --> 30:38.938
WELL, IF YOU'VE BECOME
THE MONA YOU WANT TO BE,

30:38.938 --> 30:40.739
WHY ARE YOU LETTING
NOEL KAHN TELL YOU

30:40.739 --> 30:42.274
THAT YOU'RE NOT
GOOD ENOUGH?

30:42.274 --> 30:46.412
YOU CANNOT LET HIM
SEND YOU SPINNING
BACKWARDS LIKE THAT.

30:49.115 --> 30:52.018
YOU'RE, LIKE, SMART SMART.

30:52.018 --> 30:54.453
I ALWAYS THOUGHT YOU
WERE JUST BOOK SMART.

30:56.355 --> 30:59.225
YOU WANT A SWEATER SET?
CASHMERE BLEND.

30:59.225 --> 31:03.629
UM, I'M COOL, THANKS.

31:07.399 --> 31:08.467
SPENCER.

31:09.635 --> 31:11.203
THANKS.

31:18.810 --> 31:22.414
IT'S SO NICE
TO SEE YOUNG PEOPLE
ENJOYING LIVE THEATER.

31:22.414 --> 31:25.985
MOST OF YOUR PEERS
ARE PROBABLY WATCHING
THEIR YOUTUBES RIGHT NOW.

31:25.985 --> 31:27.786
YOU'D BE SURPRISED
 TO FIND THAT SOME OF US

31:27.786 --> 31:30.622
ARE ABLE TO ACTUALLY CONNECT
 WITH THE REAL WORLD.

31:32.324 --> 31:34.994
SO, WHAT BRINGS
YOU HERE?

31:34.994 --> 31:37.763
UH, OH, A FRIEND OF MINE
HAD AN EXTRA TICKET.

31:37.763 --> 31:41.167
HOLDEN, YOU PROBABLY MISSED
HIM WHILE YOU WERE ABROAD,

31:41.167 --> 31:44.836
BUT, ARIA, YOU REMEMBER
MR. FITZ, DON'T YOU?

31:44.836 --> 31:47.006
OH. IS HE HERE?

31:47.006 --> 31:49.041
NO, I JUST FEEL
TERRIBLE ABOUT IT.

31:49.041 --> 31:51.343
HE HAD TO LEAVE
ABOUT TEN MINUTES IN.

31:51.343 --> 31:54.380
SAID HE DIDN'T
FEEL WELL.

31:57.716 --> 32:03.222
* I CAN HARDLY HOLD
 MYSELF TOGETHER *

32:04.390 --> 32:07.559
CALEB, CALL ME BACK
WHEN YOU GET THIS.

32:10.029 --> 32:13.532
* THIS DAY
 THIS NIGHT *

32:13.532 --> 32:15.267
I MADE YOU SOME.

32:15.267 --> 32:16.868
IT'S ON
THE COUNTER.

32:16.868 --> 32:18.370
TAKE A BATH.

32:20.739 --> 32:23.809
* I NEVER WANNA LEAVE

32:23.809 --> 32:26.678
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

32:26.678 --> 32:27.946
YEAH.

32:27.946 --> 32:30.249
* NO MORE WORDS
 FROM MY LIPS *

32:30.249 --> 32:33.319
YOU KNOW WHERE
TO FIND ME.

32:33.319 --> 32:35.254
* JUST THE LOOK IN YOUR EYES
 SAYS IT ALL *

32:35.254 --> 32:38.757
* SO MUCH MORE
 THAN I COULD EVER *

32:38.757 --> 32:42.294
* I WON'T TRY *

32:42.294 --> 32:45.998
HEY. IT'S ME AGAIN.

32:45.998 --> 32:48.500
I'M SORRY
WE ARGUED EARLIER.

32:48.500 --> 32:51.737
NOW IT'S GETTING DARK,
AND...

32:51.737 --> 32:53.272
AND I'M GETTING WORRIED.

32:54.573 --> 32:56.442
I JUST DON'T THINK
THAT YOU SHOULD BE

32:56.442 --> 32:59.278
OUT THERE BY YOURSELF
LOOKING FOR LUCAS.

32:59.278 --> 33:03.582
SO, CAN YOU JUST
CALL ME OR SOMETHING

33:03.582 --> 33:06.618
SO I CAN AT LEAST KNOW
THAT YOU'RE OKAY?

33:07.719 --> 33:10.656
I GET IT.
YOU'RE STILL MAD AT ME.

33:10.656 --> 33:14.026
JUST... CAN YOU
AT LEAST TEXT ME?

33:14.026 --> 33:17.796
( door banging )

33:17.796 --> 33:20.199
( wind whistling )

33:37.483 --> 33:39.985
Ashley: HANNA,
WHAT WAS THAT NOISE?

33:39.985 --> 33:42.954
UH, JUST THE WIND, MOM.
I THINK THE LATCH IS BROKEN.

33:42.954 --> 33:44.090
WHAT?

33:44.090 --> 33:45.824
THE LATCH
ON THE BACK DOOR.

33:45.824 --> 33:48.327
I THINK WE NEED
TO FIX IT.

34:00.472 --> 34:02.508
( music thumping
inside club )

34:07.213 --> 34:09.081
DID YOU BRING
AN UMBRELLA?

34:09.081 --> 34:10.649
( chuckles )
LINE'S MOVING.

34:10.649 --> 34:13.284
( phone ringing )
JUST HOPE
IT DOESN'T RAIN.

34:18.590 --> 34:22.328
MAYA? IS SOMEONE
BOTHERING YOU?

34:22.328 --> 34:23.862
DO YOU WANT ME
TO ANSWER IT?

34:23.862 --> 34:25.197
NO, NO. I JUST--

34:25.197 --> 34:28.266
UM, I SHOULD PROBABLY
TURN MY PHONE OFF, RIGHT?

34:36.041 --> 34:37.176
EMILY...

34:37.176 --> 34:38.710
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO EXPLAIN.

34:38.710 --> 34:42.813
WHATEVER IT IS,
JUST TELL ME
WHEN YOU'RE READY.

34:43.982 --> 34:45.684
I HOOKED UP
WITH SOMEONE...

34:46.784 --> 34:48.719
WHEN I WAS AWAY.

34:48.719 --> 34:52.358
REMEMBER WHEN YOU CALLED
AND I WAS SORT OF DISTANT?

34:52.358 --> 34:55.827
YEAH. YOU DIDN'T
WANT TO TALK TO ME.

34:55.827 --> 34:57.329
I WAS LONELY.

34:57.329 --> 34:59.298
IT DIDN'T LAST
VERY LONG,

34:59.298 --> 35:00.699
AND I ENDED IT.

35:00.699 --> 35:02.834
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO BE
SCARED TO TELL ME.

35:02.834 --> 35:04.170
WE WERE APART.

35:04.170 --> 35:05.971
YEAH, BUT I SHOULD
HAVE SAID SOMETHING.

35:05.971 --> 35:08.874
I MEAN, WE PROMISED TO GET
TO KNOW EACH OTHER AGAIN,

35:08.874 --> 35:12.178
AND THAT CAN'T HAPPEN
WHEN I'M NOT TELLING THE TRUTH.

35:13.579 --> 35:15.547
I WAS SCARED
THAT TELLING YOU

35:15.547 --> 35:18.317
WOULD GET
IN THE WAY OF THIS.

35:20.786 --> 35:22.521
US.

35:22.521 --> 35:24.055
WELL, IT
DOESN'T HAVE TO.

35:24.055 --> 35:25.324
YOU SAID IT WAS
OVER, RIGHT?

35:25.324 --> 35:26.792
UGH, IT IS, BUT...

35:26.792 --> 35:29.995
IT LOOKS LIKE HE WON'T
TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER.

35:29.995 --> 35:32.864
*

35:35.534 --> 35:36.802
TAXI!

35:36.802 --> 35:41.139
* WHAT YOU DOING HERE
 AT THIS LATE HOUR? *

35:41.139 --> 35:43.542
* PUT TO BED
 THE DREAMS... *

35:43.542 --> 35:47.779
IT'S ABOUT TO GET
CRAZY OUT HERE.

35:47.779 --> 35:50.516
YOU WANNA GRAB
A COFFEE OR SOMETHING?

35:51.917 --> 35:55.120
OH. YEAH.
WE CAN DO THAT.

35:55.120 --> 35:56.922
ONLY IF YOU WANT TO.

35:56.922 --> 35:59.258
OR...

35:59.258 --> 36:01.860
MAYBE YOU WENT OUT WITH
THE WRONG PERSON TONIGHT.

36:01.860 --> 36:03.362
WHAT? NO. I--

36:03.362 --> 36:06.298
I'M GUESSING YOUR
PARENTS DON'T APPROVE.

36:06.298 --> 36:09.067
I SAW THE WAY YOU LOOKED
AT HIM BEFORE THE SHOW,

36:09.067 --> 36:10.236
AND THE LOOK
ON YOUR FACE

36:10.236 --> 36:11.770
WHEN YOU FOUND OUT
HE'D GONE.

36:13.038 --> 36:15.241
I'M SORRY.

36:16.242 --> 36:18.377
LOOK, WHEN MY MOM
GETS HERE,

36:18.377 --> 36:20.078
CAN YOU NOT
MENTION THIS TO HER?

36:20.078 --> 36:21.413
ARIA, WE'RE NOT
FIVE ANYMORE.

36:21.413 --> 36:23.249
I DON'T HAVE TO TELL
YOUR MOM ANYTHING,

36:23.249 --> 36:25.784
AS LONG AS YOU PROMISE
TO DO THE SAME.

36:25.784 --> 36:27.786
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S GOT STUFF

36:27.786 --> 36:30.389
THEY WANNA KEEP
FROM THEIR PARENTS.

36:30.389 --> 36:35.761
SO, HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN SEEING EACH OTHER?

36:35.761 --> 36:38.697
A WHILE.

36:38.697 --> 36:41.400
HEY, I'M SO SORRY.
THIS...

36:41.400 --> 36:43.635
THIS WAS A MISTAKE.

36:43.635 --> 36:46.171
MAYBE IT'S
AN OPPORTUNITY.

36:46.171 --> 36:49.275
YOU BUSY
NEXT FRIDAY?

37:03.922 --> 37:05.824
Ashley: HANNA!

37:07.025 --> 37:09.561
WHERE DID YOU PUT
MY BATH SALTS?

37:09.561 --> 37:12.431
DID YOU FIND THEM
BY THE HAND TOWELS?

37:12.431 --> 37:14.433
FOUND 'EM!

37:21.707 --> 37:23.241
LUCAS!

37:31.317 --> 37:33.251
MY MOM'S
RIGHT DOWN THE HALL.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.153
I NEVER WANTED
TO HURT YOU, HANNA.

37:35.153 --> 37:36.455
WHERE'S CALEB?

37:43.228 --> 37:45.431
WHAT DID
YOU DO TO HIM?

37:49.935 --> 37:52.604
JUST LISTEN TO ME, HANNA.
NO, NO! DON'T COME
ANY CLOSER!

37:54.806 --> 37:56.475
HANNA.

38:00.312 --> 38:02.981
( phone ringing )

38:04.550 --> 38:07.018
WHO'D YOU JUST CALL?
NO ONE, I SWEAR.

38:08.720 --> 38:11.857
GIVE ME THE PHONE
 AND LISTEN TO ME, HANNA!

38:14.225 --> 38:15.994
I CAN'T LET YOU
LEAVE THIS ROOM.

38:15.994 --> 38:18.129
HANNA.

38:18.129 --> 38:19.965
CALEB. YOU'RE HERE.

38:19.965 --> 38:21.400
ARE YOU OKAY?

38:23.402 --> 38:25.236
I'M FINE.

38:25.236 --> 38:26.938
LUCAS, WHAT'S
GOING ON?

38:26.938 --> 38:28.507
WHERE WERE YOU?

38:29.975 --> 38:32.310
I DON'T KNOW HOW EMILY
FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS ME

38:32.310 --> 38:33.845
ON THAT CRISIS HOTLINE,

38:33.845 --> 38:35.781
BUT I KNEW THAT SHE
WAS GOING TO TELL YOU

38:35.781 --> 38:39.485
IF I DID IT, SO I TOOK
YOU OUT ONTO THE LAKE

38:39.485 --> 38:41.286
SO WE COULD BE ALONE.

38:41.286 --> 38:43.455
I NEEDED YOUR HELP.

38:43.455 --> 38:44.690
YEAH, WELL,
IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE THAT.

38:44.690 --> 38:46.592
PROBABLY BECAUSE
OF WAS SCARED MYSELF.

38:46.592 --> 38:49.595
I WAS JUST AFRAID ABOUT
HOW YOU WOULD REACT,

38:49.595 --> 38:53.432
AND I NEED YOU
TO SOFTEN THE BLOW
WHEN I TELL CALEB.

38:54.366 --> 38:56.067
WHEN YOU TELL ME WHAT?

39:02.107 --> 39:05.511
YOUR MONEY... IS GONE.

39:06.412 --> 39:07.713
WHAT MONEY?

39:08.847 --> 39:10.616
WHEN I LEFT TO GO
VISIT MY MOM,

39:10.616 --> 39:12.618
I LEFT A BUNCH OF CASH
STASHED AROUND.

39:12.618 --> 39:15.086
I ASKED LUCAS TO PUT IT
IN HIS CHECKING ACCOUNT

39:15.086 --> 39:17.989
UNTIL I GOT BACK.
SO, WAIT, ALL OF IT?

39:17.989 --> 39:20.291
AND MOST OF MINE, TOO.

39:20.291 --> 39:22.628
HOW MUCH?
$4,000.

39:22.628 --> 39:24.496
THAT'S A LOT
OF MONEY, LUCAS.

39:24.496 --> 39:26.565
IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME
TO MAKE THAT.

39:26.565 --> 39:28.534
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
A SURE THING.

39:28.534 --> 39:29.835
A SURE THING?

39:29.835 --> 39:32.170
I WAS JUST BETTING
ON A BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT.

39:32.170 --> 39:33.639
WHAT?
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

39:33.639 --> 39:35.674
IT WAS JUST
FOR FUN AT FIRST,

39:35.674 --> 39:39.010
A BUNCH OF MATH
AND PROBABILITY STUFF,

39:39.010 --> 39:41.913
SEEING IF I COULD FIGURE OUT
A FORMULA TO BEAT THE ODDS.

39:41.913 --> 39:45.517
I WAS SO SURE THAT I WOULD
WIN YOUR MONEY BACK.

39:45.517 --> 39:48.119
THE TEAM GOT
DISQUALIFIED,

39:48.119 --> 39:49.788
THREW MY BRACKET OFF.

39:49.788 --> 39:51.723
THE PAYOFF
NEVER HAPPENED.

39:51.723 --> 39:54.392
AND THEN SUDDENLY YOU WERE
JUST BACK FROM CALIFORNIA

39:54.392 --> 39:56.928
AND I HAD LOST EVERYTHING.

39:56.928 --> 40:00.398
IS THAT WHY YOU DIDN'T
COME BACK AFTER THE LAKE?

40:00.398 --> 40:03.334
YOU WERE JUST GONNA
RUN AWAY?

40:03.334 --> 40:05.504
I JUST WANT
TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT.

40:20.886 --> 40:22.788
IT'S NOT EVERYTHING,
BUT IT'S...

40:22.788 --> 40:24.623
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?

40:24.623 --> 40:27.459
I WAS DRIVING AROUND
TO DIFFERENT
COMIC BOOK STORES

40:27.459 --> 40:30.529
HERE, DOWNSTATE,
AND IN NEW JERSEY.

40:31.563 --> 40:34.265
SOLD A BUNCH
OF MY COLLECTIBLES.

40:34.265 --> 40:37.168
I KNOW IT'S NOT EVERYTHING,
BUT IT'S A START.

40:39.204 --> 40:41.406
I'M REALLY SORRY, CALEB.

40:41.406 --> 40:44.442
WE'LL WORK IT OUT.

40:44.442 --> 40:45.711
HANNA?

40:46.645 --> 40:48.914
PLEASE SAY SOMETHING.

40:51.783 --> 40:54.152
YOU'RE NOT WHO
I THOUGHT YOU WERE.

41:02.694 --> 41:05.130
SO WAIT, SOMEBODY ELSE
SHOWED UP AT THE GREENHOUSE

41:05.130 --> 41:06.998
WHEN WE SET
THAT TRAP FOR "A"?

41:06.998 --> 41:07.933
IT WASN'T LUCAS?

41:07.933 --> 41:09.735
WHAT ABOUT
THE WATER BOTTLE?

41:09.735 --> 41:11.169
AND THE STUNT
WITH THE ROWBOAT?

41:11.169 --> 41:12.938
NO, LUCAS WASN'T
EVEN IN ROSEWOOD.

41:12.938 --> 41:14.806
HE WAS DRIVING AROUND
ALL NIGHT TRYING

41:14.806 --> 41:16.842
TO SELL HIS COLLECTIBLES
TO PAY CALEB BACK.

41:16.842 --> 41:19.110
SPENCE, WHAT DID YOU
WANT TO SHOW US?

41:19.110 --> 41:20.178
OH, YEAH.

41:20.178 --> 41:22.247
HEY, DID
YOU ORDER DUMPLINGS?
TWO ORDERS.

41:24.516 --> 41:26.451
WHAT IS THIS?

41:26.451 --> 41:29.555
THIS IS THE SIGN-IN BOOK
FROM JENNA'S BLIND REHAB CENTER.

41:29.555 --> 41:31.489
THIS IS THE DAY BEFORE
ALISON WENT MISSING.

41:31.489 --> 41:35.727
MM.
JENNA SAID THAT ALISON
CAME TO VISIT HER THAT DAY.

41:35.727 --> 41:37.863
I DON'T SEE
ALI'S NAME.

41:37.863 --> 41:40.431
WAIT, SO THAT STORY
SHE TOLD US, THAT WAS A LIE?

41:40.431 --> 41:43.034
WELL, WHO KNOWS,
BUT THAT'S NOT ALL.

41:43.034 --> 41:44.536
LOOK WHO DID VISIT.

41:44.536 --> 41:46.572
GARRETT REYNOLDS.
HE WAS THERE FOR,

41:46.572 --> 41:48.740
LIKE, WHAT, 20 MINUTES
THAT NIGHT?

41:48.740 --> 41:50.275
AND NOT ONLY DO GUESTS
HAVE TO SIGN IN,

41:50.275 --> 41:52.711
THEY ALSO KEEP TRACK
OF WHEN THE PATIENTS LEAVE.

41:52.711 --> 41:55.013
GARRETT SIGNED JENNA OUT
AT 10:15 P.M.

41:55.013 --> 41:57.148
AND THERE'S NO TIME
THAT THEY SIGNED BACK IN.

41:57.148 --> 41:58.884
SHE COULD'VE BEEN
GONE ALL NIGHT.

41:58.884 --> 42:00.418
CAN WE JUST LOOK
AT THIS LATER?

42:00.418 --> 42:03.021
IF I DON'T EAT SOMETHING,
MY HEAD IS GOING TO EXPLODE.

42:03.021 --> 42:05.056
ARIA, WOULD YOU PLEASE
PASS THOSE PLATES?

42:05.056 --> 42:06.925
YEAH, SURE.

42:06.925 --> 42:08.794
JENNA SAID THAT ALISON
BLACKMAILED HER

42:08.794 --> 42:10.028
AND THAT SHE STAYED
IN REHAB

42:10.028 --> 42:11.296
UNTIL THE DAY
OF ALISON'S FUNERAL.

42:11.296 --> 42:13.565
SO WHERE WAS SHE
THE NIGHT ALI WENT MISSING?

42:13.565 --> 42:15.366
SHE COULD'VE
BEEN ANYWHERE.

42:15.366 --> 42:18.236
HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT TO BET
SHE WAS IN ROSEWOOD?

42:20.538 --> 42:22.608
( gasping )
OH, MY GOD!

42:26.244 --> 42:28.747
OH, I'M GONNA BE SICK.

42:31.617 --> 42:33.885
( cell phone dings )

42:37.022 --> 42:39.090
"THIS IS WHAT LIVE BAIT
LOOKS LIKE.

42:39.090 --> 42:41.827
NOW WE'RE
EVEN, BITCHES. - 'A.'"

43:10.789 --> 43:12.323
( ratcheting )
