00:13.055 --> 00:15.124
Whenever
I wanted to remember

00:15.191 --> 00:17.159
what was important in my life

00:18.160 --> 00:20.162
I used to walk to
the local cemetery.

00:21.596 --> 00:25.567
1,000 people, probably
more, are buried here.

00:25.634 --> 00:27.736
Each one ending up in the same

00:27.802 --> 00:31.873
two square mile patch
of grass for eternity.

00:33.209 --> 00:35.744
How many people are
still remembered?

00:35.810 --> 00:37.146
I mean, at what point

00:37.213 --> 00:40.649
does that last memory
of you disappear?

01:53.855 --> 01:54.789
Good morning. Sunshine.

01:54.856 --> 01:56.359
Not morning, Daddy.

01:56.425 --> 01:58.693
It's very late, after 11.

01:58.760 --> 02:01.364
I just flew in from Los Angeles.

02:01.430 --> 02:02.398
Oh.

02:02.465 --> 02:03.565
You don't look so good.

02:04.100 --> 02:06.235
Well of course I
don't look so good.

02:06.302 --> 02:07.802
I'm this close to 80.

02:08.570 --> 02:10.505
Hm, that is pretty old.

02:10.572 --> 02:11.673
Yeah.

02:12.807 --> 02:16.078
I remember when rainbows
were black and white.

02:16.145 --> 02:17.313
That's how old I am.

02:17.380 --> 02:18.747
Death isn't knocking on my door,

02:18.813 --> 02:21.017
it's sitting in the bedroom.

02:21.083 --> 02:22.517
Don't say that.

02:22.584 --> 02:24.819
You're fine, you're still here.

02:24.887 --> 02:27.822
And for a long time, I imagine.

02:27.890 --> 02:29.758
Always the optimist.

02:29.824 --> 02:31.626
The Irish in you wants to know

02:31.693 --> 02:34.696
if the will has been
signed, and it hasn't.

02:34.763 --> 02:38.533
No, no, you're going to
live a long, long time.

02:38.600 --> 02:41.037
I'm going to make sure of it.

02:41.103 --> 02:42.004
Nine months.

02:43.205 --> 02:44.773
Nine months, what?

02:44.839 --> 02:46.042
I give it nine months.

02:47.343 --> 02:49.945
That will give me time to
have one more birthday.

02:50.012 --> 02:50.845
And then-

02:50.913 --> 02:51.914
- Nine months, and then what?

02:51.981 --> 02:54.250
And then I'm off, time to fly.

02:54.316 --> 02:56.952
I look at this as a
long overdue vacation.

02:57.019 --> 02:59.687
I'm not listening
to you anymore.

02:59.754 --> 03:02.058
You don't have to,
that's your choice.

03:02.124 --> 03:04.160
An unfortunate one,
but don't be mad

03:04.226 --> 03:08.197
nine months from now if
I say, "I told you so."

03:08.264 --> 03:11.901
Mm, that is the error
in your plan, dear sir.

03:11.967 --> 03:14.537
In order to say,
"I told you so,"

03:14.602 --> 03:16.972
you'd still have to be alive.

03:17.039 --> 03:20.708
Yeah, well, I stand corrected.

03:20.775 --> 03:22.044
Nine months nonetheless.

03:22.111 --> 03:24.880
A baby takes nine
months to be born.

03:24.947 --> 03:28.384
I'm taking nine
months to say goodbye.

03:28.451 --> 03:30.052
It's only fair.

03:30.752 --> 03:32.288
Okay.

03:32.354 --> 03:33.322
Goodnight, Daddy.

03:34.622 --> 03:35.524
Mwah.

03:39.962 --> 03:42.298
Good news, you're
going to live.

03:42.364 --> 03:43.765
Not for very long, mind you,

03:43.832 --> 03:46.035
but long enough to be
able to pay my bills.

03:47.369 --> 03:48.337
Why are you smiling?

03:48.404 --> 03:49.438
Stop smiling.

03:49.505 --> 03:50.506
It doesn't suit you very well.

03:50.573 --> 03:52.141
You're not a smiley kind of man.

03:53.342 --> 03:56.744
Oh God, it's the
menopause, isn't it?

03:56.811 --> 03:59.148
It's not menopause.

03:59.215 --> 04:01.984
Well, I'm waiting.

04:02.051 --> 04:03.486
Come on, stop smiling like that.

04:03.552 --> 04:04.587
You're scaring me.

04:04.652 --> 04:06.255
I'm sorry.

04:06.322 --> 04:07.990
It's not every day that a
man gets to tell his daughter

04:08.057 --> 04:10.459
that he's going to
be a grandfather.

04:12.461 --> 04:13.761
I'm pregnant?

04:13.828 --> 04:15.097
Yes, you are.

04:16.565 --> 04:19.535
No, no, can't be, no.

04:19.601 --> 04:21.103
Well, have you had sex lately?

04:21.170 --> 04:22.004
A few times.

04:22.071 --> 04:23.239
Not very memorable, but. What?

04:23.305 --> 04:24.540
Well then you can.

04:24.607 --> 04:25.874
And that's how
it's done nowadays.

04:25.941 --> 04:27.443
I mean, have for
some time actually.

04:27.510 --> 04:29.245
But I can get you a pamphlet
about it if you like.

04:29.311 --> 04:30.212
A pamphlet?

04:31.846 --> 04:34.550
Dad, I can't have a baby.

04:34.617 --> 04:37.386
I'm too old to have a baby.

04:37.453 --> 04:38.753
I've been systematically unable

04:38.820 --> 04:40.489
to raise myself for
the past 40 years.

04:40.556 --> 04:41.823
How am I going to raise a child?

04:41.891 --> 04:43.259
You'll have to-
What do I do?

04:43.325 --> 04:45.928
Stop smoking and
drinking to start with.

04:45.995 --> 04:47.396
I like to smoke.

04:47.463 --> 04:48.730
Yeah, you can do it.

04:48.796 --> 04:49.899
You have to do it.

04:49.965 --> 04:50.966
I mean, you don't want a baby

04:51.033 --> 04:53.002
shaped like shrimps now, do ya?

04:53.868 --> 04:57.640
This cannot be happening.

04:57.705 --> 04:59.308
I'm too old.

04:59.375 --> 05:00.742
I'll be like 90 years old

05:00.808 --> 05:02.611
by the time the thing
goes to high school.

05:02.677 --> 05:04.280
Well, you're
slightly exaggerating.

05:04.346 --> 05:05.214
And my tits.

05:05.281 --> 05:06.482
Dad, my tits.

05:06.549 --> 05:09.084
Will be fine, I assure you.

05:09.151 --> 05:13.022
Seriously, dear,
this is a good thing.

05:17.326 --> 05:19.161
Keys, keys, keys.

05:19.995 --> 05:22.198
Keys, keys, keys, keys, keys.

05:24.200 --> 05:27.670
Terri, have
you seen my keys?

05:27.735 --> 05:28.836
Shoot.

05:30.005 --> 05:32.641
Shit, shit, shit.

05:32.707 --> 05:33.876
You mean these?

05:33.943 --> 05:35.945
Ah, yes, thank you.

05:36.011 --> 05:37.446
- I'll be late.
- Whoop.

05:37.513 --> 05:38.780
How about you take your
ever-loving girlfriend

05:38.846 --> 05:40.216
with you, please.

05:40.282 --> 05:41.450
Listen, I know what
you're doing, okay?

05:41.517 --> 05:42.817
Please?

05:42.885 --> 05:43.886
And meeting my
family at a funeral

05:43.953 --> 05:44.987
is probably a terrible idea.

05:45.054 --> 05:46.355
They're eccentric, so just no.

05:46.422 --> 05:48.190
Look, we can say
we're just friends.

05:48.257 --> 05:50.059
And I promise, no smooching
in front of the dead guy.

05:50.125 --> 05:53.429
Okay, yeah, listen.

05:53.495 --> 05:55.064
Okay, listen.

05:55.130 --> 05:56.764
I know what you're doing, I
do, and I love you for it,

05:56.831 --> 05:59.001
but I don't want to go and you
certainly don't want to go.

05:59.068 --> 06:00.735
Okay, here, I'm going
to help you with this.

06:00.802 --> 06:02.770
Okay, I'm late, but.

06:05.074 --> 06:06.475
Okay, you know
what, no, I'm late.

06:06.542 --> 06:07.409
I don't have time for this.

06:07.476 --> 06:08.843
I gotta get going.

06:08.911 --> 06:10.446
Here, give me one
kiss, give me one kiss.

06:12.147 --> 06:13.916
Okay, you know what,
this is happening.

06:24.560 --> 06:25.427
You're late.

06:25.494 --> 06:26.929
I know, I'm sorry.

06:26.996 --> 06:29.231
Sorry isn't going to
help out Uncle Charlie.

06:29.298 --> 06:30.666
You know what, you're right.

06:30.733 --> 06:32.101
Uncle Charlie.

06:32.167 --> 06:33.669
I'm going to go home
and shag some more.

06:33.736 --> 06:36.272
You tell the whole family
I was here, won't you?

06:36.338 --> 06:39.408
Mm, that better have
been involuntary.

06:39.475 --> 06:41.176
My body may have
a mind of its own

06:41.243 --> 06:43.646
but at least I managed
to get it here on time.

06:43.712 --> 06:45.180
Now behave yourself.

06:45.247 --> 06:47.883
Or I may have to accidentally
assault you again.

06:49.618 --> 06:51.053
And what did I miss?

06:51.120 --> 06:53.155
So far we've had
three eulogies,

06:53.222 --> 06:55.157
all from people
that never met him.

06:55.224 --> 06:56.525
One of them kept
calling him Charlton

06:56.592 --> 07:00.129
and talking about how
good of a person he was.

07:00.195 --> 07:02.197
Clearly never met the man.

07:03.132 --> 07:04.400
Aunt Margaret's up next.

07:06.468 --> 07:07.369
You're kidding me.

07:10.906 --> 07:16.312
I remember Larry
as a kind man.

07:16.378 --> 07:17.279
Larry?

07:18.147 --> 07:20.749
Not the biggest
penis I've ever seen.

07:21.950 --> 07:24.553
But he used it well.

07:29.491 --> 07:30.726
Yeah, of course
he named his own cat Catie.

07:30.793 --> 07:31.859
Like Katie but Catie.

07:31.927 --> 07:33.128
I just find it weird

07:33.195 --> 07:34.463
that you put it
on your backpack.

07:34.530 --> 07:35.664
- Ridiculous.
- Because I love her.

07:35.731 --> 07:36.699
Ah, ah, ah, ah, Dave.

07:36.765 --> 07:37.733
It's my turn for the bed.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.401
Don't get too comfortable.

07:39.867 --> 07:40.769
Hey, you coming?

07:40.835 --> 07:42.071
We got some beer.

07:42.870 --> 07:43.972
All right.

07:45.074 --> 07:46.308
You guys ready to party?

08:07.629 --> 08:09.264
Yeah, oh.

08:09.331 --> 08:11.133
Yeah, we can fix
that in a jiffy.

08:11.200 --> 08:14.136
I need you to close
your eyes for a second.

08:14.203 --> 08:15.704
Oh, perhaps it
would be a good idea

08:15.771 --> 08:16.839
if we all closed our eyes.

08:16.905 --> 08:18.073
Maybe it's better if I just-

08:18.140 --> 08:19.141
- No, no, no, I didn't mean me.

08:19.208 --> 08:20.909
I meant your friends here.

08:22.144 --> 08:23.846
You have somehow managed to do

08:23.912 --> 08:28.183
what almost nobody's been
able to do in nearly 50 years.

08:28.250 --> 08:29.651
Shooting your ear off

08:29.718 --> 08:31.987
while killing a pigeon
with the same bullet.

08:32.054 --> 08:33.188
Impressive.

08:33.255 --> 08:35.457
Americans and your guns.

08:35.524 --> 08:37.592
Probably born with
one up your arse.

08:38.559 --> 08:41.929
Our father was
Canadian actually.

08:41.996 --> 08:43.631
Oh really?

08:43.698 --> 08:46.502
Well that would explain that
lack of aim now, wouldn't it?

08:55.244 --> 08:59.815
My late 40s, too old
for this baby nonsense.

08:59.883 --> 09:00.983
You are too.

09:02.618 --> 09:05.320
I hope you're not saying
what I think you're saying.

09:07.289 --> 09:10.259
You're seriously
considering keeping it?

09:11.393 --> 09:14.396
You're not seriously
considering me not keeping it?

09:16.231 --> 09:17.733
We talked about this before.

09:17.800 --> 09:20.602
And we always said we'd
keep it if it happened.

09:20.669 --> 09:23.105
And God knows it
happened, Gordon.

09:23.172 --> 09:24.706
I'm not puking my brains out

09:24.773 --> 09:27.176
for the past week for no reason.

09:27.242 --> 09:28.878
That was 10 years ago.

09:28.944 --> 09:32.014
You know, when we were both
young enough to have children.

09:32.714 --> 09:33.982
Barely sexual now.

09:34.049 --> 09:36.051
I'm surprised you're
pregnant at all.

09:37.252 --> 09:38.987
Charlie Chaplin was
something like, what,

09:39.054 --> 09:40.989
80 years old when he
had his last child?

09:41.056 --> 09:42.858
Yeah, and he died soon after,

09:42.926 --> 09:44.226
leaving a young child behind.

09:44.293 --> 09:45.627
Look, Laurel, don't
get me started.

09:45.694 --> 09:47.129
We're not having a baby.

09:48.430 --> 09:50.599
You can't even look after
a dog, let alone a baby.

09:55.871 --> 09:58.373
You're either taking the
both of us or neither of us.

10:01.577 --> 10:02.478
Your choice.

10:05.915 --> 10:07.015
Daddy!

10:09.852 --> 10:11.286
Don't even ask.

10:11.353 --> 10:13.188
Come on, yeah, come in.

10:14.356 --> 10:15.257
Oh, don't kick the cat, dear.

10:15.324 --> 10:16.458
She doesn't like that.

10:19.461 --> 10:21.363
That was absolutely
scrumptious.

10:21.430 --> 10:23.232
You know, you really should
consider cooking for a living.

10:23.298 --> 10:25.334
Oh, strangely enough,
I do cook for a living.

10:25.400 --> 10:26.903
Oh well then, congratulations,

10:26.970 --> 10:29.037
you've found your life's path.

10:29.104 --> 10:31.039
Speaking of life's path,

10:31.106 --> 10:34.376
do you think it's about
time I meet your family?

10:36.345 --> 10:37.746
No, you don't want to do that.

10:37.813 --> 10:40.516
I mean, they're ogres,
they're evil really.

10:41.885 --> 10:44.486
Uninteresting people,
insufferable bores, general retards.

10:44.553 --> 10:46.088
Jack, we've been
dating for six months

10:46.154 --> 10:47.756
and they don't
even know I exist.

10:49.491 --> 10:51.393
They do know you exist.

10:51.460 --> 10:55.631
They're just terribly upset at
the fact that I am dating a-

10:55.697 --> 10:58.100
- A pretty blonde?

10:58.166 --> 11:00.736
Yes. They hate
blondes, they really do.

11:00.802 --> 11:02.271
It's a family tradition.

11:03.305 --> 11:05.774
My grandfather, he was
killed by a blonde.

11:05.841 --> 11:07.609
And they never found
out who the killer is

11:07.676 --> 11:08.710
so there's been an innate
fear of blondes ever since.

11:08.777 --> 11:10.178
Blondes?

11:10.245 --> 11:11.647
Yes, yeah,
especially pretty ones.

11:11.713 --> 11:13.348
Your whole family
is afraid of blondes?

11:13.415 --> 11:17.386
Mm-hm, yeah, yeah,
except for me obviously,

11:17.452 --> 11:19.521
'cause I've had to
work at it, so yeah.

11:20.355 --> 11:22.524
Ah, well, maybe
they can work at it.

11:23.525 --> 11:25.294
No, no, I don't think so.

11:25.360 --> 11:28.530
I mean, they do kill all
blonde babies born, so.

11:35.237 --> 11:38.007
Your family kills
blonde babies?

11:38.073 --> 11:39.875
Yeah, yep.

11:39.943 --> 11:42.811
But there are a lot
of babies born blonde

11:42.879 --> 11:45.547
and then when they grow older,
their hair changes color.

11:45.614 --> 11:47.649
You're not buying a
word of this, are you?

11:47.716 --> 11:48.617
No, not one.

11:51.687 --> 11:52.588
Yeah.

11:54.122 --> 11:55.223
Morning, dear.

11:56.525 --> 11:57.225
Daddy.

11:58.293 --> 12:01.730
May I say that you look
absolutely dreadful this morning.

12:01.797 --> 12:02.764
Thank you.

12:02.831 --> 12:04.466
Oh, no need to thank me.

12:04.533 --> 12:07.202
I just wanted it noted that
you do indeed look like shit.

12:07.269 --> 12:08.770
You are not helping.

12:08.837 --> 12:11.074
Well, I could suggest to
a shower or some makeup.

12:11.139 --> 12:13.241
- But after that-
- Daddy.

12:13.308 --> 12:14.343
Yes, pumpkin.

12:14.409 --> 12:16.745
- Shut up.
- Well said.

12:16.812 --> 12:17.779
And shut up I will.

12:18.447 --> 12:21.416
But if you decide at some point

12:21.483 --> 12:26.254
that you'd like to discuss
you turning up at my door

12:26.321 --> 12:31.526
at 2:00 a.m. with two
large bags of clothing,

12:32.527 --> 12:34.730
I'd be happy to partake
in that conversation.

12:34.796 --> 12:35.797
I'm sorry.

12:37.432 --> 12:40.535
This, it's just a
mess with Gordon

12:40.602 --> 12:43.505
and this whole baby fiasco.

12:43.572 --> 12:45.474
Maybe I should
just get rid of it.

12:46.308 --> 12:47.409
What do you think?

12:48.777 --> 12:52.547
I can honestly say that
my decision has always been

12:52.614 --> 12:54.783
to err on the side
of giving it a go.

12:57.786 --> 13:00.355
Worst case scenario,
41 years later

13:00.422 --> 13:03.625
they show up at your door
at two in the morning

13:05.128 --> 13:06.728
telling you to shut the hell up.

13:07.462 --> 13:12.768
I'll see you later.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.369
You love her?

13:14.436 --> 13:15.771
Of course I love her.

13:15.837 --> 13:17.606
Not as much as this
egg salad sandwich.

13:17.673 --> 13:19.108
Thank you for bringing
it, by the way.

13:19.174 --> 13:21.710
But yeah, almost as much.

13:21.777 --> 13:25.982
If she sails your boat,
you should sail off with her.

13:27.150 --> 13:29.584
You know, if she beats
your drum, you should beat-

13:29.651 --> 13:33.022
- As much as I love your
metaphors and your witticisms,

13:33.089 --> 13:35.323
it's just not that simple.

13:35.390 --> 13:36.625
Why is it so hard?

13:37.626 --> 13:40.096
You just tell her
that you love her.

13:40.163 --> 13:41.697
And then you get married

13:41.763 --> 13:45.367
and you shag her 3.2 times
a week for the first year.

13:45.434 --> 13:47.904
And then you have a baby.

13:47.970 --> 13:50.073
And then I'm a nappy
king for two years.

13:50.139 --> 13:53.375
Probably longer, because
most women want two.

13:53.442 --> 13:55.310
So four years then.

13:55.377 --> 13:57.579
But knowing you,
Sir Shags-a-Lot,

13:57.646 --> 13:59.182
there'll be a surprise
baby in there somewhere.

13:59.247 --> 14:01.017
So, you know, you
better make it six.

14:01.084 --> 14:02.118
Six years?

14:02.185 --> 14:03.618
Oh my God, are you kidding me?

14:03.685 --> 14:05.754
You just
get it snipped.

14:06.855 --> 14:07.756
Snipped?

14:10.659 --> 14:12.794
I did them all myself, huh?

14:12.861 --> 14:16.199
I kinda fancy myself
a closet artist.

14:16.264 --> 14:19.401
You know, who knows, maybe
I went into the wrong field.

14:19.468 --> 14:22.370
Okay, so what's the
matter with him, doc?

14:22.437 --> 14:23.906
Well, for starters,
he keeps shooting

14:23.973 --> 14:25.240
his frigging ears off.

14:25.307 --> 14:26.608
I mean, I would
consider that to be

14:26.675 --> 14:28.510
his biggest problem
at the moment.

14:28.577 --> 14:30.512
This isn't anything new.

14:30.579 --> 14:34.016
He's been trying to
kill himself for years.

14:34.083 --> 14:35.484
Oh well, that would explain

14:35.550 --> 14:37.652
the multiple shootings
now, wouldn't it?

14:37.719 --> 14:39.922
What can we do about it now?

14:39.989 --> 14:41.757
For starters, take
the gun away from him.

14:41.823 --> 14:43.792
It makes it harder, you know,
to shoot one's ears off.

14:43.859 --> 14:46.595
Yeah. but is there
anything we can do about it?

14:46.661 --> 14:47.930
Well, I think a
better question is,

14:47.997 --> 14:49.731
is there anything
he can do about it?

14:49.798 --> 14:51.466
Well, we're supposed to
be in Montreal next week.

14:51.533 --> 14:54.137
I mean we're on a
year-long road trip, so.

14:54.203 --> 14:58.306
Oh no, I wouldn't, I wouldn't.

14:58.373 --> 15:00.109
I wouldn't leave
until he's better.

15:01.110 --> 15:04.279
You know, perhaps we
can have him evaluated,

15:04.346 --> 15:05.847
mentally I mean.

15:05.915 --> 15:07.549
You know, I have a friend
at the Wellesley Clinic.

15:07.616 --> 15:09.118
He could to assess him for you.

15:09.185 --> 15:12.021
Look, doc, we don't really
even have enough money

15:12.088 --> 15:14.123
to stay in Canada much longer.

15:14.190 --> 15:17.592
Pretty soon Peter is going
to have to start stripping.

15:17.659 --> 15:18.760
Tits are too small.

15:20.629 --> 15:23.398
Oh, I have an idea.

15:23.465 --> 15:26.202
I have to go back
to Los Angeles.

15:26.269 --> 15:27.203
You're a writer.

15:27.270 --> 15:28.204
You can write anywhere.

15:28.271 --> 15:29.571
You can write here.

15:31.140 --> 15:34.776
You can't go back until,
you know, I.

15:37.445 --> 15:38.446
I got eight months.

15:38.513 --> 15:40.549
That isn't too much to ask for.

15:40.615 --> 15:42.717
No, no, no,
you're going to live

15:42.784 --> 15:44.452
a lot longer than
that and you know it.

15:44.519 --> 15:45.754
And this is unfair to me.

15:45.821 --> 15:48.191
I have to get back to work.

15:48.257 --> 15:49.258
But you're a writer.

15:49.324 --> 15:50.893
You can do that right here.

15:50.960 --> 15:53.262
You don't have to go
back there to write.

15:53.328 --> 15:57.200
I went to California with
Mom because I hate it here.

15:57.266 --> 15:59.601
It's just so much blah.

15:59.668 --> 16:01.837
I can't write, it's too cold.

16:02.838 --> 16:05.807
You know, blah can be
very good for a writer.

16:07.375 --> 16:09.811
It forces you into
the writing mode.

16:12.714 --> 16:15.985
All right, I will
make you a deal.

16:17.619 --> 16:19.088
I will stay awhile,

16:19.155 --> 16:21.924
but you can't get mad
when I leave later, deal?

16:24.327 --> 16:26.896
- Your move.
- Deal?

16:26.963 --> 16:27.863
Your move.

16:37.639 --> 16:38.908
Oh bollocks.

16:40.542 --> 16:43.145
Can you tell me why
you feel that way?

16:43.212 --> 16:46.848
Is there something in
particular that triggers it?

16:52.989 --> 16:56.092
I really don't know
why I feel this way.

16:56.158 --> 16:58.793
If I did, I probably
wouldn't be here, right?

17:01.898 --> 17:06.135
Well, perhaps you
should just try taking it

17:07.103 --> 17:10.638
one day at a time,
simplify things.

17:10.704 --> 17:13.175
Take one breath, one step.

17:13.242 --> 17:14.809
Don't try to overthink it.

17:15.944 --> 17:17.914
Sometimes depression
is just something

17:17.980 --> 17:20.515
you need to work
through using therapy.

17:21.951 --> 17:22.851
Mm-hm.

17:25.720 --> 17:27.189
Your friends are
very concerned.

17:27.256 --> 17:28.391
I don't care.

17:28.455 --> 17:29.992
They can leave if they want.

17:34.763 --> 17:37.866
If they wanted to, I assure
you they'd already have.

17:45.174 --> 17:47.977
Mm, something
smells delicious.

17:48.044 --> 17:49.178
What is that?

17:49.245 --> 17:50.812
You're going to
get a fork in the eye

17:50.880 --> 17:52.148
if you don't back off
until I'm finished.

17:52.214 --> 17:54.649
A fork, wow, that
sounds violent.

17:54.716 --> 17:56.085
Maybe I'll just stop
by the sushi place

17:56.152 --> 17:57.652
for a little takeout, huh?

17:58.486 --> 18:00.488
Fine, grump.

18:01.623 --> 18:04.126
Mm, mm, scrumdiddlyumptious.

18:06.528 --> 18:08.030
What is that?

18:08.097 --> 18:10.900
Oh, it's reindeer testicles,
a Norwegian delicacy.

18:12.034 --> 18:13.568
It's chicken.

18:13.635 --> 18:15.237
Chicken, you dick.

18:15.304 --> 18:16.838
Mm, I'm sorry.

18:16.906 --> 18:18.975
I'm sorry, I didn't, I thought-

18:19.041 --> 18:21.077
- You thought I was serving
you reindeer testicles?

18:21.143 --> 18:22.644
What, are you drunk?

18:22.711 --> 18:24.246
What? No, I'm not drunk.

18:24.313 --> 18:26.548
I've just been thinking
about my testicles a lot today.

18:26.614 --> 18:30.252
You've been thinking about
your testicles all day today?

18:30.319 --> 18:32.121
Yeah, but not in a weird way.

18:32.188 --> 18:33.889
In like, I don't know,

18:33.956 --> 18:37.525
no nappies makes me
happy kind of a way.

18:38.860 --> 18:40.963
Are you trying to
tell me something?

18:42.131 --> 18:43.299
What? No, no.

18:43.366 --> 18:45.301
I'm just, I'm trying
to figure my life out.

18:45.368 --> 18:47.836
And you don't think
that discussing that

18:47.903 --> 18:50.339
with your girlfriend
is important?

18:50.406 --> 18:54.110
Well, I mean, technically
they are my testicles, so.

18:56.312 --> 18:57.645
You don't want to have kids?

18:57.712 --> 18:59.248
What? No.

18:59.315 --> 19:00.648
I never said that.

19:00.715 --> 19:02.084
It's not that I don't
want to have kids.

19:03.953 --> 19:06.521
It's that you don't
want to have kids with me.

19:08.057 --> 19:09.158
What? No.

19:09.225 --> 19:10.625
I never said that.

19:11.327 --> 19:12.328
Please don't cry.

19:12.395 --> 19:13.896
I'm allowed to cry, okay?

19:13.963 --> 19:15.597
You just told me you'd
rather cut off your pecker

19:15.663 --> 19:17.233
than have kids with me.

19:19.135 --> 19:20.036
You can eat alone.

19:23.072 --> 19:27.842
David is what we call
clinically depressed.

19:28.810 --> 19:30.578
But what worries me
mostly, obviously,

19:30.645 --> 19:35.850
is that he continues to
express suicidal wishes.

19:36.851 --> 19:39.188
Oh, we can medicate to help
control the depression.

19:39.255 --> 19:43.792
But the need to hurt himself
will continue, I'm afraid,

19:43.858 --> 19:46.529
until we get to the
source of the problem.

19:47.530 --> 19:49.165
He's been like
this a long time.

19:49.231 --> 19:51.100
He's worse on this trip.

19:52.368 --> 19:54.803
We thought, quite frankly,
that it would help.

19:55.938 --> 19:58.673
How young was he
when all this started?

19:58.740 --> 20:02.677
Um, 14, maybe 15.

20:03.446 --> 20:05.680
And how many attempts.

20:07.083 --> 20:12.288
Altogether, 20, maybe 30.

20:12.955 --> 20:13.855
30?

20:15.790 --> 20:17.193
Unbelievable.

20:18.994 --> 20:21.596
And he hasn't been
hospitalized till now?

20:23.598 --> 20:27.069
Well, he hasn't been successful

20:27.136 --> 20:29.637
so we can count
that as a blessing.

20:30.973 --> 20:33.808
Or maybe it was just that was

20:34.776 --> 20:37.079
a cry for help,
a very large cry.

20:40.116 --> 20:43.385
Let's not try to let
it hit 31, shall we?

20:44.786 --> 20:46.088
What about your family?

20:47.556 --> 20:48.690
They're all dead.

20:49.525 --> 20:52.094
We're all he has left.

20:53.395 --> 20:55.797
Well, I'm sure that's
all he needs too.

21:00.503 --> 21:04.907
So I'd like to keep
him for a month or two.

21:04.974 --> 21:08.077
This simply cannot continue.

21:09.078 --> 21:11.113
Oh, you can visit him
anytime you want, but.

21:14.583 --> 21:17.119
Do you have anywhere to
stay in the meantime?

21:40.342 --> 21:41.644
What?

21:41.709 --> 21:43.811
Is this Dr. Leaver's house?

21:43.879 --> 21:44.947
Yes, it is.

21:45.548 --> 21:46.482
Look, I'm very sick.

21:46.549 --> 21:47.782
What can I do for you?

21:47.849 --> 21:49.051
We're Dr. Leaver's
new boarders.

21:49.118 --> 21:52.754
Boarders, American boarders?

21:52.820 --> 21:54.423
Oh Christ, no.

21:54.490 --> 21:55.790
Have you lost your mind?

21:55.857 --> 21:57.825
Brilliant,
you have us.

21:57.893 --> 21:58.860
Invited
them to stay here?

21:58.928 --> 22:00.496
They can't stay here.

22:00.563 --> 22:02.164
Coming from someone who
never asked to live here,

22:02.231 --> 22:04.233
I'd say that your opinion
means diddly-squat.

22:04.300 --> 22:05.367
Go sit down, dear.

22:05.434 --> 22:07.002
You got vomit on your chin.

22:07.069 --> 22:09.071
Come on in, bring your bag.

22:09.138 --> 22:11.407
You actually said that, aloud?

22:12.541 --> 22:13.875
It was your idea, all right?

22:13.943 --> 22:15.177
You're the evil one.

22:15.244 --> 22:16.711
I told her that
my family was evil

22:16.778 --> 22:17.980
and you proved it beyond
a shadow of a doubt.

22:18.047 --> 22:19.515
So you just be
gone, evil spirit.

22:19.582 --> 22:20.983
You're a child.

22:21.050 --> 22:22.351
That's what you are.

22:22.418 --> 22:23.986
You're the same child
you were at 10 years old

22:24.053 --> 22:25.454
when you ran away
from Lucy Michaels

22:25.521 --> 22:27.022
'cause she wanted to kiss you.

22:27.089 --> 22:30.492
She had a huge mustache,
all right, even then.

22:30.559 --> 22:32.061
I can't be faulted for that,

22:32.127 --> 22:34.396
because your first kiss
should not be to an otter.

22:34.463 --> 22:36.731
If you want to have
an adult relationship,

22:36.798 --> 22:39.034
you're going to have
to learn to be one.

22:41.003 --> 22:42.071
So you're saying
that horsey rides

22:42.137 --> 22:43.072
and that are out
of the question?

22:43.138 --> 22:44.406
Are you kidding me?

22:46.208 --> 22:49.144
All right, so what about you?

22:49.211 --> 22:50.980
What about me?

22:51.046 --> 22:52.814
Well, you're always
helping me solve my problems.

22:52.881 --> 22:54.016
Let's hear one of yours.

22:54.083 --> 22:56.018
I don't have any problems.

22:56.085 --> 22:58.153
I'm perfectly
happy with my life.

22:59.088 --> 23:00.556
What is wrong with you?

23:00.623 --> 23:04.493
Go, go fix this, go.

23:06.262 --> 23:07.263
So cute.

23:09.064 --> 23:10.499
You know, it's really not nice

23:10.566 --> 23:12.101
to look through someone's
personal belongings

23:12.167 --> 23:13.502
without getting their
permission first.

23:13.569 --> 23:16.605
Ah, well, good thing
I have permission.

23:16.672 --> 23:19.975
Dr. Leaver told me I could
live through anything I wanted.

23:21.143 --> 23:22.844
I really don't like you.

23:24.980 --> 23:29.084
Can I get you a coffee,
tea, or a puke bucket?

23:30.152 --> 23:32.121
You make it hard not
to like you.

23:32.187 --> 23:34.356
I'm very uncomfortable
with that fact.

23:34.423 --> 23:37.259
Hm, then why waste
your time trying?

23:37.326 --> 23:40.229
You have much more important
things to think about.

23:41.330 --> 23:43.465
Shouldn't you be out
chasing boys or something?

23:43.532 --> 23:44.566
It's a Saturday night.

23:44.633 --> 23:45.934
Why would I want to do that?

23:46.001 --> 23:48.803
Sex, obviously.

23:48.870 --> 23:50.506
Isn't it every
American girl's dream

23:50.572 --> 23:54.209
to find some beer-chasing,
swigging Canadian lad?

23:54.276 --> 23:56.278
You do make it
sound intriguing.

23:57.713 --> 23:58.813
Then go.

23:59.682 --> 24:00.549
Really, go ahead.

24:01.183 --> 24:03.252
I can take care of myself.

24:03.319 --> 24:04.987
I'm gay, girl.

24:05.853 --> 24:07.222
And I'm also quite content

24:07.289 --> 24:09.857
to spend the evening
here with you,

24:09.925 --> 24:12.294
'cause I know you're
not feeling well.

24:13.462 --> 24:14.363
Gay?

24:15.698 --> 24:17.299
You're saying you're a lesbian?

24:18.967 --> 24:21.003
Anyway, you can relax.

24:21.070 --> 24:22.671
You're not my type.

24:22.738 --> 24:26.308
I like my girls a little less
uptight and less pregnant.

24:27.209 --> 24:29.011
Going to make you that tea.

24:29.945 --> 24:31.046
Uptight?

24:47.930 --> 24:50.332
Dude, you're up.

24:52.434 --> 24:53.535
About time.

24:53.602 --> 24:56.271
Jesus Christ, how many
pills did they give you?

24:57.039 --> 24:58.140
I don't know.

24:59.274 --> 25:01.877
My name's Geoff with a G,

25:01.944 --> 25:03.278
you know, like Geoff with a J.

25:03.345 --> 25:05.114
Same name, just
spelt differently.

25:05.180 --> 25:06.448
You mind if I uh?

25:08.417 --> 25:09.351
On my bed?

25:14.957 --> 25:16.458
All right.

25:16.525 --> 25:17.693
Thanks, brother.

25:17.760 --> 25:18.761
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:18.827 --> 25:20.162
Watch the open robe there, man.

25:20.229 --> 25:21.830
You don't want to
show the whole world

25:21.897 --> 25:23.599
your tiny little pecker now.

25:23.665 --> 25:24.700
What?

25:24.767 --> 25:26.268
Your dangly little dew worm.

25:26.335 --> 25:28.036
Oh, and you do not want
to go fishing around here.

25:28.103 --> 25:29.571
Trust me.

25:29.638 --> 25:32.207
I mean, you know, one
minute they're hot and 20

25:32.274 --> 25:33.776
and then the next you
want to gnaw your arm off

25:33.842 --> 25:35.277
'cause they're so freaking ugly.

25:35.344 --> 25:38.614
Seriously, if you want
to get laid, not here.

25:39.581 --> 25:42.050
Well, isn't this a
psychiatric hospital?

25:43.285 --> 25:46.422
Are you trying to throw me
with your big words, dude?

25:46.488 --> 25:47.823
No, I just-

25:47.891 --> 25:51.260
- I mean, I've been knocked
over and over and over and over.

25:51.326 --> 25:52.694
- And over?
- Exactly.

25:52.761 --> 25:54.463
So you get where I'm
coming from, right?

25:54.530 --> 25:55.397
We're relatable.

25:56.098 --> 25:57.533
How long you played football?

25:58.500 --> 25:59.468
I never have.

25:59.535 --> 26:00.602
Yeah, I figured.

26:00.669 --> 26:02.571
You smell like a
bit of a fruit bar.

26:02.638 --> 26:04.239
I played though, man.

26:04.306 --> 26:07.409
NFL, CFL, the NFL
in Europe thing.

26:07.476 --> 26:09.913
They have football over
there, American kind?

26:09.978 --> 26:11.413
Well that remains to be seen.

26:11.480 --> 26:14.183
But most importantly is
they rocked my noodle

26:14.249 --> 26:15.651
while I was trying to play.

26:15.717 --> 26:17.553
And then, you know,
that's why I'm in here.

26:19.755 --> 26:21.223
How long you been laid up?

26:21.290 --> 26:23.425
Man, you are the
inquisitive type, aren't you?

26:26.061 --> 26:27.629
I think I'm done
talking for today.

26:28.564 --> 26:29.832
Yeah.

26:29.899 --> 26:32.835
Oh, and just 'cause I
got this mag

26:32.902 --> 26:34.970
doesn't mean I'm going to
be dejuicing the pickle

26:35.037 --> 26:37.473
every 10 minutes,
so you can relax.

26:44.179 --> 26:45.514
You look like you
could use it a hug.

26:47.082 --> 26:48.183
As you were.

26:58.560 --> 27:01.463
Daddy, sit down.

27:02.297 --> 27:03.665
You're making my head hurt.

27:06.335 --> 27:08.337
It was here just a moment ago.

27:09.204 --> 27:10.272
I can't seem to find it.

27:10.339 --> 27:11.740
What are you looking for?

27:11.807 --> 27:13.308
It's not really relevant.

27:13.375 --> 27:15.945
The important thing
is that it's lost.

27:16.011 --> 27:16.913
I can't find it.

27:18.080 --> 27:19.983
Okay, but maybe if you tell
us what you're looking for,

27:20.048 --> 27:21.416
we can help you find it.

27:21.483 --> 27:24.253
Dear, once again,
you missed the point.

27:24.319 --> 27:25.554
Always a point.

27:26.822 --> 27:28.357
Well, I give up.

27:28.423 --> 27:31.260
I guess it will be forever lost.

27:32.127 --> 27:33.128
I must go.

27:33.195 --> 27:34.730
I bid you all a fond adieu.

27:36.265 --> 27:39.268
Ah, Dr. Leaver,
just hang on a second.

27:39.334 --> 27:41.703
Let me fix your
tie for you, huh?

27:44.640 --> 27:45.440
Thank you, Susie.

27:45.507 --> 27:47.442
I wouldn't want to look shoddy.

27:49.378 --> 27:52.347
Oh, there you are.

27:52.414 --> 27:54.483
Not lost anymore.

27:54.550 --> 27:55.450
Good work.

27:59.555 --> 28:00.455
Thank you.

28:01.423 --> 28:03.058
Thank you for doing that.

28:07.429 --> 28:09.131
Daddy, is everything okay?

28:10.365 --> 28:12.801
I hate to believe I'm
in need of assistance,

28:14.803 --> 28:18.540
but I am in need of
assistance, everyone.

28:25.347 --> 28:27.482
Look, I've been
an incredible idiot

28:27.549 --> 28:30.552
and I'm willing to do
anything to make up for it.

28:31.921 --> 28:33.188
I love you. Jack.

28:34.289 --> 28:35.857
I really do.

28:35.925 --> 28:39.795
But maybe two people can
love each other an awful lot

28:39.861 --> 28:42.764
and they're still not
meant to be together.

28:45.567 --> 28:48.203
Well, I don't know that
that's our case, so to speak.

28:48.270 --> 28:52.474
I mean, we were right for each
other last week, were we not?

28:52.541 --> 28:55.711
Sometimes in life you get
those moments of total clarity.

28:56.946 --> 28:58.915
Has that ever happened to you?

28:58.982 --> 29:00.682
- Clarity?
- Yeah.

29:01.650 --> 29:04.152
Yeah, sadly I think
that's one of the things

29:04.219 --> 29:05.922
that's passed me by
in my life, right?

29:05.989 --> 29:09.458
Thus and therefore the reason
why I'm such an abhorrent ass.

29:09.524 --> 29:10.759
You know, what I want to do.

29:10.826 --> 29:12.761
I'm going to move out.

29:12.828 --> 29:15.297
I'm going to go and stay
with my sister for a bit

29:15.364 --> 29:18.667
while we, while I
figure my life out.

29:22.304 --> 29:25.008
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

29:25.074 --> 29:27.944
What about that moment
of clarity we just had?

29:28.011 --> 29:29.611
What about that?

29:29.678 --> 29:33.382
Clarity is what I've had
since the day I met you, Jack,

29:33.448 --> 29:35.517
and wanting to spend the
rest of my life with you.

29:35.584 --> 29:37.786
I've always been
clear about that.

29:37.853 --> 29:39.922
The same clarity
that you're lacking.

29:42.824 --> 29:43.926
I'm sorry, I gotta go.

29:48.196 --> 29:49.631
That was a trick question.

29:49.698 --> 29:51.400
Just because I have a
little bit of gray hair

29:51.466 --> 29:54.636
doesn't mean I don't know
what I'm talking about.

29:54.703 --> 29:55.537
I do.

29:55.604 --> 29:56.838
All right, everyone, I think

29:56.906 --> 29:58.908
we're getting
slightly off track.

29:58.975 --> 30:01.543
Now we have a new member
to introduce to our group.

30:01.610 --> 30:03.645
Everyone say hello to David.

30:07.249 --> 30:08.750
It's a tough group, David,

30:08.817 --> 30:11.420
as I'm sure you
could already tell.

30:11.486 --> 30:14.790
But perhaps you would
like to speak to us a bit

30:14.856 --> 30:17.359
about what you're
experiencing right now.

30:18.560 --> 30:21.430
I'd like to know why he's
got that thing on his head,

30:21.496 --> 30:22.965
if it gets a radio signal?

30:23.032 --> 30:25.233
'Cause he looks like
Princess Leia in "Star Wars."

30:25.300 --> 30:27.569
Geoff, quiet please.

30:29.304 --> 30:31.941
But perhaps, David,
you explain to us

30:32.008 --> 30:33.608
why you have those bandages.

30:36.344 --> 30:40.515
I tried to kill myself, twice.

30:40.582 --> 30:42.718
You
shot your ears off.

30:44.519 --> 30:45.922
What are you, some
kind of an idiot?

30:45.988 --> 30:47.556
Everyone knows if you
want to kill yourself

30:47.622 --> 30:49.959
you just put the
gun under your chin.

30:50.026 --> 30:51.760
No, in the mouth.

30:51.827 --> 30:52.594
That'll get it done.

30:52.661 --> 30:53.963
Blood splatter everywhere.

30:54.030 --> 30:55.397
Guys, stop it.

30:55.464 --> 30:57.699
I'm not looking for
a way to kill myself.

30:57.766 --> 30:58.700
Oh really?

31:01.503 --> 31:02.671
Yes, really.

31:04.873 --> 31:08.410
Well, I think
somebody needs a hug.

31:12.115 --> 31:13.015
Ow.

31:15.584 --> 31:17.153
All right, carry on.

31:17.220 --> 31:19.855
You know I hate church.

31:19.922 --> 31:21.323
I hate church too.

31:21.389 --> 31:23.492
You know, we're both
gonna go to hell.

31:23.558 --> 31:24.526
Can I have a Bible?

31:24.593 --> 31:25.861
Have you got one?

31:25.928 --> 31:27.230
Since when do
you read the Bible?

31:27.295 --> 31:28.497
I read it a lot.

31:28.563 --> 31:29.731
It's very well written.

31:32.400 --> 31:33.735
- Hello, Chester.
- Hi.

31:36.304 --> 31:37.472
Do you come here?

31:37.539 --> 31:39.142
Hello.

31:39.208 --> 31:40.575
You must be Martina.

31:41.476 --> 31:42.477
Marina.

31:42.544 --> 31:44.446
Oh, Marina, yeah, quite right.

31:44.513 --> 31:45.380
My apologies.

31:45.447 --> 31:46.648
My daughter Laurel.

31:46.715 --> 31:48.283
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

31:49.252 --> 31:50.352
She's preggers.

31:51.053 --> 31:52.587
That's Jewish for pregnant.

31:52.654 --> 31:54.056
Without a husband too.

31:54.123 --> 31:55.657
Daddy.

31:55.724 --> 31:57.492
Well, there was a husband
originally, but he left.

31:57.559 --> 31:59.427
Well, kicked her
out to be specific.

31:59.494 --> 32:00.328
Now I'm stuck with her.

32:00.395 --> 32:01.264
Daddy, stop it.

32:01.363 --> 32:02.531
I'm sorry.

32:02.597 --> 32:03.732
Well, what did I say wrong?

32:03.799 --> 32:05.034
- Are you not pregnant?
- Yes.

32:05.101 --> 32:06.601
- Husband left, correct?
- Yes.

32:06.668 --> 32:08.804
You're living with me, right?

32:08.870 --> 32:10.239
I give up.

32:10.305 --> 32:12.707
You see, dear, I am totally
and completely correct.

32:12.774 --> 32:14.977
I do tend to tell it like it is.

32:15.044 --> 32:16.078
You certainly do.

32:16.145 --> 32:18.480
Well, I got to piss.

32:19.381 --> 32:20.782
I'm coming with you.

32:20.849 --> 32:23.886
Yeah, let's drain
those lizards.

32:27.689 --> 32:29.825
An interesting man.

32:29.892 --> 32:30.893
He certainly is.

32:32.295 --> 32:33.628
This is payback
for all the shit

32:33.695 --> 32:34.964
we pulled in high
school, isn't it?

32:35.031 --> 32:35.932
Yep.

32:37.732 --> 32:39.302
They're not coming
back, are they?

32:39.367 --> 32:40.435
Nope.

32:40.502 --> 32:41.803
- Baseball on TV?
- Yep.

32:43.371 --> 32:46.408
And we're alone
in an empty church.

32:46.474 --> 32:47.576
Yep.

32:49.111 --> 32:50.512
You want to get
the hell out of here?

32:50.579 --> 32:54.416
Yes, please.

33:05.861 --> 33:06.761
Looks good.

33:07.596 --> 33:09.098
It's not so much a landscape

33:09.165 --> 33:11.867
as much as it is an imprint
of my emotional state.

33:14.170 --> 33:15.704
What the hell are
you talking about?

33:15.770 --> 33:19.075
It means, it means
I'm feeling better.

33:21.409 --> 33:23.778
Good, I'm glad.

33:23.845 --> 33:24.947
Me too.

33:25.014 --> 33:28.084
So, you still want
to kill yourself?

33:29.285 --> 33:30.953
Not so much kill myself

33:31.020 --> 33:34.489
as much as I want to continue
to take pieces off of my face.

33:34.556 --> 33:36.092
You know, it seems
like such a shame

33:36.158 --> 33:37.759
to stop considering so much
progress had been made.

33:37.826 --> 33:39.628
Good. Well, progress is good.

33:39.694 --> 33:40.897
One day at a time.

33:42.731 --> 33:45.867
Oh, I hear you have
a fun new roomie.

33:45.935 --> 33:47.270
Can I meet him?

33:47.336 --> 33:49.972
You came all this way to
see my roomie and not me?

33:50.039 --> 33:52.841
Don't ask questions you
don't want the answers to.

33:53.808 --> 33:55.912
He's a handful, but
he makes me feel better.

33:55.978 --> 33:58.847
It makes my problems feel
a little bit smaller.

33:59.916 --> 34:01.884
For the record,
they always were.

34:02.952 --> 34:04.853
Who's this?

34:04.921 --> 34:05.787
Oh boy.

34:05.854 --> 34:06.889
Relax, relax, he's harmless.

34:06.956 --> 34:07.656
Oh boy.

34:07.722 --> 34:09.992
Tell it to my ribs.

34:10.059 --> 34:11.293
- Hey.
- Hi, I'm Geoff.

34:11.360 --> 34:13.527
And you have luscious breasts.

34:13.594 --> 34:15.563
Barking up the
wrong tree, buddy.

34:16.232 --> 34:17.166
You like women?

34:17.233 --> 34:18.433
- I do.
- Oh.

34:19.168 --> 34:20.136
What's your favorite?

34:20.202 --> 34:21.270
Geoff, stop it, come on.

34:21.337 --> 34:23.406
No, no, it's fine.

34:23.471 --> 34:25.440
Well, I like older women,

34:25.507 --> 34:27.976
women with experience,
life experience.

34:28.043 --> 34:30.679
Mm, I more meant like
big tits or small tits.

34:30.745 --> 34:32.248
Oh, I'm a butt girl.

34:32.315 --> 34:33.481
Me too.

34:33.547 --> 34:34.516
Big butts or small butts?

34:34.581 --> 34:35.516
Geoff, stop it.

34:36.118 --> 34:37.752
So they've known
each other for decades

34:37.819 --> 34:40.222
but never bothered to
introduce the families.

34:40.289 --> 34:41.290
How peculiar.

34:41.357 --> 34:43.725
Well, not unusual for my dad.

34:43.792 --> 34:45.694
I think he's lost it.

34:45.760 --> 34:46.795
Alzheimer's warning.

34:46.860 --> 34:48.197
I was thinking that,

34:48.264 --> 34:50.831
but he's always been
a little eccentric.

34:52.101 --> 34:53.034
But I am worried.

34:53.101 --> 34:54.235
What if he's not okay?

34:54.303 --> 34:55.870
What about his patients?

34:55.938 --> 34:59.308
What if he sticks an ear on
wrong or something silly?

34:59.375 --> 35:02.644
Come on, he seemed fine to me.

35:02.711 --> 35:04.947
But maybe you should stay close,

35:05.014 --> 35:07.216
keep your eye on him,
see for yourself.

35:08.351 --> 35:10.886
I suppose I could spy
on him a little bit.

35:10.953 --> 35:12.787
It is a daughter's
duty after all.

35:12.854 --> 35:14.390
Well maybe spying is
too harsh of a word.

35:14.457 --> 35:17.259
Constant supervision is
a better way to put it.

35:19.794 --> 35:23.132
And if he invites home
more American hitchhikers?

35:23.199 --> 35:24.166
I'll kill him.

35:31.340 --> 35:33.943
Got your papers right
here for you to both sign.

35:34.010 --> 35:35.677
Thank you.

35:35.744 --> 35:37.046
Your father's left you

35:37.113 --> 35:38.948
as the sole beneficiary
of his estate.

35:39.949 --> 35:42.151
I wouldn't exactly call
it an estate.

35:42.218 --> 35:44.887
Which with real
estate holdings, bonds,

35:44.954 --> 35:47.655
stock, cash in and
out of the country

35:47.722 --> 35:50.525
works out to an estimated
4.5 million dollars.

35:56.065 --> 35:57.333
4 million?

35:57.400 --> 35:58.767
4.5 million.

35:59.734 --> 36:01.003
4.5 million.

36:01.937 --> 36:03.705
- 4.5 million?
- Mm-hm.

36:03.772 --> 36:05.274
I still can't get over it.

36:05.341 --> 36:08.843
I have never seen you
spend a penny on yourself

36:08.911 --> 36:10.913
the entire time I've known you.

36:10.980 --> 36:14.849
In fact, you've never
spent a cent on me either.

36:14.917 --> 36:16.952
Well, you're going to
get it all soon enough.

36:17.019 --> 36:18.888
That is not what I meant.

36:18.954 --> 36:20.389
I just think you should spend

36:20.456 --> 36:22.958
some of that money on yourself.

36:23.025 --> 36:26.761
Take a vacation or something,
do something special.

36:26.828 --> 36:28.097
I thought I was.

36:28.164 --> 36:29.864
Giving it all to
me isn't special.

36:29.932 --> 36:33.102
You need to do something
nice for yourself.

36:33.169 --> 36:34.070
Like what?

36:36.172 --> 36:37.073
A trip.

36:39.808 --> 36:42.311
Trip? I hate
flying, I hate hotels.

36:43.312 --> 36:45.381
Ah, how about our
new checkerboard?

36:45.448 --> 36:49.385
You could buy 4
million checkerboards with that.

36:49.452 --> 36:52.754
Let's try aiming for something
a little more interesting.

36:52.821 --> 36:54.190
I like checkers.

36:54.256 --> 36:55.124
Oh, Dad.

36:55.191 --> 36:55.991
I do.

36:56.058 --> 36:57.893
I'll tell you what, surprise me.

36:57.960 --> 36:59.929
As long as I don't have
to leave this house

36:59.995 --> 37:04.599
for more than a day, we
can do anything you want

37:04.666 --> 37:07.002
and I promise I'll enjoy it.

37:08.603 --> 37:11.040
- Really?
- Really.

37:12.241 --> 37:17.046
You've got to play
me two out of three.

37:18.047 --> 37:19.882
- Two out of three?
- Mm-hm.

37:19.949 --> 37:23.285
So just two games
of checkers then.

37:26.821 --> 37:30.126
Edward, this must
be very tough on you.

37:30.192 --> 37:33.862
Well, I just want to know
what to do, what to expect.

37:34.997 --> 37:36.565
Well, you were all
correct in your assumptions.

37:36.631 --> 37:39.969
You are experiencing the
early stages of Alzheimer's,

37:40.035 --> 37:41.669
but the very early stages.

37:41.736 --> 37:43.272
The long goodbye.

37:44.373 --> 37:46.041
Yes, it is known as that.

37:47.009 --> 37:49.644
There isn't any medication
that I can give you

37:49.711 --> 37:55.117
to stop or reverse the effects
that you are experiencing,

37:56.118 --> 37:57.852
but I can give you
something to treat

37:57.920 --> 37:59.687
the other symptoms of the
disease, such as dementia.

38:00.722 --> 38:04.659
I highly recommend
that you give up

38:04.726 --> 38:07.062
your practice, Edward, and soon.

38:09.331 --> 38:10.665
I believe-

38:10.732 --> 38:13.335
- Oh look, a crawling
pancreatic tumor,

38:13.402 --> 38:15.104
very rare this time of year.

38:15.171 --> 38:16.305
Must follow.

38:21.177 --> 38:23.078
He's probably
having a rough time,

38:23.145 --> 38:27.283
and allowing his
imagination to run wild

38:27.349 --> 38:30.319
allows him to find
some sort of joy.

38:31.753 --> 38:33.522
Or perhaps it's a
defense mechanism,

38:33.589 --> 38:37.159
so not to be so afraid
of what the future holds.

38:39.995 --> 38:41.330
How's the pregnancy going?

38:43.365 --> 38:44.366
So far so good.

38:45.601 --> 38:48.170
But it looks like I'll have
two children on my hands.

38:49.038 --> 38:51.574
Yes, and they're
both going to need

38:51.640 --> 38:53.909
a lot of attention and love.

38:55.244 --> 38:56.178
You'll be fine.

38:58.113 --> 39:00.049
Do you have anyone to help you?

39:03.851 --> 39:05.221
This is all so strange to me.

39:05.287 --> 39:06.555
What is?

39:06.622 --> 39:08.790
Oh no, I'm just a
middle-aged woman babbling.

39:08.856 --> 39:09.959
Oh no, you can talk to me.

39:10.025 --> 39:11.327
What's on your mind?

39:11.393 --> 39:12.895
You're a very
confusing young lady.

39:12.962 --> 39:14.496
I'm not sure what
to do with you.

39:14.563 --> 39:16.265
Confusing, how?

39:16.332 --> 39:18.100
You seem to have
it all figured out.

39:18.167 --> 39:21.303
You have such an understanding
of who and what you are.

39:21.370 --> 39:22.504
I'm in my 40s, pregnant,

39:22.571 --> 39:24.806
with not a whole lot
to look forward to.

39:24.872 --> 39:26.175
How can you say that?

39:27.409 --> 39:31.846
For one thing you're a brave
and beautiful 40 year old.

39:31.914 --> 39:34.149
- 41.
- 41 year old.

39:34.216 --> 39:38.153
And you have this baby coming.

39:38.220 --> 39:40.822
I mean, how crazy is that?

39:41.856 --> 39:45.027
You have an amazing life
and incredible father.

39:46.195 --> 39:48.230
You're just about the
nicest woman I've ever met.

39:50.099 --> 39:52.767
Okay, you're going
to make me blush.

39:52.834 --> 39:56.105
I'm an old hag, a mean old hag.

39:56.171 --> 39:59.608
And I like being one actually,
it's part of my charm.

40:03.279 --> 40:05.247
When did you know you were gay?

40:06.582 --> 40:10.452
Oh, I actually can't
remember not knowing.

40:12.154 --> 40:14.390
But you're so pretty,
and you wear dresses,

40:14.456 --> 40:15.790
and you put makeup on.

40:15.857 --> 40:17.526
Hey, Laurel, being
gay does not dictate

40:17.593 --> 40:20.296
how my hygiene or how I dress.

40:20.362 --> 40:21.463
No, I know.

40:21.530 --> 40:23.599
I was with a woman
once and I thought-

40:23.666 --> 40:29.038
- Look, Laurel, I have enjoyed
spending time with you.

40:31.140 --> 40:32.608
Everything is not sexual.

40:32.675 --> 40:34.710
You don't have to move
every time I touch you.

40:34.777 --> 40:36.445
I'm not trying to hit on you.

40:38.113 --> 40:39.581
That's not why I'm trembling.

40:44.253 --> 40:48.123
Oh wow, that was
such a shitbag thing.

40:48.190 --> 40:49.525
That was a terrible...

40:58.167 --> 41:01.303
All right, if you
do that one more time

41:02.404 --> 41:04.940
you're just going to have
to come to bed with me.

41:07.875 --> 41:08.977
Hello.

41:10.245 --> 41:11.146
Terri?

41:13.382 --> 41:14.283
Hello.

41:16.285 --> 41:19.455
Your asshole of a boyfriend
is here to make amends.

41:48.050 --> 41:50.352
So she's gone?

41:51.887 --> 41:54.022
Every bit of
clothing, everything.

41:56.225 --> 41:58.193
What are you going
to do about it?

41:59.027 --> 42:00.429
Nothing I imagine.

42:01.296 --> 42:03.699
What am I supposed to do?

42:03.766 --> 42:05.901
She wants nothing to do with me.

42:05.968 --> 42:07.102
Oh, I can't imagine
she wouldn't want

42:07.169 --> 42:08.971
to have anything to do with you.

42:09.938 --> 42:11.373
You guys were good together.

42:12.941 --> 42:16.245
You only had one
problem as a couple.

42:16.311 --> 42:17.881
Yeah, what was that?

42:17.946 --> 42:21.083
You, you're an ass.

42:21.750 --> 42:23.051
Yeah, I know.

42:23.118 --> 42:24.787
Not just a little one either.

42:24.853 --> 42:28.657
You big stupid ass asshole.

42:28.724 --> 42:30.959
I know, thank you.

42:31.026 --> 42:32.127
You finished?

42:38.000 --> 42:38.902
Yeah.

42:38.967 --> 42:40.169
I liked the egg salad.

42:41.136 --> 42:43.172
You're getting better at it.

42:43.238 --> 42:44.773
It's from a store, you ass.

42:44.840 --> 42:45.974
It's in a box.

42:47.709 --> 42:50.546
To inappropriately
change the subject,

42:50.612 --> 42:52.948
would you mind taking
me to my checkup?

42:55.384 --> 42:57.152
I'm not allowed
to drive anymore.

42:58.253 --> 43:00.956
You never should have
been allowed to drive.

43:01.023 --> 43:01.990
You're terrible.

43:03.225 --> 43:05.427
Yes, absolutely, I can take you.

43:07.262 --> 43:09.431
I wasn't aware you
couldn't drive anymore.

43:10.232 --> 43:12.334
How long is that going to last?

43:12.401 --> 43:13.802
I have multiple sclerosis.

43:14.770 --> 43:16.238
Physically I'm going
to keep getting worse

43:16.305 --> 43:18.073
and pretty soon
I'm going to die.

43:19.408 --> 43:22.377
You gotta start paying attention
to the world around you

43:22.444 --> 43:24.446
or you're just going to miss it.

43:27.683 --> 43:29.351
Who is going to
take care of you?

43:33.388 --> 43:35.791
You better not get weepy eyed.

43:35.858 --> 43:39.929
I swear if you do, I'm
going to take this cane

43:39.995 --> 43:45.367
and I am going to ram it so
far up your asshole, I promise.

43:48.136 --> 43:49.338
You got it?

43:49.404 --> 43:50.606
- I got it.
- Okay.

44:00.984 --> 44:03.018
Do you want to
get out of here?

44:06.154 --> 44:08.090
Ah, I'm too tired to move.

44:09.725 --> 44:12.227
Can we just sit
here a little bit?

44:16.131 --> 44:17.199
Okay.

44:19.936 --> 44:24.206
Laurel, Laurel.

44:25.140 --> 44:27.242
Darling, Laurel.

44:31.713 --> 44:34.216
Are you up here? Laurel.

44:35.417 --> 44:38.120
Laurel, darling, I
can't for the life of me

44:38.186 --> 44:39.588
find my, lesbian.

44:39.655 --> 44:41.156
Your what?

44:41.223 --> 44:42.324
My lesbian.

44:47.529 --> 44:49.631
No, no, I mean my lesbian.

44:49.698 --> 44:51.166
Oh, I said it again.

44:51.233 --> 44:53.268
I'll be right back.

44:58.574 --> 44:59.708
Who's there?

44:59.775 --> 45:00.676
Dr. Lesbian.

45:00.742 --> 45:02.946
I mean, Dr. Leaver.

45:03.012 --> 45:04.346
Come in, Daddy.

45:07.349 --> 45:10.218
All right, I'm going
to try this again.

45:13.755 --> 45:15.024
My tie.

45:15.090 --> 45:16.592
Have you seen my maroon tie?

45:17.894 --> 45:19.194
Yes, it's in the garbage.

45:19.261 --> 45:20.662
It was horrid.

45:20.729 --> 45:22.164
Right, understood.

45:22.230 --> 45:25.767
What about my yellow tie?

45:28.004 --> 45:29.104
Horrid.

45:33.709 --> 45:36.879
Are there any of my
ties in the house

45:36.946 --> 45:38.513
that you haven't thrown out?

45:38.580 --> 45:41.817
Your red and green tie is
in the closet downstairs.

45:41.884 --> 45:45.587
All right, I'll just
go and pull it out,

45:47.890 --> 45:48.790
out of the closet.

45:51.027 --> 45:52.394
I'm going to leave now.

45:53.495 --> 45:57.432
I trust I'll see both of
you later this evening

45:57.499 --> 45:59.102
at my retirement party?

45:59.167 --> 46:00.402
Of course.

46:00.469 --> 46:02.537
Do you want us to
bring anything?

46:02.604 --> 46:06.608
No, I can see that you
have your hands full.

46:18.820 --> 46:19.956
You seen her?

46:20.023 --> 46:21.289
Have you seen her?

46:21.356 --> 46:22.457
Seen who?

46:23.325 --> 46:24.760
I can't find her.

46:24.826 --> 46:25.627
She's gone.

46:26.762 --> 46:27.562
Find who?

46:27.629 --> 46:28.664
Who are you talking about?

46:28.730 --> 46:29.765
I keep looking,

46:29.831 --> 46:31.400
I've been looking
for a long time

46:31.466 --> 46:33.635
and I can't figure
out where she is, man.

46:34.770 --> 46:35.905
You okay, man?

46:35.972 --> 46:37.006
You want me to call the nurse?

46:37.073 --> 46:38.074
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

46:38.141 --> 46:39.075
They're going to make me forget.

46:39.142 --> 46:39.942
I don't want to forget.

46:40.009 --> 46:41.276
It's right here.

46:41.877 --> 46:44.446
Every morning I wake up and
I smell the same feeling

46:44.513 --> 46:46.615
and they always make me forget.

46:46.682 --> 46:48.383
But why would they do that?

46:49.418 --> 46:51.653
Want me to
help you remember?

46:53.288 --> 46:54.690
- Would you?
- Yeah.

46:59.227 --> 47:00.495
You need a hug?

47:00.562 --> 47:01.730
Not particularly.

47:01.797 --> 47:02.698
All right.

47:19.581 --> 47:20.917
Terri, phone call.

47:20.983 --> 47:22.484
Who is it?

47:22.551 --> 47:24.486
Someone who says that he
will absolutely slit his wrists

47:24.553 --> 47:25.620
if you don't speak to
him right this minute.

47:25.687 --> 47:27.823
Did he give a name?

47:28.790 --> 47:30.993
As in there'd
be more than one?

47:31.060 --> 47:33.361
How many men do you have
willing to slit their wrists?

47:33.428 --> 47:35.697
More than enough actually.

47:36.398 --> 47:38.400
Tell him to bugger off, will ya?

47:38.467 --> 47:41.536
- Seriously.
- Okay.

47:42.237 --> 47:43.906
Yeah, not going to happen.

47:43.973 --> 47:45.874
- Really?
- Yep.

47:45.942 --> 47:46.842
What?

47:47.576 --> 47:49.711
- She said that?
- She did.

47:50.880 --> 47:53.082
And you told her the whole
part about slitting my wrists?

47:53.149 --> 47:56.018
- Yep.
- Oh, very cold.

47:56.085 --> 47:57.220
Good luck with that.

47:57.285 --> 47:58.386
All right, bye.

47:59.922 --> 48:03.492
All right, time for
a new mode of attack.

48:08.663 --> 48:10.599
And that would be game.

48:12.300 --> 48:14.669
Oh, for crying out loud.

48:17.472 --> 48:19.741
I lost again. I know, sadly.

48:20.609 --> 48:23.345
Sadly outclassed.

48:23.411 --> 48:25.014
You are so mean.

48:25.081 --> 48:26.681
Well, I could treat
you like a child

48:26.748 --> 48:28.650
and let you win if you'd like.

48:29.684 --> 48:32.255
Perhaps that's what I'm
doing, letting you win.

48:32.320 --> 48:33.588
Unlikely.

48:33.655 --> 48:34.924
You broke my arm
trying to steal home

48:34.991 --> 48:36.893
in a family baseball game.

48:36.959 --> 48:41.329
When I'm playing catcher,
nobody's steals home on me.

48:42.131 --> 48:44.267
I was six.

48:44.332 --> 48:45.400
So what?

48:46.434 --> 48:47.669
Which
is why you're never

48:47.736 --> 48:49.771
going to beat me
at anything again.

48:52.874 --> 48:53.775
Let's play.

48:57.880 --> 48:59.215
Dr. Leaver.

48:59.282 --> 49:01.483
Hi, just wanted to wish you
well on your retirement.

49:01.550 --> 49:03.652
And I hope you enjoyed
your dinner tonight.

49:03.718 --> 49:05.922
Oh well, thank you,
thank you very much.

49:05.988 --> 49:07.322
You're welcome.

49:07.389 --> 49:09.558
You're looking
awfully white tonight.

49:09.624 --> 49:12.460
Perhaps you could wear
a badge or something.

49:13.896 --> 49:14.763
Pardon me?

49:14.830 --> 49:16.933
Oh, no need to
pardon yourself.

49:16.999 --> 49:19.302
But do yourself a favor
and find an optometrist.

49:19.367 --> 49:21.636
He can help you out with that
colorblindness in no time.

49:21.703 --> 49:22.905
She's the chef, Daddy.

49:22.972 --> 49:24.539
Of course, dear,
but it doesn't

49:24.606 --> 49:26.708
make her any less colorblind.

49:26.775 --> 49:28.978
Dinner is lovely, thank you.

49:29.045 --> 49:32.814
Yeah, sumptuous,
except for the escargot.

49:33.849 --> 49:35.450
It looked an awful
lot like snails.

49:36.852 --> 49:37.752
Oh no.

49:39.721 --> 49:41.991
I will make sure we
do better next time.

49:42.058 --> 49:43.025
Excellent.

49:43.092 --> 49:45.161
And about the lobster. I-

49:45.228 --> 49:46.896
- Daddy, a pancreatic tumor.

49:50.066 --> 49:50.967
Right.

49:53.336 --> 49:54.836
The dinner is lovely.

49:55.837 --> 49:57.472
Why don't you pull up a chair

49:57.539 --> 50:00.910
and join us for a while
until I do my speech.

50:06.715 --> 50:08.084
So let me get this straight.

50:08.150 --> 50:10.785
You have no recommendations
for a costume

50:10.852 --> 50:13.855
for a man trying to win back
the woman of his dreams.

50:14.689 --> 50:16.658
Perhaps a fuzzy bunny.

50:16.725 --> 50:18.860
Girls all like fuzzy bunnies.

50:19.761 --> 50:23.099
Yeah, I'm not sure
that necessarily says

50:23.165 --> 50:24.967
virile young man, you know.

50:25.767 --> 50:27.836
You didn't ask for virile.

50:27.904 --> 50:29.972
You asked for a woman catcher.

50:31.073 --> 50:35.111
Fuzzy bunny costumes
always worked for me.

50:36.745 --> 50:38.915
You've done this
before, Have you?

50:38.981 --> 50:39.748
Of course.

50:39.814 --> 50:41.884
How else do I get laid?

50:45.354 --> 50:48.757
Yeah, still, I think I'm
gonna need something different.

50:48.823 --> 50:50.725
Something that's never
been done before, you know,

50:50.792 --> 50:52.827
something powerful or dynamic.

50:54.931 --> 50:57.300
I think I got just the thing.

51:01.770 --> 51:03.372
First of all, I'd
like to thank you all

51:03.438 --> 51:04.941
for coming tonight.

51:06.541 --> 51:08.510
Hopefully it won't
be the last time

51:08.576 --> 51:11.746
I remember seeing all of you.

51:14.283 --> 51:16.218
To our colorblind chef,

51:16.285 --> 51:18.720
I'd like to thank you
for a delicious meal.

51:18.787 --> 51:22.590
I'd also like to thank Dr. Kelly

51:22.657 --> 51:23.926
for not only being my friend,

51:23.993 --> 51:26.228
but to have the
testicular fortitude

51:26.295 --> 51:31.666
to tell me to quit my job
and become a mindless nitwit.

51:34.370 --> 51:36.671
I'd like to thank Sarah Forkey

51:38.573 --> 51:41.143
for teaching me the
meaning of French

51:41.210 --> 51:46.614
and for knowing that blow is
not just a figure of speech.

51:48.918 --> 51:52.021
Of course, Sarah's not
here right now, but if she-

51:52.088 --> 51:53.055
- Daddy, Daddy.

51:53.122 --> 51:54.957
Was, oh right.

51:55.724 --> 51:56.959
But most importantly,

51:59.462 --> 52:04.766
I'd like to thank my beautiful,
talented daughter Laurel.

52:06.601 --> 52:10.106
Not only is Laurel going to
make me a proud grandfather

52:10.172 --> 52:13.943
in a few months, but she's
also given me the pleasure

52:14.010 --> 52:17.146
of moving in with me while
she learns to be a lesbian.

52:17.213 --> 52:19.714
I'm surprised it took her
this long to figure out.

52:19.781 --> 52:23.052
She didn't have a
boyfriend until she was 20.

52:23.119 --> 52:26.755
And she liked tennis a little
too much for my liking.

52:26.821 --> 52:29.992
Welcome to knowing
who you are, dear.

52:37.166 --> 52:40.535
The truth is, life
is about love.

52:41.703 --> 52:45.874
And no matter what,
there's nothing ever wrong

52:45.941 --> 52:48.144
with loving and being loved.

52:49.178 --> 52:51.780
A man has only two
things in this life

52:51.846 --> 52:53.648
that he ever really needs.

52:53.715 --> 52:55.084
First of all, to be loved.

52:55.151 --> 52:57.053
And secondly, death?

53:00.022 --> 53:01.589
Hello, everyone.

53:01.656 --> 53:02.958
Welcome, death.

53:03.025 --> 53:04.260
Here for dessert, are you?

53:04.326 --> 53:05.528
Excellent, come, sit.

53:05.593 --> 53:07.530
No, I'm here for Terri.

53:08.931 --> 53:10.232
She's a bit young,
don't you think?

53:10.299 --> 53:12.334
Take the old fart in the
corner, why don't ya?

53:12.401 --> 53:14.904
I mean, it'll you
save you a trip later.

53:14.970 --> 53:17.473
No, no,
I'm here for Terri.

53:17.540 --> 53:19.841
Jack, is that you?

53:21.643 --> 53:22.545
Surprise.

53:23.446 --> 53:25.414
Why are you dressed
as the Grim Reaper?

53:26.714 --> 53:32.121
It's my way of saying I'll
die if you don't take me back.

53:33.322 --> 53:34.656
Please take me back.

53:38.360 --> 53:40.795
You dressed up as
death to win me back?

53:42.131 --> 53:43.299
Well, yeah.

53:43.365 --> 53:45.834
I mean, it's probably
not the best costume

53:45.901 --> 53:47.303
I could have picked.

53:47.369 --> 53:48.670
You came to my restaurant,

53:48.736 --> 53:49.972
you interrupted this
man's retirement dinner,

53:50.039 --> 53:52.074
and you're dressed
like this, why?

53:54.910 --> 53:59.915
Because, because I love you.

54:12.627 --> 54:14.696
Hey, what are you doing?

54:14.762 --> 54:16.132
We have to find her tonight.

54:16.198 --> 54:17.832
Why, dude?

54:17.900 --> 54:18.867
You said you'd help me.

54:18.934 --> 54:21.036
- You promised.
- Ssh.

54:21.103 --> 54:22.938
Any idea where we're going.

54:23.005 --> 54:24.273
Absolutely not, no.

54:24.340 --> 54:26.108
But that's never
stopped me before.

54:27.543 --> 54:29.512
All right, let's do it.

54:29.578 --> 54:32.248
Okay. Go, that way.

54:32.314 --> 54:33.215
Okay, go.

54:44.593 --> 54:45.727
Keep going.

55:18.860 --> 55:20.196
Oh, shit, shit, shit.

55:20.262 --> 55:21.163
Hold on.

55:24.066 --> 55:24.900
What are you doing?

55:24.967 --> 55:25.833
Gotta sign out.

55:25.901 --> 55:27.769
We have to sign out.

55:29.238 --> 55:30.172
Go.

55:38.647 --> 55:40.216
Can you see her?

55:40.282 --> 55:41.183
See who?

55:42.284 --> 55:43.452
My angel, man.

55:45.588 --> 55:46.589
You have an angel?

55:47.623 --> 55:51.193
Yeah, the best part
of my life is my angel.

55:52.361 --> 55:53.929
You don't have one?

55:53.996 --> 55:56.198
Oh, everyone should
have an angel.

55:58.601 --> 55:59.501
I don't.

56:01.736 --> 56:02.870
I wish I did.

56:03.706 --> 56:04.974
What's she look like?

56:08.611 --> 56:10.812
See, that's what I'm
trying to remember.

56:12.481 --> 56:15.217
They gave me all these
drugs to make me forget.

56:17.852 --> 56:19.288
I don't want to forget, Dave.

56:21.123 --> 56:22.224
I want to remember.

56:24.759 --> 56:26.761
Some nights she's there

56:26.828 --> 56:32.034
and I reach out to touch
her and she's gone.

56:40.142 --> 56:41.410
Well, I can't
help you find her

56:41.477 --> 56:43.045
if I don't know
what she looks like.

56:48.217 --> 56:50.886
Hey, why'd you
bring me here, man?

57:04.033 --> 57:05.668
You do realize
that I could suspend

57:05.734 --> 57:06.935
your treatment for this.

57:07.002 --> 57:08.337
Yeah, look, he
wanted to leave.

57:08.404 --> 57:09.905
I thought it was best
if I followed him.

57:09.972 --> 57:10.939
No harm was done.

57:11.006 --> 57:13.008
Are you sure about that?

57:13.075 --> 57:16.178
Look, Geoff is a
very special case.

57:16.245 --> 57:17.946
He doesn't need any road trips

57:18.013 --> 57:20.316
beside the water in the
middle of the night.

57:21.283 --> 57:23.952
You could have done some
serious damage to him.

57:24.953 --> 57:26.922
You have all your
faculties intact.

57:26.989 --> 57:28.290
Geoff, on the other hand,

57:29.391 --> 57:33.028
he won't be leaving
here anytime soon.

57:33.095 --> 57:34.296
This is his home.

57:35.164 --> 57:36.465
You must realize this.

57:38.300 --> 57:39.867
Are you saying he
can't get any better?

57:39.935 --> 57:43.172
I thought he just had his head
busted in a football game.

57:43.238 --> 57:45.107
Is that what he told you?

57:45.174 --> 57:50.312
Yeah, he said that Margaret
Thatcher busted his melon.

57:52.314 --> 57:53.882
What else did he tell you?

57:53.949 --> 57:56.585
Well, that he
had his own angel

57:56.652 --> 57:58.620
and he couldn't remember her

57:58.687 --> 58:00.189
because of all the drugs
you guys are giving him.

58:00.255 --> 58:01.290
Look, I know it sounds crazy.

58:01.357 --> 58:03.692
Yes, angel, yes, yes, yes.

58:03.759 --> 58:05.227
Quite tragic indeed.

58:05.294 --> 58:06.328
What if I talked
to his family?

58:06.395 --> 58:07.896
Maybe they can stop all this.

58:08.964 --> 58:12.167
I'm afraid his family won't
be involved in his treatment.

58:12.234 --> 58:13.469
And why not?

58:14.869 --> 58:17.339
Because Geoff's
family is dead.

58:19.675 --> 58:21.543
Geoff never played football.

58:23.946 --> 58:26.648
A number of years back he
took his family ice fishing.

58:26.715 --> 58:31.353
The ice cracked and the wife
and daughter both drowned.

58:33.055 --> 58:34.556
There was nothing he could do.

58:35.791 --> 58:38.927
Eventually he ended up here
after a few stops in between.

58:42.698 --> 58:44.099
You really didn't know?

58:49.204 --> 58:51.673
They found him in the
water searching for them.

58:51.740 --> 58:55.310
They figured he'd been
there for quite a while

58:55.377 --> 58:57.379
before anyone even noticed.

58:58.514 --> 59:00.884
They had to physically
drag him out of the water.

59:00.949 --> 59:02.384
He wouldn't get out.

59:03.218 --> 59:04.720
He should have froze
to death from the cold.

59:04.787 --> 59:07.322
It's a minor miracle.

59:07.389 --> 59:10.092
He was inconsolable,
to say the least.

59:11.560 --> 59:15.330
I believe they had to
literally knock him out cold

59:15.397 --> 59:18.133
to keep him from jumping
back into the water.

59:19.735 --> 59:22.137
So you understand that he cannot

59:22.204 --> 59:24.339
be encouraged to go find them.

59:32.080 --> 59:34.416
Does he know they're dead?

59:36.151 --> 59:37.619
The wife, yes.

59:39.121 --> 59:40.489
I think he grasped that.

59:41.523 --> 59:42.491
His daughter, no.

59:44.560 --> 59:48.197
He was so distraught that when
they told him about the wife,

59:48.263 --> 59:50.866
he became violent
and unmanageable.

59:50.934 --> 59:55.437
We've medicated him enough
to keep him under control.

59:56.371 --> 01:00:01.376
But therapy simply
has not worked so far.

01:00:01.945 --> 01:00:03.045
But we'll keep trying.

01:00:06.215 --> 01:00:07.816
So you guys are medicating him

01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:10.887
to prevent him from
loving too much.

01:00:10.954 --> 01:00:12.754
You no longer
need to be here, David.

01:00:12.821 --> 01:00:14.356
It's time for you to leave.

01:00:14.423 --> 01:00:17.392
I realize that he's
become your friend.

01:00:17.459 --> 01:00:20.429
But you have to trust
me that we're acting

01:00:20.496 --> 01:00:22.731
only with his best
interests in mind.

01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:33.509
I think I know
what I want to do for you.

01:00:33.575 --> 01:00:34.510
Do you?

01:00:34.576 --> 01:00:35.844
That's nice.

01:00:35.912 --> 01:00:37.379
Do you want to know?ú

01:00:38.247 --> 01:00:39.681
Not particularly.

01:00:39.748 --> 01:00:44.019
I'm confident that you'll
tell me eventually.

01:00:45.053 --> 01:00:48.090
And even better yet,
you'll just do it.

01:00:48.790 --> 01:00:49.691
Your move.

01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:56.966
Oh, sorry I said that.

01:01:02.371 --> 01:01:03.505
You gonna be okay?

01:01:07.543 --> 01:01:09.411
You know, I've been
curious about you

01:01:09.478 --> 01:01:11.113
since you came in here.

01:01:11.179 --> 01:01:13.081
Yes, I have, yeah.

01:01:13.883 --> 01:01:15.417
You know why?

01:01:15.484 --> 01:01:17.753
'Cause you don't look
like the suicidal type.

01:01:17.819 --> 01:01:19.321
Not that there's a type
to that sort of thing,

01:01:19.388 --> 01:01:22.658
I suppose, but you don't.

01:01:23.792 --> 01:01:26.461
Life's hard, it's really tough.

01:01:27.496 --> 01:01:29.131
Some days you think you
got the tiger by the tail

01:01:29.197 --> 01:01:30.832
when all along it's got you.

01:01:33.368 --> 01:01:34.536
What do you mean?

01:01:35.370 --> 01:01:38.106
Well, it's like
this, you know,

01:01:38.173 --> 01:01:41.543
like everybody has
their tiger, right?

01:01:43.111 --> 01:01:46.748
It's a ghost that
lives inside us.

01:01:46.815 --> 01:01:48.517
It's that monster
that chases you

01:01:48.584 --> 01:01:51.219
through your dreams at
night and won't let you go,

01:01:51.286 --> 01:01:53.188
always trying to catch ya.

01:01:53.255 --> 01:01:55.557
But here's the
thing, it's not real.

01:01:56.625 --> 01:01:58.527
No, it's only real
if you let it be.

01:01:59.561 --> 01:02:03.332
But it's hard not
to because it stirs

01:02:03.398 --> 01:02:04.666
everything up in here, right?

01:02:04.733 --> 01:02:06.535
It's all the couldas
and shouldas and wouldas

01:02:06.602 --> 01:02:08.637
and why didn't I, and why did I.

01:02:08.704 --> 01:02:11.206
It's always tearing
and ripping at ya.

01:02:13.241 --> 01:02:16.411
But it's not real.

01:02:17.379 --> 01:02:19.414
You know what John
F. Kennedy said?

01:02:19.481 --> 01:02:24.686
John F. Kennedy said, "Those
people who foolishly ride

01:02:25.554 --> 01:02:26.956
"the back of the tiger for power

01:02:27.023 --> 01:02:29.291
"eventually end up inside it."

01:02:31.627 --> 01:02:34.296
Now that may not
mean much to you,

01:02:34.363 --> 01:02:36.065
but it means an awful lot to me,

01:02:36.131 --> 01:02:38.101
because I took it to mean

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:41.503
that if you try to
control the tiger,

01:02:41.570 --> 01:02:43.605
it'll eventually eat you alive.

01:02:46.909 --> 01:02:48.143
But here's the thing.

01:02:50.712 --> 01:02:51.780
The tiger is life.

01:02:53.615 --> 01:02:54.516
It's life.

01:02:55.517 --> 01:02:59.154
You know, it's beautiful,
it's fearsome, and strong.

01:03:00.822 --> 01:03:02.290
It's good and it's bad.

01:03:04.027 --> 01:03:04.927
It's everything.

01:03:06.461 --> 01:03:08.263
So enjoy the beauty of it

01:03:09.899 --> 01:03:13.635
in all its complexity
and trouble, fear.

01:03:19.875 --> 01:03:22.644
And if you can do that,

01:03:24.479 --> 01:03:26.648
then life will get
a whole lot easier.

01:03:28.283 --> 01:03:29.384
Yes it will.

01:03:32.688 --> 01:03:37.392
Melvin, you lost me
a bit at the JFK part,

01:03:37.459 --> 01:03:40.429
but that last part made sense.

01:03:40.495 --> 01:03:42.364
I feel like I feel better.

01:03:42.431 --> 01:03:43.732
Why are you still in here?

01:03:45.467 --> 01:03:47.536
I guess I just
like watching tigers.

01:03:57.646 --> 01:03:58.680
Merry Christmas to you.

01:03:58.747 --> 01:03:59.982
- You're late.
- Yeah.

01:04:01.084 --> 01:04:02.551
Grab one of these.

01:04:02.617 --> 01:04:04.252
Are you feeling better?

01:04:05.054 --> 01:04:06.455
Ah, day one, you know.

01:04:06.521 --> 01:04:09.357
Oh, nothing like being
a family at Christmas.

01:04:10.692 --> 01:04:13.762
I only have two
rules in this house

01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:17.866
and I'll expect you to abide
by both of them at all times.

01:04:17.934 --> 01:04:19.601
Yes, sir, I understand.

01:04:19.668 --> 01:04:20.970
First of all,
there's no shooting

01:04:21.037 --> 01:04:23.039
your ears off in the house.

01:04:23.106 --> 01:04:24.473
Outside on the walkway is fine,

01:04:24.539 --> 01:04:26.775
but there'll be no
bleeding ear cavities

01:04:26.842 --> 01:04:28.677
in the pantry or
in the living room.

01:04:28.744 --> 01:04:33.648
I've taken the liberty of
making some signs in places

01:04:33.715 --> 01:04:36.418
for you to shoot your ears
off and where you shouldn't.

01:04:36.485 --> 01:04:40.223
This sign I believe
is self-explanatory.

01:04:40.288 --> 01:04:41.556
I designed it myself.

01:04:41.623 --> 01:04:44.559
And this sign is
designed to let you

01:04:44.626 --> 01:04:46.661
shoot yourself as
much as you please.

01:04:46.728 --> 01:04:48.497
I don't think you
have to worry about me-

01:04:48.563 --> 01:04:51.000
- Shooting your ears off again.

01:04:53.502 --> 01:04:58.406
I thought I told you
not to do that in here.

01:04:58.473 --> 01:05:00.342
Oh, let's start again.

01:05:01.043 --> 01:05:02.511
No, sorry, Dr. Leaver.

01:05:02.577 --> 01:05:04.279
I won't do it again, I promise.

01:05:04.346 --> 01:05:05.580
What was the second thing?

01:05:05.647 --> 01:05:07.616
Oh, the second thing.

01:05:07.682 --> 01:05:10.685
There'll be absolutely no
sleeping with the lesbians.

01:05:10.752 --> 01:05:12.989
Not that I think
you have a chance.

01:05:13.055 --> 01:05:14.589
You've got a penis, boy.

01:05:14.656 --> 01:05:16.525
What good would that
do you with a lesbian

01:05:16.591 --> 01:05:17.859
for crying out loud?

01:05:17.927 --> 01:05:19.494
That's like bringing
a samurai sword

01:05:19.561 --> 01:05:21.363
to a jello eating contest.

01:05:22.497 --> 01:05:24.866
Lesbians don't want pepperoni.

01:05:24.934 --> 01:05:26.301
They want peaches.

01:05:27.869 --> 01:05:29.504
Least you can do is
leave your sword at home

01:05:29.571 --> 01:05:31.773
and not be disturbing
their jello.

01:05:33.308 --> 01:05:35.744
Yeah, you are enormous.

01:05:37.546 --> 01:05:38.547
You're not helping.

01:05:38.613 --> 01:05:41.250
Gigantic, monstrous even.

01:05:41.316 --> 01:05:42.885
How the hell did
you get that on?

01:05:42.952 --> 01:05:45.787
I'm not sure the physics
of it are even possible.

01:05:46.655 --> 01:05:48.824
Messing with a
seriously pregnant woman

01:05:48.891 --> 01:05:51.093
might not be healthy
for your wellbeing.

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:52.828
I think you look great.

01:05:53.963 --> 01:05:54.997
I'm a pregnant dyke.

01:05:56.232 --> 01:05:58.466
I wish I didn't have to
go to this thing tonight.

01:05:58.533 --> 01:06:00.635
I don't feel very feminine.

01:06:01.469 --> 01:06:02.771
I never do.

01:06:02.838 --> 01:06:05.574
You have curves in
all the wrong places

01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:08.677
and now they're just
much, much larger.

01:06:10.645 --> 01:06:13.381
I think you look stunning.

01:06:13.448 --> 01:06:15.885
You're lovely,
and full of shit.

01:06:17.686 --> 01:06:19.922
You look very feminine.

01:06:20.689 --> 01:06:21.891
How could you say that?

01:06:21.958 --> 01:06:24.160
I look more like
Hardy than Laurel.

01:06:24.227 --> 01:06:28.998
Oh, there is nothing more
feminine than a pregnant woman.

01:06:30.199 --> 01:06:32.767
And there is no one more
beautiful than you tonight.

01:06:33.835 --> 01:06:36.638
But feel free to have
that baby anytime

01:06:36.705 --> 01:06:39.808
'cause you're getting
too big for the bed.

01:06:54.891 --> 01:06:55.925
Yes?

01:06:55.992 --> 01:06:58.060
Oh, are you sure
I want to be here?

01:06:58.127 --> 01:07:00.662
You promised that you
were going to be good.

01:07:00.729 --> 01:07:02.731
It's taken me a long time
to plan this thing out.

01:07:02.797 --> 01:07:04.666
Now you're going to go
in and have a good time

01:07:04.733 --> 01:07:06.369
if it kills you or not.

01:07:06.434 --> 01:07:08.703
Well, depending
how long it lasts

01:07:08.770 --> 01:07:11.007
and I have to be here,
it probably will.

01:07:11.073 --> 01:07:13.875
You can stop that
kind of talk right now.

01:07:16.345 --> 01:07:18.180
Will I know anybody?

01:07:18.247 --> 01:07:19.814
Probably not.

01:07:19.882 --> 01:07:21.683
The party is for you, after all.

01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:23.451
Now get in there.

01:07:25.553 --> 01:07:26.355
Okay.

01:07:36.232 --> 01:07:39.668
Where did all these
people come from?

01:07:39.734 --> 01:07:41.137
Did you buy them?

01:07:41.203 --> 01:07:42.405
Everybody's here
because they wanted

01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:44.974
to come celebrate your life.

01:07:45.041 --> 01:07:46.242
Hm.

01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:48.210
Since you are dying
later tonight and all.

01:07:49.245 --> 01:07:50.179
Come on, let's go.

01:07:52.847 --> 01:07:54.016
Go ahead, go ahead.

01:07:54.083 --> 01:07:55.217
Don't wait.

01:07:55.284 --> 01:07:56.651
I'll just tell everyone
you got me drunk

01:07:56.718 --> 01:07:59.754
and left me here alone, okay?

01:07:59.821 --> 01:08:02.657
I'm happy to walk with you,
even if it takes all night.

01:08:02.724 --> 01:08:04.492
And at this pace, it
just might, all right?

01:08:04.559 --> 01:08:08.264
Besides, it's Christmas, and
it's your privilege and duty

01:08:08.331 --> 01:08:09.597
to watch your younger brother

01:08:09.664 --> 01:08:10.865
make a complete
ass of himself, so.

01:08:10.933 --> 01:08:12.168
Oh, just like every year.

01:08:12.234 --> 01:08:13.235
Yes, absolutely.

01:08:15.870 --> 01:08:17.939
On behalf of my
father and myself,

01:08:18.006 --> 01:08:20.076
I'd like to thank you
for coming tonight

01:08:20.142 --> 01:08:24.046
to share both Christmas
Eve and to participate

01:08:24.113 --> 01:08:26.715
in a celebration of
my father's life.

01:08:37.158 --> 01:08:38.394
Mr. Templeton.

01:08:38.461 --> 01:08:39.929
You may not remember
me, but I used

01:08:39.996 --> 01:08:43.032
to play baseball for
you when I was younger.

01:08:43.099 --> 01:08:44.000
Oh.

01:08:44.934 --> 01:08:46.634
You had a saying you
told us before every game

01:08:46.701 --> 01:08:49.604
that if you played your hardest,

01:08:49.671 --> 01:08:51.805
it doesn't matter
if you win or lose

01:08:51.872 --> 01:08:53.808
because in essence
you've already won

01:08:53.875 --> 01:08:55.609
because you've been
true to yourself.

01:08:55.676 --> 01:08:58.913
Thank you for being
a part of my life.

01:08:59.613 --> 01:09:00.983
And to give this to you.

01:09:04.053 --> 01:09:04.987
Thank you.

01:09:13.862 --> 01:09:16.798
- Evening, Chester.
- Evening, sir.

01:09:20.535 --> 01:09:23.005
Oh yes, thank you.

01:09:32.982 --> 01:09:35.017
I wrote this down
because otherwise

01:09:35.084 --> 01:09:36.718
I'd tell you something
about nothing

01:09:36.785 --> 01:09:39.787
and confuse the living
crap out of both of us.

01:09:43.158 --> 01:09:44.591
Dr. Leaver, your note.

01:09:46.395 --> 01:09:47.862
Oh, whoops again.

01:09:52.268 --> 01:09:56.338
Chester, we've been
friends for over 30 years

01:09:56.405 --> 01:09:58.573
and never once had an argument.

01:09:59.874 --> 01:10:03.946
I can honestly say that I
hold no other man's opinion

01:10:04.013 --> 01:10:06.215
in higher regard
than I do yours.

01:10:07.682 --> 01:10:12.888
You are a good
man, a loving man.

01:10:14.190 --> 01:10:18.060
Your impact on my life
has been significant.

01:10:19.361 --> 01:10:23.032
And the memory of you
will stay in my mind long,

01:10:23.099 --> 01:10:26.734
long after the rest of
the shit has fallen out.

01:10:30.705 --> 01:10:31.806
This is for you.

01:10:33.442 --> 01:10:35.544
I believe it's a suppository.

01:10:40.849 --> 01:10:43.986
Thank you for your
life and your spirit.

01:10:47.089 --> 01:10:49.125
Thank you, God bless you.

01:10:52.228 --> 01:10:53.129
I love him.

01:10:54.263 --> 01:10:56.865
Oh.

01:10:56.932 --> 01:10:58.601
I just wanted
to take this time

01:10:58.666 --> 01:11:01.303
to thank our
wonderful chef Terri

01:11:01.370 --> 01:11:05.207
for providing us with an
absolutely delicious dinner.

01:11:09.744 --> 01:11:11.147
And there's someone else here

01:11:11.213 --> 01:11:12.414
who would like to say
a few words to Terri.

01:11:12.481 --> 01:11:13.382
Jack?

01:11:15.951 --> 01:11:17.219
What the hell is going on?

01:11:17.286 --> 01:11:19.288
A last ditch
effort it looks like.

01:11:19.355 --> 01:11:22.391
Just give him a couple of minutes
to say what's on his mind.

01:11:26.061 --> 01:11:28.264
Sorry for interrupting
your dinner.

01:11:28.330 --> 01:11:29.999
Hopefully this
doesn't turn out to be

01:11:30.065 --> 01:11:33.002
one of those horrid stories
from Christmas past.

01:11:33.068 --> 01:11:35.905
And if it does, I'd
like to apologize

01:11:35.971 --> 01:11:38.140
profusely beforehand
for any scarring.

01:11:39.375 --> 01:11:41.776
Several months
ago, I did perhaps

01:11:41.843 --> 01:11:43.546
one of the stupidest
things in my life.

01:11:43.612 --> 01:11:46.615
And considering the mass amount
of stupidity that I've done,

01:11:46.681 --> 01:11:48.284
that's saying an awful lot.

01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:51.153
Something that my sister
can attest to, I'm sure.

01:11:52.288 --> 01:11:55.124
After spitting reindeer
testes at my girlfriend

01:11:55.191 --> 01:11:58.627
I told her that I was planning
a life without children

01:11:58.693 --> 01:12:02.198
and insinuated that I didn't
want to spend my life with her.

01:12:02.264 --> 01:12:04.699
Now I have tried to make up
for it 100 different ways

01:12:04.766 --> 01:12:09.104
from flowers to letters, to
dressing up as a Grim Reaper.

01:12:09.171 --> 01:12:11.006
You know, all of the things

01:12:11.073 --> 01:12:13.008
that men try to do
to woo someone back.

01:12:13.075 --> 01:12:16.145
And to be honest,
I failed miserably.

01:12:16.212 --> 01:12:20.049
I've done nothing more than
embarrass the both of us.

01:12:20.115 --> 01:12:22.717
Now Terri, I have no
more flowers to give

01:12:22.784 --> 01:12:25.187
and I was never
that good at poetry.

01:12:26.322 --> 01:12:28.424
And, to be honest, I don't
think that you'd take me back

01:12:28.490 --> 01:12:31.793
even if I roped the moon and
brought it to your back door.

01:12:33.028 --> 01:12:36.864
But it's Christmas, and
Christmas is about family.

01:12:37.832 --> 01:12:39.801
And I realized how
much I want one

01:12:40.970 --> 01:12:42.471
and how much I
want one with you.

01:12:43.372 --> 01:12:45.873
You asked me before
about clarity

01:12:45.941 --> 01:12:47.842
and I gave you a
terrible answer,

01:12:48.911 --> 01:12:51.213
which wasn't completely untrue.

01:12:52.248 --> 01:12:55.050
Like a lot of things in
my life, I am unclear.

01:12:55.117 --> 01:12:58.587
But the one thing I can
say with upmost certainty

01:12:58.654 --> 01:13:00.822
is that I'm in love with you.

01:13:01.756 --> 01:13:03.825
And if you're willing to spend

01:13:03.892 --> 01:13:05.394
the rest of your life with me,

01:13:06.662 --> 01:13:10.232
I promise to make sure that
you never doubt that again.

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:12.735
You're proposing?

01:13:14.403 --> 01:13:18.240
I wouldn't say
that, unless I would.

01:13:24.413 --> 01:13:27.782
Yeah?

01:13:30.419 --> 01:13:31.853
If I ever would have
know it was that easy,

01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:34.290
I would have done
this months ago.

01:13:34.356 --> 01:13:35.557
Touching.

01:13:36.725 --> 01:13:38.127
It's touching, isn't it?

01:13:39.128 --> 01:13:42.197
I mean, it almost makes
you want to cry just a bit.

01:13:43.932 --> 01:13:45.467
Just don't judge.

01:13:45.534 --> 01:13:47.303
I'm just in touch with my
sensitive side right now.

01:13:47.369 --> 01:13:48.270
It's very.

01:13:49.104 --> 01:13:50.306
I need to leave.

01:13:52.441 --> 01:13:53.342
Leave, why?

01:13:54.276 --> 01:13:56.712
I gotta, I gotta do
something for a friend.

01:13:56.779 --> 01:13:57.980
I just, I gotta go.

01:13:59.148 --> 01:14:00.449
But what about Christmas?

01:14:01.583 --> 01:14:03.585
It's all about family, right?

01:14:03.652 --> 01:14:05.220
It really is.

01:14:05.287 --> 01:14:06.388
And mine is not all here.

01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:12.795
Hey, are you okay?

01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:13.962
I'm not sure.

01:14:15.164 --> 01:14:16.765
What's the matter, dear?

01:14:16.831 --> 01:14:19.068
Oh my God, my water broke.

01:14:20.669 --> 01:14:22.837
Oh, at Christmas,
that's simply absurd.

01:14:22.905 --> 01:14:24.440
I've seen that look before.

01:14:24.506 --> 01:14:26.975
Your mother gave it to me
just before you were born.

01:14:27.042 --> 01:14:28.410
Okay, we need to
get her to a hospital.

01:14:28.477 --> 01:14:30.145
Oh no.

01:14:30.212 --> 01:14:31.580
I think it's coming.

01:14:31.647 --> 01:14:34.016
Shouldn't we let a
doctor decide that?

01:14:34.083 --> 01:14:35.451
- Ah.
- Oh, Daddy.

01:14:35.517 --> 01:14:38.620
No, no, no, you have
at least a few hours

01:14:38.687 --> 01:14:39.722
after the water breaks.

01:14:39.788 --> 01:14:40.823
You're overexaggerating.

01:14:42.424 --> 01:14:44.793
Of course, it might
be a good idea

01:14:44.859 --> 01:14:46.095
to have a doctor look at you.

01:14:46.161 --> 01:14:47.862
Is there a doctor in the house?

01:14:47.930 --> 01:14:49.665
Yeah, you.

01:14:49.732 --> 01:14:50.532
Oh, oh, yes, yes.

01:14:50.599 --> 01:14:52.167
You're right.

01:14:52.234 --> 01:14:55.237
But you do realize, of
course, that I'm retired now.

01:14:55.304 --> 01:14:58.140
Well you still know how to
deliver a baby though, right?

01:14:58.207 --> 01:14:59.508
Of course I do, pumpkin.

01:14:59.575 --> 01:15:01.110
But the question is,
can I do it well?

01:15:01.176 --> 01:15:02.544
Well, you're going to have to.

01:15:02.611 --> 01:15:03.878
I don't want to.

01:15:03.946 --> 01:15:05.314
What do you mean
you don't want to?

01:15:05.381 --> 01:15:07.049
Well, baby delivering
is an awful mess.

01:15:07.116 --> 01:15:08.350
Blood everywhere.

01:15:08.417 --> 01:15:11.120
Large chunks of
flesh flowing out,

01:15:11.186 --> 01:15:12.821
screaming, irrational women.

01:15:12.888 --> 01:15:14.590
Daddy, if you don't
deliver this baby right now,

01:15:14.656 --> 01:15:17.526
you're going to get a
bird's-eye view of my fist.

01:15:17.593 --> 01:15:21.196
You could have
just said please, dear.

01:15:21.263 --> 01:15:22.564
Do you see anything?

01:15:23.966 --> 01:15:25.300
I'm not blind.

01:15:25.367 --> 01:15:27.469
Just mentally incapacitated.

01:15:27.536 --> 01:15:29.204
Of course I can see.

01:15:29.271 --> 01:15:30.372
You're going to be
all right, just breathe.

01:15:30.439 --> 01:15:31.874
You know, just like at class.

01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:33.475
Yeah, yeah,
that's a good idea.

01:15:33.542 --> 01:15:34.743
Keep breathing, dear.

01:15:34.810 --> 01:15:36.678
It helps with the live birth.

01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:40.249
And we can do without
all the noise.

01:15:40.315 --> 01:15:41.683
It makes it very
difficult to concentrate.

01:15:41.750 --> 01:15:43.685
You don't want me
making a mistake now.

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:46.722
I can see you're not going
to be civil about this.

01:15:46.789 --> 01:15:49.658
So let's just push and
get this over with.

01:15:50.826 --> 01:15:53.662
Yeah, the head is coming out.

01:15:53.729 --> 01:15:56.131
It's human.

01:15:56.198 --> 01:15:57.833
Daddy, I swear to God.

01:15:57.901 --> 01:15:59.234
- Oh crunch.
- What, what what?

01:15:59.301 --> 01:16:00.904
There's only half a baby here.

01:16:00.969 --> 01:16:03.005
I've got the head and the torso.

01:16:03.071 --> 01:16:04.640
Nothing else.

01:16:04.706 --> 01:16:06.508
Oh, wait a second.

01:16:06.575 --> 01:16:07.911
I stand corrected.

01:16:07.976 --> 01:16:10.145
It hadn't finished coming out.

01:16:10.212 --> 01:16:11.881
Oh, three quarters of a baby.

01:16:11.947 --> 01:16:13.215
That's much better.

01:16:13.282 --> 01:16:15.184
And no one really
likes half babies.

01:16:15.250 --> 01:16:16.652
At least with a
three quarter baby

01:16:16.718 --> 01:16:19.221
they can wiggle around
on their stumps.

01:16:20.422 --> 01:16:21.423
It's a joke.

01:16:22.524 --> 01:16:25.427
You'd think people would have
a sense of humor at Christmas.

01:16:25.494 --> 01:16:26.896
God.

01:16:26.962 --> 01:16:30.165
Seriously, just one more
push should just about do it.

01:16:30.232 --> 01:16:33.268
One more and all that's
left is the lifelong torment

01:16:33.335 --> 01:16:36.004
of what we call
bringing up a child.

01:16:36.071 --> 01:16:37.606
Ready?

01:16:37.673 --> 01:16:39.909
Your life will never be the
same, tragic as that may sound.

01:16:39.975 --> 01:16:41.443
- Yes, yes.
- Okay, push.

01:16:42.611 --> 01:16:43.545
Yes, yes.

01:16:43.612 --> 01:16:44.413
Okay, you can push.

01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:46.315
Come on, come on, you can do it.

01:16:46.381 --> 01:16:48.650
Come on, that's it,
that's it, that's.

01:16:52.754 --> 01:16:54.456
Is it all right?

01:16:55.624 --> 01:16:58.527
Yeah, no,
no, no, it's fine.

01:16:59.896 --> 01:17:01.129
Here we go.

01:17:02.264 --> 01:17:03.699
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:17:08.905 --> 01:17:10.172
Oh.

01:17:10.239 --> 01:17:11.306
Thank you for
the greatest party.

01:17:11.373 --> 01:17:13.008
Thank you very much.

01:17:15.377 --> 01:17:16.545
Thank you so much.

01:17:16.612 --> 01:17:19.014
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:17:19.883 --> 01:17:21.483
Thank you, sir.

01:17:49.645 --> 01:17:52.214
Are you sure you
want to do this?

01:17:52.281 --> 01:17:53.815
It's going to hurt.

01:17:53.883 --> 01:17:55.584
We can go back any time.

01:17:55.651 --> 01:17:57.586
Hey, man, my
life's full of hurt.

01:17:59.388 --> 01:18:01.356
You said it's going to
answer some questions,

01:18:01.423 --> 01:18:03.592
so yeah, yeah, let's do it.

01:18:10.399 --> 01:18:12.434
Hey, that's my present, right?

01:18:30.285 --> 01:18:32.554
It's my angel.

01:18:33.221 --> 01:18:34.323
You found her.

01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:40.662
That's your wife, Geoff.

01:18:40.729 --> 01:18:41.998
Her name was Julia.

01:18:42.065 --> 01:18:44.000
And your angel
was your daughter.

01:18:44.067 --> 01:18:45.300
- Her name was-
- Angeline.

01:18:45.367 --> 01:18:46.635
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:18:46.702 --> 01:18:47.603
- Geoff.
- No.

01:18:50.305 --> 01:18:52.541
You think because you're
out of the hospital now

01:18:52.608 --> 01:18:54.409
you can cure me, is that it?

01:18:54.476 --> 01:18:55.410
This is your wife.

01:18:55.477 --> 01:18:56.678
This is your daughter.

01:18:56.745 --> 01:18:58.647
Yeah, and they
drowned a few years ago.

01:18:58.714 --> 01:18:59.615
I know.

01:19:02.384 --> 01:19:03.285
You did everything you could.

01:19:03.352 --> 01:19:05.354
No.

01:19:07.789 --> 01:19:12.794
No, I didn't.

01:19:15.965 --> 01:19:17.265
No, I didn't.

01:19:23.072 --> 01:19:25.540
So what, this is
where they live?

01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:35.617
This is where you live.

01:19:38.553 --> 01:19:39.554
They'd want you to be well.

01:19:39.621 --> 01:19:41.189
They'd want you to move on.

01:20:06.082 --> 01:20:07.182
Hi.

01:20:08.483 --> 01:20:10.752
I have a present for you.

01:20:10.819 --> 01:20:11.720
Right.

01:20:12.654 --> 01:20:14.123
What's that?

01:20:14.189 --> 01:20:16.159
I wrote about
our time together.

01:20:16.224 --> 01:20:19.628
And I included passages from
everyone that was here too.

01:20:20.629 --> 01:20:22.631
I was hoping that
you would read it.

01:20:23.598 --> 01:20:26.468
Well, I don't have a
lot of time to read now,

01:20:26.535 --> 01:20:29.471
but I'm sure it's wonderful.

01:20:36.578 --> 01:20:38.747
How about a game then?

01:20:38.814 --> 01:20:39.949
You're on.

01:20:40.016 --> 01:20:44.786
I've got gold pieces,
and you have what?

01:20:47.056 --> 01:20:48.557
Red.

01:20:48.623 --> 01:20:50.093
I hear they're lucky.

01:20:50.159 --> 01:20:51.027
It is.

01:20:51.094 --> 01:20:51.994
Good girl.

01:21:13.983 --> 01:21:15.617
I needed a hug.

01:22:02.932 --> 01:22:03.832
Dad?

01:22:09.671 --> 01:22:10.572
Dad?

01:22:16.711 --> 01:22:19.381
You win one game
of checkers and...

01:22:29.892 --> 01:22:30.792
Oh no, Daddy.

01:22:32.327 --> 01:22:33.428
No, God.

01:22:42.838 --> 01:22:46.808
I'm afraid I had to tape this
bit with the help of Edward,

01:22:48.010 --> 01:22:52.647
specifically, of course, to
tell you that I told you so.

01:22:54.850 --> 01:22:55.885
Stop smiling.

01:22:56.818 --> 01:22:58.820
I'm dead, for crying out loud.

01:23:00.089 --> 01:23:03.025
Dammit, a man should have
tears at a time like this.

01:23:04.927 --> 01:23:07.196
I'm a simple man.

01:23:07.263 --> 01:23:08.597
I tell things simply.

01:23:08.663 --> 01:23:11.499
I just wanted you
to know you were

01:23:11.566 --> 01:23:14.836
my one great compass
throughout my life,

01:23:15.770 --> 01:23:17.739
and I'll see you in 40 years.

01:23:17.806 --> 01:23:21.409
I'll be waiting for
you for the next game.

01:23:23.545 --> 01:23:24.646
And I love you.

01:23:25.847 --> 01:23:28.416
There are two sure
things in life.

01:23:29.352 --> 01:23:30.819
The first is death.

01:23:31.853 --> 01:23:34.789
The second is that you
have the ability in life

01:23:34.856 --> 01:23:38.727
to do anything or be anything,

01:23:38.793 --> 01:23:41.964
and to hope for
anything you want to.

01:23:43.165 --> 01:23:48.403
You'll have tragedy,
but you will find love.

01:23:50.006 --> 01:23:54.176
You will all have a
defining moment in your life

01:23:55.477 --> 01:23:59.481
that will carry with you
till the end of time.

01:24:07.999 --> 01:24:12.999
