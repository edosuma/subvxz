[ Cooing ]

00:06.924 --> 00:08.460
Ooh. She winked at me.

00:08.551 --> 00:11.463
She probably has something in her eye.
Do you have the shopping list?

00:11.554 --> 00:12.919
Yeah. I have the shopping list
right there.

00:13.014 --> 00:15.175
Why do you have to be like that?
She could’ve winked at me.

00:15.266 --> 00:16.756
She’s six weeks old, Booth.

00:16.893 --> 00:19.976
She’s developmentally incapable
of making the decision
to wink at you.

00:20.062 --> 00:21.802
She could be just like you.

00:21.898 --> 00:23.809
You know, brilliant
and... crazy about me.

00:24.817 --> 00:26.557
Hah. Hey,
that was a good one.

00:26.652 --> 00:28.313
[Clicks Tongue]
See that?
Mommy winked too.

00:28.404 --> 00:32.022
Okay. I have packed
extra Onesies, a sweater.

00:32.116 --> 00:35.779
- l have infant sunscreen
if they take her outside.
- Bones, she’s gonna be fine.

00:35.870 --> 00:39.078
Jeffersonian’s got one of
the best day care centers
in the country.

00:39.165 --> 00:41.030
Logically,
I know that’s true.

00:41.125 --> 00:43.457
But for some reason,
I’m still anxious.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.500
You know, because
you’re her mom, right?

00:45.588 --> 00:49.922
It’s her first day at day care
and your first day back at work.
You’re gonna miss her.

00:50.009 --> 00:52.170
Well, I’ll see her
in a few hours.

00:52.261 --> 00:53.967
Do you have
organic baby wipes
on your list?

00:54.055 --> 00:56.296
Yes, l have organic baby wipes.
l have diapers.

00:56.432 --> 00:58.718
Oh, and I got food for us
so we don’t starve.
Good.

00:58.851 --> 01:00.512
Here she is.
Okay. Oh.

01:00.603 --> 01:02.434
[ Fussing]
Hello.

01:07.360 --> 01:08.850
Bones, she’s gonna be fine,
all right?

01:08.945 --> 01:12.187
If you need her,
the lab is really close
to the day care.

01:12.281 --> 01:14.613
I know that.

01:15.826 --> 01:17.953
Oh, did you remember
to wash the nipples?

01:18.037 --> 01:20.449
Yeah, when l showered
this morning. But I don’t think
the day care’s gonna check.

01:22.041 --> 01:24.532
- [ Gasps]
She winked at me!
- [Coos]

01:24.627 --> 01:26.709
[Chuckles]
I think she winked at me.

01:26.796 --> 01:28.878
She’s brilliant,
just like her dad, right?

01:28.965 --> 01:30.375
She’s very advanced.
Like her dad.

01:30.508 --> 01:32.044
I knew she would be.
Yeah, of course.

01:36.180 --> 01:38.011
[Woman ]
You didn’t have to rush us
like that, Walter.

01:38.099 --> 01:40.932
Well, the campground
closes at 8:00.

01:41.018 --> 01:42.883
And if we’re late,
we won’t have
any place to sleep.

01:43.020 --> 01:46.262
[ Scoffs ]
A motel with pay-per-view and WiFi
sounds pretty good to me.

01:46.357 --> 01:49.975
Yeah, the whole point
of this trip is so that we
can all be one with nature.

01:50.069 --> 01:51.934
People stopped
living in the woods
for a reason, Dad.

01:52.029 --> 01:53.485
[Woman ]
Did you remember
the cooler?

01:53.614 --> 01:55.024
Yeah.
And the emergency radio?

01:55.157 --> 01:57.113
And the first—
Yes, yes, yes.
And the first aid kit.

01:57.201 --> 01:58.657
Yes.
[ Chuckles ]

to tie down the luggage, Walter!

if you didn’t nag me!

Don’t—

Oh, God. What did you
run over?

Uh, probably a possum.

I know it’s sad,

but these things happen.

You know, I owe you
a 20-acre thank you,
Dr. Saroyan.

02:44.707 --> 02:48.325
My professor was—
was mighty impressed by
the evaluation you gave me.

02:48.419 --> 02:51.582
Oh. Just telling the truth, Finn.
Are your classes going well?

02:51.672 --> 02:53.628
Well, sometimes
I find myself
lost in the forest.

02:53.716 --> 02:57.550
But as long as no one
walks off and leaves
their campfire burning,

02:57.636 --> 02:59.092
I guess I’ll be okay.

02:59.180 --> 03:01.262
Wow. That was lot of imagery.

03:23.788 --> 03:26.655
Finn has to hitch
the horses to the wagon...

to unearth the—

and really beautiful.

on the interstate.

while removing the remains.

from flipping pancakes now?

looks to have been mashed
into the road or dried in the sun.

Cars must’ve been running over
this guy all night long,
not knowing he was human.

04:32.773 --> 04:35.560
Based on the size
of the femoral head,
the victim is female.

04:35.651 --> 04:37.152
Female.
Just testing you, Bones.

04:37.236 --> 04:40.649

in the day care center.

in child development.

Isn’t she beautiful, huh?
She winks too.

05:01.385 --> 05:04.468
I told the director to send
a photo every half an hour.

05:04.555 --> 05:07.547
- Wow. I didn’t know
they did that.
- They don’t usually.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.142
But I told her,
because of my position,

05:09.226 --> 05:10.727
that I could
have her fired.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.640
Well, everything I’m seeing
points to a hit-and-run.

05:13.731 --> 05:14.937
Hit-and-run.
Not our problem. Nice.

05:15.024 --> 05:17.310
I’m not so sure about that, Booth.
There’s no skull.

05:17.401 --> 05:18.902
You know what?
It probably got knocked off...

05:18.986 --> 05:21.272
by one of the cars
that ran over her
last night.

05:21.363 --> 05:24.821
No. Separation of the disc
from the body of the vertebra...

05:24.909 --> 05:28.902
indicates that
her head was removed
before she was left on the road.

05:28.996 --> 05:31.032
Well, that doesn’t sound
accidental at all.

05:31.123 --> 05:34.786
- I’m gonna take a photo.
- [Shutter Clicks]

05:34.877 --> 05:36.788

should see this right away...

05:36.921 --> 05:39.628
so he can determine what type
of weapon might have caused this.
[ Beeping ]

05:39.715 --> 05:42.627
- Oh. Uh-oh.
- What? Something worse
than her head getting cut off?

05:42.718 --> 05:45.585
I sent the photo
to the day care director.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.716
Ooh. Day one?
Not a good first impression.

05:48.807 --> 05:52.550

- How— Is there
an unsend button?

06:28.222 --> 06:30.053
There are
no kerf marks.

06:30.140 --> 06:32.301
I mean, this lady’s head
wasn’t sliced or sawed off.

06:32.434 --> 06:34.766
Meaning?
It was torn off.

06:34.853 --> 06:36.639
Maybe an animal
killed her.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.231
I mean, these marks
on the bones,

06:38.315 --> 06:39.851
they could be
from claws, right?

06:39.942 --> 06:42.649
Nope. The abrasions
to the fibula and the tibia...

06:42.736 --> 06:44.237
are all in the same
downward direction.

06:44.321 --> 06:46.573
This lady was dragged
along the highway for quite a space.

06:46.699 --> 06:49.441
I’ve seen this before.
Really? A lot?

06:49.535 --> 06:53.027
On the bones of a deer
that was snagged by a pickup
and dragged for a few miles.

06:53.122 --> 06:54.987
I missed so much
growing up in the city.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.822
Have you discovered anything,
Mr. Abernathy?

06:56.917 --> 06:59.533
The abrasions indicate that
the victim was dragged for a stretch.

06:59.628 --> 07:02.244
What dragged her,
I haven’t determined yet.

07:02.339 --> 07:03.795
But based on
the length of her fibula,

07:03.882 --> 07:07.875
I’d say she was anywhere from
154 to 161 centimeters tall.

07:07.970 --> 07:10.006
And taking into account
her gracile form...

07:10.139 --> 07:12.050
and small muscle
attachments—
[ Sniffing ]

07:12.141 --> 07:14.678
I’d say she weighed
approximately 54 kilos.

07:14.768 --> 07:17.885
- Dr. Hodgins?
- Hmm.

07:17.980 --> 07:19.595
Uh, it’s diesel fuel.

07:19.690 --> 07:21.601
- Smell it. Diesel fuel
leaked on her.
- [ Sniffs ]

07:21.692 --> 07:22.852
Ooh.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.649
That could be from
any vehicle that ran over her.

07:24.737 --> 07:26.648
No. It stained the bone.

07:26.739 --> 07:28.320
Staining that deep
would take time.

07:28.407 --> 07:30.819
It probably came from
the vehicle that dragged her.

07:30.909 --> 07:33.036
Look at this. There’s some
kind of oil or grease...

07:33.120 --> 07:35.031
on the back of the victim’s shirt.

by an 18-wheeler.

- Agent Booth.
Do you have a minute?
- No, I don’t.

07:58.562 --> 08:00.894
I don’t have any time.
I got 15 minutes
to get to the store...

08:00.981 --> 08:02.437
before, you know,
my family starves.

08:02.566 --> 08:04.397
Hey, new baby. I got it.
I’ll make it quick.
Okay.

08:04.485 --> 08:06.396
I heard that your victim
was dragged by a semitruck.

08:06.487 --> 08:09.229
There’s a weigh station
half mile ahead of the place
the body was discovered.

08:09.323 --> 08:10.813
Wait a second. Shaw—
[ Scoffs ]

08:10.908 --> 08:12.864
Half mile ahead of the body—
That doesn’t do anything for me.

08:12.951 --> 08:14.407
- No, actually, it does, sir.
- Yeah?

08:14.536 --> 08:15.616
Let me show you.
Okay.

08:15.704 --> 08:17.786
Weigh stations use
weigh-in-motion scales...

08:17.873 --> 08:21.582
embedded in the road
approximately one mile
before the actual station.

08:21.710 --> 08:22.790
[Booth Murmurs]
[Typing]

08:25.047 --> 08:26.628
Right. You’re saying
that the truck...

08:26.715 --> 08:28.671
would’ve crossed over the scale
while dragging the victim.

08:28.759 --> 08:30.966
And it would’ve recorded
the excess weight
of the victim.

08:31.053 --> 08:32.964
And we’d be able to locate
the specific truck.

08:33.097 --> 08:35.509
Yes, sir.
Good work, Shaw. Okay.
I’m gonna go to the store.

08:35.599 --> 08:39.091
While I’m doing that,
I want you to cross-reference
the weights from the two scales.

08:39.186 --> 08:42.895
Well, I did, and
one truck did weigh more
when pulling in to the station,

08:42.981 --> 08:45.313
and I already got
the victim’s weight
from Mr. Abernathy.

08:45.401 --> 08:47.733
Hey, gold star. You win
a chicken dinner. Okay.

08:47.820 --> 08:49.651
I’m gonna go to the store
and get organic baby wipes,

08:49.738 --> 08:51.353
’cause for some reason,
they have to be organic.

08:51.448 --> 08:54.940
There’s less chance of a rash.
Their skin is extra sensitive.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.694
Uh, there’s a truck
that belongs to Fields Market...

08:58.789 --> 09:03.078
that drove over the scale
weighing 122 pounds more than
it did at the weigh station.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.451
It’s the weight of the victim.
That’s the truck.

09:05.546 --> 09:08.037
So the trick is
to track it down
while I’m at the store.

09:08.132 --> 09:10.293
Well, according
to the G.P.S. unit...

09:10.384 --> 09:12.716

his exact location for you.

[ Elevator Bell Chimes]

09:20.477 --> 09:24.095
Huh. Course you do.
There it is. Right there.

09:24.189 --> 09:26.931
I don’t suppose you have
organic baby wipes on you?

09:27.025 --> 09:29.983
No, sir. But, um,
I do have a break coming up.

09:30.112 --> 09:31.727
I could, uh—
That’s really okay,
Shaw.

09:31.822 --> 09:36.111
Uh, just remember me
when you take over the Bureau.
Thanks for that.

09:40.205 --> 09:42.582
[ Hodgins ]
I found more papers in her bra.

09:42.666 --> 09:45.328
Well, these papers

l have no idea what was printed
or written on them.

09:48.172 --> 09:51.005
Must be something important.

09:51.091 --> 09:54.299
Why do you think that?
I mean, you have papers
in your pockets, and so do |.

09:54.386 --> 09:57.173
Yeah, but do you also
stuff papers into your bra?

09:57.264 --> 09:59.050
Not since high school.

09:59.141 --> 10:00.722
She was hiding these, right?

10:00.809 --> 10:03.596
That means
that they’re important.

10:03.687 --> 10:05.598
You know, maybe even secrets.

10:05.689 --> 10:08.271
You think that
this is some kind
of government conspiracy?

10:08.358 --> 10:11.600
Ange, in 1963, the positions
of the Soviet nuclear fleet...

10:11.695 --> 10:13.811
were sewn into the lining
of a hunting cap.

10:13.906 --> 10:15.771
[Angela ]
The video spectral comparator...

10:15.866 --> 10:18.608
should be able to tell us
what was once on here.

10:19.411 --> 10:20.867
[Motor Whirs]

10:23.081 --> 10:24.582
You never know.

10:24.666 --> 10:27.874
I mean, these markings
could be code.

10:28.003 --> 10:30.369
See? Right here.
Yeah.

10:30.464 --> 10:32.625
It’s a UPC. code
on a coupon.

10:32.716 --> 10:35.549
Ten cents off any three-pack
of tapioca pudding.

10:35.636 --> 10:37.922
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

10:38.013 --> 10:41.551
Terrorists are trying to corner
the market on tapioca pudding
and take down America.

10:42.476 --> 10:45.263
You’re mocking me.
You’re quick.

10:45.354 --> 10:47.686
So then why would she
be stuffing coupons
into her bra?

10:47.773 --> 10:49.388
I’m telling you,
it means something.

10:49.483 --> 10:52.941
Yes, honey. It means that
we’re overpaying for pudding.

10:56.073 --> 10:57.779
So you haven’t found
cause of death.

10:57.866 --> 11:01.324
No, ma’am.
Uh, so far, all the trauma
seems to be postmortem.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.697
l have to reconstruct
her skeleton to see
if I can find any trauma...

11:03.789 --> 11:05.279
that might have caused
her demise.

11:05.374 --> 11:06.989
And I’m running tox screens...

11:07.084 --> 11:09.496
to see if there was any
poisoning or drug overdose.

11:09.586 --> 11:12.419
Then I’ll get to piecing
that poor woman back together.

11:14.091 --> 11:16.503
Michelle!
What are you doing here?

11:16.593 --> 11:18.299
I’m dropping off your keys.

11:18.387 --> 11:20.002
Unless you want
to take the bus home.

Well, I’m, uh, very pleased
to meet you, Michelle.

11:33.861 --> 11:36.022
Me too. Cam’s told me
all about you.

11:36.113 --> 11:37.603
She says
you’re quite the star.

11:37.698 --> 11:39.984
Well, that’s ’cause
your mother doesn’t know
any other way but kind.

11:40.075 --> 11:43.112
[ Chuckles ]
I’m not sure
she was kind enough.

11:44.913 --> 11:47.905
I can tell you that picture
she has of you on her desk
ain’t kind enough.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.117
Clearly, they haven’t
invented a camera
that can do right by you.

11:51.211 --> 11:54.294
Oh, my God.
Um— Thank you.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.372
Actually, I just read
that they developed...

11:56.466 --> 11:59.082
an 18-megapixel camera
that’s quite extraordinary.

12:00.554 --> 12:02.385
Don’t you have guts
to play with?

12:02.472 --> 12:05.054
Yes, I do.

12:05.142 --> 12:08.259
And Finn has a skeleton
to reassemble.

12:08.353 --> 12:09.889
You’re right.

12:09.980 --> 12:12.096
For a second there,
you made me forget
the horrors of death.

12:12.190 --> 12:14.772

l’ll walk out with you.

12:14.860 --> 12:17.647
- Uh— You can stay.
- No, no. You’re busy.

12:17.738 --> 12:19.319
I’ll see you at home.

You don’t by any chance
like bluegrass music, do you?

12:24.036 --> 12:27.153
Don’t know it.
Oh, well,
that’s gotta change.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.283

like your insides
are having a party.

This guy here,
the driver of the truck,

12:38.133 --> 12:39.839
has been with Fields Market
for 15 years.

12:39.927 --> 12:43.135
He’s got two priors
for solicitation of a prostitute.

12:43.221 --> 12:45.598
Hey, buddy.
Special Agent Booth, F.B.|.

12:45.682 --> 12:47.343
What’s the deal, man?
I got deliveries to make.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.220
There’s perishables
in there.

12:49.311 --> 12:53.600
Deal is we think this truck
was used to drag a dead body
along the freeway last night.

12:53.690 --> 12:55.681
- That’s a joke, right?
- No, it’s not a joke.

12:55.776 --> 12:58.313

Will you get out of there?

12:58.403 --> 13:01.110
- Let me do that. Come on!
- Flesh and sinew.

13:01.198 --> 13:04.190
This is definitely the vehicle
that dragged the victim.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.866
- That’s great. Let’s get you
out of there so I can—
- No, Booth!

13:06.954 --> 13:09.036
Stop!
I’m looking for evidence.

13:09.122 --> 13:10.828
Let me get you—
Whoa.

qualifies.

And I’m telling you,
l have no idea how that woman
got under my truck.

13:26.974 --> 13:29.511
Hmm. I bet it gets lonely
out on the road, right, Alan?

Nope. Not anymore.

Then your wife might not
be so happy to find
these panties in your truck.

You can’t be
going through there like that.

13:42.364 --> 13:45.151
Don’t you need a warrant?
Not when the door’s
open there, pal.

of bodily fluid in
some of these undergarments.

Okay. Obviously, married or not,

company on the road, huh?

what you guys are up to?

Well, Booth got
a list of all the stops
the trucker made yesterday.

14:47.429 --> 14:49.090
He covered half the state.

14:49.181 --> 14:51.923
If we can determine the type
of pollen our victim inhaled
prior to her death,

14:52.017 --> 14:54.929
we might be able
to actually pinpoint where
the truck picked her up.

14:55.020 --> 14:57.227

to do something together, so—

15:16.833 --> 15:19.415
What do you two know
that I don’t?

with Michelle.

15:28.762 --> 15:31.504
I like him.
I do... like Finn.

15:31.598 --> 15:34.886
But it’s just—
He’s got a somewhat
troubled past.

15:34.976 --> 15:37.433
Yeah, but you were
the one who said
that was all behind him.

15:37.521 --> 15:39.102

caught the victim’s hair
and pulled her in...

16:19.604 --> 16:23.313
and then bore a hole
through her left frontal
and parietal bones.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.732
[ Baby Talk]
Then into her brain,
which caused her death.

16:25.819 --> 16:28.606
Don’t you think this is
a little strange, talking about this
in front of the baby?

16:28.697 --> 16:30.608
I hardly think
she understands, Booth.

16:30.699 --> 16:34.783
The driveshaft on that truck
is three-and-a-quarter feet
off the ground.

16:34.870 --> 16:37.577
To come into contact
with the gears,
she’d have to be crouching.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.450
Why would she be crouching
under a truck?

16:39.541 --> 16:41.281
No. Maybe she was
hiding from someone...

16:41.376 --> 16:44.960
and she accidentally got
her head stuck in the driveshaft
when the truck pulled away.

16:45.046 --> 16:48.334
Then whoever she was hiding from
is responsible for her death.

16:48.425 --> 16:50.336

I’d find you two here.

16:50.427 --> 16:53.544

of the victim’s nasal passage.

So there were spores
of American chestnut
flower pollen in her mucosa,

17:07.569 --> 17:10.402
suggesting that
she spent a lot of time
at an American chestnut farm.

17:10.488 --> 17:12.945
But the only grower in the area
is in Hagerstown.

17:13.033 --> 17:15.866
And how is
our little Christine doing?

17:15.952 --> 17:17.817
Did she have a nice lunch?

17:17.913 --> 17:22.156
She drank approximately
88.75 milliliters of milk,
which means—

17:22.250 --> 17:25.492
I know what that means,
Dr. Brennan. I’ve been caring
for infants for many years.

17:25.587 --> 17:28.670
You struggled
in early childhood nutrition
in graduate school.

17:30.091 --> 17:32.298

She was, uh, discovered
along a quarter-mile stretch
of the interstate.

What do you mean
quarter-mile stretch?

18:22.018 --> 18:23.679

18:24.688 --> 18:26.679
She was dragged
by another vehicle.

18:27.649 --> 18:29.856
Wha— So she was
hit by a car then.

18:29.943 --> 18:31.683
So it wasn’t murder.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.279
Well, the folks
at the Jeffersonian...

18:33.363 --> 18:35.103
believe that she was assaulted
before she was dragged.

18:35.198 --> 18:37.814
We’re convinced
it wasn’t an accident.

18:39.536 --> 18:41.276

lt’sjust, uh—
Can’t— Can’t believe it.

18:45.333 --> 18:49.542
We also found some coupons
that were stuffed in her clothes.

18:50.547 --> 18:52.503
Any idea
why they would be there?

18:52.590 --> 18:53.579

18:55.051 --> 18:56.587
Sure, I do.

19:02.017 --> 19:03.973
Wow. Okay.

or something?

19:06.354 --> 19:07.935

19:09.607 --> 19:11.472
Barb was
an extreme couponer.

19:11.609 --> 19:14.521
What does that mean?
Means her whole life
was about saving money,

19:14.612 --> 19:16.898
whether we had space
for this stuff or not.

19:16.990 --> 19:19.982

Have to do a lot of shopping
to buy all this stuff.

19:20.076 --> 19:22.533
Barb would head out
with a pile of coupons.

19:22.620 --> 19:24.827
Sometimes it’d be days
before I saw her again.

19:24.914 --> 19:28.327
- When was the last time you saw her?
- Last night.

19:28.418 --> 19:31.910
Just before she took off
for Fields Market in Frederick.

19:32.005 --> 19:34.838

double coupon thing
going on.

19:39.971 --> 19:41.802

Are you sure?

19:41.931 --> 19:43.512
You knew her?
Of course.

19:43.600 --> 19:45.886
Yeah, Bargain Barb.
She’s one of my best
customers.

19:45.977 --> 19:51.097
In here at least once a week
with her mounds of coupons,
just clearing my shelves.

Is that a problem for you?
Oh, no, no, no.

for great value...

19:55.945 --> 19:58.357

by the manufacturers.

the extra eight cents

- Sorry. Duty calls.
- Go get ’em, Chad.

20:12.045 --> 20:14.286
Ninety-three coupons.
She jammed my register.

20:14.381 --> 20:17.293
Thatjust means
she knows what she’s doing.
Doesn’t it, Crystal?

20:23.765 --> 20:27.428
- Sorry for the delay.
- She also tried to slip
these expired coupons past me.

20:28.561 --> 20:30.222
Like that’d be possible.

You know you’re not allowed to use
expired coupons, Ms. Carlyle.

20:33.316 --> 20:36.649
- That’ll be three dollars

Those Sunday supplements
can save a bundle.

20:39.280 --> 20:42.238
I found the missing
pieces of the skull
in the parking lot.

20:42.325 --> 20:44.111
The victim
definitely died here.

20:44.202 --> 20:47.239
What? Barb died
in my parking lot?

Yeah, sure.

20:56.297 --> 20:57.798
I’m sure this is nothing.

20:57.882 --> 21:00.794
I mean, Crystal’s been
working here since before
carrots were a juice.

21:00.885 --> 21:03.922
But, um, this was last night.

21:04.013 --> 21:07.050
[No Audible Dialogue]

21:17.610 --> 21:19.225
I think we need to talk
to Crystal.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.060
Yeah, that’s a good idea.

21:25.160 --> 21:27.651
I can see you suffer
from carpal tunnel syndrome...

21:27.745 --> 21:31.704
as a result of the repetitive
circular motion required
while scanning coupons.

21:31.791 --> 21:34.498
- That must be very painful.
- I manage.

21:34.627 --> 21:37.835
Your wrists must’ve been killing you
by the time Barb rolled in
at the end of the night. Right?

21:37.922 --> 21:40.504
And her back.
Standing all day at her age...

21:40.592 --> 21:43.299
would cause pinching of the nerves
in the lumbar region.

21:43.386 --> 21:46.219
My age?
What the hell’s that
supposed to mean?

21:46.306 --> 21:49.389
After Chad broke up the fight,
you and Barb—
Did you take it outside?

21:49.476 --> 21:52.343
No. I counted out my drawer
while Chad cleaned up the mess.

21:52.437 --> 21:56.726
The security camera
shows you left your register
for almost five minutes.

21:56.816 --> 22:01.025
Well, I had to tinkle.
That happens a lot
in women my age.

22:01.112 --> 22:02.943
You really don’t care
that Barb is dead, do you?

22:03.031 --> 22:06.489
- She ruined my life with
her stupid couponing club.
- What do you mean?

22:06.576 --> 22:08.066
She sent in
all her couponing freaks...

22:08.161 --> 22:09.867
and told ’em
to use my checkout line.

22:09.954 --> 22:12.240
Why you? I’m sure there are
more pleasant cashiers.

22:12.332 --> 22:14.163
But there ain’t anyone
faster than me.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.832
Those cheap S.O.B.’s
would do anything
to get a deal.

22:16.920 --> 22:19.127
I’d bet
that includes murder.

22:19.214 --> 22:20.704
I’d talk to her friends.

22:25.428 --> 22:27.885
So I hacked into
the victim’s e-mail account...

22:27.972 --> 22:30.930
and found some e-mail chains
about her couponing club.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.803
Look at this.

22:32.894 --> 22:38.764
“Clipped 200 coupons last night.”
“Saved $242 this week alone.”

22:38.858 --> 22:41.144
And there’s a ton of these
from her club buddies.

22:41.236 --> 22:43.568
Extreme couponing
is an addiction like any other.

22:43.655 --> 22:46.613
Yeah, well, no wonder Booth thinks
that one of them killed her.

22:46.699 --> 22:49.736
It looks like Barb got into
a fight over coupons...

22:49.827 --> 22:51.692
with someone who called herself
the Deal Diva.

22:51.788 --> 22:55.076
Well, Barb
put those coupons
in her bra.

22:55.166 --> 22:58.374
Maybe she was
trying to protect them
from the Deal Diva.

22:58.461 --> 23:01.203
Or maybe the coupons
actually belonged to the Diva.

23:01.297 --> 23:04.630
Look at this. “If! see you looking
through my stuff again, bitch,

23:04.717 --> 23:07.709

of your first

23:40.295 --> 23:44.208
I loved it. The crowd
wasn’t at all what I thought.
I was expecting more—

Why will you be
a sun-soaked bat?

this poor woman was
struck in the head
before that truck killed her.

under the truck.

caused this?

The forensic accountant compared
Rhonda’s receipts with Barb’s

30:54.937 --> 30:56.928
So Rhonda’s alibi holds.

with the Federal Bureau of Investigation,

that matters here,

for special treatment.

did note that, uh,

31:54.121 --> 31:55.736
Barb and her husband
have a joint credit card.

31:55.831 --> 31:57.537
So? Most couples do.

31:57.625 --> 31:59.456
Yeah, but the receipts
that he checked...

31:59.543 --> 32:03.411
showed four separate occasions
last month, while Barb was shopping,

32:03.506 --> 32:06.623
their credit card was also being used
in high-end restaurants around town.

32:06.717 --> 32:10.084
So he’s out fine dining
while she’s pinching pennies.

32:10.179 --> 32:12.795
Yeah. And judging by
the amounts that he was charging,

reconstructing the victim’s
shattered frontal bone.

32:20.397 --> 32:22.649
Looks like the abrasion
we found below the hole...

32:22.733 --> 32:24.769
is actually just the bottom
of a larger wound.

32:24.860 --> 32:26.441
Whatever caused the abrasion...

32:26.529 --> 32:30.772
also appears to have
chipped off a portion of bone
near the top of the wound.

32:30.866 --> 32:33.118
Okay. Well,
I’ll have Dr. Hodgins
take another swab.

32:33.202 --> 32:34.692
We might have better luck
this time around,

three times the wound
to work with.

32:37.206 --> 32:40.994
That may not be necessary,
Mr. Abernathy.

32:41.085 --> 32:46.830

a metal fragment of some sort
embedded in the wound.

33:04.233 --> 33:06.064
Have Dr. Hodgins
examine the fragment.

33:06.152 --> 33:08.188
He should be able to determine
what type of metal it is.

Well, with all due respect
to Thurston, I know my metals.

33:11.073 --> 33:13.109

No. No, I can’t.

41:49.841 --> 41:52.093
I— I’m needed.
You know—

41:53.220 --> 41:56.428
What I do
is for her now too.

41:56.515 --> 42:00.428
She should know
that what I do is important.

42:01.561 --> 42:03.017
I know.

42:03.105 --> 42:04.845
And just because
something is difficult...

42:04.940 --> 42:07.306
doesn’t mean
that I shouldn’t do it.

42:09.027 --> 42:12.690
Look. I’m here for you
and for her, okay?

42:12.781 --> 42:15.443
Anything you need.
We’ll go slow on this.

42:15.534 --> 42:18.992
Okay. I’m going to sneak her
into the lab.

42:19.121 --> 42:22.158
Every day.
You’re a good mom.

42:22.290 --> 42:24.451
Isn’t she a good mommy?
Don’t wake her up.

42:24.543 --> 42:26.829
[Whispering] I’m not
gonna wake her up.
You’re too loud.

43:04.583 --> 43:05.993
What’s that mean?
