No, sorry, Mum.

01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:07.480
Layla wanted to pick something up from Croydon.

01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:09.320
We're riding on the bus.

01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:11.640
<i>Oh, all right. Don't you worry.</i> <i>I'll find someone.</i>

01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:14.680
<i>You have a nice time and say hi</i> <i>to Layla for me.</i>

01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:17.120
Mum, if you don't find someone, you call me back, okay?

01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:19.440
<i>-Aw, thanks darling.</i> -All right. Bye, Mum.

01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:21.080
Bye.

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:24.880
We could do this another day

01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:26.440

01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:28.360
Nah, it's cool, man.

01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:32.880
I mean, we can go back to Brixton.

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:35.040
It's fine. We're nearly there, anyway.

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:37.920

01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:54.880
If that's Troy, you don't pick up.

01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:57.360
Yeah, I'm not. Okay?

01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:03.320
