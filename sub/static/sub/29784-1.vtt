WEBVTT

01:12.625 --> 01:13.833
Where go you, my friend?

01:17.666 --> 01:19.458
You're crawling in the wrong direction.

01:23.083 --> 01:25.583
That wind you feel is coming from England.

01:28.583 --> 01:29.666
Scotland's that way.

02:56.500 --> 02:57.500
My lords.

02:59.041 --> 03:01.125
I'm most sorry for making you wait.

03:02.333 --> 03:05.291
I know you've traveled far
and from great travail.

03:05.583 --> 03:08.333
I pray you will know
that this time of civil unrest...

03:09.416 --> 03:10.708
consumes me...

03:11.583 --> 03:13.750
day and night.

03:20.375 --> 03:21.541
I understand...

03:22.500 --> 03:25.125
battle with the rebel Scots
was hard fought.

03:27.625 --> 03:29.166
It was, my liege.

03:29.250 --> 03:32.000
-We lost some 300 men.

03:44.416 --> 03:45.625
-Amen.
- Amen.

03:52.083 --> 03:53.083
Good Hotspur...

03:54.416 --> 03:55.458
you led the charge.

03:55.541 --> 03:57.208
Were any prisoners of note taken?

03:58.666 --> 03:59.500
Many.

03:59.791 --> 04:01.333
-Are they in train?
-No.

04:05.916 --> 04:08.958
And why is that? Why have they not been
brought to me directly?

04:09.041 --> 04:11.291
Why will you not pay
cousin Mortimer's ransom?

04:13.375 --> 04:15.458
You'll need to speak up, my boy.

04:16.375 --> 04:17.625
I'm an old man.

04:18.041 --> 04:19.166
My ears...

04:19.916 --> 04:21.041
are filled with hair.

04:21.125 --> 04:23.625
Cousin Mortimer is held
by the rebels of Wales.

04:24.291 --> 04:26.125
Why do you refuse to pay his ransom?

04:31.458 --> 04:33.125
I refuse to pay Mortimer's ransom

04:33.208 --> 04:34.833
because I refuse
to believe him a prisoner.

04:34.916 --> 04:37.041
I rather believe Mortimer a traitor.

04:37.791 --> 04:39.500
He has joined the Welsh rebels.

04:39.958 --> 04:42.916
He has betrayed England
and is now an enemy of mine,

04:43.000 --> 04:44.750
and, therefore, of yours.

04:46.458 --> 04:48.833
You agree with my <i>pr√©cis, </i>young Hotspur?

04:50.916 --> 04:52.083
-No.
- My son--

04:52.166 --> 04:54.333
I believe yours to be the ramblings
of a crazy old demon.

04:54.416 --> 04:55.916
Harry, please, stop this.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.916
Oh, no, let him speak.

04:58.625 --> 05:01.041
-I wish to hear him.
- My liege--

05:01.125 --> 05:05.000
Yours are the ramblings of an old man
so saturated with malice and mistrust

05:05.083 --> 05:06.750
that he no longer knows up from down,

05:07.333 --> 05:10.500
can no longer see beyond the walls
of his own monstrous <i>schloss.</i>

05:11.500 --> 05:13.041
My family have served you.

05:13.458 --> 05:15.750
We aided you in your ascension,
and still we fight for you.

05:15.833 --> 05:17.208
Cousin Mortimer has fought for you.

05:17.666 --> 05:20.291
And yet, now, whilst you slobber
over that chicken's wing,

05:20.375 --> 05:21.708
he shivers in a western prison

05:21.791 --> 05:24.083
awaiting mutilation
at the hands of Welsh witches.

05:24.166 --> 05:25.583
My liege...

05:26.208 --> 05:28.333
you must excuse my son.

05:29.125 --> 05:30.208
He needs rest.

05:30.875 --> 05:33.291
We come only...

05:34.166 --> 05:37.291
to advocate for your help
in securing Mortimer's release.

05:37.375 --> 05:39.875
All that we've done for you
we have done for the good of England.

05:39.958 --> 05:43.041
But our lands are now
more riven with war than ever before.

05:43.125 --> 05:45.333
The Scots aren't finished.
The Welsh have only just begun.

05:45.416 --> 05:46.458
And for what?

05:47.625 --> 05:50.291
Why do you think this might be, old man?

05:50.666 --> 05:52.916
Who do you imagine
might be to blame for this?

06:02.833 --> 06:04.458
Chickens can't fly.

06:07.833 --> 06:08.916
But I've seen one...

06:10.291 --> 06:12.458
eke enough wing flap to clear a fence.

06:14.833 --> 06:15.875
Then it's free.

06:19.791 --> 06:21.666
But then so too are the foxes.

06:31.958 --> 06:34.875
You are right, young Percy.
I owe you much.

06:35.291 --> 06:37.083
I owe your family still more.

06:38.458 --> 06:40.583
But if the Scottish traitors
you've taken prisoner

06:40.666 --> 06:43.625
are not brought to me
as speedily as they might travel,

06:44.791 --> 06:47.166
I will hang you by your fucking neck.

06:50.416 --> 06:52.416
Has this been heard, young Percy?

07:00.958 --> 07:04.791
Your Majesty, please forgive us.

07:13.958 --> 07:15.416
What a venomous boy.

07:16.666 --> 07:18.708
He'll betray me now. I'm sure of it.

07:22.916 --> 07:24.625
If only he were my son.

07:29.583 --> 07:30.666
Hal.

07:30.750 --> 07:31.666
Mm.

07:34.375 --> 07:35.250
Hal?

07:38.208 --> 07:39.041
Hal.

07:43.500 --> 07:44.958
-What is it?

07:45.041 --> 07:46.583
Falstaff has injured hisself.

07:46.666 --> 07:47.833
Yeah. See?

07:48.375 --> 07:50.666
-How did you get inside?
- The door was ajar.

07:50.750 --> 07:51.625
It was not.

07:51.708 --> 07:53.375
Yes, it was. It was ajar.

07:53.458 --> 07:54.500
It was not ajar.

07:54.583 --> 07:56.666
Well, how else might we gain entry?

07:57.083 --> 08:00.166
Are you accusing me
of having cut myself a secret key?

08:00.250 --> 08:01.083
Yes.

08:01.166 --> 08:04.333
Falstaff has injured hisself, Hal.
Will you perform the small repairs?

08:04.666 --> 08:05.541
No.

08:06.833 --> 08:07.750
Oh, no.

08:09.750 --> 08:10.750
Your Highness.

08:17.125 --> 08:19.791
There's a fresh coin
in this for you, you know.

08:19.875 --> 08:21.375
I don't want your coin.

08:21.458 --> 08:24.625
I will require your undiminished loyalty
from here till Megiddo.

08:25.125 --> 08:26.458
You have that already.

08:27.208 --> 08:28.791
You're a soft negotiator.

08:30.875 --> 08:33.666
Hey! You're wasting good wine.

08:33.750 --> 08:35.458
-I'm keeping it clean.
-Give it.

08:36.083 --> 08:39.000
Oh. That looks very hot.

08:46.166 --> 08:47.041
Do it.

08:48.875 --> 08:49.708
Ow!

09:17.250 --> 09:18.125
Prince Henry.

09:19.875 --> 09:20.708
Who are you?

09:20.791 --> 09:23.833
We come from the royal court.
We wish to speak with you privately.

09:23.916 --> 09:24.750
For what?

09:25.041 --> 09:26.791
Please, sire. Privately.

09:26.875 --> 09:29.000
Oh, privately, in the middle of Eastcheap?

09:29.375 --> 09:32.458
Should I make a quick up and down
and request a mass covering of ears?

09:32.541 --> 09:33.416
Please, sire.

09:40.541 --> 09:41.500
What is this?

09:41.791 --> 09:43.625
Your father, His Majesty King--

09:45.708 --> 09:48.541
Your father,
His Majesty King Henry, is ill.

09:49.166 --> 09:50.708
He requests your presence.

09:52.291 --> 09:55.250
Hmm. I suggest you return
to the palace directly

09:55.333 --> 09:57.625
and tell him his request
was wholly ignored.

09:58.166 --> 10:01.083
I've been instructed
to deliver the request with great urgency.

10:01.166 --> 10:04.125
You might tell him the urgency
was also wholly ignored.

11:15.625 --> 11:16.583
My lady.

11:16.666 --> 11:18.458
My lady, it's time to leave.

11:18.541 --> 11:19.916
-Why?

11:20.666 --> 11:22.375
The day has begun. See?

11:22.458 --> 11:23.916
-Out there.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.291
It is well underway.

11:26.041 --> 11:27.500
-You might miss it.

11:29.208 --> 11:31.458
Get up now. It's important that you leave.

11:32.208 --> 11:33.833
-Up. That's the spirit.

11:35.250 --> 11:36.458
Right.

11:37.583 --> 11:38.750
Now, lift your arms.

11:39.666 --> 11:40.625
Very good.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.583
You must get that door fixed.

11:51.125 --> 11:52.041
What is it?

11:55.833 --> 11:57.041
Visit with your father.

11:59.416 --> 12:00.291
Go away.

12:03.000 --> 12:04.291
If your father is indeed

12:04.375 --> 12:06.750
gravely ill enough
to request your presence,

12:06.833 --> 12:08.333
then you must visit with him.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.541
It should be better to regret
having done so than it would to have not.

12:13.625 --> 12:14.875
If your father is ill,

12:15.750 --> 12:18.583
no matter your feelings for him,
you must visit with him.

12:19.875 --> 12:20.875
But...

12:21.666 --> 12:24.916
I say this not out of concern
for our king's well-being,

12:25.000 --> 12:28.875
but more for fear of the drunken soak
to which you'll be likely to succumb

12:28.958 --> 12:32.000
should you fail to heed his call
and he were to die

12:32.083 --> 12:34.333
without you having squared your ledger.

12:37.833 --> 12:41.666
I fear that would be soak enough
to put even me to shame.

12:45.083 --> 12:45.916
Do it.

12:46.708 --> 12:48.708
If nothing else I ever suggest.

13:06.791 --> 13:10.000
While I see the strain
your treasury is under,

13:10.583 --> 13:13.208
I cannot help but wonder
if the canker of Lollardy

13:13.291 --> 13:17.125
be at the root of this suggestion
that the church be burdened with a tax

13:17.541 --> 13:20.250
to relieve problems
that are not of the church's making.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.500
Your Majesty.

13:22.583 --> 13:24.416
Henry, Prince of Wales.

13:33.708 --> 13:35.125
My son.

13:35.208 --> 13:36.125
Come in.

14:06.041 --> 14:09.958
I feel my life nearing its natural end,
and yet, still...

14:11.500 --> 14:15.250
even I must appear
of ruder health than you.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.708
The time has come for us to consider...

14:22.166 --> 14:23.208
the issue of...

14:25.291 --> 14:26.375
my succession.

14:30.083 --> 14:31.500
You will not be king.

14:33.541 --> 14:35.458
While you are my eldest son,

14:36.625 --> 14:40.666
for reasons that are on display
for all here to see,

14:40.750 --> 14:41.708
smell...

14:43.791 --> 14:46.041
you will not inherit this crown.

14:46.125 --> 14:47.375
Nor have I sought it.

14:50.250 --> 14:53.416
That privilege and responsibility

14:53.500 --> 14:56.166
will instead fall to your brother Thomas.

14:57.708 --> 15:01.208
He is soft, but he is eager.

15:02.791 --> 15:06.708
He will lead my army
against the newly treasonous Harry Percy.

15:08.375 --> 15:13.666
I will assume that this news comes
as neither surprise nor disappointment.

15:14.625 --> 15:18.083
But it is my duty as king,

15:18.583 --> 15:19.708
and father...

15:22.083 --> 15:23.791
to say it to you directly.

15:28.750 --> 15:29.791
When do you fight?

15:31.750 --> 15:32.916
I set off tomorrow.

15:34.666 --> 15:36.208
We fight by week's end.

15:36.291 --> 15:37.500
You need not fight.

15:38.375 --> 15:40.250
These feuds need not be yours.

15:41.500 --> 15:42.958
I have said...

15:43.916 --> 15:45.708
what you were summonsed to hear.

15:49.250 --> 15:50.458
Leave us now.

16:11.416 --> 16:13.208
-Your Highness.
-Stop.

16:19.958 --> 16:22.041
-Your Highness.
-Stop.

16:43.500 --> 16:44.416
Move it!

16:48.458 --> 16:49.625
Lord Dorset.

16:54.125 --> 16:55.708
Are your men ready for the day?

16:57.625 --> 16:58.791
They are, sire.

16:59.375 --> 17:00.291
Very good.

17:02.666 --> 17:04.625
Tell me of your preparations.

17:07.208 --> 17:08.041
My lord.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.166
Why are you here?

17:23.958 --> 17:26.083
I will not allow this havoc to transpire.

17:26.583 --> 17:27.833
I've come to see it stopped.

17:28.333 --> 17:30.083
This is my battle.

17:30.625 --> 17:32.708
If I have my way, there will be no battle.

17:33.416 --> 17:34.375
You. Come here.

17:34.833 --> 17:37.208
- My lord.
-You have no place here.

17:39.375 --> 17:40.250
Go to the rebel camp,

17:40.333 --> 17:42.666
deliver the following message
to Percy Hotspur.

17:43.125 --> 17:46.416
Tell him that Prince Henry challenges him
to settle today's score man on man.

17:46.500 --> 17:47.375
He and I.

17:49.708 --> 17:51.541
We will fight in our armies' places.

17:52.583 --> 17:53.500
Yes, my lord.

17:54.375 --> 17:55.708
Who do you think you are?

17:59.125 --> 18:00.375
I am nobody to you.

18:01.791 --> 18:02.875
I will fight him.

18:03.958 --> 18:05.125
And I will defeat him.

18:05.916 --> 18:07.500
That you surely would, my son.

18:08.291 --> 18:09.916
But it cannot be.

18:10.291 --> 18:12.625
The prince speaks not for his father.

18:14.416 --> 18:16.791
You are eager to fight, my son.

18:19.291 --> 18:20.291
And you will.

18:21.708 --> 18:24.416
And we shall fight alongside you.

18:26.958 --> 18:28.416
We will burn them.

18:29.791 --> 18:32.750
We will burn Henry's reign to the ground.

18:33.791 --> 18:37.000
- You have no place here.
-You do not know war, Thomas.

18:37.083 --> 18:38.583
-I do know war.
- You do not.

18:39.750 --> 18:42.500
You've been recruited
to our father's madness,

18:42.583 --> 18:44.750
to wars that need not be fought.

18:45.166 --> 18:47.083
These men are not our enemies.

18:47.583 --> 18:50.875
-Our father has made them thus.
- Why then are you here?

18:51.416 --> 18:53.000
You so disapprove of our cause,

18:53.083 --> 18:57.333
and yet, still, you find it necessary
to upstage me.

18:57.416 --> 18:59.708
I do this not to steal your thunder,
brother.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.333
I do it to save your life.

19:01.666 --> 19:02.666
Pardon me, my lords.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.333
Our herald is returned
from the rebel camp.

19:07.416 --> 19:09.625
They have refused Prince Henry's offer.

19:10.791 --> 19:11.833
They want battle.

19:25.791 --> 19:26.916
Whoa, whoa.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.458
-Ha!

19:39.583 --> 19:40.833
-Ha! Go!

20:05.041 --> 20:06.083
Where is Henry?

20:06.791 --> 20:08.500
I come to fight him in our armies' stead.

20:09.041 --> 20:09.875
No.

20:10.791 --> 20:12.708
His offer was refused.

20:13.166 --> 20:14.875
The offer has been reconsidered.

20:14.958 --> 20:15.916
I said...

20:16.875 --> 20:17.708
no!

20:25.625 --> 20:27.166
Why is the little dog barking?

20:28.166 --> 20:29.625
-Hm?

20:30.500 --> 20:32.208
Where be the big dog?

20:33.083 --> 20:34.083
It will be done.

20:42.333 --> 20:44.625
And here I am with the whoring fool.

20:44.708 --> 20:46.458
This fight need not be had, Percy.

20:47.375 --> 20:50.166
My father will soon be dead.
Your grievances will die with him.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.625
Don't be afraid of our small contest,
young Hal.

20:53.708 --> 20:55.291
I promise to finish it quickly.

20:57.666 --> 20:58.500
Come on.

21:33.208 --> 21:34.208
Your father...

21:34.958 --> 21:36.500
is plague to England.

21:46.708 --> 21:48.916
Come for me, big dog!

22:41.416 --> 22:42.375
No!

22:42.916 --> 22:44.208
Oh! Oh!

24:36.333 --> 24:38.125
Hmm.

24:53.375 --> 24:56.250
Someday this will be your head,
dropped at the feet of a man

24:56.333 --> 24:58.375
who might otherwise
have been your brother.

25:00.291 --> 25:01.958
Come with me now, Thomas, please.

25:02.291 --> 25:03.625
Walk away from this field.

25:05.625 --> 25:07.708
After you have stolen its prized scalp?

25:10.916 --> 25:14.291
This is what will be spoken of tomorrow.

25:21.166 --> 25:22.750
This field was mine.

25:24.500 --> 25:26.250
It was to mark my dominion.

25:29.416 --> 25:30.458
Instead now...

25:31.166 --> 25:32.666
it marks only this head.

25:35.333 --> 25:37.750
This fucking head!

25:41.250 --> 25:42.250
Move.

25:52.583 --> 25:54.000
- John.

25:54.791 --> 25:55.791
John.

25:55.875 --> 25:57.083
Go away.

25:57.166 --> 26:00.791
You might want to see
to your otherwise well-appointed friend.

26:02.583 --> 26:04.958
He seems to have taken a pitiful turn.

26:10.666 --> 26:11.583
Beale.

26:12.791 --> 26:14.041
Hal's up-chucked again.

26:23.833 --> 26:24.875
Hello, friend.

26:27.625 --> 26:30.416
Many times have I seen men in your state.

26:31.875 --> 26:34.291
I've been in it many times over myself.

26:37.625 --> 26:39.666
For all our rejoice of...

26:40.250 --> 26:42.208
courage and valor,

26:43.708 --> 26:47.000
nothing stains the soul more indelibly
than killing.

26:51.416 --> 26:53.666
Never have I felt so vile...

26:54.333 --> 26:57.125
than standing victorious on a battlefield.

27:01.333 --> 27:04.750
The thrill of victory fades quickly.

27:07.041 --> 27:09.125
What lingers long after...

27:09.958 --> 27:11.375
is always ugly.

27:15.833 --> 27:17.291
Never again, I say.

27:17.666 --> 27:20.000
Stop talking, old man, please.

27:21.875 --> 27:23.375
Please stop talking.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.750
I will never stop talking, Hal.

27:30.875 --> 27:31.750
Never.

27:36.625 --> 27:37.708
Never ever.

27:52.125 --> 27:53.000
Out.

28:30.625 --> 28:31.625
My lord.

28:34.333 --> 28:35.583
What business?

28:35.666 --> 28:37.791
It is a matter of great urgency.

28:38.833 --> 28:41.083
Mm. You should hurry along then.

28:43.708 --> 28:44.750
Please, my lord.

28:45.208 --> 28:46.375
It is your father.

28:48.375 --> 28:49.416
He's dying.

28:51.708 --> 28:54.375
Hmm, that hook has lost its worm.

29:01.291 --> 29:02.458
Wait outside.

29:24.458 --> 29:25.500
No doubt...

29:26.541 --> 29:28.208
your father has brought...

29:29.458 --> 29:31.708
much trouble to this kingdom,

29:35.083 --> 29:39.208
and I fear the chaos
that might erupt in his absence.

29:41.750 --> 29:42.875
England needs a king,

29:42.958 --> 29:45.750
and I suspect those sentiments of yours

29:46.791 --> 29:48.291
that had you resile from him

29:48.375 --> 29:52.666
are precisely those
the governance of this land needs.

29:56.416 --> 29:58.000
You must be king.

30:00.208 --> 30:01.708
Why do you say this to me?

30:02.583 --> 30:03.708
Speak to Thomas.

30:04.916 --> 30:06.583
Is he not to be your new king?

30:09.083 --> 30:11.041
I'm afraid that is not possible.

30:13.958 --> 30:16.750
Your brother was killed in Wales.

30:18.125 --> 30:20.416
After your defeat of Percy Hotspur,

30:21.750 --> 30:25.125
young Thomas pressed on
to the western fields.

30:26.583 --> 30:28.250
This is where he met his end.

30:32.708 --> 30:36.375
It is said he gave
valiant account of himself.

31:08.875 --> 31:10.125
Where is he?!

31:10.791 --> 31:12.625
Where is the monster?!

31:19.958 --> 31:21.208
Where is the monster?

31:25.958 --> 31:26.791
Move. Leave him.

31:27.250 --> 31:28.500
The King needs rest.

31:28.583 --> 31:30.666
-Soon he will have it.
-He's dying.

31:31.875 --> 31:32.833
Leave.

32:03.333 --> 32:04.916
You feel this cold?

32:06.750 --> 32:07.750
-Wretch.

32:16.583 --> 32:17.750
Hal.

32:18.916 --> 32:19.875
Hal.

32:20.541 --> 32:23.708
You must be king, Hal.

32:27.583 --> 32:28.541
Please.

32:30.375 --> 32:32.916
You must be king, Hal.

32:45.166 --> 32:46.708
I know not what I have done.

33:24.416 --> 33:26.291
You know not what will become of you.

33:30.375 --> 33:31.875
So, I offer you this...

33:34.500 --> 33:36.250
The most blessed reprieve,

33:39.250 --> 33:40.916
the most dreadful misery.

33:44.041 --> 33:46.583
You shall suffer the indignity
of serving me,

33:48.958 --> 33:51.083
the wayward son you so revile.

33:55.916 --> 33:59.541
But know now you will be watched over
by an altogether different king.

34:36.166 --> 34:37.333
What is this?

34:37.708 --> 34:38.708
Who are you?

34:39.541 --> 34:40.583
I am I.

34:41.666 --> 34:42.666
Who are you?

34:42.750 --> 34:44.541
What is your purpose here?

34:46.083 --> 34:48.500
I think you just woke me up from it,
didn't you?

34:48.916 --> 34:50.666
Rise from that bed at once.

34:53.250 --> 34:54.291
Who are you?

34:55.500 --> 34:56.958
Where is Hal?

34:57.416 --> 35:00.666
These lodgings and their contents
are the property of the King of England.

35:01.208 --> 35:04.791
You are trespassing
and I order you to vacate at once.

35:07.125 --> 35:08.458
What King of England?

36:05.750 --> 36:06.625
Amen.

36:10.041 --> 36:12.166
All hail King Henry.

36:12.458 --> 36:14.250
King Henry!

36:14.333 --> 36:15.791
King Henry!

36:15.875 --> 36:17.583
King Henry!

36:19.708 --> 36:21.750
King Wenceslaus of Bohemia

36:21.833 --> 36:24.291
presents this gift
to King Henry of England.

36:24.583 --> 36:26.083
To long and good health.

36:29.625 --> 36:30.458
Beautiful.

36:35.208 --> 36:36.458
I'm sure you all know...

36:37.375 --> 36:39.916
my young sister Philippa
has joined us here today.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.083
Queen of Denmark.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.166
I'm thankful she and her husband,

36:45.125 --> 36:47.375
the good King Eric,
have traveled all this way.

36:47.875 --> 36:50.250
I wish for you take this vase, my dear.

36:51.666 --> 36:55.666
Let its beauty stand for your beauty,
which stands in turn for England's beauty.

36:56.208 --> 36:57.500
I thank you, my lord.

36:58.791 --> 37:02.958
His Serenity,
the doge of the Republic of Venice,

37:03.250 --> 37:05.291
present this gift in your honor, my liege.

37:06.083 --> 37:09.875
-It says it is a bird from Constantinople.
- A bird?

37:09.958 --> 37:11.458
A dead one, I should suppose.

37:19.416 --> 37:21.500
If I may, my liege.

37:28.125 --> 37:32.500
Unnatural mechanics
from the edge of Christendom.

37:47.208 --> 37:48.041
Hmm.

37:53.333 --> 37:54.541
A wonder.

37:57.458 --> 37:59.375
This belongs to my cousin, Cambridge.

38:02.041 --> 38:03.125
Of all at this table,

38:03.916 --> 38:06.000
none have I known longer than I have you.

38:06.791 --> 38:09.916
Indeed I have known you longer
than I have my own young sister.

38:11.208 --> 38:14.375
We were raised together.
You're like an older brother to me.

38:14.833 --> 38:17.958
So, I think it only fitting
that you should have this magical bird.

38:18.416 --> 38:21.083
Let's hope its magic
isn't black and unholy.

38:24.833 --> 38:26.250
From the Dauphin,

38:26.333 --> 38:28.916
son of His Majesty, Charles,
King of France.

38:45.833 --> 38:46.708
A ball.

38:51.583 --> 38:54.041
There is no accompanying message
from the Dauphin?

38:54.708 --> 38:55.666
No, my liege.

39:08.333 --> 39:09.708
I shall keep this gift.

39:12.958 --> 39:14.458
This one is sent only for me.

39:18.333 --> 39:20.083
For the boy I once was.

39:29.791 --> 39:33.583
The ball is an insult to you
and to your kingdom.

39:35.083 --> 39:36.541
You must respond.

39:38.166 --> 39:41.666
Remember where, as prince, I whiled
and how I spent my days?

39:41.750 --> 39:44.458
You spent them
in considered privation.

39:45.666 --> 39:47.208
Drinking, clowning.

39:48.250 --> 39:50.541
So, is there not some truth in this jest?

39:51.041 --> 39:54.208
If the Dauphin wants from me a paroxysm,
why give it him?

39:55.750 --> 39:58.791
It would not be a show of foul temper

39:58.875 --> 40:02.166
for you to respond forcefully
to an insult such as that.

40:03.500 --> 40:05.083
It would be a show of strength.

40:05.166 --> 40:07.041
I appreciate your umbrage, William,

40:07.458 --> 40:08.708
but my strength does not lie

40:08.791 --> 40:11.375
in me flapping up and down
at the slightest barb like...

40:12.041 --> 40:14.250
-some unholy mechanical bird.
-Mm.

40:16.666 --> 40:19.208
Make sense of this.
This is what is pressing.

40:21.291 --> 40:24.125
Civil strife has consumed us.

40:25.708 --> 40:28.375
The war drains the purse like little else.

40:29.250 --> 40:30.583
This strife must end.

40:31.708 --> 40:32.916
And it will end...

40:33.000 --> 40:34.208
by conciliation.

40:34.875 --> 40:36.541
We shall pardon our adversaries.

40:37.083 --> 40:40.583
And we shall pay Mortimer's ransom
and have him returned from Wales.

40:42.125 --> 40:44.291
I will write these pardons
in mine own hand.

40:44.750 --> 40:47.500
I want it known these sentiments
are so personal to me.

40:49.916 --> 40:53.458
We shall let these men know
they were my father's enemies, not mine.

40:54.833 --> 40:56.416
Certainly, my liege.

41:00.500 --> 41:02.208
How does this strategy greet you?

41:02.708 --> 41:06.208
Great reforms are best enacted
with regime change.

41:07.625 --> 41:09.916
If this is how you wish to proceed,

41:10.000 --> 41:11.333
then, yes, my liege,

41:12.125 --> 41:13.666
now is the time to do it.

41:34.500 --> 41:37.458
Did you reconcile with our father
before his death?

41:38.458 --> 41:40.375
There was no reconciliation to be had.

41:41.375 --> 41:43.708
He did untold harm to this kingdom.

41:44.583 --> 41:46.458
His death will bring calm with it.

41:46.958 --> 41:48.958
I ask not after the kingdom.

41:50.166 --> 41:51.000
What of you?

41:52.791 --> 41:54.416
I want an end to this unrest.

42:00.208 --> 42:02.208
Look around that table last night.

42:03.666 --> 42:06.500
Look at the faces
of the men seated at it.

42:07.375 --> 42:09.833
I can feel this calm of which you speak.

42:11.625 --> 42:13.416
I do believe they wish you well.

42:15.541 --> 42:20.125
But I also see that they have
their own kingdoms behind their eyes.

42:22.166 --> 42:23.750
Do you understand what I say?

42:26.333 --> 42:29.750
I've been away too many years
and I'm now to return to Denmark.

42:30.458 --> 42:34.875
But I have, in my time in that court,
been privy to its commissions.

42:35.500 --> 42:39.458
I have seen there, again and again,
that no one ever speaks true,

42:39.541 --> 42:40.500
wholly true.

42:44.916 --> 42:46.958
Choose your steps wisely,

42:47.791 --> 42:48.750
dear brother.

42:52.041 --> 42:53.916
I speak
to Charles of France's claim

42:54.000 --> 42:57.333
to be the legitimate sovereign ruler
of said lands.

42:57.416 --> 43:02.083
It is said that the Salic law
would have no succession

43:02.541 --> 43:04.875
if the French crown fall to a woman.

43:04.958 --> 43:08.583
Meaning, no rule
left in the lineage of the female

43:08.666 --> 43:11.166
shall, by rights, pass to her issue.

43:11.250 --> 43:15.583
Now, the law Salic,
which is of Frankish land

43:15.666 --> 43:18.083
and tethered to said lands is not--

43:18.375 --> 43:23.208
not therefore legally bound
or adherent at all, in fact,

43:23.291 --> 43:25.833
to the lands of France,
but to those of Francia,

43:25.916 --> 43:28.875
which, as you know,
lies between the rivers of Elbe and Saale.

43:28.958 --> 43:32.958
I claim here, with proof,
that hence it follows that the law Salic,

43:33.041 --> 43:37.416
which has seen French sovereignty stolen
as such from a true lineage--

43:37.500 --> 43:41.416
Thrice, as I can illuminate,
the French have cited the law Salic

43:41.500 --> 43:44.250
-as reason to bar a female succession--
-With reverence.

43:46.125 --> 43:46.958
Yes, my liege?

43:47.333 --> 43:49.541
I'm finding this story
impossible to follow.

43:51.416 --> 43:55.500
My liege, I question
the so-called French king's claim

43:55.583 --> 43:57.666
to the throne upon which he sits.

43:58.125 --> 43:59.125
Is that so?

44:00.125 --> 44:03.000
What confuses me now
is why you are telling me this story.

44:04.958 --> 44:08.125
My liege, I simply aim to bolster
your claim to France

44:08.208 --> 44:10.708
should the need to meet her with force
soon arise.

44:10.791 --> 44:13.208
And you believe that need
will indeed soon arise?

44:13.291 --> 44:14.625
I--

44:15.041 --> 44:15.916
My liege...

44:16.833 --> 44:18.541
by way of preparedness,

44:18.875 --> 44:21.083
-I believe it always wise--
-Preparedness?

44:21.166 --> 44:23.583
If we are to war with France,
it will not come as a consequence

44:23.666 --> 44:25.500
of an old and impenetrable madrigal.

44:28.625 --> 44:31.333
France was your father's
long-held ambition.

44:32.083 --> 44:34.666
Had he not been bogged in civil feud,

44:35.333 --> 44:37.750
he would most surely
have taken the fight to her.

44:38.625 --> 44:39.458
And then...

44:40.083 --> 44:41.250
on to Jerusalem.

44:41.333 --> 44:42.208
Jerusalem?

44:44.458 --> 44:46.708
We're all the way to the Holy Land,
are we?

44:46.791 --> 44:50.666
And presumably to sack
the rest of Christendom along the way.

44:52.541 --> 44:54.750
I am not my father, archbishop.

44:56.458 --> 44:58.666
I would have thought this
to be clear by now.

45:08.333 --> 45:13.083
We must forgive our archbishop.

45:13.166 --> 45:14.375
He is a far...

45:15.666 --> 45:18.458
far from gifted orator.

45:18.791 --> 45:21.666
Which is strange,
given I would have thought gifted oratory

45:21.750 --> 45:23.583
to be a requirement of the position.

45:25.458 --> 45:28.291
Why is the archbishop speaking to me
of war with France?

45:29.416 --> 45:33.291
What we are witnessing is a stirring,

45:33.375 --> 45:35.875
of which we must be wary.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.208
I applaud...

45:39.125 --> 45:40.458
your restraint.

45:41.625 --> 45:46.125
After so many years of strife,

45:47.791 --> 45:52.125
you are proving to be more
than your father's son.

45:53.250 --> 45:55.375
You wish to be a king for the people.

45:56.666 --> 45:58.875
Now, we must ensure to that end, however,

45:58.958 --> 46:02.250
you do not remain oblivious to the mood

46:02.833 --> 46:04.000
of the people.

46:05.083 --> 46:06.458
And what mood is this?

46:09.166 --> 46:11.333
That France is taunting us.

46:12.666 --> 46:14.208
Do you share this mood?

46:14.291 --> 46:15.708
Well...

46:16.333 --> 46:18.375
this mood is a fantasy.

46:19.875 --> 46:22.541
But that does not mean
it is not felt true.

46:26.250 --> 46:28.958
- Where are you going?
- Disgusting.

46:29.250 --> 46:31.750
-No, we can't be going to Hooper's.
-Yes, we can.

46:31.833 --> 46:33.750
-No, she won't have you.
-Yes, she will.

46:33.833 --> 46:34.666
- Nope!
-Yes.

46:34.750 --> 46:35.625
- No.
-Yes!

46:35.708 --> 46:37.666
-You're not welcome here.

46:37.750 --> 46:39.458
Unless you've come to pay me
what you owe me.

46:39.541 --> 46:40.750
I have paid you.

46:40.833 --> 46:43.208
You've paid me a snatch of what you owe.

46:43.791 --> 46:46.250
And I presume, too,
from the proceeds of thieving.

46:46.333 --> 46:47.166
Lies.

46:47.250 --> 46:50.000
By all account, you be not specially good
at thieving neither.

46:50.083 --> 46:50.916
Lies.

46:51.208 --> 46:53.750
How dare you address me so?

46:55.208 --> 46:56.750
Why would you be so churlish

46:56.833 --> 47:01.333
with the very man most likely to lift you
from your stinking rat hole?

47:01.958 --> 47:03.166
Oh, maybe you've forgot.

47:03.791 --> 47:07.083
My associations now stretch
to the highest reaches of the realm.

47:07.666 --> 47:10.666
Your insolence might as well be directed
to the king himself.

47:11.375 --> 47:12.541
Ponder that now.

47:13.000 --> 47:14.708
Are you speaking of Hal?

47:14.791 --> 47:15.625
Ah.

47:15.708 --> 47:16.583
Where is he?

47:17.250 --> 47:18.708
-Where is Hal?

47:18.791 --> 47:19.625
Oh.

47:19.708 --> 47:20.666
Where's our king?

47:21.666 --> 47:23.833
He be gone weeks and weeks now.
Where is he?

47:24.625 --> 47:26.375
-I would say...

47:27.250 --> 47:29.083
-you be the one that's been forgot.

47:29.166 --> 47:32.500
-Oh.
-I would say that your dalliance

47:32.583 --> 47:34.750
with the upper reaches of the realm

47:34.833 --> 47:36.458
was short-lived

47:36.541 --> 47:40.041
in and around his stinking sick bucket.

47:42.166 --> 47:45.958
Seems you were little more
than passing keeper of a prince's puke.

47:46.041 --> 47:47.625
-Shut up.

47:49.375 --> 47:50.875
Ponder that now.

47:50.958 --> 47:52.833
Nell, Sir John is down on his luck.

47:52.916 --> 47:53.875
I am not.

47:54.958 --> 47:57.291
You find someone to pay your way here.

47:58.125 --> 47:59.750
I'll not be paying it for you.

48:22.083 --> 48:23.000
Head.

48:23.916 --> 48:24.750
Head.

48:46.541 --> 48:47.500
Who are you?

48:48.875 --> 48:51.958
He seeks asylum in return for his tale.

48:53.500 --> 48:55.416
I do not doubt this can be arranged.

48:56.375 --> 48:59.083
Can it or not?
You are the King, no?

49:04.166 --> 49:05.750
It can be arranged.

49:08.166 --> 49:11.125
I have been sent by the King of France
to assassinate you.

49:15.625 --> 49:17.625
Charles himself sent you?

49:18.458 --> 49:19.916
You know this to be certain?

49:20.875 --> 49:22.875
The order's origin I know, yes.

49:22.958 --> 49:24.291
From the King.

49:26.416 --> 49:27.500
What was the order?

49:28.375 --> 49:30.500
That I should kill the King of England.

49:31.500 --> 49:32.666
How?

49:32.750 --> 49:35.208
However. Any way.

49:35.291 --> 49:37.250
There are many ways to kill a man.

49:37.916 --> 49:38.958
It is my talent...

49:39.833 --> 49:42.291
killing men
who do not expect to be killed.

49:46.708 --> 49:50.791
At such a time as I endeavor
to foster a fresh and peaceful air

49:50.875 --> 49:52.041
for this kingdom to breathe,

49:52.125 --> 49:55.083
it is not in my interest to stir hostility
with another.

49:55.166 --> 49:56.708
This is an act of war.

49:56.791 --> 50:00.541
We share your longing for peace,
my liege,

50:00.625 --> 50:04.333
but to ignore
such an audacious act of aggression

50:04.416 --> 50:06.625
will be seen as weakness.

50:07.541 --> 50:10.416
This is no game ball. This is an assassin.

50:10.500 --> 50:13.541
Would you consider me weak, Chief Justice?

50:13.625 --> 50:14.500
No.

50:15.541 --> 50:17.333
No, I speak more of the kingdom.

50:18.000 --> 50:19.208
What the kingdom sees.

50:19.291 --> 50:21.041
What the kingdom sees. Mm.

50:21.125 --> 50:24.916
How, pray, might the kingdom
see the weasel beneath our feet?

50:25.625 --> 50:27.041
If France's animus towards you

50:27.125 --> 50:29.791
runs deep enough for them
to send an assassin,

50:31.166 --> 50:34.333
it will be felt in the street,
ours and theirs.

50:34.416 --> 50:35.666
It will be known.

50:38.250 --> 50:39.750
We share your concerns.

50:40.125 --> 50:43.500
But peace today needs more than harmony.

50:43.583 --> 50:44.791
It needs strength...

50:46.041 --> 50:47.250
and confidence.

50:48.583 --> 50:51.750
These are qualities
that can originate only in you,

50:53.333 --> 50:54.250
the king.

50:57.000 --> 50:57.958
Our king.

51:06.041 --> 51:07.250
Take down these words...

51:10.500 --> 51:12.333
addressed to King Charles of France.

51:16.916 --> 51:18.250
This assassin you send

51:18.333 --> 51:21.291
can be taken as nothing other
than an infant act of war.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.416
If this be your intention,

51:25.541 --> 51:27.375
I say you let it be known plainly

51:28.041 --> 51:30.458
and that you desist
from this timorous slither

51:30.541 --> 51:32.208
in which you presently engage.

51:35.041 --> 51:36.458
If it be war you seek,

51:38.000 --> 51:39.750
send the full weight of your army.

51:40.916 --> 51:43.416
For a lone, cowardly assassin

51:43.500 --> 51:45.958
will not topple
this King Henry the Fifth of England

51:46.041 --> 51:47.500
you so underestimate.

52:08.291 --> 52:10.916
Fill this with gunstones
and send it back to France.

52:34.208 --> 52:35.416
Go get the master.

52:41.000 --> 52:43.166
- Who is it?
-A Frenchman, sire.

52:43.541 --> 52:45.791
He says he wishes
to speak with you privately.

52:46.625 --> 52:47.500
About what?

52:48.000 --> 52:49.500
He wouldn't say, sire.

52:49.875 --> 52:51.500
I asked of him, he wouldn't say.

52:59.125 --> 53:02.500
My king has sent me to seek out men
he feels he can trust.

53:03.166 --> 53:05.791
He believes there is
discreet discussion to be had.

53:07.000 --> 53:07.958
What discussion?

53:09.208 --> 53:13.000
He believes there is discussion to be had
about your new king of England.

53:54.416 --> 53:56.750
Only myself and Lord Grey
were met.

53:58.333 --> 54:02.208
We knew not where to turn
about what was spoken to us.

54:04.125 --> 54:06.666
We're all of us aware
there's a standing problem.

54:07.833 --> 54:09.791
Our king is of low repute.

54:10.833 --> 54:11.833
The French king...

54:12.583 --> 54:13.916
teaches you this?

54:15.125 --> 54:16.708
Is he not thankful

54:17.166 --> 54:21.125
for our young Henry's light reaction
to his provocation?

54:21.208 --> 54:24.125
The assassin he swears he knows not of.

54:24.208 --> 54:25.416
'Tis a charge he denies.

54:25.500 --> 54:26.750
His plot came to naught.

54:26.833 --> 54:29.208
Of course he would wish
to wipe his hands of it.

54:30.791 --> 54:32.291
Whatever the root,

54:32.875 --> 54:35.791
they have expressed grave concern

54:36.291 --> 54:38.416
regarding our king's mental fortitude.

54:39.250 --> 54:42.875
This envoy is to be trusted, is he not,
Cambridge?

54:43.625 --> 54:44.583
I believe so.

54:47.916 --> 54:50.708
Charles wishes to dethrone our king.

54:51.666 --> 54:53.750
The issue is not France.

54:55.166 --> 54:58.208
This is but a reminder to us
of a more general lunacy.

54:58.958 --> 55:01.541
A boy who but weeks ago
was a drunken boor

55:01.625 --> 55:04.375
from the sewers of Eastcheap
now wears England's crown.

55:04.875 --> 55:06.791
-Hmm.
- What shall become of us?

55:07.708 --> 55:09.833
What shall become of us
when civil misdeeds are forgiven

55:09.916 --> 55:11.833
as if they were but indiscretions?

55:12.833 --> 55:15.083
-When traitors--
-Yes, yes, Lord Grey, your--

55:16.166 --> 55:18.083
Your concerns are current.

55:19.958 --> 55:21.625
And they are numerous.

55:23.166 --> 55:24.833
Something must be done.

55:26.291 --> 55:27.625
Something will be done.

55:31.250 --> 55:32.291
Give me quiet.

55:46.416 --> 55:48.541
<i>Thus is a king's burden.</i>

55:51.083 --> 55:53.791
A king must make decisions

55:54.416 --> 55:55.708
lesser men are...

55:57.208 --> 56:00.000
neither willing nor able to make.

56:02.208 --> 56:04.625
A king is indeed presented with quandaries

56:04.708 --> 56:06.916
lesser men might never encounter

56:07.000 --> 56:08.833
in the course of their whole lives.

56:27.250 --> 56:29.000
I wish it were not so.

56:30.375 --> 56:31.791
But problems...

56:32.583 --> 56:34.416
And this is my experience.

56:34.500 --> 56:37.458
Problems that are left unattended...

56:39.000 --> 56:41.541
have a habit of becoming crises.

56:43.750 --> 56:46.916
You have a chance here
to unite the land, Hal.

56:47.666 --> 56:48.583
Truly.

56:50.500 --> 56:53.625
You have refreshed its mood with promise.

56:54.916 --> 56:57.166
But promise must be fulfilled.

57:00.208 --> 57:02.750
Promise can never be an end in itself.

57:29.875 --> 57:32.166
As of this day, we're at war with France.

57:34.666 --> 57:37.000
Twice I have given her
the benefit of my doubt.

57:38.208 --> 57:40.708
This third affront
will not be left unchecked.

57:43.416 --> 57:46.958
And so, in order to flush
these French rats from their nests,

57:48.541 --> 57:50.500
I will have it communicated to them

57:51.083 --> 57:52.583
that we are now at war.

58:04.625 --> 58:05.750
My Lord Grey.

58:06.791 --> 58:07.750
Cambridge.

58:14.083 --> 58:17.416
I would ask you to deliver this message
to France, given your...

58:19.083 --> 58:21.333
familiarity with its recipient.

58:24.125 --> 58:27.125
But I believe in the morning
you be otherwise engaged.

58:29.875 --> 58:31.166
Pray how, my liege?

58:33.791 --> 58:35.666
Tomorrow you will have your heads cut off.

58:35.750 --> 58:36.583
No.

58:37.916 --> 58:40.916
I have chosen to send you
as an advance party to Hell

58:41.375 --> 58:42.958
for the considerable French number

58:43.041 --> 58:45.250
that will soon be needing
to find space there.

58:50.333 --> 58:51.750
You were once my friend.

58:54.291 --> 58:55.916
I am your friend...

58:57.500 --> 58:58.333
cousin.

1:00:09.500 --> 1:00:10.500
All leave.

1:00:11.666 --> 1:00:12.500
Now.

1:00:19.750 --> 1:00:20.583
You.

1:00:21.333 --> 1:00:22.166
Stay.

1:00:25.416 --> 1:00:26.250
You...

1:00:27.166 --> 1:00:28.000
leave.

1:00:28.083 --> 1:00:29.666
This is my place.

1:00:30.333 --> 1:00:32.041
The hostess can stay.

1:00:40.916 --> 1:00:43.250
I will not jump to your attention.

1:00:44.583 --> 1:00:47.750
And surely not to retread
vile ground

1:00:47.833 --> 1:00:50.000
I vowed never to walk again.

1:00:51.708 --> 1:00:53.875
I acknowledge my neglect of you, John.

1:00:56.458 --> 1:01:00.291
A new chapter of my life has begun
before the last could be properly closed.

1:01:03.583 --> 1:01:05.875
These concerns are mine and mine alone.

1:01:07.708 --> 1:01:09.666
But the fact that this here
be the first occasion

1:01:09.750 --> 1:01:12.250
I've had to sound them aloud
to anyone other than myself

1:01:12.333 --> 1:01:13.625
speaks volumes.

1:01:17.125 --> 1:01:20.458
It speaks to the loneliness
of the position in which I find myself.

1:01:22.958 --> 1:01:24.083
To steer our present course,

1:01:24.166 --> 1:01:26.250
I've been forced
to rely upon the counsel of men

1:01:26.333 --> 1:01:29.125
whose loyalty I question
every waking moment.

1:01:31.958 --> 1:01:33.416
Every waking moment.

1:01:35.791 --> 1:01:38.000
I need men around me I can trust.

1:01:44.666 --> 1:01:46.416
I'm here because you are my friend.

1:01:50.291 --> 1:01:51.916
A king has no friends.

1:01:54.666 --> 1:01:56.166
A king has only...

1:01:57.125 --> 1:01:58.083
followers...

1:01:58.791 --> 1:01:59.708
and foe.

1:02:12.458 --> 1:02:14.458
I'm sorry my occasion to visit...

1:02:15.750 --> 1:02:17.958
carries with it this doleful weight.

1:02:23.583 --> 1:02:24.416
Hal.

1:02:27.750 --> 1:02:29.208
I will come with you.

1:02:30.166 --> 1:02:32.875
I ask only one favor in return.

1:02:35.333 --> 1:02:38.333
Square my account
with that terrible hag...

1:02:38.791 --> 1:02:40.333
over there. Would you?

1:02:46.541 --> 1:02:48.625
<i>We welcome</i>
<i>those newly arrived here.</i>

1:02:49.875 --> 1:02:53.416
Turn us now in common poise,
with one mind, sharpened.

1:02:55.208 --> 1:02:56.083
Together...

1:02:57.041 --> 1:02:58.541
we will bring France down.

1:02:59.625 --> 1:03:00.500
Together...

1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:02.833
we will bring her to her knees.

1:03:04.416 --> 1:03:06.208
Captains all, to this end,

1:03:06.958 --> 1:03:09.791
I wish to introduce to you
a new marshal of our campaign.

1:03:11.833 --> 1:03:13.166
Sir John Falstaff.

1:03:18.750 --> 1:03:21.916
Sir John's experience in battle
should need no recitation.

1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:22.875
You know of him.

1:03:23.750 --> 1:03:26.416
Some of you have had the honor
of fighting alongside him.

1:03:27.583 --> 1:03:29.916
Others have heard tale of his exploits.

1:03:31.083 --> 1:03:33.125
But I have tasked Sir John
to join this campaign

1:03:33.208 --> 1:03:35.083
for one most vital reason alone:

1:03:35.166 --> 1:03:36.375
he respects war

1:03:36.458 --> 1:03:39.500
as only a man who has seen
its most monstrous form can.

1:03:41.208 --> 1:03:42.708
He lusts after it not,

1:03:43.500 --> 1:03:45.333
but rather regards it
with the grim sobriety

1:03:45.416 --> 1:03:47.541
that you and your men
should hope he would.

1:03:52.083 --> 1:03:53.041
Welcome,

1:03:53.583 --> 1:03:54.750
and thank you...

1:03:54.833 --> 1:03:56.583
good sirs.

1:03:57.166 --> 1:03:58.416
You're all well met.

1:04:07.041 --> 1:04:08.250
Very good.

1:04:17.500 --> 1:04:18.625
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

1:04:28.541 --> 1:04:30.208
Are you ready for what awaits us?

1:04:31.625 --> 1:04:34.208
One is never ready for what awaits us.

1:04:50.416 --> 1:04:51.291
Get!

1:05:02.166 --> 1:05:05.416
You believe Sir John there
to be fit and suitable enough

1:05:05.500 --> 1:05:06.833
to captain this effort?

1:05:13.916 --> 1:05:15.291
John is a good man.

1:05:34.083 --> 1:05:36.416
They meet us at sea
or upon landing.

1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:40.458
We shall know soon enough.

1:05:44.916 --> 1:05:46.000
You must rest.

1:05:54.083 --> 1:05:54.916
John.

1:06:08.250 --> 1:06:09.083
Thank you.

1:06:11.333 --> 1:06:12.208
What for?

1:06:13.041 --> 1:06:13.958
For being here.

1:06:15.541 --> 1:06:16.541
With me.

1:06:17.250 --> 1:06:18.750
Well, it's a small price to pay

1:06:18.833 --> 1:06:21.291
to keep that detestable Hooper woman
off me back.

1:06:25.166 --> 1:06:26.708
Get some rest too, my liege.

1:07:03.625 --> 1:07:05.500
We land quickly!

1:07:33.750 --> 1:07:35.208
Check every building.

1:07:39.541 --> 1:07:40.666
No man!

1:07:40.750 --> 1:07:41.625
Watch.

1:07:41.708 --> 1:07:43.250
- No man here!
- Clear!

1:07:43.541 --> 1:07:45.333
- No man here.
- No man.

1:08:04.791 --> 1:08:05.791
Go on. Faster.

1:08:19.416 --> 1:08:20.250
Light.

1:08:21.166 --> 1:08:22.000
Pull!

1:08:37.291 --> 1:08:38.125
Pull!

1:09:26.375 --> 1:09:28.125
We must storm that castle.

1:09:29.625 --> 1:09:32.666
It will be bloody.
We will most surely sacrifice souls.

1:09:33.291 --> 1:09:35.875
Thus is the nature of war.
It is bloody and soulless.

1:09:36.708 --> 1:09:38.125
-We have no way of knowing

1:09:38.208 --> 1:09:40.250
how well supplied they are
behind those walls.

1:09:40.333 --> 1:09:41.791
This siege may take months,

1:09:41.875 --> 1:09:44.250
and months, I fear,
we have not at our disposal.

1:09:45.083 --> 1:09:46.916
Men in these numbers, fixed here,

1:09:47.541 --> 1:09:49.208
will fall to hunger and disease.

1:09:54.375 --> 1:09:55.250
Sir John.

1:10:00.666 --> 1:10:01.583
War is...

1:10:02.500 --> 1:10:04.000
bloody and soulless.

1:10:04.958 --> 1:10:05.791
Yes.

1:10:27.125 --> 1:10:28.708
The archbishop has arrived.

1:10:30.041 --> 1:10:32.208
Surely you cannot
simply idle here

1:10:32.291 --> 1:10:34.208
until they decide to come out?

1:10:35.416 --> 1:10:38.666
That is precisely the definition
of a siege.

1:10:39.750 --> 1:10:42.708
How long might that take?
Surely there's no way of knowing.

1:10:42.791 --> 1:10:46.208
Uh, that too,
is a common characteristic of a siege.

1:10:46.291 --> 1:10:48.791
-I will not send my men up that hill.
-But why in heavens not?

1:10:48.875 --> 1:10:53.041
I will not sacrifice my men so flagrantly,
nor so speculatively.

1:10:55.583 --> 1:10:57.708
Well, then why do you not
simply go around?

1:10:58.125 --> 1:11:02.250
If they insist on hiding in their castle,
why do you not simply go around it?

1:11:03.833 --> 1:11:06.375
So well versed in the art of warfare.

1:11:13.833 --> 1:11:16.083
We must take this town,
Archbishop.

1:11:16.791 --> 1:11:19.666
We must establish
a garrison foothold here...

1:11:20.708 --> 1:11:23.250
for our lines of supply from England.

1:11:25.333 --> 1:11:28.416
Do not forget
that I have underwritten this campaign.

1:11:30.083 --> 1:11:31.333
I have interest here.

1:11:32.666 --> 1:11:33.916
And I will be heard.

1:11:35.916 --> 1:11:38.416
Not today, Archbishop.

1:11:50.916 --> 1:11:51.916
My liege.

1:11:53.500 --> 1:11:54.625
They have surrendered.

1:11:57.458 --> 1:12:00.291
-Our debate now, it seems, is for nothing.
-Hmm.

1:12:03.375 --> 1:12:05.250
As are the archbishop's bleatings.

1:12:10.375 --> 1:12:11.875
The day is yours.

1:12:13.625 --> 1:12:16.166
We ask only
that our women and children be freed.

1:12:17.166 --> 1:12:19.458
Many are hungry and wounded
and becoming sick.

1:12:24.500 --> 1:12:27.958
Upon full account of the castle,

1:12:28.041 --> 1:12:30.583
I see no reason to deny your request.

1:12:30.958 --> 1:12:34.458
You will have tonight
to oversee this evacuation

1:12:35.583 --> 1:12:38.291
and to corral your men prisoners.

1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:54.875
Come.

1:13:09.500 --> 1:13:11.291
He wishes to slow us.

1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:14.625
Who wishes to slow us?

1:13:17.750 --> 1:13:21.125
We have received word
that the Dauphin is en route.

1:13:21.750 --> 1:13:23.875
He wishes conference with His Majesty.

1:13:24.958 --> 1:13:26.625
And we know nothing of his purpose?

1:13:26.708 --> 1:13:29.041
We know only that he desires conference.

1:13:29.125 --> 1:13:33.583
I would hope his purpose be
to deliver his father's early surrender.

1:13:33.666 --> 1:13:36.416
I strongly advise
we disregard this word of his approach

1:13:36.500 --> 1:13:37.458
and ready our movement.

1:13:38.125 --> 1:13:40.208
We must make advantage of their disarray.

1:13:43.416 --> 1:13:45.166
Sir John, your counsel.

1:13:46.750 --> 1:13:48.041
I've never met the man...

1:13:48.916 --> 1:13:50.208
this French prince.

1:13:51.583 --> 1:13:53.333
I can't speak to his motivation.

1:14:16.083 --> 1:14:17.083
My liege.

1:14:20.916 --> 1:14:21.791
He's here.

1:14:47.375 --> 1:14:48.333
Your Majesty.

1:14:51.375 --> 1:14:53.041
Ah!

1:14:56.416 --> 1:14:57.416
To...

1:14:57.500 --> 1:14:58.416
your little...

1:14:59.416 --> 1:15:00.291
victory.

1:15:04.333 --> 1:15:05.166
Ah.

1:15:09.375 --> 1:15:10.916
Do you wonder why

1:15:11.541 --> 1:15:12.416
I have come?

1:15:14.375 --> 1:15:15.208
Hmm?

1:15:16.500 --> 1:15:17.458
Do you wonder this?

1:15:21.208 --> 1:15:25.375
I have not come to offer you surrender

1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:28.375
if that is what you are hoping.

1:15:31.541 --> 1:15:35.208
I have come to describe for you

1:15:35.875 --> 1:15:37.625
your end days,

1:15:39.375 --> 1:15:41.041
the screams of your men

1:15:41.666 --> 1:15:43.166
as they die slow.

1:15:44.375 --> 1:15:47.000
And so, King of, uh, England,

1:15:48.458 --> 1:15:51.625
you seem so intent
on making France your new home,

1:15:52.541 --> 1:15:53.666
so let me help you.

1:15:55.166 --> 1:15:58.458
I will drain your body of its blood

1:15:59.375 --> 1:16:02.333
and bury it under a tree.

1:16:03.375 --> 1:16:05.750
A little French tree.

1:16:07.041 --> 1:16:08.000
Very young,

1:16:08.791 --> 1:16:09.833
very small.

1:16:11.916 --> 1:16:15.416
Since perchance that is fitting
of your mind for you to come here.

1:16:17.041 --> 1:16:17.916
Small.

1:16:20.833 --> 1:16:21.916
And maybe your...

1:16:26.625 --> 1:16:28.583
I mean, no, your balls must be big, no?

1:16:30.458 --> 1:16:31.458
Giant balls.

1:16:34.583 --> 1:16:35.708
Giant balls...

1:16:36.625 --> 1:16:37.791
with a tiny cock.

1:16:46.958 --> 1:16:51.333
And the sound
of your wives and children weeping

1:16:52.541 --> 1:16:54.666
shall lull me to sleep at night.

1:17:12.083 --> 1:17:13.625
Have you heard what I said?

1:17:15.125 --> 1:17:16.041
I have.

1:17:17.541 --> 1:17:18.666
It was stirring.

1:17:21.958 --> 1:17:23.666
Sir John, please walk with me.

1:17:27.583 --> 1:17:28.416
Good night.

1:17:40.958 --> 1:17:42.375
Ready the men to move.

1:17:44.625 --> 1:17:45.750
Waste no time.

1:20:03.083 --> 1:20:03.916
Run!

1:20:15.125 --> 1:20:16.750
Hush, hush, hush.

1:20:17.083 --> 1:20:17.916
Hush.

1:20:18.708 --> 1:20:19.541
Hush.

1:20:22.833 --> 1:20:24.000
Hello, little boy.

1:20:25.916 --> 1:20:27.958
Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid.

1:20:31.666 --> 1:20:36.125
I want you to deliver a gift to your king.

1:20:37.500 --> 1:20:38.875
Will you do this for me?

1:20:40.833 --> 1:20:41.791
Good boy.

1:21:04.375 --> 1:21:05.291
No!

1:21:14.166 --> 1:21:16.541
Double the guards to 20 yards
through the night.

1:21:16.875 --> 1:21:18.250
Three hours at a watch.

1:21:19.083 --> 1:21:20.375
I want these men fresh and alert.

1:21:20.458 --> 1:21:22.916
Any man caught sleeping
will have his eyes gouged.

1:21:24.291 --> 1:21:26.250
Any caught speaking will lose his tongue.

1:21:33.125 --> 1:21:36.000
And I want all French prisoners
in our train put to death.

1:21:37.416 --> 1:21:40.250
Leave their corpses speared on pikes
by the river's edge.

1:21:41.666 --> 1:21:43.958
The first command I'll heed.

1:21:44.958 --> 1:21:46.000
The second...

1:21:47.500 --> 1:21:50.708
you'll have to carry out
that mass execution yourself.

1:21:52.541 --> 1:21:53.666
What did you say to me?

1:21:54.833 --> 1:21:56.291
You are not that man.

1:21:57.166 --> 1:21:58.666
How dare you defy me?

1:21:58.750 --> 1:22:00.625
Show your feeling in here, with me.

1:22:00.708 --> 1:22:03.416
-Don't let it outside this tent.
-How dare you defy me? I am the king.

1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:07.083
And where is
the fearsome old warrior Falstaff

1:22:07.166 --> 1:22:08.625
about whom I've heard so much?

1:22:09.666 --> 1:22:11.791
You've been mute since we crossed the sea.

1:22:12.541 --> 1:22:14.333
I seem to be serving
as my own chief tactician,

1:22:14.416 --> 1:22:16.166
my own commander, my own counsel.

1:22:17.291 --> 1:22:19.541
Where is
the fearsome old warrior Falstaff?!

1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:24.625
I speak only
when there's something to be said.

1:22:26.958 --> 1:22:29.250
Too often have I seen men of war

1:22:29.875 --> 1:22:31.666
invent work for themselves,

1:22:32.625 --> 1:22:35.708
work that leads to nothing
but vainglory and slaughtered men.

1:22:36.666 --> 1:22:37.708
I'm not that man.

1:22:39.125 --> 1:22:41.625
And this here is the war
that you have chosen to wage.

1:22:41.708 --> 1:22:44.291
I will disembowel you right here
with mine own hand.

1:22:49.625 --> 1:22:51.416
You are not that man, either.

1:23:08.041 --> 1:23:09.250
Evening, M'Lord.

1:23:09.666 --> 1:23:11.583
- Gentlemen.
- M'Lord.

1:24:47.875 --> 1:24:48.750
Lord Dorset,

1:24:49.250 --> 1:24:50.625
summon your fastest rider.

1:24:51.250 --> 1:24:52.083
My liege.

1:24:53.208 --> 1:24:54.166
Dartmouth!

1:24:59.375 --> 1:25:00.875
Sires. What can I do for you?

1:25:00.958 --> 1:25:04.041
Tell me what lies over that hill.
Ride fast, return directly.

1:25:04.416 --> 1:25:05.291
Hyah!

1:25:30.125 --> 1:25:32.625
We are both outnumbered
and out-positioned.

1:25:33.416 --> 1:25:35.375
They have the downslope in their favor.

1:25:36.375 --> 1:25:38.708
Our need to advance
puts us already at disadvantage.

1:25:38.791 --> 1:25:40.791
The longer we wait,
the larger their force will grow,

1:25:40.875 --> 1:25:42.375
and with it, our disadvantage.

1:25:43.166 --> 1:25:45.708
Your archers, my lord,
are of superior faculty.

1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:48.541
French crossbow is no match
for an English longbow.

1:25:49.208 --> 1:25:52.625
We should hobble their number
on first assault by these means alone.

1:25:55.250 --> 1:25:58.291
York's charge in center
faces four lines of mounted knights.

1:25:58.375 --> 1:26:00.708
Our archers here
might weaken those by half. But--

1:26:02.208 --> 1:26:03.541
But not eight lines.

1:26:04.708 --> 1:26:06.125
Nine. Ten. More.

1:26:06.416 --> 1:26:07.708
You speak true, my liege.

1:26:07.791 --> 1:26:10.041
The longer we wait,
the greater our disadvantage.

1:26:10.125 --> 1:26:14.000
But it is possible our disadvantage
has already grown insurmountable.

1:26:15.583 --> 1:26:18.083
A great many men
are already desperately ill

1:26:18.166 --> 1:26:19.625
and weak from hunger.

1:26:19.708 --> 1:26:20.750
What then, my lord,

1:26:21.541 --> 1:26:22.958
do you propose we do?

1:26:23.875 --> 1:26:26.166
I propose we consider turning back,
my liege.

1:26:27.458 --> 1:26:29.791
I know it will not bring
the outcome we desire,

1:26:29.875 --> 1:26:32.041
but nor will the evisceration of our army.

1:26:35.458 --> 1:26:37.791
I'm reticent to speak for others here now,

1:26:39.125 --> 1:26:41.166
but I'm certain my fears are shared.

1:26:49.750 --> 1:26:51.791
Who here agrees with Lord Dorset?

1:26:57.291 --> 1:26:58.916
You can win this battle.

1:27:01.541 --> 1:27:03.041
Is that so, Sir John?

1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:04.875
Yes.

1:27:05.541 --> 1:27:08.041
And precisely how is that so, Sir John?

1:27:08.875 --> 1:27:11.333
You fight without horses
and without armor.

1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:14.416
Heavens above,
please spare us from this man.

1:27:15.166 --> 1:27:18.333
Their forward defense
is a front line of mounted men.

1:27:19.625 --> 1:27:20.541
Many deep.

1:27:20.958 --> 1:27:21.916
Knights all.

1:27:22.500 --> 1:27:23.791
All on horseback,

1:27:24.250 --> 1:27:25.541
all with heavy armor.

1:27:27.750 --> 1:27:29.208
The ground out there...

1:27:30.291 --> 1:27:31.458
is a flood bowl,

1:27:32.541 --> 1:27:33.833
already half-sodden.

1:27:34.333 --> 1:27:36.791
When it rains tonight, as I know it will,

1:27:38.166 --> 1:27:40.375
that ground will turn into a muddy bog.

1:27:41.083 --> 1:27:43.000
And with their horses and their armor,

1:27:44.125 --> 1:27:45.375
they will get stuck,

1:27:46.250 --> 1:27:47.250
they will fall,

1:27:48.416 --> 1:27:50.791
and they will flounder
like upturned beetles.

1:27:50.875 --> 1:27:51.958
As shall we.

1:27:52.583 --> 1:27:54.250
Not if we travel light,

1:27:54.750 --> 1:27:56.625
without horses and without armor.

1:27:57.875 --> 1:28:00.708
Speed and mobility will be our advantage.

1:28:02.041 --> 1:28:03.666
And how, Sir John,

1:28:04.166 --> 1:28:06.625
can you be so sure of rainfall tonight?

1:28:09.333 --> 1:28:10.958
My right knee is aching.

1:28:11.041 --> 1:28:13.166
It only does that when rain is near.

1:28:14.541 --> 1:28:16.875
Oh, save us, my liege.
Please put a stop to this drivel.

1:28:18.125 --> 1:28:21.541
This would require their armored
front line come meet us in the mud.

1:28:21.625 --> 1:28:23.333
How do you propose we invite that?

1:28:23.958 --> 1:28:26.708
A small forward armored attack of our own.

1:28:28.458 --> 1:28:29.666
A false advance.

1:28:31.416 --> 1:28:32.458
They will counter.

1:28:33.125 --> 1:28:37.625
We save our weight and our muscle
for a nimble assault from the flanks.

1:28:37.708 --> 1:28:42.000
They shan't be so easily deceived.
They will not respond to false attack.

1:28:42.083 --> 1:28:42.916
Hmm.

1:28:46.250 --> 1:28:47.500
They will respond.

1:28:48.916 --> 1:28:51.458
We move, they will meet us in the mud.

1:28:52.083 --> 1:28:54.791
Our men-at-arms are outnumbered.
This they know.

1:28:55.500 --> 1:28:57.125
They will hope to overwhelm us,

1:28:57.541 --> 1:28:59.416
so they will meet us with full force,

1:28:59.958 --> 1:29:02.333
no matter how small our first advance.

1:29:03.500 --> 1:29:07.208
Our great longbows
will rain chaos on them from above.

1:29:08.458 --> 1:29:10.333
That chaos will be your favor.

1:29:10.416 --> 1:29:14.500
My liege, I implore you, we mustn't...
we mustn't listen to this madness.

1:29:15.750 --> 1:29:17.875
What is the true experience of this man?

1:29:18.458 --> 1:29:20.583
He once fought for Richard many years ago.

1:29:20.666 --> 1:29:22.666
Since then, he has done nothing...

1:29:23.916 --> 1:29:25.666
other than ride with the companies,

1:29:26.708 --> 1:29:28.083
robbing and tormenting.

1:29:30.083 --> 1:29:33.208
I never robbed anyone
who didn't deserve to be robbed.

1:29:39.458 --> 1:29:41.208
If it rains tonight,

1:29:42.500 --> 1:29:44.000
we fight tomorrow.

1:30:06.583 --> 1:30:10.083
If you have concocted this plan,
half-baked and speculative,

1:30:11.250 --> 1:30:13.208
merely to prove to me your worth,

1:30:14.541 --> 1:30:15.750
please say so now.

1:30:19.750 --> 1:30:21.666
All plans are speculative.

1:30:23.750 --> 1:30:27.541
And as I say,
I only speak them when I feel them true.

1:30:28.333 --> 1:30:30.041
This one I feel in my bones.

1:30:32.416 --> 1:30:34.333
This one I feel in my knee bone.

1:30:40.416 --> 1:30:42.958
Here we are on the eve of this fight,
and I am...

1:30:46.208 --> 1:30:48.125
I am scared to wonder,

1:30:48.791 --> 1:30:49.916
to tell it true,

1:30:53.416 --> 1:30:54.625
why we are here.

1:30:56.541 --> 1:30:58.833
You best discover the answer for that.

1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:01.666
The men out there deserve it.

1:31:04.208 --> 1:31:05.958
They've given their lives to you.

1:31:08.458 --> 1:31:11.750
I cannot say what forces
have conspired to bring you here,

1:31:11.833 --> 1:31:13.375
but these men need you,

1:31:14.833 --> 1:31:16.208
just as you need them.

1:31:17.875 --> 1:31:20.125
These men deserve your confidence.

1:31:25.166 --> 1:31:27.083
And if you cannot give them that,

1:31:27.541 --> 1:31:30.583
at least then tell them a magnificent lie.

1:31:37.958 --> 1:31:40.041
Though you might not think it possible...

1:31:42.166 --> 1:31:43.416
you are my friend.

1:31:49.416 --> 1:31:50.375
Good night, Hal.

1:31:53.666 --> 1:31:54.583
Sleep well.

1:33:19.416 --> 1:33:21.416
This wind whips from the north.

1:33:23.291 --> 1:33:25.166
The rain was sent from England.

1:33:25.250 --> 1:33:28.625
Why are you being fitted with plate?
We were to fight without armor.

1:33:29.333 --> 1:33:31.375
We need a front line to draw them in.

1:33:34.041 --> 1:33:35.041
It cannot be you.

1:33:35.666 --> 1:33:36.916
The idea was mine.

1:33:37.875 --> 1:33:41.708
Some man must lead the first push
to sell it well.

1:33:43.125 --> 1:33:44.583
My men have been assembled.

1:33:45.791 --> 1:33:47.375
And I cannot, in good conscience,

1:33:47.458 --> 1:33:50.083
send them out there
to realize my speculative drivel

1:33:50.166 --> 1:33:52.125
without getting muddy alongside them,
can I?

1:33:52.958 --> 1:33:54.125
I will fight with you.

1:33:56.333 --> 1:33:58.166
It's noble,

1:33:58.250 --> 1:33:59.666
but you know that cannot be.

1:34:02.291 --> 1:34:03.875
This is what I was built for.

1:34:05.375 --> 1:34:06.916
I die here or...

1:34:07.750 --> 1:34:10.041
I die over a bottle in Eastcheap.

1:34:10.833 --> 1:34:13.458
And I think this makes
for a much better story.

1:34:15.333 --> 1:34:17.125
And you have things still to do.

1:34:19.958 --> 1:34:21.583
You will join this fight.

1:34:23.666 --> 1:34:26.958
But promise me you don't join too early.

1:34:27.791 --> 1:34:29.875
It doesn't matter what you see out there.

1:34:31.541 --> 1:34:33.833
We must first draw them all in.
All of them.

1:34:36.208 --> 1:34:37.458
Promise me that, Hal.

1:34:40.125 --> 1:34:41.875
Win, my friend.

1:34:43.666 --> 1:34:47.041
Maybe then you'll lighten enough
to have a drink with me. Hmm?

1:35:10.333 --> 1:35:11.875
Where is the Dauphin?

1:35:26.375 --> 1:35:29.125
I humbly thank you for receiving me,
noble lord.

1:35:29.458 --> 1:35:30.458
Please.

1:35:31.416 --> 1:35:32.500
Please speak English.

1:35:34.250 --> 1:35:37.041
I enjoy to speak English.

1:35:38.875 --> 1:35:40.291
It is simple...

1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:41.833
and ugly.

1:35:44.250 --> 1:35:45.666
I have been waiting all morning,

1:35:47.041 --> 1:35:48.000
all the night...

1:35:48.541 --> 1:35:49.500
for your surrender.

1:35:51.250 --> 1:35:54.333
It might have saved a great unease

1:35:54.708 --> 1:35:55.791
had it come sooner.

1:35:56.541 --> 1:35:58.416
I know you do not speak for your father.

1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:00.375
I do speak for my father.

1:36:00.458 --> 1:36:03.750
I know you do not speak for your father,
so I come to you now directly.

1:36:03.833 --> 1:36:05.291
I have not come to surrender.

1:36:06.416 --> 1:36:09.708
Too much Christian blood
will be spilled on this field today.

1:36:09.791 --> 1:36:11.125
So, I propose this:

1:36:12.375 --> 1:36:14.666
You and I fight, one man on one man.

1:36:16.291 --> 1:36:17.833
We fight in our armies' stead.

1:36:19.041 --> 1:36:22.166
If I lose, my men will leave this place
forthwith and forever.

1:36:22.541 --> 1:36:23.666
You will have my head.

1:36:25.250 --> 1:36:26.083
If I win,

1:36:26.166 --> 1:36:29.166
I will assume this kingdom's crown
upon your father's death.

1:36:35.041 --> 1:36:35.958
What say you?

1:36:38.583 --> 1:36:41.000
Are you scared, young Henry?

1:36:43.750 --> 1:36:44.916
What say you?

1:36:45.833 --> 1:36:47.333
Are you scared of this battle?

1:36:48.375 --> 1:36:49.958
There is no shame of it.

1:36:55.666 --> 1:36:56.708
Save your men.

1:36:57.500 --> 1:36:59.166
You save your own men.

1:37:01.125 --> 1:37:02.458
You came here.

1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:03.916
To me!

1:37:04.666 --> 1:37:06.166
Surrender to me!

1:37:08.916 --> 1:37:10.125
I cannot do that.

1:37:11.833 --> 1:37:13.000
Well, then, boy,

1:37:13.958 --> 1:37:15.375
let us make famous...

1:37:16.708 --> 1:37:17.958
that field out there.

1:37:19.208 --> 1:37:21.541
This little village of Agincourt,

1:37:22.791 --> 1:37:26.000
that will forever mark the site
of your callow disgrace.

1:37:57.625 --> 1:37:59.208
You expect of me a speech?

1:38:02.041 --> 1:38:03.500
I have only one to give,

1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:05.291
and it is the same one I'd give

1:38:05.375 --> 1:38:08.166
were we not standing
on the brim of a battlefield.

1:38:08.625 --> 1:38:12.500
It is the same one I'd give
were we to meet in the street by chance.

1:38:13.750 --> 1:38:16.083
I have only ever hoped for one thing...

1:38:17.833 --> 1:38:21.333
to see this kingdom united
under this English crown.

1:38:28.583 --> 1:38:30.583
All men are born to die. We know it.

1:38:31.250 --> 1:38:33.041
We carry it with us always.

1:38:34.083 --> 1:38:37.250
If your day be today, so be it.

1:38:37.333 --> 1:38:38.625
Mine will be tomorrow.

1:38:39.833 --> 1:38:42.625
Or mine today and yours tomorrow.
It matters not.

1:38:43.625 --> 1:38:45.750
What matters is that you know,
in your hearts,

1:38:45.833 --> 1:38:48.375
that today you are that kingdom united.

1:38:48.458 --> 1:38:49.750
You are England.

1:38:49.833 --> 1:38:52.791
Each and every one of you. England is you.

1:38:53.250 --> 1:38:55.458
And it is the space between you.

1:38:55.541 --> 1:38:58.500
Fight not for yourselves,
fight for that space.

1:38:58.583 --> 1:38:59.666
Fill that space.

1:38:59.750 --> 1:39:01.166
Make it tissue.

1:39:01.250 --> 1:39:02.125
Make it mass.

1:39:02.208 --> 1:39:03.833
Make it impenetrable.

1:39:03.916 --> 1:39:05.125
Make it yours!

1:39:05.208 --> 1:39:06.791
Make it England!

1:39:07.375 --> 1:39:09.083
Make it England!

1:39:16.833 --> 1:39:19.250
Great men to it. Captains, lords.

1:39:19.583 --> 1:39:21.041
Great men to it!

1:39:50.458 --> 1:39:53.416
For the King and St. George!

1:39:53.500 --> 1:39:56.916
For the King and St. George!

1:40:17.833 --> 1:40:19.291
<i>Les imb√©ciles.</i>

1:41:38.458 --> 1:41:39.416
Archers.

1:41:39.500 --> 1:41:40.625
Archers!

1:41:41.208 --> 1:41:42.416
Archers!

1:41:42.500 --> 1:41:44.583
Archers! Now!

1:41:46.291 --> 1:41:47.416
Draw!

1:41:51.208 --> 1:41:52.041
Loose!

1:42:12.083 --> 1:42:13.250
Halt!

1:42:15.041 --> 1:42:15.875
Ready!

1:44:38.583 --> 1:44:39.541
Loose!

1:45:00.375 --> 1:45:01.625
On me!

1:49:31.916 --> 1:49:32.750
Come then...

1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:39.041
King of England.

1:52:47.083 --> 1:52:48.166
Hail the King.

1:52:48.416 --> 1:52:49.375
Hail the King.

1:52:55.916 --> 1:52:56.958
Hail the King.

1:52:57.791 --> 1:52:58.750
My liege.

1:52:58.833 --> 1:53:00.666
-God save the King.
-Hail the King.

1:53:03.791 --> 1:53:04.750
Hail the King.

1:53:05.541 --> 1:53:06.541
Hail the King.

1:53:09.708 --> 1:53:11.750
-Hail the King.
-Hail King Henry.

1:53:11.833 --> 1:53:12.958
Hail the King.

1:53:14.833 --> 1:53:16.000
My liege.

1:53:16.625 --> 1:53:18.708
The prisoners we have took are a rabble.

1:53:19.875 --> 1:53:22.916
I fear we will not secure them
should their army regroup.

1:53:26.416 --> 1:53:27.416
Kill them all.

1:54:11.833 --> 1:54:13.208
Your Majesty...

1:54:14.041 --> 1:54:16.125
Henry, King of England.

1:54:17.875 --> 1:54:18.708
Hmm.

1:54:23.166 --> 1:54:25.041
Your Majesty...

1:54:25.958 --> 1:54:27.375
Come sit here with me.

1:54:31.875 --> 1:54:32.791
Please.

1:54:43.583 --> 1:54:47.750
I like to have the sun on my skin,
but not too much.

1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:50.958
Too much is very dangerous.

1:55:06.416 --> 1:55:10.208
This conversation we are about to have...

1:55:11.250 --> 1:55:13.375
has been had many times before,

1:55:13.458 --> 1:55:17.666
and will be had many times again
for centuries to come

1:55:18.291 --> 1:55:22.583
between men of vanity
and men of good reason.

1:55:23.625 --> 1:55:26.333
I would hope that you and I

1:55:26.416 --> 1:55:28.000
are men of good reason.

1:55:32.708 --> 1:55:35.541
I have, of course, traveled here

1:55:35.625 --> 1:55:38.250
to offer you my surrender.

1:55:41.416 --> 1:55:43.500
Do you ask anything of me in return?

1:55:45.708 --> 1:55:46.541
No.

1:55:53.250 --> 1:55:54.750
I do, however,

1:55:55.250 --> 1:55:57.458
have for you a proposition.

1:56:00.375 --> 1:56:03.625
You take the hand of my daughter,

1:56:03.708 --> 1:56:04.625
Catherine,

1:56:06.583 --> 1:56:07.666
in marriage.

1:56:11.083 --> 1:56:12.625
It is most uncanny...

1:56:14.375 --> 1:56:16.708
that the great movements of history

1:56:16.791 --> 1:56:21.333
so frequently find their origins
in the minutia of family.

1:56:24.375 --> 1:56:27.166
That in ways I dare not unsettle here,

1:56:28.666 --> 1:56:30.916
my relationship with my son

1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:32.083
and yours...

1:56:32.833 --> 1:56:33.916
with your father.

1:56:35.166 --> 1:56:38.625
These are the things
that have led us here today.

1:56:41.458 --> 1:56:43.250
We are leaders of lands

1:56:44.041 --> 1:56:45.000
and peoples,

1:56:46.291 --> 1:56:47.208
and yet...

1:56:48.250 --> 1:56:50.375
it is family that moves us.

1:56:52.666 --> 1:56:53.625
Family...

1:56:54.250 --> 1:56:55.541
consumes us.

1:57:37.958 --> 1:57:39.916
My condolences to you...

1:57:40.875 --> 1:57:43.500
for the loss of your friend, Sir John.

1:57:46.208 --> 1:57:49.041
I know you must feel this loss deeply.

1:57:55.000 --> 1:57:56.125
Thank you, William.

1:57:58.500 --> 1:58:00.208
Your loyalty to me has been comforting.

1:58:19.416 --> 1:58:22.666
You have proven yourself
to be a most worthy king.

1:58:26.208 --> 1:58:28.833
I would say you have proven yourself

1:58:28.916 --> 1:58:31.416
to be one of England's great kings.

1:58:45.041 --> 1:58:47.916
Your Majesty,
the crowd has gathered.

1:58:49.416 --> 1:58:50.458
So I hear.

1:59:16.833 --> 1:59:17.750
Leave us.

1:59:30.958 --> 1:59:32.916
Please sit, Your Majesty.

1:59:43.000 --> 1:59:44.541
You are beautiful.

1:59:44.625 --> 1:59:45.500
<i>Merci.</i>

1:59:47.666 --> 1:59:49.166
I will no longer speak French.

1:59:49.916 --> 1:59:51.041
We must speak English.

1:59:51.750 --> 1:59:53.041
I cannot speak English.

1:59:53.125 --> 1:59:54.083
You will learn.

1:59:55.625 --> 1:59:57.083
I wonder, then,

1:59:57.708 --> 2:00:00.333
how our union might proceed
in the meantime.

2:00:03.791 --> 2:00:06.875
There is much I wonder
about a great many things.

2:00:08.875 --> 2:00:10.541
Indeed there must be for you

2:00:10.625 --> 2:00:13.416
to contemplate marriage
to a woman about whom...

2:00:13.500 --> 2:00:15.833
you know so little.

2:00:16.125 --> 2:00:17.125
Hmm.

2:00:21.000 --> 2:00:22.833
I will not submit to you.

2:00:23.916 --> 2:00:25.750
You must earn my respect.

2:00:28.833 --> 2:00:30.083
I understand that.

2:00:31.750 --> 2:00:32.583
Do you?

2:00:33.208 --> 2:00:34.208
I do.

2:00:35.916 --> 2:00:38.208
Do you feel a sense of achievement?

2:00:41.375 --> 2:00:42.416
In what regard?

2:00:42.500 --> 2:00:43.625
In any regard.

2:00:43.875 --> 2:00:46.291
I have achieved that
which my father never could.

2:00:46.875 --> 2:00:49.041
I have united this kingdom
in common cause.

2:00:49.541 --> 2:00:50.375
Hmm.

2:00:52.541 --> 2:00:55.291
You have achieved momentary respite.

2:00:56.541 --> 2:00:58.416
A unity forged under false pretense

2:00:58.500 --> 2:01:00.708
will never be a unity that prevails.

2:01:01.041 --> 2:01:04.291
How, pray, have my endeavors
been forged falsely?

2:01:07.041 --> 2:01:09.166
Why did you bring war to France?

2:01:09.500 --> 2:01:11.208
Your father came on spoiling.

2:01:12.041 --> 2:01:14.166
How so? How was he spoiling?

2:01:15.416 --> 2:01:16.791
He sent an assassin.

2:01:17.375 --> 2:01:18.875
There was no assassin.

2:01:19.541 --> 2:01:21.041
There was no plot to kill you.

2:01:24.875 --> 2:01:25.875
How might you know?

2:01:26.958 --> 2:01:30.208
Because I was with my father
when he received word of your charge.

2:01:30.625 --> 2:01:33.500
I know him well enough
to know his reaction to be genuine.

2:01:36.208 --> 2:01:37.416
How was his reaction?

2:01:38.375 --> 2:01:39.541
He laughed.

2:01:40.833 --> 2:01:43.208
He laughed very much.
He said you must be drunk.

2:01:44.208 --> 2:01:45.750
Your father is a madman.

2:01:46.541 --> 2:01:48.541
He may be mad, but he is true.

2:01:49.250 --> 2:01:52.291
His madness makes him true.
He says only what he believes.

2:01:53.083 --> 2:01:54.666
That is why he is loved.

2:01:56.916 --> 2:01:58.875
The assassin then
was sent by your brother.

2:01:58.958 --> 2:01:59.833
-My brother?
-Mm-hmm.

2:01:59.916 --> 2:02:02.083
My brother was too stupid
to conjure such a plan.

2:02:04.125 --> 2:02:05.500
What was your true reason?

2:02:06.208 --> 2:02:07.875
Did you know of the ball he sent?

2:02:10.166 --> 2:02:11.750
The ball he sent to me?

2:02:15.625 --> 2:02:16.541
A ball?

2:02:19.833 --> 2:02:20.958
He sent to you...

2:02:21.958 --> 2:02:24.333
-a ball?
-Why should you question my intent?

2:02:25.291 --> 2:02:28.666
Your father's rule is illegitimate.
He has no right claim to his throne.

2:02:28.750 --> 2:02:30.750
All monarchy is illegitimate.<i> </i>

2:02:31.625 --> 2:02:33.791
You yourself are the son of a usurper.

2:02:43.000 --> 2:02:46.250
It would seem that you have no explanation
for what you have done.

2:02:48.041 --> 2:02:51.125
You have shed the blood
of so many Christian souls, and yet...

2:02:53.000 --> 2:02:54.875
before me now, all I see is a...

2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:58.458
young and vain and foolish man

2:02:58.541 --> 2:03:00.000
so easily riled.

2:03:03.333 --> 2:03:04.875
So easily beguiled.

2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:17.500
I must leave you now.

2:03:28.625 --> 2:03:29.666
Gentle.

2:03:39.500 --> 2:03:40.500
Ah.

2:03:44.583 --> 2:03:48.041
We must be sure to revel in this day,
my friend.

2:03:49.541 --> 2:03:53.208
A crowd has gathered
in honor of our victory.

2:03:55.083 --> 2:03:57.500
These are the rare moments
for which a king truly lives,

2:03:57.583 --> 2:03:58.916
I would imagine.

2:04:01.875 --> 2:04:03.833
In all my preoccupation, I have...

2:04:04.416 --> 2:04:06.541
neglected to ask after your family.

2:04:07.083 --> 2:04:07.916
Oh.

2:04:08.583 --> 2:04:11.416
Your preoccupations are hardly trifling.

2:04:12.375 --> 2:04:13.541
You have two sons.

2:04:14.166 --> 2:04:15.000
I do.

2:04:16.500 --> 2:04:17.583
And...

2:04:18.458 --> 2:04:20.916
your wife minds your estate
in your absence.

2:04:21.666 --> 2:04:22.666
She does.

2:04:26.666 --> 2:04:27.708
Yours is sheep.

2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:31.083
You're a man of wool.

2:04:32.000 --> 2:04:33.666
As was my father before me.

2:04:35.166 --> 2:04:36.375
How many head?

2:04:37.375 --> 2:04:41.666
At last count, some 4,000.
Mostly Dorset Horns.

2:04:45.541 --> 2:04:46.833
How much land have you?

2:04:47.916 --> 2:04:48.750
Oh.

2:04:49.958 --> 2:04:51.791
To be true, I'm not...

2:04:52.875 --> 2:04:54.333
wholly certain, but...

2:04:55.125 --> 2:04:56.083
but many...

2:04:56.166 --> 2:04:58.750
many hundreds
of beautiful, beautiful acres.

2:05:07.458 --> 2:05:09.958
What lands in France have you now annexed?

2:05:12.583 --> 2:05:13.458
Stop.

2:05:16.333 --> 2:05:17.166
Hmm?

2:05:17.250 --> 2:05:20.416
Now that France is ours,
how much of her land is now yours?

2:05:23.166 --> 2:05:24.125
Oh, well...

2:05:25.000 --> 2:05:27.250
That has yet to be determined.

2:05:27.791 --> 2:05:29.583
Your conquest is so recent.

2:05:31.041 --> 2:05:33.833
-Why do you ask this question--
-Stay up there.

2:05:34.500 --> 2:05:36.458
-Hmm?
-Stay up there.

2:05:44.500 --> 2:05:45.625
Oh.

2:05:55.958 --> 2:05:57.791
How did my assassin come to you?

2:06:02.333 --> 2:06:04.041
I fail to remember the moment.

2:06:05.000 --> 2:06:06.250
Remedy this failure.

2:06:10.375 --> 2:06:12.958
So much has happened
in the intervening months.

2:06:13.041 --> 2:06:14.500
An event as pivotal as this one

2:06:14.583 --> 2:06:17.916
should be amply equipped
to penetrate the fog of time elapsed.

2:06:18.500 --> 2:06:19.333
No?

2:06:20.500 --> 2:06:21.416
Of course.

2:06:23.333 --> 2:06:24.583
Let me recall.

2:06:29.625 --> 2:06:30.958
Was it in the street?

2:06:33.166 --> 2:06:34.833
Did he come to you in the street?

2:06:35.958 --> 2:06:37.750
Yes. Yes, it was in the street.

2:06:37.833 --> 2:06:39.750
He approached me...

2:06:39.833 --> 2:06:41.541
most unusually.

2:06:42.041 --> 2:06:45.583
My liege, please, tell me
the cause of this concern.

2:06:45.666 --> 2:06:46.750
Stay up there.

2:06:50.041 --> 2:06:51.250
Stay up there.

2:07:02.791 --> 2:07:03.958
Did he know your name?

2:07:05.708 --> 2:07:06.833
I don't believe he did.

2:07:06.916 --> 2:07:09.541
How, then, did he know
who you were to approach?

2:07:14.500 --> 2:07:15.333
Ah.

2:07:17.666 --> 2:07:19.250
The memory is returning.

2:07:22.791 --> 2:07:25.041
He surrendered himself to palace guards

2:07:25.125 --> 2:07:27.041
and the matter
was brought to my attention.

2:07:27.125 --> 2:07:28.666
I was taken to him.

2:07:28.916 --> 2:07:30.500
So, he did not come to you in the street.

2:07:30.583 --> 2:07:33.541
No. No, it was not in the street.
Forgive me.

2:07:33.916 --> 2:07:35.583
I was summoned to his cell.

2:07:43.041 --> 2:07:45.416
Has a problem arisen...

2:07:46.750 --> 2:07:47.750
Hal?

2:07:48.083 --> 2:07:48.916
Yes.

2:07:49.458 --> 2:07:50.583
A problem has arisen.

2:07:51.333 --> 2:07:54.208
And it wobbles before me now
on its silly little stool

2:07:54.291 --> 2:07:56.791
-at mine own elevation.
-I'm afraid I don't understand.

2:07:56.875 --> 2:08:00.000
-Please, please, stop this charade.
-Sincerely, I do not understand.

2:08:00.083 --> 2:08:02.125
Stop the fucking charade!

2:08:02.208 --> 2:08:03.041
Stop it!

2:08:03.125 --> 2:08:05.708
I have given you
what you wanted, boy!

2:08:07.083 --> 2:08:08.250
Have I not?!

2:08:13.916 --> 2:08:14.916
Mm.

2:08:16.583 --> 2:08:17.416
Mm.

2:08:29.625 --> 2:08:31.458
You wanted peace.

2:08:31.916 --> 2:08:32.875
Did you not?!

2:08:39.166 --> 2:08:41.125
This is how peace is forged.

2:08:42.958 --> 2:08:45.583
It is forged in victory.

2:08:47.416 --> 2:08:48.250
Listen.

2:08:55.625 --> 2:08:57.583
That is the sound of peace.

2:09:02.500 --> 2:09:04.416
That is the sound of your peace.

2:09:14.208 --> 2:09:17.250
That is the sound of your greatness.

2:09:20.583 --> 2:09:21.416
Hmm?

2:09:59.666 --> 2:10:01.041
-My liege.
-My liege.

2:10:01.500 --> 2:10:02.541
My liege.

2:10:20.000 --> 2:10:21.666
I ask nothing of you...

2:10:24.500 --> 2:10:27.333
only that you will always
speak to me clear and true.

2:10:28.666 --> 2:10:29.541
Always.

2:10:33.041 --> 2:10:34.916
Will you promise me only that?

2:10:35.000 --> 2:10:36.875
Long live the King!

2:10:37.250 --> 2:10:39.250
- Long live the King!
-I will.

2:10:40.583 --> 2:10:41.875
Long live the King!

2:10:44.083 --> 2:10:45.750
Long live the King!

2:10:45.833 --> 2:10:47.958
Long live the King!

2:10:49.916 --> 2:10:51.583
King Henry!

2:10:51.666 --> 2:10:53.791
King Henry!

2:10:53.875 --> 2:10:55.458
King Henry!

2:10:56.125 --> 2:10:57.625
King Henry!

2:10:58.416 --> 2:10:59.833
King Henry!

2:11:00.583 --> 2:11:02.000
King Henry!

2:11:02.791 --> 2:11:04.250
King Henry!

2:11:04.958 --> 2:11:06.458
King Henry!

2:11:07.250 --> 2:11:08.750
King Henry!
