00:16.451 --> 00:17.843
OH, LUCKY?

00:17.887 --> 00:19.280
I JUST SUNK TWO 3s IN YOUR FACE.

00:19.323 --> 00:20.281
THAT'’S SKILLS.

OK, MY MAN,

00:23.371 --> 00:24.676
READY.
YOU REALLY READY?

00:24.720 --> 00:25.808
I'’M WAITING.

AH, HERE IT COMES.

00:27.244 --> 00:27.984

OH, YEAH!

00:32.162 --> 00:34.382
YEAH, RIGHT, BUT NO FOUL.
NICE TRY.

00:34.425 --> 00:35.861
COME ON, MAN,
GET YOUR ASS UP.

00:38.125 --> 00:40.214
JEEZ, MAN.
WHAT THE HELL?

00:49.788 --> 00:50.528
COME ON, LET'’S SEE
WHAT YOU'’VE GOT.

00:50.572 --> 00:51.921
PLAY SOME "D."

00:51.964 --> 00:53.923
COME ON, LET'’S GO.

00:56.752 --> 00:58.536
COME ON,
YOU GONNA SHOOT OR WHAT?

00:59.885 --> 01:01.800
READY FOR THIS,
OLD MAN?

01:03.846 --> 01:05.282
YOU HAD
YOUR DOUGHNUTS?

01:08.416 --> 01:10.331
OOH!

01:12.159 --> 01:13.116
GOOD DIG.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.031
YEAH. YEAH.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.380
THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE,

01:16.424 --> 01:18.252
THAT YOU CAN STILL
GET THAT MUCH AIR.

01:18.295 --> 01:20.143
I DID PLAY
A LITTLE COLLEGE HOOP
NOT TOO LONG AGO.

01:20.167 --> 01:22.125
YEAH, THAT WAS BEFORE
YOU HAD 5 KIDS.

01:22.169 --> 01:24.127
YEAH.

01:24.171 --> 01:25.911
IN SOME WAYS THE KIDS,

01:25.955 --> 01:27.348
THEIR ENERGY
KEEPS ME YOUNG.

01:27.391 --> 01:29.132
HMM.

01:29.176 --> 01:31.134
YEAH, WELL, WITH
ALL THE RUNNING AROUND,

01:31.178 --> 01:33.571
HOW DO YOU AND KRISTY
FIND THE TIME FOR EACH OTHER?

01:33.615 --> 01:35.356
IT TAKES EFFORT.

01:35.399 --> 01:38.141
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT MAKES
THE TIMES WE DO CARVE OUT

01:38.185 --> 01:39.553
FOR EACH OTHER THAT
MUCH MORE SPECIAL.

01:39.577 --> 01:41.362
I DON'’T KNOW IF
I COULD DO IT.

01:41.405 --> 01:44.016
BUT I DO KNOW THAT
I WANT A REMATCH.
OH?

01:44.060 --> 01:45.496
YEAH.
IN A BOXING RING.

01:45.540 --> 01:46.889
BOXING RING?
YEAH.

01:46.932 --> 01:48.717
OK.

01:52.286 --> 01:55.027
SO ALVEZ, I HEARD
YOU GOT SMOKED.

01:55.071 --> 01:58.553
HA HA HA!
I DID NOT GET SMOKED.

01:58.596 --> 02:01.512
YEAH, WELL, WE'’VE TAKEN
TO CALLING SIMMONS
THE BUS DRIVER

02:01.556 --> 02:03.558
BECAUSE HE TOOK YOU
TO SCHOOL.

02:05.168 --> 02:07.170
HE KIND OF DID.

02:07.214 --> 02:09.433
HE'’S ALSO BEEN OFF
FOR THE PAST MONTH.

02:09.477 --> 02:11.914
HE'’S SLEPT IN.
HE'’S WORKING OUT.

02:11.957 --> 02:13.698
WHOA, HE'’S GOT
A NEWBORN BABY

02:13.742 --> 02:15.004
AND 4 KIDS
TO CORRAL.

02:15.047 --> 02:16.440
I DON'’T THINK
SO, BUDDY.

02:16.484 --> 02:18.312
SERIOUSLY,
YOU GOT MORE SLEEP
LAST NIGHT

02:18.355 --> 02:20.270
THAN MATT'’S HAD
IN A MONTH.

02:20.314 --> 02:21.967
THAT'’S ACTUALLY
NOT AN EXAGGERATION.

02:22.011 --> 02:23.404
RESEARCH STUDIES
HAVE SHOWN

02:23.447 --> 02:25.077
THAT IN THE FIRST
12 MONTHS OF
A CHILD'’S LIFE,

02:25.101 --> 02:27.059
PARENTS SLEEP LESS
THAN 59%

02:27.103 --> 02:28.626
OF THE RECOMMENDED
8 HOURS A NIGHT,

02:28.670 --> 02:29.845
HENCE LOSING
THE EQUIVALENT

02:29.888 --> 02:31.977
OF ON AVERAGE,
50 NIGHTS OF SLEEP.

02:32.021 --> 02:34.806
DO YOU HAVE ANY STATS
THAT MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP ME?

02:34.850 --> 02:36.721
NOPE.

02:36.765 --> 02:38.680
IT'’S HAPPENING AGAIN.

02:38.723 --> 02:40.116
WE GOT A...

02:43.119 --> 02:46.470
THESE WAS A DOUBLE
HOMICIDE THIS MORNING
IN DES PLAINES, ILLINOIS.

02:46.514 --> 02:49.691
IT APPEARS OUR VICTIMS,
MARKO SALAZAR AND
BENJAMIN BLAKE,

02:49.734 --> 02:52.215
WERE SHOT BY A SNIPER
WHILE PLAYING BASKETBALL

02:52.259 --> 02:53.434
ON A NEIGHBORHOOD COURT.

02:53.477 --> 02:54.652
DES PLAINES, ILLINOIS?

02:54.696 --> 02:56.306
I KNOW
WHAT'’S IN YOUR NOGGIN,

02:56.350 --> 02:57.718
AND WHAT IS IN YOUR
NOGGIN IS CORRECT TO
BE IN YOUR NOGGIN

02:57.742 --> 03:00.136
BECAUSE TWO DAYS AGO
A GENTLEMAN NAMED BRIAN NIKOLAY

03:00.180 --> 03:03.226
WAS SHOT IN A PARKING LOT
BY A SNIPER.

03:03.270 --> 03:04.880
JUST LIKE THE
PHILLIP DOWD CASE

03:04.923 --> 03:06.577
WE WORKED
IN DES PLAINES
15 YEARS AGO.

03:06.621 --> 03:08.884
IT IS. ALL SINGLE SHOTS
TO THE VICTIMS'’ TORSOS,

03:08.927 --> 03:10.731
ALL IN PUBLIC PLACES,
AND NO ONE'’S SEEN THE SHOOTER.

03:10.755 --> 03:12.235
HE'’S A GHOST.

03:12.279 --> 03:13.386
THERE'’S NO WAY
IT'’S THE SAME

03:13.410 --> 03:15.238
LONG-DISTANCE
SERIAL KILLER
BECAUSE...

03:15.282 --> 03:16.892
BECAUSE I KILLED
PHILLIP DOWD.

03:19.068 --> 03:22.071
SO YOU THINK IT'’S
A COPYCAT LDSK?

03:22.114 --> 03:25.944
TYPICALLY, LDSKs
ARE SKILLED MARKSMEN
WITH A GOD COMPLEX.

03:25.988 --> 03:27.990
AND THEY PRETTY MUCH
REVEL IN TAKING
PEOPLE'’S LIVES

03:28.033 --> 03:29.426
FROM ABOVE AND AFAR.

03:29.470 --> 03:32.386
BUT COPYCATS ARE
OUT TO PROVE
THEIR SUPERIORITY

03:32.429 --> 03:34.431
BY MAKING
A BIGGER BANG.

03:34.475 --> 03:37.434
OR TO RIDE THE WAVE
OF INFAMY CREATED BY
THE ORIGINAL KILLER.

03:37.478 --> 03:38.933
BUT IN THIS CASE,
THE ORIGINAL KILLER,

03:38.957 --> 03:40.568
PHILLIP DOWD,
IS A DISTANT MEMORY.

03:40.611 --> 03:42.396
THERE'’S NOT MUCH
OF A WAVE TO RIDE.

03:42.439 --> 03:44.156
DOWD'’S ORIGINAL M.O.
WAS TO SHOOT HIS VICTIMS,

03:44.180 --> 03:46.269
THEN RACE BACK TO
THE EMERGENCY ROOM
WHERE HE WORKED

03:46.313 --> 03:47.507
'’CAUSE HE THRIVED ON
TRYING TO SAVE THEM.

03:47.531 --> 03:50.055
YEAH, TYPICAL
HERO HOMICIDES.

03:50.099 --> 03:51.753
BUT WE'’RE NOT
SEEING THAT HERE.

03:51.796 --> 03:53.276
NO, WE'’RE NOT,

03:53.320 --> 03:55.278
BUT THIS UNSUB'’S
VICTIMOLOGY

03:55.322 --> 03:56.473
IS REMAINING
CONSISTENT ENOUGH

03:56.497 --> 03:58.760
TO SUGGEST THAT
HIS NEXT VICTIMS

03:58.803 --> 04:02.198
WILL MOST LIKELY BE
3 VISITORS TO ONE
OF THE LOCAL PARKS.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.480
I'’LL MAKE SURE
CHIEF WEIGART
HAS HIS OFFICERS

04:03.504 --> 04:04.461
STAKE OUT THE PARKS.

04:04.505 --> 04:05.699
PENELOPE, WILL YOU
LET MATT KNOW

04:05.723 --> 04:07.116
THAT IT'’S ALL
HANDS ON DECK?

04:07.159 --> 04:08.378
WE ARE WHEELS UP
IN TWENTY.

04:15.646 --> 04:17.300
HI, JORDY!

04:17.344 --> 04:18.345
HEY, THERE, BUDDY.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.046
THAT WILL WORK.

04:24.089 --> 04:25.569
HEY.
EVERYTHING GOOD?

04:25.613 --> 04:27.049
TERRIFIC, THANKS.

04:27.092 --> 04:29.007
YOU KNOW, WE DON'’T HAVE
HONEY LAVENDER LATTES

04:29.051 --> 04:30.835
LIKE THIS BACK HOME.

04:30.879 --> 04:33.079
WELL, THEN I'’LL JUST
HAVE TO GET YOU
TWO MORE, WON'’T I?

04:44.675 --> 04:46.286
ARE YOU OK?

04:47.678 --> 04:49.114
OH, NO!

04:49.158 --> 04:51.334
HELLO? THERE'’S
A MAN HERE,

04:51.378 --> 04:52.466
AND HE'’S BLEEDING.

04:52.509 --> 04:53.530
JUST PLEASE GET HERE
AS SOON AS YOU CAN.

04:53.554 --> 04:54.554
OH, MY GOD!

04:58.515 --> 05:01.301
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
ABC STUDIOS, LLC AND CBS, INC.

05:29.154 --> 05:31.026
"NOW I KNOW
WHAT A GHOST IS.

05:31.069 --> 05:33.855
UNFINISHED BUSINESS,
THAT'’S WHAT."

05:33.898 --> 05:36.336
SALMAN RUSHDIE.

05:36.379 --> 05:38.425
GUYS, THERE'’S
BEEN ANOTHER SHOOTING.

05:38.468 --> 05:42.342
THIS NEW LDSK IS STICKING
TO THE VICTIMOLOGY,

05:42.385 --> 05:44.039
BUT HE'’S MOVING
SUPER FAST.

05:44.082 --> 05:46.147
IN THE LAST 3 DAYS,
THERE'’S BEEN 3
SHOOTING INCIDENTS,

05:46.171 --> 05:48.304
6 VICTIMS SO FAR.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.219
THAT TOOK DOWD
OVER TWO WEEKS.

05:50.262 --> 05:52.526
SO FOR SOME REASON,
THIS UNSUB FEELS
THE NEED TO MIMIC

05:52.569 --> 05:54.832
THE ORIGINAL
CRIMES BUT AT AN
ACCELERATED PACE.

05:54.876 --> 05:57.444
LUCKILY, LOCAL PD
WAS ALREADY ON
THE WAY TO THE PARK.

05:57.487 --> 05:59.010
THEY ADMINISTERED CPR
TO THE VICTIMS.

05:59.054 --> 06:01.361
THEY MANAGED TO SAVE
TWO OF THE THREE,

06:01.404 --> 06:03.101
BUT BOTH OF THEM ARE
IN SURGERY RIGHT NOW

06:03.145 --> 06:04.451
FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES.

06:04.494 --> 06:06.191
THE TWO SURVIVING
VICTIMS ARE KAREN WOLF,

06:06.235 --> 06:08.237
AN ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON,
AND HER HUSBAND CRAIG.

06:08.280 --> 06:10.195
THEY WERE HAVING COFFEE
AT AN OUTDOOR CAFE

06:10.239 --> 06:11.545
IN McCARTY MEMORIAL PARK.

06:11.588 --> 06:14.069
THE VICTIM WHO DIED
WAS TIMOTHY DONOVAN.

06:14.112 --> 06:15.723
HE WAS A GROUNDSKEEPER.

06:15.766 --> 06:18.856
SO THE AGES AND ETHNICITIES
OF THESE CURRENT VICTIMS

06:18.900 --> 06:21.250
DON'’T EXACTLY MATCH
THE PAST VICTIMS'’,

06:21.293 --> 06:23.818
BUT THE GENDERS AND LOCATION
TYPES ARE THE SAME.

06:23.861 --> 06:25.863
ALSO, SAME INCREASING
NUMBER OF VICTIMS

06:25.907 --> 06:27.517
IN BOTH CASES.

06:27.561 --> 06:29.563
EXCEPT IT SEEMS LIKE
THIS UNSUB MERGED

06:29.606 --> 06:32.043
PHILLIP DOWD'’S PARK
AND CAFEÉ SHOOTINGS

06:32.087 --> 06:33.480
INTO A SINGLE EVENT.

06:33.523 --> 06:35.283
GUYS, IF THAT'’S TRUE
AND THIS UNSUB CONTINUES

06:35.307 --> 06:36.744
TO FOLLOW THE OVERALL
VICTIMOLOGY,

06:36.787 --> 06:38.615
THE LAST PERSON THAT
PHILLIP DOWD SHOT

06:38.659 --> 06:40.878
IN THE ORIGINAL SERIES
WAS McCARTY,

06:40.922 --> 06:43.403
A LOCAL COP THAT
THIS PARK WAS NAMED AFTER.

06:43.446 --> 06:46.493
GARCIA, I NEED YOU TO
NOTIFY COMMANDER RUSH
AT THE HRT.

06:46.536 --> 06:49.191
WE'’RE GONNA NEED
THEIR HELP SETTING UP
COUNTER-SNIPER OPERATIONS.

06:49.234 --> 06:52.586
YEAH, LOCAL COPS
ARE GONNA NEED THEIR
OWN SECURITY DETAILS.

06:52.629 --> 06:54.762
DAVE, TAKE SPENCER
AND TARA WITH YOU

06:54.805 --> 06:56.285
TO THE M.E.'’s
OFFICE.

06:56.328 --> 06:57.112
I'’M SURE SHE'S GOT
HER HANDS FULL.

06:57.155 --> 06:58.853
MATT, LUKE, JJ,

06:58.896 --> 07:00.724
WE'’LL COORDINATE
WITH CHIEF WEIGART

07:00.768 --> 07:02.093
AT THE MOBILE COMMAND CENTER
THAT THEY JUST SET UP

07:02.117 --> 07:04.119
AT THE LATEST CRIME SCENE.

07:10.952 --> 07:11.996
CHIEF WEIGART.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.215
UNIT CHIEF PRENTISS.

07:13.258 --> 07:15.173
YOU REMEMBER
SSA JAREAU.

07:15.217 --> 07:17.915
THESE ARE AGENTS
ALVEZ AND SIMMONS.

07:17.959 --> 07:19.787
I SEE YOU'’VE ALREADY
MET HRT COMMANDER RUSH.

07:19.830 --> 07:22.529
YES. WE GREATLY APPRECIATE
ALL THE HELP WE CAN GET.

07:22.572 --> 07:24.922
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE,
THINGS AROUND HERE
ARE PRETTY TENSE.

07:24.966 --> 07:27.185
MY OFFICERS ARE
WELL AWARE THAT
THEY'’RE LIKELY

07:27.229 --> 07:29.057
THIS GUY'’S NEXT TARGET.

07:29.100 --> 07:31.581
THAT'’S WHY EMILY
ASKED US TO COME
BACK UP YOUR UNITS.

07:31.625 --> 07:33.627
SCOTT WAS
A DEDICATED OFFICER,

07:33.670 --> 07:35.846
AND I CAN'’T LET THIS
HAPPEN TO ANY OF
MY OTHER PEOPLE.

07:35.890 --> 07:37.892
CHIEF, THAT
WASN'’T YOUR FAULT.

07:37.935 --> 07:39.415
DOWD TARGETED
THE INVESTIGATION

07:39.459 --> 07:41.286
BECAUSE HE KNEW WE
WERE GETTING CLOSE.

07:41.330 --> 07:43.506
BUT WE'’RE IN THE SAME
DAMN SITUATION NOW,
AREN'’T WE?

07:43.550 --> 07:44.962
THE DIFFERENCE
IS WE'’RE HERE
TO MAKE SURE

07:44.986 --> 07:46.814
THAT DOESN'’T
HAPPEN AGAIN.

07:46.857 --> 07:48.555
WE KNOW HE'’S COMING,
AND WE'’RE READY.

07:48.598 --> 07:50.339
HRT'’s COUNTER-SNIPER OPERATORS

07:50.382 --> 07:51.742
WILL BE BACKING YOU UP
ALL THE WAY.

07:51.775 --> 07:53.211
THAT'’S RIGHT.
WE ALREADY DEPLOYED

07:53.255 --> 07:56.127
MY ALPHA, BRAVO, AND
CHARLIE TEAMS HERE
AND AROUND TOWN.

07:56.171 --> 07:57.540
CHIEF, YOUR
INITIAL REPORT OF
THE SHOOTING HERE,

07:57.564 --> 07:59.174
YOU MENTIONED WITNESSES.

07:59.217 --> 08:01.481
YEAH, DIANA LIPSCOMBE
AND PETER CHARLES.

08:01.524 --> 08:03.570
NEITHER ONE OF THEM
SAW THE SHOOTER.

08:03.613 --> 08:06.529
BUT DIANE IS
RIGHT OVER THERE,
READY TO TALK.

08:06.573 --> 08:08.139
OK, SHE MAY HAVE
SEEN SOMETHING

08:08.183 --> 08:09.576
THAT COULD BE
HELPFUL TO US.

08:09.619 --> 08:12.187
MATT, LUKE, GO
TALK TO DIANE AND
ASSESS THE SCENE.

08:12.230 --> 08:15.495
JJ AND I WILL WORK
WITH COMMANDER RUSH
ON LOGISTICS.

08:15.538 --> 08:17.540
WE'’LL ALSO BRING
IN FRIENDS AND
FAMILY MEMBERS

08:17.584 --> 08:19.368
OF THE VICTIMS
FOR INTERVIEWS.

08:22.327 --> 08:23.546
MS. LIPSCOMBE? DIANE: YES.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.200
WE'’RE WITH THE FBI.

08:25.243 --> 08:26.873
WE KNOW YOU'’VE ALREADY
GIVEN A STATEMENT
TO THE POLICE,

08:26.897 --> 08:29.073
BUT WE'’D LIKE TO
ASK YOU A FEW MORE
QUESTIONS

08:29.117 --> 08:30.118
IF THAT'’S
ALL RIGHT.

08:30.161 --> 08:31.946
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

08:31.989 --> 08:33.687
I WAS READING OVER
THERE ON THE BENCH.

08:33.730 --> 08:37.038
AND I HEARD THE MAN
ON THE LAWNMOWER

08:37.081 --> 08:40.084
YELL HELLO TO THIS
YOUNG LADY WHO WAS
WALKING HER DOG.

08:42.391 --> 08:44.872
AND THEN I DON'’T KNOW.

08:44.915 --> 08:48.179
I LOOKED UP AND THE MAN
WAS LYING ON THE GROUND
THERE BLEEDING.

08:48.223 --> 08:49.833
SO I CALLED 911.

08:49.877 --> 08:51.922
DID YOU HEAR
ANY SHOTS FIRED?

08:51.966 --> 08:53.663
SORRY, NO.

08:53.707 --> 08:55.578
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
THAT STOOD OUT TO YOU?

08:55.622 --> 08:57.188
ANYTHING AT ALL?

08:57.232 --> 09:00.583
UM, THERE WAS A LOT
OF COMMOTION OVER HERE
AT THIS KIOSK,

09:00.627 --> 09:02.498
BUT THAT'’S ABOUT IT.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.805
I WISH I COULD
HELP YOU MORE.

09:04.848 --> 09:06.589
THAT'’S FINE.
THANK YOU.

09:06.633 --> 09:09.940
CAN YOU PLEASE
MAKE SURE SHE GETS
HOME SAFELY?

09:13.988 --> 09:15.598
IT'’S INTERESTING.

09:15.642 --> 09:17.557
SHE WAS ABLE TO HEAR
THIS VICTIM SAY HELLO

09:17.600 --> 09:19.471
OVER THE SOUND OF
THE MOWER,

09:19.515 --> 09:20.951
BUT DIDN'’T HEAR ANY
SHOTS FIRED.

09:20.995 --> 09:22.562
YEAH.

09:22.605 --> 09:25.695
EXIT WOUND IS IN THE
RIGHT ANTERIOR ABDOMEN.

09:25.739 --> 09:29.481
ENTRY WOUND IS IN
THE LEFT POSTERIOR
LOWER BACK.

09:29.525 --> 09:32.223
SO THAT MEANS BASED ON
THE ANGLE OF THE ENTRY WOUND

09:32.267 --> 09:34.617
AND THE DIRECTION
THE MOWER WAS TRAVELING,

09:34.661 --> 09:36.663
THE UNSUB FIRED THE SHOTS
FROM OVER THERE.

09:36.706 --> 09:39.274
ALL 3 VICTIMS WERE
SHOT JUST SEVERAL YARDS

09:39.317 --> 09:42.277
OFF OF THE ROAD,
RIGHT HERE AND OVER
AT THE CAFEÉ.

09:42.320 --> 09:45.193
IN THE ORIGINAL CASE,
PHILLIP DOWD CONCEALED HIMSELF

09:45.236 --> 09:48.500
IN THE TRUNK OF
HIS SEDAN AND FIRED
THE SHOTS FROM THERE.

09:48.544 --> 09:50.198
BUT THOSE CARS
AND THOSE SHRUBS

09:50.241 --> 09:52.679
WOULD BLOCK THE LINE
OF FIRE IF THE UNSUB
TRIED THAT HERE.

09:52.722 --> 09:54.768
THERE'’S NO PLACE
FOR A SHOOTER

09:54.811 --> 09:56.659
TO HAVE TAKEN
A POSITION TO COMPLETELY
CONCEAL HIMSELF,

09:56.683 --> 09:58.815
NOT ACROSS THE STREET
OR OVER ON THE HILL.

09:58.859 --> 10:01.165
NOT TO MENTION,
THE ANGLES WOULD
BE WRONG.

10:01.209 --> 10:02.514
YEAH, THEY WOULD.

10:02.558 --> 10:03.646
SOMETHING'’S WAY OFF.

10:03.690 --> 10:05.343
YEAH, LIKE MAYBE
WE'’RE NOT DEALING

10:05.387 --> 10:07.128
WITH A LONG-DISTANCE
SERIAL KILLER.

10:16.833 --> 10:19.401
ALL 3 VICTIMS WERE
SHOT WITH 9 MILLIMETERS,

10:19.444 --> 10:21.621
NOT A RIFLE.

10:21.664 --> 10:22.728
THEN THE UNSUB
WE'’RE LOOKING AT

10:22.752 --> 10:24.362
IS ACTUALLY A
SHORT-RANGE KILLER.

10:24.406 --> 10:27.017
WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT
DEVIATION FROM
THE ORIGINAL CASE.

10:27.061 --> 10:29.411
I SENT THE RECOVERED SLUGS
FOR BALLISTIC ANALYSIS.

10:29.454 --> 10:31.500
MY ASSISTANT SHOULD HAVE
THE RESULTS SHORTLY.

10:31.543 --> 10:33.502
ANYTHING SPECIAL
ABOUT THE ROUNDS?

10:33.545 --> 10:35.156
THEY WERE HOLLOW POINTS.

10:35.199 --> 10:36.679
AND AS I'’M SURE
YOU'’RE WELL AWARE,

10:36.723 --> 10:38.594
THOSE ARE DESIGNED
TO EXPAND ON IMPACT.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.074
THAT'’S ANOTHER
DEVIATION.

10:40.117 --> 10:41.486
THIS UNSUB HAS NO
INTEREST IN SEEING

10:41.510 --> 10:42.816
IF HE CAN SAVE
THE VICTIMS.

10:42.859 --> 10:44.078
HE HAS EVERY
INTENTION

10:44.121 --> 10:45.688
OF KILLING THEM
WITH A SINGLE SHOT.

10:45.732 --> 10:48.169
DR. ZAMBETTI,
HERE YOU GO.

10:48.212 --> 10:50.432
HERE'’S THE
BALLISTICS REPORT.

10:53.174 --> 10:56.307
IT SAYS TWO GUNS WERE USED
AT THE McCARTY PARK SCENE...

10:56.351 --> 10:59.659
TWO GUNS OUTFITTED
WITH SILENCERS.

10:59.702 --> 11:03.053
WELL, MULTIPLE GUNS
COULD VERY WELL MEAN
MULTIPLE UNSUBS.

11:03.097 --> 11:04.838
I'’LL LET EMILY KNOW.

11:04.881 --> 11:09.886
I CAN'’T THINK OF
A SINGLE PERSON WHO
HAD A BEEF WITH MARKO.

11:09.930 --> 11:13.847
I MEAN, MY BROTHER WAS
JUST AN EASY-GOING KIND OF GUY.

11:13.890 --> 11:16.066
SO THERE WASN'’T ANYONE
WHO EXPRESSED ANGER

11:16.110 --> 11:18.895
OR JEALOUSY WHEN
YOUR BROTHER GOT HIS
BASKETBALL SCHOLARSHIP?

11:18.939 --> 11:21.071
NO WAY.

11:21.115 --> 11:23.508
THE WHOLE DAMN NEIGHBORHOOD
SHOWED UP FOR THE CELEBRATION.

11:23.552 --> 11:25.641
EVERYBODY I KNOW...

11:28.078 --> 11:29.689
WAS JUST SO PROUD
OF MARKO.

11:31.168 --> 11:33.214
SORRY.

11:33.257 --> 11:35.825
PETER,
DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING
DR. OR MR. WOLF SAID

11:35.869 --> 11:37.697
THAT MIGHT HELP US
UNDERSTAND

11:37.740 --> 11:39.568
WHY THEY WERE TARGETED
IN THIS ATTACK?

11:39.611 --> 11:42.092
ALL I KNOW IS THEY SAID
IT WAS A KIND OF

11:42.136 --> 11:44.529
SPUR-OF-MOMENT TRIP
FROM OUT OF TOWN,

11:44.573 --> 11:47.707
BUT THEY DIDN'’T
SAY FROM WHERE,

11:47.750 --> 11:51.449
JUST THAT THEY DIDN'’T KNOW
ANYBODY FROM AROUND HERE.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.716
I WAS STANDING
RIGHT NEXT TO THEM.

11:58.674 --> 12:01.851
WAS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
THAT YOU NOTICED?

12:01.895 --> 12:06.638
I HEARD THAT WOMAN
SCREAM OVER BY THE LAWNMOWER

12:06.682 --> 12:08.597
AROUND THE SAME TIME.

12:10.294 --> 12:12.253
ACCORDING TO OUR
EYEWITNESSES,

12:12.296 --> 12:13.360
THE SHOOTINGS IN McCARTY PARK

12:13.384 --> 12:14.951
WERE NEARLY
SIMULTANEOUS.

12:14.995 --> 12:16.474
COUPLE THAT WITH
THE BALLISTICS,

12:16.518 --> 12:18.061
AND WE'’RE LOOKING AT
AT LEAST TWO SHOOTERS.

12:18.085 --> 12:19.434
CLOSE-RANGE SHOOTERS,

12:19.477 --> 12:20.957
WHICH WOULD TYPICALLY
MEAN THE UNSUBS

12:21.001 --> 12:22.630
HAVE SOME SORT OF
CONNECTION WITH THE VICTIMS,

12:22.654 --> 12:24.458
BUT IN THIS CASE, THAT
DOESN'’T SEEM TO BE TRUE.

12:24.482 --> 12:27.355
SO WHO'’S THE REAL TARGET
OF THE UNSUBS'’ RAGE HERE?

12:27.398 --> 12:29.966
WELL, WHOEVER IT IS,
COMBINING THE LAST TWO
SHOOTINGS INTO ONE

12:30.010 --> 12:31.576
MAKE IT SEEM LIKE
THEY'’RE IN A BIG RUSH

12:31.620 --> 12:33.317
TO GET TO THEIR
NEXT TARGET...

12:33.361 --> 12:34.710
ONE OF CHIEF WEIGART'’S MEN.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.146
EVEN WITH HRT
BACKING THEM UP,

12:36.190 --> 12:38.235
THERE'’S NO GUARANTEE
WE CAN PROTECT THEM.

12:38.279 --> 12:39.517
WELL, IT'’S STARTING
TO FEEL LIKE THAT
WAS THE POINT

12:39.541 --> 12:40.803
IN COPYING DOWD'’S M.O.,

12:40.847 --> 12:42.283
TO FORCE LOCAL POLICE
TO COME OUT

12:42.326 --> 12:44.111
AND MAKE THEMSELVES
VULNERABLE.

12:44.154 --> 12:45.852
WE GOT AN ANONYMOUS TIP
FROM SOMEBODY

12:45.895 --> 12:47.264
WHO'’S CLAIMING THEY SAW
THE SHOOTERS

12:47.288 --> 12:48.898
LEAVE McCARTY PARK
IN A GRAY SEDAN.

12:48.942 --> 12:51.814
DOWD USED A GRAY SEDAN.

12:51.858 --> 12:52.878
YOU THINK
THE CALL'’S LEGIT?

12:52.902 --> 12:54.208
WE HAVE TO
CHECK IT OUT.

12:54.251 --> 12:55.687
THE CALLER SAID HE
FOLLOWED A SEDAN

12:55.731 --> 12:58.212
TO AN APARTMENT COMPLEX
NEAR THE INTERSECTION

12:58.255 --> 12:59.909
OF DENTON AND
OAKHURST ROADS.

12:59.953 --> 13:01.321
DOWD'’S OLD APARTMENT
IS NEAR THERE.

13:01.345 --> 13:03.521
WE NEED TO APPROACH
THAT LOCATION WITH CAUTION.

13:03.565 --> 13:04.958
I AGREE.

13:05.001 --> 13:06.283
COMMANDER RUSH, CAN YOU
GET YOUR MEN OUT THERE

13:06.307 --> 13:07.134
AND SET UP
A SECURE PERIMETER?

13:07.177 --> 13:08.570
YOU GOT IT.

13:08.613 --> 13:09.852
MATT, LUKE, TARA,
I WANT YOU TO KEEP

13:09.876 --> 13:11.834
A LOOSE TAIL
ON CHIEF WEIGART.

13:11.878 --> 13:14.402
I'’M WORRIED SINCE
HE WAS PART OF
THE ORIGINAL CASE,

13:14.445 --> 13:16.360
HE MAY BE OUR UNSUB'’S
ULTIMATE TARGET.

13:16.404 --> 13:17.684
LOOK, I'’D RATHER
TAKE THE BULLET

13:17.709 --> 13:19.494
THAN ANY ONE OF
MY OFFICERS.

13:19.537 --> 13:20.688
WE'’RE HERE TO MAKE SURE
THAT DOESN'’T HAPPEN.

13:20.712 --> 13:23.106
THANKS. OK.

13:23.150 --> 13:24.281
LET'’S ROLL.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.813
UNDERSTOOD. READY
WHEN YOU ARE, BOSS.

13:33.856 --> 13:35.815
ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE,
LET'’S LOAD UP.

13:53.571 --> 13:56.661
PRENTISS, WE'’RE CURRENTLY
EXITING 14 TO NORTHRUP.
RUNNING 10-40.

13:56.705 --> 13:58.228
COPY.

14:11.981 --> 14:12.939
GRENADE!

14:12.982 --> 14:14.027
COVER!

14:43.665 --> 14:45.885
NO, NO, NO, IT'’S ME.
IT'’S JJ.

14:48.975 --> 14:50.541
IT'’S ME.

14:52.413 --> 14:53.936
LUKE.

14:53.980 --> 14:55.024
LUKE... LUKE AND MATT.

14:55.068 --> 14:56.591
TAKE CARE OF TARA.

14:56.634 --> 14:57.548
WE'’LL CHECK
THE SUV.

14:57.592 --> 14:59.855
MEDICAL!

15:01.335 --> 15:02.858
THEY TOOK
LUKE AND MATT.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.947
WHY NOT TAKE TARA?

15:07.994 --> 15:11.214
MATT SIMMONS, WHY ARE YOU
STOPPED ON AN OFF RAMP

15:11.258 --> 15:12.757
AND WHY AREN'’T YOU
ANSWERING YOUR PHONE?

15:12.781 --> 15:14.381
PICK UP.
PLEASE, PICK UP.
PLEASE, PICK UP.

15:15.784 --> 15:17.438
THANK GOD, MATT.

15:17.481 --> 15:20.049
IT'’S ME, PENELOPE.
THEY WERE AMBUSHED.

15:20.093 --> 15:22.312
TARA'’S HERE.
SHE'’S OK.

15:22.356 --> 15:23.531
THE BOYS ARE GONE.

15:23.574 --> 15:24.793
NO, THIS ISN'’T HAPPENING.

15:24.836 --> 15:26.031
PENELOPE, WE HAVE TO
GET A HANDLE

15:26.055 --> 15:27.361
ON WHAT'’S HAPPENING HERE.

15:27.404 --> 15:28.816
WE'’LL GET BACK TO YOU
AS SOON AS WE CAN.

15:28.840 --> 15:29.929
SIR, PLEASE FIND THEM.

15:29.972 --> 15:32.801
DON'’T WORRY, WE WILL.

15:32.844 --> 15:35.543
WHOEVER DID THIS MADE
SURE WE COULDN'’T TRACK
THEM USING GPS.

15:46.249 --> 15:47.337
NO, NO, WE CAN'’T GO.

15:47.381 --> 15:48.991
TARA.

15:49.035 --> 15:50.621
I HAVE TO HELP.
I HAVE TO HELP LUKE AND MATT.

15:50.645 --> 15:51.796
HEY, THEY'’RE GONNA
BE ALL RIGHT.

15:51.820 --> 15:53.140
WE'’RE TAKING YOU
TO THE HOSPITAL.

15:53.169 --> 15:55.476
PLEASE, WILL YOU LET
THIS MAN HELP YOU?

15:56.999 --> 16:00.655
JJ... JJ, PLEASE.

16:00.698 --> 16:02.744
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME FOCUS.

16:02.787 --> 16:04.224
YOU HAVE TO TALK ME
THROUGH IT.

16:04.267 --> 16:06.008
ARE YOU SURE?

16:06.052 --> 16:09.620
YES. I HAVE TO TRY.

16:09.664 --> 16:11.971
I KNOW I MUST HAVE
SEEN WHO DID THIS.

16:14.016 --> 16:15.887
OK.

16:15.931 --> 16:17.367
THESE UNSUBS
ARE SOPHISTICATED.

16:17.411 --> 16:18.847
THEY DEPLOYED
LACHRYMATORY AGENTS,

16:18.890 --> 16:20.805
AS WELL AS
PHENACYL CHLORIDE,

16:20.849 --> 16:23.765
A TYPE OF FLASH
GRENADE FILLED WITH CN
GAS AND PEPPER SPRAY.

16:23.808 --> 16:26.898
THAT ANONYMOUS CALL
WE GOT WAS JUST A PLOY.

16:26.942 --> 16:29.162
WHEN WE GOT OUT THERE,
THERE WAS NO SEDAN, NOTHING.

16:29.205 --> 16:30.990
YEAH, IT WAS ALL PART
OF THE PLAN.

16:31.033 --> 16:33.818
A PLAN THAT WE
ORIGINALLY THOUGHT
WAS TO TARGET YOU.

16:33.862 --> 16:36.343
BUT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE
THEY WANTED TO TAKE
A SHOT AT THE FBI.

16:36.386 --> 16:38.258
EXCEPT THEY DIDN'’T
ACTUALLY TAKE ANY SHOTS.

16:38.301 --> 16:41.000
I MEAN, THIS IS A TOTAL
CONTRADICTION OF
THEIR INITIAL M.O.

16:41.043 --> 16:42.697
THEY'’VE GONE FROM SHOOTERS
TO ABDUCTORS.

16:42.740 --> 16:43.740
IT DOESN'’T MAKE SENSE.

16:46.266 --> 16:48.268
DAVE, WHAT HAPPENED?

16:48.311 --> 16:49.878
THE BOYS ARE GONE.

16:49.921 --> 16:51.987
TARA'’S PRETTY BANGED UP
AND ON HER WAY TO THE HOSPITAL.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.371
COMMANDER RUSH AND I
ARE GONNA MAKE OUR WAY
TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

16:54.404 --> 16:56.798
THAT CRIME SCENE IS
OUR NEW GROUND ZERO.

16:56.841 --> 16:58.017
I'’M TELLING YOU, EMILY,

16:58.060 --> 17:00.497
I THINK ALL THESE COPY CAT
KILLINGS ARE RUSE.

17:00.541 --> 17:03.413
TO TARGET THE FBI, THE BAU?

17:03.457 --> 17:05.807
LOOKS THAT WAY.
MAYBE EVEN TO TARGET THE BOYS.

17:05.850 --> 17:08.070
THINK ABOUT IT.
THEY COPIED A CASE
WE WORKED ON BEFORE,

17:08.114 --> 17:09.289
ACCELERATED
THE TIME LINE,

17:09.332 --> 17:11.030
AND MADE SURE WE WERE
ALL OUT IN THE OPEN.

17:11.073 --> 17:12.683
YOU'’RE RIGHT.

17:12.727 --> 17:14.424
AND AS RELIEVED AS I AM

17:14.468 --> 17:16.687
THEY DIDN'’T KILL
MATT AND LUKE ON THE SPOT,

17:16.731 --> 17:19.081
IT MEANS THEY'’VE GOT
EVEN WORSE PLANS FOR THEM.

17:21.170 --> 17:23.390
OK, TARA.
JUST RELAX.

17:23.433 --> 17:24.956
OK.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.480
SO CLOSE YOUR EYES,

17:26.523 --> 17:28.438
TAKE A DEEP BREATH,

17:28.482 --> 17:32.312
AND TAKE YOURSELF BACK
TO THE MOMENTS BEFORE.

17:32.355 --> 17:35.097
YOU'’RE IN THE SUV.

17:35.141 --> 17:37.099
YOU'’RE FOLLOWING
CHIEF WEIGART.

17:39.362 --> 17:41.103
YEAH,
THEY'’RE AHEAD OF US.

17:41.147 --> 17:44.367
AND THEN HE TURNED
AT A STOP SIGN.

17:44.411 --> 17:46.326
AND THAT'’S WHEN THE VAN
CUT IN FRONT OF US.

17:46.369 --> 17:49.633
COULD YOU SEE WHO
WAS DRIVING THE VAN?

17:49.677 --> 17:51.461
NO.

17:51.505 --> 17:53.724
BUT I CAN HEAR SOMETHING.

17:53.768 --> 17:55.857
I CAN SEE A MOTORCYCLE.

17:55.900 --> 17:56.945
THERE WAS
A MOTORCYCLE?

17:56.988 --> 17:58.555
THERE WERE TWO MOTORCYCLES.

18:00.514 --> 18:02.081
THE WINDOW SHATTERED.

18:02.124 --> 18:04.039
CAN YOU SEE
THE RIDERS?

18:05.562 --> 18:07.651
BLACK LEATHER, HELMETS.

18:07.695 --> 18:09.653
NOTHING THAT
STANDS OUT TO ME.

18:09.697 --> 18:13.353
BUT THERE'’S SMOKE,
AND LUKE TRIED TO FIGHT.

18:13.396 --> 18:16.095
THEY INJECTED HIM.
THEY DRUGGED HIM.

18:16.138 --> 18:18.749
DID THEY EVER
SAY ANYTHING?

18:18.793 --> 18:22.536
YES. "NOT HER,
ALVEZ AND SIMMONS."

18:22.579 --> 18:24.799
THEY'’RE PULLING THEM
OUT OF THE CAR.

18:29.369 --> 18:32.023
HE HAS A TATTOO ON
THE BACK OF HIS HAND.

18:32.067 --> 18:35.070
DO YOU HAVE A PEN?
GET SOME PAPER.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.116
YEAH, CAN I HAVE
YOUR PEN AND PAPER?

18:38.639 --> 18:40.380
OK, HERE YOU GO.

18:50.999 --> 18:53.132
YOU DID GREAT, TARA.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.006
GARCIA, WE SENT YOU A PHOTO.

18:58.049 --> 19:00.748
IT'’S A SKETCH OF A TATTOO,
AND IT'’S ROUGH,

19:00.791 --> 19:03.359
SO WE'’RE GONNA NEED YOU
TO IDENTIFY EXACTLY WHAT IT IS,

19:03.403 --> 19:06.406
AND THEN RUN IT THROUGH
THE TATTOO RECOGNITION DATABASE.

19:06.449 --> 19:09.713
ALSO, CROSSCHECK IT
WITH CASES LUKE AND MATT
HAVE WORKED TOGETHER.

19:09.757 --> 19:12.760
RUNNING THE SKETCH AS IS.
I CAN'’T FIND ANY CASES

19:12.803 --> 19:15.545
SINCE MATT AND LUKE
HAVE JOINED THE BAU
WHERE IT POPS UP.

19:15.589 --> 19:17.895
I MEAN, ACTUALLY, THERE
ARE NO CASES OF THEM

19:17.939 --> 19:20.289
PUTTING AWAY ANY NEFARIOUS
PEOPLE THAT HAVE EVEN ESCAPED

19:20.333 --> 19:21.943
OR BEEN PAROLED
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

19:21.986 --> 19:24.380
LUKE USED TO WORK ON
THE FUGITIVE TASK FORCE.
MATT WAS IRT.

19:24.424 --> 19:25.990
WE SHOULD EXPAND
THE SEARCH TO BEFORE

19:26.034 --> 19:27.229
EITHER ONE OF THEM
JOINED THE BAU.

19:27.253 --> 19:29.124
OK, I AM O-N-I-T.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.691
I WILL GET BACK
TO YOU A-S-A-P.

19:30.734 --> 19:34.260
OK, WITH HRT'’s HELP,
WE HAVE A LOCKDOWN

19:34.303 --> 19:36.697
ON ALL THE ROADS
WITHIN A 4-MILE RADIUS

19:36.740 --> 19:38.177
OF THE ABDUCTION SITE.

19:38.220 --> 19:40.440
AND WE HAVE AN APB OUT
ON A BLACK VAN

19:40.483 --> 19:42.398
AND GUYS IN BLACK LEATHER
ON MOTORCYCLES.

19:42.442 --> 19:44.183
I'’M NOT SURE WHAT
THAT'’LL GET US.

19:44.226 --> 19:45.725
SINCE WE DIDN'’T
PICK THEM UP ON
ANY TRAFFIC CAMS,

19:45.749 --> 19:47.249
THEY MUST HAVE GONE
TO GROUND AS FAST
AS THEY COULD.

19:47.273 --> 19:48.946
WELL, I'’M READY TO GO
DOOR TO DOOR WITH MY TEAM.

19:48.970 --> 19:50.493
THANK YOU.

19:50.537 --> 19:52.217
RIGHT NOW THAT'’S
BASICALLY ALL WE'’VE GOT.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.153
BUT I'’M NOT SURE OUR GUYS
HAVE THAT KIND OF TIME.

20:00.808 --> 20:03.811
HEY! WHAT THE HELL?
GET YOUR ASSES IN GEAR.

20:05.900 --> 20:08.250
SOON AS WE BURN
THESE PIGS AND
MAKE THE DROP,

20:08.294 --> 20:09.469
WE'’RE GONE.

20:09.512 --> 20:10.600
LET'’S GO!

20:12.602 --> 20:14.474
FLEABAG.

20:16.127 --> 20:17.714
YOU LIKE GIVING ORDERS
WHEN I'’M NOT AROUND?

20:17.738 --> 20:18.913
THEY'’RE SLACKERS, BOSS.

20:18.956 --> 20:21.350
I DON'’T WANT TO
LET YOU DOWN.

20:28.270 --> 20:30.490
LOOK, I NEED TO MAKE SURE
EVERYTHING GOES SMOOTHLY

20:30.533 --> 20:31.491
FOR THE DELIVERY TONIGHT.

20:31.534 --> 20:34.363
IT WILL.

20:34.407 --> 20:35.886
HOW ARE OUR GUESTS DOING?

20:35.930 --> 20:38.062
THE ETORPHINE SHOULD
WEAR OFF SOON.

20:53.556 --> 20:55.950
MATT?

20:55.993 --> 20:57.256
MATT!

20:57.299 --> 21:01.390
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

21:01.434 --> 21:03.566
I'’M NOT SURE.

21:08.223 --> 21:09.311
WHERE'’S TARA?

21:09.355 --> 21:11.748
I DON'’T KNOW.

21:11.792 --> 21:13.228
NOT HERE.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.317
FBI TOUGH GUYS.

21:15.361 --> 21:19.103
IT'’S BEEN A LONG TIME.

21:19.147 --> 21:20.409
WHERE'’S DR. LEWIS?

21:20.453 --> 21:23.325
WE LEFT THAT BROAD BEHIND.

21:23.369 --> 21:24.892
THIS ISN'’T ABOUT HER.

21:29.984 --> 21:32.116
YEAH, YOU DON'’T
REMEMBER ME, DO YOU?

21:32.160 --> 21:35.685
MAYBE I'’VE CONFUSED YOU
WITH THE WHOLE HOMAGE
TO PHILLIP DOWD.

21:37.208 --> 21:38.645
YOU KNEW HIM?

21:38.688 --> 21:40.734
NO, I JUST KNEW
THAT IF I COPIED

21:40.777 --> 21:42.364
THE WORST KILLER
THIS TOWN'’S EVER SEEN THAT

21:42.388 --> 21:45.826
YOU GUYS... YOU GUYS
WOULD COME RUNNING,

21:45.869 --> 21:48.045
RIGHT, AS SOON AS
BODIES STARTED DROPPING.

21:48.089 --> 21:51.310
SO HERE WE ARE.

21:51.353 --> 21:54.530
YOU'’VE MADE A BIG
MISTAKE KIDNAPPING
FEDERAL AGENTS.

22:01.972 --> 22:04.714
HEY, YOU REMEMBER ME NOW?

22:06.890 --> 22:08.544
IT DOESN'’T RING A BELL.

22:08.588 --> 22:11.547
WE'’VE PUT AWAY A LOT
OF DIRT BAGS LIKE YOU.

22:22.515 --> 22:23.951
TAKE A GOOD LOOK
AT ME, MATT.

22:26.693 --> 22:28.259
IT'’S THE SCARS,
ISN'’T IT?

22:30.044 --> 22:32.089
MAYBE THEY'’RE
AN IMPROVEMENT.

22:39.880 --> 22:42.709
I GOT AN OLD CASE THAT
CONNECTS MATT AND LUKE.

22:42.752 --> 22:44.450
THE GUY'’S NAME IS
LOUIE CHAYCON,

22:44.493 --> 22:48.715
AND HE WAS THE GO-TO
ENFORCER FOR THE SARNICOLA
FAMILY IN CHICAGO.

22:48.758 --> 22:50.804
ACCORDING TO A FILE
THAT MATT WROTE ABOUT HIM,

22:50.847 --> 22:53.284
THE GUY IS DESCRIBED
AS "BRILLIANT, LETHAL,

22:53.328 --> 22:54.895
AND CRIMINALLY
SOPHISTICATED."

22:54.938 --> 22:56.940
HE LIKENED HIM TO
THE SERIAL KILLER
ISRAEL KEYES.

22:56.984 --> 22:58.289
I REMEMBER MATT
MENTIONING HIM.

22:58.333 --> 22:59.987
LIKE KEYES,
AFTER EACH HIT,

23:00.030 --> 23:02.052
HE'’D LEAVE AMERICA
UNTIL ANY HEAT ON HIM
COOLED DOWN.

23:02.076 --> 23:03.860
KEYES WOULD USUALLY HOP
ON A CRUISE BOAT,

23:03.904 --> 23:04.924
CHAYCON ALWAYS
WENT TO EUROPE.

23:04.948 --> 23:06.863
YEAH, MATT
FOLLOWED HIM THERE

23:06.907 --> 23:08.430
WHEN HE WAS
A MEMBER OF THE IRT.

23:08.474 --> 23:10.626
SOMEHOW THIS CHAYCON
DUDE GETS HIMSELF BACK
INTO THE STATES.

23:10.650 --> 23:13.043
THAT'’S WHEN OUR
VERY OWN LUKE ALVEZ
APPREHENDS HIM

23:13.087 --> 23:14.567
BACK IN 2012.

23:14.610 --> 23:16.438
HE WAS HIDING OUT
AT HIS BROTHER
BOBBY'’S HOUSE

23:16.482 --> 23:18.135
IN NETTLETON,
MISSISSIPPI

23:18.179 --> 23:19.354
WHEN LUKE FOUND HIM.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.225
YES, AND THEN HE WAS
SENTENCED TO 30 YEARS,

23:21.269 --> 23:23.073
AND HIS BROTHER BOBBY
WAS SENTENCED TO 10 YEARS

23:23.097 --> 23:24.968
FOR HARBORING
A DANGEROUS FUGITIVE.

23:25.012 --> 23:26.579
WELL, IF THIS CHAYCON
IS BEHIND BARS,

23:26.622 --> 23:28.319
HE CAN'’T BE OUR GUY.

23:28.363 --> 23:30.539
OH, THAT WOULD BE TRUE
IF CHAYCON WASN'’T EXTRADITED

23:30.583 --> 23:33.716
TO ITALY IN 2017,
WHERE HE ALSO FACED
MURDER CHARGES

23:33.760 --> 23:35.457
AND WHERE HE ESCAPED
CUSTODY.

23:35.501 --> 23:38.242
SO THERE IS
A CONNECTION BETWEEN
THIS GUY AND OUR BOYS.

23:38.286 --> 23:39.698
BUT THAT DOESN'’T
EXPLAIN WHY THIS GUY

23:39.722 --> 23:41.768
IS GOING TO ALL
THIS TROUBLE.

23:41.811 --> 23:43.572
YEAH, WE'’VE GOT
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HIS
PERSONAL GRUDGE IS WITH THEM.

23:43.596 --> 23:47.034
YEAH, NOT TO MENTION
HIS CONNECTION TO
THIS PARTICULAR CITY.

23:47.077 --> 23:48.949
I'’VE GOT MY CRIME SHOVEL.
I'’LL KEEP DIGGING.

23:48.992 --> 23:50.254
ANY LUCK
WITH THE TATTOO?

23:50.298 --> 23:52.605
SORT OF. I MANAGED TO
TEASE OUT THE SYMBOLS

23:52.648 --> 23:54.302
USING A HEALING ALGORITHM,

23:54.345 --> 23:55.932
AND I PUT THAT THROUGH
THE NATIONAL BIOMETRIC CENTER,

23:55.956 --> 23:57.479
BUT THERE'’S NOTHING.

23:57.523 --> 23:59.152
ACTUALLY, THERE'’S NOTHING
IN ANY CONVENTIONAL DATABASES.

23:59.176 --> 24:00.576
AND IT'’S A GOOD THING
FOR ALL OF US

24:00.613 --> 24:02.025
THAT I'’M FLUENT IN
UNCONVENTIONAL ONES,

24:02.049 --> 24:03.689
WHICH I'’M GONNA GO
LOOK AT NOW. GOOD-BYE.

24:31.644 --> 24:33.646
BOBBY.

24:37.911 --> 24:39.869
CHAYCON.

24:42.306 --> 24:44.091
UHH!

24:45.788 --> 24:47.050
SON OF A BITCH.

24:48.748 --> 24:50.924
YOU TWO ARE GONNA PAY
FOR WHAT YOU DID TO MY BROTHER.

24:50.967 --> 24:53.230
WHAT WE DID
TO BOBBY?

24:53.274 --> 24:55.668
YOU DON'’T SAY HIS NAME. EVER.

24:57.278 --> 24:58.627
HE'’S DEAD BECAUSE OF YOU.

24:58.671 --> 25:01.369
THEY BEAT HIM TO DEATH
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

25:03.414 --> 25:05.436
AND THEN THEY MADE SURE
MY FACE WOULD BE A REMINDER...

25:05.460 --> 25:07.462
FOR THE REST OF
MY LIFE.

25:07.506 --> 25:10.509
NAH, THAT'’S ALL
ON YOU, LOUIE.

25:10.552 --> 25:12.989
YOU CAN'’T BE A HITMAN
FOR THE CHICAGO MOB

25:13.033 --> 25:15.098
AND NOT KNOW THAT YOU
AND YOUR FAMILY ARE
GONNA BE MARKED.

25:15.122 --> 25:18.952
NO, YOU AND YOU
ALLOWED THEM

25:18.995 --> 25:21.345
TO PUT ME AND BOBBY
IN GENERAL POPULATION

25:21.389 --> 25:23.304
WITH LOS REYES,

25:23.347 --> 25:26.829
BECAUSE YOU KNEW EXACTLY
WHAT THEY WERE GONNA DO TO US.

25:26.873 --> 25:28.004
PRISON'’S
A DANGEROUS PLACE.

25:28.048 --> 25:30.093
AHH!

25:30.137 --> 25:32.966
I WILL WATCH BOTH OF YOU...

25:33.009 --> 25:36.317
SUFFER AND DIE...

25:36.360 --> 25:38.493
JUST LIKE MY BROTHER.

25:45.413 --> 25:46.762
GO AHEAD, PENELOPE.

25:46.806 --> 25:48.808
OK, I JUST SENT YOU
SOME MORE INTEL I FOUND

25:48.851 --> 25:51.854
ABOUT CHAYCON'’S PRISON
RECORD BEFORE HE WAS
EXTRADITED TO ITALY.

25:51.898 --> 25:53.856
IT TURNS OUT THAT HE
AND HIS BROTHER BOBBY

25:53.900 --> 25:56.293
WERE ON THE VERY WRONG
SIDE OF A GANG FIGHT

25:56.337 --> 25:57.532
WHILE THEY WERE
STILL IN PRISON.

25:57.556 --> 25:58.663
HIS BROTHER BOBBY WAS
BEATEN TO DEATH

25:58.687 --> 26:00.297
RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM.

26:00.341 --> 26:02.909
WAIT A MINUTE.
LOS REYES CUT OUT
THE GUY'’S TONGUE.

26:02.952 --> 26:04.606
THAT'’S DEFINITELY
A STATEMENT.

26:04.650 --> 26:06.758
THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT
HE WAS COOPERATING
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT.

26:06.782 --> 26:09.742
IF THAT'’S THE CASE,
CHAYCON PROBABLY
BLAMES MATT AND LUKE

26:09.785 --> 26:11.178
FOR HIS BROTHER'’S
DEATH.

26:11.221 --> 26:12.634
WE COULD BE DEALING
WITH A CLASSIC CASE

26:12.658 --> 26:14.442
OR AGGRESSION
TRANSFERENCE.

26:14.485 --> 26:18.185
CHAYCON WILL WANT TO DO
TO THEM WHAT THE GANG DID
TO HIS BROTHER.

26:22.624 --> 26:23.799
SORRY, I DID
WHAT I COULD.

26:23.843 --> 26:25.540
THEY'’RE NOT
BACKING DOWN.

26:25.584 --> 26:28.325
IS THERE
A PROBLEM?

26:30.197 --> 26:31.720
THE BANDITS WANT TO
CHANGE THE LOCATION

26:31.764 --> 26:33.635
AND TIME FOR THE BUY.

26:33.679 --> 26:34.984
WHAT? WHY?

26:35.028 --> 26:36.483
THEY SAY IT WAS ONE
THING WHEN EVERYONE

26:36.507 --> 26:38.466
WAS RUNNING AROUND
HIDING FROM A SNIPER,

26:38.509 --> 26:40.120
BUT NOW YOU GOT
THE FEDS AND THE COPS.

26:40.163 --> 26:41.619
THEY'’RE ALL OVER
THE PLACE LOOKING
FOR THOSE TWO.

26:41.643 --> 26:44.777
OK, LOOK, YOU TELL THEM
THAT IF THEY SCREW US,

26:44.820 --> 26:47.214
WE KNOW HOW TO PUT THEM
OUT OF BUSINESS PERMANENTLY.

26:47.257 --> 26:48.737
WILL DO, BOSS.

26:48.781 --> 26:50.957
YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'’LL TELL THEM.

26:59.879 --> 27:02.272
SOMETHING IMPORTANT
IS GOING DOWN TONIGHT,

27:02.316 --> 27:04.666
AND THEY'’RE NOT GONNA
KEEP US AROUND
FOR THE MAIN EVENT.

27:04.710 --> 27:06.799
LISTEN, TAKING US
IS ONLY PERSONAL
FOR CHAYCON.

27:06.842 --> 27:08.757
THE OTHER GUYS GOT
NO SKIN THE GAME.

27:08.801 --> 27:10.846
SO WE CAN DRIVE
A WEDGE BETWEEN THEM.

27:10.890 --> 27:12.674
ALL RIGHT, I HAVE AN IDEA.

27:12.718 --> 27:14.415
OH, WHAT'’S THAT?

27:14.458 --> 27:15.895
I'’M GONNA TELL THEM
THAT IT WAS ME

27:15.938 --> 27:17.766
THAT TOLD THE WARDEN
TO PUT THEM IN GEN POP.

27:17.810 --> 27:19.610
NO, THAT'’S NOT GONNA
MAKE A DIFFERENCE, LUKE.

27:19.638 --> 27:20.813
LET'’S...

27:20.856 --> 27:23.337
IT'’LL FOCUS HIS
ATTENTION ON ME, OK?

27:23.380 --> 27:25.469
THE GUYS WILL HAVE TO
TAKE THEIR ATTENTION

27:25.513 --> 27:27.210
OFF OF WHAT THEY'’RE
INTERESTED IN.

27:27.254 --> 27:29.343
NOW, WHERE WERE WE?

27:29.386 --> 27:30.997
OH, WE'’RE STANDING NOW?

27:31.040 --> 27:32.694
YOU WANT TO KNOW
THE TRUTH, LOUIE?

27:32.738 --> 27:34.174
LUKE, STOP IT.

27:34.217 --> 27:36.350
YOU TWO. YOU'’RE
LIKE BROTHERS.

27:36.393 --> 27:40.049
YEAH, I WISH I COULD
SAY THE SAME ABOUT YOU
AND YOUR OWN BROTHER.

27:40.093 --> 27:42.530
YOU'’RE TALKING
CRAP ABOUT MY BROTHER.

27:42.573 --> 27:45.446
IT WASN'’T GEN POP
THAT GOT BOBBY KILLED.

27:47.753 --> 27:50.320
YOUR BROTHER'’S DEAD
BECAUSE HE WAS
TALKING TO ME.

27:50.364 --> 27:53.715
BOBBY COULDN'’T STAND
SPENDING ONE MORE DAY
IN PRISON,

27:53.759 --> 27:56.805
SO HE REACHED OUT TO ME,

27:56.849 --> 28:00.200
AND HE SAID THAT HE'’D
TELL ME EVERYTHING

28:00.243 --> 28:02.811
HE KNEW ABOUT YOU
AND YOUR WORK,

28:02.855 --> 28:04.726
THE SARNICOLA FAMILY,
EVERYTHING...

28:04.770 --> 28:06.336
THE DRUGS, THE HITS.

28:06.380 --> 28:08.382
SOMEBODY FOUND OUT.

28:08.425 --> 28:10.297
THEY RATTED HIM OUT.

28:10.340 --> 28:13.256
SOMEBODY FROM INSIDE
YOUR CREW, LOUIE.

28:13.300 --> 28:14.605
THAT'’S BULL.

28:14.649 --> 28:15.824
I DIDN'’T KNOW HIS NAME.

28:15.868 --> 28:18.087
BUT BOBBY WAS REAL WORRIED

28:18.131 --> 28:22.004
ABOUT SOMEBODY
THEY CALLED FLEA.

28:22.048 --> 28:23.702
WHAT?

28:23.745 --> 28:26.966
OH, THAT STRUCK
A NERVE.

28:27.009 --> 28:29.577
HEY, SHUT UP.

28:29.620 --> 28:31.535
THEY'’RE LYING.

28:31.579 --> 28:33.320
THEY'’LL SAY ANYTHING
TO SAVE THEIR ASSES.

28:33.363 --> 28:36.715
DON'’T YOU EVER WONDER
WHY YOU ONLY TOOK A BEATING

28:36.758 --> 28:39.979
AND BOBBY WAS KILLED?

28:40.022 --> 28:42.285
YOU KNOW WE'’D HAVE
TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE
A RIVAL GANG

28:42.329 --> 28:44.089
SO YOU WOULDN'’T
SUSPECT ONE OF
YOUR OWN GUYS.

28:44.113 --> 28:46.289
COME ON, BOSS.
YOU KNOW ME.

28:46.333 --> 28:47.726
I WOULD NEVER
HURT BOBBY.

28:47.769 --> 28:52.078
YOU HEAR THAT?
"I WOULD NEVER
HURT BOBBY."

28:52.121 --> 28:54.384
THAT'’S WHAT WE CALL
A PROTEST.

28:54.428 --> 28:56.909
THAT'’S A NON-DENIAL
DENIAL.

28:56.952 --> 28:59.346
LIARS PROTEST.

28:59.389 --> 29:04.264
INNOCENT PEOPLE
FORCEFULLY DENY
TILL THE END.

29:07.267 --> 29:10.574
IF I'’M LYING, FLEABAG,

29:10.618 --> 29:12.838
HOW DO I KNOW YOUR NAME?

29:12.881 --> 29:15.231
YEAH, FLEABAG,

29:15.275 --> 29:16.406
HOW DO THEY KNOW
YOUR NAME?

29:16.450 --> 29:17.886
I DON'’T KNOW, BOSS.

29:17.930 --> 29:21.281
YOU KNOW, HE MUST HAVE
HEARD SOMEONE SAY IT.

29:22.848 --> 29:24.284
YEAH.

29:24.327 --> 29:25.415
YEAH. I MEAN, COME ON.

29:25.459 --> 29:26.982
CAN'’T TRUST A FED, RIGHT?

29:27.026 --> 29:29.637
FLEA, GO GET CARSON.

29:29.680 --> 29:31.682
COME ON. COME ON.

29:44.913 --> 29:49.222
OH, DARK WEB, THANK YOU
FOR HELPING ME SEE THE LIGHT.

29:49.265 --> 29:50.397
GO AHEAD, GARCIA.

29:50.440 --> 29:53.139
EMILY, MY SWEET,
I HAVE A CONFIRMATION

29:53.182 --> 29:55.750
FROM A TATTOO ARTIST
IN CHI-TOWN

29:55.794 --> 29:57.423
THAT THAT TATTOO WAS
SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED

29:57.447 --> 29:59.972
FOR A BIKER GROUP THAT
IS LOOSELY ASSOCIATED

30:00.015 --> 30:03.671
WITH AN OUTLAW BIKER CLUB
KNOWN AS THE ROLLING DEVILS.

30:03.714 --> 30:05.455
THE DEVILS OPERATE
THROUGHOUT

30:05.499 --> 30:07.457
THE MIDWESTERN
UNITED STATES.

30:07.501 --> 30:08.608
GARCIA, WITHIN
OUR SEARCH AREA,

30:08.632 --> 30:09.914
DO YOU KNOW OF ANY
SPECIFIC LOCATION

30:09.938 --> 30:11.722
CONTROLLED BY
THE ROLLING DEVILS?

30:11.766 --> 30:13.768
NO, BUT WE'’RE NOT LOOKING
FOR THE DEVILS

30:13.812 --> 30:15.335
AS IN THE OUTLAW
BIKER GROUP.

30:15.378 --> 30:16.989
WE ARE LOOKING FOR
A GROUP OF BIKERS

30:17.032 --> 30:18.618
THAT BROKE OFF WITH THEM
BECAUSE THEY WERE INTERESTED

30:18.642 --> 30:21.341
IN DEVILIER BEHAVIOR,
LIKE SLINGING DRUGS

30:21.384 --> 30:22.995
AS OPPOSED TO EASY RIDING.

30:23.038 --> 30:24.561
THANK YOU.

30:24.605 --> 30:27.086
I KNOW A GUY IN
THE GANG TASK FORCE.

30:27.129 --> 30:29.262
HE'’S GOT PEOPLE EMBEDDED
IN THAT WORLD.

30:29.305 --> 30:31.438
LET ME SEE IF HE
CAN GIVE ME SOMETHING.

30:33.005 --> 30:34.876
YOU WANTED TO
SEE ME, BOSS?

30:34.920 --> 30:37.574
YEAH. UH...

30:37.618 --> 30:41.665
CARSON, LISTEN
VERY CAREFULLY.

30:44.494 --> 30:45.887
DAMN.

30:45.931 --> 30:46.845
I'’M GONNA NEED YOU
TO START TAKING ON

30:46.888 --> 30:48.585
MORE RESPONSIBILITY
AROUND HERE.

30:48.629 --> 30:49.673
NO PROBLEM.

30:49.717 --> 30:52.851
STARTING WITH
TAKING OUT THE TRASH.

30:52.894 --> 30:54.263
OH, AND WHEN YOU'’RE
DONE WITH THAT,

30:54.287 --> 30:56.332
SEND CYRUS AND
GUNNER IN HERE TO
HELP ME CLEAN UP.

30:56.376 --> 30:58.639
WILL DO, BOSS.

31:13.306 --> 31:15.699
MY CONTACT WITH
THE GANG TASK FORCE
WAS RIGHT.

31:15.743 --> 31:18.702
IT LOOKS LIKE SOME LOCAL
BIKE ENTHUSIASTS HANG OUT HERE.

31:18.746 --> 31:20.966
CHIEF, YOU AND I WILL
TAKE THE FRONT.

31:21.009 --> 31:23.577
ROSSI AND YOUR GUY
CAN COVER THE BACK.

31:23.620 --> 31:24.946
RANGLIN, COVER
THE BACK WITH ROSSI.

31:24.970 --> 31:26.623
YES, SIR.

31:32.891 --> 31:35.806
♪ I THINK I MET YOU BEFORE

31:35.850 --> 31:38.026
♪ I THINK YOU ANSWERED
THE DOOR ♪

31:38.070 --> 31:39.288
HEY!

31:39.332 --> 31:40.942
LISTEN UP.

31:40.986 --> 31:42.901
WE NEED SOME
INFORMATION AND
WE NEED IT FAST.

31:42.944 --> 31:44.946
SO WE WILL BE ASKING
YOU SOME QUESTIONS,

31:44.990 --> 31:47.514
AND WE ARE LOOKING
FOR YOUR COOPERATION.

31:47.557 --> 31:49.777
EVERYBODY KEEP YOUR HANDS
WHERE WE CAN SEE THEM.

32:00.527 --> 32:03.965
LOOK, I DON'’T MEAN TO
COMPROMISE ANY OP
YOU'’VE GOT GOING HERE.

32:04.009 --> 32:05.987
BUT I'’VE GOT TWO
MEMBERS OF MY TEAM
THAT ARE BEING HELD

32:06.011 --> 32:07.969
BY A GROUP OF
ROLLING DEVILS.

32:08.013 --> 32:10.580
THE ROLLING DEVILS AREN'’T
ALLOWED ANYWHERE NEAR HERE.

32:10.624 --> 32:12.452
THIS IS STRICTLY
RIGHTEOUS BANDITS TERRITORY.

32:12.495 --> 32:16.108
I GET IT.
BUT YOU HEAR THINGS.

32:17.892 --> 32:19.981
I'’D LIKE TO HELP.

32:20.025 --> 32:22.723
BUT I'’VE BEEN
UNDERCOVER FOR 3 YEARS.

32:22.766 --> 32:24.333
AND I'’M GETTING CLOSE
TO TAKING DOWN

32:24.377 --> 32:26.901
THE LARGEST OPIATE
DISTRIBUTION NETWORK
IN THE MIDWEST,

32:26.945 --> 32:28.337
AND I CAN'’T HELP YOU.

32:28.381 --> 32:30.774
LISTEN TO ME, LUCA.
I'’VE GOT TWO AGENTS

32:30.818 --> 32:33.255
THAT ARE LIKE MY SONS,
AND THEY'’RE IN TROUBLE.

32:33.299 --> 32:35.214
YOU UNDERSTAND?

32:35.257 --> 32:36.824
I CAN'’T.

32:36.867 --> 32:39.479
YOU GIVE ME SOMETHING
OR I SWEAR I WILL

32:39.522 --> 32:42.395
WALK OUT THAT DOOR
RIGHT NOW AND
BLOW YOUR COVER.

32:45.006 --> 32:46.965
WAIT.

32:47.008 --> 32:48.836
WAIT.

32:51.317 --> 32:53.449
I'’VE HEARD THEY'RE USING
AN ABANDONED WAREHOUSE

32:53.493 --> 32:55.364
AS THEIR STASH HOUSE.

32:55.408 --> 32:57.627
IT'’S SOMEWHERE IN
THE SOUTHEAST DISTRICT.

32:57.671 --> 33:00.239
I DON'’T HAVE THE ADDRESS.

33:00.282 --> 33:01.849
YOU DID THE RIGHT
THING, LUCA.

33:01.892 --> 33:04.025
HEY, I STILL NEED TO
GO BACK OUT THERE,

33:04.069 --> 33:06.593
SO MAKE IT LOOK GOOD.

33:06.636 --> 33:08.595
RIGHT.

33:08.638 --> 33:10.118
WHERE DO YOU WANT IT?

33:10.162 --> 33:12.251
THIS SIDE.

33:16.124 --> 33:18.213
THIS LOSER DOESN'’T
KNOW A DAMN THING.

33:18.257 --> 33:19.606
LET'’S GET OUT OF HERE.

33:35.709 --> 33:39.408
HE'’S COMING.

33:39.452 --> 33:41.019
LUKE...

33:44.152 --> 33:45.390
IS THERE ANYTHING YOU
WANT ME TO TELL YOUR GIRL

33:45.414 --> 33:46.763
WHEN I SEE HER?

33:46.807 --> 33:48.678
BASTARD.

33:51.855 --> 33:53.292
I'’LL BE SURE
TO PASS THAT ON.

33:55.816 --> 33:59.994
AND YOU...

34:00.038 --> 34:01.387
MATT.

34:01.430 --> 34:03.693
ANYTHING FOR THE WIFE?

34:06.522 --> 34:10.570
I SWEAR TO GOD, LOUIE.

34:10.613 --> 34:12.093
HEY, GUYS, COME ON.

34:12.137 --> 34:14.356
LOOK, I PROMISE

34:14.400 --> 34:17.533
I WILL TAKE AS MUCH
CARE WITH THEM

34:17.577 --> 34:20.667
AS MY BOYS ARE ABOUT
TO TAKE WITH YOU.

34:29.023 --> 34:31.199
COMMANDER RUSH'’S
PEOPLE HAVE SECURED
THE PERIMETER.

34:31.243 --> 34:32.635
NOW WE JUST NEED
TO FIND THEM.

34:32.679 --> 34:35.116
GARCIA, WE NEED YOU TO
SEARCH THE CCTV FOOTAGE

34:35.160 --> 34:37.031
FOR MEN ON MOTORCYCLES
COMING AND GOING

34:37.075 --> 34:39.381
FROM A WAREHOUSE OVER
THE PAST FEW DAYS.

34:41.035 --> 34:43.124
OK, I'’VE GOT A FORECLOSED
WAREHOUSE COMPLEX

34:50.958 --> 34:52.525
LET'’S HOPE WE'RE
NOT TOO LATE.

34:58.008 --> 34:59.836
ALL RIGHT, LET'’S GET
RID OF THESE TWO.

34:59.880 --> 35:01.186
YOU GOT IT, BOSS.

39:17.180 --> 39:19.835
