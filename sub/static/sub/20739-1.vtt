WEBVTT

02:58.695 --> 03:00.905
First time I saw this country,

03:00.989 --> 03:04.450
it had buffalo grass and blue-joint
up to the stirrups.

03:05.035 --> 03:08.579
By the second year
we had 8,000 Texas half-bred cattle,

03:09.206 --> 03:14.043
and over 3,500 volumes
of English literature in my library.

03:15.921 --> 03:18.339
Hell, we just cut out the unbranded stock

03:18.382 --> 03:21.592
and divided them up even handed
between the outfits.

03:21.677 --> 03:24.720
There was no arguing over mavericks
like today.

03:25.848 --> 03:27.849
You've got it good today.

03:28.392 --> 03:30.143
Two percent annual loss then.

03:31.061 --> 03:34.188
Now it's seven percent from rustling alone,
not to mention winter kill,

03:34.231 --> 03:37.024
calving loss, miring down in the spring.

03:44.992 --> 03:46.659
How many are you?

03:50.038 --> 03:53.875
Mr. Braxton, did you notice how these guys
sew their old boot tops on the saddle

03:53.917 --> 03:55.585
to hold ammunition?

03:55.627 --> 03:58.921
Pete, don't pester him
if he doesn't want to be pestered.

03:59.006 --> 04:02.800
Well, it'd just be awful nice
to know the whole story.

04:03.927 --> 04:07.513
Well, it's beautiful country.

04:09.433 --> 04:11.434
Yes, sir. It sure is.

04:14.146 --> 04:16.397
You especially feel that now?

04:20.611 --> 04:21.944
Yeah.

05:19.711 --> 05:24.048
I sure hope them sporting ladies
don't get sunburned.

05:25.175 --> 05:27.552
I like them white as a pastry.

05:29.221 --> 05:30.346
Ladies.

05:44.361 --> 05:46.028
Are you all set here?

05:46.780 --> 05:48.197
All set, Pete.

06:02.546 --> 06:05.548
Shall we start the horse or will you?

06:07.384 --> 06:08.843
I will, sir.

06:42.252 --> 06:45.379
-Goodbye, Tom.
-Well, that's one of them.

06:49.009 --> 06:51.010
His name was Sandy Chase

06:51.094 --> 06:54.221
and he came here from Rhode Island
with the Army.

06:54.264 --> 06:56.098
He was 24 years old.

06:59.561 --> 07:00.978
We lost Seven percent of our stock

07:01.063 --> 07:04.815
between spring roundup and shipment
in the fall last year to rustlers.

07:05.484 --> 07:07.401
You always mention the percentage.

07:07.736 --> 07:09.528
I wonder why you do that.

07:09.613 --> 07:12.782
This is my fourth frontier
and I know how they run.

07:12.824 --> 07:15.785
I was in the California gold fields
before I was 18.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.411
I was at the rush at Golden Gulch

07:17.454 --> 07:19.955
and I went with the Grazing Committee
to South America.

07:19.998 --> 07:23.876
These long ropers in the Missouri Breaks
are a mixed bag.

07:23.960 --> 07:26.587
Barbers from Minneapolis,

07:26.630 --> 07:29.548
failed grangers, Scandinavian half-breeds,

07:30.384 --> 07:33.761
wolfers and woodcutters,
dishonest apprentices,

07:34.763 --> 07:36.555
raftsmen, poisoners.

07:36.807 --> 07:39.975
You give them a chance
and they'll waste everything.

07:46.316 --> 07:50.820
You're astonished at my arrogance.
At not even having a trial, aren't you?

07:52.781 --> 07:54.824
Then why don't you get over it?

07:54.866 --> 07:58.077
Our situation has become
nearly as bad as it could be.

07:59.830 --> 08:04.125
Honey, pull down <i>Tristam Shandy</i>
again for me, would you?

08:19.725 --> 08:20.891
Daddy.

08:26.356 --> 08:27.690
Excuse me.

09:16.406 --> 09:17.948
Get that gate.

09:22.120 --> 09:23.412
Come on.

09:33.089 --> 09:34.882
How did she go, Tom?

09:36.885 --> 09:39.220
Everybody else been back a day.

09:39.471 --> 09:42.681
Brought in about 14 head
of the first-class order.

09:43.934 --> 09:45.059
Yeah.

09:51.441 --> 09:54.527
-How was Wyoming?
-It was fine.

09:55.737 --> 09:57.738
Spent a couple of days in K.C.

09:57.781 --> 10:00.866
trying to keep from associating
with criminals.

10:01.952 --> 10:05.996
Why, they hit the Union Pacific
down there so many times

10:06.081 --> 10:09.542
the place has begun to look like
a lawmen's convention.

10:09.960 --> 10:12.253
They got two Pinkertons in K.C.

10:12.295 --> 10:16.465
and I do believe that one of them
was the legendary Charlie Siringo.

10:18.301 --> 10:20.803
Did he claim to be a border cowboy?

10:21.680 --> 10:23.305
I can't remember.

10:23.598 --> 10:26.642
-Said he could talk Mexican.
-Yeah, that's him.

10:28.520 --> 10:30.521
How'd you know it was a detective?

10:31.314 --> 10:33.607
Rancher's wife
wanting to go to bed with him.

10:33.650 --> 10:35.651
He kept giving her a no.

10:36.278 --> 10:38.654
Damned if I can understand that.

10:38.864 --> 10:40.990
Well, I took care of her, Cal.

10:41.074 --> 10:43.701
-You did that, huh?
-You're damn sure.

10:43.785 --> 10:46.620
-Had a good time, too, thank you.
-Did you?

10:47.497 --> 10:49.582
Spent the night in Martinsdale.

10:49.666 --> 10:52.418
Couldn't get no credit at the whorehouse,

10:52.502 --> 10:56.755
so I picked up this chubby little girl
off some sodbuster's outfit.

10:56.840 --> 10:59.341
Yeah. How was she?

11:03.513 --> 11:05.014
About like a Swiss clock.

11:05.098 --> 11:07.600
Same exact movement
over and over again.

11:10.020 --> 11:11.186
Yeah.

11:29.706 --> 11:32.249
-It was Sandy, huh?
-Yeah.

11:33.877 --> 11:35.044
Yeah.

11:36.963 --> 11:39.590
Sandy's gone. He's dead.

11:39.925 --> 11:43.552
David Braxton's foreman,
what's his name, Cary?

11:44.387 --> 11:45.679
Pete Marker.

11:45.722 --> 11:48.933
Pete Marker caught him,
and they hung him.

11:50.894 --> 11:52.353
Damn it!

11:53.521 --> 11:56.565
I knew somebody's bunch
wasn't in that corral.

11:58.401 --> 12:01.737
Little Tod was in town.
Everybody was at the hanging.

12:07.744 --> 12:10.245
-How'd Sandy go out?
-Pretty good.

12:10.288 --> 12:12.039
Pretty good. Yeah.

12:12.832 --> 12:16.543
They hung him up on a cottonwood though,
and he sort of...

12:18.672 --> 12:20.005
He sort of what?

12:22.509 --> 12:24.718
Sort of strangled for a while.

12:26.554 --> 12:30.516
Braxton was there dressed in a suit
looking like God.

12:36.356 --> 12:37.606
God damn!

12:38.233 --> 12:41.402
Boy, I'll tell you,
the first time I met Sandy...

12:41.444 --> 12:43.445
Now, listen to this, now.

12:43.822 --> 12:47.366
First time I met Sandy
he was rustling on his own.

12:47.450 --> 12:51.286
He had a stolen cavalry pony
and he kept this dog.

12:52.205 --> 12:53.622
As soon as he'd kill the steer,

12:53.665 --> 12:56.500
why he'd cut the brand off
and feed it to the dog.

12:56.584 --> 12:59.044
He said before they'd get
enough evidence to convict him,

12:59.129 --> 13:02.256
they'd have to lock that dog up,
and pick through his shit for a week,

13:02.298 --> 13:04.800
before they can find the brand.

13:15.311 --> 13:18.647
My aunt ran a laundry in St. Paul.

13:20.442 --> 13:23.944
Got strangled by a Chinaman
while she was washing her dog.

13:23.987 --> 13:26.613
It's easy to die. Easy.

13:29.284 --> 13:31.326
Well, they sure killed Sandy.

13:31.369 --> 13:33.245
He was the only comedian in this outfit.

13:33.329 --> 13:35.748
-Well, you can't...
-Every outfit ought to have a comedian.

13:35.832 --> 13:38.709
You can't run that many rustled horses
across open ground.

13:38.793 --> 13:42.046
Now, I know I've been saying that
but you can't, is all.

13:42.130 --> 13:43.964
What are we supposed to do, Tom?

13:44.007 --> 13:47.634
Open up a stand and sell stolen horses
over the counter?

13:47.677 --> 13:51.472
No, we gotta get a relay ranch
halfway across,

13:51.514 --> 13:54.141
so as we got somewheres
where we can relay them at.

13:54.184 --> 13:56.018
-That's right.
-Well, that's just...

13:56.061 --> 13:58.604
That's just really fucking great.

13:58.688 --> 14:00.689
Only we ain't got a ranch.

14:00.732 --> 14:04.568
We ain't got no money!
The only horses we got are out there!

14:04.652 --> 14:06.820
We can't move the bastards
across the Breaks

14:06.863 --> 14:08.113
without everybody knowing.

14:08.198 --> 14:11.116
Let's just stick up the N.P. Railroad
and buy a ranch.

14:11.201 --> 14:13.160
Hell, let's rob a bank.

14:13.203 --> 14:15.704
I mean, if we're gonna get hung
for rustling horses,

14:15.747 --> 14:17.164
we ought to be robbing trains.

14:17.207 --> 14:20.375
Why don't you boys just move on down
with that hole-in-the-wall bunch

14:20.418 --> 14:23.045
and you'll be around people
that think like that.

14:29.636 --> 14:33.180
Boy, a couple of years ago
they'd have put Sandy

14:33.223 --> 14:36.475
in Red Lodge Penitentiary weaving bridles.

14:39.562 --> 14:42.481
Seem like there's something new in the air.

14:47.946 --> 14:52.407
I'll bet you Marker'll bait crows with Sandy
for a week before he'll cut him down.

14:52.450 --> 14:56.453
I worked for that son of a bitch once
on the reservation roundup.

14:56.579 --> 14:59.164
And he will leave Sandy in the trees.

15:00.792 --> 15:05.087
Hell, when we was fighting in Kansas,
we had relays all over the damn place.

15:06.005 --> 15:08.215
We relayed a cousin of mine

15:08.800 --> 15:12.511
all the way from Medicine Tree
to the hot springs in New Mexico.

15:12.595 --> 15:14.471
He beat the telegraph.

15:14.556 --> 15:16.431
It took the detectives two years

15:16.516 --> 15:19.143
to cover the same ground
he covered in a week.

15:19.227 --> 15:22.646
And when they got there
he was in his grave up on the Chama.

15:23.648 --> 15:26.984
Why was you having to move
this cousin around so much?

15:28.611 --> 15:30.237
He did card tricks.

15:31.447 --> 15:32.865
I get it.

15:36.411 --> 15:38.912
So he done a card trick for this nigger
up on the Chama

15:38.955 --> 15:40.664
and the nigger throttled him.

15:41.958 --> 15:43.167
I see.

15:46.254 --> 15:47.504
Say, Cal?

15:48.798 --> 15:52.426
Why don't we put that relay
in Braxton's backyard?

15:55.346 --> 15:56.471
Yeah.

15:59.475 --> 16:02.978
It sure beats sending three or four horses
at a time out into Kansas.

16:03.062 --> 16:05.564
The law there is pretty effective now.

16:09.903 --> 16:13.655
I get a kick out of Little Tod.
He says we ought to rob a train.

16:20.246 --> 16:21.371
No...

16:23.249 --> 16:24.833
I'm tired, Cal.

16:27.170 --> 16:30.964
I'm gonna turn in.
Tomorrow we have a nice day.

16:38.014 --> 16:39.806
Too bad about Sandy.

18:01.431 --> 18:04.766
All right, move over there! Move, move!

18:04.809 --> 18:07.436
All right, I want you to uncouple that car.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.479
-Hurry up!
-I can't do it.

18:10.064 --> 18:11.940
I'm not sure I'm able to do it.

18:12.025 --> 18:14.192
Just get down there and pull the pin out!
Go on!

18:14.277 --> 18:17.029
-I'm a clerk, I'm not mechanically inclined.
-Hurry up!

18:46.976 --> 18:48.518
Okay, get the money out.

18:48.936 --> 18:51.146
-What's your name?
-Nelson.

18:51.230 --> 18:52.481
Nelson, you're doing all right.

18:52.523 --> 18:57.319
You do this right, you can say you seen
Jesse James and lived to tell the story.

18:58.196 --> 18:59.529
You're not Jesse James.

19:01.032 --> 19:04.326
You ain't Charlie Siringo.
Just give me the money, Nelson.

19:04.410 --> 19:08.205
-I'm not permitted to touch this.
-Give me the God damn money.

19:28.851 --> 19:30.852
Don't start blaming me.

19:30.937 --> 19:32.687
I am blaming you!

19:32.772 --> 19:35.482
This is it on trains! This is it!

19:35.817 --> 19:37.150
God Almighty!

19:37.193 --> 19:38.735
This is it!

19:38.820 --> 19:40.362
No more trains, Tod!

19:40.446 --> 19:42.155
I just don't wanna get blamed!

19:49.705 --> 19:50.997
We got it!

19:52.875 --> 19:54.793
You need some help?

19:54.877 --> 19:57.379
Just pick up the money, God damn it.

20:03.052 --> 20:06.388
But they're all ones! Tom, they're all ones!

20:08.182 --> 20:10.058
Where am I gonna put them all?

20:10.101 --> 20:12.769
I don't want to hear that now, just...

20:15.648 --> 20:17.065
God, isn't this just terrible?

20:17.150 --> 20:20.652
Yeah, and the next time you mention trains
it's gonna get worse!

20:24.824 --> 20:26.658
You boys new at this?

20:30.746 --> 20:33.081
Appreciate your concern, Nelson.

20:43.426 --> 20:45.802
Look, there's tens in the water.
Get in there, Tod.

20:45.887 --> 20:48.013
Get in the water! Get those tens!

20:57.064 --> 20:58.398
One more time.

21:02.737 --> 21:04.362
Get out of my way!

21:07.950 --> 21:11.077
Come on now, let's get out of here
with what we've got.

21:33.267 --> 21:35.101
Morning, my little darling.

21:35.144 --> 21:38.730
Easy, Si, or you'll see them in church.

21:43.819 --> 21:46.696
I think all of you working men and women

21:46.781 --> 21:50.033
have had time now
to consider this case before us.

21:50.117 --> 21:51.243
There's Braxton.

21:51.327 --> 21:53.286
And I have reviewed its details

21:53.329 --> 21:57.040
and now I feel secure enough
to pronounce sentence.

21:57.124 --> 22:00.669
Subject, of course,
to your scrutiny and support.

22:00.711 --> 22:03.129
Make him confess first.
We wanna hear him confess.

22:03.172 --> 22:06.424
I think the kindest thing we can do
to this bird

22:06.509 --> 22:09.511
is to send him up to the territorial prison.

22:09.554 --> 22:12.889
He's been about as cooperative
as any prisoner we've tried around here.

22:12.974 --> 22:14.307
Cecil's always cooperative.

22:14.350 --> 22:16.726
And I see no direct cause to hang him.

22:17.395 --> 22:18.687
Don't he look like God?

22:18.771 --> 22:22.357
Now, who's got an opinion about how
long you might think of sending him up?

22:22.400 --> 22:25.569
-I think it's clearly indicated.
-He'll take anything.

22:25.653 --> 22:29.155
-How would 10 to 20 sound to you?
-Sounds about right to me.

22:29.991 --> 22:33.493
-How soon would I be eligible for parole?
-In about two weeks.

22:33.536 --> 22:34.869
Two weeks!

22:37.498 --> 22:39.541
Anything further
you'd like to say to the Court

22:39.584 --> 22:41.710
before we send you to your just deserts?

22:41.752 --> 22:43.545
And if I may speak for the Court,

22:44.255 --> 22:47.173
we would prefer
that it be something colorful.

22:47.216 --> 22:49.676
Life on the frontier being what it is.

22:51.178 --> 22:52.596
Just that...

22:55.433 --> 22:57.684
It may seem to you boys

22:57.727 --> 23:00.270
like a hard way to make the papers.

23:01.314 --> 23:03.189
But I'm not ashamed of robbing that train,

23:05.067 --> 23:08.153
of blowing bridges, sticking up banks,

23:08.904 --> 23:11.573
or for my careless, devil-may-care gunplay.

23:13.534 --> 23:17.412
I'm not ashamed of pissing away
the money on hard living either

23:17.496 --> 23:19.247
because I'm that kind of guy.

23:20.750 --> 23:24.085
But as a concession to me
for my cooperation,

23:24.128 --> 23:27.422
I would like you all to refer to me
from now on

23:28.007 --> 23:29.841
as The Lonesome Kid.

23:31.969 --> 23:35.722
Especially in front of outsiders
here in the West.

23:36.390 --> 23:38.058
That's enough of that!

23:38.100 --> 23:41.645
Let's all go up to the bar
and make fools of ourselves.

24:01.832 --> 24:04.668
I haven't danced liked that since Chicago.

24:05.670 --> 24:07.504
I'm Tom Logan.

24:07.588 --> 24:11.800
I'd like to congratulate you, sir
on your treatment of that imposter.

24:15.304 --> 24:17.639
-My daughter, Jane.
-Hello.

24:18.641 --> 24:21.476
People have told me that
I should talk to you, Mr. Braxton.

24:21.560 --> 24:25.105
I just sold a family implement business
up in the Shonkin Range

24:25.815 --> 24:27.565
and I'm thinking of buying a small ranch.

24:30.486 --> 24:33.988
You done so well,
I'd like a piece out by you for good luck.

24:38.119 --> 24:41.079
Well, the Cannon Ranch is for sale.

24:41.664 --> 24:44.666
Isn't much, four sections and a cabin.

24:44.709 --> 24:46.626
Pole corrals around it.

24:46.669 --> 24:49.838
But it's well watered
and pretty fair shelter.

24:51.465 --> 24:52.966
The owner's living in town now,

24:53.008 --> 24:56.344
has a cooperage down at the end of Main,
past the livery.

24:58.723 --> 25:01.307
I understand
you had some rustling problems.

25:02.059 --> 25:04.060
Seven percent losses per annum.

25:06.397 --> 25:09.858
You should know about that.
First year, that might just break you.

25:13.779 --> 25:17.365
I understand
you had to hang someone here.

25:19.118 --> 25:20.493
I did that.

25:22.121 --> 25:23.580
That's tough.

25:25.541 --> 25:28.293
What was this, some kind of a desperado?

25:29.086 --> 25:31.713
No. He was a thief.

25:32.298 --> 25:35.550
With probably a million good reasons
for being on hard times.

25:35.926 --> 25:38.386
The main thing is that
we put him out of his misery.

25:43.476 --> 25:46.060
Don't you believe in hanging thieves, miss?

25:46.145 --> 25:48.229
No, sir, I don't, do you?

25:48.314 --> 25:50.064
Well, I surely do.

25:50.107 --> 25:53.568
How in the world else
are we gonna have law and order?

25:55.029 --> 25:56.905
Well, what do you know?

25:57.656 --> 26:01.868
Maybe you can buy that Cannon Ranch,
get yourself started in the cattle business.

26:01.911 --> 26:04.579
'Cause with an attitude toward
human life like you have,

26:04.622 --> 26:07.749
you may yet get to be
one of the barons of this prairie

26:07.792 --> 26:10.084
and have your picture up on page one,

26:10.127 --> 26:12.462
or page three anyway,
of the Chicago papers.

26:12.713 --> 26:17.592
And for your birthday you can have
a big barrel of fresh oysters on ice,

26:17.635 --> 26:20.929
just the way the other hangmen
up this way do.

26:22.014 --> 26:23.932
You sound bitter, lady.

26:25.267 --> 26:27.227
You should've seen that young man's face.

26:28.354 --> 26:31.272
-He did not die quickly.
-I don't want to hear about it, miss.

26:31.315 --> 26:34.275
I don't think that you can
really picture the man's face.

26:34.318 --> 26:36.611
I don't want to hear about it, miss.

26:38.823 --> 26:41.366
Thank you for your information,
Mr. Braxton.

26:41.617 --> 26:46.120
I'll go over at the cooperage and ask
Mr. Cannon about them four sections.

26:47.248 --> 26:49.541
Pleasure to meet you too, miss.

27:06.767 --> 27:08.518
It's up to Tom now.

27:09.144 --> 27:11.104
Damn, I feel better now.

27:12.481 --> 27:14.983
-Damned if I don't.
-Me, too.

27:20.322 --> 27:22.448
I see him. Hold it.

27:23.701 --> 27:26.995
-Oh, God! You didn't cut him down, yet.
-We did!

27:33.586 --> 27:36.337
-Oh, God!
-Oh, Pete.

27:37.172 --> 27:39.340
Oh, my God, they've killed my man.

27:46.599 --> 27:49.183
Where the hell you clodhoppers been at?

27:49.685 --> 27:51.352
-File that.
-What is it?

27:51.395 --> 27:53.062
Get the guns. Let's go for a ride.

27:53.147 --> 27:54.480
I wanna go to a whorehouse.

27:54.523 --> 27:56.441
I wanna play some cards.
I wanna get drunk.

27:56.525 --> 27:58.735
We can go to the whorehouse
and do all that later.

27:58.819 --> 28:01.321
What's the matter with you?
Ain't you got no pride of ownership?

28:01.363 --> 28:02.572
I buy you a brand new ranch,

28:02.656 --> 28:04.574
don't you even wanna ride out
and look at it?

28:04.658 --> 28:06.701
-Hell, we own it. We can go anytime.
-Yeah?

28:06.785 --> 28:07.827
Let's go for a drink.

28:07.870 --> 28:09.621
Let's play some cards
and get some woman.

28:09.705 --> 28:11.080
Let's go to the whorehouse.

28:11.165 --> 28:13.708
Well, you're gonna have to
pick and choose on that

28:13.751 --> 28:15.710
because the money's about all gone.

28:15.753 --> 28:17.378
Hell, the money can't be gone.

28:17.421 --> 28:19.797
-Well, it is and I'm glad.
-And I'm glad, too.

28:19.882 --> 28:22.383
-Why?
-Because robbing trains...

28:22.885 --> 28:26.804
We start a pattern of robbing trains
and we're gonna get detectives.

28:27.431 --> 28:30.892
From that moment on, you can just back
the calendar down till they hang us.

28:30.935 --> 28:32.310
That's why.

28:37.775 --> 28:40.526
I still think we should rob a bank.

28:40.569 --> 28:42.028
Rob trains, rob a bank.

28:42.613 --> 28:46.240
-All right, let's go to the whorehouse.
-Yeah.

28:55.584 --> 28:57.377
You here for a party?

29:00.005 --> 29:02.674
-That's right.
-What kind of a party?

29:10.808 --> 29:12.058
Well...

29:13.602 --> 29:15.311
You got any girls?

29:27.783 --> 29:28.825
Go on, Si.

29:38.669 --> 29:41.254
The girls here can show you
to the party rooms.

29:44.133 --> 29:46.592
-I like them ribbons.
-No, shit.

29:47.428 --> 29:49.637
Anybody want anything to eat?

29:51.640 --> 29:53.683
Well, he's the one that I want.

29:53.767 --> 29:56.394
You just come right on upstairs with me.

29:58.814 --> 30:00.648
-Come on now.
-Where's the chubby one?

30:00.733 --> 30:03.151
Take it easy, will you? Give me a kiss.

30:03.193 --> 30:04.569
Oh, yeah.

30:06.363 --> 30:09.449
Ain't that a match up?

30:09.491 --> 30:12.243
Just like you and your horse, Little Tod.

30:25.674 --> 30:27.967
Well, that one got away.

30:28.010 --> 30:29.469
You'll pay for that.

30:29.762 --> 30:32.680
In my hometown
I'm considered a dangerous person.

30:32.765 --> 30:36.100
Yeah? In your home town
a man can get a bad reputation

30:36.185 --> 30:38.061
for smoking corn silk.

30:38.812 --> 30:40.396
Coil under a rock.

30:40.481 --> 30:43.691
Well, Cary'll stay up at the Breaks,
but somebody's gotta tend this place.

30:43.776 --> 30:47.487
Well, I can tell you one damn thing,
it isn't gonna be me.

30:53.786 --> 30:56.454
I got you! I'm gonna get you, son of a bitch!

30:57.372 --> 30:59.874
Here, how about this, guys?

31:11.386 --> 31:13.346
I like this place, Cal.

31:15.808 --> 31:17.683
Yeah, I like it quiet.

31:20.896 --> 31:24.524
Cary, don't throw them tools
down there like that, please.

31:27.277 --> 31:30.696
I spent my first 18 years
on one of these God damn things

31:30.739 --> 31:33.241
working for my uncle that raised me.

31:33.283 --> 31:35.827
And I worked myself cross-eyed, too.

31:37.162 --> 31:41.082
About the only thing I had for distraction
was this dog.

31:42.918 --> 31:45.795
And I'd had the dog
since I was 10 years old.

31:47.589 --> 31:49.757
And he shot it

31:51.468 --> 31:54.262
for sticking it's tongue on a pat of butter.

31:55.973 --> 31:58.182
So I stayed one more night,

31:59.685 --> 32:01.936
then I killed his seed bull.

32:02.604 --> 32:04.814
I rustled every damned horse he had,

32:04.898 --> 32:08.651
including a racer that I sold
as a cow pony to an Indian rancher.

32:08.735 --> 32:11.112
And I took the whole damn remuda.

32:11.155 --> 32:14.615
And I come within a hair's breadth
of sending his sorry hide to kingdom come.

32:14.700 --> 32:18.703
I mean, I was that close to shooting
that son of a bitch in the brainpan.

32:23.625 --> 32:26.627
Well, I never did have
that kind of background.

32:27.171 --> 32:29.297
Never had nothing, neither.

32:29.923 --> 32:31.340
My folks always wanted a place.

32:31.425 --> 32:34.969
They was good people so I always
sort of saw it with their eyes, you know.

32:35.012 --> 32:36.637
Yeah, I see that.

32:37.181 --> 32:39.182
But when you think about It,

32:39.266 --> 32:42.602
you wouldn't want the weight
of a damn place like this.

32:46.732 --> 32:49.192
Do you do alterations, too, ma'am?

32:52.404 --> 32:53.654
Nope.

32:56.033 --> 33:00.828
And I don't do your
wire ripped shirts, neither.

33:06.001 --> 33:07.543
There you go.

33:07.628 --> 33:11.088
Si, you're beginning to sound
like a real old lady.

33:11.506 --> 33:14.634
What do you say we just jump
this piss-ass seamstress?

33:14.676 --> 33:18.346
You guys are soon gonna learn
to treat me nice.

33:21.683 --> 33:23.601
Come on, I'll kill you!

33:23.685 --> 33:27.104
And everybody's so scared of
the damn Mounties that nobody even tries.

33:27.189 --> 33:29.023
These horses ain't even half guarded.

33:29.066 --> 33:31.359
Are you gonna talk to me
about Canada again?

33:31.443 --> 33:33.527
You're God damn right I am.

33:34.821 --> 33:36.948
Them Mounties scares me, Cal.

33:37.032 --> 33:38.866
Why, hell, they scare everybody.

33:38.909 --> 33:40.660
That's why it's gonna be so easy.

33:40.702 --> 33:42.870
The Indians won't even touch them horses.

33:42.913 --> 33:45.873
We can take all 60 of them ponies at a walk.

33:49.419 --> 33:51.212
All Canadian government brand?

33:52.005 --> 33:54.465
Until we can get them down
to the Breaks for modification

33:54.549 --> 33:56.676
and then down here to relay.

33:58.095 --> 34:01.013
Well, that doesn't quite settle it,
though, does it?

34:01.348 --> 34:02.890
No, it don't.

34:05.310 --> 34:07.645
Somebody's gonna have to stay here.

34:08.146 --> 34:10.356
Well, it isn't gonna be me.

34:12.025 --> 34:14.025
Well, it's gotta be one of the two of us.

34:14.069 --> 34:15.652
And I'll tell you one God damn thing...

34:15.737 --> 34:19.447
You had all the fun on that train
while I had to baby-sit these savages.

34:19.533 --> 34:23.119
And I'm going to Canada for sure.
That's settled. Now, that's it.

34:41.638 --> 34:45.141
I gotta stay on this
God damn piece of ground.

34:45.225 --> 34:48.143
God damn! I can't even believe this.

34:51.440 --> 34:53.065
Shit, that's pitiful.

34:53.608 --> 34:55.650
You assholes will just get lost.

34:56.737 --> 34:58.779
He was the best foreman
in the entire territory.

34:58.822 --> 35:00.948
He's the only foreman I ever had.

35:01.616 --> 35:03.993
-Pete Marker was a hard man.
-Amen.

35:04.077 --> 35:05.703
Surely he was, David.

35:05.787 --> 35:09.040
He could break out a good stride horse
better than the bronc fighters.

35:09.124 --> 35:10.791
He could do every job he asked you to do.

35:10.876 --> 35:12.752
He was a great ramrod.

35:12.794 --> 35:13.794
Yes, he was.

35:13.879 --> 35:18.382
He personified the American West
in the days of its rowdy youth.

35:18.467 --> 35:19.842
Sure did.

35:19.926 --> 35:21.218
Excuse me.

36:12.938 --> 36:14.063
Lee Clayton.

36:14.147 --> 36:17.608
Oh, my God, you gave me a scare.
All I could see was your horse.

36:17.692 --> 36:20.277
Well, that was all you were meant to see.

36:21.363 --> 36:22.613
Is the owner about?

36:24.574 --> 36:26.992
Who may I say is calling?

36:27.536 --> 36:28.869
Lee Clayton.

36:29.704 --> 36:30.913
I just said that.

36:32.207 --> 36:34.041
I have a short memory.

36:37.712 --> 36:40.506
Well, I'll tell Daddy that you're here

36:40.549 --> 36:43.467
and then I can get back to what I was doing
before the horse trick.

36:43.552 --> 36:47.221
Tell him Lee Clayton,
from Medicine Hat, Wyoming,

36:47.681 --> 36:49.140
here on business.

36:49.433 --> 36:51.559
-You got it?
-Yes.

37:11.830 --> 37:14.623
-Come in. I've been expecting you.
-Sir.

37:15.792 --> 37:19.462
I don't know why
it would not have tired me more than it did

37:19.546 --> 37:23.299
to have traveled all this distance
without more than a cat nap.

37:25.260 --> 37:28.721
You know, you've a wonderful
set of books here, sir.

37:28.763 --> 37:31.015
-Yes, I have.
-Truly, truly beautiful.

37:31.099 --> 37:33.434
I don't spend the time with them I should.

37:33.518 --> 37:35.352
Well, I'm of the opinion,

37:35.937 --> 37:38.314
I would only claim books

37:38.398 --> 37:40.733
that was about right from wrong.

37:40.775 --> 37:44.737
Otherwise, how are we to find
our paradise among the stars?

37:45.947 --> 37:47.448
True. Please.

37:49.534 --> 37:52.495
Sir, I'm sorry for your trouble.

37:52.787 --> 37:54.038
I wasn't aware.

37:54.122 --> 37:57.625
Gentlemen, Robert E. Lee Clayton.

38:02.506 --> 38:04.965
I understand that you hung a thief

38:05.050 --> 38:08.385
and that you neglected to find out
where they were caching the stock.

38:08.470 --> 38:09.970
How was that?

38:10.305 --> 38:12.723
He didn't want to talk
and he was about to die.

38:13.975 --> 38:15.309
I see.

38:15.352 --> 38:17.269
-Well, then you pampered him.
-No!

38:17.312 --> 38:19.313
-That's an outrage.
-We hung that man.

38:19.397 --> 38:22.149
-We hung that man.
-You pampered the man!

38:22.651 --> 38:25.027
You pampered the man
and the result of that

38:25.111 --> 38:27.780
is the loss of this poor man's life!

38:29.699 --> 38:31.492
But please, this is outrageous.

38:33.328 --> 38:35.579
Please take your hands off!

38:36.039 --> 38:37.957
And realize the fact

38:38.917 --> 38:42.419
that as a result of that
this poor man has lost his life!

38:42.504 --> 38:44.797
And if you'd invited me
into the neighborhood before,

38:44.839 --> 38:46.173
it wouldn't have happened.

38:46.258 --> 38:47.841
What kind of a man is he?

38:48.468 --> 38:50.844
You've got to give me some thoughts.

38:52.681 --> 38:54.515
I'm gonna turn my horse out.

38:55.517 --> 38:57.017
Then I'll wash my body.

38:58.562 --> 38:59.979
And miss,

39:00.939 --> 39:03.065
the only thing not on my diet

39:03.984 --> 39:06.610
would be the green top of the beet

39:06.987 --> 39:08.362
and okra.

39:08.780 --> 39:10.656
Ladies and gentlemen, excuse me,

39:10.699 --> 39:13.242
but I'm under a severe attack from a tooth.

39:14.244 --> 39:15.536
Sir.

39:16.162 --> 39:17.454
Miss.

39:24.296 --> 39:26.714
-Where'd he come from?
-What was all that about?

39:26.756 --> 39:29.174
I got unequivocal recommendations
for this man

39:29.217 --> 39:31.552
from all the Wyoming outfits
he's worked for.

39:31.595 --> 39:35.014
-I've been assured that he's a top regulator.
-That clunk, regulator?

39:35.056 --> 39:36.974
You mean to say you asked him up here?

39:37.058 --> 39:38.767
You're damn right I did.

39:39.352 --> 39:42.855
They killed my ramrod
and I want them to pay for it.

39:42.897 --> 39:45.441
You know, I always did wonder
what Lee Clayton looked like.

39:45.525 --> 39:46.984
And smelled like.

39:48.278 --> 39:50.779
I always figured he would be a little fellow.

39:50.864 --> 39:54.575
He's supposed to have a Creedmoor rifle
he carries as a saddle gun.

39:54.659 --> 39:57.077
Supposed to be able to hit out to 500 yards.

39:57.162 --> 39:58.412
Mr. Rate!

39:59.623 --> 40:01.165
He never carries a sidearm,

40:01.249 --> 40:03.334
so you know the son of a gun
is a dry gulcher.

40:03.418 --> 40:05.252
He smells like a wet tub.

40:07.088 --> 40:10.257
He don't have no life
but he sure does keeps himself spruced up.

40:10.342 --> 40:11.925
Many a rustler's said his prayers

40:12.010 --> 40:15.721
when he got a whiff of them
lavender bath salts and sagebrush.

40:22.896 --> 40:25.356
-Daddy, I wanna know how you...
-Not now, dear.

40:26.608 --> 40:30.277
-Vern, scat, out of here, go.
-I will. You betcha, I will.

40:30.403 --> 40:31.570
<i>Adios,</i> buddies.

40:31.613 --> 40:33.989
Send you a postal card from Canada.

40:34.991 --> 40:37.451
Cal, why can't I go to Canada?

40:37.494 --> 40:40.412
'Cause you gotta tend to the cabin
in the Breaks, Cary.

40:40.455 --> 40:42.498
You don't hear Tom complaining, do you?

40:42.582 --> 40:44.750
See you in a few weeks, Tom!

40:51.466 --> 40:54.551
They'll be back, Buck.
Don't you worry about it.

41:05.647 --> 41:09.274
Well, by gosh! Good morning to you, miss.

41:09.317 --> 41:11.610
Good morning to you, Mr. Logan.

41:11.653 --> 41:14.738
-You bought this place already, huh?
-Yes, ma'am.

41:15.156 --> 41:18.992
Well, I guess that kind of makes us
neighbors then, doesn't it?

41:20.787 --> 41:22.496
Where are you headed?

41:23.081 --> 41:25.165
I'm gonna go over on the table.

41:25.208 --> 41:28.502
-Well, may I accompany you?
-No.

41:29.587 --> 41:30.796
Why not?

41:31.506 --> 41:33.966
No good reason.
I just don't want any company.

41:34.008 --> 41:36.343
Well, come on, give me a chance.

41:37.011 --> 41:40.013
Give you a chance?
Give you a chance for what?

41:40.849 --> 41:43.434
You know, miss,
I'm gonna take this opportunity

41:43.518 --> 41:45.686
to be just a little damn bit offended.

41:46.479 --> 41:51.191
'Cause if there's anybody in this district
got a right to think of theyselves

41:51.693 --> 41:56.363
as wholesome companionship,
why, it's yours truly.

42:00.994 --> 42:03.245
Well, if you're such
a wholesome companion

42:03.329 --> 42:05.706
what were you doing at the whorehouse?

42:06.708 --> 42:08.542
Who in the world told you that?

42:08.585 --> 42:11.754
Mary O'Connell,
that little blonde you paid for.

42:11.838 --> 42:14.423
Well, I hope that's all she told you.

42:14.507 --> 42:15.674
She told me everything.

42:15.717 --> 42:20.053
We're kind of starved for news out here.
All I ever hear about is grass.

42:20.096 --> 42:21.889
What's the matter with grass?

42:21.973 --> 42:25.517
Samuel Johnson said,
''A blade of grass is a blade of grass,

42:25.560 --> 42:28.145
''now tell me something about
a human being.''

42:29.189 --> 42:31.482
-I don't understand that at all.
-It just means

42:31.566 --> 42:34.735
that Samuel Johnson was as bored
as I am with nature.

42:34.819 --> 42:37.988
We had a famous painter out here last year,
natural scenes.

42:38.072 --> 42:40.324
That man must have painted
10 square miles of canvas,

42:40.408 --> 42:41.992
not one human face.

42:42.076 --> 42:44.745
And I wish he could have been here
to paint that boy, Sandy,

42:44.788 --> 42:47.581
hanging up so decoratively
against the mountains.

42:47.665 --> 42:49.792
Because his pink tongue, and his white face

42:49.876 --> 42:52.795
would have just set off
the green of Montana splendidly.

42:52.879 --> 42:56.548
I mean, it would have made
the damndest bank calendar you ever saw.

42:58.968 --> 43:00.469
Well, you succeeded.

43:00.553 --> 43:03.180
This was where I was coming to
and you're still with me.

43:03.264 --> 43:05.599
The persistence of the young rancher.

43:05.683 --> 43:09.102
Well, I know what I want, is all.

43:09.187 --> 43:10.521
What do you want?

43:10.605 --> 43:13.565
I mean, I know what it is
when I want something.

43:14.442 --> 43:15.734
Come on.

43:16.277 --> 43:17.611
Come on what?

43:17.695 --> 43:19.947
Why don't you just say what you mean?

43:20.323 --> 43:22.324
This is what I mean.

43:22.408 --> 43:23.951
Do you want me?

43:25.119 --> 43:26.620
What does that mean?

43:26.663 --> 43:29.081
I mean that you're following me around
on your damn horse.

43:29.123 --> 43:30.999
-What have you got in mind?
-Me?

43:31.084 --> 43:32.793
Sexual intercourse?

43:34.629 --> 43:37.130
-Oh, my.
-Well, all right.

43:37.549 --> 43:38.966
All right.

43:39.300 --> 43:41.718
Come on. Get down off your horse.

43:42.846 --> 43:45.597
Now, I'm not gonna have
any hesitation from you.

43:45.640 --> 43:48.642
Not from a frequenter of whores.
Now, get down from your horse.

43:48.726 --> 43:50.602
All right, just back off.

43:50.645 --> 43:53.105
I'm gonna step down with my own speed.

43:55.859 --> 43:57.150
All right.

44:00.071 --> 44:02.281
I'm going to lose it right here.

44:02.615 --> 44:04.825
In all these blades of grass.

44:06.202 --> 44:07.703
Do I have to come to you?

44:07.787 --> 44:09.496
-All right.
-Hold it.

44:10.498 --> 44:13.333
-What?
-Who asked you to do all this?

44:13.960 --> 44:17.004
-Well, your entire behavior is...
-Never mind that.

44:17.088 --> 44:20.090
I didn't ask you.
You said that you wanted it.

44:20.466 --> 44:22.342
-Well, do you?
-No.

44:23.011 --> 44:24.761
-Well, then, you're not gonna get it.
-Good.

44:24.846 --> 44:27.264
Keep the dang thing, I don't want it.

44:27.348 --> 44:29.683
I forgot.
You do have your whores, don't you?

44:29.767 --> 44:31.894
Sure do. Like them, too.

44:32.353 --> 44:34.187
Well, I'll tell you something,

44:34.272 --> 44:36.273
-if you want them more...
-I keep telling you,

44:36.357 --> 44:39.192
I want them a lot. I don't want you at all.

44:39.360 --> 44:41.612
Well, why are you being so mean to me?

44:42.113 --> 44:45.699
People have been neglecting to tell you
what a nasty little bitch you are

44:45.742 --> 44:48.493
and I'm just having to make up
for their negligence.

44:48.536 --> 44:51.747
I just seem mean. I'm only being thorough.

44:57.337 --> 44:59.254
Well, if you're gonna start that,

44:59.339 --> 45:03.133
I'm just gonna go home
and shovel steer manure on the pansies.

45:05.386 --> 45:08.680
Well, you just wait a minute
because I'm gonna stop.

45:13.227 --> 45:14.686
You gonna talk nice?

45:15.480 --> 45:17.230
I will do my best,

45:18.399 --> 45:19.775
you bastard.

45:21.736 --> 45:24.571
-Can I have a kiss?
-No, I hardly know you.

45:25.657 --> 45:29.117
Why don't we just take walk
and we'll just talk about the Wild West

45:29.202 --> 45:31.620
and how to get the hell out of it.

45:33.456 --> 45:37.376
Well, all right. I can talk about that.

45:38.586 --> 45:41.463
Cal, you know,
I forgot how to tie a diamond hitch.

45:41.547 --> 45:44.383
A squaw hitch. That's all you need
for a load that light, anyway.

45:44.425 --> 45:46.927
-You'll be gone for a couple of weeks.
-Give or take a few days.

45:46.970 --> 45:49.262
Start to move some of this stock down
to make way.

45:49.305 --> 45:51.306
-No more than two or three...
-Three at a time.

45:51.391 --> 45:53.100
Hell, I been doing this for a while,
you know.

45:53.184 --> 45:55.268
Yeah, I reckon you have. Let's go.

45:58.773 --> 46:00.273
Keep low, boy.

46:05.488 --> 46:07.447
Hell of a damn way to ride off.

46:13.621 --> 46:16.540
Stay with your horse.

46:18.126 --> 46:20.127
Stay with your horse, Si!

46:25.675 --> 46:27.300
Si, let go of the ropes.

46:27.385 --> 46:28.927
Help!

46:30.805 --> 46:32.681
He's gonna drown!

46:32.974 --> 46:34.641
Help! Give me a hand!

46:39.480 --> 46:43.233
We did it.
We crossed that son of a bitch, didn't we?

46:44.485 --> 46:46.653
-I couldn't swim, but...
-Yeah, I know.

46:46.738 --> 46:48.947
But I was swimming, right?

46:50.241 --> 46:52.034
I can, I did it!

46:52.118 --> 46:53.910
We deserve a lot of damn credit.

46:53.995 --> 46:58.665
I mean, we crossed the Mighty Mo
and I want some damn credit!

46:58.708 --> 47:03.462
Most of them catfish in that
son of a bitch could eat a pig!

47:03.504 --> 47:05.047
Or a chicken.

47:08.468 --> 47:09.676
Get up.

47:11.679 --> 47:13.221
-Easy now.
-Tom.

47:22.356 --> 47:25.859
You're the only rancher around here
who hasn't met the new regulator.

47:25.943 --> 47:28.528
Tom Logan, Robert E. Lee Clayton.

47:28.571 --> 47:31.823
It's a pleasure
to make it your acquaintance, sir.

47:33.367 --> 47:36.036
Damn near sucked my boot off.

47:37.663 --> 47:40.791
Pleasure to meet you, Regulator.

47:41.542 --> 47:43.835
Ain't that like a dry gulcher?

47:43.878 --> 47:47.130
That's not the softest term
you could use, I'd say.

47:47.465 --> 47:51.134
Well, Regulator,
correct me now if I'm wrong.

47:51.803 --> 47:54.137
Isn't a regulator one of these boys

47:55.306 --> 47:57.766
that shoots people
and don't never get near them?

47:57.850 --> 47:59.184
That's it.

48:01.896 --> 48:03.063
Well...

48:04.065 --> 48:06.983
What about the binoculars?
What are they for?

48:07.151 --> 48:10.946
Well, I've taken to watching
funny-looking birds.

48:12.573 --> 48:13.782
I see.

48:14.534 --> 48:16.660
Well, hell, I don't know.

48:16.744 --> 48:21.248
I suppose if you didn't get away
off a mile or so to do the job,

48:21.290 --> 48:23.667
you'd just get messy like I done here.

48:23.751 --> 48:25.961
Easy, Tom. Don't let me down.

48:26.587 --> 48:30.924
I've just had to hear this from all the other
dreamers trying to ranch around here.

48:31.259 --> 48:34.344
Lee, did you ever hit a man from a mile off

48:34.929 --> 48:37.556
while he was carrying a pail of water?

48:37.932 --> 48:39.599
A mile, well...

48:40.768 --> 48:42.978
But I don't remember the pail.

48:44.272 --> 48:45.522
No, sir.

48:47.108 --> 48:51.486
When you hang a man, you usually...
He has a chance to talk

48:52.780 --> 48:55.157
or say goodbye, write a letter.

48:55.950 --> 48:57.784
Besides, a Creedmoor.

49:00.246 --> 49:01.663
That's a Creedmoor, isn't it?

49:01.747 --> 49:04.666
It is a Creedmoor, sir, and a beautiful one.

49:04.750 --> 49:07.502
Must make a pretty good mess of a human.

49:07.712 --> 49:10.881
When you hit a guy from 500 yards out,

49:10.965 --> 49:12.465
say, why, the suddenness of it,

49:12.550 --> 49:16.469
he don't even have a few seconds
to make his Act of Contrition.

49:16.888 --> 49:19.556
Not only that,
but you never have to look him in the eye.

49:19.640 --> 49:21.975
Right there, that makes all the difference.

49:22.059 --> 49:23.810
I would disagree with you, sir.

49:23.895 --> 49:26.605
The thing that makes all the difference
in the world, I believe,

49:26.647 --> 49:29.733
is the fact that it accomplishes
the task, you see.

49:31.903 --> 49:33.945
This old boy in Wyoming...

49:37.158 --> 49:39.659
This old boy in Wyoming,
he sat down on the ground,

49:39.702 --> 49:41.995
just to pull sandburs out of his trousers

49:42.079 --> 49:44.331
and his skull just suddenly flew into pieces

49:44.415 --> 49:46.541
about the size of your thumbnail.

49:46.626 --> 49:51.046
That was the first time
I ever heard the term ''regulator.''

49:51.589 --> 49:53.632
That was the first time?

49:53.716 --> 49:55.050
First time.

49:58.095 --> 50:00.680
What would be your line of work, sir?

50:01.057 --> 50:04.267
I used to be in the implement business
up in the Shonkin Sag,

50:04.352 --> 50:07.354
but I started back in to ranch south of here.

50:08.689 --> 50:11.358
When you started back in, it was before?

50:12.276 --> 50:16.821
My family used to have a place
but when they lost it I hired out.

50:17.365 --> 50:18.823
I see.

50:18.866 --> 50:22.202
Well, I certainly wish you
good fortune, Mr. Logan.

50:23.329 --> 50:26.831
You know, the times are hard.
I'm a small operator.

50:29.794 --> 50:33.088
And I hope the damn horse thieves
leaves you something.

50:33.172 --> 50:34.756
I hope so, too.

50:34.840 --> 50:37.384
-Good day to you, sir.
-Bye-bye, now.

50:38.803 --> 50:42.847
I think this colt of yours will be all right
if you can find a wet mare.

50:42.890 --> 50:44.891
-Is the mother dead?
-Yeah.

50:44.934 --> 50:48.728
She got bogged down in a mire
about a mile from here.

50:49.480 --> 50:51.523
See you later, Tom. Thanks.

50:51.565 --> 50:54.859
-All right, Mr. Braxton.
-Damn those hands of mine.

50:56.946 --> 50:58.822
Good luck, Old Sloppy.

51:11.794 --> 51:13.962
Must have smelled something.

51:14.046 --> 51:17.882
Closer you get towards Canada
the more things eat your horses.

51:19.677 --> 51:23.096
Probably smelled a bear or a cat
or some damn thing.

51:23.723 --> 51:27.100
Either one of them just go ahead
and eat your horses up.

51:29.270 --> 51:30.478
Easy.

51:32.481 --> 51:33.648
Damn!

51:34.108 --> 51:37.610
I don't why they had to put Canada
way the hell up here.

51:48.372 --> 51:50.707
Well, hello, Jane.

51:51.876 --> 51:53.251
Hello, Tom.

51:55.254 --> 51:57.630
I didn't think I'd find you here.

51:57.715 --> 51:59.382
Why'd you think that?

51:59.467 --> 52:00.633
'Cause I haven't seen you.

52:01.844 --> 52:05.805
You thought I was gonna come courting,
didn't you?

52:06.724 --> 52:08.016
Maybe so.

52:09.477 --> 52:13.855
You was too harsh to me last time.
I never kick a dead horse, lady.

52:17.777 --> 52:20.278
That sure is some garden
you've started here.

52:20.321 --> 52:22.447
Have you had one before?

52:23.282 --> 52:27.160
No. My aunt had one
and I kind of took it over.

52:28.329 --> 52:30.622
I ain't half bad at it, though.

52:31.916 --> 52:33.041
No.

52:36.337 --> 52:38.963
Why don't you get down off your horse?

52:39.507 --> 52:41.216
I will, thank you.

52:45.679 --> 52:48.681
You're a lot nicer than you was before.
Why is that?

52:51.435 --> 52:55.271
Well, you didn't come courting me
like I figured you would and I...

52:58.776 --> 53:00.068
You what?

53:01.362 --> 53:03.571
I'm trying to revive your interest.

53:04.698 --> 53:05.865
Yeah?

53:08.911 --> 53:12.038
Come here a minute,
and I'll show you something.

53:17.878 --> 53:19.212
All right.

53:20.798 --> 53:22.465
Now, lift that up.

53:38.691 --> 53:41.734
Close her down. Garden's watered.

53:45.072 --> 53:46.573
I admire you.

53:48.242 --> 53:49.909
Come on in the house.

53:49.952 --> 53:52.704
I'll make you cup of Chinee tea.

53:52.746 --> 53:54.205
Chinee tea?

54:05.176 --> 54:08.428
Northern Pacific Railroad?
Where did you get these?

54:09.597 --> 54:10.638
Just souvenirs.

54:22.318 --> 54:24.444
How long does the tea take?

54:25.279 --> 54:27.030
Five or ten minutes.

54:32.328 --> 54:34.204
Can I come over there?

54:38.751 --> 54:41.377
I'll come over there if you ask me to.

54:48.969 --> 54:50.512
Let's go over there.

54:57.645 --> 54:59.437
You sure about that?

55:03.317 --> 55:04.776
That's right.

55:07.071 --> 55:09.614
How do you know you're sure about that?

55:11.116 --> 55:12.992
Well, why do you think?

55:15.996 --> 55:20.083
'Cause that's the reason why
you come out here in the first place.

55:22.127 --> 55:23.127
That's right.

55:27.508 --> 55:30.218
This here tea's gonna get black as ink.

55:34.598 --> 55:37.225
We'll write somebody a letter with it.

55:40.521 --> 55:42.939
Let's write your father a letter.

55:43.440 --> 55:48.278
Tell him that you're the prisoner
of the Chinee Tea Slavers.

56:22.563 --> 56:24.230
Would you like to do this?

56:27.985 --> 56:29.110
Yeah.

56:29.737 --> 56:31.279
I would like to.

56:32.573 --> 56:34.907
That's what I would like to do.

56:45.002 --> 56:46.294
I'm sorry.

57:24.750 --> 57:25.833
God.

58:30.774 --> 58:33.609
God damn. That's pretty.

58:34.153 --> 58:37.196
Yeah. They're neat little bastards,
ain't they?

58:39.199 --> 58:42.243
Boy, there's more of them than I expected.

58:42.327 --> 58:46.038
Yeah. Do you suppose them catfish
ever look up?

58:46.373 --> 58:48.499
-Piss on them.
-From up here?

58:56.717 --> 58:59.385
Supposed to be the best police
in the world.

58:59.428 --> 59:02.555
-They don't scare me.
-Me, neither.

59:03.390 --> 59:07.101
Come on, let's take these horses
to the home of the brave

59:07.186 --> 59:09.312
-and land of the free.
-Not today.

59:09.396 --> 59:11.272
-What do you mean?
-Not today.

59:19.782 --> 59:23.743
I'm gonna have an awful lot of explaining
to do when I get home.

59:23.827 --> 59:26.829
But I'm not going to lie my way
out of this one.

59:27.581 --> 59:28.915
Yes, I am.

59:30.000 --> 59:32.919
-Which one?
-I'm gonna lie my way out of it.

59:35.088 --> 59:37.131
-Where did she go?
-Who?

59:37.549 --> 59:38.758
Your ma.

59:40.761 --> 59:45.556
Well, she listened very carefully
to my father for about three years,

59:45.599 --> 59:47.517
weighed every word,

59:47.601 --> 59:51.562
and then she up and ran off with the first
unreasonable man that she could find.

59:53.690 --> 59:54.941
Wait a minute. Stop.

59:55.025 --> 59:58.444
Look, this is a nice way to ride,
but I know a much better way.

59:59.905 --> 01:00:03.199
-What? Where you going?
-Just wait.

01:00:12.835 --> 01:00:15.461
-Well, that is clever.
-Yeah, isn't it?

01:00:16.129 --> 01:00:18.881
Would you say that this is lewd conduct?

01:00:19.967 --> 01:00:22.385
Well, I couldn't say for sure.

01:00:23.428 --> 01:00:27.849
My father has a library full of law books,
'cause he believes in the law.

01:00:27.933 --> 01:00:31.310
And he says that we haven't
got any law up here, yet.

01:00:33.105 --> 01:00:34.897
What brings that to your mind?

01:00:35.691 --> 01:00:38.109
Because in one of those law books of his

01:00:38.151 --> 01:00:40.570
there's a whole section on lewd conduct.

01:00:41.572 --> 01:00:43.072
What about it?

01:00:43.657 --> 01:00:45.491
It's against the law.

01:00:52.666 --> 01:00:53.958
Are you an outlaw?

01:00:58.797 --> 01:01:01.549
I'm a jackpot rancher with a milk cow

01:01:01.633 --> 01:01:04.594
and a 100 square foot
of root vegetables. Why?

01:01:05.345 --> 01:01:07.513
Why do you have so many guns?

01:01:07.806 --> 01:01:09.765
Because I'm a sportsman.

01:01:11.435 --> 01:01:14.312
Why do you have a sawed-off shotgun?

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:18.232
Well, because, I'm a sawed-off sportsman.

01:01:22.279 --> 01:01:25.156
Well, something has sure started
in my thinking,

01:01:25.198 --> 01:01:29.285
I don't know why we should go on,
if you're just gonna end up dead.

01:01:33.707 --> 01:01:37.209
Can we get down here for a while?

01:01:41.173 --> 01:01:42.882
-Yeah, okay.
-You can make it?

01:02:52.119 --> 01:02:55.329
Now, they've locked in with Jesus.
Let's do it.

01:02:56.289 --> 01:02:58.624
Makes me feel real safe and peaceful.

01:02:58.667 --> 01:03:06.667
Well, that's what Sunday's are for.

01:04:36.223 --> 01:04:39.683
For the best police in the world
them Mounties are dumber than sticks.

01:04:39.726 --> 01:04:42.728
-We just walked them backwards.
-Pipe down. Cut it.

01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:05.000
Damn.

01:05:06.086 --> 01:05:08.838
Shouldn't crawl up on people like that.

01:05:10.215 --> 01:05:12.466
Well, I'm not the crawling kind.

01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:15.261
I was just passing by.

01:05:15.345 --> 01:05:17.930
I thought I'd ask you a question or two.

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:22.935
There was a family of Logans
out at K.C. Wyoming.

01:05:22.978 --> 01:05:24.436
There was four brothers.

01:05:24.479 --> 01:05:26.647
The youngest was a kid
by the name of Lonnie.

01:05:26.731 --> 01:05:28.774
They was all pretty quick, you know.

01:05:28.817 --> 01:05:31.735
Except for Lonnie, he was a fiddle player,

01:05:31.778 --> 01:05:34.280
and they killed him off right quick.

01:05:34.364 --> 01:05:38.159
'Cause some of the ranchers
found him thieving or something like that.

01:05:38.243 --> 01:05:41.412
Anyway, I was wondering,
would they be kin to you?

01:05:42.956 --> 01:05:44.456
No.

01:05:44.791 --> 01:05:47.960
Well, I didn't think so,
because you don't carry a gun.

01:05:49.546 --> 01:05:51.505
No, I never carry a gun.

01:05:54.134 --> 01:05:55.509
I never wear a gun, neither.

01:05:56.386 --> 01:06:00.931
Once in a while
I carry this little darling around.

01:06:00.974 --> 01:06:02.975
She's almost like a poem.

01:06:03.059 --> 01:06:06.812
You know, it's all hand done.
Etched, you know.

01:06:06.897 --> 01:06:09.773
Scratched in silver. She's a beauty.

01:06:09.816 --> 01:06:13.777
Made for the President of Mexico.
I diverted it for a $100 bill.

01:06:13.987 --> 01:06:15.946
But it doesn't shoot worth a damn.

01:06:18.867 --> 01:06:21.493
Some damn fool came along and filed off

01:06:22.621 --> 01:06:24.997
the top of the front sight there.

01:06:26.791 --> 01:06:29.418
And, you have to sort of play with it.

01:06:34.507 --> 01:06:36.008
It isn't easy.

01:06:36.676 --> 01:06:38.594
Have a look at the rope.

01:06:43.391 --> 01:06:45.935
Not bad. There's one left.

01:06:55.737 --> 01:06:57.154
I doubt it.

01:07:16.132 --> 01:07:17.549
You're smart.

01:07:20.262 --> 01:07:22.054
Farmers ain't smart.

01:07:22.472 --> 01:07:25.099
I don't know just exactly where
you came from

01:07:25.183 --> 01:07:29.061
or what you were doing,
but I think you ought to go back to it

01:07:29.104 --> 01:07:31.188
because you can't farm worth a spit.

01:07:36.403 --> 01:07:37.653
Unless...

01:07:38.405 --> 01:07:40.114
You lost your nerve.

01:07:40.949 --> 01:07:44.660
And in that case, cabbages
is just what the doctor ordered.

01:07:52.961 --> 01:07:54.586
Is your nerve gone?

01:08:06.808 --> 01:08:08.309
Easy, easy.

01:08:13.565 --> 01:08:16.191
We're home, boys. We'll bed down soon.

01:08:17.234 --> 01:08:20.112
How're we gonna get them to swim
across the Mighty Mo?

01:08:20.154 --> 01:08:23.073
If we get one or two to go, they'll all go.

01:08:23.116 --> 01:08:24.825
Here's the Breaks!

01:08:26.077 --> 01:08:28.996
Back in the USA. What a relief.

01:08:35.377 --> 01:08:36.754
Boys.

01:08:41.634 --> 01:08:43.260
-Mounties!
-They can handle weapons.

01:08:43.303 --> 01:08:44.303
Come on, move!

01:08:45.305 --> 01:08:53.305
Let's get out of here.

01:09:48.993 --> 01:09:51.870
I wonder where Little Tod
got himself off to.

01:09:53.872 --> 01:09:55.374
I don't know.

01:09:57.293 --> 01:09:59.795
I don't know where my finger is, either.

01:10:01.089 --> 01:10:02.589
Them Mounties.

01:10:03.216 --> 01:10:06.635
Followed us right into
the United States of America,

01:10:07.178 --> 01:10:09.054
got their horses back.

01:10:10.473 --> 01:10:12.224
It's not even legal!

01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:15.894
We'll tie that hand up and let's move.

01:10:15.979 --> 01:10:23.979
Maybe we'll catch up with Little Tod
at the Snake's Cross.

01:12:48.381 --> 01:12:49.506
Hey, there.

01:12:56.097 --> 01:12:58.890
Do you always get off your horse that way?

01:13:01.102 --> 01:13:02.394
I'm not chasing you.

01:13:03.855 --> 01:13:05.897
Who in the hell did you think
was after you?

01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:08.734
This is supposed to be the haunt
of thieves and killers.

01:13:08.776 --> 01:13:11.069
Shit. Here.

01:13:11.696 --> 01:13:16.074
This ain't the haunt of nothing
but diamondbacks and old farts like me.

01:13:18.745 --> 01:13:20.203
Who are you?

01:13:20.538 --> 01:13:22.748
Well, my name's Jim Ferguson.

01:13:23.791 --> 01:13:26.293
I'm pleased to meet you,
what's your name?

01:13:26.377 --> 01:13:27.919
Tod La Frambois.

01:13:28.379 --> 01:13:29.755
La Frambois?

01:13:32.008 --> 01:13:35.093
-What's your trade there, Mr. La Frambois?
-Trade?

01:13:35.637 --> 01:13:39.139
Well, I've been in
the farm implement business.

01:13:40.141 --> 01:13:44.269
Now I'm looking to get on with a ranch.
Maybe down around Absaroka.

01:13:46.022 --> 01:13:47.981
That'd be over that way.

01:13:54.405 --> 01:13:58.617
I'll tell you what.
I got a nice hare on a stick over here.

01:14:00.995 --> 01:14:03.121
Come on, let's go have a bite to eat.

01:14:04.874 --> 01:14:06.124
Come on.

01:14:16.761 --> 01:14:18.679
<i>Life is like</i>

01:14:19.639 --> 01:14:22.683
<i>A mountain railway</i>

01:14:23.643 --> 01:14:29.314
<i>With an engineer that's brave</i>

01:14:30.650 --> 01:14:36.488
<i>We must make this run successful</i>

01:14:37.448 --> 01:14:43.662
<i>From the cradle to the grave</i>

01:14:44.664 --> 01:14:47.499
<i>Heed the curves</i>

01:14:48.084 --> 01:14:50.836
<i>Build the tunnels</i>

01:14:51.671 --> 01:14:56.800
<i>Never falter, never quail</i>

01:14:56.843 --> 01:14:58.009
Never quail.

01:14:58.886 --> 01:15:04.349
<i>Keep your hand upon the throttle</i>

01:15:05.268 --> 01:15:10.689
<i>And your eye upon rail</i>

01:15:13.693 --> 01:15:15.610
-Sweet song.
-Yeah.

01:15:18.281 --> 01:15:22.576
Do you believe that life is like
a mountain railroad, Mr. La Frambois?

01:15:25.204 --> 01:15:27.539
All I know, Jim, is that

01:15:28.416 --> 01:15:31.877
life is not like anything I ever seen before.

01:15:37.717 --> 01:15:42.637
You know, it's really strange running
into a preacher out here in this hellhole.

01:15:43.890 --> 01:15:46.850
I believe that life is like a mountain railway.

01:15:48.770 --> 01:15:52.063
But not for the reasons in the song.

01:15:52.815 --> 01:15:56.943
I think life is like a mountain railway
'cause you don't have no idea

01:15:57.028 --> 01:16:00.906
what sleazy son of a bitch
has got his hand on the throttle.

01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:04.659
That's a real strange attitude
for a preacher.

01:16:11.584 --> 01:16:13.376
I ain't no preacher.

01:16:20.051 --> 01:16:21.760
Well, what do you do?

01:16:21.844 --> 01:16:24.054
I'm about a quarter-ass horse thief.

01:16:25.765 --> 01:16:28.099
Anything to get some grits in my stomach.

01:16:29.352 --> 01:16:31.770
Not doing too good at it, neither.

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:35.106
Otherwise, I wouldn't be eating hare.

01:16:35.650 --> 01:16:37.567
I'd be in Dodge City,

01:16:38.319 --> 01:16:41.863
playing with them big asses,
drinking champagne.

01:16:45.117 --> 01:16:49.621
What about yourself there, Tod?
What do you do?

01:16:50.915 --> 01:16:52.791
Well, there's really nothing to say.

01:16:53.251 --> 01:16:56.795
I'm a single man. Implement business.

01:16:59.131 --> 01:17:01.341
Where you got this implement business?

01:17:01.425 --> 01:17:03.134
It's in Big Sandy.

01:17:03.219 --> 01:17:06.972
No, I mean the Shonkin Sag.
No, I mean Big Sandy.

01:17:07.056 --> 01:17:08.849
Yeah, Big...

01:17:10.810 --> 01:17:11.977
Sandy.

01:17:12.019 --> 01:17:14.980
I was raised up in Big Sandy

01:17:15.022 --> 01:17:18.942
and there ain't a teeny weeny
implement business in Big Sandy

01:17:19.485 --> 01:17:21.820
and not in Shonkin Sag, neither.

01:17:24.574 --> 01:17:26.491
Mr. Ferguson,

01:17:26.534 --> 01:17:30.537
I'm really grateful to you
for your hospitality and everything,

01:17:31.414 --> 01:17:33.748
but my line of work
is none of your damn business.

01:17:33.833 --> 01:17:37.586
I'm sorry, Tod, I didn't mean
to get you all riled up like that.

01:17:37.670 --> 01:17:39.504
I'll tell you what...

01:17:40.089 --> 01:17:42.215
Maybe one of these days,

01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:45.302
I'll get a chance
to cook your supper for you.

01:17:46.012 --> 01:17:48.597
Hooray! A free dang meal.

01:17:50.892 --> 01:17:53.226
Good. Thank you, Tod.

01:18:00.234 --> 01:18:02.861
I hope you'll keep my business
to yourself, too.

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:07.032
-You got my word.
-That's good enough.

01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:56.831
What the hell's going on here?

01:18:57.792 --> 01:18:59.292
God damn.

01:19:00.086 --> 01:19:01.836
What the hell's the matter with you?

01:19:01.921 --> 01:19:03.380
I don't know, something...

01:19:05.508 --> 01:19:07.759
Trying to get some sleep here.

01:19:19.981 --> 01:19:23.483
Now I want you to cinch up good
on the knot there.

01:19:23.567 --> 01:19:24.776
Yeah, I did.

01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:26.820
All right, now don't have fear.

01:19:26.904 --> 01:19:29.155
That's the way my daddy taught me now.

01:19:32.118 --> 01:19:34.661
Easy aces, now. Come on.

01:19:35.371 --> 01:19:36.913
Come on.

01:19:37.164 --> 01:19:39.040
Put that down.

01:19:40.084 --> 01:19:42.585
This is the part I hate. I can't swim a lick.

01:19:42.628 --> 01:19:44.879
Don't fight it, get it? That's just what I'd do.

01:19:44.964 --> 01:19:47.841
Okay, now slide off. Slide off, let her go.

01:19:47.925 --> 01:19:50.635
Let her go. Let the horse walk on.
Hold on, that's it.

01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:52.137
Now we're doing it.

01:19:53.514 --> 01:19:57.142
I got you now. I'm holding on.
Let's float the boat.

01:19:58.436 --> 01:19:59.602
Beautiful!

01:19:59.645 --> 01:20:02.313
-This was easy.
-Hop on that beast now.

01:20:03.399 --> 01:20:06.609
Well, we're half way
to the barn now, laddie.

01:20:09.196 --> 01:20:11.990
Come on. We cut that son of a bitch.

01:20:15.036 --> 01:20:17.829
We cut that god damn thing
slicker than butter.

01:20:17.913 --> 01:20:20.540
Now, listen. You go on ahead now.

01:20:21.625 --> 01:20:24.669
You go on over there
and I'll secure the rope here.

01:20:24.754 --> 01:20:26.421
-You got a good hold on that?
-Yeah.

01:20:26.505 --> 01:20:28.673
-All right, you just go on now.
-Over there?

01:20:28.758 --> 01:20:32.635
Yeah, and then you pull me in case
something happens to me. Understand?

01:20:35.556 --> 01:20:37.098
Let her go now.

01:20:37.892 --> 01:20:39.851
I don't know about this.

01:20:42.521 --> 01:20:44.022
That's it. Go ahead.

01:20:45.274 --> 01:20:48.777
-In you go.
-The damn horse won't swim. Come on.

01:20:49.111 --> 01:20:51.321
-Dig your heels in now.
-This isn't bad.

01:20:51.363 --> 01:20:52.989
Not bad at all.

01:20:55.451 --> 01:20:56.534
Bring me in!

01:20:56.577 --> 01:20:58.828
You dirty tricker, are you gonna talk to me?

01:20:59.288 --> 01:21:01.581
You gonna tell me something now?

01:21:02.124 --> 01:21:04.709
Listen, son, you got two choices, now.

01:21:04.794 --> 01:21:07.212
Are you gonna drink
this muddy son of a bitch

01:21:07.254 --> 01:21:11.341
or are you gonna tell me about Tom Logan
and your God damn rustlers?

01:21:12.718 --> 01:21:14.052
I'm gonna give you one!

01:21:16.388 --> 01:21:18.389
Mr. La Frambois, one.

01:22:14.155 --> 01:22:16.197
That's Little Tod's horse.

01:22:16.448 --> 01:22:18.158
Damned if it ain't.

01:22:23.789 --> 01:22:26.583
What happened?
Did he get bucked off or what?

01:22:27.793 --> 01:22:29.794
-I don't know.
-Cal?

01:22:33.215 --> 01:22:35.800
-What is it?
-What the hell's going on?

01:22:36.635 --> 01:22:38.469
Just get inside.

01:22:42.433 --> 01:22:44.809
-What's happening?
-Lee Clayton.

01:22:50.232 --> 01:22:53.151
Come here, Sandy, old girl.
We're going to a picnic.

01:23:01.869 --> 01:23:03.912
He never will close that gate, will he?

01:23:03.996 --> 01:23:07.457
It wasn't near as gloomy around here
when we only had just rustlers.

01:23:07.499 --> 01:23:10.460
Never seen nothing like that, never.
Come on.

01:23:11.754 --> 01:23:15.298
I never thought Mr. Braxton
would call in a man like that.

01:23:26.101 --> 01:23:28.353
I presume you've had an enlightening trip.

01:23:32.316 --> 01:23:34.651
Well, what kind of trip did you have?

01:23:38.739 --> 01:23:40.490
What did you learn?

01:23:41.367 --> 01:23:43.451
You'll have to lower you voice for that.

01:23:43.535 --> 01:23:47.538
I feel an attack of gas
and that could be perilous to both of us.

01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:49.415
That's good.

01:23:53.796 --> 01:23:55.546
What did you learn?

01:23:59.134 --> 01:24:03.346
That the one man that could have
told me something didn't tell me nothing.

01:24:03.931 --> 01:24:07.809
And then he upped and drowned himself
in the Missouri River.

01:24:09.687 --> 01:24:12.105
You've got no further
than we did without you.

01:24:12.856 --> 01:24:16.067
I can track a bluebottle fly
right up your nose.

01:24:16.402 --> 01:24:19.279
And I've taken to tracking
what people are thinking.

01:24:20.155 --> 01:24:21.572
Where's your wife?

01:24:22.866 --> 01:24:25.034
What has that got to... Damn it!

01:24:26.495 --> 01:24:28.538
I detest your impertinence!

01:24:29.415 --> 01:24:33.710
You stay out of my private life
you lilac-smelling son of a bitch!

01:24:35.587 --> 01:24:39.299
Well, you ain't the first mental wizard
I ever met, you know.

01:24:39.383 --> 01:24:43.011
I met ranchers, outlaws, stock detectives

01:24:43.095 --> 01:24:46.180
who thought they was mental wizards
like yourself.

01:24:47.349 --> 01:24:50.601
And there was one thing
I could never understand, and that was...

01:24:51.270 --> 01:24:53.438
Why can't they hang onto their women?

01:24:54.606 --> 01:24:58.693
Well, you're beginning to rave.
And you're beginning to bore me.

01:24:58.777 --> 01:25:00.445
So you're gonna stop.

01:25:01.030 --> 01:25:03.990
You're gonna stop spying on me,
and on my family.

01:25:04.074 --> 01:25:08.953
You were never hired to do that.
I do not, and Jane does not

01:25:08.996 --> 01:25:12.957
and the dozen dotes who work for me
do not steal horses!

01:25:15.127 --> 01:25:17.086
But somebody does, don't he?

01:25:40.486 --> 01:25:43.821
Well, there's a sight for sore eyes.

01:25:45.074 --> 01:25:46.949
-Cal!
-Long time, Logan.

01:25:46.992 --> 01:25:51.204
Cal, I want you to meet a good friend
of mine. Jane Braxton.

01:25:51.413 --> 01:25:52.455
How do?

01:25:52.498 --> 01:25:54.874
Pleased to make
your acquaintance, ma'am.

01:25:54.958 --> 01:25:58.294
She was born and bred here, Cal,
and ready for city lights.

01:25:58.337 --> 01:26:01.381
Well, pretty ladies
should have what they want.

01:26:01.548 --> 01:26:03.341
How's the ranch coming, Tom?

01:26:03.384 --> 01:26:04.926
Well, you want a tour?

01:26:06.512 --> 01:26:07.720
Sure do.

01:26:22.277 --> 01:26:25.446
Cal, come on, I'll show you the orchard.
Come on, buddy.

01:26:26.115 --> 01:26:29.784
This little bastard was in sorry shape
before I got to it.

01:26:29.868 --> 01:26:33.871
These trees wouldn't have turned out
a peck of apples apiece.

01:26:34.540 --> 01:26:37.083
No wonder that guy
was making barrels in town.

01:26:37.167 --> 01:26:39.335
He sure wasn't running this place right.

01:26:39.378 --> 01:26:42.422
The tree here was all full of scale
and blight

01:26:42.506 --> 01:26:45.925
and these limbs I dug out of here
had bores all in them

01:26:46.009 --> 01:26:48.261
and insect eggs all over everything

01:26:48.345 --> 01:26:50.012
I mean, it was...

01:26:53.016 --> 01:26:54.809
Little Tod didn't come home.

01:27:03.527 --> 01:27:05.987
What the hell are you doing?
I mean, just for instance,

01:27:06.071 --> 01:27:08.406
what difference does it make
whether scale, blight or bores

01:27:08.490 --> 01:27:10.992
eats up this whole God damn ranch?

01:27:14.538 --> 01:27:16.914
Well, Cal, I just have to say it.

01:27:19.418 --> 01:27:22.420
I'd prefer that they didn't ruin the orchard.

01:27:34.933 --> 01:27:36.559
Poor Little Tod.

01:27:55.204 --> 01:27:56.913
Give me that cartridge.

01:28:02.127 --> 01:28:04.795
That girl's old man hired Lee Clayton,
didn't he?

01:28:08.383 --> 01:28:10.176
Yeah, he did.

01:28:11.345 --> 01:28:14.055
What about her, where's her husband at?

01:28:14.848 --> 01:28:17.808
She don't have a husband,
she don't need one.

01:28:18.977 --> 01:28:20.520
Don't need one?

01:28:21.772 --> 01:28:24.232
Boy, you're pretty far gone, ain't you?

01:28:25.359 --> 01:28:27.485
That's the way it happens, isn't it, Cal?

01:28:27.569 --> 01:28:29.111
I wouldn't know.

01:28:31.031 --> 01:28:34.575
Not since that dog of mine
put his tongue on the butter.

01:28:56.306 --> 01:28:59.642
-Where's Lee Clayton? Is he here?
-You betcha.

01:28:59.685 --> 01:29:02.353
Moved right in. Made himself at home.

01:29:05.857 --> 01:29:07.275
Robert Lee?

01:29:32.467 --> 01:29:33.884
Robert Lee?

01:29:39.224 --> 01:29:42.226
You know, the old man built this tub
for the old lady

01:29:42.269 --> 01:29:44.186
and she run out on him.

01:29:44.438 --> 01:29:46.981
Wasn't that you calling me out there?

01:29:47.733 --> 01:29:49.609
Yeah, son, that was me.

01:29:50.319 --> 01:29:53.237
Well, there's no way you can win,
you know.

01:29:53.322 --> 01:29:54.405
What?

01:29:54.489 --> 01:29:56.741
-There's no way you can win.
-Win?

01:29:56.825 --> 01:30:00.828
Well, it's kin of mine is all
that's what calls me Robert Lee.

01:30:00.912 --> 01:30:02.788
I'm gonna bust your fat ass.

01:30:04.625 --> 01:30:08.794
Well, I hope I can get my nourishment
spending my dinner hour here with you.

01:30:09.129 --> 01:30:13.174
You ain't gonna get no nourishment.
You're gonna dry up and blow away.

01:30:19.139 --> 01:30:21.515
But it just ain't in the cards, angel.

01:30:22.100 --> 01:30:25.686
I mean, can't you see that the list
is as long as my arm?

01:30:25.771 --> 01:30:28.606
And you come under the heading
of what I do for a living.

01:30:28.649 --> 01:30:32.318
Now step outside, for as my stomach
has commenced to growl.

01:30:34.279 --> 01:30:35.363
Are you scared?

01:30:38.450 --> 01:30:39.617
Shaking all over.

01:30:40.661 --> 01:30:43.371
It's almost like I don't have a prayer.

01:30:45.082 --> 01:30:47.958
But I can't lose this appetite. What ails me?

01:30:48.043 --> 01:30:50.294
You're just floating there
in your confirmation dress,

01:30:50.379 --> 01:30:52.380
waiting for God to save you.

01:30:52.923 --> 01:30:56.967
Did it ever bother you sitting up there
in that cabin drinking coffee,

01:30:57.052 --> 01:31:00.429
while that fiddler's wife
was screaming in the sand wash?

01:31:03.558 --> 01:31:07.144
Well, first off, I don't drink coffee.

01:31:07.562 --> 01:31:10.231
Now can I climb out?
I'm hungry for my supper.

01:31:10.649 --> 01:31:13.317
Where's your Creedmoor at, Robert Lee?

01:31:13.985 --> 01:31:16.779
Where's your cabbage-shooting
Mexican <i>pistola,</i>

01:31:16.822 --> 01:31:20.408
with flowers on the handle, Robert Lee?
Why don't you go get it?

01:31:22.369 --> 01:31:24.245
Well, that settles it.

01:31:24.996 --> 01:31:27.957
I'm not that hungry, and I'll stay here

01:31:27.999 --> 01:31:31.669
till someone fetches me
who cares about my welfare

01:31:31.795 --> 01:31:32.920
and deplores...

01:31:33.004 --> 01:31:35.715
Get up, you dry gulching
piece of floating slime.

01:31:37.592 --> 01:31:38.718
Get up!

01:31:42.139 --> 01:31:45.850
I want to lie here and lose.
No dinner. No nothing.

01:31:52.190 --> 01:31:53.357
Well?

01:32:19.426 --> 01:32:21.719
My God, you ain't even there!

01:32:48.413 --> 01:32:49.997
Did you kill him?

01:32:50.582 --> 01:32:52.708
No, I just emptied his tub.

01:32:52.751 --> 01:32:55.920
Somebody's gonna have to do something
about that.

01:33:15.607 --> 01:33:17.441
What's become of Tom?

01:33:19.361 --> 01:33:21.570
-Isn't he on his place?
-No, he's not.

01:33:22.447 --> 01:33:26.784
Well, that's not what I call ranching,
and I know what you're driving at.

01:33:26.827 --> 01:33:28.118
All I can tell you, my darling,

01:33:28.161 --> 01:33:31.247
is that things have been nearly as bad
as they could be around here.

01:33:31.289 --> 01:33:34.375
And if those two men have some reason
to be looking for one another,

01:33:34.459 --> 01:33:35.751
it's not my place to interfere.

01:33:35.794 --> 01:33:38.170
You find Lee Clayton and you stop him!

01:33:38.255 --> 01:33:39.672
No!

01:33:39.756 --> 01:33:41.340
You can't.

01:33:42.592 --> 01:33:43.801
I won't.

01:33:45.554 --> 01:33:47.972
I hope that you choke on that.

01:33:50.892 --> 01:33:52.977
You don't mean that, darling!

01:33:58.441 --> 01:34:02.403
I would never have hired Lee Clayton
if those rustlers hadn't killed Pete Marker.

01:34:02.487 --> 01:34:05.990
This has nothing to do with Pete, or law,
or stealing horses, and you know it.

01:34:06.032 --> 01:34:08.617
-Then what does it have to do with?
-Tom Logan.

01:34:08.660 --> 01:34:10.202
Tom Logan.

01:34:12.289 --> 01:34:13.998
Well, I never even think about him.

01:34:14.082 --> 01:34:17.167
You can't bear me being with him, can you?

01:34:17.210 --> 01:34:20.880
Now, Daddy, God damn it,
you find Lee Clayton and you stop him!

01:34:22.841 --> 01:34:25.801
You think I couldn't bear living here alone,
don't you?

01:34:25.844 --> 01:34:28.178
Stop Lee Clayton? No.

01:34:31.182 --> 01:34:33.475
No, I won't.

01:34:41.693 --> 01:34:43.360
What the hell are you doing?

01:34:43.403 --> 01:34:45.613
Cal's got me looking out for Lee Clayton.

01:34:45.697 --> 01:34:48.198
Come on down. Old Buck come up lame.

01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:51.493
-Give me a hand, God damn it.
-Easy, Buck.

01:34:51.912 --> 01:34:53.579
Come on, now.

01:34:54.039 --> 01:34:56.832
The only God damn intelligent horse...

01:34:56.875 --> 01:34:58.042
Easy, boy.

01:34:59.586 --> 01:35:00.961
I had him.

01:35:07.260 --> 01:35:10.471
You think anybody could do it? I mean...

01:35:12.015 --> 01:35:13.682
An ordinary fellow?

01:35:16.895 --> 01:35:18.354
I don't know.

01:35:21.024 --> 01:35:24.735
It seemed like somebody
ought to be able to get the job done.

01:35:26.404 --> 01:35:28.280
Just watch it, is all.

01:35:31.576 --> 01:35:33.869
I'll tell you one thing, though...

01:35:35.538 --> 01:35:37.623
Don't start talking to him.

01:35:37.707 --> 01:35:41.335
I don't care what the plan is,
as long as you get us the hell out of here.

01:35:41.419 --> 01:35:45.214
Yeah, that's what I'd like.
Let's just pull our socks up and get out.

01:35:45.924 --> 01:35:47.591
We're gonna hit Braxton.

01:35:48.969 --> 01:35:53.097
We're gonna take everything he's got.
Blooded stock and all.

01:35:53.139 --> 01:35:55.099
I think that's the least we can do.

01:35:55.141 --> 01:35:57.184
And maybe flush us a regulator.

01:35:57.268 --> 01:36:00.020
Yeah, well, I would love to include
the old man.

01:36:00.105 --> 01:36:03.107
A .44 .40 in the brainpan
would be my sentence for him.

01:36:03.149 --> 01:36:06.151
Now I don't know why you don't want
to go along with that, Tom.

01:36:06.236 --> 01:36:07.736
I'd just as soon we didn't, Cal.

01:36:07.779 --> 01:36:11.281
I want to know on what grounds you don't
wanna shoot Braxton like he deserves?

01:36:11.366 --> 01:36:14.868
We ain't gonna do it because
I said we ain't gonna do it!

01:36:16.913 --> 01:36:19.373
Now, am I perfectly clear on that, Cal?

01:36:19.457 --> 01:36:21.709
God damn it, let's not start that stuff.

01:36:21.793 --> 01:36:22.960
Yeah, really.

01:36:23.003 --> 01:36:25.671
Tom, it's only gonna wreck the whole job.

01:36:25.755 --> 01:36:26.797
Cal.

01:36:40.645 --> 01:36:43.897
Hey, Woodruff,
Braxton's got you nighthawking.

01:36:44.482 --> 01:36:47.151
Hey, Mr. Logan, what you doing
out of bed at this hour?

01:36:47.193 --> 01:36:49.611
Looking for a better life, Woodruff.

01:36:49.654 --> 01:36:51.655
What do you know that's new and exciting?

01:36:51.740 --> 01:36:53.073
Same old thing.

01:36:53.658 --> 01:36:55.409
What have you got in here?

01:36:58.371 --> 01:37:01.540
.37. And I got the horse bit.

01:37:03.752 --> 01:37:05.210
You're gonna take them?

01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:09.840
You bet. Want to get down now

01:37:11.843 --> 01:37:15.596
and reach me over that bird's head Colt
you got stuck in your shirt there.

01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:17.931
Butt first, if you please, Woodruff.

01:37:37.535 --> 01:37:39.870
You think you're smart, don't you?

01:37:40.038 --> 01:37:41.955
Yeah, well, I ain't dumb, and I ain't tied up.

01:37:44.209 --> 01:37:46.585
You just lay on that soft spot.

01:37:46.669 --> 01:37:49.004
Tom, you're slicker
than snot on a doorknob.

01:37:49.047 --> 01:37:50.881
Why, thank you, Cary.

01:37:55.303 --> 01:37:57.387
I'll tell you one God damn thing,

01:37:57.472 --> 01:38:01.558
old Braxton's gonna be one surprised-ass
son of a bitch, ain't he?

01:38:04.938 --> 01:38:08.607
You know, I regret Pete Marker
wasn't here to get the news,

01:38:08.691 --> 01:38:10.400
that sorry bag of shit.

01:38:10.485 --> 01:38:14.571
We'll see him in hell, that son of a bitch,
if he don't turn out to be the Devil himself.

01:38:14.656 --> 01:38:16.698
Shut up, Si, you're gonna put
these damn horses

01:38:16.741 --> 01:38:18.575
all the way down to Kansas without us!

01:38:18.910 --> 01:38:22.079
Let's push, boys. I feel eyes all over us.

01:38:43.434 --> 01:38:45.394
That relay ranch is dead.

01:38:45.895 --> 01:38:48.772
-Anybody got a preferred district?
-Hells Gate for me.

01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:52.776
Big Hole? I'll meet you there. Cal?

01:38:53.987 --> 01:38:56.613
I suppose. Shit, that's all that's left.

01:38:56.698 --> 01:38:59.283
All right, we'll meet back at the old cabin.
Cary?

01:38:59.367 --> 01:39:00.367
Yeah, all right.

01:39:00.451 --> 01:39:04.454
Remember, I want to get $20 dollars a head
for these, or we'll be doing this job...

01:39:18.887 --> 01:39:21.638
Well, I could have picked off
one or two of them, maybe

01:39:21.681 --> 01:39:23.557
but we'd have lost the rest for sure.

01:39:23.641 --> 01:39:27.352
Well, now, supposing you had a barn
full of nasty old bats

01:39:27.437 --> 01:39:29.313
and you wanted to get rid of them.

01:39:29.439 --> 01:39:31.648
Well, the worst thing you could do
is just get your gun

01:39:31.733 --> 01:39:34.526
and just start shooting and banging around

01:39:34.611 --> 01:39:37.446
and what good would it do you?
It wouldn't do a damn bit of good.

01:39:37.488 --> 01:39:40.157
They'd all leave and then they'd be back
by 7:30 in the morning.

01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:42.576
Now, if you want to get rid of
a whole lot of evil bats,

01:39:42.660 --> 01:39:44.494
there's only one way.

01:39:44.579 --> 01:39:46.163
And the way is this...

01:39:46.331 --> 01:39:48.040
You wait till the dawn comes.

01:39:48.625 --> 01:39:51.668
About 4:30, and you're waiting outside
by the barrels there.

01:39:52.253 --> 01:39:56.673
And then, you close the door real quick
and all of the bats are inside

01:39:57.258 --> 01:40:00.677
and then while they're sleeping,
the lovely little sweethearts,

01:40:00.762 --> 01:40:04.223
you have every one
of the dirty little buggers at your mercy.

01:40:04.307 --> 01:40:05.724
And that's the only way you can do it.

01:40:06.351 --> 01:40:08.810
Well, that's all very informative.

01:40:09.229 --> 01:40:11.355
But every horse I own is gone.

01:40:12.023 --> 01:40:15.817
And the only way you're gonna get paid
is if I get them back.

01:40:18.279 --> 01:40:20.614
I don't care a damn about that.

01:40:21.115 --> 01:40:23.075
I always finish the work.

01:40:24.869 --> 01:40:27.746
And I don't give a damn whether or not
I get paid.

01:40:28.623 --> 01:40:32.125
And talking about horses,

01:40:32.210 --> 01:40:34.461
I think I know the horse
that you're worrying about.

01:40:34.712 --> 01:40:37.422
-He wears a black hat, he's two legged...
-Shut up!

01:40:37.507 --> 01:40:40.050
And I think I know where he stands at stud.

01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:42.928
Shut up! You're out of control,
you're through!

01:40:43.012 --> 01:40:45.097
I want you off the place. Now, git!

01:40:46.057 --> 01:40:48.225
Well, it is your place, sir.

01:40:48.434 --> 01:40:51.895
But the work is mine
and I'll have the say about that.

01:40:54.565 --> 01:40:57.067
Come on now, Jess,
we know when we're not wanted.

01:40:57.443 --> 01:40:59.820
Let's go out to the manhunt now.

01:41:00.571 --> 01:41:03.073
You lazy no-good bastards,
get back to work

01:41:03.116 --> 01:41:04.783
or I'll fire every damn one of you.

01:41:23.970 --> 01:41:26.430
They call this country Hells Gate.

01:41:28.933 --> 01:41:32.644
When my dad came in here it was nothing
but a bunch of savage Indians...

01:41:34.147 --> 01:41:35.188
And Jesuits.

01:41:38.401 --> 01:41:41.445
Old Thomas Jefferson said
that he was a warrior

01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:44.406
so his son could be a farmer,

01:41:44.449 --> 01:41:46.867
so his son could be a poet.

01:41:50.621 --> 01:41:53.457
And I raise cattle
so my son can be a merchant,

01:41:54.917 --> 01:41:58.211
so his son can move to Newport,
Rhode Island and buy a sailboat

01:41:58.296 --> 01:42:01.965
and never see one of these bastard-ass
son of a bitching mountains again.

01:42:07.305 --> 01:42:09.306
Who was Thomas Jefferson?

01:42:12.894 --> 01:42:14.478
A guy back East.

01:42:19.067 --> 01:42:21.735
I'll bet you're about done in.
You had a long day.

01:42:21.819 --> 01:42:22.986
That's true.

01:42:24.155 --> 01:42:26.865
Mother, you want to show our boy
the bunkhouse?

01:42:26.949 --> 01:42:28.158
Surely.

01:42:29.369 --> 01:42:31.244
I'll bring him a blanket.

01:42:32.622 --> 01:42:35.165
I'll see you before you start out
in the morning.

01:42:35.249 --> 01:42:36.541
Fine.

01:42:37.543 --> 01:42:40.712
And let me thank you again
for selling me those horses.

01:42:40.797 --> 01:42:42.464
It's my pleasure.

01:42:43.841 --> 01:42:47.219
And my compliments to the artist
who changed those brands.

01:42:47.595 --> 01:42:48.970
Was it you?

01:42:51.432 --> 01:42:55.519
I learned it from a nice boy from Newport,
Rhode Island with no sailboat.

01:42:56.020 --> 01:42:59.314
They hung him in a cottonwood,
south of the Shonkin Sag by the neck,

01:42:59.357 --> 01:43:01.441
until dead, that would be.

01:43:12.745 --> 01:43:14.704
You've got five minutes.

01:43:16.874 --> 01:43:19.793
Wait, it would help

01:43:20.169 --> 01:43:23.130
-if you got out of your drawers altogether.
-No!

01:43:24.257 --> 01:43:26.466
What good is it keeping them on one leg?

01:43:26.551 --> 01:43:28.552
Why don't you shut up?

01:43:29.887 --> 01:43:32.389
You've only got four of your minutes left.

01:43:36.227 --> 01:43:38.603
And besides, I'm beginning to chafe.

01:43:48.573 --> 01:43:49.906
Honey.

01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:29.905
Kid. Here.

01:44:29.947 --> 01:44:32.616
Here's a buck. Go get me a whiskey,
and the rest is yours.

01:44:32.700 --> 01:44:34.826
Good stuff. Go on, hurry up.

01:44:45.671 --> 01:44:46.880
Thanks.

01:45:12.657 --> 01:45:14.366
Hold these, Junior.

01:45:16.661 --> 01:45:20.163
I won't be but a minute,
then we'll go get us something to eat.

01:46:04.041 --> 01:46:06.543
I ain't got but $54 dollars, mister.

01:46:06.877 --> 01:46:09.629
But I want all three horses. Or nothing.

01:46:11.924 --> 01:46:13.383
What have you got to trade?

01:46:16.053 --> 01:46:17.137
A clarinet.

01:46:24.395 --> 01:46:32.395
All right, I'll take it.

01:47:46.811 --> 01:47:48.395
I can't use it.

01:47:54.652 --> 01:47:56.528
Here, let me try it on.

01:47:59.490 --> 01:48:02.826
Put your arm in. You can't tell till it's on.

01:48:03.953 --> 01:48:07.664
-It fits perfect...
-I don't want the God damn thing.

01:49:13.022 --> 01:49:14.397
Smoked meat.

01:49:34.210 --> 01:49:35.835
Old smoked meat.

01:49:44.178 --> 01:49:45.804
Where's Tom Logan?

01:49:54.814 --> 01:49:57.148
I couldn't get him to come out.

01:49:58.192 --> 01:49:59.442
God.

01:50:03.989 --> 01:50:05.573
Too proud, huh?

01:50:07.576 --> 01:50:08.827
I reckon.

01:50:19.797 --> 01:50:23.424
I'd like about anything but getting burnt up.

01:50:39.358 --> 01:50:42.360
Well, you're about the last of your kind,
old man.

01:50:44.113 --> 01:50:47.407
If I was a better businessman
than I am a man hunter,

01:50:47.491 --> 01:50:49.325
I'd put you in the circus.

01:51:00.129 --> 01:51:03.339
You know, about this time of year,
Indian summer,

01:51:03.424 --> 01:51:04.966
it's getting there,

01:51:05.509 --> 01:51:08.136
they say you can see
the Star of Bethlehem,

01:51:09.013 --> 01:51:10.680
if you look real good.

01:51:11.515 --> 01:51:13.433
I seen it once or twice.

01:51:15.436 --> 01:51:18.646
But you gotta look away
and then you gotta look at it, see,

01:51:18.731 --> 01:51:21.107
and you gotta look just a minute like that.

01:51:23.861 --> 01:51:25.361
See what I mean?

01:51:51.347 --> 01:51:54.307
Well, old Granny's getting tired now.

01:53:02.126 --> 01:53:03.292
Cal?

01:53:09.216 --> 01:53:10.299
Si?

01:53:30.821 --> 01:53:32.155
Oh, my God.

01:54:30.130 --> 01:54:34.050
No, kiss first.

01:54:40.474 --> 01:54:42.558
You've the lips of Salome

01:54:43.268 --> 01:54:45.269
and the eyes of Cleopatra.

01:54:58.408 --> 01:55:03.246
I dedicate this song
to the only woman I ever loved.

01:55:06.917 --> 01:55:10.169
I'm too shy to turn around
and say it to your face.

01:55:10.963 --> 01:55:13.089
But I mean it from my heart.

01:55:14.216 --> 01:55:16.551
I don't love you, you harlot.

01:55:16.593 --> 01:55:19.428
I'm not even speaking to you.
Do you know that?

01:55:23.517 --> 01:55:26.644
Come on. Would you?

01:55:28.605 --> 01:55:32.441
That for you,
and your disloyalty and your treachery.

01:55:34.945 --> 01:55:36.279
Dear heart.

01:55:58.427 --> 01:56:00.887
Say good night to Granny.

01:56:02.139 --> 01:56:03.764
I'll play you a tune.

01:56:21.992 --> 01:56:24.952
Well, that's a fine thing.

01:56:25.537 --> 01:56:28.623
You pissed
right in the middle of my love song.

01:56:31.376 --> 01:56:33.794
God, pissing on my song.

01:56:52.648 --> 01:56:53.773
Well.

01:57:24.596 --> 01:57:26.055
You know what woke you up?

01:57:29.518 --> 01:57:31.560
Lee, you just had your throat cut.

01:58:11.977 --> 01:58:12.977
Where is he?

01:58:32.664 --> 01:58:34.248
He's in there.

01:58:48.513 --> 01:58:51.432
All the rest of the hands left
a couple days ago except for Vern here.

01:58:52.642 --> 01:58:55.895
-I'm staying. You betcha.
-It's all right, Vern.

01:59:00.484 --> 01:59:02.443
I told him I was leaving last night

01:59:03.278 --> 01:59:05.529
and he sort of came unraveled.

01:59:07.199 --> 01:59:08.616
He's just lost himself.

01:59:12.037 --> 01:59:15.498
Well, all I can say is
he'd better leave the room

01:59:15.540 --> 01:59:17.500
'cause I'm gonna do it regardless.

01:59:18.502 --> 01:59:19.794
-Get out of the way, Vern.
-No.

01:59:19.836 --> 01:59:21.337
You recognize this?

01:59:23.173 --> 01:59:26.509
-You recognize it?
-No.

01:59:27.177 --> 01:59:29.929
Please don't shoot him.

01:59:30.013 --> 01:59:32.681
What the hell
are you caterwauling about, Vern?

01:59:32.766 --> 01:59:35.017
Get out of the way, Vern,
before I put one into you!

01:59:35.102 --> 01:59:37.520
You might as well. He's all I got. No.

01:59:39.481 --> 01:59:42.108
Just go ahead, he's all I have.

01:59:43.026 --> 01:59:44.902
Yes, sir. Shoot me.

01:59:47.114 --> 01:59:48.697
Shoot me, yes, shoot me!

01:59:52.786 --> 01:59:55.413
Get out of here!
Get that son of a bitch away!

01:59:55.497 --> 01:59:58.416
-Vern, will you get away?
-I will. You betcha.

02:00:01.670 --> 02:00:03.796
-I'm sorry, Tom!
-What for?

02:00:04.840 --> 02:00:06.382
For everything.

02:00:10.220 --> 02:00:11.554
Your friends, are they...

02:00:15.350 --> 02:00:16.350
Yeah.

02:00:29.906 --> 02:00:33.742
-What were you gonna do, just take off?
-Yes.

02:00:36.788 --> 02:00:37.830
What did you expect?

02:00:40.041 --> 02:00:41.292
To see you, for one thing.

02:00:46.673 --> 02:00:49.758
-Did you think I'd be above ground?
-Well, of course.

02:00:49.843 --> 02:00:50.843
Why of course?

02:00:50.927 --> 02:00:53.512
Because I just can't imagine you dead.

02:00:55.474 --> 02:00:58.225
My God, are you gonna make me say it?

02:01:01.897 --> 02:01:02.938
Tom!

02:02:08.421 --> 02:02:10.506
You just about done it?

02:02:11.967 --> 02:02:13.342
Just about.

02:02:16.638 --> 02:02:19.306
Well, I think I found a buyer for the ranch.

02:02:20.016 --> 02:02:22.685
I'm going into Absaroka
now to see about it,

02:02:23.186 --> 02:02:24.853
and find a place for Vern.

02:02:30.277 --> 02:02:31.277
I'm glad.

02:02:34.447 --> 02:02:36.407
You know, I don't want to spend
the rest of my life

02:02:36.491 --> 02:02:38.367
trying to get back at somebody.

02:02:40.745 --> 02:02:42.204
Why'd you say that?

02:02:44.332 --> 02:02:46.000
No reason.

02:02:52.882 --> 02:02:55.509
Why, hell, neither do I.

02:03:01.099 --> 02:03:02.725
But where do you think you'll be

02:03:04.185 --> 02:03:07.021
in about six months?

02:03:09.065 --> 02:03:12.026
Well, if I was to guess, I'd say

02:03:12.485 --> 02:03:14.028
north of the Breaks,

02:03:14.946 --> 02:03:17.364
there's the little Rockies up there,

02:03:17.407 --> 02:03:20.242
and a lot of little valleys
are supposed to have water year around.

02:03:24.581 --> 02:03:32.581
Sounds like a real good guess.
