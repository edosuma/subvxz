WEBVTT

01:59.245 --> 02:02.988
"My dear friend Gaius,

02:04.333 --> 02:08.997
"how we come to this absurd position?

02:10.006 --> 02:16.423
"In the interests of peace and equity,
Iacceptu”

02:16.554 --> 02:22.140
"The Senate and People of Rome
have authorised me to accept."

02:22.268 --> 02:27.228
"..the Senate and People of Rome
have authorised me to accept a truce..."

02:27.356 --> 02:31.565
Not truce. That would imply he is
a sovereign rather than a criminal entity.

02:31.694 --> 02:34.686
Quite right. A criminal.

02:34.822 --> 02:41.113
"..have authorised me
to accept a cessation of hostilities

02:41.245 --> 02:45.989
"on the terms offered in your last letter.

02:46.125 --> 02:48.081
"I await your answer."

02:48.210 --> 02:49.791
Good enough.

02:49.920 --> 02:53.253
This abject humiliation is good enough?

02:53.382 --> 02:56.089
We're not men. We're worms.

02:56.218 --> 02:58.083
Worms is harsh.

02:58.220 --> 03:01.804
Worms cannot run away as speedily as we do.

03:01.932 --> 03:06.221
Caesar has not even left Rome,
the gods know why not,

03:06.354 --> 03:12.099
yet his legions chase us
from town to town with great ease.

03:12.234 --> 03:14.896
We're more like sheep than worms.

03:15.029 --> 03:18.066
If our levies had not failed,
if we had money to pay troops.

03:18.199 --> 03:22.067
- But they have and we don't.
— Let us cleave to the matter at hand.

03:22.203 --> 03:25.991
You must give some notion
of when you will agree to meet him.

03:26.123 --> 03:28.500
— Never.
— There is no reason for them to meet.

03:28.626 --> 03:32.289
— The dispute is Caesar and the Senate's.
— It is the proper form.

03:32.421 --> 03:34.207
I'll not meet the man. Never.

03:34.340 --> 03:38.925
Like a son, he was to me.
— What he was like to you is immaterial.

03:39.053 --> 03:43.797
It is only by Jupiter's mercy that he has not
already put our heads on pikes.

03:43.933 --> 03:47.141
Jupiter has no mercy for cowards.

03:47.269 --> 03:50.636
— Cato, be careful.
— You'll accept abject surrender...

03:50.773 --> 03:52.855
This is not surrender!

03:54.485 --> 03:56.771
Pompey Magnus does not surrender.

04:01.242 --> 04:03.198
I need time.

04:03.327 --> 04:06.114
A truce gains us that time.

04:28.227 --> 04:31.185
He entrusts his living to your abundant mercy.

04:31.313 --> 04:34.020
- Horta?
— Pederast. Waxy skin. Red hair.

04:34.150 --> 04:37.108
- Estates in Tusculum.
— l have him, the wretch.

04:37.236 --> 04:41.775
Send a small bag of money with a fulsome
letter and make him a quaestor or something.

04:41.907 --> 04:45.820
Show mercy to every man that deserts
Pompey, you will pauperise yourself.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.739
There's dozens coming every day.

04:47.872 --> 04:50.909
Judicious use of mercy is worth 10,000 men

04:51.041 --> 04:54.374
and if my last coin buys me a throne,
it's a fair price.

04:54.503 --> 04:57.085
— Throne?
— Poetic licence. What else?

04:57.214 --> 04:59.045
Atia invites you to dinner tonight.

04:59.175 --> 05:01.257
Again?

05:03.179 --> 05:04.544
Not tonight, in any case.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.295
— What excuse?
— None.

05:06.432 --> 05:11.768
— It's the second time you've refused her.
- I need not account for myself to Atia.

05:11.896 --> 05:16.139
As you say.
Not a sapient choice perhaps but brave, sure.

05:16.275 --> 05:19.483
They say slaves talk of bravery
as fish talk of flying.

05:19.612 --> 05:22.228
They say that, do they?
How very witty of them.

05:24.033 --> 05:26.740
"Seeking onlyjustice and peace

05:26.869 --> 05:30.737
"and to avoid the unnecessary
shedding of Roman blood,

05:30.873 --> 05:35.082
"Gaius Julius Caesar has publicly implored

05:35.211 --> 05:41.127
"the renegade Gnaeus Pompey Magnus
to accept truce and lay down his arms."

05:44.053 --> 05:46.294
What are you doing?

05:46.430 --> 05:48.762
It's rather fun and there's quite an art to it.

05:48.891 --> 05:50.381
Strange boy.

05:52.978 --> 05:56.436
I've just heard a strange tale
about you from the kitchen staff.

05:56.565 --> 06:00.183
For what reason would you and Caesar
be skulking about in a cupboard?

06:00.319 --> 06:03.811
What? It was nothing.

06:03.948 --> 06:06.155
It doesn't sound like nothing.

06:06.283 --> 06:09.775
— You seduced him, you sly little fox.
- I did not.

06:09.912 --> 06:14.622
I'm not clear it is decent, him being your
great—uncle, but who's to say what's decent?

06:14.750 --> 06:21.542
In any case, well done. Let's see Servilia
compete with a soft young boy like you.

06:21.674 --> 06:24.507
— What power we shall wield.
- You have it wrong.

06:24.635 --> 06:26.796
A good lover is a discreet lover.

06:26.929 --> 06:29.545
He was taken ill. I was helping him to recover.

06:29.682 --> 06:32.890
Of course he was. Now, in future
you must not appear too eager.

06:33.018 --> 06:36.010
— A man likes it if you play hard to get.
— Leave him alone.

06:36.146 --> 06:39.354
Now, I've invited Caesar
and Mark Antony for dinner tonight.

06:39.483 --> 06:43.351
— Be sure you look especially...
- I am not his lover!

06:43.487 --> 06:46.979
— Do not lie to me. You know I detest it.
— I am not lying.

06:47.116 --> 06:49.323
He has a terrible affliction.

06:49.451 --> 06:51.612
What affliction? By whom?

06:53.455 --> 06:57.073
— I will speak no more of it. I swore an oath.
— I am your mother. Tell me.

06:57.209 --> 06:59.700
Excuse me. I will not.

07:04.758 --> 07:07.215
That's very disappointing.

07:13.392 --> 07:16.350
Caesar sends to say
he cannot come this evening.

07:16.478 --> 07:18.309
No matter.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.810
- Why not?
— He doesn't say.

07:42.338 --> 07:45.000
Titus Pullo is sleeping on the stairs again.

07:45.132 --> 07:48.795
- Has he nowhere else to go?
— He won't be in Rome much longer.

07:48.927 --> 07:53.387
Tell me, when is the youth returning?
Your husband.

07:53.515 --> 07:56.507
— Crito.
— When does he return from his droving?

07:56.644 --> 07:59.181
— November. Why?
— I'm selling my slaves today.

07:59.313 --> 08:01.269
There'll be money for your dowry.

08:01.398 --> 08:05.437
So when Crito comes home, you and Lucius
can go to him and start married life.

08:05.569 --> 08:08.402
- Thank you, Father!
— We'll be sorry to see you go.

08:08.530 --> 08:10.236
November? It's so soon.

08:10.366 --> 08:13.199
— They have to go at some time.
- Of course but November.

08:13.327 --> 08:14.908
It's hard but it has to be done.

08:15.037 --> 08:17.824
They'll be so far away.
You know how drovers live.

08:17.956 --> 08:21.039
But, Mama, lwant to go.
I want to be with my husband.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.250
I know. Of course. You must go.

08:23.379 --> 08:25.870
It's just hard.

08:28.342 --> 08:30.173
Morning.

08:31.095 --> 08:34.758
— Trouble you for some water?
- Sit down.

08:36.100 --> 08:39.012
— You should be in camp.
- Nothing to do there.

08:39.144 --> 08:42.352
— lt's boring.
— Take some bread.

08:42.481 --> 08:46.520
I'll not, thanks. I'm not feeling too well.

08:46.652 --> 08:49.064
You're drinking too much.

08:49.988 --> 08:52.365
It's not that.

08:52.491 --> 08:55.073
I ate some depraved oysters.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.739
Where's your girl?

09:01.125 --> 09:02.990
Cack...

09:08.424 --> 09:11.962
— I know it's one of these.
— Stop worrying.

09:12.094 --> 09:14.756
Even if we can't find her, you can get another.

09:15.764 --> 09:18.301
I don't want another. I want Eirene.

09:18.434 --> 09:21.972
You'll be off south after Pompey.
You can't take her soldiering.

09:22.104 --> 09:25.767
Maybe I won't go back to camp.
My time is nearly done anyway.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.185
Leave the 13th? Why?

09:29.945 --> 09:33.608
— You did.
— You are not me. You've no talent for peace.

09:33.741 --> 09:36.107
I can't just leave her.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.905
— You think with your penis.
— It's not like that.

09:39.037 --> 09:41.323
— I've not touched her.
— What's her purpose?

09:41.457 --> 09:45.291
ljust like to look at her. It makes me calm.

09:49.298 --> 09:53.462
Here she is. Thank you, Apollo.

09:54.845 --> 09:56.881
The girl is his.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.848
No trouble. Pay what's owed
and the girl is all yours.

10:01.977 --> 10:06.095
What's owed? You should be paying me
to drink the pond filth you serve here.

10:11.820 --> 10:14.027
How much?

10:16.366 --> 10:18.573
I'll pay you back, soon as I can.

10:18.702 --> 10:20.738
Do that.

10:20.871 --> 10:22.953
So what will you do with her?

10:29.254 --> 10:31.165
— I don't want her.
- Say again?

10:31.298 --> 10:33.084
It's nice of you to think of it...

10:33.217 --> 10:36.459
But you want a slave.
You keep asking for one and here she is.

10:36.595 --> 10:39.632
— Pullo can't keep her.
— Can't I have a Gaulish slave?

10:39.765 --> 10:42.882
My Gauls would cut your throat
as soon as sweep your floor.

10:43.018 --> 10:46.852
This one's trained up nice and docile.
What is wrong with her?

10:49.733 --> 10:52.691
— She has strange eyes.
- You drive me insane!

10:54.238 --> 10:56.229
The girl stays.

11:04.331 --> 11:07.289
Keep calm, sweetie.

11:07.417 --> 11:10.909
How can I be calm when Pullo's
put that little witch to spy on me?

11:11.046 --> 11:14.538
— He knows, Rissa, he knows.
— Big simple brute like that?

11:14.675 --> 11:18.338
If he suspected anything,
he'd go straight to Vorenus and tell him.

11:18.470 --> 11:20.677
— Course he would.
— Do you really think?

11:20.806 --> 11:23.343
— He doesn't know nothing.
- Really?

11:23.475 --> 11:26.763
Sure of it. So he saw
Evander round your house.

11:26.895 --> 11:29.102
So what? He's family. He's allowed.

11:29.940 --> 11:33.228
- That's true.
— You're getting worried over nothing.

11:34.069 --> 11:35.775
Gods, let it be so.

11:36.238 --> 11:38.900
Poor sad wretch gives
everything you asked for.

11:39.533 --> 11:43.947
The Senate will ratify your status,
you get your triumph, stand for consul

11:44.079 --> 11:46.695
and Pompey shall withdraw to Spain.

11:46.832 --> 11:49.448
He'll suck Posca's cock if asked nicely.

11:49.585 --> 11:53.669
Too generous by far. I never thought
Pompey would accept such terms.

11:53.797 --> 11:56.584
— You think it's a stratagem?
- I doubt it.

11:57.759 --> 12:00.011
He and what few forces he has are trapped.

12:00.137 --> 12:02.970
He's weak and growing weaker every day.

12:03.098 --> 12:05.305
We might crush him at will.

12:05.434 --> 12:08.016
But now that he has offered truce,

12:08.145 --> 12:11.933
I will look like the worst kind of tyrant
if I attack him.

12:12.065 --> 12:16.980
Posca here thinks I should accept truce.
Make peace.

12:17.112 --> 12:20.024
— In exchange for what?
— Peace is its own reward.

12:20.157 --> 12:21.943
Snivelry.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.452
The ram has touched the wall. No mercy.

12:24.578 --> 12:27.445
Pompey has no great army
but he has the Senate with him.

12:27.581 --> 12:30.914
— He has legitimacy.
— In Rome they are the Senate.

12:31.043 --> 12:33.409
Beyond the walls they are just 300 old men.

12:33.545 --> 12:36.002
As you say, but others will agree with Posca.

12:36.131 --> 12:40.170
They have made this shameful surrender
public. It will be read all over ltaly.

12:40.302 --> 12:44.671
If I am not a tyrant, if I merely seek legitimacy,

12:44.806 --> 12:47.297
why would I not accept such favourable terms?

12:48.936 --> 12:52.178
He refuses to meet us...

12:53.231 --> 12:55.313
in person?

12:59.071 --> 13:03.690
Very good. Simple.
Hoi polloi can understand a reason like that.

13:03.825 --> 13:07.818
He refuses to meet me
face—to—face, man—to—man.

13:09.331 --> 13:11.788
He refuses to meet me!

13:11.917 --> 13:16.581
Right, that's it. No truce. Let's be after them.

13:16.713 --> 13:18.544
Paﬂence.

13:19.508 --> 13:21.590
He's well caught.

13:22.678 --> 13:24.919
We'll leave when the time is right.

13:28.517 --> 13:30.724
VVhen?

13:30.852 --> 13:32.808
When the time is right.

13:32.938 --> 13:35.145
But we should have left Rome long ago.

13:35.273 --> 13:39.516
The apple is ripe for the plucking
and we just sit here doing nothing?

13:41.363 --> 13:46.198
Pompey is not an apple...
and I am not a farmer.

13:47.244 --> 13:49.360
Call for my guard.

13:57.796 --> 13:59.582
Come on!

13:59.715 --> 14:03.048
He's worth more than that, look at him!
Look at the arms on him.

14:03.176 --> 14:08.591
Come on! 40, 50.
Thank you very much. Any advance on 50?

14:08.724 --> 14:12.933
First Spear Centurion Lucius Vorenus.
I've been looking for your return.

14:13.061 --> 14:16.394
I'm no longer in the army, citizen.
I've come to sell my stock.

14:38.420 --> 14:42.254
Black blood flux. Nothing to be done.

14:43.425 --> 14:47.634
I kept 'em here despite the stink
so you'd know I'd done you nothing dodgy.

14:47.763 --> 14:49.674
Nobody to blame.

14:49.806 --> 14:52.388
Fortune left you one, at least.

14:52.517 --> 14:57.136
— Auspicious boy, that is.
— How much will he fetch?

14:57.272 --> 14:59.888
A respectable price.

15:00.025 --> 15:02.812
More than enough to pay the feed bill.

15:02.944 --> 15:05.401
— Feed bi||?
— They didn't starve to death.

15:12.704 --> 15:14.569
Move!

15:23.298 --> 15:26.665
- Nothing?
— He'll fetch a good price when he's healthy.

15:26.802 --> 15:29.669
- What's that?
— Your father brought him back. Till then?

15:29.805 --> 15:32.672
— To keep?
— We sell him when he gets some colour.

15:32.808 --> 15:34.844
— What will we do then?
— What's his name?

15:34.976 --> 15:38.685
- He hasn't got one!
— We'll call him Rubio after my pigeon that died.

15:38.814 --> 15:42.682
- We've nothing saved.
— Don't worry. I will think of something.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.098
— And again.
— This is a rout.

16:19.020 --> 16:21.477
Shall I be merciful?

16:26.695 --> 16:28.811
I think not.

16:35.954 --> 16:38.036
How will you pay your debt?

16:42.502 --> 16:47.087
All that l have is already yours.
What else can I give you?

16:47.215 --> 16:49.080
Don't leave me again.

16:49.926 --> 16:52.383
I never left you.

17:14.868 --> 17:17.450
The men are going mad from boredom.

17:17.579 --> 17:23.119
Today I had to cut the hands off a perfectly
good legionary for murdering a civilian.

17:23.251 --> 17:30.464
Then I had to listen
to a jumped—up freedman raving for hours

17:30.592 --> 17:35.052
about one of my centurions
seducing his daughters.

17:35.180 --> 17:39.344
— It all sounds very tedious.
— It is your uncle's fault.

17:39.476 --> 17:42.639
He should've taken
the legions south after Pompey.

17:42.771 --> 17:46.514
The men know it and it makes them restless.

17:49.069 --> 17:50.934
Of course...

17:53.573 --> 17:55.985
he pretends it is a stratagem.

17:59.079 --> 18:04.119
But every dog in camp knows
that Servilia has unmanned him.

18:05.168 --> 18:07.625
He will not be parted from her.

18:09.631 --> 18:13.749
l, as you can tell...

18:15.095 --> 18:17.507
am not unmanned.

18:33.989 --> 18:36.196
Intolerable. Intolerable!

18:36.324 --> 18:38.701
Calm yourself. You've become unbalanced.

18:38.827 --> 18:41.489
Why care so much who he beds? It is trivium.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.998
You take after your father...simple as milk.

18:44.124 --> 18:48.208
If he were not mewling in bed with that witch,
he would be chasing down Pompey.

18:48.336 --> 18:51.078
It is not trivium. The Republic is at stake.

18:51.214 --> 18:53.546
Since when do you care about the Republic?

18:53.675 --> 18:55.461
I care deeply about the Republic.

18:55.593 --> 18:58.801
It would be very unwise
to cause trouble about this.

18:58.930 --> 19:01.842
Of course. I wouldn't lower myself.

19:04.144 --> 19:08.353
Such sordid couplings have
a way of turning out badly anyhow,

19:08.481 --> 19:10.517
by no one's special doing.

19:11.401 --> 19:14.017
— Tutor has arrived.
— Good!

19:16.156 --> 19:19.444
Your tutor has arrived
and waits in the rear yard.

19:19.576 --> 19:20.907
What tutor?

19:21.036 --> 19:23.903
It's high time you learned the masculine arts.

19:24.039 --> 19:28.783
— How to fight and copulate and skin animals.
- There's plenty of time yet for all that.

19:28.918 --> 19:32.786
There's plenty of time for you to bury yourself
in worthless scribbles.

19:32.922 --> 19:37.131
Read those old Greek fools until blood
runs from your eyes — you'll be no wiser.

19:37.260 --> 19:40.468
I cannot agree. The Greek philosophers
have much to teach us.

19:40.597 --> 19:43.054
Well, here's a Greek philosopher for you.

19:44.893 --> 19:47.259
I've engaged that soldier of yours.

19:47.395 --> 19:49.886
- Vorenus?
— Was that it?

19:50.023 --> 19:52.560
Not the sullen Catonian one, I don't like him.

19:52.692 --> 19:55.684
— The cheerful brutish one.
- Pullo.

19:55.820 --> 19:59.278
That's it. What extraordinary
names these plebs have.

20:01.785 --> 20:05.027
Defend! Shield.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.207
Don't wave it about.

20:10.585 --> 20:12.496
Shield.

20:12.629 --> 20:14.745
Enough!

20:17.884 --> 20:19.920
Water.

20:31.147 --> 20:35.390
This is absurd. I have no soldiery stuff in me.

20:35.527 --> 20:37.643
And this exertion brings on a fever.

20:37.779 --> 20:40.612
— I feel it in my spleen.
— You're just not used to it.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.197
It takes time. I've seen you kill.

20:44.452 --> 20:46.829
— There's soldier in you.
— It's not killing.

20:46.955 --> 20:49.367
It's the waving about of swords I find tedious.

20:49.499 --> 20:52.536
I can kill people,
as long as they don't fight back.

20:52.669 --> 20:57.504
— We'll make a regular terror of you.
— At best I will be a middling swordsman.

20:59.676 --> 21:02.042
Graveyards are full of middling swordsmen.

21:02.178 --> 21:05.511
Best to be no swordsman at all
than a middling swordsman.

21:07.642 --> 21:10.224
Don't do that.

21:10.353 --> 21:12.435
Excuse me.

21:18.695 --> 21:23.314
Young dominus, I need your advice
on a delicate matter, if you'd be willing?

21:23.450 --> 21:24.860
lam.

21:24.993 --> 21:29.737
Suppose you saw something
which made you suspect something terrible.

21:29.873 --> 21:32.239
Would you tell the husband of the suspicion?

21:32.375 --> 21:34.866
Supposed suspicion of what?

21:36.963 --> 21:38.373
Another man.

21:38.506 --> 21:41.714
We are speaking of Vorenus
and his wife, I presume.

21:41.843 --> 21:43.959
I never said that.

21:46.055 --> 21:49.764
It seems to me that suspicion alone
is not enough to speak.

21:49.893 --> 21:55.354
Once spoken out, the suspicion
of such depravity can do the work of truth.

21:55.482 --> 21:57.473
And what if you are mistaken?

21:57.609 --> 22:00.191
Then Vorenus is dishonoured by error.

22:05.867 --> 22:08.153
I knew you'd hit thejugular.

22:31.643 --> 22:33.679
Refuses truce.

22:34.395 --> 22:36.477
What now?

22:42.070 --> 22:45.813
How happy, to be a slave.

22:47.075 --> 22:50.943
To have no will. To make no decisions.

22:51.079 --> 22:53.286
Driftwood.

22:53.414 --> 22:56.076
How very restful it must be.

23:08.972 --> 23:11.509
— Erastes Fulmen.
- Centurion.

23:14.978 --> 23:19.267
— I've come to seek your counsel.
- Always happy to help a friend.

23:19.899 --> 23:24.108
I need to borrow some money and I am told
you have friends in the lending trade.

23:24.237 --> 23:25.977
I do.

23:26.114 --> 23:30.073
I do. I only hesitate because I'm surprised.

23:30.201 --> 23:31.816
You was well found.

23:31.953 --> 23:35.195
My slaves were taken by the black flux.

23:35.331 --> 23:38.118
But once I raise capital, I'll go buy some more.

23:38.251 --> 23:40.207
I have good contacts in Narbo.

23:40.336 --> 23:42.588
— Be needing a big chunk then?
- I will.

23:45.675 --> 23:47.461
Icannot

23:47.594 --> 23:51.462
Wrong to lead a citizen
like yourself down that path.

23:51.598 --> 23:53.338
Rough business, moneylending.

23:53.474 --> 23:55.726
Man can't pay, he may have to suffer.

23:55.852 --> 24:01.813
Was I to introduce you to a lender,
I would be putting two wolves into one cage.

24:01.941 --> 24:04.318
To neither's benefit.

24:04.444 --> 24:07.811
You're right. Thank you for your time.

24:07.947 --> 24:11.064
Centurion, there are
other ways to make money.

24:11.200 --> 24:15.364
A man like you, there's situations
his simple presence would be valuable.

24:15.496 --> 24:18.203
— A man like me?
— A hard man.

24:18.333 --> 24:20.995
First Spear Centurion in Caesar's mighty 13th.

24:21.127 --> 24:25.086
— I'm no longer in the army.
— No matter. Your bearing is enough.

24:26.174 --> 24:29.666
You would lend dignity and strength
to business transactions.

24:29.802 --> 24:34.387
If you like, I could use you myself.
Show you the onions.

24:34.515 --> 24:38.633
That's good of you but I still don't see
what I would do, exactly.

24:40.647 --> 24:44.515
You would come with me
to discourage trouble.

24:44.651 --> 24:47.859
No one's going to mess with
a First Spear Centurion.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.524
I'd be a bodyguard.

24:56.037 --> 24:58.028
Good money.

25:00.083 --> 25:04.326
- I told you!
— I'm sorry, I couldn't help it.

25:04.879 --> 25:08.747
Damn you! Damn her! I am your wife. Me.

25:09.842 --> 25:11.707
Lyde!

25:32.407 --> 25:34.614
That's lovely.

25:34.742 --> 25:36.733
It's not too army—like?

25:36.869 --> 25:38.825
Like a man of deep business.

25:38.955 --> 25:41.662
I'm no businessman. I'm just a bodyguard.

25:41.791 --> 25:44.077
It's a start.

26:00.476 --> 26:02.933
Please, just for me.

26:08.776 --> 26:11.768
Caesar! Me!

26:16.909 --> 26:19.366
What is the matter with everybody?

26:23.624 --> 26:26.286
Lock him up, girls!

26:26.961 --> 26:28.792
Calpurnia!

26:41.434 --> 26:44.426
— Do not trouble yourself with denial.
- I did not intend to.

26:44.562 --> 26:48.646
Be rid of her and we say no more.
Or divorce will follow.

26:49.817 --> 26:52.399
Perhaps that is not enough to deter you.

26:52.528 --> 26:54.814
Be that as it may, I am indifferent.

26:58.159 --> 27:01.617
We cannot divorce now.
Her family's influence will be critical.

27:01.746 --> 27:03.657
I know it.

27:06.667 --> 27:10.205
— Centurion, you're right on time.
- Citizen.

27:11.839 --> 27:13.625
Why do we not meet in the Forum?

27:13.758 --> 27:17.342
Forum's only for closing deals,
putting a hand on it publicly.

27:24.393 --> 27:26.770
Enough of that Teuton droning!

27:26.896 --> 27:31.515
If you want to whistle like someone's bum boy,
whistle a good Roman song at least.

27:33.820 --> 27:38.530
— She complained I was like an elephant.
- Tanjit, my honey duck.

27:38.658 --> 27:39.818
You're looking well.

27:41.369 --> 27:43.576
I kiss your mother's feet.

27:43.704 --> 27:45.444
Please, sit.

27:45.581 --> 27:47.958
Would you like something to eat, drink?

27:48.084 --> 27:51.997
- Wine will do.
— We do not have wine. Milk, perhaps?

27:52.129 --> 27:54.541
Milk? Run out of piss, did you?

27:57.134 --> 27:59.125
Humour. Very good.

27:59.262 --> 28:03.801
I'm sad to have to come here.
I'm very depressed.

28:03.933 --> 28:07.926
I thought we were businessmen
and understood each other, yet here we are.

28:08.062 --> 28:10.053
Here we are.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.931
I'm only going to ask once.

28:13.067 --> 28:16.400
— Where's my money?
— Where's my truffle pigs?

28:16.529 --> 28:18.485
50 pigs you have, as ordered.

28:18.614 --> 28:21.105
50 diseased and scrofulous pigs.

28:21.242 --> 28:24.450
— Not one knows how to find truffles.
- Tricky beasts.

28:24.579 --> 28:28.071
Haven't been eating acorns?
Fucks them for truffling, acorns.

28:28.207 --> 28:31.074
I will give you one quarter price.
Out of friendship.

28:31.210 --> 28:35.419
You'll give me every mumping denarius,
you cack-faced cunny!

28:35.548 --> 28:38.130
Really, there is no call for rudeness.

28:38.259 --> 28:40.796
I'm told Hindus live on after death. That true?

28:40.928 --> 28:45.843
Our bodies die and decay as yours will
but our souls live on eternally.

28:45.975 --> 28:47.761
That's nice arrangements.

28:47.894 --> 28:50.556
— You're not afraid to die?
- Not at all.

29:02.783 --> 29:05.240
Break his arm.

29:06.287 --> 29:08.073
Break his arm.

29:32.146 --> 29:35.479
Give me my money, you monkey's cunt.

29:35.608 --> 29:37.599
Kiss my arse.

29:38.778 --> 29:40.643
Cut his throat.

29:46.744 --> 29:48.826
Cut it!

30:11.686 --> 30:13.847
What are you doing?

30:28.995 --> 30:31.577
What happened?

30:31.706 --> 30:33.788
What's wrong? Tell me.

30:35.501 --> 30:38.208
Erastes Fulmen asked me to kill a man.

30:40.381 --> 30:42.087
You refused him?

30:42.216 --> 30:44.582
What else was I to do?

30:44.719 --> 30:46.459
— I am no bandit.
- Of course not.

30:46.595 --> 30:48.506
You couldn't do other than you did.

30:48.639 --> 30:52.882
But how are we to pay the rent?
How are we to feed the children?

31:03.070 --> 31:04.935
He's here!

31:06.282 --> 31:09.115
I'm so glad! I thought you might not...

31:09.243 --> 31:10.904
I regret I cannot stay.

31:12.747 --> 31:14.703
I've come to say goodbye.

31:16.375 --> 31:20.584
— Goodbye?
— I'm going south in pursuit of Pompey.

31:20.713 --> 31:22.669
We shall not see each other again.

31:24.550 --> 31:27.007
— What, never?
— Never.

31:29.472 --> 31:31.053
Don't joke so.

31:31.182 --> 31:33.264
I am notjoking.

31:33.392 --> 31:37.476
— Is this because of some foolish graffiti?
— Servilia, we are done.

31:47.281 --> 31:50.273
How can you say that?

31:54.872 --> 31:59.366
- We love each other.
— Be assured, it is not that I do not love you.

32:00.503 --> 32:02.459
I do this against my own inclination.

32:02.588 --> 32:07.628
There are, however, larger issues at stake
and I must do what is right for the Republic.

32:09.678 --> 32:12.135
The Republic!

32:47.341 --> 32:49.707
Why so happy, Mother?

32:49.844 --> 32:51.584
No reason.

32:51.720 --> 32:54.928
None at all? No clever little plan bearing fruit?

32:55.057 --> 32:57.298
None at all, my poppet.

32:57.434 --> 33:01.393
Nor should you suggest othenNise...to anyone.

33:07.862 --> 33:10.524
- What's all the fuss?
— We go south tomorrow.

33:10.656 --> 33:14.615
Excellent. If we move fast,
Pompey will be eating dust by the kalends.

33:14.743 --> 33:17.951
You'll remain here
with the 13th to keep the peace.

33:18.080 --> 33:19.035
Keep the peace?

33:19.165 --> 33:22.407
The city will be in your charge.
I'll leave Posca to assist you.

33:22.543 --> 33:25.455
That's ridiculous!
I'm a soldier, not a peacekeeper.

33:25.588 --> 33:27.670
You'll follow orders, damn you.

33:46.192 --> 33:48.854
I was considering...

33:53.240 --> 33:55.401
I have a farm near here.

33:57.411 --> 33:59.993
Lovely at this time of year.

34:00.122 --> 34:03.239
I was considering that I might go there.

34:05.586 --> 34:07.872
Stay for the harvest.

34:10.132 --> 34:12.999
— Perhaps you'd like to join me?
— That is very kind.

34:14.094 --> 34:17.257
But I think I will stay here.

34:22.019 --> 34:24.260
No good will come of staying.

34:24.396 --> 34:28.435
I don't know. The sea air is bracing, at least.

34:28.567 --> 34:31.604
If you do not go, then I cannot go, I suppose.

34:32.571 --> 34:34.152
It would look cowardly.

34:34.281 --> 34:36.863
What matter? You would know it were not so.

34:36.992 --> 34:39.074
I would know, certainly.

34:40.454 --> 34:45.574
But I do not have
a grand shining old name like you.

34:46.794 --> 34:51.584
I must keep my name well—polished,
else it looks very dull.

34:55.970 --> 34:58.461
— I must stay, then.
— I'm sorry, old man.

35:56.655 --> 35:58.691
Soldier!

35:59.908 --> 36:01.773
You're on duty.

36:02.828 --> 36:04.910
The general will see you now.

36:21.513 --> 36:23.549
Copy this.

36:39.239 --> 36:41.730
What do you want, citizen?

36:43.827 --> 36:45.909
I've reconsidered my position, sir.

36:46.872 --> 36:49.158
And I wish to accept your offer.

36:50.167 --> 36:51.828
My offer?

36:53.379 --> 36:57.873
Of entry into evocati.
If same terms still apply.

36:58.008 --> 37:00.670
I said you could join evocati?

37:02.262 --> 37:04.548
With respect, sir, you did.

37:13.190 --> 37:15.806
What terms did I offer?

37:15.943 --> 37:19.731
Evocati prefect first grade, 10,000 sesterces.

37:21.532 --> 37:25.275
That's a generous offer.
One which you declined.

37:30.791 --> 37:36.502
Normally, I would never make
the same offer twice...but you're lucky.

37:36.630 --> 37:40.122
Caesar is away and I am here alone.

37:41.969 --> 37:44.301
And I shall need good men.

37:45.973 --> 37:52.594
So I give it you, promotion to prefect
and 9,000 sesterces.

37:56.442 --> 37:58.103
Thank you, sir.

37:59.695 --> 38:06.442
In return for my generosity,
Lucius Vorenus, I expect loyalty.

38:06.577 --> 38:08.659
Loyalty unto death.

38:10.747 --> 38:13.159
Unto death, sir.

38:20.340 --> 38:22.422
Welcome home.

38:29.975 --> 38:32.011
Dismissed.

38:36.565 --> 38:39.398
— Put him here.
— Domina.

38:39.526 --> 38:42.734
This is one of them that drew the filthy pictures.

38:42.863 --> 38:46.447
Didn't take long to make him speak.
Creature!

38:47.451 --> 38:49.407
Who hired him?

38:49.536 --> 38:51.151
Timon, the horse Jew.

38:52.414 --> 38:55.827
Atia's man. Dress me.

39:09.765 --> 39:12.973
— It's done.
— They'll have you back?

39:13.101 --> 39:15.137
They will.

39:40.587 --> 39:44.330
Evocati prefect first grade, 9,000 sesterces.

39:47.219 --> 39:49.301
I've sold myself to a tyrant.

39:55.686 --> 39:57.722
It had to be done.

39:59.398 --> 40:01.434
Thank you.

41:17.351 --> 41:23.062
Gods of the Junii,
with this offering I ask you to summon

41:23.190 --> 41:29.527
Tyche, Megara and Nemesis,
so that they witness this curse.

41:32.032 --> 41:34.489
By the spirits of my ancestors,

41:34.618 --> 41:40.955
I curse Gaius Julius Caesar.

41:41.083 --> 41:43.950
Let his penis wither.

41:44.086 --> 41:47.374
Let his bones crack.

41:47.506 --> 41:51.374
Let him see his legions
drown in their own blood.

41:51.510 --> 41:56.925
Gods of the inferno, I offer to you his limbs,

41:57.057 --> 42:00.970
his head, his mouth,

42:01.103 --> 42:05.187
his breath, his speech,

42:05.315 --> 42:08.603
his hands, his liver,

42:08.735 --> 42:12.819
his heart, his stomach.

42:13.365 --> 42:17.950
Gods of the inferno,
let me see him suffer deeply,

42:18.078 --> 42:22.162
and I will rejoice and sacrifice to you.

42:56.950 --> 42:59.157
By the spirits of my ancestors,

42:59.286 --> 43:01.868
I curse Atia of the Julii.

43:01.997 --> 43:04.704
Let dogs rape her.

43:04.833 --> 43:07.074
Let her children die

43:07.210 --> 43:09.371
and her houses burn.

43:09.504 --> 43:15.124
Let her live a long life
of bitter misery and shame.

43:16.303 --> 43:22.094
Gods of the inferno, I offer to you her limbs,

43:22.225 --> 43:26.810
her head, her mouth, her breath,

43:26.938 --> 43:30.351
her speech, her heart,

43:30.484 --> 43:33.851
her liver, her stomach.

43:33.987 --> 43:40.984
Gods of the inferno, let me see her
suffer deeply and I will rejoice

43:41.119 --> 43:43.405
and sacrifice to you.

44:25.622 --> 44:28.113
— Here we are, friend.
- What do you want?

44:28.250 --> 44:34.041
— Tell us what's between you and Niobe.
— Nothing. Never.

44:34.172 --> 44:38.541
I swear by Jupiter, never!
Furies tear my eyes out if I lie!

44:38.677 --> 44:42.090
What were you doing when I saw you with her?

44:42.222 --> 44:44.588
My wife...we were fighting.

44:44.724 --> 44:47.386
I went to Niobe for advice, that's all.

44:48.520 --> 44:53.105
I was crying, if you want to know the truth
and Niobe commiserated with me.

44:53.233 --> 44:55.064
I would never...

45:00.073 --> 45:02.280
— Maybe he's telling the truth.
— Lying.

45:02.409 --> 45:04.195
I'm not!

45:06.580 --> 45:10.243
If he says you're lying, then I believe him.

45:10.375 --> 45:13.117
This boy is clever, like you don't know what.

45:13.253 --> 45:15.039
— No, please, I beg you!
— Hush.

45:15.171 --> 45:17.127
Don't embarrass yourself.

45:27.267 --> 45:29.849
We know you're lying.
We know it, you understand?

45:29.978 --> 45:31.969
We have to kill you.

45:32.105 --> 45:34.642
- I never touched her.
— Evander, move fonNard.

45:34.774 --> 45:38.483
Your life is over. The only question is,
how do you want to die?

45:40.363 --> 45:44.026
We need to hear the truth.
If you persist in lying, we'll torture you.

45:44.159 --> 45:47.151
You'll die only after many hours
of agony and horror.

45:47.287 --> 45:50.495
You give us honesty now
and you'll go swiftly, painlessly.

45:50.624 --> 45:53.536
- Please.
— Evander, tell the truth.

45:59.090 --> 46:01.957
— Torture him.
— Juno's a cunt but you're salty.

46:02.093 --> 46:04.960
— And I was worried about bringing you.
— Go on, then.

46:07.265 --> 46:10.007
I've never actually tortured anyone.

46:10.143 --> 46:12.350
- I don't know how.
— You don't know how?

46:12.479 --> 46:15.971
— They have specialists!
— Why not cut off his thumbs?

46:16.107 --> 46:18.189
That's good enough. It's a start.

46:18.318 --> 46:22.106
Niobe and I were lovers! I confess it!

46:24.658 --> 46:26.194
Kill me if you must.

46:28.453 --> 46:29.989
Hold.

46:32.540 --> 46:34.155
What else?

46:34.292 --> 46:37.705
Nothing else. Kill me.

46:37.837 --> 46:39.919
You're lying again.

46:40.048 --> 46:43.540
You stand at Pluto's door.
Will you sully his threshold with lies?

46:43.677 --> 46:46.043
— I am done talking.
— Cut off his thumbs.

47:31.725 --> 47:33.590
The child!

47:34.978 --> 47:38.220
— The child is mine!
- What child?

47:39.149 --> 47:41.891
Lucius. The baby.

47:43.028 --> 47:44.984
Please, kill me now.

47:45.113 --> 47:49.447
— Lucius, Vorenus' son?
— Niobe's son.

47:50.660 --> 47:52.696
My son.

47:58.126 --> 48:00.287
It's...mine.

48:56.267 --> 48:58.849
We have buried this evil now.

48:58.978 --> 49:01.685
You must never speak of it again.

49:01.815 --> 49:03.931
Vorenus must never know.

49:04.943 --> 49:06.854
Never.

49:11.741 --> 49:17.862
Father Mars Strider,
this man has done faithful vigil for you!

49:17.997 --> 49:21.956
We therefore ask you
to take him under your protection.

49:22.085 --> 49:24.667
May his enemies flee from him.

49:24.796 --> 49:27.458
May their city walls crumble.

49:27.590 --> 49:34.712
May their cattle and women be taken.
This man...is now evocati.

50:00.874 --> 50:03.707
Sir, they've sailed for Greece.
