WEBVTT

00:04.560 --> 00:06.720
That last multiple-choice question
was really hard.

00:06.860 --> 00:08.160
- l got A.
- l got D.

00:08.300 --> 00:09.530
And l'm pretty sure l'm right.

00:09.670 --> 00:11.930
D wasn't even close.
Why are you so sure you're right?

00:12.070 --> 00:14.590
No, l got a D on the test.
l'm sure l'm right about that.

00:15.770 --> 00:16.860
Oh, look.

00:17.010 --> 00:20.100
Gigi's handing out invitations
to her annual tea.

00:20.240 --> 00:23.240
l'm so glad we're not invited,
because then we'd have to talk like this:

00:23.380 --> 00:25.080
Hello, Mumsy. Hello, Popsy.

00:25.220 --> 00:28.310
lsn't this a lovely tea?
Do you think my pinkie's high enough?

00:29.490 --> 00:31.980
No, higher, like this,
because if you're going to a fancy tea,

00:32.119 --> 00:35.250
you need to act
like you've smelt something terrible.

00:36.430 --> 00:38.290
Good afternoon, Alex, Harper.

00:38.430 --> 00:41.330
How is this lovely day
treating you so far?

00:41.470 --> 00:44.130
What happened to your faces?
Apply your makeup with a hammer?

00:47.500 --> 00:50.000
That is really funny, Alex, but incorrect.

00:50.140 --> 00:53.540
What you see is the result of a method
where they inject stuff into your forehead.

00:53.680 --> 00:56.840
Then, in a few days,
it falls down into your cheekbones.

00:57.310 --> 00:59.410
Wait a minute, timeout.
Why aren't you fighting back?

00:59.550 --> 01:02.350
We just bagged on your faces,
which should be in a bag.

01:04.989 --> 01:07.220
See? l did it again.
Why aren't you insulting me?

01:07.360 --> 01:08.760
Remember? We don't like each other.

01:08.890 --> 01:11.160
Oh, but that was back
when we were young and foolish.

01:11.290 --> 01:13.190
- That was yesterday.
- My point exactly.

01:15.070 --> 01:17.230
That's why l'm inviting you
to my tea this weekend.

01:17.370 --> 01:19.270
Your tea? l've always wanted to go.

01:19.400 --> 01:20.890
Thanks, Gigi, this is great.

01:21.040 --> 01:22.530
What?

01:22.670 --> 01:24.040
Well, l hope you guys can make it.

01:24.170 --> 01:26.540
Come, girls. Let's go make fun
of Eddie till he cries.

01:28.310 --> 01:30.370
Alex, l've always wanted
to go to a high tea.

01:30.510 --> 01:33.540
- l love the idea of eating tiny sandwiches.
- You're serious?

01:33.680 --> 01:36.740
l don't mean to sound unsupportive,
but are you out of your mind, woman?

01:36.890 --> 01:39.220
Gigi has terrorized us
since we were in kindergarten.

01:40.020 --> 01:42.510
Well, l think Gigi's taking the high road.

01:42.660 --> 01:44.890
And l wanna reach out to her.

01:45.030 --> 01:47.190
And if you wanna be a negative Nellie,
then go ahead.

01:47.330 --> 01:50.930
The only Nellie l know is Nellie Rodriguez,
and she's a very positive, upbeat person.

01:51.370 --> 01:53.130
Hi, Nellie. You going to Gigi's tea?

01:53.270 --> 01:56.360
Yeah. l can't wait.
lt's gonna be so much fun.

01:56.510 --> 01:58.570
So, what are you gonna wear?

02:00.010 --> 02:01.980
There's nothing worse
than a positive Nellie.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:58.940 --> 03:02.340
l can't believe you won't let me go
into the lair. You're bunk.

03:02.470 --> 03:04.440
l'm not the one
who said you can't go in the lair.

03:04.570 --> 03:06.270
Dad said no one can
while he's out of town.

03:06.410 --> 03:07.470
Call me bunk.

03:07.610 --> 03:09.010
Then how am l supposed to study

03:09.150 --> 03:12.510
these new pocket spell books that Dad's
gonna quiz us on when he gets home?

03:12.650 --> 03:14.980
You'll study like you do
for regular school.

03:15.120 --> 03:17.250
You'll sit here and do your work,
and l'll do mine.

03:17.720 --> 03:20.990
With your dad gone for the weekend,
l promised l'd do the bank deposit.

03:21.120 --> 03:23.180
l can't believe Dad's making us
memorize 20 spells.

03:23.330 --> 03:26.260
lt's like he's gone, but he's not gone.

03:27.600 --> 03:30.230
Can you at least stop shaking your leg?
l'm trying to concentrate.

03:30.730 --> 03:33.260
Shaking my leg is how l concentrate.

03:35.940 --> 03:39.170
- Cut it out.
- That's how l concentrate.

03:39.310 --> 03:41.640
Guys, please.
l'm trying to do this deposit.

03:41.780 --> 03:44.180
l know. lsn't Max so annoying?

03:44.310 --> 03:45.940
You're the one who flicked my ear.

03:46.080 --> 03:48.020
Oh, you mean like this?

03:48.150 --> 03:49.880
Okay, that's it. That's it.

03:50.020 --> 03:52.280
Come on. You guys
are gonna study your magic in the lair.

03:53.420 --> 03:54.820
Come on.

03:57.690 --> 03:59.490
See? We can't even get in if we want.

03:59.630 --> 04:01.530
Dad put a lock on it.
There's probably some kind

04:01.670 --> 04:04.900
of complicated magical spell on the lock
that we'll never be able to break.

04:05.040 --> 04:07.730
Or a giant key
hanging on a hook right here.

04:09.940 --> 04:12.530
l thought that was a decoration.

04:12.680 --> 04:14.470
Come on. Get in the lair.

04:14.610 --> 04:17.940
And don't tell your dad l let you in there.

04:26.820 --> 04:28.790
You know what today is a great day for?

04:28.930 --> 04:31.020
Today is a great day
for throwing myself into work.

04:31.160 --> 04:33.250
Take orders
and not talk about my problems.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.190
Slice salami
and not talk about my problems.

04:35.330 --> 04:37.800
Be nice to rude customers
and not tell them about my problems.

04:37.930 --> 04:40.660
You know me, service with a smile.

04:41.400 --> 04:44.310
Oh, honey, you sound like you
wanna talk about your problems.

04:44.440 --> 04:47.140
Mom, why are you always
in my business?

04:47.780 --> 04:49.240
Okay, fine.

04:49.380 --> 04:51.280
All right, l'll tell you.

04:51.410 --> 04:53.640
Gigi invited Harper and l to her tea.

04:53.780 --> 04:56.720
But Harper's gonna go.
She thinks Gigi's nice all of a sudden.

04:56.850 --> 04:59.250
Well, people change.
Maybe Gigi is nicer.

04:59.390 --> 05:02.920
Mom, if l'm gonna tell you about my
problems, you have to agree with them.

05:03.590 --> 05:06.490
Okay, okay. Gigi, horrible, mean.

05:06.630 --> 05:07.860
l know. lsn't she?

05:08.000 --> 05:09.520
But Harper doesn't think so.

05:09.670 --> 05:12.190
So l guess Harper and l
aren't friends anymore.

05:12.340 --> 05:13.930
Oh, don't say that.

05:14.070 --> 05:16.940
You and Harper have been friends forever.
And you'll always be friends.

05:17.070 --> 05:18.700
You'll just have your ups
and your downs.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.000
Right, like when we were nine

05:20.140 --> 05:22.810
and we had the lemonade stand
and Harper kept all the money.

05:23.210 --> 05:24.940
Well, she did do all the work.

05:25.080 --> 05:26.640
- Mom.
- Sorry.

05:26.780 --> 05:27.980
Sorry.

05:34.290 --> 05:36.450
Where's the spell to get you
to stop shaking your leg?

05:39.700 --> 05:40.820
Wizard mail?

05:40.960 --> 05:44.630
You know, we always get wizard mail,
but we've never sent any out.

05:45.340 --> 05:47.300
You're right.

05:48.770 --> 05:50.640
Let's send out some prank mail.

05:53.280 --> 05:56.840
Stranded on a deserted island

05:56.980 --> 06:00.310
in the lava sea.

06:00.780 --> 06:01.940
There's a lava sea?

06:02.090 --> 06:04.850
l don't know. lt's prank mail.

06:05.290 --> 06:07.350
Got it, got it.

06:07.490 --> 06:10.320
Wait. All we have to eat is hot rocks.

06:11.190 --> 06:12.350
l like your thinking.

06:13.360 --> 06:15.020
And now

06:16.800 --> 06:20.400
we send out our first piece
of wizard mail.

06:24.010 --> 06:25.100
Cool. Now what?

06:25.240 --> 06:28.340
Now we wait.

06:35.690 --> 06:37.710
Oh, now we're having fun, huh?

06:37.850 --> 06:40.690
This is awesome.

06:48.130 --> 06:50.070
- Hey.
- Harper.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.960
Hi.

06:53.840 --> 06:54.900
Hey, Harper, what's up?

06:55.040 --> 06:56.670
Oh, Gigi invited me to a sleepover.

06:56.810 --> 07:00.210
She wants me to make snickerdoodles.
The ones with the red-hot candies.

07:00.340 --> 07:02.640
Obviously, she really wants
to be my friend.

07:02.780 --> 07:04.250
lt's unbelievable.

07:04.380 --> 07:06.910
Yeah, it's unbelievable.
As in, l don't believe it.

07:07.050 --> 07:08.180
l mean, come on.

07:08.320 --> 07:10.840
Have you seen anyone finish one
of your spicy snickerdoodles?

07:10.990 --> 07:12.750
lt's Gigi. She doesn't like us.

07:12.890 --> 07:15.190
lf she invites you to her party,
it's to put whipped cream

07:15.330 --> 07:17.760
in your hand while you're sleeping
and then tickle your nose.

07:17.890 --> 07:20.450
l thought you were gonna be supportive.

07:20.600 --> 07:24.660
l am. l ate your snickerdoodles
the first time you made them.

07:25.570 --> 07:26.660
What's that?

07:26.800 --> 07:29.470
lt's the crown we're gonna present
to the best newcomer at the tea.

07:29.610 --> 07:31.270
- Oh, can l see it?
- Oh, no, no, silly.

07:31.410 --> 07:32.900
lt's a surprise.

07:33.040 --> 07:35.310
- l can't wait.
- Neither can we.

07:37.680 --> 07:39.940
Something's up.

07:43.650 --> 07:46.140
Some people are a gem
Some people are a rat

07:46.290 --> 07:49.780
To learn who's who
Give me the ear of a bat

07:51.900 --> 07:55.060
Oh, my gosh. Harper came so close
to seeing the crown.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.290
l wanna see it.

07:56.700 --> 07:58.290
Okay.

08:01.740 --> 08:03.760
Do you see the L? lt stands for loser.

08:03.910 --> 08:07.100
And it's gonna look so good on Harper
when she's crowned the biggest loser.

08:07.240 --> 08:10.440
Yeah, at our
who-can-bring-the-biggest-loser party.

08:17.620 --> 08:21.060
What does this one smell like?

08:22.190 --> 08:26.030
The stuff that grows between your toes,
mixed with a little earwax.

08:26.160 --> 08:28.320
Amazing. You're right.

08:29.100 --> 08:30.360
The bottle's back.

08:31.170 --> 08:32.900
What's it say?

08:35.169 --> 08:36.900
''We've received your plea for help.

08:37.039 --> 08:40.640
Do not move or leave the island.
The hot lava sea will burn you up.''

08:41.240 --> 08:42.730
Good to know.

08:42.880 --> 08:45.470
''Emergency wizards will arrive
to rescue you soon.''

08:45.620 --> 08:46.810
They bought it.

08:46.950 --> 08:50.890
''Please use the emergency supplies
to stay alive until we arrive.''

08:51.020 --> 08:53.780
What? There aren't
any emergency supplies.

08:53.920 --> 08:55.360
They're pranking us back.

08:58.500 --> 09:01.360
''Emergency wizard supplies.''

09:01.970 --> 09:03.160
Oh, a life raft.

09:03.300 --> 09:06.230
l wonder if it's a magical life raft.

09:09.240 --> 09:12.680
Wow, emergency wizards are coming.
They think we're really in trouble.

09:13.540 --> 09:16.840
Max, emergency wizards are coming.
We really are in trouble.

09:16.980 --> 09:20.140
Well, maybe there's a chance
they won't find us.

09:32.260 --> 09:33.660
What are those gloves for?

09:33.800 --> 09:37.230
l'm getting used to them for Gigi's tea.
l need to practice handling things.

09:37.370 --> 09:38.430
Why?

09:43.610 --> 09:45.440
That's why.

09:47.640 --> 09:48.700
Aren't you gonna help me?

09:48.850 --> 09:50.870
Why? They're already bruised.

09:54.820 --> 09:56.010
Harper.

09:56.150 --> 09:59.020
Maybe you shouldn't go to Gigi's tea.

09:59.160 --> 10:02.320
lt's really a
who-can-bring-the-biggest-loser contest.

10:02.790 --> 10:03.850
Biggest-loser contest?

10:03.990 --> 10:06.690
Alex, l can't believe you're making stuff up.
lt's just sad.

10:06.830 --> 10:08.920
l'm not making it up. l heard Gigi say it.

10:09.070 --> 10:11.160
Oh, Alex, l know you wanted
to hear that,

10:11.300 --> 10:14.900
but we all wanna hear a lot of things
we're never going to hear.

10:16.610 --> 10:18.600
You're never gonna believe me,
are you?

10:18.740 --> 10:20.970
Alex, Alex, Alex.

10:21.110 --> 10:23.140
Real friends accept each other
branching out.

10:23.280 --> 10:26.340
They don't get competitive and jealous
and make up ridiculous stories.

10:26.480 --> 10:28.880
So you're going to that tea
no matter what l say?

10:29.020 --> 10:30.450
Yes, l am.

10:31.520 --> 10:33.610
l can't believe l'm doing this, but

10:33.760 --> 10:36.280
- l'm going too.
- Oh, my gosh.

10:36.430 --> 10:39.420
Yep, you're my friend, so l have
to be with you through thick and thin.

10:39.560 --> 10:41.660
And l have a feeling
that this tea is gonna be thick.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.890
Or thin, whichever one is bad.

10:44.700 --> 10:46.670
Thank you, Alex.
This is gonna be awesome.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.000
We can support each other.

10:48.140 --> 10:50.470
l'll come over four hours before the tea
for a pre-tea tea.

10:50.610 --> 10:52.630
We can get dressed together,
practice our manners--

10:52.780 --> 10:54.140
How about l meet you there?

11:04.250 --> 11:07.550
Hey, Mom. We were just wondering
if maybe we could go to Grandma's.

11:08.490 --> 11:09.920
- Why?
- Why?

11:10.060 --> 11:13.360
Because we pulled a prank,
and now emergency wizards are after us.

11:14.830 --> 11:17.130
Look, it's not that bad.

11:17.270 --> 11:20.130
We just sent a prank message
in a bottle through the wizard mail

11:20.270 --> 11:22.760
saying we needed help,
and emergency wizards responded

11:22.910 --> 11:25.070
saying they're coming.

11:25.580 --> 11:27.840
Okay, it's bad.

11:28.410 --> 11:31.040
You guys are in an enormous amount
of trouble.

11:31.180 --> 11:34.410
We know, we know. l wish we never
would've asked to go into the lair.

11:34.550 --> 11:36.680
And you never would've let us in.

11:36.820 --> 11:39.690
Yup. lt's really your fault.

11:41.090 --> 11:43.180
Well, maybe we can go stay
at Grandma's.

11:52.840 --> 11:54.500
Ladies.

11:55.470 --> 12:01.240
Welcome to tea at the Hotel Fleur
du Blahglublahfluflagettyflah.

12:01.380 --> 12:03.640
The Hotel what? How do you spell that?

12:04.350 --> 12:06.010
ln French.

12:07.220 --> 12:09.280
We are proud to present this tea,

12:09.420 --> 12:13.860
served to you on the finest china
imported from Japan.

12:15.090 --> 12:20.050
Hosted by
young Miss Gigi Hollingsworth.

12:21.630 --> 12:25.230
l know you'll act
in the most ladylike fashion.

12:25.370 --> 12:31.360
Enjoy your tea here at the Hotel Fleur
du Blahglublahfluflagettyflah.

12:33.710 --> 12:35.080
Remind me to stop at the gift shop

12:35.210 --> 12:37.300
and get a T-shirt
with the hotel's name on it.

12:37.780 --> 12:40.250
Harper, Alex, l'm so glad
you guys could make it.

12:40.380 --> 12:42.080
l mean, your attendance
is gonna make this

12:42.220 --> 12:43.650
the most special tea l've ever had.

12:43.790 --> 12:46.080
Well, thanks, Gigi.
l'm so glad you invited me.

12:46.220 --> 12:48.210
Oh, not as glad as l am.

12:48.360 --> 12:50.420
Attention, everyone.

13:06.740 --> 13:09.370
Okay, then. Well, now that we've all had
a chance to mingle,

13:09.510 --> 13:11.810
l have a huge announcement
l'd like to make.

13:11.950 --> 13:13.310
Let's go look at the ladies' room.

13:13.450 --> 13:15.970
l hear it's so fancy,
the toilet's filled with bottled water.

13:16.590 --> 13:18.580
Plus the soaps look like little seashells.

13:18.720 --> 13:21.320
Oh, l love those. But l really should stay.

13:21.460 --> 13:23.250
l think Gigi's gonna say
something important.

13:23.390 --> 13:24.450
She usually does.

13:26.260 --> 13:28.460
And now it's time
to announce the best newcomer

13:28.600 --> 13:30.260
and present her with the special crown.

13:31.700 --> 13:32.860
l really think we should go.

13:33.000 --> 13:36.030
lf we don't go soon, the soaps
will get used and just be soapy lumps.

13:36.170 --> 13:39.230
Look, l don't care
about your soapy lumps.

13:40.180 --> 13:42.670
l can't let this happen.

13:45.050 --> 13:47.040
Truth spell, truth spell.

13:47.180 --> 13:51.920
Some are evil, some are kind
But now all must speak their mind

13:52.050 --> 13:54.350
lf my parents could afford
the same dermatologist as Gigi,

13:54.490 --> 13:55.860
l'd be way prettier than her.

13:57.130 --> 13:58.920
Oh, my gosh. Did l just say that?

14:00.500 --> 14:02.360
After l clean my ears, l look.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.900
What's wrong with me?

14:05.030 --> 14:06.630
Please pick me for best newcomer.

14:06.770 --> 14:09.740
Please, please, oh, pretty please
with a cherry on top.

14:09.870 --> 14:11.770
l hope this isn't one of those loser teas.

14:11.910 --> 14:14.880
lt'll be the fifth one l've been to this year.

14:17.080 --> 14:19.170
Jennifer looks way prettier than me.

14:19.320 --> 14:21.080
l'm gonna talk her into a bad haircut.

14:21.220 --> 14:23.550
Hey, Jen,
l'm gonna talk you into a bad haircut.

14:23.690 --> 14:25.780
Why did l just say that?

14:27.890 --> 14:32.220
Oh, this is going better than l thought.
Hey, everybody, l'm a wizard.

14:42.870 --> 14:43.930
You guys got everything?

14:44.670 --> 14:47.140
l called Grandma,
and she's blowing up our mattresses.

14:48.910 --> 14:50.000
When your dad gets back,

14:50.150 --> 14:52.810
we have to make sure
we have our story straight.

14:57.650 --> 15:00.550
Or we could get our story straight now.

15:02.120 --> 15:03.180
Officer Lamp.

15:03.330 --> 15:06.230
This is my partner. He's a goblin.

15:07.200 --> 15:08.890
- l have a name.
- Yeah.

15:09.030 --> 15:11.830
But nobody can pronounce that.

15:12.740 --> 15:14.200
We're emergency wizards.

15:14.340 --> 15:16.430
l have a report here
of someone using the wizard mail

15:16.570 --> 15:18.040
to request emergency services

15:18.170 --> 15:22.010
when, in fact,
no services were required.

15:22.140 --> 15:25.080
Yeah, they pranked us.

15:25.920 --> 15:29.320
- That's what l just said.
- But you took too long, you know?

15:30.090 --> 15:34.390
- We're just an ordinary family enjoying--
- You guys are in the wrong place, right?

15:34.860 --> 15:39.090
This is the Russo family
of Waverly Place, New York, New York?

15:39.230 --> 15:43.960
Home to wizards-in-training Justin,
Alex and Max?

15:44.370 --> 15:47.500
These are not the droids
you're looking for.

15:48.910 --> 15:49.960
What are you doing?

15:50.110 --> 15:53.410
Nothing. l figured l'd give it a shot.

15:53.540 --> 15:56.310
Okay, l see.

15:56.450 --> 15:58.570
Was that short enough for you?

15:58.710 --> 16:01.150
Oh, now we're doing short jokes?

16:02.150 --> 16:04.780
Guys, so l guess we're cool, then?

16:04.920 --> 16:07.150
Yeah, we're cool.

16:07.290 --> 16:09.820
Just after we ask you a few questions.

16:09.960 --> 16:12.220
lndividually.

16:19.740 --> 16:21.640
Did you just say you're a wizard?

16:22.770 --> 16:26.370
l wanna say no,
but yes, l did say l was a wizard.

16:26.510 --> 16:27.940
You think you're a wizard?

16:28.380 --> 16:30.400
Yeah, but everybody's saying
crazy stuff right now.

16:30.550 --> 16:32.540
l want Gigi to say some stuff to you now.

16:32.680 --> 16:36.980
The truth is, l hate wearing this dress.

16:37.790 --> 16:39.120
You wanna know what l wanna do?

16:39.590 --> 16:41.580
- l wanna break this.
- Do it.

16:43.790 --> 16:45.660
That felt good.

16:47.260 --> 16:49.730
You know what l've always
really wanted to do?

16:50.170 --> 16:52.160
This.

16:55.040 --> 16:58.600
Great idea, Gigi. That looks like fun.

17:03.780 --> 17:05.540
Stop. Stop.

17:05.680 --> 17:08.339
All l wanted is a tea
with sandwiches and gloves

17:08.480 --> 17:11.420
and small talk that no one would
remember when they got home.

17:12.420 --> 17:13.790
That isn't what this tea's about.

17:13.920 --> 17:16.260
l know you won't believe me,
but you're gonna believe Gigi.

17:16.390 --> 17:19.380
- Gigi.
- Ladies, ladies.

17:19.530 --> 17:22.000
Finally, someone to restore order.

17:22.130 --> 17:23.260
No.

17:23.400 --> 17:26.630
Here's something
l've always wanted to do.

17:37.410 --> 17:39.280
How you doing today, Max?

17:39.420 --> 17:41.010
l'm fine, thanks.

17:41.150 --> 17:42.670
ls it okay if l call you Maxy?

17:42.820 --> 17:46.310
l got a note here that says
they sometimes call you Maxy.

17:47.420 --> 17:48.910
Yeah, Maxy's cool.

17:49.060 --> 17:51.650
l'm trying out Maximillions, though.
See if it catches on.

17:51.790 --> 17:54.820
- That's great, Maxy.
- l guess it's not catching on.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.600
Are those shoes new?

17:57.730 --> 18:00.130
No. You sure you don't want
to try out Maximillions?

18:00.270 --> 18:01.530
l'm done with him, Goblin.

18:01.670 --> 18:03.900
Get him out of here.

18:05.640 --> 18:07.440
So, Justin,

18:07.580 --> 18:09.640
word on the street is that
you're the best student,

18:09.780 --> 18:12.580
regular and wizard school.

18:16.190 --> 18:18.210
l do okay.

18:18.920 --> 18:21.080
l guess that means
you're smart enough to realize

18:21.220 --> 18:24.450
that Maxy, cute kid,
told us the whole story.

18:24.590 --> 18:26.530
And if your story
doesn't exactly match his,

18:26.660 --> 18:29.650
well, we're gonna have a problem.

18:33.840 --> 18:36.530
l don't know what you're talking about.

18:37.040 --> 18:39.060
We didn't do anything.

18:39.880 --> 18:41.600
Get out of here.

18:41.980 --> 18:43.070
l'll go when l'm ready.

18:49.850 --> 18:52.720
Theresa Russo. Mortal.

18:52.860 --> 18:55.050
Married to former wizard Jerry Russo.

18:55.190 --> 18:57.220
Yeah, you have a couple of nice kids.

18:57.360 --> 18:59.690
We did it. l mean, they did it, but--

18:59.830 --> 19:02.700
l let them into the lair,
so l guess we did it.

19:04.130 --> 19:06.100
We? l? Who was it, lady?

19:06.240 --> 19:08.800
lt was me, but they drove me to it.

19:08.940 --> 19:12.340
There was leg-shaking and ear-flicking,
and l had to do the bank deposit.

19:12.480 --> 19:15.670
Do you have any idea how hard it is
to run a business from your home?

19:17.380 --> 19:18.940
Tell you what we're gonna do.

19:19.080 --> 19:20.640
You're gonna let me off with a warning,

19:20.780 --> 19:23.550
because l'm not a wizard,
and l didn't know any better.

19:23.690 --> 19:25.880
What, are you living in a fantasy world?

19:28.060 --> 19:30.150
l feel so free.

19:30.290 --> 19:34.960
l hate the Hotel Fleur
du Blahglublahfluflagettyflah.

19:37.070 --> 19:39.660
Stop it. You have no manners.

19:39.800 --> 19:43.240
l know this isn't going the way you
want it to, but this is what had to happen.

19:43.370 --> 19:47.670
Gigi, why don't you tell everybody the real
reason why you had this stupid tea?

19:47.810 --> 19:48.940
Okay, that's easy.

19:49.080 --> 19:52.780
The truth is that this tea is really a contest
to see who can bring the biggest loser.

19:52.920 --> 19:56.150
And l brought Harper.
She was just about to be crowned winner.

19:56.290 --> 19:57.910
You think l'm the biggest loser?

19:59.290 --> 20:02.090
So all the sleepovers
and the snickerdoodles, that was a lie?

20:02.220 --> 20:05.680
Yeah. We were trying to string you along
and get you to come to this loser tea.

20:08.300 --> 20:11.360
And you didn't come for the tea.
You came to protect me.

20:11.770 --> 20:13.670
l'll always protect you. lt's what we do.

20:14.500 --> 20:16.060
You know, it's funny.

20:16.210 --> 20:19.000
You brought Nellie
when Nellie really should've brought you.

20:19.540 --> 20:23.500
See that? Gigi thinks you're a bigger loser,
and you're supposedly her friend.

20:23.650 --> 20:26.010
Oh, you think l'm a loser?

20:26.150 --> 20:27.740
Well, this is what l think of you.

20:31.120 --> 20:33.590
Now, what do you wanna do
with that cake?

20:34.090 --> 20:35.580
l wanna eat it.

20:37.560 --> 20:40.500
Okay. What's the second thing
you wanna do with that cake?

20:41.460 --> 20:43.690
Throw it at Gigi.

20:52.440 --> 20:54.770
l don't like Gigi either.

20:54.910 --> 20:56.400
Here.

20:58.080 --> 20:59.880
l think that it's time that Gigi gets a taste

21:00.020 --> 21:02.310
of what she's been dishing out
to all of us for years.

21:02.450 --> 21:03.980
No, no.

21:06.690 --> 21:08.620
Oh, stop, everybody.

21:09.330 --> 21:12.620
Stop. l honestly think
l may have gone too far.

21:13.400 --> 21:15.160
You think?

21:16.270 --> 21:18.670
But l know someone who hasn't.

21:18.800 --> 21:20.390
Harper.

21:21.200 --> 21:22.670
You want me to wear the loser crown?

21:22.810 --> 21:24.860
- Well, okay.
- No.

21:28.310 --> 21:29.610
Oh, okay.

21:33.620 --> 21:37.280
Well, it's not exactly the tea l imagined,
but l'll never forget it.

21:37.420 --> 21:38.850
- Let's go home.
- Not yet.

21:38.990 --> 21:42.120
There's something l saw
that l kind of wanna do before we leave.

21:44.830 --> 21:47.850
You guys know you have to clean
all this up, right?

21:48.000 --> 21:49.060
We kind of figured.

21:49.200 --> 21:50.960
And pay for everything you broke.

21:51.100 --> 21:53.970
That's fair.
Can we do two more swings?

21:54.640 --> 21:55.800
Sure.

22:04.210 --> 22:06.550
How is washing their laundry
community service?

22:07.220 --> 22:10.210
We're part of the community,
aren't we?

22:11.790 --> 22:13.720
Oh, that's bunk.

22:13.860 --> 22:16.260
Hey, careful with that. That's my wife's.

22:16.390 --> 22:17.920
Oh, it's lovely.

22:18.060 --> 22:21.550
She must be very handy.
