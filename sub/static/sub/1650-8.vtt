WEBVTT

00:03.045 --> 00:06.037
(thunder rumbling)

00:08.176 --> 00:10.838
(woman screams )

00:11.012 --> 00:13.970
( rasping )

00:19.854 --> 00:22.846
(woman screaming )

00:42.335 --> 00:45.077
(woman screaming )

00:45.254 --> 00:47.245
( distant walkers rasping )

00:58.893 --> 01:00.258
- ( grunts)
- Oh, my God, Tyreese!

01:00.436 --> 01:01.846
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:02.021 --> 01:03.352
We gotta keep moving.

01:03.522 --> 01:06.059
- Where's everybody else?
- They were just behind me.

01:06.234 --> 01:07.519
Is there a clearing ahead?
A place to regroup?

01:07.693 --> 01:08.944
I didn't get very far.

01:09.111 --> 01:10.976
There might be
a building up ahead.

01:11.155 --> 01:13.237
I thought I saw a tower
past the trees.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.898
- Tower? What kind of tower?
- ( woman screaming )

01:22.250 --> 01:23.706
This way!

01:25.378 --> 01:27.664
Come on, come on.

01:35.263 --> 01:36.753
(screaming )

01:36.931 --> 01:38.762
Mom!

01:45.773 --> 01:48.059
Tyreese:
Come on!

02:02.415 --> 02:04.952
Hurry! This way!

02:10.923 --> 02:12.709
Come on!

02:12.883 --> 02:14.965
We don't know
what's in there.

02:15.136 --> 02:17.502
We know
what's out here.

02:19.557 --> 02:21.388
Nothen

02:21.559 --> 02:23.015
Don't.

02:23.185 --> 02:25.801
She's slowing you down,
she's slowing us down.

02:25.980 --> 02:28.016
And once we're in there,
when she turns...

02:28.190 --> 02:30.476
She's right.
You gotta leave me.

02:30.651 --> 02:33.358
No. Please.

02:33.529 --> 02:35.190
They'll tear her apart.

02:35.364 --> 02:36.979
Sasha.

02:38.326 --> 02:40.191
- We can't do this.
- You wanna drag her around?

02:40.369 --> 02:42.701
She's suffering.
And when she finally turns--

02:42.872 --> 02:44.863
Ben's not ready.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.662
- It's a mistake.
- Maybe.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.957
(walkers rasping )

03:26.707 --> 03:26.741
(theme music playing )

03:26.749 --> 03:29.866
(theme music playing )

04:21.679 --> 04:23.965
( footsteps approaching )

04:30.438 --> 04:34.477
I promised Milton l'd help him
cremate Mr. Coleman's body.

04:34.650 --> 04:35.981
That's sweet of you,

04:36.152 --> 04:38.393
but if you're still rattled,
he can handle it himself.

04:38.571 --> 04:40.732
He shouldn't have to.

04:40.906 --> 04:42.362
All these people
you've brought together,

04:42.533 --> 04:44.694
they're here for more
than just protection;

04:44.869 --> 04:47.861
they're helping each other
through this mess.

04:48.038 --> 04:50.825
Woodbury's starting
to grow on you, huh?

04:52.460 --> 04:54.200
Good.

05:09.143 --> 05:11.134
( door opens)

05:12.980 --> 05:14.971
( closes )

05:26.994 --> 05:28.859
( piano music playing )

05:29.038 --> 05:31.404
( raspy breathing )

05:38.422 --> 05:40.413
Penny?

05:46.055 --> 05:48.011
Honey?

05:53.062 --> 05:54.552
lt's Daddy.

05:56.065 --> 05:57.726
(snarling )

06:02.363 --> 06:03.978
Hey, hey.

06:05.741 --> 06:07.572
Shh.

06:07.743 --> 06:09.199
Baby.

06:09.370 --> 06:12.282
(growling)

06:12.456 --> 06:14.071
Hey, hey, hey.

06:14.250 --> 06:17.367
J‘ Bye-bye, baby bunting... J‘

06:17.545 --> 06:20.036
Come here.

06:20.214 --> 06:25.709
(singing along )
J‘ Daddy's gone a-hunting J‘

06:25.886 --> 06:31.722
J‘ To get a little rabbit skin J‘

06:31.892 --> 06:37.888
- J‘ To wrap his baby... J‘
- J‘ To wrap his baby bunting in... J‘

06:49.076 --> 06:50.941
Look at me, baby.

06:53.372 --> 06:55.784
Look at me.

06:59.295 --> 07:01.206
Look at me!

07:01.380 --> 07:03.917
( music stops)

07:16.520 --> 07:19.512
(Maggie crying)

07:25.237 --> 07:27.774
Maggie, did he--

07:27.948 --> 07:29.279
No.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.907
No.

07:32.077 --> 07:33.658
He barely touched me.

07:39.501 --> 07:42.538
All this time,
running from walkers--

07:42.713 --> 07:46.205
you forget what people do,

07:46.383 --> 07:49.125
have always done.

07:49.303 --> 07:52.386
Look at what
they did to you.

07:54.475 --> 07:56.716
Doesn't matter.

07:59.897 --> 08:01.228
As long as he didn't--

08:01.398 --> 08:05.357
No. I promise.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.616
Glenn: Hey.

08:21.794 --> 08:23.785
( groans )

08:41.188 --> 08:44.521
(grunting)

08:51.365 --> 08:53.196
( groans )

09:04.670 --> 09:08.083
- ( shouting )
-( bones cracking )

09:37.494 --> 09:39.906
(whispering )
Hey! Hey!

09:40.080 --> 09:42.742
Damn it.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.243
All right,
we need to downsize.

09:49.840 --> 09:53.003
Ain't no way we're gonna
check in all them buildings,

09:53.177 --> 09:56.089
not with all
them guards there.

10:00.809 --> 10:02.345
( twig snaps )

10:02.519 --> 10:04.225
( mouths words)

10:05.773 --> 10:07.263
All right, let's go.

10:09.985 --> 10:12.818
The prison's the perfect
place to hole up.

10:12.988 --> 10:16.776
What once kept prisoners in
now keeps biters out.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.451
And that's smart.

10:18.619 --> 10:22.453
You thinking of taking it over,
moving Woodbury there?

10:22.623 --> 10:26.161
People love it here
because it feels like what was.

10:26.335 --> 10:30.248
Move them to damp cells
surrounded by barbed wire?

10:30.422 --> 10:31.753
No.

10:31.924 --> 10:33.789
We gotta take out the group
that's living there.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.379
Let the biters move back in.
No one'll be the wiser.

10:36.553 --> 10:39.590
The problem is
my brother's with them.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.886
Well, you'll talk to him.

10:44.061 --> 10:46.143
Make him our inside man.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.178
He'll get us in there.

10:48.357 --> 10:49.688
We'll wave the white flag

10:49.858 --> 10:52.850
like we did with
the National Guard.

10:53.028 --> 10:56.361
- Nothing happens to Daryl.
- Of course not.

10:57.741 --> 11:00.403
What about Glenn
and the girl?

11:01.912 --> 11:03.243
Well, the longer they're here,

11:03.413 --> 11:06.997
the more chance
Andrea will find out.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.203
Take them to
the Screamer Pits.

11:14.716 --> 11:16.707
( crickets chirping )

11:34.778 --> 11:36.689
Rick:
This is where you were held?

11:36.864 --> 11:38.354
Michonne:
l was questioned.

11:38.532 --> 11:40.193
Any idea where else
they could be?

11:47.249 --> 11:48.830
I thought you said
there was a curfew.

11:49.001 --> 11:50.992
The street is packed during the day.
Those are stragglers.

11:51.169 --> 11:52.875
Rick: If anyone comes in here,
we're sitting ducks.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.708
We gotta move.

11:55.883 --> 11:57.999
Michonne:
They could be in his apartment.

11:58.176 --> 11:59.552
Yeah?
What if they ain't?

11:59.720 --> 12:01.927
Then we'll look
somewhere else.

12:02.097 --> 12:05.965
- You said you could help us.
- I'm doing what I can.

12:06.143 --> 12:08.976
- Then where in the hell are they?
- Hey.

12:14.234 --> 12:17.067
If this goes south,
we're cutting her loose.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.228
You think she's leading us
into a trap?

12:19.406 --> 12:21.488
Right now it's the blind
leading the blind.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.489
Let's split up.

12:23.660 --> 12:25.275
( knocking at door)

12:25.454 --> 12:27.035
( keys jangling )

12:31.752 --> 12:33.492
I know you're in here.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.877
I saw you moving
from outside.

12:38.342 --> 12:42.130
All right, now. You're not supposed
to be in here and you know it.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.759
Who's in here?

12:46.934 --> 12:49.300
Shutup.
Get on your knees.

12:49.478 --> 12:50.968
Hands behind your back.

12:51.146 --> 12:52.511
Zip tie him.

12:52.689 --> 12:54.020
Where are our people?

12:54.191 --> 12:55.601
I don't know.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.107
You are holding
some of our people.

12:57.277 --> 13:00.064
- Where the hell are they?
- I don't know.

13:01.323 --> 13:02.859
Open your mouth.

13:03.033 --> 13:05.149
(grunting)

13:18.256 --> 13:20.508
You are good with her.

13:20.676 --> 13:23.668
- You got little sisters?
- No.

13:23.845 --> 13:26.678
- Axel: How old are you, anyway?
- Beth: 17.

13:26.848 --> 13:29.760
17. Interesting.

13:29.935 --> 13:33.052
May I speak with you?

13:33.230 --> 13:34.720
Me?

13:36.900 --> 13:38.765
I'll be right back.

13:45.909 --> 13:48.946
- What's the problem?
- Stay away from her.

13:49.121 --> 13:50.782
Please.

13:50.956 --> 13:52.992
This isn't about you trying
to repopulate the earth.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.497
I didn't mean no offense.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.750
I've been locked up
a long while

13:56.920 --> 13:58.285
and, well,
there weren't many women.

13:58.463 --> 13:59.919
You following me?

14:00.090 --> 14:02.672
I mean, Maggie, she's with Glenn
and you're a lesbian.

14:02.843 --> 14:04.674
l was just talking with her.

14:04.845 --> 14:06.255
I'm not a lesbian.

14:06.430 --> 14:10.093
You got the... short hair.

14:12.227 --> 14:14.434
You're not a lesbian?

14:16.523 --> 14:18.889
My, my,

14:19.067 --> 14:21.979
this is interesting.

14:22.154 --> 14:24.145
No, it's not.

14:27.284 --> 14:29.275
(yells)

14:36.460 --> 14:38.826
- ( gunfire)
-( people shouting )

14:54.394 --> 14:56.385
Let him go!

15:01.985 --> 15:03.725
Okay.

15:06.281 --> 15:07.896
Give me the gun!

15:08.075 --> 15:09.440
Get up!

15:26.927 --> 15:29.384
( Merle speaking,
indistinct )

15:29.554 --> 15:32.091
Glad we could catch up.

15:34.059 --> 15:36.675
Just keep looking at me.

15:36.853 --> 15:38.889
I love you.

15:42.651 --> 15:44.733
Man: On your feet, move.
Let's go, come on.

15:44.903 --> 15:46.393
Shit.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.577
- ( explosion )
- ( all shouting)

15:56.957 --> 15:59.118
(coughing)

16:06.633 --> 16:08.589
( gunshots)

16:11.513 --> 16:13.003
Shots came
from up there.

16:13.181 --> 16:14.842
- I'm gonna check it out.
- No, l'll handle it.

16:15.016 --> 16:16.847
Sometimes biters get in
through the side fence.

16:17.018 --> 16:18.349
There's no need
for anyone to panic.

16:18.520 --> 16:20.385
Woman:
Someone help!

16:20.564 --> 16:22.555
What happened?

16:25.235 --> 16:26.566
Some guys came through
with guns.

16:26.736 --> 16:28.772
- Governor: How many?
- |-- I don't know.

16:28.947 --> 16:30.312
Well, think.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.196
Six or seven guys.
I'd never seen them before.

16:32.367 --> 16:34.449
Girl: Are we under attack?
What should we do?

16:34.619 --> 16:35.950
Hey, hey, hey.

16:36.121 --> 16:38.612
Everyone, pleasejust go home,
lock your doors, huh?

16:38.790 --> 16:40.701
We need to keep
everyone safe, okay?

16:40.876 --> 16:42.662
So just get inside,
keep your lights off.

16:42.836 --> 16:44.667
Come on.

16:44.838 --> 16:47.671
(crowd murmuring)

16:47.841 --> 16:49.172
We're under attack.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.003
You fan out and you find
these people.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.009
Don't take any chances,
try and take prisoners.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.637
You shoot to kill, huh?
Come on.

17:03.190 --> 17:05.897
Rick:
lnside, quick!

17:13.533 --> 17:16.650
- Daryl: Ain't no way out back here.
- Rick, how did you find us?

17:16.828 --> 17:18.784
- How bad are you hurt?
- I'll be all right.

17:18.955 --> 17:20.286
Where's that woman?

17:20.457 --> 17:22.994
She was right behind us.

17:25.003 --> 17:27.540
- Oscar: Maybe she was spotted.
- Daryl: Want me to go look for her?

17:27.714 --> 17:29.955
No. We gotta get them
out of here.

17:30.133 --> 17:31.839
She's on her own.

17:32.010 --> 17:36.504
Daryl, this was Merle.

17:36.681 --> 17:38.421
It was. He did this.

17:38.600 --> 17:41.808
- Rick: You saw him?
- Face to face.

17:41.978 --> 17:45.061
He threw a walker at me.
He was gonna execute us.

17:45.232 --> 17:47.564
S-so my brother's
this governor?

17:47.734 --> 17:49.474
No, he's somebody else.

17:49.653 --> 17:51.268
Your brother's
his lieutenant or something.

17:51.446 --> 17:52.856
Does he know
I'm still with you?

17:53.031 --> 17:54.896
He does now.
Rick, I'm sorry.

17:55.075 --> 17:56.406
We told him
where the prison was.

17:56.576 --> 18:00.034
- We couldn't hold out.
- Don't. No need to apologize.

18:01.498 --> 18:03.739
Maggie: They're gonna be
looking for us.

18:03.917 --> 18:06.249
We have to get back.
Can you walk?

18:06.419 --> 18:08.080
We got a car
a few miles out.

18:08.255 --> 18:09.745
- I'm good.
- All right.

18:09.923 --> 18:12.039
Daryl: Hey, if Merle's around,
I need to see him.

18:12.217 --> 18:13.673
Not now.
We're in hostile territory.

18:13.843 --> 18:15.925
- He's my brother. I ain't--
- Look at what he did!

18:16.096 --> 18:18.087
Look, we gotta-- we gotta
get out of here now.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.096
Maybe I can talk to him.
Maybe I can work something out.

18:20.267 --> 18:22.599
No, no, no.
You're not thinking straight.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.634
Look, no matter
what they say, they're hurt.

18:24.813 --> 18:26.599
Glenn can barely walk.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.479
How are we gonna
make it out

18:28.650 --> 18:29.730
if we get overrun
by walkers

18:29.901 --> 18:31.232
and this governor
catches up to us?

18:31.403 --> 18:33.485
I need you.

18:33.655 --> 18:36.442
Are you with me?

18:36.616 --> 18:38.322
Yeah.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.656
( door opens)

18:41.830 --> 18:43.240
- Any sign of them?
- Signs of what?

18:43.415 --> 18:45.076
What exactly
is happening out there?

18:45.250 --> 18:47.332
Some assholes want
what we have.

18:47.502 --> 18:48.742
Then what are we doing
waiting around here?

18:48.920 --> 18:51.377
Damn straight. Let's take these
sons of bitches out.

18:51.548 --> 18:53.209
How do we know
that the perimeter was breached?

18:53.383 --> 18:54.839
Did anyone
actually see them?

18:55.010 --> 18:57.171
- They killed Warren.
- Killed?

18:57.345 --> 19:00.633
Got up close, stuck a stake
through his neck.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.138
We need patrols now.

19:02.309 --> 19:03.890
Can't take chances
with these terrorists.

19:04.060 --> 19:06.642
You check on our people,
make sure they're safe.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.144
You want me to do
house calls,

19:08.315 --> 19:09.600
make sure everyone's
tucked in?

19:09.774 --> 19:12.356
These guys could be holed up
in one of our residences.

19:12.527 --> 19:14.483
They could be holding
someone captive or worse.

19:14.654 --> 19:15.814
Can't anyone else
handle that?

19:15.989 --> 19:17.854
I've got a hell of a lot
of experience and--

19:18.033 --> 19:19.364
Thank you.

19:19.534 --> 19:21.240
The rest of you split up.

19:21.411 --> 19:23.197
Merle will lead the search.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.117
Don't you think Haley should
handle the door-to-doors?

19:27.292 --> 19:29.078
I need someone with some authority
to provide reassurance.

19:29.252 --> 19:30.753
I mean, she'sjust a kid.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.127
These people have already killed
one man, beaten another.

19:33.298 --> 19:36.165
- I'm good with a gun--
- Just do as | ask.

19:37.552 --> 19:39.383
Sure.

20:31.398 --> 20:33.810
On three.
Stay tight.

20:33.983 --> 20:35.314
One, two, three.

20:41.658 --> 20:44.240
Man:
Hey, over there!

20:44.411 --> 20:46.242
Let's go!

20:48.248 --> 20:50.239
- There they are.
- ( gunfire )

21:12.647 --> 21:14.683
Behind you!

21:25.118 --> 21:27.109
Go! Get cover!

21:27.287 --> 21:29.323
In there.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.948
Go, go, go!

21:33.126 --> 21:36.118
- You all right?
- I saw them.

21:38.882 --> 21:40.713
- How many?
- I didn't see.

21:40.884 --> 21:42.374
Don't matter.
There's gonna be more of them.

21:42.552 --> 21:45.134
- We need to move.
— ( gunfire continues)

21:46.848 --> 21:49.339
One of them, at least.
Black guy, young.

21:49.517 --> 21:52.304
Looked like he was wearing
a prison jumpsuit.

21:52.479 --> 21:54.310
Escaped convicts.

21:54.481 --> 21:56.312
- Any grenades left?
- Uh-huh.

21:56.483 --> 21:59.145
Get 'em ready.
We gotta gun it to the wall.

22:05.033 --> 22:06.694
We gotta get
off the street.

22:06.868 --> 22:08.404
We're not soldiers,
we're survivors.

22:08.578 --> 22:09.943
We'll wait them out.

22:10.121 --> 22:12.237
- Once the smoke clears--
- Nah, they could be anywhere.

22:12.415 --> 22:14.406
- Get off the street.
- Where are you going?

22:14.584 --> 22:16.245
Get off the street.
Come on, move!

22:16.419 --> 22:17.454
Oh shit.

22:17.629 --> 22:19.494
You guys go ahead. I'm gonna
lay down some cover fire.

22:19.672 --> 22:23.256
- No, we gotta stay together.
- Too hairy. I'll be right behind you.

22:25.887 --> 22:28.344
Ready?

22:28.515 --> 22:30.881
Man: Smoke!
We got smoke!

22:33.311 --> 22:35.393
- Move!
- Let's get out of here!

22:35.563 --> 22:37.679
- Come on!
- Keep going!

22:37.857 --> 22:39.358
Oscar:
This way!

22:45.365 --> 22:47.230
Come on, now.
Come on.

23:06.928 --> 23:09.715
-Ah!
- Glenn: No!

23:21.568 --> 23:23.104
Maggie:
Rick! Rick!

23:23.278 --> 23:25.394
(Glenn yells)
Maggie!

23:25.572 --> 23:27.733
- Rick!
— ( gunfire continues)

23:27.907 --> 23:30.068
Maggie, come on.

23:39.961 --> 23:41.121
Daryl!

23:41.296 --> 23:42.911
Go!

23:50.722 --> 23:52.713
( crickets chirping )

24:01.190 --> 24:03.727
Hershel:
Finally got Judith to sleep.

24:03.901 --> 24:05.607
How are we with formula?

24:05.778 --> 24:10.272
We have enough
to last us another month.

24:12.910 --> 24:15.162
I'll take Carol for some more
at the end of the week.

24:15.330 --> 24:17.787
Your dad and the others
will be back by then.

24:19.334 --> 24:22.371
We don't know that.

24:22.545 --> 24:26.288
Right now, Judith is
the only family I got.

24:27.634 --> 24:30.296
- ( woman screaming )
- What was that?

24:30.470 --> 24:32.301
- That was from inside.
- Was that Carol?

24:32.472 --> 24:34.804
She's out keeping watch
in the guard tower with Axel.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.384
What if they came back in
for something?

24:36.559 --> 24:37.844
What if they're in trouble?

24:38.019 --> 24:39.384
Let's check the tower,
see if they're there.

24:39.562 --> 24:40.677
How could
anyone else get in?

24:40.855 --> 24:42.356
The tombs are filled
with walkers

24:42.523 --> 24:43.854
- that wandered in from outside.
- ( woman screaming )

24:44.025 --> 24:45.811
Someone else could have
done the same thing.

24:45.985 --> 24:49.022
- I'm going.
- I can't let you go down there.

24:50.406 --> 24:52.488
My father would go.

24:52.659 --> 24:55.992
(woman screaming )

24:56.162 --> 24:57.993
( door closes)

24:58.164 --> 25:01.156
(woman groaning,
screaming )

25:32.907 --> 25:36.024
(screaming continues)

25:36.202 --> 25:37.942
( rasping )

25:42.083 --> 25:44.290
(walkers snarling )

26:00.977 --> 26:02.057
Come on!

26:02.228 --> 26:04.014
Hurry!

26:16.075 --> 26:17.360
- Carl: Hurry!
- Go!

26:17.535 --> 26:19.526
- Just go.
- Let me take her.

26:19.704 --> 26:21.660
l'll cover you.

26:23.374 --> 26:24.363
Look out!

26:26.085 --> 26:28.246
- You have to leave her!
- No way!

26:40.767 --> 26:43.258
(thudding)

27:26.604 --> 27:28.469
(thudding)

27:28.648 --> 27:30.934
(snarling )

27:52.463 --> 27:54.169
Oh, my God.

27:58.094 --> 28:01.177
It's okay.

28:01.347 --> 28:03.178
I'm not gonna hurt you.

28:04.642 --> 28:07.008
Come on, come on.
That's it.

28:21.242 --> 28:23.233
(snarling )

28:27.039 --> 28:29.030
No!

28:33.045 --> 28:34.546
Don't hurt her.

28:39.302 --> 28:41.463
Look.Hey.

28:41.637 --> 28:43.377
Look.

28:50.062 --> 28:52.394
It's me you want.

28:57.486 --> 29:00.944
There's no need
for her to suffer.

29:01.115 --> 29:03.276
She doesn't have needs.

29:08.122 --> 29:11.080
Don't hurt my little girl.

29:14.921 --> 29:17.082
Please don't.

29:21.928 --> 29:23.759
No!

29:30.519 --> 29:32.259
( roaring )

29:40.696 --> 29:43.779
Ah!

29:47.119 --> 29:49.235
(yells)

29:52.208 --> 29:54.199
(yells)

29:55.962 --> 29:57.873
(yelling)

30:01.258 --> 30:03.294
(coughing)

30:13.479 --> 30:14.810
No!

30:14.981 --> 30:16.972
Ow! Oh!

30:17.149 --> 30:20.141
(panting, coughing)

30:37.336 --> 30:39.418
Ah!

30:42.800 --> 30:44.631
(screaming )

30:48.597 --> 30:51.339
No!

30:58.232 --> 31:00.564
What have you done?

31:43.110 --> 31:45.726
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

31:45.905 --> 31:48.738
- ( crying )
- Here, here.

32:09.595 --> 32:12.587
(sobbing )

32:26.570 --> 32:29.528
(sobbing )
She killed my baby.

32:31.367 --> 32:33.232
She killed my baby.
She killed her.

32:39.959 --> 32:43.042
Allen:
Oh, God! Donna?

32:43.212 --> 32:44.543
Is she dead?

32:44.713 --> 32:46.840
Is she dead? Baby?

32:51.095 --> 32:53.711
(crying)

32:53.889 --> 32:56.050
- I'll take care of it.
- ( gun cocks )

32:56.225 --> 32:57.931
Whoa!

32:58.102 --> 32:59.467
Whoa, kid.
Wait a minute.

32:59.645 --> 33:01.886
- She doesn't have that long.
- Who the hell are you?

33:02.064 --> 33:04.020
How did you get in here?
Who are you with?

33:04.191 --> 33:05.806
Look, we can help you.

33:05.985 --> 33:07.316
First things first.

33:07.486 --> 33:10.193
No, we take care
of our own.

33:14.160 --> 33:15.991
- No, Tyreese!
- I gotta do it.

33:16.162 --> 33:18.153
Look, just take Ben
and lean against the wall.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.321
It'll be quick.

33:27.548 --> 33:29.880
It's okay. It's okay.

33:39.852 --> 33:41.968
( door closes)

33:42.146 --> 33:44.683
- Hey, what are you doing?
- ( keysjingle)

33:47.067 --> 33:50.525
- Kid, did you just lock us in here?
- Open the door.

33:50.696 --> 33:52.778
This room is secure.
You'll be safe.

33:52.948 --> 33:54.449
You have food and water.

33:58.996 --> 34:01.362
- Open this door.
- I can't.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.246
Come on, man.
We're not animals.

34:03.417 --> 34:05.533
Don't do this.

34:07.504 --> 34:08.584
- Hey!
-( bangs)

34:08.756 --> 34:10.087
You can'tjust
leave us in here!

34:10.257 --> 34:12.964
- Open this door! Open it! Now!
- ( bangs )

34:13.135 --> 34:15.547
Sasha!

34:15.721 --> 34:19.589
Back away from their door
and let the man go.

34:25.564 --> 34:28.306
Look around you.

34:28.484 --> 34:31.726
This is the best
we've had it in weeks.

34:31.904 --> 34:35.146
His house.

34:38.244 --> 34:40.735
We got other things to do.

34:44.333 --> 34:46.244
We don't want any trouble.

34:53.092 --> 34:56.926
- Shouldn't we help them?
- I did.

35:01.058 --> 35:02.764
It doesn't look good.

35:02.935 --> 35:05.972
The glass has done
a lot of damage.

35:06.146 --> 35:07.932
I need to get out of here.

35:08.107 --> 35:10.439
- Not yet.
- Get out of my way!

35:10.609 --> 35:13.100
Can you give us a minute?

35:22.955 --> 35:24.820
What the hell was that?

35:24.999 --> 35:27.411
Why was she here?

35:27.584 --> 35:30.075
Why were you fighting her?

35:30.254 --> 35:31.869
She came back to kill me.

35:32.047 --> 35:35.380
- Why?
- You tell me.

35:37.011 --> 35:39.252
You knew her.

35:41.640 --> 35:45.303
The fish tanks, the heads?

35:45.477 --> 35:48.969
I made myself look at them.

35:49.148 --> 35:52.481
Prepared me for
the horrors outside.

35:55.863 --> 35:57.854
And Penny?

36:08.125 --> 36:09.661
Oh, my God.

36:09.835 --> 36:12.247
ljust heard.
Are you all right?

36:12.421 --> 36:14.707
- Your eye, is it--
- ( door opens)

36:18.344 --> 36:19.834
What happened to you?

36:26.352 --> 36:28.434
l was attacked.

36:28.604 --> 36:30.060
Merle:
They made it over the wall.

36:30.230 --> 36:32.937
I'll go after them
in the morning.

36:46.288 --> 36:47.869
Get down.

36:50.793 --> 36:52.784
(coughs, grunts)

36:56.715 --> 36:58.046
Come on, Daryl.

36:58.217 --> 37:00.333
( rustling )

37:03.430 --> 37:05.887
- Rick: Where the hell were you?
- ( gun cocks )

37:06.058 --> 37:09.050
Put your hands up.

37:09.228 --> 37:11.594
Turn around.
Turn around.

37:27.079 --> 37:28.910
Get what you came for?

37:29.081 --> 37:30.992
Where are the rest
of your people?

37:31.166 --> 37:32.417
They got Oscar.

37:32.584 --> 37:33.994
Daryl is missing.
You didn't see him?

37:34.169 --> 37:35.750
If anything happens to him--

37:35.921 --> 37:39.004
I brought you here
to save them.

37:40.843 --> 37:43.209
Thanks for the help.

37:43.387 --> 37:46.971
You'll need help to get them back
to the prison

37:47.141 --> 37:49.427
or to go back
in there for Daryl.

37:49.601 --> 37:53.935
Either way, you need me.

38:00.946 --> 38:02.937
( chatter)

38:24.303 --> 38:26.134
( chatter stops )

38:33.270 --> 38:35.352
What can I say?

38:40.068 --> 38:41.569
Hasn't been
a night like this

38:41.737 --> 38:44.069
since the walls
were completed.

38:47.367 --> 38:49.858
And I thought
we were past it--

38:52.998 --> 38:58.368
past the days
when we all sat,

38:58.545 --> 39:02.288
huddled, scared
in front of the TV

39:02.466 --> 39:05.458
during the early days
of the outbreak.

39:08.430 --> 39:11.513
The fear we all felt then,

39:11.683 --> 39:14.220
we felt it again tonight.

39:19.066 --> 39:21.057
I failed you.

39:24.488 --> 39:26.900
I promised to keep you safe.

39:29.368 --> 39:31.700
Hell, look at me.

39:36.625 --> 39:38.991
You know, |--

39:39.169 --> 39:42.787
I should tell you
that we'll be okay,

39:42.965 --> 39:45.707
that we're safe,

39:45.884 --> 39:48.546
that tomorrow we'll bury
our dead and endure,

39:48.720 --> 39:51.302
but |-- I won't,

39:51.473 --> 39:53.384
because I can't.

39:55.018 --> 39:58.226
Because I'm afraid.

39:58.397 --> 40:00.388
That's right.

40:02.484 --> 40:08.229
I'm afraid of terrorists
who want what we have.

40:08.407 --> 40:11.570
Want to destroy us!

40:11.743 --> 40:13.734
And worse...

40:21.503 --> 40:22.913
is one of our own.

40:23.088 --> 40:26.421
(crowd murmuring)

40:26.592 --> 40:29.584
- Merle...
- ( crowd muttering )

40:29.761 --> 40:33.674
the man I counted on,

40:33.849 --> 40:37.091
the man I trusted.

40:37.269 --> 40:40.761
He led 'em here.

40:40.939 --> 40:43.146
And he let 'em in.

40:48.905 --> 40:50.281
It was you.

40:50.449 --> 40:51.780
You lied,

40:51.950 --> 40:54.362
betrayed us all.

41:04.880 --> 41:09.294
This is one
of the terrorists.

41:13.805 --> 41:16.262
Merle's own brother.

41:29.237 --> 41:31.273
So what should we do
with them, huh?

41:31.448 --> 41:34.861
- Crowd: Kill them!
- What?

41:35.035 --> 41:38.198
- What you want?
- Crowd: Kill them!

41:45.420 --> 41:48.332
( crowd chanting )
Kill them!

41:59.184 --> 42:02.642
You wanted your brother.

42:02.813 --> 42:05.350
Now you got him.

42:22.958 --> 42:23.037
