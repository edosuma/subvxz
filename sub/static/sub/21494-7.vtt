WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:05.000
Hey,right now is "Impracticalne. Jokers: After Party."

00:05.000 --> 00:06.000
We've got Murr and special guest,

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
"Daily Show" correspondent Roy Wood Jr.

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
and, the most-hated man in baseball, Joe,

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
and it all happens right now.

00:13.000 --> 00:17.000
[ Applause ]

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
That's right, everybody!

00:18.000 --> 00:21.000
We're here at the Flagship Brewery in Staten Island, New York,

00:21.000 --> 00:22.000
and joining me today to talk about the show

00:23.000 --> 00:24.000
are two of the stars of "Impractical Jokers,"

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
Joe and Murr. Hi, Joe! How are you?

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
[ Applause ] That's right! They're so polite.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
You can yell and scream if you want, too.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
It's okay. You can, "Whoo!"

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
[ Cheers and applause ] There we go.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.000
Doesn't that feel better? It's like --

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
There's no making me feel better after tonight, okay?

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
Rewatching that -- -You had a tough time.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
We definitely will touch on that, and we'll get into that later.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
But, of course, you know, we saw a lot of different things that happened,

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
'cause you do locations a lot of place like Universal,

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
and you did, of course, the water parks.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Yes, yes, the water parks -- Volcano Bay.

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
But, you know, how is it to really be out there?

00:57.000 --> 00:59.000
This one had to deal with water and a water park.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Yeah. How was that? Real quick. Touch on that.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Water parks often have to deal with water.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.000
Yes, that's correct. -Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Water parks are strange places...

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
-Yeah. They smell strange. -...strange places.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
But do you like going to water parks?

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
-Oh, I did until Mexico, 2004. -Really, why? Do tell.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
[ Chuckles ] "There I was, Mexico!"

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
I was in Mexico, 2004 --

01:18.000 --> 01:21.000
It was my mother's, God rest her soul, 65th birthday,

01:22.000 --> 01:23.000
so we decided to take everybody, right?

01:23.000 --> 01:27.000
You took your mother to a water park on her 65th birthday?

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
You know my mother. She was the one who wanted to go, right?

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
So my nephew at the time, Anthony, he's 8 years old,

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
and he wants to go on this big slide,

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
but everybody's afraid to, but he really wants to go.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
His father says, "Take him."

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
So I go to the top of the water slide,

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
and the guy's like, "Sí," and I'm like, "Sí."

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
No one speaks English. I don't speak Spanish.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
It's not a good mix. I'm like, "Do we go together?"

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
And he doesn't know what I'm saying.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
We have one raft, my nephew goes, and I sit there,

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
and I turn to talk to him to see if we're okay to go,

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
and I look back and my nephew is gone.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
He is started down the water slide.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
He's 8 years old, doesn't know how to swim.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.000
So I'm like, "Oh, I'm going."

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
So I  ándale  down the water slide, and I'm chasing him.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
I was trying to get tight, and I'm --

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
You're like a bobsled chasing --

02:02.000 --> 02:05.000
He's just out of reach, and now everybody's down at the bottom

02:05.000 --> 02:07.000
waiting for him to come down like, "Yay!"

02:07.000 --> 02:09.000
He's gonna come out by himself, so I'm trying to pick up speed,

02:09.000 --> 02:10.000
I'm blowing the belly out.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.000
I finally get him right before the end, grab him,

02:13.000 --> 02:16.000
and put him on the raft just at the moment -- Really?

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
Yeah, and we get out of the water, and he's like,

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
"Again, again," and I'm like, "No, no."

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
It was funny, when they made me go skydiving,

02:23.000 --> 02:25.000
you dive out of the plane tandem

02:25.000 --> 02:26.000
with a professional on your back.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
And I said to him -- I was like,

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
"Look, if this goes wrong and somehow we get separated,

02:30.000 --> 02:32.000
my cord come undone from you,

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
do you do what they do in the movies?

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
Do you go into a bullet shape and chase me,

02:37.000 --> 02:39.000
capture me, and pull the rip cord?"

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
He goes, "No, no, no.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
First rule of skydiving is, 'Every man for himself.'"

02:42.000 --> 02:46.000
I was like, "That's the rule?! That's not a rule!"

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
So, obviously, the terrified look on your face

02:48.000 --> 02:49.000
was completely genuine.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.000
What I'm saying is, I wish I had you as my tandem instructor.

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
That's right. That's right

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
All right. Well, in the first challenge,

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
the guys had to complete an unusual task

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
at Universal's, of course, new Volcano Bay.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
You had to go, and you had to honk people.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
You were honking people in this episode?

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
I had to honk pectorals.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
How was -- How was -- Was that a little nerve-racking?

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Because... -You know.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
...obviously, you can't do that to a woman.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.000
So I'm choosing guys, and if a guy has prominent pectorals,

03:12.000 --> 03:14.000
he's probably stronger than me.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
And were the reactions pretty, like,

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
"What the hell are you doing?" or very shocked about it?

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
You know what? We always say this --

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
it surprises me still to this day

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
how few times we've gotten assaulted, you know?

03:23.000 --> 03:25.000
It just doesn't happen much. [ Laughter ]

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Now, eating sand wasn't the first time

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
the Jokers had to convince strangers to do crazy stuff,

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
so let's take a look at some of those best moments.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
How do you get somebody to lay down on the floor in a mall?

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Good luck to you, man.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
-No. -Just real quick.

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
I can't believe this! Look at that!

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Spoon with me, dude!

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
-Okay, come on. -He's doing it! He's doing it!

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
Take a puppy out of the cage and smell its ass.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.000
No, you just -- [ sniffing ] You make sure you know.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
They have different smells. Go ahead.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.000
-[ Sniffs ] -Oh!

03:54.000 --> 03:55.000
[ Sniffs ]

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
-Here you go, man. -Oh, this is crazy.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.000
Reach out and take that. There you go. Sweet.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Oh, my God!

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
Can I kiss your abs?

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
For one second, can I kiss your abs?

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
-Okay. -I can't believe this.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
Joe: Oh! [ Laughter ]

04:11.000 --> 04:12.000
I will go to clip your toenails.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Just one. Let me see it.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.000
[ Squeals ] I can't believe this!

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
[ Laughter ] Oh, my God!

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
Tax that ass! Tax that ass!

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Whose ass?! That ass!

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
-Whose ass?! -That ass!

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
Murr: They're two grown men sleeping on each other in the park.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.000
Sal: I've never seen this in my life.

04:29.000 --> 04:32.000
Do you enjoy Keanu Reeves as a performer?

04:32.000 --> 04:33.000
Get that mic lower and lower, buddy.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.000
-Into the mic. -Oh.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.000
Yes. Yes, I do. [ Laughter ]

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
Friday night, IKEA pillow fight. Let's do this dance.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
Do it! Do it! Do it!

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
[ Laughter ]

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
-Oh! -What the [bleep]

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
See if you can get him to drop his pants.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.000
Get them down, sit. Go ahead -- wow.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
Ah!

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Do you think the "Lethal Weapon" movies should be remade?

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
Uh, they shouldn't be remade, because...

05:03.000 --> 05:06.000
[ Laughter ]

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
...taking stuff out and revamping it again.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Nothing original. -Great. Thank you so much.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
And this is James Murray reporting from Screen Gab

05:13.000 --> 05:14.000
with my new friend. [ Applause ]

05:15.000 --> 05:19.000
I still can't believe how people actually do stuff like that.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
I mean, for you, obviously, of course, you saw those.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
Was one of those one of your favorite ones that you guys have done?

05:24.000 --> 05:26.000
I mean, starting a massive pillow fight

05:26.000 --> 05:28.000
was probably still one of my favorite moments.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
I couldn't believe that  that happened.  It's everyone's dream.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
You go to IKEA, you're shopping in Furniture,

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
you start a massive pillow fight.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.000
-I do that on the regular now. -Yeah.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Anyway, our after party has just begun,

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
and we have a lot more to discuss,

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
a lot more surprises, and exclusive bonus content

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
that you've never seen anywhere but here.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
Stay right where you are. -"After Party."

05:45.000 --> 05:47.000
[ Cheers and applause ]

05:52.000 --> 05:55.000
[ Cheers and applause ]

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Welcome back to "Impractical Jokers: After Party."

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
I'm here with Joe, and nobody cares about Murr,

05:59.000 --> 06:01.000
and we're talking about all tonight's episode.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
-I care about Murr. -I care about Murr, too.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
-Yes. -I don't.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
[ Laughter ] Anywa--

06:06.000 --> 06:07.000
We do love you. I'm just busting your chops.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.000
-I love you, too, buddy. -Sort of.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Anyway, so we'll get back into this discussion

06:11.000 --> 06:12.000
about, like, traveling.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.000
I mean, you guys do travel a lot now.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
First, I mean, of course,

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
when nobody really recognized you in that sense,

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
you were doing stuff locally, of course, in New York City,

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
but now things have branched out

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
to where a lot of people are starting to know you.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
We've been all over the place. Texas.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
-Texas, we did a cruise, Miami. -London.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
-New Orleans. -New Orleans.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
-Hawaii. -Hawaii.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.000
-Of course, Universal Studios. -Universal Studios.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.000
-The Moon. -The Moon.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.000
[ Laughter ] But it's funny.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
You guys obviously have a great time, you know, traveling,

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
but is it harder because of the fact

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
that there are sometimes places where there's time changes

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
and you got to just be on game, on point?

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
I mean, does it get tiresome or difficult?

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Well, when we did the Hawaii episode,

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
I lost four days of my life when I came back.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.000
Because I brought my wife and my daughter with me,

06:52.000 --> 06:54.000
and she just started to wake up at like 3:00 A.M.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
and want ice cream, so we were doing that for four days.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
That was fun. And then Murray would call me at 3:00 A.M.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
and be like, "Hey, you having ice cream? Can I come over?"

07:01.000 --> 07:02.000
And Murray would come over.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.000
Where else am I gonna get ice cream at 3:00 in the morning?

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
-You know I have it. -Right.

07:06.000 --> 07:07.000
Would you say when you're traveling, of course,

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
who is, like, the worst person to travel with?

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
On three.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
Both: One, two, three. Sal. [ Laughter ]

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
Whenever you say, "Who is the worst...?" and leave a blank,

07:16.000 --> 07:18.000
the answer, 99.9% of the time --

07:18.000 --> 07:20.000
We check in to a hotel, like, on tour. We tour every week.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
-He's got the worst luck. -Oh, my God.

07:22.000 --> 07:25.000
If anything could go wrong, it happens to Sal.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
He checks in the hotel, his room is the one that's not ready.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.000
You know what I mean? He finally gets in his room, nothing works --

07:30.000 --> 07:33.000
the air-conditioner's broke, there's things off the walls.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
What about the -- He checked in to a full-blown --

07:35.000 --> 07:36.000
It felt like a crime scene.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
We were touring, and he goes into his room.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
I think we're in Iowa or something.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
And there was literally a hole in the sheetrock,

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
a turned-over lamp, and some blood on the rug.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
He called me. He thought I did it.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
He's like, "What'd you do to my room?!"

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
I said, "I didn't do nothing to your room."

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
He's like, "I think I checked in to a crime scene."

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
And what are the best, actually, experiences that you had traveling?

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
Of course, we talked about the funny part and the worst --

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
When we do these travel episodes,
