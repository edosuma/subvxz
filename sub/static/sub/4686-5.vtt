<i>So here's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee.

00:00.982 --> 00:02.883
<i>Will made the Glee Club decide</i>
<i>whether they were Katys</i>

00:02.917 --> 00:04.818
<i>or Gagas as if those were</i>
<i>the only two options,</i>

00:04.853 --> 00:07.354
<i>which Sue thought was stupid so</i>
<i>now she's got it out for them</i>

00:07.388 --> 00:09.122
<i>but this time she's principal</i>
<i>and Becky's her Beckretary.</i>

00:09.157 --> 00:11.458
Oh snap! <i>Jake wanted to
go all the way with Marley,</i>

00:11.492 --> 00:12.960
<i>but Marley only let him</i>
<i>touch her boob,</i>

00:12.994 --> 00:14.761
<i>so Jake cheated on her</i>
<i>with demon hellspawn Bree</i>

00:14.796 --> 00:17.097
<i>'cause that's the kind of guy</i>
<i>he is and Marley doesn't know.</i>

00:17.131 --> 00:19.600
- Do you want to go somewhere?
- Is your girlfriend going to be there?

00:19.634 --> 00:21.594
<i>Rachel got the lead</i>
<i>in</i> Funny Girl <i>on Broadway, but</i>

00:21.603 --> 00:23.704
<i>the director's sort of weird</i>
<i>and has crazy eyes and wasn't</i>

00:23.738 --> 00:25.839
<i>even sure she was right</i>
<i>for the part to begin with.</i>

00:25.874 --> 00:27.207
That's all we needed to see.

00:27.242 --> 00:28.603
<i>And that's what you missed</i>
<i>on</i> Glee.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074

00:47.717 --> 00:50.552
Blaine, what are you doing?

00:50.587 --> 00:51.787
Tina! Tina, get out!

00:51.821 --> 00:53.122
Get out! Get out of here!

00:58.361 --> 01:00.462
Get out! Get out!
Get out of here!

01:00.497 --> 01:02.197
Blaine this is nothing
to be embarrassed about.

01:02.232 --> 01:03.365
Yes, it is.

01:03.400 --> 01:05.968
That's a twerk fail
gawker nightmare.

01:06.736 --> 01:08.570
No. This is a revelation.

01:08.605 --> 01:10.672
If this is turning into
what I think it's turning into,

01:10.707 --> 01:11.874
I just want to say

01:11.908 --> 01:13.342
that it's physically impossible
for me to twerk.

01:13.376 --> 01:14.443
I beg to differ.

01:14.477 --> 01:16.412
Guys, look how you're
all riveted by that video.

01:16.446 --> 01:18.881
That's the kind of reaction
we need from the judges if we're

01:18.915 --> 01:20.449
gonna one-up Throat Explosion
at nationals.

01:20.483 --> 01:23.051
We need to edge up our America's
sweetheart image a bit.

01:23.086 --> 01:25.854
Show the judges that
we're not afraid to rebel.

01:25.889 --> 01:28.190
Mr. Shue, what if some of us
don't know how to twerk?

01:28.224 --> 01:31.093
Have no fear,
your twerk-torial is here.

01:31.127 --> 01:34.263
Hey, and if you can all dance
like Blaine did in that video,

01:34.297 --> 01:36.064
we are gonna need
a bigger trophy case.

01:36.099 --> 01:38.100
Yeah, twerk, twerk!

01:40.970 --> 01:43.772
Twerk, twerk!
Watch this, Marley.

01:46.843 --> 01:50.078
Okay, listen up.
Twerking did start in Atlanta

01:50.113 --> 01:52.448
in the club scene,
but it is global now.

01:52.482 --> 01:54.616
And whether you call it
the booty pop or P-pop

01:54.651 --> 01:57.820
or the Sissy Bounce,
all that you need to do it is...

01:57.854 --> 02:00.956
a working booty and the right
attitude and education.

02:00.990 --> 02:03.125
So we'll start
with the basics. Kitty?

02:03.159 --> 02:06.161
All right, you basic bitches,
feet should-width apart.

02:06.196 --> 02:09.031
Bend your knees, turn them out,
hands on hips,

02:09.065 --> 02:10.632
thumbs on the butt.

02:10.667 --> 02:15.337
And pop it, pop it, pop it,
pop it, pop it, pop it.

02:20.143 --> 02:21.443
Not that.
This is so weird!

02:21.478 --> 02:23.412
Unique, come on!
You are a natural.

02:23.446 --> 02:27.249
I been twerking in my bedroom
since I was six to Miss Beyoncé.

02:27.283 --> 02:28.784
Hey, Sam.

02:28.818 --> 02:31.753
Yeah, that was a White Chocolate
signature move.

02:31.788 --> 02:35.357
Tina and Ryder,
you'll be twerking in the back.

02:35.391 --> 02:38.360
Stay very, very loose.

02:44.934 --> 02:46.902
I need a transformation.

02:46.936 --> 02:50.105
To shed some old skin.

02:50.139 --> 02:52.941
I want to look
completely different.

02:52.976 --> 02:54.910
Hi.

02:54.944 --> 02:58.113
Okay. Today it's
"You are Woman, I am Man."

02:58.147 --> 03:00.749
I have some ideas, but I want to
see what you do with it first.

03:00.783 --> 03:03.118
All I know is I want
the sexual organs

03:03.152 --> 03:04.253
of every man, woman, and well,

03:04.287 --> 03:05.521
just the men and women,

03:05.555 --> 03:07.489
to be stimulated
by the end of this number.

03:07.524 --> 03:10.459
I think we can handle that.

03:16.633 --> 03:18.834
This is a joke, right?

03:18.868 --> 03:21.103
I did some research, and I
wanted to get into character,

03:21.137 --> 03:23.205
and this cut and length
was totally in style

03:23.239 --> 03:24.339
in post-World War I Manhattan.

03:24.374 --> 03:27.309
Do you have any idea
how Broadway works?

03:27.343 --> 03:28.977
Read your contract.

03:29.012 --> 03:33.081
I pick every swatch, every gel,
every shade of lipstick.

03:33.116 --> 03:34.983
Anything the audience
will see, hear or smell

03:35.018 --> 03:38.387
in my theater is selected
after weeks

03:38.421 --> 03:41.523
of careful consideration
by me, the director.

03:41.558 --> 03:43.492
Look, I'm not a prop,
all right?

03:43.526 --> 03:46.161
You hired me to express
myself, to be Fanny, my fanny.

03:46.195 --> 03:48.897
And I need some freedom
to be able to find her myself.

03:48.932 --> 03:50.933
And someone told you
she hangs out

03:50.967 --> 03:52.401
in Sally Hershberger Downtown?

03:52.435 --> 03:54.603
Look, I've sort of been going
through hell

03:54.637 --> 03:56.204
the past month or so.

03:56.239 --> 03:58.407
And I just needed
to snap out of it.

03:58.441 --> 04:00.108
So maybe we could
just do the number

04:00.143 --> 04:01.610
and see how it goes from there.

04:01.644 --> 04:04.980
Fine, Rachel.

God bless the haircut!

06:39.602 --> 06:42.370
It's like some kind
of reverse Samson.

06:42.405 --> 06:45.807
I have some notes, but you
really were our Fanny up there.

06:45.842 --> 06:47.609
Okay. Well, you know,
Fanny was a rebel.

06:47.643 --> 06:50.123
So I just felt a little rebellious
behavior would do the trick.

06:50.146 --> 06:51.413
You were right.

06:51.447 --> 06:53.915
But I think we've all rebelled
enough for one production.

06:53.950 --> 06:55.050
No more, understood?

06:55.084 --> 06:56.051
Yes, sir.

06:56.085 --> 06:58.053
From the top!

07:03.826 --> 07:06.795
And the right to vote
was in 18...

07:06.829 --> 07:08.029
Mr. Shue?
Yes?

07:08.064 --> 07:10.332
May I be excused?
Too much Diet Coke.

07:10.366 --> 07:11.833
Yeah.

07:11.868 --> 07:14.169
There you go.

07:21.010 --> 07:22.310
Excuse me.

07:22.345 --> 07:24.546
What the hell are you
doing in here?

07:24.580 --> 07:25.647
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:25.681 --> 07:27.649
I'm sorry, I thought this was
the little boys' room.

07:27.683 --> 07:29.951
Stop right there, voice of Elmo.

07:29.986 --> 07:31.119
Do you honestly expect me

07:31.154 --> 07:33.188
to believe you stumbled
in here by accident?

07:33.222 --> 07:34.856
Please don't tell anyone.

07:34.891 --> 07:36.525
I'm afraid to use
the boys' bathroom.

07:36.559 --> 07:38.293
I can't. I just don't feel
comfortable in there.

07:38.327 --> 07:40.395
I make sure to only come
in here during class

07:40.429 --> 07:42.030
so no one finds out
or gets upset.

07:42.064 --> 07:45.667
Oh. Don't worry.

07:45.701 --> 07:47.669
Your secret's safe with me.

07:47.703 --> 07:50.639
<i>And that's how
it all started...</i>

07:50.673 --> 07:53.809
<i>the Great McKinley Bathroom</i>
<i>Gender Riot of 2013.</i>

07:55.111 --> 07:57.879
<i>Bree figured out that the boys'</i>
<i>room was a great place</i>

07:57.914 --> 07:59.681
<i>to make out in</i>
<i>and not get caught.</i>

07:59.715 --> 08:02.017
You've been avoiding me.

08:06.923 --> 08:08.356
Whoa.

08:08.391 --> 08:10.192
<i>Stoner Brett started using</i>
<i>the girls' bathroom</i>

08:10.226 --> 08:11.927
<i>because it was cleaner</i>
<i>and it smelled better,</i>

08:11.961 --> 08:14.496
<i>and he heard a rumor that</i>
<i>the toilet seats were heated.</i>

08:14.530 --> 08:17.432
<i>And then the girls started</i>
<i>using the boys' room</i>

08:17.466 --> 08:21.369
<i>when they realized that boys</i>
<i>never had to wait in a line.</i>

08:26.609 --> 08:27.709
<i>It was chaos.</i>

08:34.517 --> 08:36.351
Whoops.

08:39.688 --> 08:41.323
I just had

08:41.357 --> 08:43.424
the most incredible
experience of my life.

08:43.458 --> 08:45.493
Oh, my God.
Did you cut your hair?

08:45.528 --> 08:46.995
I was feeling stuck.

08:49.031 --> 08:50.599
Oh.

08:50.633 --> 08:51.800
You know, Rupert's amazing,

08:51.834 --> 08:53.535
but he has such specific views
on everything.

08:53.569 --> 08:55.503
And it's not like
I don't trust his vision,

08:55.538 --> 08:58.073
but I felt like I needed
to just rebel a little bit

08:58.107 --> 08:59.774
in order to have
more room to play.

08:59.809 --> 09:01.376
So he doesn't know that
you were wearing a wig?

09:01.410 --> 09:03.144
Not at first, but then
I told him after rehearsal.

09:03.179 --> 09:04.713
And he really loved it,
and I might get

09:04.747 --> 09:07.616
- to wear it in the show. - What if he
got mad about you lying to him?

09:07.650 --> 09:10.418
Or-or what if he saw that you cut
your hair and sent you packing?

09:10.453 --> 09:12.754
Okay, you know what, Kurt?
You've become boring.

09:12.788 --> 09:15.824
You go to class, and then you come
home and you watch your stories

09:15.858 --> 09:18.026
and eat on this food
and you Skype with Blaine,

09:18.060 --> 09:19.194
and it's not even sexy Skyping.

09:19.228 --> 09:20.896
I know this
because you just go to sleep.

09:20.930 --> 09:23.098
Same thing every day.

09:23.132 --> 09:25.467
- I change up my afternoon
smoothie occasionally. - You know,

09:25.501 --> 09:27.869
it felt so good taking
a risk with this wig.

09:27.904 --> 09:29.671
It's, like, I just...
I felt so alive.

09:29.705 --> 09:32.774
And I know I could have messed
everything up, but I didn't even care.

09:32.808 --> 09:34.776
It's, like, I just
wanted to risk it all.

09:34.810 --> 09:36.778
- What's gotten into you? - I don't know.
But do you remember

09:36.812 --> 09:38.346
in high school,
everything felt so urgent?

09:38.381 --> 09:41.149
Like if we didn't just go for it
we'd lose our chance forever?

09:41.183 --> 09:42.918
Yes, it was very stressful.

09:42.952 --> 09:44.586
I want to feel that way again.

09:45.621 --> 09:48.156
Does this have something
to do with Finn?

09:49.492 --> 09:51.860
You know, if part
of my grieving process

09:51.894 --> 09:55.163
is just diving headfirst
into life, then... maybe.

09:56.198 --> 09:58.967
All right, Rachel Berry...

09:59.001 --> 10:00.402
you got me.

10:00.436 --> 10:02.504
Let's go out
and do something crazy.

10:02.538 --> 10:04.973
Like what? Let's go use
flash photography at the Met.

10:05.007 --> 10:06.675
Small potatoes.
How about we break out

10:06.709 --> 10:08.743
the bottle of limoncello
you've been saving up.

10:08.778 --> 10:09.978
What for?

10:10.012 --> 10:12.213
Anesthesia.

10:14.362 --> 10:17.157
Both orangutans have been
charged with solicitation

10:17.192 --> 10:19.893
and impersonating
a police officer.

10:19.928 --> 10:23.197
Prosecutors say both
Tickles and Bam-Bam

10:23.231 --> 10:26.000
will be tried as adults.

10:26.034 --> 10:28.769
And now let's stroll
on down to Sue's Corner,

10:28.803 --> 10:33.240
with cheerleading icon,
Principal Sue Sylvester.

10:33.274 --> 10:35.309
Thank you, Rod. Andrea.

10:35.343 --> 10:36.577
America,

10:36.611 --> 10:39.146
tonight I address
a nation at war.

10:39.180 --> 10:42.182
Now, I'm not referring to
Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad,

10:42.217 --> 10:45.252
who gassed his own people
when they began to make fun

10:45.286 --> 10:47.254
of his extremely hilarious lisp.

10:47.288 --> 10:50.891
No, this nation faces
a far more insidious foe:

10:50.925 --> 10:52.793
Miley Cyrus...

10:52.827 --> 10:56.096
and the genital-flapping dance
known as "twerking"

10:56.131 --> 10:58.732
that makes men and women alike
look like overgrown,

10:58.767 --> 11:00.801
constipated toddlers.

11:00.835 --> 11:02.369
This vulgar,

11:02.404 --> 11:04.271
sexually explicit
excuse for a dance craze

11:04.305 --> 11:06.640
has brought American culture
to a new low.

11:06.674 --> 11:09.843
And that's why tonight,
Western Ohio,

11:09.878 --> 11:12.846
I solemnly pledge to end
the pandemic of twerking

11:12.881 --> 11:14.214
once and for all.

11:14.249 --> 11:16.850
Not only will I outlaw twerking
at McKinley High,

11:16.885 --> 11:20.020
but I have submitted a bill
to the Ohio State Legislature

11:20.055 --> 11:22.956
banning twerking
in Ohio public schools.

11:22.991 --> 11:24.558
And Hannah Montana

11:24.592 --> 11:27.928
can go back to naked-straddling
the three-ton wrecking ball

11:27.962 --> 11:29.863
she was clearly upsold
at Home Depot,

11:29.898 --> 11:32.866
as the tiny cinderblock room
she's elected to demolish

11:32.901 --> 11:34.334
is only about 12 square feet

11:34.369 --> 11:35.903
and already has a wall missing.

11:35.937 --> 11:37.738
And that's how Sue

11:37.772 --> 11:40.374
sees it.

11:40.408 --> 11:41.708
Ron.

11:41.743 --> 11:43.377
Oo-hoo, Sue!

11:43.411 --> 11:44.845
You're outta sight.

11:44.879 --> 11:46.847
We'll be right back.

11:48.783 --> 11:51.418
She will not
get away with this...

11:51.453 --> 11:52.586
- Guys, guys! What's going on?
- Did you not see.

11:52.620 --> 11:54.421
Principal Sylvester's
latest "Sue's Corner"?

11:54.456 --> 11:55.889
She's trying to take away
our God-given right

11:55.924 --> 11:57.291
to twerk, Mr. Shue,
it's bullcrap!

11:57.325 --> 11:58.492
I think what we're all
feeling, Mr. Shue,

11:58.526 --> 11:59.493
is that we were really
onto something

11:59.527 --> 12:01.161
with this whole twerking
at nationals thing...

12:01.196 --> 12:03.263
I completely agree with you.

12:03.298 --> 12:05.165
Principal Sylvester is drawing
a line in the sand.

12:05.200 --> 12:07.101
She's deciding what's acceptable
and what's not,

12:07.135 --> 12:08.469
and that's just not gonna stand.

12:08.503 --> 12:10.771
The fact is, twerking is about

12:10.805 --> 12:13.006
blurring the lines, between
the past and the present,

12:13.041 --> 12:14.708
between men and women,

12:14.742 --> 12:16.710
between tradition
and envelope-pushing!

12:16.744 --> 12:19.079
It's all in that
Alan Thicke song that I love.

12:19.114 --> 12:21.148
- "Blurred Lines" by <i>Robin</i> Thicke?
- Exactly.

12:21.182 --> 12:22.583
That's not what
that song's about.

12:22.617 --> 12:24.885
Sue Sylvester wants to draw
a line in the sand?

12:24.919 --> 12:26.019
Well, we're gonna blur it.

12:26.054 --> 12:27.688
And blow this debate wide open!

12:27.722 --> 12:28.755
Yeah!

You do realize
that "Blurred Lines"

14:51.332 --> 14:53.367
is a song about
date rape, don't you?

14:53.401 --> 14:54.701
What?

14:54.736 --> 14:56.203
- No, it's not.
- Will...

14:56.237 --> 14:58.277
you need to "back your ass
up" to the fact that you,

14:58.306 --> 14:59.806
a married 37-year-old,

14:59.841 --> 15:02.876
just performed a song about
coercive sexual advances

15:02.910 --> 15:05.712
as nine minors
twerked alongside you

15:05.747 --> 15:07.547
down the hallways of
a public high school.

15:07.582 --> 15:09.416
It's called
the First Amendment, Sue.

15:09.450 --> 15:10.751
This is about
freedom of expression.

15:10.785 --> 15:13.353
Well, then feel free
to express that out loud

15:13.388 --> 15:15.989
as you pace the floors of
your dingy, lonely apartment,

15:16.024 --> 15:17.691
because you,
Will Schuester, are fired.

15:19.527 --> 15:20.494
I am not leaving.

15:20.528 --> 15:21.928
And I will

15:21.963 --> 15:23.697
be appealing this
to the school board.

15:29.537 --> 15:30.504
Oh, my God.

15:30.538 --> 15:31.738
Are we actually gonna do this?

15:31.773 --> 15:33.140
I've always wanted one.

15:33.174 --> 15:34.374
You think Blaine's
gonna be mad?

15:34.409 --> 15:36.176
Well, isn't he, like,
obsessed with Adam Levine?

15:36.210 --> 15:37.210
You're...
you're right.

15:37.245 --> 15:38.645
You're right about everything.

15:38.680 --> 15:40.414
- I just need to wake up and
come out of myself. - Yes!

15:40.448 --> 15:41.581
You know? I mean,
I'm an artist!

15:41.616 --> 15:42.883
I should start acting like one!

15:42.917 --> 15:44.584
Would Andy Warhol be
standing here worrying?

15:44.619 --> 15:45.686
No, he wouldn't!

15:45.720 --> 15:46.687
To rebellion.

15:46.721 --> 15:48.055
In all of its forms.

15:48.089 --> 15:49.056
Okay.

15:49.090 --> 15:50.190
Oh, chug, chug, chug. Ooh!

15:55.997 --> 15:57.931
Oh, my God,
there is a little...

15:57.965 --> 16:00.067
Oh, God, tastes like
lemons and gasoline.

16:00.101 --> 16:01.735
- The worst.
- It's the worst.

16:01.769 --> 16:03.330
- So, what are we gonna get?
- I don't know.

16:03.338 --> 16:04.338
Let's surprise each other.

16:04.339 --> 16:05.939
Okay. Look at the kitty cat.

16:07.008 --> 16:09.176
So who's first?

16:17.856 --> 16:19.156
Good morning, sunshine.

16:19.191 --> 16:20.491
Two shots of limoncello,

16:20.525 --> 16:22.827
- and I feel like I got hit by a bus.
- Ugh.

16:22.861 --> 16:24.896
I'm the worst rebel
in the world.

16:24.930 --> 16:26.330
Well, I made pancakes.

16:26.365 --> 16:27.131
Ooh!

16:27.165 --> 16:28.666
Ooh, oh, I forgot

16:28.700 --> 16:29.967
that was there for a moment.

16:30.002 --> 16:31.002
I didn't want a tramp stamp,

16:31.036 --> 16:32.970
and I thought if
I got it on my arm,

16:33.005 --> 16:34.672
then I wouldn't be able to go sleeveless again.
Well, let me see!

16:34.706 --> 16:37.875
Okay. So when we decided
that we were doing it,

16:37.910 --> 16:39.076
I knew exactly what I wanted.

16:39.111 --> 16:41.212
I even printed it out
in the font that I like,

16:41.246 --> 16:42.780
so the tattoo guy
knew exactly what to do.

16:42.814 --> 16:43.881
Okay.

16:43.916 --> 16:44.882
It's both personal

16:44.917 --> 16:46.884
and political, just like me.

16:48.153 --> 16:48.986
Ta-da!

16:49.021 --> 16:50.855
Oh, Kurt!

16:50.889 --> 16:51.889
"It Gets Better"!

16:51.924 --> 16:53.724
- That's so sw...
- What?

16:53.759 --> 16:54.825
Is it infected?

16:54.860 --> 16:57.361
No, it's just, it says
"It's Get Better,"

16:57.396 --> 16:58.796
not "It Gets Better."

16:58.830 --> 17:00.464
They misspelled it.

17:03.035 --> 17:05.002
Oh, my God.

17:05.037 --> 17:07.104
I have absolute nonsense
written on me permanently.

17:07.138 --> 17:09.106
Okay, y-y-y-you have
to get it removed.

17:09.141 --> 17:11.208
Of course I do.
What if I run into Dan Savage

17:11.242 --> 17:13.511
in the steam room at the gym?
I mean, I'll be humiliated.

17:13.545 --> 17:14.779
Don't worry, they do
a really good job

17:14.813 --> 17:16.180
at removing tattoos these days.

17:16.214 --> 17:18.249
Yeah, for tens of thousands of
dollars, which I don't have.

17:18.282 --> 17:19.750
Okay, then, we're going to
go back to the tattoo parlor

17:19.785 --> 17:21.252
and we're gonna have them fix it.
Just show me yours,

17:21.286 --> 17:22.553
'cause maybe he spelled
Streisand wrong,

17:22.587 --> 17:24.422
and, a-and we can be
maimed together.

17:24.455 --> 17:27.425
You know what? I, I, I
didn't go through with it.

17:27.459 --> 17:29.060
Are you kidding me?

17:29.094 --> 17:30.828
I was thinking about all
of my favorite idols...

17:30.862 --> 17:32.163
Barbra, Patti,
and Carole King...

17:32.197 --> 17:33.297
and none of them have tattoos.

17:33.332 --> 17:34.765
I cannot believe you backed out
without telling me.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.267
I went. I was going to go
through with it,

17:36.301 --> 17:37.601
but you were halfway
through yours, and I just...

17:37.636 --> 17:40.304
Look, I-I'm really
sorry, okay?

17:40.339 --> 17:42.540
I-I-I'll go back with you,
we can get your money back.

17:42.574 --> 17:45.109
No, what I want back I can't
get... my innocence, my pride,

17:45.143 --> 17:47.278
and my unblemished
alabaster skin.

17:47.312 --> 17:50.047
Kurt.

17:56.655 --> 17:58.622
Well, well, if it isn't

17:58.657 --> 18:02.460
the "Q" in the LGBTQ-
XYZ-who-gives-a-crap.

18:02.494 --> 18:04.695
You want me to warm that
seat up for you, sweetheart?

18:04.730 --> 18:05.963
Listen, we get it.

18:05.998 --> 18:07.598
It must just be hell
hiking up that lovely dress

18:07.632 --> 18:09.600
at a urinal. Just let me do my
business, and I'll go, please.

18:09.634 --> 18:12.403
Oh, sorry, we're just curious
how exactly you do that.

18:12.437 --> 18:14.005
Don't be scared.

18:14.039 --> 18:15.940
We're all guys here.

18:17.542 --> 18:20.277
Let's get

21:49.688 --> 21:51.522
Yeah, you know, some
people at this school need

21:51.556 --> 21:52.590
to get their ass kicked
to learn

21:52.624 --> 21:53.824
not to mess with you anymore.

21:53.858 --> 21:55.326
Come on, guys,
you know that's not a solution.

21:55.360 --> 21:56.393
No, enough is enough.

21:56.428 --> 21:57.661
Mr. Shue's right.

21:57.696 --> 21:59.430
I love you guys.

21:59.464 --> 22:01.765
And your support
means everything.

22:01.800 --> 22:04.535
But it won't fix anything.

22:04.569 --> 22:07.238
In fact, it'll probably
make everything worse.

22:10.742 --> 22:12.509
Motion approved to dig up
the school parking lot

22:12.544 --> 22:14.411
and move the Indian bones.

22:14.446 --> 22:17.514
Now, the McKinley School
Board calls to the podium.

22:17.549 --> 22:19.016
"Teacher of the Year..."

22:19.050 --> 22:21.652
What is this, a typo?

22:21.686 --> 22:22.886
William Schuester?

22:22.921 --> 22:24.555
Thank you, Superintendant.

22:24.589 --> 22:25.889
And a very good evening
to everyone.

22:25.924 --> 22:28.292
We really appreciate
you moving this meeting

22:28.326 --> 22:29.560
of the school board
to the auditorium

22:29.594 --> 22:32.796
where you could hear
and see our case.

22:32.831 --> 22:36.166
Now, as you all know, Sue
Sylvester has recently banned

22:36.201 --> 22:37.635
a dance known as twerking
from McKinley.

22:37.669 --> 22:39.169
You call it twerking?

22:39.204 --> 22:41.505
I call it dance porn.
Well,

22:41.539 --> 22:43.340
that is exactly
what people once said

22:43.375 --> 22:45.242
about an outrageous
new dance called...

22:45.277 --> 22:47.244
the waltz.

22:47.279 --> 22:48.612
It was considered indecent

22:48.647 --> 22:50.848
because a man
and woman were actually

22:50.882 --> 22:54.685
clutching each other as they
whirled around the ballroom.

22:54.719 --> 22:57.221
In the 1920s,
rebellious jazz babies

22:57.255 --> 23:00.524
shocked society by
kicking up their heels

23:00.558 --> 23:02.459
to Charleston.

23:04.629 --> 23:05.562
In the '50s,

23:05.597 --> 23:06.897
everyone was scandalized

23:06.931 --> 23:08.932
by Elvis' pelvis.

23:12.937 --> 23:14.405
And then came a flood

23:14.439 --> 23:15.706
of dirty dancing.

23:15.740 --> 23:17.141
The twist.

23:17.175 --> 23:18.942
The pony.

23:18.977 --> 23:20.644
And heaven forbid,

23:20.679 --> 23:22.012
the mashed potato.

23:22.047 --> 23:23.547
All considered scandalous

23:23.581 --> 23:25.082
and sinful then.

23:25.116 --> 23:26.617
Now, with time and distance,

23:26.651 --> 23:27.718
thought of as quaint

23:27.752 --> 23:30.020
and innocent even.

23:30.055 --> 23:32.556
In the '80s came
the most forbidden

23:32.590 --> 23:35.359
dance of them all...
the Lambada.

23:35.393 --> 23:37.461
Spawning national outrage

23:37.495 --> 23:40.064
and two not-so-great movies.

23:40.098 --> 23:41.598
And now...

23:41.633 --> 23:43.367
it's twerking.

23:48.540 --> 23:50.040
I guarantee you
that in 20 years,

23:50.075 --> 23:52.810
twerking will be considered
a silly nostalgic dance.

23:52.844 --> 23:54.478
So I ask you.

23:54.512 --> 23:56.673
Do you want to be on the right
side of musical history?

24:01.588 --> 24:04.613
Oh, hey, Sue.
You wanted to see me?

24:04.647 --> 24:06.381
William, you can wipe
that smug look off your face.

24:06.415 --> 24:07.849
And while you're at it,
wipe your chin

24:07.884 --> 24:09.885
- because there's a butt on it.
- Oh.

24:09.919 --> 24:11.953
Well, I asked you in here
as an act of contrition.

24:11.988 --> 24:14.389
Wade "Unique" Adams made
an impassioned plea

24:14.423 --> 24:16.458
for a unisex bathroom
at this school.

24:16.492 --> 24:18.460
The arc of the moral universe
is long,

24:18.494 --> 24:20.128
but it bends towards justice.

24:20.162 --> 24:21.496
Do you know who said that?

24:21.531 --> 24:22.631
Captain America.

24:22.665 --> 24:23.899
Dr. Martin Luther King.

24:23.933 --> 24:24.833
Hmm.

24:24.867 --> 24:25.934
And I was so moved

24:25.968 --> 24:27.369
I decided to
provide him with it.

24:27.403 --> 24:30.805
So, from this day forward,
let it be known

24:30.840 --> 24:32.240
that Unique will be able
to dump dirt

24:32.275 --> 24:34.175
in the privacy
of his very own crapper.

24:34.210 --> 24:36.278
Wow, that's...

24:36.312 --> 24:37.746
great.

24:37.780 --> 24:38.914
Where is it?

24:40.082 --> 24:42.317
We have to move it.

24:42.351 --> 24:45.086
We tried.
It's bolted to the floor.

24:45.121 --> 24:46.988
I am so sorry, guys.

24:47.023 --> 24:48.263
This is like
living a nightmare.

24:49.225 --> 24:51.593
Tina?
How could you?

24:51.627 --> 24:52.994
What? It's convenient.

24:53.029 --> 24:56.131
Jesus, get your priorities
straight.

24:56.165 --> 24:57.966
Uh, o-okay, guys.

24:59.035 --> 25:00.569
L-let's practice
our-our twerking.

25:05.775 --> 25:06.975
Are you dyslexic?

25:07.009 --> 25:09.477
Or illiterate?
Or a charlatan?

25:09.512 --> 25:11.046
You completely
messed up my tattoo.

25:11.080 --> 25:12.280
I am scarred!

25:12.315 --> 25:14.416
Let me see.

25:17.787 --> 25:20.455
That is exactly
what you told me to write.

25:20.489 --> 25:22.490
No, I wanted a message of hope.

25:22.525 --> 25:23.805
Something to represent
my strides

25:23.826 --> 25:25.026
I've made as an individual

25:25.061 --> 25:26.728
and the political sea change.

25:26.762 --> 25:28.496
You should've put
"It gets better" on there.

25:28.531 --> 25:29.764
I did!

25:29.799 --> 25:31.600
No, you didn't.

25:34.136 --> 25:36.071
This is what
you gave me to write.

25:36.105 --> 25:38.373
I ask questions
because I don't want to hear

25:38.407 --> 25:39.874
everybody's bullcrap story

25:39.909 --> 25:42.978
about what their tattoo means.

25:43.012 --> 25:45.313
I must've screwed it up
when I was typing it.

25:45.348 --> 25:47.949
Yeah.

25:47.984 --> 25:49.384
Let me ask you something.

25:49.418 --> 25:50.819
What are you even doing here?

25:50.853 --> 25:52.587
You don't seem
like the tattoo type.

25:52.622 --> 25:56.324
I wanted to rebel.
And shake off my doldrums.

25:56.359 --> 25:58.093
My path has been different

25:58.127 --> 26:00.061
and exciting considering
my background

26:00.096 --> 26:01.129
but considering
who I think I am,

26:01.163 --> 26:02.631
and how I see myself,

26:02.665 --> 26:05.266
It's like I've taken the
street car named predictability.

26:06.302 --> 26:07.335
I guess this is the price I pay

26:07.370 --> 26:08.637
when I try to surprise myself.

26:08.671 --> 26:10.105
Nah.

26:10.139 --> 26:12.040
I think your motives were true.

26:12.074 --> 26:13.975
It's just that, you know,

26:14.010 --> 26:15.343
when you go off road, man...

26:15.378 --> 26:17.278
weird stuff is gonna happen.

26:18.047 --> 26:20.281
Check this out.

26:25.154 --> 26:26.287
That demon looks
like John Davidson.

26:26.322 --> 26:28.556
I got that in Hong Kong.

26:28.591 --> 26:30.225
I was trashed, right?

26:30.259 --> 26:33.228
And I asked this guy
for a Harley Davidson tattoo.

26:33.262 --> 26:35.563
And I guess something
got lost in translation

26:35.598 --> 26:37.065
'cause when I woke up

26:37.099 --> 26:38.499
I had the host
of <i>That's Incredible!</i>

26:38.501 --> 26:39.467
On my freakin' chest.

26:39.502 --> 26:42.070
Eh. Turned him
into a demon.

26:42.104 --> 26:45.173
Lame ass goes to badass,
two hours tops.

26:45.207 --> 26:47.108
My body's covered
with mistake ink.

26:47.143 --> 26:48.810
You can fix damn near anything.

26:48.844 --> 26:49.978
How can you fix this?

26:50.012 --> 26:52.814
Why don't you give me
another shot at it?

26:52.848 --> 26:54.149
I'm, uh...

26:54.183 --> 26:55.884
starting to get a sense
of who you are.

26:55.918 --> 26:57.686
Why don't you hop
back up on the table

26:57.720 --> 26:59.154
and I'll see what I can do.

26:59.188 --> 27:01.489
No charge. I'll even throw
in a tongue piercing.

27:01.524 --> 27:02.924
No cost to you.

27:02.958 --> 27:05.026
Why would I want to do that?

27:05.061 --> 27:06.895
Look,

27:06.929 --> 27:08.897
you step back now,

27:08.931 --> 27:10.999
you will never take
another risk again.

27:11.033 --> 27:14.703
You will have given up on
the whole concept of going nuts.

27:14.737 --> 27:17.038
What you got to do is
you got to go more nuts,

27:17.073 --> 27:18.907
have a positive experience.

27:18.941 --> 27:20.909
And then you'll realize

27:20.943 --> 27:24.212
that that is where you find
the juice of life.

27:25.581 --> 27:27.315
Come on.
Oh...

27:27.349 --> 27:28.583
Okay.

27:28.617 --> 27:31.086
Juice of life.

27:35.224 --> 27:38.727
Oh, Marley, have
you seen this Vine?

27:38.761 --> 27:40.929
I call it "Squeezin' Out
a Twerkle Head."

27:40.963 --> 27:42.731
It looks

27:42.765 --> 27:45.066
like you've got a bad case
of the spastic butt coughs.

27:45.101 --> 27:46.735
Good one!

27:46.769 --> 27:49.804
You're hilarious. Like,
Comedy Central-funny. Hey!

27:49.839 --> 27:51.539
I was just trying to be helpful.

27:51.574 --> 27:53.742
I'd be happy to give
you twerk lessons.

27:53.776 --> 27:55.143
Twerking's really
not that hard,

27:55.177 --> 27:56.644
not if you have
the right partner.

27:56.679 --> 27:58.780
How do you think your
boyfriend got so good at it?

27:58.814 --> 28:01.449
Oh. Yeah, Jake didn't tell you?

28:01.484 --> 28:03.284
After your pathetic night of.

28:03.319 --> 28:05.286
"Don't touch me there,
I mean it, Jake,"

28:05.321 --> 28:06.721
he came running to me.

28:06.756 --> 28:08.590
And we twerked

28:08.624 --> 28:10.492
all night long.

28:10.526 --> 28:12.093
Mm, Jake's not like that.

28:12.128 --> 28:15.497
And if he was, he would aim a
lot higher than trash like you.

28:16.499 --> 28:18.333
That is slut-shaming.

28:18.367 --> 28:20.835
You are using
the derogatory label "trash"

28:20.870 --> 28:22.370
for a female's
natural sensuality.

28:22.404 --> 28:24.072
It's femiphobic,

28:24.106 --> 28:25.740
neoretrogenderist

28:25.775 --> 28:27.609
and a clear form
of sexual bullying.

28:27.643 --> 28:30.111
And as this beautiful
poster clearly states,

28:30.146 --> 28:31.780
this is a Bully-Free Zone.

28:31.814 --> 28:33.214
But I will be the better person

28:33.249 --> 28:34.749
and not report you
to Principal Sylvester

28:34.784 --> 28:36.117
for immediate expulsion.

28:36.152 --> 28:38.286
By the way, you know
that cute little mole

28:38.320 --> 28:39.888
on Jake's right hip
and how, when you kiss it,

28:39.922 --> 28:42.390
it drives him absolutely crazy?

28:42.424 --> 28:44.125
Oh, right.

28:44.160 --> 28:46.227
You wouldn't know
about that, would you?

28:46.262 --> 28:47.829
Well, trust me.

28:47.863 --> 28:49.864
He loves it.

28:59.253 --> 29:01.987
Hey, I was just ab...
about to come find you.

29:02.021 --> 29:03.855
Pull down your pants.
I want to see your right hip.

29:03.890 --> 29:06.458
I want to see if there's a mole. I want
to see if she's telling the truth.

29:06.492 --> 29:08.961
- Who? - Please tell me
there's no mole.

29:08.995 --> 29:11.129
Please tell me she's just lying
to screw with my head.

29:11.164 --> 29:13.398
Please tell me
you didn't really cheat on me,

29:13.433 --> 29:15.601
especially with h-her.

29:19.239 --> 29:21.273
- Marley...
- Oh, my God.

29:21.307 --> 29:23.468
- I'm so sorry. Look at me. Look...
- Just stop. Just stop.

Mr. Shue?

32:06.406 --> 32:09.374
I need to use the, uh...

32:09.409 --> 32:11.209
the magic bathroom.

32:11.244 --> 32:12.944
Okay, if Oprah's gonna

32:12.979 --> 32:14.413
drop the Cosby kids off
at the pool,

32:14.447 --> 32:16.248
I am not going
to be here for it.

32:16.282 --> 32:17.416
Wait.

32:17.450 --> 32:19.418
Unique doesn't need to use
the Porta Potti.

32:20.453 --> 32:21.186
Come with me.

32:23.022 --> 32:26.391
There's nothing wrong
with the Porta Potti.

32:26.426 --> 32:27.526
Again?

32:27.560 --> 32:30.028
She just used it, like,
five minutes ago.

32:31.063 --> 32:32.497
Thanks for doing this,
Mr. Shue,

32:32.532 --> 32:33.999
but I don't need a bodyguard.

32:34.033 --> 32:36.201
It's not about feeling safe
in the boys' bathroom;

32:36.235 --> 32:38.003
it's about feeling
like I don't belong.

32:38.037 --> 32:40.272
Look, I-I hate to say it,
but I-I think as long

32:40.306 --> 32:43.275
as you keep being yourself,
your life is probably gonna be

32:43.309 --> 32:45.076
a constant string
of "don't belongs."

32:45.111 --> 32:47.913
I know. I should probably
just start getting used to it.

32:47.947 --> 32:49.581
No, no, no.

32:49.615 --> 32:51.583
You should never
get used to it.

32:51.617 --> 32:53.919
All great change has come
from people who refused

32:53.953 --> 32:56.755
to get used to what was
accepted but wasn't right.

32:56.789 --> 32:58.790
Slavery, gay rights,

32:58.825 --> 33:00.859
New Coke.

33:00.893 --> 33:02.260
So, what you're saying is,
I should pull a Rosa Parks

33:02.295 --> 33:04.830
and refuse to give up my seat
in the girls' bathroom.

33:04.864 --> 33:07.499
Unfortunately, you're not going
to change the world overnight

33:07.533 --> 33:10.469
with some radical act
of rebellion.

33:10.503 --> 33:12.704
You just need to keep finding
the places you belong

33:12.738 --> 33:14.473
and the people you belong with,

33:14.507 --> 33:17.442
and then you'll have an army
to fight alongside of you

33:17.477 --> 33:20.045
until the world
is finally brave enough

33:20.079 --> 33:22.280
to accept you for who you are.

33:22.315 --> 33:23.849
It's hard, you know?

33:23.883 --> 33:25.717
Having to dress like this
every morning,

33:25.751 --> 33:28.487
knowing that almost
nobody will understand.

33:28.521 --> 33:32.057
But I don't have a choice...
this is who I am.

33:32.091 --> 33:34.192
Thank you for seeing
how hard it is.

33:34.227 --> 33:37.629
No one should have to work
so hard and risk so much.

33:41.367 --> 33:43.468
From now on, whenever
nature calls,

33:43.503 --> 33:45.270
I want you to find me.

33:45.304 --> 33:47.138
And I'm going to open
this up for you.

33:47.173 --> 33:50.709
It's a single stall,
so it's coed.

33:53.579 --> 33:57.015
No one needs to know
how you identify yourself.

33:57.049 --> 33:59.351
They just need to know that
you washed your hands after.

34:00.386 --> 34:02.354
Thank you.

34:04.223 --> 34:06.791
All right.

34:14.800 --> 34:16.434
Hey, Becky,
I'm here to see Sue.

34:16.469 --> 34:18.436
Do you have an appointment?

34:18.471 --> 34:20.237
No.

34:20.273 --> 34:22.040
Then get out, bitch!

34:22.074 --> 34:23.208
It's okay, Becky.

34:23.242 --> 34:24.442
Send him in.

34:26.946 --> 34:28.079
Have a seat.

34:28.114 --> 34:30.248
I saw you escort Unique

34:30.283 --> 34:32.516
to the teacher's restroom
and let him use it.

34:32.552 --> 34:35.554
And I think it's degrading
for him to have to do that,

34:35.588 --> 34:38.023
and it's given me
a change of heart.

34:38.056 --> 34:39.858
I would like to propose a deal.

34:39.891 --> 34:42.427
I'll give Unique a key
to that bathroom

34:42.460 --> 34:43.762
on one condition.

34:43.795 --> 34:44.963
What is it?

34:44.996 --> 34:47.666
You and the Glee Club
stop twerking. For good.

34:47.699 --> 34:49.935
Sorry, Sue, but there's no way in hell
that I'm going to make that deal.

34:49.969 --> 34:53.405
Oh, for God's sake, William,
that's your red line?

34:53.438 --> 34:56.274
Of all the things in the world
to be outraged about.

34:56.309 --> 34:57.642
This isn't about twerking.

34:57.677 --> 35:00.078
This is about standing up
to Sue Sylvester

35:00.112 --> 35:03.315
and her inane,
out-of-touch meddling.

35:03.349 --> 35:05.917
It's about rebelling against
your repeated attempts

35:05.952 --> 35:08.219
to suppress the Glee Club
and what we're trying to say.

35:08.254 --> 35:11.456
When a law is unjust,
it's your duty as an American

35:11.490 --> 35:13.024
to disobey.

35:13.059 --> 35:14.526
It's called
civil disobedience, Sue.

35:14.560 --> 35:15.860
Fine, have it your way.

35:15.895 --> 35:18.229
The chemical toilet stays bolted
to the choir room floor.

35:18.264 --> 35:21.032
Fine. And maybe I'll just throw
a Sue Sylvester-style

35:21.067 --> 35:23.301
rebellion tantrum
as I leave this office.

35:23.336 --> 35:25.470
I don't know
what you're talking about.

35:25.504 --> 35:26.738
Oh, no?

35:26.772 --> 35:30.508
It goes a little something
like this.

35:39.085 --> 35:40.485
William, stop that.

35:42.755 --> 35:44.189
William Michael Schuester!

35:44.223 --> 35:46.524
Becky, no, no, no.
Don't even think about it.

35:46.559 --> 35:47.726
Becky, no, no, no, don't...

36:02.292 --> 36:04.560
Hey, where have you been?

36:04.594 --> 36:06.074
Look, I know that
you're upset with me

36:06.096 --> 36:07.663
about the tattoo and everything,

36:07.697 --> 36:09.999
but this silent treatment,
it's a little immature.

36:10.033 --> 36:12.201
It's kind of hard to talk.

36:12.235 --> 36:13.536
Are you eating something?

36:13.570 --> 36:14.937
Did you get a pretzel from
the guy down the street?

36:14.971 --> 36:16.305
Because I thought
we were diet partners.

36:16.339 --> 36:18.407
I pierced my tongue.

36:18.441 --> 36:19.542
You pierced your tongue?!

36:19.576 --> 36:20.776
Oh, my God, that is so gross.

36:20.811 --> 36:21.911
Put that away.
I don't want to look at it.

36:21.945 --> 36:23.078
Doesn't it hurt?

36:23.113 --> 36:25.114
I-It's not that bad actually.

36:25.148 --> 36:27.483
Louis did it for free
when he fixed my tattoo.

36:27.517 --> 36:28.818
You fixed it? What did he do?

36:28.852 --> 36:31.420
No, he got a little creative
with the phrasing.

36:31.454 --> 36:32.788
One might say poetic.

36:32.823 --> 36:34.156
But, you know, I really
do think he captured my essence,

36:34.191 --> 36:35.391
given the circumstances.

36:35.425 --> 36:36.625
Let me see.

36:37.761 --> 36:39.962
"It's Got Bette Midler."

36:40.997 --> 36:42.531
"It's Got Bette Midler."

36:42.566 --> 36:44.333
Oh, my God, that is genius.

36:44.367 --> 36:46.268
And it makes absolutely
no sense.

36:46.303 --> 36:49.305
But it makes perfect sense, and
I honestly kind of love it.

36:49.339 --> 36:51.407
So, uh, what about
the tongue stud?

36:51.441 --> 36:53.209
Uh...

36:53.243 --> 36:56.979
I think... I was in
the same boat as you.

36:57.013 --> 36:59.682
Ever since Finn died, I've been
going about my business,

36:59.716 --> 37:02.117
but I've also kind of been
in a trance.

37:02.152 --> 37:07.056
And I guess I just needed
to be shocked back to life.

37:07.090 --> 37:10.259
And... there was something about
having a metal stud

37:10.293 --> 37:12.294
go through your tongue
that does the trick.

37:12.329 --> 37:13.929
Hmm.

37:13.964 --> 37:15.998
So, are you going to talk
like that forever?

37:16.032 --> 37:17.800
No, it should go down
after a couple days.

37:17.834 --> 37:19.001
You should totally
get one of these.

37:19.035 --> 37:21.537
Oh, yeah, totally.
Yeah, rethink that tattoo.

37:21.571 --> 37:23.906
I-I don't... I just...

37:23.940 --> 37:25.474
I don't think
that there's anything

37:25.508 --> 37:27.076
that I would, like, love enough
that I would want

37:27.110 --> 37:29.411
to get on my body
for the next 50 years, so...

37:29.446 --> 37:30.779
Well, suit yourself.

37:30.814 --> 37:33.015
Meanwhile, I'm going
to go Skype with Blaine

37:33.049 --> 37:34.683
and show him
my new tat and piercing.

37:34.718 --> 37:36.585
Maybe if I play
a little Maroon 5

37:36.620 --> 37:38.254
I'll get cyber lucky.

38:28.738 --> 38:30.706
Hey, guys. Guys.

38:30.740 --> 38:31.907
Mr. Shue, what's up?

38:31.942 --> 38:34.043
It's not the end
of the week yet.

38:34.077 --> 38:35.911
No. But it is
the end of twerking.

38:35.946 --> 38:38.013
Why? We were killing it.

38:38.048 --> 38:39.548
Well, some of us were.

38:39.582 --> 38:41.550
I know, and I'm sorry.

38:41.584 --> 38:44.420
After the school board meeting,
I thought it was smooth sailing,

38:44.454 --> 38:48.023
but twerking was... and
remains... a hot-button issue.

38:48.058 --> 38:49.325
I didn't think
this was one battle

38:49.359 --> 38:50.726
worth fighting to the death.

38:50.760 --> 38:52.895
Meaning... you caved.

38:52.929 --> 38:54.596
No.

38:55.565 --> 38:58.534
He did it for me,

38:58.568 --> 38:59.601
didn't you, Mr. Shue?

39:01.504 --> 39:03.305
That's why the Porta Potti
is gone.

39:03.340 --> 39:05.674
That's why Principal Sylvester's
out of my business.

39:05.709 --> 39:08.577
I-I'm not putting this
on you, Unique.

39:08.611 --> 39:11.413
I believe I did what anyone
in this room would've done

39:11.448 --> 39:13.749
for one of their friends.

39:13.783 --> 39:15.651
It was a judgment call,

39:15.685 --> 39:19.455
but some things are just more
important than others.

39:19.489 --> 39:22.558
I'm glad we're done twerking.

39:22.592 --> 39:24.433
I didn't like it,
and I never felt comfortable.

39:24.461 --> 39:26.762
Honestly, I just had
an awful week.

39:26.796 --> 39:28.197
I have to admit,

39:28.231 --> 39:30.099
twerking was really fun,
but it...

39:30.133 --> 39:33.335
just doesn't seem like
it was 100% our style.

39:33.370 --> 39:35.904
No big loss.

39:35.939 --> 39:37.272
Yeah, rebelling is one thing,

39:37.307 --> 39:38.947
but betraying who we are,
that's not cool.

39:38.975 --> 39:42.311
We are who we are,
no apologies necessary.

39:42.345 --> 39:44.246
All right, then,

39:44.280 --> 39:45.581
we're moving on,

39:45.615 --> 39:48.384
no regrets, no looking back.

39:48.418 --> 39:49.752
And I agree with you, Artie.

39:49.786 --> 39:52.154
So, I was thinking,

39:52.188 --> 39:53.822
instead of playing
against who we are,

39:53.857 --> 39:55.157
let's embrace it.

39:55.191 --> 39:56.959
Let's lean into our strengths

39:56.993 --> 39:59.428
by finding a song that's
old-school Glee:

39:59.462 --> 40:01.630
upbeat, optimistic,

40:01.664 --> 40:02.831
full of youth, and hope...

40:02.866 --> 40:04.500
