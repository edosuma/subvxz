00:28.208 --> 00:29.416
See you, Mom.

00:29.500 --> 00:30.708
See you, baby.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.666
MIDDELBO SHIPYARD

00:56.083 --> 00:57.291
Marie!

00:58.166 --> 00:59.166
-Hey.
-Hi!

00:59.791 --> 01:01.958
-Last night was fun.
-Yeah, it was.

01:02.625 --> 01:04.416
-I had a great time.
-Yes.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.166
My first class is with Hans.

01:09.500 --> 01:12.333
-That's a bit awkward.
-I get that.

01:12.416 --> 01:15.458
You could just think of Queen Margrethe.

01:16.916 --> 01:20.000
-Does it help?
-No, but you'll be thinking of the Queen.

01:20.916 --> 01:21.916
Okay.

01:25.666 --> 01:27.666
-Are we doing it again?
-What?

01:28.291 --> 01:30.250
Watching people, I mean.

01:30.333 --> 01:32.125
-It was fun.
-I know, right?

01:32.208 --> 01:33.625
It was so much fun.

01:34.166 --> 01:35.833
I'd really like to.

01:35.916 --> 01:38.875
-Cool. We just need to check with Mads.
-Okay.

01:39.833 --> 01:40.666
Cool.

01:41.875 --> 01:43.291
Maybe we'll see them have sex.

01:43.375 --> 01:45.708
-Do you want to see that?
-Totally!

01:48.166 --> 01:49.333
I actually can't wait.

01:52.458 --> 01:54.833
<i>Nature is so versatile.</i>

01:55.666 --> 01:59.166
Earthworms are hermaphrodites.
Most flowers are monoecious.

01:59.250 --> 02:01.500
-But we're humans.
-Exactly.

02:01.583 --> 02:03.583
For us, it is much more complex.

02:04.291 --> 02:09.041
With us, it might make more sense
to speak of three categories.

02:09.125 --> 02:13.916
Biological gender,
perceived gender, and gender expression.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.541
So, your biological gender may be female,

02:18.208 --> 02:22.875
but you perceive yourself as a male,
who feels like a female?

02:22.958 --> 02:25.583
In principle, yes. And what's correct?

02:26.166 --> 02:27.333
What's most important?

02:27.416 --> 02:28.875
What we are or what we…

02:31.166 --> 02:32.375
feel that we are?

02:33.625 --> 02:38.583
You might discuss three categories here…

02:38.666 --> 02:40.458
Please think about that
before our next lesson.

02:48.458 --> 02:52.708
Emma, have you got a second?
I'd like to talk to you after school.

02:55.500 --> 02:57.458
I'd like you to come to my house.

02:58.166 --> 02:59.583
To your house?

02:59.666 --> 03:01.041
Emma…

03:01.708 --> 03:03.833
I won't tell anyone what we saw.

03:03.916 --> 03:05.083
What do you mean?

03:05.791 --> 03:07.291
What do you mean?

03:08.666 --> 03:10.625
I have to do something else, sorry.

03:22.416 --> 03:23.416
Marie.

03:24.208 --> 03:25.458
-What's up?
-It's Hans.

03:25.541 --> 03:29.625
I think he saw us last night,
but he wants to talk to me.

03:30.208 --> 03:33.166
-About what?
-He's barely ever talked to me before.

03:34.166 --> 03:35.833
He wants me to come to his house.

03:37.750 --> 03:38.875
Don't do it.

03:38.958 --> 03:40.458
-No.
-There you are.

03:45.083 --> 03:46.708
-What are you doing?
-What?

03:47.375 --> 03:49.666
The town fair, remember?

03:50.583 --> 03:52.750
But we already talked about that.

03:53.458 --> 03:55.333
No, we didn't.

03:58.916 --> 03:59.791
Yes, we did.

03:59.875 --> 04:01.791
What's in your lunchbox? Blood?

04:01.875 --> 04:03.791
No, just pizza.

04:03.875 --> 04:06.791
-I'll see you later, right?
-No, you won't.

04:08.875 --> 04:09.958
Idiot.

04:50.125 --> 04:51.375
What's going on?

04:52.791 --> 04:54.833
The boys are just having fun.

04:55.500 --> 04:58.166
-Can you get it out?
-They've done it before. It's okay.

05:01.708 --> 05:03.666
Have you considered not being a vampire?

05:05.750 --> 05:07.625
It's not by choice.

05:07.708 --> 05:09.208
I just am.

05:09.291 --> 05:10.291
Sure.

05:10.875 --> 05:11.875
Of course.

05:13.958 --> 05:15.208
But why?

05:19.416 --> 05:21.166
You can't ask me that!

05:21.250 --> 05:23.416
It's just something you said yesterday.

05:23.916 --> 05:25.500
Everybody hides something.

05:26.000 --> 05:26.916
Beep-beep.

05:27.916 --> 05:28.916
Hello?

05:29.666 --> 05:30.666
Yes.

05:32.250 --> 05:33.250
Freud calling.

05:34.208 --> 05:35.625
He says to shut the fuck up.

05:36.875 --> 05:38.625
-Sorry.
-Don't apologize.

05:38.708 --> 05:40.291
Just do what Freud says.

05:59.291 --> 06:02.791
If you keep smashing that potato,
I may as well have mashed the whole thing.

06:05.500 --> 06:06.708
Do you want to talk?

06:08.083 --> 06:09.458
Could we move to Buenos Aires?

06:10.708 --> 06:11.666
Or Helsinki?

06:13.041 --> 06:17.458
Of all the places you could've lived,
you chose to live in Middelbo.

06:18.333 --> 06:19.250
Why?

06:19.750 --> 06:21.041
You know why.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.458
Why didn't you just stay in Copenhagen?

06:25.541 --> 06:28.333
-What would have been better there?
-Everything. Maybe.

06:29.541 --> 06:31.708
You can't run away from your problems.

06:37.291 --> 06:40.000
You know Hans, my biology teacher?

06:40.083 --> 06:41.083
Of course.

06:42.791 --> 06:45.166
He asked me to come to his house.

06:45.250 --> 06:46.958
Don't talk to him.

06:47.041 --> 06:50.083
-I'm not going to.
-Just keep away from him.

06:50.583 --> 06:51.416
Hi.

06:52.916 --> 06:53.916
Hi, Jonas.

06:54.625 --> 06:56.125
The door was open, so…

06:56.208 --> 06:57.208
Did you eat?

06:58.000 --> 07:00.125
-I did, but--
-Upstairs.

07:00.208 --> 07:01.208
Now!

07:01.708 --> 07:02.708
Nice.

07:06.208 --> 07:07.666
-Are you ready?
-What for?

07:08.291 --> 07:09.291
The ramp.

07:09.375 --> 07:10.416
Jonas.

07:10.916 --> 07:13.333
-Yes?
-You just made out with Noreen.

07:13.416 --> 07:16.375
We talked about it.
It didn't mean anything.

07:19.875 --> 07:20.916
Wanna go?

07:22.625 --> 07:24.500
Why did you guys do that thing to Marie?

07:26.208 --> 07:27.125
Who?

07:27.208 --> 07:28.291
The vampire.

07:28.791 --> 07:32.208
Oh, that. That was just a prank.

07:33.875 --> 07:37.875
We can do something else then.
We don't have to go to the ramp.

07:39.750 --> 07:40.791
We could just have sex.

07:40.875 --> 07:41.958
Seriously?

07:42.041 --> 07:44.500
-It's just a suggestion.
-I don't want to have sex right now!

07:45.000 --> 07:46.250
You're a pain in the ass.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.750
It might help.

07:49.166 --> 07:50.166
Get out.

07:51.291 --> 07:52.291
Okay.

07:55.708 --> 07:56.625
Leave.

07:57.291 --> 07:58.291
Emma…

07:59.041 --> 08:00.416
Can I take a piss first?

08:01.958 --> 08:03.000
-Quickly?
-Sure.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.041
Great. Thanks.

08:48.583 --> 08:50.000
I'll see you there then.

09:10.375 --> 09:11.875
-What are you doing?
-What?

09:11.958 --> 09:14.541
-Don't eat them all.
-Don't you get them for free?

09:14.625 --> 09:15.625
And so what?

09:16.166 --> 09:17.750
Haven't you had lunch?

09:17.833 --> 09:18.833
Marie?

09:21.458 --> 09:22.375
She's back.

09:22.958 --> 09:26.208
I may have found something
to make Jonas and the others stop.

09:26.291 --> 09:27.208
Look.

09:27.291 --> 09:31.958
We'll get them to leave you alone
by threatening to publish them.

09:32.041 --> 09:33.333
Did you take his phone?

09:34.083 --> 09:35.583
Well, it's funny.

09:36.583 --> 09:38.041
We'll post it all over school.

09:42.916 --> 09:43.750
Can't you see?

09:44.416 --> 09:47.125
I'll take the blame if they pin it on us.

09:48.250 --> 09:49.375
Was it this one?

09:51.500 --> 09:52.958
Or maybe this one?

10:05.375 --> 10:07.041
What the hell is wrong with you?

10:07.875 --> 10:09.250
Where did you get them?

10:10.083 --> 10:11.500
Isn't that what we do?

10:12.291 --> 10:13.833
We find out what people are hiding.

10:14.500 --> 10:16.208
But we don't expose them.

10:16.291 --> 10:19.791
No. We focus on uncovering
what happened 17 years ago,

10:19.875 --> 10:22.500
and what it has to do
with the signal from space.

10:23.166 --> 10:26.125
We don't expose people
for all kinds of ridiculous crap.

10:30.291 --> 10:31.500
I just wanted to help.

10:33.041 --> 10:35.041
Emma, wait.

10:37.541 --> 10:39.791
-Maybe you can go see Hans.
-What?

10:40.666 --> 10:42.750
-He asked her to go to his house.
-Why?

10:42.833 --> 10:46.791
We went to Susan's yesterday,
and Hans came, and maybe he saw her--

10:46.875 --> 10:48.375
Did Emma go to Susan's house?

10:48.958 --> 10:50.083
Yes, I thought--

10:50.166 --> 10:53.416
You brought Emma to Susan's,
and she was seen!

10:53.500 --> 10:57.125
-We don't know that.
-You just said she might have been.

10:58.791 --> 11:01.791
I can't handle it. It's just so annoying,

11:01.875 --> 11:03.833
when we agreed
that we do those things alone.

11:03.916 --> 11:06.166
-I just thought--
-Don't think!

11:06.250 --> 11:09.125
None of us should think.
We should just do what we agree.

11:09.208 --> 11:10.500
Is that so hard?

11:11.291 --> 11:13.916
-But isn't Hans super interesting?
-Yes, he is.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.583
And now, Emma can go
to his house and snoop around.

11:21.041 --> 11:22.250
What do you want with him?

11:25.250 --> 11:26.208
He's on the list.

11:27.541 --> 11:28.541
The list?

11:30.333 --> 11:32.375
He was also there 17 years ago.

11:33.375 --> 11:34.208
Okay.

11:35.500 --> 11:37.791
Emma, can you step outside
and let us talk about it?

11:55.916 --> 11:57.541
I want to show you something.

12:05.708 --> 12:06.791
What is it?

12:06.875 --> 12:08.916
I don't know. It doesn't exist.

12:09.708 --> 12:11.375
But I'm holding it right here.

12:11.875 --> 12:13.500
Hussein found it in the crater.

12:13.583 --> 12:15.583
He's kept it in his storeroom since then.

12:16.083 --> 12:19.208
I analyzed it, but I can't identify
the origin of the matter.

12:20.708 --> 12:22.041
But I know we're not alone.

12:23.250 --> 12:24.958
It's statistically impossible.

12:26.083 --> 12:27.291
Everything is connected.

12:29.125 --> 12:32.875
The meteor,
the signal last week, Astraeus.

12:34.375 --> 12:35.666
I just applied for a job there.

12:36.708 --> 12:37.708
Why?

12:38.375 --> 12:40.166
Didn't you want me to check them out?

12:41.291 --> 12:42.125
Right.

12:43.541 --> 12:44.416
But Hans first.

12:45.375 --> 12:46.375
Here.

12:47.208 --> 12:49.041
Plug that into Hans' computer.

12:50.708 --> 12:53.750
It has software
giving me access to all of his data.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.041
What's he hiding?

12:56.708 --> 12:59.041
I don't know. Everybody leaves a trace.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.750
Look around. Check out his house.

13:04.500 --> 13:05.958
Isn't that kind of illegal?

13:07.083 --> 13:09.125
Who cares? It's important.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.583
-Welcome.
-Thank you.

14:01.666 --> 14:04.500
-I'm Head of Staff and Recruiting.
-Okay.

14:06.458 --> 14:08.750
Elementary school, high school…

14:11.750 --> 14:12.583
But…

14:12.666 --> 14:14.250
So you have no formal qualifications?

14:14.958 --> 14:18.875
-Nothing that springs to mind, no.
-You certainly don't oversell yourself.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.125
Thomas said I could apply for a job.

14:22.625 --> 14:25.583
Sure, but you must have considered
the job you'd like.

14:26.333 --> 14:27.333
Not really.

14:27.916 --> 14:29.375
I just really need the money.

14:30.125 --> 14:31.125
Sure.

14:31.708 --> 14:33.083
At least you're honest.

14:33.166 --> 14:34.541
As it says on my CV.

14:34.625 --> 14:37.583
-That's not exactly work experience.
-No.

14:38.250 --> 14:40.166
I have plenty of that though.

14:40.833 --> 14:41.833
Yes.

14:43.375 --> 14:45.000
For three months at a time.

14:47.250 --> 14:49.666
But I'm willing to do anything.

14:52.458 --> 14:54.500
-Hi, Mom.
-What's up?

14:55.166 --> 14:58.166
-I got the job at Astraeus.
-Great.

14:59.500 --> 15:00.500
Yes.

15:01.166 --> 15:02.875
I'm cleaning toilets.

15:02.958 --> 15:04.500
Well, it's a start, I guess.

15:05.375 --> 15:06.916
Let's celebrate.

15:09.916 --> 15:11.333
How about tonight?

15:11.416 --> 15:13.958
-We could watch a film.
-I'm seeing someone from school.

15:14.625 --> 15:15.833
And I have homework.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.666
So, you're doing homework now?

15:18.166 --> 15:19.166
Yes.

15:20.041 --> 15:22.500
It might come as a surprise,
but I am trying.

15:22.583 --> 15:23.708
Great.

15:25.541 --> 15:27.041
And your biology teacher?

15:27.625 --> 15:28.750
Did he say anything else?

15:29.541 --> 15:30.375
No.

15:30.916 --> 15:32.291
Don't go to his house.

15:33.083 --> 15:33.916
I won't.

15:34.416 --> 15:36.041
I'm serious. I don't want you to.

15:40.875 --> 15:41.875
No problem.

16:35.750 --> 16:36.625
Emma.

16:37.833 --> 16:39.208
You wanted to see me?

16:39.708 --> 16:40.916
Yes, come on in.

16:41.916 --> 16:43.375
Cool. Thanks.

17:18.166 --> 17:19.375
Have a seat, please.

17:20.625 --> 17:21.458
No, thanks.

17:28.500 --> 17:29.916
How long have you been a teacher?

17:30.625 --> 17:31.625
For 15 years.

17:35.541 --> 17:36.375
Do you like it?

17:37.000 --> 17:38.083
It's okay.

17:39.291 --> 17:41.083
The students are the main problem.

17:47.458 --> 17:48.916
I have to take this.

17:51.083 --> 17:51.916
Hello.

17:55.333 --> 17:56.583
Now's not a good time.

18:00.333 --> 18:01.333
I see.

18:07.750 --> 18:08.875
No, I can't.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
No.

18:14.958 --> 18:16.708
We can't take too long to do it.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.250
But it…

18:22.000 --> 18:23.208
I can't promise that.

18:31.500 --> 18:32.666
I don't understand.

18:37.541 --> 18:38.833
It's all set up.

18:40.875 --> 18:42.541
I can let everyone know.

18:49.333 --> 18:50.791
We all need to meet.

19:00.625 --> 19:02.875
Well, I just don't understand.

19:04.791 --> 19:05.750
No.

19:08.208 --> 19:10.625
We've discussed this so many times.

19:17.791 --> 19:20.333
No. I completely disagree.

19:21.708 --> 19:22.958
No, I don't think so.

19:23.958 --> 19:25.166
Listen to me.

19:27.583 --> 19:28.500
Okay…

19:30.000 --> 19:31.375
That wasn't the deal!

19:32.208 --> 19:33.833
Did you talk to Adrian?

19:34.541 --> 19:35.666
I see!

19:35.750 --> 19:37.291
I'll have to do that then.

19:39.791 --> 19:41.625
What did you want to talk about?

19:47.208 --> 19:48.541
You have to go.

19:49.791 --> 19:51.250
There's nothing to talk about.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.333
I'd like a glass of water.

19:57.958 --> 19:59.666
Who sent you, Emma?

20:00.416 --> 20:02.041
I've known you for a long time.

20:08.166 --> 20:09.250
Just tell me.

20:10.500 --> 20:11.666
I won't be mad.

20:12.166 --> 20:13.375
I know how you feel.

20:15.125 --> 20:16.583
Like you don't belong, right?

20:17.541 --> 20:20.500
You feel a little left out.
As if you're not part of it all.

20:21.458 --> 20:23.500
-That's completely natural.
-Leave me alone.

20:38.333 --> 20:39.625
You think he had a secret room?

20:40.125 --> 20:42.500
It looked that way. There was music.

20:44.083 --> 20:45.916
There was a wall, but maybe--

20:46.000 --> 20:47.833
Maybe there was a door.
I know what you mean.

20:47.916 --> 20:50.041
There's something about him. He's odd.

20:51.125 --> 20:52.208
And he's lying.

20:52.875 --> 20:53.708
I can feel it.

20:56.041 --> 20:57.666
Could you get in there again?

20:58.250 --> 20:59.458
I'm not going alone.

21:00.458 --> 21:01.625
Someone will go with you.

21:07.375 --> 21:08.458
Okay.

21:09.041 --> 21:10.958
Frederik and Marie will go with you. Okay?

21:11.041 --> 21:12.000
Sure.

21:15.625 --> 21:16.833
Dad, I'm off.

21:30.791 --> 21:33.041
So, you're doing it today.

21:34.208 --> 21:35.125
Yes.

21:36.166 --> 21:37.041
Today's the day.

21:39.375 --> 21:41.083
Do you need a hand with Mom's stuff?

21:41.583 --> 21:43.166
No, I'm okay.

21:45.291 --> 21:46.541
Why today?

21:50.208 --> 21:51.958
I want it gone before Easter.

21:54.500 --> 21:55.583
This Easter?

21:56.833 --> 21:57.791
Yes.

21:58.375 --> 21:59.416
This Easter.

22:07.750 --> 22:08.750
Dad.

22:11.250 --> 22:12.250
Come here.

22:13.541 --> 22:14.750
Yes.

22:25.583 --> 22:26.583
Hi, Emma.

22:28.416 --> 22:30.916
-Hi.
-You know Find My iPhone, right?

22:31.916 --> 22:33.833
You can use it to find your phone.

22:35.875 --> 22:36.958
Why did you take it?

22:38.583 --> 22:41.000
Sorry. Isn't that all you have to say?

22:42.583 --> 22:43.916
This isn't working anymore.

22:45.416 --> 22:46.875
Emma, we can't be together.

22:47.958 --> 22:51.041
You're too weird.
I can't defend you with the others.

22:52.208 --> 22:53.583
So, I'm leaving you.

22:54.791 --> 22:55.833
You can't.

22:56.583 --> 23:00.125
I left you yesterday and the day before
and the day before that.

23:00.208 --> 23:02.708
-You can't break up with me.
-I'm leaving now.

23:03.875 --> 23:04.708
Here.

23:09.125 --> 23:10.250
Emma.

23:12.541 --> 23:13.583
Emma.

23:24.958 --> 23:25.958
Great.

23:26.458 --> 23:28.000
Let's go see Marie.

23:33.333 --> 23:34.500
Why did you kiss me?

23:37.458 --> 23:40.833
Everybody else does.
You've been with half of the school.

23:42.083 --> 23:43.666
You're scared of being alone.

23:45.541 --> 23:47.583
If you aren't Pussy Frederik,
then who are you?

23:48.375 --> 23:49.416
Pussy Frederik?

23:50.583 --> 23:51.791
What do you mean?

23:53.666 --> 23:54.666
Shit.

23:56.625 --> 23:57.833
Shall we go?

24:23.416 --> 24:24.583
There she is.

24:27.583 --> 24:28.583
He's home.

24:29.375 --> 24:30.458
Do we drop it, then?

24:30.541 --> 24:34.833
We could call him
and make him leave the house.

24:34.916 --> 24:36.125
What would we say?

24:36.208 --> 24:37.375
That…

24:38.916 --> 24:41.416
That there's a fire
in the biology lab at school.

24:42.125 --> 24:44.166
I don't think he'd care.

24:47.791 --> 24:49.208
I'll check it out.

24:49.291 --> 24:52.250
Let's make a plan first.

24:53.666 --> 24:56.291
-Be careful.
-I will, Mom.

25:00.541 --> 25:01.625
Idiot.

25:02.875 --> 25:05.416
-He's just very restless.
-I'll say.

25:10.666 --> 25:11.541
Thanks.

25:14.291 --> 25:15.291
What for?

25:16.375 --> 25:19.541
For thinking of me.

25:21.208 --> 25:22.791
For wanting revenge.

25:24.041 --> 25:26.000
Wasn't I supposed to listen to Freud?

25:27.875 --> 25:30.000
Yeah.

25:30.625 --> 25:34.916
He might have been an idiot
when he called like that.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.166
Maybe he was right.

25:36.875 --> 25:39.458
-It didn't really help.
-Nope.

25:40.625 --> 25:41.916
But it was nice of you to try.

25:49.500 --> 25:50.916
You're wrong, by the way.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.458
I know who you are.

25:56.291 --> 25:57.791
I want you to know it's okay.

26:01.500 --> 26:04.416
I don't have a problem with who I am.

26:05.708 --> 26:06.916
A vampire, you mean?

26:09.416 --> 26:10.416
Yes.

26:11.583 --> 26:12.583
Exactly.

26:18.166 --> 26:20.250
I just don't talk about it.

26:20.833 --> 26:22.166
So, nobody knows?

26:23.958 --> 26:25.416
Not even your family?

26:28.958 --> 26:33.208
My dad hasn't been great
since my mom died.

26:36.750 --> 26:38.958
We haven't really had the time…

26:41.083 --> 26:42.291
to talk about me.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.791
Shit. That's him.

27:05.458 --> 27:06.666
What did you say to him?

27:07.708 --> 27:09.625
-Didn't you call?
-No.

27:10.208 --> 27:11.291
Where's he going?

27:12.875 --> 27:15.250
I don't know. To Susan's? Let's go inside.

27:15.333 --> 27:18.541
We don't know
if he's just popping to the corner shop.

27:18.625 --> 27:20.750
Okay, you guys follow him.

27:22.125 --> 27:23.958
I'll go in alone.

27:24.875 --> 27:26.375
You can call me if he comes back.

27:26.458 --> 27:29.708
Weren't you super scared of him just now?

27:30.333 --> 27:32.208
Sure, but he left, you know.

27:33.750 --> 27:34.750
Okay.

27:59.291 --> 28:00.333
She's nuts.

28:04.333 --> 28:06.458
-Who?
-Well, Emma.

28:08.083 --> 28:09.833
She thinks she knows loads about you.

28:11.208 --> 28:13.833
Then she talks about the stuff
she thinks she knows.

28:14.541 --> 28:15.916
<i>But she doesn't know anything.</i>

28:20.375 --> 28:21.833
I think she knows a little bit.

28:23.416 --> 28:24.458
No, she doesn't.

28:25.541 --> 28:26.541
<i>Not at all.</i>

28:38.791 --> 28:39.791
He's going in.

28:42.583 --> 28:44.625
-What are you doing?
-Hang on.

28:50.666 --> 28:51.958
And he's gone again.

28:59.500 --> 29:01.125
What the fuck are you doing?

29:05.208 --> 29:07.625
You knew this day was coming.

29:10.375 --> 29:11.541
You have to stop.

29:11.625 --> 29:14.625
No, Hans.
I'm not ready to live without you.

29:14.708 --> 29:15.791
It's time.

29:16.333 --> 29:18.708
-Then take this.
-No, I don't want it.

29:18.791 --> 29:20.583
-Take it.
-I gave you that.

29:20.666 --> 29:21.750
I want to… Take it.

29:21.833 --> 29:23.208
-No.
-Take it!

29:24.791 --> 29:26.166
Then go!

29:27.208 --> 29:28.125
Leave.

29:43.125 --> 29:44.166
Come on, Emma.

29:51.250 --> 29:52.250
Shit!

30:13.041 --> 30:14.041
What are you doing?

30:14.708 --> 30:15.541
Nothing.

30:17.916 --> 30:21.250
-I was checking for cobwebs.
-Does your mom know you're here?

30:24.083 --> 30:25.041
No.

30:28.125 --> 30:29.166
Come on.

30:29.750 --> 30:31.791
-I don't think that's a good idea.
-Come on!

30:40.541 --> 30:41.541
Marie?

30:52.291 --> 30:53.666
<i>Are you on your own?</i>

30:54.416 --> 30:55.416
Yes.

30:56.541 --> 30:58.208
You can't run around out here.

30:58.291 --> 30:59.791
We can't trust anyone.

31:00.625 --> 31:02.708
I don't want them to know we're here.

31:02.791 --> 31:04.000
What do you mean?

31:11.875 --> 31:12.791
-Come here.
-No.

31:12.875 --> 31:14.208
Leave me alone!

31:18.916 --> 31:19.916
Hello?

31:24.125 --> 31:25.166
Emma?

31:43.750 --> 31:44.750
There you go.

31:49.958 --> 31:51.291
You said you were alone.

31:53.708 --> 31:55.375
Please let me go.

31:57.500 --> 31:59.166
Emma, you need to listen.

32:00.166 --> 32:01.208
Sit down.

32:01.708 --> 32:02.625
Come on.

32:03.208 --> 32:05.000
No!

32:06.291 --> 32:09.041
Emma, listen to what I'm saying to you.

33:31.333 --> 33:32.333
No, go away.

33:32.416 --> 33:34.041
Just take it easy.

33:34.125 --> 33:35.625
Stop! Let me go!

33:35.708 --> 33:37.250
-Emma, I just want to help.
-No!

33:37.333 --> 33:39.083
-I want to help you.
-Stop!

33:39.166 --> 33:42.000
Just relax! Please relax, okay?

33:42.083 --> 33:43.708
Relax. Okay.

33:45.333 --> 33:46.833
Easy. There you go.

34:13.916 --> 34:14.875
I don't want to.

35:35.166 --> 35:36.166
Emma?

35:38.375 --> 35:39.375
Hey.

35:47.041 --> 35:48.166
You're bleeding.

36:36.541 --> 36:37.541
Are you okay?

41:10.041 --> 41:13.708
