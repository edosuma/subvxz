WEBVTT

00:13.917 --> 00:16.146
Having been Henry's partner
and close friend,

00:16.257 --> 00:17.674
I hope you trust me

00:17.758 --> 00:19.425
to be open and honest
about this process.

00:19.787 --> 00:20.925
We trust you, Lonnie.

00:23.243 --> 00:25.648
On to the distributions.

00:25.733 --> 00:29.185
Larry and Sophie, you will
receive 12% of the trust.

00:29.270 --> 00:30.770
Eight percent will go
to Genevieve

00:30.855 --> 00:33.065
for her many years
of loyal service.

00:33.290 --> 00:35.775
I really loved working
for your father.

00:35.860 --> 00:39.279
The trust will provide for your
mother's mental health expenses.

00:39.363 --> 00:41.831
The rest will be split evenly
between the two of you

00:41.916 --> 00:43.583
with the following parameters.

00:43.617 --> 00:46.153
Kristen's inheritance
will be unrestricted.

00:46.273 --> 00:46.953
Ryan's

00:47.004 --> 00:49.622
will be doled out
in annual installments.

00:49.707 --> 00:51.458
WILFRED:
<i>Wait. That's it?</i>

00:51.509 --> 00:53.877
<i>So-so, I'm not even</i>
<i>in the will? What?</i>

00:53.961 --> 00:55.441
Just 'cause he thought
I was the cause

00:55.463 --> 00:56.546
of his son's disturbing,
insane behavior?

00:56.630 --> 00:57.964
Let it go, dude!

00:58.015 --> 00:59.766
LONNIE:
<i>Six percent of the trust has,</i>

00:59.800 --> 01:01.968
of course, been set aside
for my executor's fee.

01:02.019 --> 01:03.470
Don't executors

01:03.554 --> 01:05.438
who are friends of the family
usually wave their fees?

01:05.473 --> 01:07.724
Managing your father's trust is
gonna take a lot of time,

01:07.808 --> 01:10.193
time I'm usually
much better compensated for.

01:10.277 --> 01:11.895
But six percent--

01:11.979 --> 01:12.979
that's not even standard.

01:13.030 --> 01:14.948
Right?

01:14.982 --> 01:17.450
Ryan, right?

01:17.485 --> 01:18.985
LONNIE:
If there are

01:19.036 --> 01:22.121
no further objections,
why don't I explain to you

01:22.156 --> 01:24.374
how the distributions will work?

01:24.458 --> 01:27.160
My life is pathetic!

01:27.244 --> 01:28.661
No inheritance.

01:28.746 --> 01:30.497
I failed to lead you
to happiness,

01:30.548 --> 01:32.048
so, clearly, I'm not a god.

01:32.132 --> 01:34.501
And worst of all, my owner
takes off to Wisconsin

01:34.552 --> 01:35.835
and ditches me with her little

01:35.920 --> 01:37.971
flat-assed neighbor
for who knows how long.

01:38.005 --> 01:40.890
I'm kind of busy right now.
Doing what?

01:40.975 --> 01:42.976
That guy on the phone
who said his price just doubled?

01:43.010 --> 01:44.844
He called my dad's partner
a "bitch."

01:44.895 --> 01:46.679
He had to be talking
about Lonnie.

01:46.764 --> 01:48.481
Well, he was right
about the bitch part.

01:48.516 --> 01:51.100
I found a list of her passwords
in her assistant's desk.

01:51.185 --> 01:53.520
And I've searched everything--
her e-mails, bank accounts.

01:53.604 --> 01:55.021
I can't find anything

01:55.105 --> 01:56.739
about a $10,000 payoff
in the last month.

01:56.824 --> 01:58.024
So, get up off your flat ass

01:58.108 --> 01:59.943
and ask her what she
knows about the cult.

02:00.027 --> 02:01.528
Okay, stop talking about my ass.

02:01.612 --> 02:03.530
I'll stop talking
about it when you start

02:03.614 --> 02:05.865
doing some reverse lunges
to build up that ass.

02:05.916 --> 02:07.534
I want to see a goddamn
shelf back there!

02:07.618 --> 02:09.869
Lonnie already lied to me once.

02:09.919 --> 02:12.922
I just got to lay low
until I have some actual proof.

02:13.007 --> 02:14.207
Is that why
you left Kristen hanging today

02:14.291 --> 02:16.092
when she needed your support?

02:16.176 --> 02:18.461
Yeah, exactly. I didn't want
to get into it with Lonnie.

02:18.546 --> 02:20.046
Or maybe it's because

02:20.097 --> 02:22.382
you're just not a
very loyal brother.

02:22.433 --> 02:24.384
You're gonna lecture me
about loyalty?

02:24.435 --> 02:26.686
What? I'm <i> very</i> loyal.

02:26.720 --> 02:28.555
Ask Jenna.
Two seconds ago,

02:28.639 --> 02:30.723
you were whining about how she ditched you.
Yeah.

02:30.808 --> 02:33.109
That doesn't mean I'm gonna
stop being faithful to her.

02:33.193 --> 02:35.478
It's been two years, seven
months and three days

02:35.563 --> 02:36.863
since my last slip-up.

02:38.232 --> 02:40.617
Ryan...

02:40.701 --> 02:42.735
I'm an addict.

02:43.954 --> 02:46.406
(sighs) Jesus.

02:51.412 --> 02:53.463
I'm addicted to cuddling.

02:53.547 --> 02:56.499
(laughs)

02:56.584 --> 02:58.668
It's a disease, Ryan.

02:58.752 --> 03:01.588
Years ago, when I was
deep in my addiction,

03:01.672 --> 03:03.590
I used to break into
old folks' homes.

03:03.674 --> 03:07.760
Uh, I'd start by just
cuddling with one geriatric.

03:07.811 --> 03:10.763
Then it was five
geriatrics, ten geriatrics.

03:10.814 --> 03:13.733
Afterwards, I'd feel so ashamed.

03:13.767 --> 03:16.102
But the only thing that
would make me feel better

03:16.153 --> 03:18.688
about myself was more cuddling.

03:18.772 --> 03:21.240
Before I knew it, I was trolling

03:21.275 --> 03:23.860
the parking lots outside
Special Olympics events

03:23.944 --> 03:26.913
looking for some of
that simpleton strange.

03:29.283 --> 03:32.785
One night, I ended up in a back
alley getting hug-and-rubs

03:32.836 --> 03:34.504
from two <i> athletes.</i>

03:34.588 --> 03:36.956
If you're such an addict,

03:37.007 --> 03:38.958
why don't you ever try
and cuddle with me?

03:39.009 --> 03:43.763
Do something about that flat
ass, and maybe we'll talk.

03:43.797 --> 03:45.715
But I'm a lot better now.

03:45.799 --> 03:49.302
I'm in a healthy, monogamous
relationship with Jenna.

03:49.353 --> 03:53.523
I mean, this long distance
thing is gonna be a test, but...

03:53.607 --> 03:56.109
I'll get through it.

03:56.143 --> 03:58.394
As long as I have...

03:58.479 --> 04:01.147
the house dog's little helper.

04:01.198 --> 04:03.616
(buzzing)

04:03.651 --> 04:05.118
Mmm.

04:07.287 --> 04:09.072
Ah.

04:09.156 --> 04:10.490
(laughs softly)

04:10.541 --> 04:12.909
(doorbell rings)

04:16.664 --> 04:18.498
You'll never believe it!

04:18.548 --> 04:20.800
Arturo wants full
custody of Joffrey!

04:20.834 --> 04:22.919
Oh, my God.
What?! Joffrey can't leave.

04:23.003 --> 04:24.637
Who's gonna let me
wake them up from naps

04:24.672 --> 04:26.923
with my unmotivated barking?

04:27.007 --> 04:28.391
He says
Joffrey needs to be raised

04:28.475 --> 04:30.760
in a more
"traditional family atmosphere."

04:30.844 --> 04:32.845
(scoffs)

04:34.815 --> 04:37.266
I can't even imagine
my life without him.

04:37.351 --> 04:40.019
(crying):
I'd miss him so much.

04:40.104 --> 04:42.522
Uh, what are you doing?

04:42.606 --> 04:45.024
I wouldn't worry, Kristen.

04:45.075 --> 04:47.026
Courts typically rule
in favor of the mother.

04:47.111 --> 04:48.528
Well...

04:48.612 --> 04:50.163
What?
Um...

04:50.197 --> 04:53.249
There was this incident
at the mall.

04:53.333 --> 04:54.951
WILFRED: I should
probably warn you.

04:55.035 --> 04:56.536
I'm in a relationship right now.
And?

04:56.620 --> 04:57.954
I grabbed the wrong stroller

04:58.038 --> 04:59.706
and walked away
with a different baby.

04:59.790 --> 05:01.624
It was an innocent mistake,

05:01.709 --> 05:03.793
but then, the cops
were called, and

05:03.877 --> 05:05.628
(moaning) I'm afraid Arturo's
gonna use it against me.

05:05.713 --> 05:07.380
I can't do this.
Will you help me?

05:07.464 --> 05:09.849
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

05:09.883 --> 05:12.969
Family law isn't really my expertise.
I know, but

05:13.053 --> 05:15.354
before I have to hire
some high-priced lawyer

05:15.389 --> 05:17.140
(crying): and get into
a big custody battle,

05:17.224 --> 05:19.726
will you just at least
lean on him a little?

05:19.777 --> 05:22.361
WILFRED: Is your finger
where I think it is?

05:22.396 --> 05:25.198
On your hand with your other
fingers petting my back?

05:25.232 --> 05:28.034
Oh, you are a freak.

05:28.068 --> 05:30.369
(Kristen cries)
Fine, I'll help you.

05:30.404 --> 05:31.738
Really?

05:31.789 --> 05:34.490
Oh, thank you so much.

05:36.076 --> 05:37.493
I must look like
a mess right now.

05:37.578 --> 05:38.828
I'm just... I'm gonna use
your bathroom, okay?

05:38.912 --> 05:40.379
(Wilfred sighs)

05:40.414 --> 05:43.082
Whoa. Man, that was
crazy back there.

05:43.133 --> 05:44.801
Did you see that?

05:44.885 --> 05:47.053
She was all over me,
and I was just, like,

05:47.087 --> 05:50.256
"Get up off my cute
bald belly, bitch."

05:50.307 --> 05:52.058
God, her timing is so annoying.

05:52.092 --> 05:54.060
I need to focus on figuring out
the connection

05:54.094 --> 05:55.678
between Lonnie and the cult.

05:55.763 --> 05:57.563
If I can remain
faithful to Jenna

05:57.598 --> 05:59.265
in these trying times, Ryan,

05:59.349 --> 06:01.567
then I think you can be
there for your sister.

06:01.602 --> 06:03.102
(footsteps approaching)

06:03.153 --> 06:05.438
Your water does not get
very hot, does it?

06:05.489 --> 06:08.491
Oops.

06:08.575 --> 06:10.243
Joffrey's shoe!

06:12.529 --> 06:15.281
What if I never get to kiss
his cute little toes again?

06:15.365 --> 06:17.500
(crying)

06:17.584 --> 06:19.452
Oh. Stop!

06:19.536 --> 06:22.705
Please! No!

06:27.227 --> 06:28.811
You want us to split holidays?

06:28.895 --> 06:30.855
Well, it's just a place
to start negotiating from.

06:30.872 --> 06:32.255
I can't imagine

06:32.340 --> 06:33.457
not having Joffrey around
for all the holidays.

06:33.541 --> 06:34.958
Makes you just want

06:35.043 --> 06:36.676
to break down sobbing

06:36.711 --> 06:39.012
and fondle the softest,
velvetiest thing on earth.

06:39.047 --> 06:41.214
Like, a dog's ear perhaps?

06:41.299 --> 06:43.183
Ugh! What's up
with Wilfred today?

06:43.217 --> 06:45.719
He's being such a pest.
Wilfred, get down.

06:45.803 --> 06:48.753
You're giving him two weekends a
month? Right now, it's just one.

06:48.873 --> 06:50.290
Ryan, I thought
you were gonna fight for me.

06:50.341 --> 06:52.087
This is what a
settlement's all about.

06:52.207 --> 06:53.237
Unless you want to go to court,

06:53.357 --> 06:54.687
there are gonna have
to be compromises.

06:54.807 --> 06:56.087
Just don't let him railroad you.

06:56.195 --> 06:57.848
Arturo's a lying scumbag.

06:59.300 --> 07:00.717
God, I hate this so much.

07:00.802 --> 07:02.482
I hate... even entertaining
the possibility

07:02.514 --> 07:03.907
of losing him.

07:05.527 --> 07:07.445
Come here.

07:14.703 --> 07:18.122
Yeah, uh, I'm not here to haggle
over days and weekends, Ryan.

07:18.206 --> 07:20.074
I'm asking for full custody.

07:20.158 --> 07:22.126
I know. But I-I assume
that neither of you

07:22.210 --> 07:23.878
want to go to court over this.

07:23.912 --> 07:25.329
Did she tell you about the mall?

07:25.414 --> 07:28.299
Yes. But that
was an accident.

07:28.383 --> 07:30.134
She tell you I found
a Lego man's head

07:30.218 --> 07:31.502
in Joffrey's stool last month?

07:31.586 --> 07:33.554
It still had a cowboy hat on.

07:33.588 --> 07:34.889
Uh, well...
I assume that

07:34.923 --> 07:36.807
Kristen's been
going through a lot

07:36.892 --> 07:39.226
since your father died-- which I
was sorry to hear, by the way.

07:39.261 --> 07:42.480
I have no intention
of kicking her while she's down.

07:42.564 --> 07:44.398
I only want what's best
for Joffrey, Ryan.

07:44.433 --> 07:46.517
And I know she thinks
I'm a manipulative jerk,

07:46.601 --> 07:49.353
but let's be honest, she tends
to see the worst in people.

07:49.438 --> 07:50.771
I-I just

07:50.856 --> 07:53.157
want to see my son more.

07:57.279 --> 07:59.663
What if she gave you weekends?

07:59.748 --> 08:01.081
All of them?

08:02.951 --> 08:04.535
Well, that would make
a big difference.

08:04.619 --> 08:06.921
Although, we were planning
on taking the kids to Spain

08:06.955 --> 08:09.423
for the summer-- it'd be a shame
if Joffrey couldn't meet

08:09.458 --> 08:12.460
his grandparents and his
cousins,<i> la grande familia.</i>

08:12.511 --> 08:13.878
I guess I can urge Kristen

08:13.962 --> 08:15.629
to make an exception
for July and August.

08:15.680 --> 08:16.764
And September.

08:18.767 --> 08:21.385
Jesus! Is that
my son's pacifier?

08:21.470 --> 08:23.220
Wilfred!
What?

08:23.305 --> 08:25.139
Oh! How did <i> that</i>
get there?

08:25.223 --> 08:26.774
I am so sorry.

08:26.808 --> 08:28.309
This is what
I'm talking about, Ryan?

08:28.360 --> 08:29.727
She leaves all of Joffrey's
things lying around.

08:29.811 --> 08:31.479
You realize my son
sucks on that?

08:31.530 --> 08:33.447
Not when there's a pacifier in it.
(groans)

08:35.700 --> 08:38.235
He just left,
and you're lucky I...

08:38.320 --> 08:41.121
Okay, I know what
you're thinking,

08:41.155 --> 08:43.657
but those performers are
over two and half years old.

08:43.741 --> 08:45.960
They're all legal.
Barely.

08:45.994 --> 08:47.378
What is wrong with you!
I accidentally

08:47.462 --> 08:48.996
sat on Joffrey's binky.

08:49.080 --> 08:50.714
Big deal.
No, you were

08:50.799 --> 08:52.800
trying to make Kristen
look like a bad mother.

08:52.834 --> 08:54.718
Why would I do that?
Because if she

08:54.803 --> 08:56.587
loses custody of Joffrey,
then she'll get depressed

08:56.671 --> 08:58.422
and lonely and want
to cuddle with you.

08:58.507 --> 09:01.976
Okay. The truth is...

09:02.010 --> 09:04.678
when Jenna cuddles me,
she just lies there.

09:04.763 --> 09:06.480
Kristen gives that bomb cuddle.

09:06.515 --> 09:09.600
But don't act like I'm the only
one trying to dick her over.

09:09.602 --> 09:11.185
I'm trying to help her

09:11.236 --> 09:13.521
I just got Arturo
to agree to a compromise,

09:13.572 --> 09:16.273
in spite of the pacifier
up your ass.

09:16.358 --> 09:18.359
I overheard you both.
You were hardly putting up a fight there.

09:18.410 --> 09:19.777
If he says something
about Kristen

09:19.861 --> 09:21.745
that's true,
I'm not gonna deny it.

09:21.830 --> 09:23.030
She's family--
you're supposed

09:23.081 --> 09:25.165
to defend her, not resent her.

09:25.200 --> 09:27.201
I don't resent her!
Ah, so it doesn't bother you

09:27.252 --> 09:29.870
that she doesn't have any
restrictions on her inheritance?

09:29.921 --> 09:32.540
Or that your dad clearly
trusted her more than you?

09:32.591 --> 09:34.041
Don't turn this around on me.

09:34.092 --> 09:36.093
The truth is,
your little "addiction"

09:36.177 --> 09:37.845
is getting out of control.

09:37.879 --> 09:39.880
I'm not listening
to this bullshit.

09:39.965 --> 09:42.049
Wilfred... Wilfred,
this has to stop!

09:42.100 --> 09:44.018
I don't have a problem, okay?

09:44.052 --> 09:45.532
My addiction is
totally under control!

09:51.109 --> 09:53.143
What's this?

09:53.228 --> 09:54.695
Bear,

09:54.729 --> 09:59.233
I thought you were in
Iceland until the 15th.

09:59.284 --> 10:00.868
An intervention?

10:00.902 --> 10:03.320
Uh, and so...

10:03.405 --> 10:04.738
you're the interventionist?

10:04.823 --> 10:06.373
(chuckles):
What's that?

10:06.408 --> 10:08.075
All right, you haven't cuddled

10:08.126 --> 10:10.244
in 71 million years,
four months and two days?

10:10.295 --> 10:13.047
No offense, but you don't
strike me as the kind of guy

10:13.081 --> 10:14.632
who has to fight off
the cuddles.

10:14.716 --> 10:15.833
Oh-ho-ho!

10:15.917 --> 10:17.501
Oh, that's hilarious.

10:17.586 --> 10:19.336
You're calling <i> me</i> out
on self-restraint?

10:19.421 --> 10:21.305
Oh, really?

10:21.389 --> 10:22.890
This coming from a guy who's

10:22.924 --> 10:24.485
been up for days
smoking God knows what.

10:24.509 --> 10:26.060
Look at your eyes!

10:26.094 --> 10:28.345
They're practically
popping out of your head.

10:28.430 --> 10:30.064
Oh, oh, that's your defense?

10:30.098 --> 10:32.516
Yelling your name out
at the top of your lungs.

10:32.601 --> 10:34.101
I don't have to listen to this.

10:34.152 --> 10:36.904
Bear... let go of me.

10:36.938 --> 10:39.189
I said let go!

10:39.274 --> 10:40.274
(grunts)

10:40.358 --> 10:42.776
Aah! Aah!

10:42.827 --> 10:44.361
(grunts, yells)

10:44.446 --> 10:46.163
Aah...!

10:46.247 --> 10:49.583
(sobbing):
I don't have a problem!

10:49.618 --> 10:52.119
I don't have a problem!

10:52.203 --> 10:54.788
(sobbing)

10:58.843 --> 11:00.260
(whispers): Shh.
He's sleeping.

11:08.637 --> 11:11.972
- Hey, did I leave, um, Joffrey's 
Cookie Monster doll here? - Yeah,

11:12.057 --> 11:14.058
I think it's in the kitchen.
Oh.

11:17.028 --> 11:19.480
Are you okay?
Yeah.

11:19.531 --> 11:22.983
Just exploring new ways to spice
up my relationship with Jenna.

11:25.870 --> 11:27.988
You were right-- I was
going off the deep end.

11:28.039 --> 11:29.990
And all the people in
that room yesterday

11:30.041 --> 11:32.126
were just there because
they care about me.

11:32.160 --> 11:34.795
Except Animal. Turns out he wasn't
even there for the intervention.

11:34.829 --> 11:36.747
He was just <i> in</i> the house.

11:36.831 --> 11:40.050
He stole 50 yards of copper wiring
out of your wall, by the way.

11:40.135 --> 11:42.302
KRISTEN:
I'm not seeing it, Ryan.

11:46.057 --> 11:47.341
Okay.

11:47.392 --> 11:49.143
It's outside.

11:52.897 --> 11:55.182
Thank you.
I know you're nervous about today.

11:55.233 --> 11:56.183
Nervous?

11:56.267 --> 11:57.401
Every weekend?

11:57.485 --> 12:00.154
Most holidays?
The entire summer?

12:00.188 --> 12:03.023
Once Joffrey goes to school,
I'll barely see him.

12:03.108 --> 12:04.908
Maybe you were right--
maybe I should hire

12:04.993 --> 12:06.577
a real family lawyer,
because it doesn't feel

12:06.661 --> 12:08.028
like you're on my side.

12:08.079 --> 12:10.914
Of course I'm on your side.

12:10.999 --> 12:12.666
No offense, but it's not like

12:12.701 --> 12:14.251
you're making it
any easier for me.

12:14.335 --> 12:15.536
The mall incident?

12:15.620 --> 12:18.122
The Lego head?

12:18.206 --> 12:20.207
He told you about the Lego head?
Look,

12:20.291 --> 12:21.709
I know it's not ideal,

12:21.760 --> 12:24.011
but at least Arturo has
agreed to these terms.

12:24.045 --> 12:27.047
I think he honestly wants
to make this work.

12:27.132 --> 12:29.850
(sighs) Just... try to be nice.

12:30.935 --> 12:32.886
(softly): Okay.

12:37.225 --> 12:38.475
ARTURO:
Oh, hello, Ryan.

12:38.560 --> 12:40.394
Uh, Kristen.

12:40.478 --> 12:41.729
Uh, oh.

12:41.780 --> 12:43.480
New watch.
Cartier.

12:43.565 --> 12:45.315
Wow. Expensive.

12:45.400 --> 12:47.785
Not as expensive as your S-Series.
No, actually,

12:47.869 --> 12:50.237
I sold it. Yeah.
No, I bought a minivan.

12:50.288 --> 12:52.072
(laughing)

12:52.123 --> 12:53.707
Well, at some point,
any good parent realizes

12:53.742 --> 12:55.943
your child is just more
important than your image, so...

12:55.960 --> 12:57.461
(mumbles)
Mm-mm-mm.

13:00.498 --> 13:02.883
That's good advice.
Thank you.

13:02.917 --> 13:05.502
So, where's my little man?

13:05.587 --> 13:07.504
Is this a joke?

13:07.589 --> 13:10.474
No. No, I...

13:10.558 --> 13:11.642
Where the hell's our son?

13:11.726 --> 13:14.094
He was here before.

13:14.145 --> 13:15.813
WILFRED (over phone):
Relax, Ryan.

13:15.897 --> 13:18.148
Joffrey's fine.
ARTURO: I want full custody!

13:18.233 --> 13:19.933
Oh, my God,
Ryan! Let's go!

13:19.984 --> 13:22.936
Sounds like Kristen
could use a good <i> cuddle.</i>

13:27.082 --> 13:31.168
The sad thing is, I don't even remember
taking him out of the stroller.

13:31.253 --> 13:33.003
N-No, it's my fault-- I was
pushing the stroller;

13:33.088 --> 13:34.838
I should have noticed.

13:35.683 --> 13:37.350
I'm a horrible mother.

13:37.401 --> 13:40.020
I deserve to lose custody.

13:40.104 --> 13:42.572
I'm gonna fix this, I promise.

13:42.656 --> 13:44.574
WILFRED (in distance):
Ass-to-ass.

13:44.658 --> 13:47.327
Ass-to-ass.

13:47.361 --> 13:49.779
Ass-to-ass.

13:49.864 --> 13:52.499
Ass-to-ass. Come on,
Bear, I can't hear you.

13:52.533 --> 13:54.367
Ass-to-ass.

13:54.452 --> 13:56.453
Ass-to-ass.

13:56.537 --> 13:58.838
There we go! Hey, hey!
What the hell

13:58.873 --> 14:01.374
are you doing?! Oh!
Putting a stop to this shit.

14:01.425 --> 14:03.209
It's bad enough
you lock me down here

14:03.294 --> 14:05.334
while Kristen's up there aching
for a rough snuggle!

14:05.346 --> 14:07.297
Now I'm not even allowed
to stroke it?!

14:07.381 --> 14:08.598
You switched Joffrey out
for a doll.

14:08.682 --> 14:10.216
Do you realize how dangerous
that was?

14:10.267 --> 14:12.185
He was napping the whole time.

14:12.219 --> 14:14.220
Come on. We're going.
Where?

14:14.271 --> 14:16.056
To beg Arturo
to cut Kristen a break.

14:16.107 --> 14:17.640
And there's no way
I'm leaving you in the house

14:17.725 --> 14:19.109
alone with her.

14:19.193 --> 14:21.394
Hey. Any of you bitches
want to party?

14:21.445 --> 14:23.563
You look like you could
cuddle me long time.

14:23.647 --> 14:27.033
Oh, really?
At least crack it, dude.

14:27.068 --> 14:31.287
Thanks for agreeing
to meet me again.

14:31.372 --> 14:34.824
Do you want to...
get some lunch?

14:35.876 --> 14:38.411
I brought mine.

14:38.462 --> 14:41.164
The food here is processed
and unhealthy.

14:41.248 --> 14:44.134
Listen, I-I know how
this morning looked,

14:44.218 --> 14:47.053
but it-it wasn't Kristen's fault.
No, this wasn't

14:47.088 --> 14:49.089
about this morning, Ryan.
It's about all

14:49.140 --> 14:50.757
the terrible choices
and mistakes

14:50.808 --> 14:52.559
that Kristen's made as a mother.

14:52.593 --> 14:54.344
She loves Joffrey so much.

14:54.428 --> 14:57.263
There must be
something she can do.

14:58.599 --> 15:00.934
Your, uh...

15:01.018 --> 15:04.404
y-your father, he was
a very accomplished lawyer,

15:04.438 --> 15:07.407
Ryan, and I can
only imagine the extent

15:07.441 --> 15:10.944
of Kristen's inheritance.
I mean, I saw the Cartier watch.

15:10.995 --> 15:12.862
(scoffs)

15:12.947 --> 15:14.781
You want a payoff?

15:14.865 --> 15:16.366
You said it, not me.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.002
Look, I-I wasn't lying

15:19.086 --> 15:20.753
when I asked for custody.

15:20.788 --> 15:22.455
But then when Kristen
forgot Joffrey,

15:22.540 --> 15:24.757
what was I gonna do,
not ask for money?

15:24.792 --> 15:27.627
How much?

15:27.678 --> 15:30.680
I'd be willing to go back to the
original agreement for, say,

15:30.764 --> 15:33.716
a... quarter of a million.

15:33.801 --> 15:36.769
But you're a successful doctor.
With a shitload of debt.

15:36.804 --> 15:38.771
I mean, did you honestly think
I wanted to trade in my S-Series

15:38.806 --> 15:40.440
for a minivan?

15:40.474 --> 15:42.475
You think I choose to bring
my lunch in every day?

15:42.526 --> 15:44.527
I love the chicken tenders here.

15:44.612 --> 15:45.862
That's a Handi-Snack.

15:45.946 --> 15:48.314
Kristen was right about you.

15:48.365 --> 15:49.749
It's not like she's got it
all figured out.

15:49.817 --> 15:51.050
She can't keep a husband.

15:51.118 --> 15:52.652
She can't keep a job.

15:52.720 --> 15:54.420
And apparently is not enough
to screw up her own life,

15:54.455 --> 15:56.732
now she's got to screw up
her kid's, too?

15:57.895 --> 15:59.125
I'll pay you the money.

16:00.427 --> 16:02.061
But only if Kristen gets

16:02.096 --> 16:03.563
full custody of Joffrey.

16:03.597 --> 16:05.431
Joffrey's my son.

16:05.482 --> 16:07.483
Let's make it $500,000.

16:07.568 --> 16:11.020
I assume you know
how to make that legal.

16:11.105 --> 16:12.939
Sure.

16:13.023 --> 16:14.774
That's easy.

16:14.859 --> 16:17.443
I'm paying you to settle a
potential assault lawsuit.

16:17.494 --> 16:18.578
Assault?

16:19.613 --> 16:22.448
Are you kidding me?!

16:22.499 --> 16:24.417
(sighs) Full custody.

16:24.451 --> 16:26.786
I can't believe it.

16:26.871 --> 16:30.123
Yeah. Well, once I explained
how much he was hurting you,

16:30.207 --> 16:32.292
he totally caved.

16:32.343 --> 16:35.678
I am so sorry I accused you
of not fighting for me.

16:35.763 --> 16:38.882
I-I know I'm not always there
for you.

16:38.966 --> 16:46.339
At least, not as much
as I should be.

16:46.407 --> 16:49.909
Sometimes I resent you a little.

16:49.977 --> 16:52.478
What? Why?
Like with the inheritance,

16:52.529 --> 16:54.147
Dad didn't put any restrictions
on yours.

16:54.198 --> 16:56.149
He always held me
under a microscope

16:56.233 --> 16:57.700
while you got away scot-free.

16:57.785 --> 16:59.402
You think it was easy for me?

16:59.486 --> 17:01.204
No matter what I did,

17:01.288 --> 17:03.323
I could never get him
to pay any attention to me.

17:05.125 --> 17:07.660
I do miss him, Ryan.

17:07.744 --> 17:09.662
Me, too.

17:09.713 --> 17:11.714
Don't beat yourself up.

17:11.799 --> 17:15.801
For a horrible brother,
you're still pretty amazing.

17:15.836 --> 17:19.839
Yeah. You're a pretty amazing
horrible sister, too.

17:19.924 --> 17:21.473
(both chuckle)

17:24.531 --> 17:27.532
Hey, I want you to know
I'm in recovery now.

17:28.436 --> 17:30.638
I've been going to the meetings

17:30.706 --> 17:32.974
and, you know, doing
the whole 12-step thing.

17:33.042 --> 17:34.742
The Promises are coming true.

17:34.777 --> 17:37.278
Cuddling is the furthest thing
from my mind.

17:37.329 --> 17:40.915
(low vibrating) Then why am I hearing
the house dog's little helper?

17:42.835 --> 17:45.370
I'm not using it
for cuddling anymore.

17:45.454 --> 17:47.705
(vibrating grows louder)

17:51.593 --> 17:53.294
Anyway,

17:53.379 --> 17:54.962
I'm just glad all
this craziness with Kristen

17:55.013 --> 17:56.631
is finally behind us.

17:56.715 --> 17:58.299
Yeah. Me, too.

17:58.384 --> 18:00.301
Or it will be in ten years,

18:00.386 --> 18:02.887
when I'm done giving Arturo
half my inheritance.

18:02.971 --> 18:04.889
Trust me, it's better this way.

18:04.973 --> 18:07.141
If you pay him off all at once,
he'll keep coming back for more.

18:07.226 --> 18:09.944
Doing it in installments
will keep him honest.

18:11.313 --> 18:13.064
Installments.

18:13.148 --> 18:14.816
Yeah?

18:14.900 --> 18:16.651
I-I was looking for
one big withdrawal

18:16.702 --> 18:18.703
from Lonnie's accounts, but...

18:18.787 --> 18:21.989
what if she's been paying
someone off in installments?

18:23.492 --> 18:26.077
Ryan.

18:26.161 --> 18:29.714
I've spent all night going
through my dad's bank accounts,

18:29.798 --> 18:32.250
his transactions, everything
I could get my hands on.

18:32.334 --> 18:33.334
Okay...

18:33.385 --> 18:35.303
Sure.

18:35.337 --> 18:37.505
I've seen this account.

18:37.556 --> 18:40.091
Your father included it
in the trust,

18:40.175 --> 18:41.642
if that's what
you're worried about.

18:41.677 --> 18:44.011
$5,000. Every month,

18:44.096 --> 18:46.814
like clockwork, from
the month he died

18:46.849 --> 18:48.516
going back almost 30 years.

18:48.567 --> 18:50.067
Ryan, I'm confused.

18:50.152 --> 18:51.736
Does this have something
to do with the trust?

18:51.820 --> 18:53.855
You're paying someone off,

18:53.939 --> 18:56.240
someone associated with the
Flock of the Grey Shepherd.

18:56.325 --> 18:58.743
I can only assume this has
to do with my father.

18:58.827 --> 19:00.745
I don't have
the slightest clue what...

19:03.198 --> 19:05.366
You're lying.
Okay,

19:05.417 --> 19:08.586
this is getting inappropriate.
What are you hiding?

19:08.670 --> 19:12.039
I have no idea
what any of this means.

19:12.090 --> 19:13.791
Think about what you're saying,
Ryan.

19:13.876 --> 19:16.093
I met your father in 1992.

19:16.178 --> 19:18.212
You just said these transactions
go back...

19:18.297 --> 19:20.047
30 years.

19:20.098 --> 19:21.799
If your father was involved

19:21.884 --> 19:24.218
in something...

19:24.269 --> 19:28.856
dubious, I promise you
I had nothing to do with it.

19:33.061 --> 19:36.030
I shouldn't be doing this,

19:36.064 --> 19:38.566
but years ago,

19:38.650 --> 19:41.235
when Henry asked me
to be his fiduciary,

19:41.320 --> 19:44.155
he gave me a key to
a storage unit in Culver City.

19:44.239 --> 19:46.457
He said
that if he died suddenly,

19:46.542 --> 19:49.660
I should destroy everything
inside it.

19:49.745 --> 19:52.413
What's in it?

19:52.464 --> 19:55.082
I don't know.

19:55.133 --> 19:57.301
I haven't looked yet.

20:00.088 --> 20:03.474
Hopefully you can find
the answers you're looking for.
