WEBVTT

00:04.588 --> 00:06.465
(groans)

00:06.507 --> 00:09.050
How many more

00:06.507 --> 00:09.050
for the record?

00:09.092 --> 00:11.010
Two more tubs should do it.

00:13.597 --> 00:15.975
There really isn't a category

00:13.597 --> 00:15.975
for eating jalapenos,

00:16.016 --> 00:17.977
but I think he's probably

00:16.016 --> 00:17.977
suffered enough.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.645
I'm going to tell

00:18.018 --> 00:19.645
him in a minute.

00:19.687 --> 00:22.523
(whimpering)

00:22.564 --> 00:26.067
I'm so close to

00:22.564 --> 00:26.067
telling him, honest.

00:26.109 --> 00:27.152
(yells)

00:28.529 --> 00:30.781
Ninty-seven...

00:30.823 --> 00:33.074
Really, I'm going to tell him.

Mom, Dad, can we drive out

01:12.865 --> 01:15.910
to the country this Saturday

01:15.951 --> 01:17.285
to see the meteor shower?

01:17.327 --> 01:20.039
We only have to go, like,

01:17.327 --> 01:20.039
25 miles to get a good view.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.122
It starts around 2:00 a.m.

01:21.164 --> 01:23.751
How's that again, son?

01:23.792 --> 01:24.835
The meteor shower.

01:24.877 --> 01:26.127
They say it's going

01:26.169 --> 01:27.212
to be the best one

01:26.169 --> 01:27.212
in a hundred years.

01:27.254 --> 01:29.214
Sounds science-y.

01:29.256 --> 01:30.382
No, thanks.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.133
Come on, Reese,

01:30.424 --> 01:32.133
a meteor shower.

01:32.175 --> 01:33.719
Fireballs zooming

01:32.175 --> 01:33.719
around the air,

01:33.761 --> 01:35.846
smashing into the ground

01:33.761 --> 01:35.846
right in front of you.

01:35.888 --> 01:36.722
(imitates explosion)

01:36.764 --> 01:37.806
That's not what happens.

01:37.848 --> 01:39.307
Can we ride one?

01:39.349 --> 01:41.142
No! It's 60 miles up,

01:41.184 --> 01:43.144
but it's beautiful

01:41.184 --> 01:43.144
and interesting anyway!

01:43.186 --> 01:45.773
Look, if Malcolm needs to do

01:43.186 --> 01:45.773
this for some school assignment,

01:45.814 --> 01:47.024
then we're going to do it.

01:47.066 --> 01:47.858
It's not for school.

01:47.900 --> 01:49.026
Then forget it.

01:49.068 --> 01:50.444
We're not getting up

01:49.068 --> 01:50.444
at 2:00 a.m.

01:50.485 --> 01:51.946
just to look

01:50.485 --> 01:51.946
at stars.

01:51.987 --> 01:53.948
Bran cereal?

01:53.989 --> 01:55.323
Why are you

01:53.989 --> 01:55.323
eating that stuff?

01:55.365 --> 01:57.158
You said it tastes

01:55.365 --> 01:57.158
like kitty litter.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.160
I'm eating it

01:57.200 --> 01:59.160
because I have to stop

01:59.202 --> 02:00.454
gaining weight.

02:00.495 --> 02:03.164
I've turned into

02:00.495 --> 02:03.164
a gigantic, fat cow.

02:03.206 --> 02:04.165
Oh, you have not.

02:04.207 --> 02:05.250
Even the doctor said so.

02:05.292 --> 02:06.585
Oh, that's ridiculous.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.045
You're eating

02:06.627 --> 02:08.045
for two now.

02:08.087 --> 02:10.171
What kind of doctor

02:08.087 --> 02:10.171
doesn't know that?

02:10.213 --> 02:11.172
Hal, he's right.

02:11.214 --> 02:12.549
I'm huge!

02:12.591 --> 02:15.176
And I don't understand

02:12.591 --> 02:15.176
how it's happening.

02:15.218 --> 02:18.055
Well, I think you're

02:15.218 --> 02:18.055
beautiful no matter what.

02:18.097 --> 02:21.182
Oh, thank you, honey.

02:18.097 --> 02:21.182
You're so sweet.

02:21.224 --> 02:23.477
Oh...

02:27.272 --> 02:29.566
Anything I want to do,

02:27.272 --> 02:29.566
they don't understand.

02:29.608 --> 02:32.193
And if they do understand,

02:29.608 --> 02:32.193
they just make fun of it.

02:32.235 --> 02:34.362
But why should I expect them

02:32.235 --> 02:34.362
to be any different

02:34.404 --> 02:35.781
than the rest

02:34.404 --> 02:35.781
of the world?

02:35.823 --> 02:37.616
Let's face it--

02:35.823 --> 02:37.616
everyone on this planet

02:37.658 --> 02:39.618
is a brain-dead,

02:37.658 --> 02:39.618
butt-scratching half-wit.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.787
Bite... us.

02:41.829 --> 02:45.457
How could you possibly think

02:41.829 --> 02:45.457
that the Nimzovich defense

02:45.499 --> 02:46.708
would work

02:45.499 --> 02:46.708
against me?

02:46.750 --> 02:48.251
You tried it two games ago,

02:48.293 --> 02:50.004
and I slaughtered you.

02:50.045 --> 02:53.256
You tried it four games ago,

02:50.045 --> 02:53.256
and I slaughtered you.

02:53.298 --> 02:56.718
Seriously, how do you find

02:53.298 --> 02:56.718
your way home at night?

02:56.760 --> 03:00.055
What...?

02:56.760 --> 03:00.055
Where-where you going? What?

03:00.097 --> 03:02.223
Oh, okay!

03:02.265 --> 03:03.725
Who wants to play?

03:03.767 --> 03:05.226
Eddie, come on.

03:03.767 --> 03:05.226
I'll tell you what.

03:05.268 --> 03:06.937
I'll hit myself in the head

03:05.268 --> 03:06.937
with a rock.

03:06.979 --> 03:07.938
I'll even it out.

03:07.980 --> 03:09.064
No?

03:09.106 --> 03:10.315
Chubbo?

03:10.357 --> 03:12.943
You can eat with one hand,

03:10.357 --> 03:12.943
play with the other.

03:13.902 --> 03:14.611
Oh, I can't

03:13.902 --> 03:14.611
believe this.

03:14.653 --> 03:17.031
You're all cowards.

03:17.072 --> 03:19.240
Hey, funny-looking kid,

03:19.282 --> 03:21.242
you want to learn

03:19.282 --> 03:21.242
how to play chess?

03:21.284 --> 03:22.243
No, thanks.

03:22.285 --> 03:23.244
Come on.

03:23.286 --> 03:24.913
Look, it's not

03:23.286 --> 03:24.913
that hard.

03:24.955 --> 03:27.248
See, this one looks like

03:24.955 --> 03:27.248
a pretty little horsey.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.625
I know what a knight is.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.418
I also know how to counter

03:28.667 --> 03:30.418
a Nimzovich defense

03:30.460 --> 03:32.629
without leaving my queen's

03:30.460 --> 03:32.629
bishop wide open.

03:32.671 --> 03:34.548
Your whole left flank

03:32.671 --> 03:34.548
was Swiss cheese.

03:34.589 --> 03:37.051
Hey, junior champion.

03:37.092 --> 03:38.259
Read your Kasparov.

03:38.301 --> 03:40.679
The second you go

03:38.301 --> 03:40.679
after my bishop,

03:40.721 --> 03:44.183
you can kiss your rook

03:40.721 --> 03:44.183
and two pawns bye-bye!

03:44.224 --> 03:45.642
Oh, okay, I get it.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.686
You're  scared

03:45.684 --> 03:47.686
to play me!

03:47.728 --> 03:50.772
Yeah, I'm really scared

03:47.728 --> 03:50.772
of some troll in the park

03:50.814 --> 03:52.107
beating me at chess.

03:52.149 --> 03:53.567
Evidently,

03:52.149 --> 03:53.567
you are!

03:53.608 --> 03:55.527
Now you're confusing fear

03:55.569 --> 03:57.154
with pity.

03:57.196 --> 03:59.447
Fear triggers a fight

03:57.196 --> 03:59.447
or flight response

03:59.489 --> 04:00.908
while pity allows me

04:00.949 --> 04:03.326
to turn my back and walk away

04:00.949 --> 04:03.326
with a sadness

04:03.368 --> 04:04.327
for your misery!

04:04.369 --> 04:07.288
I would've

04:04.369 --> 04:07.288
kicked your ass.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.290
All right, that's it.

04:09.332 --> 04:12.002
Couldn't see... that coming.

04:24.389 --> 04:27.184
It's so nice to have

04:24.389 --> 04:27.184
the kids out of the...

04:27.226 --> 04:28.727
Dewey!

04:28.769 --> 04:29.895
What are you doing?!

04:29.937 --> 04:31.563
Painting the wall.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.314
What is the matter

04:31.605 --> 04:33.314
with you?

04:33.356 --> 04:35.358
Why on earth

04:33.356 --> 04:35.358
would you do this?

04:35.400 --> 04:37.318
The baby told me to.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.570
The ba...?

04:38.612 --> 04:40.321
What, this baby?

04:40.363 --> 04:41.990
It chose the color, too.

04:42.032 --> 04:43.992
I would have gone with more

04:42.032 --> 04:43.992
of an earth tone.

04:44.034 --> 04:46.620
Look...

04:46.661 --> 04:50.373
Listen, son, I know you're

04:46.661 --> 04:50.373
worried about the baby coming,

04:50.415 --> 04:52.584
but you don't have to be.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.545
Yes, you're not going to be

04:52.626 --> 04:55.545
the youngest anymore,

04:55.587 --> 04:58.840
and it is true the baby will get

04:55.587 --> 04:58.840
all of our attention

04:58.882 --> 05:02.343
for quite a while, and you will

04:58.882 --> 05:02.343
have to do a lot more work

05:02.385 --> 05:04.429
around the house, and probably

05:02.385 --> 05:04.429
have to share the bathroom...

05:04.471 --> 05:06.347
What your father's

05:04.471 --> 05:06.347
trying to say is,

05:06.389 --> 05:08.600
there is no reason for you

05:06.389 --> 05:08.600
to be acting out like this.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.602
Now get this mess cleaned up.

05:10.644 --> 05:13.147
And the baby is not

05:10.644 --> 05:13.147
talking to you.

05:13.188 --> 05:15.315
It said you'd say that.

05:20.612 --> 05:22.322
Draw.

05:25.408 --> 05:27.244
Draw?

05:30.413 --> 05:32.666
Draw.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.876
Draw.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.461
One more.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.213
No!

05:38.255 --> 05:40.381
It's been four hours!

05:40.423 --> 05:42.550
All right, all right. God.

05:42.592 --> 05:46.387
Who designed these damn

05:42.592 --> 05:46.387
cement benches anyway?

05:46.429 --> 05:47.848
Probably some

05:46.429 --> 05:47.848
stupid civil servant

05:47.889 --> 05:50.184
never made it

05:47.889 --> 05:50.184
through design class.

05:50.225 --> 05:52.393
Now he takes

05:50.225 --> 05:52.393
his frustrations out

05:52.435 --> 05:54.271
on the asses

05:52.435 --> 05:54.271
of the general public.

05:54.313 --> 05:55.856
What the hell

05:54.313 --> 05:55.856
is with that guy?

05:55.897 --> 05:57.316
He is so annoying.

05:57.356 --> 05:59.400
First it's too warm,

05:57.356 --> 05:59.400
then it's too cool,

05:59.442 --> 06:01.402
then the pigeons

05:59.442 --> 06:01.402
are walking funny.

06:01.444 --> 06:02.696
He didn't shut up

06:01.444 --> 06:02.696
for one second.

06:02.737 --> 06:04.405
I mean, give it a try,

06:02.737 --> 06:04.405
stop complaining.

06:04.447 --> 06:05.991
No, you want to know

06:04.447 --> 06:05.991
the worst thing about him?

06:06.033 --> 06:07.534
He kept picking at his...

06:09.619 --> 06:11.788
Four-nine-seven-

06:09.619 --> 06:11.788
three-six-seven...

06:11.830 --> 06:13.081
Stop doing that.

06:13.123 --> 06:14.415
Sorry.

06:14.457 --> 06:15.917
I'll be back in

06:14.457 --> 06:15.917
a couple of hours.

06:15.959 --> 06:16.835
Wait. Where you going?

06:16.877 --> 06:18.003
I told you, I'm posing

06:18.045 --> 06:19.338
in Otto's art class tonight.

06:19.378 --> 06:21.422
Posing? As in naked?

06:21.464 --> 06:23.091
Yes. We had this conversation.

06:23.133 --> 06:24.509
No, we haven't.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.678
I remember conversations

06:24.551 --> 06:26.678
with the word "naked" in them.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.429
You can't strip

06:26.720 --> 06:28.429
in front of Otto.

06:28.471 --> 06:31.308
I'm not spinning my tassels

06:28.471 --> 06:31.308
on a runway, Francis.

06:31.350 --> 06:32.893
I'm modeling at an art class.

06:32.934 --> 06:34.102
It's a job.

06:34.144 --> 06:35.436
They pay $250.

06:35.478 --> 06:36.479
OTTO:

06:35.478 --> 06:36.479
Piama,

06:36.521 --> 06:37.480
I want to make sure

06:37.522 --> 06:38.648
I have the right pastels.

06:38.690 --> 06:39.900
What color

06:38.690 --> 06:39.900
are your nipples?

06:39.941 --> 06:41.109
It's all

06:39.941 --> 06:41.109
very tasteful,

06:41.151 --> 06:42.443
which is beside

06:41.151 --> 06:42.443
the point,

06:42.485 --> 06:44.445
because, guess what,

06:42.485 --> 06:44.445
it's my body,

06:44.487 --> 06:46.447
so you can't tell me

06:44.487 --> 06:46.447
what to do with it.

06:46.489 --> 06:47.741
If you're not

06:46.489 --> 06:47.741
mature enough

06:47.782 --> 06:50.409
to handle this, then

06:47.782 --> 06:50.409
that's your problem.

06:51.328 --> 06:54.413
$250?!

06:56.499 --> 07:00.461
Everything I knew about beauty

06:56.499 --> 07:00.461
was a lie.

07:00.503 --> 07:03.715
So this morning, Dewey tried

07:00.503 --> 07:03.715
to go to school in his underwear

07:03.757 --> 07:06.467
because apparently the baby

07:03.757 --> 07:06.467
doesn't like his wardrobe.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.469
The kid is driving me

07:06.509 --> 07:08.469
up the wall,

07:08.511 --> 07:10.264
and I keep gaining weight

07:08.511 --> 07:10.264
like crazy.

07:10.305 --> 07:11.848
More than a

07:10.305 --> 07:11.848
pound a day.

07:11.890 --> 07:13.725
Nobody gains

07:11.890 --> 07:13.725
a pound a day.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.643
It doesn't make

07:13.767 --> 07:15.643
any sense.

07:15.685 --> 07:16.770
Ah, I know, honey.

07:16.811 --> 07:18.188
It is baffling,

07:18.230 --> 07:20.899
but look, you've just got

07:18.230 --> 07:20.899
to stop obsessing

07:20.941 --> 07:22.483
about this weight thing.

07:22.525 --> 07:23.568
Let me pour you

07:22.525 --> 07:23.568
some juice.

07:23.610 --> 07:24.778
I don't want

07:23.610 --> 07:24.778
any juice, Hal.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.487
I know what's going on.

07:26.529 --> 07:28.698
You do?

07:26.529 --> 07:28.698
Of course I do.

07:28.740 --> 07:29.741
I'm not an idiot.

07:29.783 --> 07:30.909
I-I'm sorry. It's just...

07:30.951 --> 07:32.493
It's because I'm not working.

07:32.535 --> 07:33.578
Huh?

07:33.620 --> 07:34.996
It's obvious, Hal.

07:35.038 --> 07:37.082
I'm not getting the exercise

07:35.038 --> 07:37.082
I got

07:37.124 --> 07:38.541
with the other

07:37.124 --> 07:38.541
pregnancies.

07:38.583 --> 07:39.793
With the other kids,

07:39.834 --> 07:41.669
I was on my feet all day.

07:41.711 --> 07:44.131
Th-That makes perfect sense.

07:44.172 --> 07:45.465
Celery stick?

07:46.967 --> 07:49.177
My system must be

07:46.967 --> 07:49.177
so screwed up.

07:49.219 --> 07:52.055
This celery tastes

07:49.219 --> 07:52.055
exactly like bacon.

07:53.056 --> 07:54.515
Honey, listen to me.

07:54.557 --> 07:57.936
Don't make yourself crazy

07:54.557 --> 07:57.936
over a few pounds.

07:57.978 --> 08:01.481
You look amazing to me.

08:09.572 --> 08:12.367
No matter how big and round

08:12.409 --> 08:14.411
and jiggly you get.

08:17.205 --> 08:20.334
(phone ringing)

08:20.375 --> 08:21.793
Hello.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.253
Hi, Mom.

08:23.295 --> 08:25.213
Tell the baby I got

08:23.295 --> 08:25.213
the stupid pail of sand,

08:25.255 --> 08:27.424
but now the buses

08:25.255 --> 08:27.424
have stopped running

08:27.466 --> 08:28.549
so I can't get home.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.551
Dewey?! Where are you?!

08:30.593 --> 08:31.970
I don't know exactly.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.596
Somewhere down by the pier.

08:33.638 --> 08:34.722
You're at the pier?!

08:34.764 --> 08:35.723
Where?

08:35.765 --> 08:36.808
Dewey, listen to me.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.059
You stay right where you are.

08:38.101 --> 08:39.478
We're coming to get you

08:38.101 --> 08:39.478
right now.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.272
Okay, but bring

08:39.519 --> 08:42.272
another pair of socks.

08:42.314 --> 08:44.274
I stepped in fish guts. Ew.

08:44.316 --> 08:45.775
What is wrong with that kid?

08:45.817 --> 08:47.444
I'm really getting worried.

08:47.486 --> 08:48.987
Let's just stay calm.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.072
We'll get in the car,

08:49.029 --> 08:51.072
go pick up some doughnuts,

08:51.114 --> 08:53.533
and we'll figure this out

08:51.114 --> 08:53.533
on the way.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.912
Another draw?

08:59.498 --> 09:01.749
(music playing)

09:01.791 --> 09:05.379
Hey, Casey Kasem, why don't you

09:01.791 --> 09:05.379
do everybody a favor

09:05.420 --> 09:06.963
and turn that crap down?

09:07.005 --> 09:07.964
It's not loud.

09:08.006 --> 09:09.799
I didn't say it was loud.

09:09.841 --> 09:11.551
I said it was crap.

09:12.635 --> 09:15.596
So, uh, is this all

09:12.635 --> 09:15.596
you do every day?

09:15.638 --> 09:17.640
Just hang out

09:15.638 --> 09:17.640
in the park

09:17.682 --> 09:20.477
and play chess

09:17.682 --> 09:20.477
with strangers?

09:20.519 --> 09:23.230
No.

09:23.271 --> 09:27.067
I also enjoy long walks

09:23.271 --> 09:27.067
on the beach and bubble baths.

09:27.108 --> 09:31.196
Of course, I'd have to say

09:27.108 --> 09:31.196
my greatest turn-on is honesty.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.614
So basically,

09:31.238 --> 09:33.614
the only human contact you have

09:33.656 --> 09:36.617
is playing chess with people

09:33.656 --> 09:36.617
who can't stand you?

09:36.659 --> 09:40.455
I hate to burst your little

09:36.659 --> 09:40.455
after-school-special bubble,

09:40.497 --> 09:42.499
but I'm not some kind of loser.

09:42.541 --> 09:43.875
I have a perfect life.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.711
I have a great job

09:43.917 --> 09:46.711
selling toner over the phone.

09:46.753 --> 09:49.297
I make a few calls--

09:46.753 --> 09:49.297
bing, bang, bing, it's 10:00.

09:49.339 --> 09:51.132
I've got the rest

09:49.339 --> 09:51.132
of the day to myself.

09:51.174 --> 09:53.051
You can't possibly make

09:51.174 --> 09:53.051
enough money doing that.

09:53.093 --> 09:55.720
I thought you were a little

09:53.093 --> 09:55.720
smarter than that, Malcolm.

09:55.762 --> 09:58.557
It's not about money.

09:55.762 --> 09:58.557
It's about freedom.

09:58.598 --> 09:59.849
I am my own man.

09:59.891 --> 10:02.643
I do what I want, when I want.

10:02.685 --> 10:06.565
I don't answer to anyone

10:02.685 --> 10:06.565
for anything, ever.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.025
Where's my 20 bucks, Leonard?

10:09.067 --> 10:10.818
You said you'd

10:09.067 --> 10:10.818
have it on Monday.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.362
Yeah, I have it,

10:10.860 --> 10:12.362
It's right here.

10:12.404 --> 10:14.114
I... you know, I was...

10:12.404 --> 10:14.114
I was looking for you.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.949
You know, I couldn't find you,

10:15.990 --> 10:17.700
and then I had some

10:15.990 --> 10:17.700
important business meetings

10:17.742 --> 10:21.580
that I had to get to,

10:17.742 --> 10:21.580
but here... 13, 14...

10:21.621 --> 10:22.830
Um, uh, you take

10:22.872 --> 10:24.332
cigarettes, right?

10:24.374 --> 10:25.666
I quit.

10:25.708 --> 10:26.667
Oh, good for you.

10:26.709 --> 10:27.919
That's so good

10:26.709 --> 10:27.919
because, you know,

10:27.961 --> 10:29.504
these things will

10:27.961 --> 10:29.504
kill you slow.

10:29.546 --> 10:30.922
Th-That's the truth,

10:29.546 --> 10:30.922
you know, and...

10:30.964 --> 10:32.673
and the cost is...

10:35.343 --> 10:37.178
Give him six bucks!

10:42.601 --> 10:44.102
Take it easy, George.

10:46.729 --> 10:48.898
What a dumbass!

10:58.116 --> 10:59.700
Well, I'm afraid

10:58.116 --> 10:59.700
time's up, everyone,

10:59.742 --> 11:02.579
but once again,

10:59.742 --> 11:02.579
let's thank our models

11:02.621 --> 11:05.039
for their hard work.

11:08.418 --> 11:10.337
Thank you.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.713
I'm just glad I had

11:10.378 --> 11:12.713
this opportunity

11:12.755 --> 11:14.382
to give something back.

11:14.424 --> 11:16.134
You were just wonderful,

11:14.424 --> 11:16.134
as always.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.718
Well, that's what I do.

11:17.760 --> 11:19.220
Oh, and Piama did well,

11:17.760 --> 11:19.220
too, don't you think?

11:20.639 --> 11:22.807
Francis, you have inspired me

11:20.639 --> 11:22.807
to new heights.

11:22.849 --> 11:24.351
See how I have captured

11:24.392 --> 11:26.353
the confident power

11:24.392 --> 11:26.353
of your torso,

11:26.394 --> 11:28.313
the sheer arrogance

11:26.394 --> 11:28.313
of your ass.

11:28.355 --> 11:29.523
PIAMA:

11:28.355 --> 11:29.523
Francis,

11:29.564 --> 11:30.815
come on, let's go.

11:30.857 --> 11:32.984
I'm talking to people here,

11:30.857 --> 11:32.984
if you don't mind.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.614
Sadly, someone's

11:35.362 --> 11:37.614
doing this  with  his soul,

11:37.656 --> 11:40.241
and somebody isn't.

11:42.410 --> 11:43.537
Hi, Mom.

11:43.578 --> 11:45.539
Hi, Dewey.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.499
(van door closes, engine starts)

11:48.791 --> 11:51.545
LOIS: You get in

11:48.791 --> 11:51.545
that house right now, mister!

11:51.586 --> 11:53.796
The baby did not tell you

11:51.586 --> 11:53.796
to drive the car!

11:53.838 --> 11:55.756
Well, it didn't exactly

11:53.838 --> 11:55.756
use the word "car."

11:55.798 --> 11:58.176
It called it a "go machine,"

11:55.798 --> 11:58.176
but that's what it meant.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.760
What's this?

11:59.802 --> 12:01.596
Somebody had a birthday

11:59.802 --> 12:01.596
at the office,

12:01.638 --> 12:03.640
and nobody ate it

12:01.638 --> 12:03.640
because it's "fat-free."

12:03.682 --> 12:05.766
How come it doesn't say

12:03.682 --> 12:05.766
"happy birthday" or anything?

12:05.808 --> 12:08.769
Well, you know, office politics,

12:05.808 --> 12:08.769
but you wouldn't believe

12:08.811 --> 12:11.398
how PC some of

12:08.811 --> 12:11.398
these jerks can get.

12:12.106 --> 12:14.025
♪ ♪

12:35.338 --> 12:37.632
♪ ♪

12:46.765 --> 12:48.809
Look at this.

12:48.851 --> 12:50.270
I'm looking.

12:51.854 --> 12:52.980
You're really improving, Rubio.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.815
You've stopped making

12:53.022 --> 12:54.815
the "vroom" noises

12:54.857 --> 12:56.234
when you move your pieces.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.444
Hey, Leonard.

12:57.485 --> 12:59.112
Oh, you got to see this.

13:00.779 --> 13:03.199
Physically hurts, doesn't it?

13:03.241 --> 13:05.034
Listen, I was talking

13:03.241 --> 13:05.034
to this guy I know.

13:05.076 --> 13:06.411
I got you a job interview.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.204
What the hell are

13:06.453 --> 13:08.204
you talking about?

13:08.246 --> 13:09.914
You are a miserable person.

13:09.956 --> 13:12.709
You barely have a job, and

13:09.956 --> 13:12.709
you're completely dysfunctional

13:12.751 --> 13:14.835
when it comes to

13:12.751 --> 13:14.835
communicating with people.

13:14.877 --> 13:16.254
And that's my fault?

13:16.296 --> 13:18.839
It's not everyone else

13:16.296 --> 13:18.839
in the world?

13:18.881 --> 13:20.467
It doesn't have

13:18.881 --> 13:20.467
to be like that.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.843
If you have a job where

13:20.508 --> 13:22.843
you're around people,

13:22.885 --> 13:26.055
you can get used to each other

13:22.885 --> 13:26.055
and maybe turn things around.

13:26.097 --> 13:27.848
Forget it.

13:26.097 --> 13:27.848
I'm not wasting my time

13:27.890 --> 13:30.017
on some stupid job interview

13:27.890 --> 13:30.017
because you have

13:30.059 --> 13:32.853
some desperate need

13:30.059 --> 13:32.853
to save yourself through me.

13:32.895 --> 13:35.231
Why don't you invest some

13:32.895 --> 13:35.231
of that neurotic energy

13:35.273 --> 13:37.317
in confronting your

13:35.273 --> 13:37.317
own fear of failure?

13:37.358 --> 13:40.737
Oh, goodness,

13:37.358 --> 13:40.737
the clouds have parted,

13:40.779 --> 13:42.863
and I can now commit

13:40.779 --> 13:42.863
to a new life,

13:42.905 --> 13:46.326
thanks to your Oprah-esque

13:42.905 --> 13:46.326
psychological insights.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.911
And now you're trying to

13:46.367 --> 13:48.911
invalidate the real issue

13:48.953 --> 13:51.247
by dancing around it

13:48.953 --> 13:51.247
with what you think

13:51.289 --> 13:52.624
is clever wordplay.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.252
Screw this.

13:56.294 --> 13:58.879
I'll play you for it.

13:58.921 --> 14:00.674
Why bother? We

13:58.921 --> 14:00.674
draw every game.

14:00.715 --> 14:01.882
Not this time.

14:00.715 --> 14:01.882
Fine.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.343
But if you don't win,

14:03.384 --> 14:04.927
you never bring

14:03.384 --> 14:04.927
this crap up again.

14:04.969 --> 14:06.179
You're on.

14:19.526 --> 14:20.901
Where's my money, Leonard?

14:20.943 --> 14:24.905
George, uh, I got it, uh,

14:20.943 --> 14:24.905
just the other...

14:26.866 --> 14:28.868
Run!

14:31.621 --> 14:33.790
So, how much does this job pay?

14:35.249 --> 14:36.417
What are you doing?

14:36.459 --> 14:38.753
Can you hold these

14:36.459 --> 14:38.753
for a second?

14:38.795 --> 14:40.129
Sure.

14:45.009 --> 14:46.553
What's this for, anyway?

14:46.594 --> 14:47.887
You'll see.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.226
Are you crazy?

14:53.267 --> 14:54.644
It wasn't my idea.

14:54.686 --> 14:56.187
The baby told me to.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.231
Wait a minute-- Mom's baby?

14:58.272 --> 15:00.941
You think Mom's baby

14:58.272 --> 15:00.941
talks to you?

15:00.983 --> 15:02.402
Yes!

15:02.443 --> 15:04.362
It's telling me to do

15:02.443 --> 15:04.362
all these crazy things.

15:05.279 --> 15:06.823
Let me give you

15:05.279 --> 15:06.823
a little advice.

15:06.865 --> 15:08.783
You've got to ignore the voices.

15:08.825 --> 15:11.578
They are not on your side,

15:08.825 --> 15:11.578
and you never tell

15:11.619 --> 15:13.954
anyone about them--

15:11.619 --> 15:13.954
especially your teachers.

15:13.996 --> 15:15.665
They get panicky for no reason.

15:15.707 --> 15:16.750
You understand?

15:16.791 --> 15:18.752
I think so.

15:16.791 --> 15:18.752
Attaboy.

15:18.793 --> 15:21.045
You're going to be okay.

15:24.173 --> 15:25.633
This is a terrible idea.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.385
No, this is

15:25.675 --> 15:27.385
just what you need.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.220
Remember?

15:27.427 --> 15:29.220
A job, people, a life.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.555
But why  here?

15:30.597 --> 15:32.223
Because this is

15:30.597 --> 15:32.223
the only guy I know

15:32.265 --> 15:33.974
that would trade

15:32.265 --> 15:33.974
a job interview

15:34.016 --> 15:35.602
for a Hong Kong Fooey

15:34.016 --> 15:35.602
lunch box.

15:35.643 --> 15:37.729
Greetings, Earthlings.

15:39.021 --> 15:41.190
You've got to

15:39.021 --> 15:41.190
be kidding me.

15:41.232 --> 15:43.192
Trust me, I know

15:41.232 --> 15:43.192
it's going to be hard,

15:43.234 --> 15:45.361
but if you can just

15:43.234 --> 15:45.361
keep your mouth shut

15:45.403 --> 15:47.988
for five minutes with this guy,

15:45.403 --> 15:47.988
you're home free.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.990
I'm waiting, princess.

15:50.032 --> 15:51.659
(growling)

15:57.039 --> 15:58.792
My résumé.

15:58.833 --> 16:01.001
(chuckles)

15:58.833 --> 16:01.001
Forget this.

16:01.043 --> 16:04.004
You can't learn

16:01.043 --> 16:04.004
anything from a résumé.

16:04.046 --> 16:06.966
So, tell me about

16:04.046 --> 16:06.966
your employment history.

16:09.218 --> 16:11.011
Well, I...

16:11.053 --> 16:14.641
Interesting. You know,

16:11.053 --> 16:14.641
I like to think of Lucky Aide

16:14.682 --> 16:17.393
as a kind of family,

16:14.682 --> 16:17.393
and in this family,

16:17.435 --> 16:18.853
I'd be your father,

16:18.895 --> 16:20.271
and as a father,

16:20.313 --> 16:21.689
there might be things

16:21.731 --> 16:23.650
I might ask of you

16:21.731 --> 16:23.650
that don't make sense,

16:23.691 --> 16:26.277
but you do it because

16:23.691 --> 16:26.277
I'm your father.

16:26.319 --> 16:29.029
No sassing back, just do it.

16:29.071 --> 16:30.281
Understand?

16:34.076 --> 16:35.035
Think so.

16:35.077 --> 16:36.036
Now,

16:36.078 --> 16:38.247
who are  you  in this family?

16:39.081 --> 16:41.041
Are you the second cousin?

16:41.083 --> 16:43.544
Or maybe the kooky aunt?

16:48.090 --> 16:51.469
Well, you know, I've always

16:48.090 --> 16:51.469
kind of seen myself

16:51.511 --> 16:55.222
in the role

16:51.511 --> 16:55.222
of the younger brother--

16:55.264 --> 16:56.975
eager to learn.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.268
I never had a brother.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.231
Well, I'm here.

17:04.273 --> 17:07.067
We can get started

17:04.273 --> 17:07.067
in a moment.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.529
Francis, I-I didn't call you.

17:09.570 --> 17:10.947
Yes, I noticed.

17:10.989 --> 17:13.658
I can't do your

17:10.989 --> 17:13.658
job  and  mine, Gloria.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.576
What? There's no Camembert?

17:15.618 --> 17:18.078
You expect me to have my wine

17:15.618 --> 17:18.078
without any Camembert?

17:18.120 --> 17:20.080
That ruins

17:18.120 --> 17:20.080
my entire aesthetic!

17:20.122 --> 17:22.000
Francis...

17:20.122 --> 17:22.000
Forget it.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.043
I'll work without cheese.

17:25.795 --> 17:27.087
Who is this?

17:27.129 --> 17:29.757
That's Jeremy,

17:27.129 --> 17:29.757
our model for the evening.

17:29.799 --> 17:31.091
That's why I didn't call you.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.677
OTTO:

17:31.133 --> 17:32.677
Francis,

17:32.719 --> 17:35.596
we have already sketched

17:32.719 --> 17:35.596
your fabulous haunches,

17:35.638 --> 17:38.098
and now it is time

17:35.638 --> 17:38.098
for us to examine

17:38.140 --> 17:42.102
the interplay of light and

17:38.140 --> 17:42.102
shadow on Jeremy's love handles.

17:42.144 --> 17:43.187
That's it?

17:43.229 --> 17:44.814
That's how it ends?

17:44.856 --> 17:48.568
You just casually discard me

17:44.856 --> 17:48.568
like yesterday's fish?

17:48.609 --> 17:51.487
After you've sucked out

17:48.609 --> 17:51.487
the essence of my soul?

17:51.529 --> 17:53.155
Francis, please,

17:51.529 --> 17:53.155
try to understand.

17:53.197 --> 17:55.115
No, I  don't  understand!

17:55.157 --> 17:58.411
I let you see every color

17:55.157 --> 17:58.411
in the spectrum of my being,

17:58.452 --> 18:00.120
and you have rejected it!

18:00.162 --> 18:03.123
Someday, you'll realize

18:00.162 --> 18:03.123
what you turned your back on,

18:03.165 --> 18:04.709
and you will

18:03.165 --> 18:04.709
curse yourself

18:04.751 --> 18:07.336
for your banality

18:04.751 --> 18:07.336
and your shortsightedness,

18:07.378 --> 18:10.840
but by then it will be too late

18:07.378 --> 18:10.840
because I will be gone!

18:13.175 --> 18:14.635
Yes, gone!

18:21.642 --> 18:24.103
Um... can I have my robe?

18:27.440 --> 18:30.026
Craig's been yammering nonstop

18:27.440 --> 18:30.026
for almost an hour.

18:30.068 --> 18:32.319
He even made Leonard

18:30.068 --> 18:32.319
follow him into the bathroom,

18:32.361 --> 18:33.654
but Leonard's tough.

18:33.696 --> 18:37.992
Now, let's talk

18:33.696 --> 18:37.992
about respect--

18:38.034 --> 18:41.245
not self-respect but respect

18:38.034 --> 18:41.245
for one's superiors.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.205
Now I remember a

18:41.287 --> 18:43.205
time... think quick!

18:43.247 --> 18:45.165
That's just a little

18:45.207 --> 18:47.167
management test

18:45.207 --> 18:47.167
I came up with

18:47.209 --> 18:48.962
to see whether you're

18:47.209 --> 18:48.962
the type of person

18:49.003 --> 18:52.172
who confronts problems head-on

18:49.003 --> 18:52.172
or avoids them.

18:52.214 --> 18:54.133
Which one were you?

18:57.053 --> 18:58.178
Both.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.597
Good.

19:10.232 --> 19:13.486
And I see that

19:10.232 --> 19:13.486
you have no spine.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.195
Welcome aboard.

19:15.237 --> 19:16.572
Come back in an hour,

19:16.614 --> 19:19.492
and we'll get you

19:16.614 --> 19:19.492
a trainee vest and a name tag.

19:20.701 --> 19:22.870
Congratulations.

19:20.701 --> 19:22.870
I knew you could do it.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.831
Oh, my God, that

19:22.912 --> 19:24.831
guy is an idiot.

19:24.872 --> 19:27.207
You only had to do

19:24.872 --> 19:27.207
an interview with him.

19:27.249 --> 19:29.376
Trying having dinner

19:27.249 --> 19:29.376
with that jackass

19:29.418 --> 19:30.837
and his stupid cat.

19:30.878 --> 19:33.213
The cat can't be

19:30.878 --> 19:33.213
any stupider than this guy.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.508
This moron just tried

19:33.255 --> 19:35.508
to use a Barbie doll

19:35.549 --> 19:37.718
to explain

19:35.549 --> 19:37.718
the hygiene procedures.

19:38.469 --> 19:40.262
Brother, huh?

19:40.304 --> 19:43.182
I think I'll stay

19:40.304 --> 19:43.182
an only child, thank you.

19:54.527 --> 19:57.321
Mom! Dad!

19:58.280 --> 19:59.448
Dewey!

20:00.491 --> 20:01.367
(both gasp)

20:04.286 --> 20:05.454
Oh, right.

20:08.958 --> 20:10.543
I have had it

20:08.958 --> 20:10.543
with you, Dewey.

20:10.584 --> 20:13.462
I have enough on my mind without

20:10.584 --> 20:13.462
having to deal with this!

20:13.504 --> 20:14.630
But the baby says...

20:14.672 --> 20:15.756
Listen to me.

20:15.798 --> 20:17.257
That baby is not

20:15.798 --> 20:17.257
talking to you.

20:17.299 --> 20:19.552
Honey, just try

20:17.299 --> 20:19.552
to calm down, okay?

20:19.593 --> 20:21.054
I'll make you some tea.

20:21.095 --> 20:22.262
You have to stop using this

20:22.304 --> 20:23.764
as an excuse to get attention,

20:23.806 --> 20:25.307
because it is not

20:23.806 --> 20:25.307
going to work!

20:25.349 --> 20:27.267
Now, I don't want to

20:25.349 --> 20:27.267
hear another word

20:27.309 --> 20:29.311
about you talking to

20:27.309 --> 20:29.311
that baby, understand?

20:29.353 --> 20:30.938
The baby says

20:29.353 --> 20:30.938
to turn around.

20:30.980 --> 20:32.148
What?

20:34.817 --> 20:36.610
(gasps)

20:37.361 --> 20:38.905
Hal.

20:38.946 --> 20:41.615
Well, you don't take yours

20:38.946 --> 20:41.615
with maple syrup?

20:42.909 --> 20:44.785
Craig was pretty upset.

20:44.827 --> 20:48.288
He wouldn't come out of the

20:44.827 --> 20:48.288
photo booth for two hours.

20:48.330 --> 20:50.083
Where's Leonard?

20:50.124 --> 20:51.792
Has anyone seen Leonard?

20:51.834 --> 20:54.378
He told me to give this to you.

20:55.337 --> 20:58.340
"Malcolm, I moved away,

20:58.382 --> 20:59.884
"but I want to thank you

20:59.926 --> 21:01.510
"for confirming

20:59.926 --> 21:01.510
everything I said

21:01.552 --> 21:03.345
"about people being

21:01.552 --> 21:03.345
giant jackasses.

21:03.387 --> 21:04.805
"One day you'll

21:03.387 --> 21:04.805
understand.

21:04.847 --> 21:08.392
People like us

21:04.847 --> 21:08.392
will never belong."

21:08.434 --> 21:10.978
What does he mean,

21:08.434 --> 21:10.978
"people like us"?

21:14.398 --> 21:17.526
What?

21:14.398 --> 21:17.526
I hate when you do that.

21:18.652 --> 21:19.319
If you have something

21:18.652 --> 21:19.319
to say, just say it.

21:19.361 --> 21:20.279
That is  so  annoying.
