00:15.223 --> 00:19.037
I wonder if she'll come back again.
I wonder if she comes again.

00:20.039 --> 00:22.110
I wonder if she'll come back again.

00:22.890 --> 00:24.986
I wonder if she comes again.

00:25.266 --> 00:28.657
I wonder if she'll come back again.
I wonder if she comes again.

00:28.737 --> 00:30.422
I wonder...

00:34.997 --> 00:38.550
I wonder if she comes tonight.
I wonder what games we'll play.

00:39.029 --> 00:41.951
If she comes again tonight,
I wonder what games we'll play.

00:57.132 --> 01:00.023
Okay, that sounds fun.

01:08.566 --> 01:10.368
Her name's Alice.

01:10.648 --> 01:12.471
She's six.

01:37.035 --> 01:39.526
Ready or not, here I come.

01:46.770 --> 01:48.271
Liam?

01:56.772 --> 01:58.528
Where are you?

02:01.837 --> 02:03.926
Liam, you're sleep walking again.

02:07.672 --> 02:10.529
There you are, next to my sister.

02:12.971 --> 02:15.461
This isn't funny. I'm gonna tell Mom.

02:20.223 --> 02:22.492
Liam, you're scaring me.

02:22.572 --> 02:26.426
- Get away from me!
- Liam, stop it!

02:26.506 --> 02:29.996
Alice! Help me! Alice!

02:32.160 --> 02:35.687
The word 'nightmare' is derived
from the Old English word 'Mare...'

02:35.767 --> 02:38.781
...a demon that torments people
with horrifying dreams.

02:40.242 --> 02:44.256
Millions claim to encounter this demon
while trapped in 'sleep paralysis...'

02:44.336 --> 02:46.584
...a state between wakefulness and sleep.

02:48.150 --> 02:50.661
The following is inspired by real accounts.

02:51.359 --> 02:54.397
<i>So why don't you tell me
a little bit about your nightmare?</i>

02:56.175 --> 02:58.262
<i>I first saw it as a child...</i>

02:58.642 --> 03:01.096
<i>...standing in the shadows
at the end of my bed.</i>

03:02.575 --> 03:05.198
<i>It's hard to describe what it looks like.</i>

03:06.077 --> 03:07.931
<i>This figure in the darkness.</i>

03:09.310 --> 03:11.163
<i>It didn't have a face.</i>

03:11.842 --> 03:14.731
<i>I wake up. I can't move.</i>

03:15.610 --> 03:17.831
<i>Like I'm paralyzed.</i>

03:17.911 --> 03:20.532
<i>The room gets darker and darker.</i>

03:21.311 --> 03:23.364
<i>That's when I know it's coming.</i>

03:23.943 --> 03:25.897
<i>It happens to me every night.</i>

03:25.977 --> 03:27.831
<i>I don't wanna sleep any more.</i>

03:27.911 --> 03:30.699
<i>And there's this pressure on my chest...</i>

03:30.778 --> 03:32.732
<i>...this huge force.</i>

03:32.811 --> 03:35.632
<i>It's like something's holding you down.</i>

03:36.111 --> 03:38.566
- <i>I feel terrified.</i>
- <i>I knew it was there.</i>

03:38.646 --> 03:43.500
<i>I could feel it in the darkness
just... watching me.</i>

03:43.580 --> 03:46.534
<i>I feel trapped. I wasn't able
to move any part of my body.</i>

03:46.614 --> 03:48.933
<i>I could only move my eyes back and forth.</i>

03:49.013 --> 03:51.959
<i>And then I saw this figure
coming towards me...</i>

03:52.039 --> 03:55.401
<i>...and I couldn't make it out,
because it was black.</i>

03:55.481 --> 03:58.468
<i>You'd be surprised
how many people are affected.</i>

03:58.548 --> 04:01.367
<i>I think some people
don't even like to talk about it.</i>

04:01.447 --> 04:06.435
<i>Every fiber of your body is
telling you it's something evil.</i>

04:06.515 --> 04:10.768
<i>It looks like this old woman,
a haggard old woman...</i>

04:10.848 --> 04:14.902
<i>...with these cold, dark eyes.</i>

04:15.682 --> 04:19.170
<i>It's not like a nightmare,
it's... it's something else.</i>

04:19.749 --> 04:22.185
<i>It had such power.</i>

04:22.265 --> 04:24.864
<i>I felt completely helpless.</i>

04:24.944 --> 04:28.204
<i>You don't know what it's like.
It's like a curse.</i>

04:28.284 --> 04:31.470
<i>You wanna run, you wanna
scream, but it won't let you.</i>

04:31.550 --> 04:35.071
- <i>The thing was well over six foot.</i>
- <i>I think it was seven feet tall.</i>

04:35.151 --> 04:37.304
<i>It was like this moving darkness.</i>

04:37.384 --> 04:40.304
<i>It was the greatest terror
I've ever experienced.</i>

04:40.384 --> 04:42.770
<i>The shadow man is violent.</i>

04:42.850 --> 04:46.404
<i>The hag, she takes hold of me,
and I think I'm gonna die.</i>

04:46.484 --> 04:48.938
<i>Well, you know it's coming back.</i>

04:49.018 --> 04:51.836
<i>And is always coming back for you.</i>

04:57.386 --> 04:58.943
<i>Alice!</i>

05:05.387 --> 05:07.641
Were your dreams sweet, Mummy?

05:08.520 --> 05:10.740
Not as sweet as you.

05:11.220 --> 05:13.112
Good morning.

05:15.622 --> 05:17.511
Good morning.

05:18.887 --> 05:21.345
One, two, three.

05:22.587 --> 05:25.121
Always, always, always.

05:48.723 --> 05:52.364
<i># Dream, dream, dream,
dream, dream, dream #</i>

05:52.444 --> 05:54.676
Has Henry had his breakfast yet?

05:54.756 --> 05:57.611
He had six peanuts.

05:57.990 --> 05:59.733
- Six.
- Oh, six.

05:59.813 --> 06:02.078
- You ready for your test?
- Yeah.

06:02.158 --> 06:04.778
- Ah, excuse me.
- Yes!

06:05.558 --> 06:09.412
- Who's this?
- Um, it's you. You're flying.

06:10.151 --> 06:13.491
- Oh, super mom!
- It's very nice.

06:13.571 --> 06:15.446
Where am I flying to?

06:15.526 --> 06:17.713
I don't know. Nowhere, I guess.

06:17.793 --> 06:19.646
Do you like it?

06:20.426 --> 06:22.279
I love it.

06:22.858 --> 06:25.653
One, two, three.

06:25.733 --> 06:27.747
Oh, my gosh, every time.

06:27.827 --> 06:30.448
Loser! You can't kiss the artist.

06:30.528 --> 06:34.106
- Yes, I can.
- Okay, artist, time to go.

06:34.186 --> 06:36.947
<i>And I kept trying to breathe
and I couldn't breathe...</i>

06:37.027 --> 06:41.382
<i>...and I was telling myself,
like, Michelle, wake up.</i>

06:41.462 --> 06:43.839
<i>Wake up. Breathe.</i>

06:43.919 --> 06:46.581
<i>Get out of bed. Move.</i>

06:46.661 --> 06:51.149
<i>Like, do something,
you're okay, but I couldn't.</i>

06:51.229 --> 06:56.021
So, in turn, her brain is not
allowing her to go into REM-deep sleep.

06:56.101 --> 06:58.681
This is what's causing her
parasomnia episodes...

06:58.761 --> 07:01.416
...sleep talking, scary night terrors.

07:01.895 --> 07:05.351
Seeing things that aren't really there, yeah.

07:06.530 --> 07:09.251
You know, it's a lot more common
condition than you might think.

07:09.331 --> 07:12.418
Even my own daughter,
she goes through this sometimes.

07:13.197 --> 07:17.543
And because of what we know now,
it's easily treatable.

07:20.331 --> 07:24.251
Hm, today's dream drawing, who is it?

07:24.331 --> 07:26.518
It's meant to be me, flying.

07:26.597 --> 07:28.851
Hm, floating more like.

07:28.931 --> 07:33.551
- If I drew my dreams, I'd get arrested.
- That's because you're a sociopath, Malcolm.

07:33.631 --> 07:35.922
Shh, they'll hear.

07:37.433 --> 07:39.116
What about you?

07:39.665 --> 07:41.253
What about me?

07:41.333 --> 07:44.652
What creepy things have you got
lurking in your dreams?

07:44.732 --> 07:47.221
Dr. Arnolds, the Morgans have arrived.

07:48.300 --> 07:50.119
I thought they weren't coming until 3:00?

07:50.199 --> 07:53.821
I told them they were early,
but they seemed a little... on edge.

07:54.650 --> 07:56.190
Okay.

07:58.734 --> 08:01.488
Why don't you tell me a little bit
about what's been going on?

08:01.567 --> 08:04.417
Um, about two months ago...

08:05.435 --> 08:07.894
...our baby boy, he...

08:08.566 --> 08:11.988
He passed away... in his sleep.

08:12.867 --> 08:14.421
- Let it go.
- Stop it!

08:14.500 --> 08:17.822
- Charlie, please.
- I'm so sorry.

08:17.902 --> 08:20.304
Um, around the same time...

08:20.385 --> 08:24.564
...we started to find Daniel...

08:24.644 --> 08:27.757
...um... sleepwalking
and... and sleep talking...

08:27.837 --> 08:30.037
...sometimes even screaming.

08:30.636 --> 08:33.563
He's had episodes like this before, but...

08:33.643 --> 08:37.833
...then we started to find him asleep...

08:37.914 --> 08:41.366
...we think, but with his eyes open...

08:42.046 --> 08:44.857
...chest heaving, trying to talk...

08:44.937 --> 08:48.092
...but his whole body's paralyzed.

08:48.971 --> 08:52.791
Daniel, you've been experiencing
sleep paralysis.

08:52.871 --> 08:56.426
That's when you think you're awake
but your brain is still dreaming.

08:57.005 --> 09:00.296
You can open your eyes and look around
the room, but your body can't move...

09:00.445 --> 09:04.114
...because you're still asleep.
You feel trapped.

09:04.194 --> 09:06.859
Your mind tells you that there's
something else in the room.

09:06.939 --> 09:10.629
Something bad, something
pressing down on your chest.

09:13.806 --> 09:17.527
It's all up here, honey.
It's all in our imagination.

09:17.607 --> 09:21.261
I know it can be scary,
but there are no ghosts or goblins.

09:21.341 --> 09:24.431
See, honey, what did I tell you? Huh?

09:27.975 --> 09:32.736
Why don't both of you come
and get one of these? Mm.

09:34.707 --> 09:36.027
- What do you say?
- Thank you.

09:36.107 --> 09:38.649
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

09:42.575 --> 09:46.262
Losing a loved one, as you both know
can take a very heavy psychological toll...

09:46.342 --> 09:47.729
...especially on children.

09:47.809 --> 09:51.475
So I wouldn't be surprised
if this tragedy acted as a trigger...

09:51.555 --> 09:53.497
...for Daniel's nocturnal behavior.

09:53.577 --> 09:57.664
But, you know, we will run
some tests while he's here and...

09:57.744 --> 09:58.964
...you know, I wouldn't worry.

09:59.044 --> 10:02.930
I haven't run into a single person
whose issues haven't been resolvable.

10:03.010 --> 10:04.365
But it's not just him.

10:04.444 --> 10:09.490
We've all started
having these terrible dreams.

10:09.570 --> 10:12.664
- Sleepwalking and sleep talking.
- I'm sorry, I'm confused.

10:12.744 --> 10:15.733
Which one of you is staying
with us tomorrow night?

10:15.813 --> 10:17.636
All of us.

10:32.147 --> 10:33.600
Okay.

10:33.680 --> 10:37.044
- Thank you, my dear.
- You're welcome.

10:37.124 --> 10:39.573
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight, Mr. Futterman.

10:55.415 --> 10:58.685
And when Gretel opened her apron,
the pearls and precious stones...

10:58.765 --> 11:00.648
...were scattered all over the room...

11:00.728 --> 11:04.903
...and Hansel took one handful
after another out of his pocket.

11:04.983 --> 11:07.137
Then was all care at an end...

11:07.218 --> 11:10.421
...and they lived happily ever after.

11:12.600 --> 11:15.622
When the witch died, did she go to heaven?

11:16.951 --> 11:18.972
Not everybody gets into heaven.

11:20.350 --> 11:23.442
Only the good people, like your baby brother.

11:28.352 --> 11:30.405
Time for bed, Daniel.

11:31.185 --> 11:33.472
I don't wanna go to sleep.

11:33.552 --> 11:36.938
Then why don't you do your multiplication
tables like the nice doctor said.

11:37.018 --> 11:39.244
So you won't think about the bad things.

11:49.720 --> 11:51.806
I don't want it to come again.

11:51.886 --> 11:54.572
Oh, sweetie, that's just a nightmare...

11:54.652 --> 11:56.674
...but this is a good, strong house...

11:56.754 --> 11:59.373
...with good, strong, brave children.

11:59.853 --> 12:01.741
Show me the money.

12:02.021 --> 12:05.112
Grrr. Mini muscle man.

12:07.555 --> 12:10.613
- Can Alfie sleep with us tonight?
- Sure.

12:14.488 --> 12:17.513
Love you both. Sleep tight.

12:30.255 --> 12:32.040
Dr. Arnolds!

12:32.889 --> 12:34.744
Dammit, Cam!

12:34.824 --> 12:36.409
Sorry.

12:36.889 --> 12:40.643
Oh, gosh. I have to get this coffee
to Malcolm in observation.

12:40.723 --> 12:43.284
He's probably having a caffeine
melt-down by now.

12:43.364 --> 12:46.945
Hey, what do you guys do
in that little cave anyway?

12:47.025 --> 12:50.646
The observation room? We observe.

12:51.225 --> 12:53.083
Oh, that's genius.

13:12.959 --> 13:16.424
Two times three is six.

13:19.360 --> 13:21.407
Three times three...

13:22.693 --> 13:24.285
...nine.

13:26.361 --> 13:29.386
Four times three, twelve.

13:31.361 --> 13:35.052
Five times three, fifteen.

13:36.394 --> 13:40.143
Six times three, eighteen.

13:47.662 --> 13:50.317
Maybe it's safer if I stay
on the couch tonight?

13:51.097 --> 13:54.687
- You know, just in case...
- No...

13:54.767 --> 13:56.766
...I want you here.

13:57.556 --> 13:59.434
Close to me.

14:02.047 --> 14:05.689
It's gonna be okay, we'll figure it out.

15:02.770 --> 15:04.323
What?

15:04.903 --> 15:07.991
Alice, you all right?

15:08.970 --> 15:10.619
Yeah.

15:10.699 --> 15:13.398
Yeah, I was just resting
my eyes and I... um...

15:13.678 --> 15:15.528
...I nodded off.

15:16.904 --> 15:19.996
Why don't you go home? I have this covered.

15:23.604 --> 15:25.428
Thanks, Malcolm.

15:44.038 --> 15:46.529
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:13.141 --> 16:15.129
No, no, they're gonna get me.

16:16.608 --> 16:18.701
They're gonna get me.

16:19.809 --> 16:21.699
Don't want them to get me.

16:37.810 --> 16:39.477
I don't wanna die.

16:59.077 --> 17:01.136
Daddy needs a smoothie.

17:02.780 --> 17:04.800
Daddy needs a smoothie.

17:05.839 --> 17:07.678
Daddy needs...

17:08.079 --> 17:10.137
Daddy needs a smoothie.

17:13.229 --> 17:15.154
Daddy needs a smoothie.

17:18.413 --> 17:20.472
Your Daddy needs a smoothie.

17:32.253 --> 17:34.131
It's you.

17:34.451 --> 17:36.160
Yeah, that's right.

17:36.732 --> 17:38.777
I don't want it to get me.

17:39.442 --> 17:41.288
I don't want it to get me.

17:46.816 --> 17:48.840
I don't want it to come again.

18:02.684 --> 18:04.551
That's right.

18:05.680 --> 18:07.928
Who is Daddy's boy?

18:21.519 --> 18:23.814
I don't want it to come again.

18:24.413 --> 18:26.651
I don't want it to come again.

18:28.152 --> 18:30.177
I don't want it to get me.

18:42.918 --> 18:45.745
- Hey, boo-boo. Hey, boo-boo-boo.
- I hate you.

18:47.587 --> 18:49.444
I hate you!

18:56.221 --> 18:57.731
Mommy...

19:00.762 --> 19:02.623
...help me.

19:10.026 --> 19:11.846
I hate you!

19:15.323 --> 19:16.882
Why?

19:23.955 --> 19:26.214
I don't want it to get me.

19:31.989 --> 19:34.231
What's wrong with my teeth?

19:34.311 --> 19:35.785
I hate you!

19:42.643 --> 19:45.894
- I hate you!
- Emily, wake up! Wake up.

19:47.959 --> 19:49.201
Daniel.

19:50.160 --> 19:51.398
Dad!

20:19.127 --> 20:20.606
Here's your picture, Mom.

20:22.595 --> 20:24.702
So what did you dream about this time?

20:24.781 --> 20:27.484
- Niamh!
- Sorry.

20:27.564 --> 20:31.417
It's okay. It's okay, honey. It's just
an accident. Just grab your school bag.

20:32.696 --> 20:35.321
- You?
- Fine.

20:41.797 --> 20:43.449
Hey.

20:43.529 --> 20:45.149
Hey, what's going on?

20:45.229 --> 20:47.251
I'm just tired.

20:48.779 --> 20:52.222
There was a boy yesterday,
and he reminded me of my brother.

20:54.230 --> 20:58.118
Hey, why don't you go back
to bed for a while, huh?

20:58.198 --> 21:00.326
You probably only slept a couple of hours?

21:43.782 --> 21:46.399
Ready or not, here I come.

22:07.836 --> 22:09.494
Liam?

22:11.770 --> 22:14.661
There you are, next to my sister.

22:17.038 --> 22:19.862
No, Liam, there's no one there. It's just me.

22:24.038 --> 22:25.597
Liam!

22:26.573 --> 22:28.658
Alice! Help me!

22:28.738 --> 22:30.447
Liam!

22:30.527 --> 22:33.163
Alice! Alice!

22:53.853 --> 22:57.681
You two will be sleeping in here with your
parents so you'll feel nice and safe, okay?

23:00.508 --> 23:02.222
What's that?

23:02.302 --> 23:05.235
That is a polysomnogram device.

23:05.315 --> 23:08.795
It helps us figure out why
you're not sleeping properly.

23:09.375 --> 23:12.495
And this monitors your brain waves...

23:12.575 --> 23:16.197
...your eye movements,
your muscle tone and your breathing.

23:16.277 --> 23:18.862
And this right here measures your heart rate.

23:18.942 --> 23:21.433
You look like an alien.

23:24.443 --> 23:27.466
That's stupid. She does not.

23:28.245 --> 23:30.145
Well, not a scary alien, right?

23:40.144 --> 23:41.969
Mr. Morgan.

23:45.878 --> 23:47.768
It helps me sleep.

23:49.578 --> 23:51.665
We had another terrible night last night.

23:52.245 --> 23:55.134
You got no idea how much
we need this to work.

23:55.613 --> 23:58.905
Oh, believe me, I do. Let's get you back in.

24:07.976 --> 24:10.191
There's a night vision camera
in the corner of the room...

24:10.271 --> 24:13.359
...we'll be keeping an eye
on everything you do while you sleep.

24:13.439 --> 24:16.439
So will this stop me
from killing all the teddy bears?

24:20.915 --> 24:24.173
Can't we just never sleep? Please?

24:26.083 --> 24:28.170
I don't want it to come again.

24:29.049 --> 24:32.135
- You don't want what to come again?
- Daniel, we've already talked about this.

24:32.215 --> 24:35.269
We're the only ones in the room, okay?
They're just dreams.

24:35.349 --> 24:37.270
We need to get a good night's sleep.

24:37.350 --> 24:39.640
That's how we're going to get fixed, sweetie.

24:42.350 --> 24:44.408
Will you help me, Dr. Alice?

24:46.617 --> 24:49.640
Of course I will. That's my job.

24:56.251 --> 24:59.276
Everything's gonna be fine.
See you in the morning.

25:00.851 --> 25:02.572
Did you check on Mr. Futterman?

25:02.652 --> 25:05.343
Yes, I did, and he's asleep.

25:46.521 --> 25:50.342
They're definitely shook up.
The father just lost his job.

25:50.422 --> 25:53.559
He seems to be drinking. And his knuckles...

25:53.639 --> 25:57.509
...he says that he's punching
the walls while he's sleep walking...

25:57.589 --> 26:00.510
...which is enough to give anyone nightmares.

26:01.190 --> 26:03.845
Do you remember the, uh, Mitchell case?

26:04.424 --> 26:05.792
It must have been...

26:05.872 --> 26:08.614
...well, at least a decade ago now.

26:09.623 --> 26:12.010
I don't think so. What was his first name?

26:12.090 --> 26:16.031
Dan Mitchell. He was a farmer
over in Winnetka County.

26:16.790 --> 26:19.688
- No.
- Popular guy by all accounts...

26:19.768 --> 26:22.845
...went to church every Sunday.
Not a bad word to be said about him.

26:22.925 --> 26:27.147
Anyway, this guy was a chicken
farmer with a few dozen coops.

26:28.425 --> 26:32.095
His family and friends
knew him as a sleepwalker...

26:32.175 --> 26:33.913
...and a sleep worker.

26:33.993 --> 26:36.950
Every night he used to go out
and do his farm chores while he slept.

26:37.030 --> 26:40.449
Fill the feeders, sweep the floor,
clean out the muck.

26:41.727 --> 26:43.879
Every night like clockwork.

26:43.959 --> 26:45.732
It sounds pretty useful.

26:45.812 --> 26:48.647
Yeah, maybe to begin with.

26:49.426 --> 26:53.495
Turns out, the whole family
had a history of parasomnia.

26:54.594 --> 26:57.863
One night, while he was seeing
to the chickens...

26:57.943 --> 26:59.580
...in his sleep...

26:59.660 --> 27:02.150
...he thought there was
an intruder in his house.

27:03.928 --> 27:08.618
He got into a fight with the attacker
trying to defend his daughter.

27:09.812 --> 27:12.235
By the time they woke him, it was too late.

27:13.763 --> 27:17.184
He'd hacked his wife to death with a shovel.

27:17.264 --> 27:19.715
- That's terrible.
- Yeah.

27:20.095 --> 27:21.976
And he was really asleep when he did it?

27:22.056 --> 27:25.318
Well, he passed all the lie detector tests.

27:25.847 --> 27:27.886
Even his daughter backed up the story.

27:31.080 --> 27:34.119
Daniel said he didn't want 'it'
to come again.

27:34.998 --> 27:37.086
What do you think he meant by that?

27:40.165 --> 27:42.084
Oh, shit, Mr. Futterman's gone.

27:42.164 --> 27:45.652
Well, he's probably gone to
the bathroom. I'll go and check.

27:46.481 --> 27:48.940
Why don't you go and get us some more coffee?

28:24.402 --> 28:26.228
Mr. Futterman?

28:44.069 --> 28:46.722
I fucking told them. I said no!

28:46.802 --> 28:50.060
No! No! No, no.

29:31.706 --> 29:33.249
No.

29:34.729 --> 29:36.978
I... don't.

30:14.978 --> 30:16.850
I don't.

30:18.429 --> 30:20.734
I didn't...

31:04.547 --> 31:06.812
I didn't do anything.

31:17.917 --> 31:20.341
Ready or not, here I come.

31:45.751 --> 31:48.539
Alice, guess where I found Futterman?

31:48.619 --> 31:51.672
He was sleep walking in the shower.
Can you believe it?

32:00.887 --> 32:02.407
Daniel?

32:03.953 --> 32:05.393
Daniel!

32:09.519 --> 32:12.841
- Malcolm?
- Oh, my God.

32:12.921 --> 32:16.804
Daniel, Daniel, just breathe. You're okay.

32:16.884 --> 32:18.775
Take it easy, you're all right.

32:18.855 --> 32:23.340
You'll be okay. Okay, just breathe.
It'll be all right.

32:23.420 --> 32:27.712
That's a good boy. Take it easy. That's it.

32:37.722 --> 32:39.393
I won't let you!

32:40.822 --> 32:43.032
Dad, no! Stop!

32:44.188 --> 32:48.448
- Give him back.
- Dad! Stop!

32:56.023 --> 32:58.315
Alice, are you okay?

33:14.964 --> 33:16.679
<i>I don't think he knew what he was doing.</i>

33:16.759 --> 33:18.914
- <i>Alice.</i>
- <i>I think he was sleep walking.</i>

33:18.993 --> 33:20.493
<i>Alice...</i>

33:21.315 --> 33:24.277
<i>...imagine if it was one of his kids
he grabbed by the throat...</i>

33:24.357 --> 33:26.447
<i>...or hacked up with a shovel.</i>

33:27.426 --> 33:29.881
<i>You saw the bruises on Daniel's chest.</i>

33:29.961 --> 33:33.770
<i>That man might not be consciously
abusive, but he's an alcoholic...</i>

33:33.850 --> 33:36.406
<i>...he's dangerous,
and he shouldn't be around them.</i>

33:38.061 --> 33:40.058
This was the right thing to do.

33:43.627 --> 33:46.747
Alice, you should go home.

33:47.026 --> 33:49.398
Be with your family.

33:49.478 --> 33:52.299
God, forget about this for now.

35:05.301 --> 35:06.857
Oh!

35:07.536 --> 35:09.389
What the hell are you doing?

35:10.368 --> 35:11.879
Niamh!

35:17.702 --> 35:20.873
- You need to stay home and rest.
- I'm fine.

35:20.953 --> 35:22.882
- You're not fine.
- I am.

35:22.962 --> 35:25.723
You do not... fine.
You were saying 'help me'...

35:25.803 --> 35:28.461
...over and over in your sleep last night.

35:29.969 --> 35:31.890
It was just a dream. It's not a big deal.

35:31.970 --> 35:34.857
Alice, you were attacked.
It's a big fucking deal!

35:35.637 --> 35:37.191
Christ...

35:51.673 --> 35:55.497
- Alice, what are you doing here?
- Come here and take a look at this.

36:00.473 --> 36:02.838
Fascinating. They're all in REM sleep...

36:02.918 --> 36:06.506
...but it's like they're synchronized.
Like puppets.

36:06.586 --> 36:09.594
Hm. Yeah, except for Daniel.

36:11.272 --> 36:13.735
They all seem to be moving away from him.

36:15.106 --> 36:18.795
I've never seen such an intense
sleep paralysis episode before.

36:20.173 --> 36:22.031
He looks terrified.

36:27.142 --> 36:28.455
Hey.

36:28.535 --> 36:31.995
Hey, guys, I just wanted to let you know
I don't work for the hospital anymore.

36:32.075 --> 36:34.094
I, uh, handed in my resignation, so...

36:34.174 --> 36:36.469
- What?
- Dr. Arnolds...

36:36.549 --> 36:39.328
...would you mind a word outside?

36:39.408 --> 36:41.240
Of course.

36:45.342 --> 36:48.097
<i>Paging Dr. Davies. Dr. Davies, please.</i>

36:48.177 --> 36:49.930
Cam, are you okay?

36:50.010 --> 36:54.460
Look, stay away from that family.
Never see them again.

36:59.679 --> 37:02.769
Cam. Cam, what are you...

38:09.316 --> 38:12.670
- What's that?
- Oh, nothing, honey.

38:12.749 --> 38:14.637
Boring stuff.

38:15.066 --> 38:16.492
Work stuff.

38:19.184 --> 38:21.505
I'm sorry I yelled at you this morning.

38:21.585 --> 38:23.522
It's okay.

38:31.884 --> 38:34.376
Let's get into your PJ's, Danny.

38:57.204 --> 39:00.038
Did your father do this to you, Daniel?

39:02.387 --> 39:04.279
Then who did?

39:07.687 --> 39:09.565
I told you already...

39:11.713 --> 39:13.953
...it only comes when I'm dreaming.

39:19.221 --> 39:21.110
From the shadows.

42:29.770 --> 42:31.628
Get away from me!

43:30.276 --> 43:32.096
Oh, my God.

43:33.075 --> 43:34.265
Emily.

43:35.115 --> 43:37.971
Wake up. Wake up.

43:38.743 --> 43:41.902
- Mummy, what's going on?
- Close your eyes, sweetie.

43:41.982 --> 43:43.831
Close your eyes.

43:44.161 --> 43:46.002
What's going on?

43:52.911 --> 43:57.714
- Mom, I don't want to stay here.
- Ssh! Don't move, honey.

44:23.431 --> 44:24.904
Daniel!

44:25.595 --> 44:27.093
Daniel!

44:29.648 --> 44:30.972
No!

44:32.948 --> 44:34.041
Daniel!

45:10.017 --> 45:11.571
Honey?

45:12.350 --> 45:13.940
Hey.

45:14.819 --> 45:16.642
I'm having that nightmare again.

45:21.417 --> 45:23.310
Why didn't you tell me?

45:25.753 --> 45:28.244
Because something about this feels different.

45:30.718 --> 45:32.573
I just... I...

45:33.852 --> 45:36.906
I heard that little girl
singing the same lullaby...

45:37.685 --> 45:40.977
...that Liam sung the night
that he died and I just, um...

45:42.319 --> 45:45.370
- I feel like I'm losing my mind.
- Hey.

45:45.850 --> 45:48.742
It's stress, that's all it is, it's stress.

45:49.222 --> 45:50.779
Hm?

45:54.221 --> 45:56.479
I thought about what you said...

45:58.022 --> 45:59.857
...and you're right.

46:00.956 --> 46:03.843
I need to slow down,
and I need to get some sleep.

46:04.522 --> 46:07.922
So I'm gonna go into work
and I'm gonna ask for some time off.

46:11.156 --> 46:12.680
Hallelujah.

46:24.925 --> 46:26.788
Dr. Arnolds.

46:27.349 --> 46:31.477
Please. You know he didn't mean
to attack you. You don't understand.

46:31.557 --> 46:35.245
It isn't Charlie,
it's something else. Something...

46:35.425 --> 46:37.846
...I think it's trying
to pull us apart so it can...

46:37.926 --> 46:39.911
Can what?

46:39.991 --> 46:42.100
I think it's trying to kill my son.

46:43.958 --> 46:46.613
Mrs. Morgan,
no one is trying to kill your son.

46:47.093 --> 46:48.212
Your husband...

46:48.292 --> 46:51.713
My husband was trying to protect us
and you got him locked up!

46:51.793 --> 46:55.485
Last night, Emily butchered our dog
with a pair of garden shears...

46:55.565 --> 46:57.613
...in her sleep, for God sake!

46:58.592 --> 47:03.040
I saw something lift my son's bed
off the ground. I need my husband.

47:03.120 --> 47:07.484
I need my husband back!
You said you would help us!

47:08.661 --> 47:11.487
How could you do this to us?

48:58.938 --> 49:02.762
You know, that night in the ward.
I can't... I can't explain it.

49:05.070 --> 49:07.295
There was something in the room with us.

49:08.570 --> 49:10.435
I had to stop it.

49:11.163 --> 49:13.014
I'm sorry.

49:15.471 --> 49:19.407
You know, people all over the world,
they describe the same dark presence...

49:19.487 --> 49:21.311
...during sleep paralysis episodes.

49:21.391 --> 49:24.158
We write it off as hypnagogic
hallucinations, but...

49:24.238 --> 49:26.202
I knew it wanted Daniel...

49:26.282 --> 49:28.231
...and it sure as shit wasn't no dream.

49:57.875 --> 49:59.766
I hate you!

50:07.508 --> 50:10.532
I hate you. I hate you.

50:18.143 --> 50:19.667
Emily?

50:21.109 --> 50:22.665
Emily?

50:34.562 --> 50:37.526
Oh, no, oh, God.

50:37.606 --> 50:38.782
Sarah.

50:45.178 --> 50:46.949
- It's steak.
- Oh.

50:49.547 --> 50:52.035
Sarah! Sarah, wake up!

50:52.115 --> 50:54.728
Sarah, it's me.

50:56.178 --> 50:58.432
- Help me, please.
- Daniel.

50:59.311 --> 51:01.966
Daniel! Daniel!

51:02.046 --> 51:06.271
Help me! Daniel! Get in here. Daniel! Daniel!

51:10.515 --> 51:12.506
Is he...

51:15.247 --> 51:18.474
- Wake him up! Wake him up!
- Daniel, wake up!

51:38.419 --> 51:42.266
<i>Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream.</i>

51:45.817 --> 51:47.404
Alice?

51:47.484 --> 51:49.074
Hm.

51:51.283 --> 51:52.838
Alice?

51:53.317 --> 51:54.907
Honey?

51:55.751 --> 51:57.339
Alice?

51:57.719 --> 51:59.243
Oh.

52:16.352 --> 52:19.410
I'm sorry. How's Daniel?

52:21.887 --> 52:23.702
He's fine...

52:23.782 --> 52:25.581
...for now.

52:29.220 --> 52:32.459
Look, um, we can't go to the hospital.

52:34.755 --> 52:36.578
What can we do?

52:38.421 --> 52:40.246
I don't know.

53:18.008 --> 53:19.496
He's gotta be here.

53:21.626 --> 53:23.179
Cam?

53:24.108 --> 53:25.967
Cam, it's Alice.

53:27.792 --> 53:30.246
It's Dr. Arnolds from the hospital.

53:36.992 --> 53:38.481
Cam?

53:38.561 --> 53:42.052
Alice. Alice, how did you...

53:44.026 --> 53:46.448
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
Please, you gotta go. Just leave.

53:46.528 --> 53:48.907
My son's life is in danger.

53:49.594 --> 53:51.214
Please.

53:51.294 --> 53:53.549
You're not gonna like what I have to say.

53:55.227 --> 53:58.900
Go back home and distance yourself
from this family. And...

53:58.980 --> 54:03.114
...I'm afraid your son... is gonna die.
There is nothing you can do.

54:03.194 --> 54:05.728
- What, that's it?
- Yes. Now, I'm sorry, you gotta go.

54:05.807 --> 54:08.847
- I'm not going anywhere!
- Leave now!

54:08.927 --> 54:13.150
Cam, don't make me call the cops on you
for stealing tranquilizers from the hospital.

54:16.828 --> 54:19.350
Grandpa? Okay... just a minute.

54:19.430 --> 54:22.184
Hey, just go back to sleep, okay.

54:22.264 --> 54:24.288
No. These guys are just leaving.

54:29.029 --> 54:30.853
It's okay.

54:36.864 --> 54:39.118
My grandfather is fine, Dr. Arnolds.

54:40.796 --> 54:44.654
It's just that those drugs, they're
the only way he can get to sleep.

54:45.533 --> 54:49.085
Your son has always suffered
from sleep talking...

54:49.165 --> 54:52.252
- ...and sleepwalking? Hm?
- Yes.

54:52.332 --> 54:56.768
That's how the wretched thing found him.

54:58.000 --> 55:01.586
It seeks out children who are
neither asleep, nor awake.

55:01.666 --> 55:04.987
For it does not exist in the 'real' world...

55:05.067 --> 55:09.311
...or in the 'dream' world,
but in the cracks in between.

55:09.391 --> 55:11.105
- Well, what is it?
- Grandpa, please.

55:11.185 --> 55:14.594
Ah! It's got many names...

55:14.673 --> 55:17.221
...the Ancient Greek's called it <i>mora</i>...

55:17.321 --> 55:20.589
...the Persian's <i>bakhtak</i>.

55:20.668 --> 55:23.489
The Japanese <i>kannashibari</i>.

55:23.868 --> 55:27.476
I first heard it called <i>nocnitsa.</i>

55:27.556 --> 55:30.689
- In English...
- The Night Hag.

55:30.769 --> 55:32.221
Yeah.

55:32.301 --> 55:35.356
In Olde English, the night-mare.

55:36.035 --> 55:41.535
A demon that has existed
since man first learned to dream.

55:43.316 --> 55:46.323
It doesn't exist, they kept telling me.

55:46.403 --> 55:49.027
Just in your imagination.

55:51.331 --> 55:53.763
Once a child is chosen...

55:57.172 --> 56:01.216
...then it paralyzes
the child in its sleep...

56:01.296 --> 56:03.694
...before crushing it.

56:04.239 --> 56:07.663
And then, when it's finished feasting...

56:11.473 --> 56:12.936
What?

56:20.939 --> 56:23.831
- It happened to me.
- Okay, that's enough, Alice.

56:23.911 --> 56:26.991
- Please, I beg you, just leave him alone.
- How did you survive then?

56:27.940 --> 56:30.228
Another child died in my place.

56:32.006 --> 56:33.870
I don't know how...

56:34.344 --> 56:36.241
...I don't know why.

56:36.321 --> 56:40.798
I've spent my whole life
trying to understand.

56:42.775 --> 56:44.628
But the only thing I've learned...

56:45.108 --> 56:47.136
...is that there are no answers.

56:49.142 --> 56:51.434
There is no help for your son.

56:54.276 --> 56:57.929
Charlie, look at me.
Nothing is going to happen to Daniel.

56:58.009 --> 57:01.454
We're gonna do everything we can. We'll
keep him awake. Whatever we have to do.

57:02.293 --> 57:04.363
There are always answers.

57:04.443 --> 57:06.338
I like you.

57:07.192 --> 57:09.363
I, too, was once fierce.

57:10.478 --> 57:12.953
Then I got old.

57:13.433 --> 57:15.339
Life's a bitch.

57:16.844 --> 57:19.269
Life's a b...

57:19.977 --> 57:21.566
Hello.

58:01.415 --> 58:04.306
- Are the salts working?
- So far, but he's fading.

58:09.614 --> 58:11.903
We should not be here, Grandpa.

58:11.983 --> 58:14.207
- Hello.
- Hi.

58:18.949 --> 58:22.375
Okay, the oxygen should keep him
awake for a little while.

58:24.350 --> 58:27.703
By now, the thing
that is attacking your son...

58:27.783 --> 58:30.470
...doesn't care whether it's day or night.

58:31.649 --> 58:33.538
It knows he's weak.

58:34.218 --> 58:37.876
And when he sleeps, it will come.

58:42.151 --> 58:46.539
We will find a solution, but until we do, we
all need to stay by him and keep him awake.

58:46.619 --> 58:49.139
Be strong for your son. You can do that.

58:49.219 --> 58:51.142
Thank you, Alice.

59:38.723 --> 59:40.952
I used to sleepwalk a lot...

59:41.749 --> 59:43.630
...when I was boy, too.

59:45.090 --> 59:47.727
It was while I was asleep...

59:48.906 --> 59:50.705
...that I first saw it.

59:51.023 --> 59:54.512
A kind old woman who would sing that lullaby.

59:55.641 --> 59:59.262
Come, she said, let's play a game.

01:00:00.490 --> 01:00:03.381
That's how it got close to me.

01:00:04.324 --> 01:00:06.735
But then it all changed
when I first saw it for what it really was.

01:00:06.815 --> 01:00:10.105
- Grandpa, stop it.
- Tell me, tell me...

01:00:10.185 --> 01:00:12.978
...have you all been sleepwalking?

01:00:13.058 --> 01:00:14.546
Nightmares?

01:00:14.626 --> 01:00:16.516
The horse.

01:00:19.358 --> 01:00:22.412
The horse with the white eyes. I hate it.

01:00:23.092 --> 01:00:27.650
Nightmares, sleepwalking,
the same thing happened to my family.

01:00:27.730 --> 01:00:31.213
I believe this parasite infects your dreams.

01:00:32.192 --> 01:00:35.147
It knew my family's darkest fears...

01:00:35.227 --> 01:00:40.147
...and used their nightmares
to distract them away from me...

01:00:40.227 --> 01:00:43.085
...allowing it to feed on me, undisturbed.

01:00:45.562 --> 01:00:47.514
Except for my sister.

01:00:47.594 --> 01:00:50.483
She was somehow able to save me from it.

01:00:51.762 --> 01:00:55.034
Then she paid with her own life.

01:01:01.231 --> 01:01:03.316
Daniel, wake up!

01:01:03.396 --> 01:01:05.050
- Get him to the bathroom!
- Dan, wake up!

01:01:05.130 --> 01:01:07.816
You can wake him in the bathroom
in the cold water, come on!

01:01:16.131 --> 01:01:19.523
Talk to me. Talk to me. Tell me your
name. Charlie, get my medical bag.

01:01:19.603 --> 01:01:21.765
- I'm not leaving him.
- Charlie, now!

01:01:21.845 --> 01:01:24.832
- Say something! We can't keep him like this!
- I know. This will keep you up.

01:01:24.912 --> 01:01:27.972
Talk to me, Daniel! Please, Daniel!

01:01:32.565 --> 01:01:34.440
Get him up!

01:01:35.799 --> 01:01:37.647
Do something!

01:01:45.101 --> 01:01:47.719
- Oh, my God.
- Here we go.

01:01:50.596 --> 01:01:52.856
Okay. Okay.

01:01:54.168 --> 01:01:55.992
I'm sorry.

01:02:02.568 --> 01:02:05.387
How long will the adrenaline
keep him awake for?

01:02:05.967 --> 01:02:08.226
I'm not sure, maybe a couple hours.

01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:13.559
Can we give him more if we need to?

01:02:17.002 --> 01:02:18.859
His pulse is too high.

01:02:29.669 --> 01:02:33.444
- <i>Tom?</i>
- Mom, where are you? I miss you.

01:02:34.004 --> 01:02:37.125
Oh, honey, I'm just...
I'm busy helping someone.

01:02:37.205 --> 01:02:38.591
<i>Is Daddy there?</i>

01:02:38.671 --> 01:02:42.357
Daddy's in the lounge, talking to Malcolm.

01:02:42.937 --> 01:02:45.942
<i>I heard them say you're trying
to save your brother.</i>

01:02:46.321 --> 01:02:48.591
<i>I thought your brother was dead?</i>

01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:52.958
Just tell Daddy that, um,
that everything's fine, okay?

01:02:53.038 --> 01:02:55.859
- <i>Okay, Mom, but please come home soon.</i>
- Okay.

01:02:55.939 --> 01:02:58.796
<i>I didn't sleep very well
last night without you here.</i>

01:03:00.872 --> 01:03:05.225
- I'll be home very soon, I promise.
- Okay. Bye. I love you.

01:03:05.305 --> 01:03:07.163
<i>I love you, too.</i>

01:03:23.407 --> 01:03:28.229
Sweet red chili flavor.

01:03:29.508 --> 01:03:31.162
They're good.

01:03:31.241 --> 01:03:32.854
I'm okay.

01:03:34.444 --> 01:03:36.570
I understand...

01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:38.863
...that you want to help...

01:03:38.943 --> 01:03:41.097
...but you should go home to your family.

01:03:41.176 --> 01:03:43.198
There's nothing more for you to do.

01:03:43.908 --> 01:03:46.964
Do not lose sight of what's important.

01:03:47.543 --> 01:03:51.197
- Saving that boy is important.
- Saving him is impossible.

01:03:51.277 --> 01:03:54.031
What you can do is save yourself.

01:03:54.111 --> 01:03:56.235
Don't make the same mistake as me.

01:03:58.176 --> 01:04:00.464
It drove me to obsession.

01:04:01.293 --> 01:04:03.339
I was so scared...

01:04:04.172 --> 01:04:05.948
...I couldn't sleep for years.

01:04:06.810 --> 01:04:10.498
It's crazy what a person
will do to stay awake.

01:04:11.377 --> 01:04:14.000
I tried to cut my eyelids off.

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:15.970
Oh, God.

01:04:18.445 --> 01:04:20.905
Come on, Grandpa, we should go.

01:04:23.047 --> 01:04:27.900
You know, I really thought
that you might find an answer.

01:04:28.579 --> 01:04:30.926
When you're fixated on something...

01:04:31.145 --> 01:04:33.835
...it's as if you're sleepwalking.

01:04:34.514 --> 01:04:36.335
Time to wake up.

01:04:37.015 --> 01:04:38.597
Amado...

01:04:40.246 --> 01:04:43.905
...do you think that your sister
was sleepwalking when she saved you?

01:04:59.249 --> 01:05:01.569
Hey, energy drink.

01:05:01.649 --> 01:05:03.506
Hey, psst.

01:05:05.115 --> 01:05:07.007
You drink this.

01:05:12.550 --> 01:05:14.441
One more.

01:05:15.734 --> 01:05:17.758
Hey, good boy.

01:05:28.551 --> 01:05:31.438
Hey, you remember Christmas
a couple of years back?

01:05:32.117 --> 01:05:33.939
Grandma's house?

01:05:34.218 --> 01:05:36.639
It snowed hard all Christmas Eve.

01:05:37.418 --> 01:05:40.873
You were so excited about all
your presents, you couldn't sleep.

01:05:42.351 --> 01:05:44.211
You came to sleep with Mom and me.

01:05:46.821 --> 01:05:49.840
You just sat there all night,
at the end of the bed.

01:05:50.819 --> 01:05:54.644
Your eyes wide open.

01:05:56.588 --> 01:05:58.345
Remember?

01:05:59.638 --> 01:06:01.462
Do you remember that?

01:06:06.854 --> 01:06:11.141
So we know this thing pushes us away
from Daniel when it's feeding, right?

01:06:12.570 --> 01:06:15.826
So what if we could get back
to Daniel to protect him?

01:06:16.455 --> 01:06:18.709
We've been with him before, we can't stop it.

01:06:18.789 --> 01:06:21.108
Yes, but we were awake.

01:06:21.188 --> 01:06:25.280
What if we could protect Daniel
while we're asleep?

01:06:27.456 --> 01:06:30.109
I know, just follow me.

01:06:30.589 --> 01:06:32.824
My brother saw "it" when he was sleepwalking.

01:06:32.904 --> 01:06:35.777
You, Charlie, saw something at the
hospital when you were sleepwalking.

01:06:35.857 --> 01:06:40.877
Amado's sister not only saw it, but she
could stop it while she was sleepwalking.

01:06:40.957 --> 01:06:42.811
My sister died.

01:06:43.390 --> 01:06:46.941
We're not children, and there's more
than one of us so maybe if we can see it...

01:06:47.020 --> 01:06:50.068
- ...we can stop it.
- Fucking nuts!

01:06:51.258 --> 01:06:55.748
You're asking me to protect
my son when I'm asleep.

01:06:56.893 --> 01:06:58.914
Charlie, we have to do something.

01:06:59.793 --> 01:07:04.074
Daniel is exhausted and I cannot give him
any more medication. He'll be asleep soon.

01:07:04.154 --> 01:07:07.213
And there's nothing we can do
to stop it, this is our only shot.

01:07:08.092 --> 01:07:10.479
We'll know what to expect this time.

01:07:10.559 --> 01:07:12.979
We won't let it push us away.

01:07:13.059 --> 01:07:14.914
All right.

01:07:15.693 --> 01:07:17.950
But how am I going to get to sleep?

01:07:22.993 --> 01:07:24.851
It's heavy stuff.

01:07:30.194 --> 01:07:32.036
It's just for tonight.

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:34.377
So...

01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:36.955
...who's driving, you or me?

01:07:39.195 --> 01:07:40.720
Okay.

01:07:53.063 --> 01:07:56.863
It's okay, she's safe now.

01:08:41.966 --> 01:08:44.455
It's done, Sarah. Give me your arm, Charlie.

01:08:45.634 --> 01:08:49.589
The demon will use
our nightmares against us...

01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:52.520
...to draw us away from him.

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:56.090
Do not believe your surroundings.

01:08:57.069 --> 01:08:59.487
Return to this room.

01:09:00.903 --> 01:09:03.163
Return to Daniel.

01:09:15.870 --> 01:09:17.877
If I fall asleep...

01:09:18.685 --> 01:09:21.555
- ...will I die?
- No, honey.

01:09:21.636 --> 01:09:24.390
I know you're scared. I am, too...

01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:28.059
...but we're going to get through this
together, all right? Let me test you.

01:09:28.139 --> 01:09:32.229
This will keep you awake, okay?
What's... what's... what's three times five?

01:09:33.372 --> 01:09:36.546
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen, good.

01:09:36.626 --> 01:09:38.425
And, um...

01:09:39.323 --> 01:09:41.282
...what's four times five?

01:09:43.004 --> 01:09:45.094
Twe... twenty.

01:09:45.774 --> 01:09:48.594
All right, stay with me, honey.
What's six times eight?

01:09:49.273 --> 01:09:50.975
Six times...

01:10:01.608 --> 01:10:02.981
Daniel?

01:10:03.061 --> 01:10:05.285
Daniel? Daniel?

01:10:10.941 --> 01:10:13.362
Amado, are you awake?

01:10:14.541 --> 01:10:16.548
Nothing's happening to me.

01:10:18.041 --> 01:10:20.096
Why is no one sleepwalking?

01:10:20.875 --> 01:10:22.400
Daniel?

01:10:27.809 --> 01:10:29.362
Daniel?

01:10:39.576 --> 01:10:41.101
Daniel?

01:10:52.478 --> 01:10:54.030
Daniel?

01:11:01.879 --> 01:11:03.471
Daniel?

01:11:13.413 --> 01:11:15.003
Peter.

01:11:17.213 --> 01:11:19.022
Hey, Peter.

01:11:20.730 --> 01:11:22.270
Hello.

01:11:23.779 --> 01:11:26.473
Hey. Come here.

01:11:29.180 --> 01:11:30.704
Hello.

01:11:36.616 --> 01:11:39.473
Why would you say that about my teeth? I...

01:12:07.785 --> 01:12:11.143
- It's not real.
- Help me, Alice, please!

01:12:13.318 --> 01:12:16.893
- I can't help you.
- You can, Alice. Please!

01:12:26.752 --> 01:12:28.573
Remember where you are!

01:12:29.252 --> 01:12:30.578
Come back!

01:12:32.441 --> 01:12:34.478
Come back to Daniel!

01:12:37.053 --> 01:12:38.611
Daniel.

01:12:46.154 --> 01:12:49.441
- Help me, Alice! Please!
- I can't help you. You're not my brother.

01:12:49.521 --> 01:12:52.208
- Alice! Help!
- No, my brother's dead.

01:12:52.288 --> 01:12:54.141
It's Daniel...

01:13:12.756 --> 01:13:14.278
Peter.

01:13:14.957 --> 01:13:17.099
Oh, no, no!

01:13:17.482 --> 01:13:19.025
Peter!

01:13:19.792 --> 01:13:21.504
Peter!

01:13:34.425 --> 01:13:35.783
Please!

01:13:41.757 --> 01:13:43.973
- Liam!
- Alice, help me!

01:13:44.053 --> 01:13:46.024
- Alice!
- Liam!

01:13:53.893 --> 01:13:55.419
Peter!

01:13:57.160 --> 01:13:59.848
Liam! No!

01:14:00.328 --> 01:14:02.218
Please, Alice!

01:14:05.727 --> 01:14:09.932
Finish what you started!

01:14:10.012 --> 01:14:12.332
- Alice!
- Liam!

01:14:22.793 --> 01:14:24.654
Oh, I've got you.

01:14:30.062 --> 01:14:31.953
I've got you.

01:14:56.333 --> 01:14:59.357
My brother is dead!

01:15:20.567 --> 01:15:22.092
Amado?

01:15:27.067 --> 01:15:28.591
Amado?

01:15:29.967 --> 01:15:31.554
Amado?

01:15:58.270 --> 01:15:59.794
Amado?

01:16:09.471 --> 01:16:13.529
Finish what I started.

01:16:58.607 --> 01:17:00.466
I'm sorry.

01:17:01.741 --> 01:17:03.966
You did the right thing.

01:17:06.942 --> 01:17:08.485
Finally...

01:17:09.296 --> 01:17:13.361
...I can get some real sleep.

01:19:17.386 --> 01:19:19.307
- Hello.
- <i>Mom?</i>

01:19:19.387 --> 01:19:22.008
Hi! How are you, my little artist?

01:19:22.088 --> 01:19:25.439
<i>I'm retired now. Wanna play?</i>

01:19:25.519 --> 01:19:27.093
Yes.

01:19:27.173 --> 01:19:29.371
One, two, three.

01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:33.595
- <i>No, that's not fair! You cheated.</i>
- I won! I did not cheat!

01:19:33.675 --> 01:19:35.618
- Who's the loser now?
- <i>Best out of three.</i>

01:19:35.698 --> 01:19:36.775
Okay.

01:19:36.855 --> 01:19:40.507
<i>Okay, sweetie, that's enough. Look,
um, Mom and Dad need to talk now, okay?</i>

01:19:40.587 --> 01:19:43.876
- <i>One minute only. One minute.</i>
- <i>Okay, okay. Okay.</i>

01:19:43.956 --> 01:19:46.646
- I love you.
- <i>Love you, too.</i>

01:19:49.056 --> 01:19:52.443
- <i>Hey.</i>
- How is she?

01:19:52.523 --> 01:19:55.410
<i>Apart from her hamster dying last night...</i>

01:19:55.490 --> 01:19:58.309
<i>...she's, um, she's fine.</i>

01:19:58.389 --> 01:20:00.409
Oh, that's awful.

01:20:00.489 --> 01:20:04.110
- <i>How are you?</i>
- I'm really good, actually.

01:20:04.189 --> 01:20:08.243
Rested. Feeling better...
better than I've been in years.

01:20:08.323 --> 01:20:10.877
<i>I don't think that either of us have, uh...</i>

01:20:10.957 --> 01:20:13.012
<i>...slept well since this
whole thing happened.</i>

01:20:13.092 --> 01:20:14.575
I know.

01:20:14.655 --> 01:20:16.155
Tom...

01:20:17.023 --> 01:20:19.846
...this has been so rough
on the two of you and I'm so sorry.

01:20:19.926 --> 01:20:22.345
All my priorities were messed up.

01:20:22.425 --> 01:20:25.146
<i>Yeah, I know, it's, um, it's okay.</i>

01:20:25.225 --> 01:20:28.012
I promise from now on,
you two are my first priority.

01:20:28.092 --> 01:20:30.842
No more obsessing over work.

01:20:35.018 --> 01:20:37.079
- No.
- <i>Alice?</i>

01:20:37.758 --> 01:20:39.313
- <i>What's wrong, honey?</i>
- No.

01:20:39.393 --> 01:20:43.146
- Tom, that lullaby, where did she hear that?
- <i>Honey, calm down. We're okay.</i>

01:20:43.226 --> 01:20:45.647
- Where did she hear it?
- <i>What are you talking about?</i>

01:20:45.727 --> 01:20:48.014
- <i>What are you... look, please, just...</i>
- Where did she hear it?

01:20:48.094 --> 01:20:50.314
- <i>...calm down!</i>
- Alice?

01:20:50.394 --> 01:20:55.000
- <i>We're fine. Everything is fine.</i>
- No, it's not okay! Please listen to me.

01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:59.399
- <i>Calm down! You're upsetting Niamh!</i>
- I wanna talk to my husband! Tom?

01:20:59.479 --> 01:21:01.482
<i>I can't do this anymore!</i>

01:21:01.962 --> 01:21:05.404
Stop it! Tom! Tom!

01:21:05.984 --> 01:21:07.550
Tom!
