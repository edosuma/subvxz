00:02.149 --> 00:04.582
E. R.

00:04.783 --> 00:06.296
Previously on E. R.

00:06.397 --> 00:09.334
It's an isolated dysfunction
of the right hypoglossal nerve.

00:09.435 --> 00:11.007
It's a recurrence.

00:13.774 --> 00:16.721
- Nothing I can do can make it right.
- You can leave.

00:17.684 --> 00:20.296
You can pack up your things
and leave my house.

00:20.397 --> 00:24.270
Either she's out of the house
or I'm not taking that baby home.

00:25.861 --> 00:27.709
Brian. Brian!

00:29.299 --> 00:32.054
I won't mess with Abby again.
I won't even talk to her.

00:32.155 --> 00:33.768
You touch her again...

00:34.069 --> 00:35.815
...I'll kill you.

00:36.292 --> 00:39.039

00:50.405 --> 00:54.564
Dr. Hirsch, please pick up
extension 350.

00:54.738 --> 00:57.770
Dr. Hirsch, extension 350.

01:12.067 --> 01:13.939
I apologize for how late he's running.

01:14.982 --> 01:18.430
- It's okay.
- I'm sure he'll be with you any moment.

01:18.607 --> 01:20.313
I can wait.

01:20.482 --> 01:23.479
I'll see you in two weeks.

01:24.480 --> 01:28.853
Judy will give you all your pre-op
instructions before you leave.

01:29.938 --> 01:32.603
- Thank you.
- You've come to the right place, Mary.

01:33.479 --> 01:36.145
- Mark, you look good.
- You too.

01:36.312 --> 01:38.136
- How was your flight?
- Uneventful.

01:38.311 --> 01:40.384
Yeah, the best kind.

01:40.560 --> 01:42.017
Elizabeth with you?

01:42.185 --> 01:44.057
Not this time.

01:44.643 --> 01:48.683
See this area?
It's called "ring enhancement."

01:48.851 --> 01:52.013
It encircles the cavity
where we removed your tumor.

01:52.183 --> 01:54.303
Could it be inflammation
from a vaccine?

01:54.474 --> 01:55.883
No.

01:56.640 --> 01:58.595
What about a side effect
from radiation?

01:58.806 --> 02:01.969
The spec MRl shows a peak
of creatine and choline...

02:02.139 --> 02:06.131
...with a depressed NAA,
which rules out radiation necrosis.

02:06.430 --> 02:09.131
I'm afraid
it's definitely tumor re-growth.

02:11.470 --> 02:12.963
Don't you need a biopsy?

02:13.595 --> 02:15.501
Spectroscopy was conclusive.

02:20.802 --> 02:22.424
How soon can you operate?

02:26.383 --> 02:28.290
I can't.

02:29.924 --> 02:31.464
Not this time.

02:31.632 --> 02:33.623
The tumor invaded the areas of the brain...

02:33.715 --> 02:35.373
that control speech and motor function.

02:35.548 --> 02:39.292
If I start digging around in there now,
the side effects would be devastating.

02:39.464 --> 02:42.461
You wouldn't be able
to walk, talk, feed yourself.

02:42.629 --> 02:45.248
Which is exactly what'll happen
as the tumor grows.

02:47.004 --> 02:50.617
Some of the cells must've been
radiation-resistant.

02:54.586 --> 02:58.660
So what are my options? I mean, other
than sticking a shotgun in my mouth.

02:59.751 --> 03:03.162
Your best bet now
is stereotactic radiosurgery.

03:03.959 --> 03:07.654
The Gamma Knife's safe and effective.
And they can do it in Chicago.

03:08.624 --> 03:09.902
And if it works?

03:10.332 --> 03:13.993
- The average is four, maybe five-
- Years?

03:14.164 --> 03:15.822
Months.

03:19.121 --> 03:21.788
So I'm back where I started.

03:22.620 --> 03:25.322
You should've been dead
a year ago, Mark.

03:25.745 --> 03:29.406
You got married,
saw your daughter be born.

03:30.036 --> 03:31.841
I'd say that was time well-spent.

04:43.614 --> 04:45.191
Dad?

04:46.324 --> 04:49.527
Dad, don't you have work today?

04:51.244 --> 04:52.868
I'm up.

04:53.370 --> 04:56.121
- I made you some coffee.
- Thanks.

04:56.289 --> 04:58.162
You want some breakfast?

04:58.540 --> 05:00.746
No. I'm good, thanks.

05:01.125 --> 05:02.952
I'll be down in a minute.

05:18.970 --> 05:22.172
- Elizabeth called. You were showering.
- Should've come and got me.

05:22.347 --> 05:24.504
- Did she leave a number?
- No.

05:24.682 --> 05:26.306
How am I supposed to call her back?

05:26.474 --> 05:30.174
She wanted you to bring some things
for Ella to work. I wrote them down.

05:32.395 --> 05:34.517
I can get all that stuff
and put it in a bag.

05:34.688 --> 05:37.308
- No, no, no. I'll do it.
- I don't mind.

05:38.399 --> 05:40.889
- How'd it go?
- What?

05:41.525 --> 05:42.936
The conference in New York.

05:43.360 --> 05:46.858
Oh, good. You know, the usual.

05:47.029 --> 05:48.653
Boring.

05:49.197 --> 05:52.482
So everything's set
for staying tonight at Kelly's?

05:53.075 --> 05:54.616
Yeah.

05:55.785 --> 05:58.026
Are you sure
you should be doing this?

05:58.203 --> 06:00.871
- This?
- Working a double shift?

06:01.038 --> 06:04.203
- You seem a little tired from your trip.
- I'll be fine.

06:04.373 --> 06:06.780
Iverson in 4 needs
about another hour of monitoring.

06:06.958 --> 06:09.662
Dunn, also in 4, is probably
gonna need a walking cast.

06:09.835 --> 06:11.210
The foot x-rays are pending.

06:11.378 --> 06:13.334
Dr. Lewis is crashed out in 3.

06:13.504 --> 06:14.879
- Susan?
- Yeah.

06:15.047 --> 06:17.417
She... She worked a double,
so don't wake her up.

06:17.590 --> 06:21.752
And last but not least is the lovely but
kind of spooky Miss Armstrong in 2...

06:21.926 --> 06:25.507
...who's waiting on a Psych consult
before the sewer people come get her.

06:25.679 --> 06:28.880
- What sewer people?
- She's crazy. Hence, the Psych consult.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.462
And there's a bad burn trauma
coming in, so have fun.

06:31.640 --> 06:33.182
- Right.
- He called again.

06:33.350 --> 06:36.266
- Randall?
- Five calls in 18 hours.

06:36.434 --> 06:37.715
Sounds like a stalker.

06:37.895 --> 06:40.645
- You want me to talk to him?
- No. Thanks.

06:40.813 --> 06:42.935
- What are you looking at?
- Theresa Matthews.

06:43.105 --> 06:46.224
Comatose for a year following an MVA.
Mom takes care of her at home.

06:46.399 --> 06:48.724
Called 911, thought her daughter
was in discomfort.

06:48.901 --> 06:50.643
- How could she tell?
- My question too.

06:50.819 --> 06:53.373
Dr. Kovac wants you to meet him in the
ambulance bay...

06:53.408 --> 06:54.812
with Tartaglia's x-rays.

06:54.988 --> 06:56.862
- Really?
- He said it was an emergency.

06:57.031 --> 06:59.569
- Tartaglia from last night?
- The one with the whiplash.

06:59.741 --> 07:00.856
Just telling you what he said.

07:00.951 --> 07:02.741
More information might've helped.

07:02.910 --> 07:06.158
- Am I talking to you?
- Knock it off and help me find it.

07:16.334 --> 07:18.373
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

07:18.836 --> 07:20.627
Who's your friend?

07:22.631 --> 07:24.706
Would you mind telling me
what's going on?

07:24.882 --> 07:26.375
He was gonna give me a ticket.

07:26.549 --> 07:30.167
- Excuse me?
- I told him I had an emergency.

07:30.344 --> 07:32.668
Oh, so you used me
to get out of a ticket.

07:32.845 --> 07:34.304
It would have been a big ticket.

07:34.471 --> 07:36.628
I'm glad you could pull me away
from patients...

07:36.806 --> 07:39.343
...so you could avoid traffic school.

07:41.684 --> 07:43.391
I owe you one.

07:44.644 --> 07:48.889
Nice car.
Did he get the leopard-print interior?

07:49.439 --> 07:51.846
- You off?
- Not till 10.

07:52.024 --> 07:55.605
- What did you do to deserve that?
- I asked.

07:56.569 --> 07:59.438
This way, I'm never home
when my neighbor is.

07:59.612 --> 08:01.520
He's out on bail?

08:01.696 --> 08:03.605
Till the trial.

08:03.781 --> 08:05.654
Then I get my life back.

08:05.824 --> 08:08.149
- How's his wife?
- She's good.

08:08.326 --> 08:09.570
Safe.

08:10.744 --> 08:12.321
How are you?

08:12.495 --> 08:13.739
How's the eye?

08:13.912 --> 08:16.403
Good. I think my Good Samaritan
days are over, though.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.073
You probably saved her life.

08:20.292 --> 08:23.624
Steady midnights, that can be tough.
You getting enough sleep?

08:23.794 --> 08:25.038
Yeah? Eating okay?

08:26.670 --> 08:29.624
- Feeling depressed or anxious?
- I have to get back.

08:29.798 --> 08:32.121
- Call if you want to talk.
- I'm good.

08:32.299 --> 08:35.133
Coffee and pie on me
if you change your mind.

08:39.470 --> 08:41.178
Hey.

08:41.347 --> 08:45.295
What does a girl have to do
to get a cup of coffee around here?

08:45.474 --> 08:47.216
- Mark?
- Hey.

08:47.392 --> 08:49.965
I just worked two shifts.
I'm supposed to be the zombie.

08:50.144 --> 08:53.428
- Little slow getting started this morning.
- How was New York?

08:53.604 --> 08:56.972
Well, I didn't see as many
Broadway plays as I'd hoped.

08:57.148 --> 08:58.606
And my tumor's back.

08:58.774 --> 09:01.478
Oh, God, Mark, I'm sorry.

09:01.651 --> 09:03.310
I do Gamma Knife today.

09:03.485 --> 09:06.604
- Today? What are you doing here?
- It's best to stay busy.

09:06.779 --> 09:10.111
- How's Elizabeth taking it?
- I haven't told her yet.

09:10.282 --> 09:13.198
What? Why not? Mark, you shouldn't
be going through this alone.

09:13.366 --> 09:14.646
I'll see her this afternoon.

09:14.825 --> 09:16.450
- What time's your treatment?
30.

09:16.619 --> 09:19.452
I'm gonna go home and get some rest.
But after, I'll come by-

09:19.620 --> 09:21.030
- You don't have to.
- I want to.

09:21.205 --> 09:22.995
Dr. Greene,
Dr. Weaver needs some help.

09:23.165 --> 09:26.034
All right, I'll let you go.
Bye. Good luck.

09:26.208 --> 09:28.911
- What patient?
- She's got an elderly woman in CHF.

09:29.084 --> 09:30.827
An explosion trauma just rolled in...

09:31.002 --> 09:34.038
...and there's an MVA with a possible
spinal injury 10 minutes out.

09:34.213 --> 09:36.537
- They need you in Trauma 2. Burn victim.
- Okay.

09:36.715 --> 09:38.706
- I'm firing that new guy.
- What new guy?

09:38.883 --> 09:40.127
Jerry.

09:40.300 --> 09:41.841
Jerry was here before you, Frank.

09:42.009 --> 09:44.582
So was the Neanderthal man,
but he didn't last either.

09:44.761 --> 09:47.595
- You can't fire anybody.
- Either he goes or I go.

09:47.763 --> 09:49.920
You- You!
You'll be hearing from my lawyer.

09:50.097 --> 09:52.255
- What'd I do?
- Mark, coffee.

09:53.017 --> 09:56.467
- Mr. Nevinger, did you pass out?
- No.

09:56.643 --> 10:00.342
Full trauma panel, portable C-spine,
chest and pelvis.

10:00.521 --> 10:03.190
Start a second IV with LR.

10:03.356 --> 10:07.731
Add an ABG
with carboxyhemoglobin and a CK.

10:07.901 --> 10:10.735
Sats, 94. Pulse, 120.
Can I give him something for pain?

10:10.902 --> 10:14.352
Titrate 10 of morphine. But watch
his pressure. Keep him above 90.

10:14.529 --> 10:16.604
Carbonaceous materials
on his nose and lips.

10:16.781 --> 10:18.323
He's not moving much air.

10:18.741 --> 10:20.613
He's in too much pain to breathe.

10:20.826 --> 10:23.777
- How much fluid?
- One liter per hour for the first 8 hours.

10:23.952 --> 10:26.988
I'll ask my super. I think there's
a waiting list for my building.

10:27.163 --> 10:29.700
There's been an old lady
who's been sick on my floor.

10:29.873 --> 10:32.623
I don't want to live in an apartment
where somebody died.

10:32.791 --> 10:36.040
All you need is some Lysol
and some air freshener, and it's all good.

10:36.210 --> 10:37.787
- Are you moving?
- Yeah.

10:37.961 --> 10:39.953
The freak who hit me moved back in.

10:41.380 --> 10:44.000
You can stay at my place
till you find something else.

10:44.173 --> 10:46.461
Thanks. I don't know
if that's a good idea.

10:47.008 --> 10:49.925
- Why not?
- Yeah, Abby. Why not?

10:50.761 --> 10:53.048
Don't you guys have something to do?

10:54.554 --> 10:57.389
You shouldn't have to leave
your own place. He should move.

10:57.557 --> 10:58.801
He'll be in jail soon.

10:58.974 --> 11:02.140
I just don't know if I want
to live there after all this.

11:02.518 --> 11:04.309
- What's with the car?
- Like it?

11:04.477 --> 11:06.434
- It's kind of flashy.
- You only live once.

11:06.604 --> 11:10.018
Well, not if you keep driving
like a maniac.

11:10.565 --> 11:12.805
- You look kind of tired.
- Yeah. I was up late.

11:12.983 --> 11:14.560
Oh, really? What's her name?

11:14.734 --> 11:17.484
- Who?
- It's a joke, Luka.

11:17.652 --> 11:19.977
- No, seriously. If you need a place...
- Thank you.

11:20.154 --> 11:23.568
Stay as long as you need. You only
have to sleep with me on the weekends.

11:23.739 --> 11:26.443
- Excuse me?
- It's a joke, Abby. It's a joke.

11:26.617 --> 11:28.692
Who called for a consult?

11:28.868 --> 11:30.361
Burn patient. Trauma 2.

11:30.535 --> 11:32.575
- What doctor?
- Greene.

11:32.912 --> 11:35.746
- Make it stop hurting.
- We're trying, Ian.

11:36.081 --> 11:38.915
- How's his PO-2?
- Eighty-nine on 10 liters.

11:39.082 --> 11:41.121
- Borderline.
- I don't want to tube him yet.

11:41.292 --> 11:43.414
Why not? He's hypoxic.
He needs intubation.

11:43.586 --> 11:45.376
Then I can assess him
for escharotomy.

11:45.545 --> 11:47.537
Dr. Greene, his wife's here.

11:47.713 --> 11:49.123
That's why I've been waiting.

11:49.297 --> 11:50.838
Keep an eye on him.

11:54.717 --> 11:57.717
- Mrs. Nevinger, I'm Dr. Greene.
- Can I see him?

11:57.886 --> 12:00.008
- The surgeon's in with him now.
- The surgeon?

12:00.179 --> 12:03.760
The burns caused constrictive
tissue-swelling around his chest.

12:03.932 --> 12:07.429
He may need a procedure
to relieve that so he can breathe easier.

12:07.600 --> 12:10.802
- You have to do an escharotomy?
- Maybe.

12:10.977 --> 12:14.595
- You in the medical profession?
- Yeah. I'm a nurse at Mercy.

12:14.772 --> 12:16.847
- Is he intubated?
- Not yet.

12:17.023 --> 12:19.062
What's the surface area?

12:19.232 --> 12:21.391
Over 50 percent.

12:21.568 --> 12:23.274
Oh, God.

12:23.444 --> 12:25.731
Do you know how it happened?

12:26.112 --> 12:30.022
He was in the garage painting some
new furniture for our son's bedroom.

12:30.281 --> 12:32.189
Did he have a heater on in the garage?

12:32.366 --> 12:35.781
No. He paints cars. He knows
he has to be careful around that stuff.

12:35.951 --> 12:38.406
Well, we're gonna do
everything we can. Okay?

12:39.996 --> 12:41.987
Repeat the blood gas in 20 minutes...

12:42.080 --> 12:44.617
and have a fiber-optic scope standing by.

12:44.790 --> 12:46.617
Elizabeth.

12:46.791 --> 12:50.241
- How is he?
- In need of intubation.

12:50.628 --> 12:52.785
I brought the things
you asked me to bring.

12:52.962 --> 12:54.753
Thank you.

12:54.922 --> 12:56.665
What are we doing?

12:57.798 --> 13:00.335
I miss you and Ella.
I need you to come home.

13:00.508 --> 13:02.216
I can't.

13:02.385 --> 13:04.258
You have every right
to be angry with me.

13:04.427 --> 13:06.751
But staying in a hotel
isn't gonna solve anything.

13:06.929 --> 13:08.968
Mark, I'm not trying to punish you.

13:09.139 --> 13:11.296
I'm just trying to do
what's best for Ella.

13:11.473 --> 13:14.758
Don't you think it's best for her
to be with her mother and father?

13:14.935 --> 13:17.092
- Yes, I do.
- So when are you coming home?

13:17.269 --> 13:19.057
I don't know.

13:23.456 --> 13:25.283
Aaron, how many lights do you see?

13:25.458 --> 13:28.626
One. There's nothing wrong with
my eyes. It's my arms and my legs.

13:28.796 --> 13:31.750
Okay, Aaron, I need you
to lay absolutely still.

13:31.924 --> 13:34.926
No sign of cranial nerve impaction
or blowout fracture.

13:35.095 --> 13:37.171
Bilateral TM's clear. No blood.

13:37.347 --> 13:39.590
Does it hurt when I press here
or just the sides?

13:39.767 --> 13:41.428
- Both.
- Foreface is stable.

13:41.770 --> 13:43.928
No dental fractures.

13:44.105 --> 13:46.597
Okay. We're gonna leave
the collar on for a while.

13:47.151 --> 13:51.944
Let's tape down his head
and use sandbags to stabilize.

13:52.116 --> 13:53.859
- Can you feel this?
- No.

13:54.035 --> 13:56.074
- How's he doing?
- It's too early to tell.

13:56.245 --> 13:59.033
- Can he tell me what happened?
- It was a sledding accident.

13:59.207 --> 14:00.453
Yeah, his dad got smashed...

14:00.625 --> 14:03.710
...and was pulling him and his friend
on a sled behind a snowmobile.

14:03.880 --> 14:05.339
Smelled alcohol on his breath?

14:05.506 --> 14:08.342
No. But he seemed out of it.
Maybe drugs.

14:08.510 --> 14:11.844
Lungs are clear bilaterally.
Normal heart tones.

14:12.264 --> 14:14.257
- You going somewhere?
- What?

14:14.433 --> 14:16.926
That's the third time
you've looked at the clock.

14:17.438 --> 14:19.810
- Aaron, can you feel this?
- No.

14:19.982 --> 14:22.474
- What about now?
- No.

14:22.944 --> 14:24.652
- Anything?
- No.

14:24.821 --> 14:26.019
Why can't I feel my arms?

14:26.114 --> 14:28.321
Just relax. We're trying to help you.

14:28.492 --> 14:30.118
I'm gonna go speak with the father.

14:30.286 --> 14:32.362
Prep the Solu-Medrol,
hold the scanner.

14:32.539 --> 14:33.998
Okay, give me a reflex hammer.

14:36.251 --> 14:39.170
Mr. James, I'm Dr. Greene.
I'm treating your son, Aaron.

14:39.338 --> 14:40.537
He got hurt.

14:40.715 --> 14:42.672
He has no feeling in his arms and legs.

14:42.843 --> 14:44.836
We're sending him for x-rays
and an MRl.

14:45.012 --> 14:46.922
We'll have a better idea...

14:47.098 --> 14:49.933
...once the neurosurgeon's
had a chance to assess his injury.

14:50.102 --> 14:51.644
This is all my fault.

14:51.812 --> 14:54.683
You were pulling him and his friend
behind a snowmobile?

14:54.857 --> 14:56.981
I knew it was wrong.

14:57.652 --> 15:00.607
- You been drinking?
- You mean booze?

15:00.781 --> 15:02.026
No.

15:02.199 --> 15:04.073
I told them.

15:04.494 --> 15:07.067
- Told who?
- Aaron and Chris that we shouldn't.

15:07.247 --> 15:09.205
But they kept bugging me to.

15:09.583 --> 15:11.577
Well, that's where
adult judgment comes in.

15:11.753 --> 15:14.209
- Hey, idiot!
- Is there a problem?

15:14.380 --> 15:17.086
Yeah. My son's got a broken arm
thanks to Dumb and Dumber.

15:17.259 --> 15:19.548
- You could've killed them!
- It was an accident.

15:19.720 --> 15:22.343
- Settle down, sir.
- I'll settle down after he's arrested.

15:23.016 --> 15:25.722
Look, he shouldn't be allowed
to operate a motor vehicle.

15:25.895 --> 15:27.389
He's only got half a brain.

15:27.980 --> 15:30.935
I'm serious. His wife even left him
because he's lost it.

15:31.109 --> 15:33.232
Let's go over here and talk, sir.

15:33.403 --> 15:35.811
- Sorry about that.
- It's okay.

15:35.990 --> 15:39.201
He's kind of right. I would've never
done this before I was stupid.

15:39.368 --> 15:40.697
Here, sit down.

15:40.871 --> 15:42.413
What happened?

15:42.581 --> 15:45.832
July 17th, 1997. It was very hot.

15:46.002 --> 15:49.418
I took off my hardhat so I could
wipe the sweat off my forehead.

15:49.589 --> 15:53.291
And a pipe fell loose
from the fitting above me, and boom.

15:54.137 --> 15:55.251
Head injury?

15:55.346 --> 15:57.802
My brain doesn't work like it used to.

15:57.975 --> 16:01.012
- Does Aaron live with you now?
- Sometimes.

16:01.187 --> 16:04.722
We're buddies now.
We don't fight like we used to.

16:05.191 --> 16:07.315
- He's gonna get better, right?
- I hope so.

16:07.486 --> 16:10.772
Dr. Greene, Mrs. Nevinger's wondering
about an update on her husband.

16:11.241 --> 16:14.112
- I'll be back to tell you about your son.
- Thank you.

16:14.286 --> 16:15.946
- Get a red top on Mr. James.
- Sure.

16:16.122 --> 16:19.040
- Nobody's telling me anything.
- He's still in with the surgeon.

16:19.208 --> 16:22.126
Why don't you sit down here,
and I'll find out.

16:22.295 --> 16:25.048
Oh, Abby.
District attorney's office called.

16:25.215 --> 16:27.588
Your subpoena's been revoked.

16:27.761 --> 16:29.884
- Revoked?
- Trial's been canceled.

16:30.054 --> 16:31.633
What?

16:31.932 --> 16:34.886
- Why?
- I don't know. Some legal snafu, I guess.

16:35.061 --> 16:36.389
You know about lawyers.

16:36.480 --> 16:39.314
They're half as smart as doctors
but twice as sneaky.

16:46.199 --> 16:48.108
Ian, your wife's here.

16:48.285 --> 16:50.693
She wants to come in and see you.

16:50.871 --> 16:52.496
Is she alone?

16:52.665 --> 16:54.954
No. Your sons are with her.

16:56.419 --> 16:58.959
I don't want them to see me like this.

16:59.131 --> 17:02.548
I'm gonna have to put a tube down
your throat to protect your airway.

17:02.928 --> 17:06.511
Once I do that,
you won't be able to talk to them.

17:06.682 --> 17:08.057
I don't care.

17:09.185 --> 17:11.676
Your urine tested positive
for amphetamines.

17:12.396 --> 17:14.556
Want to tell me why?

17:14.733 --> 17:17.770
I've been working two jobs.

17:18.154 --> 17:21.689
Sometimes I need a little help
to keep me going.

17:22.200 --> 17:23.992
How do you take it?

17:27.707 --> 17:29.534
Do you smoke it?

17:32.922 --> 17:36.208
Did you light up
with all those fumes in the garage?

17:37.052 --> 17:39.045
I wanted to finish the dresser.

17:42.725 --> 17:45.181
Birthday's on Saturday.

17:48.065 --> 17:50.603
Hey, where have you been?

17:51.361 --> 17:53.188
Elizabeth.

17:55.199 --> 17:57.156
I was down in the ER.

17:57.326 --> 17:59.734
Let me guess. A rule-out appy
on a corpse?

17:59.912 --> 18:01.111
- No.
- Well, you're lucky.

18:01.289 --> 18:04.077
I'm starting to think "ER" stands
for "everyone's retarded. "

18:04.251 --> 18:08.415
Honestly, it's a wonder they all
find their way to work every day.

18:08.589 --> 18:12.209
Excuse me, Dr. Corday. Your nanny
called, said they're just leaving the hotel.

18:12.386 --> 18:13.584
Thanks.

18:13.763 --> 18:15.637
That sounds kinky.

18:16.432 --> 18:18.639
- Do you need something, Robert?
- Yes, actually.

18:18.810 --> 18:22.180
Your buddy Benton left us
with eight delinquent operative reports.

18:22.356 --> 18:24.433
He said he was stopping by
sometime this week.

18:24.609 --> 18:27.361
He wouldn't be caught dead here.
They are now your problem.

18:27.529 --> 18:29.902
- I'm not the operating surgeon.
- I don't give a damn.

18:30.073 --> 18:31.354
I want a dictated note on every chart...

18:31.450 --> 18:32.861
...before our JCAHO review.

18:33.035 --> 18:34.316
I'm being paged to the ER.

18:34.495 --> 18:37.782
If I don't have them by tomorrow,
I'll report him to the medical board.

18:37.958 --> 18:39.867
Someone is very popular today.

18:40.044 --> 18:42.962
Oh, Jerry, give me a break.

18:43.256 --> 18:45.296
I could have one of my buddies
on the force...

18:45.467 --> 18:47.674
...do a background check
on this Randall.

18:47.845 --> 18:50.716
- Isn't that nice to know.
- Now, what's that supposed to mean?

18:50.890 --> 18:55.469
It means that the continuing invasion of
personal privacy by law enforcement...

18:55.646 --> 18:57.722
...is appalling,
not to mention immoral.

18:57.898 --> 19:01.435
Well, you have nothing to worry about
if you don't have anything to hide.

19:01.612 --> 19:04.150
- Malcontent.
- Psycho fascist.

19:04.323 --> 19:06.115
- Now, that's it!
- Settle down, you two.

19:06.283 --> 19:09.119
- You wanna start something, tough guy?
- Bring it on, gramps.

19:09.288 --> 19:11.161
Gramps? Who are you calling gramps?

19:11.540 --> 19:14.874
Guys, stop it. Both of you,
stop it! Hey. Hey.

19:18.506 --> 19:19.917
- Look what you did.
- You did it.

19:20.092 --> 19:21.670
- Will you both shut up?
- You okay?

19:21.844 --> 19:24.762
- Can I get a doctor here?
- What happened?

19:24.931 --> 19:27.220
Dennis Cooper, 32.
Multiple GSWs to the chest.

19:27.309 --> 19:28.887
I got his 8-year-old daughter too.

19:29.061 --> 19:30.307
- Was she shot?
- No.

19:30.479 --> 19:31.760
Dad arrested about a minute out.

19:31.856 --> 19:33.481
No BP, but good pulse with CPR.

19:33.650 --> 19:36.900
All right. Somebody page Corday
and open a thoracotomy tray.

19:37.071 --> 19:38.102
Spreader.

19:38.197 --> 19:40.025
Okay, crank it open. Suction.

19:40.116 --> 19:41.147
What do you need?

19:41.242 --> 19:43.318
No. It slipped. I need to reset the lip.

19:43.412 --> 19:47.030
- I could use a subclavian.
- Eight French cordis introducer.

19:47.207 --> 19:48.666
Gallant's with the daughter.

19:48.835 --> 19:51.872
Paramedics don't think she's injured,
but she was covered in blood.

19:52.047 --> 19:53.422
I've got it, Kerry.

19:53.590 --> 19:56.213
- Open up the pericardium.
- Pick-up.

19:57.553 --> 19:58.799
What's her status, Gallant?

19:58.971 --> 20:02.840
She has a couple superficial abrasions.
No evidence of any penetrating injuries.

20:03.019 --> 20:04.976
I don't think any of this is her blood.

20:05.146 --> 20:07.222
Hey, who is your friend?

20:08.984 --> 20:11.902
The first officers on the scene
found her hiding under a table.

20:12.071 --> 20:15.737
By the looks of it, she saw everything,
including who shot her father.

20:19.580 --> 20:22.582
So what's your name?

20:22.750 --> 20:26.880
- I couldn't get her to say anything.
- Her name is Brianne Cooper.

20:27.047 --> 20:29.800
Brianne, I'm Dr. Weaver.

20:29.967 --> 20:32.922
And we're trying to make
your daddy better, okay?

20:33.096 --> 20:35.884
- Okay.
- All right.

20:36.058 --> 20:39.392
- Now, are you hurt?
- I don't think so.

20:39.604 --> 20:41.147
Did you see who shot your father?

20:41.314 --> 20:42.939
- Do you mind?
- I need to know.

20:43.108 --> 20:45.434
Yeah. And I need to make sure
that she's all right.

20:45.611 --> 20:48.862
- Wait outside until we're finished.
- Her father is known-

20:48.949 --> 20:50.111
Outside means outside.

20:54.247 --> 20:56.620
Should I call DCFS?

20:57.250 --> 20:58.828
Don't worry, Brianne.

20:59.002 --> 21:03.297
You and your daddy are safe here.
Nobody's gonna hurt you now, okay?

21:03.716 --> 21:05.874
- She wasn't hurt.
- Physically, no.

21:05.969 --> 21:08.377
But she's showing signs of
post-traumatic stress disorder.

21:08.555 --> 21:11.557
You have to wait until the psychiatrist
is finished with her.

21:11.725 --> 21:13.136
- How long will that take?
- Look.

21:13.311 --> 21:16.183
Some girl just saw somebody
put five bullets into her father.

21:16.356 --> 21:18.231
Yeah. And I need to know who did it.

21:18.400 --> 21:21.900
Her father's a well-known drug dealer
and a murder suspect in his own right.

21:22.072 --> 21:24.078
If whoever did this finds out
she was the only witness,

21:24.166 --> 21:25.825
...they may finish the job.

21:26.619 --> 21:30.534
- What about her mother?
- She's a junkie and a possible suspect.

21:30.706 --> 21:33.494
All right. Post an officer
outside her room,

21:33.627 --> 21:35.086
and I'll try to speak with her.

21:35.254 --> 21:36.499
Okay, fine.

21:36.673 --> 21:41.002
We did the best we could, but the bullet
passed through Mr. Cooper's aorta.

21:41.512 --> 21:44.881
- How's the little girl?
- She's still in shock.

21:45.058 --> 21:49.186
- You like me to speak to her for you?
- No, I think I should do it. But thanks.

21:49.938 --> 21:53.058
Sorry about the delay.
I got a little backed up.

21:53.234 --> 21:55.108
No problem.

21:55.696 --> 22:00.025
The whole procedure only takes about
40 minutes once we get started, okay?

22:01.536 --> 22:03.612
This frame provides reference points...

22:03.705 --> 22:07.205
...so we can pinpoint the tumor
with 201 separate gamma rays.

22:07.375 --> 22:09.119
Hope you're a good shot.

22:09.294 --> 22:11.869
Well, the machine's accurate
up to. 3 millimeters.

22:12.048 --> 22:15.168
- What if I sneeze?
- Just try not to.

22:15.344 --> 22:18.678
It could vaporize all the brain matter
in your skull cavity.

22:19.056 --> 22:22.722
Kidding, Dr. Greene. You won't be able
to move once we lock the frame down.

22:23.395 --> 22:26.065
- Any last questions?
- Nope.

22:26.232 --> 22:28.355
All right. See you in a few minutes.

22:35.744 --> 22:38.413
Just try and relax, Dr. Greene.

22:39.831 --> 22:41.655
I'm ready.

22:49.105 --> 22:51.596
- Has anybody seen Dr. Greene?
- He left.

22:51.774 --> 22:53.518
Already?

22:54.152 --> 22:57.237
- Did he say where he was going?
- Sorry.

22:57.739 --> 23:01.156
- We have an appointment.
- I can page him.

23:05.373 --> 23:07.531
You should take it easy
for the rest of the day.

23:07.708 --> 23:08.954
No problem.

23:09.127 --> 23:12.828
A few people report headaches,
nausea and vomiting.

23:13.006 --> 23:14.204
What about seizures?

23:14.383 --> 23:17.218
Less than 10 percent experience seizures
in the next 24 hours.

23:17.386 --> 23:19.047
But you' re on Dilantin...

23:19.221 --> 23:22.472
...and we gave you some Decadron
to reduce the risk of brain edema.

23:22.642 --> 23:25.928
- Is there someone to drive you home?
- I took the El.

23:26.271 --> 23:29.555
- Is someone staying with you tonight?
- My daughter.

23:29.733 --> 23:32.022
It would be better if it's an adult.

23:32.195 --> 23:33.737
Rachel's a teenager.

23:33.905 --> 23:37.357
Well, just have her check on you,
and call if there are any problems.

23:38.159 --> 23:42.454
Call Dr. Sanders and tell him
I can't see his patient until Monday.

23:42.623 --> 23:44.117
Yes, doctor.

23:44.291 --> 23:46.367
Reschedule Jenna Kline for Thursday.

23:46.544 --> 23:49.213
Fax Dr. Horton
Brook Yeung's MEG results.

23:49.297 --> 23:52.880
I'm Dr. Greene.
My daughter has an appointment.

23:53.050 --> 23:55.968
- Ella.
- Yeah. My wife should be bringing her.

23:56.138 --> 23:57.763
You just missed them.

23:57.931 --> 24:01.799
- Well, what does that mean exactly?
- In the interest of legal efficiency...

24:01.977 --> 24:04.303
- ... we cut a deal.
- A deal for what? For jail time?

24:04.480 --> 24:07.482
No. One year parole,
40 hours of community service.

24:07.650 --> 24:09.275
Community service?

24:09.444 --> 24:11.899
- This guy attacked me.
- This is his first offense.

24:12.072 --> 24:14.859
He's pathological. I've had
to call the police on him before.

24:15.034 --> 24:18.617
He has no prior arrests. We're also
insisting he undergo mandatory therapy.

24:18.788 --> 24:22.620
Oh, that's great. So, what, he counts
to 10 before he hits somebody now?

24:22.792 --> 24:25.164
- This is the best we could do.
- The best you can do?

24:25.337 --> 24:28.207
Let's not overlook that someone
beat the hell out of Westlake...

24:28.382 --> 24:31.003
...a couple hours
after you were attacked.

24:31.802 --> 24:33.594
- What?
- But...

24:33.762 --> 24:36.799
...you didn't know anything
about that, right?

24:37.434 --> 24:39.058
No.

24:44.150 --> 24:46.107
Wiggle your toes.

24:48.279 --> 24:50.105
Fingers.

24:52.743 --> 24:55.993
- I'm not paralyzed?
- You are showing signs of improvement.

24:56.162 --> 25:00.659
It's only gonna get better as the swelling
in your spinal cord goes down.

25:00.834 --> 25:02.827
You are lucky.

25:03.004 --> 25:04.961
Put this behind you.

25:05.298 --> 25:08.169
Your dad is gonna be glad
to hear this.

25:09.385 --> 25:12.837
You know, the police think
that he was drinking.

25:13.014 --> 25:14.295
My dad doesn't drink.

25:15.058 --> 25:17.764
They're pretty angry
about what he did.

25:17.937 --> 25:20.135
Pulling you behind a snowmobile,

25:20.170 --> 25:21.884
your dad should know better.

25:22.019 --> 25:25.275
- He does.
- Then what happened?

25:28.740 --> 25:31.991
It wasn't your dad's idea to pull you
behind the snowmobile, was it?

25:38.752 --> 25:42.335
It was Chris' idea.
We were just trying to have a little fun.

25:42.506 --> 25:44.214
Elizabeth?

25:46.844 --> 25:49.133
- Where were you?
- I'm sorry. Something came up.

25:49.306 --> 25:53.303
- More important than our daughter?
- I was there. I just missed you.

25:53.477 --> 25:56.430
I talked to the doctor.
Everything's gonna be okay.

25:56.647 --> 25:59.897
Yeah. Well, any long-term effects
remain to be seen, don't they?

26:01.318 --> 26:04.984
Dr. Greene, Ian Nevinger's sats
are down to 78.

26:05.156 --> 26:08.525
I'm down for a GSW. You better hope
you can still intubate him.

26:08.702 --> 26:12.285
- You still awake in here?
- A little.

26:16.793 --> 26:20.413
Brianne, I have some bad news...

26:20.590 --> 26:22.381
...about your father.

26:22.551 --> 26:25.717
The surgeons did their best
to help him.

26:25.887 --> 26:29.755
But one of the bullets hit his heart
and damaged it.

26:29.933 --> 26:32.639
They couldn't fix it.

26:34.021 --> 26:35.895
He died.

26:38.819 --> 26:40.610
I know it's hard...

26:40.779 --> 26:43.104
...and you feel really sad.

26:43.949 --> 26:47.235
But it's very important
that you talk with the police.

26:48.663 --> 26:50.038
No.

26:50.707 --> 26:53.280
They just want to make sure
they find out who did this...

26:53.459 --> 26:55.951
...so that they don't hurt anyone else.

26:56.338 --> 26:59.541
Did you see who shot your father?

27:00.634 --> 27:02.295
Yes.

27:03.304 --> 27:04.929
And do you know who they were?

27:07.266 --> 27:08.975
Yes.

27:09.478 --> 27:11.020
Will you tell the police?

27:12.481 --> 27:14.106
I can't.

27:14.274 --> 27:16.980
Honey, you don't need to be afraid.

27:20.406 --> 27:24.071
- Was it your mother?
- No.

27:25.370 --> 27:27.078
Then who?

27:28.290 --> 27:29.868
Me.

27:31.836 --> 27:33.378
You.

27:33.546 --> 27:35.040
You shot your father?

27:36.799 --> 27:41.213
He fell asleep on the couch
and left his gun on the coffee table.

27:43.682 --> 27:44.962
Why did you shoot him?

27:49.814 --> 27:51.439
Brianne...

27:51.524 --> 27:52.935
...was he hurting you?

27:54.027 --> 27:57.194
Honey, was he doing things to you
that he shouldn't be?

27:57.364 --> 28:00.151
He wouldn't let me watch TV.

28:02.370 --> 28:03.650
So you shot him?

28:04.456 --> 28:09.201
He said if I turned on the TV
while he was asleep, he'd shoot me.

28:09.377 --> 28:12.130
So I shot him first.

28:22.309 --> 28:24.716
He can't protect his airway
much longer.

28:24.895 --> 28:28.261
- Can we go in before you intubate him?
- He'd prefer if you didn't.

28:28.858 --> 28:31.313
This is the last chance
we'll have to speak with him.

28:32.236 --> 28:34.989
He doesn't want you to see him
in his present condition.

28:35.156 --> 28:36.401
I've seen worse.

28:36.575 --> 28:39.410
- This is your husband.
- Yes, he is.

28:42.456 --> 28:45.707
- If they stay here.
- Okay.

28:45.876 --> 28:48.546
Brendan, watch your brother.
I have to talk to the doctor.

28:52.717 --> 28:55.291
Carboxyhemoglobin's 30.

28:56.638 --> 28:59.308
- I said no.
- I said yes.

28:59.891 --> 29:02.465
You're gonna be okay, Ian.

29:03.062 --> 29:05.019
How's my hair look?

29:05.190 --> 29:07.763
You might want to get a wig
till it grows back.

29:09.027 --> 29:11.435
Maybe I can get an Afro, huh?

29:11.613 --> 29:12.859
Haleh, suction.

29:13.031 --> 29:15.903
I can do that. I'm an RN.

29:20.373 --> 29:22.330
- I'm sorry.
- Don't talk.

29:22.501 --> 29:24.410
- Burn unit have any beds?
- Holding.

29:24.503 --> 29:26.376
He's gonna need
a Swan-Ganz catheter.

29:26.547 --> 29:29.120
- Are these his labs?
- Some of them.

29:29.509 --> 29:31.382
He tested positive for amphetamines?

29:32.095 --> 29:35.215
- Were you smoking up?
- It was an accident.

29:35.390 --> 29:38.759
You lied to me. You told me you'd
stay clean. You promised me you'd quit.

29:38.935 --> 29:41.058
- I did.
- Was it good?

29:41.230 --> 29:44.764
- Did you get nice and stoned?
- I just wanted to finish the dresser.

29:44.942 --> 29:47.897
No, Ian. You just wanted to get high!

29:48.654 --> 29:51.572
- Pam-
- Let's get the heliox started.

30:17.687 --> 30:21.139
- Chuny, have you seen Mrs. Nevinger?
- No, sorry.

30:21.316 --> 30:22.514
What's going on?

30:22.692 --> 30:25.896
We're trying to decide what to do
with Aaron. Can't reach the mother.

30:26.155 --> 30:28.313
The father's blood alcohol level
was negative.

30:28.490 --> 30:30.613
Yes. But what he did
was still reckless.

30:30.827 --> 30:35.406
I don't want to split up this family, but
the father is as much a kid as his son.

30:35.581 --> 30:38.701
The boys talked him into it.
They should take some of the blame.

30:39.127 --> 30:42.414
- You need to talk to them.
- I did, and they didn't say anything.

30:45.718 --> 30:49.052
Hey. Did you talk to the social worker
and the police?

30:49.222 --> 30:51.547
- Yeah.
- What did you tell them?

30:51.725 --> 30:53.551
What do you care?

30:54.228 --> 30:56.684
- You worried about getting in trouble?
- No.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.682
What is it, then?

30:59.900 --> 31:03.566
- You want your dad to get arrested?
- Maybe it'll smarten him up.

31:04.406 --> 31:05.780
What?

31:05.949 --> 31:09.650
My dad's always doing stupid stuff
and saying things that are embarrassing.

31:10.078 --> 31:12.865
Every teenager thinks that
about their parents.

31:13.040 --> 31:16.326
Yeah. But my dad's really a moron.

31:19.088 --> 31:21.758
Well, you won't have
to worry about that...

31:21.925 --> 31:24.879
...once Child Services
puts you into a foster family.

31:25.429 --> 31:28.347
- He could've said no.
- Could he?

31:30.852 --> 31:33.259
You think your father likes
what happened to him?

31:33.438 --> 31:35.929
He lost his wife. He lost his job.

31:36.107 --> 31:37.732
He lost himself.

31:38.193 --> 31:40.269
You're the only thing he has left.

31:40.613 --> 31:42.854
And he still thinks
that you two are buddies.

31:43.616 --> 31:44.814
We are.

31:45.118 --> 31:48.533
Well, then you need to grow up
and start acting like one.

31:50.456 --> 31:53.458
- Are the cops still here?
- They might be.

31:54.044 --> 31:57.745
- Well, can I talk to them again?
- I'll see what I can do.

31:57.923 --> 32:00.462
And could you tell my dad I'm sorry?

32:00.635 --> 32:03.968
No, but you can.

32:53.692 --> 32:56.018
Why are you still here?

32:56.820 --> 32:59.739
- I'm on till 8.
- You shouldn't be on at all.

32:59.907 --> 33:03.775
- Do you have a headache?
- Just... Just a little stress.

33:03.953 --> 33:06.527
Yeah. That and several hundred
beams of radiation...

33:06.707 --> 33:09.412
...zapped into your brain
this afternoon.

33:09.585 --> 33:11.792
You need to go home.

33:12.297 --> 33:15.084
There's just a half an hour left.

33:15.257 --> 33:17.334
- Did you tell her?
- Who?

33:17.510 --> 33:19.135
Mark.

33:21.848 --> 33:23.888
You said you were gonna talk to her.

33:24.060 --> 33:25.968
Does Rachel know?

33:26.521 --> 33:28.513
Mark, they're gonna figure it out.

33:28.690 --> 33:30.563
Let them figure it out.

33:30.734 --> 33:32.773
So you're gonna keep this a secret...

33:32.944 --> 33:36.147
...act like nothing's wrong
until you pass out in public?

33:36.323 --> 33:40.155
The moment you tell them,
they start treating you differently.

33:41.036 --> 33:42.994
They start giving you that look.

33:43.164 --> 33:44.409
What look?

33:44.582 --> 33:49.244
That look. That look like you're
half-dead, like you're already gone.

33:50.255 --> 33:53.173
Believe me, I've seen it before.

33:54.010 --> 33:55.753
Yeah. Well, you're still here.

34:00.725 --> 34:02.350
Good night.

34:04.730 --> 34:06.972
- What is it?
- Nothing.

34:07.149 --> 34:09.475
- Mark.
- I'm just a little nauseous.

34:09.652 --> 34:12.985
- That's it. I'm taking you home.
- No. I am not going home.

34:13.156 --> 34:14.697
You have two choices.

34:14.866 --> 34:18.697
I am taking you home right now or I'm
ratting you out to Weaver. What'll it be?

34:21.040 --> 34:23.578
You'd better not vomit in my car.

34:24.002 --> 34:27.085
The burn unit's ready
for Nevinger, Dr. Corday.

34:27.255 --> 34:30.255
- Haleh, do we have Marcaine?
- Right in front of you.

34:30.425 --> 34:31.670
Right.

34:31.842 --> 34:35.379
Can you take him up? I don't want
to lose his airway in the elevator.

34:35.554 --> 34:37.714
- Who?
- Nevinger, the surface burn.

34:37.891 --> 34:39.268
I thought he was intubated.

34:39.351 --> 34:42.389
He's stabilized on a heliox,
but he's drifting down again.

34:42.563 --> 34:44.391
He's Dr. Greene's patient. Ask him.

34:44.483 --> 34:45.679
Dr. Greene went home.

34:45.858 --> 34:47.567
- He did?
- Half-hour ago.

34:47.735 --> 34:50.062
It says "Corday" on the chart.

34:50.531 --> 34:52.072
Fine.

34:54.077 --> 34:56.994
Mr. Nevinger, how's your breathing?

34:57.163 --> 34:59.240
- Did you find her?
- Who?

34:59.416 --> 35:01.243
My wife.

35:01.626 --> 35:03.453
She isn't here?

35:03.628 --> 35:06.546
Dr. Corday, sats down to 9 percent.

35:06.715 --> 35:10.797
Point-eight of Pav,
prep 20 of etomidate, 120 of sux.

35:10.970 --> 35:14.553
Mr. Nevinger, we're going to have
to intubate you for transfer.

35:14.724 --> 35:17.394
You might not be able to talk
for a few days...

35:17.561 --> 35:19.601
...but your wife will be able
to talk to you.

35:19.772 --> 35:21.396
I let her down.

35:21.566 --> 35:23.689
Tested positive for amphetamines.

35:23.859 --> 35:25.899
Promised her.

35:26.071 --> 35:28.526
All you need to worry about now
is getting better.

35:28.699 --> 35:30.109
8- O ET tube.

35:30.284 --> 35:34.199
Even if I live, she'll leave me.

35:34.371 --> 35:36.411
Oh, I'm sure that's not true.

35:38.793 --> 35:41.664
Wouldn't you? I mean, look at me.

35:42.923 --> 35:46.624
Things might be difficult
for both of you for a while, yes.

35:47.052 --> 35:49.626
But you just need
to give her some time.

35:50.598 --> 35:53.089
- Could you find her?
- Meds are in.

35:53.267 --> 35:57.136
Tell her I love her, I'm sorry.

35:57.480 --> 35:59.308
Yes, of course.

35:59.482 --> 36:02.318
- Yankauer tip and a 3-mac.
- Got it. Bag him.

36:02.486 --> 36:04.526
No. I had Debbie pick up the kids.

36:04.696 --> 36:05.977
Okay.

36:06.156 --> 36:09.361
Thanks, Evelyn. No, I will. I will.

36:09.536 --> 36:11.113
Yeah. Bye.

36:11.287 --> 36:13.695
Mrs. Nevinger? I'm Dr. Corday.

36:13.873 --> 36:15.950
I helped work on your husband.

36:16.126 --> 36:18.700
They told me you were in Chairs.
I was afraid you'd left.

36:18.879 --> 36:22.165
No, I'm leaving now. I just called
Ian's mom. She's coming.

36:22.341 --> 36:25.213
I didn't tell her about the drugs.
I should.

36:25.386 --> 36:26.881
I should let the boys see him.

36:26.971 --> 36:29.179
Show them what drugs did to their father.

36:29.349 --> 36:30.761
They'll see that soon enough.

36:30.934 --> 36:32.974
Assuming we're still around
when he gets out.

36:33.145 --> 36:35.471
We've just moved your husband
up to the burns unit.

36:35.648 --> 36:37.357
Look,
I know what he did was wrong...

36:37.525 --> 36:40.017
...and obviously you have
some things to work out...

36:40.111 --> 36:42.567
...but he really needs you right now.

36:42.739 --> 36:44.982
Yeah? What about me?

36:45.159 --> 36:48.859
What about my sons? They really need
a father, but they don't have one now.

36:49.122 --> 36:50.366
Yes, they do.

36:50.540 --> 36:52.532
No. They have a drug addict in a hospital...

36:52.626 --> 36:54.867
with burns over 50 percent of his body.

36:55.044 --> 36:57.715
He's still their father.
He's still your husband.

37:00.426 --> 37:04.720
You do know that he could succumb to
infection and die within the next week?

37:04.889 --> 37:07.891
That is not my fault.
I begged him to stop using drugs.

37:08.518 --> 37:11.519
- I'm certain he's sorry for what he did.
- Is he?

37:11.688 --> 37:15.521
Mrs. Nevinger,
he's in unbelievable pain.

37:15.693 --> 37:17.270
He'll be permanently disfigured.

37:17.444 --> 37:20.944
He'll never look
like the father your sons remember.

37:21.116 --> 37:23.572
I think he's suffered enough punishment,
don't you?

37:25.412 --> 37:28.912
You two can go home.
You're both suspended until Monday.

37:29.082 --> 37:31.206
- For what?
- For fighting.

37:31.377 --> 37:32.408
We weren't fighting.

37:32.503 --> 37:34.377
I was told you two got into a fistfight.

37:34.547 --> 37:37.383
I'm afraid somebody's pulling
your leg, chief, so to speak.

37:37.550 --> 37:40.422
Yeah. I love this old guy.

37:40.596 --> 37:45.472
Dr. Chen, did you or did you not witness
these two getting into an altercation?

37:45.643 --> 37:48.597
- What altercation?
- You were knocked to the floor.

37:48.771 --> 37:52.604
No. I tripped over a phone cord earlier,
but that was my own fault.

37:56.071 --> 37:58.942
Hey, knock it off, you two.

37:59.116 --> 38:02.818
Carter. Just the man I want to see.
Look. I got six patients for you.

38:02.995 --> 38:04.788
- Not on for eight minutes.
- You're here.

38:04.956 --> 38:06.498
- But I'm eating.
- Well, too bad.

38:06.666 --> 38:08.160
Jing-Mei?

38:08.334 --> 38:09.615
Randall.

38:09.794 --> 38:13.246
I've been calling you all day. Did you...?
Did you get my flowers?

38:13.924 --> 38:16.415
Yes. Thanks.

38:16.802 --> 38:18.048
So are you off?

38:19.389 --> 38:20.883
You know, actually, I have-

38:21.058 --> 38:23.050
Aren't you covering Dr. Greene?

38:23.143 --> 38:24.175
Yes. Yes, I am.

38:24.353 --> 38:26.310
Well, what about after that?

38:32.528 --> 38:36.582
Look, Randall,
you're a nice guy and all but...

38:36.617 --> 38:38.865
...I just don't think
this is gonna work out between us.

38:39.661 --> 38:41.037
Well, I had fun.

38:42.331 --> 38:44.703
Yeah. Sorry.
I've gotta get back to work.

38:45.084 --> 38:46.875
Can I call you?

38:48.004 --> 38:49.249
No.

38:52.384 --> 38:53.962
Bye.

38:55.095 --> 38:57.586
Don't tell me you just broke up
with that guy.

38:57.765 --> 39:00.304
It was hardly a breakup.
I mean, we just went out once.

39:00.476 --> 39:02.802
- One date and he buys flowers?
- Can you believe it?

39:02.979 --> 39:05.850
You give a guy hand-release
during Harry Potter...

39:05.941 --> 39:07.186
and he wants to marry you.

39:07.359 --> 39:09.067
You okay?

39:10.529 --> 39:12.403
Thank you.

39:32.929 --> 39:34.589
Hi.

39:36.058 --> 39:38.097
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

39:38.436 --> 39:39.894
Nope.

39:43.107 --> 39:45.599
- Hey, Abby?
- Hey.

39:46.486 --> 39:49.024
- Come on in.
- No, I-

39:49.198 --> 39:51.985
I just wanted to say hi.
I didn't know you had company.

39:52.159 --> 39:53.654
No. Just a couple of friends.

39:54.328 --> 39:55.360
I'll see you tomorrow.

39:55.454 --> 39:58.242
You need a place to stay, let me help.

39:58.666 --> 40:01.703
- It's okay, really.
- Please? For me.

40:02.421 --> 40:03.665
I need you.

40:04.423 --> 40:06.879
They're kicking my ass in Pictionary.

40:07.051 --> 40:08.758
Come on.

40:13.391 --> 40:15.183
Three lap cholys, two inguinal hernias,

40:15.268 --> 40:16.597
LeFort III reduction...

40:16.770 --> 40:19.261
...vagotomy
and a pancreaticoduodenectomy.

40:19.439 --> 40:22.643
I only assisted on the LeFort.
Daniels was the primary.

40:22.818 --> 40:24.645
Well, Daniels has moved to Las Vegas.

40:24.821 --> 40:26.944
Growing demand
for breast implants, apparently.

40:27.114 --> 40:30.116
Yeah. Well, I guess I should've
moved further away myself.

40:30.743 --> 40:32.903
This doesn't have to be
so clandestine, Peter.

40:33.080 --> 40:35.998
You won't burst into flames
if you step inside the hospital.

40:36.166 --> 40:38.456
I know. I just wanted
to make a clean break.

40:38.628 --> 40:40.952
Yeah. Well, finish those
and you'll be free of us.

40:41.130 --> 40:43.123
Oh, and you owe me $27 for Xerox.

40:43.841 --> 40:45.122
How's the baby?

40:45.302 --> 40:47.591
Normal background rhythms,
low amp activity.

40:47.763 --> 40:49.886
All right, make sure you get SSEPs.

40:50.056 --> 40:52.465
You seem to be holding up okay.

40:53.060 --> 40:54.769
Yeah.

40:55.646 --> 40:57.224
What?

40:58.232 --> 40:59.691
What?

41:00.735 --> 41:02.775
I think I may have left my husband.

41:04.573 --> 41:08.357
- You think?
- Well, I moved out. I'm living in a hotel.

41:08.953 --> 41:10.697
What happened?

41:11.831 --> 41:16.209
I've never made demands on him,
not real ones anyway.

41:16.378 --> 41:19.332
The only time I ask him
to put his family first, he can't do it.

41:19.715 --> 41:22.586
- Back up. You lost me.
- He won't send Rachel away.

41:22.760 --> 41:24.837
It's like he has to prove he loves her.

41:25.471 --> 41:28.176
You want him to prove he loves you.

41:28.266 --> 41:29.547
Yes. No.

41:30.978 --> 41:32.887
I don't know.

41:33.981 --> 41:36.768
I don't know if I'm protecting
my daughter or just angry.

41:37.068 --> 41:40.152
- Look, Elizabeth, I'd be angry too-
- At Mark.

41:41.531 --> 41:45.197
You see, I think I do blame him
for what happened.

41:46.536 --> 41:51.495
And I think I've found a way to avoid
being with him because I blame him.

41:55.630 --> 41:57.669
He's different.

41:58.508 --> 41:59.753
It's like he's...

41:59.927 --> 42:02.299
It's like he's disconnected
from us somehow.

42:03.556 --> 42:06.047
Or maybe it's me, you know?

42:06.225 --> 42:09.345
I just don't have the energy
to figure it out.

42:10.855 --> 42:13.263
What happens if he
sent Rachel home tomorrow?

42:21.743 --> 42:23.201
Usually this time of year,

42:23.286 --> 42:25.528
...Chicagoans
are tired of the cold and snow...

42:25.705 --> 42:27.745
...wondering if winter will ever end...

42:27.916 --> 42:29.161
You' re out of mustard.

42:30.085 --> 42:34.083
- I told you, I'm not hungry.
- You have to eat.

42:34.256 --> 42:37.543
That's right.
Starve a cold, feed a tumor.

42:37.719 --> 42:40.127
You need to keep your strength up.

42:40.597 --> 42:42.007
I need to take a nap.

42:42.182 --> 42:44.507
Well, I'll help you upstairs
if you have some soup.

42:44.685 --> 42:48.018
No, I mean right now, right here.

42:49.273 --> 42:51.847
What if Rachel comes home?
She'll see you're sick.

42:52.026 --> 42:54.564
She's sleeping over at a friend's.

42:55.154 --> 42:56.779
Mark, you have to have
someone watch you...

42:56.865 --> 42:59.272
following Gamma Knife therapy.

42:59.451 --> 43:02.156
- Oh, great.
- What?

43:03.414 --> 43:05.786
I can't close my eye.

43:06.417 --> 43:09.253
I've heard of cowboys
who sleep with one eye open.

43:10.380 --> 43:12.373
I'm glad you think this is funny.

43:13.467 --> 43:15.259
Okay.

43:20.099 --> 43:21.926
Hold still.

43:26.982 --> 43:29.604
You'll have to start using artificial tears.

43:29.693 --> 43:30.724
Yeah.

43:35.825 --> 43:37.699
How's that?

43:37.869 --> 43:40.158
It's good. Thanks.

43:45.878 --> 43:48.150
Don't let the soup get cold, huh?

44:27.145 --> 44:30.189
