Thank you for choosing

I hope the trip was as good

Not my mp

01:28.875 --> 01:30.542
Phone - I'm sorry.

01:31.209 --> 01:33.125

01:48.834 --> 01:51.542

01:51.709 --> 01:54.292
In addition, it is broken, the phone.

01:54.459 --> 01:55.500
It is broken!

01:59.959 --> 02:03.917
Is it you who draw
zizis on my car? Here!

02:04.209 --> 02:06.875
So! If there is anyone yet

02:07.042 --> 02:11.084
who draws a zizi on my taxi,
he will deal with me.

02:11.500 --> 02:12.667
It's understood?

02:20.167 --> 02:24.375
5 people you are looking for.
The odds I will take!

02:24.542 --> 02:28.750
You'll take nothing: I'm innocent.
- You'll tell that to the commissioner.

02:28.917 --> 02:33.542
Do you mind if you take a shortcut?
- Go ahead, I fight my balls.

02:35.500 --> 02:37.792
If you take it like that.

04:39.959 --> 04:40.917

04:41.084 --> 04:42.709
If that, it does not accelerate my mutation

04:42.875 --> 04:44.000

Sit down.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.209
Marot, I pass on the expenses

04:54.375 --> 04:57.667
tire of your vehicle...
- It's just tires.

04:57.834 --> 05:00.500
There is a bigger problem.
- I listen.

05:00.667 --> 05:02.500
Do you know Christelle Bucherot?

05:03.959 --> 05:06.792
Christelle... I knew a lot...

spent the night yesterday.

05:11.125 --> 05:13.125
Christelle, of course!

05:14.000 --> 05:17.209
She is fine? I did not stay...
- The farm.

05:17.500 --> 05:18.750
What is the name of the prefect?

05:19.417 --> 05:20.375
Mr. Prefect...

05:21.500 --> 05:23.542
It's Mr. Prefect...

05:23.709 --> 05:25.292
Jean-Bertrand...
- Bucherot.

05:25.459 --> 05:27.334
Ah, here we are, Bucherot.

05:27.500 --> 05:30.542
It's funny, suddenly, it's the same name.

05:30.709 --> 05:32.292
There is a family link

05:32.459 --> 05:35.792
or of... maybe alliance?

05:38.000 --> 05:38.750
His wife.

05:39.375 --> 05:40.125
It,

05:40.292 --> 05:42.167
she had not said it.
- Thanks to

05:42.334 --> 05:45.250
your service records, you
will not be written off.

05:45.417 --> 05:46.792
But you are mutated

05:46.959 --> 05:48.334

05:49.667 --> 05:53.125
It is not the RAID I imagine?
- Oh no.

05:53.292 --> 05:54.792
No...
- To the police

05:54.959 --> 05:56.000
Municipal.

05:57.500 --> 05:58.375
From Marseille.

05:58.542 --> 06:00.000

06:06.834 --> 06:07.500
Yes...

06:07.667 --> 06:12.750
It does not suit me, it's far from Paris...
- Marot, it's like that.

06:15.334 --> 06:16.625
He sobs.

06:18.250 --> 06:19.709
You can dispose.

06:21.959 --> 06:23.375
You have no heart.

06:26.709 --> 06:27.500

06:53.084 --> 06:55.125
It will reassure you.
- Ah yes?

06:55.292 --> 06:56.584
Killer team!

06:57.667 --> 06:58.542
Dynamic.

06:59.292 --> 07:00.709
Tenors. First,

07:00.875 --> 07:02.417
you see the guy sitting,

07:02.584 --> 07:05.292
the big bearded, weird, is Menard.

07:05.459 --> 07:07.834
For the atmosphere, it's impeccable.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.500
He is super nice, open, all that.

07:10.875 --> 07:12.042
squeak

07:12.709 --> 07:17.125
He's bullshit when he gets bored.
And he's bored a lot.

07:20.250 --> 07:22.667
General alert! Intervention!

07:22.834 --> 07:24.334
Rhythmic music

07:27.834 --> 07:28.750
They cough.

07:29.250 --> 07:31.917
Did you go to a shisha bar?

07:32.084 --> 07:33.209
Bastard!

07:33.750 --> 07:34.459
And the dwarf,

07:34.625 --> 07:37.292
it's regulatory?
- Here, out of respect,

07:37.459 --> 07:40.167
we do not say "the dwarf".
- Oh ok.

07:40.334 --> 07:42.542
We say nobody of small size.

07:43.500 --> 07:46.459
So the dwarf is Michel.
Him, what he loves

07:46.625 --> 07:49.125
it's the miniature:
model making, model...

07:49.292 --> 07:50.334
he has not a head

07:50.500 --> 07:53.667
to be called Michel.
- He was called Abdelrrahmane,

07:53.834 --> 07:57.084
but since his conversion to
Christianity, it's Michel.

07:57.792 --> 08:00.584
Ah yes?
- Obliged. He found faith.

08:00.750 --> 08:04.334
Since then, we feast on all
the religious holidays.

08:04.500 --> 08:07.709
At Christmas, he wants cribs everywhere.

08:07.875 --> 08:09.084
It's hard.
- Amen.

08:09.250 --> 08:11.667
And when he sees nuns,

08:11.834 --> 08:14.334
he is very excited.
Is he radicalized?

08:14.500 --> 08:15.167
Yes.

08:16.125 --> 08:19.209
It's exhausting. And opposite, the other,

08:19.375 --> 08:21.584
with his head pervert, it's Regis.

08:21.750 --> 08:22.625
We laugh more.

08:22.792 --> 08:23.667
Not in the eyes.

08:23.834 --> 08:24.625
Do not?

08:24.792 --> 08:26.250
Please.
- Ah?

08:27.084 --> 08:29.292
Regis, he loves spying:

08:29.459 --> 08:32.292
he was watching his
wife, but she left him.

08:32.708 --> 08:36.000
I understand it.
- Do not look at him, please.

08:36.167 --> 08:39.625
Since then, he has become
a geolocation pro.

08:40.500 --> 08:43.500
Well, are there girls in the brigade?

08:44.875 --> 08:48.000
I was going to come there.
Attention regal.

08:48.959 --> 08:50.084
There, right.

08:50.959 --> 08:52.209
It hurts the eyes.

08:52.709 --> 08:55.625
Sandrine, the hottie of the brigade.
- The hottie?

08:55.792 --> 08:57.875
Attention, man-eating.

08:58.042 --> 09:00.917
Elected Miss Police Municipal Region PACA

09:01.084 --> 09:03.417

09:03.875 --> 09:05.875
Oh! A piece.

09:06.042 --> 09:09.500
Yes, a piece.
- It's heavy, we laugh more.

09:09.667 --> 09:11.375
Very heavy.
- Look at this.

09:13.542 --> 09:17.542
And at the level of the
vehicles, are you equipped?

09:18.584 --> 09:20.292
Do you like cars?
- Yes.

09:20.459 --> 09:21.584
You'll be served.

09:32.625 --> 09:33.500
You were hungry.

09:33.667 --> 09:36.917

09:45.125 --> 09:47.000
Do you miss a door?

09:48.750 --> 09:53.417
Yes, she is under revision:
people do not do enough to overhaul!

09:53.584 --> 09:55.042
You take me for a con?

09:55.625 --> 09:59.334
No, that's right.
- Already I'm upside down, there,

09:59.500 --> 10:00.250

10:00.417 --> 10:02.209
It's not the day! You saw

10:03.292 --> 10:04.334
No.

- No. Yes, my girlfriend calls me.

10:08.959 --> 10:09.750
Sorry.

My dad is not here, you come
to give me an express hug?

10:19.167 --> 10:21.625
Hottie.
- Yes, but I can not,

10:21.792 --> 10:24.709
<i>I have to go see Rene
to talk about the game.</i>

10:24.875 --> 10:26.084

You master nothing.

11:39.250 --> 11:41.500
You're crazy mad! He is crazy.

11:42.042 --> 11:43.084
We will do

11:43.250 --> 11:44.667
a great team.

11:45.125 --> 11:49.000
It should not be attached too much,
I must be transferred to RAID,

11:49.167 --> 11:51.709
so I will not stay in
Marseille too much.

11:53.417 --> 11:54.334
You think?

12:03.250 --> 12:04.042
Bus Lane!

12:07.000 --> 12:08.292
Finish the sandwich.

12:11.875 --> 12:13.000
Local police!

12:13.167 --> 12:14.209
We stop.

12:14.375 --> 12:15.000
What does he do?

12:15.167 --> 12:16.000
Stop!

12:16.667 --> 12:17.625
He will push himself

12:17.792 --> 12:18.917
this con, there!

12:19.084 --> 12:20.000
He stops this con, there.

12:21.417 --> 12:22.084
Oh!

12:25.834 --> 12:26.542
Oh!

12:26.709 --> 12:27.875
Whore!

12:28.709 --> 12:29.667
Oh...

12:29.834 --> 12:31.875
Fada! You've built a conde.

12:32.042 --> 12:34.209
But it's not that his way to him!

12:34.375 --> 12:35.375
Honey!

12:35.542 --> 12:37.459
My little cat, how are you?

12:37.625 --> 12:41.167
No! Why me?
- Wait, I'm fine!

12:41.334 --> 12:42.167
It's okay!

12:42.334 --> 12:45.709
Just say police, otherwise
they do not stop.

12:45.875 --> 12:47.125
I'll do it.

12:47.292 --> 12:48.625
I will do it!

12:48.792 --> 12:52.584
You do not have to come,
you're going to delay me.

12:56.334 --> 12:59.667
Attach your belt!
- I'm excited!

13:00.584 --> 13:01.459
You come?

13:01.625 --> 13:05.917
I stay here, in case he
comes back, for the search.

13:08.334 --> 13:09.084
Go!

13:10.167 --> 13:11.500
Mermaid

13:16.667 --> 13:18.500
For once, it's not me.

13:21.667 --> 13:24.792
he looks angry and more.
- You surprise me!

13:24.959 --> 13:26.750
You're a madman!
- In 2018,

13:26.917 --> 13:30.959
they put themselves on the path to stop us!
It's normal?

13:31.125 --> 13:32.125
What an idiot!

13:32.292 --> 13:33.625
Sorry?
- I'm not fine.

13:34.834 --> 13:36.667
Let me focus,

13:36.834 --> 13:37.292
OK?

13:37.459 --> 13:38.834
She does not advance!

13:43.417 --> 13:44.500
OH!

13:46.459 --> 13:48.375
Wait. Help me.

13:48.542 --> 13:49.792
It is on 2 wheels.

13:49.959 --> 13:51.709
Must be counterbalanced.

13:51.875 --> 13:53.834
Okay.
- Go! Go!

13:54.000 --> 13:55.042
I do not want!

13:55.625 --> 13:56.792
Like this.
- No!

13:56.959 --> 13:58.500
Come on.

13:58.667 --> 14:00.167
shouting

14:00.334 --> 14:01.625
We'll turn around.

14:01.792 --> 14:04.792
The car is in crab!
- What is that?

14:04.959 --> 14:06.292
Counterbalance.

14:06.459 --> 14:08.417
One two Three.

14:11.209 --> 14:13.667
Come on, stay in your corner.
- Yes.

14:13.834 --> 14:15.167
That's it, they arrive.

14:15.334 --> 14:16.959
I am not well.
- What do you mean?

14:17.125 --> 14:18.667
I'm going to stack!

14:18.834 --> 14:20.250
You do not throw up here!

14:20.584 --> 14:22.875
I am going to throw up.
- Do you want to stack?

14:24.625 --> 14:25.959
shouting

14:27.209 --> 14:28.334
it rains behind.

14:28.500 --> 14:29.042
Oh no!

14:29.209 --> 14:30.167
'I'm not fine...

14:30.334 --> 14:31.667
It's okay?
- Abuse you.

14:31.834 --> 14:34.167
It's better?
- Rigole, con that you are.

14:34.917 --> 14:35.542
He did it on purpose.

14:35.709 --> 14:36.334
'I'm not fine.

14:36.500 --> 14:37.334
Oh no!

14:37.500 --> 14:39.334

- No.

14:47.834 --> 14:48.875
shouting

14:51.500 --> 14:54.709
Still there? We'll see
if you know Marseille well.

14:57.125 --> 14:58.000

15:13.000 --> 15:14.750
Come on, make an effort.

15:14.917 --> 15:16.209

The municipal
police, fada or what?

Who are you?

15:34.542 --> 15:35.750
Empowered that you are.

15:35.917 --> 15:38.000
He does not know Marseille.
- Leash.

15:38.167 --> 15:41.000
We know who you are, Mr.
super cop, parigot!

15:41.167 --> 15:42.167
Listen,

15:42.500 --> 15:46.667

of your business and it will be fine.

15:47.250 --> 15:47.917

15:51.667 --> 15:53.417

- How's my little cat?

15:58.167 --> 16:00.084

It's okay?

16:05.000 --> 16:06.042
Sigh

16:09.375 --> 16:10.000
OK.

16:10.167 --> 16:12.500
It's good, I'll surprise you.

16:14.209 --> 16:17.792
Oh no, my bag!
Oh, really!

16:19.917 --> 16:21.959
Rhythmic music

Moaning effort

16:50.042 --> 16:51.292
He screams.

16:51.459 --> 16:52.542
Distant shock

16:54.334 --> 16:56.709
Someone there? Oh fuck!

16:56.875 --> 16:57.625

17:12.500 --> 17:15.416
Ah, here it is! Great... great day.

17:21.959 --> 17:22.750
Yes.

You'll be served.

17:26.125 --> 17:27.666
Are we putting Beethoven?

17:28.334 --> 17:28.959
What?

17:30.209 --> 17:32.500
We're not going to
put a movie on dogs.

17:32.667 --> 17:34.459
It sucks. I manage

17:58.584 --> 17:59.834
He did it

18:00.000 --> 18:02.084
by a great painter.
- Okay.

18:03.584 --> 18:04.417
And the statue?

18:04.917 --> 18:05.625
Dad.

18:05.792 --> 18:06.625
It's dad.

Turn it off.

19:55.667 --> 19:57.917
only in the game <i>EA</i> Sport.

Eh, Bichon?

20:35.542 --> 20:36.584
Yes.
- Field.

20:36.750 --> 20:39.417
Attention, the time is more than serious.

20:39.584 --> 20:42.250
We have a severe problem.

20:42.417 --> 20:44.709
It's more the niaks, it's
more the Santa Claus,

20:44.875 --> 20:47.167
it's more the chleus, it's
even more the Belgians.

20:47.334 --> 20:48.459
It's more serious.

20:48.625 --> 20:49.292
High-pitched scream

It speaks to you?

Yes! It's a gang of robbers

21:16.459 --> 21:19.625
who made five jewelry
stores in one month.

21:19.792 --> 21:22.875
They started again this morning.
- Bichon, the device.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.875
It is forbidden to ridicule oneself.

21:36.042 --> 21:40.084
You will start the spinning
mills and find eyewitnesses

21:40.750 --> 21:42.459
who heard everything.

21:43.667 --> 21:44.625
Have you read?

21:46.459 --> 21:47.584
Something else,

21:47.750 --> 21:50.375
my polls are not brilliant,

21:50.542 --> 21:51.084
huh?

21:51.250 --> 21:53.292
The national police must not

21:53.459 --> 21:57.334
we walk in front of the feet.
It's for the Mumu

21:57.500 --> 21:58.334
from Marseille.

21:58.500 --> 21:59.709
I made myself understood?

21:59.875 --> 22:00.667
HE CHEF!

22:00.834 --> 22:02.000
I named

22:08.542 --> 22:10.917
Sir?
You speak Italian?

22:11.459 --> 22:12.375
No why?

22:12.542 --> 22:15.125
You must change your name.
- Yes.

22:15.292 --> 22:17.792
No, I liked that...

I found.

22:23.792 --> 22:27.292
I named this operation,
the operation...

22:28.292 --> 22:29.334
Mafia!

22:29.500 --> 22:30.459
The Mayor,

22:30.625 --> 22:32.042
we do not have the equipment.

22:32.459 --> 22:33.084
Huh?

22:33.250 --> 22:34.167
We are too few.

22:34.334 --> 22:37.292
And Charles Martel, in
front of all the Arabs,

22:37.459 --> 22:38.792
he was alone!

22:38.959 --> 22:40.125
We can not do less.

22:40.292 --> 22:43.875
And we have a great cop.
Where is the super cop?

22:44.042 --> 22:46.500
I am here, Mr. Mayor.
- Quentin!

22:46.667 --> 22:48.042
Sylvain.
- Miro?

22:48.209 --> 22:49.917
Marot, but...

22:50.084 --> 22:50.875
Go up.

22:51.042 --> 22:52.084
Ah yes?

22:54.042 --> 22:55.000
Marin will be

22:55.167 --> 22:56.167
your leader.

22:56.334 --> 22:58.500
He will put his expertise to work

22:58.667 --> 23:00.417

23:00.584 --> 23:04.250
Yes, but know that I'm
only passing through here,

23:04.417 --> 23:06.625
because I intend to integrate the RAID.

23:06.792 --> 23:07.542
Sigh

23:08.250 --> 23:10.750
But if you want to get out of here,

23:10.917 --> 23:13.042
it will have to torch this mission.

23:13.209 --> 23:13.834
Ah yes?

23:14.000 --> 23:14.917
Eh yes.

23:15.667 --> 23:16.334
Good,

23:49.500 --> 23:51.459
Ah.
- You see that you like yourself

23:51.625 --> 23:52.500
with us!

23:54.334 --> 23:57.792
The faster you catch the
Italians, the sooner I get home.

23:57.959 --> 24:00.750
Yeah, I understand. Ah yes...

24:00.917 --> 24:02.625
What do you find?

24:02.792 --> 24:05.375
A Ferrari by steering
that we do not find.

24:05.959 --> 24:09.500
Only big cars:
Ferrari California, 458...

24:10.125 --> 24:12.375
With the Dacia, it's going to be hard!

24:12.542 --> 24:13.084
Oh?

24:13.250 --> 24:14.209
You think?

24:17.375 --> 24:21.875
It is certain that with Daniel and
Emilien, it would have been different.

24:22.834 --> 24:23.500
Who is that?

24:24.042 --> 24:26.750
Daniel and Emilien.
- I do not know.

24:26.917 --> 24:29.709
Do not you know Daniel and Emilien?

24:29.875 --> 24:30.750
No, sorry.

24:30.917 --> 24:33.042
Even in Paris, they are known.

24:33.209 --> 24:35.834
Uh... The Mercedes gang.

24:36.292 --> 24:36.959
<i>You mm?</i>

24:38.709 --> 24:39.917
Robberies,

24:40.084 --> 24:41.792
late 90s?
- Yes.

24:41.959 --> 24:44.250
Daniel and Emilien arrested them.

24:44.417 --> 24:45.417
Here!

24:45.584 --> 24:49.042
Same for the... Ah! If you know...

24:49.209 --> 24:51.000
The Japaneses. The same.

24:51.167 --> 24:51.875
And

24:52.042 --> 24:53.667
the fathers, the Belgians,

24:53.834 --> 24:56.875
Daniel and Emilien! Emilien, big cop.

24:57.042 --> 24:58.084
It was there!

24:58.250 --> 25:00.250
I had trouble following.
- Well then!

25:00.417 --> 25:02.917
And Daniel. Daniel, what a pilot!

25:03.084 --> 25:04.125
M u

25:04.292 --> 25:06.709
what he wanted from his taxi.

25:06.875 --> 25:08.834
It was a rocket, a racing car.

25:10.292 --> 25:13.834
We did not even see him go by.
There was a plaque coming out

25:14.000 --> 25:15.167
from [lia to m

25:15.334 --> 25:16.959
with buttons.

25:17.125 --> 25:17.834
And there,

25:18.000 --> 25:19.792
the taxi rose from the ground.

25:22.125 --> 25:22.709
He was transforming himself.

25:22.875 --> 25:25.500
He imitates mechanical noises.

25:27.959 --> 25:30.584
New plate for the... Good.

25:30.750 --> 25:31.709
[g Mg

25:31.875 --> 25:32.875
Go Om!

25:33.042 --> 25:36.375
The taxi that it was!
When he left, he tore

25:36.542 --> 25:38.250
dg <i>?</i> @ mm @ on me mm

25:38.417 --> 25:39.959

25:40.125 --> 25:41.209
Huh?
- Including.

25:41.375 --> 25:42.459
You did not understand.

25:42.625 --> 25:45.834
He burned all the radars.
They were falling

25:46.000 --> 25:47.417
when he passed.

25:47.584 --> 25:52.292
<i>Um?amefihiah A aumhahu</i>

25:52.459 --> 25:53.167
How?

25:55.375 --> 25:56.125
By the airs.

25:56.292 --> 25:59.792
They were parachuted
by a military plane

25:59.959 --> 26:01.500
of Daniel's father-in-law.

26:01.667 --> 26:03.084
And in the air,

26:03.959 --> 26:05.042
the taxi was floating.

26:05.209 --> 26:07.209
I swear! I was told.

26:07.375 --> 26:08.167
He released

26:08.334 --> 26:10.250
wings.
- Wings?

26:10.417 --> 26:11.834
Wings.
- No.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.209
I swear to you

26:13.375 --> 26:14.375
on Gfi?m

26:14.542 --> 26:15.209
Listen!

26:15.375 --> 26:16.250
Sorry.

26:17.209 --> 26:18.917
Where is this taxi?

26:20.834 --> 26:25.334
As Emilien is no longer in the
police and Daniel lives in Miami,

26:25.792 --> 26:27.000
I dunno.

26:28.375 --> 26:32.084
Maybe by asking
Daniel's grand-nephew.

26:32.250 --> 26:34.667
It must be his
nephew by marriage,

26:34.834 --> 26:36.792
he is a little weird.

26:36.959 --> 26:40.125
At the same time, there is
only the taxi that interests me.

26:40.292 --> 26:43.334
Well yeah. We must find this taxi.

26:43.500 --> 26:45.875
And with this taxi, I'm
catching the Italians.

26:46.042 --> 26:48.542
Italians, Scots, everyone.

26:50.417 --> 26:51.959
<i>Ah m?ns m</i>

26:52.125 --> 26:53.834
That is true?
- Yes.

26:54.000 --> 26:58.584
I think Daniel and
Emilien, it is outdated.

26:58.750 --> 27:02.959
It's like Starsky and Hutch,
Ball and Bill, Olive and Tom,

27:03.125 --> 27:04.459
It's over.

27:04.959 --> 27:07.250
Because now it's treasure

27:07.584 --> 27:09.584
and Marot!
- It sounds good.

27:09.750 --> 27:11.667
He's laughing.
I would not have left

27:11.834 --> 27:12.584
alone.

27:13.000 --> 27:16.000
You're not alone anymore.
I'm here for you.

27:16.167 --> 27:20.084
You're here for me, huh?
- Thank you for being there for me.

27:20.250 --> 27:20.875
You're welcome.

27:21.042 --> 27:23.459
It would have been hard without you.
- It's clear.

27:23.625 --> 27:25.459
And now, we are two.

27:25.625 --> 27:27.500
Yes.
- We are stronger.

27:27.667 --> 27:29.042
Nothing will happen to us.

27:29.209 --> 27:30.167
Nothing at all.

27:30.334 --> 27:31.584
What will happen to us?
- Nothing!

27:31.750 --> 27:32.459
Cry of pain

27:36.459 --> 27:37.834
Electrocardiogram beeps

27:38.000 --> 27:41.500
No, but it's nothing,
tomorrow I'm up.

27:42.542 --> 27:43.625
We will investigate.

27:43.792 --> 27:45.125
Yes.
- Alain and Sylvain,

27:45.292 --> 27:46.500
the 2 fingers of the hand.

27:46.667 --> 27:48.584
Take it, yes.
He moans.

27:51.292 --> 27:52.375
Rest.

27:53.042 --> 27:53.917
It hurts.

27:54.084 --> 27:55.209
Someone knocked.

27:56.834 --> 27:58.000
'It's okay?

27:58.167 --> 28:00.584
We know who overthrew you.

28:00.750 --> 28:03.750
We have the identity of
Daniel's grand-nephew.

28:07.500 --> 28:09.000
OK, you have

28:09.167 --> 28:10.792
his name?
- EDDY MAKLOUF.

28:12.500 --> 28:13.250
A namesake.

28:13.750 --> 28:17.167
Yeah.
- Do they live at the same address?

28:18.125 --> 28:20.125
That would be pretty amazing.

28:20.292 --> 28:21.417
You are stupid,

28:21.584 --> 28:25.459
it's the same person!
- I like when you talk badly.

28:25.875 --> 28:26.834
Go away.

28:30.500 --> 28:31.250
It's okay.

It burns.

29:07.459 --> 29:08.459
It stings!

29:08.625 --> 29:09.750
Sir, why

29:09.917 --> 29:10.875
did that?

29:11.042 --> 29:12.209
He was aggressive.

29:12.375 --> 29:14.042
Ouch! It burns me!

29:14.209 --> 29:15.250
It stings!

29:32.042 --> 29:33.084
Neither do I.

29:33.250 --> 29:35.167
I'm close to burnout.
- Ah?

29:35.875 --> 29:37.834
In addition, my girl threw me.

29:38.292 --> 29:42.084
That's good, you're going
to rest at Les Baumettes.

29:42.625 --> 29:43.375
Yes.

29:49.084 --> 29:50.042
I have a deal.

29:54.542 --> 29:57.459
You find me the taxi and
I forget everything.

29:58.500 --> 30:02.042
It's not bad, is it?
- Yes... But I can not.

30:02.209 --> 30:03.209
The taxi,

30:03.375 --> 30:06.209
we sent it to... at the bled.

30:07.250 --> 30:09.834
Back home?
- He had 200000 on the counter,

30:10.000 --> 30:11.750
we sent him to my uncle.

30:14.125 --> 30:16.250
I can offer you

30:16.417 --> 30:19.000
a deal too?
- At the point where I am.

30:20.292 --> 30:24.167
If I find you,
we could team up.

30:24.334 --> 30:27.959
As in Bad Boy, you'll be Will
Smith and I, Martin Lawrence.

30:28.125 --> 30:31.209
We will not team together, no.
- No?

30:31.375 --> 30:32.750
No.
- Pity.

30:32.917 --> 30:35.000
I could have found these Italians.

30:38.459 --> 30:39.209
What?

30:39.375 --> 30:43.417
I know everyone here, I
could have helped you.

30:43.584 --> 30:45.917
I could have asked my friends Uber.

30:46.834 --> 30:49.584
But apparently, it's not possible.

30:54.042 --> 30:55.750
Without disrespecting,

30:56.500 --> 30:59.667
your team there is
a little Cotorep?

31:00.917 --> 31:02.667
So that, not at all.

31:02.834 --> 31:03.875

My uncle, it's a legend.

That's the brake...

34:42.042 --> 34:45.125
Put a wiper's blow already.
- Yes.

34:46.042 --> 34:47.917
It's the turn signals.
- I know.

34:49.417 --> 34:50.500

34:57.250 --> 34:57.917
What?

35:02.209 --> 35:03.375
You know who I am?

35:04.459 --> 35:09.084
I am Eddy Maklouf, the nephew
of Daniel, a living legend.

35:09.250 --> 35:13.500
Piloting is in the genes.
So yes, I can fly it.

35:15.334 --> 35:17.542
Let's go.
- No, let's go, OK?

35:17.959 --> 35:21.417

did not hear anything.

35:37.292 --> 35:38.250
You stalled.

35:38.417 --> 35:39.042
No!

35:39.209 --> 35:40.042
Oh yes!

35:40.209 --> 35:43.709
It's the centrifugal force
that propels us forward.

35:43.875 --> 35:46.542
Genes have skipped a generation?

35:46.709 --> 35:49.334
You stress me, I concentrate badly.

35:49.500 --> 35:50.459

35:51.625 --> 35:52.542
Your permit.

35:52.709 --> 35:54.917

36:01.250 --> 36:04.334
It's a manual, I do not
know how to drive it.

36:04.500 --> 36:07.750
The pedal on the left is used for what?
- It's a clutch.

36:08.334 --> 36:10.042
Yes.
- You do not know how to drive.

36:11.167 --> 36:11.875

47:46.792 --> 47:48.167
I'm crazy outside.

47:48.334 --> 47:52.459
She answers me more.
I do not know what smiley to send him.

47:52.625 --> 47:54.084
Either smiley

47:54.250 --> 47:56.584
"It does not matter", you know?

47:56.750 --> 47:59.500
The one who is like that.
Or the raging smiley.

47:59.667 --> 48:01.125
The one with the mouth.

48:01.750 --> 48:02.792
"You left me".

48:02.959 --> 48:05.584
I hesitate.
Too bad there is not a smiley

48:05.750 --> 48:07.042
Algerian, something like that.

48:10.292 --> 48:11.584
And you would have the same

48:11.750 --> 48:15.042
for girls in blow drying.
What do you think?

48:15.209 --> 48:16.709
You ask me?

48:16.875 --> 48:17.542
Yes.

48:17.709 --> 48:20.500
It's been 2 hours that
you talk about your gadgi.

48:20.667 --> 48:23.042
I'm going crazy. Rene!

48:23.209 --> 48:25.125
Yeah?
- Give me some ice cubes.

48:25.292 --> 48:26.417
2 minutes, I arrive.

48:27.959 --> 48:29.459
Sylvain, here is Baba,

48:29.625 --> 48:30.709
my best friend.

48:30.875 --> 48:33.042
Finally, I thought.
- Are you serious?

48:33.209 --> 48:33.917
Yes.

48:35.250 --> 48:38.417
I give you the relay, I
can not anymore. Good luck.

48:38.584 --> 48:39.375
On my mother.

48:39.542 --> 48:40.917
Hi Baba, thanks.

48:41.875 --> 48:44.542
Thank you, brother.
- You're exhausting all your friends.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.375
This is the Uber HQ?

48:50.292 --> 48:51.084
What?

48:51.750 --> 48:53.875
It's my girl. My ex-girl.

48:54.375 --> 48:55.500
I had to see her,

48:55.667 --> 48:57.125
but she has an evening.

48:58.417 --> 48:59.834
She is too beautiful for me.

49:00.000 --> 49:03.500
Usually, the girls I'm
interested in are nuts.

49:03.667 --> 49:06.761
Seen like that. Your
sister comes often...

49:06.773 --> 49:08.292
And there, for once

49:08.459 --> 49:12.875
that a pretty, intelligent girl is
interested in me, what do I do?

49:13.042 --> 49:16.584
I'm at home talking about games.
- That's stupid.

49:16.750 --> 49:17.584
Your sister...
- That's stupid?

49:18.000 --> 49:21.667
Do you have that to cheer me up?
- It's an expression.

49:21.834 --> 49:22.792
Your sister is coming...

49:22.959 --> 49:24.792
And for the Italians?

49:29.375 --> 49:31.167
Must infiltrate the environment.

49:31.334 --> 49:32.667
Do you have tracks?

49:35.542 --> 49:38.334
The only Italian
I know is Rachid.

49:40.375 --> 49:43.000
But he's from father and mother...

49:43.167 --> 49:46.209
He is from Italy?
- It is of parents in galley,

49:46.375 --> 49:48.667
but he is not Italian, he is...

49:50.625 --> 49:53.334
Okay.
- But here is an Italian.

49:53.500 --> 49:54.709
There he is from here.

49:54.875 --> 49:57.292
I do not know if you...
- Yes it's...

49:57.459 --> 49:59.792
Rachid, it's not Italian.
- No.

49:59.959 --> 50:02.375
He has a jersey from Italy,

50:02.542 --> 50:04.000
from Del Piero, but...

50:04.167 --> 50:05.750
<i>aP?famr. fia mm</i>

50:06.209 --> 50:07.834
<i>Y m!</i>

50:08.000 --> 50:09.209
He sings.

50:12.875 --> 50:14.667
<i>a y</i>

50:15.334 --> 50:18.084
<i>Vm MM y m?e</i>

50:18.250 --> 50:18.959
Rachid!

50:19.125 --> 50:20.375
Senorita.
- Rachid.

50:25.417 --> 50:26.500
It's a bomb.

50:27.459 --> 50:30.709
"How many times have I told
you not to call me Rachid?

50:30.875 --> 50:34.834
What do you see on the tables?
Couscous, tajine?

50:35.000 --> 50:36.417
No, it's pizza!

50:36.584 --> 50:38.834
My name is Ricardo, shit!

50:40.250 --> 50:41.625
Who is it?
- Huh?

50:41.792 --> 50:45.584
Who is it?
- Ra... Ricardo, my friend Sylvain

50:45.750 --> 50:48.334
of the police.
- Oh!

50:52.834 --> 50:56.084
For everyone she was
major, it's not just me.

50:56.250 --> 50:59.542
No no not at all.
- She's 40 years old.

50:59.709 --> 51:01.250
Not at all, hush.

51:01.417 --> 51:04.834
No no.
- OK, I understood, I understood.

51:05.917 --> 51:07.000
I understood.

51:07.167 --> 51:09.250
I know why you are here.
- No.

51:09.417 --> 51:11.000
Yes, I know, I know.

51:11.167 --> 51:12.209
OK...

51:12.375 --> 51:13.667
Come with me.

51:14.292 --> 51:15.125
No!

51:15.292 --> 51:16.792
It's not at all that.

51:19.959 --> 51:22.125
Place your bets.
Burst the bank.

51:22.709 --> 51:23.750
Interesting.

51:26.000 --> 51:27.792
We did not come for that.

51:27.959 --> 51:29.584
14. Unbelievable.

51:32.292 --> 51:34.334
Why?
- Not for that.

51:34.500 --> 51:35.459
Oh fuck...

51:36.875 --> 51:37.542
Here.

51:39.209 --> 51:40.375
Useless to say

51:40.542 --> 51:42.125
What is my collection?

51:43.542 --> 51:45.584
Crazy stuff, it's lrak here.

51:48.250 --> 51:51.042
Tell me what you know
about the Italians.

51:52.209 --> 51:54.542
What Italians are you talking about?

51:54.709 --> 51:56.500
Eddy, put that down, mess!

51:56.667 --> 51:57.917
OK sorry.

51:58.542 --> 51:59.875
Stealers,

52:00.042 --> 52:02.459
did you see them?
- It'll fall back on me,

52:02.625 --> 52:04.250
so I saw nobody.

52:04.417 --> 52:05.667
Can I shoot with?

52:05.834 --> 52:06.834
Do not touch!

52:07.000 --> 52:08.792
It's not true!
- OK!

52:08.959 --> 52:09.792
Okay.

52:11.792 --> 52:14.542
What if I invited the cops here?
- Oh!

52:14.709 --> 52:17.167
Have you seen them?
- They came to eat.

52:17.334 --> 52:18.209
Pasta.

52:18.375 --> 52:20.542
No, no Italian comes to eat

52:20.709 --> 52:24.875
in your restaurant. You sold them weapons?
Yes or no?

52:25.042 --> 52:26.875
Yes. No. A little.

52:27.042 --> 52:27.792
Which ones?

52:28.417 --> 52:32.000
Small... Steps...
Inoffensive weapons...

52:32.167 --> 52:34.750
Really very very harmless.

52:36.542 --> 52:38.542
Oh no, here, there, there.

52:39.000 --> 52:42.084
What is happening?
- What's behind?

52:42.250 --> 52:44.125
Where?
- Behind the wall.

52:44.292 --> 52:45.459
Reggae Music

52:50.375 --> 52:51.042
Wow!

52:51.209 --> 52:55.834
Did you see that? The neighbor,
behind my house, I had not seen.

52:56.292 --> 52:57.875
It's for my restaurant.

52:58.042 --> 52:59.292
Okay.
- Yes!

52:59.459 --> 53:03.959
We need herbs, so it's
like aromatic herbs.

53:04.125 --> 53:06.542
Rosemary, thyme and emmental.

53:06.709 --> 53:07.792
And a little...?

53:09.292 --> 53:10.042
Weed.

53:10.792 --> 53:11.917
Hold on!

53:12.084 --> 53:13.709
I make salads!

53:13.875 --> 53:18.250
The ritals are gone with the weapons?
- I delivered them.

53:18.417 --> 53:20.084
Or?
- At the end of the world.

53:21.459 --> 53:26.042
A circuit in Vauvenargues.
- We hold them. It's not the robbers,

53:26.209 --> 53:27.250
it's pilots.

53:27.417 --> 53:28.125
So what?

53:30.042 --> 53:31.584
I know the drivers.

53:33.667 --> 53:36.917
He can leave my grass of Provence?

53:37.084 --> 53:39.417
She's up to everyone.
- It's mine.

53:39.584 --> 53:41.125
No.
- Put it down.

53:41.292 --> 53:43.584
You're badly placed.
- Put my basilisk.

53:58.125 --> 54:00.042

Sylvain.

54:10.209 --> 54:11.375
Call your sister.

54:11.792 --> 54:13.125

- Yes!

That's the taxi guy.

54:35.084 --> 54:37.542

- No sorry.

54:38.625 --> 54:39.500
She hung up?

54:39.667 --> 54:41.292
It's all her.
- Remember.

54:41.459 --> 54:42.709
What?
- Recall it.

54:44.625 --> 54:45.459
Yeah?

54:45.625 --> 54:46.459
It's Sylvain

54:46.625 --> 54:47.750
<i>* the municipal police.</i>

54:47.917 --> 54:51.834
I am on a circuit. I have to teach
a lesson to two Italian girls.

54:52.000 --> 54:53.834
OK. You go in set-up,

54:54.000 --> 54:55.375
<i>* put yourself in race mode.</i>

54:55.542 --> 54:58.000
No, you're not going to race or set-up.

54:58.167 --> 54:59.375
Everything is fine.

54:59.542 --> 55:00.792
Increases to 1.3 bars

55:00.959 --> 55:04.584
<i>* and adjusts the braking distribution
65 at the front, 35 at the rear</i>

55:04.750 --> 55:06.084
and press the pedal.

55:06.542 --> 55:07.417
That's good.

55:17.250 --> 55:18.375
It's better.

55:18.542 --> 55:20.875
<i>* We make a nice team.
- No.</i>

55:21.042 --> 55:22.375
I'll call you back.

55:22.542 --> 55:23.834
Do not feel obligated.

55:25.417 --> 55:26.500
She is hard.

55:26.667 --> 55:27.584
Are you ready?

55:27.750 --> 55:30.292
Engine

55:31.250 --> 55:31.959
Go!

55:32.125 --> 55:33.709
Stop Please!

55:34.417 --> 55:35.542
Shout

55:38.917 --> 55:39.792
No!

55:39.959 --> 55:40.709
Its good!

55:40.875 --> 55:42.042
Yeah!

55:45.167 --> 55:46.834
It's fragile Italian,

55:47.000 --> 55:48.250
but to roll like that,

55:48.417 --> 55:50.209
you will not break them!

55:53.584 --> 55:55.792
It's forbidden here. What do you want?

55:55.959 --> 55:58.584
The stroke of the tram, it pissed me off.

55:58.750 --> 55:59.375
I wanted

55:59.542 --> 56:02.584
to train, without knowing
that you were running.

56:03.042 --> 56:06.084
We wondered: the red is pretty,

56:06.250 --> 56:08.834
but she has the engine of a Fiat 500?

56:09.625 --> 56:11.250
That's his wife's.

56:11.417 --> 56:14.417
Ah yes.
- Hair, you need something powerful.

56:15.084 --> 56:16.084
Rocco.

56:26.625 --> 56:28.000
You are arrogant.

56:35.000 --> 56:36.167
But you are a good pilot.

56:36.750 --> 56:38.542
I'm having an evening tomorrow.

56:38.709 --> 56:42.417
If you want to make money, come on.
I will introduce you to people.

56:44.834 --> 56:46.375
Yes, if I go through there.

56:46.709 --> 56:47.834
Taxi drivers,

56:48.000 --> 56:49.959
they are good race drivers.

56:52.292 --> 56:55.792
In relation to the
clientele, they go shopping.

57:00.042 --> 57:01.375
He does not come.

57:05.917 --> 57:06.959
There you go.

57:07.584 --> 57:10.709
Why him, he's not coming? Why?

57:12.084 --> 57:13.167
He is coming!

57:13.334 --> 57:14.292
Strong acceleration

57:22.875 --> 57:23.792
You're beating all the time.

57:23.959 --> 57:24.792
You never.

57:24.959 --> 57:26.584
It happens to me. Here,

57:26.750 --> 57:28.584
flowers.
- What do I do?

57:29.917 --> 57:31.209
Put them in a vase.

57:32.125 --> 57:32.792
Thank you.

57:32.959 --> 57:34.667
Usually, it's nice.

57:37.500 --> 57:39.167
I had a surprise but...

57:39.709 --> 57:43.334
I feel that I do not like you.
Sorry for inconvenience.

57:44.792 --> 57:45.834
I did not say that.

57:47.750 --> 57:49.000
Soft music

57:54.459 --> 57:58.875
Explain to me, I am a good pilot but
you, you are not a model of series.

57:59.042 --> 58:02.542
You must be a prototype, I do
not have the technical sheet...

58:02.709 --> 58:04.667
There are lights that come on,

58:04.834 --> 58:07.167
but I do not know what it is.

58:07.334 --> 58:10.584
If I see nothing, maybe there
is more windshield washer...

58:11.125 --> 58:13.542
I understood. You've finished?

58:14.084 --> 58:14.750
Yes.

58:15.792 --> 58:17.125
I'm going to get ready.

58:25.125 --> 58:26.542
This technique works

58:26.709 --> 58:28.125
so?
- Not get excited!

58:32.917 --> 58:33.667
Warning.

58:34.417 --> 58:35.542
There you go!

58:36.250 --> 58:38.750
Are you sure of yourself?
I do not like surprises.

58:40.000 --> 58:40.792
This one,

58:41.750 --> 58:43.459
you will never forget it.

58:43.709 --> 58:45.125
It's okay?
- Well yeah.

It's not here, the dolphins.
We will go

59:21.625 --> 59:23.959
in the other basin, there.

59:24.125 --> 59:25.084
Not with me.

59:29.209 --> 59:30.834
It's just water!

They are beautiful.

Thank you. As I had the

He's laughing.

Eddy laughs too.

01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:19.750

we'll jump out the window.

01:12:22.292 --> 01:12:23.917
We're going to fuck our breeds.

01:12:24.542 --> 01:12:26.750
Are you completely stupid or
are you doing it on purpose?

01:12:26.917 --> 01:12:27.917
No!

01:12:28.709 --> 01:12:30.917
You're completely stupid.
If we stay there, we're dead.

01:12:31.542 --> 01:12:34.625
At 3, we jump out the window.
Are you with me?

01:12:36.709 --> 01:12:38.042
Are you ready?
- Yes!

01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:39.250

01:12:41.834 --> 01:12:44.084
Come on, one, two...

- You did not understand.

In any case,

01:13:24.667 --> 01:13:27.542

We will not be up to it.

You need real cops.

01:14:42.959 --> 01:14:43.750

01:14:43.917 --> 01:14:46.209
It's because he's happy.

It was I who organized

I mobilized the finest teams.

There is a round.

It looks like a "brone".
It's a "brone".

I'll protect her.
Do not touch his pistil.

Come.

What?
- I do not feel it too much.

No, but come!

Bravo.

01:35:01.917 --> 01:35:03.292
From the mayor.

01:35:03.459 --> 01:35:04.292
Thank you.

01:35:07.334 --> 01:35:08.750
The city thanks you.

01:35:13.167 --> 01:35:15.625
Marseille thanks you.

01:35:15.792 --> 01:35:16.584
Oh!

01:35:18.584 --> 01:35:20.167
We thank you.

01:35:30.667 --> 01:35:31.500
I love you!

01:35:32.042 --> 01:35:33.042
I love you fucking.

01:35:52.375 --> 01:35:55.750
humming

01:36:09.834 --> 01:36:13.125
I'm proud of you.
It's okay with your darling.

01:36:13.292 --> 01:36:15.750
Great.
Look what I'm going to offer him.

01:36:24.417 --> 01:36:26.209
Did you steal it?
- No.

01:36:26.375 --> 01:36:28.334
Yes, to the Italians.
- No.

01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:31.542
And even!
I stole a stolen ring,

01:36:31.709 --> 01:36:33.209
it vanishes.

01:36:35.042 --> 01:36:36.125
So, we do

01:36:36.292 --> 01:36:37.292
his request?

01:36:39.334 --> 01:36:40.209
Where are you going?

01:36:40.375 --> 01:36:42.750
I have to be at the
airport in 25 minutes.

01:36:42.917 --> 01:36:44.209
25 minutes, it's wide.

01:36:44.375 --> 01:36:45.667
No, 25 minutes,

01:36:45.834 --> 01:36:47.125
it's impossible.

01:36:48.084 --> 01:36:49.459
I have a snack

01:36:49.625 --> 01:36:52.459

There are four quarters,

01:36:52.625 --> 01:36:53.625

01:36:53.792 --> 01:36:55.459
Rhythmic song

01:36:55.625 --> 01:36:56.917
humming
