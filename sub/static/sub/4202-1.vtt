04:32.910 --> 04:35.710
<i>Next subject: Kowalski, Leon.</i>

04:36.080 --> 04:38.040
<i>Engineer, waste disposal.</i>

04:38.250 --> 04:41.550
<i>File section: New employee, six days.</i>

04:42.340 --> 04:43.920
<i>Calling Mr. Webber...</i>

04:44.090 --> 04:46.930
<i>- Come in.
- ...please report to Zone A Sector 9.</i>

04:50.510 --> 04:54.890
<i>Replication Center Level 9,
we have a B1 security alert.</i>

04:55.060 --> 04:57.690
<i>Stand by for ID check, please.</i>

04:58.270 --> 04:59.360
Sit down.

04:59.940 --> 05:03.150
<i>Replication Center Level 9,
we have a B1 security alert.</i>

05:03.320 --> 05:04.360
<i>Stand by for....</i>

05:04.530 --> 05:05.780
Care if I talk?

05:06.280 --> 05:08.160
I'm kind of nervous when I take tests.

05:08.320 --> 05:10.160
Just please don't move.

05:11.290 --> 05:12.950
Oh, sorry.

05:16.330 --> 05:19.340
I already had an IQ test.
I don't think I've had one of these.

05:19.500 --> 05:21.750
Reaction time is a factor,
so pay attention.

05:21.920 --> 05:24.510
Now answer as quickly as you can.

05:25.010 --> 05:26.470
Sure.

05:27.470 --> 05:29.140
1187 at Hunterwasser.

05:29.300 --> 05:30.350
That's the hotel.

05:30.510 --> 05:32.640
- What?
- Where I live.

05:32.810 --> 05:34.520
- Nice place?
- Yeah, sure, I guess.

05:34.680 --> 05:36.350
Is that part of the test?

05:36.520 --> 05:39.230
No. Just warming you up. That's all.

05:40.110 --> 05:42.400
It's not fancy or anything.

05:43.530 --> 05:46.110
You're in a desert,
walking along in the sand, when--

05:46.280 --> 05:47.320
Is this the test, now?

05:47.490 --> 05:49.990
Yes. You're in a desert,
walking along in the sand...

05:50.160 --> 05:51.910
-  ...when you look down--
- What one?

05:52.080 --> 05:53.830
- What?
- What desert?

05:53.990 --> 05:56.790
Doesn't make any difference.
It's completely hypothetical.

05:56.960 --> 05:59.290
- But how come I'd be there?
- Maybe you're fed up.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.790
Maybe you wanna be by yourself.
Who knows?

06:02.460 --> 06:04.090
You look down and see a tortoise.

06:04.250 --> 06:07.880
- It's crawling towards you--
- Tortoise? What's that?

06:10.970 --> 06:13.350
- You know what a turtle is?
- Of course.

06:13.510 --> 06:15.100
Same thing.

06:15.270 --> 06:16.890
I've never seen a turtle.

06:19.520 --> 06:21.020
But I understand what you mean.

06:21.190 --> 06:23.900
You reach down,
you flip the tortoise over on its back.

06:24.070 --> 06:26.440
Do you make up these questions,
Mr. Holden?

06:26.610 --> 06:28.740
Or do they write them down for you?

06:28.900 --> 06:31.820
The tortoise lays on its back,
its belly baking in the sun...

06:31.990 --> 06:35.080
...beating its legs,
trying to turn itself over, but it can't...

06:35.240 --> 06:36.750
...not without your help.

06:36.910 --> 06:39.160
- You're not helping.
- What do you mean I'm not?

06:39.330 --> 06:40.670
I mean, you're not helping.

06:41.210 --> 06:42.250
Why is that, Leon?

06:50.930 --> 06:53.430
They're just questions, Leon.

06:54.050 --> 06:56.970
In answer to your query,
they're written down for me.

06:57.140 --> 07:01.440
It's a test designed to provoke
an emotional response.

07:03.940 --> 07:05.980
Shall we continue?

07:07.150 --> 07:10.950
Describe in single words only the
good things that come into your mind...

07:11.660 --> 07:13.320
...about your mother.

07:13.490 --> 07:16.040
- My mother?
- Yeah.

07:17.240 --> 07:19.750
Let me tell you about my mother.

07:35.600 --> 07:39.600
<i>A new life awaits you
in the Off-world colonies.</i>

07:39.980 --> 07:41.850
<i>The chance to begin again...</i>

07:42.020 --> 07:46.070
<i>...in a golden land of opportunity
and adventure.</i>

08:11.920 --> 08:16.140
<i>A new life awaits you
in the Off-world colonies.</i>

08:16.300 --> 08:18.310
<i>The chance to begin again...</i>

08:18.470 --> 08:22.100
<i>...in a golden land of opportunity
and adventure.</i>

08:25.690 --> 08:29.360
<i>The custom-tailored, genetically
engineered humanoid Replicant...</i>

08:29.530 --> 08:32.780
<i>...designed especially for your needs.</i>

08:32.950 --> 08:36.780
<i>So come on, America.
Let's put out....</i>

08:38.409 --> 08:40.120
Give me four.

08:41.870 --> 08:43.909
No, four. Two, two. Four.

08:47.630 --> 08:48.840
And noodles.

09:02.470 --> 09:03.770
Hey.

09:12.150 --> 09:14.700
He say you under arrest, Mr. Deckard.

09:15.650 --> 09:17.110
Got the wrong guy, pal.

09:22.700 --> 09:24.160
He say you Blade Runner.

09:24.330 --> 09:25.790
Tell him I'm eating.

09:25.960 --> 09:27.170
Captain Bryant... .

09:30.920 --> 09:32.380
Bryant, huh?

09:47.770 --> 09:49.860
<i>Yellow 3.</i>

09:50.020 --> 09:52.730
<i>Climb and maintain 4000.</i>

10:55.090 --> 10:57.210
<i>Final descent.</i>

10:57.380 --> 11:00.340
<i>Now on glide path. Mark course.</i>

11:00.510 --> 11:02.550
<i>Over the landing threshold.</i>

11:21.240 --> 11:22.280
Hiya, Deck.

11:22.450 --> 11:23.740
Bryant.

11:23.910 --> 11:27.200
You wouldn't have come
if I just asked you to. Sit down, pal.

11:28.620 --> 11:33.000
Come on, don't be an asshole, Deckard.
I've got four skin-jobs walking the streets.

11:49.310 --> 11:52.390
They jumped a shuttle Off-world,
killed the crew and passengers.

11:52.560 --> 11:55.610
They found the shuttle drifting
off the coast two weeks ago...

11:55.770 --> 11:57.690
...so we know they're around.

11:59.070 --> 12:00.240
Embarrassing.

12:00.400 --> 12:03.950
No, sir, not embarrassing. No one's ever
gonna find out they're down here.

12:04.110 --> 12:06.660
Because you're gonna spot them
and air them out.

12:06.830 --> 12:08.120
I don't work here anymore.

12:09.500 --> 12:10.540
Give it to Holden.

12:11.080 --> 12:13.040
- He's good.
- I did.

12:13.210 --> 12:15.710
He can breathe okay
as long as nobody unplugs him.

12:16.590 --> 12:19.800
He's not good enough.
Not good as you.

12:19.960 --> 12:21.550
I need you, Deck.

12:21.720 --> 12:24.090
Now, this is a bad one, the worst yet.

12:24.890 --> 12:26.850
I need the old Blade Runner.

12:27.010 --> 12:28.600
I need your magic.

12:29.890 --> 12:32.810
I was quit when I come in here, Bryant.

12:33.600 --> 12:35.520
I'm twice as quit now.

12:35.690 --> 12:38.570
Stop right where you are.
You know the score, pal?

12:39.230 --> 12:41.530
If you're not cop, you're little people.

12:53.620 --> 12:55.040
No choice, huh?

12:56.540 --> 12:58.460
No choice, pal.

12:58.790 --> 13:01.920
<i>I already had an IQ test this year.</i>

13:02.090 --> 13:04.170
<i>I don't think I've ever
had one of these.</i>

13:04.340 --> 13:06.840
<i>Reaction time is a factor,
so please pay attention.</i>

13:07.010 --> 13:09.100
<i>- Answer as quickly as you can.
- Yeah, sure.</i>

13:09.260 --> 13:12.270
<i>1187 at Hunterwasser.</i>

13:12.430 --> 13:13.850
<i>Yeah. That's the hotel.</i>

13:14.020 --> 13:16.270
<i>- What?
- Where I live.</i>

13:16.440 --> 13:18.690
<i>- Nice place?
- Yeah, sure, I guess.</i>

13:18.860 --> 13:21.860
There was an escape from
the Off-world colonies two weeks ago.

13:22.030 --> 13:24.490
Six Replicants: three male, three female.

13:24.650 --> 13:27.160
They slaughtered 23 people
and jumped a shuttle.

13:27.320 --> 13:29.620
An aerial patrol spotted
the ship off the coast.

13:29.780 --> 13:31.580
No crew, no sight of them.

13:31.740 --> 13:34.660
Three nights ago they tried to break
into Tyrell Corporation.

13:34.830 --> 13:37.420
Two of them got fried running
through an electrical field.

13:37.580 --> 13:39.500
We lost the others.

13:40.460 --> 13:44.130
On the possibility they might try
to infiltrate as employees...

13:44.300 --> 13:48.510
...I had Holden go over and run
Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers.

13:48.680 --> 13:50.470
Looks like he got himself one.

13:50.640 --> 13:54.220
<i>So you look down and you see
a tortoise. It's crawling towards you.</i>

13:54.390 --> 13:55.600
<i>- Tortoise?
- That's Leon.</i>

13:55.770 --> 13:57.940
Ammunition loader
on intergalactic runs.

13:58.100 --> 14:01.190
He can lift 400-pound atomic loads
all day and night.

14:01.360 --> 14:03.730
The only way you can hurt him
is to kill him.

14:03.940 --> 14:08.320
I don't get it. What do they risk coming
back to Earth for? That's unusual. Why...?

14:08.490 --> 14:11.240
What do they want
out of the Tyrell Corporation?

14:11.410 --> 14:14.200
Well, you tell me, pal.
That's what you're here for.

14:25.460 --> 14:29.130
- What's this?
- Nexus 6. Roy Batty.

14:29.300 --> 14:31.260
Incept date: 2016.

14:31.430 --> 14:34.180
Combat model. Optimum self-sufficiency.

14:35.560 --> 14:37.480
Probably the leader.

14:40.900 --> 14:42.520
This is Zhora.

14:42.690 --> 14:45.150
She's trained for
an Off-world kick murder squad.

14:45.940 --> 14:49.820
Talk about Beauty and the Beast.
She's both.

14:53.910 --> 14:57.830
The fourth skin-job is Pris,
a basic pleasure model.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.830
The standard item for military clubs
in the outer colonies.

15:03.040 --> 15:06.840
They were designed to copy human beings
in every way except their emotions.

15:07.010 --> 15:09.090
The designers reckoned
after a few years...

15:09.260 --> 15:11.760
...they might develop
their own emotional responses.

15:12.760 --> 15:15.350
Oh, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.

15:15.510 --> 15:17.730
So they built in a fail-safe device.

15:17.890 --> 15:21.230
- Which is what?
- Four-year lifespan.

15:27.320 --> 15:30.900
Now, there's a Nexus 6
over at the Tyrell Corporation.

15:31.070 --> 15:35.280
- I want you to go put the machine on it.
- And if the machine doesn't work?

17:06.920 --> 17:07.960
Do you like our owI?

17:11.460 --> 17:13.220
It's artificial?

17:14.220 --> 17:16.180
Of course it is.

17:17.550 --> 17:18.849
Must be expensive.

17:21.060 --> 17:23.560
Very. I'm Rachael.

17:24.480 --> 17:25.520
Deckard.

17:27.980 --> 17:32.070
It seems you feel our work
is not a benefit to the public.

17:32.990 --> 17:37.200
Replicants are like any other machine:
They're either a benefit or a hazard.

17:37.360 --> 17:40.120
If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.

17:40.280 --> 17:43.120
May I ask you a personal question?

17:44.790 --> 17:46.500
Sure.

17:50.540 --> 17:52.880
Have you ever retired a human
by mistake?

17:55.220 --> 17:56.260
No.

17:56.430 --> 18:00.220
- But in your position, that is a risk.
- Is this to be an empathy test?

18:01.560 --> 18:05.100
Capillary dilation
of the so-called blush response?

18:05.730 --> 18:08.980
Fluctuation of the pupil.

18:09.940 --> 18:12.980
Involuntary dilation of the iris.

18:14.440 --> 18:16.320
We call it Voight-Kampff for short.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.620
Mr. Deckard, Dr. EIdon Tyrell.

18:20.570 --> 18:22.490
Demonstrate it.

18:23.330 --> 18:24.660
I wanna see it work.

18:24.830 --> 18:27.460
- Where's the subject?
- I wanna see it work on a person.

18:27.620 --> 18:30.540
I wanna see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.420
What's that gonna prove?

18:33.460 --> 18:35.380
Indulge me.

18:35.550 --> 18:37.090
On you?

18:37.260 --> 18:38.550
Try her.

18:43.970 --> 18:46.180
It's too bright in here.

19:23.550 --> 19:24.810
Do you mind if I smoke?

19:26.220 --> 19:27.640
It won't affect the test.

19:29.810 --> 19:32.980
All right, I'm gonna ask you
a series of questions.

19:33.150 --> 19:36.570
Just relax and answer them
as simply as you can.

19:44.070 --> 19:47.290
It's your birthday.
Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.

19:47.450 --> 19:49.290
I wouldn't accept it.

19:49.460 --> 19:53.880
AIso, I'd report the person
who gave it to me to the police.

19:54.960 --> 19:58.300
You've got a little boy.
He shows you his butterfly collection...

19:58.460 --> 20:00.300
...plus the killing jar.

20:03.800 --> 20:05.350
I'd take him to the doctor.

20:11.390 --> 20:12.730
You're watching television.

20:12.900 --> 20:15.610
Suddenly you realize
there's a wasp crawling on your arm.

20:15.770 --> 20:17.980
I'd kill it.

20:20.860 --> 20:24.530
You're reading a magazine. You come
across a full-page nude photo of a girl.

20:24.700 --> 20:27.870
Is this testing whether I'm a Replicant
or a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?

20:28.040 --> 20:30.330
Just answer the questions, please.

20:34.790 --> 20:36.420
You show it to your husband.

20:36.590 --> 20:39.130
He likes it so much
he hangs it on your bedroom wall.

20:39.300 --> 20:40.760
- -bush outside your window?

20:40.920 --> 20:42.260
I wouldn't let him.

20:42.420 --> 20:43.880
- -orange body, green legs?

20:44.050 --> 20:45.390
Why not?

20:45.550 --> 20:47.680
I should be enough for him.

20:51.430 --> 20:53.440
One more question.

20:54.230 --> 20:57.270
You're watching a stage play,
a banquet is in progress.

20:57.440 --> 21:01.570
The guests are enjoying
an appetizer of raw oysters.

21:01.740 --> 21:04.820
The entrée consists of boiled dog.

21:21.380 --> 21:24.010
Would you step out
for a few moments, Rachael?

21:33.640 --> 21:35.310
Thank you.

21:36.560 --> 21:38.940
She's a Replicant, isn't she?

21:39.110 --> 21:40.860
I'm impressed.

21:41.030 --> 21:43.740
How many questions
does it usually take to spot one?

21:43.860 --> 21:46.570
- I don't get it, Tyrell.
- How many questions?

21:46.740 --> 21:49.450
Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.

21:49.700 --> 21:52.160
It took more than a hundred for Rachael,
didn't it?

21:52.330 --> 21:54.160
She doesn't know.

21:54.330 --> 21:56.120
She's beginning to suspect, I think.

21:56.290 --> 21:58.380
Suspect?
How can it not know what it is?

21:58.830 --> 22:01.710
Commerce is our goal here at Tyrell.

22:01.880 --> 22:04.130
''More human than human'' is our motto.

22:04.300 --> 22:07.970
Rachael is an experiment, nothing more.

22:08.140 --> 22:12.560
We began to recognize in them
a strange obsession.

22:12.720 --> 22:16.140
After all, they are emotionally
inexperienced, with only a few years...

22:16.310 --> 22:19.810
...in which to store up the experiences
which you and I take for granted.

22:19.980 --> 22:25.490
If we gift them with a past, we create
a cushion or a pillow for their emotions...

22:25.650 --> 22:28.450
...then consequently
we can control them better.

22:28.610 --> 22:30.450
Memories.

22:30.620 --> 22:32.580
You're talking about memories.

22:42.880 --> 22:45.380
<i>Reaction time is a factor,
so please pay attention.</i>

22:45.550 --> 22:47.510
<i>- Now answer as quickly as you can.
- Sure.</i>

22:47.680 --> 22:50.300
<i>-  1187 at Hunterwasser.
- Yeah. That's the hotel.</i>

22:50.470 --> 22:51.680
<i>- What?
- Where I live.</i>

22:51.850 --> 22:53.470
<i>- Nice place?
- Yeah, sure, I guess.</i>

22:53.640 --> 22:55.470
<i>- Is that part of the test?
- No.</i>

23:26.050 --> 23:28.170
Kowalski.

25:15.320 --> 25:17.700
Time...

25:17.870 --> 25:19.080
...enough.

25:37.140 --> 25:40.100
Did you get your precious photos?

25:42.930 --> 25:45.100
Someone was there.

25:45.730 --> 25:47.520
Men?

25:51.150 --> 25:54.610
Policemen?

27:26.750 --> 27:30.000
<i>Fiery the angels fell</i>

27:30.170 --> 27:33.420
<i>Deep thunder rolled around their shores</i>

27:33.840 --> 27:37.170
<i>Burning with the fires of Orc</i>

27:39.930 --> 27:43.430
You not come here! lllegal!

27:46.350 --> 27:47.980
Hey! Hey!

27:49.270 --> 27:52.520
Cold! Those are my eyes! Freezing!

28:03.160 --> 28:04.780
Yes.

28:04.950 --> 28:06.490
Questions.

28:13.420 --> 28:15.670
Hey! Hey!

28:28.720 --> 28:33.270
Morphology. Longevity. Incept dates.

28:33.440 --> 28:34.940
Don't know.

28:35.110 --> 28:37.400
I don't know such stuff.

28:39.280 --> 28:41.240
I just do eyes.

28:41.400 --> 28:44.240
Just eyes, just genetic design.

28:44.410 --> 28:46.240
Just eyes.

28:48.120 --> 28:50.370
You Nexus, huh?

28:50.540 --> 28:53.120
I design your eyes.

28:53.290 --> 28:55.290
Chew...

28:55.460 --> 29:00.550
...if only you could see
what I've seen with your eyes.

29:00.710 --> 29:02.630
Now...

29:02.800 --> 29:04.640
...questions.

29:04.800 --> 29:06.890
I don't know answers.

29:07.050 --> 29:08.890
Who does?

29:12.350 --> 29:13.770
Tyrell.

29:13.940 --> 29:15.310
He knows everything.

29:17.190 --> 29:19.570
Tyrell Corporation?

29:19.730 --> 29:23.780
He big boss. Big genius.
He design your mind.

29:23.950 --> 29:25.820
Your brain, huh?

29:26.990 --> 29:28.700
Smart.

29:30.540 --> 29:32.660
Very cold.

29:34.790 --> 29:38.420
Not an easy man to see...

29:39.250 --> 29:41.670
Give me coat.

29:42.840 --> 29:44.170
...I guess?

29:49.510 --> 29:51.470
Sebastian.

29:52.100 --> 29:55.480
He take you there.
He take you there.

29:55.640 --> 29:58.190
Sebastian who?

30:00.570 --> 30:03.490
J.F...

30:03.650 --> 30:06.610
...Sebast... .

30:08.200 --> 30:10.030
Now...

30:12.490 --> 30:14.540
...where...

30:14.710 --> 30:17.790
...would we find this...

30:17.960 --> 30:21.340
...J.F. Sebastian?

30:22.000 --> 30:24.210
<i>Let's continue, shall we?</i>

30:24.380 --> 30:26.470
<i>Describe in single words...</i>

30:26.630 --> 30:30.300
<i>...only the good things that come
into your mind about your mother.</i>

30:30.470 --> 30:32.600
<i>- My mother?
- Yeah.</i>

30:32.770 --> 30:34.350
<i>I'll tell you about my mother.</i>

30:56.410 --> 30:59.540
<i>Voice print identification.
Your floor number, please.</i>

30:59.710 --> 31:03.960
<i>- Deckard, 97.
- 97. Thank you. Danke.</i>

31:24.780 --> 31:27.030
I wanted to see you.

31:32.410 --> 31:34.120
So I waited.

31:34.280 --> 31:36.290
Let me help you.

31:39.330 --> 31:41.630
What do I need help for?

31:43.460 --> 31:45.800
I don't know why
he told you what he did.

31:45.960 --> 31:47.050
Talk to him.

31:47.630 --> 31:49.840
He wouldn't see me.

32:02.150 --> 32:04.020
You want a drink?

32:06.690 --> 32:08.150
No?

32:14.330 --> 32:16.910
You think I'm a Replicant, don't you?

32:22.620 --> 32:24.210
Look.

32:25.000 --> 32:27.760
It's me with my mother.

32:28.760 --> 32:30.380
Yeah?

32:36.510 --> 32:39.220
Remember when you were 6?

32:39.350 --> 32:43.020
You and your brother snuck into an empty
building through a basement window.

32:43.190 --> 32:45.520
You were gonna play doctor?

32:46.400 --> 32:50.030
He showed you his, and when it got
to be your turn, you chickened and ran.

32:50.190 --> 32:51.860
Remember that?

32:54.070 --> 32:58.450
Did you ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody, huh?

33:00.620 --> 33:03.830
You remember the spider that lived
in the bush outside your window?

33:04.630 --> 33:07.000
Orange body, green legs?

33:07.170 --> 33:09.920
Watched her build a web all summer?

33:10.090 --> 33:12.510
Then one day, there's a big egg in it.

33:12.680 --> 33:14.390
The egg hatched... .

33:14.550 --> 33:17.100
- The egg hatched...
- And?

33:17.510 --> 33:20.470
...and a hundred baby spiders came out.

33:21.680 --> 33:23.020
And they ate her.

33:27.770 --> 33:29.610
Implants.

33:29.780 --> 33:32.530
Those aren't your memories,
they're somebody else's.

33:32.700 --> 33:35.160
They're Tyrell's niece's.

33:43.120 --> 33:44.830
Okay.

33:45.000 --> 33:46.580
Bad joke.

33:46.750 --> 33:48.340
I made a bad joke.

33:48.500 --> 33:50.170
You're not a Replicant.

33:50.340 --> 33:51.380
Go home.

33:51.550 --> 33:53.220
Okay?

33:55.380 --> 33:58.470
No, really. I'm sorry.

33:59.010 --> 34:00.760
Go home.

34:13.780 --> 34:14.860
Want a drink?

34:16.780 --> 34:18.989
I'll get you a drink.

34:19.159 --> 34:21.489
I'll get a glass.

38:05.590 --> 38:07.090
Hey!

38:12.270 --> 38:14.480
You forgot your bag.

38:24.990 --> 38:26.950
I'm lost.

38:28.320 --> 38:30.280
Don't worry, I won't hurt you.

38:34.460 --> 38:35.660
What's your name?

38:35.830 --> 38:39.170
- Pris.
- Mine's J.F. Sebastian.

38:39.340 --> 38:41.380
- Hi.
- Hi.

38:44.720 --> 38:46.800
Oh, where were you going?

38:48.840 --> 38:50.390
Home?

38:51.720 --> 38:53.600
I don't have one.

38:57.060 --> 38:59.270
We scared each other pretty good,
didn't we?

38:59.440 --> 39:01.230
We sure did.

39:06.740 --> 39:09.030
I'm hungry, J.F.

39:09.490 --> 39:11.870
I got stuff inside.

39:12.280 --> 39:13.740
You wanna come in?

39:13.910 --> 39:16.250
I was hoping you'd say that.

39:50.410 --> 39:52.570
Do you live in this building
all by yourself?

39:52.740 --> 39:55.910
Yeah, I live here
pretty much alone right now.

39:56.450 --> 39:59.080
No housing shortage around here.

40:01.130 --> 40:03.670
Plenty of room for everybody.

40:12.680 --> 40:15.010
Watch out for the water.

40:16.930 --> 40:19.850
Must get lonely here, J.F.

40:21.900 --> 40:24.610
Not really. I make friends.

40:24.770 --> 40:28.150
They're toys. My friends are toys.
I make them.

40:28.320 --> 40:30.650
It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer.

40:30.820 --> 40:32.700
Do you know what that is?

40:32.870 --> 40:34.450
No.

40:36.410 --> 40:37.910
Now.

40:42.580 --> 40:45.380
Yoo-hoo, home again.

40:50.380 --> 40:53.180
Home again, home again, jiggidy-jig.

40:53.340 --> 40:56.430
- Good evening, J.F.
- Evening, fellas.

41:08.190 --> 41:10.610
They're my friends. I made them.

41:10.780 --> 41:12.610
Where are your folks?

41:12.780 --> 41:14.280
I'm sort of an orphan.

41:15.120 --> 41:16.660
What about your friends?

41:16.830 --> 41:19.290
I have some, but I have to find them.

41:19.450 --> 41:22.040
I'll let them know where I am tomorrow.

41:25.920 --> 41:30.170
Can I take those things for you?
They're soaked, aren't they?

43:09.310 --> 43:12.020
Enhance 224 to 176.

43:29.580 --> 43:31.040
Enhance.

43:31.210 --> 43:32.670
Stop.

43:46.430 --> 43:48.270
Move in.

43:48.440 --> 43:50.060
Stop.

43:50.730 --> 43:52.520
Pull out, track right.

43:52.690 --> 43:54.480
Stop.

43:55.730 --> 43:58.150
Center and pull back.

44:00.280 --> 44:02.160
Stop.

44:03.240 --> 44:05.040
Track 45 right.

44:07.080 --> 44:08.210
Stop.

44:08.370 --> 44:10.170
Center and stop.

44:16.050 --> 44:19.130
Enhance 34 to 36.

44:28.810 --> 44:31.350
Pan right and pull back.

44:32.190 --> 44:33.770
Stop.

44:39.240 --> 44:40.950
Enhance 34 to 46.

44:52.960 --> 44:54.960
Pull back.

44:55.340 --> 44:57.000
Wait a minute. Go right.

44:58.460 --> 45:00.090
Stop.

45:00.510 --> 45:01.930
Enhance 57-19.

45:04.390 --> 45:06.850
Track 45 left.

45:08.520 --> 45:10.350
Stop.

45:12.020 --> 45:14.770
Enhance 15 to 23.

45:25.660 --> 45:28.040
Give me a hard copy right there.

46:24.800 --> 46:26.390
Fish?

46:41.690 --> 46:44.740
I think it was manufactured locally.

46:49.330 --> 46:54.000
Finest quality. Superior workmanship.

46:54.830 --> 46:57.080
There is the maker's serial number.

46:57.250 --> 47:03.800
9906947-XB71.

47:04.550 --> 47:05.880
Interesting.

47:07.010 --> 47:10.930
Not fish. Snake scale.

47:11.100 --> 47:12.510
Snake.

47:12.680 --> 47:17.350
Try Abdul Ben Hassan.
He make this snake!

48:19.040 --> 48:20.790
Abdul Hassan?

48:21.830 --> 48:25.210
I'm a police officer.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

48:25.380 --> 48:28.470
Artificial snake license XB71, that's you?

48:29.470 --> 48:32.300
This is your work, huh?
Who did you sell it to?

48:32.470 --> 48:35.180
My work? Not too many
could afford such quality.

48:35.350 --> 48:36.470
How many?

48:36.640 --> 48:38.850
- Very few.
- How few?

48:39.020 --> 48:40.690
- Look, my friend--
- Taffey Lewis' .

48:40.850 --> 48:44.320
Down in Fourth Sector, Chinatown.

48:45.360 --> 48:49.650
<i>Cross now. Cross now. Cross now.</i>

48:49.820 --> 48:54.280
<i>Cross now. Cross now. Cross now.</i>

48:54.450 --> 48:57.490
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

49:20.810 --> 49:22.650
Bartender.

49:26.230 --> 49:28.150
Taffey Lewis?

49:28.900 --> 49:30.440
Thank you.

49:33.450 --> 49:35.320
- Taffey?
- Yeah?

49:35.950 --> 49:38.200
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

49:38.370 --> 49:40.160
Blow.

49:41.830 --> 49:44.170
You ever buy snakes
from the Egyptian, Taffey?

49:44.330 --> 49:45.750
All the time, pal.

49:48.590 --> 49:49.920
You ever see this girl, huh?

49:51.420 --> 49:52.930
Never seen her. Buzz off.

49:53.090 --> 49:54.930
Your licenses in order, pal?

49:55.720 --> 49:57.220
Hey, Louie.

49:57.390 --> 50:01.980
The man is dry. Give him one
on the house, okay? See?

50:44.310 --> 50:46.020
Hello?

50:47.900 --> 50:51.530
I've had people walk out on me before,
but not when...

50:51.690 --> 50:53.900
...I was being so charming.

50:54.070 --> 50:58.120
I'm in a bar, here now,
down in the Fourth Sector.

50:59.240 --> 51:00.660
Taffey Lewis is on the line.

51:00.830 --> 51:04.040
Why don't you come on down here
and have a drink?

51:04.200 --> 51:06.750
<i>I don't think so, Mr. Deckard.</i>

51:07.960 --> 51:09.290
<i>That's not my kind of place.</i>

51:09.960 --> 51:11.000
Go someplace else?

51:26.940 --> 51:29.480
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

51:29.650 --> 51:34.900
<i>... Taffey Lewis presents
Miss Salome and the snake.</i>

51:35.070 --> 51:39.450
<i>Watch her take the pleasure
from the serpent...</i>

51:39.620 --> 51:43.370
<i>... that once corrupted man.</i>

52:25.620 --> 52:28.330
Excuse me, Miss Salome,
can I talk to you for a minute?

52:28.500 --> 52:32.630
I'm from the American Federation
of Variety Artists.

52:32.790 --> 52:33.840
Oh, yeah?

52:34.000 --> 52:37.800
I'm not here to make you join.
No, ma'am. That's not my department.

52:37.970 --> 52:39.840
Actually...

52:42.010 --> 52:46.430
...I'm from the Confidential Committee
on Moral Abuses.

52:47.390 --> 52:49.230
Committee of Moral Abuses?

52:49.390 --> 52:51.560
There's been reports
that the management...

52:51.730 --> 52:53.900
...has been taking liberties
with the artists.

52:54.060 --> 52:55.520
I don't know nothing about it.

52:55.690 --> 52:58.690
Have you felt yourself to be
exploited in any way?

52:58.860 --> 53:01.320
How do you mean ''exploited''?

53:01.490 --> 53:04.030
Well, like to get this job.

53:04.200 --> 53:09.120
I mean, did you do, or were you
asked to do, anything that's...

53:09.290 --> 53:11.500
...lewd or unsavory or...

53:11.670 --> 53:15.540
...otherwise repulsive
to your person, huh?

53:18.260 --> 53:21.130
- Are you for real?
- Oh, yeah.

53:21.300 --> 53:24.550
I'd like to check
your dressing room, if I may.

53:24.720 --> 53:27.430
- For what?
- For holes.

53:27.600 --> 53:28.640
Holes?

53:28.810 --> 53:31.600
Well, you'd be surprised
what a guy would go through...

53:31.770 --> 53:34.610
...to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.

53:37.780 --> 53:38.900
No, I wouldn't.

53:39.070 --> 53:41.200
Little...

53:41.360 --> 53:46.830
...dirty holes they drill in the wall
so they can watch a lady undress.

54:20.190 --> 54:23.530
- Is this a real snake?
- Of course it's not real.

54:23.700 --> 54:27.830
Think I'd be working in a place like this
if I could afford a real snake?

54:41.920 --> 54:44.930
So if somebody does try to exploit me,
who do I go to about it?

54:45.090 --> 54:49.260
- Me.
- You're a dedicated man. Dry me.

55:15.660 --> 55:17.460
The only thing they care about--

55:17.620 --> 55:18.790
Hey!

56:45.550 --> 56:48.260
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

56:48.420 --> 56:51.590
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

56:51.760 --> 56:54.470
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

56:54.640 --> 56:57.560
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

56:57.730 --> 57:01.060
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

57:01.690 --> 57:03.860
<i>Don't walk. Don't walk.</i>

57:04.020 --> 57:06.150
<i>Don't walk. Don't walk.</i>

57:06.320 --> 57:09.360
<i>Don't walk. Don't walk. Don't walk.</i>

57:24.080 --> 57:27.130
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

57:27.500 --> 57:30.300
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

57:30.470 --> 57:32.720
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

57:33.430 --> 57:36.430
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

57:36.600 --> 57:38.180
<i>Cross now. Cross now.</i>

57:38.350 --> 57:40.180
Move! Get out of the way!

59:26.500 --> 59:28.080
Deckard.

59:28.250 --> 59:29.840
B26354.

59:36.340 --> 59:39.090
<i>Move on. Move on.</i>

59:39.260 --> 59:41.510
<i>Move on. Move on.</i>

59:41.680 --> 59:44.890
<i>Move on. Move on.</i>

59:50.560 --> 59:52.270
A minute.

59:54.530 --> 59:56.070
Yeah, what do you want?

59:56.240 --> 59:58.030
Tsingtao.

01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:07.120
This enough?

01:00:07.290 --> 01:00:08.790
Yeah.

01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:19.300
Bryant.

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:43.160
Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad
as that skin-job you left on the sidewalk.

01:00:43.330 --> 01:00:44.580
I'm going home.

01:00:44.740 --> 01:00:46.660
Could learn from this guy, Gaff.

01:00:46.830 --> 01:00:49.620
He's a goddamn one-man
slaughterhouse, that's what he is.

01:00:50.420 --> 01:00:52.170
Four more to go.

01:00:52.330 --> 01:00:54.090
- Come on, Gaff, let's go.
- Three.

01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:57.550
There's three to go.

01:00:58.170 --> 01:01:00.430
There's four.

01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:03.430
That skin-job you VK'd
at the Tyrell Corporation...

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:07.470
...Rachael, disappeared, vanished.
Didn't even know she was a Replicant.

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:10.520
Something to do with a brain implant,
says Tyrell.

01:01:10.690 --> 01:01:14.020
Come on, Gaff.
Drink some for me, huh, pal?

01:01:58.650 --> 01:01:59.690
Leon.

01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:01.570
How old am I?

01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:07.580
I don't know.

01:02:09.830 --> 01:02:13.080
My birthday's April 10, 2017.
How long do I live?

01:02:13.250 --> 01:02:15.040
Four years.

01:02:22.050 --> 01:02:23.300
More than you.

01:02:28.310 --> 01:02:31.060
Painful to live in fear, isn't it?

01:02:36.610 --> 01:02:39.860
Nothing is worse than having
an itch you can never scratch.

01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:42.240
I agree.

01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:55.330
Wake up. Time to die.

01:03:30.450 --> 01:03:32.330
Shakes?

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:35.500
Me too.

01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:41.380
I get them bad.

01:03:46.970 --> 01:03:49.140
It's part of the business.

01:03:56.390 --> 01:03:57.770
I'm not in the business.

01:04:11.330 --> 01:04:13.540
I am the business.

01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:47.710
What if I go north?

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:52.840
Disappear.

01:05:58.270 --> 01:05:59.600
Would you come after me?

01:06:01.730 --> 01:06:03.440
Hunt me?

01:06:08.190 --> 01:06:09.820
No.

01:06:12.490 --> 01:06:14.490
No, I wouldn't.

01:06:20.250 --> 01:06:21.410
I owe you one.

01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:38.930
But somebody would.

01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:53.200
Deckard...

01:06:55.660 --> 01:06:57.830
...you know those files on me?

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:02.790
The incept date. The longevity.

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:04.870
Those things.

01:07:06.210 --> 01:07:08.040
You saw them?

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:13.220
They're...

01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:14.590
...classified.

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:17.260
But you're a policeman.

01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:19.510
I...

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:21.640
...didn't look at them.

01:07:23.730 --> 01:07:25.980
You know,
that Voight-Kampff test of yours...

01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:29.980
...did you ever take that test yourself?

01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:43.540
Deckard.

01:10:13.810 --> 01:10:15.560
I dreamt music.

01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:23.360
I didn't know if I could play.

01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:27.790
I remember lessons.

01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:32.620
I don't know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.

01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:39.550
You play beautifully.

01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:52.080
Now you kiss me.

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:54.960
I can't rely on my--

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:57.750
Say, ''Kiss me. ''

01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:02.380
Kiss me.

01:12:13.850 --> 01:12:15.770
I want you.

01:12:18.850 --> 01:12:20.400
I want you.

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.150
Again.

01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:24.190
I want you.

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:29.780
Put your hands on me.

01:13:51.570 --> 01:13:54.910
- What you doing?
- I'm sorry. Just peeking.

01:13:58.790 --> 01:14:01.920
- How do I look?
- You look better.

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:05.130
- Just better?
- Well...

01:14:05.290 --> 01:14:06.550
...you look beautiful.

01:14:10.170 --> 01:14:11.840
Thanks.

01:14:18.270 --> 01:14:20.180
How old are you?

01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:24.150
Twenty-five.

01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:27.230
- What's your problem?
- Methuselah syndrome.

01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:28.730
What's that?

01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:31.900
My glands, they grow old too fast.

01:14:33.110 --> 01:14:37.330
- Is that why you're still on Earth?
- Yeah. I couldn't pass the medical.

01:14:40.330 --> 01:14:41.540
Anyway...

01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:43.170
...I kind of like it here.

01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:47.800
I like you...

01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:49.210
...just the way you are.

01:14:52.470 --> 01:14:54.260
Hi, Roy.

01:14:54.430 --> 01:14:55.840
Hi.

01:14:56.010 --> 01:14:57.720
Gosh, you...

01:14:57.890 --> 01:15:00.180
...really got some nice toys here.

01:15:00.350 --> 01:15:02.730
This is the friend I was telling you about.

01:15:02.890 --> 01:15:06.110
This is my savior, J.F. Sebastian.

01:15:06.270 --> 01:15:07.770
Sebastian.

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:11.150
I like a man that stays put.

01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:16.030
You live here all by yourself, do you?

01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:17.240
Yes.

01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:31.170
How about some breakfast?

01:15:31.340 --> 01:15:33.300
I was just gonna make some.

01:15:33.470 --> 01:15:34.510
Excuse me.

01:15:41.890 --> 01:15:43.520
Well?

01:15:45.770 --> 01:15:47.020
Leon... .

01:15:47.190 --> 01:15:49.190
What's going on?

01:15:53.490 --> 01:15:55.200
There's only two of us now.

01:15:57.410 --> 01:16:00.490
Then we're stupid and we'll die.

01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:06.750
No, we won't.

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:41.280
No.

01:16:41.450 --> 01:16:43.950
Knight takes queen, see?

01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:46.040
Won't do.

01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:56.510
Why are you staring at us, Sebastian?

01:16:56.670 --> 01:16:58.050
Because...

01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:00.390
...you're so different.

01:17:01.930 --> 01:17:04.010
You're so perfect.

01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:08.770
Yes.

01:17:08.940 --> 01:17:11.060
What generation are you?

01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:20.410
Nexus 6.

01:17:21.450 --> 01:17:22.830
I knew it.

01:17:22.990 --> 01:17:26.250
Because I do genetic design work
for the Tyrell Corporation.

01:17:26.410 --> 01:17:28.620
There's some of me in you.

01:17:29.710 --> 01:17:31.460
Show me something.

01:17:31.630 --> 01:17:33.380
Like what?

01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:35.460
Like anything.

01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:42.090
We're no computers, Sebastian.
We're physical.

01:17:43.890 --> 01:17:46.140
I think, Sebastian...

01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:48.730
...therefore, I am.

01:17:48.890 --> 01:17:52.190
Very good, Pris. Now show him why.

01:18:19.090 --> 01:18:20.840
We've got a lot in common.

01:18:21.010 --> 01:18:23.260
- What do you mean?
- Similar problems.

01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:26.220
Accelerated decrepitude.

01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:30.890
I don't know much about bio-mechanics,
Roy. I wish I did.

01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:35.480
If we don't find help soon...

01:18:35.650 --> 01:18:38.570
...Pris hasn't got long to live.

01:18:38.730 --> 01:18:40.490
We can't allow that.

01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:45.910
- Is he good?
- Who?

01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:49.450
- Your opponent.
- Oh, Dr. Tyrell?

01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:53.080
I've only beaten him once in chess.
He's a genius.

01:18:55.330 --> 01:18:56.380
He designed you.

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:01.380
Maybe he could help.

01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:04.090
I'd be happy to mention it to him.

01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:09.680
Better if I talk to him in person.

01:19:12.810 --> 01:19:17.860
But I understand
he's a sort of hard man to get to.

01:19:18.020 --> 01:19:19.980
Yes.

01:19:20.150 --> 01:19:21.780
Very.

01:19:24.700 --> 01:19:27.120
Will you help us?

01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:29.160
I can't.

01:19:29.330 --> 01:19:31.330
We need you, Sebastian.

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:34.370
You're our best and only friend.

01:19:47.390 --> 01:19:49.850
We're so happy you found us.

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:53.770
I don't think
there's another human being...

01:19:53.930 --> 01:19:56.230
...in the whole world
who would've helped us.

01:20:45.190 --> 01:20:48.780
66,000 Prosser & Ankovich.

01:20:49.950 --> 01:20:51.410
Trade.

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:54.330
<i>- Trade at two--
- Blue entry.</i>

01:20:55.330 --> 01:20:58.710
<i>A Mr. J.F. Sebastian.</i>

01:20:58.870 --> 01:21:02.960
<i>16417.</i>

01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:05.510
<i>At this hour?</i>

01:21:05.670 --> 01:21:08.840
<i>What can I do for you, Sebastian?</i>

01:21:11.970 --> 01:21:13.470
Queen to bishop six. Check.

01:21:19.100 --> 01:21:21.270
Nonsense.

01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:23.690
Just a moment.

01:21:26.610 --> 01:21:31.320
Queen to bishop six, ridiculous.

01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:38.710
Queen...

01:21:40.330 --> 01:21:42.380
...bishop six.

01:21:47.460 --> 01:21:49.840
<i>Knight...</i>

01:21:50.010 --> 01:21:52.260
<i>... takes queen.</i>

01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:01.480
What's on your mind, Sebastian?

01:22:01.650 --> 01:22:03.110
What are you thinking about?

01:22:04.730 --> 01:22:06.940
Bishop to king seven.

01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:09.150
Checkmate.

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:11.360
Bishop to king seven.
Checkmate, I think.

01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:16.450
Got a brainstorm, huh, Sebastian?

01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:19.540
Milk and cookies kept you awake, huh?

01:22:19.710 --> 01:22:21.870
<i>Let's discuss this.</i>

01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:24.040
<i>You better come up, Sebastian.</i>

01:22:41.690 --> 01:22:43.650
Mr. Tyrell?

01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:47.110
I... .

01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:49.190
I brought a friend.

01:22:55.450 --> 01:22:59.450
I'm surprised
you didn't come here sooner.

01:23:06.130 --> 01:23:09.250
It's not an easy thing
to meet your maker.

01:23:10.010 --> 01:23:12.930
And what can he do for you?

01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:17.180
Can the maker repair what he makes?

01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:20.680
Would you like to be modified?

01:23:20.850 --> 01:23:22.810
Stay here.

01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:31.360
Had in mind something
a little more radical.

01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:33.950
What...?

01:23:34.110 --> 01:23:36.620
What seems to be the problem?

01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:39.580
- Death.
- Death.

01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:43.330
Well, I'm afraid that's
a little out of my jurisdiction. You--

01:23:43.500 --> 01:23:46.460
I want more life...

01:23:46.630 --> 01:23:47.920
...father.

01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:54.970
The facts of life.

01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:59.180
To make an alteration in the...

01:23:59.350 --> 01:24:01.770
...evolvement of
an organic life system is fatal.

01:24:01.930 --> 01:24:05.520
A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.

01:24:05.690 --> 01:24:06.730
Why not?

01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:08.900
Because by the second day
of incubation...

01:24:09.060 --> 01:24:13.570
...any cells that have undergone
reversion mutations...

01:24:13.740 --> 01:24:17.990
...give rise to revertant colonies
like rats leaving a sinking ship.

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:19.950
Then the ship sinks.

01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:23.660
What about EMS recombination?

01:24:23.830 --> 01:24:25.370
We've already tried it.

01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:29.840
Ethyl methane sulfonate is an
alkylating agent and a potent mutagen.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:34.130
It created a virus so lethal the...

01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:36.470
...subject was dead
before he left the table.

01:24:36.630 --> 01:24:39.720
Then a repressor protein
that blocks the operating cells.

01:24:39.890 --> 01:24:43.850
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it
does give rise to an error in replication.

01:24:44.020 --> 01:24:48.730
So that the newly formed DNA strand
carries a mutation...

01:24:48.900 --> 01:24:51.770
...and you've got a virus again.

01:24:51.940 --> 01:24:56.400
But this, all of this, is...

01:24:56.570 --> 01:24:58.160
...academic.

01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:00.820
You were made
as well as we could make you.

01:25:00.990 --> 01:25:02.740
But not to last.

01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:06.750
The light that burns twice as bright
burns half as long.

01:25:06.910 --> 01:25:11.130
And you have burned
so very, very brightly, Roy.

01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:13.500
Look at you.

01:25:13.670 --> 01:25:16.220
You're the prodigal son.

01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:19.930
You're quite a prize.

01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:27.100
I've done...

01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:28.890
...questionable things.

01:25:29.060 --> 01:25:30.980
AIso extraordinary things.

01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:33.980
Revel in your time.

01:25:37.900 --> 01:25:42.450
Nothing the god of biomechanics
wouldn't let you in heaven for.

01:26:34.670 --> 01:26:37.420
Sorry, Sebastian.

01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:40.760
Come. Come.

01:27:27.220 --> 01:27:32.020
<i>Body identified with Tyrell
is a 25-year-old male Caucasian.</i>

01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:35.020
<i>Name: Sebastian, J.F. Sebastian.</i>

01:27:35.190 --> 01:27:40.070
<i>Address: Bradbury Apartments,
Ninth Sector, NF4675 1.</i>

01:27:40.230 --> 01:27:41.860
<i>I want you to go down there and--</i>

01:27:45.910 --> 01:27:48.910
<i>This sector's closed to ground traffic.
What're you doing here?</i>

01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:52.790
<i>- I'm working. What are you doing?
- Arresting you, that's what I'm doing.</i>

01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:57.670
I'm Deckard, Blade Runner.
26354. I'm filed and monitored.

01:27:57.840 --> 01:27:59.090
<i>Hold on. Checking.</i>

01:28:03.260 --> 01:28:06.970
<i>Okay. Checked and cleared.
Have a better one.</i>

01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:19.520
<i>- Hello.
- Hi. Is J.F. there?</i>

01:28:19.690 --> 01:28:23.110
<i>- Who is it?
- This is Eddie, old friend of J.F.'s.</i>

01:28:26.990 --> 01:28:28.700
That's no way to treat a friend.

01:31:27.290 --> 01:31:29.340
Home again, home again, jiggidy-jig.

01:31:30.510 --> 01:31:33.470
Good evening, J.F.

01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:45.480
<i>Tea?</i>

01:31:46.770 --> 01:31:48.610
<i>More tea?</i>

01:31:49.690 --> 01:31:50.730
<i>Tea?</i>

01:32:00.290 --> 01:32:02.450
<i>More tea?</i>

01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:06.170
<i>Tea?</i>

01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:09.630
<i>More tea?</i>

01:32:11.260 --> 01:32:13.220
<i>More tea?</i>

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:27.480
<i>More tea?</i>

01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:36.880
Not very sporting to fire
on an unarmed opponent.

01:35:38.420 --> 01:35:41.840
I thought you were
supposed to be good.

01:35:43.130 --> 01:35:45.840
Aren't you the good man?

01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:54.270
Come on, Deckard.

01:35:55.480 --> 01:35:57.360
Show me...

01:35:58.190 --> 01:36:00.320
...what you're made of.

01:36:12.330 --> 01:36:14.210
Proud of yourself, little man?

01:36:22.090 --> 01:36:23.920
This is for Zhora.

01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:26.840
This is for Pris.

01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:35.520
Come on, Deckard.

01:36:36.060 --> 01:36:39.270
I'm right here,
but you've gotta shoot straight.

01:36:40.650 --> 01:36:42.990
Straight doesn't seem
to be good enough!

01:36:43.150 --> 01:36:44.240
Now it's my turn.

01:36:46.110 --> 01:36:49.830
I'm gonna give you a few seconds
before I come.

01:36:50.580 --> 01:36:51.830
One.

01:36:51.990 --> 01:36:54.160
Two.

01:37:06.180 --> 01:37:08.050
Three.

01:37:08.220 --> 01:37:10.140
Four.

01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:24.110
Pris.

01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:39.060
I'm coming.

01:38:39.230 --> 01:38:41.020
Deckard!

01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:44.730
<i>Four, five</i>

01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:51.160
<i>How to stay alive?</i>

01:39:14.050 --> 01:39:15.680
I can see you!

01:39:41.460 --> 01:39:43.790
Not yet!

01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:45.000
Not... .

01:40:17.780 --> 01:40:19.540
Five.

01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:24.330
Five.

01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:29.710
Yes.

01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:39.100
You better get it up.

01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:41.270
Or I'm gonna have to kill you.

01:40:42.310 --> 01:40:44.560
Unless you're alive, you can't play.

01:40:44.730 --> 01:40:46.690
And if you don't play... .

01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:58.530
<i>Six, seven</i>

01:40:58.700 --> 01:41:00.620
<i>Go to hell or go to heaven</i>

01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:09.790
Good, that's the spirit!

01:41:51.130 --> 01:41:53.300
That hurt.

01:41:56.590 --> 01:41:58.720
That was irrational of you.

01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:02.010
Not to mention...

01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:05.020
...unsportsmanlike.

01:42:08.890 --> 01:42:11.060
Where are you going?

01:45:15.540 --> 01:45:19.420
Quite an experience to live in fear,
isn't it?

01:45:21.130 --> 01:45:24.170
That's what it is to be a slave.

01:46:23.070 --> 01:46:24.360
I've...

01:46:24.530 --> 01:46:29.570
...seen things
you people wouldn't believe.

01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:36.330
Attack ships on fire
off the shoulder of Orion.

01:46:38.250 --> 01:46:40.580
I watched C-beams...

01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:44.460
...glitter in the dark
near the Tannhäuser Gate.

01:46:48.630 --> 01:46:50.680
All those...

01:46:50.840 --> 01:46:53.890
...moments will be lost...

01:46:54.050 --> 01:46:56.310
...in time...

01:46:57.850 --> 01:47:00.100
...like...

01:47:00.270 --> 01:47:02.020
...tears...

01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:05.690
...in rain.

01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:11.860
Time to die.

01:48:17.810 --> 01:48:20.720
You've done a man's job, sir.

01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:28.770
I guess you're through, huh?

01:48:30.820 --> 01:48:32.610
Finished.

01:48:54.630 --> 01:48:57.640
It's too bad she won't live.

01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:01.140
But then again, who does?

01:49:34.760 --> 01:49:36.630
Rachael?

01:49:44.350 --> 01:49:46.060
Rachael?

01:49:59.950 --> 01:50:01.530
Rachael?

01:51:08.270 --> 01:51:10.060
Do you love me?

01:51:11.190 --> 01:51:12.940
I love you.

01:51:13.810 --> 01:51:15.690
Do you trust me?

01:51:16.900 --> 01:51:18.860
I trust you.

01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:29.960
Rachael?

01:52:09.540 --> 01:52:12.410
<i>It's too bad she won't live.</i>

01:52:12.580 --> 01:52:15.210
<i>But then again, who does?</i>
