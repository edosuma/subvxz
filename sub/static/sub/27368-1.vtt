01:17.074 --> 01:19.605
Well, look who decided
to show up.

01:19.607 --> 01:21.605
Mr. Newbie-on-wheels.

01:21.607 --> 01:24.339
Hey, Joe, how are things
down at Jurassic World?

01:24.341 --> 01:27.738
Seriously, shouldn't you be on
display in some museum by now?

01:27.740 --> 01:31.273
Let's see if you can move
as fast as that mouth, kid!

01:58.875 --> 02:00.106
Man!

02:00.108 --> 02:01.439
All right!

02:01.441 --> 02:03.673
That cheat's gonna get beat!

02:05.708 --> 02:10.038
Move it
'cause you're gonna lose it!

02:10.041 --> 02:11.275
Yeah!

02:18.341 --> 02:21.472
Can you believe it?
The last race of the season,

02:21.474 --> 02:24.506
and the two top cars in the
championship neck and neck!

02:24.508 --> 02:25.773
Who would've guessed!

02:25.775 --> 02:28.373
Well, in my pre-season analysis

02:28.375 --> 02:30.906
I did point out
things would be close,

02:30.908 --> 02:33.874
just like the race in '86,
when I was commenting...

02:33.876 --> 02:35.806
Anyhow, look at this.

02:35.808 --> 02:39.540
Wheely O'Wheels, the rookie star
from right here in Gasket City

02:39.542 --> 02:42.675
now accelerates into the lead!

02:50.708 --> 02:52.540
Move out of the way!

02:52.542 --> 02:54.573
You think you're
invisible, man?

02:54.575 --> 02:56.106
But of course he's up against

02:56.108 --> 02:59.040
the overwhelming favorite
for the race, Joe Flo.

02:59.042 --> 03:02.774
- A four-times winner.
- Three-times winner.

03:02.776 --> 03:05.839
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Joe now moves back to the front!

03:05.841 --> 03:07.540
- Hurry, Mr. Wheely!
- Nah.

03:07.542 --> 03:10.074
Wheely O'Wheels
has no chance of winning.

03:10.076 --> 03:12.406
You don't know Mr. Wheely
like Putt Putt does.

03:12.408 --> 03:13.774
What, you know him?

03:13.776 --> 03:15.707
Of course Putt Putt knows
Mr. Wheely.

03:15.709 --> 03:18.876
Only Mr. Wheely
doesn't know Putt Putt.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.040
Ten cars in a row
breaking the speed limit!

03:31.042 --> 03:34.607
We better get some backup and
more clamps from the station!

03:34.609 --> 03:36.473
It's race day today, ma'am.

03:36.475 --> 03:37.974
The streets are closed
for racing.

03:37.976 --> 03:39.976
It's completely legal today,
ma'am.

03:50.077 --> 03:51.474
Whoa! You okay?

03:51.476 --> 03:53.807
This is so exciting!

03:53.809 --> 03:55.908
Finally we have reached my
favorite portion of the race,

03:55.910 --> 03:59.975
which is this fantastic
tubular course in a drainpipe!

03:59.977 --> 04:02.710
This is the fun part!

04:07.443 --> 04:10.476
What happens inside,
stays inside!

04:13.676 --> 04:14.841
And the racers are inside.

04:14.843 --> 04:16.474
Who knows who will emerge

04:16.476 --> 04:17.841
as the leader at the end?

04:17.843 --> 04:20.708
In my day, the racers
just stayed on the road.

04:20.709 --> 04:22.841
I bet Joe Flo's gonna lead
the tubular course.

04:22.843 --> 04:24.608
He's doing great!

04:24.610 --> 04:26.875
He did have an accident earlier.

04:26.877 --> 04:28.542
My money is on Wheely.

04:28.544 --> 04:29.677
You're on!

04:49.510 --> 04:51.011
Whoa! What! No!

04:56.711 --> 05:00.042
Drive like a butterfly,
win like a me!

05:07.044 --> 05:10.041
Your turn to breathe my dust!

05:10.043 --> 05:12.577
Catch my drift?
Look out now!

05:18.777 --> 05:21.642
Wow! Hot stuff!

05:21.644 --> 05:24.011
And that oil's not bad either.

05:26.078 --> 05:27.509
I need a delivery.

05:27.511 --> 05:29.543
One bucket of Petro Oil Special.

05:29.545 --> 05:31.976
Sure! The name's
Wheely O'Wheels.

05:31.978 --> 05:34.009
Yeah, that Wheely O'Wheels.

05:34.011 --> 05:37.043
I know! Make sure it's waiting
at the finishing line.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.709
I'll be the one
crossing it first.

05:38.711 --> 05:40.577
Aah! Go!

05:42.678 --> 05:45.610
One Petro Oil Super Special
for O'Wheels!

05:45.612 --> 05:48.077
O'Wheels? Slap my face!

05:48.079 --> 05:49.442
That's not... Can it be?

05:49.444 --> 05:50.542
The finishing line!

05:50.544 --> 05:51.742
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

05:51.744 --> 05:54.976
This oil is for
Mr. Wheely himself!

05:54.978 --> 05:57.042
Move out of the way!
Move out of the way!

05:57.044 --> 05:58.943
Oh, man!

05:58.945 --> 06:01.475
Sorry, this one mine!

06:01.477 --> 06:02.977
And no shortcuts!

06:02.979 --> 06:05.545
No problem. Can, Boss!

06:06.778 --> 06:09.345
Mr. Wheely,
here Putt Putt come!

06:15.779 --> 06:17.642
I hate race day!

06:17.644 --> 06:20.977
What's so good about a bunch of
cars driving just a bit faster?

06:20.979 --> 06:23.443
What's so good about that?

06:23.445 --> 06:26.012
Sorry! Excuse me!
Special delivery!

06:32.846 --> 06:35.343
VIPS only, buddy.

06:35.345 --> 06:36.943
Oh, but I have VID!

06:36.945 --> 06:38.943
Very Important Delivery
for Mr. Wheely!

06:38.945 --> 06:40.477
Sure you have.

06:40.479 --> 06:41.710
All right, ladies and gents,

06:41.712 --> 06:43.644
we come to the last part
of the race,

06:43.646 --> 06:46.443
with Joe Flo and Wheely O'Wheels
still in the lead.

06:46.445 --> 06:48.878
Who's going to take
the checkered flag?

06:48.880 --> 06:50.843
I can't take this anymore!

06:50.845 --> 06:52.977
A dramatic race indeed.
Indeed, it is.

06:52.979 --> 06:56.744
And just moments away
before we crown a new champion.

06:56.746 --> 06:58.110
Putt Putt failed!

06:58.112 --> 07:00.443
Failed Merry Motors!

07:00.445 --> 07:03.610
They will take away Putt Putt's
best delivery scooter trophy!

07:03.612 --> 07:06.943
Putt Putt have to go
training again many years!

07:06.945 --> 07:08.746
Ohh!

07:10.646 --> 07:13.044
Oh! Shortcut!

07:13.046 --> 07:15.677
But Boss say no shortcut!

07:15.679 --> 07:17.978
But it's the only way!

07:21.446 --> 07:23.513
So dirty!

07:30.446 --> 07:32.713
See you later, tailgater!

07:45.647 --> 07:46.814
What? Hey!

07:47.914 --> 07:50.577
Out of my way!

07:58.580 --> 08:01.544
Holy... slip!

08:01.546 --> 08:02.912
Did he just...

08:02.914 --> 08:04.444
I think he did!

08:04.446 --> 08:05.911
Oh, no, he didn't!

08:05.913 --> 08:07.711
Momma, I think he just said...

08:07.713 --> 08:10.847
Whoa!

08:14.479 --> 08:19.478
Rail tracks ain't never
gonna replace proper roads!

08:19.480 --> 08:22.447
Oh, this ain't gonna be good!

08:28.047 --> 08:30.779
Aah! No! No! No!

08:30.781 --> 08:32.881
Front wheel lock!

08:47.547 --> 08:50.514
Mr. Wheely! What have I done?

09:22.381 --> 09:25.046
- Now where you going, son?
- Just out, Momma.

09:25.048 --> 09:27.513
No, no, no.
No son of mine is leaving

09:27.515 --> 09:30.446
without having
a proper breakfast.

09:33.015 --> 09:36.046
Downtown Gasket City.

09:36.048 --> 09:39.346
I ain't got no time for that,
Momma. I got a fare downtown.

09:39.348 --> 09:40.746
This early in the morning?

09:40.748 --> 09:44.046
Yeah, Momma. You know I gotta do
what I gotta do.

09:44.048 --> 09:45.714
I'm gonna bring in
all the cash

09:45.716 --> 09:48.046
and fix this place up
real nice for you, Momma.

09:48.048 --> 09:50.047
I appreciate that, son,

09:50.049 --> 09:53.412
but just remember
you're not what you used to be.

09:53.414 --> 09:56.113
I got that.
Don't worry.

09:56.115 --> 09:58.616
I gotta jet.
I don't wanna lose the fare.

09:59.716 --> 10:01.949
All right, son.

10:15.783 --> 10:17.479
Wassup, homie?

10:17.481 --> 10:20.047
How are you on this
glorious morning, Mr. Wheely?

10:20.049 --> 10:23.080
Wheely fed up with everyone
checking up on me.

10:23.082 --> 10:25.849
I not checking up on anyone,
just you.

10:31.482 --> 10:33.016
Hey, Mr. Wheely, wait for me.

10:38.649 --> 10:40.580
Would you stop following me?

10:40.582 --> 10:43.847
Like I told my momma, I'm just
picking up a fare in the city.

10:43.849 --> 10:46.447
Okay. Putt Putt make sure
no problem.

10:46.449 --> 10:48.347
I appreciate the concern,
Putt Putt,

10:48.349 --> 10:49.814
but I know what I'm doing.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.881
- I'm cool.
- Yeah, I know, Mr. Wheely.

10:51.883 --> 10:54.081
It's just Putt Putt so worried
about you, Mr. Wheely.

10:54.083 --> 10:57.047
Mrs. Momma said Mr. Wheely
should take care and be careful,

10:57.049 --> 10:59.514
and Putt Putt
look after Mr. Wheely.

11:07.116 --> 11:08.847
I'm... cool.

11:08.849 --> 11:12.413
Oww, oww!
You not cool, Mr. Wheely.

11:12.415 --> 11:14.017
I'm cool!

11:24.683 --> 11:27.380
Why everyone gotta be
all up in my grill?

11:27.382 --> 11:29.447
I'm totally cool. Totally!

11:29.449 --> 11:32.448
I mean, I got a junky axle,
but yeah, I'm alive.

11:32.450 --> 11:36.648
I'm still on the road.
I'm cool. So cool.

11:41.349 --> 11:44.748
Joe? Is that...
a hood job?

11:44.750 --> 11:47.581
Yo, Wheely?
Hey, look at you.

11:47.583 --> 11:51.115
You look good. New paint job?
Catch up soon!

11:51.117 --> 11:54.481
Finishing line's at
Gasket Central, boys and girls!

11:54.483 --> 11:55.782
You joining us, Wheely?

11:55.784 --> 11:57.750
Showoffs.

12:21.650 --> 12:24.549
O'Wheels, pickup's waiting
at Gasket Central.

12:24.551 --> 12:26.618
Get there in five minutes,
or you're fired.

12:31.583 --> 12:33.616
Hey, guys,
get a load of this taxi

12:33.618 --> 12:36.818
thinking his exhaust pipe
is as big as ours.

12:38.117 --> 12:40.116
No!

12:40.118 --> 12:42.883
Oh! That don't sound
too good, man.

12:42.885 --> 12:45.681
You better get an upgrade
if you wanna race with us.

12:56.718 --> 13:01.049
Why do we always have
to start shooting so early?

13:01.051 --> 13:03.083
So the city will
be quiet, darling.

13:03.085 --> 13:06.117
No paparazzi, no fans.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.849
Yeah, you're right.

13:07.851 --> 13:10.550
I'm living the dream.
I shouldn't complain.

13:12.885 --> 13:15.682
Hello, Bella speaking.

13:15.684 --> 13:18.682
- Hi, babe, it's me.
- Ben, where are you?

13:18.684 --> 13:20.383
You said you were
gonna be here.

13:20.385 --> 13:23.583
Sorry, darling. Loads to do
before my party tonight.

13:23.585 --> 13:26.750
You better not be late. I wanna
show you off to everyone.

13:26.752 --> 13:28.482
Of course I'll be there,

13:28.484 --> 13:30.050
but are you coming
to see me on set?

13:30.052 --> 13:32.551
Okay, great.
See you later at my party.

13:34.119 --> 13:37.683
Okay, everyone,
come on, get in position.

13:37.685 --> 13:39.683
Lights, lights,
check the lights!

13:39.685 --> 13:41.750
Ah, the talent.
Where is the talent?

13:41.752 --> 13:44.385
Is the talent ready?
Come on!

14:00.886 --> 14:04.051
It gives you more boom
for your zoom.

14:04.053 --> 14:06.416
Petro Oil Super Special.

14:06.418 --> 14:09.950
That was really great,
Bella, darling,

14:09.952 --> 14:12.084
but can we do it again?

14:12.086 --> 14:16.020
Only this time maybe act like
you really dig the product.

14:18.452 --> 14:20.517
Okay, places, everybody.

14:20.519 --> 14:21.984
And... action!

14:26.720 --> 14:28.519
Is this in the script?

14:35.786 --> 14:37.720
Hey, look out!

15:02.787 --> 15:04.684
Sorry. Didn't mean to do that.

15:04.686 --> 15:07.417
Are you fine?
Of course you fine.

15:07.419 --> 15:09.618
Oh, you more than fine, girl!
Mmm!

15:09.620 --> 15:11.053
Wait, don't I know you?

15:13.953 --> 15:15.819
You're Bella di Monetti,

15:15.821 --> 15:17.986
the Petro Oil
Super Special girl.

15:17.988 --> 15:19.618
More boom for my zoom.

15:19.620 --> 15:21.385
I know who I am.

15:21.387 --> 15:23.686
The question is...
who are you?

15:26.053 --> 15:28.051
Gasket Central!

15:28.053 --> 15:31.551
Bolts! I wasn't here.
You guys didn't see nothin'.

15:31.553 --> 15:32.885
Nothin' happened here,
ya hear?

15:32.887 --> 15:34.820
Sorry about the mess!

15:36.887 --> 15:40.921
Are you sure this is
the final draft of the script?

15:43.586 --> 15:45.484
Freeze. Hands up!

15:45.486 --> 15:47.086
Huh? What? Litter?

15:47.088 --> 15:50.018
That's a contravention of
highway by-way law 2274,

15:50.020 --> 15:51.619
subsection B.

15:51.621 --> 15:53.485
I'm in pursuit of
domestic refuse.

15:53.487 --> 15:55.652
Description:
small white plastic cup.

15:55.654 --> 15:57.685
Height about 15 centimeters.

15:57.687 --> 16:00.785
Ugh! I've been slimed!

16:00.787 --> 16:02.952
Holy smokes!

16:02.954 --> 16:05.352
Speeding, illegal racing,

16:05.354 --> 16:06.919
driving without due care
and attention.

16:06.921 --> 16:08.652
Oh, they're gonna be sorry

16:08.654 --> 16:11.387
they ever turned down
Sergeant Street's street.

16:14.088 --> 16:16.852
Aggravation and assault
on a police officer.

16:16.854 --> 16:19.418
Wait till I get
some clamps on them.

16:19.420 --> 16:21.052
Aha!

16:23.954 --> 16:25.688
Hey, watch it!

16:26.789 --> 16:29.619
Well, who do we have here?

16:29.621 --> 16:32.053
A taxi moonlighting as a racer.
Say no more.

16:32.055 --> 16:35.019
I know an illegal racer
when I see one.

16:35.021 --> 16:37.353
You're charged with disturbing
the peace of this early morning

16:37.355 --> 16:38.919
and for illegal racing.

16:38.921 --> 16:41.354
But... But I didn't do anything!

16:47.355 --> 16:50.886
Ma'am, your son's been charged
with illegal street racing.

16:50.888 --> 16:53.987
We haven't been able to detain
the other culprits,

16:53.989 --> 16:55.987
so we're gonna
release him on bail.

16:55.989 --> 16:58.619
But I'll tell you now,
it's going on his record.

16:58.621 --> 17:00.953
He won't be able to sneeze
in a no-sneeze zone

17:00.955 --> 17:03.720
without setting off
some red flags.

17:03.722 --> 17:06.619
Thanks, Officer. I'll be sure
to keep a close eye on him.

17:06.622 --> 17:09.953
It's "Sergeant," ma'am.
You do that now.

17:13.954 --> 17:15.722
Mm-hmm.

17:18.821 --> 17:20.887
I thought I raised you
better than that.

17:20.888 --> 17:23.819
Going off racing when you know
you're not supposed to

17:23.821 --> 17:25.587
and lying to your momma.

17:25.589 --> 17:26.587
For shame.

17:26.589 --> 17:28.586
I'm sorry, Momma.

17:28.588 --> 17:30.386
I got caught up in the moment.

17:30.388 --> 17:32.820
There were cars racing,
and I'm a racer, Momma.

17:32.822 --> 17:34.088
It's what I do.

17:34.090 --> 17:35.553
You're a car, son.

17:35.555 --> 17:37.920
You drive on the road,
you stay alive.

17:37.922 --> 17:39.556
That's what you do.

17:48.456 --> 17:50.920
Mrs. Momma very worried,
Mr. Wheely.

17:50.922 --> 17:53.888
Yeah. I messed up big time.

17:53.890 --> 17:55.587
Cafe have to close.

17:55.589 --> 17:57.486
Mrs. Momma use all money
for restaurant repair

17:57.488 --> 17:59.454
to bail Mr. Wheely.

17:59.456 --> 18:00.888
Aw, bolts.

18:00.890 --> 18:03.021
It's okay to look into past,
Mr. Wheely,

18:03.023 --> 18:05.521
but you must not stare.

18:05.523 --> 18:06.754
Say what?

18:06.756 --> 18:09.554
Fortune cookie.
Very delicious.

18:09.556 --> 18:11.289
Right.

18:14.123 --> 18:17.487
Mr. Wheely,
you know your axle no good.

18:17.489 --> 18:20.420
Please. Not again.
I am fine.

18:20.422 --> 18:22.355
One hundred percent. See?

18:22.357 --> 18:25.821
Axle fine, tires fine,
me fine.

18:25.823 --> 18:29.422
I regret I not so easily forget
what happened after accident.

18:40.356 --> 18:42.989
I been looking all over
for someone to fix Mr. Wheely.

18:42.991 --> 18:44.989
It's all my fault.
Please fix him.

18:44.991 --> 18:46.089
You my last hope.

18:49.124 --> 18:50.988
Please tell me you can help
Mr. Wheely.

18:58.791 --> 19:00.656
Excuse me.

19:03.024 --> 19:05.655
Well, he doesn't need this.

19:05.657 --> 19:07.655
Nah, we don't need that.

19:07.657 --> 19:11.057
Not this and not this.

19:13.757 --> 19:16.290
No, wait, wait!
Bring that back.

19:25.591 --> 19:28.792
Hmm. You were lucky they pulled
your friend out in time.

19:33.058 --> 19:34.989
Well, I'm missing a few parts,

19:34.991 --> 19:39.055
but I think I can just about
manage to fix him,

19:39.057 --> 19:42.856
though his racing days
are over.

19:44.791 --> 19:47.789
There must be some mistake.
Racing is what... Ugh!

19:47.791 --> 19:49.688
Mr. Wheely do.

19:49.690 --> 19:52.055
Did, kid, did. Sorry.

19:52.057 --> 19:56.355
Ah, nothing I can do about this
messed up axle right here.

19:56.357 --> 19:58.090
They don't make
this part anymore.

19:58.092 --> 20:00.090
It's discontinued.

20:00.092 --> 20:01.622
But think positive.

20:01.624 --> 20:04.456
They tell me netball
can be fun.

20:04.458 --> 20:06.992
Maybe you guys
can form a team.

20:10.958 --> 20:14.688
Putt Putt,
enough of your flashbacks.

20:14.690 --> 20:18.090
I'm just gonna check on Momma
and see if I can get any fares.

20:18.092 --> 20:20.923
Just be you.

20:20.925 --> 20:22.923
Oh! What's that?

20:22.925 --> 20:24.856
It tickles!

20:30.358 --> 20:31.489
Yo. Who dat?

20:31.491 --> 20:32.856
- Bella?
- Who?

20:32.858 --> 20:34.856
Is this Bella di Monetti's
phone?

20:36.625 --> 20:39.524
This is Bella di Monetti's
phone!

20:40.626 --> 20:43.623
Uh, no, buddy.
This is Wheely.

20:43.625 --> 20:44.823
Wheely?

20:44.825 --> 20:47.389
Yes, really.
Who dat on the line?

20:47.391 --> 20:48.923
Who are you, you mean!

20:48.925 --> 20:50.956
And what are you doing
with Bella's phone?

20:50.958 --> 20:52.956
If you know what's good for
you, then you'll return it

20:52.958 --> 20:55.422
to the Hub-Bonnet mansion.
Immediately.

20:55.424 --> 20:56.957
Problem?

20:56.959 --> 20:58.924
♪ I got Bella's phone

20:58.926 --> 21:01.357
♪ Oh, yeah
Come on, let's go ♪

21:01.359 --> 21:02.890
♪ I'ma return this phone

21:02.892 --> 21:04.724
♪ I'ma meet Bella
Uh-huh ♪

21:04.726 --> 21:07.490
♪ We gonna get married
We gonna get babies ♪

21:07.492 --> 21:09.590
♪ Oh, yeah
This is my lucky break ♪

21:09.592 --> 21:11.791
- All right!
- Yeah, Mr. Wheely,

21:11.793 --> 21:14.991
Maybe we gonna get reward,
so you can fix Momma's cafe.

21:14.993 --> 21:16.492
You do good, Mr. Wheely.

21:41.727 --> 21:43.724
You're like
all your generation, Ben,

21:43.726 --> 21:45.757
more interested
in fooling around

21:45.759 --> 21:47.757
than proper hard work.

21:47.759 --> 21:51.124
That's unfair.
I've been up since midday.

21:51.126 --> 21:54.725
Son, I know it's fun to party
like there's no tomorrow.

21:54.727 --> 21:56.490
Been there, got the tow-rack.

21:56.492 --> 21:59.357
Is this leading somewhere?

21:59.359 --> 22:01.991
You know what
turned my life around?

22:01.993 --> 22:03.558
A mini roundabout?

22:03.560 --> 22:05.525
Marriage.
Meeting your mother

22:05.527 --> 22:07.391
was the best thing
to happen to me.

22:07.393 --> 22:09.825
You need a strong lady
in your life.

22:11.060 --> 22:14.557
Ooh. I don't think so.

22:14.559 --> 22:17.957
I know so.
And Bella is perfect.

22:17.959 --> 22:21.691
I want you to announce
a marriage date immediately.

22:21.693 --> 22:24.858
Uh, I might need
to propose to her first.

22:24.860 --> 22:28.458
She's here, you're here.
Do it or else.

22:28.460 --> 22:32.358
When did she arrive?
I never saw...

22:32.360 --> 22:36.293
Now what is the latest news
on that car-napping ring?

22:42.660 --> 22:45.424
Wow! What a place.

22:45.426 --> 22:48.126
I can't believe Bella hangs out
with this kind of crowd.

22:48.128 --> 22:49.925
But how we gonna get in?

22:49.927 --> 22:51.559
Mr. Wheely, this is bad idea.

22:51.561 --> 22:53.526
But Putt Putt
also have good idea.

22:53.528 --> 22:55.992
Ha! I got it!
I'm just gonna zoom right in,

22:55.994 --> 22:58.525
sweep her off her tires,
and hand over her phone

22:58.527 --> 23:00.061
'cause I'm Wheely O'Wheels!

23:02.960 --> 23:05.661
No entry without
an invite, bozo.

23:07.360 --> 23:09.759
Okay, Mr. Wheely,
we try Putt Putt's way now?

23:09.761 --> 23:12.458
There must be a way of getting
into Snobby Towers.

23:12.460 --> 23:14.591
Oh, I got it.
If I can't go through the front,

23:14.593 --> 23:16.126
I'll go through the back.

23:16.128 --> 23:18.359
Or maybe I can go underground,
like a secret tunnel.

23:18.361 --> 23:19.926
Yeah, that's it,
secret tunnel.

23:19.928 --> 23:22.391
That security truck
ain't no match for Wheely O...

23:22.393 --> 23:24.059
Just one time, Mr. Wheely.

23:24.061 --> 23:25.424
One time you listen
to Putt Putt.

23:25.426 --> 23:27.559
Putt Putt have idea to go in.

23:27.561 --> 23:30.561
Oh. Why didn't you
just say so, man?

23:36.028 --> 23:38.826
And how's this gonna
help me again?

23:40.928 --> 23:42.893
Ah, I get it, I get it.

23:42.895 --> 23:44.793
Putt Putt, you genius.

23:44.795 --> 23:47.959
You genius,
putting on some swag on me.

23:47.961 --> 23:50.726
007. You genius!

23:50.728 --> 23:53.392
No, Mr. Wheely,
you going as waiter.

23:53.394 --> 23:56.059
What? Oh!

23:56.061 --> 23:58.826
A secret agent
pretending to be a waiter.

23:58.828 --> 23:59.861
Nice!

24:01.795 --> 24:04.893
D'oh! Somebody slap my face!

24:04.895 --> 24:08.796
Welcome to the Hub-Bonnet
mansion, Lord Archibald.

24:16.395 --> 24:19.426
Hey, are you sure
we're out of sight, carnal?

24:19.428 --> 24:21.126
Nah. I can still see you.

24:21.128 --> 24:23.760
No, knuckle-bumper,
I meant...

24:23.762 --> 24:26.393
Ah, forget it, hombre.

24:30.828 --> 24:32.595
That wasn't good!

24:45.428 --> 24:47.760
Are you losers
finally in position?

24:47.762 --> 24:49.794
Yes, Boss. You were right.

24:49.796 --> 24:52.426
This place is
crawling with money.

24:52.428 --> 24:55.060
Of course I was right.
I'm always right.

24:55.062 --> 24:56.593
Did you bring the overrider?

24:56.595 --> 24:57.861
Got it here, Boss.

24:57.863 --> 25:00.030
Good. Wait for my signal.

25:07.663 --> 25:09.027
Watch where you're going!

25:09.029 --> 25:11.761
One more car delivered
with dents or scratches,

25:11.763 --> 25:13.796
and I'll knock you
into the ocean!

25:16.796 --> 25:19.694
If the overrider works,
we can go fully automated

25:19.696 --> 25:23.462
and forget about having
these useless trucks around.

25:28.629 --> 25:29.927
Yeah, man.

25:29.929 --> 25:32.661
Where am I? Help!

25:42.663 --> 25:46.063
Okay, so just try to blend in.

25:55.429 --> 25:57.394
Ohh!

25:57.396 --> 26:00.062
Oopsy-daisy! Uh, sorry, love.

26:00.064 --> 26:01.795
Cor! Blimey!

26:01.797 --> 26:04.661
Something's not quite right
with this painting.

26:04.663 --> 26:06.761
That's better.

26:06.763 --> 26:10.796
I'm so English.
I am blending in.

26:10.798 --> 26:12.594
Hey, watch it!

26:12.596 --> 26:15.031
Fetch me another drink
and make it fast.

26:16.464 --> 26:19.662
Hey, do I look like a waiter?

26:19.664 --> 26:24.561
I mean, sorry, of course I do
because I am a waiter.

26:24.563 --> 26:27.029
Totally. Sorry, sir.

26:27.031 --> 26:29.064
I'll get you that drink.

26:40.663 --> 26:42.929
I've been trying to call you,
but you never pick up.

26:42.931 --> 26:46.562
No, I lost my phone. Sorry.

26:46.564 --> 26:48.495
Well, there's an amazing offer
on the table.

26:48.497 --> 26:50.428
Hollywood wants you.

26:50.430 --> 26:53.395
Hollywood? Me?

26:53.397 --> 26:55.362
All you gotta do is sign.

26:55.364 --> 26:59.395
I... I need time to think.
I'll call you back. Bye.

27:00.531 --> 27:01.898
- Uh...
- You there!

27:06.731 --> 27:09.696
Waiters aren't allowed
up here!

27:09.698 --> 27:10.897
I'm a...

27:10.899 --> 27:12.096
An imposter?

27:12.098 --> 27:13.829
Security!

27:13.831 --> 27:16.063
Oh, what are you doing here?

27:16.065 --> 27:18.096
I just dropped by
with your ph...

27:18.098 --> 27:19.829
I said Security!

27:19.831 --> 27:22.630
Wait! No!
He saved my life today.

27:22.632 --> 27:25.362
He's a lowlife
who doesn't belong here.

27:25.364 --> 27:28.398
- You, take this trash out.
- Sir!

27:30.898 --> 27:33.062
- Was that really necessary?
- Yes.

27:33.064 --> 27:35.630
Now, can you please
at least look

27:35.632 --> 27:37.130
as though you want to be here?

27:37.132 --> 27:39.495
I'm about to announce
our wedding day.

27:39.497 --> 27:41.965
Our what?
Are you crazy?

27:42.965 --> 27:43.965
Hey!

27:45.532 --> 27:47.999
I'm sorry.

27:51.732 --> 27:53.562
And stay out!

27:53.564 --> 27:57.063
Hey, you know who I am?
I'm Wheely O'Wheels, buddy!

27:57.065 --> 27:58.331
Who?

28:00.099 --> 28:04.364
No one can say I didn't
give it my best shot.

28:04.366 --> 28:06.464
- Did you see her?
- I saw her.

28:06.466 --> 28:08.030
She's getting married.

28:08.032 --> 28:10.030
Mr. Wheely, really wonderful!

28:10.032 --> 28:11.363
Success finally!

28:11.365 --> 28:13.632
To somebody else.

28:17.665 --> 28:20.863
Wait, Mr. Wheely.
You want to talk about this?

28:20.865 --> 28:22.997
No, thanks, Putt Putt.

28:22.999 --> 28:25.898
But I gotta do some thinking.
Solo.

28:25.900 --> 28:28.131
"Keep eyes on road
and mind on future."

28:28.133 --> 28:30.364
I once read on fortune cookie.

28:30.366 --> 28:32.633
Maybe things not so bad
as you think.

28:35.466 --> 28:37.531
Sometimes they worse.

28:40.665 --> 28:41.799
It's time.

28:47.599 --> 28:49.866
Sir, Miss Bella just left.

28:57.633 --> 28:59.066
Hello?

29:05.466 --> 29:07.064
Hey, Bella.

29:07.066 --> 29:10.299
Brad, the party is
back the other way.

29:11.599 --> 29:15.132
So why not have one right here?

29:15.134 --> 29:17.697
Maybe you and I could
go for a drive?

29:17.699 --> 29:21.064
There is no you and I, Brad.

29:26.733 --> 29:28.597
Come on, Bella.

29:28.599 --> 29:30.998
I'm just as shiny
and solid as Ben.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.600
Why don't we hook up
and settle down?

29:36.834 --> 29:38.865
I know someone who wants
to settle down. Ben!

29:38.867 --> 29:42.132
I'm sure you two will look
pretty solid together.

29:42.134 --> 29:44.764
What? No, no, no. I'm not into
something like that.

29:44.766 --> 29:48.765
I know Ben is rich
and handsome and buff.

29:48.767 --> 29:50.632
Press the red button, carnal!

29:50.634 --> 29:54.333
But I'm more into someone
like you, Bella, baby.

29:57.833 --> 30:00.899
Whoa! Whoa! Hey! Hey!

30:00.901 --> 30:03.665
Stop this right now!

30:03.667 --> 30:06.665
Me stop? Never.

30:15.034 --> 30:18.532
In 200 meters,
take the first exit.

30:18.534 --> 30:20.398
No, no, no!

30:20.400 --> 30:21.867
Stop this!

30:23.001 --> 30:24.500
Where you taking me?

30:25.600 --> 30:28.698
Help. Help!

30:30.102 --> 30:32.767
You really shouldn't drink
and drive, Brad.

30:34.901 --> 30:37.532
Follow after Bella.
Tell me where she's gone.

30:37.534 --> 30:39.068
Yes, sir.

31:32.701 --> 31:35.000
Car Wars.

31:35.002 --> 31:38.033
For the 86th time. Great.

31:38.035 --> 31:40.733
Hey, can I get your autograph?

31:40.735 --> 31:41.766
You know me?

31:41.768 --> 31:44.067
Yeah! Wheely O'Wheels.

31:44.069 --> 31:46.100
I'd recognize those headlights
anywhere.

31:46.102 --> 31:47.734
Really?

31:47.736 --> 31:51.466
Yeah, and your
registration number.

31:53.401 --> 31:56.369
Thanks. Nice to meet you.

32:04.069 --> 32:05.667
Excuse me.

32:05.669 --> 32:08.633
Can you please...
I can't see the...

32:15.069 --> 32:18.367
Miss Di Monetti,
what are you doing here?

32:18.369 --> 32:20.734
It's Bella.
And I'm watching a movie,

32:20.736 --> 32:22.635
with this being a cinema
and all.

32:22.637 --> 32:26.034
Hilarious as well as cute.
I'm Wheely.

32:26.036 --> 32:28.002
Are you okay to share?

32:28.004 --> 32:30.034
Okay? I'm ecstatic, baby,

32:30.036 --> 32:31.834
Ec-sta-tic!

32:31.836 --> 32:33.501
Keep it down, buddy!

32:33.503 --> 32:35.568
I'm trying to watch
the movie here!

32:38.502 --> 32:41.801
I am your father.

32:41.803 --> 32:43.667
No! It can't be!

32:43.669 --> 32:47.067
Accept the fact, Roadrider.

32:47.069 --> 32:49.967
So what was it you wanted
to speak to me about earlier?

32:49.969 --> 32:52.935
I just wanted to say sorry
for ruining your photo shoot

32:52.937 --> 32:54.835
and to give you this.

32:54.837 --> 32:59.034
Thanks! I was looking for it
everywhere!

33:03.069 --> 33:05.935
Hey, you wanna grab a bite
after the movie?

33:05.937 --> 33:08.500
It's quite late.

33:08.502 --> 33:11.468
It's not far.
Good service guaranteed.

33:11.470 --> 33:13.601
The lady who runs the place
likes me.

33:13.603 --> 33:17.035
Oh, a ladies' man.
I should've guessed.

33:17.037 --> 33:19.336
Shall we go now?

33:55.370 --> 33:58.371
Here we are.
Home, sweet home.

34:00.970 --> 34:03.569
Bella meet Momma.
Momma meet Bella.

34:03.571 --> 34:05.569
The lady who likes you.

34:05.571 --> 34:07.803
Wheely, you should've called.

34:07.805 --> 34:09.768
Good to meet you, honey.

34:09.770 --> 34:12.304
Come on, let's head inside.

34:15.905 --> 34:19.103
Wow. You have a lot
of photos of Wheely.

34:19.105 --> 34:21.103
Well, my baby always wins.

34:21.105 --> 34:24.369
So I see.
I don't follow sports much.

34:24.371 --> 34:27.435
Me neither, honey,
unless Wheely is involved.

34:27.437 --> 34:31.136
So you two are
somethin'-somethin', hmm?

34:31.138 --> 34:33.735
Momma, we went to a movie.

34:33.737 --> 34:35.469
Your father and I
went to a movie.

34:35.471 --> 34:37.069
That's how it starts, son.

34:37.071 --> 34:39.502
Do I need to be thinking
about ordering confetti?

34:39.504 --> 34:41.569
Getting a makeover
for the big day?

34:41.571 --> 34:43.936
We're just friends,
Mrs. O'Wheels.

34:43.938 --> 34:47.071
I already have a boyfriend.

34:48.539 --> 34:50.539
And he's a millionaire.

34:51.705 --> 34:53.938
Not that money is everything.

35:03.438 --> 35:07.402
Yes, sir. Miss Di Monetti is
still inside the cafe with him.

35:07.404 --> 35:11.006
What? Bring her back here
immediately!

35:16.806 --> 35:20.402
Aren't those stars amazing?

35:20.404 --> 35:24.039
Yeah, amazing.

35:25.906 --> 35:29.037
So how come you swapped racing
for being a taxi?

35:29.039 --> 35:31.904
I had no choice.
There was a crash.

35:31.906 --> 35:33.837
I got smashed up pretty bad.

35:33.839 --> 35:36.537
Oh. It sounds like giving up
was a good move.

35:36.539 --> 35:38.970
Racing is dangerous.

35:38.972 --> 35:40.870
So are people trying
to film commercials

35:40.872 --> 35:42.937
in the middle of a racetrack.

35:42.939 --> 35:47.571
I'm serious.
I wouldn't want you to get hurt.

35:47.573 --> 35:50.436
I mean, it would
upset your momma.

35:50.438 --> 35:52.070
Oh!

35:52.072 --> 35:54.403
Clumsy. Don't mind me.

35:54.405 --> 35:56.572
I'm just passing through.

35:58.739 --> 36:01.571
I already promised Momma
I'd never race again.

36:01.573 --> 36:03.004
And I won't.

36:03.006 --> 36:05.503
I'll deal with it.

36:05.505 --> 36:09.436
Hey, Bella, I'd really like it
if we could do this again.

36:09.438 --> 36:12.471
Why not? I do like a car
who keeps his promises.

36:12.473 --> 36:15.640
You make him promise
not to race ever again!

36:23.739 --> 36:26.771
For you, I promise.
Trust me.

36:26.773 --> 36:28.971
I got a feeling that
out of all my crushes...

36:28.973 --> 36:30.604
I mean crashes...

36:30.606 --> 36:33.073
today's is gonna be
the one I remember.

36:39.506 --> 36:41.938
Mr. Hub-Bonnet
is waiting, miss.

36:41.940 --> 36:43.671
Okay, I'm coming.

36:43.673 --> 36:45.738
See you again, I hope.

36:45.740 --> 36:47.604
There's always hope, child.

36:47.606 --> 36:49.505
You come back
anytime you like, hear?

36:49.507 --> 36:52.071
Bye, Mrs. O'Wheels.
Keep him safe.

36:52.073 --> 36:55.907
Oh, you just
call me Momma, girl.

37:00.840 --> 37:03.674
I'm in love.

37:10.941 --> 37:14.873
What did I tell you about
being careful with the cars?

37:17.073 --> 37:18.672
On the count of three.

37:18.674 --> 37:19.839
Three, two...

37:19.841 --> 37:21.705
Huh?

37:28.674 --> 37:29.939
Yes, Boss?

37:29.941 --> 37:33.006
I asked for an Italian,
not an American!

37:33.008 --> 37:36.405
Everyone knows Italians
are worth more than Americans.

37:36.407 --> 37:39.106
Oh, we did what
you said to do, Boss.

37:39.108 --> 37:41.372
The overrider must be broken.

37:41.374 --> 37:43.672
The only thing
that will be broken is you,

37:43.674 --> 37:45.605
if you don't fix this mess.

37:45.607 --> 37:48.405
I saw the overrider working
perfectly with my own eyes

37:48.407 --> 37:50.372
when I first tested it.

37:50.374 --> 37:53.139
Well, the American's
on his way, Boss.

37:53.141 --> 37:54.772
You still want him?

37:54.774 --> 37:58.140
Send him over. You guys
track that Italian down.

37:58.142 --> 38:03.673
Scratch that! Stay put, and I'll
track the Italian myself.

38:03.675 --> 38:06.639
3, 2, 1.

38:07.909 --> 38:10.574
Hah. That was smokin'.

38:31.141 --> 38:34.505
Ben? What are you doing here?
How did you get in?

38:34.507 --> 38:36.840
Bella, where have you been?

38:36.842 --> 38:39.839
Out. I have my own life too,
remember?

38:39.841 --> 38:41.673
I'm sorry. I don't know
how to say this,

38:41.675 --> 38:43.506
but I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

38:43.508 --> 38:45.873
What do you need
to think for, love?

38:45.875 --> 38:47.673
You have me to do that.

38:47.675 --> 38:49.541
Everything's going to be fine.

38:49.543 --> 38:52.573
All this security's
freaking you out. I get that.

38:52.575 --> 38:54.573
- You do?
- Yes!

38:54.575 --> 38:57.573
On our honeymoon,
we'll be on a private island,

38:57.575 --> 38:58.873
the only guests.

38:58.875 --> 39:00.474
Peace and quiet guaranteed.

39:00.476 --> 39:02.873
Honeymoon?
When was this decided?

39:02.875 --> 39:05.107
Though we'll need bodyguards,
of course, and a chef or two.

39:05.109 --> 39:08.074
And my valet,
my stylist, naturally, and...

39:08.076 --> 39:11.973
You know what? It's late,
and I really need to rest now.

39:11.975 --> 39:14.409
- Good night, Ben.
- Bella!

39:15.809 --> 39:19.439
So tell me about
this taxi she met.

39:19.441 --> 39:21.573
I can still hear you, Ben!

39:27.076 --> 39:30.507
Are you coming to Hollywood?
I need a decision soon.

39:30.509 --> 39:32.841
It's your dream,
and it's here waiting for you.

39:32.843 --> 39:35.342
All you have to do
is be brave.

39:39.743 --> 39:41.574
Hey. Hey!

39:41.576 --> 39:43.374
I don't like heights!

39:43.376 --> 39:46.008
Aw, man.
I don't like the lows.

39:46.010 --> 39:49.741
I'm an American citizen!
Hey, I know my rights, man!

39:49.743 --> 39:52.541
You just need to relax, man.

39:52.543 --> 39:55.074
We've only got one spot left
on Crank.

39:55.076 --> 39:57.142
I want the best for the last.

39:57.144 --> 39:59.440
I want the Italian!

39:59.442 --> 40:01.076
Hmm.

40:06.143 --> 40:10.707
Yeah, I know.

40:16.943 --> 40:18.010
Huh?

40:24.609 --> 40:25.876
Aah!

40:26.910 --> 40:29.408
Hello? Anyone out there?

40:29.410 --> 40:31.441
This is a message
from Mr. Hub-Bonnet.

40:31.443 --> 40:34.009
You're delivering mail
at two in the morning?

40:34.011 --> 40:36.541
Mr. Hub-Bonnet requests
your participation

40:36.543 --> 40:39.408
in a race through the streets,
just you and him.

40:39.410 --> 40:43.041
If you win, you will receive
one million in cash.

40:43.043 --> 40:44.708
Say what?

40:44.710 --> 40:48.809
If you win, you will receive
one million in cash.

40:48.811 --> 40:51.909
Mr. Hub-Bonnet will explain the
full details at the start line.

40:51.911 --> 40:54.975
Gasket City clock tower,
5 a.m.

40:54.977 --> 40:56.842
Nuh-uh. Sorry, buddy.

40:56.844 --> 40:59.075
Tell your chief I'm retired.
No can do.

40:59.077 --> 41:02.775
One million
in cash, cash, cash.

41:02.777 --> 41:06.475
Uh, I'm retired, buddy.

41:06.477 --> 41:10.143
One million
in cash, cash, cash.

41:10.145 --> 41:13.777
Now, why you gotta repeat "cash"
so many times?

41:36.978 --> 41:38.078
Whew!

42:03.145 --> 42:06.442
Thanks for coming, Putt Putt.
I got no one else to call.

42:06.444 --> 42:09.943
You trust him, but still,
please keep eyes open.

42:09.945 --> 42:11.609
Yeah? What you gonna do

42:11.611 --> 42:13.509
if someone offered you
a million in cash?

42:13.511 --> 42:15.410
And that money
would be good for Momma.

42:15.412 --> 42:18.509
I mean, I gotta pay her back for
the fixes and the bail, don't I?

42:18.511 --> 42:20.376
I gotta fix my axle, don't I?

42:20.378 --> 42:23.044
Do not mistake temptation
for opportunity, Mr. Wheely.

42:23.046 --> 42:26.410
No chance you can beat him.
He got power of six horses.

42:26.412 --> 42:29.110
Wait a sec, Putt Putt.

42:29.112 --> 42:30.844
Who says I gotta race?

42:30.846 --> 42:33.011
Ain't nobody said nothing
about taking shortcuts.

42:33.013 --> 42:35.111
And that's what I'm doing:
taking shortcuts.

42:37.013 --> 42:39.810
We will race
from this clock tower

42:39.812 --> 42:43.010
to the foot
of Gasket City Towers.

42:43.012 --> 42:45.044
Winner takes all.

42:45.046 --> 42:49.077
I figured you as more of
a couch-carburetor than a racer.

42:49.079 --> 42:52.776
I might not be a racer,
but I always win.

42:52.778 --> 42:55.777
Just get ready to pay up.
You goin' down.

42:57.379 --> 42:58.677
Wait a minute.

42:58.679 --> 43:01.577
What happens if you win?
Not that you will.

43:01.579 --> 43:04.410
Well, if I win,

43:04.412 --> 43:06.911
you'll stay away
from my girlfriend.

43:06.913 --> 43:11.477
Putt Putt have greasy feeling
about this greasy situation.

43:43.713 --> 43:46.410
Now, there's one good thing
about being a taxi:

43:46.412 --> 43:48.880
We know shortcuts
no one else knows.

43:55.580 --> 43:57.446
Oops! My bad!

43:58.680 --> 44:00.880
Oops! My bad!

44:28.814 --> 44:32.748
Hang in there, Wheely.
Almost there.

44:34.080 --> 44:37.511
Huh? One million
in cash, cash, cash

44:37.513 --> 44:38.878
is all mine!

44:38.880 --> 44:41.412
Yeah, I win!

44:41.414 --> 44:43.512
Weird. I always figured
my first million

44:43.514 --> 44:45.612
might be a little harder
to earn.

44:45.614 --> 44:46.979
Stay right where you are.

44:46.981 --> 44:49.846
Aw, bolts, not the cops!

44:49.848 --> 44:52.979
You! Oh, you just don't
learn your lesson, do you?

44:52.981 --> 44:54.746
I let you go,
and next minute,

44:54.748 --> 44:57.646
you go and break the law
big time again.

44:57.648 --> 45:00.479
I know how it looks like,
but this wasn't my idea.

45:00.481 --> 45:02.478
It was a challenge.
It was...

45:02.480 --> 45:03.846
Hello, Sergeant.

45:03.848 --> 45:05.879
It was I who took
the liberty to call you

45:05.881 --> 45:10.512
and inform you of this
preposterous law-breaking event.

45:10.514 --> 45:11.979
What? You lie!

45:11.981 --> 45:14.113
You sent your goon over
to ask me for a race

45:14.115 --> 45:17.913
and promised me a million
in cash, cash, cash if I won.

45:17.915 --> 45:19.546
Absurd!

45:19.548 --> 45:23.113
I mean, do I look like
a common street racer?

45:23.115 --> 45:24.913
I am so sorry, sir.

45:24.915 --> 45:27.913
These young hooligans will say
anything to avoid justice.

45:27.915 --> 45:29.846
I trust he won't do that.

45:29.848 --> 45:34.947
Oh, no. He's going to be off
the road for a very long time.

45:34.949 --> 45:38.512
Face it. You and me,
we're not in the same league.

45:38.514 --> 45:40.380
Don't even dream
that Bella would ever want

45:40.382 --> 45:42.746
anything to do
with the likes of you.

45:42.748 --> 45:46.582
You're a loser, and you always
will be one, taxi boy.

45:51.882 --> 45:56.079
It's reckless wrecks like you
that make this job worthwhile.

45:56.081 --> 45:57.814
You shouldn't have let him go.

45:57.816 --> 45:59.713
He's the one
who set this all up.

45:59.715 --> 46:02.080
- He's to blame.
- Save it for your lawyer!

46:02.082 --> 46:03.546
If you can afford one.

46:03.548 --> 46:05.580
Lawyer?
Yeah, of course.

46:05.582 --> 46:08.413
I gotta make a call.
I'm entitled to one call, no?

46:08.415 --> 46:09.914
I've seen it in the movies.

46:09.916 --> 46:12.613
Yeah, well, this is real life.
Make it quick.

46:12.615 --> 46:14.080
Better call your momma.

46:14.082 --> 46:16.816
But she can't get you out
so easy this time.

46:21.415 --> 46:23.980
- Hello?
- Bella, it's Wheely.

46:23.982 --> 46:25.680
Hey, Wheely. What's up?

46:25.682 --> 46:27.680
Sorry, but I have
to talk to you.

46:27.682 --> 46:29.680
Are you all right?
What's wrong?

46:29.682 --> 46:32.947
There was a race.
I have to go away for a while.

46:32.949 --> 46:36.081
A race?
Wheely, you promised.

46:36.083 --> 46:38.880
I... I needed
the prize money for...

46:38.882 --> 46:42.080
You did this for money,
after all we talked about?

46:42.082 --> 46:44.681
Wheely, I'm sorry.
I thought you were different.

46:44.683 --> 46:46.948
But it was a fix.
Ben had...

46:46.950 --> 46:49.015
And I needed the money
for Momma.

46:49.017 --> 46:52.680
Okay, that's enough. Your friend
here has been caught taking part

46:52.682 --> 46:54.713
in illegal racing, fly-posting,

46:54.715 --> 46:56.581
driving with
a defective rear mirror,

46:56.583 --> 46:57.714
sobbing like a baby...

46:57.716 --> 47:00.048
Excuse me? Who is this?

47:00.050 --> 47:03.815
I am Sergeant Street from
the Gasket City Police Station,

47:03.817 --> 47:05.915
and your friend here is
an illegal street racer,

47:05.917 --> 47:09.781
and he'll be going to prison
for a long time.

47:09.783 --> 47:11.650
Let's go!

47:16.150 --> 47:19.648
Are you coming to Hollywood?
I need a decision soon.

47:19.650 --> 47:22.015
It's your dream,
and it's here waiting for you.

47:22.017 --> 47:24.550
All you have to do
is be brave.

47:27.850 --> 47:30.081
Hmm.

47:30.083 --> 47:33.447
Why is it so darn hard to say
which photo I look best in?

47:33.449 --> 47:36.081
Maybe I'll just
put them all in.

47:36.083 --> 47:40.481
Ben, there's no easy way
to say this, but it's over.

47:40.483 --> 47:44.415
Okay. I think I know
where this is coming from,

47:44.417 --> 47:45.881
but you mustn't waste time

47:45.883 --> 47:48.081
worrying about
that loser of a taxi.

47:48.083 --> 47:50.514
It's not that.
I'm going to Hollywood.

47:50.516 --> 47:53.049
I've been offered
the lead role in a movie.

47:53.051 --> 47:54.448
What? You can't act.

47:54.450 --> 47:55.981
I'm sorry?

47:55.983 --> 48:00.515
Daddy will disinherit me
if I don't marry somebody.

48:00.517 --> 48:02.481
I-I mean you.

48:02.483 --> 48:06.016
You'll find someone else.
It shouldn't be too hard.

48:06.018 --> 48:08.682
I know that deep down you're not
the arrogant, emotionless,

48:08.684 --> 48:10.948
self-preening idiot
everyone says you are.

48:10.950 --> 48:14.149
Thanks, I think.

48:14.151 --> 48:18.549
But you and I aren't soulmates,
Ben, and we never will be.

48:18.551 --> 48:22.816
Maybe not, but there's a life
of luxury here for you.

48:22.818 --> 48:25.082
That isn't the life I want.

48:25.084 --> 48:27.382
You're not the one I love.

48:27.384 --> 48:29.416
You're insane!

48:29.418 --> 48:32.384
Please, just think this through.

48:43.751 --> 48:46.484
Uh, I am here for visit time.

48:59.652 --> 49:02.750
You wouldn't
have landed in here

49:02.752 --> 49:05.952
if you'd just listened to me
and gone left instead of right.

49:20.952 --> 49:21.950
Huh?

49:21.952 --> 49:23.650
Treasured friend!

49:23.652 --> 49:25.082
Hey, Putt Putt.

49:25.084 --> 49:28.883
You have no idea
how happy I am to see you.

49:28.885 --> 49:30.516
Don't worry, Mr. Wheely.

49:30.518 --> 49:32.083
Two days from now,
tomorrow will be yesterday.

49:32.085 --> 49:33.516
It will be okay.

49:33.518 --> 49:35.750
Yeah, well,
two days from now,

49:35.752 --> 49:38.383
I'm still gonna be
sitting here.

49:38.385 --> 49:41.117
So how did Momma take it?

49:41.119 --> 49:45.150
I think Mr. Wheely
have much apologizing to do.

49:47.585 --> 49:49.383
Daytime visit is now over.

49:49.385 --> 49:52.151
Visiting hours for night visits
is from 6 to 8 pm.

49:52.153 --> 49:54.783
Cheer up, Mr. Wheely.
This is for you.

49:54.785 --> 49:58.484
Petro Oil Super Special.
More boom for your zoom.

49:58.486 --> 50:02.385
Hey! No gifts for prisoners.
I'll take that.

50:04.685 --> 50:07.018
Ah! Nice!

50:07.020 --> 50:08.553
Out!

50:51.553 --> 50:53.517
You're making more noise
than my ex-wife.

50:53.519 --> 50:55.953
It's not me, man.

51:00.720 --> 51:02.450
I'm right here.

51:02.452 --> 51:04.319
Turn around, you losers!

51:06.653 --> 51:08.951
Sorry, jefe.
We never saw you.

51:08.953 --> 51:11.618
Are you sure
it's the Italian?

51:11.620 --> 51:14.151
Not really,
but I can ask if you want.

51:14.153 --> 51:15.852
Yes, it is, Boss.

51:15.854 --> 51:17.852
We're ready to reel her in
anytime you want.

51:17.854 --> 51:18.952
You say the word.

51:18.954 --> 51:21.784
Okay, I'm saying it now.

51:21.786 --> 51:23.119
The word.

51:23.121 --> 51:24.919
Reel her in!

51:35.154 --> 51:36.554
Momma?

51:39.487 --> 51:41.087
Anyone here?

51:42.954 --> 51:46.919
Huh? Bella?
Is that you, baby?

51:46.921 --> 51:49.785
I was just passing
and thought I'd...

51:49.787 --> 51:51.385
Are you okay?

51:51.387 --> 51:54.585
Not really.
You know Wheely ain't here.

51:54.587 --> 51:57.685
If only he kept his promise
to us both.

51:57.687 --> 52:01.085
Why did he do it, Momma?
Why did he agree to race?

52:01.087 --> 52:04.451
I suppose you can't take the
racer out of a car like Wheely.

52:04.453 --> 52:07.652
I've tried.
It's a part of who he is.

52:07.654 --> 52:09.685
I guess.
Sorry for keeping you.

52:09.687 --> 52:12.085
I should get going.
I've a plane to catch.

52:12.087 --> 52:13.553
A plane?

52:13.555 --> 52:15.020
I've got a job in Hollywood.

52:15.022 --> 52:16.820
I'll be away a long time.

52:16.822 --> 52:18.788
Can you say goodbye to Wheely
for me, Momma?

52:21.620 --> 52:23.452
I just can't face him
right now.

52:23.454 --> 52:26.419
My broken engine
can't take it no more.

52:26.421 --> 52:29.020
You can go, child.
You go.

52:29.022 --> 52:31.453
All right, Momma.
Goodbye.

52:35.088 --> 52:38.488
Maybe there's time
for one last goodbye.

52:42.122 --> 52:45.321
Drive 1,200 meters
to join main highway.

52:55.755 --> 52:57.886
Target on the move.

53:04.889 --> 53:05.989
Hey!

53:06.988 --> 53:08.955
Destination: Detour.

53:17.454 --> 53:20.087
Miss Bella very good
at driving backwards.

53:20.089 --> 53:23.556
Help! I'm out of control!

53:26.522 --> 53:27.956
I take back my words!

53:43.489 --> 53:45.589
No! Help!

54:15.723 --> 54:17.720
Okay, don't be nervous.

54:17.722 --> 54:19.924
They're just regular Joes
like me.

54:20.957 --> 54:22.122
Except maybe him...

54:22.124 --> 54:23.856
and him.

54:27.156 --> 54:30.387
Who am I kidding?
These guys ain't like me.

54:30.389 --> 54:34.456
They're bank robbers,
arsonists, car-nappers or...

54:35.523 --> 54:38.421
Much, much worse.

54:38.423 --> 54:41.621
You see that guy over there?

54:41.623 --> 54:43.922
He used to be a politician!

54:45.857 --> 54:49.055
Something tells me prison and I
ain't gonna get along too well.

54:49.057 --> 54:51.022
Prisoner Wheely O'Wheels.

54:51.024 --> 54:52.888
- Yo?
- You got a visitor.

54:52.890 --> 54:54.555
Now, who'd want to visit me?

54:54.557 --> 54:56.588
Putt Putt?
He just visited me.

54:56.590 --> 55:00.388
Momma? Nah. She's probably
disowned me by now.

55:00.390 --> 55:01.423
Bella?

55:03.657 --> 55:05.755
Okay, Wheely, come on now.

55:05.757 --> 55:07.822
You da man with the plan.

55:07.824 --> 55:09.422
The king of da rims.

55:09.424 --> 55:10.955
Nobody is smoother.

55:10.957 --> 55:12.857
You are the number one mover.

55:16.090 --> 55:19.655
Hey, baby, I'm so, so...

55:19.657 --> 55:21.389
- Putt Putt?
- Baby?

55:21.391 --> 55:23.389
What are you doing here again?
Where's Bella?

55:23.391 --> 55:24.888
Putt Putt?

55:24.890 --> 55:26.988
She driving backwards on road,
like this.

55:26.990 --> 55:29.454
Huh? What?

55:29.456 --> 55:31.089
She say she cannot
control herself.

55:31.091 --> 55:33.389
Help! Help! Aah!

55:33.391 --> 55:34.721
What you saying?

55:34.723 --> 55:36.855
I think she been car-napped
Mr. Wheely.

55:36.857 --> 55:38.955
- Are you sure, Putt Putt?
- I was there.

55:38.957 --> 55:41.056
It's sure as the sun shines
in the day

55:41.058 --> 55:42.989
and the stars come out
at night.

55:42.991 --> 55:46.056
Sometimes the stars don't
come out. Anyway, she gone.

55:46.058 --> 55:49.522
Oh, no. No, no, no!
I need to find her.

55:49.524 --> 55:52.689
I have to find her.
I gotta get out of here.

55:52.691 --> 55:55.823
Do you know who took her?
I mean, what did you see?

55:55.825 --> 55:57.889
Describe him.

55:57.891 --> 56:00.756
Some mean-looking truck
with Torque Town number plates.

56:00.758 --> 56:04.791
Torque Town? No way.
This gets worse.

56:08.858 --> 56:11.557
You gotta bust me
out of here, buddy.

56:11.559 --> 56:13.889
Why you think I come?

56:13.891 --> 56:16.455
Putt Putt to control.
Do you read me?

56:16.457 --> 56:18.990
Control to Putt Putt. Yes!

56:18.992 --> 56:20.455
Package is ready to go.

56:20.457 --> 56:21.789
Why you whisper?

56:21.791 --> 56:23.425
Shh. Over.

56:44.159 --> 56:46.556
All right, folks,
play time's over.

56:46.558 --> 56:48.059
Back into your cells.

57:09.792 --> 57:12.057
Are you sure about this,
Putt Putt?

57:12.059 --> 57:14.090
No, but we must try, yes?

57:14.092 --> 57:15.992
You bet.

57:24.725 --> 57:27.624
Hey, I warned you last time.

57:27.626 --> 57:29.724
No gifts for prisoners.

57:29.726 --> 57:33.093
I'll have to confiscate this.

57:34.826 --> 57:39.090
Hey, that tastes kinda...
kinda weird.

57:39.092 --> 57:43.724
You like stay around, get girl,
win races, have nice life?

57:43.726 --> 57:45.657
Sure, but...

57:45.659 --> 57:47.827
Then take cover. Now!

58:04.827 --> 58:07.991
And that is why you don't mix
diesel with petrol.

58:07.993 --> 58:12.091
And kerosene and benzene
and water and...

58:12.093 --> 58:14.558
What is the meaning of this?

58:14.560 --> 58:17.125
Do you know how many regulations
you just broke?

58:17.127 --> 58:19.026
Under Section 72, Code 6B,

58:19.028 --> 58:21.092
underage trucks are
not allowed to smoke.

58:21.094 --> 58:23.860
What have you got to say
for yourself, young man?

58:25.927 --> 58:27.825
Attention, all units.

58:27.827 --> 58:29.892
There has been a riot
at Gasket City Prison.

58:29.894 --> 58:31.928
Requesting all units to backup.

58:39.960 --> 58:42.158
A prison riot.
This is it.

58:42.160 --> 58:44.759
One last chance
for Sergeant Street

58:44.761 --> 58:46.424
to go out with a bang.

58:50.960 --> 58:53.991
Yes! Two tickets to freedom,
please.

58:53.993 --> 58:56.391
That's right, Mr. Wheely.
We shall be free like...

58:56.393 --> 58:57.961
like, uh, butterflies!

59:04.494 --> 59:05.828
Go, go, go!

59:07.661 --> 59:09.859
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

59:09.861 --> 59:12.026
You are too large.
Too large!

59:12.028 --> 59:13.625
Ow! Ow!

59:13.627 --> 59:15.692
Ugh!

59:15.694 --> 59:18.392
Please tell me
you have a plan B.

59:18.394 --> 59:21.458
Plan B? No.
I was anticipating success.

59:21.460 --> 59:23.492
This is not good.
This is not good.

59:24.794 --> 59:27.126
It's getting dark.
Save yourself.

59:27.128 --> 59:29.059
Tell Momma that I love her.

59:29.061 --> 59:32.725
Putt Putt, you're my brother
from another mother and father.

59:32.727 --> 59:34.527
Tell Bella that I...

59:37.528 --> 59:39.761
They don't call me Wheely
for nothin'.

59:42.460 --> 59:43.660
Ohh!

59:43.662 --> 59:45.659
Too slow.

59:45.661 --> 59:47.160
Ow!

59:47.162 --> 59:49.493
Stop! Police!

59:49.495 --> 59:51.562
You guys get out of here.

59:58.460 --> 01:00:01.860
I'm free!

01:00:07.428 --> 01:00:09.027
That sound no good.

01:00:09.029 --> 01:00:11.693
Ha ha! All is well.

01:00:11.695 --> 01:00:13.595
Rest of you please to follow
Putt Putt.

01:00:17.929 --> 01:00:19.960
They escaped into the tunnels.

01:00:28.029 --> 01:00:31.493
Thanks, guys. I wouldn't be here
without your help.

01:00:31.495 --> 01:00:33.626
Now scram before the cops
figure out who you are.

01:00:33.628 --> 01:00:35.094
So where you go now?

01:00:35.096 --> 01:00:37.494
To Torque Town...
to find Bella.

01:00:37.496 --> 01:00:39.962
Then I will come too.

01:01:00.763 --> 01:01:03.161
Powering up
the delta ray scanners.

01:01:03.163 --> 01:01:07.127
Time to process
our latest guest.

01:01:07.129 --> 01:01:09.661
What do you mean, process?

01:01:09.663 --> 01:01:11.629
Move it!

01:01:16.795 --> 01:01:18.961
Engine: 70,000.

01:01:18.963 --> 01:01:20.994
Chassis: 90,000.

01:01:20.996 --> 01:01:23.494
Upholstery: 30,000.

01:01:23.496 --> 01:01:27.427
CD Fifty Greatest Love Songs:
one dollar.

01:01:27.429 --> 01:01:28.894
- Ha ha!
- What the...

01:01:28.896 --> 01:01:31.527
That is not mine.
I bought it for... That is...

01:01:31.529 --> 01:01:33.161
Listen, are you quite finished?

01:01:33.163 --> 01:01:38.395
Total profit of vehicle:
$190,001

01:01:38.397 --> 01:01:39.528
Scan ended.

01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:40.994
Excuse me?

01:01:40.996 --> 01:01:43.929
Ha ha! Excellent!

01:01:43.931 --> 01:01:46.627
Take her to the holding area,

01:01:46.629 --> 01:01:49.828
and careful not to scratch
the paintwork.

01:01:49.830 --> 01:01:51.861
Don't you dare touch me.

01:01:51.863 --> 01:01:57.062
Ooh! Feisty like a chili.
Enchi-ladies first.

01:01:57.064 --> 01:02:00.062
This enchi-lady is gonna
make us money, Boss.

01:02:00.064 --> 01:02:02.395
True, but I think
we'll get double

01:02:02.397 --> 01:02:04.996
if we sell her
piece-by-piece.

01:02:24.497 --> 01:02:26.862
How are we gonna
find Bella in time?

01:02:26.864 --> 01:02:28.695
Yeah, and nobody knows us
in Torque Town.

01:02:28.697 --> 01:02:30.995
Maybe we try lost and found.
Oh, wait a minute!

01:02:30.997 --> 01:02:35.063
I got an idea.
Let's call the police.

01:02:35.065 --> 01:02:37.495
Putt Putt, we just ran
from the police.

01:02:37.497 --> 01:02:40.095
You crazy?
We on the wanted list.

01:02:40.097 --> 01:02:42.862
We gotta keep on the down low.
We goin' underground.

01:02:42.864 --> 01:02:45.062
We need... disguises.

01:02:45.064 --> 01:02:47.965
Yes, disguises!

01:03:09.631 --> 01:03:12.030
Ha ha!
She's a friend of yours?

01:03:12.032 --> 01:03:14.030
Sure, she is.

01:03:14.032 --> 01:03:16.496
Next you'll be telling me
you're a racing car.

01:03:17.965 --> 01:03:19.629
This is pointless.

01:03:19.631 --> 01:03:21.830
How am I ever
going to find Bella?

01:03:21.832 --> 01:03:24.163
We just two of us.
Torque Town so big.

01:03:24.165 --> 01:03:26.930
It'll take a thousand Wheelys
to find Miss Bella.

01:03:26.932 --> 01:03:28.896
Hold on. That's it!

01:03:28.898 --> 01:03:30.797
You come up with
the best ideas

01:03:30.799 --> 01:03:34.130
when you're not thinking,
Putt Putt, which is always.

01:03:34.132 --> 01:03:36.996
I know just the place
to find a thousand Wheelys.

01:03:36.998 --> 01:03:38.663
Hi. I want the number

01:03:38.665 --> 01:03:41.664
of every taxi office
in Torque Town, please.

01:03:41.666 --> 01:03:43.631
Yes, you heard right.

01:03:50.631 --> 01:03:52.963
Ah, I knew this was
a prank call.

01:03:52.965 --> 01:03:55.096
The joker that got us here's
gonna pay for this.

01:03:55.098 --> 01:03:58.065
No, they won't.
You get it?

01:03:59.398 --> 01:04:02.164
Hi. Hello. Everybody?

01:04:06.432 --> 01:04:08.996
Hello!

01:04:08.998 --> 01:04:12.931
Are you the jerk that got us
out here on a wild goose chase?

01:04:12.933 --> 01:04:14.164
That's me.

01:04:14.166 --> 01:04:16.031
We should have him arrested.

01:04:16.033 --> 01:04:18.697
Now y'all, just chill.
Just chill.

01:04:18.699 --> 01:04:21.564
I called you all here
because you're just like me:

01:04:21.566 --> 01:04:25.764
ordinary guys, working taxis,
making a living.

01:04:25.766 --> 01:04:27.697
And I need your help.

01:04:27.699 --> 01:04:30.831
You'll need an ambulance
when we're finished with you!

01:04:30.833 --> 01:04:33.497
An ambulance?
I used to date an ambulance.

01:04:33.499 --> 01:04:35.630
It was a wreck from the start.
Whoa!

01:04:35.632 --> 01:04:36.997
No, please!

01:04:36.999 --> 01:04:39.031
I need help to find
my girlfriend.

01:04:39.033 --> 01:04:40.797
She's been car-napped.

01:04:40.799 --> 01:04:42.831
Bella di Monetti
is your girlfriend?

01:04:44.465 --> 01:04:46.397
He's crazy!

01:04:46.399 --> 01:04:49.430
A ride like her wouldn't be
seen dead with a ride like him.

01:04:52.933 --> 01:04:54.964
Why us?
Why not call the police?

01:04:54.966 --> 01:04:57.765
Well, that's a long story.

01:04:57.767 --> 01:04:59.898
A jailbird!
I should've known.

01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:02.664
I was framed. Please, guys.

01:05:02.666 --> 01:05:04.630
You're the eyes and ears
of the street.

01:05:04.632 --> 01:05:06.897
No one could pass through here
without y'all knowing.

01:05:06.899 --> 01:05:09.131
And why should we get mixed up
in some rich car business?

01:05:09.133 --> 01:05:11.765
What did they ever do for us,
huh, fellas?

01:05:11.767 --> 01:05:13.132
Telling me,
what have they ever done?

01:05:13.134 --> 01:05:15.664
- They never tip.
- That's for sure.

01:05:19.134 --> 01:05:20.997
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:05:20.999 --> 01:05:24.665
we are gathered here as the
kings and queens of the road.

01:05:24.667 --> 01:05:27.698
When have we ever judged anybody
by the gleam of their chrome

01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:29.132
or their engine size?

01:05:29.134 --> 01:05:30.898
Shame on all of you.

01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:33.665
All vehicles are born equal
in the eyes of the maker.

01:05:33.667 --> 01:05:37.798
No, no, wait! Please!
You're my last hope!

01:05:37.800 --> 01:05:39.498
In your sleep, Wheely!

01:05:49.967 --> 01:05:51.032
Wheely?

01:05:51.034 --> 01:05:52.698
Do I know you?

01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:55.532
The cinema, remember?

01:05:55.534 --> 01:05:57.565
Oh, yeah.

01:05:57.567 --> 01:06:01.665
You're the only one
who's ever recognized me.

01:06:01.667 --> 01:06:03.565
Look, if it's any help,

01:06:03.567 --> 01:06:06.465
I took a fare to the docks
yesterday, an out-of-towner.

01:06:06.467 --> 01:06:07.632
And?

01:06:07.634 --> 01:06:10.132
And I think I saw your friend

01:06:10.134 --> 01:06:13.099
being loaded onto
a rust-bucket ship called Crank.

01:06:13.101 --> 01:06:14.665
I wouldn't mess with those guys,
though.

01:06:14.667 --> 01:06:16.498
When they say
they wanna break you,

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:17.932
you'd better hope
they'll do it quick.

01:06:17.934 --> 01:06:19.133
Bella's in danger?

01:06:19.135 --> 01:06:20.766
I have to save her,
no matter what.

01:06:20.768 --> 01:06:22.766
- Can you bring me there?
- Yes, I can.

01:06:22.768 --> 01:06:25.431
I was about to head
in that direction anyway.

01:06:25.433 --> 01:06:27.099
Wait!
Putt Putt come along too.

01:06:27.101 --> 01:06:28.768
Putt Putt, stay put.

01:06:29.835 --> 01:06:31.732
But really, Wheely?

01:06:31.734 --> 01:06:34.966
Listen, Putt Putt, it's gonna be
a dangerous mission,

01:06:34.968 --> 01:06:37.033
and I need to ride this one out
without you.

01:06:37.035 --> 01:06:39.465
You've been the best buddy
any car could have,

01:06:39.467 --> 01:06:41.467
and I don't wanna lose you.

01:07:01.701 --> 01:07:04.599
Okay, here I go.

01:07:04.601 --> 01:07:06.966
Thanks for
helping me out here, Amy.

01:07:06.968 --> 01:07:08.966
Are you sure
you're up for this?

01:07:08.968 --> 01:07:11.633
Remember, once you're inside,

01:07:11.635 --> 01:07:14.532
follow the yellow line
to find Harbor Nine.

01:07:14.534 --> 01:07:15.634
I'll remember.

01:07:23.936 --> 01:07:25.633
Hey, hit reverse, mijo.

01:07:25.635 --> 01:07:27.632
This is private property.

01:07:27.634 --> 01:07:29.400
Yeah, beat it!

01:07:29.402 --> 01:07:32.500
Sorry. I had a call to drop off
a delivery to Harbor Nine.

01:07:32.502 --> 01:07:34.001
This is Harbor Nine?

01:07:36.402 --> 01:07:37.967
What delivery?

01:07:37.969 --> 01:07:39.567
How would I know?

01:07:39.569 --> 01:07:41.700
I just make the delivery.
It sounded urgent.

01:07:41.702 --> 01:07:44.867
Okay, you wait there.
I'll go check.

01:07:50.502 --> 01:07:51.834
What's the problem?

01:07:51.836 --> 01:07:53.134
Main gate here.

01:07:53.136 --> 01:07:55.034
Some taxi
with Gasket City plates

01:07:55.036 --> 01:07:56.934
with a delivery
for Harbor Nine.

01:07:56.936 --> 01:07:59.000
What taxi? What delivery?
What harbor?

01:07:59.002 --> 01:08:02.767
Taxi? Gasket City? Wheely!

01:08:02.769 --> 01:08:06.100
Tell him to shove off.
He's got it wrong.

01:08:06.102 --> 01:08:08.536
Typical taxi. Hmmph!

01:08:15.769 --> 01:08:17.633
Hey, can you
keep the noise down?

01:08:17.635 --> 01:08:19.634
Some of us are trying
to get our beauty sleep.

01:08:19.636 --> 01:08:21.403
Unbelievable.

01:08:22.435 --> 01:08:24.033
No delivery wanted here.

01:08:24.036 --> 01:08:27.801
Okay, then.
Well, I guess I should be off.

01:08:27.803 --> 01:08:28.868
See ya.

01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:31.569
- Yeah.
- Hey, stop him!

01:08:33.069 --> 01:08:35.100
Calling all taxis
in the harbor district.

01:08:35.102 --> 01:08:37.770
We have a colleague
in need of our assistance!

01:08:44.937 --> 01:08:46.368
Ready?

01:08:50.435 --> 01:08:51.837
Whoa!

01:08:54.069 --> 01:08:55.868
Whew!

01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:58.502
I've heard of going for a spin,
but that was ridiculous.

01:09:03.071 --> 01:09:04.169
Whew!

01:09:04.171 --> 01:09:06.370
I think I finally lost them.

01:09:08.136 --> 01:09:10.868
Okay, you need
to stop moving.

01:09:10.870 --> 01:09:12.868
We're tired
of playing catch, ese.

01:09:12.871 --> 01:09:16.401
You ain't going to be picking up
any more fares, carnal.

01:09:16.403 --> 01:09:18.035
So you coming with us?

01:09:18.037 --> 01:09:20.537
Or... you coming with us?

01:09:21.636 --> 01:09:23.135
Hold it, buddy!

01:09:23.136 --> 01:09:26.501
Ain't nobody taking
my brother taxi anywhere.

01:09:26.502 --> 01:09:29.401
Says who?

01:09:29.403 --> 01:09:31.571
Taxi!

01:09:34.937 --> 01:09:36.167
You called, Amy?

01:09:36.170 --> 01:09:37.769
What took you so long?

01:09:37.770 --> 01:09:39.569
If you creeps want
my friend over there,

01:09:39.571 --> 01:09:41.902
you'll have to
go through us first.

01:09:41.904 --> 01:09:44.468
You hear that, Rumble?

01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:46.901
She wants us
to go through her.

01:09:48.804 --> 01:09:50.337
With pleasure!

01:09:58.704 --> 01:10:00.936
Wheely, go find your lady love.

01:10:00.938 --> 01:10:02.936
We can't hold
these tin cans up forever.

01:10:02.938 --> 01:10:05.338
I'm on it.
Thank you, Amy!

01:10:08.971 --> 01:10:10.535
That's it!

01:10:10.537 --> 01:10:13.604
Follow the yellow line
to find Harbor Nine.

01:10:18.604 --> 01:10:20.538
What the...

01:10:22.838 --> 01:10:24.937
It must be here.

01:10:24.939 --> 01:10:27.939
Well, I guess there's only
one way to find out.

01:10:50.772 --> 01:10:53.170
Oh, Mr. Frank.

01:10:53.172 --> 01:10:58.137
Hey, aren't you the little bike
with the broken racecar?

01:10:58.139 --> 01:11:00.037
One year ago.

01:11:00.039 --> 01:11:02.536
What are you doing
back here again?

01:11:02.538 --> 01:11:03.837
How's your friend doing?

01:11:03.839 --> 01:11:05.503
Putt Putt got no friend.

01:11:05.505 --> 01:11:06.736
#nofriend.

01:11:06.738 --> 01:11:07.770
#lonely.

01:11:07.772 --> 01:11:10.170
#foreveralone.

01:11:10.172 --> 01:11:11.970
Oh, sorry.

01:11:11.972 --> 01:11:13.803
I thought you were
that little bike

01:11:13.805 --> 01:11:16.138
with the friend
who broke his axle.

01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:17.770
I found a replacement part,

01:11:17.772 --> 01:11:19.903
and I was gonna get him
to come by.

01:11:19.905 --> 01:11:21.637
Mr. Wheely got no time.

01:11:21.639 --> 01:11:22.770
He on dangerous mission.

01:11:22.772 --> 01:11:24.137
His girlfriend got car-napped,

01:11:24.139 --> 01:11:26.469
and now Mr. Wheely
gone to save her.

01:11:26.471 --> 01:11:28.171
Car-napped?

01:11:28.173 --> 01:11:31.570
Well, there's only one truck
who does that in Torque Town,

01:11:31.572 --> 01:11:33.803
and let me tell you,

01:11:33.805 --> 01:11:36.170
he is one mean trucker.

01:11:36.172 --> 01:11:38.938
I think your friend
needs help.

01:11:38.940 --> 01:11:41.706
But Mr. Wheely tell Putt Putt
to stay put.

01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:47.138
Hmm. "A friend in need
is a friend indeed."

01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:50.072
Maybe Wheely
needs Putt Putt help.

01:11:51.439 --> 01:11:53.771
Uh, Putt Putt don't know way.

01:11:53.773 --> 01:11:56.339
Mr. Frank show way?

01:12:05.739 --> 01:12:08.038
Hmm. It appears we have
a visitor.

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:09.171
A crazed taxi.

01:12:09.173 --> 01:12:11.071
Not exactly a worry,

01:12:11.073 --> 01:12:14.038
but a good chance to check out
the new security system.

01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:16.537
- Computer!
- Ready to assist.

01:12:16.539 --> 01:12:19.405
Let's mix up the pieces
a little, shall we?

01:12:19.407 --> 01:12:21.373
Randomizing.

01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:24.339
Huh?

01:12:53.607 --> 01:12:56.504
Why do I feel like someone's
playing me like a video game?

01:12:56.506 --> 01:12:58.572
Wahoo!

01:12:58.574 --> 01:13:00.574
Well, that was fun!

01:13:01.874 --> 01:13:05.740
This is a really bad idea.

01:13:07.774 --> 01:13:10.172
No such thing as bad idea,
Mr. Frank.

01:13:10.174 --> 01:13:13.672
Is how you do the idea
that makes it good or bad.

01:13:13.674 --> 01:13:15.872
Okay, kid, whatever you say.

01:13:15.874 --> 01:13:19.105
Now you go that way,
and I'll go this way.

01:13:19.107 --> 01:13:21.439
Mr. Frank not going
to help Putt Putt?

01:13:21.441 --> 01:13:23.139
Nope.

01:13:23.141 --> 01:13:24.907
Huh?

01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:28.073
Now, what you doing here?

01:13:28.075 --> 01:13:30.772
Enough intruders already.

01:13:30.774 --> 01:13:32.772
We should get a pay raise.

01:13:32.774 --> 01:13:36.675
I agree, carnal.
Now get inside.

01:13:37.708 --> 01:13:39.007
Not you, menso!

01:13:56.540 --> 01:13:58.674
Where are they taking us?

01:14:09.942 --> 01:14:12.140
Miss Bella, is that you?

01:14:12.142 --> 01:14:15.840
Sorry. If it's an autograph
you want, you're out of luck.

01:14:15.842 --> 01:14:19.073
No, no. I'm Putt Putt,
friend of Mr. Wheely.

01:14:19.075 --> 01:14:21.006
I'm sure he tell you
all about me.

01:14:21.008 --> 01:14:22.940
No.

01:14:22.942 --> 01:14:24.906
Is Wheely here?
I knew it!

01:14:24.908 --> 01:14:26.774
He was the taxi
who showed up earlier.

01:14:26.776 --> 01:14:28.406
But where is he now?

01:14:28.408 --> 01:14:32.008
I not know, but I do know
he our only hope.

01:14:41.043 --> 01:14:43.708
No, no!

01:14:48.142 --> 01:14:50.607
You need to do better
than that

01:14:50.609 --> 01:14:52.707
if you're gonna stop
Wheely O'Wheels.

01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:54.640
But you don't have to.

01:14:54.642 --> 01:14:56.807
Good, but not good enough.

01:14:56.809 --> 01:14:59.507
Computer,
give me manual override.

01:14:59.509 --> 01:15:02.509
Affirmative.
Manual override initiated.

01:15:13.043 --> 01:15:14.540
We have to get out of here

01:15:14.542 --> 01:15:16.174
before I get chopped up
like the rest.

01:15:16.176 --> 01:15:17.674
No chop chop.

01:15:17.676 --> 01:15:19.440
Mr. Frank, can you open door?

01:15:19.442 --> 01:15:21.375
I can try.

01:15:50.443 --> 01:15:51.476
Oh, no.

01:15:53.442 --> 01:15:56.676
This is... impossible!

01:16:06.977 --> 01:16:09.008
Face it.
You and me,

01:16:09.010 --> 01:16:10.875
we're not even
in the same league.

01:16:10.877 --> 01:16:12.807
Don't even dream that Bella
would ever want

01:16:12.809 --> 01:16:14.974
anything to do
with the likes of you.

01:16:14.976 --> 01:16:19.575
You're a loser, and you always
will be one, taxi boy.

01:16:23.010 --> 01:16:25.643
Oh, yeah?
We'll see about that.

01:16:30.710 --> 01:16:32.844
If you can't beat 'em,
join 'em!

01:16:36.611 --> 01:16:38.709
Come on, Wheely,
you have the speed,

01:16:38.711 --> 01:16:41.575
you've got the strength,
and also a junky axle,

01:16:41.577 --> 01:16:42.844
but you have the will.

01:16:56.111 --> 01:16:59.176
Well, that was
a smashing success.

01:16:59.178 --> 01:17:00.675
It's working! It's...

01:17:00.677 --> 01:17:01.775
Whoa. Whoa!

01:17:01.777 --> 01:17:03.010
Stay on track, Wheely.

01:17:05.144 --> 01:17:07.978
Yeah! I can do it.
I'm the man.

01:17:19.611 --> 01:17:21.511
A little bit more.

01:17:26.878 --> 01:17:29.978
Don't try this at home, kids!

01:17:33.578 --> 01:17:35.876
Aw, yeah! Who da man?

01:17:35.878 --> 01:17:38.109
Uh-uh!
I'm the man, all right?

01:17:38.111 --> 01:17:41.578
Thank you, thank you!
Did anyone see that?

01:17:45.112 --> 01:17:46.444
Come and get me.

01:17:56.112 --> 01:17:58.809
Now's about the time when
the hero's gotta drive away

01:17:58.811 --> 01:18:00.609
real slow, with a cool face,

01:18:00.611 --> 01:18:04.877
while everything comes crumbling
down behind him in slow-mo.

01:18:04.879 --> 01:18:06.377
Ha ha! Yeah!

01:18:08.411 --> 01:18:10.812
No explosions? Really?

01:18:14.878 --> 01:18:16.710
Later, Torque Town.

01:18:16.712 --> 01:18:18.645
You ain't going nowhere
with Bella.

01:18:21.712 --> 01:18:24.110
Whoa, whoa! What the...

01:18:25.512 --> 01:18:27.443
You might have been
tricky to find,

01:18:27.445 --> 01:18:30.077
but justice always wins
in the end. Clamp him!

01:18:30.079 --> 01:18:33.077
No, wait!
You're making a big mistake.

01:18:33.079 --> 01:18:35.810
I'm not the one you should
be cuffing. It's them!

01:18:35.812 --> 01:18:38.110
That gang of law-breaking,
violent car-nappers.

01:18:38.112 --> 01:18:39.610
They're the bad guys.

01:18:39.612 --> 01:18:41.878
You have a very vivid imag...

01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:44.710
What? Car-nappers?

01:18:44.712 --> 01:18:47.577
Stop in the name of the law!

01:18:47.579 --> 01:18:49.544
It's the cops.

01:18:49.546 --> 01:18:51.546
Crank it up,
on the double!

01:18:52.912 --> 01:18:55.945
Okay, Boss.
Ja makin' me smoke it up.

01:18:55.947 --> 01:18:58.078
Thanks to the police,
that idiot taxi

01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:01.346
won't ever
catch up with us now!

01:19:09.013 --> 01:19:11.111
We're starting to move.

01:19:11.113 --> 01:19:13.877
From motions in stomach,
it would seem so.

01:19:16.713 --> 01:19:17.811
Sea sickness.

01:19:19.179 --> 01:19:21.580
- Apologies in advance.
- Follow me.

01:19:24.579 --> 01:19:26.178
Focus on the ramp,
not the water.

01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:28.411
Water? Where?

01:19:28.413 --> 01:19:32.078
One, two, three, jump!

01:19:38.147 --> 01:19:40.411
We made it! We're alive!

01:19:40.413 --> 01:19:42.413
But where is Miss Bella?

01:19:44.013 --> 01:19:45.744
She didn't make it.

01:19:45.746 --> 01:19:46.778
Aah!

01:19:52.013 --> 01:19:53.812
Bella!

01:19:53.814 --> 01:19:55.678
Bella.

01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:59.544
Mr. Wheely, so sorry.
We did our best.

01:19:59.546 --> 01:20:00.578
So you've seen her?

01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:02.911
Yes. She still on board.

01:20:02.913 --> 01:20:04.878
Please, Sergeant Street,
let me go.

01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:06.781
I'm begging you.
I need to save her.

01:20:07.981 --> 01:20:09.779
I can't lose her now.

01:20:09.781 --> 01:20:11.477
Bella!

01:20:11.479 --> 01:20:12.646
Wheely!

01:20:15.148 --> 01:20:17.078
- Officer?
- Ma'am?

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:18.812
- Swing.
- Swing?

01:20:18.814 --> 01:20:20.512
- Swing?
- Swing?

01:20:20.514 --> 01:20:22.612
Swing! That's an order!

01:20:22.614 --> 01:20:23.714
Yes, ma'am.

01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:28.878
Faster, faster!

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:30.745
What are you doing, Officer?

01:20:30.747 --> 01:20:32.747
- You make him dizzy.
- It's "Sergeant!"

01:20:35.081 --> 01:20:37.112
Wheely!

01:20:37.114 --> 01:20:39.048
Now... release!

01:20:43.581 --> 01:20:45.048
Go get her, son.

01:20:46.781 --> 01:20:49.114
Whoa!

01:20:50.914 --> 01:20:52.179
Water?

01:20:52.181 --> 01:20:56.347
Anything, but not the water!

01:20:57.447 --> 01:21:00.180
Hey, did somebody order a taxi?

01:21:00.182 --> 01:21:01.479
What?

01:21:02.848 --> 01:21:03.846
Wheely!

01:21:03.848 --> 01:21:06.079
Crank, full speed ahead.

01:21:06.081 --> 01:21:07.412
Now!

01:21:07.414 --> 01:21:08.815
You got that, man.

01:21:10.882 --> 01:21:14.612
Uh, not gonna make it.

01:21:14.614 --> 01:21:17.948
Bella, hold on, I'm coming!

01:21:20.548 --> 01:21:22.113
Hah! See now?

01:21:22.115 --> 01:21:24.982
Why didn't anyone tell me
how fun flying was?

01:21:37.581 --> 01:21:40.479
Wow. That was
quite an entrance.

01:21:40.481 --> 01:21:43.115
Racers, we like
to put on a show.

01:21:55.983 --> 01:21:57.050
Bella, look out!

01:22:17.849 --> 01:22:19.914
Wheely!

01:22:19.916 --> 01:22:21.948
Hold on! I'm coming!

01:22:21.950 --> 01:22:24.615
This ship is First Class only.

01:22:30.882 --> 01:22:32.147
Wheely!

01:22:32.149 --> 01:22:33.850
No!

01:22:37.016 --> 01:22:39.916
You'll pay for this,
you crook!

01:22:47.482 --> 01:22:50.516
This really is too easy
to be any fun.

01:22:53.150 --> 01:22:55.614
We'll both go down together.

01:24:14.483 --> 01:24:18.982
So this is the famous Kaiser,
king of the car-nappers

01:24:18.984 --> 01:24:22.182
and the crowning glory
of my career.

01:24:22.184 --> 01:24:24.018
Okay, boys, clamp him.

01:24:26.152 --> 01:24:28.050
Slap my face.

01:24:28.052 --> 01:24:31.115
- Ow! Why you do that?
- You just said...

01:24:31.117 --> 01:24:33.449
It's a catchphrase.
It's Putt Putt catchphrase.

01:24:33.451 --> 01:24:36.150
Everyone knows
it's my catchphrase.

01:24:36.152 --> 01:24:38.816
But what about
Wheely and Bella?

01:24:38.818 --> 01:24:42.050
They went for a swim
to the bottom of the ocean!

01:24:43.685 --> 01:24:45.551
Take him away.

01:24:49.450 --> 01:24:53.551
Don't worry. We'll dredge
the sea bed until we find them.

01:24:58.118 --> 01:25:00.484
Look! Ship still afloat!

01:25:22.685 --> 01:25:25.951
You promise to tell the cops
I'm the one who helped save you.

01:25:25.953 --> 01:25:27.816
Remember, it was Crank
who stopped you

01:25:27.818 --> 01:25:29.883
from falling into water.

01:25:29.885 --> 01:25:32.018
And sorry I couldn't
save your bumper.

01:25:33.819 --> 01:25:35.516
Sorry about your pal.

01:25:35.518 --> 01:25:38.051
Wheely, can you hear me?

01:25:38.053 --> 01:25:39.951
Wake up, Wheely.

01:25:39.953 --> 01:25:42.883
I shouldn't have gotten you
into this mess.

01:25:42.885 --> 01:25:44.483
It's all my fault.

01:25:44.485 --> 01:25:46.617
Please, just wake up.

01:25:46.619 --> 01:25:49.086
I don't want to lose you,
you big klutz.

01:25:52.019 --> 01:25:54.783
I... love you too.

01:25:54.785 --> 01:25:56.819
What? Wheely!

01:25:58.052 --> 01:25:59.717
Ouch!

01:25:59.719 --> 01:26:01.184
- Bella...
- What?

01:26:01.186 --> 01:26:03.984
I thought you were dead.
Are we dead? Am I in heaven?

01:26:03.986 --> 01:26:05.650
But wait.
Why is there fire?

01:26:05.652 --> 01:26:08.719
Wheely. I was about
to fall over, but Crank...

01:26:21.119 --> 01:26:22.818
Well, here we are
at the first race

01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:24.483
of this new
street race season,

01:26:24.485 --> 01:26:26.417
which sees the return
of Wheely O'Wheels

01:26:26.419 --> 01:26:27.884
in his fresh new looks.

01:26:27.886 --> 01:26:29.851
Look at that gleaming
yellow and black

01:26:29.853 --> 01:26:31.117
with a little bit of white.

01:26:31.119 --> 01:26:33.084
He's a taxi.

01:26:33.086 --> 01:26:35.117
Yes, I-I know.

01:26:35.119 --> 01:26:38.650
And he'll be battling again
with his old foe, Jay Lo.

01:26:38.652 --> 01:26:40.550
That's Joe Flo.

01:26:40.552 --> 01:26:43.750
Sorry for my co-commentator's
slip of the tongue.

01:26:43.752 --> 01:26:45.585
Yeah, well, no one's perfect.

01:26:45.587 --> 01:26:48.184
You should know.
Back to the race now.

01:26:48.186 --> 01:26:50.852
And Jay Lo...
I mean Joe Flo...

01:26:50.854 --> 01:26:52.483
has hit the front.

01:26:52.485 --> 01:26:54.952
- No!
- I'm afraid so.

01:26:54.954 --> 01:26:57.984
But Wheely O'Wheels
still has a chance in this,

01:26:57.986 --> 01:27:00.518
the final stage of the race.

01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:04.118
Now that I've fixed his axle,
he'd better win this race.

01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:06.650
Your son make good,
Mrs. Momma.

01:27:06.652 --> 01:27:08.985
My son's always good,
whether he wins or not.

01:27:08.987 --> 01:27:10.785
I second that.

01:27:10.787 --> 01:27:13.152
It was so good of you to come
just for this race, Bella.

01:27:13.154 --> 01:27:15.185
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

01:27:15.187 --> 01:27:18.751
Besides, I have some time off
before my next movie.

01:27:18.753 --> 01:27:20.652
What you doing, boy?

01:27:20.654 --> 01:27:22.551
Pop those pistons
like you mean it!

01:27:22.553 --> 01:27:24.551
Did that momma just...

01:27:24.553 --> 01:27:26.418
I think she did.

01:27:26.420 --> 01:27:28.854
- She said...
- I heard what she said.

01:27:30.421 --> 01:27:33.152
So you say you know Wheely,
Madam Officer?

01:27:33.154 --> 01:27:36.019
It's "Captain!"

01:27:36.021 --> 01:27:39.518
That racer taxi foiled a global
car-napping ring, my boy.

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:41.186
We should all be grateful.

01:27:41.188 --> 01:27:45.118
I want you to become like
Wheely O'Wheels. Immediately!

01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:46.588
Ugh.

01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:51.551
Good to have you back
on the track, Wheely.

01:27:51.553 --> 01:27:53.618
I see you're now racing
in your taxi colors.

01:27:53.620 --> 01:27:55.053
Well, as my momma says,

01:27:55.055 --> 01:27:56.885
"It ain't about
what's on the outside.

01:27:56.887 --> 01:27:59.085
It's the inside that counts."

01:27:59.087 --> 01:28:02.786
You mean you like
my new leather interior?

01:28:02.788 --> 01:28:05.719
Hey, like I said:
All cars are created equal.

01:28:05.721 --> 01:28:08.751
I just prefer
black and white checks.
