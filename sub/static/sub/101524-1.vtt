02:47.618 --> 02:49.319
<i>...been keeping
a very close eye</i>

02:49.352 --> 02:51.521
<i>on the typhoon
over the last few days.</i>

02:51.556 --> 02:55.425
<i>It always was forecast to be a
very powerful, violent typhoon,</i>

02:55.459 --> 02:57.527
<i>and that's turned out
to be exactly the case,</i>

02:57.562 --> 02:59.529
<i>and you can see it clearly
here on the satellite.</i>

02:59.564 --> 03:01.032
<i>See of course the eye
very well defined,</i>

03:01.065 --> 03:02.667
<i>and around the eye,</i>

03:02.700 --> 03:04.869
<i>well, we've got
some very ferocious wind</i>

03:04.902 --> 03:07.304
<i>that's been causing
incredible damage.</i>

03:07.337 --> 03:11.274
<i>Gusts have been up to around
about 320 kilometers an hour,</i>

03:11.308 --> 03:13.410
<i>and it may landfall
pretty much at its peak,</i>

03:13.443 --> 03:14.946
<i>and those gusts of winds,</i>

03:14.979 --> 03:16.814
<i>well, throwing
the large objects around,</i>

03:16.848 --> 03:18.381
<i>causing, uh,
structural damage,</i>

03:18.415 --> 03:19.851
<i>widespread destruction.</i>

03:19.884 --> 03:21.753
<i>And it's not finished yet.</i>

03:21.786 --> 03:24.555
<i>The typhoon
right now is quite far away,</i>

03:24.589 --> 03:26.691
<i>with winds in the eye wall
that could exceed</i>

03:26.724 --> 03:29.359
<i>over 200 kilometers per hour.</i>

03:29.392 --> 03:32.063
<i>The typhoon is due
to make landfall in 12 hours.</i>

03:33.396 --> 03:34.966
<i>That's 7 p.m. local time.</i>

03:34.999 --> 03:36.801
<i>You need to evacuate</i>

03:36.834 --> 03:39.003
<i>if you're in the path
of the typhoon immediately.</i>

04:11.903 --> 04:12.937
Neil.

04:18.576 --> 04:19.677
Neil.

04:19.710 --> 04:21.712
Neil, are you okay?

04:21.746 --> 04:22.914
Neil.

04:22.947 --> 04:24.048
Honey.

04:25.116 --> 04:26.083
Neil.

04:26.117 --> 04:28.518
Oh, my God.

04:28.553 --> 04:30.453
Look at this room.

04:31.889 --> 04:33.490
Oh, my God.
Neil, we're late!

04:38.729 --> 04:40.598
Neil, seriously,
get up!

04:40.631 --> 04:42.399
<i>...large and violent typhoon</i>

04:42.432 --> 04:44.635
<i>makes its way
across the South China Sea.</i>

04:46.403 --> 04:48.573
<i>...make landfall
in Vietnam on Sunday.</i>

04:48.606 --> 04:50.975
<i>That really is the one to
watch over the next few days.</i>

04:51.008 --> 04:54.477
<i>Thank you, Michael.
The typhoon right now is quite far away.</i>

04:54.511 --> 04:56.948
<i>However, if you live
in this zone over here,</i>

04:56.981 --> 04:58.983
<i>you should be careful.</i>

04:59.016 --> 05:00.952
Oh, that doesn't look good.

05:03.788 --> 05:05.656
<i>...could potentially
make a direct hit.</i>

05:05.690 --> 05:07.424
<i>The typhoon is due to make
landfall in 12 hours...</i>

05:07.457 --> 05:08.491
Is that blood?

05:11.863 --> 05:13.598
What happened last night?

05:13.631 --> 05:15.933
<i>If you're in the path
of the typhoon,</i>

05:15.967 --> 05:18.769
<i>you need to evacuate,
get yourself somewhere safe.</i>

05:28.613 --> 05:30.581
Do you think we'll
still make the boat?

05:30.615 --> 05:32.116
Yeah, we'll make it.

05:38.623 --> 05:39.857
Did you buy me this?

05:41.125 --> 05:42.994
I have no idea.

05:43.027 --> 05:45.596
Doesn't really look like
either of our tastes.

05:45.630 --> 05:47.131
You know,
I can't even remember

05:47.164 --> 05:49.934
how we got back to the room
last night. Can you?

05:51.702 --> 05:55.472
No. The important thing
is we did, so good for us.

05:59.710 --> 06:01.612
Oh, wait, wait.
Wait, wait.

06:01.646 --> 06:03.480
This isn't right.

06:03.513 --> 06:05.816
He has to turn towards the
water to get to the ferry.

06:05.850 --> 06:07.952
Sir. Uh...

06:07.985 --> 06:09.620
<i>pai taing qua...</i>

06:09.654 --> 06:11.555
to ferry.

06:18.029 --> 06:19.597
What did he say?

06:19.630 --> 06:21.999
Something about a festival.

06:22.033 --> 06:24.235
Do you know
of any festival?

06:24.268 --> 06:26.737
San Khabuga, but it's not
for another two weeks.

06:26.771 --> 06:29.506
Oh, well, then he's padding
the fare by going the long way.

06:29.539 --> 06:30.675
Hey, yeah, yeah.

06:30.708 --> 06:31.609
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

06:36.847 --> 06:38.916
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

06:38.950 --> 06:40.184
<i>Rae...</i>

06:41.152 --> 06:43.520
<i>rae ka pe sei saam rap.</i>

06:43.554 --> 06:44.989
Okay? Yeah?

06:45.022 --> 06:47.024
We pay you extra
for direct.

06:50.027 --> 06:52.196
Could you slow down,
please? I-I can't...

06:53.965 --> 06:56.200
Hey, buddy, lis...
<i>Mi mae cha sakaal.</i>

06:56.233 --> 06:58.669
Okay, no... no festival.

06:58.703 --> 06:59.770
Okay? No festival.

06:59.804 --> 07:01.772
Yes, ferry.
No festival.

07:01.806 --> 07:03.708
- Ferry.
- Wait.

07:03.741 --> 07:04.775
What is he doing?

07:06.644 --> 07:08.212
You, get out!

07:08.245 --> 07:10.881
No, no, no.
Sir, sir, we're sorry.

07:10.915 --> 07:12.817
We have to get
to the ferry, okay?

07:12.850 --> 07:14.952
If you want more money,
we'll pay you.

07:14.986 --> 07:15.987
No, no, no, no, no.

07:16.020 --> 07:18.089
<i>Lakaa thos chanmi nuei.</i>

07:18.122 --> 07:19.090
Yeah?

07:20.324 --> 07:21.592
You get out!

07:22.994 --> 07:24.028
Get out!

07:48.319 --> 07:51.055
My passport and
my wallet are in here.

07:51.088 --> 07:53.190
- You sure?
- Your passport, too.

07:55.359 --> 07:58.329
And where is
my fucking phone?!

07:58.362 --> 08:00.998
- What...
- Hey, madame,

08:01.032 --> 08:02.833
no I.D., no board.

08:02.867 --> 08:04.635
No, no, no.
Come on.

08:04.668 --> 08:05.770
Sorry.

08:05.803 --> 08:07.038
Next, please!

08:12.043 --> 08:13.944
Okay, let's just
retrace our steps.

08:13.978 --> 08:16.313
When was the last time
you had your passport?

08:16.347 --> 08:18.082
Well, I paid for dinner,
remember,

08:18.115 --> 08:20.818
and then I put it away.

08:20.851 --> 08:22.920
I never
touched it again.

08:22.953 --> 08:24.889
Oh, no. Did I
leave it in the room?

08:24.922 --> 08:26.323
It's okay.
Don't worry about it.

08:26.357 --> 08:28.025
- I'm so stupid.
- We'll figure it out.

08:28.059 --> 08:29.660
It's okay.

08:29.693 --> 08:31.228
W-We'll figure
something out.

08:33.097 --> 08:36.801
I'm sorry, but we are already
late getting under way.

08:36.834 --> 08:40.237
If you find your I.D.,
there is another boat at 7:00.

08:40.271 --> 08:41.839
Well, what about the storm?

08:43.140 --> 08:44.275
That's land.

08:44.308 --> 08:46.377
No, I saw it on TV.

08:46.410 --> 08:49.814
There's a hurricane
or a typhoon coming.

08:49.847 --> 08:51.749
No, no, no. In 200 year,

08:51.782 --> 08:54.051
we never had a typhoon
or hurricane.

08:54.085 --> 08:56.087
200 year.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.255
Yeah. I know.
I read the brochure.

08:59.924 --> 09:02.059
Enjoy one more day,
okay?

09:04.061 --> 09:05.196
Thanks.

09:19.110 --> 09:20.311
Sweet.

09:21.278 --> 09:22.880
Wait. Where's the luggage?

09:22.913 --> 09:23.981
Wait!

09:24.014 --> 09:25.382
Wait, wait, wait!
Our luggage!

09:25.416 --> 09:27.918
Wait! Wait a minute!

09:27.952 --> 09:29.386
Hey! Can you stop them?!

09:29.420 --> 09:32.089
Um, c-can you call
the boat back, please?

09:32.123 --> 09:34.959
They have our luggage.
They took our luggage.

09:34.992 --> 09:36.927
No phone on the boat.

09:37.928 --> 09:39.096
Are you kidding me?

09:39.130 --> 09:40.664
Don't worry.

09:40.698 --> 09:43.667
It will be waiting
for you on the other side.

10:12.329 --> 10:14.431
Passports are gone.

10:14.465 --> 10:15.933
So's your phone.

10:21.438 --> 10:23.807
Why don't we take
a walk on the beach?

10:25.409 --> 10:27.211
Relaxed dress code.

10:27.244 --> 10:28.846
Optional, even.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.081
It would have to be,

10:31.115 --> 10:33.017
because they took
most of our luggage.

10:34.385 --> 10:37.321
Neil, we have to find
our passports.

10:37.354 --> 10:39.223
We have to take
the 7 p.m. ferry.

10:39.256 --> 10:41.225
We can cancel
the credit cards.

10:41.258 --> 10:42.760
Once we get back
to the mainland,

10:42.793 --> 10:44.061
we can go
to the embassy.

10:44.094 --> 10:45.863
I mean, they must handle
this sort of thing

10:45.896 --> 10:46.964
all the time, right?

10:49.133 --> 10:50.501
Okay.

10:50.534 --> 10:52.903
Hey, honey, relax.

12:23.861 --> 12:25.296
Hey.

12:25.329 --> 12:26.964
What's all this?

12:26.997 --> 12:28.432
I started thinking.

12:28.465 --> 12:31.068
I must have taken some photos
last night. All right.

12:31.101 --> 12:33.003
Okay.

12:33.037 --> 12:35.139
Let's see if we can
figure out what happened.

12:36.173 --> 12:37.408
This could get ugly.

12:37.441 --> 12:38.809
Oh, great.

12:39.910 --> 12:41.912
Here's dinner
at Hang-sen's.

12:41.945 --> 12:43.414
Looking sober.

12:43.447 --> 12:45.382
Drinks at Ping-Pong's.

12:45.416 --> 12:47.918
Dancing at this place,
looking very sexy.

12:47.951 --> 12:50.054
See, I remember all of this.

12:53.490 --> 12:55.259
Whoa.

12:55.292 --> 12:57.061
I was way drunk.

12:57.094 --> 12:58.529
You're deleting
all of this.

13:00.197 --> 13:01.198
Shit, there's a video,

13:01.231 --> 13:02.466
2 1/2 hours long.

13:06.904 --> 13:08.339
<i>All right,
this is Neil Oliver</i>

13:08.372 --> 13:10.174
<i>taking you
off the beaten path.</i>

13:10.207 --> 13:14.612
<i>We are in a bar, uh,
off the coast of Thailand.</i>

13:18.515 --> 13:19.917
<i>Drinks.</i>

13:19.950 --> 13:21.151
<i>Did you get
a good look, Neil?</i>

13:21.185 --> 13:22.219
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

13:24.121 --> 13:26.023
- <i>Over here!</i>
- <i>What are you doing?</i>

13:26.056 --> 13:28.392
- <i>We got an 18-hour flight.</i>
- <i>...is intense.</i>

13:28.425 --> 13:31.061
- <i>Are you sure?</i>
- <i>Oh, absolutely.</i>

13:31.095 --> 13:32.963
<i>Shh!</i>

13:32.996 --> 13:36.133
<i>The hot waitress is
trying to offer us a drink.</i>

13:36.166 --> 13:38.102
- <i>Oh!</i>
- <i>It's Madee.</i>

13:38.135 --> 13:41.939
<i>Hi, Madee!</i>

13:41.972 --> 13:44.375
<i>But it's still
an 18-hour flight.</i>

13:44.408 --> 13:47.244
<i>Then stay.</i>

13:47.277 --> 13:48.680
<i>Why leave paradise?</i>

13:48.713 --> 13:51.315
<i>Yeah. I mean,
why leave paradise?</i>

13:52.983 --> 13:56.120
<i>Uh, can you tell me
what exactly that is</i>

13:56.153 --> 13:57.988
<i>that you're
putting in there?</i>

13:59.223 --> 14:00.190
<i>Oh.</i>

14:00.224 --> 14:01.693
<i>Oh. Oh, good.</i>

14:05.663 --> 14:07.297
This is like an
out-of-body experience.

14:07.331 --> 14:08.666
I don't remember
any of this.

14:08.700 --> 14:10.300
<i>And one
for you, too.</i>

14:10.334 --> 14:11.669
- <i>No. I'm okay. I'm okay.</i>
- <i>Come on, baby.</i>

14:11.703 --> 14:13.270
- <i>Come on, baby.</i>
- <i>No, no.</i>

14:13.303 --> 14:15.239
<i>Okay. Well...</i>

14:17.541 --> 14:18.942
<i>This is SangSom,
right?</i>

14:18.976 --> 14:20.477
<i>No, seiysla.</i>

14:20.511 --> 14:22.379
<i>Call it island magic.</i>

14:30.622 --> 14:32.356
<i>Oh, it's so smooth.
Thank you.</i>

14:34.158 --> 14:36.360
<i>Oh, what's this?</i>

14:40.497 --> 14:42.099
- <i>Aww.</i>
- <i>Ah.</i>

14:42.132 --> 14:43.500
<i>So sweet.</i>

14:45.068 --> 14:47.004
<i>A gift.</i>

14:47.037 --> 14:50.708
<i>For your brave deeds,
may you endure.</i>

14:50.742 --> 14:52.644
<i>It will bring you
good health.</i>

14:52.677 --> 14:54.111
<i>Brave... Brave deeds?</i>

14:54.144 --> 14:56.413
<i>Brave enough
to do what, exactly?</i>

14:56.447 --> 14:58.449
<i>Leave it on you always.</i>

14:58.482 --> 15:00.083
<i>For good luck.</i>

15:00.117 --> 15:01.418
- <i>Wow, that's...</i>
- Guess we figured out

15:01.452 --> 15:03.253
where you got
the necklace.

15:03.287 --> 15:06.423
- <i>I've never seen...</i>
- <i>You've never... Excuse me.</i>

15:06.457 --> 15:08.192
<i>You stumped the expert.</i>

15:08.225 --> 15:10.360
<i>My husband is
a travel reporter.</i>

15:10.394 --> 15:12.529
<i>He's doing
a-a piece on the island.</i>

15:12.564 --> 15:15.199
- <i>It's why we're here.</i>
- <i>I-I'll do a piece on you.</i>

15:25.509 --> 15:26.711
<i>Sweetheart,
you all right?</i>

15:26.744 --> 15:28.312
<i>No. No.</i>

15:28.345 --> 15:30.214
<i>Are you joking?</i>

15:30.247 --> 15:31.348
<i>You need help?</i>

15:31.381 --> 15:33.718
<i>Sweetheart?</i>

15:33.751 --> 15:35.319
Hey!

15:35.352 --> 15:37.054
<i>Hey, what did you give us?</i>

15:38.121 --> 15:39.156
<i>Hey!</i>

15:40.324 --> 15:42.125
<i>Yeah, come on. I got you.</i>

15:42.159 --> 15:43.193
<i>Whoa.</i>

16:04.448 --> 16:05.415
<i>Neil?</i>

16:05.449 --> 16:07.585
Where are we?

16:07.619 --> 16:09.419
I have no idea.

16:20.665 --> 16:21.699
<i>Neil.</i>

16:31.208 --> 16:32.644
What the fuck?

17:10.314 --> 17:12.215
What are you doing?

17:54.324 --> 17:55.827
Neil...

17:55.860 --> 17:57.327
what the fuck?!

17:57.361 --> 17:58.663
What the fuck?

17:58.696 --> 17:59.764
...the fuck.

18:02.366 --> 18:04.702
Christine,
would you wait?

18:04.736 --> 18:06.203
Christine, wait!

18:07.872 --> 18:09.907
Christine,
please open the door.

18:12.944 --> 18:14.879
Open the door!

18:17.214 --> 18:19.751
Christine,
listen to me.

18:19.784 --> 18:21.318
We're okay.

18:21.351 --> 18:22.820
We were drugged.
That's all.

18:25.288 --> 18:26.724
Christine, I would
never hurt you.

18:27.992 --> 18:29.661
Now, will you
open this?

18:29.694 --> 18:30.928
Oh, my God.

18:30.962 --> 18:32.496
Oh, my...

18:32.529 --> 18:33.665
Oh, my God.

18:33.698 --> 18:35.566
Open up the door.

18:43.875 --> 18:45.743
Christine.

18:45.777 --> 18:47.511
Christine, baby,
open the door.

18:50.414 --> 18:51.949
Christine,
I need to know you're all right.

18:55.318 --> 18:56.353
Christine!

18:57.320 --> 18:58.355
Christine!

18:59.757 --> 19:01.726
Christine,
unlock the door.

19:15.973 --> 19:18.241
Christine!

19:18.275 --> 19:19.677
Neil!

19:19.711 --> 19:21.311
Christine!

19:21.344 --> 19:22.680
Baby!

19:23.881 --> 19:25.348
Neil.

19:25.382 --> 19:27.317
Hey!

19:27.350 --> 19:29.854
Oh, Jesus,
you're ice-cold.

19:32.023 --> 19:33.858
Honey...

19:33.891 --> 19:35.425
I want to go home.

19:35.459 --> 19:37.895
Take me home.

19:37.929 --> 19:40.832
It's all right.
It's all right.

19:40.865 --> 19:42.033
Let's get you
out of here.

19:42.066 --> 19:44.234
Come on. Let's get
you out of here.

19:46.369 --> 19:48.271
What the hell is this?!

19:48.305 --> 19:50.273
Look at the door,
Mommy!

19:50.307 --> 19:51.709
Nathida,
you stay there, okay.

19:51.743 --> 19:53.410
We booked this place
on Airbnb.

19:53.443 --> 19:54.746
You're the Olivers.

19:54.779 --> 19:57.014
You were supposed to be
checked out by now.

19:57.048 --> 19:58.950
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, she's fine.

19:58.983 --> 20:00.885
She's just...
She's feeling a little sick

20:00.918 --> 20:02.954
and locked herself
in the... the bathroom.

20:02.987 --> 20:04.689
- We missed our boat.
- Okay.

20:04.722 --> 20:06.490
I'd like
to hear her say that.

20:07.692 --> 20:09.426
I'm okay.

20:36.419 --> 20:37.588
It's from Samantha.

20:41.659 --> 20:43.995
I called a cab.
He's 15 minutes away.

20:52.937 --> 20:55.505
Samantha,
the room is a mess.

20:55.539 --> 20:57.975
It's "Mom," sweetie.

20:58.009 --> 20:59.744
She likes to show off.

20:59.777 --> 21:02.412
Where did you get this?

21:02.445 --> 21:05.016
What did Mommy say about
touching other people's things?

21:05.049 --> 21:07.919
Only to do it when
they're not looking.

21:07.952 --> 21:10.420
Oh, you're so smart.
Off you go.

21:28.005 --> 21:30.041
She needs
to see a doctor

21:30.074 --> 21:32.475
Yeah, I can...
I can take care of her.

21:32.509 --> 21:35.545
I think it's best we get out of
your hair and go find a hotel.

21:35.580 --> 21:37.648
Oh, you are not
gonna find a hotel.

21:37.682 --> 21:39.016
It's our busy season.

21:39.050 --> 21:40.651
We have room. It's fine.

21:40.685 --> 21:41.953
Listen,

21:41.986 --> 21:43.554
I know the doctor
on the island.

21:43.588 --> 21:45.556
I can get you in
today if you want.

21:59.604 --> 22:01.504
Hey.

22:05.943 --> 22:08.646
Uh, any English?

22:08.679 --> 22:09.647
A little.

22:09.680 --> 22:11.148
You are no Thai?

22:11.182 --> 22:13.818
No, I'm American.

22:13.851 --> 22:15.720
You American.

22:39.911 --> 22:42.146
Ahhhh.

22:44.916 --> 22:46.918
Ahhhh.

22:49.553 --> 22:51.454
Ahh.

22:53.858 --> 22:55.860
- Good.
- Okay.

22:55.893 --> 22:59.230
Doc, listen. We were
dosed with something,

22:59.263 --> 23:00.798
given a strange drink.

23:00.831 --> 23:02.667
She was very sick
this morning.

23:02.700 --> 23:04.135
She was... She was
vomiting dirt.

23:04.168 --> 23:06.037
Dirt.

23:13.644 --> 23:16.479
I think <i>Nam Mun Prai.</i>

23:16.513 --> 23:17.480
<i>Nam Mun Prai.</i>
What's...

23:17.514 --> 23:18.883
What <i>Nam Mun...</i>

23:18.916 --> 23:20.151
<i>Nam Mun Prai.</i>

23:20.184 --> 23:21.218
Okay.

23:21.252 --> 23:23.020
N-A-M...

23:23.054 --> 23:24.722
M-U-N...

23:24.755 --> 23:26.590
P-R-A-I.

23:29.126 --> 23:31.494
Okay. It's, uh...

23:31.528 --> 23:33.030
It's a hard-core
Buddhist drink,

23:33.998 --> 23:35.132
It's very poisonous,

23:35.166 --> 23:36.667
and it's
a powerful hallucinogen.

23:36.701 --> 23:39.904
You, hallucination.

23:39.937 --> 23:41.205
Paranoia, vomiting...

23:41.238 --> 23:43.007
basically everything
except death.

23:43.040 --> 23:45.009
Nope, death as well
if you drink too much.

23:45.042 --> 23:46.744
You think
this was a hallucination?

23:46.777 --> 23:48.212
Show him the video.

24:08.933 --> 24:10.801
Hollywood.

24:10.835 --> 24:12.903
No. No, he...

24:12.937 --> 24:14.605
- thinks it's a film.
- No.

24:18.342 --> 24:20.177
This is a real video,
okay?

24:20.211 --> 24:21.779
It's real.
It's not Hollywood.

24:21.812 --> 24:23.781
Real video.

24:23.814 --> 24:24.782
Yeah, real video.

24:24.815 --> 24:25.783
These bruises
are real.

24:25.816 --> 24:27.284
I choked her, okay?

24:27.318 --> 24:28.919
I can't remember it.

24:28.953 --> 24:31.022
I can't remember
the last 12 hours.

24:43.734 --> 24:44.802
Take.

24:44.835 --> 24:45.970
I'm not going
to drink this.

24:46.003 --> 24:47.171
Everything will be okay.

24:47.204 --> 24:48.973
- I'm not drinking this.
- No.

25:01.118 --> 25:04.989
Bad medicine
on our island.

25:11.195 --> 25:12.797
Very good food.

25:21.272 --> 25:23.140
Turn it off.

25:23.174 --> 25:24.775
Turn it off!

25:24.809 --> 25:26.243
I-I don't even understand
what I'm seeing.

25:26.277 --> 25:28.679
Yeah? Well, it looks
a lot like you to me.

25:28.712 --> 25:30.948
You know that's
not me, right?

25:30.981 --> 25:33.084
I was throwing up
dirt, Neil.

25:33.117 --> 25:34.285
Well, you were
covered in it.

25:34.318 --> 25:35.786
You must have
swallowed some of it...

25:35.820 --> 25:37.655
And what about
these bruises on my neck?

25:37.688 --> 25:38.756
They're from you.

25:38.789 --> 25:39.990
From me?

25:40.024 --> 25:41.692
What's on this video
is impossible.

25:41.725 --> 25:43.794
We watched you
snap my neck!

25:43.828 --> 25:46.197
Do you understand
how insane that sounds?

25:46.230 --> 25:49.233
You're standing here right in front of
me, and you're fine.

25:50.935 --> 25:52.770
Look,
what's on this video,

25:52.803 --> 25:56.974
there must be a less crazy
explanation for what we're seeing.

25:57.007 --> 25:57.975
Right?

26:02.413 --> 26:03.914
Neil?

26:04.949 --> 26:06.050
Neil?!

26:11.422 --> 26:13.324
Neil?!

26:13.357 --> 26:14.391
Oh, my God.

26:17.895 --> 26:20.364
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:20.397 --> 26:22.900
Cafe is like
a two-minute walk from here

26:22.933 --> 26:24.869
Wait.
Wh-Where did you go?

26:24.902 --> 26:26.837
Where were you
just now?

26:26.871 --> 26:28.172
What are you talking about?
I just...

26:28.205 --> 26:29.240
Christine, are you okay?
Come here.

26:29.273 --> 26:30.341
- Don't.
- What?

26:33.010 --> 26:34.044
Look...

26:35.146 --> 26:37.081
I understand
you're scared, okay?

26:37.114 --> 26:40.084
I-I'm scared, too,
but don't be scared of me.

26:40.117 --> 26:42.052
I would never
intentionally hurt you.

26:44.155 --> 26:45.389
If you want some space,

26:45.422 --> 26:47.124
I can go and try
and find the passports.

26:47.158 --> 26:49.727
Are you seriously suggesting
that we split up right now?

26:49.760 --> 26:51.328
- No, I'm just saying...
- You know what?

26:51.362 --> 26:52.796
Just go take
your pictures, Neil,

26:52.830 --> 26:54.165
'cause that's
what you wanna do.

26:54.198 --> 26:57.101
I'm just trying
to do the right thing.

26:57.134 --> 26:59.270
I... Only I don't know
what that is.

27:07.244 --> 27:08.846
I just wanna go home.

27:08.879 --> 27:10.347
Seven p.m. tonight,
we're getting on that ferry,

27:10.381 --> 27:12.116
and we're getting
the hell out of here.

27:17.788 --> 27:19.890
I'm sorry. I...

27:21.292 --> 27:23.127
I don't have
any other words.

27:23.160 --> 27:26.330
I don't know
what happened last night,

27:26.363 --> 27:27.765
but whatever it was...

27:29.466 --> 27:30.868
I'm sorry.

27:48.986 --> 27:50.821
Is this
the mystery festival?

27:57.027 --> 27:58.195
Yeah, I guess.

27:58.229 --> 28:00.130
You're welcome
to get closer.

28:01.999 --> 28:03.901
Miss,
I feel dumb for asking,

28:03.934 --> 28:07.071
but what festival
is this? Miss?

28:14.845 --> 28:16.313
Bon appétit!

28:19.850 --> 28:22.052
Did you see the way
she looked at this?

28:22.086 --> 28:23.320
Yeah.

28:24.321 --> 28:26.156
So creepy.

28:26.190 --> 28:27.324
I'm done.

28:37.401 --> 28:38.936
Go.

28:38.969 --> 28:40.104
It's why you came here.

28:41.138 --> 28:42.873
It's fine.

28:42.906 --> 28:44.041
You're the best.

30:49.533 --> 30:51.135
This is Neil Oliver.

30:51.168 --> 30:52.604
It's, uh, May 10,

30:52.637 --> 30:54.438
a day of no significance

30:54.471 --> 30:56.608
on the Thai
or Buddhist calendars,

30:56.641 --> 30:59.410
but as you can see, the...

30:59.443 --> 31:01.579
the islanders are celebrating.

31:01.613 --> 31:03.514
Something... Hey! Hey! Hey!

31:05.482 --> 31:07.117
God!

31:47.524 --> 31:48.726
Hey!

31:52.229 --> 31:53.497
What are you doing?

31:53.530 --> 31:54.632
God.

32:15.753 --> 32:18.088
- Where is my wife?
- The bathroom.

32:33.437 --> 32:35.506
Christine, honey, we need to leave.

32:35.539 --> 32:36.608
Chris...

32:45.215 --> 32:46.250
Christine!

32:58.596 --> 32:59.797
Christine!

33:10.240 --> 33:11.275
Christine!

33:22.152 --> 33:23.453
Christine!

33:50.147 --> 33:51.181
Christine!

33:52.850 --> 33:55.218
Hey. Have you seen her?

33:58.556 --> 34:00.324
Hey. Have you seen her?

34:00.357 --> 34:01.593
Mr. Oliver!

34:01.626 --> 34:03.193
We found your wife!

34:07.397 --> 34:08.365
Christine!

34:14.438 --> 34:15.472
Christine?

34:15.505 --> 34:16.641
Christine, sweetheart.

34:16.674 --> 34:17.842
Say something.

34:17.875 --> 34:19.644
- Her arm!
- I got you. Got you.

34:19.677 --> 34:21.278
Yeah, I can see
her fuckin' arm.

34:21.311 --> 34:22.546
Ah, it's okay.

34:25.515 --> 34:27.685
What the fuck
happened to her, huh?

34:30.822 --> 34:32.456
Sorry.

34:32.489 --> 34:33.758
Sorry.

34:33.791 --> 34:34.759
Hurts.

34:34.792 --> 34:36.426
Aw, what happened?

34:36.460 --> 34:38.261
Huh?
Come on, sweetie.

34:38.295 --> 34:41.198
I-I must have looked around the
entire town looking for you.

34:41.231 --> 34:43.668
Where'd you go, huh?

34:43.701 --> 34:45.369
God.

34:47.504 --> 34:48.873
Did you put this back on me?

34:48.906 --> 34:50.708
What? No.

34:50.742 --> 34:53.477
I left it on the table
at the cafe.

34:53.510 --> 34:55.747
Why won't you tell me
what happened?

34:55.780 --> 34:57.447
You won't believe me.

34:58.415 --> 34:59.717
What are you
talking about?

34:59.751 --> 35:01.819
After today, try me.

35:07.558 --> 35:09.861
Let's go get this
bandaged properly, okay?

35:16.601 --> 35:18.301
When I got my vision back,

35:18.335 --> 35:20.571
I looked up at them, and they
were completely faceless.

35:20.605 --> 35:22.674
Their eyes were sewn shut.

35:22.707 --> 35:23.941
Their mouths were sewn shut.

35:26.376 --> 35:27.912
I sound totally crazy.

35:27.945 --> 35:29.914
No. No, look...

35:29.947 --> 35:31.381
I believe you.

35:31.415 --> 35:32.449
Check this out.

35:33.417 --> 35:35.318
It looks just like you.

35:35.352 --> 35:36.788
- Kind of.
- Yeah.

35:45.262 --> 35:47.264
- Wait. She gave me the necklace.
- Christine...

35:47.297 --> 35:48.566
Hey!

35:49.567 --> 35:50.601
Hey!

36:29.040 --> 36:30.775
Excuse me.

36:30.808 --> 36:32.910
There was a woman
who just left here.

36:32.944 --> 36:35.479
Can you tell us
something about her?

36:40.651 --> 36:42.053
Chakrii...

36:45.690 --> 36:46.724
My son.

36:48.092 --> 36:49.493
Needs a doctor,
don't you think?

36:50.828 --> 36:52.797
No, just rest.

36:53.931 --> 36:55.666
What do you know
about this necklace?

36:57.467 --> 36:58.703
Anything?

37:07.544 --> 37:09.312
Hey, hey, easy.
Easy.

37:15.753 --> 37:16.788
Okay.

37:18.589 --> 37:19.757
Thank you.

37:27.732 --> 37:29.000
What the fuck was that?

37:29.033 --> 37:31.569
It's an honor on our island,

37:31.602 --> 37:34.538
special gift
for celebrated guest.

37:34.572 --> 37:35.539
A celebrated guest?

37:35.573 --> 37:37.809
I'm a tourist,
all right?

37:37.842 --> 37:38.910
Do you know Madee?

37:38.943 --> 37:41.078
The woman
who just left here,

37:41.112 --> 37:42.546
she gave this to me.

37:42.580 --> 37:44.481
You want to thank her?

37:44.514 --> 37:46.117
Yes. I want to thank her

37:46.150 --> 37:47.885
for the 12 hours
that have gone missing

37:47.919 --> 37:49.352
since she gave me
this necklace.

37:49.386 --> 37:50.755
Our passports
have been stolen.

37:50.788 --> 37:52.522
I was gone again
for another hour.

37:52.557 --> 37:53.791
My husband looked
for me everywhere.

37:53.825 --> 37:54.826
He couldn't find me.

37:54.859 --> 37:56.561
He didn't know
where I was!

37:56.594 --> 37:58.830
I've been seeing shit that I
don't even know is real!

37:58.863 --> 38:00.631
It's all right.

38:03.568 --> 38:08.072
Look, we just want
to know one thing, okay?

38:08.105 --> 38:09.874
Tell us
how to find Madee.

38:24.121 --> 38:25.388
Madee's bar.

38:26.489 --> 38:28.491
I don't recommend you go.

38:28.525 --> 38:30.561
It's not for westerners.

38:30.595 --> 38:32.663
Yeah, well,
it's too late,

38:32.697 --> 38:34.431
'cause I think
we've already been.

39:39.096 --> 39:42.600
Ms. Christina,
Mr. Neil.

39:42.633 --> 39:43.834
What surprise.

39:43.868 --> 39:45.002
You ran from us.

39:45.036 --> 39:46.904
Run from you?

39:48.139 --> 39:49.640
We all look alike,
right?

39:49.674 --> 39:51.508
Come. Come.

40:01.552 --> 40:03.154
Neil, that looks
like my dress.

40:09.727 --> 40:12.596
I try to find you.

40:12.630 --> 40:14.799
You went home fast,
and you forgot it.

40:14.832 --> 40:17.500
Oh, yeah, it must have
been really tough

40:17.534 --> 40:19.937
to find two foreigners
in a town this big, huh?

40:19.971 --> 40:24.008
Everybody
are foreigners here.

40:24.041 --> 40:25.876
I came from
somewhere else...

40:27.645 --> 40:28.846
as did many.

40:30.848 --> 40:33.084
Wait. Wh-Where's the other...

40:33.117 --> 40:35.518
Where's...
Where's my wife's passport?

40:35.553 --> 40:36.754
Only you.

40:36.787 --> 40:38.656
What? Listen.

40:38.689 --> 40:41.058
After we left here
last night,

40:41.092 --> 40:43.694
I choked my wife and then
buried her in a ditch.

40:50.134 --> 40:52.770
Kinky.

40:52.803 --> 40:54.905
That's what happen when
you ride the <i>manu miti.</i>

40:54.939 --> 40:56.674
The what?

40:56.707 --> 40:57.875
Dream bird.

40:57.908 --> 41:01.879
They say it...
it opens up your mind,

41:01.912 --> 41:03.714
free your soul.

41:03.748 --> 41:05.750
But I wouldn't touch it.

41:06.784 --> 41:08.518
Too many side effects.

41:10.154 --> 41:12.189
Like hallucination,

41:12.223 --> 41:14.959
scramble the brain.

41:14.992 --> 41:18.129
So you wouldn't take it,
but you serve it?

41:22.900 --> 41:25.002
My friend,
you're the one

41:25.036 --> 41:27.571
who asked
for the drink yourself,

41:27.605 --> 41:29.140
and I rewarded you...

41:29.173 --> 41:30.841
for your bravery.

41:30.875 --> 41:32.143
Take your bravery back.

41:32.176 --> 41:34.111
No.

41:34.145 --> 41:36.313
It's not yours
to give.

41:36.347 --> 41:38.182
What the hell
does that even mean?

41:38.215 --> 41:40.184
I am so sick
of this cryptic bullshit.

41:49.026 --> 41:50.661
What happened last night?

41:50.694 --> 41:53.164
And where is my passport?

41:55.332 --> 41:57.668
I think we should
get out of here.

42:05.276 --> 42:06.710
I'll see you around.

43:28.726 --> 43:32.096
Hey, one of Samantha's
neighbors is a fisherman.

43:32.129 --> 43:34.331
He's gonna take us
to the mainland now.

43:34.365 --> 43:35.833
What? Really?

43:37.301 --> 43:38.335
No!

43:39.970 --> 43:41.372
You can't go.

43:41.405 --> 43:43.174
Isn't
the ferry at 7:00?

43:43.207 --> 43:45.776
We found another boat that
will take us off the island.

43:45.809 --> 43:48.045
They have to go back
to their own home, sweetie.

43:49.346 --> 43:51.949
Why don't you help Neil
with the bags, okay?

43:51.982 --> 43:54.084
O-Okay. Uh...

43:54.118 --> 43:55.886
lead the way.

43:58.155 --> 43:59.924
He'll make a great father.

44:05.429 --> 44:07.131
Thank you
for everything.

44:07.164 --> 44:08.432
Oh...

44:08.465 --> 44:10.234
And the juice made me
feel so much better.

44:10.267 --> 44:11.936
Oh, yeah?
Island magic, right,

44:11.969 --> 44:14.038
just like your necklace.

44:15.339 --> 44:18.075
What is that?
Is that a real thing?

44:18.108 --> 44:20.211
Or is that
just superstition?

44:21.278 --> 44:22.846
I mean,
I used to think so.

44:22.880 --> 44:24.848
But I used to be
really sick.

44:24.882 --> 44:27.818
I went to a specialist
in America, Canada, China.

44:27.851 --> 44:31.021
Finally someone said
I should come to this island.

44:31.055 --> 44:32.289
I had no idea
what to expect.

44:32.323 --> 44:33.891
I mean, I thought
I was gonna meet

44:33.924 --> 44:35.526
a witch doctor or something,
not that I care.

44:35.560 --> 44:37.895
I mean, at that point,
everything was on the table.

44:37.928 --> 44:41.031
But, uh, I got here.

44:42.499 --> 44:44.468
I don't know.
It was the best thing for me.

44:44.501 --> 44:45.836
I haven't been sick since.

44:45.869 --> 44:48.205
So whether you
call that clean air,

44:48.239 --> 44:50.241
climate, or magic,
I'll take it.

44:50.274 --> 44:52.309
Well, listen.

44:52.343 --> 44:54.445
I-I'm not a believer.

44:54.478 --> 44:56.213
You clearly are, so...

44:56.247 --> 44:58.249
why don't you
just take this?

44:58.282 --> 45:00.184
I can't, no.

45:00.217 --> 45:02.820
It's, uh...
It's not meant for me.

45:02.853 --> 45:05.356
You should probably
just keep it for good luck.

45:08.459 --> 45:09.860
Right.

45:11.295 --> 45:13.364
Well, look, if you're
ever in Boston...

45:13.397 --> 45:16.800
Ah, I did 26 years
in Minnesota,

45:16.834 --> 45:18.502
so if you're lucky
enough to find paradise,

45:18.535 --> 45:20.170
why try to leave, right?

46:02.614 --> 46:05.149
Hey. I was
just thinking.

46:05.182 --> 46:06.551
No one knows
where we are.

46:06.584 --> 46:08.018
What are you talking about?

46:08.052 --> 46:09.621
Well, we were supposed
to be on a flight

46:09.654 --> 46:11.589
to the States
this afternoon.

46:11.623 --> 46:13.090
Let me borrow
your phone.

46:15.993 --> 46:17.194
Honey?

46:17.227 --> 46:18.262
Your phone.

46:19.263 --> 46:20.497
Who are you gonna call?

46:20.531 --> 46:21.999
My Dad. My sister.

46:22.032 --> 46:23.367
The FBI. I don't know.

46:23.400 --> 46:25.969
Who did the guy
in <i>The Wicker Man</i> call?

46:26.003 --> 46:28.439
No one. They
burned him to death.

46:28.472 --> 46:30.040
Oh, yeah.

46:30.074 --> 46:32.343
He didn't have
a cell phone, though.

46:32.376 --> 46:34.945
I'm gonna try
and get reception.

46:34.978 --> 46:36.080
I love you.

46:58.435 --> 46:59.937
Come on.

46:59.970 --> 47:01.138
Come on, come on, come on.

47:28.566 --> 47:29.601
<i>This is Neil Oliver</i>

47:29.634 --> 47:31.669
<i>taking you off the beaten path.</i>

47:31.703 --> 47:33.537
<i>For my travel companion
and I,</i>

47:33.571 --> 47:36.073
<i>there's no hope of us
ever leaving this island.</i>

47:36.106 --> 47:37.575
- What the fuck?
- <i>Christine,</i>

47:37.609 --> 47:39.644
<i>we're about to die
horrible deaths.</i>

48:08.439 --> 48:09.540
Neil?

48:42.674 --> 48:44.308
Neil!

49:07.699 --> 49:09.166
Neil!

49:59.684 --> 50:01.485
Where's my husband?

50:03.788 --> 50:05.757
No, where's my husband?

50:07.592 --> 50:08.626
My husband!

50:12.129 --> 50:13.163
There was a boat!

50:14.197 --> 50:16.099
Where did he go?!

50:17.735 --> 50:18.770
Neil!

50:20.270 --> 50:22.640
No, he...

50:29.914 --> 50:31.381
Where is he?

50:34.652 --> 50:36.486
I-I saw him.

50:36.520 --> 50:37.589
He...

50:38.590 --> 50:42.159
He cut...
He cut himself open,

50:42.192 --> 50:43.728
and then he...

50:43.761 --> 50:46.664
he fell off
the end of the dock

50:51.903 --> 50:53.638
See this blood?

50:53.671 --> 50:55.272
This is...
This is his blood.

50:55.305 --> 50:57.441
H-He's on the dock.

50:57.474 --> 50:59.744
Uh...

50:59.777 --> 51:01.411
- Fish. Fish.
- No.

51:01.445 --> 51:03.681
No! No!

51:03.715 --> 51:05.248
How did
nobody see this?

51:06.784 --> 51:07.919
The tide
is out then.

51:07.952 --> 51:09.152
There couldn't
have been a boat.

51:09.186 --> 51:10.354
There was a boat.

51:10.387 --> 51:11.623
Oh, God.

51:12.624 --> 51:14.659
Hey! You!

51:14.692 --> 51:16.594
You saw the boat
and the water!

51:16.628 --> 51:18.328
You saw me, right,

51:18.362 --> 51:20.297
and my husband
on the dock?

51:21.566 --> 51:23.333
Uh...

51:25.268 --> 51:28.205
Christine...

51:28.238 --> 51:29.272
...Neil.

51:30.975 --> 51:32.744
He... He said one.

51:32.777 --> 51:34.511
He said it was
just you, not Neil.

51:34.544 --> 51:35.647
He said only one.

51:35.680 --> 51:38.583
Wh-What is he trying to do?

51:39.617 --> 51:40.618
What is he trying to do?

51:40.652 --> 51:41.786
What is...

51:41.819 --> 51:43.721
- Just calm down, please.
- Oh, God.

51:45.288 --> 51:46.323
Witnesses
heard you screaming.

51:46.356 --> 51:47.424
Wait. Where's his phone?

51:47.457 --> 51:48.458
His... His phone?

51:50.293 --> 51:51.763
- You camera?
- No, his phone.

51:51.796 --> 51:52.764
On him.

51:52.797 --> 51:54.599
No, I had it.

51:54.632 --> 51:56.199
I had it.
Somebody took it.

51:57.534 --> 51:59.336
Uh, he said, "Did you
and Neil fight?"

51:59.369 --> 52:01.706
No! No!

52:01.739 --> 52:04.942
My husband and I
were fine!

52:04.976 --> 52:06.911
Oh, my God,
what are you doing?

52:06.944 --> 52:08.345
What is he doing?!

52:08.378 --> 52:09.914
What is this?

52:09.947 --> 52:12.817
No, why don't you
come on? Come on.

52:32.536 --> 52:36.641
Hey, you should
drink something.

54:28.953 --> 54:30.320
Neil!

54:32.890 --> 54:33.891
Neil.

54:36.828 --> 54:39.931
Neil! Neil.

54:58.481 --> 54:59.516
Christine!

55:00.483 --> 55:02.053
Christine, it's Neil...

55:02.086 --> 55:03.621
on the phone!

55:03.654 --> 55:06.389
Huh? Huh?

55:10.695 --> 55:12.730
Neil?

55:14.632 --> 55:15.600
Neil?

55:16.901 --> 55:18.636
Honey?

55:18.669 --> 55:20.037
Neil, speak up, honey.

55:20.071 --> 55:21.504
I can't hear you.

55:22.539 --> 55:24.976
Hello? Hello?

55:30.547 --> 55:32.149
I lost the signal.

55:32.183 --> 55:33.918
- What did he say?
- I just...

55:33.951 --> 55:35.553
The reception was bad.

55:35.586 --> 55:37.420
He just said,
"Neil," and...

55:37.454 --> 55:38.990
Did he say he was okay?

55:39.023 --> 55:41.659
I just ran
to give you the phone.

55:43.027 --> 55:44.729
Oh, this is bullshit.

55:44.762 --> 55:46.197
Somebody's messing with us.

55:46.230 --> 55:49.200
Do you want to call
the police?

55:49.233 --> 55:50.568
I know who's doing this.

55:53.604 --> 55:55.006
I know where he is.

56:14.792 --> 56:16.493
<i>A typhoon warning
is in effect...</i>

56:21.799 --> 56:24.201
<i>Typhoon Maicala,
a major typhoon</i>

56:24.235 --> 56:27.705
<i>is poised to make landfall
in five hours.</i>

56:27.738 --> 56:29.607
<i>Expect pounding rain,
flash flooding...</i>

56:29.640 --> 56:31.175
What are you and
Nathida going to do?

56:31.208 --> 56:33.177
<i>...240 kilometers per hour.</i>

56:33.210 --> 56:37.014
A storm hasn't hit
the island in 200 years.

56:38.716 --> 56:41.185
<i>...could sweep away
anything not nailed down.</i>

56:41.218 --> 56:43.187
<i>Just to put this
in context for you...</i>

56:45.289 --> 56:49.794
<i>...winds of
130 kilometers an hour.</i>

56:49.827 --> 56:52.563
<i>It is shaping up to be
the storm of the year,</i>

56:52.596 --> 56:53.898
<i>if not the decade,
and it's already</i>

56:53.931 --> 56:56.834
<i>been classified
as a super typhoon.</i>

57:06.543 --> 57:09.046
This is the part where I
tell you not to go in.

57:10.681 --> 57:12.717
This is part
where I don't listen.

57:17.288 --> 57:18.556
Neil!

57:24.128 --> 57:25.495
Neil!

57:29.300 --> 57:30.533
Honey?

58:12.143 --> 58:14.011
Where is my husband?

58:42.239 --> 58:44.241
Mommy.

58:44.275 --> 58:46.010
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, hey.

58:46.043 --> 58:48.779
Easy. Easy. Hey.

58:49.747 --> 58:51.015
How did I get here?

58:52.383 --> 58:54.151
You don't remember?

58:54.185 --> 58:55.352
Whoa!

59:05.930 --> 59:08.699
How did I
get back here?

59:08.732 --> 59:12.770
Uh, as soon as you left
the car, you passed out.

59:12.803 --> 59:14.705
You collapsed
right in front of us.

59:14.738 --> 59:16.307
No, that's not possible.

59:16.340 --> 59:17.942
You don't remember?

59:17.975 --> 59:19.977
I need a minute, please.

59:20.945 --> 59:22.913
Yeah, sure.

1:00:24.308 --> 1:00:25.342
Neil?

1:00:26.510 --> 1:00:28.045
Christine?

1:00:30.281 --> 1:00:31.882
What's happening?

1:00:31.916 --> 1:00:33.384
I don't...

1:00:33.417 --> 1:00:34.919
Where is it?

1:00:34.952 --> 1:00:36.287
What?

1:00:36.320 --> 1:00:37.688
This?

1:00:46.230 --> 1:00:48.265
I've heard
of those things

1:00:48.299 --> 1:00:52.069
healing the sick,
healing worse.

1:00:52.102 --> 1:00:54.238
You need to see
a doctor.

1:00:55.773 --> 1:00:57.107
If Neil were here...

1:00:57.141 --> 1:00:58.175
He's not.

1:00:59.410 --> 1:01:01.979
It was in your head,
what you saw.

1:01:02.012 --> 1:01:04.148
Neil didn't kill himself
at the end of my dock.

1:01:04.181 --> 1:01:05.282
Then what happened?

1:01:07.218 --> 1:01:08.485
He, uh...

1:01:09.954 --> 1:01:11.789
He showed me
the video.

1:01:14.491 --> 1:01:16.160
Why would he do that?

1:01:16.193 --> 1:01:17.895
I...

1:01:17.928 --> 1:01:20.464
He was freaking out when I
found you in the bathroom.

1:01:20.497 --> 1:01:23.100
He said he didn't
know how or why,

1:01:23.133 --> 1:01:25.970
and he was scared
he would do it again.

1:01:26.003 --> 1:01:28.205
And you're
just telling me this now?!

1:01:28.239 --> 1:01:31.442
If I saw a video of me
putting hands on my daughter,

1:01:31.475 --> 1:01:34.378
I'd wanna get as far away
from her as possible.

1:01:35.580 --> 1:01:37.348
Look, I know
you don't trust me.

1:01:37.381 --> 1:01:39.783
You don't
even know me.

1:01:41.418 --> 1:01:42.920
But whatever is
going on with you,

1:01:42.953 --> 1:01:44.255
you need
to see a doctor.

1:01:44.288 --> 1:01:46.257
I'll do it when I
get back to the mainland.

1:01:46.290 --> 1:01:48.993
You need
a doctor from here.

1:01:50.294 --> 1:01:51.996
Christine.

1:02:08.345 --> 1:02:10.781
Hmm.

1:02:12.149 --> 1:02:13.117
You are pregnant.

1:02:19.089 --> 1:02:20.924
That's not possible.

1:02:20.958 --> 1:02:23.595
Our island is good
for fertility.

1:02:23.628 --> 1:02:26.297
Pregnant women
are sacred here.

1:02:27.531 --> 1:02:29.567
Neil will be
so happy.

1:02:29.601 --> 1:02:31.368
Congratulations.

1:02:31.402 --> 1:02:32.536
That's not happening.

1:02:32.570 --> 1:02:34.204
There's no way.

1:02:38.208 --> 1:02:40.144
Do you want to see?

1:02:55.225 --> 1:02:56.427
Oh, my God.

1:02:57.461 --> 1:02:58.996
That's amazing.

1:02:59.029 --> 1:03:01.599
Is that
the heartbeat?

1:03:01.633 --> 1:03:03.334
Yeah.

1:03:07.971 --> 1:03:12.443
Doctor,
this hallucination?

1:03:12.476 --> 1:03:13.645
<i>Nam Mun Prai?</i>

1:03:13.678 --> 1:03:16.413
No. No <i>Nam Mun Prai.</i>

1:03:22.252 --> 1:03:25.189
They said
it wasn't possible.

1:03:43.575 --> 1:03:46.210
What was that?

1:03:46.243 --> 1:03:48.145
He wants you to relax.
He's worried about you.

1:03:49.146 --> 1:03:50.147
Oh, no.
Don't you dare.

1:03:50.180 --> 1:03:52.082
Don't you dare!

1:03:53.685 --> 1:03:55.386
Wait! Christine,
wait! It's ok...

1:04:14.037 --> 1:04:15.506
What is this?

1:04:16.741 --> 1:04:19.076
What's happening?

1:04:19.109 --> 1:04:21.378
Storm.
You need to leave.

1:04:21.412 --> 1:04:23.347
I haven't found Neil yet.

1:04:23.380 --> 1:04:25.449
My... My husband.

1:04:27.151 --> 1:04:28.452
No husband.

1:04:28.485 --> 1:04:30.354
Ride?

1:04:30.387 --> 1:04:32.624
Boat?

1:04:32.657 --> 1:04:36.260
I... No, I don't want
a ride or... or a boat.

1:04:36.293 --> 1:04:38.730
I need to find my husband,
and then I'll get a ride.

1:04:41.498 --> 1:04:44.501
Can I borrow your...
your phone?

1:04:44.535 --> 1:04:45.969
Your cell phone?

1:04:49.406 --> 1:04:51.275
No service.

1:04:51.308 --> 1:04:52.309
Of course.

1:05:20.805 --> 1:05:22.339
Hello?

1:05:24.408 --> 1:05:25.743
Hello?

1:05:29.480 --> 1:05:30.648
Kanda?

1:05:48.833 --> 1:05:50.768
I'm pregnant.

1:05:52.804 --> 1:05:56.006
Stop.
You already know that.

1:05:59.476 --> 1:06:04.348
There was a time when everybody
didn't have a phone in their pocket.

1:06:06.350 --> 1:06:08.553
You were never meant
to see what happened.

1:06:10.688 --> 1:06:13.323
You would have
remained unaware.

1:06:13.357 --> 1:06:15.492
I am brutally aware
that my husband

1:06:15.526 --> 1:06:17.629
forced himself on me
and then strangled me.

1:06:17.662 --> 1:06:19.096
Forced?

1:06:19.129 --> 1:06:22.099
No, encouraged...

1:06:22.132 --> 1:06:24.234
to create a new life.

1:06:24.268 --> 1:06:26.136
Being pregnant,

1:06:26.169 --> 1:06:28.071
there is no stronger spirit
in our faith.

1:06:28.105 --> 1:06:30.642
No, no, stop.
I was dead, okay?

1:06:30.675 --> 1:06:33.176
I saw the video.
How am I standing here?

1:06:34.579 --> 1:06:38.115
Not quite dead.
Not quite living.

1:06:38.148 --> 1:06:41.518
That necklace keeps
the scales from tipping

1:06:41.553 --> 1:06:42.854
in the wrong direction.

1:06:42.887 --> 1:06:47.157
Right now, you exist
on the spiritual plane,

1:06:47.190 --> 1:06:49.861
where the spirits can prepare
you for the final ritual.

1:06:49.894 --> 1:06:51.161
I know this sounds...

1:06:51.194 --> 1:06:52.730
Fucking insane? Yeah.

1:06:57.267 --> 1:06:59.336
For hundreds of years,

1:06:59.369 --> 1:07:01.305
they have been
burying pregnant women

1:07:01.338 --> 1:07:03.708
under the post
of the town square.

1:07:03.741 --> 1:07:07.812
They believe that these sacrifices
get them what they want,

1:07:07.845 --> 1:07:09.513
to keep the island safe.

1:07:09.546 --> 1:07:12.817
and tonight,
they sacrifice you to stop the storm.

1:07:16.486 --> 1:07:18.690
Oh, fuck that.
I can't even believe

1:07:18.723 --> 1:07:20.324
this conversation
we're having right now.

1:07:20.357 --> 1:07:21.893
Are you kidding me?

1:07:21.926 --> 1:07:23.661
The man that I've loved
since I was 19,

1:07:23.695 --> 1:07:26.430
he conspired to kill me by
order of these crazy people.

1:07:27.932 --> 1:07:29.567
It wasn't him.

1:07:31.636 --> 1:07:32.737
<i>Nam Mun Prai...</i>

1:07:34.639 --> 1:07:36.540
corpse oil.

1:07:36.574 --> 1:07:39.376
It can control your mind.

1:07:39.409 --> 1:07:42.279
They gave it to Neil,
and he buried you in our soil.

1:07:47.752 --> 1:07:52.824
My son, he doesn't
have much time left,

1:07:52.857 --> 1:07:55.325
days, maybe weeks.

1:07:56.460 --> 1:07:59.296
I don't believe
in their rituals.

1:07:59.329 --> 1:08:02.867
I don't believe an unwilling
sacrifice can stop the storm,

1:08:02.900 --> 1:08:05.535
but I do
believe in that.

1:08:05.570 --> 1:08:08.606
It has
the power to heal.

1:08:08.640 --> 1:08:12.442
I can help you
if you help my son.

1:08:12.476 --> 1:08:14.177
Just give me
the necklace...

1:08:14.211 --> 1:08:18.181
No, not until you
help me find my husband

1:08:18.215 --> 1:08:20.852
and get us
off this fucking island.

1:08:20.885 --> 1:08:22.754
Then you can have
whatever you want.

1:09:01.626 --> 1:09:02.827
Ahh!

1:10:01.986 --> 1:10:03.320
No, no, no.

1:10:03.353 --> 1:10:06.023
You need a doctor.

1:10:10.494 --> 1:10:12.029
My... My son.

1:10:25.743 --> 1:10:27.612
Sorry.

1:10:30.047 --> 1:10:31.281
Okay.

1:10:52.003 --> 1:10:53.037
Kanda?

1:11:00.443 --> 1:11:01.846
Oh, no. Oh, no.

1:11:10.054 --> 1:11:11.622
Run!

1:11:11.656 --> 1:11:13.558
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

1:11:21.866 --> 1:11:22.900
Run.

1:11:35.947 --> 1:11:37.081
Hello?

1:11:37.114 --> 1:11:38.716
Is anybody...

1:11:38.749 --> 1:11:40.450
I need help.

1:11:40.483 --> 1:11:42.019
Shit.

1:11:42.053 --> 1:11:43.855
Excuse me.
Can you help me?

1:11:45.923 --> 1:11:47.959
Can you help me?

1:11:47.992 --> 1:11:49.392
Can you help?

1:11:51.996 --> 1:11:53.496
Excuse me.

1:11:53.530 --> 1:11:54.799
I need...

1:12:00.872 --> 1:12:01.973
Excuse me!

1:12:03.040 --> 1:12:05.142
I need a phone.
Can you help me?

1:12:05.176 --> 1:12:06.143
No, no, no.

1:12:06.177 --> 1:12:07.612
Christine, oh, my God.

1:12:07.645 --> 1:12:09.412
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

1:12:09.446 --> 1:12:11.414
She's dead.

1:12:11.448 --> 1:12:12.583
Who?

1:12:12.617 --> 1:12:14.517
- Kanda.
- God.

1:12:14.552 --> 1:12:16.519
Come on.
Let's get you out of here.

1:12:16.554 --> 1:12:17.922
Are you taking me
to the ferry?

1:12:17.955 --> 1:12:20.157
Yeah. Come on.

1:12:21.491 --> 1:12:22.927
Why are you
dressed like them?

1:12:22.960 --> 1:12:24.562
What, this?
This is for the festival.

1:12:24.595 --> 1:12:26.597
Come on. I just parked
over here. Let's go.

1:12:35.106 --> 1:12:37.808
<i>Right now, the typhoon
is only 1 1/2 hours away,</i>

1:12:37.842 --> 1:12:40.211
<i>so if you are still
within the path of the typhoon,</i>

1:12:40.244 --> 1:12:41.979
<i>then you need to evacuate</i>

1:12:42.013 --> 1:12:43.948
<i>or get yourself
to somewhere safe immediately.</i>

1:12:43.981 --> 1:12:46.684
<i>If your power goes out,
remain calm.</i>

1:12:46.717 --> 1:12:48.185
Mom, this isn't
the way to the ferry.

1:12:48.219 --> 1:12:49.687
It's a shortcut.

1:12:49.720 --> 1:12:51.956
This is
against the rules.

1:12:51.989 --> 1:12:53.024
Nathida.

1:12:54.025 --> 1:12:55.458
Sorry. She plays
these games.

1:12:55.492 --> 1:12:56.761
Sweetie, Mama needs
to concentrate, okay?

1:12:56.794 --> 1:12:59.230
She wants to go
to the ferry.

1:12:59.263 --> 1:13:01.498
You have
to take her.

1:13:04.001 --> 1:13:05.069
Stop the car.

1:13:05.102 --> 1:13:06.671
I'm taking you
to the ferry.

1:13:06.704 --> 1:13:08.706
Stop lying.

1:13:10.507 --> 1:13:11.575
Mommy...

1:13:11.609 --> 1:13:12.843
she knows.

1:13:17.514 --> 1:13:18.816
I'm not a bad person.

1:13:19.817 --> 1:13:21.552
What happened
to my husband?

1:13:25.957 --> 1:13:28.192
You saw Kanda's son.

1:13:28.225 --> 1:13:31.696
That's what happens when you only
believe when it's convenient.

1:13:31.729 --> 1:13:33.798
This, this is
the real deal.

1:13:33.831 --> 1:13:35.132
The real deal?

1:13:35.166 --> 1:13:36.834
Ritual sacrifice?

1:13:39.270 --> 1:13:42.606
Kanda used to believe,
and her son was fine.

1:13:42.640 --> 1:13:44.108
You're bat-shit fucking crazy.
You know that?

1:13:44.141 --> 1:13:46.677
- I love my daughter!
- Your daughter?

1:13:46.711 --> 1:13:48.980
Back there was the first time
you ever saw an ultrasound.

1:13:51.215 --> 1:13:52.717
She's not
very good at this.

1:13:52.750 --> 1:13:53.784
Shut up, Nathida!

1:13:56.988 --> 1:13:58.022
Where's your Mom?

1:13:59.924 --> 1:14:01.859
Stop lying.

1:14:03.027 --> 1:14:04.829
Where is your Mom?

1:14:06.330 --> 1:14:08.566
Down below.

1:14:13.070 --> 1:14:14.805
She loved this island.

1:14:16.007 --> 1:14:18.676
It was a sacrifice
she was happy to make.

1:14:18.709 --> 1:14:19.744
It's an honor.

1:14:20.711 --> 1:14:21.912
You killed her mother?

1:14:21.946 --> 1:14:23.546
I didn't do anything.

1:14:23.581 --> 1:14:25.082
She volunteered.

1:14:25.116 --> 1:14:28.219
She loved this island
and her little girl.

1:14:28.252 --> 1:14:29.920
I said I was sick
when I came here.

1:14:29.954 --> 1:14:32.156
Stage-three
pancreatic cancer.

1:14:32.189 --> 1:14:36.327
But here, there's
no such thing as cancer,

1:14:36.360 --> 1:14:40.164
heart attacks, stroke,
not for those who believe.

1:14:40.197 --> 1:14:42.166
That life
growing inside of you

1:14:42.199 --> 1:14:44.635
when it wasn't possible
everywhere else...

1:14:45.903 --> 1:14:49.240
Yeah.
A gift this island gave you.

1:14:49.273 --> 1:14:52.810
This is some bastardized
fanatical backwash

1:14:52.843 --> 1:14:55.946
that you soulless
motherfuckers came up with

1:14:55.980 --> 1:14:59.050
to... to feel like you
have some kind of control,

1:14:59.083 --> 1:15:01.018
that you have a say
in any of this!

1:15:01.052 --> 1:15:02.653
Where the fuck
is my husband?!

1:15:02.686 --> 1:15:05.322
Your husband is dead,
Christine.

1:15:05.356 --> 1:15:08.926
He killed himself
right in front of your eyes.

1:15:08.959 --> 1:15:10.661
That is this island,

1:15:10.694 --> 1:15:12.696
and its people
believe in something

1:15:12.730 --> 1:15:14.932
far greater than you
or your fucking...

1:16:35.112 --> 1:16:37.948
Ms. Christine.

1:20:03.253 --> 1:20:05.022
What are we doing here?

1:20:52.570 --> 1:20:55.072
Will you just let me go?

1:20:55.105 --> 1:20:58.475
For generation, it was a great honor, Ms.
Christine,

1:20:58.509 --> 1:21:00.411
to be marked as celebrated.

1:21:02.212 --> 1:21:03.414
And tonight
we celebrate you.

1:21:06.383 --> 1:21:10.020
We thank you
for your gift...

1:21:11.155 --> 1:21:12.523
for our island.

1:21:17.161 --> 1:21:20.097
And at all times,
people volunteer for this honor.

1:21:20.130 --> 1:21:21.733
You should be proud.

1:21:21.766 --> 1:21:23.333
Volunteer?

1:21:23.367 --> 1:21:26.003
I didn't volunteer
for this. Fuck you!

1:21:26.036 --> 1:21:28.172
The drink,
you asked for.

1:21:28.205 --> 1:21:30.642
The necklace,
you accept.

1:21:30.675 --> 1:21:33.343
No. We had some shots,

1:21:33.377 --> 1:21:36.180
and you put some stupid
trinket around my neck.

1:21:36.213 --> 1:21:37.514
You did that.

1:21:37.548 --> 1:21:41.151
You had free will,
Ms. Christine.

1:21:41.185 --> 1:21:45.690
You could have left, but you chose to
stay, find your husband.

1:21:47.625 --> 1:21:50.093
There were boats,
Ms. Christine.

1:21:51.663 --> 1:21:53.565
I believe
he offered you one.

1:22:01.205 --> 1:22:03.575
Because free will
is so essential.

1:22:03.608 --> 1:22:08.011
Of course, something,
free will is an illusion.

1:22:08.045 --> 1:22:09.379
You saw Neil died,

1:22:09.413 --> 1:22:11.515
but you chose
not to leave.

1:22:11.548 --> 1:22:13.551
No.

1:22:13.585 --> 1:22:17.589
Did you just not run
right to us right here

1:22:17.622 --> 1:22:20.190
at our old city pillar?

1:22:59.463 --> 1:23:01.098
Don't fucking touch me.

1:23:02.266 --> 1:23:04.034
I'm not pregnant,
you motherfucker!

1:23:05.770 --> 1:23:09.106
Pregnant,
you very much are.

1:23:09.139 --> 1:23:12.509
She is one part
from your husband

1:23:12.543 --> 1:23:16.280
and one part
from this island.

1:23:16.313 --> 1:23:18.282
No, what did you
put inside me?

1:23:22.720 --> 1:23:24.689
Island magic.

1:23:32.129 --> 1:23:33.598
I never had free will.

1:23:35.265 --> 1:23:37.200
If I have free will,
untie me.

1:23:40.337 --> 1:23:41.538
You don't have
to believe it...

1:23:41.573 --> 1:23:43.206
but we do.

1:23:44.308 --> 1:23:45.610
We will honor our gods.

1:24:21.345 --> 1:24:23.213
What are we doing here?

1:24:30.622 --> 1:24:32.189
It's a girl.

1:24:42.299 --> 1:24:44.301
You're going
to be a great Dad.

1:24:44.334 --> 1:24:46.436
She's gonna do
amazing things.

1:24:46.470 --> 1:24:48.472
Both of you are
gonna do amazing things.

1:24:49.907 --> 1:24:51.843
But I need you
to wake up.

1:24:54.544 --> 1:24:56.146
I wanna stay here.

1:25:00.652 --> 1:25:02.419
Wake up!

1:25:20.605 --> 1:25:23.808
Stop! It has
to be her choice!

1:25:23.841 --> 1:25:24.976
Stay back!

1:25:25.009 --> 1:25:27.210
Stay the fuck back.

1:25:27.244 --> 1:25:28.713
You, where's your boat?

1:25:28.746 --> 1:25:30.748
You!

1:25:30.782 --> 1:25:32.784
If you go, I'll die.

1:25:32.817 --> 1:25:35.586
They'll all die.

1:25:42.459 --> 1:25:44.494
It's not real, Nathida.
It's just a storm.

1:25:44.528 --> 1:25:45.830
- It is real!
- No!

1:25:45.863 --> 1:25:47.330
Come with me.

1:25:47.364 --> 1:25:48.733
Save us, Christine.

1:27:44.715 --> 1:27:46.751
<i>Reports are
coming in from Thailand</i>

1:27:46.784 --> 1:27:48.686
<i>that super typhoon Maicala</i>

1:27:48.719 --> 1:27:51.722
<i>has bypassed
the majority of the islands,</i>

1:27:51.756 --> 1:27:54.058
<i>with the exception
of the tiny island</i>

1:27:54.091 --> 1:27:55.660
<i>of Little Ko Kut.</i>

1:27:55.693 --> 1:27:57.128
<i>Ko Kut hasn't seen a storm</i>

1:27:57.161 --> 1:27:59.764
<i>of this magnitude
in over 200 years,</i>

1:27:59.797 --> 1:28:02.900
<i>so long, in fact, that they
advertise this to tourists.</i>

1:29:00.157 --> 1:29:01.859
<i>All right, copy that.</i>
