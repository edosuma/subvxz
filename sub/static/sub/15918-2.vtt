WEBVTT

00:02.347 --> 00:05.047
Niecey, are you pregnant again?

00:05.139 --> 00:07.806
Look, I love Niecey.
I want to be there for our baby.

00:07.837 --> 00:09.836
Your show hasn't worked out
as well as we'd hoped.

00:09.837 --> 00:10.836
We'd like to know

00:10.837 --> 00:12.836
if you'd consider consulting
on Mark's show.

00:12.837 --> 00:14.836
Mom, put this on,
come on, come on.

00:14.837 --> 00:16.836
I just wish she'd go on
and die.

00:16.837 --> 00:17.836
Did you know that me
and your husband

00:17.837 --> 00:18.836
have been sleeping together?

00:18.837 --> 00:19.836
Does he love you?

00:19.837 --> 00:21.836
He says he does.

00:21.837 --> 00:23.836
I was wondering if you might be
up for some consensual sex.

00:23.837 --> 00:26.836
Well, I don't know if stealing
semen is an epidemic,

00:26.837 --> 00:28.837
but it is certainly a sign
of our changing times.

You wanted to talk?

00:53.837 --> 00:55.836
Absolutely, come in.

00:55.837 --> 00:58.837
Hey.

01:03.837 --> 01:05.836
You know,
some of our best moments,

01:05.837 --> 01:07.836
were our weekend getaways,
right here.

01:07.837 --> 01:11.836
We'd sleep in and watch movies
and order room service and...

01:11.837 --> 01:16.836
I know, I know...
I know what we did, Dre.

01:16.837 --> 01:17.836
What do you want?

01:17.837 --> 01:20.836
'Cause every second
that I'm standing here

01:20.837 --> 01:23.837
just reminds me
of how desperate I am

01:24.837 --> 01:28.836
to be sleeping with
another woman's husband.

01:28.837 --> 01:30.836
So what do you want?

01:30.837 --> 01:34.837
For you to marry me.

01:35.837 --> 01:36.836
I love you.

01:36.837 --> 01:38.836
We just screwed in the gym...
that's not love!

01:38.837 --> 01:40.921
- Why isn't it?
- Why not?

01:41.837 --> 01:42.836
Because it's not!

01:42.837 --> 01:45.836
Look, I was gonna
tell you everything... I was!

01:45.837 --> 01:47.836
You know, when I...

01:47.837 --> 01:50.836
When I drove over
to your house and I was drunk.

01:50.837 --> 01:54.836
Look, Mary Jane,
I got juiced up

01:54.837 --> 01:57.837
so I could tell you...

02:02.837 --> 02:06.837
that this was in the car.

02:12.837 --> 02:18.836
And I swear
on my mother's grave...

02:18.837 --> 02:21.836
that I was gonna tell you
everything, Mary Jane.

02:21.837 --> 02:23.836
I just wanted to make sure,

02:23.837 --> 02:26.836
I needed to tell me
you'd be cool with...

02:26.837 --> 02:29.836
with, with, you know,
her and my kids...

02:29.837 --> 02:31.836
I can't do this.

02:31.837 --> 02:33.837
I can't.

02:37.837 --> 02:39.837
You're playing a game
with yourself.

02:44.837 --> 02:47.836
Look, I tried to pray you away.

02:47.837 --> 02:49.837
I tried.

02:50.005 --> 02:52.836
I mean, you know.

02:52.837 --> 02:54.836
But you're hard to pray away!

02:54.837 --> 02:58.339
Two words kept coming to me.
Suffering and surrender.

02:58.837 --> 03:00.836
We're not put on
this earth to suffer,

03:00.837 --> 03:01.837
so we need to surrender.

03:02.837 --> 03:05.836
So...

03:05.837 --> 03:10.837
If you have me,

03:11.837 --> 03:14.837
just say you have me.

03:16.837 --> 03:19.837
All you do is make me cry.

03:26.837 --> 03:28.836
I have to tell her something.

03:28.837 --> 03:30.836
I'm going home today and
I have to tell Avery something.

03:30.837 --> 03:33.837
I need to tell her something.

03:38.837 --> 03:42.837
â™ª <i>... Ne me quitte pas</i> â™ª

05:27.932 --> 05:30.931
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, Dad.

05:30.932 --> 05:32.932
I haven't seen Goldie
in a while.

05:33.932 --> 05:34.931
Yeah.

05:34.932 --> 05:35.931
How you doing?

05:35.932 --> 05:38.931
I'm all right.

05:38.932 --> 05:41.931
You wanna race?
Come on, that's a hybrid.

05:41.932 --> 05:43.931
Way to wiggle out
of getting beat.

05:43.932 --> 05:45.931
You and Mom going for a drive?

05:45.932 --> 05:48.931
Well, that was the plan.

05:48.932 --> 05:50.931
She'll come around.

05:50.932 --> 05:53.931
No, she won't.

05:53.932 --> 05:55.931
But hey, I'd hate to waste
a good car washing.

05:55.932 --> 05:57.931
We haven't had a daddy-daughter
date in a while.

05:57.932 --> 05:58.931
That's right, we haven't.

05:58.932 --> 06:00.931
All right, it's a date,
I'll set it up.

06:00.932 --> 06:01.931
No, no, I'll set it up.

06:01.932 --> 06:02.931
All right.

06:02.932 --> 06:04.931
Auntie!

06:04.932 --> 06:05.931
What are you doing here?

06:05.932 --> 06:08.931
Niecey, don't tell me you forgot
your appointment with Dr. Hudson,

06:08.932 --> 06:10.932
who charges if you're late,
so, let's go.

06:11.932 --> 06:12.931
You didn't get my text?

06:12.932 --> 06:13.931
I don't have time for this.

06:13.932 --> 06:15.931
Go put on one of your funny hats
and let's go.

06:15.932 --> 06:16.931
No, for real,

06:16.932 --> 06:19.931
I texted you that Dante wants to
take me, so I moved the appointment.

06:19.932 --> 06:20.931
That's just great, Niecey.

06:20.932 --> 06:24.931
I could have worked out
and saved the gas.

06:24.932 --> 06:25.931
Bye, Dad.

06:25.932 --> 06:27.932
Bye, baby.

06:34.932 --> 06:38.932
A simple apology for forgetting
to tell her works too, you know.

06:41.651 --> 06:42.931
<i>Today we are talking</i>

07:03.932 --> 07:05.931
How was your trip?

07:05.932 --> 07:07.932
It was fun.

07:08.932 --> 07:09.931
You closed the deal?

07:09.932 --> 07:11.931
I closed the deal.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.931
Well, good.

07:13.932 --> 07:17.931
'Cause we are now the proud
sponsors of the dunk booth

07:17.932 --> 07:19.931
at Hunter's school fair.

07:19.932 --> 07:22.931
I thought we just wrote that
school a check for $10,000.

07:22.932 --> 07:25.932
Yes, but that
was annual giving.

07:26.932 --> 07:27.931
Oh, and Monday,

07:27.932 --> 07:30.931
you need to go to Sophia's
kindergarten class to read.

07:30.932 --> 07:32.931
I would suggest
"Sugarplum Ballerinas."

07:32.932 --> 07:35.931
We picked the book out already.

07:35.932 --> 07:36.932
Oh.

07:38.932 --> 07:42.931
Um, Avery, I think we should
sit down and talk.

07:42.932 --> 07:45.931
Do you remember Jill?

07:45.932 --> 07:46.931
What?

07:46.932 --> 07:48.931
The tax attorney
from my old firm?

07:48.932 --> 07:51.931
Used to flirt
with you all the time.

07:51.932 --> 07:52.932
Oh, yeah.

07:53.932 --> 07:54.931
Jill.

07:54.932 --> 07:58.932
She found out her husband
was cheating on her.

08:00.932 --> 08:03.931
And here's the kicker.

08:03.932 --> 08:05.931
She's not leaving him.

08:05.932 --> 08:08.931
After getting drunk and
having sex with her trainer,

08:08.932 --> 08:11.931
she goes back to him.

08:11.932 --> 08:14.931
Tells him that she gets it,
she works a lot,

08:14.932 --> 08:18.931
she wants to salvage
their marriage.

08:18.932 --> 08:21.931
There's just one condition.

08:21.932 --> 08:25.931
She drew up a post-nup stating
that if he ever cheats again,

08:25.932 --> 08:27.676
she gets the house and the kids

08:27.732 --> 08:30.931
and he has to pay
a crazy amount in alimony.

08:30.932 --> 08:33.931
And he signed it!

08:33.932 --> 08:35.932
Wow.

08:40.932 --> 08:44.931
Here's your paperwork.

08:44.932 --> 08:48.931
It's just a lot of words to say
that I will get both houses,

08:48.932 --> 08:53.931
my alimony, 75% of your interest
in your marketing firm.

08:53.932 --> 08:55.931
Oh, and of course,

08:55.932 --> 08:57.932
full custody of the kids.

09:00.932 --> 09:04.932
Please sign and initial
on the marked pages.

09:08.932 --> 09:12.931
No matter what goes down
between me and you,

09:12.932 --> 09:13.931
there will never be a day

09:13.932 --> 09:17.932
when you can threaten
to take my kids.

09:26.932 --> 09:28.932
Oh, my God.

09:31.932 --> 09:34.932
You do love her.

09:48.271 --> 09:49.858
<i>It is not a crime.</i>

09:49.903 --> 09:51.603
<i>It is not illegal to be here</i>

09:51.666 --> 09:53.665
<i>without the proper</i>
<i>documentation.</i>

09:53.666 --> 09:56.665
<i>What is the real issue?</i>

09:56.666 --> 09:57.665
<i>Illegal is a label.</i>

09:57.666 --> 09:59.665
<i>We gotta get past labels.</i>

09:59.666 --> 10:01.665
<i>What are you, just a jaywalker?</i>

10:01.666 --> 10:03.665
<i>Just a draft dodger?</i>

10:03.666 --> 10:05.665
<i>A homewrecker?</i>

10:05.666 --> 10:07.665
<i>That's not what we are.</i>

10:07.666 --> 10:09.665
<i>We are multi-dimensional</i>
<i>human beings</i>

10:09.666 --> 10:12.666
<i>and we shouldn't</i>
<i>just be labeled by words</i>

10:13.666 --> 10:15.665
<i>that society has to stick on us</i>

10:15.666 --> 10:17.266
<i>for one reason or another...</i>

10:17.336 --> 10:18.336
He's not coming.

10:18.589 --> 10:20.589
Oh, he's coming.

10:23.687 --> 10:26.687
He wants to hear her heartbeat.

10:34.687 --> 10:36.855
He's not coming.

10:37.687 --> 10:39.687
Would you stop saying that?

10:42.687 --> 10:44.686
I told you and your sister

10:44.687 --> 10:46.687
these boys will say a lot
to get in your pants.

10:46.793 --> 10:48.792
Some have parents that'll make
'em do the right thing.

10:48.793 --> 10:50.792
But this little punk-ass so busy
trying to prove he's black,

10:50.793 --> 10:53.792
he goes around having babies 'cause
he thinks that's what black men do.

10:53.793 --> 10:55.793
He's coming.

10:57.892 --> 10:59.892
Girl.

11:04.892 --> 11:05.891
<i>Hola.</i>

11:05.892 --> 11:10.891
<i>Hola, Carlos.</i>

11:10.892 --> 11:12.892
<i>Gracias.</i>

11:23.892 --> 11:26.892
No, no.

11:28.892 --> 11:29.891
Look up the DREAM act.

11:29.892 --> 11:32.891
If you're undocumented,
in college and under 30...

11:32.892 --> 11:34.891
I'm 33.

11:34.892 --> 11:36.892
What... what kind of moisturizer
do you use?

11:38.892 --> 11:39.891
Mm-hmm.

11:39.892 --> 11:41.892
<i>Ciao.</i>

12:55.892 --> 12:57.891
Hey! What are you doing here?

12:57.892 --> 12:58.892
I got the mayor today.

12:59.347 --> 13:00.792
He's going to be
on Cynthia's show.

13:00.892 --> 13:01.891
Mmm.

13:01.892 --> 13:02.891
Before you say it,

13:02.892 --> 13:04.891
he wants to do your show too,

13:04.892 --> 13:06.891
but you...
too controversial.

13:06.892 --> 13:07.891
This is a reelection year.

13:07.892 --> 13:09.891
And if he comes on my show,
he'll get reelected.

13:09.892 --> 13:12.891
Look, I didn't come
to talk about that.

13:12.892 --> 13:14.891
I was running my mouth

13:14.892 --> 13:15.891
and told Tamiko Roberts

13:15.892 --> 13:17.892
about our girls
gone wild night.

13:19.592 --> 13:21.112
Thank you... can't live
without this...

13:21.154 --> 13:23.153
So Tamiko's in town.

13:23.154 --> 13:25.153
Yes.

13:25.154 --> 13:28.153
Hmm... what?

13:28.154 --> 13:29.154
When I was fired,

13:29.155 --> 13:31.524
I was overjoyed that another
black woman got my job.

13:32.154 --> 13:33.954
Uh-huh.

13:33.982 --> 13:34.981
Well, I am now.

13:34.982 --> 13:35.981
Mm-hmm.

13:35.982 --> 13:36.981
Overjoyed.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.581
You know what?

13:38.582 --> 13:39.981
No, I'm glad you
told her to come.

13:39.982 --> 13:40.982
I miss her.

13:41.982 --> 13:42.981
Be nice to catch up.

13:42.982 --> 13:43.981
Catch up?

13:43.982 --> 13:44.981
Girl, I'm trying to cut up.

13:44.982 --> 13:46.981
I can't be perfect
all the time.

13:46.982 --> 13:48.981
You are a hot mess.

13:48.982 --> 13:51.981
Girl, I'm trying to let
this weave breathe... Hey!

13:51.982 --> 13:53.981
Good to see you.

13:53.982 --> 13:55.982
- Look, put your game face on, okay?
- Always.

13:56.108 --> 13:58.192
- See you later.
- Okay.

13:59.982 --> 14:00.982
Hey.

14:01.982 --> 14:04.981
So my nanny called and
she loved our legal segment.

14:04.982 --> 14:06.981
She's calling all her friends,
taking all the credit for it.

14:06.982 --> 14:10.981
Isn't that funny?

14:10.982 --> 14:12.981
Oh... what about the Sheltons?
They made it!

14:12.982 --> 14:15.982
Isn't that great news?

14:18.982 --> 14:19.981
Okay.

14:19.982 --> 14:22.981
Look, I know you don't like me
or want me to work with Mark,

14:22.982 --> 14:25.981
but like I already told you,
I really don't have a choice.

14:25.982 --> 14:26.982
<i>I don't!</i>

14:27.982 --> 14:29.981
Listen, I just want
this whole thing to go away.

14:29.982 --> 14:33.981
Now I know why contracts
are marked in red.

14:33.982 --> 14:35.620
It represents the blood
that's been shed.

14:35.682 --> 14:37.682
I just never thought
it would be my own.

14:37.982 --> 14:39.881
Why are you talking
like a damn mystery movie?

14:39.882 --> 14:40.981
What are you talking about?

14:40.982 --> 14:44.981
I went to Greg to fight
for you to <i>not</i> do Mark's show,

14:44.982 --> 14:46.981
only to find out that you'd
already stabbed me in the back

14:46.982 --> 14:48.981
and used my blood
to ink your new deal!

14:48.982 --> 14:49.981
You went to Greg?

14:49.982 --> 14:51.981
Why would you do that?

14:51.982 --> 14:52.981
Why wouldn't I do that?

14:52.982 --> 14:54.981
It is for the best interest
of our show.

14:54.982 --> 14:56.981
Mary Jane, I'm still
producing our show!

14:56.982 --> 14:58.981
Right, right... we may be
in the same boat,

14:58.982 --> 15:01.062
but clearly you're the only one
wearing a lifejacket.

15:01.982 --> 15:03.981
You know what, I knew
you'd react this way, man.

15:03.982 --> 15:05.981
I really did because
you don't go to "Reason".

15:05.982 --> 15:07.981
You always go to "Mad".

15:07.982 --> 15:09.981
And I am sick and tired
of you always jumping

15:09.982 --> 15:11.981
to the "Angry Black Woman"
of it all.

15:11.982 --> 15:13.981
I didn't say that.

15:13.982 --> 15:14.981
But you do.

15:14.982 --> 15:18.981
You imply it every time you put
me in a position to be angry.

15:18.982 --> 15:19.981
Oh, my goodness.

15:19.982 --> 15:23.981
And while we're on the topic
of angry black women,

15:23.982 --> 15:25.981
let me be very clear.

15:25.982 --> 15:29.982
When you're messing
with my money, I'm not angry.

15:30.380 --> 15:31.379
I'm pissed!

15:31.380 --> 15:32.380
One minute to air.

15:32.440 --> 15:34.121
Clear set, please.

15:44.587 --> 15:45.586
Hi, Dad.

15:45.587 --> 15:47.587
Hey, baby.

15:47.703 --> 15:49.702
You look wonderful.

15:49.703 --> 15:51.703
Thank you.

15:56.703 --> 15:57.703
What?

15:59.703 --> 16:01.702
Thank you for being a reminder.

16:01.703 --> 16:02.702
Ah.

16:02.703 --> 16:05.702
What do you say
we get you a drink?

16:05.703 --> 16:06.702
Please.

16:06.703 --> 16:09.702
Thomas, the lady will have
a ginger margarita

16:09.703 --> 16:12.702
and please make sure
the ginger is fresh

16:12.703 --> 16:14.702
and I'll have my usual.

16:14.703 --> 16:15.703
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

16:17.703 --> 16:20.526
You remember when you used to
let me order Shirley Temples?

16:20.703 --> 16:22.703
Do I ever...
I miss those days.

16:23.703 --> 16:26.703
So, did you get Mom
to take that drive?

16:27.703 --> 16:30.702
No, no.

16:30.703 --> 16:34.702
There are days when I think
I might be getting her back

16:34.703 --> 16:36.703
and then it's like she's been
gone for 20 years

16:37.703 --> 16:39.702
and I'm waiting for her
to come home.

16:39.703 --> 16:41.702
You're patient.

16:41.703 --> 16:42.702
No...

16:42.703 --> 16:43.702
No, no, no.

16:43.703 --> 16:46.702
I'm married!

16:46.703 --> 16:48.702
You know, it's funny.

16:48.703 --> 16:50.702
When you hear people
talk about marriage,

16:50.703 --> 16:54.702
it's always about the suffering
and the sacrifices.

16:54.703 --> 16:57.702
I'm not sure why we're all
rushing to get there.

16:57.703 --> 17:00.702
Well, you see,
it's all the little things

17:00.703 --> 17:03.622
that we often forget about

17:03.703 --> 17:06.702
and couldn't live without
if they came up missing.

17:06.703 --> 17:08.702
Would you marry her
all over again?

17:08.703 --> 17:10.703
In a heartbeat.

17:12.703 --> 17:14.702
You know what?

17:14.703 --> 17:17.702
I can't wait for the guy
who wants to marry you

17:17.703 --> 17:20.702
to call me up and ask
for your hand in marriage.

17:20.703 --> 17:24.702
I'm gonna give him
such a hard time.

17:24.703 --> 17:27.702
So you really think
it would be that traditional?

17:27.703 --> 17:29.702
It better!

17:29.703 --> 17:33.703
You are my little girl
and you deserve the best.

17:35.703 --> 17:37.702
Right?

17:37.703 --> 17:38.702
Right.

17:38.703 --> 17:40.703
Right.

17:43.703 --> 17:44.702
Kathryn?

17:44.703 --> 17:46.531
I thought that was you, Paul.

17:46.703 --> 17:47.702
Well, how are you?

17:47.703 --> 17:48.702
Oh, please,
please... sit.

17:48.703 --> 17:51.702
I don't want to interrupt anything,
but I did want to stop by and say hi.

17:51.703 --> 17:53.702
Good to see you.

17:53.703 --> 17:54.702
And Pauletta.

17:54.703 --> 17:56.702
It's great to see you again,
Mrs. Stepford.

17:56.703 --> 17:59.702
Oh, honey, you're older now
and I'm divorced.

17:59.703 --> 18:01.702
Just Kathryn.

18:01.703 --> 18:02.702
Okay.

18:02.703 --> 18:04.702
So how's Helen?

18:04.703 --> 18:07.703
Fine.
Well, she's not doing too well.

18:09.920 --> 18:12.926
Well, look, I should have been
over to see her long ago.

18:13.119 --> 18:15.702
But if you'll have me, I'd
love to come by and see her.

18:15.703 --> 18:17.702
Fine, drop by any time.

18:17.703 --> 18:18.702
House still the same?

18:18.703 --> 18:20.702
Still the same.

18:20.703 --> 18:21.702
Well, then.

18:21.703 --> 18:23.702
Expect to see me.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.702
Look forward to it.

18:25.703 --> 18:28.702
Enjoy your dinner, please.

18:28.703 --> 18:30.702
Bye bye, Kathryn.

18:30.703 --> 18:33.703
Bye bye, Kathryn.

18:40.703 --> 18:45.702
You know she wants to do nasty
things to you, right, Dad?

18:45.703 --> 18:49.702
Well, I think we should
tell her to get in line.

18:49.703 --> 18:50.702
Wrong answer!

18:50.703 --> 18:51.702
Wrong!

18:51.703 --> 18:53.703
Perfect timing, thank you.

19:14.703 --> 19:20.702
"The woman who catches
a man's eye earns a purse.

19:20.703 --> 19:24.703
"The woman who captures
his heart earns his world."

19:45.703 --> 19:47.702
...Bottom line:

19:47.703 --> 19:48.702
She should have told me.

19:48.703 --> 19:50.702
Yes, okay, she should
have told you.

19:50.703 --> 19:53.702
See, the sad thing is that
Kara may be my only lifeline

19:53.703 --> 19:54.702
to saving my show.

19:54.703 --> 19:57.702
And keep me happy 'cause
I'm so high-maintenance.

19:57.703 --> 19:58.702
True.

19:58.703 --> 20:01.702
Don't you have a style blog
or something to go...

20:01.703 --> 20:04.702
Is that the gayest excuse
you can come up with

20:04.703 --> 20:05.702
to get me to leave?

20:05.703 --> 20:06.702
See you later.

20:06.703 --> 20:08.703
Dismissed.

20:10.703 --> 20:13.702
Oh, boy.

20:13.703 --> 20:15.702
Seriously, Mark, seriously.

20:15.703 --> 20:16.702
Yeah?

20:16.703 --> 20:20.702
Is your show
in that much trouble?

20:20.703 --> 20:23.702
Yeah, it is.

20:23.703 --> 20:25.702
That's the news, I guess, huh?

20:25.703 --> 20:27.702
Whoa...
hold up.

20:27.703 --> 20:29.702
What?

20:29.703 --> 20:31.702
That's a nice wedding band.

20:31.703 --> 20:32.702
Yeah.

20:32.703 --> 20:34.702
I don't think I've ever
noticed you wear it before.

20:34.703 --> 20:35.702
What do you mean?

20:35.703 --> 20:37.702
I put it on every Friday night.

20:37.703 --> 20:38.702
Really?
Yeah.

20:38.703 --> 20:39.702
Hmm.

20:39.703 --> 20:41.702
Have you ever forgotten to take if
off before you come back to work?

20:41.703 --> 20:44.702
Ooh, no... no, no. Don't
forget to take it off.

20:44.703 --> 20:46.702
You know, I don't know.

20:46.703 --> 20:48.702
Maybe Georgia will pass
a gay marriage law

20:48.703 --> 20:51.702
and then I'll have a chance to feel what
it feels like to wear it like my parents.

20:51.703 --> 20:55.702
"Bee-beh,"
this is the South!

20:55.703 --> 20:57.702
You laugh, but you
and the rainbow team

20:57.703 --> 21:00.702
are more likely
to get married before me.

21:00.703 --> 21:02.702
Which I'm starting to embrace.

21:02.703 --> 21:04.702
I don't think
I want to get married.

21:04.703 --> 21:07.702
It may not be for me.

21:07.703 --> 21:10.702
Maybe marriage is just
something I say I want

21:10.703 --> 21:12.702
because I'm supposed to say it.

21:12.703 --> 21:13.702
You know?

21:13.703 --> 21:17.702
Like I'm a damn trained seal.

21:17.703 --> 21:19.702
Just give...
me... marriage!

21:19.703 --> 21:20.702
Ar ar ar!

21:20.703 --> 21:21.702
I want marriage!

21:21.703 --> 21:23.702
You have clearly had
one too many of these,

21:23.703 --> 21:25.703
so we'll put this here.

21:27.703 --> 21:30.702
Hey... There are my girls!

21:30.703 --> 21:32.703
Oh my goodness, oh my goodness.

21:33.703 --> 21:34.702
Hi, hi, hi.

21:34.703 --> 21:35.702
Where is everybody?

21:35.703 --> 21:37.702
My dad's cooking.

21:37.703 --> 21:38.702
Grandma's upstairs.

21:38.703 --> 21:39.702
Grandpa's golfing.

21:39.703 --> 21:42.702
Oh, and where's your sister?

21:42.703 --> 21:44.702
She's upstairs crying.

21:44.703 --> 21:45.702
Really...
why?

21:45.703 --> 21:47.702
Her boyfriend didn't take her
to the doctor.

21:47.703 --> 21:48.703
Oh.

21:50.703 --> 21:51.702
Hey.

21:51.703 --> 21:52.702
Hey.

21:52.703 --> 21:54.702
So what happened?

21:54.703 --> 21:55.702
I heard from
your youngest daughter

21:55.703 --> 21:57.702
that your middle daughter
missed her appointment

21:57.703 --> 21:58.702
for your granddaughter.

21:58.703 --> 22:00.702
Very funny.

22:00.703 --> 22:02.702
Dante never
showed up yesterday.

22:02.703 --> 22:03.702
My God, you guys,

22:03.703 --> 22:05.702
Lisa did us a favor
by taking her as a patient.

22:05.703 --> 22:07.333
<i>I</i> took her to the appointment.

22:07.503 --> 22:08.702
Why didn't you just say that?

22:08.703 --> 22:11.208
I was trying to express to you
that your niece had a rough day.

22:11.703 --> 22:12.702
Her heart is broken,

22:12.703 --> 22:14.703
in case you want
to talk to her.

22:16.703 --> 22:18.702
What are you making?

22:18.703 --> 22:19.702
Gumbo.

22:19.703 --> 22:20.702
We got company.

22:20.703 --> 22:22.702
Who?

22:22.703 --> 22:23.703
Some friend of Mom's.

22:24.703 --> 22:27.703
She's in the living room with
Dad waiting on Mom to come down.

22:33.703 --> 22:34.703
You are still the same.

22:35.703 --> 22:36.703
Hey, baby.
Oh, hi.

22:39.703 --> 22:40.702
You remember Kathryn...

22:40.703 --> 22:43.702
Yeah, from last night...
so soon to visit!

22:43.703 --> 22:46.702
Oh, I'm a woman of action,
dare I say, like you.

22:46.703 --> 22:48.702
Hmm.

22:48.703 --> 22:50.702
The kids thought
you were golfing.

22:50.703 --> 22:51.702
I don't know why...
I've been back a while.

22:51.703 --> 22:53.703
Maybe because you're
tucked away back here.

22:56.703 --> 22:57.702
So how's your show?

22:57.703 --> 22:59.702
Good.

22:59.703 --> 23:01.702
Kathryn, darling.

23:01.703 --> 23:02.702
How are you?

23:02.703 --> 23:05.703
Long time, no see, Helen.

23:06.703 --> 23:09.703
Well, that's how it works when
you don't want to be seen.

23:11.703 --> 23:13.259
I miss that sense
of humor of yours.

23:13.581 --> 23:14.702
Oh, it's so good to see you.

23:14.703 --> 23:17.702
This means a lot
that you stopped by.

23:17.703 --> 23:20.702
Forgive the house...

23:20.703 --> 23:22.702
I think I'll go see her
through this.

23:22.703 --> 23:24.703
Mm-hmm.

23:32.703 --> 23:33.702
Stop.

23:33.703 --> 23:36.602
- Sophia.
- Stop!

23:36.603 --> 23:37.702
Don't irritate your brother.

23:37.703 --> 23:38.784
Hey, Hunter...
come on, man.

23:39.361 --> 23:40.720
- Pick your bag up.
- Sorry.

24:07.703 --> 24:08.702
Hey, baby...
Go!

24:08.703 --> 24:10.702
Get out of here!

24:10.703 --> 24:13.702
Go! Go! Go!

24:13.703 --> 24:14.702
Just get out of here!

24:14.703 --> 24:16.702
Get out!

24:16.703 --> 24:19.703
Get out!

24:32.703 --> 24:35.703
I'm sure you didn't come up here
for a beauty tip.

24:39.703 --> 24:42.703
Would it kill you to go
for a drive with Daddy?

24:43.703 --> 24:45.702
It might.

24:45.703 --> 24:48.703
You know, Kathryn didn't come over
here with the best intentions.

24:49.703 --> 24:52.702
What else is new?

24:52.703 --> 24:54.703
They used to wait
until you were dead.

24:56.703 --> 25:00.702
Today's vultures smell blood
before you even say, "I do."

25:00.703 --> 25:04.702
They could never
cultivate a man,

25:04.703 --> 25:11.702
so it's easier for them
to just take someone else's.

25:11.703 --> 25:12.702
You okay?

25:12.703 --> 25:15.702
Mm-hmm, yeah,
I caught a little chill.

25:15.703 --> 25:17.702
Oh, please, don't tell me
we so broke now

25:17.703 --> 25:19.702
we can't afford
to pay for heat.

25:19.703 --> 25:21.702
Mom.

25:21.703 --> 25:24.703
No speeches.

25:26.703 --> 25:30.702
Hand me that photograph of me.

25:30.703 --> 25:33.702
Not the one of the retirement.

25:33.703 --> 25:36.703
The one with my legs out.

25:37.703 --> 25:39.703
Mm-hmm.

25:43.703 --> 25:47.702
Oh, shake it, Miss Lucy.

25:47.703 --> 25:51.703
Now, if the old me was
to walk into a room

25:52.703 --> 25:56.702
with the you of today,

25:56.703 --> 26:00.703
all you could do
is to hold my purse, baby.

26:04.703 --> 26:05.703
Oh, but she didn't know

26:06.703 --> 26:10.702
that a disease was gonna
take hold of her life.

26:10.703 --> 26:13.702
She was just being promoted
to high school principal

26:13.703 --> 26:17.702
and her man just bought
his dream car.

26:17.703 --> 26:21.703
Walked right into a dealership
and paid cash.

26:25.703 --> 26:29.702
Your father.

26:29.703 --> 26:35.703
How he loved to see my legs
pour out of that Porsche of his.

26:36.703 --> 26:39.703
It's not the ride he loves.

26:40.703 --> 26:43.702
It's all the stops he made,

26:43.703 --> 26:46.703
just to see me
get out of his car.

26:52.703 --> 26:53.703
Put it away.

27:24.703 --> 27:26.703
Put this up for me, baby.

27:51.930 --> 27:53.188
Tamiko!

27:53.247 --> 27:55.147
It's so good to see you.

27:55.173 --> 27:56.173
My gosh.

27:56.299 --> 27:57.298
You look so good.

27:57.299 --> 28:00.298
Oh, stop stealing my words.
Look at you.

28:00.299 --> 28:02.298
I'm really glad
you could make it.

28:02.299 --> 28:05.298
I'm really happy to be here.

28:05.299 --> 28:06.299
Aaaah.

28:07.051 --> 28:09.298
Well, the other girls are inside.
Go join them.

28:09.299 --> 28:11.299
Okay.

28:15.299 --> 28:16.298
Hey.

28:16.299 --> 28:18.299
Hey.

28:27.299 --> 28:29.298
What you want me
to do with this?

28:29.299 --> 28:32.299
Crack you over
the head with it?

28:32.432 --> 28:33.431
Okay.

28:33.432 --> 28:35.431
I screwed up.

28:35.432 --> 28:37.431
I should have told you
the whole truth,

28:37.432 --> 28:41.431
regardless of me
having no choice.

28:41.432 --> 28:44.431
You didn't have to find out from
Greg that I took the position.

28:44.432 --> 28:47.431
You deserve better than that.

28:47.432 --> 28:48.431
Uh!

28:48.432 --> 28:51.431
Come on, I just Robert Downey
Juniored the moment!

28:51.432 --> 28:53.431
I copped to my wrongdoing.

28:53.432 --> 28:58.431
You gotta look into my puppy dog
eyes and you gotta forgive me.

28:58.432 --> 29:01.431
I have kids that need
a nanny, for crying out loud!

29:01.432 --> 29:03.431
I'm sorry!

29:03.432 --> 29:04.431
Sorry.

29:04.432 --> 29:05.431
Thank you.

29:05.432 --> 29:07.432
You're welcome.

29:15.267 --> 29:16.431
You guys, it's the cops!

29:16.432 --> 29:17.431
It's the cops!

29:17.432 --> 29:19.431
Why...
What the hell?

29:19.432 --> 29:20.431
Shh, you guys.

29:20.432 --> 29:26.431
Why would the cops be here?

29:26.432 --> 29:29.432
Um, something I could
help you with, officer?

29:50.432 --> 29:54.431
Finally got those kids down.

29:54.432 --> 29:58.432
I think I should probably go
to a hotel, Avery.

30:02.475 --> 30:05.431
I remember
when I first met you.

30:05.432 --> 30:09.432
You were just
this corny guy in sales

30:10.432 --> 30:13.432
who drove a raggedy Mercedes.

30:15.432 --> 30:18.431
I built you.

30:18.432 --> 30:19.431
You what?

30:19.432 --> 30:22.431
No more raggedy car, huh?

30:22.432 --> 30:25.431
No, I made you into somebody
other women want.

30:25.432 --> 30:27.431
Now, listen, that's bull...

30:27.432 --> 30:29.431
What do I get in return?

30:29.432 --> 30:32.431
So you're the real winner
in all of this.

30:32.432 --> 30:35.432
If we got divorced,
then you'd have her.

30:35.475 --> 30:38.431
Did you ever stop
to think about me?

30:38.432 --> 30:39.431
Who I'd get?

30:39.432 --> 30:41.431
Hmm? Hmm?

30:41.432 --> 30:43.431
Who is going to want me
with two kids

30:43.432 --> 30:45.431
and a stomach full
of stretch marks... who?

30:45.432 --> 30:47.431
Lower your voice, okay...
The kids are sleeping.

30:47.432 --> 30:48.431
Who is going to want this?

30:48.432 --> 30:50.431
Who is gonna
want this... look at this!

30:50.432 --> 30:55.431
Who is going to want this?

30:55.432 --> 30:59.431
You said they were beautiful.

30:59.432 --> 31:02.431
They're not that beautiful when
I'm trying to find my kids another daddy.

31:02.432 --> 31:06.432
The kids have a daddy, okay?

31:18.231 --> 31:19.431
Oh, that's mine...
that's mine.

31:19.432 --> 31:22.431
Okay, first you take my job,
then you take my drink.

31:22.432 --> 31:24.431
Oh!

31:24.432 --> 31:26.431
Here we go!

31:26.432 --> 31:27.431
Hold on.

31:27.432 --> 31:29.431
None of that, girl.

31:29.432 --> 31:32.431
I'm just speaking the truth,
just speaking the truth.

31:32.432 --> 31:35.431
Mary Jane, do we need
to have this out, mmm?

31:35.432 --> 31:36.431
Have a pillow fight?

31:36.432 --> 31:37.431
What do we need to do?

31:37.432 --> 31:39.431
Give me your job
at the "Today" show.

31:39.432 --> 31:40.431
Congratulations.

31:40.432 --> 31:42.043
I meant to email you
on that promotion.

31:42.432 --> 31:44.431
And you getting married!

31:44.432 --> 31:46.431
Show me your ring!

31:46.432 --> 31:47.432
Oh, my gosh!

31:48.432 --> 31:49.431
Look at that, you guys.

31:49.432 --> 31:50.431
Gorgeous.

31:50.432 --> 31:52.431
I see it way down here...
it's huge.

31:52.432 --> 31:53.431
Gorgeous!

31:53.432 --> 31:54.432
Whose bag is this?

31:55.432 --> 31:56.431
That's mine.

31:56.432 --> 31:57.431
So pretty.

31:57.432 --> 32:00.431
Where did you get
all that yummy?

32:00.432 --> 32:02.431
What?

32:02.432 --> 32:04.388
Oh, well, hey. Twist
my arm, why don't you?

32:04.432 --> 32:05.431
Just spill it.

32:05.432 --> 32:06.431
He was 6'2".

32:06.432 --> 32:08.431
Gorgeous.

32:08.432 --> 32:10.431
And has exquisite taste.

32:10.432 --> 32:12.431
You didn't tell us anything!

32:12.432 --> 32:13.431
Come on!
And...

32:13.432 --> 32:16.431
he's married.

32:16.432 --> 32:17.864
Oh, so you're a homewrecker.

32:18.431 --> 32:20.431
You actually celebrate
the destruction of families.

32:20.432 --> 32:23.431
Actually, quite the opposite.

32:23.432 --> 32:25.431
I believe I'm saving
his marriage.

32:25.432 --> 32:27.431
Really?

32:27.432 --> 32:30.431
See, I'm not so much
as "the other woman"

32:30.432 --> 32:33.431
as I am more of,
how do you say,

32:33.432 --> 32:35.432
modern-day geisha.

32:36.432 --> 32:39.431
- And what do you get out of it?
- Mmm!

32:39.432 --> 32:41.431
I get showered
with gifts and trips

32:41.432 --> 32:44.431
and sexy text messages all day.

32:44.432 --> 32:45.431
Regular sex.

32:45.432 --> 32:46.431
I get to kick his butt out
before morning

32:46.432 --> 32:50.431
and the best part is that
he doesn't crowd my space

32:50.432 --> 32:53.431
or mess up my all
white-on-white home dÐ¹cor.

32:53.432 --> 32:55.431
It's a good life.

32:55.432 --> 32:56.432
Oh, come on.

32:57.111 --> 32:59.431
So I'm the only one who's had
an affair with a married man?

32:59.432 --> 33:00.431
Yeah.

33:00.432 --> 33:04.431
Really?

33:04.432 --> 33:05.431
Don't look at me!

33:05.432 --> 33:07.431
So this is where we're at?

33:07.432 --> 33:12.431
Where affairs are just
chit chat at a party?

33:12.432 --> 33:13.431
I'm sorry, Kara.

33:13.432 --> 33:14.431
Hey.

33:14.432 --> 33:16.431
John had every right to cheat.

33:16.432 --> 33:19.431
I was never home.

33:19.432 --> 33:24.431
And Darryl will always
remain devoted.

33:24.432 --> 33:27.431
All right, I've had it up to
here with all this affair talk.

33:27.432 --> 33:29.431
Anybody else have
any dirty laundry?

33:29.432 --> 33:30.432
See, that's how you do.

33:31.432 --> 33:32.431
You get us all over here

33:32.432 --> 33:34.431
and get us drunk
so you can get all of it.

33:34.432 --> 33:36.431
That's true!

33:36.432 --> 33:37.431
That's a little truth.

33:37.432 --> 33:38.432
Little truth.

33:39.432 --> 33:40.432
You're welcome.

33:42.432 --> 33:43.431
Lisa, you're up.

33:43.432 --> 33:44.431
Spotlight's on you, boo.

33:44.432 --> 33:46.431
Come on.

33:46.432 --> 33:48.431
I didn't vote for Obama.

33:48.432 --> 33:49.431
What?

33:49.432 --> 33:50.431
What?

33:50.432 --> 33:53.431
I'm that 1% that doesn't want
to pay higher taxes!

33:53.432 --> 33:55.431
Yes!
Thank you!

33:55.432 --> 33:57.431
Oh, you think you know people!

33:57.432 --> 33:58.431
And...

33:58.432 --> 34:00.431
I bought weed from your brother

34:00.432 --> 34:02.432
and I smoked it
in your bathroom!

34:03.432 --> 34:04.431
Don't do that!

34:04.432 --> 34:07.432
All y'all heifers been buying
weed from my brother, stop.

34:08.431 --> 34:10.431
Just say no.

34:10.431 --> 34:12.431
What else you got?

34:12.431 --> 34:14.431
Mama got laid last night.

34:16.431 --> 34:17.431
It's Carlos, the intern.

34:17.431 --> 34:18.431
Shut up.

34:18.431 --> 34:19.431
Yes!

34:19.431 --> 34:20.431
And he's a Latino!

34:20.431 --> 34:22.431
I know! I know!

34:22.431 --> 34:24.431
I actually think I'm coming back
to my people.

34:24.431 --> 34:26.431
Coming back to the motherland,
I see you.

34:26.431 --> 34:28.431
Ay-yi-yi!

34:29.431 --> 34:30.857
Bet you can't top that, Tamiko.

34:33.431 --> 34:34.431
I paid for my ring

34:34.431 --> 34:37.431
and I'm afraid it's gonna
ruin my marriage.

34:42.431 --> 34:44.431
I should have just taken
the ring that he gave me,

34:45.431 --> 34:47.431
but no, I had to go out
and buy this one.

34:49.431 --> 34:51.431
I just can't believe
I emasculated him like that

34:51.431 --> 34:54.431
and thought it would be okay.

34:54.431 --> 34:58.432
I love him and
I don't want to lose him.

34:59.432 --> 35:01.431
It's hard out there, ladies.

35:01.432 --> 35:04.431
When you find a good man,

35:04.432 --> 35:08.431
just be happy with the ring
that he gives you.

35:08.432 --> 35:10.432
News at 11.

35:12.432 --> 35:15.432
Tamiko.

35:16.432 --> 35:18.431
Just tell him what you told us.

35:18.432 --> 35:20.432
Everything's going to be okay.

35:25.432 --> 35:26.431
What?

35:26.432 --> 35:28.431
Mmm?

35:28.432 --> 35:30.431
You see, you're standing over
there gaining five pounds

35:30.432 --> 35:32.431
to avoid opening your mouth.

35:32.432 --> 35:34.431
Mm-hmm.
Mmm-hm.

35:34.432 --> 35:36.431
But this party ain't over
until we get some dirt on you.

35:36.432 --> 35:37.431
Oh yeah, yeah.

35:37.432 --> 35:39.432
Spill it...
<i>you</i> spill it.

35:41.432 --> 35:43.432
Come on with it, waiting!

35:46.432 --> 35:48.432
What is she doing?

35:49.432 --> 35:50.431
What is she doing?

35:50.432 --> 35:52.432
What are you doing?

36:05.432 --> 36:07.432
What the hell is that?

36:11.189 --> 36:12.332
David's sperm.

36:12.432 --> 36:14.431
What?!
Oh! Ohh!

36:14.432 --> 36:17.432
That's crazy.

36:18.432 --> 36:20.431
That's really sperm?

36:20.432 --> 36:21.432
Yes.

36:22.432 --> 36:25.332
And I am not proud of myself,
but, hey, I did it.

36:25.360 --> 36:27.359
And there's no point in being
shame-faced about it now.

36:27.360 --> 36:29.660
- How did you get it?
- We got to find you a man quick.

36:29.725 --> 36:31.725
You are one bold chick, a'ight?

36:32.725 --> 36:38.025
I mean, move over, Rachel Maddow
and hello, Mary Jane Paul.

36:38.051 --> 36:40.050
You're welcome.

36:40.051 --> 36:43.050
I've always been mystified
about how your mind works.

36:43.051 --> 36:47.050
But I mean, to Mary Jane's
beautiful mind.

36:47.051 --> 36:49.050
Yes.
Okay.

36:49.051 --> 36:52.050
Yes, yes.

36:52.051 --> 36:55.050
Are we that out of touch?

36:55.051 --> 36:58.050
Is our friendship so lopsided
that you can help me,

36:58.051 --> 37:00.050
but you won't reach out to me

37:00.051 --> 37:02.050
when you do something
so insanely desperate.

37:02.051 --> 37:04.051
You smoke weed, saint.

37:04.289 --> 37:07.050
Look, I didn't want to tell you because
I didn't want to hear you say,

37:07.051 --> 37:10.050
"Wait for God to send you a man

37:10.051 --> 37:12.050
"so that you can then
have a baby."

37:12.051 --> 37:13.050
Then adopt.

37:13.051 --> 37:16.050
Otherwise, that's just
how it works, Mary Jane.

37:16.051 --> 37:19.051
And it won't work anyway,
because you froze it wrong.

37:20.051 --> 37:21.050
I know.

37:21.051 --> 37:24.051
Otherwise, my secret would
have been I'm pregnant.

37:32.051 --> 37:34.050
No, no, no.

37:34.051 --> 37:36.050
Our problem is you think I'm
something you dressed up

37:36.051 --> 37:38.050
that you can fit in your
perfect little dollhouse.

37:38.051 --> 37:39.050
Okay?

37:39.051 --> 37:41.050
For years I've been screaming
at you for you to see me...

37:41.051 --> 37:43.051
Don't blame me for your affair.

37:44.051 --> 37:46.051
Come on.

37:47.051 --> 37:48.051
It's her, isn't it?

37:51.051 --> 37:53.050
Now, don't make no pit stops.

37:53.051 --> 37:55.050
Go straight home!

37:55.051 --> 37:57.051
You cannot make me
the perfect doting husband

37:58.010 --> 37:59.050
who got the perfect career

37:59.051 --> 38:01.050
and whose cute kids
got into private school.

38:01.051 --> 38:02.050
So who are you?

38:02.051 --> 38:05.051
Who am I?

38:08.051 --> 38:11.050
I'm a husband who still comes on to my
wife even when she's on her period.

38:11.051 --> 38:12.050
Oh, God.

38:12.051 --> 38:13.050
That's who I am.

38:13.051 --> 38:14.091
That's what this is about?

38:15.051 --> 38:16.050
This is about sex.
Ah ha!

38:16.051 --> 38:18.050
When was the last time
you came on to me, huh?

38:18.051 --> 38:20.050
When's the last time
you came on to me?

38:20.051 --> 38:22.050
When is the last time
you came on to me?

38:22.051 --> 38:24.050
It was our vacation
in Anguilla.

38:24.051 --> 38:25.050
Anguilla!

38:25.051 --> 38:26.051
God.

38:28.051 --> 38:30.987
- What?
- You going to go back
to your whore?

38:31.051 --> 38:32.050
Get out of here!

38:32.051 --> 38:34.050
Go!

38:34.051 --> 38:35.051
Get out!

38:36.051 --> 38:38.050
Look, I don't know what
you're complaining about.

38:38.051 --> 38:40.050
We have sex all the time.

38:40.051 --> 38:43.050
Ha... whose world?

38:43.051 --> 38:45.050
When we have sex, it's like
you're doing me a favor.

38:45.051 --> 38:46.050
It's still sex.

38:46.051 --> 38:48.050
No, it's not still sex.

38:48.051 --> 38:50.051
Yeah.

38:54.051 --> 38:58.051
I have asked you for years
to wake up and give me a hand.

38:58.781 --> 38:59.821
Some people find it nice...

39:00.065 --> 39:01.947
Andre, who wants to put
a penis in their mouth

39:01.948 --> 39:04.781
first thing
in the morning... who?

39:05.038 --> 39:06.037
For years!

39:06.038 --> 39:08.037
Years!
For what?

39:08.038 --> 39:09.180
- What?
- Is that hard?
