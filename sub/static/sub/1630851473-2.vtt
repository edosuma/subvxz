Job-lot, eBay.

01:18.800 --> 01:20.640
Whose bright idea was this?

01:22.560 --> 01:25.560
You do know the correlation between
repetitive head injuries and

01:25.600 --> 01:26.680
early onset dementia?

01:26.720 --> 01:27.960
That's what training's for.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.600
Here.

01:32.640 --> 01:33.880
No, they'll fix it upstairs.

01:33.920 --> 01:37.760
If it's not done right, I could
break anything. Again, training.

01:37.800 --> 01:40.320
Couldn't you have found a
passion for chess?

01:40.360 --> 01:42.720
The Chess society are
riddled with crabs.

01:42.760 --> 01:43.760
Oh be serious, Flick.

01:43.800 --> 01:46.760
Oh I am. Stuff they do with
their rooks is pure filth.

01:46.800 --> 01:48.680
It's public domain.

01:48.720 --> 01:50.840
Nobody ran boxing past me.

01:50.880 --> 01:54.560
You should just think yourself lucky
that she let me invite you tonight.

01:54.600 --> 01:57.280
You do not need your Mum's
permission to see me!

01:57.320 --> 02:00.240
No, I just need Maggy to
squeeze me into your 'slots'.

02:00.280 --> 02:02.720
Look, Maggy doesn't talk
to you like that.

02:02.760 --> 02:04.600
Nope. But that's what it
always sounds like.

02:04.640 --> 02:08.160
Which is why you need
to be nice to Jeff.

02:09.080 --> 02:10.480
Jeff?!

02:10.520 --> 02:13.400
If I ran every hobby past you Pops,
you'd die on your feet.

02:13.440 --> 02:16.920
His company put shedloads of
money into places like this.

02:18.800 --> 02:21.720
He's here, right?

02:21.760 --> 02:23.200
Don't make it weird.

02:28.120 --> 02:30.760
Dad, this is Jeff.

02:30.800 --> 02:33.840
He suggested boxing as a way for
me to embrace female rage.

02:33.880 --> 02:37.120
Whoa! 'Rage' and 'female'
are her words.

02:37.160 --> 02:38.760
My quote's
'Blowing the cobwebs out.'

02:38.800 --> 02:41.600
Which is great for 99 percent
of people, don't you think?

02:41.640 --> 02:44.320
Anyway, good to finally meet you,
Wolfe.

02:44.360 --> 02:46.520
I've heard tons about you.

02:46.560 --> 02:48.480
Now I know why Flick's right hook's
so impressive.

02:50.320 --> 02:51.600
Excuse me.

02:52.480 --> 02:54.560
Maggy?
'I don't know why I'm here-'

02:54.600 --> 02:56.280
Yeah.
'But I'm here.'

02:56.320 --> 02:57.640
No, no, of course.

02:58.640 --> 02:59.880
Hey, Maggy's outside.

02:59.920 --> 03:02.600
Um, I'm on my way down. Now, yeah.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.560
There'd be more chance of us
spending time together

03:05.600 --> 03:07.320
if I turned up on a slab
at this rate.

03:07.360 --> 03:09.080
Well, you got talked into the
right hobby

03:09.120 --> 03:10.720
for speeding the chances of that up.

03:13.880 --> 03:15.680
This is important to her.

03:15.720 --> 03:18.320
Oh give him a break, work's work.
We know what he does.

03:18.360 --> 03:20.600
They're taping it anyway,
so we can email you a copy.

03:20.640 --> 03:22.080
Fuck off!

03:22.120 --> 03:23.480
Wolfe!

03:28.040 --> 03:29.880
What's the emergency?

03:29.920 --> 03:32.400
Val invited a date.

03:33.240 --> 03:34.440
Jeff's not a 'date'.

03:35.720 --> 03:37.880
Seriously, if that's
the only reason you called me out,

03:37.920 --> 03:39.840
I'm taking you back.
I will not watch the daughter

03:39.880 --> 03:42.320
that almost died, take impact
injuries to the head

03:42.360 --> 03:45.040
because some over-athletic gimp
thinks

03:45.080 --> 03:46.880
she's got fucking
cobwebs at her age!

03:50.440 --> 03:52.280
And nobody asked me.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.360
There we go!

04:00.000 --> 04:01.840
Where are the others?
Round at Dot's.

04:01.880 --> 04:03.640
Well, that's where we're off.

04:08.840 --> 04:10.080
What the hell is that?

04:11.200 --> 04:13.480
There's no movement,
so it's not a silent rave.

04:15.120 --> 04:16.600
Pull over.

04:16.640 --> 04:17.840
But not on the bridge.

04:27.880 --> 04:30.160
Wolfe! Has it been dumped?

04:31.440 --> 04:33.640
No! There might be someone in it.

04:43.040 --> 04:45.720
Get the services Maggy!
I'm on it.

04:45.760 --> 04:48.760
It's Maggy Chan from Forensics.
Hang on let me catch my breath.

04:48.800 --> 04:51.040
We're at an RTC,
it's a car off a bridge.

04:51.080 --> 04:53.320
Maggy -
I'll send you the exact location.

04:53.360 --> 04:56.320
We'll need USAR, paramedics,
and don’t hate me... Divers.

04:57.520 --> 04:59.800
Look - the driver's out. Footprints.

04:59.840 --> 05:01.600
Hey, "We don't risk a
life to save a life".

05:01.640 --> 05:04.040
It's your own echo, Boss.
See if anyone else needs help.

05:04.080 --> 05:05.240
Wolfe, I can smell fuel.

05:05.280 --> 05:08.440
Yeah, I can see it, it's all shifting
away from the engine. Just go!

05:39.360 --> 05:40.600
Travel well.

05:44.560 --> 05:46.360
Listen,

05:46.400 --> 05:49.320
I know it seems indecent,

05:49.360 --> 05:53.160
to be asking this soon,
but I badly need your help.

05:53.200 --> 05:57.320
To find out what piece of shit left
you here to die on your own.

06:26.520 --> 06:27.920
'Maggy?'

06:27.960 --> 06:29.160
Services are en-route.

06:29.200 --> 06:32.120
'We've got a deceased female
in the passenger seat.'

06:32.160 --> 06:33.760
'Teenager, early twenties.'

06:33.800 --> 06:35.160
'What're we seeing over there?'

06:35.200 --> 06:37.120
We've got footprints but only
down to the river,

06:37.160 --> 06:39.040
'but they're erratic.
I'm not seeing blood..

06:39.080 --> 06:40.520
Meaning dogs?

06:40.560 --> 06:43.560
Well, they're swerving away from the
water, back under the bridge.

06:43.600 --> 06:44.720
Olivia!

06:47.600 --> 06:49.440
Stay back!

06:49.480 --> 06:52.080
Way back, please! Look,
there's nothing to see here, folks.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.720
That's our car.

06:53.760 --> 06:55.440
Joseph, that's our...

06:55.480 --> 06:58.800
Oh my God. Oh, my God. Olivia!

06:58.840 --> 07:00.800
Emergency's are on their way.
Did she call you here?

07:00.840 --> 07:03.160
Missed curfew. Three hours.

07:03.200 --> 07:04.440
We tracked her phone.

07:04.480 --> 07:06.680
We don't know how safe the
vehicle is, please, please...

07:06.720 --> 07:08.680
Claudia,

07:08.720 --> 07:10.160
she got out.

07:10.200 --> 07:11.320
She's out!

07:11.360 --> 07:13.240
The prints lead us away from
the water, thank God.

07:13.280 --> 07:16.280
Can you give me a photo of her to
share with the main services?

07:16.320 --> 07:18.680
What's he do?
I'm Professor Kinteh.

07:18.720 --> 07:20.440
We're forensic
workers from the university.

07:20.480 --> 07:21.960
We happened to be
first on the scene.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.960
All highway patrols
should have her picture, Sir.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.120
Joseph!

07:26.160 --> 07:27.680
Olivia!

07:31.680 --> 07:32.960
Olivia!

07:34.680 --> 07:35.680
Olivia!

07:38.280 --> 07:39.400
Olivia!

07:39.440 --> 07:42.320
If you can hear me, just yell!

07:42.360 --> 07:43.520
Olivia!

07:44.480 --> 07:45.760
Olivia!

07:48.360 --> 07:49.840
If you can't yell,

07:49.880 --> 07:51.040
use your phone!

08:06.840 --> 08:08.680
At what time did you
report the incident?

08:08.720 --> 08:10.360
Uh, it was, uh-

08:10.400 --> 08:12.800
It was 8:15pm when you phoned it in,

08:12.840 --> 08:15.440
9pm by the time we arrived.

08:15.480 --> 08:18.480
With 45 minutes for you to dive in
to collect forensic evidence,

08:18.520 --> 08:21.000
while speaking directly to the
victim's family, before-

08:21.040 --> 08:24.680
I collected time-sensitive samples,
only once I knew it was a fatality.

08:24.720 --> 08:25.800
What citizen wouldn't?

08:25.840 --> 08:28.120
The rest of us, you mad fuck!

08:28.160 --> 08:30.880
You could've blown yourself to shit
when the vehicle went up.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.480
Hey. "If you can smell that,
blame a teacher."

08:35.520 --> 08:36.920
I'm still here.

08:39.440 --> 08:42.600
Olivia's parents are accusing you
of causing the explosion.

08:42.640 --> 08:44.320
That's just the grief speaking.

08:44.360 --> 08:45.840
C'mon, Betsy, what else was -

08:45.880 --> 08:47.480
how could I have done it
differently?

08:49.040 --> 08:51.960
Are we close to finding the
identity of the missing driver?

08:52.000 --> 08:55.720
OK. Yes. From the footprints
that Maggy found -

08:55.760 --> 08:59.880
We have size eight. New Balance 452.

08:59.920 --> 09:01.840
Well worn, the tread was quite bare

09:01.880 --> 09:03.560
which happen to match these

09:03.600 --> 09:06.720
from Olivia Turner's social media
postings last night.

09:06.760 --> 09:10.840
So just to confirm the two
girls Olivia Turner and Ella Squires

09:10.880 --> 09:14.040
one 17, the other nearly 18, but
y'know, both 17 for the record

09:14.080 --> 09:16.160
were together before the crash.

09:20.280 --> 09:23.520
Prints on the steering match Ella on
IDENT 1. Previous for shoplifting.

09:23.560 --> 09:25.920
We tracked her phone,
last location was the crash site.

09:25.960 --> 09:27.760
We scoured the crime scene
and no sign of it.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.400
Could be off. Or broke.

09:29.440 --> 09:31.520
She could have it with her,
but if it is,

09:31.560 --> 09:33.080
the battery's been removed,

09:33.120 --> 09:34.440
which wouldn't be an accident.

09:35.920 --> 09:38.760
Police have checked Ella's home and
college and are talking to friends.

09:38.800 --> 09:41.440
Parents aren't around.
She lives with her sister.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.400
Currently no sign of her.

09:43.440 --> 09:45.960
You wouldn't run if you weren't
guilty of something, would you?

09:46.000 --> 09:48.480
We don't jump to conclusions here.

09:48.520 --> 09:50.480
I'm just opening my mind
to all scenarios.

09:50.520 --> 09:51.760
Yeah,

09:51.800 --> 09:55.200
but there's a difference between
hypothesis and catastrophising.

09:55.240 --> 09:56.480
For the record.

10:06.680 --> 10:09.120
All I meant was, catastrophising can
split your focus

10:09.160 --> 10:11.280
when primary should be cold,
hard evidence.

10:13.000 --> 10:15.480
It's not off the cards,
but it's not for here.

10:15.520 --> 10:17.160
Well done team.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.160
(KNOCKS ON DOOR

10:29.960 --> 10:31.960
Cassie. Thanks for allowing us back.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.640
This is my colleague Wolfe.

10:33.680 --> 10:37.240
Tea, milk and I went for plain
biscuits instead of choccie.

10:37.280 --> 10:38.360
Less mess.

10:38.400 --> 10:42.400
There'll be quite a lot of intrusion
in your house over the next few days.

10:42.440 --> 10:43.800
You shouldn't be out of pocket.

10:52.720 --> 10:55.720
Whether you think you can or you
think you can't,

10:55.760 --> 10:57.240
you're right.

11:03.600 --> 11:05.400
That for me?

11:05.440 --> 11:07.400
Are you gonna be much longer?

11:07.440 --> 11:10.240
DCI Chambers run out of
asking the same questions?

11:10.280 --> 11:12.800
Hey, I wouldn't cross her
if she were my boss.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.440
Neither would I,
but I'm my own boss.

11:15.480 --> 11:17.680
Officer of the crown,
totally impartial.

11:17.720 --> 11:18.800
We're not police.

11:21.120 --> 11:23.040
Not as nice as Olivia's place.

11:23.080 --> 11:24.600
I haven't been.

11:24.640 --> 11:25.720
Why?

11:25.760 --> 11:27.080
Nobody's looking for Olivia.

11:30.240 --> 11:32.880
If you'd asked me two years
ago where she'd be.

11:32.920 --> 11:33.920
With who.

11:34.840 --> 11:36.160
I'd have a list,

11:37.520 --> 11:39.160
I coulda told you everything,

11:40.040 --> 11:42.120
'cos there wasn't, being honest

11:42.160 --> 11:44.120
that much to know.

11:44.160 --> 11:45.440
I wouldn't just have numbers,

11:46.560 --> 11:49.040
I'd have their parents' numbers.

11:49.080 --> 11:51.640
Now, I'm totally frozen out.
Hey, Cassie...

11:52.960 --> 11:55.600
It's hard enough being a parent
when you actually are one.

11:55.640 --> 11:57.840
How's anybody supposed
to keep 'em safe?

11:57.880 --> 12:00.000
You'da still been working all that
out for yourself

12:00.040 --> 12:01.160
when you had to take Ella on?

12:03.720 --> 12:05.680
Ella's a good driver.

12:05.720 --> 12:07.920
I've got a garage off the high
street,

12:07.960 --> 12:10.480
she'd been helping out for years.

12:10.520 --> 12:13.600
The only reason El would've
been driving Liv's car,

12:13.640 --> 12:16.080
is if Liv
was too pissed to drive herself.

12:17.840 --> 12:19.880
And if Liv was pissed,

12:19.920 --> 12:22.680
it's bang-on our Ella was too.

12:22.720 --> 12:24.040
'The cause of death is-'

12:24.080 --> 12:25.800
cranial blunt force injury.

12:25.840 --> 12:27.440
Was the airbag disabled?

12:27.480 --> 12:29.520
Neither Olivia or Ella had their
seatbelts on,

12:29.560 --> 12:30.800
so the airbags didn't go off.

12:30.840 --> 12:32.160
Ella got lucky.

12:32.200 --> 12:35.640
Even if she was wearing her belt or
had hit the bag,

12:35.680 --> 12:37.600
the branch ruptured
her abdominal aorta.

12:37.640 --> 12:39.120
She'd have bled-out, sharpish.

12:41.960 --> 12:45.320
If Maggy's scribbling everything
down, what's the point in a report?

12:45.360 --> 12:47.800
Your reports are great, Maxine,
we've no complaints.

12:47.840 --> 12:50.320
It's just, headlines would be
great for the time we've got.

12:50.360 --> 12:52.800
Except, personally, I love detail.

12:52.840 --> 12:55.080
I only include detail
that's applicable.

12:55.120 --> 12:56.120
Received.

12:56.160 --> 12:58.520
It's the 50 Shades of
Dead I could do without.

12:58.560 --> 12:59.760
I enjoy them.

12:59.800 --> 13:02.280
Brings a pizazz to a morbid read.

13:02.320 --> 13:03.720
Blood work's back.

13:03.760 --> 13:06.920
No traces of alcohol or drugs
in her system.

13:08.280 --> 13:09.480
Are you sure?

13:09.520 --> 13:12.800
No, I'm guessing wildly in
the hope of recognition.

13:12.840 --> 13:15.080
We bow to your diligence, Maxine.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.720
What time can we expect
the full report?

13:17.760 --> 13:19.280
You'll get it when I press send.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.000
Thanks Max,

13:21.040 --> 13:22.160
always a pleasure.

13:29.120 --> 13:31.000
The brake lines have
been tampered with.

13:33.240 --> 13:35.120
That's why there were no skid
marks on the road,

13:35.160 --> 13:38.160
not because Ella was too intoxicated
to break but because she couldn't.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.280
Let's look into everywhere
this car has been.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.000
Anyone that's come
into contact with it.

13:43.200 --> 13:45.200
We need to find Ella,

13:45.240 --> 13:47.240
guilty or not, she's scared.

13:48.920 --> 13:52.720
They leave college just before five
and head straight to the chippy.

13:52.760 --> 13:55.240
Traffic cameras see them heading
towards the Peak District

13:55.280 --> 13:58.760
but lose them at seven when they
head down lesser used country roads.

13:58.800 --> 14:02.000
Photos on Olivia’s phone put them
in the woods for a couple of hours

14:02.040 --> 14:04.560
There’s no-one else
in those pictures.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.760
No phone calls or messages are sent.

14:06.800 --> 14:10.320
And there’s nothing more
until the crash at nine.

14:10.360 --> 14:12.520
Having trouble locating this spot,

14:12.560 --> 14:15.160
the soil samples on the tyres are
all scorched.

14:15.200 --> 14:17.800
Check the shoes. I managed to pull
them off while I was in there.

14:17.840 --> 14:20.000
But if these girls have enemies,
I want to know who.

14:20.040 --> 14:24.560
Trawl their social media comments
for dodgy mates, pervy teachers.

14:24.600 --> 14:26.320
We need to find this cave.

14:35.200 --> 14:38.640
Who says that entomology isn't sexy?

14:38.680 --> 14:40.880
Most can't even spell it.

14:40.920 --> 14:43.440
Good job we got to you before
you were chargrilled.

14:44.920 --> 14:48.320
Steve, I get kids being
fascinated with bugs.

14:48.360 --> 14:49.520
What stuck?

14:52.240 --> 14:53.640
Yeah it's simple really.

14:53.680 --> 14:56.960
The soil on the shoes had traces
of the chestnut gall wasp.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.880
An hour of cross-referencing
Chestnut trees

14:58.920 --> 15:01.560
with a list of known caves
in the area and voila.

15:05.320 --> 15:07.560
Here you go.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.800
Break fluid.

15:11.840 --> 15:14.840
Secure the area.
Whoever cut the breaks,

15:14.880 --> 15:16.800
their DNA is here.

15:16.840 --> 15:17.960
Somewhere.

15:21.960 --> 15:23.000
Oh, Boss?

15:24.520 --> 15:25.720
Boss?

16:39.520 --> 16:41.800
Ambulance now.

16:41.840 --> 16:43.040
She's here!

16:43.080 --> 16:44.360
I need help.

17:05.960 --> 17:07.600
Stare much?

17:07.640 --> 17:08.760
Um.

17:08.800 --> 17:10.280
Yeah sorry, it's just,

17:10.320 --> 17:12.080
blood makes me feel a bit,

17:12.120 --> 17:14.160
you know.
Wrong job, mate.

17:15.240 --> 17:17.680
Yes, well not other people's,
obviously.

17:19.480 --> 17:21.160
Brave boy.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.040
You ready for this?

17:23.080 --> 17:24.800
Well that depends.
Are you gonna be gentle?

17:40.120 --> 17:41.520
- Ready?
Mm-hmm.

17:47.680 --> 17:48.680
Jesus.

17:49.920 --> 17:52.600
Ahh, look how good that looks.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.120
Wolfe's gonna be buzzing.

18:05.000 --> 18:06.200
No chance mate.

18:11.040 --> 18:12.400
I wouldn't.

18:13.720 --> 18:15.120
It would be, uh,

18:16.400 --> 18:18.080
proper unprofessional.

18:18.120 --> 18:20.720
That's which makes it... her...

18:20.760 --> 18:22.240
all the more alluring.

18:23.320 --> 18:26.160
It's nice to have a pretty face
to look at for a change.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.280
Oi.

18:27.320 --> 18:28.760
Oh, no you're beautiful.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.360
Just a bit too much dick for me.

18:32.400 --> 18:33.760
Ditto.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.120
This correlates
with Ella's injuries.

18:37.160 --> 18:39.080
But the other DNA
isn't a match for Liv.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.120
Station called - Ella's awake.

18:42.160 --> 18:44.280
Betsy said you can sit in
on the interview

18:44.320 --> 18:46.120
if you keep your trap shut.

18:46.160 --> 18:47.320
Great.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.040
I'll fetch the car.
Nope.

18:49.080 --> 18:50.640
You've offended
enough people today.

18:50.680 --> 18:52.320
Stay here and fix Ella's phone.

18:52.360 --> 18:53.920
Dominique, would you do the honours?

18:59.400 --> 19:01.040
She's only been awake a few hours.

19:01.080 --> 19:02.520
Keep this brief. Yeah?

19:05.120 --> 19:07.240
Was Olivia in pain?
Ella -

19:07.280 --> 19:10.320
Olivia died instantly. She wouldn't
have known what had happened.

19:10.360 --> 19:12.280
I'm really, really, sorry.
It was my fault.

19:12.320 --> 19:14.600
Don't say that.
Cross that out your notes.

19:14.640 --> 19:16.480
She takes it back.
She did nothing wrong.

19:16.520 --> 19:19.640
It's ok Cassie. Ella, your blood
work shows that you were sober.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.640
But I was driving. It was my fault.

19:21.680 --> 19:24.520
No. It was the fault of the person
who cut the breaks.

19:25.960 --> 19:27.160
I need some air.

19:29.120 --> 19:31.440
Who did you fight with
yesterday at the cave, Ella?

19:31.480 --> 19:33.520
Before the crash?
Nobody.

19:33.560 --> 19:35.560
Somebody tried to kill you.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.080
With your help and your honesty,

19:37.120 --> 19:40.800
DCI Chambers here can put this
person in prison for years.

19:40.840 --> 19:43.440
How long's the sentence, like,

19:43.480 --> 19:45.520
you know for... for what happened?

19:45.560 --> 19:47.760
Premeditated murder
carries a long term.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.640
Come on. Who gave you the makeover?

19:53.640 --> 19:55.520
Mackenzie Drayton.

19:55.560 --> 19:58.360
We go college together.

19:58.400 --> 20:00.720
Can you tell us how you got those
injuries, MacKenzie?

20:00.760 --> 20:01.760
Hold on. Hold on.

20:02.960 --> 20:05.600
No offence, but in this climate,

20:05.640 --> 20:08.640
can you say your names clearly
for the video?

20:08.680 --> 20:10.000
Am I a suspect?

20:10.040 --> 20:11.680
You're a person of interest.

20:12.640 --> 20:14.240
That's your loophole for harassment?

20:15.120 --> 20:18.800
We can do this at the station with a
lawyer present if you'd rather.

20:18.840 --> 20:21.800
Don't need to make such a
big deal about it.

20:21.840 --> 20:23.520
Ask your questions then.

20:23.560 --> 20:24.840
This was self-defence.

20:24.880 --> 20:26.600
Were you friends with
Ella and Olivia?

20:26.640 --> 20:30.120
With Liv. Before she became
'besties' with Ella.

20:30.160 --> 20:31.920
How did you feel about
their friendship?

20:32.800 --> 20:34.240
I don't like Ella.

20:34.280 --> 20:36.600
She's a yes person.
And yes people are fake.

20:36.640 --> 20:38.600
Or maybe she was lonely and
wanted to be affable.

20:39.760 --> 20:41.440
Dunno,

20:41.480 --> 20:42.840
don't care.

20:42.880 --> 20:45.000
She turned up and Liv wanted
nothing more to do with me

20:45.040 --> 20:46.800
and that felt like
a kick in the tits.

20:46.840 --> 20:49.360
So you were angry with Ella?

20:49.400 --> 20:51.840
I didn't get these bruises
by being affable.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.560
You know it's pretty screwed up that
Ella wants to press charges

20:55.600 --> 20:58.000
about our scrap when our
friend just died.

20:58.040 --> 21:01.080
She doesn't. These questions are in
relation to Olivia's death.

21:02.400 --> 21:03.520
But it was an accident.

21:03.560 --> 21:04.560
No.

21:04.600 --> 21:05.840
It wasn't.

21:05.880 --> 21:07.880
I think it's best to continue
this at the station.

21:07.920 --> 21:09.280
With a lawyer.

21:09.320 --> 21:10.760
I've not done anything wrong!

21:12.520 --> 21:13.640
Hello.

21:15.680 --> 21:16.920
Where are you?

21:30.040 --> 21:32.520
I'm sorry.
Her Mum wasn't answering and-

21:32.560 --> 21:33.840
Flick? Flick?

21:35.520 --> 21:37.720
Flick? Can you hear me?

21:37.760 --> 21:38.760
What's she taken?

21:38.800 --> 21:41.040
Prosecco and a few cigs.
It's no big deal.

21:47.040 --> 21:49.080
Hello daddy. D'you wanna blow-

21:57.560 --> 22:00.800
The carbon dioxide in bubbly will
just make the hangover worse.

22:00.840 --> 22:04.160
You're better off sticking to
spirits. Or a bottle of red.

22:06.640 --> 22:09.120
You gonna give me the
"special cuddle" talk next?

22:09.160 --> 22:12.960
Which type of lube has got the least
amount of toxic chemicals in?

22:13.000 --> 22:14.920
That's probably a conversation to
have with Mum.

22:14.960 --> 22:19.280
Or a verified NHS website.
This isn't a big deal.

22:19.320 --> 22:20.320
You were passed out.

22:20.360 --> 22:22.560
I was having a party nap and
a tactical puke-

22:22.600 --> 22:25.480
You're being reckless and
disobedient. And attention seeking.

22:25.520 --> 22:27.520
I guess I learnt that from you then.

22:29.480 --> 22:31.120
Anyway, all my mates drink.

22:31.160 --> 22:33.080
All your mates
started drinking years back.

22:33.120 --> 22:34.400
They've built tolerance.

22:34.440 --> 22:37.200
And it's not just about the
boozing. What's boxing all about?

22:37.240 --> 22:39.360
It's tantamount to self-harm,
and you're beautiful.

22:39.400 --> 22:41.520
I can't stomach watching.

22:41.560 --> 22:43.360
That's why you left?

22:43.400 --> 22:44.800
Figures.

22:44.840 --> 22:46.920
I thought chemo was the
worst part of Leukaemia.

22:46.960 --> 22:48.840
But your parents treating you
like a china doll

22:48.880 --> 22:50.840
for the rest of
your life just about trumps it.

22:54.320 --> 22:55.720
Dad,

22:55.760 --> 22:58.280
if you're gonna start crying
every time I talk about cancer

22:58.320 --> 23:00.360
we're gonna run out of
meaningful topics.

23:01.600 --> 23:03.600
I'm gonna get pissed.

23:03.640 --> 23:04.960
I'm gonna smoke weed.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.720
I'm gonna take E and
dance all night.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.720
I'm gonna do all of those things
'coz they're what

23:08.760 --> 23:11.240
I was dreaming of doing
when I was stuck in hospital

23:11.280 --> 23:13.880
having to read
Jacqueline fucking Wilson.

23:42.200 --> 23:44.280
You said you'd ring when
you were on your way.

23:45.680 --> 23:47.400
OK,

23:47.440 --> 23:50.120
we are gonna save all the
big words for tomorrow.

23:51.600 --> 23:53.520
I'm officially
your worst hangover.

23:53.560 --> 23:55.160
Upstairs.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.240
Shower.

23:57.400 --> 23:58.720
I'll bring water.

23:59.720 --> 24:02.880
Fair do's to Flick, she had tried
ringing but you weren't picking up.

24:02.920 --> 24:05.400
Well I'm sorry
you had to be the one, Wolfe,

24:05.440 --> 24:07.480
but thanks for being there.

24:07.520 --> 24:09.160
I'll make her grateful.

24:09.200 --> 24:12.760
I'm covered in bile and oestrogen.
May I...?

24:39.040 --> 24:40.240
Oh.

24:40.280 --> 24:41.720
Hiya, Wolfe.

24:41.760 --> 24:43.280
I, er...

24:43.320 --> 24:45.520
legacy of my Dad's as a tuner.

24:45.560 --> 24:48.680
I promised Val, seeing as it's a
present, I'd help her set it up.

24:48.720 --> 24:50.960
Not many tuners I know
can play like that.

24:52.040 --> 24:54.520
I did eight months at the
Royal Northern College of Music.

24:54.560 --> 24:57.120
They turfed you out with
talent like that?

24:57.160 --> 24:59.400
If only for the effort,
mate you were robbed.

24:59.440 --> 25:03.080
And can I please apologise
for telling you to fuck off?

25:03.120 --> 25:06.200
They turfed me out for starting a
copyright clearance agency

25:06.240 --> 25:07.400
on their time and property.

25:07.440 --> 25:09.480
It was never massive,

25:09.520 --> 25:11.120
but it's still running.
Mmm.

25:12.840 --> 25:14.880
Can I get you a drink?

25:14.920 --> 25:16.200
Just a small one?

25:18.320 --> 25:21.120
It's not one of Val's stash,
I brought it with me.

25:21.160 --> 25:22.560
I have to work.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.840
Thanks for bringing her home.

25:26.880 --> 25:28.920
Did you put her in the
recovery position?

25:28.960 --> 25:32.240
No, I strung her up by the feet
watching a stomach pump playlist.

25:32.280 --> 25:33.880
Actually, Jeff,

25:35.240 --> 25:39.560
now that it's up to scratch,
I wouldn't mind christening it.

25:39.600 --> 25:41.360
You don't play.

25:41.400 --> 25:44.200
Having time away from Val taught me

25:44.240 --> 25:47.640
Russian, or what I thought
was Russian, Mandarin,

25:47.680 --> 25:48.840
and keyboards.

25:50.240 --> 25:51.440
Hats off to you.

26:05.560 --> 26:07.320
Oh, woah, woah, woah -

26:07.360 --> 26:10.200
Fuck, sorry, sorry, man.

26:10.240 --> 26:12.840
Well, it's alright,

26:12.880 --> 26:14.840
it's not blood!

26:14.880 --> 26:17.240
And I'm way past the
driving limit anyway.

26:19.720 --> 26:20.800
Wolfe!

26:23.000 --> 26:26.760
We will be taking her phone
off her for a week.

26:26.800 --> 26:29.160
Something big,
but probably not that.

26:29.200 --> 26:30.680
She'd drive me up the wall.

26:31.720 --> 26:35.000
You need to see how old she got
behind our backs, Wolfe.

26:35.040 --> 26:37.840
She just made a point of making
me feel really lonely,

26:37.880 --> 26:39.760
which makes her sound about fifty,

26:39.800 --> 26:41.760
but I didn't have the guts
to crack that joke.

26:42.880 --> 26:44.560
You're frozen.

26:44.600 --> 26:46.600
Yeah, I'll get back in.
No, no, no.

26:47.960 --> 26:49.840
here!

26:49.880 --> 26:53.920
Since we're both agreed that neither
of us wants her turning into me.

26:53.960 --> 26:55.760
For God's sake,

26:55.800 --> 26:58.480
we're staring the answer in the face.
You invite me back...

26:58.520 --> 27:00.720
Wolfe, we are not...
No, you need to listen.

27:00.760 --> 27:02.400
We are not doing this.

27:09.120 --> 27:11.000
I need to get at my keys.

27:17.040 --> 27:18.840
If I move back in...

27:18.880 --> 27:21.320
No, you need to listen, we both do.

27:21.360 --> 27:24.200
I move back in, she has nowhere to
go with the attitude

27:24.240 --> 27:26.320
because I will totally upstage her.

27:26.360 --> 27:28.320
What if she upstages you,

27:28.360 --> 27:30.640
and I'm stuck between
two head the balls.

27:30.680 --> 27:32.840
Think again, Wolfe. A lot.

27:34.040 --> 27:35.080
Go home.

27:35.120 --> 27:39.040
Have you ever seen anybody shrink so
much when they take their shoes off?

27:39.080 --> 27:41.000
I mean, built up heels.

27:41.040 --> 27:42.120
Seriously?

27:50.120 --> 27:52.960
♪ Twinkle twinkle
little star ♪

28:42.960 --> 28:44.480
You haven't clocked off?

28:44.520 --> 28:47.920
I'm just retesting
some spatter methodology.

28:47.960 --> 28:50.880
While we love results,
they're less precious on fatigue.

28:57.240 --> 28:58.640
That was too close.

28:58.680 --> 28:59.880
You're telling me!

28:59.920 --> 29:01.000
Come on!

29:17.240 --> 29:18.600
We have to tell Wolfe.

29:19.680 --> 29:21.960
Seriously, Steve? At my expense?

29:22.960 --> 29:24.040
Yours?

29:26.720 --> 29:30.000
Look, I get that you and Dot and
Maggy have this

29:30.040 --> 29:32.920
co-dependent family vibe
cooking with Wolfe.

29:32.960 --> 29:34.800
It's cute.

29:34.840 --> 29:36.880
But I came in on
the back of you, Steve.

29:37.800 --> 29:39.560
What does that make us look like?

30:03.120 --> 30:05.160
'Professor Kinteh!'

30:05.200 --> 30:06.600
'There's a fire!'

30:10.520 --> 30:13.040
Why haven't the alarms gone off?
I can't smell anything?

30:16.200 --> 30:17.800
Why aren't you answering?

30:19.360 --> 30:21.000
My apologies, Mr Turner.

30:21.040 --> 30:24.280
Have you seen
what she looks like, now?

30:24.320 --> 30:25.360
No.

30:25.400 --> 30:27.560
Us neither. We're not allowed.

30:28.800 --> 30:33.320
Because you destroyed my evidence.

30:33.360 --> 30:34.800
You went down there,

30:34.840 --> 30:36.160
and fucked around with that car

30:36.200 --> 30:38.720
because you couldn't resist it,
didn't you?

30:38.760 --> 30:41.200
If you'd hadn't gone near,

30:41.240 --> 30:43.680
there might've been a shred...

30:45.680 --> 30:47.280
..of identification.

30:49.520 --> 30:53.240
No, no, "It's not really her
anymore, Mr Turner, not really."

30:53.280 --> 30:54.560
Joseph.

30:56.080 --> 31:00.160
I'm guessing you wouldn't have turned
up here today without a weapon, yeh?

31:03.120 --> 31:05.640
Save your strength. Let me help you.

31:20.400 --> 31:21.520
I, er,

31:22.600 --> 31:24.800
put the phone up to her mouth,

31:24.840 --> 31:26.680
for a count of 120.

31:29.840 --> 31:31.680
There was no respiration, Joseph.

31:46.120 --> 31:49.560
She suffered catastrophic
injuries on impact.

31:56.520 --> 31:59.360
After eighteen months, everything
just started going well.

32:01.240 --> 32:02.440
Better.

32:05.400 --> 32:08.280
What was the turbulence before that?

32:09.360 --> 32:11.120
She went down a hole.

32:11.160 --> 32:13.000
She was being treated for
depression.

32:14.120 --> 32:17.000
I'm not ashamed of going private.

32:17.040 --> 32:19.440
We'd nowhere else to turn.

32:19.480 --> 32:22.720
And it wasn't us forcing her
onto tablets and shit.

32:22.760 --> 32:24.320
She wanted help by then.

32:27.040 --> 32:29.160
Eventually,
eventually, it started working.

32:31.600 --> 32:33.320
Her lights came back on.

32:35.440 --> 32:36.640
Joseph,

32:36.680 --> 32:40.840
if Olivia was taking antidepressants
in the last three months,

32:42.680 --> 32:44.080
we'd have found out.

32:45.760 --> 32:46.960
We'd have known it.

32:48.680 --> 32:51.960
Her bloods were clean of
prescription meds.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.520
I'm so sorry.

33:09.200 --> 33:11.200
Off their meds,
off their heads, is it?

33:18.600 --> 33:19.920
You OK?
No.

33:22.880 --> 33:26.320
What if they'd meant to
go off that bridge.

33:26.360 --> 33:28.920
Olivia stopped taking her
anti-depressants

33:28.960 --> 33:31.840
and we can't link Mackenzie
to the car, not by a shred.

33:31.880 --> 33:34.920
But Ella, with her experience
working at her sister's garage,

33:34.960 --> 33:37.640
she'd have known exactly
how to mess with break lines.

33:37.680 --> 33:39.640
How long have you been
thinking like this?

33:45.640 --> 33:47.400
Olivia and Ella made a video.

33:48.480 --> 33:50.840
Wait, look at the next one first.

33:51.800 --> 33:53.520
(CRYING)'Cassie,

33:53.560 --> 33:55.200
it's still me.'

33:56.640 --> 33:58.760
'Liv's dead.'

33:58.800 --> 34:00.320
'She's dead!'

34:03.280 --> 34:05.680
'I'm really scared about
being here.'

34:11.520 --> 34:12.520
'Cassie, I...

34:14.520 --> 34:16.760
I don't want to be here!'

34:18.280 --> 34:20.440
Get Betsy to meet me at
the hospital.

34:49.320 --> 34:52.000
I hope you're enjoying the view
for the right reasons?

34:52.920 --> 34:56.160
I'd really love it if you'd just
shift it back a bit, Ella.

35:01.800 --> 35:02.920
OK.

35:04.080 --> 35:05.480
Here goes!

35:07.680 --> 35:08.840
Stay past that.

35:21.480 --> 35:24.360
Spent a lot of time on this roof.

35:24.400 --> 35:26.520
Never let my daughter this
close to the edge, though.

35:27.960 --> 35:29.080
Who was the patient?

35:30.320 --> 35:31.800
She was.

35:31.840 --> 35:33.600
Flick.

35:33.640 --> 35:35.040
For a long, long time.

35:36.040 --> 35:37.880
With leukaemia.

35:37.920 --> 35:39.160
What happened to her?

35:39.200 --> 35:41.880
She's fifteen now, thank God.

35:50.840 --> 35:53.200
I had a psychotic episode.

35:53.240 --> 35:54.720
Went doolally.

35:55.880 --> 36:00.200
Spent six months in a lock-up ward,
few more three month stints.

36:01.720 --> 36:03.240
You thought about suicide?

36:03.280 --> 36:04.800
Oh yeah.

36:06.160 --> 36:09.920
One time,"Get
him off the fucking subject,

36:09.960 --> 36:12.800
get him onto climate Change,
microbes,

36:12.840 --> 36:13.920
who cares!"

36:13.960 --> 36:15.920
(KNOCKING ON WINDOW

36:15.960 --> 36:18.480
No, no, fuck off.

36:18.520 --> 36:20.320
You're not sectioning me.

36:20.360 --> 36:22.720
Wait, wait, wait!
We've no intention!

36:22.760 --> 36:25.680
This is just banter
and anecdotes, folks.

36:26.640 --> 36:29.160
Give us a minute to get to the
punchlines, please?

36:41.920 --> 36:43.200
How um...

36:44.480 --> 36:47.720
..how long have you and Liv
been thinking about suicide?

36:49.400 --> 36:50.640
A while.

36:50.680 --> 36:53.200
Only decided to go through
with it yesterday?

36:53.240 --> 36:54.480
Because...?

36:56.920 --> 36:58.200
Because of Mackenzie?

36:58.240 --> 37:00.680
Liv wanted to tell Mackenzie but,

37:00.720 --> 37:02.280
she wouldn't get it.

37:03.840 --> 37:05.280
She'd say I was the bad influence.

37:05.320 --> 37:07.160
Even though it was Liv's idea.

37:09.480 --> 37:11.280
She was the one who told me
to cut the brakes.

37:12.280 --> 37:13.760
And what Liv wanted,

37:13.800 --> 37:15.960
was that important to you?

37:16.000 --> 37:18.520
The loneliness I felt,

37:18.560 --> 37:20.200
before I met her...

37:23.520 --> 37:26.000
..I never had to explain a
single thing to her.

37:27.240 --> 37:30.160
But suicide wasn't
one of your words back then?

37:32.280 --> 37:33.480
Trust me,

37:34.520 --> 37:36.560
it doesn't belong to you now, either.

37:37.960 --> 37:39.640
I read your postcard.

37:41.200 --> 37:44.120
"Whether you think can, or
you think you can't, you're right."

37:44.160 --> 37:46.280
Do you know whose quote that is?

37:46.320 --> 37:49.760
General Patton, second world war.

37:49.800 --> 37:52.160
He turned fear into determination.

37:52.200 --> 37:54.000
Saved a lot of lives.

37:56.680 --> 37:59.400
Actually, it was Henry Ford.

38:00.920 --> 38:01.920
What, really?

38:04.640 --> 38:07.000
I've repeated that in
about a dozen lectures!

38:09.320 --> 38:11.080
However,

38:11.120 --> 38:12.560
it's the same sentiment.

38:15.800 --> 38:17.440
Olivia,

38:17.480 --> 38:19.760
stopped taking
her medication suddenly,

38:19.800 --> 38:22.240
which can be a fast track
to suicidal thoughts.

38:23.160 --> 38:25.040
Just because she took you there,

38:25.080 --> 38:27.000
doesn't mean it's where you belong.

38:28.800 --> 38:31.360
Milk being adolescent.

38:31.400 --> 38:33.480
Get access to treatment.

38:33.520 --> 38:35.080
I can recommend the best.

38:57.360 --> 38:59.040
Flick's pissed off with me.

38:59.080 --> 39:00.280
So is Valerie.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.560
That's why I've been a bit...

39:05.360 --> 39:08.080
Don't blame your own behaviour
on anyone but yourself.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.120
Thanks Betsy, I'm,

39:12.160 --> 39:13.920
doing my best.

39:13.960 --> 39:15.000
No!

39:16.320 --> 39:18.960
You actually didn't listen to
that sentence, did you?

39:22.160 --> 39:23.920
I'm looking for a pep talk here.

39:26.880 --> 39:28.080
You want a distraction

39:28.120 --> 39:30.560
from going round with your tail
between your legs

39:30.600 --> 39:34.080
and apologising for whatever
idiotic thing you've done

39:34.120 --> 39:35.280
or said now.

39:39.080 --> 39:40.320
I just,

39:40.360 --> 39:42.160
miss them so much.

39:46.040 --> 39:47.040
I know.

39:51.520 --> 39:52.840
But they're not going anywhere.

39:53.960 --> 39:56.040
Unless you keep pushing them away.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.080
Fuck cancer! And divorce!

40:07.120 --> 40:10.520
And having a daughter who
is smarter than you.

40:13.360 --> 40:16.520
Fuck my crazy,
overbearing, complicated,

40:16.560 --> 40:19.640
understanding, forgiving, parents!

40:24.640 --> 40:25.960
Um,

40:26.000 --> 40:28.040
I'm going to delegate to
Maggy a bit more.

40:28.080 --> 40:29.640
So we can have more
Dad-Daughter time.

40:29.680 --> 40:31.680
Don't call it that it sounds creepy.

40:33.240 --> 40:35.560
And I'm going to be
less of a nuisance to Mum.

40:35.600 --> 40:37.760
Even though she secretly likes it.

40:37.800 --> 40:39.160
She doesn't.

40:40.840 --> 40:44.240
I'm sorry me getting ill meant
you and Mum stopped working.

40:44.280 --> 40:46.040
It's not your fault.

40:47.480 --> 40:50.000
You can talk to me. Ok?
About anything.

40:50.040 --> 40:53.120
Boys, booze, drugs,

40:53.160 --> 40:55.920
body dysmorphia, Cardi B...

40:55.960 --> 40:57.480
and I promise,

40:57.520 --> 40:58.840
I won't judge, I'll listen.

40:58.880 --> 41:01.280
I never want you to feel like you
have to lie to me Flick.

41:02.800 --> 41:05.320
This is gross. You're all sweaty.

41:06.960 --> 41:08.880
I gotta bounce, Mum's picking me up.

41:10.160 --> 41:11.720
Seeing JJ tonight?

41:11.760 --> 41:13.880
He's playing five-a-side.

41:13.920 --> 41:15.120
He's got that many friends?

41:15.160 --> 41:17.440
Dad, for my sake,
don't ruin this for Mum.

41:17.480 --> 41:20.000
When she likes him and he makes
her laugh, she's not the opposite.

41:20.040 --> 41:22.080
Which seriously helps me out.

41:22.120 --> 41:23.640
Do you understand?

41:23.680 --> 41:25.200
Thanks for the punchball.

41:25.240 --> 41:27.360
That was so instinctive of you.

41:48.240 --> 41:50.520
OK, tongue up for me. Next!

42:12.200 --> 42:13.600
What's changed?

42:14.760 --> 42:17.040
You look beautiful!

42:17.080 --> 42:18.400
You too.

42:21.160 --> 42:23.920
It's been a while since
you lied Dominique.

42:25.280 --> 42:27.200
Sorry!

42:30.360 --> 42:32.160
I've got a new job.

42:32.200 --> 42:33.680
it's kept me pretty busy.

42:34.680 --> 42:36.600
You know, in the lab in Manchester.

42:38.240 --> 42:40.840
Actually, this job -
I don't know why you'd go back.

42:40.880 --> 42:42.760
You know, after-
Yeah.

42:47.200 --> 42:49.360
I was thinking about
visiting the flat.

42:49.400 --> 42:50.480
Don't do that.

42:52.080 --> 42:54.760
I need to go and pay my respects.

42:58.200 --> 42:59.800
It won't bring him back.

43:04.800 --> 43:07.320
I didn't mean to upset you, Mum.

43:13.640 --> 43:16.880
Promise me you won't be
relying on the past,

43:16.920 --> 43:18.600
cos there's nothing to have.

44:03.360 --> 44:05.800
Let's put you somewhere
nice and warm, huh?

44:18.800 --> 44:20.720
Twinkle Twinkle.
