what I've always wanted.

00:07.137 --> 00:08.617
Just wish I knew that
Pierce's intentions were pure.

00:08.660 --> 00:10.010
If you want to take it slow,
that's okay,

00:10.053 --> 00:12.055
but from where I stand,
I'm all in.

00:12.099 --> 00:13.752
I told you not to
talk to Charlotte.

00:13.796 --> 00:15.406
She's a human woman

who isn't ready to hear
what you have to say.

00:17.104 --> 00:19.236

And that's insane.

Charlotte,
do you have a minute?

At this point,

I am done with Earth

You're afraid
of your daddy?

You are gonna regret this.

Good morning,

Hey.

Have you seen
the evidence closet?

Uh... no.

01:35.051 --> 01:36.574
Wow.

01:36.618 --> 01:39.229
This is a great closet.

isn't it?

01:59.989 --> 02:01.338
Speaking of,
you'll never guess

02:01.382 --> 02:02.774
what happened to me
last night, Detective.

02:02.818 --> 02:05.212
What's that?[sighs]

02:05.255 --> 02:06.474
I woke up alone.

02:06.517 --> 02:08.519
And?
[sighs]
It's funny because

02:08.563 --> 02:09.912
I usually don't,
because I usually

02:09.955 --> 02:12.523
have women over,
or men, or both for sex.

02:12.567 --> 02:14.134

Okay.

02:14.177 --> 02:16.048

Will he be

02:16.092 --> 02:17.180
coming with you from now on?

02:17.224 --> 02:18.703
Because he is killing
our banter.

02:18.747 --> 02:19.704
Absolutely not, no.

02:19.748 --> 02:22.185
Pierce and I only came--

02:22.229 --> 02:24.361
drove together just
this one time.

One time.
[clears throat]

the victim's from
a well-connected family.

to keep them in the loop.

I won't interfere

02:34.110 --> 02:36.721
or the, uh, dream team.Uh-uh.

02:36.765 --> 02:39.376
Now, if you'll
excuse me.

02:39.420 --> 02:42.510
Okay. Shall we?
[clears throat]

02:42.553 --> 02:45.077
Uh... you have DNA
on your shirt.

02:45.121 --> 02:46.601

03:11.278 --> 03:12.801
Right.

03:22.637 --> 03:24.508
Oh. So, what's he doing
getting killed

03:24.552 --> 03:25.988
in such a crappy neighborhood?

03:26.031 --> 03:27.990
Apparently, he rented
a room here.

03:28.033 --> 03:30.601
Not sure why he would,
but Kevin

03:30.645 --> 03:33.996
was notoriously the black
sheep of the Winstead clan.

03:34.039 --> 03:35.824
Heroin addiction.

03:35.867 --> 03:38.087
Although...

03:38.130 --> 03:40.045
from the looks
of these healed track marks,

03:40.089 --> 03:42.570
it appears that Kevin
might have gone clean recently.

03:42.613 --> 03:44.136
Not an easy thing to do.

03:44.180 --> 03:45.921
And, apparently,
a waste of his time.

03:45.964 --> 03:46.965
What was the cause of death?

03:47.009 --> 03:49.403
Gunshot wound to the chest.

03:49.446 --> 03:50.839
Shot during a home
invasion robbery?Maybe.

03:50.882 --> 03:53.145
But the killer never got
around to taking anything.

03:53.189 --> 03:54.973
Got interrupted by
the house's owner.

03:55.017 --> 03:57.498

Oh, that poor boy.

03:57.541 --> 03:59.195
He seemed nice.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.197
Why don't you tell me
what happened.I was sleeping,

04:01.241 --> 04:03.330
and I heard glass breaking,

04:03.373 --> 04:05.854
so I went down
to check it out.

04:05.897 --> 04:07.551
And then I heard arguing.

04:07.595 --> 04:09.640
Uh, what were they
arguing about?

04:09.684 --> 04:12.295
The voices were muffled,
but I did hear someone say,

04:12.339 --> 04:13.862
"Kevin, stop."

04:13.905 --> 04:15.820
So, the intruder
knew the victim.

04:15.864 --> 04:18.170
The former heroin addict
had nefarious friends.

04:18.214 --> 04:20.172
Shocking.Did you get

04:20.216 --> 04:21.957
a good look at the guy?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.306
He was wearing a mask.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.308
I would be dead for sure

04:25.352 --> 04:28.050
if God hadn't sent
that angel to protect me.

04:28.093 --> 04:29.225
CHLOE:
So, there was someone else

04:29.269 --> 04:30.531
in the house.

04:30.574 --> 04:33.185
Not another person.
An angel, who saved me.

04:33.229 --> 04:34.665
It-it flew in here,

04:34.709 --> 04:36.493
and it just chased
the evil man away.

04:36.537 --> 04:37.799
[Lucifer laughs]

04:37.842 --> 04:39.670
I'm sorry, sorry,
it's just the only thing

04:39.714 --> 04:42.238
my siblings would chase away
are a good time.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.066
I have proof.

04:44.109 --> 04:46.851
The angel...

04:46.895 --> 04:48.853
he took one
of my figurines.

04:48.897 --> 04:51.334
Hmm? Gabriel.

04:51.378 --> 04:53.554
Right.

04:53.597 --> 04:54.859
Try lending him
some money.

04:54.903 --> 04:56.600
Your tune changes
rather quickly.

04:56.644 --> 04:57.819
Mrs. Hernandez,
why don't we get you

04:57.862 --> 04:59.081
checked out
at the hospital?

05:00.430 --> 05:02.432
Thank you.
Yes.

05:02.476 --> 05:04.347
All right, let's do
a background check on Kevin.

05:04.391 --> 05:06.044
Let's see if he had issues
with anybody.

05:06.088 --> 05:07.785
Keep an eye out
for this angelic witness.

05:07.829 --> 05:09.700
Hey, maybe it was
one of your brothers.

05:09.744 --> 05:12.660
[chuckles, sighs]

05:12.703 --> 05:15.227
Seriously, is it
one of your brothers?

05:15.271 --> 05:16.707
Preposterous.

05:16.751 --> 05:18.492
My Father doesn't
send my siblings down

05:18.535 --> 05:20.755
to intervene in petty
robberies in Pacoima.[phone ringing]

05:20.798 --> 05:23.235
He only sends them
to harass me.

05:23.279 --> 05:26.848
Oh, and speaking of...

05:26.891 --> 05:28.284
Hello?

05:32.941 --> 05:34.246
Right, I'm here.

05:34.290 --> 05:35.465
What's so dastardly
important?

05:35.509 --> 05:37.249
Okay, Luci, I think
we made a mistake

05:37.293 --> 05:40.035
revealing divinity
to Charlotte Richards.

05:40.078 --> 05:42.254
[laughs]
We? It was your idea.

05:42.298 --> 05:43.560
But now I'm having
second thoughts.

05:43.604 --> 05:45.780
What if she
tells someone?

05:45.823 --> 05:48.348
Oh, no, you're right.

05:48.391 --> 05:50.088
'Cause then that person
might tell someone else,

05:50.132 --> 05:51.742
who then might tell someone
else, which could lead to

05:51.786 --> 05:54.963
absolutely nothing happening
'cause no one will believe her.

05:55.006 --> 05:56.921
Okay, look, you
might not care, Luci,

05:56.965 --> 05:59.315
but the concept of divinity
is too big

05:59.359 --> 06:00.751
for humans to handle.

06:00.795 --> 06:02.753
We don't know what she's
gonna do now that she knows.

06:02.797 --> 06:04.407
And I don't care.

06:04.451 --> 06:05.669
You're right.

06:05.713 --> 06:07.454
Oh, question, brother.

06:07.497 --> 06:09.630
You don't happen to know
if any of our siblings

06:09.673 --> 06:10.805
might be in town?

06:10.848 --> 06:12.415
Not that I'm aware of.

06:12.459 --> 06:13.590
Ah.

06:13.634 --> 06:14.939
Why?

06:14.983 --> 06:16.158
Oh, it's probably nothing.

06:16.201 --> 06:17.594
Just an old woman

06:17.638 --> 06:19.901
in some unremarkable home
said an angel

06:19.944 --> 06:21.119
broke into her house.

06:21.163 --> 06:22.947
Saved her life.

06:22.991 --> 06:25.341
Stole one of her
hideous figurines.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.256
All that trouble for
one ordinary human?

06:27.299 --> 06:28.649
[chuckles]:
Yeah.

06:28.692 --> 06:30.651
I mean, it would have to be
one very bored

Yea--

06:42.227 --> 06:44.229
♪

06:51.672 --> 06:53.630
I mean, there must be some sort
of reasonable explanation.

06:53.674 --> 06:55.197
And you don't remember
how the figurine

06:55.240 --> 06:56.590
got into your bedroom?
No.

06:56.633 --> 06:58.635
I mean, maybe it's
a housewarming gift or...

06:58.679 --> 07:00.855
or a sex toy.

07:00.898 --> 07:02.204
Or a housewarming gift
sex toy.

07:02.247 --> 07:03.814
I just...
[laughs]

07:03.858 --> 07:05.033
And it's identical
to the one missing

07:05.076 --> 07:06.208
from that woman's house?Yes.

07:06.251 --> 07:09.646
But it's coincidence, surely.

07:09.690 --> 07:13.041
You've been complaining about
having weird dreams lately.

07:13.084 --> 07:15.826
Including one where you
couldn't control your wings.

07:15.870 --> 07:18.568
I've also dreamt I was
king of the centaur people.

07:18.612 --> 07:21.136
Doesn't mean I'm gonna
start wearing horseshoes.

07:21.179 --> 07:23.268
There have been instances
where people sleepwalk

07:23.312 --> 07:25.575
when they're having difficulty
dealing with painful situations.

07:25.619 --> 07:28.709
Or, inversely,
not dealing with them.

07:28.752 --> 07:31.015
Is it possible you're
not dealing with something,

07:31.059 --> 07:33.888
and, thus, sleepflying?

07:33.931 --> 07:35.237
That's absurd. I mean,
what in the world

07:35.280 --> 07:37.848
could I not be dealing with?I don't know.

07:37.892 --> 07:40.721
Chloe and Pierce, maybe?
Perhaps you're not as

07:40.764 --> 07:43.245
okay with that relationship
as you think.

07:43.288 --> 07:45.377
Look, I am not an idiot, Doctor.

07:45.421 --> 07:48.380
Clearly, I don't
love them together,

with Adele on repeat.

07:53.734 --> 07:56.214
And I'm definitely
not this angel.

07:56.258 --> 07:59.696
And, I know just
how to prove it.

08:02.569 --> 08:03.874
PIERCE:
This was nice.

08:03.918 --> 08:07.399
This was...

08:07.443 --> 08:09.401
Crap.

08:09.445 --> 08:10.664
Wow, not even remotely close

08:10.707 --> 08:12.056
to what I thought
you were gonna say.

08:12.100 --> 08:14.363
No, no, the time.
We got to go.

08:14.406 --> 08:15.538
What? Why?

08:15.582 --> 08:16.887
Trixie's gonna be home
any minute.

08:16.931 --> 08:19.237
And you don't want her
to see me here.

08:19.281 --> 08:20.674
Look, you're pretty much
the first person

08:20.717 --> 08:22.066

08:22.110 --> 08:24.721
I haven't introduced Trixie
to anybody.

08:24.765 --> 08:28.899
And I just don't want
to do that until I'm sure.

08:28.943 --> 08:30.466
And it's not that
I'm not sure.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.425
I just, I-I want to be ready,
and I want to know. You know?

08:33.469 --> 08:34.470
Maybe I shouldn't
have said all that.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.385
Anyhow...What's the prob...

08:38.909 --> 08:42.130
Listen, fast or slow,
whatever the speed,

08:42.173 --> 08:43.479
I'm into this.

08:43.523 --> 08:44.785
If you haven't
figured it out, Chloe,

08:44.828 --> 08:46.787
I'm in...

08:46.830 --> 08:49.137
I like you.

[clears throat]Oh, it's Lucifer.

08:57.624 --> 09:00.540
Of course it is.

Good, you're here.

We need to find the killer.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.244
Is this that super
important thing

09:09.287 --> 09:11.115
you said you needed
to talk to me about?

09:11.159 --> 09:14.031
Yes, because this case is of the
utmost importance to me now.

09:14.075 --> 09:16.599
Really? Why?
Because if,

09:16.643 --> 09:18.514
in the miniscule realm
of possibility,

09:18.558 --> 09:20.777
that crazy old lady did,
in fact, see an angel,

09:20.821 --> 09:23.127
I need to prove that
the angel wasn't me.

09:23.171 --> 09:25.347
I think I can help with that.
It wasn't you.

09:25.390 --> 09:26.653
Well, I'm sure
you're probably right.

09:26.696 --> 09:28.132
And when the killer
confirms as such,

09:28.176 --> 09:29.264
I'll be one happy Devil.

09:29.307 --> 09:30.613
So, come on, chop-chop.
What do we got?

09:30.657 --> 09:31.788
[sighs]

09:31.832 --> 09:34.312
Okay, two days ago,
Kevin checked out

09:34.356 --> 09:36.967
of a high-end rehab
facility-- Sunrise Sands.

09:37.011 --> 09:38.490
And according to this
incident report,

09:38.534 --> 09:40.623
he got into a pretty nasty fight
with a fellow resident

09:40.667 --> 09:43.626
right before he left--
a guy named Phil Goldstein.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.323
Yeah, come on.
I'm driving.

09:45.367 --> 09:46.977
♪ I know you've been waiting

09:47.021 --> 09:48.805
♪ You've been waiting
all your life ♪

09:48.849 --> 09:49.806
♪ I know what you're thinking

09:49.850 --> 09:51.634
♪ I can see it in your eyes

09:51.678 --> 09:55.116
LUCIFER: I don't understand
why humans waste so much time

09:55.159 --> 09:56.683
resisting their desires.

09:56.726 --> 09:58.815
A rehabilitation center
for drugs and sex. [laughs]

09:58.859 --> 10:00.600
CHLOE:
Mr. Goldstein?

10:00.643 --> 10:01.862
[moans softly]Detective Chloe Decker,

10:01.905 --> 10:04.386
LAPD. We'd like to ask
you a few questions

10:04.429 --> 10:05.561
about Kevin Winstead.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.129
The answer's yes...
he's a douchebag.

10:08.172 --> 10:10.000
Did you know that
he was murdered?

10:10.044 --> 10:14.222
No, but it's nice to get
good news for a change.

10:15.702 --> 10:16.920
The admin office said
that you were gone

10:16.964 --> 10:18.400
for a few hours
last night

10:18.443 --> 10:20.315
during the time
of Kevin's murder.

10:20.358 --> 10:22.317
So, would you like to
tell us where you were?

10:22.360 --> 10:25.363
I went for a drive.
We're not prisoners here.

10:25.407 --> 10:26.800
Can anyone confirm that?

10:26.843 --> 10:30.760
If producing nine legal shows
taught me anything,

10:30.804 --> 10:34.372
it's that I don't have to
say jack without a lawyer.

10:34.416 --> 10:38.289
If you'll excuse me
while I go take a crap.

10:39.726 --> 10:40.683
What are you doing?Actually,

10:40.727 --> 10:42.380
Phil, I've had enough
of your crap!

10:42.424 --> 10:44.556
Now, I know that you
killed Kevin Winstead,

10:44.600 --> 10:46.384
and then an angel interrupted
your escape.

10:46.428 --> 10:47.690
So, tell me,
what did he look like?

10:47.734 --> 10:48.822
Lucifer.Man, what the hell

10:48.865 --> 10:49.866
are you talking about, man?

10:49.910 --> 10:52.347
Did he look like me?!

10:52.390 --> 10:53.522
Lucifer, stop.

10:53.565 --> 10:54.741
I did not kill Kevin.

10:54.784 --> 10:56.003
[panting]

10:56.917 --> 10:59.049
But you guys
did fight, right?

10:59.093 --> 11:02.574
That is only 'cause Kevin took
this rehab stuff so seriously.

11:02.618 --> 11:04.620
The rest of us?
It's a smoke screen.

11:04.664 --> 11:06.274
Keep our wives and jobs at bay.

11:06.317 --> 11:08.580
But Kevin wouldn't
shut up about

11:08.624 --> 11:11.801
getting clean,
getting his family back.

11:11.845 --> 11:13.150
He drove me nuts.

11:13.194 --> 11:14.586
So I punched him.

11:14.630 --> 11:15.979
Get his family back?

11:16.023 --> 11:17.938
I... His parents are dead,
and he wasn't married.

11:17.981 --> 11:19.896
I don't know about any of that.

11:19.940 --> 11:21.289
Where were you last night?

11:21.332 --> 11:22.290
Answer her.

11:22.333 --> 11:23.378
Uh, uh...

11:23.421 --> 11:24.466
Uh, with hookers.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.557
That's why I'm in here.

11:28.600 --> 11:29.732
I'm a sex addict.

11:29.776 --> 11:30.864
[chuckles]

11:30.907 --> 11:32.430
CHLOE: Ah.It's court-ordered.

11:32.474 --> 11:33.910
Anyway, you know,

11:33.954 --> 11:35.912
two steps forward,

11:35.956 --> 11:38.915
one step back, right?

11:41.483 --> 11:42.789
Hey, what was that about?

11:42.832 --> 11:44.616
It's nothing.

11:44.660 --> 11:45.748
That was not nothing.

11:45.792 --> 11:46.967
Talk to me.

11:47.010 --> 11:48.751
Look, I just haven't
been sleeping well.

11:48.795 --> 11:50.666
That's all-- but never mind
that, what's next?

11:50.710 --> 11:52.842
What's next is you
take the afternoon off.

11:52.886 --> 11:54.104
Get some rest.

11:54.148 --> 11:55.758
What? I'd rather go
and find the killer.

11:55.802 --> 11:57.194
It's not a suggestion,
Lucifer.

11:57.238 --> 11:59.066
Look, I'm gonna spend
the rest of the day

11:59.109 --> 12:00.676
poring through Kevin's file,

12:00.720 --> 12:02.199
trying to figure out
who his family is.

12:02.243 --> 12:04.114
We probably won't know anything
until tomorrow morning.

12:04.158 --> 12:05.246
Tomorrow?

12:05.289 --> 12:07.204
Go home. You're tired.

12:07.248 --> 12:11.643
Okay. Fine. But,
only if I can borrow these.

12:12.862 --> 12:14.124
Well, I promise
I'll bring them back.

12:14.168 --> 12:15.778
Please don't.

12:15.822 --> 12:17.301
Ew.

12:18.955 --> 12:21.349
[grunting]

12:21.392 --> 12:23.394
[exhales]

12:33.274 --> 12:35.276

12:44.546 --> 12:45.982

Luci.

12:46.026 --> 12:47.157
Lucifer.

12:47.201 --> 12:48.202
[grunts]

12:48.245 --> 12:49.943
Wake up.
[groans]

12:49.986 --> 12:51.292
Ugh.

12:51.335 --> 12:52.815
No offense, brother,
but on the list of things

12:52.859 --> 12:54.991
I'd like to wake up to,
your face falls somewhere

12:55.035 --> 12:58.690
after a horse's head
and Coldplay tickets.

12:58.734 --> 13:00.518
I just came to show you this.

13:01.563 --> 13:03.347
What...?

13:05.219 --> 13:07.395
"The Angel of San Bernardino"?

13:09.049 --> 13:10.528
See, I thought that maybe
one of our siblings

13:10.572 --> 13:11.616
wasin town.

13:11.660 --> 13:13.009
But, Luci,

13:13.053 --> 13:14.402
it appears that, uh...

13:14.445 --> 13:16.056
I am the angel.

13:20.625 --> 13:22.105
"Witnesses say
the unknown Samaritan

13:22.149 --> 13:24.020
"appeared to have wings.

13:24.064 --> 13:26.022
Sort of flew in like..."
This is ludicrous.

13:26.066 --> 13:27.545
It-it can't be me.

13:27.589 --> 13:28.677
Can it?

13:28.720 --> 13:29.721
Luci.

13:29.765 --> 13:31.027
Just look around.

13:31.071 --> 13:32.594
Look at your hands.

13:32.637 --> 13:34.901
I think it is you,
and I think it's all my fault.

13:34.944 --> 13:37.077
In what possible way
is this your fault?

13:37.120 --> 13:39.079
Because I made you show
your wings to Charlotte.

13:39.122 --> 13:40.341
Reveal divinity.

13:40.384 --> 13:41.908
And now, Father
is punishing us for it.

13:41.951 --> 13:43.953
Look, Father making
me do angelic deeds

13:43.997 --> 13:46.086
is a divine kick
in the nuts to me.

13:46.129 --> 13:48.175
Well, my punishment
must be forthcoming.

13:48.218 --> 13:49.263
What?And who knows

13:49.306 --> 13:50.786
in what form it will come.

13:50.830 --> 13:53.049
Don't be ridiculous.
You or I aren't being punished

13:53.093 --> 13:55.660
for Charlotte Richards,
same as I wasn't punished

13:55.704 --> 13:57.097
for revealing myself to Linda.

13:57.140 --> 13:58.925
Okay, well, then,
how do you explain all of this?

13:58.968 --> 14:00.274
Well, it's obvious, isn't it?

14:00.317 --> 14:02.406
It's just more manipulation.

14:02.450 --> 14:04.408
Quite possibly, Dad's master
plan all along. I mean,

14:04.452 --> 14:07.063
first, he makes me look
the part of an angel.

14:07.107 --> 14:09.544
And then, he forces me
to act it in my sleep.

14:09.587 --> 14:11.241
I don't know, Luci.

14:11.285 --> 14:13.026
Well, if working
with the detective

14:13.069 --> 14:15.245
has taught me anything,
it's that I need proof.

14:15.289 --> 14:17.813
Only the killer can say
for certain if it was me.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.119
So I'm off to work.

14:22.122 --> 14:24.298
Might have a shower
and stuff first, huh?Yeah.

14:24.341 --> 14:27.910
I'll get some takeout, because
being with you is the dessert.

14:27.954 --> 14:29.259
It's a date.

14:29.303 --> 14:30.565
Can't wait to
see you later.

14:30.608 --> 14:33.307
#Dyingofcuteness.

14:33.350 --> 14:35.135
How long have you been there?

14:35.178 --> 14:37.746
Long enough to hear
how totally adorbs that was.

14:37.789 --> 14:39.922
Sounds like things
are going really well.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.489
They are. But...

14:41.532 --> 14:42.794
But...

14:42.838 --> 14:44.100
There's a "but" in there.

14:44.144 --> 14:45.928
I think she's holding back.

14:45.972 --> 14:48.452
She hasn't said the magic words.

14:48.496 --> 14:49.453
What magic words?

14:49.497 --> 14:50.933
You know.

14:50.977 --> 14:52.674
Those three little words.

14:53.805 --> 14:56.417
Rhymes with "my guv boo."

14:56.460 --> 14:58.462
She hasn't said them, yeah.

14:58.506 --> 15:00.464
You and I,
we're the same.

15:00.508 --> 15:03.467
The rock that people break
themselves against,

15:03.511 --> 15:06.949
and you know what happens
to rocks like us?

15:06.993 --> 15:10.518
When we fall, ooh,
we fall really hard.

15:10.561 --> 15:12.650
Kind of
a scary place, huh?

15:12.694 --> 15:14.609
But don't worry, LT.

15:14.652 --> 15:17.133
When the time is right,
she'll say them.

15:17.177 --> 15:18.787
And, when she finally does...

15:18.830 --> 15:19.875
[imitates explosion]

15:19.919 --> 15:22.486
Everything will change.

15:22.530 --> 15:24.706
I'm counting on it.

15:24.749 --> 15:27.665
Hmm.

15:27.709 --> 15:30.538
Your casserole tastes
like roadkill.

15:30.581 --> 15:31.713
[groans]

15:31.756 --> 15:32.888
Oh, and you.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.021
Stop telling stories
about your children,

15:35.064 --> 15:37.023
'cause no one cares.

15:37.066 --> 15:38.328
[scoffs]

15:38.372 --> 15:40.635
Hmm, Sally.

15:40.678 --> 15:41.853
Oh, Charlotte.

15:41.897 --> 15:43.464
It's not the clothes
that make you look fat.

15:43.507 --> 15:44.682
It's the fat.

15:44.726 --> 15:45.857
Ugh.
Yeah.

15:45.901 --> 15:47.555
Oof. And you.

15:48.904 --> 15:50.645
[clears throat]

15:50.688 --> 15:52.864
You are pretty great, actually.

15:52.908 --> 15:55.563
Uh, thanks?

15:56.607 --> 15:59.045
And you.

15:59.088 --> 16:02.004
You are coming with me.

16:02.048 --> 16:03.179
Okay.

16:06.095 --> 16:09.185
CHLOE: Mrs. Bell,
this is a copy

16:09.229 --> 16:10.665
of your son's birth certificate.

16:10.708 --> 16:12.884
It says that Kevin Winstead
is the father.

16:12.928 --> 16:14.930
Kevin and I dated years ago.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.236
We were going
to get married

16:16.279 --> 16:18.716
after I got pregnant
with Jackson.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.675
But I called it off
at the last minute.

16:20.718 --> 16:21.763
[Jackson screams]

16:21.806 --> 16:24.418
NANNY:
Jackson, stop.Oh, no, no, no!

16:24.461 --> 16:25.897
No, no.
JACKSON:
No, no, no!

16:25.941 --> 16:27.377
NANNY: Get off
the floor.
I got it.

16:27.421 --> 16:29.597
Yeah, and people choose
to procreate.

16:29.640 --> 16:31.381
I'm afraid my son
has Kevin's temper.

16:31.425 --> 16:32.426
But you are

16:32.469 --> 16:34.906
the one with
the assault charges.

16:34.950 --> 16:36.821
I did my share
of drugs with Kevin.

16:36.865 --> 16:38.258
I'm not proud of
who I was then.

16:38.301 --> 16:39.389
LUCIFER:
Right.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.217
The drugs made you wild.

16:41.261 --> 16:44.046
Which is why I stopped using.

16:44.090 --> 16:47.049
But Kevin liked getting high
more than he loved me.

16:47.093 --> 16:49.747
Our relationship
became toxic.

16:49.791 --> 16:50.922
So I left.

16:50.966 --> 16:52.402
CHLOE:
And when was the last time

16:52.446 --> 16:53.795
you spoke to Kevin?It's been years.

16:53.838 --> 16:56.058
'Cause it says here
on the phone records

16:56.102 --> 16:57.929
that he called here
three months ago?

16:57.973 --> 16:59.931
Every now and then,
he would call, asking for money.

16:59.975 --> 17:01.542
For drugs.
So, whenever I would see

17:01.585 --> 17:02.891
his name on the caller I.D.,

17:02.934 --> 17:04.806
I would just hand
the phone to Jeremy.

17:04.849 --> 17:07.417
And did Kevin mention having
trouble with anyone?

17:07.461 --> 17:08.592
A drug dealer, maybe?

17:08.636 --> 17:09.680
Last time we spoke, he said

17:09.724 --> 17:10.942
he owed somebody a lot of money.

17:10.986 --> 17:12.640
I didn't care
to ask who.

17:12.683 --> 17:15.860
Right. Well, I'm not saying this
was a complete waste of time,

17:15.904 --> 17:18.472
but... it was.

17:18.515 --> 17:20.691
[coughs]
[groans]

17:20.735 --> 17:23.694
Mm. So... so then,

17:23.738 --> 17:28.177
I said, "You can
stick that brief

17:28.221 --> 17:30.658
in the circular file
under your robe."

17:30.701 --> 17:33.661
[both laugh]

17:33.704 --> 17:35.924
Hint: it's his butt.

17:35.967 --> 17:37.969

26:53.350 --> 26:54.917
At least now we know
that whoever hired

26:54.961 --> 26:56.876
that exceptionally talented
actor from Bones

26:56.919 --> 26:59.966
may well be our killer. Hmm?

27:00.009 --> 27:02.359
So, um...
It says, says here

27:02.403 --> 27:04.971
the Masquerade office
is in Hollywood. I'm driving.

27:05.014 --> 27:07.538
Lucifer.

27:07.582 --> 27:10.063
I won't be able to get a warrant
until tomorrow morning.

27:10.106 --> 27:11.586
No. No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.414
It-it is imperative
that we go now.

27:13.457 --> 27:15.242
It's imperative that you sleep.

27:15.285 --> 27:16.809
You clearly...

27:16.852 --> 27:18.245
I can't sleep!

27:21.596 --> 27:23.076
Detective, I can't sleep.

27:33.913 --> 27:35.741
[sighs]

27:37.090 --> 27:38.526
Lucifer.

27:40.049 --> 27:42.878
I've had it.What-- you won't
understand, really.

27:42.922 --> 27:45.533
Hmm?It's my wings. They're back.

27:45.576 --> 27:46.882
My Father, he's manipulating me.

27:46.926 --> 27:48.928
He's making me do things
that I would never do.

27:48.971 --> 27:50.799
What? Like flying
through the night,

27:50.843 --> 27:52.540
helping people
like some rogue angel?

27:52.583 --> 27:53.889
Yes! Yes, exactly!Uh-huh.

27:53.933 --> 27:56.718
That is the only
plausible explanation. [laughs]

27:56.762 --> 27:58.764
Either that or Linda's right,
and I'm suppressing

27:58.807 --> 28:01.462
pent-up feelings
about you and Pierce,

28:01.505 --> 28:03.725
which is obviously absurd.

28:03.769 --> 28:05.727
You hate that I'm with him.

28:05.771 --> 28:08.556
I couldn't care less that you're
with that insolent dullard.

28:08.599 --> 28:10.036
We both know that's not true,

28:10.079 --> 28:13.474
but what I want to know is why
it bothers you so much.

28:13.517 --> 28:17.739
Because, Detective, I happen
to know him better than you,

28:17.783 --> 28:19.741
and I know that
you can't trust him.

28:19.785 --> 28:21.090
Care to elaborate on that?

28:21.134 --> 28:23.440
I... Yeah.

28:23.484 --> 28:26.269
Fine, I will, because you
deserve to know the truth.Yes.

28:26.313 --> 28:28.054
Yes, okay.

28:28.097 --> 28:30.012
Pierce isn't Pierce.

28:30.056 --> 28:31.884
He's Kane from the Bible.

28:31.927 --> 28:33.624
And he's immortal.
He's been around for eons.

28:33.668 --> 28:35.539
And all he cares about
is ridding himself

28:35.583 --> 28:38.412
of that stupid curse
that my Father put on him...Stop.

28:38.455 --> 28:40.936
...because he killed
his brother.
Stop!

28:40.980 --> 28:43.460
You're tired, and you're
not thinking clearly.No...

28:43.504 --> 28:45.941
No, I'm-- it's not because
I'm tired, Detective!And...

28:45.985 --> 28:49.771
But since you
brought it up,

28:49.815 --> 28:54.297
let me tell you what
I think about Marcus.

28:54.341 --> 28:57.910
He is a good man

28:57.953 --> 28:59.302
who treats me right.

29:00.739 --> 29:03.437
And I'm happy, Lucifer.

29:03.480 --> 29:06.875
And all I know is how I feel
when I'm around him,

29:06.919 --> 29:09.095
and, you know, I l...

29:10.400 --> 29:11.619
I...

29:13.142 --> 29:15.754
We're done here.

29:23.239 --> 29:24.545
SALESMAN:
Seven carats

29:24.588 --> 29:26.677
of pure bliss.

29:26.721 --> 29:29.985
Don't you deserve
a little indulgence?

29:30.029 --> 29:31.160
I'll take it.

29:31.204 --> 29:33.336
[knock on door]Hey.

29:33.380 --> 29:34.642
You got a second?

29:34.685 --> 29:36.992
For you, Amenadiel, always.

29:37.036 --> 29:39.473
Don't go too far.

29:42.215 --> 29:46.567
Dan called me.
He's worried about you.

29:46.610 --> 29:50.310
Well, all is good.
In fact, it's better than good.

29:50.353 --> 29:51.659
It's perfect.

29:51.702 --> 29:54.009
Yeah, what about that
Spartan lifestyle?

29:54.053 --> 29:57.012
What can I say? Things change.

29:57.056 --> 29:58.405
And why is that?

29:58.448 --> 30:02.322
Because when you know
a pair of angels that can

30:02.365 --> 30:04.541
zip you up to Heaven
when the time comes,

30:04.585 --> 30:06.239
worrying is a waste of time.

30:10.547 --> 30:12.723
That's not how it works,
Charlotte.

30:12.767 --> 30:15.378
What do you mean?Okay, look.

30:15.422 --> 30:19.382
Neither I nor Lucifer have the
power to get anyone into Heaven.

30:19.426 --> 30:21.341
I don't have my wings,

30:21.384 --> 30:23.996
and Lucifer, well,

30:24.039 --> 30:26.389
he is, uh, most unwelcome.

30:26.433 --> 30:27.869
So the only thing
that matters,

30:27.913 --> 30:30.350
Charlotte, truly,
is who you are.

30:30.393 --> 30:32.874
It's okay.

30:32.918 --> 30:34.397
Nothing's changed.

30:34.441 --> 30:37.879
No, don't you see?
That's the problem.

30:37.923 --> 30:40.534
The second I thought
I had a free pass,

30:40.577 --> 30:42.753
an excuse not to be good,

30:42.797 --> 30:47.149
I relapsed into my old ways,

30:47.193 --> 30:49.630
into who I really am.

30:54.635 --> 30:57.029
There's no hope for me.

30:57.072 --> 30:59.553
Amenadiel, I can't change.

31:02.643 --> 31:05.646
I'm going to Hell.

31:07.430 --> 31:09.563
[gasps]

31:16.918 --> 31:18.572
Mommy.
CHLOE:
Hmm?

31:18.615 --> 31:20.443
Did you know if you're
ever mean to me,

31:20.487 --> 31:22.924
I can just go on this site
and order a new mommy?

31:22.968 --> 31:25.144
Oh, yeah? How you
gonna pay for that?

31:25.187 --> 31:26.580
Your credit card.

31:26.623 --> 31:29.278
I've gotten pretty good
at your signature, you know.

31:29.322 --> 31:31.802
I don't doubt that.
All right, come on.

31:31.846 --> 31:33.587
Let's go get some
pizza and ice cream

31:33.630 --> 31:34.805
on the way home.

31:34.849 --> 31:35.981
[mouthing]

31:37.156 --> 31:38.113
He seems nice.

31:38.157 --> 31:41.856
He is nice. You know, Monkey,

31:41.900 --> 31:43.684
since Daddy,

31:43.727 --> 31:48.254
I haven't really dated anyone...
well, seriously.

31:48.297 --> 31:49.342
And, uh...

31:49.385 --> 31:50.952
Marcus and I,

31:50.996 --> 31:53.781
we've been spending
a lot of time together.

31:53.824 --> 31:57.350
And the truth is...
I like him, a lot.

31:57.393 --> 32:01.267
And it's just so important to me
that you're okay with that.

32:01.310 --> 32:03.356
Is he the reason
you've been so happy lately?

32:06.315 --> 32:07.838
I think so.

32:07.882 --> 32:10.319
Does he like chocolate cake?

32:10.363 --> 32:11.842
You know what,
I don't know.

32:11.886 --> 32:13.235
Let's ask him.

32:15.281 --> 32:16.891
All right.
[clears throat]

32:18.893 --> 32:20.025
Oh, my God.

32:22.070 --> 32:23.637
What is it, Mommy?

32:23.680 --> 32:25.334
That's Jeremy Bell.

32:25.378 --> 32:27.989
The husband we interviewed.

32:28.033 --> 32:30.035
Hello?

32:32.385 --> 32:34.865
[wind whistling]

32:34.909 --> 32:38.478
Anyone there?

32:46.616 --> 32:49.228
LUCIFER:
Trouble sleeping?

32:59.760 --> 33:01.240
Mr. Morningstar,
what are you doing here?

33:01.283 --> 33:04.373
Shh. It's probably best
not to wake your family.

33:04.417 --> 33:08.029
Even though...

33:08.073 --> 33:09.683
they're not your family.

33:09.726 --> 33:11.206
I just came
from Masquerade

33:11.250 --> 33:14.122
where a most cooperative
employee

33:14.166 --> 33:16.559
helped me connect the dots.

33:16.603 --> 33:19.562
So, you used to be an actor.

33:19.606 --> 33:21.695
We're in L.A., everybody
used to be an actor.

33:21.738 --> 33:24.698
Mm-hmm, but not everyone gets
such a cushy gig, do they?

33:24.741 --> 33:26.004
Your so-called wife

33:26.047 --> 33:29.790
worried she'd no longer
fit in with the classes

33:29.833 --> 33:33.272
after she broke it off
with her deadbeat baby daddy,

33:33.315 --> 33:36.101
hired you to play
husband and father.

33:36.144 --> 33:38.886
Murdering to keep the gig?

33:38.929 --> 33:40.975
That seems a tad method,
don't you think?

33:41.019 --> 33:42.107
Murder?

33:42.150 --> 33:43.934
Th-That's crazy.

33:43.978 --> 33:45.371
All right, look,
you need to leave

33:45.414 --> 33:46.546
or I'm gonna call the police.

33:46.589 --> 33:48.939
Oh, please.
Spare me the theatrics

33:48.983 --> 33:50.593
because I am in no mood

33:50.637 --> 33:52.769
to hear the half-baked
recitation of innocence

33:52.813 --> 33:56.121
by a, well, mediocre actor.

34:02.431 --> 34:04.303
Was it mediocre acting

34:04.346 --> 34:07.436
that got Mary to actually
fall in love with me?

34:07.480 --> 34:10.091
And Kevin's reappearance
just put all that in jeopardy.

34:10.135 --> 34:11.919
Yeah, I wasn't about
to let that loser

34:11.962 --> 34:14.487
weasel his way back in here.

34:14.530 --> 34:16.837
Just like I'm not gonna let you
mess it up, either.

34:16.880 --> 34:19.622
[chuckles]Too bad you're trespassing.

34:19.666 --> 34:21.059
[grunts]

34:22.321 --> 34:23.757
What the hell?

34:23.800 --> 34:25.193
Most kind of you
to admit your guilt.

34:25.237 --> 34:26.629
The trying to kill me part,
less so.

34:26.673 --> 34:28.022
Aah!

34:28.066 --> 34:30.938
Now, tell me what
I really want to know.

34:30.981 --> 34:33.767
Am I the angel?
What angel?!

34:33.810 --> 34:35.160
Did I stop you
from killing that old woman?

34:35.203 --> 34:37.249
What happened the night
you killed Kevin?!

34:37.292 --> 34:38.815
Okay. I'll tell you.

34:38.859 --> 34:39.816
After I shot him, I ran out.

34:39.860 --> 34:41.644
I bumped into that old lady.

34:41.688 --> 34:43.472
But there was
nobody else there.

34:43.516 --> 34:45.648
She fell into some kind of
religious trance so I bolted!

34:45.692 --> 34:46.649
She saw an angel!

34:46.693 --> 34:49.130
Was it me?!
No! I...

34:49.174 --> 34:52.133
It was a-a shadow
from-from those figurines.

34:52.177 --> 34:54.135
With the figurines, the angel
figurines. Did you plant

34:54.179 --> 34:55.180
the figurine
in my bedroom?!
No, no.

34:55.223 --> 34:56.877
I-I touched one of them.

34:56.920 --> 34:59.271
So I took it, but it had
my prints on it.

34:59.314 --> 35:00.663
I destroyed it right
after. I swear.

35:00.707 --> 35:03.840
Then... how...

35:03.884 --> 35:05.015
[grunts]

35:06.104 --> 35:10.543
I was only trying
to protect my family.

35:10.586 --> 35:13.328
It was never your family
to protect,

35:13.372 --> 35:15.069
you pathetic imposter.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.201
You stole it

35:16.244 --> 35:17.985
from Kevin Winstead.

35:18.028 --> 35:20.379
And then you kept him distracted

35:20.422 --> 35:22.859
by hiring someone
to keep the party going.

35:22.903 --> 35:25.384
Driving him
to self-destruction,

35:25.427 --> 35:29.910
stoking the very fires
of his own weakness...

35:31.564 --> 35:33.131
...to keep him out of the way.

35:34.393 --> 35:36.090
How could I be so blind?

35:47.928 --> 35:50.409
Jeremy Bell? LAPD.

35:54.413 --> 35:56.763
It's all my fault.

35:57.938 --> 35:59.722
I killed Kevin Winstead.

36:01.942 --> 36:03.596
I am a pathetic imposter.

36:12.257 --> 36:13.345
[elevator bell dings]

36:15.608 --> 36:17.218
What are you doing?

36:17.262 --> 36:18.567
I need to find it, Maze.

36:18.611 --> 36:20.134
Find what?

36:20.178 --> 36:21.440
Your self-respect?

36:21.483 --> 36:23.746
The-the angel figurine.
It's here somewhere.

36:23.790 --> 36:26.053
I-I need to find it
so that I can

36:26.096 --> 36:28.838
convince the detective
that Pierce...

36:28.882 --> 36:30.710
isn't who she thinks he is.

36:30.753 --> 36:32.625
What? I don't understand.
Explain.

36:32.668 --> 36:34.540
I figured it out, haven't I?

36:34.583 --> 36:36.846
Pierce has been
gaslighting me.

36:36.890 --> 36:38.065
He's been tricking me
into thinking

36:38.108 --> 36:40.763
I've been doing good deeds
in my sleep.

36:40.807 --> 36:41.895
Why would he do that?

36:41.938 --> 36:43.505
Because...

36:43.549 --> 36:44.898
to keep me away
from the detective

36:44.941 --> 36:46.900
so he can pursue her.

36:46.943 --> 36:48.815
He must be back to thinking
that she's the key to lifting

36:48.858 --> 36:50.077
his bloody curse.

36:50.120 --> 36:51.121
I mean, I tried to warn her,

36:51.165 --> 36:53.123
but she wouldn't
listen, would she?

36:53.167 --> 36:54.516
And why wouldn't she listen?

36:54.560 --> 36:56.257
Because the detective
always needs proof.

36:56.301 --> 36:58.912
And what better proof than
that trinket that he used

36:58.955 --> 37:01.480
to-to-to deceive me?

37:02.655 --> 37:03.960
[laughs]

37:05.223 --> 37:06.485
Wait.

37:08.313 --> 37:09.314
If you want Chloe
to believe you,

37:09.357 --> 37:12.273
you have to do it right.

37:12.317 --> 37:14.797
Take it to Ellen.
Have her do her lab thingy.

37:14.841 --> 37:16.321
Yes, yes, you're right.

37:16.364 --> 37:19.802
First, back up.
Tell me everything.

37:19.846 --> 37:21.848
Start at the beginning.

37:21.891 --> 37:23.458
And don't leave
a single thing out.

37:23.502 --> 37:26.156
It's just...

37:26.200 --> 37:30.160
so hard to put everything
together in my mind, Maze.

37:30.204 --> 37:31.510
I mean, you-you
wouldn't understand.

37:32.641 --> 37:33.642
Thank you.

37:33.686 --> 37:34.774
That's very kind of you.

37:40.388 --> 37:43.478
Which is not like you at all.

37:43.522 --> 37:44.784
Why are you even here?

37:46.046 --> 37:49.005
You're helping him.
Aren't you?

37:49.049 --> 37:51.878
"Helping him"?

37:51.921 --> 37:54.533
This was myidea.

37:55.708 --> 37:58.493
After Pierce told me

about that old lady who
thought she saw an angel,

38:01.017 --> 38:04.369
that's when it all
came together.

38:06.371 --> 38:11.419
I planted the figurine
by your bed.

38:11.463 --> 38:16.685
My neck... is still jacked
from wearing those fake wings

38:16.729 --> 38:17.860
to save that dumb family

38:17.904 --> 38:19.558
in San Bernardino.

38:19.601 --> 38:23.039
You came this close
the other night to waking up

38:23.083 --> 38:25.041
after I took those
handcuffs off.

38:25.085 --> 38:28.349
Thankfully, handcuffs in bed,
I got that.

38:28.393 --> 38:30.917
Why would you do this to me,
Mazikeen?

38:32.919 --> 38:35.182
Because I know
the only thing

38:35.225 --> 38:37.315
that matters to you
more than Chloe.

38:38.403 --> 38:40.709
You.

38:40.753 --> 38:42.885
Easiest way to spin you out.

38:42.929 --> 38:45.279
Tap into those daddy issues.

38:45.323 --> 38:47.673
"I can't get rid
of my wings.

38:47.716 --> 38:50.719
Daddy's controlling me."

Wah, wah, wah.

38:54.419 --> 38:56.943

You're stalling me.

38:56.986 --> 38:58.727

all share it together

39:58.918 --> 40:00.572
tomorrow morning
for breakfast.

40:00.615 --> 40:02.791
You mean I don't have to sneak
out of the house in the morning

40:02.835 --> 40:03.966

40:20.679 --> 40:23.595
All right?
We're both adults

40:23.638 --> 40:24.987

that big a deal.

Did... is it
something I did or said?

we can take this slow.
