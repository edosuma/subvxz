01:18:39.995 --> 01:18:41.602
With a bit of learning to cook

01:18:41.602 --> 01:18:43.987
when you come back then the problem will be reduced

01:18:43.987 --> 01:18:50.541
I think, if Laddo trying to be patient a little bit then everything will be good

01:18:50.994 --> 01:18:54.717
I would not say that, did he already tried it

01:18:54.717 --> 01:18:58.542

When I returned home with a wound in the head

01:20:41.869 --> 01:20:43.420
