16:26.611 --> 16:28.697
- How's he doing?
- [nurse] Okay.

16:28.864 --> 16:31.909
We're taking him down to Radiology
for some tests.

16:32.075 --> 16:36.037
- Can he hear us?
- He's on Serax, it's a sedative.

16:36.204 --> 16:38.039
He kept trying to leave.

16:38.456 --> 16:40.667
- Can I get a minute?
- Now's not a good time.

16:40.834 --> 16:43.336
- Just two minutes.
- I'm sorry.

16:45.088 --> 16:46.590
[Kevin]
Uh...

16:47.632 --> 16:49.593
Uh, John, I spoke to Meg.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.096
[nurse]
Sir.

16:53.764 --> 16:55.640
If there's anything that you need,

16:55.807 --> 16:57.517
maybe you can give us a call, okay?

16:57.976 --> 17:00.645
- You hear me? What is it--?
- [nurse] I've asked you to leave.

17:00.812 --> 17:02.647
- [Kevin] He's trying--
- You need to step out.

17:02.814 --> 17:04.608
- [Kevin] Come on.
- [nurse] You need to step out.

17:04.775 --> 17:07.736
We're gonna take care of everything.
Everything's gonna be okay.

17:07.903 --> 17:09.696
I'm going. I'm going.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.205
When can I see him?

18:01.289 --> 18:03.124
[nurse]
There are forms that need to be filled.

18:03.291 --> 18:06.169
- We asked your daughter, but she left.
- My daughter was here?

18:06.336 --> 18:07.838
[nurse]
She brought Mr. Rayburn in.

18:08.005 --> 18:09.464
[Sally]
Why did she leave?

18:09.547 --> 18:11.716
- [nurse] I'm not sure.
- What about John's wife?

18:11.883 --> 18:13.635
[nurse]
We didn't have that information.

18:13.802 --> 18:15.971
That's why we contacted you.

18:17.138 --> 18:19.223
Kevin? Kevin, what--?

18:19.390 --> 18:21.351
What are you doing here?
How's John?

18:21.518 --> 18:24.479
He seems okay,
but we can't go in there right now.

18:24.646 --> 18:27.816
They're running some tests on him,

18:27.899 --> 18:30.735
so it's probably best
that you just leave him alone.

18:30.902 --> 18:34.031
- Why don't you go on home, Mom?
- What? No. I just got here.

18:34.823 --> 18:36.616
What--? How did you know
John was here?

18:37.116 --> 18:39.995
Um... Meg called me.

18:40.161 --> 18:43.247
- Where is she?
- I, uh... I don't, uh...

18:43.414 --> 18:46.459
- I don't know.
- The receptionist said she left.

18:46.626 --> 18:49.212
- Why would she leave and not call me?
- I don't know.

18:49.379 --> 18:51.089
I'm gonna go find out. Okay?

18:51.756 --> 18:54.051
- Where are you going?
- I'll be right back. Um...

18:54.217 --> 18:55.802
Belle is in town.

18:56.511 --> 18:58.805
She-- I have to go talk to her, okay?

18:58.972 --> 19:00.807
I'm just gonna be--
I'll be right back.

19:00.974 --> 19:02.893
Everything's fine. Don't worry.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.269
[sighs]

19:33.757 --> 19:35.425
Do you know why I pulled you over?

19:35.967 --> 19:38.678
- Was I speeding?
- You were swerving.

19:40.931 --> 19:42.223
Everything okay, miss?

19:43.349 --> 19:46.103
Yeah, I was--
I was, um, coming from the hospital.

19:46.603 --> 19:50.314
I was distracted because
my brother's not feeling well.

Please let me go.

20:31.898 --> 20:34.525
Please.
My brother really is in the hospital.

20:34.692 --> 20:36.653
He's a detective.
Maybe you know him?

20:36.820 --> 20:39.656
John Rayburn,
Monroe County Sheriff Department.

20:39.823 --> 20:41.158
Don't know him.

20:41.324 --> 20:44.161
I gotta run your license.
Wait here.

21:48.391 --> 21:49.642
Your treads are worn.

21:50.143 --> 21:54.272
- How far are you headed?
- I just live two minutes down the road.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.193
I can call you a tow.

21:58.568 --> 22:00.444
No, please.

Please, I just...

22:03.531 --> 22:06.534
I just really wanna go home. Please?

22:13.374 --> 22:14.417
Drive more carefully.

22:15.418 --> 22:17.087

John. Are you okay?

23:51.139 --> 23:52.307
Where is he?

23:54.225 --> 23:56.936
- He's with me.
- Where?

24:03.360 --> 24:06.487
I heard about John. Are you okay?

24:06.654 --> 24:09.115
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- What are you doing out here?

24:09.282 --> 24:12.202

How are you feeling?

24:30.261 --> 24:31.679
Good.

24:32.722 --> 24:34.307
It wasn't a heart attack.

24:34.473 --> 24:36.017
I know.

24:36.184 --> 24:37.643
The doctor told me.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.896
He thinks it was stress-related.

24:40.688 --> 24:44.234
Not surprised, after last night.

24:45.235 --> 24:47.404
Did you talk to Danny after he left?

24:47.945 --> 24:49.239
Uh...

24:50.531 --> 24:52.367
No.

24:56.495 --> 24:58.248
I'm not sure I believe you.

24:58.415 --> 25:01.625
- Mom.
- I know...

25:03.878 --> 25:05.963
you're keeping things from me.

25:06.339 --> 25:08.341
Meg brought you here
and then ran out,

25:08.507 --> 25:09.717
Kevin barely talked to me.

25:09.884 --> 25:13.179
Mom, I think everyone's
a little shaken up, that's all.

25:13.346 --> 25:14.389
That's all.

25:15.306 --> 25:19.436
Last night you said Danny
was gonna come in and talk to you.

25:20.728 --> 25:22.272
He didn't show up.

25:25.775 --> 25:28.445
I know you don't wanna hear this...

25:30.821 --> 25:33.741
but I can't help him anymore.

25:36.535 --> 25:39.580
You don't just give up on family, John.

25:40.039 --> 25:44.502
Mom, I can't help him anymore.

25:47.630 --> 25:49.924
I'll check in with you later.

25:59.642 --> 26:03.354
- You're soaking wet.
- Yeah, I was just going to my car.

26:03.687 --> 26:06.524
Were you getting something
from the trunk? Want help?

26:06.649 --> 26:09.860
No, no, I just--
Putting my suitcases in for New York.

26:10.194 --> 26:12.738

What, you're leaving tonight?

26:13.531 --> 26:16.451
No, tomorrow afternoon.

26:16.617 --> 26:19.954
- It's just for an interview.
- You're putting your bags in the car now?

26:20.037 --> 26:21.956
Uh-huh. Mm-hm.

26:22.457 --> 26:24.083
Since when do you plan
so far ahead?

26:24.250 --> 26:26.461
Why are you asking me
so many questions?

26:26.627 --> 26:27.962
I'm not questioning you, Meg.

26:28.045 --> 26:30.214
- I'm worried.
- I asked you to go to New York.

26:30.298 --> 26:31.632
You don't wanna go, okay?

26:31.715 --> 26:33.676
You pretty much
don't want me in your life.

Don't come to my house
and ask me questions.

26:35.928 --> 26:38.639
I don't have to answer to you anymore,
okay?

I don't care much for hospitals.

Detective Rayburn.

28:09.564 --> 28:11.566
Why did you move him?

28:12.358 --> 28:13.943
We didn't have a choice.

28:14.110 --> 28:16.153
There were people coming.

28:20.658 --> 28:21.909
What happened?

28:23.077 --> 28:24.328
That's not important.

28:25.871 --> 28:29.333
We understand that
whatever you did out there...

28:29.792 --> 28:32.629
you felt like you had to do.

28:33.379 --> 28:36.132
We all know what Danny
was capable of.

28:38.301 --> 28:40.010
Did he have a weapon?

28:42.430 --> 28:43.598
Did he attack you?

28:45.349 --> 28:47.184
[Kevin] Meg, leave him alone.

28:48.102 --> 28:49.646
Were you defending yourself?

28:58.946 --> 29:00.531
No.

29:04.577 --> 29:06.704
He said some things.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.252
And then he walked away.

29:25.264 --> 29:28.309
John, Meg and I
had to make some decisions.

29:30.019 --> 29:31.770
Without you.

29:32.229 --> 29:34.524
Chelsea O'Bannon's car
was parked near yours.

29:34.607 --> 29:37.276
Danny must have driven it over there.

29:39.445 --> 29:42.365
- What did you do with it?
- I moved it to Turtle Head Bay.

29:42.532 --> 29:44.701
I-- I still have the keys. I...

29:44.783 --> 29:46.744
I found Danny's bag
in the back of her car.

29:46.910 --> 29:48.621
Why did you take his fucking bag?

29:48.787 --> 29:52.041
Because I-- We have to just
make this look like he disappeared.

29:52.124 --> 29:54.960
We have to get rid of his stuff.
That's the best thing to do.

29:55.127 --> 29:56.837
The best thing would be do nothing.

29:57.004 --> 29:59.340
Not to move anything.
Not to fucking take anything.

29:59.507 --> 30:02.719
You didn't tell me that. You called me
and you asked me to help you.

30:08.224 --> 30:11.602
What should we have done, John?
Should we have called the cops?

30:21.320 --> 30:23.113
I am not throwing my life away.

30:26.492 --> 30:28.202
Not for him. I'm not doing that.

30:28.369 --> 30:30.705
And you shouldn't, okay?
You shouldn't.

30:37.336 --> 30:39.756
We understand
what he was capable of.

30:39.963 --> 30:42.049
The shit he pulled with Janey?

30:42.216 --> 30:43.634
The drugs at the inn?

30:44.093 --> 30:47.179
We are the only ones who understand.

You two are free of this...

31:09.368 --> 31:11.704

31:16.542 --> 31:19.629
We're not free of this, John.

31:21.130 --> 31:23.382
We just covered it up.

31:28.262 --> 31:31.974
There's no guaranteeing that
this isn't gonna come back on us.

31:32.141 --> 31:36.103
And when it does,
I don't wanna have to try to explain...

31:36.646 --> 31:41.651
why I had my brother's body
in the trunk of my car.

31:42.693 --> 31:46.739
There is no story
that makes that okay.

I thought somebody was

32:20.439 --> 32:23.400
gonna kill him.
You said that, is that true?

32:25.235 --> 32:26.863

I don't know if I can do this.

I can't look her in the eye.
She can see through me.

Don't worry about it. You're doing fine.

- Yeah, let Mom--

Listen, I wanna help you,

35:01.017 --> 35:03.226

You've got a big decision
you gotta make here.

I understand.

35:11.109 --> 35:12.778

Listen, Danny...

35:13.612 --> 35:17.240
you either run, or you talk to the feds
and face the music.

35:17.324 --> 35:19.201
See you back at the house.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.873
Did he say where he was?

35:24.414 --> 35:26.375
No, he didn't.

35:26.458 --> 35:29.211
He knows he's in trouble. He's...

35:31.463 --> 35:32.715
What?

35:35.843 --> 35:38.012
The night he came here...

[Sally sighs]

35:56.196 --> 35:57.907
How did he sound to you?

36:00.367 --> 36:01.744
He sounded scared.

36:03.286 --> 36:04.788
Look...

36:05.288 --> 36:07.374
the good news is he understands
the situation.

36:07.457 --> 36:09.418
I think I got through to him

36:09.501 --> 36:11.545
that the best thing for him to do

36:11.628 --> 36:13.923
is to speak to the authorities
on his own accord,

36:14.006 --> 36:16.092
and he agreed to that.

36:16.633 --> 36:17.509
Well...

36:17.593 --> 36:19.469
When do you think that'll happen?

36:19.553 --> 36:22.723
I have some friends in the DEA.
I talked to them.

36:22.806 --> 36:25.851
It looks like they'll allow him
to come to the pier dedication.

36:27.394 --> 36:30.230
Then they're gonna want to sit down
and talk to him.

36:34.526 --> 36:37.154
That sounds like
it's the best thing to do.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.493
Yeah.

36:44.411 --> 36:45.788
Okay.

36:46.496 --> 36:49.083
At least you'll get to see him
at the ceremony.

36:53.129 --> 36:54.838
[kettle whistling]

36:59.342 --> 37:00.844
Mom.

37:03.806 --> 37:05.015

37:05.515 --> 37:07.267
Oh, no.

37:08.811 --> 37:10.228
[whistling stops]

37:12.982 --> 37:14.900
Make sure he wears his suit.

37:17.027 --> 37:18.403
His seersucker suit.

37:18.487 --> 37:20.990
- It's not important anymore.
- Mom wants him to.

37:21.073 --> 37:23.617
Yes, please, the suit.

37:23.700 --> 37:25.702
[sighs]

37:26.369 --> 37:27.913
Thank you, Meg.

37:30.791 --> 37:31.875
Do you have it?

37:32.584 --> 37:33.961
No.

37:35.921 --> 37:38.007
He must have taken it with him.

37:38.841 --> 37:40.759
I'll tell him to wear it.

37:42.678 --> 37:44.013
Thank you.

37:47.474 --> 37:49.476
[♪♪♪]

38:31.351 --> 38:35.231
[party official] This family
should be a role model for all of us.

38:35.647 --> 38:38.441
What makes the Rayburns so special
is their dedication,

38:38.525 --> 38:40.360
not just to each other,

38:40.443 --> 38:42.238
but to the whole community.

38:43.530 --> 38:47.367
And now I'd like to invite Sally Rayburn
to the podium.

38:49.995 --> 38:51.580
Come on up, Sally.

38:54.583 --> 38:57.377
Well, I see a lot of familiar faces
out there.

38:57.460 --> 38:59.213
Thank you all for coming.

39:00.630 --> 39:02.799
I'm a very lucky woman.

39:03.550 --> 39:04.968
I really am.

39:05.928 --> 39:08.931
My life hasn't been perfect, but, uh...

39:10.266 --> 39:12.475
I've been given more in this life

39:12.559 --> 39:14.770
than anyone ought to expect.

39:16.772 --> 39:19.191
Where I've been lucky most of all

39:19.275 --> 39:21.110
is with my family.

39:22.027 --> 39:23.737
My grandchildren,

39:23.820 --> 39:25.697
Ben and Janey,

39:25.781 --> 39:27.950

39:43.506 --> 39:45.134
It's, uh...

39:46.260 --> 39:48.428
It's you all that keep me going.

39:50.931 --> 39:53.558
[softly] I don't know
what I'd do without you.

39:55.727 --> 39:59.773
This is such a great honor
for all of us Rayburns,

39:59.856 --> 40:02.609
and I know Robert was so thrilled.

40:02.692 --> 40:04.278

So nice to see you again.

40:04.361 --> 40:06.655
- Thank you.
- [Belle] Kevin.

40:06.738 --> 40:08.282
Oh, hey.

40:08.365 --> 40:09.783
- Hi.
- Hi.

40:09.866 --> 40:11.243
I hope it's okay I came.

40:11.327 --> 40:12.869
Yeah, of course it's okay.

40:12.953 --> 40:15.705
I'm sorry I didn't get back to you.
It's... This has--

40:15.789 --> 40:17.291
I know you have stuff going on.

40:17.374 --> 40:19.709
- Yeah.
- I really need to talk to you.

40:20.585 --> 40:22.045
Yeah. Um--

40:22.129 --> 40:23.672
Okay, okay.

40:23.755 --> 40:26.342
I was hoping
I wouldn't have to say this here,

40:26.424 --> 40:29.761
but, um, you remember
the night of your dad's funeral?

40:29.845 --> 40:32.973
Yeah. I remember.

40:33.056 --> 40:35.267
- It was... It was nice.
- Yeah.

40:35.351 --> 40:37.311
It was nice, and...

40:39.396 --> 40:42.024
maybe a little reckless?

40:43.733 --> 40:45.485
What do you mean?

40:50.782 --> 40:52.117
Are you--?

40:52.201 --> 40:53.952
Yeah, I am.

41:01.501 --> 41:04.462
You don't have to say anything now.
I just felt you should know.

41:04.546 --> 41:06.256
I was hoping it'd be good news.

41:06.340 --> 41:07.674
Yeah.

41:07.757 --> 41:09.134
Yeah, it, um--

41:11.678 --> 41:14.223
I'm sorry,
I can't talk about this right now.

41:14.306 --> 41:17.934
Just-- I'll be-- Give me a minute.
I'm sorry. I'll be right back.

41:20.354 --> 41:22.189
When is he gonna do this?

41:24.274 --> 41:27.277
- [people chattering]

41:39.915 --> 41:43.126
I'm sorry he didn't show up.
I thought he'd do the right thing.

41:43.210 --> 41:45.421
It's okay. You did what you could.

41:46.088 --> 41:48.840
I need to go and speak
to some folks over at the DEA

41:48.924 --> 41:51.093
and explain the situation.

41:51.885 --> 41:53.553
Okay.

41:54.679 --> 41:56.556
I'll see you back at the house.

42:53.071 --> 42:54.323
Yeah.

42:58.034 --> 42:59.286
You two?

43:03.290 --> 43:04.333
Listen...

43:05.000 --> 43:07.294
we did what we needed to do.

43:10.672 --> 43:12.757
And it's behind us as of right now.

43:12.841 --> 43:15.511
[Meg] You're not worried
about them finding the body?

43:17.304 --> 43:18.847
[John]
No.

43:19.973 --> 43:22.225
You two need to get on with your lives.

43:28.482 --> 43:31.234
Take that job in New York.
You deserve it.

43:31.318 --> 43:34.237
I don't know how you can talk
about deserving anything.

43:34.737 --> 43:36.281
You can't think like that.

43:36.365 --> 43:37.699
He's right.

43:39.909 --> 43:41.619
You deserve to be happy.

43:44.122 --> 43:45.290
You too, Kevin.

43:46.041 --> 43:49.294
Go back to your wife.
Do what you have to, make it work out.

43:53.715 --> 43:54.883
What about you?

43:57.969 --> 43:59.596
I'll be fine.

44:09.731 --> 44:11.608
You've both been so kind to me.

44:11.733 --> 44:14.861
And to my family,
and I've never said thank you.

44:17.947 --> 44:19.657
I took you for granted.

44:28.875 --> 44:31.253
We never say it in this family.

44:32.212 --> 44:33.838
[Kevin]
Say what?

44:39.511 --> 44:41.054
I love you.

44:55.360 --> 44:57.904
the next sheriff of Monroe County.

44:57.987 --> 44:59.781
Some of you
may know Detective Rayburn.

44:59.864 --> 45:02.242
I'm certain you all know
about the Rayburn family,

45:02.325 --> 45:04.994
from their inn,
their esteemed reputation--

45:05.078 --> 45:06.538
Or from...

45:06.996 --> 45:09.625
recent newspaper accounts
about my brother.

45:10.083 --> 45:14.254
As well as his being wanted in connection
with the murder at the Red Reef Motel.

45:15.255 --> 45:16.965
[classical music playing over speakers]

45:17.048 --> 45:19.384
I know you all have questions.

45:19.468 --> 45:22.137
I'd like to address
those concerns now if I may.

45:22.220 --> 45:24.556
[party official]
Floor's all yours, John.

45:27.517 --> 45:31.062
I always thought the greatest thing
that happened to me

45:31.146 --> 45:33.106
was being born a Rayburn.

45:33.856 --> 45:35.858
[♪♪♪]

45:41.531 --> 45:43.492
Now I'm not so sure.

45:47.537 --> 45:49.872
I'm gonna tell you everything.

45:50.915 --> 45:52.917
It's not very pleasant.

45:54.419 --> 45:56.296
But it's the truth.

46:00.383 --> 46:03.637
Sometimes,
you know something's coming.

46:04.137 --> 46:07.683
That's how I felt
when my brother came home.

46:07.765 --> 46:10.226
And my brother Kevin is
the hothead of the family.

46:10.310 --> 46:12.729
Truth is, he's a lot like my father.

46:12.812 --> 46:14.981
Maybe it was Meg's decision
that started this thing.

46:15.064 --> 46:17.066
Still, I can't blame her
for what she did.

46:17.150 --> 46:18.151
Whatever mistakes...

46:18.234 --> 46:19.986
Could this whole thing have been avoided?

46:20.069 --> 46:21.363
Probably.

46:21.446 --> 46:22.780
Danny turned us into that family.

46:22.864 --> 46:23.990
And I'm not the same man now.

46:24.073 --> 46:25.534
People say he's a monster.

46:25.617 --> 46:26.868
He did terrible things.

46:26.951 --> 46:28.578
He made a big mistake.

46:28.662 --> 46:30.121
And now we're all paying for it.

46:30.205 --> 46:31.956
I feel sorry for him.

46:36.628 --> 46:39.964
In a way it wasn't just him
I was trying to save.

46:40.590 --> 46:42.925
I was trying to save myself.

46:44.886 --> 46:46.929
We're not bad people.

46:48.473 --> 46:50.684
But we did a bad thing.

46:51.226 --> 46:53.186
[man]
What do you mean by that?

46:53.853 --> 46:57.440
We never treated my brother Danny
like he was one of our own.

46:58.650 --> 47:01.152
So if he went astray...

47:02.195 --> 47:04.740
we all bear some of the blame.

47:09.661 --> 47:12.288
I wish I knew what happened to him.

47:13.749 --> 47:15.917
But wherever he is...

47:16.959 --> 47:19.087
I hope he's okay.

47:22.006 --> 47:24.092
And I hope he knows...

I love him.

Nicely done. You won them over.

47:47.031 --> 47:49.576
- I'm not so sure about that.
- Trust me.

47:49.659 --> 47:51.828
I've been around long enough to know.

47:51.911 --> 47:53.663
You're on your way.

47:54.456 --> 47:58.293
Thank you for meeting me halfway.

47:59.001 --> 48:00.545
I know it was a long drive.

48:00.629 --> 48:02.631
No, it's fine. Fine.

48:04.758 --> 48:08.344
I'm so sorry that I avoided you
at Robert's funeral.

48:08.428 --> 48:10.054
Oh, that's all right.

48:10.138 --> 48:12.181
You had a lot on your plate.

48:15.518 --> 48:17.353
I was ashamed.

48:19.063 --> 48:21.441
What do you have
to be ashamed about?

48:26.154 --> 48:28.782
I told my children to lie to you.

48:30.659 --> 48:32.786
After Sarah died.

48:34.412 --> 48:37.081
I made them tell you that story.

48:44.255 --> 48:46.215
Danny paid for it.

48:48.176 --> 48:50.094
I understand, Sally.

48:51.721 --> 48:54.683
I just don't know what I can do to help.

48:57.018 --> 48:59.061
Have you talked to John?

48:59.688 --> 49:02.273
I think John's given up on Danny.

49:06.068 --> 49:08.279
Sally, what do you want me to do?

49:10.031 --> 49:11.867
I want you to find Danny.

49:12.701 --> 49:14.828
Wherever he is, whatever he's doing.

Please, just...

Mm-mm.

about how he was found.

That's so...

51:16.699 --> 51:18.117
awful.

But it would have been harder for Sally

51:22.580 --> 51:24.666
So I don't know.

51:25.333 --> 51:27.627
Maybe it's better this way.

We have some questions to ask you.

52:22.431 --> 52:25.393
Medical examiner sent us his report.

52:25.476 --> 52:27.812
The cause of Danny's death
wasn't burning.

52:28.521 --> 52:30.732
His lungs were filled with water.

52:35.194 --> 52:37.238
He drowned, John.

Someone was probably trying

in the same direction.

52:53.504 --> 52:55.172
What direction is that?

52:56.257 --> 53:00.386
John, you said that Danny was going
to the pier dedication, right?

53:00.469 --> 53:03.264
He said he was,
but I'm not surprised he didn't show up.

53:03.347 --> 53:04.432
Why not?

53:04.515 --> 53:06.601
He knew you were
gonna interrogate him after.

he was prepared for that.

were two very different things.

53:22.324 --> 53:24.702
[Marco] And you didn't speak to him
after the ceremony?

53:25.327 --> 53:26.579
No.

53:26.662 --> 53:28.123
Never saw him?

53:30.625 --> 53:31.960
No.

53:32.501 --> 53:34.503
Chelsea O'Bannon
said that she warned you

53:34.587 --> 53:36.756
about somebody coming after Danny.

53:39.592 --> 53:43.345
She came to me. I called Danny,
I went to the motel. He wasn't there.

53:47.892 --> 53:49.727
Is there something
you aren't telling me?

53:49.811 --> 53:51.687
I'm beginning to feel like a suspect.

53:51.771 --> 53:53.355
Why would you be a suspect, John?

53:53.856 --> 53:56.151
I don't know.
Why don't you get to the point?

53:56.192 --> 53:59.612
John, the drugs on your family's property.
We found them.

54:01.530 --> 54:03.532
[♪♪♪]

54:05.326 --> 54:07.286
[sirens wailing]

54:07.620 --> 54:10.165
- [Clay] We clear?
- Where?

54:10.247 --> 54:12.458
Did you know Danny had
an apartment in Miami?

54:13.209 --> 54:14.210
Yeah.

54:16.087 --> 54:18.214
[Clay]
Well, we took a little drive up there.

54:22.259 --> 54:24.762
- Found a shitload of narcotics.
- A shitload, John.

54:29.558 --> 54:31.560
No way Danny could have had
that much shit.

54:35.314 --> 54:37.650
Unless he stole it from Wayne Lowry.

54:38.234 --> 54:40.236
[♪♪♪]

54:40.778 --> 54:42.571
[John]
I'm gonna need your help with this.

54:42.655 --> 54:43.823
[Kevin]
What is it?

54:44.406 --> 54:46.242
Why didn't you get rid of it?

54:46.742 --> 54:48.703
I thought it might be useful.

54:49.996 --> 54:52.581
I just didn't realize
I'd be using it for this.

55:03.676 --> 55:06.221
After he moved it
from your property, it, uh--

55:06.888 --> 55:09.348
It appears he kept it for himself.

55:10.558 --> 55:13.853
Doesn't make sense. Where would
he find the time to move that to Miami?

55:13.936 --> 55:16.064
Chelsea O'Bannon got a message
from Danny.

55:17.732 --> 55:20.818
He had her car.
Texted he was going up that way.

55:25.156 --> 55:26.866
Yeah, but he came back.

55:26.949 --> 55:29.077
We found Chelsea's car
about half a mile away

55:29.160 --> 55:30.828
from where Danny's body washed up.

55:32.038 --> 55:33.539
[John]
What did you do with it?

55:33.622 --> 55:35.583
I moved it to Turtle Head Bay.

55:36.542 --> 55:38.627
I still have the keys.

55:38.711 --> 55:41.505
I found Danny's bag
in the back of her car.

55:45.051 --> 55:46.552
His possessions were in the car.

55:46.635 --> 55:50.639
His clothes, his keys,
his cigarettes, his cell phone.

55:53.642 --> 55:55.686
The day before the pier dedication,

55:55.770 --> 55:57.688
Danny called Wayne Lowry.

55:58.522 --> 55:59.732
Good morning.

55:59.815 --> 56:01.943
We checked his phone records, John.

56:02.026 --> 56:05.988
Listen, I'm thinking
about going out to Indian Key

56:06.072 --> 56:08.657
and trying to catch
maybe some pompano.

56:15.039 --> 56:16.624
What are you thinking?

56:16.707 --> 56:19.294
You got a theory
to make sense of all this?

56:21.296 --> 56:23.798
[Marco]
We ID'd the victim in the motel.

56:24.715 --> 56:26.634
He's linked to Wayne Lowry.

56:26.717 --> 56:29.178
[Clay]
Lowry's out two million in coke.

56:29.678 --> 56:31.597
He sent this guy to go
after your brother.

56:31.680 --> 56:34.433
We think that Danny set up
a meeting with Lowry,

56:34.516 --> 56:37.145
you know, hoping to make peace.

56:37.228 --> 56:40.106
Wipe the slate clean
before the pier dedication.

56:40.189 --> 56:43.276
Lowry wasn't interested
in making peace.

56:43.359 --> 56:45.111
He had your brother killed.

56:49.157 --> 56:51.159
He tried to get rid of the body
on the boat.

57:02.920 --> 57:05.047
Same MO as the girls.

57:16.184 --> 57:18.311
You're basing all this...

57:19.687 --> 57:22.064
on the drugs found
in Danny's apartment...

57:24.275 --> 57:26.610
a phone call
and a fucking text message?

57:29.905 --> 57:31.324
Well, hey...

57:32.491 --> 57:34.076
what are you thinking?

57:38.873 --> 57:40.875
I'm not thinking anything.

57:42.960 --> 57:44.837
I just lost a brother.

57:45.754 --> 57:48.424
[Marco]
I'm sorry, John, but the pieces fit.

57:49.384 --> 57:52.136
And you may be too close to it to...

57:52.220 --> 57:53.888
To have perspective.

57:58.434 --> 58:00.061
[John]
You're probably right.

58:01.020 --> 58:03.105
We're bringing Lowry in now.

58:04.148 --> 58:06.150
Let's see what he has to say.

58:11.572 --> 58:12.948
Yeah.

58:14.742 --> 58:15.993
Yeah.

58:23.042 --> 58:25.044
[♪♪♪]

58:26.837 --> 58:28.047
How did you know for sure

58:28.130 --> 58:30.466
Danny was gonna show up
at that pier dedication?

58:30.549 --> 58:32.301
[Marco]
He was wearing a suit.

58:34.220 --> 58:35.888
Seersucker.

58:48.109 --> 58:49.818
[Alec]
Yeah, um, I can't do this right now.

58:49.902 --> 58:52.363
Let's talk in the late morning. Yeah.

58:53.114 --> 58:54.449
Okay.

58:54.531 --> 58:56.575
Alec? What a nice surprise.

58:56.658 --> 58:58.535
Susannah, hey. Good to see you.

58:58.619 --> 59:00.537
Let me call you back. Okay.

59:00.621 --> 59:02.457
Sorry, have you been waiting long?

59:02.539 --> 59:04.666
No, work days are longer up here.

59:05.376 --> 59:08.003
I've got kids to get home to,
so I'll see you tomorrow.

59:08.087 --> 59:09.171
Nice to see you, Alec.

59:09.255 --> 59:10.631
- Good night.
- Good night.

59:11.673 --> 59:13.634
- Hi.
- Hello.

59:14.343 --> 59:16.929
Well, you must be busier
than I thought.

59:17.679 --> 59:18.680
Why?

59:18.764 --> 59:20.891
Well, it took you
a whole month to call me.

59:20.975 --> 59:22.310
[both chuckle]

59:25.646 --> 59:26.855
Wow.

59:29.358 --> 59:31.860
It's nice to have a different view.

59:32.487 --> 59:34.196
You glad you took the job?

59:36.449 --> 59:38.033
Think you made the right decision?

59:41.162 --> 59:42.497
Yeah.

59:43.205 --> 59:44.748
Yeah, I think so.

59:45.166 --> 59:46.250
Good.

59:46.334 --> 59:48.544
A buddy of mine has a place
that's a block away.

59:48.627 --> 59:51.339
Uh, so nice to cook in this kitchen again.

59:51.422 --> 59:53.090
[Kevin]
Yeah, don't get used to it.

59:53.174 --> 59:54.883
Belle, what is--? Come on.

59:54.967 --> 59:58.804
- This is just rabbit food now.
- You agreed to eat healthy.

59:58.887 --> 1:00:01.098
No, I didn't.
I agreed you should eat healthy.

1:00:01.182 --> 1:00:03.976
It's called solidarity.
We all eat as a family.

1:00:04.059 --> 1:00:05.769
Or I could just kick you out again

1:00:05.853 --> 1:00:08.356
- and you could get a dog instead.
- It'd be cheaper.

1:00:08.439 --> 1:00:10.774
No college tuition,

1:00:10.858 --> 1:00:12.651
no summer camp.

1:00:12.818 --> 1:00:14.820
[rock ballad playing over speakers]

1:00:17.031 --> 1:00:18.824
Is there really something in there?

1:00:19.867 --> 1:00:21.076
Maybe not.

1:00:21.160 --> 1:00:24.621
Maybe I'm just puking every morning
because I'm waking up next to you.

1:00:24.705 --> 1:00:26.207
- There she is.
- [laughs]

1:00:26.290 --> 1:00:28.083
There she is, the woman I love.

1:00:28.167 --> 1:00:30.085
[Belle]
Heh. Grab a knife, make yourself useful.

1:00:30.752 --> 1:00:32.296
Do you really want to be sheriff?

1:00:32.380 --> 1:00:35.716
Honey, I'm not gonna do anything
unless everyone agrees on it.

1:00:35.799 --> 1:00:38.260
- Might be cool.
- It might be a big headache.

1:00:38.344 --> 1:00:40.929
- [John] We'll see.
- Whatever.

1:00:41.013 --> 1:00:42.348
I say do it.

1:00:45.601 --> 1:00:47.686
[Potts]
I wish I could have done more.

1:00:48.187 --> 1:00:49.480
Now.

1:00:49.897 --> 1:00:51.273
Before.

1:00:53.609 --> 1:00:55.403
You cared.

1:00:56.612 --> 1:00:58.239
And you tried.

1:01:00.241 --> 1:01:02.451
I couldn't have asked for more.

1:01:04.703 --> 1:01:07.248
Danny made his own choices, Sally.

1:01:09.208 --> 1:01:11.544
You can't blame yourself for this.

1:01:17.258 --> 1:01:19.385
I couldn't help Danny,

1:01:19.468 --> 1:01:21.678
but I found out some things.

1:01:27.518 --> 1:01:28.810
What?

1:01:31.688 --> 1:01:34.316
Your children are lying to you.

1:01:38.654 --> 1:01:41.115
- [Janey] I have to go.
- [Diana] No, you're not gonna run off.

1:01:41.198 --> 1:01:42.450
[Janey] I'm meeting my friends.

1:01:42.533 --> 1:01:44.952
Can you put that thing down?
We're having dinner.

1:01:45.035 --> 1:01:47.788
- It's important.
- Yeah, I know. Everything's important.

1:01:47.871 --> 1:01:50.124
That means nothing is important.

1:01:50.207 --> 1:01:52.543
- Nothing in my life's important to you?
- [John] No.

1:01:52.627 --> 1:01:55.796
I don't want to argue with my beautiful,
lovely, wonderful daughter.

1:01:55.879 --> 1:01:57.590
I'm just trying to have conversation.

1:01:58.132 --> 1:02:00.551
- Sweetie--
- Dad. Who's that?

1:02:03.304 --> 1:02:05.306
[♪♪♪]

1:02:13.606 --> 1:02:15.816
- [boy] Are you John?
- [John] Can I help you?

1:02:17.693 --> 1:02:19.987
Danny Rayburn was your brother, right?

1:02:28.412 --> 1:02:29.830
That's right.

1:02:32.667 --> 1:02:34.543
I need to talk to you.

1:02:35.919 --> 1:02:38.297
And what is it you want to talk about?

1:02:40.508 --> 1:02:42.384
What happened to him.

1:02:48.390 --> 1:02:50.267
And why is that?

1:02:52.436 --> 1:02:54.271
He was my dad.
