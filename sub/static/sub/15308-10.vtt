Hey, you looked great up there.

00:43.306 --> 00:44.457
Are we really doing this?

You're really gonna act
like everything's normal?

00:45.876 --> 00:47.544
Maya, we need to talk.

00:47.627 --> 00:49.963
You cheated on me, Zig, and
then lied about it for weeks.

00:50.047 --> 00:52.925
[stammering] I know... and I'm so sorry.

00:53.008 --> 00:54.384
Have you guys seen Jonah?

00:56.719 --> 00:58.555
Okay, never mind. I'll keep looking.

01:00.140 --> 01:01.724
I thought that we were over.

01:03.283 --> 01:04.644
Please don't let us be over.

Why should I forgive you?

I wish I could take back the
moment that Zoë kissed me, but...

01:10.025 --> 01:11.359
It was just a kiss?

01:12.735 --> 01:14.196
Yeah, basically.

Staying far away from this

02:42.242 --> 02:44.161
See you in the Voodoo Lands.

Do you, um, maybe wanna go to
the Snow Ball with me tonight?

02:46.871 --> 02:50.417
To watch hormone-laden adolescents
grope each other in the gymnasium?

02:50.500 --> 02:52.294
[scoffs] Never mind. Stupid idea.

02:52.377 --> 02:53.586
I'm in.

02:54.629 --> 02:57.382
- Great. I'll buy tickets.
- And, uh, get me a corsage, too.

02:57.465 --> 02:59.384
Yeah, of course.

02:59.467 --> 03:03.055

[whispering] Maybe we're
getting nominated for an award.

03:06.308 --> 03:08.685
Obviously, the school found
out that we trolled Maya.

03:08.768 --> 03:11.396
Even if they suspect
us, they have zero proof.

03:11.479 --> 03:13.731
- So what do we do?
- Deny everything.

03:14.649 --> 03:16.609
Winston wants to know
the color of my dress.

03:16.693 --> 03:18.445
So he can buy you a corsage. Sweet.

03:18.528 --> 03:20.238
I don't even know what I'm wearing.

03:20.322 --> 03:21.614
The semi-formal's tonight.

03:21.698 --> 03:23.575
Yeah, I was just gonna throw something on.

03:23.658 --> 03:25.410
- You will not.
- Lo, breathe.

03:25.493 --> 03:27.704
If all goes well, you and
Winston will get back together.

03:27.787 --> 03:29.998
- Uh, that's not a sure thing.
- Not if you just throw something on.

03:30.082 --> 03:32.042
You need to convince Winston
that you two are perfect together.

03:32.125 --> 03:33.501

Just looking at that smoothie

04:18.088 --> 04:19.464
Hey, if you're sick, stay away,

04:19.547 --> 04:21.298
'cause I can't miss my big event tonight.

04:21.382 --> 04:22.425

04:22.509 --> 04:25.262
People are saying that the
Snow Ball will be memorable.

04:25.345 --> 04:27.430
No thanks to you. How many tickets?

04:27.514 --> 04:29.516
I can't come. Big events are triggers.

04:29.599 --> 04:31.351
Then why are you here?

04:32.602 --> 04:35.147
I'm going to boarding school next semester.

04:35.230 --> 04:37.065
Mom and I decided that
I need a fresh start,

04:37.149 --> 04:39.817
to get away from all the bad influences.

04:39.901 --> 04:43.280
So, uh... goodbye, I
guess. And... [inhales]

04:43.363 --> 04:44.364
I'm sorry.

04:45.025 --> 04:45.907
For what?

04:45.991 --> 04:48.326
[chuckles] Take your pick.

04:52.414 --> 04:54.207
[Maya] <i>Then there was the swatting.</i>

04:54.291 --> 04:56.584
When I saw those guns,

04:56.668 --> 04:58.628
I thought someone was
coming in to kill me...

04:59.254 --> 05:01.339
and I've never been so scared in my life.

05:04.842 --> 05:06.053
[crying] I'm sorry...

05:07.137 --> 05:08.930
That you overreacted.

05:09.931 --> 05:12.309
I'm sure whoever was responsible
thought it was some sort of joke.

05:12.392 --> 05:14.727
Mrs. Matlin says Maya wakes up every
night screaming, "Don't hurt me."

05:14.811 --> 05:17.147
- Mr. Simpson...
- That's not a joke.

05:17.230 --> 05:18.815
Now, the Matlins won't press
charges if those persons

05:18.898 --> 05:21.443
responsible for the trolling come forward.

05:22.402 --> 05:24.321
The swatting, obviously,
is up to the police.

05:25.530 --> 05:28.825
So I ask you, are any of you responsible?

05:33.246 --> 05:34.581
Yes.

05:34.664 --> 05:36.583
I'm so, so, so sorry.

05:36.666 --> 05:37.959
[Baaz] We didn't mean to hurt anyone.

05:38.042 --> 05:40.670
Um, also, any chance we can
keep this from my parents?

05:42.339 --> 05:43.715
Didn't think so.

05:43.798 --> 05:45.383
[Simpson] Hunter, anything to add?

05:46.840 --> 05:48.133
You deserve what you got.

05:51.013 --> 05:52.099
Maya, you can go.

05:59.772 --> 06:01.108
[Maya sighs]

06:01.286 --> 06:04.771
Hey... how'd that go?

06:12.076 --> 06:13.161
Have you seen Mom?

06:13.245 --> 06:14.537
I need to go shopping for the Snow Ball.

06:14.621 --> 06:16.373
You have, like, three
closets full of clothes.

06:16.456 --> 06:17.707
None of them feel right.

06:18.708 --> 06:20.001
[Winston] You'll look great in anything.

06:21.211 --> 06:23.171
Winston, you're here.

06:24.172 --> 06:26.090
[sighs] Oh, no. I lost track of time.

06:26.174 --> 06:27.884
Well, you're worth waiting for.

06:27.967 --> 06:31.095
Plus, this might help you pick a dress.

06:34.932 --> 06:36.309
Silver goes with everything, right?

06:36.393 --> 06:38.270
You didn't need to buy this,

06:38.353 --> 06:39.604
especially after the flowers.

06:39.687 --> 06:40.772
What flowers?

06:44.747 --> 06:45.748
Oh.

06:46.278 --> 06:48.446
Um... never mind.

06:48.530 --> 06:50.282
You like it, don't you?

06:51.533 --> 06:52.784
It's beautiful.

06:55.453 --> 06:56.663
But I can't take it.

06:58.324 --> 06:59.909
And I can't go to the Snow Ball with you.

07:01.793 --> 07:03.420
Who is he?

07:03.503 --> 07:06.047
If... if you're ditching me on
the night of the dance, it's...

07:06.131 --> 07:07.299
it's for another guy.

07:07.382 --> 07:09.259
It's not like that.

07:09.342 --> 07:10.968
Besides, I don't even
know if it is something.

07:11.052 --> 07:13.054
Whoever it is, wish him luck.

07:13.138 --> 07:14.889
With you, he'll need it.

07:22.647 --> 07:24.774
You guys ruined everything.

07:24.857 --> 07:25.858
We tortured that poor girl enough.

07:25.942 --> 07:27.652
And now we're the ones getting tortured.

07:27.735 --> 07:29.446
I think we got off easy.

07:29.529 --> 07:31.698
Thirty hours of in-school
community service,

07:31.781 --> 07:32.782
which we start at the dance.

07:32.865 --> 07:34.033
I'm running the photo booth.

07:34.116 --> 07:36.661
Yeah, but who knows what's gonna
happen to me because of the swatting?

07:36.744 --> 07:39.497
So Maya should live in fear every day?

07:39.622 --> 07:40.790
Is that what you think?

07:40.873 --> 07:43.543
This isn't about her. This is
about correcting a social injustice.

07:43.626 --> 07:44.794
Answer the question.

07:44.877 --> 07:46.003
Get out of my face.

07:46.087 --> 07:47.672
Not until I find out if my
best friend is a sociopath.

07:47.755 --> 07:49.382
- Get away!
- [Yael gasps]

07:51.301 --> 07:53.928
- I'm sorry.
- You need to go.

07:55.222 --> 07:56.473
Now!

08:04.564 --> 08:06.566
And then we could end with "Not Okay."

08:07.484 --> 08:11.196
Well, you're the boss, but typically,
the last song at a dance is slow.

08:11.279 --> 08:12.989
Then we'll do a cover.

08:13.072 --> 08:14.241
How about "Yes"?

08:14.324 --> 08:16.326
The one you wrote about
how much you love Zig.

08:16.409 --> 08:17.452
No!

08:22.707 --> 08:23.791
You knew.

08:24.751 --> 08:26.753
- I told him to tell you.
- You could've told me.

08:26.836 --> 08:29.381
I tried, but with the trolling, it
never seemed like the right time and...

08:29.464 --> 08:31.799
I am so sick of excuses.

08:31.883 --> 08:33.174
Just leave.

08:33.260 --> 08:35.135
We don't need you to play with us tonight.

[sighs]

08:42.684 --> 08:43.936
[exhales]

08:48.566 --> 08:49.734
Go ahead. Say something.

08:49.817 --> 08:51.528
I have no clue what just happened.

08:52.445 --> 08:54.196
Your sister's a piece of work.

08:55.197 --> 08:56.824
Well, on the bright side,
you get to spend the night

08:56.908 --> 08:58.410
with a better-looking Hollingsworth.

08:58.493 --> 08:59.952
And I guarantee the only drama

09:00.036 --> 09:02.414
- will be at the movies.
- [Hunter] You can't do this!

09:02.497 --> 09:05.542
- Where is my gaming rig?
- [scoffs] It's been confiscated.

09:05.625 --> 09:07.252
- [Hunter groans]
- Oh, your laptop, too.

09:07.335 --> 09:08.961
- Whoa, what's going on?
- She took my computers!

09:09.045 --> 09:10.505
You attacked an innocent girl.

09:10.588 --> 09:12.840
- You're Maya's troll?
- It was a political statement.

09:12.924 --> 09:14.050
And hand over your phone.

09:14.133 --> 09:16.344
No, no, no. Not until I
deal with the Yael situation.

09:16.428 --> 09:17.554
She hates me.

09:17.637 --> 09:19.431
Whatever. I'll cancel your line.

[pottery shatters]

09:23.893 --> 09:25.353
Okay, buddy, you need to calm down.

09:25.437 --> 09:26.813
Shut up! I need to think!

09:26.896 --> 09:28.481
You're overreacting, okay?

09:28.565 --> 09:30.191
Stop telling me what to do!

Yay! You're finally here.
Okay, let's take a pic.

10:14.777 --> 10:16.321
Um... okay, it'll do.

10:19.907 --> 10:21.242
[sighs]

10:21.326 --> 10:22.577
I need to find someone first.

10:22.660 --> 10:25.997
Aw! Do you and Winston have a
secret romantic rendezvous planned?

10:26.080 --> 10:27.289
He's not coming.

10:27.374 --> 10:29.125
I told him I didn't like
him that way anymore.

10:29.208 --> 10:31.210
So you called it off
the night of the dance?

10:31.293 --> 10:32.587
I thought you wanted to be happy.

10:32.670 --> 10:34.213
Winston doesn't make me happy.

10:36.924 --> 10:38.300
- But I think Jonah might.
- [Lola] Okay,

10:38.385 --> 10:41.721
I know you're going through some
crazy mid-high school life crisis,

10:41.804 --> 10:42.930
but Jonah Haak is not the answer.

10:43.014 --> 10:45.433
He'll break your heart, and we'll
be left to pick up the pieces, again.

10:45.517 --> 10:48.561
Because you're the relationship
experts? You're dating her crush.

10:48.645 --> 10:50.605
- Frankie!
- You said you were over Tiny!

10:50.688 --> 10:52.064
How could I be? I liked him for forever,

10:52.148 --> 10:54.233
and he liked me back until you
wiggled your big butt at him.

10:54.316 --> 10:55.818
[gasps] At least I have one.

10:55.902 --> 10:57.404
Are you girls gonna take your pic, or what?

10:58.655 --> 11:00.322
Say cheese.

11:00.407 --> 11:01.658
[shutter clicking]

11:03.200 --> 11:04.994
- [knocking on door]
- [Miles] Hunter?

11:09.582 --> 11:11.876
Obviously, he's not in a social mood.

11:13.377 --> 11:16.047
I wanna make sure he's okay
before we go to the movies.

11:16.130 --> 11:17.173
[knocking on door]

11:17.256 --> 11:19.133
- [Winston] Hunter?
- [knocks on door]

11:19.216 --> 11:20.384
Hey, Hunter.

11:20.968 --> 11:22.887
[Winston sighs] He's not in the bathroom.

11:22.970 --> 11:24.138
