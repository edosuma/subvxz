00:03.436 --> 00:08.140
Woman:
<i>Once upon a time, there was</i>
<i>a reindeer named winston.</i>

00:08.142 --> 00:09.341
(bells jingling)

00:09.343 --> 00:11.410
<i>Winston was lost.</i>

00:11.412 --> 00:15.414
He wandered the city instead of
<i>delivering toys in the frost.</i>

00:15.416 --> 00:17.649
(camera shutters clicking)

00:17.651 --> 00:20.019
Did you get it?
(reindeer grunts)

00:20.021 --> 00:22.154
<i>Winston searched</i>
<i>every roof and chimney.</i>

00:22.156 --> 00:24.223
(women gasping)

00:25.225 --> 00:28.293
<i>Where, oh, where</i>
<i>could jolly santa be?</i>

00:39.305 --> 00:42.508
(siren wails in distance)

00:42.510 --> 00:44.810
Thank you.

00:44.812 --> 00:46.178
(heavy sigh)

00:46.180 --> 00:49.748
Russell:
Not for santa, I hear.
Brass: There's gonna be

00:49.750 --> 00:51.183
A lot of disappointed kids

00:51.185 --> 00:52.818
This year.

00:52.820 --> 00:55.287
Russell:
Wow. Snow in vegas.

00:55.289 --> 00:57.556
Well, this white christmas
is brought to you courtesy of

00:57.558 --> 00:59.658
The winter wonderland company--
the employee jayson walt,

00:59.660 --> 01:00.726
He's over there.

01:00.728 --> 01:03.295
Reindeer wrangler,
snowmaker,

01:03.297 --> 01:05.230
Jack-of-all-trades.
He comes to work this morning,

01:05.232 --> 01:07.366
Finds a dead santa
and a missing reindeer.

01:07.368 --> 01:09.168
They went all out.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.703
Patrol found dasher about
an hour ago on the strip,

01:11.705 --> 01:13.405
Blood in his fur.
Animal control

01:13.407 --> 01:16.108
Brought him here, and jayson
walt identified him as dasher.

01:16.110 --> 01:18.477
David phillips has
the I.D. On the dead guy.

01:18.479 --> 01:19.745
Good luck.

01:23.149 --> 01:24.283
David,

01:24.285 --> 01:26.385
Got a name yet?
Lucky for us

01:26.387 --> 01:29.121
The victim is not
a secret santa.

01:29.123 --> 01:30.789
He's got business cards,
everything.

01:32.192 --> 01:36.562
"brad fante-- your friendly
neighborhood I.T. Guy."

01:36.564 --> 01:38.297
Works for bonham realty.

01:38.299 --> 01:40.265
Must have been
the company kringle.

01:40.267 --> 01:42.301
Liver temp tells me
he died between

01:42.303 --> 01:44.403
12:00 and 1:00 a.M.
And both

01:44.405 --> 01:46.338
Femoral arteries were severed.

01:46.340 --> 01:48.240
So he bled out.
What are those,

01:48.242 --> 01:50.609
Bloody hoofprints?
Looks like it.

01:52.145 --> 01:54.146
So the reindeer

01:54.148 --> 01:56.381
Sees santa here die violently,

01:56.383 --> 01:58.484
Breaks out of the pen,

01:58.486 --> 01:59.818
Tracks through
the fresh blood.

01:59.820 --> 02:02.321
And I thought
rudolph had it bad.

02:07.227 --> 02:09.661
There's blood
on the runner here.

02:09.663 --> 02:12.865
He was definitely run over
by the sleigh.

02:12.867 --> 02:15.400
Uh... Russell?

02:15.402 --> 02:18.137
I got a lot of
blood at his back.

02:19.272 --> 02:21.440
Could you help me
flip him?

02:24.310 --> 02:26.845
(phillips grunts)

02:26.847 --> 02:28.347
(sighs heavily)

02:29.883 --> 02:31.750
Five sharp-force injuries.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.652
That's a lot of blood,
so he was still alive

02:33.654 --> 02:34.786
When he was stabbed.

02:36.222 --> 02:38.257
This is not an accident.
Grandma may have

02:38.259 --> 02:40.359
Gotten run over
by a reindeer,

02:40.361 --> 02:42.461
But santa got "sleighed."

02:50.603 --> 02:53.338

02:53.340 --> 02:56.575

03:25.471 --> 03:27.339
Sanders:
It's already 50 degrees,

03:27.341 --> 03:29.274
The sun's still rising.

03:29.276 --> 03:31.710
It's supposed to
get up to 70 today.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.379
Say good-bye to the snow.
Sanders:
Our main priority

03:34.381 --> 03:37.449
Is to record and preserve--
analyze everything

03:37.451 --> 03:38.717
When we get back to the lab.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.385
Are we good
for shoe impressions?

03:40.387 --> 03:41.720
Good?

03:41.722 --> 03:43.555
To collect them from the snow.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.424
I'm guessing
you didn't

03:45.426 --> 03:47.526
Process many
cold scenes in l.A.

03:47.528 --> 03:49.828
(laughs) try none.
All right, well,

03:49.830 --> 03:52.397
Heat is usually the battle
here in vegas,

03:52.399 --> 03:53.732
But today it's snow.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.601
Blood doesn't read
the same way,

03:55.603 --> 03:58.704
The drops blend in,
no spines, and prints

03:58.706 --> 04:00.539
Don't lift easily.
Yeah, makes sense.

04:00.541 --> 04:02.507
So we are going to need

04:02.509 --> 04:05.510
Liquid cold wax
to process any impressions,

04:05.512 --> 04:08.380
And dry ice, too.
All right.

04:08.382 --> 04:10.749
I'll call hodges
and have him bring it on over.

04:14.954 --> 04:17.022
Right this way.

04:17.924 --> 04:20.492
Hi. I'm ryan bonham.
Sorry I kept you waiting.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.361
I had to check
on my son blake.

04:22.363 --> 04:24.630
I, uh, just can't
believe all this.
No.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.732
It's a hell of a thing.
Sorry, I'm gonna

04:26.734 --> 04:28.867
Have to ask you
a few questions here.

04:28.869 --> 04:32.371
How well did you know
the victim, mr. Fante?

04:32.373 --> 04:34.339
I didn't know him that well--
I mean, he'd been

04:34.341 --> 04:36.541
With my company for
a few months.

04:36.543 --> 04:38.910
He was all psyched
to organize the christmas party.

04:38.912 --> 04:41.647
Get along with
the other employees?
Oh, yeah.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.649
Brad worked miracles
with computers.

04:43.651 --> 04:44.916
Everyone loved him.

04:44.918 --> 04:47.019
He made a perfect santa.

04:47.021 --> 04:49.888
Is there anything you
can tell me about last night?
Not really, no.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.024
I mean, you know, the
company had a great year,

04:52.026 --> 04:54.359
Everybody was partying,
they were happy.

04:54.361 --> 04:57.296
And then around 9:00, I went
upstairs to put blake to bed.

04:57.298 --> 05:00.565
He's six now. Christmas is a
bit of a tough time for him.

05:00.567 --> 05:02.734
Mm.
For me, too.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.069
My, uh...

05:04.071 --> 05:06.071
My wife died...

05:06.073 --> 05:10.309
Two years ago, christmas eve.

05:10.311 --> 05:11.343
Sorry to hear that.

05:11.345 --> 05:12.978
Yeah.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.746
Uh, anyway, like I said,
I stayed with him,

05:14.748 --> 05:16.915
I fell asleep,
the sirens woke me up,

05:16.917 --> 05:19.451
And I looked out my window...
Yeah, I thought I'd seen

05:19.453 --> 05:21.853
My share of christmas tragedy
in my life, but...

05:23.323 --> 05:26.091
I guess not.

05:26.093 --> 05:29.761
You had a long night,
huh, dash? Yeah.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.396
Bet you're hungry, huh?

05:31.398 --> 05:33.398
That's all right,
we're gonna get you some grub.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.867
Yeah, we'll get you
some food.
Mr. Walt?

05:36.836 --> 05:38.036
Yeah, that's me.

05:38.038 --> 05:40.772
Hey. I'm, uh,
csi sanders.

05:40.774 --> 05:43.508
I'm here to...
Process your reindeer.

05:43.510 --> 05:47.012
Process? You don't
mean put him down?
No, I...

05:47.014 --> 05:50.482
Just need to collect a sample
of blood from his fur.

05:50.484 --> 05:51.950
Why?
Well,

05:51.952 --> 05:53.752
He walked through
a crime scene,

05:53.754 --> 05:56.121
And the blood could
be from our victim

05:56.123 --> 05:58.123
Or even from our killer.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.825
Okay.

06:02.562 --> 06:04.830
(grunting)

06:06.466 --> 06:08.100
It's okay, boy.

06:08.102 --> 06:10.102
It's just a little
cotton on a stick.

06:10.104 --> 06:11.870
Good.
Do you always leave

06:11.872 --> 06:13.772
Your reindeer out at night?
Oh, yeah, yeah,

06:13.774 --> 06:15.941
They like it.
Yeah, what with the snow?

06:15.943 --> 06:17.509
Reminds them of iceland.

06:17.511 --> 06:20.078
Only place in the world
you can find real reindeer.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.012
Yeah, they sleep

06:21.014 --> 06:23.148
By the glaciers.
Hey, you think

06:23.150 --> 06:26.017
Dasher saw who did it?
Um...

06:26.019 --> 06:28.420
It's...
Certainly possible.

06:28.422 --> 06:30.055
You know, I saw
this thing on the news.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.157
They're giving mri's
to dogs now.

06:32.159 --> 06:34.793
Their brains
are a lot like ours.

06:34.795 --> 06:35.994
So old dasher here,

06:35.996 --> 06:37.596
He can't tell us what
he saw, but, you know,

06:37.598 --> 06:40.832
Maybe someday we'll know
what he's thinking.

06:41.868 --> 06:43.502
All right, well, uh...

06:43.504 --> 06:46.671
I think I got what
I need. Thanks.

06:47.974 --> 06:49.908
Hey, dash.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.043
Good boy. That was good.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.845
Yeah.

06:56.649 --> 06:58.450
You got something?

06:58.452 --> 07:00.152
Hodges:
Yeah, partial boot impression.

07:00.154 --> 07:02.154
I checked it against
santa's-- it's not his.

07:02.156 --> 07:03.955
Blood drop inside.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.724
Got blood drops
over here as well.

07:05.726 --> 07:09.094
Man, greg was right.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.630
You can't tell
directionality.
But they are close

07:11.632 --> 07:13.098
To where the body was.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.133
Could be gravitational.
Suggests...

07:15.135 --> 07:17.436
This is the area
where it all happened.

07:17.438 --> 07:20.906
Santa gets stabbed in the back,

07:20.908 --> 07:23.475
<i>Grabs at his wounds,</i>
<i>trying to stop the bleeding,</i>

07:23.477 --> 07:24.876
<i>But the blood is flowing.</i>

07:24.878 --> 07:27.612
<i>Bumps into the sled,</i>
<i>dislodges it.</i>

07:27.614 --> 07:29.714
<i>Sled slides downhill and...</i>

07:29.716 --> 07:31.917
And the elf kingdom weeps.

07:31.919 --> 07:34.653
Time for our
trusty ice wax.

07:35.922 --> 07:37.789
I had to use this
in the infamous

07:37.791 --> 07:39.124
Mount charleston chalet murder.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.992
Death by ski pole.
Long story.

07:40.994 --> 07:43.462
So, how does it
work exactly?

07:43.464 --> 07:45.197
The wax preserves
the impression,

07:45.199 --> 07:47.933
<i>Insulating the snow,</i>
<i>preventing any loss of detail</i>

07:47.935 --> 07:50.101
<i>Caused by heat</i>
<i>from the exothermic reaction</i>

07:50.103 --> 07:52.170
Of the casting material.

07:58.845 --> 08:00.479
And...

08:00.481 --> 08:02.914
Voilà-- frosty cast.

08:02.916 --> 08:05.951
Nice. Um, what about
the blood drops?

08:06.919 --> 08:08.854
You can take them to go.

08:10.590 --> 08:12.491
All right.

08:12.493 --> 08:14.826
Why do you think santa
was hanging out here

08:14.828 --> 08:16.995
All by his lonesome
after the party?

08:16.997 --> 08:19.064
He was probably recovering
from the forced levity

08:19.066 --> 08:20.832
Of a hyper-commercialized
holiday

08:20.834 --> 08:23.134
That's lost
all sense of wonder.
Wow.

08:23.136 --> 08:26.037
Somebody got a lot of coal
in his stocking as a kid.
I wish.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.839
Instead of regaling me
with stories of santa,

08:27.841 --> 08:29.708
My scientist father lectured me

08:29.710 --> 08:31.676
On the implausibility
of the whole thing.

08:31.678 --> 08:34.279
What, he didn't think
a fat man in a sled

08:34.281 --> 08:36.615
Could make it around the world
in one night?

08:36.617 --> 08:39.150
He also had a problem
with the climate damage caused

08:39.152 --> 08:41.019
By toy factories
in the north pole.

08:41.021 --> 08:45.223
God, I hope I don't have
you as my secret santa.
(chuckles)

08:45.225 --> 08:48.126
I can't believe we're actually
doing it again this year.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.608
Must be bonham's kid.

09:03.610 --> 09:05.277
I wonder if he saw anything.

09:05.279 --> 09:07.279
Brody: I don't think
anybody's talked to him yet.

09:07.281 --> 09:10.315
Maybe we should take
a shot at it.

09:10.317 --> 09:12.217
Aren't vaguely dickensian
suburban kids

09:12.219 --> 09:13.718
Russell's department?

09:20.226 --> 09:22.193
(door opens)

09:22.195 --> 09:24.262
Season's greetings,
doctor.

09:24.264 --> 09:26.331
Yeah?
How's it going in here?

09:26.333 --> 09:28.300
Well, our friend
here, mr. Fante,

09:28.302 --> 09:31.736
Is definitely on
someone's naughty list.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.338
Looks like
you got secret santa'd.

09:33.340 --> 09:36.975
Why don't you do
the honors for me, nick.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.176
All right.

09:42.181 --> 09:43.281
(gasps)

09:43.283 --> 09:45.150
Herbal tea.

09:45.152 --> 09:46.318
Mmm.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.086
I think you got russell.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.654
(both chuckle)

09:49.656 --> 09:51.656
I think our victim got

09:51.658 --> 09:54.025
More than a stab
in the back.

09:54.027 --> 09:56.361
He's got a cut on the cheek,
and bruising.

09:56.363 --> 09:57.996
Well, maybe
he was punched

09:57.998 --> 10:00.265
Before he was knifed.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.200
Fiber in the wound.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.836
Stokes: You know,
that almost looks synthetic.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.972
Killer could have
been wearing gloves.

10:10.209 --> 10:12.344
The stabbing was
particularly vicious.

10:12.346 --> 10:15.213
The killer twisted
the blade.

10:15.215 --> 10:18.049
Well, that's the personal touch
right there.

10:18.051 --> 10:19.317
Okay.

10:19.319 --> 10:22.020
Christmas party,
bunch of booze flowing.

10:22.022 --> 10:24.055
Two guys just got in a fight.

10:25.191 --> 10:27.125
I know we got to wait
on tox, but...

10:27.127 --> 10:29.027
Did you find any alcohol
in his stomach?

10:29.029 --> 10:30.795
Nope, just milk
and cookies.

10:30.797 --> 10:33.198
Mr. Clause was a teetotaler.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.300
Okay, there goes
the drunken-brawl theory.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.035
But one thing is for sure.

10:37.037 --> 10:41.973
Jolly st. Nick here
must have pissed somebody off.

11:00.426 --> 11:02.694
Is that your mom?
Uh-huh.

11:02.696 --> 11:04.763
She didn't get
to the end of the story.

11:04.765 --> 11:06.164
Yeah.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.304
Did you watch it with
your daddy last night?

11:13.306 --> 11:15.006
Yeah. He fell asleep.

11:15.008 --> 11:21.246
Well, after your dad went to
sleep, did you happen to see

11:21.248 --> 11:22.981
Or hear anything outside?

11:22.983 --> 11:25.350
I saw the christmas tree lights
go off downtown.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.452
Well, you know, you got
to stay up pretty late.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.788
Do you think maybe you
happened to see anything else?

11:29.790 --> 11:31.322
I saw a reindeer.

11:31.324 --> 11:33.258
I did, too,

11:33.260 --> 11:34.726
Right outside there.

11:34.728 --> 11:36.361
It's pretty awesome, right?

11:36.363 --> 11:38.963
Not that reindeer.
The one in the house.

11:40.099 --> 11:43.001
You saw a reindeer
in the house?

11:43.003 --> 11:44.436
On the staircase.

11:44.438 --> 11:47.005
It had its head down,
pawing at the floor,

11:47.007 --> 11:50.141
So I got scared
and shut my door.

11:50.143 --> 11:54.345
I think, young man,
what you were experiencing

11:54.347 --> 11:57.816
Was a dream, rem sleep.

11:57.818 --> 12:01.119
During rem sleep,
a pretty awesome

Brain chemical called
acetylcholine becomes active,

12:05.058 --> 12:07.892
Subduing other
neurotransmitters.

12:07.894 --> 12:12.330
Now, this excess acetylcholine
is what makes you dream.

12:12.332 --> 12:15.734
So, nothing you saw was real.

12:15.736 --> 12:17.268
Is santa real?

12:17.270 --> 12:19.971
Yes. Yes.

It's from a timberland,

13:11.424 --> 13:13.091

13:13.093 --> 13:14.359

Snow far.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.167
I've been letting it melt

13:22.169 --> 13:24.469
So I could strain the water
for more trace.

13:28.207 --> 13:30.208
Oh.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.377
I don't think I'll need
a strainer for that.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.380
Must have been buried

biological.

Possibly.

show you the workshop for free.

17:41.194 --> 17:43.127

Fante was alive when we left.

18:12.257 --> 18:14.225
So I go the security cam
footage back from r.J.'s diner.

18:32.245 --> 18:35.580
Yeah. New bracelet?

18:35.582 --> 18:37.315

Well, it's why they

Come on. You're dying

That was so generous."

18:43.389 --> 18:45.656

18:45.658 --> 18:47.258
Yes, you do.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.559
No, I don't.

18:48.561 --> 18:50.728
Okay, well,
I'm your secret santa.

18:50.730 --> 18:52.897
And I was planning

18:52.899 --> 18:54.899
On matching your generosity
with something

18:54.901 --> 18:56.834
That I think you would
really like.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.369
Well, I hate
to break your heart,

18:58.371 --> 18:59.370
But I'm not your secret santa.

18:59.372 --> 19:00.571
Really?

19:00.573 --> 19:01.806
Really.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.875
Well, that's unfortunate.

19:03.877 --> 19:06.911
Very unfortunate for you.

19:09.281 --> 19:11.582
Ah. I hate christmas.

Hey. Finn said you
found some mystery tissue

19:15.421 --> 19:18.289

I took from the scene.

19:18.291 --> 19:19.891
Not a mystery anymore.

19:19.893 --> 19:21.392
Is it from our victim?

19:21.394 --> 19:23.361
No. In fact,
it's not even human.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.530
Sarda chiliensis lineolata.

19:25.532 --> 19:26.764
Otherwise known as

19:26.766 --> 19:28.933

Bonito?

19:28.935 --> 19:30.568
Well, they use it in sushi.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.370
Did they serve that
at the party?

19:32.372 --> 19:35.439
Well, if so, it's not the only
thing that they were serving.

19:35.441 --> 19:37.275
I ran tox on the fish guts.

19:37.277 --> 19:38.876
Found traces of cocaine.

19:38.878 --> 19:41.579
We know brad fante organized
the office party.

19:41.581 --> 19:44.315
He went off-script
hiring miss reindeer.

19:44.317 --> 19:46.717
Who knows what else
he had planned for the night.

19:46.719 --> 19:50.288
We know he ordered bonito
with a side of coke.

19:50.290 --> 19:52.590
We know that he tried
to stiff the stripper,

19:52.592 --> 19:54.625
In more ways than one.

19:54.627 --> 19:57.261
Well, if he was cheap
with the stripper,

19:57.263 --> 19:59.463
Maybe he stiffed
his dealer, too.

19:59.465 --> 20:02.433
Then got stiffed.

20:02.435 --> 20:05.870
Stokes: This is brad fante's
little helper, fred larkin.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.538
Not only did he
film the stripper

20:07.540 --> 20:09.473
Doing her reindeer
dance, he also

20:09.475 --> 20:10.775
Taped most of the party.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.643
So, I've been going
through it, hoping

20:12.645 --> 20:15.279
I'd see the killer getting into
some kind of beef with santa.

20:15.281 --> 20:16.447
What did you find?

20:16.449 --> 20:18.482
Oh, typical
christmas party stuff.

20:18.484 --> 20:22.820
A quiet guy singing,
unlikely couple hooking up,

20:22.822 --> 20:24.922
Office joker crying
in his beer.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.591
Anything unexpected?

20:26.593 --> 20:29.961
Yeah. I found two santas.

20:29.963 --> 20:31.996
Take a look at this.

20:31.998 --> 20:33.631
Here's the first thing
I noticed.

20:33.633 --> 20:36.834
Santa pounding a glass of wine.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.803
It's a party. So what?

20:38.805 --> 20:41.439
Well, according to the doc,
he didn't drink alcohol.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.507
Stomach contents were
just milk and cookies.

20:43.509 --> 20:45.376
So, take a look at this.

20:46.311 --> 20:47.645
This is 20 minutes later.

20:47.647 --> 20:49.914
There's our wine-drinking santa,

20:49.916 --> 20:51.849
And it looks like
he gets a phone call.

20:51.851 --> 20:53.851
Now, it must have been pretty
important, because I think

20:53.853 --> 20:55.786
That's when he
ditched the party

20:55.788 --> 20:58.489
And lent his suit
to brad fante,

20:58.491 --> 21:01.459
Who, as we know, had his own
plans for what to do with that.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.894
And how do we know
it's the same suit?
Look right here.

21:04.963 --> 21:06.464
The sleeve.

21:06.466 --> 21:07.732
See the stain?

21:07.734 --> 21:09.867
45 minutes later.

21:09.869 --> 21:13.537
Same suit, different watches,
different beverages...

21:14.740 --> 21:16.374
...Different santas.
Well, it's easy for us

21:16.376 --> 21:18.409
To tell them apart,
because we have this

21:18.411 --> 21:21.345
Video, we have forensics, but...

21:21.347 --> 21:22.747
What if the killer couldn't?

21:22.749 --> 21:24.582
Well, we've run out of suspects

21:24.584 --> 21:26.050
With motives to kill the guy.

21:26.052 --> 21:29.320
Maybe brad fante
was not the target.

21:29.322 --> 21:31.322
No. No, the target...

21:31.324 --> 21:34.392
Was this other santa.

21:35.427 --> 21:38.329
So, who is he?

21:42.367 --> 21:44.568
At winter wonderland, we'll
create a winter wonderland

21:44.570 --> 21:46.304
You'll never forget.

21:46.306 --> 21:49.807
We're your first and last stop
for all your holiday needs.

21:49.809 --> 21:53.511
Hey! We'll even supply you
with real snow,

21:53.513 --> 21:56.480
A live reindeer
and all the trimmings.

21:56.482 --> 22:00.484
Including old st. Nick,
himself-- ho, ho, ho!

22:00.486 --> 22:02.887
So, come on down
to winter wonderland.

22:02.889 --> 22:05.656
And tell 'em jayson sent you.

22:05.658 --> 22:09.827
Neglected to tell us
that "santa" was

22:09.829 --> 22:11.595
Part of the winter
wonderland package.

22:11.597 --> 22:12.863
According to greg,

22:12.865 --> 22:15.566
He passed himself off
as just an employee.

22:15.568 --> 22:17.401
Looks like he owns the company.
That still doesn't tell us

22:17.403 --> 22:19.870
Why someone tried
to kill him, though.

22:19.872 --> 22:21.439
I might be able
to help with that.

22:21.441 --> 22:22.707
What do you got?
Well, you know

22:22.709 --> 22:25.443
The cocaine-laced bonito
we found in the snow

22:25.445 --> 22:27.345
At ryan bonham's yard?

22:27.347 --> 22:28.746
Well, it turns out that

22:28.748 --> 22:30.481
Bonito wasn't
served at the party.

22:30.483 --> 22:31.849
So how'd it
get there?

22:31.851 --> 22:34.118
It was already in the ice.

22:35.053 --> 22:36.087
How does that work?

22:36.089 --> 22:37.688
Well, I ran the
truck manifest.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.557
When it's not working
holiday parties,

22:39.559 --> 22:42.993
It makes a lot of trips
from mexico to vegas,

22:42.995 --> 22:45.529
Transporting
pacific bonito--

22:45.531 --> 22:46.697
On ice.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.766
<i>Bonito stuffed with cocaine.</i>

22:51.370 --> 22:54.538
<i>Which is how remnants</i>
<i>of bonito and coke</i>

22:54.540 --> 22:55.906
<i>Got mixed in with ice.</i>

22:55.908 --> 22:59.910
<i>The same ice used</i>
<i>to make the snow.</i>

22:59.912 --> 23:02.380
Jayson walt thought
he was providing

23:02.382 --> 23:03.814
A little snow for christmas.

23:03.816 --> 23:05.516
What he
didn't realize

23:05.518 --> 23:08.753
Is that he was adding
a little powder to the powder.

23:08.755 --> 23:10.755
Well, that gives us motive
for someone to try to kill him.

23:10.757 --> 23:13.124
Guy's a major
drug runner.

23:13.126 --> 23:14.759
Could've been working
with cartels in mexico.

23:14.761 --> 23:16.894
That's one bad santa.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.462
That's one <i>dead</i> santa,

23:18.464 --> 23:21.432
If we don't bring him in
before the killer finds him.

23:25.505 --> 23:28.973
I know it's a busy time
of year for you.

23:28.975 --> 23:31.175
Lvpd interested
in a white christmas party?

23:31.177 --> 23:32.443
No.

23:32.445 --> 23:34.044
I'm interested in a dead santa

23:34.046 --> 23:36.647
That was found
in ryan bonham's lawn.

23:36.649 --> 23:39.650
Now, up to 9:33, you
were the guy in the
red suit playing santa.

23:39.652 --> 23:40.785
You didn't tell us that.

23:40.787 --> 23:43.087
Nobody asked.
Look, pal,

23:43.089 --> 23:45.623
Whoever killed the guy
in the suit was after you.

23:45.625 --> 23:48.459
No way. Why would
anyone want to kill me?

23:48.461 --> 23:49.827
I don't know, maybe
'cause you're running drugs

23:49.829 --> 23:51.429
From mexico in your ice truck.

23:51.431 --> 23:53.898
Yeah, we found
fish guts laced
with cocaine

23:53.900 --> 23:56.634
On ryan bonham's lawn.

23:56.636 --> 24:00.938
This is the part
of the interview where
you help us help you.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.039
Oh, yeah. How's that?

24:02.041 --> 24:03.607
Well, in your
line of business--

24:03.609 --> 24:05.609
And I'm not talking about
spreading holiday cheer

24:05.611 --> 24:08.179
By putting fake snow on
lawns-- I'm talking about

24:08.181 --> 24:11.515
The other kind of cheer
with the other kind of snow.

24:11.517 --> 24:13.951
Now, obviously,
you've made enemies.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.753
You tell us who they
are, we'll help you

24:15.755 --> 24:17.188
Broker a deal with the dea.

24:17.190 --> 24:20.124
And what if I don't
want to you help me?

24:20.126 --> 24:22.193
Well, then it's a
quick trip upstate.

24:22.195 --> 24:23.661
And the inmates
up there have

24:23.663 --> 24:25.663
Absolutely no
goodwill toward men.

24:25.665 --> 24:27.198
Yeah, I think
I'll take my chances.

24:27.200 --> 24:29.500
I'm trying to
save your life.

24:29.502 --> 24:31.001
Yeah, or maybe you're
trying to work an angle.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.570
Wouldn't be
the first party

24:32.572 --> 24:34.138
To have sushi
and coke delivered.

24:34.140 --> 24:35.706
Plus, I don't buy
that you got evidence

24:35.708 --> 24:37.007
That I'm the delivery boy.

24:37.009 --> 24:38.876
So, if we're
through here,

24:38.878 --> 24:41.779
I'm late for my next santa gig.

24:41.781 --> 24:43.180
Sit down,
kringle.

24:43.182 --> 24:45.850
Sit back down!

24:45.852 --> 24:47.017
We have evidence.

24:47.019 --> 24:48.853
We have your snow.
We have your product.

24:48.855 --> 24:51.522
Someone's gonna
read you your rights.

24:51.524 --> 24:53.224
You're under arrest.

24:53.226 --> 24:54.658
Process him.

25:04.703 --> 25:05.736
Nail polish?

25:05.738 --> 25:07.771
"for your mistletoes."

25:07.773 --> 25:09.173
Cute.

25:09.175 --> 25:10.241
I like.

25:10.243 --> 25:11.775
Total chick gift.

25:11.777 --> 25:13.244
I bet finn's your secret santa.

25:13.246 --> 25:16.914
Or maybe it's you,
trying to cleverly trick me.

25:16.916 --> 25:19.717
Well, I guess we'll just have
to wait for the office party,

25:19.719 --> 25:20.918
And all will be revealed.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.520
In the meantime...

25:22.522 --> 25:23.821
Check this out, I just got

25:23.823 --> 25:26.790
Jayson walt's phone records.
For the last week,

25:26.792 --> 25:30.194
He has been in touch with
someone at ely prison.

25:30.196 --> 25:32.129
What, making reservations?
No.

25:32.131 --> 25:33.831
Texting and talking

25:33.833 --> 25:36.200
With his convict
older brother, gary lee walt.

25:36.202 --> 25:37.568
What's gary in for?

25:37.570 --> 25:42.206
So maybe the little brother
is holding the family business

25:42.208 --> 25:44.008
Together while
big brother's inside.

25:44.010 --> 25:45.709
That's what I thought,

25:45.711 --> 25:49.146
Until I looked at gary
lee's trial transcript.

25:49.148 --> 25:52.550
Last year, jayson walt
turned state's evidence

25:52.552 --> 25:55.853
Well, he was probably just
trying to save his own ass.

25:55.855 --> 25:59.657
And his own piece
of the drug trafficking pie.

25:59.659 --> 26:01.892
So, why do you think
they're talking now?

26:01.894 --> 26:03.794
Gary lee just
won an appeal.

26:03.796 --> 26:05.796
He has a hearing
scheduled.

26:05.798 --> 26:08.799
How much you want to bet older
brother's gonna try and convince

26:08.801 --> 26:10.067
Younger brother
to change his story?

26:10.069 --> 26:11.068
Yeah.

26:11.070 --> 26:13.137
With a little
cash incentive.

26:13.139 --> 26:14.838
Take a look at this
last communication.

26:14.840 --> 26:17.608
"jayson: Make it 200."

26:17.610 --> 26:19.076
"gary lee: Can't."

26:19.078 --> 26:20.911
"jayson: No deal, bro."

26:20.913 --> 26:24.248
Brotherly love.
Two days after this exchange,

26:24.250 --> 26:26.283
Brad fante was
knifed in the back,

26:26.285 --> 26:29.219
Just after jayson loaned
him his santa suit.

26:29.221 --> 26:32.790
So, big brother
tries to cut a kringle.

26:32.792 --> 26:36.694
I think it's time
for us to make a trip to ely.

26:36.696 --> 26:38.629
Well, we don't even
have to go that far.

26:38.631 --> 26:41.265
Gary lee was just admitted
to desert palm hospital.

26:41.267 --> 26:43.300
Kidney failure.

26:45.737 --> 26:47.338
Nick:
Mr. Walt.

26:47.340 --> 26:50.107
I'm csi stokes.

26:50.109 --> 26:53.344
With the lvpd.
I'm here to ask
you a few questions

26:53.346 --> 26:54.812
About your brother, jayson.

26:54.814 --> 26:56.947
What about him?

26:56.949 --> 26:58.949
Well, it seems
like somebody's
trying to kill him.

26:58.951 --> 27:00.651
It's not surprising.

27:00.653 --> 27:03.087
My little brother has
a way of pissing people off.

27:03.089 --> 27:05.789
Like you.
Seems like you'd get

27:05.791 --> 27:07.791
Pissed off
pretty easily.

27:07.793 --> 27:10.160
Course, I wouldn't
blame you, after what
he did to you last year--

27:10.162 --> 27:12.630
Turning his back
on you like that.

27:12.632 --> 27:14.765
Jayson was just
a scared little kid.

27:14.767 --> 27:16.734
Lied.

27:16.736 --> 27:18.102
He's gonna come clean, now.

27:18.104 --> 27:20.871
Really? I don't know, it
doesn't seem like you two

27:20.873 --> 27:23.140
Kiss and make
up that easy.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.174
What tells you that?

27:24.176 --> 27:25.275
Pictures.

27:25.277 --> 27:27.878
I think your hit man
made a mistake.

27:27.880 --> 27:30.681
That's supposed to be
your brother, isn't it?

27:30.683 --> 27:32.850
I think you're the one
who's making the mistake.

27:32.852 --> 27:35.285
'cause jayson is
the last person in the world

27:35.287 --> 27:36.787
I would want to kill.

27:36.789 --> 27:38.922
Because he's gonna deliver

27:38.924 --> 27:41.859
The greatest
christmas present ever.

27:41.861 --> 27:43.827
He's gonna give me
my life back.

27:43.829 --> 27:46.930
In court and right here,
in the hospital.

27:46.932 --> 27:49.900
'cause, you see, we've got

27:49.902 --> 27:54.772
Perfect matching
leukocyte antigens.

27:54.774 --> 27:56.807
Jayson's gonna be
your kidney donor.

27:56.809 --> 27:58.942
Real proud of my little bro.

27:58.944 --> 28:01.078
He's stepping up. Family.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.881
Yeah, family.
You know, I've read your texts.

28:03.883 --> 28:06.316
I know you two were
haggling over money, and I
know you were paying him.

28:06.318 --> 28:09.920
Well... We all need
a little incentive.

28:09.922 --> 28:12.956
Yeah, but he wasn't happy with
what you were offering.

28:12.958 --> 28:16.293
And now,
unfortunately for you,

28:16.295 --> 28:17.995
I don't think he's
gonna be available.

28:19.130 --> 28:22.032
Sorry.

28:24.436 --> 28:25.869
News flash.

28:27.906 --> 28:30.140
Jayson and I
arrived at a number.

28:30.142 --> 28:32.943
And we came
to an understanding.

28:32.945 --> 28:35.279
Including a little advance.

28:35.281 --> 28:36.780
For his bail.

28:36.782 --> 28:37.881
His bail.

28:37.883 --> 28:38.882
That's right.

28:38.884 --> 28:40.751
He's getting out just about now.

28:40.753 --> 28:44.088
Tomorrow he'll be in here
saving my sorry ass.

28:44.090 --> 28:46.924
Week after that,
he'll be recanting.

28:46.926 --> 28:48.826
Then I'm going to have

28:48.828 --> 28:51.795
The merriest christmas
vegas has ever seen.

28:54.499 --> 28:56.233
Ho, ho, ho.

28:56.235 --> 28:57.501
Russell:
<i>So the guy we thought</i>

28:57.503 --> 29:00.003
Had the best motive
for killing jayson walt

29:00.005 --> 29:01.739
Is actually the guy

29:01.741 --> 29:04.174
Who has the least desire
to see any harm come to him.

29:04.176 --> 29:05.342
Yeah, without
his brother's kidney,

29:05.344 --> 29:07.077
Gary lee's a dead man.

29:10.849 --> 29:12.049
What are you thinking?

29:12.051 --> 29:13.383
You got anything?

29:13.385 --> 29:14.952
The autopsy.

29:14.954 --> 29:18.989
<i>Stabbed the victim</i>
<i>and then twisted that knife.</i>

29:18.991 --> 29:20.958
Right. We thought
it was personal.
Okay,

29:20.960 --> 29:22.826
What if it was
more than just personal?

29:22.828 --> 29:24.328
I mean, given
the fact that

29:24.330 --> 29:26.463
Gary lee needs a
kidney so desperately,

29:26.465 --> 29:29.433
What if their total destruction
was the killer's intent?

29:29.435 --> 29:30.467
You know
what I mean?

29:30.469 --> 29:32.536
You destroy
jayson walt's kidneys,

29:32.538 --> 29:34.872
You're in effect
killing gary lee walt.

29:34.874 --> 29:36.440
Murder by proxy.

29:36.442 --> 29:39.843
So, our question is
who wants gary lee walt dead?

29:39.845 --> 29:44.081
I give you gary lee walt's
greatest hits.

29:44.083 --> 29:45.048
Allegedly.

29:45.050 --> 29:46.917
These are all
drug related kills

29:46.919 --> 29:48.452
That he is suspected
of ordering.

29:48.454 --> 29:52.489
Sanders:
Mala noche's...
Mad-10's... Aquila cartel.

29:52.491 --> 29:53.924
Anyone of
them could've
ordered the hit.

29:53.926 --> 29:55.058
Yeah, that's what I thought.

29:55.060 --> 29:58.061
Until I came to
this crime scene.

29:58.063 --> 30:01.398
Ryan bonham's wife, eva.

30:01.400 --> 30:05.169
He told us that she died two
years ago on christmas eve.

30:05.171 --> 30:07.070
This is how.

30:07.072 --> 30:10.040
Eva bonham worked
at a savings & loan.

30:10.042 --> 30:11.508
Finlay:
Yes. Gary lee walt

30:11.510 --> 30:14.344
Was laundering
his drug money at that bank.

30:14.346 --> 30:17.548
An executive found out,
was about to go to the police.

30:17.550 --> 30:19.416
But gary lee walt
got to him first.

30:19.418 --> 30:22.152
Eva bonham was
working late that night

30:22.154 --> 30:24.087
And became collateral damage.

30:24.089 --> 30:25.556
Sanders:
Leaving behind a husband

30:25.558 --> 30:27.891
To care for their
little boy alone.

30:27.893 --> 30:30.928
So, ryan bonham has been
in touch with the da all along.

30:30.930 --> 30:32.229
He knew about the appeal.

30:32.231 --> 30:35.065
He also knew that
it had to be rescheduled

30:35.067 --> 30:36.900
Because of gary lee walt's
surgery.

30:36.902 --> 30:38.268
And he must have
known that jayson walt

30:38.270 --> 30:40.137
Was going to give his
brother his kidney.

30:40.139 --> 30:43.307
And he couldn't stand to
see gary lee walt saved.

30:43.309 --> 30:44.575
Can't say I blame him.

30:44.577 --> 30:48.345
So ryan hires jayson walt
to work his party.

30:48.347 --> 30:52.416
<i>He wants to get him alone,</i>
<i>on his turf...</i>

30:52.418 --> 30:54.151
(grunting)

30:57.055 --> 30:58.222
...Except it's the wrong santa.

30:58.224 --> 30:59.289
Brad.

30:59.291 --> 31:00.123
Ryan....?!

31:04.963 --> 31:06.330
(screaming)

31:06.332 --> 31:07.497
Finlay:
<i>Ryan panics.</i>

31:07.499 --> 31:09.366
<i>Can't believe</i>
<i>what he's done.</i>

31:09.368 --> 31:11.435
<i>Goes inside and gets</i>
<i>rid of the evidence.</i>

31:11.437 --> 31:14.004
He runs back upstairs
to be with his kid,

31:14.006 --> 31:16.206
Wishing he could
will it all away.

31:16.208 --> 31:17.207
Me, too.

31:17.209 --> 31:18.909
'cause now, that kid's

31:18.911 --> 31:21.044
Going to lose
both his parents.

31:21.046 --> 31:23.647
(sirens wailing)

31:23.649 --> 31:26.250
(tires screech, sirens stop)

31:33.091 --> 31:34.291
Las vegas police!

31:34.293 --> 31:36.193
Ryan bonham!

31:36.195 --> 31:38.161
Go, go, go.

31:42.300 --> 31:44.935
(distant thumping)

32:00.251 --> 32:02.252
Whew...

32:02.254 --> 32:03.387
Blake.

32:03.389 --> 32:06.023
It's okay.

32:06.025 --> 32:08.158
You're safe, son.
I'm a policeman.

32:08.160 --> 32:09.526
Some men came.

32:09.528 --> 32:11.161
They took my daddy.

32:16.668 --> 32:19.002
Stokes:
<i>I heard ryan bonham's missing.</i>
<i>What the hell happened to him?</i>

32:19.004 --> 32:21.305
Yeah, some guys broke in.
They trashed the place.

32:21.307 --> 32:25.509
When the fake santa, jayson
walt, made bail, he disappeared.

32:25.511 --> 32:27.177
Bet he figured out
ryan tried to kill him?

32:27.179 --> 32:28.946
That's a safe bet.
And what
about the kid,

32:28.948 --> 32:30.314
Blake?

32:30.316 --> 32:32.983
Well, you know, he's okay.
He's a little shaken up.

32:32.985 --> 32:34.518
Yeah? Did he see anything?
I don't know.

32:34.520 --> 32:36.453
He'll only talk to one person.

32:36.455 --> 32:38.255
Who?

32:38.257 --> 32:39.589
Me?!

32:39.591 --> 32:40.691
(scoffs)

32:40.693 --> 32:42.326
Last time I saw him,
I scared him.

32:42.328 --> 32:43.994
He said he wanted
to talk to--

32:43.996 --> 32:46.964
And I quote--
"the funny science man."

32:46.966 --> 32:49.266
A compliment, I suppose, but...

32:49.268 --> 32:51.268
You got to help me out here.

32:51.270 --> 32:53.303
Just relax. Engage him. Here.

32:53.305 --> 32:55.305
Give him this.
Chocolate.

32:55.307 --> 32:56.440
Get him talking.

32:56.442 --> 32:58.141
I'm sure he saw something.

32:58.143 --> 33:00.344
This is a bad idea.
I'm gonna screw this up.

33:00.346 --> 33:02.746
Just, you know,
give it your best shot.

33:02.748 --> 33:05.415
(sighs)

33:23.568 --> 33:25.402
(sighs)

33:27.171 --> 33:29.106
Hey... Little man.

33:29.108 --> 33:30.407
Hi.

33:35.513 --> 33:37.381
Sorry. I'm allergic.

33:37.383 --> 33:40.050
Yeah. Me, too.

33:43.254 --> 33:45.255
I like your watch.

33:45.257 --> 33:47.290
I used to have one
just like it.

33:47.292 --> 33:49.359
It's purple.
Good color.

33:49.361 --> 33:51.194
And the diode display.

33:51.196 --> 33:52.396
Groundbreaking technology

33:52.398 --> 33:54.431
For its day.

33:54.433 --> 33:57.034
Not that you...

33:57.036 --> 33:58.301
You're a science man,

33:58.303 --> 33:59.403
Right?

33:59.405 --> 34:00.704
You know big words.

34:00.706 --> 34:04.508
Sure. I-I know
some big words.

34:04.510 --> 34:08.045
Did the people with your daddy
use big words?

34:08.047 --> 34:10.580
Uh-huh. "condestorb."

34:10.582 --> 34:13.617
"condestorb"?
When they were going,

34:13.619 --> 34:15.285
One man yelled
at the other man.

34:15.287 --> 34:19.356
He was mad because he hadn't
gotten his condestorb fixed.

34:19.358 --> 34:21.625
Do you mean "condenser"?

34:21.627 --> 34:23.693
Yeah! What is that?

34:23.695 --> 34:26.396
It's a machine
that helps freeze things.

34:28.232 --> 34:30.467
Did you see the truck
the men came in, blake?

34:30.469 --> 34:32.169
Yeah, when they drove up.

34:32.171 --> 34:33.770
When my dad told me to hide.

34:33.772 --> 34:36.506
And was it the same truck that
was at the party at your house?

34:36.508 --> 34:38.475
Uh-huh.

34:38.477 --> 34:41.111
Will my daddy be okay?

34:43.347 --> 34:45.515
As long as he knows
what a great,

34:45.517 --> 34:47.551
Smart son he has,

34:47.553 --> 34:49.352
He's gonna be just fine.

34:49.354 --> 34:51.321
He's a very lucky daddy.

34:51.323 --> 34:53.723
Thanks.

34:54.692 --> 34:56.359
Traffic cam

34:56.361 --> 34:58.361
Caught jayson walt's
ice truck turning off

34:58.363 --> 35:00.630
I-15 onto 215 east

35:00.632 --> 35:03.533
One hour ago.
I'm guessing
that ryan bonham is

35:03.535 --> 35:06.403
In the back, on ice, and
they're taking him out of town.

35:06.405 --> 35:08.538
Yeah, but I don't get it.
Why didn't they just
kill him at the house?

35:08.540 --> 35:10.574
Maybe ryan has something
they want.

35:10.576 --> 35:13.443
So, where do you think
they're going?

35:13.445 --> 35:15.645
My guess is someplace isolated,

35:15.647 --> 35:19.282
Where they feel safe...
So they can rough him up.

35:19.284 --> 35:21.418
Maybe...

35:21.420 --> 35:23.520
Where they make
their ice.

35:23.522 --> 35:25.288
Why do you say that?

35:25.290 --> 35:28.291
Because when I analyzed
the melted snow,

35:28.293 --> 35:30.360
There was no chlorine
in the water.

35:30.362 --> 35:33.763
And all of las vegas'
tap water adds chlorine.

35:33.765 --> 35:36.366
If I test the diatoms
in the melted snow,

35:36.368 --> 35:39.503
I might be able to...
Pinpoint the water source.

35:39.505 --> 35:41.771
Give us a location.

35:41.773 --> 35:43.840
♪

36:13.671 --> 36:15.372
Hey.

36:15.374 --> 36:18.375
So, that party snow came
from a small lake

36:18.377 --> 36:19.609
Near henderson.
So that's
where the truck's going.

36:19.611 --> 36:21.778
Yeah, I ran property records
in henderson.

36:21.780 --> 36:23.580
Turns out the walt brothers

36:23.582 --> 36:25.715
Have had a warehouse there
since the early '90s.

36:25.717 --> 36:28.518
Good work, greg.
Well, I hope
it's not too late.

36:31.789 --> 36:34.925
Jayson:
Where's the box of bank records?

36:34.927 --> 36:37.460
(grunting)

36:41.566 --> 36:43.633
Stop it.
Please stop! Stop.

36:43.635 --> 36:45.402
I'll show you where it is.

36:45.404 --> 36:46.636
No, you're gonna tell me
where to find it!

36:46.638 --> 36:48.238
I can't tell you
where to find it!

36:48.240 --> 36:49.873
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
Hey, hey!

36:49.875 --> 36:54.711
What? What are you t...
Aw, it doesn't
matter anyway. Go on.

36:54.713 --> 36:56.913
Power it up!

36:56.915 --> 36:58.949
You know,
cops said someone

36:58.951 --> 37:02.252
Was trying to kill me--
santa stabbed in the back.

37:02.254 --> 37:03.453
At your house.

37:03.455 --> 37:05.222
Pretty easy to figure out!

37:05.224 --> 37:08.525
You know, the thing about
this ice chipper, see,

37:08.527 --> 37:11.962
Lot of times, once you get
something in there,

37:11.964 --> 37:13.797
No turning back, ryan!

37:13.799 --> 37:15.899
Hey! You listening
to me? Huh?

37:15.901 --> 37:17.500
Last chance, ryan!

37:17.502 --> 37:19.536
I'm tired of waiting.

37:21.572 --> 37:24.541
All right, if that's
how you want it!

37:27.578 --> 37:29.412
No...!

37:29.414 --> 37:31.815
Las vegas police!
Put down your weapons!

37:34.352 --> 37:37.020
Back off or I put a bullet
in his head!

37:37.022 --> 37:38.922
Put the gun down, jayson.

37:38.924 --> 37:41.024
I will do it!
Well, so will I.

37:41.026 --> 37:43.526
I'll bust a cap
right in your kidneys.

37:43.528 --> 37:44.694
I'll kill you

37:44.696 --> 37:46.529
And your brother.

37:46.531 --> 37:47.564
Put the gun down.

37:50.534 --> 37:51.568
Shoot him!

37:52.903 --> 37:54.304
They killed my wife!

37:54.939 --> 37:55.905
Do it!

37:55.907 --> 37:57.774
Put the gun down, jayson.

38:03.281 --> 38:04.781
(gun clatters)

38:05.983 --> 38:07.684
(groans)

38:19.030 --> 38:21.531
You should've killed him.

38:21.533 --> 38:23.933
Ryan bonham,
you're under arrest.

38:23.935 --> 38:25.468
Get him out of here.

38:43.621 --> 38:46.389
He made a full confession.

38:46.391 --> 38:49.025
He admitted to killing
brad fante by mistake.

38:49.027 --> 38:51.394
He's lucky jayson walt
didn't kill him.

38:51.396 --> 38:53.029
He saw them coming.
He told his kid to hide.

38:53.031 --> 38:55.999
Then when they busted in, he
somehow convinced jayson walt

38:56.001 --> 38:57.667
That his wife had bank records

38:57.669 --> 38:59.803
That would incriminate both him
and his brother.

38:59.805 --> 39:01.538
There were no records.

39:01.540 --> 39:03.473
Buying time.

39:03.475 --> 39:05.875
Till we could find his kid.
Well...

39:05.877 --> 39:08.978
Losing your wife like that...

39:10.815 --> 39:12.682
Anyway...

39:12.684 --> 39:15.752
Oh, there's been a little mix-up
in jayson walt's custody.

39:15.754 --> 39:18.621
A henderson, nevada,
sheriff showed up--

39:18.623 --> 39:19.756
He's a friend--

39:19.758 --> 39:22.359
And I handed jayson walt
over to him.

39:22.361 --> 39:25.495
The weird thing is that his
wristband number got transposed.

39:25.497 --> 39:26.796
He got on the wrong bus.

39:26.798 --> 39:28.631
Where is he now?

39:28.633 --> 39:30.433
He's shuffling off to buffalo.

39:30.435 --> 39:32.602
Unbelievable, isn't it?
The red tape.

39:32.604 --> 39:35.372
Could take months for him
to get back to las vegas.

39:35.374 --> 39:36.840
Well, I guess he won't be

39:36.842 --> 39:39.476
Giving his brother
his kidney tomorrow, will he?

39:39.478 --> 39:42.645
It's tragic, isn't it?

39:42.647 --> 39:44.647
So, there are some people

39:44.649 --> 39:46.649
Who will be here soon,
very nice people,

39:46.651 --> 39:50.520
And, um, they're going to take
you to see your grandparents,

39:50.522 --> 39:52.055
Okay?
Okay.

39:54.759 --> 39:58.628
You know, blake, um,
this thing with you father,

39:58.630 --> 40:00.764
I'm sure it's hard for
you to understand.

40:00.766 --> 40:02.165
He misses my mom.

40:02.167 --> 40:04.167
I'm sure he does.

40:04.169 --> 40:06.536
I do, too.

40:06.538 --> 40:09.139
