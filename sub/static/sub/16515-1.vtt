00:25.570 --> 00:27.368
BE VERY SCARED.

00:27.572 --> 00:29.324
IT'S A DIFFICULT DECISION.

00:33.995 --> 00:35.247
YOU'VE BLOODY WELL DONE IT AGAIN.

00:35.455 --> 00:36.752
I WAS KEEPING HIM OUT, YOU IDIOT.

00:36.957 --> 00:38.459
ONE IS ALLOWED TO MAKE
A MISTAKE ON OCCASION.

00:38.667 --> 00:41.045
ONE IS NOT. ONE IS SUPPOSED
TO STOP BLOODY JUSTIN

00:41.253 --> 00:42.675
RUINING US AGAIN.

00:42.879 --> 00:45.177
GENTLEMEN, WHAT HAPPENED TO FAIR PLAY?

00:45.382 --> 00:47.100
IT DIED THE DAY YOU WERE BORN.

00:49.886 --> 00:52.184
LAST DOMINO.

00:52.389 --> 00:53.811
SPAWN OF THE DEVIL.

00:59.980 --> 01:01.277
I CAN'T GO!

01:01.481 --> 01:02.607
THAT MUST BE UNCOMFORTABLE.

01:05.527 --> 01:07.780
I SUPPOSE I BETTER, THEN.

01:09.489 --> 01:11.958
COME ON, COME ON, PAY UP.

01:12.158 --> 01:14.286
TO THEM THAT HATH SHALL BE GIVEN.

01:14.494 --> 01:16.747
THERE YOU ARE, BLOATED CAPITALIST PIG.

01:16.955 --> 01:18.798
DON'T HATE THE PLAYER, HATE THE GAME.

01:18.999 --> 01:20.672
NO, NO, I LIKE THE GAME.

01:23.003 --> 01:24.300
DRINKS, ANYONE?

01:24.504 --> 01:26.472
WHILST YOU'RE UP, CHRIS.

01:26.673 --> 01:29.552
GUYS, SORRY, THERE'S A BIT OF A GLITCH.

01:29.759 --> 01:33.104
RUN OUT OF BEER?

01:33.305 --> 01:35.148
YES.

01:35.348 --> 01:36.520
A PUMP WITHOUT BEER,

01:36.725 --> 01:39.353
NOW THERE'S AN INTERESTING CONCEPT.

01:39.561 --> 01:41.279
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

01:41.479 --> 01:42.776
IT'S FINE, IT'S JUST ANOTHER
COCK-UP WITH THE DELIVERY.

01:42.981 --> 01:45.075
- WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.
- DON'T WORRY.

01:45.275 --> 01:46.993
I'M FEELING FLUSH. LET'S HAVE A BOTTLE

01:47.193 --> 01:48.319
OF THEIR SECOND CHEAPEST CLARET.

01:48.528 --> 01:50.701
I WANT BEER.

01:50.905 --> 01:52.623
MY MOTHER ALWAYS SAYS I WANT AND NEVER GET.

01:52.824 --> 01:53.996
EXACTLY.

01:54.200 --> 01:55.577
WE'LL HAVE SOME CASHEWS, AS WELL, PLEASE.

01:55.785 --> 01:57.537
OH, IN THAT CASE, YES.

01:57.746 --> 01:58.747
YOU TO ME.

02:07.922 --> 02:09.014
GOOD NIGHT?

02:09.215 --> 02:10.592
THEY RAN OUT OF BEER.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.302
HOW AWFUL.

02:12.510 --> 02:14.558
SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

02:14.763 --> 02:16.060
DID YOU WIN?

02:16.264 --> 02:18.608
98 PENCE DOWN.

02:18.808 --> 02:20.435
POOR DARLING. IS IT JUSTIN AGAIN?

02:20.644 --> 02:22.362
I'VE WORKED OUT WHAT IT IS.

02:22.562 --> 02:25.315
WHEN HE GOES HOME FIRST AND HAS
A LITTLE SLURP WITH SUPPER,

02:25.523 --> 02:26.991
HE'S EASY MEAT.

02:27.192 --> 02:29.240
WHEN HE COMES STRAIGHT ON FROM SCHOOL,

02:29.444 --> 02:30.570
HE'S LIKE THE DOMINOES EQUIVALENT

02:30.779 --> 02:32.656
OF STEPHEN HAWKING.

02:32.864 --> 02:35.492
WHAT ARE YOU READING?

02:35.700 --> 02:37.828
OH, DEAR.

02:38.036 --> 02:39.538
OH, DEAR, WHAT?

02:39.746 --> 02:42.169
AFTER RETURNING FROM A HORRID DAY IN COURT,

02:42.374 --> 02:44.172
I HAD THE PLEASURE OF SCRAPING DOG POO

02:44.376 --> 02:46.470
OFF CHARLIES FOOTBALL
BOOTS WITH A TOOTHBRUSH

02:46.670 --> 02:47.671
THAT I HOPE I'VE THROWN AWAY.

02:47.879 --> 02:49.131
THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY A RUGBY MATCH

02:49.339 --> 02:50.682
MASQUERADING AS DINNER,

02:50.882 --> 02:52.930
THEN THE EXISTENTIAL HELL
OF BATH AND BEDTIME.

02:53.134 --> 02:56.388
YOU HAVE YOUR DOMINOES.
THIS IS MY RELAXATION.

02:56.596 --> 02:58.189
- SORRY.
- YES.

03:02.560 --> 03:05.860
OH! OH, GEOFFREY!

03:06.064 --> 03:08.567
IT'S BAD ENOUGH US STOCKING
THE WRETCHED BOOK,

03:08.775 --> 03:10.743
YOU DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE
TO READ IT, AS WELL.

03:10.944 --> 03:12.537
YOU'LL GET HIGH ON YOUR OWN SUPPLY.

03:12.737 --> 03:15.741
IT'S RESEARCH.

03:15.949 --> 03:18.293
TEN PAGES IS ALL I MANAGED.

03:19.994 --> 03:21.667
HOW MANY COPIES OF THE NEW ZADIE SMITH

03:21.871 --> 03:24.545
- DID WE SELL LAST WEEK?
- FOUR.

03:24.749 --> 03:28.845
- AND OF "SHE CAME IN CHAINS"?
- FIFTY-THREE.

03:29.003 --> 03:30.755
INCLUDING ONE TO LADY FERMLEY-CADWALLER.

03:30.964 --> 03:31.931
WHO SAID IT WAS FOR HER GRANDDAUGHTER,

03:32.132 --> 03:33.759
WHEN SHE WAS CLEARLY LYING.

03:33.967 --> 03:36.265
CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOUR FIGURES, DARLING.

03:36.469 --> 03:39.769
NOPE, BUT I CAN ARGUE
WITH ITS COMPLETE LACK

03:39.973 --> 03:41.395
OF LITERARY MERIT.

03:41.599 --> 03:42.942
WHICH, OF COURSE, I CONCEDE.

03:43.143 --> 03:46.238
AND I CAN ARGUE IN ITS DEPICTION

03:46.438 --> 03:50.159
OF ALL WOMEN AS NEEDING DOMINATED.

03:50.358 --> 03:52.781
DOESN'T STOP ME READING IT, NOW DOES IT?

03:52.986 --> 03:54.659
DIDN'T STOP ME FROM READING
"LADY CHATTERLEY."

03:54.863 --> 03:56.865
YEAH, BUT THAT WAS GREAT LITERATURE.

03:57.073 --> 03:58.916
- WAS IT?
- YES.

03:59.117 --> 04:04.590
THE ACT OF CARNALITY AS AN
EXPLOSION OF SENSUALITY,

04:04.789 --> 04:06.041
EXPRESSION OF NEW WISDOM

04:06.249 --> 04:08.923
IN THE ULTIMATE LIFE AND LOVE EXPERIENCE.

04:09.127 --> 04:12.051
IT WAS ABOUT HAVING SEX IN A SHED.

04:12.255 --> 04:14.303
WAS IT MILLER WHO SAID

04:14.507 --> 04:16.475
"IT'S ALL THIS COLD-HEARTED
FUCKING, THAT IS DEATH AND IDIOCY"?

04:16.676 --> 04:18.349
SEE, THAT'S WHAT'S SO DESPICABLE,

04:18.553 --> 04:21.557
- IS THE COLD-HEARTED...
- STOP PONTIFICATING.

04:21.765 --> 04:23.984
READ YOUR HOLLINGHURST. DON'T STRESS.

04:29.689 --> 04:34.741
VERY CHILDISH. VERY, VERY CHILDISH.

04:38.156 --> 04:39.703
DO YOU REALLY GET ANY PLEASURE

04:39.908 --> 04:43.128
OUT OF READING THAT ILL-FORMED GARBAGE?

04:43.328 --> 04:46.377
PLEASURE? LET ME THINK.

04:46.581 --> 04:48.458
DO YOU MEAN AM I GOING
TO LEAP ON YOU TONIGHT

04:48.666 --> 04:50.668
DEMANDING THAT YOU HAVE
YOUR WICKED WAY WITH ME?

04:50.877 --> 04:52.595
HMM. HIGHLY UNLIKELY.

04:52.796 --> 04:54.798
I HAVE TO TAKE SARAH TO HAVE
HER NITS CHECKED, FIRST THING.

04:55.006 --> 04:56.553
BUT IF YOU MEAN DO I DERIVE PLEASURE

04:56.758 --> 04:58.510
FROM NOT HAVING TO ENGAGE
EMOTIONALLY OR INTELLECTUALLY,

04:58.718 --> 05:00.186
THEN, YES.

05:00.386 --> 05:01.808
WELL, DOESN'T IT WORRY YOU
THAT SARAH COULD WRITE

05:02.013 --> 05:03.560
MORE STYLISHLY THAN...

05:03.765 --> 05:05.563
"LYDIA LOVEMORE"?

05:05.767 --> 05:07.485
IT WOULD WORRY ME IF SHE
WROTE SOME OF THIS STUFF,

05:07.685 --> 05:08.811
I CAN TELL YOU.

05:09.020 --> 05:10.522
WHAT LYDIA DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT BDSM

05:10.730 --> 05:12.323
- ISN'T WORTH KNOWING.
- BD WHAT?

05:12.524 --> 05:14.822
"BONDAGE DISCIPLINE, SADISM AND MASOCHISM."

05:15.026 --> 05:16.448
DON'T YOU KNOW ANYTHING?

05:16.653 --> 05:18.155
I'M PROUD TO SAY I DON'T.

05:18.363 --> 05:20.206
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK.

05:20.406 --> 05:22.875
AND IN ANSWER TO YOUR EARLIER QUESTION,

05:23.076 --> 05:26.205
YES, I DO WANT TO BE ENSLAVED,

05:26.412 --> 05:28.665
CORRUPTED, BEATEN AND HUMILIATED,

05:28.873 --> 05:31.001
BUT NOT BY YOU, DARLING.
YOU'D SPEND THE WHOLE TIME

05:31.209 --> 05:33.507
WORRYING ABOUT SENTENCE CONSTRUCTION.

05:33.711 --> 05:35.805
IT'S THE BASIS OF ALL GOOD WRITING.

05:36.005 --> 05:38.178
WELL, THAT'S A BIG RICH,
COMING FROM SOMEONE

05:38.383 --> 05:39.350
WHO'S BEEN PLANNING THAT GREAT NOVEL

05:39.551 --> 05:42.350
SINCE THE FIRST DAY WE MET.

05:42.554 --> 05:44.556
THE SYNTAX MAY LEAVE
SOMETHING TO BE DESIRED.

05:44.764 --> 05:46.482
BUT AT LEAST LYDIA GETS ON HER ASS

05:46.683 --> 05:48.060
AND ACTUALLY WRITES SOMETHING.

05:58.194 --> 06:00.037
AFTER THE NIT PARADE, I'M OFF TO LONDON

06:00.238 --> 06:02.832
TO SEE MY DODGY CLIENT, THEN
I'M TAKING ZOE OUT TO TEA,

06:03.032 --> 06:05.000
AND DON'T FORGET IT'S DAD-AND-SON
KARATE AFTER SCHOOL.

06:05.201 --> 06:07.545
- OH, SHIT.
- MOM, DAD SAID A RUDE WORD.

06:07.745 --> 06:10.464
OH, FORGIVE HIM, DARLING, HE'S NERVOUS
ABOUT BEING HUMILIATED BY YOU.

06:10.665 --> 06:12.793
DON'T YOU WANT SOME
SUPERIOR READING MATTER?

06:13.001 --> 06:15.925
I HAVE A ZOO-PAGE BRIEF, BUT
THANKS FOR THE THOUGHT.

06:16.129 --> 06:18.848
- WHEN WILL YOU BE BACK?
- IN TIME FOR THE WOMEN'S INSTITUTE.

06:19.048 --> 06:21.426
- WHAT?
- THEY'RE HOLDING A SPECIAL LECTURE...

06:21.634 --> 06:25.605
"HOW TO AVOID ROPE BURNS
IN BONDAGE SITUATIONS."

06:25.805 --> 06:26.772
BYE.

06:29.058 --> 06:30.981
WELL, I THINK IT'S A SHAME.

06:31.185 --> 06:33.062
SURELY THEY COULD HAVE CALLED YOU.

06:33.271 --> 06:36.150
- WELL, THEY MAY HAVE.
- MM-HMM.

06:36.357 --> 06:38.451
I'M HAVING A BIT OF TROUBLE WITH MY PHONE.

06:38.651 --> 06:39.903
OH, SORRY.

06:40.111 --> 06:42.079
LET ME AT LEAST GIVE YOU
SOMETHING TOWARDS THIS.

06:42.280 --> 06:46.285
NO, THANK YOU, BUT, NO.

06:46.492 --> 06:48.244
I'VE GOT TO DO THIS ON MY OWN.

06:48.453 --> 06:50.080
CAN'T GO SCROUNGING OFF MY SISTER

06:50.288 --> 06:52.165
EVERY TIME THINGS GET A BIT TOUGH.

06:57.337 --> 06:59.339
I KNOW YOU'RE A WONDERFUL ACTRESS,

06:59.547 --> 07:01.766
AND YOU'RE LIVING YOUR DREAM,

07:01.966 --> 07:04.719
BUT IS IT WHAT YOU REALLY...

07:04.928 --> 07:06.896
- WHAT I WANT?
- YEAH.

07:07.096 --> 07:09.599
YES.

07:09.807 --> 07:12.606
WHAT I OUGHT TO DO, I DON'T KNOW.

07:12.810 --> 07:14.357
BUT I'M DAMNED IF I'M GIVING UP NOW

07:14.562 --> 07:16.485
AFTER EVERYTHING I'VE DONE TO GET HERE.

08:34.183 --> 08:37.482
SEE WHAT YOU CAN DIG UP
ABOUT THESE VEGETABLE WARS.

08:37.687 --> 08:39.030
PARDON THE PUN.

08:39.230 --> 08:41.982
MIGHT BE A STORY THERE,
LIKE THAT MAD BUTCHER

08:42.191 --> 08:44.535
AND HIS FOOTBALL TEAM-COLORED SAUSAGES.

08:44.736 --> 08:47.364
MUST GO, ANNA WINTOUR'S HERE.

08:47.572 --> 08:50.075
IF I WAS ANNA WINTOUR IT'S
UNLIKELY I'D HAVE SOMEONE

08:50.283 --> 08:51.876
WHO LOOKS LIKE YOU WORKING FOR ME.

08:52.076 --> 08:54.875
FAIR POINT. AND IT'S ALWAYS
DELIGHTFUL TO SEE YOU.

08:55.079 --> 08:57.173
GOOD, BECAUSE I'VE TREKKED ALL THE WAY UP

08:57.373 --> 08:59.967
TO YOUR LITTLE FIEFDOM TO
GIVE YOU SOME NICE NEWS.

09:00.168 --> 09:02.136
OH, IN THAT CASE, TAKE THE
WEIGHT OFF YOUR FEET.

09:02.336 --> 09:04.930
DARREN! COFFEE FOR CLAIRE.

09:05.131 --> 09:08.556
SHE'S BROUGHT NICE NEWS.

09:08.760 --> 09:10.603
NOW, AS YOU KNOW, THE ONLINE CHANNEL

09:10.803 --> 09:12.396
HAS DONE BETTER THAN EXPECTED,

09:12.597 --> 09:15.225
SO IN PREPARATION FOR THE
FULL BROADCAST OFFERING

09:15.433 --> 09:16.855
LATER IN THE YEAR,

09:17.060 --> 09:20.314
I'VE DECIDED TO INTRODUCE
A WEEKLY CULTURAL SHOW.

09:20.521 --> 09:22.194
GOOD LUCK.

09:22.398 --> 09:25.823
TELL ME, DAVID, DO YOU FEEL
CHALLENGED IN THIS JOB?

09:26.027 --> 09:27.779
EVERY DAY IS A CHALLENGE, CLAIRE.

09:27.987 --> 09:30.410
TODAY, FOR EXAMPLE, IS KARAT PRICE FIXING.

09:30.615 --> 09:32.868
BECAUSE I THINK WE SHOULD
ENCOURAGE YOUR INTEREST

09:33.076 --> 09:35.955
IN LITERATURE AND THE ARTS
BEFORE YOU BECOME IRREDEEMABLY

09:36.162 --> 09:37.914
CYNICAL AND JADED.

09:38.122 --> 09:40.250
I WANT YOU TO HOST THE NEW SHOW.

09:40.458 --> 09:43.007
BUT I'VE NEVER DONE
ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE.

09:43.211 --> 09:45.589
GOOD. A FRESH VOICE.

09:45.797 --> 09:47.470
AND LET'S FACE IT, DAVID,
YOU'RE PRETTY FOND

09:47.673 --> 09:48.890
OF THE SOUND OF YOUR OWN VOICE.

09:49.092 --> 09:51.311
ASSUMING I'M FAINTLY INTERESTED,

09:51.511 --> 09:53.104
HOW WILL IT WORK TECHNICALLY?

09:53.304 --> 09:55.773
AH, JUST THE PERSON.

09:55.973 --> 09:58.522
I TAKE IT YOU KNOW HOW TO OPERATE
YOUR CAMERA IN VIDEO MODE?

09:58.726 --> 10:00.728
OF COURSE. IN FACT, I'VE BEEN DOING...

10:00.937 --> 10:02.154
YES, I'M SURE YOU HAVE.

10:02.355 --> 10:03.607
SO, THAT'S FIXED.

10:03.815 --> 10:06.318
WE CAN'T AFFORD A STUDIO UNTIL WE GET

10:06.526 --> 10:09.370
ONTO THE BROADCAST NETWORKS,
SO UNTIL THEN YOU CAN DO

10:09.570 --> 10:12.198
PIECES HERE IN THE OFFICE
OR WHEREVER CULTURE

10:12.406 --> 10:14.329
REARS ITS UGLY HEAD,

10:14.534 --> 10:17.208
YOU AND YOUNG "CARTIER-BRESSON" THERE.

10:17.411 --> 10:18.537
THAT'S DARREN.

10:18.746 --> 10:19.963
HOW LOVELY TO MEET YOU, DARREN.

10:20.164 --> 10:23.043
DAVID TALKS ABOUT YOU NONSTOP.

10:23.251 --> 10:25.754
NOW, I MUST BE OFF. IT'S
THE NORFOLK FOOD AWARDS,

10:25.962 --> 10:29.432
AND WE'RE SPONSORING THE
MOST IMAGINATIVE PIE.

10:32.760 --> 10:37.186
BY THE WAY, WHAT'S YOUR TAKE
ON THE MUMMY PORN PHENOMENON?

10:37.390 --> 10:40.439
"SHE CAME IN CHAINS," AND SO FORTH?

10:40.643 --> 10:42.236
I THINK IT'S APPALLING.

10:42.436 --> 10:45.815
GOOD. SO YOU'LL DO A PIECE
ON IT FOR THE SHOW, THEN.

10:46.023 --> 10:49.368
WELL, I'LL TRY AND FIND
SOME CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE.

10:53.948 --> 10:59.796
SO, IN A WORLD WHERE SEX ACROSS THE MEDIA

10:59.996 --> 11:03.250
IS ALL TOO EASILY AVAILABLE,

11:03.457 --> 11:06.631
AND THE GRADUAL PLAYING OUT
OF A LOVE AFFAIR IS REPLACED

11:06.836 --> 11:11.683
BY... UGH... INSTANT JOYLESS FORNICATION,

11:11.883 --> 11:14.136
WE MIGHT BE WELL SERVED BY LOOKING BACK

11:14.343 --> 11:16.095
TO JANE AUSTEN.

11:16.304 --> 11:21.356
SPECIFICALLY, AT "PRIDE AND PREJUDICE."

11:21.559 --> 11:25.484
QUITE APART FROM THE FACT THAT
IT IS ON THIS YEAR'S SYLLABUS,

11:25.688 --> 11:28.237
IF YOU READ IT PROPERLY, YOU MAY JUST FIND

11:28.441 --> 11:30.159
THAT THERE ARE EMOTIONS EXPRESSED IN IT

11:30.359 --> 11:31.611
THAT MIGHT SURPRISE YOU.

11:31.819 --> 11:34.038
MR. DARCY IN HIS WET SHIRT.

11:34.238 --> 11:35.615
MY MUM'S WORN THE DVD OUT.

11:35.823 --> 11:39.202
A SCENE NOT ACTUALLY
PORTRAYED BY THE AUTHOR,

11:39.410 --> 11:42.630
BUT CERTAINLY AN APPROPRIATE
MODERN SCREEN INTERPRETATION.

11:42.830 --> 11:45.674
THAT COLIN FIRTH IS REALLY HOT.

11:45.875 --> 11:47.969
- HE'S A POSH PLONKER.
- AND YOU'RE NOT?

11:48.169 --> 11:51.389
MOVING ON FROM THESE
SOPHISTICATED APPRAISALS

11:51.589 --> 11:54.183
OF MR. FIRTH'S ACTING ABILITY,

11:54.383 --> 11:58.809
WHAT I'M TRYING TO CONVEY, IS
THAT DESPITE THE LAKE SCENE,

11:59.013 --> 12:00.765
THE MAKERS OF THAT ADAPTATION

12:00.973 --> 12:04.068
GENERALLY CHOSE TO REFLECT
JANE AUSTEN'S ABILITY

12:04.268 --> 12:07.112
TO INFUSE HER NARRATIVES

12:07.313 --> 12:10.692
WITH A SUBTLE EROTICISM,

12:10.900 --> 12:14.996
WHICH IS ALL THE MORE
EFFECTIVE BY NOT BEING OVERT.

12:15.196 --> 12:17.619
SIR, THERE'S AN EROTIC VERSION

12:17.823 --> 12:19.370
OF "PRIDE AND PREJUDICE" ON THE INTERNET.

12:19.575 --> 12:20.827
HAVE YOU READ IT?

12:21.035 --> 12:23.083
I'D RATHER PIERCE MY TIRED OLD EYES.

12:23.287 --> 12:25.255
COLIN FIRTH'S IN THE "BRIDGET JONES" FILMS.

12:25.456 --> 12:26.378
I'M SURE HE IS.

12:26.582 --> 12:28.129
CAN WE RETURN TO THE SUBJECT?

12:28.334 --> 12:30.928
WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY
THAT HELEN FIELDING'S

12:31.087 --> 12:32.805
NO DIFFERENT FROM JANE AUSTIN, SIR?

12:33.005 --> 12:35.303
MONSTROUSLY UNFAIR, I SHOULD THINK.

12:35.508 --> 12:36.805
YOUR POINT BEING?

12:37.009 --> 12:39.353
PAGE ONE.

12:39.553 --> 12:42.932
"IT IS A TRUTH UNIVERSALLY
ACKNOWLEDGED THAT A SINGLE MAN

12:43.140 --> 12:44.483
IN POSSESSION OF A GOOD FORTUNE,

12:44.684 --> 12:46.402
MUST BE IN WANT OF A WIFE."

12:46.602 --> 12:48.730
ELIZABETH BENNET WANTS TO BE MARRIED,

12:48.938 --> 12:51.361
DESPITE HOW SHE BEHAVES TO MR. DARCY,

12:51.565 --> 12:54.318
SO DOES BRIDGET JONES TO MR. DARCY.

12:54.527 --> 12:56.950
- NOTHING'S CHANGED REALLY.
- WELL, THAT'S A GOOD POINT,

12:57.154 --> 13:02.285
EXCEPT THAT MISS FIELDING CANNOT
BE COMPARED TO JANE AUSTEN.

13:02.535 --> 13:05.459
WELL, ACTUALLY, SIR, THE
FIRST BOOK WAS MEANT

13:05.663 --> 13:07.085
AS AN HOMAGE TO AUSTEN.

13:07.290 --> 13:09.668
FIELDING'S FUNNY, AND SO IS AUSTEN,

13:09.875 --> 13:12.298
AND THERE'S NOTHING REALLY
EROTIC IN EITHER BOOK.

13:12.503 --> 13:14.221
NOT WHEN SHE'S WEARING
THOSE SCARY KNICKERS.

13:15.715 --> 13:18.514
NOW THAT'S ENOUGH.

13:18.718 --> 13:20.720
I BELIEVE MISS FIELDING IS THE PURVEYOR

13:20.928 --> 13:23.226
OF WHAT IS TERMED "CHICKLIT."

13:23.431 --> 13:25.650
JANE AUSTEN WROTE GREAT LIT,

13:25.850 --> 13:28.148
AS WE WILL NOW SET ABOUT DISCOVERING.

13:28.352 --> 13:31.026
SIR, IT'S "MUMMY PORN" NOW.

13:31.230 --> 13:32.072
MUMMY WHAT?

13:32.273 --> 13:33.866
MUMMY PORN, SIR.

13:34.066 --> 13:36.535
BONDAGE, S&M, YOU KNOW.

13:36.736 --> 13:40.366
I MOST CERTAINLY DON'T
KNOW, NOR DO I WISH TO.

13:40.573 --> 13:43.497
SIR, YOU ALWAYS TELL US
THERE'S NO ROOM FOR IGNORANCE

13:43.701 --> 13:45.374
IN LITERARY ANALYSIS,

13:45.578 --> 13:46.830
SURELY YOU SHOULD READ SOME OF THIS STUFF

13:47.038 --> 13:48.790
BEFORE DISMISSING IT.

13:48.998 --> 13:50.921
IF SOMEONE HELD A GUN TO MY HEAD,

13:51.125 --> 13:52.422
I WOULD REFUSE.

13:52.626 --> 13:55.971
AND IF I DISCOVER ANY OF YOU YOUNG LADIES

13:56.172 --> 13:59.016
SAMPLING THIS REVOLTING EXPRESSION

13:59.216 --> 14:01.514
OF 2IST-CENTURY DECADENCE,

14:01.719 --> 14:04.017
I SHOULD HAVE TO RETIRE IMMEDIATELY.

14:04.221 --> 14:07.270
NOW, "PRIDE AND PREJUDICE."

14:13.522 --> 14:15.524
DO YOU HAVE "SHE CAME IN CHAINS"?

14:15.733 --> 14:18.077
I CAN'T SEEM TO FIND IT ON THE SHELVES.

14:18.277 --> 14:19.870
I DON'T KNOW.

14:20.071 --> 14:21.539
WELL, COULD YOU CHECK, PLEASE?

14:21.739 --> 14:23.833
WELL, I COULD, BUT, DIANA,

14:24.033 --> 14:26.081
IT'S REALLY NOT A GOOD BOOK.

14:26.285 --> 14:27.753
I DON'T WANT A GOOD BOOK.

14:27.953 --> 14:29.205
I HAVE HUNDREDS OF GOOD BOOKS.

14:29.413 --> 14:30.960
I WANT TO READ, "SHE CAME IN CHAINS."

14:31.165 --> 14:33.543
AND IF YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED
IN SELLING IT TO ME

14:33.751 --> 14:35.344
I'LL BUY IT ON AMAZON, WHICH IS PROBABLY

14:35.544 --> 14:36.761
WHAT I SHOULD HAVE DONE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

14:36.962 --> 14:38.509
DIANA, PLEASE, WE DO NOT USE THE "A" WORD

14:38.714 --> 14:40.967
IN OUR LITTLE EMPORIUM.
ANYTHING I CAN HELP YOU WITH?

14:41.175 --> 14:42.927
MARCUS, HERE, SEEMS TO THINK IT'S HIS DUTY

14:43.135 --> 14:45.137
TO BE MY PERSONAL LITERARY GUARDIAN.

14:45.346 --> 14:47.474
- OH.
- I CAME IN TO BUY A BOOK,

14:47.681 --> 14:50.651
WHICH, AS A LOYAL SUPPORTER
OF THE ONLY INDEPENDENT

14:50.851 --> 14:54.731
BOOK SHOP FOR MILES
AROUND, I DO, FREQUENTLY.

14:54.939 --> 14:56.737
BUT I DON'T HAVE TO.

14:56.941 --> 15:00.445
- SORRY, DIANA, I DIDN'T THINK...
- NO, YOU DIDN'T.

15:00.653 --> 15:02.906
THE FACT IS I WANT A LITTLE LIGHT RELIEF,

15:03.114 --> 15:04.991
IF YOU'LL PARDON THE EXPRESSION.

15:05.199 --> 15:06.451
AND I DIDN'T THINK I'D HAVE TO PASS

15:06.659 --> 15:08.457
SOME SORT OF ELIGIBILITY TEST.

15:08.661 --> 15:10.254
OH, OF COURSE NOT. I'LL GET YOU A COPY.

15:10.454 --> 15:11.876
WE JUST HAD A DELIVERY.

15:12.081 --> 15:13.708
IT'S SELLING AWFULLY WELL, YOU KNOW.

15:16.377 --> 15:18.004
I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN TO
INSULT YOU, IT'S JUST THAT

15:18.212 --> 15:19.680
HAVING READ YOUR PORTRAIT,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY

15:19.880 --> 15:21.348
YOU'D WANT SOMETHING THAT
IS SO BADLY WRITTEN,

15:21.549 --> 15:23.267
QUITE APART FROM ITS CONTENT.

15:23.467 --> 15:26.562
I'M A BIG GIRL, AND I'M SURE
I CAN COPE WITH ITS CONTENT.

15:26.762 --> 15:30.016
AS FOR THE MERITS, OR
OTHERWISE OF THE WRITING,

15:30.224 --> 15:32.101
WHO CARES? MY LAST COLLECTION...

15:32.309 --> 15:33.982
"BUMFIGHTS AND BEATITUDES."

15:34.186 --> 15:35.688
WELL REMEMBERED.

15:35.896 --> 15:37.898
SOLD 104 COPIES.

15:38.107 --> 15:41.156
I HAVE 104 FRIENDS AND RELATIVES.

15:41.360 --> 15:43.658
WHAT'S WRONG WITH A WOMAN MAKING MONEY

15:43.863 --> 15:45.786
FROM WRITING NOVELS LIKE THESE?

15:45.990 --> 15:47.663
THEY'RE NOT DOING ANY HARM, ARE THEY?

15:47.867 --> 15:51.542
I SUPPOSE NOT, BUT, I MEAN
ANYBODY COULD WRITE THIS STUFF.

15:51.745 --> 15:53.622
- I BET YOU COULDN'T.
- WELL, I WOULDN'T.

15:53.831 --> 15:56.004
BUT IF SOMEBODY SAID, "HERE'S
A MILLION-POUND ADVANCE,"

15:56.208 --> 15:58.210
WOULD YOU TAKE A SHOT?

15:58.419 --> 15:59.545
NO.

15:59.753 --> 16:01.881
WELL, WELL, I MEAN, MAYBE.

16:02.089 --> 16:03.716
YES, BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

16:03.924 --> 16:06.518
HERE YOU ARE. HAVE YOU GOT
YOUR LOYALTY CARD, DIANA?

16:06.719 --> 16:09.393
POP THAT IN A BAG FOR
ME, WOULD YOU, MARCUS?

16:09.597 --> 16:13.568
- THANK YOU.
- OH, CONGRATULATIONS.

16:13.767 --> 16:14.984
IT APPEARS YOU HAVE A FREE BOOK.

16:15.186 --> 16:16.813
AH, THANK YOU.

16:17.021 --> 16:18.113
WE HOPE YOU ENJOY IT.

16:18.314 --> 16:20.442
PLEASE, COME BACK TO US SOON.

16:20.649 --> 16:22.242
I'LL CONSIDER IT.

16:25.029 --> 16:27.828
NEXT TIME YOU DECIDE TO INSULT ONE
OF OUR MOST VALUED CUSTOMERS,

16:28.032 --> 16:29.500
YOU MIGHT REMIND YOURSELF
THAT WE ARE THE WIDTH

16:29.700 --> 16:33.580
OF A PAPERBACK NOVELLA
AWAY FROM BANKRUPTCY.

16:33.787 --> 16:35.789
OR ARE YOU TOO IDEALISTIC TO CARE?

16:44.089 --> 16:47.184
DAVID, UNLIKE YOU TO DO
THE LUNCHTIME SESSION.

16:47.384 --> 16:48.852
I'LL JUST HAVE A HALF.

16:49.053 --> 16:50.521
I'M DROWNING MY SORROWS, ACTUALLY.

16:50.721 --> 16:53.065
I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ON THIS CHICKLIT

16:53.265 --> 16:55.313
MUMMY PORN THING FOR A WEBCAST.

16:55.518 --> 16:57.361
HMM, LOOK AT THIS!

16:57.561 --> 17:01.691
"PARADISE POSTPONED," "THE WHIPPING BOY,"

17:01.899 --> 17:03.196
"MANACLES AND MANICURES."

17:03.400 --> 17:04.821
YOU SEE WHY I NEED A DRINK.

17:05.027 --> 17:06.994
YOU DO HAVE SOME BEER?

17:07.195 --> 17:10.075
WE DO TODAY.

17:10.281 --> 17:14.537
CHRIS, WHAT'S WITH ALL THE RATIONING?

17:14.744 --> 17:16.622
AH, SHIT. CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET?

17:16.829 --> 17:19.583
- NO HEADLINES IN YOUR PAPER?
- OF COURSE

17:19.791 --> 17:21.920
I'VE BEEN TOLD NOT TO REORDER UNTIL
THE LAST BARREL'S BEEN TAPPED.

17:22.086 --> 17:23.713
IT'S A CASH FLOW THING.

17:23.921 --> 17:25.468
YOU CAN'T RUN A PUB LIKE THAT.

17:25.673 --> 17:27.220
I KNOW, BUT THE FACT IS, DAD'S BROKE.

17:27.424 --> 17:29.518
EVERY PENNY COUNTS.

17:29.718 --> 17:31.311
IT'S WORSE THAN THAT, ACTUALLY.

17:31.512 --> 17:33.435
THE OWNERS ARE PLANNING TO SELL THIS PLACE.

17:33.639 --> 17:35.266
TURN IT INTO HOLIDAY APARTMENTS.

17:35.474 --> 17:36.600
TO BE FAIR, THEY DON'T WANT TO,

17:36.809 --> 17:38.982
BUT THEY'RE BROKE, TOO.

17:39.186 --> 17:41.814
HOW MUCH DO THEY WANT, IF
YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING?

17:42.022 --> 17:45.196
THAT'S THE CRAZY THING. THEY'RE PREPARED
TO LET DAD BUY IT FOR 300 GRAND

17:45.401 --> 17:49.781
TO KEEP IT AS A PUB, BUT HE'S GOT THREE
OTHER PUBS WITH THE SAME PROBLEM.

17:49.989 --> 17:52.833
AND HE PUT SO MUCH MONEY INTO
REFURBISHING THIS PLACE.

17:53.033 --> 17:55.502
DOESN'T SEEM FAIR.

17:55.703 --> 17:57.455
I'M REALLY SORRY, CHRIS.

17:59.331 --> 18:00.958
SEE YOU NEXT WEEK FOR DOMINOES.

18:01.166 --> 18:02.588
IF WE'RE STILL HERE.

18:13.470 --> 18:14.722
HERE'S YOUR FILES.

18:14.930 --> 18:17.649
OH, THANK YOU, BETH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

18:17.850 --> 18:18.851
THANK YOU.

18:27.443 --> 18:29.662
- HELLO, DAVID.
- GOOD MORNING, LISA.

18:49.798 --> 18:53.177
BEFORE I HUMILIATE YOU LESSER MORTALS,

18:53.385 --> 18:56.559
I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU.

18:56.764 --> 19:01.235
MUMMY PORN, IS IT SOMETHING
NASTY THEY DO IN PYRAMIDS?

19:01.435 --> 19:02.857
SOMETHING NASTY THAT THEY PUBLISH

19:03.062 --> 19:05.690
FOR WOMEN OF A CERTAIN AGE.
WELL, ANY AGE, ACTUALLY.

19:05.898 --> 19:07.241
"FIFTY SHADES OF"... WHAT'S IT CALLED?

19:07.441 --> 19:09.489
OH, AH. MY MISSUS READ THAT.

19:09.693 --> 19:12.037
I'M STILL WAITIN'.

19:12.237 --> 19:13.363
WHY DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?

19:13.572 --> 19:16.701
MY GCSE CLASS INSISTS ON DISCUSSING IT

19:16.909 --> 19:18.582
WHEN THEY SHOULD BE STUDYING JANE AUSTEN.

19:18.786 --> 19:20.129
WELL, IT'S CERTAINLY NOT JANE AUSTEN.

19:20.329 --> 19:22.331
MY MUM READS MUMMY PORN.
SAYS IT LIBERATES HER.

19:22.539 --> 19:25.213
- IN WHAT WAY?
- SHE SAYS IT'S EDUCATIONAL.

19:25.417 --> 19:27.215
IS IT TITILLATING?

19:27.419 --> 19:29.262
- SHOCKING?
- ALL THAT AND MORE.

19:29.463 --> 19:32.262
IMAGINE BARBARA CARTLAND WITH
WHIPS AND CHAINS. OH, GOD.

19:32.466 --> 19:33.968
IMAGINE MINIMUM LITERARY MERIT

19:34.176 --> 19:36.599
- AND MAXIMUM SEXUAL DEVIATION.
- GOOD GOD.

19:36.804 --> 19:37.976
THINK OF WOMEN EAGER TO SUBMIT

19:38.180 --> 19:40.478
TO THE MOST RIGOROUS SEXUAL DOMINATION.

19:40.683 --> 19:42.481
AND PLEASE DON'T SAY, "GOOD GOD" AGAIN.

19:42.685 --> 19:45.939
- BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW ABOUT ALL THIS?
- MY WIFE.

19:46.146 --> 19:47.773
I THOUGHT SHE WAS A LAWYER.

19:47.981 --> 19:51.281
AH, SHE'S GOING TO PUT SOME
OF THESE PORNOGRAPHERS AWAY.

19:51.485 --> 19:53.328
GOOD ON HER.

19:53.529 --> 19:56.453
SHE'S DEVELOPED A STRANGE OBSESSION
WITH READING THESE BOOKS.

19:56.657 --> 19:58.079
THE NEW RELEASE OF "LIFE IN THE BOUDOIR"?

19:58.283 --> 19:59.830
CHAUCER'D BE A FINE THING.

20:00.035 --> 20:03.505
I HAD TO READ SOME MYSELF
FOR A PIECE I'M DOING.

20:03.706 --> 20:06.710
AND IT GOT ME THINKING ABOUT
THE FUTURE OF THE PUB.

20:06.917 --> 20:09.466
I'M SORRY, BUT THAT IS A NON-SEQUITUR.

20:09.670 --> 20:11.547
ACTUALLY, IT'S NOT.

20:11.755 --> 20:15.134
CHRIS, I HAVE NO INTENTION
OF SHARING YOUR TROUBLES

20:15.342 --> 20:19.893
BEYOND THIS TABLE, BUT, CAN I
SHARE THEM WITH YOUR FRIENDS?

20:20.097 --> 20:22.566
WELL, IT'S A BIT LATE TO SAY NO.

20:22.766 --> 20:26.612
HERE'S THE THING, THE OWNERS
ARE GOING TO CLOSE THIS PLACE.

20:26.812 --> 20:28.439
WHAT?!

20:28.647 --> 20:30.274
THAT'S APPALLING.

20:30.482 --> 20:33.156
CHRIS'S DAD NEEDS 300,000 TO BUY IT

20:33.360 --> 20:35.237
AND KEEP IT AS A PUB.

20:35.446 --> 20:36.698
LOOK AROUND.

20:36.905 --> 20:38.532
WHERE ARE THOSE LOT GONNA GO?

20:38.741 --> 20:43.087
IT'S A UNIQUE CROSS-SECTION OF SOCIETY.

20:43.287 --> 20:46.791
AND READING THESE BOOKS GAVE ME AN IDEA.

20:46.999 --> 20:47.841
I'LL BE DAMNED.

20:48.041 --> 20:50.089
YOU'RE AHEAD OF ME.

20:50.294 --> 20:51.762
SOMEBODY IN THE SHOP THE
OTHER DAY SUGGESTED

20:51.962 --> 20:53.555
I TRY WRITING SOMETHING LIKE
THIS TO MAKE SOME MONEY.

20:53.756 --> 20:56.930
EXACTLY. SO WHY DON'T WE?

20:57.134 --> 20:58.226
DO WHAT?

20:58.427 --> 21:00.930
BECOME "CHICKLITTERS," OR BETTER STILL,

21:01.138 --> 21:02.014
"MUMMY PORNERS."

21:02.222 --> 21:04.816
HAVE YOU GONE COMPLETELY MAD?

21:05.017 --> 21:07.065
- POSSIBLY.
- DEFINITELY.

21:07.269 --> 21:08.942
QUITE APART FROM THE MORAL ISSUE

21:09.146 --> 21:11.649
OF SPAWNING YET MORE OF THIS FILTH,

21:11.857 --> 21:14.155
THERE'S A SMALL MATTER OF OUR REPUTATIONS.

21:14.359 --> 21:15.781
WE CAN'T HAVE THE REGION'S FINEST

21:15.986 --> 21:17.704
INDEPENDENT BOOKSHOP BEING
RUN BY A PORNOGRAPHER.

21:17.905 --> 21:19.657
NO, WE'LL HAVE TO WRITE
UNDER A <i>NOM DE PLUME.</i>

21:19.865 --> 21:21.082
CHRIST, YES.

21:21.283 --> 21:22.956
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT JEN WOULD SAY?

21:23.160 --> 21:26.004
AND I'M ABOUT TO DO A WEBCAST
SLAGGING IT ALL OFF.

21:26.205 --> 21:30.585
BUT... BUT
NONE OF US ARE NOVELISTS.

21:30.793 --> 21:32.340
I THINK THAT MIGHT BE AN ADVANTAGE.

21:32.544 --> 21:35.297
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH LYDIA LOVEMORE

21:35.506 --> 21:36.678
EARNED FROM HER LAST BOOK?

21:36.882 --> 21:38.850
OH, I KNOW THIS ONE. FOUR MILLION QUID

21:39.051 --> 21:39.973
AND THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE THE FILM RIGHTS.

21:40.177 --> 21:42.771
GOOD GOD.

21:42.971 --> 21:44.848
IT STILL DOESN'T ALTER THE FACTS.

21:45.057 --> 21:47.776
THE NEAREST I GET TO WRITING
IS THE DRAMA REVIEW

21:47.976 --> 21:50.024
IN THE SCHOOL MAG AND
I'M AN ENGLISH TEACHER.

21:50.229 --> 21:51.355
WELL, IT CAN'T BE THAT HARD, CAN IT?

21:51.563 --> 21:53.315
ALL WE NEED IS A COMPUTER AND JUST...

21:53.524 --> 21:55.276
OR A PEN AND PAPER.

21:55.484 --> 21:58.909
WHY AM I EVEN
CONSIDERING THIS LUNATIC NOTION?

21:59.112 --> 22:02.616
BECAUSE YOU WANT TO DRINK
YOUR PINTS IN A PROPER PUB.

22:02.825 --> 22:04.372
LOOK, WE ALL HAVE CONCERNS,

22:04.618 --> 22:07.121
BUT LET'S AT LEAST GIVE IT A GO.

22:07.329 --> 22:10.333
I BROUGHT SOME SAMPLE
MATERIAL FOR YOU TO READ,

22:10.541 --> 22:12.259
COURTESY OF JEN.

22:12.459 --> 22:17.090
NOTE HOW I'M PROTECTING YOUR
FINER FEELINGS, JUSTIN.

22:17.297 --> 22:18.970
YEAH.

22:19.174 --> 22:21.222
EVER MINDFUL OF YOUR ADVANCED AGE,

22:21.426 --> 22:23.474
I'VE AVOIDED TOO MUCH BUMP AND GRIND.

22:23.679 --> 22:26.899
THIS ONE IS ALMOST POETIC
IN THE BROADEST SENSE.

22:27.099 --> 22:30.774
YOURS, HOWEVER, AS BEFITS
A YOUNG AND STURDY LAD,

22:30.978 --> 22:33.072
IS FILTH FROM COVER TO COVER.

22:33.272 --> 22:35.741
MULTIPLE ORGASMS EVERY THREE PAGES.

22:35.941 --> 22:38.285
THE HEROINE REDEFINES
THE WORD "NYMPHOMANIAC"

22:38.485 --> 22:42.206
AND HER TUMESCENT PARAMOUR
HAS THE CONSTITUTION

22:42.406 --> 22:43.532
OF A HEREFORD BULL.

22:43.740 --> 22:45.834
- YOU'LL LOVE IT.
- THANKS.

22:46.034 --> 22:47.752
MARCUS HAS THE PRIVILEGE OF OWNING A SHOP

22:47.953 --> 22:49.796
PACKED WITH THESE LITERARY GEMS,

22:49.997 --> 22:53.592
AND I MYSELF HAVE GORGED
OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS

22:53.792 --> 22:57.638
AND FEEL CONFIDENT IN MY
GRASP OF THE SUBJECT.

22:57.838 --> 23:00.512
SO, WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU SUGGESTING WE DO?

23:00.716 --> 23:03.435
COUNT THE CLIMAXES AND DRAW A GRAPH?

23:03.635 --> 23:08.641
I SUGGEST THAT WE ALL WRITE A
COUPLE OF PAGES OF PURPLE PROSE,

23:08.849 --> 23:10.943
BRING IT NEXT WEEK AND SEE
IF WE CAN JOIN IT UP.

23:11.143 --> 23:13.612
THEN WE CAN DECIDE HOW TO PROCEED.

23:13.812 --> 23:15.655
TWO PAGES, THAT'S YOUR LOT.

23:15.856 --> 23:18.109
NOW, CAN WE PLAY, PLEASE?

23:25.824 --> 23:27.747
GOOD THING I'M NOT SUPERSTITIOUS.

23:31.663 --> 23:33.381
ENJOY YOUR SATURDAY JOB?

23:33.582 --> 23:35.835
I'M JUST MAKING SOME NOTES...
FOR THIS CULTURE SHOW THING.

23:36.043 --> 23:37.386
I THOUGHT YOU'D TAKEN THEM SWIMMING.

23:37.586 --> 23:39.759
UH, MISSION ABORTED. TURD IN THE POOL.

23:39.963 --> 23:41.681
- NOT CHARLIE?
- GOD, I HOPE NOT.

23:41.882 --> 23:43.134
IT WASN'T YOU, WAS IT, DARLING?

23:43.342 --> 23:44.844
- OF COURSE IT WASN'T.
- IT WAS A GIRL.

23:45.052 --> 23:46.395
WHEN SHE TOOK HER COSTUME OFF...

23:46.595 --> 23:48.097
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S ENOUGH, GO PLAY OUTSIDE

23:48.305 --> 23:50.057
UNTIL I CALL YOU FOR LUNCH.

23:52.142 --> 23:54.190
SO, WHAT CULTURAL PEARLS
ARE YOU GOING TO FEED

23:54.394 --> 23:55.520
TO THE ONLINE SWINE, THEN?

23:55.729 --> 23:57.948
OH, NO, IT'S VERY EARLY STAGES.

23:58.148 --> 23:59.946
- MUCH TOO EMBARRASSING.
- OH, FAIR ENOUGH.

24:00.150 --> 24:03.074
TALKING OF EMBARRASSING,
I SEEM TO HAVE MISLAID

24:03.278 --> 24:05.280
A FEW OF THOSE BOOKS YOU SO DESPISE,

24:05.489 --> 24:08.208
AND I HAVE A HORRID FEELING THAT
SARAH MIGHT HAVE PINCHED THEM.

24:08.408 --> 24:11.787
AH, NO, NO, ACTUALLY, I BORROWED THEM.

24:11.995 --> 24:13.292
WHAT? YOU OLD HYPOCRITE.

24:13.497 --> 24:14.874
WELL, I NEED TO BE BETTER INFORMED.

24:15.082 --> 24:17.460
CLAIRE WANTS ME TO DO A
PIECE FOR THE NEW SHOW.

24:17.668 --> 24:21.923
I'M THINKING
OF INVITING A CHICKLITTER

24:22.130 --> 24:23.473
TO COME ON AND PUT THEIR POINT OF VIEW.

24:23.674 --> 24:25.893
OH, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
YOU OUGHT TO ASK ME.

24:26.093 --> 24:27.640
NO WAY. YOU'RE FAR TOO ARTICULATE.

24:27.844 --> 24:29.266
I'LL TAKE THAT AS A COMPLIMENT.

24:29.471 --> 24:31.815
OH, THERE'S SOME GOOD NEWS.
ZOE'S GOT A JOB.

24:32.015 --> 24:32.857
EXCELLENT.

24:33.058 --> 24:34.935
CLEANING? DOG WALKING?

24:35.143 --> 24:37.362
YOU CYNICAL SOD. NO, ACTING. CHEKHOV.

24:37.562 --> 24:38.734
CHEKHOV?

24:38.939 --> 24:40.941
SAFE FROM SHAKESPEARE, I SUPPOSE.

24:41.149 --> 24:42.992
LADY MACBETH AS A HELL'S ANGEL

24:43.193 --> 24:44.615
STILL GIVES ME NIGHTMARES.

24:44.820 --> 24:48.495
- IT WAS THOUGHT-PROVOKING.
- IT WAS VOMIT-PROVOKING.

24:48.699 --> 24:50.542
WHAT SHE DID TO DUNCAN'S CORPSE

24:50.742 --> 24:53.165
WITH THAT MOTORBIKE CHAIN... OOH-HH!

24:53.370 --> 24:55.247
YOU COMING?

24:55.455 --> 24:57.753
THOUGHT I MIGHT START
FINISHING THE STOCK TAGGING.

24:57.958 --> 24:59.175
- IT SHOULDN'T TAKE LONG.
- WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

24:59.376 --> 25:01.344
TOMORROW'S FINE.

25:01.545 --> 25:03.673
WELL, I JUST... JUST
WANT TO PULL MY WEIGHT.

25:03.880 --> 25:06.349
BUT YOU DO. WELL, MOST OF THE
TIME, EXCEPT THAT YOU ORDER

25:06.550 --> 25:08.018
PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS NOT TO BUY BOOKS.

25:08.218 --> 25:12.314
GEOFFREY, THAT'S... THAT'S A FAIR COMMENT.

25:12.514 --> 25:17.441
WELL, I'LL... I'LL DO A COLD SUPPER.

25:17.644 --> 25:19.021
SILLY OLD THING.

25:21.773 --> 25:23.650
DON'T WORK TOO LATE.

25:43.045 --> 25:44.888
OH, TRAVEL BOOK, EH?

25:45.088 --> 25:47.261
I AIN'T NEVER BEEN TO "NORTHANGER ABBEY."

25:47.466 --> 25:50.811
- NICE PLACE, IS IT?
- YES, IT'S VERY NICE.

25:51.011 --> 25:55.107
WONDERFUL THING, THE NATIONAL
TRUST, ISN'T IT? WONDERFUL.

26:03.065 --> 26:06.990
I'M SORRY, MY LOVE, BUT I CAN'T COPE

26:07.194 --> 26:11.040
WITH YOU GAZING AT ME SO TRUSTINGLY.

26:13.742 --> 26:17.872
I'M READING ABOUT THINGS THAT YOU
AND I WOULDN'T HAVE IMAGINED.

26:18.080 --> 26:21.926
QUITE FRANKLY, WOULDN'T
HAVE ENHANCED OUR LIFE.

26:25.045 --> 26:28.049
BUT IT IS FOR A GOOD CAUSE.

26:28.256 --> 26:30.224
MAYBE NOT AS IMPORTANT AS THE BIG NEEDS,

26:30.425 --> 26:32.769
BUT IMPORTANT FOR OUR COMMUNITY.

26:37.015 --> 26:41.566
OR AM I JUSTIFYING SOMETHING THAT
I REALLY SHOULDN'T BE DOING?

26:47.400 --> 26:50.950
♪ I'M STANDING AT THE BUS STOP ♪

26:51.154 --> 26:54.579
♪ WAITING FOR THE SUN ♪

26:54.783 --> 26:57.832

27:19.057 --> 27:21.936
WELL, I THINK THAT'S ALL PRETTY DAMN GOOD.

27:22.144 --> 27:24.567
CHRIS, YOU'RE RIGHT ON THE
MONEY WITH THE VIRGIN STATUS.

27:24.771 --> 27:28.742
- DELAYED GRATIFICATION, ALWAYS EXCITING.
- THANK YOU.

27:28.942 --> 27:32.867
I'M RATHER PROUD OF THE
SILK CAT O' NINE TAILS.

27:33.071 --> 27:36.325
MARCUS, THE STUFF ABOUT THE POMMEL
HORSE IN THE GYM IS GENIUS,

27:36.533 --> 27:39.161
WHICH TAKES US TO JUSTIN'S OFFERING.

27:39.369 --> 27:43.249
YOUNG, FRIENDLY HEADMASTER
AS THE DOMINATOR.

27:43.456 --> 27:46.255
LET'S MAKE HIS SUBMISSIVE A STUDENT.

27:46.459 --> 27:49.633
THE GLORIOUS FRISSON OF
DANGER FROM ALL FRONTS.

27:49.838 --> 27:52.091
IT'S THE SCHOOL GYM IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT.

27:52.299 --> 27:53.972
IT WOULD NOT ONLY HAVE ME FIRED,

27:54.176 --> 27:55.519
BUT PROBABLY ARRESTED.

27:55.719 --> 27:59.019
PICTURE IT, THE WHISPER
OF FORBIDDEN PASSION.

27:59.222 --> 28:01.099
THE CLAMOR OF RACING HEARTBEATS,

28:01.308 --> 28:03.652
THE ROAR OF... DAVID, HOW MANY
OF THESE BOOKS HAVE YOU READ?

28:05.604 --> 28:07.106
I'M SO SORRY.

28:07.314 --> 28:09.567
ISN'T IT MAKING HER A STUDENT A BIT IFFY?

28:09.774 --> 28:11.151
YEAH, YEAH.

28:11.359 --> 28:13.236
WHAT IF SHE'S A JOURNALIST
SENT TO INTERVIEW

28:13.445 --> 28:14.571
THE HEADMASTER?

28:14.779 --> 28:16.326
WHO BECOMES HIS SEX SLAVE.

28:16.531 --> 28:18.829
OH, BRILLIANT, MARCUS, YOU'RE A NATURAL.

28:19.034 --> 28:22.379
GENTLEMEN, SHALL WE DO THIS?

28:22.579 --> 28:24.877
- WELL, I'M... I'M STILL...
- OF COURSE, YOU ARE.

28:25.081 --> 28:27.129
BUT JUST THINK, WHERE WILL WE PLAY DOMINOES

28:27.334 --> 28:28.426
IF THEY CLOSE THIS PLACE?

28:28.627 --> 28:32.177
COME ON. IT'S GOTTA BE WORTH A GO.

28:32.380 --> 28:36.010
ALL RIGHT, BUT I THINK WE
SHOULD ALL DO OUR OWN THING

28:36.218 --> 28:38.596
RATHER THAN TRY AND BE TOO UNIFIED.

28:38.803 --> 28:41.397
FROM WHAT I'VE READ, THERE
WON'T BE A PROBLEM OF STYLE.

28:41.640 --> 28:42.732
INDEED NOT.

28:42.933 --> 28:45.186
BUT THERE ARE RULES TO BE OBEYED.

28:45.393 --> 28:47.771
HE MUST HAVE A TRAGIC PAST,

28:47.979 --> 28:50.732
THUS LEGITIMIZING HIS PRESENT BEHAVIOR.

28:50.941 --> 28:53.410
SHE MUST USE A PET PHRASE AD NAUSEAM.

28:53.610 --> 28:56.284
SOMETHING LIKE, "OH, WOW,"

28:56.488 --> 28:59.412
TO REFLECT A CONSTANT QUIVERING EXCITEMENT.

28:59.616 --> 29:02.620
AND WE MUST CONTINUALLY MARVEL AT
THEIR ABILITY TO MATE AT WILL,

29:02.827 --> 29:04.170
LIKE A COUPLE OF FRENZIED RABBITS.

29:04.371 --> 29:07.796
AND IN PURELY PRACTICAL TERMS, NO E-MAILS.

29:07.999 --> 29:09.501
ONLY HARD COPIES.

29:11.419 --> 29:13.547
SORRY. OR MEMORY STICKS.

29:13.755 --> 29:15.348
NOBODY MUST KNOW ABOUT THIS.

29:41.199 --> 29:43.201
THANK YOU.

29:43.410 --> 29:47.165
NOW, MARCUS, IS MY BOOK READY?

29:47.372 --> 29:48.589
YES, IT IS.

29:54.921 --> 29:56.173
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- BAG.

30:59.277 --> 31:01.621
RED, PLEASE.

31:01.821 --> 31:03.198
THERE YOU ARE.

31:03.406 --> 31:04.703
- AH.
- WOULD YOU LIKE A CRISP POTATO?

31:04.908 --> 31:06.034
OH, NO, THANKS. I DON'T WANT...

31:06.242 --> 31:07.368
- HAVE A CRISP.
- I DON'T WANT TO.

31:07.577 --> 31:09.329
HAVE A CRISP.

31:32.936 --> 31:34.654
HELLO, ANDREW. JUST THAT ONE.

31:34.854 --> 31:36.447
SOLD A DICKENS ON EBAY.

31:50.829 --> 31:54.709
MR. ROSE, THIS
IS MATILDA, FROM BONAR AND LAW.

31:54.916 --> 31:59.387
CONFIRMING YOUR MEETING WITH
MISS LAW THIS THURSDAY.

31:59.587 --> 32:01.464
YOU WON'T BE LATE, WILL YOU?

32:21.776 --> 32:22.743
WHO IS IT?

32:22.944 --> 32:23.945
DAVID ROSE.

32:36.207 --> 32:39.507
AH, DAVID ROSE. I HAVE AN
APPOINTMENT WITH PEGGY LAW.

32:39.711 --> 32:41.213
OH, DEAR.

32:41.421 --> 32:43.469
I'LL SEE IF SHE'S READY.

32:47.760 --> 32:48.761
WHAT?

32:48.970 --> 32:50.517
MR. ROSE TO SEE YOU.

32:50.722 --> 32:54.067
WELL, SEND HIM IN.
I HAVEN'T GOT ALL DAY.

32:54.267 --> 32:55.564
SH E HAS, ACTUALLY.

32:58.313 --> 33:00.156
GOOD LUCK.

33:13.411 --> 33:17.757
WELL, SIT DOWN, MR. ROSE. I
CAN GIVE YOU FIVE MINUTES.

33:17.957 --> 33:20.255
THAT'S ALL I NEED, MISS LAW.

33:20.460 --> 33:22.383
I'M ONLY SEEING YOU BECAUSE
MY COLLEAGUE TELLS ME

33:22.587 --> 33:25.932
THAT YOU INTERVIEWED HIM ONCE ON
SOME HORRID LITTLE PROVINCIAL RAG.

33:26.132 --> 33:27.884
AND WERE NICE TO HIM,
WHICH HE'S NOT USED TO.

33:28.092 --> 33:29.594
HE'S VERY INTERESTING.

33:29.802 --> 33:33.648
NO, HE'S NOT, BUT HE HAS HIS USES.

33:33.848 --> 33:35.850
NOW, WHAT HAVE YOU WRITTEN?

33:36.059 --> 33:37.436
I'M NOT THE AUTHOR.

33:37.644 --> 33:39.817
I'M ACTING ON BEHALF OF
A YOUNG LADY I KNOW,

33:40.021 --> 33:42.945
- WHO'S VERY SHY.
- WHY?

33:43.149 --> 33:44.742
WELL, THE CONTENT OF THE BOOK IS,

33:44.943 --> 33:46.991
SHALL WE SAY, A LITTLE CONTENTIOUS.

33:47.195 --> 33:49.948
POLITICS, PERSONAL, OR PORN?

33:50.156 --> 33:52.750
PORN, MUMMY, PORN TO BE PRECISE.

33:52.951 --> 33:54.624
IS THIS GIRL A MUMMY?

33:54.827 --> 33:56.955
NO, BUT SHE'S WRITING FOR
A MARKET OF MUMMIES.

33:57.163 --> 33:58.665
IT'S REALLY QUITE A BIG DEMOGRAPHIC.

33:58.873 --> 34:01.126
MMM, I KNOW ALL ABOUT HOW BIG IT IS.

34:01.334 --> 34:03.962
WHAT I DON'T KNOW IS WHY
WOMEN DEMEAN THEMSELVES

34:04.170 --> 34:05.387
BY READING SUCH TRIPE.

34:05.588 --> 34:07.181
I'M NOT SURE I DO, TO BE HONEST.

34:07.382 --> 34:12.388
BUT, I SAID I'D HELP HER,
AND I THOUGHT BONAR AND LAW

34:12.594 --> 34:14.347
WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO START,

34:14.556 --> 34:16.524
IF YOU GET MY MEANING.

34:16.724 --> 34:18.192
GENERALLY IT'S ONLY THE YANKS

34:18.393 --> 34:21.818
WHO MAKES FOOLS OF THEMSELVES
WITH THE "BONER" JOKE.

34:22.021 --> 34:24.274
YES, SORRY.

34:24.482 --> 34:27.610
ANYWAY, WOULD YOU BE
PREPARED TO READ THE BOOK?

34:27.819 --> 34:29.786
- WHAT'S THE TITLE?
- "LOVE LET HER."

34:29.987 --> 34:32.992
- LOVE LETTER?
- NO, "LOVE LET HER"... ALLOWED HER.

34:33.199 --> 34:35.042
OH, DEAR, GOD. A WITTY TITLE.

34:35.243 --> 34:37.496
ABSOLUTELY.

34:37.704 --> 34:39.581
I MEANT THAT SARCASTICALLY.

34:41.791 --> 34:44.510
ALL RIGHT, I' LL READ IT. LEAVE
YOUR DETAILS WITH MATILDA,

34:44.710 --> 34:47.590
AND MAYBE YOU'LL HEAR
FROM US IN DUE COURSE.

34:47.797 --> 34:49.219
ANY IDEA WHEN?

34:52.260 --> 34:55.389
A LITTLE NUGGET OF ADVICE, MR. ROSE.

34:55.597 --> 34:58.441
IN THE LITERARY, INDEED, THE
ENTIRE ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS,

34:58.641 --> 35:01.019
THE ANSWER TO A QUESTION LIKE THAT IS NO.

35:01.227 --> 35:03.321
COMMUNICATION OF ANY KIND IS FROWNED UPON.

35:03.521 --> 35:06.570
ANSWERING EMAILS IS CONSIDERED
A SIGN OF WEAKNESS.

35:06.774 --> 35:10.495
INDEED, THE DEFAULT POSITION ON ANY
KIND OF COMMITMENT WHATSOEVER,

35:10.695 --> 35:13.494
IS SOME OTHER TIME.

35:15.158 --> 35:16.626
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE A VERY LUCKY FELLOW,

35:16.826 --> 35:19.875
BECAUSE STATISTICALLY THE
CHANCES OF YOUR GETTING

35:20.079 --> 35:22.628
A TEXT ON YOUR WAY TO SEE
ME CANCELING THIS MEETING,

35:22.832 --> 35:24.960
WAS ABOUT 70%.

35:27.545 --> 35:30.424
- GOOD AFTERNOON.
- GOOD AFTERNOON.

35:40.933 --> 35:44.062
NOW, YOU DON'T LIVE IN LONDON, DO YOU?

35:44.270 --> 35:46.693
QUITE A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T, AS IT HAPPENS.

35:46.898 --> 35:49.617
SILLY ME, OF COURSE THEY DON'T.

35:49.817 --> 35:51.945
IT MUST BE VERY NICE FOR YOU.

35:52.153 --> 35:53.621
IT IS.

36:07.418 --> 36:09.420
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

36:09.629 --> 36:12.178
- THE SHOW'S ABOUT TO START.
- SORRY, LOVE, I GOT HELD UP.

36:12.382 --> 36:13.634
WELL, DID YOU MEET YOUR CHUM?

36:13.841 --> 36:16.310
CHUM? OH, YES, YES, HE WAS ON GREAT FORM.

36:16.511 --> 36:19.481
GOOD OLD, ROBBIE. EXACTLY.

36:19.681 --> 36:20.728
- WHAT A LEGEND.
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

36:23.309 --> 36:25.607
WE'RE LEFT ALONE. ALL ALONE.

36:25.812 --> 36:29.612
WE HAVE TO START OVER.
BEGIN LIFE ALL OVER AGAIN.

36:29.816 --> 36:31.534
WE HAVE TO LIVE.

36:31.734 --> 36:33.657
WE HAVE TO LIVE.

36:33.861 --> 36:37.582
WE HAVE TO LIVE, LIVE, LIVE,
LIVE, LIVE, LIVE, LIVE.

36:37.782 --> 36:40.376
- WE HAVE TO WORK.
- WE HAVE TO LIVE...

36:40.576 --> 36:42.749
- LIVE, LIVE, LIVE.
- WE HAVE TO WORK,

36:42.954 --> 36:46.083
- WE HAVE TO WORK. WORK, WORK, WORK, WORK...
- LIVE, LIVE, LIVE, LIVE...

36:46.290 --> 36:47.792
- WE HAVE TO DIE.
- LIVE, LIVE, LIVE, LIVE...

36:48.000 --> 36:49.843
- WE HAVE TO DIE.
- WORK, WORK, WORK...

36:50.044 --> 36:51.762
- WE HAVE TO DIE...
- LIVE, LIVE, LIVE...

36:51.963 --> 36:53.590
- LIVE, LIVE, LIVE...
- DIE, DIE, DIE...

36:53.798 --> 36:57.553
TA-RA-RA BOOM-DE-AY, TA-RA-RA BOOM-DE-AY.

36:57.760 --> 37:01.606
TA-RA-RA BOOM-DE-AY, TA-RA-RA BOOM-DE-AY...

37:01.806 --> 37:03.774
- WE HAVE TO KNOW.
- TA-RA-RA BOOM-DE-AY...

37:03.975 --> 37:05.522
- WE HAVE TO KNOW.
- TA-RA-RA BOOM-DE-AY...

37:05.727 --> 37:08.105
- WE HAVE TO KNOW, KNOW, KNOW...
- TA-RA-RA BOOM-DE-AY...

37:08.312 --> 37:10.155
- KNOW, KNOW, KNOW, KNOW...
- TA-RA-RA BOOM-DE-AY...

37:10.356 --> 37:13.906
- KNOW, KNOW, KNOW, KNOW, KNOW!
- TA-RA-RA BOOM-DE-AY.

37:20.158 --> 37:23.082
WELL, THAT REALLY DOESN'T TAKE THE BISCUIT.

37:23.286 --> 37:26.130
MY TALENTED BABY SISTER.

37:26.330 --> 37:28.958
YES, VERY GOOD. WELL, DONE, SARAH.

37:29.167 --> 37:31.636
- OH, WELL DONE.
- DID YOU LIKE THE CONCEPT?

37:31.836 --> 37:33.258
VERY ORIGINAL.

37:33.463 --> 37:36.933
VERY, UM... I PARTICULARLY
LIKED "CHEBUTYKIN"

37:37.133 --> 37:38.180
IN THE WHEELCHAIR.

37:38.384 --> 37:39.852
THAT WAS A VERY GOOD...

37:42.013 --> 37:43.640
WASN'T SHE MARVELOUS?

37:43.890 --> 37:44.937
- YES.
- AND SO WERE YOU.

37:45.141 --> 37:46.734
OH, STOP IT.

37:46.934 --> 37:49.437
THANK YOU.

37:49.645 --> 37:50.988
WHAT CAN I GET YOU TO DRINK, SARAH?

37:51.189 --> 37:52.441
A BEER, PLEASE.

37:55.151 --> 37:56.448
HE DIDN'T LIKE IT, DID HE?

37:56.652 --> 37:58.746
WELL, I THINK HE WAS RATHER INTRIGUED.

37:58.946 --> 38:01.825
- AND YOU?
- YES, AND I WAS, TOO.

38:02.033 --> 38:03.785
ALTHOUGH, I HAVE TO BE HONEST.

38:03.993 --> 38:06.792
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT NATASHA
BEING TRANSSEXUAL.

38:06.996 --> 38:08.543
AND I SEEM TO RECALL THERE WERE CHILDREN

38:08.748 --> 38:10.716
IN THE ORIGINAL ONE.

38:10.917 --> 38:13.761
WELL, CHEKHOV REFERS TO
LOTS OF UNSEEN CHARACTERS.

38:13.961 --> 38:15.463
WE DECIDED IF YOU DON'T SEE THEM,

38:15.671 --> 38:18.720
- THEY DON'T EXIST.
- OH, RIGHT.

38:18.925 --> 38:22.304
HERE YOU ARE. ALL VERY
NOVEL AND INTERESTING.

38:22.512 --> 38:24.890
SO, I TAKE IT YOU'RE NOT BEING PAID.

38:25.097 --> 38:28.852
- WE'RE ON A PROFIT SHARE.
- OH, SO YOU'RE NOT BEING PAID.

38:29.060 --> 38:30.186
SHH.

38:30.394 --> 38:32.362
WELL, POSSIBLY. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, DAVID,

38:32.563 --> 38:37.285
I WOULD SOONER BE DOING
SOMETHING WORTHWHILE THAN...

38:37.485 --> 38:40.284
WELL, THAN EARNING MILLIONS
WRITING SHIT LIKE THIS.

38:40.488 --> 38:41.956
I'M WITH YOU THERE.

38:42.156 --> 38:44.158
NOW DON'T YOU START, ZOE.

38:44.367 --> 38:46.586
IT'S BAD ENOUGH HAVING "EVELYN
WAUGH" HERE MOANING AT ME.

38:46.786 --> 38:48.788
I DO HAVE OTHER INTERESTS, YOU KNOW.

38:48.996 --> 38:50.498
I'VE COME TO YOUR SHOW, HAVEN'T I?

38:50.706 --> 38:51.958
OF COURSE.

38:52.166 --> 38:55.841
- AND I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
- MMM.

38:56.045 --> 38:58.969
THE LADYBOY NATASHA WAS A CRAP IDEA.

38:59.173 --> 39:00.800
IT WASN'T VERY GOOD.

39:03.761 --> 39:05.729
THEY ALL WORKED VERY HARD.

39:05.930 --> 39:07.978
TOO HARD IN THE FIRST ACT.

39:08.182 --> 39:10.731
I COULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT
SEEING NATASHA'S BITS

39:10.935 --> 39:12.983
- IN SUCH GRAPHIC DETAIL.
- YES.

39:13.187 --> 39:15.531
ZOE DID EXPLAIN TO ME
ABOUT THE TRANNY THING,

39:15.731 --> 39:18.154
BUT IT DID RATHER GO OVER MY HEAD.

39:18.359 --> 39:20.157
WHEN THE DRESS WENT OVER HER/HIS HEAD,

39:20.361 --> 39:21.988
- THEY COULD HAVE KEPT HIS PANTS ON.
- YES.

39:22.196 --> 39:24.039
AND THEN "TIE ME UP AND TENDERIZE ME"?

39:24.240 --> 39:25.332
BLOODY HELL.

39:25.533 --> 39:27.752
IT DOES SEEM TO BE ALL THE RAGE.

39:27.952 --> 39:30.705
YOU KNOW, I WASN'T BEING
MEAN THE OTHER DAY.

39:30.913 --> 39:31.960
MEAN?

39:32.164 --> 39:33.837
YOU KNOW, WHEN I TALKED ABOUT YOUR BOOK.

39:34.041 --> 39:35.668
I JUST THINK YOU HAVE ONE IN YOU.

39:35.877 --> 39:37.595
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING YOU
COULD BE REALLY PROUD OF.

39:41.841 --> 39:43.935
DO YOU MIND IF I JUST PASS
IT DOWN INSIDE YOUR SHIRT?

39:44.135 --> 39:46.809
- WON'T TAKE A MOMENT.
- DON'T MIND AT ALL.

39:47.013 --> 39:48.981
TAKE ALL THE TIME YOU NEED.

40:00.109 --> 40:02.908
- ALL SET, MR. PAXMAN.
- THANK YOU, DARREN.

40:03.112 --> 40:05.706
READY, GEOFFREY?

40:05.907 --> 40:07.454
OH.

40:10.494 --> 40:11.746
WHAT THE BLOODY HELL IS THAT?

40:11.954 --> 40:14.002
ACTION.

40:14.206 --> 40:16.300
I'M TALKING TO GEOFFREY CLAREY,

40:16.500 --> 40:18.673
CO-OWNER OF AN ENDANGERED SPECIES,

40:18.878 --> 40:20.551
AN INDEPENDENT BOOKSHOP.

40:20.755 --> 40:22.223
THIS LOOKS REALLY GOOD.

40:22.423 --> 40:24.517
DARREN, DARREN, WE CAN HEAR YOU.

40:24.717 --> 40:28.563
- OH, YEAH, SORRY.
- CONCENTRATE.

40:28.763 --> 40:32.688
TELL ME, GEOFFREY, AS A MAN WHO I
ASSUME LOVES GREAT LITERATURE,

40:32.892 --> 40:35.611
WHAT DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THE PROLIFERATION

40:35.811 --> 40:38.234
OF WHAT IS TERMED "MUMMY PORN"?

40:38.439 --> 40:41.033
WELL, WE ARE INDEED, AS YOU SAY, DAVID,

40:41.233 --> 40:43.235
ENDANGERED, SO I HAVE TO SAY I WELCOME IT.

40:43.444 --> 40:44.912
WE SELL A LOT OF THESE BOOKS.

40:45.112 --> 40:47.956
BUT SURELY YOU CAN'T
APPROVE OF THE TOTAL LACK

40:48.157 --> 40:49.955
OF LITERARY MERIT IN THE WRITING?

40:50.159 --> 40:51.877
WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF I APPROVE OR NOT.

40:52.078 --> 40:53.375
I'M IN BUSINESS TO SELL BOOKS.

40:53.579 --> 40:54.751
AS LONG AS THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY BREAKING

40:54.956 --> 40:56.833
ANY OBSCENITY LAWS, I WILL SELL THEM.

40:57.041 --> 40:59.464
WELL, SURELY, THEY ARE OBSCENE, THOUGH.

40:59.669 --> 41:01.421
WE'RE PRETTY OPEN-MINDED
IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD.

41:01.629 --> 41:03.006
OH, OF COURSE.

41:03.214 --> 41:04.386
YES, ALTHOUGH I WOULD SAY...

41:04.590 --> 41:07.013
I'M SO SORRY, GEOFFREY.

41:07.218 --> 41:09.937
- OH, I HAVE TO TAKE THIS.
- PLEASE.

41:10.137 --> 41:11.309
SORRY.

41:11.514 --> 41:13.733
- DAVID ROSE.
- I HAVE MISS LAW FOR YOU.

41:13.933 --> 41:16.277
OH, SILLY ME. DARREN, I
THINK YOU MIGHT NEED

41:16.477 --> 41:18.229
TO READJUST MY MICROPHONE.

41:18.437 --> 41:22.567
MR. ROSE, I
READ YOUR PROTEGE'S EFFORT

41:22.775 --> 41:26.825
AND I THINK IT MIGHT
JUST BE WORTH TAKING ON.

41:27.029 --> 41:29.077
MIND YOU, THERE'S SOMETHING ODD ABOUT IT.

41:29.281 --> 41:31.375
- ODD?
- CAN'T QUITE PUT MY FINGER ON IT,

41:31.575 --> 41:35.330
BUT I'VE GIVEN IT TO MR. BONAR TO PERUSE.

41:35.538 --> 41:37.131
ANYWAY, I'LL HAVE A CHAT
WITH SOME PUBLISHERS

41:37.331 --> 41:38.878
AND WE'LL NEED TO SORT OUT A CONTRACT

41:39.083 --> 41:41.302
WITH THIS MYSTERIOUS AUTHOR OF YOURS.

41:41.502 --> 41:43.470
IF SHE WANTS YOU TO ACT FOR HER,

41:43.671 --> 41:46.220
WE'LL NEED HER TO SIGN POWER
OF ATTORNEY OVER TO YOU.

41:46.424 --> 41:47.926
I TAKE IT THAT WON'T BE A PROBLEM?

41:48.134 --> 41:52.059
- NO PROBLEM AT ALL.
- GOOD.

41:52.263 --> 41:54.516
I'LL BE IN TOUCH.

41:54.724 --> 41:58.024
SORRY ABOUT THAT. I'M SORRY, DARREN.

41:58.227 --> 42:00.229
I THINK WE CAN CARRY ON.

42:00.438 --> 42:03.191
ALTHOUGH, IT MIGHT BE NICE
IF MARCUS COULD SORT OF FLIT

42:03.399 --> 42:04.446
BACK AND FORTH BEHIND ME.

42:04.650 --> 42:06.072
MAKE THE PLACE LOOK A LITTLE BUSIER.

42:06.277 --> 42:09.577
WOULD YOU MIND FLOATING?

42:09.780 --> 42:11.032
READY?

42:19.832 --> 42:23.211
WHAT WERE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS BOOK?

42:23.419 --> 42:25.797
WELL, IT'S TRIPE, OF COURSE.

42:26.005 --> 42:27.757
BUT TRIPE THAT'LL KEEP US IN <i>FOIE GRAS</i>

42:27.965 --> 42:30.013
IN THE FORESEEABLE IF I'M ANY JUDGE.

42:30.217 --> 42:33.312
IT DOES HAVE AN ODD
CONSTRUCTION, DON'T YOU THINK?

42:33.512 --> 42:36.015
WELL, YES, IT DOES.

42:36.223 --> 42:39.147
IT'S ALMOST AS IF THE
HEROINE, OR THE VICTIM,

42:39.351 --> 42:42.104
DEPENDING ON HOW YOU SEE IT,
HAS A SPLIT PERSONALITY.

42:46.442 --> 42:48.740
SPLIT FOUR WAYS.

42:48.944 --> 42:52.118
THERE'S A SORT OF SLIGHTLY POETIC ELEMENT.

42:52.323 --> 42:54.951
AND THEN, OF COURSE, SOME OF IT IS...

43:02.958 --> 43:04.551
QUITE FUNNY.

43:04.752 --> 43:07.130
THE FETISH STUFF IN THE SCHOOL GYM

43:07.338 --> 43:11.138
IS NOT EXACTLY AS I REMEMBER PT.

43:11.342 --> 43:15.848
AND AS FOR THE STRAIGHT SEX,

43:16.055 --> 43:17.853
WELL, IT ISN'T, IS II'?

43:18.057 --> 43:20.936
- STRAIGHT, I MEAN.
- DON'T ASK ME.

43:21.143 --> 43:24.943
IF I WERE TO SHACKLE MRS. BONAR

43:25.147 --> 43:29.869
TO THE ORTHOPEDIC BED, THERE VERY
SOON WOULDN'T BE A MR. BONAR.

43:30.069 --> 43:34.620
ANYWAY, <i>"FORTIS FORTUNA ADIUVAT."</i>

43:34.824 --> 43:38.874
AND WE COULD BE SET TO MAKE OUR FORTUNE.

43:39.078 --> 43:41.547
LET'S CELEBRATE. I'LL BUY YOU LUNCH.

43:41.747 --> 43:46.469
IF YOU INSIST, BUT <i>"NE QUID NIMIS."</i>

43:46.669 --> 43:48.592
YES, I SEE.

43:48.796 --> 43:50.969
NO, NO, PEGGY, OLD GIRL,

43:51.173 --> 43:54.177
I'M SORRY, BUT WE ARE ABOUT TO ENTER

43:54.385 --> 43:58.982
A WHOLE NEW WORLD OF EXCESS.

43:59.223 --> 44:02.523
I ONLY HOPE THAT THE OLD
TICKER WILL STAND IT.

44:02.726 --> 44:06.151
BY THE WAY, I'VE GOT THOSE BOOKS OF YOURS.

44:06.355 --> 44:07.322
I'M DONE WITH THE RESEARCH.

44:07.523 --> 44:09.241
KEEP THEM HID, DARLING.

44:09.441 --> 44:11.068
IN FACT, I DON'T WANT THEM BACK.

44:11.277 --> 44:12.745
I THINK I HAD ENOUGH OF THIS STUFF NOW.

44:12.945 --> 44:14.538
JUST TAKE THEM TO THE
CHARITY SHOP, WOULD YOU?

44:14.738 --> 44:17.537
NO, I WON'T. I HAVE A
REPUTATION TO SAFEGUARD.

44:17.741 --> 44:19.118
OH, DON'T BE SUCH A PRUDE.

44:19.326 --> 44:21.078
THE OLD DEARS AT THE SHOP
WILL BE VERY EXCITED.

44:21.287 --> 44:25.588
NOW THAT'S A SCARY THOUGHT.

44:25.791 --> 44:29.045
DO THEY MAKE YOU EXCITED?

44:29.253 --> 44:30.755
WHAT, THE OLD DEARS?

44:30.963 --> 44:33.182
NO, NO, I MEAN THE BOOKS.

44:33.382 --> 44:36.010
DO YOU GET TURNED ON?

44:36.218 --> 44:38.346
WHAT, DO YOU GET TURNED ON BY ONLINE PORN?

44:38.554 --> 44:40.397
I NEVER WATCH PORN.

44:40.598 --> 44:42.942
WELL, THEN YOU'RE PART OF A
VERY EXCLUSIVE MALE MINORITY.

44:43.142 --> 44:46.362
ALL RIGHT, WERE I TO WATCH
PORN, WHICH I DON'T,

44:46.562 --> 44:50.157
I PROBABLY WOULD... GET TURNED ON, I MEAN.

44:50.357 --> 44:52.359
BUT IT'S NOT AS GOOD AS THE REAL THING.

44:52.568 --> 44:54.161
EXACTLY. IT'S A CASE OF "WELL, I NEVER?

44:54.361 --> 44:56.238
RATHER THAN "WELL, I MUST."

44:56.447 --> 44:58.370
I DON'T ACTUALLY WANT YOU TO TIE
ME TO THE BED AND SPANK ME,

44:58.574 --> 45:00.417
BUT IT'S QUITE FUN TO IMAGINE IT.

45:02.661 --> 45:05.414
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THE
DESSERT MENU, MRS. ROSE?

45:05.623 --> 45:07.500
YES, YES, PLEASE.

45:07.708 --> 45:11.633
NOW SEE WHAT YOU'VE MADE ME DO?
I KNOW HIS MOTHER.

45:11.837 --> 45:13.464
ANYWAY, I DON'T WANT THE BOOKS BACK.

45:13.672 --> 45:15.674
AND I EXPECT THAT GOES FOR
A LOT OF OTHER WOMEN.

45:15.883 --> 45:18.227
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- WELL, IT'S PROBABLY A FAD.

45:18.427 --> 45:21.601
TOMORROW IT'LL BE GARDENING MAGAZINES.
NEXT WEEK, PLUMBING MANUALS.

45:21.805 --> 45:23.933
BUT SURELY, THERE WILL ALWAYS BE
A MARKET FOR THIS SORT OF THING.

45:24.141 --> 45:26.109
- YOU SOUND LIKE YOU CARE.
- OF COURSE NOT.

45:26.310 --> 45:30.156
BUT SURELY PEOPLE WILL
ALWAYS READ ROMANTIC NOVELS.

45:30.356 --> 45:32.233
OH, WELL, YOU GO AHEAD.
DON'T LET ME STOP YOU

45:32.441 --> 45:33.784
COMMUNING WITH YOUR INNER BARBARA CARTLAND

45:33.984 --> 45:36.157
WHENEVER YOU FEEL THE NEED TO.

45:36.362 --> 45:39.411
NICK CLEGG, "MY LIFE IN
POLITICS," WE'LL TAKE ONE.

45:39.615 --> 45:42.243
YOU NEVER KNOW. OH, AND WE'RE GONNA NEED

45:42.451 --> 45:45.000
10 COPIES OF THE NEW LYDIA LOVEMORE.

45:45.204 --> 45:46.205
THAT'S IT. THANKS.

45:46.413 --> 45:47.335
SPEAK SOON.

45:49.375 --> 45:53.346
WHAT'S WRONG WITH "CONDUCT UNBECOMING"?

45:53.545 --> 45:55.798
- APART FROM THE OBVIOUS?
- I DON'T KNOW.

45:56.006 --> 45:57.758
MAYBE SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE
BROUGHT THE SEQUEL OUT

45:57.967 --> 45:59.935
THREE MONTHS AFTER THE FIRST ONE.

46:00.135 --> 46:01.637
OR MAYBE THE BUBBLE'S BURSTING.

46:01.845 --> 46:04.223
DAMN IT.

46:04.473 --> 46:06.066
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE PLEASED.

46:06.267 --> 46:08.816
FEWER SALES MEANS LESS MONEY.

46:09.019 --> 46:10.316
THAT'S NEVER BOTHERED YOU BEFORE NOW.

46:10.521 --> 46:13.741
WELL, I TOLD YOU. I WANT
THE SHOP TO SURVIVE.

46:13.941 --> 46:16.865
DO YOU HAVE A COPY OF
"CONDUCT UNBECOMING" PLEASE?

46:17.069 --> 46:21.825
UH, YES, I'VE GOT ONE COPY LEFT.

46:22.032 --> 46:25.787
ALL I'M SAYING IS HE DON'T HAVE THE
RIGHT TO PRETEND THESE THINGS.

46:25.995 --> 46:27.793
HE SAY HIS CARROTS ARE ORGANIC,

46:27.997 --> 46:29.749
BUT WHO KNOWS THAT HE AREN'T
COVERING THEM WITH SHIT

46:29.957 --> 46:32.380
- AND CALLING THEM ORGANIC?
- WELL, I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN.

46:32.584 --> 46:36.964
AND, DON'T QUOTE ME ON THIS,
BUT I TELL YOU, HE IS A TWO...

46:37.172 --> 46:39.595
EXCUSE ME.

46:39.800 --> 46:40.926
DAVID ROSE.

46:41.135 --> 46:43.058
MR. ROSE, I HOPE YOU'RE SITTING DOWN

46:43.262 --> 46:45.230
OR AT LEAST SOMEWHERE WHERE
YOU CAN FAINT AT LIBERTY.

46:45.431 --> 46:48.310
NOT EASY, BUT FIRE AWAY.

46:48.517 --> 46:49.689
WE HAVE A DEAL.

46:49.893 --> 46:53.363
FOR "LOVE LET HER."

46:53.564 --> 46:55.441
A MAJOR PUBLISHER, NOT UNCONNECTED

46:55.649 --> 46:58.152
WITH "FLIGHTLESS BIRDS WHO
LIVE IN THE ANTARCTIC,"

46:58.360 --> 47:01.364
- IS PROPOSING AN ADVANCE.
- THAT'S TERRIFIC.

47:01.572 --> 47:04.041
NOT IN THE SAME LEAGUE AS
"LYDIA LOVEBITE," I'M AFRAID.

47:04.241 --> 47:06.710
BUT I DARE SAY HALF A
MILLION WILL BE ACCEPTABLE.

47:06.910 --> 47:11.086
AFTER COMMISSION AND TAX,
THAT'S ABOUT, OH, 300,000?

47:11.290 --> 47:12.758
300,000?

47:12.958 --> 47:14.380
I'LL HAVE TO CONSULT WITH
THE AUTHOR, OF COURSE,

47:14.585 --> 47:17.054
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE THAT
WILL BE MORE THAN FINE.

47:17.254 --> 47:19.177
WELL, YOU'LL HAVE TO DO MORE
THAN CONSULT, I'M AFRAID.

47:19.381 --> 47:22.100
WITH MONEY LIKE THAT, WE'LL NEED
HER SIGNATURE, AND NOT YOURS.

47:22.301 --> 47:25.726
THE ONLY STIPULATION THAT
THE PUBLISHERS HAVE MADE

47:25.929 --> 47:29.229
IS THAT THE AUTHOR COMMIT HERSELF
TO A FULL-SCALE PRESS CAMPAIGN.

47:29.433 --> 47:31.652
I'M NOT SURE THAT SHE'D BE ABLE TO...

47:31.852 --> 47:34.196
YOU PERSUADED ME TO READ
HER HORRID LITTLE BOOK,

47:34.396 --> 47:36.740
NOW YOU PERSUADE HER TO ACCEPT THE TERMS

47:36.940 --> 47:38.613
OR IT'S A DEAL BREAKER, I'M AFRAID.

47:38.817 --> 47:43.744
JUST REMIND THE GIRL THAT ANY
PUBLICITY IS GOOD PUBLICITY.

47:43.947 --> 47:45.995
ANY PUBLICITY IS GOOD PUBLICITY.

47:46.200 --> 47:47.952
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY, ISN'T IT?

47:48.160 --> 47:50.709
NOW, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO SAY?

47:50.913 --> 47:52.256
I HAVEN'T A FUCKING CLUE.

47:59.546 --> 48:02.299
YES.

48:02.508 --> 48:03.634
SHIT.

48:06.929 --> 48:09.682
I'M SO SORRY, LADY FERMLEY-CADWALLER.

48:09.890 --> 48:11.233
YES!

48:11.433 --> 48:13.686
SHIT.

48:13.894 --> 48:15.111
I'M SORRY.

48:15.312 --> 48:18.782
HORSE WON, THEN STEWARD'S INQUIRY.

48:18.982 --> 48:20.404
YES.

48:23.320 --> 48:25.368
SHIT.

48:25.572 --> 48:29.793
SORRY. DISREGARD THAT
UNFORTUNATE OUTBURST.

48:29.993 --> 48:32.712
- EVEN IF WE DID OWN UP...
- WHICH WE CAN'T.

48:32.913 --> 48:35.462
IF WE DID, THEY'RE NOT
GOING TO GO FOR MUMMY PORN

48:35.666 --> 48:37.134
WRITTEN BY FOUR BLOKES.

48:37.334 --> 48:39.211
THERE MUST BE A WAY TO PERSUADE THEM

48:39.420 --> 48:42.264
THAT IT'S MORE INTERESTING TO
HAVE A MYSTERIOUS SECRET WRITER.

48:42.464 --> 48:45.718
ACTUALLY, IT'S PROBABLY FOR THE BEST.

48:45.926 --> 48:47.428
THE BOOK WOULD HAVE FLOPPED ANYWAY.

48:47.636 --> 48:49.058
THE BUBBLE'S BURST.

48:49.263 --> 48:51.061
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
WE'D HAVE HAD THE MONEY

48:51.306 --> 48:52.353
HOWEVER IT SOLD.

48:52.558 --> 48:56.563
300 GRAND TO THE PENNY.

48:56.770 --> 48:58.647
- YOUR GO.
- BEEN.

48:58.856 --> 49:00.358
OH.

49:00.566 --> 49:02.068
LAST DOMINO.

49:05.362 --> 49:06.830
YOU LOST AGAIN.

49:07.030 --> 49:10.500
- EVERY WHICH WAY.
- OH, THAT SOUNDS SERIOUS.

49:10.701 --> 49:13.329
NOT REALLY, BUT, I'M GOING TO GO TO BED.

49:13.537 --> 49:15.335
- AREN'T YOU HUNGRY?
- NO.

49:15.539 --> 49:18.543
- ARE YOU ILL?
- NO.

49:18.750 --> 49:22.721
DO YOU KNOW ANY WORDS WITH
MORE THAN ONE SYLLABLE?

49:22.921 --> 49:25.219
HOW MUCH OF A DISAPPOINTMENT AM I TO YOU?

49:25.424 --> 49:27.722
OH, YOU SILLY BOY.

49:27.926 --> 49:29.849
WHAT ARE YOU ON ABOUT?

49:30.053 --> 49:32.852
I'M A SMALL-TOWN JOURNALIST.

49:33.056 --> 49:34.683
I'LL PROBABLY NEVER WRITE THAT NOVEL,

49:34.892 --> 49:36.018
BECAUSE BY THE TIME I'M READY...

49:36.226 --> 49:37.478
BY THE TIME THE CHILDREN ARE OLD ENOUGH,

49:37.686 --> 49:39.154
I SHALL BE ITCHING TO TURN THE GARDEN,

49:39.354 --> 49:40.822
AND YOU CAN GET BUSY WITH THE NOVEL.

49:41.023 --> 49:42.946
ANYWAY, YOU'RE WRITING NOW, AREN'T YOU?

49:43.150 --> 49:44.527
- WHAT?
- WRITING.

49:44.735 --> 49:46.237
YOU DO IT EVERY DAY.

49:46.445 --> 49:47.571
OH, THAT.

49:47.779 --> 49:50.498
- YES, I SUPPOSE SO.
- WELL, THEN.

49:50.699 --> 49:52.326
BUT IF I'D WANTED TO MARRY A NOVELIST

49:52.534 --> 49:54.582
THERE WERE PLENTY TO CHOOSE FROM AT UNY.

49:54.786 --> 49:57.209
TROUBLE IS, NONE OF THEM MADE ME LAUGH.

49:57.414 --> 49:58.631
SO THAT'S ALL I DO FOR YOU?

49:58.832 --> 50:02.177
NO, YOU MAKE HAPPY, YOU MAUDLIN FOOL.

50:02.377 --> 50:04.004
AND I DON'T EVEN MIND YOU PLAYING DOMINOES.

50:04.213 --> 50:05.590
ALTHOUGH IF YOU EVER GRADUATE TO DARTS,

50:05.797 --> 50:08.846
I SHALL DIVORCE YOU. NOW GO TO BED.

50:09.051 --> 50:10.974
AND IF YOU'RE VERY GOOD,

50:11.178 --> 50:14.307
I'LL BRING YOU A CHOCOLATE
DIGESTIVE WITH YOUR MORNING TEA.

50:14.515 --> 50:17.268
OH, BY THE WAY, ZOE'S
COMING TO STAY TOMORROW.

50:17.476 --> 50:21.231
- HOW LONG FOR?
- AS LONG AS SHE LIKES OR NEEDS.

50:21.438 --> 50:24.533
I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT HER. SHE
SOUNDED SO DOWN ON THE PHONE TODAY.

50:24.733 --> 50:28.488
SUPPOSE I'D BETTER TRY AND
MAKE HER LAUGH, THEN.

50:28.695 --> 50:30.823
THAT WOULD BE GOOD.

50:36.203 --> 50:38.376
I'M SORRY, MATE, BUT THE
NUMBERS JUST DON'T ADD UP.

50:38.580 --> 50:40.582
OKAY, WELL, THANKS ANYWAY.

50:45.546 --> 50:47.799
HEY, YOU'RE ZOE, AREN'T YOU?

50:48.006 --> 50:49.178
JEN'S SISTER.

50:49.383 --> 50:51.636
UH, YEAH, I'M ZOE.

50:51.843 --> 50:53.561
WE'VE MET IN THE PUB LAST YEAR.

50:53.762 --> 50:56.311
CHRIS. THE MANAGER.

50:56.515 --> 50:58.734
OH, YEAH, YEAH, OF COURSE. SORRY.

50:58.934 --> 51:00.277
YEAH, NO PROB. SO, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING UP HERE?

51:00.477 --> 51:01.854
I THOUGHT YOU LIVED IN LONDON.

51:02.062 --> 51:03.279
UH, YEAH, I DID. I MEAN, I DO.

51:03.480 --> 51:05.198
BUT I HAVE A THING I NEED TO DO UP HERE.

51:05.399 --> 51:06.742
ACTUALLY, I'M RUNNING A LITTLE BIT LATE.

51:06.942 --> 51:09.991
SURE, WELL, MAYBE YOU'LL
COME TO THE PUB AGAIN.

51:10.195 --> 51:11.538
WE'RE ALWAYS OPEN.

51:11.738 --> 51:15.333
OBVIOUSLY NOT ALWAYS, BUT
WE'RE OPEN DURING...

51:15.534 --> 51:18.754
- OPENING HOURS?
- YEAH.

51:18.954 --> 51:21.173
IT WAS NICE TO SEE YOU.

51:25.752 --> 51:28.050
STOP FOR A CHAT, SON?

51:28.255 --> 51:29.848
UH, NO.

51:30.048 --> 51:31.391
WELL, FUCK OFF OUT OF THE WAY THEN.

51:31.592 --> 51:33.060
GO ON.

51:36.513 --> 51:39.062
I'M AFRAID WE HAVEN'T GOT GOOD NEWS.

51:39.266 --> 51:40.768
WELL, AS YOU KNOW, WE WERE OPTIMISTIC

51:40.976 --> 51:43.195
THAT CHANGING YOUR MEDICATION

51:43.395 --> 51:46.649
WOULD BE OF SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT,

51:46.857 --> 51:51.613
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU, IT
APPEARS NOT TO BE THE CASE.

51:52.779 --> 51:54.281
MEANING?

51:54.489 --> 51:58.494
THERE'S NOT MUCH MORE WE CAN DO.

51:58.702 --> 52:02.548
BUT I DON'T WANT TO...

52:02.748 --> 52:04.750
WELL...

52:04.958 --> 52:08.087
UM, WELL, OF COURSE WE CAN RUN MORE TESTS.

52:08.295 --> 52:09.547
HOW LONG?

52:09.755 --> 52:12.099
I'VE ORGANIZED FOR SOMEONE TO HELP YOU.

52:12.299 --> 52:13.471
THEY'RE VERY SKILLFUL AND SUPPORTIVE.

52:13.675 --> 52:18.101
HOW LONG?

52:18.305 --> 52:20.854
SIX MONTHS.

52:21.058 --> 52:22.184
MAYBE NINE.

52:32.152 --> 52:36.373
HOW ARE YOU? YOU SOUNDED
SO MISERABLE ON THE PHONE.

52:36.573 --> 52:38.746
BLOODY CRITICS.

52:38.950 --> 52:40.827
WOULD YOU LIKE A DRINK, ZOE?
WE'RE HAVING A G&T.

52:41.036 --> 52:42.288
OH, YES, PLEASE.

52:42.496 --> 52:43.918
MAKE IT A QUADRUPLE. I'M KNACKERED.

52:44.122 --> 52:46.671
I'VE BEEN CRYING ALL DAY.

52:46.875 --> 52:48.843
OH, SURELY, IT'S NOT THAT BAD.

52:49.044 --> 52:50.387
YOU SHOULD HAVE COME EARLIER.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

52:50.587 --> 52:52.385
THE HOSPITAL.

52:52.589 --> 52:54.341
GOD, WHAT'S HAPPENED?

52:54.549 --> 52:56.893
BAD NEWS.

52:57.094 --> 52:59.267
BREAKING BAD NEWS.

52:59.471 --> 53:02.350
24, WELL, NO, 23 TIMES...
ONE OF THEM DIDN'T TURN UP.

53:02.557 --> 53:06.232
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

53:06.436 --> 53:08.313
ROLE PLAY.

53:08.522 --> 53:10.616
OH, I'M SORRY. DIDN'T I TELL YOU?

53:10.816 --> 53:14.195
WHEN THE PLAY CLOSED, I GOT A COUPLE
OF DAYS' WORK UP HERE DOING ROLE PLAY.

53:14.403 --> 53:16.451
IT'S EASIER TOMORROW. WE'RE DOING BIPOLAR.

53:16.655 --> 53:20.705
OH, THANK GOD. YOU GOT
ME REALLY WORRIED THEN.

53:20.909 --> 53:22.456
- MMM.
- WHEN'S SUPPER?

53:22.661 --> 53:26.006
ALL THAT CRYING HAS REALLY
TAKEN IT OUT OF ME.

53:26.206 --> 53:27.799
- 50...
- IF I EVER GET A FILM ROLE,

53:27.999 --> 53:29.626
AND THEY WANT ME TO CRY,

53:29.835 --> 53:32.179
AT LEAST THEY WON'T HAVE TO
SQUIRT ANYTHING IN MY EYES.

53:32.379 --> 53:34.097
I'M AN EXPERT NOW.

53:42.097 --> 53:45.192
DAVID. WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU
DOING SKULKING ABOUT HERE?

53:45.392 --> 53:46.644
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

53:46.852 --> 53:48.399
BUT I'M ON MY WAY BACK TO YOUR PLACE.

53:48.603 --> 53:51.607
PRIVATELY. COME ON.

53:51.815 --> 53:55.445
SO, WHAT'S ALL THIS
CLOAK-AND-DAGGER STUFF THEN?

53:55.652 --> 53:57.370
I HAVE A PROPOSITION FOR YOU.

53:57.571 --> 53:59.619
I HOPE THAT'S NOT AS PERVY AS IT SOUNDS.

53:59.823 --> 54:01.120
GOOD GOD, NO.

54:01.324 --> 54:03.076
OH, WHAT, I'M NOT SEXY ENOUGH FOR YOU?

54:03.285 --> 54:04.628
NO.

54:04.870 --> 54:06.213
I MEAN, YES, BUT, NO.

54:06.413 --> 54:08.791
"OH, YES, BUT NO, BUT
YES, BUT NO," BUT WHAT?

54:08.999 --> 54:10.922
I'M LOOKING TO HIRE YOU.

54:11.084 --> 54:13.507
DAVID, THAT'S MORE INSULTING
THAN NOT FANCYING ME.

54:13.712 --> 54:15.555
I MEAN, I WANT TO ENGAGE
YOU FOR SOME ROLE PLAY.

54:15.756 --> 54:19.511
JESUS, DAVID, ARE WE TALKING
WHIPS AND OBEDIENCE HERE?

54:19.718 --> 54:22.471
OF COURSE NOT. ALTHOUGH
THERE IS A CONNECTION.

54:22.679 --> 54:25.228
BUT BEFORE I GO ON, YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME

54:25.432 --> 54:26.854
THAT WHETHER OR NOT YOU ACCEPT MY OFFER,

54:27.058 --> 54:28.981
YOU WON'T BREATHE A WORD OF THIS TO ANYONE,

54:29.186 --> 54:31.484
PARTICULARLY NOT TO JEN.

54:31.688 --> 54:33.656
GETS CURIOUSER AND CURIOUSER.

54:33.857 --> 54:36.406
DO YOU PROMISE?

54:36.610 --> 54:38.237
BROWNIE'S HONOR.

54:38.445 --> 54:39.788
AND YOU'RE TALKING TO THE
GAL WHO'LL TAKE THE SECRET

54:39.988 --> 54:41.740
OF BROWNELL'S CANNABIS PLANTS TO HER GRAVE.

54:43.325 --> 54:45.953
WHY THE CLANDESTINE MEETING?

54:46.161 --> 54:48.539
WELL, I ASSUME ASHENDEN WILL
TELL US IF HE TURNS UP.

54:48.747 --> 54:51.796
HEY?

54:51.958 --> 54:54.507
I ASSUME MARCUS IS MAKING
AN IRONIC REFERENCE

54:54.711 --> 54:57.430
TO JOHN ASHENDEN, SUBJECT OF A SERIES

54:57.631 --> 54:59.599
OF SHORT STORIES BY SOMERSET MAUGHAM.

54:59.800 --> 55:01.393
HOW FASCINATING. PLEASE TELL ME MORE.

55:01.593 --> 55:04.096
WELL, ASHENDEN WAS A FIRST WORLD WAR SPY.

55:04.304 --> 55:05.931
OH, BOLLOCKS.

55:06.139 --> 55:08.141
SORRY, GUYS. WHEN YOU GET GOING
IT REALLY FREAKS ME OUT.

55:08.350 --> 55:11.479
I GUESS THIS SOMERSET GUY DIDN'T
WRITE EROTIC WOMEN'S STORIES.

55:11.686 --> 55:14.986
NO, OH, WELL, ACTUALLY, THERE
WAS "LIZA OF LAMBETH."

55:15.190 --> 55:16.567
- "CAKES AND ALES."
- SHUT UP.

55:17.776 --> 55:19.369
OH.

55:19.569 --> 55:21.913
GENTLEMEN, I WANT YOU TO MEET

55:22.113 --> 55:25.492
THE AUTHOR OF "LOVE LET HER."

55:25.700 --> 55:27.168
ZOE FIELDER.

55:34.334 --> 55:35.677
HAVE YOU GONE MAD?

55:35.877 --> 55:37.720
NEVER SANER, AS I WILL EXPLAIN.

55:37.921 --> 55:40.344
PLEASE DO.

55:40.549 --> 55:45.020
WHEN PUBS DISAPPEAR THEY
NEVER COME BACK, RIGHT?

55:45.220 --> 55:48.064
WE CAN SAVE OUR HALLOWES INSTITUTION.
ALL WE NEED IS AN AUTHOR,

55:48.265 --> 55:51.769
AND ZOE HERE, WHO HAPPENS
TO BE MY SISTER-IN-LAW,

55:51.977 --> 55:55.607
IS AN ACTRESS, WHO DOES LOTS
OF WHAT THEY CALL ROLE PLAY.

55:55.814 --> 55:58.738
THIS WILL BE HER GREATEST ROLE.

55:58.942 --> 56:01.195
WELL, I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT.

56:01.403 --> 56:02.996
GREATEST ROLE PLAY THEN.

56:03.196 --> 56:05.870
WE'LL PAY ZOE FOR THE TIME
SHE HAS TO BE OUR WRITER,

56:06.074 --> 56:08.543
PROBABLY ABOUT THREE MONTHS
UNTIL THE FUSS DIES DOWN.

56:08.743 --> 56:13.123
WE GET THE 300 GRAND,
MINUS WHAT WE PAY ZOE.

56:13.331 --> 56:15.004
- I THINK IT'S TOO RISKY.
- SO DO I.

56:15.208 --> 56:16.130
WELL, EXPLAIN WHY.

56:16.334 --> 56:18.132
WELL, SUPPOSING SHE'S UNMASKED.

56:18.336 --> 56:19.508
SHE'S NOT A BLOODY SPY.

56:19.713 --> 56:21.431
I DON'T MEAN TO BE RUDE,
ZOE, BUT WHAT IF SHE DOES

56:21.631 --> 56:23.599
- TELL ANYBODY?
- SHE'S JEN'S SISTER.

56:23.800 --> 56:25.552
SHE'S FAMILY.

56:25.760 --> 56:28.058
BUT ANYWAY, WE'LL BE PAYING HER.
SHE CAN SIGN A CONTRACT.

56:28.263 --> 56:30.265
YOU WOULDN'T MIND THAT, WOULD YOU, ZOE?

56:30.473 --> 56:33.022
NO, BUT I DO MIND MY DEAL.

56:33.226 --> 56:35.194
YOU DIDN'T MENTION WHAT YOU WERE MAKING.

56:35.395 --> 56:36.738
AND I HAVE TO SORT THE TAX OUT.

56:36.938 --> 56:38.440
MY ACCOUNTANT CAN DO THAT.

56:38.648 --> 56:42.619
AND ALL THAT'S LEFT IS GOING
TOWARD SAVING THE PUB.

56:42.819 --> 56:45.288
400 A WEEK? STILL PRETTY CRAP.

56:45.488 --> 56:46.489
IT IS, ACTUALLY.

56:46.698 --> 56:49.167
FINE, WE'LL MAKE IT 500.

56:49.367 --> 56:51.916
WHICH IS 490 POUNDS MORE
THAN YOU WERE GETTING

56:52.120 --> 56:53.838
FOR YOUR LAST THEATRICAL ENGAGEMENT.

56:54.039 --> 56:55.291
I'M NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS, DAVID,

56:55.498 --> 56:56.795
BUT THERE IS NO NEED TO BE RUDE TO ZOE.

56:56.958 --> 57:01.088
MY APOLOGIES. ZOE, 500.

57:01.296 --> 57:02.889
- AGREED.
- GENTLEMEN?

57:07.218 --> 57:08.720
AGREED.

57:08.929 --> 57:11.182
AS LONG AS THERE IS NO CHANCE
OF US BEING FOUND OUT.

57:11.389 --> 57:12.766
WE'LL HAVE TO FIND A NAME FOR HER.

57:12.974 --> 57:15.853
WHY? ZOE IS A YOUNG
ACTRESS, WHO HAPPENS TO BE

57:16.061 --> 57:19.110
MY SISTER-IN-LAW AND ASKED
ME TO NEGOTIATE FOR HER.

57:19.314 --> 57:22.693
IT'S EASY. WE JUST COLLECT THE MONEY.

57:22.901 --> 57:25.324
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID AT LEHMAN BROTHERS.

57:27.906 --> 57:29.374
READY?

57:29.574 --> 57:32.748
CHRIS HAS ASKED ME TO GO
FOR A DRINK WITH HIM.

57:32.953 --> 57:34.500
I'LL SEE YOU BACK AT THE HOUSE.

57:34.704 --> 57:36.581
YES, OF COURSE.

AND TALKING OF NAUGHTY, I
LOVED YOUR BOOK SO MUCH.

01:00:28.294 --> 01:00:30.592
THAT SCENE IN THE KITCHEN
WITH THE FOOD BLENDER.

01:00:30.797 --> 01:00:33.801
I'D ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT
THE POST FUNCTION WAS FOR.

01:00:34.008 --> 01:00:36.227
YES, THANK YOU, MATILDA, THAT WILL BE ALL.

01:00:36.427 --> 01:00:39.021
BYE.

01:00:39.222 --> 01:00:40.815
I MUST SAY, MISS FIELDER,

01:00:41.015 --> 01:00:45.145
I HAD NO IDEA ABOUT MOST
OF WHAT YOU PORTRAY.

01:00:45.353 --> 01:00:48.732
THE FOOD BLENDER,

01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:51.568
IS IT...

01:00:51.776 --> 01:00:54.370
ALL FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE?

01:00:54.571 --> 01:00:56.949
OH, I DON'T THINK THAT'S PERTINENT.

01:00:57.157 --> 01:00:59.410
MISS FIELDER, I HAVE TO WARN YOU,

01:00:59.617 --> 01:01:03.713
THAT PUBLICIZING THIS OUTRE
LITTLE TALE OF YOURS

01:01:03.913 --> 01:01:08.419
MAY INVOLVE SIMILARLY
IMPERTINENT QUESTIONS.

01:01:08.626 --> 01:01:11.755
ARE YOU SURE THAT YOU'RE READY FOR THIS?

01:01:11.963 --> 01:01:14.591
- DO I HAVE AN OPTION?
- NOT REALLY.

01:01:14.799 --> 01:01:18.770
FOR EXAMPLE, PUTTING ASIDE
THE INEVITABLE FASCINATION

01:01:18.970 --> 01:01:23.066
WITH THE "TOOLS OF YOUR TRADE,"

01:01:23.266 --> 01:01:26.691
WE'VE NOTICED STYLISTIC INCONSISTENCIES.

01:01:26.895 --> 01:01:29.739
YES, YES, IT'S AS THOUGH SEVERAL WRITERS

01:01:29.939 --> 01:01:31.361
WERE INVOLVED IN THE NARRATIVE.

01:01:31.566 --> 01:01:36.447
AND EACH WITH THEIR OWN IDENTIFIABLE STYLE.

01:01:36.654 --> 01:01:40.625
WELL, THAT'S VERY EASY TO EXPLAIN.

01:01:40.825 --> 01:01:43.248
BECAUSE THIS TYPE OF NOVEL
IS TRADITIONALLY WRITTEN

01:01:43.453 --> 01:01:46.673
IN THE FIRST PERSON, I
WANTED TO SEE IF I COULD

01:01:46.873 --> 01:01:48.671
ILLUSTRATE TH E VARIOUS CONTRASTING

01:01:48.875 --> 01:01:50.843
AND YET COMPLIMENTARY TRAITS THAT MAKE UP

01:01:51.044 --> 01:01:54.514
THE RICH COMPLEXITY OF ANY HUMAN CHARACTER.

01:01:54.714 --> 01:01:56.682
AND IT SEEMS I'VE SUCCEEDED.

01:01:57.884 --> 01:01:59.886
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

01:02:01.721 --> 01:02:03.974
INDEED.

01:02:04.182 --> 01:02:07.231
LET'S DO THE PAPERWORK AND
GET THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD.

01:03:18.589 --> 01:03:21.809
MISS FIELDER, I'M NOT
CONVINCED THAT VARYING

01:03:22.010 --> 01:03:24.638
THE NARRATIVE STYLE, WHICH
YOU HAVE DONE IN THIS BOOK,

01:03:24.846 --> 01:03:27.770
ALTOGETHER WORKS, BUT IT'S CERTAINLY

01:03:27.974 --> 01:03:31.899
A MOVE AWAY FROM THE NORM FOR THIS GENRE.

01:03:32.103 --> 01:03:34.231
WAS THIS A CONSCIOUS DECISION?

01:03:36.858 --> 01:03:41.284
FOUR AUTHORS WROTE THIS BOOK.

01:03:41.487 --> 01:03:46.493
OR, RATHER I HAD FOUR VOICES IN MY HEAD.

01:03:46.701 --> 01:03:48.829
FOUR DIFFERENT MANIFESTATIONS

01:03:49.037 --> 01:03:50.789
OF THE SAME WOMAN, IF YOU LIKE.

01:03:50.997 --> 01:03:53.796
SO YOU WEREN'T TRYING TO REDEFINE THE FORM?

01:03:53.958 --> 01:03:57.428
I WAS TRYING TO REDEFINE MY OVERDRAFT.

01:03:57.628 --> 01:03:59.722
ALL RIGHT, THAT WRAPS THINGS UP.

01:03:59.922 --> 01:04:01.390
THANK YOU VERY MUCH, INDEED,
FOR COMING THIS EVENING

01:04:01.591 --> 01:04:03.264
AND ASKING SO MANY INTERESTING QUESTIONS.

01:04:03.468 --> 01:04:05.562
DO STAY, HAVE A GLASS OF WINE, BUY A BOOK,

01:04:05.762 --> 01:04:09.062
AND ZOE WILL BE VERY HAPPY
TO SIGN YOUR COPY FOR YOU.

01:04:09.265 --> 01:04:10.983
THANK YOU SO MUCH TO ZOE FOR
COMING ALONG THIS EVENING.

01:04:19.817 --> 01:04:21.069
WELL, CLOSE SHAVE.

01:04:21.277 --> 01:04:23.029
- IS SHE PISSED?
- PISSED OFF, I THINK.

01:04:23.237 --> 01:04:25.160
IT'S A BIT OF A STRAIN DOING THESE EVENTS.

01:04:25.365 --> 01:04:26.912
LOOK, YOU'VE ALL SEEMED
TO HAVE GOT VERY CHUMMY.

01:04:27.116 --> 01:04:28.709
CHRIS, GO AND HAVE A WORD WITH HER.

01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:30.912
BUT SURELY YOU HAVE TO KNOW
THAT WOULD BE THE WORST THING.

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.872
- HE'S RIGHT.
- PUBLICITY TOUR FINISHES NEXT WEEK.

01:04:33.081 --> 01:04:35.209
SHE'S GIVEN US OUR SHARE OF THE MONEY.
WHY DON'T WE GIVE HER

01:04:35.416 --> 01:04:36.759
ANOTHER COUPLE OF MONTHS'
WORTH TO KEEP HER SWEET?

01:04:36.959 --> 01:04:38.882
- MONEY WELL SPENT, I'D SAY.
- AGREED.

01:04:39.087 --> 01:04:42.591
OKAY, WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH,
INDEED, FOR COMING, LADIES.

01:04:42.799 --> 01:04:44.301
I HOPE YOU ENJOYED IT.

01:04:44.509 --> 01:04:46.056
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE IN A FORTNIGHT'S TIME.

01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:48.012
CLIVE ANDERSON'S WRITTEN A
BOOK ABOUT A TALKING BADGER.

01:04:48.221 --> 01:04:50.064
WE'LL SEE YOU.

01:04:53.684 --> 01:04:55.982
I KNOW, I KNOW, I NEARLY BLEW II,

01:04:56.187 --> 01:04:59.066
BUT, I TELL YOU, IT'S GETTING
BLOODY DIFFICULT TO KEEP THIS UP.

01:04:59.273 --> 01:05:01.116
I'M SURE, AND I THINK
YOU'RE DOING AMAZINGLY.

01:05:01.317 --> 01:05:04.116
JUST HANG IN THERE.

01:05:05.738 --> 01:05:07.536
PEOPLE LEAVE GLASSES ANYWHERE.

01:05:09.450 --> 01:05:12.454
YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S WEIRDING ME OUT

01:05:12.662 --> 01:05:14.164
THAT THE WOMEN THAT COME TO THESE EVENTS...

01:05:14.372 --> 01:05:17.421
AND I MEAN IT, IT'S VIRTUALLY ALL WOMEN...

01:05:17.625 --> 01:05:20.253
AND THEY SEE ME AS SOME SORT OF
VOICE FOR THEIR OWN FANTASIES.

01:05:20.461 --> 01:05:22.463
BUT ISN'T THAT WHY THESE
BOOKS ARE SO POPULAR?

01:05:22.672 --> 01:05:23.924
WELL, OF COURSE, BUT...

01:05:24.132 --> 01:05:25.975
I MEAN, THE READERS

01:05:26.175 --> 01:05:28.473
ARE KIND OF BONDING WITH THE AUTHOR,

01:05:28.678 --> 01:05:31.227
ANOTHER WOMAN. I JUST FEEL BAD

01:05:31.431 --> 01:05:34.605
THAT THEY'RE BEING EXPLOITED
BY FOUR DIRTY OLD MEN.

01:05:34.809 --> 01:05:36.482
THANKS.

01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:41.403
SORRY.

01:05:41.607 --> 01:05:44.326
THREE MEN IN MACS AND AN APPRENTICE.

01:05:44.527 --> 01:05:46.495
I'M SORRY YOU FEEL LIKE THAT.

01:05:46.696 --> 01:05:49.449
IN FACT, I'M SORRY WE
STARTED THE WHOLE THING.

01:05:53.286 --> 01:05:55.880
- LITTLE GIFT FOR YOU, ANNIE.
- THANK YOU.

01:06:04.338 --> 01:06:06.215
I WAS IN THE AREA, SO I THOUGHT I'D SEE

01:06:06.424 --> 01:06:07.971
IF YOU WERE SLAVING OVER YOUR COPY.

01:06:08.176 --> 01:06:10.895
I'VE BEEN SNOOPING AT THE
CRAB AND LOBSTER FESTIVAL.

01:06:11.095 --> 01:06:14.269
- FASCINATING. EMELLY, BUT FASCINATING.
- THAT'S NICE.

01:06:14.474 --> 01:06:18.069
NOW THIS ZOE FIELDER GIRL,
YOUR SISTER-IN-LAW, I BELIEVE.

01:06:18.269 --> 01:06:20.067
- SHE IS.
- GOOD.

01:06:20.271 --> 01:06:21.818
SO YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY
TROUBLE GETTING HER TO DO

01:06:22.023 --> 01:06:23.445
AN INTERVIEW TOMORROW.

01:06:23.649 --> 01:06:26.528
OH, I DON'T THINK OUR LITTLE ONLINE EFFORT

01:06:26.736 --> 01:06:29.330
- WILL BE SUITABLE FOR HER.
- IT WON'T BE ONLINE.

01:06:29.530 --> 01:06:32.500
WE'RE BRINGING FORWARD THE
LAUNCH OF THE BROADCAST CHANNEL.

01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:35.328
A LOCAL CELEBRITY INTERVIEW
SHOULD KICK THINGS OFF PERFECTLY.

01:06:35.536 --> 01:06:38.164
SHE'S NOT REALLY LOCAL.
THERE'S NO CONNECTION.

01:06:38.372 --> 01:06:40.591
- WHERE IS SHE LIVING?
- WITH US.

01:06:40.791 --> 01:06:43.044
SHE'S LOCAL, WE NEED A CELEB.

01:06:43.252 --> 01:06:45.550
NELSA'S DEAD AND DELIA'S UNAVAILABLE.

01:06:45.755 --> 01:06:47.052
GET TO IT.

01:06:50.718 --> 01:06:53.141
THERE'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT, DAVID,

01:06:53.346 --> 01:06:54.689
THAT IS AS LONG AS YOUR QUESTIONS

01:06:54.889 --> 01:06:56.983
- ARE PROPERLY ORGANIZED.
- I THINK THEY ARE, YES.

01:06:57.183 --> 01:07:00.813
IT'S NO DIFFERENT TO WHAT YOU'VE
BEEN DOING FOR THE WEB, REALLY.

01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:03.364
WELL, ACTUALLY, IT IS.

01:07:03.564 --> 01:07:05.566
YOU WERE USING A POXY LITTLE DSLR

01:07:05.775 --> 01:07:09.029
AND WE'VE GOT THREE HIGH-DEFINITION
BROADCAST CAMERAS,

01:07:09.237 --> 01:07:11.786
WHICH WILL REVEAL YOUR EVERY BLEMISH.

01:07:11.989 --> 01:07:14.162
96 CHANNELS OF SOUND.

01:07:14.367 --> 01:07:18.793
DON'T LET YOUR EARPIECE
FALL OUT, WHATEVER YOU DO.

01:07:18.996 --> 01:07:22.546
AND A MILLION QUID'S WORTH
OF LIGHTS, AND OF COURSE,

01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:26.971
IT'S GOING OUT LIVE,
BUT, OTHER THAN THAT...

01:07:27.171 --> 01:07:30.015
OKAY, WE'RE SECONDS AWAY.

01:07:30.216 --> 01:07:33.641
RELAX. ENJOY YOURSELVES.

01:07:33.844 --> 01:07:38.975
GOING TO CAMERA
ONE IN FIVE, FOUR, THREE.

01:07:45.690 --> 01:07:49.991
WELCOME TO THIS VERY
FIRST EDITION OF ARTS...

01:07:50.194 --> 01:07:52.447
- CHAT.
- ...CHAT.

01:07:52.655 --> 01:07:56.535
I'M THRILLED TO BE TALKING
TO THE NEWEST VOICE

01:07:56.742 --> 01:07:59.871
IN ROMANTIC LITERATURE, ZOE FIELDER.

01:08:00.079 --> 01:08:02.047
THANKS FOR COMING ON THE SHOW, ZOE.

01:08:02.248 --> 01:08:03.625
IT'S MY PLEASURE.

01:08:03.833 --> 01:08:07.383
SO WHAT MADE YOU WRITE "LOVE LET HER,"

01:08:07.587 --> 01:08:11.057
WHICH CRITICS SAY REDEFINES THE GENRE,

01:08:11.257 --> 01:08:14.261
BUT IS CURRENTLY BANNED BY AT LEAST SIX

01:08:14.468 --> 01:08:16.687
OF EAST ANGLIA'S MOBILE LIBRARIES?

01:08:16.886 --> 01:08:20.140
YOU MEAN, "WHAT ON EARTH
MADE YOU WRITE IT?"

01:08:20.349 --> 01:08:23.523
NO, NO, I'M SURE YOU HAD YOUR REASONS,

01:08:23.728 --> 01:08:27.323
BUT IT IS VERY STEAMY STUFF.

01:08:27.523 --> 01:08:32.745
WELL, I WROTE IT BECAUSE I. HAVE A
RAVENOUS APPETITE FOR "STEAMY STUFF"

01:08:32.944 --> 01:08:35.493
THAT JUST WASN'T BEING
SATISFIED BY THE CURRENT CROP

01:08:35.698 --> 01:08:37.826
OF CLOYING CRAP ON THE SHELVES.

01:08:38.033 --> 01:08:41.504
MY ONE DESIRE IN LIFE IS DESIRE.

01:08:41.703 --> 01:08:45.459
I MEAN, RIGHT NOW IT'S ALL I CAN DO

01:08:45.666 --> 01:08:49.045
TO KEEP MY FEEBLE WOMANLY
MIND FROM IMAGINING

01:08:49.252 --> 01:08:50.970
GREASING A PAIR OF ANTIQUE BELLOWS.

01:08:51.171 --> 01:08:52.924
- SHUT HER UP!
- SHUT UP.

01:08:53.131 --> 01:08:56.477
- OH, I'M SORRY.
- OKAY.

01:08:56.676 --> 01:09:00.307
OKAY, LET'S GET THESE
OUT OF THE WAY QUICKLY,

01:09:00.514 --> 01:09:01.606
SHALL WE?

01:09:03.768 --> 01:09:07.238
"BASED ON EXPERIENCE"? WELL,
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO KNOW?

01:09:07.438 --> 01:09:10.191
"LITERARY MERIT"? NONE, PROBABLY.

01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:15.154
"IS IT IMPORTANT"? WELL,
THE TRICK QUESTION.

01:09:15.363 --> 01:09:18.207
"FEMINISM ." WELL, DO I
BELIEVE IN WOMEN'S EQUALITY?

01:09:18.407 --> 01:09:19.908
OF COURSE, I BLOODY DO.

01:09:20.117 --> 01:09:22.870
"DO TRUE FEMINISTS LIKE SEX"?
SOME DO, SOME DON'T.

01:09:23.078 --> 01:09:25.127
AS LONG AS THOSE THAT DON'T
DON'T SLAG OFF THOSE THAT DO,

01:09:25.331 --> 01:09:27.299
IT'S NOT AN ISSUE.

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:30.127
AND "WILL I BE WRITING A SEQUEL"?

01:09:30.336 --> 01:09:34.761
WELL, I'M NOT SURE. WHAT DO YOU THINK?

01:09:34.965 --> 01:09:39.640
WELL, I SUPPOSE IT'S DOWN TO
WHETHER WE DISLIKE THIS BOOK.

01:09:39.845 --> 01:09:41.221
EXACTLY.

01:09:41.430 --> 01:09:44.104
BUT IF THEY DO, I HAVE PLANS TO WRITE

01:09:44.308 --> 01:09:47.278
MANY, MANY MORE BOOKS.

01:09:47.478 --> 01:09:49.901
WATCH THIS SPACE.

01:09:50.106 --> 01:09:51.698
AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR A BREAK.

01:09:51.899 --> 01:09:54.118
THANK YOU, ZOE FIELDER, FOR
YOUR VERY FRANK ANSWERS

01:09:54.318 --> 01:09:57.071
AND GOOD LUCK WITH THE BOOK.

01:09:57.279 --> 01:09:58.997
AFTER THE BREAK...

01:09:59.198 --> 01:10:02.122
ONE MAN'S VIEW OF ARTISTIC BEAUTY.

01:10:02.326 --> 01:10:03.293
OFF AIR.

01:10:03.494 --> 01:10:04.916
NOT MUCH I CAN DO ABOUT THAT.

01:10:05.121 --> 01:10:06.998
JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU WHAT
HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE

01:10:07.206 --> 01:10:08.423
AN INEXPERIENCED PRESENTER.

01:10:08.624 --> 01:10:09.876
IT WAS FINE.

01:10:10.084 --> 01:10:13.554
JUST THE SORT OF THING
TO GET PEOPLE TALKING.

01:10:13.754 --> 01:10:16.758
AND HERE WE ARE. THEY'RE TWEETING ALREADY.

01:10:16.966 --> 01:10:20.015
"GO, ZOE, TELL THE GUY."

01:10:20.219 --> 01:10:24.019
"YAY! GIRL WITH ATTITUDE. GOOD FOR YOU."

01:10:24.223 --> 01:10:25.816
"YOU'RE A DISGRACE TO THE SISTERHOOD."

01:10:26.016 --> 01:10:28.269
WELL, CAN'T WIN 'EM ALL.

01:10:28.477 --> 01:10:31.947
I'M SORRY, DAVID. I DON'T
KNOW WHAT CAME OVER ME.

01:10:32.148 --> 01:10:35.243
BULLSHIT. YOU WERE JUST
FLEXING YOUR MUSCLES.

01:10:35.443 --> 01:10:38.947
MAYBE. OR MAYBE I WAS BEING THE
TYPE OF FEISTY YOUNG WOMAN

01:10:39.155 --> 01:10:41.123
THAT TV AUDIENCES LIKE.

01:10:41.323 --> 01:10:43.542
YOU WANT THEM TO BELIEVE I WROTE
THE DAMNED BOOK, DON'T YOU?

01:10:43.743 --> 01:10:46.041
OF COURSE, BUT I DON'T WANT THEM TO BELIEVE

01:10:46.245 --> 01:10:47.997
THERE'S A SODDING GREAT
LIBRARY IN THE OFFERING.

01:10:48.205 --> 01:10:51.755
COME ON, DAVID. IT'S TIME FOR
YOUR NEXT INSIGHTFUL ENCOUNTER.

01:10:51.959 --> 01:10:53.336
OH, BLOODY HELL.

01:10:53.544 --> 01:10:56.548
- THIS IS LILLY.
- COME ON, LILLY.

01:10:59.592 --> 01:11:01.811
PERSONALLY, I LIKED YOUR PERFORMANCE.

01:11:02.011 --> 01:11:04.560
WHICH, I SUSPECT IS WHAT IT WAS.

01:11:04.764 --> 01:11:07.608
I WAS JUST TRYING TO BE HONEST.

01:11:07.808 --> 01:11:09.810
NOT ALWAYS THE BEST POLICY.

01:11:10.019 --> 01:11:11.441
YOU NEED PEOPLE ON THE SIDE,

01:11:11.645 --> 01:11:15.821
THAT'S WHAT THESE JUNKETS ARE ALL ABOUT.

01:11:16.025 --> 01:11:19.074
NEVER BURN BRIDGES BEFORE THEY'RE BUILT.

01:11:19.278 --> 01:11:21.701
30 SECONDS AND
INTO THE NEXT INTERVIEW.

01:11:21.906 --> 01:11:25.376
STAND BY IN THE STUDIO AND SOMEONE
PLEASE FIND A DUSTPAN AND BRUSH.

01:11:25.576 --> 01:11:29.297
OH, BLOODY HELL.
PHIL, TRY TO CLEAN THIS UP.

01:11:34.710 --> 01:11:36.758
DO YOU REALLY HAVE TO GO?

01:11:36.962 --> 01:11:38.555
I HAVE TWO MORE INTERVIEWS TO DO IN LONDON.

01:11:38.756 --> 01:11:41.851
WHICH YOU MAY REMEMBER, IS WHERE I LIVE.

01:11:42.051 --> 01:11:43.724
THEN WHAT?

01:11:43.928 --> 01:11:46.681
AND THEN BACK TO THE REAL WORLD.

01:11:46.889 --> 01:11:49.688
IT'S FUNNY. I NEVER THOUGHT I'D
THINK OF ACTING AS THE REAL WORLD.

01:11:49.892 --> 01:11:52.611
- WILL YOU COME BACK?
- WILL YOU COME TO LONDON?

01:11:52.812 --> 01:11:54.234
I'VE GOT A PUB TO RUN.

01:11:54.438 --> 01:11:56.156
THANKS TO YOU.

01:11:56.357 --> 01:11:59.327
I COULD VISIT.

01:11:59.527 --> 01:12:01.245
THEN COME AND VISIT.

01:12:04.114 --> 01:12:05.741
LOOK, I NEVER ASKED, BUT I ASSUME

01:12:05.950 --> 01:12:07.952
YOUR CONTRIBUTION TO THE BOOK
WAS THE MOST HARDCORE STUFF.

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:11.004
NO, IT WAS THE LEAST HARDCORE STUFF.

01:12:11.205 --> 01:12:14.379
- THE POETIC BITS?
- YES, THANK GOD.

01:12:18.128 --> 01:12:20.130
YOU'RE REALLY QUITE PRUDISH, AREN'T YOU?

01:12:20.339 --> 01:12:22.762
I'M NOT PRUDISH.

01:12:22.967 --> 01:12:24.435
I...

01:12:29.014 --> 01:12:30.857
- YOU AGAIN? PISS OFF.
- OH, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:36.739
TO MY FRIEND OVER THERE,
YOU JUST RUINED THE MOST

01:12:36.939 --> 01:12:38.236
ROMANTIC MOMENT OF MY LIFE.

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:41.319
WELL, HERE'S TO OUR YOUNGEST, NAUGHTIEST

01:12:41.527 --> 01:12:43.575
AND MOST LUCRATIVE AUTHOR.

01:12:43.779 --> 01:12:46.623
- CHEERS.
- CHEERS.

01:12:49.493 --> 01:12:52.872
AND YOU'RE GOING TO BE AN
EVEN WEALTHIER YOUNG LADY.

01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:55.583
CONGRATULATIONS.

01:12:55.791 --> 01:12:57.168
WHAT'S HAPPENED?

01:12:57.376 --> 01:13:00.220
THE PUBLISHERS WANT YOU TO
SIGN FOR THREE MORE BOOKS.

01:13:00.421 --> 01:13:02.094
WE'RE STILL NEGOTIATING THE ADVANCE,

01:13:02.298 --> 01:13:04.801
BUT IT WILL BE WELL INTO SEVEN FIGURES.

01:13:05.009 --> 01:13:07.262
THE FILM RIGHTS HAVE BEEN SNAPPED UP.

01:13:07.469 --> 01:13:09.096
WE'RE GOING FOR A TINY ADVANCE

01:13:09.305 --> 01:13:12.400
BUT A SOCKING GREAT PERCENTAGE.

01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:14.819
AND THE SCREENPLAY IS ALREADY UNDERWAY.

01:13:15.019 --> 01:13:16.396
DIRECTOR'S BEEN BOOKED,

01:13:16.604 --> 01:13:20.325
AND THEY START CASTING NEXT WEEK.

01:13:20.524 --> 01:13:22.117
WHAT DO I DO?

01:13:22.318 --> 01:13:24.286
SIGN THE CONTRACT AND ENJOY YOURSELF.

01:13:27.072 --> 01:13:30.576
I NEED A LITTLE TIME.

01:13:30.784 --> 01:13:32.878
IT'S A BIG ASK.

01:13:33.078 --> 01:13:35.957
OH, IT'LL BE FINE.

01:13:36.165 --> 01:13:38.714
IF THEY RUSH RELEASE THE
FILM AND IT'S A SUCCESS,

01:13:38.918 --> 01:13:42.889
IT'LL PUT THE PRICE OF YOUR
PUBLISHING ADVANCE UP.

01:13:43.088 --> 01:13:45.967
LEAVE IT TO US. YOU'RE IN SAFE HANDS.

01:13:49.386 --> 01:13:53.061
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.
MORE ABOUT ZOE'S BOOK.

01:13:53.265 --> 01:13:57.987
"CASTING IS UNDERWAY FOR THE FILM OF
THE LATEST MUMMY PORN PHENOMENON,

01:13:58.187 --> 01:13:59.234
'LOVE LET HER.'

01:13:59.438 --> 01:14:01.156
FANS OF THE BOOK ARE ALREADY ARGUING

01:14:01.357 --> 01:14:03.280
OVER WHO SHOULD PLAY THE CRUCIAL ROLES

01:14:03.484 --> 01:14:06.704
OF THE ULTRA SMOOTH HEADMASTER AND
THE OBJECT OF HIS LURID FANTASIES."

01:14:06.904 --> 01:14:10.249
- I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
- MUM, WHAT'S A "LURID FANTASY"?

01:14:10.449 --> 01:14:11.871
YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND.

01:14:12.076 --> 01:14:13.794
AND SO ARE YOU, YOUNG LADY.

01:14:13.994 --> 01:14:16.088
I WANT TO READ AUNTIE ZOE'S BOOK.

01:14:16.288 --> 01:14:18.416
- WHERE HAVE YOU HIDDEN IT?
- WHERE YOU CAN'T FIND IT.

01:14:18.624 --> 01:14:20.547
YOU CAN READ IT WHEN YOU'RE
OLD ENOUGH TO APPRECIATE IT,

01:14:20.751 --> 01:14:22.719
BY WHICH TIME YOU'LL PROBABLY
WONDER WHAT ALL THE FUSS WAS ABOUT.

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:25.173
I CAN'T HELP WONDERING THAT ANYWAY.

01:14:25.381 --> 01:14:28.055
STILL, IT WON'T HURT ZOE'S BANK BALANCE.

01:14:28.258 --> 01:14:30.135
WILL YOU JUST GO! WE'RE LATE ALREADY.

01:14:30.344 --> 01:14:32.267
WHY DOES IT ALWAYS HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS?

01:14:32.471 --> 01:14:33.597
QUICK, QUICK, QUICK, QUICK, QUICK.

01:14:33.806 --> 01:14:34.932
BYE, LOVE. HAVE A GOOD DAY.

01:14:35.140 --> 01:14:36.517
- BYE-BYE, DARLING.
- BYE-BYE, DARLING.

01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:44.951
THE DAM THAT BLOCKS MY HEART
IS OVERFLOWING WITH EMOTION.

01:14:45.150 --> 01:14:46.993
AND MY HEART'S FULL TO BURSTING.

01:14:47.194 --> 01:14:49.492
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO... DO?

01:14:49.697 --> 01:14:51.574
YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME.

01:14:51.782 --> 01:14:54.126
WHATEVER I ASK YOU TO DO, IT'S FOR US.

01:14:54.326 --> 01:14:59.674
WHAT? ARE YOU GOING TO ASK ME TO DO?

01:14:59.873 --> 01:15:04.219
OH, SAUCE. WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO ASK ME TO DO?

01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:07.390
SNOW ME HOW MUCH YOU WANT ME.

01:15:07.589 --> 01:15:11.014
I'M A LITTLE SCARED.

01:15:11.218 --> 01:15:15.018
NOT HALF AS SCARED AS WE ARE.

01:15:15.222 --> 01:15:17.145
THANK YOU. THAT WAS REALLY GREAT.

01:15:17.349 --> 01:15:19.397
- BUT I READ IT WRONG.
- EASILY DONE.

01:15:19.601 --> 01:15:21.649
SHALL WE LOOK AT THE BREAKUP SCENE?

01:15:21.854 --> 01:15:23.026
PAGE 90.

01:15:26.775 --> 01:15:30.405
MY HEART IS NOT A BARGAINING
CHIP FOR YOUR CHEAP LIES.

01:15:30.612 --> 01:15:32.034
I CAN'T AFFORD...

01:15:32.239 --> 01:15:35.163
SORRY. THIS IS WHERE WE
NEED TO FEEL REAL EMPATHY

01:15:35.367 --> 01:15:38.587
WITH THE CHARACTER. YOU
KNOW, SEE SOME PASSION.

01:15:38.787 --> 01:15:40.209
IMAGINE YOU'RE ON THE CATWALK

01:15:40.414 --> 01:15:42.587
AND ALL THE BUYERS SUDDENLY
TURN THEIR BACKS ON YOU.

01:15:42.791 --> 01:15:46.466
OH, RIGHT, RIGHT. OKAY.

01:15:46.670 --> 01:15:50.641
MY HEART IS NOT A BARGAINING
CHIP FOR YOUR CHEAP LIES.

01:15:50.841 --> 01:15:53.845
I CAN'T... I CAN'T AFFORD TO
SELL MYSELF AT THE LOVE MARKET.

01:15:54.053 --> 01:15:55.521
THE PRICE IS ALREADY ROCK BOTTOM

01:15:55.721 --> 01:15:58.099
AND I WONT SLASH IT ANY FURTHER.

01:15:58.307 --> 01:16:00.560
IS THAT WHAT OUR PASSION IS WORTH?

01:16:00.768 --> 01:16:02.611
THAT'S JUST IT.

01:16:02.811 --> 01:16:04.438
IN MY MIND THE PRICE HAS SKYROCKETED

01:16:04.646 --> 01:16:06.489
AND THE REVENUE TRIPLED.
CAN'T YOU SEE THAT?

01:16:13.113 --> 01:16:15.207
LET'S TAKE A BREAK, SHALL WE?

01:16:15.407 --> 01:16:19.287
LOOK, I'M REALLY, REALLY SORRY,

01:16:19.536 --> 01:16:21.538
BUT I'M AN ACTRESS AND I
HAVE REALLY STRONG IDEAS

01:16:21.747 --> 01:16:25.001
ABOUT HOW THE WORDS SHOULD BE SPOKEN.

01:16:25.209 --> 01:16:27.382
MY WORDS.

01:16:27.586 --> 01:16:29.463
WELL, THAT'S FINE.

01:16:29.671 --> 01:16:32.015
GIVE US FIVE MINUTES?

01:16:32.216 --> 01:16:33.513
THANK YOU.

01:16:36.553 --> 01:16:39.102
SHE'S RAW AS HELL, BUT SHE
CAN CERTAINLY ACCESS IT.

01:16:39.306 --> 01:16:42.230
SHE MAY BE AN ACTRESS, BUT I'M
AFRAID SHE'S NOT ON MY RADAR.

01:16:42.434 --> 01:16:44.436
SHE'S NOT A FRIGGIN' MISSILE.

01:16:44.645 --> 01:16:47.990
- YOU DID ASK ME TO FIND BIG NAMES.
- I DID.

01:16:48.190 --> 01:16:49.533
AND YOU HAVE.

01:16:49.733 --> 01:16:52.532
THE POINT IS DO WE PAY A LOT OF MONEY

01:16:52.736 --> 01:16:55.910
FOR THE LATEST TRENDY ACTRESS
OR A LOT LESS FOR SOMEONE

01:16:56.115 --> 01:16:57.583
WHO'S IN THE UNIQUE POSITION

01:16:57.783 --> 01:16:59.785
OF ACTUALLY HAVING WRITTEN
THE ORIGINAL BOOK?

01:16:59.993 --> 01:17:02.291
I DON'T THINK THAT'S HAPPENED BEFORE.

01:17:02.496 --> 01:17:04.749
EMMA THOMPSON... "SENSE AND SENSIBILITY."

01:17:04.957 --> 01:17:08.006
I THINK YOU'LL FIND JANE
AUSTEN HAD HER HAND IN THAT.

01:17:08.210 --> 01:17:10.212
SO, DO WE HAVE A GO?

01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:14.300
WELL, THE MARKETING PEOPLE
WILL WET THEIR KNICKERS.

01:17:14.508 --> 01:17:16.351
GIVE ME A COUPLE OF DAYS WITH HER.

01:17:16.552 --> 01:17:20.147
SO, YOU SEE, IT WASN'T JUST
DAVID, IT WAS ALL FOUR OF THEM.

01:17:20.347 --> 01:17:22.315
I SEE. WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS?

01:17:22.516 --> 01:17:24.143
BECAUSE IT'S
ALL JUST GONE A BIT NUTS.

01:17:24.351 --> 01:17:28.151
I MEAN, NO ONE MEANT ANY HARM,
I GUESS WE DID SAVE THE PUB.

01:17:28.355 --> 01:17:30.608
OH, WELL, THAT'S IMPRESSIVE, THEN.

01:17:30.816 --> 01:17:33.365
PLEASE DON'T
BE ANGRY WITH DAVID...

01:17:33.569 --> 01:17:35.446
OR ME.

01:17:35.654 --> 01:17:37.406
I'M NOT VERY ANGRY.

01:17:37.614 --> 01:17:41.494
AND I GUESS DAVID, AT LEAST, GETS
TO WRITE HIS NOVEL, IN A WAY.

01:17:41.702 --> 01:17:44.376
I'M JUST OUT OF MY DEPTH.

01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:46.924
ME TOO, THAT'S WHY I HAD TO CALL.

01:17:47.124 --> 01:17:49.798
NO YOU WANT ALL THIS?

01:17:50.002 --> 01:17:52.596
YOU KNOW IT'S A FAUSTIAN PACT, DON'T YOU?

01:17:52.796 --> 01:17:56.300
YES, I DO.

01:17:56.508 --> 01:17:58.886
AND I THINK I CAN COPE.

01:18:01.847 --> 01:18:03.690
JEN, THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.

01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:09.063
ISN'T THAT YOUR SISTER-IN-LAW THERE, DAVID?

01:18:09.271 --> 01:18:11.649
LOOKS LIKE THERE'S NO STOPPING HER NOW.

01:18:11.857 --> 01:18:13.359
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. HOW COULD SHE?

01:18:13.567 --> 01:18:14.443
HOW COULD SHE WHAT?

01:18:14.651 --> 01:18:16.278
DEGRADE HERSELF LIKE THIS.

01:18:16.486 --> 01:18:18.159
WELL, PRESUMABLY SHE WANTS THE JOB.

01:18:18.363 --> 01:18:20.036
BUT SHE DOESN'T.

01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:21.412
I'M GOING TO LONDON.

01:18:21.617 --> 01:18:23.244
- WHY?
- I DON'T KNOW.

01:18:23.452 --> 01:18:24.954
WELL, <i>"COUP DE FOUDRE."</i>

01:18:25.162 --> 01:18:26.630
- YEAH, THANKS FOR THAT.
- WHAT JUSTIN MEANS BY THAT...

01:18:26.830 --> 01:18:29.424
YEAH, I KNOW WHAT HE MEANS, YOU SMUG GITS.

01:18:29.625 --> 01:18:32.003
IN FACT, I KNOW WHAT MOST OF YOUR
FANCY LITERARY ALLUSIONS MEAN.

01:18:32.211 --> 01:18:35.306
- I JUST LET YOU ENJOY PATRONIZING ME.
- CHRIS, WE NEVER...

01:18:35.505 --> 01:18:38.600
IT WAS A <i>"COUP DE FOUDRE"</i>
ALL THOSE MONTHS AGO.

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:40.598

01:20:12.185 --> 01:20:13.562
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

01:20:13.770 --> 01:20:15.613
TREVOR, CALL SECURITY, NOW!

01:20:15.814 --> 01:20:17.691
WAIT, WAIT, I'M SORRY,
I'M SORRY, I KNOW HIM.

01:20:17.899 --> 01:20:19.742
- JUST GIVE ME TWO MINUTES.
- YOU GOT TWO MINUTES

01:20:19.943 --> 01:20:22.446
- AND THEN YOU'RE OUT OF HERE.
- IT'S OKAY, EVERYONE.

01:20:22.654 --> 01:20:24.327
- SO?
- YOU SHOULDN'T BE DOING THIS.

01:20:24.531 --> 01:20:26.204
AND WHAT THE HELL GIVES YOU
THE RIGHT TO MAKE A JUDGMENT?

01:20:26.408 --> 01:20:31.039
NOTHING. EXCEPT WHAT I FEEL FOR YOU.

01:20:31.246 --> 01:20:34.295
AND WHAT DO YOU FEEL?

01:20:34.499 --> 01:20:36.467
DOESN'T MATTER NOW.

01:20:38.628 --> 01:20:44.510
LOOK, I LIKE YOU A LOT,

01:20:44.718 --> 01:20:47.016
BUT CHANCES TO STAR IN A FILM
DON'T COME ALONG EVERY DAY.

01:20:47.220 --> 01:20:48.972
IF YOU'RE TALENTED, THEY DO.

01:20:49.181 --> 01:20:51.684
YOU DON'T NEED TO... YOU
KNOW, TAKE YOUR KIT OFF,

01:20:51.892 --> 01:20:54.236
- SUBJECT YOURSELF...
- I'M NOT TAKING...

01:20:54.436 --> 01:20:56.188
GOD, YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING, DO YOU?

01:20:56.396 --> 01:20:58.114
I MEAN, YOU WROTE THE BLOODY BOOK,

01:20:58.315 --> 01:21:00.568
AND NOW YOU'RE COMING OVER
HERE ALL SANCTIMONIOUS.

01:21:00.776 --> 01:21:04.781
I KEPT MY END OF THE BARGAIN.
YOU KEEP YOURS.

01:21:04.988 --> 01:21:07.741
GO BACK TO YOUR PUB AND LET
ME MAKE SOMETHING OF MY LIFE.

01:21:07.949 --> 01:21:09.451
BUT THAT'S JUST IT.

01:21:09.659 --> 01:21:11.161
DO YOU REALLY WANT THIS KIND OF LIFE?

01:21:11.370 --> 01:21:14.249
YES. I DO.

01:21:14.456 --> 01:21:16.049
I'VE GOT THE TASTE FOR MONEY AND FAME

01:21:16.249 --> 01:21:18.422
AND I INTEND TO GET VERY USED TO IT.

01:21:22.047 --> 01:21:24.425
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING.
- GOOD.

01:21:24.633 --> 01:21:28.354
- DON'T TRY THIS AGAIN.
- I WON'T.

01:21:28.553 --> 01:21:33.104
LOOK SON, SHE'S ACTING. THAT'S ALL IT IS.

01:21:33.308 --> 01:21:34.150
NONE OF THIS IS REAL.

01:21:34.351 --> 01:21:36.228
NO.

01:21:36.436 --> 01:21:39.360
YOU'RE DEAD RIGHT, IT'S NOT.

01:21:39.564 --> 01:21:40.941
COME ON.

01:21:41.149 --> 01:21:43.072
QUIET, PLEASE. CHECK THE SHOOT.

01:21:43.276 --> 01:21:45.404
ANYONE WHO ISN'T REQUIRED,
LEAVE THE SET NOW.

01:21:45.612 --> 01:21:47.910
- WE DID.
- OKAY.

01:21:48.115 --> 01:21:50.117
- TAKE.
- MARK IT.

01:22:30.532 --> 01:22:33.877
GOD KNOWS WHAT YOUR SIR
GALAHAD ENCOUNTER STIRRED UP,

01:22:34.077 --> 01:22:37.456
BUT SHE'S NOW DECIDED TO SIGN
FOR ANOTHER THREE BOOKS,

01:22:37.664 --> 01:22:39.416
ON TERMS RATHER MORE FAVORABLE TO HER.

01:22:39.624 --> 01:22:41.001
WHAT'S OUR SHARE?

01:22:41.209 --> 01:22:42.506
FIVE GRAND A BOOK.

01:22:42.711 --> 01:22:44.213
- EACH?
- BETWEEN US.

01:22:44.421 --> 01:22:46.094
- GOOD GOD.
- SHIT.

01:22:46.298 --> 01:22:48.096
ANYWAY, I WOULDN'T WANT IT IF
IT WERE A HUNDRED TIMES THAT.

01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:49.973
WHAT WE DID WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE A BIT OF A LAUGH,

01:22:50.177 --> 01:22:51.554
BASICALLY, TO HELP CHRIS.

01:22:51.761 --> 01:22:53.638
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO HER.

01:22:53.847 --> 01:22:57.397
IT'S OBVIOUS. SHE LIKES THE HIGH LIFE.
AND WHY SHOULDN'T SHE?

01:22:57.601 --> 01:22:59.148
WE SET HER UP FOR IT.

01:22:59.352 --> 01:23:01.821
ACTUALLY, I SET HER UP.

01:23:02.022 --> 01:23:03.945
WE ARE SO TOTALLY BUGGERED.

01:23:04.149 --> 01:23:05.742
IF WE DON'T WRITE THE BLOODY THING

01:23:05.942 --> 01:23:07.159
SHE'LL BE OUTING US TO THE PRESS

01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:09.033
QUICKER THAN YOU CAN SAY "BDSM."

01:23:09.237 --> 01:23:10.659
I STILL DON'T SEE WHY WE CAN'T JUST OWN UP,

01:23:10.864 --> 01:23:12.207
GET OUT OF IT.

01:23:12.407 --> 01:23:14.956
BECAUSE I HAVE SPENT THE LAST YEAR

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:16.958
BERATING JEN ABOUT HER READING HABITS,

01:23:17.162 --> 01:23:19.790
NOT TO MENTION DENOUNCING
IN PRINT AND ON SCREEN

01:23:19.998 --> 01:23:21.124
ALL THINGS CHICK AND MUMMY.

01:23:21.333 --> 01:23:24.337
AND DESPITE 40 YEARS EXEMPLARY SERVICE,

01:23:24.544 --> 01:23:26.967
THE HEADMASTER WILL JUSTIFIABLY REMOVE

01:23:27.172 --> 01:23:30.051
MY REPUTATION, PENSION, AND TESTES.

01:23:30.258 --> 01:23:31.931
WELL, AT LEAST NOW THAT YOU'RE
RETIRED, YOU CAN LIE LOW.

01:23:32.135 --> 01:23:34.809
I HAD LADY FERMLEY-CADWALLER
ASKING ME FOR MY AUTOGRAPH TODAY

01:23:35.013 --> 01:23:36.811
ON THE BASIS THAT I VAGUELY KNOW ZOE.

01:23:37.015 --> 01:23:38.767
AUTOGRAPH...?

01:23:38.975 --> 01:23:40.818
AUTOGRAPH.

01:23:41.019 --> 01:23:45.445
GENTLEMEN, I MAY HAVE HAD A BRILLIANT IDEA.

01:23:45.649 --> 01:23:47.071
BASED ON YOUR PREVIOUS BRILLIANT IDEAS,

01:23:47.275 --> 01:23:48.777
I THINK THAT MIGHT LOOSELY
COUNT AS AN OXYMORON.

01:23:48.985 --> 01:23:50.453
OH, WELL, STRICTLY SPEAKING, OF COURSE,

01:23:50.654 --> 01:23:52.531
IT'S NOT ACTUALLY AN OXYMORON.

01:23:52.739 --> 01:23:56.710
- I SAID, LOOSELY.
- CEASE AND DESIST. HERE'S THE PLAN.

01:24:00.622 --> 01:24:02.875
- IT'S US.
- WE ONLY HAVE A MOMENT.

01:24:03.083 --> 01:24:06.383
I LEFT JEN IN THE BOO... IN THE
BOOZER AND SHE'S FRETTING.

01:24:06.586 --> 01:24:09.009
ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS SHOVE
ONE OF THESE UNDER ZOE'S NOSE

01:24:09.214 --> 01:24:11.558
AS SHE SWANS DOWN THE RED CARPET.

01:24:11.758 --> 01:24:13.601
WE JUST NEED ONE LEGIBLE SIGNATURE FROM HER

01:24:13.802 --> 01:24:15.270
TO ATTACH TO HER RESCINDED CONTRACT

01:24:15.470 --> 01:24:18.064
- AND OUR TROUBLES ARE OVER.
- OR JUST BEGINNING.

01:24:18.265 --> 01:24:19.733
I'M SURE IT MUST BE ILLEGAL.

01:24:19.975 --> 01:24:22.854
SHE WON'T HAVE THE GUTS TO
OWN UP TO BEING SO DIM.

01:24:23.061 --> 01:24:26.235
WHAT IF SHE RECOGNIZES ME?

01:24:26.439 --> 01:24:28.066
THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THREE TRIES.

01:24:28.275 --> 01:24:30.653
- AND IF SHE WON'T SIGN IT?
- SHE WILL.

01:24:30.860 --> 01:24:32.237
THEY ALWAYS DO.

01:24:37.826 --> 01:24:40.500
ZOE! ZOE!

01:24:45.333 --> 01:24:46.755
MISS ZOE.

01:25:14.988 --> 01:25:16.831
BY THE WAY, CHRIS, I'VE
BEEN MEANING TO ASK YOU,

01:25:17.032 --> 01:25:19.706
WHAT DID ZOE WRITE IN YOUR AUTOGRAPH BOOK?

01:25:19.909 --> 01:25:22.458
"MEN ARE STUPENDOUSLY DIM."

01:25:22.662 --> 01:25:24.164
NEVER A TRUER WORD.

01:25:24.372 --> 01:25:26.716
JEN, WHAT THE... WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

01:25:26.916 --> 01:25:28.589
WE'VE COME TO SIGN UP
FOR THE WRITERS' GROUP.

01:25:28.793 --> 01:25:30.295
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE DOING

01:25:30.503 --> 01:25:33.598
SOME JOLLY INTERESTING AND
THOUGHT-PROVOKING STUFF.

01:25:33.798 --> 01:25:35.141
I WISH YOU COULD SEE YOURSELVES.

01:25:35.342 --> 01:25:36.764
LIKE A BUNCH OF NAUGHTY SCHOOLBOYS.

01:25:36.968 --> 01:25:38.970
I'M NOT SURE IF I FIND
MOST INSULTING THE FACT

01:25:39.179 --> 01:25:40.977
THAT YOU'VE BEEN LYING TO ME ALL THIS TIME,

01:25:41.181 --> 01:25:43.434
OR THAT YOU THINK THAT
GEOFFREY AND I ARE SO PATHETIC

01:25:43.642 --> 01:25:46.020
WE HAD TO BE EXCLUDED FROM YOUR SILLY GAME.

01:25:46.227 --> 01:25:48.446
WELL, WE JUST DIDN'T WANT TO UPSET YOU.

01:25:48.647 --> 01:25:50.866
OH, PLEASE.

01:25:51.066 --> 01:25:53.569
- HOW DID YOU FIND OUT?
- I'VE KNOWN FOR A WHILE.

01:25:53.777 --> 01:25:55.950
ZOE CALLED ME AND SHE WAS QUITE CONCERNED.

01:25:56.154 --> 01:25:58.156
SO SHE BLOODY WELL SHOULD BE.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT...

01:25:58.365 --> 01:26:00.208
WHAT THE NEW DEAL WAS? YES, OF COURSE.

01:26:00.408 --> 01:26:03.878
WHAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW IS
THAT SHE NEVER SIGNED IT.

01:26:04.079 --> 01:26:06.923
WHY?

01:26:07.123 --> 01:26:09.251
MAYBE IT WAS SOMETHING YOU SAID.

01:26:09.459 --> 01:26:11.052
ANYWAY, IT'S ALL ACADEMIC NOW,

01:26:11.252 --> 01:26:13.880
IF ONE DARE USE THAT WORD IN THIS CONTEXT.

01:26:14.089 --> 01:26:15.966
WELL, YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
ALL SO KEEN TO INDULGE

01:26:16.174 --> 01:26:17.892
YOUR SILLY GUILT YOU DON'T
KNOW ABOUT THE FILM.

01:26:18.093 --> 01:26:19.345
WHAT ABOUT IT?

01:26:19.552 --> 01:26:22.522
WELL, APPARENTLY, IT HAD
A GREAT FIRST WEEKEND,

01:26:22.722 --> 01:26:25.441
WHATEVER THAT MEANS, AND THEN THE
PUBLIC DECIDED IT WAS DRIVEL.

01:26:25.642 --> 01:26:29.738
SO, NO MONEY, AND NO FOLLOW-UP BOOK DEAL.

01:26:29.938 --> 01:26:32.407
BUT GET THIS INTO YOUR THICK HEADS.

01:26:32.607 --> 01:26:35.486
ZOE DECIDED IT WAS ALL WRONG
BEFORE THE FILM TANKED.

01:26:35.694 --> 01:26:37.788
THERE WAS NEVER GONNA BE ANY MORE MONEY.

01:26:37.987 --> 01:26:41.537
WE REALLY DIDN'T WANT THE MONEY.
HONESTLY, JEN.

01:26:41.741 --> 01:26:43.664
I ACTUALLY ACCEPT THAT.

01:26:43.868 --> 01:26:46.166
BUT YOU'D BETTER ACCEPT
THAT MY LOVELY SISTER

01:26:46.371 --> 01:26:50.501
IS THE ONLY ONE OF YOU WHO COMES
OUT OF THIS WITH ANY DIGNITY.

01:26:50.709 --> 01:26:53.883
NOW HOW MUCH MONEY DO YOU HAVE LEFT?

01:26:54.087 --> 01:26:55.339
ABOUT 900 QUID.

01:26:55.547 --> 01:26:58.471
GEOFFREY, 900 QUID.

01:26:58.675 --> 01:27:00.097
