WEBVTT

00:07.091 --> 00:10.800
Seven years had passed since
peace returned to the Earth,

00:11.011 --> 00:15.880
and Gohan, who had traveled to
Satan City to attend high school,

00:16.100 --> 00:18.216
was trying to live a normal high school life

00:18.435 --> 00:22.348
without drawing any
attention to himself. However...

00:23.357 --> 00:25.063
Come get some!

00:27.069 --> 00:29.435
Who do you think you are?!

00:46.880 --> 00:48.336
Say...

00:48.549 --> 00:50.585
And I flew all the way here, too.

00:50.801 --> 00:54.885
Ah, Videl-sama, it was that Golden Warrior.

00:55.097 --> 00:56.212
The Golden Warrior?

00:56.432 --> 00:58.172
Oh, yeah, and he was probably a student

00:58.392 --> 01:00.849
at Orange Star High School, like you.

01:01.061 --> 01:04.804
--Huh?
--He was wearing the same school badge.

01:06.024 --> 01:09.482
On his first day of school,
rumors of a "Golden Warrior"

01:09.695 --> 01:12.732
were quickly spreading throughout the city.

01:12.948 --> 01:13.778
Listen...

01:13.991 --> 01:17.074
The Golden Warrior was supposedly
wearing a badge from this school,

01:17.286 --> 01:22.076
a whitish shirt with a black vest,
and brown slacks.

01:22.291 --> 01:23.872
It may be a coincidence,
but you're a dead ringer, huh?

01:24.084 --> 01:26.291
N-No, l was just...

01:28.255 --> 01:30.291
Something's fishy, all right.

01:40.893 --> 01:42.383
Huh?

01:50.152 --> 01:52.268
The city sure is exhausting.

01:52.488 --> 01:55.321
And l have to say, as for the "Golden Warrior,"

01:55.532 --> 01:58.490
I'm going to need a better set-up,
so people don't know it's me.

01:58.702 --> 02:00.533
I think I'll talk to Bulma-san about that.

02:00.746 --> 02:05.866
And so, Gohan headed off
to consult with Bulma.

03:33.255 --> 03:37.965
"A New Hero, the Great Saiyaman, is Born!"

03:51.398 --> 03:55.107
A complete transformation,
so people don't know who you are?

03:55.319 --> 03:59.312
Yes. I thought you were sure to have
some good ideas, Bulma-san,

03:59.531 --> 04:01.988
so I stopped by on my way home from school.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.815
Is there any good way to do it?

04:04.036 --> 04:06.573
Yes, there is. I'm a genius, after all.

04:06.788 --> 04:09.916
In short, I can take a suit
that you'll transform into

04:10.125 --> 04:11.490
and convert it into particles,

04:11.710 --> 04:13.792
like with a Capsule,
which will allow you to equip it.

04:14.004 --> 04:18.122
You mean it? By all means,
I'd like to ask for that.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.503
Not standing by and letting criminals get away

04:20.719 --> 04:23.210
is so like you, Gohan-kun.

04:23.430 --> 04:26.843
Sure thing. I'll make it for you.
Just give me a couple of hours.

04:27.059 --> 04:32.349
You can do it in two hours?
I owe you one! Thank you very much!

04:32.564 --> 04:34.225
All right, just sit tight, okay?

04:34.441 --> 04:37.774
Um... Where is Trunks-kun?

04:37.986 --> 04:40.022
Just sitting around waiting is so boring.

04:40.238 --> 04:44.777
Oh, my guess is that Trunks is getting a
workout from Vegeta in the Gravity Room.

04:44.993 --> 04:47.075
Huh? From Vegeta-san?

04:47.287 --> 04:50.905
He said it was about time for him
to start full-fledged training,

04:51.124 --> 04:53.331
so he's teaching him some fighting skills.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.204
It sounds like he wants to make Trunks

04:55.420 --> 04:56.671
even stronger than you, Gohan-kun.

04:56.880 --> 04:59.838
Wow, that's a scary thought.

05:00.050 --> 05:03.793
Let's see, the Gravity Room...
Where is that again?

05:05.597 --> 05:07.212
Yo, Trunks!

05:07.432 --> 05:10.640
Oh, Gohan-san! When did you get here?

05:10.852 --> 05:12.843
| just barely arrived.

05:13.063 --> 05:16.305
Hey, I hear you're getting
trained by your father.

05:16.525 --> 05:18.015
Mm-hmm.

05:24.241 --> 05:26.823
Hello there, Vegeta-san. Pardon the intrusion.

05:27.035 --> 05:28.536
Yeah.

05:30.288 --> 05:33.701
Gohan, you're out of shape.

05:33.917 --> 05:37.501
No matter how peaceful things are, you train.

05:37.713 --> 05:39.203
Right...

05:40.924 --> 05:43.165
Hey, what do you want to play?

05:43.385 --> 05:45.341
Huh? Oh...

05:45.554 --> 05:48.216
Gohan-kun, it's ready.

05:53.353 --> 05:56.766
All l have to do is push the red button, then?

05:56.982 --> 05:57.732
That's right.

05:57.941 --> 06:01.604
How nice! Mom, make one for me, too!

06:06.283 --> 06:09.275
Ah! It looks cool, doesn't it?

06:09.494 --> 06:10.529
Doesn't it?

06:10.746 --> 06:15.035
Yeah! Good! This is terribly good!

06:15.250 --> 06:17.992
I don't want one after all.

06:19.838 --> 06:22.045
All right, thank you very much!

06:22.257 --> 06:24.794
Come on over again! Bye-bye!

06:25.010 --> 06:27.217
Bye-bye!

06:29.264 --> 06:34.133
Take me home, Kinto Un!
It's getting late, so go full speed.

06:38.482 --> 06:41.724
Now I can get by without
anyone suspecting it's me.

06:46.406 --> 06:50.240
Oh, yeah. If I fly to school
transformed in my outfit,

06:50.452 --> 06:54.115
I can get there faster,
without anyone knowing it's me.

06:54.331 --> 06:58.700
|t's faster if I fly on my own.
Kinto Un, let's have a race!

07:01.213 --> 07:03.249
Here we go!

07:03.465 --> 07:06.298
Ready... Go!

07:23.318 --> 07:27.357
Come on, come on, Kinto Un!
I'm going to speed up even faster!

07:38.083 --> 07:41.041
And in no time at all,
I've made it to Satan City.

07:51.346 --> 07:53.132
Reckless driver spotted!

07:55.976 --> 07:58.888
Come on, come on, come on,
outta the way, outta the way!

07:59.104 --> 08:01.095
Floor it! Floor it!

08:05.068 --> 08:07.275
I know I'm already transformed, but...

08:07.487 --> 08:09.318
Transform!

08:19.541 --> 08:22.954
W-Why, you dirty little bastard!
Are you trying to get killed?!

08:23.170 --> 08:25.161
H-How did he just show up there?

08:25.380 --> 08:27.621
That sort of crazy driving will not do!

08:27.841 --> 08:31.629
You almost ran someone over.
Promise me that from now on,

08:31.845 --> 08:33.551
you will drive safely, at least while in the city!

08:33.763 --> 08:36.674
What was that? You and your ridiculous getup!

08:36.892 --> 08:39.634
What kind of nonsense
are you selling, you sicko?!

08:39.852 --> 08:41.342
Who do you think you are?

08:41.563 --> 08:48.059
Huh? W-Who am |? L-Let's see... Um...

08:48.278 --> 08:49.233
Who is this guy?

08:49.446 --> 08:51.061
What a weirdo.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.439
I know!

08:53.658 --> 09:00.029
I am... that lover ofjustice,
the Great Saiyaman!

09:02.667 --> 09:05.158
Great... Saiyaman...?

09:13.637 --> 09:18.347
How lame! I mean, the outfit is lame,
too, but what a lame name!

09:20.560 --> 09:25.395
This guy's touched in the head,
all right! Get him! Get him!

09:25.607 --> 09:28.314
Stop making fun of me!

09:36.826 --> 09:39.738
I thought as hard as I could
to make up that name!

09:44.125 --> 09:48.334
|-|'m sorry. On second thought,
that's a cool name.

09:48.546 --> 09:51.288
We'll drive safely from now on.

09:58.181 --> 10:01.264
Farewell, Great Saiyaman-san!

10:05.981 --> 10:09.519
--Drive safely.
--Drive safely.

10:10.694 --> 10:12.400
I got through to them.

10:14.364 --> 10:18.983
And so, rumors of a new hero,
the Great Saiyaman,

10:19.202 --> 10:23.866
quickly spread through Satan City.

10:24.082 --> 10:27.495
Wah! What's with that outfit, Gohan?!

10:27.711 --> 10:29.542
Mother, don't you like it?

10:29.754 --> 10:32.837
Good grief, how old do you think you are?

10:33.049 --> 10:36.041
You're just like your father in that regard.

10:37.262 --> 10:39.719
I'm home, Mother!

10:39.931 --> 10:43.264
Wow! Brother, that's so cool!

10:43.476 --> 10:45.592
You think so, Goten?

11:09.919 --> 11:14.788
I am the champion ofjustice, Great Saiyaman!

11:15.008 --> 11:21.049
Hmm, it's still missing something.
Maybe the previous one was better.

11:21.264 --> 11:23.175
Big Brother, hang in there.

11:23.391 --> 11:26.724
All right, how about this one?

11:26.936 --> 11:29.973
The heavens call!
The earth cries out! The crowd roars!

11:30.190 --> 11:32.181
All calling on me to strike back against evil!

11:32.400 --> 11:34.857
Do you see this helmet on my head?!

11:35.070 --> 11:39.154
You know I am invincible! The ultimate hero!

11:40.283 --> 11:42.990
The Great Saiyaman!

11:43.203 --> 11:45.865
|-| nailed it.

11:46.081 --> 11:49.118
Wow, Big Brother, that's so cool!

11:50.126 --> 11:51.411
Gohan!

11:51.628 --> 11:53.038
Get to bed already.

11:53.254 --> 11:56.621
If you oversleep and are late gettin'
to school tomorrow, don't blame me.

11:56.841 --> 11:58.832
It's okay, it's okay.

12:01.596 --> 12:03.803
Okay, I'm off!

12:04.015 --> 12:06.427
Come back safely.

12:06.643 --> 12:10.761
Gohan, don't go rushin', now.
Watch out for airplanes.

12:10.980 --> 12:12.481
Right.

12:16.861 --> 12:21.150
That sure is great.
Big Brother, you look so cool!

12:21.366 --> 12:23.903
Mm-hmm. I do, don't I?

12:24.119 --> 12:28.283
Sometime soon, I'll ask Bulma-san
to make one for you, too, Goten.

12:31.376 --> 12:34.584
From now on, you're free to use Kinto Un!

12:34.796 --> 12:36.627
Your brother sure is happy, huh?

12:36.840 --> 12:39.047
He's transformed over
and over since yesterday.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.671
Big Brother is so cool!

12:43.263 --> 12:48.758
This brother of Gohan, who looks
just like Goku, is named Goten.

12:48.977 --> 12:51.013
He is the second child of Goku,

12:51.229 --> 12:55.313
left by him before the battle with Cell.

13:00.113 --> 13:03.480
This is great. I should make it
there in 20 minutes like this.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.444
This is fantastic.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.614
Now I can sleep in a little later.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.442
And, as a result,

13:49.662 --> 13:54.622
this new molecule of energy
is extremely complex...

13:54.834 --> 13:56.370
--Hey, did you hear?
--Huh?

13:56.586 --> 14:00.078
Word is that a new champion
of justice showed up yesterday.

14:00.298 --> 14:02.380
Not that Golden Warrior guy.

14:02.592 --> 14:04.548
Yeah, I heard, I heard.

14:04.761 --> 14:06.922
Hm-hm, they mean me.

14:07.138 --> 14:10.471
He looks ridiculously lame,
but he's supposed to be really strong.

14:10.683 --> 14:13.641
His name is "Great Tireman," I hear.

14:13.853 --> 14:17.220
No, it's not! It's "Great Saiyaman"!

14:20.443 --> 14:23.401
How would you know something like that?

14:24.864 --> 14:29.153
Uh, well, I heard it from someone
who saw him in person.

14:29.369 --> 14:33.487
Is it okay with you if I continue
the lesson, Son Gohan-kun?

14:34.832 --> 14:36.333
Yes!

14:39.796 --> 14:41.787
Yes, this is Videl.

14:42.006 --> 14:46.170
There's been a busjacking!
It's at the East District bus terminal!

14:52.225 --> 14:55.592
A group of three robbers has taken
over a seniors' sightseeing bus,

14:55.812 --> 14:59.020
and have made a ransom demand.
Request immediate--

15:00.233 --> 15:01.973
Hurry up and bring us the ransom!

15:02.193 --> 15:05.310
Or else Grandma and Grandpa's
lives will be over!

15:05.530 --> 15:07.612
Requesting backup!

15:07.824 --> 15:10.110
Copy! I'll be there shortly!

15:10.326 --> 15:11.486
Teacher, I'll be back in a bit!

15:11.703 --> 15:14.786
G-Good work. Be careful, okay?

15:14.998 --> 15:17.535
What's going on with Videl-san?

15:17.750 --> 15:20.127
Videl is a champion ofjustice as a hobby.

15:20.336 --> 15:22.952
Eh?! A champion of justice?

15:23.172 --> 15:27.131
Well, look, she is the daughter of
Mister Satan, who saved the world.

15:27.343 --> 15:31.131
And she's strong, so the police
often ask her for help.

15:31.347 --> 15:34.134
Th-They ask her?

15:35.476 --> 15:40.891
Don't take Videl too lightly.
Her strength is far greater than mine.

15:41.107 --> 15:45.851
In fact, her abilities rival
those of Mister Satan himself.

15:46.070 --> 15:49.187
Strength that rivals Mister Satan?

16:00.293 --> 16:04.878
She could be in danger,
if she's the same as Mister Satan.

16:08.092 --> 16:10.504
--H-Hey, there...
--I need to use the bathroom!

16:17.185 --> 16:18.721
Transform!

16:35.244 --> 16:39.283
W-Where is the bus terminal, anyway?

16:43.336 --> 16:45.748
Boss, we're done loading it on.

16:46.923 --> 16:50.131
We've handed over the ransom,
just as you demanded!

16:50.343 --> 16:53.176
Now release the hostages immediately!

16:54.180 --> 16:55.681
You fools!

16:58.768 --> 16:59.598
Drive us out!

16:59.811 --> 17:01.301
Right!

17:06.442 --> 17:09.354
Don't shoot! You'll hit the hostages!

17:09.569 --> 17:11.526
We'll see you later!

17:16.160 --> 17:21.075
We've finally started going, huh?
I wonder where they're taking us.

17:21.290 --> 17:25.078
Being part of a busjacking is a
new experience for us, after all.

17:25.294 --> 17:27.955
Yeah, the more you live, the more you learn.

17:28.172 --> 17:31.539
Mr. Gangster, look over here,
so I can take a commemorative photo.

17:31.759 --> 17:34.375
You be quiet! You guys are hostages!

17:34.595 --> 17:36.631
Okay, say cheese!

17:37.890 --> 17:40.632
You dumbass! Keep your eyes on the road!

17:52.655 --> 17:54.191
Damn!

18:00.747 --> 18:03.329
Oh, that's Videl-san's heli!

18:03.541 --> 18:06.954
Videl-san, if you please!

18:15.636 --> 18:16.921
Boss! Above us! Above us!

18:17.138 --> 18:18.628
What?!

18:22.935 --> 18:24.891
That's the champion ofjustice, Videl-san!

18:25.104 --> 18:26.480
Grandma, get a picture of this!

18:26.689 --> 18:28.225
Right, right!

18:38.367 --> 18:40.653
Ah, there they are!

18:47.585 --> 18:49.746
She's pretty good, huh?

18:57.178 --> 18:58.668
Damn!

19:00.515 --> 19:04.178
Hey! Why, you rotten...! Take this!

19:04.393 --> 19:06.600
Yeah! Let them have it, Videl-san!

19:06.813 --> 19:08.849
And you hang in there, too, gangsters!

19:09.065 --> 19:12.057

19:18.991 --> 19:21.403
Take that, you lousy jerks!

19:28.334 --> 19:32.668
Oh, Videl-san wins by knockout!

19:32.880 --> 19:34.916
One shot, to remember this by?

19:36.801 --> 19:38.883
Ah! The bus!

20:03.995 --> 20:06.156
|-|t can't be...

20:17.842 --> 20:20.584
Thank you! Thank you!

20:32.231 --> 20:34.222
Wow, that was fun, huh?

20:34.442 --> 20:36.433
A real "hell tour"!

20:36.652 --> 20:39.109
Knock on wood, knock on wood.

20:39.322 --> 20:41.358
Who are you?

20:41.574 --> 20:47.570
I am... the champion ofjustice,
who will not tolerate evil...

20:51.208 --> 20:53.699
Great Saiyaman!

20:59.967 --> 21:01.047
| nailed it perfectly!

21:01.260 --> 21:03.421
I did practice it for two hours
last night, after all.

21:03.638 --> 21:09.725
H-How cheesy. This is the champion
of justice, Great Saiyaman?

21:09.936 --> 21:13.679
Well then, farewell, Videl-san.

21:13.898 --> 21:17.140
How does he know my name?

21:17.360 --> 21:19.100
Goodbye!

21:20.112 --> 21:22.228
A new hero is born.

21:22.448 --> 21:27.238
His name, the champion
of justice, Great Saiyaman.

21:27.453 --> 21:33.073
Can he keep his identity hidden?

22:41.736 --> 22:42.976
Heya! l'm Goku!

22:43.195 --> 22:44.731
Gohan, you sure seem busy,

22:44.947 --> 22:46.483
with all the transforming, and helping people.

22:46.699 --> 22:49.486
Father, champions ofjustice never rest.

22:49.702 --> 22:52.364
Great Saiyaman, you may look absolutely silly,

22:52.580 --> 22:54.787
but I am interested in
your uncommon strength.

22:54.999 --> 22:57.411
I'm going to make sure
I find out who you really are.

22:57.626 --> 22:59.082
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:59.295 --> 23:02.628
"Videl's Crisis?! Son Gohan's Urgent Call-out!"

23:02.840 --> 23:05.957
It sure is hard being a champion ofjustice.
