00:05.967 --> 00:07.527
Previously on
The Shannara Chronicles...

00:08.132 --> 00:09.399
Were you following me?

00:09.400 --> 00:12.066
Wherever you go, I go.

00:12.067 --> 00:14.399
Eretria, you must
let go of your old life.

00:14.400 --> 00:16.766
Wherever Wil and Amberle are,
I'm sure they're safe.

00:16.767 --> 00:20.366
Eretria, a new darkness
is coming.

00:20.367 --> 00:21.699
- Do you know who I am?
- General Riga.

00:21.700 --> 00:23.699
That's right and I'm
on the hunt for magic users.

00:23.700 --> 00:25.266
His name is Wil Ohmsford.

00:25.267 --> 00:26.732
Hey. You look really
familiar. What was your name?

00:26.733 --> 00:29.332
Around here,
I'm just another Healer.

00:29.333 --> 00:30.632
Why do you dedicate
yourself to medicine?

00:30.633 --> 00:33.166
I'm not interested
in saving the world anymore.

00:33.167 --> 00:35.132
Just the people
that I care about.

00:35.133 --> 00:36.532
Wil did come looking for me,
didn't he?

00:36.533 --> 00:38.732
- I was trying to protect you.
- I don't need protection.

00:38.733 --> 00:40.132
I want the truth, for once.

00:40.133 --> 00:41.466
We've got to keep moving.

00:41.467 --> 00:42.766
It's a long way to Arborlon.

00:42.767 --> 00:46.332
Today you will be
reborn... As Mord Wraiths.

00:46.333 --> 00:48.832
Resurrecting the Warlock Lord
is madness.

00:48.833 --> 00:50.532
Find the Shannara.

00:50.533 --> 00:52.567
Shannara.

00:55.133 --> 00:56.300
I'm right here.

00:59.033 --> 01:00.899
We have to hurry before
that thing comes back.

01:00.900 --> 01:02.932
Not until you tell me
what you want.

01:02.933 --> 01:04.099
- Allanon.
- Why?

01:04.099 --> 01:05.099
Because he's my father.

01:18.333 --> 01:20.199
Wil...

01:20.200 --> 01:22.699
We've been running all night.
Let's stop and rest.

01:22.700 --> 01:23.832
We haven't seen
that thing in hours.

01:23.833 --> 01:26.266
We need to get to Shady Vale
and find my uncle.

01:26.267 --> 01:27.767
Then we can rest.

01:28.967 --> 01:30.067
We're almost there. Okay?

01:39.833 --> 01:40.833
They've found us.

01:43.133 --> 01:45.133
Looks like it brought
a friend with it this time.

01:48.933 --> 01:49.933
Faster!

01:50.100 --> 01:51.100
Come on!

01:52.200 --> 01:54.200
Come on! Hurry!

02:04.067 --> 02:06.933
It should be deep enough
this time of year.

02:07.967 --> 02:08.967
Should be?

03:31.833 --> 03:32.900
You okay?

03:37.267 --> 03:38.800
What is this place?

03:41.167 --> 03:43.132
I found it when I was a kid.

03:43.133 --> 03:46.899
I used to skip school
and sneak in here.

03:46.900 --> 03:48.700
It was the only place
I could escape.

03:49.267 --> 03:50.667
Escape from what?

03:52.133 --> 03:53.732
Being different.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.767
I didn't exactly fit in
around here.

03:57.067 --> 03:58.067
Okay.

03:58.633 --> 04:00.632
We need a plan.

04:00.633 --> 04:02.332
I'm not far from Shady Vale.

04:02.333 --> 04:03.532
I'll find my uncle,

04:03.533 --> 04:06.766
then head south
to the Human Federation

04:06.767 --> 04:07.767
and seek sanctuary.

04:08.867 --> 04:10.266
- Sanctuary?
- Yeah.

04:10.267 --> 04:14.099
Do you think those things
give a damn about human laws?

04:14.100 --> 04:15.432
They're after you
because you're magic.

04:15.433 --> 04:17.499
Doesn't take a genius
to figure out

04:17.500 --> 04:18.740
you won't last long if you run.

04:19.433 --> 04:21.798
I was finding it hard to believe

04:21.800 --> 04:23.866
that Allanon
could have a daughter,

04:23.867 --> 04:25.747
but you're sounding
more like him by the minute.

04:34.667 --> 04:37.799
If Allanon's your father,
who's your mother?

04:37.800 --> 04:39.767
She was King Eventine's sister.

04:42.200 --> 04:43.367
Hence the ears.

04:46.067 --> 04:47.067
Pyria?

04:51.100 --> 04:54.899
I, uh, I met her once,
with Allanon.

04:54.900 --> 04:56.267
But he didn't mention
a daughter.

04:57.467 --> 04:58.933
I'm not surprised.

05:00.267 --> 05:01.899
By the time she figured out
she was pregnant,

05:01.900 --> 05:03.367
he had already disappeared.

05:04.867 --> 05:06.599
I didn't even know
he was a Druid

05:06.600 --> 05:08.433
until my magic
started to manifest.

05:09.700 --> 05:12.166
The more I pressed
for information,

05:12.167 --> 05:13.766
the angrier she got.

05:13.767 --> 05:16.933
So, I finally left.

05:18.300 --> 05:21.800
That was the last time
I saw her before she was...

05:26.067 --> 05:27.867
I know what it's like
to lose a mom.

05:30.867 --> 05:32.899
But I haven't seen Allanon
in months,

05:32.900 --> 05:34.566
and I don't plan to,

05:34.567 --> 05:36.832
so coming with me
is a waste of time.

05:36.833 --> 05:39.066
You're a Shannara, he's a Druid,

05:39.067 --> 05:41.299
which makes you my best shot
at tracking him down.

05:41.300 --> 05:42.866
I don't need to
complicate things right now.

05:42.867 --> 05:45.366
Let me make this
really simple for you.

05:45.367 --> 05:48.832
I saved your ass twice,

05:48.833 --> 05:50.366
you're welcome by the way,

05:50.367 --> 05:52.067
so now you owe me.

05:55.500 --> 05:57.767
Sounds like they've given up.

05:58.867 --> 06:01.200
This is the way out.
Keep close.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.666
These guys are Rovers.

06:13.667 --> 06:15.432
I know how they think.

06:15.433 --> 06:16.866
Let me do the talking.

06:16.867 --> 06:18.432
Shut up!

06:18.433 --> 06:19.900
Not another word.

06:37.333 --> 06:38.333
Ladies.

06:39.067 --> 06:40.067
This is your lucky day.

06:41.533 --> 06:44.067
You boys wouldn't be looking
for a fight now, would you?

06:45.200 --> 06:48.067
Because I might be able
to help out with that.

06:48.467 --> 06:49.400
Heads up.

06:49.400 --> 06:50.400
Argh!

07:30.467 --> 07:31.467
Phew!

07:32.967 --> 07:34.267
Sorry to hog all the action.

07:43.067 --> 07:44.099
No doubt you ladies
could've handled

07:44.100 --> 07:45.220
these fools all on your own,

07:47.500 --> 07:49.499
but I couldn't risk them
harming the merchandise.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.332
What merchandise?

07:51.333 --> 07:55.632
Lyria here
has been a very bad girl.

07:55.633 --> 07:57.799
- You're a bounty hunter.
- Ooh.

07:57.800 --> 07:59.099
And you're a quick study.

07:59.100 --> 08:00.340
Well, I can't let you take her.

08:00.667 --> 08:02.533
Jax, wait!

08:05.733 --> 08:06.567
You know who I am?

08:06.568 --> 08:08.899
Then you also know

08:08.900 --> 08:10.899
Garet Jax never waits.

08:10.900 --> 08:13.332
She has nothing to do with this.

08:13.333 --> 08:14.632
Let's say I leave her breathing,

08:14.633 --> 08:16.732
what's in it for me?

08:16.733 --> 08:18.200
What do you want?

08:19.333 --> 08:21.266
What I want...

08:21.267 --> 08:22.632
Is for you
to come along quietly.

08:22.633 --> 08:24.466
I'm not getting paid enough

08:24.467 --> 08:26.147
to carry your spoiled ass
all the way home.

08:26.500 --> 08:28.800
Let's go.

09:02.833 --> 09:05.233
You could have come
to the palace.

09:05.700 --> 09:08.232
It was safer to meet here.

09:08.233 --> 09:11.866
The Crimson have eyes and ears
all over Arborlon.

09:11.867 --> 09:13.027
I'll go patrol the perimeter.

09:16.633 --> 09:18.066
Bandon's alive?

09:18.067 --> 09:18.967
What happened at Skull Mountain?

09:18.968 --> 09:21.699
The boy's magic grows stronger,

09:21.700 --> 09:24.099
corrupted by the Warlock Blade.

09:24.100 --> 09:25.766
It was guiding him
to resurrect his master.

09:25.767 --> 09:27.632
The Warlock Lord?

09:27.633 --> 09:29.899
No, I thought Wil's father

09:29.900 --> 09:30.700
killed him with
the sword of Shannara.

09:30.701 --> 09:33.066
The Warlock Lord took measures

09:33.067 --> 09:35.132
to ensure his death
was not final.

09:35.133 --> 09:38.366
His followers hid his heart,
his head, his blade,

09:38.367 --> 09:41.432
hoping that
he could be re-born.

09:41.433 --> 09:44.499
Shea and I have recovered
his blade and his head,

09:44.500 --> 09:48.067
but his followers got away
with his heart.

09:49.867 --> 09:50.600
Bandon recovered it.

09:50.601 --> 09:52.499
Great.

09:52.500 --> 09:54.499
So he's one piece away
from bringing back

09:54.500 --> 09:55.500
another Dark Druid.

09:56.733 --> 09:59.066
Why didn't you just
destroy the head?

09:59.067 --> 10:00.766
I said the Warlock Lord

10:00.767 --> 10:01.866
took measures to ensure

10:01.867 --> 10:04.366
that wasn't possible.

10:04.367 --> 10:07.566
You do not understand magic,
Your Highness.

10:07.567 --> 10:10.666
The whole thing plays right
into the Crimson's hands.

10:10.667 --> 10:12.532
It confirms everything
General Riga has been saying

10:12.533 --> 10:14.000
about the danger of magic.

10:15.200 --> 10:16.832
At least tell me
you hid that head

10:16.833 --> 10:18.366
in a place
where Bandon can't find it.

10:18.367 --> 10:19.899
Of course, I did.

10:19.900 --> 10:21.799
But do not underestimate
the boy.

10:21.800 --> 10:23.499
We must be ready for him

10:23.500 --> 10:24.233
and you must make sure

10:24.234 --> 10:25.599
that your kingdom does not

10:25.600 --> 10:27.066
fall apart at the seams.

10:27.067 --> 10:29.066
It's easier said than done.

10:29.067 --> 10:30.732
My people are still in camps.

10:30.733 --> 10:35.066
They're tired and,
and afraid and...

10:35.067 --> 10:37.366
And I'm the king
they're left with.

10:37.367 --> 10:38.832
Which many
don't find encouraging

10:38.833 --> 10:41.666
and right now I...
I can hardly blame them.

10:41.667 --> 10:44.132
Then what you need is support.

10:44.133 --> 10:47.332
In their quest
to eradicate magic,

10:47.333 --> 10:48.799
the Crimson will stop
at nothing.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.467
No race will be spared.

10:52.267 --> 10:54.433
Queen Tamlin has reached out
to me.

10:55.233 --> 10:56.133
She's offered an alliance

10:56.134 --> 10:58.299
between the Elves
and the humans.

10:58.300 --> 11:00.200
Then you must speak with her.

11:01.333 --> 11:03.699
But the truth is you
cannot face the Crimson

11:03.700 --> 11:05.667
or the Warlock Lord alone.

11:22.167 --> 11:23.366
Hey, you gotta keep moving.

11:23.367 --> 11:24.832
And stay under the tree canopy.

11:24.833 --> 11:27.433
We can't risk those things
finding us again.

11:29.133 --> 11:30.566
Oh!

11:30.567 --> 11:32.407
Anybody ever tell you
you're a pain in the ass?

11:33.967 --> 11:37.432
Who taught you how to do that?

11:37.433 --> 11:39.900
No one taught me,
I was born this way.

11:41.267 --> 11:43.766
Allanon didn't have
innate magic.

11:43.767 --> 11:45.066
Druids had to learn it.

11:45.067 --> 11:47.799
Yeah. One of
the many mysteries of my life.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.799
I don't know what
you're expecting from him,

11:49.800 --> 11:52.099
but I wouldn't get your hopes
too high.

11:52.100 --> 11:53.832
It's not like I've got
a lot of options.

11:53.833 --> 11:55.899
He's the last Druid and the
only one that can train me.

11:55.900 --> 11:59.099
Magic is overrated. Trust me.

11:59.100 --> 12:02.067
Yeah. Except when
it benefits you, right?

12:03.067 --> 12:05.566
I watched you heal yourself.

12:05.567 --> 12:07.700
Why do you keep avoiding
who you really are?

12:08.500 --> 12:10.866
You have no idea who I am.

12:10.867 --> 12:14.566
I'm an ordinary guy
who wants an ordinary life.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.967
If you want to be ordinary,
then throw away the Elfstones.

12:19.167 --> 12:20.167
You can't, can you?

12:22.067 --> 12:25.066
You have this amazing gift,
but you just abuse it.

12:25.067 --> 12:26.532
I see the marks on your arm.

12:26.533 --> 12:29.066
I know what they mean, so
don't try to give me some line

12:29.067 --> 12:30.767
about the burden of magic.

12:32.367 --> 12:34.167
You're certainly as judgmental
as your father.

12:35.133 --> 12:37.132
Well, when I learn how
to use my magic,

12:37.133 --> 12:39.967
you won't see me
running and hiding.

12:56.500 --> 13:00.066
Behold, the Kingdom of Leah.

13:00.067 --> 13:04.432
When we were boys, I doubt
our fathers ever thought

13:04.433 --> 13:06.232
the future of the Elves
would be on our shoulders.

13:06.233 --> 13:08.067
But history is made
by those who survive.

13:11.700 --> 13:13.232
I hope I'm making
the right decision.

13:13.233 --> 13:15.899
You have no other choice.
But be careful.

13:15.900 --> 13:19.400
Queen Tamlin always has
a hidden agenda.

14:05.133 --> 14:07.066
King Ander.

14:07.067 --> 14:11.666
Last time I saw you was
at your seventeenth birthday.

14:11.667 --> 14:13.432
You were passed out drunk.

14:13.433 --> 14:16.067
Clearly times have changed.

14:16.100 --> 14:17.100
For some of us.

14:19.067 --> 14:20.166
Your beauty remains timeless.

14:20.167 --> 14:22.100
A charmer just like your father.

14:25.233 --> 14:27.067
Let's hope that you are wiser.

14:33.867 --> 14:36.667
You must all be exhausted
after your travels.

14:37.100 --> 14:38.067
Rest now.

14:38.068 --> 14:41.500
I've arranged a feast
in your honor.

14:50.267 --> 14:51.633
Uncle Flick!

14:55.267 --> 14:56.533
Uncle Flick!

14:58.400 --> 14:59.567
Uncle Flick!

15:00.367 --> 15:01.567
Uncle Flick!

15:10.067 --> 15:12.200
Wil...

15:18.900 --> 15:20.067
I thought I'd lost you.

15:21.533 --> 15:23.267
You can't get rid
of me that easy.

15:30.300 --> 15:32.933
All right. I'll fix you up.

15:50.900 --> 15:52.566
Your Majesty.

15:52.567 --> 15:54.132
I've recovered your daughter.

15:54.133 --> 15:57.399
She's safe and sound
and back in her gilded cage.

15:57.400 --> 15:59.067
You haven't disappointed me yet.

16:00.633 --> 16:03.332
My offer of a permanent
position is still open.

16:03.333 --> 16:04.899
How sweet.

16:04.900 --> 16:07.399
But I'm not looking to be
anybody's lapdog.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.299
I'm strictly freelance.

16:09.300 --> 16:12.166
You're welcome to join us
at the banquet tonight.

16:12.167 --> 16:13.666
Thanks.

16:13.667 --> 16:16.232
But the royal bordello
is more my style.

16:16.233 --> 16:17.532
As you wish.

16:17.533 --> 16:19.133
Always a pleasure, Jax.

16:37.767 --> 16:41.932
General Riga, the Shannara has
been spotted near Storlock.

16:41.933 --> 16:44.133
Take a patrol.
Retrieve him immediately.

16:49.900 --> 16:52.733
We have word
that the Druid is in Leah.

16:54.233 --> 16:55.967
You and I will handle the Druid.

17:01.333 --> 17:04.165
We need to head south
to Arishaig.

17:04.166 --> 17:07.965
We can seek asylum with the
Federation until this is over.

17:07.967 --> 17:09.199
Asylum?

17:09.200 --> 17:12.166
If we don't stand up
against these men, who will?

17:13.233 --> 17:14.767
It's not just the Crimson.

17:15.767 --> 17:17.299
Tell him about the Demons, Wil.

17:17.300 --> 17:18.633
Demons?

17:19.800 --> 17:22.066
They chased us out of Storlock.

17:22.067 --> 17:23.547
Red and black smoke trails
in the sky.

17:26.200 --> 17:27.333
Mord Wraiths.

17:27.700 --> 17:30.300
Servants of the Warlock Lord.

17:31.067 --> 17:32.832
That's impossible.

17:32.833 --> 17:36.366
Allanon and my father defeated
the Warlock Lord 30 years ago.

17:36.367 --> 17:37.767
That's not the whole story.

17:38.300 --> 17:39.300
How do you know?

17:43.367 --> 17:44.933
Because I was there, Wil.

18:13.500 --> 18:16.799
You know,
you can dress me up, Mother,

18:16.800 --> 18:18.967
but you can't force me
to change.

18:19.867 --> 18:22.066
Just smile and nod.

18:22.067 --> 18:24.233
Conversation isn't
your strong suit.

18:32.500 --> 18:34.300
She's so beautiful!

18:37.867 --> 18:39.467
She's gorgeous.

18:44.133 --> 18:49.066
King Ander, please allow me to
introduce my daughter, Lyria,

18:49.067 --> 18:50.666
Princess of Leah.

18:50.667 --> 18:51.800
The pleasure is mine.

18:53.900 --> 18:54.933
Truly.

19:07.267 --> 19:11.133
When the Demons came,
we refused Arborlon's call.

19:12.967 --> 19:14.299
But the reality is,
we wouldn't be alive

19:14.300 --> 19:16.433
if it weren't for the bravery
of the Elves.

19:18.533 --> 19:21.966
I'd like to toast King Ander,

19:21.967 --> 19:25.232
for his courage
in forging this alliance.

19:25.233 --> 19:26.933
Hear, hear!

20:45.467 --> 20:46.467
Oh.

20:47.467 --> 20:50.532
I should've put you in the
ground when I had the chance.

20:50.533 --> 20:51.653
How'd you get in the palace?

20:53.267 --> 20:54.832
I'm very resourceful.

20:54.833 --> 20:56.466
Mmm.

20:56.467 --> 20:58.532
Where's Lyria?

20:58.533 --> 21:00.766
You like to play dirty.
I like that.

21:00.767 --> 21:02.499
I'm not playing. Where is she?

21:02.500 --> 21:04.900
Safe. That's all
you need to know.

21:07.400 --> 21:10.300
Which ear would you like me
to slice off first?

21:13.567 --> 21:16.632
My advice?

21:16.633 --> 21:20.099
Take your bag of Rover tricks
and go home.

21:20.100 --> 21:21.832
Ooh!

21:21.833 --> 21:24.967
I'm not leaving until you tell
me where the hell she is.

21:26.067 --> 21:27.067
Wait.

21:28.133 --> 21:30.433
You're in love with her,
aren't you?

21:34.133 --> 21:35.167
Okay.

21:35.667 --> 21:37.100
Okay.

21:40.267 --> 21:41.832
You're lucky.

21:41.833 --> 21:45.500
I have a soft spot
for hopeless romantics.

21:53.400 --> 21:56.300
I know you and my father
didn't always see eye to eye,

21:56.633 --> 21:59.666
but I'd like to change that.

21:59.667 --> 22:03.899
His policies did nothing
but isolate the Elves.

22:03.900 --> 22:06.199
Nobody understands that
more than me.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.099
Then act like it.

22:08.100 --> 22:11.566
The Crimson grow more brazen
by the day.

22:11.567 --> 22:14.366
The other races have dismissed
the threat as an Elven issue.

22:14.367 --> 22:16.533
The Crimson attack human
and Elf alike.

22:17.667 --> 22:19.499
Left unchallenged,

22:19.500 --> 22:21.166
they will bring
the Four Lands to its knees.

22:21.167 --> 22:23.066
I agree.

22:23.067 --> 22:26.532
We must find a way
to persuade the other races

22:26.533 --> 22:28.566
that this is their fight too.

22:28.567 --> 22:29.900
What do you suggest?

22:30.467 --> 22:32.666
A true alliance.

22:32.667 --> 22:35.099
One that sets aside years
of prejudice

22:35.100 --> 22:37.433
and brings our races together.

22:37.567 --> 22:40.233
One that's bound by blood.

22:49.933 --> 22:51.632
You want me to marry
your daughter?

22:51.633 --> 22:55.267
I want Lyria on the throne
in Arborlon.

22:56.300 --> 22:59.299
The sooner the marriage
is official,

22:59.300 --> 23:02.067
the sooner you can secure
your people's future.

23:44.567 --> 23:45.733
Eretria?

23:46.300 --> 23:47.466
How did you...

23:47.467 --> 23:48.827
You don't get
to ask the questions.

23:52.333 --> 23:52.967
Why did you lie to me?

23:52.967 --> 23:53.967
I didn't.

23:56.333 --> 23:58.132
I told you that I hated
the person that I used to be.

23:58.133 --> 24:00.967
You were a little light
on the details.

24:03.733 --> 24:04.733
A princess.

24:06.367 --> 24:08.866
Was what we had even real?

24:08.867 --> 24:10.066
The person I was with you?

24:10.067 --> 24:13.232
That's the real me.

24:13.233 --> 24:16.666
I thought I had finally
escaped this place,

24:16.667 --> 24:18.900
that I was free
to live my own life.

24:19.067 --> 24:21.067
But my mother had another idea.

24:23.633 --> 24:25.933
She brought me back
to marry some Elven king.

24:27.667 --> 24:29.700
She wants me on the throne
in Arborlon.

24:31.100 --> 24:33.433
You're marrying Ander?

24:34.067 --> 24:37.066
Look, this isn't
what I want, okay?

24:37.067 --> 24:39.332
My mother hates the Elves.

24:39.333 --> 24:40.866
This alliance is some kind
of maneuver.

24:40.867 --> 24:44.332
How dare you burst in here!

24:44.333 --> 24:45.599
Leave her alone.

24:45.600 --> 24:47.066
We're under strict orders
from the Queen.

24:47.067 --> 24:49.187
If you really care about me,
tell King Ander I'm here!

25:12.100 --> 25:14.100
My daughter has a weakness
for feisty brunettes.

25:16.067 --> 25:18.499
When she ran away the last time,

25:18.500 --> 25:20.532
it was with a scullery maid.

25:20.533 --> 25:23.066
Before that, an innkeeper's son.

25:23.067 --> 25:25.799
I suppose she forgot
to mention them to you.

25:25.800 --> 25:28.099
She forgot to mention
a lot of things.

25:28.100 --> 25:29.766
Did she feed you the line

25:29.767 --> 25:31.567
that she only felt real
when she was with you?

25:36.633 --> 25:38.233
Nothing holds Lyria's
attention for long.

25:39.800 --> 25:41.732
It's not your fault.

25:41.733 --> 25:44.500
She goes through lovers
like she goes through outfits.

25:45.200 --> 25:46.600
I don't believe you.

25:58.167 --> 26:00.266
Leave my kingdom,

26:00.267 --> 26:02.532
forget you ever knew
my daughter,

26:02.533 --> 26:04.967
and the diamonds are yours
to keep.

26:05.967 --> 26:08.366
What if I can't be bought?

26:08.367 --> 26:10.600
Then you'll face
the wrong end of a blade.

26:27.067 --> 26:29.366
Last chance, old man.

26:29.367 --> 26:30.367
Where is the Shannara?

26:31.933 --> 26:33.600
We know he was here.

26:38.600 --> 26:41.667
You want to die for some
half-breed magic user?

26:43.233 --> 26:44.266
Suit yourself.

26:44.267 --> 26:46.567
Sorry to interrupt.

26:47.467 --> 26:48.900
Who the hell are you?

27:09.200 --> 27:10.200
What are you?

27:11.733 --> 27:13.300
Something you'll
never comprehend.

27:24.400 --> 27:26.567
Wil has an uncle in Shady Vale.

27:28.467 --> 27:30.300
You got what you wanted.

27:30.467 --> 27:33.200
Now you can finish
what they started.

27:37.667 --> 27:40.366
My fight isn't with you.

27:40.367 --> 27:42.666
But prepare yourself
for the war to come

27:42.667 --> 27:45.599
because once
the Warlock Lord returns,

27:45.600 --> 27:47.067
no one will be safe.

28:11.967 --> 28:15.066
Shea and I were loyal brothers.

28:15.067 --> 28:18.066
When he was called by Allanon
to face the Warlock Lord...

28:18.067 --> 28:21.532
I couldn't let him go alone.

28:21.533 --> 28:23.300
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

28:25.067 --> 28:29.867
When Shea left, after the war,
he asked me to watch over you.

28:30.700 --> 28:32.599
To raise you as my own.

28:32.600 --> 28:35.267
And he made me promise
to tell you nothing of magic.

28:37.400 --> 28:40.066
He wanted to keep you safe.

28:40.067 --> 28:41.507
But I can't
protect you anymore, Wil.

28:43.967 --> 28:45.432
Whether your father
accepted it or not,

28:45.433 --> 28:47.067
you share his calling.

28:49.533 --> 28:51.833
Do you still have the Elfstones?

28:58.767 --> 29:01.366
I know you told me
to get rid of them, but...

29:01.367 --> 29:02.367
I was wrong.

29:04.533 --> 29:06.600
You said they drove
my father mad.

29:09.167 --> 29:10.767
It wasn't the stones
that drove Shea mad.

29:14.367 --> 29:15.599
Denying his purpose,

29:15.600 --> 29:17.333
wallowing in regret,

29:18.533 --> 29:21.067
that's what killed your father.

29:39.533 --> 29:40.933
You've been quiet
since we got back.

29:41.567 --> 29:44.133
Did something happen
with the Queen?

29:45.600 --> 29:47.466
Let's just say, Tamlin lived
up to her reputation

29:47.467 --> 29:49.733
as a tough negotiator.

29:51.667 --> 29:54.632
Out on the balcony,
when we were talking terms...

29:54.633 --> 29:56.766
She said she wouldn't agree
to the alliance

29:56.767 --> 29:58.167
unless you married her daughter.

29:59.333 --> 30:00.932
- How did you...
- I spent my life

30:00.933 --> 30:03.032
in the Palace as
a handmaiden to your family.

30:03.033 --> 30:06.199
I got a front row seat
to royal politics.

30:06.200 --> 30:08.833
I won't spend the rest of my
life in a loveless marriage.

30:09.433 --> 30:10.733
Not for anything.

30:11.767 --> 30:15.732
This is about the survival
of the Elves.

30:15.733 --> 30:18.367
Your father,
your brother, Amberle...

30:20.433 --> 30:21.732
They all gave their lives

30:21.733 --> 30:23.700
so that we could build
a better world.

30:25.600 --> 30:26.800
It's time we start doing that.

30:36.433 --> 30:38.767
Can I help you, Princess?

30:43.500 --> 30:44.633
Eretria!

30:46.667 --> 30:49.067
This woman is a hero
in the War of the Forbidding.

30:49.700 --> 30:51.700
Inform Queen Tamlin that
she's under my protection.

30:54.133 --> 30:55.566
Is Wil with you?

30:55.567 --> 30:56.767
I have a message from Amberle.

31:00.367 --> 31:01.367
You don't know?

31:02.533 --> 31:04.267
Know what?

31:12.900 --> 31:13.533
Sir...

31:13.534 --> 31:15.499
If you'll excuse me.

31:15.500 --> 31:18.800
Whatever you need.
You're family now.

31:24.500 --> 31:27.900
Amberle...
The Ellcrys spoke to me.

31:29.400 --> 31:31.199
In what way?

31:31.200 --> 31:32.799
I had a vision.

31:32.800 --> 31:34.466
She said Wil was in danger.

31:34.467 --> 31:36.700
That's why I came back.

31:38.933 --> 31:41.432
I'd hoped to spare Wil
from further conflict,

31:41.433 --> 31:43.366
but if the Ellcrys
has sent warning,

31:43.367 --> 31:46.099
I can wait no more.

31:46.100 --> 31:47.666
If the Warlock Lord returns,

31:47.667 --> 31:49.799
Wil is the only one
who can stop him.

31:49.800 --> 31:51.866
Which means Bandon
will be looking for him.

31:51.867 --> 31:53.232
Bandon?

31:53.233 --> 31:54.499
What does he have
to do with this?

31:54.500 --> 31:57.066
I will explain on the way
to Shady Vale.

31:57.067 --> 31:58.299
Wil is there.

31:58.300 --> 32:00.100
I have sensed
the Elfstones' presence.

32:07.067 --> 32:08.167
Eretria.

32:17.667 --> 32:20.067
I sense you two
have things to discuss.

32:21.533 --> 32:22.693
Make sure she's not too long.

32:25.467 --> 32:27.900
I'll be in the hall.

32:29.500 --> 32:32.566
Look, I'm sorry that I lied.

32:32.567 --> 32:34.200
And I'm sorry I hurt you...

32:35.767 --> 32:38.066
But it doesn't have
to end like this.

32:38.067 --> 32:39.799
Is that what you told
the innkeeper's son

32:39.800 --> 32:40.866
or the scullery maid?

32:40.867 --> 32:43.767
My mother is just trying
to drive us apart.

32:44.733 --> 32:45.733
Was she lying about them?

32:47.700 --> 32:49.833
No. But it's different
with you.

32:50.567 --> 32:52.067
What we have is special.

32:52.700 --> 32:54.067
Then prove it.

32:55.367 --> 32:56.600
Leave with me tonight.

32:58.467 --> 33:00.599
You don't know Tamlin.

33:00.600 --> 33:04.267
My mother would hunt us down
and kill you.

33:14.367 --> 33:16.667
Let's go, there's nothing
left for me here.

33:28.567 --> 33:29.933
Allanon.

33:36.900 --> 33:39.100
The last Druid of Paranor.

33:46.833 --> 33:49.732
Since I was a boy,
I dreamed of meeting a Druid.

33:49.733 --> 33:53.166
I've read your histories,
studied your texts.

33:53.167 --> 33:54.267
General Riga.

33:55.467 --> 33:56.667
The madman behind the Crimson.

34:00.667 --> 34:01.767
I will give you one chance.

34:02.633 --> 34:05.300
Surrender willingly.

34:06.333 --> 34:07.733
Oh, there's no need for that.

34:08.733 --> 34:10.867
Your magic won't affect me.

34:44.300 --> 34:45.300
Wil!

34:47.433 --> 34:50.600
Wil, we have to
get out of here now!

34:54.067 --> 34:56.099
That collar is never
to come off.

34:56.100 --> 34:57.100
It blocks his magic.

34:58.633 --> 35:00.233
Get him back to Graymark.

35:06.767 --> 35:08.599
- Where's Graymark?
- No idea.

35:08.600 --> 35:12.432
But those are definitely
members of the Crimson.

35:12.433 --> 35:13.566
Tell Ander
that Allanon's been taken.

35:13.567 --> 35:14.433
He must send a patrol.

35:14.434 --> 35:16.699
What about you?

35:16.700 --> 35:18.180
I have to find Wil
before Bandon does.

35:30.800 --> 35:32.099
Where's King Ander?

35:32.100 --> 35:34.232
Meeting with Queen Tamlin
to accept her terms.

35:34.233 --> 35:35.466
Why? What's going on?

35:35.467 --> 35:36.899
Allanon was taken
by the Crimson.

35:36.900 --> 35:38.066
Someone set him up.
They were

35:38.067 --> 35:39.067
waiting for him at the stables.

35:39.068 --> 35:40.866
We need to tell
the King immediately.

35:40.867 --> 35:42.532
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Are you sure?

35:42.533 --> 35:43.766
Yes! I saw it myself.

35:43.767 --> 35:45.799
Who else knows this?

35:45.800 --> 35:48.066
No one.
I came straight here. What...

35:48.067 --> 35:49.967
You did
the right thing, Catania.

35:50.533 --> 35:51.533
What?

36:17.800 --> 36:19.066
No, save your magic.

36:19.067 --> 36:22.266
You'll just be sending up
a signal of where we are.

36:22.267 --> 36:23.766
Can those things be killed?

36:23.767 --> 36:25.233
Not in smoke form.

36:27.267 --> 36:28.366
Trust me on this.

36:28.367 --> 36:30.167
Well, we can't just stay
out here in the open.

36:30.567 --> 36:33.100
We can take cover in the barn.

36:34.333 --> 36:35.333
Let's go.

36:36.833 --> 36:37.567
What are you doing?

36:37.568 --> 36:39.966
Buying you some more time.

36:39.967 --> 36:41.233
Get your uncle out of here.

36:44.400 --> 36:46.133
Bring it on, bitches!

37:34.433 --> 37:36.967
Shannara.

37:37.667 --> 37:38.967
Stay back.

37:54.567 --> 37:56.067
- We need to run.
- Okay.

38:03.767 --> 38:05.366
Someone's a little rusty.

38:05.367 --> 38:06.967
What the hell are you
doing here, Bandon?

38:07.667 --> 38:10.400
Embracing my destiny.

38:13.067 --> 38:14.067
That thing belong to you?

38:15.700 --> 38:17.467
They belong to the Warlock Lord.

38:19.733 --> 38:21.599
It helped me find you.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.866
Why? What do you want?

38:23.867 --> 38:25.333
I want justice.

38:27.133 --> 38:29.899
For magic users like us, Wil,

38:29.900 --> 38:32.300
hunted by people
who don't understand.

38:33.167 --> 38:36.800
Abused by men like Allanon.

38:38.900 --> 38:41.132
I'm sorry about
what happened to you,

38:41.133 --> 38:42.932
but Allanon was trying to help.

38:42.933 --> 38:44.232
Is that what you tell yourself

38:44.233 --> 38:46.133
every time you dream of Amberle?

38:47.533 --> 38:48.666
When you think about the friends

38:48.667 --> 38:50.067
and family that you lost?

38:50.633 --> 38:51.766
He lied to us.

38:51.767 --> 38:53.832
Don't listen to him, Wil.

38:53.833 --> 38:55.233
No, he doesn't
have to say anything.

38:56.933 --> 38:57.933
I can hear his thoughts.

39:09.433 --> 39:11.900
You blame the Druid
for Amberle's death.

39:14.967 --> 39:16.766
Stay out of my head.

39:16.767 --> 39:18.633
The Warlock Lord
can teach us, Wil.

39:20.300 --> 39:22.933
He can help us reach
our full potential.

39:24.167 --> 39:26.233
He could even
bring Amberle back for you.

39:26.867 --> 39:27.967
Don't you want that?

39:35.500 --> 39:36.533
Mmm. Uh-uh-uh.

39:41.800 --> 39:44.067
I like you, Wil.

39:45.933 --> 39:47.900
You were kind to me
when no one else was.

39:49.733 --> 39:53.067
But you have something that
belongs to the Warlock Lord.

39:54.900 --> 39:56.200
Tell me where to find it.

39:58.500 --> 39:59.500
The skull!

40:01.067 --> 40:03.432
He told me you knew
where they hid it.

40:03.433 --> 40:04.993
Well, then you got
some bad information.

40:14.733 --> 40:16.367
I don't understand.

40:23.800 --> 40:24.967
Argh!

40:26.900 --> 40:28.400
You're hiding something.

40:30.367 --> 40:31.432
Tell me!

40:31.433 --> 40:32.799
Please!

40:32.800 --> 40:33.967
Wait!

40:34.900 --> 40:35.733
I know what you're looking for.

40:35.734 --> 40:38.132
Just let the boy go.

40:38.133 --> 40:41.600
I was with Allanon
when the Warlock Lord fell.

40:42.767 --> 40:45.433
I helped him hide the skull.

40:59.300 --> 41:00.333
Of course.

41:01.767 --> 41:03.533
The Shannara wasn't Wil.

41:03.800 --> 41:05.933
It was his father.

41:10.067 --> 41:11.067
The skull is in Paranor.

41:13.067 --> 41:18.299
Locked in a magical safe
which I can't open.

41:18.300 --> 41:22.067
No, but a Druid
and a Shannara can.

41:24.167 --> 41:26.633
Find Allanon
and bring him to Druids' Keep.

41:27.400 --> 41:28.666
Why would I do that?

41:28.667 --> 41:30.967
You know that
all of this is his fault...

41:32.967 --> 41:35.067
And because you love your uncle.

41:37.800 --> 41:38.899
Argh!

41:38.900 --> 41:40.766
Whoa!

41:40.767 --> 41:41.767
You let him go!

41:54.800 --> 41:56.500
You have three days, Wil.

41:57.167 --> 41:58.200
Bring me the Druid...

41:58.900 --> 42:00.467
Or your uncle dies.
