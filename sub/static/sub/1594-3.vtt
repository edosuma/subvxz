12:47.166 --> 12:48.567
Yeah, and we had
a nice time, okay?

12:48.567 --> 12:50.200
Tony's sweet.
And he has a real job.

12:50.200 --> 12:51.767
(snoring)

12:51.767 --> 12:54.266
I'm sorry, I totally fell asleep
when you were talking about him.

12:54.266 --> 12:56.000
How long was I out for?
FIONA:
Lip, phone.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.367
And what exactly does
"hooked up" mean?

12:58.367 --> 13:01.000
Last time I checked,
penis goes into vagina.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.300
Wow!

13:02.300 --> 13:04.767
No, okay. We're going to have
oatmeal this morning.

13:04.767 --> 13:06.600
Go get the hot plate.

13:06.600 --> 13:08.633
Jesus, you sure didn't
waste any time, did you?

13:12.166 --> 13:13.700
Here you go, sweetie.

13:13.700 --> 13:15.734
Thank you.
You're welcome.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.333
And I am off to the store.

13:22.333 --> 13:23.467
Does anyone need anything?

13:23.467 --> 13:24.467
The store?

13:24.467 --> 13:26.433
I thought you ne...
(loud kick)

13:26.433 --> 13:29.100
Ow! Christ in a basket!

13:29.100 --> 13:32.166
I have a feeling that today's
going to be the day, Mom.

13:32.166 --> 13:35.200
I think so, too, sweetie.
I think so, too.
Ah.

13:35.200 --> 13:39.367
All right, well, get me a case
of Old Style tall boys, will ya?

13:41.166 --> 13:43.367
Okay.

13:43.367 --> 13:44.600
(muttering):
Old Style tall boys...

13:44.600 --> 13:46.500
Tall boys.

13:46.500 --> 13:50.567
Okay, so, I'm off.

13:50.567 --> 13:53.200
Okay, just one foot
in front of the other.

13:53.200 --> 13:57.367
And I will open the door.

14:04.300 --> 14:09.133
Open the door,
and I take a step out...

14:11.000 --> 14:13.033
(traffic passing)

14:13.033 --> 14:15.266
(truck horn blaring)

14:15.266 --> 14:17.367
(traffic grows louder)

14:17.367 --> 14:18.667
(car horn honking)

14:18.667 --> 14:20.600
(people yelling)

14:20.600 --> 14:22.266
(traffic roaring)

14:22.266 --> 14:24.767
(loud jackhammering)

14:24.767 --> 14:27.200
(Sheila screaming)

14:27.200 --> 14:28.233
Mom!

14:28.233 --> 14:29.533
Mom. Okay...

14:29.533 --> 14:31.000
I've got you, Mom.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.166
I'm right here.

14:32.166 --> 14:33.667
(sobbing)

14:38.700 --> 14:41.433
Okay.

14:41.433 --> 14:42.600
(Sheila sniffles)

14:42.600 --> 14:44.700
KAREN: You're right here.
You're in your house.

14:44.700 --> 14:49.100
(murmurs)
I thought today
was the day.

14:49.100 --> 14:51.066
Maybe next
time, Mom.

14:52.233 --> 14:53.734
Okay.
Maybe next time.

14:53.734 --> 14:57.000
I'm going to go
to the grocery store for you.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.066
No, no, no, no, I'll go.

15:00.066 --> 15:02.367
Karen... let... uh,
let me go for you.

15:02.367 --> 15:04.000
No, that's okay.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.333
No, no, no, no, no.

15:05.333 --> 15:08.266
You do something for me later,
like bail me out of jail.

15:08.266 --> 15:10.033
Frank?

15:10.033 --> 15:12.166
Or stop me from having sex
with some ugly chick.

15:12.166 --> 15:13.467
Frank?
Yeah?

15:13.467 --> 15:15.266
You forgot the list.

15:15.266 --> 15:16.433
No, I-I...

15:16.433 --> 15:17.700
Okay, yeah.

15:20.333 --> 15:22.200
All right.

15:24.200 --> 15:26.667
I think I can
see my breath.

15:26.667 --> 15:30.166
We need $587, or they won't
turn the gas back on.

15:30.166 --> 15:33.700
I'm taking the PSATs for some
Polish kid over in Ridgedale.

15:33.700 --> 15:36.266
He's supposed to give me,
like, a hundred bucks.

15:36.266 --> 15:39.166
I saw online that we can
get an extra $200 a month

15:39.166 --> 15:40.333
from the state if we say

15:40.333 --> 15:41.467
Carl's retarded.

15:41.467 --> 15:42.600
(blubbering)

15:42.600 --> 15:44.033
I get paid Friday.

15:44.033 --> 15:46.033
Okay, I'll figure
out the rest.

15:46.033 --> 15:47.700
School! Let's go.

15:47.700 --> 15:49.133
Everyone out.
I can loan you the money.

15:49.133 --> 15:51.700
Unless you want to get
it from Tony the cop.

15:51.700 --> 15:53.166
You're still here?

15:53.166 --> 15:55.166
Pay me back whenever-- or not.
Doesn't matter.

15:55.166 --> 15:57.166
Let's go. You're
going to be late. Go.

15:57.166 --> 15:58.300
Everyone out.

15:58.300 --> 15:59.600
You, too. Out.

15:59.600 --> 16:02.066
You know, I could borrow
a couple grand from you, Steve,

16:02.066 --> 16:03.133
and not pay you back.

16:03.133 --> 16:04.700
Is this a rebound thing
with Tony?

16:04.700 --> 16:07.367
None of your business.
Does he know
the only reason you fucked him

16:07.367 --> 16:09.467
was to get back at me?
Get out.

16:09.467 --> 16:12.433
LIP: Dude, you're
such a rookie.

16:12.433 --> 16:13.500
Is that your "A" game?

16:13.500 --> 16:15.100
Bye, Fiona. Have a good one.

16:20.533 --> 16:22.000
Fi, this oatmeal...

16:22.000 --> 16:24.066
I don't know what you
did with this oatmeal...

16:25.633 --> 16:27.600
Thanks.
(door closing)

16:28.667 --> 16:30.266
FIONA:
What are you doing here?

16:31.233 --> 16:33.000
Don't you have a new home?

16:33.000 --> 16:35.767
I wanted to spend some quality
time with my loving family.

16:35.767 --> 16:38.000
Good, then you can
spend it with Liam

16:38.000 --> 16:41.233
while I go to work.
I can't. Busy day today.

16:41.233 --> 16:42.734
Doing what?

16:42.734 --> 16:45.033
There's a lot that goes
on behind the scenes

16:45.033 --> 16:48.400
to keep this family running that
you wouldn't know about, Fi...

16:48.400 --> 16:50.767
Tits, it's cold in here.
Why are you taking our food?

16:50.767 --> 16:52.266
My food, you mean?

16:52.266 --> 16:54.300
No, I mean, our food.

16:54.300 --> 16:56.633
Which you paid for
with food stamps

16:56.633 --> 16:58.233
that are funded by taxes

16:58.233 --> 17:00.567
that I pay.
Since when?

17:00.567 --> 17:02.100
You live here now?

17:02.100 --> 17:03.367
Toaster.

17:03.367 --> 17:05.100
(knocking)

17:07.567 --> 17:09.100
Hi.

17:09.100 --> 17:10.567
Hey.

17:16.734 --> 17:19.533
To serve and protect, huh?

17:19.533 --> 17:22.166
Serve and protect.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.600
Kevin.

17:27.533 --> 17:28.767
I see you got the flowers.

17:28.767 --> 17:31.033
Yep. They're beautiful.

17:33.700 --> 17:36.667
I had a really
good time last night.
Me, too.

17:36.667 --> 17:40.133
I like you, Fiona.
Thanks, Tony.

17:42.233 --> 17:45.166
I've waited a long time
for last night to happen.

17:45.166 --> 17:47.266
FRANK: See ya.
Coach of the
Year's a big deal.

17:47.266 --> 17:49.500
Out of butter.
Last night was
my first time.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.767
I'm sure you'll win again.

17:51.767 --> 17:54.467
No. In the car.
That was my first time.

17:54.467 --> 17:55.533
First time?

17:55.533 --> 17:58.300
You mean first time with me?

17:58.300 --> 18:00.000
No. First time ever.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.266
But you've been
with other girls.

18:02.266 --> 18:05.133
Not in that way.

18:05.133 --> 18:07.033
Tony, are you saying you were...

18:07.033 --> 18:08.633
Virgin?!
Yep.

18:08.633 --> 18:10.734
Holy shit!
You popped his cherry.

18:10.734 --> 18:12.734
And how was the 30
seconds of bliss?

18:12.734 --> 18:14.533
He actually lasted a while.

18:14.533 --> 18:15.633
Did he cry after?

18:15.633 --> 18:17.567
Oh, leave him alone.

18:17.567 --> 18:19.100
He's a nice guy.

18:19.100 --> 18:21.367
Oh so, it was a mercy fuck?

18:21.367 --> 18:24.533
Or did you sleep with Tony
to get back at Steve?
What?

18:24.533 --> 18:27.533
Come on, I saw the way
you looked at Steve.
Like a D-O-G in heat.

18:27.533 --> 18:30.500
Not true.
You never looked at
the other 95 guys that way.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.600
Don't exaggerate. 94.

18:33.600 --> 18:36.066
You should cut Steve
some slack. He meant well.

18:36.066 --> 18:38.300
You mean when he shipped my
father off to a foreign country?

18:38.300 --> 18:40.734
Yes, the foreign country
of Canada.

18:40.734 --> 18:42.633
At least Tony's not
coming here

18:42.633 --> 18:44.567
getting all in my
family's business.

18:44.567 --> 18:46.100
Maybe that's what I want.

18:46.100 --> 18:47.367
I'm sure Tony's mother
would love that.

18:47.367 --> 18:50.066
I hope he didn't tell
her about last night.

18:50.066 --> 18:51.433
I'm sure the neighborhood
bitches did.

18:51.433 --> 18:53.033
They saw us in the car.

18:53.033 --> 18:55.066
You did it in a car?

18:55.066 --> 18:57.100
How romantic.

18:57.100 --> 18:58.100
(laughing)

18:58.100 --> 18:59.700
(knocking)

18:59.700 --> 19:01.734
Oh, shit. That's probably
Tony's mother right there.

19:01.734 --> 19:04.300
Careful.

19:04.300 --> 19:06.233
Bitch might have a gun.

19:07.066 --> 19:09.300
(laughing)

19:09.300 --> 19:11.633
Yes?

19:11.633 --> 19:13.200
Hi, my name's Abby Ruggiero.

19:13.200 --> 19:15.100
Okay.

19:15.100 --> 19:16.200
Can I speak with Virginia,
please?

19:16.200 --> 19:17.333
Who?

19:17.333 --> 19:20.133
Virginia Louise Gallagher?

19:20.133 --> 19:21.500
Isn't this her house?

19:21.500 --> 19:22.667
Oh, Aunt Ginger.

19:22.667 --> 19:24.433
Is she here?

19:24.433 --> 19:25.600
Nope.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.667
She lives in a nursing
home in Wisconsin.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.500
Well, I'm from the Office

19:29.500 --> 19:30.734
of the Inspector General.

19:30.734 --> 19:33.133
We investigate instances

19:33.133 --> 19:35.467
of, uh, Social Security
related fraud.

19:35.467 --> 19:38.600
I have reason to believe
someone may be cashing
your aunt's checks

19:38.600 --> 19:39.633
without her consent.

19:39.633 --> 19:43.233
Now, 12 years ago
your aunt changed her address

19:43.233 --> 19:45.033
to a Mailboxes, Etc.

19:45.033 --> 19:47.266
12 years ago?
And you're here now?

19:49.367 --> 19:51.500
Oh...

19:53.367 --> 19:56.166
I got to go,
but call me.
Okay.

19:57.233 --> 20:00.133
Look, I'm sure that
my aunt's mail's

20:00.133 --> 20:02.700
being forwarded to
her in Wisconsin.

20:02.700 --> 20:05.300
All right, I'll tell you
what we're gonna do here, miss.

20:05.300 --> 20:08.500
I have your aunt's next Social
Security check with me now.

20:08.500 --> 20:12.266
How about I come back in the
morning, say around 10:00,

20:12.266 --> 20:14.400
and deliver the check
to your aunt in person?

20:14.400 --> 20:17.767
That way I can meet her,
ask a few questions,

20:17.767 --> 20:20.166
and clear this
whole thing up.

20:24.667 --> 20:27.066

Oh. Thank you.

21:45.200 --> 21:47.066
His focus is math,

21:47.066 --> 21:49.066
and he wants to get into
the National Merit Society.

21:49.066 --> 21:50.300
Got it.

21:50.300 --> 21:53.133
Also, I told Richie that
your rates went up,

21:53.133 --> 21:54.333
so he's giving you $150.

21:54.333 --> 21:57.000
You're good.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.467

What do you think, Kev?

22:09.734 --> 22:11.333
(sportscast playing)

22:11.333 --> 22:13.333
I have no idea.

22:13.333 --> 22:15.367
It's "joker."

22:15.367 --> 22:17.000
Where the hell
is Aunt Ginger, Dad?

22:17.000 --> 22:19.066
And hello to you,
too, my firstborn.

22:19.066 --> 22:20.233
KEV:
How you doing?

22:20.233 --> 22:21.700
Can I get you
something, cop lover?

22:21.700 --> 22:24.767
No. Dad, does Aunt Ginger
live in Wisconsin?

22:24.767 --> 22:27.633
That's what I've
told you. Right?

22:27.633 --> 22:29.767
Then why was there a woman from
the Social Security Department

22:29.767 --> 22:33.200
at the house, saying that Ginger
cashes her checks in Chicago?

22:33.200 --> 22:36.700
Ginger's in town,
and she didn't call me?

22:36.700 --> 22:39.066
After all I've done
for that woman?

22:39.066 --> 22:41.500
Oh, shit, Frank.
You're cashing the checks.

22:41.500 --> 22:44.100
What?
Do you know how much trouble
you're going to be in?

22:44.100 --> 22:46.333
Why all this sudden
interest in Ginger, Fiona?

22:46.333 --> 22:48.133
Now that you know there's

22:48.133 --> 22:50.533
money involved, you're
looking for a little handout?

22:50.533 --> 22:52.533
Well, that money is mine.

22:52.533 --> 22:55.533
I'm the one who's taken care
of Ginger all these years,

22:55.533 --> 22:57.300
I call her every week.

22:57.300 --> 22:59.400
Hell, I've even visited her.

22:59.400 --> 23:01.066
Good.

23:01.066 --> 23:03.300
Then you can go get her
and bring her home with you.

23:03.300 --> 23:05.400
'cause that Social Security lady
will be here in the morning

23:05.400 --> 23:08.433
with a Federal agent,
to interview Ginger.

23:08.433 --> 23:10.300
Fine.

23:11.667 --> 23:15.033
(door opens and closes)

23:15.033 --> 23:20.000
Fuckity fuck fuck fuck....

23:39.133 --> 23:41.200
Plus, there's free appetizers,
and that means

23:41.200 --> 23:42.467
it's like all you can eat.

23:43.600 --> 23:46.433
Where do you think
you're going, Frank?

23:46.433 --> 23:48.166
Russell, my man.

23:48.166 --> 23:49.734
You know you're not
allowed in here anymore.

23:49.734 --> 23:51.066
Is the kitchen
closed already?

23:51.066 --> 23:53.200
I'm talking
about Christmas.

23:53.200 --> 23:55.300
(bell ringing)

24:03.567 --> 24:06.400
That was a total
misunderstanding.

24:06.400 --> 24:08.166
You're banned from
the mission, Frank.

24:10.367 --> 24:14.166
You, you know, the...
the Big Guy says

24:14.166 --> 24:16.166
thou shalt forgive me.

24:16.166 --> 24:18.233
Out.

24:19.166 --> 24:22.200
All right. Ah...

24:22.200 --> 24:24.500
I'm willing to put this
whole matter behind us,

24:24.500 --> 24:26.200
if you'd just let me borrow

24:26.200 --> 24:29.400
an old lady for a few hours.

24:30.600 --> 24:34.200
Wait, what... hold on.
Just a few hours!

24:34.200 --> 24:38.667
Just, can...
will you stop? Stop... Okay.

24:38.667 --> 24:41.400
I will be re-thinking my
charitable contributions

24:41.400 --> 24:43.000
to this organization

24:43.000 --> 24:45.100
come holiday time.

24:53.166 --> 24:54.433
MAN:
Hey, what the fuck?

24:54.433 --> 24:56.200
Shut the fuck up.

25:09.233 --> 25:12.233
Mandy! Mandy. Hey, hey.

25:12.233 --> 25:13.500
Get away from me, you perv!

25:13.500 --> 25:15.333
Why'd you tell your brothers
I attacked you?

25:15.333 --> 25:17.100
If you don't get away from me,
Ian Gallagher, I'll scream.

25:17.100 --> 25:18.567
Please, I'm
begging you.

25:18.567 --> 25:20.767
You have to tell them the truth.
They're going to kill me.

25:20.767 --> 25:23.100
Good!
Mandy!

25:24.700 --> 25:27.367
Yeah. Thank you.
Have a good day.

25:28.767 --> 25:32.166
I got you, sir.

25:32.166 --> 25:33.567
Uh, medium burger and fries.

25:33.567 --> 25:35.266
Next!

25:35.266 --> 25:37.100
I'll get the, uh, the
chicken burrito special.

25:37.100 --> 25:39.033
What are you
doing here?

25:39.033 --> 25:41.233
I'm sorry, I thought this was a
food truck, do I have it wrong?

25:41.233 --> 25:42.633
Are you stalking me?

25:42.633 --> 25:44.400
If wanting a burrito is
stalking you, I guess I am!

25:44.400 --> 25:46.633
Not interested.
Who's next?

25:46.633 --> 25:49.367
One mistake, and now you
want nothing to do with me.

25:49.367 --> 25:52.233
One mistake?
You kidnapped my father.

25:52.233 --> 25:54.333
I was trying to help.
Don't.

25:54.333 --> 25:56.400
All right, I've apologized.
isn't that enough?

25:56.400 --> 25:57.767
Leave me alone.

25:57.767 --> 26:01.533
Listen, you would not be so
pissed off if you didn't care.

26:01.533 --> 26:04.533
You know nothing about me.

26:04.533 --> 26:07.000
Then teach me!

26:09.000 --> 26:11.667
Teach me.

26:16.033 --> 26:18.300
Here's your burrito.
$6.50.

26:20.600 --> 26:23.467
Hey. Keep
the change.
No, thanks.

26:23.467 --> 26:25.600
Believe me, you need it
more than I do.

26:30.700 --> 26:32.567
An hour and 54 minutes.
Now that's a record.

26:32.567 --> 26:34.667
Yes. Now all we have
to do is figure out

26:34.667 --> 26:36.300
how I can go back
the same day,

26:36.300 --> 26:39.433
and take it again
for another kid.

26:39.433 --> 26:40.700
Uh-oh.

26:40.700 --> 26:42.166
Hey, yo!

26:42.166 --> 26:43.767
What do they want?

26:43.767 --> 26:45.734
Mickey probably just
wants to ask me out again.

26:45.734 --> 26:47.300
What, you're
not interested?

26:47.300 --> 26:49.100
If you like the
smell of cow shit.

26:49.100 --> 26:51.700
(giggles)

26:51.700 --> 26:54.200
Hey, got a B+ on that English
paper you wrote for me.

26:54.200 --> 26:56.533
Well, spread the word.
Could use the business.

26:56.533 --> 26:58.500
I heard they're letting
Iggy out of juvie.

26:58.500 --> 27:00.367
Yeah, yeah, Mom drove up
to go get him.

27:00.367 --> 27:02.300
Throwing a party for him
or some shit this weekend.

27:02.300 --> 27:04.100
Probably back in
before then, yeah?

27:04.100 --> 27:06.300
Ha ha, probably.

27:07.567 --> 27:10.133
So, Ian messed with Mandy.

27:10.133 --> 27:12.000
Ian?
Yeah.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.700
Well, that's, uh...
that's highly unlikely.

27:14.700 --> 27:16.367
That's what Mandy told us.

27:16.367 --> 27:18.200
Well, trust me,
you got the wrong guy.

27:18.200 --> 27:21.033
Right. The problem is that
Ian's been avoiding us all day,

27:21.033 --> 27:25.066
and, uh, someone's got to get
a beat-down till we find him.

27:27.200 --> 27:28.367
Could make
an exception.

27:28.367 --> 27:31.333
Not really, though.

27:35.467 --> 27:38.333
Well, maybe, uh,
Mandy's confusing Ian

27:38.333 --> 27:41.300
with any one of the other
400 dudes in the tenth grade

27:41.300 --> 27:43.633
she's already blown.

27:47.467 --> 27:50.533
(grunting and groaning)

27:54.166 --> 27:55.500
(door opening)

27:55.500 --> 27:58.300
Hey, hey, hey,
look who it is! Fiona.

27:58.300 --> 28:01.033
And Liam! Come say
hello to me, son.

28:01.033 --> 28:02.400
What are you doing here?

28:02.400 --> 28:04.367
I went to get Ginger,
like you told me to.

28:04.367 --> 28:06.166
(snoring)

28:06.166 --> 28:08.000
This is Aunt Ginger?

28:08.000 --> 28:10.166
In the flesh.

28:10.166 --> 28:12.233
Ginger has a hard-on.

28:12.233 --> 28:14.467
(knocking on door)

28:14.467 --> 28:17.200
She was born with
a large clitoris.

28:17.200 --> 28:19.100
(babbling)

28:19.100 --> 28:22.100
As kids, we were told to
keep our hugs brief.

28:22.100 --> 28:24.633
It's me, the virgin.

28:24.633 --> 28:27.633
Uh, not anymore. Remember
the car? Come on outside.

28:27.633 --> 28:30.533
Uh...

28:30.533 --> 28:33.600
You were right, I'm sorry.
I should've told you beforehand.

28:33.600 --> 28:35.200
A little heads-up
would have been nice.

28:35.200 --> 28:37.500
It's not the kind of thing
you run around telling everyone.

28:37.500 --> 28:39.667
Besides, I was afraid you
wouldn't do it if you knew.

28:39.667 --> 28:41.200
Probably wouldn't have.

28:41.200 --> 28:43.333
It's-It's a big thing.

28:43.333 --> 28:46.066
It's above average.

28:46.066 --> 28:48.133
I know it seems weird
I didn't have sex till now,

28:48.133 --> 28:50.433
but it's not from
a lack of trying.

28:50.433 --> 28:52.367
Joni always wanted to wait
till we got married,

28:52.367 --> 28:53.700
then she gave it up
to Dickie Dolan,

28:53.700 --> 28:56.133
night before he shipped out
for Fallujah, lost his leg.

28:56.133 --> 28:57.533
Uh, almost did it
with Houlie's sister

28:57.533 --> 28:59.266
Christmas Eve,
but she was too drunk.

28:59.266 --> 29:00.500
And Katie Jordan
was super Catholic,

29:00.500 --> 29:02.400
so she'd only let me
stick it in her b...

29:02.400 --> 29:04.400
Okay. Okay, okay, I get it.

29:04.400 --> 29:07.133
Hey, hey, uh... my mom
heard about us.

29:07.133 --> 29:08.533
What?

29:08.533 --> 29:10.533
You know how the women
in the neighborhood talk.

29:10.533 --> 29:14.033
She... invited you
to dinner. Tomorrow night.

29:14.033 --> 29:16.500
I find that hard to believe.

29:16.500 --> 29:20.033
Okay, maybe she's not that
enthusiastic about it,

29:20.033 --> 29:22.100
but I... I told her
you were coming.

29:22.100 --> 29:25.100
Let me think about it?

29:25.100 --> 29:28.100
Sure. Absolutely. Just, uh...

29:28.100 --> 29:29.600
just show up at 7:00?

29:29.600 --> 29:32.700
All right.

29:32.700 --> 29:36.166
You don't have to
run away from me, Fiona.

29:36.166 --> 29:38.166
I get you, I get your family.

29:38.166 --> 29:40.633
Come on, Miss Lisa married us

29:40.633 --> 29:43.000
at the Little Red Schoolhouse
when we were five.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.100
That's got to count
for something, right?

29:45.100 --> 29:46.367
Hey, Lip.

29:46.367 --> 29:48.433
There a body on
the other end of that?

29:48.433 --> 29:49.700
Nah, it's cool, Tone.

29:49.700 --> 29:51.700
Jesus, what the hell, Lip?

29:57.200 --> 29:59.133
Oh, for...

30:01.000 --> 30:05.600
Uh... I'll see you.

30:05.600 --> 30:08.734
The nose is the most
commonly broken bone

30:08.734 --> 30:11.133
in boys between
the ages of 13 and 25.

30:11.133 --> 30:12.433
Yeah, that's,
that's fascinating,

30:12.433 --> 30:13.567
but who's the old dude?

30:13.567 --> 30:14.567
It's not a dude.

30:14.567 --> 30:16.200
It's your Aunt Ginger.

30:16.200 --> 30:18.200
Oh, the one who
owns the house?

30:18.200 --> 30:20.333
That's right.
Ginger!

30:20.333 --> 30:22.233
Say hello to
your nephew!

30:22.233 --> 30:24.133
Dad, stop.

30:24.133 --> 30:26.467
Why-Why's he trying to pass off
Mr. Perry as Aunt Ginger?

30:26.467 --> 30:28.367
Who?

30:28.367 --> 30:29.767
Mr. Perry, my old bus driver.

30:29.767 --> 30:32.000
Now he sleeps by the Dumpster
over at the A&P.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.433
Social Security wants
to talk to Ginger,

30:33.433 --> 30:34.767
and he was too lazy

30:34.767 --> 30:36.400
to go get the real one.

30:36.400 --> 30:37.533
That's kind of
retardedly brilliant.

30:37.533 --> 30:40.100
Thank you.
Or brilliantly
retarded.

30:40.100 --> 30:41.567
Thank you.

30:41.567 --> 30:43.266
Now we have to drive
all night to go get her.

30:43.266 --> 30:45.033
Think Kev'll let us
borrow his car?

30:45.033 --> 30:47.100
No.

30:47.100 --> 30:48.767
I'll call and beg.

30:48.767 --> 30:51.667
We got these from Imelda
over at the Holiday Inn.

30:51.667 --> 30:53.400
It'll be a good
way to stay warm.

30:53.400 --> 30:57.367
Why's Mr. Perry here?

30:57.367 --> 30:58.567
FIONA:
Hey, Kev, it's me.

30:58.567 --> 31:01.533
Uh, can I borrow yr car just
for the night?

31:01.533 --> 31:04.100
I just need...
(mutters)

31:04.100 --> 31:05.567
You won't need the car.

31:05.567 --> 31:07.500
How are we gonna get Ginger?

31:07.500 --> 31:09.266
She's dead.

31:09.266 --> 31:10.100
What?

31:10.100 --> 31:11.300
DEBBIE:
Who's dead?

31:11.300 --> 31:13.066
LIP:
Aunt Ginger.

31:13.066 --> 31:14.567
No!

31:14.567 --> 31:16.400
LIP:
Debs, you never met her.

31:16.400 --> 31:18.066
And now I never will!

31:18.066 --> 31:21.300
Don't give me a hard time.
I've been very upset about this.

31:21.300 --> 31:23.567
I'm in mourning.

31:23.567 --> 31:25.533
When did she die?

31:27.400 --> 31:30.533
Mmm, 12 years ago.

Shit!

31:55.533 --> 31:57.400
How do you think I feel?

31:57.400 --> 32:00.700
That woman was
my heart and soul.

32:00.700 --> 32:03.433
She practically raised me.

32:03.433 --> 32:07.200
Dad, you've been cashing
her checks. That's a felony.

32:07.200 --> 32:09.567
We're living in her house.
Was there even a will?

32:09.567 --> 32:13.066
You don't need a will,
if she's not technically dead.

32:13.066 --> 32:17.333
Yes, she is
technically dead, Dad.

32:17.333 --> 32:19.033
Dead is dead.

32:19.033 --> 32:21.400
Just because you haven't told
anybody that she's dead,

32:21.400 --> 32:22.700
doesn't make her not dead.

32:23.533 --> 32:25.367
Fuck!

32:25.367 --> 32:27.233
What are we gonna do now?

32:27.233 --> 32:30.433
Well...

32:39.033 --> 32:41.200
Oh, Mrs. Sullivan is 92,

32:41.200 --> 32:42.767
but she's about to go
any minute.

32:42.767 --> 32:46.667
Helen-- she needs meds
every four hours,

32:46.667 --> 32:49.100
so she's a hassle.

32:54.166 --> 32:57.033
Beatrice-- her son visits daily.

32:57.033 --> 33:00.633
Jenny-- she's
a favorite around here.

33:00.633 --> 33:03.467
The others would notice
if she were missing.

33:03.467 --> 33:05.767
It's too bad.
She's hot.

33:09.734 --> 33:10.734
I like that one.

33:10.734 --> 33:11.700
Debbie!

33:11.700 --> 33:14.066
No, too lucid.

33:14.066 --> 33:15.767
You know how your friend

33:15.767 --> 33:19.000
Sophie's nana couldn't remember
anything 'cause she had

33:19.000 --> 33:20.233
old people's disease?
Alzheimer's?

33:20.233 --> 33:21.633
Yeah.

33:23.233 --> 33:25.500
Yeah, we're looking
for somebody like that.

33:29.100 --> 33:32.533
For the record, I do not want to
be sent to a place like this.

33:32.533 --> 33:34.533
Don't worry,
you'll outlive us all.

33:34.533 --> 33:37.066
You're not gonna get fired

33:37.066 --> 33:38.667
for letting us borrow
an old lady, right?

33:38.667 --> 33:41.066
Girl, please.
This place is just like

33:41.066 --> 33:42.233
what you see on the news.

33:42.233 --> 33:44.166
A month ago, one
of the night shift guys

33:44.166 --> 33:46.266
got caught fucking Mrs.
Hebert who's in a coma.

33:46.266 --> 33:48.200
He just got a raise.

33:48.200 --> 33:51.300
Maybe it's from

What about her?

33:51.300 --> 33:53.367
(mumbling)

33:53.367 --> 33:57.233
...but I want to learn...
How about au gratin?

33:57.233 --> 33:58.500
Yes.

34:00.633 --> 34:03.433
MICKEY:
Where's firecrotch?!

34:05.367 --> 34:07.000
Hey!

34:07.000 --> 34:09.400
Kash and Grab?

34:09.400 --> 34:11.767
He's only making
it worse.

34:11.767 --> 34:14.600
Okay, okay,

34:14.600 --> 34:17.000
we're gonna find him.

34:17.000 --> 34:21.700
Hey, Kash and Grab! Tomorrow,
when your shithole opens.

34:23.333 --> 34:25.000
They're leaving.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.066
IAN: This wouldn't be happening
if I had just had sex with her.

34:28.066 --> 34:29.567
You can't be
what you're not, Ian.

34:29.567 --> 34:31.300
Shut up. You  are.

34:31.300 --> 34:34.000
I didn't know what I was until
after I married Linda.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.233
Yeah, well, from now on I'm just
gonna be straight.

34:37.233 --> 34:39.333
It's not that easy.

34:39.333 --> 34:42.133
You do it.

34:42.133 --> 34:44.166
'Cause I love my kids. Don't
complicate things for yourself.

34:48.266 --> 34:51.166
Now get up here.
They're gone.
(engine starts)

35:05.000 --> 35:07.333

35:07.333 --> 35:09.433
Oh, my goodness.

35:09.433 --> 35:10.500
What's wrong?

35:10.500 --> 35:12.300
Nothing.

35:12.300 --> 35:15.700
Everything is just the way
I remember it.

35:15.700 --> 35:19.166
We kept the house
exactly the same,
Aunt Ginger.

35:19.166 --> 35:21.734
Oh, I can see that, dear.

35:21.734 --> 35:24.300
Oh, look,
there's the bookcase

35:24.300 --> 35:26.166
my brother Norman built.

35:26.166 --> 35:29.000
Do you want me to show you
to your room, Aunt Ginger?

35:29.000 --> 35:30.433
Oh, that would be
just wonderful.

35:30.433 --> 35:34.700
And after I wash up, why don't
I make us all some nice supper?

35:34.700 --> 35:36.367
Okay.

and one of the dancers
broke her foot.

37:18.700 --> 37:20.567
And before you know it,

37:20.567 --> 37:23.200
they're pulling me off

and they're teaching me

37:25.600 --> 37:29.567

that very night.

37:29.567 --> 37:34.166
Oh, from that point forward,
I was a regular dancer.

you see Ian in there?
Not home.

we're waiting for him.

38:42.133 --> 38:45.533
Sorry your face
got busted up.

38:45.533 --> 38:48.000
It's okay.

38:48.000 --> 38:51.333
I didn't do anything to Mandy.

38:51.333 --> 38:54.700
I know that, Ian, but her
brothers think you did.

38:54.700 --> 38:57.367
I mean, she tried

39:00.133 --> 39:03.233
Well, you're probably
the first guy in her life

39:03.233 --> 39:05.200
who hasn't tried
to jump her.

39:05.200 --> 39:08.400
She started screaming
and crying.

39:11.100 --> 39:14.633
Maybe you should
throw it in her,

39:14.633 --> 39:16.166
you know?

39:16.166 --> 39:19.066
She'll call her brothers off.

39:19.066 --> 39:24.066
Yeah, yeah, and maybe, uh, you
should throw it in Kash, right?

39:24.066 --> 39:26.300
Why, is he asking about me?

39:26.300 --> 39:29.567
Yeah, he's trying to go through
all the Gallagher brothers.

Ew.

45:06.233 --> 45:09.233
No. JC Chasez.

No, are you kidding?
He's totally gay.

45:11.433 --> 45:13.233
No, he isn't.

45:13.233 --> 45:15.000
Hello, yes, he is.

45:15.000 --> 45:16.066

45:27.233 --> 45:30.000

I won't tell anyone.

45:37.200 --> 45:39.400
Thanks.

45:39.400 --> 45:41.066
It's just that I thought

45:41.066 --> 45:43.400
maybe you were making this up
so I'd call my brothers off.

45:43.400 --> 45:47.433
Or, I don't know.

45:47.433 --> 45:52.133

46:21.000 --> 46:25.433
You can expect a visit
from me every six months.

46:25.433 --> 46:29.633
Yeah, 'cause this is such a
great use of government funds.

46:29.633 --> 46:33.166
Hey, maybe next time you can
check that my Uncle Harold

46:33.166 --> 46:34.300
is taking his Lipitor.

46:34.300 --> 46:35.767
Oh, wait, that's right.

46:35.767 --> 46:37.500
He doesn't get
Lipitor anymore,

46:37.500 --> 46:39.567
since you canceled
his Medicare.

46:39.567 --> 46:41.600

93-- she won't live long.

Huh!

Don't...!

penis I ever kissed.

47:24.467 --> 47:26.033

47:26.033 --> 47:27.767

to the nursing home.

47:27.767 --> 47:30.633

of a bus pass?

47:30.633 --> 47:34.166

47:34.166 --> 47:37.000

47:38.300 --> 47:39.433

to pee in the plant.

Please, she can't go back
to the nursing home.

47:44.500 --> 47:47.400
I'll take care of her.
I promise.

47:47.400 --> 47:49.734
She doesn't belong to us.

47:49.734 --> 47:52.233
Debs, you can come visit
anytime you want.

47:52.233 --> 47:54.633
Besides, you can borrow
her every six months.

47:54.633 --> 47:56.166

We should take Debs to visit
the real Ginger's grave.

48:10.400 --> 48:12.200
Where's she buried?
(door closes)

48:12.200 --> 48:15.266
Dad?
Huh?

48:16.533 --> 48:18.333
Um...

48:20.033 --> 48:21.266
Here.

48:21.266 --> 48:22.266
What?!

48:30.667 --> 48:32.700
I could pretend to be your
girlfriend at school and stuff.

48:32.700 --> 48:36.066
Then no one would ever
give you a hard time.

48:36.066 --> 48:37.734
You'd do that for me?

48:37.734 --> 48:40.633
Sure. It'd keep the creepy guys

48:40.633 --> 48:42.400
away from me.

48:42.400 --> 48:44.233
Besides...

48:44.233 --> 48:46.300
I've never actually

48:46.300 --> 48:48.500
had a real
boyfriend before.

48:48.500 --> 48:50.166
Well, not that you'd
be a real boyfriend.

48:50.166 --> 48:53.667
But a boyfriend
I could do things with,

48:53.667 --> 48:55.166
instead of...

48:55.166 --> 48:58.567
you know, just getting
finger-banged all the time.

48:58.567 --> 49:00.600
(laughing)

49:09.433 --> 49:12.166
What a pretty
little girl she is.

49:12.166 --> 49:15.033
Rice Krispie
Treats, anyone?
Debs, it's okay.

49:15.033 --> 49:17.000
I got you.
It's okay.
Rice Krispie Treats.

49:17.000 --> 49:19.467
I made them myself.
They're delicious.

49:19.467 --> 49:21.266
I really worked very hard.

49:21.266 --> 49:24.266
I'd appreciate it
if you would take one.

49:24.266 --> 49:27.400
I know.
So sorry. Oh, you
ladies are so busy,

49:27.400 --> 49:29.300
you might get
sticky fingers.

49:29.300 --> 49:30.667
He's pretty
busy, too.

49:30.667 --> 49:34.133
(sobbing)
It's okay. I know.

49:34.133 --> 49:35.400
It's okay.
Somebody wants
my Rice Krispies.

49:35.400 --> 49:38.333
Oh, ladies.
Oh, you're
so talented.

49:38.333 --> 49:41.133
I wish I could do...
But I'm a very busy...

49:41.133 --> 49:43.667
You go ahead...

49:43.667 --> 49:45.533
Everyone has to
take one...

49:45.533 --> 49:47.533
And would you
like one, sir?

49:47.533 --> 49:49.734
It's okay.
Let's go home.
He looks pretty busy.

49:49.734 --> 49:51.600
She's okay now.
Everyone's so busy.

49:51.600 --> 49:55.333
Ladies...

49:55.333 --> 49:58.667
Well, we came for a visit.
She wasn't in her room.

49:58.667 --> 50:02.100
None of the staff
knew where she was.

50:02.100 --> 50:07.033
WOMAN:
After we called the police to
file a missing persons report,

50:07.033 --> 50:08.400
she just walked through
the front door

50:08.400 --> 50:11.400
as if nothing had happened.

50:11.400 --> 50:13.233
She keeps calling herself Abby,

50:13.233 --> 50:14.767
and she says that she'd like

50:14.767 --> 50:18.133
to ask us a few questions.

50:18.133 --> 50:21.133
AUNT GINGER:
Oh, you ladies are so busy...

50:21.133 --> 50:24.500
It's so scary
out there, Frank.

50:24.500 --> 50:28.100
(indistinct voices over TV)

50:32.600 --> 50:34.233
(sniffles)

50:46.333 --> 50:48.400
(knocking)

50:48.400 --> 50:49.500
Hey.

50:49.500 --> 50:51.400
Above the covers.

50:51.400 --> 50:54.433
You got it.

50:54.433 --> 50:57.166
You look nice.
