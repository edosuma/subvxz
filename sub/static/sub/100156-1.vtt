[Hiccup]
<i>This is New Berk at Snoggletog,</i>

00:08.733 --> 00:10.732
<i>the greatest time of the year.</i>

00:10.734 --> 00:13.735
- <i>The lights, the hunting songs...</i>
- [vocalizing]

00:13.737 --> 00:15.469
<i>...the holiday shopping...</i>

00:15.471 --> 00:16.704
- [man] Oh.
- [woman] Uh-huh.

00:16.706 --> 00:19.707
- Cheers!
- <i>...the Yak-nog shooters.</i>

00:19.709 --> 00:21.307
- 'Nother round!
- Make mine a double!

00:21.309 --> 00:23.711
<i>The only thing missing...
was dragons.</i>

00:23.713 --> 00:25.779
[whimpers]

00:25.781 --> 00:29.549
<i>It's been ten years since Vikings
and dragons agreed to live apart.</i>

00:29.551 --> 00:33.285
<i>But that doesn't mean we've
forgotten our flying friends.</i>

00:33.287 --> 00:35.487
And the best part
of it all, Nuffink,

00:35.489 --> 00:37.388
- was on Snoggletog Eve...
- [Nuffink] Yeah?

00:37.390 --> 00:40.025
- ...I'd make Toothless his favorite meal.
- What was it?

00:40.027 --> 00:42.593
- Lake trout with a side of sea trout...
- Yeah. Yeah.

00:42.595 --> 00:45.863
- ...on a bed of brook trout.
- We all like trout.

00:45.865 --> 00:49.366
And even though he's gone,
I still make it for him.

00:49.368 --> 00:51.501
A lot of families
do stuff like this.

00:51.503 --> 00:54.338
It keeps our loved ones in our
hearts, even though they're far away.

00:56.340 --> 00:58.841
- So, want to help me catch some fish?
- Good on ya!

00:58.843 --> 01:00.642
We're gonna
feed Toothless!

01:00.644 --> 01:02.377
I don't need
a fishing pole, Dad!

01:02.379 --> 01:04.479
I'll just butt the wee
fishes with me own wee head!

01:04.480 --> 01:06.481
- Ow!
- [sighs]

01:06.483 --> 01:08.783
- Ow! Ow!
- [Hiccup] Come on, Nuffink. Let's get Toothless a snack.

01:08.785 --> 01:10.684
[laughs]

01:10.686 --> 01:14.487
[Hiccup] <i>We were excited about
making a traditional dragon feast.</i>

01:14.489 --> 01:15.825
<i>And then it hit me.</i>
[grunts]

01:19.627 --> 01:21.661
<i>Not everyone was on board.</i>

01:21.663 --> 01:23.528
[giggles]
Yes! It worked!

01:23.530 --> 01:25.497
Zephyr,
what are you doing?

01:25.499 --> 01:28.500
Testing my dragon
defense system.

01:28.502 --> 01:31.635
You and all the grown-ups in New
Berk are leaving them snacks.

01:31.637 --> 01:34.839
- What if one shows up?
- That would be great. We love dragons.

01:34.841 --> 01:36.907
Why?
They're monsters.

01:36.909 --> 01:42.414
[voices screaming]

01:43.081 --> 01:44.480
- Oh.
- Uh...

01:44.482 --> 01:46.782
I found this in the attic.
It was Grandpa's.

01:46.784 --> 01:49.518
How come you never told us
the truth about dragons?

01:49.520 --> 01:51.653
But we did.
Dragons are wonderful.

01:51.655 --> 01:52.755
They're our friends.

01:52.757 --> 01:55.356
Tell me this.
Are they giant?

01:55.358 --> 01:57.558
- Well, yeah.
- Razor-sharp teeth?

01:57.560 --> 01:59.392
- Breathe fire?
- I suppose so.

01:59.394 --> 02:00.560
- Claws?
- That'd be yes.

02:00.562 --> 02:03.663
- What happened to your leg?
- Oh. Oh. Uh...

02:03.665 --> 02:05.364
That's what I thought.

02:05.366 --> 02:08.101
Maybe we don't leave fish snacks
around to attract them.

02:08.103 --> 02:10.803
'Cause you know who doesn't
want to be dragon dessert?

02:10.805 --> 02:12.505
Me!

02:12.507 --> 02:15.774
Nuffink, do you want to be
dessert for a dragon?

02:15.776 --> 02:18.343
Hmm.
Methinks I don't.

02:18.345 --> 02:20.447
Let's kill
the dragons!

02:20.881 --> 02:23.413
How did this
happen?

02:23.415 --> 02:27.417
Our ancestors were terrified of
dragons because they didn't know them.

02:27.419 --> 02:30.419
Astrid, we cannot let our
kids go down that road.

02:30.421 --> 02:33.856
Hmm. Remember when we were
kids back in Old Berk,

02:33.858 --> 02:36.358
- how we used to put on a pageant at Snoggletog?
- [grunting]

02:36.360 --> 02:37.860
Oh, yeah.
Those were fun.

02:37.862 --> 02:40.428
What if we brought
the pageant back?

02:40.430 --> 02:44.132
We showed the children of New Berk
how humans and dragons became friends?

02:44.134 --> 02:45.800
- [Nuffink] Bigger!
- That's a great idea.

02:45.802 --> 02:48.569
But we've only got
four days until Snoggletog.

02:48.571 --> 02:50.805
Three if you don't count
Black Plague Friday.

02:50.807 --> 02:52.840
Yeah,
nothing gets done.

02:52.842 --> 02:54.941
Everybody's just
shopping and coughing.

02:54.943 --> 02:56.576
- [Zephyr] More spikes.
- [pounding]

02:56.578 --> 02:59.547
I think we can do this.
Let's talk to Gobber.

02:59.915 --> 03:01.613
[growls]

03:01.615 --> 03:03.484
- [grunts]
- [giggles]

03:04.518 --> 03:05.717
You got me!

03:05.719 --> 03:07.587
Kid can take a hit.

03:08.555 --> 03:09.720
[sighs]

03:09.722 --> 03:12.824
- Hey. Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

03:12.826 --> 03:17.561
It's just, all this talk of
dragons kind of makes me miss him.

03:17.563 --> 03:19.598
It's hard at the
holidays, you know.

03:20.833 --> 03:23.334
Wonder if Toothless
ever misses me.

[both shrieking]

04:40.034 --> 04:41.836
- [Toothless roars]
- [coos]

04:45.639 --> 04:47.672
- [boy grunts]
- Hit his nose.

04:47.674 --> 04:48.708
[Zephyr grunts]

04:49.709 --> 04:51.677
Yeah!
That's two for me.

04:52.511 --> 04:54.544
Oh!
Curse ye, hellions!

04:54.546 --> 04:58.416
How dare ye desecrate the
statue of Stoick the Vast?

04:59.484 --> 05:01.084
- Who?
- Stoick!

05:01.086 --> 05:03.686
The bravest Viking
in the history of Berk!

05:03.688 --> 05:05.922
He put the "king"
in Viking.

05:05.924 --> 05:07.023
[all] Huh?

05:07.025 --> 05:10.825
Oh, my dear mate,
I miss you so.

05:10.827 --> 05:13.028
Remember the time we
were at that mead-house

05:13.030 --> 05:16.931
and those two Visigoths wagered
I couldn't hold my left elbow

05:16.933 --> 05:19.800
in a boiling pot of
gruel for five minutes?

05:19.802 --> 05:22.568
[laughs]
Good times.

05:22.570 --> 05:24.938
- [clears throat] Gobber.
- Hey, kids.

05:24.940 --> 05:27.709
I was just talking to a statue of
your father as if he were really here.

05:29.677 --> 05:33.912
It pains me how the wee ones of
this town have forgotten Stoick.

05:33.914 --> 05:37.015
I know,
and Zephyr is afraid of dragons.

05:37.017 --> 05:40.051
That's why we want to bring
back the Snoggletog pageant.

05:40.053 --> 05:41.819
- [blows]
- [coughs]

05:41.821 --> 05:45.755
You're in luck.
The script I wrote for the last pageant.

05:45.757 --> 05:49.893
Die, you evil beasts
with twisted souls!

05:49.895 --> 05:53.829
Vikings will forever swim
in rivers of your blood!

05:53.831 --> 05:55.998
[groans]
That's nasty.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.733
This has not
aged well.

05:57.735 --> 06:01.035
Mmm. We may need
to start from scratch.

06:01.037 --> 06:03.004
Why don't we show
when everything changed?

06:03.006 --> 06:04.706
Oh, that would be
fantastic!

06:04.708 --> 06:06.007
Like when I met
Toothless and...

06:06.009 --> 06:08.608
Maybe more
big picture, honey.

06:08.610 --> 06:11.011
When all Vikings and
dragons became friends.

06:11.013 --> 06:14.081
Oh, Astrid, I love that.
I'll start writing immediately.

06:14.083 --> 06:15.881
This is gonna be
just what we need...

06:15.883 --> 06:18.619
to honor our friendship
with dragons and, of course,

06:19.619 --> 06:22.522
my great friend,
Stoick.

06:22.923 --> 06:25.460
Okay.

06:34.632 --> 06:35.800
[chitters]

06:38.337 --> 06:39.704
[snores]

06:43.640 --> 06:44.641
[chitters]

06:49.980 --> 06:53.850
[all chittering]

06:56.085 --> 06:57.053
- [squeals]
- [chitters]

07:06.727 --> 07:08.961
Hiccup,
I've been up all night.

07:08.963 --> 07:11.662
It's just a first draft,
but I'm gonna be honest...

07:11.664 --> 07:13.098
it's brilliant!

07:13.100 --> 07:14.801
Oh! Toothless?

07:17.003 --> 07:18.803
Pretty great,
right?

07:18.805 --> 07:20.637
Amazing!

07:20.639 --> 07:22.672
Wait a minute,
I've got an idea.

07:22.674 --> 07:24.841
We should use this
for the pageant.

07:24.843 --> 07:27.210
Well, yeah,
that's, that's...

07:27.212 --> 07:29.079
Gee, I never would've
thought of that.

07:29.081 --> 07:31.981
I'm gonna make him look
so much like Toothless,

07:31.983 --> 07:34.116
Zephyr's gonna fall
in love with him.

07:34.118 --> 07:37.052
He's beautiful.

07:37.054 --> 07:40.822
But cogs and gears can't bring back
the warmth of your friend's nose

07:40.824 --> 07:43.124
or the light
in his eyes.

07:43.126 --> 07:45.661
Or the sound of your
best friend's voice.

07:46.228 --> 07:47.863
Yeah, I miss my dad,
too, Gobber.

07:48.964 --> 07:51.566
Ah, we'll make them
both proud.

07:53.735 --> 07:55.935
[Hiccup] <i>It was a couple
of days before Snoggletog,</i>

07:55.937 --> 07:57.939
<i>and I was getting excited
about the pageant.</i>

07:59.140 --> 08:00.872
Ah. Uh-uh.

08:00.874 --> 08:02.040
<i>And then it hit me.</i>

08:02.042 --> 08:03.674
[screams, grunts]

08:03.676 --> 08:04.710
- [apparatus clanking]
- [gasps]

08:06.846 --> 08:09.980
- Yes! It works!
- We're going to catch a dragon, Dad!

08:09.982 --> 08:11.882
Knock him cold
so he can't eat us!

08:11.884 --> 08:13.917
Zephyr designed
the whole trap herself.

08:13.919 --> 08:15.852
[Hiccup] Ah, so proud.
[chuckles]

08:15.854 --> 08:18.121
Come on, Nuffink.
Let's set some traps outside.

08:18.123 --> 08:20.156
- Come on!
- We're going to kill a dragon!

08:20.158 --> 08:23.125
- [Astrid] What did I say about using the good knives?
- [Hiccup] A little help here?

08:23.127 --> 08:24.793
- [Astrid] Kids!
- Has anybody...

08:24.795 --> 08:27.131
Okay. This pageant
better work.

08:37.072 --> 08:38.173
[snores]

08:45.680 --> 08:48.648
- [yelps]
- [growling]

08:52.752 --> 08:54.087
[both chattering]

08:55.822 --> 08:57.021
[man] Coming through.

08:57.023 --> 08:58.289
Great news, chief.

08:58.291 --> 09:01.191
After exhaustive casting,
we've found our Hiccup.

09:01.193 --> 09:04.161
Yeah, Gobber,
actually I wanted to ask you

09:04.163 --> 09:06.729
about the whole Hiccup
character in the story.

09:06.731 --> 09:08.166
Hiccup,
present yourself!

09:10.201 --> 09:13.001
- Tuffnut?
- Tuffnut, give us a taste.

09:13.003 --> 09:15.237
Uh, a dragon is coming.

09:15.239 --> 09:18.106
Aah. Help me. Help...

09:18.108 --> 09:20.077
Uh... uh, line?

09:20.843 --> 09:21.976
Me?

09:21.978 --> 09:24.044
- Right. Me.
- [Hiccup] Are you...

09:24.046 --> 09:27.047
Great. Now let's see you
run away in fear.

09:27.049 --> 09:29.916
- [shouting]
- Oh, look at those knock-knees,

09:29.918 --> 09:32.285
- the splayed gait of a newborn lamb.
- [Hiccup] I don't...

09:32.287 --> 09:34.753
I do not run
like that.

09:34.755 --> 09:36.088
- Do I run like that?
- Mmm.

09:36.090 --> 09:38.290
Which brings me
to a bigger point.

09:38.292 --> 09:41.927
I read the script, Gobber,
and I have some notes.

09:41.929 --> 09:45.096
I'm not sure the character
of Hiccup is coming through

09:45.098 --> 09:46.964
quite as heroic
as I was.

09:46.966 --> 09:49.033
I was pretty heroic.
No?

09:49.035 --> 09:51.335
Oh, mate, I think
we got the gist of it.

09:51.337 --> 09:53.303
But that's not,
in any way, me.

09:53.305 --> 09:55.205
Hey, Hiccup.
I was...

09:55.207 --> 09:56.839
Oh.

09:56.841 --> 09:58.040
- Are you serious?
- [chuckling]

09:58.042 --> 09:59.010
[man]
Coming through!

10:02.079 --> 10:03.147
- [sighs]
- [shrieks]

10:04.948 --> 10:06.750
[all chittering]

10:08.885 --> 10:11.852
[chittering continues]

10:11.854 --> 10:14.154
[Gobber] Better luck next time, Haggis.
Nice effort.

10:14.156 --> 10:15.956
- Who's next?
- I... [sighs]

10:15.958 --> 10:20.129
Fishlegs Ingerman reading for
the role of Stoick the Vast.

10:21.863 --> 10:23.097
[exhales]

10:24.098 --> 10:25.264
If I don't return...

10:25.266 --> 10:29.236
Nope. No.
[clearing throat]

10:30.103 --> 10:32.037
[deep voice]
If I don't return,

10:32.039 --> 10:34.707
know that all I am,
all I do,

10:35.242 --> 10:38.175
is for you,
my precious Hiccup.

10:38.177 --> 10:40.110
[gasps] Wow.

10:40.112 --> 10:42.979
So, are you thinking
what I'm thinkin'?

10:42.981 --> 10:45.949
Yes, I am.
This isn't working.

10:45.951 --> 10:47.217
What?
Not working?

10:47.219 --> 10:49.552
You're right.
I should do it.

10:49.554 --> 10:51.220
No, don't try
and talk me out of it.

10:51.222 --> 10:53.123
- I knew Stoick best.
- [whimpers]

10:54.058 --> 10:55.025
[clears throat]

10:55.893 --> 10:58.027
If I don't return,

10:58.562 --> 11:00.995
know that all I am,

11:00.997 --> 11:02.330
all I do...

11:02.332 --> 11:05.999
[sobbing]
I miss him so much!

11:06.001 --> 11:07.100
[sighs]

11:07.102 --> 11:08.134
I just need
a moment.

11:08.136 --> 11:09.905
Da-da-da,
we're doomed.

11:16.310 --> 11:17.309
- [shouts]
- [laughs]

11:17.311 --> 11:18.279
[hisses]

11:19.879 --> 11:22.115
[Gobber sobbing]

11:25.018 --> 11:26.019
[coos]

11:27.153 --> 11:29.186
[sobbing]

11:29.188 --> 11:33.156
Gobber, the pageant's tonight. So, are
you sure you're gonna be able to do this?

11:33.158 --> 11:35.259
I hoped it wasn't
noticeable.

11:35.261 --> 11:36.426
You know, it is.

11:36.428 --> 11:39.161
But, Gobber,
think of the kids.

11:39.163 --> 11:40.429
- We're doing this for them.
- [grunting]

11:40.431 --> 11:42.097
Ay, Hiccup.

11:42.099 --> 11:43.967
Brilliant, as always.

11:47.604 --> 11:49.970
- [squeals]
- [barks]

11:49.972 --> 11:51.606
[Gobber] All right.
I'm all right. I'm okay.

11:51.608 --> 11:53.376
- It's gonna be fine.
- [Gobber] Fine.

11:55.278 --> 11:56.212
[chitters]

11:59.281 --> 12:01.414
[all growling]

12:01.416 --> 12:02.783
What?

12:04.985 --> 12:07.187
[Gobber] Okay, people,
two minutes to curtain.

12:08.422 --> 12:09.621
[man]
Has anyone seen my sword?

12:09.623 --> 12:12.925
[all shriek]

12:14.260 --> 12:15.326
[bleats]

12:15.328 --> 12:17.063
[groans]

12:17.964 --> 12:20.198
[whimpering]

12:29.173 --> 12:30.174
[branch snaps]

12:33.644 --> 12:34.944
[grunts]
Ah?

12:35.479 --> 12:36.413
[growls]

12:38.948 --> 12:40.849
[roars]

12:41.351 --> 12:42.417
[all whimper]

12:42.419 --> 12:44.451
[roaring]

12:44.453 --> 12:46.322
[horn plays]

12:48.923 --> 12:49.857
[chuckles]

12:56.664 --> 12:58.332
[audience applauding]

13:01.335 --> 13:05.670
Hiccup, today is the
day everything changes.

13:05.672 --> 13:08.841
- I have tamed a dragon.
- [audience oohs]

13:10.209 --> 13:12.942
I am so tiny and afraid.

13:12.944 --> 13:15.345
What is that? What is that?
That never happened.

13:15.347 --> 13:17.447
So Gobber took
a few liberties.

13:17.449 --> 13:20.115
I don't know.
There were dragons everywhere,

13:20.117 --> 13:23.985
and people doubting me,
especially my own father.

13:23.987 --> 13:26.120
And then I stood my
ground and touched one.

13:26.122 --> 13:28.289
I touched a dragon.
That's hard-core.

13:28.291 --> 13:30.191
He's got the spirit
of the story.

13:30.193 --> 13:32.460
And that's what this pageant
is really about, isn't it?

13:32.462 --> 13:34.228
Yeah, I guess so.

13:34.230 --> 13:38.398
- Hiccup, you are weak and fear dragons.
- [audience laughs]

13:38.400 --> 13:42.201
I am strong
and understand them.

13:42.203 --> 13:44.136
I don't know if I want
to go through with this.

13:44.138 --> 13:45.139
- You're on!
- Yeah, I...

13:46.040 --> 13:48.275
No. Astrid? I... What?

13:50.444 --> 13:52.011
[audience oohs]

13:56.148 --> 13:57.348
[boy] A dragon!

13:57.350 --> 14:00.317
There he is.
The Night Fury.

14:00.319 --> 14:01.985
[groans]

14:01.987 --> 14:03.155
- [boy] It's Toothless!
- [girl] Toothless.

14:07.458 --> 14:08.557
[audience oohs]

14:08.559 --> 14:10.126
- Whoa!
- Nope.

14:10.128 --> 14:11.295
Mmm. Whatever.

14:13.430 --> 14:15.196
[audience exclaims]

14:15.198 --> 14:17.532
[coos]

14:17.534 --> 14:21.101
This pageant is bringing
up the feelings.

14:21.103 --> 14:23.003
Stoick would've
loved this.

14:23.005 --> 14:26.340
The only thing vaster
than his presence

14:26.342 --> 14:29.475
was his capacity
for mirth!

14:29.477 --> 14:33.046
[blows nose, wails]

14:35.249 --> 14:37.317
Oh, pookie lump.

14:47.760 --> 14:51.528
- Brave father, I remember your wise words.
- [both gasp]

14:51.530 --> 14:54.097
"Hiccup,
you can be a giant,

14:54.099 --> 14:57.166
but face thine enemies
with care."

14:57.168 --> 14:59.568
[yelps] Oh, no.

14:59.570 --> 15:03.307
"Hiccup, you can be
a giant, but face..."

15:04.508 --> 15:07.341
No. Line?

15:07.343 --> 15:09.076
[shouting]

15:09.078 --> 15:10.445
[both scream]

15:10.447 --> 15:12.212
[all exclaim]

15:12.214 --> 15:15.182
"Hiccup, you can be
a giant but face!"

15:15.184 --> 15:17.186
Don't panic.
It's just part of the show.

15:19.120 --> 15:21.222
[shouting]

15:22.023 --> 15:23.957
[screams]

15:25.426 --> 15:28.426
[all screaming]

15:28.428 --> 15:30.130
[grunts]

15:32.332 --> 15:33.500
[all cooing]

15:35.134 --> 15:37.203
[shouts]
Oh! Hey, you...

15:39.505 --> 15:40.604
[screams]

15:40.606 --> 15:42.106
[whimpers]

15:43.408 --> 15:45.074
Do something!

15:45.076 --> 15:47.110
Yeah, I got it.
Maybe this one.

15:50.180 --> 15:53.181
Why would you give it
that functionality?

15:53.183 --> 15:54.316
[screams]

15:54.318 --> 15:55.252
[screams]

15:56.587 --> 15:57.987
I'm on it.

16:01.324 --> 16:02.456
Yeah, I got it.

16:02.458 --> 16:03.593
[roars]

16:07.062 --> 16:11.098
No, no, no, no, no.
[screams]

16:21.341 --> 16:23.107
Gobber? Gobber?

16:23.109 --> 16:24.475
Is that you?

16:24.477 --> 16:26.109
- Thank you for helping out there.
- [sniffs]

16:26.111 --> 16:27.511
[chitters]

16:27.513 --> 16:30.447
[groans] What did you
have, raw trout for lunch?

16:30.449 --> 16:34.151
Let me just shift my weight so I can...
[shouts]

16:34.485 --> 16:36.285
Uh, Gobber?

16:36.287 --> 16:38.854
How did you lose your last two
limbs, Gobber?

16:38.856 --> 16:40.422
Oh, it was a pageant.

16:40.424 --> 16:42.225
- [Hiccup] Gobber?
- Huh?

16:43.293 --> 16:44.294
Hiccup!

16:45.462 --> 16:47.062
[chitters]

16:49.431 --> 16:51.433
[audience exclaims]

16:59.274 --> 17:00.439
[all chittering]

17:00.441 --> 17:03.241
Whoa!
Nice one, Hiccup.

17:03.243 --> 17:07.512
Greetings,
magnificent creature!

17:07.513 --> 17:12.653
Will you allow Stoick to tame
you with his gentle... touch?

17:16.321 --> 17:17.390
[chitters]

17:19.457 --> 17:20.392
[chitters]

17:27.498 --> 17:29.197
[audience] Aww!

17:29.199 --> 17:31.166
[cheering]

17:31.168 --> 17:35.603
Let man and dragon
be forever bonded

17:35.605 --> 17:38.141
in trust and love.

17:39.375 --> 17:41.209
[giggles]

17:42.611 --> 17:43.612
Yes!

17:49.450 --> 17:51.216
[chitters]

17:51.218 --> 17:54.720
Oh, thank you. Thank you,
thank you. Thank you very much.

17:54.722 --> 17:57.355
Whoa!
That was amazing!

17:57.357 --> 18:00.358
I'm so excited
I could fly!

18:00.360 --> 18:03.327
It's just a show, Nuffink.
It's just Dad in a suit.

18:03.329 --> 18:04.428
Best show yet!

18:04.430 --> 18:06.663
[Nuffink] Way to go, Dad!
[whoops]

18:06.665 --> 18:08.765
Hey, Dad. Dad?

18:08.767 --> 18:09.702
- [growls]
- [gasps]

18:17.775 --> 18:19.176
[gasps]

18:22.512 --> 18:23.614
Hi.

18:25.314 --> 18:26.513
[sniffs]

18:26.515 --> 18:28.749
Little help here?
Gobber?

18:28.751 --> 18:32.387
- [chitters]
- Anyone? Literally anybody?

18:33.689 --> 18:35.256
[purrs]

18:47.668 --> 18:49.669
Oh! [giggles]

18:53.306 --> 18:56.406
I love dragons,
and I love Toothless!

18:56.408 --> 18:58.775
He's beautiful!

18:58.777 --> 19:02.411
Why didn't you tell me you were
really going to bring him here?

19:02.413 --> 19:05.347
I have literally no idea
what she's talking about.

19:05.349 --> 19:07.716
This whole thing was
not what I expected.

19:07.718 --> 19:09.652
[boy] Okay.
How about now?

19:09.654 --> 19:12.422
Up a little.
A bit to the right.

19:14.424 --> 19:19.994
- I am Stoick the Vast!
- I'm Toothless! Let's be friends. [giggles]

19:19.996 --> 19:22.429
[sighs]
You were right.

19:22.431 --> 19:24.698
It was exactly
what everyone needed.

19:24.700 --> 19:27.633
For the kids,
and for the memory of my father.

19:27.635 --> 19:29.337
[clicks tongue]
Aww.

19:31.506 --> 19:35.840
Gobber, you have well honored
my father and your friend.

19:35.842 --> 19:39.477
It was my deepest
privilege to do so.

19:39.479 --> 19:40.614
Thank you,
Hiccup.

19:43.249 --> 19:46.184
Well, guess I'll be
headin' home.

19:46.419 --> 19:47.718
Alone.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.752
Oh, the best Snoggletogs

19:49.754 --> 19:54.289
are spent in solitary,
cavernous silence.

19:54.291 --> 19:55.457
- Gobber.
- If you're free tonight...

19:55.459 --> 19:56.727
- I'd love to!
- [Astrid laughs]

19:57.628 --> 19:58.696
Gobber, wait!

20:02.532 --> 20:04.734
- [chuckles] Oh, that's clever.
- And...

20:06.636 --> 20:08.369
You're good.

20:08.371 --> 20:10.305
[sighs] So proud.

20:11.606 --> 20:15.575
- [gasps]
- Look at that. It's so cool!

20:15.577 --> 20:17.276
It's beautiful.

20:17.278 --> 20:20.279
- Hiccup, did you do this?
- No.

20:20.281 --> 20:22.715
The bowl!
It's empty!

20:22.717 --> 20:24.752
- Toothless?
- Can it be?

20:26.854 --> 20:27.787
[gasps]

20:31.356 --> 20:32.391
[roars]

20:32.826 --> 20:34.226
Toothless!

20:34.626 --> 20:35.761
Yeah!

20:38.329 --> 20:40.529
- [Hiccup] <i>And then it hit me...</i>
- [shouts]

20:40.531 --> 20:42.832
<i>...our loved ones
are always nearby</i>

20:42.834 --> 20:44.667
<i>when we hold them in our hearts.</i>

20:44.669 --> 20:46.802
Maybe it's our turn
to visit them.

20:46.804 --> 20:48.338
[all shrieking]

20:57.346 --> 20:58.314
Hey!

21:07.355 --> 21:08.423
[chitters]
