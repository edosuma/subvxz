00:01.916 --> 00:03.778
- Chapter 19.

00:03.878 --> 00:06.740
With Marina back working
long days at her law office

00:06.840 --> 00:09.262
and Tom writing his novel
late into the night

00:09.362 --> 00:11.264
all while raising three kids,

00:11.364 --> 00:13.946
they were both
running on fumes.

00:14.046 --> 00:16.668
Fortunately, Marina's father,
Roberto, had just arrived

00:16.768 --> 00:19.671
last night from San Diego
to help out.

00:19.771 --> 00:21.432
Hey, Papi.

00:21.532 --> 00:22.833
- Morning, Papi.

00:22.933 --> 00:24.154
- You're up early.

00:24.254 --> 00:25.636
- I fixed your porch light
for you.

00:25.736 --> 00:28.118
- Oh, I didn't know
it was broken.

00:28.218 --> 00:29.479
- Well, it isn't anymore.

00:29.579 --> 00:30.800
- [clears throat] Right.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.841
- You know, Tom could do that.

00:32.941 --> 00:34.803
- Yeah, I put together
this table right here.

00:34.903 --> 00:36.444
- Oh.
[table creaking]

00:36.544 --> 00:38.286
- Oh, that kind of--

00:38.386 --> 00:40.087
it's actually--
it's never done that before.

00:40.187 --> 00:42.009
- Thank you so much
for helping out.

00:42.109 --> 00:44.691
The twins, they usually go down
for their first nap at 10:00,

00:44.791 --> 00:47.193
but Alejandro,
he needs to be rocked to sleep.

00:48.474 --> 00:51.416
You know what?
Just keep them alive.

00:51.516 --> 00:53.518
- You need any money?

00:54.519 --> 00:55.860
- No, thank you. I'm fine.

00:55.960 --> 00:57.962
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:58.642 --> 01:01.465
- Well, that was
some quality Roberto time.

01:01.565 --> 01:03.426
- Yeah, that might be
the longest conversation

01:03.525 --> 01:05.348
we've had in ten years.
- That's kind of sad.

01:05.448 --> 01:07.550
- Look, I know
he's not exactly warm

01:07.650 --> 01:09.391
or good with kids.

01:09.491 --> 01:10.372
The only game
he would play with me

01:10.452 --> 01:13.354
when I was little
was called "Shh."

01:13.454 --> 01:15.396
I always won.

01:15.496 --> 01:17.197
- That's actually
kind of smart.

01:17.297 --> 01:19.439
- Look, it's just
for a week, okay?

01:19.539 --> 01:22.482
Now that he is retired
and with Mom gone,

01:22.582 --> 01:25.764
wow, five years now,
he needs to keep busy.

01:25.864 --> 01:27.085
- In terms of that week,

01:27.185 --> 01:28.567
is that seven days
starting today,

01:28.667 --> 01:30.048
or is it, like,
technically last night?

01:30.148 --> 01:32.149
- Bye.
- Okay.

01:33.470 --> 01:34.892
Oh, hey.

01:34.991 --> 01:37.774
- Can you slip this
into Marina's purse?

01:37.874 --> 01:39.776
You look like you
hold her purse a lot.

01:39.876 --> 01:43.598
- What? Come on.
I'm not a purse-holding guy.

01:44.680 --> 01:45.821
- I would give anything

01:45.920 --> 01:48.223
to be able to hold
my wife's purse again.

01:48.323 --> 01:51.325
- Right, that's--yes. Hmm.

01:53.366 --> 01:55.068
Do you know how many this is?

01:55.168 --> 01:56.789
It's seven.

01:56.889 --> 01:58.390
Seven more days.

02:04.736 --> 02:06.357
[laughter]

02:06.457 --> 02:08.679
- So, Roberto,
how's retirement?

02:08.779 --> 02:10.781
- It's good.

02:12.542 --> 02:14.644
- How is San Diego?

02:14.744 --> 02:16.746
- Fine.

02:17.146 --> 02:18.927
- This is a good time.

02:19.027 --> 02:20.889
We're all having fun.

02:20.989 --> 02:22.290
Funny story.

02:22.390 --> 02:25.212
I'm actually dating
Denise's sister, JoJo.

02:25.312 --> 02:27.454
Yeah, she's kind of, like,
a social media influencer.

02:27.554 --> 02:28.855
- I don't know what that is.

02:28.954 --> 02:30.537
- No one does.

02:30.637 --> 02:32.779
She would be here, but there's
a teacher strike in Colorado,

02:32.879 --> 02:35.740
so she's there passing out
CBD gummies on her livestream.

02:35.841 --> 02:37.923
- [chuckles]
At least she's making money.

02:39.404 --> 02:40.745
- Tom makes money, Papi.
- Yeah.

02:40.845 --> 02:43.427
I just have to finish
writing my book, sell it,

02:43.527 --> 02:45.069
get an advance,
and in few years,

02:45.168 --> 02:48.872
the semiannual royalties
will start rolling in, so...

02:48.972 --> 02:50.113
money made.

02:50.213 --> 02:52.214
- That's nice, Tom.

02:53.655 --> 02:55.997
Here, you're gonna need this.

02:56.097 --> 02:58.099
- Oh.
- Okay.

02:59.700 --> 03:01.122
- I'll try to slip this
back into his pocket

03:01.222 --> 03:02.523
without him noticing.

03:02.623 --> 03:04.604
- Yeah, I'm gonna go check
on Camila,

03:04.704 --> 03:05.625
and while I'm in her room,
I'm just gonna

03:05.705 --> 03:07.607
stay in there forever.

03:07.707 --> 03:09.608
- It's so great Camila
has her own room.

03:09.708 --> 03:11.690
Kelvin and Shamiah are
on top of each other every day.

03:11.790 --> 03:13.792
- Hey, me and Tom shared a room
growing up, and look at us.

03:15.793 --> 03:16.834
Yeah, you should do something
about that.

03:16.914 --> 03:19.537
- Yeah. I mean,
maybe it is time to move.

03:19.637 --> 03:20.938
We are a two-income family now.

03:21.038 --> 03:23.540
- But can you afford it?

03:23.640 --> 03:26.122
- Well, we've been
visualizing abundance.

03:27.363 --> 03:28.824
- Yeah, that sounds,
you know,

03:28.924 --> 03:30.465
like, super real,
but, you know,

03:30.565 --> 03:32.627
Maybe you could look into some
type of financial planning.

03:32.727 --> 03:34.668
- Ooh, yes. Like a spreadsheet.
- Ooh.

03:34.769 --> 03:35.829
- I've always wanted to use
a spreadsheet.

03:35.930 --> 03:37.391
- Yeah,
and we can say things like,

03:37.490 --> 03:39.031
"We crunched the numbers."
- Yeah. "We crunched them."

03:39.132 --> 03:40.793
And then, "Are we in the red?
What does red even mean?"

03:40.894 --> 03:42.315
- Yeah.
"Red light, green light."

03:42.415 --> 03:45.558
- Yeah.
- [clears throat]

03:45.658 --> 03:47.119
- Are you well?

03:47.219 --> 03:51.281
- I just think it's a bummer
that you don't know anyone

03:51.382 --> 03:52.723
who could help you crunch.

03:52.823 --> 03:55.926
You know, like, a guy
who's good with numbers.

03:56.026 --> 03:58.488
Maybe a dude
with a smoking-hot bod.

03:58.588 --> 03:59.489
- What does that have
to with it?

03:59.589 --> 04:00.930
- I just work hard
to maintain this,

04:01.030 --> 04:02.531
and no one's said anything
in a while.

04:02.631 --> 04:06.014
- Okay, Connor, would you like
to help us figure out

04:06.114 --> 04:07.055
if we can afford to move?

04:07.155 --> 04:08.496
- Please would be nice.

04:08.596 --> 04:10.578
- No, I'm not doing that.
- No, come on.

04:10.678 --> 04:12.660
I really wanna do this so bad.

04:12.760 --> 04:14.761
Please?

04:15.642 --> 04:17.924
- Okay, here are our
most recent bank statements.

04:19.045 --> 04:20.346
- You have to promise
not to laugh.

04:20.446 --> 04:22.467
- Sarah, come on.
You know I can't do that.

04:22.567 --> 04:23.709
Laughter is involuntary.

04:23.809 --> 04:25.230
- Oh, I already regret this.

04:25.330 --> 04:26.831
- I appreciate you guys
trusting me with this.

04:26.931 --> 04:29.753
And, Denise, you hide it well,
but I know deep down,

04:29.853 --> 04:32.195
you're still a little skeptical
that I'm dating your sister.

04:32.295 --> 04:33.516
- I am.
- It's okay.

04:33.616 --> 04:35.038
Don't deny it.
- I'm not.

04:35.138 --> 04:37.159
I think it's a horrible idea
and it's gonna end badly.

04:37.259 --> 04:38.761
- Well, this is my chance

04:38.861 --> 04:40.862
to prove that she's
with a responsible adult.

04:42.023 --> 04:44.425
Lupe? Ahh. Thank you.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.168
- When did you--

04:47.268 --> 04:48.769
- These are not prescription.
He just likes how they look.

04:48.869 --> 04:51.371
- Okay. Smart.

04:51.471 --> 04:52.692
Not keeping
a lot of money tied up

04:52.792 --> 04:53.973
in a low-interest
savings account.

04:54.073 --> 04:56.775
That's good.
- Yeah, that was intentional.

04:56.875 --> 04:59.217
- So where are you keeping it?

04:59.317 --> 05:00.418
- Keeping what?
- The rest of the money.

05:00.518 --> 05:01.659
- There's no rest. That's it.

05:01.759 --> 05:04.101
- [laughs]
- Connor.

05:04.201 --> 05:05.502
- It's--it's involuntary.

05:05.602 --> 05:06.904
Look, I guess I'm just
a little shocked.

05:07.004 --> 05:09.746
I have more money
in my couch cushions.

05:09.846 --> 05:12.708
That was a joke.
My couch cushions are pristine.

05:12.808 --> 05:14.590
- Okay, we get it.
We're comically poor.

05:14.690 --> 05:16.431
We make soup from shoes.

05:16.531 --> 05:18.353
- When I open my wallet,
a lone moth flies out.

05:18.453 --> 05:20.755
- We have clouds of dirt
that follow us around.

05:20.855 --> 05:22.636
- Sometimes we walk around
in barrels.

05:22.736 --> 05:25.439
- We just need to know if we
can afford a bigger apartment.

05:25.539 --> 05:27.880
- Um, no. No, you cannot.

05:27.980 --> 05:30.202
I honestly don't know
how you can afford to live now.

05:30.302 --> 05:32.004
- Oh, well, some credit cards
let you to transfer a balance.

05:32.104 --> 05:33.885
- Oh, my God. Stop.

05:33.985 --> 05:36.327
Look, if you need money,
I'm happy to help you out.

05:36.427 --> 05:38.369
- Thank you, Connor.
But we can do this on our own.

05:38.469 --> 05:39.570
- Okay.

05:39.670 --> 05:41.411
- So we can't pay
for more space,

05:41.511 --> 05:43.573
but maybe
we can make more space.

05:43.673 --> 05:45.094
We could use
a good decluttering.

05:45.194 --> 05:48.477
- Ooh. Yeah. Me too.

05:49.758 --> 05:52.360
- Yeah, I was gonna say
the same thing.

05:53.922 --> 05:55.343
Such a mess.

05:55.443 --> 05:57.064
- Yeah. I mean,
look at all these papers.

05:57.164 --> 05:58.705
- Those are ours.

05:58.805 --> 05:59.686
- And I'll feel much better
when they're gone.

05:59.766 --> 06:01.708
What can I say?
I'm a minimalist.

06:01.808 --> 06:03.069
- You have three sports cars.

06:03.169 --> 06:05.391
- And a four-car garage.

06:05.491 --> 06:07.312
If anything, I'm under-carred.

06:07.412 --> 06:09.154
I may not be able to help you
fix your finances,

06:09.254 --> 06:10.875
but I can help with this.

06:10.975 --> 06:12.717
- He is ruthless with clutter.

06:12.817 --> 06:14.718
Did you know
he only has three shirts?

06:14.818 --> 06:16.360
- That can't be true.

06:16.460 --> 06:18.321
- Sometimes I let him
organize my purse

06:18.421 --> 06:20.423
just as a little treat.

06:21.424 --> 06:24.046
- I've organized these by date.

06:24.146 --> 06:26.408
- Can you come by tomorrow?

06:26.508 --> 06:28.169
- Hey.
- Hi.

06:28.269 --> 06:30.811
- I can do this.
Do you need to go write?

06:30.911 --> 06:33.293
- No. Actually, I got a ton
of writing done.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.135
Whole chapter, in fact.

06:35.235 --> 06:36.276
It's about how in third grade,
I was walking in the woods

06:36.356 --> 06:38.017
and I saw a dead bird.

06:38.117 --> 06:39.378
That's not--
- I can read it when it's done.

06:39.478 --> 06:40.740
- Okay, yeah, you can read it
when I'm done.

06:40.840 --> 06:43.742
But the point is,
your dad took the kids all day.

06:43.842 --> 06:46.584
He even put them down.
- Really? My dad?

06:46.683 --> 06:48.946
He must have complained
about government corruption

06:49.046 --> 06:51.788
until they passed out
from boredom.

06:51.888 --> 06:53.470
So the kids are down,

06:53.570 --> 06:56.672
and we have nothing else to do
at 8:30 on a Friday night?

06:56.772 --> 06:58.154
- Looks that way.

06:58.254 --> 07:00.255
- Wow, I can't remember
the last time that happened.

07:02.137 --> 07:04.359
Should we...

07:04.459 --> 07:05.480
go to bed?

07:05.580 --> 07:06.801
- I'm not that tired.

07:06.901 --> 07:08.902
Maybe we should finally watch
"Squid Game."

07:09.703 --> 07:14.066
Oh, "go to bed," go to bed.
Yes, I'd love to go to bed.

07:15.788 --> 07:17.089
- Hi.

07:17.189 --> 07:19.991
- [coughing]

07:21.432 --> 07:24.135
- Okay. This isn't ideal.

07:24.235 --> 07:26.977
- No.
Should we go out to the car?

07:27.077 --> 07:28.298
- It's like we're teenagers

07:28.398 --> 07:30.400
trying to not let
my dad catch us.

07:32.521 --> 07:34.223
- Sneaking around
is kind of hot.

07:34.323 --> 07:35.704
- We could pretend

07:35.804 --> 07:38.666
you're picking me up
for the big dance.

07:38.766 --> 07:41.389
- Oh, yeah, and I'm
the coolest guy in school

07:41.489 --> 07:44.451
'cause I got
a brand-new minivan.

07:49.055 --> 07:51.157
- [groans]

07:51.257 --> 07:52.918
- Morning.

07:53.018 --> 07:54.319
- You let me sleep in?

07:54.419 --> 07:56.421
- Ah, come on,
you looked so peaceful.

07:57.622 --> 07:59.964
- That seat belt left a mark.

08:00.064 --> 08:01.925
- Did it?

08:02.025 --> 08:04.648
But you know what?
It was worth it.

08:04.748 --> 08:06.049
[Roberto speaking indistinctly]
- What was that?

08:06.149 --> 08:07.610
- It's your dad, he's playing
with the kids again.

08:07.710 --> 08:09.131
I had no idea he did voices.

08:09.231 --> 08:11.373
- What are you talking about?
What voices?

08:11.473 --> 08:14.055
- I am Rata the rat,

08:14.155 --> 08:18.018
and somebody ate my cheese.

08:18.118 --> 08:20.821
Don't tell Rata
that I ate his cheese,

08:20.921 --> 08:23.183
or I will be in the doghouse.

08:23.283 --> 08:25.745
- What am I looking at?
- A puppet show.

08:25.845 --> 08:28.106
Rata's actually a pretty
well-defined character.

08:28.207 --> 08:30.869
Fascinating backstory.
He and the dog are brothers.

08:30.969 --> 08:32.910
- I don't understand.
- Well...

08:33.010 --> 08:35.112
obviously one of them
is adopted.

08:35.212 --> 08:38.635
- At least we can both agree,
we both hate cats.

08:38.735 --> 08:40.917
- He bought them
a puppet theater?

08:41.017 --> 08:43.599
- No, he made it himself.
Got up at 5:30.

08:43.699 --> 08:46.962
- Wow. When I was a kid,
I begged him to make me

08:47.062 --> 08:49.644
this little castle playhouse,
and nothing.

08:49.744 --> 08:50.725
- Come on,
isn't this a good thing?

08:50.825 --> 08:51.726
He's playing
with his grandkids.

08:51.826 --> 08:52.887
- Of course.

08:52.987 --> 08:54.688
Yeah, no, it's great.
It's so great.

08:54.788 --> 08:56.770
- Right this way, Your Majesty.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.251
- They're having a tea party?

08:58.351 --> 08:59.932
- There we go.

09:00.032 --> 09:01.373
- Oh, don't worry, he'll go
back to the puppet show.

09:01.473 --> 09:03.515
He just likes to leave us
wanting more.

09:05.557 --> 09:07.178
- Who's ready to declutter?

09:07.278 --> 09:08.419
- Oh, you brought
your own trash bags.

09:08.519 --> 09:09.700
- I have a preferred brand.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.222
Triple-ply,
they really take a punch.

09:12.322 --> 09:14.904
- That sounds kind of intense.
- All right.

09:15.004 --> 09:17.747
We are gonna streamline
your operation.

09:17.847 --> 09:19.548
If I can do it for
a Slovakian diet pill company,

09:19.648 --> 09:20.789
I can do it for you,

09:20.889 --> 09:22.631
and hopefully
with fewer lawsuits.

09:22.731 --> 09:24.312
[laughs]

09:24.412 --> 09:25.953
All right,
should we start in the bedroom?

09:26.053 --> 09:27.435
- Maybe we don't need
to start in the bedroom.

09:27.535 --> 09:29.436
- I don't think there's a need
to start out in the bedroom.

09:29.536 --> 09:31.598
- Yeah, I'm gonna need
a bigger bag.

09:31.698 --> 09:33.980
I mean, you guys gotta have
some space in here somewhere.

09:36.102 --> 09:37.963
Why are there dishes in here?
- The kitchen's a little tight.

09:38.063 --> 09:39.564
- But this is the bedroom.

09:39.664 --> 09:42.046
What do we have here?

09:42.146 --> 09:44.408
A drawer full of winter boots.

09:44.508 --> 09:46.730
- The front closet
is a little tight.

09:46.830 --> 09:50.533
- And you gotta have
a full drawer of CDs.

09:50.633 --> 09:52.055
- The whole place
is a little tight.

09:52.155 --> 09:53.696
But if we take what's in here
and put it out there,

09:53.796 --> 09:55.978
then out there is a mess.

09:56.078 --> 09:57.779
- Where do you put
your clothes?

09:57.879 --> 09:59.861
- In the closet.

09:59.961 --> 10:01.662
- I feel like
you're gonna judge us.

10:01.762 --> 10:03.764
- I'm not gonna judge you.
Come on.

10:06.326 --> 10:09.509
And I lied.
What is wrong with you?

10:09.609 --> 10:12.191
- Connor.
- Sorry. It's just a lot.

10:12.291 --> 10:14.072
But that's why I'm here.

10:14.172 --> 10:15.514
- Okay, yeah, we might be
a little cluttered,

10:15.614 --> 10:16.795
but we can't just throw
everything away.

10:16.895 --> 10:18.076
It's so wasteful.

10:18.176 --> 10:20.798
- Maybe we can sell
some stuff online.

10:20.898 --> 10:21.838
- That's what I'm talking
about.

10:21.939 --> 10:24.161
Denise came to play.
All right.

10:24.261 --> 10:27.243
So what do you have under here?

10:27.343 --> 10:28.884
What is this, eight tracks?

10:28.984 --> 10:30.986
- Ooh, no, no, no!
- Oh, that's private!

10:33.708 --> 10:37.571
Okay, so we have a sex life.

10:37.671 --> 10:39.713
- I'm just impressed
by the variety.

10:41.595 --> 10:44.297
- Oh, Mom, after school,
can Grandpa take us to the zoo?

10:44.397 --> 10:45.778
- Oh, I don't know.

10:45.878 --> 10:46.939
He already took you
on a pony ride,

10:47.039 --> 10:48.700
and you played hide-and-seek
for three hours.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.542
I bet he's too tired
for the zoo.

10:50.642 --> 10:52.263
- Well, your mother's
probably right.

10:52.363 --> 10:53.865
I would be too tired.

10:53.965 --> 10:55.946
Unless we stop
for ice cream first.

10:56.046 --> 10:58.348
- Yes! Best yayo ever.

10:58.448 --> 11:00.810
- Who are you?
- I'm Yayo.

11:02.011 --> 11:04.793
- Do you need breakfast?
- No, Yayo's making pancakes.

11:04.893 --> 11:06.675
- Oh.
He doesn't know how to do that.

11:06.775 --> 11:08.557
I'll make you
some French toast.

11:08.657 --> 11:09.757
- But I'm making pancakes.

11:09.857 --> 11:10.918
- You've never made pancakes.

11:11.018 --> 11:12.920
- Ooh, Yayo's making pancakes.

11:13.020 --> 11:15.002
- Chocolate chip okay?
- Uh, yeah.

11:15.102 --> 11:16.603
- Okay, Papi, just put down
the whisk, okay?

11:16.703 --> 11:17.963
You're not a pancake guy.

11:18.064 --> 11:20.166
You're a sit-down-quietly-
with-the-paper guy

11:20.266 --> 11:22.968
or, "Everyone outside,
I've had a long day," guy.

11:23.068 --> 11:25.810
You're not and you will
never be a pancake guy.

11:25.910 --> 11:28.773
- Oh, those actually
look pretty good.

11:28.873 --> 11:31.535
- All right, yeah, they look--
they look fluffy and light.

11:31.635 --> 11:33.977
But I bet they taste...

11:34.077 --> 11:36.219
delicate and moist and--

11:36.319 --> 11:37.380
wow, is that vanilla?

11:37.480 --> 11:39.341
- Mm, gives it kind of
a zing, you know.

11:39.441 --> 11:40.442
- So, what, you've always known
how to make these?

11:40.522 --> 11:42.264
You just--you never did?

11:42.364 --> 11:44.826
- Okay, let's calm down,
not say anything we'll regret.

11:44.926 --> 11:46.587
Just take a deep breath,

11:46.687 --> 11:50.270
and maybe share
some bites of that pancake.

11:50.370 --> 11:53.633
- Where were my pancakes? Huh?
Where was my tea party?

11:53.733 --> 11:54.994
- Honey, I was always working.

11:55.094 --> 11:56.796
- I'm working. I'm working now.

11:56.896 --> 11:58.597
And I still have time
for French toast.

11:58.697 --> 12:00.639
- Ooh, we having
French toast too?

12:00.739 --> 12:02.360
- Because I make time, Papi.

12:02.460 --> 12:05.443
I guess it wasn't
important enough to you.

12:05.543 --> 12:07.544
Have fun at the zoo.

12:09.186 --> 12:11.407
- [sighs]

12:11.507 --> 12:14.010
- Hey...

12:14.110 --> 12:16.111
I'm not mad at you, so...

12:18.553 --> 12:20.555
Okay.

12:22.797 --> 12:24.138
- All right. I'm back.

12:24.238 --> 12:25.338
How we doing?

12:25.439 --> 12:27.020
- So good.
We sold, like, five things.

12:27.120 --> 12:28.862
- Great.
- We also bought a few things.

12:28.962 --> 12:30.963
- How many things?
- Like, ten things.

12:31.804 --> 12:33.746
- But look how cute
this vase is.

12:33.846 --> 12:36.067
- Yeah, and we got an umbrella

12:36.167 --> 12:38.870
that says,
"Rain today, flowers tomorrow."

12:38.970 --> 12:41.392
- Guys,
the goal was to declutter,

12:41.492 --> 12:42.793
not re-clutter.

12:42.893 --> 12:44.894
- But the deals are so good.

12:45.415 --> 12:48.718
- Look, I didn't wanna do this
'cause it can get intense.

12:48.818 --> 12:50.959
But I have my own
decluttering system.

12:51.059 --> 12:53.842
It's like Marie Kondo,
except it kicks ass.

12:53.942 --> 12:55.563
Instead of asking
if something brings you joy,

12:55.663 --> 12:58.806
you have three seconds
to justify it, or it's gone.

12:58.906 --> 13:00.087
- Yeah, I don't think
we really need that.

13:00.187 --> 13:02.169
- Bag of loose screws.
Justify this.

13:02.269 --> 13:04.130
- They are screws,
and they screw things.

13:04.230 --> 13:06.052
- Gone.

13:06.152 --> 13:07.893
Justify this.

13:07.993 --> 13:09.815
- It's my fav--
one of favorite hats.

13:09.915 --> 13:11.016
I wear it every nine years.

13:11.116 --> 13:12.697
- Gone.

13:12.797 --> 13:14.819
Justify this.
- Easy. Favorite book.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.380
- Mm-hmm.

13:16.480 --> 13:18.061
But what about this?

13:18.161 --> 13:19.262
- That is also
my favorite book.

13:19.362 --> 13:21.784
- But why do you have
three copies?

13:21.884 --> 13:24.086
- Well, in case we lose
the first two copies.

13:26.248 --> 13:28.650
- Hey. Fixing the sink, huh?

13:29.691 --> 13:31.032
Sinks, am I right?

13:31.132 --> 13:33.654
They're like...
toilets for food.

13:35.375 --> 13:37.878
Look, this is awkward
for me too,

13:37.978 --> 13:40.079
but I think there's something
we should talk about.

13:40.179 --> 13:43.442
- Is this about what I saw
in the car last night?

13:43.542 --> 13:45.203
- Oh, my God, you saw us?

13:45.303 --> 13:47.125
That was not
what that looked like.

13:47.225 --> 13:51.088
Marina and I were rearranging
the seats for a road trip

13:51.188 --> 13:54.011
last night for an hour,
listening to Portishead.

13:54.111 --> 13:57.013
- I mean
the check engine light was on.

13:57.113 --> 13:59.935
- Oh, okay.

14:00.035 --> 14:02.898
I was talking about how upset
Marina was this morning.

14:02.998 --> 14:04.539
- Yeah, I know.

14:04.639 --> 14:08.823
I thought that playing with
the kids would make her happy.

14:08.923 --> 14:10.944
- Well, it did,
but I think she wishes

14:11.044 --> 14:12.986
she could've had
some of that with you too.

14:13.086 --> 14:15.708
- Look, Tom,
I see myself as a provider.

14:15.808 --> 14:17.390
Always have.

14:17.490 --> 14:18.911
I worked at the factory.

14:19.011 --> 14:21.553
I made car doors for years,
and that put a roof

14:21.653 --> 14:23.755
over our heads
and food on the table.

14:23.855 --> 14:25.276
- That's totally
understandable.

14:25.376 --> 14:26.997
- Look at you.

14:27.097 --> 14:29.079
You barely provide
for your family.

14:29.179 --> 14:30.920
Your house is falling apart.

14:31.020 --> 14:33.322
Your family
constantly laughs at you.

14:33.422 --> 14:35.424
But does that make you
any less a man?

14:37.466 --> 14:38.407
- So are you gonna answer that,

14:38.507 --> 14:39.728
or do you want me
to answer that?

14:39.828 --> 14:42.170
- Look Tom,
I know I'm hard on you.

14:42.270 --> 14:45.672
But in many ways,
I admire you.

14:47.434 --> 14:49.055
- Wait. Really?

14:49.155 --> 14:51.657
Seriously? What do you mean?
Like, can you list it?

14:51.757 --> 14:52.858
- You're ruining it.
- Yeah, no, I know.

14:52.958 --> 14:54.259
I was ruining it
when I was saying it.

14:54.359 --> 14:55.981
- Tom, you don't even know
what you have.

14:56.081 --> 14:59.544
You have a connection to
your family, to your children.

14:59.644 --> 15:02.066
That's something I never had.

15:02.166 --> 15:04.308
Even when I was home,
I was never there for them.

15:04.408 --> 15:07.750
I just left that responsibility
to Marina's mother.

15:07.850 --> 15:10.112
I'm retired,
and my wife is gone.

15:10.212 --> 15:12.754
And I realize now that
I should've spent less time

15:12.854 --> 15:14.516
working on the house
and more time

15:14.616 --> 15:16.617
working on the people
who lived in the house.

15:19.220 --> 15:20.681
- Wow.

15:20.781 --> 15:22.782
I--I didn't know
you felt that way.

15:23.823 --> 15:25.725
I didn't know you could feel.

15:25.825 --> 15:27.566
[both chuckle]

15:27.666 --> 15:29.088
- Yeah.

15:29.188 --> 15:31.850
Look, I messed up
with my children,

15:31.950 --> 15:34.012
and I don't wanna mess up
with my grandchildren.

15:34.112 --> 15:35.293
- Well, here's the thing.

15:35.393 --> 15:37.394
What if it's not too late
for you and Marina?

15:40.477 --> 15:42.478
- Yeah, well...

15:44.200 --> 15:46.201
Maybe.

15:46.962 --> 15:49.504
Hey, can you finish this?
I--I gotta do something.

15:49.604 --> 15:51.606
- Yeah.

15:53.367 --> 15:55.189
Wait, sorry.
What is this?

15:55.289 --> 15:56.830
- Okay, justify this.

15:56.930 --> 15:58.111
- We've been doing this
for so long.

15:58.211 --> 15:59.953
- And you've justified
almost everything.

16:00.053 --> 16:01.914
No one still fits
in this jacket.

16:02.014 --> 16:03.756
- True, but that's
what Shamiah was wearing

16:03.856 --> 16:05.077
when we first met her.

16:05.177 --> 16:08.279
She was almost six.
- Five and ten months.

16:08.379 --> 16:10.241
- She didn't take it off
for a week.

16:10.341 --> 16:11.882
- This was before we adopted
her and Kel

16:11.982 --> 16:13.724
and we were still
fostering them.

16:13.824 --> 16:15.966
And she didn't know
if she was gonna stay.

16:16.066 --> 16:18.087
- Yeah.

16:18.187 --> 16:19.929
- Okay. How 'bout this?

16:20.029 --> 16:22.171
You hate video games.
Justify this.

16:22.271 --> 16:23.251
- Well, yeah,
but that was Kelvin's.

16:23.351 --> 16:24.613
I mean,
when he switched schools,

16:24.713 --> 16:25.814
he didn't have any friends,

16:25.914 --> 16:27.255
and so we learned
to play it with him.

16:27.355 --> 16:28.816
- Yeah, we got really good.

16:28.916 --> 16:30.017
- We got super good at it,
yeah.

16:30.117 --> 16:33.260
- All right, I will put this
with the jacket

16:33.360 --> 16:36.622
and Denise's grandma's
gravy boat.

16:36.722 --> 16:38.184
- Grandma Iris loved her gravy.

16:38.284 --> 16:40.465
It didn't love her, though.
Rest in peace.

16:40.565 --> 16:42.667
- You guys are justifying
almost everything.

16:42.767 --> 16:44.014
If you want this to work,
you have to be ruthless.

16:44.024 --> 16:45.230
Oh, my God,
is this Benny Bear?

16:45.330 --> 16:48.233
- Yeah, remember, you gave him
to me that summer

16:48.333 --> 16:50.675
that I was really nervous
about going to camp.

16:50.775 --> 16:52.596
You know, it's been so long,
I guess we can toss it.

16:52.696 --> 16:53.757
- You can't throw away

16:53.857 --> 16:56.359
Benjamin Bearworth,
attorney at claw.

16:56.459 --> 16:58.681
Are you kidding me?
Look at this little briefcase.

16:58.781 --> 17:00.903
- Yeah.
- What?

17:04.426 --> 17:06.047
Okay, I guess we're done here.

17:06.147 --> 17:07.848
- Wait, but we still have
so much stuff.

17:07.948 --> 17:09.690
- Yeah,
and you should keep all of it.

17:09.790 --> 17:13.013
Look, the Justify This System,
patent pending,

17:13.113 --> 17:15.935
is foolproof but only when
it comes to financial value.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.277
It was never designed
to handle...

17:20.078 --> 17:22.540
- Emotions?
- Sure.

17:22.640 --> 17:23.661
- Honestly, it just seemed

17:23.761 --> 17:24.402
like a bunch
of pointing and yelling.

17:24.482 --> 17:26.303
- Your place isn't packed

17:26.403 --> 17:27.544
because you're weirdo hoarders.

17:27.644 --> 17:29.646
It's packed with memories.

17:30.367 --> 17:32.348
You're right, I can't
throw out any of this stuff.

17:32.448 --> 17:33.789
- Thanks for trying to help.

17:33.889 --> 17:35.111
- It's too bad.

17:35.211 --> 17:36.872
Thought we could
really free up some space.

17:36.972 --> 17:39.314
- Yeah.
- You still could.

17:39.414 --> 17:42.176
- I appreciate you holding on
to this stuff for us.

17:43.457 --> 17:45.239
- Yeah, we'll have room
for it one day.

17:45.339 --> 17:47.921
- These are memories.
You can't toss memories.

17:48.021 --> 17:49.602
But you can put them somewhere

17:49.702 --> 17:51.204
where I won't be able
to see them.

17:51.304 --> 17:53.565
- I'll put them in that room
you can never find.

17:53.665 --> 17:55.887
- I can never find that room.

17:55.987 --> 17:59.370
- Hey, Con, thank you again
for your help.

17:59.470 --> 18:02.092
And we just thought
that you might wanna

18:02.192 --> 18:04.614
hang on to this little guy.

18:04.714 --> 18:06.416
- Ah, thanks.
- What do you think?

18:06.516 --> 18:07.457
Yeah?
- Whatever.

18:07.557 --> 18:09.558
- [chuckles]

18:10.399 --> 18:12.801
- I should probably just
hang on to him for safekeeping.

18:16.604 --> 18:18.346
- Hey, there she is.

18:18.446 --> 18:19.667
- Hey.
- How you feeling?

18:19.767 --> 18:21.068
- Embarrassed.

18:21.168 --> 18:24.110
I've been beating myself up
all day at work.

18:24.210 --> 18:26.552
I can't believe
I snapped at him like that.

18:26.652 --> 18:29.635
- Well, he did make pancakes.
I mean, he crossed a line.

18:29.735 --> 18:32.037
- It's just, I'm watching
my kids get something

18:32.137 --> 18:35.279
from my dad
that I never got from him.

18:35.379 --> 18:37.841
It's so dumb.
What am I, jealous of my kids?

18:37.941 --> 18:39.142
- Hey, come on, I'm jealous
of the twins all the time.

18:39.222 --> 18:40.684
All they do is eat,
sleep, and poop.

18:40.784 --> 18:42.325
It's literally heaven.

18:42.425 --> 18:44.447
- I guess at least the kids
are getting the new,

18:44.547 --> 18:46.088
improved version of my dad.

18:46.188 --> 18:48.190
[knock at door]

18:48.630 --> 18:51.713
- [speaking Spanish]

18:54.515 --> 18:56.516
- Wow, Papi.

18:57.677 --> 18:59.659
- I'm sorry I didn't have time
to paint it.

18:59.759 --> 19:01.661
- [speaking Spanish]

19:01.761 --> 19:03.382
- You wanna see inside?
- Yes.

19:03.482 --> 19:05.184
- Okay.

19:05.284 --> 19:07.225
- [gasps]
- [mimics mechanical whirring]

19:07.325 --> 19:09.327
- [laughs]

19:12.730 --> 19:14.231
Are we having a tea party?

19:14.331 --> 19:16.553
- Well, I thought that maybe
you would like something

19:16.653 --> 19:18.755
a little stronger than tea.

19:18.855 --> 19:20.436
- Wow, you know me really well.

19:20.536 --> 19:22.798
- [chuckles]

19:22.898 --> 19:24.439
Okay.

19:24.539 --> 19:27.562
- I can't believe you did
all of this for me.

19:27.662 --> 19:31.245
- Well, I should have done it
a lot sooner, muñequita.

19:31.345 --> 19:32.366
I'm sorry.

19:32.466 --> 19:34.207
- I'm sorry, too, about before.

19:34.307 --> 19:37.370
I mean, you have done
so much for me.

19:37.470 --> 19:39.451
You taught me how to be
strong and independent

19:39.551 --> 19:43.735
and sometimes,
according to Tom, intimidating.

19:43.835 --> 19:47.137
- I've seen him intimidated
by a squirrel, so...

19:47.237 --> 19:48.419
- I mean, you didn't have time
for all of this.

19:48.519 --> 19:50.020
You were working.

19:50.120 --> 19:52.182
It's not a complaint.
I get it.

19:52.282 --> 19:54.744
I work hard too.
I guess I got that from you.

19:54.844 --> 19:57.426
- Yes.

19:57.526 --> 20:00.929
When I see you with your kids,
how you are with them...

20:03.331 --> 20:05.813
You got a whole lot
from your mother too.

20:08.214 --> 20:10.797
I think that you're
the best of both of us.

20:10.897 --> 20:13.239
- Gracias, Papi.

20:13.339 --> 20:15.320
- More tea, Your Majesty?

20:15.420 --> 20:18.643
- Oh, yes, in my delicate
little teacup, please.

20:18.743 --> 20:20.745
Keep it coming, keep it coming.
Top it up.

20:22.226 --> 20:24.568
- [gasps] It looks
so much better in here.

20:24.668 --> 20:26.609
- And we have drawers.

20:26.709 --> 20:29.772
- We have drawers. Aw.

20:29.872 --> 20:31.413
Where's Kelvin?
Dinner's almost ready.

20:31.513 --> 20:34.656
- In the den.
- The den.

20:34.756 --> 20:36.758
I like the sound of that.

20:38.039 --> 20:40.060
- Can I help you?
- It's dinnertime.

20:40.160 --> 20:41.782
- I'll take it in here.

20:41.882 --> 20:42.542
[video game blipping]

20:42.642 --> 20:44.644
- Get out of the closet.

20:46.726 --> 20:48.187
- I'm Dave. Open up.

20:48.287 --> 20:50.269
- I said Dave's not here.

20:50.369 --> 20:51.990
- Our dad never did
puppet shows for us.

20:52.090 --> 20:53.231
- Yeah, he did.

20:53.331 --> 20:55.333
Remember when he gave us
the sex talk?

20:56.974 --> 20:58.976
Wait, was that just for me?

20:59.576 --> 21:00.597
Oh, man.

21:00.697 --> 21:02.398
- I'm Tommy.

21:02.498 --> 21:06.882
And I'm so scared,
I'm going to pee my pants.

21:06.982 --> 21:08.563
[laughter]

21:08.663 --> 21:10.405
- Sorry.
What is this show called?

21:10.505 --> 21:12.006
- "Tommy the Cowardly Kitty."

21:12.106 --> 21:14.728
- Any chance
it's about a kitty cat that

21:14.828 --> 21:16.370
learns to be brave in the end?

21:16.470 --> 21:18.532
- No, he just keeps crying
and hiding.

21:18.632 --> 21:22.775
- I'm Tommy, and I can't
even fix my own sink.

21:22.875 --> 21:24.877
- Oh, come on.
[laughter]
