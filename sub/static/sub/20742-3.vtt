<i>Previously, on</i>
The Bridge...

00:19.956 --> 00:20.983
Two different women...

00:21.160 --> 00:22.654
- Cut in the half?
- Yes.

00:22.764 --> 00:24.714
Do you have a girl that
matches this description?

00:24.865 --> 00:27.679
<i>Why is one dead white woman
more important than</i>

00:27.800 --> 00:30.257
<i>so many dead just
across the bridge?</i>

00:37.260 --> 00:39.291
Why did he pick you, Frye?

00:39.452 --> 00:41.081
My husband is having
a heart attack.

00:43.286 --> 00:44.902
Where does it go?

00:45.007 --> 00:46.935
Across. To Mexico.

00:47.044 --> 00:48.076
Board it up.

00:48.186 --> 00:49.938
I don't think that's
a good idea, <i>señora</i>.

00:50.335 --> 00:51.619

00:51.729 --> 00:53.044

00:55.297 --> 00:56.253
_

00:59.024 --> 01:00.602
I'll be back.

Hey, no, no, no, no, no.

_

01:05.355 --> 01:06.522
_

01:06.648 --> 01:07.951
Why did you walk away?

01:08.117 --> 01:09.754
I just didn't want a drink.

01:09.874 --> 01:11.135
Okay.

01:11.234 --> 01:12.622
Want to have sex with me?

01:12.744 --> 01:13.807
When did she come in?

01:13.967 --> 01:14.945
Night before last.

01:15.042 --> 01:16.154
Refused to see the nurse.

01:16.250 --> 01:18.237
Bowl of soup and she was gone.

01:18.833 --> 01:19.946

01:20.263 --> 01:22.060
All right, out!

01:22.334 --> 01:23.311

01:37.240 --> 01:38.402
<i>Longitude and latitude.</i>

01:38.505 --> 01:39.711

03:20.674 --> 03:22.289
<i>SONYA: This bead's a little
bigger than the last one.</i>

03:22.398 --> 03:23.621

Thank you very much.</i>

03:23.919 --> 03:26.122
<i>The old couple said there
were ten walkers to start.</i>

03:26.459 --> 03:27.863

03:27.966 --> 03:28.785

03:28.891 --> 03:30.366
<i>MARCO: Yeah, a woman.</i>

03:30.672 --> 03:34.543
<i>She probably walked to that
road, uh, got picked up.</i>

03:35.710 --> 03:38.726
<i>WADE: First a judge, then a prostitute,

03:38.823 --> 03:41.447
<i>- It doesn't track.</i>
<i>SONYA: - I agree. His MO's changing.</i>

03:41.675 --> 03:43.808
<i>First the voice messages,
then the video?</i>

03:43.918 --> 03:46.291

SONYA: He watched from here.

05:39.678 --> 05:41.016
MARCO: How do you
know he was watching?

05:41.130 --> 05:42.832
SONYA: He had to, to
know if they died.

05:43.908 --> 05:45.765
MARCO: And then he
called our reporter.

05:45.871 --> 05:47.526
SONYA: So he saw
the woman get away.

05:47.630 --> 05:49.273
MARCO: He probably
picked her up.

05:49.929 --> 05:51.574
SONYA: Do you have binoculars?

05:53.285 --> 05:55.092
MARCO: Not on me, no.

MARCO: Oh, it's-it's a joke.

06:04.736 --> 06:06.298
SONYA: Who lives there?

06:07.927 --> 06:10.784
WADE: Well, it makes sense to me
to center this at El Paso PD.

06:10.894 --> 06:12.764
HELLER: Course it does.
It's your place.

06:13.024 --> 06:15.906
WADE: Well, are you inviting us all
to your field office, Richard?

06:16.020 --> 06:18.313
HELLER: I'm just saying, the
FBI might spearhead this.

06:18.428 --> 06:20.025
BREWER: Border Patrol has the
equipment to find this girl.

06:20.129 --> 06:21.491
WADE: Now, that's fine.
Anything that helps.

06:21.610 --> 06:23.467
We find her, we may
well find the killer.

06:23.615 --> 06:28.575
STOKES: Well, we should put out an
APB, check out area hospitals.

06:31.101 --> 06:32.081
WADE: Hank Wade.

06:32.192 --> 06:34.279
STOKES: Manny Stokes,
Sheriff's Department.

06:34.554 --> 06:36.114
WADE: There's something
wrong with your hat, Manny.

06:38.739 --> 06:42.294
STOKES: Uh, of course you probably
know I found Judge Gates.

06:42.419 --> 06:43.905
COOPER: You found half of her.

06:44.244 --> 06:45.464
STOKES: That's accurate.

06:45.819 --> 06:46.452
(Stokes chuckles)

06:46.938 --> 06:49.799
WADE: Okay. We
congregate at our house.

06:49.907 --> 06:52.800
Um, bring your own if you don't
like vanilla type coffee.

06:52.921 --> 06:54.267
(laughter)

06:54.406 --> 06:59.268
Uh, Cooper, I want you two to man
the checkpoint at New Mexico.

07:00.169 --> 07:01.615
COOPER: - Meaning me and him?
WADE: - Yeah.

07:01.760 --> 07:04.962
Yeah, uh, Deputy Stokes seems
to be real dialed in.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.797
STOKE: Oh. Okay.

07:06.925 --> 07:09.591
WADE: - Okay.
STOKES: - Great. I'll drive.

07:09.718 --> 07:11.050
COOPER: Why not.

07:12.081 --> 07:13.546
(indistinct radio
communication)

07:14.316 --> 07:15.204
WADE: Get him talking.

07:15.325 --> 07:17.050
Don't share too
much information.

07:17.561 --> 07:18.972
COOPER: This is
our coyote killer.

07:19.068 --> 07:22.134
WADE: Yeah. He shows up
at the darnedest times.

07:22.309 --> 07:23.485
COOPER: 10-4.

07:37.261 --> 07:38.534

CHARLOTTE: Kate,
it's not even noon.

07:44.821 --> 07:47.916
KATE: I think I can drink
at my own dad's funeral.

07:49.282 --> 07:50.637
CHARLOTTE: You can do
whatever you want.

07:51.876 --> 07:53.699
KATE: I tanked at my mom's.

07:54.499 --> 07:58.747
Wondering why Dad was with you in
Cabo instead of at her graveside.

08:00.615 --> 08:02.871
CHARLOTTE: Your father
loved you very much.

08:05.905 --> 08:08.854
KATE: Why don't you take your
whore money and leave me alone.

08:18.034 --> 08:20.859
ALICIA: So, Charlotte, honey, will
you be, uh, moving back to Orlando?

08:20.980 --> 08:23.131
CHARLOTTE: - Tampa.
ALICIA: - Oh, that's right.

08:23.660 --> 08:26.208
CHARLOTTE: No. That's
not part of the plan.

08:26.457 --> 08:27.736
SHEILA: You'll stay here?

08:28.371 --> 08:29.800
CHARLOTTE: Well, it's my home.

08:30.538 --> 08:33.802
In fact, I would love to get more
involved in civic activities.

08:33.909 --> 08:35.230
The Texas Art Walk.

08:35.335 --> 08:36.480
ALICIA: You like art?

08:36.580 --> 08:37.936
CHARLOTTE: Sure.

08:38.030 --> 08:39.349
And-and you're the cochairs?

08:39.446 --> 08:40.799
ALICIA: Mm-hmm, right.

08:41.107 --> 08:43.664
SHEILA: You be sure and
give us a call about that.

08:56.194 --> 08:57.508

(knocking on door)

08:57.624 --> 08:58.788
MARCO: Hello?

08:58.944 --> 09:00.433
Is anybody there?

09:00.532 --> 09:01.873
It's the police.

09:02.811 --> 09:05.821
(Spanish) Is anybody there?
It's the police!

09:11.402 --> 09:13.114
(lock rattling)

09:13.608 --> 09:14.447
MARCO: Break the lock.

09:14.554 --> 09:15.967
SONYA: Can't do that.

09:18.099 --> 09:20.024
(wind whistling)

09:26.087 --> 09:27.363
Don't do that!

09:27.476 --> 09:28.975
It's illegal.

09:37.229 --> 09:38.736
He burned clothes.

09:46.294 --> 09:47.727
Women's clothes.

09:48.840 --> 09:51.018
MARCO: And you still don't
want me to break in?

09:52.622 --> 09:54.052
SONYA: I'll get a warrant.

09:59.565 --> 10:01.010
(Marco sighs)

10:02.653 --> 10:04.265
Detective Cross.

10:04.370 --> 10:09.859
I need to secure a scene in the
Franklin Mountains, Upper Sunset Road.

10:10.258 --> 10:11.407
That's right.

10:12.590 --> 10:13.900

10:18.200 --> 10:19.403

10:27.538 --> 10:28.839
Oh, hi.

FRYE: Yeah, I'm
looking for my, um...

10:33.655 --> 10:35.260
I'm looking for my-my boss.

10:35.359 --> 10:38.609
She's a haggard brunette woman.

10:42.575 --> 10:43.485
Hey, thanks.

10:43.713 --> 10:45.632
KITTY: You don't look so
fresh yourself, you know?

10:46.480 --> 10:47.542
(Frye laughs)

10:52.558 --> 10:55.159
FRYE: It's a... it's a pretty
big news day in El Paso.

10:55.273 --> 10:56.908
I don't really know
what we're doing here.

10:57.001 --> 10:58.687
WADE: We need to have
a heart-to-heart.

10:58.798 --> 11:00.051
FRYE: I'm not really interested.

11:00.155 --> 11:02.321
SHERRY: Hey, Daniel, sit down.

11:02.792 --> 11:03.710
FRYE: Oh, no. No, thanks.

11:03.805 --> 11:06.145
WADE: This guy chose
you for a reason, son.

11:06.937 --> 11:11.018
He drove your car out onto the bridge,
and he picked you for this bomb nonsense.

11:11.125 --> 11:12.281
FRYE: Yeah, I recall.

11:12.386 --> 11:16.231
WADE: Yeah, now he tips you off to the
location of these new victims. Why?

11:16.385 --> 11:17.880
FRYE: Uh, search me.

11:18.595 --> 11:21.278
WADE: Why do I have the feeling that
you're not telling me everything?

11:21.557 --> 11:22.673
(Frye laughs)

11:23.319 --> 11:25.409
FRYE: I don't really care
about your feelings.

11:25.605 --> 11:28.951
WADE: This fella calls you again, you
come right to us, you understand?

11:29.066 --> 11:30.743
FRYE: In exchange for?

11:30.847 --> 11:33.908
WADE: Uh, any new developments,
we, uh... we talk to you first.

11:34.023 --> 11:35.108
SHERRY: You got one handy.

11:35.234 --> 11:36.797
WADE: I do.

11:38.210 --> 11:40.655
There's a missing girl.
She was with the migrants.

11:40.771 --> 11:42.263
SHERRY: She survived?

11:42.367 --> 11:44.681
WADE: Yeah. Yeah, she, uh...

11:44.949 --> 11:47.677
She walked to the road, we
think, and got picked up.

11:47.769 --> 11:48.888
SHERRY: By him?

11:48.986 --> 11:50.325
WADE: Don't know.

11:51.694 --> 11:53.237
FRYE: You got a name?

11:53.327 --> 11:54.087
WADE: No.

11:54.191 --> 11:55.813
But we have a
contact in Juarez.

11:55.907 --> 11:57.965
Maybe you'll get
further than we did.

12:00.913 --> 12:03.067
FRYE: Oh. Juarez.

12:05.258 --> 12:06.945
MARCO: Why does he leave beads?

12:07.138 --> 12:10.579
SONYA: Maybe just to connect the
bodies, so we know it's him.

12:10.693 --> 12:11.978
(Marco sputters)

12:13.948 --> 12:15.851
SONYA: You do that a lot.

12:16.140 --> 12:17.271
Sigh.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.984
MARCO: Yep, when I'm upset.

12:21.133 --> 12:23.044
You want to know why I'm upset?

12:23.951 --> 12:25.344
SONYA: Okay.

12:26.038 --> 12:29.168
MARCO: Just got an e-mail from the
attorney general in Mexico City.

12:30.648 --> 12:34.330
And I read "By allowing
the ambulance to pass,

12:35.030 --> 12:37.942
Detective Ruiz
compromised a crime scene".

12:38.502 --> 12:40.023
SONYA: There are rules.

12:40.133 --> 12:43.402
MARCO: The man was sick.
He had nothing to do with the case.

12:43.561 --> 12:45.403
SONYA: We didn't know that.

12:47.618 --> 12:48.922
(Marco chuckles)

12:50.147 --> 12:52.584
MARCO: What would it take for
you to drop this complaint?

12:53.299 --> 12:55.038
SONYA: It's not possible.

12:57.047 --> 12:58.534
MARCO: All right.

12:58.657 --> 13:00.303
Yeah. No worries.

13:00.400 --> 13:01.996
I'll deal with it myself.

13:02.968 --> 13:04.853
Oh, uh, pull over.

13:04.957 --> 13:05.831
SONYA: Why?

13:05.933 --> 13:06.989
MARCO: It's Kitty's birthday.

13:07.098 --> 13:08.491
I'm gonna get her some flowers.

13:12.489 --> 13:13.577
(tires screeching)

13:17.940 --> 13:19.314
_

13:21.922 --> 13:23.712
Do you have any American money?

13:24.703 --> 13:25.950
SONYA: Yes.

13:26.448 --> 13:28.392
MARCO: Can you lend me some?

13:28.737 --> 13:32.100
SONYA: - Oh.
MARCO: - Thanks.

13:33.100 --> 13:34.095
(Spanish) Good afternoon.

13:34.248 --> 13:36.607

13:45.773 --> 13:47.949

13:53.728 --> 13:55.134
CHARLOTTE: Excuse me.

13:57.219 --> 13:58.850
_

13:59.610 --> 14:01.705
CHARLOTTE: Excuse me.
You're on private property.

14:02.771 --> 14:04.508
GRACIELA: This is Rio, no?

14:04.951 --> 14:06.105
CHARLOTTE: Who are you?

14:06.208 --> 14:09.530
GRACIELA: You and I spoke
on the phone... briefly.

14:12.180 --> 14:13.717
CHARLOTTE: You sent that lawyer.

14:14.040 --> 14:16.474
GRACIELA: I understand you
didn't enjoy the casserole.

14:17.031 --> 14:18.337
CHARLOTTE: I told him.

14:18.566 --> 14:20.980
Whatever deal you had
with Karl, it's over.

14:21.846 --> 14:24.608
GRACIELA: I thought we
could talk, woman to woman.

14:27.117 --> 14:29.502
CHARLOTTE: Look, my husband...

14:31.882 --> 14:33.996
He's not who I thought he was.

14:34.108 --> 14:35.760
GRACIELA: Of course not.

14:36.291 --> 14:38.563
CHARLOTTE: But I have to
figure out my life now.

14:39.736 --> 14:41.354
This can't be a part of it.

14:43.264 --> 14:45.157
GRACIELA: You're scared.

14:47.793 --> 14:50.607
This is your ranch now.
Your land.

14:50.727 --> 14:51.616
CHARLOTTE: Yes.

14:51.734 --> 14:53.389
GRACIELA: So we'll be partners.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.181
CHARLOTTE: No.

14:56.782 --> 14:58.491
I'm sorry. I'm not like you.

14:58.766 --> 15:00.230
GRACIELA: But you are.

15:00.595 --> 15:01.915
CHARLOTTE: You don't know me.

15:02.048 --> 15:06.222
GRACIELA: You were poor, and you did
shit things to pull yourself up again.

15:06.338 --> 15:08.434
And you're not going back.

15:09.914 --> 15:12.638
CHARLOTTE: The tunnel
has got to go away.

FRYE: Jesus H. Christ.
Shoot me now.

15:43.340 --> 15:44.656
ADRIANA: You've never
been to Juarez?

15:44.854 --> 15:46.269
FRYE: Yeah, the fun parts.

15:46.364 --> 15:48.697

out her name is Maria.

17:40.882 --> 17:42.521
She's from San Juanito.

17:43.041 --> 17:47.102
This guy wants the ransom paid
by four particular patrons.

17:47.242 --> 17:48.146
SONYA: We reached out to them.

17:48.249 --> 17:49.751
HELLER: Who authorized
you to do that?

17:49.852 --> 17:51.747
SONYA: I don't need
authorization.

17:51.846 --> 17:53.144
HELLER: Correction.

17:53.236 --> 17:57.191
This is now a joint task
force. FBI and El Paso PD.

17:57.633 --> 17:59.247
WADE: Sonya's on my team.

17:59.355 --> 18:01.273
HELLER: And kidnapping
is our territory.

18:01.380 --> 18:03.757
From now on, we run that.
Understand?

18:04.062 --> 18:05.170
SONYA: I guess.

18:06.865 --> 18:09.146
HELLER: - What's her problem?
WADE: - She doesn't have a problem.

18:09.741 --> 18:11.073
CHARLOTTE: Charlotte Millwright.

18:11.181 --> 18:12.367
KITTY: Looking for?

18:12.468 --> 18:14.137
CHARLOTTE: Uh, someone
called for my husband.

18:14.221 --> 18:16.852
MARCO: Marco Ruiz,
Chihuahua State Police.

18:16.951 --> 18:18.931
CHARLOTTE: I remember
you from the bridge.

18:19.040 --> 18:20.156
MARCO: Yes.

18:20.447 --> 18:21.637
What are you doing here?

18:21.728 --> 18:23.659
CHARLOTTE: My husband
was Karl Millwright.

18:24.088 --> 18:25.971
SONYA: His name
came up in a case.

18:26.240 --> 18:27.539
CHARLOTTE: He's dead.

18:28.001 --> 18:30.561
SONYA: - Oh
MARCO: - I'm so sorry.

18:30.657 --> 18:32.188
SONYA: We'll need to
talk to you, then.

18:33.372 --> 18:35.028
CHARLOTTE: I'll talk to him.

18:36.359 --> 18:37.656
MARCO: Sure.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.255
Come this way, please.

18:45.407 --> 18:46.338
SONYA: New homicide?

18:46.457 --> 18:49.194
KITTY: Yeah, woman on
Hueco Avenue, strangled.

18:49.287 --> 18:50.300
SONYA: Hank.

18:50.793 --> 18:52.194
Hueco Avenue.

18:52.805 --> 18:54.500
Hank.

18:56.234 --> 18:57.879
This is Steven
Linder's address.

18:58.822 --> 18:59.953
WADE: No shit.

19:01.255 --> 19:02.823
CHARLOTTE: Karl
wasn't political.

19:02.921 --> 19:04.749
He didn't know that judge.

19:04.982 --> 19:07.042
MARCO: Did he spend
time in Juarez?

19:07.498 --> 19:09.778
CHARLOTTE: We went to
Mexico for horse shows.

19:09.884 --> 19:11.605
We'd drive through Juarez.

19:11.710 --> 19:16.226
MARCO: Did he have any
feelings about immigration?

19:16.574 --> 19:18.944
CHARLOTTE: I think he
thought it was okay.

19:19.599 --> 19:23.819
MARCO: Well, for some reason, he
was named in a ransom demand.

19:25.337 --> 19:26.930
CHARLOTTE: I can't read a
dead man's mind, but I don't

19:27.034 --> 19:29.859
think he'd want me to fork over a
quarter of a million dollars.

19:29.967 --> 19:31.946
MARCO: Oh, no, no.
That's not why we called.

19:32.119 --> 19:34.254
CHARLOTTE: Then why?

19:35.580 --> 19:39.623
MARCO: To see if there was
any personal connection.

19:40.837 --> 19:42.948
CHARLOTTE: My husband
didn't tell me everything.

19:43.954 --> 19:45.711
That's what I'm finding out.

19:46.006 --> 19:47.234
MARCO: Yeah.

I'm sorry.

KENNETH: Look, I hate to
rat a kid out, but, uh...

20:19.665 --> 20:21.553
if he was mine, I'd want to know.

LINDER: Yeah?

at 320 Hueco?

21:05.645 --> 21:06.679
LINDER: Yeah.

21:06.777 --> 21:08.770
MARCO: Down the hall
from Wanda Cunningham?

21:10.317 --> 21:12.212
LINDER: Yeah, I know
Wanda Cunningham.

SONYA: Okay, well, you
need to come with us.

21:42.568 --> 21:45.695

the heck happened to Wanda?

21:45.803 --> 21:47.364
SONYA: Strangled.

21:51.152 --> 21:52.631
LINDER: Oh, Jesus

21:53.106 --> 21:54.756
Is her cat okay?

21:55.379 --> 21:57.224
SONYA: Where were
you yesterday?

21:58.535 --> 22:00.496
LINDER: I was at my trailer.

22:00.670 --> 22:02.945
SONYA: We're searching
that trailer right now.

22:04.305 --> 22:06.349
LINDER: Well, I don't know why.

22:07.456 --> 22:09.373
SONYA: 'Cause we're
looking for a girl.

22:09.535 --> 22:10.773
Mexican.

22:10.877 --> 22:12.931
Crossed the border,
then disappeared.

22:13.028 --> 22:14.583
MARCO: You know a
girl like that?

22:17.294 --> 22:18.691
LINDER: No, I do not.

22:18.796 --> 22:21.160
SONYA: Do you know the
reporter, Daniel Frye?

22:22.253 --> 22:23.728
LINDER: No.

22:23.848 --> 22:25.485
SONYA: You didn't
call him today?

22:27.957 --> 22:31.834
LINDER: No, I... I wouldn't call
him if I don't know who he is.

22:31.956 --> 22:33.826
SONYA: Mmm, can I
check your phone?

22:34.003 --> 22:35.024
LINDER: No.

22:35.133 --> 22:37.532
MARCO: We found burned
clothes at your trailer.

22:39.226 --> 22:41.273
LINDER: Sir, I
burn all my trash.

22:41.386 --> 22:42.993
SONYA: Really?

22:43.405 --> 22:46.165
Why do you have women's
clothes in your trash?

22:47.581 --> 22:49.560
MARCO: Excuse me.
Is something funny here?

22:51.011 --> 22:52.488
LINDER: No.

22:55.222 --> 22:56.843
SONYA: Who's this?

22:58.483 --> 22:59.988
LINDER: Why?

23:00.218 --> 23:02.400
SONYA: Because you're carrying
her picture around with you.

23:04.725 --> 23:05.968
LINDER: Is that illegal?

23:06.067 --> 23:07.561
SONYA: No.

23:09.944 --> 23:10.910

23:11.627 --> 23:13.280
LINDER: That's my sister.

23:14.357 --> 23:15.899
SONYA: What's her name?

23:16.317 --> 23:17.843
LINDER: Marina.

23:18.879 --> 23:21.370
Haven't seen her for 15 years.

23:22.016 --> 23:24.549
We were placed in
separate foster homes.

23:26.531 --> 23:31.026
Look, I'm just a person
who helps people.

23:31.149 --> 23:34.363
MARCO: Are you also a person who
picks up girls on the road?

23:34.504 --> 23:36.094
Takes them to your trailer?

23:36.681 --> 23:37.405
LINDER: No, sir.

23:37.545 --> 23:38.580
MARCO: With bars
on the windows?

23:38.674 --> 23:40.006
LINDER: Yeah, that's
for safety, sir.

23:40.109 --> 23:41.708
MARCO: Would you like
you face broken?

23:41.837 --> 23:43.425
Your fingers snapped off?!

23:43.846 --> 23:45.431
LINDER: I'm just a person
who helps people, sir.

23:45.550 --> 23:46.468
MARCO: Yeah, you
said that before.

23:46.569 --> 23:48.016
We don't need to
hear things twice.

23:48.948 --> 23:50.377
WADE: Marco.

23:58.345 --> 24:00.972
SONYA: Steven, do you have her?

24:01.081 --> 24:02.503
LINDER: No.

24:03.154 --> 24:05.943
SONYA: Because the person who
does killed nine other people

24:06.045 --> 24:09.333
and a judge and a poor
girl from Juarez.

24:10.726 --> 24:11.723
LINDER: Yes, I know.

24:11.831 --> 24:13.209
I saw it on television.

24:13.330 --> 24:14.556
SONYA: Are you that person?

24:14.670 --> 24:16.399
LINDER: No, I am not.

24:21.299 --> 24:22.724
WADE: You can go.

24:24.220 --> 24:25.428
LINDER: Okay.

24:25.549 --> 24:26.943
Can I have that back?

24:31.560 --> 24:33.395
I see you're very upset.

24:33.986 --> 24:36.585
I would be, too, if I was
looking for a lost girl.

24:36.702 --> 24:37.892
SONYA: You are.

24:38.016 --> 24:39.244
LINDER: Sorry.

24:39.768 --> 24:41.218
SONYA: Hmm.

24:42.113 --> 24:44.628
You are looking for a
lost girl, right?

24:46.868 --> 24:49.204
LINDER: Well, um, that's true.

24:51.871 --> 24:54.498
Well, I hope we all find
what we're looking for.

25:07.820 --> 25:09.419
SONYA: You made that worse.

25:09.556 --> 25:11.119
MARCO: I made it better.

25:11.235 --> 25:13.100
You have to shake up
an asshole like that.

25:13.215 --> 25:14.085
WADE: It doesn't matter.

25:14.223 --> 25:15.585
We don't have anything on him.

25:15.706 --> 25:17.077
SONYA: I believed him.

25:19.724 --> 25:20.631
She's wrong.

25:20.737 --> 25:21.862
This guy's up to something.

25:21.961 --> 25:23.771
WADE: Well, let's prove it.

the complaint, but, um... some

I took money from you.

bad in class.

32:56.053 --> 32:57.601

up and down, right?

MARCO: - Yeah.

33:29.314 --> 33:32.185
CHARLOTTE: And right
now, is it up or down?

You were very kind
to me on the bridge.

33:41.140 --> 33:42.495

33:42.667 --> 33:44.435

following the rules.
