Athena-1.
Athena-1, <i>come in.</i>

01:27.726 --> 01:32.129
Athena-1, <i>this is Control. We have
negative copy on that last transmission.</i>

01:32.131 --> 01:35.233
<i>We are showing LOS in the command module.
Please verify. Over.</i>

01:35.235 --> 01:37.636
Mission Control,
this is Atkins.

01:37.638 --> 01:39.638
Something went wrong
with the test.

01:39.640 --> 01:41.672
The crew is dead.

01:41.674 --> 01:44.040
<i>Athena</i> hull integrity
is critical.

01:44.042 --> 01:46.076
I'm headed
to the escape capsule.

01:46.078 --> 01:48.479
<i>Negative, negative.
Reroute to the lab and</i>

01:48.481 --> 01:50.348
<i>secure the canisters
before departure.</i>

01:50.350 --> 01:52.316
But the test subject is loose.

01:52.318 --> 01:54.653
<i>Doctor, the test subject
is a rat.</i>

01:54.655 --> 01:55.988
Not anymore.

02:01.360 --> 02:02.528
What is this?

02:02.530 --> 02:03.760
<i>You have your orders, Doctor.</i>

02:03.762 --> 02:04.995
Open the goddamn door!

02:04.997 --> 02:07.998
<i>Dr. Atkins, it's Claire Wyden.</i>

02:08.000 --> 02:11.538
<i>We'll unlock the escape capsule
when you secure the samples.</i>

02:16.509 --> 02:19.710
<i>Doctor, either you come home
with my research,</i>

02:19.712 --> 02:21.515
<i>or you don't come home at all.</i>

02:48.575 --> 02:50.276
Entering the lab.

02:56.049 --> 02:57.384
Okay.

03:09.127 --> 03:11.061
Mission Control, securing
the samples now.

03:11.063 --> 03:12.166
<i>Copy that.</i>

03:28.313 --> 03:30.180
<i>Warning,
hull integrity critical.</i>

03:35.087 --> 03:36.757
Oh, God.

03:48.368 --> 03:49.701
Open it!

03:49.703 --> 03:51.305
<i>Capsule unlocked.</i>

05:27.766 --> 05:29.601
Mmm. I love that smell.

05:29.603 --> 05:32.035
Brings me right back to
Uganda.

05:32.037 --> 05:33.237
You've been to Uganda?

05:33.239 --> 05:34.905
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

05:34.907 --> 05:37.307
If the jungle doesn't kill
you, the poachers will.

05:37.309 --> 05:39.776
<i>The cops are still after me
from all that shit I pulled.</i>

05:39.778 --> 05:41.613
<i>They call me</i> El Diablo.

05:41.615 --> 05:42.747
I know they don't speak Spanish,
but they might as well.

05:42.749 --> 05:44.482
Right.

05:44.484 --> 05:46.718
- You ever see <i>Blood Diamond?</i>
- Yeah.

05:46.720 --> 05:49.285
Now, I know it's about diamonds,
but it really captures the vibe.

05:49.287 --> 05:51.888
I don't know if it's the same region.
But, you know, it's intense.

05:51.890 --> 05:53.492
<i>Don't mess with
Mother Africa...</i>

05:59.097 --> 06:00.567
Everything okay, boss?

06:02.135 --> 06:03.604
No, it's not.

06:04.970 --> 06:07.304
Don't move a muscle.

06:07.306 --> 06:10.273
Junior here is dropping
a lot of monkey shit

06:10.275 --> 06:12.478
with these made-up stories.

06:16.082 --> 06:18.485
It's very entertaining, though.
It's very entertaining.

06:20.687 --> 06:22.252
I've been to Uganda, man.

06:22.254 --> 06:24.688
And I've been to Hogwarts.

06:24.690 --> 06:26.924
Regardless, if you had any
experience with poaching,

06:26.926 --> 06:30.960
you would know that it's extremely rude
to talk about it in front of a lady.

06:30.962 --> 06:33.598
Oh, it's okay.
I can handle it.

06:33.600 --> 06:37.437
Oh, I know you can. I'm
talking about these ladies.

06:58.323 --> 06:59.857
There shouldn't be any
problems,

06:59.859 --> 07:01.692
but remember you're not
in the classroom anymore.

07:01.694 --> 07:04.828
These are wild animals.
They're very unpredictable.

07:04.830 --> 07:07.833
So remember your training,
and do exactly as I say.

07:09.001 --> 07:10.737
Tell me, what do you see?

07:14.574 --> 07:16.507
The, uh, the young male,

07:16.509 --> 07:21.744
is attempting to establish his
presence with the female.

07:21.746 --> 07:24.683
<i>He's posturing, agitated.</i>

07:24.685 --> 07:26.850
Sounds like someone we know,
right?

07:26.852 --> 07:29.553
Okay, let's remember this is Paavo's
first interaction with the troop.

07:29.555 --> 07:31.155
<i>So we'll just take it
nice and easy,</i>

07:31.157 --> 07:33.894
and we'll see how well he
responds to my commands.

07:36.162 --> 07:37.164
I...

07:44.504 --> 07:45.706
Paavo.

07:47.006 --> 07:49.073
Paavo. Paavo, it's okay.

07:49.075 --> 07:50.944
Femi, Enu, on station.

07:53.212 --> 07:54.444
<i>Good girls.</i>

07:56.082 --> 07:57.217
Easy.

07:58.450 --> 08:00.551
That's far enough, Paavo.

08:00.553 --> 08:02.752
It's okay.
Calm. Calm.

08:02.754 --> 08:04.256
It's me.

08:09.462 --> 08:10.598
Calm.

08:11.797 --> 08:13.463
<i>There you go.</i>

08:13.465 --> 08:14.565
- It's cool, right?
- Yeah.

08:14.567 --> 08:15.569
<i>Good boy.</i>

08:19.104 --> 08:20.771
Good boy.

08:20.773 --> 08:22.241
Good boy.

08:28.446 --> 08:31.417
Uh... Davis.

08:38.423 --> 08:40.823
Everyone stay where you are.
No one move.

08:40.825 --> 08:42.926
Are you crazy?

08:42.928 --> 08:43.961
If you move, we're gonna be in big trouble.
Connor, do not move.

08:43.962 --> 08:46.099
Connor, do what he says.

08:46.898 --> 08:48.232
<i>Paavo...</i>

08:48.234 --> 08:50.136
Connor, don't move!

08:50.835 --> 08:52.169
Paavo!

08:52.171 --> 08:53.907
No! Paavo! Shit!

08:55.340 --> 08:56.641
<i>Help! Help!</i>

09:06.851 --> 09:08.686
Connor! Connor!

09:08.688 --> 09:10.020
It's okay.

09:10.022 --> 09:11.755
George! George!

09:11.757 --> 09:13.691
George!

09:13.693 --> 09:17.329
George!
Easy, buddy. Easy.

09:22.801 --> 09:25.001
Okay. Okay.

09:25.003 --> 09:27.539
Oh, very funny. Very funny.

09:27.541 --> 09:29.674
<i>We're all very impressed.
Yes, yes.</i>

09:29.676 --> 09:31.508
You and I, laughing at your
joke, okay?

09:31.510 --> 09:33.446
New guy, he no laugh.

09:34.379 --> 09:35.945
He cry.

09:35.947 --> 09:39.049
<i>Yeah. Yeah, opposite of laugh.</i>

09:39.051 --> 09:41.318
- Connor, you can get up now.
- Are you 100% on that?

09:41.320 --> 09:42.720
100% sure. You can get up.

09:42.722 --> 09:44.790
And check your diaper.
Come on, let's go.

09:45.957 --> 09:47.059
He cry.

09:49.663 --> 09:50.828
It's okay, it's okay.

09:50.830 --> 09:52.795
He's not gonna kill me?

09:52.797 --> 09:55.357
No, he's not gonna kill you. He
has a unique sense of humor. I...

09:59.471 --> 10:00.671
Uh, no, no.

10:00.673 --> 10:02.543
George no save Davis.

10:03.808 --> 10:05.509
I don't need your saving. No.

10:05.511 --> 10:07.144
George no save Davis.
You didn't save me.

10:07.146 --> 10:09.680
I was fine on my own.
I'm fine.

10:09.682 --> 10:13.320
Stop doing that. Listen, it's important
for you to be nice to Paavo.

10:14.186 --> 10:15.821
<i>He's just a kid.</i>

10:18.190 --> 10:21.027
Poachers killed his entire
family.

10:22.663 --> 10:24.497
<i>He's in your troop now.</i>

10:25.498 --> 10:27.231
<i>I want you to welcome him.</i>

10:27.233 --> 10:28.935
Welcome Paavo.

10:36.207 --> 10:38.077
George, you and I cool?

10:39.244 --> 10:40.846
Come on.

10:47.452 --> 10:49.755
Wow, I can't,
Come on.

10:51.290 --> 10:53.624
I should never have taught you
that. Stop that.

10:53.626 --> 10:55.059
Now, come on. Give me,

10:55.061 --> 10:57.394
Come on! Don't do that.

10:57.396 --> 11:00.430
Stop that! Okay.
All right, listen.

11:00.432 --> 11:03.369
I need you to protect Paavo.

11:07.940 --> 11:09.275
Family.

11:21.454 --> 11:23.820
I started using this new
vegan deodorant.

11:23.822 --> 11:26.122
- How's that?
- I smell like guacamole.

11:26.124 --> 11:28.593
Hey! Davis.

11:28.595 --> 11:29.793
Hey.

11:29.795 --> 11:32.597
Hi. Look,
I just wanted to say,

11:32.599 --> 11:34.931
that was amazing out there.

11:34.933 --> 11:37.000
Ah, thank you.

11:37.002 --> 11:39.969
And I would love to learn more
about those submission techniques.

11:39.971 --> 11:41.941
If you have time for a drink?

11:43.843 --> 11:45.342
Yes!

11:45.344 --> 11:46.809
Your allergies acting up
again?

11:46.811 --> 11:47.977
It's the dander.

11:47.979 --> 11:49.580
- It's the dander.
- <i>Animal dander.</i>

11:49.582 --> 11:51.115
Mmm-hmm. Uh...

11:51.117 --> 11:52.517
Thank you, anyway.
I appreciate it.

11:52.519 --> 11:53.851
I already have plans tonight.

11:53.853 --> 11:54.852
You did great out there today.
Okay?

11:54.854 --> 11:56.819
Oh, I didn't do anything.

11:56.821 --> 11:58.488
Exactly. The first rule of
dealing with hostile animals is,

11:58.490 --> 12:01.658
you wanna remain calm.

12:01.660 --> 12:04.695
I was gonna bake some kale bread
tonight, if you're interested.

12:04.697 --> 12:08.599
No, I know you have a gluten thing.
All right, see you in the morning.

12:08.601 --> 12:11.101
She used the word
"submission." That's a clue.

12:11.103 --> 12:13.303
Should I go back there and tell her your
plans are to hang out with your dogs?

12:13.305 --> 12:16.708
Come on, you know me, Nelson.
I need my "me" time.

12:16.710 --> 12:18.342
Your "me" time?

12:18.344 --> 12:20.477
Okay. Listen, buddy,

12:20.479 --> 12:22.591
since everyone else is afraid to
tell you this, of course I will.

12:22.615 --> 12:23.717
It's, um...

12:24.883 --> 12:26.651
Uh, what's the terminology?

12:26.653 --> 12:29.657
Weird you like hanging out
with animals more than people.

12:30.388 --> 12:32.488
They get me.

12:32.490 --> 12:34.323
Animals like you, they lick you.
They don't like you, they eat you.

12:34.325 --> 12:36.359
You always know where you
stand.

12:36.361 --> 12:38.530
Or where you lie. All chewed up in
their belly 'cause they ate you.

12:38.532 --> 12:41.030
Yeah, that's just some food for thought.
And by the way, you're the food.

12:41.032 --> 12:43.232
All right, get outta here,
you big lug.

12:43.234 --> 12:44.536
Say hi to the dogs for me.

12:44.538 --> 12:45.905
I will.

12:52.411 --> 12:55.181
Girls love him.

12:56.248 --> 12:58.652
I should shave my head.

14:24.235 --> 14:25.968
I got your message about
George. He okay?

14:25.970 --> 14:28.104
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

14:28.106 --> 14:29.341
Davis. Davis!

14:30.610 --> 14:33.278
He's in the grizzly enclosure.

14:34.514 --> 14:35.982
What?

14:50.796 --> 14:52.831
Jesus.

15:04.677 --> 15:06.610
- Put it down.
- What?

15:06.612 --> 15:08.377
You know how he is around guns.
Put it down.

15:08.379 --> 15:09.680
Are you sure?

15:09.682 --> 15:11.884
Put it down.
I'm gonna go talk to him.

15:22.194 --> 15:23.631
Hey, George?

15:24.797 --> 15:26.165
It's okay.

15:26.864 --> 15:28.033
It's me.

15:30.002 --> 15:31.237
It's me.

15:38.009 --> 15:39.345
What happened?

15:42.247 --> 15:43.981
You're sad.

15:43.983 --> 15:45.686
It's okay.

15:46.720 --> 15:48.821
Did you hurt him?

15:50.922 --> 15:52.057
"Sorry"?

15:53.592 --> 15:55.193
It's okay.

16:01.367 --> 16:03.169
Did he hurt you?

16:05.903 --> 16:07.607
He made you scared.

16:08.941 --> 16:09.942
It's okay.

16:11.442 --> 16:12.444
It's...

16:13.912 --> 16:15.848
George.

16:16.582 --> 16:17.717
George.

16:19.218 --> 16:20.550
It's okay to be scared.

16:20.552 --> 16:22.788
It's okay.
Calm.

16:25.557 --> 16:26.693
Easy.

16:36.568 --> 16:39.570
Is it me or is he
considerably bigger?

16:39.572 --> 16:41.905
No, he's definitely bigger.

16:41.907 --> 16:43.641
<i>It's Connor.</i>

16:43.643 --> 16:45.683
<i>Guys, you need to get over
to the gorilla enclosure.</i>

16:58.290 --> 17:00.490
What the hell happened?

17:00.492 --> 17:01.559
We were doing our morning
rounds when we saw the burnt foliage,

17:01.561 --> 17:03.827
and found this.

17:03.829 --> 17:05.329
All right, let me see the kit.

17:21.513 --> 17:23.512
What is it?

17:23.515 --> 17:26.785
I don't know.
But we gotta figure it out.

17:29.154 --> 17:31.821
<i>Stupid piece of crap!</i>

17:31.823 --> 17:33.325
<i>Mini space station!</i>

17:36.028 --> 17:37.263
Are you done?

17:38.665 --> 17:41.464
We just lost billions of
dollars, Claire.

17:41.466 --> 17:43.165
Tens of billions, actually.

17:43.167 --> 17:46.269
Plus $20,000 for the models
you just destroyed.

17:46.271 --> 17:48.174
Our stock got hammered this
morning.

17:48.840 --> 17:50.173
Down 20%.

17:50.175 --> 17:52.142
And you aren't upset,
because...

17:52.144 --> 17:54.978
Because Project Rampage works.

17:54.980 --> 17:57.481
- Do you know how much that's worth?
- Zero.

17:57.483 --> 18:00.717
Because all of our research
was on that space station.

18:00.719 --> 18:02.354
Actually,

18:04.055 --> 18:06.557
Atkins got the research
samples onto the escape pod.

18:06.559 --> 18:08.626
<i>Yes, the escape pod blew up.</i>

18:08.628 --> 18:11.962
But the canisters were
engineered to withstand reentry.

18:11.964 --> 18:14.564
And the American Meteor Society
just reported a meteor strike

18:14.566 --> 18:16.165
in southern Wyoming.

18:16.167 --> 18:20.203
All we have to do is go
get it back.

18:20.205 --> 18:22.004
Well, let's get out there!

18:22.006 --> 18:24.675
Somebody finds that sample,
it leads straight back to us.

18:24.677 --> 18:26.876
Please, enough with the
overreacting.

18:26.878 --> 18:28.678
I am not overreacting, Claire.

18:28.680 --> 18:31.013
There's a reason we were doing
these experiments in space.

18:31.015 --> 18:33.095
And it wasn't exactly for
the betterment of humanity.

18:33.652 --> 18:35.018
Okay.

18:35.020 --> 18:36.886
Look,

18:36.888 --> 18:38.522
you handle the press,

18:38.524 --> 18:40.691
and I'll get Burke to take
care of the canister.

18:40.693 --> 18:42.659
Who is Burke?

18:42.661 --> 18:44.662
Remember that private military
firm we acquired last year?

18:44.664 --> 18:46.495
You called them "Killers
'R' Us."

18:46.497 --> 18:48.898
Yeah?

18:48.900 --> 18:51.036
Well, he's the "us."

19:13.125 --> 19:14.625
Boss.

19:14.627 --> 19:16.796
<i>Wheels up! You boys are
Oscar Mike.</i>

19:17.563 --> 19:18.763
Let's do it.

19:30.709 --> 19:32.107
<i>Where to, Burke?</i>

19:32.109 --> 19:33.276
<i>Wyoming.</i>

19:33.278 --> 19:34.743
<i>Ah, never been.</i>

19:34.745 --> 19:36.812
<i>Lots of mountains,
not a lot of people.</i>

19:36.814 --> 19:39.384
<i>Animals love it.
You'll fit right in.</i>

20:06.244 --> 20:07.944
Shit.

20:07.946 --> 20:09.980
Hey, Mark.

20:09.982 --> 20:11.748
<i>Where the hell are you? Do you
have any idea what time it is?</i>

20:11.750 --> 20:13.119
Yes, yes. Um...

20:14.285 --> 20:15.452
Yeah, sorry.

20:15.454 --> 20:17.956
I am on the freeway,

20:20.525 --> 20:23.460
I know I've already been late
twice this week,

20:23.462 --> 20:25.794
but it will not happen again.

20:25.796 --> 20:28.431
<i>Brett Wyden addressed the
situation with this brief statement.</i>

20:28.433 --> 20:31.668
<i>My sister and I and everyone at
Energyne are stunned and deeply saddened</i>

20:31.670 --> 20:33.604
<i>by the loss of the</i> Athena-1
<i>crew.</i>

20:33.606 --> 20:35.972
<i>These were brave and brilliant
men and women of science,</i>

20:35.974 --> 20:38.040
<i>who were committed to helping
mankind,</i>

20:38.042 --> 20:40.010
<i>and we will continue that work
in their honor.</i>

20:40.012 --> 20:41.211
<i>That's enough.
Thank you.</i>

20:41.213 --> 20:44.880
Helping mankind, my ass.

20:44.882 --> 20:48.818
<i>Since then, Wall Street has kept a
close eye on Energyne's performance.</i>

20:48.820 --> 20:51.186
<i>Now to politics...</i>

20:51.188 --> 20:53.557
<i>What you're looking at is
dramatic video of a fireball</i>

20:53.559 --> 20:56.492
<i>touching down near the San
Diego Wildlife Sanctuary.</i>

20:56.494 --> 21:00.163
<i>It is thought to be debris from
last night's</i> Athena-1 <i>tragedy.</i>

21:00.165 --> 21:01.897
<i>However, it's unclear
if this is related</i>

21:01.899 --> 21:04.300
<i>to one of the park's gorillas
escaping the enclosure</i>

21:04.302 --> 21:05.734
<i>at the sanctuary earlier
this morning.</i>

21:05.736 --> 21:07.470
<i>The gorilla's name is
George...</i>

21:07.472 --> 21:10.473
Hold on a second, Mark.
The car ahead of me...

21:10.475 --> 21:13.175
- It just exploded.
- <i>What?</i>

21:13.177 --> 21:16.146
<i>There is currently no explanation
for the primate's behavior,</i>

21:16.148 --> 21:18.549
<i>and zoo officials are not
commenting at this time.</i>

21:18.551 --> 21:21.751
<i>Our very own Jason Sloss is at
the scene. Jason, what have you heard?</i>

21:21.753 --> 21:23.386
<i>That's right,
Chris and Maria.</i>

21:23.388 --> 21:24.854
<i>I'm here at the San Diego
Wildlife Sanctuary,</i>

21:24.856 --> 21:26.589
<i>and the word
everyone seems to be using</i>

21:26.591 --> 21:29.696
<i>to describe the gorilla's
escape is "surprising."</i>

21:41.607 --> 21:43.577
<i>There. Set her down.</i>

22:08.132 --> 22:11.467
<i>We've secured the canister, but
it was pretty badly damaged.</i>

22:11.469 --> 22:14.104
<i>Whatever was in it
was destroyed.</i>

22:14.106 --> 22:15.241
<i>There's something else.</i>

22:16.808 --> 22:18.742
<i>These wolves were slaughtered.</i>

22:18.744 --> 22:22.545
<i>From the tracks, looks like
another one killed the pack.</i>

22:22.547 --> 22:24.215
It's infected with the
pathogen.

22:26.318 --> 22:29.418
Burke, I need that wolf.
Dead or alive.

22:29.420 --> 22:31.222
<i>Copy that.</i>

22:34.458 --> 22:37.929
This is the list of the unrecognized
hybrids you were talking about.

22:40.565 --> 22:42.666
George's lab results are in.

22:42.668 --> 22:44.336
You're not gonna like 'em.

22:47.406 --> 22:49.271
This can't be right.

22:49.273 --> 22:51.575
His neuromuscular synapse
activity is through the roof,

22:51.577 --> 22:55.310
his blood has lethal
concentrations of growth hormone,

22:55.312 --> 22:56.780
he'd be dead.

22:56.782 --> 22:57.946
Run it again.

22:57.948 --> 22:59.617
I did.

22:59.619 --> 23:02.418
I ran it three times.
His values went up each time.

23:02.420 --> 23:04.087
We can't keep this quiet.

23:04.089 --> 23:05.989
Animal Response is
asking questions.

23:05.991 --> 23:07.625
I just dodged a call. It was
someone from the government.

23:07.627 --> 23:09.091
What do you want me to tell
people?

23:09.093 --> 23:10.926
Tell them nothing.

23:10.928 --> 23:12.194
He didn't do it, Nelson.

23:12.196 --> 23:13.664
Look at him.
Somebody did that to him.

23:13.666 --> 23:16.832
Davis, he killed
a grizzly bear.

23:16.834 --> 23:19.101
Okay? Snapped his neck
like it was a toothpick.

23:19.103 --> 23:21.937
Listen, protocol says, first sign of
aggression mandates immediate isolation.

23:21.939 --> 23:23.173
It's what we're doing.

23:23.175 --> 23:25.474
This is beyond protocol.

23:25.476 --> 23:27.711
Davis, look at him.

23:27.713 --> 23:29.982
- I'm looking at him.
- Really look at him!

23:32.451 --> 23:34.987
That is not the George we know.

23:38.857 --> 23:40.726
If we report this,
they're gonna put him down.

23:43.494 --> 23:45.398
I can't let that happen.

23:51.637 --> 23:54.236
I'll keep everyone off your
back as long as I can.

23:54.238 --> 23:55.407
All right.

23:56.207 --> 23:57.342
Thank you.

24:16.160 --> 24:18.096
I'm gonna figure this out,
George.

24:21.198 --> 24:22.501
I promise.

24:27.171 --> 24:29.338
All right, everybody,
listen up.

24:29.340 --> 24:32.774
I need to find someone who knows
exactly what the hell this thing is.

24:32.776 --> 24:34.277
I found her!

24:34.279 --> 24:36.279
No, that's a lie.
Technically, she found us.

24:36.281 --> 24:38.414
You must be Davis Okoye.

24:38.416 --> 24:40.916
Thank you so much for
your help.

24:40.918 --> 24:42.619
What help?

24:42.621 --> 24:45.120
I'm Kate Caldwell. I'm a
geneticist with Energyne.

24:45.122 --> 24:47.790
Um, you recovered
my research sample.

24:47.792 --> 24:49.893
Yeah, you mean this?

24:49.895 --> 24:53.029
Oh, please tell me you had that
tested for residual particulates.

24:53.031 --> 24:55.397
Yes, that's exactly what I did.
I always do that.

24:55.399 --> 24:56.965
Anytime something
new comes in.

24:56.967 --> 24:58.902
Amy, have this tested
for residual particulates.

24:58.904 --> 25:00.369
I need that back.

25:00.371 --> 25:02.805
Actually, I need some
questions answered.

25:02.807 --> 25:05.608
Like what the hell is that
thing doing to my friend?

25:05.610 --> 25:09.412
Uh, well, I am not allowed
to discuss that with you.

25:09.414 --> 25:11.880
Oh. Okay, well,

25:11.882 --> 25:13.883
I guess we can't help each
other then.

25:13.885 --> 25:16.051
Kate Caldwell, it was good to meet you.
Nelson, show her out.

25:16.053 --> 25:17.388
He's growing, isn't he?

25:18.889 --> 25:21.390
At an unprecedented rate,
right?

25:21.392 --> 25:25.427
Increased strength, speed,
agility.

25:25.429 --> 25:29.167
Demonstrating levels of aggression
you don't see in his species.

25:32.504 --> 25:34.005
Come with me.

25:40.445 --> 25:42.744
Last night, he was seven feet,
500 pounds.

25:42.746 --> 25:45.518
This morning, he was almost
nine feet, pushing 1,000.

25:47.284 --> 25:48.784
His hair?

25:48.786 --> 25:50.752
Yeah, he's an albino.

25:50.754 --> 25:53.074
As far as I know, he's the only
living gorilla of his kind.

25:56.360 --> 25:57.760
He can sign?

25:57.762 --> 25:59.162
Yeah, he can sign
and he's hungry.

25:59.164 --> 26:00.762
Guys, let's get George
something to eat.

26:00.764 --> 26:02.935
It's okay.
There you go, buddy.

26:04.135 --> 26:05.835
It makes sense.

26:05.837 --> 26:07.169
He must be starving.

26:07.171 --> 26:09.105
He's growing so rapidly.

26:09.107 --> 26:10.640
"Makes sense"?

26:10.642 --> 26:12.341
Last night, he killed
a grizzly bear.

26:12.343 --> 26:14.277
The most powerful terrestrial
predator on the planet.

26:14.279 --> 26:16.812
So you tell me right now, Kate,
how any of this makes sense.

26:16.814 --> 26:18.648
Are you familiar with CRISPR?

26:18.650 --> 26:19.949
Yeah, genetic engineering.

26:19.951 --> 26:21.618
It's more like
genetic editing.

26:21.620 --> 26:24.621
I am talking about
extremely specific results.

26:24.623 --> 26:26.321
Check this out.

26:26.323 --> 26:28.825
Sharks are indeterminate
growers, right?

26:28.827 --> 26:30.158
They never stop.

26:30.160 --> 26:32.328
Isolate that gene
and combine it with, say,

26:32.330 --> 26:34.329
the growth rate of a
blue whale,

26:34.331 --> 26:36.165
the strength of a
rhinoceros beetle,

26:36.167 --> 26:38.134
the speed of a cheetah,

26:38.136 --> 26:40.570
And you get one confused gorilla
that could take down a grizzly.

26:40.572 --> 26:43.506
We developed a lot of different
genetic combinations,

26:43.508 --> 26:46.908
so changes will be incredibly
unpredictable.

26:46.910 --> 26:48.877
<i>Right. Okay,
Kate, I get all that,</i>

26:48.879 --> 26:51.047
but it still doesn't explain
to me how he doubled in size.

26:51.049 --> 26:52.749
Guys, we need to get that
food in now.

26:52.751 --> 26:55.251
See, CRISPR only allows
you to alter

26:55.253 --> 26:57.553
the DNA of one cell at a time.

26:57.555 --> 26:59.723
But I developed a system

26:59.725 --> 27:04.926
which rapidly transmits changes to every
strand of DNA in the host's body.

27:04.928 --> 27:07.062
Mr. Okoye, listen to me.

27:07.064 --> 27:10.366
I am the only one
who can cure him.

27:12.671 --> 27:13.738
George!

27:17.841 --> 27:18.877
George! No!

27:25.917 --> 27:27.086
It's not gonna hold.

27:27.752 --> 27:28.753
Kate!

27:33.023 --> 27:34.459
Everybody back!

27:44.135 --> 27:46.138
Not again! Not again!

27:47.906 --> 27:49.472
George!

27:49.474 --> 27:52.107
George! Stop, George!

27:52.109 --> 27:53.111
<i>Davis!</i>

27:54.812 --> 27:56.612
Shit.
Call 911!

27:56.614 --> 27:57.915
Come on!

27:59.250 --> 28:00.450
Look out!

28:19.604 --> 28:21.002
George! George!

28:21.004 --> 28:23.239
George, it's okay.
It's okay.

28:23.241 --> 28:24.773
It's okay.

28:24.775 --> 28:27.342
Yes, I know you're scared.
I'm gonna help you.

28:30.948 --> 28:32.183
No, no, no.

28:34.185 --> 28:35.484
No, it's okay.

28:35.486 --> 28:36.853
Sir, move away from the
animal!

28:36.855 --> 28:38.589
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay.

28:38.591 --> 28:41.156
I'm the primatologist here.
I look after this animal.

28:41.158 --> 28:44.095
I can handle this situation. I just
need you to lower your weapons.

28:44.662 --> 28:45.664
Please.

28:48.099 --> 28:49.502
It's okay. Calm.

28:51.168 --> 28:52.303
Good.

28:55.873 --> 28:57.008
Stand down.

28:58.309 --> 28:59.445
Stand down.

29:00.844 --> 29:03.114
Don't worry, buddy.
I'm gonna help you.

29:06.818 --> 29:07.886
What the hell?

29:10.688 --> 29:11.690
No!

29:16.394 --> 29:17.530
George!

29:43.221 --> 29:44.423
George!

29:45.023 --> 29:46.390
George!

29:47.693 --> 29:49.094
George!

29:59.771 --> 30:02.905
<i>I've never hunted a wolf before.
What do you think, fellas?</i>

30:02.907 --> 30:04.743
<i>Should I bring the .50 cal?</i>

30:06.010 --> 30:08.113
<i>Got 'em.
Treeline.</i>

30:11.381 --> 30:14.618
<i>You sure that's a wolf?
Damn, that thing is moving.</i>

30:14.620 --> 30:16.120
<i>Not for long.</i>

30:34.238 --> 30:35.606
<i>Burke to Base,</i>

30:35.608 --> 30:38.109
<i>Rampage-1 is down.</i>

31:15.079 --> 31:16.647
What do you got?

31:16.649 --> 31:18.449
<i>Nothing yet.</i>

31:20.784 --> 31:22.286
Wait a second.

31:25.455 --> 31:26.755
<i>We got tracks.</i>

31:26.757 --> 31:28.292
<i>Are you seeing this?</i>

31:34.365 --> 31:35.868
Jesus.

31:37.100 --> 31:38.302
A wolf made that?

31:40.639 --> 31:42.675
Maybe I should've
brought the .50 cal.

31:58.356 --> 31:59.658
Boss...

32:03.860 --> 32:05.794
How we playing this?

32:05.796 --> 32:07.131
Nice and easy.

32:16.407 --> 32:18.541
They're in a hurry.

32:18.543 --> 32:19.678
What do you think spooked...

32:21.913 --> 32:24.146
Vinny! Garrick!
Set a perimeter!

32:24.148 --> 32:25.748
- Come on!
- Open fire!

32:25.750 --> 32:27.684
<i>Get it! Get it!</i>

32:27.686 --> 32:28.921
<i>Light him up!</i>

32:32.690 --> 32:34.155
What the hell?

32:34.157 --> 32:35.357
<i>Hit 'em! Hit 'em!</i>

32:35.359 --> 32:37.326
<i>Run! Run!</i>

32:37.328 --> 32:38.860
<i>Garrick, where are you?</i>

32:38.862 --> 32:41.198
<i>- It's on me!
- Run, Garrick!</i>

32:42.166 --> 32:43.933
Come on, get it!

32:43.935 --> 32:45.267
<i>Taylor, get up!</i>

32:45.269 --> 32:46.368
They won't.

32:46.370 --> 32:47.936
<i>Taylor! Go!</i>

32:47.938 --> 32:50.106
The pathogen is doing what
we designed it to.

32:50.108 --> 32:51.909
<i>No! God damn it!</i>

32:57.683 --> 32:59.384
Wilson, check in.

33:00.251 --> 33:01.887
Zammit, check in.

33:03.454 --> 33:05.257
Taylor...

33:33.283 --> 33:34.583
Garcia, get me outta here.

33:34.585 --> 33:35.987
<i>Copy that. Ten klicks out.</i>

33:45.996 --> 33:48.230
<i>Oh, shit! I see him!</i>

33:48.232 --> 33:49.935
Light him up!

33:55.273 --> 33:57.141
Incoming!

33:59.677 --> 34:01.309
<i>Pull up! Pull up!</i>

34:01.311 --> 34:03.311
<i>Oh, no!</i>

34:03.313 --> 34:05.350
<i>I'm losing control!</i>

35:02.005 --> 35:03.308
Sir, let's go.

35:06.310 --> 35:08.648
Out of the van, please.

35:22.826 --> 35:24.328
Who the hell is this?

35:33.604 --> 35:36.942
Mr. Okoye and Dr. Caldwell.

35:38.208 --> 35:40.909
I am Agent Harvey Russell.

35:40.911 --> 35:42.744
Hell of a day, huh?

35:42.746 --> 35:45.515
Science experiments
falling from the sky.

35:45.517 --> 35:47.716
Giant gorilla on the loose.

35:47.718 --> 35:50.853
Just the kind of exciting shit we here
at the government tend to notice.

35:50.855 --> 35:53.288
Where's George? I need to
see him.

35:53.290 --> 35:56.257
And if you're thinking about putting him on
that plane, it's gonna be a big mistake.

35:56.259 --> 35:57.962
I think we'll be all right.

36:00.230 --> 36:03.065
Okay, let's all take a
breath and...

36:03.067 --> 36:05.134
I said I wanna see George.

36:05.136 --> 36:08.304
Or we can get in each other's
faces and see who's the toughest.

36:08.306 --> 36:11.105
Brother, I'm gonna prance
myself right out on a limb,

36:11.107 --> 36:15.076
and guess that no one's ever accused
you of being a people person.

36:15.078 --> 36:19.215
How about you take these cuffs
off and find out yourself?

36:19.217 --> 36:20.485
Brother.

36:24.722 --> 36:26.322
I'll see you on board.

36:26.324 --> 36:28.326
Load 'em up with the ape.

36:29.993 --> 36:32.564
So weird that he didn't take
your cuffs off.

36:45.409 --> 36:47.311
- He's good.
- All right.

36:49.179 --> 36:50.748
Just note it in the chart.

36:52.449 --> 36:54.416
You see that?

36:54.418 --> 36:57.353
Where he cut himself breaking
out of the primate department.

36:57.355 --> 36:59.288
There's barely a bruise now.

36:59.290 --> 37:02.123
African spiny mouse.

37:02.125 --> 37:05.996
Its DNA makes it capable
of extreme regeneration.

37:08.031 --> 37:11.866
"Davis Okoye,
Primate Specialist."

37:11.868 --> 37:13.538
Blah, blah, blah.

37:15.806 --> 37:17.873
Army Special Forces.

37:17.875 --> 37:20.476
What are you, some kind of
international man of mystery?

37:20.478 --> 37:25.014
I see a lot of "redacted."
"Redacted, redacted..."

37:25.016 --> 37:27.181
<i>Oh, here we go.</i>

37:27.183 --> 37:31.219
"Transferred to the United Nations'
Special Anti-Poaching Task Force."

37:31.221 --> 37:33.822
Well, I'll have you know that I,
myself, am also an animal lover.

37:33.824 --> 37:35.491
Let's cut the bullshit,
Russell.

37:35.493 --> 37:37.326
I told you, having George
on this airplane is suicidal.

37:37.328 --> 37:39.194
He's on a very powerful
sedative drip.

37:39.196 --> 37:42.331
He will not wake up until we
wake him up.

37:42.333 --> 37:45.300
Sir, with all due respect,
at his rate of growth,

37:45.302 --> 37:48.671
that sedative is gonna become ineffective
long before we're back on the ground.

37:48.673 --> 37:51.707
We factored in his growth rate.
Same as his elevated metabolism.

37:51.709 --> 37:53.709
- Sir.
- And the increased amount of blood,

37:53.711 --> 37:56.978
in his system. We may not be the
brightest bulbs in the room,

37:56.980 --> 37:58.913
but we're doing all right.

37:58.915 --> 38:01.250
<i>Especially considering,</i>

38:01.252 --> 38:04.320
you got another one of your little science
experiments running around out there.

38:04.322 --> 38:05.753
What do you mean another one?

38:05.755 --> 38:07.922
Oh, you didn't know about
the 30-foot wolf?

38:07.924 --> 38:10.224
Oh, sir,

38:10.226 --> 38:13.230
your oversized monkey
is old news.

38:14.364 --> 38:15.998
Jesus.

38:16.000 --> 38:19.602
Weirdos on the Internet
are calling him "Ralph."

38:19.604 --> 38:21.170
Who do you work for?

38:21.172 --> 38:23.172
Sir, I work for the American
people.

38:23.174 --> 38:24.743
Homeland? CIA?

38:26.277 --> 38:28.376
Justice League?

38:28.378 --> 38:30.279
I'm OGA.

38:30.281 --> 38:33.282
I've heard that bullshit before.
"Other Government Agency," huh?

38:33.284 --> 38:34.449
It's clever.

38:34.451 --> 38:36.519
Yes, sir, it is clever.

38:36.521 --> 38:39.521
You see, when science
shits the bed,

38:39.523 --> 38:41.857
I'm the guy they call
to change the sheets.

38:41.859 --> 38:43.891
What's gonna happen to George?

38:43.893 --> 38:46.261
He didn't ask for any of this. He
sure as hell doesn't deserve it.

38:46.263 --> 38:50.232
Whether it is his fault or
not, he is dangerous.

38:50.234 --> 38:52.702
But there's a cure for this.

38:52.704 --> 38:55.204
She helped engineer the
pathogen that infected George.

38:55.206 --> 38:57.606
She works for Energyne.

38:57.608 --> 38:59.743
You mean used to.

39:06.317 --> 39:10.219
"Dr. Kate Caldwell. Ph.D. in
Biochemistry from Stanford,

39:10.221 --> 39:13.154
"with a specialty
in Conservation Genetics."

39:13.156 --> 39:16.994
Recruited by Energyne in 2010.

39:18.728 --> 39:20.929
Fired by Energyne,

39:20.931 --> 39:22.833
<i>a little less than two
years ago.</i>

39:23.635 --> 39:25.266
It gets better.

39:25.268 --> 39:28.270
Caught trying to steal
company hard drives,

39:28.272 --> 39:30.573
and did 13, what I'm sure
were glorious months,

39:30.575 --> 39:34.613
in our beautiful Greenville
Federal Correctional Institute.

39:37.447 --> 39:42.483
Well, I am guessing by the
look on the big fella's face

39:42.485 --> 39:44.154
that this is all news to him.

39:45.989 --> 39:49.257
Enjoy your flight.

39:49.259 --> 39:52.697
Oh. Mr. Okoye,
about your friend.

39:54.130 --> 39:55.933
For what it's worth,

39:57.268 --> 39:59.371
I am truly sorry.

40:09.480 --> 40:11.617
I'm sorry I lied to you.

40:14.284 --> 40:16.485
Can you cure George or not?

40:16.487 --> 40:19.387
I know that Energyne was working on
a counter-measure to the pathogen,

40:19.389 --> 40:20.958
Yes or no?

40:24.462 --> 40:26.063
No.

40:36.139 --> 40:38.072
<i>Claire, I found him.</i>

40:38.074 --> 40:40.041
Some black ops-looking dudes
loaded the gorilla,

40:40.043 --> 40:44.045
into a cargo plane late last night.
You know who that is with them?

40:44.047 --> 40:46.348
No. But clearly, he likes
hitting the gym.

40:46.350 --> 40:47.851
No. The woman.

40:49.653 --> 40:51.422
It's Kate Caldwell.

40:52.156 --> 40:53.889
Dr. Caldwell.

40:53.891 --> 40:56.891
Yeah. What's she doing
out there?

40:56.893 --> 41:00.161
Well, given our history
with her,

41:00.163 --> 41:04.166
her blaming us for putting her in
prison and the death of her brother,

41:04.168 --> 41:08.402
my best guess? Gathering
evidence to screw us over.

41:08.404 --> 41:11.005
I told you, we should've
liquidated her two years ago.

41:11.007 --> 41:13.208
Claire, you can't liquidate
every problem you have.

41:13.210 --> 41:14.577
Agree to disagree.

41:14.579 --> 41:16.911
Claire, I'm serious! Hey!

41:16.913 --> 41:18.580
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

41:18.582 --> 41:20.582
but I don't even care
about the money anymore, okay?

41:20.584 --> 41:22.050
I just don't want
to go to prison.

41:22.052 --> 41:24.418
So if you have a plan,
I would love to hear it.

41:24.420 --> 41:27.292
Brett, I always have a plan.

41:31.929 --> 41:35.396
If you've given a subject
extraordinary genetic gifts,

41:35.398 --> 41:38.233
and unlimited physical potential
combined with unthinkable violent,

41:38.235 --> 41:41.069
and aggressive disposition,
how do you control it?

41:41.071 --> 41:43.237
I don't know,
you give it a chill pill or...

41:43.239 --> 41:45.407
Yes. See?
That wasn't so hard.

41:45.409 --> 41:46.875
Yes!

41:46.877 --> 41:49.711
R-19, the chill pill.
One small dose will stop

41:49.713 --> 41:51.980
an infected creature's
growth and aggression.

41:51.982 --> 41:55.918
And to draw them here, the pathogen
also genetically rewired the subject

41:55.920 --> 41:58.487
to respond to a low
frequency radio wave.

41:58.489 --> 42:00.755
Lucky for us,

42:00.757 --> 42:03.593
this building has some of the most
powerful radio antennas in the world.

42:03.595 --> 42:06.564
I had our team modify
this one last night.

42:17.642 --> 42:19.974
Now, we just have to
turn on the signal.

42:19.976 --> 42:22.244
And those creatures will
do anything to get here

42:22.246 --> 42:23.844
and make it stop.

42:23.846 --> 42:26.447
How do you think that will
go over at 32,000 feet?

42:26.449 --> 42:28.483
That monkey will bring the
whole plane down.

42:28.485 --> 42:30.851
And when the wolf gets here,
we let the military kill it,

42:30.853 --> 42:33.487
and then we collect a sample
of the weaponized DNA.

42:33.489 --> 42:35.593
Then we sell that shit
for a mint!

42:41.197 --> 42:42.668
Wow.

43:37.321 --> 43:38.989
George, you okay, buddy?

43:57.107 --> 43:58.711
Oh, no.

44:05.049 --> 44:06.417
Get up. Now!

44:12.221 --> 44:14.559
<i>Caution. Caution. Caution.</i>

44:21.599 --> 44:23.130
Aim for his body!

44:23.132 --> 44:24.435
Light him up!

44:26.770 --> 44:27.938
Get back!

44:42.786 --> 44:44.152
Come on, come on!

44:44.154 --> 44:45.289
Strap in.

45:01.804 --> 45:03.574
6-1-2-Heavy,
mayday, mayday!

45:08.078 --> 45:09.515
Shit. Shit.

45:28.132 --> 45:29.434
George.

45:53.557 --> 45:54.825
Oh, shit!

46:24.253 --> 46:25.255
Hold on!

46:31.761 --> 46:32.763
Davis!

46:33.330 --> 46:34.599
<i>Hurry!</i>

46:46.909 --> 46:48.409
Davis!

46:48.411 --> 46:49.846
Swing me!

47:05.429 --> 47:06.565
Now what?

47:13.871 --> 47:15.907
We're getting the hell off
this plane!

47:28.451 --> 47:29.655
Hang on tight!

47:43.900 --> 47:46.268
This is insane!
We're gonna die!

47:46.270 --> 47:47.502
Probably!

47:47.504 --> 47:48.806
Now go!

48:16.668 --> 48:17.702
God damn it, Russell!

48:35.619 --> 48:37.152
Holy shit!

48:37.154 --> 48:38.789
You're welcome!

49:00.911 --> 49:02.648
I'm sorry, George.

49:31.775 --> 49:33.444
Where's the body?

49:40.684 --> 49:42.285
There isn't one.

49:44.186 --> 49:46.190
He's wounded but he survived.

49:49.526 --> 49:51.127
Tracks are headed northeast.

49:52.194 --> 49:53.927
And I got zero signal.

49:53.929 --> 49:56.463
I'm gonna see if I can find
a radio, get it working.

49:56.465 --> 50:00.702
Once DoD figures out your
animal survived that crash,

50:00.704 --> 50:02.604
they're gonna have questions
for you two.

50:02.606 --> 50:04.438
What about Energyne?

50:04.440 --> 50:06.775
They know a hell of a lot more
about this than we do.

50:06.777 --> 50:09.544
Yeah, the FBI's checking on
Energyne.

50:09.546 --> 50:11.147
Listen, do me a favor,

50:12.281 --> 50:14.317
don't meander off too far.

50:15.451 --> 50:17.485
Oh, Mr. Okoye.

50:17.487 --> 50:20.054
Yeah.

50:20.056 --> 50:23.591
Thank you for getting this
old cowboy off that plane.

50:23.593 --> 50:25.795
Well, even assholes deserve
a second chance.

50:28.331 --> 50:31.099
Like my grandpappy
always said,

50:31.101 --> 50:33.404
us assholes gotta stick
together.

50:37.107 --> 50:39.074
Have you seen our
satellite footage?

50:39.076 --> 50:40.778
The gorilla survived
the crash!

50:41.579 --> 50:43.911
Yes.

50:43.913 --> 50:46.515
Unfortunately,
so did Dr. Caldwell.

50:46.517 --> 50:48.351
So now what?

50:50.420 --> 50:52.420
The gorilla doesn't
concern me.

50:52.422 --> 50:55.155
It'll respond to the radio
frequency and come straight to us.

50:55.157 --> 50:57.593
Dr. Caldwell is the bigger
problem.

50:57.595 --> 50:59.263
Do you think she told them
something?

51:03.299 --> 51:05.633
Based on the federal agents who are
about to walk through our door,

51:05.635 --> 51:08.136
I'd say she told them
everything.

51:08.138 --> 51:09.273
What?

51:17.047 --> 51:18.513
Ah...

51:18.515 --> 51:20.515
Claire Wyden.
How may I be of assistance?

51:20.517 --> 51:22.483
Agent Park, FBI.

51:22.485 --> 51:24.985
This is a warrant for a complete
search of your company's records,

51:24.987 --> 51:26.487
starting with your lab.

51:26.489 --> 51:28.324
Of course. Follow me.

51:33.063 --> 51:36.197
We are horrified that what's happening
out there originated in this lab,

51:36.199 --> 51:38.501
and we will do anything we
can to help.

51:38.503 --> 51:40.802
Good, we need access to
everything.

51:40.804 --> 51:43.471
Absolutely.
You have our full cooperation.

51:43.473 --> 51:44.806
Every file.

51:44.808 --> 51:48.208
Hard drives and servers, too.
Let's go.

51:48.210 --> 51:50.145
Step away from
your work station, sir.

51:50.147 --> 51:52.548
Could you open that up?
Keep yourself logged in.

51:52.550 --> 51:54.349
Step back.

51:54.351 --> 51:56.483
To that end, Agent Park, we're
going through the files

51:56.485 --> 51:59.655
of the scientist responsible for
these creatures, Dr. Kate Caldwell.

51:59.657 --> 52:02.422
I'm sure you're aware
of her criminal record.

52:02.424 --> 52:04.526
Unfortunately,
we're just now uncovering

52:04.528 --> 52:07.728
all the horrible things she was
doing during her time here.

52:07.730 --> 52:09.664
I'll need that list of
Energyne servers, ASAP.

52:09.666 --> 52:10.934
Of course, sir.

52:18.208 --> 52:19.210
You okay?

52:20.577 --> 52:23.076
Because you're sweating.
A lot.

52:23.078 --> 52:24.344
No, I'm fine.

52:24.346 --> 52:26.282
Everything's fine.

52:28.686 --> 52:31.186
Whiskey-Two-Tango,
Whiskey-Two-Tango,

52:31.188 --> 52:34.622
this is Echo-Four-Romeo, over.

52:34.624 --> 52:37.791
<i>Whiskey-Two-Tango,
Whiskey-Two-Tango,</i>

52:37.793 --> 52:40.295
<i>this is Echo-Four-Romeo.</i>

52:40.297 --> 52:42.733
So, what do we do now?

52:45.067 --> 52:46.867
I'm sorry, Doc.

52:46.869 --> 52:48.869
There's no "we" anymore.

52:48.871 --> 52:52.739
Look, I am sorry
I lied to you.

52:52.741 --> 52:54.642
Yeah, save it.

52:54.644 --> 52:57.244
You wanted something, you lied to get it.
You're human.

52:57.246 --> 52:59.449
What makes you dislike
people so much?

53:05.255 --> 53:07.087
Let me tell you something.

53:07.089 --> 53:09.891
I've fought in wars all
over the world.

53:09.893 --> 53:14.161
Hunted down animal poachers,
Africa, India, South America.

53:14.163 --> 53:17.465
I got to see how people
really are.

53:17.467 --> 53:20.003
And they'll pretty much do
anything to get what they want.

53:21.737 --> 53:23.741
You think we're all like that?

53:25.741 --> 53:27.645
You know where I found George?

53:29.613 --> 53:31.948
<i>He was hiding underneath
the poacher's truck.</i>

53:34.584 --> 53:36.651
<i>When my team arrived,</i>

53:36.653 --> 53:40.588
<i>these bastards were in the
middle of butchering his mother.</i>

53:40.590 --> 53:45.092
<i>They were cutting off her hands so
they could sell them as ashtrays.</i>

53:45.094 --> 53:47.295
<i>George never would've survived
on his own.</i>

53:47.297 --> 53:50.367
<i>An albino like that on the black
market is worth a fortune.</i>

53:51.669 --> 53:53.470
So I took him with me.

53:56.438 --> 53:58.208
And what happened
to the poachers?

53:59.677 --> 54:02.980
Well, they shot at us
and they missed.

54:03.779 --> 54:05.315
I shot back.

54:06.049 --> 54:07.184
I didn't.

54:34.512 --> 54:38.081
It's a good thing George doesn't
feel the same way about people.

54:40.150 --> 54:42.584
What's that supposed to mean?

54:42.586 --> 54:44.687
Oh. After what happened
to his family,

54:44.689 --> 54:47.358
it feels like it would be real
easy for him not to trust humans,

54:49.025 --> 54:50.927
but he definitely trusts you.

54:52.429 --> 54:54.395
Right?

54:54.397 --> 54:56.931
You're a geneticist,
you're not a shrink.

54:56.933 --> 55:01.201
I also have a Ph.D. in calling
people on their shit.

55:01.203 --> 55:04.237
Ah, well.
This ought to be good then.

55:04.239 --> 55:07.741
Look, after college,
I was using CRISPR

55:07.743 --> 55:10.079
to help endangered species
in the Arctic.

55:11.281 --> 55:14.181
Then my brother got sick.

55:14.183 --> 55:17.184
Doctors told him he didn't
have much of a chance.

55:17.186 --> 55:18.889
But I knew CRISPR
could save him.

55:20.089 --> 55:23.559
Then Claire Wyden showed up.

55:23.561 --> 55:26.893
She made me her lead
genetic researcher.

55:26.895 --> 55:29.564
- So Energyne recruited you?
- Yeah.

55:29.566 --> 55:31.600
But what I didn't
know was that

55:31.602 --> 55:33.467
every time I'd make a breakthrough
that could help my brother,

55:33.469 --> 55:36.239
they were secretly using it
to build weaponized DNA.

55:38.808 --> 55:40.777
I tried to destroy it.

55:42.411 --> 55:45.148
Security just got to me
before I could finish the job.

55:47.817 --> 55:50.586
Anyway, uh,

55:50.588 --> 55:53.791
a month after I went
to prison, my brother died.

55:58.161 --> 56:00.496
I never even got to say
goodbye.

56:03.967 --> 56:05.235
I'm sorry.

56:06.637 --> 56:08.469
I just wanna make sure

56:08.471 --> 56:12.109
the Wydens can't hurt anyone
or anything ever again.

56:14.344 --> 56:16.013
Does that sound like a plan?

56:18.147 --> 56:19.583
Sounds like a plan.

56:26.188 --> 56:28.424
Looks like our ride's here.

56:39.469 --> 56:42.039
<i>...Captain Evans.</i>

56:45.642 --> 56:47.542
<i>Copy that.
Set a perimeter.</i>

56:52.014 --> 56:54.282
Colonel Blake, sir.

56:54.284 --> 56:56.651
<i>Black-Dog-Six-Actual, we have
eyes on targets Alpha and Bravo.</i>

56:56.653 --> 56:59.720
Roger that. Get in
position to box them in.

56:59.722 --> 57:01.322
<i>Roger, Six-Actual.</i>

57:01.324 --> 57:03.224
<i>Targets are eight klicks out
and moving fast.</i>

57:03.226 --> 57:04.828
George is with the wolf?

57:06.462 --> 57:08.029
You've engaged the
gorilla, sir?

57:08.031 --> 57:09.996
And the wolf.

57:09.998 --> 57:12.300
Got them surrounded in a quarry
about 30 miles outside Chicago.

57:12.302 --> 57:15.837
Their trajectories had them both going
in a straight line to the city.

57:15.839 --> 57:18.338
Two different species making a
coordinated long-distance journey.

57:18.340 --> 57:19.739
That just doesn't happen.

57:19.741 --> 57:20.907
Excuse me. Who is this?

57:20.909 --> 57:22.844
Colonel, this is Davis Okoye.

57:22.846 --> 57:25.346
He's a primatologist.
He raised the gorilla there.

57:25.348 --> 57:28.181
And that is Dr. Caldwell.
She worked for Energyne.

57:28.183 --> 57:30.418
She helped cook up
our cuddly little friends.

57:30.420 --> 57:32.353
Agent Russell, this is a
military operation.

57:32.355 --> 57:36.023
Yes, sir. I understand that, sir.
But right now,

57:36.025 --> 57:39.259
these two know more about these
creatures than anyone on this planet.

57:39.261 --> 57:42.096
I think you need to hear
what they have to say.

57:42.098 --> 57:44.398
<i>Colonel, what everybody
has to understand is</i>

57:44.400 --> 57:46.900
this is no longer just a wolf
and a gorilla.

57:46.902 --> 57:49.103
A wolf and a gorilla would
be attacking each other.

57:49.105 --> 57:52.239
They wouldn't be traveling in a
straight line to the same destination.

57:52.241 --> 57:54.342
Then what are they doing and
why are they going to Chicago?

57:54.344 --> 57:56.344
Because they're being called.

57:56.346 --> 57:59.179
When I was at Energyne,
we worked with bat DNA.

57:59.181 --> 58:02.551
The Wydens were obsessed with
developing biosonar communication,

58:02.553 --> 58:05.186
<i>and it looks like they got it
to work.</i>

58:05.188 --> 58:08.624
Energyne must be emitting some
kind of signal to draw them there.

58:08.626 --> 58:11.291
Those creatures will do
anything

58:11.293 --> 58:14.728
to get to that signal and
make it stop.

58:14.730 --> 58:17.098
Colonel, you have to
evacuate Chicago.

58:17.100 --> 58:19.099
These creatures are engineered
to regenerate.

58:19.101 --> 58:20.768
<i>Bullets and tanks
are not gonna stop them.</i>

58:20.770 --> 58:23.575
We have our contingencies
in order, Mr. Okoye.

58:24.541 --> 58:25.775
Colonel.

58:29.478 --> 58:33.213
In the meantime, the FBI has
requested that you remain here.

58:33.215 --> 58:35.416
They have a few questions
of their own.

58:35.418 --> 58:36.918
These gentlemen will
see you out.

58:36.920 --> 58:38.121
- Ma'am, let's go.
- Come on.

58:39.557 --> 58:41.054
You're making a big
mistake, Colonel.

58:41.056 --> 58:43.491
Sir, let's go.

58:43.493 --> 58:46.159
<i>Targets in circle. All
Bushmasters, targets in three kill zone.</i>

58:46.161 --> 58:48.161
<i>Hold fire till playtime.</i>

58:48.163 --> 58:50.566
<i>Black-Dog-Six-Actual, we
have the targets surrounded.</i>

58:50.568 --> 58:53.635
<i>Ambush is set.
All Bushmasters standing by.</i>

58:53.637 --> 58:55.005
Prepare to engage.

58:59.942 --> 59:03.514
This operation is gonna go south fast.
We have to get to Chicago.

59:05.447 --> 59:07.949
Yeah, I'm working on it.

59:07.951 --> 59:10.317
All right, you two. We're in
the transport to the left.

59:10.319 --> 59:12.488
- Kate, come on, come on.
- Hey! Hey!

59:13.255 --> 59:14.689
Hey, I said left.

59:14.691 --> 59:16.290
Okay. Hold on a second, boys.

59:16.292 --> 59:18.425
You look like very smart MPs.

59:18.427 --> 59:20.927
You also know there's a lot of bad
shit that's going on right now.

59:20.929 --> 59:22.530
And I gotta be honest with
you both,

59:22.532 --> 59:25.333
this stuff that we're doing?
It's not working for me.

59:25.335 --> 59:27.134
- Enough. Move!
- Okay, all right.

59:27.136 --> 59:28.604
Just consider this.

59:28.606 --> 59:30.770
I'm a former team guy.
Let's not do this thing,

59:30.772 --> 59:32.840
where you get in my face,
you threaten me,

59:32.842 --> 59:34.808
because I'm gonna have
to knock you out,

59:34.810 --> 59:36.678
and then, you, look at me. I'm
gonna choke you out so bad,

59:36.680 --> 59:39.513
you're gonna urinate yourself,
and in front of the lady.

59:39.515 --> 59:41.815
- It's not a good look.
- It wasn't a goddamn request!

59:41.817 --> 59:43.486
- Let's go!
- Hey!

59:49.292 --> 59:52.192
This is exactly what I
didn't want to happen.

59:52.194 --> 59:54.462
That's a big arm.
Don't fight it.

59:54.464 --> 59:56.364
Don't fight it.

59:56.366 --> 59:58.735
There you go. Sleepy time.

01:00:03.206 --> 01:00:05.038
That's the plan you
were working on?

01:00:05.040 --> 01:00:07.174
Well, I didn't kill them.

01:00:12.815 --> 01:00:14.415
So what are we looking for?

01:00:14.417 --> 01:00:16.416
<i>We're looking
for a helicopter,</i>

01:00:16.418 --> 01:00:18.386
<i>but preferably one that's not
surrounded by military personnel.</i>

01:00:18.388 --> 01:00:20.891
They probably have a grounded
medevac chopper at the hospital.

01:00:24.695 --> 01:00:26.730
And that's why you always
bring a doctor.

01:00:52.555 --> 01:00:53.857
Good job, Doc.

01:00:59.530 --> 01:01:01.962
<i>Well, well, well, looky here.</i>

01:01:01.964 --> 01:01:04.264
Stealing the hospital
whirlybird.

01:01:04.266 --> 01:01:06.099
Color me impressed.

01:01:06.101 --> 01:01:08.402
That is creative.

01:01:08.404 --> 01:01:10.571
Come on. You already saw
what George did to our plane.

01:01:10.573 --> 01:01:13.074
You know everyone's
underestimating these animals.

01:01:13.076 --> 01:01:15.076
But you two have the magic
bullet?

01:01:15.078 --> 01:01:16.444
We think we know
where to find it.

01:01:16.446 --> 01:01:18.613
Listen,

01:01:18.615 --> 01:01:20.748
Claire Wyden is way too smart to
create a weapon she can't control.

01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:24.117
They must have an antidote at
Energyne that can halt the mutations.

01:01:24.119 --> 01:01:26.420
If we get our hands on it,
it could be our only shot

01:01:26.422 --> 01:01:28.792
to stop George and the wolf
before they level Chicago.

01:01:33.962 --> 01:01:36.463
You know, this ain't
no truck stop, <i>amigo.</i>

01:01:36.465 --> 01:01:38.902
They don't just leave keys
under the visor.

01:01:39.935 --> 01:01:42.235
Wait, you're helping us?

01:01:42.237 --> 01:01:46.005
You saved my life. I reckon
it's the least I can do.

01:01:46.007 --> 01:01:48.074
<i>We're on the same page
when it comes to the Wydens.</i>

01:01:48.076 --> 01:01:51.177
They think they're
above the law.

01:01:51.179 --> 01:01:53.246
And I wanna remind them
that they ain't.

01:01:53.248 --> 01:01:56.916
So yes, we are helping
each other.

01:01:56.918 --> 01:01:58.154
Do what you do.

01:01:59.422 --> 01:02:00.824
I'll be in touch.

01:02:01.924 --> 01:02:03.324
<i>Wow.</i>

01:02:03.326 --> 01:02:05.358
That went way better
than I thought it would.

01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.427
Yeah, it did. I was hoping I could
knock him out, too, though.

01:02:07.429 --> 01:02:09.963
You know there are other ways
of dealing with people, right?

01:02:09.965 --> 01:02:12.101
I do know that, yeah, but
that's no fun.

01:02:14.637 --> 01:02:16.205
I assume you know how to
fly this thing.

01:02:18.709 --> 01:02:20.110
Absolutely.

01:02:25.982 --> 01:02:27.782
It's coming back to me.

01:02:27.784 --> 01:02:30.119
It's all coming back,
right now.

01:02:31.622 --> 01:02:33.353
Yeah.

01:02:33.355 --> 01:02:38.324
It's coming back.
It's coming back.

01:02:38.326 --> 01:02:42.228
<i>Sir, we are 15 minutes from
sunrise. Call for fire to follow, over.</i>

01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:45.271
<i>We have the targets.
Serpents are in position. It's playtime.</i>

01:02:46.969 --> 01:02:49.402
Get the FLIR footage onscreen.

01:02:49.404 --> 01:02:51.506
<i>FLIR is up.</i>

01:02:51.508 --> 01:02:52.473
<i>This is Three-Six.
Targets in the open, over.</i>

01:02:52.475 --> 01:02:53.642
Clear to fire.

01:02:53.644 --> 01:02:55.045
<i>Shot out.</i>

01:03:01.183 --> 01:03:03.750
<i>Good hit. Stand by for BDA.</i>

01:03:03.752 --> 01:03:05.319
Confirm EKIA.

01:03:05.321 --> 01:03:07.855
<i>Six-Alpha-Lobo X-ray.
Confirm EKIA. Over.</i>

01:03:07.857 --> 01:03:09.757
<i>Roger, Lobo. Stand by.</i>

01:03:09.759 --> 01:03:11.528
Two-six, stay on overwatch.

01:03:13.228 --> 01:03:15.898
Echo-Zero-two,
moving to phase line gold.

01:03:17.433 --> 01:03:18.566
Jesus!

01:03:18.568 --> 01:03:21.434
Come on, come on.

01:03:21.436 --> 01:03:23.938
<i>Six-Alpha-Lobo X-ray.
Sitrep, over.</i>

01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:25.673
Negative EKIA.

01:03:25.675 --> 01:03:28.775
They must have moved, sir.
I say again, we no longer...

01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:33.380
Jesus Christ!

01:03:33.382 --> 01:03:35.553
<i>They're on our east and west flanks!
Everybody move!</i>

01:03:39.622 --> 01:03:40.724
<i>Nothing's working!</i>

01:03:43.759 --> 01:03:47.030
Bushmaster-Six-Alpha, this is Lobo X-ray.
Need a sitrep, over.

01:03:47.897 --> 01:03:49.099
Captain Evans?

01:03:54.904 --> 01:03:58.471
Kaplan, inform the National Guard we're
moving forward with the contingency plan.

01:03:58.473 --> 01:04:00.474
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

01:04:00.476 --> 01:04:02.942
I want ground artillery rolling
into downtown Chicago, ASAP!

01:04:02.944 --> 01:04:04.978
This time, we throw everything
we can at these things,

01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:07.380
and get people the hell out
of that city!

01:04:07.382 --> 01:04:10.116
<i>I want blockades at every
quarter mile south of the Loop!</i>

01:04:10.118 --> 01:04:12.152
<i>We evacuate
civilians to the north!</i>

01:04:12.154 --> 01:04:15.557
It's me. They are
evacuating Chicago.

01:04:15.559 --> 01:04:18.157
<i>George and the wolf went
right through Blake's men.</i>

01:04:18.159 --> 01:04:20.927
<i>Okoye, they are out in
front of you.</i>

01:04:20.929 --> 01:04:22.065
Copy that.

01:04:26.268 --> 01:04:28.335
What is it?

01:04:28.337 --> 01:04:30.578
They're never gonna get everyone
out of the city in time.

01:05:02.506 --> 01:05:03.641
Davis!

01:05:22.857 --> 01:05:24.391
<i>Two-Three,
targets in the open.</i>

01:05:24.393 --> 01:05:26.226
<i>Roger. You are clear and hot.</i>

01:05:26.228 --> 01:05:28.962
<i>Roger. Weapons free.
I'm engaging now.</i>

01:05:28.964 --> 01:05:30.664
<i>Jesus!
I'm hit! I'm hit!</i>

01:05:30.666 --> 01:05:32.366
<i>Bird down! Bird down!</i>

01:05:32.368 --> 01:05:34.569
<i>To hell with that,
I'm taking these things out.</i>

01:05:34.804 --> 01:05:36.306
<i>I have no control!</i>

01:05:45.047 --> 01:05:47.167
<i>Two-Nine firing, target hit.
Lighting him up.</i>

01:05:52.253 --> 01:05:53.753
<i>He hit me with something!</i>

01:05:53.755 --> 01:05:55.054
<i>Lost tail rudders!</i>

01:05:55.056 --> 01:05:57.060
<i>Mayday! Mayday!
I'm going down!</i>

01:06:03.898 --> 01:06:06.199
Status report.
Where is Warthog One?

01:06:06.201 --> 01:06:08.434
Inbound, sir.

01:06:08.436 --> 01:06:11.277
<i>- Warthog One, you are cleared hot.
- Roger that.</i>

01:06:17.913 --> 01:06:19.748
<i>This is Warthog One.
Targets missed.</i>

01:06:22.118 --> 01:06:25.052
<i>Lobo X-ray, request come
back around for another run.</i>

01:06:25.054 --> 01:06:28.255
Warthog One, this is Black-Dog-Six-Actual.
Hit them again.

01:06:28.257 --> 01:06:29.691
<i>Roger that.</i>

01:06:29.693 --> 01:06:31.257
Kaplan, where are we
with the evacuation?

01:06:31.259 --> 01:06:33.695
50% downtown, sir.

01:06:33.697 --> 01:06:36.797
Sir, we have a bogey headed north
in the river, half mile out.

01:06:36.799 --> 01:06:38.702
What the hell are you
talking about?

01:06:45.407 --> 01:06:46.640
Is that a ship?

01:06:46.642 --> 01:06:48.141
It's underwater, sir.

01:06:48.143 --> 01:06:50.479
We don't have any subs
in the area.

01:07:08.063 --> 01:07:10.399
Davis, there's something big
in the river.

01:07:40.295 --> 01:07:42.031
Well, that sucks.

01:07:43.364 --> 01:07:45.032
<i>This is Three-Two.</i>

01:07:45.034 --> 01:07:46.467
<i>We have enemy contact in the river!
How copy?</i>

01:07:46.469 --> 01:07:48.201
<i>Say again, Three-Two?</i>

01:07:48.203 --> 01:07:50.003
<i>Enemy contact!
Target is heading east!</i>

01:07:50.005 --> 01:07:51.771
<i>Copy, Three-Two.
Call for fire to follow.</i>

01:07:51.773 --> 01:07:53.172
1 <i>Negative, negative!
Danger close!</i>

01:07:53.174 --> 01:07:54.440
<i>Copy, Three-Two.</i>

01:07:54.442 --> 01:07:57.212
Direct all forces at that
thing now!

01:07:58.848 --> 01:08:01.815
<i>Enemy contact!
Three o'clock! Engage!</i>

01:08:01.817 --> 01:08:03.684
Flank him!

01:08:03.686 --> 01:08:04.951
Everything you've got!

01:08:04.953 --> 01:08:06.320
Aim for the gills!

01:08:06.322 --> 01:08:07.625
Fire!

01:08:32.846 --> 01:08:34.551
Fire! Fire! Fire!

01:08:53.102 --> 01:08:54.502
<i>They can't stop them.</i>

01:08:54.504 --> 01:08:56.171
We gotta get that antidote.

01:09:12.854 --> 01:09:14.622
<i>Alpha-Six-Actual,
we can't hold them!</i>

01:09:14.624 --> 01:09:16.256
<i>I've lost half my men!
We're backing out!</i>

01:09:16.258 --> 01:09:18.225
Are we evacuated downtown?

01:09:18.227 --> 01:09:20.560
Clear at a 10-block radius from
Upper Wacker to Adams, sir.

01:09:20.563 --> 01:09:22.028
Prep the MOABs.

01:09:22.029 --> 01:09:23.232
Roger that.

01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:36.408
Colonel, you are about to drop the largest
conventional bomb in the arsenal,

01:09:36.411 --> 01:09:38.444
on US soil.

01:09:38.446 --> 01:09:41.747
With all due respect, sir, there
has got to be another way.

01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:43.551
You drop that bomb,

01:09:43.553 --> 01:09:46.987
not only do you wipe out
half a city,

01:09:46.988 --> 01:09:49.055
but you'd destroy any
evidence.

01:09:49.057 --> 01:09:52.059
See, I got a team on the way to
Energyne to secure the antidote.

01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:56.631
So if you could divert some
resources and support them...

01:09:56.633 --> 01:09:59.765
Is this the same team that
stole my medevac chopper?

01:09:59.767 --> 01:10:01.502
Davis Okoye
and Dr. Caldwell...

01:10:01.504 --> 01:10:03.570
Need to get the hell
out of there.

01:10:03.572 --> 01:10:06.405
And I need you to drop
the cowboy bullshit,

01:10:06.407 --> 01:10:08.111
and get with the program.

01:10:11.413 --> 01:10:13.145
Well, sir,

01:10:13.147 --> 01:10:15.148
you know us cowboys.

01:10:15.150 --> 01:10:18.851
We just can't stand
leaving our friends behind.

01:10:18.853 --> 01:10:21.588
Get your ass out of here!

01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:25.328
Finally, an order of yours
I can agree with.

01:10:30.999 --> 01:10:33.035
Let's bring up a feed
on our stealth bombers.

01:10:35.771 --> 01:10:38.337
Bomber feed is up.

01:10:38.339 --> 01:10:41.676
<i>Viper Two-Five, you've been
released for mission execution, time now.</i>

01:10:41.678 --> 01:10:43.711
<i>Holding
short, runway two-five.</i>

01:10:43.713 --> 01:10:45.546
<i>Cleared for
take-off, runway two-five.</i>

01:10:45.548 --> 01:10:47.180
<i>Cleared for take-off,
two-five.</i>

01:10:47.182 --> 01:10:49.815
<i>Roger. Good luck.</i>

01:10:49.817 --> 01:10:52.686
<i>Lobo X-ray, this is
Viper Two-Five.</i>

01:10:52.688 --> 01:10:54.721
<i>Package is airborne.</i>

01:10:54.723 --> 01:10:57.823
<i>We are inbound.</i>

01:10:57.825 --> 01:11:00.726
Agent Russell, here's the
information you requested.

01:11:00.728 --> 01:11:03.497
That's the FBI's list
for Energyne's servers.

01:11:03.499 --> 01:11:04.965
You were right.

01:11:04.967 --> 01:11:06.966
There's one server that
they left off.

01:11:06.968 --> 01:11:09.071
And there's only two people
that have access to it.

01:11:11.039 --> 01:11:15.543
Brett and Claire,
you sneaky sons of bitches.

01:11:15.545 --> 01:11:17.313
- Thank you, son.
- Yes, sir.

01:11:21.182 --> 01:11:23.720
It's Russell. I need a ride.

01:11:25.722 --> 01:11:27.991
Come on, this way, this way!
Keep moving!

01:11:35.931 --> 01:11:38.000
- Where to?
- Eighty-fifth floor.

01:11:46.107 --> 01:11:47.243
Lab's in here.

01:11:48.076 --> 01:11:49.842
Damn it!

01:11:51.548 --> 01:11:53.180
Hey, give me some good news.

01:11:53.182 --> 01:11:55.550
MOABs are 30 minutes out,
give or take.

01:11:55.552 --> 01:11:57.685
<i>Just one could take out
five city blocks.</i>

01:11:57.687 --> 01:11:59.019
<i>You better move!</i>

01:11:59.021 --> 01:12:01.020
I'm never taking your
call again.

01:12:01.022 --> 01:12:03.390
It's locked. What'd he say?

01:12:03.392 --> 01:12:06.513
Uh, something about the mother of all
bombs is on its way and we need to hurry.

01:12:09.932 --> 01:12:11.200
Okay.

01:12:13.936 --> 01:12:15.469
Jeez!

01:12:15.471 --> 01:12:17.541
FBI must've confiscated
all the hard drives.

01:12:18.941 --> 01:12:20.207
All right.

01:12:20.209 --> 01:12:22.546
Come on, Kate, think.

01:12:23.745 --> 01:12:24.980
Here we go.

01:12:27.782 --> 01:12:31.752
Okay, everything in the lab
is on one system.

01:12:31.754 --> 01:12:34.988
The FBI would never have thought
to confiscate a thermostat,

01:12:34.990 --> 01:12:36.823
but there's a backdoor into
the server.

01:12:36.825 --> 01:12:39.393
So we should be able to access
every file

01:12:39.395 --> 01:12:41.228
from here.

01:12:41.230 --> 01:12:44.264
<i>Okay. Change of plan.
The military's lost control.</i>

01:12:44.266 --> 01:12:45.931
We're coming up.

01:12:45.933 --> 01:12:47.266
All right.

01:12:47.268 --> 01:12:49.769
The chopper is ready.

01:12:49.771 --> 01:12:52.773
I have got your rat.

01:12:52.775 --> 01:12:56.275
Let's get the R-19 from the
lab so we have some leverage

01:12:56.277 --> 01:12:58.947
when this shitstorm
finally catches up with us.

01:12:59.781 --> 01:13:01.280
Now what?

01:13:01.282 --> 01:13:02.451
We have visitors.

01:13:05.087 --> 01:13:07.319
- I don't believe this.
- What's wrong?

01:13:07.321 --> 01:13:09.155
The system has been
totally scrubbed.

01:13:09.157 --> 01:13:11.824
They erased everything
connected to the project.

01:13:11.826 --> 01:13:13.694
But it's here.

01:13:13.696 --> 01:13:15.465
We just have to find it.

01:13:16.298 --> 01:13:17.501
In there!

01:13:20.968 --> 01:13:22.270
I got this.

01:13:29.512 --> 01:13:30.812
I like it.

01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:33.113
What are we looking for?

01:13:33.115 --> 01:13:35.314
Anything that starts
with "RPG."

01:13:35.316 --> 01:13:37.451
It'll be in one of these
cryopreserve trays.

01:13:37.453 --> 01:13:38.885
Got it.

01:13:38.887 --> 01:13:40.490
RPG, RPG.

01:13:42.958 --> 01:13:44.326
I think I found it.

01:13:54.069 --> 01:13:55.237
This is it.

01:13:56.737 --> 01:13:58.638
Is that the cure?

01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:00.974
Not a cure exactly.

01:14:00.976 --> 01:14:04.310
R-19 doesn't revert them
to their normal size.

01:14:04.312 --> 01:14:06.481
It just overrides
their unchecked aggression.

01:14:09.418 --> 01:14:11.150
Nice to see you, Kate.

01:14:11.152 --> 01:14:12.754
Go to hell, Claire.

01:14:14.255 --> 01:14:17.527
I was so sorry
to hear about your brother.

01:14:25.334 --> 01:14:27.571
Now, why don't you hand
those over?

01:14:40.549 --> 01:14:42.882
All right, let's go.

01:14:42.884 --> 01:14:44.454
That's not happening.

01:14:46.688 --> 01:14:48.458
Can I see that, please?

01:14:56.097 --> 01:14:57.232
Davis.

01:15:00.702 --> 01:15:01.801
That happened.

01:15:01.803 --> 01:15:03.068
Davis.

01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:04.439
Now, let's go.

01:15:06.275 --> 01:15:08.311
- Oh, my God!
- Now.

01:15:18.588 --> 01:15:19.955
They're here.

01:15:50.785 --> 01:15:51.786
Move!

01:15:54.455 --> 01:15:57.656
I was actually starting to worry about how
we were gonna reengineer the pathogen.

01:15:58.628 --> 01:16:00.460
Then you showed up.

01:16:00.462 --> 01:16:02.599
Now, get in unless you wanna
end up like your friend.

01:16:20.848 --> 01:16:22.884
Brett! Get back here!

01:16:33.361 --> 01:16:34.496
No!

01:16:43.338 --> 01:16:44.340
Come on.

01:16:53.181 --> 01:16:54.649
I thought you were dead!

01:16:54.651 --> 01:16:56.216
Well, I think she missed
all the vital organs,

01:16:56.218 --> 01:16:57.651
but don't jinx it.

01:16:57.653 --> 01:16:59.219
Now, let's get that
antidote. Come on!

01:16:59.221 --> 01:17:00.755
Davis, wait.

01:17:01.822 --> 01:17:03.258
I have one.

01:17:04.559 --> 01:17:06.493
Okay, new plan.

01:17:06.495 --> 01:17:07.860
We give it to George and maybe he
can help us stop the other two.

01:17:07.862 --> 01:17:08.998
Okay.

01:17:14.201 --> 01:17:17.042
Now, we just have to figure out how
the hell we're gonna give it to him.

01:17:18.874 --> 01:17:20.242
We gotta move!

01:17:26.616 --> 01:17:30.015
You know, I'm actually glad
you're both still alive.

01:17:30.017 --> 01:17:31.384
Now, you can go up there
and distract your friend

01:17:31.386 --> 01:17:32.888
while I get the hell
out of here!

01:17:34.691 --> 01:17:36.726
Or I could kill you both now!

01:17:43.197 --> 01:17:44.432
Okay.

01:17:45.601 --> 01:17:47.035
I'll go.

01:17:50.938 --> 01:17:52.107
George!

01:17:54.308 --> 01:17:57.243
Get away from me!
Get your hands off me!

01:17:57.245 --> 01:17:59.248
What the hell are you doing?

01:18:01.282 --> 01:18:03.084
Feeding the monster to
the gorilla!

01:18:12.994 --> 01:18:15.264
Oh, shit!

01:18:21.637 --> 01:18:22.902
What?

01:18:22.904 --> 01:18:25.104
No, forget my sister!

01:18:25.106 --> 01:18:26.905
She lost her goddamn mind!

01:18:26.907 --> 01:18:29.911
You just get an SUV over here!
You get me out of here now!

01:18:32.347 --> 01:18:33.649
Damn, son!

01:18:35.617 --> 01:18:38.984
Did you just run down
80 flights of stairs?

01:18:38.986 --> 01:18:41.019
Who the hell are you?

01:18:41.021 --> 01:18:43.591
I'm the fella that was gonna run
up those stairs to arrest you.

01:18:43.593 --> 01:18:45.158
But, shit,

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:47.863
you look so terrible
I feel kind of bad about it.

01:18:51.932 --> 01:18:53.501
I'll tell you what.

01:18:53.503 --> 01:18:56.636
Since you're working so hard
to get out of here,

01:18:56.638 --> 01:18:59.606
I'm guessing you got a laptop
in that bag there.

01:18:59.608 --> 01:19:02.274
You give it to me and you
can just get.

01:19:02.276 --> 01:19:04.310
Right out that door.

01:19:04.312 --> 01:19:06.713
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:19:06.715 --> 01:19:08.984
You just hand it over
and be on your way.

01:19:12.120 --> 01:19:14.186
Okay!

01:19:14.188 --> 01:19:16.221
It's really my sister
who did all this.

01:19:16.223 --> 01:19:17.724
This wasn't even my idea.

01:19:17.726 --> 01:19:19.859
Since when is
complicity a crime?

01:19:19.861 --> 01:19:21.662
Exactly.

01:19:21.664 --> 01:19:24.296
- See you, Tex!
- Hey!

01:19:24.298 --> 01:19:26.259
Why don't you leave the
little fella here with me?

01:19:28.035 --> 01:19:30.706
That's my pleasure.
I hate that thing!

01:19:40.848 --> 01:19:42.047
Oh.

01:19:42.049 --> 01:19:43.750
Damn.

01:19:43.752 --> 01:19:45.254
That was a lot.

01:19:49.191 --> 01:19:51.491
Boy, I hope y'all have
a plan up there.

01:19:51.493 --> 01:19:54.897
What do you say, little fella?
Let's you and I take another exit.

01:20:15.282 --> 01:20:17.717
When does the antidote
kick in?

01:20:17.719 --> 01:20:20.019
Ten minutes, maybe.

01:20:20.021 --> 01:20:22.191
This building is not gonna
be standing in 10 minutes!

01:20:29.763 --> 01:20:31.535
How the hell do we get
off this roof?

01:20:36.070 --> 01:20:37.769
Maybe we don't have
to get off the roof at all.

01:20:37.771 --> 01:20:38.773
What?

01:20:43.044 --> 01:20:45.478
No, we definitely do!

01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:46.616
Come on, come on!

01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:50.783
Davis!

01:20:50.785 --> 01:20:52.619
There's no tail on this
helicopter!

01:20:52.621 --> 01:20:53.886
That's right. We don't
need one.

01:20:53.888 --> 01:20:55.387
You do, if you wanna fly!

01:20:55.389 --> 01:20:57.557
We're not gonna fly,
we're gonna crash.

01:20:57.559 --> 01:20:58.594
What?

01:21:02.631 --> 01:21:04.930
Okay...

01:21:04.932 --> 01:21:07.065
We just need to get enough lift to stay
on top of the building as it falls.

01:21:07.067 --> 01:21:08.736
You know,
just like riding an avalanche.

01:21:09.638 --> 01:21:11.005
No, I don't know!

01:21:20.683 --> 01:21:22.418
Come on, baby!
Here we go.

01:21:39.467 --> 01:21:40.700
Oh, my God!

01:21:40.702 --> 01:21:42.036
This could get ugly.

01:21:47.875 --> 01:21:49.943
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

01:21:49.945 --> 01:21:50.946
Oh, Jesus!

01:21:53.648 --> 01:21:55.851
Oh, my God!

01:22:02.958 --> 01:22:04.960
Hold on, Kate!

01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:14.469
Brace!

01:23:02.182 --> 01:23:03.552
I got you.

01:23:15.129 --> 01:23:16.633
I need a drink.

01:23:28.643 --> 01:23:30.646
I can't believe we
survived that.

01:23:33.882 --> 01:23:35.982
Wait, there's still
people here.

01:23:35.984 --> 01:23:38.120
We need to call off the airstrike.
Come on.

01:23:52.668 --> 01:23:53.936
Davis.

01:23:55.504 --> 01:23:56.804
I know.

01:24:03.512 --> 01:24:04.647
George?

01:24:06.981 --> 01:24:08.183
You okay?

01:24:20.528 --> 01:24:21.763
Thank God.

01:24:23.263 --> 01:24:25.133
Good to have you back, buddy.

01:24:30.038 --> 01:24:31.674
Oh, I look like shit?

01:24:32.307 --> 01:24:33.673
<i>Okay.</i>

01:24:33.675 --> 01:24:36.978
You look like big shit!

01:24:55.963 --> 01:24:57.198
Come on.

01:25:02.169 --> 01:25:04.369
<i>Lobo X-ray, this is
Viper Two-Five.</i>

01:25:04.371 --> 01:25:06.204
<i>Escorts are in position. We are
eight minutes from target.</i>

01:25:06.206 --> 01:25:08.006
<i>Over.</i>

01:25:08.008 --> 01:25:09.510
<i>Roger, Two-Five.
Call for fire to follow.</i>

01:25:09.512 --> 01:25:11.013
<i>- Over.
- Copy that.</i>

01:25:12.813 --> 01:25:14.415
Let's go! Let's go!

01:25:16.417 --> 01:25:18.083
What's the plan?

01:25:18.085 --> 01:25:20.418
I want you to take this Humvee
and find a sat phone.

01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:23.189
And get a hold of Russell. He's our only
shot at calling off this airstrike.

01:25:23.191 --> 01:25:26.091
Then let him know there's still military
personnel and civilians on the ground.

01:25:26.093 --> 01:25:27.593
George and I will handle
the other two.

01:25:27.595 --> 01:25:29.362
- Davis?
- Yeah?

01:25:29.364 --> 01:25:31.701
Try not to get killed, okay?

01:25:32.668 --> 01:25:33.936
Come on, get going.

01:25:43.911 --> 01:25:46.912
All right, George. We gotta stop these
things before they destroy the city.

01:25:48.782 --> 01:25:51.453
That's right.
Let's kick some ass.

01:26:09.971 --> 01:26:11.272
Oh, shit!

01:26:33.661 --> 01:26:35.797
Of course the wolf flies.

01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:55.280
Hey!
Come and get me,

01:26:55.282 --> 01:26:57.285
you ugly son of a bitch!

01:27:04.926 --> 01:27:05.928
That's it!

01:27:28.383 --> 01:27:30.216
Help! I need a satellite
phone!

01:27:30.218 --> 01:27:31.884
It's not safe here, ma'am.
We need to go now.

01:27:31.886 --> 01:27:33.152
You two, get her on the truck.

01:27:33.154 --> 01:27:35.954
Wait! There's a way to
stop this!

01:27:35.956 --> 01:27:37.122
Fellas.

01:27:37.124 --> 01:27:38.457
Russell?

01:27:38.459 --> 01:27:40.859
- I will take it from here.
- Yes, sir.

01:27:40.861 --> 01:27:42.695
Take a breath, Doc.

01:27:42.697 --> 01:27:44.063
Tell me what you're
doing here.

01:27:44.065 --> 01:27:45.831
The antidote worked.

01:27:45.833 --> 01:27:47.700
Davis and George are trying
to stop the other two.

01:27:47.702 --> 01:27:50.002
But there's still civilians
and military on the ground.

01:27:50.004 --> 01:27:52.374
We have to call off the
airstrike.

01:27:55.743 --> 01:27:58.978
Son, I'll tell you what.
Let's trade.

01:27:58.980 --> 01:28:00.848
- All right, come on. Let's get.
- Hey. Hey!

01:28:08.356 --> 01:28:10.025
George, go!

01:29:26.767 --> 01:29:29.503
Colonel Blake, it is your
old pal, Agent Russell.

01:29:29.505 --> 01:29:31.103
Listen, about your MOABs.

01:29:31.105 --> 01:29:33.139
Do me a favor, would you,

01:29:33.141 --> 01:29:36.274
<i>and take a gander at Federal
Plaza before you drop them?</i>

01:29:36.276 --> 01:29:38.411
Bring up the drone feed
on Federal Plaza.

01:29:38.413 --> 01:29:39.514
Yes, sir.

01:29:43.250 --> 01:29:44.820
My God.

01:30:42.477 --> 01:30:43.845
Oh, come on.

01:31:00.661 --> 01:31:02.564
George, no!

01:31:05.432 --> 01:31:07.899
<i>This is Viper Two-Five.
Two minutes out.</i>

01:31:07.901 --> 01:31:11.036
<i>Target is locked.
MOABs are armed.</i>

01:31:11.038 --> 01:31:12.406
<i>Doors are opening.</i>

01:31:26.219 --> 01:31:27.886
Run!

01:31:27.888 --> 01:31:29.958
Get up! You gotta move!

01:31:57.418 --> 01:31:59.251
Come on, come on, come on!

01:31:59.253 --> 01:32:00.656
<i>Come on, come on!</i>

01:32:27.616 --> 01:32:29.656
You mess with my friend,
you mess with me, mother...

01:32:44.665 --> 01:32:45.668
Shit!

01:33:58.039 --> 01:33:59.174
George.

01:34:02.611 --> 01:34:03.745
George.

01:34:08.749 --> 01:34:10.519
I'll be damned.

01:34:12.253 --> 01:34:13.555
Abort mission.

01:34:46.954 --> 01:34:48.289
George.

01:34:49.322 --> 01:34:50.726
Hey, buddy.

01:34:59.734 --> 01:35:00.834
We did it.

01:35:03.838 --> 01:35:05.407
We saved the city.

01:35:11.411 --> 01:35:12.514
Yeah.

01:35:13.313 --> 01:35:14.915
You saved me.

01:35:16.750 --> 01:35:18.319
George saved Davis.

01:35:52.687 --> 01:35:53.822
George.

01:35:55.656 --> 01:35:56.790
George!

01:36:45.540 --> 01:36:47.242
I'm so sorry, Davis.

01:36:49.710 --> 01:36:52.578
He saved my life.

01:36:52.580 --> 01:36:54.582
He saved a lot of
people's lives.

01:37:22.877 --> 01:37:23.878
<i>Mommy!</i>

01:37:35.789 --> 01:37:37.125
Yes, he did.

01:37:47.334 --> 01:37:48.770
Did I just see you close
your eye?

01:37:50.638 --> 01:37:52.472
I just saw you open your eye!

01:37:58.513 --> 01:38:00.680
Son of a bitch!

01:38:00.682 --> 01:38:02.247
Pretending to be dead?

01:38:02.249 --> 01:38:04.587
- At a time like this?
- Oh, my God!

01:38:10.456 --> 01:38:11.823
No, no.

01:38:11.825 --> 01:38:13.824
No, it's not funny
and I wasn't crying!

01:38:13.826 --> 01:38:16.193
I wasn't crying, okay? There's
a lot of debris around here!

01:38:16.195 --> 01:38:18.095
Wait, is this like a thing
between you guys?

01:38:18.097 --> 01:38:20.299
This is not a thing between us.
It's a thing with him!

01:38:20.301 --> 01:38:22.803
Because he has a twisted
sense of humor!

01:38:26.707 --> 01:38:30.510
Yes, I guess you could
say that.

01:38:30.512 --> 01:38:33.144
She is part of my troop.

01:38:33.146 --> 01:38:34.979
I mean, we're friends, right?

01:38:34.981 --> 01:38:36.716
Yeah.

01:38:36.718 --> 01:38:38.621
Yes, we're friends.

01:38:42.489 --> 01:38:44.122
No! Come on, dude!

01:38:44.124 --> 01:38:45.957
Have some class, okay?

01:38:45.959 --> 01:38:48.493
I don't know what's gotten into him.
Kate, I'm so sorry.

01:38:48.495 --> 01:38:49.961
George, stop.

01:38:49.963 --> 01:38:51.395
All right, all right, guys.

01:38:51.397 --> 01:38:53.297
Let's go home, okay?

01:38:53.299 --> 01:38:54.733
Dude, that was funny.

01:38:54.735 --> 01:38:56.033
I heard that!

01:38:56.035 --> 01:38:57.903
Shit.

01:38:57.905 --> 01:39:01.038
Thank you for saving the
world.

01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:02.908
Yeah, thanks for calling off
the airstrike.

01:39:02.910 --> 01:39:05.210
Like a wise cowboy
once said,

01:39:05.212 --> 01:39:08.479
us assholes gotta
stick together.

01:39:08.481 --> 01:39:10.516
How about we all help
these people out,

01:39:10.518 --> 01:39:12.651
and then find George
here a new home.

01:39:12.653 --> 01:39:15.186
Where are we gonna put him?

01:39:15.188 --> 01:39:18.256
I can tell you right now, we're
not gonna put him on a plane.

01:39:40.973 --> 01:39:45.978
