WEBVTT

01:44.229 --> 01:45.522
Go ahead!

01:46.106 --> 01:48.024
Try it if you can!

01:49.192 --> 01:53.279
Your former head coach, Sam D'Amato…

01:54.364 --> 01:59.160
created the magnificent
"Peek-a-Boo" fighting style.

01:59.828 --> 02:03.373
Bringing the gloves so close to the
jaw it leaves bite marks,

02:03.456 --> 02:05.416
totally covering the vital areas.

02:06.084 --> 02:10.505
Then by weaving, ducking,
bobbing, and circling,

02:10.588 --> 02:13.258
and moving the upper body
at a dizzying rate,

02:13.341 --> 02:15.385
a near-perfect defense is achieved.

02:15.885 --> 02:18.138
He's a top-class opponent

02:18.221 --> 02:21.141
who has mastered the style
on an instinctual level…

02:23.393 --> 02:26.813
We third-rate amateurs will box him.

02:36.573 --> 02:38.074
This is…

02:43.663 --> 02:44.581
Come on!

02:54.132 --> 02:57.343
What do you think of our
simultaneous one-two-three?

03:01.055 --> 03:03.057
No matter how fast you move,

03:03.558 --> 03:07.103
you can only ever dodge a single punch.

03:07.687 --> 03:11.608
If three punches are thrown
simultaneously, two will land.

03:12.192 --> 03:16.487
Even you will succumb to our third-rate
punches, if they land cleanly.

03:21.451 --> 03:22.368
No…

03:24.954 --> 03:25.872
Alright,

03:25.955 --> 03:27.957
no more boxing!

03:30.084 --> 03:32.587
Stop!

03:37.133 --> 03:39.552
When it comes to techniques
for a woman or child

03:40.386 --> 03:43.139
to defeat a larger man…

03:43.765 --> 03:45.683
the first is going for the testes.

03:45.767 --> 03:48.686
The second is gouging the eyes.

03:49.270 --> 03:51.231
But there is one more killer technique,

03:51.314 --> 03:54.442
if it can even be called a technique.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.070
That is the heel.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.823
Even an elementary-schooler
who barely weighs 30 kilos,

04:00.907 --> 04:04.911
can take out a large
man with a stomp to the face.

04:05.870 --> 04:07.830
It's almost too simple.

04:08.998 --> 04:09.832
Aww…

04:12.418 --> 04:14.545
He was surprisingly weak.

04:14.629 --> 04:17.924
No, more like he was surprisingly
struggling to handle us.

04:23.179 --> 04:24.597
At any rate,

04:24.681 --> 04:29.185
it demonstrates
that an individual's skills

04:29.269 --> 04:31.521
are worthless compared to a team's.

04:32.313 --> 04:35.858
This was a perfect example of that.

04:37.318 --> 04:38.361
Time to finish up.

04:41.906 --> 04:46.160
Shall we sever the tendon
that enables one to make a fist?

04:47.787 --> 04:48.621
Hold him down.

04:49.580 --> 04:50.415
Like this?

04:50.498 --> 04:51.624
Perfect.

04:52.208 --> 04:54.127
Sorry, champ.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.045
It's a simple operation.

04:57.213 --> 04:59.132
It'll be over in no time.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.066
Lip.

05:18.651 --> 05:19.485
There.

06:00.651 --> 06:02.612
Ugh, I feel sick.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.614
G-Guevaru!

06:06.699 --> 06:10.161
Even though its owner's head is spinning,

06:11.037 --> 06:13.664
this thing's not spinning at all!

06:13.748 --> 06:17.085
So listless, it's not a good look.

06:18.503 --> 06:19.629
Oh?

06:20.254 --> 06:23.132
Now, that's a moon you don't see everyday.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.886
It's not every day you see all the
members of Mouth together either.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.138
I can't sleep through this.

06:31.557 --> 06:35.061
The chemical reaction that occurs
when you three are together,

06:35.144 --> 06:38.689
it's the kind of teamwork you see
with identical triplets.

06:38.773 --> 06:40.900
It must be pretty awesome.

06:42.235 --> 06:47.281
Villains, warriors recognized as the best,

06:47.949 --> 06:51.411
all seem to meet a bad ending
when they encounter you lot.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.121
It's truly interesting.

06:55.998 --> 06:57.417
How nostalgic.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.128
Reminds me of
my youthful days as a pirate.

07:00.211 --> 07:02.922
It was always this kind of night
when we set out.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.967
A crazy bright moon like this,

07:06.634 --> 07:08.302
when we set sail.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.473
Amateurs.

07:13.099 --> 07:16.394
Just now,
while you were looking at the moon,

07:16.477 --> 07:19.230
I could have taken one of you out.

07:20.064 --> 07:24.068
With how much you rely on your teamwork,
with one of you gone,

07:24.152 --> 07:27.071
your fighting capability
would have been one-tenth of what it is.

07:27.822 --> 07:30.575
But since that wouldn't be any fun,
I let you live.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.326
Be more careful.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.329
They're overwhelmed.

07:35.413 --> 07:38.833
The battle-hardened Mouth
are overwhelmed by young Guevaru.

07:46.966 --> 07:47.842
Really?

07:49.427 --> 07:51.596
You're quite confident.

07:52.305 --> 07:56.350
As soon as you took this formation,
your expressions relaxed.

07:56.434 --> 07:58.060
It's too late,

07:58.144 --> 08:00.855
now that you allowed us
to take this formation.

08:02.356 --> 08:04.484
You no longer stand a chance.

08:05.067 --> 08:06.235
Oh, yeah?

08:06.319 --> 08:08.321
I'm looking forward to it.

08:19.081 --> 08:21.501
Hey! You imbecile!

08:23.586 --> 08:24.754
Whoa!

08:34.096 --> 08:36.766
A-Are you an idiot?

08:36.849 --> 08:39.018
What a relief!

08:39.101 --> 08:41.521
Y-You son of a--

08:46.609 --> 08:48.361
You're okay with this?

08:48.444 --> 08:50.530
Two of you are nice and clean,

08:50.613 --> 08:53.282
while one of you is covered in filth.

08:53.866 --> 08:57.495
The devil who ruined your relationship
as an irreplaceable trio

08:57.578 --> 09:00.540
is laying down on the ground before you.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.626
Teach him a lesson.

09:26.774 --> 09:28.442
His bark was worse than his bite.

09:29.360 --> 09:32.989
This is the strength of the man
who made everyone call him Mr. Second?

09:39.287 --> 09:40.121
Wind.

09:42.331 --> 09:43.958
It's a nice wind.

09:44.917 --> 09:46.752
W-Wind?

09:52.091 --> 09:54.468
Did he call the wind?

10:45.519 --> 10:47.021
It's high tide.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.033
Time to set sail.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.538
Now, let's continue.

11:10.628 --> 11:11.545
Fantastic.

11:11.629 --> 11:13.464
What a fantastic scenario.

11:14.465 --> 11:15.383
Until now.

11:16.967 --> 11:18.302
Think about it.

11:18.969 --> 11:20.429
The unexpected entrance.

11:21.222 --> 11:22.807
The pinwheel.

11:23.766 --> 11:24.684
Urinating,

11:25.601 --> 11:26.560
the wind,

11:27.311 --> 11:28.688
and the mud war paint.

11:28.771 --> 11:32.733
Do any of them
speak to his actual ability?

11:33.275 --> 11:35.528
It's nothing more than theatrics.

11:38.280 --> 11:41.200
Come back to your senses.

11:47.790 --> 11:50.710
We should let you know that this formation

11:50.793 --> 11:53.963
is even more deadly than the last one.

11:54.588 --> 11:56.549
Now that your bladder is empty,

11:56.632 --> 11:58.968
how will you overcome this tetrahedron?

12:01.971 --> 12:04.473
You've climbed so high!

12:05.057 --> 12:06.392
Are you alright?

12:06.475 --> 12:08.060
Can you get down by yourself?

12:40.050 --> 12:41.177
He's a monster!

12:41.761 --> 12:43.429
"He isn't human."

12:43.512 --> 12:44.764
That feeling urged Lip,

12:44.847 --> 12:48.309
the leader of Mouth,
and every cell in his body, to run.

12:50.561 --> 12:54.273
Splattering a blend of his
and another man's piss along the way.

13:07.203 --> 13:11.040
Hey, you got down by yourself.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.793
Given the three could no longer
depend on their teamwork,

13:14.627 --> 13:17.755
there was no need
to even try and settle the battle.

13:28.682 --> 13:30.309
He's so strong!

13:30.893 --> 13:32.353
Too strong!

13:32.436 --> 13:35.314
He defeated Mouth,
who had just easily beat Michael,

13:35.397 --> 13:36.982
with a single punch!

13:37.900 --> 13:39.819
Wow.

13:40.444 --> 13:41.737
Deputy Warden Samuels.

13:42.696 --> 13:43.823
Come forward.

13:46.242 --> 13:49.829
It looks like there was some trouble here.

13:50.412 --> 13:52.081
I leave it to you.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.000
I'm going to bed.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.585
-Excuse me.
-Hmm?

13:58.671 --> 14:01.632
Oh, if it isn't Michael!

14:01.715 --> 14:03.092
You forgot about me?

14:03.759 --> 14:07.096
I've never seen such a big punch before.

14:07.179 --> 14:10.182
Oh! What an honor!

14:10.266 --> 14:13.102
To receive such praise
from the strongest boxer on Earth.

14:13.185 --> 14:15.521
If you hadn't come,

14:15.604 --> 14:19.108
my life as a boxer would have
undoubtedly been finished.

14:20.067 --> 14:21.694
What are you saying?

14:22.862 --> 14:25.489
We're roommates, after all!

14:25.573 --> 14:27.283
You had forgotten about me!

14:27.366 --> 14:29.869
Ah, it's all good! It's all good!

14:34.039 --> 14:35.583
-Mr. Second.
-Hm?

14:38.419 --> 14:41.463
I thank God I was put
in the same cell as you.

14:42.089 --> 14:44.592
Of course, I thank you even more.

14:45.593 --> 14:46.844
Thanks, boss.

14:47.928 --> 14:50.055
I was bored this sleepless night,

14:50.139 --> 14:53.559
but was pleasantly surprised
with a great recreational activity.

14:54.184 --> 14:57.104
I should be the one thanking you, brother.

14:58.397 --> 15:00.858
-Good night, brother.
-Yup!

15:03.027 --> 15:03.861
Huh?

15:07.615 --> 15:08.616
Mr. Guevaru.

15:09.199 --> 15:10.034
Baki!

15:10.993 --> 15:14.330
I don't care if you win or lose
the fight with Mr. Oliva.

15:15.039 --> 15:17.708
But, the day after the
fight, I ask that you--

15:17.791 --> 15:21.003
I won't be your boyfriend.

15:21.086 --> 15:21.962
What?

15:22.046 --> 15:25.633
But you can fight me anytime.

15:26.216 --> 15:27.718
Even if there's no wind.

15:28.302 --> 15:31.597
Even if it's right here, right now.

15:33.807 --> 15:35.309
Is this it?

15:37.811 --> 15:39.897
Guevaru, are you there?

15:40.731 --> 15:43.651
Oh, there you are!

15:46.737 --> 15:49.156
No, Mister, stop!

15:49.782 --> 15:52.660
I have the key. Mister, please stop!

15:55.871 --> 15:59.375
Good evening, Mr. Guevaru.

15:59.458 --> 16:00.417
Oliva.

16:00.501 --> 16:01.669
Unchained.

16:02.711 --> 16:06.048
Aww, look what you did to the door!

16:06.131 --> 16:08.050
Put up a curtain or something.

16:08.133 --> 16:10.928
What kind of prison doesn't have doors?

16:11.011 --> 16:11.929
No!

16:12.680 --> 16:13.931
Guevaru, is it?

16:14.598 --> 16:16.934
You have a good look.

16:18.185 --> 16:19.687
I like the expression.

16:20.771 --> 16:23.565
Not blustering, not intimidating.

16:24.191 --> 16:26.944
But, not arrogant, either.

16:27.027 --> 16:32.533
You show clearly on your face
exactly what you're capable of.

16:33.117 --> 16:35.202
That's easier said than done.

16:36.245 --> 16:38.288
While it may be small,

16:38.372 --> 16:42.084
you've built a new country at
a young age. That's no small feat.

16:44.044 --> 16:46.213
But, it is such a pity!

16:46.296 --> 16:47.589
A pity?

16:47.673 --> 16:49.758
God may have gifted you

16:49.842 --> 16:55.848
with first-rate character,
intelligence, and leadership,

16:55.931 --> 16:59.601
But you have one major flaw, Guevaru!

17:00.686 --> 17:02.104
As do I.

17:07.401 --> 17:08.861
You're exactly right.

17:08.944 --> 17:12.614
Despite our age,
we don't like to lose in a fight.

17:12.698 --> 17:15.492
From a toddler to a boy,

17:15.576 --> 17:18.120
from a boy to a young man,

17:18.203 --> 17:20.122
eventually becoming an adult.

17:20.205 --> 17:23.876
Something we should have left behind
as we developed.

17:23.959 --> 17:27.629
A decisive immaturity:
wanting to win fights.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.298
I became a man,

17:30.382 --> 17:32.634
and stopped wanting candy.

17:32.718 --> 17:35.387
I stopped playing with my yo-yo.

17:35.471 --> 17:37.598
I stopped playing tag.

17:38.557 --> 17:40.517
I stopped spinning tops,

17:40.601 --> 17:42.644
and stopped collecting cards.

17:44.772 --> 17:46.398
And yet…

17:48.067 --> 17:49.693
And yet…

17:52.237 --> 17:54.656
Fighting remained.

17:54.740 --> 17:58.285
While we may have that in common,

17:59.369 --> 18:01.663
we have one definitive difference.

18:03.832 --> 18:06.752
In what way do you think you are superior?

18:06.835 --> 18:08.962
I fight for the sake of others.

18:10.339 --> 18:13.509
Does a fight have to be for someone else?

18:14.593 --> 18:16.929
What do you think, Guevaru?

18:18.764 --> 18:23.060
I'm of the opinion that needing
something or someone to fight for

18:23.811 --> 18:26.939
is actually a weakness.

18:27.606 --> 18:30.526
What do you think, Mr. Oliva?

18:35.114 --> 18:37.699
You're going to lose.

18:40.619 --> 18:43.247
You said you fight for another?

18:44.414 --> 18:49.461
For my sweet girl, of course!

18:50.045 --> 18:53.465
She's just so cute!

18:54.049 --> 18:55.092
What?

18:55.175 --> 18:58.720
I wondered what your answer would be,
but a woman?

18:59.888 --> 19:03.767
You want to show off how strong you are
to your girl?

19:10.149 --> 19:12.109
Just when I was thinking

19:12.192 --> 19:15.571
that you two were the greatest of rivals,
the strongest of opponents,

19:16.155 --> 19:20.075
and that I was so happy
to meet you here…

19:20.868 --> 19:23.579
Are you two screwing with me?

19:24.163 --> 19:26.081
What is this I'm hearing?

19:26.165 --> 19:29.918
"Fighting still remains"?
"Fight for someone else"?

19:30.002 --> 19:30.836
Baki.

19:30.919 --> 19:34.590
Talking about what's necessary
or what's not necessary to fight?

19:35.174 --> 19:38.594
Stop the hanky-panky and boasting--

19:54.359 --> 19:57.029
They say even savage beasts
trying to kill each other

19:57.112 --> 20:01.617
will work together to expel an interloper.

20:02.451 --> 20:06.205
What happened to Baki was inevitable.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.957
Jealousy, huh?

20:09.541 --> 20:12.377
Of all the fluids in the world,

20:13.003 --> 20:17.049
the most potent liquid is the Hanma blood.

20:17.591 --> 20:20.135
The stimulation was too strong for it.

20:20.219 --> 20:23.805
Was it too much hanky-panky?

20:23.889 --> 20:27.643
No, not as much as you and your girl.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.615
How stimulating!

20:42.532 --> 20:44.368
A present from her?

20:44.451 --> 20:45.827
Wrong.

20:46.912 --> 20:50.165
I bought this in the town
where she used to live.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.042
Town?

20:52.960 --> 20:55.671
You mean that's not something
that belonged to her?

20:55.754 --> 20:57.798
Don't be ridiculous.

20:57.881 --> 21:01.426
That would be far too stimulating for me.

21:01.510 --> 21:02.594
No way.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.888
You two are lovers, right?

21:04.972 --> 21:06.390
Of course.

21:06.473 --> 21:07.975
We love each other.

21:08.058 --> 21:10.185
We're both deeply in love.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.437
I don't get it.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.690
That's fine by me.

21:14.773 --> 21:16.775
A child wouldn't understand.

21:17.276 --> 21:22.948
Just by the fact this handkerchief
existed in the area where she lived,

21:24.032 --> 21:26.702
I can feel her presence.

21:27.577 --> 21:30.497
Like when a tourist buys
something in Liverpool,

21:30.580 --> 21:33.834
they can feel the presence
of that legendary band.

21:34.543 --> 21:38.463
I'm that much of a fan of hers!

21:38.547 --> 21:41.216
She's that beautiful!

21:41.800 --> 21:42.634
How about it?

21:43.176 --> 21:44.970
Wanna take a whiff?

21:45.929 --> 21:50.225
It's the most fragrant handkerchief
in the world.

22:11.830 --> 22:14.958
The most fragrant thing in the world,

22:15.542 --> 22:18.086
is not that handkerchief.

23:47.175 --> 23:51.179
