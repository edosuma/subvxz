<i> ["The Ballad Of</i>
     <i> Gilligan's Isle"]</i>

00:03.537 --> 00:06.104
¶ Just sit right back
    and you'll hear a tale ¶

00:06.173 --> 00:08.240
¶ A tale of a fateful trip ¶

00:08.309 --> 00:10.375
¶ That started
    from this tropic port ¶

00:10.443 --> 00:12.610
¶ Aboard this tiny ship ¶

00:12.679 --> 00:15.180
¶ The mate was a mighty
    sailing man ¶

00:15.249 --> 00:17.549
¶ The Skipper brave and sure ¶

00:17.618 --> 00:20.018
¶ Five passengers
      set sail that day ¶

00:20.086 --> 00:22.254
¶ For a three hour tour ¶

00:22.323 --> 00:25.023
¶ A three hour tour ¶

00:25.092 --> 00:27.192
[thunder rumbling]

00:27.261 --> 00:29.394
¶ The weather started
     getting rough ¶

00:29.463 --> 00:31.630
¶ The tiny ship was tossed ¶

00:31.698 --> 00:34.432
¶ If not for the courage
    of the fearless crew ¶

00:34.501 --> 00:36.434
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:36.503 --> 00:38.703
¶ The Minnow would be lost ¶

00:38.772 --> 00:41.273
¶ The ship set ground
     on the shore of this ¶

00:41.341 --> 00:43.408
¶ Uncharted desert isle ¶

00:43.477 --> 00:45.843
¶ With Gilligan ¶

00:45.912 --> 00:48.146
¶ The Skipper too ¶

00:48.215 --> 00:50.215
¶ The millionaire ¶

00:50.284 --> 00:52.784
¶ And his wife ¶

00:52.853 --> 00:55.554
¶ The movie star ¶

00:55.623 --> 00:57.389
¶ And the rest ¶

01:15.508 --> 01:16.542
Ooh.

01:18.411 --> 01:19.578
Ahh.

01:20.880 --> 01:22.815
Gilligan, don't you think
it's clever of the Professor

01:22.883 --> 01:24.082
to have thought
of this carrier?

01:24.151 --> 01:25.818
This is the way
the Dutch girls carry milk.

01:25.886 --> 01:28.319
No wonder they had
           to wear wooden shoes.

01:28.388 --> 01:30.154
And exactly what is
that supposed to mean?

01:30.223 --> 01:31.423
Maybe one coconut
               weighs nothing.

01:31.492 --> 01:33.192
Maybe two coconuts
              weigh nothing.

01:33.260 --> 01:34.692
But 15 of these
                weigh something.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.828
We've got enough coconuts here
  to last six months.

01:36.897 --> 01:40.265
- Well, let's get six more.
 - There's no more left to get.

01:40.333 --> 01:42.134
Gilligan, you're looking
in the wrong direction.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.703
[birds chirping]

01:46.474 --> 01:49.141
Gilligan, I'll start
      back with these.

01:50.744 --> 01:51.877
[leaves crackling]

01:53.447 --> 01:57.782
Sure. Gilligan, do this.
    Gilligan, do that.

01:57.851 --> 02:00.486
Gilligan, go here,
      Gilligan, go there.

02:00.554 --> 02:03.955
Gilligan, get this.
      Gilligan, get that.

02:04.024 --> 02:06.324
Mmm.

02:06.393 --> 02:08.026
I could just rest all day
   and take it easy

02:08.095 --> 02:09.695
if my name wasn't Gilligan.

02:09.763 --> 02:12.597
There's just five,
     and Skipper said six.

02:12.666 --> 02:15.066
Well, I'm not going
      to get him six.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.269
Yeah, I'll get him six.

02:17.338 --> 02:18.570
There it is.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.639
Number six.
         Come on, baby.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.642
Help!

02:23.711 --> 02:24.843
[thud]

02:29.115 --> 02:32.151
(Gilligan)
           'Help!'

02:35.289 --> 02:37.288
Gilligan, Gilli..?

02:37.357 --> 02:40.625
Oh, my buddy.
Oh, please!

02:40.694 --> 02:42.494
I heard him shout,
         Skipper. What happened?

02:42.562 --> 02:45.129
He must have fallen
out of the tree, Professor.

02:45.198 --> 02:48.066
- Oh!
  - Easy now, gently, gently.

02:48.135 --> 02:49.867
- Let's turn him over.
     - Alright.

02:49.936 --> 02:51.269
Oh, watch it now!

02:51.338 --> 02:54.339
- There, there we go.
     - Oh.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.709
Doesn't seem to be
              any broken bones.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.745
Probably had the wind
           knocked out of him.

02:59.813 --> 03:01.680
Oh, he-he said we had
enough coconuts

03:01.749 --> 03:03.548
and I made him climb
and get more.

03:03.616 --> 03:06.118
If anything happens to him,
I'll never forgive myself.

03:06.187 --> 03:08.086
- Let's get him up.
    - Yes, let's get him up.

03:08.154 --> 03:09.387
[groaning]

03:09.456 --> 03:12.291
- Up, easy.
        - There you are.

03:14.060 --> 03:16.195
Ahh, oh!

03:20.533 --> 03:23.368
Gilligan, Gilligan.
             Take a deep breath.

03:23.437 --> 03:25.938
But breathe through
your mouth, little buddy.

03:28.642 --> 03:31.243
Take it easy, Gilligan,
it's just a cold compress.

03:32.278 --> 03:34.479
Oh, your poor,
                  poor nose.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.481
It really is
                  an awful mess.

03:36.550 --> 03:40.218
It's actually swollen to the
size of a 55-carat diamond.

03:40.287 --> 03:43.255
- Oh.
     - Please, Mrs. Howell.

03:43.324 --> 03:44.489
Professor, it's broken,
         it's broken!

03:44.558 --> 03:46.491
Gilligan, I'm sure
it's just bruised.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.560
- It's only slightly swollen.
 - Slightly swollen?

03:48.629 --> 03:52.530
You better look out for the
 pelicans during mating season.

03:52.599 --> 03:54.333
Ginger.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.067
Professor, look, it's just
   busted you can see--

03:56.136 --> 03:57.702
You ought to be happy
to be alive.

03:57.771 --> 03:59.737
You're lucky you fell
on that soft sand.

03:59.806 --> 04:01.506
- Soft? It's busted--
     - You know something?

04:01.575 --> 04:03.942
This is the first real accident
since we were shipwrecked.

04:04.010 --> 04:05.343
Big deal.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.211
I think we should be prepared
for emergencies.

04:07.280 --> 04:09.280
Yes, this could happen
to any of us.

04:09.349 --> 04:10.982
Please, my career.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.517
I have a medical book.

04:12.585 --> 04:14.552
I'm going to give everyone
lessons in first-aid.

04:14.621 --> 04:17.755
That's a marvelous idea.
I used to be a nurse's aid.

04:17.824 --> 04:19.991
Well, you should know something
about emergency treatment.

04:20.060 --> 04:21.760
Uh, not really.

04:21.829 --> 04:24.362
They took my picture
    quite often pouring tea

04:24.431 --> 04:27.132
but I didn't know
    very much about aiding.

04:27.201 --> 04:29.234
I do make very good tea though.

04:29.303 --> 04:32.303
How about you, Ginger, have you
had any experience as a nurse?

04:32.372 --> 04:34.605
No, but I'm sure
    I'd be wonderful at it.

04:34.674 --> 04:36.474
I look very good in white.

04:36.543 --> 04:38.577
Alright, Gilligan, you just
apply this cold compress

04:38.645 --> 04:40.178
and that should take
the swelling down.

04:40.246 --> 04:41.746
I feel like Pinocchio.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.781
- Gilligan, you know that--
  - Never mind, Mrs. Howell.

04:43.850 --> 04:45.784
Let's get started on our
    first-aid lessons.

04:45.852 --> 04:47.919
Come along, ladies.
      This way.

04:47.988 --> 04:50.055
[upbeat music]

04:51.525 --> 04:53.758
Professor said to start
with the wrist and--

04:53.827 --> 04:55.826
Be-be careful of that
           wrist, Mary Ann.

04:55.895 --> 04:57.796
That's the hand
              that signs checks.

05:00.567 --> 05:03.034
Now, Ginger, suppose a man
is lying unconscious.

05:03.103 --> 05:05.637
He's just suffered a severe
concussion, what would you do?

05:06.840 --> 05:09.307
I'd give a mouth-to-mouth
       resuscitation.

05:09.376 --> 05:11.275
- That wouldn't help.
     - Wouldn't hurt.

05:11.344 --> 05:13.311
You're supposed to cover him
with a blanket

05:13.380 --> 05:15.046
to make sure he doesn't suffer
from shock.

05:15.115 --> 05:17.349
And then I give him
   mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

05:18.452 --> 05:19.851
Is this alright?

05:19.920 --> 05:21.953
Oh, you don't need anything
  quite so elaborate.

05:22.022 --> 05:25.022
Don't think I'd have Thurston
anything but gift-wrapped.

05:25.091 --> 05:27.292
Our class will tell.

05:27.361 --> 05:29.260
Now listen, an important
        point is how you turn

05:29.329 --> 05:30.828
an accident victim over.

05:30.897 --> 05:33.832
Now, Ginger, you place your hand
under Mr. Howell's shoulders.

05:33.901 --> 05:36.667
Mrs. Howell, you place
      your hands under his back.

05:36.736 --> 05:39.137
And Mary Ann, under his knees.

05:39.206 --> 05:42.341
Now, very gently, turn him over.

05:42.943 --> 05:44.443
[all scream]

05:45.845 --> 05:47.412
It's just a sprain,
Mr. Howell.

05:47.481 --> 05:48.914
It'll be better before
you go to bed tonight.

05:48.982 --> 05:50.348
I hope so.

05:50.417 --> 05:55.152
If it isn't, I won't be able
  to cuddle my teddy...properly.

05:55.221 --> 05:58.790
(Mrs. Howell)
  'Can you tell us what we did
  wrong last time, Professor?'

05:58.859 --> 05:59.925
Now, ladies

05:59.993 --> 06:02.160
you're supposed to turn
    the patient over gently.

06:02.229 --> 06:03.861
You needn't push quite so hard.

06:03.930 --> 06:05.296
Do you want me
                  to help them.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.797
Kind of roll over
               like something--

06:06.866 --> 06:09.934
- No, no, you're unconscious.
 - Oh, that's right.

06:10.003 --> 06:12.537
- Now, take it easy, girls.
  - Okay.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.873
- A little harder than that.
  - Okay, push..

06:14.941 --> 06:17.308
All together. One,
              two, three..

06:17.377 --> 06:18.677
Help!

06:18.746 --> 06:19.745
[thud]

06:21.281 --> 06:22.580
Now, it's just
a sprain, Skipper.

06:22.649 --> 06:24.883
It'll be better before
you go to bed tonight.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.050
Thanks, Professor.

06:26.119 --> 06:29.821
I must say we make
a handsome pair of bookends.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.590
This is dreadful.
 We're running out of victims.

06:32.659 --> 06:34.926
Well, I guess, I'll have
    to do this myself.

06:35.929 --> 06:37.128
Now, ladies.

06:37.197 --> 06:39.297
I want you to listen
     to me very carefully.

06:39.365 --> 06:42.401
And I want you to do <i> exactly</i>
 what I tell you.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.904
Don't worry, Professor,
      it's just a little sprain.

06:45.972 --> 06:48.707
I'm sure it'll be better
before you go to bed tonight.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.508
It's not the wrist
       I'm worried about.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.644
I better exercise this knee

06:52.713 --> 06:54.746
before it begins
      to stiffen up on me.

06:56.316 --> 06:59.017
[theme song tune]

07:04.991 --> 07:07.325
I don't know whether my nose
  is getting smaller

07:07.394 --> 07:09.127
or my face
       is getting bigger.

07:14.033 --> 07:16.000
Hi, Skipper,
           what happened to you?

07:16.069 --> 07:18.602
Oh, well, Professor's giving
us a first-aid course

07:18.671 --> 07:20.839
for emergencies,
but what he didn't say was

07:20.908 --> 07:23.542
the first emergency
would be the first-aid course.

07:26.180 --> 07:28.212
- How's the nose, little buddy?
- Terrible.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.815
Professor said it'd be a while
before that swelling went down.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.550
I think it'll
                  stay this way.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.151
I wasn't too handsome
           to begin with.

07:34.220 --> 07:36.387
It's is like something
          that should be hanging

07:36.456 --> 07:37.722
in a delicatessen store.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.725
It's all my fault.
I ordered you up that tree.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.028
- Skipper, it's not your fault.
- It is.

07:43.096 --> 07:44.829
And I'll never give you
another order.

07:44.898 --> 07:46.464
Skipper, you didn't
             make me fall.

07:46.533 --> 07:48.432
Gilligan, no matter
what you say..

07:48.501 --> 07:50.067
I mean we're not
aboard ship anymore.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.437
It's my fault.
I shouldn't give you orders.

07:52.505 --> 07:54.239
And I'll never give you
another order.

07:54.308 --> 07:55.774
Skipper,
              it's all my fault.

07:55.842 --> 07:57.775
It was mine,
and that's an order.

07:57.844 --> 08:00.245
- Aye aye, Skip.. Oh!
     - Ahh!

08:00.313 --> 08:01.513
- Gilligan.
          - Hi, Prof..

08:01.582 --> 08:03.214
Say...how's that nose
     coming along?

08:03.282 --> 08:04.582
What happened to you?

08:04.651 --> 08:06.384
I didn't know broken arms
       are contagious.

08:06.453 --> 08:08.285
Our arms aren't broken,
 Gilligan, they're just sprain

08:08.354 --> 08:09.754
from our first-aid course.

08:09.823 --> 08:12.357
I wish you'd never found that
chapter in a medical book.

08:12.426 --> 08:15.126
That medical book. Does it have
a chapter on operations?

08:15.195 --> 08:17.228
I mean, could you, like,
    fix my broken nose?

08:17.297 --> 08:19.731
It must have, after that
chapter on first aid.

08:19.799 --> 08:22.066
Gilligan, your nose isn't
      broken, it's just bruised.

08:22.135 --> 08:24.135
Now, you keep applying those
    cold compresses..

08:24.204 --> 08:25.837
No more water, I'll drown.

08:25.906 --> 08:28.206
...and in a few days,
      the swelling will be gone.

08:28.275 --> 08:30.241
No, it won't because
        it's broken, we operate?

08:30.310 --> 08:33.345
The professor says your nose
isn't broken, it isn't broken.

08:33.413 --> 08:35.913
- Or else it would hurt right--
- No!

08:35.982 --> 08:37.948
See, it is broken.
              Ooh.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.784
Gilligan, your nose
isn't broken.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.119
Keep saying it to yourself.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.320
My nose isn't broken.
My nose isn't broken.

08:43.389 --> 08:46.925
Skipper, I know your nose
isn't broken, my nose is broken.

08:48.061 --> 08:50.127
- Hi, Lovey.
- Oh, where have you been, dear?

08:50.196 --> 08:52.396
I just finished
your beautiful new sling.

08:52.465 --> 08:53.665
Oh, thank you, yes.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.333
I've just come
           from seeing Gilligan.

08:55.402 --> 08:56.934
Oh, it's terrible.

08:57.003 --> 08:59.738
Every time I see that boy's
     nose, I think of inflation.

08:59.806 --> 09:01.773
Let me try on your
new sling, darling.

09:01.842 --> 09:04.342
Darling, be very, very careful.
 Oh, that's nice.

09:04.411 --> 09:06.644
There must be something
         we can do for Gilligan.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.946
Maybe I should go over
and cheer him up.

09:09.015 --> 09:10.515
After all, a nose
isn't everything.

09:10.584 --> 09:12.517
It is if you're an anteater.

09:12.586 --> 09:16.221
- Oh! Oh! Lovey!
     - Oh, I'm sorry, dear.

09:16.289 --> 09:19.424
You know, I really
     must convince Gilligan

09:19.493 --> 09:21.226
that a nose
      doesn't make a man.

09:22.629 --> 09:23.895
[knocking on door]

09:23.963 --> 09:26.631
- Come in.
 - Oh, there you are, Gilligan.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.166
I've been looking
             for you everywhere.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.301
I'm not hard to find.

09:29.369 --> 09:30.969
Just look for my nose,
I'll be somewhere near it.

09:31.038 --> 09:34.906
Yes. Now, let me take
           a good look at you.

09:34.975 --> 09:37.742
No, Mrs. Howell,
I'm a mess.

09:37.810 --> 09:41.846
- Oh,<i> au contraire!</i>
      - Is it that bad?

09:41.915 --> 09:44.582
<i> Au contraire</i> means
             on the contrary.

09:44.651 --> 09:47.118
I think your new nose
           is <i> marvelous.</i>

09:47.187 --> 09:49.420
It really adds a great deal
  to your face.

09:49.489 --> 09:51.055
Yeah, two pounds.

09:51.124 --> 09:53.258
I mean, it fits
       your face so well.

09:53.327 --> 09:55.126
You're much more
      attractive this way.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.327
I am?

09:56.396 --> 09:59.430
Oh yes, you're so rugged,
   so <i> masculine.</i>

09:59.499 --> 10:03.167
- It's a real <i> man's</i> nose.
   - I should hope so.

10:03.236 --> 10:06.137
You never saw anything
   like this on Miss America.

10:06.206 --> 10:09.773
It's true, but...I think
    you're very fortunate

10:09.842 --> 10:11.109
to have had this accident.

10:11.177 --> 10:13.745
This nose gives your face
   such strength.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.846
Good, my face will need
    a lot more strength

10:15.915 --> 10:17.349
just to carry it around.

10:21.721 --> 10:23.655
[romantic music]

10:30.296 --> 10:31.696
Hi, Ginger.

10:32.732 --> 10:34.666
- Can I sit down?
       - Sure.

10:36.335 --> 10:39.270
- What are you doing?
   - I'm making a new fish trap.

10:39.339 --> 10:42.073
Oh, you wouldn't have
     to make a trap to catch me.

10:42.141 --> 10:43.541
Huh?

10:43.610 --> 10:46.944
You know, Gilligan, th-there's
something about your face that..

10:47.013 --> 10:49.481
I don't know
        it's...irresistible now.

10:49.549 --> 10:52.283
- Must be my nose.
       - Oh, yeah.

10:52.352 --> 10:54.085
Yeah, it's your nose,
           it's so, it's--

10:54.154 --> 10:56.887
- Masculine?
          - Exactly.

10:56.956 --> 11:00.090
Your face is rugged now, it just
gives it so much strength.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.026
That's exactly
what Mrs. Howell said.

11:02.095 --> 11:06.131
She's right. You've become
      so attractive, Gilligan.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.534
You know...you look like
        Cyrano de Bergerac now.

11:10.603 --> 11:13.671
- Cero who did Brugia what?
  - Cyrano de Bergerac.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.973
Oh, he was a man
    with an odd-looking nose

11:16.042 --> 11:19.077
and the most beautiful woman in
the world was in love with him.

11:19.145 --> 11:21.779
- Roxanne.
 - Oh, that's a beautiful name.

11:21.848 --> 11:26.785
- Yeah, Roxanne.
   - No, Cyrano de Bergerac.

11:28.488 --> 11:31.655
You know, all through history,
  women have been attracted

11:31.724 --> 11:33.324
to men with interesting noses.

11:33.393 --> 11:36.261
- My nose is interesting?
   - Very.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.331
- How about a little kiss?
   - Sure.

11:43.303 --> 11:44.068
Well..

11:44.137 --> 11:46.304
How about a week
from tomorrow?

11:46.372 --> 11:47.505
A week from tomorrow?

11:47.574 --> 11:50.709
Yeah, by then, my nose would
hurt if it touches you.

11:52.746 --> 11:55.579
If a nose like this would make
 girls throw themselves at me

11:55.648 --> 11:57.215
I'd have busted it years ago.

11:57.284 --> 11:58.750
Does make me look
       handsomer though.

11:58.818 --> 11:59.750
[knocking]

11:59.819 --> 12:01.819
Come in.

12:01.888 --> 12:05.256
- Hi, Gilligan.
      - Oh, hi, Mary Ann.

12:05.325 --> 12:07.358
Tonight's gonna be a full moon,
 I was wondering

12:07.427 --> 12:08.793
if you'd like to take
           a walk with me.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.995
Well, maybe so.

12:11.063 --> 12:13.430
Gee, Gilligan, I-I always
       have liked you but..

12:13.499 --> 12:16.501
- Well, somehow now, it's..
  - It's my nose.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.869
I guess you're right.

12:18.938 --> 12:20.538
It's been that way
down through history.

12:20.607 --> 12:21.973
Take Roxanne and
Cyrano de Bergerac.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.541
Oh, that's right.

12:23.609 --> 12:26.143
All three of them settled down
and lived happily ever after.

12:26.212 --> 12:27.611
- All three of them?
      - Uh-ha.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.214
Roxanne, Cyrano, and his nose.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.349
Gilligan, I think it's wonderful
the way you've adjusted.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.585
I know the accident
might've spoiled my looks.

12:34.654 --> 12:36.687
Turns out I needed it.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.490
- Until the night.
       - Good.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.762
I guess some guys got it,
   and some guys don't.

12:45.264 --> 12:46.998
It works like a charm,
     Mrs. Howell.

12:47.067 --> 12:49.100
Gilligan really thinks
     he looks better now.

12:49.169 --> 12:52.069
Yes, he believed every word.
  It's lucky I'm a good actress.

12:52.138 --> 12:54.706
- Mmm.
      - Oh, that poor boy.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.574
We've got to keep
saying these things

12:56.643 --> 12:58.910
until he gets used to
his new looks.

12:58.979 --> 13:02.514
Run along, girls. We mustn't let
Gilligan know our plan.

13:30.744 --> 13:32.477
[insects chirping]

13:33.412 --> 13:35.346
[splash]

13:46.325 --> 13:48.392
Professor, you got
              to fix my nose.

13:48.461 --> 13:51.162
I don't like it anymore.
 Everybody hates the way I look.

13:51.231 --> 13:53.931
You just got to operate
         on me and fix it!

13:54.000 --> 13:55.532
I'm afraid I've to operate
after all.

13:55.601 --> 13:58.769
I won't take no for an answer.
 You got the medical book.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.839
- Operate on my nose and fix it.
- Gilligan, I said I'd operate.

14:01.908 --> 14:04.842
I don't care what you said.
  Operate my nose and fix it.

14:04.911 --> 14:07.879
Gilligan, I said
    I was going to operate.

14:07.947 --> 14:10.281
- That's better.
        - Yes.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.783
I thought it was swollen,
   but I was wrong.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.318
We'll set up an operating room.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.554
The girls will assist
     me, and I'll operate.

14:16.623 --> 14:17.755
- You will?
          - 'Yes.'

14:17.824 --> 14:19.524
You prepare for surgery
    in the morning.

14:19.592 --> 14:24.128
Professor, I'd be more than
happy to prepare for sur...gery?

14:28.668 --> 14:29.833
- Hi, Professor.
        - Oh, Gilligan.

14:29.902 --> 14:31.135
I've got good news.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.970
Just finished cooking up
        an anesthetic for you.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.271
- At is?
         - Anesthetic.

14:34.340 --> 14:36.073
For you to sleep
           during the operation.

14:36.142 --> 14:37.608
If I sleep,
I'll miss everything.

14:37.677 --> 14:39.844
- Would you rather stay up?
  - Keep cooking.

14:39.913 --> 14:41.279
You see, Gilligan.

14:41.347 --> 14:43.380
There are various plants
        and roots on this island

14:43.449 --> 14:45.883
which are analgesic in nature
   due to the presence

14:45.952 --> 14:47.551
of nitrous oxide compounds.

14:47.620 --> 14:50.254
In the concentrated form, they
 make an effective anesthetic.

14:50.323 --> 14:51.555
It figures.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.858
- I think that's enough heat.
 - You got the stuff?

14:53.927 --> 14:56.227
- That's it.
          - Yeah.

15:00.533 --> 15:01.732
[sniffing]

15:01.801 --> 15:05.169
- I don't smell a thing.
- Gilligan, don't breathe that.

15:09.308 --> 15:11.809
I don't feel a thing,
     I don't smell a thing.

15:11.877 --> 15:13.177
'You know, professor.'

15:13.245 --> 15:14.779
I was worried
   about the operation before

15:14.847 --> 15:17.682
but I'm not worried anymore
because you're being so careful.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.217
[laughing]

15:20.386 --> 15:22.854
Gilligan, I think
      you better sit down.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.521
Why? I feel just fine.

15:24.590 --> 15:27.992
It probably just needs
  some more roots or flowers.

15:29.228 --> 15:33.363
Are you sure this is
the stuff that's supposed

15:33.432 --> 15:39.203
to work on me because
  it doesn't have any effect..

15:45.878 --> 15:47.945
- Come on, Gilligan, hurry up.
 - What's the hurry?

15:48.014 --> 15:50.782
It's just the idea, I have
   a wonderful surprise for you.

15:50.850 --> 15:52.416
You have a surprise?
What is it?

15:52.485 --> 15:55.085
Fact that the professor's gonna
 operate, there's no reason

15:55.154 --> 15:57.187
why you shouldn't have
        any shape nose you want.

15:57.256 --> 15:58.756
- Instead of my own?
      - Right.

15:58.825 --> 16:01.559
How would it be to have
         a nose like Cary Grant?

16:01.627 --> 16:03.561
Or maybe Jack Lemmon
            or Jimmy Stewart.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.863
- Or even Julie Andrews.
    - No, not Julie Andrews.

16:05.932 --> 16:08.165
I'd look pretty silly
with a girl's nose.

16:08.234 --> 16:10.200
With noses, it doesn't
          make any difference.

16:10.269 --> 16:12.369
Gilligan, boys and girls,
       it's all the same.

16:12.438 --> 16:14.439
Yeah, but I have to powder
and everything.

16:14.507 --> 16:16.507
Alright, forget that I mentioned
Julie Andrews's nose.

16:16.576 --> 16:18.508
- But what about the others?
  - Sounds great.

16:18.577 --> 16:20.511
Well, wonderful.
              Come on, Gilligan.

16:24.950 --> 16:26.684
I think it's the right
consistency now.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.719
I've got this apron
             to keep him tidy.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.788
- Very good ideas, Gilligan.
 - Skipper. What's that stuff?

16:30.856 --> 16:33.590
Gilligan, this is clay. We're
gonna make an exact duplicate

16:33.659 --> 16:36.427
of your head, then we can try
different noses on it.

16:36.495 --> 16:39.763
Would you like a nose like mine?
The Howell nose is special.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.399
Doesn't look so special to me.

16:41.468 --> 16:45.536
Not the looks, the nostrils.
 We smell money for ten miles.

16:45.605 --> 16:48.338
Ginger and Mary Ann are making
 different noses so you'll have

16:48.407 --> 16:51.308
something to choose from. Ginger
knows all the movie stars.

16:51.377 --> 16:54.011
Mr. Howell, why don't you help
instead of just standing?

16:54.080 --> 16:56.681
Alright. Oh, this is squishy.

16:58.284 --> 17:00.685
I wonder, is this anything
   like-like making mud pies?

17:00.753 --> 17:03.086
Never made mud pies
      when you were a kid?

17:03.155 --> 17:05.756
Eh, no mother had
    the butler do it for me.

17:05.825 --> 17:08.592
You sure missed a lot
  when you were young. Ha ha.

17:08.661 --> 17:12.162
Had its advantage.
   He took my spankings too.

17:12.231 --> 17:14.265
I wonder if Michelangelo
        got started this way.

17:23.476 --> 17:26.609
(Gilligan)
     Hm. Skipper was right.
     It did dry fast.

17:26.679 --> 17:29.280
I better go tell them
    it's ready to come off.

17:33.419 --> 17:35.386
We've got enough clay
for a dozen noses.

17:35.455 --> 17:37.755
Unless we try
              for Jimmy Durante.

17:44.463 --> 17:46.030
Ginger.

17:46.099 --> 17:48.066
What is it?

17:49.702 --> 17:51.468
(Gilligan)
   Have you seen the Skipper?

17:51.537 --> 17:53.171
Ah!

17:54.774 --> 17:56.774
Wonder what scared them?

17:58.978 --> 18:00.611
What is it?

18:05.885 --> 18:07.618
Oh, it's still after us. Ah!

18:09.822 --> 18:11.155
[knocking on door]

18:11.224 --> 18:13.157
Come in. Ah!

18:15.428 --> 18:20.498
Get.. Ah, get away from me
   y-y-you thing! Ah!

18:20.567 --> 18:23.133
What's the matter with her?

18:23.202 --> 18:25.236
What's got into everybody?

18:26.105 --> 18:28.206
Ah!

18:32.344 --> 18:34.078
What's the matter
with you running around

18:34.147 --> 18:35.813
frightening women
the way you've been doing.

18:35.882 --> 18:39.082
I'm sorry, Skipper,
  but I couldn't find myself.

18:39.151 --> 18:42.452
Mr. Howell, if you'll help me,
 I think this is dry to remove.

18:42.521 --> 18:45.022
Skipper, would you make
   a statue of me like this?

18:45.091 --> 18:48.226
Not just the head
 but the whole big adorable me.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.229
Why certainly, Mr. Howell.

18:52.398 --> 18:56.000
My gosh. I forgot to put
a divider in this.

18:56.068 --> 18:57.367
A divider?

18:57.436 --> 18:59.036
A cardboard piece
       down the middle

18:59.105 --> 19:01.338
to separate in two parts
    and take it off.

19:01.407 --> 19:03.140
You can't get me out of here?

19:03.209 --> 19:05.542
Take it easy now, little buddy.
Take it easy.

19:05.611 --> 19:08.646
It'll save your time combing
  your hair in the morning.

19:08.715 --> 19:11.415
- Let me out of here.
   - Gilligan, just a moment.

19:14.787 --> 19:16.821
Gilligan?

19:16.889 --> 19:18.956
Gilligan, are you alright?

19:19.025 --> 19:22.859
Yes. But make sure you stop
 when you get to the real meat.

19:22.928 --> 19:24.529
Of course, little buddy

19:26.232 --> 19:28.899
You were right, Skipper.
It looks just like me.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.234
Your noses, sir.

19:30.303 --> 19:31.836
'Ah.'

19:35.040 --> 19:37.241
Me with Richard Burton's nose.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.844
Just think how close
it's been to Elizabeth Taylor.

19:47.386 --> 19:48.852
(Mrs. Howell)
This is terribly exciting.

19:48.921 --> 19:51.955
(Ginger)
            Reminds me of a part
            I played as a nurse.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.524
That scene had a happy ending.

19:53.592 --> 19:55.492
Maybe the same
will happen to me.

19:55.561 --> 19:57.495
I doubt it.
    That patient had twins.

20:00.132 --> 20:01.098
- Everyone ready?
       - Yes.

20:01.167 --> 20:02.532
- Yes.
             - Yes.

20:02.601 --> 20:04.568
No.

20:04.636 --> 20:08.171
Look, maybe if I bared you
   like Dr. Beth Casey, huh?

20:08.240 --> 20:10.674
(Mr. Howell)
      Well, if he's gonna
      look like Dr. Casey.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.777
I'm gonna look like Dr. Zorba.

20:12.845 --> 20:14.879
(Professor)
  Mr. Howell, will you please
  administer the anesthetic.

20:14.948 --> 20:17.114
Mrs. Howell, you be
      the head nurse.

20:17.183 --> 20:19.183
Ginger, Mary Ann,
    you assist Mrs. Howell.

20:19.252 --> 20:20.551
(Skipper)
    What do I do, professor?

20:20.620 --> 20:22.286
'You got the medical
      book, Skipper.'

20:22.355 --> 20:24.589
You hold it up while
    I read the instructions.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.523
[gasping]

20:26.592 --> 20:28.659
So whatever you do,
            don't skip two pages

20:28.727 --> 20:30.761
or this boy will be
             minus his appendix.

20:30.830 --> 20:33.097
Maybe we'll wait
    till tomorrow. I think--

20:33.166 --> 20:36.434
(Professor)
We're set. Mr. Howell, please
administer the anesthetic.

20:36.502 --> 20:38.903
Uh, you just breathe deep
       Gilligan, like this.

20:38.971 --> 20:43.340
Take a nice deep breath of this
a-and you.. Oh, my goodness.

20:43.409 --> 20:45.576
I feel faint.

20:45.644 --> 20:47.377
Thurston's always
been very squeamish.

20:47.446 --> 20:50.314
I remember he passed out
when I had my ears pierced.

20:50.383 --> 20:52.649
- You better attend to him.
  - Yeah.

20:52.718 --> 20:55.786
You better attend to him, and we
can take this all over tomorrow.

20:55.855 --> 20:57.654
- Just relax, little buddy.
  - Perfectly alright.

20:57.723 --> 21:00.157
Now Skipper, will you administer
the anesthetic, please?

21:00.225 --> 21:01.458
Certainly.

21:01.527 --> 21:03.727
Gilligan, count backwards
   from a 100.

21:03.796 --> 21:10.434
100, 99, 98, 97, 96, 90, uh..

21:10.503 --> 21:15.739
- 95.
         - 95, 94, 93.

21:15.808 --> 21:21.011
73, 72, 71.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.813
- Scalpel.
           - Scalpel.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.352
- Sponge.
           - Sponge.

21:29.688 --> 21:31.221
65.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.591
- My book.
          - The book.

21:35.394 --> 21:38.396
[muttering indistinctly]

21:46.872 --> 21:48.306
[exhales]

21:52.144 --> 21:54.512
Hey, Skipper,
                what time is it?

21:58.484 --> 21:59.983
Gilligan.

22:00.052 --> 22:03.854
It's a minute and a half later
than the last time you asked me.

22:05.390 --> 22:06.723
Skipper, you realize.

22:06.792 --> 22:09.025
At 10 o'clock today,
            that'll be five days

22:09.094 --> 22:11.094
and the professor will take
     the bandage off.

22:11.163 --> 22:12.729
I know.

22:12.798 --> 22:14.432
Uh.

22:19.471 --> 22:21.972
Skipper, what time is it?

22:25.845 --> 22:27.844
Let's get up and go
             see the Professor.

22:27.913 --> 22:30.246
Maybe he'll give you
  an hour off for good behavior.

22:30.315 --> 22:31.682
Yes.

22:31.750 --> 22:34.518
- Can hardly wait.
  - Just hold still a minute.

22:35.821 --> 22:37.521
(Gilligan)
            Hurry, hurry, hurry.

22:41.326 --> 22:43.160
[all exclaim]
         Ah!

22:43.228 --> 22:44.261
- Beautiful.
          - Marvelous.

22:44.330 --> 22:47.097
- Perfect.
    - Lemme see. Lemme see.

22:47.166 --> 22:48.866
I don't understand.

22:50.736 --> 22:53.804
I-it's my old nose.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.873
I tried to tell you
      it wasn't broken.

22:55.941 --> 22:58.676
Wait until the swelling reduced.
You were too upset to wait.

22:58.744 --> 23:00.744
We just pretended
     to give you that operation.

23:00.812 --> 23:02.913
While you slept, the professor
  put a bandage on

23:02.982 --> 23:03.947
so it would heal.

23:04.016 --> 23:05.883
- Ah.
   - You sound disappointed.

23:05.951 --> 23:09.953
Well, naturally. I was expecting
Richard Burton.

23:10.022 --> 23:11.589
And I got me.

23:23.669 --> 23:24.601
Your driver, Mr. Howell.

23:24.670 --> 23:26.503
Thank you, boy.
        Stand aside.

23:26.572 --> 23:28.506
Alright, Captain. Here you are.

23:37.282 --> 23:40.984
Ah. Not bad, not bad at all.
  Let's see you try, Skipper.

23:41.053 --> 23:42.752
Watch this.

23:42.821 --> 23:46.156
- Your ball, Skipper.
  - Thanks so much, Gilligan.

23:46.225 --> 23:47.691
Keep your eye on this one.

23:47.759 --> 23:49.894
Load of warning here, eh.

23:51.964 --> 23:55.199
- Where did it go?
- Oh. It's right there, Skipper.

23:57.303 --> 23:59.837
- Maybe you need a bigger ball.
- Thanks, Gilligan.

23:59.905 --> 24:02.105
No, Skipper, please.
Let me give you the lesson.

24:02.174 --> 24:03.507
I know you're a big fellow

24:03.576 --> 24:06.109
and you've lot of muscles,
      strong baby feet.

24:06.178 --> 24:09.013
Just swing. Remember, it's
     with the wrist and the arm.

24:09.081 --> 24:11.614
Away we go. This time, way back,
big back swing.

24:11.683 --> 24:12.916
(Professor)
          'Oh.'

24:12.985 --> 24:15.419
(Gilligan)
  'Oh, no, right in the nose.'

24:15.488 --> 24:17.655
My poor little buddy.

24:20.393 --> 24:21.926
Sorry, professor.

24:21.994 --> 24:24.027
Mr. Howell was teaching me
   a proper back swing.

24:24.096 --> 24:26.029
- Did I hurt you?
       - I don't know.

24:26.098 --> 24:28.666
I just came over
       to join the game.

24:30.435 --> 24:32.936
Professor, don't you worry.
     I know just what to do.

24:33.005 --> 24:35.105
- Does it hurt there?
     - Ah!

24:35.174 --> 24:36.974
Doctor Gilligan to surgery.
     Doctor Gilligan to surgery.

24:48.788 --> 24:50.087
¶ Now this is the tale
     of the castaways ¶

24:50.156 --> 24:51.788
¶ They're here
    for a long, long time ¶

24:51.857 --> 24:54.457
¶ They'll have to make
     the best of things ¶

24:54.526 --> 24:56.126
¶ It's an uphill climb ¶

24:56.195 --> 24:58.328
¶ The first mate
     and his Skipper too ¶

24:58.397 --> 25:00.531
¶ Will do their very best ¶

25:00.599 --> 25:02.532
¶ To make the others
      comfortable ¶

25:02.601 --> 25:04.701
¶ In the tropic island nest ¶

25:04.770 --> 25:06.903
¶ No phone, no lights,
     no motorcars ¶

25:06.972 --> 25:09.239
¶ Not a single luxury ¶

25:09.308 --> 25:11.441
¶ Like Robinson Crusoe ¶

25:11.510 --> 25:13.310
¶ It's primitive as can be ¶

25:13.378 --> 25:15.612
¶ So join us here
     each week my friends ¶

25:15.681 --> 25:17.881
¶ You're sure to get a smile ¶

25:17.950 --> 25:20.350
¶ From seven stranded
      castaways ¶

25:20.419 --> 25:22.152
¶ Here on Gilligan's isle ¶
