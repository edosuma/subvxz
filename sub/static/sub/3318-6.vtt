00:03.737 --> 00:05.304
Nostradamus:
<i>Since mary, queen of scotland,</i>

00:05.306 --> 00:08.273
<i>Was a child,</i>

00:08.275 --> 00:11.577
<i>The english have wanted</i>
<i>her country and her crown.</i>

00:13.279 --> 00:16.181
<i>She is sent to France</i>
<i>to wed its next king,</i>

00:16.183 --> 00:17.783
To save herself and her people,

00:17.785 --> 00:21.286
A bond that should protect her.

00:21.288 --> 00:23.655
<i>But there are forces</i>
<i>that conspire--</i>

00:23.657 --> 00:25.524
<i>Forces of darkness,</i>

00:25.526 --> 00:27.493
<i>Forces of the heart.</i>

00:27.495 --> 00:31.230
<i>Long may she reign.</i>

00:31.232 --> 00:33.198
<i>Previously on</i> reign...
He heard them talk of a creature

00:33.200 --> 00:34.800
<i>Who resides in the woods.</i>

00:34.802 --> 00:36.268
<i>They give it blood.</i>

00:36.270 --> 00:37.603
<i>You have interrupted</i>
<i>a sacrifice,</i>

00:37.605 --> 00:39.204
Which they will not
take kindly to.

00:39.206 --> 00:40.706
It's olivia d'amencourt.
She left

00:40.708 --> 00:41.707
A few months
before you arrived.

00:41.709 --> 00:42.808
Brokenhearted?

00:42.810 --> 00:45.044
Yes. He was.

00:45.046 --> 00:48.313
You want me to marry francis?
You don't even like me.

00:48.315 --> 00:50.249
I like you more than a queen
I can't control.

00:50.251 --> 00:53.052
You know much less about
francis' desires than I do.

00:53.054 --> 00:54.386
Mary:
<i>Has something happened</i>
<i>between you two?</i>

00:54.388 --> 00:55.220
I stopped it.

00:55.222 --> 00:56.221
I want her gone.

00:56.223 --> 00:57.322
I'm working on it.
Now!

00:57.324 --> 00:58.624
I want her gone now!
Mary!

00:58.626 --> 01:00.259
She's staying and that's final.

01:00.261 --> 01:01.393
And francis has you.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.796
Why would he ever
look elsewhere?

01:10.404 --> 01:14.740
You're a monster,
you know.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.341
You owe a debt.

01:16.343 --> 01:18.343
And you will pay.

01:18.345 --> 01:21.580
Choose someone to sacrifice.

01:21.582 --> 01:25.184
And what if I refuse?

01:25.186 --> 01:27.586
Then we will
choose for you.

01:27.588 --> 01:28.587
No!

01:28.589 --> 01:31.256
(panting)

01:45.805 --> 01:48.207
(indistinct chatter)
olivia: Francis!

01:48.209 --> 01:49.508
Excuse me.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.743
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

01:51.745 --> 01:53.345
Where were you hurrying to?

01:53.347 --> 01:54.680
My father's returning
from paris.

01:54.682 --> 01:56.281
His carriage is arriving.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.283
May I join you?
Please.

01:58.285 --> 01:59.284
(laughs)

01:59.286 --> 02:01.286
How are you?

02:01.288 --> 02:02.888
I've barely
seen you lately.

02:02.890 --> 02:05.657
Whenever my father's away,
courtiers swarm me.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.493
Seeking approval
of the next king,

02:07.495 --> 02:09.428
In case the current
one doesn't return.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.430
And that awful business
with the butcher boy.

02:11.432 --> 02:13.198
Yes, yes.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.366
We're trying to
find his family,

02:14.368 --> 02:16.435
To return his effects.

02:16.437 --> 02:19.138
That's not why
I've barely seen you.

02:19.140 --> 02:22.441
Are you feeling bad
about the moments we shared?

02:22.443 --> 02:25.577
I felt I had to be honest
with you about my feelings.

02:25.579 --> 02:28.313
I appreciated
your honesty.

02:28.315 --> 02:31.283
I could use more of the same
from others in my life.

02:31.285 --> 02:34.286
If she's to be your wife,
you need to trust her.

02:34.288 --> 02:35.888
I hope that I can.

02:35.890 --> 02:39.291
Right now the burden is
on mary, not me.

02:39.293 --> 02:41.593
That sounds complicated.

02:44.464 --> 02:47.566
If you're ever yearning for
someone you can be sure of...

02:49.402 --> 02:51.870
...Someone who wants only you,

02:51.872 --> 02:54.573
You know where to find me.

03:06.819 --> 03:08.387
Well?

03:08.389 --> 03:09.788
I'm doing my best.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.523
How difficult can it be
for a girl like you

03:11.525 --> 03:12.891
To get a man into bed?

03:12.893 --> 03:14.560
His feelings are for mary.

03:14.562 --> 03:17.362
Do you want
your reputation cleaned up?

03:17.364 --> 03:19.831
Do you want a big wedding and
children to silence forever

03:19.833 --> 03:22.201
Those who call you "whore"
behind your back?

03:22.203 --> 03:23.702
Then make yourself
the next queen of France.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.771
"feelings"? Honestly.

03:28.408 --> 03:29.875
Mary:
Join us, kenna.

03:29.877 --> 03:32.544
We're going to greet the king.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.746
You look especially
lovely, kenna.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.848
Who are you dressed
to impress?

03:36.850 --> 03:39.284
No one. I'm just...

03:39.286 --> 03:42.354
Can't kenna be lovely simply
because she is lovely?

03:42.356 --> 03:44.423
And you are lovely.

03:45.658 --> 03:47.693
That was kind of you.

03:47.695 --> 03:50.395
I plan to tell them
about the king and me.

03:50.397 --> 03:51.830
But you want to wait.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.365
You haven't seen him
in a while.

03:53.367 --> 03:54.399
I understand.

03:54.401 --> 03:57.469
He was saying
good-bye to diane.

03:57.471 --> 03:59.671
He ended things
with her for me.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.974
I only ask
that you be careful.

04:01.976 --> 04:04.009
The king's heart
seems mercurial.

04:04.011 --> 04:06.478
And you still have
the queen to contend with.

04:06.480 --> 04:09.481
And I only ask you that
not assume I'm a fool.

04:18.424 --> 04:20.025
I was hoping
we needn't discuss this.

04:20.027 --> 04:22.928
But clearly we do.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.863
That kiss...

04:24.865 --> 04:26.665
I remember it.

04:26.667 --> 04:29.468
I was a bit drunk, and you
were, too, weren't you?

04:29.470 --> 04:31.470
Would you like me to share
in your remorse?

04:31.472 --> 04:32.938
Would that make you feel better?

04:32.940 --> 04:35.440
Yes, it would.

04:36.809 --> 04:39.478
I regret that you are engaged
to my brother.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.780
A brother I consider my friend.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.815
And who thankfully doesn't
know what happened.

04:43.817 --> 04:46.718
Still, he's been distant
since we argued.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.654
And I want to make
things up with him.

04:48.656 --> 04:49.855
I have to.

04:49.857 --> 04:51.356
You understand, don't you?

04:51.358 --> 04:53.492
Of course.
What I don't understand is

04:53.494 --> 04:55.827
Why we're still talking
about this.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.729
Because of your gift.

04:58.798 --> 05:00.399
The necklace.

05:00.401 --> 05:01.400
What necklace?

05:01.402 --> 05:03.869
Oh.

05:03.871 --> 05:06.505
I assumed, I thought...

05:06.507 --> 05:08.707
It was in my rooms
this morning.

05:08.709 --> 05:11.410
You think I snuck
into your room?

05:11.412 --> 05:13.645
Well, I didn't know what
to think after the kiss

05:13.647 --> 05:15.647
And-and my argument
with your brother.

05:20.453 --> 05:22.554
What?

05:22.556 --> 05:23.755
What is it?

05:23.757 --> 05:25.724
I've, uh,

05:25.726 --> 05:26.825
Seen this necklace before.

05:28.594 --> 05:30.662
Excuse me.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.497
Mary.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.366
Francis.

05:34.368 --> 05:35.434
Are you well?

05:36.769 --> 05:38.637
I'm fine. Thank you.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.072
I'm not.

05:40.074 --> 05:42.074
I've been feeling awful.

05:42.076 --> 05:44.509
I feel like you're still angry
at me about our argument.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.812
About olivia. I'm sorry.

05:46.814 --> 05:48.513
Is that what you're sorry about?

05:48.515 --> 05:49.915
(horse neighing nearby)

06:13.606 --> 06:15.941
(short laugh)

06:29.722 --> 06:31.923
He said he was leaving her.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.825
I don't understand.
Why is she back here?

06:37.730 --> 06:39.998
Francis.

06:42.735 --> 06:44.803
Mary, we need to talk.

06:45.805 --> 06:46.805
It's important.

06:46.807 --> 06:49.408
Follow me.

06:49.410 --> 06:53.044
The people of this... Faith,

06:53.046 --> 06:55.614
They claim
that I owe them a debt.

06:55.616 --> 06:56.782
More than once, in their minds,

06:56.784 --> 06:58.650
I've interrupted
their blood sacrifice.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.887
The butcher boy said,

07:01.889 --> 07:03.488
If I didn't choose

07:03.490 --> 07:06.191
Someone else to sacrifice,

07:06.193 --> 07:07.893
They'd choose for me.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.661
So that's what's been going on
in the woods.

07:09.663 --> 07:10.896
Pagan sacrifice?

07:10.898 --> 07:12.631
Among other dangers, yes.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.766
And now they've chosen me?

07:14.768 --> 07:16.735
Because somehow they've got
the idea that threatening you

07:16.737 --> 07:19.504
Is a good way to get
to my brother.

07:19.506 --> 07:22.574
But that doesn't
matter now, does it?

07:22.576 --> 07:23.809
What matters
is finding out

07:23.811 --> 07:24.910
Who left this marker
in mary's chambers.

07:24.912 --> 07:27.078
What matters is her safety.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.980
I'll make sure
that there's a guard

07:28.982 --> 07:30.749
Outside your room
at all times.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.184
You need to find out exactly

07:32.186 --> 07:33.752
How serious this threat is.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.620
Ask the hunters that
you know in the woods.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.556
Talk to the guards,
nostradamus, anyone.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.724
Maybe the servants saw how the
necklace got into my rooms.

07:39.726 --> 07:41.159
I'll question them.

07:41.161 --> 07:42.527
Mary.

07:43.696 --> 07:45.664
I'm sorry.

07:49.702 --> 07:51.236
I'd never have cut
those bodies down

07:51.238 --> 07:52.704
If I'd known it
would lead to mary.

07:54.073 --> 07:56.074
I don't blame you
for cutting the bodies down.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.776
I'd have done the same thing.

07:57.778 --> 07:59.744
Then what are you
so angry about?

07:59.746 --> 08:02.981
There are too many secrets
between us, brother.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.918
Far too many.

08:12.625 --> 08:14.626
I'm sorry, your grace,
I've never seen it before.

08:14.628 --> 08:17.128
You're certain?

08:17.130 --> 08:18.630
And nobody unfamiliar
has entered my chambers?

08:18.632 --> 08:19.698
No, your grace.

08:21.667 --> 08:22.801
Ask the household servants
if they've seen

08:22.803 --> 08:23.802
Any strangers about.

08:23.804 --> 08:24.803
It's important.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.771
Yes, your grace.

08:33.279 --> 08:35.046
I'm sorry, lady kenna...

08:35.048 --> 08:36.181
Stop.

08:37.817 --> 08:39.584
You said you would
break things off with diane.

08:39.586 --> 08:41.586
I trusted you and I took you
at your word.

08:41.588 --> 08:44.556
Lady kenna, your majesty.
Oh, yes, I know.

08:44.558 --> 08:46.691
I did exactly as I promised.

08:46.693 --> 08:48.159
How can you say that?

08:48.161 --> 08:49.694
You brought her back
from paris

08:49.696 --> 08:52.197
And she stood at your side
as she always has.

08:52.199 --> 08:54.900
Come stand at my side.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.669
Please.

08:59.238 --> 09:02.541
It's been a long time
since I used that word.

09:05.811 --> 09:07.879
It's true, it's an honor
to stand beside a king.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.614
It implies something.

09:09.616 --> 09:11.750
I understand that.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.852
But...

09:13.854 --> 09:15.921
To have a king behind you.

09:15.923 --> 09:18.623
And...

09:18.625 --> 09:21.326
On his knees.

09:21.328 --> 09:23.895
♪ I'll take the easy cynicism

09:23.897 --> 09:26.164
♪ less talking, more reason...

09:26.166 --> 09:27.933
(moans)

09:27.935 --> 09:30.802
♪ I... Over you...

09:30.804 --> 09:32.837
Why is she back here?

09:32.839 --> 09:36.775
Diane's being moved
to the cottage.

09:36.777 --> 09:37.909
You...

09:37.911 --> 09:40.278
Are my mistress, lady kenna.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.846
She is my friend
and the mother of my son.

09:41.848 --> 09:42.847
The cottage?

09:42.849 --> 09:45.717
Here on the grounds?

09:45.719 --> 09:47.719
The grounds are
quite expansive.

09:47.721 --> 09:48.787
When?

09:48.789 --> 09:50.689
I don't know. Shortly.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.190
There's an architect
she employs in paris.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.125
Some renovations are required.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.161
Renovations?

09:56.163 --> 09:57.295
Yes.

09:57.297 --> 09:58.296
Well, how long will that take?

09:58.298 --> 10:00.298
Kenna.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.167
I don't know.

10:02.169 --> 10:03.868
And I don't care.

10:03.870 --> 10:05.904
And neither should you.

♪ I, I, I...

10:07.307 --> 10:10.875

10:12.946 --> 10:13.979

10:13.981 --> 10:15.680
So...

10:15.682 --> 10:18.016

10:18.018 --> 10:20.051
...Be with me.

10:22.922 --> 10:25.223
Do they really think I could
drag some innocent

10:25.225 --> 10:26.925
Into the woods
and slaughter them?

10:26.927 --> 10:28.760
Diane:
Could you?
To save yourself?

10:28.762 --> 10:29.928
No.

10:29.930 --> 10:32.931
But to save mary?

10:37.003 --> 10:41.006
I don't understand
how you ever worshipped
alongside these savages.

10:41.008 --> 10:43.875
I was young,
it was a different faith.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.210
We worshipped the natural world.

10:45.212 --> 10:47.312
A sacrifice was only a very
small part of it.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.880
It was not human.

10:48.882 --> 10:50.015
Do they count me

10:50.017 --> 10:51.750
One of them because of you?

10:51.752 --> 10:55.153
The larger question is
what people here in the castle

10:55.155 --> 10:56.388
Would consider you if they knew.

10:56.390 --> 10:58.890
I'm catholic.

10:58.892 --> 11:01.726
I practice my father's religion.

11:01.728 --> 11:04.162
As do you.
Have no illusions.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.931
If they learned about my past,
we would both burn as heretics.

11:06.933 --> 11:09.000
We're outsiders.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.002
You live here
at your father's will.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.103
And someday, your brother's.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.939
Do not covet his future wife.

11:14.941 --> 11:17.776
Even the laws of your chosen
faith are clear on that.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.077
Mary is in danger because of me.

11:19.079 --> 11:21.012
And francis knows that.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.280
If anything happened to her...

11:22.282 --> 11:24.983
He will blame you.

11:34.427 --> 11:36.995
So... There's my choice?

11:36.997 --> 11:40.799
Choose someone to kill...

11:40.801 --> 11:43.034
Or let them kill mary?

11:44.737 --> 11:48.339
It's only a matter of time
now that they've marked her.

11:48.341 --> 11:50.742
Pay the debt.

11:50.744 --> 11:53.778
And then harden your heart
against her.

12:00.186 --> 12:02.353
(liquid dripping)

12:18.237 --> 12:19.270
(screams)

12:29.381 --> 12:31.116
We need to get you
out of here.

12:31.118 --> 12:33.151
They must have drugged me.

12:33.153 --> 12:37.422
There's no other way
I-I would sleep through this.

12:37.424 --> 12:40.125
My head feels as heavy
as that stag's.

12:40.127 --> 12:41.760
Please sit down, then.

12:41.762 --> 12:43.261
Look at my hand.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.430
It looks as though
I've been burned.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.031
Where you touched
the pendant.

12:47.033 --> 12:48.466
Perhaps it was dipped
in some sort

12:48.468 --> 12:52.103
Of poisonous oil:
Sumac or ivy.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.873
How much danger am I in?

12:54.875 --> 12:56.007
I don't know,

12:56.009 --> 12:57.976
But I'm going
to find out.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.178
Bash:
Mary, are you all right?

13:00.180 --> 13:02.046
Stay here.

13:02.048 --> 13:03.815
I'll be right back.

13:13.159 --> 13:15.126
I don't know you at all.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.861
Yes, you do.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.397
This was meant to terrorize us.

13:19.399 --> 13:21.332
And motivate you.
That's why they chose mary.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.401
This horror was
not my doing.

13:23.403 --> 13:26.471
You need to remedy this.

13:28.574 --> 13:32.110
I'd do it myself, but it's you
that they want something from.

13:32.112 --> 13:34.112
You do realize what you're
asking me to do.
I don't blame

13:34.114 --> 13:37.148
You for their actions, but it's
you who brought this on mary.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.550
They're asking me
to take a life.

13:38.552 --> 13:40.351
A life; a person.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.921
To hang them
from a tree,
slit their throat,

13:42.923 --> 13:45.423
And bleed them out.
You do know that?

13:45.425 --> 13:47.358
Did you consult your experts?

13:47.360 --> 13:49.093
Whoever it is
that you know in secret?

13:49.095 --> 13:51.396
Or whatever it is
that you know in secret?

13:51.398 --> 13:52.997
(door creaks)

13:54.366 --> 13:56.367
Is there really no other way?

13:59.839 --> 14:02.874
Good lord, what is that?

14:09.515 --> 14:11.049
How could this
have happened?

14:11.051 --> 14:13.184
You've had someone break
into my room before.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.186
Why don't you tell us
how it's done?

14:15.188 --> 14:18.389
Are you accusing me of this?

14:18.391 --> 14:21.025
We're not accusing you
of any involvement, mother.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.927
Does that mean
you know who's done this?

14:22.929 --> 14:24.362
Right now,
we're less worried

14:24.364 --> 14:26.397
About who than how.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.132
They'd have to have drugged her.

14:32.504 --> 14:34.038
This is poppy.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.641
I suspect your guard
was given the same thing.

14:36.643 --> 14:38.042
Where is he?

14:38.044 --> 14:41.212
That means he drank
too much of it.

14:44.049 --> 14:45.550
A stag's head.

14:45.552 --> 14:48.186
What message is that
meant to convey?

14:50.923 --> 14:52.223
It's a symbol...

14:52.225 --> 14:54.092
Of the pagans.

14:54.094 --> 14:58.162
What do either of you know
about pagans?

14:58.164 --> 15:00.231
Only what
everyone knows:

15:00.233 --> 15:03.067
That they're becoming
bolder, more ruthless,

15:03.069 --> 15:04.969
And thirsty for blood.

15:04.971 --> 15:08.273
And it seems the more fear
they spread, the more power

15:08.275 --> 15:10.275
That they gain.

15:11.944 --> 15:16.981
These devils have come inside
our walls.

15:16.983 --> 15:19.150
Inside my home.

15:19.152 --> 15:22.654
These heretics
worked together
to threaten us.

15:22.656 --> 15:24.956
Now we must work
together to stop them.

15:43.075 --> 15:45.310
What an inviting little party.

15:45.312 --> 15:50.081
Has diane finally deigned
to acknowledge that we exist?

15:50.083 --> 15:53.251
It's not diane's gathering,
it's mine.

15:54.720 --> 15:57.622
But these are
the king's chambers.

15:57.624 --> 16:01.559
Yes, well, now they're
my chambers, too.

16:01.561 --> 16:03.261
Because we're in love.

16:03.263 --> 16:04.729
(chuckles)

16:04.731 --> 16:06.531
You were bound
to find out soon enough.

16:06.533 --> 16:09.133
I just wanted
to tell you myself.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.169
You and the king?

16:11.171 --> 16:12.537
In love?

16:12.539 --> 16:14.138
I'm the king's
official mistress.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.640
It's shocking, I know.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.709
And amazing.

16:17.711 --> 16:20.111
Kenna, it is,

16:20.113 --> 16:22.480
It's... Amazing.

16:24.216 --> 16:27.151
You all probably think
it's a horrid idea...

16:27.153 --> 16:28.453
Just like mary.

16:28.455 --> 16:32.190
Mary thinks
it's a bad idea?

16:32.192 --> 16:33.257
Why?

16:33.259 --> 16:35.226
You know mary.
Always so worried.

16:35.228 --> 16:37.128
So cautious.

16:37.130 --> 16:40.298
I suppose it's her job to worry.
It's not mine.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.166
I should say not.

16:42.168 --> 16:43.234
What's that mean?

16:43.236 --> 16:45.003
Nothing.

16:45.005 --> 16:47.238
If you're happy,
we're happy. Aren't we?

16:51.343 --> 16:52.777
So, give us the details.

16:52.779 --> 16:55.179
How did it happen?
When were you first alone

16:55.181 --> 16:57.315
With him? Has he been
courting you for a long time?

16:57.317 --> 16:59.417
It was fast.

16:59.419 --> 17:02.186
<i>Um, unexpected.</i>

17:02.188 --> 17:04.522
(gasping breaths)

17:04.524 --> 17:08.026
Greer:
<i>But you knew him well before</i>
<i>things went too far?</i>

17:08.028 --> 17:09.594
Your grace.

17:09.596 --> 17:11.062
Kenna:
<i>Very well.</i>

17:11.064 --> 17:12.363
Can you tell us anything?

17:17.136 --> 17:18.703
Does catherine know?
What does diane say?

17:18.705 --> 17:21.372
Oh, who cares what diane says?

17:21.374 --> 17:23.241
I'm the king's mistress now.

17:23.243 --> 17:26.144
Diane's the mother
of the king's favorite son.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.279
She's a fixture
at court.

17:28.281 --> 17:29.414
She's been here for...

17:29.416 --> 17:31.315
Decades, yes, I know.

17:31.317 --> 17:32.750
Too long, some might say.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.685
And now it's my turn.

17:34.687 --> 17:37.455
The king <i>can</i> move on.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.157
Kenna, that might not
be so easy.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.224
It's been easy enough
for him so far.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.326
Well, yes, I'm sure, but...

17:43.228 --> 17:46.330
Look at those tiles.

17:46.332 --> 17:49.067
"h" and "d" for henry and diane.

17:49.069 --> 17:52.837
Their love is literally
written in stone.

18:01.447 --> 18:03.614
What is this, water?

18:03.616 --> 18:05.416
I asked for mint sprigs.

18:05.418 --> 18:06.517
Most of the
castle servants

18:06.519 --> 18:08.319
Are gathered
to hear from you.

18:08.321 --> 18:10.254
Shall I send a few back
to the kitchen?

18:10.256 --> 18:12.356
Your uniform, robert.
It's a disgrace! Fix it.

18:12.358 --> 18:15.726
You may let them in now.
What are you waiting for?

18:33.178 --> 18:36.547
By now, you've all heard
what has happened:

18:36.549 --> 18:39.117
Someone who is no friend
of France

18:39.119 --> 18:41.219
Has invaded the castle
and threatened us.

18:41.221 --> 18:43.221
All of us.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.556
This was done in the name
of a faith

18:45.558 --> 18:49.327
That some of you may feel
sympathy for.

18:49.329 --> 18:54.499
Please know that we do not
judge this faith today,

18:54.501 --> 18:57.735
Only the actions that someone
has wrongly taken in its name.

18:57.737 --> 19:00.138
Queen catherine
and I cannot promise

19:00.140 --> 19:02.507
That the guilty parties
will not suffer.

19:02.509 --> 19:06.177
Only that they will suffer
more intensely

19:06.179 --> 19:08.880
If someone does not come
forward.

19:08.882 --> 19:13.684
For the sake of France,
for your king, and for peace,

19:13.686 --> 19:17.488
If you know anything,
please step forward.

19:19.258 --> 19:22.160
You will have our protection...

19:22.162 --> 19:23.728
And our thanks.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.908
None of you have
stepped forward,

19:38.610 --> 19:41.179
That must mean
that none of you knows anything.

19:41.181 --> 19:45.483
Except that isn't
possible, is it?

19:47.920 --> 19:51.589
Let me explain why
we will have an answer.

19:54.393 --> 19:58.729
People are questioning whether
they're safe in this castle.

19:58.731 --> 20:00.298
My home.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.867
That means
they're questioning me...

20:02.869 --> 20:04.669
And everyone in this room.

20:04.671 --> 20:07.471
One of you knows
who did this.

20:07.473 --> 20:09.340
And they will come forward.

20:09.342 --> 20:11.409
By midnight.

20:12.644 --> 20:14.512
If not...

20:14.514 --> 20:17.648
I will send my guards
to your villages.

20:17.650 --> 20:21.285
And burn each of your homes
to the ground.

20:28.727 --> 20:30.861
No killers on hand, my lord, if
that's what you're looking for.

20:30.863 --> 20:33.431
A baker who tried to sleep
with a nobleman's serving maid,

20:33.433 --> 20:34.532
Two drunks,

20:34.534 --> 20:36.667
And a thief from alsace.

20:36.669 --> 20:38.436
(sighs)

20:38.438 --> 20:40.705
Bring me the thief.

20:40.707 --> 20:43.407
Release samson.

20:47.846 --> 20:49.647
Don't tell anyone
I was here.

20:49.649 --> 20:50.915
Yes, my lord.

20:50.917 --> 20:54.418
Don't call me "my lord."

20:54.420 --> 20:55.553
Kenna:
They pain me.

20:55.555 --> 20:56.821
Doesn't that matter to you?

20:56.823 --> 20:58.723
Henry:
Yes, but this is my bedroom.

20:58.725 --> 20:59.590
I don't want to vacate
it for repairs

20:59.592 --> 21:00.658
Which don't need to be made.

21:00.660 --> 21:02.627
The tiles stay.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.328
Well, I can't bear
to look at them.
Then don't.

21:04.330 --> 21:06.631
I'll have them covered
with any tapestry you like.

21:06.633 --> 21:08.733
Tapestries diane's chosen.

21:08.735 --> 21:10.434
She decorated this room,

21:10.436 --> 21:11.702
Didn't she?
Oh, kenna.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.437
I'm weary of this.

21:13.439 --> 21:14.639
I'm beginning to find affairs
of state more appealing.

21:14.641 --> 21:16.340
Yes, I can't take

21:16.342 --> 21:18.009
My mind off them.
You're being ridiculous.

21:18.011 --> 21:20.678
Diane's having
a 15-bedroom cottage redone.

21:20.680 --> 21:23.648
And you won't even replace
some tiles for me?

21:23.650 --> 21:26.784
Do you stop to think
what this must be like for me?

21:26.786 --> 21:29.620
I risked everything for you.
Kenna.

21:29.622 --> 21:33.024
They're just tiles.

21:33.026 --> 21:35.726
And how many believed you
when you told them that?

21:35.728 --> 21:36.794
Where are they now?

21:36.796 --> 21:39.630
I won't be one of them.

21:39.632 --> 21:40.698
You have me.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.500
You have nothing to fear.

21:42.502 --> 21:43.701
You say that.

21:43.703 --> 21:45.970
Yes, and if you can't
trust my word,

21:45.972 --> 21:47.972
How can changing some tiles
be enough to persuade you?

21:47.974 --> 21:49.707
I don't know.

21:49.709 --> 21:51.709
But if it matters enough,
you'll find the answer.

21:55.681 --> 21:58.883
If you don't mind
my asking, my lord,

21:58.885 --> 22:00.384
Where are we going?

22:00.386 --> 22:01.752
I told you.

22:01.754 --> 22:03.921
You're being conscripted
for a military mission.

22:03.923 --> 22:06.657
Where will we meet
these other soldiers?

22:06.659 --> 22:09.393
I've fought for
the king before.

22:09.395 --> 22:11.462
Usually we gathered up
in the bailey.
This way.

22:11.464 --> 22:13.064
(horse snorts)

22:13.066 --> 22:14.799
That's blood wood.

22:14.801 --> 22:15.800
Is that where we're going?

22:15.802 --> 22:17.702
Would you rather go to jail?

22:17.704 --> 22:19.804
I might.

22:19.806 --> 22:22.106
What do you want from me?
What's going on?

22:27.045 --> 22:28.946
We're not going to meet up
with other soldiers, are we?

22:28.948 --> 22:30.648
Keep moving.

22:30.650 --> 22:31.882
Stop talking.

22:31.884 --> 22:33.951
We're almost there.

22:35.887 --> 22:38.556
Come on.
(horse neighing, snorting)

22:40.826 --> 22:43.627
Where's mary?

22:43.629 --> 22:45.730
I don't know.

22:45.732 --> 22:47.465
The last I saw her, she was
questioning the staff

22:47.467 --> 22:48.899
With the queen.

22:48.901 --> 22:50.534
I'm sure she'll
be here soon.

22:50.536 --> 22:52.970
Who'd want to miss this?

22:52.972 --> 22:54.905
I suppose the king wants
our minds off our troubles.

22:54.907 --> 22:57.508
Kenna:
I wish I could get
my mind off him.

22:57.510 --> 22:59.810
Did I go too far?

22:59.812 --> 23:02.546
Demanding that he
tear out a handful of tiles.

23:02.548 --> 23:05.449
Where is the king now?

23:05.451 --> 23:07.818
He said I mustn't
miss the fireworks.

23:07.820 --> 23:10.154
Of course he wouldn't say
why he couldn't join me.

23:10.156 --> 23:11.856
Was he trying to
get rid of me

23:11.858 --> 23:13.524
So he could have a moment
alone with diane?

23:13.526 --> 23:15.559
Is there some other mistress
that he's courting?

23:15.561 --> 23:17.762
God knows I've been trying
his patience lately.

23:17.764 --> 23:19.797
Kenna, shut up.
I'm sorry!

23:19.799 --> 23:21.532
God, no wonder he can't
stand me anymore.

23:21.534 --> 23:24.802
No, shut up and look.

23:26.872 --> 23:28.005
(gasps)

23:28.007 --> 23:29.707
(laughs)

23:29.709 --> 23:32.777
♪ yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

23:32.779 --> 23:36.514
♪ yeah, yeah

23:40.719 --> 23:43.454
♪ yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

23:43.456 --> 23:45.956
♪ yeah, yeah.

23:47.959 --> 23:49.760
You're missing
the fireworks.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.195
So are you.

23:51.197 --> 23:52.630
Most of the household staff

23:52.632 --> 23:53.631
Has been interviewed.

23:53.633 --> 23:54.832
We caught a groom in a lie,

23:54.834 --> 23:57.935
But it led nowhere.

23:57.937 --> 23:59.570
Has bash learned anything?

23:59.572 --> 24:00.771
He said he was
going to question

24:00.773 --> 24:01.772
The seriousness
of the threat.

24:01.774 --> 24:02.873
He knows how serious it is.

24:02.875 --> 24:04.575
I've been doing
some questioning

24:04.577 --> 24:05.876
Of my own, and do you know
what I've learned?

24:05.878 --> 24:07.044
No, tell me.

24:07.046 --> 24:08.679
That bash used his position,
and money

24:08.681 --> 24:10.648
To take a prisoner
from the castle jails.

24:10.650 --> 24:12.883
A prisoner he warned
would not be returning.

24:12.885 --> 24:14.652
A thief.

24:14.654 --> 24:16.587
And I can guarantee you that
that thief does not deserve

24:16.589 --> 24:18.823
To be strung up in the woods
and slaughtered like an animal.

24:18.825 --> 24:21.058
And bash does not deserve
to be the one to do it.

24:21.060 --> 24:22.860
Is that what it means
to pay the debt?

24:22.862 --> 24:24.929
Human sacrifice?

24:26.898 --> 24:28.566
Bash wouldn't do it.
I think he would.

24:28.568 --> 24:30.201
For you.

24:31.770 --> 24:33.170
And I can't say
that I don't want him to.

24:33.172 --> 24:34.672
Because I care for you as well.

24:34.674 --> 24:36.907
I knew that my brother
had feelings

24:36.909 --> 24:37.875
For you, I just...

24:37.877 --> 24:39.009
Had no idea how deep they ran.

24:39.011 --> 24:40.978
You needn't worry about that.

24:43.048 --> 24:45.516
But there is something
I should tell you.

24:45.518 --> 24:47.151
If you mean to tell me that
you've been in his arms,

24:47.153 --> 24:48.886
You needn't bother.

24:48.888 --> 24:50.588
I saw you.

24:50.590 --> 24:53.057
I saw you both.

24:53.059 --> 24:56.227
It was a mistake,
I wasn't thinking, and he...

24:56.229 --> 24:57.261
He what?

24:57.263 --> 24:59.597
Forgot that he was my brother?

24:59.599 --> 25:01.966
Forgot that you were my fiancée?

25:03.802 --> 25:07.137
I know that I've made
mistakes with olivia.

25:07.139 --> 25:09.139
Seems like the biggest mistake
that I made

25:09.141 --> 25:10.841
Was being completely
honest with you.

25:10.843 --> 25:12.076
I've been nothing but
since you returned,

25:12.078 --> 25:13.677
And each time
I've paid the price.

25:13.679 --> 25:14.912
Well, tonight,

25:14.914 --> 25:16.280
Bash is paying the price
as well.

25:16.282 --> 25:18.616
I didn't realize...

25:18.618 --> 25:21.552
I've warned you of the stakes
of life at court.

25:21.554 --> 25:24.622
I told you that we can't act
on whim, on feeling.

25:24.624 --> 25:25.956
You didn't listen.

25:25.958 --> 25:27.157
I did!

25:27.159 --> 25:30.694
Then why are we here now?

25:30.696 --> 25:32.997
And who will my brother be
when he returns?

25:43.675 --> 25:45.175
I wonder if henry's cheap

25:45.177 --> 25:48.012
Display of affection works.

25:48.014 --> 25:51.882
If the melted candles pleased

25:51.884 --> 25:53.183
His young mistress.

25:53.185 --> 25:55.886
Maybe the fireworks
had unintended benefits

25:55.888 --> 25:58.155
Of frightening
the heathens in the woods.

25:58.157 --> 26:00.124
Do you think they fear fire?

26:00.126 --> 26:01.892
Those pagans?

26:01.894 --> 26:04.962
I couldn't say,
your majesty.

26:04.964 --> 26:07.932
They should.

26:07.934 --> 26:10.200
(knocking)

26:12.804 --> 26:13.938
Woman: May I have a
word with her majesty?

26:13.940 --> 26:15.906
This one claims
she has information.

26:15.908 --> 26:18.876
Hmm.

26:18.878 --> 26:20.611
Y-your highness.

26:20.613 --> 26:23.013
I know it's late, but...

26:23.015 --> 26:24.915
You realized the time,
and you knew your house

26:24.917 --> 26:27.985
Was about to burn down.
I understand why you're here.

26:27.987 --> 26:29.353
Yes, your grace.

26:31.623 --> 26:33.624
Well, out with it then.

26:33.626 --> 26:35.092
Contrary to public opinion,

26:35.094 --> 26:37.161
I do not relish
destroying people's homes.

26:42.067 --> 26:45.069
I believe the girl was hoping
for some confidentiality.

26:45.071 --> 26:47.871
Wait just outside,
if you please.

26:47.873 --> 26:50.007
I'll call if I need anything.

26:55.947 --> 26:58.349
You'd better have more
than mere gossip.

26:58.351 --> 26:59.950
You already have my suspicion

26:59.952 --> 27:02.386
For waiting so long.

27:02.388 --> 27:04.755
My father always told me

27:04.757 --> 27:06.357
That to stick your neck in

27:06.359 --> 27:08.692
Was to see your neck cut.

27:08.694 --> 27:11.362
Well.
And...

27:11.364 --> 27:13.330
Though I saw one of your guards

27:13.332 --> 27:15.065
Take that stag's head,

27:15.067 --> 27:17.101
I didn't see his face...
Was it one of my guards?

27:17.103 --> 27:18.936
Yes.

27:18.938 --> 27:20.638
I could tell by his uniform.

27:20.640 --> 27:23.974
He came in for scraps
as they often do.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.809
He didn't think
anyone saw him.

27:25.811 --> 27:28.979
And he-he's a guard,
I wasn't about to stop him.

27:28.981 --> 27:31.115
You stick your
neck in and...

27:31.117 --> 27:34.051
Yes, we've already covered that.

27:34.053 --> 27:36.120
I have nearly a hundred guards.

27:36.122 --> 27:39.823
Did you notice anything
about him, anything at all?

27:39.825 --> 27:41.358
He was covered in blood.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.794
Once he had that
thing in his grasp.

27:43.796 --> 27:45.663
I can tell you that.

27:45.665 --> 27:48.766
You didn't see no
blood on anyone?

27:48.768 --> 27:51.935
No, I didn't see
a guard drenched in blood.

27:51.937 --> 27:54.204
If he'd a brain,
he'd have changed.

27:55.974 --> 27:59.009
He would have changed.

27:59.011 --> 28:01.145
But a guard has
only one uniform.

28:01.147 --> 28:03.714
Another's would be
ill-fitting, unkempt.

28:07.118 --> 28:09.053
My guard robert,
where did he go?

28:09.055 --> 28:10.187
He left, your highness.
He said you dismissed him.

28:10.189 --> 28:11.755
Well, I didn't.

28:11.757 --> 28:13.757
He's responsible
for the stag's head

28:13.759 --> 28:15.459
Placed in the queen
of scotland's room.

28:15.461 --> 28:17.061
He's a heretic! Find him.

28:17.063 --> 28:19.363
Now!

28:22.033 --> 28:23.801
What are you gonna do to me?

28:29.040 --> 28:31.041
(grunts)

28:31.043 --> 28:33.210
Tie it around your feet.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.245
My feet?

28:37.048 --> 28:39.316
Are you one
of those devils of the woods?

28:39.318 --> 28:42.119
The ones who-who
spill blood?

28:42.121 --> 28:45.189
I said tie your feet.

28:45.191 --> 28:47.091
And stop talking.

28:47.093 --> 28:48.959
Please.

28:48.961 --> 28:50.861
Stop begging.

28:50.863 --> 28:53.330
Say your prayers.
You have time.

28:53.332 --> 28:54.765
Time? Time for what?

28:54.767 --> 28:55.899
I need an audience.

28:55.901 --> 28:58.068
Or all this will be for naught.

28:58.070 --> 29:01.805
I only stole the money
to feed my family.

29:01.807 --> 29:04.475
Maybe I deserve to lose
a hand, but not-not-not this!

29:04.477 --> 29:06.877
My little girl,
she's only three.

29:06.879 --> 29:09.980
She needs her father
to look after her.

29:09.982 --> 29:12.516
We all have people
to look after.

29:12.518 --> 29:14.885
(rustling nearby)

29:14.887 --> 29:16.220
Oh, please, don't do this!

29:16.222 --> 29:17.154
(crying):
Oh, no!

29:17.156 --> 29:20.357
Don't... (yelling)

29:23.228 --> 29:25.496
Please release me!

29:25.498 --> 29:28.966
Silence or I will peel you
before I slice you.

29:28.968 --> 29:31.235
I don't deserve this!

29:31.237 --> 29:33.203
Oh, god!

29:33.205 --> 29:35.239
No!

29:35.241 --> 29:37.908
You've threatened
someone very close to me.

29:37.910 --> 29:39.376
Now, I need to know.

29:39.378 --> 29:42.446
If I kill someone, anyone,

29:42.448 --> 29:44.281
Even someone
as wretched as this,

29:44.283 --> 29:47.217
My debt will be paid.

29:47.219 --> 29:49.086
The conditions are simple.

29:49.088 --> 29:52.923
Make the choice and the
offering, any human offering,

29:52.925 --> 29:55.192
And your debt is paid.

29:55.194 --> 29:57.961
Then I choose you.

30:06.337 --> 30:08.939
Don't pretend this faith

30:08.941 --> 30:10.474
Is so strange to you.

30:10.476 --> 30:14.344
You're betraying your family,
bastard-born or not.

30:14.346 --> 30:15.145
Shut up!

30:15.147 --> 30:18.949
(both grunting)

30:18.951 --> 30:22.553
It's not just the king's
blood in your veins.

30:22.555 --> 30:25.322
Your mother's blood
is our blood.

30:31.296 --> 30:33.330
(grunting)

30:37.936 --> 30:40.304
(gasping)

30:41.573 --> 30:43.106
I think you're ignorant,

30:43.108 --> 30:47.344
I think the bloodlust is in you.

30:47.346 --> 30:49.246
(gasps)

30:49.248 --> 30:52.382
Now it's in you.

31:08.066 --> 31:09.266
Oh, please.

31:11.469 --> 31:14.972
(door opens)

31:14.974 --> 31:16.974
I know that frown.

31:16.976 --> 31:19.509
I see the same on you.

31:19.511 --> 31:21.445
Are you not
happy to see me?

31:21.447 --> 31:23.146
Yes.

31:23.148 --> 31:25.082
Of course.

31:25.084 --> 31:27.251
I was thinking about our son.

31:27.253 --> 31:29.553
I'm sure it's not easy
on him to see you displaced.

31:29.555 --> 31:31.288
It's not the first time.

31:31.290 --> 31:34.091
I feel displaced
as well.

31:35.560 --> 31:38.328
She wants to... Change things.

31:38.330 --> 31:41.031
There's workers in my bedroom.
Dust and noise.

31:41.033 --> 31:43.901
How long will the work take
on the cottage, hmm?

31:43.903 --> 31:45.502
You don't need
to worry about it.

31:45.504 --> 31:47.004
I'll take care of it all.

31:47.006 --> 31:49.907
Why can't she do that?

31:49.909 --> 31:53.210
Fix things without bothering me?

31:53.212 --> 31:55.545
She's very young.

31:55.547 --> 31:57.214
Perhaps she'll learn.

31:57.216 --> 31:59.216
(scoffs)
when will I learn?

31:59.218 --> 32:01.351
I don't care
what you learn.

32:03.288 --> 32:07.357
As long as you
don't forget.

32:07.359 --> 32:09.593
Not with you
to remind me.

32:09.595 --> 32:11.495
(chuckles)

32:16.301 --> 32:18.969
Has sebastian returned?

32:18.971 --> 32:20.570
Sarah:
Not yet.

32:20.572 --> 32:23.273
And you told his servant
to bring word immediately?

32:23.275 --> 32:28.178
I did.
My lady, you need to rest.

32:28.180 --> 32:32.382
Yes, fear is exhausting.

32:32.384 --> 32:35.118
That guard will be caught
before dawn,

32:35.120 --> 32:37.454
But I wish I knew bash
had returned

32:37.456 --> 32:43.026
Without harm to himself or...

32:43.028 --> 32:45.495
Come and sit with me, sarah.

32:46.998 --> 32:49.399
Tell me something about yourself
I don't know.

32:49.401 --> 32:52.302
There must be some story you'd
find more diverting than mine.

32:52.304 --> 32:55.005
Some fairy tale maybe?

32:55.007 --> 32:57.307
One with a happy ending.

32:57.309 --> 32:59.209
Shall I return
that for you?

33:02.747 --> 33:04.514
You lied.

33:05.450 --> 33:08.085
You said that you had
never seen the necklace,

33:08.087 --> 33:10.220
But you're the one
who put it on my pillow.

33:10.222 --> 33:12.422
Guards!
Don't bother.
If the king's bastard

33:12.424 --> 33:15.125
Fails again
to pay his debt,
he'll need to learn.

33:15.127 --> 33:16.393
How many of you are there?

33:16.395 --> 33:18.395
Enough.

33:18.397 --> 33:21.231
Sarah, you'll burn for this!
All of you.

33:21.233 --> 33:22.065
Guards!

33:24.235 --> 33:27.037
(screams)
jackal, let me go!

33:43.654 --> 33:46.089
Samson:
In the end,
you did nothing wrong.

33:46.091 --> 33:48.258
Though I wish I'd known
what you were planning.

33:48.260 --> 33:49.559
Better that you didn't.

33:49.561 --> 33:51.194
More convincing,
I suppose.

33:51.196 --> 33:52.729
Lord knows
you convinced me.

33:52.731 --> 33:54.731
I'd have done the same,
in your position.

33:54.733 --> 33:56.800
Anything it takes
to protect someone I love.

33:56.802 --> 34:01.104
But now you don't need
to do a thing more.

34:01.106 --> 34:03.106
What else would
I do, exactly?

34:03.108 --> 34:05.208
After my debt was paid?

34:05.210 --> 34:06.643
Nothing.

34:06.645 --> 34:08.678
You think I still
mean you harm?

34:08.680 --> 34:10.080
Why would that be?

34:10.082 --> 34:11.515
All I meant was...

34:11.517 --> 34:13.717
You don't pick
your family or their faith.

34:13.719 --> 34:16.353
And it doesn't matter
whose blood flows
through your veins.

34:16.355 --> 34:18.722
You choose your own path.
Or your king will.

34:18.724 --> 34:21.725
I come from a town
where it's better
to be a protestant.

34:21.727 --> 34:24.528
But now, being so close
to the king, I'm catholic.

34:24.530 --> 34:27.064
Declared.
Devout, even.

34:27.066 --> 34:29.399
How close do you think
I am to the king?

34:29.401 --> 34:33.070
Do you know who I am?
No.

34:33.072 --> 34:36.540
You think I once shared
the faith of those savages,

34:36.542 --> 34:37.607
That it was mine?

34:37.609 --> 34:39.376
No.
Mine and my family's?

34:39.378 --> 34:42.112
The family I couldn't pick.

34:45.450 --> 34:48.085
I don't want anything,
I swear.

34:48.087 --> 34:49.753
You're the king's bastard.

34:49.755 --> 34:52.422
And my mother is?

34:52.424 --> 34:56.693
Diane de poitiers.

34:57.595 --> 34:59.663
(screams)

35:08.840 --> 35:11.508
Francis:
Are you all right?

35:11.510 --> 35:13.243
Were you hurt?

35:13.245 --> 35:15.245
I'm fine.

35:15.247 --> 35:17.347
Have they caught
your mother's guard?

35:17.349 --> 35:19.616
Robert was caught fleeing
through the blood wood.

35:19.618 --> 35:22.719
Now he's down in
the jails with your maid.

35:22.721 --> 35:26.456
They'll be questioned...
Until they are burned.

35:29.660 --> 35:33.163
It's done.
The debt's been paid.

35:33.165 --> 35:34.865
You're safe now.

35:34.867 --> 35:36.900
Bash, what did you do?

35:36.902 --> 35:39.536
Tell me.

35:39.538 --> 35:42.606
I'm sure it was more than you
thought you were capable of.

35:43.574 --> 35:44.875
If we're finished...

35:44.877 --> 35:45.642
We're not.

35:47.745 --> 35:50.447
You were both in terrible danger

35:50.449 --> 35:52.516
Because of what you
mean to each other...

35:52.518 --> 35:54.417
And what that meant to me.

35:54.419 --> 35:57.420
For a moment,
more than one,
I thought

35:57.422 --> 35:59.422
You deserved
to die for what you did.

35:59.424 --> 36:01.691
Not by my hand,

36:01.693 --> 36:03.927
But in the wood.

36:03.929 --> 36:07.164
That if it happened, you'd have
brought it on yourself.

36:07.166 --> 36:10.767
But it could be at my hand.
We both know it.

36:10.769 --> 36:12.469
I'm going to be king someday.

36:12.471 --> 36:13.570
Mary is already
a queen.

36:13.572 --> 36:15.472
We are rulers.

36:15.474 --> 36:21.211
We need to lead with a clear
head and compassion.

36:21.213 --> 36:22.812
We've too much power
to let anger

36:22.814 --> 36:24.748
And jealousy cloud
our judgment.

36:24.750 --> 36:26.449
And our situation...

36:26.451 --> 36:27.851
Well, it lets others
get between us.

36:27.853 --> 36:30.854
Not if we swear to be
true to one another.

36:30.856 --> 36:32.389
Not if we promise.

36:32.391 --> 36:34.391
What is an engagement
but a promise?

36:34.393 --> 36:36.393
And it means nothing.

36:36.395 --> 36:39.296
Because unless it makes sense
for France, I can't marry you.

36:39.298 --> 36:40.830
And if a better option
arises for scotland,

36:40.832 --> 36:42.933
You need to take it.
It is your duty.

36:42.935 --> 36:44.568
What are you saying?

36:46.537 --> 36:49.573
We have positioned ourselves
for the worst sort of pain.

36:50.641 --> 36:52.976
When it is right
for France,

36:52.978 --> 36:55.712
Should you agree,

36:55.714 --> 36:59.683
I will be by your side,
fully committed.

36:59.685 --> 37:01.585
Until then...

37:01.587 --> 37:05.422
You can spend your time
with others.

37:05.424 --> 37:07.290
I have to accept that.

37:09.427 --> 37:10.727
You mean I do.

37:12.563 --> 37:14.231
Is this really about olivia?

37:14.233 --> 37:16.666
Someone needs to take control
of things between us.

37:18.336 --> 37:19.936
I can do it.

37:19.938 --> 37:23.406
I can keep my distance.

37:23.408 --> 37:26.409
Even if it means releasing you
to another.

37:27.645 --> 37:31.548
Anyone... But not my brother.

37:32.717 --> 37:35.352
Is that a warning,
little brother?

37:38.356 --> 37:39.623
Yes, it is.

38:04.882 --> 38:07.484
I can't promise
you anything.

38:23.768 --> 38:26.736
You can't burn the truth,
or him!

38:26.738 --> 38:29.005
He is sent by the true gods.

38:29.007 --> 38:31.041
Defy him,
and he will come for you!

38:31.043 --> 38:33.443
For your last drop of blood.

38:33.445 --> 38:34.978
Your sons and daughters, too!

38:38.616 --> 38:40.517
(sobbing)

38:41.686 --> 38:43.553
(screaming)

38:46.490 --> 38:48.024
Aylee:
Mary, you can't
watch this.

38:48.026 --> 38:52.095
I begged them to offer her
the mercy of a quick death

38:52.097 --> 38:53.763
Before they put her on the pyre.

38:53.765 --> 38:55.799
(couple screaming,
arrow releases)

38:55.801 --> 38:56.900
(man screaming)

38:56.902 --> 39:01.738
They put an arrow
in her, then.

39:01.740 --> 39:04.874
They're not who
we thought they were.

39:09.747 --> 39:11.848
He threatened
my life tonight.

39:11.850 --> 39:13.950
The blood priest?

39:13.952 --> 39:16.986
I was speaking of francis.

39:16.988 --> 39:20.657
Trying to rule his heart
by ruling mine.

39:20.659 --> 39:22.592
We're not safe here.

39:22.594 --> 39:25.695
You have to heed
your brother's warning
about mary.

39:25.697 --> 39:27.564
The real warning is
that there are people

39:27.566 --> 39:30.767
Who matter more,
and people who matter less.

39:30.769 --> 39:32.001
Those who will be remembered,

39:32.003 --> 39:34.404
And those who will be
forgotten.

39:40.978 --> 39:44.848
I'll make sure
you're remembered.
