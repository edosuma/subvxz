00:16.057 --> 00:18.101


00:22.022 --> 00:24.774


00:26.985 --> 00:29.320
Aw, man. We lost the signal again.

00:29.404 --> 00:30.947
-
-Wait! It's back!

00:31.030 --> 00:32.490
-Which way do we go?
-Right.

00:33.575 --> 00:35.285
-No, no. Left.

00:37.579 --> 00:39.831
No, no, n-n-not left. Reverse!

00:42.667 --> 00:44.502
The signal's all over the place!

00:44.586 --> 00:46.129
How is that possible?

00:46.212 --> 00:47.672
Probably a wormhole.

00:47.756 --> 00:48.757
Whoa!

00:48.840 --> 00:52.135
Bro! You saying the people we're tracking
can manipulate space and time?!

00:52.218 --> 00:54.679
That, or we just have
really bad equipment.

00:55.847 --> 00:57.265
Slow down, we're close.

00:58.475 --> 01:00.727
-There!

01:00.810 --> 01:02.103
Binoculars.

01:03.813 --> 01:05.648
Found 'em. Humanity's biggest threat…

01:06.441 --> 01:09.903
-Yeah, he does look dangerous.
-Not him. Her!

01:10.403 --> 01:13.948
It's Dann. She may look different,
but it's the same person from the Arctic.

01:14.032 --> 01:16.242
She's making good on destroying LA.

01:16.326 --> 01:19.954
Wow. Swimming all the way down here
made her really pruney.

01:20.038 --> 01:22.165
It's a disguise, come on!

01:22.248 --> 01:24.250
Those suits she has can mimic anyone.

01:24.334 --> 01:27.378
Think about it.
Old ladies can go anywhere, right?

01:27.462 --> 01:29.589
They have access to
the best parking spots,

01:29.672 --> 01:31.049
and if anyone catches them,

01:31.132 --> 01:33.843
they just say they got confused
and hand you a butterscotch.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.930
Despicable. Granny's going down!

01:37.013 --> 01:38.348
All the way down.

01:38.431 --> 01:40.767
-Through the Earth!
-That's right.

01:40.850 --> 01:42.185
Out the other side!

01:42.268 --> 01:43.144
Okay.

01:43.228 --> 01:46.064
-And then back into the sky!
-This is getting weird.

01:46.147 --> 01:49.901
We're gonna take that granny so far down
that eventually she'll be going up!

01:51.027 --> 01:53.196
-Are we done?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:54.989 --> 01:58.493
-Oh, no. Big guy's looking our way.
-Think he suspects anything?

01:58.576 --> 02:01.996
No way. We're just some guys in the
front seat of a car, sharing binoculars.

02:06.376 --> 02:08.503
-Here we go.

02:13.883 --> 02:17.011
-He's speeding up.
-Okay, maybe he does suspect something.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.243
They're running!

02:44.747 --> 02:47.333
-Oh, my!
-You're not getting away this time, Dann!

02:47.417 --> 02:49.669
Get off the grandma! Now!

02:49.752 --> 02:54.382
Officers, glad you're here.
This old lady's an evil mastermind robot!

02:57.719 --> 02:58.720
One second…

02:58.803 --> 03:00.805
-Huh?
-Is there a button around here, or…?

03:00.889 --> 03:03.057
This material feels so real,
it's almost like…

03:03.141 --> 03:06.311
Oh, no.
You really are a grandma, aren't you?

03:07.854 --> 03:08.771
Butterscotch?

03:59.614 --> 04:02.700
And that's a wrap, everyone.
Nice work today.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.705
Layla Gray, that was amazing!

04:07.789 --> 04:08.957
Did you get the shot?

04:09.040 --> 04:12.001
Yeah we did!
It was all…

04:12.085 --> 04:13.753
And…

04:13.836 --> 04:15.213
And…

04:15.296 --> 04:18.007
What you do in a car is pure art.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.885
You holding up okay?
Need some room-temperature coconut water?

04:20.969 --> 04:22.387
Gum? Sugarless, spearmint?

04:22.470 --> 04:24.639
-Hey, someone get Layla some gum!

04:24.722 --> 04:25.640
Oh, no.

04:25.723 --> 04:26.766
Is there a problem?

04:26.849 --> 04:29.811
Yeah, I got a couple friends
who are complete idiots.

04:29.894 --> 04:30.812
I gotta go.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.898
<i>And that, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

04:33.982 --> 04:39.487
<i>is an actual stunt being filmed for</i>
<i>the actual Limousine movie franchise!</i>

04:39.570 --> 04:40.655
<i>Cool, huh?</i>

04:41.614 --> 04:44.742
The Stretchening
<i>is a dark origin story</i>

04:44.826 --> 04:47.996
<i>about a big car with small dreams.</i>

04:48.079 --> 04:51.416
Now, Layla Gray
is a professional stuntwoman,

04:51.499 --> 04:54.127
so don't be an idiot
and try any of that at home.

04:54.210 --> 04:57.630
Though to be honest,
I did try some of those stunts at home.

04:57.714 --> 04:59.632
Almost pulled some of them off, too!

04:59.716 --> 05:02.093
You know, my car
has a rocket on it. True story.

05:02.176 --> 05:04.470
Anyway, enough about how awesome I am.

05:04.554 --> 05:09.976
Who wants to see La Brea Studio's
lovably sticky mascot, Tarpy!

05:13.855 --> 05:17.734
Ugh. You know, you two are lucky that
old lady didn't want to press charges.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.235
I know.

05:19.319 --> 05:22.697
And that Toretto's too weak to
break her hip when he tackled her.

05:22.780 --> 05:24.907
Ha ha. Can we not relive this?

05:25.408 --> 05:27.910
Fine. Let's get you two something to eat.

05:27.994 --> 05:31.331
Now you're talking! Jail food's
not as good as you would think.

05:37.712 --> 05:40.673
What?! No way.
You got the gang back together?

05:40.757 --> 05:42.967
Ah, what's up, everybody?!

05:44.385 --> 05:46.095
Uh, you guys okay?

05:46.179 --> 05:49.515
After I heard you got picked up
by the cops, I called everyone together.

05:50.016 --> 05:53.644
This isn't a friendly lunch.
This is an intervention.

05:54.395 --> 05:55.396
A what?

05:55.480 --> 05:59.358
Yo, you two have got to stop
running around LA tackling old ladies!

05:59.442 --> 06:01.903
W-W-We weren't
trying to tackle old ladies!

06:01.986 --> 06:03.362
We were going after Dann.

06:03.446 --> 06:06.866
Tony, Dann got crushed by a glacier
three months ago.

06:06.949 --> 06:10.203
And we don't work for the agency anymore.
They fired us!

06:10.787 --> 06:12.872
I don't want to have this argument again.

06:12.955 --> 06:16.751
You have to hear it. We've all moved on.
You and Cisco need to do the same.

06:16.834 --> 06:19.378
I'm sorry that we don't give up
as easily as you guys.

06:19.462 --> 06:22.965
I'm sorry I don't want to work at my
parents' restaurant or be a stunt driver!

06:23.049 --> 06:25.885
But what you do is awesome.
I'm excited about that new film.

06:26.761 --> 06:30.765
And I definitely don't want to do
whatever lame thing you guys are doing.

06:30.848 --> 06:32.850
Hey, we're proud of our business.

06:32.934 --> 06:35.895
We feel that
Pearl, Hamilton, Haaland and Associates

06:35.978 --> 06:38.981
will be a very successful accounting firm.

06:39.065 --> 06:41.192
We just need to get some associates.

06:41.275 --> 06:45.113
Tony, I'm tired of bailing you out of jail
for chasing down conspiracy theories.

06:45.196 --> 06:47.657
I-It's not a conspiracy theory!

06:47.740 --> 06:50.701
Yeah! We just think
a covert but influential organization

06:50.785 --> 06:52.203
is trying to destroy the world.

06:52.286 --> 06:55.498
That's literally the definition
of a conspiracy theory.

06:56.082 --> 06:59.627
-Who told you that?
-What evidence do you even have?

06:59.710 --> 07:01.003
We're been tracking stories

07:01.087 --> 07:03.548
on people disappearing
or morphing into other people.

07:03.631 --> 07:07.093
W-We talked to witnesses. It's Dann!
It matches what we saw in Europe.

07:07.176 --> 07:09.595
And who are these witnesses exactly?

07:09.679 --> 07:13.474
Well, Sami heard from Gizelle
that when Grace was taking her bunnies

07:13.558 --> 07:17.437
on a motorcycle ride, she saw
someone literally turn into an old woman!

07:17.520 --> 07:20.440
I didn't believe it, but Quiet Kyel
said he heard the same thing.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.733
He barely ever talks,
so you know it's true!

07:22.817 --> 07:24.569
Someone heard something?

07:24.652 --> 07:26.529
Do you see how crazy you sound?

07:26.612 --> 07:28.072
Yeah, and I don't care!

07:28.156 --> 07:31.284
Okay? Dom asked us to do a job,
and I plan on finishing it,

07:31.367 --> 07:34.370
with or without the agency
and with or without you!

07:40.668 --> 07:43.337
I'm sorry you're upset, T,
but the job is done.

07:43.421 --> 07:44.672
It's over.

07:44.755 --> 07:47.175
We solved the case. Dann is gone.

07:47.258 --> 07:49.385
You have to move on with your life.

07:50.052 --> 07:52.513
Thankfully, you've got
your family to help you out.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.015
Did you just say "family"?

07:55.057 --> 07:57.894
Zip it. Look,
if you can get your head straight,

07:57.977 --> 08:00.855
I can pull some strings
and get you a job driving on the lot.

08:00.938 --> 08:03.107
-Working on your movie?
-Kinda…

08:09.655 --> 08:14.327
Okay, tram trainees,
practice time is over.

08:14.410 --> 08:15.453
This is for real.

08:15.536 --> 08:20.625
The big time. The show.
Your first tram tour.

08:21.584 --> 08:24.795
You nervous, Toretto?
You ready to tram up?

08:24.879 --> 08:27.340
No, I feel fine.

08:27.423 --> 08:30.718
Well, you should be nervous!
A baby could start crying at any moment!

08:30.801 --> 08:33.179
Someone could have to
suddenly go to the bathroom!

08:33.262 --> 08:36.974
-What do you do then, huh?
-I don't know. Stop and let them go?

08:38.476 --> 08:42.813
You think you're good, don't you?
Well, we'll see about that.

08:42.897 --> 08:46.025
I'll be riding shotgun
on your first tram tour.

08:46.108 --> 08:48.194
-Let's tram out!

08:49.612 --> 08:51.489
<i>Did you know that La Brea Studios</i>

08:51.572 --> 08:54.158
<i>was actually built around</i>
<i>the famous La Brea tar pits,</i>

08:54.242 --> 08:57.745
which inspired
multiple movie franchises including…

08:58.704 --> 09:03.000
<i>From the Ooze: Skeletal Creatures Return.</i>

09:07.547 --> 09:08.381
You scared?

09:08.464 --> 09:11.217
No. I've gone past this thing
100 times when I was training.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.176
Don't talk back.

09:12.260 --> 09:13.511
-Ugh!
-No ugh-ing.

09:13.594 --> 09:17.139
<i>Of course, La Brea Studios</i>
<i>isn't just known for their scary movies.</i>

09:17.223 --> 09:19.350
They also have world-famous characters

09:19.433 --> 09:23.813
like the loveable pile of
walking, talking tar, Tarpy.

09:23.896 --> 09:28.901
<i>-Hey, everybody! Hope you stick around!</i>

09:28.985 --> 09:33.739
-Tarpy! Tarpy!

09:36.951 --> 09:40.121
Okay, now ease off the gas real slow.
We got a live set here.

09:40.204 --> 09:41.163
I got it.

09:44.292 --> 09:45.459
Action!

10:02.935 --> 10:06.731
And cut! Great work!
Let's reset and go again!

10:08.899 --> 10:12.403
That Layla Gray got
a pretty sweet gig, huh?

10:12.486 --> 10:14.822
Better than being a tram driver,
know what I mean?

10:14.905 --> 10:16.741
You are a tram driver!

10:16.824 --> 10:21.037
No, I'm a tram driver supervisor.
You're a tram driver.

10:24.540 --> 10:25.791
-What?

10:29.170 --> 10:30.296
Dann!

10:35.760 --> 10:37.011
Huh?

10:40.306 --> 10:42.600
Toretto, what are you doing?

10:42.683 --> 10:44.602
And action!

10:50.650 --> 10:51.651
Oh, no!

10:53.027 --> 10:54.070
Toretto?

11:08.959 --> 11:09.919
Ugh!

11:10.670 --> 11:11.671
Uh…

11:12.838 --> 11:15.257
You had one job and
you couldn't even do that right!

11:15.341 --> 11:19.595
Do you know how this makes me look?
You wrecked the tram on the first day!

11:19.678 --> 11:24.308
I mean, I knew you'd wreck
the tram eventually, but the first day?!

11:24.392 --> 11:26.852
-What happened?
-Dipstick wrecked the tram.

11:26.936 --> 11:29.480
Oh, no. Were tourists on it?

11:29.563 --> 11:31.107
A whole busload!

11:31.690 --> 11:35.403
Ugh. But we gave them
some Tarpy t-shirts and they're fine.

11:35.486 --> 11:37.029
Yikes! Those shirts aren't cheap.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.614
-I saw Dann!
-Where?

11:38.697 --> 11:42.118
She was on my tram. She jumped off
and disappeared behind some buildings.

11:42.201 --> 11:45.704
We talked about this: it's not Dann.
You're just obsessed.

11:45.788 --> 11:48.499
Everywhere you look,
you think you see her!

11:49.917 --> 11:52.878
-How's your first day going?
-Oh man, it's great!

11:52.962 --> 11:56.340
Yeah, I got to do maintenance on Tarpy.
That thing is so cool.

11:56.424 --> 11:59.718
It can actually walk and
open and shut its mouth on its own.

11:59.802 --> 12:02.847
It is crazy realistic
for a 30-foot-tall tar pit.

12:02.930 --> 12:05.641
Guys, please,
let's just have a look around.

12:05.724 --> 12:06.851
We won't make any moves

12:06.934 --> 12:09.854
unless we all agree that
something suspicious is going on.

12:09.937 --> 12:13.190
And if we don't find anything,
this is over?

12:13.274 --> 12:17.611
Absolutely! I'll forget all about Dann
and focus on my career as a tram driver.

12:17.695 --> 12:19.029
Ugh. Fine.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.572
-Ah! You got me!

13:01.655 --> 13:04.909
-You got me!

13:07.328 --> 13:10.539
Tell my mom I love her.

13:16.879 --> 13:21.050
Well, we looked everywhere, Toretto.
No Dann, and I got a call time coming up.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.594
And my break's been over
for, like, two hours now.

13:23.677 --> 13:25.471
My new boss probably won't like that.

13:25.554 --> 13:27.056
We upheld our end of the bargain.

13:27.139 --> 13:28.891
Now it's your turn.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.269
Hey, don't look so sad.

13:32.353 --> 13:34.980
It's a good thing that
the world's biggest threat is gone.

13:36.774 --> 13:37.691
Hold up a sec…

13:39.985 --> 13:42.530
-It's Dann. Spread out!

13:48.619 --> 13:51.997
-I don't know what your hands are saying!
-He's going round the other side.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.415
You speak hand?

13:56.502 --> 13:57.419
Don't move!

14:01.507 --> 14:02.341
Yeah, I got 'em!

14:02.424 --> 14:04.051
I got 'em! I, I…

14:04.802 --> 14:06.262
-Echo?

14:06.345 --> 14:07.346
Get off me!

14:07.429 --> 14:09.473
Uh, guys, it's just Echo!

14:09.557 --> 14:13.519
Wait! Those suits can mimic anybody.
How do we know this is really Echo?

14:19.900 --> 14:20.859
Need more proof?

14:21.443 --> 14:23.279
Nope, I-I'm good. I'm good.

14:23.362 --> 14:26.574
-Wait, where did you get that spy glove?
-And what are they doing here?

14:27.658 --> 14:30.536
Oh, Tony, Layla, Cisco…

14:31.245 --> 14:32.580
Hey!

14:32.663 --> 14:35.040
Hey. Are you doing accounting
for the studio?

14:35.124 --> 14:39.044
Yup, that's exactly what we're doing!
Crunching numbers is our real job!

14:39.128 --> 14:41.255
Why did that sound so fake?
What's going on?

14:41.338 --> 14:43.257
Gary, tell the truth.

14:43.340 --> 14:44.425
That is the truth.

14:44.508 --> 14:45.426
Gary.

14:45.509 --> 14:50.222
Uh… Accounting… with…
numbers…

14:50.306 --> 14:51.140
Fine.

14:51.724 --> 14:55.436
We aren't really accountants, okay?
We still work for the spy agency.

14:55.519 --> 14:56.437
What?!

14:56.520 --> 15:00.316
Oh, I am so glad that's out in the open.
I hated lying to you all.

15:00.399 --> 15:04.612
After the team was fired,
Gary, Julius and I were secretly rehired.

15:04.695 --> 15:06.405
They wanted us to track down Dann.

15:06.488 --> 15:07.489
What?!

15:07.573 --> 15:12.036
It turns out she didn't die in the Arctic.
The agency spotted her in LA.

15:12.119 --> 15:16.165
And you let everyone think
I was crazy to think that Dann was alive?

15:16.248 --> 15:17.583
It wasn't my call!

15:17.666 --> 15:21.337
Well, I can't believe that the agency
would rehire you and no one else.

15:21.420 --> 15:22.296
That's cold.

15:22.379 --> 15:23.714
I wanted the entire team,

15:23.797 --> 15:26.717
but they refused because of
the giant mess you made in Europe.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.510
"We" made?

15:28.594 --> 15:31.388
H-How did you even know
that Dann was here at the studio?

15:31.472 --> 15:32.765
Cisco texted me.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.600
W-What?!

15:34.683 --> 15:38.729
Dude! She said she was worried, and that
I should tell her whenever we were spying!

15:38.812 --> 15:39.647
Unbelievable!

15:39.730 --> 15:43.651
You know, I supported you when you
got into spy school, even when I didn't.

15:43.734 --> 15:46.904
And after all that you lied to me?
And used my intel?!

15:47.696 --> 15:50.658
Are you done?
Because I think Dann's right behind you.

16:01.043 --> 16:02.753
If you had come clean earlier,

16:02.836 --> 16:06.090
we could have already found
and captured Dann, but no!

16:06.173 --> 16:08.217
You decided to lie to me.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.302
The reason I had to lie

16:10.386 --> 16:14.348
was because you kept ruining missions,
like you're ruining this one right now!

16:14.431 --> 16:18.394
Okay. Well, you're mad
like Ms. Nowhere is mad,

16:18.477 --> 16:21.981
not like Echo-friend mad, because
I guess Echo-friend doesn't exist anymore.

16:22.064 --> 16:23.691
That's just a cover that you have!

16:24.942 --> 16:26.443
<i>Now, as we enter the jungle,</i>

16:26.527 --> 16:30.489
be on the lookout
for the creatures from the ooze.

16:32.408 --> 16:34.952
Uh… She's not part of the tour.

16:37.454 --> 16:38.914
Sorry! We need this!

16:40.332 --> 16:44.837
You're fired, Toretto! You're fi-red!

16:46.213 --> 16:47.297
Is that Layla Gray?

16:48.257 --> 16:50.300
-Yeah! Um…

16:50.384 --> 16:51.468
Hello, everyone.

16:51.552 --> 16:54.513
I am a stuntwoman here at La Brea Studios,

16:54.596 --> 16:57.599
and this is
the interactive portion of the tour.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.727
So fasten those seatbelts, and enjoy.

16:59.810 --> 17:02.146
-Okay, yes!

17:02.980 --> 17:03.814
There she is!

17:24.168 --> 17:25.711
<i>Hey, everybody!</i>

17:25.794 --> 17:26.962
Wow!

17:27.046 --> 17:28.881
Tarpy's chasing us!

17:28.964 --> 17:33.052
-<i> Hope you stick around!</i>

17:33.135 --> 17:34.762
Yay!

17:34.845 --> 17:38.640
There he is, folks, our loveable mascot.

17:38.724 --> 17:41.727
Tarpy's being drawn to
that device Dann threw on the tram!

17:41.810 --> 17:43.353
The pit's going to eat us!

17:49.234 --> 17:51.987
<i>Hope you stick around!</i>

17:52.071 --> 17:53.447
Julius, come on!

17:59.828 --> 18:01.622
-It won't budge!

18:03.040 --> 18:04.124
Jump!

18:14.259 --> 18:15.928
It's got us!

18:16.011 --> 18:18.347
Oh, man! This is amazing!

18:20.390 --> 18:23.519
If we wanna catch up to Dann,
we need to lose that walking tar pit!

18:23.602 --> 18:25.687
I've been working maintenance on Tarpy.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.773
I think I can take him down
from the inside.

18:27.856 --> 18:29.191
How are you gonna get inside?

18:29.274 --> 18:31.026
I'm gonna get myself eaten!

18:31.110 --> 18:31.944
Wait, Cisco.

18:32.027 --> 18:33.237
Are you sure about this?

18:33.320 --> 18:34.321
I-I'm sure.

18:34.404 --> 18:36.824
You get Dann, I'll stop the tar pit.

19:07.187 --> 19:10.357
-Yay! Amazing!

19:14.778 --> 19:16.613
-I love this job.

19:20.617 --> 19:21.618
We've lost her.

19:22.494 --> 19:23.328
Look!

19:33.839 --> 19:36.300
We could speed walk
faster than this!

19:36.383 --> 19:37.217
I got you.

19:38.886 --> 19:39.803
Hang on!

19:49.605 --> 19:50.522
There she is!

20:16.381 --> 20:17.591
No, you don't!

20:21.261 --> 20:24.389
This is the craziest stunt show
I've ever seen.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.069
Tony!

20:37.152 --> 20:38.403
-Don't let go!

20:40.280 --> 20:41.782
I'm not planning on it!

20:58.131 --> 21:01.051
-Awesome!
-How'd you know we needed help?

21:01.134 --> 21:01.969
Please.

21:02.052 --> 21:04.930
I've got eyes on you guys at all times.

21:05.430 --> 21:06.265
Oh!

21:07.182 --> 21:08.016
Oh…

21:15.065 --> 21:17.818
Y'all did pretty good out there
for your first stunt.

21:17.901 --> 21:20.320
You're welcome to join our crew anytime!

21:20.404 --> 21:24.241
And that, ladies and gentlemen,
was the La Brea Studios tram tour!

21:25.951 --> 21:28.787
-I love it.
-Best tour ever!

21:28.870 --> 21:32.082
-

21:52.060 --> 21:54.563
Ugh! This place is a mess.

21:55.147 --> 21:56.940
I think some raccoons took over.

21:57.024 --> 21:59.234
Time to get this place up and running.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.695
The Spy Racers are back
for one final mission:

22:01.778 --> 22:03.405
to take down Dann.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.783
If we're gonna do this,
we're gonna need help.

22:07.826 --> 22:09.911
We're gonna need Nowhere.

22:38.356 --> 22:40.275
