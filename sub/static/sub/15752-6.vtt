00:14.515 --> 00:17.518
So I don't think
I can do those things.

00:17.518 --> 00:20.288
I thought the same thing
when I first joined CrossFit,

00:20.288 --> 00:22.090
but I bet you'll
surprise yourself.

00:22.090 --> 00:23.891
I know you have the stamina.

00:23.891 --> 00:28.929
Well, I have
a very inspiring coach.

00:28.929 --> 00:29.930
Do your best, all right.

00:29.930 --> 00:31.499
I want this to be our thing.

00:31.499 --> 00:33.201
It's a lot of fun, okay?

00:33.201 --> 00:34.635
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:34.635 --> 00:36.937

All right, listen up, class.

00:40.174 --> 00:42.376
Today's workout is IDA.

00:42.376 --> 00:43.911
- I hate IDA.
- Who's Ida?

00:43.911 --> 00:47.215
IDA is a mean,
cold-hearted bitch.

00:47.215 --> 00:50.251
IDA will find your weak spots
and exploit them.

00:50.251 --> 00:52.820
IDA is 500 sit-ups, 200 burpees,

00:52.820 --> 00:54.722
100 Olympic clean and presses,

00:54.722 --> 00:56.290
then the three timed heats.

00:56.290 --> 00:57.558
Don't worry.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.327
It sounds worse
than it actually is.

00:59.327 --> 01:02.130
Now, I'm required by our lawyers
to read this statement aloud.

01:02.130 --> 01:03.597
"This is a strenuous workout.

01:03.597 --> 01:05.199
"And we are not scaling
in here.

01:05.199 --> 01:06.500
"So if you're 40 or older,

01:06.500 --> 01:08.136
proceed at your own risk."

01:13.941 --> 01:15.509
(man)
All right, guys.
Spread out.

She-donism,

01:33.494 --> 01:34.828
the latest soon-to-be
best seller

01:34.828 --> 01:37.165
by our very own
Annabelle Bancroft.

01:37.165 --> 01:38.866
Annabelle will be doing
Andy Cohen tonight

01:38.866 --> 01:40.268
and Hoda and Kathie Lee tomorrow

01:40.268 --> 01:42.002
before heading off
on her ten-city book tour.

01:42.002 --> 01:43.904
I just want to say
I read the book last night,

01:43.904 --> 01:45.206
loved it.

01:45.206 --> 01:46.640
For those of you
who haven't seen the galleys,

01:46.640 --> 01:48.075
the book is
about three best friends,

01:48.075 --> 01:49.310
all recently divorced,

01:49.310 --> 01:51.179
who make a slut pact
never to remarry.

01:51.179 --> 01:53.247
Marketing has created t-shirts
to be given away

01:53.247 --> 01:54.848
at point of purchase

01:54.848 --> 01:57.385
and at the She-donism book
launch party tomorrow night.

01:57.385 --> 01:58.519
Liza.

02:01.755 --> 02:03.924
I'd like to bring
Anton Bjornberg.

02:03.924 --> 02:06.360
He's alone here.
His family's in Sweden.

02:06.360 --> 02:08.895
Also, he'd get to see what to
expect for his own launch party.

02:08.895 --> 02:10.198
By all means,
invite him.

02:10.198 --> 02:11.465
Thank you.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.201
Just don't give him false
expectations

02:13.201 --> 02:14.735
about his own book launch.

02:14.735 --> 02:17.104
Not everyone can have champagne
in fur-wrapped bottles.

02:20.708 --> 02:23.211
I need you to double confirm
the RSVP list

02:23.211 --> 02:25.446
and make sure Anderson Cooper's
office knows

02:25.446 --> 02:26.880
we will be sending a car
for him

02:26.880 --> 02:28.216
and his hot Latin boyfriend.

02:28.216 --> 02:29.883
Done and done.

02:29.883 --> 02:31.819
And Annabelle insists that all
the vodka tomorrow night--

02:31.819 --> 02:33.554
Organic and gluten-free.
Got it.

02:33.554 --> 02:34.888
Are you limping?
What's wrong?

02:34.888 --> 02:36.390
I need you not crippled
right now.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.691
I'm sorry.

02:37.691 --> 02:39.026
I took a CrossFit class
this morning,

02:39.026 --> 02:40.294
and I think I tore my--
everything.

02:40.294 --> 02:42.363
Liza, when I was your age,
I could run a 10K

02:42.363 --> 02:43.897
and rehydrate
with White Russians.

02:47.067 --> 02:49.537
Oh, God, help us.

02:49.537 --> 02:51.372
She's smoking
in my office.

Annabelle.

02:58.111 --> 03:01.249
Oh, nobody told me
you were here.

03:01.249 --> 03:02.950
I have some concerns
about tomorrow night.

03:02.950 --> 03:04.718
I saw the media alert
for the party.

03:04.718 --> 03:06.987
And, frankly,
I'm not happy.

03:06.987 --> 03:09.257
Annabelle, it's going
to be a fantastic event

03:09.257 --> 03:12.125
in one of the hottest clubs
in the Meatpacking District.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.727
Which would all be just
so exciting

03:13.727 --> 03:15.329
if this was 2003.

03:15.329 --> 03:18.266
Why not just go all the way
and invite Paris Hilton?

03:18.266 --> 03:20.067
She passed...

03:20.067 --> 03:21.602
because she wasn't invited.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.437
Sweetie,
you're phoning it in.

03:23.437 --> 03:26.274
This party should be
somewhere interesting,

03:26.274 --> 03:28.676
like in an industrial shipping
container

03:28.676 --> 03:30.344
or some skanky club
in Brooklyn.

03:30.344 --> 03:31.345
Liza lives in Brooklyn.

03:31.345 --> 03:32.646
- Who?
- Liza.

03:32.646 --> 03:34.915
My assistant, Liza.
She lives in Brooklyn.

03:34.915 --> 03:36.384
Uh, yes, that's right.

03:36.384 --> 03:37.585
I--I live in Williamsburg.

03:37.585 --> 03:40.321
Is that the t-shirt?

03:40.321 --> 03:41.389
Annabelle Bancroft.

03:41.389 --> 03:44.458
It is so nice to meet you, Liza.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.994
Annabelle, may I just say
what a fan I am of your work.

03:46.994 --> 03:48.429
I've read all your books.

03:48.429 --> 03:50.798
I loved Mantastic
and Goldman Sex.

03:50.798 --> 03:54.802
Liza, just what are
we gonna do about this party?

03:54.802 --> 03:57.137
I spent the last year
like a little mouse

03:57.137 --> 03:59.940
in my little mouse house
typing and typing,

03:59.940 --> 04:02.175
and now I just want
to have a good time.

04:02.175 --> 04:04.177
Of course.
That's what we're here for.

04:04.177 --> 04:06.113
I want this party
to be epic.

04:06.113 --> 04:08.316
I want hot men
and live peacocks

04:08.316 --> 04:10.117
and young people
that no one would ever think

04:10.117 --> 04:11.619
to invite to something
like this,

04:11.619 --> 04:12.820
because they're under the radar

04:12.820 --> 04:14.455
and much too interesting
to bother.

04:14.455 --> 04:15.856
They're on the cusp.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.558
Do you know what I'm saying,
Liza?

04:17.558 --> 04:19.159
Um, yes, yes, I do.

04:19.159 --> 04:20.827
You want
cusp-ers,

04:20.827 --> 04:22.330
young cusp-ers.

04:22.330 --> 04:24.031
She knows
what I'm talking about.

04:24.031 --> 04:26.934
Liza is my secret weapon
for all things youth culture.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.736
She's dating a tattoo artist.

04:28.736 --> 04:30.638
Uh, yes,
that's true.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.005
He's pretty amazing.

04:32.005 --> 04:33.541
He's invited.

04:33.541 --> 04:35.376
Liza's going to step up
and really take charge

04:35.376 --> 04:38.211
of making sure this party
is fun, young, and hot.

04:38.211 --> 04:41.382
In fact, I'm going to make
her run point

04:41.382 --> 04:42.383
for the party tomorrow.

04:42.383 --> 04:43.384
Me?

04:43.384 --> 04:44.718
Oh, wow.

04:44.718 --> 04:47.020
Oh, God, please tell me
you're not one of those

04:47.020 --> 04:49.357
earnest millenials
who's never had a cigarette

04:49.357 --> 04:51.224
and thinks her parents
are heroes.

04:51.224 --> 04:53.361
Nope.
Definitely not.

05:00.368 --> 05:02.670
Guess who's just been promoted
to point person

05:02.670 --> 05:03.737
on the She-donism party?

05:03.737 --> 05:04.838
What?

05:04.838 --> 05:06.239
Diana is giving up control?

05:06.239 --> 05:08.709
Annabelle wants
a younger vibe.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.177
Of course she does.

05:10.177 --> 05:11.912
I'm sure she also has
some young intern

05:11.912 --> 05:13.046
writing her tweets.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.615
It's really amazing to me

05:14.615 --> 05:16.950
the way this older generation
just totally exploits us

05:16.950 --> 05:18.085
to try to seem relevant.

05:18.085 --> 05:19.520
Uh, totally.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.154
We should file
a class-action lawsuit

05:21.154 --> 05:22.490
on behalf of exploited youth.

05:22.490 --> 05:24.024
(Kelsey)
Right?

05:24.024 --> 05:26.293
And then use that money to pay
for their Social Security,

05:26.293 --> 05:28.496
which will go totally bankrupt
by the time we need it.

05:34.535 --> 05:35.536
Everything okay?

05:35.536 --> 05:37.871
Uh, I--I don't know.

05:37.871 --> 05:40.007
It's my ex...

05:40.007 --> 05:42.109
my exercise instructor.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.477
He's worried about me.

05:43.477 --> 05:45.413
That is so nice of him
to check in on you.

05:45.413 --> 05:48.015
Yeah, I mean,
it was a really strenuous class.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.316
Um, you know what,

05:49.316 --> 05:50.618
why don't you go
to lunch without me.

05:50.618 --> 05:52.420
I'm gonna let him know
that I'm okay.

05:52.420 --> 05:53.286

Liza.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.910
Thanks for coming.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.045
You look great.

06:18.045 --> 06:19.447
- Thank you.
- Sit down.

06:19.447 --> 06:20.881
I can only stay
for a few minutes.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.049
Yeah.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.452
Can we--

06:24.452 --> 06:26.353
So she'll have French roast,
low-fat milk,

06:26.353 --> 06:31.525
toasted scooped bagel
and a side of sliced cucumbers.

06:31.525 --> 06:32.460
I forgot.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.327
Hm, just the coffee, please.

06:34.327 --> 06:36.363
Yeah?

06:36.363 --> 06:38.065
All right,
what's the emergency, David?

06:38.065 --> 06:39.299
Oh, okay, so, um...

06:39.299 --> 06:40.501
I just have
to ask you a favor.

06:40.501 --> 06:41.869
It's not gonna cost you
a dime.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.471
What kind of favor?

06:43.471 --> 06:45.706
I just want to sign over
the title of The Liza to you.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.140
What? Why?

06:47.140 --> 06:51.912
Just so we can keep it safe.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.280
Did you gamble away the boat?

06:53.280 --> 06:54.682
Lo--
[sighs]

06:54.682 --> 06:57.150
A guy who hasn't fumbled
in his entire career

06:57.150 --> 06:58.952
fumbles twice in one game.

06:58.952 --> 07:00.621
How is that even possible?

07:00.621 --> 07:02.055
David, what did I say
when I moved out?

07:02.055 --> 07:03.323
I'm not asking for money.

07:03.323 --> 07:05.225
It's just--It--
just some paperwork.

07:05.225 --> 07:06.860
Why don't you ask
your girlfriend?

07:06.860 --> 07:12.032
She's proving to be
less than sympathetic.

07:12.032 --> 07:15.368
Does she not know
about this?

07:15.368 --> 07:17.705
Liza, I hate asking you this.

07:17.705 --> 07:20.508
I know how difficult
I've made things for you.

07:20.508 --> 07:22.576
It's just, this boat means
a lot to me.

07:22.576 --> 07:26.814
It's the last thing that I
have...

07:26.814 --> 07:27.981
from us.

07:27.981 --> 07:30.350
Just--just think about it.

07:30.350 --> 07:31.952
Okay. I'll think about it.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.587
Oh, yeah.
I got this.

07:33.587 --> 07:34.588
I got it.

07:34.588 --> 07:35.623
Thank you.

07:35.623 --> 07:36.557
Yeah.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.861
Actually,
do you have a single?

07:45.265 --> 07:47.535
(Liza)
I can't believe we're
practically divorced,

07:47.535 --> 07:49.269
and he's still pulling
this crap.

07:49.269 --> 07:52.540
Then I see him, and it's like
this old feeling kicks in,

07:52.540 --> 07:54.007
like I want to take care of him.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.944
Well, I, for one,
say take the boat, sell it,

07:56.944 --> 07:58.345
and keep the money.

07:58.345 --> 08:00.548
Maggie, that boat
is practically worthless.

08:00.548 --> 08:02.015
Half my memories are
of the two of us

08:02.015 --> 08:03.283
bailing the damn thing out.

08:03.283 --> 08:04.785
Well, then,
why does David want it?

08:04.785 --> 08:06.153
I don't know.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.656
It's like that boat
is that one connection he has

08:08.656 --> 08:11.625
with the man he used to be

08:11.625 --> 08:13.393
and I think
would like to be again.

08:13.393 --> 08:16.697
[phone buzzing]

08:16.697 --> 08:18.566
Annabelle says
she's gonna slit her wrists

08:18.566 --> 08:20.467
if there's any fluorescent
lighting at the party,

08:20.467 --> 08:22.570
and she wants to approve
all the waiters' head shots.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.304
What a demanding bitch.

08:24.304 --> 08:25.939
Can't wait to see my gift bag.

08:25.939 --> 08:27.007
Uh. Ow.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.008
Are you okay?

08:28.008 --> 08:29.142
Uh, yeah.

08:29.142 --> 08:30.243
I may have ruptured my groin.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.078
It's a small price.

08:32.078 --> 08:33.780
See you later.
Okay. Yeah.

08:36.650 --> 08:40.854
No, no, I don't need a peahen.
I need a peacock.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.789
Cock!

08:42.789 --> 08:44.825
I need at least three
of the biggest,

08:44.825 --> 08:47.094
most beautiful cocks you have.

08:47.094 --> 08:48.095
(Diana)
Liza.

08:48.095 --> 08:50.430
Come in my office.

08:50.430 --> 08:51.932
I'm gonna have to call you back,
sir.

08:54.802 --> 08:57.470
Liza, I hope you realize the
opportunity I'm giving you.

08:57.470 --> 08:59.106
- I do, Diana.
- Good.

08:59.106 --> 09:02.442
Because my assistants
don't stay assistants very long.

09:02.442 --> 09:04.177
They move up,
or they move out.

09:04.177 --> 09:07.948
I'm going to be following
this party very carefully...

09:07.948 --> 09:08.949
on Twitter.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.483
What--you're not gonna be there?

09:10.483 --> 09:12.019
I have known Annabelle

09:12.019 --> 09:14.121
since she was writing sex tips
for Cosmopolitan

09:14.121 --> 09:15.455
back when I was your age.

09:15.455 --> 09:16.990
- Seriously?
- Mm.

09:16.990 --> 09:19.026
She used to be
my closest friend.

09:19.026 --> 09:20.493
We were wild.

09:20.493 --> 09:22.362
She was always trying
to get us to have a three-way

09:22.362 --> 09:23.463
with Jay McInerney.

09:23.463 --> 09:24.998
What happened?

09:24.998 --> 09:27.467
Well, I got serious
about my career,

09:27.467 --> 09:29.502
but for Annabelle,
the party never stopped.

09:29.502 --> 09:31.304
I've tried to get her
into rehab.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.641
There is only so much you can do
for people who need help,

09:33.641 --> 09:35.676
but won't get it.

09:35.676 --> 09:37.845
Well, sometimes people
need a second chance.

09:37.845 --> 09:40.180
I don't carry deadweight well

09:40.180 --> 09:41.514
in my personal life

09:41.514 --> 09:43.717
or in my office.

09:43.717 --> 09:45.085
Good luck tonight.

09:54.061 --> 09:55.295
(man)
* Hey, hey, hey

09:55.295 --> 09:57.665
* Hey, hey,
chicka-choo-cha *

09:57.665 --> 09:59.900
(woman)
* Ah

09:59.900 --> 10:01.902
* Ah

10:01.902 --> 10:03.904
* Ah

10:03.904 --> 10:05.338
* Ah

10:05.338 --> 10:06.707
Laurent,
I'm so sorry.

10:06.707 --> 10:08.041
I don't see your name
on the list.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.176
What's the last name?

10:09.176 --> 10:11.478
It's just Laurent.

10:11.478 --> 10:14.614
Never mind...
[speaks French]

10:14.614 --> 10:15.683
Hey.

10:15.683 --> 10:16.884
Oh, my gosh.
You look amazing.

10:16.884 --> 10:18.118
Thanks. You too.
How's it going?

10:18.118 --> 10:19.319
Oh, so far, so good.

10:19.319 --> 10:20.954
I just wish people
were tweeting more.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.222
I really need you to post
something cool,

10:22.222 --> 10:23.290
like, every five minutes.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.524
Okay, but can I send it as,

10:24.524 --> 10:26.359
like, an email attachment
instead?

10:26.359 --> 10:27.695
No.

10:27.695 --> 10:29.529
Uh, just go find a hot girl
with a Twitter account.

10:29.529 --> 10:31.364
All right, well, then,
she made a list.

10:31.364 --> 10:34.301
Wait a second.
Courtney Austin is here?

10:34.301 --> 10:36.403
Yeah, she's, like, the Martha
Stewart of beauty blogs.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.605
Oh, yeah, I've had a thing
for that woman for years.

10:38.605 --> 10:39.873
I mean, like, seriously,

10:39.873 --> 10:41.942
vivid dreams--
absolutely filthy.

10:41.942 --> 10:44.244
And I hear she's finally single.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.346
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

10:46.346 --> 10:47.881
- Lauren, hey.
- Hey.

10:47.881 --> 10:50.117
You told me to bring people.
I brought my whole list.

10:50.117 --> 10:52.485
So you don't have to worry
about your list.

10:52.485 --> 10:56.056
Trust me.
My list is much better.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.725
Oh, my God.
You got peacocks.

10:57.725 --> 10:59.226
That is so awesome.

10:59.226 --> 11:00.560
Yeah, and make sure
to tweet about it

11:00.560 --> 11:01.729
and tag your friends,

11:01.729 --> 11:03.396
hashtag #She-donism,
hashtag #SlutPact.

11:03.396 --> 11:04.798
Relax.
They'll tweet.

11:04.798 --> 11:06.266
- Liza.
- Annabelle.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.301
Are you having fun?
Katie Holmes is here.

11:08.301 --> 11:10.570
I just got
the most disturbing text.

11:10.570 --> 11:13.173
Somebody turned away
my coke dealer at the door.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.108
(Josh)
Hey, party girl.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.977
Josh!
Hi.

11:16.977 --> 11:19.947
Uh, Annabelle, this is Josh.

11:19.947 --> 11:21.048
Annabelle, nice to meet you.

11:21.048 --> 11:23.884
Okay, he is very hot.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.618
And it's my party,

11:25.618 --> 11:28.956
so every hot man here is
my property for the night.

11:28.956 --> 11:30.657
Come on, Josh.

11:30.657 --> 11:33.293
Let's get those tats a drink.

11:33.293 --> 11:36.797
Oh, is that a dolphin?

11:36.797 --> 11:40.834
And where is that naughty
little dolphin diving to?

11:44.137 --> 11:45.405
Hello, Flipper.

11:49.209 --> 11:52.212
[upbeat dance music]

11:52.212 --> 11:53.781
Hey, Courtney.
Hi.

11:53.781 --> 11:55.548
- Maggie.
- I heard you were here.

11:55.548 --> 11:56.683
What a surprise.

11:56.683 --> 11:57.684
Wow, you look beautiful.

11:57.684 --> 11:58.786
Thank you.

11:58.786 --> 12:00.587
I'm so sorry
about you and Susie.

12:00.587 --> 12:02.790
You guys were together
for so long.

12:02.790 --> 12:03.957
Five years.

12:03.957 --> 12:05.425
But it's all for the better,
really.

12:05.425 --> 12:06.794
We wanted different things.

12:06.794 --> 12:08.095
Mm.

12:08.095 --> 12:10.898
So does this mean I can finally
ask you out on a date?

12:10.898 --> 12:12.332
Maggie, I would love that.

12:12.332 --> 12:16.469
But, first, I really need
to find a bathroom.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.471
Oh, wow.
You're pregnant.

12:18.471 --> 12:19.807
Oh, I thought you knew--

12:19.807 --> 12:21.108
with twins!

12:21.108 --> 12:22.275
Oh.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.011
Don't move.

12:24.011 --> 12:25.445
(woman)
* I want you

12:25.445 --> 12:27.647
* I want to be with you

12:29.817 --> 12:32.820
So will I have
a book party like this?

12:32.820 --> 12:34.221
Mm.

12:34.221 --> 12:35.923
Would you like a book party
like this?

12:35.923 --> 12:37.624
Absolutely not.

12:37.624 --> 12:40.560
[laughter]

12:41.962 --> 12:43.430
You look beautiful tonight.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.333
Anton, I hope that
you didn't sign with me

12:46.333 --> 12:47.835
for the wrong reasons.

12:47.835 --> 12:49.602
Do you really believe
that I would put my book

12:49.602 --> 12:52.205
in the hands of anyone other
than an extraordinary editor?

12:52.205 --> 12:53.907
I would hope not.

12:53.907 --> 12:55.909
But you cannot deny
that there is an attraction.

12:55.909 --> 12:59.312
No.

12:59.312 --> 13:01.281
I just...

13:01.281 --> 13:05.318
don't want us becoming confused
about what's really important.

13:05.318 --> 13:09.389
I believe it was Fitzgerald
who said that,

13:09.389 --> 13:11.758
"The test of
a first-rate intelligence

13:11.758 --> 13:14.394
"is the ability to hold
two opposed ideas

13:14.394 --> 13:15.562
in mind at the same time."

13:15.562 --> 13:17.330
I think it's highly possible

13:17.330 --> 13:20.868
that F. Scott Fitzgerald
was drunk

13:20.868 --> 13:21.869
when he said that.

13:21.869 --> 13:23.937
[chuckles]

13:23.937 --> 13:26.874
[glass clinking]

13:28.141 --> 13:30.878
I wanted to say from the bottom
of my heart,

13:30.878 --> 13:33.280
thank you, all,
so much for coming tonight.

13:33.280 --> 13:36.116
She-donism is more than a book.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.885
It's a bible.

13:37.885 --> 13:39.887
There's only one commandment:

13:39.887 --> 13:41.021
Close your hearts,

13:41.021 --> 13:43.256
and open your legs
for everything

13:43.256 --> 13:44.925
life has to offer!

13:44.925 --> 13:46.293
Ha ha, Annabelle.

13:46.293 --> 13:49.529
Oh, your unique sense of humor
is what is sure

13:49.529 --> 13:50.530
to make She-donism

13:50.530 --> 13:52.765
your next best seller.

13:52.765 --> 13:55.936
Oh, my God.
I see my dealer.

13:55.936 --> 13:57.905
Laurent!

13:59.139 --> 14:00.908
[all gasping]

14:00.908 --> 14:01.909
Oh, my God.

14:01.909 --> 14:03.076
Oh, my God.

14:03.076 --> 14:04.177
Are you okay?

14:04.177 --> 14:05.178
Yeah, I'm good.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.646
Okay, hi, Laurent--

14:06.646 --> 14:08.481
All right, okay, yeah.
It's still glass.

14:08.481 --> 14:10.117
Go around.
It's okay.

14:10.117 --> 14:11.318
It's okay.

14:11.318 --> 14:12.485
Don't tweet that.

14:12.485 --> 14:14.087
What?

14:14.087 --> 14:16.623
(woman)
* I want to get the party
started *

14:16.623 --> 14:18.425
* Let me see you shake it,
shake it *

14:24.364 --> 14:26.233
Maggie, have you seen Annabelle?

14:26.233 --> 14:28.468
No, but I did find Courtney.

14:28.468 --> 14:29.569
She's nine months pregnant.

14:29.569 --> 14:30.938
She wants me to take her home

14:30.938 --> 14:32.005
so we can bang each other's
brains out.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.806
Apparently,
double the hormones,

14:33.806 --> 14:34.807
double the horny.

14:34.807 --> 14:36.043
Wow. Good for her.

14:36.043 --> 14:37.677
All I cared about
in my last trimester

14:37.677 --> 14:39.212
was fried chicken
and my doughnut pillow.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.847
Listen, can you stay
at Josh's tonight?

14:40.847 --> 14:42.415
Sure.
Are you gonna go for it?

14:42.415 --> 14:44.851
Why not? You know, sometimes
life gives you what you ask for.

14:44.851 --> 14:47.720
But just--it's just not
the way you pictured it.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.190
Besides, her tits are huge now.

14:50.190 --> 14:52.092
Oh, all right.

14:52.092 --> 14:53.093
Did you see this?

14:53.093 --> 14:55.228
(Lauren)
Annabelle is a Vine.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.529
[all gasp]

14:56.529 --> 14:57.530
[all gasp]

14:57.530 --> 14:58.966
[gasps]
Oh, my God.

14:58.966 --> 15:00.233
- How do we take that down?
- Take it down?

15:00.233 --> 15:01.868
You can't buy
this kind of publicity.

15:01.868 --> 15:03.971
Believe me.
I have tried.

15:03.971 --> 15:05.305
Oh, mop and bucket--
I got to go.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.240
That's got Annabelle written
all over it.

15:07.240 --> 15:11.178
Stay.

15:11.178 --> 15:12.112
Okay.

15:14.547 --> 15:16.516
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

15:16.516 --> 15:17.617
Oh...

15:17.617 --> 15:19.252
Diana?

15:19.252 --> 15:21.354
I saw everything on Twitter.
This party is a disaster.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.190
(Liza)
No, no, it's not a disaster.

15:23.190 --> 15:26.593
We have thousands of retweets,
and we're a Vine--

15:26.593 --> 15:28.895
a trending Vine.

15:28.895 --> 15:30.797
You're welcome.

15:30.797 --> 15:32.865
(Diana)
Let's just get her out of here
before she kills herself.

15:32.865 --> 15:36.303
(Annabelle)
Is that Diana?
Dirty Diana.

15:36.303 --> 15:37.770
[shushes]

15:37.770 --> 15:40.507
Oh, let's go to Club Shelter
and dance in a cage.

15:40.507 --> 15:41.541
Shut up.
I'm taking you home.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.776
You used to be fun.

15:43.776 --> 15:47.114
I still love you, Grandma.

15:47.114 --> 15:50.917
Oh, okay, let's get her
out the back door quietly.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.485
You're a really good friend.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.454
No, a good friend would
stop bailing her out

15:54.454 --> 15:55.788
and let her hit rock bottom.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.590
This is professional.
She is my author.

15:57.590 --> 15:59.059
Now let's get her out of here

15:59.059 --> 16:00.593
while she still has her
underwear on.

16:00.593 --> 16:02.729
Hoist.
[grunts] Oh, God.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.597
I still have my underwear on?

16:04.597 --> 16:07.267
This was a terrible party.

16:07.267 --> 16:11.538
Liza, why did so many Amish move
to Williamsburg?

16:11.538 --> 16:13.706
They're not Amish.
They're Hasidic.

16:13.706 --> 16:14.874
But they're all wearing Prada.

16:14.874 --> 16:16.176
How do they afford it?

16:16.176 --> 16:18.045
What do they all do
for a living?

16:18.045 --> 16:19.812
They're not wearing Prada.
That's just how they dress.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.114
Get her in the car

16:21.114 --> 16:22.915
before she chokes
on her hair extensions.

16:22.915 --> 16:25.052
(Annabelle)
I ordered a white Town car
with beige interior.

16:25.052 --> 16:26.819
All right, let's get
you buckled up for safety.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.255
Be careful with your hands,
sweetie.

16:28.255 --> 16:30.057
They're a dead giveaway.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.595
This is your purse.

16:35.595 --> 16:38.098
When you throw up,
you throw up straight into it.

16:38.098 --> 16:39.866
- Understand?
- Understand what?

16:45.638 --> 16:46.839
Miss Winehouse left her shoes--

16:46.839 --> 16:48.141
Oh, that's all right.

16:48.141 --> 16:49.709
I'll bring them
to her doorman later.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.978
- Okay.
- Okay.

16:51.978 --> 16:53.513
(Annabelle)
Club Shelter, please.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.216
- No.
- Whoo!

16:58.585 --> 16:59.552
(woman)
* Oh

17:02.822 --> 17:03.823
[grunts]

17:03.823 --> 17:05.425
Huh.

17:05.425 --> 17:07.359
I haven't been off my feet
for the last 17 hours.

17:07.359 --> 17:10.130
It was fun visiting you
at work, though.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.864
You are such a good sport.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.300
It was very entertaining.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.768
[groans]
Make it stop.

17:15.768 --> 17:16.868
I can't see it.

17:16.868 --> 17:18.137
It's awful.

17:18.137 --> 17:20.772
You know, I figured out
what her problem is.

17:20.772 --> 17:21.907
What's that?

17:21.907 --> 17:24.010
That she won't act her age.

17:24.010 --> 17:25.912
I mean,
she's clearly in her 40s.

17:25.912 --> 17:28.115
She acts like she's in her 20s.

17:28.115 --> 17:32.119
I mean,
why would people do that?

17:32.119 --> 17:36.323
I think some women
feel a little...

17:36.323 --> 17:38.024
I don't know--
lost

17:38.024 --> 17:40.493
when they turn 40.

17:40.493 --> 17:43.563
You know, there's a lot
of pressure to be young.

17:43.563 --> 17:44.897
[chuckles]

17:44.897 --> 17:47.367
I wonder what we're gonna be
like in our 40s.

17:47.367 --> 17:50.503
I think I'm gonna be a lot
like I am now.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.239
Me too.

17:52.239 --> 17:54.241
Ow. CrossFit.

17:54.241 --> 17:55.875
The more you do it,
the less it hurts.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.177
Sure.

18:00.046 --> 18:01.914
[chuckles]

18:12.859 --> 18:14.561
Did you see?

18:14.561 --> 18:18.231
Finally fixed the bimini top.

18:18.231 --> 18:20.967
I can't take the title, David.

18:20.967 --> 18:22.335
Sure you can.

18:22.335 --> 18:23.970
And you can use the boat
whenever you want.

18:23.970 --> 18:26.038
They still do fireworks out here
on the Fourth.

18:26.038 --> 18:28.074
No, I can't keep
bailing you out.

18:28.074 --> 18:29.576
It isn't helping you.

18:29.576 --> 18:30.943
If I'd stopped a long time ago,

18:30.943 --> 18:32.912
maybe things wouldn't have
gotten this bad.

18:32.912 --> 18:34.247
Things aren't that bad.

18:34.247 --> 18:35.748
I just hit a rough spot.
That's all.

18:35.748 --> 18:37.317
I'm gonna turn it around.
You'll see.

18:37.317 --> 18:40.320
I'm not gonna take the boat,
David.

18:40.320 --> 18:41.554
But I'll lose her.

18:41.554 --> 18:44.491
I know.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.092
Wow.

18:46.092 --> 18:49.596
It's like you turned into this
completely different person.

18:49.596 --> 18:51.864
[chuckles]

18:51.864 --> 18:55.802
Maybe I have.

18:55.802 --> 18:56.736
Good luck, David.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.251
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:11.251 --> 19:14.321
Did you get the tablet art
for the Happy Vegan Cookbook?

19:14.321 --> 19:15.755
Uh, yeah,
I'll forward it to you.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.056
Thanks.

19:17.056 --> 19:20.827
So are we just not gonna talk
about Bjornberg?

19:20.827 --> 19:23.730
I saw you guys last night
at the party.

19:23.730 --> 19:25.232
Oh.

19:25.232 --> 19:27.367
And Diana almost saw you too.

19:27.367 --> 19:29.536
Yikes.
All right.

19:29.536 --> 19:30.703
I will be more discreet.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.439
I don't think it's discretion

19:32.439 --> 19:33.773
that's the issue.

19:33.773 --> 19:36.343
I don't think I need
a lecture right now.

19:36.343 --> 19:39.312
Kelsey, I'm only saying this
because I care about you.

19:39.312 --> 19:40.480
And you're too smart
to be known

19:40.480 --> 19:42.615
as the editor who sleeps
with her author.

19:42.615 --> 19:44.717
Okay, Liza,
I know that you care.

19:44.717 --> 19:46.519
But I know what I'm doing.

19:46.519 --> 19:49.622
And you're not my mother.

19:49.622 --> 19:51.924
You know what,
you're right.

19:51.924 --> 19:52.992
I'm sorry.

19:52.992 --> 19:55.728
I am so totally
not your mother.

19:57.764 --> 19:59.932
(man)
* Ooh, ooh

19:59.932 --> 20:01.000
* Ooh, ooh

20:01.000 --> 20:02.835
Caitlin, hey.

20:02.835 --> 20:05.472
I can't believe it's been a week
since I last talked to you.

20:05.472 --> 20:06.806
I heard Dad had to get rid
of the boat.

20:06.806 --> 20:09.008
Uh, yeah, I heard about that.

20:09.008 --> 20:11.143
Sucks.
First the house, now the boat.

20:11.143 --> 20:13.179
It's like everything's
going away.

20:13.179 --> 20:14.814
Well, I'm not going away

20:14.814 --> 20:16.215
ever.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.317
You hear me?

20:17.317 --> 20:19.819
Yeah.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.654
All right, so tell me
what's going on with you.

20:21.654 --> 20:23.656
You said you got invited
to a Hindu wedding?

20:23.656 --> 20:25.725
Yeah, do you want
the short version

20:25.725 --> 20:27.660
or the long version?

20:27.660 --> 20:29.228
The long version.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.897
And start from the beginning.

20:30.897 --> 20:34.000
(Caitlin)
Mom, it was so beautiful
and over-the-top.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.503
The whole village was there--
like, 500 people.

20:37.305 --> 20:43.684
