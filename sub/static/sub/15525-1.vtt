00:41.542 --> 00:45.298
- Lovely.
- That is for sure.

00:45.578 --> 00:47.273
So this is the country?

00:48.114 --> 00:50.675
Listen to the underprivileged
child back there, will you?

00:52.218 --> 00:55.244
- There it is, darling. 17 Shore Road.
- Yeah, I got it.

01:25.883 --> 01:28.443
- Are you all right, Davey?
- I'm fine.

01:28.552 --> 01:30.217
Oh my God!

01:34.391 --> 01:35.789
Is that our house?

01:36.693 --> 01:39.025
No Davey, that's not our house.

01:41.130 --> 01:42.791
It can't be our house.

01:56.778 --> 01:58.395
What a waste.

02:19.033 --> 02:21.695
Well, it said "suitable
for a large family".

02:22.670 --> 02:24.035
It's so big!

02:27.007 --> 02:28.269
Marian.

02:29.809 --> 02:35.768
Will you be sensible, maybe? Now you don't
rent a house like this for a reasonable...

02:36.383 --> 02:39.216
I mean there must be a gate house
or guest room or something...

02:39.319 --> 02:40.843
No, this is it.

02:43.489 --> 02:46.253
Well there's only one way we
can find out, isn't there.

02:48.694 --> 02:51.530
"Onward into the valley of death,
rode the six hundred..."

03:03.174 --> 03:04.835
I hope they're in.

03:35.404 --> 03:38.290
Oh, we're the Rolf's.
We've come about the summer place.

03:38.407 --> 03:40.341
I know, I know - I've been expecting y'all!

03:40.443 --> 03:43.708
My name's Walker, and I'm the handyman.
I keep everything spick and span.

03:43.813 --> 03:46.976
Y'all come on in. Come on in, ma'am.
Come on in! Come on in, boy!

03:56.458 --> 03:59.393
- How d'ya like it?
- Oh, it's...

04:02.163 --> 04:05.321
Look, is this the place
they're talking about renting?

04:05.334 --> 04:06.390
It sure is!

04:06.800 --> 04:09.109
It's pretty, ain't it? Beautiful, ain't it?
Ya'll come on

04:09.122 --> 04:11.362
in the sitting room. Come on
in the sittin room, ma'am.

04:11.939 --> 04:14.670
Just turn around on here, and
make yourself at home right here.

04:16.209 --> 04:19.976
Just make yourselves right at home,
while I go and get the Neb's.

04:22.383 --> 04:24.873
Boy, you watch that furniture, ya hear?

04:33.126 --> 04:35.385
- I don't believe it.
- Me neither.

04:36.562 --> 04:39.224
Can I go outside for a
while and mess around?

04:46.972 --> 04:48.599
You don't have to come, you know.

04:48.707 --> 04:50.768
No I don't want to come, but
you stay around here, right?

04:50.781 --> 04:51.571
OK.

04:51.677 --> 04:53.872
- Hey, you hear what I say?
- Yeah, I heard you.

06:02.844 --> 06:04.505
What are you doing?

06:05.078 --> 06:07.706
Such a waste!
It kills me.

06:14.421 --> 06:19.246
- You musn't take things so personally.
- I can't help it.

06:20.560 --> 06:22.584
- Where's Davey?
- He's outside.

06:24.029 --> 06:26.594
Do you mind if I shut the
door to keep the stench out?

06:26.607 --> 06:27.465
No.

06:30.035 --> 06:31.832
Marian, look at this.

06:32.505 --> 06:34.939
- This is extraordinary.
- How beautiful.

06:35.174 --> 06:37.074
Yeah, but they're all the same!

06:37.276 --> 06:40.210
This one must be what, 100 years old?

06:40.512 --> 06:42.810
This one's quite recent.

06:51.356 --> 06:52.584
Yeah, but why?

06:53.090 --> 06:55.524
Here they are!

06:56.994 --> 06:59.292
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

07:00.197 --> 07:02.222
It's been quite a morning.

07:03.233 --> 07:08.170
If your busy schedule permits, would you
mind taking the mirror out? It's cracked.

07:09.940 --> 07:14.237
- Ain't the only thing cracked around here.
- Old fool.

07:14.877 --> 07:16.708
Grouchy old bastard.

07:21.484 --> 07:26.571
I'm Roz Allardyce. My brother will be down
just as soon as he pulls himself together.

07:26.722 --> 07:28.514
We're the Rolf's.
My name is Ben.

07:28.717 --> 07:30.483
My wife, Marian.

07:30.592 --> 07:31.991
How do you do.

07:32.227 --> 07:33.823
There's a boy
too, isn't there?

07:33.836 --> 07:36.058
Yes, our son, David.
He's out in the garden.

07:36.198 --> 07:40.659
- Is that all right?
- Oh yes. Children are good for the place.

07:44.239 --> 07:47.969
Well, I suppose we'd better
get down to details?

07:49.009 --> 07:51.136
Ah, a practical man. Just like brother.

07:51.912 --> 07:53.470
The ad did say "reasonable".

07:53.612 --> 07:57.670
"Very reasonable", as I recall.
And so it is, for the right people.

08:00.554 --> 08:04.649
Well, assuming we are the "right people",
what would your idea of "reasonable" be?

08:05.358 --> 08:09.988
Well, I'd like to ask you
a few questions first.

08:10.096 --> 08:12.326
Would you be taking the
house by yourselves?

08:12.432 --> 08:14.593
Well, no. There's Ben's aunt, Elizabeth.

08:15.802 --> 08:17.827
- How old?
- She's 74.

08:18.471 --> 08:22.998
An old gal then?
You wouldn't mind having an old gal around?

08:23.108 --> 08:25.303
Oh no.
Elizabeth is a doll.

08:26.812 --> 08:30.407
And you'll take the place from
the 1st of July until Labour Day

08:30.782 --> 08:33.376
and you'll keep the place
and you'll tend it?

08:34.285 --> 08:36.379
By ourselves? I mean, alone?

08:37.121 --> 08:38.315
Well, yes.

08:40.591 --> 08:42.616
I don't know,
with a house this size

08:42.727 --> 08:44.820
and only my wife, I don't
know that we'd be...

08:44.929 --> 08:48.831
The house takes care of itself,
Mr. Rolf.

08:49.667 --> 08:50.929
Believe me.

08:51.435 --> 08:54.669
I hate to make an issue
of this but...

08:55.539 --> 08:58.640
...will you love the house
as brother and I do?

08:59.442 --> 09:02.240
Oh yes. I think we will.

09:04.614 --> 09:07.583
Then we're talking in the
neighbourhood of 900 dollars.

09:07.684 --> 09:10.166
Look, I don't know that I'm
going be able to make that...

09:10.179 --> 09:11.175
For the whole Summer.

09:14.189 --> 09:15.281
Help! Help!

09:15.624 --> 09:16.682
Ah, that's brother.

09:16.792 --> 09:18.783
- Walker, Walker, for Christ's sake!
- Oh dear.

09:20.095 --> 09:23.826
- Hold your horses, I'm coming!
- The damn stairlift is broken again.

09:25.100 --> 09:27.068
- It's moving! It's moving!
- Excuse me.

09:27.735 --> 09:28.861
I want down!

09:28.970 --> 09:31.165
Unbelievable, isn't it?

09:31.506 --> 09:35.033
It's an absolute steal! There's no
question, is there darling. We'll grab it.

09:35.143 --> 09:38.237
- Look, sweetheart, I don't really...
- But darling, we'd be crazy not to!

09:38.368 --> 09:41.711
Well if we were we'd be in step with them,
wouldn't we. Look at them all, they're...

09:41.916 --> 09:44.205
The man's an absolute
idiot, and we've got to

09:44.218 --> 09:46.368
get rid of him! Do you understand?
Do you?

09:47.421 --> 09:51.551
This is my brother, Arnold.
As you can see, he's full of beans today.

09:51.825 --> 09:55.659
So you are the people who want to
rent this house, is that right?

09:56.830 --> 10:00.231
Yes, we were just discussing terms
with your, um, lady.

10:01.267 --> 10:04.395
Oh, I like them Roz, I like them.

10:04.570 --> 10:07.665
- There's a boy, too.
- Yes, our son, David.

10:07.807 --> 10:10.605
- He's playing in the garden.
- Really? Show me.

10:11.844 --> 10:14.039
Hurry, Roz, I want to see.

10:15.748 --> 10:18.307
Ah, there he is!
Isn't he darling.

10:20.819 --> 10:24.721
Oh God, what a charming little boy.
How old is he, eight or nine?

10:24.823 --> 10:28.520
- No, 12.
- 12? Isn't he sweet.

10:32.230 --> 10:34.460
He's full of the Devil too, isn't he?

10:38.202 --> 10:40.643
Oh I'm sorry, maybe he
shouldn't be walking around...

10:40.656 --> 10:42.935
No no, leave him alone, he's fine.
He's just fine!

10:45.042 --> 10:47.670
- Do you rent often?
- It depends.

10:47.878 --> 10:51.155
Oh, what my sister's
trying to say is that we

10:51.168 --> 10:54.671
have this desperate need
of rest and relaxation.

10:56.753 --> 10:58.812
I'm coming apart, as you can see...

10:58.921 --> 11:01.788
- Oh, brother...
- Oh, brother is right.

11:03.292 --> 11:05.319
Well, do you like it?

11:05.995 --> 11:08.259
- We love it.
- Really?

11:09.464 --> 11:11.697
God, when it comes alive.
Tell them, brother.

11:11.710 --> 11:13.662
Tell them what it's
like in the Summer.

11:15.437 --> 11:17.849
Well, they'd never believe it.
It's beyond

11:17.862 --> 11:20.397
anything that you've
ever seen in your life.

11:21.276 --> 11:25.644
There's centuries in this room, Mrs. Rolf.

11:26.380 --> 11:29.281
- There are years, years in this house.
- Oh yes.

11:31.218 --> 11:33.735
And this house will be
here long, long after

11:33.748 --> 11:35.882
you have departed,
do you believe me.

11:38.192 --> 11:40.217
It's practically immortal.

11:40.628 --> 11:43.790
- I sincerely believe that.
- So do I.

11:48.168 --> 11:51.160
Oh, I know that must seem funny to you.

11:52.138 --> 11:55.835
But when people love a house the way
my brother and I love this one...

11:56.142 --> 11:59.668
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be rude,
it's just that...

11:59.845 --> 12:01.870
...well, I was waiting for the catch.

12:03.048 --> 12:04.174
Catch?

12:05.984 --> 12:08.009
Well, you mean it's 900 dollars and...

12:08.660 --> 12:10.245
...and then it's all ours?

12:10.359 --> 12:13.552
Oh, of course there is one other thing.

12:14.193 --> 12:17.389
- But it's hardly a catch.
- No, it's not a catch.

12:17.995 --> 12:19.753
It's our mother.

12:21.933 --> 12:23.757
What about her?

12:24.335 --> 12:27.862
An 85 year old woman who could pass for 60.

12:28.973 --> 12:31.168
Yes now, what she's trying to say is...

12:31.843 --> 12:34.367
that our mother never,
ever leaves the house.

12:34.478 --> 12:38.376
Well she never leaves her
room actually, isn't that so?

12:39.014 --> 12:40.650
Oh, she'll be no trouble at all.

12:41.384 --> 12:47.182
No, you'll probably never even see her.
She sleeps most of the time.

12:47.991 --> 12:50.371
And when she's not
sleeping, she's listening

12:50.384 --> 12:52.668
to her music or working
on her collection.

12:52.962 --> 12:58.626
Yes, her pictures, or old photos. You
see, she has literally thousands of them.

12:59.502 --> 13:01.732
Memories of a lifetime.

13:02.271 --> 13:04.000
She is our darling.

13:04.707 --> 13:07.894
And all you'd have to do is
prepare a tray, three times a

13:07.907 --> 13:11.105
day, and just leave it on the table.
In her sitting room.

13:12.882 --> 13:14.247
Look...

13:14.648 --> 13:20.248
Do you mind very much if we go home,
maybe think about it and let you know...

13:20.262 --> 13:22.983
- Ben, no!
- Thank you very much.

13:23.957 --> 13:25.424
- Mom.
- Davey?

13:26.626 --> 13:28.326
Davey, what happened?

13:29.396 --> 13:31.956
- I just cut my knee.
- That looks nasty!

13:32.065 --> 13:35.501
- What happened there?
- I fell off a thing out there.

13:35.636 --> 13:38.605
You better wash off his poor little cuts.

13:39.873 --> 13:41.965
Let's go out to the kitchen.

13:44.110 --> 13:47.341
- Come on, I have some band-aids.
- Come on, darling.

13:59.691 --> 14:02.182
Where are you going with that plant?

14:03.929 --> 14:05.897
Josie said it was dead!

14:06.932 --> 14:08.160
Did she?

14:08.967 --> 14:10.559
Well look again.

14:16.907 --> 14:18.670
Huh! Ain't that somethin'.

14:31.988 --> 14:34.479
I thought you were impossibly rude.

14:36.226 --> 14:37.686
Was I?

14:40.096 --> 14:42.963
Oh come on, sweetheart. Someone should
go in there with a large butterfly net.

14:43.066 --> 14:45.466
They got carried away,
that's all.

14:47.337 --> 14:49.099
Not yet, they didn't.

14:55.777 --> 14:59.008
You do not rent an estate
like that for 900 dollars.

14:59.414 --> 15:00.642
Why not?

15:01.683 --> 15:03.792
Maybe they're not
interested in money. Maybe

15:03.805 --> 15:06.113
they want someone who'll
take care of the place.

15:06.254 --> 15:07.221
Just be there.

15:07.455 --> 15:10.583
Well all right, maybe. But you don't need
a 90 year old woman just to...

15:10.691 --> 15:12.591
85.

15:12.693 --> 15:16.151
85 or 185, what's the difference.

15:16.264 --> 15:19.859
You don't leave an old lady like that
with two complete strangers.

15:20.568 --> 15:26.161
You wouldn't have to worry about her.
She'd be my responsibility.

15:27.374 --> 15:30.775
- Oh yeah, sure. And what if she's to die?
- Oh my God.

15:42.054 --> 15:44.045
Does it really mean that much to you?

15:45.924 --> 15:47.551
You know it does.

15:49.194 --> 15:50.661
I'll survive.

15:55.733 --> 16:00.345
The question is... will
I be able to survive.

16:16.119 --> 16:17.381
Allardyce.

16:17.854 --> 16:19.481
Yes, Mr. Rolf.

16:20.424 --> 16:24.383
Marvellous.
Brother will be so pleased!

16:25.962 --> 16:27.344
July 1st.

16:27.964 --> 16:31.694
We'll have everything ready.
Thank you. Bye.

16:51.453 --> 16:56.180
- Are you comfortable back there?
- No! Just about everything in me is numb!

16:57.692 --> 17:00.217
Except of course your mouth, auntie.

17:02.930 --> 17:06.798
Oh Benji, I forgot to tell you.
I renewed my learner's permit.

17:06.900 --> 17:08.595
I am determined this time.

17:08.702 --> 17:11.671
Well, I must admit I admire
your persistence, auntie.

17:11.771 --> 17:15.674
Well my persistence is the reason
I have flourished this long.

17:16.743 --> 17:20.201
All you've got to do, auntie,
is learn to relax at the wheel.

17:20.313 --> 17:24.715
I always relax at the wheel.
I get nervous inspectors!

17:55.813 --> 17:58.081
We'll have lots of room.

18:03.387 --> 18:05.150
I can't get over it.

18:05.589 --> 18:07.352
Beautiful, isn't it.

18:13.596 --> 18:15.337
Looks deserted.

18:16.966 --> 18:18.228
Can't be.

18:33.582 --> 18:35.482
What's the matter, something wrong?

18:35.851 --> 18:37.318
They had to leave.

18:40.556 --> 18:41.716
Leave?

18:48.563 --> 18:54.127
"Enjoy the house and don't worry about
anything. Arnold and Roz Allardyce. "

18:55.736 --> 18:57.966
- Jesus Christ.
- I know, it's crazy.

18:58.072 --> 19:00.438
What if something goes wrong,
where do we reach them?

19:00.541 --> 19:03.532
They do crazy things sometimes, old people.

19:04.110 --> 19:08.410
Yes they do, don't they.
But these two are two steps beyond crazy.

19:08.815 --> 19:12.216
- And what about the old lady?
- I'll look in on her.

19:16.356 --> 19:19.080
You do that. It's your department.
David! Bags.

19:36.508 --> 19:40.376
- Marian, I can't believe it!
- And it's all ours.

19:42.046 --> 19:43.536
Be right there.

20:59.485 --> 21:00.952
Mrs. Allardyce?

21:04.257 --> 21:07.055
It's Marian Rolf.
We're the new tenants.

21:09.662 --> 21:11.323
Are you all right?

21:15.735 --> 21:17.827
Is there anything you need?

22:26.968 --> 22:28.902
Memories of a lifetime.

23:40.437 --> 23:42.302
Marian, where are you?

23:53.683 --> 23:57.119
- What have you been doing up there?
- I've been getting her tray.

23:57.453 --> 24:00.388
- Have you seen her? What's she like?
- She's asleep.

24:00.623 --> 24:02.352
We'll see her later.

24:06.928 --> 24:08.919
Now, listen. Both of you.

24:09.164 --> 24:12.327
These stairs are out of bounds
to anyone but me, all right?

24:12.901 --> 24:16.803
Mrs. Allardyce is a very old lady
and she's my responsibility.

24:17.439 --> 24:19.873
I don't want anyone bothering her.

24:22.843 --> 24:24.071
Crushing.

24:24.178 --> 24:27.773
- Hey you guys! Come see what I found!
- What are you talking about?

24:27.882 --> 24:30.544
Come on, I'll show you!
It's in the kitchen!

24:30.651 --> 24:32.141
Let's go look.

24:33.654 --> 24:38.387
None of the clocks are working.
It's a pity, they're all so lovely.

24:38.626 --> 24:41.685
Probably need winding.
Just wait til I get to work.

24:41.795 --> 24:44.821
You can't wait to get into your
knee pads and jock straps, can you.

24:44.931 --> 24:46.899
- Benji!
- Oh auntie.

24:55.041 --> 24:56.132
Isn't it great?

24:56.241 --> 24:59.540
- Great.
- Aunt Elizabeth, look at this!

25:03.782 --> 25:05.875
My God, it's got everything!

25:08.086 --> 25:11.681
Benji, here's your first job!
Needs a new bulb.

25:11.990 --> 25:13.149
Right.

25:14.158 --> 25:16.854
So they're crazy are they, darling?
So they're weird, huh?

25:16.961 --> 25:19.930
Yeah well, this is the kind
of crazy I can live with.

25:21.399 --> 25:24.698
- God damn it..
- Benji! In front of the child...

25:24.802 --> 25:26.927
I'll go see about Mrs.
Allardyce's lunch, OK? You

25:26.940 --> 25:28.863
guys just fix a nice
spread of sandwiches...

25:29.293 --> 25:32.601
- Marvellous, give it to me!
- I always said he had it down.

25:39.649 --> 25:40.980
Did you see those antiques?

25:41.084 --> 25:42.779
Hey, I think I see some Ding Dongs!

25:42.886 --> 25:45.753
<i>Aunt Elizabeth, did you ever see
so many priceless antiques?</i>

25:45.956 --> 25:47.846
Hey, they are Ding Dongs!

25:49.291 --> 25:50.849
A whole case of them!

25:50.993 --> 25:53.553
<i>How about a little
toast to the house, eh?</i>

27:05.376 --> 27:07.310
- Hey, slave!
- Hi!

27:09.734 --> 27:12.395
This is fantastic,
what have you been doing?

27:12.670 --> 27:13.694
Where did you get this from?

27:13.804 --> 27:16.500
That is the same one that was rolled up
against the wall.

27:16.607 --> 27:18.507
You like it?
It's worth a fortune.

27:18.609 --> 27:20.270
- I'll get that.
- Thanks, sweetheart.

27:20.377 --> 27:22.174
You did all this by yourself since we left?

27:22.279 --> 27:25.339
And there's more upstairs, I'll
have you know. How was town?

27:26.116 --> 27:27.707
Oh, it was great, great...

27:28.418 --> 27:30.943
Capital of nowhere, if
you know what I mean.

27:31.054 --> 27:34.854
- Put those sacks in the kitchen.
- Yeah, "put the bags in the kitchen"

27:34.958 --> 27:38.985
Hey why don't you come and watch us fix the
pool, that should be some kind of a laugh.

27:39.495 --> 27:40.587
Busy, busy, busy!

28:05.019 --> 28:07.419
Aren't you finished with that thing yet?

28:08.122 --> 28:11.922
Listen, if you're so God damn smart why
don't you come up here and fix it yourself?

28:12.026 --> 28:14.426
Davey, go show your father
how to do it.

28:14.829 --> 28:16.421
All right then, I will!

28:17.098 --> 28:21.058
Will you quit trying to undermine
my parental authority, old lady?

28:23.269 --> 28:25.897
Rather that than go down there and
shoving it up of that old sewer.

28:26.006 --> 28:29.373
Yeah, which is kind of why I'm
trying to get this model work.

28:33.580 --> 28:34.672
- Father.
- Yeah.

28:35.280 --> 28:37.111
Come here. Come on, come here!

28:39.418 --> 28:43.115
See, there's a little object on
this machines called a cut off.

28:44.356 --> 28:46.415
There it is.
Go on, try it.

28:48.327 --> 28:51.057
- Do you think it will work?
- I'll bet on it.

28:51.530 --> 28:53.861
- How much will you bet?
- 5 dollars.

29:05.443 --> 29:08.503
Benji, you're a mechanical genius!

29:28.664 --> 29:30.529
Hey look, it's a graveyard!

29:53.688 --> 29:57.283
Hey dad! Hey, come look what I found!
It's an old bike!

30:00.994 --> 30:05.062
You know something, Davey?
They're all Allardyce's.

30:05.866 --> 30:09.495
And I haven't been able to find
one any newer than the 1890's.

30:10.104 --> 30:11.503
Bit spooky, eh?

30:15.109 --> 30:18.202
Would you like some candy, little boy?

30:21.681 --> 30:22.702
Leave me alone!

30:22.715 --> 30:25.811
You can't run away from
me, little boy! Ha ha ha!

30:59.250 --> 31:00.774
Mrs. Allardyce?

31:02.353 --> 31:04.014
Are you all right?

31:05.556 --> 31:07.022
I am very worried about you.

31:07.123 --> 31:10.524
We've been here over a week,
and you've barely eaten anything.

31:12.762 --> 31:15.087
Is it that you don't like
what I've been bringing

31:15.100 --> 31:17.062
you? It's what Roz
wanted me to give you.

31:21.704 --> 31:25.662
Do you go down to the kitchen at night?
Is that's what you've been doing?

31:26.408 --> 31:29.605
Mrs. Allardyce,
if you would at least speak to me.

31:46.827 --> 31:49.853
Where's mom? She said she was
gonna come with us, didn't she?

31:49.964 --> 31:52.057
Yeah well, you know your mother don't you.

31:52.466 --> 31:54.331
How's your wind hanging on?

31:54.869 --> 31:56.769
Not what it used to be.

31:57.305 --> 32:00.535
- You smoke too much, you know that?
- I know.

32:01.007 --> 32:02.872
And I drink too much.

32:03.176 --> 32:07.078
And I am a lecherous old lady
and I'll never make 80.

32:35.373 --> 32:38.740
Did you put the chlorine in the pool?
I mean, you know that does kill the germs.

32:38.843 --> 32:41.317
Yeah well, I'm not too
interested in the germs.

32:41.330 --> 32:43.712
You see, it's the sea
serpent I'm after, boy.

32:45.537 --> 32:47.505
Well, when can we go swimming?

32:49.586 --> 32:52.282
Why don't you go and ask your mother first.

32:53.390 --> 32:55.858
- Go on, double double double!
- I'm going.

33:37.365 --> 33:38.627
<i>Hey mom!</i>

33:40.100 --> 33:42.295
<i>Hey mom, are you up there?</i>

33:44.338 --> 33:46.966
<i>It's time to go swimming with us, mom.</i>

33:58.885 --> 34:02.048
I couldn't find her anywhere.
I searched the whole house!

34:02.155 --> 34:04.885
Don't worry,
she's probably on the john.

34:22.873 --> 34:24.341
Isn't that great?

34:42.893 --> 34:44.724
That was a great dive, dad!

34:44.829 --> 34:48.264
- Oh Benji, you should be in the Olympics.
- Right, right...

35:03.213 --> 35:04.770
Hey, what is that?

35:07.516 --> 35:09.381
Nothing boy, nothing.

35:10.686 --> 35:12.119
Yeah well, I'm coming out!

35:12.221 --> 35:14.587
All right Benny, you
might be a great ball

35:14.600 --> 35:17.088
player, but you float
like a rock, got that?

35:17.426 --> 35:19.519
Yeah well, I'm coming out anyhow.

35:22.397 --> 35:25.230
Davey!
That is deep water!

35:25.733 --> 35:27.200
Now stop showing off.

35:29.470 --> 35:31.233
Dad, it's a sea serpent!

35:39.379 --> 35:40.539
No no, help!

35:51.591 --> 35:53.990
- Wanna play then Davey, eh?
- Yeah.

35:54.093 --> 35:55.788
- What is it, witless?
- OK.

35:55.895 --> 35:58.295
You clutch on my shoulders, OK?

36:03.068 --> 36:04.296
Ben, no!

36:06.138 --> 36:07.087
That was fun!

36:07.088 --> 36:10.000
- You like that? Wanna do it again?
- OK.

36:12.510 --> 36:15.775
All right now, you two.
It's quite enough.

36:19.984 --> 36:22.646
Benji, you're worse
than a spoiled child.

36:22.754 --> 36:25.689
- That was really hard.
- You like that, Davey?

36:55.051 --> 36:56.780
What are you doing?

37:02.924 --> 37:04.482
Benji, stop it!

37:08.597 --> 37:12.426
Ben, my God!
You're hurting him!

40:31.988 --> 40:33.512
Ben, it's after 2:00.

40:36.259 --> 40:37.419
Is it?

40:41.096 --> 40:42.586
Did you sleep?

40:43.999 --> 40:46.991
- Yeah, some.
- Want to come back and try again?

40:48.503 --> 40:50.164
Well, in a while maybe.

40:56.912 --> 41:00.813
- You don't have to smoke in here, do you?
- Why, is it wrong for the room?

41:06.353 --> 41:08.548
Ben. You didn't mean to hurt Davey.

41:09.590 --> 41:12.787
- The roughhouse just got out of hand.
- Roughhouse...

41:13.928 --> 41:16.361
You weren't there Marian, for Christ sake.

41:17.964 --> 41:19.397
No, I wasn't.

41:22.035 --> 41:23.764
I'm sorry, you see...

41:25.238 --> 41:29.706
It's all I can think of.
I can't get it out of my head.

41:31.478 --> 41:33.377
Ben, I know you.

41:34.146 --> 41:37.240
- So I know you didn't mean to do that.
- The hell I didn't, Marian!

41:37.349 --> 41:40.318
I wanted to hurt him, do you
understand that? I wanted to hurt him.

41:40.419 --> 41:45.644
You're punishing yourself.
Davey is all right. He's all right!

41:48.493 --> 41:51.690
What if it's more serious
than you think it is?

41:53.464 --> 41:55.056
What do you mean?

41:59.637 --> 42:02.868
Those dreams I had about
my mother's... you know...

42:05.642 --> 42:07.371
...they're coming back, Marian.

42:10.280 --> 42:13.977
Darling, that was such
a very long time ago.

42:16.386 --> 42:20.784
There's nothing wrong with you.
Absolutely nothing.

43:43.034 --> 43:44.699
My God!

43:45.737 --> 43:51.247
It's completely changed.
It's all new again.

44:03.187 --> 44:05.677
It's all yours.
You like it?

44:08.691 --> 44:09.885
Yeah, it's great.

44:09.993 --> 44:12.938
I took away the television, it
was wrong for the room anyway.

44:13.073 --> 44:15.246
 You should
forgive the expression.

44:19.602 --> 44:22.331
All we've got to do now
is just find something for me to do.

44:22.437 --> 44:25.338
Oh darling, there's loads for you to do.

44:25.674 --> 44:29.041
Now's a good a time as any
to start on your doctorate.

44:31.079 --> 44:35.479
- Benji. It's all right, isn't it?
- What, the room?

44:37.652 --> 44:42.244
No, yesterday.
It's a long time ago.

44:42.757 --> 44:45.851
Let's just forget it
and start over again, OK?

44:55.201 --> 44:59.463
Oh, how nice.
David has decided to take up painting.

45:00.006 --> 45:02.304
We're off to search out a view.

45:09.749 --> 45:11.010
Hi, Davey.

45:16.855 --> 45:21.516
- How is everything?
- Okay.

45:22.861 --> 45:27.259
- Did you take your paints, Davey?
- Yeah.

45:31.469 --> 45:35.249
- We're still friends?
- Oh dad!

45:37.442 --> 45:41.946
- I never want to go back to that pool.
- No, you won't have to Davey.

45:42.387 --> 45:44.718
I promise you won't have to.

46:23.952 --> 46:26.580
I don't like going to bed without you.

46:29.991 --> 46:32.721
It's been a while since I was down here.

46:34.195 --> 46:36.388
- Hasn't it?
- Yes, I know.

46:48.375 --> 46:52.558
Well, at least the filter seems
to be working, doesn't it?

46:52.571 --> 46:54.633
Yes, attribute to a genius.

46:57.450 --> 46:59.247
The rest of it, it's all...

47:00.086 --> 47:01.849
It seems to be all...

47:01.954 --> 47:03.717
Smell of lemon oil?

47:04.157 --> 47:08.423
I plucked the weeds, I polished the chrome.
I scrubbed the concrete.

47:11.363 --> 47:13.024
What is it, honey?

47:15.534 --> 47:18.128
Do you know I had to come down here to...

47:19.571 --> 47:20.868
...well, to see if I could.

47:25.610 --> 47:28.772
I thought we were going to
forget about all that.

47:29.213 --> 47:30.776
We tried, didn't we.

47:38.923 --> 47:41.990
You seem to have landed
yourself with a bit of a kook.

47:42.003 --> 47:43.623
Well, that makes two of us.

47:49.899 --> 47:52.732
Looks marvellous,
why don't you jump in?

47:55.371 --> 47:58.932
- Will you come with me?
- Oh, I don't have my suit.

47:59.942 --> 48:02.740
Well then, why don't you
take your clothes off?

48:05.447 --> 48:07.176
What if I go first?

48:16.658 --> 48:18.557
Come on in.
It's great.

48:19.160 --> 48:22.891
- Will it aid in the therapy?
- It'll aid the therapy.

48:24.632 --> 48:25.826
Oh, why not.

48:28.102 --> 48:29.867
Everything.

48:44.584 --> 48:45.642
Come here.

48:51.190 --> 48:53.684
It's been a long time between visits.

48:56.990 --> 48:58.784
I miss them.

49:05.538 --> 49:07.767
None of that stuff now, honey.

49:08.606 --> 49:10.335
A little water sport.

49:10.742 --> 49:13.734
It's very good for the
circulation, you know.

49:15.480 --> 49:17.345
My circulation's fine.

49:23.855 --> 49:25.185
Come back!

49:26.223 --> 49:28.555
- Marian?
- Not on your life.

49:45.308 --> 49:49.010
Look, I'm not saying it's going to be
dynamite after 13 years.

49:50.179 --> 49:53.671
But surely some semblance of excitement...

50:03.024 --> 50:07.461
I can't work out what's made me
so repulsive all of a sudden.

50:09.130 --> 50:10.461
Repulsive?

50:11.800 --> 50:13.700
You're incredibly sexy.

50:49.034 --> 50:51.195
Ben, I don't want to!

50:53.739 --> 50:56.303
Not here. Not here, you can't.

50:59.111 --> 51:01.203
Marian, for God's sake.

51:01.246 --> 51:03.737
Please. You don't understand.

51:04.449 --> 51:07.383
You mustn't. Please!

52:38.738 --> 52:40.000
Morning!

52:47.645 --> 52:50.219
- Where did you get that?
- Hall closet.

52:50.515 --> 52:52.747
This house is full of treasures.

52:54.886 --> 52:58.083
You didn't come to bed at
all last night, did you?

53:01.960 --> 53:03.950
After the pool...

53:05.596 --> 53:09.555
I went up to Mrs. Allardyce's room
to see if she needed anything.

53:10.367 --> 53:12.656
And I don't know how it
happened, I just fell

53:12.669 --> 53:15.270
asleep in a wing chair. I
guess I was pretty tired.

53:23.980 --> 53:25.743
Where are you going?

53:27.817 --> 53:31.514
Oh, I'm going to... trim
the drive or something.

54:05.286 --> 54:07.880
Well what happened to you?
It's nearly lunchtime.

54:07.988 --> 54:11.855
Goodness! Can't anyone ever
oversleep in this family?

54:12.625 --> 54:15.009
I just mean it's not like
you, aunt Elizabeth.

54:15.022 --> 54:17.009
You've got more energy
than any of us.

54:17.281 --> 54:21.455
Had. I'm afraid this Summer
vacation is wearing me out.

54:22.001 --> 54:25.402
Too much sun.
Why don't you try painting in the shade?

54:26.406 --> 54:29.597
My God!
I need a beauty parlour.

54:32.611 --> 54:34.540
Don't be silly.

54:37.049 --> 54:39.609
I'm not the only one who could use
the beauty parlour.

54:39.818 --> 54:42.427
You're getting quite a bit
of grey in your hair, Marian.

54:42.440 --> 54:43.312
I know.

54:43.856 --> 54:46.207
I think I take after my aunt Mary.

54:46.724 --> 54:50.251
You know, she went entirely grey
by the time she was 33.

54:52.864 --> 54:55.424
Oh! Davey's been looking for you.
He wants to go hiking.

54:57.168 --> 54:58.635
What's funny?

54:59.036 --> 55:01.402
Oh, me. Do you know what
I want to do right now?

55:01.415 --> 55:02.207
No?

55:03.306 --> 55:05.900
I want to go right back up to bed.

55:07.210 --> 55:10.637
- Isn't that awful?
- Certainly not.

55:11.214 --> 55:14.843
Why don't you go up there and take a nap?
It'll be good for you.

55:19.255 --> 55:20.745
Maybe I will.

55:57.190 --> 55:58.782
Damn it, I won't!

56:38.830 --> 56:42.425
Oh for Heaven's sake, Elizabeth,
what is wrong with you?

57:06.155 --> 57:08.089
Mrs. Allardyce?

57:08.791 --> 57:10.258
May I come in?

57:14.130 --> 57:16.428
Marian, I didn't know you were in there.

57:16.699 --> 57:18.327
What happened to your nap?

57:18.533 --> 57:22.333
Well I thought it about time I
introduced myself to our benefactor.

57:22.771 --> 57:24.102
She's asleep.

57:25.641 --> 57:27.131
Oh, that's too bad.

57:27.609 --> 57:31.807
I thought she might enjoy seeing
my picture.

57:31.980 --> 57:35.107
I'm sure she would dear, when she's awake.

57:36.250 --> 57:38.827
Elizabeth, I'm right in
the middle of something.

57:38.840 --> 57:41.784
Oh I'm sorry dear, I didn't
mean to interrupt anything.

57:42.923 --> 57:46.020
- You tell her I came to visit.
- I know she'll appreciate it.

57:46.227 --> 57:49.553
- And if she ever wants any company...
- I'll let her know. OK?

57:51.464 --> 57:53.056
Well, be careful on the steps.

57:53.166 --> 57:57.361
Now you just go back to your work.
I'll be all right.

01:01:49.483 --> 01:01:50.853
Davey!

01:02:23.587 --> 01:02:25.851
- What is it, what's wrong?
- Gas.

01:02:26.823 --> 01:02:30.486
- Oh my God! Well is he all right!?
- Yes, he's breathing.

01:02:31.428 --> 01:02:32.986
Breathe in, boy.

01:02:39.769 --> 01:02:42.533
Here, hold him. I'll be right back.

01:02:45.074 --> 01:02:46.184
Breathe the air now.

01:03:17.705 --> 01:03:20.640
- Are you all right, Davey?
- I think he's better.

01:03:21.909 --> 01:03:23.706
What has happened, Benji?

01:03:24.712 --> 01:03:26.475
That damn gas heater...

01:03:27.181 --> 01:03:32.177
I just don't understand how it happened.
How could it have happened?

01:03:44.263 --> 01:03:46.253
Have you had any breakfast, dear?

01:03:46.865 --> 01:03:49.891
No, I overslept again.
A disgrace.

01:03:50.936 --> 01:03:53.564
- How is Davey?
- Oh, everything's fine.

01:03:53.672 --> 01:03:57.372
Ben called from town.
Davey's all right, thank God.

01:03:57.976 --> 01:04:00.638
I can't imagine how frightened I was.

01:04:01.947 --> 01:04:03.538
Poor little Davey.

01:04:10.388 --> 01:04:13.915
I want you to know
I didn't touch that heater.

01:04:15.493 --> 01:04:18.893
- Well of course you didn't, dear.
- If I did, I'd remember.

01:04:20.563 --> 01:04:25.192
- Nobody said you did.
- I just covered him, that's all.

01:04:25.769 --> 01:04:29.102
You covered him? You mean you
were in David's room last night?

01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:34.574
Yes, I looked in on him.
Sometimes I don't sleep.

01:04:36.545 --> 01:04:39.309
Exactly what did you do
in his room, Elizabeth?

01:04:41.250 --> 01:04:44.151
I told you, I just covered him.
It was cold.

01:04:44.386 --> 01:04:46.820
This house is getting so cold.

01:04:47.689 --> 01:04:50.180
You know, David's door
is always open.

01:04:50.826 --> 01:04:52.793
Last night it was locked.

01:04:55.396 --> 01:04:56.988
Well, I didn't lock it.

01:04:58.232 --> 01:05:00.996
The only thing I touched
was the blanket.

01:05:05.573 --> 01:05:07.734
Well, that's all I remember doing.

01:05:08.643 --> 01:05:11.770
All right, you didn't lock it.
It locked itself!

01:05:12.879 --> 01:05:14.972
Now what about the windows?

01:05:15.982 --> 01:05:17.176
They were open.

01:05:17.284 --> 01:05:21.220
They were closed when Ben walked into
that room. Now make sense, Elizabeth!

01:05:22.589 --> 01:05:24.113
How can I?

01:05:25.925 --> 01:05:31.287
How can I... when you keep
shouting at me and accusing me?

01:05:31.797 --> 01:05:34.305
I'm not accusing you.

01:05:37.236 --> 01:05:38.601
Where's Ben?

01:05:39.438 --> 01:05:41.503
Benji will believe me.

01:05:43.441 --> 01:05:45.136
I believe you too.

01:05:45.343 --> 01:05:47.436
No, you don't.
It's obvious.

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:51.446
We all forget things, Elizabeth...

01:05:52.051 --> 01:05:54.440
and... at your age...

01:05:54.552 --> 01:05:59.169
I don't forget things!
I know what I do!

01:06:00.624 --> 01:06:03.115
Well, of course you do, dear.

01:06:04.628 --> 01:06:08.029
Now, why don't you just let me get you
some breakfast?

01:06:10.734 --> 01:06:13.396
But what about the old woman Mrs...

01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:16.405
Oh, I am so mixed up. Mrs. ...

01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:17.938
Allardyce.

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:20.868
- Yes, Allardyce. Maybe she...
- Aunt Elizabeth!

01:06:21.577 --> 01:06:23.369
Let's just forget this!

01:06:29.952 --> 01:06:32.017
Tell Ben I'm upstairs.

01:06:37.993 --> 01:06:40.655
I'll bring your breakfast to your room.

01:06:42.664 --> 01:06:44.598
Like you do to her room?

01:06:45.834 --> 01:06:48.234
The other old woman?

01:06:51.172 --> 01:06:53.231
No, no. Don't bother, Marian.

01:07:09.761 --> 01:07:10.951
Elizabeth.

01:07:13.761 --> 01:07:16.651
- Benji.
- Did I wake you?

01:07:24.970 --> 01:07:26.335
Are you all right?

01:07:29.641 --> 01:07:33.077
Do you feel up to a few little Martinis
on the terrace?

01:07:33.178 --> 01:07:35.476
Do you know what she said to me?

01:07:36.381 --> 01:07:39.773
Elizabeth, she was upset. I'm sure
she didn't mean what she was saying.

01:07:39.985 --> 01:07:42.748
She has no right
to talk to me like that.

01:07:43.387 --> 01:07:44.854
I would die...

01:07:46.891 --> 01:07:49.917
I would die
before I did anything to hurt Davey.

01:07:51.362 --> 01:07:54.889
Look, you two never had words before.
Why, all of a sudden?

01:07:55.533 --> 01:07:57.262
Well, ask your wife.

01:07:58.336 --> 01:08:03.462
- Maybe I am an old woman.
- Elizabeth, you are not old.

01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:07.706
But that doesn't mean that I've
lost all my marbles.

01:08:08.645 --> 01:08:14.337
If I had closed those windows or
locked that door, the way she said...

01:08:14.784 --> 01:08:16.978
I'm sure she didn't say that.

01:08:17.519 --> 01:08:19.384
I'd certainly remember...

01:08:19.921 --> 01:08:22.322
You don't forget things like that.

01:08:23.259 --> 01:08:26.854
I couldn't forget something as
important as that, could I?

01:08:29.598 --> 01:08:34.457
Oh I'm sorry, Benji.
But she's gotten me so upset.

01:08:36.638 --> 01:08:40.438
I don't like it here.
I want to leave this house.

01:08:41.142 --> 01:08:44.372
You feel the same way,
I know you do.

01:08:50.017 --> 01:08:52.383
Look Elizabeth, we're all upset.

01:08:52.819 --> 01:08:57.219
Now why don't you come downstairs
and have those drinks?

01:08:57.323 --> 01:09:01.260
Even if it's just a little chance
for Marian to say she's sorry.

01:09:02.296 --> 01:09:03.593
All right.

01:09:04.798 --> 01:09:07.060
But only for you, Benji.

01:09:09.135 --> 01:09:10.466
I love you.

01:09:11.636 --> 01:09:13.231
Do you know that?
I do.

01:09:40.363 --> 01:09:42.031
Ben, you scared me.

01:09:42.466 --> 01:09:45.367
Have you any idea just how
much you've hurt her?

01:09:46.804 --> 01:09:49.773
I'm sorry, but she was
in his room last night.

01:09:50.974 --> 01:09:52.669
Why should she lie, Marian?

01:09:53.477 --> 01:09:57.003
I didn't say that she lied.
She simply does not remember.

01:09:59.115 --> 01:10:03.381
And I suppose she's responsible for all
the other things that go on in this house?

01:10:07.657 --> 01:10:10.717
Well, I don't know what
that's supposed to mean.

01:10:11.527 --> 01:10:14.689
Now if you don't mind, I'd like
to go downstairs.

01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:17.196
Well, shouldn't I meet her first?

01:10:17.632 --> 01:10:20.965
- I mean, where is she?
- She's in her bedroom, asleep!

01:10:21.436 --> 01:10:23.734
Ben, she doesn't like anyone up here.

01:10:37.284 --> 01:10:38.979
Her... collection.

01:10:46.327 --> 01:10:49.022
Why don't you just let me lock up, dear?

01:10:49.896 --> 01:10:51.761
Why are you so nervous?

01:10:51.965 --> 01:10:55.196
I am not nervous.
I just wouldn't want to upset her.

01:10:55.402 --> 01:10:57.495
Why do you keep her door locked?

01:10:57.604 --> 01:11:00.402
She likes it that way.
She's an old woman.

01:11:01.307 --> 01:11:03.241
- She...
- Gave you the key?

01:11:06.678 --> 01:11:09.738
No, the key was in the envelope
the Allardyce's left.

01:11:11.717 --> 01:11:15.312
And were the keys belonging to all
those clocks in the same envelope?

01:11:15.988 --> 01:11:20.714
The keys to the clocks were in
the clock cases. Why do you ask?

01:11:21.592 --> 01:11:25.358
I just wonder whether you wound
all those clocks by yourself.

01:11:25.963 --> 01:11:27.294
That's all.

01:11:30.735 --> 01:11:32.566
Well, of course I did.

01:11:36.407 --> 01:11:39.304
What is this darling, a third degree?

01:11:41.311 --> 01:11:42.869
What's all this?

01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:47.082
Time to throw Ben a little something?
Keep him happy and out of your way?

01:11:47.984 --> 01:11:48.941
Is that what you think?

01:11:48.954 --> 01:11:51.317
To be perfectly frank Marian,
I don't know what to think.

01:11:52.322 --> 01:11:54.153
Maybe you can tell me.

01:11:56.625 --> 01:11:58.354
All right, I'll try.

01:11:59.695 --> 01:12:04.260
I'm sorry about the way I acted
at the pool the other night.

01:12:04.967 --> 01:12:07.367
I don't know why I acted that way.

01:12:10.039 --> 01:12:13.565
Perhaps you need a little more time
to work that one out.

01:12:23.146 --> 01:12:24.384
Davey, be care...

01:12:25.153 --> 01:12:26.484
Look what you did!

01:12:27.088 --> 01:12:29.851
- Don't you ever touch a thing!
- I didn't mean to do it!

01:12:29.957 --> 01:12:32.858
Don't you ever touch
a beautiful thing!

01:14:03.645 --> 01:14:05.489
- Ben, I...
- Marian, what is happening to you?

01:14:05.790 --> 01:14:07.398
Absolutely nothing.

01:14:07.433 --> 01:14:10.542
Then what the hell was that performance
with Davey back in there!

01:14:14.322 --> 01:14:16.017
This house just...

01:14:17.158 --> 01:14:19.456
...is more than I thought it would be.

01:14:20.061 --> 01:14:22.960
Marian, this house is
not yours, sweetheart.

01:14:22.973 --> 01:14:25.689
We do not own it, do
you understand that?

01:14:26.666 --> 01:14:30.124
But it's my responsibility for
as long as we're here, isn't it?

01:14:36.276 --> 01:14:38.767
Please be patient with me.
I need more time.

01:14:39.012 --> 01:14:42.709
More time for what?
To get more involved with all this?

01:14:43.515 --> 01:14:45.608
Marian, the Summer is almost over.

01:14:51.924 --> 01:14:55.257
- Do you mind if I ask you a question?
- Of course not.

01:14:56.595 --> 01:15:00.855
What's more important to you?
The house, all this...

01:15:01.866 --> 01:15:03.135
...or us?

01:15:04.802 --> 01:15:07.100
What kind of a question is that?

01:15:09.307 --> 01:15:11.798
All right, I'll put it another way.

01:15:13.011 --> 01:15:14.842
If I was to ask you...

01:15:15.847 --> 01:15:17.609
would you give it up?

01:15:18.649 --> 01:15:19.980
Give it up?

01:15:21.952 --> 01:15:23.010
Why?

01:15:26.657 --> 01:15:29.125
What if I hadn't reached Davey in time?

01:15:30.961 --> 01:15:34.487
What does that got to do with this house?
Or with leaving?

01:15:36.199 --> 01:15:39.997
Ben...
I can't believe you're serious!

01:15:40.436 --> 01:15:41.869
Oh, I'm serious, Marian.

01:15:44.807 --> 01:15:47.605
Do you know how ridiculous you're sounding?

01:15:49.445 --> 01:15:53.710
Are you actually trying to tell me
that this house is responsible?

01:15:57.252 --> 01:15:59.345
Would you give it up for me?

01:15:59.821 --> 01:16:03.416
I mean, even if you thought it
was in my head, in my mind?

01:16:05.026 --> 01:16:06.323
Would you?

01:16:10.197 --> 01:16:12.356
Dad!
Mom!

01:16:16.170 --> 01:16:17.398
Dad, it's Elizabeth!

01:16:19.573 --> 01:16:21.040
She's up here.

01:16:25.545 --> 01:16:26.705
Oh my God.

01:16:28.047 --> 01:16:31.547
Marian, get Davey out of here, please.
Get him out now, please!

01:16:41.793 --> 01:16:45.388
What's the number of that doctor
I used when Davey was ill?

01:16:46.798 --> 01:16:49.562
- Where is it?
- On the hall table.

01:16:50.535 --> 01:16:51.763
Stay with her.

01:17:34.543 --> 01:17:36.101
Did you get him?

01:17:37.143 --> 01:17:38.601
No.

01:17:39.581 --> 01:17:40.946
It was busy.

01:17:41.483 --> 01:17:43.644
Well it can't be busy all night.

01:17:44.353 --> 01:17:45.581
Can't they?

01:17:46.922 --> 01:17:51.916
They were all busy, Marian.
Every God damn one I tried.

01:17:54.295 --> 01:17:55.922
Including the operator.

01:17:57.465 --> 01:17:58.962
Surprised?

01:17:59.967 --> 01:18:02.629
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:18:03.104 --> 01:18:05.197
I'll go down and try him myself.

01:18:05.973 --> 01:18:07.337
Yes, you do that.

01:18:43.074 --> 01:18:45.008
- I got it.
- You got him?

01:18:46.044 --> 01:18:49.275
But all the lines were busy, Marian.
I didn't imagine that.

01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:51.209
No, I'm sure you didn't.

01:18:52.851 --> 01:18:55.411
The important thing is he'll be here.

01:19:03.927 --> 01:19:05.899
Isn't there something I can do?

01:19:06.591 --> 01:19:09.755
No, no.
You go and check on Davey, OK?

01:19:10.968 --> 01:19:13.459
And then wait for the doctor downstairs.

01:23:26.941 --> 01:23:29.307
Ashes to ashes,
and dust to dust.

01:23:30.344 --> 01:23:33.351
In the sure and certain
hope of the ressurection

01:23:33.364 --> 01:23:36.444
of eternal life through
Jesus Christ, our Lord...

01:23:37.785 --> 01:23:41.185
And in her courage and faith,
this good woman is now...

01:23:41.187 --> 01:23:43.478
joined in eternal peace
with her Maker ...

01:23:43.790 --> 01:23:45.724
in His Divine Kingdom...

01:23:46.126 --> 01:23:49.254
And we who grieve must take solace
in the fact...

01:23:49.662 --> 01:23:54.460
that we, too, are promised life eternal,
as our reward for our good work.

01:24:03.709 --> 01:24:05.836
I love eating by candlelight.

01:24:11.683 --> 01:24:14.487
Well, life sure as hell
goes on, doesn't it Marian.

01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:15.751
And why shouldn't it?

01:24:18.422 --> 01:24:22.014
- Aren't you sitting down, dear?
- To be perfectly frank, I...

01:24:22.827 --> 01:24:24.818
I do not have an appetite.

01:24:27.131 --> 01:24:30.464
Look, Elizabeth is dead.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

01:24:31.035 --> 01:24:33.128
It means a great deal to me.
Davey!

01:24:34.337 --> 01:24:36.952
Marian, I'm not sure that
anything means a great deal to

01:24:36.965 --> 01:24:39.499
you except this bloody house,
do you understand that?!

01:24:39.709 --> 01:24:41.540
Well, that isn't true.

01:24:43.914 --> 01:24:47.577
Then how do you account for your absence
at Elizabeth's funeral?

01:24:48.685 --> 01:24:51.710
You know I couldn't leave
Mrs. Allardyce alone.

01:24:57.626 --> 01:24:59.409
Oh, I don't think we
want that on the table,

01:24:59.422 --> 01:25:01.255
do we sweetheart? Not
on the pretty mahogany.

01:25:02.331 --> 01:25:04.925
Why don't you pour it, and bring
the bottle back to the kitchen.

01:25:05.034 --> 01:25:08.161
- But there aren't any glasses.
- Well, there's a goblet.

01:25:08.670 --> 01:25:11.161
Is better than glass.
It's silver.

01:25:11.606 --> 01:25:14.575
But I don't want a goblet, I want a glass.

01:25:14.676 --> 01:25:19.674
You heard what your mother said, Davey.
You are messing up her table.

01:25:21.816 --> 01:25:25.751
- Are you going to sit down?
- I have told you, Marian, I'm not hungry.

01:25:29.389 --> 01:25:31.755
Well now, thanks to you, neither am I.

01:25:54.814 --> 01:25:56.441
Call the old lady.

01:26:00.252 --> 01:26:01.879
I want to see her.

01:26:03.054 --> 01:26:05.022
Ben, stay away from that door!

01:26:06.258 --> 01:26:08.783
- Marian, open this door.
- I can't.

01:26:09.027 --> 01:26:12.554
She has the only key.
I don't have that key, it's locked.

01:26:13.465 --> 01:26:17.873
All right, what is it you know?
What is it you've known all along?

01:26:18.569 --> 01:26:19.968
Let me go.

01:26:21.905 --> 01:26:23.065
Please.

01:26:24.742 --> 01:26:27.040
We're getting out of this house.

01:26:31.749 --> 01:26:34.913
Did you hear what I said?
I said we are leaving this house!

01:26:35.685 --> 01:26:37.277
Well, how can we?

01:26:38.688 --> 01:26:39.712
How?

01:26:40.423 --> 01:26:42.914
We just pack up and go, that's how.

01:26:46.095 --> 01:26:47.914
Ben, will you just let
me lock this room up?

01:26:47.927 --> 01:26:50.030
Look Marian, will you stop
talking about this room!

01:26:50.132 --> 01:26:53.431
It's all you ever think of, the
room, the house, and the old lady.

01:26:53.535 --> 01:26:55.162
Well, she depends on me.

01:26:56.571 --> 01:26:58.368
I am the only one.

01:26:59.675 --> 01:27:04.112
There is no one, no one, to
take care of her except me.

01:27:06.647 --> 01:27:08.911
Now, you can't expect me to...

01:27:11.652 --> 01:27:13.586
You're obsessed with it.

01:27:14.722 --> 01:27:17.282
- All of it.
- I'm not obsessed with it!

01:27:18.693 --> 01:27:21.161
Marian, this house is destroying us.

01:27:22.596 --> 01:27:32.292
Darling, this house is everything
we've always wanted.

01:27:32.906 --> 01:27:35.297
And it's ours...

01:27:35.975 --> 01:27:38.691
For as long as...

01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:43.090
Marian...

01:27:44.650 --> 01:27:47.150
Whether you come with us or not...

01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:50.051
Tomorrow...

01:27:52.057 --> 01:27:53.149
...we're going back.

01:27:53.198 --> 01:27:55.325
Going back? To what?

01:27:56.195 --> 01:27:58.089
To what we had.

01:27:59.931 --> 01:28:01.421
We had nothing.

01:28:03.634 --> 01:28:06.034
And what do you suppose we've got now?

01:29:58.142 --> 01:30:00.133
- Davey, wake up.
- What?

01:30:00.244 --> 01:30:02.144
- Wake up, we're leaving.
- What?

01:30:02.279 --> 01:30:03.974
Somehow the house is...

01:30:04.248 --> 01:30:05.875
- ...it's changing.
- What?

01:30:06.550 --> 01:30:09.314
The boards... some of the
boards and tiles...

01:30:12.055 --> 01:30:14.046
...they are being replaced...

01:30:14.724 --> 01:30:16.076
...by new ones.

01:30:16.125 --> 01:30:18.286
Now, don't ask me why.
Just get out of here, all right?

01:30:18.394 --> 01:30:20.328
- But dad, wait a minute.
- Get out!

01:30:48.489 --> 01:30:49.979
Dad!

01:30:59.033 --> 01:31:01.228
- Stop it! Stop it!
- You get in there!

01:31:42.173 --> 01:31:43.604
Oh my God!

01:32:51.238 --> 01:32:52.671
Stop it, dad! Stop it!

01:33:09.422 --> 01:33:11.856
Slow down! Wait for mom!

01:33:19.665 --> 01:33:21.957
Stop it, please, stop it!

01:33:57.500 --> 01:34:01.633
I don't know...
He banged his head or something.

01:34:01.805 --> 01:34:04.706
He's fine, dear.
I'm going to take you back.

01:34:05.842 --> 01:34:10.367
You... are accepting this...

01:34:11.346 --> 01:34:13.405
...because you're part of it!

01:34:25.927 --> 01:34:27.690
Are you a part of this?

01:34:55.190 --> 01:34:58.589
Dad? Dad, what's wrong? Dad?

01:35:17.475 --> 01:35:19.636
Will he be all right, doctor?

01:35:27.051 --> 01:35:30.452
He's heavily sedated, which means
he'll sleep through the night.

01:35:30.555 --> 01:35:33.363
But by tomorrow morning I'm afraid
he's gonna require hospitalisation.

01:35:33.463 --> 01:35:34.831
I see.

01:35:34.892 --> 01:35:37.270
Of course, you understand,
we don't have the proper

01:35:37.283 --> 01:35:39.856
facilities here. You'll have
to take him into the city.

01:35:41.899 --> 01:35:44.231
But will he be all right, doctor?

01:35:44.334 --> 01:35:46.431
Well, I'm not a specialist
in these matters

01:35:46.444 --> 01:35:48.600
Mrs. Rolf, but with the
proper care he'll...

01:35:48.705 --> 01:35:50.695
I'm sure I can give it to him.

01:35:50.807 --> 01:35:53.401
If you need me tomorrow
I'll be at my office.

01:35:53.509 --> 01:35:56.205
- Thank you, doctor.
- I'll see myself out.

01:36:08.344 --> 01:36:09.611
Mom?

01:36:11.359 --> 01:36:13.024
Is dad OK?

01:36:13.461 --> 01:36:16.897
Yes, sweetheart. The doctor just said
he needs some more rest.

01:36:21.436 --> 01:36:23.699
- Feel all right?
- Yeah, I guess.

01:36:24.939 --> 01:36:26.873
Can we go home tomorrow?

01:36:29.210 --> 01:36:33.275
Oh, I don't think so sweetheart.
Daddy will be better off here.

01:36:34.481 --> 01:36:37.506
- Now, why don't you go to sleep?
- Good night.

01:37:08.447 --> 01:37:10.642
Davey, come on out while I fix lunch.

01:37:10.829 --> 01:37:13.127
Oh come on mom, I won't
go in the deep end.

01:37:13.352 --> 01:37:15.581
No, you've been in long enough.
Now, where's your robe?

01:37:16.454 --> 01:37:18.081
Oh, I think I left it in my room.

01:37:18.189 --> 01:37:21.022
Well, that's all right. Stay with your
father, and I'll bring it with me.

01:37:49.594 --> 01:37:52.528
Hey, dad?
Are you OK?

01:37:59.194 --> 01:38:01.128
Hey, you wanna see me swim?

01:38:01.864 --> 01:38:05.026
Look, I'm pretty good now,
I've been practising all day.

01:38:05.566 --> 01:38:08.000
You wanna see me go in the deep end?

01:38:08.102 --> 01:38:10.593
I can swim down there now, you know.

01:38:11.372 --> 01:38:12.703
Okay? Okay, watch.

01:38:12.807 --> 01:38:15.674
I've been practising for you.
Watch this!

01:38:51.711 --> 01:38:53.645
Davey!
Stay away from that end!

01:39:11.855 --> 01:39:14.050
Dad? Dad!

01:39:36.853 --> 01:39:38.247
Help me!

01:41:50.478 --> 01:41:53.976
Are you OK.. are you all right, honey?
OK, darling?

01:42:10.564 --> 01:42:12.558
I tried...

01:42:24.177 --> 01:42:26.610
Dad! He's talking.

01:42:34.654 --> 01:42:41.018
- I was afraid I'd have to watch.
- I couldn't...

01:42:43.361 --> 01:42:47.094
Yes, darling. Of course you couldn't.

01:42:48.099 --> 01:42:52.327
I hate this place.
I wanna get out of here. I hate it!

01:42:53.971 --> 01:42:55.531
Davey, we are.

01:42:57.908 --> 01:43:01.770
We are leaving this place.
Today.

01:43:16.993 --> 01:43:18.858
Hey, I thought you said we were gonna go.

01:43:18.962 --> 01:43:21.522
- We are, sweetheart. Right now.
- OK.

01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:33.205
Are you OK?
You're sure?

01:43:52.426 --> 01:43:55.657
I forgot to tell Mrs. Allardyce
that we're leaving.

01:43:58.168 --> 01:44:02.127
Marian... please.

01:44:03.336 --> 01:44:05.803
I don't want you to go
back into that house.

01:44:07.340 --> 01:44:08.807
Ben, don't be silly.

01:44:09.375 --> 01:44:12.284
We can't just drive off and leave
that poor old lady sitting

01:44:12.297 --> 01:44:14.833
up there without even telling
her we're driving off.

01:44:18.183 --> 01:44:20.561
Come on mom, let's just
get out of here, OK?

01:44:20.574 --> 01:44:22.708
Please, I don't want
you to go back in.

01:44:22.921 --> 01:44:25.731
Hey come on fellas, I'll
just leave her our number

01:44:25.791 --> 01:44:29.249
so she knows where to reach us in case
she needs us, OK?

01:44:29.361 --> 01:44:31.290
It will just take a moment.

01:46:01.314 --> 01:46:03.407
Mrs Allardyce?
It's me.

01:46:04.951 --> 01:46:06.716
It's Marian.

01:47:28.529 --> 01:47:30.690
I got to go and get your mother.

01:50:02.841 --> 01:50:04.802
Marian, are you in there?

01:50:24.061 --> 01:50:25.592
Mrs. Allardyce?

01:50:52.521 --> 01:50:55.554
I'm sorry, I didn't wish to disturb you,
but I was looking for Marian

01:50:55.657 --> 01:51:00.456
She said she was going to come up here
and tell you that we were leaving.

01:51:04.408 --> 01:51:05.931
Mrs. Allardyce.

01:51:09.337 --> 01:51:12.007
Look, I do know that she came up here.

01:51:14.475 --> 01:51:18.103
You must have spoken to her.
Would you tell me where she is, please?

01:51:22.015 --> 01:51:25.480
Mrs. Allardyce, I am talking to you.
Will you answer me, please.

01:51:27.487 --> 01:51:29.482
Will you answer me.

01:51:31.007 --> 01:51:32.782
Will you answer me!

01:51:42.106 --> 01:51:43.305
Marian?

01:51:46.172 --> 01:51:48.163
I've been waiting for you, Ben.

01:51:58.616 --> 01:51:59.683
Oh God!

01:52:34.104 --> 01:52:35.255
Mom!

01:53:21.461 --> 01:53:23.452
Oh, it's beautiful!

01:53:24.631 --> 01:53:28.492
Just glorious...
like it used to be.

01:53:30.637 --> 01:53:31.999
And our mother...

01:53:33.006 --> 01:53:34.636
She's back.

01:53:34.807 --> 01:53:36.836
Our darling.

01:53:37.743 --> 01:53:39.233
Restored to us...

01:53:40.145 --> 01:53:42.506
...in all her beauty.

01:53:42.948 --> 01:53:44.945
Her glory!

01:53:45.017 --> 01:53:48.376
With us... once again.
