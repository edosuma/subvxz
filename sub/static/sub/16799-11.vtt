00:01.530 --> 00:04.624
Previously on Elementary...
Shinwell's still
engaged with SBK.

00:04.670 --> 00:06.763
Right, but he still wants
to bring SBK down.

00:06.800 --> 00:08.768
HOLMES:
As an undercover operative,
I find him wanting.

00:08.800 --> 00:11.166
He lacks the guile
to play multiple sides.

00:11.210 --> 00:13.678
Not to mention the rudimentary
skills of survival.

00:13.710 --> 00:15.075
Quit while you're
still alive.

00:15.110 --> 00:16.771
What I do is_ none
of your busmess.

00:16.810 --> 00:18.801
I infiltrated a police
lab on your behalf.

00:18.850 --> 00:20.477
I wiped your fingerprints
off a weapon.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.317
I think that gives me
plenty of skin in the game.

00:22.350 --> 00:24.045
I have a proposal.

00:24.090 --> 00:26.581
I offered that we train you
to be an informant.

00:26.620 --> 00:27.814
We can teach you
the skills you require

00:27.860 --> 00:29.782
to survive
that undertaking.

00:29.830 --> 00:32.355
Do you accept the proposal?

00:34.130 --> 00:37.668
(Engelbert Humperdinck's
"Quando Quando Quando" playing)

00:37.700 --> 00:40.362
* Tell me when will you
be mine? *

00:42.770 --> 00:48.174
* Tell me
quando quando quando *

00:48.210 --> 00:51.771
* We can share
a love dIVIne... *

00:53.720 --> 00:55.847
Oh, come on, darling,
you can't sulk all day.

00:55.880 --> 00:57.211
* Again

00:58.590 --> 01:01.286
Mmm...

01:01.320 --> 01:02.480
Here you go.

01:02.530 --> 01:05.624
Actually, uh,
I'm out of here.

01:05.660 --> 01:07.252
Ah, wish me luck.

01:07.300 --> 01:08.790
* Quando quando quando

01:08.830 --> 01:10.092
Good luck, Ryan.

01:10.130 --> 01:11.597
Ah, all right.

01:11.630 --> 01:15.191
* You mean happiness to me

01:15.240 --> 01:17.663
Ooh! Can you
believe it?

01:17.710 --> 01:20.372
I almost forgot.

01:22.410 --> 01:25.709
* Every moment's a day

01:27.520 --> 01:29.181
* Every day
All right.

01:29.220 --> 01:32.678
* Seems a lifetime

01:32.720 --> 01:36.759
* Let me show you the way

01:38.530 --> 01:42.762
* To a joy beyond compare
(door shuts, locks)

01:42.800 --> 01:45.360
This is outrageous.

01:45.400 --> 01:46.537
It's absurd.

01:46.570 --> 01:48.333
Couldn't agree more.

01:48.370 --> 01:50.804
Caving a security guards
skull in for a baseball card

01:50.840 --> 01:52.171
is grotesque, if you ask me.

01:52.210 --> 01:53.677
Listen to me.

01:53.710 --> 01:55.871
I didn't have anything
to do with this.

01:55.910 --> 01:57.309
Please, Mr. Charles, if you keep
swearing you're innocent,

01:57.350 --> 01:58.874
it's only gonna
be worse for you

01:58.910 --> 02:01.515
when we find the stolen
merchandise In your car,

02:01.550 --> 02:03.381
in your house or wherever.

02:03.420 --> 02:05.741
So why don't you just
tell us where it is?

02:05.790 --> 02:07.655
Save us the trouble.

02:07.690 --> 02:09.829
I've worked at Fenneman's
Fine Auctions since 1988.

02:09.860 --> 02:11.327
I started as a clerk.

02:11.360 --> 02:14.249
I worked my way up
to senior vice president.

02:14.300 --> 02:16.222
Why would I risk
all that now?

02:16.270 --> 02:17.328
Money, you idiot.

02:18.330 --> 02:19.797
Eddie Plank's 1909 card

02:19.840 --> 02:21.762
was expected to
fetch $300,000

02:21.800 --> 02:22.732
at auction last week.

02:22.770 --> 02:24.761
You took it from the
staging area downstairs

02:24.810 --> 02:26.630
because you could.

02:26.680 --> 02:27.874
And you put a security
guard in a coma

02:27.910 --> 02:29.343
because your plan
was sloppy.

02:29.380 --> 02:31.769
Here's the bad news.
Mr. Holmes here

02:31.810 --> 02:33.641
recognized the ash
from your pipe

02:33.680 --> 02:36.740
on the man's lapel.

02:36.790 --> 02:38.815
You stood over your victim a
little too long, didn't you?

02:38.850 --> 02:40.681
Perhaps you
regretted bashing his

02:40.720 --> 02:43.928
parietal bone in with
Robert E. Lee's field glasses.

02:43.960 --> 02:45.450
Perhaps you paused
to wipe off

02:45.490 --> 02:46.957
your hastily chosen weapon
before returning it

02:47.000 --> 02:48.922
to its display case.

02:48.960 --> 02:51.622
One of these is for you.

02:51.670 --> 02:54.298
But before we get to it,
I thought you might want to name

02:54.340 --> 02:55.796
your accomplice.

02:55.840 --> 02:58.468
The DA looks favorably
on that sort of thing.

02:58.510 --> 03:01.331
You found ash,
that's all.

03:01.380 --> 03:03.575
Could've been left by anybody.

03:03.610 --> 03:04.747
Well, not "anybody."

03:04.780 --> 03:05.906
Somebody who smokes

03:05.950 --> 03:09.442
Majordomo's
Royal Tan Blend.

03:09.490 --> 03:11.913
That's what you've got there
in your pipe, isn't it?

03:14.020 --> 03:15.885
You've got to go over there
and take care of her.

03:17.730 --> 03:18.981
No, I don't know if the police

03:19.030 --> 03:21.419
are here for me or not,
but I can't do it myself.

03:23.570 --> 03:24.923
The first thing
you need to know--

03:24.970 --> 03:27.461
Excuse me, I'll
be right back.

03:31.440 --> 03:33.874
(women laughing)

03:33.910 --> 03:35.468
WOMAN:
I don't think she knows.

03:35.510 --> 03:36.943
Like, maybe her nose
doesn't work.

03:36.980 --> 03:38.948
WOMAN 2: Somebody
ought to tell her.

03:38.980 --> 03:41.915
WOMAN: Right? Linda, honey,
your perfume smells like stew.

03:41.950 --> 03:44.339
(women laughing, clamoring)

03:54.830 --> 03:58.368
DECKER: Come on, darling,
give me a twirl.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.898
You took my phone.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.409
Where is she?

04:08.440 --> 04:09.543
Where are you
keeping her?

04:09.580 --> 04:11.639
Hey! Hey!

04:11.680 --> 04:13.011
What the hell's
going on here?

04:13.050 --> 04:14.847
He took my phone,
and he had no right!

04:14.880 --> 04:16.017
My mistake.

04:16.050 --> 04:17.642
I-I-I thought you were
someone else.

04:17.690 --> 04:20.011
Right, yeah, whatever.

04:21.520 --> 04:23.021
You want to tell me
what Just happened?

04:23.060 --> 04:24.550
It was my mistake.

What do you call this?

05:05.070 --> 05:08.096
I call it failing a test.

All right, time's up.

05:12.610 --> 05:15.477
What's going on

05:15.510 --> 05:16.704
What do you mean?

05:16.750 --> 05:17.944
I mean two weeks ago,

05:17.980 --> 05:20.574
you asked us to train you so you
could take down your old gang.

05:20.620 --> 05:22.588
You said you'd do
whatever it takes.

05:22.620 --> 05:23.587
Yeah, well, I didn't expect
you'd have me reading up

05:23.620 --> 05:24.780
on micro-expressions,

05:24.820 --> 05:27.050
and conjugating verbs
in Spanish.

05:27.090 --> 05:28.512
You're gonna want
to know who's lying,

05:28.560 --> 05:30.380
and you might need
to listen in on a conversation

05:30.430 --> 05:33.888
between SBK leaders
and their Dominican suppliers.

05:33.930 --> 05:36.467
What if you have to get
behind a locked door?

05:36.500 --> 05:37.865
If you take this long
to break in,

05:37.900 --> 05:39.492
the person who's going
to be standing behind you

05:39.540 --> 05:40.962
is not gonna be
holding a stopwatch.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.434
I've just been busy lately.

05:43.470 --> 05:45.028
Studying kind of fell
by the wayside.

05:45.070 --> 05:46.799
I'll do better.
(door slams)

05:46.840 --> 05:49.707
HOLMES:
Watson, downstairs!

05:53.520 --> 05:54.612
Get your coat.

05:54.650 --> 05:55.912
We're leaving.
What's going on?

05:55.950 --> 05:58.441
I thought you were finishing
that baseball card thing

05:58.490 --> 05:59.980
at Fenneman's this morning.
As that case concluded,

06:00.020 --> 06:01.681
another one presented itself.

06:01.720 --> 06:04.427
I saw a nervous
auction house employee

06:04.460 --> 06:05.552
who seemed unduly troubled
that the police were

06:05.590 --> 06:06.818
visiting his office.

06:06.860 --> 06:08.122
He has good reason
to be anxious,

06:08.160 --> 06:09.661
'cause he's holding
a woman prisoner.

06:09.700 --> 06:11.167
How do you know?

06:11.200 --> 06:12.633
I read his lips,
so I picked his pocket,

06:12.670 --> 06:14.490
and I broke into his phone.

06:14.540 --> 06:16.861
Suspect's name is Ryan Decker.
He lives in Woodhaven.

06:16.910 --> 06:19.037
I stopped off on my way
to get some equipment

06:19.070 --> 06:20.799
and some backup.

06:20.840 --> 06:22.501
Hey, you're bleeding.

06:22.550 --> 06:23.574
I didn't see
him coming

06:23.610 --> 06:25.009
when he _came
to retrieve hIs phone.

06:25.050 --> 06:26.915
What I did see was his victim.

06:26.950 --> 06:28.577
She was shackled
in the video,

06:28.620 --> 06:29.917
taken three days ago.

06:29.950 --> 06:32.180
She's Asian.
She's mid-to-late 205.

06:32.220 --> 06:33.983
When Decker mistakenly thought
the police had come for him,

06:34.020 --> 06:36.853
he called an accomplice and told
him to "take care of her."

06:36.890 --> 06:38.721
What did the captain say?
Nothing.
I didn't tell him.

06:38.760 --> 06:40.523
Why the hell not?
Because the police
would lack

06:40.560 --> 06:41.697
probable cause
for a warrant,

06:41.730 --> 06:43.664
as I did when I broke
into his phone.

06:43.700 --> 06:45.065
Police come hard
after people

06:45.100 --> 06:46.567
without PC all the time.

06:46.600 --> 06:47.589
This is not
stop and frisk.

06:47.640 --> 06:49.733
This is a
psychosexual madman

06:49.770 --> 06:50.998
holding a kidnapped woman

06:51.040 --> 06:53.770
in an as yet
unidentified location.

06:53.810 --> 06:54.936
I tried the last number
that Decker called.

06:54.980 --> 06:56.868
It was to a burner.

06:56.910 --> 06:59.777
He called his accomplice
to warn him after our encounter.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.947
Wait, so you and I are gonna
raid his house on our own?

07:01.980 --> 07:03.914
I don't see another move
on the board.

07:03.950 --> 07:05.508
The police's hands
would be tied.

07:05.550 --> 07:06.653
Lock up for us, would you?

07:12.730 --> 07:14.698
Vacant house for sale
to the north of him,

07:14.730 --> 07:16.129
a couple of hippies
on the other side

07:16.160 --> 07:18.162
with matching "Co-Exist"
bumper stickers.

07:18.200 --> 07:19.929
I doubt they'd be as tolerant
of their neighbor's lifestyle

07:19.970 --> 07:21.460
if they got a look at it.

07:21.500 --> 07:22.808
Seems he keeps
the shades drawn.

07:22.840 --> 07:24.137
Makes it hard to know
if his accomplice

07:24.170 --> 07:25.637
is in there
with a shotgun.

07:25.670 --> 07:27.570
This woman might be killed
because I crossed paths

07:27.610 --> 07:29.100
with her captor--
I have to go in.

07:29.140 --> 07:32.109
We could call and report
a suspicious behavior.

07:32.150 --> 07:33.549
Have ESU crash in.

07:33.580 --> 07:35.138
We could, but if
he's got her elsewhere,

07:35.180 --> 07:37.717
we'll miss our best opportunity
to inspect his home.

07:58.770 --> 08:01.102
She's not here.
No one IS.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.038
WATSON: There's gotta be
a week's worth of mail

08:05.080 --> 08:07.878

08:07.920 --> 08:09.740
(flies buzzing)

08:09.790 --> 08:13.783
You said that video you saw
was three days old?

08:13.820 --> 08:17.620
Doesn't smell like anyone's
been here in that time.

08:17.660 --> 08:18.820
Well, maybe we can find
something here that'll tell us

08:18.860 --> 08:20.828
where he's been
spending his time.

08:23.570 --> 08:25.788
Well, if there was anything
that could point

08:25.830 --> 08:27.536
to where he was holding her,
I thought it'd be this.

08:27.570 --> 08:28.798
Credit card statement?

08:28.840 --> 08:31.058
Yeah. Doesn't tell us
much, though.

08:31.110 --> 08:32.805
The guy's thrifty.

08:32.840 --> 08:35.934
Bunch of small charges at fast
food joints near his office.

08:35.980 --> 08:37.709
Bought some
cheap frames.

08:37.750 --> 08:40.310
If the people at Fenneman's
saw his taste in art,

08:40.350 --> 08:41.749
I bet he'd be fired.

08:41.780 --> 08:43.316
His poor taste extends
to films as well.

08:43.350 --> 08:44.817
Are any of those homemade?

08:44.850 --> 08:45.817
No, nothing so useful.

08:45.850 --> 08:47.659
But...

08:47.690 --> 08:49.681
I found a copy of Mannequin.

08:51.230 --> 08:54.119
Mannequin tells the story
of a lonely New Yorker

08:54.160 --> 08:55.320
who can't tell
the difference

08:55.360 --> 08:57.828
between a woman and an object.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.633
He dresses her up,
they elude

08:59.670 --> 09:02.298
the bumbling authorities,
they fall in love.

09:02.340 --> 09:04.035
I can't imagine why
you would discard it.

09:04.070 --> 09:05.765
I would have thought
it would be your favorite film.

09:05.810 --> 09:08.028
I don't know about
my favorite, but...

09:08.080 --> 09:09.945
It ain't exactly
The Godfather trilogy,

09:09.980 --> 09:13.177
but that DVD definitely
was not in my trash.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.211
You broke into my house
and put it there.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.911
That's a claim you can't prove.

09:16.950 --> 09:18.588
The NYPD, on the other hand,

09:18.620 --> 09:20.212
absolutely can prove
that your fingerprints

09:20.260 --> 09:23.024
are on it, along with
30 other pirated DVDs

09:23.060 --> 09:25.949
found in the garbage can
at your curb.

09:25.990 --> 09:27.628
Why don't we just
cut to the chase?

09:27.660 --> 09:29.127
You know, do I,
do I owe a fine or something?

09:29.160 --> 09:31.094
HOLMES: It's not that
simple, I'm afraid.

09:31.130 --> 09:33.132
New York is cracking down
on copyright infringement.

09:33.170 --> 09:34.068
At the FBI,

09:34.100 --> 09:35.761
of course,
it never goes out of fashion.

09:35.800 --> 09:37.108
I reached out to a friend there

09:37.140 --> 09:39.233
about doubling up
your prosecution.

09:39.270 --> 09:42.307
You're going to be made
an example of, Mr. Decker.

09:42.340 --> 09:44.308
That's harassment.

09:44.350 --> 09:45.772
You see that, right?

09:45.810 --> 09:47.812
This guy tries
to steal my phone,

09:47.850 --> 09:49.374
then he roughs me up.

09:49.420 --> 09:51.081
Now he's poking around
in my trash

09:51.120 --> 09:52.678
for no good reason.

09:52.720 --> 09:53.914
He's got good reason.

09:54.860 --> 09:56.953
He thinks you're keeping
a woman captive.

09:56.990 --> 09:59.220
I feel like I'm in a bad dream.

09:59.260 --> 10:00.227
Nonsense, you've done
an excellent job

10:00.260 --> 10:01.693
of keeping your wits about you.

10:01.730 --> 10:02.799
Ditching your phone,
for instance.

10:04.700 --> 10:05.826
After you turned it off,
I guess.

10:05.870 --> 10:07.167
We can't get a signal.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.839
Where is she, Mr. Decker?

10:09.870 --> 10:11.838
I'd like to talk
to my lawyer now.

10:11.870 --> 10:13.929
Who did you send to
take care of your captive?

10:13.980 --> 10:15.004
You keep asking me questions,

10:15.040 --> 10:17.008
I'm gonna tack that
onto the lawsuit I'm filing

10:17.050 --> 10:18.870
against the police department.

10:18.910 --> 10:21.140
Your attorney is on his way,
Mr. Decker.

10:21.180 --> 10:23.341
But he's gonna have
his hands full.

10:23.390 --> 10:26.245
You're gonna be processed
and arraigned as slow

10:26.290 --> 10:28.713
as the law allows.

10:28.760 --> 10:30.955
And we're gonna have more time
to find this woman.

10:30.990 --> 10:32.821
You better hope she's alive
when we do.

10:38.200 --> 10:40.259
Went that well, huh?

10:40.300 --> 10:41.858
He's not gonna talk.
He's extroverted,

10:41.900 --> 10:43.959
but he's not impulsive,
he knows when to shut up.

10:44.010 --> 10:45.807
Seems like a theme;
he deleted most of his

10:45.840 --> 10:47.705
social media this morning--
makes me wonder

10:47.740 --> 10:48.968
if that's how he was talking
to his accomplice

10:50.050 --> 10:51.278
you guys better
find him quick.

10:51.310 --> 10:52.868
I know we were
laying it on thick

10:52.920 --> 10:54.273
in there, but
just to be clear,

10:54.320 --> 10:55.344
there's no way
I can hold him

10:55.380 --> 10:57.439
for more than a day or two
on nonviolent charges.

10:57.490 --> 10:58.843
You pulled
the missing persons files?

10:58.890 --> 11:00.050
Yeah, I went through
the active files,

11:00.090 --> 11:01.955
looking for women
of Asian descent.

11:01.990 --> 11:04.026
Any of those
look familiar?

11:05.160 --> 11:06.821
No.

11:06.860 --> 11:08.350
GREGSON: She probably
hasn't been reported yet.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.425
We should focus on his
end of the equation,

11:10.470 --> 11:11.425
go talk to his
friends and family.

11:11.470 --> 11:12.937
Marcus just left,

11:12.970 --> 11:13.959
he went to speak
to Decker's parents

11:14.000 --> 11:15.194
in Pequannock,
New Jersey.

11:15.240 --> 11:16.093
As for his friends,

11:16.140 --> 11:17.903
there's a bunch of photos
of Decker online

11:17.940 --> 11:20.238
at a bar called Little Bean--
It's In Queens.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.236
That's a long drive from
Woodhaven, hardly his local.

11:22.280 --> 11:23.747
Perhaps it's closer
to where he's holding her.

11:23.780 --> 11:25.099
I thought maybe you could
talk to his friends

11:25.150 --> 11:26.947
while I go see his ex-wife,
Carrie Traub.

11:26.980 --> 11:27.969
He's got an ex?

11:28.020 --> 11:29.373
That's nice to hear.

11:29.420 --> 11:30.910
Means at least one woman
was lucky enough

11:30.950 --> 11:31.939
to get away
from this guy.

11:36.020 --> 11:38.921
I wish I could help you.

11:38.960 --> 11:42.418
I haven't spoken to Ryan since
we signed the divorce papers.

11:42.460 --> 11:44.997
I can't stand him.

11:45.030 --> 11:46.224
You don't seem
that surprised.

11:46.270 --> 11:47.396
Well, I don't know, I--

11:47.440 --> 11:48.759
I wouldn't go that far,

11:48.800 --> 11:50.267
but what you're saying,
I mean,

11:50.310 --> 11:52.403
it's worse than anything
I would have predicted.

11:52.440 --> 11:55.932
(sighs) Ryan always
had a cruel streak.

11:55.980 --> 11:57.948
Towards the end
of our marrIage,

11:57.980 --> 12:01.472
he got addicted to this
really disturbing pornography,

12:01.520 --> 12:03.738
and that's when I knew
I had to get out of there.

12:03.790 --> 12:05.781
So, he would go
online and...

12:05.820 --> 12:06.912
Just look.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.086
I mean, I-- at least,

12:08.120 --> 12:09.929
I think that's
all it was then.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.928
I really thought that interest
would stay in his head.

12:11.960 --> 12:15.327
I cannot believe he's got
some poor woman locked up.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.328
Do you have any
idea who Decker

12:17.370 --> 12:18.120
might be working with?

12:18.170 --> 12:20.195
A relative, a
friend he trusts?

12:20.240 --> 12:23.164
There wasn't anyone like that in
his life when we were together.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.166
See, Ryan always
made friends easily,

12:25.210 --> 12:27.269
he just never could
keep them.

12:27.310 --> 12:29.505
He seems a little off _
when you really get to know hIm.

12:29.540 --> 12:30.939
I can tell you,
no one around here

12:30.980 --> 12:32.208
complained when
we broke up.

12:32.250 --> 12:36.038
They were just as happy
to be rid of him as I was.

12:36.080 --> 12:37.513
So, Ryan worked here?

12:37.550 --> 12:40.189
He quit when we broke up,
which was kind of a shame,

12:40.220 --> 12:41.915
'cause I really wanted
to fire him.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.882
I'm surprised he
didn't try to stay.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.056
What do you mean?

12:45.090 --> 12:46.227
I mean, this
is a good place

12:46.260 --> 12:47.454
to shop for victims.

12:47.500 --> 12:48.558
A lot of your
immigration cases

12:48.600 --> 12:49.897
deal with at-risk women.

12:49.930 --> 12:51.898
No, Ryan never did
any field work.

12:51.930 --> 12:54.296
He was, um, just
a systems manager.

12:54.340 --> 12:55.898
Was he any good?

12:55.940 --> 12:58.829
(sighs) I hate to say
a kind word about the guy,

12:58.870 --> 13:00.076
but yeah. Why?

13:00.110 --> 13:01.930
I was just wondering

13:01.980 --> 13:05.143
if there was any chance he still
had access to your database.

13:05.180 --> 13:07.148
He helped build
our database.

13:07.180 --> 13:10.047
I, I guess it's possible
he might have left himself

13:10.090 --> 13:12.046
a back door or something,
but I-I doubt it.

13:12.090 --> 13:13.216
Would it be okay

13:13.260 --> 13:15.854
ifI had an expert come and
take a look at your code?

13:15.890 --> 13:17.118
Just to be sure?
Sure.

13:17.160 --> 13:19.151
I'll get I.T. in here
to set it up.

13:19.190 --> 13:22.091
Hey. Bike messenger
just delivered this.

13:23.970 --> 13:26.188
Said it was urgent.

13:29.340 --> 13:30.136
Eh...

13:30.170 --> 13:32.161
There was a mistake
at the factory

13:32.210 --> 13:33.336
in Nanjing in the '905.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.007
A number of Midnight Rangers
were armed

13:35.040 --> 13:36.029
with magic wands,

13:36.080 --> 13:37.240
meant for the Princess Priscilla

13:37.280 --> 13:38.838
ﬁgunne.

13:38.880 --> 13:40.040
Got this one for a song.

13:40.080 --> 13:42.048
There are a couple more
zeros here

13:42.080 --> 13:43.183
than I would have expected.

13:43.220 --> 13:44.187
It's the cost of
domg busmess

13:44.220 --> 13:46.188
with an underage hacking savant.

13:46.220 --> 13:48.017
Mason required this as payment

13:48.060 --> 13:50.358
for reviewing
the ICE database architecture.

13:50.390 --> 13:52.893
I'm just glad he didn't want
a Princess with a battle-ax,

13:52.930 --> 13:54.124
'cause if you think
that's exorbitant...

13:54.160 --> 13:56.094
So what did Mason say?

13:56.130 --> 13:57.563
That the Immigration
and Customs Enforcement

13:57.600 --> 14:00.137
has the most airtight
government database

14:00.170 --> 14:02.195
he's ever encountered.

14:02.240 --> 14:03.559
Decker does not have
a back door there.

14:03.610 --> 14:04.929
Great. So you just bought

14:04.970 --> 14:06.130
the world's most expensive doll

14:06.170 --> 14:07.398
for no reason.
Yep.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.101
But you were right to consider
the possibility.

14:09.140 --> 14:10.505
The database is a_
verItable cornucopIa

14:10.550 --> 14:12.871
of potential victims.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.114
There's no group of women

14:14.150 --> 14:15.515
more vulnerable
to traffIckIng

14:15.550 --> 14:17.040
than recent immigrants.

14:17.090 --> 14:18.409
They've got no roots,

14:18.450 --> 14:19.951
they have
very few close friends.

14:19.990 --> 14:22.185
Kind of sounds
like Decker himself.

14:22.220 --> 14:24.654
You know, no one we've spoken to
has any insight into this guy.

14:24.690 --> 14:26.089
Hmm, yet he's outgoing,

14:26.130 --> 14:29.054
he's even likeable
on first blush.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.988
I bet he divulged
something to someone.

14:31.030 --> 14:32.327
(sighs)

14:32.370 --> 14:35.032
I'm gonna go make some coffee.

14:35.070 --> 14:36.867
Everything on an even keel
with Shinwell?

14:37.710 --> 14:39.337
I don't know.

14:39.370 --> 14:41.031
I mean, he says he's fine,

14:41.080 --> 14:42.479
but his training's
been kind of a slog.

14:42.510 --> 14:45.172
You're questioning
his level of commitment?

14:46.550 --> 14:50.441
Uh, I'd go all the way
to disappointed.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.913
When was the last time
you suppose he had a mentor

14:52.960 --> 14:54.313
or a teacher
who held him to account?

14:54.360 --> 14:57.227
No, I'm not sure he ever did.

14:57.260 --> 15:01.094
I mean, he might warm
to the experience.

15:01.130 --> 15:03.166
(clicks forcefully)

15:03.200 --> 15:04.462
What?

15:04.500 --> 15:07.537
Preeda Boonark.

15:07.570 --> 15:10.004
That's the woman I saw
on Decker's phone.

15:10.040 --> 15:12.065
Well, this is huge.

15:12.110 --> 15:14.271
We can dig into her life, figure
out where she disappeared.

15:14.310 --> 15:16.278
Gonna be a deep dive.

15:16.310 --> 15:18.107
There's good reason
Ms. Boonark didn't show up

15:18.150 --> 15:19.640
on the NYPD's ac_tive
mIssmg persons fIles.

15:19.680 --> 15:21.443
She hasn't been seen

15:21.480 --> 15:22.981
since she walked
off the cruise ship

15:23.020 --> 15:25.238
she was working on in 2011.

15:25.290 --> 15:28.350
She might have been
Decker's captive for five years.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.192
WOMAN:
I knew something bad happened.

15:35.230 --> 15:37.266
I told everyone I could,

15:37.300 --> 15:39.097
but they wouldn't believe me.

15:39.130 --> 15:41.963
This person
who took my friend,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.434
do you think
he'll try to...

15:44.470 --> 15:46.335
to get rid of her?

15:46.370 --> 15:48.372
Well, we don't know, but
we'll do everything we can

15:48.410 --> 15:50.378
to find her before
something bad happens.

15:50.410 --> 15:52.970
You're five years too late.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.715
I came then.

15:54.750 --> 15:57.389
Not to this station,
but to the police.

15:57.420 --> 15:59.547
They listened, they nodded,

15:59.590 --> 16:01.558
and then passed me off.

16:03.030 --> 16:04.679
Immigration
and Customs Enforcement

16:04.730 --> 16:06.686
handled the investigation.
They've got notes here--

16:06.730 --> 16:09.028
it looks like you went
to see them a dozen times.

16:09.060 --> 16:11.290
I felt responsible.
Why?

16:12.330 --> 16:14.662
Preeda was practically family.

16:14.700 --> 16:16.565
_We were friends
smce we were gIrls.

16:16.600 --> 16:20.138
I'm the one who convinced her to
go work for ImperIal AtlantIc.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.000
We _were_maids
on theIr crUIse shIps.

16:22.040 --> 16:24.747
We both wanted to establish
residency, to live in New York.

16:24.780 --> 16:26.771
The ICE agents who handled
the case, they seemed to think

16:26.810 --> 16:28.368
that she immigrated

16:28.420 --> 16:29.773
illegally, as soon as

16:29.820 --> 16:31.014
the ship made port.

16:31.050 --> 16:31.880
Preeda would never do that.

16:31.920 --> 16:33.683
BELL: Are you sure?
Because it matters.

16:33.720 --> 16:35.415
It will help us figure out
where her trail went,

16:36.420 --> 16:38.581
When we would put the mints
on the pillows,

16:38.630 --> 16:40.097
Preeda would never
take one.

16:40.130 --> 16:42.792
There is no way she would
move here without papers.

16:42.830 --> 16:45.719
Whoever took her,
took her then.

16:45.770 --> 16:47.089
Five years ago,

16:47.140 --> 16:48.664
when she went sightseeing
on her day off.

16:48.700 --> 16:52.238
Do you recognize
this man?

16:52.270 --> 16:54.773
No. I've never seen him.

16:56.480 --> 16:57.708
He's the one who has Preeda?

16:57.750 --> 16:58.808
He's a suspect, but we believe

16:58.850 --> 17:00.818
he's working with an accomplice.

17:00.850 --> 17:03.045
Can you think of anyone else
who might have been involved?

17:03.090 --> 17:03.818
Darnell Langston.

17:03.850 --> 17:04.782
Who's that?

17:04.820 --> 17:06.515
It's not in the file?

17:07.560 --> 17:09.312
I kept telling them.

17:09.360 --> 17:12.249
Darnell Langston worked
for the cruise company.

17:12.290 --> 17:15.691
He was a mechanic and he always
lurked around the women.

17:15.730 --> 17:18.494
He told me once, he could
get me a job here in the States.

17:18.530 --> 17:19.428
Where?

17:19.470 --> 17:22.439
A massage parlor.

17:22.470 --> 17:25.064
And you think he made Preeda
the same offer?

17:25.110 --> 17:26.099
I know he did.

17:26.140 --> 17:28.802
Preeda was sweet.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.400
A little naive.

17:31.450 --> 17:35.079
I told her it sounded like
it would really be prostitution.

17:35.120 --> 17:37.441
After she went missing,
Ithought

17:37.490 --> 17:39.811
maybe she didn't believe me.

17:39.850 --> 17:42.080
Maybe she went with him
to learn more.

17:45.790 --> 17:47.553
Well?

17:47.600 --> 17:50.364
Ms. Vee's instincts
are lookIng pretty good to me.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.766
Darnell Langston's
got quite a sheet.

17:52.800 --> 17:54.597
Auburn Correctional,
Great Meadow, Otisville--

17:54.640 --> 17:56.528
he's a graduate of some of
New York's finest institutions.

17:56.570 --> 17:58.606
These are both for me,
I didn't sleep last night.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.738
Aanay, looks like Darnell
was trained

18:01.780 --> 18:03.202
as a mechanic

18:03.250 --> 18:04.774
during his last prison stint.
He got hired

18:04.810 --> 18:07.119
by a few cruise lines,
never lasted long.

18:07.150 --> 18:08.811
One fired him over lewd conduct.

18:08.850 --> 18:10.841
Another dumped him
after a female crew member said

18:10.890 --> 18:13.154
he solicited bribes
and sexual favors

18:13.190 --> 18:14.782
in exchange
for fake immigration papers.

18:14.820 --> 18:16.412
So he was in the habit
of exploiting immigrants.

18:17.490 --> 18:19.378
Last year, it caught up to him.

18:19.430 --> 18:22.149
The DA. charged him,
but he skipped out on his bail.

18:22.200 --> 18:23.019
That makes him a fugitive.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.823
And a likely candidate
to have entered

18:24.870 --> 18:26.724
into an unholy alliance
with Ryan Decker.

18:26.770 --> 18:28.169
I think it's time to

18:28.200 --> 18:30.339
help the State of New York
find this guy.

18:30.370 --> 18:32.406
I'll call Watson, she'll
want to join the hunt,

18:32.440 --> 18:34.579
as soon as she's finished
talking to the ICE agents

18:34.610 --> 18:35.804
who botched
Ms. Boonark's

18:35.840 --> 18:37.307
case.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.807
(knocking at door)

18:39.850 --> 18:41.477
Shinwell, if that's you,

18:41.520 --> 18:43.818
just pick the lock
and let yourself in.

18:43.850 --> 18:45.147
(doorknob rattling)
SHINWELL: Come on, Doc.

18:45.190 --> 18:46.839
You know I can't.

18:57.430 --> 18:59.193
What's this?

18:59.230 --> 19:01.198
Darnell Langston's
extended family in Jersey City.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.265
One of them

19:03.310 --> 19:04.766
is almost definitely
hiding him.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.402
I'm confused.
Two hours ago,

19:06.440 --> 19:07.907
I asked if you knew
him at Great Meadow,

19:07.940 --> 19:09.339
you said you never
heard of him.

19:09.380 --> 19:10.677
What can I say?
Great Meadow was a big prison,

19:10.710 --> 19:12.177
New York's a small town.

19:12.210 --> 19:15.611
Uh, I got an ex-girlfriend
who works for a bondsman.

19:15.650 --> 19:16.947
She asked around,
found out that

19:16.980 --> 19:19.414
the company that wrote bail
for Langston

19:19.450 --> 19:20.678
had a bounty on him.

19:20.720 --> 19:22.950
Now, they never
pinned him down.

19:22.990 --> 19:23.957
Pretty sure

19:23.990 --> 19:25.480
he's in Jersey with his cousins.

19:25.530 --> 19:26.622
That helps, right?

19:26.660 --> 19:28.890
Yeah, I'm gonna send this

19:28.930 --> 19:31.262
to the people that I work with,
they'll jump on it right away.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.858
It still doesn't
make up for the fact

19:32.900 --> 19:34.936
that, uh,
you can't pick a lock.

19:34.970 --> 19:36.665
I told you I've been busy.

19:36.700 --> 19:37.928
You asked for our help.

19:37.970 --> 19:40.530
We invested our time and energy
teaching you.

19:40.580 --> 19:42.275
We put in the effort;
you haven't.

19:42.310 --> 19:44.278
I can see why you think that,
but you're wrong.

19:44.310 --> 19:45.379
I asked you for help

19:45.410 --> 19:46.775
taking down my old gang

19:46.810 --> 19:47.879
and everything I've been doing

19:47.920 --> 19:49.217
has been working toward that.

19:49.250 --> 19:50.615
What do you mean?

19:50.650 --> 19:52.311
Doesn't matter
what kind of

19:52.350 --> 19:55.387
confidential informant y'all
train me to be if I don't

19:55.420 --> 19:58.218
get to inform on
the right people.

19:58.260 --> 19:59.887
Now I've been working
on this deal

19:59.930 --> 20:01.397
that's gonna push me
up the ladder.

20:02.430 --> 20:03.966
A drug deal.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.558
SBK don't run a coffee shop.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.261
I reached out

20:07.300 --> 20:08.528
to an old prison buddy.

20:08.570 --> 20:09.832
He got the hookup with coke

20:09.870 --> 20:11.269
and "X" from Montreal.

20:11.310 --> 20:12.538
IfI can get him
to bring his price down,

20:12.570 --> 20:14.538
SBK'II love this dude,

20:14.580 --> 20:16.639
and they'll love me
bringing him in.

20:16.680 --> 20:19.001
This is a terrible idea
even if it works,

20:19.050 --> 20:20.312
especially if it works.

20:20.350 --> 20:21.578
You're not ready for this.

20:21.620 --> 20:22.814
It's almost done.

20:22.850 --> 20:24.010
I'm talking
about the next step.

20:24.050 --> 20:25.847
I mean, these people
that you're going after,

20:25.890 --> 20:28.688
the shot callers for SBK,
they're a lot sharper

20:28.720 --> 20:30.426
than these lieutenants
you've been deaIIng WIth.

20:30.460 --> 20:33.327
They're smart
and they're paranoid.

20:33.360 --> 20:35.328
If I didn't go away,
I'd be one of these guys.

20:35.360 --> 20:36.497
I grew up with them.

20:36.530 --> 20:38.418
I appreciate your help, Doc,

20:38.470 --> 20:40.438
but I got this.

20:42.300 --> 20:46.009
This perp of yours...
this his uncle's place?

20:46.040 --> 20:47.530
Yeah, Lonny Tucker,

20:47.580 --> 20:49.332
82, he's a combat vet.

20:49.380 --> 20:50.608
(doorbell rings)

20:50.650 --> 20:52.277
Doesn't sound
like the kind of guy

20:52.310 --> 20:54.517
who'd harbor a fugitive.

20:54.550 --> 20:56.313
Seems Mr. Tucker's
physically disabled.

20:56.350 --> 20:57.248
(knock on door)

20:57.290 --> 20:58.848
DETECTIVE: Doesn't sound
like anybody's home.

20:58.890 --> 21:00.778
Well, nobody else
in Mr. Langston's family

21:00.820 --> 21:02.287
likes talking to the cops.

21:02.320 --> 21:04.424
Maybe he's just waiting
to see if we'll go away.

21:04.460 --> 21:07.952
Well, his car's here.
Want to look out back?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.956
Finally got a signal.
I'm gonna call Watson.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.594
See if her and the captain
have made any progress.

21:12.630 --> 21:14.996
This is Joan. Leave a message.

21:15.040 --> 21:19.306
Hello. Looks like we're looking
at, uh, as you would say,

21:19.340 --> 21:20.034
strike number three.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.809
Mr. Langston.

21:22.840 --> 21:24.603
Put the gun down. Put the gun
down. The police are here.

21:24.650 --> 21:25.708
Get out of my way.

21:25.750 --> 21:27.445
I-I-I can't do that.
I-I-I can't.

21:27.480 --> 21:28.947
I'm not going back in.

21:28.980 --> 21:30.345
No, I-I'm not here
about your old case.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.346
I just want to know
where Preeda Boonark is.

21:32.390 --> 21:33.459
What?

21:33.490 --> 21:34.479
Where are you keeping her?

21:34.520 --> 21:35.987
Where is she?
I don't know what

21:36.020 --> 21:37.089
you're talking about.

21:37.120 --> 21:39.452
Get out my way!
BELL:
Put it down!

21:39.490 --> 21:40.559
Now!

21:43.500 --> 21:44.728
You heard me.

21:48.500 --> 21:50.092
Against the wall.

21:50.140 --> 21:52.768
Against the wall.

21:56.380 --> 21:57.472
You all right?

21:57.510 --> 21:59.501
Yeah.

22:03.080 --> 22:05.014
He's not Ryan Decker's
accomplice.

22:11.830 --> 22:15.550
HOLMES: And there we have it.
10:37 am. yesterday morning.

22:15.600 --> 22:16.749
What are we looking at here?

22:16.800 --> 22:18.563
It's footage
from the Luclq Alexa.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.591
Like many commercial
fishing boats,

22:20.640 --> 22:22.494
it has cameras on board
'cause the owners often

22:22.540 --> 22:25.839
don't trust the crews to bring
the entire catch back to shore.

22:25.870 --> 22:28.475
That's Darnell Langston?
Yup.

22:28.510 --> 22:29.306
He's been employed
off the books

22:29.340 --> 22:30.671
on boats like these
since last June.

22:30.710 --> 22:33.099
And this footage
captures a fugitive

22:33.150 --> 22:34.469
from justice in the act

22:34.520 --> 22:35.669
of quietly doing his job.

22:35.720 --> 22:37.142
It also proves

22:37.180 --> 22:39.819
that he is not on the phone
at precisely the moment

22:39.850 --> 22:41.078
that Ryan Decker
called his accomplice.

22:41.120 --> 22:43.486
How did you know
to look for this?

22:43.530 --> 22:45.657
Well, I-I thought it
unlikely that the damp

22:45.690 --> 22:48.056
fishing waders by his front door
belonged to his elderly uncle,

22:48.100 --> 22:49.954
and they seemed
to be almost dry

22:50.000 --> 22:51.695
after a day
on the hook, so...

22:51.730 --> 22:53.095
I thought he'd be
on a boat yesterday.

22:53.130 --> 22:56.099
But they got cell phones
on boats.

22:56.140 --> 22:57.539
Yeah, but he stank
of black sea cod,

22:57.570 --> 22:58.798
and the fishing grounds
for that species

22:58.840 --> 23:00.068
are miles offshore, so...

23:00.110 --> 23:02.635
We wasted a day on
the wrong accomplice.

23:02.680 --> 23:04.500
No, it's worse than that.

23:04.550 --> 23:05.744
You heard from the DA.

23:05.780 --> 23:06.872
Found a friendly judge

23:06.910 --> 23:08.411
who will let us do

23:08.450 --> 23:09.940
electronic surveillance.

23:09.980 --> 23:12.642
We can put a tail on Decker,
but we got to cut him loose.

23:14.760 --> 23:17.923
Decker, get up.

23:17.960 --> 23:20.827
You're out of here.

23:28.140 --> 23:30.768
Not nice being
imprisoned, is it?

23:30.810 --> 23:32.437
I hope you had occasion
to ponder your future

23:32.470 --> 23:34.631
under lock and key,
living in fear

23:34.680 --> 23:36.568
of the next sexual assault.

23:36.610 --> 23:39.545
Rarely is justice so fitting
as it will be in your case.

23:39.580 --> 23:41.468
Well, would it make you guys
feel better

23:41.520 --> 23:43.169
if I just admitted
to what I did, huh?

23:44.250 --> 23:45.717
Maybe I'd feel better, too.

23:45.750 --> 23:47.559
Right? 'Cause the truth is,

23:47.590 --> 23:49.558
I-I'm ashamed of what I did,

23:49.590 --> 23:51.057
and I hope you believe me.

23:51.090 --> 23:52.159
I... I didn't even

23:52.190 --> 23:53.589
like Mannequin that much.

23:53.630 --> 23:54.654
Actually, this isn't

23:54.700 --> 23:56.622
about your pirated movies.

23:56.660 --> 23:58.127
We're here to make a deal.

23:58.170 --> 23:59.569
Oh, yeah?
What-What are you selling?

23:59.600 --> 24:01.136
GREGSON:
You name your partner,

24:01.170 --> 24:03.161
you tell us
where Preeda Boonark is,

24:03.200 --> 24:05.703
and the DA. can save
the harshest treatment

24:05.740 --> 24:07.628
for your coconspirator.

24:07.680 --> 24:11.002
(chuckles)
Hey, you guys

24:11.050 --> 24:12.972
have a good night.

24:13.010 --> 24:14.944
I know I will.

24:51.790 --> 24:53.758
What's up, Diego?

24:53.790 --> 24:55.849
My son's got a dentist
appointment in the morning,

24:55.890 --> 24:57.209
so let's make this quick.

24:57.260 --> 24:58.921
What you got to say?

24:58.960 --> 25:01.155
My people are interested.
They know you got good product,

25:01.200 --> 25:03.259
but they got their own hookup.

25:03.300 --> 25:05.860
Now, as much as I want
to make this happen,

25:05.900 --> 25:08.232
I don't think
they'll switch suppliers

25:08.270 --> 25:10.738
to save just
one grand a kilo.

25:10.770 --> 25:13.534
Look, man, it's not good.
It's the best.

25:13.580 --> 25:16.674
Take it to your people.
Have them test it.

25:16.710 --> 25:17.802
Don't need to.

25:17.850 --> 25:20.239
No? _
You say It,
I trust you,

25:20.280 --> 25:24.546
and if it was garbage,
our customers ain't real choosy.

25:24.590 --> 25:28.014
No, this got to be about
dollars and cents, feel me?

25:29.290 --> 25:30.780
You're getting
ahead of yourself.

25:30.830 --> 25:32.286
Oh, come on.

25:32.330 --> 25:34.651
You didn't have me
come all the way down here

25:34.700 --> 25:37.260
to give me free samples,
did you?

25:37.300 --> 25:40.269
I came all the way down here
because you said

25:40.300 --> 25:42.860
that we could move things
down the field.

25:45.370 --> 25:48.032
Now... are you gonna
take a taste

25:48.080 --> 25:50.036
back to your people or not?

25:52.150 --> 25:53.970
Shinwell.

25:54.020 --> 25:57.547
Say something...
or get the hell out of my car.

25:59.920 --> 26:02.218
(jazz playing)

26:04.230 --> 26:07.119
Is that peanut butter and jelly
and smooth jazz?

26:08.230 --> 26:09.652
I thought you were down here

26:09.700 --> 26:11.292
trying to find
Decker's accomplice.

26:11.330 --> 26:12.888
Iam.

26:12.930 --> 26:13.567
Well, then isn't it time

26:13.600 --> 26:15.636
to turn up the thrash metal,

26:15.670 --> 26:16.762
dangle from gravity boots,

26:16.800 --> 26:18.802
or, I don't know,
maybe snack

26:18.840 --> 26:22.674
on the world's stinkiest cheese
to shock the senses?

26:22.710 --> 26:25.804
Trying something even more
radical this evening: boredom.

26:25.850 --> 26:27.875
Might be just the change
of pace that's required.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.649
Never attempted that before:

26:29.680 --> 26:33.241
a breakthrough fueled
by ennui and masochism.

26:34.290 --> 26:36.053
You're sulking.

26:36.090 --> 26:38.081
Well, that seems like
a justifiable response

26:38.130 --> 26:39.825
to _the state _
of our InvestIgatIon.

26:42.660 --> 26:43.968
(sighs)

26:44.000 --> 26:46.264
You feel responsible
for Preeda.

26:46.300 --> 26:48.063
I am responsible.

26:48.100 --> 26:50.398
You know, her situation
wasn't too great

26:50.440 --> 26:52.829
before you ran into Decker.

26:52.870 --> 26:55.407
No, but I've likely accelerated
her demise.

26:55.440 --> 26:57.806
They now have an incentive
to dispose of her,

26:57.850 --> 26:59.169
and there's no
getting around that.

26:59.210 --> 27:01.849
And there's no other
potential suspects on this list?

27:01.880 --> 27:03.279
I vetted a dozen candidates:

27:03.320 --> 27:06.687
Decker's former colleagues,
high school chums,

27:06.720 --> 27:08.415
even some online associates.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.416
None of them seem
remotely capable

27:10.460 --> 27:12.883
of keeping Preeda Boonark
in human bondage.

27:12.930 --> 27:16.855
Well, they're in here somewhere
and we are gonna find them.

27:16.900 --> 27:20.267
I thought Shinwell was
coming over for a lesson.

27:20.300 --> 27:22.336
He was, but he's been
very busy lately.

27:22.370 --> 27:24.930
He's working on a drug deal.
It's taking up all of his time.

27:24.970 --> 27:28.872
He's eager to impress
the, uh, heads of SBK,

27:28.910 --> 27:30.104
and that doesn't concern you.

27:30.140 --> 27:32.074
Of course it does.
Itold him it did...

27:32.110 --> 27:35.011
but if there's one thing I
learned as a sober companion,

27:35.050 --> 27:37.177
that good advice is just advice.
(phone ringing)

27:37.220 --> 27:39.279
He doesn't want to listen,
there's nothing I can do.

27:41.960 --> 27:43.723
Captain, you have me and Watson.

27:43.760 --> 27:45.079
GREGSON: Good, you should both
get down here.

27:45.130 --> 27:47.792
We lost Decker.

27:49.300 --> 27:52.724
We had two plainclothesmen
on Ryan Decker.

27:52.770 --> 27:54.362
They called in about midnight

27:54.400 --> 27:56.960
to say that he was
on the move leaving his house.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.036
So, they followed him
at a close distance,

27:59.070 --> 28:00.230
but they didn't stay
close enough

28:00.270 --> 28:02.033
because they lost him

28:02.080 --> 28:03.377
when he hopped on the "A" train.

28:03.410 --> 28:04.479
After that, all we had
was the signal

28:04.510 --> 28:06.102
from his cell.

28:06.150 --> 28:07.469
He turned his phone back on.

28:07.510 --> 28:08.977
No, he got another one,
but we were up on it.

28:09.020 --> 28:10.817
He must've been suspicious

28:10.850 --> 28:11.885
because his signal
dropped out

28:11.920 --> 28:13.911
right after his train departed

28:13.960 --> 28:15.313
Beach 98th.

28:15.360 --> 28:18.921
He turned it off right here.

28:18.960 --> 28:20.188
Oh, looks like he was headed

28:20.230 --> 28:22.824
toward the end
of the IND Rockaway Line.

28:22.860 --> 28:23.861
Yeah, that's what
it looked like,

28:23.900 --> 28:24.992
but the transit cops out there

28:25.030 --> 28:26.463
say he wasn't on the train

28:26.500 --> 28:28.468
when it pulled
into the Rockaway Park Station.

28:28.500 --> 28:29.967
So, he got off at 105th Street.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.331
Yeah. We're pulling video
to confirm,

28:31.370 --> 28:32.837
but that's what we think.

28:32.870 --> 28:34.929
They put it over the air
within 15 minutes,

28:34.980 --> 28:37.403
but I got to say,
I'm not optimistic.

28:40.080 --> 28:42.469
before anyone knew
to look for him.

28:42.520 --> 28:45.489
There's got to be 2,000 houses
inside that radius.

28:45.520 --> 28:47.044
And even more places

28:47.090 --> 28:48.785
to stash a getaway vehicle,

28:48.820 --> 28:49.980
never mind a woman.

28:50.020 --> 28:51.055
We should get out there

28:51.090 --> 28:52.751
and help them with the search.

28:52.790 --> 28:54.155
Well, I'd be happy to,
but it'd be less of a search

28:54.200 --> 28:55.952
and more like aimless wandering.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.093
We don't have the first
idea where to look.

28:58.130 --> 28:58.926
Let's start near the shore.

28:58.970 --> 28:59.925
There were several

28:59.970 --> 29:03.098
beach-themed paintings
at Ryan Decker's home.

29:03.140 --> 29:04.960
They were stylistically bland,
but, uh,

29:05.010 --> 29:06.807
I think they were created
by the same hand.

29:06.840 --> 29:07.875
WATSON:
You think Decker

29:07.910 --> 29:09.229
painted them himself.

29:09.280 --> 29:10.304
The paintings of the dunes,

29:10.340 --> 29:11.944
the sand color, sea grasses,

29:11.980 --> 29:12.969
they were consistent
with what you would find

29:13.010 --> 29:14.147
at Rockaway Beach.

29:14.180 --> 29:16.114
It's a remote location.

29:16.150 --> 29:18.311
Somewhere he knows well, and
it's adjacent to a body of water

29:18.350 --> 29:19.510
if he were inclined

29:19.550 --> 29:20.881
to dispose of a corpse.

29:20.920 --> 29:22.182
GREGSON:
Hey, Scott.

29:22.220 --> 29:24.324
I want you to pull some units
off the street.

29:24.360 --> 29:26.783
Get some guys and a K-9 unit,

29:26.830 --> 29:31.028
and comb the dunes
near Beach 105th, all right?

29:31.070 --> 29:34.062
Captain Gregson.

29:34.100 --> 29:36.432
Right this way.
What do we got?

29:36.470 --> 29:38.335
Lot of blood.

29:38.370 --> 29:40.361
Dogs went nuts.

29:40.410 --> 29:42.833
No body?
No, sir.

29:42.880 --> 29:45.542
But the K-9 unit found
some tracks out onto the beach.

29:45.580 --> 29:49.016
Could be someone got
carried out and sunk.

29:49.050 --> 29:51.041
Of course, there's no way to
know if this has anything to do

29:51.090 --> 29:54.082
with your case, but maybe
you'll see something I didn't.

29:57.390 --> 29:58.982
WATSON:
If this is all from one person,

29:59.030 --> 30:00.156
there's no way they
could've survived

30:00.190 --> 30:02.055
after losing this much blood.

30:02.100 --> 30:05.069
GREGSON:
Any casings or slugs?

30:05.100 --> 30:07.830
Pattern's too wide
for a bullet wound.

30:07.870 --> 30:11.567
Absorbent material like sand
would contaIn any seepage.

30:11.610 --> 30:13.305
If Decker and his accomplice
did bring Preeda out here,

30:13.340 --> 30:15.535
they did so to sever
her carotid artery

30:15.580 --> 30:17.104
and then dispose of the body.

30:19.580 --> 30:22.014
Has a sample been
sent off to the lab yet?

30:22.050 --> 30:24.518
CSU says the sand will
make things a little tricky.

30:24.550 --> 30:26.347
It's gonna take
some time to process

30:26.390 --> 30:28.858
enough of the material
to make an identification.

30:28.890 --> 30:31.029
MAN:
Need a hand down here.

30:31.060 --> 30:32.925
I don't know if we'll ever
make an ID.

30:32.960 --> 30:34.427
Preeda Boonark's DNA

30:34.460 --> 30:36.496
isn't on file.

30:36.530 --> 30:38.896
You know, it's possible that
this isn't Preeda's blood.

30:41.070 --> 30:43.061
You think it could
be the accomplice?

30:43.100 --> 30:45.432
Decke_r lured him out here
and bed up a loose end?

30:45.470 --> 30:47.199
Would be nice, wouldn't it?

30:47.240 --> 30:49.105
HOLMES:
He's made his first mistake!

30:53.450 --> 30:54.917
What, they missed something?

30:54.950 --> 30:57.111
A set of keys.
Decker must've lost them

30:57.150 --> 30:59.448
as he struggled
to move the body.

30:59.490 --> 31:00.912
What makes you think
they're Decker's?
Let's just say

31:00.960 --> 31:02.188
I'm familiar with
the lock at his house

31:02.220 --> 31:03.949
and leave at that, shall we?

31:03.990 --> 31:05.127
This one's to a PO box.

31:05.160 --> 31:07.924
There's a number etched into it.

31:13.230 --> 31:15.095
1913 Erwin Road is
the little green house

31:15.140 --> 31:17.062
at the end of the next block.

31:17.100 --> 31:19.102
Employees at the mailbox
store I.D.'d Ryan Decker

31:19.140 --> 31:20.971
as the guy who parked the mail
for this address.

31:21.010 --> 31:24.446
Preeda Boonark has been held
in captivity for five years.

31:24.480 --> 31:27.608
Anybody behind that door
who is not this woman

31:27.650 --> 31:29.948
almost definitely knew
what was going on.

31:29.980 --> 31:31.516
They should be considered
armed and dangerous.

31:31.550 --> 31:34.018
You got that?

31:34.060 --> 31:35.948
Actually,

31:35.990 --> 31:38.379
you're not gonna be
needing that.

31:38.430 --> 31:39.988
SWAT 1 (over radio):
We're in. Entry's clear.

31:40.030 --> 31:42.396
SWAT 2: You hear that?
There's something in here.

31:42.430 --> 31:45.092
She's in here.
What'd he say?

31:45.130 --> 31:47.291
She's alive.
Where's Team Leader?

31:47.330 --> 31:49.469
GREGSON: I need the
investigative unit up here

31:49.500 --> 31:52.936
right away.

31:52.970 --> 31:55.234
Sit tight. Right here.

31:55.280 --> 31:57.669
The captain asked for us.
I'm gonna bring him to you.

31:57.710 --> 32:01.168
This location isn't secure.

32:01.220 --> 32:03.245
There's no doorknob
on the inside.

32:03.280 --> 32:06.408
ESU OFFICER 1:
She was locked up in there,
Captain, behind the door.

32:07.990 --> 32:11.721
(indistinct radio transmission)

32:11.760 --> 32:14.126
That's not Preeda Boonark.

32:17.030 --> 32:20.522
Here, you sit down.

32:25.610 --> 32:27.032
Do you know who she is?

32:27.070 --> 32:29.732
She says her name
is Benita Sakda.

32:29.780 --> 32:31.543
Decker's had her
here two months.

32:31.580 --> 32:33.639
She's never seen an accomplice,
and she's never seen

32:33.680 --> 32:35.272
Preeda Boonark.

32:35.320 --> 32:37.117
The video I saw was taken
last Tuesday.

32:37.150 --> 32:38.378
WATSON:
He must've had Preeda

32:38.420 --> 32:39.978
someplace else.

32:40.020 --> 32:42.113
Before he took her to the beach
and cut her throat.

32:42.160 --> 32:44.754
That woman would never have
walked out of here alive

32:44.790 --> 32:46.087
if you hadn't spotted Decker.

32:46.130 --> 32:47.449
Take a minute
and let that sink in.

32:47.490 --> 32:48.718
Well, I'll take a minute when

32:48.760 --> 32:51.069
we find the men responsible.

32:58.640 --> 32:59.561
She gonna be okay?

32:59.610 --> 33:01.430
Physically, yeah.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.175
She's still in shock.

33:03.210 --> 33:04.768
She swears she never
saw an accompIIce,

33:04.810 --> 33:06.243
only ever saw Decker.

33:06.280 --> 33:07.577
How did he get her?

33:07.610 --> 33:09.009
She was at a bus stop,
it was raining.

33:09.050 --> 33:10.278
He offered her a ride.

33:10.320 --> 33:14.051
(phone chimes)

33:15.320 --> 33:16.457
What is it?

33:16.490 --> 33:18.026
Lab confirmed blood at beach

33:18.060 --> 33:19.527
was human.

33:19.560 --> 33:22.120
Preeda Boonark's family
overseas will get DNA sample

33:22.160 --> 33:24.367
to confirm.
Oh, that's what he meant.

33:25.700 --> 33:26.621
Come take a look at the fridge.

33:30.400 --> 33:31.560
Looks pretty full.

33:31.610 --> 33:33.362
And quite recently stocked,

33:33.410 --> 33:34.638
judging by the expiration date

33:34.680 --> 33:36.602
on the, uh, soy milk.

33:36.640 --> 33:39.040
He told the guy
to take care of her.

33:39.080 --> 33:41.674
I assumed that that was
instruction to kill Preeda,

33:41.720 --> 33:43.745
but he was referring
to his other captive.

33:43.780 --> 33:45.611
His accomplice must've run
these supplies over.

33:45.650 --> 33:47.686
He was taking care of her

33:47.720 --> 33:50.712
in the literal sense.

33:54.100 --> 33:57.126
Excuse me, guys.
Um...

33:57.160 --> 33:58.491
Could you just hold
on a second? Benita,

33:58.530 --> 34:00.327
are you lactose intolerant?

34:00.370 --> 34:01.598
BENITA:
I don't think so.

34:01.640 --> 34:03.733
What is that?
Okay, the milk here,

34:03.770 --> 34:04.668
does Ryan always bring

34:04.710 --> 34:05.734
the same kind?

34:05.770 --> 34:07.601
_ BENITA:
mm! a couple days ago,

34:07.640 --> 34:09.471
there's a new kind
in the fridge.

34:09.510 --> 34:11.307
Okay, did you see
who put it there?

34:11.350 --> 34:13.773
It was there
when I woke up yesterday.

34:13.810 --> 34:16.745
Ryan's been saying he wanted me
to lose weight, so I thought

34:16.780 --> 34:18.782
thats”.
(shudders)

34:18.820 --> 34:20.447
Is something wrong with it?
No, no, it's fine.

34:20.490 --> 34:21.718
You're fine,
you're gonna be okay.

34:21.760 --> 34:24.126
Thank you.

34:24.160 --> 34:25.457
What was that?

34:25.490 --> 34:27.629
May I?

34:27.660 --> 34:29.218
When people go
to the grocery store,

34:29.260 --> 34:30.625
they tend to buy their
favorite brands, right?

34:30.660 --> 34:32.719
It doesn't matter if

34:32.770 --> 34:33.759
they're in their own
neighborhood or if on

34:33.800 --> 34:35.233
the other side of the country.

34:35.270 --> 34:36.692
People buy what they know.

34:36.740 --> 34:38.469
So you're saying our accomplice
likes soy milk?

34:38.510 --> 34:39.636
Not just soy milk,

34:39.670 --> 34:41.809
this brand of soy milk.
I saw her use it.

34:41.840 --> 34:44.308
Her?
Carrie Traub was drinking coffee

34:44.350 --> 34:45.806
when I went to see her at ICE.

34:45.850 --> 34:47.670
She had soy creamer
at her desk.

34:47.710 --> 34:48.711
The same brand as this one.

34:48.750 --> 34:50.149
Well, if there's
prints on there,

34:50.180 --> 34:51.818
your theory'll be
easy enough to test.

34:51.850 --> 34:54.410
But his ex?
I thought she hated Decker.

34:54.460 --> 34:57.258
I think she does, but maybe
because she knows him better

34:57.290 --> 34:59.155
than anyone else.
What are you talking about?

34:59.190 --> 35:01.420
Why would she help him
with this?

35:01.460 --> 35:02.825
They've been divorced
for six years.

35:02.860 --> 35:05.727
Preeda's only been missing
for five.

35:05.770 --> 35:07.761
We don't know it's
the first woman he took.

35:07.800 --> 35:10.860
You think they kept
women together as a team?

35:10.900 --> 35:13.733
Wouldn't be the first couple
to share moral deformities.

35:13.770 --> 35:15.704
Maybe now Carrie has to keep

35:15.740 --> 35:17.879
Ryan's secret so
he'll keep hers.

35:19.710 --> 35:21.712
*

35:25.390 --> 35:26.846
(loud bang)

35:26.890 --> 35:28.414
(footfalls and
indistinct chatter approaching)

35:28.460 --> 35:31.224
(door opens)

35:31.260 --> 35:33.251
Police!
Show me your hands!

35:33.290 --> 35:35.724
Drop it!

35:38.800 --> 35:40.791
(indistinct radio chatter)

35:46.470 --> 35:48.631
The _deed to the house is still
In my name, Isn't It?

35:48.680 --> 35:50.432
Decker get it in the divorce?

35:51.910 --> 35:53.400
Can't imagine

35:53.450 --> 35:56.271
why he didn't file the paperwork
to get his name on it.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.743
Shut the door, please.
BELL:
I don't know why you're still

35:58.790 --> 36:00.382
carrying his water,
but it's over now.

36:00.420 --> 36:01.614
Tell us where he is.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.753
Shut the door.
ESU OFFICER:
Hey!

36:03.790 --> 36:05.929
Someone's in the trunk here!

36:05.960 --> 36:08.394
Is it Ryan?

36:09.800 --> 36:11.529
Does he have a weapon?

36:11.570 --> 36:13.299
Stay with her.

36:13.330 --> 36:14.467
You got car keys there?

36:14.500 --> 36:16.491
Yes, sir.

36:20.510 --> 36:23.399
(light pounding from the trunk)
(quietly):
On three.

36:25.280 --> 36:27.544
(car alarm chirps)

36:28.450 --> 36:29.815
MAN:
Get EMT down here!

36:29.850 --> 36:31.841
(gasps)

36:34.890 --> 36:35.879
(Preeda whimpering)

36:37.390 --> 36:39.551
Come here, come here.

36:40.990 --> 36:42.548
There, you all right?

36:56.310 --> 36:58.346
You admiring
yourself, Ms. Traub?

36:58.380 --> 37:00.940
Or are you checking
for blood spatter

37:00.980 --> 37:02.868
from when you murdered
your ex-husband?

37:04.490 --> 37:06.446
When we found all that blood at
Rockaway Beach,

37:06.490 --> 37:07.980
we thought it belonged
to Preeda Boonark

37:08.020 --> 37:10.352
or Ryan's accomplice.

37:10.390 --> 37:13.359
We were wrong.
It was Ryan's.

37:13.390 --> 37:17.429
He wasn't the one tying up
loose ends, you were.

37:17.460 --> 37:19.428
Killing him may have been
a public service,

37:19.470 --> 37:21.495
_ but it's also _
a faIrly serIous crIme.

37:21.540 --> 37:23.667
WATSON:
It's not your only one, either.

37:23.700 --> 37:24.803
We've been double-checking
the investigations

37:24.840 --> 37:25.761
you've overseen at ICE.

37:25.810 --> 37:27.437
Taking a closer look at

37:27.470 --> 37:28.801
any missing women
you've declared

37:28.840 --> 37:30.979
illegal immigrants.
GREGSON:
A couple of them

37:31.010 --> 37:32.648
back when you were
married to Ryan.

37:32.680 --> 37:35.478
I can't say I agree
with your conclusions.

37:35.520 --> 37:38.318
I'm not saying anything here.

37:38.350 --> 37:39.715
I think you should.

37:39.750 --> 37:41.786
You can start with
how you killed your ex

37:41.820 --> 37:42.809
in the dunes.

37:42.860 --> 37:44.919
It'll mean more to the DA.

37:44.960 --> 37:47.827
if you cop to it now before
the blood evidence confirms it.

37:47.860 --> 37:50.988
I'm not discussing anything
until I see my attorney.

37:58.870 --> 38:01.475
Maybe somebody did
dump Ryan in the ocean.

38:01.510 --> 38:04.809
Or maybe they
took him someplace else.

38:04.850 --> 38:06.909
Either way, you're gonna
be looking for his body

38:06.950 --> 38:08.645
for a long time.

38:08.680 --> 38:11.319
No, Ms. Traub, Ryan Decker's
miserable life is over.

38:11.350 --> 38:13.545
He can rot where he is.

38:13.590 --> 38:16.411
And the same goes for you.

38:23.460 --> 38:24.825
Hey.

38:24.870 --> 38:27.794
This antique straight
shackle's killing me, Doc.

38:27.830 --> 38:29.639
I wanted to

38:29.670 --> 38:31.399
get them all done
before you got back.

38:31.440 --> 38:34.000
Uh, that one is rusted shut.

38:34.040 --> 38:35.075
This is incredible.
You've picked,

38:35.110 --> 38:37.476
what, 20 locks?

38:37.510 --> 38:39.398
23, counting breaking in here.

38:39.450 --> 38:41.509
When did you find the time
to practice?

38:41.550 --> 38:43.609
Uh...

38:43.650 --> 38:45.345
my deal fell through.

38:45.390 --> 38:46.618
Actually, I called it off.

38:46.650 --> 38:47.981
Guy I was buying from

38:48.020 --> 38:49.988
got squirrelly,
kept touching his face.

38:50.020 --> 38:53.057
Then I remembered something you
told me last week about, uh...

38:53.090 --> 38:54.990
Haptics.
Right.

38:55.030 --> 38:56.918
I knew he was lying about
something, I could tell.

38:56.960 --> 39:00.088
So I did some checking.
His connections are dry.

39:00.130 --> 39:02.530
He was gonna ask me for half
the money up front and bounce.

39:02.570 --> 39:03.935
Can't imagine your bosses

39:03.970 --> 39:05.369
would be too happy
to hear that.

39:05.410 --> 39:07.059
They would've lit me up.

39:07.110 --> 39:09.601
I know you think I don't pay
attention to you,

39:09.640 --> 39:11.608
but...

39:11.650 --> 39:13.572
well, thank you.

39:13.610 --> 39:15.373
Have you eaten yet?

39:15.420 --> 39:18.912
I was gonna grab something
on my way home.

39:18.950 --> 39:21.453
Quieres compartir mi gnocchi?

39:23.190 --> 39:26.921
Uh, why don't you
make yourself a plate.

39:26.960 --> 39:28.689
It's good that you
can pick locks now,

39:28.730 --> 39:30.027
but we have to work
on your Spanish.

39:30.060 --> 39:34.531
* Now I've made
an error or two *

39:34.570 --> 39:37.960
* Sometimes wrongly accused.
