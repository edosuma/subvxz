10:32.390 --> 10:35.117
The cubby set is
a type of trap set

10:35.151 --> 10:36.325
that I've never built before.

10:36.359 --> 10:37.913
I've just seen drawings of it.

10:37.947 --> 10:40.432
And it's like a little
A-frame log cabin.

10:40.467 --> 10:41.779
You put the bait
in the back of it

10:41.813 --> 10:44.091
and the only way into it
is through the front.

10:44.126 --> 10:46.093
And hopefully the wolverine
will come by

10:46.128 --> 10:48.302
and see some more tasty treats.

10:48.337 --> 10:52.444
He'll try to get in there
to get them, and snap.

10:52.479 --> 10:53.756

most of what he knows

several poles

11:03.801 --> 11:06.424

all up into length.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.909
When the poles are done,
I'm gonna kind of pound

11:08.944 --> 11:11.187

11:11.222 --> 11:14.018
wire them together
in an A-frame configuration,

11:14.052 --> 11:17.987
and hopefully the door will be
about the same size as the trap.

11:18.022 --> 11:19.092
I've never made one of these.

11:19.126 --> 11:20.749

to be real careful

11:27.307 --> 11:29.343

11:29.378 --> 11:30.448
If could definitely catch me.

11:30.482 --> 11:32.622

tremendous and strong animal,

trap is really well anchored,

free to tackle a special order

running the lines.

12:22.224 --> 12:24.674

what could be a $1,000 payday.

Primitive arrows, like I make,
sell up for $100 a piece,

12:56.085 --> 12:58.398
A few of the shafts
that I've cut today

12:58.432 --> 13:01.263
probably won't work at all.

13:01.297 --> 13:03.196
There will be a knot
in one of them

13:03.230 --> 13:05.060
that just won't straighten out.

13:05.094 --> 13:07.338
And it's a real important thing.

13:07.372 --> 13:09.616
I mean, your arrow
has to be straight

13:09.650 --> 13:12.757
or it won't fly straight.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.621
Narrator: Heating the wood makes
it pliable enough

13:14.655 --> 13:16.934
to bend and straighten.

13:16.968 --> 13:21.421
If you heat the wood up
and hold it until it cools off,

13:21.455 --> 13:27.220
then you can take the bends out
just through heat and pressure.

13:27.254 --> 13:29.843
You just have to straighten it
all just by eye

13:29.878 --> 13:31.362
and looking down the shaft.

13:31.396 --> 13:34.330
Slowly but surely, you keep
doing that over and over again,

13:34.365 --> 13:38.990
you'll come up
with a straight shaft.

13:39.025 --> 13:40.336
All right.

13:40.371 --> 13:41.855
Narrator: A wood planer
trims the shafts

13:41.890 --> 13:43.719
down to a uniform size,

13:43.753 --> 13:46.377
which ensures that
each individual arrow

13:46.411 --> 13:48.482
performs to the same standard.

13:48.517 --> 13:54.868
You want all your arrow shafts
to be the same diameter,

13:54.903 --> 13:57.353
same length,
and therefore,

13:57.388 --> 14:00.667
they'll all shoot
more consistent.

14:00.701 --> 14:04.705
The Native Americans
used sandstone,

14:04.740 --> 14:06.673
put a groove on the top,

14:06.707 --> 14:08.606
a groove on the bottom

14:08.640 --> 14:11.678
and held it right like this.

14:11.712 --> 14:13.507
And once the stones
come together

14:13.542 --> 14:16.786
then it's the right size.

14:16.821 --> 14:18.961
Narrator: Once the arrows
are formed and shaped,

14:18.996 --> 14:22.413
they're decorated
with a traditional design.

14:22.447 --> 14:27.314
A friend of mine gave me
an old primitive arrow

14:27.349 --> 14:30.697
that had to be 200 years old.

14:30.731 --> 14:35.633
The color that they were painted
with is what I copy.

14:35.667 --> 14:38.808
And the reason is because
anybody could have looked

14:38.843 --> 14:40.189
at an arrow

14:40.224 --> 14:43.054
and they would know
whose arrow it was

14:43.089 --> 14:47.783
because of the way
it was painted.

14:47.817 --> 14:49.923
I'm gonna start to get
some feathers ready

14:49.958 --> 14:51.718
to put on them arrows.

14:51.752 --> 14:56.033
The feathers that I'm using
are off of a wild turkey.

14:56.067 --> 14:58.552
Narrator: Attaching feathers
to the end of the arrows

14:58.587 --> 15:02.625
is a delicate process
known as fletching.

15:02.660 --> 15:05.732
Tom: This is what makes
the arrow shoot straight.

15:05.766 --> 15:08.631
There is a light twist
in the feathers.

15:08.666 --> 15:10.944
They're turned just
a little bit.

15:10.979 --> 15:14.568
And what that does is
that makes the arrow rotate.

15:14.603 --> 15:16.639
Like, as it comes from the bow,

15:16.674 --> 15:20.298
when it goes out,
the end will be wobbling.

15:20.333 --> 15:24.061
And after 6 or 8 feet,
it will start rotating

15:24.095 --> 15:26.649
and then it'll stabilize itself

15:26.684 --> 15:28.928
and it'll shoot straight.

15:28.962 --> 15:32.138
The last step is putting
the point on the arrow.

15:32.172 --> 15:37.039
And I've got some steel
points that I'm using.

15:37.074 --> 15:39.455
That's what I've read
was used by lots

15:39.490 --> 15:41.975
of the Native Americans, too.

15:42.010 --> 15:44.978
In fact, the steel came
before the horses came

15:45.013 --> 15:47.774
because it was
such a trade item.

15:47.808 --> 15:52.779
And it was that that brought
the end of the old stone arrows.

15:52.813 --> 15:55.989
Most of the old stone
points are old, old.

15:56.024 --> 15:57.887
Thousands of years old.

15:57.922 --> 16:01.753
Where for the last 400 years,
probably, steel arrowheads

16:01.788 --> 16:03.790
were the most common points

16:03.824 --> 16:07.276
that were used
in North America.

16:07.311 --> 16:11.004
It's neat to be able to create
something like that

16:11.039 --> 16:13.869
from just wood and feathers

16:13.903 --> 16:16.009
