It's alive!

00:34.789 --> 00:36.157
Yes! Yes!

00:36.192 --> 00:36.958
Yes!

00:36.993 --> 00:39.493
It takes two for out of sight!

00:46.069 --> 00:46.701
D'oh!

00:46.736 --> 00:48.235
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

00:48.271 --> 00:50.671
I <i>told</i> you road
head was a bad idea.

00:50.740 --> 00:51.772
Hello, earthling.

00:51.841 --> 00:53.841
We were on... Oooh!

00:53.876 --> 00:55.309
Why are you...

01:01.249 --> 01:05.285
This is starting... to hurt...
Ohh!

01:05.385 --> 01:08.488
And that's what I did to
the first aliens I found.

01:08.523 --> 01:12.659
Unless you want some of the same, you
just better mind your P's and Q's.

01:14.262 --> 01:16.763
Honey, do you have to make
up such horrible stories?

01:16.831 --> 01:18.664
Martha, that boy is invulnerable.

01:18.700 --> 01:20.633
I can't just spank him.

01:20.767 --> 01:23.635
I don't often
drink beer, but when I do,

01:23.671 --> 01:25.772
I usually suck three
or four male penises.

01:25.840 --> 01:28.741
And on several nonconsecutive
occasions, I've run over a pet.

01:28.777 --> 01:31.211
Oh, and once, I
raped my own uncle.

01:31.246 --> 01:35.216
That is why I don't
often drink beer.

01:37.119 --> 01:41.189
Even though Janet is no longer with
us, she's still alive in my heart.

01:41.224 --> 01:42.623
I love you, my baby girl.

01:42.659 --> 01:46.460
We will now hear a few words
from Janet's friend Diablo Cody.

01:46.496 --> 01:48.663
Janet was a holympic athlete.

01:48.698 --> 01:50.632
And her sport? Flirting.

01:50.667 --> 01:52.567
When we hung out, it was
like Flirt and Ernie.

01:52.603 --> 01:55.737
Screw the recession...
That girl was <i>always</i> in business.

01:55.806 --> 01:57.839
She was hotter than
an oven on the sun.

01:57.875 --> 02:00.642
She was always sexting these
incredible hunks, like Josh.

02:00.677 --> 02:04.112
I thought he was a homo-skillet, but
that's besides the Tito Puente.

02:04.148 --> 02:07.115
On a scale of one to zen, Janet
was my "B" to the double "F" power,

02:07.150 --> 02:09.817
and I'm gonna miss
her like Demeanor Elliot.

02:09.852 --> 02:12.086
You know, Janet was my
fashionista sister.

02:12.121 --> 02:13.453
She had this one tube top.

02:13.489 --> 02:16.089
The thing made her look
like a pixy stick smuggling

02:16.158 --> 02:18.558
volleyballs smuggling
grapes smuggling craisins.

02:18.593 --> 02:21.561
So, put your mitts together
and make some Alfred.

02:21.596 --> 02:23.629
Alfred Noyes... the poet.

02:23.665 --> 02:24.464
Make some noise.

02:24.499 --> 02:26.265
All right, I'm out
like slap bracelets.

02:26.301 --> 02:28.001
Peace in the middle
yeast infection.

02:28.670 --> 02:30.704
Shut the up already!

02:30.739 --> 02:32.639
Mom, why is Diablo Cody here?

02:32.674 --> 02:34.908
Did you even read my suicide note?

02:36.845 --> 02:39.446
Most of us will die in Vietnam,
but at least it'll teach America

02:39.481 --> 02:42.615
a valuable lesson on
fighting needless wars.

02:47.622 --> 02:48.355
All right.

02:49.191 --> 02:49.889
Come on!

02:49.958 --> 02:50.357
Oh!

02:50.392 --> 02:51.157
No!

02:51.193 --> 02:53.059
You contra bastards!

02:53.094 --> 02:54.227
Or are <i>we</i> the contras?

02:54.262 --> 02:55.094
I never got that.

02:55.897 --> 02:56.529
I'm back!

02:56.565 --> 02:57.998
Blue pants! You're alive?!

02:58.033 --> 02:58.865
I guess so.

02:58.901 --> 02:59.966
Maybe we're immortal.

03:00.002 --> 03:02.068
Let's find out.

03:02.137 --> 03:03.069
Aah!

03:04.439 --> 03:06.072
"Groundhog Day"

03:06.108 --> 03:08.509
You want to kill
me, but you can't!

03:08.544 --> 03:10.878
Low hand, high hand, and
poke you in the peepers!

03:10.913 --> 03:11.879
Hey, check it out.

03:11.948 --> 03:12.680
Give me a hand.

03:12.715 --> 03:15.150
Ooh! Boom on your helmet!

03:15.218 --> 03:16.784
# Doing the running man #

03:16.820 --> 03:18.520
# running as fast as I can #

03:18.555 --> 03:19.621
Wall of spikes!

03:19.656 --> 03:20.622
Hey, how you doing?

03:20.657 --> 03:23.158
Excuse me, soldier, I was wondering...
Oh, yeah!

03:23.227 --> 03:23.859
Boom diggity!

03:23.894 --> 03:24.526
Ballsville!

03:24.561 --> 03:25.760
Oh, your pellet hurt me!

03:25.796 --> 03:27.762
Well, we'll shoot that one, and
that one explodes, and the

03:27.798 --> 03:29.664
other one explodes, and
we're left with nothing.

03:29.700 --> 03:31.500
Why is this bridge
self-destructive?

03:31.536 --> 03:32.335
Check it out.

03:32.370 --> 03:33.303
Thank you, sir.

03:33.338 --> 03:34.237
May I have another?

03:34.306 --> 03:36.706
A strange monster for this
industrial wasteland.

03:36.742 --> 03:39.042
Go, contra-a-a-a!

03:39.077 --> 03:39.976
Hey, check it out.

03:40.044 --> 03:41.477
Oh, is this a message in a bottle?

03:41.512 --> 03:42.512
Oh, no... a grenade!

03:42.580 --> 03:43.513
Oh, grab the kids!

03:43.548 --> 03:45.515
What are we gonna...
Wait a minute!

03:45.550 --> 03:48.117
I'm immortal

03:50.254 --> 03:51.420
Wait.

03:51.456 --> 03:52.154
Hey.

03:52.223 --> 03:52.888
No!

03:52.957 --> 03:57.126
What kind of sick
gives a man exactly 30 lives?

04:00.632 --> 04:03.499
You think a group of
children can stop <i>me?</i>

04:03.568 --> 04:06.103
<i>Come taste my magic
and know oblivion!</i>

04:06.138 --> 04:08.739
<i>You may be stronger, Venger, but
we're on the side of right,</i>

04:08.774 --> 04:11.042
<i>and that makes this battle
as lopsided as your helmet. </i>

04:11.111 --> 04:14.513
<i>My helmet? What are you...
Oh, you got to be kidding me. </i>

04:14.548 --> 04:17.850
<i>I've only had this
helmet for two months. </i>

04:19.886 --> 04:22.688
<i>Y-your ruse won't work, Venger. </i>

04:22.723 --> 04:23.222
<i>Face us!</i>

04:23.257 --> 04:25.591
<i>Will you shut up and help
me look for my horn?!</i>

04:25.660 --> 04:27.193
<i>A-are one of you standing on it?</i>

04:27.228 --> 04:28.394
<i>Uhh... W-what?!</i>

04:28.429 --> 04:29.929
<i>How would we be standing on it?</i>

04:29.964 --> 04:31.097
<i>I don't know, Diana. </i>

04:31.132 --> 04:35.201
But I <i>do</i> know that when I left home this
morning, I had two horns on my head.

04:35.236 --> 04:36.235
L- look, I-I'm sorry.

04:36.304 --> 04:39.405
The helmet was a gift from someone
who isn't with us anymore.

04:39.473 --> 04:42.040
So if I'm freaking out, it's just...
No, no.

04:42.075 --> 04:43.675
We'll... help you look for it.

04:43.710 --> 04:44.843
T- thanks, guys.

04:44.878 --> 04:46.311
Just... Thanks.

04:49.515 --> 04:51.649
Today, a blond, white girl
was brutally murdered.

04:51.685 --> 04:53.651
Hot, hot film at 11:00.

05:08.035 --> 05:13.205
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

05:13.240 --> 05:16.742
Aaaaaaah!

05:16.777 --> 05:18.744
What do you want?!

05:20.914 --> 05:22.548
Well?!

05:24.651 --> 05:27.552
Do... do you want something?

05:27.621 --> 05:29.287
Anything?

05:31.390 --> 05:35.358
Well, I have to get up early, so...

05:35.427 --> 05:37.994
So... Good night.

05:38.030 --> 05:38.995
Oh, what?

05:39.030 --> 05:40.997
Like we all have to be assholes?

05:45.003 --> 05:48.371
You will pay for cobra!

05:48.406 --> 05:52.608
Or you can choose from third-party
health-insurance plans, both PPOs and HMOs.

05:52.643 --> 05:54.610
Cobra!

05:57.649 --> 06:00.149
Beware, Gotham City.

06:00.185 --> 06:03.686
Nothing can stop the Joker!

06:28.978 --> 06:29.411
No!

06:29.447 --> 06:31.080
One more punch would kill you.

06:31.115 --> 06:32.248
And I won't kill you.

06:32.283 --> 06:34.250
That somehow means I win.

06:34.318 --> 06:38.621
I go to jail, escape, kill people,
go to jail, rinse and repeat.

06:38.657 --> 06:39.856
Yes, it's an endless cycle.

06:39.891 --> 06:42.892
But I've sworn to let the
courts do their work.

06:42.927 --> 06:44.426
What to do?

06:44.462 --> 06:46.595
Hmmmmmmmmmm.

06:46.664 --> 06:49.064
And due to the persuasive
testimony of the Batman...

06:49.099 --> 06:52.133
Thank you, Batman... The court has
decided upon the death penalty.

06:52.202 --> 06:54.602
It's, uh... It's out of my hands.

06:54.638 --> 07:00.107
Maurice P. Joker, for 2,391
counts of murder and many other

07:00.142 --> 07:03.610
crimes that seem minor next to
2,391 counts of murder, you have

07:03.679 --> 07:05.412
been sentenced to death.

07:05.481 --> 07:07.247
Have you any last words?

07:07.316 --> 07:10.484
I know Jesus has forgiven me.

07:10.519 --> 07:11.685
Is that a joke?

07:12.588 --> 07:13.320
No!

07:13.356 --> 07:14.356
Here we go!

07:17.693 --> 07:19.226
That's not right.

07:24.600 --> 07:25.766
Keep going until he's dead.

07:25.835 --> 07:28.769
It would be monstrous to stop now.

07:28.805 --> 07:31.471
you, Dork Knight!

07:39.883 --> 07:41.315
D'oh! Oh! Uh-oh!

07:44.320 --> 07:45.486
Aaaaaah!

07:47.057 --> 07:48.489
Oh, I-I-I didn't know.

07:48.558 --> 07:51.025
I- I... didn't know.

07:51.093 --> 07:53.460
Wait.

07:53.496 --> 07:55.129
But why?

07:55.197 --> 07:57.564
For Barbara.

08:01.737 --> 08:02.035
Huh?

08:02.104 --> 08:02.536
Aaaaah!

08:05.607 --> 08:06.739
"Eeeeee!"

08:06.808 --> 08:08.474
Go, Gordon! Go, Gordon!

08:08.509 --> 08:11.843
This is Hal Lexington for the
8:00 news, saying have a great

08:11.912 --> 08:13.378
night, and you, dad.

08:13.413 --> 08:15.080
you.

08:15.115 --> 08:16.114
Oh, computer!

08:16.149 --> 08:18.349
Your real name should
be "Porn Funnel. "

08:18.384 --> 08:21.285
I love my family more than
you, but only collectively.

08:21.320 --> 08:24.921
On a case-by-case basis, I love
you more than any...

08:24.956 --> 08:27.457
...Individual family member.

08:27.526 --> 08:29.459
It's true.

08:35.866 --> 08:37.000
Oh, my gosh.

08:37.068 --> 08:39.068
I'm inside the computer!

08:39.104 --> 08:41.239
We must fight the
master-control program.

08:42.008 --> 08:42.273
Wow!

08:42.342 --> 08:44.609
You're the topless girl
from "Caddyshack"!

08:44.644 --> 08:45.443
I am Yori.

08:45.479 --> 08:46.912
You're Lacey Underall!

08:47.714 --> 08:49.181
Underalls are stockings.

08:49.216 --> 08:50.816
Good pun, Mr. Ramis.

08:54.755 --> 08:55.255
Dang it!

08:55.290 --> 08:56.056
You fool!

08:56.091 --> 08:59.092
In my real life, I'm a computer
programmer, so I have a <i>huge</i>

08:59.161 --> 09:00.794
<i>advantage here. </i>

09:00.829 --> 09:04.964
<i>But you throw a frisbee like a
computer programmer, so that's</i>

09:05.000 --> 09:05.698
<i>not great. </i>

09:05.733 --> 09:09.902
<i>We lost our frisbees!</i>

09:09.971 --> 09:12.170
<i>Oh, does that mean we tied?</i>

09:15.774 --> 09:17.241
<i>Cool! A glow stick!</i>

09:17.277 --> 09:19.443
<i>We can pretend we're at a rave!</i>

09:22.315 --> 09:23.047
<i>Hey, ladies. </i>

09:24.251 --> 09:25.417
<i>Let's drink some shots!</i>

09:25.452 --> 09:28.153
<i>Ugh. Please shut up. </i>

09:28.189 --> 09:30.422
<i>Oh, my gosh! Light cycles!</i>

09:30.458 --> 09:32.392
<i>Yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

09:32.427 --> 09:33.627
<i>It's true! It's true!</i>

09:33.695 --> 09:38.032
You really <i>can</i> pee your pants
and have an erection at the same time!

09:38.067 --> 09:38.866
Look at me!

09:38.901 --> 09:41.169
I'm the opening
credits to "Frasier. "

09:41.237 --> 09:44.205
# Scrambled eggs #

09:44.240 --> 09:45.706
You're screwed now, nerd!

09:45.742 --> 09:47.208
Our light cycles <i>never</i> crash!

09:47.243 --> 09:48.042
Oh, really?

09:48.077 --> 09:50.144
Try installing third-party
software of any kind.

09:50.180 --> 09:51.946
I'm downloading
shareware right now.

09:51.982 --> 09:53.248
Aaaaaaagh!

09:56.753 --> 09:58.686
Goodbye, evil staple remover!

09:58.722 --> 09:59.387
Whoa!

09:59.422 --> 10:01.589
The master-control program!

10:01.624 --> 10:03.325
Behold, outsider.

10:03.360 --> 10:05.293
Behold how high-tech I am.

10:05.329 --> 10:07.663
Uh, well, I guess.

10:07.698 --> 10:13.102
I mean... Why, it would take nothing
short of ping-pong balls to defeat me!

10:13.872 --> 10:17.841
Oh, yeah, I forgot how much
this part of the game sucked.

10:18.811 --> 10:19.843
Oh, no!

10:19.879 --> 10:21.879
Are you some kind of God?

10:21.914 --> 10:22.647
I guess.

10:22.682 --> 10:25.216
Computers will <i>still</i>
rule humans one day.

10:25.285 --> 10:28.953
Or, at the very least, computers will
<i>really</i> annoy humans one day.

10:29.022 --> 10:31.489
Just you wait until that
annoying kid with the dandruff

10:31.525 --> 10:34.125
from high school finds you on
Facebook and bugs you to play

10:34.160 --> 10:36.828
knockoff scrabble twice a day,
and you'll kind of get hooked on

10:36.863 --> 10:39.464
it, and then a legal battle will
make them yank the game down,

10:39.499 --> 10:42.668
just when your scores were really
starting to kick ass, and then...

10:46.007 --> 10:46.939
You win.

10:47.008 --> 10:47.673
Yes!

10:47.708 --> 10:50.209
I am now the master
of all computers!

10:50.278 --> 10:52.312
Bring on the endless free porn!

10:52.347 --> 10:54.648
Your wish is my command.

10:55.618 --> 10:59.220
Oh, yeah, I forgot... It's 1982.

10:59.289 --> 11:02.857
So, Lacey Underall, I don't suppose you
want to play strip poker for realsies?

11:04.326 --> 11:05.493
# Ba-bawk bawk bawk #
