WEBVTT

00:02.127 --> 00:05.301
Here 's a couple things you might
need to know or maybe just forgot.

00:05.464 --> 00:08.263
Why'd you bring us here?
-I need you to do a job for me.

00:08.425 --> 00:11.178
We've been tracking a computer
super-virus named the Omen.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.143
Bring it back to me, Casey goes free.

00:13.305 --> 00:17.435
The virus is too dangerous to be released
to the world. It could wipe out everything.

00:17.601 --> 00:20.821
What do you plan to do with it?
-What do you plan to do with it, John?

00:20.979 --> 00:23.607
You're gonna break me
out of here alone?

00:24.608 --> 00:26.610
Prisoner transfer, Section 38.

00:26.777 --> 00:31.123
-Give me one reason not to kill you.
-it'll only further prove your guilt.

00:31.281 --> 00:34.034
Let's go right now.
-Hey, Decker, you forgetting something?

00:39.540 --> 00:43.465
So, Verbanski blew up Decker.
That was pretty messed up.

00:43.627 --> 00:46.801
Now the CIA wants to frame me
for something awful. That's bad too.

00:46.964 --> 00:49.467
But there is something else
going on here.

00:49.633 --> 00:53.012
Something personal.
Who's after us, Sarah?

00:53.178 --> 00:56.227
I don't know. We'll get the team together
and figure this out.

00:56.390 --> 00:59.690
They were supposed to be here
an hour ago. Did they get caught?

00:59.851 --> 01:04.652
You wanna explain to me
what I'm doing in the ducts of Castle?

01:04.815 --> 01:06.738
This is our Castle, our secret base.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.073
Maybe my plan was
a bit overly cautious, okay?

01:09.278 --> 01:11.155
But Verbanski
was very complimentary of it.

01:11.321 --> 01:14.996
-Egh. Should have gone in the front door.
-Whoa, you're a fugitive, okay?

01:15.158 --> 01:18.503
There's a mysterious CIA plot to destroy
you, Chuck and Sarah. Perhaps even me.

01:18.662 --> 01:21.256
Agh, keep your ego in check,
will you, Grimes?

01:21.415 --> 01:23.884
Okay. What if, though?

01:24.042 --> 01:27.216
-What if Castle's been compromised?
-That's....

01:28.171 --> 01:29.514
Actually a very fine point.

01:31.550 --> 01:33.723
Good job on the breakout.
That was actually--

01:33.885 --> 01:35.683
I'm proud of you, moron.

01:36.013 --> 01:38.857
Did you just compliment me
and insult me?

01:40.892 --> 01:42.018
We're here.

01:42.185 --> 01:45.314
Chuck, hey. Stand back.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.703
Sorry we're late.

01:51.862 --> 01:55.082
Someone needed a sandwich.
Then someone needed a fruit cup, so....

01:56.074 --> 01:58.748
Well, we're just happy
that you're back.

01:58.910 --> 02:02.005
-Where's Verbanski?
-Well, since she disposed of Decker...

02:02.164 --> 02:04.883
...she felt it best to stay out
of the country till things die down.

02:05.042 --> 02:07.545
Just when things were getting going
between you two.

02:07.711 --> 02:10.055
So painful. I mean, that hurts.
Man, it's tough.

02:10.631 --> 02:13.555
-I just said what I was thinking out loud.
-I'm sorry, Casey.

02:13.717 --> 02:15.890
Yeah, she was a hell of a woman.

02:17.721 --> 02:20.975
Still is. She's not dead and neither am I.
Let's get on with it.

02:21.224 --> 02:24.899
Right. Well, before Decker blew up,
he was after this, the Omen...

02:25.062 --> 02:29.238
...a computer virus that can erase
100 zettabytes of data per second.

02:29.399 --> 02:32.824
Whoa, 100 zettabytes?
Is that a real thing?

02:32.986 --> 02:35.284
It could take down the Internet,
crash planes...

02:35.447 --> 02:37.950
...and erase every database in the world.
Yeah, it's real.

02:38.116 --> 02:42.166
If the people trying to frame Chuck are
inside the CIA, we need to find Beckman.

02:42.496 --> 02:45.340
Or she can find you.

02:45.499 --> 02:49.299
This is an official communiquÃ©Â©.
I requested to tell you myself

02:49.461 --> 02:51.088
For the murder of Agent Decker...

02:51.254 --> 02:54.474
...as well as the crime of treason
against the United States...

02:54.633 --> 02:57.432
...the CIA is placing all of you
under arrest.

02:57.594 --> 03:01.519
-What? General, how can you do this?
I'd ask your team the same.

03:01.682 --> 03:05.983
If you know what's good for you,
you'll stay put. Agents are on the way.

03:06.144 --> 03:10.490
I put my trust in you for years
and look what you've become: traitors.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.776
Gen-- How could she--?

03:12.943 --> 03:15.412
Even Beckman's against us?
How did this happen?

03:17.197 --> 03:18.619
You clever dame.

03:19.991 --> 03:22.414
What are you doing?
-She's amazing.

03:22.828 --> 03:24.205
What are you talking about?

03:24.413 --> 03:27.963
Look, Morse code. She was giving us
a warning, telling us to run.

03:28.125 --> 03:30.844
We have exactly five minutes
before the CIA charges in.

03:31.002 --> 03:33.676
-What? She said all that?
-We need to get out of here.

03:33.839 --> 03:38.140
Let's get to my father's cabin and access
the CIA database using his Orion system.

03:38.301 --> 03:40.474
-Find out who's after us.
I'll find Beckman.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.560
Let you know
when I found something.

03:42.723 --> 03:46.318
Look, I know we've been chased before,
but I got a bad feeling about this.

03:46.476 --> 03:47.853
It's like we're being hunted.

03:48.019 --> 03:50.363
-Chuck, it's okay. We can handle it.
Damn right.

03:50.522 --> 03:53.651
But if we are, I need to get
to the apartment, wipe my computer.

03:53.817 --> 03:57.321
Too dangerous. The complex
is probably surrounded by agents.

03:57.821 --> 03:59.539
Then I go.

03:59.698 --> 04:03.578
Makes sense. I'm not a fugitive.
They're not hunting me. I can do this.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.838
Okay, I'll show you what to do.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.170
You all right?

04:09.332 --> 04:12.006
-You ready to go?
-Yeah.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.558
Babe, you ready to go?

04:18.716 --> 04:21.345
Don't come in here.
I'm still getting ready.

04:29.060 --> 04:30.186
Babe?

04:40.489 --> 04:43.117
Okay, ready.

04:45.368 --> 04:46.620
Wow.

04:47.037 --> 04:49.540
Heh, it is so awesome
that you're my wife.

04:50.081 --> 04:53.961
Thank you. Honey, are you sure
Clara's gonna be okay?

04:54.127 --> 04:56.880
Babe, Clara's fine.
She's with my parents.

04:57.047 --> 05:00.722
This is what we wanted, remember?
Fancy dinner, nice hotel.

05:00.884 --> 05:02.886
Mini vacay.

05:04.054 --> 05:07.228
Right. Been way too long since
we've had time just the two of us.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.734
It's gonna be a great night, I promise.

05:09.935 --> 05:12.313
And I have a little surprise for you.

05:12.479 --> 05:13.856
Mm.

05:14.022 --> 05:17.322
I might have a little surprise
for you too.

05:43.301 --> 05:45.770
One more move and I will end you.

05:45.929 --> 05:48.182
Damn it.
And I was trying to be discreet.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.440
-Man.
-Morgan?

05:49.975 --> 05:51.818
-Yeah, yeah, it's me.
-Morgan.

05:51.977 --> 05:54.947
What are you doing
breaking into your own apartment?

05:55.313 --> 05:57.486
Doing a favor for your dad.

05:57.649 --> 06:00.528
And not trying to be seen, but, heh....

06:00.694 --> 06:03.493
We broke him out of jail.
The CIA's sort of hunting him.

06:03.655 --> 06:07.626
I know. The authorities contacted me.
I just thought maybe he would be here.

06:08.285 --> 06:10.287
No, the whole team's on the lam.

06:10.453 --> 06:14.378
He's not coming back here.
Not for a while, anyway. But, uh, okay.

06:16.126 --> 06:19.130
How have you been?
Are you all right?

06:21.339 --> 06:22.511
Go, I got it.

06:28.096 --> 06:29.518
Okay.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.567
Please. Whoa, yeah, sure.

06:32.726 --> 06:36.981
I mean, you could at least wipe your feet
before you come traipsing through here.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.496
Robyn Cunnings. Special agent, CIA.

06:48.658 --> 06:51.502
I'm looking for John Casey
and the rest of your team.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.163
Where are they?

06:53.330 --> 06:54.832
I don't know.

06:54.998 --> 06:58.218
Technically I'm not part
of the spy team anymore, so I--

07:00.337 --> 07:02.339
What are you two doing here, anyway?

07:02.505 --> 07:06.510
He's my boyfriend. You know,
we're just hanging out at the apartment.

07:06.676 --> 07:09.179
The apartment that I live in.
Yeah, with her father.

07:10.221 --> 07:14.772
-You live with your girlfriend's father?
-Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

07:14.935 --> 07:20.192
Seems a little awkward, sure,
but it works, you know, for us.

07:21.650 --> 07:24.369
-It's clear. He's not here.
-See? We told you.

07:24.527 --> 07:26.074
We don't know where my dad is.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.575
But I want him safe. He's a good man.

07:33.078 --> 07:35.706
Good men don't go on the run.

07:35.872 --> 07:40.878
If you see him or help him,
you'll be aiding and abetting a fugitive.

07:41.544 --> 07:44.297
Enjoy the rest of your evening.
We'll be right outside.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.598
Nice. That was good. You all right?

07:53.765 --> 07:56.894
-Yeah.
-You did great. It was perfect.

07:57.060 --> 07:59.734
-I'm your boyfriend, huh?
-Ugh, that was a lie, Morgan.

07:59.896 --> 08:01.739
Don't get so excited.

08:03.566 --> 08:04.909
Not that excited.

08:06.236 --> 08:10.082
I know we'll fix this, but do you think
they'll bring Ellie in for questioning?

08:10.240 --> 08:12.083
-Man, I wish I could call her.
-I know.

08:12.242 --> 08:15.667
But they could've tapped her phone
and we don't want her implicated.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.752
Right, right, right.

08:19.082 --> 08:22.427
We're not staying at this cabin, right?
This thing's gonna blow over.

08:22.585 --> 08:26.135
-I'm not disappearing on my sister, am I?
-No, why would you say that?

08:26.297 --> 08:29.016
Us wanted by the CIA, my family history.
I'm just saying.

08:29.217 --> 08:31.094
We won't disappear like your parents.

08:31.261 --> 08:34.640
We're just hiding out for a little while.
Everyone's gonna be fine.

08:40.270 --> 08:43.649
Reservation for two under Woodcomb.

08:43.815 --> 08:46.864
I'm sorry, I don't have
a reservation under that name.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.621
Oh, you know what?
Check "Bartowski."

08:53.742 --> 08:57.337
Boss, we've got a lock
on the Bartowskis.

08:57.495 --> 09:01.250
Excellent. Let's get on it, then.

09:03.334 --> 09:06.053
I used Chuck's Open Table account.
He loves the points.

09:06.254 --> 09:10.384
Here we are. Table for two.
Mr. and Mrs. Bartowski, right this way.

09:54.511 --> 09:57.310
-To a very special night.
-And a few little surprises.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.350
Babe, you look beautiful.

10:00.725 --> 10:01.772
Thank you.

10:01.935 --> 10:05.860
I, uh, wanted something a little different,
so I borrowed a dress from Sarah.

10:06.022 --> 10:08.901
She wore it on a mission
in Bulgaria once. How wild is that?

10:10.235 --> 10:14.035
Ever wonder what it would be like if we
lived a life of mystery and adventure?

10:14.197 --> 10:16.825
-Like Chuck and Sarah?
-Like spies.

10:19.953 --> 10:23.958
Well, you know,
spy work does run in our family.

10:24.124 --> 10:29.255
There's no reason why you and I
can't pretend to be spies for tonight.

10:32.632 --> 10:36.978
Man, I'm glad we're not on the I am
forever, because I gotta tell you...

10:37.137 --> 10:40.892
...standing here, I'm feeling a little bit
like I'm becoming my father.

10:41.891 --> 10:45.236
I imagine this is what he felt like
the first day he had to leave us.

10:45.395 --> 10:47.238
-All alone in exile.
-That won't happen.

10:47.397 --> 10:53.075
-Not if I've got anything to do with it.
-It's like my family's thing or something.

10:53.236 --> 10:55.455
-The Bartowski Curse.
-The what?

10:55.613 --> 10:58.662
Every Bartowski
has put their family in danger...

10:58.867 --> 11:02.292
...then had to leave them
in order to protect them, and I'm next.

11:02.453 --> 11:05.127
Look, there is no such thing
as the Bartowski Curse.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.793
You're not gonna be like
your father. You know why?

11:07.959 --> 11:11.463
Because you've got me.
You're not alone.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.182
Access granted.

11:16.176 --> 11:20.977
Okay, okay. It worked.
We're in the CIA's mainframe.

11:21.139 --> 11:24.939
Okay, let's figure out
who Decker was working for.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.774
Who's behind this.

11:27.604 --> 11:30.608
There's an active case file,
but no lead agent listed.

11:30.773 --> 11:34.653
Not even the CIA knows who's in charge.
It's a dead end.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.330
So we're gonna be spies?

11:37.488 --> 11:40.492
What do you say, Six Pack,
are you in?

11:40.658 --> 11:42.205
Well, all right, Hot Mama.

11:42.410 --> 11:46.165
Maybe we should come up with
a code word in case things get too hot.

11:47.916 --> 11:48.963
How about "martini"?

11:49.792 --> 11:52.215
And we can communicate
with hand gestures.

11:52.420 --> 11:54.639
When we need to send a signal
to one another...

11:54.797 --> 11:58.142
...we can just tug on our ear like so.

11:58.301 --> 12:00.178
Babe, you look so cool
when you do that.

12:01.304 --> 12:02.977
May I take these plates?

12:03.139 --> 12:07.019
Well, if you'll excuse me,
it's time to bring out your surprise.

12:16.027 --> 12:17.495
Copy that.

12:18.321 --> 12:19.538
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

12:22.325 --> 12:24.919
-They have an ID on the target.
-It says they found us.

12:25.078 --> 12:28.833
They're closing in. Gotta get out of here.
We have to run, for real this time.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.718
Sarah, this is exactly what
I was afraid of.

12:31.876 --> 12:34.129
I'm sorry.
I know that you're not ready for this.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.514
Nobody's ever ready
for something like this. We gotta go.

12:36.673 --> 12:39.176
-Well, how long are we talking here?
-I don't know.

12:39.342 --> 12:42.687
But this has nothing to do
with your parents. It has to do with us.

12:42.845 --> 12:45.018
Trust me.
I've been on the run my entire life.

12:45.181 --> 12:48.856
And the only way this is gonna work
is if we stick together, okay?

12:49.102 --> 12:52.231
Okay, okay, fine, but there's one thing
I can't leave without.

12:52.397 --> 12:54.525
-What?
-My P.A.N.T.S.

12:54.691 --> 12:56.534
Your pants?

12:57.610 --> 12:59.612
You got it.
I will get you your P.A.N.T.S.

12:59.779 --> 13:03.534
It would be an honor.
Hey, listen. I love you, man.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.751
Chuck's going on the run
and needs pants?

13:05.910 --> 13:08.413
Well, they're his secret P.A.N.T.S.

13:08.579 --> 13:10.752
You know what?
It's best I just show you mine.

13:11.207 --> 13:15.053
Watch your hand. Ready?
Okay, here you go.

13:16.587 --> 13:18.009
What's so special about them?

13:18.172 --> 13:21.051
Oh, not so fast. Not so fast.

13:21.217 --> 13:24.221
Since we were kids,
Chuck and I each had a box of P.A.N.T.S.

13:24.387 --> 13:26.060
Private Artifacts Never to Share.

13:26.222 --> 13:29.317
We kind of went through
an acronym phase. You know. Anyways.

13:29.517 --> 13:31.986
This is where we kept
our most sacred possessions.

13:32.145 --> 13:35.490
-In case of a fire, this is what we save.
-And you both have these?

13:35.648 --> 13:37.742
Well, you know,
Chuck's generally neurotic.

13:37.900 --> 13:40.403
And I was just terrified
of my house burning down...

13:40.570 --> 13:42.538
...since, you know,
my house burned down.

13:44.907 --> 13:48.127
Here we go, 2000 Sangiovese.

13:48.619 --> 13:52.123
Little surprise for the wife.
Same bottle we had at our wedding.

13:52.290 --> 13:55.920
-She is gonna love it.
-I'm thrilled for you, really.

13:58.755 --> 14:00.348
Perfect.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.640
You okay, bro?

14:04.802 --> 14:09.273
Project Eagle is in effect. I'm here to take
you and your wife to a secret location.

14:09.432 --> 14:10.775
We should leave quickly.

14:17.482 --> 14:19.610
Project Eagle?

14:19.776 --> 14:23.701
Your limo's just outside.
I'll be waiting there for you and your wife.

14:24.280 --> 14:29.332
My wife. Project Eagle, mm? Right. Heh.

14:29.494 --> 14:31.622
Be right there.

14:47.178 --> 14:49.226
Are we surrounded?
Are there too many guys?

14:49.389 --> 14:52.063
No, that's just it.
There's nobody out there.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.648
-Could they have made a mistake?
-They must have.

14:59.690 --> 15:02.534
-What's the matter?
-Nothing. Just kind of weird.

15:02.693 --> 15:07.574
It's a reminder from Open Table to review
my dining experience from tonight.

15:07.740 --> 15:11.370
-Ellie must have used your account.
-She always does. I love the points!

15:11.536 --> 15:14.210
That means the operatives think
that Ellie and Devon....

15:14.372 --> 15:15.999
Are us.

15:23.131 --> 15:24.508
-Oh.
-Aw, come on, babe...

15:24.674 --> 15:26.017
...you're harshing on my spy vibe.

15:26.175 --> 15:29.349
I'm sorry, I thought it was off.
There. Done.

15:30.430 --> 15:33.354
-Straight to voice mail again.
-No answer from Devon either.

15:33.516 --> 15:37.521
Oh, God. Sarah,
I think Ellie and Awesome were taken.

15:41.524 --> 15:43.618
-Honey, this is--
-Exactly what we needed.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.153
Yes.

16:04.714 --> 16:09.766
All my ex's live in Texas

16:11.053 --> 16:16.560
And Texas is the place
I'd dearly love to be

16:18.436 --> 16:20.939
Took you long enough to find me.

16:21.105 --> 16:23.483
This is where we come
in our darkest hours.

16:23.691 --> 16:28.492
Iran-Contra, Nicaragua.
The Clinton years.

16:28.738 --> 16:32.208
A group inside the CIA
is conspiring to destroy Chuck.

16:33.743 --> 16:36.667
-Who's behind it?
-I don't know.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.298
I need one of the conspirators.
In the meantime...

16:39.457 --> 16:42.586
...I'm doing everything I can
to help Chuck and Sarah from here.

16:42.752 --> 16:44.595
But they're being hunted as we speak.

16:46.255 --> 16:48.257
And so is their family.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.976
Ha!
This is totally great.

16:51.719 --> 16:54.939
God, this car is so rad, babe. Ha, ha.

16:55.097 --> 16:59.273
-Where we going, anyway?
-Well, I don't know, Sixer. You tell me.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.860
You, uh-- You sure your driver
has his livery license?

17:04.022 --> 17:06.867
-My driver? This is your surprise.
-My surprise?

17:07.026 --> 17:09.779
My surprise was a bottle of Sangiovese
at the restaurant.

17:09.945 --> 17:12.494
Are you telling me
neither one of us booked this car?

17:12.656 --> 17:14.829
Must be some mistake.
We'll just talk to him.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.962
-No, no, no, don't do that.
-What? Why?

17:18.119 --> 17:21.464
Project Eagle, the limo. What if
we open that thing and he shoots us?

17:21.624 --> 17:24.298
-I've seen it in the movies.
-Ha, ha--

17:25.127 --> 17:28.973
Babe,
what if we're on a real spy mission?

17:34.887 --> 17:36.764
-Martini!
-Martini!

17:41.978 --> 17:45.482
Please, tell me you're not about
to do something foolish.

17:45.982 --> 17:49.737
Me, foolish? No. Just preparing the gear
I need to get Chuck's P.A.N.T.S...

17:49.902 --> 17:53.497
...without being seen by those large
scary agents waiting outside for us.

17:53.990 --> 17:56.664
And how exactly are you planning
on doing that?

17:57.159 --> 18:00.003
That's easy. Hop out the side window.
Climb onto the roof.

18:00.162 --> 18:03.257
Shoot a cord to Chuck's.
Zip-line across. Sneak into the patio.

18:03.416 --> 18:06.386
Grab Chuck's P.A.N.T.S.
In and out, never even being seen.

18:06.544 --> 18:07.716
Easy. At least it was...

18:07.878 --> 18:10.848
-...when I had a computer in my brain.
-That is crazy.

18:11.299 --> 18:14.098
Not only are you gonna get caught,
but you'll probably break your neck.

18:14.260 --> 18:18.356
Oh, thanks. Look.

18:18.514 --> 18:21.017
I know I was a jerk
and I know that you're mad at me.

18:21.183 --> 18:25.859
And I deserve that, okay?
I've made many, many poor decisions.

18:26.022 --> 18:30.698
This is not one of them, okay?
I have to help my friend.

18:34.196 --> 18:37.075
Morgan, wait. I have a better idea.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.553
Hi. Yes, um,
I'd like to report an emergency.

18:49.712 --> 18:52.261
Yeah, my crazy ex-boyfriend
is outside my house.

18:52.423 --> 18:54.846
I think he might do something
really dangerous.

18:55.217 --> 18:57.140
Yeah, that's right.

18:57.345 --> 19:02.567
Okay, he's 6 feet tall and he has
blond hair and he's wearing a black suit.

19:02.725 --> 19:06.070
Could you hurry, please?
Because I'm really, really scared.

19:06.228 --> 19:07.275
Thank you.

19:07.438 --> 19:10.408
There. Okay,
so as soon as you hear the sirens, just go.

19:10.566 --> 19:14.241
-I think I bought you about 10 minutes.
-That was...

19:14.403 --> 19:15.746
...diabolical.

19:18.783 --> 19:21.411
Honey, we have to form a plan.
-Babe, deep breath.

19:21.577 --> 19:23.250
It's gonna be okay. I have an idea.

19:23.412 --> 19:25.585
-Okay, I'm listening.
-All right.

19:26.248 --> 19:28.376
We need to dive out of the car.
We'll be fine.

19:28.542 --> 19:31.091
-All we need is a sturdy combat roll.
-Ah, I can't do it.

19:31.253 --> 19:34.177
Of course you can.
You have done way harder things.

19:34.382 --> 19:37.431
-We need to just open the door, roll out.
-You don't understand.

19:37.593 --> 19:39.766
I went to Agent Provocateur
and got an outfit.

19:39.929 --> 19:42.603
The panties were optional
and I didn't opt to wear them.

19:43.432 --> 19:46.606
-Really?
-Surprise.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.485
Whoa.

19:51.107 --> 19:53.781
Casey. Casey, finally.

19:53.943 --> 19:56.446
We got big problems.
Ellie and Awesome were abducted.

19:56.821 --> 19:58.789
-Yeah, I know.
-You know?

19:58.948 --> 20:01.451
Yeah.
They were taken by Beckman's men.

20:01.617 --> 20:04.291
-Don't worry. She's helping us.
-Oh, thank God.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.836
We have to get her agent
on the phone, okay?

20:07.998 --> 20:11.502
Ellie and Awesome are probably
freaking out. I'll meet up with the car...

20:11.669 --> 20:13.922
-...bring them to Beckman myself
-Roger that.

20:17.675 --> 20:19.143
Yes, general?

20:19.468 --> 20:22.312
-What kind of lingerie was it again?
-Devon, concentrate!

20:22.471 --> 20:25.475
Okay. Babe, babe,
the car is slowing down. We can do this.

20:25.641 --> 20:29.066
Just like Chuck and Sarah.
Tuck and roll. Okay, ready?

20:29.228 --> 20:31.026
Ready. No peeking.

20:32.565 --> 20:36.240
One, two, three!

20:46.829 --> 20:49.252
-Babe, babe, are you okay?
-Yeah, yeah.

20:49.457 --> 20:51.334
We gotta get out of here.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.017
General, we may have a problem.

21:04.180 --> 21:06.558
See? They're safe with Beckman's men.

21:06.724 --> 21:08.692
We have nothing to worry about.

21:10.519 --> 21:13.272
I'll track them down
and I'll call you back.

21:13.981 --> 21:16.359
Looks like you lost your passengers.

21:16.525 --> 21:18.277
Robyn, what are you doing here?

21:19.612 --> 21:21.580
Oh, Simms.

21:26.994 --> 21:29.998
-I think we lost him.
-Yeah, for now.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.875
Oh, God!

21:35.920 --> 21:37.547
Mr. and Mrs. Bartowski.

21:39.548 --> 21:43.394
No, there's a mistake, okay?
We're the Woodcombs.

21:44.929 --> 21:47.057
Chuck's my brother, though.
Who are you?

21:47.223 --> 21:50.568
Robyn Cunnings, special agent
with the CIA. Somebody's after you.

21:50.726 --> 21:54.230
-Don't worry. I work with your brother.
-You work with Chuck? Where's Chuck?

21:54.396 --> 21:57.275
He's on his way, but I was closer,
so he sent me to get you.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.903
Please, you have to come
with us immediately.

22:01.278 --> 22:02.780
I'm here to help.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.583
Okay, let's go.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.918
Oh, no, is that...?

22:16.919 --> 22:19.923
Sarah, where are they?

22:21.757 --> 22:23.100
Thank you.

22:23.968 --> 22:26.812
No, thank you, Mr. Woodcomb.

22:33.477 --> 22:36.276
It's now or never, Morgan.
Move like the wind.

23:01.672 --> 23:03.549
The coded message
was from Decker's men.

23:03.716 --> 23:06.720
They were following Ellie and Awesome,
mistaking them for us.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.638
They shot Simms to cover their tracks.

23:08.804 --> 23:11.148
We have to find whoever is in charge
and stop this.

23:11.307 --> 23:15.312
If they think Ellie and Awesome know
about the Omen, they'll torture them.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.863
Why are we sitting here?
What's the plan?

23:18.022 --> 23:20.571
I'm sorry, Chuck, but for now, we wait.

23:20.733 --> 23:23.327
-They'll call to set up a meet.
-How can we just wait?

23:23.485 --> 23:27.740
Ellie and Awesome are probably having
their fingernails ripped out as we speak.

23:35.497 --> 23:38.421
Babe, it's like a real masseuse.

23:38.626 --> 23:41.505
I can literally feel her fingers
on my spine.

23:41.670 --> 23:44.844
Or his or whoever's, but you know.

23:45.341 --> 23:49.391
-Gotta get one of these in the living room.
-Sounds great.

23:51.639 --> 23:55.189
Mr. and Mrs. Woodcomb, again,
I'm so sorry for the inconvenience.

23:55.351 --> 23:57.069
Your brother will pick you up soon.

23:57.227 --> 23:59.696
In the meantime,
I hope these accommodations suffice.

23:59.855 --> 24:02.654
We reserve this room
only for the most regarded of spies.

24:03.233 --> 24:07.113
Can I offer you anything to drink?
A soda pop? Some water, perhaps?

24:07.279 --> 24:09.031
Actually, we were on a date tonight.

24:09.198 --> 24:11.872
So some wine, if possible.

24:12.284 --> 24:13.536
Sangiovese, perhaps?

24:16.538 --> 24:18.461
It would be my pleasure.

24:18.666 --> 24:20.964
Bring that insufferable woman
a bottle of wine...

24:21.168 --> 24:23.671
...and get me Chuck Bartowski
on the phone.

24:31.595 --> 24:33.597
Oh. Ellie, thank God.

24:33.764 --> 24:36.734
Lovely sister you have.
Husband's not so bad, either.

24:37.393 --> 24:39.566
Can't say I'm fond of them
long-term, though.

24:39.728 --> 24:43.358
I don't know who the hell you are, but if
you touch one hair on my sister's head--

24:43.524 --> 24:45.652
Come on, Chuck. Spare us both.

24:45.818 --> 24:48.071
They're comfortable for now
and I prefer it stay that way.

24:48.237 --> 24:52.117
But if things get complicated,
I can't guarantee their safety.

24:53.075 --> 24:55.453
Let me tell you
how this is gonna work.

24:57.746 --> 24:58.838
What'd they say?

25:01.083 --> 25:03.256
We have three hours
to deliver the Omen...

25:04.837 --> 25:06.839
...or they kill Ellie and Awesome.

25:08.465 --> 25:09.933
Mm.

25:10.092 --> 25:13.346
-They're bluffing.
-We need to start making a fake to deliver.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.355
What if they figure out it's a fake?

25:15.931 --> 25:18.810
I know you're scared,
but we just can't hand over a weapon.

25:18.976 --> 25:21.604
It's bigger than us, Bartowski.
It's national security.

25:21.770 --> 25:23.772
I promise we will take
every precaution.

25:23.939 --> 25:27.489
I will not let them do anything
to your sister.

25:30.112 --> 25:32.490
You guys are the pros.
You know what you're doing.

25:33.532 --> 25:36.957
So let's go with the fake.

25:47.337 --> 25:48.964
Hey.

25:49.256 --> 25:51.509
Look, I know you're concerned.
Talk to me.

25:51.675 --> 25:54.554
I'm scared. This is a mistake.
This whole plan is a mistake.

25:54.762 --> 25:58.141
Giving them a fake virus is a mistake.
Ellie and Awesome are in danger.

25:58.307 --> 26:01.982
We need to give them the real virus
to get them back. I have to do it alone.

26:02.144 --> 26:05.489
You don't have to do it alone.
There are people here who are with you.

26:05.647 --> 26:07.991
I'm with you,
and I happen to think you're right.

26:08.817 --> 26:12.822
This is my curse. Don't you understand?
People I love are in danger. It's my fault.

26:12.988 --> 26:14.740
-I need to fix it.
-Forget the curse.

26:14.907 --> 26:18.537
I'll go convince Casey and Beckman
that your plan is the right thing to do.

26:18.702 --> 26:19.874
Then we'll go together.

26:20.496 --> 26:23.090
You heard them. They're--
They'll never be on board with this.

26:23.540 --> 26:25.417
Trust me. I will talk to them.

26:26.376 --> 26:29.721
-And what if they say no?
-It's gonna take some time, okay?

26:33.884 --> 26:36.512
-Okay, fine. I'll wait right here.
-Okay.

26:47.940 --> 26:50.034
Honey, I can't find my phone.

26:50.192 --> 26:52.741
Probably just fell out
when we rolled out of the car.

26:52.903 --> 26:54.530
Yeah, you're probably right.

26:57.699 --> 27:00.043
I'm sorry, there was no Sangiovese.

27:00.202 --> 27:03.456
But, uh, I managed to rustle up
some Chardonnay.

27:04.123 --> 27:08.219
My apologies if it's not that good.
It's only 2009.

27:08.377 --> 27:11.381
No worries, bro. This'll be fine.

27:11.547 --> 27:14.266
Hardly. I forgot the ice.

27:14.424 --> 27:15.471
Oh.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.602
But we did find this in the car.

27:18.387 --> 27:19.730
Oh, heh.

27:19.888 --> 27:21.561
Thank you.

27:27.229 --> 27:29.823
See, babe?
All's well that ends well, huh?

27:29.982 --> 27:31.450
Right. Heh.

27:31.942 --> 27:34.240
-Anyway, I'll go get the ice.
Okay.

27:37.281 --> 27:39.750
-What the hell are you doing?
-They're gonna kill us.

27:40.450 --> 27:42.248
What? He just brought us wine.

27:42.411 --> 27:45.836
No, I've been in this situation before.
The CIA doesn't bring you wine.

27:45.998 --> 27:48.421
They stole my phone
and they called Chuck with it.

27:48.584 --> 27:51.804
So it's clearly some
sort of ransom situation.

27:51.962 --> 27:54.590
I don't know-- We gotta find another way
to get out of here.

27:56.466 --> 27:58.184
I think we're making a mistake.

27:58.385 --> 28:01.639
Ellie and Awesome are not spies.
They're civilians.

28:01.805 --> 28:05.309
We know what this group is capable of.
Fake could put them over the edge.

28:05.475 --> 28:08.445
They're savages.
Reckless and single-minded.

28:08.604 --> 28:10.447
I think we need to support Chuck.

28:10.606 --> 28:12.529
This is his family
and it's my family too now...

28:12.691 --> 28:15.695
...and we need to do everything
we can to protect them.

28:16.945 --> 28:18.947
Let's get the Omen and find Chuck.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.512
Boss, I think you need to look at this.

28:36.506 --> 28:39.350
Hi, there. It's me, Chuck Bartowski.

28:40.928 --> 28:42.726
From the phone call?

28:42.930 --> 28:44.307
Right on time.

28:52.814 --> 28:55.488
Well, hand over the Omen.

28:55.651 --> 28:59.155
You didn't think I was actually dumb
enough to bring it with me, did you?

28:59.738 --> 29:01.331
It's hidden.

29:01.490 --> 29:04.664
Release my family
or you can spend the rest of your lives...

29:04.826 --> 29:06.749
...searching for a virus
you're never gonna find.

29:10.499 --> 29:12.001
Follow me.

29:16.505 --> 29:19.179
What the hell? How did this happen?

29:20.968 --> 29:23.016
I guess you've never met my sister.

29:27.516 --> 29:31.191
Upstairs clear.
No sign of the Woodcombs.

29:31.353 --> 29:35.199
Copy that.
Orders are shoot to kill on sight.

29:35.357 --> 29:38.361
-This is really hardcore.
-I told you.

29:40.737 --> 29:44.537
I'm not giving you anything until I know
my sister and her husband are safe.

29:44.741 --> 29:45.913
Ha!

29:46.076 --> 29:49.205
You're not exactly in a position
to bargain now, are you?

29:49.371 --> 29:51.373
There's something
I'm known for, Chuck.

29:52.416 --> 29:54.544
Some people call it torture.

29:54.710 --> 29:58.214
I like to think of it
as more of an art form.

30:00.382 --> 30:03.431
You're going to give me
exactly what I want.

30:04.386 --> 30:07.435
And I'm very, very good at this.

30:08.932 --> 30:12.436
Honey, Chuck came to save us.
-He's in trouble, babe.

30:12.602 --> 30:15.105
-We have to help him.
We can't just go down there.

30:15.272 --> 30:18.151
-We need a tactical advantage.
-Okay.

30:18.900 --> 30:20.902
I can handle anything
you throw at me.

30:21.737 --> 30:23.080
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

30:23.238 --> 30:24.615
They always say that.

30:26.241 --> 30:28.118
So sad.

30:28.744 --> 30:30.246
Bring out the Toy.

30:39.338 --> 30:42.308
Whoa, whoa, really? Really?
That's the Toy?

30:42.466 --> 30:46.061
I don't think children should be involved
with that device in any way, shape or form.

30:46.219 --> 30:47.971
Shh, Shh.

30:48.138 --> 30:50.982
Okay, all the lights are hooked up
to that electrical panel.

30:51.141 --> 30:54.771
If we can get that guard away, we can
short the circuits, cause a blackout.

30:54.936 --> 30:58.440
That's genius, babe.
Okay, okay, you cause a distraction.

30:58.607 --> 31:00.701
I'll blow the power
and I'll go grab Chuck.

31:01.610 --> 31:03.783
We can do this, honey. Like real spies.

31:03.945 --> 31:05.697
Babe, right now we are real spies.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.161
Do you ever cry, Chuck?

31:08.116 --> 31:10.665
Sometimes,
particularly during sports movies.

31:10.827 --> 31:13.626
Field of Dreams is just gut-wrenching,
but also uplifting.

31:13.789 --> 31:16.167
A good cry is cathartic.

31:19.002 --> 31:21.505
I need a piece of metal,
something to short the fuse.

31:21.671 --> 31:24.800
Uh-- Oh, here, here, here.

31:26.385 --> 31:28.479
You can't jam metal
in the circuit breaker.

31:28.637 --> 31:32.312
-You're gonna burn your hands.
-Right, I need something to insulate it.

31:32.849 --> 31:35.022
-Here, shirt.
-Right, shirt.

31:39.272 --> 31:40.489
Whoa.

31:40.649 --> 31:44.028
-You look hot.
-So do you.

31:45.821 --> 31:47.915
-I love you.
-Yeah.

31:51.868 --> 31:54.246
One last chance.

31:54.413 --> 31:57.257
Omen or pain?

32:19.938 --> 32:23.442
The Omen or pain?

32:23.650 --> 32:25.869
Shouldn't there be a third option? Heh.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.531
What are you doing?

32:29.698 --> 32:32.918
-Who, me?
-Where's your shirt?

32:33.869 --> 32:37.373
Heh. It's kind of a long story.
Let me tell you the short one.

32:39.082 --> 32:41.585
This is going to be very, very painful.

32:44.671 --> 32:46.218
Here we go.

32:47.883 --> 32:49.430
Hey!

32:49.926 --> 32:51.428
What was that?

32:59.603 --> 33:00.729
Sorry, Chuck.

33:01.229 --> 33:02.902
There's usually a backup generator.

33:03.565 --> 33:04.691
Oh.

33:04.858 --> 33:06.405
Just FYI.

33:06.568 --> 33:08.115
Oh, my God.

33:10.447 --> 33:13.075
I can't believe he'd do the drop
on his own without me.

33:13.909 --> 33:17.789
He thinks it's the Bartowski Curse, that
he can protect me by leaving me behind.

33:17.954 --> 33:21.424
-And instead, he's walking into a trap.
-Let's just hope he's smart.

33:21.583 --> 33:23.585
If he gives up the Omen,
they're all dead.

33:26.630 --> 33:29.304
Thanks for trying to save me.
I really do appreciate it.

33:29.466 --> 33:32.595
No sweat, man. It just kind of
seemed like the right thing to do.

33:32.761 --> 33:34.434
Are you done?

33:34.846 --> 33:39.477
Tell me where you hid the Omen
or I permanently change this man's face.

33:39.643 --> 33:42.817
Not the face. No.

33:42.979 --> 33:47.485
Out the front doors, 30 paces south,
under the yellow rosebush to the right.

33:47.943 --> 33:49.820
You're joking.

33:51.321 --> 33:52.994
You're not joking.

34:17.304 --> 34:19.399
Oh, my God. Thank you.

34:19.558 --> 34:23.313
-It's gonna be okay.
-Rescuing Bartowskis is our business.

34:26.147 --> 34:30.994
I'm a little upset I didn't get
to use the Toy. It's truly my favorite part.

34:31.152 --> 34:34.577
Do you have any idea
how much damage that virus will cause?

34:35.156 --> 34:37.875
In truth, Chuck,
the virus is just a piece of the plan.

34:39.159 --> 34:41.504
-What do you mean?
-Means I don't know.

34:41.663 --> 34:44.007
I'm just doing my job,
cleaning up Decker's mess.

34:44.165 --> 34:47.339
-I release the virus and then I'm done.
-What happens now?

34:47.502 --> 34:49.550
That's the real surprise, isn't it?

34:49.795 --> 34:54.016
You've pissed off
a lot of powerful people, Chuck.

34:56.261 --> 34:59.891
There. The Omen is officially
unleashed upon the world.

35:01.433 --> 35:03.527
Sorry, I'm afraid
I don't need you anymore.

35:03.685 --> 35:05.904
You still don't know
who you're dealing with, do you?

35:06.062 --> 35:09.236
Right now there's a spy in your midst.

35:09.399 --> 35:12.198
She'll take you and all your men down
to save her husband.

35:12.360 --> 35:15.705
Your sister? The doctor?

35:20.035 --> 35:22.879
Are you kidding me? Again?

35:47.604 --> 35:49.231
All clear.

35:49.397 --> 35:50.899
All clear.

35:57.572 --> 36:00.075
Put down the gun.
Now.

36:00.742 --> 36:03.120
Walker. Casey.

36:04.412 --> 36:06.585
-I give up.
-Robyn Cunnings.

36:06.748 --> 36:08.421
You don't get off that easy.

36:12.379 --> 36:14.006
Safe. Come on out.

36:15.298 --> 36:17.426
Chuck. Devon, honey, are you okay?

36:17.592 --> 36:19.720
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm good, I'm good.

36:19.886 --> 36:21.888
Mm. Mm, I'm just really cold.

36:22.931 --> 36:24.433
I love you. Mm, I love you.

36:24.599 --> 36:26.192
We are so not meant to be spies.

36:28.144 --> 36:29.896
Don't worry. I'm fine too, really.

36:32.482 --> 36:34.985
I love you so much.

36:35.819 --> 36:39.540
-You're upset. I can see you're upset.
-This isn't over.

36:40.448 --> 36:43.122
Hey, Sarah-- Guys?

36:44.828 --> 36:48.458
I'm still-- I'm still tied.
I'm still bound.

36:48.623 --> 36:50.466
Little help.

36:55.964 --> 36:57.966
Looks like we found a conspirator.

36:58.133 --> 36:59.726
You're gonna tell me everything.

36:59.926 --> 37:03.351
What exactly the plan is.
Who you're working for. All of it.

37:03.513 --> 37:07.984
I have nothing to say to you.
You're not my general.

37:11.438 --> 37:15.568
You know, we found something
interesting at the factory.

37:17.652 --> 37:20.405
I'm very excited to see how it works.

37:20.572 --> 37:23.246
I believe you call it the Toy.

37:39.424 --> 37:41.847
Robyn has confessed
to the conspiracy.

37:42.010 --> 37:44.183
I am happy to say
on behalf of the U.S. government...

37:44.345 --> 37:47.565
...all charges against this team
have been dropped.

37:48.016 --> 37:52.021
Oh, and Casey, your record shall
be expunged. You're free to go home.

37:52.187 --> 37:53.404
Hmm.

37:53.563 --> 37:57.693
General, that's all fantastic news,
uh, but what about the Omen virus?

37:57.859 --> 37:59.953
-Who did Robyn work for?
-Robyn didn't know.

38:00.111 --> 38:05.709
But we have our top people working on
the virus. For now, well done, team.

38:07.994 --> 38:10.873
It was a bit like old times, wasn't it?

38:16.211 --> 38:18.054
So...

38:18.880 --> 38:22.510
...no living on the I am,
running from the law.

38:23.009 --> 38:25.808
Sounded a little romantic, didn't it?

38:27.388 --> 38:29.390
-You're still mad?
-You left without me.

38:29.557 --> 38:31.400
I'm sorry, Sarah.

38:31.559 --> 38:34.733
I'm sorry. It was stupid.
I didn't wanna take you down with me...

38:34.896 --> 38:37.069
-...and my family's curse.
-There is no curse.

38:37.232 --> 38:40.577
You're not your father. You're not fated
to be alone or hurt anybody.

38:40.735 --> 38:44.615
Those things happen because of the
choices that people make, that you make.

38:45.573 --> 38:49.419
You're right. I'll never do it again,
leave without you.

38:49.577 --> 38:54.424
The Bartowski Family Curse ends here,
and not with me, with us.

39:00.255 --> 39:05.978
If you ever go out alone again,
just remember, I'm a trained assassin.

39:06.177 --> 39:09.807
-Noted.
-Good.

39:13.351 --> 39:15.194
Wouldn't shoot me, would you?

39:17.647 --> 39:19.866
Yeah? Great news, man.

39:20.066 --> 39:23.445
The agents are dispersing.
I wonder what's going on.

39:23.611 --> 39:26.285
Yup, you got it, Chuck.
Mission aborted.

39:26.447 --> 39:28.324
I'll see you soon. Okay.

39:29.492 --> 39:31.119
Great news. We're not on the I am.

39:31.286 --> 39:33.539
-Don't need Chuck's P.A.N.T.S.
-That's great.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.173
But you just got it.

39:35.707 --> 39:39.462
It's all right. I'll shoot over to the
apartment and put it back. No problem.

39:39.627 --> 39:42.881
Just gotta ask,
what's in Chuck's P.A.N.T.S.?

39:43.089 --> 39:45.717
No, no, no. Not allowed.

39:49.304 --> 39:51.853
There's something
I can show you, however.

39:54.976 --> 39:57.104
I want you to have this. Uh....

39:58.021 --> 40:00.649
You know, in case something
terrible has happened to me.

40:00.815 --> 40:02.158
You keep an eye on it.

40:05.820 --> 40:08.243
-Last night was nuts, huh?
-Heh. Crazy.

40:08.406 --> 40:09.828
It was crazy. It was.

40:09.991 --> 40:13.791
But despite all the craziness,
kind of a nice date.

40:13.953 --> 40:16.672
Morgan, that was not a date.

40:17.415 --> 40:22.342
Yeah, no, well,
not in the conventional sense, right?

40:25.757 --> 40:28.681
-I should get going.
-Heh. Okay.

40:28.885 --> 40:30.728
Okay. Um....

40:31.763 --> 40:33.185
Thank you for everything.

40:33.348 --> 40:36.648
-Yes. You too.
-All right.

40:52.575 --> 40:53.622
Ugh.

40:53.785 --> 40:58.382
I know that I am supposed to be tired
and a little freaked out...

40:58.539 --> 41:01.884
-...but last night was--
-Kind of incredible.

41:03.252 --> 41:04.629
Yeah.

41:04.796 --> 41:08.721
When you cracked that baddie over the
head with the bottle, that was pretty hot.

41:08.883 --> 41:12.558
I was gonna say the same thing
when you took out that electrical panel.

41:12.887 --> 41:16.482
What were you saying earlier
about Agent Provocateur?

41:23.731 --> 41:26.610
-So all's forgiven?
-Maybe.

41:27.735 --> 41:30.488
Okay, fine, all's forgiven.

41:30.905 --> 41:33.203
Oh, somethings wrong
with the computer.

41:41.124 --> 41:43.627
You mean all the computers.

41:46.587 --> 41:47.713
What is going on?

41:50.049 --> 41:51.301
It's the Omen virus.

41:51.467 --> 41:54.471
-It's affecting our entire system.
-It's not just our system.

41:54.637 --> 41:56.605
That is the Internet.
That is everybody.

42:00.768 --> 42:04.648
Oh, my God. This is all my fault.
I let it out and now the code is digging in.

42:04.814 --> 42:08.159
It's hiding in every networked computer
in the world, just waiting.

42:08.776 --> 42:10.528
Waiting for what?

42:12.947 --> 42:14.745
I don't know.

43:11.923 --> 43:15.052
Salut, c'est moi, Chuck.
Petite piqÃ»re de rappel.
