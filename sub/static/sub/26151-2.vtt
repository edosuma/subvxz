00:00.784 --> 00:02.286
<i>Previously on "You"...</i>

00:02.286 --> 00:03.320
Everyone just calls me Beck.

00:03.320 --> 00:05.022
And you are Joe?

00:05.022 --> 00:06.357
Goldberg.

00:06.357 --> 00:08.325
A guy needs to protect himself,

00:08.825 --> 00:11.328
and your name was
a glorious place to start.

00:11.328 --> 00:13.597
The next thing our little
friend the Internet gave me

00:13.597 --> 00:14.898
was your address.

00:16.666 --> 00:18.301
Professor Leahy.

00:18.301 --> 00:20.270
Professor Obvious
wants to sleep with you.

00:20.270 --> 00:22.138
Your friends are disloyal,

00:22.138 --> 00:24.107
and that Peach is the queen bee.

00:24.107 --> 00:26.710
How broke are you?

00:26.710 --> 00:29.946
Benjamin J. Ashby, Greenwich
born, boarding school bred.

00:29.946 --> 00:32.415
God, you make me insane.

00:34.251 --> 00:35.752
Oh!

00:37.687 --> 00:39.055
I think I know you.

00:39.055 --> 00:41.491
Oh, right.
Of course.

00:41.491 --> 00:45.028
You're smart, except in
the ways you are really not,

00:45.028 --> 00:47.063
like not locking your phone.

00:47.063 --> 00:48.498
Maybe we could get
a drink sometime.

00:48.498 --> 00:50.100
Sure.

00:50.100 --> 00:51.735
What you really need is
someone to save you.

00:51.735 --> 00:53.937
Man, I'm thinking maybe...

00:53.937 --> 00:55.805
Whatever you think I did...

00:55.805 --> 00:57.007
I can help, Beck.

00:57.007 --> 00:58.141
You got the wrong guy.

00:58.141 --> 01:01.144
Let me help you.

01:02.512 --> 01:04.813
Tonight's the night, Beck.

01:04.813 --> 01:06.950
Our first date.

01:06.950 --> 01:10.453
It just feels right, right?

01:14.591 --> 01:17.193
I'm looking forward to it,
and I think,

01:17.193 --> 01:19.329
obvious hangover aside,
you are, too.

01:19.329 --> 01:22.065
But I've read people wrong
in the past.

01:22.065 --> 01:25.201
One day, I'll tell you
about Candace,

01:25.201 --> 01:27.704
every red flag I was blind to,

01:27.704 --> 01:29.973
how destroyed I was.

01:29.973 --> 01:31.675
What can I say?
We all have baggage.

01:31.675 --> 01:35.078
But I feel like I'm dealing
with it the right way.

01:35.078 --> 01:37.447
Not bothering you,
just checking it.

01:42.652 --> 01:45.155
Hanging with you like this is
admittedly honing skills

01:45.155 --> 01:50.026
I never knew I'd need,
but hey, handy.

01:54.331 --> 01:56.366
You can't afford new clothes,
but let's be real.

01:56.366 --> 01:59.002
You'd look perfect
in a potato sack.

02:02.105 --> 02:04.774
Not a criticism,
God knows I am, too,

02:04.774 --> 02:06.276
but you seem distracted.

02:09.245 --> 02:11.648
Of course, a new phone.

02:11.648 --> 02:14.017
Not sure how you went
24 hours without one.

02:14.017 --> 02:16.753
As you activate
your new friend there,

02:16.753 --> 02:19.889
I know you think you're also
deactivating your old one.

02:19.889 --> 02:21.658
But here's where you're wrong.

02:21.658 --> 02:23.293
Your old phone, which I have,

02:23.293 --> 02:25.695
is still logged into the cloud.

02:29.466 --> 02:33.236
And that means
I'm still logged into you.

02:33.236 --> 02:35.405
Sci-fi movies are so wrong.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.307
Technology is our friend.

02:37.307 --> 02:39.442
You've reached Benji.
Leave some love. Namaste.

02:39.442 --> 02:41.277
Hey, look,
you haven't texted back.

02:41.277 --> 02:44.214
Just let me know
you're okay, okay?

02:44.214 --> 02:48.018
That's all I ask.
This is really annoying, Benji.

02:51.521 --> 02:53.523
It is annoying.

02:53.523 --> 02:55.792
You're not thinking about us,
you're thinking about him.

02:55.792 --> 02:59.295
I kind of thought I took care
of that for you, Beck.

02:59.295 --> 03:01.364
Want to start off the class
this morning?

03:01.364 --> 03:02.866
- Sure.
- Good.

03:02.866 --> 03:04.534
My last T.A. was like
a little mouse,

03:04.534 --> 03:06.069
afraid of public speaking.
Oh, that's my job.

03:06.069 --> 03:07.637
Well, lucky us,
you're good at it.

03:07.637 --> 03:09.706
We're still on for tomorrow,
drinks, poetry?

03:09.706 --> 03:12.042
Nothing if not up
for both of those.

03:14.000 --> 03:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:21.518 --> 03:23.586
Hey, they came for the big day.

03:23.586 --> 03:25.455
Want me move them down
to the basement?

03:25.455 --> 03:27.390
No, I'll do that. Just get
started on the window display.

03:27.390 --> 03:30.393
Oh, hey, I was thinking about
making cookies for #ReleaseDay.

03:30.393 --> 03:32.829
Amanda Chantal Bacon has a dope
recipe in "Moon Juice Cookbook:

03:32.829 --> 03:34.998
Cook Cosmically for Body,
Beauty, and Consciousness."

03:34.998 --> 03:36.533
Kill me.

03:36.533 --> 03:37.467
Sounds great, Ethan.

03:37.467 --> 03:38.968
Oh, and that kid is back.

03:38.968 --> 03:41.671
Paco?

03:45.809 --> 03:47.744
Hey, speed reader.

03:47.744 --> 03:48.812
Hi, Joe.

03:48.812 --> 03:50.447
What are you reading?

03:50.447 --> 03:51.915
This book about werewolves
the girls in my class

03:51.915 --> 03:53.416
won't stop talking about.

03:53.416 --> 03:57.720
It's more about love stuff
than werewolf stuff.

03:57.720 --> 04:00.223
There should be right up here...

04:00.223 --> 04:03.560
Yeah, it's right here.
Here, try this.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.197
"Frankenstein"?

04:07.197 --> 04:09.499
Yeah, the monster is
really cool and scary

04:09.499 --> 04:12.035
but also not really the monster.

04:12.035 --> 04:14.037
What does that mean?

04:14.037 --> 04:15.538
Just read it.
You can tell me.

04:15.538 --> 04:18.841
Ethan's got snacks.
Set 'em up.

04:36.659 --> 04:39.762
Let me the hell outta here!

04:39.762 --> 04:41.064
Now!

04:41.064 --> 04:42.832
Settle down, Benji.

04:42.832 --> 04:43.867
Let's talk.

04:48.205 --> 04:51.630
<font color="#800080">Synced & corrected by</font> <font color="#00FFFF">MaxPayne</font>
== <font color="#808000">https://</font>subscene<font color="#808000">.com</font> ==

04:51.808 --> 04:54.043
Okay, granted I didn't think
too far ahead

04:54.043 --> 04:55.778
when I swung that mallet.

04:55.778 --> 04:58.681
I just knew Benji was
the worst kind of poison,

04:58.681 --> 05:00.884
the kind you know is bad
but can't stop taking.

05:00.884 --> 05:03.419
So I did what I had to do
to help you, Beck.

05:03.419 --> 05:05.889
And now, there's
an adult human male

05:05.889 --> 05:07.323
in the basement
of this bookstore.

05:07.323 --> 05:08.591
Somebody!

05:08.591 --> 05:09.792
The basement's soundproof.

05:09.792 --> 05:11.294
Aah!

05:11.294 --> 05:13.229
The owner loved to
read in peace down here.

05:13.229 --> 05:15.165
I'm sorry.

05:15.165 --> 05:16.533
I told you,
I don't know who you are,

05:16.533 --> 05:18.935
I don't know why I'm here.
I swear.

05:18.935 --> 05:21.771
Confession, I have no idea
what to do with him now.

05:21.771 --> 05:23.940
I'm gonna give you
my family lawyer's number.

05:23.940 --> 05:25.408
He'll get you paid.

05:25.408 --> 05:27.110
Of course he thinks
I want money.

05:27.110 --> 05:28.811
You know who my father is?

05:28.811 --> 05:31.814
Benjamin Ashby II,
hedge fund manager.

05:31.814 --> 05:34.184
We have a jet. We'll send
you anywhere in the world.

05:34.184 --> 05:37.754
Best case, that's somewhere
far away from you, Beck.

05:37.754 --> 05:41.324
Worst case,
that ends with prison time.

05:41.324 --> 05:43.893
Not an option.

05:45.728 --> 05:48.364
It's a poppy seed bagel,
extra schmear.

05:48.364 --> 05:51.000
Go to hell.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.336
I don't eat gluten.

05:53.336 --> 05:55.872
It's an allergy, okay?
That shit is real.

05:55.872 --> 05:58.875
Gluten, dairy, if I ate
a peanut, I could die.

05:58.875 --> 06:01.811
Well, gosh,
whatever can I get you?

06:01.811 --> 06:04.781
I'd just like a bare burger
wrapped in chard.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.549
Or I could do sushi.

06:06.549 --> 06:07.717
Sushi?

06:07.717 --> 06:11.221
My diet is limited.
Please?

06:12.355 --> 06:14.657
Whoever you are,
you're not a killer.

06:14.657 --> 06:16.326
Oh, how I wish I was.

06:16.326 --> 06:18.428
This would be
much less complicated.

06:18.428 --> 06:20.496
Let me out of here.

06:20.496 --> 06:23.700
I won't say anything to anyone.

06:23.700 --> 06:26.135
He doesn't even know my name.
I can figure this out.

06:26.135 --> 06:28.371
I'm claustrophobic.

06:28.371 --> 06:31.407
My blood sugar's low.

06:34.410 --> 06:35.979
Is this sugar?

06:35.979 --> 06:38.982
I found it in your wallet along
with three bars of Xanax,

06:38.982 --> 06:41.718
Adderall, half a sheet of,
I think, acid, is it?

06:41.718 --> 06:43.319
Whatever.
It's not even for me.

06:43.319 --> 06:44.420
I network.
I own a business.

06:44.420 --> 06:45.888
That's right, Home Soda.

06:45.888 --> 06:48.124
It's artisanal.
It's gonna blow up.

06:48.124 --> 06:49.392
Is it?

06:49.392 --> 06:51.894
Do your investors know
you do heroin?

06:51.894 --> 06:55.131
Or your... your father?
How about your girlfriend?

06:55.131 --> 06:58.434
I don't have a girlfriend.

07:00.937 --> 07:03.306
Oh, shit!

07:03.306 --> 07:06.009
That's where I know you from.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.313
You were in the cab!

07:10.313 --> 07:11.714
Beck's cab!

07:11.714 --> 07:13.149
She... she said your name.

07:13.149 --> 07:15.385
It's Jimmy. No.

07:15.385 --> 07:18.187
This is Joe.
He literally saved my life.

07:18.187 --> 07:19.522
It's Joe!

07:19.522 --> 07:22.025
Now, that's a complication.

07:22.025 --> 07:25.094
Do not tell me that you're
doing this because of Beck.

07:25.094 --> 07:26.362
She's not my girlfriend.

07:26.362 --> 07:27.764
You can have her!

07:27.764 --> 07:28.898
Take her!

07:28.898 --> 07:30.300
Careful, Benji.

07:30.300 --> 07:31.801
Not winning any points.

07:31.801 --> 07:32.835
If you knew her,

07:32.835 --> 07:35.171
you would not be
putting me in a cage

07:35.171 --> 07:39.142
and ruining your life over
Guinevere Goddamn Beck!

07:42.312 --> 07:43.346
If you want out,

07:43.346 --> 07:45.081
you'll do what I want.

07:51.120 --> 07:53.022
The days of being with a man
who doesn't value you,

07:53.022 --> 07:54.524
those are over.

07:54.524 --> 07:57.327
If we can get over
the first date hump.

07:58.761 --> 08:01.230
Can't help it,
worried about Benji.

08:01.230 --> 08:02.965
That's why it's so crucial
Benji's out of your picture.

08:02.965 --> 08:04.867
Please, he's off
getting shit-faced.

08:04.867 --> 08:06.836
Or he's in some kind of trouble.

08:06.836 --> 08:09.372
What we have right now is
just a little spark.

08:09.372 --> 08:11.274
Every choice is a message.

08:11.274 --> 08:14.110
With Candace, I always felt
like I was pushing.

08:15.578 --> 08:18.214
But now I realize,
can't force it,

08:18.214 --> 08:20.183
the timing, the spark.

08:20.183 --> 08:22.885
So you tell me if
you're too distracted, Beck.

08:22.885 --> 08:25.588
You decide.

08:25.588 --> 08:28.624
Sure. Looking forward.
Free at six.

08:45.675 --> 08:48.144
So it was just one of those
cheesy diaries with a lock,

08:48.144 --> 08:50.012
but I couldn't stop writing.

08:50.012 --> 08:53.750
I just... I felt better having it
all down on paper, you know?

08:53.750 --> 08:55.918
And then I did this little
creative writing assignment

08:55.918 --> 08:57.820
and it just blew
my teacher's mind.

08:57.820 --> 09:00.323
She acted like it was the best
thing she'd...

09:00.323 --> 09:02.959
Honestly, part of me thought
this date would never come,

09:02.959 --> 09:05.661
and now it feels so easy,
so right.

09:05.661 --> 09:09.198
This is how our story goes,
Beck.

09:09.198 --> 09:11.501
And here I am.

09:11.501 --> 09:15.104
Sometimes you just,
you do things on instinct

09:15.104 --> 09:18.641
because you have to, and
then you scramble, you know.

09:18.641 --> 09:22.545
Yeah, I kinda know.

09:22.545 --> 09:24.814
I totally didn't Google
you, but if I did,

09:24.814 --> 09:27.517
I might discover you
aren't on social media.

09:27.517 --> 09:31.154
Fact, it renders you insanely
vulnerable with zero upside.

09:31.154 --> 09:32.688
I'm an old-fashioned guy.

09:32.688 --> 09:34.690
I like real life.

09:34.690 --> 09:36.159
What about your job?

09:36.159 --> 09:37.527
Bookstore manager or...

09:37.527 --> 09:39.662
Or international
super spy, which is...

09:39.662 --> 09:42.698
I mean, is that your goal or...

09:44.534 --> 09:46.102
I know I'm in a city
full of people

09:46.102 --> 09:48.905
with... with... with big, fat
neon sign aspirations.

09:48.905 --> 09:52.875
And I know it's not cool to say
and it's not big and flashy...

09:55.678 --> 09:58.314
but I love books,

09:58.314 --> 10:03.085
and I want my life to be about
what I actually love.

10:03.085 --> 10:05.988
Yeah, I get that.

10:11.127 --> 10:13.963
Sorry, just a second, okay?

10:13.963 --> 10:16.265
Yeah, go ahead.

10:16.265 --> 10:19.368
Hey.

10:19.368 --> 10:22.371
Yeah, I know it's serious,
Peach.

10:22.371 --> 10:23.773
I'm the one who told you
I was worried.

10:23.773 --> 10:27.076
Okay.
Yes, I'm coming.

10:30.279 --> 10:33.149
I'm sorry, I have to go.

10:33.149 --> 10:36.219
This friend, he just... apparently
he had to go meet someone

10:36.219 --> 10:37.920
and never came back.

10:37.920 --> 10:39.222
It's worrying.

10:39.222 --> 10:40.723
We can pick it up some other
time if you have to.

10:40.723 --> 10:42.925
All right, thank you.

10:42.925 --> 10:44.894
I hope your friend is okay.

10:44.894 --> 10:46.562
I thought I'd done it,

10:46.562 --> 10:48.698
gotten Benji out of our way.

10:48.698 --> 10:50.933
Looks like I have to
finish the job.

10:55.829 --> 10:57.664
To figure out what to do
with the poster boy

10:57.664 --> 10:59.566
for white male privilege
in the cage,

10:59.566 --> 11:01.835
I need to understand
who he truly is.

11:01.835 --> 11:05.172
And to do that, I need to know
what he cares about.

11:05.172 --> 11:06.640
This is totally unfair.

11:06.640 --> 11:08.142
If I knew you were
gonna quiz me,

11:08.142 --> 11:09.877
I'd have put more recent
books on the list.

11:09.877 --> 11:12.379
So bottom line, you've never
even read "On the Road."

11:12.379 --> 11:14.014
It's very possible to
read a book

11:14.014 --> 11:16.917
without having to read it
in the traditional manner.

11:16.917 --> 11:18.051
You can read about a book.

11:18.051 --> 11:22.256
Yeah, I get it.

11:22.256 --> 11:23.490
You're a fraud.

11:23.490 --> 11:25.425
Here, give me the stupid book.

11:25.425 --> 11:27.528
I'll read it right now,
you sadistic prick.

11:27.528 --> 11:30.664
Anything to get me out of here.

11:30.664 --> 11:32.833
I do understand something
about you now, Beck.

11:32.833 --> 11:36.370
You somehow think this guy
is all you deserve.

11:36.370 --> 11:38.105
You're looking a little gray
and mealy in there.

11:38.105 --> 11:40.507
Yeah, no shit.
You stole my stash!

11:40.507 --> 11:43.076
I thought it wasn't for you.

11:43.076 --> 11:45.245
Fine.

11:45.245 --> 11:48.482
You happy? It's mine.
I'm a chipper.

11:48.482 --> 11:51.618
I never do it more than
three days in a row.

11:51.618 --> 11:52.986
And I'm quitting.

11:52.986 --> 11:56.390
Okay, only if you're quitting.

12:05.332 --> 12:07.467
Doesn't work that way.

12:07.467 --> 12:10.771
It's only one way.

12:12.506 --> 12:15.375
Thank you.
Thank you.

12:19.012 --> 12:22.349
Just one more thing.

12:23.951 --> 12:24.952
Password.

12:32.993 --> 12:34.928
Leanna.

12:34.928 --> 12:36.697
L-E-A-N-N-A.

12:36.697 --> 12:39.933
His phone lock is
another girl's name, Beck.

12:39.933 --> 12:42.803
Jesus Christ.

12:44.705 --> 12:45.872
Oh, yeah.

12:52.679 --> 12:55.382
Well, he's been living
a frankly off-brand life

12:55.382 --> 12:57.317
for a guy who markets
health soda.

12:57.317 --> 12:59.086
Based on the evidence,

12:59.086 --> 13:00.554
he's not missing you
when you're gone.

13:00.554 --> 13:02.990
You don't mean anything to him.

13:11.898 --> 13:13.500
Say cheese.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.068
I was worried.
I called his mother.

13:15.068 --> 13:16.603
We were about to call
the police, and he's high

13:16.603 --> 13:18.205
in some random shitburg
in Massachusetts

13:18.205 --> 13:20.340
according to his geolocation.

13:20.340 --> 13:22.909
Don't say geolocation.
You're not a stalker.

13:22.909 --> 13:25.012
At least we know he's fine,
just being the worst.

13:25.012 --> 13:28.649
So we're all gonna go try
that new bar tonight, right?

13:28.649 --> 13:29.583
In SoHo.

13:29.583 --> 13:31.251
You are such a lush.

13:31.251 --> 13:33.186
Shit, I can't go.
I'm sorry.

13:33.186 --> 13:36.189
I'm supposed to have drinks
with my thesis adviser.

13:36.189 --> 13:37.591
Oh.

13:37.591 --> 13:40.327
Ugh, scale of one
to ten, how pervy?

13:40.327 --> 13:41.995
He won an award
for a book of poems

13:41.995 --> 13:45.532
that probably has 35 references
to, like, vagina lips.

13:45.532 --> 13:47.601
Well, banging your professor
is like a grad school

13:47.601 --> 13:49.036
rite of passage.
Is it?

13:49.036 --> 13:50.937
Annika's like the Wikipedia
page for slut, so...

13:50.937 --> 13:53.340
Whatever. I banged
my bio professor.

13:53.340 --> 13:54.675
It was fine.

13:54.675 --> 13:56.276
Notably, I passed the class.

13:56.276 --> 13:57.878
You know, eyes on the prize.

13:57.878 --> 13:59.279
Ovary up, girl.

13:59.279 --> 14:01.715
Beck doesn't want to ovary up.

14:01.715 --> 14:03.617
He controls
my status as a T.A.

14:03.617 --> 14:05.018
He could knock me
out of my housing.

14:05.018 --> 14:07.721
Or you could not figure
it out and report him.

14:07.721 --> 14:09.890
I think it only works
that way in the movies.

14:09.890 --> 14:13.927
Whatever.
We're seeing you tomorrow.

14:13.927 --> 14:15.595
My party.

14:15.595 --> 14:19.366
Tomorrow is the anniversary
of my parents' divorce.

14:19.366 --> 14:21.902
The party I always have
to distract myself.

14:21.902 --> 14:24.538
Of course. Sorry.
I'm coming.

14:29.376 --> 14:32.846
One more line, man, come on.

14:32.846 --> 14:36.350
Just tell me your plan
and I will help you.

14:36.350 --> 14:38.118
Where is she right now?

14:38.118 --> 14:40.187
She's partying her face off
with Lynn and Annika, right?

14:40.187 --> 14:42.689
Actually, she's about
to meet her thesis adviser,

14:42.689 --> 14:45.726
but glad to hear
you take her seriously.

14:45.726 --> 14:50.397
See, this is
what I'm telling you.

14:50.397 --> 14:53.367
You see this hardworking
writer chick.

14:53.367 --> 14:55.102
How could you not?

14:55.102 --> 14:57.204
She's branded the living shit
out of herself

14:57.204 --> 14:58.438
across the Internet.

14:58.438 --> 15:00.006
I want you to know,

15:00.006 --> 15:01.641
if I wasn't about
to be late to see you,

15:01.641 --> 15:03.577
I would beat this guy bloody

15:03.577 --> 15:05.545
for the way he talks about you.

15:05.545 --> 15:09.583
I'm telling you,
this is her thing.

15:09.583 --> 15:12.619
Right now, she's got on
red lipstick

15:12.619 --> 15:16.223
and she's getting ready to
work her professor hard

15:16.223 --> 15:18.425
for that "A."

15:18.425 --> 15:21.461
I'll see you later, Benji.

15:21.461 --> 15:23.430
Hey, come back.

15:23.430 --> 15:26.433
I'm hungry!

15:35.142 --> 15:36.977
There's a directness.

15:36.977 --> 15:39.379
That's what's special
about your work.

15:39.379 --> 15:41.782
So if it's not direct
to the bone, cut it.

15:41.782 --> 15:44.818
Thanks.
That's really helpful.

15:44.818 --> 15:47.954
And coming from you,
it means a lot.

15:47.954 --> 15:51.525
A lot of people find
a direct woman irresistible.

15:51.525 --> 15:54.428
You should lean into that
in your life as well.

15:54.428 --> 15:57.564
Yeah, easier said than done.

15:57.564 --> 16:00.367
Well, you can always
practice on me.

16:00.367 --> 16:03.470
I'm safe.

16:03.470 --> 16:06.039
You really have nothing
to be nervous about.

16:07.474 --> 16:11.144
The world is your
bright red apple.

16:11.144 --> 16:14.815
You think he writes these
lines in advance like a poem?

16:17.384 --> 16:19.653
I wish I had your...
confidence.

16:19.653 --> 16:25.292
Putting your work out
into the world is a service.

16:25.292 --> 16:26.993
I'll try and remember that.

16:26.993 --> 16:28.962
I wouldn't tell you
if you weren't talented.

16:28.962 --> 16:31.298
I'm happy to share
all my secrets.

16:31.298 --> 16:35.969
So, Beck, maybe it's time to
acknowledge what there is here.

16:45.912 --> 16:49.549
Don't touch me.
It's not sexy, it's repulsive.

16:54.020 --> 16:55.155
Sorry, but this is...

16:55.155 --> 16:56.556
You invited me to.

16:56.556 --> 16:58.358
No, I didn't.

16:58.358 --> 17:00.126
You flirt brazenly.

17:00.126 --> 17:02.295
You wear clothes so sheer
I can see your nipples.

17:02.295 --> 17:03.763
What do you call that?

17:03.763 --> 17:05.232
- It's crazy.
- If you're gonna stay

17:05.232 --> 17:08.969
on the safe side of the
plausible deniability zone,

17:08.969 --> 17:11.304
cover your tits,

17:11.304 --> 17:13.173
stop the blow-job eyes,

17:13.173 --> 17:16.643
and write... better.

17:16.643 --> 17:18.345
I like you,

17:18.345 --> 17:20.046
but clearly you're overworked.

17:20.046 --> 17:24.117
It's only right to release you
from the T.A. position.

17:24.117 --> 17:25.218
No. No, please.

17:25.218 --> 17:28.421
Get some rest.

17:28.421 --> 17:30.023
You're right to be angry.

17:30.023 --> 17:33.693
Some things can't
just be allowed to be.

17:33.693 --> 17:36.663
Something has to be done
about someone like him.

17:51.978 --> 17:53.146
Hello.

17:53.146 --> 17:55.882
Hey, where are you?

17:55.882 --> 17:57.918
I'm in the Village.

17:57.918 --> 18:01.955
Maybe we can finish our talk.

18:01.955 --> 18:05.158
Yeah, I'll be there in 15.

18:18.979 --> 18:20.681
Are you staring at my lipstick?

18:20.681 --> 18:21.949
No, no.
No, I'm not.

18:21.949 --> 18:23.383
I'm not.
No, it's just different.

18:23.383 --> 18:26.787
No, I just... I wanted
to try something new,

18:26.787 --> 18:29.056
but you're right,
it's not really me.

18:29.056 --> 18:31.024
So why did you call me?

18:31.024 --> 18:33.593
I don't know.
Spontaneous impulse.

18:33.593 --> 18:35.629
That's okay. You'll learn
you can tell me anything.

18:35.629 --> 18:37.130
We cut it short last time
because a friend of yours,

18:37.130 --> 18:38.532
he was missing, right?

18:38.532 --> 18:41.601
Oh, God, he's fine.
He's just an idiot.

18:41.601 --> 18:43.737
Agree with you there,
but you want to keep it light.

18:43.737 --> 18:45.272
I can do that.

18:45.272 --> 18:48.342
Okay, this couple here
coming in the door,

18:48.342 --> 18:50.644
what do you think, first date?

18:50.644 --> 18:54.481
Third. She's not sure
she wants to seal the deal.

18:54.481 --> 18:56.116
Hmm.

18:56.116 --> 18:58.852
And those two.

18:58.852 --> 19:00.721
Where?

19:00.721 --> 19:01.989
Brink of divorce.

19:01.989 --> 19:05.592
Ooh, that's cold.

19:05.592 --> 19:08.261
Okay.

19:09.963 --> 19:11.631
Oh, that's easy.

19:11.631 --> 19:15.135
It's us in 30 years.

19:15.135 --> 19:17.137
And that was way too much.

19:17.137 --> 19:18.805
I love that.

19:21.308 --> 19:23.243
Wow, you're in super good
shape for an old guy.

19:23.243 --> 19:25.712
Thank you, and you,
if I may say,

19:25.712 --> 19:28.648
are hot as ever.

19:28.648 --> 19:30.250
But in a dignified,
age-appropriate away.

19:30.250 --> 19:33.587
It's all the yoga.
It keeps me young.

19:36.857 --> 19:39.693
To be honest, Joe, I'm so happy

19:39.693 --> 19:42.162
that you could come tonight.

19:42.162 --> 19:43.663
It's been the worst day.

19:43.663 --> 19:46.800
My thesis adviser,
he made a pass at me.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.035
Oh, you're kidding.

19:48.035 --> 19:49.803
The most embarrassing part is

19:49.803 --> 19:52.873
I actually thought he
believed in me and my work.

19:52.873 --> 19:54.374
This isn't your fault.

19:54.374 --> 19:56.643
Yeah, but dumb shit
like this happens all the time.

19:56.643 --> 19:59.479
I'm starting to think
I'm some kind of magnet

19:59.479 --> 20:03.250
for, like, dudes
with serious issues.

20:04.785 --> 20:07.821
So what are you gonna do
about your thesis adviser?

20:07.821 --> 20:10.123
I don't know.
Get through it.

20:12.959 --> 20:15.295
I believe in you.

20:19.199 --> 20:21.568
Hey, do you want to come to
a party with me tomorrow?

20:21.568 --> 20:23.437
Already booking our next date.

20:23.437 --> 20:26.940
It's at a friend,
Peach Salinger's.

20:26.940 --> 20:28.608
Like J.D. Salinger?

20:28.608 --> 20:29.843
I mean, yes.

20:29.843 --> 20:31.111
Whoa! Wow.

20:31.111 --> 20:32.913
But she doesn't like
to talk about it.

20:32.913 --> 20:34.247
And she's a sweetheart.

20:34.247 --> 20:36.883
Her family's just
a little, you know?

20:36.883 --> 20:38.852
Yeah, whose isn't?

20:50.130 --> 20:52.966
Mm.
I like yours better.

20:56.570 --> 20:58.538
Well, let's give thanks to
our lord Stephen King,

20:58.538 --> 21:00.307
who bestoweth books
so that our bookstores

21:00.307 --> 21:02.843
in third dimensional
locations may live.

21:02.843 --> 21:06.046
It's cool how you
get in the monster's POV.

21:06.046 --> 21:08.248
You understand
why he does stuff.

21:08.248 --> 21:10.584
Almost like it's...

21:10.584 --> 21:11.985
Justified?

21:11.985 --> 21:14.087
Yeah, but then it's weird,

21:14.087 --> 21:15.655
'cause he's bad but not all bad.

21:15.655 --> 21:17.390
Quick Twitter break for Benj.

21:17.390 --> 21:18.859
Maybe Dr. Frankenstein's
the bad one

21:18.859 --> 21:22.729
for even making him, right?

21:22.729 --> 21:25.532
Well, I think it's open
to your interpretation.

21:25.532 --> 21:27.701
You ready?

21:29.002 --> 21:32.072
Let's do it then.
Release the kraken!

21:32.072 --> 21:34.441
Hey, come on in.
Hey, good morning.

21:34.441 --> 21:36.776
Cookies, homemade,
not just for me.

21:36.776 --> 21:39.012
Get a book.

21:39.012 --> 21:42.716
Thank you so much.
Your receipt is in the book.

21:42.716 --> 21:44.484
Whoa, we need another
box already.

21:44.484 --> 21:46.119
Ethan, can you watch
the register for a second?

21:46.119 --> 21:47.354
Kid ran down to
the basement to get it.

21:47.354 --> 21:49.022
I'm an idiot.
What? No.

21:49.022 --> 21:50.223
Yeah, I saw him grab the key.

21:51.725 --> 21:52.726
Paco!

22:04.538 --> 22:07.107
Paco!

22:07.107 --> 22:08.275
What did I say?

22:08.275 --> 22:09.643
I'm sorry.

22:09.643 --> 22:11.178
I told you not
to come down here.

22:11.178 --> 22:12.746
I just wanted to grab a book.

22:12.746 --> 22:14.514
Don't be an idiot!
Why would you do that?

22:14.514 --> 22:15.715
- I'm sorry.
- Why?

22:28.562 --> 22:31.965
So what happened with you
and Professor Vaj Lips?

22:31.965 --> 22:34.434
Let's just say I better
find a better job

22:34.434 --> 22:35.769
or some kind of housing or...

22:35.769 --> 22:38.505
I don't know.

22:39.706 --> 22:43.410
Okay, enough of this shit.

22:43.410 --> 22:46.279
Peach, no. I can't...
I can't accept it.

22:46.279 --> 22:47.714
Stop.

22:47.714 --> 22:51.351
It's just first, last,
and a deposit, okay.

22:53.286 --> 22:55.155
Don't be so noble, okay.

22:55.155 --> 22:57.557
Just take the check
and stop stressing.

22:57.557 --> 22:59.659
Here.

23:07.234 --> 23:09.269
Jesus Christ.

23:09.269 --> 23:12.505
If you want to kill me, what
the hell are you waiting for?

23:12.505 --> 23:15.108
Why would I want to kill him?

23:15.108 --> 23:16.643
Who wants to kill people?

23:16.643 --> 23:18.044
Three cups,

23:18.044 --> 23:20.313
one is your brand, Home Soda.

23:20.313 --> 23:21.915
It's the best, right?

23:21.915 --> 23:23.316
So prove it.

23:23.316 --> 23:24.718
Tell me which one it is.

23:24.718 --> 23:26.920
If I get this right,
I get a fix?

23:26.920 --> 23:29.923
If you get this right,

23:29.923 --> 23:32.659
I'll let you out.

23:46.539 --> 23:47.941
I need a palate cleanser.

23:47.941 --> 23:49.809
Cup two.

23:55.615 --> 23:57.117
Three.

24:05.025 --> 24:08.161
One, two, or three?

24:08.161 --> 24:10.430
I don't know.

24:12.732 --> 24:15.568
Wait!
None of them, okay!

24:15.568 --> 24:18.238
They all taste like stale,
cheap drugstore soda.

24:18.238 --> 24:21.441
They're not mine.

24:21.441 --> 24:22.809
They're all yours.

24:22.809 --> 24:24.210
That's bullshit!

24:24.210 --> 24:27.147
Home Soda is, obviously.

24:27.147 --> 24:29.549
Let me out of here!

24:29.549 --> 24:31.518
Let me out of here!

24:31.518 --> 24:34.587
You psychopath!

24:38.825 --> 24:40.593
Fine!

24:40.593 --> 24:43.496
You win!
I lose!

24:43.496 --> 24:45.598
We all lose.

24:45.598 --> 24:49.936
What am I gonna do with
this lying sack of shit, Beck?

24:49.936 --> 24:52.038
You want Beck, right?

24:53.340 --> 24:55.608
Let's... let's be clear.

24:55.608 --> 24:59.446
She does not want to be
with a guy like you.

24:59.446 --> 25:01.681
I can help you.

25:01.681 --> 25:04.918
No. Actually, she invited me
to a party tonight.

25:04.918 --> 25:06.186
To Peach Salinger's.

25:06.186 --> 25:09.823
A Salinger party, oh, Joe.

25:09.823 --> 25:12.826
She... she's taking you
to add texture.

25:12.826 --> 25:14.561
She wants to seem interesting,

25:14.561 --> 25:17.230
like she hangs out
with real folk.

25:17.230 --> 25:19.132
She's deep, she's an artist.

25:19.132 --> 25:20.734
Truth?

25:20.734 --> 25:22.969
Beck will always
leave someone like you

25:22.969 --> 25:25.405
for someone who can
take her places.

25:25.405 --> 25:27.507
We never made it
to a single party

25:27.507 --> 25:29.476
'cause she couldn't
jump on me fast enough.

25:29.476 --> 25:32.579
She's playing you for a chump,
my friend.

25:37.617 --> 25:39.719
So yeah, it was really bad.

25:39.719 --> 25:42.555
Basically, food poisoning
is the reason why

25:42.555 --> 25:44.124
Peach and I are friends.

25:44.124 --> 25:45.759
Puke does bond you.

25:45.759 --> 25:47.527
She show you her ladle?

25:47.527 --> 25:49.028
She's got this red
kitchen ladle.

25:49.028 --> 25:50.897
It's a whole call-you-daddy,
spank me thing.

25:50.897 --> 25:53.333
She's kinky as shit with me

25:53.333 --> 25:55.402
because I'm loaded.

25:55.402 --> 25:57.203
Not you 'cause...
'cause who are you?

25:57.203 --> 25:59.906
So hopefully nothing
gastrointestinal happens,

25:59.906 --> 26:04.244
but I do hope you guys
like each other.

26:08.982 --> 26:10.750
You want to change that.

26:10.750 --> 26:13.186
You need me.

26:16.589 --> 26:18.558
Shit.

26:24.897 --> 26:28.167
One look and I can tell you,
not my crowd.

26:28.167 --> 26:32.938
What they are is everything
Benji claims you want to be.

26:32.938 --> 26:34.239
Beckalish.

26:34.239 --> 26:35.774
Hi.

26:35.774 --> 26:37.176
Hey.

26:37.176 --> 26:38.777
Mwah, mwah.

26:38.777 --> 26:40.078
Here you go.
Thank you.

26:40.078 --> 26:41.947
Is this Joseph?

26:41.947 --> 26:43.115
Joe.

26:43.115 --> 26:44.383
Am I just texture here, Beck?

26:44.383 --> 26:46.318
Now, Joseph...

26:46.318 --> 26:47.719
Just... just Joe.

26:47.719 --> 26:49.354
I'm gonna have to borrow
our friend here.

26:49.354 --> 26:51.723
So make yourself at home.
Everyone here is friendly.

26:51.723 --> 26:54.226
Brown people don't bite.

26:55.527 --> 26:57.663
Alumni.

27:00.098 --> 27:01.200
Where'd you go?

27:01.200 --> 27:03.135
I didn't.

27:03.135 --> 27:04.503
Hmm.

27:04.503 --> 27:06.438
Come on.

27:16.482 --> 27:18.083
I blacked out.

27:18.083 --> 27:21.520
Annika Atwater,
rich and #carefree,

27:21.520 --> 27:24.122
building a brand as
a body positive influencer,

27:24.122 --> 27:25.824
which seems to involve

27:25.824 --> 27:28.694
wearing a lot of free stuff
on Instagram.

27:28.694 --> 27:31.797
Lynn Lieser, publicist,
# cocktaillover.

27:31.797 --> 27:33.699
Daughter of a surgeon
and tech CEO, adopted,

27:33.699 --> 27:37.269
and has all the smugness,
none of the angst.

28:11.436 --> 28:13.405
If you have a full set,
each one of them is worth

28:13.405 --> 28:15.607
three times as much
for a collector.

28:15.607 --> 28:17.676
You've read that one?

28:17.676 --> 28:20.579
Just the first one.

28:20.579 --> 28:23.882
Typical.

28:25.884 --> 28:29.187
You think I need some
illiterate working in my shop?

28:30.689 --> 28:32.457
No, hey.

28:32.457 --> 28:33.825
If you want to work
in this shop,

28:33.825 --> 28:36.862
you learn the value
of these books.

28:36.862 --> 28:38.797
Mr. Mooney, please.

28:38.797 --> 28:41.867
Everything you need is in there.

28:41.867 --> 28:43.402
- Please!
- Joseph.

28:43.402 --> 28:46.038
There you are.

28:47.339 --> 28:49.074
It's Joe, just Joe.

28:49.074 --> 28:51.743
This is a lovely
collection, Peaches.

28:51.743 --> 28:54.346
It's Peach, and, I mean, you've

28:54.346 --> 28:57.683
probably read more of these
books than I have.

28:57.683 --> 29:00.319
A good salesman has to
know his product, right?

29:01.853 --> 29:06.191
So you met Beck
at a book shop, right?

29:06.191 --> 29:07.893
That's right.

29:07.893 --> 29:10.095
Only in New York.

29:10.095 --> 29:11.663
And then you just
happened to meet again.

29:11.663 --> 29:15.200
Casual tone, detective eyes.

29:15.200 --> 29:16.868
Well, it's lucky we did.

29:16.868 --> 29:19.471
She was on the tracks
at the time.

29:19.471 --> 29:21.139
So I heard.

29:21.139 --> 29:22.874
Oh, God, thank goodness for you.

29:22.874 --> 29:26.345
I mean, being in Greenpoint
of all places

29:26.345 --> 29:30.215
at the very right moment.

29:32.818 --> 29:35.320
Oh, it's time for the toast.

29:49.167 --> 29:50.936
So in the time I was in there,

29:50.936 --> 29:53.572
you attract Benji 2.0.

29:53.572 --> 29:55.707
Peach looks thrilled.

29:55.707 --> 29:57.309
Are you thrilled?

29:57.309 --> 29:59.611
What do you want?

30:09.821 --> 30:11.990
So which Beck are you?

30:11.990 --> 30:15.160
The one I see
or the one Benji does?

30:20.432 --> 30:22.401
Hey, stranger.

30:22.401 --> 30:24.569
How are you holding up?

30:24.569 --> 30:26.872
Having fun?

30:31.009 --> 30:34.146
Beck.

30:35.213 --> 30:38.884
Why did you bring me here?

30:38.884 --> 30:42.154
I don't know.
I thought it could be fun?

30:42.154 --> 30:44.756
I don't think I have
a lot in common

30:44.756 --> 30:47.826
with your other friends.

30:47.826 --> 30:50.262
I like that about you.

30:52.798 --> 30:54.766
I always think I'm
gonna love these things,

30:54.766 --> 30:56.635
yet somehow never do.

30:56.635 --> 30:58.704
Then why did we come?

30:58.704 --> 31:01.640
It's been this way since Brown.

31:01.640 --> 31:04.242
Just feels like
I'm getting sucked in

31:04.242 --> 31:06.378
and I could just be me,

31:06.378 --> 31:09.915
yet that somehow never feels
quite good enough.

31:09.915 --> 31:12.651
You know, I stole
this dress to fit in,

31:12.651 --> 31:13.852
which is pathetic.

31:13.852 --> 31:15.253
I don't know about that.

31:15.253 --> 31:17.022
Yeah, not as pathetic
as the fact that Peach

31:17.022 --> 31:18.724
wrote me a check
to keep me afloat,

31:18.724 --> 31:21.727
which I don't want to cash
but now I have to.

31:24.696 --> 31:27.966
Look, if you're not one of them,

31:27.966 --> 31:30.802
it's just 'cause stuff didn't
just get handed to you.

31:30.802 --> 31:32.237
It didn't.

31:32.237 --> 31:33.939
Right, and when it's like that,

31:33.939 --> 31:38.210
sometimes, to survive...

31:38.210 --> 31:42.981
you have to show some teeth.

31:42.981 --> 31:47.185
And I'm guessing that
yours are pretty sharp.

31:57.028 --> 31:59.564
I'm glad we met,
glad we're friends.

31:59.564 --> 32:01.965
For the love of Christ.

32:09.064 --> 32:11.533
Joe?
I know that voice.

32:11.533 --> 32:14.069
Joe Goldberg?

32:14.069 --> 32:16.639
Maddie Johnson.
I'm Candace's friend.

32:16.639 --> 32:19.108
Great, a little soon
for you to hear this, Beck,

32:19.108 --> 32:20.276
but here we go.

32:20.276 --> 32:22.544
Wow, Maddie, that's crazy.

32:22.544 --> 32:24.046
It's so good to see you.

32:24.046 --> 32:25.347
This is Beck.

32:25.347 --> 32:27.683
Hey.

32:27.683 --> 32:30.920
So I heard about
you and Candace.

32:30.920 --> 32:32.821
You know, I thought
we were pretty happy,

32:32.821 --> 32:36.425
but she thought she could be
happier with some guy in Rome.

32:36.425 --> 32:39.295
So you know, I get it.
She's following her bliss.

32:39.295 --> 32:42.498
It's just how she left
so suddenly.

32:44.533 --> 32:46.101
I mean, we were all
kind of hurt.

32:46.101 --> 32:48.904
Would you excuse us?
My Uber is here.

32:48.904 --> 32:50.205
It was nice to meet you.

32:50.205 --> 32:53.475
Sorry. It was good
to see you, Maddie.

32:56.278 --> 33:00.015
I just felt like that
needed to be over.

33:00.015 --> 33:03.218
Let's get you home.

33:07.923 --> 33:09.458
Be here for Paco.

33:09.458 --> 33:12.328
What could he possibly
need from me?

33:12.328 --> 33:14.730
He needs someone who isn't
drunk, Ron, how about that?

33:18.600 --> 33:21.937
What the hell is wrong
with you, punching a wall?

33:21.937 --> 33:24.974
Solve our problems.

33:24.974 --> 33:27.309
I'm sorry.

33:27.309 --> 33:28.310
It's okay.

33:28.310 --> 33:29.878
It's not okay to yell.

33:29.878 --> 33:31.747
Grown-ups do it all the time.

33:31.747 --> 33:32.848
Grown-ups are assholes.

33:34.817 --> 33:38.320
Some people used to
yell at me, too, you know.

33:39.455 --> 33:42.791
And I don't want to
be like them.

33:42.791 --> 33:44.093
I got you something.

33:55.404 --> 33:59.441
I can't take this in the house.

33:59.441 --> 34:00.442
Ron.

34:04.380 --> 34:05.981
So all the bathrooms
in the building

34:05.981 --> 34:07.583
have the same kind of ceiling.

34:07.583 --> 34:09.485
So go in the bathroom.

34:09.485 --> 34:13.589
The ceiling tiles around
the vent move if you push them.

34:13.589 --> 34:15.657
So you push one...

34:15.657 --> 34:20.228
Pop the book in there,
slide it closed.

34:20.228 --> 34:22.630
Like a secret hiding place.

34:22.630 --> 34:24.766
Cool.

34:24.766 --> 34:26.568
Thank you.

34:26.568 --> 34:29.038
Mm-hmm.

34:29.038 --> 34:31.672
Have a good night, Paco.

34:34.009 --> 34:36.945
If you want it, it's here.

34:50.458 --> 34:53.328
You are not responsible
for my feelings,

34:53.328 --> 34:55.831
I am, but for the record,

34:55.831 --> 35:00.469
I feel like congealed, day-old
egg rolls right about now.

35:00.469 --> 35:03.739
What was the point of
taking me to that party?

35:03.739 --> 35:05.607
Benji was right.

35:05.607 --> 35:06.909
Benji!

35:26.762 --> 35:28.864
Honestly, I get how he feels.

35:28.864 --> 35:31.100
You left me here to die!

35:31.100 --> 35:32.835
You left me here to die!

35:36.238 --> 35:39.541
Enough of this, just kill me!

35:52.087 --> 35:55.324
Hi.

35:55.324 --> 35:57.593
I...

35:57.593 --> 36:01.096
I just... I want to ask you
to please reconsider.

36:01.096 --> 36:04.800
I need the T.A. job.

36:04.800 --> 36:07.236
I need housing.

36:07.236 --> 36:11.306
Can we maybe discuss placing
me with another adviser?

36:12.341 --> 36:14.042
It's the middle of the term.

36:14.042 --> 36:16.845
I know.

36:16.845 --> 36:19.348
Inconvenient, but it's...

36:19.348 --> 36:22.184
It's really important.

36:22.184 --> 36:24.486
I wish you the best.

36:24.486 --> 36:27.990
But I really can't,
in good conscience, do that.

36:27.990 --> 36:31.193
I understand.

36:43.739 --> 36:45.607
So I...

36:45.607 --> 36:48.677
I guess I'm realizing
I have no choice...

36:56.385 --> 36:59.254
But to share this.

37:01.757 --> 37:04.226
And that is?

37:04.226 --> 37:07.362
Well, it can fit in one tweet.

37:07.362 --> 37:10.232
A list of six women who
have a story about you.

37:10.232 --> 37:12.801
Not hard to find,
didn't take much asking around.

37:12.801 --> 37:13.902
What's the term again,

37:13.902 --> 37:16.205
harassment or misconduct?

37:16.205 --> 37:17.839
Anyway, they were too scared
to come forward,

37:17.839 --> 37:21.710
but then we realized it's
harder to dismiss seven women

37:21.710 --> 37:23.545
with the same story.

37:23.545 --> 37:26.448
That's not possible.

37:26.448 --> 37:27.849
I've done nothing inappropriate.

37:27.849 --> 37:30.352
You want to make yourself
a public liar?

37:30.352 --> 37:32.854
That actually would
sink your career.

37:32.854 --> 37:35.924
Blackmail is not something
you live down.

37:39.094 --> 37:40.495
You're trying to call my bluff,

37:40.495 --> 37:43.031
but I'm not bluffing.

37:43.031 --> 37:45.867
So your call.

37:52.407 --> 37:55.043
I've had a lot of time
to think in here.

37:55.043 --> 37:58.146
You're right.

37:58.146 --> 38:02.484
I am a fraud.

38:02.484 --> 38:07.022
I've done things worse than you.

38:07.022 --> 38:10.058
And that's how I know, Joe,

38:10.058 --> 38:11.827
you're not a killer.

38:16.398 --> 38:19.868
I want to tell you something.

38:19.868 --> 38:22.070
And once I tell you,

38:22.070 --> 38:24.039
I'll know your worst secret.

38:24.039 --> 38:27.442
You'll know mine.

38:27.442 --> 38:30.912
Then you can let me go.

38:40.379 --> 38:42.314
Yeah! We thought
this group was strong.

38:42.314 --> 38:45.351
A lot of interesting stuff
in Benji's nightstand.

38:45.351 --> 38:47.052
But he was right.

38:47.052 --> 38:50.089
The thumb drive is by far
the most interesting.

38:50.089 --> 38:53.025
It started out your standard
issue frat hazing,

38:53.025 --> 38:56.395
but a certain intensity
kicked in.

38:57.830 --> 39:00.433
Then the coke or the homophobia.

39:00.433 --> 39:01.700
Teach this bitch a lesson.

39:01.700 --> 39:03.102
Teach him a lesson!

39:03.102 --> 39:04.470
They all stood there,

39:04.470 --> 39:06.372
laughing.

39:06.372 --> 39:08.207
And Benji...
Whoo!

39:08.207 --> 39:10.476
Was the worst
because he stood there

39:10.476 --> 39:11.844
holding the camera.

39:11.844 --> 39:13.813
Dumbass, wake up, dumbass!

39:15.381 --> 39:17.550
Oh, shit!

39:17.550 --> 39:19.018
Their parents made it go away,

39:19.018 --> 39:21.987
but Benji kept
a copy of the video,

39:21.987 --> 39:23.823
I assume, to hold over
friends' heads.

39:23.823 --> 39:26.759
Instead, I get to hold it
over Benji's.

39:26.759 --> 39:28.494
And he doesn't deserve it,

39:28.494 --> 39:30.629
but he's right.

39:30.629 --> 39:33.432
It is enough to buy his freedom.

39:43.175 --> 39:45.578
Should I have changed
the subject on that balcony,

39:45.578 --> 39:47.279
tried to kiss you sooner?

39:47.279 --> 39:49.915
It's not fair how easy it is
to kill a spark.

39:49.915 --> 39:52.151
It's a miracle
love ever happens.

39:52.151 --> 39:53.285
If it's not a myth.

39:53.285 --> 39:55.221
Hi.

39:55.221 --> 39:59.658
Thanks to you, I showed
that professor some teeth.

40:01.360 --> 40:04.029
And?

40:05.831 --> 40:06.665
What's that?

40:06.665 --> 40:09.134
A thank-you doughnut.

40:09.134 --> 40:10.569
It worked.

40:10.569 --> 40:12.671
Hmm.

40:12.671 --> 40:14.440
That's good. I'm glad.
I mean, I was worried.

40:14.440 --> 40:16.475
You were right
and I have housing

40:16.475 --> 40:17.743
and can rip Peach's check up

40:17.743 --> 40:21.580
and generally live
to fight another day.

40:21.580 --> 40:24.283
And I wouldn't have
had the guts if you hadn't...

40:24.283 --> 40:26.218
So really, thank you.

40:26.218 --> 40:28.854
All I want to do is help, Beck.

40:28.854 --> 40:31.724
I mean, you saw something in me

40:31.724 --> 40:34.627
and, God, not everyone
gets why I'm here

40:34.627 --> 40:36.228
and what being a writer means.

40:36.228 --> 40:38.531
It's the most... I mean, it's
the only important thing.

40:38.531 --> 40:43.802
And... and you helped me
to not lose it.

40:45.971 --> 40:49.842
Aren't you gonna look, see if
I guessed the right flavor?

40:53.979 --> 40:56.949
No bullshit, classic,
even old-school,

40:56.949 --> 40:58.584
and secretly better than
all those crazy,

40:58.584 --> 41:00.886
trying-too-hard ones.

41:02.855 --> 41:05.824
It is nice to be seen.

41:05.824 --> 41:07.326
It's a good guess.

41:11.163 --> 41:12.765
It's good.

41:25.578 --> 41:27.112
Come back here.

41:39.558 --> 41:43.429
So plain glazed, yes.

41:43.429 --> 41:46.031
Noted.

41:47.666 --> 41:49.368
I have to go to class.

41:49.368 --> 41:51.537
Have a good class, Beck.

42:14.460 --> 42:17.029
Did you get it?
The video?

42:18.731 --> 42:20.699
Maple latte, almond milk,

42:20.699 --> 42:23.936
two stevia,
did I get that right?

42:23.936 --> 42:27.406
Yeah, yeah, I saw the video.

42:27.406 --> 42:30.442
Yes! Yes!

42:30.442 --> 42:31.543
Yes!

42:34.813 --> 42:38.784
Oh, mutually assured destruction.

42:38.784 --> 42:40.619
Let's talk about something first, though.

42:40.619 --> 42:42.788
What you said about Beck

42:42.788 --> 42:45.324
basically being a gold digger...

42:45.324 --> 42:48.494
I was just being honest,
that's... that's all.

42:48.494 --> 42:49.895
What you are is wrong.

42:49.895 --> 42:51.897
I'd go so far as to say

42:51.897 --> 42:54.800
you create the problem

42:54.800 --> 42:56.835
when you assume this stuff,

42:56.835 --> 42:59.605
when you treat her like trash.

42:59.605 --> 43:03.108
You cast her in a role

43:03.108 --> 43:05.911
that isn't her and...
And you trap her in it.

43:05.911 --> 43:08.914
Bro, I'm... I'm...
I'm done with her.

43:08.914 --> 43:12.384
Say I can trust you.

43:12.384 --> 43:13.786
I've got the video, right?

43:13.786 --> 43:16.989
I mean, solid maybe.

43:16.989 --> 43:19.525
The thing is that doesn't make
up for the damage you've done.

43:19.525 --> 43:20.759
I'm sorry.

43:20.759 --> 43:22.061
If it was between
me and you, Benji,

43:22.061 --> 43:24.296
honestly, I would roll the dice.

43:24.296 --> 43:25.631
I would.

43:25.631 --> 43:27.933
Like you said, I'm not a killer.

43:30.369 --> 43:33.539
But this...

43:33.539 --> 43:34.940
is about her.

43:34.940 --> 43:37.176
I'm telling... you...

43:38.210 --> 43:39.745
I'm scared.

43:39.745 --> 43:42.281
I'm very scared of what
you would do to her.

43:45.818 --> 43:47.419
Maple almond latte.

43:50.222 --> 43:52.024
Two stevia,

43:52.024 --> 43:54.560
two tablespoons of peanut oil.

43:58.964 --> 44:00.733
Could have gone either way.

44:00.733 --> 44:02.835
He's lied about so many things.

44:02.835 --> 44:05.637
Who knew the peanut allergy was real?

44:19.351 --> 44:22.888
Guess Benji's gonna die
an honest man.
