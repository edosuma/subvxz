WEBVTT

00:20.200 --> 00:22.168
I'm gonna suck on your toes.

00:22.202 --> 00:25.205
Do it.

00:27.240 --> 00:28.675
Oh, my God!

00:28.709 --> 00:29.275
What?

00:30.476 --> 00:31.612
Oh, stop.

00:31.645 --> 00:33.346
Skiing is rough on the feet.

00:33.379 --> 00:34.681
Skiing?! It looks like

00:34.715 --> 00:37.117
these things got caught
in the gears of a clock.

00:37.150 --> 00:39.185
This is crazy.

00:39.219 --> 00:41.354
I was just about
to let you rawdog me

00:41.387 --> 00:43.523
on my bar
with my foot in your mouth.

00:43.556 --> 00:46.026
Yeah, the foot part's
not happening.

00:46.059 --> 00:47.393
Neither is the other part.

00:47.427 --> 00:48.962
What? I've had enough drunken,

00:48.995 --> 00:50.964
sloppy hookups
to last me a lifetime.

00:50.997 --> 00:52.532
Oh, so the stories about sex

00:52.565 --> 00:54.567
in the Winter Olympic
Village are true?

00:54.601 --> 00:56.536
It's like a rap video
from the '90s,

00:56.569 --> 00:59.706
except everyone's pale
and has pins in their legs.

00:59.740 --> 01:02.042
Listen, I'm going up
to my cabin later today.

01:02.075 --> 01:05.078
If we're gonna do this,
let's do it right.

01:06.079 --> 01:07.648
I'll pick you up at 5:00.

01:07.681 --> 01:10.183
Okay.

01:11.584 --> 01:13.553
Oh, hey, um, don't knock.

01:13.586 --> 01:15.055
I'll just meet you outside.

01:15.088 --> 01:16.322
It's my roommate.

01:16.356 --> 01:17.758
Shh. I get it.

01:56.396 --> 01:57.798
Tall Nathan called.

01:57.831 --> 01:59.165
They're renting my room.

01:59.199 --> 02:00.934
I have to clear out my stuff
this week.

02:00.967 --> 02:02.836
Are you okay?

02:02.869 --> 02:04.437
Yeah, I guess.

02:04.470 --> 02:06.673
You've been great
about letting me crash with you,

02:06.707 --> 02:09.542
but it's time
to get my own place.

02:09.574 --> 02:11.544
Wow, it's so sad.

02:11.577 --> 02:13.980
I'm 33, and I'm excited

02:14.014 --> 02:16.382
about living in a shitty studio
in Koreatown.

02:16.416 --> 02:18.785
What are you doing?

02:18.819 --> 02:20.486
I'm trying to forge a connection

02:20.520 --> 02:22.388
with each audience
member beforehand.

02:23.824 --> 02:25.091
Oh, you're not doing a bit.

02:26.259 --> 02:28.528
I really hope he likes the show.

02:28.561 --> 02:30.964
He saw a bad production of
Caucasian Chalk Circle once.

02:30.997 --> 02:32.966
It ruined his entire summer.

02:32.999 --> 02:34.968
Hey.

02:35.001 --> 02:36.402
You get to be selfish today.

02:36.436 --> 02:38.404
I know, but...

02:38.438 --> 02:40.406
this is the first chance

02:40.440 --> 02:42.675
for Jimmy to see me
as something else.

02:42.709 --> 02:44.477
Improv is the only
thing I've ever done

02:44.510 --> 02:45.979
that I've been really proud of.

02:46.012 --> 02:47.180
What about Iraq?

02:47.213 --> 02:49.482
One night after a bunch
of us went drinking,

02:49.515 --> 02:51.584
we came across these
locals playing Mheibes.

02:51.617 --> 02:53.787
Okay, well, have a good show!

02:57.123 --> 02:59.092
Hi.

02:59.125 --> 03:01.494
Shh. These decals are
tricky to apply straight.

03:01.527 --> 03:04.330
You should have seen the
mess I made of the dolphin.

03:04.364 --> 03:07.433
It looked like a
scene from The Cove.

03:07.467 --> 03:09.435
The other night, I almost died.

03:09.469 --> 03:11.437
Uh-huh.

03:11.471 --> 03:13.173
As I stood there,

03:13.206 --> 03:16.709
cold steel pressed
against the side of my head,

03:16.743 --> 03:19.512
seconds from oblivion... Well...

03:19.545 --> 03:21.782
a traumatic event like that

03:21.815 --> 03:24.684
makes you reevaluate
your relationships.

03:24.717 --> 03:27.087
So...

03:27.120 --> 03:29.689
here.

03:29.722 --> 03:32.092
What is that? The key

03:32.125 --> 03:34.527
to the Tuppermans' house.

03:34.560 --> 03:35.896
You used to babysit for them.

03:35.929 --> 03:37.430
Where did you find this?

03:37.463 --> 03:40.066
I was desperate for a place to
make out with Kenny Van Dzingel,

03:40.100 --> 03:42.402
so I stole their key
from your room.

03:42.435 --> 03:43.469
You got me fired!

03:43.503 --> 03:44.537
Mom took away

03:44.570 --> 03:46.139
my Tamagotchi!

03:46.172 --> 03:49.042
It starved to death, Lindsay.
Starved!

03:49.075 --> 03:50.543
I've been such a bad sister.

03:50.576 --> 03:52.645
I am so, so,

03:52.678 --> 03:53.914
so sorry.

03:53.947 --> 03:56.983
I want to be better
to everyone, especially you.

03:57.017 --> 03:59.352
I love you.

04:00.453 --> 04:02.588
Oh! What?

04:02.622 --> 04:06.392
I guess the baby loves the
sound of you apologizing. Feel.

04:06.426 --> 04:09.896
Now, while you're
on an apology tour,

04:09.930 --> 04:13.399
have you apologized to Paul for
dragging things out for so long?

04:13.433 --> 04:16.435
I can't. It's too hard. Hey.

04:16.469 --> 04:18.338
You bravely apologized to me

04:18.370 --> 04:20.240
for how you've been
a totally really

04:20.273 --> 04:22.408
shitty sister
for our entire lives.

04:22.442 --> 04:25.511
If you can do that,
you can let go of Paul.

04:27.547 --> 04:29.015
You never told me.

04:29.049 --> 04:31.451
Am I gonna be an aunt
or an uncle?

04:31.484 --> 04:33.920
No, Linds, you-you...

04:33.954 --> 04:36.022
The doctor wrote it
down in this envelope.

04:36.056 --> 04:39.025
Oh. We're saving the reveal
for the big baby shower.

04:39.059 --> 04:40.827
We don't even know.

04:40.861 --> 04:43.964
But from the length of my mucus,
I do have a guess.

04:43.997 --> 04:46.032
Can you not talk about mucus?

04:46.066 --> 04:48.701
I just had a lot of very
questionable yogurt toppings.

05:01.214 --> 05:05.251
I thought you were staying
at Lindsay's indefinitely.

05:06.319 --> 05:08.321
Do you want to talk?

05:10.756 --> 05:13.459
Okay. Well, judging from
the things you said last time,

05:13.493 --> 05:15.896
I'm assuming
you didn't come for me.

05:17.697 --> 05:19.732
Unless you did.

05:19.765 --> 05:22.969
Which is something you could
confirm or deny right now

05:23.003 --> 05:24.971
with a grunt.

05:25.005 --> 05:27.740
Or a twitch, really.

05:29.509 --> 05:31.511
Gretchen?

05:34.780 --> 05:36.983
Do you know what?

05:37.017 --> 05:39.652
You are being dramatic
and self-pitying,

05:39.685 --> 05:41.021
and, frankly, it's unbecoming.

05:41.054 --> 05:42.755
Just snap out of it.

05:42.788 --> 05:44.257
Just stop it, Gretchen. Just...

05:44.290 --> 05:47.393
Stop it!

05:49.195 --> 05:51.164
So that's it, is it?

05:51.197 --> 05:52.865
You're done?

05:52.899 --> 05:54.500
Well, fine.

05:54.534 --> 05:56.336
I'm leaving town for a few days.

06:01.374 --> 06:03.376
This is ridiculous!

06:03.409 --> 06:06.179
If you don't want me to talk
to you, why did you return?

06:12.152 --> 06:14.054
Are you not even
slightly curious

06:14.087 --> 06:16.022
where I might be going, hmm?

06:16.056 --> 06:18.124
'Cause you wouldn't like it.

06:18.158 --> 06:20.026
Not at all.

06:22.062 --> 06:24.364
All right, now you've really
cheesed me off.

06:24.397 --> 06:26.967
This is my house!
I'm not going anywhere.

06:30.403 --> 06:31.771
No!

06:31.804 --> 06:33.706
Not reading any more texts.

06:33.739 --> 06:36.542
In fact, I'm gonna block you.

06:36.576 --> 06:40.046
And in doing so, I've
inadvertently read your text.

06:40.080 --> 06:42.148
I did not think this out
properly.

06:42.182 --> 06:43.549
Well, that's the last one.

06:43.583 --> 06:44.917
If you want to communicate,

06:44.951 --> 06:47.453
then you can just talk to me
with your dumb mouth.

06:58.764 --> 07:01.567
What are you doing?

07:01.601 --> 07:02.644
If you're not gonna talk to me,

07:02.668 --> 07:04.237
then you can talk
to your friends.

07:04.270 --> 07:06.839
Your contacts make no sense.

07:06.872 --> 07:09.475
"Weird cummer?"
"Racist but hot?"

07:09.509 --> 07:12.178
Eight that just say,
"Do not answer."

07:12.212 --> 07:14.014
Henry Rollins?

07:14.047 --> 07:16.682
Don't call him.
Don't call anyone.

07:16.716 --> 07:19.019
Well, then get up and stop me.

07:30.563 --> 07:32.165
Dang. That's spooky.

07:32.198 --> 07:34.034
She's just staring at nothing.

07:34.067 --> 07:37.070
Just like one of
them Peaky Blinders.

07:38.738 --> 07:41.141
Okay, I haven't watched it yet.

07:41.174 --> 07:43.509
Jaclyn got us watching Rectify.

07:43.543 --> 07:45.078
Oh, yeah, yeah.

07:48.181 --> 07:50.216
I don't know.

07:50.250 --> 07:52.652
I'm sorry I gave you scabies.

07:52.685 --> 07:56.022
I'm sorry I left you alone
at that party with Moby.

07:56.056 --> 07:57.890
Your mother didn't needlessly
and recklessly

07:57.923 --> 07:59.392
vaccinate you, did she?

07:59.425 --> 08:00.393
Want to hear a joke?

08:00.426 --> 08:02.295
I know exactly how you feel.

08:02.328 --> 08:05.198
It's like, what's the point
of it all?

08:05.231 --> 08:07.200
I, uh...

08:07.233 --> 08:09.069
I forgot my joke.

08:09.102 --> 08:13.306
I have this friend, Kasia,
who was in the dumps, too.

08:13.339 --> 08:16.842
She was sleeping in an abandoned
apartment in Novokuznetsk,

08:16.876 --> 08:20.080
living off potato water
and Ukrainian candy, but...

08:20.113 --> 08:21.714
you should see her now.

08:24.284 --> 08:25.651
Some of the most
legendary geniuses

08:25.685 --> 08:27.153
of our time suffer
from depression.

08:27.187 --> 08:30.756
David Foster Wallace, Hemingway,
Spalding Grey,

08:30.790 --> 08:32.792
Boner from Growing Pains.

08:34.427 --> 08:36.395
What?!

08:36.429 --> 08:38.398
Seriously? Mm-hmm.

08:38.431 --> 08:40.765
- All of them?
- All of them.

08:40.799 --> 08:42.735
My dad looks
just like you do right now.

08:42.768 --> 08:45.438
Last week, he didn't come out
of his room for three days,

08:45.471 --> 08:47.240
so I had a mustard sandwich
for dinner.

08:47.273 --> 08:49.842
And so that's why I founded
my anti-vaccine group.

08:49.875 --> 08:52.578
Because I realized I really have
to give back, you know?

08:52.612 --> 08:54.580
And, also, it's just not
about me anymore.

08:54.614 --> 08:57.450
And, also, can you imagine
how hard my life would be

08:57.483 --> 08:58.951
if my baby came out...?

08:58.984 --> 09:01.354
I'm sorry. During
The Rock of Love auditions,

09:01.387 --> 09:03.723
I called you
a "poor man's Isla Fischer."

09:03.756 --> 09:06.259
"Oh, great,
they opened a pudding stand

09:06.292 --> 09:09.229
next to the taxidermy school."

09:09.262 --> 09:11.297
Who cares?

09:11.331 --> 09:13.065
Now she drives an Alpina.

09:13.099 --> 09:15.135
I only drive a seven series!

09:15.168 --> 09:17.237
She's got a gold Apple watch!

09:18.504 --> 09:20.573
That heartless,
tyrannical bitch.

09:20.606 --> 09:22.208
Even Boner?

09:22.242 --> 09:25.278
Even Boner.

09:25.311 --> 09:26.746
It ain't even real acting.

09:26.779 --> 09:28.881
You just be, like,
"Yeah, my car broke down."

09:28.914 --> 09:31.984
Then you nut a dude or two
while they drive the van around,

09:32.017 --> 09:34.954
and they give you,
like, 65 bucks!

09:34.987 --> 09:36.789
Free money, basically.

09:36.822 --> 09:38.891
What if we, like,
just got a group together

09:38.924 --> 09:42.395
and went to the Ace,
Palm Springs?

09:42.428 --> 09:44.397
Lexi won't care.

09:44.430 --> 09:47.933
Plus... I have
a separate credit card.

09:47.967 --> 09:50.670
My dad gave it to me
for emergencies.

09:50.703 --> 09:52.405
I guess I'm not exactly sure

09:52.438 --> 09:54.174
what I'm supposed
to be doing here.

09:54.207 --> 09:55.775
And I'm sorry

09:55.808 --> 09:57.943
about that one time
we were camping,

09:57.977 --> 10:02.014
and I told you a bear pooped
in your sleeping bag.

10:02.047 --> 10:04.049
There was no bear.

10:09.054 --> 10:12.525
Thank you for coming
to the 101 class show

10:12.558 --> 10:14.694
for our baby improvisers.

10:14.727 --> 10:16.429
We know
that there are other things

10:16.462 --> 10:19.532
that you could be doing
at 3:00 p.m. on a Wednesday,

10:19.565 --> 10:21.167
like working...

10:21.201 --> 10:22.702
or watching Maury Povich,

10:22.735 --> 10:28.040
masturbating, masturbating
while watching Maury Povich.

10:28.073 --> 10:30.676
I like when they're not the dad,
and then they immediately

10:30.710 --> 10:32.721
jump into the audience and start
high-fiving everyone.

10:32.745 --> 10:36.549
And then, the mom's, like,
"No, I thought he was the dad!"

10:36.582 --> 10:40.353
Anyway,
please welcome our 101 class!

10:40.386 --> 10:42.555
Oh, babies!

10:52.765 --> 10:55.201
All right, all right, we're
starting with speed scenes.

10:55.235 --> 10:57.203
I need a location. Yell it out.

10:57.237 --> 10:58.471
Train station!

10:58.504 --> 11:00.506
I heard "train station."

11:02.742 --> 11:05.177
Oh, gee, I hope the
train comes soon.

11:05.211 --> 11:08.581
I can't wait to get to my
job at the bomb factory.

11:08.614 --> 11:10.416
Extra! Extra! Japan surrenders.

11:10.450 --> 11:11.984
The war is over! Ha.

11:12.017 --> 11:14.086
Oops. Well, back to
the kitchen for me.

11:20.460 --> 11:22.595
Wow. That is offensive.

11:22.628 --> 11:25.765
I am totally not blind.

11:33.072 --> 11:35.174
Hey, yo, watch it!

11:35.207 --> 11:37.443
I'm a baby over here!

11:37.477 --> 11:39.545
Oh!

11:39.579 --> 11:41.281
Hey, yo, Bill. Yeah, Carl?

11:41.314 --> 11:43.249
I think it's really cool

11:43.283 --> 11:45.084
when the lady feeds me
from her boob, ya know?

11:45.117 --> 11:46.986
Yeah, I like that, too.

11:48.821 --> 11:50.590
Aw, yeah.

11:50.623 --> 11:53.426
I just pooped myself.

11:53.459 --> 11:54.827
Noyce.

11:58.931 --> 12:03.135
Uh, oh, oh...

12:03.168 --> 12:04.470
Oh...

12:07.573 --> 12:09.074
Thank you all so much!

12:09.108 --> 12:11.477
Thank you so much for coming.

12:11.511 --> 12:13.646
Please stick around
for beer and wine in the lobby.

12:13.679 --> 12:14.780
What?

12:14.814 --> 12:15.981
I'm not the father?

12:16.015 --> 12:17.650
Yeah!

12:21.987 --> 12:23.155
Yes!

12:23.188 --> 12:24.557
Yes!

12:24.590 --> 12:26.225
Oh, yes! Yes!

12:26.258 --> 12:28.193
Yes!

12:32.832 --> 12:35.134
That was great!

12:44.877 --> 12:45.845
Yeah!

12:48.881 --> 12:52.151
Your chicken-wing is improving
by leaps and bounds.

12:52.184 --> 12:53.319
I've got a good teacher.

12:56.622 --> 12:58.023
Oh, zorp!

12:58.057 --> 12:59.825
The parking meter's almost out.

12:59.859 --> 13:01.327
I'll be back in a jiff.

13:01.361 --> 13:03.663
Then I want a mancala rematch.

13:03.696 --> 13:06.366
Oh, someone's a glutton
for punishment.

13:12.037 --> 13:13.839
Oh. Let me
ask you something.

13:13.873 --> 13:16.476
Do you really love Paul?

13:16.509 --> 13:18.511
I-I feel for you.

13:18.544 --> 13:20.179
You had the perfect man

13:20.212 --> 13:22.482
and you didn't appreciate him.

13:22.515 --> 13:24.450
But to answer your question,

13:24.484 --> 13:25.718
yes.

13:25.751 --> 13:27.219
I do love him.

13:27.252 --> 13:29.522
Unequivocally,
to the end of the galaxy...

13:29.555 --> 13:31.791
which is ever-expanding,

13:31.824 --> 13:34.293
so, technically,
not an actual place, but...

13:34.326 --> 13:36.396
You just talked back to me.

13:36.429 --> 13:37.797
Never do it again.

13:37.830 --> 13:39.064
But that's good.

13:39.098 --> 13:41.033
Paul needs someone
who can defend him.

13:41.066 --> 13:43.035
He's kind of a marshmallow.

13:43.068 --> 13:46.071
And that's the difference
between you and me:

13:46.105 --> 13:47.573
I love that about him.

13:50.610 --> 13:52.211
Here.

13:52.244 --> 13:53.413
I signed them.

13:56.382 --> 13:57.583
He's yours.

13:57.617 --> 13:59.351
Wow.

13:59.385 --> 14:01.186
Thanks.

14:01.220 --> 14:03.656
Why... why are they sticky?

14:03.689 --> 14:04.924
Take care of him, okay?

14:04.957 --> 14:06.325
Make sure he puts on

14:06.358 --> 14:07.893
that super-tight sweatshirt

14:07.927 --> 14:09.695
if there's a thunderstorm.

14:09.729 --> 14:11.697
The pressure
reduces his anxiety.

14:11.731 --> 14:13.232
I know.

14:20.205 --> 14:22.708
That's for stealing my husband.

14:40.159 --> 14:41.927
Relationships are tough, Jimmy.

14:41.961 --> 14:43.729
My mom has a new boyfriend.

14:43.763 --> 14:45.130
My dad won't stop crying.

14:45.164 --> 14:46.632
He's been playing
"Hurdy Gurdy Man"

14:46.666 --> 14:47.800
on repeat for days.

14:47.833 --> 14:48.801
It's really scary.

14:48.834 --> 14:49.935
Oh, that's good to hear.

14:49.969 --> 14:51.136
Go away.

14:57.777 --> 14:58.911
You're erect!

14:58.944 --> 15:00.646
That's amazing.

15:00.680 --> 15:02.982
I can't say it again.

15:03.015 --> 15:04.016
I can't.

15:05.250 --> 15:09.254
I just still can't understand.

15:09.288 --> 15:13.459
Can you... can you
explain it to me, please?

15:14.960 --> 15:18.664
I'm... scraped out.

15:18.698 --> 15:22.234
I'm that car we sent to Mars,

15:22.267 --> 15:26.138
flipped upside-down so the sun
can't reach my solar panels.

15:27.507 --> 15:29.141
I've always been able

15:29.174 --> 15:32.945
to flip myself back over
eventually, but...

15:32.978 --> 15:35.147
I ran out of times.

15:36.482 --> 15:39.952
This is how I am now.

15:41.286 --> 15:44.123
And it's not okay with you.

15:44.156 --> 15:46.358
Nor should it be.

15:46.391 --> 15:49.461
Okay.

15:49.495 --> 15:52.632
Well, um...

15:52.665 --> 15:55.134
I suppose it's-it's good
that this happened now,

15:55.167 --> 15:58.370
instead of, I don't know, like,
ten years down the line.

16:02.007 --> 16:03.543
Yeah.

16:05.344 --> 16:08.280
I'll be back
in a couple of days.

16:08.313 --> 16:12.117
I'll be out
by the time you get back.

16:12.151 --> 16:14.386
Have fun.

16:14.419 --> 16:16.989
You deserve it.

16:17.022 --> 16:19.058
Whoever she is.

17:35.434 --> 17:36.969
I couldn't find you!

17:37.002 --> 17:38.070
That was so good.

17:38.103 --> 17:39.238
Didn't that feel good?

17:39.271 --> 17:40.481
Oh, my God, your steroid
accountant character

17:40.505 --> 17:41.974
was hysterical.

17:42.007 --> 17:44.109
Who just lets someone sit

17:44.143 --> 17:46.578
in someone else's reserved seat?

17:46.612 --> 17:49.081
They give them up as soon as
the show starts, you know that.

17:49.114 --> 17:50.315
All I know is

17:50.349 --> 17:52.384
when you think someone's
here supporting you

17:52.417 --> 17:54.253
and then they're not,

17:54.286 --> 17:55.587
it feels really bad.

17:55.621 --> 17:57.723
I hate that Jimmy ruined
that great show for you.

17:57.757 --> 17:58.958
That sucks.

17:58.991 --> 18:01.426
I just thought we were
getting to a new place.

18:01.460 --> 18:03.595
He sees me with a girlfriend,

18:03.629 --> 18:05.998
a job, a new passion...

18:06.031 --> 18:08.934
But... clearly I was wrong.

18:08.968 --> 18:10.936
He still just thinks of me

18:10.970 --> 18:13.605
as a freeloading veteran
with perfect features.

18:13.639 --> 18:16.108
Hey, you need
to concentrate on you.

18:16.141 --> 18:17.476
On what's next for Edgar.

18:19.044 --> 18:23.148
And I hope whatever's next
for Edgar has me in it.

18:24.483 --> 18:26.351
Hey, I have to go look at
this new apartment.

18:26.385 --> 18:28.129
You want to come with me
and then go to the diner?

18:28.153 --> 18:29.421
Yes.

18:29.454 --> 18:31.523
Have you ever dipped fries
into a milk shake?

18:31.556 --> 18:32.692
Sounds weird.

18:32.725 --> 18:33.725
Oh...

18:54.313 --> 18:56.315
Mother...!

19:09.862 --> 19:10.863
Hello.

19:54.073 --> 19:55.707
The bedroom is small,

19:55.741 --> 19:57.685
but it's not like I'm going
to do CrossFit in there.

19:57.709 --> 19:59.620
And, Edgar, there's a little
window in the closet.

19:59.644 --> 20:01.713
And I love the floors.

20:01.747 --> 20:02.948
Yuck to the kitchen,

20:02.982 --> 20:04.784
but it's got a view.

20:04.817 --> 20:06.551
I've never had a view before.

20:06.585 --> 20:09.221
Dang, I wish it was $400 less.

20:09.254 --> 20:10.289
You love it.

20:10.322 --> 20:11.857
I love it.

20:11.891 --> 20:13.058
Then you should live here.

20:13.092 --> 20:14.193
I can't afford it.

20:14.226 --> 20:16.295
At this point,
it's just a fantasy.

20:16.328 --> 20:19.131
But maybe someday,

20:19.164 --> 20:21.133
if I pick up a few extra
classes...

20:22.167 --> 20:24.103
We could split it.

20:26.939 --> 20:28.307
What are you talking about?

20:28.340 --> 20:30.409
What do you... what do you
think I'm talking about?

20:32.011 --> 20:34.446
Living together.

20:34.479 --> 20:37.216
But that's crazy.

20:37.249 --> 20:38.250
Right?

20:39.518 --> 20:40.685
You're serious?

20:43.789 --> 20:45.590
Could we get furniture

20:45.624 --> 20:47.993
that's not just trash
from off the street?

20:48.027 --> 20:49.962
We could do that.

20:49.995 --> 20:51.563
So, for real?

20:51.596 --> 20:52.932
You want to do this?

20:54.533 --> 20:55.667
For real.

20:55.700 --> 20:58.503
You want to live with me!

21:24.663 --> 21:25.697
You stayed?

21:25.730 --> 21:27.799
Yeah.

21:30.135 --> 21:32.137
You stayed.

22:00.099 --> 22:01.333
Farts.

22:53.318 --> 22:56.221
A fantasy
league is like a family...

22:56.255 --> 22:57.589
Said no one ever.

22:57.622 --> 23:00.259
I have achieved more
than I ever thought possible...

23:00.292 --> 23:02.794
A checking account,
unlimited texting.

23:02.827 --> 23:05.730
Win or lose, it's how
you play your friends.

23:05.764 --> 23:09.201
Do I have any regrets?
Yeah. Tony Romo.

23:09.234 --> 23:13.072
History is not written by the winners.
It's written by the cheaters.

23:13.105 --> 23:16.141
My mother always wondered,
how low can you go?

23:16.175 --> 23:17.742
Well, Mom, pretty low.

23:17.776 --> 23:20.545

Ew. Bro.

23:41.266 --> 23:42.734
Oh, God!

23:42.767 --> 23:43.945
Do you hear that chirping sound?

23:43.969 --> 23:45.337
Aaah!

23:45.370 --> 23:46.838
What the hell am I looking at?

23:46.871 --> 23:48.607
Hello!

23:48.640 --> 23:49.908
Oh!

23:51.376 --> 23:53.345
No!

23:53.378 --> 23:55.347
We're mainlining wine.
It's not beer.

23:55.380 --> 23:57.292
We can't mainline beer because
it's got bubbles in it.

23:57.316 --> 23:58.783
We tried. It was bad.

Holy...

24:11.330 --> 24:13.498
What are you
looking for exactly?

24:19.538 --> 24:21.640
Why not get
surgically conjoined?

24:29.314 --> 24:31.650
- We do not have that.
- Pepsi Lime.

24:31.683 --> 24:33.518
- We have Coke.
- New or Classic?

24:33.552 --> 24:36.155
- Just regular Coke.
- Okay. Schweppes then.

24:36.188 --> 24:37.689
Did you say "Schweppes"?

24:37.722 --> 24:39.458
Schweppes! Schweppes!

24:39.491 --> 24:43.328
- Sorry. I heard two people.
- Schweppes! I said Schweppes!

24:44.763 --> 24:46.331
Don't have it.
