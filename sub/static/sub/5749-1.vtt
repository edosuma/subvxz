00:43.168 --> 00:46.672
~ Suntan lotion is good for me

00:46.797 --> 00:48.549
~ You protect me

00:48.674 --> 00:50.384
~ Tee-hee-hee

00:51.760 --> 00:57.140
Oh, the sun tries to burn me,
but you won't let it, will ya?

00:58.725 --> 01:03.146
Ultraviolet rays - bad. Lotion - good.

01:03.272 --> 01:05.315
(blows raspberries )

01:07.484 --> 01:09.528
Smiley.

01:17.828 --> 01:21.915
There's something important
I was supposed to do today.

01:22.040 --> 01:24.418
Have five daiquiris?

01:24.585 --> 01:27.462
No, you remembered to do that.

01:28.589 --> 01:32.259
Man, why did I have so many drinks?
I can't remember.

01:33.427 --> 01:36.597
- What's today?
- October?

01:37.556 --> 01:40.309
It's nudie-magazine day!

01:41.226 --> 01:43.270
Yeah!

01:53.280 --> 01:55.324
Watch out, butler!

01:55.449 --> 01:57.492
Ooh, you're a quick one.

02:08.128 --> 02:11.215
Nudie-magazine day!
Nudie-magazine day!

02:11.757 --> 02:14.051
Nudie-magazine day! Nudie...

02:14.218 --> 02:16.261
Agh! Ooh!

02:38.700 --> 02:40.744
Ooh.

02:41.203 --> 02:42.371
Eee...

02:45.457 --> 02:47.501
Ah!

02:48.710 --> 02:50.754
Oh!

02:54.508 --> 02:56.552
(squawking )

03:00.389 --> 03:02.432
Holy jeez!

03:02.599 --> 03:07.646
Lookee what we got here.
That silly penguin is back again.

03:07.813 --> 03:11.400
No, Mr Madison, there no penguin.
You got too much sun today.

03:11.567 --> 03:14.361
- There no penguin!
- (squawks )

03:14.486 --> 03:19.199
It's too damn hot for a penguin
to be just walkin' around here.

03:20.868 --> 03:24.037
I gotta send him back to the South Pole.

03:25.789 --> 03:27.833
No!

03:36.884 --> 03:41.180
Penguin! Don't you dare run away!

03:42.347 --> 03:45.184
Come here, Mr Penguin!

03:46.602 --> 03:48.729
I'm one of the good guys, penguin.

03:48.854 --> 03:51.857
Don't run! Oh. Oh...

04:02.659 --> 04:05.204
Don't run!

04:05.329 --> 04:08.165
Don't run from me!

04:08.332 --> 04:10.375
Penguin!

04:14.963 --> 04:15.881
Penguin.

04:22.679 --> 04:25.599
You're a bad penguin.

04:26.183 --> 04:27.726
Whee-hee!

04:27.851 --> 04:29.728
Call the zoo!

04:33.315 --> 04:38.195
All the people at the zoo
are very nice, penguin.

04:38.320 --> 04:41.823
They'll treat you real respectable, like.

04:43.242 --> 04:46.411
There's nothing to worry about, big fella.

04:48.330 --> 04:50.207
Here I come!

04:58.131 --> 05:02.261
Right this way, gentlemen.
Mr Madison is expecting you.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.474
Leg.

05:09.935 --> 05:15.274
Billy! You shouldn't pull that crap in front
of your father's business associates.

05:15.399 --> 05:19.152
Now you get yourself upstairs
and get ready. Dinner's in 15 minutes.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.613
- Yeah, yeah.
- Don't ''yeah, yeah'' me, boy.

05:21.738 --> 05:24.908
This is a very important dinner.
You best be there.

05:25.075 --> 05:28.161
I will. Thank you, Juanita.

05:28.871 --> 05:32.374
You gotta dress yourself up
and look nice, too.

05:32.499 --> 05:36.170
Oh, that boy's a fine
piece of work all right.

05:37.629 --> 05:40.299
He's a fine piece of ass though, too.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.975
Where the hell is he? I'm starvin'.

05:50.100 --> 05:54.396
I ate some Triscuit crackers in the car.
You should've had some.

05:54.563 --> 05:57.399
If you'd told me
there were Triscuit crackers,...

05:57.524 --> 06:00.110
- ..I could've enjoyed them with you.
- I'm sorry.

06:00.277 --> 06:03.906
Sorry doesn't put the Triscuit crackers
in my stomach, does it, Carl?

06:04.072 --> 06:07.743
Gentlemen?
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.

06:07.910 --> 06:12.873
Have you all met?
Eric Gordon, my executive vice president.

06:12.998 --> 06:17.711
And our operations manager Carl Alphonse.
Sit down, gentlemen, sit down.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.838
Beautiful table.

06:19.963 --> 06:22.007
Good seeing you, sir.

06:25.469 --> 06:27.888
Where's Billy?

06:29.431 --> 06:32.100
Juanita said he'd be down
in a few minutes.

06:32.226 --> 06:35.062
I'm sure you'll all be very impressed.

06:35.187 --> 06:39.900
Shampoo is better.
I go on first and clean the hair.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.361
Conditioner is better.

06:42.528 --> 06:45.864
I leave the hair silky and smooth.

06:46.031 --> 06:48.450
Oh, really, fool? Really!

06:52.621 --> 06:54.665
Stop looking at me, swan.

07:06.051 --> 07:08.220
(slurps )

07:20.107 --> 07:22.442
- Hey, Carl, what's up?
- Nothing much, Billy.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.945
- I see you got a little sun today.
- You think so?

07:25.112 --> 07:29.950
- I fell asleep by the pool for a few hours.
- Did you fall asleep or did you pass out?

07:31.952 --> 07:34.204
Shut up!

07:34.371 --> 07:38.834
That's enough, Billy. Because you took
your sweet-ass time coming down here,...

07:38.959 --> 07:41.170
..these gentlemen will miss their flights.

07:41.336 --> 07:45.174
Well, this guy can stay in my room,
I'll tell you that much.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.349
Billy? Eat your soup.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.768
It's good soup.

07:58.145 --> 08:01.315
Gentlemen, I can't thank you enough
for coming this evening.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.901
(yells gibberish )

08:04.067 --> 08:07.404
Please, Billy, please,
no gibberish tonight, please. I beg you.

08:07.571 --> 08:09.573
Sorry, Daddy.

08:10.407 --> 08:14.536
This is a big night for me tonight, gents.
I have an important announcement.

08:14.703 --> 08:16.955
(fast gibberish )

08:17.122 --> 08:20.209
That's it, Billy! Get the hell outta here!

08:22.461 --> 08:24.755
(slow gibberish )

08:33.013 --> 08:36.975
- Nice talkin' to you, Billy.
- (singsong gibberish )

08:38.101 --> 08:39.937
(yells )

08:49.446 --> 08:51.448
Right. One, two, three!

08:54.076 --> 08:56.995
Hey, Billy, how come
you ain't poundin' any tonight?

08:57.120 --> 09:01.416
I don't know. My dad was yellin' at me.
I'm just not in the mood.

09:02.876 --> 09:08.549
Hey, Billy, who would you rather bone,
Meg Ryan or Jack Nicholson?

09:08.715 --> 09:12.511
Jack Nicholson now, or 197 4?

09:12.678 --> 09:14.680
'7 4.

09:16.098 --> 09:18.308
- Meg Ryan.
- Go.

09:18.475 --> 09:21.311
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

09:24.481 --> 09:26.733
Oh, my God! I am the winner!

09:26.900 --> 09:30.487
- Billy is not an idiot.
- I'm not saying he's an idiot.

09:30.654 --> 09:35.242
I just think he might not be mature
enough to run a Fortune 500 company.

09:36.326 --> 09:39.162
My late wife Emily and I
started this company...

09:39.288 --> 09:42.416
..with a 15-unit motel
in Patchogue, Long Island.

09:42.583 --> 09:45.043
We built it into 650 hotels.

09:45.210 --> 09:50.048
Our dream was to one day
turn it over to our only son Billy.

09:50.215 --> 09:53.677
- How many people work for Madison?
- 61,000 and change.

09:53.844 --> 09:59.600
How long will they have jobs once Billy
has the hotel operator speaking gibberish?

10:06.315 --> 10:08.192
Oh, Billy, Billy boy.

10:08.358 --> 10:12.070
When are you gonna find
whatever it is you're lookin' for?

10:12.237 --> 10:14.656
Here's a nice piece of shit.

10:20.787 --> 10:24.666
My, oh, my. Wait till old man Clemens
realises it's a bag of shit.

10:24.833 --> 10:27.878
He's gonna shit when he realises it's shit.

10:28.045 --> 10:30.589
Who got the lighter?

10:30.756 --> 10:32.758
Come on.

10:41.266 --> 10:43.268
Light it.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.650
(rings doorbell)

10:52.194 --> 10:54.696
Oh, my God! Old man Clemens hates shit!

10:54.863 --> 10:56.448
Shh. Here he comes!

10:56.615 --> 10:58.784
Who the hell is it? What do you want?

10:58.951 --> 11:01.745
Judas Priest, Barbara!
One of those flaming bags again!

11:01.912 --> 11:04.581
(Barbara ) Don't put it out
with your boots, Ted.

11:04.748 --> 11:07.042
Don't tell me my business, devil woman.

11:07.376 --> 11:10.921
Call the fire department.
This one's outta control(!)

11:15.092 --> 11:17.094
(sniffs )

11:19.888 --> 11:21.598
It's poop again!

11:21.723 --> 11:24.184
He called the shit ''poop''!

11:25.227 --> 11:28.021
This is the best night of my life!

11:28.146 --> 11:33.026
I'll get you damn kids for this!
You're all gonna die!

11:35.946 --> 11:38.657
Billy, could you step in here
for a moment?

11:38.824 --> 11:41.076
I have big news.

11:41.243 --> 11:45.164
Eric is pregnant! Congratulations, Dippy!

11:45.289 --> 11:48.917
Feel those kicks!
He's gonna be a soccer player. He is.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.670
He is.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.801
All right, what's up?

11:57.968 --> 12:00.470
I've had to face
some hard truths tonight, Billy.

12:00.596 --> 12:03.182
Do we have to do this
with Captain Dipshit here?

12:03.307 --> 12:07.269
You were brought up with
every advantage. I bought you everything.

12:07.394 --> 12:10.272
Toys, cars, vacations, clothes...

12:10.397 --> 12:12.858
Actually, I stole this shirt from Frank.

12:12.983 --> 12:17.070
Yeah, well, whatever.
It's all my fault. I made a mistake.

12:17.196 --> 12:20.991
Jeez, what...?
Are you some damned moron?

12:21.116 --> 12:23.577
Can't you just stop for two seconds?

12:23.702 --> 12:27.039
I'm trying to tell you that I'm retiring,
and Eric, not you,...

12:27.164 --> 12:29.833
- ..is gonna take over Madison Hotels.
- Eric?!

12:30.334 --> 12:34.254
You're gonna give the company to Eric?
He is a bad, bad man!

12:34.379 --> 12:39.301
What do you care, Billy? What do you care
who I appoint to run the company, huh?

12:39.426 --> 12:43.889
I mean, I'm doin' you a favour.
You don't ever have to look for a job.

12:44.014 --> 12:49.102
You can sit around all day, goofing off,
sipping drinks, chasing invisible penguins.

12:49.561 --> 12:52.898
Is that it, Dad?
Did the penguin tell you to do this?

12:53.023 --> 12:55.150
- Penguin?
- What an idiot.

12:55.275 --> 12:58.153
You know, I could help Billy
until he gets the hang of it.

12:58.278 --> 13:02.950
I think crazy Carl is right. I mean,
I can do this if I set my mind to it.

13:03.075 --> 13:05.536
High school was a pain in the ass,
but I graduated.

13:05.661 --> 13:08.705
Because I paid your teachers
to give you decent grades.

13:08.831 --> 13:11.875
I've regretted it every day since.
I thought at the time...

13:12.000 --> 13:15.546
..if you could get good grades,
you might get into a good college...

13:15.671 --> 13:18.715
- ..and straighten yourself out.
- I don't believe that.

13:18.841 --> 13:22.177
Well, what do you believe?
That you were an honours student?

13:22.302 --> 13:27.683
How could I hand over my company to someone who
couldn't even get through school on his own?

13:27.808 --> 13:31.311
I don't know. Don't think about it.
Just hand it over.

13:33.355 --> 13:35.399
Forget it.

13:37.234 --> 13:40.988
Well, listen, don't you think you better
go to bed? Big day tomorrow.

13:41.113 --> 13:45.868
A day filled with daiquiris
and Nintendos and jack-off magazines...

13:48.495 --> 13:50.539
Dad!

13:51.373 --> 13:52.708
Yeah, what?

13:52.833 --> 13:55.669
Give me one more chance.
I'll prove I can take over.

13:55.794 --> 14:00.382
I'll do anything it takes. I'll go back
to high school and take the exams again.

14:00.507 --> 14:05.637
- I'll get my diploma all by myself.
- Billy, Billy, it wasn't just high school.

14:05.762 --> 14:08.473
Remember that spelling bee
you won in the first grade?

14:08.599 --> 14:11.518
- No, you didn't.
- Rock.

14:11.643 --> 14:14.021
R-o-k.

14:14.146 --> 14:16.899
Yeah? So what's your point?

14:17.024 --> 14:20.444
- R-o-c-k!
- The C is silent.

14:21.737 --> 14:23.906
OK, all right.

14:24.031 --> 14:28.619
All right, you got it. First grade
through 12th grade all over again.

14:29.536 --> 14:34.124
I'll do each grade in two weeks,
take the tests, regraduate,...

14:34.249 --> 14:40.047
..prove to you I'm not an idiot, and then
I get to take over Madison Hotels.

14:40.172 --> 14:42.216
That's some idea.

14:43.258 --> 14:46.803
- You just think of that?
- Yeah, I did. It's pretty good, huh?

14:48.096 --> 14:51.183
Brian, don't you think
the future of Madison Hotels...

14:51.308 --> 14:56.021
..and its 61,000 employees is too
important to gamble on a game like this?

14:56.146 --> 14:58.190
No.

14:59.525 --> 15:02.361
You're on.
Carl, you make the arrangements.

15:03.487 --> 15:08.784
You pass every grade before June 15
and you take over instead of Eric.

15:10.244 --> 15:14.748
Have a nice weekend, son.
You start school on Monday.

15:15.249 --> 15:16.458
Oh!

15:16.583 --> 15:18.627
Give 'em hell, Bill.

15:20.879 --> 15:25.217
Nice try, asswipe.
But you're just delaying the inevitable.

15:29.096 --> 15:31.765
(~ 'I'll Tumble 4 Ya' by Culture Club )

15:33.350 --> 15:37.437
~ Downtown we'll drown,
we're in our never splendour

15:37.563 --> 15:39.731
~ Flowers, showers

15:39.857 --> 15:42.109
~ Who's got the new boy gender?

15:42.234 --> 15:45.737
~ I'll be your baby, I'll be your score

15:46.363 --> 15:49.366
~ I'll run the gun for you
and so much more

15:49.491 --> 15:51.118
~ I'll tumble for ya

15:51.618 --> 15:53.245
~ I'll tumble for ya

15:53.745 --> 15:57.875
~ I'll tumble for ya, I'll tumble for you

15:58.000 --> 15:59.418
~ I'll tumble for ya

16:00.127 --> 16:01.712
~ I'll tumble for ya

16:02.254 --> 16:05.299
~ I'll tumble for ya, I'll tumble

16:09.553 --> 16:13.473
~ I get a crazy feeling
that chases in my head

16:13.599 --> 16:17.311
~ It's nothing that you do to me,
it's nothing that you said

16:17.811 --> 16:19.605
Where's my Snack Pack?

16:19.730 --> 16:22.441
You've got a banana.
You don't need no Snack Pack.

16:22.566 --> 16:26.069
You know I like Snack Pack.
Why can't you give me a Snack Pack?!

16:26.195 --> 16:28.614
I thought I was your Snack Pack.

16:28.739 --> 16:30.991
- What are you talkin' about?
- Nothin'.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.785
Bill, you're gonna miss the bus.

16:33.911 --> 16:36.872
Yeah, you better get
your beautiful buns up that driveway.

16:36.997 --> 16:39.416
- What a weirdo!
- (Juanita laughs )

16:42.294 --> 16:44.963
~ Oh, back to school

16:45.088 --> 16:46.673
~ Back to school

16:46.798 --> 16:50.761
~ To prove to Dad that I'm not a fool

16:50.886 --> 16:54.139
~ I got my lunch packed up

16:54.264 --> 16:56.099
~ My boots tied tight

16:56.225 --> 16:59.561
~ I hope I don't get in a fight

17:00.145 --> 17:02.564
~ Oh, back to school

17:02.689 --> 17:06.443
~ Back to school, back to school...

17:09.988 --> 17:12.449
Well, here goes nothin'.

17:30.843 --> 17:32.886
Thank you, Daddy.

17:47.985 --> 17:49.945
- Hi. How you doin'?
- Fine.

17:50.070 --> 17:52.155
Are you going to class today, too?

17:52.281 --> 17:54.992
I'll be going to class to teach.
How about you?

17:55.284 --> 17:57.619
I'll be going to learn.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.706
Ah. You must be Billy Madison.

18:00.831 --> 18:02.082
Yes, I am.

18:02.207 --> 18:06.628
Don't you think it's pathetic that because
of your father you get to do school again?

18:06.920 --> 18:09.673
- Yes, I do.
- Well, as long as you know.

18:09.798 --> 18:11.842
Well, all right!

18:18.724 --> 18:20.767
(bell rings )

18:26.732 --> 18:28.775
(children shrieking )

18:32.863 --> 18:35.199
Hey, mister,
guess what I had for breakfast.

18:35.324 --> 18:37.367
- What?
- Beans.

18:42.623 --> 18:45.542
Scotty likes beans, don't you, Scotty?

18:46.919 --> 18:50.297
- Hey. How you doin'?
- Let's involve the class.

18:50.422 --> 18:52.883
Quiet down, my special people.

18:55.511 --> 18:57.763
I want you all to meet...

18:57.888 --> 19:00.557
..our new friend Billy.

19:00.682 --> 19:04.853
- Can everyone say hello to Billy?
- Hello, Billy.

19:04.978 --> 19:06.605
Hi.

19:06.730 --> 19:11.026
Billy is going to be sharing our fun
and learning for the next two weeks.

19:11.151 --> 19:15.364
Billy is special,
just like each and every one of you.

19:15.948 --> 19:19.034
And what do we do to our special people?

19:26.208 --> 19:28.252
All right. All right.

19:31.880 --> 19:34.925
Billy, why don't you take a seat
right up front here?

19:35.050 --> 19:38.762
And we can start story time.

19:40.013 --> 19:42.057
You got a misshaped head.

19:42.182 --> 19:44.226
Thank you.

19:48.438 --> 19:52.985
The Puppy Who Lost His Way
by Chrissy Taylor.

19:54.611 --> 19:57.030
''One fine morning...

19:57.155 --> 20:03.036
..a puppy popped his puppy paws
out of his puppy house.''

20:03.162 --> 20:05.914
''This was no ordinary puppy.''

20:06.039 --> 20:11.211
''This puppy was the happiest puppy
in the whole world.''

20:11.336 --> 20:17.718
''In fact, his name was Happy.
Happy looked through the bushes...''

20:17.843 --> 20:22.014
'''I'll never let you get lost again',
cried the little boy,...

20:22.139 --> 20:26.059
..who was so happy
that he gave Happy a kiss...

20:26.185 --> 20:29.062
..on his wet little puppy nose.''

20:30.063 --> 20:32.357
''The end.''

20:32.482 --> 20:37.029
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Miss Lippy.
The part of the story I don't like...

20:37.154 --> 20:40.741
..is that the little boy gave up
looking for Happy after an hour.

20:40.866 --> 20:45.704
He didn't put posters up. He just sat
on the porch like a goon and waited.

20:45.829 --> 20:50.292
That little boy's gotta think:
you got a pet, you got a responsibility.

20:50.417 --> 20:54.129
If your dog gets lost, you don't look
for an hour then call it quits.

20:54.254 --> 20:58.050
You get your ass out there
and you find that fuckin' dog!

21:01.470 --> 21:05.599
I think it's time to play dodge ball.

21:21.657 --> 21:24.117
You're out! O'Doyle rules!

21:31.792 --> 21:34.044
(sitar music )

21:47.307 --> 21:49.726
Billy. What are you doing back?

21:49.852 --> 21:51.895
I'm out.

21:52.980 --> 21:57.734
Well, that just means you stay
off to the side until a new game starts.

21:57.860 --> 22:01.947
That's OK. I'm kinda tired anyway.
I'll just sit here and colour or something.

22:02.072 --> 22:06.451
Billy, dodge-ball time is a special time.

22:06.577 --> 22:11.832
Not just for you boys and girls,
but for Miss Lippy, too. So stay outside.

22:23.427 --> 22:25.345
(children ) Whoa!

22:25.470 --> 22:28.557
Now you're all in big, big trouble.

22:29.266 --> 22:31.935
(~ 'Beat on the Brat' by the Ramones )

22:40.152 --> 22:41.737
You're out!

22:41.862 --> 22:43.614
Oh, yeah!

22:48.243 --> 22:49.536
(bell rings )

22:49.661 --> 22:51.330
Lunchtime!

22:58.587 --> 23:01.256
I bet that Snack Pack's pretty good.

23:03.717 --> 23:06.970
Wanna trade me the rest of it
for this banana?

23:08.388 --> 23:11.308
You know how badly I can beat you, right?

23:14.436 --> 23:18.148
Mortal Kombat on Sega Genesis
is the best video game ever.

23:18.273 --> 23:22.694
I disagree. It's a very good game, but I
think Donkey Kong is the best game ever.

23:22.819 --> 23:26.532
- Donkey Kong sucks.
- You know somethin'? You suck.

23:28.617 --> 23:31.537
~ Number one, number one

23:31.662 --> 23:34.248
~ Now my song has just begun

23:34.373 --> 23:37.709
~ With a rum tum taddelum,
Old John Braddelum

23:37.835 --> 23:40.796
~ Hey, what country folk we be

23:44.216 --> 23:47.261
~ Number two, number two

23:47.386 --> 23:50.013
~ Roosters crow,
cock-a-doodle-doodle-doo

23:50.138 --> 23:53.600
~ With a rum tum taddelum,
Old John Braddelum

23:53.725 --> 23:57.020
~ Hey, what countryfolk we be

24:00.232 --> 24:03.068
~ Number three, number three

24:03.193 --> 24:05.612
~ I like you and you like me

24:18.000 --> 24:22.129
Hey! That's very nice of you to pick up
your little brother here at school.

24:22.254 --> 24:24.882
He's not my brother. He's my son.

24:26.049 --> 24:30.179
- You gotta be kiddin' me.
- Mom, that's Billy. He's in my class.

24:30.304 --> 24:32.723
I heard he's retarded or something.

24:33.724 --> 24:35.267
(laughs )

24:35.976 --> 24:39.813
Creative mind. Maybe someday he'll make
Mommy and Daddy a lot of money.

24:39.938 --> 24:44.026
Daddy's in prison, and he won't
be home for a long time.

24:44.151 --> 24:46.195
My dear Lord.

24:46.320 --> 24:50.449
Yeah! Yeah, well, I gotta get goin'
right now. I gotta get on the bus.

24:50.574 --> 24:53.785
I ride the bus for the city
and watch the bus drivers.

24:53.911 --> 24:56.872
This programme to make sure
they turn the wheels right...

24:56.997 --> 24:59.249
Billy, you forgot your stuff.

25:05.839 --> 25:06.965
Come on, honey.

25:07.090 --> 25:09.551
Thank you very much, Miss Lippy!

25:13.680 --> 25:15.557
- (phone rings )
- Yes.

25:15.682 --> 25:20.020
- (secretary ) Brian Madison for you.
- Tell him I'm out to lunch.

25:20.145 --> 25:22.272
Billy Madison.

25:22.397 --> 25:28.237
A buffoon. And yet a threat
to my eventual takeover of this company.

25:28.362 --> 25:31.740
A menace.
And what do we do with a menace?

25:31.865 --> 25:36.286
We eliminate it.
We eliminate Billy Madison.

25:36.411 --> 25:38.914
- Tricia Labonte?
- Here.

25:40.624 --> 25:42.876
- Scotty Logan?
- Here.

25:44.419 --> 25:46.964
- Billy Madison?
- (blows raspberry )

25:48.006 --> 25:50.050
(laughing )

25:59.685 --> 26:00.936
Hm...

26:25.502 --> 26:28.505
Hey. Look at all this milk.

26:28.630 --> 26:32.885
- You want some of this milk?
- That milk belongs to that classroom.

26:33.010 --> 26:36.722
Oh. They don't gots to know about it.
It could be our milk.

26:36.847 --> 26:39.725
No milk will ever be our milk.

26:40.601 --> 26:42.644
Ooh. That wasn't very nice.

26:42.769 --> 26:46.190
How 'bout you, sideburns?
You want some of this milk?

26:46.315 --> 26:47.941
Rather have a beer.

27:21.016 --> 27:24.394
I drew the duck blue because
I've never seen a blue duck before...

27:24.520 --> 27:27.606
..and, to be honest with ya,
I wanted to see a blue duck.

27:27.898 --> 27:30.984
Well, it's an excellent blue duck.

27:31.109 --> 27:35.072
Congratulations.
You just passed the first grade.

27:35.197 --> 27:37.950
Oh, Miss Lippy, that's so great.

27:38.075 --> 27:40.202
What do you think of that, Mr Blue Duck?

27:40.327 --> 27:42.788
That's quack-tastic!

27:46.166 --> 27:48.627
Wow! Look at all that candy!

27:49.586 --> 27:51.296
Rolex!

27:54.508 --> 27:58.428
- Thanks for the watch, Billy.
- You're welcome, buddy.

27:58.554 --> 28:04.393
This is great. When I graduated first grade
all my father did was tell me to get a job.

28:04.518 --> 28:05.519
(braying )

28:05.644 --> 28:09.523
Hey, you wanna feed that donkey
some beer, get it all messed up?

28:09.648 --> 28:13.443
- Maybe later.
- I'll go put some beer in a bucket.

28:13.569 --> 28:17.072
- OK.
- Hey there, Mr Graduate. How's it goin'?

28:17.197 --> 28:19.241
(Eric ) Go!

28:22.578 --> 28:25.247
Come on, kid! Get up! Get up!

28:25.372 --> 28:27.958
You're humiliating yourself! Get up!

28:30.544 --> 28:32.588
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

28:35.674 --> 28:37.384
Aaah!

28:53.192 --> 28:57.237
So he's passed first grade and
he's moved on to second. Whoop-de-do.

28:57.362 --> 28:59.698
Any more information, Rollo?

29:04.036 --> 29:06.246
Billy likes to drink soda.

29:09.625 --> 29:12.669
Miss Lippy's car is green.

29:15.631 --> 29:18.717
And now we have just two students left.

29:20.719 --> 29:22.554
Bath.

29:22.930 --> 29:25.057
Bath.

29:25.182 --> 29:29.645
B-a-t-h.

29:29.770 --> 29:31.980
- Bath.
- Correct!

29:32.105 --> 29:36.360
Bath - that's a little easy.
Why don't you just give her the trophy?

29:37.528 --> 29:39.154
Cheese.

29:41.156 --> 29:42.199
Cheese.

29:42.449 --> 29:49.456
C-h-e-e-s-e.

29:49.581 --> 29:51.875
- Cheese.
- Correct.

29:53.502 --> 29:56.630
- Couch.
- Couch.

29:58.799 --> 30:00.175
C...

30:00.300 --> 30:03.554
C-o...

30:04.680 --> 30:06.974
- W?
- No!

30:07.307 --> 30:10.185
No, I'm sorry, that's not right.

30:10.310 --> 30:11.979
(laughs )

30:12.104 --> 30:16.066
Well, Billy, if you spell this correctly,
you pass second grade.

30:18.443 --> 30:19.778
Couch.

30:19.903 --> 30:21.947
C...

30:22.698 --> 30:24.324
Cou...

30:24.741 --> 30:26.326
Cou...

30:27.411 --> 30:29.454
C-o...

30:30.539 --> 30:34.668
R... Are you going to the mall later?
That's what I'm asking.

30:34.793 --> 30:38.380
No, I am not going to the mall.
Keep spelling, mister.

30:39.381 --> 30:41.425
C-o-u...

30:43.218 --> 30:45.345
..c-h?

30:46.555 --> 30:48.473
Correct!

30:48.599 --> 30:51.685
I am the smartest man alive!

30:53.103 --> 30:55.647
(squealing )

30:57.858 --> 31:01.278
Is he gonna have a stupid party
every time he passes a grade?

31:02.029 --> 31:04.364
(Carl) Everybody's having
a good time but you.

31:04.490 --> 31:06.950
Spoilt snot. Get outta here.

31:07.951 --> 31:12.956
Let me ask you something, Carl.
You started here, what, 25 years ago?

31:13.081 --> 31:15.667
Night bellboy at the Philadelphia Madison?

31:15.792 --> 31:21.381
After all your hard work, how would you
feel working for some punk kid like Billy?

31:22.049 --> 31:23.884
Could be worse.

31:27.262 --> 31:28.555
That's nice.

31:31.391 --> 31:34.228
Man, I'm so nervous.
First and second grade were easy,...

31:34.353 --> 31:38.398
..but social studies, division?
This is gonna be tough.

31:40.359 --> 31:43.195
Man, I'm so nervous.
First and second grade were easy,...

31:43.320 --> 31:46.198
..but social studies, division?
This is gonna be tough.

31:46.323 --> 31:48.534
Relax, dude.

31:49.660 --> 31:51.119
Jackpot.

31:51.245 --> 31:55.624
- Good morning, class.
- Good morning, Miss Vaughn.

31:55.749 --> 32:00.921
We're gonna start today by reading
a short story entitled ''My Sister Fanny''.

32:01.046 --> 32:03.006
Quiet.

32:03.131 --> 32:07.386
OK, so let's all open up
our Reading is Fun books to page 69.

32:07.511 --> 32:09.555
69!

32:12.266 --> 32:15.102
Class, say hello to Billy Madison.

32:15.227 --> 32:18.564
Hello, Billy Madison.

32:18.689 --> 32:21.608
Billy is a nuisance.
He will be gone in two weeks.

32:21.733 --> 32:24.820
I apologise for this inconvenience.

32:25.612 --> 32:28.866
- Jeez! What's up her butt?
- What was that, Billy?

32:28.991 --> 32:32.077
I said ''Reading is good.''

32:32.202 --> 32:34.663
Can we start the story now?

32:37.040 --> 32:39.084
Dan, you may begin.

32:39.960 --> 32:41.628
''O... o... once...

32:41.753 --> 32:44.631
..th... th... there w... was...

32:44.756 --> 32:47.301
..a g... g... girl...

32:47.426 --> 32:49.511
..who w...''

32:49.636 --> 32:51.847
- He can't even read.
- Cut it out, dude.

32:51.972 --> 32:54.433
You're gonna get us in trouble.

32:55.225 --> 32:57.853
''..p... p... p... p...''

32:57.978 --> 33:00.063
T... t... t... today, junior!

33:10.240 --> 33:13.285
Ow! You're tearing my ear off!

33:13.410 --> 33:18.248
Making fun of a kid for trying to read.
Are you psycho? Do you not have a soul?

33:18.373 --> 33:21.919
I'm sorry. I can't hear you.
I've been physically abused in the ear.

33:22.044 --> 33:27.007
Keep your mouth shut for the next two
weeks or I'm gonna fail you. End of story.

33:27.132 --> 33:31.887
I see your lips movin', but I can't
make out your words. I'm deaf.

33:33.514 --> 33:36.892
Oh, Veronica Vaughn. So hot.

33:37.017 --> 33:39.228
Want to touch the heinie.

33:39.353 --> 33:41.230
(howls )

33:41.355 --> 33:45.150
So that girlie I've been chasin'?
Turns out she's my third-grade teacher.

33:45.275 --> 33:47.820
First thing she does
is kick me out of her class.

33:47.945 --> 33:50.864
Maybe she feels she has
to make an example of you.

33:50.989 --> 33:54.076
- Or she's got somethin' up her ass.
- That's what I said.

33:54.201 --> 33:56.703
- Poor Billy.
- I'm so depressed.

33:57.579 --> 34:00.165
- Want me to take my shirt off for you?
- No, thank you.

34:00.290 --> 34:03.961
OK, baby. But remember,
the offer is on the table.

34:05.754 --> 34:09.633
Oh, yes. Oh, my.

34:09.758 --> 34:11.844
Oh, God, yes.

34:11.969 --> 34:14.221
- Lordy.
- Billy Madison.

34:14.346 --> 34:15.472
Uh-huh?

34:15.597 --> 34:19.852
Would you like to try writing some words
in cursive on the blackboard today?

34:19.977 --> 34:22.020
OK. Sure.

34:28.944 --> 34:30.988
OK, how about the word ''dugout''?

34:41.540 --> 34:43.876
OK, good. How about ''bunt''?

34:52.926 --> 34:56.305
Bunt. B-u-n-t.

34:56.430 --> 35:00.893
In perfect cursive.
Any more brain-busters?

35:02.269 --> 35:04.313
Rizzuto.

35:11.069 --> 35:13.113
Z... Z...

35:22.122 --> 35:23.749
Rirruto?

35:24.833 --> 35:27.127
Those are Zs.

35:27.252 --> 35:29.171
They look like Rs to me.

35:29.296 --> 35:34.635
That's not fair! Rizzuto is not a word.
He's a baseball player. You're cheating.

35:34.760 --> 35:37.137
Would you like to try the word ''buzz''?

35:37.262 --> 35:39.264
(children laugh )

35:39.389 --> 35:42.226
I hate cursive and I hate all of you!

35:42.351 --> 35:44.853
I'm never comin' back to school! Never!

35:44.978 --> 35:47.272
(children laugh )

35:51.401 --> 35:53.445
(Juanita ) Billy!

36:02.037 --> 36:04.206
I swear, I'm sick. I can't go to school.

36:04.331 --> 36:08.836
If you're gonna stay home today,
you could help me shave my armpits.

36:08.961 --> 36:11.880
Oh, my God! I'll go to school.

36:15.634 --> 36:17.678
O'Doyle rules!

36:24.685 --> 36:29.439
- What's goin' on?
- Miss Vaughn's sick.

36:31.024 --> 36:32.818
(teacher claps )

36:32.943 --> 36:35.612
Please take your seats.

36:36.989 --> 36:40.450
- Who's that guy?
- Principal Anderson.

36:43.704 --> 36:48.709
As you can tell, Miss Vaughn is not feeling
well today, so I'll be taking her place.

36:48.834 --> 36:52.004
But don't get your hopes up,
because I plan on teaching,...

36:52.129 --> 36:54.715
..so I hope you plan on learning.

36:55.382 --> 37:00.304
Now, who can tell me where we are
in our social-studies reader?

37:00.429 --> 37:02.431
Yes?

37:02.556 --> 37:04.141
Michael?

37:04.850 --> 37:07.311
Excuse me. What's that in your hand?

37:09.605 --> 37:11.940
Bring that note up to me.

37:12.065 --> 37:14.401
(class ) Ooh.

37:18.238 --> 37:21.950
Now let's see what couldn't wait
till after class.

37:27.498 --> 37:31.752
''We're so lucky to have
Principal Anderson substituting.''

37:33.003 --> 37:38.175
''Now we have the privilege of staring
at that tub of lard all day long''?

37:39.551 --> 37:44.431
''If I were him, I would walk my fat ass
right into oncoming traffic.''

37:47.935 --> 37:51.480
Oh, man, Billy,
I just thought of the funniest thing.

37:52.231 --> 37:54.274
Billy?

37:55.651 --> 37:59.613
- Where's Billy?
- He's in school, man.

37:59.738 --> 38:00.989
Oh, yeah.

38:22.469 --> 38:25.305
(~ 'I'm Not the One' by the Cars )

38:25.430 --> 38:27.516
~ I'm not the one

38:28.392 --> 38:31.270
~ That you'll be shootin' for

38:31.395 --> 38:33.438
~ I'm not the one

38:34.481 --> 38:36.984
~ Who's coming back for more

38:37.109 --> 38:40.529
~ You know why

38:40.654 --> 38:42.990
~ We've been through this too many times

38:43.115 --> 38:45.993
~ You know why

38:46.118 --> 38:49.580
~ It's never clear it's pantomime

38:52.166 --> 38:56.712
I don't wanna sound like a weirdo,
but I kinda missed Miss Vaughn today.

38:56.837 --> 38:59.756
- Why? Do you like her or something?
- No!

38:59.882 --> 39:02.926
- Why? Did she say she likes me?
- Not to me.

39:03.051 --> 39:05.721
Well, let's find out.

39:17.691 --> 39:20.277
Uh, hello?

39:20.402 --> 39:22.529
Um, is this Miss Vaughn?

39:22.654 --> 39:24.573
Oh, hi. It's Ernie from class.

39:24.698 --> 39:27.618
(whispers ) Ask her if she has a boyfriend.

39:27.743 --> 39:31.246
Uh, Miss Vaughn, do you have a boyfriend?

39:33.332 --> 39:35.125
(whispers ) No.

39:35.751 --> 39:37.419
- Ask her...
- Shh!

39:37.544 --> 39:41.757
Ask her if she likes anybody from class,
like, more than a friend.

39:42.716 --> 39:47.262
Uh, Miss Vaughn, do you like
anybody in class more than a friend?

39:52.017 --> 39:54.061
(whispers ) No.

39:55.062 --> 39:58.273
Ask her if she would ever
go out with somebody from class.

39:58.398 --> 40:00.359
- No!
- Just do it!

40:02.152 --> 40:06.490
Um, Miss Vaughn, would you ever
go out with anybody from class?

40:07.407 --> 40:09.243
Uh-huh.

40:09.993 --> 40:12.162
Uh-huh.

40:12.287 --> 40:15.624
You see, Ernie, grown-ups like
to go out with other grown-ups.

40:15.749 --> 40:19.044
- What about Billy?
- You're more of a grown-up than Billy.

40:19.169 --> 40:21.713
- I'll give you a grown-up.
- What was that, Ernie?

40:21.839 --> 40:26.093
(high-pitched) Nothing.
See you tomorrow in class, Miss Vaughn.

40:26.218 --> 40:28.262
You blew it!

40:33.892 --> 40:38.564
Hey, I dare you to throw
your sandwich at the bus driver.

40:39.022 --> 40:42.025
(children ) Do it. Come on.

40:44.361 --> 40:45.904
Hey!

40:46.029 --> 40:48.490
Hey, who threw that?

40:50.534 --> 40:52.995
I'll turn this damn bus around.

40:53.120 --> 40:57.916
That'll end your precious little
field trip pretty damn quick, huh?

40:59.168 --> 41:01.211
Bullshit.

41:08.051 --> 41:12.181
Hey, I'm tryin' to score points with
the teacher today. Don't screw it up!

41:12.306 --> 41:15.434
I dare you to touch her boobs.

41:15.559 --> 41:18.645
Touch her boobs? That's assault, brother.

41:22.900 --> 41:25.027
Ya double-dare me?

41:31.742 --> 41:34.495
Miss Vaughn, how long till we get there?

41:34.620 --> 41:38.373
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- Probably about two minutes.

41:39.124 --> 41:42.669
Sorry about that.
Damn guy drives like an animal.

41:43.670 --> 41:47.049
That's all right, Billy.
Why don't you go back and sit down now?

41:47.174 --> 41:49.384
- OK.
- I double-dare you.

41:49.510 --> 41:52.095
Da... I... Accident...

41:52.221 --> 41:54.348
Mistake... Tit...

41:54.473 --> 41:56.934
- Go sit down now.
- Yes.

41:57.059 --> 41:59.102
(children giggle )

42:04.066 --> 42:07.778
Yeah, here we go again.
Another treat from the road.

42:07.903 --> 42:11.698
Grand, ripe banana.
Trick of the day. Great...

42:15.994 --> 42:19.540
(woman ) What is a horseshoe?
What does a horseshoe do?

42:19.665 --> 42:21.875
Are there any horse socks?

42:22.000 --> 42:24.044
Is anybody listening to me?

42:24.169 --> 42:27.047
Anyways, I am sorry about
what happened back there,...

42:27.172 --> 42:30.467
..but you have to admit,
I've been tryin' to be good lately.

42:30.592 --> 42:33.929
Well, you're not the first person
that's tried to grab my chest.

42:34.054 --> 42:37.766
I'm trying not to hold you to a higher
standard than the rest of the students.

42:37.891 --> 42:40.644
Although maybe I should.
You are, what, 50?

42:40.769 --> 42:45.774
No, but the other kids look up to me.
I don't want them to think I'm a coward.

42:45.899 --> 42:50.737
Don't worry about it. Next week you're
gonna have another teacher to annoy.

42:50.863 --> 42:55.534
I don't want to annoy another teacher,
Miss Vaughn. I want to annoy you.

42:55.659 --> 42:59.621
- Miss Vaughn!
- Somebody stole all our lunches.

43:00.664 --> 43:02.708
Who would steal 30 bagged lunches?

43:10.507 --> 43:13.051
I'll tell you who took those lunches.

43:13.177 --> 43:15.429
That damn sasquatch.

43:16.597 --> 43:20.726
Well, I guess that's it.
OK, everybody! Back on the bus!

43:20.851 --> 43:24.771
- Hey, what's with Ernie?
- I don't know. I'll be right back.

43:27.274 --> 43:29.318
Hey, Ernie, what's up?

43:30.402 --> 43:32.446
Nothing.

43:33.363 --> 43:37.075
You fallen in love
with the wall or somethin'?

43:37.201 --> 43:40.287
- I had an accident.
- An accident. What does that mean?

43:40.412 --> 43:41.705
Ooh!

43:42.498 --> 43:44.333
Oh, I know. OK. Uh...

43:47.920 --> 43:51.590
Don't worry, buddy. You hang tight.
I'll be right back.

43:59.264 --> 44:02.267
Hey, look, everybody! Billy peed his pants!

44:02.392 --> 44:07.231
Of course I peed my pants. Everybody
my age pees their pants. It's the coolest.

44:07.356 --> 44:09.149
- Really?
- Yes!

44:09.274 --> 44:13.111
You ain't cool unless you pee your pants.

44:13.237 --> 44:16.657
- Wow.
- Hey, man, Ernie peed his pants too.

44:18.200 --> 44:19.785
All right!

44:23.330 --> 44:28.252
If peeing your pants is cool,
consider me Miles Davis.

44:28.377 --> 44:29.628
Oh!

44:29.795 --> 44:34.508
That was the grossest thing
I've ever heard in my life! Let's go!

44:34.633 --> 44:36.927
Get on the bus here.

44:37.052 --> 44:39.179
Move it. Get up there, Kyle.

44:39.304 --> 44:41.431
One, two, five, seven.

44:41.557 --> 44:45.143
Move it or lose it. Get on the b...

44:45.269 --> 44:47.729
Hi, Miss Vaughn. Nice to see ya.

44:55.529 --> 45:00.909
That Veronica Vaughn is one piece of ass.

45:02.035 --> 45:06.373
I know from experience, dude,
if you know what I mean.

45:06.498 --> 45:08.458
No, you don't.

45:08.584 --> 45:13.297
Well, not me personally, but a guy I know.
Him and her got it on.

45:13.422 --> 45:15.465
Whoo-ee!

45:16.091 --> 45:18.343
No, they didn't.

45:18.468 --> 45:20.929
No, no, no, they didn't.

45:21.054 --> 45:24.975
But you can imagine
what it'd be like if they did, right? Huh?

45:31.857 --> 45:35.360
Everybody on?
Good, great, grand, wonderful!

45:36.528 --> 45:39.448
No yelling on the bus!

45:39.573 --> 45:43.410
~ Billy passed the third grade

45:43.535 --> 45:47.539
~ Oh, what a glorious day

45:47.664 --> 45:51.335
~ Oh, passin' third grade

45:51.502 --> 45:55.422
~ The Billy Madison way

45:55.589 --> 45:57.341
Yeah!

45:57.466 --> 45:59.676
Rock on! Yes!

46:10.562 --> 46:12.481
(boy ) Stop it.

46:13.106 --> 46:18.153
Who are you? I don't even know you.
Go away, mister. Stop it.

46:18.278 --> 46:20.322
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

46:24.409 --> 46:27.704
- Look! She came!
- And she came too.

46:45.097 --> 46:47.558
The mucus queen is yours.

46:49.184 --> 46:50.185
Thanks.

46:50.310 --> 46:52.354
Hi!

46:53.564 --> 46:56.859
Oh, gosh. Oh, thank you.

47:01.238 --> 47:02.781
Oh, my God!

47:03.866 --> 47:06.326
Snack Pack! You're the coolest!

47:06.493 --> 47:10.330
- Those should last you the weekend.
- Thank you very much.

47:10.497 --> 47:13.458
- Billy is on the right track.
- He's on track all right.

47:13.584 --> 47:16.253
He's headed right down the toilet.

47:17.963 --> 47:20.007
Easy.

47:21.383 --> 47:23.594
You still don't think he's gonna make it?

47:23.760 --> 47:28.056
Trust me, Carl, baby.
I know he's not gonna make it.

47:28.182 --> 47:30.642
Would you excuse me for a second?

47:33.145 --> 47:36.148
Who will help me destroy Billy Madison?

47:36.273 --> 47:38.317
Who?

47:56.126 --> 48:00.047
You know, that was really sweet,
the way you helped Ernie out yesterday.

48:00.172 --> 48:03.300
He would have done the same for me.

48:03.425 --> 48:06.386
So what's it like being back in school?

48:06.512 --> 48:09.056
I don't know. I kinda feel
like an idiot sometimes.

48:09.223 --> 48:12.309
Although I am an idiot,
so it kinda works out.

48:13.352 --> 48:16.772
Is it just you and your dad in here?

48:16.897 --> 48:21.693
Well, actually, no. There's Juanita,
and some maids and butlers and stuff.

48:21.819 --> 48:24.947
And people who work for my dad
are always stoppin' by.

48:25.072 --> 48:29.493
And my friends are always sleepin' over,
even when I didn't ask 'em to.

48:29.618 --> 48:32.704
- Sounds like a hotel.
- It kinda is. It can be distracting.

48:32.871 --> 48:35.332
That's why I moved out here.

48:47.177 --> 48:49.137
Wow.

48:49.263 --> 48:52.266
This is where I've been spending
most of my time lately.

48:52.432 --> 48:54.893
Not exactly roughing it, are you?

49:00.274 --> 49:03.777
Those are, uh...
They come with the tent, so...

49:09.324 --> 49:13.495
Oh, wow. A Tale of Two Cities.
I don't think we're up to that one yet.

49:13.620 --> 49:17.124
I can understand nine words
in that book now.

49:20.335 --> 49:24.256
So, it's, um... the last day of third grade.

49:25.299 --> 49:29.219
And you have the teacher,
alone, in your tent.

49:30.137 --> 49:32.598
What do you wanna do?

49:33.432 --> 49:37.811
Well, I can think of three things
I'd like to do.

49:37.936 --> 49:42.232
One would involve some ice cubes
and a nine-iron.

49:43.650 --> 49:46.820
- Two would include a buffalo.
- Really?

49:46.987 --> 49:52.326
Live or stuffed.
Preferably stuffed, for safety's sake.

49:52.451 --> 49:55.454
Three: we'd bring back
some of those ice cubes,...

49:55.621 --> 49:58.707
..but switch it over to a pitching wedge.

49:59.500 --> 50:01.960
How you guys doin'?

50:03.420 --> 50:07.090
Hey! Carl! Good to see you!

50:09.927 --> 50:12.471
This is Veronica, my teacher. That's Carl.

50:12.638 --> 50:16.391
Very pleased to meet you.
Bill, I think Eric is up to something.

50:16.558 --> 50:19.311
- Who's Eric?
- He works for my dad too.

50:19.436 --> 50:22.356
He gets the company if I screw up.
He's a douchebag.

50:22.523 --> 50:26.985
He made some menacing comments to me,
and then he did that little weasel laugh.

50:27.152 --> 50:31.281
- Yeah. How does that laugh go again?
- You know. (laughs )

50:32.032 --> 50:34.868
- Very good. It sounded just like him.
- Thanks.

50:34.993 --> 50:37.996
Well, I'm sure he's got
something up his sleeve.

50:38.121 --> 50:39.748
- Thanks, buddy.
- No problem.

of the US is along the eastern seaboard.

That's like taking a census...

You know, yeah. Pick it up and gimme...

52:29.149 --> 52:32.486
Hey, Billy, you wanna go
play soccer with us after school?

52:32.611 --> 52:35.864
No, I got a test on Friday.
I'll play with you guys next week.

52:35.989 --> 52:39.076
- Next week you'll be in ninth grade.
- Yeah, high school.

52:39.201 --> 52:40.327
Oh, yeah.

52:40.494 --> 52:45.207
You aren't gonna wanna hang round with
a bunch of dumb elementary-school kids.

52:45.457 --> 52:48.961
That's not true. I'll come
and visit you guys all the time.

52:49.211 --> 52:51.255
Yeah, to see your girlfriend.

52:51.421 --> 52:53.298
(boys ) Whooo!

52:54.758 --> 52:56.552
(cackling )

52:56.718 --> 53:00.389
Have some more Sloppy Joes.

53:01.765 --> 53:05.018
I made 'em extra sloppy for yous.

53:07.813 --> 53:11.483
I know how yous kids like 'em sloppy.

53:12.609 --> 53:15.028
Lady, you're scarin' us.

53:41.346 --> 53:46.059
- Do you know where the bathroom is?
- Second door on the left.

53:49.688 --> 53:53.400
Hey, tubby, how about
a little bathroom reading?

53:53.567 --> 53:57.196
I have the August 1983 issue
of Wrestling World here.

53:58.447 --> 54:02.659
There's a terrific article about
a wrestler named the Revolting Blob.

54:04.411 --> 54:08.540
Gee, you know somethin'?
He kinda looks like someone I know.

54:09.750 --> 54:12.669
- Where'd you get that?
- I have a subscription.

54:12.836 --> 54:18.425
Bad guy. He threw one opponent out of
the ring and hit a bunch of senior citizens.

54:20.052 --> 54:22.971
Boy, this wacko looks familiar.

54:23.096 --> 54:26.767
What do I care about some
stupid phoney wrestling guy?

54:26.934 --> 54:28.894
My God.

54:29.019 --> 54:33.816
In June 1983 he sat on
some guy's head and killed him.

54:33.982 --> 54:36.109
It was just a stunt!

54:36.276 --> 54:39.655
He was supposed to pinch my leg
if he was running short of air.

54:39.822 --> 54:44.451
With this guy sitting on everyone's head,
I wonder how he got his teaching degree?

54:44.618 --> 54:46.328
No!

54:46.453 --> 54:50.499
No, you can't do that to me.
Those kids are my whole life!

54:50.666 --> 54:55.504
So you wouldn't want anything to happen
that would make 'em think less of you?

54:55.671 --> 54:57.297
Max?

54:58.257 --> 55:00.092
Max?

55:00.259 --> 55:02.427
You ready to cooperate with me?

55:02.594 --> 55:04.471
Yes.

55:04.638 --> 55:07.307
Then Madison Hotels is as good as mine!

55:19.695 --> 55:21.697
(rock music from car )

55:43.719 --> 55:46.138
(laughter )

55:47.931 --> 55:50.100
- (student ) Nice shirt.
- Yeah. Yep.

55:50.267 --> 55:52.269
(bell rings )

55:57.858 --> 56:03.489
Now the cell's happy. But other molecules
are saying ''We'd like some energy too.''

56:03.655 --> 56:09.620
And it uses its own pigment molecule,
chlorophyll, to carry out the action.

56:09.786 --> 56:13.081
This does not make the ribosomes happy.

56:14.374 --> 56:17.252
And poor chlorophyll is caught
in the middle of this.

56:17.419 --> 56:21.006
Chlorophyll? More like ''bore-ophyll''!

56:22.466 --> 56:24.468
Right?

56:27.095 --> 56:31.517
- Jeez, a little bit stuffy in here, huh?
- Don't talk to me.

56:31.683 --> 56:34.353
- And why is that?
- Because you're a loser.

56:34.520 --> 56:38.649
(teacher ) ..from these ribosomes.
And chlorophyll helps the chloroplast...

56:38.774 --> 56:41.068
No, I will not make out with you!

56:42.110 --> 56:45.781
Did you hear that? This girl wants to
make out with me in the middle of class!

56:45.948 --> 56:49.034
You got ''chlorophyll man'' up there
talkin' about God knows what.

56:49.201 --> 56:54.248
All she's talking about is makin' out with
me. I'm here to learn, not to make out.

56:54.414 --> 56:56.625
Go on with the chlorophyll.

57:01.129 --> 57:03.131
O'Doyle rules.

57:03.882 --> 57:06.718
Thanks a lot, O'Doyle. Nice meetin' you.

57:07.761 --> 57:09.763
(giggling )

57:11.265 --> 57:14.142
- Wait till they start with the wedgies.
- Yeah.

57:14.309 --> 57:18.522
You oughta start cutting your underwear
before you get to school. So it rips easier.

57:18.647 --> 57:20.691
I see. Who are you guys?

57:20.858 --> 57:23.777
The guys everybody used to pick on
before you started here.

57:23.944 --> 57:28.782
No, they ain't pickin' on me. They're givin'
me a hard time cos I'm the new guy.

57:28.949 --> 57:30.868
A little first-day hazing.

57:31.034 --> 57:35.664
- Are you in loser denial or something?
- I had a bad case of loser denial myself.

57:35.831 --> 57:38.792
Till the lacrosse team stuck
a parking cone up my ass.

57:39.293 --> 57:43.338
Loser? I ain't no loser.
I was the king of this high school.

57:43.463 --> 57:46.758
A hundred friends, a million parties...

57:46.925 --> 57:49.219
You guys are losers, not me.

57:51.388 --> 57:54.266
And that is what a prime number is.

57:54.433 --> 57:56.602
(children ) Billy!

57:56.768 --> 58:00.063
I figured I got fourth period off,
I'd shoot down and say hi.

58:00.189 --> 58:03.066
- How's high school, Billy?
- Yeah, how's high school?

58:03.192 --> 58:07.196
High school is great.
I mean, I'm learning a lot.

58:07.321 --> 58:11.867
And all the kids are treating me
very nice. It's great.

58:12.034 --> 58:15.037
Gee, I can't wait till I go to high school.

58:16.497 --> 58:18.749
Don't you say that.

58:18.874 --> 58:21.627
Don't you ever say that.

58:21.752 --> 58:23.879
Stay here.

58:24.004 --> 58:26.965
Stay as long as you can.

58:27.090 --> 58:30.469
For the love of God, cherish it.

58:30.594 --> 58:33.096
(Veronica ) Jennifer,
why don't you read out loud?

58:33.222 --> 58:35.974
You gotta cherish it.

58:36.099 --> 58:38.185
You do.

58:38.310 --> 58:39.937
Hm.

58:44.066 --> 58:45.984
I don't understand it.

58:46.109 --> 58:50.364
I mean, ten years ago high school
was the greatest. I had so much fun.

58:50.489 --> 58:53.492
I guess a little too much fun,
since you've gotta do it again.

58:53.617 --> 58:59.331
I know. It's just that classes are so hard,
and all the kids treat me like I'm a goof.

59:00.123 --> 59:02.417
Well, you are a goof.

59:02.543 --> 59:06.004
Suck it up. Eight more weeks
and you're all set.

59:06.129 --> 59:08.799
Yeah, you're right. You're so smart.

59:11.844 --> 59:13.887
- I gotta go, OK?
- OK.

59:14.805 --> 59:16.431
Billy, wait.

59:17.182 --> 59:20.269
It doesn't feel so great
to be called a loser, does it?

59:20.602 --> 59:21.478
No.

59:21.603 --> 59:24.148
Maybe the first time
you went to high school,...

59:24.273 --> 59:28.902
..you weren't as nice to the kids
that you thought were losers.

59:29.027 --> 59:32.322
I know what you're sayin'.
You're so smart.

59:42.332 --> 59:44.376

59:47.254 --> 59:48.255
Hello?

59:48.463 --> 59:51.633
- Hi. Is this Danny McGrath?
- Yeah.

59:51.758 --> 59:55.262
The Danny McGrath that graduated
from Knibb High School in 1984?

59:55.971 --> 1:00:00.267
- Uh, yeah. Who's this?
- This is Billy Madison.

1:00:00.392 --> 1:00:04.605
You probably don't remember me,
but I went to high school with you.

1:00:04.730 --> 1:00:07.232
I kinda gave you a hard time back then,...

1:00:07.357 --> 1:00:11.069
..and I did some things that
I thought were funny at the time,...

1:00:11.195 --> 1:00:14.573
..but now I realise they
were just mean and stupid.

1:00:14.698 --> 1:00:18.327
And I just wanted to apologise,
and I hope you forgive me.

1:00:19.119 --> 1:00:21.288
Yeah, sure. Don't worry about it.

1:00:21.872 --> 1:00:24.583
Wow! That's great!

1:00:24.708 --> 1:00:27.794
Well, I am sorry, and maybe
we can get together some time...

1:00:27.920 --> 1:00:29.963
..and have coffee or somethin'.

1:00:30.547 --> 1:00:33.884
- Sure, I'd like that.
- OK. Well, I'll see you around.

1:00:34.009 --> 1:00:36.053

My name is Max Anderson,...

..and I am the principal
at the Polly Fector Elementary School.

1:01:42.661 --> 1:01:46.623
Recently a young man named
Billy Madison was enrolled there.

1:01:46.748 --> 1:01:50.335
During that time
Mr Madison was disruptive.

1:01:50.460 --> 1:01:55.382
The only reason he passed was that
he offered me a bribe of $5,000,...

1:01:55.507 --> 1:01:58.051
.. which I regrettably accepted.

1:01:59.094 --> 1:02:00.554
I'm sorry, Billy.

1:02:00.679 --> 1:02:05.309

- Why is everybody so glum?
- You seriously don't believe me?

1:02:20.491 --> 1:02:24.328
That's right. I seriously don't believe you.

1:02:24.453 --> 1:02:27.331
The deal's off. Eric's got the company.

1:02:29.500 --> 1:02:32.169
Wow. Good news for me.

1:02:38.425 --> 1:02:41.512
I can't believe this is happening right now.

1:02:44.097 --> 1:02:46.683
Are you gonna come to class on Monday?

1:02:46.809 --> 1:02:49.603
Wouldn't make much sense now, would it?

Hey, baby!

1:03:45.033 --> 1:03:47.202
You lookin' hot tonight!

1:03:47.327 --> 1:03:51.290
- Billy, what has happened to you?
- We're gonna go on a date.

1:03:51.415 --> 1:03:54.710
You, me, Jack and Frank...

1:03:54.835 --> 1:03:59.423

Billy, why are you acting like this?
I know that you didn't pay off Max.

1:04:08.098 --> 1:04:10.809
Well, that makes two of us, then, baby,...

1:04:10.934 --> 1:04:16.565
..but it takes more than two to tango.
Or somethin' like that.

1:04:17.149 --> 1:04:19.651

- No, let's stay.

- Jeez, that was a great game.
- Yeah.

I got an idea for you.
Instead of being an idiot every day,...

1:06:19.480 --> 1:06:22.816
..why don't you go back to school,
graduate and get the company?

1:06:22.941 --> 1:06:25.152
Cos I don't want it any more.

1:06:25.903 --> 1:06:30.199
- What do you mean, you don't want it?
- I got somethin' comin' outta my nose?

who could roll over and die.

1:08:14.720 --> 1:08:17.264
~ Hey, kids, it's me

1:08:17.389 --> 1:08:20.851
~ I bet you thought that I was dead

1:08:20.976 --> 1:08:23.729
~ But when I fell over I just broke my leg

1:08:23.854 --> 1:08:26.523
~ And got a haemorrhage in my head

1:08:28.775 --> 1:08:31.570
~ There are obstacles in the way

1:08:31.695 --> 1:08:34.990
- ~ But together we shall overcome
- ~ Overcome

1:08:35.115 --> 1:08:39.828
~ Cos you can't break our spirit
and you can't kill our dream

1:08:39.953 --> 1:08:44.666
~ Do you have any more gum,
more gum, more gum, more gum?

1:08:44.791 --> 1:08:47.044
~ Do you have any more gum?

1:08:55.719 --> 1:08:58.180
Oh. Hello, kids.

1:08:58.305 --> 1:09:00.516
Mr Anderson, is that you?

1:09:00.766 --> 1:09:01.642
Oh.

1:09:01.767 --> 1:09:04.269
Yes, actually, it is.

1:09:04.394 --> 1:09:07.189
This is just... Well, this is...

1:09:08.398 --> 1:09:12.986
Normally I don't allow children to be
in my home without parental supervision.

1:09:13.111 --> 1:09:16.615
So why don't you just run on... Oh, boy.

1:09:16.740 --> 1:09:21.787
It sure is great to have all you kids come
surprise me like this at my home, but I...

1:09:21.912 --> 1:09:25.582
Mr Anderson, Billy said the stuff
that you said didn't happen.

1:09:25.707 --> 1:09:28.126
Is he lying or are you lying?

1:09:28.252 --> 1:09:33.674
Oh, well, listen, kids.
It's not always as simple as all that.

1:09:36.093 --> 1:09:40.305
The statement I made about Billy Madison
was and is completely untrue.

1:09:40.430 --> 1:09:41.265
No.

1:09:41.390 --> 1:09:43.851
I know now that I shall
never escape my fate...

1:09:43.976 --> 1:09:48.480
- ..as the Revolting Blob.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1:09:49.481 --> 1:09:52.901
(Anderson ) It's something
I must learn to live with.

1:09:53.026 --> 1:09:54.611
Joyce?

1:09:55.404 --> 1:09:58.115
What a mess.

1:09:58.240 --> 1:10:02.619
First this psycho goes on TV,
lies, then retracts it.

1:10:02.744 --> 1:10:05.956
And now Eric's secretary is in a coma.

1:10:06.081 --> 1:10:11.170
Carl, has anybody been able to find out
anything about this Max guy?

1:10:11.295 --> 1:10:15.340
No, sir. He's vanished.
Nobody has any idea where he is.

1:10:15.465 --> 1:10:18.510
- I believed in Billy all along, sir.
- Cut the horseshit!

1:10:18.635 --> 1:10:21.263
- I know you blackmailed Max.
- Take it easy, Billy.

1:10:21.388 --> 1:10:26.768
Things were going along great until
this wrestling freak messed things up.

1:10:28.061 --> 1:10:30.397
Billy should get
another shot at high school.

1:10:30.522 --> 1:10:35.903
Hey, rules are rules. Billy was supposed to
finish each grade within the two weeks...

1:10:36.028 --> 1:10:38.822
..or I get the company.
He didn't finish ninth grade.

1:10:38.947 --> 1:10:41.950
Eric, certainly there are
extenuating circumstances.

1:10:42.075 --> 1:10:46.246
Extenuating, exschmenuating.
We had a deal. A signed, written deal.

1:10:46.371 --> 1:10:48.790
Each grade, two weeks,
or I get the company.

1:10:48.916 --> 1:10:51.710
Well, technically you're right, but...

1:10:51.835 --> 1:10:55.172
Oh, shut up, Brian. I've had
to listen to your jawing for too long.

1:10:55.297 --> 1:10:57.466
''Well, technically...''

1:10:57.591 --> 1:11:02.346
Just shut up! Are you ready
to hand the company over to me now?

1:11:02.471 --> 1:11:05.849
- No.
- Then I'll see your ass in court.

1:11:06.725 --> 1:11:08.477
Good.

1:11:08.602 --> 1:11:11.146
Nice talkin' to ya, shitheads.

1:11:11.772 --> 1:11:14.900
Hey, Eric, how would you like
to settle this now, no lawyers?

1:11:15.025 --> 1:11:17.277
You and me, mano y mano.

1:11:17.402 --> 1:11:20.280
- What does that mean?
- What does that mean?

1:11:20.405 --> 1:11:23.325
- Carl, what does that mean?
- Uh... I don't know.

1:11:28.163 --> 1:11:30.207
It means an academic decathlon.

1:11:30.332 --> 1:11:34.253
One day, ten events, testing all the
knowledge one would gain in high school.

1:11:34.378 --> 1:11:36.839
Me versus you.

1:11:36.964 --> 1:11:41.051
- You're joking, right?
- Let's take it a little easy here, Billy.

1:11:41.176 --> 1:11:45.139
No, I'm serious. Let's do it.
Let's do it on Friday.

1:11:45.264 --> 1:11:48.517
- Let's do it.
- Is that all right with you, Daddy?

1:11:48.642 --> 1:11:50.894
Well, if you think you can beat him.

1:11:51.019 --> 1:11:54.815
Oh, I can. And I will.

1:11:55.524 --> 1:11:58.610
- It's a deal.
- (whispers ) I know it was you.

1:12:01.071 --> 1:12:03.532
You broke my heart.

1:12:06.285 --> 1:12:08.620
Here are the trigonometry hand-outs.

1:12:08.745 --> 1:12:11.331
Last year's physics notes.
Best I could do.

1:12:11.456 --> 1:12:14.793
Thanks a lot, fellas. You're saving my life.

1:12:19.214 --> 1:12:20.757
O'Doyle rules.

1:12:20.883 --> 1:12:24.761
O'Doyle, I got a feeling
your whole family's goin' down.

1:12:25.220 --> 1:12:27.139
But for now I gotta study.

1:12:29.016 --> 1:12:32.728
(Veronica ) Norman invasion of England.

1:12:32.853 --> 1:12:35.063
1066.

1:12:36.648 --> 1:12:38.692
That is correct.

1:12:41.403 --> 1:12:43.572
The Magna Carta.

1:12:46.074 --> 1:12:49.411
1215?

1:12:51.288 --> 1:12:53.332
Yes.

1:12:55.459 --> 1:12:58.462
Spanish Armada.

1:13:01.089 --> 1:13:05.844
1466?

1:13:06.512 --> 1:13:09.223
'67? 1469?

1:13:09.765 --> 1:13:11.558
1514?

1:13:11.683 --> 1:13:14.937
1981? 1986?

1:13:15.437 --> 1:13:20.442
Please do not do that. Come on, I swear...
Just hang in there one second.

1:13:20.567 --> 1:13:23.362
Please, God, give me the answer!

1:13:26.156 --> 1:13:28.492
Buenos dias.

1:13:28.617 --> 1:13:30.953
Buenas tardes.

1:13:31.078 --> 1:13:32.621
Buenas noches.

1:13:32.746 --> 1:13:35.499
(speaks French very quickly )

1:13:39.795 --> 1:13:42.422
Slow down.

1:13:42.548 --> 1:13:45.217
(speaks French very quickly )

1:13:49.304 --> 1:13:50.681
Oh(!)

1:13:55.477 --> 1:13:57.521
Spanish Armada...

1:13:58.397 --> 1:14:00.274
1588.

1:14:00.399 --> 1:14:02.442
That is correct.

1:14:13.745 --> 1:14:17.332
Ladies and gentlemen, thanks to
a generous donation by Mr Madison...

1:14:17.457 --> 1:14:21.962
..to the Knibb High School library, I have
been able to arrange for ten teachers...

1:14:22.087 --> 1:14:26.258
..to administer this academic decathlon
in various courses of study.

1:14:26.383 --> 1:14:30.387
However, if there is any attempt
by either contestant to cheat,...

1:14:30.512 --> 1:14:37.269
..especially with my wife, who is a dirty,
dirty tramp, I am just gonna snap.

1:14:37.394 --> 1:14:40.397
Do I make myself clear?

1:14:40.522 --> 1:14:41.732
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1:14:41.857 --> 1:14:45.569
All right, then.
Let the academic decathlon begin.

1:15:13.639 --> 1:15:15.474
(Billy laughs )

1:15:34.952 --> 1:15:37.913
Second team, all-American, Harvard track.

1:15:38.664 --> 1:15:41.124
Is that right?

1:15:43.001 --> 1:15:46.839
Oh, gross! Did you see that guy's balls?

1:15:46.964 --> 1:15:49.424
Yeah, they were weird-lookin'.

1:15:54.847 --> 1:15:56.557
Whoa!

1:16:10.737 --> 1:16:12.781
(tuneful melody )

1:16:29.840 --> 1:16:31.884
(squeaking )

1:16:34.428 --> 1:16:35.888
He's good.

1:16:36.346 --> 1:16:39.433
To be, or not to be:

1:16:40.934 --> 1:16:42.811
that is the question:

1:16:42.936 --> 1:16:46.356
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer

1:16:46.482 --> 1:16:50.611
The slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune...

1:16:50.736 --> 1:16:56.325
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,

1:16:56.450 --> 1:17:00.370
And by opposing end them?

1:17:01.288 --> 1:17:05.209
To die: to sleep;

1:17:05.334 --> 1:17:07.377
No more.

1:17:08.170 --> 1:17:09.880
(boy ) Billy!

1:17:11.507 --> 1:17:13.342
Hey, hey, hey. Who rules?

1:17:13.467 --> 1:17:15.260
O'Doyle rules!

1:17:15.886 --> 1:17:16.887
O'Doyle rules!

1:17:17.513 --> 1:17:18.514
O'Doyle rules!

1:17:19.223 --> 1:17:20.224
O'Doyle rules!

1:17:20.641 --> 1:17:22.059
O'Doyle rules!

1:17:22.267 --> 1:17:23.268
O'Doyle rules!

1:17:24.019 --> 1:17:25.020
O'Doyle rules!

1:17:25.687 --> 1:17:27.314
O'Doyle rules!

1:17:27.439 --> 1:17:29.483
(explosion )

1:17:42.246 --> 1:17:43.997
Good afternoon, students.

1:17:44.122 --> 1:17:47.793
You've been invited here today
to witness the tenth and final event...

1:17:47.918 --> 1:17:53.340
..in the competition between
Mr Eric Gordon and Mr Billy Madison.

1:17:59.513 --> 1:18:03.851
As of this moment, Mr Madison
is ahead by one point.

1:18:05.644 --> 1:18:09.648
Each competitor will select
the final category for his opponent.

1:18:09.773 --> 1:18:14.278
Mr Madison will go first.
Mr Gordon, choose the topic.

1:18:15.404 --> 1:18:17.698
English Literature.

1:18:17.823 --> 1:18:20.159
US Presidents.

1:18:20.284 --> 1:18:22.744
My Wife, the Tramp.

1:18:23.495 --> 1:18:26.582
Burning Dog Poo
and the Human Response.

1:18:26.707 --> 1:18:29.334
Reflections of Society in Literature.

1:18:29.918 --> 1:18:32.796
Reflections of Society in Literature.

1:18:33.672 --> 1:18:35.757
Good luck, schmuck.

1:18:37.551 --> 1:18:39.178
Mr Madison.

1:18:39.303 --> 1:18:43.432
The Industrial Revolution changed
the face of the modern novel for ever.

1:18:43.557 --> 1:18:47.060
Discuss, citing specific examples.

1:18:49.730 --> 1:18:51.815
(yelling )

1:18:51.940 --> 1:18:53.984
(clears throat )

1:18:56.069 --> 1:18:57.863
Uh...

1:18:57.988 --> 1:18:58.989
Come on!

1:19:05.037 --> 1:19:06.914
OK.

1:19:07.039 --> 1:19:10.417
The Industrial Revolution, to me,
is just like a story I know...

1:19:10.542 --> 1:19:13.837
..called The Puppy Who Lost His Way.

1:19:15.756 --> 1:19:18.509
The world was changing...

1:19:18.634 --> 1:19:22.971
..and the puppy was getting... bigger.

1:19:23.597 --> 1:19:28.477
So, you see, the puppy was like industry,...

1:19:28.602 --> 1:19:32.940
..in that they were both
lost in the woods,...

1:19:33.065 --> 1:19:40.531
..and nobody, especially the little boy -
society - knew where to find them.

1:19:43.325 --> 1:19:47.454
Except that the puppy... was a dog.

1:19:48.664 --> 1:19:51.834
But the industry, my friends,...

1:19:51.959 --> 1:19:54.419
..that was a revolution.

1:19:57.840 --> 1:20:00.300
Knibb High football rules!

1:20:13.480 --> 1:20:17.067
Mr Madison, what you've just said...

1:20:17.192 --> 1:20:21.280
..is one of the most insanely
idiotic things I have ever heard.

1:20:21.405 --> 1:20:25.909
At no point in your rambling,
incoherent response...

1:20:26.034 --> 1:20:31.081
..were you even close to anything that
could be considered a rational thought.

1:20:31.206 --> 1:20:36.211
Everyone in this room is now dumber
for having listened to it.

1:20:36.336 --> 1:20:41.300
I award you no points,
and may God have mercy on your soul.

1:20:42.426 --> 1:20:45.554
OK. A simple ''wrong''
would have done just fine, but...

1:20:45.679 --> 1:20:48.015
You remain one point ahead.

1:20:48.140 --> 1:20:52.394
Mr Gordon, it is your turn.
Mr Madison, choose the topic.

1:20:58.775 --> 1:21:02.070
I choose Business Ethics.

1:21:05.491 --> 1:21:10.329
Mr Gordon. The American business
environment has fundamentally changed...

1:21:10.454 --> 1:21:14.291
..following the insider trading
and savings and loan scandals.

1:21:14.416 --> 1:21:18.545
Explain business ethics,
and how they are applied today.

1:21:28.680 --> 1:21:32.309
The, uh, ethics of, uh, business...

1:21:32.434 --> 1:21:34.895
..can be summarised in...

1:21:38.440 --> 1:21:40.400
Yeah, um...

1:21:40.526 --> 1:21:42.152
See...

1:21:42.277 --> 1:21:44.112
Ethics are, uh...

1:21:45.197 --> 1:21:48.367
You know, the... the thing about ethics...

1:21:48.492 --> 1:21:50.536
Aagh!

1:21:53.413 --> 1:21:56.792
That question was not fair!
That was not in the reading.

1:21:56.917 --> 1:22:00.420
- I demand a new question.
- Take it easy, psycho.

1:22:01.046 --> 1:22:03.340
You blew it. You lose.

1:22:03.465 --> 1:22:05.843
I oughta blow you away, you miserable...

1:22:05.968 --> 1:22:08.554
Well, go ahead and do it.

1:22:08.679 --> 1:22:10.222
Yikes!

1:22:14.184 --> 1:22:15.352
No!

1:22:16.603 --> 1:22:18.647
(Eric ) Get off me!

1:22:24.528 --> 1:22:25.654
No!

1:22:32.494 --> 1:22:35.914
Man, I'm glad I called that guy.

1:22:41.044 --> 1:22:44.298
- Max, are you OK?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm OK.

1:22:44.423 --> 1:22:45.424
OK.

1:22:45.549 --> 1:22:49.261
A little confused, kinda sweaty,...

1:22:49.386 --> 1:22:51.263
..a little hungry,...

1:22:51.388 --> 1:22:54.141
..but all in all I'm OK.

1:23:05.027 --> 1:23:08.864
Thank you, thank you,
thank you very much. Thank you.

1:23:08.989 --> 1:23:14.369
Well, what can I say? I graduated.
It's over. I did it.

1:23:14.495 --> 1:23:19.124
I know most of you are sayin'
''Hey, any idiot could do that.''

1:23:19.249 --> 1:23:23.170
Well, it was tough for me, so back off!

1:23:24.213 --> 1:23:29.885
- Sorry. Sorry about that.
- Yahoo, Billy! Billy's number one! Yahoo!

1:23:31.720 --> 1:23:33.555
(Billy ) That's nice, buddy.

1:23:33.680 --> 1:23:35.265
Yahoo!

1:23:35.390 --> 1:23:37.476
Yahoo for school!

1:23:37.601 --> 1:23:39.645
Yahoo for me!

1:23:41.772 --> 1:23:45.734
Anyways, this hotel stuff
really isn't for me,...

1:23:45.859 --> 1:23:50.948
..so I decided to step down
as chairman of Madison Hotels...

1:23:51.073 --> 1:23:53.742
..and give the company to Carl.

1:23:58.622 --> 1:24:02.125
I'm gonna go to college.
I'm gonna be a teacher.

1:24:04.419 --> 1:24:08.215
- Peace! I'm outta here!
- (cheering )

1:24:08.340 --> 1:24:09.842
Daddy.

1:24:09.967 --> 1:24:13.178
What can I say? I saved the day, I guess.

1:24:13.303 --> 1:24:16.181
I mean, Eric doesn't
take over the company.

1:24:16.306 --> 1:24:18.684
Are you sure this is what you wanna do?

1:24:18.809 --> 1:24:21.687
I'm sure, Dad. Thanks for everything.

1:24:24.773 --> 1:24:27.818
Max! What can I say, buddy?
You saved my life.

1:24:27.943 --> 1:24:31.446
You don't have to say anything.
I'm so proud of you.

1:24:32.114 --> 1:24:34.449
But I'm still horny.

1:24:35.492 --> 1:24:38.162
All right, man. You're hurting me.

1:24:42.499 --> 1:24:44.793
You think he's horny.

1:24:44.918 --> 1:24:46.962
Come here.
