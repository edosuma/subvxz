Now, Franklin's treatise
was not, in fact,

12:50.252 --> 12:52.453
the definitive history of
the Eye of Providence.

12:52.454 --> 12:56.057
That was written by...

12:56.058 --> 12:58.192
his fellow Mason Paul Revere.

12:58.193 --> 13:00.494
Okay, I'm still not used

13:00.495 --> 13:02.163
What does it say?

13:02.164 --> 13:05.199
The article was penned in 1776,

13:05.200 --> 13:08.102
shortly after Washington
crossed the Delaware River.

13:08.103 --> 13:10.871
Faced with his enemy General Howe's

13:10.872 --> 13:13.574
continued use of arcane power,

13:13.575 --> 13:15.042
Washington sought out

13:15.043 --> 13:17.078
a supernatural weapon of his own...

13:17.079 --> 13:20.181
the self-same Eye of Providence.

13:21.883 --> 13:23.918
<i>General Washington called for Paul Revere</i>

13:23.919 --> 13:26.287
<i>in his capacity as arcane weaponsmith.</i>

13:26.288 --> 13:27.988
<i>Revere brought with him</i>

13:27.989 --> 13:30.658
<i>his nephew and apprentice,
Jonathan Revere.</i>

13:30.659 --> 13:34.328

a weapon he had procured,</i>

13:34.329 --> 13:38.232
<i>a power that could potentially
turn the tide of the war.</i>

13:40.469 --> 13:42.303
<i>An ancient gemstone</i>

13:42.304 --> 13:46.073
<i>said to possess the power of the gods.</i>

13:58.019 --> 14:00.221
<i>The power of the Eye was absorbed</i>

14:00.222 --> 14:02.156
<i>by young Jonathan,</i>

14:02.157 --> 14:04.692
just as it was by our Miss Jenny.

14:05.494 --> 14:07.027
What happened to him?

14:08.997 --> 14:12.133
CRANE: <i>Revere begged his protégé</i>

14:12.134 --> 14:15.169

cure for his condition.</i>

14:17.005 --> 14:19.940
<i>Johnny knew he did not have long.</i>

14:19.941 --> 14:22.109
<i>He made a heroic sacrifice</i>

14:22.110 --> 14:25.412
<i>that Revere was powerless to avert.</i>

14:28.116 --> 14:30.317
We need to stop him

14:31.820 --> 14:33.320
drains the Eye's energy out of Jenny.

14:33.321 --> 14:35.089
Or it goes critical and
takes out the town.

14:35.090 --> 14:37.825
Well, that is not a viable option.

14:37.826 --> 14:40.027
So all we have is a working
knowledge of Sumerian

14:40.028 --> 14:41.428

He was in the employ of Pandora.

He's not talking. If we
want to find her secrets,

14:47.435 --> 14:48.702
we'll have to do it on our own.

(screaming)

16:01.236 --> 16:02.983
Revere holds the key.

16:05.342 --> 16:07.877
His account of the Eye features a series

16:07.878 --> 16:11.314
of seemingly arbitrary
numbers in the marginalia.

16:11.315 --> 16:13.383
A Dumas code.

16:13.384 --> 16:16.052
Revere left a final encrypted entry

16:16.053 --> 16:18.054
the day following the
death of young Jonathan.

16:18.055 --> 16:20.656
<i>The energy of the Eye dispersed,</i>

16:20.657 --> 16:22.825
<i>leaving destruction in its wake.</i>

16:22.826 --> 16:25.595
<i>Yet the artifact itself,</i>

16:25.596 --> 16:28.231

16:28.232 --> 16:29.499
<i>remained intact.</i>

<i>from whence the Eye had
come to draw it out.</i>

the Eye too dangerous.

16:44.548 --> 16:46.315
'Twas to be hidden, to prevent it

16:46.316 --> 16:48.151
- from falling into the wrong hands...
- Hold on, hold on.

16:48.152 --> 16:50.853
That staff, it was like an Eye magnet?

16:50.854 --> 16:52.355
If we could find it, we could use it.

16:52.356 --> 16:53.589
The staff. Of course.

16:53.590 --> 16:55.024
I really hope you're about to say,

16:55.025 --> 16:56.859
"I think I've seen this staff before."

16:56.860 --> 16:58.127
Briefly.

The final hours of 1776,

17:21.285 --> 17:23.286
- at Princeton. - Tell Mercer his
sword will be ready tomorrow,

once I deal with more pressing matters.

17:29.626 --> 17:31.794
An order for General Washington.

17:31.795 --> 17:33.029
Very good.

17:33.030 --> 17:34.997
Thank you, Major.

17:38.669 --> 17:41.971
I heard Master Jonathan
was lost to the pox.

17:41.972 --> 17:44.207
Yes.

That brutal plague.

17:48.745 --> 17:50.646

17:52.916 --> 17:55.184

17:55.185 --> 17:58.488
Don't let anyone in too close.

17:58.489 --> 18:00.723
When you lose them,

18:00.724 --> 18:02.225

18:29.386 --> 18:32.021
CRANE: <i>Revere was
smelting down the staff</i>

18:32.022 --> 18:33.322
<i>on Washington's orders,</i>

18:33.323 --> 18:35.825
reshaping its inscrutable metal

18:35.826 --> 18:37.727
into an iron mold.

18:37.728 --> 18:40.730
Revere's mold was two
halves of a sphere, right?

18:40.731 --> 18:42.398
Do you think

18:42.399 --> 18:44.066
you could sketch what he was forging?

18:44.067 --> 18:45.434
Can I sketch...

18:45.435 --> 18:47.336
I was painting oils

18:47.337 --> 18:49.338
while Gilbert Stuart was still
shredding snuff in Narragansett.

18:49.339 --> 18:51.073
So that's a yes?

18:51.074 --> 18:52.375
Yes.

19:01.485 --> 19:03.085
Jenny and I had that.

19:05.055 --> 19:06.856
That's the same casing
that held the Eye.

19:07.958 --> 19:10.393
So Revere melted down the staff

19:10.394 --> 19:13.262
to make the casing to contain
the Eye's catastrophic energies.

19:13.263 --> 19:14.597
More than contain.

19:14.598 --> 19:16.599
Pandora always seems to know about

19:16.600 --> 19:18.100
all sorts of things that she shouldn't,

19:18.101 --> 19:20.970
but she couldn't find the Eye.

19:20.971 --> 19:24.106
What if the casing can contain
the power and hide it?

19:24.107 --> 19:25.341
That would explain why she needed

19:25.342 --> 19:26.609
Nevins to procure it for her.

19:26.610 --> 19:28.144
So if we can find the casing,

19:28.145 --> 19:29.979
we can draw the Eye out of Jenny.

19:29.980 --> 19:32.114
Save her life without having
to destroy half the county.

19:32.115 --> 19:34.217
Nevins still had that casing
when the feds took him in.

19:34.218 --> 19:37.653
It should still be in lockup
with the rest of the evidence.

19:37.654 --> 19:40.856

- Stay put. I'll be back.

25:23.180 --> 25:25.014
<i>High alert status.
Agents report to your posts.</i>

25:25.015 --> 25:26.282
<i>All agents.</i>

25:26.283 --> 25:27.417
Hey.

25:27.418 --> 25:28.918
That's far enough.

25:28.919 --> 25:31.721
Uh, is this about Nevins?

25:31.722 --> 25:32.693
That wicked man

25:32.694 --> 25:34.360
gave me what he owed me.

25:34.361 --> 25:36.428
My sister, where is she?

25:36.429 --> 25:39.365
You know, you don't have
to fight us, Abbie.

25:39.366 --> 25:42.701
There is a place for you two
Witnesses in the new world.

25:42.702 --> 25:44.637
You have a right by lineage.

25:44.638 --> 25:46.171
I swear,

25:46.172 --> 25:49.174
if you do anything to harm her...

25:49.175 --> 25:51.510
That is beautiful.
That's loyalty to family.

25:53.813 --> 25:56.348
But I'm sensing
something else underneath.

25:57.517 --> 25:58.784
There's an old wound.

26:01.655 --> 26:04.156
It's festering.

26:06.960 --> 26:08.994
You've failed her before, haven't you?

26:10.130 --> 26:12.064
(growling)

26:12.899 --> 26:14.633
Tell them what you saw, Abbie!

26:14.634 --> 26:16.602
Tell them!

26:18.238 --> 26:20.272
And it's so tragic.

26:20.273 --> 26:21.373
Mills!

26:21.374 --> 26:22.641
What the hell are you doing?

26:25.779 --> 26:27.713
Thought I saw something.

26:29.826 --> 26:31.389
Reynolds wants you in his office.

26:41.094 --> 26:42.895
Hmm.

26:48.468 --> 26:51.487
CRANE: For a structure
that was once an armory,

26:51.488 --> 26:54.323
and despite my best efforts,

26:54.324 --> 26:56.826
we are still in limited
supply of armaments.

26:56.827 --> 26:59.562
I'm not sure what good any
weapon's gonna do against a god.

26:59.563 --> 27:02.298
CRANE: <i>The Grimoire</i>

27:02.299 --> 27:04.533
<i>of Lycanthropic Curses.</i>

27:13.777 --> 27:15.778
Master Corbin,

27:15.779 --> 27:18.614
you were afflicted with
one of the most insidious

27:18.615 --> 27:20.549
of the lycan curses,

27:20.550 --> 27:23.652
the blood thirst of the Wendigo.

27:23.653 --> 27:26.989
(crackling)

27:26.990 --> 27:27.990
(growls)

27:27.991 --> 27:29.925
Not a subject to revisit.

27:30.994 --> 27:33.929
I'd do anything to save Jenny.

27:35.165 --> 27:37.433
You went to weapon up.
I thought that...

27:37.434 --> 27:38.667
(sighs) if there was some way

27:38.668 --> 27:40.269
that I could access that power again,

27:40.270 --> 27:41.837
that ferocity, but control it...

27:41.838 --> 27:43.038
There are lines

27:43.039 --> 27:45.407
we do not cross.

27:45.408 --> 27:48.744
Forces we do not unleash.

27:48.745 --> 27:51.580
Or else we risk the very humanity

27:51.581 --> 27:53.082
for which we fight.

27:53.083 --> 27:54.984
Yeah, I get the logic.

27:54.985 --> 27:58.254
Just doesn't make me feel any better.

27:58.255 --> 28:01.457
I know.

28:01.458 --> 28:04.660
Often, when love grips the heart,

28:04.661 --> 28:08.464
logic can abandon the mind.

28:14.171 --> 28:16.071
We will save Miss Jenny,

28:16.072 --> 28:18.007
and when we do,

28:18.008 --> 28:20.176
she will need you in the form of a man,

28:20.177 --> 28:21.911
not a beast.

28:21.912 --> 28:24.280
(scoffs)

28:30.253 --> 28:31.353
The more bodies that we throw

28:31.354 --> 28:32.688
at this Nevins thing, the more chance

28:32.689 --> 28:34.924
we have of catching him
before he slips the nets.

28:34.925 --> 28:37.665
- I should be out there look...
- You should park it in that chair.

28:42.632 --> 28:43.832
My case aside,

28:43.833 --> 28:44.923
our relationship aside,

28:44.924 --> 28:46.391
Nevins is a dangerous man.

28:46.392 --> 28:47.467
Withholding information...

28:47.468 --> 28:49.519
If you're implying I know
where he is, I don't.

28:49.520 --> 28:50.427
Your sister was involved.

28:50.428 --> 28:52.471
Jenny has an interest in antiquities.

28:52.909 --> 28:54.610
She was tracking something down.

28:54.611 --> 28:56.111
Did money change hands?

28:56.112 --> 28:57.282
Did she get what she was looking for?

28:57.283 --> 28:58.804
Well, that has no bearings in your case.

28:58.805 --> 29:00.243
I'll decide that.

29:00.951 --> 29:02.785
(sighs)

29:02.786 --> 29:03.911
While I was down in D.C.,

29:03.912 --> 29:06.555
you pulled surveillance off of
Nevins' base of operations.

29:06.556 --> 29:08.971
Agent Foster caught your
friend Crane snooping around,

29:08.972 --> 29:12.228
and then, just an hour ago, the
one person Nevins asked for,

29:12.229 --> 29:15.231
the one person he thinks
can cover his ass...

29:15.232 --> 29:16.999
Mills, you do not walk out on me.

29:17.000 --> 29:18.600
I'm your superior officer.

29:20.270 --> 29:22.738
Are you gonna tell me
that this isn't personal?

29:22.739 --> 29:24.289
We both made promises, Danny.

29:24.290 --> 29:25.926
And guess what? We both broke them.

29:25.927 --> 29:27.182
You haven't been straight with me

29:27.183 --> 29:28.805
from the second I pulled into this town.

29:28.806 --> 29:30.687
At least I tried to be honest with you.

29:30.688 --> 29:31.854
I want to tell you everything,

29:31.855 --> 29:33.089
but I can't.

29:33.883 --> 29:36.452
All I ask

29:36.453 --> 29:39.254
is that you try to understand.

29:40.790 --> 29:42.291
Yeah, I can't do that,

29:42.292 --> 29:43.892
and if you can't give me the answers

29:43.893 --> 29:45.094
I need...

29:57.607 --> 29:59.708
Mills...

30:11.588 --> 30:13.256
(line ringing)

30:13.257 --> 30:15.737
WALTERS: You were told not to
call this number, Agent Reynolds.

30:15.928 --> 30:18.127
Unless I had a problem, and this rates.

30:18.778 --> 30:21.263
The asset we were cultivating,

30:21.264 --> 30:23.433
we just lost her.

30:27.743 --> 30:29.833
This is Abby Mills, you know what to do.

30:29.834 --> 30:32.241
And if this is you, Crane, I
mean it, wait for the beep.

30:32.242 --> 30:33.275
(beep)

30:33.276 --> 30:34.743
REYNOLDS: It's me. Look...

30:34.744 --> 30:36.111
I know you think we each

30:36.112 --> 30:37.613
have a different dog in this fight,

30:37.614 --> 30:40.616
but we're on the same side.

30:40.617 --> 30:43.619
I haven't filed your resignation yet.

30:43.620 --> 30:45.153
Come in, figure this thing out,

30:45.154 --> 30:47.723
I don't have to.

30:50.627 --> 30:52.861
State and local are on this now.

30:52.862 --> 30:54.863
Setting up road blocks
in a 20-mile radius.

30:54.864 --> 30:56.765
Also, we have people at the
train and bus stations,

30:56.766 --> 30:58.255
Westchester County Airport.

30:58.256 --> 30:59.234
The river?

30:59.235 --> 31:01.303
Yeah, Ossining has double
patrols on the Hudson.

31:01.304 --> 31:03.372
It's getting dark now.

31:03.373 --> 31:04.940
He's likely injured,

31:04.941 --> 31:07.009
but he could still cover
some ground overnight.

31:08.578 --> 31:10.245
Something else?

31:10.246 --> 31:12.414
I know you and Agent Mills were close,

31:12.415 --> 31:13.849
but if I had known that you...

31:13.850 --> 31:16.184
Was there anything else, Agent Foster?

31:16.185 --> 31:18.186
Yeah, there sure as hell is.

31:18.187 --> 31:21.456
Before she turned in her security pass,

31:21.457 --> 31:23.392
Mills requested all this from Tactical.

31:26.829 --> 31:29.398
Assault breaching equipment,
night vision goggles,

31:29.399 --> 31:31.867
high explosive ordnance?

31:31.868 --> 31:34.836
That's heavy gear for someone
who just turned in their badge.

31:34.837 --> 31:37.139
Is she even trained
to use all that stuff?

31:37.140 --> 31:39.374
I knew her at Quantico.

31:39.375 --> 31:42.310
If the situation calls,
she's trained to wage war.

31:43.413 --> 31:46.014
You don't owe me this, Foster,

31:46.015 --> 31:48.617
but I need you to find her.

31:54.257 --> 31:56.158
(gun clicking)

31:57.493 --> 31:59.861
This is a rescue mission,
pure and simple.

31:59.862 --> 32:01.347
We go in hard and fast,

32:01.348 --> 32:02.698
grab Jenny, get the Eye out of her,

32:02.699 --> 32:04.166
and get the hell out of there.

32:04.167 --> 32:05.901
You are not pulling any punches.

32:05.902 --> 32:08.604
I haven't seen hardware like
this since my last tour.

32:08.605 --> 32:10.372
If Pandora and her
boyfriend get in our face,

32:10.373 --> 32:11.607
we put them down.

32:11.608 --> 32:13.575
- Roger that.
- Heartily seconded.

32:13.576 --> 32:15.236
Let's put this stuff in the car and go.

32:17.080 --> 32:19.114
I found this in lockup.
Belonged to Nevins.

32:19.115 --> 32:21.116
Looked old, magical,
you know, Crane-ish.

32:21.117 --> 32:22.618
Thought it might come in handy.

32:22.619 --> 32:24.720
<i>The Ynglinga Saga?</i>

32:25.888 --> 32:27.623
Oh, my.

32:27.624 --> 32:29.958
Wait, look.

32:29.959 --> 32:31.493
These are summoning spells.

32:31.494 --> 32:34.463
Some in Latin, some in Norse.

32:34.464 --> 32:35.664
Wait, Norse like those berserkers

32:35.665 --> 32:36.999
that came after Jenny?

32:37.000 --> 32:39.301
Nevins must have used
this to summon them.

32:39.302 --> 32:41.837
Now I'm curious.

32:41.838 --> 32:44.339
What other creatures could this raise?

32:44.340 --> 32:47.175
I like where you're headed with this.

32:47.176 --> 32:49.511
Wait, so that book can pull
monsters out of Pandora's box?

32:49.512 --> 32:51.780
If it can,

32:51.781 --> 32:54.049
it may be very handy indeed.

32:56.886 --> 32:58.720
Let's go get my sister.

33:02.058 --> 33:04.126
The time has come

33:04.127 --> 33:06.228
to return what is mine.

33:06.229 --> 33:08.063
(weakly): I hope...

33:08.064 --> 33:11.166
you choke on it.

33:11.167 --> 33:12.968
PANDORA: Wait.

33:12.969 --> 33:15.403
Just a moment, dearest.

33:23.112 --> 33:26.782
I want to watch.

33:26.783 --> 33:28.049
Of course.

33:30.153 --> 33:32.154
From this moment on,

33:32.155 --> 33:36.658
as we planned all those
thousands of years ago,

33:36.659 --> 33:40.295
we shall be together in all things.

33:54.477 --> 33:55.744
I'm in position.

33:55.745 --> 33:57.879
ABBIE (over radio): Copy that, Joe.

33:57.880 --> 34:00.582
How do you like our odds, Crane?

34:00.583 --> 34:02.584
Be honest.

34:02.585 --> 34:05.987
Three mortals facing a woman of legend

34:05.988 --> 34:08.356
and an ancient deity.

34:08.357 --> 34:11.293
Obviously, we don't stand a chance.

34:11.293 --> 34:14.563
I did say "Be honest."

34:14.563 --> 34:16.188
I'd like to think you
and I have developed,

34:16.190 --> 34:18.533
over the years, Lieutenant.

34:18.534 --> 34:20.235
We have fought off horsemen,

34:20.235 --> 34:22.237
demons,

34:22.237 --> 34:23.538
witches.

34:23.539 --> 34:24.906
Norse berserkers,

34:24.907 --> 34:27.708
whispering wraiths.

34:27.710 --> 34:29.043
Zombie redcoats.

34:29.045 --> 34:30.145
Evil scarecrows,

34:30.146 --> 34:31.780
golem.

34:31.781 --> 34:33.815
And we sent them packing.

34:33.815 --> 34:35.250
- Mm.
- Handily.

34:35.251 --> 34:37.918
Yeah, we did.

34:40.322 --> 34:42.891
This is our first god, though.

34:51.199 --> 34:54.335
This plan of ours is crazy, huh?

34:54.337 --> 34:56.271
Is that a question?

34:56.272 --> 34:58.473
I mean it, Crane.

34:58.474 --> 35:01.877
What if my judgment is impaired
because it's Jenny out there?

35:03.946 --> 35:07.549
"To wage war fearing loss
is to give in to defeat."

35:09.118 --> 35:11.019
And yet the only thing
running through my mind

35:11.020 --> 35:13.822
is, I am going to lose my sister.

35:13.823 --> 35:15.056
With all respect

35:15.057 --> 35:18.493
to my fellow compatriot, Major Revere,

35:18.494 --> 35:20.362
your spirit and mine

35:20.363 --> 35:23.798
is made of far heartier stock.

35:25.368 --> 35:27.736
Hence our most impressive
roster of victories.

35:27.737 --> 35:30.972
'Tis because we care.

35:35.578 --> 35:37.746
Come what may.

35:37.747 --> 35:40.348
Come what may.

35:43.586 --> 35:46.087
We're moving in, Joe. Stand by.

35:46.088 --> 35:48.690
Standing by.

35:49.926 --> 35:52.928
You ready to fight some bad guys, Crane?

35:52.929 --> 35:54.763
Indeed.

35:54.764 --> 35:56.951
My man.

36:09.350 --> 36:10.982
ABBIE: All clear.

36:11.203 --> 36:12.337
Pop the door.

36:12.338 --> 36:14.339
(latch thuds, door creaks)

36:16.576 --> 36:17.843
ABBIE: We're in.

36:17.844 --> 36:19.577
Let's move.

36:25.518 --> 36:30.589
(Jenny groaning, moaning)

36:30.590 --> 36:32.624
(Jenny cries out, sobs)

36:34.360 --> 36:36.394
She's alive.

36:36.395 --> 36:38.530
Joe, I got eyes on Jenny.

36:38.531 --> 36:41.800
(over radio): She's still with us.

36:41.801 --> 36:43.335
JOE (over radio):
We need to move quickly,

36:43.336 --> 36:46.071
before that thing inside her blows.

36:46.072 --> 36:47.639
Ready to shock and awe.

36:47.640 --> 36:50.542
Good to go.

36:50.543 --> 36:52.677
Cover me.

37:00.887 --> 37:02.888
Intruders, my love.

37:02.889 --> 37:06.057
No, no, no.

37:06.058 --> 37:08.159
Let me.

37:09.829 --> 37:13.498
Enjoy your feast.

37:18.905 --> 37:20.005
(Jenny gasps)

37:27.580 --> 37:30.786
Nothing more irritating
than unannounced guests.

37:30.787 --> 37:32.284
Yeah, I thought about your offer,

37:32.285 --> 37:33.585
and I came to tell you

37:33.586 --> 37:35.186
you can go to hell.

37:38.457 --> 37:39.891
Time and again,

37:39.892 --> 37:41.893
you resist the fact that fate

37:41.894 --> 37:43.388
cannot be changed.

37:43.389 --> 37:45.390
Yours is sealed,

37:45.391 --> 37:47.659
as is your sister's.

37:47.660 --> 37:49.227
We're stubborn that way.

37:49.228 --> 37:51.329
Fire in the hole.

37:58.771 --> 38:00.705
(Pandora groans)

38:15.921 --> 38:18.756
Abbie, you have to get out of here.

38:18.757 --> 38:19.958
It's too late.

38:19.959 --> 38:21.926
Hold on.

38:21.927 --> 38:23.461
I'm going to get that thing out of you.

38:23.462 --> 38:24.996
No.

38:24.997 --> 38:26.764
(heart beating) You have to go.

38:26.765 --> 38:29.267
There's no time.

38:29.268 --> 38:31.769
I'm not leaving you.

38:36.308 --> 38:38.142
Never again.

38:44.350 --> 38:48.820
<i>Vocat agmina nostra tellure antiquis</i>

38:48.821 --> 38:53.424
<i>temporibus processit...
continentiam vacuum</i>

38:53.425 --> 38:54.792
<i>irrumperent...</i>

38:54.793 --> 38:56.794
- emergere.
- How dare you!

38:56.795 --> 38:57.996
<i>Entia vacuum.</i>

38:57.997 --> 38:58.997
<i>Emergere.</i>

38:58.998 --> 39:01.933
Emergere.

39:08.207 --> 39:09.741
HIDDEN ONE: Humans...

39:09.742 --> 39:12.043
often refuse to accept

39:12.044 --> 39:13.811
when they have been defeated.

39:15.181 --> 39:17.515
Let me help you with that.

39:19.518 --> 39:21.519
Abbie!

39:23.522 --> 39:24.889
No.

39:34.967 --> 39:36.968
Oh, no.

39:39.471 --> 39:41.673
You have no idea what you are doing.

39:41.674 --> 39:44.142
Oh, I rather think I do.

39:44.143 --> 39:47.178
Let us see what creatures
from within heed my call.

39:47.179 --> 39:49.681
(both speaking Latin)

39:51.083 --> 39:52.984
Emergere!

39:52.985 --> 39:55.486
Entia vacuum...

39:55.487 --> 39:58.056
<i>Emergere! Continentiam</i>

39:58.057 --> 39:59.557
- (speaking Latin)
- <i>vacuum...</i>

39:59.558 --> 40:01.759
<i>irrumperent!</i>

40:04.663 --> 40:06.230
(Jenny sobbing)

40:24.783 --> 40:26.951
Hold on, Jenny.

40:26.952 --> 40:30.988
Come on... come on.

40:39.832 --> 40:41.466
(gasps)

40:41.467 --> 40:42.700
(sighs)

40:48.774 --> 40:50.875
(gasping)

41:04.123 --> 41:06.224
(rumbling)

41:13.265 --> 41:16.067
JENNY: Abbie, what have you done?

41:28.881 --> 41:31.115
Abbie...

41:31.116 --> 41:34.052
I have to do this.

41:34.053 --> 41:36.721
It's the only way that I can save you.

41:37.556 --> 41:38.823
Abbie! Don't!

41:39.992 --> 41:41.192
Lieutenant!

41:46.899 --> 41:49.767
Don't.

41:50.769 --> 41:53.438
Take care of each other.

42:04.917 --> 42:07.251
(rumbling)

42:14.393 --> 42:16.761
(groans)

42:16.762 --> 42:19.630
(panting)

42:28.040 --> 42:30.141
Joe.

42:31.243 --> 42:33.344
(groans)

42:45.825 --> 42:47.926
Oh, thank God.

42:50.463 --> 42:52.430
Oh, no.

42:52.431 --> 42:55.300
(gasping)

43:04.343 --> 43:06.444
Abbie?
