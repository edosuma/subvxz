Bonnie: Oh, my God.

00:02.144 --> 00:03.844
It's beautiful!

00:03.880 --> 00:05.579
Isn't it beautiful?

00:05.615 --> 00:06.814
It's so beautiful.

00:06.849 --> 00:09.783
And so... white.

00:09.818 --> 00:12.686
How many times have you
walked down the aisle?

00:14.223 --> 00:15.222
Exactly.

00:15.291 --> 00:17.291
All right,
now I need you guys to keep my dress here.

00:17.360 --> 00:19.109
It's bad luck for the groom
to see it before the wedding.

00:19.161 --> 00:21.228
What are you gonna do about
all the other stuff he's seen?

00:21.264 --> 00:23.931
Why do you think he asked me to marry him?

00:23.966 --> 00:27.034
Okay, Ben, guard this with your life.

00:27.069 --> 00:28.085
You got it, all right.

00:28.120 --> 00:29.937
You have absolutely nothing to worry about.

00:31.023 --> 00:33.791
- Oh, my God! Whoa, whoa!
- Aah!

00:34.944 --> 00:36.443
Well, that was close.

00:36.479 --> 00:37.645
What is the matter with you, Ben?

00:37.680 --> 00:39.380
I'm gonna put this in my room.

00:39.415 --> 00:40.447
Here.

00:57.950 --> 01:01.535
if anyone ever speaks of this, they'll
be going to a wedding, and a funeral.

01:02.671 --> 01:03.653
I'm doing this for mom.

01:03.706 --> 01:05.572
I'm doing this for the Internet.

01:05.574 --> 01:08.458
- Hey!
- Danny, stay!

01:08.494 --> 01:11.628
God, I just can't believe
your mom's getting married.

01:11.663 --> 01:13.463
Again.

01:13.499 --> 01:14.664
Before me.

01:14.717 --> 01:15.749
And me.

01:16.835 --> 01:18.952
What? I have dreams.

01:18.987 --> 01:20.804
Yeah, so did I.

01:20.839 --> 01:22.639
Who did you dream about marrying?

01:25.928 --> 01:26.893
It'll come to you.

01:28.731 --> 01:31.765
So, the first thing Ben has to
do is take a paternity test.

01:33.652 --> 01:36.737
I mean, but it's pretty obvious she's his.

01:38.574 --> 01:40.824
Same smile. Same ears.

01:40.859 --> 01:43.827
Same little sparkly fleck
of yellow in the iris.

01:46.782 --> 01:48.532
What?

01:48.584 --> 01:49.616
Do I have something in my nose?

01:49.618 --> 01:51.701
I know you guys think that's funny,
but it's not.

01:51.754 --> 01:53.687
You like Ben.

01:53.722 --> 01:55.505
What?

01:55.541 --> 01:57.958
No, that's insane.
I tormented the guy every day of my life.

01:58.010 --> 02:00.627
Holy crap, you really do like Ben!

02:01.847 --> 02:04.548
I just can't stop thinking about him.

02:04.600 --> 02:06.049
Ever since he came back into my life,

02:06.101 --> 02:09.853
all of these old feelings from high
school just came bubbling back up.

02:09.888 --> 02:12.806
Only this time,
I think maybe he'll notice me now.

02:12.858 --> 02:15.609
You know, I'm not "Ri-Gantor" anymore.

02:15.644 --> 02:18.478
I'm not the fat girl that
used to sit on his head.

02:18.530 --> 02:20.814
So, what'd you think?

02:20.866 --> 02:23.567
I think you did a pretty amazing job.

02:23.619 --> 02:26.486
We did a pretty amazing job.

02:26.488 --> 02:27.571
Okay, me.

02:28.907 --> 02:29.873
Did you have fun tonight?

02:30.909 --> 02:32.659
I actually did.

02:32.661 --> 02:34.661
My only regret:

02:34.713 --> 02:36.580
I didn't get to dance
with the maid of honor.

02:36.632 --> 02:39.549
Well, the night isn't over yet.

02:43.639 --> 02:45.739
Ben Wheeler, you are a dead man!

02:45.774 --> 02:46.790
Riley, you're okay!

02:46.825 --> 02:49.609
No, no, no, I am not okay!

02:49.645 --> 02:52.279
By the time I finally
realized that you ditched me,

02:52.314 --> 02:55.048
I was in the Bronx. The Bronx, Ben.

02:55.083 --> 02:59.319
I had to beg people for money who
were already begging people for money.

03:00.289 --> 03:03.056
Look,
I have no idea what your whole plan was,

03:03.091 --> 03:05.058
but this is officially
the worst birthday ever!

03:17.256 --> 03:19.105
Okay.

03:19.141 --> 03:22.309
Officially the best birthday ever.

03:22.361 --> 03:24.911
I'm not moving too fast, am I?

03:24.947 --> 03:26.847
Ben...

03:26.882 --> 03:29.766
We've spent the last 20 years
getting to know each other.

03:29.818 --> 03:30.817
It's not too fast.

03:32.888 --> 03:34.621
I like the way you think.

03:34.656 --> 03:36.389
In fact,

03:36.425 --> 03:39.493
maybe we should move things into your room,

03:39.528 --> 03:41.144
and we can move too fast there?

03:42.397 --> 03:44.214
(Knocking)

03:44.249 --> 03:45.432
Just a second!

03:49.171 --> 03:50.136
Come in!

03:50.189 --> 03:51.838
Ben... aah!

03:51.874 --> 03:53.240
(Screaming)

03:54.910 --> 03:56.009
Angela, what are you doing here?

03:56.044 --> 03:58.778
Well, it's pretty clear what
you think I'm doing here.

03:58.814 --> 04:00.914
And I thought you were fast the first time.

04:00.949 --> 04:03.817
What are you doing? The shoes stay on!
You've got this all wrong!

04:03.852 --> 04:06.319
- But you said you wanted to start over?
- That wasn't for you!

04:06.355 --> 04:07.521
- That was for... Riley! Aah!
- Aah!

04:07.556 --> 04:08.622
What is going on here?

04:08.657 --> 04:10.290
Riley, it's not as bad as it looks!

04:10.325 --> 04:12.158
I can't even...

04:12.194 --> 04:13.326
Riley, no, wait!

04:14.496 --> 04:16.129
No, no, no, no, no, no!

04:16.130 --> 04:18.113
Please,
it's all just a big misunderstanding!

04:18.166 --> 04:19.866
Obviously I was in there waiting for you!

04:19.902 --> 04:21.301
Naked?

04:21.336 --> 04:23.920
Well, in the spirit of you showed me yours,
I thought I'd show you mine.

04:23.972 --> 04:25.071
All right.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.907
And, open your eyes.

04:28.577 --> 04:29.492
Oh, my God!

04:30.796 --> 04:31.745
Are you serious?

04:31.797 --> 04:34.347
Well, you said you felt safe there.

04:34.383 --> 04:36.383
This is my way of saying
you'll always be safe with me.

04:41.456 --> 04:43.473
How did you even get this up here?

04:43.525 --> 04:45.492
Blood, sweat, and a lot of Danny.

04:47.045 --> 04:49.095
And now, may I offer you a glass of...

04:49.131 --> 04:51.331
I managed to remember the tree house,
but actually forgot the wine.

04:51.333 --> 04:52.832
I'll be right back.

05:05.464 --> 05:08.682
I can't be in a relationship where
I'm constantly questioning everything.

05:08.717 --> 05:11.184
I always feel like I'm in second place.

05:12.588 --> 05:14.421
Wait...

05:14.456 --> 05:17.257
Are you breaking up with me?

05:17.292 --> 05:19.943
Because that's not fair!
I didn't do anything wrong!

05:19.978 --> 05:21.194
Can you look me in the eyes right now

05:21.229 --> 05:23.046
and tell me that you don't
have feelings for Danny?

05:23.098 --> 05:26.733
But,
I spent my whole life being in love with you.

05:26.735 --> 05:29.819
I mean, I never even had a minute to
think about how I feel about Danny.

05:29.855 --> 05:31.605
Maybe it's time you did.

05:34.443 --> 05:36.343
And maybe, we take a time-out while you do.

05:37.379 --> 05:38.712
- Ben...
- I'm sorry, Riley.

05:41.650 --> 05:46.052
I just... I don't know what else to do.

05:46.104 --> 05:48.054
I love you, but...

05:48.090 --> 05:50.223
Something just doesn't feel right.

05:53.128 --> 05:56.730
Okay. And we are done.

05:56.765 --> 05:58.431
Well, you may be done,

05:58.467 --> 06:00.867
but I still have to tell my mom that Danny
looks better in her dress than she does.

06:00.902 --> 06:02.702
Stop it.

06:02.738 --> 06:04.771
Your mom is going to be a beautiful bride.

06:07.426 --> 06:09.342
Not as beautiful as you'll be one day.

06:10.912 --> 06:12.545
I've been in love with her ever since
she first climbed into my tree house.

06:12.581 --> 06:15.332
I kinda just always thought she was...

06:15.367 --> 06:16.983
The one.

06:17.019 --> 06:19.069
But, she's never gonna see me that way,

06:19.104 --> 06:20.120
and I'm done.

06:20.155 --> 06:22.255
Well, honey, I am proud of you.

06:22.290 --> 06:24.140
I'm just glad I never
actually told her how I felt.

06:24.192 --> 06:26.092
Could have lost my best friend.

06:26.128 --> 06:28.978
Well, you didn't, and you're moving on.

06:29.031 --> 06:32.549
Yeah. I just don't think we'd
ever be the same if she knew.

06:32.601 --> 06:35.669
<i>If you are satisfied with
your message, press one.</i>

06:35.704 --> 06:38.672
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

06:38.707 --> 06:40.740
You must've hit Riley's number
when you took that picture!

06:40.776 --> 06:43.309
That is not possible. Give me that.

06:43.345 --> 06:44.477
(Phone beeps)

06:44.513 --> 06:45.478
<i>Message sent.</i>

06:45.514 --> 06:46.413
Mom!

06:47.449 --> 06:49.182
Come on, Danny, please wake up!

06:51.336 --> 06:52.302
Riley...

06:54.289 --> 06:56.072
Oh. And, I think he's back.

06:57.092 --> 06:58.792
- Danny.
- Riley!

06:58.827 --> 07:00.827
Oh!

07:01.963 --> 07:03.730
- Oh!
- Hi, good morning.

07:03.765 --> 07:04.981
Sorry, I didn't know you were here.

07:05.033 --> 07:06.633
Nothing happened.

07:06.668 --> 07:09.402
I just slept over. Like, as in sleep.

07:09.454 --> 07:12.439
Whatever. It's cool.

07:12.474 --> 07:14.340
I'm fine. Why wouldn't I be fine?

07:14.376 --> 07:16.576
You and Ben, Ben and you.
It's just like a dream come true.

07:16.578 --> 07:18.445
Hey, guys, crazy night, huh?

07:18.480 --> 07:19.546
What happened to you?

07:19.581 --> 07:21.314
You and Riley kind of just disappeared.

07:21.349 --> 07:24.017
I decided to make a bold and decisive move.

07:24.019 --> 07:25.969
I got Amy's name tattooed on my wrist.

07:26.004 --> 07:28.188
What! Are you serious?

07:28.223 --> 07:29.272
What do you think?

07:32.227 --> 07:34.794
Honestly, I don't think Amy's gonna like it.

07:38.533 --> 07:39.766
I'm really sorry about Riley.

07:39.801 --> 07:42.669
Don't be. It's all good.

07:42.704 --> 07:45.305
Riley might think she found
her knight in shining armor,

07:45.340 --> 07:47.407
but I know how this story ends. With me.

07:48.427 --> 07:50.143
I'm her prince charming.

07:52.130 --> 07:54.948
Then, to your happily ever after.

07:54.983 --> 07:55.949
(Bottles clink)

08:02.124 --> 08:03.890
Is everything okay?
Is something wrong with Emma?

08:03.925 --> 08:05.775
No. She's fine.

08:05.827 --> 08:06.860
It's you I was worried about.

08:06.895 --> 08:09.996
Oh, Danny, I'm fine.

08:10.031 --> 08:11.831
Why are you still in your tux?

08:13.502 --> 08:16.402
Because I don't believe
in giving up on dreams.

08:19.641 --> 08:21.441
Oh my God, Danny...

08:21.476 --> 08:23.209
This is so sweet, but...

08:23.245 --> 08:24.377
I'm not finished.

08:25.413 --> 08:26.379
(Music plays)

08:31.286 --> 08:32.852
I don't know what to say.

08:32.888 --> 08:34.953
Say you'll dance with me.

08:34.990 --> 08:37.724
Wait,
I almost forgot the most important part.

08:39.861 --> 08:41.995
That is not the most important part.

08:44.633 --> 08:47.567
You always being there for me is.

08:53.575 --> 08:56.409
You really are the best friend
a girl could ever ask for.

09:01.216 --> 09:03.216
Okay, let's get you out of this.

09:03.251 --> 09:04.184
She's coming!

09:04.219 --> 09:06.386
- Get it off me, get it off me!
- I'm trying!

09:06.421 --> 09:09.122
- Five, four, three...
- (Shouting)

09:09.157 --> 09:10.957
- Go, go, go!
- Two...

09:10.959 --> 09:12.992
Oh my God, what a surprise!

09:13.028 --> 09:14.828
(All talking)

09:14.863 --> 09:16.729
Get off me you bunch of weirdos!

09:18.133 --> 09:20.800
Hey, here, Riley.
It's your bridesmaid dress.

09:20.836 --> 09:23.436
Oh, and will you be my bridesmaid?

09:24.589 --> 09:26.439
I need somebody pretty
enough for the pictures,

09:26.474 --> 09:29.275
but not too pretty to steal my spotlight,
so...

09:30.345 --> 09:31.427
Good idea!

09:31.513 --> 09:33.279
Hey, Riley,
let's go try it on at your place, huh?

09:33.331 --> 09:34.581
- Oh, that's going to be fun!
- What?

09:34.616 --> 09:36.266
- So fun!
- Okay.

09:36.301 --> 09:37.467
Bye.

09:37.519 --> 09:38.985
Whew.

09:39.037 --> 09:40.286
I have bad news.

09:40.322 --> 09:42.922
Oh my God, Danny, did you rip it again?

09:42.958 --> 09:45.041
No. I knocked over the mouthwash.

09:46.261 --> 09:47.727
Oh...

09:47.729 --> 09:48.828
At least it's something blue.

09:51.667 --> 09:54.922
I don't know, I think scrubbing
it is making it worse.

09:55.371 --> 09:58.505
Maybe that's because I said not to scrub!

09:58.507 --> 10:01.108
Dab, Danny, dab!

10:01.110 --> 10:02.542
That is our only hope!

10:04.513 --> 10:06.179
She's beautiful when she's angry.

10:06.215 --> 10:09.116
Really? 'Cause I just see angry.

10:10.886 --> 10:13.070
Then again, I'm not the one
who's in love with her, you are.

10:14.840 --> 10:16.857
Please tell me I'm not really
watching you hit on Riley?

10:16.892 --> 10:18.859
Is it insane to think that
she could ever like me?

10:18.894 --> 10:21.428
If she did,
I'm sure she would have given you a sign.

10:21.463 --> 10:24.681
Hey, Ben, the law firm that I'm
interning for is having this big party,

10:24.717 --> 10:25.732
and we all get to bring dates.

10:25.768 --> 10:28.535
If you're asking me,
it's an unqualified yes.

10:28.537 --> 10:31.438
If that was just general information,
have a great time.

10:33.208 --> 10:34.141
I was asking.

10:34.176 --> 10:35.308
I'd love to.

10:35.344 --> 10:36.309
Great.

10:39.014 --> 10:40.897
And that is what we call a sign.

10:43.118 --> 10:45.719
Thank you so much for getting the tickets.
That's so sweet!

10:45.754 --> 10:48.672
I can't believe we have our own compartment.

10:48.707 --> 10:50.524
That is so...

10:50.559 --> 10:52.559
Just like you,

10:52.594 --> 10:53.877
because there's only one bed.

10:53.912 --> 10:56.530
Why is there only one bed?

10:56.565 --> 10:59.666
And what exactly did you think was
going to happen in this one bed?

10:59.702 --> 11:01.468
I'm sure it's just a mistake.

11:01.503 --> 11:03.303
I had nothing to do with this.

11:03.338 --> 11:05.305
Ah, Mr. Wheeler,

11:05.357 --> 11:07.374
the bed's been made up
just as you requested.

11:07.409 --> 11:11.278
Sounds like you and the Mrs. have
quite the romantic night planned.

11:12.247 --> 11:13.413
Romantic night?

11:13.449 --> 11:16.817
I don't know where he'd get
such an inappropriate idea.

11:16.852 --> 11:18.885
From your email?

11:18.921 --> 11:20.020
Ben Wheeler!

11:20.072 --> 11:23.557
I told you this train
wasn't going to sextown!

11:23.592 --> 11:24.825
God, you have a one track mind.

11:24.860 --> 11:28.628
Get out. Get out, get out, get out!
Oh, God, both of you!

11:29.648 --> 11:31.698
You were supposed to make
up the bed after dinner.

11:31.734 --> 11:33.667
It's dinnertime somewhere.

11:35.571 --> 11:41.291
(Tango music playing)

11:55.007 --> 11:56.790
Hey, we're pretty good together.

11:56.825 --> 11:58.458
I'm starting to believe that.

12:01.613 --> 12:05.565
So then, we agree.
It's best if we break up for good.

12:05.601 --> 12:06.650
Yeah, I...

12:09.521 --> 12:11.204
Wait, what?

12:12.441 --> 12:14.040
Well, you were right.

12:14.076 --> 12:15.375
I mean, this...

12:17.146 --> 12:18.311
This was a mistake.

12:20.082 --> 12:22.215
I think I loved you for so long,

12:22.251 --> 12:24.868
I actually willed you into loving me back.

12:24.903 --> 12:28.655
You know, I just took you along for my ride.

12:29.825 --> 12:31.708
And the truth is...

12:31.760 --> 12:33.810
We'll always be better as friends.

12:36.732 --> 12:38.365
You agree, right?

12:39.568 --> 12:41.401
Yeah.

12:41.436 --> 12:43.069
Friends, totally.

12:44.106 --> 12:46.006
Ben, oh my God...

12:46.041 --> 12:48.275
Ben, what are you doing here?

12:48.277 --> 12:50.343
I'm not allowed to have boys over.

12:50.379 --> 12:52.913
Riley, you can't run away from home.

12:52.948 --> 12:54.915
Well, run away to home...

12:54.933 --> 12:56.082
From your home. Whatever.

12:56.118 --> 12:58.034
Riley, you can't run away from me.

12:58.086 --> 12:59.853
Ben, haven't I done enough damage...

12:59.888 --> 13:02.589
(Both screaming)

13:02.658 --> 13:04.441
You have now!

13:04.476 --> 13:07.344
Deep down,
there's no one more competitive than Riley.

13:07.379 --> 13:08.728
She tries to keep it under control,
but you know what?

13:08.764 --> 13:11.531
I think we owe it to Ross to
show him what's really inside

13:11.567 --> 13:16.069
that super cute exterior with those
beautiful eyes, and that kicky haircut.

13:20.959 --> 13:22.943
You really aren't over her, are you?

13:22.945 --> 13:24.845
Not even close.

13:26.849 --> 13:28.915
Well, I don't see any more blue,

13:28.951 --> 13:31.885
so feel free to throw the word
"genius" around.

13:31.920 --> 13:33.720
I need my dress.

13:33.755 --> 13:35.755
- Mom!
- Is it in your room?

13:35.757 --> 13:38.658
Uh, no! Don't go in there, Emma's sleeping.

13:38.694 --> 13:41.294
Okay. All right, I'll just come back.

13:43.432 --> 13:44.331
Where is it?

13:44.333 --> 13:45.498
I put it on the fire escape.

13:48.303 --> 13:50.270
Or, I did put it on the fire escape...

13:54.877 --> 13:56.760
Oh! Oh, now I see it.

13:56.812 --> 13:57.777
(Horns honking)

13:57.813 --> 13:58.745
(Tires screeching)

13:58.780 --> 13:59.779
(All gasp)

14:05.773 --> 14:07.706
Well, we could dye it black.

14:07.742 --> 14:10.609
You know that way she has something to
wear to our funerals when she kills us.

14:11.879 --> 14:15.448
Brad won't notice. I mean, that
dude is clearly blinded by love.

14:15.500 --> 14:16.782
I love love.

14:16.801 --> 14:18.651
I do too.

14:18.686 --> 14:20.653
I just wish it loved me back.

14:22.290 --> 14:24.356
Someday you'll find a guy
who truly appreciates you.

14:24.392 --> 14:27.059
A guy who can look in your heart
and know what you're thinking.

14:31.265 --> 14:32.865
Yeah, okay.

14:32.900 --> 14:35.034
Well, this fort was everything to me.

14:35.069 --> 14:37.837
I mean, when I was up here,
everything was perfect.

14:37.872 --> 14:41.857
I didn't hate my mom,
I wasn't fat, I had friends.

14:41.909 --> 14:43.742
You had Danny.

14:43.778 --> 14:45.678
Well, he was enough.

14:48.382 --> 14:49.331
Hi.

14:50.651 --> 14:52.251
What the hell is going on?

14:52.286 --> 14:55.354
What's so important that you
have to interrupt my date. Twice.

14:55.389 --> 14:57.189
Oh, okay, calm down.

14:57.225 --> 15:00.342
I just came here to warn you that
Robyn is just using you as a rebound

15:00.378 --> 15:01.427
to get over her ex.

15:01.462 --> 15:03.229
I know. I'm fine with that.

15:03.281 --> 15:04.830
We talked about it last night.

15:04.882 --> 15:06.298
Seriously, what's going on?

15:06.334 --> 15:08.184
How come every time I have a girl in my life

15:08.236 --> 15:09.835
you get overprotective and weird.

15:09.871 --> 15:11.904
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do!

15:11.939 --> 15:13.606
You kind of act like a jealous girlfriend.

15:13.641 --> 15:14.707
Oh, well, I'm sorry.

15:14.759 --> 15:16.942
That's what friends do.
They protect each other.

15:16.978 --> 15:18.744
No, friends are supportive.

15:18.779 --> 15:19.795
But you with...

15:19.847 --> 15:22.531
With Milena, and Amy, and Georgie,

15:22.567 --> 15:24.416
it's like no one's ever good enough for me.

15:24.418 --> 15:26.318
I just care about you.

15:26.387 --> 15:29.355
If you cared about me,
you'd stop doing whatever the hell this is.

15:29.390 --> 15:31.190
- Danny, I just...
- What?

15:31.192 --> 15:32.157
You got feelings for me now?

15:33.261 --> 15:35.261
No. Exactly.

15:35.296 --> 15:36.996
So, let me get back to my date.

15:38.216 --> 15:40.666
- Danny...
- What?

15:47.875 --> 15:49.642
I do have feelings for you.

15:52.413 --> 15:53.562
Oh, my God.

15:53.598 --> 15:55.581
What's happening right now?

15:55.616 --> 15:57.616
Why can't I just tell him that I like him?

15:58.619 --> 16:00.269
Wait, wait...

16:00.354 --> 16:03.355
Wait, are you saying that you
finally realized that you like Danny?

16:06.394 --> 16:08.260
Well, congratulations!

16:08.296 --> 16:11.263
You're officially the last to know!

16:11.265 --> 16:15.017
No. No, actually,
Danny is the last one to know.

16:15.052 --> 16:17.820
And Tucker, I have to tell him.

16:17.855 --> 16:20.623
I will not keep my feelings
bottled up this time!

16:20.675 --> 16:21.807
Hi, I really need to talk to you.

16:21.859 --> 16:23.976
Now? I'm kind of in the
middle of something.

16:24.011 --> 16:25.578
Oh, come on!

16:25.580 --> 16:27.513
If I don't tell you now,
I think I'm gonna explode.

16:27.548 --> 16:30.416
Okay. Go ahead, I'm ready.

16:30.468 --> 16:31.483
Danny,

16:31.519 --> 16:33.586
(inaudible) (Crowd yells)

16:33.621 --> 16:35.621
I didn't totally get that.

16:35.623 --> 16:36.622
Danny,

16:36.624 --> 16:38.440
(crowd yells again)

16:38.492 --> 16:39.525
One more time.

16:39.527 --> 16:41.226
(Crowd yelling)

16:41.262 --> 16:43.195
I think I'm in love with you!

16:44.265 --> 16:46.098
(Crowd still shouting)

16:47.184 --> 16:50.069
Really? Are you sure?

16:50.121 --> 16:53.038
I mean, I don't want to say
anything to change your mind.

16:53.074 --> 16:55.591
Because, you know,
I like what you're saying.

16:56.894 --> 16:58.978
Riley, I've been in love with you
for as long as I can remember.

17:01.799 --> 17:03.515
I know.

17:03.567 --> 17:05.617
I'm just so glad that
I finally figured out...

17:05.653 --> 17:07.353
(Buzzer sounds)

17:08.723 --> 17:10.656
Wait, what do you mean, "you know"?

17:12.460 --> 17:14.193
Well, last year,

17:14.228 --> 17:16.494
I heard that voice mail
that you accidentally left,

17:16.530 --> 17:18.464
saying that you'd been in love
with me for your whole life.

17:18.499 --> 17:21.000
- Man: Wheeler, let's go!
- Okay, okay! I really think they need you.

17:21.035 --> 17:22.067
You knew?

17:22.086 --> 17:24.103
You knew all this time,
and you didn't say anything?

17:24.137 --> 17:25.904
Danny, I didn't know what to say.

17:25.940 --> 17:28.207
So, you just left me hanging
out there like an idiot?

17:28.209 --> 17:30.109
Did my feelings mean that little to you?

17:30.144 --> 17:32.745
- Man: Wheeler, come on!
- Okay, I'm coming!

17:32.780 --> 17:34.847
No! No, no, no, no, no!

17:34.882 --> 17:36.732
Danny, Danny, wait! Danny!

17:38.919 --> 17:41.837
I can't even begin to tell you
how many times you broke my heart.

17:41.889 --> 17:44.523
Get off of me!

17:44.558 --> 17:47.493
I'm here now!
That has to count for something!

17:47.528 --> 17:48.627
It doesn't.

17:48.679 --> 17:50.462
Danny, I didn't mean to hurt you.

17:50.498 --> 17:53.365
Well, the girl I've loved my whole life
never would have treated me this way.

17:53.417 --> 17:54.350
I don't even know who you are?

17:57.071 --> 17:59.004
Danny! Danny!

17:59.056 --> 18:00.272
Ugh.

18:03.144 --> 18:05.044
Tucker, ugh.

18:06.147 --> 18:08.814
It's the universal sign
for someone in distress.

18:08.816 --> 18:11.967
And not making eye contact
is the universal sign for

18:12.019 --> 18:14.453
leave me alone, I am blowing stuff up.

18:16.857 --> 18:19.375
Danny is completely avoiding me.

18:19.410 --> 18:22.394
God, I just want things to go
back to the way they used to be.

18:22.430 --> 18:24.196
(Music plays)

19:23.324 --> 19:24.490
Whoo, we did it!

19:24.492 --> 19:26.291
We found almost the exact same
dress at the bridal store.

19:26.327 --> 19:28.544
It's white, it's poofy, it's perfect.

19:28.579 --> 19:30.295
Oh, here she comes!

19:30.331 --> 19:31.497
Everybody look nonchalant!

19:37.471 --> 19:39.638
All right, I need help picking the cake,
and I thought you guys...

19:39.673 --> 19:40.639
- Aah!
- Oh, my God!

19:40.674 --> 19:41.740
Oh my God, mom!

19:41.776 --> 19:43.509
- No!
- Oh...

19:46.647 --> 19:49.398
But we took such perfect care of it!

19:49.433 --> 19:52.484
Mom, don't worry,
you're gonna have a beautiful wedding.

19:52.520 --> 19:54.686
And you're gonna be a beautiful
bride no matter what you're wearing.

19:54.688 --> 19:57.689
Well, then it's a good thing
I'm not wearing that dress.

19:57.741 --> 19:59.608
I just found a way better one online.

19:59.660 --> 20:03.362
(All yelling in disbelief)

20:06.037 --> 20:09.653
So, I'm probably gonna be the
next one to get married, right?

20:09.753 --> 20:11.837
- Haha, not a chance.
- Yeah, right.

20:11.839 --> 20:14.723
(All disagree)

20:14.758 --> 20:17.592
- Call me.
- I guess I pick Tucker.

20:17.644 --> 20:21.646
Just kick back, relax,
and let Tucker do the climbing.

20:21.682 --> 20:23.648
Hey, babe. How'd you sleep?

20:23.684 --> 20:25.684
I'll let you know after I get some sleep.

20:25.686 --> 20:29.020
I don't know what it is. Katrinka
and I just fit so perfectly together.

20:29.022 --> 20:30.856
I'm Tucker Dobbs,

20:30.858 --> 20:33.658
and I think you'll find me just right.

20:39.700 --> 20:41.733
You don't want to sleep with me?

20:41.768 --> 20:43.919
I never said that.
