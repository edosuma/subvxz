WEBVTT

00:02.078 --> 00:04.696
This is Hulk Hogan, the heavyweight
wrestling champion of the world.

00:04.762 --> 00:06.073
What's going on around here?

00:06.133 --> 00:07.866
Harry "The Hammer" Sullivan.

00:08.287 --> 00:09.618
Yeah, I remember you.

00:09.645 --> 00:12.246
I want Harry,
or your friends are dead.

00:12.280 --> 00:13.914
Where's that
creep, Harry, holed up?

00:13.966 --> 00:15.874
We think he hangs out
at this youth center.

00:15.921 --> 00:17.876
I'm here to visit
Harry Sullivan.

00:17.968 --> 00:19.378
They'll never catch him.

00:20.281 --> 00:22.923
We want Harry back,
or you're dead.

00:22.978 --> 00:25.300
I'm gonna blow Harry the
Hammer, away myself.

00:26.217 --> 00:30.180
This Harry Sullivan
sure is a popular fellow.

00:31.682 --> 00:34.351
<i>In 1972,
a crack commando unit...</i>

00:34.434 --> 00:36.145
<i>was sent to prison
by a military court...</i>

00:36.228 --> 00:37.688
<i>for a crime they didn't commit.</i>

00:37.771 --> 00:38.939
<i>These men promptly escaped...</i>

00:39.022 --> 00:40.566
<i>from a
maximum-security stockade...</i>

00:40.691 --> 00:42.276
<i>to the Los Angeles underground.</i>

00:42.359 --> 00:43.902
<i>Today, still wanted
by the government...</i>

00:43.986 --> 00:45.946
<i>they survive
as soldiers of fortune.</i>

00:46.029 --> 00:48.490
<i>If you have a problem,
if no one else can help...</i>

00:48.574 --> 00:49.825
<i>and if you can find them...</i>

00:49.908 --> 00:52.327
<i>maybe you can hire the A-Team.</i>

02:47.276 --> 02:49.027
Someone wants to talk to you.

02:50.320 --> 02:52.239
I've nothing to say to you...

02:53.156 --> 02:54.408
or your brother.

03:29.651 --> 03:31.445
Been looking all over
for you, Harry.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.282
I got nothing
to say to you, Noodles.

03:35.991 --> 03:37.326
You know what I think?

03:37.951 --> 03:40.203
I think we should
waste him right here.

03:41.330 --> 03:42.456
He's a hardhead.

03:43.123 --> 03:44.916
He don't know the score.

03:45.083 --> 03:46.752
Want to know
what I think, Richie?

03:47.544 --> 03:49.046
I think you're crazy.

03:49.296 --> 03:52.424
I think you ought to get your head shrunk.
That's what I think.

03:57.763 --> 04:00.057
Hey, quit acting crazy.

04:00.223 --> 04:02.517
And you, is that any way
to treat a business partner?

04:02.601 --> 04:05.228
I ain't throwing the fight,
Noodles, so you can forget it.

04:05.687 --> 04:07.272
You know
what your problem is, Harry?

04:07.356 --> 04:08.940
It's that
you're too bloody noble.

04:09.066 --> 04:12.611
You know, you ain't never gonna make it in
this world unless you cut a few corners.

04:13.028 --> 04:15.322
Maybe I should write that
down, you know, Noodles.

04:15.405 --> 04:16.322
All right.

04:17.574 --> 04:20.118
You don't fight for us,
you don't fight.

04:20.619 --> 04:22.036
Break his hands.

07:18.463 --> 07:19.631
Hey, kid.

07:22.384 --> 07:25.220
Where's the guy? Where's
the guy who lives here?

07:25.720 --> 07:27.889
- Who are you?
- We're the Avon ladies.

07:28.181 --> 07:29.266
Where's Harry?

07:29.432 --> 07:30.392
I don't know.

07:30.475 --> 07:33.395
I haven't seen him for days.
He took off.

07:33.853 --> 07:35.981
Your old man
used to be a fighter, right?

07:37.232 --> 07:38.358
What's it to you?

08:13.602 --> 08:16.980
No, just let him go.
We'll pick him up later.

08:19.065 --> 08:20.358
You could've given me
the contract.

08:20.442 --> 08:22.319
I could have given the stuff
back to the Hulk.

08:22.360 --> 08:24.070
We got to
talk to him, B.A.

08:24.237 --> 08:25.363
Is it bad?

08:25.947 --> 08:28.158
'Cause I told him you know all
about this Hollywood stuff.

08:28.199 --> 08:29.576
Is it a bad deal
for the Hulkster?

08:29.659 --> 08:31.328
No, it's a pretty good deal.

08:31.786 --> 08:33.121
What about the script?

08:33.621 --> 08:34.956
The script's not bad.

08:35.039 --> 08:37.167
And a lot of good
wrestling stuff in it.

08:37.792 --> 08:40.503
Thanks, Hannibal. I really
appreciate you doing me this favor.

08:57.187 --> 08:58.772
Listen, B.A.,
I gotta run.

08:58.938 --> 09:00.398
I was just fixing your bike.

09:01.274 --> 09:02.275
Forget it.

09:02.359 --> 09:03.985
Don't you want
your wheels fixed?

09:04.235 --> 09:06.071
Look, maybe I can
come back for it.

09:06.363 --> 09:08.156
Ten minutes.
Don't you have 10 minutes?

09:09.074 --> 09:10.659
Yeah, sure. Okay.

09:10.784 --> 09:12.786
You wanna tell me about
that scratch on your head?

09:13.870 --> 09:15.622
Got it when I totaled the bike.

09:15.705 --> 09:17.290
I hit the wall pretty good.

09:17.874 --> 09:19.042
Yeah, sure.

09:19.125 --> 09:20.710
I'm telling you the truth.

09:20.835 --> 09:23.213
You better be.
What's going on at home?

09:23.338 --> 09:24.839
Why you sleeping in the center?

09:24.923 --> 09:26.633
Just decided to camp out.

09:27.175 --> 09:28.426
How your father doing?

09:28.551 --> 09:30.345
I haven't seen that bum
for days.

09:30.512 --> 09:32.097
He took off.
Who needs him?

09:32.305 --> 09:34.265
Hey, Jeffrey,
let's show a little respect.

09:34.349 --> 09:35.767
That ain't no way
to talk about your father.

09:35.850 --> 09:37.394
The guy doesn't respect me.

09:37.477 --> 09:40.480
He doesn't see anything but the
bottom of a bottle all day long.

09:40.563 --> 09:42.899
It's been like that
ever since Mom died.

10:05.463 --> 10:08.091
How you doing, man?
All right.

10:08.299 --> 10:10.844
Whoa, B.A. All right.
How's it going?

10:11.010 --> 10:13.388
All right. Man.

10:14.097 --> 10:15.181
All right.

10:18.810 --> 10:21.062
I have to run.
I gotta go deliver my papers.

10:21.146 --> 10:22.564
You ain't gonna stick around
for the Hulkster?

10:22.647 --> 10:23.857
He's gonna be talking
to the whole center.

10:23.940 --> 10:27.527
I should get home. My dad might be there.
Thanks again.

10:32.615 --> 10:35.326
Kid's laying a story on you, B.A.
How well do you know him?

10:35.410 --> 10:36.327
Pretty well.

10:36.411 --> 10:38.204
He been coming around the
center for about six months.

10:38.288 --> 10:39.622
Ever since he moved in town.

10:39.706 --> 10:41.541
He acts like
he's got big trouble.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.293
I think we should follow him.

10:43.418 --> 10:44.794
Maybe you're right, Hannibal.

10:45.295 --> 10:48.173
Why don't you go ahead and start with
the kids while we go check this out?

10:48.256 --> 10:50.717
No, we'll all go. We can
take the limo. Great.

10:52.844 --> 10:54.967
All right, kids,
you all finish the game.

10:54.992 --> 10:56.218
We got a little business
to take care of.

10:56.243 --> 10:57.724
- We'll be back in a few minutes.
- Okay.

11:03.438 --> 11:04.522
Move over.

11:04.606 --> 11:06.274
Hey, man, let Arnold drive.

11:06.357 --> 11:07.484
I'm driving.

11:25.168 --> 11:26.461
There he is.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.631
Hey, Hannibal, that ain't
the way to his house.

11:29.714 --> 11:31.674
This is a terrible
neighborhood, B.A.

11:32.592 --> 11:34.219
Yeah, something's going on.

11:34.886 --> 11:36.221
Who you calling, Hannibal?

11:38.723 --> 11:41.601
I really can't stand it when somebody
lets a phone ring like that.

11:41.684 --> 11:44.562
- Will you please answer it?
- Absolutely not.

11:46.564 --> 11:48.566
There, see.
We missed it.

11:48.900 --> 11:51.194
Face, what does my hair look like?
You know how sensitive I am.

11:51.277 --> 11:53.738
Don't worry, Murdock, don't worry.
You look great.

11:53.822 --> 11:56.491
It's true. You know, there is
something about brand-new clothes...

11:56.574 --> 11:58.201
just makes you just
wanna stand up and shine.

11:58.368 --> 12:01.037
Well, stand up and shine
on somebody else's seats.

12:12.382 --> 12:15.635
Murdock, these girls
are gonna love us.

12:17.762 --> 12:19.264
Which one of them is mine?

12:19.305 --> 12:20.473
It's Rikki.

12:21.683 --> 12:23.977
The one on the left
there looks like a Rikki.

12:24.060 --> 12:25.645
Is she the pretty one? 'Cause
I want the pretty one.

12:25.728 --> 12:27.981
Murdock,
they're identical twins.

12:28.064 --> 12:29.148
Now, look...

12:29.774 --> 12:33.278
Vikki wouldn't go out with me until I
found a date for her sister, okay?

12:33.361 --> 12:34.404
That's where you come in.

12:34.487 --> 12:36.823
That's why I bought you
these beautiful clothes.

12:36.906 --> 12:38.283
I don't know about this, Face.

12:38.366 --> 12:40.451
I mean, girl who's interested
in money and clothes...

12:40.535 --> 12:43.580
I mean, I don't know whether, you know,
she'll satisfy my intellectual needs.

12:43.872 --> 12:45.373
Well, what a shame.

12:45.456 --> 12:47.542
Just remember, be cool, okay.

12:47.625 --> 12:51.462
With any luck, we are looking
at a weekend in Cancun.

12:51.546 --> 12:55.842
I would love to show the girls the Mayan
pyramids of the Yucatan, I'll tell you.

12:59.721 --> 13:02.557
- No. Absolutely not. Don't--
- Absolutely yes. Hello.

13:02.640 --> 13:03.600
Let me talk to Face.

13:03.683 --> 13:05.685
- It's for you.
- Yeah.

13:05.768 --> 13:07.478
Hi, Face.
How's it going?

13:07.562 --> 13:08.938
Fine, until you called.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.189
Maybe I should go in
and say hello.

13:10.273 --> 13:11.274
No, you don't.
Stay right there.

13:11.357 --> 13:12.567
Stay right where you are.
Don't move.

13:12.901 --> 13:14.569
Not you, Hannibal.

13:14.652 --> 13:15.778
We need a little help.

13:15.862 --> 13:20.658
I want you to check out
11224 Marshall Boulevard.

13:20.742 --> 13:22.660
See if you can locate
a Harry Sullivan.

13:22.744 --> 13:24.495
Who's Harry Sullivan?

13:24.662 --> 13:26.570
<i>He's the father of a kid
we think is in trouble.</i>

13:26.595 --> 13:28.708
- Who's we?
- Me, B.A., and the Hulkster.

13:28.833 --> 13:30.668
What's B.A. doing?
Why can't he--

13:30.752 --> 13:31.836
Thanks, Face.

13:34.422 --> 13:37.300
We gotta swing by and pick
up some kid's father.

13:37.383 --> 13:39.218
I'll go tell the girls.
Okay.

13:44.974 --> 13:47.268
Be right back. Good.

13:54.275 --> 13:56.069
You never should have
answered that telephone.

14:14.128 --> 14:15.296
Dad?

14:17.173 --> 14:18.299
Dad.

14:20.343 --> 14:21.803
Dad, you okay?

14:21.886 --> 14:24.305
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:26.307 --> 14:27.725
Yeah, I'm all right.

14:28.559 --> 14:30.895
Give me that bottle.
You don't need a drink, Dad.

14:30.979 --> 14:33.022
Don't tell me what I don't need.

14:39.028 --> 14:41.990
Where's our money? Did you get the
money to Fats and get our end?

14:42.073 --> 14:45.451
I didn't get a chance to make the drop.
There were guys following me.

14:45.576 --> 14:47.996
You didn't make the drop?
What, are you crazy?

14:48.079 --> 14:49.831
How are we supposed to get paid?

15:06.806 --> 15:09.767
Hey, there were guys all over
the street looking for you.

15:09.934 --> 15:11.519
They jumped me at the house.

15:11.602 --> 15:12.520
Mmm.

15:13.813 --> 15:15.773
Well, they're never
gonna find me here.

15:15.898 --> 15:16.983
What did you do with the money?

15:17.066 --> 15:19.777
I stashed it in that abandoned
Plymouth behind Third Street.

15:19.861 --> 15:22.196
You never let the money
out of your sight.

15:22.280 --> 15:24.449
That's $10,000 in there.

15:33.082 --> 15:34.709
Hold it right there, pal.

15:34.792 --> 15:36.085
Jeffrey, you all right?

15:36.169 --> 15:38.463
Don't hurt him, please.
That's my dad.

15:38.546 --> 15:40.590
What's going on?
Who are these guys?

15:41.090 --> 15:43.051
Crazy Richie sent you,
didn't he?

15:43.384 --> 15:44.969
I'll blow you away right now.

15:45.094 --> 15:47.013
We don't know any Crazy Richie.

15:47.180 --> 15:48.806
Just take it easy.

15:49.265 --> 15:51.559
We're friends of Jeffrey.
We followed him here.

15:51.642 --> 15:53.770
I told you not to let
anybody follow you.

15:55.646 --> 15:57.273
Jeffrey, tell him who we are.

15:58.399 --> 16:00.109
Hey, maybe they could help us.

16:00.193 --> 16:01.944
We don't need nobody's help.

16:03.071 --> 16:05.156
Your dad's real sick, Jeffrey.

16:08.409 --> 16:10.036
Who the hell
do you think you are?

16:10.119 --> 16:12.038
We're the guys that are gonna
take you to the hospital.

16:12.080 --> 16:13.039
No.

16:13.122 --> 16:14.707
No, no. No hospital.

16:15.666 --> 16:17.085
Forget it.

16:17.585 --> 16:18.753
They're after me.

16:18.836 --> 16:20.379
These guys are after him.

16:21.297 --> 16:23.007
B.A.,
you gotta do something.

16:32.517 --> 16:33.559
Harry?

16:44.320 --> 16:45.363
They certainly wouldn't win...

16:45.446 --> 16:47.573
any Good Housekeeping
Seals of Approval.

16:47.657 --> 16:48.699
Where's Harry?

16:50.785 --> 16:53.663
Harry? Who's Harry?

16:53.746 --> 16:56.249
Come on. Someone wants
to talk to you.

16:56.332 --> 16:57.375
Yeah.

16:58.126 --> 17:00.628
I got it.
The twins sent you, right?

17:01.462 --> 17:03.256
You know, Rikki and Vikki.

17:04.132 --> 17:06.008
We want our $10,000.

17:06.092 --> 17:07.300
What $10,000?

17:11.722 --> 17:13.516
Come on, man,
that's a brand-new outfit.

17:38.207 --> 17:40.042
Now, where's my $10,000?

17:40.751 --> 17:43.379
Yeah, look, we're running
a little late here...

17:43.462 --> 17:44.797
You boys are coming with us.

17:45.089 --> 17:47.967
We want Harry back,
or you're dead.

17:48.759 --> 17:51.387
You never should have
answered that telephone.

17:58.102 --> 17:59.562
Where the hell is he?

17:59.687 --> 18:02.940
We don't know. We tracked down
his kid, but he bolted on us.

18:03.024 --> 18:05.026
If you hadn't lost the kid, he
might've led you to the old man.

18:05.109 --> 18:06.235
I'm sorry, Mr. Ifker.

18:06.277 --> 18:07.570
You sure it was Harry Sullivan?

18:07.653 --> 18:08.821
Yeah, it was him.

18:08.905 --> 18:12.408
He was drunk in the bar bragging about
his days as a fighter in Chicago.

18:12.575 --> 18:15.578
Then he starts mouthing off about some
guy he killed with his bare hands.

18:15.745 --> 18:17.663
What's all the yelling?
You all right, Richie?

18:24.545 --> 18:27.381
I'm fine.
I just got a little excited.

18:27.548 --> 18:29.300
Could you excuse us
for a minute?

18:29.383 --> 18:31.844
Sure. I'll have Consuela
pick up the kids at school.

18:31.928 --> 18:34.180
Good idea, good idea. We'll all
go out for dinner tonight.

18:34.263 --> 18:35.264
All right.

18:42.271 --> 18:44.315
Where does the kid go to school?
Where does he hang out?

18:44.607 --> 18:46.943
We think he hangs out
at this youth center.

18:47.068 --> 18:48.152
Check it out.

18:48.319 --> 18:49.779
I want you on this full time.

18:49.862 --> 18:51.072
This is top priority.

18:51.155 --> 18:53.157
What about the shipment
at the pier?

18:55.868 --> 18:57.912
Don't worry about that,
it's all in gear.

18:58.037 --> 18:59.997
I want you two
to find Harry Sullivan...

19:00.248 --> 19:02.250
if it means kicking over
every drunk in LA.

19:02.333 --> 19:04.543
I wanna know where
that creep is holed up!

19:04.710 --> 19:06.629
Where's that
creep, Harry, holed up?

19:06.712 --> 19:10.508
Look, all I know is the guy
is three months behind...

19:10.591 --> 19:12.301
on his payment
on the refrigerator--

19:12.385 --> 19:13.552
Oh, bull.

19:13.803 --> 19:15.638
Now, who you guys working for?

19:16.430 --> 19:19.183
Did Roscoe Ragland send you in
here to move in on my territory?

19:19.267 --> 19:22.728
- Man, we don't know no Roscoe Ragland.
- No.

19:25.940 --> 19:27.525
We'll see about that.

19:30.027 --> 19:31.028
Thank you, Styles.

19:31.112 --> 19:32.405
Maybe we ought
to tell him, Face.

19:32.530 --> 19:33.239
Shut up!

19:33.322 --> 19:34.448
Tell me what?

19:34.532 --> 19:36.325
I'm gonna spill it.
I'm gonna tell him all!

19:36.409 --> 19:38.828
You're gonna end up dead.
I'm gonna tell him anyway.

19:38.911 --> 19:42.540
- We work for Speedy Smith.
- Oh, no.

19:42.623 --> 19:43.666
I never heard of him.

19:43.708 --> 19:45.751
That's because you ain't pushing
candy in Beverly Hills.

19:45.876 --> 19:48.045
We work out of
a fleet of limousines.

19:48.129 --> 19:49.380
By appointment only.

19:49.463 --> 19:50.965
Well, what you messing
around with Harry for?

19:51.048 --> 19:53.342
We got a call.
Couple of guys...

19:53.426 --> 19:57.430
they had $10,000, they wanted to
double it in a couple of days.

19:57.555 --> 20:01.892
With my $10,000? I will
kill that low life bum.

20:17.325 --> 20:18.784
Thank you, Styles.

20:23.706 --> 20:25.750
This guy's going
into shock, Hannibal.

20:26.042 --> 20:27.668
Help him with those blankets.
Keep him warm.

20:27.752 --> 20:30.379
Hey, what's happening?
He's never done this before.

20:30.463 --> 20:31.881
He had too much
to drink, Jeffrey.

20:31.964 --> 20:34.467
There's no heat in there. How
long has he been in that place?

20:34.592 --> 20:36.969
Just two nights.
Just two nights.

20:39.597 --> 20:40.306
Yeah.

20:40.389 --> 20:43.684
Speedy.
We never did find Harry.

20:43.768 --> 20:45.478
We did.
You did?

20:45.895 --> 20:48.356
Good. Now I want
my money back. Put him on.

20:48.439 --> 20:49.940
He's indisposed at the moment.

20:50.107 --> 20:51.776
Now, you listen up, Speedball.

20:51.859 --> 20:54.695
We get our $10,000 back,
or we plant your friends.

20:54.779 --> 20:56.030
We need more time.

20:56.113 --> 20:57.323
You got 30 minutes.

20:57.406 --> 21:01.535
Now, you bring that cash to Fats' Brown
Derby Nightclub on Fourth Street.

21:09.710 --> 21:12.797
Okay. B.A., you and Jeffrey
check Harry into the hospital.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.215
Hulk and I will get the money.

21:14.757 --> 21:16.675
The limo's right behind us.
We can take that.

21:16.759 --> 21:18.052
Good.
Where's the money, Jeffrey?

21:18.177 --> 21:21.430
In an abandoned car in an alley
behind Third and Alvarado.

21:21.555 --> 21:23.099
A maroon Plymouth.

21:23.682 --> 21:26.227
Here. You can pop
the trunk with this.

21:28.562 --> 21:30.648
I think we've got everything
ready, Mr. Perry.

21:30.731 --> 21:31.774
Call me Fridge.

21:31.857 --> 21:33.025
Fine, Mr. Fridge.

21:33.150 --> 21:35.736
Now, I've selected a nice,
quiet room for you.

21:35.820 --> 21:37.947
Good. And we'll make
sure that you're not...

21:38.531 --> 21:39.490
bothered.

21:39.949 --> 21:41.200
Out of the way!

21:45.329 --> 21:46.956
Does this man have insurance?

21:47.790 --> 21:49.583
Here, will this pay for it?

21:50.376 --> 21:52.086
Out of the way, emergency!

22:03.180 --> 22:06.725
He's gonna die.
My dad's gonna die.

22:07.017 --> 22:09.562
I didn't mean all those things
I said about him, I swear.

22:09.645 --> 22:12.606
Calm down, Jeffrey, everything will be
all right. You just gotta hang in there.

22:12.773 --> 22:14.817
You know, I just didn't
want anyone to find him...

22:14.942 --> 22:17.194
and now I'm getting everyone
in more and more trouble.

22:17.278 --> 22:18.654
Don't worry.
They'll get the money.

22:18.737 --> 22:20.156
Everything will be all right.

22:48.434 --> 22:50.102
The car was supposed
to be right here.

22:50.186 --> 22:52.354
They must be towing off
all the wrecks in the alley.

22:53.105 --> 22:54.231
It's not good.

22:54.356 --> 22:55.733
When it goes south, man...

22:55.858 --> 22:57.401
Come on,
we haven't got much time.

23:07.119 --> 23:07.953
Talk to me.

23:08.037 --> 23:10.164
Now, look, pal, we gotta have
more than half an hour.

23:10.706 --> 23:12.791
- You got six minutes.
- We got the money.

23:12.917 --> 23:14.752
Yeah, we shifted it
for safekeeping.

23:14.877 --> 23:17.880
Five-and-a-half minutes. You're
wasting valuable time, Speedball.

23:17.963 --> 23:19.256
Can I talk to my friend?

23:24.845 --> 23:25.930
Can he hear me?

23:26.013 --> 23:27.181
No way.

23:27.389 --> 23:29.099
We got a little trouble.
The money moved.

23:29.225 --> 23:31.894
Good. How long will it take
to get it back?

23:32.144 --> 23:33.604
I don't know
if we can get it back.

23:33.687 --> 23:36.607
Great! Great!

23:36.982 --> 23:40.819
So, if you and Face can find a way
out of there, don't wait for us.

23:41.654 --> 23:43.822
Boy, am I glad to hear that!

23:44.907 --> 23:45.866
Yeah.

23:47.034 --> 23:48.327
Everything's great.

23:48.452 --> 23:49.620
That's great.

23:49.703 --> 23:52.498
Gentlemen, they would
like to meet us...

23:52.790 --> 23:56.293
at Alvarado and Sixth.

23:56.627 --> 24:00.172
They got your dough.
No problem.

24:01.006 --> 24:01.840
It's great.

24:01.924 --> 24:02.841
Great.

24:03.509 --> 24:05.177
- Great.
- Great.

24:06.220 --> 24:08.847
Say, listen, we're supposed
to meet somebody for dinner.

24:08.889 --> 24:10.224
Do you mind if I...

24:12.101 --> 24:13.477
No. I guess not.

24:24.822 --> 24:28.242
Okay. I gotta get the money
out of the trunk.

24:28.826 --> 24:31.495
You go over there and
entertain those guys in blue.

24:32.413 --> 24:34.999
Hey, man, forget it. I'm a
wrestler, not an entertainer.

24:35.082 --> 24:39.837
Yeah, but how much can the
average entertainer bench press?

24:43.757 --> 24:45.634
<i>Come on, Hulk, you can do it!</i>

24:45.718 --> 24:47.678
<i>Come on, you can do it, boy.</i>

24:50.931 --> 24:53.309
<i>Come on, Hulkster,
do it, lift it, man!</i>

24:53.392 --> 24:56.270
<i>Yeah, come on, come on!
Come on, Hulkster.</i>

24:56.520 --> 24:58.772
<i>Lift it, buddy. Hey.</i>

24:58.939 --> 25:01.567
<i>Come on, Hulkster,
go. Go. Go. Go!</i>

25:01.650 --> 25:03.652
<i>Do it, man, lift it.
All right!</i>

25:07.114 --> 25:08.574
I told you, he could do it.

25:08.991 --> 25:10.034
<i>Come on.</i>

25:10.960 --> 25:12.120
Whoa!

25:16.040 --> 25:17.750
Ticket's all paid, Hulkster.

25:17.875 --> 25:19.168
Let's hit the road.

25:19.418 --> 25:21.003
Okay.
Nice talking with you guys.

25:31.972 --> 25:33.140
Where's your friend?

25:35.351 --> 25:37.186
He must be running late.

25:37.770 --> 25:39.313
Yeah, but he better get here.

25:39.480 --> 25:40.606
Yeah.

25:44.443 --> 25:46.028
Well, what are you gonna do?

25:46.070 --> 25:48.155
Shoot us in front of
all these cops?

25:52.034 --> 25:53.660
I have a confession
to make. I lied.

25:53.744 --> 25:55.329
Nobody's coming to meet us here.

25:56.955 --> 25:59.666
Yeah, so, you see,
we're gonna just leave...

25:59.750 --> 26:03.212
and if you try to stop us,
we'll yell for the police.

26:03.295 --> 26:05.130
See you around, Styles.

26:20.604 --> 26:21.730
Come on!

26:52.886 --> 26:54.930
Raise them, gentlemen.

26:55.013 --> 26:56.223
Yeah.

27:17.119 --> 27:18.412
It's all here, Fats.

27:21.039 --> 27:22.458
Where are our friends?

27:23.542 --> 27:25.461
Oh, they escaped on their own.

27:26.003 --> 27:28.213
But thanks for our dough.

27:28.338 --> 27:31.300
Well, then they're gone.

27:31.508 --> 27:32.551
Yeah.

27:33.218 --> 27:36.555
You guys can be gone, too.
There's the door.

27:37.264 --> 27:38.765
Well, if they're gone...

27:39.183 --> 27:41.435
it doesn't matter
who we hurt, does it?

27:59.286 --> 28:01.038
Yeah. Well, now, let's see.

28:01.747 --> 28:04.458
Racketeering, assault
with a deadly weapon...

28:04.625 --> 28:06.251
illegal possession.
How am I doing?

28:06.293 --> 28:07.544
Just fine.

28:07.961 --> 28:09.963
Hulk, you stay
here till the cops come.

28:10.255 --> 28:12.591
Tell them you did it all.
They'll believe you.

28:12.758 --> 28:15.552
B.A., you and I gotta
get back to the hospital.

28:29.316 --> 28:30.400
B.A.!

28:43.413 --> 28:46.708
They've taken Harry
to Wilshire Memorial Hospital.

28:46.875 --> 28:50.379
Ah. Marcel,
Templeton Peck.

28:50.504 --> 28:54.299
Listen, there are a couple of lovely
ladies sitting at the bar. Twins.

28:54.383 --> 28:56.677
Would you ask one of them
to come to the phone, please?

28:56.802 --> 29:00.347
No, I don't like this suit as much
as the other one. How do I look?

29:00.430 --> 29:03.809
You look terrific, Murdock.
The girls are gonna love you.

29:03.934 --> 29:06.937
That is, if they're still
speaking to us. Vikki.

29:08.397 --> 29:11.733
Rikki. Yeah. Listen,
I have got to apologize.

29:11.858 --> 29:14.570
Well, we've had
a little problem and...

29:16.822 --> 29:18.282
Look, look.
Now, wait, wait, wait.

29:18.407 --> 29:20.367
Now, why don't you girls
go over to La Serre...

29:20.534 --> 29:23.954
order dinner, and we'll
be there in 20 minutes.

29:24.037 --> 29:25.080
Hmm?

29:25.330 --> 29:26.623
Yes, great--

29:28.584 --> 29:30.335
Someone wants to talk to you.

29:31.378 --> 29:34.339
Listen, you better
make that an hour.

29:44.057 --> 29:47.936
This Harry Sullivan
sure is a popular fellow.

29:48.770 --> 29:51.773
I'm through messing around.
I wanna know where he is.

29:51.857 --> 29:54.776
Look, we've been at
this for over an hour now.

29:54.860 --> 29:58.405
Would you mind telling us why you're
so determined to kill this guy?

29:58.488 --> 29:59.823
He killed my brother.

30:00.532 --> 30:02.951
Twenty-five years I've been
looking for that louse.

30:03.535 --> 30:06.413
Twenty-five years I've
offered a standing reward.

30:07.623 --> 30:09.249
Now, I'm the big wise guy.

30:09.541 --> 30:10.292
Yeah.

30:10.375 --> 30:12.127
And he's the drunken bum.

30:13.754 --> 30:17.090
And now, we both wind up in LA.

30:26.683 --> 30:29.144
You never should've
answered that telephone.

30:41.740 --> 30:43.075
You okay, Dad?

30:44.117 --> 30:46.870
Yeah. Yeah.

30:50.290 --> 30:51.917
Come on,
we're getting out of here.

30:52.793 --> 30:54.378
- You ain't going nowhere.
- Hey!

30:54.461 --> 30:56.088
You're gonna get well, man.

30:57.964 --> 30:58.840
What are you guys?

30:58.924 --> 31:01.009
What are you, a legion of
do-gooders or something?

31:01.093 --> 31:03.220
Why don't you just
get out of my life?

31:03.303 --> 31:05.681
Hey, man, you listen up
and you listen good.

31:05.806 --> 31:08.392
We ain't doing it for you.
We're doing it for your son.

31:08.475 --> 31:10.477
And he's in a lot of trouble
because of you.

31:12.396 --> 31:13.730
You see this man here?

31:13.814 --> 31:16.525
This is Hulk Hogan, the heavyweight
wrestling champion of the world.

31:16.608 --> 31:18.694
And he's been running all over
town trying to help you...

31:18.777 --> 31:20.946
an ungrateful,
broken-down bum...

31:21.029 --> 31:23.198
who got his kid on the street
running numbers.

31:23.323 --> 31:26.576
A bum, don't even have the
decency and common sense...

31:26.660 --> 31:28.954
to keep his own kid
out of the rackets.

31:29.788 --> 31:31.623
Come on, Hulkster,
let's get out of here.

31:31.707 --> 31:33.208
I'm tired of
looking at this creep.

31:35.168 --> 31:36.378
How is he?

31:37.671 --> 31:39.381
Fine, for a bum.

31:40.632 --> 31:44.052
You may get a second chance, Harry.
Fats is in jail.

31:50.559 --> 31:51.435
<i>Hello?</i>

31:51.518 --> 31:53.812
Hello, Hannibal?

31:54.146 --> 31:55.772
They got us.

31:55.939 --> 31:57.232
I thought you escaped.

31:57.315 --> 31:59.776
Well, we did.
It wasn't those guys.

31:59.860 --> 32:03.029
These are different guys.
These are...

32:03.530 --> 32:05.824
much nicer guys.

32:10.495 --> 32:12.330
This is Richie Ifker.

32:13.373 --> 32:16.251
I want Harry,
or your friends are dead.

32:16.418 --> 32:18.170
We might be willing
to make a trade.

32:18.253 --> 32:19.504
You better be.

32:19.671 --> 32:22.549
Bring my friends to the Wilshire
Memorial Hospital in an hour.

32:22.674 --> 32:24.009
It would be my pleasure.

32:28.305 --> 32:29.639
All right, Harry.

32:29.848 --> 32:33.685
Who's Richie Ifker and why's he so
anxious to put you six feet under?

32:33.769 --> 32:36.146
He's a big-time mob guy.

32:37.731 --> 32:42.110
I killed his brother 25 years ago.
We were kids.

32:42.194 --> 32:43.653
You killed a guy?

32:43.945 --> 32:45.405
Yeah, I killed a guy.

32:47.032 --> 32:50.076
I was a boxer back then.
I was a good one, too.

32:50.744 --> 32:53.455
And these punks wanted me
to throw a fight.

32:53.580 --> 32:55.415
Harry "The Hammer" Sullivan.

32:55.749 --> 32:57.042
Yeah, I remember you.

32:57.125 --> 32:59.920
You was a light heavyweight fighter
in Chicago when I was a kid.

33:00.003 --> 33:01.713
Harry the Hammer.

33:02.631 --> 33:04.090
Yeah, that was me.

33:04.299 --> 33:07.594
Yeah, you disappeared before a
big fight and never turned up.

33:07.677 --> 33:09.304
It was in all the papers.

33:10.055 --> 33:14.976
I wouldn't do it.
I wouldn't take a dive.

33:15.227 --> 33:17.521
And I've been
paying for that ever since.

33:17.604 --> 33:19.815
Moving from place to place...

33:21.024 --> 33:23.360
always looking over my shoulder.

33:24.110 --> 33:25.779
That's why you were
hiding out in the theater?

33:25.862 --> 33:27.030
Yeah.

33:27.155 --> 33:29.491
We finally got settled
here in LA...

33:30.742 --> 33:32.702
and everything was pretty good.

33:34.246 --> 33:35.497
Then...

33:36.248 --> 33:38.500
I lost a couple
of straight jobs...

33:40.085 --> 33:42.295
I got strapped and started...

33:43.046 --> 33:45.382
running numbers for Fats...

33:45.549 --> 33:48.009
just to keep food on the table.

33:48.176 --> 33:50.136
And then,
a couple of days ago...

33:50.220 --> 33:52.639
somebody gave me up.
I had to get off the street.

33:52.722 --> 33:54.599
Hey, you gave you up.

33:55.684 --> 34:00.647
He was drunk in some bar, talking about
the guy that he killed 20 years ago.

34:00.897 --> 34:04.526
Hey, any man that would take a
dive isn't a man in my book.

34:04.609 --> 34:07.320
Yeah, that was
my big moment of glory.

34:09.406 --> 34:13.118
I've been living off
of that glory for 25 years.

34:13.784 --> 34:15.495
The damnedest thing is...

34:17.539 --> 34:20.833
it was an accident.
It was just an accident.

34:29.717 --> 34:31.303
Pick up the guys
and get to the warehouse.

34:31.386 --> 34:32.971
Get the stuff
and start moving it.

34:33.096 --> 34:34.681
You don't mind talking
in front of these guys?

34:34.764 --> 34:35.724
These guys are dead.

34:35.806 --> 34:38.268
Oh, we definitely never should
have answered that phone.

34:38.518 --> 34:39.603
I'm going to the hospital.

34:39.728 --> 34:41.478
I'm gonna blow Harry the
Hammer, away myself.

34:41.563 --> 34:42.355
Got it.

34:42.438 --> 34:44.315
- Nothing like the personal touch.
- Come on.

34:54.284 --> 34:57.203
Hi. I'm here to visit
Harry Sullivan.

34:57.329 --> 34:59.664
Could you please tell me
what room he's in?

35:05.962 --> 35:07.255
Hello, Richie.

35:42.791 --> 35:44.250
They'll never catch him.

35:47.629 --> 35:49.631
Leave me alone.
Please, please.

36:28.461 --> 36:30.547
Here's the guy you've been
looking for for 20 years.

36:30.630 --> 36:33.466
Say goodbye, 'cause you won't be
seeing him for the next 20 years.

36:33.591 --> 36:35.051
No more running, Harry.

36:36.970 --> 36:38.263
We're all through.

36:38.430 --> 36:40.807
Not quite, Hannibal.

36:40.890 --> 36:43.852
Mr. Slick here has got something
coming in at San Pedro wharf.

36:43.935 --> 36:45.061
Oh, yeah?

36:47.647 --> 36:49.524
What you got coming in, Richie?

36:51.484 --> 36:55.655
Okay. B.A., you and Hulk
and I'll run these guys in.

36:55.947 --> 36:58.867
Murdock, you and Face...
Where's Face?

36:59.034 --> 37:01.578
We will absolutely be there.

37:02.328 --> 37:04.456
Darling, you have my word.

37:05.331 --> 37:10.045
Oh, great. Yeah. All right,
see you then. Bye-bye.

37:13.757 --> 37:15.133
Are you sure you
told them the truth?

37:15.258 --> 37:18.094
Oh, no, they'd never believe that.
I had to make something up.

37:18.303 --> 37:19.888
Don't worry, they're gonna
meet us for lunch...

37:19.971 --> 37:22.133
in one hour at La Palm.
- That's amazing.

37:22.158 --> 37:23.274
- Yeah.
- Come on.

37:23.683 --> 37:25.101
 Somebody
wants to see you.

37:25.185 --> 37:26.102
Yeah.

37:26.186 --> 37:27.771
I know that voice.

37:27.896 --> 37:29.647
I want my $10,000.

37:29.731 --> 37:30.899
I thought you were in jail.

37:30.982 --> 37:34.694
Made bail in 14 minutes.
New personal record.

37:35.862 --> 37:36.988
Nice.

37:44.287 --> 37:46.189
Hey!

37:47.749 --> 37:49.000
Hey, put me down.

37:49.125 --> 37:50.835
Well, Harry Sullivan.

37:51.544 --> 37:52.587
Hey, come on!

37:52.670 --> 37:55.381
Man. You don't write...

37:55.924 --> 37:59.052
you don't call,
not even a postcard.

37:59.219 --> 38:00.762
- <i>Leave me alone!</i>
- Why don't you just hit the road?

38:00.845 --> 38:02.347
I want my $10,000?

38:02.430 --> 38:05.683
I don't have it.
I haven't seen it for days.

38:05.767 --> 38:07.769
Oh, yeah?
Then where's the wise guy...

38:07.852 --> 38:09.646
with the gray head
and two wrestlers?

38:09.813 --> 38:11.356
I don't know what you're
talking about, man.

38:11.481 --> 38:12.607
<i>Let go!</i>

38:13.525 --> 38:15.193
Well, we'll see about that.

38:15.652 --> 38:18.571
<i>Hey, put me down.
Hey, come on.</i>

38:21.908 --> 38:25.578
What do you say we see how high your kid
can bounce off the pavement, huh, Harry?

38:25.662 --> 38:27.330
Hey, don't tell them, Dad.

38:29.374 --> 38:31.584
All right, last chance, Harry.
Where are those guys?

38:31.709 --> 38:33.837
Hey, don't tell them.
Don't tell them nothing.

38:34.754 --> 38:36.840
Okay, okay. I'll tell you.

38:36.923 --> 38:37.882
No!

38:37.966 --> 38:39.926
They're at a warehouse
in San Pedro.

38:40.009 --> 38:41.261
You gotta be
telling me the truth.

38:41.344 --> 38:43.930
That's the truth.
Now, that is the truth.

38:44.013 --> 38:46.391
Please, just lay off the kid,
will you, please, Fats?

38:46.474 --> 38:48.643
Yeah, we'll lay off the kid...

38:48.726 --> 38:50.395
right after
we get our money back.

38:50.603 --> 38:52.981
But in the meantime, he's
coming along for a ride.

38:53.022 --> 38:54.274
No, no.

38:56.818 --> 38:59.612
Hey, you lost a little of
your footwork, huh, Harry?

39:01.406 --> 39:04.242
Tie them up and lock them in the
closet and let's get going.

39:20.884 --> 39:22.760
They're supposed
to meet us right here.

39:25.555 --> 39:27.807
This is about par for
the course, Hannibal.

39:28.099 --> 39:29.184
Come on, let's take a look.

39:29.209 --> 39:30.752
Where the heck are those guys?

39:40.653 --> 39:42.238
What's going on around here?

40:17.482 --> 40:18.650
Arms shipment.

40:18.691 --> 40:21.277
Cases of Uzi's, rocket
launchers, and ammo.

40:21.402 --> 40:23.238
That's what I like
about organized crime.

40:23.321 --> 40:24.614
They're always diversifying.

40:24.697 --> 40:26.366
What's the plan, Hannibal?

40:28.785 --> 40:31.371
Front door, I know you're
gonna say the front door.

40:31.412 --> 40:32.997
We always go
through the front door.

40:33.081 --> 40:35.708
I'm sick and tired of going
through the front door.

40:35.917 --> 40:38.211
You got a better idea,
B.A., I'm ready.

40:51.140 --> 40:54.102
We got you surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.

42:25.860 --> 42:27.320
Think you can throw it that far?

42:27.445 --> 42:29.072
Oh, piece of cake.

42:36.454 --> 42:38.331
Beautiful. Do it again.

42:38.414 --> 42:40.041
Oh, yes, two.

42:54.931 --> 42:56.140
One more.

44:28.566 --> 44:31.694
Well, not bad for a day
at the youth center, huh?

44:42.872 --> 44:46.000
I just don't know
about this, Face.

44:46.292 --> 44:49.545
Hey, we gotta make it look like
we were in a bad accident, okay?

44:49.795 --> 44:51.839
Sympathy always works
with women.

44:52.006 --> 44:55.218
Yeah, but before, you said it was designer
clothes that was gonna work with women.

44:55.301 --> 44:57.970
Will you trust me on this, okay?
I know these girls.

44:58.471 --> 45:00.806
We have a can't-miss
proposition here.

45:09.941 --> 45:11.859
Vikki, Rikki, we made it!

45:11.943 --> 45:13.402
A little late, aren't we?

45:13.486 --> 45:15.863
Oh, I know, I know. We're
a day and a half late...

45:15.947 --> 45:17.657
but you wouldn't believe
what happened to us.

45:17.782 --> 45:20.326
Oh, I'm sorry,
this is my good friend H.M.--

45:20.409 --> 45:22.578
That's our friends,
Larry and Jack.

45:23.204 --> 45:26.749
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Look, we
were in a terrible accident, and...

45:26.832 --> 45:29.001
Well, we hope you recuperate.

45:34.924 --> 45:36.842
- Sympathy, huh?
- Well...

45:36.926 --> 45:38.135
Designer clothes, huh?

45:38.219 --> 45:39.553
I tell you!

45:40.596 --> 45:42.098
I really wanna thank you guys.

45:42.223 --> 45:44.100
Don't thank us.
Thank Jeffrey.

45:44.183 --> 45:45.309
He's a good kid.

45:46.435 --> 45:50.898
You know, life's a lot like
a boxing match, I guess.

45:51.357 --> 45:53.401
You keep getting
pounded and pounded...

45:53.526 --> 45:55.444
and everybody thinks you're
going down for the count.

45:55.611 --> 45:58.239
You can still win in the late
rounds, you know, if you come back.

45:58.364 --> 45:59.240
Ain't that right, Hulk?

45:59.323 --> 46:01.242
Couldn't have said it
better myself, Harry.

46:02.576 --> 46:03.577
Hey.

46:03.786 --> 46:04.632
Hey.

46:04.992 --> 46:05.936
Is it safe?

46:05.961 --> 46:07.707
Oh, man, all right.

46:08.874 --> 46:12.003
Man, you guys did more damage around
here than me and Dent put together.

46:12.044 --> 46:13.296
How you doing, man?

46:13.379 --> 46:15.423
Hey, the Hulkster's telling
me that you're from Chicago.

46:15.464 --> 46:17.633
Yeah, a long time ago.

46:17.800 --> 46:19.969
I have something for you.
Really?

46:20.052 --> 46:21.262
Thanks a lot, man.

46:21.846 --> 46:24.056
Hey, Fridge.
Where's our hats, man?

46:24.181 --> 46:26.309
Yeah, man.
What about our hats?

46:26.559 --> 46:27.685
Back off.

46:27.852 --> 46:30.521
Hey, man, we supposed to get a hat, man.
Ain't that right, Hulkman?

46:30.604 --> 46:31.814
You gave everybody else
a hat, man.

46:31.897 --> 46:33.399
Why didn't he give us
no hat for?
