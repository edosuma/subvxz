03:15.209 --> 03:18.708
Is the...

03:19.625 --> 03:21.458
chambermaid.

03:25.875 --> 03:26.666
Deal.

03:32.417 --> 03:36.499
A, B, C, D, E, F, G,

03:40.292 --> 03:46.958
H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O...

03:47.667 --> 03:48.749
Eyes open.

04:01.959 --> 04:05.208
Just throw it over a chair, Maria.
Undress me.

04:44.709 --> 04:46.124
Lily of the Valley.

04:55.959 --> 04:57.749
Thank you Maria.
You may go.

06:13.292 --> 06:15.624
What are you doing in my bedroom?
You...

06:16.375 --> 06:17.541
Pim...

06:20.250 --> 06:23.999
Come downstairs, boy.
Mama is not angry.

07:01.459 --> 07:04.624
Kids, have a look at what I found.
A boy.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.124
Hey, settle down.

07:19.917 --> 07:22.999
Get Pim a glass of water,
you big lout.

07:25.084 --> 07:26.958
Here you are, sir.

07:37.084 --> 07:38.916
What a lovely stench.

07:39.917 --> 07:44.041
- You smell lovely.
- It's uh... Yvette's perfume.

08:07.834 --> 08:12.833
- You should head off home now.
- But the puzzle's not finished yet.

08:13.042 --> 08:17.083
Your mother isn't easily worried
but still, I don't want her to...

08:17.292 --> 08:19.416
It's just the motorbike.

08:19.959 --> 08:22.999
Let's go, Pim.

08:26.542 --> 08:27.791
Bye, Pim.

08:32.375 --> 08:33.332
Here.

08:54.417 --> 08:55.499
Hey, Mirza.

10:01.834 --> 10:03.999
Thanks.

10:04.209 --> 10:07.291
Wait.

10:08.625 --> 10:10.374
Here. Yummy, right?

10:12.875 --> 10:15.249
Let's do it again.

11:31.084 --> 11:35.124
My left hand is the chambermaid

13:14.834 --> 13:17.041
Just wait till I'm eighteen.

13:17.250 --> 13:21.041
Then that'll be a shiny
motorbike instead of a bicycle.

13:22.250 --> 13:23.374
Eighteen.

13:32.875 --> 13:37.833
Look, this is the one.
Suzuki 380 GT.

13:38.042 --> 13:41.708
- And you can sit on the back.
- Me?

13:53.250 --> 13:54.041
It's hot in here.

14:00.750 --> 14:02.083
Imagine, 380 CC, Pim.

14:14.542 --> 14:16.208
First you need to turn fifteen.

14:16.417 --> 14:20.624
Then you can have my bike.
For your birthday.

14:20.834 --> 14:22.416
Thank you, Gino.

14:23.292 --> 14:24.083
Wow.

15:32.834 --> 15:36.999
Pimmie. Dirty scoundrel.

15:38.417 --> 15:39.541
The doorbell.

15:40.667 --> 15:41.958
It's ringing.

15:54.959 --> 15:59.041
Here. From me.
A boy should own a knife.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.083
Etienne.

16:01.625 --> 16:03.791
Wasn't it your birthday yesterday?

16:04.000 --> 16:05.916
Tomorrow.
Fifteen.

16:09.209 --> 16:12.124
- Is that you, Etienne?
- Yvette.

16:13.250 --> 16:17.333
Here. From me.
A boy should own a knife.

16:17.542 --> 16:18.916
And what do you say?

16:20.000 --> 16:22.999
'Thank you, Etienne.'

16:29.125 --> 16:29.999
Good dog.

17:38.334 --> 17:41.374
- Open a can of sardines for yourself.
- Sure.

17:41.584 --> 17:43.583
Yes, please.

17:55.084 --> 17:56.833
Be good. Lock the doors.

17:58.667 --> 18:00.374
You're a big boy.

18:00.584 --> 18:03.291
We'll be back tomorrow.

18:21.292 --> 18:22.458
And are you happy?

18:24.834 --> 18:25.999
With the knife?

18:26.625 --> 18:27.999
Thank you very much, Etienne.

19:54.959 --> 19:55.833
It's me.

19:57.084 --> 19:58.249
Hello, 'Me'.

20:01.625 --> 20:03.624
Would you like
a glass of lemonade, Pim?

20:05.417 --> 20:06.583
The latest news.

20:06.917 --> 20:08.583
The latest news from the
day before yesterday.

20:12.292 --> 20:14.999
Your boss has taken my mother
all the way to Lille,

20:15.209 --> 20:17.958
Festival de l'Accordéon.
They're staying in a hotel.

20:19.875 --> 20:21.499
When you put
the cat with the milk...

20:22.625 --> 20:26.124
My mother doesn't want that fatty.
She only wants his car.

20:26.834 --> 20:28.208
See nothing, say nothing, Pim.

20:30.125 --> 20:33.583
That's why we live
such a rich life.

20:40.667 --> 20:41.666
Mum, can Pim sleep here?

20:44.584 --> 20:46.541
Can he, please?

20:47.250 --> 20:50.916
Okay. You can't sleep in an
empty house all by yourself.

20:52.959 --> 20:54.916
You can share my bed.

20:55.125 --> 21:00.708
It's summer. Pim and I are sleeping
outside in the dunes, in the tent.

21:31.584 --> 21:33.833
I got this from mother.

21:38.834 --> 21:40.916
From my boss.

21:42.584 --> 21:43.416
Nice.

21:48.209 --> 21:50.916
Now we've both got
the same knife.

22:00.334 --> 22:02.416
It's my birthday tomorrow.

22:05.125 --> 22:06.708
That's why.

23:27.084 --> 23:33.333
No-one has to know about this,
Pimmie. It's between us.

25:29.875 --> 25:31.916
- For he's a jolly good fellow...
- And so say all of us...

25:32.125 --> 25:35.124
- for he's a jolly good fellow
- And so say all of us

25:37.292 --> 25:40.583
For your birthday.

25:43.625 --> 25:49.208
Pencils. Thank you Sabrina.
I needed a 4B.

25:51.667 --> 25:53.624
- Coffee?
- Yes, please.

26:03.209 --> 26:05.083
Pim?

26:05.292 --> 26:08.541
- Yes, sorry.
- Dreamer.

26:12.834 --> 26:16.708
Did you sleep well in the tent?

26:18.709 --> 26:20.958
We should do it more often.

26:34.417 --> 26:39.624
- Mum? Will she have made chips?
- Of course, she always does.

26:43.959 --> 26:47.333
Can Pim come to Aunty Ginette's?

26:47.959 --> 26:50.583
I don't think so.

27:38.917 --> 27:42.958
There we go. A whole different
kind of audience, the French.

27:43.167 --> 27:45.583
I need a lie down.

27:50.375 --> 27:53.124
I suppose you don't want
a kiss from me either?

27:55.542 --> 27:58.916
You making fries?
Shall I ...

28:15.459 --> 28:20.124
When I know the moves
well enough, I'll show you.

28:21.500 --> 28:23.541
- Pim?
- Yeah?

28:24.792 --> 28:26.916
Dreamer...

28:27.917 --> 28:31.541
I'm using a glue stick now.
It's much tidier than paste.

28:39.250 --> 28:40.749
The bike.

29:41.792 --> 29:45.208
- Beauty and the Beast.
- Watch your words, man.

29:49.750 --> 29:51.708
What are you thinking of?

29:53.000 --> 29:55.791
You forgot to bring your tent.

30:13.667 --> 30:15.791
- See you.
- Wait.

30:21.125 --> 30:23.208
Here.
Happy birthday.

30:24.417 --> 30:25.333
Thanks.

31:49.042 --> 31:52.208
- It's me.
- Hello, 'Me'.

31:53.125 --> 31:54.083
Would you like some lemonade?

31:54.292 --> 31:56.666
- We're going for a ride.
- Not on the main road.

31:56.875 --> 31:59.333
No, mother.

32:12.792 --> 32:15.374
- Come on.
- Already?

32:15.917 --> 32:18.958
- I need to go.
- Where to?

32:19.959 --> 32:21.458
De Panne.

32:22.167 --> 32:25.041
- Can I come too?
- No.

32:26.334 --> 32:29.499
- Why not?
- Because.

32:30.459 --> 32:32.291
I thought we did
everything together.

32:32.500 --> 32:35.374
- Next time we'll go together.
- Promise?

32:35.584 --> 32:37.874
Of course. Come on.

32:51.250 --> 32:53.416
Don't tell anyone, okay?

33:13.250 --> 33:16.749
- Back already?
- Yeah...

33:17.334 --> 33:18.958
Gino had trouble with his bike.

33:19.709 --> 33:23.374
- Etienne, could you...
- Of course, what's the problem?

33:23.584 --> 33:27.458
It's the... carburettor.

33:28.000 --> 33:32.624
We've only just changed it.
I'm going to have a look.

33:33.959 --> 33:36.166
- Is Gino home?
- Yes... no.

33:37.042 --> 33:38.958
It's not necessary, don't bother.

33:39.167 --> 33:42.083
- It's no problem.
- It's not necessary.

33:43.750 --> 33:46.124
- Gino can do it himself.
- Pim?

33:46.334 --> 33:50.708
What've you got against Etienne?
You little ingrate.

33:53.834 --> 33:56.041
Okay...

33:56.250 --> 33:59.916
I'll come get you on Saturday
for the Accordionade. Yvette.

34:59.667 --> 35:02.083
I'll come to the Texas later.

35:03.625 --> 35:07.458
By eleven o'clock,
we'll be back by then.

35:09.792 --> 35:11.158
Bye bye.

35:30.040 --> 35:31.280
Bye bye.

36:29.000 --> 36:34.749
A, B, C, D...

36:52.834 --> 36:56.416
E, F, G...

36:57.667 --> 36:59.083
Gino.

38:29.667 --> 38:31.666
It's me.

38:33.084 --> 38:34.999
Hey boy.

38:35.417 --> 38:38.208
Button came off my dress.

38:40.292 --> 38:43.208
Gino's gone to Dunkirk.

38:45.417 --> 38:48.833
Why can't he find a girl
who doesn't live so far away?

38:49.667 --> 38:54.666
She wanted to go dancing,
that girl. In De Panne.

38:55.084 --> 38:57.208
Her name is Françoise.

38:58.334 --> 39:00.791
Would you like a glass
of orange lemonade Pim?

39:01.000 --> 39:03.124
Gino and dancing.

39:05.209 --> 39:06.166
Little children grow up.

39:06.375 --> 39:11.791
Or should I open the other one?
I think the orange one's gone flat.

39:13.542 --> 39:17.499
He might bring her home soon,
Françoise.

39:17.792 --> 39:22.291
Françoise.
She has white sandals.

39:24.875 --> 39:26.291
- The motorbike.
- Oui, oui.

39:26.500 --> 39:29.583
- Don't be such a baby.
- Non, non, non, non.

39:30.584 --> 39:34.583
Even second-hand, a bike
like that costs a small fortune.

39:34.792 --> 39:39.666
And a boy on an apprenticeship
doesn't have a lot to his name.

39:39.875 --> 39:45.958
Mother will work for it.
Ah, but it's always been his dream.

39:47.167 --> 39:51.083
There are only so many things
you can save up for. Sugar sachets.

39:51.292 --> 39:52.916
Mother...

39:54.209 --> 39:57.166
I'll only tell this to you, Pim.

39:57.375 --> 39:59.708
Sugar sachets.

40:00.459 --> 40:03.416
I take them from the empty
trays in the cafeteria.

40:03.625 --> 40:05.541
The doctor says I shouldn't
have sugar but still...

40:05.750 --> 40:07.583
Mum...

40:07.792 --> 40:10.666
They throw them away,
the sachets.

40:10.875 --> 40:13.208
Even when they're unopened.

40:13.834 --> 40:16.708
Pim would like a sandwich.
Right?

40:16.917 --> 40:20.499
And yesterday, for the
first time, Gino went...

40:23.334 --> 40:29.249
to work in the wayside restaurant.
Friday evenings and Sundays.

40:29.667 --> 40:31.083
The money's not bad.

40:31.292 --> 40:33.499
And he's doing well in the
garage, according to Etienne.

40:33.709 --> 40:35.499
He learns fast, our Gino.

40:35.709 --> 40:40.833
If the bike needs fixing,
he can do it himself.

40:44.000 --> 40:46.874
He's good with his hands.

40:50.167 --> 40:52.499
Gino's going to be late.

40:53.334 --> 40:54.708
But what do you expect?

40:54.917 --> 40:58.333
He's eighteen.
And that girl wants to dance.

40:59.625 --> 41:01.416
The paper boy is turning in.

41:01.959 --> 41:04.958
And I'm off to bed early.
I'm so tired these days.

41:05.167 --> 41:07.083
You sure you don't want a drink?

41:07.292 --> 41:10.791
- You're going to the Texas.
- Yep.

41:57.292 --> 41:59.999
When the cat's away...

42:00.209 --> 42:02.333
Your mother's not here yet.

42:04.584 --> 42:07.166
Did you go around with the paper?

42:07.667 --> 42:09.541
Was Marcella crazy as usual?

42:09.750 --> 42:11.166
Where's your mother
playing tonight?

42:11.375 --> 42:12.666
Far away, for sure?

42:12.875 --> 42:14.041
De Panne.

42:14.250 --> 42:17.624
From now on you can bring
yesterday's paper to me.

42:17.834 --> 42:19.833
Such a good boy.

42:20.042 --> 42:24.708
- What would you like to drink, son?
- So, no girlfriend yet?

42:25.417 --> 42:27.083
Grenadine.

42:27.292 --> 42:31.791
She's called Grenadine? Definitely
one from across the border then.

42:33.334 --> 42:36.249
No, no, he doesn't know yet,
isn't it, boy?

42:36.459 --> 42:38.374
So, don't you check
out the girls?

42:38.584 --> 42:44.249
It's alright, tell us which one
of us you prefer. Go on.

42:57.000 --> 43:01.541
Here, you can read Libelle magazine.
Or draw a picture, quiet one.

43:32.584 --> 43:36.333
- Tadaaa!
- The later it gets...

43:37.375 --> 43:40.708
- Mark my words.
- Everything alright, boy?

43:44.500 --> 43:46.416
- He'll soon draw you.
- Yeah, right.

43:46.625 --> 43:51.624
- So Pim, who haven't you drawn yet?
- Me. He hasn't drawn me yet.

43:51.834 --> 43:54.833
It's too difficult.
You're far too beautiful.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.833
- Lots of people in De Panne?
- Ooh la la.

43:59.042 --> 44:01.666
Coucou. Oh... Don't.

44:17.750 --> 44:22.166
Here, a beer for a big boy.

44:22.917 --> 44:27.541
Your mother doesn't mind.
The... She...

44:29.209 --> 44:30.958
Never mind.

44:34.459 --> 44:36.416
Gino.

45:59.042 --> 46:02.041
- Next time, baby...
- I'm taking you home.

46:02.250 --> 46:04.583
Hurry up.

46:17.125 --> 46:18.708
I'm telling mother.

46:31.709 --> 46:33.499
You shut your mouth.

48:42.959 --> 48:48.083
It's no good like this. I need
a partner to dance. Come on.

48:48.709 --> 48:50.999
Much too shy.

48:51.875 --> 48:54.416
Okay, wait a second.

49:25.334 --> 49:27.583
What is it?

49:28.667 --> 49:29.874
I'm no dancer.

49:33.917 --> 49:35.833
Do you think I'm pretty?

49:36.209 --> 49:38.208
Yeah.

49:39.709 --> 49:42.124
Then kiss me.

49:42.625 --> 49:45.166
Sabrina, I...

49:50.292 --> 49:52.208
Strange boy.

49:55.959 --> 49:57.874
Thank you, Pim.

50:01.292 --> 50:05.874
Say, what's that French
girl's name again?

50:06.084 --> 50:07.958
Gino's girlfriend.

50:10.125 --> 50:12.541
I don't know.

50:12.750 --> 50:16.083
Maybe he'll bring her along
to the fun fair when it's back.

50:16.292 --> 50:19.041
Etienne says she's pretty.

50:22.375 --> 50:27.249
Say boy, you going
to draw all night?

50:28.125 --> 50:31.708
Normal boys your age hang
out with their friends.

50:31.917 --> 50:36.041
Or girlfriends. Ooh la la.

50:37.125 --> 50:41.291
Normal women your age don't
spend their nights out.

50:58.875 --> 51:01.333
Room to let

51:08.750 --> 51:10.333
Sabrina.

51:16.875 --> 51:23.416
Water's included in the price
electricity and heating too...

51:23.625 --> 51:25.541
The doorbell.

51:25.750 --> 51:27.583
Someone just rang it.

51:27.792 --> 51:30.124
- I didn't...
- I'm sure I heard it.

51:30.334 --> 51:32.833
One moment.

52:24.209 --> 52:26.083
No-one there.

52:26.542 --> 52:30.458
- Here, why don't you take one?
- I don't smoke.

52:31.500 --> 52:33.458
Smart girl.

52:34.625 --> 52:35.999
Did you ever hear
back from the gypsy

52:36.209 --> 52:37.541
who used to rent this room?

52:37.750 --> 52:41.249
Zoltan?
No.

52:41.459 --> 52:45.208
One day he just left.
Like a bird, flown away...

52:45.792 --> 52:47.541
Gone with the funfair.

52:50.375 --> 52:53.749
That's the life, girl.

52:53.959 --> 52:56.958
North in summer, south in winter.

52:58.167 --> 53:04.374
Venice, Paris, Piraeus,
Lima, Capri...

53:05.875 --> 53:08.291
Strange places, strange people.

53:08.500 --> 53:11.999
Do what you want.
No cares...

53:15.459 --> 53:17.041
No children...

53:20.667 --> 53:22.999
The room is pretty nice.

53:31.459 --> 53:35.374
- Where's Pim, by the way?
- Out. He didn't say where.

53:38.125 --> 53:40.333
Is he quiet at home too?

53:41.334 --> 53:44.708
- You think he's quiet?
- Yes.

53:45.084 --> 53:47.999
Don't think I hear
his voice often.

53:49.209 --> 53:52.041
That boy lives in
a world of his own.

53:54.375 --> 53:57.666
My guess is as good as yours
on what goes on in his mind.

54:00.042 --> 54:06.749
Drawing... he loves to draw.
But I never see them, his drawings.

54:09.459 --> 54:12.458
I worry sometimes, Sabrina,
you know?

54:14.084 --> 54:16.041
I only have one son.

54:17.709 --> 54:20.041
Pim's a dreamer.

54:23.500 --> 54:25.874
You can tell...
What's her name?

54:26.084 --> 54:29.749
Françoise.
But it's not certain whether...

54:30.834 --> 54:32.041
Well, yes...

54:33.125 --> 54:35.958
You can tell her it
seemed okay to you.

54:36.417 --> 54:41.124
Why didn't she come to take
a look herself? Too shy?

54:45.000 --> 54:47.374
So what kind of a
job is she after?

54:47.584 --> 54:51.499
There's as little work here
as in Northern France right?

54:51.709 --> 54:57.333
Oh yeah, no visitors in the room.
Tell your brother that.

54:57.959 --> 54:59.874
Does she speak Dutch?

55:03.125 --> 55:06.333
Right, you don't even
know that much.

55:57.334 --> 55:59.916
The doctors say I need to rest.

56:00.625 --> 56:02.833
Get Pim a drink, would you?

56:18.459 --> 56:22.333
Good that I still have my daughter,
now Gino's flown the nest.

56:23.334 --> 56:25.999
The house seems so much bigger.

56:27.000 --> 56:28.416
He lives with her now.

56:28.792 --> 56:31.666
They're both working
in a restaurant in Dunkirk.

56:32.250 --> 56:34.833
Washing up? Cleaning floors?
I have no idea.

56:35.417 --> 56:40.208
- He didn't even come to the hospital.
- Gino doesn't like hospitals.

56:52.125 --> 56:55.374
I'd better get going.

57:55.625 --> 57:57.624
Pim...

57:58.250 --> 58:03.166
It's Etienne. What does
that fat prick think?

58:06.584 --> 58:10.583
At the hotel in Lille,
something happened.

58:10.792 --> 58:13.208
I was caught up in the moment.

58:13.917 --> 58:16.749
But I wanted it to be a one-off.

58:19.459 --> 58:22.208
But on the way home from Dunkirk

58:22.417 --> 58:26.333
he pulled into a rest
stop off the highway.

58:27.084 --> 58:30.208
He couldn't keep his
hands off me.

58:33.125 --> 58:35.291
I bit him.

58:41.500 --> 58:44.999
Come inside, mum.
You'll catch a cold.

58:46.792 --> 58:48.708
Yes.

59:07.709 --> 59:09.499
Mirza... Mirza.

59:09.709 --> 59:11.124
Whoa there.

59:28.959 --> 59:30.833
Zoltan...

59:33.125 --> 59:34.083
there you are.

59:34.292 --> 59:39.416
Good evening, Yvette,
I'm back again...

59:40.584 --> 59:43.416
Pim will show you the room.

59:57.167 --> 01:00:00.166
You can hang your clothes
here, on the hooks.

01:00:12.792 --> 01:00:14.749
You have grown.

01:00:14.959 --> 01:00:18.333
No wonder.
I'm already sixteen.

01:00:30.542 --> 01:00:35.583
- Did you get Zoltan a clean towel?
- A towel. I think so, yes.

01:00:37.709 --> 01:00:39.958
We could use the money.

01:00:40.875 --> 01:00:43.791
And he's rented the room before...

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:47.624
Zoltan was just a boy back then.
Now he's a man.

01:00:49.625 --> 01:00:53.166
That stupid sign in the
window can finally go.

01:00:53.792 --> 01:00:57.333
The room has been
rented out, Françoise.

01:01:18.667 --> 01:01:21.291
You still only drink red wine?

01:01:35.417 --> 01:01:38.499
- Zoltan.
- Pim.

01:01:39.125 --> 01:01:41.208
Little Pim.

01:01:42.292 --> 01:01:44.291
I remember.

01:01:45.417 --> 01:01:47.291
Little Pim.

01:02:14.625 --> 01:02:19.874
Shall I play the gentlemen
a tune? A waltz.

01:03:18.542 --> 01:03:20.666
Mirza?

01:03:32.625 --> 01:03:34.583
Where were you all night?

01:03:34.792 --> 01:03:39.416
Hi, my friend.
You little rascal, you.

01:03:40.917 --> 01:03:45.499
You two can have a sandwich.
There's still some jam left.

01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:46.708
I'll put it away.

01:04:51.834 --> 01:04:54.874
Friday, party night.

01:05:05.459 --> 01:05:07.208
Shush.

01:05:08.917 --> 01:05:11.124
He'll be back.

01:05:59.875 --> 01:06:03.749
Pim, is your mother
working today?

01:06:06.125 --> 01:06:06.999
She's working.

01:06:07.209 --> 01:06:09.749
What would you like to drink,
grenadine?

01:06:09.959 --> 01:06:11.416
Probably Romanian.

01:06:11.625 --> 01:06:13.999
No, Bulgarian.
He's a fortune-hunter.

01:06:14.209 --> 01:06:15.958
Grenadine.

01:06:16.375 --> 01:06:20.333
And why isn't the carnie sleeping
in the caravan next to the dodgems?

01:06:20.542 --> 01:06:21.374
Come on.

01:06:21.584 --> 01:06:26.583
Pim doesn't know about all that,
do you boy? Here, on the house.

01:06:26.792 --> 01:06:30.208
And when the fair leaves,
is he going to stay behind?

01:06:30.875 --> 01:06:33.916
Better a fat car
than a fat man, Julien.

01:06:34.125 --> 01:06:38.791
Life is too short.
And now you shut your bald face.

01:06:57.875 --> 01:06:59.833
Tonight, spaghetti.

01:07:00.042 --> 01:07:02.666
Then you know more than I do.

01:07:45.834 --> 01:07:48.833
Little Pim?
Towel, please.

01:07:49.209 --> 01:07:51.208
Okay.

01:07:54.250 --> 01:07:55.791
Here you go.

01:07:58.584 --> 01:08:00.541
Let's eat.

01:08:04.792 --> 01:08:06.791
And there's vanilla
custard for dessert.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:11.416
- Dessert?
- Yes, dessert.

01:08:27.459 --> 01:08:31.374
The Cologne fair,
that you've got to see.

01:08:31.584 --> 01:08:33.541
Little Pim, you wouldn't
believe your eyes.

01:08:33.750 --> 01:08:36.749
It's so big,
there are always jobs.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:43.541
Leave that till the morning, boy.
You're my audience.

01:09:10.209 --> 01:09:11.707
Yes?

01:09:14.417 --> 01:09:16.291
Gino...

01:09:18.667 --> 01:09:20.374
Yes...

01:09:21.750 --> 01:09:23.749
Okay, what is...

01:09:35.167 --> 01:09:37.082
Sabrina.

01:09:38.084 --> 01:09:40.707
Sabrina,
she's fallen hard for you.

01:09:41.334 --> 01:09:45.541
I can see it in everything
she does. She's smitten.

01:09:46.625 --> 01:09:49.749
But you already know that.

01:09:56.834 --> 01:09:59.749
You're going to be
seventeen soon, Pimmie.

01:10:00.084 --> 01:10:02.124
Seventeen.

01:10:05.209 --> 01:10:07.624
You have to...

01:10:08.375 --> 01:10:10.624
We both have to...

01:10:15.709 --> 01:10:18.791
Sometimes people have
to make choices.

01:10:20.917 --> 01:10:23.791
I'll tell you about Françoise...

01:10:32.459 --> 01:10:34.749
Come on, Pimmie.

01:10:38.667 --> 01:10:41.083
We can still be friends.

01:10:44.792 --> 01:10:48.374
We were kids. Boys.

01:10:49.084 --> 01:10:51.083
It was a game.

01:10:54.209 --> 01:10:58.291
You and Sabrina, think about it.
Wouldn't it be great?

01:10:59.417 --> 01:11:01.208
I won't be here for much longer.

01:11:01.417 --> 01:11:05.416
When the fair goes back to Cologne,
Zoltan is taking me with him.

01:11:05.625 --> 01:11:07.333
The gypsy?

01:11:09.792 --> 01:11:14.166
- You look good when you're jealous.
- Who's the jealous one here?

01:11:15.042 --> 01:11:18.166
You don't think I was
in love with you, surely?

01:11:25.375 --> 01:11:26.708
Pim...

01:11:50.709 --> 01:11:52.166
Quiet, boy.

01:12:54.084 --> 01:12:56.541
Get me a drink would you, Pim?

01:13:01.667 --> 01:13:04.374
No, I'll have some wine.

01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:06.458
Wine, okay.

01:13:07.625 --> 01:13:09.874
Red is the colour of love.

01:13:14.042 --> 01:13:16.416
Zoltan, you look sharp.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:18.666
Yes, ready to party.

01:13:20.125 --> 01:13:22.666
Glass of wine, Zoltan?

01:13:23.292 --> 01:13:24.833
Thank you, Little Pim.

01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:35.749
Thank you.

01:13:50.292 --> 01:13:54.624
- Little Pim. See you later.
- Bye bye.

01:13:57.167 --> 01:13:59.208
You crazy boy.

01:16:27.834 --> 01:16:30.458
He must have been out wandering.

01:16:30.667 --> 01:16:32.208
He's been asleep
on the sofa all day.

01:16:32.417 --> 01:16:33.666
And he's just woken up.

01:16:33.875 --> 01:16:36.916
You don't need to tell
me that, I live here.

01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:40.624
Here, for you.

01:16:45.375 --> 01:16:48.999
You can stay in
Gino's room tonight.

01:16:51.834 --> 01:16:57.249
And tomorrow.
And the next day.

01:17:03.459 --> 01:17:06.249
Your soup is getting
cold, Sabrina.

01:17:09.542 --> 01:17:12.333
Pim can't just move in with us.

01:17:13.125 --> 01:17:15.124
He's always been a
friend of the family.

01:17:15.334 --> 01:17:18.166
Yes, I've noticed.

01:17:18.625 --> 01:17:21.208
As if that was such
a problem for you.

01:17:21.417 --> 01:17:23.041
That was then.

01:17:25.292 --> 01:17:27.791
Little Pim has found
his way back.

01:17:28.334 --> 01:17:32.958
We barely saw him the whole time
the carnie lived with him.

01:17:33.167 --> 01:17:34.583
And did you know
that Pim and Gino...

01:17:34.792 --> 01:17:36.208
He's staying here.

01:17:36.417 --> 01:17:39.416
The boy has never
had a real home.

01:17:39.875 --> 01:17:40.624
Fine mother she is.

01:17:40.834 --> 01:17:44.333
Gone with the wind.

01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:51.333
Yvette... Not even your father
was safe from that slut.

01:17:52.417 --> 01:17:54.124
That rhymes.

01:17:55.084 --> 01:17:56.541
Yvette Mimosa.

01:17:56.750 --> 01:18:01.208
With her mannerisms
and her accordion.

01:18:02.375 --> 01:18:05.124
That pale cow thought she
could have any man she wanted.

01:18:05.334 --> 01:18:07.874
One after the other.

01:18:08.667 --> 01:18:12.291
She was fickle, Miss Camping.
She still is.

01:18:14.917 --> 01:18:17.333
My handsome Stefano.

01:18:18.542 --> 01:18:20.958
Don't you have a picture?

01:18:21.167 --> 01:18:23.083
Surely every wife
has a picture of...

01:18:23.292 --> 01:18:26.374
Don't ask me those questions.

01:18:29.459 --> 01:18:32.166
I need to get my kidneys checked.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.458
I deserve to know what
my father looked like.

01:18:35.667 --> 01:18:40.541
Sabrina, I have, I can't...

01:18:41.959 --> 01:18:45.041
Is he still alive?
Or don't you know that either?

01:18:45.584 --> 01:18:47.124
No, I don't know.

01:18:47.334 --> 01:18:50.624
And I won't have you
snapping at me, understood?

01:20:16.750 --> 01:20:19.541
I used to be better
at things like this.

01:20:38.084 --> 01:20:40.583
Shall I put some tea on?

01:20:47.375 --> 01:20:48.874
Where are you off to?

01:20:49.084 --> 01:20:52.041
Nowhere special.
I just need some fresh air.

01:20:52.459 --> 01:20:55.041
- Put a jacket on.
- Mother, it's summer.

01:20:55.250 --> 01:21:00.249
But it's like autumn. And pass
by the butcher's on your way back.

01:21:00.750 --> 01:21:05.374
- Who says I'm coming back?
- Half a pound of bacon, please.

01:22:22.584 --> 01:22:24.458
It happened so fast...

01:23:19.542 --> 01:23:21.208
My bag.

01:23:24.542 --> 01:23:26.833
Where were you planning to go?

01:23:46.459 --> 01:23:49.249
What are you looking for?
Can I help?

01:24:01.917 --> 01:24:03.583
Your father.

01:24:08.750 --> 01:24:10.499
Look.

01:24:30.209 --> 01:24:31.833
Mother?

01:24:41.375 --> 01:24:43.166
Mother.

01:27:07.375 --> 01:27:12.291
A, B, C, D, E...

01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:18.999
F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M...

01:27:19.792 --> 01:27:24.666
N, O, P, Q, R...

01:27:24.875 --> 01:27:30.874
S, T, U , V, W, X, Y, Z.

01:27:34.292 --> 01:27:36.291
Sea.

01:28:20.084 --> 01:28:21.958
Where is Françoise?

01:28:23.917 --> 01:28:26.458
She's not feeling very well.

01:28:27.709 --> 01:28:30.041
What a cow.

01:29:19.709 --> 01:29:21.916
Would you like some water?

01:29:22.125 --> 01:29:23.874
Yes, please.

01:29:57.625 --> 01:30:01.791
house to let

01:30:07.959 --> 01:30:10.916
Mrs Desmet found some of
your mother's stuff there.

01:30:11.125 --> 01:30:13.749
She asked what she
should do with it.

01:30:13.959 --> 01:30:15.708
Throw it away.

01:30:22.042 --> 01:30:27.041
Make yourself a sandwich. Maybe
I'll get to take something home.

01:30:39.834 --> 01:30:42.291
Shit weather.

01:30:43.875 --> 01:30:46.166
Can I come in?

01:30:47.084 --> 01:30:49.291
Quiet, Mirza.

01:31:04.792 --> 01:31:08.083
Shit weather,
you can say that again.

01:31:11.209 --> 01:31:12.999
Your sister isn't here.

01:31:13.209 --> 01:31:16.083
- Mondays, Tuesdays and...
- I'm here for you.

01:31:33.834 --> 01:31:34.916
Here.

01:31:38.042 --> 01:31:41.374
- You want something to drink?
- A beer.

01:31:57.875 --> 01:32:00.041
I'm only here temporarily.

01:32:02.042 --> 01:32:04.374
You know that.

01:32:06.167 --> 01:32:07.708
Temporarily.

01:32:21.250 --> 01:32:24.041
What do you want from me?

01:32:40.250 --> 01:32:42.749
I waited for you.

01:32:53.667 --> 01:32:57.874
Here. I don't need it back.
I gave it you.

01:33:01.042 --> 01:33:02.958
Tie a knot in it...

01:33:04.875 --> 01:33:07.333
so you won't forget me.

01:33:32.584 --> 01:33:34.416
Stay.
