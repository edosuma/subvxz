No one could ever take
your place, Da.

15:42.008 --> 15:43.310
Yeah, yeah.

15:46.479 --> 15:48.048
So, where's Vic?

15:49.649 --> 15:53.353
He's with your Uncle Paulie,
doing collections,

15:53.386 --> 15:55.655
and then meeting
some of the men later.

15:57.424 --> 15:59.092
Where's the meet?
I could go.

16:00.460 --> 16:03.063
And why the hell would
I want you to do that?

16:04.497 --> 16:06.466
Victor's got it under control.

16:12.706 --> 16:14.274
<i>How are the books?</i>

16:14.307 --> 16:18.044
Books are fine, Da.
They're always fine.

16:18.078 --> 16:21.147
That's why you're in charge.

16:21.181 --> 16:23.116
I depend on you.

16:23.149 --> 16:25.218
Well, you could depend
on me for more.

16:25.251 --> 16:27.721
You should depend
on me for more.

16:29.222 --> 16:32.092
Vic's not cut out
for this kind of work, Da.

16:32.125 --> 16:34.094
You should at least
let me help him.

16:34.127 --> 16:36.329
Jesus Christ, you think
'cause you beat your brother

16:36.363 --> 16:38.998
in a couple of games of chess
when you were kids,

16:39.032 --> 16:41.067
you're ready for the street?

16:41.101 --> 16:44.003
Come here.
Come here.

16:47.407 --> 16:48.575
Hands.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.580
What do you think
you can do with these?

16:53.613 --> 16:56.116
How the fuck do you
throw punches with them?

16:57.317 --> 17:01.454
What Victor does
is not women's work.

17:03.022 --> 17:07.360
Claudia, you are
a beautiful young woman.

17:07.394 --> 17:09.396
Can't you just accept that?

17:09.429 --> 17:12.298
<i>The natural order of things--</i>

17:12.332 --> 17:14.601
<i>Victor runs the streets,</i>

17:14.634 --> 17:16.469
you keep us legit,

17:16.503 --> 17:18.505
and you look after me.

17:27.580 --> 17:29.549
I like the way
you handle yourself.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.385
You show...

17:34.354 --> 17:36.156
...restraint.

17:38.324 --> 17:40.160
Thanks.

17:40.193 --> 17:41.561
I respect that.

17:44.464 --> 17:46.566
I didn't catch your name.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.136
I didn't throw it.

17:50.170 --> 17:52.338
Are you coming or going?

17:54.073 --> 17:55.475
Definitely going.

17:56.242 --> 17:59.245
Probably a wise choice after
pissing off the Flynn family.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.817
That name supposed to mean
something to me?

18:03.850 --> 18:07.387
You don't want to stick
around Chicago to find out.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.161
Money's good.
See you next month.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.362
Glo, wait.

18:16.396 --> 18:18.198
Vic, I got too much shit to do.

18:18.231 --> 18:19.566
Come on, let's get
the fuck out of here.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.367
I got the house
in New Buffalo for the weekend.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.671
What is New Buffalo gonna do?

18:24.704 --> 18:26.206
Give us a chance to talk.

18:26.239 --> 18:27.507
About what, Vic?

18:27.540 --> 18:28.842
We've already talked.
There's nothing left to say.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.211
- Why?
- 'Cause nothing's changed.

18:31.244 --> 18:32.846
And as long
as your father keeps

18:32.879 --> 18:35.181
putting money in your pocket
and pulling all the strings,

18:35.215 --> 18:36.249
nothing ever will, right?

18:36.282 --> 18:37.517
It's not about
the fucking money.

18:37.550 --> 18:38.818
It's about you and me.

18:40.186 --> 18:41.287
He's my father.

18:41.321 --> 18:42.455
I can't just...

18:44.557 --> 18:45.892
Look, I got a plan.

18:46.125 --> 18:49.762
Okay, when the time is right,
I'll talk to him.

18:49.796 --> 18:50.797
Okay? I'll tell him.

18:50.830 --> 18:51.898
Vic.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.566
I swear to God,
I'm fucking ready.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.472
Just tell me I'm not too late.

19:02.675 --> 19:05.211
I can't tell you that, Vic.

19:05.245 --> 19:06.846
I can't.

19:25.465 --> 19:26.733
- Hey.
- Yeah?

19:26.766 --> 19:27.867
I need you at the drop later.

19:27.901 --> 19:29.502
Please don't get fucked up,
all right?

19:29.536 --> 19:30.904
Come on, you know I stopped
drinking three months ago.

19:30.937 --> 19:32.472
I'm good. Go.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.173
Yeah. Make sure nobody fucks
with her, all right?

19:34.207 --> 19:35.208
All right, done.

19:36.376 --> 19:38.311
All right, ladies,
so let's get this drink thing

19:38.344 --> 19:39.846
out of the way.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.714
Count's good here.
Let's roll.

19:48.922 --> 19:50.490
Whatever you're thinking
about doing,

19:50.523 --> 19:52.425
forget it and move on.

19:52.458 --> 19:54.861
Let it go.
It ain't fucking worth it.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.634
Wherever the road takes you,

20:01.668 --> 20:03.436
make sure it's far
away from here.

20:04.771 --> 20:05.972
Safe travels.

20:18.685 --> 20:21.554
Oh, you came back.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.656
I was promised
some exceptional food.

20:24.958 --> 20:26.726
- Who's that for?
- <i>That is for you.</i>

20:26.759 --> 20:27.961
I'm not a rum guy.

20:27.994 --> 20:29.896
Tonight you are.

20:29.929 --> 20:31.564
<i>Get out of my face, boy.</i>

20:31.598 --> 20:32.932
What do you say
we get out of here?

20:33.866 --> 20:36.536
Get the fuck off of me,
all right?

20:36.569 --> 20:37.837
<i>I mean, what do you think?</i>

20:37.870 --> 20:39.606
<i>Get off of me,
you piece of shit.</i>

20:39.639 --> 20:41.274
<i>Don't you ever fucking
touch me again.</i>

20:41.307 --> 20:42.542
<i>- Do you understand?</i>
- You good, hon?

20:42.575 --> 20:43.977
- Let's be friends.
- You good, hon?

20:44.010 --> 20:46.679
I was good before this piece
of shit came up to me.

20:46.713 --> 20:47.947
Right.

20:49.682 --> 20:51.317
Fuck you still doing here,
Simon?

20:51.351 --> 20:53.019
- I'm doing--
- I don't need a babysitter.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.855
So eat, drink,
or get the fuck out.

20:55.888 --> 20:58.558
Careful who you talk
to like that.

20:58.591 --> 21:02.028
You're a bag man
and an errand boy, bitch.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.963
Get the fuck off me.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.743
Ooh! This look good.

21:16.776 --> 21:20.313
The menu's just for ambience.
You will eat what I bring you.

21:20.346 --> 21:22.515
Perfect.

21:26.552 --> 21:27.920
<i>Food will be out in five.</i>

21:39.966 --> 21:42.435
No. No, no, no, no.
I don't give a fuck.

21:43.469 --> 21:44.804
No, we ain't gotta do nothing
but make the deal

21:44.837 --> 21:46.873
and split, all right?
No, no, no.

21:46.906 --> 21:49.609
As long as their powder is
white and our paper is green,

21:49.642 --> 21:51.544
we're making a deal
with those Yardie fucks.

21:52.512 --> 21:54.447
Yeah, tonight, 3:00 a.m.

21:54.480 --> 21:55.481
Hey.

21:56.716 --> 21:57.850
Hey, pussy.

21:59.786 --> 22:00.787
Fuck!

22:03.890 --> 22:05.091
Fuck!

22:07.927 --> 22:09.629
Come here.
Fuckin'--

22:11.964 --> 22:14.901
Honestly,
Tom Brady can eat a dick.

22:14.934 --> 22:16.836
But Larry Bird?

22:16.869 --> 22:19.872
Larry Bird's
a goddamn national treasure.

22:21.441 --> 22:22.809
No! No! No, no!

22:22.842 --> 22:24.777
You ain't gotta do this.
You ain't gotta do this.

22:24.811 --> 22:26.612
I feel like I do.

22:27.847 --> 22:30.516
Ahh!

22:51.704 --> 22:53.473
Well, this might have
some blowback.

22:53.506 --> 22:54.774
Oh, yeah?

22:54.807 --> 22:57.677
Well, I ain't gonna be around
long enough to catch it.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.712
Any of that gonna fall on you?

23:00.713 --> 23:02.048
Not a drop.

23:03.616 --> 23:04.917
Good.

23:04.951 --> 23:08.054

24:14.687 --> 24:17.123
- Let the party begin.
- What are we drinking?

24:17.156 --> 24:20.593
From my grandfather's private
distillery outside Moscow.

24:20.626 --> 24:21.994
It's meant to be sipped.

24:23.529 --> 24:24.630
<i>Slowly.</i>

24:25.798 --> 24:27.567
Not tonight.

24:30.203 --> 24:33.005

me what to do for one lifetime.

24:37.844 --> 24:39.545
Who the fuck is that?

24:39.579 --> 24:41.581

26:41.801 --> 26:43.169
Do you have more?

27:03.289 --> 27:06.058
That was fun.

27:06.092 --> 27:07.660
Yeah.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.997
I ain't had fun like that
in a minute.

27:17.937 --> 27:20.072
I gotta--

27:20.106 --> 27:21.640
Yeah. Cool.

27:32.651 --> 27:33.786
You serve?

27:33.819 --> 27:35.021
Not mine.

27:36.789 --> 27:38.090
My husband.

27:39.191 --> 27:42.128
He deployed.
Never came back.

27:45.297 --> 27:47.833
Wrong people
always seem to die.

27:47.867 --> 27:50.102
When you're the one
left behind,

27:50.136 --> 27:54.106
you gotta wonder what
you're supposed to do about it.

28:02.915 --> 28:04.150
You like it?

28:06.085 --> 28:08.087
Being married?

28:10.723 --> 28:13.292
It wasn't long enough
to tell you.

28:13.325 --> 28:15.127
Think I would have, though.

28:16.829 --> 28:18.697
How about you?

28:18.731 --> 28:20.433
You tried?

28:21.767 --> 28:23.235
I got close once.

28:24.937 --> 28:26.739
Still got time to try it again.

28:29.442 --> 28:31.110
Maybe.

28:37.183 --> 28:38.350
Shit.

28:39.218 --> 28:40.286
Hey, look.

28:42.121 --> 28:43.823
I really gotta go.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.830
- Yeah, take care of yourself.
- <i>You too.</i>

28:59.839 --> 29:01.740
Simon, you flake motherfucker.

29:02.908 --> 29:04.443
Pick up!

29:08.214 --> 29:09.782
The fuck?

29:13.185 --> 29:15.855
The next two go into
your motherfucking head.

29:19.325 --> 29:21.026
Don't even try it.

29:24.130 --> 29:25.397
Give me.

29:25.431 --> 29:28.234
You know the fucking mistake
you're making?

29:28.267 --> 29:31.203
Bigger or smaller
than you flexing on me earlier?

29:32.271 --> 29:34.974
- Not even close.
- Turn off the lights, stupid.

29:35.975 --> 29:38.344
And get out
the motherfucking car. Now.

29:38.377 --> 29:41.113
I want you to introduce me
to your connect.

29:44.884 --> 29:46.919
How many they expecting
in there?

29:46.952 --> 29:50.489
Two. Just two.

29:50.523 --> 29:52.158
You gonna get the gate?

29:53.225 --> 29:55.094
I could kill you right here.

30:07.072 --> 30:08.941
How many gonna be in that room?

30:10.109 --> 30:12.478
Good. We got the numbers
in our favor.

30:15.981 --> 30:19.985
You gonna stop now?
I got zero fucks in me, kid.

30:20.019 --> 30:21.487
Let's go.

30:35.067 --> 30:36.502
<i>Yeah, boy, I feel like
I was getting my dick</i>

30:36.535 --> 30:39.872
sucked in a fucking jacuzzi
on a roller coaster, bro.

30:39.905 --> 30:41.307
Bro, how unbelievably

30:41.340 --> 30:43.542
<i>fucking sick would that be?
Rollerco--</i>

30:43.576 --> 30:44.910
What the fuck you doing here,
Flynn?

30:44.944 --> 30:46.312
I got a meet with Zamost.

30:46.345 --> 30:49.014
- Yeah, so do I.
- <i>This isn't a CBI deal.</i>

30:49.048 --> 30:51.417
It was supposed to be all CBI
till you just fucked it up.

30:51.450 --> 30:52.851
Clearly Zamost lied
to both of us.

30:52.885 --> 30:54.853
Yeah, everybody just shut
the fuck up.

30:54.887 --> 30:57.056
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm the only guy

30:57.089 --> 30:58.490
that doesn't have his head
up his own ass in here.

31:00.125 --> 31:02.895
Whoa! Everybody cool tonight?

31:02.928 --> 31:04.630
Let me rephrase that.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.232
We all plan
on staying cool tonight?

31:06.265 --> 31:07.967
Where the fuck's
the fucking money?

31:08.000 --> 31:09.468
Where the fuck is Zamost?

31:09.501 --> 31:11.370
How come he isn't here,
and why is CBI getting a cut?

31:11.403 --> 31:12.571
Yeah, why he send y'all two

31:12.605 --> 31:14.039
tweaked-out
goofy motherfuckers?

31:14.073 --> 31:15.874
Yo, just show us
the money, man. Please.

31:15.908 --> 31:17.443
Hey, why don't you
put your guns down?

31:17.476 --> 31:19.545
Hey, shut the fuck up!
Where's the money?

31:19.578 --> 31:22.014
Yeah. This shit right here,
this don't feel right.

31:22.047 --> 31:23.616
You just figuring
that out now?

31:25.484 --> 31:26.919
Zamost playing us, man.

31:26.952 --> 31:28.654
Fuck you!
Where's our fucking money?

31:28.887 --> 31:30.456
These boys is pinned
to the ceiling.

31:30.489 --> 31:31.957
Why don't you just break them
off the money that you owe them

31:31.991 --> 31:33.259
before this shit
goes all the way fucked.

31:33.292 --> 31:34.326
Fuck them.

31:34.360 --> 31:35.361
Disrespect me again,
motherfucker.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.663
Do you got the money or not?

31:37.896 --> 31:39.064
Most of it.

31:39.098 --> 31:41.300
Most--? You came light?

31:41.333 --> 31:42.568
You fucking
cocksucking mother--

31:42.601 --> 31:44.203
Aw, yeah, hell no.
Hey. Hey.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.205
Crack baby number one,
let me get my shit right there.

31:46.238 --> 31:48.240
Fuck you! Where's the money?

31:50.276 --> 31:53.545
Oh, fuck.
This your first deal.

31:54.980 --> 31:56.682
This ain't our first
fucking deal.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.484
Oh, yeah it is.

31:58.517 --> 32:00.152
Y'all breaking your cherries
right now.

32:00.185 --> 32:01.987
- Hey, we've done deals.
- Lots of deals.

32:02.021 --> 32:05.057
Oh, yeah? Well, then I'm- I'm
sure that you tested the purity

32:05.090 --> 32:07.326
of whatever you got
in that bag right there?

32:07.359 --> 32:08.661
No, you didn't make sure

32:08.694 --> 32:11.096
that wasn't stepped on
with lidocaine or levamisole?

32:11.130 --> 32:12.598
No, I ain't even heard
of lidocaine before.

32:12.631 --> 32:14.099
I don't even know
what you're talking about, man.

32:14.133 --> 32:15.534
We didn't step on shit.

32:15.567 --> 32:16.669
Why don't you just show us
what the fuck you got?

32:16.702 --> 32:18.570
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

32:20.973 --> 32:22.341
Shit.
Fuck!

32:24.343 --> 32:25.444
<i>God damn it!</i>

32:27.546 --> 32:29.048
Fuck!

32:31.650 --> 32:33.052
Motherfucker!

32:35.387 --> 32:38.023
Ahh! Fuck! Ahh!

32:38.424 --> 32:40.225
<i>Ahh!</i>

32:40.259 --> 32:43.962
Fuck, bro.

32:46.665 --> 32:50.269
Oh, you gotta know your clip.
This ain't no video game.

32:51.170 --> 32:53.672
See, I got four bullets
left in this gun.

32:55.107 --> 32:56.542
Three.

32:57.643 --> 32:58.677
Two.

32:58.711 --> 33:01.180
Ahh! Fuck!

33:01.213 --> 33:02.748
You don't want to let me
get to one.

33:02.981 --> 33:05.084
Ahh! Ahh!

33:06.652 --> 33:08.620
Ahh! Fuck! Ahh!

33:08.654 --> 33:11.590
That shit would have never
gone sideways if I had my gun.

33:14.593 --> 33:17.429
Then here.
Take your gun.

33:22.401 --> 33:24.136
You still got one left.

33:27.773 --> 33:30.309
- So, this ain't your mans?
- Fuck, no.

33:32.077 --> 33:33.412
Who the fuck are you?

33:33.445 --> 33:36.014
I'm the motherfucker that
just saved both of your lives.

33:36.048 --> 33:38.283
And this fucking douchebag
came light.

33:41.186 --> 33:42.354
Did you come in here light?

33:42.388 --> 33:43.622
The fuck difference
does it make?

33:43.655 --> 33:45.424
A huge difference!

33:45.457 --> 33:47.426
Can you please tell me
who this guy is?

33:47.459 --> 33:50.229
He a little north side
bitch-ass motherfucker.

33:50.262 --> 33:51.430
Always shitting on CBI,

33:51.463 --> 33:52.698
when they the real
grimy motherfuckers.

33:52.731 --> 33:54.333
Let's not get
into a geographical

33:54.366 --> 33:55.601
and philosophical
fucking debate.

33:55.634 --> 33:57.269
We got the drugs
sitting right there.

33:57.302 --> 33:59.037
We keep the money
we walked in with.

33:59.071 --> 34:01.073
We'll chop the fucking pot.
It's not an issue.

34:01.106 --> 34:03.041
Yeah?
Well, this dead body right here

34:03.075 --> 34:04.443
look like
a big fucking issue to me.

34:04.476 --> 34:06.278
Especially since your old man
gonna try to pin it

34:06.311 --> 34:08.180
on a CBI nigga anyway.

34:08.213 --> 34:10.416
I'll take care of it.
All right?

34:12.418 --> 34:14.420
All right.

34:14.453 --> 34:16.155
Hey, my man,
you did your thing.

34:16.188 --> 34:17.689
Gratitude. Now bounce.

34:17.723 --> 34:19.725
My thing come with a fee.

34:21.794 --> 34:23.228
Pay him out of your end.

34:23.262 --> 34:25.230
Fuck no.

34:25.264 --> 34:27.199
This motherfucker just got
the drop on us.

34:27.232 --> 34:29.201
Only reason we getting
out of here right now

34:29.234 --> 34:31.670
<i>is 'cause of him, all right?
Fuck!</i>

34:33.172 --> 34:34.773
Fuck, man, pay him!

34:40.279 --> 34:42.481
<i>Fuck.</i>

34:42.514 --> 34:47.119
Hey, my man, that's my paper
in there too.

34:47.152 --> 34:49.121
You want to kick
that shit back?

34:56.328 --> 34:57.663
He's fucking dead.

35:02.534 --> 35:03.702
Fuck.

We used to run these corners,

35:40.439 --> 35:41.573
Yep.

35:42.908 --> 35:45.210
But none of us here, J.

35:46.678 --> 35:50.582
Shit, bro, all the crews
we came up with are fractured.

35:50.616 --> 35:52.217
<i>Nations are falling.</i>

35:52.251 --> 35:53.752
Beef within crews,
jumping off block-to-block.

35:53.785 --> 35:56.288
These little niggas crazy
out here, bro.

35:56.321 --> 35:59.791
And we the last to hold out.
Thanks to you.

36:01.894 --> 36:03.695
Just doing what I had to.

36:03.729 --> 36:04.930
Which is why I'm so confused

36:05.163 --> 36:06.698
to why you dealing
with the Yardies.

36:06.732 --> 36:09.368
Come on, bro, why we back
on this bullshit?

36:09.401 --> 36:10.669
Didn't we go through
this already?

36:10.702 --> 36:12.237
I may have missed something.

36:12.271 --> 36:14.339
So just run that shit
past me again.

36:14.373 --> 36:16.675
A'ight. This crazy white boy
came through with Vic Flynn

36:16.708 --> 36:19.511
and straight Bin Ladened
the whole shit, bro. That's it.

36:19.545 --> 36:20.846
And we got confirmation

36:20.879 --> 36:22.814
he not rolling
with Walter Flynn's crew?

36:22.848 --> 36:26.285
Bro, look.

36:26.318 --> 36:28.587
The man ran the whole room.

36:28.620 --> 36:31.223
A'ight, he dipped
with the bread and the butter.

36:31.256 --> 36:34.626
Now, if he was with Walter--
think about it, bro--

36:34.660 --> 36:37.329
why would he come down
so heavy on his own boy?

36:37.362 --> 36:39.965
He fucked Vic up, bro.

36:41.199 --> 36:44.469
And this crazy white boy,
he just saved your ass

36:44.503 --> 36:46.672
- and just kept on--
- I told you, my gun jammed.

36:46.705 --> 36:48.273
And this crazy white boy

36:48.307 --> 36:50.242
saved your alleged
gun-jamming ass

36:50.275 --> 36:52.911
and just bounced with your
paper and the Yardies' drugs?

36:54.513 --> 36:56.982
Like Casper
the motherfucking ghost, man.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.217
Hm. Okay.

37:00.619 --> 37:02.254
Let's find Casper.

37:04.556 --> 37:05.891
So other than you almost dying

37:05.924 --> 37:07.726
and this guy saving your ass,

37:07.759 --> 37:09.528
what the fuck were you doing
with the Yardies?

37:09.561 --> 37:12.464
- It's a new revenue stream.
- It's a bad product.

37:12.497 --> 37:13.932
The Yardies produce
bathtub crank.

37:13.966 --> 37:15.767
Those college kids
from Glencoe at Northwestern,

37:15.801 --> 37:17.603
they don't know the difference
between that and coke.

37:17.636 --> 37:19.004
That's not your call to make.

37:19.237 --> 37:20.872
As long as Pop sits
on his bullshit with CBI,

37:20.906 --> 37:22.874
we're never getting
a coke connect, you know that.

37:22.908 --> 37:25.410
Getting caught up in some
low-rent shit while the feds

37:25.444 --> 37:27.846
are sniffing around
is not a good look for us.

37:27.879 --> 37:29.448
The reason we're not in coke

37:29.481 --> 37:31.016
is because it fucks
with our very legitimate front.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.018
- Yeah, I get that.
- Do you?

37:33.251 --> 37:35.821
Because making shit deals
is not the way to move forward.

37:41.526 --> 37:43.362
I don't want
to worry about you.

37:44.463 --> 37:45.998
You don't have to.

37:47.766 --> 37:49.001
On Mom.

37:55.574 --> 37:57.876
If she was still alive,
she'd be worried too.

38:00.345 --> 38:01.647
Yeah.

38:04.016 --> 38:05.984
Don't be stupid.

38:06.952 --> 38:09.888
Don't worry about me.
Worry about you.

39:26.064 --> 39:27.666
Hey, how's it going?

39:29.067 --> 39:30.669
It's been a minute.

39:31.970 --> 39:34.106
I mean, I ain't seen you
since I was four.

39:35.707 --> 39:40.645
You know, my mother
told me you was dead.

39:42.380 --> 39:43.782
You believe that shit?

39:50.455 --> 39:51.857
Hey.

39:54.860 --> 39:56.561
You know who I am?

40:05.971 --> 40:09.441
Tommy. Here.

40:15.080 --> 40:17.115
Tommy!

40:17.149 --> 40:19.985
Yeah. Yeah.

40:54.986 --> 40:56.521
Who sent you?

40:57.088 --> 40:59.524
The fuck were you doing
with Miriam Egan?

40:59.558 --> 41:01.993
No one's been to visit her
in six fucking years, but me.

41:02.027 --> 41:04.796
- And who the fuck are you?
- I'm her grandson.

41:04.830 --> 41:06.832
Who the fuck are you?

41:10.702 --> 41:12.604
I'm her fucking grandson.

41:16.241 --> 41:18.076
What you know about that?

41:25.817 --> 41:27.853
This what the fuck
I know about that.

41:34.659 --> 41:36.895
Look, this is a lot
for me to process.

41:36.928 --> 41:38.597
For me too.

41:38.630 --> 41:40.732
Jesus, you think I was planning
on waking up today

41:40.765 --> 41:42.667
finding out I have a brother?

41:44.636 --> 41:47.105
My pops said my mom was dead.

41:47.138 --> 41:49.007
Gone.

41:49.040 --> 41:50.976
He never said shit
about her being alive.

41:51.009 --> 41:53.211
Yeah, well, nobody said
nothing about you.

41:54.112 --> 41:55.780
What the fuck?

41:56.781 --> 41:58.984
I been living my whole life
as a fucking lie.

42:02.888 --> 42:05.156
- Here.
- No, it fucks with my voice.

42:05.190 --> 42:07.692
I don't that shit could get
much deeper.

42:07.726 --> 42:08.960
Go on, take it.

42:16.067 --> 42:18.069
You want to tell me
why you're packing?

42:20.839 --> 42:22.107
Okay, cool.

42:22.140 --> 42:25.677
- So your old man raised you?
- Yep.

42:25.710 --> 42:27.078
There for me 24/7.

42:27.112 --> 42:29.114
Wow.

42:31.049 --> 42:33.084
There any more of us?

42:33.118 --> 42:34.586
I don't think so.

42:34.619 --> 42:37.122
But who the fuck knows,
with her.

42:37.155 --> 42:39.958
Anything you want to tell me
about this Katherine?

42:39.991 --> 42:41.993
Any details?

42:42.027 --> 42:43.295
First of all,
she ain't royalty.

42:43.328 --> 42:45.063
Ain't nobody
call her Katherine.

42:45.096 --> 42:47.866
It's Kate, and she ain't worth
your trouble or your tears.

42:47.899 --> 42:50.568
You got out ahead on this deal.
Trust me.

42:51.803 --> 42:53.204
Those enough details?

42:53.238 --> 42:55.840
Yeah. It is.

43:00.645 --> 43:03.348
So, uh...

43:05.317 --> 43:07.319
Why don't you
give me your number,

43:07.352 --> 43:10.989
and I'll call you or some shit?

43:11.022 --> 43:13.792
You know, when we wrap
our heads around this thing?

43:14.693 --> 43:17.295
Yeah. Yeah, a'ight.

43:20.799 --> 43:24.836
So, all I know is her name
is Kate...

43:27.639 --> 43:30.141
...she has a white son
who she stayed with,

43:30.175 --> 43:32.077
and she's not dead.

43:33.745 --> 43:35.680
She is to me.

44:08.113 --> 44:09.647
You know, when you told me

44:09.681 --> 44:13.151
that this place
was going under,

44:13.184 --> 44:15.220
it just...

44:24.396 --> 44:27.165
<i>Thanks for keeping
the rent up on it.</i>

44:27.198 --> 44:29.701
- I didn't.
- Didn't what?

44:29.734 --> 44:31.836
Keep up on the rent.

44:31.870 --> 44:33.972
But we just came through
the front with the keys.

44:34.005 --> 44:35.273
That's because I decided

44:35.306 --> 44:37.776
it was better to be
a owner than a tenant.

44:37.809 --> 44:39.377
Man, get the fuck
out of here.

44:42.747 --> 44:44.849
- You fucking own this spot?
- <i>No.</i>

44:46.718 --> 44:49.020
<i>You do.</i>

44:49.054 --> 44:50.755
<i>It's all above board.</i>

44:50.789 --> 44:53.391
Clean title.
No mortgage.

44:54.759 --> 44:56.361
Property taxes
and business license

44:56.394 --> 44:59.130
is current and paid in full.

45:01.132 --> 45:02.734
You good, boy.

45:05.370 --> 45:06.771
I love you, boy.

45:06.805 --> 45:09.340
- Man, thank you for this.
- Always. Yes, sir.

45:10.375 --> 45:14.145
I mean, this--I can't believe
you did this for me, J.

45:14.179 --> 45:16.147
Come on, man.

45:16.181 --> 45:17.982
You know it ain't a thing
on God's green

45:18.016 --> 45:19.451
I wouldn't do for you.

45:19.484 --> 45:22.887
Shit, all you gotta now, bro,

45:22.921 --> 45:25.757
<i>throw you a little fresh coat
a paint on them walls outside,</i>

45:25.790 --> 45:27.826
<i>and shit, I don't know, maybe
change the name or something,</i>

45:27.859 --> 45:29.461
<i>and you'll be good to go.</i>

45:29.494 --> 45:33.398
The name stays the same.
This is where we were born.

45:36.734 --> 45:39.771
This is where we were baptized.

45:41.873 --> 45:44.342
- Hm?
- Got you. Got you.

45:46.478 --> 45:49.514
And this

45:49.747 --> 45:53.284
is where Chicago Brothers
Incorporated came from.

45:53.318 --> 45:55.019
CBI.

45:56.454 --> 45:58.790
You look good sitting
in that chair.

45:58.823 --> 46:00.825
You back where
you belong, baby.

46:00.859 --> 46:02.460
Feels good to be back.

46:04.028 --> 46:06.498
But I'm not the same person
I was when I left.

46:08.399 --> 46:10.502
I've changed.

46:10.535 --> 46:12.137
<i>All that random
shit popping off</i>

46:12.170 --> 46:14.105
<i>everywhere has gotta end, J.</i>

46:14.139 --> 46:16.074
<i>That's not how we do business.</i>

46:16.107 --> 46:19.978
That's not how I do business.
It's not CBI.

46:29.254 --> 46:31.856
A lot of shit has changed
in 15 years.

46:33.091 --> 46:37.295
Maybe.
But I'm done killing people.

46:39.364 --> 46:41.266
I mean, shit,
you a free man, nigga.

46:41.299 --> 46:43.568
You can do whatever the fuck
you want to do.

46:43.801 --> 46:44.969
<i>But let's park</i>

46:45.003 --> 46:46.404
<i>that philosophical shit
for a minute.</i>

46:46.437 --> 46:47.906
I'm gonna go take care
of some shit.

46:47.939 --> 46:50.241
But I'ma be back.
I'm taking you out tonight.

46:50.275 --> 46:52.377
All right? I'ma show you
what you been missing.

46:52.410 --> 46:54.812
I got you.
Love you, boy.

46:54.846 --> 46:56.314
Yeah, a'ight.

47:40.458 --> 47:41.960
Fuck.

47:48.600 --> 47:50.235
Fuck.

47:52.503 --> 47:54.239
Fuck me.

48:02.180 --> 48:04.649
Hey, sorry, brother.
We're not officially open yet,

48:04.882 --> 48:07.318
but give us a few days,
we got you.

48:07.352 --> 48:10.021
Man, I love this shop.

48:11.990 --> 48:14.025
Yeah. It's special.

48:14.058 --> 48:15.360
Well, listen,
if you come back--

48:15.393 --> 48:17.395
I've been coming here
a minute, I don't...

48:18.596 --> 48:20.431
I don't think I've seen you.

48:21.966 --> 48:23.901
Haven't been around much.

48:24.969 --> 48:28.006
No? Where you been?

48:30.208 --> 48:31.542
Places.

48:31.576 --> 48:35.213
Places. A'ight.

48:36.347 --> 48:37.915
<i>Hmm.</i>

48:37.949 --> 48:41.185
Yo, that smell brings you
back every time, though, right?

48:47.959 --> 48:49.227
Sorry.

48:53.631 --> 48:55.066
Yeah.

48:57.502 --> 49:01.272
<i>Okay. Copy that.
Be there in five.</i>

49:06.177 --> 49:09.414
So, you're the new owner?

49:11.416 --> 49:12.650
Yeah.

49:14.585 --> 49:16.220
So if I want that cut,
I can come through

49:16.254 --> 49:19.691
in a few days,
and you'll clean me up?

49:20.958 --> 49:22.427
Bet.

49:23.328 --> 49:25.196
First one's on the house.

49:26.364 --> 49:30.368
Good looking,
but I always pay my way.

49:32.603 --> 49:35.006
<i>Welcome back, Diamond.</i>

49:50.555 --> 49:51.622
Hello?

49:51.656 --> 49:52.990
<i>Where the fuck are you, man?</i>

49:53.024 --> 49:55.393
Rodolfo, why you fucking
up my ass on this?

49:55.426 --> 49:58.196
<i>Hey, you want to roll
back with the attitude,</i> pendejo?

49:58.229 --> 50:00.098
<i>You're talking to your boss.</i>

50:00.131 --> 50:02.166
Yo, man, you might want
to chill on that shit.

50:02.200 --> 50:03.668
I ain't nobody's employee.

50:08.373 --> 50:10.007
Let me call you back.

50:17.048 --> 50:18.249
What the fuck?

50:46.544 --> 50:48.146
I told you you didn't want
to stick around

50:48.179 --> 50:50.214
to find out
who you were fucking with.

50:50.248 --> 50:52.083
What can I tell you?

50:52.116 --> 50:54.485
I got a short fuse
and a long memory.

50:55.420 --> 50:56.621
Drive.

51:07.298 --> 51:08.366
Park it here.

51:17.475 --> 51:18.776
This way.

51:46.637 --> 51:47.805
This him?

51:48.639 --> 51:50.775
This Jesse fucking James?

51:50.808 --> 51:52.710
<i>In the fucking flesh.</i>

51:58.382 --> 52:00.551
Walter Flynn.

52:00.585 --> 52:03.454
You made quite the impact
on my family here.

52:03.488 --> 52:05.490
<i>And my city.</i>

52:06.557 --> 52:07.758
There hasn't been
this much heat

52:07.792 --> 52:10.628
since Mrs. O'Leary's cow
kicked over that lantern.

52:12.330 --> 52:13.865
Mrs. who?

52:14.899 --> 52:17.368
You know who the first victim
of that fire was?

52:17.401 --> 52:19.370
I'm guessing the cow.

52:19.403 --> 52:21.739
The cow. Exactly.

52:21.772 --> 52:24.575
<i>It was sacrificial.</i>

52:24.609 --> 52:28.412
Immediate retribution
for its sin.

52:28.446 --> 52:31.148
<i>Swift. Biblical.</i>

52:31.182 --> 52:32.650
I find that's the best way

52:32.683 --> 52:35.853
of dealing
with these situations

52:35.887 --> 52:37.688
when they arise.

52:42.360 --> 52:45.429
Can we stop talking about
cows and Bibles

52:45.463 --> 52:46.931
and get to the point?

52:48.199 --> 52:50.902
<i>I'm guessing you brought me
here for one of two reasons.</i>

52:50.935 --> 52:52.837
And since I ain't dead yet...

52:54.539 --> 52:56.474
...you're welcome
for saving your son.

53:02.613 --> 53:03.848
<i>Hey.</i>

53:05.650 --> 53:07.785
Where you headed, son?

53:07.818 --> 53:09.587
West.

53:10.488 --> 53:12.657
And when are you
supposed to arrive?

53:14.258 --> 53:17.295
- I ain't in no rush.
- Ah.

53:17.328 --> 53:19.897
A man with no clock
has two things:

53:19.931 --> 53:23.367
too much time
or too much money.

53:24.936 --> 53:28.873
Either way, you're gonna
eventually run out of both.

53:30.675 --> 53:32.910
<i>Now, these fires
you've set here,</i>

53:32.944 --> 53:35.646
I'm gonna put them out for you.

53:35.680 --> 53:37.915
As my appreciation.

53:38.783 --> 53:41.953
<i>But your time here in Chicago
has come to an end.</i>

53:43.588 --> 53:46.624
You gotta get the fuck
out of my city, son.

53:49.527 --> 53:50.828
Sorry I'm late.

53:50.861 --> 53:52.463
<i>That's all right,
