00:03.204 --> 00:05.339
DISPATCHER (over radio):
One Two Sector Adam,
what's your location?

00:05.373 --> 00:07.108
OFFICER: One Two Adam
to Central.
(siren wailing)

00:07.141 --> 00:08.209
Suspects are southbound
on Lenox

00:08.242 --> 00:10.044
at 122 street,
going toward 121.

00:10.078 --> 00:11.779
DISPATCHER (over radio):
10-4, One Two Adam.

00:11.812 --> 00:13.281
OFFICER: Whoa, whoa, whoa,
they're cutting left!

00:13.314 --> 00:15.383
(horn blaring)
Central, this is One Two Adam.

00:15.416 --> 00:17.285
Now heading westbound on 121.

00:17.318 --> 00:19.553
Suspects are two black males,
early 20s,

00:19.587 --> 00:21.255
one in a black jacket
with a hoodie,

00:21.289 --> 00:22.356
one in a red jacket,
gray hoodie.

00:22.390 --> 00:23.357
Both in blue jeans.

00:23.391 --> 00:24.525
DISPATCHER (over radio):
Copy that, One Two Adam.

00:24.558 --> 00:27.561
I need any available units
to report to 121 and Lenox.

00:27.595 --> 00:30.098
Officers in pursuit
of robbery suspects.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.599
Central, suspects are now
northbound in an alley

00:31.632 --> 00:33.134
next to the sporting goods store

00:33.167 --> 00:35.236
heading toward 122.
In pursuit.

00:35.269 --> 00:36.237
(tires screech)

00:36.270 --> 00:37.438
Hey, police!

00:37.471 --> 00:40.341
Sector Adam Shield
198 to Central.

00:40.374 --> 00:41.275
198, go.

00:41.309 --> 00:43.711
OFFICER: We're 84,
pursuing suspect on foot

00:43.744 --> 00:45.479
northbound in an alley
towards 122.

00:45.513 --> 00:46.614
Copy that, 198.

00:46.647 --> 00:47.848
Units responding.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.218
Be advised, Sector Adam
are on foot in the alley

00:50.251 --> 00:53.221
heading northbound toward 122.

00:53.254 --> 00:55.289
OFFICER (over radio):
Sector Adam 841 to Central!

00:55.323 --> 00:57.258
Suspect scaled
a barbed wire fence!

00:57.291 --> 00:59.593
(static) ...heading eastbound
toward Lenox!

00:59.627 --> 01:01.862
DISPATCHER:
841, repeat. I didn't copy that.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.165
841, go again.

01:04.197 --> 01:06.500
(distorted shouting,
static crackling)

01:06.534 --> 01:08.369
198, stand by.

01:08.402 --> 01:09.770
841, go.

01:09.803 --> 01:11.439
841, do you have a visual?

01:11.472 --> 01:13.307
OFFICER:
Uh, negative. I'm doubling back.

01:13.341 --> 01:14.642
OFFICER 2: ...shots fired!
DISPATCHER: All units, stand by.

01:14.675 --> 01:15.809
198, you're breaking up.

01:15.843 --> 01:17.878
Come in to Central.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.414
OFFICER: Do you have
a 10-7 on my partner?

01:20.448 --> 01:21.782
DISPATCHER:
All units, stand by.

01:21.815 --> 01:23.284
198, what is your location?

01:23.317 --> 01:24.852
OFFICER 2:
Suspect is headed...

01:24.885 --> 01:26.454
Police! Show me your hands!

01:26.487 --> 01:28.256
(gunshot)

01:28.289 --> 01:30.458
DISPATCHER:
198, come in to Central.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.594
198, come in to Central.

01:33.627 --> 01:35.463
198, do you copy?

01:36.864 --> 01:38.566
CROWD (chanting):
There was no gun!

01:38.599 --> 01:42.470
There was no gun! There was
no gun! There was no gun!

01:42.503 --> 01:44.172
REPORTER:
Ted, I'm learning

01:44.205 --> 01:47.208
that the victim of the shooting,
Timothy Brown, was allegedly

01:47.241 --> 01:48.276
involved in a jewelry
store robbery

01:48.309 --> 01:51.645
with an accomplice who
has not been apprehended.

01:51.679 --> 01:52.746
An anonymous

01:52.780 --> 01:54.648
high-ranking official
has revealed,

01:54.682 --> 01:56.517
however, that Timothy Brown,

01:56.550 --> 02:00.321
a college student, was unarmed
at the time of the shooting.

02:00.354 --> 02:03.691
This is the second fatality
at the hands of police

02:03.724 --> 02:06.327
in less than a week,
and as you know,

02:06.360 --> 02:08.529
the other victim was gunned
down just blocks from here

02:08.562 --> 02:10.497
and was unarmed as well.

02:10.531 --> 02:12.366
CROWD (chanting):
There was no gun!

02:12.400 --> 02:14.402
I don't know how many times
I got to say it.

02:14.435 --> 02:16.670
He had a gun;
the kid took a shot at me.

02:16.704 --> 02:17.571
You called it in?

02:17.605 --> 02:19.473
Yeah, I called it in.

02:19.507 --> 02:20.341
So what happened to the gun?

02:20.374 --> 02:21.709
I don't know.

02:21.742 --> 02:22.676
Don't you think

02:22.710 --> 02:23.844
I would tell you that

02:23.877 --> 02:25.546
if I knew?
There's 200 people outside

02:25.579 --> 02:27.915
that would like to take
a baseball bat to my head!

02:27.948 --> 02:29.417
A kid robs a jewelry store,

02:29.450 --> 02:31.285
and it's my word
that's in question?

02:31.319 --> 02:32.453
Kevin, relax, buddy.

02:32.486 --> 02:35.356
No one's questioning
your word, Kevin.

02:35.389 --> 02:37.858
We're just trying to
work out what happened.

02:37.891 --> 02:40.361
The more we know,
the more we can control

02:40.394 --> 02:42.596
any misinformation
that gets out there, all right?

02:42.630 --> 02:46.367
Trey and I got separated

02:46.400 --> 02:48.436
when the two of them split up
in the alley.

02:48.469 --> 02:52.340
Suspect is running northbound
in a tunnel towards 122.

02:55.443 --> 02:57.211
Stop, stop!

02:57.245 --> 02:58.546
Police!

03:01.782 --> 03:04.618
Stop! Stop!

03:04.652 --> 03:07.521
198 in pursuit
down the alley behind, uh...

03:07.555 --> 03:08.656
DISPATCHER:
198, stand by.

03:08.689 --> 03:10.858
841... 841,
do you have a visual?

03:10.891 --> 03:13.327
OFFICER:
Uh, negative. I'm doubling back.

03:13.361 --> 03:14.528
(gunshot)

03:14.562 --> 03:17.531
10-13, 10-13, shots fired!

03:17.565 --> 03:18.666
DISPATCHER (staticky):
All... stand by.

03:18.699 --> 03:22.236
198, you're breaking... Central.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.278
Police! Don't move!

03:30.311 --> 03:31.512
Show me your hands!

03:31.545 --> 03:33.514
(gunshot)

03:34.282 --> 03:35.849
Kevin, you all right?!

03:35.883 --> 03:37.451
Yeah, he took a shot at me.

03:38.519 --> 03:39.820
198, come in to Central.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.658
198, come in to Central.

03:44.692 --> 03:46.660
198, do you copy?

03:46.694 --> 03:47.695
FLACK:
So you're saying that after

03:47.728 --> 03:48.896
he popped off the one shot,

03:48.929 --> 03:50.731
he ditched the gun
and you called in a 13?

03:50.764 --> 03:52.666
That's not what I'm saying;
that's what happened.

03:52.700 --> 03:53.934
Okay.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.403
Central never heard your 13.

03:55.436 --> 03:57.371
Well, that must be
the first time

03:57.405 --> 03:58.439
that the radios didn't work.

03:58.472 --> 04:00.841
Did he have a gun in his
hand while he was running?

04:00.874 --> 04:02.443
No.

04:02.476 --> 04:03.243
And you saw him reaching

04:03.277 --> 04:04.912
into his pocket
when you shot him?

04:04.945 --> 04:07.381
He spun around, his hand was
up by his inside pocket.

04:07.415 --> 04:09.383
Which alley could he
have dumped the gun in?
I don't know.

04:09.417 --> 04:11.018
It was like a maze in there.

04:11.051 --> 04:14.522
Look, guys... detectives,

04:14.555 --> 04:17.358
I don't have
to talk to you.

04:17.391 --> 04:19.660
I have 48 hours
before I can be compelled

04:19.692 --> 04:23.297
to give a statement to IAB,
but I know what that looks like.

04:23.331 --> 04:27.535
You both think that gives me
48 hours to perfect my lie.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.470
I am not lying.

04:29.503 --> 04:32.306
That kid took a shot at me.

04:32.340 --> 04:34.041
I called a 13.

04:34.074 --> 04:36.043
(crowd clamoring outside)

04:37.911 --> 04:40.314
Stay there.

04:40.348 --> 04:41.715
Don't move!

04:45.886 --> 04:48.522
(clamoring)

04:52.660 --> 04:54.728
OFFICER:
10-13! One-two precinct.

04:54.762 --> 04:57.431
Disorderly group trying

04:57.465 --> 04:59.032
to forcibly enter
the precinct.

05:01.001 --> 05:03.604
(clamoring)

05:03.637 --> 05:05.673
(glass shattering)

05:31.665 --> 05:33.734
(clamoring continues)

05:35.636 --> 05:36.937
Get off of me!

05:57.725 --> 06:01.862
* Out here in the fields

06:01.895 --> 06:05.866
* I fight for my meals

06:05.899 --> 06:10.704
* I get my back into my living

06:12.906 --> 06:15.008
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:22.115 --> 06:24.452
(clamoring)

06:25.753 --> 06:28.021
REPORTER (over TV):
What began

06:28.055 --> 06:29.557
as a peaceful demonstration

06:29.590 --> 06:31.692
escalated into
a bloody confrontation

06:31.725 --> 06:33.727
this morning
inside this Manhattan precinct.

06:33.761 --> 06:36.730
Dozens of police officers
and civilians were injured.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.766
At least ten arrests

06:38.799 --> 06:41.569
were made, and it doesn't look
like the tension

06:41.602 --> 06:44.672
has come even close
to subsiding.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.608
(clamoring continues)

06:47.641 --> 06:50.978
The crowd out here has grown
to approximately 1,500,

06:51.011 --> 06:52.980
and no one is any closer

06:53.013 --> 06:55.048
to getting the answers
that they sought,

06:55.082 --> 06:57.718
particularly Tori Bell,
Timothy Brown's girlfriend,

06:57.751 --> 06:59.052
who is here with me now.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.821
Miss Bell, is there anything
you'd like to say?

07:00.854 --> 07:02.990
Tim didn't rob anybody.

07:03.023 --> 07:05.659
They're saying he
robbed a jewelry store,

07:05.693 --> 07:07.595
and I can't believe
he would do that.

07:07.628 --> 07:10.498
He wasn't a violent
person, and...

07:10.531 --> 07:13.867
I've never seen him raise
his hand towards anyone,

07:13.901 --> 07:16.169
let alone rob a jewelry store.

07:16.203 --> 07:19.740
He was a good man.

07:19.773 --> 07:23.043
I loved him
very much.

07:23.076 --> 07:25.813
I just want to know
what happened.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.781
The mope took a shot at him.

07:27.815 --> 07:28.916
That's what happened.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.552
You saw him take a shot
at Hopkins?

07:32.553 --> 07:34.187
No.

07:34.221 --> 07:35.188
You hear the shot?

07:35.222 --> 07:36.590
No.

07:36.624 --> 07:38.692
So how do you know

07:38.726 --> 07:40.227
that Brown took a shot
at Hopkins?

07:40.260 --> 07:42.896
Because Kevin said so,
and that's good enough for me.

07:42.930 --> 07:44.765
Well, that's not
good enough for me.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.067
And it's not good enough
for the bosses down at One P.P.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.769
Start from the beginning.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.103
Look, I already gave
my statement to IAB.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.271
Well, tell us.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.507
(scoffs)

07:55.643 --> 07:57.811
I can't believe
how out of control this got.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.680
All because some punk wants
to buy his jewelry

07:59.713 --> 08:02.015
by sticking a gun
in the owner's face.

08:02.049 --> 08:05.619
2,000 people out
there for this guy.

08:06.186 --> 08:08.656
They were tossing jewelry

08:08.689 --> 08:10.558
on the ground
while we were chasing them.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.693
LOVATO:
Did you see a gun

08:12.726 --> 08:14.762
in either one's hand
while they were running?
No.

08:14.795 --> 08:17.264
What happened after you
abandoned your vehicle?
They split up.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.733
I followed the one kid
down an alleyway to the left.

08:24.672 --> 08:26.807
Police!

08:26.840 --> 08:27.975
(generator whirring loudly)

08:28.008 --> 08:29.743
Stop!

08:29.777 --> 08:32.312
Sector Adam 841 to Central!

08:32.345 --> 08:34.847
Suspect has scaled
a barbed wire fence!

08:34.881 --> 08:36.717
Last seen heading eastbound
toward Lenox!

08:42.722 --> 08:44.658
That's when I doubled back
to find Hopkins.

08:44.692 --> 08:46.660
Had you heard a shot
at that point?

08:46.694 --> 08:48.295
No, but that doesn't mean
that it didn't happen.

08:48.328 --> 08:49.663
The generator in the alley

08:49.697 --> 08:50.731
was like standing
next to an airplane.

08:50.764 --> 08:53.867
So when did you hear the shot?
I was coming around

08:53.901 --> 08:56.069
one of the corners when...

08:56.103 --> 08:58.238
(gunshot)

08:58.271 --> 09:00.040
Kevin, you all right?!

09:00.073 --> 09:01.675
Yeah, he took a shot at me.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.778
DISPATCHER:
198, come in to Central.

09:08.882 --> 09:09.917
He had a gun.

09:12.720 --> 09:15.756
198, come in to Central.

09:18.626 --> 09:19.793
198, do you copy?

09:19.827 --> 09:22.763
He had a gun.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.306
(camera clicks, sirens wailing)

09:33.340 --> 09:35.342
*

10:04.037 --> 10:05.939
LOVATO:
What do you think?

10:05.973 --> 10:09.843
It would've been so easy for him
to cover for Hopkins and lie.

10:09.877 --> 10:11.044
All he would have to do

10:11.078 --> 10:12.179
is say that he heard two shots,

10:12.212 --> 10:14.181
and there would be nothing
we could do to dispute it.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.984
So you think the vic really did
take a shot at Hopkins?

10:17.017 --> 10:18.986
I think he thinks the vic
took a shot at Hopkins.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.921
But the truth is,

10:20.954 --> 10:22.823
no one knows what happened
in that alley

10:22.856 --> 10:24.858
except for Hopkins
and Timothy Brown.

10:24.892 --> 10:26.927
We need evidence.

10:38.205 --> 10:39.406
(cell phone ringing)

10:39.439 --> 10:41.441
Calling to tell me
you found the gun?

10:41.474 --> 10:43.376
Wish I had good news.
We've combed the alley,

10:43.410 --> 10:44.912
can't find anything.

10:44.945 --> 10:46.847
Dumpsters, doors, garbage bags?

10:46.880 --> 10:48.916
He could've tossed the gun
on a roof, maybe.

10:48.949 --> 10:50.851
Mac, there is no gun.

10:50.884 --> 10:51.852
What's the situation there?

10:51.885 --> 10:54.121
Do we have a lead on the perp
that got away?

10:54.154 --> 10:55.989
Not yet, and things are
definitely not quieting down.

10:56.023 --> 10:57.991
It's all over the news,

10:58.025 --> 10:59.993
and now half the community
is outside.

11:00.027 --> 11:01.929
There's maybe 1,500 people
out there.

11:01.962 --> 11:03.163
Maybe Sid's got something.

11:03.196 --> 11:04.397
Well, he better.

11:04.431 --> 11:08.936
We need something to tell us
whether or not Hopkins is lying.

11:28.088 --> 11:29.990
Sid.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.458
Hey, Mac, is everything
all right over there?

11:31.491 --> 11:33.994
Yeah, we're hanging in,
but it's gonna get ugly again

11:34.027 --> 11:37.264
if we can't provide
any satisfactory answers.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.066
Well, let's hope
what I'm about to tell you

11:39.099 --> 11:40.300
doesn't get leaked
to the press.

11:40.333 --> 11:41.334
You're with the body?

11:41.368 --> 11:43.503
I haven't started the autopsy,

11:43.536 --> 11:46.506
uh, but I performed
some preliminary examinations.

11:46.539 --> 11:50.978
That tox showed no alcohol
or drugs in the victim's system.

11:51.011 --> 11:54.948
But more importantly,
Timothy Brown's hands

11:54.982 --> 11:57.851
tested negative
for gunshot residue.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.955
Did Jo find
any ballistic evidence

12:01.989 --> 12:03.323
at the crime scene?

12:03.356 --> 12:04.825
No.

12:04.858 --> 12:07.360
Hopkins is lying about the gun.

12:14.267 --> 12:17.838
(chanting): We want the truth!
We want the truth!

12:17.871 --> 12:20.073
We want the truth! We want...

12:20.107 --> 12:22.342
No, no GSR on the vic.

12:22.375 --> 12:25.078
I think that's the wrong call.

12:25.112 --> 12:27.514
Respectfully, sir,
I think locking him up

12:27.547 --> 12:30.984
and letting the grand jury
sort it out is a cop-out.

12:31.018 --> 12:33.553
I-I realize the political
implications of this,

12:33.586 --> 12:35.322
but we deserve more time,

12:35.355 --> 12:39.226
and Hopkins deserves better
than punting to the grand jury.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.032
I understand.

12:45.065 --> 12:46.499
Whatever you say, Chief.

12:46.533 --> 12:48.301
REPORTER (on TV):
Officers and detectives

12:48.335 --> 12:50.537
are more or less
barricaded inside,

12:50.570 --> 12:54.141
as demonstrators have virtually
surrounded the precinct.

12:54.174 --> 12:57.510
Officials within the NYPD
are not releasing the names

12:57.544 --> 13:00.147
of the officers involved
in the shooting,

13:00.180 --> 13:04.084
but we have learned that
they are officers Kevin Hopkins

13:04.117 --> 13:05.018
and Trey Jensen.

13:05.052 --> 13:07.988
Might as well hang
wanted posters outside.

13:08.021 --> 13:12.092
Officer Hopkins, a member of
the NYPD for the last two years,

13:12.125 --> 13:13.861
has been brought before

13:13.894 --> 13:16.964
the Civilian Complaint
Review Board in the past.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.398
Oh, come on, Victoria!

13:18.431 --> 13:19.599
You know about that?

13:19.632 --> 13:22.202
Yeah, he responded to a 911 call
of a domestic disturbance.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.571
A wife wanted her husband locked
up for hiding her cigarettes.

13:24.604 --> 13:26.573
Hopkins asked the husband
to hide her phone, too.

13:26.606 --> 13:28.141
The complaint was dismissed.

13:28.175 --> 13:30.911
...ahold of both of
the officers' personnel files...

13:30.944 --> 13:31.912
(turns off TV)

13:31.945 --> 13:34.147
What's the chief say?

13:34.181 --> 13:36.583
It's not just Sinclair, it's
the mayor and the D.A., too.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.919
This thing spun out of control,
so they're saying,

13:38.952 --> 13:41.221
"Just lock 'em up.
Let the grand jury sort it out."

13:41.254 --> 13:42.222
You satisfied with that?

13:42.255 --> 13:44.925
Not at all.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.399
You want to tell me
what's going on?

13:52.432 --> 13:55.435
I'll tell you what's going on
when you stop lying to me.

13:55.468 --> 13:56.970
What's that supposed to mean?

13:57.004 --> 13:59.139
Timothy Brown didn't have a gun.

14:00.473 --> 14:01.875
No gun. No ballistics.

14:01.909 --> 14:02.842
We've been over this

14:02.876 --> 14:05.045
a hundred times.
I came around the corner...

14:05.078 --> 14:08.015
He didn't have gunshot residue
on his hands or his jacket.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.216
Nothing, not a speck.

14:09.249 --> 14:11.151
You want to tell me
how that happens?

14:13.020 --> 14:16.089
See, the thing is,
you didn't have to lie.

14:16.123 --> 14:18.025
You didn't need it.

14:18.058 --> 14:21.194
Here's what I
think happened.

14:21.228 --> 14:24.297
You chased a guy who just
robbed a jewelry store.

14:24.331 --> 14:26.299
You came around the corner,
you identified yourself

14:26.333 --> 14:27.334
as a police officer,

14:27.367 --> 14:29.903
he disobeyed
your command,

14:29.937 --> 14:33.306
he spun around with his hand
up by his chest, and you fired.

14:33.340 --> 14:37.044
You did everything right.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.546
The truth would've been enough;
the truth is enough.

14:39.579 --> 14:42.182
But you thought it
wouldn't look good,

14:42.215 --> 14:45.352
so you had to say
he fired at you.

14:45.385 --> 14:48.055
You're a good police
officer, Kevin,

14:48.088 --> 14:50.357
but you got to stop
lying to me.

14:50.390 --> 14:54.161
Detective Taylor, I respect you,

14:54.194 --> 14:57.965
I got respect for you,
but screw you.

14:57.998 --> 15:00.033
That kid,

15:00.067 --> 15:02.135
he pointed a gun
and he shot at me,

15:02.169 --> 15:05.072
and I will go to my grave
swearing by that.

15:05.105 --> 15:06.940
Take me out there.

15:06.974 --> 15:09.509
I will... I will
walk you through it.

15:20.320 --> 15:23.256
It's too dangerous
to bring you out there.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.360
But we can
bring the scene to you.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.332
ROSS:
There's no way I'm chasing a guy

15:32.365 --> 15:35.135
who may or may not have a gun
down this alley.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.170
HAWKES: When's the last time
you chased anyone at all?

15:37.204 --> 15:39.172
HOPKINS (over earpiece):
I think he went right.

15:39.206 --> 15:40.240
Hawkes, take a right

15:40.273 --> 15:41.574
at the end of this tunnel.

15:41.608 --> 15:44.144
10-4, Mac.

15:51.151 --> 15:53.987
Are you sure
he went right?

15:56.523 --> 15:58.491
Yeah, he definitely went right.

16:03.396 --> 16:04.597
Is this where
he took the shot?

16:04.631 --> 16:08.268
No. No, it wasn't right
out of the dark alley.

16:08.301 --> 16:09.369
Keep going down.

16:12.572 --> 16:15.075
You sure?

16:15.108 --> 16:16.243
Yeah.

16:16.276 --> 16:17.644
Yeah, it was,

16:17.677 --> 16:19.246
it was more narrow and...

16:19.279 --> 16:22.215
198 in pursuit down
the alley behind...

16:22.249 --> 16:24.251
There was, there was
fire escapes.

16:24.284 --> 16:26.253
It was more narrow.
There was fire escapes.

16:31.191 --> 16:33.326
Hang on.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.662
TAYLOR:
Adam, stay there for a sec.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.301
Is this it?

16:41.334 --> 16:42.269
I think so.

16:42.302 --> 16:43.770
I'm not sure.

16:45.472 --> 16:48.141
Yeah.

16:48.175 --> 16:50.243
That is the corner.
I remember, I took cover.

16:50.277 --> 16:52.412
I was leaning
right against that wall.

16:52.445 --> 16:55.215
(gunshot)

16:55.248 --> 16:56.249
10-13, 10-13!

16:56.283 --> 16:58.017
Shot's fired!

17:00.820 --> 17:04.391
Mac, got an impact mark
on this pipe here.

17:05.791 --> 17:07.227
(sighs)

17:07.260 --> 17:09.561
Adam, can you zoom in?

17:09.596 --> 17:11.298
(camera whirring)

17:11.330 --> 17:14.233
Hawkes, if Timothy Brown was
standing in that alley

17:14.267 --> 17:15.402
when he took the shot,

17:15.435 --> 17:17.537
there's got to be a casing.

17:17.569 --> 17:18.738
All right.

17:18.771 --> 17:20.640
Just tell me when to stop.

17:22.642 --> 17:24.277
Right about there.

17:24.310 --> 17:26.313
He was standing right there
in the center.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.473
*

18:02.615 --> 18:04.184
(sighs)

18:07.754 --> 18:09.622
You still think I'm lying?

18:11.758 --> 18:13.426
(clamoring)

18:13.460 --> 18:15.362
We want justice!
We want justice!

18:15.395 --> 18:18.398
No, Hawkes, go straight back
to the lab and get that casing

18:18.431 --> 18:19.332
into Brass Catcher.

18:19.366 --> 18:21.134
Maybe we can connect this
to Timothy Brown

18:21.168 --> 18:22.235
or anyone else he runs with.

18:22.269 --> 18:23.303
This is gonna get ugly again.

18:23.336 --> 18:26.139
And I don't care how many
reinforcements we call in,

18:26.173 --> 18:28.241
if they want to get in,
they're getting in.

18:28.275 --> 18:29.242
(banging on windows)

18:29.276 --> 18:32.312
We got to get Hopkins
and Jensen out of here.

18:32.345 --> 18:34.514
I'm with you on that,
but they're not going out

18:34.547 --> 18:35.382
through those doors.

18:35.415 --> 18:37.417
So, if you have any ideas,
I'm all ears.

18:39.386 --> 18:41.721
Those ambulances are still
out back by the dock.

18:41.754 --> 18:43.656
(crowd clamoring)

18:45.858 --> 18:47.227
(chanting):
...no peace!

18:47.260 --> 18:49.262
No justice, no peace!

18:49.296 --> 18:52.365
No justice,
no peace!

18:52.399 --> 18:54.734
(siren whooping, horn honking)

18:56.369 --> 18:59.339
(chanting continues)

19:07.580 --> 19:09.516
(clamoring)

19:16.523 --> 19:17.524
MAN:
We need help!

19:17.557 --> 19:19.392
Dispatch, get some
cops out here!

19:19.426 --> 19:21.394
(chanting, clamoring continue)

19:29.469 --> 19:32.739
Yo, that's one of them!
That's one of the guys!

19:32.772 --> 19:34.841
(clamoring)

19:37.477 --> 19:39.646
Help me! Hey! Hey!

19:46.319 --> 19:48.688
(crowd clamoring)

19:52.692 --> 19:53.960
(grunts)

20:00.400 --> 20:02.335
MAN: Move out of the way!
Let the police through!

20:02.369 --> 20:05.272
(rhythmic banging on shields)

20:11.811 --> 20:13.413
Get off me!

20:16.549 --> 20:17.550
Come on!

20:19.752 --> 20:21.554
You all right?
I am now.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.490
(glass shatters)

20:23.523 --> 20:25.292
Let's get the hell out of
here! Let's go! Let's go!

20:25.325 --> 20:28.227
(clamoring continues)

20:43.643 --> 20:45.812
*

21:00.993 --> 21:02.562
Match.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.939
Lord, tell me you
found something.

21:12.972 --> 21:14.607
I've got two somethings.

21:14.641 --> 21:15.875
Two matches in Brass Catcher

21:15.908 --> 21:18.711
to the shell casings
recovered in the alley.

21:18.745 --> 21:21.514
Two different shootings,
six weeks apart.

21:21.548 --> 21:24.617
Both in the 6-4,
both in the vicinity of Avenue Q

21:24.651 --> 21:25.852
and 12th street.

21:25.885 --> 21:27.687
The most recent,
December of last year.

21:27.720 --> 21:28.855
Now, no arrests

21:28.888 --> 21:30.990
in either case,
but I'm not so sure

21:31.023 --> 21:32.792
they're connected
to the jewelry store robbery.

21:32.825 --> 21:35.094
122nd Street in
Manhattan is a long way

21:35.127 --> 21:36.629
from Avenue Q
in Brooklyn.

21:36.663 --> 21:38.665
Yeah.
But it may not be
as far as we think.

21:38.698 --> 21:40.333
That jacket that
belonged to the perp

21:40.367 --> 21:41.601
who went over the
barbed wire fence

21:41.634 --> 21:42.969
that Danny processed--

21:43.002 --> 21:45.605
turns out, it had a hole
in the pocket.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.006
He found a piece of paper

21:47.039 --> 21:48.441
inside the lining
of the jacket.

21:48.475 --> 21:49.609
It had been washed a few times.

21:49.642 --> 21:52.945
Turns out, it was a summons
issued a few months ago

21:52.979 --> 21:55.748
in the 64th Precinct
for drinking alcohol

21:55.782 --> 21:58.017
in an open container
in public.

22:02.855 --> 22:06.659
That was the 4300
block of Avenue Q.

22:06.693 --> 22:09.596
Right up the block from these
two unsolved shootings.

22:09.629 --> 22:11.030
So that connects
our guy who jumped

22:11.063 --> 22:12.565
over the barbed wire fence
to the neighborhood

22:12.599 --> 22:14.434
where the shootings occurred.

22:14.467 --> 22:17.036
Avenue Q and 12th is a
residential neighborhood.

22:17.069 --> 22:20.373
So that drinking summons tells
me this is where they hang out,

22:20.407 --> 22:22.575
and that's where we
need to be looking.

22:22.609 --> 22:24.811
Yeah, but we don't have Jensen
or Hopkins to put into a car

22:24.844 --> 22:28.147
to do an area search, and the
jewelry store owner can't I.D.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.650
There were no cameras in the
jewelry store, and we don't have

22:30.683 --> 22:33.386
a good screen shot from the
dash cam in the squad car.

22:33.420 --> 22:35.555
So we don't know who the
hell we're looking for.

22:35.588 --> 22:37.590
(computer beeping)

22:42.595 --> 22:43.696
How's Hopkins?

22:43.730 --> 22:45.565
He got roughed up pretty good.

22:45.598 --> 22:47.634
But he's okay;
could've been worse.

22:47.667 --> 22:48.935
Any sign of the
protest letting up?

22:48.968 --> 22:52.539
None. Crowds have
actually gotten bigger.

22:52.572 --> 22:54.507
Commissioner called
a Level 2 mobilization.

22:54.541 --> 22:55.842
More reinforcements are
on the way.

22:55.875 --> 22:58.411
The only way
this thing is gonna die down

22:58.445 --> 23:00.480
is if we get some more answers.

23:00.513 --> 23:02.148
We need that other guy
in the alley

23:02.181 --> 23:03.783
with Hopkins and Jensen.

23:03.816 --> 23:05.785
The shell casing--
did it get us anything?

23:05.818 --> 23:07.520
It got us to a neighborhood
where one of

23:07.554 --> 23:08.555
our jewelry store perps
might hang.

23:08.588 --> 23:10.189
DANVILLE:
The problem is,

23:10.222 --> 23:12.825
Mac, we need a photo
or a witness who can I.D.

23:12.859 --> 23:14.727
Jensen made it out of here
before they got Hopkins.

23:14.761 --> 23:16.128
He's at headquarters.

23:16.162 --> 23:17.864
He got a look at the guy
who went over the fence.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.732
Put him in a car
and get out there.

23:19.766 --> 23:21.601
Come on, finding them
hanging out in the streets

23:21.634 --> 23:23.002
seems like a long shot.

23:23.035 --> 23:24.871
You might be right,
but right now,

23:24.904 --> 23:26.839
it's the only
good lead we've got.

23:28.841 --> 23:31.478
REPORTER:
Tonight's top story continues
to be the community unrest

23:31.511 --> 23:33.546
outside the 12th Street
Precinct in Manhattan

23:33.580 --> 23:36.148
over the alleged shooting
of an unarmed man by police.

23:36.182 --> 23:38.050
The mayor and police
commissioner continue to call

23:38.084 --> 23:41.521
for calm, but protesters
remain defiant.

23:41.554 --> 23:42.689
Some in the community
are labeling the death

23:42.722 --> 23:44.824
of Timothy Brown
a cold-blooded murder.

23:44.857 --> 23:46.726
JENSEN:
Any of those jackass
reporters that talk

23:46.759 --> 23:48.861
to Kevin Hopkins for
five minutes-- they'd realize

23:48.895 --> 23:50.229
how ridiculous
that statement is.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.732
WOMAN (over radio):
...one of the two police
officers involved...

23:52.765 --> 23:53.733
DANVILLE:
Recognize anybody?

23:53.766 --> 23:56.803
...Officer Kevin Hopkins
shot the 26-year-old...

23:56.836 --> 23:58.571
What you looking at?

23:58.605 --> 23:59.572
Nope.

23:59.606 --> 24:01.508
None of them are the guys
we were chasing down

24:01.541 --> 24:02.542
to murder in cold blood.

24:04.076 --> 24:06.813
The other unidentified
suspect remains at large.

24:06.846 --> 24:07.980
Yeah.

24:08.014 --> 24:09.649
All right, be safe.

24:09.682 --> 24:11.083
(clamoring continues outside)

24:11.117 --> 24:13.720
No luck yet on the perp
who went over the fence,

24:13.753 --> 24:15.187
but they're still looking.

24:15.221 --> 24:18.558
Boss, I don't want to tell you
how to conduct your business,

24:18.591 --> 24:20.560
but you got to answer
your phone.

24:20.593 --> 24:21.528
Okay? Your voicemail's
all jacked up,

24:21.561 --> 24:23.730
Jo doesn't pick up her phone--
I was literally

24:23.763 --> 24:25.131
left unsupervised
for a really long time.

24:25.164 --> 24:26.132
Adam, what's going on?

24:26.165 --> 24:28.768
How the hell did you get
past that mob outside?

24:28.801 --> 24:31.604
Well, I-I parked my car, like,
20 blocks away and I walked.

24:31.638 --> 24:33.773
And I'm not gonna lie, I almost
got jacked a couple times,

24:33.806 --> 24:35.107
but as long as I, you know,

24:35.141 --> 24:36.776
pumped my fist up
in the air and yelled

24:36.809 --> 24:38.578
some crazy things
and kicked over a garbage can,

24:38.611 --> 24:39.979
I was... I was good,
I was totally good.

24:40.012 --> 24:41.714
Okay, what's so important?

24:41.748 --> 24:43.149
The jewelry

24:43.182 --> 24:45.752
that we found
in Timothy Brown's pocket--

24:45.785 --> 24:47.119
okay, we all assumed
that it was

24:47.153 --> 24:49.556
part of the robbery, right?

24:49.589 --> 24:51.824
Now, a lot of it was stamped

24:51.858 --> 24:53.760
14-karat gold, and I'm really
good with my precious metals,

24:53.793 --> 24:55.227
so some of it
didn't look right,

24:55.261 --> 24:56.829
so I tested some of
the heavier-gauge bracelets.

24:56.863 --> 24:59.298
Turns out,
it was 14-karat iron.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.033
It dissolved
in hydrochloric acid

25:01.067 --> 25:02.569
and had a phony gold stamp.

25:02.602 --> 25:03.836
Worthless.

25:03.870 --> 25:05.838
Right? So I went back
out in the field

25:05.872 --> 25:07.907
and I... and I did
some more legwork,

25:07.940 --> 25:09.676
and I really hope
that that's okay.

25:09.709 --> 25:11.243
Yeah, it's fine. Go on.

25:11.277 --> 25:13.813
The jewelry belonged
to Brown, Mac.

25:13.846 --> 25:15.982
All right? He was trying to
hock it at another jewelry store

25:16.015 --> 25:18.117
about a block away
from the one that got robbed.

25:18.150 --> 25:20.252
He was just trying to scrape
in a couple extra bucks

25:20.286 --> 25:22.288
together to get this.

25:23.790 --> 25:25.157
It's an engagement ring.

25:25.191 --> 25:27.159
He was gonna propose
to his girl.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.961
Now, I tracked
down the store

25:28.995 --> 25:30.597
through the serial number
of the diamond,

25:30.630 --> 25:32.632
and I spoke to the owner.

25:32.665 --> 25:33.733
Timothy Brown was in there

25:33.766 --> 25:36.736
around the same time
that the other store got hit.

25:36.769 --> 25:38.170
Mac,

25:38.204 --> 25:40.940
Timothy Brown had nothing
to do with the robbery.

25:40.973 --> 25:43.610
Both those perps
are still out there.

25:43.643 --> 25:44.844
DISPATCHER:
All units, be advised,

25:44.877 --> 25:47.146
the 12th Squad is seeking
two males in connection with

25:47.179 --> 25:48.848
the jewelry store robbery
earlier today.

25:48.881 --> 25:51.684
They are two male blacks,
20 to 25 years old,

25:51.718 --> 25:53.786
one wearing a black ski jacket
and blue jeans,

25:53.820 --> 25:56.188
the other in a gray hoodie
and blue jeans.

25:56.222 --> 25:58.057
These males are known to
frequent the 4300 block

25:58.090 --> 25:59.892
of Avenue Q in Brooklyn.

25:59.926 --> 26:01.928
(indistinct chatter)

26:08.635 --> 26:09.936
JENSEN:
That's him.

26:09.969 --> 26:12.104
That's the guy
that went over the fence.

26:14.907 --> 26:17.209
Whoa, the guy in the
black ski jacket.

26:17.243 --> 26:18.811
He's the guy
Hopkins was chasing.

26:20.947 --> 26:22.749
DANNY: Jensen, stay put.
MAN: Go, go, go!

26:23.816 --> 26:25.351
(siren wailing)

26:32.959 --> 26:34.761
(grunting)

26:40.867 --> 26:42.935
(grunts)

26:48.207 --> 26:49.876
Hey, NYPD!

26:49.909 --> 26:51.878
Come out right now with
your hands above your head!

26:51.911 --> 26:53.279
Turn around!
Show me your hands!

26:55.147 --> 26:56.949
Hands up!

27:11.764 --> 27:13.132
Everybody okay?

27:13.165 --> 27:14.901
DANNY:
Yeah, everybody but him.

27:18.037 --> 27:19.038
There's no gun.

27:20.072 --> 27:21.974
Did you see a gun?

27:22.008 --> 27:26.112
No, b-but I saw him reaching
for something in that mailbox.

27:48.034 --> 27:50.402
(sniffs)

27:50.436 --> 27:52.104
Come on, Ray, pull
yourself together.

27:52.138 --> 27:53.105
We're almost done.

27:53.139 --> 27:55.174
Look, I'm trying, man.

27:56.208 --> 27:58.344
That was my homeboy
you guys killed.

27:58.377 --> 28:00.913
Yeah, well, he made
a bad choice, Ray.

28:00.947 --> 28:02.749
He went for that gun.

28:02.782 --> 28:03.950
After Keith came home
from upstate,

28:03.983 --> 28:07.119
he said, "I'm never
going back to jail."

28:07.153 --> 28:09.822
I guess he wasn't lying.

28:09.856 --> 28:11.991
That gun has been

28:12.024 --> 28:13.292
around the block a few times.

28:13.325 --> 28:14.827
Two shootings in Brooklyn.

28:14.861 --> 28:16.262
And then the jewelry
store robbery today.

28:16.295 --> 28:17.496
Who does it belong to?

28:17.529 --> 28:20.733
It belonged to everybody.

28:20.767 --> 28:23.202
That gun always in that mailbox.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.272
It's like...

28:26.305 --> 28:28.007
going to the library
or something.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.441
Taking out a book.

28:29.475 --> 28:31.878
You go in there, you take it,
you need it, you use it,

28:31.911 --> 28:33.512
you put it back, that's it--
it's the honor system.

28:33.545 --> 28:34.513
So earlier today,

28:34.546 --> 28:37.283
you and Keith checked out a gun

28:37.316 --> 28:39.085
and then used it to hold up
a jewelry store?

28:39.118 --> 28:40.920
Look, I told you
before, okay?

28:40.953 --> 28:41.854
We wasn't meaning to use it.

28:41.888 --> 28:43.823
We was gonna front
on those people in case

28:43.856 --> 28:44.957
they got bold or something.

28:44.991 --> 28:46.158
And then maybe

28:46.192 --> 28:49.495
shoot a few cops if they were
bold enough to chase you?

28:49.528 --> 28:50.930
Nah, I wasn't trying
to kill that cop.

28:50.963 --> 28:52.231
I was just trying to shoot him.

28:53.299 --> 28:55.768
You were just trying
to shoot him?

28:58.170 --> 29:00.306
HOPKINS:
...in the alley behind, uh...

29:00.339 --> 29:02.308
JENSEN (over radio):
Uh, negative! I'm doubling back!

29:02.341 --> 29:03.142
(gunshot)

29:03.175 --> 29:04.743
10-13! Shots fired!

29:14.120 --> 29:16.022
That place was
all tore up like it was

29:16.055 --> 29:17.289
out of business or something.

29:17.323 --> 29:19.058
I hit the streets,
ditched into the subway,

29:19.091 --> 29:21.427
and hopped a train
back to Brooklyn, that's it.

29:21.460 --> 29:25.064
We did that stickup,
but we didn't hurt nobody.

29:26.098 --> 29:29.068
You hurt so many people.

29:39.145 --> 29:41.147
Thank you for coming.

29:46.018 --> 29:48.287
Still can't believe Tim's dead.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.589
This is crazy.

29:50.622 --> 29:54.126
All those people out there
fighting the police,

29:54.160 --> 29:55.494
demanding justice for Tim.

29:55.527 --> 29:56.896
They're looking for

29:56.929 --> 30:00.132
what we've been
looking for: answers.

30:00.166 --> 30:01.467
Do you have any?

30:01.500 --> 30:03.002
That's why I
asked you here.

30:05.204 --> 30:08.407
I want you to
hear the truth.

30:08.440 --> 30:11.043
Before you read some
version of it in the papers

30:11.077 --> 30:12.344
or hear it
on the news.

30:12.378 --> 30:16.215
I... I want
to understand, Detective.

30:16.248 --> 30:18.517
Really, I do.

30:18.550 --> 30:20.853
But there is

30:20.887 --> 30:25.057
nothing you can say to me
that'll change anything.

30:25.091 --> 30:26.959
I mean...

30:28.961 --> 30:32.498
How could that cop
just murder Tim like that?

30:32.531 --> 30:34.533
(sighs)

30:36.602 --> 30:38.370
Take a walk with me?

30:46.946 --> 30:50.516
If I could step in front
of that bullet to save that man,

30:50.549 --> 30:52.451
I swear to God I would do it.

30:52.484 --> 30:55.287
That would feel
better than this.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.892
I was scared, Detective.

31:01.961 --> 31:04.363
I was shaking all over.

31:04.396 --> 31:08.234
Like a coward.

31:08.267 --> 31:10.369
And maybe if I just...

31:10.402 --> 31:13.940
kept my cool,
I would've hesitated.

31:13.973 --> 31:16.108
I would've seen he had no gun.

31:18.110 --> 31:19.611
That he was the wrong guy.

31:19.645 --> 31:21.480
And what if it was
the right guy?

31:21.513 --> 31:23.950
And he had a gun.

31:25.952 --> 31:29.021
Then maybe it's you
lying in that alley.

31:31.623 --> 31:33.592
That's the nature of
this job, Hopkins.

31:33.625 --> 31:36.128
There's no do-overs.

31:36.162 --> 31:38.397
You're forced to make
the best decision

31:38.430 --> 31:40.466
given the circumstances,
and you better make it fast.

31:40.499 --> 31:42.068
That's what
you're trained to do.

31:42.101 --> 31:43.169
That's what you did.

31:45.071 --> 31:46.405
Let me tell
you something.

31:46.438 --> 31:50.476
A coward doesn't run
after an armed man

31:50.509 --> 31:53.645
who's trying to kill him.

31:53.679 --> 31:55.447
A coward runs away.

31:57.216 --> 31:59.218
But that kid is dead now.

32:01.220 --> 32:03.622
And he didn't do
a damn thing wrong.

32:06.158 --> 32:09.428
And his family...

32:09.461 --> 32:11.463
and his girl...

32:16.235 --> 32:18.237
...what do I say to them?

32:19.305 --> 32:21.307
You can feel
bad about that.

32:24.243 --> 32:27.579
If you didn't, I'd think
you didn't have conscience.

32:42.594 --> 32:44.496
(door opens)

32:44.530 --> 32:46.565
That kid's dead

32:46.598 --> 32:49.601
because two sons of bitches
decided to rob a jewelry store.

32:49.635 --> 32:52.438
Simple as that.

32:54.173 --> 32:56.575
TAYLOR:
At the very same moment
our suspect was

32:56.608 --> 32:59.511
disappearing through the
back door of the theater...

33:01.513 --> 33:02.748
...Tim

33:02.781 --> 33:04.716
appeared in the alley

33:04.750 --> 33:07.386
coming from
the opposite direction.

33:07.419 --> 33:09.321
I'm not asking you

33:09.355 --> 33:12.124
to excuse what happened,
I just want you

33:12.158 --> 33:13.525
to understand why.

33:13.559 --> 33:15.194
TORI:
I get it.

33:15.227 --> 33:18.030
They were wearing
the same clothes,

33:18.064 --> 33:22.301
they had the same color skin.

33:22.334 --> 33:25.637
That... cop thought that Tim

33:25.671 --> 33:28.140
was the one shooting at him.

33:30.209 --> 33:33.279
It was wrong.

33:33.312 --> 33:36.682
He made a mistake, he...

33:36.715 --> 33:39.251
killed the wrong man.

33:39.285 --> 33:41.353
Yes, he did.

33:44.356 --> 33:46.425
An innocent man, a good man.

33:50.496 --> 33:54.066
And he'll have to live with
the burden of that mistake

33:54.100 --> 33:55.601
for the rest of his life.

33:59.138 --> 34:03.409
I'm sorry there was
no easy way to do this, but...

34:03.442 --> 34:05.344
I thought you should know.

34:07.613 --> 34:10.382
Tim had this
in his pocket.

34:10.416 --> 34:13.319
He was planning
to give it to you.

34:24.795 --> 34:27.199
"Today is life."

34:30.636 --> 34:34.440
"The only life you're sure of.

34:34.473 --> 34:36.408
Make the most of today."

34:38.744 --> 34:42.447
That's how Tim signed off
all his letters to me

34:42.481 --> 34:44.483
when he was away at college.

34:47.353 --> 34:49.420
Seems kind of prophetic now.

35:00.366 --> 35:03.269
I'm sorry.

35:09.508 --> 35:10.576
Miss Bell.

35:12.578 --> 35:14.546
Uh, no.

35:14.580 --> 35:17.149
Please.

35:18.484 --> 35:21.187
Only remind me
of what could have been.

35:43.942 --> 35:45.444
VICTORIA:
The numbers have not diminished,

35:45.477 --> 35:47.279
but the intensity of the protest

35:47.313 --> 35:48.614
seems to have waned
for the moment,

35:48.647 --> 35:51.283
after word that the mayor
has agreed to meet

35:51.317 --> 35:52.518
with community leaders

35:52.551 --> 35:55.654
and answer questions regarding
the death of Timothy Brown.

35:55.687 --> 35:58.524
Brown's longtime girlfriend,
Tori Bell,

35:58.557 --> 36:01.460
was summoned to the precinct
a short time ago by police,

36:01.493 --> 36:02.928
leading to speculation...

36:02.961 --> 36:04.230
MAN: There she is!
There she is!

36:04.263 --> 36:05.297
VICTORIA:
H-Hold on.

36:05.331 --> 36:06.898
It appears Miss Bell is emerging
from the precinct.

36:06.932 --> 36:08.667
REPORTER:
Tori, do you blame Hopkins?

36:08.700 --> 36:10.636
REPORTER 2:
Tori, are they making excuses...

36:10.669 --> 36:12.538
(reporters clamoring)

36:15.474 --> 36:17.276
Do you want Officer
Hopkins to go to jail?

36:17.309 --> 36:18.877
Miss Bell,
what are police saying?

36:18.910 --> 36:20.579
REPORTER: What
can you tell us?

36:20.612 --> 36:22.414
(crowd quiets)

36:22.448 --> 36:23.649
Uh...

36:23.682 --> 36:25.651
I can tell you that

36:25.684 --> 36:29.388
today is the worst day
of my life.

36:29.421 --> 36:32.458
It's the worst day in the lives
of Timothy's family

36:32.491 --> 36:35.561
and the people who loved him.

36:35.594 --> 36:39.565
But it's also the worst day
in the life of Officer Hopkins.

36:39.598 --> 36:41.400
(crowd murmurs angrily)
Hold on.

36:41.433 --> 36:44.270
Please.

36:44.303 --> 36:45.637
All of this has to stop.

36:45.671 --> 36:47.739
(crowd quiets)

36:47.773 --> 36:52.411
That officer
didn't wake up this morning,

36:52.444 --> 36:55.547
go to work
and set out to kill Tim.

36:57.616 --> 37:02.588
That happened because two men
woke up this morning

37:02.621 --> 37:05.491
and decided that they were gonna
come to this neighborhood

37:05.524 --> 37:09.361
and steal what doesn't
belong to them.

37:09.395 --> 37:12.598
They tried to take
that policeman's life

37:12.631 --> 37:15.367
while he was protecting ours.

37:17.403 --> 37:19.505
And I hope...

37:19.538 --> 37:22.474
someday that maybe
I can find a way

37:22.508 --> 37:24.610
to forgive Officer Hopkins.

37:26.645 --> 37:30.749
But I will never forgive
those two men

37:30.782 --> 37:33.852
that came here with a gun.

37:33.885 --> 37:36.021
Because their actions

37:36.054 --> 37:39.658
took something from me
a hundred times more valuable

37:39.691 --> 37:42.628
than all of the jewelry
in that store.

37:44.630 --> 37:47.566
They stole the love of my life.

37:47.599 --> 37:49.601
*

38:03.014 --> 38:06.852
TAYLOR: As police officers
in this big, complicated city,

38:06.885 --> 38:09.355
we see so much bad.

38:09.388 --> 38:12.391
So many souls filled
with hatred and violence.

38:12.424 --> 38:14.593
And it's our job
to look for them,

38:14.626 --> 38:16.528
chase after them
and confront them.

38:16.562 --> 38:19.831
(siren wailing)

38:19.865 --> 38:22.634
Over time, they can
become all we see.

38:22.668 --> 38:24.703
As with all evil,

38:24.736 --> 38:27.706
some good will
always come from it.

38:30.041 --> 38:33.645
It can bring us together with
some of the most dedicated,

38:33.679 --> 38:35.647
honorable,
kind-hearted people

38:35.681 --> 38:37.849
we could ever hope to meet.

38:37.883 --> 38:42.120
It can fill hearts
with a love so strong

38:42.153 --> 38:44.656
that it will endure forever...

38:46.892 --> 38:49.961
...and create
unbreakable friendships

38:49.995 --> 38:53.031
that will last
even in the face of life's

38:53.064 --> 38:55.534
most difficult challenges.

39:07.112 --> 39:08.680
(laughs)

39:09.748 --> 39:12.684
Cheers, everybody.

39:12.718 --> 39:14.586
ALL:
Cheers.

39:32.771 --> 39:36.475
TAYLOR: Sometimes, the good
comes when we most need it

39:36.508 --> 39:38.477
and least expect it.

39:38.510 --> 39:40.812
If we are lucky enough
to notice it,

39:40.846 --> 39:43.649
set our eyes upon it
and appreciate it,

39:43.682 --> 39:46.852
it can almost make us forget
all of the bad.

39:49.220 --> 39:51.590
"Today is life.

39:51.623 --> 39:54.860
"The only life you're sure of.

39:54.893 --> 39:56.895
Make the most of today."

39:56.928 --> 39:59.498
Words of wisdom.

39:59.531 --> 40:02.668
A slice of goodness
passed on by an innocent soul

40:02.701 --> 40:05.170
whose life was cut short
by an errant bullet.

40:07.172 --> 40:09.841
These are words that will
always stay with me,

40:09.875 --> 40:13.812
words that are about to change
the course of my life forever.

40:15.747 --> 40:16.948
(sighs)

40:16.982 --> 40:20.719
This is not how I
imagined it would happen.

40:20.752 --> 40:21.987
I-I don't know if

40:22.020 --> 40:24.723
it's how you imagined
it would happen, or...

40:24.756 --> 40:27.559
if you even imagined it
happening at all, but...

40:29.595 --> 40:31.630
I'm not sure what you're saying.

40:31.663 --> 40:33.632
L-Let's go in
and have a glass of wine.

40:33.665 --> 40:34.633
I'll make a fire...
No.

40:34.666 --> 40:36.668
No, no, no,
stay here.

40:36.702 --> 40:38.670
I don't want to wait
another minute.

40:43.675 --> 40:45.544
I don't have a ring.

40:46.578 --> 40:48.046
Or a speech.

40:48.079 --> 40:50.682
I-I wasn't
even able to

40:50.716 --> 40:53.719
stop and pick up a cheap
bottle of champagne.

40:53.752 --> 40:55.987
(gasps softly)

41:01.760 --> 41:06.097
I never thought I'd
feel like this again.

41:09.568 --> 41:12.003
You're everything
that's good in my life.

41:17.008 --> 41:18.143
(sighs)

41:18.176 --> 41:19.711
We've been through
so much together.

41:19.745 --> 41:22.881
I need you, Christine,
I want you and I...

41:22.914 --> 41:24.883
I can't imagine my
life without you.

41:24.916 --> 41:26.785
I don't want to...

41:26.818 --> 41:28.086
(sighs)

41:28.119 --> 41:31.790
I just want to spend the rest
of my life with you by my side.

41:38.096 --> 41:39.798
Oh.

41:39.831 --> 41:41.833
Christine...

41:44.069 --> 41:46.905
...will you marry me?

41:48.774 --> 41:50.842
Yes.

41:50.876 --> 41:53.879
Of course I will.

41:54.913 --> 41:55.914
(laughs)

41:57.849 --> 41:59.818
(laughs):
Oh.

41:59.851 --> 42:03.689
This is exactly
how I imagined it.
