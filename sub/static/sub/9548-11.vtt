00:30.033 --> 00:32.947
What happened, are you okay?
What's wrong?

00:33.429 --> 00:34.962
I stepped on something.

00:35.087 --> 00:37.923
It crackled when I stepped on it.
Then it sort of smooshed.

00:38.270 --> 00:40.382
Then there was this tiny pop.
What is it?

00:41.173 --> 00:43.139
- What is it?
- You mean what was it?

00:43.265 --> 00:45.273
- Do something. Do something!
- All right.

00:45.398 --> 00:47.382
I'm taking off your shoe,
I'll wipe it off.

00:47.507 --> 00:50.256
- No, just throw it away.
- I'm not going to throw it away.

00:50.443 --> 00:51.601
Throw it.

00:52.725 --> 00:54.384
- Did you see that?
- See what?

00:54.509 --> 00:56.846
- God, are you okay?
- What are you doing, Natalie?

00:57.016 --> 01:00.440
- Well, he might need help.
- No, he's fine. I can see it from here.

01:01.501 --> 01:05.165
None of our business.
Okay, come back here. I command you.

01:05.290 --> 01:06.886
- Are you okay?
- What about me?

01:07.011 --> 01:09.566
- I must've hit a pothole.
- What about me?

01:09.924 --> 01:12.483
Are those yours?
Are those yours?

01:13.594 --> 01:15.754
That's my bolt cutters.
I just came from work.

01:15.882 --> 01:17.194
- They're nice.
- Here.

01:18.644 --> 01:22.638
Hate this chain. They always fall off.
Here, you just snap it back on.

01:23.430 --> 01:24.954
- Thanks a lot.
- There you go.

01:25.079 --> 01:27.192
- Glad I could help.
- I'm lucky you came along.

01:27.317 --> 01:28.861
Be careful of the potholes.

01:29.076 --> 01:31.757
Hey, somebody stop that guy!

01:32.257 --> 01:34.954
Don't let him go!
Lady, don't let him go!

01:38.001 --> 01:39.623
- What did you do?
- I...

01:40.165 --> 01:43.601
Hey, somebody stop that guy!
He stole my bike!

Subs-Addicts"
[Sub-way. fr]

02:49.002 --> 02:52.282
I feel terrible about what happened.
I didn't know he was stealing the bike.

02:52.418 --> 02:54.772
Nobody got hurt, that's the main thing.

02:55.894 --> 02:58.381
- What is all this?
- It's a research lab.

02:58.506 --> 03:00.135
Agricultural engineering.

03:00.414 --> 03:04.146
Dean, Dean Berry founded
betavegatech five years ago.

03:04.281 --> 03:07.503
- So what exactly do you do?
- We're saving the world.

03:07.645 --> 03:10.437
Good for you. I was getting
a little worried about the world.

03:12.538 --> 03:14.233
Is that a square tomato?!

03:14.666 --> 03:17.548
Yes, it is.
It's a pet project of Dean's.

03:17.859 --> 03:21.852
The square shape means that farmers
can pack 35% more tomatoes per carton.

03:22.193 --> 03:25.569
- It's cheaper. More efficient.
- So that means

03:26.308 --> 03:29.391
every slice is exactly the same size?

03:29.627 --> 03:32.687
- How does it taste?
- Who cares? It's a square tomato!

03:33.901 --> 03:36.660
- You're doing the lord's work.
- Literally.

03:39.316 --> 03:40.124
Dean?

03:40.249 --> 03:43.550
Mr. Berry, I just wanted
to say I'm sorry about the bike.

03:44.494 --> 03:47.064
We're testing new corn seed.
Their genetically engineered

03:47.189 --> 03:49.151
- to sprout in 20 min.
- More or less.

03:49.276 --> 03:51.347
What you're seeing is going
to revolutionize

03:51.472 --> 03:54.982
- the agriculture industry as you know
- Congratulations on the square tomato.

03:55.439 --> 03:57.580
Do you want one?
You could take one home.

03:58.107 --> 04:00.033
- What's our time?
- 17:30.

04:00.239 --> 04:03.839
Germination complete.
That is our best time yet.

04:03.964 --> 04:07.812
And that, boys and girls,
is how you feed 4 billion people.

04:08.861 --> 04:11.637
We're in business. Call our investors.
Tell them to bring their checkbooks.

04:11.762 --> 04:14.500
I'll set it up for friday.
Dean, this is Adrian Monk.

04:14.625 --> 04:16.624
And, you remember Natalie Teeger?

04:16.749 --> 04:19.341
Yes, of course.
The woman who stole my bike.

04:19.596 --> 04:22.287
- No, I didn't steal your bike.
- No, you're right.

04:22.432 --> 04:26.420
Aided and abetted.
I believe that that is the term.

04:26.545 --> 04:29.156
I'm sorry, I have to lock these up.
Do you mind turning around?

04:29.282 --> 04:31.562
It's just that if somebody
else sees this combination,

04:31.697 --> 04:34.717
I have to memorize a new one. And
I don't want to waste the gray cells.

04:35.600 --> 04:37.891
Mr. Berry,
look, I want to buy you a new bike.

04:38.035 --> 04:41.082
So if you just tell me the make and
the model number, i'm happy to do that.

04:41.207 --> 04:44.256
That's very kind of you, ms. Teeger.
But that's not a bike that can be replaced.

04:44.391 --> 04:46.638
It was a gift from a non-profit
environmental group,

04:46.763 --> 04:50.026
in recognition of my work here.
Had my name engraved on it,

04:50.151 --> 04:53.155
custom seat, cool lock,
eco-friendly hemp basket...

04:53.280 --> 04:55.046
Okay. Then we'll track it down for you.

04:55.171 --> 04:58.249
I promise you. I give you my word
that I will find that bike.

04:58.394 --> 05:01.288
Mr. Monk here is probably
the best detective on the planet.

05:01.413 --> 05:02.581
- He is?
- Yes, sir.

05:02.706 --> 05:04.712
And I know lots of other detectives too.

05:05.055 --> 05:07.465
San Francisco Police Department.
What's going on? You all right?

05:07.590 --> 05:08.623
Yeah, we're fine.

05:08.748 --> 05:11.429
- You said it was an emergency.
- Somebody stole his bike.

05:12.244 --> 05:14.096
- And?
- Rode away.

05:15.550 --> 05:17.224
- And?
- Didn't come back.

05:20.646 --> 05:21.514
And?

05:22.707 --> 05:26.303
- Okay, we're all cued up.
- Hey, when you have a second...

05:26.801 --> 05:28.685
I have an idea for a new vegetable.

05:28.810 --> 05:30.850
We don't really solicit ideas.

05:30.975 --> 05:33.965
It's a hollowed out cumber,
with french dressing already inside.

05:34.346 --> 05:36.553
- You want to know what I call it?
- No, I don't.

05:36.688 --> 05:38.473
Okay, there he is. And that's me.

05:39.590 --> 05:41.546
And this is where
she didn't listen to me.

05:41.677 --> 05:45.657
- What are you saying right there?
- I said, "nice bolt cutters."

05:46.467 --> 05:48.665
- "Nice bolt cutters."
- So what do you think?

05:49.442 --> 05:51.911
Well, I think it's clearly
a job for the bike squad.

05:52.223 --> 05:55.966
- I'll radio that in. It's a 487.
- I didn't know there was a bike squad.

05:56.114 --> 06:00.110
Yeah, we got helicopters. About 800
guys will fan out all around the city.

06:01.404 --> 06:03.398
Fine.
I'll just do it myself.

06:05.647 --> 06:08.638
I can't find it myself, mr. Monk.
I don't even know where to begin.

06:08.763 --> 06:12.563
Natalie, look at this thing.
We've got nature on the run.

06:13.045 --> 06:15.360
Finally.
Look at that.

06:16.220 --> 06:17.165
Look!

06:18.184 --> 06:22.177
It's the perfect sandwich!
Perfect! There's no overlap.

06:22.390 --> 06:25.411
There's no waste. Four 90 degree angles.

06:26.249 --> 06:28.983
This will virtually
eliminate indigestion.

06:29.474 --> 06:31.404
Are you going to help me, or not?

06:34.097 --> 06:36.738
- You can taste the symmetry!
- Please!

06:37.410 --> 06:40.921
I can't run around looking
for a stolen bicycle.

06:41.355 --> 06:44.075
I still have some pride left. Not much.

06:45.184 --> 06:47.892
But my dignity tank
isn't completely empty.

06:48.017 --> 06:49.376
Please, Mr. Monk.

06:49.516 --> 06:53.258
You are so brilliant. It wouldn't
take you more than a couple of hours.

06:53.386 --> 06:54.930
Look, I promised him.

06:55.606 --> 06:57.378
It can count as my birthday gift.

06:58.367 --> 07:00.625
I didn't plan on buying
you a birthday gift.

07:04.966 --> 07:07.311
All right. I'm cashing in my chips.

07:07.696 --> 07:09.432
- What chips?
- My karma chips.

07:09.565 --> 07:12.370
I've been collecting karma
chips every week, every day,

07:12.498 --> 07:14.987
every time I do
something stupid for you.

07:15.612 --> 07:19.419
It's your job.
You're paid. Semi-regularly.

07:19.544 --> 07:22.510
Yeah, I'm not talking about my job.
I'm talking about all the other stuff.

07:22.692 --> 07:26.166
I've been babysitting you
for five years. I've collected, like,

07:26.392 --> 07:29.522
a thousand chips.
And I'm cashing them all in. I'm all in.

07:29.647 --> 07:31.653
You have to help me find the bike.

07:34.450 --> 07:36.612
You'll love this.
You'll love it.

07:38.572 --> 07:40.231
- Yeah, what about him?
- No.

07:40.877 --> 07:43.592
See he's too tall.
You're guy was only 5'71/2"

07:43.781 --> 07:45.728
- How do you know?
- You're 5'5".

07:45.866 --> 07:48.897
You were wearing 11/2" heels.
And he was one inch taller than you.

07:49.022 --> 07:51.071
See. See, you're brilliant.

07:52.178 --> 07:54.633
What are you doing here?
Triple homicide on a pier?

07:55.212 --> 07:58.043
- Not exactly.
- We're looking for a stolen bicycle.

07:58.482 --> 08:01.059
- Kidding, right?
- Natalie had chips.

08:02.285 --> 08:03.308
What about him?

08:10.424 --> 08:11.620
You're right.

08:12.306 --> 08:16.300
John kuramoto. Two convictions.
Auto theft?

08:18.510 --> 08:20.266
Why is he stealing bikes?

08:35.607 --> 08:37.381
Please tell me this isn't it.

08:38.914 --> 08:40.996
Yeah, 322. This is it.

08:42.773 --> 08:45.088
Am I going to need
a tetanus shot after this?

08:45.403 --> 08:46.599
Probably not.

08:51.461 --> 08:53.615
Mr. Monk, look, the bolt cutters.

08:53.908 --> 08:55.908
Yeah, you're right. Those are nice.

08:56.033 --> 08:58.309
Maybe he's riding his bike.
I don't see it.

08:59.355 --> 09:01.142
He's right in there. I can see him.

09:01.267 --> 09:03.737
Playing video games, eating junk food.

09:03.872 --> 09:06.062
- What are we doing here?
- The right thing.

09:12.013 --> 09:15.621
Open up...
It's encyclopedia brown.

09:16.182 --> 09:18.917
Sally and I want our blue bike back,

09:19.517 --> 09:21.583
and the name of your decorator.

09:23.283 --> 09:26.194
You're not in trouble.
Nobody's going to press charges.

09:26.338 --> 09:27.799
We just want the bike.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.249
All right, just do it again.

09:34.689 --> 09:38.027
Oh, my god, mr. Monk!
Oh, my god, mr. Monk!

09:38.658 --> 09:41.050
Help!
Help!

09:58.332 --> 10:01.695
Mr. Monk, it's me. It's Natalie.
How are you feeling?

10:02.249 --> 10:03.522
My leg!

10:05.526 --> 10:06.992
My legs!

10:09.737 --> 10:11.878
- They don't match!
- I know.

10:12.013 --> 10:14.492
I know they don't, mr. Monk.
I am so sorry.

10:14.617 --> 10:18.344
I am so sorry.
I feel just terrible.

10:19.570 --> 10:22.358
- Good.
- I talked to the surgeon.

10:22.483 --> 10:25.035
And guess what?
You have 100 stitches.

10:25.160 --> 10:27.888
An even 100.
I thought that was nice of him.

10:28.635 --> 10:32.493
And, I brought you some new clothes,
so you don't have to worry about that.

10:34.319 --> 10:37.288
Daisies.
100 daisies.

10:38.261 --> 10:41.939
Thank you.
I can watch them die.

10:43.281 --> 10:45.666
And they can do the same for me.

10:45.791 --> 10:48.419
Mr. Monk, don't talk like that.
You're going to be just fine.

10:49.056 --> 10:52.471
Somebody's up. Hello,
good evening. I'm doctor Levinson.

10:52.596 --> 10:55.133
And you are a very lucky man. Yeah.

10:56.920 --> 10:58.676
Is she talking to me?

10:59.054 --> 11:02.034
A few inches over, the bullet
would have severed your femoral artery.

11:02.159 --> 11:05.630
- I'd say that's lucky.
- You know who I think is lucky?

11:06.910 --> 11:08.878
Everybody else in this room.

11:10.195 --> 11:12.548
The unshot people.

11:12.953 --> 11:14.979
The great unshot.

11:16.171 --> 11:17.869
The lead-free.

11:19.113 --> 11:21.485
- Bulletless.
- When can I take him home?

11:21.610 --> 11:25.583
Maybe tomorrow if he's up to it.
Are you a fighter, mr. Monk?

11:29.349 --> 11:32.408
The kid. Kuramoto...
did they get him?

11:32.849 --> 11:35.009
No, he got away.
He went out the back door.

11:35.145 --> 11:37.903
Looks like he took the bike.
It wasn't in the house.

11:38.407 --> 11:41.161
The bike. Oh, my god!
That stupid bike.

11:41.286 --> 11:42.267
What bike?

11:42.452 --> 11:45.151
That's why we were there.
We were looking for a stolen bike.

11:45.286 --> 11:49.191
Shooting someone over a bicycle?
What's the world coming to?

11:50.136 --> 11:52.282
Mr. Monk, they're going to get him.
The captain,

11:52.407 --> 11:55.668
and Randy, and every cop
in the city are looking for this guy.

11:55.803 --> 11:59.323
And the captain, I've never seen
him so mad. And that's saying a lot.

12:03.020 --> 12:04.120
I'm sorry.

12:07.588 --> 12:09.142
You don't know where he is?

12:09.988 --> 12:12.072
You were staying at his house, Vince.

12:12.407 --> 12:14.897
I'm just crashing at
his place for a couple days.

12:15.241 --> 12:18.192
He's just my cousin.
You know where all your cousins are?

12:20.101 --> 12:21.799
Where do you think he is, Vince?

12:23.386 --> 12:25.121
I don't know.

12:35.046 --> 12:36.588
Tough guy.

12:37.323 --> 12:39.839
Look at this. See that? That's a bullet.

12:40.009 --> 12:43.266
That's a bullet that got dug out
of our very dear friend's leg tonight.

12:43.702 --> 12:45.930
That makes your cousin
a former cop shooter.

12:46.943 --> 12:49.248
- Former what?
- Former cop shooter.

12:49.592 --> 12:51.213
You mean he used to shoot cops?

12:52.027 --> 12:54.709
No, he shot someone
who used to be a cop.

12:54.834 --> 12:57.268
- Why didn't you say that?
- D I did. It's the same thing.

12:57.393 --> 12:59.172
It's not the same thing.

12:59.297 --> 13:01.397
For god's sake,
what are you two married, or what?

13:01.522 --> 13:03.686
I mean look,
it's not complicated, Vince.

13:03.821 --> 13:06.445
If you know where your cousin is,
and you're not telling us,

13:06.570 --> 13:08.437
that makes you
an accessory after the fact.

13:08.562 --> 13:10.496
- Aiding and abetting.
- For attempted murder.

13:10.621 --> 13:12.879
Which is a very, very long good-bye.

13:13.130 --> 13:17.070
Let me put it this way, your parole
officer... he hasn't been born yet.

13:22.384 --> 13:23.252
Look...

13:23.850 --> 13:26.759
You don't know John.
You know, he's not a bad guy.

13:28.466 --> 13:31.704
Somebody offered him,
you know, money to steal a bicycle.

13:31.936 --> 13:32.754
Who?

13:32.889 --> 13:35.563
I don't know. He met someone
at a bar. That's all I know.

13:36.635 --> 13:39.877
- Someone paid him to steal that bike?
- Yeah, $3,000.

13:41.723 --> 13:42.996
For a bicycle?

13:49.824 --> 13:50.672
Wipe.

14:00.813 --> 14:01.777
Wipe.

14:11.144 --> 14:12.088
Wipe.

14:13.396 --> 14:15.947
- Wipe!
- Why don't I push?

14:16.188 --> 14:18.123
Where do you want to go?

14:19.241 --> 14:20.862
Over by that wall.

14:21.858 --> 14:24.598
Just planning on staring
at it for a couple of weeks.

14:25.264 --> 14:28.812
You know what?
How about right here?

14:28.937 --> 14:31.693
Right in front of this bright,
sunny window.

14:33.182 --> 14:37.175
Told you to forget about that
stupid bike. You never listen to me.

14:37.492 --> 14:39.284
Mr. Monk, you're right.
I'm so sorry.

14:39.409 --> 14:41.335
This is one of
the worst weeks of my life.

14:41.505 --> 14:44.131
Not exactly a banner week for me either.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.525
- Let's look on the bright side.
- Okay. You go first.

14:47.650 --> 14:51.533
The doctor said it was only going to be
three weeks. That's not bad. And...

14:52.060 --> 14:54.472
Your shoes won't get dirty or wet.

14:54.986 --> 14:58.979
That's your bright side?
My shoes won't get wet?

14:59.778 --> 15:02.585
That's not exactly
blindingly bright, is it?

15:02.795 --> 15:05.727
It's more like a little
25 watt bright side.

15:06.521 --> 15:08.624
I bet you're hungry.
How about some lunch?

15:08.750 --> 15:10.770
How about a BLT?

15:10.895 --> 15:13.075
And not just any ol'BLT.

15:13.210 --> 15:16.556
I'm going to make you a bl-square-t.

15:16.681 --> 15:19.133
No, thank you.
You know what I am in the mood for?

15:19.268 --> 15:20.863
What? Just tell me. Anything.

15:21.582 --> 15:23.868
- Some chips.
- Chips.

15:24.253 --> 15:26.201
Karma chips.

15:27.764 --> 15:29.288
I love them.

15:30.321 --> 15:33.514
Just a big bowl of karma chips.

15:34.662 --> 15:36.204
And guacamole.

15:37.377 --> 15:39.976
Mr. Monk, believe me.
You have all the chips.

15:40.101 --> 15:42.125
You have the whole bank, okay?

15:42.539 --> 15:45.327
I talked to Julie. I told her i'm going
to be staying here with you tonight,

15:45.452 --> 15:48.775
maybe all weekend. And you can
forget about paying me overtime.

15:48.900 --> 15:52.711
- I'll just take the regular salary.
- That's right. It's payday, isn't it?

15:53.360 --> 15:55.746
I wasn't bringing it
up because it's payday.

15:55.871 --> 15:58.010
- I'm saying you don't have to pay...
- I'm sorry.

15:58.135 --> 16:01.819
My checkbook is up there.
On the top shelf.

16:02.473 --> 16:04.373
I can't seem to reach it.

16:07.028 --> 16:09.406
Hey, How's our patient?
You look great.

16:09.613 --> 16:12.075
Nice wheels.
Does that thing have a motor?

16:12.433 --> 16:15.790
I'm the motor. I just feel terrible.
This is all my fault.

16:16.016 --> 16:17.705
Hey, don't beat yourself up.

16:18.338 --> 16:20.281
Let her finish.
What were you saying?

16:20.652 --> 16:21.887
How sorry I was.

16:22.990 --> 16:25.126
- That it?
- How bad I feel.

16:26.400 --> 16:29.745
We got the forensics back
on that bullet. It was a 22 caliber.

16:29.870 --> 16:33.845
And get this. We picked up Kuramoto's
cousin. He says it wasn't random.

16:34.299 --> 16:36.440
Kuramoto was after that particular bike.

16:36.835 --> 16:37.798
You're kidding.

16:37.923 --> 16:40.394
Somebody paid him
three grand to boost it.

16:40.532 --> 16:42.075
$3,000?

16:42.942 --> 16:46.542
Natalie, you got a good look at it. Was
there anything unusual about that bike?

16:47.382 --> 16:49.046
- Like what?
- Solid gold basket?

16:49.449 --> 16:51.918
No, I don't think it
had a solid gold basket.

16:52.103 --> 16:55.151
Maybe the frame was hollow
and had something inside it.

16:55.664 --> 16:56.773
Drugs or cash.

16:56.898 --> 16:59.556
That's what I was thinking. I think
we need to go talk to Dr. Berry again.

16:59.681 --> 17:02.215
We're on our way to his house
right now. You want to come?

17:02.340 --> 17:03.369
I don't think so.

17:03.494 --> 17:05.762
You're going to hang out here
feeling sorry for yourself?

17:05.941 --> 17:08.722
- And complain to Natalie?
- That's the plan.

17:11.294 --> 17:13.713
- Hey, What are you doing?!
- Change of plans.

17:13.838 --> 17:15.867
Change of plans?
What happened to my plan?

17:15.992 --> 17:17.086
New plan.

17:35.821 --> 17:38.169
- Are your hands clean?
- Yes, my hands are clean.

17:38.294 --> 17:40.351
- Come on. Upsy-daisy.
- All right, easy now.

17:40.653 --> 17:42.539
That's too fast. You're going too fast.

17:42.664 --> 17:44.313
- This is too fast?
- Easy.

17:46.030 --> 17:49.578
Okay... just... step away.
I can do it myself.

17:49.817 --> 17:51.759
- Step away. I can do it.
- All right.

17:51.884 --> 17:53.165
- All right.
- I'll do it.

18:07.090 --> 18:09.723
I can't do it myself. I can't.

18:10.673 --> 18:13.972
- Come on. Up you come.
- All right, easy now. Okay, one...

18:14.429 --> 18:17.224
- Ready.
- Okay! What, what?

18:18.862 --> 18:21.776
I can do it! I'll do it.
Let me do it.

18:22.525 --> 18:23.682
I'll do it.

18:33.974 --> 18:37.273
I can't do it.
I can't do it myself. Help m...

18:38.771 --> 18:41.188
Come here.
There you go.

18:41.313 --> 18:43.185
I can't find the release on this thing.

18:43.315 --> 18:46.295
- It's the red latch on the handle.
- This one?

18:46.783 --> 18:49.507
- On the handle. The other one.
- The red handle.

18:49.632 --> 18:51.021
Okay, see?

18:52.735 --> 18:54.953
- Pull it, pull it.
- Just step on the thing.

18:56.695 --> 18:58.238
You got to unlock it.

19:08.677 --> 19:11.187
Grab that side.
Pull. Pull.

19:11.321 --> 19:13.440
- Just push it down. There you go.
- All right.

19:15.744 --> 19:17.540
I got you. I got you.

19:22.375 --> 19:24.217
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

19:28.519 --> 19:31.201
- Easy.
- The solar panel.

19:32.881 --> 19:36.042
- Must be "off the grid."
- Go slow.

19:36.958 --> 19:39.673
Slow.
Easy, easy.

19:40.294 --> 19:41.143
Slow.

19:44.134 --> 19:46.518
- Okay, and... up.
- Easy.

19:46.842 --> 19:49.554
I'll get it. Here we go.
On three.

19:49.901 --> 19:51.811
- Easy.
- One, two, three.

19:54.014 --> 19:55.036
Hang on.

19:57.309 --> 19:59.181
God! God, that...

20:06.013 --> 20:09.185
- All right.
- Nobody's home.

20:11.139 --> 20:12.007
Sorry.

20:13.342 --> 20:15.899
I do have one suggestion.
Just a thought.

20:16.411 --> 20:18.283
Next time we go somewhere...

20:19.745 --> 20:21.306
Call ahead first.

20:22.901 --> 20:24.555
Easy, easy.

20:24.690 --> 20:27.800
- Go easy.
- Easy!

20:30.591 --> 20:32.820
I thought you guys were
joking about the bike squad.

20:32.945 --> 20:34.831
- I like that car.
- Look at that.

20:34.956 --> 20:36.528
- Who is it?
- Look at that thing.

20:36.653 --> 20:38.539
What kind of gas mileage
do you get with this?

20:38.664 --> 20:40.887
Mileage? I haven't worried
about mileage in years.

20:41.012 --> 20:44.570
This is aerodynamically perfect.
100% fossil-free.

20:44.695 --> 20:47.711
Built-in solar panels.
This is the future on wheels.

20:48.783 --> 20:50.056
What happened to you?

20:52.429 --> 20:53.289
Had chips.

20:53.732 --> 20:56.838
We were looking for your stolen bike,
and Mr. Monk got shot.

20:58.680 --> 21:00.417
Man. What is happening to us?

21:00.940 --> 21:04.933
The family of man, we're hurting each
other, we're stealing from each other.

21:05.220 --> 21:07.555
Family of man's starting
to sound like a real family.

21:07.701 --> 21:10.437
You know what I'm going to do for you?
I am going to adopt ten acres

21:10.562 --> 21:13.505
- of Brazilian rain forest in your name.
- Thank you.

21:14.287 --> 21:16.127
I don't have to visit it, do i? Or...

21:16.390 --> 21:18.502
or water it? Or think about it?

21:20.316 --> 21:21.454
Professor Berry...

21:21.660 --> 21:24.428
Somebody paid that young
man to steal your bicycle.

21:24.553 --> 21:26.224
Apparently they paid him a lot of money.

21:26.349 --> 21:29.177
- You're kidding.
- We were hoping you could tell us why.

21:29.302 --> 21:31.285
Was there anything
unusual about your bike?

21:31.455 --> 21:33.009
- Like what?
- A gold basket.

21:33.362 --> 21:34.250
Or...

21:35.376 --> 21:37.611
- Or what?
- Or anything else.

21:37.736 --> 21:41.077
Could some... could somethin
have been hidden inside the frame?

21:41.298 --> 21:42.566
I can't imagine it.

21:42.701 --> 21:45.903
The frame was filled with polycarbonate
honeycomb for better stability.

21:46.303 --> 21:48.103
I understand the bike was a gift?

21:49.079 --> 21:52.338
- It was. From the visionary project.
- I've never heard of them.

21:52.463 --> 21:54.180
Neither had I until the bike arrived.

21:54.467 --> 21:57.592
Sarah Longson, my assistant, wheeled
it in with a big bow, and a very,

21:57.723 --> 21:59.225
very complimentary letter.

21:59.456 --> 22:01.559
- Do you still have the letter?
- I shredded it.

22:01.684 --> 22:03.643
- Repulped it. Recycled it.
- Of course you did.

22:03.780 --> 22:07.227
That's okay, we can figure
out who they are if they do exist.

22:07.352 --> 22:09.349
I don't understand.
It doesn't make any sense.

22:09.474 --> 22:12.368
Well, one thing's for sure,
it makes a lot of sense to somebody.

22:22.676 --> 22:25.158
- Over here.
- You scared me.

22:25.886 --> 22:27.122
Were you followed?

22:27.495 --> 22:30.047
It's cool, it's cool.
I did what you said. I took two buses.

22:30.184 --> 22:32.951
Sorry about that cop.
Okay, I... I didn't have a choice.

22:33.076 --> 22:35.996
I got two strikes against me already.
I couldn't take another hit.

22:36.222 --> 22:38.923
Of course, it couldn't be helped.
It was him or you, right?

22:39.830 --> 22:41.005
It's payday.

22:41.957 --> 22:44.349
There's a little extra in there.
Travel expenses.

22:44.479 --> 22:46.975
You shot a cop. You're going
to have to disappear for a while.

22:47.100 --> 22:50.583
I don't see a problem with that.
If you're ever in Mexico, look me up.

22:51.313 --> 22:53.034
You have something for me?

22:56.298 --> 22:57.244
Right here.

23:01.125 --> 23:04.384
And the gun you shot Adrian Monk with?
You better give it to me.

23:04.509 --> 23:07.336
It's the only evidence they have
against us. I'll get rid of it.

23:15.504 --> 23:17.588
- Thanks.
- So I guess this is good-bye.

23:18.700 --> 23:20.394
Couldn't have said it better myself.

23:35.635 --> 23:38.683
- Sorry, sorry.
- Wait, wait, wait.

23:39.014 --> 23:40.471
- Careful!
- Sorry.

23:40.596 --> 23:43.065
Well, what are you...
It's over there. What are you doing?

23:44.613 --> 23:47.834
Just... easy, would you?
Please slow down.

23:48.055 --> 23:49.230
I'm sorry.

23:50.526 --> 23:52.194
Sorry Mrs. Corren.

23:52.319 --> 23:55.788
What are you apologizing to her for?
Did you get her shot too?

23:55.913 --> 23:57.030
Oh, god.

24:00.256 --> 24:03.188
I'm sorry, I'm just... you know what?
Hold... I'm just tired, mr. Monk.

24:03.330 --> 24:06.060
I was up all night building
that ramp for your back door.

24:06.185 --> 24:09.161
- Well the ramp was your idea.
- I know, and I'm happy to do it.

24:09.286 --> 24:11.679
It's just that I haven't
been home in three days.

24:11.917 --> 24:13.570
And I haven't seen my daughter.

24:14.089 --> 24:16.747
I understand. Why don't you take
the rest of the day off?

24:16.872 --> 24:20.105
- Really?
- Sure. I can make my own dinner.

24:20.351 --> 24:23.763
I'll just eat whatever's on the bottom
shelf. You know, whatever I can reach.

24:23.888 --> 24:25.418
Whatever's in the crisper.

24:25.634 --> 24:28.374
Then I'll just hop around for a while,
and drag myself into bed.

24:28.517 --> 24:30.119
- You go have fun.
- I'll stay.

24:30.244 --> 24:32.278
- It's up to you.
- How are you? Are you okay?

24:32.403 --> 24:34.641
- I've been better.
- Not you. How are you?

24:35.716 --> 24:39.559
I'm fine. We're fine.
Just getting a workout with my arms.

24:40.384 --> 24:41.978
- Is it the guy?
- Yes, sir.

24:42.103 --> 24:44.207
John Kuramoto, the mystery bike thief.

24:44.593 --> 24:47.200
Couple cemetery workers
found him about an hour ago.

24:47.775 --> 24:49.480
Pretty convenient place to catch it.

24:49.785 --> 24:53.760
We found the shell. 32 caliber. Probably
from the same gun they used on you.

24:54.380 --> 24:56.985
I can't believe he's dead.
What is it about that bike?

24:57.115 --> 24:59.372
We talked to the visionary project too.

24:59.527 --> 25:02.532
They never heard of dean berry.
And they never sent anyone a bike.

25:05.352 --> 25:06.542
To the left.

25:07.606 --> 25:10.441
A little more slowly.
Slowly. A little more.

25:12.800 --> 25:14.758
That's too far. Back to the right.

25:14.985 --> 25:18.426
Slowly, slowly, slowly...
that's too much! Too much!

25:18.553 --> 25:21.766
- Why don't you just turn your neck?
- Because this the way I want to do it.

25:22.245 --> 25:23.813
Keep going to the right.

25:25.037 --> 25:28.355
Wait, wait. Okay, wait,
Right there.

25:31.923 --> 25:35.000
- It's a tire track.
- Is that from the bike?

25:37.142 --> 25:40.185
- No, it's not a bike. It was wider.
- Was it a car?

25:40.310 --> 25:43.531
I can't tell.
There's more over there.

25:44.756 --> 25:48.701
And some over there.
It keeps changing direction. You know?

25:49.277 --> 25:50.794
I don't know if I can... maybe.

25:51.511 --> 25:53.672
I don't... is that...
Is that one right there?

25:56.011 --> 25:59.238
- Oh, my god, Mr. Monk are you okay?
- What did you do?

25:59.431 --> 26:02.974
- I didn't do anything.
- Help me up! Wait, wait.

26:03.100 --> 26:04.913
No, wait. I have a better idea.

26:05.038 --> 26:08.537
As long I'm down here, would just shovel
some dirt over me. Get it over with.

26:08.672 --> 26:10.532
- Natalie, take a break.
- Are you sure?

26:10.673 --> 26:13.036
I got him.
We'll meet you back at the car.

26:13.161 --> 26:14.859
Come here. Come on.

26:16.370 --> 26:18.222
There we go.
All right.

26:21.179 --> 26:24.015
Yeah, we'll take a photograph.
Do you got a minute?

26:25.797 --> 26:28.065
- Do I have a min? I'm in a wheelchair.
- Look...

26:28.293 --> 26:30.913
I know that this is tough,
but this is tough on Natalie too.

26:31.038 --> 26:34.596
You see this guy here? That's the guy
that shot you. The guy in the body bag.

26:34.970 --> 26:37.247
And you're madder
at her than you are at him.

26:38.075 --> 26:41.225
- She hasn't said anything.
- Of course she hasn't said anything.

26:41.350 --> 26:44.034
She blames herself for what happened.
She...

26:45.797 --> 26:48.517
Look, I know you caught a bad break.
I'm sorry you're in pain.

26:48.642 --> 26:50.866
Sorry you're miserable. Sorry, sorry.

26:50.991 --> 26:53.822
But you can't keep taking
everything out on her.

26:54.437 --> 26:55.776
Listen, detective Monk...

26:57.043 --> 27:00.276
Be very careful, because you're
that close from losing that girl.

27:00.662 --> 27:01.895
Ask me how I know.

27:03.355 --> 27:05.785
- How do you know?
- Because you're acting like me.

27:37.807 --> 27:38.945
Oh, god.

27:46.403 --> 27:47.966
Natalie, do you resent me?

27:48.773 --> 27:52.449
Don't be silly. You were shot
in the leg. You're seriously injured.

27:53.686 --> 27:55.056
That's what I thought.

27:55.796 --> 27:58.338
The captain is concerned about you.

27:59.346 --> 28:02.626
He doesn't understand our relationship.
Pothole!

28:02.846 --> 28:04.646
- Pothole.
- Sorry. Sorry.

28:05.405 --> 28:07.817
- Where to next?
- Let me see.

28:09.493 --> 28:12.234
Okay, we have to go up
to the mountain view deli.

28:12.363 --> 28:14.981
And back down to the valley pharmacy.

28:15.191 --> 28:17.834
And then back up to
the hilltop dry cleaner.

28:18.695 --> 28:21.456
Do you think we could combine
the mountain view deli and

28:21.615 --> 28:23.303
the hilltop cleaners? Just

28:23.693 --> 28:26.207
before we do the valley thing,
so we're not going

28:26.454 --> 28:29.495
- up, and down, and...
- I know.

28:31.124 --> 28:33.343
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

28:37.682 --> 28:41.518
I can't go on. I can't go on like this.
I can't keep on apologizing.

28:41.750 --> 28:45.716
I'm sorry, I haven't slept
in three days. I'm going broke.

28:45.841 --> 28:49.365
Your insurance wouldn't cover
the wheelchair. I had to rent it myself.

28:52.130 --> 28:55.642
Just let me finish, okay?
I didn't shoot you, Mr. Monk.

28:55.830 --> 28:58.588
You have to forgive people.
Say you forgive me.

28:58.713 --> 29:01.809
Three little words, that's all I need.
Just three little words and it'll just

29:01.934 --> 29:03.802
- release me.
- Natalie, we're braked.

29:03.927 --> 29:06.773
You're right, I just got to pick it up.
I don't need a break.

29:09.078 --> 29:10.283
I don't need a break.

29:16.257 --> 29:18.021
- Is that it?
- Yes, sir.

29:18.151 --> 29:20.751
"For professor Dean Berry
in deepest appreciation."

29:20.876 --> 29:22.832
That's the bike.
And it was in the dumpster?

29:22.957 --> 29:25.209
Yes, sir. We downloaded this unit

29:25.446 --> 29:28.070
at approximately 14:30 this afternoon.

29:28.215 --> 29:31.065
I read about the stolen bike
in the paper, and the officer

29:31.190 --> 29:34.161
that was shot over it.
I like to read the police blotter.

29:34.286 --> 29:36.724
- Is that a fact?
- I think it's my civic duty. You see,

29:36.849 --> 29:38.771
I like to think
of the sanitation department

29:38.915 --> 29:40.905
as being the eyes
and the ears of the city.

29:41.030 --> 29:44.187
Captain, this is Ronnie O'dell.
He's been...

29:44.396 --> 29:45.988
- very helpful.
- Sounds like it.

29:46.113 --> 29:48.151
So the bike was just
sitting there on top?

29:48.279 --> 29:51.628
No sir. It was buried. It was on or
beneath, what we like to call

29:51.753 --> 29:53.987
the "nadir," see,
which is very important to us.

29:54.112 --> 29:56.416
Because we know when
this unit was last emptied.

29:56.541 --> 29:58.605
Which means
that we can pinpoint the day,

29:58.742 --> 30:01.860
and even approximate
the time when the bike was discarded.

30:02.004 --> 30:04.563
- Which was...?
- 3:30. Monday afternoon.

30:04.727 --> 30:06.926
About 20 minutes after it was stolen.

30:08.316 --> 30:12.138
The bike rack is about a 1/2 mile
away. So what, the guy steals the bike,

30:12.263 --> 30:14.919
he rides a couple of blocks,
and then throws it away?

30:15.044 --> 30:16.540
- Yes, sir.
- Apparently.

30:16.955 --> 30:19.573
He didn't want the bike.
After all of this.

30:20.816 --> 30:23.535
- What the hell's going on?
- We don't know, sir.

30:23.758 --> 30:26.459
Frankly, the lieutenant and I...
We're stymied.

30:28.221 --> 30:29.398
We found the basket.

30:30.892 --> 30:34.124
Randy, get it over with. Tell me now.
Is the basket made of gold?

30:34.801 --> 30:38.640
No, it's a basic basket. The...
he've been through this whole truck,

30:39.419 --> 30:42.436
only thing we can't find...
Is the bell, the cable, and the lock.

30:42.561 --> 30:43.700
Wait a second.

30:45.406 --> 30:46.622
What do you got?

30:48.186 --> 30:50.848
Good, you found the bell.
Thank you.

30:52.773 --> 30:54.779
You can stop ringing the bell now.

31:01.902 --> 31:04.979
- 52.30.
- I don't understand.

31:07.358 --> 31:09.787
I do not understand.

31:12.059 --> 31:13.350
It's not working.

31:15.809 --> 31:17.121
I don't understand.

31:25.828 --> 31:26.928
Oh, god.

31:34.098 --> 31:36.514
- Does this look green?
- Sorry.

31:36.826 --> 31:39.524
What happened? What went wrong?

31:39.649 --> 31:43.325
What is missing? These compounds
are identical. I checked them twice.

31:44.281 --> 31:46.352
I wish I could stay and help,
but I'm leaving

31:46.477 --> 31:48.827
in ten minutes. My china trip, rember?

31:50.138 --> 31:52.855
I forgot.
The yangtze river awaits.

31:53.739 --> 31:56.135
I'm being so selfish. Of course.
I want you to go.

31:56.260 --> 31:59.057
And I want you to have fun.
Don't worry about me.

32:01.381 --> 32:03.114
Oh, my god. You found it!

32:03.335 --> 32:06.051
Mr. Berry, I've been waiting
all week all week to say this.

32:06.942 --> 32:07.858
Where was it?

32:07.983 --> 32:11.004
It was in some dumpster up the street.
I tried to clean it as best as I could.

32:11.129 --> 32:14.649
You didn't need to do that.
I owe you an apology.

32:14.921 --> 32:17.950
In fact, I owe an apology
to the entire family of man.

32:18.183 --> 32:19.847
This is just what the doctor ordered.

32:19.974 --> 32:21.609
- Good.
- Especially after today.

32:21.734 --> 32:25.027
We had some investors here,
and, the seeds didn't work.

32:25.152 --> 32:26.889
I'm so sorry.

32:28.351 --> 32:30.589
- It's still a little dirty right there.
- That's okay.

32:30.719 --> 32:33.150
- But i, you know...
- God, it's in good shape.

32:33.436 --> 32:36.131
It looks like i'm not
the only one with a new set of wheels!

32:36.266 --> 32:39.658
We had a... little accident.
With the other wheelchair.

32:39.783 --> 32:41.885
- She tried to kill me.
- So we upgraded.

32:47.014 --> 32:49.753
This dang thing is stuck now.

32:50.177 --> 32:53.037
- Here.
- All right. I can do it.

32:53.215 --> 32:55.742
Let me do it. I am not a...

32:57.295 --> 32:59.829
- Let me do it.
- All right.

33:06.955 --> 33:10.155
Natalie, now...
Look what you made me do.

33:10.280 --> 33:13.022
Mr. Monk.
Is there a kill switch on that?

33:13.147 --> 33:15.192
Stop it! Help, help.

33:21.163 --> 33:22.536
Stop it! God.

33:23.856 --> 33:27.166
- Oh, god. Here you go.
- You're okay. You're okay.

33:30.644 --> 33:34.219
God. Watch it, watch it.
You're hurting me.

33:34.521 --> 33:36.884
Do something, no...
She's fainted down.

33:44.060 --> 33:45.893
This goes... on.

33:49.399 --> 33:51.202
Look what you've done. This

33:51.555 --> 33:54.352
death trap is worse
than the other death trap.

33:55.976 --> 33:57.171
Sorry, Mr. Monk.

34:00.124 --> 34:01.474
Are you all right?

34:03.295 --> 34:04.742
Is Mr. Monk okay?

34:07.488 --> 34:08.993
This girl is dehydrated.

34:10.087 --> 34:12.634
Has she not had
a steady intake of fluids?

34:14.768 --> 34:17.257
- I don't know.
- Has she been sleeping?

34:19.060 --> 34:22.438
- I don't know.
- Does she eat?

34:24.672 --> 34:26.922
Well, I think... I don't know.

34:28.998 --> 34:30.174
Stay right here.

34:31.052 --> 34:33.791
I'm going to get you
some juice and some vitamins.

34:34.592 --> 34:36.792
- Okay, thanks.
- You're going to be fine.

34:43.784 --> 34:45.308
Dear god. What have I done?

34:59.872 --> 35:00.740
Wipe?

35:12.606 --> 35:15.414
I've been a fool.
I've been a Jerk. I'm so sorry.

35:17.612 --> 35:18.795
Here, go like this.

35:20.378 --> 35:21.592
Go like this.

35:24.502 --> 35:25.774
What are you doing?

35:26.331 --> 35:28.911
Those are chips.
I'm giving them all back to you.

35:30.559 --> 35:32.831
I'm sorry. Leland was right. I have been

35:33.326 --> 35:35.120
taking everything out on you.

35:37.385 --> 35:40.209
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you, Mr. Monk.

35:40.718 --> 35:44.018
- See, was that so hard?
- It was pretty hard.

35:45.523 --> 35:46.835
Here, drink this.

35:47.248 --> 35:50.650
I want you to take three of these, twice
a day. It's my personal formula.

35:51.120 --> 35:52.966
- You're going to be fine.
- Thank you.

35:53.091 --> 35:55.409
Mr. Monk, we should go.
They've had a bad day.

35:55.788 --> 35:57.660
Their super seed didn't sprout.

35:58.437 --> 36:00.936
We'll be fine.
It's back to the drawing board.

36:01.061 --> 36:04.290
Back To the gene splicer.
Thank you again, for the bike.

36:04.415 --> 36:06.726
- Just don't leave it unlocked.
- It was locked.

36:10.652 --> 36:13.584
- They never found the lock.
- Pardon me?

36:17.571 --> 36:19.655
The lock that came with your bike...

36:19.918 --> 36:22.211
They found the basket, and the bell,

36:23.011 --> 36:24.587
but they never found the lock.

36:25.612 --> 36:27.706
- What did it look like?
- The lock?

36:27.831 --> 36:31.362
It was kind of a high-tech thing,
with a... a keypad.

36:33.227 --> 36:36.106
- Like that one?
- Yeah, as a matter of fact.

36:36.604 --> 36:40.058
And you could set your own combination?

36:40.445 --> 36:42.149
That's right. Eight digits.

36:44.386 --> 36:45.948
Are you going somewhere?

36:48.453 --> 36:52.039
As a matter of fact, I am.
China.
For three weeks.

36:53.506 --> 36:54.642
Professor berry,

36:54.915 --> 36:58.522
I can tell you why your experiment
failed today, it was sabotaged.

36:59.714 --> 37:00.712
And she did it.

37:01.661 --> 37:02.989
You must be joking!

37:03.114 --> 37:06.404
You hired John Kuramoto
to steal that bike.

37:06.680 --> 37:10.540
But it was never really about the bike,
was it? You wanted the lock.

37:11.485 --> 37:12.816
Here's what happened...

37:13.112 --> 37:15.850
Those genetically altered
seeds were worth a fortune.

37:15.975 --> 37:17.769
You could sell them to anyone.

37:17.994 --> 37:20.097
Your friends in China, for instance.

37:20.225 --> 37:23.610
All you need was the combination.
Your plan was simple.

37:24.119 --> 37:27.051
You showed up with a new bike,
you said it was a gift.

37:27.379 --> 37:30.910
It was an ordinary bike,
but the lock was something special.

37:31.195 --> 37:35.127
You had designed it yourself.
It had an eight digit combination.

37:35.270 --> 37:36.389
You knew your boss.

37:36.523 --> 37:39.439
You knew he'd never memorize
a whole new set of numbers.

37:39.564 --> 37:41.332
If somebody else sees this combination,

37:41.457 --> 37:44.289
I have to memorize a new one, and
I don't want to waste the grey cells.

37:44.414 --> 37:45.457
She was right.

37:46.151 --> 37:48.554
- I used the same combination.
- Most people do.

37:48.679 --> 37:51.373
It's human nature.
I use the same password for everything.

37:52.202 --> 37:55.694
Kuramoto stole the bike,
and more importantly, the lock.

37:55.826 --> 37:57.310
That night, you went to work.

37:57.769 --> 38:01.627
All you had to do was
retrieve the new combination.

38:05.948 --> 38:09.749
As you predicted, he had use
the same numbers for both.

38:11.420 --> 38:15.414
You replaced the genetically
altered seeds with a few ordinary ones.

38:15.583 --> 38:19.393
You knew you'd be long gone
by the time anybody suspected anything.

38:20.159 --> 38:23.447
Dean, who is this guy?
I don't have to listen to this.

38:23.578 --> 38:25.588
- You can't prove any of it.
- It's true.

38:26.159 --> 38:29.463
We'll never find those seeds now.
You had five days to hide them.

38:29.923 --> 38:32.685
But we can prove that you killed
Mr. Kuramoto.

38:36.048 --> 38:39.424
Are those your sandals?
They're quite unusual.

38:39.647 --> 38:42.689
They're made from recycled tires.
They're eco-friendly.

38:43.031 --> 38:45.153
They may be eco,
but they're not friendly.

38:49.958 --> 38:51.849
I've seen those tread marks before.

38:52.709 --> 38:55.449
In the cemetery, near Kuramoto's body.

38:56.295 --> 38:57.894
I thought they were tire tracks.

38:58.019 --> 39:00.064
Sarah, tell me the truth.
Did you do this?

39:02.586 --> 39:04.795
My eyes!
I'm fine. Get her!

39:05.131 --> 39:07.628
Get her, don't let her get away.
I'm fine.

39:33.389 --> 39:36.628
Hold on! Don't move. Just stop!
Put it down. Put it down.

39:36.784 --> 39:39.331
Don't move, I swear to god.
I swear to god i'll shoot.

39:40.875 --> 39:43.541
- Hang on!
- It's okay, Mr. Monk.

39:43.723 --> 39:45.460
It's all over. I did it!

39:48.580 --> 39:50.837
For the love of god.

39:53.658 --> 39:54.507
Wipe.

40:01.727 --> 40:02.844
You're awake.

40:05.372 --> 40:06.915
Yes, Mr. Monk. I'm right here.

40:12.318 --> 40:15.297
- Chips.
- I know, Mr. Monk.

40:16.869 --> 40:20.178
- Chips.
- Mr. Monk, you have all the chips.

40:24.964 --> 40:26.173
- Chips.
- Yes.

40:26.298 --> 40:29.054
Mr Monk, I understand
every chip there is.

40:32.128 --> 40:36.103
Look, on the bright side,
these two legs match.
