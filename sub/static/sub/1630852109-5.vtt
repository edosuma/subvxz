WEBVTT

00:06.200 --> 00:08.960
A NETFLIX SERIES

01:08.640 --> 01:11.360
REBIBBIA RULES

01:29.280 --> 01:32.360
Anyhow, we may be losers,
but we're not psychopaths.

01:32.440 --> 01:35.600
At some point, Alice and I became friends.

01:36.360 --> 01:38.840
We weren't Dawson and Joey
from<i> Dawson's Creek.</i>

01:38.920 --> 01:41.120
I'm not a mopey 35-year-old high schooler,

01:41.200 --> 01:44.640
I'd rather wear a suicide belt
on the Ponte Milvio.

01:49.040 --> 01:51.480
We'd start relationships,

01:51.560 --> 01:53.200
but we never discussed them.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.120
We knew we were seeing other people

01:55.200 --> 01:58.560
and things were good,
but we wouldn't mention it.

01:58.640 --> 02:01.600
It's like homosexuality in the US Army.

02:01.680 --> 02:02.880
Everything is fine!

02:02.960 --> 02:06.560
Don't ask, don't tell. Everyone is happy.

02:11.680 --> 02:13.800
We'd tell each other
about breakups, though.

02:13.880 --> 02:15.160
WE HAD A BIG FIGHT

02:15.240 --> 02:19.480
One of the reasons was that at one point
she ended up in a bad relationship.

02:19.560 --> 02:22.160
It happens to a lot of people.

02:22.240 --> 02:25.240
I don't know the details.
Maybe I didn't want to know.

02:25.320 --> 02:28.080
But I'm pretty sure it was toxic.

02:28.160 --> 02:29.800
The whole thing was ugly.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.560
It's hard to talk about it now.

02:35.640 --> 02:38.240
If you know a friend is being hit,
you should act,

02:38.320 --> 02:40.840
but not in a testosterone-filled rage way.

02:40.920 --> 02:42.800
Have you hurt my friend?!

02:42.880 --> 02:44.760
I'll kill you! You bastard!

02:44.840 --> 02:47.000
You should be there for her, support her,

02:47.080 --> 02:48.960
and help her to get out of it.

02:49.040 --> 02:50.720
If you want to kill him,

02:50.800 --> 02:52.640
you can always do it later.

02:52.720 --> 02:54.560
There's no expiration date.

02:54.640 --> 02:56.320
But hindsight is a great thing.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.240
She had sort of disappeared,

02:58.320 --> 03:00.400
and when we asked how she was, she'd say…

03:00.480 --> 03:01.840
<i>It's all good.</i>

03:01.920 --> 03:03.640
When they fought she'd cry for days,

03:03.720 --> 03:06.600
but then she'd go back to him
and defend him.

03:11.280 --> 03:14.360
In the end, you get tired
of chasing people.

03:14.440 --> 03:15.640
I THINK IT'S OVER

03:15.720 --> 03:16.720
You end up thinking,

03:16.800 --> 03:18.840
if she doesn't want help,
we can't force her.

03:18.920 --> 03:20.040
I'm no Mandrake.

03:20.120 --> 03:21.920
THE COUPLE BREAKER

03:22.000 --> 03:24.080
It's a sound principle, but also an alibi

03:24.160 --> 03:26.200
for when you can't be bothered anymore.

03:26.280 --> 03:29.480
There's a fine line between the two
and only your conscience knows it.

03:29.560 --> 03:30.640
I take notes.

03:30.720 --> 03:33.880
No external tribunal
will be able to touch you.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.440
One day, they broke up and it looked real.

03:41.520 --> 03:43.800
Drama, tears, snot, devastation.

03:43.880 --> 03:45.280
Jesus, Alice!

03:45.360 --> 03:48.320
It's 2:00 a.m. If you want me
to come to you now,

03:48.400 --> 03:49.880
you can't fuck him for a month!

03:49.960 --> 03:52.120
Otherwise, I'll call emergency services

03:52.200 --> 03:55.040
and tell them
you're copulating with a Dumpster.

03:55.120 --> 03:56.800
I'll make up some bullshit

03:56.880 --> 03:59.400
and I promise they'll ship you to rehab.

03:59.480 --> 04:01.680
<i>It's over, I swear.</i>

04:01.760 --> 04:03.360
Even if you make up

04:03.440 --> 04:05.760
and he comes to you with 450 red roses

04:05.840 --> 04:08.320
and sings you
that Tiziano Ferro song, you say…

04:08.400 --> 04:11.160
Sorry, but that poor guy
got up at 2:00 a.m.,

04:11.240 --> 04:14.040
and now, just to be fair,
you'll have to jerk off for a month.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.600
<i>It's over, I'm telling you.</i>

04:19.000 --> 04:19.880
HAPPINESS IS COLLUSION

04:21.480 --> 04:23.320
If I have to go out after 9:00 p.m.,

04:23.400 --> 04:26.920
my body feels like it has
a gravity field as strong as Jupiter's.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.760
So I ask the armadillo…

04:28.840 --> 04:31.440
Can you come too?
We'll only stay an hour or so.

04:31.520 --> 04:32.360
He replies…

04:32.440 --> 04:34.960
Sure. You take the car,
I'll follow in the…

04:35.040 --> 04:37.720
How do you say it? You know, the thing.

04:37.800 --> 04:38.640
Oh, right.

04:38.720 --> 04:40.160
I'll fucking stay in bed.

04:57.560 --> 04:59.800
ICE CREAM

05:41.760 --> 05:44.000
I don't remember what we spoke about,

05:44.080 --> 05:46.560
but it felt like
an out-of-body experience.

05:46.640 --> 05:48.000
I was out there,

05:48.080 --> 05:50.080
watching these two people hugging

05:50.160 --> 05:53.240
for longer than they had ever hugged
in years of friendship.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.680
She was saying some deep stuff,
now I don't remember,

05:55.760 --> 05:57.800
but some really emotional stuff.

05:57.880 --> 05:59.680
I do remember one sentence…

05:59.760 --> 06:02.880
<i>It doesn't matter</i>
<i>that you aren't always here,</i>

06:02.960 --> 06:05.800
<i>it matters that when you're here,</i>
<i>you're really here.</i>

06:05.880 --> 06:06.920
<i>Do you get me?</i>

06:07.000 --> 06:08.680
No, I fucking don't!

06:08.760 --> 06:11.320
I don't understand these things.
It's a flaw of mine.

06:11.400 --> 06:13.960
I'm the unbeaten king of practical help,

06:14.040 --> 06:16.000
the Michael Jordan of customer support.

06:16.080 --> 06:18.960
Has your car broken down at 4:00 a.m.?

06:19.040 --> 06:21.000
I'll put my shoes on and come to you.

06:22.080 --> 06:26.680
Are you hungry? I'll buy 800 burgers
and pay for them with my own kidney.

06:26.760 --> 06:29.720
Are you thirsty?
I'll bring you fresh water in my ears.

06:33.960 --> 06:38.480
I can do absolutely anything that is
inherently practical and can be touched.

06:38.560 --> 06:41.160
But anything even remotely abstract,

06:41.240 --> 06:45.000
that has to do with emotional support
and vague stuff, and I freak out

06:45.080 --> 06:46.640
because I don't understand.

06:46.720 --> 06:48.880
What do you mean,
I need to be really here?

06:48.960 --> 06:51.440
Do you mean, I shouldn't try to trick you

06:51.520 --> 06:54.400
and send you a hologram of myself?

06:56.400 --> 06:58.400
I don't get it, is this some emo shit?

06:58.480 --> 06:59.480
I get anxiety.

06:59.560 --> 07:02.560
I worry she might say something
even more intense,

07:02.640 --> 07:03.720
and what do I say?

07:03.800 --> 07:05.880
We're hugging and saying sweet stuff,

07:05.960 --> 07:08.000
we'll end up kissing.

07:08.080 --> 07:09.840
It should be beautiful,

07:09.920 --> 07:12.480
but I feel like the police
are about to charge in.

07:12.560 --> 07:14.960
They're all lined up,

07:15.040 --> 07:17.080
and it's a matter of moments.

07:17.160 --> 07:20.920
You keep an eye on the road to the right
which is the only one still open.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.360
There is a surreal sense of calm
that you know is about to crumble.

07:24.440 --> 07:25.680
As soon as they move,

07:25.760 --> 07:27.520
you'll have to run that way.

07:27.600 --> 07:28.440
And you think…

07:28.520 --> 07:30.760
Is that not the coward's way out?

07:31.360 --> 07:33.440
The tension is peaking.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.000
I must do something.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.920
One of us needs to
take responsibility for this.

07:40.120 --> 07:41.560
I come back to my senses

07:41.640 --> 07:45.000
and utter the most beautiful words
I can think of…

07:45.520 --> 07:47.920
The same words Beatrice says to Dante

07:48.000 --> 07:50.080
when they meet in Heaven…

07:50.720 --> 07:52.720
I think the ice cream is melting.

07:54.880 --> 07:58.240
I know it's not the kind of stuff
Michel Gondry writes

07:58.320 --> 08:01.000
in his sickly-sweet movies.

08:02.640 --> 08:05.920
But I grew up with someone
who for 20 years

08:06.000 --> 08:08.720
has only uttered one crucial demand…

08:08.800 --> 08:12.400
Wanna get an ice cream?

08:16.720 --> 08:18.920
The evening is under control again.

08:19.520 --> 08:22.560
I spill pistachio ice cream on myself.

08:22.640 --> 08:25.800
We eat till we burst
and watch reruns of <i>Gilmore Girls</i>

08:25.880 --> 08:28.800
like two real desperate housewives.

08:37.360 --> 08:40.000
At 4:00 a.m. I go back home.

09:46.360 --> 09:47.840
-Have you fucked?
-No.

09:49.720 --> 09:52.080
Great, you rock.

09:52.160 --> 09:54.360
You're a black belt in avoiding life.

09:55.080 --> 09:56.160
Fifth-degree.

10:37.520 --> 10:42.320
THE END

10:51.000 --> 10:52.840
True, I'm a pro at dodging life

10:52.920 --> 10:54.840
because change makes me anxious.

10:54.920 --> 10:57.240
I'd like a life that's been embalmed.

10:57.320 --> 10:59.640
Sadly, the universe and taxidermy
do not get along.

10:59.720 --> 11:01.840
Every now and then, the universe behaves

11:01.920 --> 11:04.400
like an immature rude kid.

11:05.400 --> 11:08.440
The other night, outside the cinema,
I heard a voice…

11:08.520 --> 11:09.840
Is that you, Zero?

11:09.920 --> 11:12.560
I turned around and I saw this mouse girl.

11:12.640 --> 11:13.480
And I thought…

11:13.560 --> 11:14.800
I don't know you.

11:14.880 --> 11:16.640
I didn't say it out loud,

11:16.720 --> 11:18.600
but I guess she could tell.

11:19.640 --> 11:20.760
Because she said…

11:20.840 --> 11:24.520
Have you gone senile?
It's Valentina, you used to tutor me.

11:24.600 --> 11:28.360
Fuck, it's true!
She's one half of Two-Faced Mouse!

11:28.440 --> 11:32.040
Of course I remember!
Did you have surgery to get separated?

11:32.120 --> 11:35.200
Tell me about it.
Was it painful? Was it covered?

11:35.840 --> 11:37.240
Who are you talking about?

11:37.320 --> 11:39.640
Your friend! You were inseparable!

11:39.720 --> 11:41.520
You used to write, "You're my life!"

11:41.600 --> 11:43.640
"You're more than my sister!
You're my soulmate!"

11:43.720 --> 11:45.440
You squealed in unison!

11:46.320 --> 11:47.800
Do you mean Ludovica?

11:47.880 --> 11:50.920
That was until the summer,
then she spent July in Rapallo,

11:51.000 --> 11:53.760
while I went somewhere else with Mom,
so we lost contact.

11:54.400 --> 11:56.440
I let slide the teen concept of friendship

11:56.520 --> 11:59.240
and I try to make conversation.

11:59.320 --> 12:02.800
"Have you finished high school yet?
When are your finals?"

12:02.880 --> 12:05.280
Zero, I'm working now.

12:05.360 --> 12:08.040
And I think, "She wasn't the smartest…

12:09.280 --> 12:12.520
but she could have at least
scraped through her finals!"

12:12.600 --> 12:16.080
These tales of teen school dropouts
break my heart.

12:16.160 --> 12:18.600
Oh, I'm sorry. You weren't too gifted,

12:18.680 --> 12:19.880
but there are options.

12:19.960 --> 12:21.960
You could have picked a technical degree.

12:22.040 --> 12:23.960
I have a Literature degree!

12:24.040 --> 12:26.720
I work as an editor
for a publishing house.

12:33.240 --> 12:34.760
Wait, no, it can't be.

12:34.840 --> 12:38.440
This is like in <i>Interstellar,</i>
different timelines are mixed up.

12:39.440 --> 12:42.520
What do you mean, you have a job?
You were still in school!

12:42.600 --> 12:44.280
I blinked and now you work?

12:44.360 --> 12:46.280
That was ten years ago.

12:47.520 --> 12:49.840
This realization annihilates me.

12:49.920 --> 12:52.880
REALIZATION
ANGUISH ON CANVAS

12:54.080 --> 12:58.520
It's not so much the ten years.
That's just a cold number, who cares?

12:58.600 --> 13:00.320
It's the human side of it.

13:00.400 --> 13:03.000
This kid has grown up
and built herself a life.

13:03.080 --> 13:04.280
She's become someone.

13:04.360 --> 13:07.560
And that two-headed mouse

13:07.640 --> 13:10.720
is a long-forgotten memory
of a time long ago.

13:11.240 --> 13:13.000
And while she was changing,

13:13.080 --> 13:15.720
I feel like I haven't had time
to do a thing.

13:16.240 --> 13:18.360
How did you change your status?

13:18.440 --> 13:21.160
How have you become something
so inherently different

13:21.240 --> 13:24.600
while I'm still
that same lump of mucilage?

13:26.600 --> 13:28.680
Did your mom leave you alone with him?

13:28.760 --> 13:30.800
He wasn't like this. He hasn't aged well.

13:31.400 --> 13:32.880
This is not acceptable.

13:32.960 --> 13:36.960
The idea that someone younger than me
could hold a position of authority

13:37.040 --> 13:38.400
just fucks with my head.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.800
Once I went to a dentist
who was born in 1989 and I thought…

13:41.880 --> 13:44.560
Should I allow him to put
his hands in my mouth?

13:44.640 --> 13:47.760
What if he starts playing
with his action figures?

13:49.200 --> 13:51.800
Anyway, former Mouse Kid
looks at me with pity

13:51.880 --> 13:54.800
and then leaves me to ponder
on my frozen life.

13:54.880 --> 13:58.800
I realize that all that bewilderment
is borne out of a crucial error.

13:59.720 --> 14:03.200
For a while, I thought
that if I stopped tearing the paper

14:03.280 --> 14:05.720
and I kept everything still,

14:05.800 --> 14:07.840
at least I wouldn't risk any more damage.

14:08.360 --> 14:09.640
It doesn't work like that.

14:09.720 --> 14:13.040
If you keep that piece of paper
in your hand for ten years,

14:13.120 --> 14:15.320
it gets crumpled up anyway.

14:15.400 --> 14:18.920
Your hand gets sweaty,
or maybe you do some origami with it.

14:19.520 --> 14:23.040
In any case, ten years down the line,
it's completely ruined,

14:23.120 --> 14:25.160
even if you tried to keep still.

14:26.200 --> 14:27.720
I find some comfort in thinking

14:27.800 --> 14:30.160
that at least she's grown up normal.

14:30.240 --> 14:31.680
She has a job, she's fits in.

14:31.760 --> 14:33.320
She doesn't seem to be a Nazi,

14:33.400 --> 14:36.280
or at least she didn't get
a Nazi tattoo on her face.

14:36.360 --> 14:37.360
<i>Sieg Heil!</i>

14:37.440 --> 14:41.840
I can count her as my first success story,
educationally speaking.

14:41.920 --> 14:43.800
"You did a good job."

14:43.880 --> 14:47.880
I keep telling myself that because I need
some positive thoughts to hang on to.

14:54.600 --> 15:01.480
TODAY, 7:58 P.M.
BIELLA

15:09.960 --> 15:14.040
I do need some nice thoughts
because yes, everything is going well,

15:14.120 --> 15:16.840
although I smell of piss,
I'm covered in grease,

15:16.920 --> 15:18.320
sweaty as a kebab, and feel sick.

15:18.400 --> 15:21.720
But the hard part starts now
as we get to this old couple's home.

15:26.400 --> 15:29.360
I hate staying at someone's house
if I don't know them well.

15:29.440 --> 15:31.440
You can't behave
as if you were in a hotel…

15:31.520 --> 15:33.720
I just need the Wi-Fi password

15:33.800 --> 15:35.400
and the breakfast time.

15:35.480 --> 15:37.280
Now fuck off, please.

15:38.240 --> 15:41.560
You need to pay something
in exchange for a free bed.

15:41.640 --> 15:43.560
And the currency is being sociable.

15:44.960 --> 15:47.720
When you accept their offer to stay,

15:47.800 --> 15:50.680
you have tacitly given
these people the right

15:50.760 --> 15:54.640
to use your body,
and especially your ears, as they please.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.840
Now I'll pick a subject

15:57.920 --> 16:00.640
that you don't give a fuck about.

16:00.720 --> 16:03.760
For example, how to make tomato preserves.

16:04.440 --> 16:08.040
I will talk for so long
that your ears will start to bleed,

16:08.120 --> 16:10.280
and when you're about to die,
I'll rescue you

16:10.360 --> 16:13.200
with a little grappa
and some reheated meatballs.

16:13.280 --> 16:14.760
I'll slap your cheeks a bit,

16:14.840 --> 16:17.520
and then I'll start again
about the preserves.

16:17.600 --> 16:20.840
My husband has been a resuscitation tech
at a hospital for 40 years.

16:20.920 --> 16:22.920
He organizes courses for the CIA

16:23.000 --> 16:25.760
on how to interrogate prisoners
at Guantanamo.

16:26.280 --> 16:28.480
Nobody ever died on his watch,

16:28.560 --> 16:32.280
not even those who were begging
Jesus Christ to take them.

16:32.360 --> 16:35.320
They spoke with a Biella accent,
but I can't do that.

16:35.400 --> 16:36.720
That was the gist, though.

16:36.800 --> 16:39.560
We were hostages to their deluge of words.

16:40.600 --> 16:41.880
They're doing my head in.

16:41.960 --> 16:45.560
I feel like I've been in one
of those endless <i>Mortal Kombat</i> fights

16:45.640 --> 16:46.920
where you can't breathe

16:47.000 --> 16:49.920
and you can't stop
the endless barrage of punches.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.680
I'm off to bed, it was an early start.

16:52.760 --> 16:55.120
And then Sarah saves us all,

16:55.200 --> 16:58.840
like Noah pulling you back
on the ark just before you drown.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.440
Oh, Lord, of course!

17:01.520 --> 17:03.840
We must've kept you up
with all our chatting!

17:03.920 --> 17:06.480
We're just so happy you're here.

17:23.200 --> 17:24.600
We're in our room at last.

17:24.680 --> 17:27.360
Secco and I are sharing,
Sarah has got her own.

17:27.440 --> 17:29.560
We're ready, pajamas on.

17:29.640 --> 17:32.400
But then drama ensues. I have to pee.

17:37.720 --> 17:39.920
The bathroom is
on the other side of the house

17:40.000 --> 17:42.600
and I need to pass the sitting room,

17:42.680 --> 17:46.920
where the two zombies are waiting,
foaming at the mouth,

17:47.000 --> 17:50.040
for the river to bring them
another carcass to devour.

17:51.600 --> 17:52.680
In this metaphor,

17:52.760 --> 17:53.960
I am the carcass

17:54.040 --> 17:56.840
and the river is inside my bladder.

17:57.920 --> 17:58.920
Don't you have to pee?

17:59.000 --> 18:00.880
I'm not going back out there.

18:00.960 --> 18:03.240
I'll piss myself. It's not even my bed.

18:04.320 --> 18:06.600
I would subscribe to that idea

18:06.680 --> 18:08.400
if we weren't sharing a bed.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.400
Well, the day started
in a piss-filled bathroom,

18:12.480 --> 18:14.560
it's only fair it ends like this.

18:16.000 --> 18:16.880
I'm a prude,

18:16.960 --> 18:18.800
I can't even piss in the sea

18:18.880 --> 18:22.600
if there's another human two miles away,
let alone in my same bed!

18:22.680 --> 18:25.800
So I gather my strength
and enter the lion's den.

18:29.880 --> 18:32.880
Can't you sleep?
Do you want more meatballs?

18:32.960 --> 18:36.120
No, I just wanted to brush my teeth.
Don't you worry.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.040
So I think…

18:37.120 --> 18:40.080
She'll want to finish me off,
I bet she starts talking

18:40.160 --> 18:42.920
about how long you can store pasta…

18:43.000 --> 18:44.200
But no, she doesn't.

18:47.480 --> 18:51.640
Thank you so much.
It means a lot to us that you guys came.

18:51.720 --> 18:52.640
For Alice.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.760
In <i>Mortal Kombat</i> terms,

18:55.840 --> 18:58.360
this is the shoryuken that ends the fight.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.400
The husband doesn't even stand up
to try to help me.

19:17.920 --> 19:22.360
It's the first time tonight that someone
has said Alice's name out loud.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.440
Can you sleep?

19:39.520 --> 19:42.000
I can't sleep
with someone else in the bed.

19:42.080 --> 19:44.200
At least we're in the guest room.

19:44.280 --> 19:46.880
Poor Sarah is sleeping
in a dead girl's bed.

20:05.120 --> 20:09.840
ALICE'S LAIR
KNOCK

21:49.640 --> 21:51.960
