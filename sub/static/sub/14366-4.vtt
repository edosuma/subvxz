00:00.966 --> 00:02.867
<i>Previously on Transformers Prime...</i>

00:02.869 --> 00:07.572
<i>The specimen you see
before you was bred in the laboratory,</i>

00:07.574 --> 00:10.875
<i>cloned from fossilized remains,
which I discovered on Cybertron.</i>

00:10.877 --> 00:14.212
A dragon?
Where'd the 'Cons get a dragon?!

00:18.017 --> 00:19.884
<i>Ultra Magnus?</i>

00:19.886 --> 00:22.812
- It's an honor.
- "It's an honor, Sir."

00:23.056 --> 00:27.358
<i>We must stop Megatron.
With or without Optimus Prime.</i>

00:27.360 --> 00:32.563
- Who put shoulderpads in command?
- Ultra Magnus is the only logical choice.

00:32.564 --> 00:37.568
- Optimus! I have the forge!
- Whatever power remains...

00:37.570 --> 00:41.706
must be used to restore Cybertron.

00:41.708 --> 00:47.778
<i>The time for a new leader
is upon us.</i>

00:47.780 --> 00:50.628
I believe that leader...

00:50.629 --> 00:54.707
stands before me right now.

00:58.690 --> 01:02.026
<i>Autobots.
We remain vastly outnumbered,</i>

01:02.028 --> 01:05.930
and, despite our munitions,
do not currently possess the firepower

01:05.932 --> 01:09.767
necessary to compromise
the Decepticon citadel.

01:09.769 --> 01:12.803
Uncle Sam's military does.
I just can't let them make a move

01:12.805 --> 01:16.107
as long as Megatron's ray
guns are pointed at Washington.

01:16.109 --> 01:17.575
Then we must infiltrate Darkmount

01:17.577 --> 01:19.977
in order to nullify its fusion cannons.

01:19.979 --> 01:23.681
Unfortunately, it seems the
fortress is heavily shielded

01:23.683 --> 01:25.449
against unauthorized groundbridges.

01:25.451 --> 01:28.719
Even those originating
from Decepticon technology.

01:28.721 --> 01:33.090
Guess we'll have to sneak past
enemy lines. Wrecker-style.

01:33.092 --> 01:36.927
I couldn't deal with
"Wrecker-style" back on Cybertron,

01:36.929 --> 01:40.030
and I refuse to deal with it here.

01:40.032 --> 01:41.098
Hmm.

01:41.100 --> 01:43.518
Now, we require a means of thinning

01:43.519 --> 01:45.936
the Decepticon ranks to even the odds,

01:45.938 --> 01:49.907
If we're to have any hope
of completing this mission.

01:49.909 --> 01:51.008
Or of surviving it.

02:42.960 --> 02:45.120
I-I can't do this.

02:45.130 --> 02:48.060
I mean, sure, who
wouldn't wanna be a Prime?

02:48.060 --> 02:52.151
But I'm really not ready for
that kind of responsibility.

02:52.437 --> 02:55.130
Smokescreen...

02:55.140 --> 03:01.970
the choice is neither yours,
nor mine to make.

03:02.480 --> 03:04.080
When it is time...

03:04.080 --> 03:07.910
the Matrix of Leadership
will present itself

03:07.910 --> 03:13.490
only to one whose spark is worthy.

03:19.790 --> 03:23.160
Because it worked so well last time...

03:26.430 --> 03:31.740
I knew the humans couldn't resist
using their telecommunications.

03:31.740 --> 03:37.120
That is all they seem to do.
Seek and destroy!

03:40.480 --> 03:44.020
<i>I have five bogeys
converging right on top of Jack.</i>

03:44.020 --> 03:46.620
Not anymore.

03:52.020 --> 03:54.660
Miko, your turn.

03:54.960 --> 04:01.930
Hello, I need two large pies, Sicilian.
You deliver, right?

04:04.910 --> 04:09.740
Humans.
Standby to groundbridge.

04:11.810 --> 04:16.920
Soundwave, why can't you
accept a little good fortune?

04:16.920 --> 04:22.550
The Autobots couldn't
possibly stay hidden forever.

04:25.190 --> 04:27.090
I really could have used that pizza.

04:27.090 --> 04:31.560
I've tapped into the Decepticon
communications network.

04:31.570 --> 04:33.060
Are you ready, Jack?

04:34.170 --> 04:38.200
Decepticon command, do you read me?

04:38.940 --> 04:40.870
I remain unconvinced.

04:40.870 --> 04:43.540
I will enhance your
performance with static.

04:43.540 --> 04:46.780
<i>Decepticon command, do you read?</i>

04:46.780 --> 04:48.780
<i>We are under Autobot attack!</i>

04:48.780 --> 04:54.920
It's one of our Energon mines!
Insecticons, prepare for battle!

04:54.920 --> 04:58.260
Autobots, lock and load!

05:10.540 --> 05:12.140
<i>Keep your engines warm, boys.</i>

05:12.140 --> 05:16.510
We launch the moment
Ultra Magnus gives the all-clear.

05:30.020 --> 05:34.290
<i>There must be some mistake,
Commander Starscream.</i>

05:34.290 --> 05:36.060
<i>The mine is not under attack.</i>

05:36.060 --> 05:38.560
- What? How can that...?
- Starscream!

05:38.570 --> 05:42.630
Explain why my forces are
scattering across this globe.

05:42.640 --> 05:46.740
Uh, renegade Autobot
mischief, Lord Megatron!

05:46.740 --> 05:48.300
I am in the process of deducing

05:48.300 --> 05:51.780
how they are infiltrating our communications
systems without a base of...

05:53.840 --> 05:55.810
<i>The Harbinger!</i>

05:55.820 --> 05:59.280
You left abandoned Decepticon technology

05:59.290 --> 06:02.750
fully operational and unsecured?!

06:03.660 --> 06:07.930
Allow me to correct my
oversight immediately.

06:07.930 --> 06:11.200
<i>Seeker armada to the flight deck.</i>

06:14.230 --> 06:19.300
<i>Your target is the Decepticon
ship, the Harbinger.</i>

06:19.310 --> 06:22.490
You are to obliterate it, at once!

06:31.550 --> 06:33.950
My armada is in position.

06:33.950 --> 06:37.190
Open a groundbridge to the Harbinger.

06:41.230 --> 06:45.330
Since it would seem that
Darkmount is presently under attack,

06:45.330 --> 06:48.530
kindly redirect all
efforts toward ensuring

06:48.530 --> 06:51.840
that our invaders are eradicated!

06:52.470 --> 06:55.410
Fire in another hole!

07:41.920 --> 07:46.260
I assure you, master, I have
everything under control.

07:47.960 --> 07:50.630
Lord Megatron.

07:50.630 --> 07:54.800
I accept that military considerations
are outside of my domain,

07:54.800 --> 07:57.900
but perhaps it is once again time...

07:57.900 --> 08:01.540
to release the Predacon.

08:38.620 --> 08:41.690
Ratchet, now!

09:02.880 --> 09:04.980
Oh, well...

09:06.890 --> 09:12.220
Yes, that's right.
Go off and sulk, why don't you?

09:27.510 --> 09:32.680
- Who stands before me?
- What?

09:32.680 --> 09:36.810
It's me, Optimus.
Smokescreen.

09:36.820 --> 09:39.820
Who... beckons?

09:44.890 --> 09:48.590
<i>Come, Optimus.</i>

09:50.730 --> 09:52.680
Is it truly you...

09:54.770 --> 09:57.430
Alpha Trion?

09:57.670 --> 10:00.270
<i>I stand before you, my student.</i>

10:00.270 --> 10:05.480
<i>As such, it would seem
that it is your time.</i>

10:07.350 --> 10:09.310
Why do you hesitate?

10:09.320 --> 10:12.980
I do not fear joining with the Allspark,

10:12.990 --> 10:16.950
but for the fate
of the Matrix of Leadership.

10:16.960 --> 10:21.360
<i>You know as well as I,
a worthy candidate is near.</i>

10:21.360 --> 10:27.000
<i>One who will learn to be a Prime,
as you once did.</i>

10:29.570 --> 10:32.653
<i>Ultra Magnus to stealth team.</i>

10:32.814 --> 10:34.310
Status report.

10:34.310 --> 10:38.780
<i>Having a little
trouble reaching the objective.</i>

10:42.880 --> 10:46.720
Security is tighter
than anticipated, Sir.

10:46.720 --> 10:48.820
Keep them occupied.

11:18.080 --> 11:20.850
<i>Ultra Magnus.</i>

11:21.390 --> 11:23.520
Allow me to venture.

11:23.520 --> 11:29.830
You intend to disarm my fusion
cannons by disabling their power core.

11:29.830 --> 11:35.570
Indeed, Megatron, and you
are standing in my way.

12:02.890 --> 12:06.600
Your mission was most illogical.

12:20.300 --> 12:21.800
Scrap.

12:44.840 --> 12:46.840
Ultra Magnus.

12:46.840 --> 12:50.440
You are no Optimus Prime.

12:57.480 --> 13:02.020
What in the name of Paul Revere's
horse is taking them so long?!

13:06.515 --> 13:10.990
All invaders have been
taken captive, master.

13:11.000 --> 13:15.530
And there was no sign of Optimus Prime.

13:15.774 --> 13:19.340
So tell me, Commander...

13:19.340 --> 13:22.470
where might your leader be?

13:23.115 --> 13:27.340
<i>Take my hand, Optimus, and join me.</i>

13:27.350 --> 13:31.510
<i>Join with the Allspark.</i>

13:45.900 --> 13:48.330
Optimus, no!

13:59.440 --> 14:03.350
This isn't how the
story's supposed to end.

14:25.040 --> 14:28.440
I will not ask again!

14:28.440 --> 14:35.080
- If I knew, I wouldn't tell you.
- Very well.

14:35.080 --> 14:38.510
Execute our prisoners,
and fire each cannon

14:38.520 --> 14:42.020
at the nearest metropolis
within its sights.

14:42.020 --> 14:45.490
It is time to show the known universe

14:45.490 --> 14:50.590
- that this planet belongs to Megatron.
- Master, something's coming!

15:04.800 --> 15:10.150
- The Predacon!
- Not beasty enough.

15:17.420 --> 15:19.460
How is that possible?

15:19.460 --> 15:22.130
- What?
- An Autobot signal.

15:22.130 --> 15:28.100
- But it's airborne.
- I know that color scheme.

15:37.610 --> 15:40.910
Wait!
He can't fly! Can he?

16:11.380 --> 16:15.350
- Commander?
- Sir, you're looking... robust.

16:15.350 --> 16:18.980
It is paramount that we disable
the fusion cannons below.

16:19.210 --> 16:20.920
Understood.

16:25.320 --> 16:26.490
All units...

16:26.490 --> 16:29.560
<i>Optimus Prime has returned.</i>

16:29.560 --> 16:30.490
- Yes!
- Awesome!

16:30.500 --> 16:31.660
- Thank the Allspark!
- Sweet!

16:31.660 --> 16:36.000
<i>I repeat, Prime is alive and quite well.</i>

16:36.000 --> 16:38.000
Yes!

17:24.480 --> 17:27.450
<i>Optimus!</i>

17:47.950 --> 17:51.510
<i>Commander,
a cluster of enemy signals, incoming!</i>

17:51.720 --> 17:56.680
Humans.
Activate the fusion cannons!

18:01.350 --> 18:04.720
<i>Sky strikers, await my command.</i>

18:16.910 --> 18:21.300
Megatron, begone!

18:37.920 --> 18:40.960
Autobots, clear the area.

18:55.920 --> 18:57.780
Let's do this.

19:08.590 --> 19:13.420
Soundwave, I require a groundbridge.

19:25.140 --> 19:28.500
Transport Lord Megatron to the warship.

19:28.510 --> 19:32.070
What are you doing?
No! We will not retreat!

19:32.080 --> 19:35.480
This battle is lost, my liege.
We must retreat

19:35.480 --> 19:39.520
if we are to have any
hope of winning the war.

19:48.930 --> 19:51.760
Aw, I missed it!

20:15.520 --> 20:19.490
<i>On behalf of the President
and the joint chiefs,</i>

20:19.490 --> 20:23.590
<i>I thank you all for your selfless
heroism in defense of this planet.</i>

20:23.600 --> 20:27.960
<i>I'm only sorry that the world can't
yet know of your undying dedication,</i>

20:27.970 --> 20:35.940
<i>because I, for one, owe you my
life, my liberty, and my future.</i>

20:38.180 --> 20:44.150
Sir, I am honored to relinquish
command of the Autobots to you.

20:44.150 --> 20:52.120
Welcome to Earth, Ultra Magnus.
And to team Prime.

20:52.490 --> 20:56.560
Okay, someone's gotta say it.
Optimus 2.0 is rad!

20:56.560 --> 21:00.230
Imagine what the forge
could do for your bod.

21:02.130 --> 21:08.070
<i>Is it true that the Forge
has been drained of its power?</i>

21:08.970 --> 21:14.140
Then any hope of rebuilding the
Omega lock has truly been lost.

21:14.150 --> 21:17.180
I did what I felt was right.

21:17.180 --> 21:21.550
And your instincts have again
proven to be quite sound.

21:29.730 --> 21:31.990
<i> Yeah!</i>
