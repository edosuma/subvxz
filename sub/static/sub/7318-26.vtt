WEBVTT

00:16.333 --> 00:18.633
(Meredith) HUMAN BEINGS
NEED A LOT OF THINGS

00:18.667 --> 00:21.300
TO FEEL ALIVE...

00:21.333 --> 00:22.733
(George) FAMILY...

00:22.767 --> 00:24.700
(Cristina) LOVE...

00:24.733 --> 00:26.433
(Izzie) SEX.

00:26.467 --> 00:28.367
(Derek)
BUT WE ONLY NEED ONE THING...

00:28.400 --> 00:31.400
(Preston)
TO ACTUALLY BE ALIVE.

00:32.767 --> 00:36.767
(Cristina)
WE NEED A BEATING HEART.

00:36.800 --> 00:39.133
(Addison)
WHEN OUR HEART IS THREATENED...

00:39.167 --> 00:43.433
(Alex) WE RESPOND
IN ONE OF TWO WAYS...

00:43.467 --> 00:45.433
(George) WE EITHER RUN...

00:45.467 --> 00:47.167
(Derek) OR...

00:47.200 --> 00:50.267
(Izzie) WE ATTACK.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.100
(Richard) THERE'S
A SCIENTIFIC TERM FOR THIS...

00:52.133 --> 00:54.033
(Alex) FIGHT...

00:54.067 --> 00:56.100
(Addison) OR FLIGHT.

00:56.133 --> 00:57.767
(Miranda) IT'S INSTINCT.

00:57.800 --> 01:00.733
(mouthing words)

01:02.600 --> 01:04.700
(Meredith)
WE CAN'T CONTROL IT.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.500
(monitor beeps)

01:08.533 --> 01:09.733
(Izzie) OR CAN WE?

01:09.767 --> 01:11.433
(George) IZZIE.

01:11.467 --> 01:14.067
(monitor beeping erratically)

01:14.067 --> 01:16.133
HIS HEART'S BARELY BEATING.

01:16.167 --> 01:18.300
WE NEED TO CALL A CODE.

01:18.333 --> 01:20.667
I CAN'T FEEL A PULSE.
IZZIE, WE NEED TO CALL A CODE.

01:20.700 --> 01:23.300
NO! I HAVE A PLAN.
HE'S CRASHING.
I NEED TO CALL THE CODE.

01:23.333 --> 01:26.500
NO! IF WE CALL A CODE,
THEY WILL RUSH HIM TO SURGERY

01:26.533 --> 01:28.467
AND REPLACE HIS LVAD,
AND THEN HE WILL STABILIZE.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.433
HE NEEDS TO GET WORSE
IF HE'S GONNA GET THIS HEART.

01:30.467 --> 01:32.233
IZZIE, THIS IS CRAZY.

01:32.267 --> 01:33.467
HE HAS TO GET THIS HEART.
HE WILL DIE WAITING

01:33.500 --> 01:35.400
FOR ANOTHER CHANCE.
YOU KNOW HE WILL.

01:35.433 --> 01:37.467
WE HAVE TO CALL A CODE!
NO!

01:37.500 --> 01:40.233
YOU PRESS THAT CODE BUTTON,
I WILL HURT YOU.

01:40.267 --> 01:41.833
NOT A LOT,
'CAUSE WE'RE FRIENDS,

01:41.867 --> 01:43.267
BUT ENOUGH SO THAT
THINGS WILL BREAK,

01:43.300 --> 01:46.200
AND YOU LIE ON THE FLOOR
OUT OF MY WAY.
IZZIE...

01:46.233 --> 01:47.767
YOU HAVE A DECISION TO MAKE.

01:47.800 --> 01:49.700
YOU CAN STAY HERE
AND HELP ME WITH THIS,

01:49.733 --> 01:51.567
OR YOU CAN GO.

01:51.600 --> 01:53.567
WHAT'S IT GONNA BE, GEORGE?

01:53.600 --> 01:55.500
(siren wailing)

01:55.533 --> 01:57.433
CHIEF, HOW BAD IS IT?
IT LOOKS BAD.

01:57.467 --> 01:59.367
UM, I'M HERE. I CAN HELP.

01:59.400 --> 02:01.300
UM, IF THERE'S
ANYTHING SURGICAL, I CAN HELP.

02:01.333 --> 02:02.433
WHY DON'T YOU GO RUN
TRAUMA TWO, DOCTOR YANG?

02:02.467 --> 02:04.367
I GET TO RUN TRAUMA TWO,
ALL BY MYSELF?

02:04.400 --> 02:06.300
YES, BUT FIND ME
IF YOU NEED HELP

02:06.333 --> 02:08.233
AND GET CONSULTS.
I'M ON IT.

02:08.267 --> 02:11.267
(siren wailing)

02:13.700 --> 02:15.167
(Richard) HOW BAD IS IT?

02:15.200 --> 02:17.100
UH, G.S.W.
TO THE RIGHT SHOULDER.

02:17.133 --> 02:19.067
HE'S LOST A LOT OF BLOOD.

02:19.067 --> 02:20.800
ALL RIGHT,
GET HIM TO TRAUMA ONE.

02:20.833 --> 02:24.400
AND KEEP THE BLINDS CLOSED.
YANG IS ON THE FLOOR.

02:24.433 --> 02:26.333
SELF-INFLICTED G.S.W.
TO THE HEAD. PULSE IS THREADY.

02:26.367 --> 02:28.067
THIS GUY'S THE SHOOTER?

02:28.067 --> 02:29.800
YEP, EMPTIED HIS CLIP
THEN SHOT HIMSELF.

02:29.833 --> 02:31.733
AND BLEW OFF HALF HIS HEAD.

02:31.767 --> 02:34.667
OKAY, OKAY. UM, PUSH 1 OF EPI
AND, UH, GET HIM ON A MONITOR.

02:34.700 --> 02:36.833
YOU'RE RUNNING THIS?
DAMN RIGHT I AM.

02:36.867 --> 02:38.533
WAIT, WAIT.

02:38.567 --> 02:39.633
I'M--I'M FINE.

02:39.667 --> 02:42.367
YOU NEED TO LAY DOWN.
YOU'VE LOST A LOT OF BLOOD.

02:42.400 --> 02:44.300
I'M FINE. L-LET GO.
I'M FINE.

02:44.333 --> 02:46.267
I HAVE A PATIENT
I HAVE TO GO CHECK ON.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.400
NO, NO, NO.
YOU ARE THE PATIENT. LAY DOWN.

02:50.167 --> 02:52.233
(chuckles)

02:52.267 --> 02:55.067
DR. BAILEY,
WHEN DID YOU GET HERE?

02:55.067 --> 02:56.400
PAGE SHEPHERD.

02:56.433 --> 02:58.833
(Miranda) OKAY.

02:58.867 --> 03:02.067
(monitor beeping erratically)

03:09.333 --> 03:12.500
TAKE OVER COMPRESSIONS.

03:21.100 --> 03:22.833
YOU'RE SHOT?
CRISTINA?

03:22.867 --> 03:24.733
(Richard) CRISTINA,
GET BACK TO YOUR PATIENT!
HE'S SHOT?

03:24.767 --> 03:27.700
YANG, WE GOT THIS, OKAY?
THAT GUY SHOT YOU.

03:27.733 --> 03:29.733
MOVE.
HE'S A LOST CAUSE.

03:29.767 --> 03:31.633
MOVE.
HE'S CIRCLING THE DRAIN.

03:31.667 --> 03:34.467
YOU DON'T GET TO KILL YOURSELF.
YOU DO NOT GET OFF THAT EASILY.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.300
PUSH HIGH DOSE EPI.
DR. YANG--

03:36.333 --> 03:38.233
WHAT?! I WANT TO BE ABLE
TO TELL HIS FAMILY

03:38.267 --> 03:40.167
THAT I DID EVERYTHING I COULD
TO SAVE HIS PATHETIC,

03:40.200 --> 03:41.200
MISERABLE LIFE.

03:41.233 --> 03:43.433
GIVE HIM 3 OF EPI, NOW.

03:45.800 --> 03:50.133
WE SHOULD BE HEARING
FROM DR. BURKE ANY MINUTE.

03:50.167 --> 03:54.067
(scoffs) THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID
HALF AN HOUR AGO.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.067
WELL, WHETHER OR NOT
WE HEAR FROM HIM,

03:56.067 --> 03:59.433
WE HIT THAT HOUR MARK,
I'M GOIN' IN TO GET MY HEART.

04:04.133 --> 04:06.067
OKAY, NO. NO EXIT WOUND.

04:06.067 --> 04:07.800
ENTRY TO THE UPPER
RIGHT SHOULDER.

04:07.833 --> 04:09.633
COULD BE LODGED
IN THE SPINE.

04:09.667 --> 04:11.167
(Preston groans)
OKAY, LET'S ROLL HIM OVER.

04:11.200 --> 04:12.600
(Richard) EASY.

04:12.633 --> 04:13.600
OKAY, WATCH THE ARM.
EASY.

04:13.633 --> 04:15.200
HEY, DR. BURKE.
HMM?

04:15.233 --> 04:17.133
THE BULLET IS IN DANGEROUS
PROPERTY HERE, OKAY?

04:17.167 --> 04:18.600
WE NEED TO CHECK
YOUR HAND FUNCTION.

04:18.633 --> 04:22.333
I WANT YOU TO TRY
AND SQUEEZE MY FINGERS, OKAY?

04:25.300 --> 04:26.400
THEY MOVED MY GUY UPSTAIRS.
HOW IS HE?

04:26.433 --> 04:28.400
I NEED YOU TO WAIT OUTSIDE.
I'M NOT GONNA WAIT OUTSIDE.

04:28.433 --> 04:30.400
BURKE?

04:31.467 --> 04:33.367
CAN WE HAVE A MOMENT?

04:34.767 --> 04:37.067
(Richard) ONLY A MOMENT.

04:37.100 --> 04:39.733
I DON'T WANT TO WASTE
ANY TIME, OKAY?

04:39.767 --> 04:41.700
OH, CRISTINA...

04:41.733 --> 04:43.500
NO, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING.

04:43.533 --> 04:44.567
I KNOW YOU'RE SORRY.

04:44.600 --> 04:47.367
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T MEAN
TO KICK ME OFF THE TRANSPLANT,

04:47.400 --> 04:49.400
AND I'M NOT MAD.

04:49.433 --> 04:51.333
I MEAN, I WAS,
BUT I'M NOT ANYMORE.

04:51.367 --> 04:54.333
SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT, OKAY?

04:54.367 --> 04:57.233
I MEAN, ALL THAT MATTERS
IS THAT YOU GET BETTER,

04:57.267 --> 04:59.800
AND YOU GET THROUGH THIS.

04:59.833 --> 05:04.600
AND I'M HERE FOR YOU--
WHATEVER YOU NEED, ANYTHING.

05:06.500 --> 05:08.367
I NEED...

05:08.400 --> 05:09.467
YOU TO...

05:09.500 --> 05:11.367
TO GO...
UH-HUH.

05:11.400 --> 05:15.433
TO CHECK ON DENNY DUQUETTE.

05:17.367 --> 05:18.700
OKAY.

05:18.733 --> 05:21.067
MM-HMM.

05:21.100 --> 05:22.833
(whispers) THAT WAS MY BEST
SUPPORTIVE GIRLFRIEND,

05:22.867 --> 05:24.767
AND YOU KIND OF RUINED IT
WITH MEDICINE.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.167
OKAY.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.600
MM.

05:27.633 --> 05:30.567
ADDISON!
THANK YOU FOR MEETING US.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.500
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT'S SO IMPORTANT

05:32.533 --> 05:34.633
I'M KEEPING IT SECRET
FROM MY CHIEF OF SURGERY?

05:34.667 --> 05:36.567
I WAS CHAPERONING A PROM
FOR MY NIECE.

05:36.600 --> 05:39.267
WE HAD A LITTLE BIT
OF A SITUATION.

05:39.300 --> 05:41.100
CAMILLE TRAVIS, 17,

05:41.133 --> 05:43.433
LOST CONSCIOUSNESS
DURING SEXUAL INTERCOURSE?

05:43.467 --> 05:44.833
KEEP IT DOWN!

05:44.867 --> 05:47.633
IT'S OKAY, AUNT ADELE.
I'M FINE.

05:47.667 --> 05:48.833
WHEN YOUR UNCLE RICHARD
FINDS OUT

05:48.867 --> 05:50.700
YOU WERE
CASHING IN YOUR V-CARD,

05:50.733 --> 05:52.633
NONE OF US WILL BE FINE.
(girl) CAMILLE?
(girl) MRS. WEBBER?

05:52.667 --> 05:54.567
OH, MY GOD. IS SHE OKAY?
SHE HAS TO BE OKAY, RIGHT?

05:54.600 --> 05:56.500
NO ONE EVER DIED
HAVING SEX, RIGHT?
IT WAS HER FIRST TIME.

05:56.533 --> 05:58.333
YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL
MY PARENTS, RIGHT?

05:58.367 --> 06:01.200
HEY, I EVEN USED A CONDOM
AND EVERYTHING.

06:01.233 --> 06:02.567
(sighs)

06:06.100 --> 06:07.833
GEORGE'S PAGE SAID IT WAS
AN EMERGENCY. WHAT'S GOING ON?

06:07.867 --> 06:09.300
YOU PAGED MEREDITH?

06:09.333 --> 06:11.267
WE NEED HELP!
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

06:11.300 --> 06:13.067
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?
EXACTLY WHAT I SAID.

06:13.100 --> 06:14.533
(George) SHE CUT
HIS LVAD WIRES.

06:14.567 --> 06:17.100
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU CUT HIS LVAD WIRES?

06:17.133 --> 06:19.067
ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL HIM?
I'M TRYING TO SAVE HIM.

06:19.067 --> 06:21.367
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS CONFIRM
THAT HIS CONDITION IS WORSE,

06:21.400 --> 06:23.400
AND THEN BURKE
CAN CALL U.N.O.S.

06:23.433 --> 06:26.200
AND HE'LL MOVE UP ON THE LIST,
AND HE WILL GET HIS HEART.
ABOUT BURKE--

06:26.233 --> 06:28.400
SHE'S GONE INSANE, RIGHT?
IT'S NOT JUST ME?
ABOUT BURKE--

06:28.433 --> 06:29.833
EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE!
IZZIE.

06:29.867 --> 06:32.800
WHEN BURKE GETS HERE,
EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.

06:32.833 --> 06:34.667
HE WILL KNOW WHAT TO DO.
ABOUT BURKE--

06:34.700 --> 06:35.600
WHAT?!
HE'S BEEN SHOT.

06:45.700 --> 06:47.833
BURKE'S NOT COMING?

06:47.867 --> 06:49.167
CRISTINA, ARE YOU OKAY?
I'M FINE, I'M FINE.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.467
BURKE'S NOT COMING?
WHY DIDN'T I TAKE
THE INTERNSHIP IN SAN DIEGO?

06:51.500 --> 06:53.400
NONE OF THIS WOULD BE HAPPENING
IF I WAS IN SAN DIEGO.

06:53.433 --> 06:56.400
BURKE'S NOT COMING?
NO, IZZIE,
BURKE IS NOT COMING.

06:56.433 --> 06:58.300
I KNOW YOU'RE HAVING
PROBLEMS HERE,

06:58.333 --> 07:00.400
WHAT, WITH YOUR POSSIBLE
MURDER CHARGES

07:00.433 --> 07:02.567
AND YOUR UNBELIEVABLY STUPID
IDEA ABOUT STEALING A HEART,

07:02.600 --> 07:04.767
BUT BURKE'S KINDA BUSY
RIGHT NOW.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.133
(Izzie)
DENNY'S GONNA DIE.

07:06.167 --> 07:08.200
DENNY'S GONNA DIE,
AND I KILLED HIM.

07:08.233 --> 07:09.833
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT!
(Meredith) GEORGE.

07:09.867 --> 07:11.667
WE HAVE TO TELL SOMEONE.
NO, DENNY WON'T GET
THE HEART,

07:11.700 --> 07:13.167
AND IZZIE WILL GET KICKED OUT
OF THE PROGRAM.
I'M LEAVING.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.433
WHAT?
CRISTINA!

07:14.467 --> 07:15.633
NO, BURKE COULD DIE, TOO.

07:15.667 --> 07:17.500
COMPLICATIONS ARISE ALL THE TIME
BECAUSE OF GUNSHOT WOUNDS.

07:17.533 --> 07:20.367
YOU THINK ABOUT THAT.
OH, MY GOD.

07:20.400 --> 07:21.733
OH, GOD, YOU KNOW WHAT?
NONE OF THIS WOULD'VE HAPPENED

07:21.767 --> 07:23.667
IF YOU WERE THINKING
WITH YOUR HEAD.
I DID WHAT I THOUGHT
WAS BEST!

07:23.700 --> 07:25.533
DID YOU THINK ABOUT THE RULES,
IZZIE, FOR ONE SECOND?

07:25.567 --> 07:28.200
THE RULES DON'T ALWAYS MATTER!
ABOUT ANYONE
OTHER THAN YOURSELF?!

07:28.233 --> 07:30.767
SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP!

07:30.800 --> 07:34.133
NO ONE IS LEAVING
AND NO ONE IS DYING.

07:34.167 --> 07:35.633
(Denny) THANK YOU.

07:35.667 --> 07:37.567
IT WAS KINDA GETTIN'
ON MY NERVES,

07:37.600 --> 07:40.133
ALL THIS DYING TALK.

07:40.167 --> 07:41.400
DENNY...

07:41.433 --> 07:42.700
IT'S OKAY.

07:42.733 --> 07:47.100
I THINK, UH, MAYBE WE SHOULD
ALL LISTEN TO MEREDITH.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.600
IT LOOKS LIKE
SHE MIGHT HAVE A PLAN.

07:48.633 --> 07:50.567
YOU HAVE A PLAN?

07:50.600 --> 07:52.367
JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE.

07:54.867 --> 07:56.767
YOU GIRLS SHOULD GO BACK
TO THE PROM.

07:56.800 --> 07:59.767
ARE YOU GONNA CALL
CAMILLE'S PARENTS?
NOT UNTIL I HAVE TO.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.467
YOU KNOW HER MOM.

08:01.500 --> 08:04.067
SHE GETS
A LITTLE HYSTERICAL.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.700
OH... BRIAN, DISAPPEAR.

08:05.733 --> 08:07.800
WHAT?
DISAPPEAR! GO. GET--

08:07.833 --> 08:10.133
RICHARD. RICHARD.

08:10.167 --> 08:11.367
ADELE.

08:11.400 --> 08:14.400
UM... WHAT, ARE YOU HERE
TO SEE PRESTON?

08:14.433 --> 08:16.833
PRESTON? NO.
WHAT HAPPENED TO PRESTON?

08:16.867 --> 08:19.167
PRESTON WAS SHOT.
PRESTON WAS SHOT?

08:19.200 --> 08:20.200
YEAH.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.733
CAMILLE?

08:21.767 --> 08:23.100
WHAT--WHAT HAPPENED
TO CAMILLE?
RICHARD--

08:23.133 --> 08:24.633
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL ME?

08:24.667 --> 08:26.633
SHE'S 17, SWEETHEART.
SHE'LL BE 18 IN A FEW MONTHS.

08:26.667 --> 08:29.300
MOST GIRLS
LOSE IT WAY BEFORE--
UNH-UNH-UNH.

08:29.333 --> 08:30.700
DO YOU THINK
I WANT TO HEAR THAT?

08:30.733 --> 08:33.367
YOU THINK I WANT TO PICTURE
MY BABY NIECE...

08:33.400 --> 08:34.233
(whispers) LOSING IT?

08:34.267 --> 08:36.300
RICHARD, RICHARD.
TAKE DEEP BREATHS.

08:36.333 --> 08:37.833
THE BLEEDING HAS STOPPED,

08:37.867 --> 08:39.367
BUT HER PELVIC EXAM
DOES CONCERN ME.

08:39.400 --> 08:42.067
I'D LIKE TO DO AN ULTRASOUND.

08:42.067 --> 08:45.333
THREE YEARS AGO, CAMILLE WAS
DIAGNOSED WITH OVARIAN CANCER.

08:45.367 --> 08:49.067
THEY ONLY REMOVED ONE OVARY
TO TRY AND PRESERVE FERTILITY.

08:49.067 --> 08:50.800
BUT HER CHECKUPS HAVE BEEN
CLEAN SINCE THEN.

08:50.833 --> 08:52.500
(Addison) OKAY.

08:52.533 --> 08:56.300
WELL, LET'S NOT WORRY
UNTIL WE HAVE TO.

08:56.333 --> 08:58.733
(Adele sighs)

09:01.133 --> 09:03.067
YOU! YOU WAIT RIGHT THERE.
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

09:03.067 --> 09:04.133
(mouths word)
I SAID WAIT.

09:04.167 --> 09:05.467
STOP! I SAID STOP!

09:05.500 --> 09:07.733
RICHARD, TAKE DEEP BREATHS.
RICHARD!

09:07.767 --> 09:09.333
OH, THAT'S A STUPID PLAN.

09:09.367 --> 09:11.600
WELL, IF BURKE ISN'T COMING,
THEN WE HAVE TO CONFIRM

09:11.633 --> 09:13.633
DENNY'S CONDITION OURSELVES.
WE GET THE BLOOD WORK,

09:13.667 --> 09:14.800
WE DO THE ECHO,

09:14.833 --> 09:17.567
AND NO ONE EVEN HAS TO KNOW
WHAT IZZIE DID.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.467
BUT NONE OF US HAVE DONE
AN ECHO ON OUR OWN BEFORE.

09:19.500 --> 09:21.733
CRISTINA HAS.
BURKE TAUGHT HER.

09:21.767 --> 09:23.533
I'M NOT INVOLVED.

09:23.567 --> 09:26.367
WHAT IF THIS WERE BURKE?
WHAT IF YOU WERE ME?
THIS IS BAD.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.067
THIS IS BAD AND SERIOUS
AND AGAINST A LOT OF RULES.

09:29.100 --> 09:31.200
IT'S NOT FUN FOR ME.
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY.
WHAT IF YOU WERE ME?

09:31.233 --> 09:33.733
WELL, I WOULDN'T HAVE FALLEN
IN LOVE WITH A PATIENT.
YOU FELL IN LOVE
WITH AN ATTENDING.

09:33.767 --> 09:36.733
WELL, SO DID MER.
WHAT'S THE POINT?
THE POINT IS WE CAN'T HELP
WHO WE FALL IN LOVE WITH.

09:36.767 --> 09:38.633
YEAH.

09:38.667 --> 09:40.200
YEAH.

09:43.067 --> 09:46.067
(monitors beeping)

09:48.333 --> 09:50.467
HAND'S COLD.

09:50.500 --> 09:53.167
MY HANDS ARE ALWAYS COLD.

09:53.200 --> 09:54.733
YOUR HAND IS COLD, PRESTON.

09:54.767 --> 09:56.167
I HAVE COLD HANDS.

09:56.200 --> 09:57.667
THANK YOU.

09:57.700 --> 09:59.567
(Preston coughs)

09:59.600 --> 10:01.033
MM.

10:01.067 --> 10:02.500
(sighs)

10:02.533 --> 10:04.567
THE BULLET COULD BE LODGED
IN THE BRACHIAL PLEXUS.

10:04.600 --> 10:06.733
THAT'S DANGEROUS.
YEAH, IT'S VERY DANGEROUS.

10:06.767 --> 10:09.767
COULD BE PRESSING AGAINST
THE NERVES.
MY HANDS ARE ALWAYS COLD.

10:09.800 --> 10:12.100
I'M ALWAYS COLD.

10:12.133 --> 10:13.167
(monitor beeping erratically)

10:13.200 --> 10:15.367
(Preston breathing raspily)

10:15.400 --> 10:18.233
OH, NO. TRACHEA'S DEVIATED
TO THE LEFT.

10:18.267 --> 10:19.833
GIVE ME BETADINE.
ABSENT BREATH SOUNDS
ON THE RIGHT SIDE.

10:19.867 --> 10:21.767
LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GO.
14 GAGE ANGIO.

10:21.800 --> 10:22.833
LET'S HURRY.

10:22.867 --> 10:25.733
(Preston groans)

10:25.767 --> 10:27.600
DR. BURKE. DR. BURKE,
YOU GOTTA STAY WITH ME NOW.

10:27.633 --> 10:29.533
(coughs)
THERE YOU GO. THAT'S IT.

10:29.567 --> 10:31.233
THERE YOU GO.
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

10:31.267 --> 10:33.167
RIGHT HERE, RIGHT HERE.
YOUR LUNG COLLAPSED.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.300
YOU'RE OKAY.

10:36.333 --> 10:38.400
YOU'RE OKAY NOW.

10:40.167 --> 10:43.133
HE'S BEEN SHOT? DUDE...

10:43.167 --> 10:45.667
We're gonna have to run
these tests ourselves.

10:45.700 --> 10:47.067
U.N.O.S. GAVE US AN HOUR.

10:47.100 --> 10:49.533
IN A COUPLE OF MINUTES,
OUR TIME IS UP.

10:49.567 --> 10:52.433
I'm telling you, this chick is
hard-core. She's not gonna wait.

10:52.467 --> 10:54.567
OKAY, WELL, YOU JUST
HAVE TO STALL HER.
I'm not getting involved
with this.

10:54.600 --> 10:56.267
LOOK, I DON'T CARE IF THAT--

10:56.300 --> 10:58.267
THAT DRAWLING, BEDRIDDEN WHINER
EVER GETS A HEART.
Alex...

10:58.300 --> 11:00.067
DO THIS...

11:00.100 --> 11:03.167
for Izzie.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.167
I'M NOT GUARANTEEING ANYTHING.

11:05.200 --> 11:07.233
(girl) SO...

11:07.267 --> 11:09.167
WAS IT TOTALLY ROMANTIC?

11:09.200 --> 11:11.767
YEAH, BEFORE THE PAIN

11:11.800 --> 11:13.500
AND THE PARAMEDICS
AND EVERYTHING?

11:13.533 --> 11:14.700
(girls giggle)

11:14.733 --> 11:16.467
OKAY, SO...

11:16.500 --> 11:18.400
(lowers voice)
YOU KNOW THAT FEELING

11:18.433 --> 11:21.433
WHEN YOU LOOK
INTO SOMEONE'S EYES

11:21.467 --> 11:23.333
AND YOU'RE
TOTALLY COMFORTABLE,

11:23.367 --> 11:27.233
AND YOU AREN'T SELF-CONSCIOUS,
AND EVERYTHING JUST...

11:27.267 --> 11:29.300
IS, LIKE, PERFECT?

11:29.333 --> 11:31.067
(girls laugh)

11:31.067 --> 11:32.800
CAMILLE, HAVE YOU HAD
ANY SYMPTOMS?

11:32.833 --> 11:36.067
UM, ANY ABDOMINAL PAIN,
NAUSEA?

11:36.067 --> 11:38.067
ANYTHING?

11:38.100 --> 11:39.767
(girl) NO, SHE'S BEEN FINE.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.600
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN FINE,
HAVE YOU?

11:44.300 --> 11:46.200
NO, NOT FOR LIKE
A MONTH OR SO.

11:46.233 --> 11:49.267
YOU'VE BEEN FEELING SICK
FOR A MONTH?

11:49.300 --> 11:52.500
I WANTED TO GO TO PROM.
I-I...

11:52.533 --> 11:56.067
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE
THE GIRL WITH CANCER AGAIN.

11:56.067 --> 11:57.200
YOU'RE NOT.

11:57.233 --> 12:00.067
SHE'S NOT, RIGHT?

12:10.633 --> 12:12.200
HEY.

12:12.233 --> 12:14.367
OH.

12:14.400 --> 12:18.133
I WAS JUST TRYING TO REMEMBER
THE NIGHT I LOST MY VIRGINITY.

12:18.167 --> 12:18.800
(chuckles)

12:18.833 --> 12:21.133
AND I CAN'T.

12:21.167 --> 12:22.633
MM.

12:22.667 --> 12:25.700
I REMEMBER
WHO IT WAS WITH AND...

12:25.733 --> 12:27.367
MM-HMM.

12:27.400 --> 12:29.500
I REMEMBER I WAS 18,

12:29.533 --> 12:33.567
BUT... I CAN'T REMEMBER
ANY OF THE DETAILS.

12:33.600 --> 12:36.600
I CAN REMEMBER
ALL OF THE DETAILS.

12:36.633 --> 12:38.167
I KINDA WISH I COULDN'T.

12:38.200 --> 12:39.367
THAT BAD?

12:39.400 --> 12:41.300
NO. JUST NOT GOOD.

12:41.333 --> 12:44.200
GOOD CAME LATER.

12:44.233 --> 12:46.567
AND THEN REALLY GOOD CAME.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.800
(laughs)

12:48.833 --> 12:51.767
(sighs)

12:51.800 --> 12:55.233
THAT LITTLE GIRL IN THERE
IS JUST GETTIN' STARTED.

12:55.267 --> 13:00.533
SHE HASN'T EVEN SEEN
WHAT GOOD IS YET.

13:01.600 --> 13:05.300
PLEASE, ADDISON...

13:05.333 --> 13:08.633
TELL ME SHE'S GOING TO HAVE
A CHANCE

13:08.667 --> 13:11.800
TO SEE
WHAT THE GOOD STUFF IS.

13:15.067 --> 13:17.700
OH.

13:17.733 --> 13:20.433
I'M SO SORRY, ADELE.

13:20.467 --> 13:23.467
***

13:25.100 --> 13:26.267
HOW'S HIS HEART LOOKING?

13:26.300 --> 13:27.800
HIS LEFT VENTRICLE'S SHOT.

13:27.833 --> 13:30.667
IT IS BARELY
PUSHING BLOOD OUT.

13:30.700 --> 13:32.067
I'M SORRY.

13:32.100 --> 13:33.667
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT BURKE.

13:33.700 --> 13:35.367
YOU KNOW, WHATEVER.
IT'S FINE.

13:37.500 --> 13:40.633
CRISTINA, CAN'T YOU
JUST TRY TO UNDERSTAND?

13:40.667 --> 13:43.500
I LOVE HIM.

13:43.533 --> 13:45.233
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HIM.

13:45.267 --> 13:47.233
I DO KNOW HIM.
NO, YOU'VE NEVER EVEN
SEEN HIM

13:47.267 --> 13:49.433
OUTSIDE THE FOUR WALLS
OF THIS HOSPITAL.

13:49.467 --> 13:51.133
YOU DON'T KNOW HIM.

13:51.167 --> 13:53.067
I KNOW HIM.
AND MAYBE I DON'T LIVE WITH HIM

13:53.100 --> 13:54.400
OR WORK WITH HIM LIKE YOU DO
WITH BURKE,

13:54.433 --> 13:55.767
BUT I DO KNOW HIM.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.300
AND THERE'S...

13:57.333 --> 14:00.700
THERE'S POSSIBILITY HERE.

14:00.733 --> 14:02.100
AND--AND GIVEN THE CHOICE

14:02.133 --> 14:03.767
OF RUNNING OR STAYING--

14:03.800 --> 14:05.300
YOU SHOULD RUN.

14:05.333 --> 14:07.500
A SANE PERSON,
A PERSON WHO VALUES HER CAREER

14:07.533 --> 14:09.433
AND EVERYTHING
SHE'S WORKED FOR,

14:09.467 --> 14:12.267
A PERSON WHO VALUES
HER OWN HEART, FOR GOD'S SAKE,

14:12.300 --> 14:14.500
THAT PERSON WOULD RUN.

14:14.533 --> 14:16.733
A SANE PERSON...

14:16.767 --> 14:18.200
WOULD MARRY ME.

14:19.867 --> 14:22.600
WHAT?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

14:22.633 --> 14:24.367
WHAT DID HE SAY?

14:26.733 --> 14:28.800
HE SAID, "MARRY ME"?

14:28.833 --> 14:31.400
HE SAID, "MARRY ME", RIGHT?
HE DID.

14:31.433 --> 14:33.467
DENNY, WAKE UP. DENNY.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.133
(monitor beeping erratically)

14:35.167 --> 14:36.467
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

14:36.500 --> 14:38.567
I'M PUMPING HARDER.
I DON'T KNOW.

14:38.600 --> 14:41.200
(beeping continues)

14:41.233 --> 14:43.067
HE'S FLATLINE.
NO, NO, NO,
HE'S NOT FLATLINE.

14:43.067 --> 14:44.333
THERE'S MOVEMENT
IN HIS HEART.

14:44.367 --> 14:46.133
OKAY, UM, UH, LET'S--
LET'S SHOCK HIM.

14:46.167 --> 14:47.500
UH, CHARGE THE FIBRILLATOR.

14:47.533 --> 14:48.633
VENTILATE, GEORGE.

14:48.667 --> 14:51.100
I AM.
CHARGING TO 200.

14:51.133 --> 14:53.067
(Cristina) YOU GOT IT?
YEAH.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.367
CLEAR.

14:54.400 --> 14:56.233
(paddles buzz)

14:56.267 --> 14:58.200
IS DR. BURKE ALIVE?
YES.

14:58.233 --> 15:00.667
SHAME. HE'D HAVE PROBABLY
HAVE MADE A GOOD DONOR.

15:00.700 --> 15:03.233
OKAY, PEOPLE,
LET'S GET OUR ORGANS

15:03.267 --> 15:05.267
AND GET OUTTA HERE.

15:05.300 --> 15:07.200
HEY, THAT HEART
IS NOT YOURS YET.

15:07.233 --> 15:09.133
SEATTLE GRACE IS STILL
WAITING FOR TEST RESULTS.

15:09.167 --> 15:11.667
WELL, I'M NOT. TEN BLADE.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

15:13.067 --> 15:14.600
I JUST DID.

15:17.133 --> 15:18.633
GIRLS.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.367
UM, I CALLED JILLIAN.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.433
AND I CALLED TESSA.

15:22.467 --> 15:24.400
AND THEN THEY CALLED
SIMON AND BIANCA AND DEBORAH.

15:24.433 --> 15:25.367
GIRLS--

15:25.400 --> 15:27.067
IT'S HER PROM, DR. WEBBER.

15:27.100 --> 15:28.467
SHE CAN'T MISS HER WHOLE PROM.

15:28.500 --> 15:31.300
SO... WE, LIKE,
BROUGHT IT TO HER.

15:31.333 --> 15:34.167
(teenagers speaking
indistinctly)

15:34.200 --> 15:35.733
KIDS...

15:35.767 --> 15:37.067
KIDS...

15:37.100 --> 15:38.800
LISTEN UP.

15:38.833 --> 15:40.733
LOOK, I KNOW YOU WANTED
TO SEE CAMILLE.

15:40.767 --> 15:42.600
WHY DON'T YOU
COME BACK TOMORROW,

15:42.633 --> 15:45.300
DURING THE DAY,
IN SMALLER GROUPS?

15:47.133 --> 15:48.467
LOOK, I'M SORRY, GIRLS.

15:48.500 --> 15:50.800
I CAN'T HAVE
A BUNCH OF TEENAGERS

15:50.833 --> 15:52.300
RUNNING IN THE HALLWAYS.

15:52.333 --> 15:53.800
PEOPLE ARE SICK.

15:53.833 --> 15:55.200
PEOPLE ARE DY--

15:55.233 --> 15:56.600
DYING?

15:56.633 --> 15:58.733
YEAH, WE KNOW.

16:10.167 --> 16:12.667
HOW YOU DOIN'?

16:12.700 --> 16:15.767
I'M DEVELOPING NUMBNESS
IN MY...

16:15.800 --> 16:17.700
FOURTH AND FIFTH FINGERS.

16:17.733 --> 16:22.667
AND THERE'S A PSEUDOANEURYSM
IN THE SUBCLAVIAN ARTERY.

16:22.700 --> 16:25.433
YOU KNOW THE DRILL.

16:25.467 --> 16:26.667
WE'LL WAIT A FEW DAYS,

16:26.700 --> 16:29.300
MAYBE THE ANEURYSM
WON'T GROW.

16:29.333 --> 16:31.800
EVEN IF IT STAYS THIS SIZE,
THERE'S TOO MUCH DAMAGE.

16:31.833 --> 16:34.300
WE'LL JUST GO IN THERE
AND WE'LL FIX IT,

16:34.333 --> 16:37.233
RELIEVE THE COMPRESSION
ON THE NERVES.

16:37.267 --> 16:41.800
BUT THE OPERATION COULD CAUSE
DAMAGE TO THE NERVES.

16:41.833 --> 16:43.133
YES.

16:43.167 --> 16:45.167
AND I COULD...

16:45.200 --> 16:47.267
LOSE FUNCTION
OF THE ENTIRE ARM.

16:47.300 --> 16:48.667
(inhales sharply)

16:48.700 --> 16:50.800
Y-YES. (clears throat)

16:50.833 --> 16:53.500
YOU CAN DO THIS?

16:53.533 --> 16:56.767
ARE YOU GOOD ENOUGH
TO DO THIS?

17:00.133 --> 17:02.500
I THINK SO.

17:04.433 --> 17:05.767
BUT YOU'RE NOT SURE.

17:05.800 --> 17:08.100
BUT I'M NOT SURE.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.200
SO...

17:14.233 --> 17:16.600
WHAT DO I DO?

17:16.633 --> 17:20.233
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU TO ASK
THOSE KIND OF QUESTIONS.

17:20.267 --> 17:23.267
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU
NOT TO HAVE THE ANSWERS.

17:29.100 --> 17:31.067
HOW DARE YOU SEND
THOSE KIDS AWAY?

17:31.067 --> 17:32.367
ADELE, PLEASE...

17:32.400 --> 17:35.067
YOU'RE EMOTIONAL, OKAY?

17:35.100 --> 17:38.400
I JUST TOLD MY SISTER
HER BABY'S CANCER IS BACK.

17:38.433 --> 17:41.300
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT
I'M EMOTIONAL.

17:41.333 --> 17:44.200
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BEND
YOUR PRECIOUS RULES

17:44.233 --> 17:45.567
FOR CAMILLE, FINE.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.500
DON'T DO IT FOR HER.
DO IT FOR ME.

17:47.533 --> 17:49.833
DO IT FOR YOUR WIFE
WHO NEVER ASKS YOU FOR ANYTHING,

17:49.867 --> 17:51.767
WHO SAYS NOTHING
ABOUT YOUR LONG HOURS,

17:51.800 --> 17:53.300
WHO LOOKS THE OTHER WAY

17:53.333 --> 17:55.267
WHILE YOU HAVE AN AFFAIR
WITH ANOTHER WOMAN,

17:55.300 --> 17:57.200
WHO SOBERED YOU UP
WHEN THAT WOMAN LEFT YOU,

17:57.233 --> 17:59.567
WHO STAYED WITH YOU
WHEN EVERYONE--

17:59.600 --> 18:01.500
EVERYONE SAID I WOULD BE
BETTER OFF ALONE.

18:01.533 --> 18:03.667
I'M NOT ASKING YOU,
I'M TELLING YOU.

18:03.700 --> 18:05.700
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE THIS UP
TO CAMILLE.

18:05.733 --> 18:08.267
YOU'RE GONNA PRIORITIZE
THE NEEDS OF YOUR FAMILY

18:08.300 --> 18:10.433
ABOVE THOSE
OF YOUR OTHER PATIENTS.

18:10.467 --> 18:13.133
OR...

18:13.167 --> 18:16.633
YOU'RE GONNA FIND
A NEW PLACE TO SLEEP.

18:21.633 --> 18:23.633
(Addison) DEREK.

18:23.667 --> 18:25.167
NOT NOW, ADDISON.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.133
DEREK.

18:26.167 --> 18:27.500
NOT NOW.

18:27.533 --> 18:30.733
***

18:30.767 --> 18:33.333
(sighs)

18:33.367 --> 18:37.433
THERE'S NEVER A GOOD PLACE
TO HIDE IN THIS HOSPITAL.

18:37.467 --> 18:39.833
(sighs)

18:39.867 --> 18:42.733
***

18:42.767 --> 18:44.267
(sighs)

18:44.300 --> 18:46.200
I'M TRYING TO GET PERSPECTIVE.

18:46.233 --> 18:47.767
EVERYTHING FEELS ENORMOUS,
LIKE IT'S ALL...

18:47.800 --> 18:51.600
JUST--
I-I CAN'T GET PERSPECTIVE.

18:51.633 --> 18:54.267
***

18:54.300 --> 18:56.600
MY NIECE'S CANCER
HAS COME BACK.

18:56.633 --> 19:00.667
SHE'S 17 YEARS OLD,
AND SHE'S GONNA DIE.

19:05.500 --> 19:08.267
PLUS...

19:08.300 --> 19:12.267
25 YEARS AGO, I HAD
A SECRET AFFAIR WITH...

19:12.300 --> 19:14.800
ELLIS GREY.

19:14.833 --> 19:16.733
AND TODAY I FIND OUT

19:16.767 --> 19:20.467
THAT MY WIFE KNEW
THE ENTIRE TIME.

19:20.500 --> 19:25.433
THERE WAS NO... SECRET.

19:25.467 --> 19:28.800
AND SHE STAYED WITH ME.

19:28.833 --> 19:30.733
HMM.

19:30.767 --> 19:33.767
***

19:35.600 --> 19:37.233
I RESPECT HIM, YOU KNOW?

19:37.267 --> 19:40.733
DR. BURKE--I...

19:40.767 --> 19:42.067
I RESPECT HIM.

19:42.100 --> 19:44.700
HE'S DECENT. HE'S HONORABLE.

19:44.733 --> 19:46.633
HE'S AN ARROGANT ASS
WHO JUST HOGS THE O.R.

19:46.667 --> 19:49.100
AND HE THINKS HE'S GOD, BUT...

19:49.133 --> 19:53.800
HE'S DECENT
AND HE'S HONORABLE.

19:53.833 --> 19:55.733
I RESPECT HIM.

19:55.767 --> 19:57.600
***

19:57.633 --> 19:59.533
HE'S ONE OF THE FOREMOST
CARDIOTHORACIC SURGEONS

19:59.567 --> 20:01.033
IN THE COUNTRY,

20:01.067 --> 20:02.733
AND I'VE GOTTA JUST...

20:06.100 --> 20:08.500
IT'S HIS HAND.

20:10.633 --> 20:14.400
I CANNOT GET PERSPECTIVE.

20:14.433 --> 20:15.800
I CAN'T DO THIS.

20:15.833 --> 20:17.733
I CAN'T BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR HIM.

20:17.767 --> 20:20.367
PRESTON'S AN HONORABLE
AND DECENT MAN,

20:20.400 --> 20:22.300
BUT, DEREK, SO ARE YOU.

20:22.333 --> 20:23.700
I DON'T KNOW.

20:23.733 --> 20:26.067
YOU ARE HONORABLE
AND DECENT.

20:26.100 --> 20:29.100
AND YOU'RE TOO HONORABLE
AND DECENT TO RUN.

20:29.133 --> 20:32.367
***

20:33.500 --> 20:37.133
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
I WISH THIS WAS BOURBON.

20:37.167 --> 20:40.467
***

20:49.067 --> 20:51.600
ANYTHING I CAN GET FOR YOU,
DR. BURKE?

20:51.633 --> 20:53.700
NO. I'M FINE.

20:53.733 --> 20:57.333
NO, THERE--
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING.

20:58.367 --> 21:02.433
OH, IT WOULD BE NICE TO...
HAVE SOME ICE CHIPS

21:02.467 --> 21:07.067
AND, UH, A TOUCH OF MORPHINE
IF I'M ALLOWED...

21:10.067 --> 21:12.767
AND, UH...

21:12.800 --> 21:15.667
CRISTINA.

21:17.133 --> 21:20.400
COMIN' RIGHT UP.

21:23.500 --> 21:25.167
WHERE IS CRISTINA?

21:25.200 --> 21:26.533
WHERE ARE--

21:26.567 --> 21:29.300
WHERE ARE
ALL OF THE SUCK UPS?

21:29.333 --> 21:31.400
EXCUSE ME?

21:31.433 --> 21:32.800
MY INTERNS--

21:32.833 --> 21:36.267
MY ASS-KISSIN', SURGERY HUNGRY,
COMPETITIVE SUCK UPS,

21:36.300 --> 21:38.633
WHERE ARE THEY?

21:38.667 --> 21:40.133
WHY AREN'T THEY HERE

21:40.167 --> 21:42.067
FETCHING YOU ICE CHIPS
AND MORPHINE?

21:42.100 --> 21:44.533
WHY AREN'T THEY HERE
SUCKING UP?

21:47.233 --> 21:48.600
YOU KNOW SOMETHING.

21:48.633 --> 21:51.200
I'M A PATIENT.

21:51.233 --> 21:54.200
PRESTON XAVIER BURKE...

21:54.233 --> 21:56.700
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE
WITH MY SUCK UPS?

21:56.733 --> 21:58.633
(monitor beeping erratically)
WHAT DO WE DO?
WHAT DO WE DO?

21:58.667 --> 22:00.133
I'M STARTING DOPAMINE
AND DOBUTAMINE DRIPS.

22:00.167 --> 22:02.467
(Meredith) WE CAN USE
THOSE TOGETHER, RIGHT?

22:02.500 --> 22:03.667
WHAT ABOUT MILRINONE?
I DON'T KNOW.

22:03.700 --> 22:05.733
YOU KNOW, NONE OF US KNOW.
JUST START THE DOBUTAMINE AND--

22:05.767 --> 22:08.633
WHAT ABOUT NESERITIDE?
THAT MIGHT HELP.
I FEEL LIKE MY CHEST
IS RUNNING AWAY.

22:08.667 --> 22:11.167
(Meredith) HEART RATE 217.
HE'S IN S.V.T.

22:11.200 --> 22:13.133
NO, NO, IZZIE, STOP PUMPING.
STOP.

22:13.167 --> 22:14.800
NO, THERE'S NO CHANGE.
WE NEED THAT MEDICINE.

22:14.833 --> 22:16.133
WHAT MEDICINE?
I'LL KNOW IT WHEN I SEE IT.

22:16.167 --> 22:17.700
I-I THINK--THE ONE
THAT STOPS THE HEART.

22:17.733 --> 22:20.100
HERE, HOLD THE MASK.
NO, THE WHOLE POINT IS
TO KEEP MY HEART BEATING.

22:20.133 --> 22:22.667
NO, NO, NO, IT ONLY STOPS
YOUR HEART FOR SIX SECONDS--
MEREDITH, IT'S ADENOSINE.

22:22.700 --> 22:24.200
UH, HIS HEART
IS SPEEDING UP, GUYS.

22:24.233 --> 22:25.833
YOU GUYS,
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING!

22:25.867 --> 22:27.500
HE CANNOT TAKE THIS
FOR MUCH LONGER.

22:27.533 --> 22:29.633
WHAT ABOUT SHOCKING HIM?
I DON'T--
FOUND IT.

22:29.667 --> 22:31.300
CRISTINA, COME OVER HERE.
OKAY.

22:31.333 --> 22:33.500
LIFT UP HIS ARM.
THE NURSES ALWAYS LIFT THE ARM

22:33.533 --> 22:36.367
WHEN THEY PUSH ADENOSINE.
IT GETS TO THE HEART FASTER.

22:36.400 --> 22:38.300
OKAY, DENNY,
YOU'RE GONNA FEEL, UM--
IZZIE!

22:38.333 --> 22:40.067
NO, IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.
IT JUST FEELS LIKE--
I'M GONNA DIE.

22:40.100 --> 22:42.733
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DIE.
I PROMISE. IT'S JUST THE MEDS.
WE'RE HEADING BACK
TO FLATLINE.

22:42.767 --> 22:45.267
ARE YOU SURE
WE USED THE RIGHT DRUG?
(George) THE BOOK SAID
IT WAS THE RIGHT ONE.

22:45.300 --> 22:47.133
I USED THE ONE I KNOW.
HE'S NOT GONNA DIE,
RIGHT?

22:47.167 --> 22:49.833
RIGHT? RIGHT?

22:49.867 --> 22:54.133
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

22:57.767 --> 22:59.500
(monitor beeping steadily)

22:59.533 --> 23:02.400
(Denny breathing raspily)

23:02.433 --> 23:04.367
(George) ALL RIGHT.

23:04.400 --> 23:06.267
YOU FOOLS

23:06.300 --> 23:09.700
BETTER HAVE A GOOD EXPLANATION
FOR THIS.

23:14.267 --> 23:16.533
STEP AWAY FROM THE PATIENT.

23:18.133 --> 23:21.100
STEP AWAY FROM THE PATIENT.

23:21.133 --> 23:23.067
I CAN'T.

23:23.067 --> 23:25.467
I HAVE TO PUMP HIS HEART.

23:27.667 --> 23:29.533
OLIVIA...

23:29.567 --> 23:31.167
TAKE OVER FOR DR. STEVENS.

23:31.200 --> 23:33.100
IZZIE, YOU'RE DONE HERE.

23:33.133 --> 23:35.567
I NEED YOU TO LEAVE THE ROOM.

23:45.133 --> 23:45.800
IZZIE--

23:45.833 --> 23:47.400
NO, DO NOT TOUCH ME!

23:52.133 --> 23:55.467
OLIVIA, STAY...

23:55.500 --> 23:56.800
WITH DR. STEVENS.

23:56.833 --> 23:59.600
HELP HER IF SHE'LL LET YOU.

23:59.633 --> 24:02.333
YOU THREE, OUTSIDE.

24:02.367 --> 24:05.200
NOW!

24:08.267 --> 24:09.733
(whispers)
WHERE WAS RATIONAL THOUGHT?

24:09.767 --> 24:11.767
WHERE WAS COGNITIVE THINKING?

24:11.800 --> 24:13.800
WHERE WAS FIRST DO NO HARM?

24:13.833 --> 24:16.267
THE MORALS, THE ETHICS--
WHERE WAS SANITY

24:16.300 --> 24:18.567
WHEN YOU THREE DECIDED
TO HELP THAT GIRL?

24:18.600 --> 24:20.467
WE DIDN'T--
NO, NO. NO SPEAKING.
NOBODY SPEAKS.

24:20.500 --> 24:22.400
I DO NOT WANT TO HAVE TO
TESTIFY AGAINST ANY OF YOU

24:22.433 --> 24:23.533
IN A COURT OF LAW.

24:23.567 --> 24:26.067
NOT ONE WORD.

24:27.733 --> 24:31.333
SHE CUT HIS LVAD WIRE.

24:31.367 --> 24:33.233
(normal voice) LOOK,
I SAID NO SPEAKING.
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING!

24:33.267 --> 24:35.767
I SAID NO MOVING.

24:35.800 --> 24:38.133
CRISTINA,
BURKE IS ASKING FOR YOU.

24:38.167 --> 24:39.733
GO.

24:39.767 --> 24:42.133
I'M ASSUMING YOU RAN LABS?

24:43.533 --> 24:46.300
I'M ASKING A QUESTION.

24:46.333 --> 24:47.533
ANSWER ME!

24:47.567 --> 24:50.300
YOU SAID NO SPEAK--
I KNOW WHAT I SAID.

24:50.333 --> 24:51.267
YES.

24:51.300 --> 24:53.300
O'MALLEY,
GET ME THE LAB RESULTS.

24:53.333 --> 24:54.633
DO NOT PASS GO,

24:54.667 --> 24:56.567
DO NOT TALK
TO ANOTHER LIVING SOUL.

24:56.600 --> 24:59.367
GET THE LABS, GET BACK HERE.

24:59.400 --> 25:00.667
GREY...

25:00.700 --> 25:02.667
(sighs)

25:02.700 --> 25:04.200
COME WITH ME.

25:04.233 --> 25:07.600
(thunder rumbles)

25:17.167 --> 25:19.500
HOW ARE YOU?

25:19.533 --> 25:22.067
YOU LOOK GOOD.

25:22.067 --> 25:25.167
ARE THOSE YOUR FILMS?

25:34.333 --> 25:37.800
OH... BURKE.

25:39.233 --> 25:43.167
SHEPHERD, UH, DOESN'T KNOW
IF HE CAN FIX MY HAND.

25:43.200 --> 25:45.100
BUT MAYBE I'LL WAIT IT OUT,

25:45.133 --> 25:47.767
SEE IF THIS NUMBNESS SUBSIDES.

25:47.800 --> 25:50.633
YEAH.

25:50.667 --> 25:53.567
OR I COULD
LET SHEPHERD OPERATE.

25:53.600 --> 25:56.800
YEAH. YEAH.

25:58.500 --> 26:01.267
I COULD LOSE
ALL HAND FUNCTION.

26:01.300 --> 26:03.533
WHAT IF I COULD NEVER
OPERATE AGAIN?

26:03.567 --> 26:05.433
YEAH.

26:05.467 --> 26:06.400
CRISTINA.

26:06.433 --> 26:07.367
YEAH?

26:07.400 --> 26:08.833
STOP SAYING "YEAH."

26:08.867 --> 26:11.067
OKAY.

26:12.867 --> 26:15.300
I NEED...

26:17.133 --> 26:19.733
I NEED...

26:19.767 --> 26:23.067
YOU SAID YOU WERE HERE...

26:23.067 --> 26:24.500
FOR ME.

26:24.533 --> 26:25.467
YEAH.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.200
OH, SORRY.

26:27.233 --> 26:28.167
CRISTINA.

26:28.200 --> 26:29.267
HMM?

26:29.300 --> 26:33.200
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME...

26:33.233 --> 26:37.067
WHAT YOU THINK I SHOULD DO.

26:42.100 --> 26:44.100
I...

26:49.667 --> 26:54.267
I-I TOLD DR. BAILEY
THAT I WOULD BE BACK, OKAY?

26:54.300 --> 26:58.133
I-I TOLD HER THAT I--
I WOULDN'T BE LONG, OKAY?

26:58.167 --> 26:58.933
CRISTINA.

26:58.967 --> 27:02.067
I'M--I'M--
I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT IT.

27:02.067 --> 27:03.800
I...

27:03.833 --> 27:07.367
I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT IT,
OKAY?

27:12.333 --> 27:15.067
(thunder rumbles)

27:21.867 --> 27:25.067
(breathing heavily)

27:37.333 --> 27:39.433
HOW YOU FEELIN', DENNY?

27:39.467 --> 27:40.600
REALLY, REALLY GOOD,

27:40.633 --> 27:42.700
LIKE AN ATHLETE
OR A SUPERHERO

27:42.733 --> 27:45.433
OR SOME OTHER KIND OF
REALLY HEALTHY PERSON.

27:45.467 --> 27:48.267
YOU'RE FUNNY.
YOU'RE A FUNNY GUY.

27:48.300 --> 27:51.133
(whispers)
IZZIE, NO SPEAKING.

27:51.167 --> 27:54.133
I CUT MY OWN LVAD WIRES,
YOU KNOW?

27:54.167 --> 27:56.067
I WENT ROGUE,

27:56.067 --> 27:58.400
ALL MY MYSELF.

27:58.433 --> 28:00.333
SHUSH. YOU'RE WEAK ENOUGH
AS IT IS.

28:00.367 --> 28:02.567
PLEASE DON'T WASTE ENERGY
ON LYING.

28:04.367 --> 28:05.700
DR. BAILEY.

28:05.733 --> 28:08.333
I DID INDEED SAY
NO SPEAKING.

28:08.367 --> 28:10.533
I DON'T CARE.

28:10.567 --> 28:13.300
HE'S GONNA GET THE HEART,
RIGHT?

28:13.333 --> 28:15.233
YOU'RE GONNA SIGN THE CHARTS

28:15.267 --> 28:17.133
AND TALK TO
THE TRANSPLANT COORDINATOR?

28:17.167 --> 28:19.400
HERE ARE THE LABS.

28:20.867 --> 28:22.800
SEE? SEE, HIS B.U.N.

28:22.833 --> 28:24.433
AND CREATININE ARE INCREASING.

28:24.467 --> 28:25.600
HE CLEARLY HAS
PULMONARY EDEMA.

28:25.633 --> 28:28.333
HE DESERVES TO MOVE UP TO 1A
STATUS ON THE TRANSPLANT LIST.

28:28.367 --> 28:30.133
U.N.O.S. WILL GIVE HIM
THE HEART.

28:30.167 --> 28:31.467
YOU JUST NEED TO CALL.
ISOBEL STEVENS,

28:31.500 --> 28:33.400
I TAKE MY MEDICAL ADVICE
FROM DOCTORS.

28:33.433 --> 28:35.367
YOU ARE A VISITOR.

28:35.400 --> 28:38.800
WHAT?
AS OF NOW, YOU ARE A VISITOR
IN THIS HOSPITAL.

28:38.833 --> 28:40.833
YOU WILL NOT BE A DOCTOR
IN THIS HOSPITAL AGAIN

28:40.867 --> 28:42.700
UNTIL I DECIDE YOU ARE.

28:42.733 --> 28:46.067
OLIVIA,
TAKE OVER THE HEART PUMP.

29:03.800 --> 29:06.100
HE GETS THE HEART, THOUGH,
RIGHT?

29:06.133 --> 29:09.600
SIR, UH, I NEED TO ASK YOU
A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION.

29:09.633 --> 29:11.733
CAN'T WE DO THIS
ANOTHER TIME?

29:11.767 --> 29:14.400
UH, IF SOMEONE ON THE STAFF

29:14.433 --> 29:16.767
DELIBERATELY UNHOOKED
A TRANSPLANT CANDIDATE

29:16.800 --> 29:19.667
FROM HIS LVAD IN AN ATTEMPT
TO WORSEN HIS CONDITION

29:19.700 --> 29:22.200
AND GET HIM MOVED UP
THE DONOR LIST,

29:22.233 --> 29:25.367
HYPOTHETICALLY, SIR...

29:25.400 --> 29:27.300
I THINK
YOU NEED TO TELL ME

29:27.333 --> 29:29.167
EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON
HERE, DOCTOR.

29:29.200 --> 29:32.200
BELIEVE ME, SIR, YOU WANT THIS
TO STAY A HYPOTHETICAL,

29:32.233 --> 29:34.667
BECAUSE I'M THINKING IF
SOMETHING LIKE THAT DID HAPPEN,

29:34.700 --> 29:36.133
YOU'D BE
DUTY-BOUND TO REPORT IT,

29:36.167 --> 29:38.067
AND THE HOSPITAL WOULD BE
IN DANGER OF LOSING

29:38.100 --> 29:39.633
ITS ACCREDITATION
AS A TRANSPLANT SITE.

29:39.667 --> 29:41.700
SO HYPOTHETICALLY...

29:41.733 --> 29:44.500
HYPOTHETICALLY,
IF THE PATIENT GOT WORSE,

29:44.533 --> 29:48.100
WOULD IT BE UNETHICAL
FOR HIM TO RECEIVE THE HEART,

29:48.133 --> 29:50.067
EVEN THOUGH, MEDICALLY,
HIS WORSENED CONDITION

29:50.067 --> 29:52.700
NOW PUTS HIM AT THE TOP
OF THE DONOR LIST...

29:52.733 --> 29:54.767
HYPOTHETICALLY?

29:54.800 --> 29:57.167
HOW BAD IS HE?

29:57.200 --> 30:00.067
IN THE FEW HOURS IT WOULD TAKE
A NEW LVAD TO BE DELIVERED,

30:00.100 --> 30:01.600
HE'LL BE DEAD.

30:01.633 --> 30:05.200
OUR RESPONSIBILITY
IS TO THE PATIENT.

30:05.233 --> 30:09.067
IF, MEDICALLY,
HE'S AT THE TOP OF THE LIST,

30:09.100 --> 30:12.333
THEN HE SHOULD GET THE HEART.

30:12.367 --> 30:14.833
HYPOTHETICALLY.
THANK YOU, SIR.

30:14.867 --> 30:16.233
BUT PRACTICALLY,

30:16.267 --> 30:18.167
WHOEVER REMOVED THE PATIENT
FROM THE LVAD,

30:18.200 --> 30:20.633
I EXPECT TO BE GIVEN NAMES,

30:20.667 --> 30:26.533
AND THERE WILL BE SEVERE,
SEVERE CONSEQUENCES.

30:26.567 --> 30:29.333
YES, SIR.

30:29.367 --> 30:30.533
(Alex speaking indistinctly)

30:30.567 --> 30:32.233
WAIT. HOLD ON.

30:32.267 --> 30:33.433
DR. HAHN.

30:33.467 --> 30:35.167
DR. HAHN.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.300
CAN'T STOP NOW, KAREV.

30:36.333 --> 30:39.233
I ONLY HAVE A FEW HOURS
TO GET THIS HEART INTO MY GUY.

30:39.267 --> 30:41.033
DR. HAHN.

30:45.800 --> 30:47.700
U.N.O.S. GAVE THE HEART
TO SEATTLE GRACE.

30:47.733 --> 30:49.633
THE TRANSPLANT COORDINATOR
ALREADY CALLED

30:49.667 --> 30:51.567
AND STOPPED YOUR GUY
FROM BEING PREPPED.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.433
OH, COME ON.

30:53.467 --> 30:55.500
HE HAS KIDS.

30:55.533 --> 30:57.167
THEY'RE 4 AND 5.

30:57.200 --> 31:01.267
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG
HE'S BEEN WAITING FOR THIS?

31:01.300 --> 31:03.233
HE'S A GOOD PERSON.

31:03.267 --> 31:06.133
HE DESERVES A HEART.

31:06.167 --> 31:07.667
I'M SORRY.

31:07.700 --> 31:09.067
(scoffs) I'LL BET YOU ARE.

31:09.067 --> 31:11.667
NO, I AM. BELIEVE ME.

31:18.567 --> 31:21.300
LISTEN...

31:21.333 --> 31:23.233
WE HAVE A CHOPPER
WAITING ON THE ROOF.

31:23.267 --> 31:25.200
AND?

31:25.233 --> 31:28.233
***

31:31.700 --> 31:33.667
YOU COULD TAKE UP FISHING.

31:33.700 --> 31:35.567
I DON'T FISH.

31:35.600 --> 31:38.400
FISHING'S A LOT MORE FUN
THAN SURGERY.

31:38.433 --> 31:41.433
I HAVE 80% HAND FUNCTION NOW.

31:41.467 --> 31:45.067
MM-HMM. 80% IS NOT ENOUGH.

31:45.100 --> 31:47.267
NOT FOR YOU.

31:47.300 --> 31:50.300
***

31:52.800 --> 31:55.100
FISHING, HUH?

31:55.133 --> 31:56.567
YOU DON'T FISH.

31:56.600 --> 31:59.600

32:05.500 --> 32:09.600

32:56.300 --> 33:00.233

33:02.633 --> 33:04.067
SHEPHERD.

33:04.067 --> 33:05.800
YOU DON'T HAVE TO THANK ME.

33:05.833 --> 33:07.733
I'M SURE YOU'LL RETURN
THE FAVOR ONE DAY.

33:07.767 --> 33:11.300
I WAS GOING TO SAY
PLEASE TRY NOT TO KILL ME.

33:11.333 --> 33:12.467
(laughs)

33:12.500 --> 33:14.833
(laughs) I'LL DO MY BEST.

33:14.867 --> 33:18.067
OKAY.

33:18.100 --> 33:21.167
***

33:32.567 --> 33:35.633

33:37.500 --> 33:39.700
(Miranda) MM.

33:39.733 --> 33:41.233
LOOK AT THAT THING.

33:41.267 --> 33:44.133
THE LEFT VENTRICLE'S
EXCESSIVELY DILATED.

33:44.167 --> 33:47.333
HE WOULDN'T HAVE LASTED
ANOTHER HOUR WITH THIS HEART.

33:47.367 --> 33:48.800
NO, HE WOULDN'T HAVE.

33:48.833 --> 33:50.600
***

33:50.633 --> 33:52.367
(Derek) OKAY, RETRACT THAT
A LITTLE BIT RIGHT HERE.

33:52.400 --> 33:54.200
OKAY, I AM NOW REMOVING
THE ANEURYSM

33:54.233 --> 33:56.400
FROM THE NERVE CLUSTER.

33:58.133 --> 34:00.733
(monitor beeps)
(woman)
N.A.P.s ARE DROPPING.

34:00.767 --> 34:03.100
ARTERIAL PRESSURE'S DOWN 50%.

34:03.133 --> 34:05.200
(Richard)
DID YOU CUT THE NERVE ROOT?

34:05.233 --> 34:07.133
I DON'T SEE ANY DISCONTINUITY
OF THE NERVES.

34:07.167 --> 34:09.733
ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO A, UH,
REFLEX TEST ON HIS HAND.

34:09.767 --> 34:11.367
CHIEF.

34:11.400 --> 34:12.400
OKAY.

34:12.433 --> 34:13.467
NOTHING.

34:13.500 --> 34:15.533
OKAY. TRY IT AGAIN.

34:15.567 --> 34:18.133
MNH-MNH.

34:18.167 --> 34:19.600
THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

34:19.633 --> 34:21.433
I WOULD KNOW
IF I SEVERED A NERVE.

34:21.467 --> 34:25.300
DEREK, IS THE ARM PARALYZED?

34:25.333 --> 34:27.333
OKAY...

34:27.367 --> 34:29.267
I'M GONNA HAVE TO DO
A WAKE-UP TEST.

34:29.300 --> 34:32.633
DEREK--
THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON
WHO CAN HELP ME FIGURE OUT

34:32.667 --> 34:34.567
WHETHER OR NOT I'VE DAMAGED
THE RELAY OR NOT,

34:34.600 --> 34:37.433
AND THAT'S BURKE.
HE'S BEEN THROUGH A LOT
OF TRAUMA TODAY.

34:37.467 --> 34:39.567
I'M TRYING TO PREVENT
THE TRAUMA HE'S GONNA FEEL

34:39.600 --> 34:42.467
IF I HAVE TO TELL HIM
HE'S PARALYZED.

34:42.500 --> 34:45.100
***

34:45.133 --> 34:47.067
BAILEY'S TREATING US
LIKE WE'RE CHILDREN.

34:47.067 --> 34:48.233
WE'RE NOT CHILDREN.

34:48.267 --> 34:50.167
WE SHOULDN'T
HAVE TO SIT OUT HERE

34:50.200 --> 34:52.100
LIKE WE'RE ON A TIME-OUT
OR SOMETHING.

34:52.133 --> 34:53.633
IT IS A TIME-OUT.

34:53.667 --> 34:56.533
WHAT WE DID IS WAY IN NEED
OF A TIME-OUT.

34:56.567 --> 34:59.433
YOU REALIZE WE COULD GET KICKED
OUT OF THE PROGRAM FOR THIS?

34:59.467 --> 35:00.700
NOT "WE."

35:00.733 --> 35:03.300
I DID THIS.

35:03.333 --> 35:05.333
I DID THIS.

35:07.200 --> 35:10.367
AND YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.
MAYBE I SHOULD RUN.

35:10.400 --> 35:13.067
BUT I'D RATHER BE RUNNING
TOWARDS SOMEBODY

35:13.100 --> 35:15.067
THAN RUNNING AWAY.

35:15.067 --> 35:17.633
(Richard) YANG,
SHEP'S ASKING FOR YOU.

35:17.667 --> 35:18.833
UH, FOR BURKE'S SURGERY?

35:18.867 --> 35:20.400
YES. HURRY UP.

35:20.433 --> 35:21.600
UH...

35:21.633 --> 35:23.800
I-I CAN'T.
I'M... I'M IN A TIME-OUT.

35:23.833 --> 35:26.267
TIME-OUT'S OVER,
RIGHT NOW.

35:26.300 --> 35:28.367
YES, SIR.
YANG, WE NEED YOU.

35:31.233 --> 35:34.167
HE SAID, "MARRY ME," RIGHT?
HE DID?

35:34.200 --> 35:36.100
THAT REALLY HAPPENED?

35:36.133 --> 35:37.300
IT REALLY HAPPENED.

35:37.333 --> 35:39.800
IT REALLY DID.

35:42.867 --> 35:45.733
SCREW THIS.
I'M CHECKING ON DENNY.

35:52.367 --> 35:55.200
(Derek)
OKAY. HOW ARE WE DOING?

35:55.233 --> 35:57.100
HE'S JUST AT THE EDGE
OF CONSCIOUSNESS.

35:57.133 --> 36:00.100
VERY LIGHT.
HE SHOULD BE UP SOON.

36:00.133 --> 36:02.067
OKAY.

36:02.067 --> 36:03.167
YANG, YOU'RE UP.

36:03.200 --> 36:04.833
OH. WHAT? SORRY.

36:04.867 --> 36:06.767
WHAT DO YOU NEED ME TO DO?

36:06.800 --> 36:08.700
WHEN HE COMES TO,
HE'S GONNA BE DISORIENTED,

36:08.733 --> 36:10.667
AND HE'S PROBABLY GONNA FIGHT
THE INTUBATION.

36:10.700 --> 36:12.767
WE CAN'T NUMB THE ARM BECAUSE WE
NEED HIM TO MOVE HIS FINGERS,

36:12.800 --> 36:15.367
SO HE'S GONNA BE IN
A LOT OF PAIN.

36:15.400 --> 36:17.433
SO WE NEED YOU
TO KEEP HIM FOCUSED, OKAY?
OKAY. YEAH.

36:17.467 --> 36:19.367
OKAY, LET'S--
LET'S WAKE HIM UP.

36:19.400 --> 36:22.267
BURKE.

36:24.067 --> 36:28.200
THANK YOU FOR CALLING ME
ABOUT IZZIE.

36:29.600 --> 36:32.133
I-I DIDN'T DO YOU
ANY FAVORS.

36:33.833 --> 36:35.533
WELL, IT MEANT SOMETHING.

36:35.567 --> 36:37.567
THAT YOU CALLED
MEANT SOMETHING TO ME.

36:37.600 --> 36:40.200
IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

36:40.233 --> 36:42.333
RIGHT. OKAY. SORRY.

36:42.367 --> 36:44.333
STOP SAYING
THAT YOU'RE SORRY!

36:50.667 --> 36:53.267
YOU WANNA KNOW SOMETHING?

36:55.167 --> 36:57.167
I KNEW.

36:58.533 --> 37:02.433
I KNEW YOU DIDN'T FEEL
THAT WAY ABOUT ME...

37:02.467 --> 37:05.500
EVEN DURING...

37:05.533 --> 37:09.100
WHEN WE WERE IN BED,
I KNEW.

37:09.133 --> 37:11.067
I KNEW,
AND I STILL LET IT HAPPEN

37:11.067 --> 37:13.800
BECAUSE, UM...
