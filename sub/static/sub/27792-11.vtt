00:00.959 --> 00:02.871
<i>Previously on</i> The Magicians...

00:03.586 --> 00:06.079
<i>Everett's trying
to squeeze out hedges.</i>

00:06.173 --> 00:08.085
This is just
more of the same.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.924
We're here to study
with Mayakovsky.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.033
- We hear he's crazy.
- You heard wrong!

00:16.058 --> 00:17.390
<i>So wait.</i>

00:17.476 --> 00:19.934
So you turned Mayakovsky
into a bear?

00:20.020 --> 00:22.182
I can help.

00:22.272 --> 00:23.808
Just let me stay.

00:23.899 --> 00:27.267
You saved my life.
You can save my life 50 times.

00:27.361 --> 00:31.230
It's not gonna change
anything between us.

00:31.323 --> 00:33.235
Goodbye, Alice.

00:33.325 --> 00:36.534
The Poison Room. It's where we store books
too dangerous for the public.

00:36.620 --> 00:38.782
You must seek the Binder.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.329
<i>This was
in the Mirror World.</i>

00:40.415 --> 00:43.158
And I heard you were looking
for the Binder, so...

00:44.586 --> 00:45.622
Holy shit.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.374
Foremost saved them

00:47.464 --> 00:49.626
<i>with special weapons
that expel possession.</i>

00:49.716 --> 00:51.082
<i>They call them ice axes,</i>

00:51.176 --> 00:53.042
<i>and I'm assuming
that's poetic license.</i>

00:53.136 --> 00:55.173
<i>So we might have
a chance to save Eliot.</i>

00:56.640 --> 00:58.552
But Hot and Dumb
just wasn't getting it.

00:59.184 --> 01:01.426
And that's when I told
the Foreskin,

01:01.520 --> 01:03.603
"Welcome to the New
Desert Order.

01:03.689 --> 01:05.476
"It's gonna suck for you."

01:05.566 --> 01:07.502
Wow. You really went through
a lot to get those axes.

01:07.526 --> 01:09.768
Call them by their names.

01:10.195 --> 01:11.527
Sorrow,

01:12.030 --> 01:13.987
- and Sorrow.
- Nice.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.781
Where'd you get
the axes from?

01:16.994 --> 01:18.906
Fine. I'll tell it
one more time.

01:20.038 --> 01:22.433
So I'm all, "Welcome to the New Desert Order.

01:22.457 --> 01:24.574
"Gonna suck for you."

01:24.668 --> 01:25.829
What's gonna suck?

01:26.211 --> 01:28.453
Telling this story over again.

01:28.547 --> 01:30.413
And so I was like,

01:30.507 --> 01:33.591
"Welcome to the New Desert Order.
Gonna suck for you."

01:33.677 --> 01:36.511
- What did I miss?
- I'm getting a smoothie.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.179
You fuckers take this.

01:40.183 --> 01:42.412
You seriously...
You spent that much time in the desert,

01:42.436 --> 01:43.636
and this never
occurred to you?

01:43.854 --> 01:46.471
We're dealing
with god-level monsters.

01:46.565 --> 01:48.397
Who possess people.

01:48.650 --> 01:50.391
Those axes
pull the spirits out,

01:50.485 --> 01:52.147
and then
we bottle them up. Bam!

01:52.237 --> 01:53.478
FTW.

01:53.572 --> 01:56.064
All he's saying
is they're too powerful.

01:56.158 --> 01:58.275
I doubt your bottles
can hold that shit.

01:58.368 --> 02:01.202
Those monsters are coming for us.
Make it work.

02:01.705 --> 02:02.705
Okay, but how?

02:02.789 --> 02:05.497
We could cast an incorporate bond
on the bottles.

02:05.584 --> 02:06.791
Thank you.

02:06.877 --> 02:09.836
I don't know what that is,
but I hate you less now.

02:09.920 --> 02:12.334
It's a way to pin a being
or object in place.

02:12.424 --> 02:14.711
It's like a fourth-dimensional
paperweight.

02:14.801 --> 02:17.418
Mayakovsky was trapped
under one for years.

02:17.512 --> 02:20.129
We just need
to pin The Monster to your bottles

02:20.223 --> 02:21.423
long enough
to get rid of them.

02:22.184 --> 02:24.267
Great.
Let's do that shit, then.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.804
So who knows
how to cast an incorporate bond?

02:28.357 --> 02:31.100
I did cast an incorporate bond
on Mayakovsky,

02:31.193 --> 02:33.685
but I didn't
write the spell myself.

02:33.779 --> 02:35.145
So who wrote it?

02:35.238 --> 02:36.695
Mayakovsky did.

02:36.782 --> 02:39.115
He didn't know
I was going to use it on him.

02:39.201 --> 02:41.818
He was the only person
capable of writing a spell

02:41.912 --> 02:42.948
which he couldn't break.

02:43.038 --> 02:44.825
He knows more things
about incorporate bonds

02:44.915 --> 02:45.915
than anyone else does.

02:46.541 --> 02:50.205
You wanted a spell
to trap a god, yes?

02:50.295 --> 02:52.252
Well... He's the real expert.

02:53.298 --> 02:56.086
- But he's also a bear.
- Not exactly.

02:56.176 --> 03:01.672
You see, once magic came back,
he was able to become human. Again.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.007
Much to his wife's dismay.

03:04.935 --> 03:06.016
So where is he now?

03:06.103 --> 03:07.890
He went back
to Brakebills South?

03:07.979 --> 03:10.687
- I mean, why?
- Brakebills isn't using it.

03:10.774 --> 03:12.734
There's not enough magic
for the geese to make it.

03:13.485 --> 03:15.192
I found that out
the hard way.

03:15.278 --> 03:17.065
Rest in peace, first years.

03:17.155 --> 03:20.489
So, I guess we have to go down there
and talk to Mayakovsky?

03:20.575 --> 03:21.691
Sounds like a plan.

03:21.785 --> 03:24.072
You two have fun
talking to that old drunk.

03:24.996 --> 03:26.032
No.

03:27.207 --> 03:30.450
Wait. Margo, Margo, hey.
I just... I... There's, um...

03:30.544 --> 03:33.457
Things are still kinda weird
between me and Alice, and I just...

03:33.547 --> 03:36.192
Mmm-hmm, and I'm still rinsing
desert sand out of my twat, all right?

03:36.216 --> 03:37.707
I'm not going
to fucking Antarctica.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.627
Grow a pair of tits,
Coldwater.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.136
Jesus, it's cold.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.563
I forgot
my scarf, so...

03:52.649 --> 03:54.231
Good luck
with that.

04:01.366 --> 04:02.427
If it makes you
feel any better,

04:02.451 --> 04:04.864
I don't wanna be alone with you, either.
I never said that.

04:04.953 --> 04:07.286
Yes, you did.
I heard you say that to Margo.

04:07.497 --> 04:10.285
Let's just not start
by lying to each other.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.602
Okay. Look,
I don't want to be here,

04:11.626 --> 04:13.354
but we're here,
so let's just get it over with.

04:13.378 --> 04:14.619
Quentin.

04:16.464 --> 04:17.922
Shit.

04:20.010 --> 04:21.010
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

04:21.386 --> 04:22.968
Professor.

04:23.054 --> 04:24.670
Mayakovsky.

04:29.436 --> 04:30.597
Professor?

04:32.000 --> 04:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:48.914 --> 04:50.496
Mayakovsky did this
to himself.

04:50.582 --> 04:53.074
He designed a spell to swap
his present consciousness

04:53.168 --> 04:54.875
with one
from a different time.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.497
He called it
a timeshare spell.

04:57.923 --> 05:00.461
So that's
not our Mayakovsky?

05:00.550 --> 05:02.007
Not mentally, no.

05:02.093 --> 05:04.836
Based on these notes
and his current state,

05:04.930 --> 05:07.673
I think he's from the future,
where...

05:07.766 --> 05:10.179
Mayakovsky has dementia.

05:10.894 --> 05:13.932
- Great.
- Well, it was an accident.

05:14.022 --> 05:16.105
He inverted two of
the numbers in the spell.

05:16.191 --> 05:17.727
So, how do we undo it?

05:17.818 --> 05:19.229
He's the only one who can.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.339
I don't think
we can help him, Quentin.

05:21.363 --> 05:22.979
We may have hit a dead end.

05:24.115 --> 05:26.482
Unless I talk to him
in the past.

05:30.789 --> 05:33.953
You wanna steal Everett's book
from the Poison Room?

05:34.042 --> 05:36.455
It's the only way we can
get ahead of him, but...

05:37.504 --> 05:39.040
I need your help.

05:40.006 --> 05:43.670
Penny died 'cause of going
in there, so... No.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.839
I can get us
in and out unharmed,

05:45.929 --> 05:47.636
but protocol dictates

05:47.722 --> 05:50.055
Librarians enter
the Poison Room in pairs.

05:50.141 --> 05:51.677
For safety.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.009
Fogg can do it.

05:53.103 --> 05:55.345
Unfortunately,
I cannot leave Brakebills.

05:55.981 --> 05:58.849
The Library has been
up my ass.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.649
They're even threatening
to put monitors

06:00.735 --> 06:02.351
in all my classrooms.

06:02.445 --> 06:04.732
Henry has a point.
It would draw undue attention.

06:04.823 --> 06:07.065
Oh, to the fact
that he's a fucking coward?

06:07.158 --> 06:09.741
You don't get to be
a Magician my age, dear,

06:09.828 --> 06:13.447
without a very healthy sense
of self-preservation.

06:14.374 --> 06:15.706
Kady.

06:17.335 --> 06:18.496
Please.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.318
I mean, if this
is a real language,

06:24.342 --> 06:26.755
it is a dead one
that nobody's ever written about.

06:26.845 --> 06:28.211
Well, maybe
it's not a language.

06:28.305 --> 06:30.262
Maybe it's...

06:30.348 --> 06:33.011
Ow! Goddamn paper cut!

06:35.437 --> 06:37.895
Cocksucking book bit me.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.722
It did!

06:42.527 --> 06:45.645
Why is this book
suddenly blank?

06:45.739 --> 06:48.231
Hey, wait a minute.
Is that writing there?

06:48.992 --> 06:50.654
I can barely make it out.

06:51.036 --> 06:53.824
My God. I think it's written
in Margo's blood.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.621
It wants blood,
I got blood.

06:57.375 --> 06:58.707
BRB.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.959
- Is that...
- Yep.

07:05.050 --> 07:08.839
It's shark week.
You can thank my uterus later.

07:09.638 --> 07:10.754
This is in Latin.

07:10.847 --> 07:14.136
I can't cast.
Um, you better have a look at it.

07:14.225 --> 07:15.225
Oh...

07:16.061 --> 07:17.472
Oh, come on!

08:04.734 --> 08:06.942
And the Binder
stood before them,

08:07.028 --> 08:11.193
and as they stared,
eyes full of wonder,

08:11.282 --> 08:13.774
the Binder
thought to himself...

08:15.996 --> 08:17.578
"Took you long enough."

08:28.341 --> 08:30.674
- He's in there?
- Yes.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.822
And he's at an acquisitions meeting,
which should give us

08:32.846 --> 08:33.881
enough time to copy it.

08:33.972 --> 08:36.259
Okay, thanks.
Check back with me later.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.682
- Everett.
- Zelda.

08:39.309 --> 08:43.020
- How was the meeting?
- Detailed. I snuck out.

08:43.815 --> 08:45.181
What are you doing here?

08:45.650 --> 08:47.391
I was hoping we could talk.

08:48.153 --> 08:49.689
In your office, perhaps.

08:50.321 --> 08:51.482
Of course.

08:55.326 --> 08:57.784
The Binder knew Julia
had many questions.

08:57.871 --> 09:01.455
She'd been searching in vain
for how to reacquire her divinity.

09:02.834 --> 09:03.870
He knew the answer.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.121
Hey, what's with

09:05.211 --> 09:07.203
all the third-person,
past-tense bullshit?

09:08.381 --> 09:10.919
The Binder had no idea
what she was talking about.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.051
Hmm.

09:13.178 --> 09:16.717
The Binder explained
he had answers,

09:17.432 --> 09:21.927
but it would require
they learn how he came to be.

09:22.020 --> 09:23.761
To be...

09:25.023 --> 09:26.355
To be...

09:29.778 --> 09:31.735
The Binder felt dizzy.

09:32.864 --> 09:34.105
His book was a...

09:35.867 --> 09:38.109
Oh, it was somehow...

09:38.203 --> 09:39.944
It was somehow...

09:41.372 --> 09:43.034
Missing pages.

09:44.626 --> 09:45.786
I think he's broken.

09:48.379 --> 09:49.961
The fuck?

09:52.050 --> 09:53.211
When did this happen?

09:53.301 --> 09:54.301
I don't know.

09:54.385 --> 09:57.048
He was talking normal
a second ago.

09:57.889 --> 10:00.632
Normal for him.
My God.

10:14.614 --> 10:15.980
What the hell?

10:26.459 --> 10:27.666
Fen? Tick?

10:27.752 --> 10:29.664
Guys, the weirdest thing
just happened.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.746
I was eating a biscuit,
not off the floor,

10:31.840 --> 10:33.672
<i>and I had a kind of vision.</i>

10:33.758 --> 10:34.999
<i>Still good.</i>

10:39.430 --> 10:40.966
Last looks.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.737
<i>Eating Out
with Josh Hoberman.</i>

10:42.767 --> 10:44.850
Scene one,
take one. Marker.

10:44.936 --> 10:46.598
I'm eating what?

10:47.188 --> 10:49.851
But no one in Fillory has a TV

10:49.941 --> 10:52.854
so why am I questioning this?

10:52.944 --> 10:53.980
Action!

10:54.112 --> 10:57.025
Any baker worth their gluten knows a biscuit

10:57.115 --> 10:58.822
is only as good as its flour.

10:58.908 --> 11:01.776
Add a drizzle
of lavender-infused honey,

11:01.870 --> 11:05.034
and trust me, you'd eat this
right off the floor.

11:11.963 --> 11:15.252
The Winds of Fate.
They've come unseasonably early this year.

11:15.341 --> 11:17.333
I think this is a sign
that Fillory's in trouble.

11:17.427 --> 11:20.761
Early Winds of Fate,
Lorian plants silencing the animals,

11:20.847 --> 11:22.179
too many questing creatures.

11:22.265 --> 11:24.257
Seriously, it sounds
like Fillory's ecosystem

11:24.350 --> 11:26.637
is completely jacked
and not in a sexy way.

11:26.728 --> 11:28.139
Interesting you should
say that.

11:28.229 --> 11:30.061
Not long ago,
we imprisoned a Naiad

11:30.148 --> 11:32.765
for committing moderate acts of
violence against some farmers.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.350
She deboned one of them.

11:35.111 --> 11:37.854
- Really great knife skills.
- Jesus.

11:37.947 --> 11:40.189
Anyway, I recall her
saying something

11:40.283 --> 11:41.468
about Fillory's
failing ecosystem,

11:41.492 --> 11:44.405
but she was covered in guts,
and that's really hard to get past.

11:44.495 --> 11:46.782
- Been there. Get that
- Let's talk to her.

11:47.999 --> 11:49.115
Okay.

11:49.834 --> 11:53.828
Hello, Ismenie.
I brought you some visitors today.

11:56.341 --> 11:57.923
Oh, God!

11:58.009 --> 12:01.173
Am I the only one getting
<i>The Ring/Grudge</i>- type vibes here?

12:01.262 --> 12:02.298
She's a Naiad.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.380
Why do you dry-skins
torture me?

12:05.266 --> 12:07.553
I came to you with a warning.

12:07.644 --> 12:10.512
Yes, yes.
You also attacked several farmers.

12:10.605 --> 12:12.312
That was my warning.

12:12.398 --> 12:16.187
They were stealing my water,
an assault on my very soul.

12:16.277 --> 12:17.563
She protects a well.

12:17.654 --> 12:20.112
What if your blood
lived outside of your skin

12:20.198 --> 12:22.906
and thoughtless things drank it,
bathed in it, peed in it?

12:22.992 --> 12:26.110
Yes, well, I'm afraid we have
a few questions we need to ask

12:26.204 --> 12:28.491
about Fillory's ecosystem.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.289
I told you all before,
it is The Waters.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.117
They are moving.

12:33.211 --> 12:35.498
It is the fault
of the Thirteenth.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.124
The Thirteenth.

12:37.215 --> 12:39.332
The thirsty Thirteenth.

12:39.425 --> 12:42.543
He tried to capture us,
dam us in.

12:43.054 --> 12:45.046
Water should flow free.

12:45.139 --> 12:47.847
What he built,
there is no excuse for it.

12:47.934 --> 12:48.970
What did he build?

12:50.061 --> 12:51.472
We're done here, dry-skins.

12:51.562 --> 12:53.224
No, we are not done here!

12:59.070 --> 13:00.231
Once you're there,

13:00.321 --> 13:02.813
you can't do anything
or say anything to anyone that'll...

13:02.907 --> 13:03.907
Risk changing the past.

13:03.992 --> 13:06.234
I get it.
I've been to the movies.

13:06.577 --> 13:08.034
This is serious, Quentin.

13:08.121 --> 13:11.205
The bridge between your past self
and your present self is...

13:11.291 --> 13:12.623
Is delicate.
If you break it...

13:12.709 --> 13:16.544
Look, as long as you wipe
past me's memory, we'll be fine.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.229
I have a memory charm
ready to go.

13:23.553 --> 13:24.947
We'll set the spell
so it takes you back

13:24.971 --> 13:26.407
to where we were
at Brakebills South.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.468
Just go straight
to Mayakovsky's office

13:28.558 --> 13:31.426
- and don't talk to anyone.
- I won't.

13:47.410 --> 13:50.448
Alice? How did I get up here?

14:02.216 --> 14:03.798
Alice, I...

14:06.512 --> 14:08.094
Oh, um...

14:08.306 --> 14:10.013
Oh, God. Alice...

14:17.357 --> 14:18.357
Mmm-mmm.

14:18.441 --> 14:20.398
Alice, wait.
No, I just have to...

14:20.485 --> 14:22.818
- What's wrong?
- No, no, no. It's fine.

14:22.904 --> 14:23.940
Mmm-mmm.

14:24.030 --> 14:26.613
No, I just... I got to...

14:26.699 --> 14:27.906
What did I do?

14:27.992 --> 14:30.575
You? No, no, it's me.
I'm the problem.

14:30.661 --> 14:31.742
I, um...

14:32.622 --> 14:34.705
Just... I forgot condoms.

14:34.791 --> 14:37.033
So I'm just gonna...

14:44.133 --> 14:46.500
What am I doing
on the table?

14:48.304 --> 14:50.261
Just stand still.

14:50.348 --> 14:52.681
Whose clothes
am I wearing?

14:52.767 --> 14:54.850
Shit, there's no more magic.

14:55.353 --> 14:57.811
Alice, what's going on?
How did we get here?

14:59.357 --> 15:02.566
Uh, I heard that
sometimes Mayakovsky

15:02.652 --> 15:04.735
randomly teleports students
to the lab for testing

15:04.821 --> 15:06.687
to keep us
on our toes.

15:07.698 --> 15:10.406
Uh, okay,
I hadn't heard that, but...

15:10.493 --> 15:12.860
No, no, it's a real thing
that he does.

15:13.496 --> 15:17.206
Uh, look, there must be
some sort of test.

15:18.376 --> 15:19.376
Um...

15:20.253 --> 15:21.494
Knots.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.544
Yeah, we need
to tie these into knots

15:23.631 --> 15:26.214
for magic purposes,
like, for sure.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.838
All right, I guess that could be worse.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.477
Yes?

15:54.287 --> 15:55.994
Hello?

15:56.080 --> 15:58.572
Oh, thank Christ.
I didn't think I'd get through.

15:58.666 --> 16:01.454
The phones here work off
of GPS coordinates, not numbers.

16:01.544 --> 16:03.661
Well, you were close.

16:03.754 --> 16:06.246
Listen, I don't have
a lot of time.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.127
<i>We need your help.</i>

16:09.218 --> 16:11.426
Surviving
first-year students...

16:15.099 --> 16:16.806
I'm here

16:19.520 --> 16:21.056
to teach you

16:21.856 --> 16:23.597
what not to do.

16:24.567 --> 16:28.436
Let's begin with a cloaking spell,
shall we?

16:28.529 --> 16:32.773
Which, unfortunately,
you will never do

16:32.867 --> 16:35.826
because the Library,

16:35.912 --> 16:38.120
they don't want you
to know it.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.463
Did you see that?

16:48.549 --> 16:50.791
Now forget it,
because if you learn it,

16:50.885 --> 16:53.423
you'll be
in very, very serious trouble.

16:53.513 --> 16:54.799
Damn it!

16:54.889 --> 16:56.630
Good God!

16:57.767 --> 16:59.599
Cock shit!

16:59.685 --> 17:01.176
Surely you didn't come here

17:01.270 --> 17:03.683
just to gossip about Phyllis.

17:03.773 --> 17:05.876
You don't think her perfumes
are a danger to the books?

17:05.900 --> 17:09.644
I think she smokes
and doesn't want anyone to know.

17:10.238 --> 17:11.569
But we all do.

17:13.241 --> 17:15.153
It's good to see you smiling.

17:15.409 --> 17:16.775
Been worried about you.

17:17.578 --> 17:19.319
You seem distant lately.

17:20.205 --> 17:21.867
I wondered
if something had happened.

17:23.084 --> 17:25.326
If anything were wrong,
I'd tell you.

17:25.419 --> 17:26.785
You would.

17:26.878 --> 17:29.417
Well, I'm here for you.
You know that, right?

17:33.594 --> 17:35.085
Yes?

17:35.888 --> 17:39.302
Sorry to interrupt,
but there has been an incident.

17:39.392 --> 17:40.758
It's Fogg.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.179
Perhaps it's time
for someone to talk to him

17:45.273 --> 17:47.686
- who isn't a friend.
- Of course.

17:49.777 --> 17:51.234
- Thank you for the tea.
- Mmm-hmm.

18:09.005 --> 18:10.291
Where the hell
did Margo go?

18:10.381 --> 18:12.543
I thought
she came in here.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.374
What's with
the honeymoon suite?

18:18.222 --> 18:19.713
Huh, that was, uh...

18:23.644 --> 18:26.182
You didn't do that, did you?

18:26.272 --> 18:28.104
I can't do that.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.104
Okay, seriously?

18:33.029 --> 18:34.065
Margo?

18:34.697 --> 18:36.404
Margo?

18:36.490 --> 18:39.824
Some weird-ass ghost
shoved me in a closet.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.367
Yeah.

18:41.454 --> 18:44.572
I can see your non-corporeal
panty-sniffing ass

18:44.665 --> 18:46.907
with my goddamn fairy eye.

18:47.001 --> 18:49.744
- Ghost?
- Or whatevs.

18:49.837 --> 18:51.794
He keeps shaking his head.

18:53.466 --> 18:54.923
I can't hear you.

18:55.593 --> 18:57.755
Keeps pointing at you
for some reason.

19:06.270 --> 19:09.308
Penny 23.

19:09.398 --> 19:12.141
Isn't this just berries?

19:19.033 --> 19:22.151
I'm here because
you changed my life, Penny.

19:22.912 --> 19:26.826
I mean, not you, Penny 40.
But basically you.

19:27.416 --> 19:31.456
When he died/became
my astral best friend...

19:31.587 --> 19:33.795
- Yeah, I seriously doubt that.
- Oh, my.

19:33.881 --> 19:37.500
You sound just like P-40
right now. Whoa.

19:38.260 --> 19:39.488
Can we get to the part
where you explain

19:39.512 --> 19:41.344
- why you're here, please.
- Welp.

19:41.430 --> 19:42.841
You guys
are my favorite characters.

19:42.932 --> 19:44.844
Only you disappeared.

19:44.934 --> 19:47.096
So, I left Brakebills
to find out what happened.

19:47.186 --> 19:50.770
And when I did, hoo-boy,
this plot was a mess.

19:50.856 --> 19:51.937
You mean my life?

19:52.775 --> 19:55.483
And I realized,
I'm done watching.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.936
I want to participate.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.818
And you... The other you...

20:00.908 --> 20:03.821
Great twist...
Showed me how to do that.

20:03.911 --> 20:07.075
Turns out I can be stuff

20:07.164 --> 20:09.451
at a level
I never imagined possible.

20:09.542 --> 20:12.876
Is that why Margo
is tied up in a closet

20:12.962 --> 20:16.330
and you're lighting candles,
playing sexy music?

20:17.883 --> 20:19.749
Patience, Kemosabe.

20:19.844 --> 20:21.380
I'll get there.

20:22.513 --> 20:23.674
Yeah, that's offensive.

20:23.764 --> 20:25.847
But I thought you were Indian?

20:25.975 --> 20:28.137
- What?
- Anyhootch, I had a thought.

20:28.227 --> 20:32.437
I... I mean, in my day,
you two would sip a little giggle water

20:32.523 --> 20:36.392
and get a wiggle on,
but instead we're just...

20:37.278 --> 20:40.362
Waiting. Yawn.

20:40.448 --> 20:43.361
You mean all this insane shit
that is happening

20:43.451 --> 20:45.408
is to get me and Julia
to hook up?

20:45.494 --> 20:48.407
I mean after that little naked interlude
in Fillory...

20:48.497 --> 20:50.033
- You watched that?
- Yeah.

20:50.124 --> 20:52.366
I know a true thing when I see it,
buster, and you're it.

20:52.460 --> 20:56.374
Listen, Hyman, if you stole
the pages from the Binder,

20:56.464 --> 20:58.877
we need them back. Now.

20:58.966 --> 21:01.504
Or I will sic Margo on you.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.970
Maybe I overstepped,

21:05.055 --> 21:09.390
but you just gotta understand
I see what you and Julia keep doing

21:09.477 --> 21:11.639
and I worry
about the both of you.

21:11.937 --> 21:13.144
What are we doing?

21:14.815 --> 21:19.526
You both sacrifice
your own joy to help others.

21:19.612 --> 21:23.196
Julia gave up all that power,
and you...

21:23.282 --> 21:26.525
I mean, other Penny
died because of it.

21:26.619 --> 21:29.737
Yeah, when I think about it,
it's a sad twist.

21:30.164 --> 21:32.656
You can't blame me for wanting
the two of you to be happy,

21:33.417 --> 21:37.081
because you will
never do it for yourself.

21:41.967 --> 21:45.085
Hey, wet 'n' wild, you said everything's
the fault of the Thirteenth

21:45.179 --> 21:47.546
But all mention of him
has been stricken from the archives.

21:47.640 --> 21:50.599
I'm not a conspiracy theorist,
but I'm workin' on a theory

21:50.684 --> 21:52.175
there might be a conspiracy.

21:52.269 --> 21:55.262
Somebody erased this guy
magically.

21:55.815 --> 21:58.603
But you know his name,
don't you?

21:58.692 --> 22:00.433
I will not speak it.

22:00.528 --> 22:02.520
Oh, yes, you will.

22:02.613 --> 22:03.899
Wait, what are you doing?

22:03.989 --> 22:05.855
I went all the way
to your well,

22:05.950 --> 22:07.636
and if you don't tell us
what we need to know

22:07.660 --> 22:10.403
I am going to drink it
and then I'm going to pee it

22:10.496 --> 22:11.723
and then Josh
is going to drink it.

22:11.747 --> 22:13.579
Yeah! Wait, what?

22:13.666 --> 22:16.033
- You monster!
- Tick, you can't do this.

22:16.126 --> 22:17.437
Dude, yeah,
that's sort of like torture.

22:17.461 --> 22:18.661
I thought we were
against that.

22:18.712 --> 22:20.669
- We are.
- She's the only one who knows the name

22:20.756 --> 22:22.793
of the Thirteenth King
and she is gonna tell us!

22:22.883 --> 22:24.090
Please, please! You can't.

22:24.176 --> 22:25.462
No!

22:26.178 --> 22:27.714
Ram's bottom, what was it?

22:27.972 --> 22:29.383
The Thirteenth,
the Thirteenth...

22:29.473 --> 22:31.760
It's Roderick!
"Thirsty Roderick,

22:31.851 --> 22:35.015
"thirteenth of his line,
always liked to have a good time."

22:35.104 --> 22:36.265
Oh, my God, you're right.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.847
- About what?
- A nursery rhyme.

22:38.941 --> 22:40.043
I've been trying
to remember it all day.

22:40.067 --> 22:41.979
We used to sing it
while playing Bearskip.

22:42.069 --> 22:44.652
It's a children's game,
sort of like Fillorian hopscotch.

22:44.738 --> 22:47.481
- Involving bears?
- Ideally skipping them.

22:47.575 --> 22:50.443
"He hides his drink
from his many daughters."

22:50.536 --> 22:52.243
"Builds a cistern
to hoard the waters."

22:52.329 --> 22:53.991
"Underneath the castle fair."

22:54.081 --> 22:56.323
"If you jump,
you'll skip the bear!"

22:56.417 --> 22:57.578
Okay.

22:57.668 --> 22:59.455
Your nursery rhyme
used the word "cistern"?

22:59.545 --> 23:00.897
Well, how else are children
supposed to learn

23:00.921 --> 23:02.833
about underground
water containment systems?

23:02.923 --> 23:05.415
- You people are sick.
- Wait.

23:05.509 --> 23:08.547
He built underground
water containment systems?

23:08.637 --> 23:11.505
Ismenie, you said,
"The Waters, they are moving."

23:11.599 --> 23:13.215
But were you really
talking about water?

23:13.309 --> 23:15.426
She's always talking
about water.

23:15.519 --> 23:17.135
Unless she's talking
about magic.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.972
A huge reservoir of magic,
hidden underneath the castle.

23:20.065 --> 23:22.265
That could be what's causing
all the stuff we're seeing.

23:22.318 --> 23:24.651
Wait, wait.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.691
I think I know
how we can get to it.

23:27.990 --> 23:28.990
Follow me!

23:30.117 --> 23:31.449
Okay.

23:32.620 --> 23:33.906
God, it hurts!

23:34.997 --> 23:36.283
An incorporate bond?

23:36.373 --> 23:37.909
Why do you suddenly
need to know this?

23:38.709 --> 23:41.372
Uh, it's just something
that I've been wondering about.

23:41.462 --> 23:42.578
You're serious?

23:42.671 --> 23:47.541
You could be having fox sex
with your partner, the better Magician.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.214
I realize that.

23:50.304 --> 23:52.011
She could do incorporate bond.

23:52.723 --> 23:55.682
And she's chosen to have sex
with you for some reason.

23:55.768 --> 23:59.637
You should be having as much
sex with her as you can

23:59.730 --> 24:01.187
before she realizes.

24:01.273 --> 24:02.980
Thank you
for the relationship advice,

24:03.067 --> 24:06.401
an area that I'm sure
that you are an expert in.

24:06.487 --> 24:10.697
Oh, little pushback
from B-minus student.

24:10.908 --> 24:13.150
- I like this.
- I'm just saying,

24:13.243 --> 24:16.327
there is something
that you are an actual expert in

24:16.455 --> 24:19.368
- that I need to know about.
- Right.

24:19.458 --> 24:22.917
You "need" to know
how to cast an incorporate bond.

24:26.256 --> 24:29.090
- What is your discipline?
- What?

24:29.176 --> 24:31.088
Your discipline,
B-minus student,

24:31.178 --> 24:33.465
or did you leave that back
in your tiny fox pants?

24:34.640 --> 24:36.097
They tested me.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.092
Inconclusive.

24:39.186 --> 24:40.393
Well, that is a problem.

24:40.479 --> 24:44.723
Can't cast incorporate bond
without your discipline.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.558
There's got to be
some kind of workaround.

24:46.652 --> 24:47.652
Nope.

24:48.404 --> 24:50.066
Come back
when you're fully formed.

24:50.155 --> 24:51.883
Come on. There's got to be
something that you can do.

24:51.907 --> 24:52.907
I need this.

24:56.286 --> 24:58.243
Fine. Drink that.

25:00.332 --> 25:01.948
This will help
with the test or...

25:02.042 --> 25:05.661
It will kill brain cells.
I have plenty to spare.

25:05.754 --> 25:07.916
You don't, but...

25:09.425 --> 25:10.836
I don't want to drink alone.

25:17.599 --> 25:19.682
So this is it, huh?

25:19.852 --> 25:22.765
Before we go in,
there's a small matter of protection.

25:36.285 --> 25:38.948
- Swallow it.
- Well, what is it?

25:39.371 --> 25:40.407
Insects.

25:46.211 --> 25:47.998
Don't chew. They have
to go down whole

25:48.088 --> 25:50.831
so they can eat any poison
you take into your bloodstream.

26:00.059 --> 26:02.597
The bugs only last an hour,
so we need to be quick.

26:30.005 --> 26:31.858
There is something
you're not telling me.

26:31.882 --> 26:34.465
What? No, that's not true.

26:34.551 --> 26:36.884
You're a very bad liar,
B-minus.

26:36.970 --> 26:39.587
More like D-plus on this.

26:43.310 --> 26:45.267
And I don't have
to tell you anything

26:45.938 --> 26:48.100
until you tell me
what you're hiding.

26:50.776 --> 26:51.776
It's complicated.

26:53.028 --> 26:55.566
You're from future, yes?

26:56.698 --> 26:57.698
What?

27:01.954 --> 27:05.868
What is in there is older
than what is in there.

27:08.669 --> 27:11.628
Yeah. Yes, fine. I am.

27:11.713 --> 27:14.922
I... Not me, me,
but my consciousness.

27:15.008 --> 27:17.216
I came here to ask you
about incorporate bonds.

27:17.302 --> 27:19.544
Why didn't you ask me
in your time?

27:20.347 --> 27:22.088
I am dead or something?

27:22.182 --> 27:24.299
No. Look, I can't tell you
anything else.

27:24.393 --> 27:25.929
I can't risk messing
with the past.

27:26.145 --> 27:28.478
Blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah,

27:28.564 --> 27:30.772
I've seen
<i>Back to the Future.</i>

27:33.944 --> 27:36.652
You want to fuck your mother
in past?

27:37.489 --> 27:40.323
- What? No.
- Why? She not attractive?

27:40.409 --> 27:44.198
Look. I just can't tell you any more
about how I did this...

27:44.288 --> 27:47.622
I already know.
You use timeshare spell.

27:47.708 --> 27:49.324
I've been working on it.

27:50.419 --> 27:51.830
Clearly I must have
finished it.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.411
And don't worry.

27:54.298 --> 27:55.914
Future is safe.

27:56.008 --> 27:59.501
Everything you say
is in the vault.

28:01.346 --> 28:03.588
This vault.

28:04.766 --> 28:08.806
I will definitely not remember anything
about this conversation

28:08.896 --> 28:11.684
like most conversations
I have with students

28:11.773 --> 28:13.605
like you, D-plus.

28:37.049 --> 28:39.086
This basis
for incorporate bond.

28:41.178 --> 28:42.510
We are done here.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.390
You never told me
my discipline.

28:52.439 --> 28:54.431
Repair of small objects.

28:56.568 --> 28:57.568
Really?

28:57.653 --> 28:58.894
Hope we did not ruin

28:58.987 --> 29:03.948
your big plans after you get back
to your mysterious future,

29:05.535 --> 29:07.276
Mr. Time Traveler.

29:10.457 --> 29:12.540
Tell my older self...

29:14.002 --> 29:15.002
"Well done."

29:21.468 --> 29:22.468
Um...

29:24.179 --> 29:25.179
Shit.

29:29.476 --> 29:31.012
Alice.

29:31.561 --> 29:32.802
What the hell, Q?

29:34.189 --> 29:35.270
What did you cast?

29:36.024 --> 29:39.108
Some sort of spell
to make your future self

29:39.194 --> 29:41.402
take over
your past self's body?

29:41.738 --> 29:44.025
What happens that made you
have to do this?

29:44.116 --> 29:45.448
I can't tell you that.

29:45.534 --> 29:47.651
Well, can you talk
about what's happening with us?

29:49.830 --> 29:51.913
Of course you can't.
Paradox rules apply.

29:51.999 --> 29:53.991
I can't risk
changing the past.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.876
I could get lost forever.

29:57.004 --> 30:00.418
- I could do a memory charm.
- Alice.

30:00.507 --> 30:03.591
I know one that will erase my memory
for the last hour.

30:07.723 --> 30:10.306
Okay. Yeah, sure.

30:11.184 --> 30:12.184
Why?

30:12.269 --> 30:14.226
So we can talk about the way
you looked at me

30:14.313 --> 30:15.313
when you came back.

30:17.316 --> 30:18.397
There was so much

30:19.901 --> 30:20.982
pain.

30:22.321 --> 30:23.937
A lot of things
have happened.

30:25.073 --> 30:26.073
How bad?

30:28.076 --> 30:29.817
Pretty goddamn bad.

30:31.204 --> 30:32.285
What happens?

30:34.082 --> 30:35.914
You, uh, get hurt.

30:38.503 --> 30:39.503
We both do.

30:41.089 --> 30:42.796
So would you rather
I just stop this now

30:42.883 --> 30:44.795
so that we never have
to feel the way you feel?

30:46.928 --> 30:49.045
Look, you're a nice guy, Q,
for trying to warn me.

30:49.181 --> 30:50.297
I'm not trying to...

30:50.390 --> 30:52.131
But I'm not scared
of the future.

30:53.143 --> 30:54.725
I'm scared of losing this.

30:55.729 --> 30:59.143
Maybe it's crazy and hopeless
where you live,

30:59.775 --> 31:01.455
but, you know,
maybe I never told you this,

31:01.777 --> 31:04.736
but you are the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

31:11.912 --> 31:13.073
So,

31:15.290 --> 31:16.406
when you go back,

31:17.542 --> 31:18.953
just remember that, okay?

31:28.637 --> 31:31.755
What do you think
made Mayakovsky so bitter?

31:31.848 --> 31:33.714
- Huh?
- And, like, obsessed

31:33.809 --> 31:38.179
with the vulpine sex
of his two students?

31:38.271 --> 31:40.012
Yeah, it's weird,
isn't it?

31:40.315 --> 31:42.155
No, no, it's totally normal.
He's a normal guy.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.194
These are normal school situations.

31:47.781 --> 31:49.550
Seriously, though,
you think that he would notice

31:49.574 --> 31:51.941
if we stopped
tying these knots?

31:53.537 --> 31:56.701
Probably. We shouldn't.

31:58.166 --> 31:59.166
Hey.

32:00.127 --> 32:01.127
Crazy idea.

32:01.878 --> 32:07.499
What if we stopped
tying the knots and instead we...

32:10.262 --> 32:11.262
Hmm?

32:11.346 --> 32:12.587
- Um...
- Hmm?

32:12.973 --> 32:14.930
Ooh, yeah. We could do it
on the table.

32:15.016 --> 32:17.099
Quentin!

32:20.272 --> 32:23.231
I don't... It was hotter
in my head.

32:25.485 --> 32:27.477
Hmm? Oh.

32:27.571 --> 32:28.687
Sorry, Vix. You okay?

32:28.780 --> 32:30.316
Yeah, no. I'm fine.

32:31.324 --> 32:32.531
Yeah, you are.

32:46.298 --> 32:47.539
That was nice.

32:49.593 --> 32:50.959
- Alice.
- Yeah?

32:51.052 --> 32:53.965
Uh, it's me.
I'm... I'm back.

32:55.390 --> 32:56.390
Oh...

33:14.117 --> 33:16.734
The Binder's story
began in a place

33:17.746 --> 33:18.782
known simply as

33:20.248 --> 33:21.284
the Library.

33:22.209 --> 33:23.575
You were a Librarian?

33:23.668 --> 33:25.125
He did say it started
in the Library.

33:25.212 --> 33:26.372
I mean, it's fucking obvious.

33:26.421 --> 33:28.378
He was studying

33:28.924 --> 33:30.335
the limits of power.

33:32.844 --> 33:36.929
His specialty was the magic
inherent in gods.

33:38.517 --> 33:40.509
Great. A puppet show.

33:40.602 --> 33:41.996
The Binder had a theory.

33:42.020 --> 33:45.184
When a being of great power,
such as a god, is killed,

33:46.066 --> 33:50.106
their energy is lost,
but he believed it could be preserved

33:50.195 --> 33:51.731
by binding it
to an object.

33:51.821 --> 33:53.687
That object, in turn,
could be bound

33:53.782 --> 33:56.570
to a Magician of sufficient
training and preparation,

33:56.660 --> 33:59.323
effectively turning
the Magician into a god.

33:59.412 --> 34:02.075
Yeah, but every time
a mortal tries to kill a god,

34:02.165 --> 34:04.031
all magic gets shut off.

34:04.960 --> 34:07.953
The Binder
politely reminded Margo that

34:08.588 --> 34:10.750
not every story was about her.

34:10.840 --> 34:12.956
So the Binder
is a catty bitch?

34:15.554 --> 34:16.920
He continued.

34:18.223 --> 34:20.931
It was a problem
that perplexed

34:21.016 --> 34:23.350
the Binder
and his fellow Librarians,

34:23.436 --> 34:26.143
but, as it turned out,

34:26.231 --> 34:30.601
the old gods themselves
provided a solution.

34:32.821 --> 34:35.234
Two siblings. Mistakes.

34:35.864 --> 34:38.322
Born with the power
of many gods.

34:38.409 --> 34:41.118
They were created
with one unique quality

34:41.204 --> 34:43.366
that made them essential
to this experiment.

34:43.498 --> 34:46.456
They could not die.

34:48.253 --> 34:50.106
So no matter what you did to them,
it wouldn't trigger

34:50.130 --> 34:51.871
the old gods
to take away magic.

34:51.965 --> 34:54.422
Without fear
of the old gods' retribution,

34:54.509 --> 34:59.095
The Librarians were safe
to move forward with their experiment.

34:59.180 --> 35:00.637
One of the Monsters
was captured,

35:00.724 --> 35:03.057
the older, more dominant one.
The female.

35:03.143 --> 35:04.143
Natch.

35:04.227 --> 35:06.184
The one left behind
would be confused,

35:06.730 --> 35:08.767
afraid, like a child.

35:10.692 --> 35:13.052
Without his sister, he'd have trouble
even remembering them.

35:13.737 --> 35:15.148
What did you do to the sister?

35:20.160 --> 35:21.867
She was split into four parts.

35:21.953 --> 35:24.445
Each part bound in a stone.

35:24.539 --> 35:29.079
Each stone bound
in a Librarian.

35:29.169 --> 35:33.459
Bacchus. Iris.
Heka. Aengus.

35:34.341 --> 35:35.923
Those ballsacks.

35:36.760 --> 35:37.796
When they were finished,

35:39.220 --> 35:41.007
the Binder came to regret
what he had done.

35:43.391 --> 35:47.135
But the new gods he had built
were afraid of him.

35:48.647 --> 35:51.481
He alone held the secret
that could make them human again.

35:51.566 --> 35:52.682
And so...

35:54.653 --> 35:55.939
They cursed him.

35:57.822 --> 35:59.233
They turned you
into a book.

35:59.741 --> 36:02.654
Okay. That does kind of suck.

36:02.744 --> 36:05.987
In that form, he became something
they could control.

36:07.666 --> 36:10.374
Hide from the rest
of The Order, from history.

36:11.002 --> 36:15.167
It was only by chance
that a young Librarian read his book

36:15.256 --> 36:16.918
and was convinced

36:17.008 --> 36:19.170
to hide the Binder
in the Mirror World,

36:19.260 --> 36:21.126
where he hoped no one
would find him again.

36:21.221 --> 36:24.885
Until word reached the Binder
of Julia Wicker,

36:24.974 --> 36:26.931
and her quest.

36:27.018 --> 36:29.726
He knew he had
the answers she sought.

36:30.897 --> 36:33.139
So you can help me
become a goddess again?

36:33.233 --> 36:35.270
He could take her
in either direction.

36:35.360 --> 36:38.353
The godhood, or humanity.

36:39.072 --> 36:40.529
The choice was hers.

36:41.449 --> 36:43.111
Either road would be painful.

36:43.201 --> 36:46.615
He wondered aloud
if she was ready.

36:47.080 --> 36:48.446
You and me both.

36:48.540 --> 36:52.250
The Binder knew she needed time
to consider which way to go.

36:52.877 --> 36:53.913
But either way,

36:56.256 --> 36:58.873
he'd need a favor in return.

37:04.389 --> 37:06.676
He needed her
to burn his book.

37:09.436 --> 37:11.598
He did not want
to be used again.

37:13.773 --> 37:15.139
Like he was before.

37:37.088 --> 37:38.124
I got it.

37:46.848 --> 37:47.848
Do we have time for that?

37:47.932 --> 37:50.595
First thing you learn
in The Order is how to speed read.

38:04.115 --> 38:05.572
Everett's been lying
to all of us.

38:05.825 --> 38:07.691
It's just as we suspected.

38:07.786 --> 38:09.573
He's been hoarding magic.

38:10.914 --> 38:11.914
To do what?

38:12.540 --> 38:13.576
To become a god.

38:16.586 --> 38:18.043
And if this book is correct,

38:19.255 --> 38:20.255
he succeeds.

38:26.596 --> 38:29.304
The floor in this hallway
is laid out

38:29.390 --> 38:31.677
in the exact pattern
of a Bearskip board.

38:31.768 --> 38:34.602
Now, that can't
just be a coincidence.

38:34.687 --> 38:36.474
Can't it though?

38:36.564 --> 38:39.602
Just jump forward
three squares.

38:40.902 --> 38:41.938
Okay.

38:42.362 --> 38:43.773
Not the dragon!

38:43.863 --> 38:46.071
Watch the sloth!

38:46.157 --> 38:47.648
- Now duck.
- Duck?

38:47.784 --> 38:49.867
- There's a bear on your right.
- Seriously?

38:49.953 --> 38:52.286
- That one got my leg.
- Okay!

38:53.206 --> 38:56.415
Oh, no. Don't get me, bear!

38:57.460 --> 38:59.326
Because you successfully
"skipped the bear,"

38:59.420 --> 39:00.956
you get to throw
the sweetberry.

39:01.881 --> 39:04.123
And I throw it
at the last whatever?

39:04.217 --> 39:05.833
The hibernation square.

39:05.927 --> 39:07.543
Okay. Jeez.

39:11.975 --> 39:13.511
Oh, yes! You did it.

39:13.601 --> 39:14.601
Huh.

39:17.605 --> 39:19.892
That is still good.

39:21.985 --> 39:22.985
I say what again?

39:23.069 --> 39:24.981
Oh, right. Right, right.

39:25.321 --> 39:26.321
Honey or die!

39:32.245 --> 39:34.737
- Where does it lead?
- Only one way to find out.

39:36.749 --> 39:37.785
Seriously?

39:37.876 --> 39:38.957
Perfect timing.

39:39.043 --> 39:40.729
We should return
right between shift changes.

39:40.753 --> 39:41.789
That's good.

39:41.880 --> 39:45.339
Is it weird I've had this
chocolate taste in my mouth?

39:45.425 --> 39:48.759
As the bugs absorb more poison,
the aftertaste changes.

39:49.304 --> 39:51.144
It's when you taste mint
we're in real trouble.

39:53.099 --> 39:54.215
Okay.

40:00.565 --> 40:01.897
It's locked.

40:01.983 --> 40:02.983
Don't you have the key?

40:03.443 --> 40:05.105
The key is for the other side.

40:05.820 --> 40:06.981
Someone locked us in.

40:08.323 --> 40:09.439
I have worse news.

40:10.867 --> 40:12.028
I just tasted mint.

40:14.037 --> 40:15.037
Hmm.

40:17.457 --> 40:18.573
You think Hyman
is right?

40:19.709 --> 40:20.709
What he said about us?

40:21.544 --> 40:23.706
God, I don't know if that man
has any fucking clue

40:23.796 --> 40:26.960
what's going on, but maybe.

40:27.926 --> 40:30.293
'Cause I've been thinking
about becoming a goddess a lot.

40:31.054 --> 40:33.467
How to do it without screwing up
like the other gods did.

40:34.891 --> 40:35.927
I don't know.

40:36.559 --> 40:38.972
Maybe I should give
some airtime to the alternative.

40:39.354 --> 40:40.354
Becoming human?

40:43.983 --> 40:45.099
I mean being happy.

40:46.361 --> 40:47.361
Okay.

40:49.447 --> 40:51.814
Pros and cons.
You become a goddess,

40:53.201 --> 40:54.442
you get all powered up.

40:55.328 --> 40:56.489
Maybe help in the fight.

40:57.664 --> 40:59.030
You become human...

40:59.499 --> 41:00.706
I get to feel things.

41:01.292 --> 41:03.079
Yeah, like hunger.

41:04.003 --> 41:06.837
- And sadness and...
- And this...

41:18.559 --> 41:20.642
Was that a pro or a con?

41:29.153 --> 41:30.234
I have a problem.

41:32.240 --> 41:33.276
She's dying.

41:33.366 --> 41:34.402
Who's dying?

41:35.034 --> 41:36.034
My sister.

41:36.619 --> 41:38.110
I found her a body,

41:39.163 --> 41:40.950
but it's not strong enough.

41:42.709 --> 41:47.374
I need to find one
that is more durable.

41:49.007 --> 41:50.007
Like yours.

41:56.973 --> 42:00.432
So, Mayakovsky told you
what your discipline is?

42:03.479 --> 42:07.348
Repair of small objects.

42:09.110 --> 42:11.352
You did always excel
at minor mendings.

42:12.238 --> 42:13.878
I always thought
it'd be something cooler.

42:14.282 --> 42:15.568
At least it's real.

42:16.659 --> 42:19.026
Now you don't have to fantasize
anymore about who you are

42:20.246 --> 42:21.782
and lie about
who you wish you were.

42:21.873 --> 42:23.865
You just know it now.

42:25.877 --> 42:27.618
And maybe
you've always known it.

42:31.799 --> 42:33.131
Show me.

43:13.883 --> 43:14.964
How does it feel?

43:15.676 --> 43:17.588
Like I helped it wake up

43:18.554 --> 43:20.591
and remember
what it was before.
