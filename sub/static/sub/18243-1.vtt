00:04.738 --> 00:07.038
Last season on
"Just Add Magic"...

00:07.108 --> 00:09.438
- What is it?
- It's a cookbook.

00:09.510 --> 00:10.540
My grandma's.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.981
Grandma and I never made
any of these recipes.

00:13.047 --> 00:14.817
These are totally magical.

00:14.882 --> 00:17.652
Kelly: Grandma isn't sick.
She's under a magic spell.

00:17.718 --> 00:20.048
I know that the cure
is in the cookbook.

00:20.121 --> 00:22.091
The magic has
a mind of its own.

00:22.156 --> 00:23.756
There's never not been
a downside.

00:25.359 --> 00:29.529
You are dealing with
powerful forces
you cannot control.

00:29.597 --> 00:32.097
I gave the book to
your grandmother and
her friends.

00:32.165 --> 00:35.196
I hope you will be
wiser than they.

00:35.269 --> 00:36.639
This is my curse.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.974
When I play
outside my house,
no one can hear me.

00:39.039 --> 00:43.339
I haven't been able to
leave Saffron Falls
for over 40 years.

00:43.411 --> 00:45.851
Hopefully,
together we can help
your grandmother.

00:45.913 --> 00:48.853
Mama P never had
any intention of helping
Grandma Quinn.

00:48.916 --> 00:52.216
It was always about
breaking her own curse.

00:53.221 --> 00:55.721
So long, suckers!

00:55.789 --> 00:57.729
Jake.

00:57.791 --> 00:58.761
He's frozen.

00:58.826 --> 01:00.626
Everybody's frozen.

01:00.694 --> 01:05.233
Kelly:
I think it wants us to
create our own recipe.

01:05.299 --> 01:08.439
I believe in our cake.
I believe in us.

01:08.502 --> 01:12.472
Hannah:
That cake unfroze the town,
brought Kelly's grandma back,

01:12.540 --> 01:14.310
and broke
Miss Silvers' curse.

01:14.375 --> 01:16.005
What if all curses
are broken.

01:16.144 --> 01:18.484
We spent years
trying to bring him back.

01:18.546 --> 01:20.746
Are you talking about
Chuck Hankins?

01:20.814 --> 01:22.424
I'm telling you,
he took a bite,

01:22.483 --> 01:25.523
and then just disappeared
into thin air.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.216
Grandma Quinn:
If Chuck's back,

01:27.288 --> 01:28.818
nobody's safe.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.755
Kelly, you haven't
touched your cake.

01:36.830 --> 01:40.030
There was a lot of...
cake at the pluot festival.

01:40.168 --> 01:41.198
It's delicious.

01:41.269 --> 01:42.969
Well, you can thank
your dad.

01:43.036 --> 01:45.006
He's the one
who picked it up from
the grocery store.

01:45.072 --> 01:46.372
I got it from
the fancy section.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.880
Another piece, Mom?

01:48.942 --> 01:51.512
Mom, answer me.
Are-- are you--

01:51.579 --> 01:52.909
I'm fine, Scott.

01:52.980 --> 01:55.250
You didn't answer me.
I thought you were--

01:55.316 --> 01:57.416
I was taking
a sip of water.

01:57.485 --> 02:00.715
I'm sorry, it's just--
I'm still so shocked.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.888
How do we know
you're back for good?

02:02.956 --> 02:04.586
I am. Trust me.

02:04.658 --> 02:06.528
Can we have cake
every day now?

02:06.594 --> 02:08.204
Mm, I don't know
about that,

02:08.229 --> 02:10.559
but how about
a game of Monopoly?

02:10.631 --> 02:11.631
I'm the shoe.

02:11.699 --> 02:14.269
Oh, you're gonna have to
play without me.

02:14.335 --> 02:15.895
Why? Are you
feeling sick?

02:15.969 --> 02:17.909
Everything's fine.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.111
In fact,
it's just perfect.

02:20.208 --> 02:22.578
I just want to
get some sleep.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.683
So, thank you
for the party.

02:24.745 --> 02:27.575
Tomorrow,
I'll whup all of you
in Monopoly,

02:27.648 --> 02:29.748
and I get to be
the shoe.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.357
Grandma.

02:35.423 --> 02:37.023
What are we gonna do
about Chuck?

02:37.090 --> 02:39.960
Don't worry about it.
We'll figure it out tomorrow.

02:40.027 --> 02:43.357
But you said
if Chuck's back,
then no one's safe.

02:43.431 --> 02:45.701
I just overreacted.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.336
Let's just get
some sleep tonight.

02:50.000 --> 02:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:26.274 --> 03:28.984
Chuck.

03:36.717 --> 03:37.947
Gina: Hold on.

03:38.018 --> 03:40.418
You're sure it was him?
You didn't see his face.

03:40.488 --> 03:42.088
It was him, Gina.

03:42.155 --> 03:45.185
It doesn't seem possible.
He's been gone 50 years.

03:45.293 --> 03:46.763
Ordinarily,
I'd agree with you,

03:46.827 --> 03:48.697
but I never thought I'd see
an entire town

03:48.762 --> 03:50.962
freeze before my eyes,
either.

03:51.031 --> 03:52.771
You shouldn't have
gone out there alone,
Grandma.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.403
If Chuck is dangerous, then
you could have gotten hurt.

03:55.469 --> 03:56.939
Don't worry about me.

03:57.004 --> 03:59.214
If he's out there,
then we need to find him.

03:59.307 --> 04:01.737
Yes, and fast.

04:01.809 --> 04:03.439
I had a feeling
you were gonna say that.

04:06.714 --> 04:11.024
Wow. I haven't seen that
in a long time.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.324
May I?

04:14.788 --> 04:18.327
It's so strange
holding it again
after all these years.

04:26.334 --> 04:29.074
It's like old times.

04:29.136 --> 04:31.136
"Miso-Person's Soup."

04:31.204 --> 04:34.814
"The person you seek
will appear in the broth
crystal clear.

04:34.875 --> 04:37.875
"You will know where they are,
be it far or near."

04:37.945 --> 04:40.475
Okay. That's cool.
It's like a crystal ball.

04:40.548 --> 04:42.518
Yes. Way cool.

04:42.583 --> 04:47.893
Werpoes, lapsis, tofu.
I think we have all of
the ingredients.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.085
Except one.

04:49.156 --> 04:50.786
What's a grunde fingerroot?

04:50.858 --> 04:53.588
Grunde? I've never
heard of that before.

04:53.661 --> 04:56.361
The grunde family
are vision spices.

04:56.397 --> 04:58.997
That will allow us to
see Chuck in the broth.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.166
So where do we get it?

05:00.368 --> 05:01.598
It grows in my garden.

05:01.669 --> 05:03.599
Honestly, I've never had
a reason to use it.

05:03.671 --> 05:05.211
Well, you do now.
Let's go get it.

05:05.272 --> 05:06.772
It's not that easy.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.480
The root
can only be harvested
one day a year.

05:09.543 --> 05:11.683
- What? When?
- Halloween.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.846
It's only May.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.845
We can't wait 'til Fall.

05:16.917 --> 05:19.847
Who knows what damage
Chuck could do by then.

05:19.920 --> 05:23.720
It's okay.
We can find another way
to locate Chuck.

05:23.791 --> 05:24.861
Somehow.

05:33.000 --> 05:33.970
What took so long?

05:34.034 --> 05:35.404
Darbie walks slow.

05:36.637 --> 05:37.837
What's the big news?

05:37.905 --> 05:38.965
I found a spell.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.209
I was flipping through
the book,

05:40.273 --> 05:41.413
and it landed on this.

05:41.409 --> 05:43.409
Hannah:
"Pick-A-Date Dates."

05:43.477 --> 05:45.577
First of all,
I don't eat dates.

05:45.646 --> 05:46.876
You can make
an exception.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.777
This will allow us to
go back in time.

05:48.849 --> 05:51.179
Pick a date.
We can go back
to Halloween,

05:51.251 --> 05:53.221
and get the grunde fingerroot
from Miss Silvers' garden.

05:53.286 --> 05:56.156
And then we can come back and
make the Miso-Person's Soup,

05:56.223 --> 05:57.293
and find Chuck.

05:57.425 --> 05:59.755
Okay.
Best spell ever.

05:59.827 --> 06:01.427
But if we're going
back in time,

06:01.429 --> 06:03.159
I say we go see
dinosaurs.

06:03.230 --> 06:05.930
How will that help us get
the grunde fingerroot?

06:05.999 --> 06:08.839
Maybe they had Halloween
in dinosaur times?

06:08.902 --> 06:10.702
Well, maybe they did,

06:10.771 --> 06:13.941
but Miss Silvers
wasn't around
in dinosaur times.

06:14.007 --> 06:16.007
Let's just go back
to last year.

06:16.076 --> 06:17.106
Last year?

06:17.177 --> 06:19.477
Oh, that was
a bad Halloween.

06:19.547 --> 06:21.177
Yeah, I didn't like
my costume.

06:21.248 --> 06:24.118
And somebody pushed me
into the jelly bean display
at Mama P's,

06:24.184 --> 06:25.594
which was totally
embarrassing.

06:25.653 --> 06:27.663
I know, and Hannah
went home sick,

06:27.721 --> 06:30.321
but at least we know
what to expect.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.458
This whole thing
just feels dangerous.

06:32.526 --> 06:35.526
Not as dangerous as
having Chuck running around.

06:35.596 --> 06:38.296
I really don't think
we should do this.

06:38.365 --> 06:39.465
Well, what about
your grandma?

06:39.500 --> 06:40.630
What did she say?

06:40.701 --> 06:43.271
I, um--
I didn't tell her.

06:43.336 --> 06:45.706
She just got back to normal
and has enough stress

06:45.773 --> 06:47.613
worrying about Chuck.

06:47.675 --> 06:50.475
Okay, you're right.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.014
It's up to us.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.249
I agree.

06:53.313 --> 06:56.123
But I still think
seeing dinosaurs
would be cooler.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.891
Okay, I-- I think
we have everything,

06:59.953 --> 07:01.593
but there isn't
a riddle.

07:01.655 --> 07:03.215
But the riddle's
my favourite part.

07:03.290 --> 07:04.760
Wait, what's this?

07:04.825 --> 07:06.885
It's just a bunch of notes
scribbled in German.

07:09.563 --> 07:11.833
Kelly:
[reading in German]

07:11.899 --> 07:14.499
Here, I'll run it through
my translator app.

07:17.538 --> 07:20.768
I think this is
the riddle, guys.

07:20.841 --> 07:23.741
"Back in time you go,
date any you pick.

07:23.811 --> 07:27.211
"Half to go,
half to come back.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.180
"One way ticket this is.

07:29.249 --> 07:31.349
"Nine more chances you have."

07:31.418 --> 07:32.688
Yes.

07:32.753 --> 07:33.693
That doesn't rhyme.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.194
It's the free version.

07:58.111 --> 08:00.011
Okay, remember,
the important thing is

08:00.080 --> 08:02.380
we eat half to get there
and half to get back.

08:02.449 --> 08:04.549
So do not lose it,
Darbie.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.545
Maybe you should
hold onto it for me,

08:06.554 --> 08:08.864
just in case.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.560
Okay, here we go.

08:11.592 --> 08:13.962
Take us to
last Halloween.

08:23.070 --> 08:24.740
Did it work?

08:24.805 --> 08:27.305
I don't think so.
Everything looks the same.

08:27.374 --> 08:29.114
But we followed
the recipe.

08:31.278 --> 08:32.607
Yes!

08:33.981 --> 08:35.381
I thought you'd be
a little scared.

08:35.448 --> 08:39.018
Sorry, Dad.
You were very
frightening.

08:39.086 --> 08:42.186
Hopefully not too scary.
I don't want to upset
the trick-or-treaters.

08:42.255 --> 08:44.215
I wouldn't worry.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.361
Well,
I'm off to the store
to buy more candy.

08:46.426 --> 08:48.026
You always buy
too much, Dad,

08:48.095 --> 08:50.455
especially last year.

08:50.598 --> 08:52.968
I mean, this year.

08:53.033 --> 08:56.503
I know, but this way
there'll be plenty left over.

08:56.604 --> 08:58.744
For me.

09:02.175 --> 09:03.235
So now what?

09:03.310 --> 09:04.880
We better get to
Miss Silvers'.

09:04.945 --> 09:07.875
Let me grab a sweater, though.
I'm dressed for summer.

09:07.948 --> 09:10.148
Kelly: We don't need
a map, Darbie.

09:10.217 --> 09:12.347
Well, we don't have time
to waste on houses

09:12.419 --> 09:14.089
that pass out
generic candy.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.164
Hey, why isn't my house
on the map?

09:16.223 --> 09:17.263
I love your parents,

09:17.324 --> 09:19.764
but carrot packs
are not candy.

09:21.528 --> 09:24.158
That was close.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.431
We almost ran into
our past selves.

09:26.499 --> 09:28.069
How could we not
think of this?

09:28.135 --> 09:31.065
Yeah.
That would seriously
scar me for life.

09:31.138 --> 09:33.838
I have an idea.
Come on.

09:49.857 --> 09:51.487
I really think
I should have been
the bear.

09:51.558 --> 09:53.128
You know
I love bears.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.563
But Darbie,
you wanted to be
the knight.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.103
I didn't see
the bear.

09:57.164 --> 09:59.074
Guys, we did our best.
It's Halloween night,

09:59.132 --> 10:00.402
all the good costumes
were gone.

10:00.467 --> 10:01.767
Let's just focus.

10:01.835 --> 10:04.195
Fine, but next year,
I get to be the bear.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.911
I love bears.

10:05.973 --> 10:07.983
Okay, I'll get
the grunde root

10:08.041 --> 10:09.981
while you guys keep
Miss Silvers busy.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.788
Are you guys actually
trick-or-treating
at Silvers' house?

10:17.851 --> 10:19.221
Yeah.
She's a witch.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.886
Well, not exactly.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.755
I wouldn't eat anything
she gives you.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.164
What do you think
you're doing?

10:25.225 --> 10:27.555
TP-ing Silvers'.
It's a tradition.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.227
Well, not this year.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.696
Yeah.
Leave her alone.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.804
Or we'll tell her
what you were going to do.

10:32.866 --> 10:36.096
Who knows what
that crazy witch
will do to you.

10:40.540 --> 10:42.040
Poor Miss Silvers.

10:42.109 --> 10:43.909
Everyone thinks
she's scary.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.207
Well, so did we
last year.

10:46.279 --> 10:49.379
I mean, I still think
she's kind of scary.

10:50.483 --> 10:51.793
But she means well.

10:51.852 --> 10:53.822
Come on,
let's go.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.268
What do you want?

11:09.336 --> 11:10.296
Trick or treat.

11:10.370 --> 11:11.770
I know what
you're up to.

11:11.839 --> 11:13.739
You're going to
TP my house.

11:13.741 --> 11:17.511
No. We're just walking
around the neighbourhood
for Halloween.

11:17.577 --> 11:18.747
Trick or treat.

11:21.581 --> 11:23.781
One sec.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.435
Ooh, mini
peanut butter cups.

11:47.507 --> 11:48.477
Nice.

11:48.541 --> 11:51.081
Well, here,
take more.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.254
I guess I could have
some more.

11:53.313 --> 11:56.453
It's okay, I don't get
many visitors.

11:56.516 --> 11:58.346
I really like
your costumes.

11:58.418 --> 12:00.588
The bear is really cute.

12:00.788 --> 12:02.218
Thank you.

12:02.289 --> 12:03.819
Have fun tonight.

12:12.800 --> 12:13.830
Did you get it?

12:13.901 --> 12:17.141
No. Someone took it.

12:17.204 --> 12:20.044
It just doesn't make
any sense.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.077
Maybe Miss Silvers
harvested it
for some reason.

12:22.142 --> 12:23.642
No, I think she would
have told us that

12:23.710 --> 12:26.250
when we
talked about the spell
in her kitchen.

12:26.313 --> 12:27.413
Where are you going?

12:27.480 --> 12:29.620
I'm not travelling
all the way to Halloween

12:29.682 --> 12:31.892
and not getting candy.

12:31.952 --> 12:35.022
Her garden is filled
with secret spices,

12:35.088 --> 12:36.818
it just seems strange
that the one we want

12:36.890 --> 12:39.490
just happens to be
the only one that
someone stole.

12:39.559 --> 12:42.299
Well,
that's the last time
I go to that house.

12:42.362 --> 12:43.262
Look what they gave out.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.370
- Toothpaste?
- Oh, yeah.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.002
That's my dentist's house.

12:47.067 --> 12:49.067
Can I have it?
I love cool mint.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.435
So I guess we should
go home now, huh?

12:54.507 --> 12:57.007
I mean present home,
not past Halloween home.

12:57.077 --> 12:59.207
We can't.
We came here for the
grunde fingerroot,

12:59.279 --> 13:00.449
and we're gonna
find it.

13:00.513 --> 13:02.183
How?

13:02.249 --> 13:04.479
There's only one person
that I can think of

13:04.551 --> 13:05.891
that knows magic,

13:05.953 --> 13:08.463
and would steal something
from Miss Silvers.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.691
All: Mama P.

13:17.197 --> 13:19.127
This year,
I'm gonna win.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.129
All I have to do is
guess how many are in there,

13:21.201 --> 13:22.341
and I'll be eating
jelly beans

13:22.402 --> 13:24.542
for breakfast,
lunch and dinner.

13:24.604 --> 13:26.144
This is so itchy.

13:26.206 --> 13:28.206
I wish Little Red
Riding Hood wore
a sweatshirt.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.475
Yeah, and my stomach
is killing me.

13:30.543 --> 13:32.883
I hope I'm not
coming down with
anything.

13:32.946 --> 13:35.216
Here. Maybe you need to
eat something.

13:35.282 --> 13:37.552
How's a peanut butter cup
going to help my stomach?

13:37.617 --> 13:38.647
How won't it?

13:47.627 --> 13:48.957
Look at Mama P.

13:49.029 --> 13:50.999
Remember how everyone
loved her?

13:51.064 --> 13:52.904
Hannah:
I could see through
her act now.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.373
She's so phony.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.804
I bet those free samples
she's handing out are magical.

13:56.904 --> 13:59.414
To get people to
buy things in her shop.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.272
Still,
they look good.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.911
No, Darbie.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.054
Guys, it's Jake.

14:08.381 --> 14:12.191
Uh, hi.
Welcome to Mama P's,
and happy Halloween.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.492
Would you care for
a mini burrito?
I made them myself.

14:14.554 --> 14:17.524
It's Jake's first time
cooking at the shop.

14:17.590 --> 14:18.590
Thank you, Mama P.

14:18.658 --> 14:19.788
And thanks for
the opportunity.

14:19.927 --> 14:22.097
Nonsense.
Thank you.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.502
Just remember me when
you're a famous chef.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.942
Mm, I could eat your
Jakeritos

14:33.974 --> 14:36.184
for breakfast,
lunch and dinner.

14:36.243 --> 14:38.613
- Jake what-os?
- She means...

14:38.678 --> 14:40.348
they're amazing.

14:41.314 --> 14:42.854
Jakeritos.

14:42.950 --> 14:44.220
I like the sound of that.

14:46.786 --> 14:50.386
Sorry, guys.
This past-present stuff
is confusing.

14:50.457 --> 14:52.327
It's about to get
more confusing.

14:52.392 --> 14:55.162
Look.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.198
Come on.

15:01.368 --> 15:03.098
This is creeping me out.

15:03.170 --> 15:05.740
I know,
look how young we looked.

15:05.805 --> 15:07.135
It was six months ago.

15:07.207 --> 15:10.537
Yeah, but pre-magic Darbie
was much more innocent.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.215
The bumblebee costume
wasn't as bad as I thought.

15:15.282 --> 15:17.252
Okay, we need to get into
the spice cabinet,

15:17.317 --> 15:19.047
get the grunde root,
and get out of here.

15:19.119 --> 15:20.749
How are we gonna
get into the cabinet?

15:20.820 --> 15:22.460
I mean,
this place is packed.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.457
Look.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.034
All: Charlotte.

15:29.096 --> 15:30.726
Great.
That's all we need.

15:30.797 --> 15:32.127
Charlotte.

15:32.199 --> 15:33.999
Great.
That's all we need.

15:34.001 --> 15:35.771
Charlotte.

15:35.835 --> 15:38.505
- Hi, Hannah.
- Happy birthday,
Charlotte.

15:38.571 --> 15:40.041
Thanks.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.307
Nice costume,
Darbie.

15:42.809 --> 15:45.009
Why aren't you at your big
birthday party, Charlotte?

15:45.045 --> 15:46.275
It hasn't started yet.

15:46.346 --> 15:48.446
The haunted house people
are still setting up.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.375
You have
haunted house people?

15:50.450 --> 15:51.680
Yeah.

15:54.421 --> 15:56.661
Ugh, she's so
pretentious.

15:56.723 --> 15:58.493
She's not that bad,
Kell.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.688
You're just upset
'cause she's captain of
the basketball team

16:00.760 --> 16:02.030
and you're not.

16:02.029 --> 16:03.429
I don't want to be
captain.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.826
But if I was, I would
treat people better.

16:05.898 --> 16:07.498
- She's mean.
- Yeah.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.697
Especially when you miss
a three-pointer.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.069
And a lay up.

16:11.138 --> 16:13.408
And pass to
the wrong team.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.743
There's no way
we're gonna to be able
to get in the pantry

16:15.808 --> 16:16.778
without being seen.

16:16.843 --> 16:18.283
Actually, there is.

16:18.345 --> 16:19.605
Remember all the commotion

16:19.679 --> 16:21.509
after I got pushed into
the jelly bean display?

16:21.581 --> 16:23.351
Yeah,
they went everywhere.

16:23.416 --> 16:27.186
When Mama P goes
to clean it up,
we could slip in.

16:27.254 --> 16:28.594
It's gonna happen
any moment now.

16:28.655 --> 16:32.825
Some stupid knight
is gonna push me into the--

16:32.892 --> 16:33.862
Oh.

16:33.926 --> 16:35.296
You know what
you have to do.

16:47.940 --> 16:48.910
How weird.

16:48.975 --> 16:50.705
Actually, not really.

16:50.777 --> 16:53.777
Nice costume.
I'm Dar-bee.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.476
I'm Dar-lene.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.649
You had a chance to go
trick-or-treating yet?

16:58.718 --> 17:01.188
A little bit.
Make sure you avoid
the house on Elmwood

17:01.254 --> 17:02.664
with the big
inflatable witch.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.392
They give out
toothpaste.

17:04.457 --> 17:07.227
And you may want to do
your algebra homework.

17:07.294 --> 17:10.364
There could be
a surprise quiz next week

17:10.430 --> 17:11.760
O-kay.

17:29.782 --> 17:31.552
Come on, come on, hurry.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.818
There's a lot of
spices in here.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.316
Oh. I got it.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.229
I can't believe
some jerk pushed me,

17:38.291 --> 17:39.491
and didn't even
apologise.

17:39.559 --> 17:40.889
Let's just get back to
trick-or-treating.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.900
Oh, my stomach hurts.

17:42.962 --> 17:44.132
Are you okay?

17:44.197 --> 17:45.967
Yeah, I'll be fine.

17:46.032 --> 17:47.332
I just need some rest.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.640
I should go home.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.140
What were you doing
back there?

17:55.175 --> 17:59.275
Uh... looking for
the bathroom.

17:59.346 --> 18:00.746
It's right there.

18:00.813 --> 18:02.553
Under the sign.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.146
Open your bags.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.318
That's not necessary.

18:07.387 --> 18:08.717
We were really
just lost.

18:08.788 --> 18:09.758
Open.

18:25.172 --> 18:27.042
All right.

18:27.174 --> 18:29.614
But that area is for
employees only.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.676
Keep out.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.175
That was close.

18:34.247 --> 18:35.517
Where'd you put
the grunde root?

18:35.582 --> 18:37.322
In the Jack-O-Lantern
bag right--

18:42.222 --> 18:45.192
- Oh, no.
- You put it in my bag?

18:45.192 --> 18:47.862
I mean, not my bag,
but past me's bag?

18:47.927 --> 18:48.897
Come on.

18:54.934 --> 18:56.574
- Darbie!
- Sorry, guys.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.906
I wasn't thinking.
I had to do something
quickly.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.471
It's okay.
We can deal with this.
Hannah went home sick,

19:01.541 --> 19:04.081
so all we need to do
is go see her--

19:04.211 --> 19:05.651
you, and switch
the bags back.

19:05.712 --> 19:10.452
Actually, I...
didn't go home.

19:10.517 --> 19:13.317
I kind of went to
Charlotte's birthday party.

19:13.386 --> 19:15.986
- You lied?
- Well, not completely.

19:16.055 --> 19:18.685
I didn't feel great.

19:18.758 --> 19:22.498
Look, she invited me,
and I didn't want to
tell you guys.

19:22.562 --> 19:24.702
Why would you go to
Charlotte's party?

19:24.764 --> 19:27.404
I liked her back then.
I thought you guys were
too hard on her,

19:27.467 --> 19:31.097
but after I went,
I realised you were
right all along.

19:31.238 --> 19:33.238
She is mean.

19:33.240 --> 19:35.010
I can't believe this.

19:35.074 --> 19:37.784
That's why you
didn't want to come back
to this Halloween.

19:37.844 --> 19:41.084
I'm so sorry.

19:41.147 --> 19:43.377
I never should have
lied to you guys.

19:43.450 --> 19:44.720
Well, we can't
deal with this now.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.754
We have to go to
Charlotte's party.

19:50.290 --> 19:53.330
* Wait for
an invitation to arrive *

19:56.263 --> 19:59.173
* It's a dead man's party *

19:59.266 --> 20:01.366
* Who could ask for more? *

20:01.434 --> 20:02.904
Darbie:
Look at this party.

20:02.969 --> 20:05.309
It really wasn't
that fun.

20:05.372 --> 20:06.912
Is that
a chocolate fountain?

20:06.973 --> 20:11.283
* Leave your body
and soul at the door *

20:12.144 --> 20:14.584
Not fun, huh?

20:14.647 --> 20:17.477
I know it looks like
I was having a good time,

20:17.550 --> 20:19.750
but I felt really guilty.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.619
Let's just find
your Halloween bag.

20:25.091 --> 20:26.861
Where is it?

20:26.926 --> 20:28.996
Oh, that's right,
I totally forgot.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.101
I misplaced my bag.

20:30.162 --> 20:31.402
You what?

20:31.464 --> 20:33.304
Well, I didn't remember
until now.

20:33.366 --> 20:34.726
It wasn't important
at the time.

20:34.801 --> 20:37.071
- Where'd you put it?
- I don't know.

20:37.136 --> 20:38.636
Okay,
retrace your steps.

20:38.705 --> 20:40.735
Let's see, um,
I played a few games,

20:40.807 --> 20:42.737
made a Sundae,
entered the dance contest,

20:42.809 --> 20:45.309
- then I--
- Sounds like you
were miserable.

20:45.378 --> 20:46.778
I also went into
the haunted house,

20:46.846 --> 20:48.846
but it was too scary,
so I ran out.

20:48.915 --> 20:51.275
You know how much
I hate scary things.

20:51.351 --> 20:52.751
Look,
that criminal has it.

20:52.819 --> 20:54.719
Kelly, you can't just
accuse him of st--

20:54.787 --> 20:56.457
No. He's a criminal.

20:56.523 --> 20:58.223
* Walking down the street *

20:58.291 --> 20:59.361
Oh.

20:59.426 --> 21:01.486
* I was hit by something *

21:01.561 --> 21:04.601
* Last night in my sleep *

21:04.664 --> 21:06.334
He went in the
haunted house.

21:06.399 --> 21:08.339
I am not going in there.

21:08.368 --> 21:09.638
I still have nightmares
about it.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.802
We don't have a choice.
Let's go.

21:11.871 --> 21:15.111
* Come and leave
your body at the door *

21:15.174 --> 21:20.354
* Leave your body
and soul at the door *

21:25.352 --> 21:26.792
Darbie: Whoa.

21:26.853 --> 21:29.193
Check out the
zombie birthday cake.

21:29.255 --> 21:30.715
I think these spiders
are real.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.990
- Stop!
- Ow! Hannah.

21:33.059 --> 21:34.029
None of it's real.

21:34.093 --> 21:36.163
Except for the spiders.

21:36.228 --> 21:38.398
And I'm pretty sure
that's a real coffin
over there.

21:38.465 --> 21:41.025
- Okay, I can't do this.
- Hannah, relax.

21:42.369 --> 21:43.699
Look. A piano.

21:43.770 --> 21:45.200
You love pianos.

21:45.271 --> 21:49.081
Not when it's being played by
a dead mummy with no hands.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.376
Look,
there's the criminal.

21:55.382 --> 21:57.422
What?! No,
don't leave me.

22:07.694 --> 22:09.064
What are you doing?

22:09.128 --> 22:10.458
That's my friend's
Halloween bag.

22:10.530 --> 22:11.760
No, it's not.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.001
- Prove it.
- Charlotte: Hey!

22:15.435 --> 22:16.565
What's going on?

22:16.636 --> 22:18.866
He stole my friend's
Halloween bag.

22:18.938 --> 22:20.138
No, I didn't.

22:20.206 --> 22:22.506
Look, it has my
initials inside.

22:22.575 --> 22:25.275
And my inhaler.

22:25.412 --> 22:28.922
- He proved it.
- Oops. Sorry.

22:28.981 --> 22:30.751
Um, great costume.

22:32.318 --> 22:35.018
Wait. Who are you?

22:35.087 --> 22:37.317
I know everybody
at my party.

22:37.424 --> 22:40.834
We were invited by
the DJ.

22:40.893 --> 22:42.063
Get out.

22:42.128 --> 22:43.298
Or I'll get security.

22:43.430 --> 22:45.770
Seriously?
Security?

22:50.670 --> 22:52.300
- We got kicked out.
- Come on.

22:52.439 --> 22:53.639
Wait.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.736
I think I know
where my bag is.

22:55.808 --> 22:57.878
Okay. Hurry.

23:03.282 --> 23:05.922
It's only fake.
It's only fake.

23:05.985 --> 23:08.245
It's only fake.

23:15.361 --> 23:18.471
You, uh, texting
your mom again?

23:18.465 --> 23:21.165
It's Kelly.
She's checking in on me.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.003
I told her
I didn't feel well.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.699
Mm.

23:24.771 --> 23:27.011
Why didn't you
invite them?

23:27.073 --> 23:30.083
I mean,
almost everyone else from
the basketball team is here.

23:30.142 --> 23:31.312
Why would I?

23:31.377 --> 23:33.307
I mean, Kelly's jealous
that I'm captain,

23:33.379 --> 23:34.779
and Darbie--

23:34.847 --> 23:37.877
Well, no offence,
but I just don't get her.

23:37.950 --> 23:41.690
Well, no offence,
but Kelly should be captain,

23:41.754 --> 23:44.864
and Darbie,
she's awesome.

23:44.924 --> 23:47.964
Look, I'm sorry,
but they're lame.

23:48.027 --> 23:51.127
You can be friends with
whoever you want, though.

23:51.197 --> 23:53.497
You're right. I can.

23:53.500 --> 23:57.040
I can't believe
I blew my friends off
for this party.

23:57.103 --> 23:58.973
Talk about lame.

24:21.594 --> 24:23.964
It's only fake.
It's only fake.

24:30.570 --> 24:32.240
- I got it.
- Yes.

24:33.673 --> 24:35.883
Turns out, I left it
in the haunted house.

24:40.547 --> 24:42.347
You're the best.

24:42.414 --> 24:43.954
I am?

24:44.016 --> 24:46.646
Thanks for
sticking up for us.

24:46.719 --> 24:48.149
Oh. You saw that.

24:49.455 --> 24:52.755
Hey, I'm sorry
I ditched you.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.925
You guys are the best.

24:54.994 --> 24:57.334
Maybe on the way back
we can trick-or-treat
a little more?

24:57.396 --> 24:58.356
Yeah.

24:58.430 --> 24:59.600
Yeah, totally.

25:01.233 --> 25:04.043
I don't know about you,
but I can't wait
for this night to end.

25:04.103 --> 25:06.613
Promise me next time
we go back to see
the dinosaurs.

25:06.673 --> 25:08.843
Deal. After that
haunted house,

25:08.908 --> 25:11.778
dinosaurs don't seem
that scary.

25:13.580 --> 25:15.620
Okay, and half
to get back.

25:23.389 --> 25:24.489
Did it work?

25:24.591 --> 25:26.961
Everything
looks the same.

25:27.026 --> 25:30.226
Ooh,
leftover Halloween candy
from last year.

25:30.296 --> 25:32.726
Yes, it's leftover.

25:32.799 --> 25:35.599
Because it's summer.
Right?

25:35.635 --> 25:39.435
- You okay?
- Yeah, fine, just
too much sugar.

25:39.505 --> 25:41.765
- You want a piece?
- No, thanks.

25:41.841 --> 25:43.011
Maybe just one.

25:47.246 --> 25:48.206
We did it.

25:50.817 --> 25:52.687
Now we can find Chuck.

25:52.752 --> 25:55.762
Wherever he is...

25:55.822 --> 25:57.022
he can't hide.
