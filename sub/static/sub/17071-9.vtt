all of your questions.

Can I please
just have my citizenship?

00:13.681 --> 00:15.716
I'm sorry it's taking
so much time, ma'am.

of our lives be so sentimental?

Getting my citizenship, moving
to Orlando, Eddie's first word.

01:30.691 --> 01:32.326
Which was "thug life,"
by the way.

01:32.360 --> 01:35.396
I'm gonna need you to confirm
that if anyone from school asks.

01:35.429 --> 01:36.630
I still don't understand

01:36.664 --> 01:38.899
how Mom is not a citizen
if I'm a citizen.

01:38.932 --> 01:39.933
Because you boys
were born here.

01:39.967 --> 01:41.335
And I'm a citizen because

01:41.369 --> 01:44.071
I applied for the green card
lottery and then I naturalized.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.773
And after that,
I sponsored Grandma,

01:45.806 --> 01:47.775
who also then naturalized
to become a citizen.

01:47.808 --> 01:50.278
And now she gets to stay here
forever.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.750
But your mom is a permanent
resident with a green card.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.118
Remember when we got
your green card?

01:58.152 --> 02:00.354
How they took us
into separate gray rooms

02:00.388 --> 02:02.022
and grilled us
about how we met.

of how you guys met again.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.604
reached out
its food-poisoned tentacles

02:16.637 --> 02:17.805
and pulled us together.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.440
It was love at first sight.

02:19.473 --> 02:20.474
For you, maybe.

I was busy being sick
from the waist down.

and a lengthy courtship,

my proposal.

Yes.

was a little teary.

was pinching my finger.

by storm.

to have me?

everything?

You're destroying my property!

19:14.921 --> 19:18.691
Oh, please, it's just
a piece of an old canoe.

19:18.725 --> 19:22.795
You wrote my number
on a restaurant canoe so
you wouldn't forget it?

19:22.829 --> 19:25.332
You loved me
at first sight!

19:25.365 --> 19:26.666
[ Sighs ]
I'm so embarrassed.

19:26.699 --> 19:29.035
All these years, you were acting
like you weren't a romantic,

19:29.068 --> 19:31.871
yet really, you fell in love
with me at first sight.

19:31.904 --> 19:33.240
Louis, stop saying it!

19:33.273 --> 19:35.375
But wait, if you knew you wanted
to marry me

19:35.408 --> 19:36.909
from
the first moment we met,

19:36.943 --> 19:39.712
why did you say no all those
other times I proposed to you?

19:39.746 --> 19:43.250
Because I wanted to enter
the marriage on equal footing.

19:43.283 --> 19:45.352
Get my Visa situation
sorted out first

19:45.385 --> 19:46.819
so that when I did say yes,

19:46.853 --> 19:49.322
you wouldn't think
that I was just marrying you

19:49.356 --> 19:51.491
for a green card.

19:51.524 --> 19:54.060
When I got denied that day,
I didn't have a choice.

19:54.093 --> 19:55.262
It was either marry you

19:55.295 --> 19:58.831
or get deported
and never see you again.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.567
I wasn't gonna do that.

20:03.903 --> 20:08.007
This right here --
this is why I do the job.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.009
Well,
I have everything I need.

20:10.042 --> 20:14.347
Jessica Huang, your application
for naturalization is approved.

20:14.381 --> 20:15.848
Congratulations, you two.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.950
Oh, thank you!
[ Laughs ]

20:23.122 --> 20:24.391
Oh, let me help.

20:24.424 --> 20:27.860
Baby, let's go fill up the
Accord with cheap, cheap gas.

20:27.894 --> 20:30.330
Louis.
[ Chuckles ]

20:36.603 --> 20:40.307
They gave me a pocket copy
of the Constitution.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.474
Swear on it.

20:41.508 --> 20:43.976
Swear that you will never
tell the boys my secret.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.812
That you have
a criminal record?

20:45.845 --> 20:49.449
Yes, and also that I...
you know...

20:49.482 --> 20:50.717
Fell in love with me
at first sight?

20:50.750 --> 20:51.984
Yes.

20:52.018 --> 20:54.354
And also the teacher thing.
Especially the teacher thing.

20:56.423 --> 20:59.225
Okay, everyone,
we're ready to begin.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.928
Together:
I hereby declare on oath

21:01.961 --> 21:04.897
that I will support and defend
the Constitution

21:04.931 --> 21:07.567
and laws
of the United States of America

21:07.600 --> 21:10.970
against all enemies
foreign and domestic.

21:11.003 --> 21:15.308
That I will bear true faith
and allegiance to the same.

21:15.342 --> 21:20.112
And that I take this obligation
freely, so help me God.

21:20.146 --> 21:22.815
Welcome, all of you
new American citizens.

21:22.849 --> 21:26.386
[ Cheers and applause ]
