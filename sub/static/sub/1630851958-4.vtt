WEBVTT

00:11.094 --> 00:14.639
GRAND OPENING!

00:14.723 --> 00:16.182
My love…

00:16.683 --> 00:17.726
Casimiro!

00:18.226 --> 00:20.437
I'm recording you, my queen.

00:21.104 --> 00:23.940
We don't have tortillas.
We can't open without tortillas!

00:24.024 --> 00:26.735
What? We came to this country,
and now we're gringos?

00:27.235 --> 00:30.030
- Love, don't get angry.
-This salsa is bland.

00:30.113 --> 00:33.700
We can't open like this.
Don't stick your hand in there!

00:34.242 --> 00:36.995
Wow! This salsa is perfect,

00:37.078 --> 00:39.330
and you look gorgeous, my queen.

00:39.414 --> 00:43.293
We're opening the taco shop today,
and it's going to be a success.

00:43.376 --> 00:45.211
What if they don't like our food?

00:45.295 --> 00:48.840
Not like your food?! There's no way.

00:48.923 --> 00:53.303
The other shops in the hood
are about to go out of business.

00:53.386 --> 00:54.971
Stop, Casimiro.

00:56.431 --> 00:57.849
Where's my necklace?

00:59.017 --> 01:01.978
I had it on in the morning.
Have you seen it, mija?

01:03.146 --> 01:05.315
Casimiro, I need my necklace.

01:05.398 --> 01:07.525
I don't know,
but it's time to open, mamita.

01:07.609 --> 01:10.236
No. This is not a good sign.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.655
It's not a good sign
to not open the door.

01:12.739 --> 01:14.949
Then why are you standing around? Go!

01:15.033 --> 01:17.285
My love, now you record me.

01:17.368 --> 01:18.578
Give it to me.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.831
-Turn it over.
- It's my turn to be the star.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.833
-I want to look good.
-

01:24.751 --> 01:25.752
Get it!

01:25.835 --> 01:28.755
-Come on in!
-You just opened?

01:28.838 --> 01:30.256
-Yes.
-Uh…

01:30.340 --> 01:32.258
-Welcome.
-Thank you very much.

01:34.260 --> 01:35.804
Can I start a tab?

03:45.225 --> 03:47.977
- I'm not the father?
-His petition won't be approved.

04:15.672 --> 04:17.131
-Can you?
- Stop fighting!

04:17.215 --> 04:18.967
Everything is falling apart for me.

04:19.050 --> 04:20.343
Casimiro, don't worry.

04:27.267 --> 04:31.187
So what?
All us ranchers have bastard sons?

04:31.271 --> 04:32.397
-Screw that!
- Wait.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.866
How should I know?
I was there.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.661
I practically pulled him out
with my own hands.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.295
- Easy-peasy.
- "Easy-peasy."

04:57.547 --> 04:58.715
Four months!

05:18.943 --> 05:21.487
- I'm not gonna leave you.
-Everything's all right.

05:37.545 --> 05:39.213
- Come.
-Be strong, my love.

05:39.297 --> 05:40.298
Come, look.

05:54.228 --> 05:55.772
Thanks for your support.

05:56.439 --> 05:57.273
Always.

06:04.113 --> 06:05.698
Come by the taqueria.

06:06.532 --> 06:08.034
I have something for you.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.081
Excuse me.

07:33.786 --> 07:35.204
What do you think?

07:36.289 --> 07:37.373
Shall we get married?

07:38.166 --> 07:40.793
- I'm just playing.
- Yes.

07:40.877 --> 07:44.589
-Would you want to get married again?
-You heard what the lawyer said.

07:44.672 --> 07:45.923
It couldn't hurt.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.759
Not for papers.

07:48.843 --> 07:49.760
For love.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.058
Just so you know,

07:56.142 --> 07:58.102
I do love you, Casimiro.

08:12.283 --> 08:16.162
It's okay.
Don't say it if you're not ready.

08:26.422 --> 08:30.009
I want to say the words
you want to hear, but I can't.

08:30.092 --> 08:31.219
I'm sorry, Lupita.

08:31.302 --> 08:33.429
I know it's stupid, but…

08:33.513 --> 08:36.724
I need to know
Delfina gives us her blessing.

08:39.936 --> 08:44.148
- Right?
-Oh, look at you two. Swingers!

08:46.442 --> 08:48.903
No, no, no.
What do you mean, swingers?

08:50.947 --> 08:53.533
She's an angel.
We're no damn swingers.

08:55.952 --> 08:59.997
It's not stupid, Casimiro.
I believe in signs too.

09:09.173 --> 09:11.759
Ana!
Why are you making so much noise?

09:11.842 --> 09:12.843
Damn you!

09:58.180 --> 10:01.267
Erik, stop that shit.
You're calling me a cuckold.

10:01.350 --> 10:03.894
Eh? What are you calling your grandmother?

10:05.396 --> 10:06.772
Doesn't Lidia need you?

10:17.825 --> 10:20.578
Why don't you go back to your baby? Hm?

10:21.203 --> 10:22.622
What are you doing here?

11:43.494 --> 11:44.662
What's wrong?

11:44.745 --> 11:47.164
-Ah, it's nothing Pop.
- Are you sad?

11:50.793 --> 11:53.003
This should be
an exciting time in your life.

11:53.629 --> 11:55.631
New friends, new experiences.

12:12.440 --> 12:15.735
I understand that,
but you've got to be strong.

12:16.902 --> 12:20.990
Hm? To protect your daughter
from this crazy world.

12:32.918 --> 12:34.962
It's because you're from Boyle Heights…

14:05.803 --> 14:07.638
I hope this works, Lupita.

14:07.721 --> 14:09.473
Oh yes, love.

14:17.022 --> 14:19.567
Delfina's been sending mixed messages.

14:20.234 --> 14:24.154
When I went shopping,
a hummingbird followed me home.

14:24.238 --> 14:25.489
-Seriously?
-Mm.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.075
But I also saw a dead rat.

14:28.158 --> 14:29.076
Well…

14:29.910 --> 14:32.246
let's ask her.

15:01.025 --> 15:02.359
Delfina.

15:04.028 --> 15:09.325
If you are here,
know that this space

15:09.950 --> 15:12.369
is filled with love.

15:17.249 --> 15:19.460
You look very pretty, Lupe.

15:23.380 --> 15:24.965
Is she angry or happy?

15:25.049 --> 15:26.216
My love.

15:29.178 --> 15:31.722
I don't want to upset you,

15:32.389 --> 15:34.058
but what do you want?

15:37.895 --> 15:39.688
Was Delfina the jealous type?

24:40.270 --> 24:42.314
Thanks for coming, mija.

24:42.397 --> 24:45.650
Look at what I found under some boxes.

24:46.610 --> 24:48.570
-Huh? Remember?
- Of course.

24:56.661 --> 25:00.040
Maybe we didn't always show it,

25:00.123 --> 25:01.917
but we love you a lot.

26:24.082 --> 26:26.626
We didn't get to go out on our terms.

26:26.710 --> 26:30.046
Closing Mama Fina's
doesn't mean we failed.

26:32.007 --> 26:35.427
Family and love aren't found
in a building. They're found in here.

26:36.219 --> 26:37.762
No one can take that away.

27:15.508 --> 27:17.886
You need to go back to your family.

27:27.646 --> 27:28.605
And you?

27:29.481 --> 27:31.232
You need to marry Lupe.

27:32.609 --> 27:33.693
You love her too.

28:27.038 --> 28:29.999
Every day, I wake up with such joy.

28:33.753 --> 28:35.130
Thank you, my love.

28:39.092 --> 28:40.593
With so much…

28:43.513 --> 28:44.973
inexplicable happiness…

28:47.183 --> 28:48.309
because of you.

28:54.983 --> 28:56.651
CONGRATULATIONS

29:08.788 --> 29:10.331
I love you, Lupita.

29:19.466 --> 29:21.509
I love you too, Casimiro.
