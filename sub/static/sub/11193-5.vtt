WEBVTT

00:27.000 --> 00:29.039
What's in the fancy box?

00:29.079 --> 00:33.456
<i>It is naqahdah. Raw naqahdah
is highly valued by the Goa'uld.</i>

00:33.398 --> 00:36.731
<i>SG-3 brought a little
of the element back last year.</i>

00:36.716 --> 00:38.756
We could really use some, sir.

00:40.636 --> 00:43.008
<i>Well, maybe there's more.</i>

00:48.673 --> 00:50.084
Whoa!

01:07.108 --> 01:08.436
Look.

01:17.385 --> 01:20.173
<i>I wish he'd stop doing that.</i>

01:55.453 --> 01:57.825
She's gonna jump.

01:59.252 --> 02:01.209
Daniel!

02:12.769 --> 02:13.967
Agh!

02:17.966 --> 02:19.591
No, wait... Please.

02:26.084 --> 02:28.123
Stay away from the princess.

02:32.401 --> 02:34.442
It's OK.

02:35.081 --> 02:37.121
Colonel!

02:38.320 --> 02:41.274
Tell them to lower their weapons.

02:42.679 --> 02:44.587
<i>They will kill him!</i>

03:56.575 --> 03:58.402
What were you thinking?

03:58.456 --> 04:00.247
I thought she'd be grateful.

04:00.295 --> 04:02.288
She was trying to kill herself.

04:02.335 --> 04:03.366
On your knees!

04:04.413 --> 04:08.246
No, actually I've got this cartilage
problem, little ACL thing...

04:08.213 --> 04:10.787
Agh! Yeah, that helps.

04:12.092 --> 04:18.093
My father, Pyrus the God-slayer and ruler
of this planet, wants to know who you are.

04:17.971 --> 04:21.089
We're explorers. Peaceful explorers.

04:22.649 --> 04:24.687
You attacked my daughter.

04:24.728 --> 04:26.353
No!

04:26.408 --> 04:27.949
Tell him.

04:38.165 --> 04:40.204
Only one of you is Jaffa.

04:47.481 --> 04:49.473
Who sent you?

04:50.521 --> 04:52.560
Where are you from?

04:53.358 --> 04:57.569
We're from a planet... called Earth.

05:01.398 --> 05:03.555
What Goa'uld rules there?

05:04.716 --> 05:07.254
- None.
- Liar.

05:07.276 --> 05:09.434
Thieves.

05:09.475 --> 05:12.345
You will tell me the truth or you will die.

05:14.434 --> 05:16.225
- Put them in the mine!
- Father!

05:18.951 --> 05:21.620
No, wait! We're not thieves.

05:23.151 --> 05:24.978
Wait!

05:25.029 --> 05:26.903
Please!

05:44.144 --> 05:47.228
Colonel, he isn't a Goa'uld.

05:47.744 --> 05:50.317
I don't think these are real Jaffa either.

05:50.343 --> 05:53.177
- How do you know?
- The first clue was his voice.

05:54.461 --> 05:56.500
Yeah, I noticed that, too.

05:56.540 --> 06:00.372
Sir, I can't really explain it,
but when he grabbed me I just knew.

06:00.339 --> 06:04.716
I felt it... or to be more accurate,
I didn't feel it.

06:05.538 --> 06:09.120
Sir, it may have something to do with
the Goa'uld that invaded me.

06:09.096 --> 06:12.014
Lately I get this weird feeling
when I'm near Teal'c.

06:12.016 --> 06:13.261
Hey, who doesn't?

06:13.336 --> 06:16.290
I... I can sense the presence
of a Goa'uld now.

06:16.295 --> 06:19.129
I didn't get that feeling
when he grabbed me.

06:19.134 --> 06:23.345
I agree with Captain Carter.
The ruler here is not a Goa'uld.

06:23.292 --> 06:27.668
All right, let's assume you're both right.
How does that help us?

06:27.610 --> 06:29.271
I'm not sure.

06:29.331 --> 06:32.949
Look, I'm really sorry, you guys.
This is totally my fault.

06:32.930 --> 06:36.048
You will meet your quota for the day,
or you will not eat.

06:36.048 --> 06:38.088
You know,...

06:38.129 --> 06:41.829
...I've seen an awful lot of
union violations around here.

06:41.807 --> 06:44.345
I should probably
speak to your supervisor.

06:49.365 --> 06:51.072
You will work!

06:54.363 --> 06:56.689
Hi-ho, hi-ho. Back to work.

07:09.278 --> 07:11.317
I can't move any more.

07:24.314 --> 07:26.353
Put down your tools.

07:35.430 --> 07:37.887
How does your leg feel now?

07:41.470 --> 07:43.793
Oh, much better, thanks.

07:43.827 --> 07:44.692
Argh!

07:51.625 --> 07:54.377
<i>- Let's go! Let's go!
- This way.</i>

07:57.465 --> 08:00.382
- Let's go, Daniel!
- I'm comin'!

08:08.382 --> 08:11.050
Daniel! God!

08:15.858 --> 08:18.230
- He's alive!
- Carter, Teal'c, take off.

08:18.259 --> 08:20.298
- Sir?
- Go!

08:31.095 --> 08:32.967
Foolish child.

08:38.773 --> 08:43.315
They must have been sent
by some distant, evil God.

08:43.250 --> 08:45.706
Then they are here to raid our mine,...

08:46.370 --> 08:48.908
...and we can spare none of our naqahdah.

08:48.927 --> 08:51.216
It grows more scarce by the day.

08:51.248 --> 08:52.741
I know.

08:52.807 --> 08:55.096
I will not put our world in jeopardy.

08:57.566 --> 09:01.812
When you are gone I will have to make
these kinds of choices all the time.

09:01.764 --> 09:04.967
Please... believe in me.

10:00.187 --> 10:02.225
Do you feel better?

10:05.706 --> 10:07.330
What's going on?

10:07.384 --> 10:10.836
You tried to escape.
You were badly wounded.

10:12.702 --> 10:15.075
- My friends?
- They were recaptured.

10:17.261 --> 10:19.302
By what name are you called?

10:19.341 --> 10:21.379
Daniel Jackson.

10:22.779 --> 10:26.113
May I help you out, Daniel Jackson?

10:33.657 --> 10:35.696
Thank you. Why am I wearing this?

10:35.736 --> 10:38.489
I took the liberty of providing royal robes.

10:38.495 --> 10:40.534
You may call me Shyla.

10:40.575 --> 10:44.359
In return for saving your life,
please do not try and escape again.

10:44.332 --> 10:46.373
I have taken responsibility for you.

10:47.373 --> 10:48.369
OK.

10:48.452 --> 10:52.153
It would also be rude of you
to try and hurt me in any way.

10:52.131 --> 10:56.508
You do realise it's also rude to kidnap
people and chain them up in a mine.

10:56.451 --> 11:01.740
Forgive me for not telling my father
what really happened by the cliff. I...

11:01.649 --> 11:03.855
He would not understand.

11:04.807 --> 11:06.217
OK.

11:06.288 --> 11:10.284
So you're not Goa'ulds,
but you're running a naqahdah mine...

11:10.285 --> 11:13.784
...and you've got yourselves...
a Goa'uld sarcophagus.

11:13.764 --> 11:15.804
You know of the sarcophagus?

11:15.845 --> 11:20.008
Yeah, I've used one before. A couple
of times too many, if you ask me.

11:19.962 --> 11:22.500
- Really?
- My... uh...

11:22.522 --> 11:25.095
Oh, you want your glass circles.

11:29.639 --> 11:31.965
I'm afraid they were broken.

11:42.716 --> 11:45.087
I just know I've done the right thing.

11:45.755 --> 11:46.751
Come.

11:47.674 --> 11:49.713
I must show you something.

11:53.513 --> 11:56.431
- He needed medical attention.
- I know.

11:56.432 --> 12:00.511
It wasn't your fault, sir. We had to
take the opportunity when we did.

12:00.471 --> 12:02.297
I know that, too.

12:11.427 --> 12:13.466
I've had worse.

12:20.105 --> 12:22.144
Isn't this splendid?

12:23.943 --> 12:25.982
Why are we here?

12:26.023 --> 12:29.392
I know you must have seen much
in your travels, but...

12:30.501 --> 12:35.293
...surely you've never seen anything
quite so beautiful.

12:35.220 --> 12:37.259
We call them trees.

12:37.700 --> 12:38.813
Oh!

12:38.899 --> 12:40.690
Um, so do we.

12:40.739 --> 12:42.861
Then you've seen them on other worlds?

12:42.898 --> 12:44.937
Yeah.

12:45.498 --> 12:48.167
Oh, I'm a fool, aren't I?

12:48.657 --> 12:52.605
Surely you've seen more incredible things
than I can even imagine.

12:52.575 --> 12:55.279
Please, tell me about them.

12:55.293 --> 13:00.168
Um, look... I-I'd really like to tell you
everything you wanna know, but, um...

13:01.812 --> 13:03.850
But my friends...

13:04.572 --> 13:07.904
My father believes you all have
a nefarious purpose here.

13:07.890 --> 13:09.349
But you don't.

13:11.609 --> 13:14.977
We will convince him
that you are decent, honest people...

13:14.967 --> 13:17.174
...who will bring no harm to our kingdom.

13:20.488 --> 13:24.437
Uh, well, I don't suppose
we could go talk to your father... now?

13:25.924 --> 13:27.963
He is not well now.

13:28.845 --> 13:33.386
I don't wanna spoil this little...
rapport we seem to have going here...

13:33.322 --> 13:35.565
That sounds almost romantic.

13:35.601 --> 13:37.595
Oh, boy... OK. Here's the thing.

13:37.642 --> 13:42.101
Um, I'm grateful you saved my life and
that you wanna help me free my friends,...

13:42.039 --> 13:45.039
...but I'm sensing you did it
because you're...

13:45.038 --> 13:47.162
Because you're my destiny.

13:47.999 --> 13:49.576
Wha... What?

13:51.677 --> 13:54.760
Before she died,
my mother and I used to come out here...

13:54.755 --> 13:56.796
...and take long walks at night.

13:58.794 --> 14:02.745
You can see every star in the sky
through the treetops.

14:02.712 --> 14:04.539
But about the destiny thing?

14:04.592 --> 14:07.594
She said a great man
would come from beyond the sun...

14:08.711 --> 14:10.750
...just for me.

14:11.630 --> 14:13.042
Oh.

14:17.028 --> 14:20.149
I had come to believe
my mother was wrong,...

14:21.548 --> 14:23.873
...that my true love would never come.

14:25.067 --> 14:29.360
I stood on that cliff
and I wished one last time.

14:32.585 --> 14:36.332
At just the right moment you were there
to save me, Daniel Jackson.

14:37.903 --> 14:39.942
You cannot deny that is fate!

14:41.741 --> 14:43.780
Oh, God...

14:49.179 --> 14:51.467
- Hi, guys.
- Daniel!

14:55.259 --> 14:57.298
Well, look!

14:57.777 --> 15:00.481
Surprisingly difficult to kill you, isn't it?

15:00.496 --> 15:03.366
<i>We are pleased to see you,
Daniel Jackson.</i>

15:03.375 --> 15:04.785
<i>What happened?</i>

15:07.774 --> 15:11.024
Uh, Sam was right. Pyrus isn't a Goa'uld.

15:11.373 --> 15:13.330
What's with the dress?

15:13.652 --> 15:15.692
Oh, um...

15:16.052 --> 15:18.091
They're royal robes.

15:18.610 --> 15:21.610
Uh, long story short,
they have a sarcophagus.

15:22.649 --> 15:26.018
The princess put me in it and saved me
because she has a crush on me.

15:27.408 --> 15:29.317
- A crush?
- Yeah.

15:29.368 --> 15:31.525
Actually, she thinks I'm her destiny.

15:31.567 --> 15:36.359
The whole... saving her life thing.
I guess she was grateful after all.

15:39.404 --> 15:41.445
Well, good job.

15:41.484 --> 15:45.611
How about gettin' the goons to unlock us
and get us the heck outta here?

15:45.562 --> 15:47.684
Uh, yeah. Not yet.

15:47.722 --> 15:49.798
I'm sorry?

15:51.241 --> 15:53.911
Well, it's... kind of a sensitive situation.

15:53.921 --> 15:57.086
Pyrus hasn't exactly agreed
to let you go yet,...

15:57.080 --> 16:00.283
...but I'm working on it.
I'm trying to gain his trust.

16:01.517 --> 16:03.557
Yeah, I know. This is really...

16:03.996 --> 16:05.408
Weird?

16:05.476 --> 16:09.142
I just wanted to let you know I was OK,
and I'll talk to Pyrus at dinner.

16:09.115 --> 16:11.154
You get dinner?

16:12.875 --> 16:16.788
Yeah. Um, some feast in my honour
or something.

16:16.753 --> 16:18.580
Feast!

16:19.072 --> 16:21.230
There's a feast, is there?

16:21.272 --> 16:23.311
Just trust me, OK?

16:24.951 --> 16:26.990
I just... I need more time.

16:33.948 --> 16:36.024
Glad you're OK!

16:51.462 --> 16:53.501
Um, just me?

17:09.057 --> 17:11.096
Um, hello. I'm Daniel Jackson.

17:11.136 --> 17:12.797
Hmph!

17:12.856 --> 17:17.151
My father is pleased you are honoured
to dine in the company of his greatness.

17:19.214 --> 17:21.172
Exactly.

17:21.213 --> 17:24.250
He may tell you the story
of how he became the God-slayer.

17:27.212 --> 17:29.750
I killed the Goa'uld who ruled here.

17:34.568 --> 17:36.608
And how long ago was that?

17:36.650 --> 17:38.689
700 years.

17:39.048 --> 17:41.086
700 years? But you're a...

17:43.847 --> 17:46.337
Well, of course, the sarcophagus, but...

17:46.366 --> 17:50.233
...I had no idea
it could sustain human life so long.

17:50.204 --> 17:52.576
- Does that mean that you're...?
- No.

17:52.605 --> 17:56.221
I am young by comparison.
I have not needed it to extend my life.

17:56.203 --> 17:59.951
So the people worship your father
because he's lived so long?

18:01.401 --> 18:04.817
They worship him because
he liberated them from the evil God.

18:04.799 --> 18:07.967
Um, then why does he still keep them
working in the mine?

18:07.960 --> 18:10.414
So the other distant,
evil gods won't come.

18:12.837 --> 18:14.580
So this is a masquerade.

18:14.637 --> 18:18.470
You send naqahdah through the Stargate
because the Goa'uld did that.

18:21.715 --> 18:25.547
No wonder you fear strangers.
You're afraid of being found out.

18:25.515 --> 18:27.554
I must sleep.

18:29.313 --> 18:31.353
Um, wait. Uh...

18:33.311 --> 18:35.351
Uh, about my friends...

18:38.109 --> 18:40.518
- Kill them.
- What?

18:40.549 --> 18:42.376
- No!
- Father,...

18:42.429 --> 18:46.971
...you said their punishment for trying to
escape would be to work in the mine...

18:46.907 --> 18:49.825
...without rest for as long as they live,...

18:49.826 --> 18:52.199
...as an example to the other workers.

18:53.786 --> 18:56.027
- I did?
- Yes.

19:10.500 --> 19:15.625
Do not worry about your friends. I have
instructed the guards to treat them well.

19:15.539 --> 19:17.615
I'm sorry. This is unacceptable.

19:17.659 --> 19:20.114
I can't be up here
while they're down there.

19:20.138 --> 19:22.178
We will change my father's mind.

19:23.576 --> 19:26.577
You're not understanding
what they mean to me.

19:26.576 --> 19:28.698
It just may take some time.

19:28.734 --> 19:30.773
Or maybe you do.

19:30.894 --> 19:34.761
The longer it takes to free them,
the more time we have together, right?

19:35.413 --> 19:38.201
I admit that is what I would like.

19:38.692 --> 19:40.731
Well, then release my friends.

19:41.490 --> 19:45.785
I won't leave. I'll stay
and get to know you better, I promise.

19:45.730 --> 19:47.604
Then you do feel as I do.

19:58.126 --> 20:00.367
- Should I not have done that?
- No, no.

20:00.405 --> 20:03.323
It's, uh, it's OK. It's just...

20:03.325 --> 20:05.897
Maybe you're still not fully recovered.

20:08.202 --> 20:11.239
Uh, you know,
I really don't think that's necessary.

20:11.242 --> 20:12.819
I mean, uh... I'm OK.

20:16.681 --> 20:18.923
But you'll feel so much better.

20:18.960 --> 20:20.868
It's, uh... Please.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.413
For me?

20:23.958 --> 20:26.530
You will feel better
than you have ever felt.

20:26.557 --> 20:28.515
Trust me...

20:28.557 --> 20:30.882
...and I will trust you.

20:30.916 --> 20:32.955
I promise.

21:11.384 --> 21:13.423
SG-1's remote code, sir.

21:13.463 --> 21:17.248
No travellers, but we are receiving
another radio transmission.

21:17.222 --> 21:18.883
Patch it through.

21:18.942 --> 21:21.018
<i>Mission status is the same.</i>

21:21.061 --> 21:24.015
<i>Need more time
to resolve situation diplomatically.</i>

21:24.020 --> 21:27.388
<i>Next transmission in 24 hours.
Daniel Jackson, out.</i>

21:44.453 --> 21:46.493
What the hell's goin' on?

21:46.534 --> 21:50.614
<i>- It's been days since we saw you.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!</i>

21:50.573 --> 21:52.612
Oh, I'm sorry! Um...

21:52.652 --> 21:56.103
Yeah, I'm still working on...
on getting you guys out.

21:57.050 --> 22:00.882
Oh, in the meantime,
I've discovered something incredible.

22:02.648 --> 22:05.934
You do know we're dying down here,
don't you?

22:05.928 --> 22:09.260
I've taken the opportunity
to research the sarcophagus.

22:09.247 --> 22:13.078
It's amazing what it does to you
if you use it when you're healthy!

22:14.605 --> 22:16.978
Well, is that such a good idea?

22:17.005 --> 22:20.088
Well, Shyla won't trust me
if I don't show that I trust her.

22:20.804 --> 22:21.798
<i>Oh...</i>

22:22.522 --> 22:26.471
Shyla, is it now?
First-name basis. Shyla!

22:26.442 --> 22:28.896
I've used it before
without side effects.

22:28.921 --> 22:30.627
And look!

22:30.681 --> 22:32.507
No glasses.

22:32.560 --> 22:34.682
That looks like a side effect to me.

22:36.958 --> 22:38.665
Daniel,...

22:38.718 --> 22:40.342
...get us out of here.

22:40.397 --> 22:44.727
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Yeah. Yeah.
I'm working on it. I just need time.

22:44.675 --> 22:48.886
Oh, I sent General Hammond a message,
so he won't order an all-out attack.

22:49.355 --> 22:52.888
If we do this right
we'll have access to all the naqahdah...

22:52.874 --> 22:55.031
<i>.. and the sarcophagus.</i>

22:55.074 --> 22:57.646
How many times have you used it?

22:57.672 --> 23:00.708
I don't know. Nine or... ten.
Oh, Sam...

23:00.711 --> 23:03.913
I mean, everything is... is so clear.

23:04.631 --> 23:06.919
I mean, I feel like I could do...

23:07.509 --> 23:09.252
...anything.

23:09.828 --> 23:12.699
<i>One thing! You only have to do one thing!</i>

23:13.708 --> 23:18.250
And if you can't handle that,
we're gonna break outta here without you.

23:20.425 --> 23:22.464
She wants me to marry her.

23:22.505 --> 23:23.786
What?!

23:30.301 --> 23:32.509
All right, look...

23:32.541 --> 23:35.412
No, you look, Jack!

23:39.619 --> 23:42.192
I have got everything under control, OK?

23:44.218 --> 23:46.970
God! You never show me any respect!

23:48.537 --> 23:51.406
Your way didn't work. Now I'm handling it.

23:53.695 --> 23:56.779
All you guys have to do is hang in there.

24:12.930 --> 24:14.970
How is he?

24:16.607 --> 24:20.355
The sarcophagus does not
make him better the way it used to.

24:21.768 --> 24:24.436
Soon it will be time
for me to become queen.

24:25.007 --> 24:27.046
Will that be so bad?

24:29.204 --> 24:31.660
You do not approve of my father's ways.

24:33.003 --> 24:37.749
I can help you mine the naqahdah and
we can fight the Goa'uld, if you trust me.

24:37.682 --> 24:40.433
Even after I used your friends
to keep you close?

24:40.682 --> 24:42.721
Oh, yeah.

24:43.119 --> 24:45.278
I don't think you meant any harm.

24:45.318 --> 24:48.901
And then you will stay,
even after they are free?

24:50.278 --> 24:52.686
I've never felt better anywhere in my life.

24:54.596 --> 24:59.637
I've always felt out of place on my planet.
I wanted to make a difference.

24:59.556 --> 25:02.472
There's still so much
you don't know about me.

25:08.512 --> 25:10.551
I know all I need to.

25:12.471 --> 25:15.093
We can change things here...

25:15.111 --> 25:16.736
...together.

25:25.268 --> 25:27.307
Water?

25:27.946 --> 25:29.489
Hey.

25:29.546 --> 25:31.585
We don't use the sarcophagus.

25:32.266 --> 25:34.305
What?

25:35.144 --> 25:36.769
Whoa!

25:36.824 --> 25:38.863
Boy, that was weird.

25:38.903 --> 25:43.814
I was having a vision or something.
I kept seeing the memory of Jolinar.

25:43.741 --> 25:47.573
The Resistance, the Tok'ra...
they don't use the sarcophagus.

25:48.181 --> 25:53.137
It... it does bad things to you. It changes
your mind, takes something from you.

25:54.378 --> 25:56.336
I kept hearing...

25:56.377 --> 25:59.047
Teal'c, what is... Kalach?

26:00.737 --> 26:02.776
It is Goa'uld.

26:03.695 --> 26:05.734
It means one's soul.

26:07.855 --> 26:10.309
Sir, we have to stop Daniel.

26:22.451 --> 26:24.608
The man who would be king.

26:24.650 --> 26:25.644
Agh!

26:26.809 --> 26:28.932
Hi, Jack!

26:31.367 --> 26:33.359
<i>Oh, it's Jack.</i>

26:33.688 --> 26:35.727
Hi, Jack.

26:39.205 --> 26:41.695
<i>Aagh...</i>

26:54.560 --> 26:57.478
We're losin' the battle down there,
you know.

26:59.719 --> 27:03.336
Carter's... started having, um,...

27:03.958 --> 27:07.539
...Goa'uld flashbacks.
Says if you keep using that...

27:08.277 --> 27:11.193
...sarcophagus,
you're gonna Dark Side on us.

27:12.836 --> 27:14.875
If you haven't already.

27:16.555 --> 27:20.006
Don't worry a bit.
We're getting out of here tomorrow.

27:21.673 --> 27:24.342
- What?
- I agreed to marry her.

27:24.352 --> 27:26.095
You did?

27:27.192 --> 27:29.230
But...

27:32.269 --> 27:35.685
...I said I had to go home
and straighten a few things out,...

27:35.669 --> 27:37.791
...and you guys are coming with me.

27:39.667 --> 27:41.708
She trusts you?

27:41.747 --> 27:43.786
She...

27:44.105 --> 27:46.144
...loves me.

27:49.065 --> 27:52.598
<i>- Love has blinded you.
- They are good people.</i>

27:52.583 --> 27:55.156
We have done a grave injustice to them.

27:55.182 --> 27:57.221
I pray that you are right.

27:57.262 --> 28:01.094
I must let Daniel go.
The choice to return must be his,...

28:02.299 --> 28:04.541
...but he will come back to me.

28:06.219 --> 28:08.887
He can't live without me any more.

28:40.728 --> 28:44.393
My father once was the greatest of men,...

28:44.367 --> 28:46.776
...but he can rule no longer.

28:46.807 --> 28:48.846
He lives only to see me married.

28:50.006 --> 28:53.873
I extend the sincerest of apologies
for the hardship done to you,...

28:54.684 --> 28:57.258
...and offer the friendship of our world.

28:58.442 --> 29:00.481
Well, thanks.

29:00.523 --> 29:04.935
Please know that from now on
you will always be welcome here...

29:05.321 --> 29:08.276
...and will be treated with
the utmost respect.

29:27.115 --> 29:28.942
I'll be back.

29:28.994 --> 29:30.192
Soon.

29:41.269 --> 29:43.309
We had a nice time, sir!

29:43.750 --> 29:48.042
Carter picked up some naqahdah,
Teal'c made some new friends, as usual.

29:47.989 --> 29:50.314
Daniel got engaged, and, uh...

29:52.307 --> 29:54.346
...I'm gonna hit the showers.

29:58.385 --> 30:00.009
This is stupid.

30:00.065 --> 30:02.981
Dr. Fraiser says
your systems are out of whack.

30:03.625 --> 30:05.663
Well, I feel fine.

30:07.182 --> 30:10.054
God, I need to get outta here.
I'm gonna go nuts.

30:20.219 --> 30:22.211
You're gonna wear a hole in the floor.

30:22.258 --> 30:24.795
I can't get her out of my head, Sam.

30:24.817 --> 30:26.940
I think I made a big mistake.

30:27.576 --> 30:29.949
- You're not serious?
- I am.

30:29.974 --> 30:31.801
<i>You have a wife.</i>

30:32.654 --> 30:35.063
Had. Had a wife.

30:35.094 --> 30:38.297
Come on, seriously.
How long am I supposed to wait?

30:39.373 --> 30:41.412
Even if I find Sha're one day,...

30:41.451 --> 30:44.903
...what are the chances
she's ever gonna be the same again?

30:46.531 --> 30:51.157
Your endorphin level was sky-high when
we came back. Now you're coming down.

30:51.089 --> 30:54.921
The effects of the sarcophagus
are like a narcotic, Daniel.

30:54.888 --> 30:58.221
Yeah. That makes you
smarter, stronger, feel great.

30:58.207 --> 31:00.246
What the hell is so wrong with it?

31:00.287 --> 31:04.035
I think it's partly what made
the Goa'uld as bad as they are.

31:04.006 --> 31:05.286
How?

31:05.365 --> 31:07.192
Who knows?

31:07.244 --> 31:09.569
It's Goa'uld technology, Daniel.

31:09.603 --> 31:12.936
Maybe its healing effects
alter your brain chemistry,...

31:12.923 --> 31:16.789
...increase adrenaline,
making you aggressive and irrationaI.

31:16.761 --> 31:19.218
Pyrus probably used to be a decent man.

31:21.320 --> 31:23.359
Look at yourself.

31:23.400 --> 31:25.522
It's like you need a fix.

31:25.558 --> 31:29.425
You only used it a few times
and already it's changed you.

31:29.398 --> 31:32.518
We can't just leave it there.
We have to study it.

31:33.116 --> 31:34.694
We can't go back either.

31:36.556 --> 31:38.713
I'm going.

31:39.595 --> 31:42.511
She used us to get you addicted.

31:49.352 --> 31:51.509
You've never really known what love is.

31:52.509 --> 31:55.795
See, the Daniel I know
would never have said that.

32:03.788 --> 32:06.824
- What are you saying, Captain?
- He needs to be confined.

32:06.826 --> 32:08.818
He's addicted to the effects...

32:08.865 --> 32:10.407
What's this?

32:10.465 --> 32:12.755
- It's my resignation.
- Oh, please!

32:12.785 --> 32:16.117
I request permission
to go through the gate to P3R-636.

32:16.103 --> 32:19.057
- Request denied!
- I wasn't asking you!

32:20.063 --> 32:22.601
- Daniel!
- Dr. Jackson?

32:23.061 --> 32:25.101
He's unconscious.

32:25.980 --> 32:29.930
This is General Hammond. Code Red
medical emergency in my office.

32:34.219 --> 32:38.298
I gave him a sedative.
His test results were all over the place.

32:38.257 --> 32:41.507
Liver function, kidneys,
endorphins, electrolytes...

32:41.496 --> 32:45.492
- There's muscle deterioration.
- Whatever. What's goin' on with him?

32:45.455 --> 32:49.155
I have no idea. The most I can do
is try and treat the symptoms,...

32:49.133 --> 32:52.964
...but he seems to be going through
some massive physical withdrawal.

32:52.932 --> 32:54.972
I have to go back!

32:56.491 --> 32:58.530
You're killing me!

32:59.371 --> 33:01.446
Stop killing me!

33:01.690 --> 33:03.315
Calm down!

33:04.088 --> 33:05.915
Argh...

33:08.367 --> 33:14.451
It's like all of his cells have lost the ability
to function properly and it's getting worse.

33:14.326 --> 33:17.492
- There's nothing you can do?
- I need time.

33:17.484 --> 33:19.727
The sarcophagus will keep him alive.

33:19.765 --> 33:24.058
We can't let him go back. That thing will
screw him up and we'll lose him anyway.

33:24.442 --> 33:27.016
The memories that
Jolinar left in my mind...

33:27.041 --> 33:30.576
...told me the sarcophagus
will take away everything he is.

33:30.560 --> 33:32.802
- What choice do we have?
- We wait it out.

33:34.681 --> 33:36.720
Just... a little longer.

33:56.513 --> 33:58.552
- Hey.
- How's he doin'?

33:59.032 --> 34:02.567
Well, I can't say for sure,
but I think maybe the worst is over.

34:02.551 --> 34:04.590
His blood work's encouraging.

34:04.632 --> 34:08.463
Body temperature's coming down,
pulse is normal, BP 120 over 80.

34:08.429 --> 34:10.469
So we made the right call.

34:11.230 --> 34:14.847
His cellular function
is starting to take back control.

34:14.827 --> 34:16.820
The next few hours should tell.

34:16.867 --> 34:19.358
It's time for another dose of sedative.

34:36.340 --> 34:38.380
OK, Daniel...

34:42.300 --> 34:44.090
Ohh!

34:45.739 --> 34:47.280
Stand down!

35:05.652 --> 35:07.525
I'm OK. Go.

35:39.242 --> 35:41.115
Jesus! Dammit!

35:42.161 --> 35:43.786
Daniel!

35:45.920 --> 35:47.960
Are you trying to kill me?

35:48.000 --> 35:49.956
You're trying to kill me.

35:53.518 --> 35:55.974
There'll be guards here in 30 seconds.

35:56.518 --> 35:58.556
I'm going back.

35:58.596 --> 36:02.759
You don't have to.
Fraiser says you're getting better.

36:02.715 --> 36:05.550
- You're lying!
- Why would I do that?

36:25.987 --> 36:27.815
Daniel! God...

36:33.425 --> 36:35.465
What are you gonna do, Daniel?

36:35.505 --> 36:37.545
You wanna kill me?

36:40.864 --> 36:42.523
Oh, God, look at you.

36:45.342 --> 36:47.380
I know what this is.

36:47.422 --> 36:49.545
I know what it's like.

36:51.780 --> 36:53.487
You can get through it.

36:58.978 --> 37:00.603
No...

37:28.969 --> 37:34.010
The probe's data indicates P3H-826
is a viable next mission for SG-1, sir.

37:36.847 --> 37:38.885
I have another suggestion.

37:42.204 --> 37:45.454
I think we should go back to P3R-636.

37:45.963 --> 37:48.880
But before you say anything,
just hear me out.

37:50.202 --> 37:54.532
There are thousands of innocent humans
there who we could free from slavery.

37:54.481 --> 37:57.317
Shyla cannot free her people
without great risk.

37:57.320 --> 37:59.893
Well, we have to offer her alternatives.

38:00.480 --> 38:02.518
New ways to mine the naqahdah.

38:02.559 --> 38:04.967
The Goa'uld may not notice
if shipments stop.

38:04.998 --> 38:09.458
Preliminary tests indicate countless
military and scientific applications...

38:09.396 --> 38:11.519
...for the raw ore.

38:11.556 --> 38:13.465
Might be a good reason to try, sir.

38:13.516 --> 38:17.014
Try what? The last time,
you were enslaved in that mine.

38:16.994 --> 38:21.371
Look, you want access to the mine,
but you don't wanna send troops in.

38:21.313 --> 38:24.599
I'm offering you a shot
at a diplomatic solution.

38:24.592 --> 38:26.418
Please, Jack.

38:27.672 --> 38:29.914
I need to take the chance.

38:36.548 --> 38:38.588
We can back him up, sir.

38:40.628 --> 38:42.751
I'd like Daniel back on the team.

39:04.579 --> 39:07.070
I did not believe you would ever return.

39:09.898 --> 39:12.983
I'm sorry... about your father.

39:15.018 --> 39:17.056
About everything.

39:21.335 --> 39:24.170
The sarcophagus
could not help him any more.

39:32.851 --> 39:34.891
You never did love me, did you?

39:36.170 --> 39:38.376
I wouldn't be here if I didn't care.

39:39.809 --> 39:43.012
I don't deserve to live
after what I've done to you.

39:43.409 --> 39:45.235
Yes, you do.

39:47.847 --> 39:49.887
Your people need you.

39:51.726 --> 39:56.802
You may still be able to lead them without
turning into what your father became.

39:57.005 --> 39:59.045
How?

40:03.163 --> 40:05.202
You can't use this any more.

40:07.001 --> 40:09.041
It's gonna be bad,...

40:09.081 --> 40:10.824
...trust me.

40:12.000 --> 40:14.954
But you don't have to do this alone.
