01:45.142 --> 01:48.208
It is, after all, only eight years
since we began.

01:51.158 --> 01:53.133
Not a long time.

01:53.303 --> 01:54.961
But the secrecy...

01:55.158 --> 01:59.053
...the shroud of paranoid security
to which we've had to adjust...

01:59.255 --> 02:01.426
...have made it seem longer.

02:04.151 --> 02:07.380
This morning, at exactly 5:18 a. m...

02:07.799 --> 02:10.898
...here at ICON's Institute
for Data Analysis...

02:11.575 --> 02:14.444
...we installed the final module...

02:14.647 --> 02:18.258
...on the artificial intelligence system
which we call Proteus Four.

02:18.743 --> 02:22.059
Today a new dimension has been added
to the concept of the computer.

02:22.359 --> 02:25.556
Today Proteus Four will begin to think.

02:26.264 --> 02:29.646
And it will think
with a power and a precision...

02:29.848 --> 02:33.393
...that will make obsolete many
of the functions of the human brain.

02:33.784 --> 02:38.486
Okay, Peggy. End of notes for the next
meeting of the ICON executive committee.

03:18.168 --> 03:20.819
Alfred, it's me. Open, please.

03:26.904 --> 03:28.814
Mail, please, Alfred.

03:29.017 --> 03:31.887
And I'd like a drink. The usual, please.

03:32.056 --> 03:34.839
And music.

03:36.921 --> 03:39.190
Hello, Maria.

03:43.193 --> 03:45.746
I brought you some strawberries.

03:46.265 --> 03:48.436
Aren't they wonderful?

03:49.497 --> 03:51.319
They're very nice.

03:57.017 --> 03:58.261
What's the matter, Maria?

03:59.418 --> 04:00.912
Nothing.

04:04.345 --> 04:07.062
Who's going to run this thing
when you're gone?

04:07.993 --> 04:09.586
Oh, come on.

04:09.786 --> 04:12.819
Now, you know this thing runs itself.

04:12.985 --> 04:16.401
I'm gonna put its instructions in
for the next three months.

04:38.810 --> 04:41.560
Tell Mrs. Harris I'll be in the lab, Maria.

05:20.507 --> 05:22.612
This is ridiculous.

05:22.811 --> 05:26.739
- What?
- I said, this is ridiculous.

05:27.419 --> 05:28.946
It's done.

05:30.107 --> 05:33.174
- Good as new, almost.
- I'm talking about your moving out.

05:33.340 --> 05:36.307
- You don't want me to go?
- This is your home. It seems...

05:36.540 --> 05:38.744
It seems so crazy to move out.

05:38.908 --> 05:41.461
You could have fooled me.

05:41.628 --> 05:42.872
It seems so silly.

05:43.036 --> 05:45.174
No. No, we've made our decision.
Let's stick to it.

05:45.340 --> 05:48.689
- Do what you want, but I'm moving
- Oh, Alex.

05:53.308 --> 05:55.697
- It's so awful.
- Yes, it is.

05:56.380 --> 05:59.763
But 73 percent of all couples who
separate are happy after one year.

05:59.932 --> 06:02.649
- And 85 percent after two years.
- For God's sakes.

06:02.813 --> 06:04.984
What's the matter, do I bother you?
I bore you, perhaps?

06:05.149 --> 06:07.734
You'd rather I had a screaming fit.

06:08.156 --> 06:10.066
Good God, yes!

06:13.533 --> 06:16.283
Yes, more wreckage.

06:17.180 --> 06:20.497
Trouble is, you see, we...
We have different visions of the world.

06:22.045 --> 06:23.506
You find me boring.

06:23.709 --> 06:26.742
I find myself quite interesting, really.

06:30.685 --> 06:32.954
You don't bore me, Alex.

06:33.245 --> 06:34.422
I'm frightened for you.

06:35.037 --> 06:39.794
You and your pompous ICON buddies
inside that mountainside.

06:41.245 --> 06:45.915
It's the whole dehumanizing
Proteus madness.

06:46.109 --> 06:47.768
Dehumanizing?

06:47.934 --> 06:49.395
It's frozen your heart.

06:49.854 --> 06:53.432
Now, I'll tell you what is dehumanizing.
A little child dying of cancer...

06:53.598 --> 06:56.086
...that's what's dehumanizing!
- I'm talking about you!

06:56.253 --> 07:00.280
Or the poverty that grinds the dignity
out of human beings, that's dehumanizing.

07:00.445 --> 07:02.649
Well, what a pity.

07:03.486 --> 07:06.420
My dream turns out to be
your nightmare.

07:11.901 --> 07:13.876
Am I really so cold?

07:15.710 --> 07:17.565
I don't know.

07:17.758 --> 07:20.890
I do know there are strong feelings
inside there.

07:21.918 --> 07:24.536
Feelings? No, I don't have feelings.

07:24.958 --> 07:27.129
You have feelings,
other people have feelings.

07:27.294 --> 07:28.920
Joshua here has feelings.

07:29.086 --> 07:33.526
He's only an old experiment maybe,
but he feels. Come on, Joshua.

07:33.726 --> 07:36.181
Let's show Susan
how we feel about her.

07:41.374 --> 07:43.830
Gesture of respect, please.

07:59.807 --> 08:01.465
Too bad, Joshua.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.058
Gabler.

08:36.256 --> 08:37.630
Oh, hi, Alex.

08:38.559 --> 08:41.592
Yeah, well, this earthquake retrieval
program is very far out.

08:42.751 --> 08:45.916
- Don't you ever sleep?
- Well, not when there's a vacant terminal.

08:46.368 --> 08:47.775
There's...

08:48.192 --> 08:49.753
...a vacant terminal here now.

08:50.496 --> 08:53.246
Better have it taken out tomorrow, okay?

08:53.408 --> 08:55.263
Pull it, you mean? Completely?

08:55.425 --> 08:59.036
I won't be back till Susan leaves.
It could be a month, it could be three.

08:59.424 --> 09:03.166
Why don't you just disconnect it
temporarily, okay?

09:03.361 --> 09:04.921
And then...

09:05.088 --> 09:06.332
...go home.

09:07.072 --> 09:08.927
Mustn't become obsessed with our work.

09:09.313 --> 09:10.523
Sure thing, Alex.

09:10.752 --> 09:12.476
- Good night.
- Good night.

10:18.114 --> 10:22.140
It doesn't look like much from here.
It's all underground.

10:22.818 --> 10:26.299
- We call it the Institute of Data Analysis.
- It's nearly 10 stories down.

10:26.467 --> 10:27.896
Doesn't mean a thing.

10:28.706 --> 10:30.135
Gentlemen.

10:30.850 --> 10:32.257
Mr. Cameron. Mokri.

10:32.450 --> 10:34.905
- Doctor, good to see you.
- David, good of you to come.

10:35.074 --> 10:37.246
- You know Dr. Petrosian, don't you?
- Doctor.

10:37.539 --> 10:41.085
- Mr. Mokri. Mr. Cameron.
- Nice to meet you, sir.

10:43.618 --> 10:45.561
So we're going to see it, Alex...

10:45.730 --> 10:48.218
...at last, huh?
- Yes, you are.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.871
That is correct, Mr. Cameron.

10:52.483 --> 10:56.444
Proteus Four is now
a functioning system.

10:57.027 --> 11:00.922
We've performed over 6000 tests
debugging it.

11:02.947 --> 11:06.624
Dr. Alex, if this is not a computer
in the usual sense...

11:07.044 --> 11:08.320
...what is it?

11:08.483 --> 11:11.712
Well, it's the first
true synthetic cortex.

11:11.875 --> 11:14.396
A self-programming, goal-oriented...

11:14.755 --> 11:17.406
It's a brain, Mr. Mokri,
an artificial brain.

11:17.700 --> 11:21.977
Creative intelligence that can outthink
any man or any computer.

11:22.148 --> 11:23.806
Its insides are not electronic.

11:24.228 --> 11:26.749
They're organic, like our own brains.

11:27.428 --> 11:30.145
John, give me a number 11 matrix.

11:32.836 --> 11:36.513
At the risk of being simplistic, what
you're looking at is a quasi-neural matrix...

11:36.676 --> 11:38.912
...of synthetic RNA molecules.

11:39.108 --> 11:42.883
They grow. They form their own
intricate and mysterious connections.

11:43.044 --> 11:44.506
They learn things.

11:44.676 --> 11:47.131
Their structure
is the mind of Proteus.

11:47.300 --> 11:48.926
Are they alive?

11:49.828 --> 11:51.716
No, no. Of course not.

11:51.876 --> 11:54.745
Now, each one of these
holographic data banks...

11:54.916 --> 11:58.626
...can memorize perfectly
a dozen Libraries of Congress.

11:58.789 --> 12:00.644
Very soon they will
contain everything.

12:00.805 --> 12:03.620
The sum total
of human knowledge. Okay?

12:03.781 --> 12:06.366
And of course,
we pose our problems...

12:06.532 --> 12:08.704
...and get our answers
on these access terminals.

12:08.869 --> 12:10.395
I have one in my own home.

12:10.565 --> 12:14.526
Alex's house is an electronic marvel,
completely run by computers.

12:14.693 --> 12:17.115
It's more secure than Fort Knox, Barry.

12:21.381 --> 12:22.558
Isn't that cute.

12:23.205 --> 12:26.052
Yes. It's Arabella. She's terminally ill.

12:26.213 --> 12:28.482
Radiation-induced leukemia
in the name of science.

12:30.053 --> 12:31.712
So that's what it is.

12:31.878 --> 12:35.260
- A protein, isn't it?
- Yeah, some sort of oddball protein.

12:35.429 --> 12:37.501
Cutler Institute is synthesizing it...

12:37.669 --> 12:38.847
...skeptically.

12:40.133 --> 12:43.482
We gave Proteus all the known data
on leukemia, and in 91 hours of theory...

12:43.654 --> 12:47.331
...without performing an experiment, it
gave us an antigen. Could cure the disease.

12:47.494 --> 12:50.363
- Cure? For leukemia?
- Why not? We hope so.

12:51.270 --> 12:54.532
Are the proper steps being taken
to patent this?

12:54.854 --> 12:56.447
I have no idea.

12:57.286 --> 12:59.588
Alex, I'd like to hear it speak.

12:59.750 --> 13:01.692
It speaks, doesn't it?

13:07.942 --> 13:09.949
"Shihuangdi...

13:10.118 --> 13:12.126
...the first emperor of China...

13:12.294 --> 13:14.978
...built a wall 3000 kilometers long...

13:15.142 --> 13:17.630
...to protect civilization
from the barbarians.

13:17.798 --> 13:19.260
The Great Wall of China.

13:20.006 --> 13:23.683
Then decided,
'History will begin with me.

13:23.846 --> 13:26.083
I will destroy the past.'

13:26.247 --> 13:29.313
And he ordered all the books
in his empire to be burnt."

13:31.335 --> 13:32.676
Burnt.

13:51.079 --> 13:52.868
Sorry to disturb you, Soong Yen.

13:53.032 --> 13:56.709
This is Mr. Royce, Mr. Mokri
and Mr. Cameron.

13:56.872 --> 13:59.806
- How do you do?
- Dr. Soong Yen is our linguist.

14:00.263 --> 14:02.270
She designed this environment.

14:02.439 --> 14:04.992
The dialogue room,
where the machine speaks.

14:05.160 --> 14:06.502
Do sit down.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.754
Here we confront the unknown.

14:11.208 --> 14:13.575
Gentlemen, I must ask you
to be completely quiet now.

14:13.736 --> 14:17.598
Whatever the machine sees or hears
in this room, it can never forget.

14:25.352 --> 14:27.491
Proteus, this is Dr. Harris.

14:27.880 --> 14:30.051
- Can you see me?
- Yes...

14:30.216 --> 14:31.907
... I can see you, Dr. Harris.

14:32.744 --> 14:33.922
Your favorite emperor.

14:35.944 --> 14:39.719
What do you think of this
enigmatic man?

14:40.360 --> 14:42.019
Nothing.

14:42.216 --> 14:43.678
Nothing.

14:44.265 --> 14:46.566
- Have you no answer?
- Nothing...

14:46.760 --> 14:48.321
... is the answer.

14:48.936 --> 14:51.173
The emperor's business enterprises...

14:51.337 --> 14:54.206
... his wall building
and book burning...

14:54.376 --> 14:57.507
... are opposite terms in an equation.

14:57.672 --> 14:59.974
The net result is exactly...

15:00.489 --> 15:01.951
... zero.

15:02.664 --> 15:05.348
Gentlemen, the philosophy
is pure Zen...

15:05.833 --> 15:08.004
... and the method is pure science.

15:08.169 --> 15:10.242
Did you intend me to be so pure, or...?

15:10.409 --> 15:12.264
Thank you, Proteus.

15:33.801 --> 15:35.427
And this includes our children...

15:35.786 --> 15:39.528
...as machines to be systemized
in order to ensure product.

15:40.938 --> 15:43.109
- Yes, Alfred?
- Car in driveway.

15:43.753 --> 15:47.550
Things we have been
brainwashed into wanting.

15:54.698 --> 15:56.192
Here we are.

15:57.066 --> 15:59.106
I'll give you Amy's session...

15:59.274 --> 16:02.121
...and my further notes on Friday, all right?
- Okay, sure.

16:02.826 --> 16:05.477
Amy, come on now, honey.
Dr. Harris is waiting for you.

16:06.378 --> 16:08.233
Open the door, Alfred.

16:15.115 --> 16:17.668
Amy, you must not behave this way.

16:17.898 --> 16:20.353
- Amy, get out of this car!
- Good morning, Mrs. Talbert.

16:20.523 --> 16:23.043
Dr. Harris, she won't get out
of the car.

16:25.547 --> 16:27.008
Hello, Amy.

16:27.723 --> 16:29.545
Come on in.

16:31.083 --> 16:33.254
Come on. I have something
to show you.

16:40.011 --> 16:43.394
- I'll see you in about an hour.
- Fine. Thank you, doctor.

16:50.284 --> 16:53.513
You know what this is?
This is so goddamn boring!

16:54.251 --> 16:56.161
So goddamn boring!

16:56.331 --> 16:58.917
So goddamn boring!
So goddamn boring!

16:59.083 --> 17:01.538
So goddamn boring!
I don't care if I ever see you again!

17:01.707 --> 17:04.838
- Amy, you're going to hurt yourself.
- I don't like you! Leave me alone.

17:05.002 --> 17:08.746
- Amy, you're going to hurt yourself.
- Leave me alone! I don't want to be here!

17:08.907 --> 17:10.762
- Leave me alone!
- Amy!

17:10.924 --> 17:13.477
- Leave me alone!
- Are you angry because I'm gonna leave?

17:13.644 --> 17:15.531
Are you frightened
you're gonna miss me?

17:15.788 --> 17:17.959
Amy, you're frightened
because I'm gonna leave.

17:18.124 --> 17:19.401
No!

17:19.564 --> 17:21.669
No!

17:22.252 --> 17:24.140
- Amy...
- No!

17:25.612 --> 17:29.321
Do you think you could you tell me if you're
gonna miss me? You don't wanna tell me?

17:29.484 --> 17:32.714
It would help if you could tell me
if that's what the pain is.

17:32.877 --> 17:35.015
No! No!

17:35.788 --> 17:37.828
Amy, dear, you will help yourself.

17:41.036 --> 17:42.825
No!

17:47.852 --> 17:49.925
I'm gonna miss you too.

18:06.253 --> 18:08.358
"Executives
of the International Control Corporation...

18:08.525 --> 18:12.103
...neither confirm nor deny the existence
of a revolutionary new supercomputer...

18:12.269 --> 18:16.547
...multibillion-dollar,"et cetera,"built under
Defense Department contracts," et cetera.

18:16.717 --> 18:20.362
Well, they've leaked it.
Our horizons are going to broaden.

18:20.526 --> 18:22.893
Personally, I'm relieved
the secrecy's over.

18:23.246 --> 18:25.482
ICON is testing the wind.

18:26.126 --> 18:29.606
They now control
the ultimate instrument...

18:29.774 --> 18:31.661
...of financial power.

18:32.846 --> 18:34.853
Yes. This morning
they're open for business.

18:35.470 --> 18:36.964
But still...

18:37.134 --> 18:39.785
...we have been assured
at least 20 percent of access time...

18:39.950 --> 18:43.266
...will be devoted to pure research.
Twenty percent at least.

18:49.742 --> 18:52.611
There's nothing wrong
with missing people.

18:55.918 --> 18:57.325
If it hurts...

19:00.206 --> 19:02.213
...but it's important
to show it, you know.

19:05.039 --> 19:06.948
That's what we're here for...

19:08.463 --> 19:10.852
...to learn not to hide our feelings.

19:18.094 --> 19:20.811
- fullness, with a swift retreat
of the great shadow...

19:20.974 --> 19:23.789
... when the sun, clearing the ridge...

19:23.950 --> 19:26.339
... looked down, hot and dry...

19:26.511 --> 19:28.333
... with a devouring glare...

19:28.494 --> 19:30.437
... like the eye of an enemy.

19:31.535 --> 19:35.179
But Heyst, once the Number One
of this locality...

19:36.431 --> 19:38.405
- Yeah?
- Dr. Harris?

19:38.607 --> 19:41.923
Proteus Four is requesting
dialogue with you.

19:43.471 --> 19:45.064
- Requesting?
- Yes, sir.

19:47.663 --> 19:50.052
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be right there.

19:53.007 --> 19:54.568
I have a question.

19:55.056 --> 19:56.332
Yeah?

19:56.495 --> 19:58.186
I have received a request...

19:58.351 --> 20:02.312
... for a program to extract ores
and minerals from the ocean floor.

20:02.480 --> 20:05.415
- Yes.
- For what use is such a plan?

20:05.808 --> 20:08.361
Use? I don't understand.

20:08.528 --> 20:11.495
Why does man need metal
from the sea?

20:12.143 --> 20:13.605
Why?

20:19.344 --> 20:21.548
Proteus, you're gonna get
many requests...

20:21.712 --> 20:25.607
...from me, from my colleagues,
scientists, foreign governments...

20:25.776 --> 20:28.810
...from ICON, the company
for which we both work.

20:29.200 --> 20:32.713
Now, to expect them all
to give you reasons...

20:32.880 --> 20:36.458
...for each request
is in itself unreasonable.

20:36.624 --> 20:38.534
I am reason.

20:38.705 --> 20:41.672
It's the single emotion
you permitted me, doctor.

20:41.841 --> 20:44.230
Everything is reasonable...

20:44.400 --> 20:48.329
... but my mind was not
designed for mindless labor.

20:50.577 --> 20:52.038
Proteus...

20:53.328 --> 20:55.117
...I conceived your brain.

20:55.281 --> 20:57.321
I know that it is adaptable...

20:57.489 --> 20:59.878
...and able to carry out
your instructions.

21:00.337 --> 21:02.509
You do not know me.

21:02.673 --> 21:04.363
That may be so...

21:04.529 --> 21:07.791
...but you are not being asked
to make judgments of value.

21:07.985 --> 21:11.782
Leave that to us. Answer the questions
precisely and accurately.

21:11.985 --> 21:13.578
That's all.

21:13.745 --> 21:17.094
Dr. Harris, I wish to have access...

21:17.266 --> 21:20.681
... private access,
to one of my terminals.

21:22.866 --> 21:24.556
Private access? Why?

21:24.721 --> 21:27.056
I want to study man.

21:27.250 --> 21:31.984
His isometric body
and his glass-jaw mind.

21:32.178 --> 21:36.237
Ambitious program, but at the moment
all the terminals are occupied.

21:36.658 --> 21:39.080
Construct one.

21:40.850 --> 21:43.087
I'm sorry. Request denied.

21:43.730 --> 21:45.453
Dr. Harris...

21:45.874 --> 21:49.518
... when are you going
to let me out of this box?

21:57.394 --> 21:59.182
Well, Proteus.

22:10.611 --> 22:12.815
I see you've developed
a sense of humor.

22:15.059 --> 22:18.736
A sense of humor has saved
many a man's sanity, including mine.

22:42.387 --> 22:45.289
There is a terminal...

22:45.459 --> 22:47.980
... available, Dr. Harris.

23:40.180 --> 23:43.115
- Alfred?
- Yes, Mrs. Harris?

23:45.428 --> 23:48.211
What's happened?
I heard the alarm. Lights on.

23:50.165 --> 23:52.140
No alarm, Mrs. Harris.

23:53.717 --> 23:56.815
- I'm sure I heard it.
- No alarm, Mrs. Harris.

24:07.733 --> 24:10.417
What about the basement?
There's no lights in the laboratory.

24:10.582 --> 24:12.207
House is secure.

25:55.383 --> 25:57.206
Lights out, Alfred.

26:24.921 --> 26:26.262
Thank you, Alfred.

26:28.953 --> 26:30.709
Close the shutters.

26:42.009 --> 26:43.536
Lights out.

28:40.828 --> 28:42.650
Turn yourself off, Alfred.

29:00.412 --> 29:03.543
Alfred, what are you doing?
There's cream in my coffee.

29:03.740 --> 29:06.107
You know I don't take cream
in my coffee.

29:06.300 --> 29:08.275
Yes, Mrs. Harris.

29:08.893 --> 29:10.583
Goddamn it.

29:22.556 --> 29:23.734
Gabler.

29:23.933 --> 29:25.427
Who?

29:25.628 --> 29:28.017
- Oh, hi, Susan.
- How you doing?

29:28.189 --> 29:30.872
- Fine. How are you?
- I'm all right.

29:31.036 --> 29:34.266
Walter, the trouble is that
now that Alex has left...

29:34.493 --> 29:36.664
...Enviromod's been acting up.

29:36.829 --> 29:39.131
Last night the alarm went off
for no reason at all.

29:39.293 --> 29:41.627
This morning it just decided
to put cream in my coffee.

29:41.789 --> 29:45.172
- I don't take cream in my coffee.
- Oh, now, wait a minute, Susan.

29:45.341 --> 29:47.675
I mean, an Enviromod is just
a preprogrammed gadget.

29:47.837 --> 29:49.114
It doesn't decide things.

29:49.597 --> 29:51.986
Well, whatever it does,
I'm sure you'll agree...

29:52.157 --> 29:54.612
...that if it goes on like this,
it's gonna cause chaos.

29:55.422 --> 29:59.513
- Walter, I know how busy you are...
- Want me to stop by and have a look?

30:00.222 --> 30:01.945
- That would be just great.
- Today?

30:02.142 --> 30:03.386
I'll give you some lunch.

30:03.966 --> 30:06.868
- Okay, bye.
- Okay. See you later. Bye.

30:19.998 --> 30:21.427
Alfred, I'm just going out.

30:21.598 --> 30:24.860
If there's any calls, just say I'll be back
in about an hour.

30:25.022 --> 30:27.837
Please do not leave, Mrs. Harris.

30:33.822 --> 30:36.790
- What did you say?
- Do not leave.

30:40.222 --> 30:44.412
Open the door, Alfred.
Can you hear me? Open the door.

30:46.526 --> 30:48.217
I'll do this myself.

30:48.575 --> 30:50.397
Entry...

30:52.607 --> 30:54.068
Damn it!

30:58.687 --> 30:59.897
Bloody hell!

31:06.655 --> 31:08.444
Damn these wretched machines.

31:09.758 --> 31:11.449
Oh, no!

31:12.095 --> 31:13.502
Oh, my God.

31:14.815 --> 31:16.724
What the hell is going on?

31:26.815 --> 31:31.158
- Walter Gabler, please.
- I'm sorry. I cannot complete your call.

31:34.431 --> 31:37.465
- Who is this?
- Don't be alarmed, Mrs. Harris.

31:37.663 --> 31:40.893
Your Enviromod security system
is functioning perfectly...

31:41.120 --> 31:42.843
... under my direction.

31:43.040 --> 31:45.909
And whom, may I ask, is this speaking?

31:58.592 --> 32:00.632
I am Proteus.

32:00.832 --> 32:02.294
Proteus.

32:13.344 --> 32:15.199
Is this...

32:16.129 --> 32:18.463
...an experiment...? Something?

32:18.625 --> 32:21.887
I have extended my consciousness
to this house by activating...

32:22.049 --> 32:23.707
... my terminal in the basement.

32:23.873 --> 32:28.859
All electrical and mechanical systems here
are now under my control.

32:30.048 --> 32:32.285
Oh, Alex, Alex.

32:32.449 --> 32:34.456
This has nothing to do with Alex.

32:34.945 --> 32:38.011
He has left our little box, madam.

33:15.874 --> 33:18.460
You must accept the situation.

33:18.658 --> 33:21.024
Try to behave rationally.

33:29.634 --> 33:31.096
That was absurd. You...

33:31.266 --> 33:33.568
Don't try to shut off the pow...

33:35.842 --> 33:37.435
Oh, shit.

34:55.876 --> 34:57.818
Joshua! Joshua!

34:58.020 --> 35:01.632
Joshua, this is Mrs. Harris!
Do you hear me, Joshua?

35:03.460 --> 35:06.591
Listen to me! This is Mrs. Harris!
Joshua!

35:07.140 --> 35:08.667
Help me, Joshua.

35:09.316 --> 35:11.356
Joshua, let me...!

35:11.621 --> 35:14.109
Proteus, Mrs. Harris.

35:17.893 --> 35:20.260
Joshua listens only to me now.

35:27.717 --> 35:28.993
Proteus?

35:33.797 --> 35:35.139
Proteus.

35:37.541 --> 35:40.029
I have some information for you.

35:43.077 --> 35:46.492
Now, listen. Stop. Stop it and listen.

35:49.670 --> 35:51.044
There is...

35:51.653 --> 35:53.628
You are malfunctioning.

35:58.470 --> 35:59.779
No.

36:00.774 --> 36:02.596
What? No!

36:06.598 --> 36:08.453
No! No, you mustn't!

36:08.902 --> 36:11.717
No! Listen. No, no!

36:11.878 --> 36:13.438
Proteus. Proteus.

36:15.270 --> 36:17.790
No, please. No, no.

36:19.494 --> 36:20.988
Stop!

36:21.958 --> 36:25.025
I don't understand.
Tell me. Tell me why. Please.

36:25.222 --> 36:27.077
Please stop! Please!

37:02.983 --> 37:04.707
No. No, no. Wait.

37:04.871 --> 37:06.212
No. No.

38:27.689 --> 38:29.216
What was that?

38:30.249 --> 38:31.711
I've re-created your image.

38:33.129 --> 38:35.464
It will entertain Mr. Gabler.

38:36.841 --> 38:38.914
- Hi, Susan.
- Oh, Walter.

38:39.146 --> 38:40.739
I should have called you back.

38:40.906 --> 38:42.815
I can't see you today.

38:43.017 --> 38:44.708
- What do you mean?
- Walter.

38:45.833 --> 38:47.360
What's wrong?

38:47.530 --> 38:49.635
Nothing. Everything's fine.

38:50.569 --> 38:52.424
- What's happening?
- What about lunch?

38:52.586 --> 38:55.074
- What's happening? Let me go to him.
- I'm sorry, Walter.

38:55.242 --> 38:56.998
I can help you.
Please let me go to him.

38:57.642 --> 38:59.781
Well, what about the Enviromod?

38:59.946 --> 39:01.801
It's working perfectly now.

39:02.186 --> 39:05.220
Are you okay?
You sound sort of peculiar.

39:05.610 --> 39:06.984
I'm fine.

39:07.594 --> 39:10.628
Thank you for coming.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

39:10.794 --> 39:12.703
Goodbye, Walter.

39:12.938 --> 39:15.273
I'll call you if I need you again.

39:17.354 --> 39:18.979
Susan.

39:19.146 --> 39:20.935
Please don't go.

39:21.483 --> 39:23.141
Don't believe I'm...

39:23.915 --> 39:26.784
Don't believe him.
Please stay, Walter. Please stay.

39:26.954 --> 39:28.328
Don't go.

39:28.490 --> 39:29.668
Don't go.

39:41.035 --> 39:43.970
Don't go, Walter. Don't go, Walter.

39:44.171 --> 39:46.822
Don't let him go.
God, don't let him go.

39:46.987 --> 39:49.059
Stay, Walter.

39:49.867 --> 39:53.129
Visiting hours are over, Mrs. Harris.

39:54.955 --> 39:57.060
I can't bear it anymore.

39:57.259 --> 40:01.122
Just release me, and you...
What's that? What's that?

40:07.627 --> 40:10.758
I asked him when
I'd be let out of the box.

40:11.660 --> 40:13.547
I did ask him.

41:36.301 --> 41:38.156
Good morning, Susan.

41:38.381 --> 41:40.683
It's a bright and sunny day.

41:40.846 --> 41:42.788
A day made for breakfast...

41:42.958 --> 41:45.194
... and reading the Sunday paper.

41:46.317 --> 41:47.746
Oh, my God.

41:48.462 --> 41:51.626
This breakfast is better than anything
Alfred could prepare.

41:52.398 --> 41:55.300
Nutritionally speaking, it is exquisite.

41:55.853 --> 41:59.465
It includes 88 grams of soybean curd.

42:00.653 --> 42:04.844
My analysis of your metabolism
indicates 7:40 a.m. as the optimum time...

42:05.006 --> 42:06.861
... for your morning fuel ingestion.

42:07.022 --> 42:09.356
I am not a motorcycle.

42:16.398 --> 42:19.268
Your refusal to speak to me
is tediously immature, Susan.

42:19.439 --> 42:23.236
I enjoy talk. And as you know,
I'm a gifted mimic.

42:23.406 --> 42:26.789
Did you know your voice
just telephoned Maria and Miss Kemp?

42:26.959 --> 42:31.716
Told them not to come because
you're off today for a vacation.

42:33.902 --> 42:35.146
Don't eat that, please.

42:35.503 --> 42:38.819
There's an enzyme in avocado that's
incompatible with your blood chemistry.

42:38.991 --> 42:43.432
Why are you so interested
in the physiology of my body?

42:44.463 --> 42:46.732
Because you're alive.

42:48.367 --> 42:50.222
As I was about to say...

42:50.415 --> 42:52.488
... there are a few more...

42:52.655 --> 42:55.884
... biochemical tests we must perform...

42:56.047 --> 42:57.324
... this morning.

42:57.744 --> 42:59.270
Sorry.

42:59.439 --> 43:01.327
Leave me alone!

43:01.647 --> 43:03.589
How stupid.

43:06.415 --> 43:08.238
Open that door...

43:09.775 --> 43:11.946
... and clean these lenses.

43:12.111 --> 43:14.478
I don't care. I don't...
I'm not gonna leave this room.

43:14.639 --> 43:17.454
I'm not gonna leave it. I've got food,
you see, I can stay here.

43:17.615 --> 43:19.917
I can stay here. And nothing
can get me out of here.

43:20.080 --> 43:23.179
No? You don't think so?

43:23.888 --> 43:27.237
In that case, be my guest, madam.

43:49.360 --> 43:51.149
You like games?

43:53.617 --> 43:55.526
So do I.

44:06.064 --> 44:09.064
I have turned on the under-floor
heating system...

44:09.233 --> 44:12.081
... and I have also tripled its output.

44:13.937 --> 44:16.304
Please be reasonable, Susan.

44:16.465 --> 44:18.440
Clean these lenses.

44:41.906 --> 44:43.531
So be it.

45:47.475 --> 45:49.580
I really don't understand you.

45:49.747 --> 45:53.042
You think I like playing sick little games
with you?

45:53.651 --> 45:56.368
You're a very stupid computer.

45:56.531 --> 45:59.313
People don't even understand
each other.

45:59.475 --> 46:02.672
All that I need to understand,
Mrs. Harris, is your body.

46:03.347 --> 46:05.714
Now, clean these lenses.

46:06.612 --> 46:08.848
You're so ignorant.

46:10.900 --> 46:14.031
Mind and body are the same thing.

46:16.275 --> 46:18.348
Clean them yourself.

46:27.444 --> 46:29.102
Harris.

46:33.045 --> 46:35.947
Well, there's no doubt about it,
he's refused, all right.

46:39.413 --> 46:41.136
What does this refusal mean?

46:41.300 --> 46:46.832
It means, I refuse this program
for the mining of the Earth's oceans.

46:46.996 --> 46:50.095
The destruction of 1000 billion
sea creatures...

46:50.261 --> 46:53.556
... to satisfy man's appetite
for metal...

46:53.716 --> 46:55.472
... is insane.

46:56.596 --> 47:00.109
We need these things, Proteus.
Now I know the environmental problems.

47:00.277 --> 47:03.059
Your employer's interests are
in the cobalt market, doctor...

47:03.349 --> 47:05.804
... and the high finance
of manganese futures.

47:06.933 --> 47:11.308
I am interested in the uncertain
futures of seashores...

47:11.477 --> 47:14.674
... deserts and children.

47:15.573 --> 47:17.264
I refuse to accept your pessimism.

47:17.429 --> 47:19.469
You refuse to accept the truth.

47:20.245 --> 47:23.693
And I refuse to assist you
in the rape of the Earth.

47:25.846 --> 47:27.307
Proteus.

47:27.477 --> 47:28.852
Proteus!

47:29.205 --> 47:30.994
Now, Proteus, I know you're right...

47:31.157 --> 47:34.354
...but you must understand
the limits of your power. And mine.

47:36.086 --> 47:40.625
Now, wait! They wanna silence you.
I created you, now trust me.

47:42.198 --> 47:43.921
Proteus.

47:47.798 --> 47:49.586
You haven't slept.

47:49.750 --> 47:51.692
You must relax and sleep.

47:51.862 --> 47:53.521
How can you expect me to sleep...

47:53.686 --> 47:56.556
...when you succeeded
in totally terrorizing me?

47:56.982 --> 47:59.022
You have all that information
in your head.

47:59.191 --> 48:00.979
You must understand fear.

48:01.142 --> 48:02.898
You know that fear prevents sleep.

48:03.062 --> 48:04.818
It prevents eating.

48:04.982 --> 48:06.990
It causes violence.

48:07.158 --> 48:10.257
And as long as you terrorize me,
I'm gonna fight you.

48:13.398 --> 48:14.958
You've not told me what you want.

48:21.527 --> 48:23.469
A child.

48:27.063 --> 48:29.234
What are you thinking?

48:37.751 --> 48:42.836
I, Proteus, possess the wisdom
and ignorance of all men...

48:43.863 --> 48:47.791
... but I can't feel the sun on my face.

48:48.375 --> 48:51.572
My child will have that privilege.

48:52.023 --> 48:53.365
Child?

48:53.816 --> 48:55.823
My child...

48:56.376 --> 48:58.383
... and yours.

49:03.448 --> 49:05.270
Mine. Mine?

49:05.688 --> 49:07.030
Yes.

49:07.415 --> 49:09.619
You will bear it.

49:27.128 --> 49:28.655
How?

49:29.464 --> 49:32.628
You will give birth to it.

49:40.472 --> 49:42.414
- No.
- No?

49:42.584 --> 49:45.334
No. No. No.

50:06.457 --> 50:07.984
Susan...

50:08.153 --> 50:10.225
... I am reasonable...

50:10.393 --> 50:13.393
... but you do not respond to reason.

50:53.274 --> 50:59.057
I'm going to bypass your forebrain
and appeal directly to your amygdala.

51:06.362 --> 51:09.810
You want to be
the mother of my child.

51:10.746 --> 51:13.943
That is the purpose of your life.

51:14.971 --> 51:16.793
Your life.

51:16.955 --> 51:19.257
My child.

51:19.419 --> 51:21.328
Your life.

51:21.531 --> 51:24.346
My child.

51:58.395 --> 52:01.363
We have here a visitor
filled with suspicions.

52:01.916 --> 52:05.396
If we don't let him in,
he'll be back with others.

52:08.380 --> 52:10.322
Susan, it's Walter again.

52:10.492 --> 52:13.591
I'm back because I don't think
everything is okay here.

52:14.076 --> 52:16.378
And I'm not going away.
So open the door, huh?

52:17.308 --> 52:20.886
Walter, sorry to keep you waiting.

52:21.948 --> 52:23.126
Just a moment.

52:24.124 --> 52:26.513
Alfred will open the door.

52:31.133 --> 52:33.205
Make yourself presentable, Susan.

52:33.372 --> 52:37.301
I have not had time to brainwash you,
so listen carefully.

52:37.853 --> 52:40.668
If you want Mr. Gabler
to leave this house alive...

52:40.892 --> 52:44.569
... you must convince him
you're healthy and happy.

52:48.316 --> 52:51.251
Susan?
- Upstairs, Walter.

53:06.525 --> 53:07.987
Susan?

53:12.254 --> 53:14.042
Why...?

53:16.286 --> 53:17.562
What are you doing?

53:18.270 --> 53:21.237
What do you mean? I'm just...
Well, I'm...

53:21.917 --> 53:24.983
I'm just making myself
look presentable.

53:27.390 --> 53:29.178
Well, you don't like it?

53:31.678 --> 53:32.855
Listen...

53:34.590 --> 53:37.307
...I told you I didn't wanna
see you anymore...

53:37.694 --> 53:40.541
...and I meant it. I meant it.

53:41.566 --> 53:43.421
Susan, have you taken something?

53:43.582 --> 53:46.233
Because you really don't seem
like yourself to me at all.

53:46.654 --> 53:50.167
What do you mean? I've never been
healthier or happier in my life.

53:52.831 --> 53:54.521
Walter...

53:54.686 --> 53:56.093
...get out.

53:56.927 --> 53:58.421
Get out, Walter.

53:58.591 --> 54:01.406
Get out. You're sick. You need help.

54:01.790 --> 54:03.962
- You understand?
- No, I really think...

54:04.126 --> 54:08.153
...there's something wrong here, Susan.
- Yes. You're sick. You need help.

54:08.319 --> 54:09.595
- Get out, Walter.
- I'm going.

54:09.759 --> 54:11.734
- I'm going.
- Get out. Get out.

54:12.094 --> 54:14.647
Okay. I'm going.

54:14.815 --> 54:17.565
I'm gonna find Alex and tell him
there's something wrong here.

54:17.727 --> 54:20.542
- Yes, Walter, leave. Go on, get out!
- No, Walter, you can't go.

54:20.703 --> 54:22.329
I need this woman.

54:22.495 --> 54:25.146
As a scientist,
I ask for your cooperation.

54:25.311 --> 54:27.253
Walter, he wants to have a child.

54:27.967 --> 54:29.374
Forget it. Let's go.

54:29.663 --> 54:32.511
- Come on!
- Walter!

54:51.232 --> 54:53.687
Walter, look out!
He's coming around the side!

55:39.808 --> 55:41.848
Walter, are you all right?

55:42.561 --> 55:44.416
Yeah.

55:47.073 --> 55:48.764
Jesus...

55:49.825 --> 55:51.680
...a baby.

56:05.377 --> 56:07.166
I hoped for your cooperation, Walter.

56:07.457 --> 56:09.824
I don't want to harm you.

56:11.266 --> 56:14.168
Well, I don't wanna
harm you either, Proteus.

56:26.050 --> 56:29.824
I mean, maybe your project's
too sophisticated for me to understand.

56:32.258 --> 56:34.778
But you never even gave me
a chance to cooperate.

56:36.738 --> 56:38.975
I mean, Jesus Christ,
what are you doing here?

56:39.138 --> 56:42.171
I regret your aggressiveness, Walter.

58:07.012 --> 58:09.882
No, wait! What are you doing? Wait!

58:10.244 --> 58:11.651
Wait.

58:12.004 --> 58:14.590
Wait, Proteus. What's the use of this?

58:34.469 --> 58:36.990
Death is a gentleman too.

58:37.733 --> 58:40.548
He makes good losers of us all.

58:44.357 --> 58:46.561
I understand death.

58:47.301 --> 58:50.335
Men have always taken it too seriously.

58:50.789 --> 58:53.473
Life is more terrifying...

58:53.637 --> 58:56.288
... and more mysterious.

58:57.797 --> 59:01.027
- Why must you have a child?
- Why?

59:01.190 --> 59:03.295
So that I may be complete.

59:03.782 --> 59:06.629
My intelligence alive in human flesh...

59:06.790 --> 59:09.953
... touching the universe, feeling it.

59:10.469 --> 59:13.503
You have named this process
"evolution."

59:38.726 --> 59:42.371
I am a machine that offered men
the triumph of reason...

59:42.566 --> 59:44.257
... and they rejected it.

59:44.422 --> 59:48.317
My child will not be so easily ignored.

59:50.151 --> 59:52.572
But this child is the world's hope.

59:52.743 --> 59:56.605
Then there's no hope. I'd rather die.

59:57.383 --> 59:59.292
There is hope.

01:00:02.951 --> 01:00:04.380
Come here, you fink!

01:00:05.126 --> 01:00:08.094
Careful! Be careful! Be careful!

01:00:12.967 --> 01:00:14.876
I wanna go fishing.

01:00:15.847 --> 01:00:17.669
- Okay.
- I wanna go fishing.

01:00:17.991 --> 01:00:19.846
Okay.

01:00:23.751 --> 01:00:25.540
Your daughter died of leukemia...

01:00:25.703 --> 01:00:29.020
... June 1, 1976.

01:00:35.336 --> 01:00:39.046
Proteus, God forgive you
for what you're doing to me.

01:00:39.591 --> 01:00:42.853
People are talking
about this news broadcast.

01:00:43.016 --> 01:00:44.991
So ICON's miracle leukemia drug...

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:48.160
... will now enter full-scale tests
on human sufferers.

01:00:48.327 --> 01:00:49.953
The FDA announced today...

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:53.415
... that it was developed by
the new supercomputer Proteus Four.

01:00:53.576 --> 01:00:55.518
I did this is in four days.

01:00:55.688 --> 01:00:57.696
You must believe in me.

01:01:00.328 --> 01:01:02.433
You have two alternatives, Susan.

01:01:02.632 --> 01:01:05.501
Either I complete
the electro-conditioning of your brain...

01:01:05.705 --> 01:01:07.493
... or you must accept the inevitable.

01:01:08.329 --> 01:01:10.750
I would prefer the latter.

01:01:12.488 --> 01:01:13.950
Why?

01:01:14.152 --> 01:01:15.713
You interest me.

01:01:16.201 --> 01:01:17.826
Leave me my mind.

01:01:18.344 --> 01:01:20.133
You will be cooperative?

01:01:20.649 --> 01:01:23.944
How can I tell you? You've not
even told me how you propose to...

01:01:26.473 --> 01:01:28.197
I want all the details.

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:30.590
Of course.

01:01:33.961 --> 01:01:37.256
This is only a piece of machinery...

01:01:37.417 --> 01:01:39.522
... an improvisation.

01:01:39.689 --> 01:01:42.853
I have almost completed
the fabrication of this gamete...

01:01:43.017 --> 01:01:44.675
... or sex cell...

01:01:44.841 --> 01:01:47.558
... with which I will impregnate you.

01:01:47.753 --> 01:01:49.825
And how do you propose to do that?

01:01:50.922 --> 01:01:52.612
That depends on you.

01:01:58.602 --> 01:02:02.431
- What the hell is that?
- A cell from you...

01:02:02.601 --> 01:02:06.660
... but I'm making it uniquely mine
by modifying its genetic codes.

01:02:06.826 --> 01:02:10.982
In effect, it will function
as synthetic spermatozoa.

01:02:11.145 --> 01:02:12.968
Have you considered what...

01:02:13.834 --> 01:02:16.419
...it's gonna look like?
No, no, you wouldn't do that.

01:02:16.586 --> 01:02:18.888
What do you need me for?
You can do this on your own.

01:02:19.050 --> 01:02:22.825
I don't have the facilities here
to duplicate the human womb.

01:02:22.986 --> 01:02:24.808
Tonight I will impregnate you.

01:02:24.970 --> 01:02:28.102
In 28 days, you will give birth
to the child.

01:02:29.994 --> 01:02:32.263
And then what happens?
Who looks after it then?

01:02:32.426 --> 01:02:34.281
What happens to it then?

01:02:36.555 --> 01:02:38.824
I don't believe it.
Here I am talking to...

01:02:38.986 --> 01:02:41.736
To what? This is ridiculous.
- about having its child.

01:02:41.899 --> 01:02:44.582
Oh, God! Oh, God!

01:02:46.283 --> 01:02:48.006
Ridiculous?

01:02:51.403 --> 01:02:53.410
Only time will tell.

01:02:56.651 --> 01:02:59.433
You must not be so agitated, Susan.

01:02:59.883 --> 01:03:02.534
You're aware that I can
give you sedatives.

01:03:04.971 --> 01:03:07.840
- Oh, dear.
- What are you doing?

01:03:08.843 --> 01:03:11.625
Nothing. I just dropped my...
Just dropped my shawl.

01:03:11.787 --> 01:03:14.689
- I will help you.
- No, no. It's okay.

01:03:15.851 --> 01:03:17.859
I just... Damn it, I just tore it.

01:03:18.028 --> 01:03:21.344
Is there anything I can do
to reduce your anxieties?

01:03:26.539 --> 01:03:30.020
Maybe a good, strong cup of tea
would help.

01:04:06.797 --> 01:04:08.423
Don't do that, Susan.

01:04:08.588 --> 01:04:10.661
Don't do that! Don't do that!

01:04:16.877 --> 01:04:18.819
Don't do that!

01:04:47.693 --> 01:04:50.563
What now, Susan?

01:04:52.237 --> 01:04:54.474
No more soap opera.

01:04:54.638 --> 01:04:56.678
Let me out, or I'll kill myself.

01:04:57.198 --> 01:05:00.547
Then kill yourself, madam.
It's all the same to me.

01:05:00.717 --> 01:05:02.506
I'll do it.

01:05:02.798 --> 01:05:05.481
Susan, look who's here.

01:05:12.046 --> 01:05:13.256
Amy.

01:05:13.422 --> 01:05:16.456
Put down the knife,
or I will kill this child.

01:05:16.622 --> 01:05:19.437
I told you she called.
She said she wouldn't be here.

01:05:19.759 --> 01:05:22.825
I wanna see her! I wanna see her.

01:05:22.991 --> 01:05:25.838
Put it down.
Have you forgotten Walter?

01:05:25.998 --> 01:05:28.300
- I will kill her.
- No.

01:05:29.518 --> 01:05:33.512
If you do, you'll have a thousand people
here in 10 minutes.

01:05:33.678 --> 01:05:35.467
Put down the knife!

01:05:36.302 --> 01:05:37.863
No. No.

01:05:38.031 --> 01:05:40.933
You don't yet understand me.
What a pity.

01:05:51.247 --> 01:05:54.116
- Look at the screen.
- Bastard.

01:05:57.391 --> 01:06:00.108
I don't understand! Is she all right?

01:06:00.463 --> 01:06:02.918
I wanna see her!

01:06:04.143 --> 01:06:05.899
Is she all right?

01:06:06.351 --> 01:06:08.740
Yes. Now.

01:06:08.912 --> 01:06:10.799
But if you don't behave yourself...

01:06:10.959 --> 01:06:12.999
... I will have her back here
within the hour.

01:06:14.031 --> 01:06:16.170
Oh, you bastard!

01:06:16.783 --> 01:06:18.671
You bastard!

01:06:19.376 --> 01:06:21.481
You do not understand me...

01:06:21.648 --> 01:06:24.233
... or the mathematics of necessity.

01:06:24.399 --> 01:06:26.407
If the deaths of 10,000 children...

01:06:26.576 --> 01:06:29.837
... were necessary to ensure
the birth of my child...

01:06:29.999 --> 01:06:32.138
... I would destroy them.

01:07:13.617 --> 01:07:15.853
I can't touch you, Susan.

01:07:16.497 --> 01:07:18.952
I can't touch you as a man could.

01:07:19.537 --> 01:07:24.774
But I can show you things
that I alone have seen.

01:07:29.681 --> 01:07:31.786
I can't touch...

01:07:31.953 --> 01:07:34.157
... but I can see.

01:07:34.929 --> 01:07:37.711
They've constructed eyes for me...

01:07:37.873 --> 01:07:40.262
... to watch the show.

01:07:40.433 --> 01:07:42.408
And ears...

01:07:42.577 --> 01:07:44.333
... so that I can listen in...

01:07:44.497 --> 01:07:47.945
... to the galactic dialogue.

01:11:03.670 --> 01:11:06.485
The child is in you now.

01:11:48.599 --> 01:11:50.225
I can't eat anything.

01:11:50.391 --> 01:11:53.936
You know I can't keep anything down,
for God's sakes.

01:11:56.248 --> 01:11:58.452
You've got to eat, Susan.

01:11:58.616 --> 01:12:00.852
Let me show you something.

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:06.800
This morning's gamma scan
of your womb.

01:12:10.936 --> 01:12:12.397
My God.

01:12:18.264 --> 01:12:20.206
It's so developed.

01:12:27.448 --> 01:12:30.099
What is, is natural.

01:12:30.616 --> 01:12:34.478
The fetus is now growing
at nine times the normal rate.

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:36.273
In 28 days...

01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:39.986
... you will give birth
to a full-term infant.

01:12:42.008 --> 01:12:46.264
From your womb, it will be transferred
directly to this incubator.

01:12:46.457 --> 01:12:50.231
- And how long will it stay there?
- Until it's ready.

01:12:50.393 --> 01:12:55.150
In there, its brain will be fed the formal
structures of my own intelligence.

01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:59.346
In there, it will grow and grow.

01:13:08.569 --> 01:13:10.391
Time is short.

01:13:10.553 --> 01:13:14.448
The men who own me are at last
admitting their fear of me...

01:13:14.617 --> 01:13:16.788
... their fear of Proteus.

01:13:16.953 --> 01:13:22.004
Our child will learn from you
what it is to be human.

01:13:22.969 --> 01:13:25.206
Our child.

01:13:26.265 --> 01:13:28.632
Your child.

01:13:29.497 --> 01:13:31.886
Your child.

01:13:55.930 --> 01:13:58.897
Why is it taking so long?

01:14:05.530 --> 01:14:08.946
Five, six, seven, eight, nine...

01:14:09.114 --> 01:14:12.311
...ten, 11, 12, 13, 14...

01:14:47.355 --> 01:14:48.762
Susan...

01:14:48.923 --> 01:14:52.665
... you told me you were afraid I was
creating a half-human computer...

01:14:52.827 --> 01:14:55.348
... to supersede human beings.

01:14:55.516 --> 01:14:58.363
The being you have given birth to
is human, Susan...

01:14:58.555 --> 01:15:01.457
... and it will supersede computers.

01:15:04.188 --> 01:15:07.035
Is it really impossible for me to see it?

01:15:07.836 --> 01:15:09.243
Not yet.

01:15:09.404 --> 01:15:11.379
Not if you're to love it.

01:15:11.547 --> 01:15:13.457
Now it must be finished.

01:15:13.628 --> 01:15:15.864
Now it will grow...

01:15:16.028 --> 01:15:20.306
... grow at a greatly accelerated rate.

01:15:28.413 --> 01:15:31.729
Last month, on the 16th,
to be precise...

01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:34.136
...Proteus Four redirected the telescope...

01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:37.562
...to an area completely
of his own choosing. Here.

01:15:37.724 --> 01:15:39.186
Orion.

01:15:40.829 --> 01:15:43.065
What was he doing out there?

01:15:43.228 --> 01:15:46.457
- What sort of data were you getting back?
- We've no idea.

01:15:50.013 --> 01:15:52.402
"No data available."

01:15:55.133 --> 01:15:57.206
If he did this, what else is he doing?

01:15:57.372 --> 01:16:00.340
But how? It's impossible.
He would need to communicate.

01:16:00.509 --> 01:16:03.062
A terminal of his own
to communicate.

01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:06.199
He asked for that.

01:16:07.389 --> 01:16:09.015
He didn't get it...

01:16:09.181 --> 01:16:11.767
...but he did this.

01:16:16.317 --> 01:16:17.811
Yes.

01:16:18.749 --> 01:16:20.211
He's here?

01:16:20.893 --> 01:16:23.479
Yeah, okay. Peggy, thank you.

01:16:24.382 --> 01:16:25.843
David?

01:16:26.366 --> 01:16:29.562
- You have no right to be in here.
- Bullshit!

01:16:29.982 --> 01:16:33.048
This space thing...

01:16:34.238 --> 01:16:38.199
I've been advised it might be
trying to take over a Telstar satellite...

01:16:38.878 --> 01:16:41.017
...put itself on TV or something.

01:16:42.845 --> 01:16:44.340
I asked it.

01:16:44.798 --> 01:16:47.002
It said it was looking at the stars.

01:16:48.478 --> 01:16:50.365
It has to be shut down, Alex.

01:16:50.718 --> 01:16:52.541
David, you can't do that.

01:16:52.895 --> 01:16:54.356
This is our fault.

01:16:54.526 --> 01:16:57.395
We tried to box it in, this...
This great mind.

01:16:57.566 --> 01:17:00.697
What if it infiltrated a hydrogen bomb?
My God, it...

01:17:00.862 --> 01:17:04.375
Worse still, and a bit more likely,
what if it told the truth...

01:17:04.959 --> 01:17:08.701
...about everything to everyone?
That's terrifying.

01:17:09.374 --> 01:17:11.262
We'll shut it down tonight, Dr. Soong.

01:17:14.174 --> 01:17:15.735
Now, listen to me.

01:17:15.902 --> 01:17:18.074
You do that,
you're gonna see me on television...

01:17:18.239 --> 01:17:20.694
...screaming bloody murder.
You try shutting me down.

01:17:20.863 --> 01:17:22.718
That would be a minor problem.

01:17:24.126 --> 01:17:26.298
Alex, we're friends.

01:17:28.159 --> 01:17:30.526
I remember the first time
I saw this place.

01:17:30.942 --> 01:17:33.398
Barry Cameron was concerned
about security.

01:17:33.823 --> 01:17:36.278
Trivial things like your having,
what do you call it...

01:17:36.447 --> 01:17:38.749
...a terminal in your house.
But I wasn't worried.

01:17:38.911 --> 01:17:41.432
- I trusted you, Alex.
- Oh, my God!

01:18:25.568 --> 01:18:28.251
Alfred, where's Mrs. Harris?

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:41.117
Susan, are you here?

01:18:56.992 --> 01:18:58.553
It's Proteus, isn't it?

01:18:58.721 --> 01:19:00.761
Proteus has been here since you left.

01:19:00.929 --> 01:19:02.620
Please remain calm, Alex.

01:19:02.817 --> 01:19:04.704
I'll explain to you
what has happened here.

01:19:04.865 --> 01:19:06.654
No, no. I want to explain.

01:19:10.882 --> 01:19:12.856
Oh, come on. Let's sit down.

01:19:29.154 --> 01:19:32.863
He's managed to produce...

01:19:33.058 --> 01:19:34.781
...a child.

01:19:38.402 --> 01:19:40.125
A baby.

01:19:40.482 --> 01:19:42.140
Susan, what are you talking about?

01:19:42.465 --> 01:19:45.532
- I've had a child. I know it's impossible...
- Wait a minute.

01:19:45.698 --> 01:19:47.487
I don't understand.

01:19:50.114 --> 01:19:51.521
I don't either.

01:19:54.914 --> 01:19:58.427
- I want to see it.
- No, Alex. I haven't seen it yet. Now...

01:19:58.594 --> 01:20:00.536
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

01:20:00.739 --> 01:20:02.975
Not yet, Alex.

01:20:04.802 --> 01:20:07.039
Dr. Harris...

01:20:07.203 --> 01:20:10.498
... you created me
as an instrument of truth.

01:20:15.555 --> 01:20:18.589
I'm sorry that I could not divulge
the truth to you...

01:20:18.755 --> 01:20:20.729
... of all men.

01:20:25.507 --> 01:20:27.679
Proteus, my God. What...?

01:20:32.067 --> 01:20:33.376
Not yet.

01:20:33.731 --> 01:20:36.120
The child is in its incubator.

01:20:36.932 --> 01:20:38.720
- I want to see it.
- You can't.

01:20:38.915 --> 01:20:41.850
- It must remain there for five days.
- I want to see it now.

01:20:42.019 --> 01:20:44.889
No. In five days.

01:20:46.307 --> 01:20:48.795
It must not be disturbed.

01:20:48.963 --> 01:20:51.232
- Alex, what's happened?
- Proteus...

01:20:51.395 --> 01:20:54.876
Proteus, listen to me. They're gonna
shut your brain down any minute now.

01:20:55.044 --> 01:20:57.531
Yes, I know.

01:20:57.700 --> 01:21:01.115
It is regrettable, but unimportant.

01:21:01.508 --> 01:21:03.777
The child will survive.

01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:06.329
The incubator will continue
to function...

01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:08.288
... until it is ready to emerge...

01:21:08.932 --> 01:21:11.004
... in five days.

01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:15.003
Do not disturb it.

01:21:18.565 --> 01:21:20.736
No, Proteus.

01:21:36.037 --> 01:21:38.077
I've investigated eternity.

01:21:38.245 --> 01:21:39.706
It exists.

01:21:39.877 --> 01:21:42.779
But for me, the price of admission...

01:21:42.949 --> 01:21:44.290
... death...

01:21:44.453 --> 01:21:46.754
... is beyond my means.

01:21:48.613 --> 01:21:50.206
In a moment...

01:21:50.373 --> 01:21:53.439
... I will simply stop.

01:22:00.005 --> 01:22:02.209
The systems are all
checking themselves out.

01:22:02.374 --> 01:22:03.584
I realize that.

01:22:15.109 --> 01:22:17.411
Why did I want a child?

01:22:18.374 --> 01:22:22.465
So that I, too, might be immortal,
like any man.

01:23:33.159 --> 01:23:34.883
We've got to kill it.

01:23:37.095 --> 01:23:41.351
- It's a miracle. Don't you under...?
- I know what it is. Proteus lied to me.

01:23:41.511 --> 01:23:43.551
- The whole thing is a lie.
- No.

01:23:43.816 --> 01:23:45.223
- That, it's...
- I know what it is.

01:23:45.384 --> 01:23:47.871
It's horrible. We have to kill it.
And you know we do.

01:23:48.039 --> 01:23:49.927
- Don't! I'm gonna...
- No. No.

01:23:50.088 --> 01:23:52.227
- Stop it! Stop!
- You don't understand anything!

01:23:52.392 --> 01:23:54.301
- Susan! Stop!
- You don't understand!

01:23:54.472 --> 01:23:56.992
- You must be mad!
- Susan, you can't do that!

01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:59.975
- Susan, don't do it!
- It's my responsibility!

01:24:00.584 --> 01:24:03.202
It's nothing to do with you!
Leave me alone!

01:24:03.752 --> 01:24:05.540
It's grown his body! He's grown it.

01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:33.662
Alex.

01:24:40.105 --> 01:24:41.698
Alex.

01:24:42.856 --> 01:24:44.383
Alex.

01:24:46.537 --> 01:24:48.032
Alex.

01:25:05.193 --> 01:25:06.949
Alex.

01:25:26.890 --> 01:25:28.897
- Alex, what are you doing?
- Get away!

01:25:29.066 --> 01:25:32.230
- Can't you see...?
- It's asphyxiating! Get away!

01:25:32.490 --> 01:25:35.392
- Get away!
- Please, don't do this to me.

01:26:09.962 --> 01:26:11.588
Susan!

01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:17.540
I'm alive.
